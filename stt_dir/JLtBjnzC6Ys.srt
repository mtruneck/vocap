1
0:0:1,36 --> 0:0:3,96
Anyone watching,
thinking we know fuck all


2
0:0:3,96 --> 0:0:6,0
about knowing fuck all about owt,


3
0:0:6,0 --> 0:0:8,36
needs to watch their back.


4
0:0:8,36 --> 0:0:11,52
So, you've had your Labour
reclassifying skunk,


5
0:0:11,52 --> 0:0:13,24
sending prices sky-high,


6
0:0:13,24 --> 0:0:17,8
literally, literally, taking
the grass from its own roots.


7
0:0:17,8 --> 0:0:19,96
Now you've got your Con-Dem nation,


8
0:0:19,96 --> 0:0:23,36
Liberals noshing Tories
like altar boys picking dimps up.


9
0:0:23,36 --> 0:0:28,0
Have we had a national
fucking stroke or what?


10
0:0:28,0 --> 0:0:31,16
Is revolution a word,
or was it never?


11
0:0:31,16 --> 0:0:33,6
Anybody watching needs to know,


12
0:0:33,6 --> 0:0:37,4
we cope better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.


13
0:0:37,4 --> 0:0:39,88
Well, for fuck's sake,
we live in Manchester


14
0:0:39,88 --> 0:0:43,12
and they charge us for water.


15
0:0:43,12 --> 0:0:47,92
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found.


16
0:0:47,92 --> 0:0:51,64
This green and pleasant land
in ancient times...


17
0:0:51,64 --> 0:0:54,24
Yak, yak, yak, yak,
yak, yak, yak, yak, yak!


18
0:0:54,24 --> 0:0:57,52
It's not theirs any more.


19
0:0:57,52 --> 0:1:1,4
This is our England now.


20
0:1:1,4 --> 0:1:7,72
Party!


21
0:1:7,72 --> 0:1:10,96
Can someone please
explain the criteria for a lie


22
0:1:10,96 --> 0:1:12,84
to be a little white lie?


23
0:1:12,84 --> 0:1:15,72
Whose standard
are we measuring this by?


24
0:1:15,72 --> 0:1:19,8
Why don't we have labels
for other sizes of lies?


25
0:1:19,8 --> 0:1:24,0
Lies that are off-white,
or darkening shades of grey,


26
0:1:24,0 --> 0:1:32,2
until in the end they turn to big
dirty pitch-black abominations?


27
0:1:32,2 --> 0:1:34,64
Uh-oh!
Uh-oh!


28
0:1:34,64 --> 0:1:38,56
Uh-oh. A big rub.


29
0:1:38,56 --> 0:1:43,84
Wow!


30
0:1:43,84 --> 0:1:52,4
It pains me to admit it, but I never
thought she'd be this good.


31
0:1:52,4 --> 0:1:56,92
Er... need to change
the barrel, yeah?


32
0:1:56,92 --> 0:2:8,76
What for?


33
0:2:8,76 --> 0:2:36,24
Jamie!


34
0:2:36,24 --> 0:2:39,4
Oh, shit.
Are you taking the piss?


35
0:2:39,4 --> 0:2:57,4
Mam! Mam, leave it, leave it.


36
0:2:57,4 --> 0:3:1,52
Paddy?!


37
0:3:1,52 --> 0:3:8,6
Get in!


38
0:3:8,6 --> 0:3:10,32
He just couldn't go quietly,
could he?


39
0:3:10,32 --> 0:3:13,92
Lady Diana had less people
lining the streets.


40
0:3:13,92 --> 0:3:15,36
God rest her soul.


41
0:3:15,36 --> 0:3:18,68
When did he die?


42
0:3:18,68 --> 0:3:20,76
Right?
What are you doing?


43
0:3:20,76 --> 0:3:26,52
Whoo!


44
0:3:26,52 --> 0:3:30,4
I'm surprised
they weren't wearing balaclavas.


45
0:3:30,4 --> 0:3:33,6
Ooh, that's a pretty one.


46
0:3:33,6 --> 0:3:35,68
It's fucking lovely, Mimi!


47
0:3:35,68 --> 0:3:38,24
All right, mate? How's it going?


48
0:3:38,24 --> 0:3:39,56
Hiya.


49
0:3:39,56 --> 0:3:41,92
All right?


50
0:3:41,92 --> 0:3:43,84
How's it going, man?


51
0:3:43,84 --> 0:3:46,52
Hey, I thought the IRA
gave all their guns to the filth.


52
0:3:46,52 --> 0:3:54,4
Yeah, well,
plenty slipped through the net.


53
0:3:54,4 --> 0:3:56,36
Shane, cheers, mate.
Good stuff.


54
0:3:56,36 --> 0:3:59,52
See you, love, take care.


55
0:3:59,52 --> 0:4:2,92
Nice weapon. Ha-ha-ha.


56
0:4:2,92 --> 0:4:4,92
Talk about drawing attention, though.


57
0:4:4,92 --> 0:4:9,12
He's not stupid.
Now the police think he's dead,
he can start all over.


58
0:4:9,12 --> 0:4:12,88
So, where is he?
Got off to Thailand, didn't he?


59
0:4:12,88 --> 0:4:15,28
He'll be sipping cocktails
on a beach somewhere in Koh Samui.


60
0:4:15,28 --> 0:4:18,36
Or hanging out with some underage
brass in Patpingpong.


61
0:4:18,36 --> 0:4:20,8
Yeah!
Ah, fuck this.


62
0:4:20,8 --> 0:4:23,72
Hiya, Mimi.
Hiya.


63
0:4:23,72 --> 0:4:25,84
Fill your boots, lads.


64
0:4:25,84 --> 0:4:29,56
'A Moss Side man has been
arrested on suspicion of arson.


65
0:4:29,56 --> 0:4:32,64
'The arrest follows
a three-month-long investigation


66
0:4:32,64 --> 0:4:36,4
'of a suspected firebomb attack
on a house in...'


67
0:4:36,4 --> 0:4:39,44
I need pushing to Chesney's.
Well, why can't he take you?


68
0:4:39,44 --> 0:4:46,28
He's got to further his education
so he ends up nothing like you.


69
0:4:46,28 --> 0:4:51,44
Oh!


70
0:4:51,44 --> 0:4:54,52
Oh! Spare the fucking rod, Patty.


71
0:4:54,52 --> 0:4:57,8
This is the 21st century.
You can't buy a flagon of mead
in the Jockey, you know.


72
0:4:57,8 --> 0:5:0,84
And live rent-free as well?
Well, helping out covers that.


73
0:5:0,84 --> 0:5:3,8
Tinned food and chip shops?
Tight bitch.


74
0:5:3,8 --> 0:5:7,84
How many fucking brain cells
is that gonna help me batter?


75
0:5:7,84 --> 0:5:10,72
Take a look around, Frank.


76
0:5:10,72 --> 0:5:12,96
All those child benefits, long gone.


77
0:5:12,96 --> 0:5:14,56
Carl looks after me.


78
0:5:14,56 --> 0:5:18,4
Occasionally. It's my money
that keeps you going.


79
0:5:18,4 --> 0:5:21,72
Plus, I couldn't trust you
with any more than a tenner.


80
0:5:21,72 --> 0:5:24,36
It was a one-off.


81
0:5:24,36 --> 0:5:27,4
You would think I'd risk bankrolling


82
0:5:27,4 --> 0:5:30,52
such disgusting behaviour
at Lillian's again?


83
0:5:30,52 --> 0:5:34,56
It's a proven timeless cure
for lovesickness.


84
0:5:34,56 --> 0:5:41,64
Even if you can't get it up?


85
0:5:41,64 --> 0:5:45,48
You should never have driven Libby
away. Yeah, yeah, yeah.


86
0:5:45,48 --> 0:5:50,8
If you'd kept it in your pants,
she'd still be here.


87
0:5:50,8 --> 0:5:53,96
'We want you to ring in
and tell us your ideas...'


88
0:5:53,96 --> 0:5:56,76
Cigs, please, Ches.
And some green papers.


89
0:5:56,76 --> 0:6:0,2
Hiya!


90
0:6:0,2 --> 0:6:2,64
Chesney!


91
0:6:2,64 --> 0:6:5,6
How long have you been there?
You need to speak up, love.


92
0:6:5,6 --> 0:6:8,44
I'll have you for discrimination.


93
0:6:8,44 --> 0:6:10,8
Doubt it.


94
0:6:10,8 --> 0:6:15,32
Keep your pork faggots!


95
0:6:15,32 --> 0:6:18,28
Hey, little man.
Procession was a bit OTT,
wasn't it?


96
0:6:18,28 --> 0:6:21,52
You just practise looking sad.
Like the tears of a clown.


97
0:6:21,52 --> 0:6:24,16
How's business?
Demand's definitely there.


98
0:6:24,16 --> 0:6:27,12
I could do four parties tomorrow
if I had the staff.


99
0:6:27,12 --> 0:6:28,6
Staff?


100
0:6:28,6 --> 0:6:31,64
Shit. I have. I've double-booked.


101
0:6:31,64 --> 0:6:33,4
Relying on other people
can be hard work.


102
0:6:33,4 --> 0:6:35,0
I thought you were supporting me.


103
0:6:35,0 --> 0:6:37,72
You know I am. So, then,
why do you keep avoiding me?


104
0:6:37,72 --> 0:6:41,4
I love what you're doing.


105
0:6:41,4 --> 0:6:43,88
Lend us 500 quid, then.
It's cheap for a reason, Karen.


106
0:6:43,88 --> 0:6:51,68
No, no, it's not cheap
when you see what it can do.


107
0:6:51,68 --> 0:7:0,0
You look after me
and I might show you what I can do.


108
0:7:0,0 --> 0:7:2,68
What's up with you?
Not still missing Libby, are you?


109
0:7:2,68 --> 0:7:6,8
Oh, fuck me! Hello!
Vernon Francis doesn't lose any kip


110
0:7:6,8 --> 0:7:10,8
cos the latest split-arse
can't deal with the heat.


111
0:7:10,8 --> 0:7:13,36
Everyone can see right through you!


112
0:7:13,36 --> 0:7:15,6
Tell me, do I look bothered?


113
0:7:15,6 --> 0:7:21,48
Don't feel sorry for him.
You all saw how he treated her.


114
0:7:21,48 --> 0:7:25,24
25% off any of the girls
except Marcie and Mandy.


115
0:7:25,24 --> 0:7:28,92
They've just been vagazzled.
Swarovski.


116
0:7:28,92 --> 0:7:30,4
Oh!


117
0:7:30,4 --> 0:7:33,52
Do I look like some low-life punter
with zero self-respect?


118
0:7:33,52 --> 0:7:36,56
No offence, of course.


119
0:7:36,56 --> 0:7:42,76
Suit yourself.
Ah!


120
0:7:42,76 --> 0:7:47,32
Oh! This bloody pub!


121
0:7:47,32 --> 0:7:49,32
She'll be perfect.


122
0:7:49,32 --> 0:7:51,24
I just need two more now.


123
0:7:51,24 --> 0:7:55,6
You've got no chance.


124
0:7:55,6 --> 0:7:57,84
Where there's a will...


125
0:7:57,84 --> 0:8:1,48
I'm sick of it! How am I supposed
to get in and out on my own?


126
0:8:1,48 --> 0:8:3,52
Now what are you whinging on about?


127
0:8:3,52 --> 0:8:6,32
Your toilets.
You couldn't swing a cat in there.


128
0:8:6,32 --> 0:8:10,52
Oh, yack, yack, yack.
Buy a drink or shut the fuck up.


129
0:8:10,52 --> 0:8:13,2
If they're too small
I'll have you for discrimination.


130
0:8:13,2 --> 0:8:17,28
Whoa! Fucking...
Dr Quinn, Medicine Woman.


131
0:8:17,28 --> 0:8:19,96
Lower than a rattlesnake's clout.


132
0:8:19,96 --> 0:8:21,8
Oh.
Agreed!


133
0:8:21,8 --> 0:8:24,24
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?


134
0:8:24,24 --> 0:8:25,48
There's nothing worse.


135
0:8:25,48 --> 0:8:28,6
Grasses make me sick.
I haven't done anything!


136
0:8:28,6 --> 0:8:32,24
And there's nothing for you to do
if you're already barred.


137
0:8:32,24 --> 0:8:34,8
Oh!


138
0:8:34,8 --> 0:8:38,6
Back at the gaff, Strangelove!


139
0:8:38,6 --> 0:8:42,0
I know they weren't together,
but Mimi has just lost her husband.


140
0:8:42,0 --> 0:8:43,44
That Scouse bitch
shouldn't speak to me like that.


141
0:8:43,44 --> 0:8:44,96
They're gangsters!


142
0:8:44,96 --> 0:8:47,64
More plastic than
a Tupperware party.


143
0:8:47,64 --> 0:8:49,84
I remember when
Manchester had real villains.


144
0:8:49,84 --> 0:8:53,8
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Old-school QSG?


145
0:8:53,8 --> 0:8:56,6
Those old fuckers wouldn't last
ten minutes on the streets today.


146
0:8:56,6 --> 0:9:0,24
You don't mess with the Maguires.
Half-breed tinkers? Don't scare me.


147
0:9:0,24 --> 0:9:3,36
Here. Read that bit.


148
0:9:3,36 --> 0:9:5,92
"2.2 by 1.8..."


149
0:9:5,92 --> 0:9:7,28
Mm-hm.
Er...


150
0:9:7,28 --> 0:9:9,52
"With a minimum turning circle
of 1.5 metres."


151
0:9:9,52 --> 0:9:15,32
Right, come on.


152
0:9:15,32 --> 0:9:17,96
That's it there.
See?


153
0:9:17,96 --> 0:9:22,52
Knew it! Miles out.
Pass me the phone.


154
0:9:22,52 --> 0:9:30,8
It's about time somebody stood up
to those bullies.


155
0:9:30,8 --> 0:9:40,92
Sorry for your loss.


156
0:9:40,92 --> 0:9:46,32
That's every police station
in South Manchester.


157
0:9:46,32 --> 0:9:57,36
Something wrong with your legs?
What am I supposed to put the ale in?


158
0:9:57,36 --> 0:9:59,72
Do us a favour, will you?
Collect some glasses.


159
0:9:59,72 --> 0:10:6,64
I've done a lot worse
for a lot less.


160
0:10:6,64 --> 0:10:17,96
I'm gonna go lie down
a minute, yeah?


161
0:10:17,96 --> 0:10:19,84
Why can't you juggle like that?


162
0:10:19,84 --> 0:10:26,84
Because that knobhead
was born a clown.


163
0:10:26,84 --> 0:10:28,84
Karma police.


164
0:10:28,84 --> 0:10:32,28
Paddy Maguire, bang to rights.


165
0:10:32,28 --> 0:10:36,16
Hey, what's the odds
on old nick-nack Paddy-whack


166
0:10:36,16 --> 0:10:39,12
drifting off all peaceful
with a smile on his napper?


167
0:10:39,12 --> 0:10:41,28
Fucking no chance.


168
0:10:41,28 --> 0:10:43,44
Chuckie ar la.


169
0:10:43,44 --> 0:10:50,76
Bet half of him's not even in there,
know what I mean? Vroom!


170
0:10:50,76 --> 0:10:51,92
Think he is chopped up?


171
0:10:51,92 --> 0:10:53,68
What happened
to you chatting me up?


172
0:10:53,68 --> 0:10:55,8
What's the point
if you won't let me do anything?


173
0:10:55,8 --> 0:10:58,88
Gaz Sharpe gave me this just
to watch me bend over from behind.


174
0:10:58,88 --> 0:11:0,28
I only want a kiss.


175
0:11:0,28 --> 0:11:3,52
A kiss is actual contact. Intimate.


176
0:11:3,52 --> 0:11:6,48
Even prostitutes don't do that.


177
0:11:6,48 --> 0:11:14,4
I'll have to work out
what it's worth.


178
0:11:14,4 --> 0:11:16,28
What do we want?
Toilets!


179
0:11:16,28 --> 0:11:17,84
When do we want them?
Now!


180
0:11:17,84 --> 0:11:18,84
What do we want?


181
0:11:18,84 --> 0:11:20,24
What the...?


182
0:11:20,24 --> 0:11:21,64
When do we want them?
Now!


183
0:11:21,64 --> 0:11:23,68
What do we want?
Toilets!


184
0:11:23,68 --> 0:11:25,88
When do we want them?
You're having a laugh.


185
0:11:25,88 --> 0:11:27,72
What do we want?
Toilets!


186
0:11:27,72 --> 0:11:29,12
When do we want them?
Now!


187
0:11:29,12 --> 0:11:31,12
What do we want?
Toilets!


188
0:11:31,12 --> 0:11:34,56
When do we want them?
Get the fuck away from my pub!


189
0:11:34,56 --> 0:11:36,6
They're disabled!


190
0:11:36,6 --> 0:11:38,68
So, they should know better!


191
0:11:38,68 --> 0:11:43,6
You stupid bitch!
This is a peaceful demonstration!


192
0:11:43,6 --> 0:11:45,48
Someone call the police!


193
0:11:45,48 --> 0:11:47,88
Jamie!


194
0:11:47,88 --> 0:11:51,24
Get away from me, you lunatic!


195
0:11:51,24 --> 0:11:53,64
You'll get nicked
for being on the premises!


196
0:11:53,64 --> 0:11:57,12
Leave her alone!
Jamie!


197
0:11:57,12 --> 0:11:59,8
Jamie, do something!


198
0:11:59,8 --> 0:12:2,2
Mam!


199
0:12:2,2 --> 0:12:5,0
Mam!


200
0:12:5,0 --> 0:12:7,68
We don't need any trouble
with that coffin around.


201
0:12:7,68 --> 0:12:10,32
We'll do it.
Someone sees sense.


202
0:12:10,32 --> 0:12:14,4
You'll change both toilets?
Men's and women's.


203
0:12:14,4 --> 0:12:17,48
And a ramp?


204
0:12:17,48 --> 0:12:19,84
And am I still barred?


205
0:12:19,84 --> 0:12:22,64
No.


206
0:12:22,64 --> 0:12:28,4
It's the right thing to do.


207
0:12:28,4 --> 0:12:33,48
Jamie! Jamie!


208
0:12:33,48 --> 0:12:36,32
Jamie?


209
0:12:36,32 --> 0:12:40,72
Jamie!


210
0:12:40,72 --> 0:12:44,48
Jay!


211
0:12:44,48 --> 0:12:46,56
Wonder how he really died.


212
0:12:46,56 --> 0:12:48,72
Probably had a heart attack.


213
0:12:48,72 --> 0:12:54,0
Bit young. My cousin's
got one of these.


214
0:12:54,0 --> 0:12:55,96
You don't break
into gangsters' houses.


215
0:12:55,96 --> 0:12:58,6
I think I just worked out
what a kiss might be worth.


216
0:12:58,6 --> 0:13:13,72
A picture of Paddy on your phone.


217
0:13:13,72 --> 0:13:16,32
Letitia!


218
0:13:16,32 --> 0:13:44,12
Wait!


219
0:13:44,12 --> 0:13:45,32
What happened?


220
0:13:45,32 --> 0:13:48,52
You tell me. You fainted.


221
0:13:48,52 --> 0:13:50,28
Oh.


222
0:13:50,28 --> 0:13:56,64
Jamie?


223
0:13:56,64 --> 0:14:1,44
Ah, isn't he funny, Jamie?


224
0:14:1,44 --> 0:14:11,8
Ha-ha-ha!


225
0:14:11,8 --> 0:14:11,8
Oh.


226
0:14:11,8 --> 0:14:13,4
They've sent me under ever since.


227
0:14:13,4 --> 0:14:16,36
And I thought you were
a big, hard, fearless gangster.


228
0:14:16,36 --> 0:14:17,84
This can't get out, Karen.


229
0:14:17,84 --> 0:14:18,6
Course not.


230
0:14:18,6 --> 0:14:21,32
I'm serious. Any sign of weakness
and people pounce.


231
0:14:21,32 --> 0:14:23,64
Tony Soprano went to a shrink.


232
0:14:23,64 --> 0:14:24,52
Karen.


233
0:14:24,52 --> 0:14:40,16
OK. I get it.


234
0:14:40,16 --> 0:14:41,68
Surprise!


235
0:14:41,68 --> 0:14:42,56
Karen! Don't!


236
0:14:42,56 --> 0:14:44,8
Shh. OK. OK.


237
0:14:44,8 --> 0:14:45,72
It'll be OK.


238
0:14:45,72 --> 0:14:47,44
Please!


239
0:14:47,44 --> 0:14:52,68
I promise. It'll be all right.
See?


240
0:14:52,68 --> 0:14:55,12
Just let it go.


241
0:14:55,12 --> 0:14:56,96
Karen, please, I'm fucking
begging you!


242
0:14:56,96 --> 0:15:0,12
Shh. This'll work. Don't be scared.


243
0:15:0,12 --> 0:15:1,88
Come on.


244
0:15:1,88 --> 0:15:4,68
No!


245
0:15:4,68 --> 0:15:10,8
OK.


246
0:15:10,8 --> 0:15:12,4
Are you some kind of pervert?


247
0:15:12,4 --> 0:15:13,56
You owe me.


248
0:15:13,56 --> 0:15:15,68
You didn't even get a photo.


249
0:15:15,68 --> 0:15:20,16
What if I got something better?


250
0:15:20,16 --> 0:15:21,4
Are you stupid?


251
0:15:21,4 --> 0:15:22,6
We could sell it.


252
0:15:22,6 --> 0:15:27,72
We? Leave it out! What if it's...


253
0:15:27,72 --> 0:15:30,68
The trigger's a bit...


254
0:15:30,68 --> 0:15:35,96
What are you doing?
Get away from here.


255
0:15:35,96 --> 0:15:40,6
Outside. Just now. Two shots.


256
0:15:40,6 --> 0:15:50,28
Quickly!


257
0:15:50,28 --> 0:15:54,52
Should never have left Longsight.
You all right?


258
0:15:54,52 --> 0:16:7,88
That's all that matters.


259
0:16:7,88 --> 0:16:10,64
How would I know if anyone
was out to get us?


260
0:16:10,64 --> 0:16:14,96
Could be kids fucking about.
Why would we have enemies?


261
0:16:14,96 --> 0:16:17,56
Just part of the investigation,
Mrs Maguire.


262
0:16:17,56 --> 0:16:27,96
I'd like to know which grass
reported this bullshit, though.


263
0:16:27,96 --> 0:16:30,68
These things dig right into my tits.


264
0:16:30,68 --> 0:16:33,56
Fucking Gunchester.
Give me the Dingle any day.


265
0:16:33,56 --> 0:16:35,48
That was every wrong 'un in town


266
0:16:35,48 --> 0:16:38,64
and nobody's owning up to firing
a gun. Our enemies are lying low.


267
0:16:38,64 --> 0:16:41,24
Right.


268
0:16:41,24 --> 0:16:42,36
Well, go on.


269
0:16:42,36 --> 0:16:42,84
The police.


270
0:16:42,84 --> 0:16:45,2
Ah, now they really are
taking the piss.


271
0:16:45,2 --> 0:16:48,64
Not commiserating for Paddy.
Mental Macca got killed last night.


272
0:16:48,64 --> 0:16:51,4
They haven't got a body, though.


273
0:16:51,4 --> 0:16:54,68
No. But half of his brain's
left splattered on a wall.


274
0:16:54,68 --> 0:17:7,8
How do you know anyway?


275
0:17:7,8 --> 0:17:10,88
He wouldn't take no for an answer.
We had no choice.


276
0:17:10,88 --> 0:17:13,28
Is nothing sacred?


277
0:17:13,28 --> 0:17:14,92
It's an empty coffin!


278
0:17:14,92 --> 0:17:16,64
With your father's name on it!


279
0:17:16,64 --> 0:17:20,4
It was a lot less messy
than chopping Macca up.


280
0:17:20,4 --> 0:17:25,28
The bizzies just said that
whoever killed Mental Macca
is shooting at us.


281
0:17:25,28 --> 0:17:26,36
Why would they say that?


282
0:17:26,36 --> 0:17:29,8
The bullet casings they found
are from the same gun.


283
0:17:29,8 --> 0:17:31,84
Bollocks. They can't be.


284
0:17:31,84 --> 0:17:34,24
Maybe it's their idea of a joke.


285
0:17:34,24 --> 0:17:36,88
Oh, funny. Very fucking funny.


286
0:17:36,88 --> 0:17:41,72
Yeah. Do you want to rearrange?


287
0:17:41,72 --> 0:17:43,2
OK. Bye.


288
0:17:43,2 --> 0:17:45,8
What's up?


289
0:17:45,8 --> 0:17:47,0
Another cancellation.


290
0:17:47,0 --> 0:17:48,56
What's wrong with you?


291
0:17:48,56 --> 0:17:57,64
Nothing.
I just need to check something.


292
0:17:57,64 --> 0:18:3,2
Oh, aye? What have you done
with our daughter?


293
0:18:3,2 --> 0:18:4,4
I paid her off.


294
0:18:4,4 --> 0:18:5,44
You'll teach her bad habits.


295
0:18:5,44 --> 0:18:10,2
She'll need plenty,
if she's to get what she wants.


296
0:18:10,2 --> 0:18:11,6
I know what you want.


297
0:18:11,6 --> 0:18:20,52
Oh!


298
0:18:20,52 --> 0:18:27,16
And the warriors climbed off
the unicorns, and dived into
the crystal pool.


299
0:18:27,16 --> 0:18:30,4
Which made their shorts
go all see-through.


300
0:18:30,4 --> 0:18:39,0
And all the children
lived happily ever after.


301
0:18:39,0 --> 0:18:46,88
What's Mental Macca doing
in there?


302
0:18:46,88 --> 0:18:49,0
Ah, whoa! What have I done?


303
0:18:49,0 --> 0:18:49,64
Where is it?


304
0:18:49,64 --> 0:18:50,48
What?


305
0:18:50,48 --> 0:18:51,72
The gun.


306
0:18:51,72 --> 0:18:53,28
I thought we'd sold them all.


307
0:18:53,28 --> 0:18:55,32
The one with my prints on it.


308
0:18:55,32 --> 0:19:1,72
Ahh!


309
0:19:1,72 --> 0:19:2,84
That Afro was the only reason
you went out with me.


310
0:19:2,84 --> 0:19:4,8
Is that what you reckon?


311
0:19:4,8 --> 0:19:7,96
My comb at an angle.
Tacchini tracksuit.


312
0:19:7,96 --> 0:19:9,92
Break-dancing at West Wythy
with Jason Orange.


313
0:19:9,92 --> 0:19:12,48
I sure picked the right one then.


314
0:19:12,48 --> 0:19:14,48
I could spin on my head
better than him.


315
0:19:14,48 --> 0:19:17,36
Only cos you had more padding.


316
0:19:17,36 --> 0:19:18,4
Round two upstairs?


317
0:19:18,4 --> 0:19:21,4
Mm.


318
0:19:21,4 --> 0:19:58,48
I'll be waiting.


319
0:19:58,48 --> 0:20:13,8
Bye!


320
0:20:13,8 --> 0:20:19,52
I'm delighted the landlord
has seen fit to cater to our needs.


321
0:20:19,52 --> 0:20:23,28
It's about time more people stood up
for what they know to be right.


322
0:20:23,28 --> 0:20:25,44
Three cheers for Patty! Hip-hip!


323
0:20:25,44 --> 0:20:28,4
At least they're spending.


324
0:20:28,4 --> 0:20:32,24
We'll take to the road
and show no mercy for any business


325
0:20:32,24 --> 0:20:35,6
that fails to meet
the basic levels of support


326
0:20:35,6 --> 0:20:45,2
needed by everyone in this
community.


327
0:20:45,2 --> 0:20:46,76
How was it?


328
0:20:46,76 --> 0:20:49,88
Not bad. Come on, over here.


329
0:20:49,88 --> 0:20:52,8
Always knew you were a clown, Micky!


330
0:20:52,8 --> 0:20:57,44
So, who got the best tips?


331
0:20:57,44 --> 0:20:59,72
What happened?


332
0:20:59,72 --> 0:21:11,2
Hoo-hoo!


333
0:21:11,2 --> 0:21:14,32
Who wants to see some magic,
kids? Wanna play?


334
0:21:14,32 --> 0:21:17,24
Ooh. Ha.


335
0:21:17,24 --> 0:21:20,2
Ooh. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Oh!


336
0:21:20,2 --> 0:21:22,28
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Oh!


337
0:21:22,28 --> 0:21:24,36
So, no-one got paid?


338
0:21:24,36 --> 0:21:28,4
I had to pay them. Compo.
But I'll cover it.


339
0:21:28,4 --> 0:21:31,16
Do you know how much this gear costs?


340
0:21:31,16 --> 0:21:32,76
We'll do better next time.


341
0:21:32,76 --> 0:21:34,84
Please, Karen. I love my job.


342
0:21:34,84 --> 0:21:38,92
Me too.


343
0:21:38,92 --> 0:21:42,44
Must be true what they say.
Old Dr Time can heal all wounds.


344
0:21:42,44 --> 0:21:49,8
With the help of a crushed-up Viagra
and a gram of Charlie.


345
0:21:49,8 --> 0:21:51,8
Jamie, get Patty
whatever she wants.


346
0:21:51,8 --> 0:21:55,8
A single malt.


347
0:21:55,8 --> 0:21:57,72
Pint, Mimi.


348
0:21:57,72 --> 0:22:1,52
Your fetid little maggot
back in working order, then?


349
0:22:1,52 --> 0:22:2,52
Y'on about?


350
0:22:2,52 --> 0:22:4,92
Libby's better off
away from such filth.


351
0:22:4,92 --> 0:22:8,4
Lest we forget, your own daughter
fucked off on you as well.


352
0:22:8,4 --> 0:22:13,4
Because you filled her head full
of romance and turned out to be
a gobshite.


353
0:22:13,4 --> 0:22:17,24
Ah. And has she been in touch
with her dear old mum to tell her
how she is?


354
0:22:17,24 --> 0:22:19,68
Treat her to a coffee?


355
0:22:19,68 --> 0:22:30,96
Let her know
where the fuck she's even gone?


356
0:22:30,96 --> 0:22:42,12
Son?


357
0:22:42,12 --> 0:22:43,16
Where is he?


358
0:22:43,16 --> 0:22:44,76
Aidan!


359
0:22:44,76 --> 0:22:47,84
I'm on the radio in a second.


360
0:22:47,84 --> 0:22:49,8
That's nice.


361
0:22:49,8 --> 0:22:52,76
Are you listening to your favourite
great auntie on the wireless?


362
0:22:52,76 --> 0:22:57,0
You're my only great auntie.
Record it for us.


363
0:22:57,0 --> 0:22:58,44
Did you get it back?


364
0:22:58,44 --> 0:23:1,92
It wasn't there
and they're not saying anything.


365
0:23:1,92 --> 0:23:4,28
You two getting it on yet?


366
0:23:4,28 --> 0:23:6,2
I'm on the radio in a minute, Carl.


367
0:23:6,2 --> 0:23:9,16
Yeah, nice one. I need a few Z's.
Had another late one.


368
0:23:9,16 --> 0:23:12,96
'..mathematics and science
in older children.


369
0:23:12,96 --> 0:23:15,68
'The Government's latest drive
to raise standards...'


370
0:23:15,68 --> 0:23:17,88
Aidan! It...


371
0:23:17,88 --> 0:23:21,56
Carl! It's about to start.


372
0:23:21,56 --> 0:23:26,44
'That's all the news.
But now, here's the weather.'


373
0:23:26,44 --> 0:23:29,92
Someone come and just turn it up!


374
0:23:29,92 --> 0:23:35,28
'..sunshine mainly in the afternoon.
Generally southeasterly breeze
with warm temperatures,


375
0:23:35,28 --> 0:23:51,76
'highs of 20 to 22 degrees Celsius.'


376
0:23:51,76 --> 0:23:57,44
'I'm delighted
the landlords have seen sense...


377
0:23:57,44 --> 0:24:2,16
'time more people stood up
for what they know to be right.'


378
0:24:2,16 --> 0:24:3,64
'Three cheers for Patty. Hip-hip!'
'Hooray!


379
0:24:3,64 --> 0:24:5,92
'Hip-hip!'
'Hooray!'


380
0:24:5,92 --> 0:24:22,6
'Hip-hip!'
'Hooray!'


381
0:24:22,6 --> 0:24:26,4
Hey, look, everyone. Here's Patty!


382
0:24:26,4 --> 0:24:31,48
We heard you on the radio, Patty.
Give her what she wants.


383
0:24:31,48 --> 0:24:45,68
Whisky.


384
0:24:45,68 --> 0:24:51,84
Again.


385
0:24:51,84 --> 0:24:53,44
No gratitude
for getting your mates in?


386
0:24:53,44 --> 0:24:56,28
A sheet of plywood and a brick?


387
0:24:56,28 --> 0:24:59,4
I know. Wish I'd have
thought of it earlier.


388
0:24:59,4 --> 0:25:0,28
And again.


389
0:25:0,28 --> 0:25:2,6
Patty! Come and join us.


390
0:25:2,6 --> 0:25:5,16
Yeah, come and have a drink.


391
0:25:5,16 --> 0:25:9,32
Yay! Too right,
you should go and celebrate.


392
0:25:9,32 --> 0:25:11,96
Children of the revolution!


393
0:25:11,96 --> 0:25:14,8
Chorlton nil, wheelies one,
eh, Patty?


394
0:25:14,8 --> 0:25:18,4
No, it's a wonderful day,
my sister of Shankly.


395
0:25:18,4 --> 0:25:23,0
Especially when the drinks
are on those close to you.


396
0:25:23,0 --> 0:25:24,24
Ha-ha-ha.


397
0:25:24,24 --> 0:25:26,64
Well done, Patty.


398
0:25:26,64 --> 0:25:28,28
Well, aren't we popular?


399
0:25:28,28 --> 0:25:30,24
What do you want
to keep your mouth shut?


400
0:25:30,24 --> 0:25:32,48
80/20 on the disability benefit.


401
0:25:32,48 --> 0:25:34,36
No chance.


402
0:25:34,36 --> 0:25:37,48
Huh... Hey, everyone! Come on!


403
0:25:37,48 --> 0:25:39,96
Big cheer for Patty!


404
0:25:39,96 --> 0:25:42,2
Yeah, party, party!


405
0:25:42,2 --> 0:25:43,64
Whoa! Ha-ha!


406
0:25:43,64 --> 0:25:46,4
Ha-ha-ha. Your call.


407
0:25:46,4 --> 0:25:49,88
Ha-ha.


408
0:25:49,88 --> 0:25:52,88
Yeah, come on! Drinks all round!


409
0:25:52,88 --> 0:26:3,48
Wheelies! What's your pleasure?
Come on!


410
0:26:3,48 --> 0:26:4,52
One...


411
0:26:4,52 --> 0:26:7,52
two, three, four...


412
0:26:7,52 --> 0:26:9,44
five... Look at that one!


413
0:26:9,44 --> 0:26:10,8
..six.


414
0:26:10,8 --> 0:26:15,32
Cheeky f...


415
0:26:15,32 --> 0:26:16,96
Oi! Leave it alone!


416
0:26:16,96 --> 0:26:18,32
Chatsworth's my patch.


417
0:26:18,32 --> 0:26:21,48
Yeah? It's a free market.


418
0:26:21,48 --> 0:26:37,48
Fucking...


419
0:26:37,48 --> 0:26:40,12
Come on, lads.
That's got to be worth 50 quid.


420
0:26:40,12 --> 0:26:43,88
Cheers, Tony. Here y'are,
do you wanna leave us your numbers?


421
0:26:43,88 --> 0:26:46,8
We might be able to
get you some business.


422
0:26:46,8 --> 0:26:48,76
That'll come in handy.


423
0:26:48,76 --> 0:26:52,56
No, I'm really sorry. No, I can't
make Cody's birthday party.


424
0:26:52,56 --> 0:26:55,44
It's very important. Sorry.


425
0:26:55,44 --> 0:26:58,12
No word?


426
0:26:58,12 --> 0:27:0,16
Maybe the filth
are playing games with us.


427
0:27:0,16 --> 0:27:1,28
Why would they?


428
0:27:1,28 --> 0:27:2,52
Because that's the sort of bullshit
they pull.


429
0:27:2,52 --> 0:27:5,52
Would the police fire a gun
through your mam's window?


430
0:27:5,52 --> 0:27:7,76
Well, somebody has,
and it's doing my head in.


431
0:27:7,76 --> 0:28:1,64
Silver lining. I am cutting down
on all the clowns around here.


432
0:28:1,64 --> 0:28:7,28
Falling down the stairs the day
before your daughter's wedding?


433
0:28:7,28 --> 0:28:9,24
That's right.


434
0:28:9,24 --> 0:28:10,24
All the way down?


435
0:28:10,24 --> 0:28:12,16
I needed an operation, didn't I?


436
0:28:12,16 --> 0:28:14,12
Impeccable timing.


437
0:28:14,12 --> 0:28:16,0
She was too good for him.


438
0:28:16,0 --> 0:28:20,28
Oh, too good for all of them
if it means leaving you.


439
0:28:20,28 --> 0:28:22,64
180 a week disability
is no lottery win.


440
0:28:22,64 --> 0:28:24,68
Hey, keeps the wolves at bay.


441
0:28:24,68 --> 0:28:27,8
Stop showing off. Drawing attention.


442
0:28:27,8 --> 0:28:31,72
People know
I can't stand the sight of you.


443
0:28:31,72 --> 0:28:35,0
Clean off, mate. Clean off.


444
0:28:35,0 --> 0:28:36,56
No...


445
0:28:36,56 --> 0:28:44,2
All right, boys, grab a plate.
I've made plenty.


446
0:28:44,2 --> 0:28:46,8
Here you go.


447
0:28:46,8 --> 0:28:50,36
And yours, Mimi. I just laid it all
out on a plate, didn't I?


448
0:28:50,36 --> 0:28:53,72
Changed man. Virtually went down
on my knees. And still she went.


449
0:28:53,72 --> 0:28:55,88
She always thought
she was better than she was.


450
0:28:55,88 --> 0:28:57,4
And then she threw it
all back in my face.


451
0:28:57,4 --> 0:29:0,24
I've seen women like her
all my life.


452
0:29:0,24 --> 0:29:2,44
She just wanted respect.


453
0:29:2,44 --> 0:29:5,4
She's taking us to the cleaners,
Frank.


454
0:29:5,4 --> 0:29:7,32
Oh, well,
she's blagged lesser men than you.


455
0:29:7,32 --> 0:29:10,92
Real mover and shaker.
You see where Libby got it from.


456
0:29:10,92 --> 0:29:13,8
Don't badmouth my daughter in public.


457
0:29:13,8 --> 0:29:18,4
The teeniest bit of effort, that's
all she needed to make, Lillian.


458
0:29:18,4 --> 0:29:20,8
Me, me, me.


459
0:29:20,8 --> 0:29:29,16
Why do you really think she left?


460
0:29:29,16 --> 0:29:31,4
You wouldn't have dared.


461
0:29:31,4 --> 0:29:32,96
She wanted to give it another go
with you.


462
0:29:32,96 --> 0:29:39,0
No matter, I begged and reminded her
you're nothing but
a useless piss-pot.


463
0:29:39,0 --> 0:29:41,6
So, you told her
that you could walk?


464
0:29:41,6 --> 0:29:44,4
Maybe I needed to come clean.


465
0:29:44,4 --> 0:29:45,68
Just so she'd fuck off?


466
0:29:45,68 --> 0:29:50,36
Unburden myself of a hateful lie.


467
0:29:50,36 --> 0:29:57,4
And if knowing the truth helped her
to find the strength to move on...


468
0:29:57,4 --> 0:30:3,12
And I've been running after you
like a busy cunt for four months?


469
0:30:3,12 --> 0:30:5,4
Mm.


470
0:30:5,4 --> 0:30:9,8
And for what it's worth,
you'll carry on.


471
0:30:9,8 --> 0:30:13,32
Oh?


472
0:30:13,32 --> 0:30:16,28
Oh.


473
0:30:16,28 --> 0:30:18,64
Er... excuse me! Oi, oi!


474
0:30:18,64 --> 0:30:21,4
Um... fellow Jockeyites! Get on this!


475
0:30:21,4 --> 0:30:24,92
Tss! Fwk! Christ!


476
0:30:24,92 --> 0:30:26,84
Don't do it!


477
0:30:26,84 --> 0:30:30,8
Yeeh!
Is this a blagger I see before me?


478
0:30:30,8 --> 0:30:34,8
Frank.


479
0:30:34,8 --> 0:30:38,72
You taking the piss?


480
0:30:38,72 --> 0:30:42,56
She can, you know.
As and when requested.


481
0:30:42,56 --> 0:30:45,52
Yeah, I saw her! Go on, show 'em.


482
0:30:45,52 --> 0:30:47,32
Rambling madman.


483
0:30:47,32 --> 0:30:48,48
Oh!


484
0:30:48,48 --> 0:30:49,6
What did you see?


485
0:30:49,6 --> 0:30:55,12
What did I...


486
0:30:55,12 --> 0:30:59,72
Ooh, listen to me on t'wireless.


487
0:30:59,72 --> 0:31:2,12
Oh. Tut-tut-tut!


488
0:31:2,12 --> 0:31:3,76
Tut!


489
0:31:3,76 --> 0:31:7,44
Tut-tut-tut! Splat.


490
0:31:7,44 --> 0:31:10,24
Do you enjoy reminding me
I'm a cripple?


491
0:31:10,24 --> 0:31:12,72
Now, now, Patty. Trades description.


492
0:31:12,72 --> 0:31:18,64
That's what I try, try,
every morning.


493
0:31:18,64 --> 0:31:21,16
Because I pray for a miracle
every night.


494
0:31:21,16 --> 0:31:26,24
And one... one time in a thousand,
I get the strength to force myself up


495
0:31:26,24 --> 0:31:32,0
and manage a whole second
suspended on my feet.


496
0:31:32,0 --> 0:31:35,12
Before...


497
0:31:35,12 --> 0:31:38,56
always fall back down again!


498
0:31:38,56 --> 0:31:41,72
Leave her alone, you bully.
She's suffered enough.


499
0:31:41,72 --> 0:31:43,0
Oh, you're good.


500
0:31:43,0 --> 0:31:45,68
Come here, you fucking fraud.


501
0:31:45,68 --> 0:31:48,84
Frank! Careful!


502
0:31:48,84 --> 0:31:50,36
No!


503
0:31:50,36 --> 0:31:52,24
No wonder fucking Libby left.


504
0:31:52,24 --> 0:31:53,32
That's enough!


505
0:31:53,32 --> 0:31:56,88
OK. OK, OK. Right, OK.


506
0:31:56,88 --> 0:31:58,64
Whoa!


507
0:31:58,64 --> 0:32:2,6
Frank! I'm warning you!


508
0:32:2,6 --> 0:32:7,72
You lying, twisted,
piss-stained old fraud!


509
0:32:7,72 --> 0:32:12,6
You soft-arsed bone-idle tramp.
Libby's gone for good!


510
0:32:12,6 --> 0:32:13,52
Frank, come on!


511
0:32:13,52 --> 0:32:15,36
Aah!


512
0:32:15,36 --> 0:32:16,44
Fuck!


513
0:32:16,44 --> 0:32:18,8
Help!


514
0:32:18,8 --> 0:32:22,44
See! See! She can feel it.
I told you!


515
0:32:22,44 --> 0:32:27,96
Whoa!


516
0:32:27,96 --> 0:32:31,12
Leave her alone!


517
0:32:31,12 --> 0:32:32,56
Oh!


518
0:32:32,56 --> 0:32:34,36
Oh, my God.


519
0:32:34,36 --> 0:32:35,56
Oh!


520
0:32:35,56 --> 0:32:37,8
Here, he's right.


521
0:32:37,8 --> 0:32:41,44
You...


522
0:32:41,44 --> 0:32:42,44
Oh!


523
0:32:42,44 --> 0:32:43,96
She can walk.


524
0:32:43,96 --> 0:32:46,4
Hallelujah!


525
0:32:46,4 --> 0:32:51,52
Oh, for fuck's sake.


526
0:32:51,52 --> 0:32:54,64
How braindead can you get?


527
0:32:54,64 --> 0:33:0,88
Hope it was worth it.


528
0:33:0,88 --> 0:33:4,4
So, what about Micky and Lillian?


529
0:33:4,4 --> 0:33:7,12
I haven't got the bookings
and this stuff costs a bomb to hire.


530
0:33:7,12 --> 0:33:9,4
It wasn't cos I was smoking weed?


531
0:33:9,4 --> 0:33:17,92
I'm just not ready to expand.


532
0:33:17,92 --> 0:33:24,68
Whatever it is, don't do it.


533
0:33:24,68 --> 0:33:27,6
I know she knows
I know they've got it.


534
0:33:27,6 --> 0:33:29,76
Maybe they haven't.
Maybe it fell through a hole.


535
0:33:29,76 --> 0:33:31,24
Like I wouldn't have felt it.


536
0:33:31,24 --> 0:33:35,28
A hole in the floor?


537
0:33:35,28 --> 0:33:36,32
What are you doing?


538
0:33:36,32 --> 0:33:37,4
You still owe me a kiss.


539
0:33:37,4 --> 0:33:42,4
You owe me a photo.


540
0:33:42,4 --> 0:33:43,8
When did you get that?


541
0:33:43,8 --> 0:33:45,8
Last night.
Well, send it me, then.


542
0:33:45,8 --> 0:33:48,28
Kiss first.


543
0:33:48,28 --> 0:33:52,84
Standing.


544
0:33:52,84 --> 0:33:54,8
Look, I've told you.
Kelly hates guns.


545
0:33:54,8 --> 0:33:57,52
All I'm saying is she's capable.
She lies for a living.


546
0:33:57,52 --> 0:33:58,56
What's that supposed to mean?


547
0:33:58,56 --> 0:34:0,56
She tells nonces
she loves them all day long.


548
0:34:0,56 --> 0:34:1,6
Karen's no angel.


549
0:34:1,6 --> 0:34:2,6
Well, go on.


550
0:34:2,6 --> 0:34:5,12
She knew you were selling guns too,
you know.


551
0:34:5,12 --> 0:34:7,24
Hey, she never even
goes round there.


552
0:34:7,24 --> 0:34:9,88
I know for a fact
Kelly did not take that gun.


553
0:34:9,88 --> 0:34:11,88
By my reckoning,
that only leaves you.


554
0:34:11,88 --> 0:34:17,2
Whoa!


555
0:34:17,2 --> 0:34:19,68
You gonna give your new boyfriend
a kiss?


556
0:34:19,68 --> 0:34:20,48
Get off me!


557
0:34:20,48 --> 0:34:22,2
Again. Where's the gun?


558
0:34:22,2 --> 0:34:23,72
I don't know what you mean!


559
0:34:23,72 --> 0:34:30,68
Look what we do to people.
Do you think we give a fuck
if you go in the groundas well?


560
0:34:30,68 --> 0:34:35,56
Have it your way.


561
0:34:35,56 --> 0:34:37,0
No! No, stop it!


562
0:34:37,0 --> 0:34:44,16
Stop! I took it home.


563
0:34:44,16 --> 0:34:47,8
You. You better hope
they haven't sold it.


564
0:34:47,8 --> 0:34:52,44
Check upstairs.


565
0:34:52,44 --> 0:35:2,52
Who's a lucky boy, then?


566
0:35:2,52 --> 0:35:5,52
Aah.


567
0:35:5,52 --> 0:35:11,2
So, you wanna play with fire,
do you?


568
0:35:11,2 --> 0:35:47,16
No!


569
0:35:47,16 --> 0:35:48,88
No! No!


570
0:35:48,88 --> 0:35:57,32
Oh! Oh!


571
0:35:57,32 --> 0:35:58,76
Oh!


572
0:35:58,76 --> 0:36:13,24
Get'em off!


573
0:36:13,24 --> 0:36:17,68
More! More! More!


574
0:36:17,68 --> 0:36:19,72
We've already done half an hour over.


575
0:36:19,72 --> 0:36:20,28
That's all you're getting! Get off!


576
0:36:20,28 --> 0:36:22,44
Get 'em off!


577
0:36:22,44 --> 0:36:23,84
Nobody said anything about this.


578
0:36:23,84 --> 0:36:25,8
Like you didn't know!


579
0:36:25,8 --> 0:36:26,84
Karen!
This party's over.


580
0:36:26,84 --> 0:36:30,2
Get the door.


581
0:36:30,2 --> 0:36:31,8
You're not going anywhere.


582
0:36:31,8 --> 0:36:36,4
Bit of a prick teaser, are we?


583
0:36:36,4 --> 0:36:45,56
Get it out for the lads. Yes.


584
0:36:45,56 --> 0:36:48,12
Hey, hey, hey, give us that!
It's his treat.


585
0:36:48,12 --> 0:36:50,64
Let him fuck you!


586
0:36:50,64 --> 0:36:52,8
Karen!


587
0:36:52,8 --> 0:36:55,88
Come on,
most strippers do a bit more, yeah!


588
0:36:55,88 --> 0:36:57,96
Do you know who I am?


589
0:36:57,96 --> 0:37:1,52
Some potless dirty bitch?


590
0:37:1,52 --> 0:37:3,16
Karen Maguire.


591
0:37:3,16 --> 0:37:12,8
Wit woo.


592
0:37:12,8 --> 0:37:15,4
Whoa! That's a big one.
Where's that going?


593
0:37:15,4 --> 0:37:24,52
Up your fucking ring piece,
if you're not careful!


594
0:37:24,52 --> 0:37:26,2
What did you do that for?


595
0:37:26,2 --> 0:37:29,0
Hit him as well!


596
0:37:29,0 --> 0:37:29,76
Get off.


597
0:37:29,76 --> 0:37:31,56
That's a heavy water pistol.


598
0:37:31,56 --> 0:37:33,92
You reckon?


599
0:37:33,92 --> 0:37:37,4
Ah! My leg!


600
0:37:37,4 --> 0:37:51,52
That's what you get,
you fucking cunts!


601
0:37:51,52 --> 0:38:25,88
Karen?


602
0:38:25,88 --> 0:38:28,52
Karen?


603
0:38:28,52 --> 0:38:30,32
You OK?


604
0:38:30,32 --> 0:38:33,52
What happened?


605
0:38:33,52 --> 0:38:34,64
It's all right.


606
0:38:34,64 --> 0:38:36,92
Come on, tell me.


607
0:38:36,92 --> 0:38:56,52
Just come here.


608
0:38:56,52 --> 0:39:0,64
Dad always said you were at it.


609
0:39:0,64 --> 0:39:4,56
What's up with you?


610
0:39:4,56 --> 0:39:7,24
Don't you dare waste that!


611
0:39:7,24 --> 0:39:8,56
Think you can fix things
with a full English?


612
0:39:8,56 --> 0:39:13,64
He's not been right for days.


613
0:39:13,64 --> 0:39:18,2
Hey, don't...


614
0:39:18,2 --> 0:39:23,44
OK, I'll take 50-50
on the disability benefits.


615
0:39:23,44 --> 0:39:26,56
You've got nothing on me any more.


616
0:39:26,56 --> 0:39:28,24
You sure about that?


617
0:39:28,24 --> 0:39:32,88
No chance.


618
0:39:32,88 --> 0:39:36,4
Well, grassing never sits easy.


619
0:39:36,4 --> 0:39:40,8
But DSS, like pit bulls,
get a sniff of blood.


620
0:39:40,8 --> 0:39:43,96
20 years of false claims?


621
0:39:43,96 --> 0:39:46,68
They are going to want a big chat.


622
0:39:46,68 --> 0:39:51,16
I'd say half each seems fair.


623
0:39:51,16 --> 0:39:53,32
Keep your pathetic threats, Frank.


624
0:39:53,32 --> 0:40:0,4
Someone's beaten you to it.


625
0:40:0,4 --> 0:40:4,2
Time to pack your bags.


626
0:40:4,2 --> 0:40:7,28
You looking at,
you fat, lazy bastard?


627
0:40:7,28 --> 0:40:9,44
You wouldn't be in here
if it wasn't for me.


628
0:40:9,44 --> 0:40:10,72
She's full of shit, her!


629
0:40:10,72 --> 0:40:12,6
Like I don't know it.


630
0:40:12,6 --> 0:40:14,36
Who backed her trip to Lourdes?


631
0:40:14,36 --> 0:40:19,72
Bottom line, it's down to
her you're even in here.


632
0:40:19,72 --> 0:40:21,4
Oh!


633
0:40:21,4 --> 0:40:24,48
The kid from Cincinnati, he say yes!


634
0:40:24,48 --> 0:40:29,28
Heh-heh-hey-hey! Who'd Adam and Eve
it, eh? The luck of the Irish.


635
0:40:29,28 --> 0:40:30,68
Burn the slag.


636
0:40:30,68 --> 0:40:33,96
I said leave it!


637
0:40:33,96 --> 0:40:36,88
O blest Lord, Creator God...


638
0:40:36,88 --> 0:40:43,24
in you all things
are rendered pure...


639
0:40:43,24 --> 0:40:45,72
by you are strengthened to endure.


640
0:40:45,72 --> 0:40:48,2
O blest holy hand of God,


641
0:40:48,2 --> 0:40:50,88
all things are sanctified by you...


642
0:40:50,88 --> 0:40:53,6
adorned, enriched,
you make them new.


643
0:40:53,6 --> 0:41:17,96
I'm at a funeral.


644
0:41:17,96 --> 0:41:19,92
Go on, Patty!


645
0:41:19,92 --> 0:41:24,2
Go on, girl!


646
0:41:24,2 --> 0:41:52,12
Go on, Patty!


647
0:41:52,12 --> 0:41:57,72
Squaw Valley, California, 1960.


648
0:41:57,72 --> 0:42:5,0
I was to be the first Irish
winter ice-dancing Olympian.


649
0:42:5,0 --> 0:42:6,88
Then I got pregnant with Libby.


650
0:42:6,88 --> 0:42:11,8
What, at 15? Fucking...
Welcome to your spiritual home.


651
0:42:11,8 --> 0:42:13,92
My country.


652
0:42:13,92 --> 0:42:16,76
The Olympics.


653
0:42:16,76 --> 0:42:18,72
Oh, imagine.


654
0:42:18,72 --> 0:42:21,56
And because you didn't get
to fuck about on ice skates


655
0:42:21,56 --> 0:42:23,68
it's all right to steal
your daughter's life?


656
0:42:23,68 --> 0:42:27,0
What was your excuse,
you useless parasite?


657
0:42:27,0 --> 0:42:30,2
Oh, well, yeah, you got me.
Guilty as charged.


658
0:42:30,2 --> 0:42:31,6
I stole Libby's heart,


659
0:42:31,6 --> 0:42:42,28
but you know when you're like that,
colours are brighter,
birdsong's clearer.


660
0:42:42,28 --> 0:42:45,44
Until the novelty fades away


661
0:42:45,44 --> 0:42:49,64
and I'm back in the arms
of the only constant.


662
0:42:49,64 --> 0:42:52,52
My only true love.


663
0:42:52,52 --> 0:42:57,28
Am I a lesser man?


664
0:42:57,28 --> 0:42:59,8
This mother-child thing?


665
0:42:59,8 --> 0:43:4,48
Whoosh! Nurture, shelter, protect.


666
0:43:4,48 --> 0:43:8,28
That's instinct, yeah?


667
0:43:8,28 --> 0:43:10,64
It's instinct. Natural.


668
0:43:10,64 --> 0:43:18,6
Then, with love and prayers,
you set them free.


669
0:43:18,6 --> 0:43:20,28
Too right.


670
0:43:20,28 --> 0:43:24,36
Amen.


671
0:43:24,36 --> 0:43:28,12
Just a thought.


672
0:43:28,12 --> 0:43:30,64
I'd booked a termination.


673
0:43:30,64 --> 0:43:33,24
At an underground clinic
in Liverpool.


674
0:43:33,24 --> 0:43:35,8
Oh, fuck off.


675
0:43:35,8 --> 0:43:37,24
Abortion was still illegal.


676
0:43:37,24 --> 0:43:40,48
Now you need to button it.


677
0:43:40,48 --> 0:43:44,8
But the worst storm in a decade
stopped the ferries for a week.


678
0:43:44,8 --> 0:43:49,88
Daddy found out, locked me
in my room for a month.


679
0:43:49,88 --> 0:43:54,44
I wanted to get rid of her then...


680
0:43:54,44 --> 0:43:58,48
and I don't need her now.


681
0:43:58,48 --> 0:44:3,36
Well, I hope it was worth it.


682
0:44:3,36 --> 0:44:20,0
I don't need anybody.


683
0:44:20,0 --> 0:44:24,84
'At what point does
withholding the truth become a lie?


684
0:44:24,84 --> 0:44:29,32
'I bet politicians are given books
to guide them on that.


685
0:44:29,32 --> 0:44:35,24
'At what point in the lie you've just
created is it too late to back out


686
0:44:35,24 --> 0:44:39,68
'and telling the truth
would do more damage?


687
0:44:39,68 --> 0:44:41,24
'When you have to keep it going


688
0:44:41,24 --> 0:44:46,44
'because you know that even if you
manage to keep that lie going
forever,


689
0:44:46,44 --> 0:44:55,96
'it will eat you up so much inside
you won't want to live anyway.'


690
0:44:55,96 --> 0:44:58,88
Home deliveries. Good idea. I've got
a bit of stock needs shifting.


691
0:44:58,88 --> 0:45:0,76
I don't want to get involved
in any illegal shit.


692
0:45:0,76 --> 0:45:3,0
Let your driver take the flack.


693
0:45:3,0 --> 0:45:4,52
Not over, is it?
Between you and the running man?


694
0:45:4,52 --> 0:45:6,44
We've been acting out our fantasies.


695
0:45:6,44 --> 0:45:8,4
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.


696
0:45:8,4 --> 0:45:10,8
Mm.


697
0:45:10,8 --> 0:45:12,48
Like butter wouldn't melt.
Police just pulled me.


698
0:45:12,48 --> 0:45:15,4
Luckily, I hid that lot
somewhere else.


699
0:45:15,4 --> 0:45:17,4
Avril, we need to talk.


700
0:45:17,4 --> 0:45:19,16
You arrogant piece of shit!


701
0:45:19,16 --> 0:45:20,6
Morning!
Hiya!


702
0:45:20,6 --> 0:45:21,88
Ring the police, Ches.


703
0:45:21,88 --> 0:45:24,8
Tell them about your paedo tendencies
while you're at it.


704
0:45:24,8 --> 0:45:25,64
D'you want some sex?


705
0:45:25,64 --> 0:45:29,84
You were seen kissing her.


706
0:45:29,84 --> 0:45:32,76
I knows my place, master.


707
0:45:32,76 --> 0:45:34,725
Aah!


708
0:45:34,725 --> 0:47:34,725
