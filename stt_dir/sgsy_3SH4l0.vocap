###4 JOHNNY KNOXVILLE: Hello.
###5 We're going to see my friend Mat Hoffman right now.
###9 And if you don't know who he is, Mat is--
###13 he's like the Evel Knievel of our time-- not "like," "is."
###17 And me, Jeff, and Spike just did a documentary on him.
###23 Tremaine was actually the director, me
###25 and Spike, mere producers.
###28 Anyway, the documentary is called The Birth of Big Air.
###30 And we made the movie because Mat is awesome.
###36 TONY HAWK: If you know anything about BMX, you know
###37 who Mat Hoffman is.
###40 And maybe that's all you know.
###42 [PUNK MUSIC]
###52 SPIKE JONZE: There is this point where it feels like
###55 everything's been done.
###56 And then somebody does something else, and it opens
###58 up a whole new realm of possibilities.
###60 And Mat's probably done that a dozen times.
###64 MAT HOFFMAN: Is that really possible, or am I just
###66 completely an idiot?
###67 MALE SPEAKER 1: Mat's holding on one-handed down this
###69 rickety-ass plywood runway.
###72 MALE SPEAKER 2: You could crash and kill yourself just
###74 on the run-up to the ramp.
###76 SPIKE JONZE: He's like that big, and there's that
###78 much air under him.
###79 The ramp's that big.
###81 MAT HOFFMAN: And whether I hold it, or skip to the
###84 ground, that moment was everything.
###89 MALE SPEAKER 3: Three years after Mat tore down his last
###91 big ramp, X Games added MegaRamp and made it the
###94 centerpiece of the event.
###96 MALE SPEAKER 4: You watch the X Games today, and you've got
###97 guys risking their lives on these huge ramps.
###99 And Mat was definitely the guy who started ratcheting it up
###103 to where it got to today.
###104 
###106 TONY HAWK: He was the first guy to do any
###108 sort of big ramp stuff.
###108 And now we've got the whole Big Air event in the X Games.
###111 And that's largely because of Mat ever trying it, or ever
###115 dreaming it.
###117 JOHNNY KNOXVILLE: Today's a little nerve-wracking because
###119 a couple years ago, Mat almost lost his right arm.
###123 He was in a big wreck.
###125 A semi hit him.
###126 So he hasn't ridden anything big for two years, and the
###130 doctors told him he would never ride again.
###133 And today he's riding a very gnarly bowl.
###139 People say, oh, I love that so much I'd give my
###143 right arm for it.
###144 Mat could do that today.
###146 I don't know, I'm just a little nervous.
###152 MAT HOFFMAN: I have no idea what I'm--
###154 this is like a new beginning, this is like a first
###157 challenge, of like--
###158 I've never ridden a ramp like this.
###160 I have whole new equipment.
###162 My arm has got totally new limits.
###166 It's been a long kind of ride that I've
###168 been doing with this--
###169 
###173 Thanks, PJ, man.
###174 JOHNNY KNOXVILLE: Man, he's a foul-mouthed little prick.
###175 He cussed me the whole way up here for
###177 leaving him in the car.
###178 I said, Yoda, I am a Baptist, and my ears
###181 aren't garbage cans.
###183 So I'll put him over here.
###186 MAT HOFFMAN: I really believed that my arm wasn't going to
###188 work, and that I had totally new limits, but they were
###191 limits that--
###194 pain tolerance-- couldn't really ignore, because it just
###197 didn't work anymore.
###199 The power of a semi truck hitting you at 50 miles an
###202 hour is just ridiculous.
###203 And so I've just lost these muscles that control this arm.
###206 If you can kind of see my collarbone, how that just
###209 moves around, it's not even attached to anything.
###210 I've gone through here.
###211 I've gone through this one twice.
###212 And I've gone through this one.
###214 And I've been looking at my bike-- how am I going to
###216 figure this out again, how am I going to play?
###217 I started looking at my body like, more as--
###219 JOHNNY KNOXVILLE: A bicycle part, like Spike said.
###222 MAT HOFFMAN: And doctors are like carpenters.
###223 After you get hurt enough, you just start seeing your--
###227 you're just a piece of--
###229 your body's a part of your bike.
###231 It's all one piece of equipment.
###232 We're trying to keep going.
###234 JOHNNY KNOXVILLE: I don't think most people
###235 look at it that way.
###237 MAT HOFFMAN: And really, what people don't understand is I'm
###239 happy either way.
###242 I'm happy waking up on the flat bar, as happy as I am
###244 airing out.
###244 Because it's just like--
###246 I'm just going for it.
###248 JOHNNY KNOXVILLE: You had a bunch of surgeries on you
###249 before the wreck, right?
###251 MAT HOFFMAN: Yeah, I've had 25 something surgeries.
###254 JOHNNY KNOXVILLE: He's held together by pins,
###255 rods, and duct tape.
###257 MAT HOFFMAN: I owe my life to medical science, really.
###259 
###262 JOHNNY KNOXVILLE: He's a very nerve-wracking friend to have.
###264 [PUNK MUSIC]
###275 SIMON TABRON: That's pure, encapsulated
###276 passion right there.
###278 In England, we call it reckless abandon.
###279 It's a beautiful thing.
###281 Oh my god.
###283 Sorry, he just did something scary.
###285 That's all he does.
###287 Jesus.
###289 JOHNNY KNOXVILLE: He can't even shake someone's hand
###291 without holding his right forearm, so you don't pull his
###293 right shoulder out of socket, and he's out here doing that.
###297 [PUNK MUSIC]
###302 JOHNNY KNOXVILLE: Mat's got one arm, no brakes, defying
###307 all odds by riding again.
###310 What am I doing?
###311 Just lugging beer up the hill.
###313 [MUSIC CONTINUES]
###325 JOHNNY KNOXVILLE: He loves it.
###326 He loves riding.
###327 The doctor told him, you cannot do that,
###329 you won't ride again.
###331 
###335 I'm Mat's personal assistant today.
###338 I'm his driver.
###340 Actually, I'm not driving I'm moral support.
###349 MAT HOFFMAN: This is a story that I never thought I was
###351 going to tell.
###352 So whenever I got this opportunity to do this with
###355 Spike and Jeff and PJ and those people that kind of grew
###358 up with this spirit and this fire, like, being able to tell
###361 the story through them, it's really all of our story.
###365 What it's all about is just going for it, you know.
###368 The way I like to play, and the same with you--
###371 not many people like to live that way.
###373 They just like to be like, OK wait, are your sure this--
###377 let me see some track record.
###379 It's like, where are you going in life?
###380 You're just following what's already been done.
###382 When it comes down to it, to go for it, that untalented--
###387 JOHNNY KNOXVILLE: To be that untal--
###389 I take untalented to a whole new level.
###390 Thank you, Mat.
###391 Jeez, I thought he was going to give me some props on this.
###394 MAT HOFFMAN: To be that untalented, but then still go
###396 for it, that's that spirit that anybody should have.
###402 I wish I had that because--
###403 JOHNNY KNOXVILLE: Thank you?
###405 MAT HOFFMAN: Totally.
###406 He knows he can't do this, because after watching him go
###408 for this multiple times, I now know he can't do this.
###411 It's not acting.
###412 But he's still going to go for it because he can't help it.
###417 He just goes for it.
###418 He likes to go for it.
###419 There's a great saying in Bolt.
###420 I think it was like, in order to make the impossible become
###423 possible, you must be awesome.
###426 JOHNNY KNOXVILLE: Why didn't I think of that?
###427 I've just been being a douche.
###429 I could be awesome, and things would totally change.
###433 MAT HOFFMAN: My favorite thing is being as high as I can be,
###436 and getting the best view.
###438 And seeing all this spectacular landscape.
###442 I want to be up in there and looking down on it.
###445 [PUNK MUSIC]
###452 [LIGHT APPLAUSE]
###456 MAT HOFFMAN: I'm sorry.
###457 
###466 JOHNNY KNOXVILLE: He said, one more, I'm not going to try
###468 nothing hard or anything.
###470 I'm like, OK.
###472 Knowing he was going to--
###476 that was awesome.
###477 
###480 SIMON TABRON: I'm sorry I made your friend do craziness.
###484 In the skateboard pool.
###487 [LAUGHTER]
###489 JOHNNY KNOXVILLE: You can't high five that arm.
###492 The other one you can high five.
###493
