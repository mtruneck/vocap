CHARLENE: Welcome to "Fashion
Week International," the show


3
0:0:8,0 --> 0:0:10,816
that reports on the most
fabulous fashion weeks in the


4
0:0:10,816 --> 0:0:14,21
world, and the culture and
politics behind them.


5
0:0:14,21 --> 0:0:17,17
This time we're in Kingston,
Jamaica, for

0:0:46,62 --> 0:0:50,2
CHARLENE: In June 2012,
Caribbean Fashion Week


11
0:0:50,2 --> 0:0:52,76
descended on Kingston,
Jamaica.


12
0:0:52,76 --> 0:0:55,98
Although Jamaica might not be
known for catwalk couture,


13
0:0:55,98 --> 0:0:57,54
reggae and dancehall style have


14
0:0:57,54 --> 0:1:2,256
become a worldwide export.

0:1:2,256 --> 0:1:5,9
CHARLENE: Whilst dancehall
parties are probably the best


16
0:1:5,9 --> 0:1:7,86
parties in the world, they're
also the place where you'll


17
0:1:7,86 --> 0:1:10,14
find some unusual
beauty trends,


18
0:1:10,14 --> 0:1:12,5
including skin bleaching.

0:1:58,35 --> 0:2:0,22
CHARLENE: Caribbean Fashion Week
has been running for the


27
0:2:0,22 --> 0:2:4,21
last 12 years, mainly without a
hitch, with the exception of


28
0:2:4,21 --> 0:2:7,5
2010 when the whole event had
to be to postponed due to a


29
0:2:7,5 --> 0:2:11,7
small war being fought between
the army and local hero/drug


30
0:2:11,7 --> 0:2:13,26
lord, Dudus Coke.


31
0:2:13,26 --> 0:2:15,76



32
0:2:15,76 --> 0:2:18,28
This year's fashion week was
going ahead without a drugs


33
0:2:18,28 --> 0:2:23,56
war in sight at the National
Sports Center in New Kingston.


34
0:2:23,56 --> 0:2:26,47
The problem with sports centers,
is that no matter how


35
0:2:26,47 --> 0:2:30,25
much hotel furniture and DHL
fashions stalls you set up,


36
0:2:30,25 --> 0:2:34,46
it's always going to look
like a sports center.


37
0:2:34,46 --> 0:2:37,51
Once the show is actually
started, the gorgeous models


38
0:2:37,51 --> 0:2:40,47
definitely had their own way
of working the runway to an


39
0:2:40,47 --> 0:2:44,58
eclectic soundtrack of Skrillex
and Bob Marley.


40
0:2:44,58 --> 0:2:47,62
However, it wasn't until the
fashion stopped and the


41
0:2:47,62 --> 0:2:49,46
after-show entertainment
began that the


42
0:2:49,46 --> 0:2:50,96
catwalk really blew up.

Conscious took to the catwalk,
the previously prim girls on


47
0:3:5,33 --> 0:3:8,78
the front row summarily
transformed into insatiable


48
0:3:8,78 --> 0:3:11,49
dancehall queens.


49
0:3:11,49 --> 0:3:15,41
In Kingston, dancehall nightlife
is omnipotent.


50
0:3:15,41 --> 0:3:18,59
You can rave every night of
the week if you want at


51
0:3:18,59 --> 0:3:23,22
imaginatively named parties such
as Mojito Monday, Nipples


52
0:3:23,22 --> 0:3:28,5
Tuesday, Weddy Weddy Wednesday,
and so on.


53
0:3:28,5 --> 0:3:31,1
To find out more, we were going
to meet a man who, to


54
0:3:31,1 --> 0:3:33,67
describe as an authority on
the subject of dancehall,


55
0:3:33,67 --> 0:3:36,28
would be an understatement.


56
0:3:36,28 --> 0:3:39,23
We just spontaneously were told
we had an interview with


57
0:3:39,23 --> 0:3:40,142
Elephant Man.


58
0:3:40,142 --> 0:3:42,4
And I was like, yeah, cool.


59
0:3:42,4 --> 0:3:43,22
Let's do it.


60
0:3:43,22 --> 0:3:46,97
And then when we walked in and
I met him and I shook his


61
0:3:46,97 --> 0:3:51,26
hand, I became completely
overwhelmed and I dissolved.


62
0:3:51,26 --> 0:3:53,16

like skin bleaching?

0:5:1,4 --> 0:5:20,51



70
0:5:20,51 --> 0:5:23,91
CHARLENE: What for you is the
essence of Jamaican beauty?

0:6:19,65 --> 0:6:22,53
CHARLENE: Back at the party, it
was easy to see why some of


75
0:6:22,53 --> 0:6:25,84
these girls might cause
the men some problems.


76
0:6:25,84 --> 0:6:27,95
Their outfits made their
bodies pop in


77
0:6:27,95 --> 0:6:29,65
all the right places.


78
0:6:29,65 --> 0:6:33,43
However, it was hard to ignore
an unnatural paleness on some


79
0:6:33,43 --> 0:6:34,68
of their faces.


80
0:6:34,68 --> 0:6:36,65

Skin bleaching is a
controversial topic


82
0:6:38,95 --> 0:6:40,58
all over the world.


83
0:6:40,58 --> 0:6:42,97
But Jamaica is the only country
where it has become a


84
0:6:42,97 --> 0:6:46,64
subject immortalized in song
with popular dancehall stars


85
0:6:46,64 --> 0:6:49,308
such as Vybz Kartel
endorsing it.


86
0:6:49,308 --> 0:7:6,26

91
0:7:32,17 --> 0:7:33,23
someone's backyard.


92
0:7:33,23 --> 0:7:34,866
A poultry farmer.


93
0:7:34,866 --> 0:7:38,68
Now, this is obviously not
entirely fashion-related, but


94
0:7:38,68 --> 0:7:40,635
you'll see.


95
0:7:40,635 --> 0:7:43,49
Hi.


96
0:7:43,49 --> 0:7:46,5
We were here to find out about
an underground trend that


97
0:7:46,5 --> 0:7:49,81
started in Jamaica in the
'90s of girls consuming


98
0:7:49,81 --> 0:7:52,32
agricultural chicken
feed in the hope of


99
0:7:52,32 --> 0:7:53,74
obtaining curvier bodies.


100
0:7:53,74 --> 0:7:56,49



101
0:7:56,49 --> 0:7:59,37
Colloquially known as fowl
pills, they might contain


102
0:7:59,37 --> 0:8:2,49
anything from growth hormones
to appetite stimulants.


103
0:8:2,49 --> 0:8:5,45
And one of the key ingredients
is arsenic.


104
0:8:5,45 --> 0:8:6,7
Yummy.

107
0:8:10,7 --> 0:8:27,957

up as KFC, my friend.

110
0:8:33,36 --> 0:8:48,7



111
0:8:48,7 --> 0:8:52,67
CHARLENE: So girls put this
in their porridge?


112
0:8:52,67 --> 0:8:54,8
CHARLENE: And it helps them get


113
0:8:54,8 --> 0:8:55,4
bigger, just like a chicken?


114
0:8:55,4 --> 0:8:59,511



115
0:8:59,511 --> 0:9:1,8
CHARLENE: As this is an
underground phenomenon,


116
0:9:1,8 --> 0:9:4,79
there's no actual proof that
this plumps girls' breasts and


117
0:9:4,79 --> 0:9:8,7
buttocks the way it
does chickens.

I've been here, one of the

0:11:29,35 --> 0:11:30,28
the street.


137

But if eating chicken pill
porridge for breakfast was one


138
0:11:32,95 --> 0:11:37,21
of them, then it's probably
best left on the street.

0:11:37,21 --> 0:11:39,62
I wanted to ask the models what
they thought of these

heard of them.

CHARLENE: General opinion seemed
to suggest that this


145
0:12:57,1 --> 0:13:0,67
was a matter of economics and
education, as these practices


146
0:13:0,67 --> 0:13:3,58
are popular in low-income
areas.

My questioning was eventually
overwhelmed by the

so we left fashion week and

initially seem intimidating,

0:18:9,91 --> 0:18:12,64
CHARLENE: I mean, for some young
girls I think because


212
0:18:12,64 --> 0:18:18,0
the processes is not monitored,
you can't go and


213
0:18:18,0 --> 0:18:21,17
safely buy the cream and there's
no real instructions


214
0:18:21,17 --> 0:18:24,2
because there's no education
around it, do you think it


215
0:18:24,2 --> 0:18:28,95
would be better if there was--


216
0:18:28,95 --> 0:18:32,13
somewhere it was more
regulated so that--

uncomfortable

0:18:49,23 --> 0:18:51,62
with the term, bleaching.


222
0:18:51,62 --> 0:18:54,54
Many people here prefer to
sugar coat the trend by


223
0:18:54,54 --> 0:18:59,3
referring to it as rubbings or
toning the skin, making it


224
0:18:59,3 --> 0:19:3,263
sound more like a health
treatment at a beauty spa.

someone who grew up in the

there, I wanted to talk to

0:19:21,33 --> 0:19:23,96
some young girls from there for
whom the bleaching trend


230
0:19:23,96 --> 0:19:25,47
is a part of everyday life.


231
0:19:25,47 --> 0:19:30,7

It's dangerous for
your health?

CHARLENE: Do you think, also,
the popularity of having

The pills they showed me had
Peritol stamped on them.

0:20:59,21 --> 0:21:2,1
These have nothing to
do with chickens.


255
0:21:2,1 --> 0:21:4,47
Peritol is actually an appetite
stimulant for

0:21:4,47 --> 0:21:6,64
depressed cats.


257
0:21:6,64 --> 0:21:9,86

it'll bring them closer

0:22:25,745 --> 0:22:28,91
CHARLENE: The girls then took
us into downtown Kingston so


268
0:22:28,91 --> 0:22:31,9
we could see just how easy
it was to get hold


269
0:22:31,9 --> 0:22:33,5

0:23:9,34 --> 0:23:21,48

CHARLENE: Because it's kind
of a bit illegal.

0:23:24,31 --> 0:23:27,18
You can't just go and ask the
doctor what to do, you have to

does it work?

289
0:23:52,91 --> 0:23:55,65
CHARLENE: So we just kind of
followed the girls into the


290
0:23:55,65 --> 0:23:58,22
place where they buy the
bleaching cream, and I was


291
0:23:58,22 --> 0:24:0,59
quite surprised to see it all
on display because from what


292
0:24:0,59 --> 0:24:3,29
I've heard, I thought it
was kind of more of an


293
0:24:3,29 --> 0:24:5,27
under-the-counter thing because
it's not legal.


294
0:24:5,27 --> 0:24:8,452
So we were OK for a while and
then once the people who


295
0:24:8,452 --> 0:24:10,84
worked there realized that we
were filming, they asked us to


296
0:24:10,84 --> 0:24:14,242
stop because they thought we
were going to expose them.


297
0:24:14,242 --> 0:24:18,26
So we've had to step outside.

vendor of lightening products

0:24:26,73 --> 0:24:30,62
who agreed to talk
to me about it.


301
0:24:30,62 --> 0:24:33,56
Generally, like any other
accessory fashion store that I


302
0:24:33,56 --> 0:24:36,641
might find in the world.


303
0:24:36,641 --> 0:24:40,15
Except that you sell bleaching
cream just like


304
0:24:40,15 --> 0:24:42,25
it's another accessory.


305
0:24:42,25 --> 0:24:46,88
What is it about being lighter
at the moment that is more


306
0:24:46,88 --> 0:24:48,13
attractive?


307
0:24:48,13 --> 0:24:51,274



308
0:24:51,274 --> 0:24:52,768

309
0:24:52,768 --> 0:25:9,6



310
0:25:9,6 --> 0:25:12,92
CHARLENE: Despite the risk of
atrophy, stretch marks,


311
0:25:12,92 --> 0:25:16,62
chemical burns, and acne, not
to mention the long-term


312
0:25:16,62 --> 0:25:19,85
systemic health effects such
as Cushing's syndrome and


313
0:25:19,85 --> 0:25:23,99
diabetes, many girls and boys
continue to bleach in the name


314
0:25:23,99 --> 0:25:25,592
of fashion.


315
0:25:25,592 --> 0:25:28,46
The girls we'd met were
unwilling to actually apply it


316
0:25:28,46 --> 0:25:32,28
in front of us, so we headed to
one of Kingston's premier


317
0:25:32,28 --> 0:25:37,9
strip clubs, Caesar's, to
meet a girl who would.


318
0:25:37,9 --> 0:25:41,255
So the girls that we spoke to
before, they were really open


319
0:25:41,255 --> 0:25:45,42
about skin bleaching and they
let us talk about it for ages.


320
0:25:45,42 --> 0:25:49,585
When it came down to actually
showing us how the process is


321
0:25:49,585 --> 0:25:51,79
done, they were a bit
uncomfortable doing it.


322
0:25:51,79 --> 0:25:56,3
So, we've been put in touch with
a girl who works here.


323
0:25:56,3 --> 0:26:0,739
This is a strip club in Kingston
called Caesar's.


324
0:26:0,739 --> 0:26:2,727
I've got to tell you, she's
not a stripper,


325
0:26:2,727 --> 0:26:4,23
she's only a hostess.


326
0:26:4,23 --> 0:26:7,95
But she's going to show us and
hopefully give us some further


327
0:26:7,95 --> 0:26:11,74
insight into why girls bleach.


328
0:26:11,74 --> 0:26:13,198
What do the men here want?

0:26:13,198 --> 0:26:18,35

0:26:18,35 --> 0:26:20,68

0:26:20,68 --> 0:26:27,796



332
0:26:27,796 --> 0:26:31,39

of what the demand is,


333
0:26:31,39 --> 0:26:32,67
lighter-skinned girls?


334
0:26:32,67 --> 0:27:1,16



335
0:27:1,16 --> 0:27:5,41
CHARLENE: So using skin
bleachers is logical, really.


336
0:27:5,41 --> 0:27:6,66
It makes sense--


337
0:27:6,66 --> 0:27:45,642



338
0:27:45,642 --> 0:27:46,558
CHARLENE: Interesting.


339
0:27:46,558 --> 0:27:49,938
Do you ever think about it,
and just wish that it was


340
0:27:49,938 --> 0:27:53,27
different and the trend
was to be black?


341
0:27:53,27 --> 0:28:1,39



342
0:28:1,39 --> 0:28:3,89
CHARLENE: She took us into one
of the back rooms usually


343
0:28:3,89 --> 0:28:6,82
reserved for more amorous
encounters where she could


344
0:28:6,82 --> 0:28:10,12
demonstrate her bleaching
technique.


345
0:28:10,12 --> 0:28:12,71
So show me what you do.


346
0:28:12,71 --> 0:28:14,403
HOSTESS: All right.


347
0:28:14,403 --> 0:29:1,8



348
0:29:1,8 --> 0:29:2,92

would happen if I used it?

0:29:5,48 --> 0:29:36,75

0:29:36,75 --> 0:29:38,0
CHARLENE: Shall I try?

0:29:38,0 --> 0:29:41,794



353
0:29:41,794 --> 0:29:44,11
CHARLENE: It's definitely
a little bit warm.


354
0:29:44,11 --> 0:29:45,36
HOSTESS: Yeah.

0:29:45,36 --> 0:29:52,5



356
0:29:52,5 --> 0:29:55,161

with this under your clothes?

0:29:56,411 --> 0:30:12,27

CHARLENE: If you have a
boyfriend already, doesn't it


360
0:30:14,65 --> 0:30:16,67
interfere with your sex life?

CHARLENE: What's
more important?

0:30:22,12 --> 0:30:40,896

0:30:40,896 --> 0:30:43,21

366
0:30:43,21 --> 0:31:0,66



367
0:31:0,66 --> 0:31:2,69
CHARLENE: Some of the beauty
trends we've seen here may


368
0:31:2,69 --> 0:31:5,86
appear extreme, but when put
up against permatanning and


369
0:31:5,86 --> 0:31:9,24
plastic surgery, it's just
another example of the theory


370
0:31:9,24 --> 0:31:13,21
that making our self darker,
lighter, fatter, or thinner,


371
0:31:13,21 --> 0:31:15,532
is going to radically
alter your fortune.


372
0:31:15,532 --> 0:31:18,85



373
0:31:18,85 --> 0:31:21,6
Fashion week had definitely been
a celebration of the more


374
0:31:21,6 --> 0:31:25,2
positive side of Jamaican
fashion, but I think couture


375
0:31:25,2 --> 0:31:27,93
will have a tough job taking
over from dancehall as the


376
0:31:27,93 --> 0:31:31,15
flagship of Jamaican style.


377
0:31:31,15 --> 0:31:33,934
And a good thing, too.
