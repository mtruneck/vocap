###56 PLAY BALL! >> THAT'S RIGHT.
###57 OKAY, RBI AND SOFTBALL, WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO?
###61 >> WELL, IT'S THE SAME. RBI HAS A BASEBALL PROGRAM AS
###64 WELL AS A SOFTBALL PROGRAM, AND THE SOFTBALL, OF COURSE, IS FOR
###67 THE YOUNG LADIES AND BASEBALL IS FOR -- WE HAVE A CO-ED PROGRAM
###70 AS THE YOUNGER AGES AND AS THEY GET OLDER, IT'S JUST BASEBALL
###74 FOR THE GUYS. >> OKAY.
###77 AND WITH THE GALS, AS THEY GROW OLDER, THEY STICK WITH THE --
###81 >> SOFTBALL, YES, SIR. >> OKAY.
###83 NOW, I GOT TO TELL YOU, I'M KIND OF LEARNING SOME NEW INSIDES
###87 WITH THE FITNESS CENTER AND WITH RPOS.
###89 >> YES, SIR. >> REALLY, I THINK OUR
###93 BACKGROUND IS REALLY OUT IN THE FIELD, ISN'T IT?
###95 >> IT IS ON THE FIELD AND SPEAKING OF THE FITNESS CENTER,
###96 I HEARD YOU'VE BEEN SPENDING SOME TIME OVER AT NORFOLK
###99 FITNESS AND WELLNESS CENTER. >> THE WORD IS GETTING OUT?
###101 >> YEAH, I HEARD YOU OVER THERE BREAKING RECORDS AND ALL KINDS
###104 OF STUFF. >> THAT'S RIGHT, I MADE A
###108 COMMITMENT BECAUSE YOU GUYS KEEP COMING ON THE SOFA AND
###111 HARANGUING ME ABOUT NOT GETTING OUT THERE AND PLAYING SOFTBALL,
###114 BUT I'M NOT READY. >> YOU ARE READY.
###116 >> MY WIFE TAKES ME BALLROOM DANCING, I GET WINDED, SO I WENT
###120 AHEAD AND WENT WITH IT AS PART OF OUR HEALTHY NORFOLK
###123 INITIATIVES A I'M GOING TO START WORKING OUT AND I'M GOING TO LET
###125 THE VIEWERS SEE IT AND IT'S ON THIS WEEK AND IF I CAN DO IT,
###130 ANYBODY CAN DO IT. TALKING ABOUT IT, LOOK AT YOU,
###134 MR. SELF. >> NO, I'M TRYING TO STAY IN
###137 SHAPE AND EAT RIGHT AND EXERCISE REGULARLY.
###140 >> I'M ON MY SECOND PROTEIN BAR FOR THE DAY AND I'M GOING TO
###143 SUCK MY BELLY BUTTON INTO MY SPINE.
###145 >> I'M SURE YOU'LL BE FINE. >> IS THAT WHAT WE DO, SUPERMAN?
###149 >> NO. POKE YOUR CHEST OUT, THERE YOU
###151 GO. >> CONTINUE TALKING WHILE I DO
###153 THAT. RBI.
###154 >> IT'S THE INITIATIVE IF MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL.
###159 >> THAT'S THE BIG-LEAGUE GUYS. >> YES, SIR, REVITALIZING
###161 BASEBALL IN THE CITY AND THE KEY IS TO GET INNER CITY KIDS BACK
###164 INTO BASEBALL. IT'S GREAT.
###167 THEY HAVE A BUNCH OF RESOURCES FOR US TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND NOT
###171 JUST BASEBALL AS WE SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER, IT'S SOFTBALL AS WELL
###175 AND FOR AGES 5 TO 17. AND IT'S A GREAT TIME.
###180 AND THE KIDS WHO ARE SUCCESSFUL WITH THE TEAMS, THEY HAVE AN
###183 OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE ON TO NATIONAL TOURNAMENTS, SO, YEAH.
###186 >> THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF. >> YES, SIR.
###188 THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY IN NATIONAL TOURNAMENTS SO IT
###191 GIVES OUR KIDS THE TYPE OF EXPOSURE TO GET THEM TO THE NEXT
###194 LEVEL. >> BECAUSE I REMEMBER GOING TO
###196 THE, YOU KNOW, BASICALLY FIELD AND THE LOCAL NEIGHBORHOOD AND
###198 WE DID THE WHOLE THING ABOUT FOLLOWING THE BAT.
###200 AND I WAS ALWAYS LAST ONE OUT BECAUSE I WAS BAT BOY.
###203 WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT KIND OF INFORMAL PICK-UP GAME.
###205 >> NO, SIR, THIS IS LIKE ANY OTHER REGULAR LITTLE LEAGUE
###209 BASEBALL, BUT THIS IS SPONSORED BY MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL SO
###214 WE'VE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO US THAT OTHER LEAGUES DON'T HAVE.
###219 FOR INSTANCE, WE MAY HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO TRAVEL AND PLAY
###223 AGAINST DIFFERENT RBI TEAMS IN NORTH CAROLINA OR IN FLORIDA,
###227 YOU KNOW, SO IT'S GREAT. AND PLUS WE ALSO HAVE, YOU KNOW,
###231 MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL PLAYERS WHO WILL COME BACK AND SPEAK TO
###234 OUR KIDS, SO WE HAVE TRAINING AND STUFF LIKE THAT.
###237 >> COOL. WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT
###238 TRAVELING TO NORTH CAROLINA, THAT GETS EXPENSIVE, WON'T IT?
###241 >> IT CAN, BUT LIKE I SAID, THE RESOURCES THAT MAJOR BASEBALL
###244 PROVIDE, THEY ALSO GIVE US FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO TAKE SOME
###250 OF THESE TRIPS. >> OKAY.
###251 SO REALLY, IT'S OPENING IT UP TO KIDS WHO MAY NOT THINK THEY HAVE
###254 A CHANCE BECAUSE OF THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES INSTEAD OF THEIR
###257 TALENT. >> CIRCUMSTANCES, KIDS THAT VENT
###259 BEEN EXPOSED TO BASEBALL, YOU KNOW.
###261 RIGHT NOW, BEING COMPLETELY HONEST WITH YOU, FOOTBALL AND
###264 BASKETBALL IS KIND OF LIKE RULING IN SPORTS RIGHT NOW.
###267 >> I KNOW. >> AND THERE ARE OTHER
###268 OPPORTUNITIES, BASEBALL, TENNIS, LACROSSE, SOCCER, ALL THOSE
###274 SPORTS THAT I THINK THEY NEED TO BE EXPOSED TO AND THIS IS JUST
###277 ONE WAY WE CAN GET GOING IN THIS PARTICULAR SPORT, WHICH IS
###280 BASEBALL, AND I MEAN, IT'S A GREAT DEAL.
###283 YOU'RE BACKED BY MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL, SO --
###284 >> SO ALL THE SPORTS YOU TALK ABOUT, WE CAN GET PLUGGED INTO
###288 AT THE REC CENTER. >> YES, SIR.
###290 >> SO IT'S REALLY SIMPLE AND A LOT OF OUR REC CENTERS ARE
###292 WALKING DISTANCE FROM EVERYBODY'S HOUSE.
###294 >> YES. >> IN ORDER TO GET PLUGGED INTO
###295 RBI, HOW DO THEY GO ABOUT DOING THAT.
###298 >> CALL LAKEWOOD, AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A REGISTRATION
###303 ENDING THE END OF MARCH, MARCH 29th.
###306 WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SKILLS CLINIC MARCH THE 23rd AT
###310 BRAMBLETON REC CENTER, SO ALL KIDS OUT THERE INTERESTED IN
###313 JUST LEARNING DEVELOPMENTAL SKILLS, THEY CAN COME OVER TO
###316 BRAMBLETON REC CENTER MARCH 23rd AND WE ALSO HAVE -- I CAN'T GO
###320 FURTHER WITHOUT MENTIONING NORFOLK POLICE DEPARTMENT AND
###325 THE PALS, HOLLY WILLIAMS, SHE'S AWESOME.
###328 THEY HAVE BEEN SUPPORTING US, HELPING US OUT WITH THE BATTING

###339 STUFF FOR THE KIDS AND HE'S GOING TO ACTUALLY RUN THOSE
###342 CAMPS AND CLINICS. THEY'RE GETTING COLLEGE
###345 COACHING. >> COOL, SO IT'S REALLY HOOKED
###347 UP. WEBSITE FOR SOMEBODY TO GO TO?
###351 >> NORFOLK.GOV. >> AND LIKE WOOD, WHERE IS THAT
###354 LOCATED. >> 1612 WILLOW WOOD DRIVE,
###357 BETWEEN TIDEWATER DRIVE AND GRANBY STREET.
###360 >> I GOT TO TELL YOU, MY BELLY BUTTON MOVED AWAY FROM MY SPINE,
###365 SO THIS IS OVER. >> NO, JUST WORKING ON IT AND
###368 PRETTY SOON, YOUR CHEST WILL STICK OUT JUST BECAUSE.
###373 >> WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE NEL PROGRAM
###378 AND NO, IT'S NOT
###399 A GAL. \M [ SINGING ] \M
###407 >> 60 MINUTES OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY A DAY AND EATING WELL
###412 CAN HELP GET YOUR CHILD HEALTHY. SO KEEP THEM ACTIVE AND EATING
###415 WELL EVERY DAY. GET IDEAS, GET INVOLVED, GET
###419 GOING, AT LET'S MOVE.GOV. >>> WELCOME BACK TO NORFOLK
###427 PERSPECTIVES. I'M CONFUSED BECAUSE THE PERSON
###430 SITTING ON THE SOFA I KNOW FOR A LONG TIME, JANET WILLIAMS,
###434 YOU'VE BEEN IN HUMAN RESOURCES, BEEN IN PUBLIC WORKS, BEEN IN
###438 I.T., AND NOW YOU'RE IN RECREATION, PARKS AND OPEN
###441 SPACE. I CAN'T THINK OF A BROADER-BASED
###443 PERSON HAVING EXPERIENCE. OH, AND THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE.
###446 WHAT ELSE DID I MISS? >> MANAGER'S OFFICE.
###449 >> MANAGER'S OFFICE. >> AND GRANTS.
###452 >> AND GRANTS. AND NOW YOU'VE BEEN KIND OF THE
###455 LEADER OF NEL. FIRST OF ALL, WHAT IS THAT.
###460 >> IT STANDS FOR NORFOLK EMERGING LEADERS PROGRAM.
###464 >> YOU HAVE THE POSITION DOWN? >> YEAH, WHICH MEANS REACHING
###470 FORWARD WHILE PULLING SOMEONE ALONG.
###472 >> THERE WE GO. >> THAT'S WHAT IT IS NOW, BUT
###475 IT'S BEEN IN EXISTENCE ABOUT SIX TO SEVEN YEARS.
###477 I THINK I'VE BEEN WITH IT ABOUT FIVE YEARS NOW AND IT'S A
###483 PROGRAM THAT'S REALLY STARTING TO KIND OF CHANGE LIVES, YOU
###486 KNOW. THESE PEOPLE THAT COME THROUGH
###487 THESE PROGRAMS, THEY END UP WORKING IN OUR ORGANIZATION AND
###490 WE'RE REALLY PROUD TO BE A PART OF NEL.
###494 >> BECAUSE I KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN THE WORKPLACE.
###497 I MEAN, LET'S FACE IT, INTERNS HAVE THIS REPUTATION -- OR
###502 INTERN PROGRAMS HAVE THIS REPUTATION OF YOU HAVE A HIGH
###504 SCHOOL KID OR COLLEGE KID SHOW UP AT THE WORKPLACE, THEY KIND
###507 OF SURVIVE THE SUMMER AND THEY GO BACK TO SCHOOL.
###510 >> RIGHT. >> THAT'S NOT WHAT NEL IS ABOUT,
###511 IS IT? >> I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS IS
###513 PEOPLE NEED TO STOP THINKING ABOUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
###515 WITH YOUR YOUNG PERSON EARLIER IN THE YEAR.
###518 NEL HAS TWO KEY COMPONENTS. THE FIRST COMPONENT IS A 16 TO
###522 19-YEAR-OLD PROGRAM WHICH FOCUSES ON INDIVIDUALS IN MIDDLE
###525 AND HIGH SCHOOL, AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT CALLED AN INTERNSHIP
###529 PROGRAM, WE FOCUS ON MAKING SURE THAT THEY COME INTO OUR
###532 ORGANIZATION AND REALLY GET A GOOD SENSE OF HOW LOCAL
###534 GOVERNMENT WORKS. WITH THE EXECUTIVE INTERNSHIP
###538 PROGRAM, THAT'S FOR INDIVIDUALS MATRICULATING THROUGH COLLEGE AT
###541 ANY AGE, AND THIS YEAR, WE HAVE BROADENED THAT PROGRAM TO NOT
###545 ONLY HIT UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES WITHIN THE STATE OF
###548 VIRGINIA, BUT WE HAVE ACTUALLY OPENED IT NATIONWIDE.
###551 AND YOU WANT AN EXECUTIVE INTERN AND THAT MEANS YOU REPORT TO THE
###554 CITY MANAGER'S OFFICE AND OUT OF THAT OFFICE, YOU MAY BE ROUTED
###557 TO ANOTHER DEPARTMENT, BUT YOUR KEY FOCUS IS YOU'RE GOING TO
###560 WORK ON TWO OF OUR MAJOR INITIATIVES IN THE CITY, WHICH
###562 IS LIFELONG LEARNING AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT, SO THIS
###566 IS A REAL-LIFE JOB BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THIS EXPERIENCE AS AN
###568 EXECUTIVE INTERN, YOU CAN BECOME A FULL-TIME EMPLOYEE AND OUT OF
###572 THE NORFOLK EMERGING LEADERS PROGRAM, YOU CAN ELEVATE AND
###575 BECOME AN EXECUTIVE INTERN WHEN YOU GO THROUGH COLLEGE.
###580 >> WE DO FOCUS, THOUGH, ON LOOKING AT NORFOLK RESIDENTS
###583 EVEN THOUGH THEY MIGHT BE GOING TO SCHOOL THROUGHOUT THE
###585 COUNTRY. >> WE LOVE TO SUPPORT OUR
###586 NORFOLK CITY AND OUR NORFOLK RESIDENTS ARE PART OF WHAT MAKES
###589 OUR CITY GREAT AND THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE FEEL GOOD
###593 ABOUT HAVING THE INITIATIVE FOCUS ON THAT.
###595 >> I'M GOING TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT.
###597 >> OKAY. >> I REMEMBER WE TALKED ON THE
###599 SOFA A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHEN THIS WAS AN IDEA.
###602 >> YEAH. >> WHEN YOU MENTIONED THE IDEA
###604 OF NEL AND THE INTERNS AND FULL-TIME, WE HAVE SOME CASE
###610 STUDIES FOR THAT THAT ARE FOR REAL.
###612 LET'S TALK ABOUT BULLY VIDEO. WHEN I SAY BULLY VIDEO, WHAT DO
###616 YOU THINK ABOUT? >> I THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH
###619 POTENTIAL CAN 20 TO 22 STUDENTS GET DONE IN 20 WEEKS.
###624 I THINK ABOUT GIVE THEM AN ASSIGNMENT AND LET THEM DO IT
###628 AND STEP BACK AND SEE THEM GET IT DONE.
###631 LAST YEAR THEY DEVELOPED A PSA INITIATIVE ON AN ANTI-BULLYING
###634 CAMPAIGN AND THAT'S WHERE THEY COULD HAVE STOPPED.
###638 THEY TOOK THAT CAMPAIGN TO NORFOLK PUBLIC SCHOOLS, THE
###640 PUBLIC SCHOOL BOARD, GOT IT APPROVED, AND TODAY IT'S PART OF
###643 THE CURRICULUM THAT NORFOLK PUBLIC SCHOOLS USES AS A PART OF
###647 THEIR ANTI-BULLYING CAMPAIGN. I THINK SOMETIMES YOU
###649 UNDERESTIMATE THE CAPACITY OF WHAT AN INDIVIDUAL CAN DO AND
###652 WHEN YOU COME TO BE A NORFOLK EMERGING LEADER OR INTERN, WE'RE
###657 GOING TO PUSH YOU AS FAR AS YOU CAN GO.
###659 A PSA DEVELOPED IN TEN WEEKS IS PRETTY AMAZING SO THAT'S WHAT
###664 THEY WERE ABLE TO DO. >> AND PEOPLE SEE THAT PSA ON
###666 THIS STATION ALL THE TIME. >> ALL THE TIME.
###668 >> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE GUY THAT WAS KIND OF THE HUB OF IT,
###671 BRYCE. >> HE CAME THROUGH OUR PROGRAM
###674 LAST YEAR IN 2012 AND HE ACTUALLY WORKED IN CIVIC
###678 FACILITIES AND I BELIEVE HE ACTUALLY WORKS IN COMMUNICATIONS
###682 RIGHT NOW, BUT KINETIC TECHNOLOGY I THINK IS HIS MAJOR
###685 AND JUST ALL KINDS OF MAJORS. BUT THE INTEREST TO BE IN
###689 GOVERNMENT IS WHERE BRYCE MAKES US MOST PROUD AND HE'S SOMEONE
###692 WE'RE PROUD TO CALL A CITY EMPLOYEE RIGHT NOW.
###695 >> IT'S REALLY COOL -- AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT BRYCE EVEN THOUGH
###697 HE'S NOT HERE, BECAUSE WHAT HE REPRESENTS IS HE WASN'T WILLING
###701 TO JUST STICK WITH CHECKING THE BOX.
###703 >> NO. >> HE ACTUALLY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF
###704 HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY, HEY, I'VE GOT A LOT OF FIRE IN
###707 MY BELLY THAT I WANT TO GIVE TO THE CITY AND WE'RE NOW SEEING
###709 HIS WORK ON THE STATION A LOT. >> IT'S NOT THAT YOU GOT TO PUSH
###714 THEM. YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE
###715 COMMUNICATION IS REALLY GOOD WITH THEM BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE
###718 HAVE HIDDEN TALENTS THAT COME INTO A JOB THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW
###721 WHAT TO EXPECT, THAT CAN REALLY KIND OF BRING OUT THE BEST IN
###724 THEM, SO NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE QUIET PERSON OR THE INTROVERT.
###727 >> I KNOW THERE'S A MOM OUT THERE WHO SAYS MY DAUGHTER JANET
###731 IS GOING TO MAKE IT, SO WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY SO THAT MOM OF
###734 JANET? >> THAT MOM OF JANET?
###738 >> WHAT SHOULD JANET BE DOING IN ORDER TO APPLY?
###741 >> SHE SHOULD BE MAKING SURE THAT SHE'S EITHER GONE TO HER
###743 LOCAL LIBRARY OR THE NORFOLK.GOV WEBSITE WHERE THE NEL
###748 APPLICATIONS ARE, NOT ONLY THE NORFOLK EMERGING LEADERS
###752 APPLICATION IS OUT THERE, BUT THE EXECUTIVE INTERN APPLICATION
###755 IS OUT THERE ALSO. THOSE APPLICATIONS WILL BE OUT
###759 THERE UNTIL MARCH THE 15th, SO THIS IS A CREDIT CAM TIME RIGHT
###762 NOW -- CRITICAL TIME RIGHT NOW WE'RE ASKING YOU TO THINK ABOUT
###765 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IN THE SUMMER RIGHT NOW.
###767 >> AND WHEN YOU AND YOUR TEAM ARE MAKING THE DECISION, IT WILL
###771 BE A TOUGH JOB. >> IT WILL BE TOUGH.
###774 >> THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU BROUGHT TO THE CITY, BUT ALSO TO
###777 OUR YOUTH IN THE COMMUNITY INVESTING IN THE FUTURE.
###779 >> YOU'RE WELCOME. >> APPRECIATE IT.
###781 >>> WHEN WE COME BACK, IT'S JUST ABOUT ME BEING COOL IN THE
###784 SUMMER, IT'S YOU TOO WHEN YOU COME TO CITY HALL.
###789 STAY TUNED. >>> HEY, SANDRA.
###795 >> OH, SORRY. I'M JUST REALLY SURPRISED AT HOW
###801 EXPENSIVE FOOD HAS GOTTEN. WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO PUT ASIDE
###804 SOME MONEY TO BUY A HOUSE, BUT WE CAN BARELY MAKE IT FROM ONE
###808 CHECK TO THE NEXT. >> I'M IN THE SAME BOAT, BUT
###810 WITH THE MONEY I'M GETTING FROM THE EITC, WE'RE BETTER OFF.
###814 IT'S THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT.
###820 >> FOR MORE ON THE EITC AND FREE TAX PREPARATION, CALL OR VISIT
###824 OUR WEBSITE. >> WELCOME BACK TO NORFOLK
###828 PERSPECTIVES. WE'VE GONE FROM ALL KINDS OF
###831 THINGS AND NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MY COMFORT AT THE OFFICE.
###834 IS THIS WHAT IT'S ABOUT, MY COMFORT AT THE OFFICE?
###836 DENISE THOMPSON. >> IT'S PARTLY ABOUT YOUR
###838 COMFORT, BOB. ACTUALLY, IF EVERYTHING WORKS
###843 FINE, YOU WILL BE COMPLETELY COMFORTABLE AND YOU WON'T EVEN
###845 KNOW WE'RE REDUCING COSTS AND REDUCING OUR ENERGY USE AT THE
###848 SAME TIME. >> YOU JUST TOLD ME I HAD
###850 NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. >> NO, YOU DO BECAUSE YOU'RE THE
###854 CLIENT, REALLY, OF OUR CENTRAL ENERGY PLANT AND WE WANTED TO
###858 COME AND TALK WITH YOU ABOUT IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE MADE TO THE
###861 CENTRAL ENERGY PLANT AND WHY, AND HOW THAT TIES IN WITH THE
###864 BIG PICTURE OF SUSTAINING NORFOLK'S ENVIRONMENT.
###868 >> OKAY, JERRY SPIVEY. >> YES.
###870 >> NOW, YOU'RE RIGHT-OF-WAY PROGRAM MANAGER.
###872 HOW DID YOU GET WRAPPED UP IN THIS?
###874 >> WELL, I WEAR MANY HAT. >> WHICH IS A LOT OF PEOPLE IN
###877 CITY HALL. >> YOU HAVE TO.
###878 I'M A CERTIFIED ENERGY MANAGER AND I'VE WORKED WITH DENISE
###881 SINCE SHE'S BEEN WITH THE CITY ON ENERGY PROJECTS AND WE
###886 RECENTLY COMPLETED PURCHASE OF A SOFTWARE CALLED ENERGY CAP AND
###892 WHAT WE DO WITH THAT IS WE INPUT ALL THE UTILITY BILLS FROM ALL
###896 OVER THE CITY, ALL THE DEPARTMENTS.
###900 >> YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF FACILITIES.
###902 >> HUNDREDS. 100 BUILDINGS, 3.5 MILLION
###903 SQUARE FEET AND WE PUT ALL THE INFORMATION IN, NATIONAL GAS,
###908 ELECTRICITY, WATER, OIL, AND WE -- MEASURE, MANAGE AND SAVE
###913 IS WHAT WE LIKE TO SAY. >> SO JERRY SAYS THERE'S A LOT
###916 TO BE DONE AND SHE'S A -- YEAH, OLIVER, ARE YOU DESIGNING IT?
###922 >> I'M DESIGNING IT. >> I FIGURED THAT ONE OUT?
###924 >> YOU FIGURED THAT ONE OUT. >> WE CAN GO OVER THAT.
###927 >> I'M OVERSEEING THE CONSTRUCTION AS WELL.
###929 >> CAN I BE FRANK WITH YOU GUYS? >> ABSOLUTELY.
###931 >> I HAD NO IDEA THIS WAS GOING ON.
###935 >> THAT'S THE WAY WE LIKE IT. IF YOU DON'T KNOW, WE'RE DOING
###938 IT RIGHT. WE DID OVER A $4 MILLION
###942 IMPROVEMENT OF THE CENTRAL FLANT AND YOU DIDN'T -- PLANT AND YOU
###944 DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT WAS GOING ON.
###946 >> CAN I ASK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION?
###947 >> YOU SURE CAN. >> WHERE'S THE CENTRAL PLANT?
###951 I MEAN TALK ABOUT BEHIND THE SCENES.
###955 I THINK THE GUYS -- IS IT IN THE CENTER PART OF THE CITY?
###958 >> IT IS NOT. THE CENTRAL PLANT IS PROBABLY --
###960 JERRY, YOU CAN HELP ME WITH THIS.
###962 I WOULD SAY A THOUSAND FEET OUTSIDE THE CITY COMPLEX.
###966 >> BY THE CITY GARAGE. >> OH, THE BUILDING I WALK PAST
###968 EVERY DAY, THAT ONE WITH STEAM COMING OUT.
###971 >> THAT'S IT. >> NOW, DOES THAT -- MYTH HAS IT
###975 THAT NOT ONLY CONTROLS MY OFFICE, BUT THE OTHER
###978 FACILITIES? >> THE JAIL, CITY COURT, THE
###981 CITY HALL. >> I'M ASSUMING THE NEW
###983 COURTHOUSE IS GOING UP. >> YES.
###985 >> THEY SAID FINALLY WE'RE GOING TO BUILD SOMETHING INDEPENDENT
###987 OF ALL THAT. >> THAT'S CORRECT.
###990 >> IT'S BEING POWERED BY THE CENTRAL ENERGY PLANT.
###993 >> HEATING AND COOLING COMES FROM THE CENTRAL PLANT FOR THE
###996 NEW COURTHOUSE. >> AND THE NEW COURTHOUSE, AND
###999 AGAIN, THIS TIES IN WITH THE BIG PICTURE OF SUPPORTING
###1003 ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AND SUSTAINABILITY AND REDUCING
###1006 COSTS AND THE NEW COURTHOUSE BEEN A LEED CERTIFIED BUILDING,
###1010 WHICH MEANS LEADERSHIP IN ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN AND IT
###1013 WILL HAVE SPECIAL ENERGY-SAVING FEATURES, RECYCLED MATERIALS
###1018 FEATURES. IT'S LOCATED NEAR TRANSIT, SO
###1021 THAT'S A GOOD THING. WE HAVE LOTS OF LEED BUILDINGS
###1024 IN NORFOLK. >> SO HOW ARE YOU ABLE TO PULL
###1025 THAT OFF WITH A PLANT -- I'M ASSUMING PLANT WAS BUILT ABOUT
###1028 THE SAME TIME CITY HALL WAS, WHICH WAS BEFORE DENISE WAS
###1031 BORN. >> THANK YOU, BOB.
###1034 >> 1965, RIGHT? YEAH, IT WAS BUILT AROUND 1965,
###1040 SO SOME WOULD SAY, TEAR IT DOWN, REPLACE IT WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY.
###1043 IT DOESN'T WORK THAT DAY, DOES IT?
###1045 >> WELL, WE HAD A REALLY GOOD PLANT AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO TALK
###1048 ABOUT SOME OF THE INNOVATIVE FEATURES.
###1049 >> LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THE PLANT WORKS AND I'M
###1051 GOING TO KEEP IT SIMPLE. >> PLEASE, BECAUSE I'M DOING
###1054 THIS TO MY THERMOSTAT. >> WE'VE BASICALLY HAD PIPES
###1057 THAT RUN FROM THE CENTRAL PLANT. >> I'VE BEEN IN THE TUNNEL.
###1061 >> EXACTLY. OVER TO THE VARIOUS BUILDINGS,
###1063 CITY HALL, THE JAIL, THE COURT, AND THEY SUPPLY COLD WATER AND
###1069 HOT WATER AND THE PIPES SEND THAT WATER THROUGH COILS THAT
###1074 ARE IN AIR HANDLING UNITS AND THAT DISTRIBUTES THE COLD AIR OR
###1077 HOT AIR IN THE BUILDING. WELL, WHAT WE DID WAS WE
###1080 BASICALLY TOOK THAT EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND IMPROVED IT.
###1083 WE PUT IN MORE EFFICIENT MOTORS, MORE EFFICIENT CHILLERS, ADDED
###1089 BOILERS, ADDED DIGITAL CONTROLS TO THAT EQUIPMENT.
###1092 SO THAT'S THE WAY WE TOOK THAT 1965 TECHNOLOGY AND BROUGHT IT
###1096 UP TO DATE. >> NOW, I REMEMBER SITTING IN
###1098 COMMITTEE MEETINGS WITH YOU, DENISE, SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHEN
###1100 THE MANAGER CAME ON BOARD AND REALLY LOOKED AT DOING THIS KIND
###1104 OF STUFF AND BIG BUCKS CAN BE SAVED.
###1106 >> ABSOLUTELY, AS OPPOSED TO STARTING FROM SCRATCH AND
###1108 BUILDING A WHOLE NEW PLANT. >> BUT NEVER ONCE DID I HEAR YOU
###1111 TALK ABOUT BRINGING A SWEATER TO WORK.
###1114 I THOUGHT CONSERVING ENERGY IN THE WINTER MEANT GETTING COLD.
###1119 >> NO, NO, NO. ON YOU SOMETIMES HEAR PEOPLE --
###1120 YOU SOMETIMES HEAR PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT
###1123 AND SUSTAINABILITY, THEY SAY IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE, PLANET AND
###1129 POCKETBOOK. SO THE GOAL IS FOR YOU TO BE
###1133 COMFORTABLE AND PRODUCTIVE AND FOR IT NOT TO COST A LOT, FOR US
###1137 TO CONTINUE TO USE LESS ENERGY AND THAT THEN KEEPS THE COST
###1142 DOWN, AND TO -- BY USING LESS ENERGY, WE'RE -- WE'VE GOT LESS
###1147 OF AN IMPACT, LESS OF A CARBON FOOTPRINT ON THE PLANET.
###1150 >> IT'S KIND OF COOL BECAUSE I GOT TO TELL YOU, WHEN I GO IN
###1153 THE MEN'S ROOM, I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT TURNING THE LIGHTS
###1156 ON AND OFF. >> IT'S MAGIC.
###1157 >> HOW DO THEY KNOW I'M THERE? >> I LOVE AUTOMATION.
###1160 THEY DO KNOW YOU'RE THERE AND THEY TURN OFF AFTER ABOUT 10 OR
###1165 15 MINUTES DEPENDING ON HOW THEY'RE SET AND THAT WAS A
###1167 WONDERFUL -- THAT WAS OLIVER'S PROJECT.
###1169 THAT WAS A WONDERFUL APPLICATION.
###1171 >> YOUR PROJECT? >> YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT
###1174 THAT. >> WONDERFUL TECHNOLOGY.
###1176 >> IS THAT THE KIND OF THING WE'RE SEEING INCORPORATED
###1178 NATURALLY INTO THE NEW COURTHOUSE, RIGHT?
###1180 >> ABSOLUTELY. >> AND WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT
###1182 UNTIL THEN. I'VE BEEN OVER TO THE FITNESS
###1184 CENTER, AS WE ALL HEARD, AND SOME OF THE NEW ONES --
###1190 >> YES, WE'RE PUTTING THOSE IN FACILITIES NOW.
###1193 WHEN WE GO IN, WE'RE DOING RENOVATIONS, ESPECIALLY IN
###1195 RESTROOMS AND CONFERENCE ROOMS THAT ARE NOT ATTENDED OFTEN AND
###1200 THAT'S THE PRIME OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THOSE TYPE OF FEATURES.
###1202 >> I WAS AT LAMBERT'S POINT AND THE WHOLE GYM, WALKED IN AND THE
###1208 SAME, WHATEVER IT IS, ELF. >> ABSOLUTELY.
###1211 >> THE LIGHTS CAME ON. >> IT'S A FABULOUS TECHNOLOGY
###1213 BECAUSE IF THE LIGHTS ARE LEFT ON INADVERTENTLY ALL NIGHT LONG,
###1216 YOU'RE BURNING WHAT? EIGHT, 10, 12, 14 HOURS OF
###1220 ENERGY FOR NOTHING. >> BUT DENISE, LET'S BE CANDID.
###1225 WE HAVE THE MONEY IN THE BUDGET. DOESN'T IT JUST WORK THAT WAY?
###1228 YOU BUDGET FOR ENERGY. WHAT'S THE PUSH?
###1232 >> NO, NO, BECAUSE YOU BUDGET SO THAT YOU CAN MEET YOUR NEEDS AS
###1238 WELL AS MEET THE NEEDS OF THE FUTURE.
###1240 SO WE'RE IN A TIME WHEN WE'RE ALL LOOKING AT THE BUDGET AND IF
###1246 THERE'S PLACES THAT WE COULD SAVE MONEY AT THE SAME TIME THAT
###1250 WE CAN MEET OUR GOALS, THEN YOU DON'T -- YOU DON'T WANT A BUDGET
###1254 THAT'S HIGHER THAN YOU NEED. WHY WOULD YOU -- WE COULD SPEND
###1257 THAT MONEY ON SCHOOLS, SPEND THAT MONEY ON BIKE RACKS, SPEND
###1261 THAT MONEY OR NOT SPEND THAT MONEY AND KEEP OUR TAX RATES
###1264 DOWN. >> YOU SOUND LIKE THE PEOPLE I
###1264 HEARD AT THE COMMUNITY CONVERSATION.
###1266 >> I KNOW. >> I JUST GOT THE WRAP-UP TIME,
###1268 BUT YOU SAID THIS HAD A LOT TO DO WITH THE COURTHOUSE.
###1272 >> WE BROUGHT THIS FOR YOU. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE OLD
###1277 PART OF THE PLANT DOES AND PART OF THE REASON WE KEPT IT IS WE
###1280 CHILL WATER AT NIGHT IN THE SUMMERTIME WHEN THE RATES ARE
###1283 LOW AND THEN WE USE THAT WATER TO COOL OUR FACILITIES.
###1287 AND IT'S A GIANT THERMOS, SO -- >> I THINK OF THE THREE OF YOU
###1290 GUYS EVERY TIME I DRINK OUT OF IT.
###1291 THANK YOU. >> YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.
###1292 >> THANKS FOR KEEPING US ON THE LEADING EDGE BY BEING LEED.
###1295 >>> WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE PARTY EVERYBODY
###1298 KNOWS ABOUT, THE OESHVIEW PARADE BY THE KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS.
###1317 STAY TUNED. >>> THE AVERAGE TEXT TAKES YOUR
###1329 EYES OFF THE ROAD FOR NEARLY FIVE SECONDS.
###1336 [ SOUNDS OF CRASH ] >>> WELCOME BACK TO NORFOLK
###1350 PERSPECTIVES. OKAY, WE'RE READY TO ROLL OUT
###1352 THE BIGGEST, THE BEST PARADE IN MARCH IN OCEAN VIEW EVER, RIGHT?
###1359 >> SATURDAY, MARCH 16th, 10:00, NORTH SIDE MIDDLE SCHOOL AT
###1364 GRANBY AND WESTMONT. CONGRESSMAN SCOTT RICHELLE WILL
###1369 BE CUTTING THE TAPE AND THE PARADE STARTS NORTH ON GRANBY
###1373 STREET. >> AND CARL, YOU ARE THE MEDIA
###1376 COMMUNITY LIAISON WITH THAT, AND IF WE TELL PEOPLE THAT'S WHEN
###1379 THEY NEED TO BE THERE, THEY'RE GOING TO MISS THE PARADE.
###1382 >> WE TELL PEOPLE TO GET THERE EARLY, GET THEIR PARKING, BE
###1386 RESPECTFUL OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD PARKING SITUATION.
###1389 THERE ARE PARKING LOTS TO THE NORTH PART OF THE CITY ALONG THE
###1393 BEACHFRONT THERE, BUT GET THERE EARLY BECAUSE PARKING IS VERY
###1397 LIMITED. >> IT'S PRIME.
###1398 JIMMY ROGERS, YOU'RE THE CHAIR, THE ONE PULLING ALL THE STRINGS
###1403 AND MAKING IT WORK. >> I KIND OF DIRECT EVERYBODY
###1406 AND MAKES SURE IT GETS DONE. >> IN FULL DISCLOSURE, AS HOST
###1412 OF THE SHOW, I HAVE A LOT OF FUN, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY
###1414 BETWEEN TAPES SHOWS, I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF WORKING WITH GUYS
###1417 LIKE YOU AND WE'VE BEEN SPENDING THE LAST -- YOU'VE BEEN SPENDING
###1420 THE LAST YEAR GETTING READY FOR THIS PARADE, RIGHT?
###1422 >> YES. JIMMY CALLED EVERYBODY TO WORK,
###1426 RIGHT BACK IN LATE JUNE AND WE'VE BEEN MEETING WITHIN THE
###1432 PARADE COMMITTEE ITSELF, WE'VE BEEN MEETING WITH THE CIVIC
###1434 LEAGUES IN THE COMMUNITY TO GET THE THEME AND ISSUES THAT WE
###1439 WANTED TO ADDRESS WITH THE PARADE, AND IT'S A LOT OF WORK.
###1443 >> YEAH, BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE -- JIMMY, HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
###1445 CHAIRMAN OF THE PARADE? >> ALMOST TEN YEARS.
###1448 >> SO YOU FORGOT WHEN THEY SOLD YOU THE BILL OF GOODS ABOUT
###1450 CHAIRING THIS -- >> ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS BE
###1453 THERE. >> JUST SHOW UP AND PUNCH
###1455 TICKETS, RIGHT? >> YEAH.
###1456 >> HOW DO YOU PULL IT OFF? >> WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE
###1460 CITY, THE CULTURAL EVENTS DEPARTMENT AND THEY HELP US WITH
###1463 ALL THE OPERATIONS THE CITY WOULD TAKE CARE OF, SO POLICE,
###1468 TRAFFIC, GETTING THE PERMITS AND ALL THE THINGS THAT WE NEED IN
###1472 THAT AREA, BUT THEN WE WORK WITH PEOPLE, THE SHRINERS ARE A BIG
###1476 PART OF OUR PARADE. THEY BRING A LOT -- THEY ARE
###1479 PARADE PEOPLE AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE OTHER GROUPS AND
###1482 ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE CITY AND THE ENTIRE HAMPTON
###1485 ROADS AREA THAT WANT TO BE PART OF IT, BUT WE TRY TO BRING
###1489 SOMETHING THAT'S NOT ONLY ENTERTAINING, BUT INFORMATIONAL
###1493 TO THE PUBLIC. >> YEAH, I GOT TO -- I'M NOT
###1496 SURE IF I SHARED THIS, BUT I HAD THE PLEASURE OF DRIVING IN THE
###1499 PARADE IN 2004. MY DAUGHTER WAS MISS NORFOLK,
###1502 AND SO WE WERE IN THE PARADE. YOU GUYS PUT US BACK BY THE FIRE
###1505 TRUCK, BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY. BUT BY THE END OF THE PARADE,
###1508 SHE HAD BEEN PROPOSED TO SIX TIMES.
###1511 >> I BELIEVE IT. >> SHE DIDN'T ACCEPT ANY OF
###1513 THEM, BUT THE PEOPLE, THE CROWDS, IT'S A
###1516 COMMUNITY-BUILDING EVENT. >> WE HEAR ALL THE TIME THROUGH
###1519 THE CIVIC LEAGUES AND THE COMMUNITY PEOPLE, IT'S A REUNION
###1522 TIME AND ALSO TIMED AROUND THE SPRING BREAKS OF THE COLLEGES SO
###1527 A LOT OF YOUNG STUDENTS ARE BACK IN THEIR -- WHERE THEY'RE FROM
###1532 AND THEY COME TO THE PARADE. IT'S A BIG REUNION.
###1534 >> BUT THE COMMUNITY HAS REALLY TAKEN OWNERSHIP OF THIS PARADE.
###1538 THEY WANT TO BE A PART OF IT, AND MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT
###1542 WATCH IT HAVE AT ONE TIME ACTUALLY BEEN IN THE PARADE, SO
###1545 THAT HELPS ADD TO THE EXCITEMENT.
###1546 >> NOW, LAST YEAR WAS A BANNER YEAR BECAUSE IT HAPPENED TO FALL
###1549 ON THE ACTUAL DAY. THIS YEAR, IT'S --
###1553 >> THE 16th. >> THE DAY BEFORE.
###1556 >> BUT WHAT I'M LEARNING IS IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S THE DAY
###1559 OF, THE DAY BEFORE, THE WEEK BEFORE, THE IRISH KNOW HOW TO
###1563 PARTY, BUT DO WE HAVE THAT MANY IRISHMEN IN NORFOLK?
###1565 >>S A PAERGE WE DO BECAUSE -- APPARENTLY WE DO BECAUSE THEY
###1567 ALL COME OUT, BUT THE ENTHUSIASM EVERY YEAR, SOMETIMES THE PARADE
###1572 IS THREE OR FOUR DAYS BEFORE ST. PATRICK'S DAY AND THEY STILL
###1576 COME OUT AND ENJOY THEMSELVES AND HAVE A GOOD TIME.
###1579 >> BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SPECIAL EVENTS CALENDAR, YOU
###1581 GUYS REALLY LAUNCH THE WHOLE CELEBRATION TIME AND THEN
###1584 THERE'S THE GREENING OF GHENT AND THEN THERE'S A CONCERT
###1589 DOWNTOWN THE SAME WEEKEND, SO THERE'S A WHOLE LOT GOING ON.
###1592 >> WE ALWAYS SAY PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF THAT CABIN FEVER AND
###1595 THEY CAN'T WAIT TO GET OUTSIDE AND GET OUT IN THE PARADE AND
###1598 MEET THEIR COMMUNITY. >> BECAUSE I'VE NEVER MET SO
###1601 MANY PEOPLE THAT WANTED TO PARK IN THE MEDIAN.
###1603 I MEAN, THAT'S JUST -- >> THEY'RE THERE THE NIGHT
###1605 BEFORE. >> WE'RE TRYING TO DO -- AND I
###1608 APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENT BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO -- I MEAN, KEEP
###1611 IN MIND THAT PEOPLE LIVE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD TOO.
###1613 >> WE'VE HAD GREAT WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH, AS JIM
###1616 MENTIONED, WITH THE CITY AND CITY OFFICIALS AND THERE'S A LOT
###1618 OF THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING AT AND PUBLIC WORKS THIS
###1621 YEAR, SOME OF THE ISSUES ABOUT CHILDREN REACHING INTO THE
###1625 PARADE, THEY HAVE ADDED YELLOW STRIPING ALONG THE ROADS THERE
###1629 ON THE MEDIAN, SO AGAIN, WE'RE REALLY ASKING PARENTS TO KEEP
###1632 THEIR KIDS BEHIND THE YELL LO LINE SO THEY'RE NOT IN -- YELLOW
###1635 LINE SO THEY'RE NOT IN DANGER, AND JUST YESTERDAY, WE MET WITH
###1639 THE POLICE REPRESENTATIVES TO TALK ABOUT ISSUES.
###1642 >> SO YOU'RE REALLY CONTROLLING IT, BUT IT'S STILL GOING TO BE
###1644 ONE HECK OF A GOOD TIME. >> WE TELL EVERYBODY TO COME AND
###1647 HAVE A GOOD TIME. >> THEY'RE RAISING THE BAR
###1650 BECAUSE I WAS AT A MEETING THE OTHER DAY WITH THE ANIMAL CARE
###1652 CENTER AND THEY'RE ALL EXCITED BECAUSE THEY'RE MOVING FROM
###1655 TIEING TWO GROCERY CARTS TOGETHER TO ACTUALLY HAVING A
