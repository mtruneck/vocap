###26 FILM NARRATOR: This May Day celebration in Moscow gives
###28 the Russians the opportunity to crow loud and
###31 long over the West.
###34 The face of a people whose leaders
###36 would wipe out democracy.
###38 SHANE SMITH: We all know the images of old Soviet Russia.
###40 But in the 1980s, as the walls in Eastern Europe were coming
###43 down, something really freaky happened--
###45 Soviet parallel cinema.

###56 [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###57 
###64 [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###65 
###68 [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###70 
###79 PASHA: We don't like any movie.
###81 We close your screen.
###83 
###87 SHANE SMITH: No one overarching theme to parallel
###89 cinema, except that they're all anti-establishment.
###91 They are madness on film.
###93 
###96 So when we saw them, we realized we have to go Russia,
###98 and we have to meet them.
###100 
###104 [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###105 
###109 [RUSSIAN MARCH]
###116 SHANE SMITH: So right after the Russian Revolution in the
###117 1920s, there was a big creative explosion of
###121 experimental cinema in the new Soviet Union.
###124 Vertov, Eisenstein--
###125 all the big boys were making their films.
###127 
###130 Lenin believed that film was the most important of artistic
###134 expression, because most of the people were illiterate.
###137 But then Stalin took over.
###138 And then you have 60 years of socialist realism--
###142 workers going off to work, farmers going off to farms,
###144 soldiers going off to soldier, et cetera, et cetera.
###147 Until the 1980s, when the Soviet regime started to
###150 crumble and Gorbachev brought about Perestroika and
###153 Glasnost, which means restructuring and reforming.
###156 And for a tiny little window, there was a time when you
###159 think, maybe I could make something and the KBG won't
###162 put me in jail for the rest of my life.
###164 So this new experimental cinema started for the first
###167 time since the '20s.
###168 And it was called parallel cinema.
###172 [RUSSIAN MARCH]
###193 SHANE SMITH: The first person we met up with was Boris
###195 Yukhananov, one of the founding
###196 fathers of parallel cinema.
###197 We found him at Cine Fantom, which is now a theater but has
###201 been at various times a film festival, a magazine, and a
###205 meeting house where all the parallel cinema directors and
###208 actors would get together and make their films.
###210 [SPEAKING RUSSAN]
###211 
###247 SHANE SMITH: Next, we headed over to see another founding
###249 father of parallel cinema, Gleb Aleinikov.
###254 Gleb and his brother, Igor, made tons of films in
###256 the '80s and '90s.
###257 They're actually probably the most famous and prolific.
###259 [RUSSIAN MARCH]
###268 SHANE SMITH: Igor is dead.
###268 He died in a plane crash.
###270 But Gleb is running the second-largest
###271 TV station in Russia.
###273 So we went there and asked him, how were these crazy
###275 films received?
###276 Who watched them?
###277 And did they have any problems when they
###279 showed them to people?
###280 [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###281 
###304 
###311 [RUSSIAN MUSIC]
###315 SHANE SMITH: The parallel cinema movement and the fine
###317 arts movement happened at the same time in
###319 Russia in the '80s.
###321 And when we were talking to the founding fathers of the
###323 cinema part, they kept on saying, you
###325 have to Oleg Kulik.
###326 You have to talk to Oleg Kulik.
###328 He's a performance artist that was really part of the initial
###331 burst of parallel cinema.
###332 
###339 Famously, he was the dog for a year, where he would go all
###343 around Europe and Russia naked, on a
###345 chain, attacking people.
###347 In fact, he got arrested.
###348 He got arrested in Germany, and Sweden,
###350 and France, and Russia.
###352 
###355 And now he's the Messiah.
###357 He's the Messiah of a new religion,
###359 the religion of nothing.
###360 So we went to go see him.
###362 And let me tell you, his bio and his reputation do not live
###366 up to meeting the man in person.
###368 
###377 Here he is putting his had up a cow's vagina.
###379 Here he is acting as a bird.
###381 Here he is with some pigs.
###383 Horse biting his nipple.
###385 Here he is with a buddy.
###387 [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###388 
###395 SHANE SMITH: And they need a messiah for the new religion?
###399 [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###400 
###420 SHANE SMITH: So the messiah spent the afternoon explaining
###422 his religion to me.
###423 And he showed me all kinds of images, and all kinds of
###426 supporting materials.
###427 And I didn't really get it.
###429 And I left at the end of the afternoon, really in dire need
###433 of a drink.
###434 
###439 We're here in Moscow.
###440 It's cold.
###441 But we're going to go meet Andre Silvestrov, who's one of
###444 followers of alcho cinema, which is cinema of the booze.
###448 
###454 Hello.
###456 How are you?
###457 Shane.
###460 Shane, hi.
###461 Pasha?
###462 Nice to meet you.
###463 
###466 PASHA: Now we start to shoot alcho cinema.
###470 Now, yes, immediately.
###474 SHANE SMITH: And so alcho cinema, is it a movement like
###478 parallel cinema?
###479 Or just defining films that have a lot of alcohol in it?
###482 
###496 [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###497 
###512 SHANE SMITH: So can we make a film with you guys, a parallel
###515 cinema film?
###515 PASHA: OK.
###517 [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###518 
###522 PASHA: You must drink tomorrow.
###523 SHANE SMITH: OK.
###524 I have to go to bed now, then.
###525 PASHA: Good evening.
###527 SHANE SMITH: So we were drunk.
###529 And we were excited.
###530 Because the next day we were going to make some movies.
###532
