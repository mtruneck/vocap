0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:15,221



2
0:0:15,221 --> 0:0:17,88
ZIYAH GAFIC: I don't think
photography's a [INAUDIBLE]


3
0:0:17,88 --> 0:0:18,96
medium.


4
0:0:18,96 --> 0:0:23,87
I see it more as a series of
impressions or constructs


5
0:0:23,87 --> 0:0:25,29
about my personal projects.


6
0:0:25,29 --> 0:0:28,81
I want to see them as open
structure and to allow some


7
0:0:28,81 --> 0:0:31,31
liberty to readers
to draw their own


8
0:0:31,31 --> 0:0:32,702
conclusions about it.


9
0:0:32,702 --> 0:1:9,32



10
0:1:9,32 --> 0:1:11,94
I think that Islamic countries
or Muslim world.


11
0:1:11,94 --> 0:1:15,1
There's a huge number of
stories that are either


12
0:1:15,1 --> 0:1:18,84
untold, or told in a
superficial way.


13
0:1:18,84 --> 0:1:21,24
Coming from a Muslim background
in a country that


14
0:1:21,24 --> 0:1:24,61
has a significant Muslim
community, I just wanted to


15
0:1:24,61 --> 0:1:27,35
try to offer a different
perspective.


16
0:1:27,35 --> 0:1:31,91



17
0:1:31,91 --> 0:1:34,8
Photography for me
was a hobby.


18
0:1:34,8 --> 0:1:39,5
I have no academic background
in photography whatsoever.


19
0:1:39,5 --> 0:1:41,9
I was studying comparative
literature,


20
0:1:41,9 --> 0:1:44,42
that's my formal education.


21
0:1:44,42 --> 0:1:46,84
I want to tell stories.


22
0:1:46,84 --> 0:1:49,64
Here you're using words, the
other place you're using


23
0:1:49,64 --> 0:1:51,825
pictures, but it's basically
the same thing.


24
0:1:51,825 --> 0:1:54,38



25
0:1:54,38 --> 0:1:57,3
During the war years
in Bosnia, I was a


26
0:1:57,3 --> 0:1:58,9
teenager, I was 15.


27
0:1:58,9 --> 0:2:1,91
And I wasn't really able to
take part in what was


28
0:2:1,91 --> 0:2:4,45
happening there, in the events
that were unfolding around me.


29
0:2:4,45 --> 0:2:7,98
Because I was too young to
fight, and I was too young to


30
0:2:7,98 --> 0:2:9,44
be a photographer.


31
0:2:9,44 --> 0:2:13,17
Except of being subject of
those events, which means


32
0:2:13,17 --> 0:2:16,68
basically a target, like
every other citizen.


33
0:2:16,68 --> 0:2:17,93
That was kind of
a frustration.


34
0:2:17,93 --> 0:2:21,64



35
0:2:21,64 --> 0:2:25,44
When I started working
seriously, I was focused on


36
0:2:25,44 --> 0:2:27,98
what was an aftermath of
the war in Bosnia.


37
0:2:27,98 --> 0:2:31,55
Huge part of it is compensation,
maybe even


38
0:2:31,55 --> 0:2:35,71
re-creation of the excitement
and adrenalin rushes that I


39
0:2:35,71 --> 0:2:36,96
was experiencing as a kid.


40
0:2:36,96 --> 0:2:39,56



41
0:2:39,56 --> 0:2:44,61
And as I was completing that
body of work, I realized that


42
0:2:44,61 --> 0:2:47,4
there was a number of places
around the world that had been


43
0:2:47,4 --> 0:2:50,6
following a similar
pattern of ethnic


44
0:2:50,6 --> 0:2:54,63
violence, fraternal wars.


45
0:2:54,63 --> 0:2:56,76
A lot of these places share
one more thing in common,


46
0:2:56,76 --> 0:3:0,94
which is significant
Muslim population.


47
0:3:0,94 --> 0:3:4,46
So I got interested in that,
because I think photography--


48
0:3:4,46 --> 0:3:6,87
for me, it's all
about empathy.


49
0:3:6,87 --> 0:3:11,91
My previous experience actually
allows me to do that.


50
0:3:11,91 --> 0:3:14,63
And that's how the project,
Troubled Islam, developed from


51
0:3:14,63 --> 0:3:16,45
working in Bosnia to
all the countries


52
0:3:16,45 --> 0:3:18,81
all the way to Pakistan.


53
0:3:18,81 --> 0:3:21,18
This is from Pakistan.


54
0:3:21,18 --> 0:3:23,44
The family with the things that
they saved when they were


55
0:3:23,44 --> 0:3:24,99
fleeing the Western Province.


56
0:3:24,99 --> 0:3:32,62



57
0:3:32,62 --> 0:3:34,58
That is one of my favorites.


58
0:3:34,58 --> 0:3:35,83
It's Kabul Cemetery.


59
0:3:35,83 --> 0:3:37,97



60
0:3:37,97 --> 0:3:41,76
It's oxymoron in itself.


61
0:3:41,76 --> 0:3:43,94
I just wanted to make
a comparison


62
0:3:43,94 --> 0:3:44,95
between these countries.


63
0:3:44,95 --> 0:3:48,14
And one of the comparisons was,
obviously, just to see


64
0:3:48,14 --> 0:3:50,18
how people cope.


65
0:3:50,18 --> 0:3:53,63
And how they manage to preserve
the traces of


66
0:3:53,63 --> 0:3:59,75
normality despite all the odds
that are against them.


67
0:3:59,75 --> 0:4:1,8
Comparative method is not
necessarily a very fruitful


68
0:4:1,8 --> 0:4:4,4
method to make conclusions.


69
0:4:4,4 --> 0:4:6,34
I think with images it's
very fruitful.


70
0:4:6,34 --> 0:4:9,38
I mean, if you put things
together, the reader can kind


71
0:4:9,38 --> 0:4:14,96
of make a decision and make
conclusions on their own.


72
0:4:14,96 --> 0:4:17,64
And this is the brand new book
that hasn't been distributed


73
0:4:17,64 --> 0:4:23,82
yet and it's a very
special project.


74
0:4:23,82 --> 0:4:26,49
So I wanted to make something
where my interference as a


75
0:4:26,49 --> 0:4:29,42
photographer, as a human being,
will be minimized.


76
0:4:29,42 --> 0:4:34,79
And I also wanted to make a
project that my subjects might


77
0:4:34,79 --> 0:4:36,74
benefit from.


78
0:4:36,74 --> 0:4:39,47
And the project culminated
in a publication


79
0:4:39,47 --> 0:4:41,88
called Quest for Identity.


80
0:4:41,88 --> 0:4:44,39
About eight years ago, I was
working on a group project.


81
0:4:44,39 --> 0:4:47,81
And as part of that story, I
went to this facility in


82
0:4:47,81 --> 0:4:52,3
central Bosnia which handles
the whole identification


83
0:4:52,3 --> 0:4:54,57
process of missing people in
Bosnia, which is roughly


84
0:4:54,57 --> 0:4:57,11
40,000 people have been
missing or killed.


85
0:4:57,11 --> 0:5:0,14
They have database of DNA
and so on and so forth.


86
0:5:0,14 --> 0:5:4,58
But among other things they also
have storage of archived,


87
0:5:4,58 --> 0:5:7,13
cataloged items.


88
0:5:7,13 --> 0:5:12,3
Personal belongings that had
been recovered along with the


89
0:5:12,3 --> 0:5:13,96
human remains.


90
0:5:13,96 --> 0:5:16,17
What happens, they invite
families and they browse


91
0:5:16,17 --> 0:5:17,6
through these items.


92
0:5:17,6 --> 0:5:19,18
This is a horrible process.


93
0:5:19,18 --> 0:5:22,14
And I said, wait a minute,
wouldn't it be better if these


94
0:5:22,14 --> 0:5:25,55
people actually recognized
these items on the paper


95
0:5:25,55 --> 0:5:28,36
instead of actually physically
having to go to these


96
0:5:28,36 --> 0:5:31,81
facilities and browse?


97
0:5:31,81 --> 0:5:32,83
So that's the project.


98
0:5:32,83 --> 0:5:34,38
So I just had to photograph
these items in


99
0:5:34,38 --> 0:5:35,22
exactly the same way.


100
0:5:35,22 --> 0:5:38,48
On a forensics table on which
the bodies are assembled, and


101
0:5:38,48 --> 0:5:41,74
photographic them in a very
clinical, very detached way.


102
0:5:41,74 --> 0:5:47,7
And to create this book and iPad
app and online catalog of


103
0:5:47,7 --> 0:5:49,55
these items which will
correspond with


104
0:5:49,55 --> 0:5:50,305
the physical archive.


105
0:5:50,305 --> 0:5:52,84



106
0:5:52,84 --> 0:5:56,44
It's amazing how absolute
detachment in form can


107
0:5:56,44 --> 0:5:59,85
actually create an extremely
emotional body of work.


108
0:5:59,85 --> 0:6:3,19
Everyone has a wristwatch,
everyone has family pictures


109
0:6:3,19 --> 0:6:4,24
in their wallet.


110
0:6:4,24 --> 0:6:9,56
It allows you as a reader to
create a story around.


111
0:6:9,56 --> 0:6:12,6
Twenty magazines published that
across the globe, from


112
0:6:12,6 --> 0:6:15,44
Spain, to Holland,
to the States.


113
0:6:15,44 --> 0:6:19,34
And the project was supported by
so many people and so many


114
0:6:19,34 --> 0:6:20,64
organizations.


115
0:6:20,64 --> 0:6:22,98
So I think that's probably
the best thing--


116
0:6:22,98 --> 0:6:24,47
well, not best, but
the most important


117
0:6:24,47 --> 0:6:25,72
thing I've ever done.


118
0:6:25,72 --> 0:6:30,96



119
0:6:30,96 --> 0:6:36,84
I have an assignment from the
Sunday Times Magazine, which


120
0:6:36,84 --> 0:6:41,4
regularly hires me
or runs my work.


121
0:6:41,4 --> 0:6:42,81
And so they gave me
a commission for


122
0:6:42,81 --> 0:6:45,11
this particular story.


123
0:6:45,11 --> 0:6:48,57
We're flying to Riyadh in a few
hours where we'll spend 10


124
0:6:48,57 --> 0:6:53,46
days to shoot a story on
Saudi Arabian women.


125
0:6:53,46 --> 0:6:56,26
So I'm going to do photos, and
I'm going to shoot video


126
0:6:56,26 --> 0:6:57,51
interviews.


127
0:6:57,51 --> 0:7:0,12



128
0:7:0,12 --> 0:7:2,586
I traveled on several occasions
to Saudi Arabia to


129
0:7:2,586 --> 0:7:3,86
do different stories.


130
0:7:3,86 --> 0:7:6,44
It's a place that it's actually
rarely reported from,


131
0:7:6,44 --> 0:7:8,92
considering that it's pretty
difficult to get access to the


132
0:7:8,92 --> 0:7:10,6
country itself.


133
0:7:10,6 --> 0:7:13,36
And every time someone speaks
about Saudi Arabia, that's


134
0:7:13,36 --> 0:7:15,145
what they speak about--
women's rights


135
0:7:15,145 --> 0:7:17,21
to drive, to work.


136
0:7:17,21 --> 0:7:20,97
So it's a good place to
challenge the stereotype.


137
0:7:20,97 --> 0:7:33,38



138
0:7:33,38 --> 0:7:37,37
So we came to Saudi Arabia
in Riyadh, the capital.


139
0:7:37,37 --> 0:7:40,4
Riyadh is a weird city,
I would say.


140
0:7:40,4 --> 0:7:43,9
It's kind of heartland of the
royal family, which is kind of


141
0:7:43,9 --> 0:7:46,75
plateau in the middle
of the country.


142
0:7:46,75 --> 0:7:49,41
I wouldn't call it a beautiful
city, because there's nothing


143
0:7:49,41 --> 0:7:53,48
actually to resemble the fact
that this is one of the oldest


144
0:7:53,48 --> 0:7:55,7
inhabited places on Earth.


145
0:7:55,7 --> 0:7:58,92
Basically all the traces of old
cultures and civilizations


146
0:7:58,92 --> 0:8:0,64
are kind of wiped out.


147
0:8:0,64 --> 0:8:3,66
And instead of that you just
have this eclectic


148
0:8:3,66 --> 0:8:6,89
architecture which combines
super modern American


149
0:8:6,89 --> 0:8:10,64
architecture with some Bedouin
kind of tent-style roofs and


150
0:8:10,64 --> 0:8:11,51
so on and so forth.


151
0:8:11,51 --> 0:8:13,45
So a lot of glass,
a lot of metal.


152
0:8:13,45 --> 0:8:21,14



153
0:8:21,14 --> 0:8:23,77
Yeah, it is a kind of a place
where everything takes place


154
0:8:23,77 --> 0:8:25,43
in the private places.


155
0:8:25,43 --> 0:8:28,13
Either behind the walls
of the houses, or in


156
0:8:28,13 --> 0:8:29,18
the shopping malls--


157
0:8:29,18 --> 0:8:31,88
close quarters, so to speak.


158
0:8:31,88 --> 0:8:35,809
It's because of the heat, and
because of this obsessive need


159
0:8:35,809 --> 0:8:37,24
for privacy.


160
0:8:37,24 --> 0:8:40,53
So nothing really happens
in the streets.


161
0:8:40,53 --> 0:8:43,61
And to make things even more
complicated, Saudi society's


162
0:8:43,61 --> 0:8:44,91
fairly segregated.


163
0:8:44,91 --> 0:8:49,6
I wouldn't call it extreme, but
here it's more visible.


164
0:8:49,6 --> 0:8:51,79
Talking to women in general,
it's not the


165
0:8:51,79 --> 0:8:53,56
easiest thing to do.


166
0:8:53,56 --> 0:8:56,64
And especially when it comes to
talking to camera or taking


167
0:8:56,64 --> 0:8:59,22
pictures that are going to
be published abroad.


168
0:8:59,22 --> 0:9:2,27



169
0:9:2,27 --> 0:9:5,37
It's a traditional culture,
it's sensitive.


170
0:9:5,37 --> 0:9:9,26
So as usual, I rely on local
knowledge and local


171
0:9:9,26 --> 0:9:9,96
connections.


172
0:9:9,96 --> 0:9:10,916
Good, yeah?


173
0:9:10,916 --> 0:9:12,35
FAHMI FARAHAT: Absolutely,
ready.


174
0:9:12,35 --> 0:9:13,71
Rock and roll.


175
0:9:13,71 --> 0:9:16,27
ZIYAH GAFIC: Because no matter
how many times to travel to a


176
0:9:16,27 --> 0:9:19,63
certain place, your knowledge of
culture and how things work


177
0:9:19,63 --> 0:9:22,51
is fairly limited.


178
0:9:22,51 --> 0:9:25,25
We hired a local production
company.


179
0:9:25,25 --> 0:9:28,57
They have a lot of experience
in dealing with people.


180
0:9:28,57 --> 0:9:31,88
I made specific demands of what
kind of women I would


181
0:9:31,88 --> 0:9:32,77
like to meet.


182
0:9:32,77 --> 0:9:35,77
The local production company
basically sorted it all out.


183
0:9:35,77 --> 0:9:38,77
FAHMI FARAHAT: Ladies.


184
0:9:38,77 --> 0:9:40,61
It's what I do for a living
now, fixing ladies.


185
0:9:40,61 --> 0:9:47,85



186
0:9:47,85 --> 0:9:50,95
ZIYAH GAFIC: I think there's a
general feeling that Muslim


187
0:9:50,95 --> 0:9:54,2
women in general, and Saudi
woman in particular, is


188
0:9:54,2 --> 0:9:57,36
somehow put in the backseat
of the society.


189
0:9:57,36 --> 0:10:0,12
That picture is very fragmented
and largely


190
0:10:0,12 --> 0:10:1,79
inaccurate.


191
0:10:1,79 --> 0:10:5,66
So I'd like to get kind of a
cross section of Saudi women


192
0:10:5,66 --> 0:10:10,11
and to try to photograph them
and interview them in their


193
0:10:10,11 --> 0:10:14,74
private spaces or their
working space.


194
0:10:14,74 --> 0:10:15,1
That way?


195
0:10:15,1 --> 0:10:16,35
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


196
0:10:16,35 --> 0:10:18,299



197
0:10:18,299 --> 0:10:20,35
DR. BOTHYNA MURSHID: In Saudi
Arabia when we go


198
0:10:20,35 --> 0:10:22,596
out, we wear abaya.


199
0:10:22,596 --> 0:10:26,52
Abaya, it's different from
region to region.


200
0:10:26,52 --> 0:10:31,45
Here in Riyadh, we wear
mainly black.


201
0:10:31,45 --> 0:10:35,46
For every occasion, we do have
different kind of abaya.


202
0:10:35,46 --> 0:10:38,16
Fashion designer, they
would have a business


203
0:10:38,16 --> 0:10:40,24
only to sell abaya.


204
0:10:40,24 --> 0:10:42,85
And women they, of course, are
like oh, I'm wearing this


205
0:10:42,85 --> 0:10:45,22
designer, I'm wearing that.


206
0:10:45,22 --> 0:10:49,1
So yes, abaya, it's part
of the fashion now.


207
0:10:49,1 --> 0:10:52,15
My name is Bothyna
Zakarea Murshid.


208
0:10:52,15 --> 0:10:55,72
I had my doctorate from Yale
University in management of


209
0:10:55,72 --> 0:11:1,12
chronic illness, which is
sub-speciality from doctorate


210
0:11:1,12 --> 0:11:3,28
in clinical research.


211
0:11:3,28 --> 0:11:6,1
ZIYAH GAFIC: Whenever we are
talking about Muslim woman,


212
0:11:6,1 --> 0:11:8,54
Saudi Arabia's always picked
up as a bad example.


213
0:11:8,54 --> 0:11:11,49
But actually, statistically,
women in Saudi Arabia are more


214
0:11:11,49 --> 0:11:12,97
educated than men.


215
0:11:12,97 --> 0:11:16,73
There are more women with
college degrees, or MAs and


216
0:11:16,73 --> 0:11:19,226
BAs and PhDs, than men.


217
0:11:19,226 --> 0:11:22,5
If the issue that we are dealing
with is that Muslim


218
0:11:22,5 --> 0:11:25,88
woman are underrepresented in
the media, then I want to


219
0:11:25,88 --> 0:11:29,45
dedicate my attention to her.


220
0:11:29,45 --> 0:11:30,922
Can you move a little
bit that way?


221
0:11:30,922 --> 0:11:32,31
Yeah, perfect.


222
0:11:32,31 --> 0:11:33,9
That's why portraits
seemed like an


223
0:11:33,9 --> 0:11:36,72
appropriate way to do it.


224
0:11:36,72 --> 0:11:40,23
I wanted to give certain formal
values to the picture.


225
0:11:40,23 --> 0:11:43,15
So I'd like to be accurately
composed.


226
0:11:43,15 --> 0:11:52,31



227
0:11:52,31 --> 0:11:55,1
After all these years of being
a photographer, I don't get


228
0:11:55,1 --> 0:11:56,68
easily surprised.


229
0:11:56,68 --> 0:12:0,65
But what keeps surprising me
every single time I get out in


230
0:12:0,65 --> 0:12:3,61
the field and photograph is
how people are willing to


231
0:12:3,61 --> 0:12:5,9
allow photographers to enter
their private space.


232
0:12:5,9 --> 0:12:8,74
I think that's pretty amazing
in any country.


233
0:12:8,74 --> 0:12:11,4
And also in a country like Saudi
Arabia where everything


234
0:12:11,4 --> 0:12:13,11
is so private anyways.


235
0:12:13,11 --> 0:12:16,78
Somehow there's this implied
trust between a subject and a


236
0:12:16,78 --> 0:12:18,806
photographer.


237
0:12:18,806 --> 0:12:20,7
So you have a cupcake store?


238
0:12:20,7 --> 0:12:22,63
BASSMA ALHAMMAD: It's
not ours, we're


239
0:12:22,63 --> 0:12:24,61
only opening the franchise.


240
0:12:24,61 --> 0:12:26,89
But the original
was in Dammam.


241
0:12:26,89 --> 0:12:30,24
It was founded by
a Saudi female--


242
0:12:30,24 --> 0:12:32,63
it was very successful.


243
0:12:32,63 --> 0:12:35,14
It's all cupcakes, and
they covered over


244
0:12:35,14 --> 0:12:38,16
with the green cream.


245
0:12:38,16 --> 0:12:41,18
About the Saudi women in
general, a lot of people think


246
0:12:41,18 --> 0:12:42,852
they're pampered.


247
0:12:42,852 --> 0:12:47,45
But the truth is no,
they're very active


248
0:12:47,45 --> 0:12:49,0
but behind the scenes.


249
0:12:49,0 --> 0:12:52,21
They're mothers, they're
housewives, they work, they


250
0:12:52,21 --> 0:12:53,84
study at the same time.


251
0:12:53,84 --> 0:12:57,25
A full job, also they're
starting their own business.


252
0:12:57,25 --> 0:12:59,82
Recently I can see they're
achieving a lot.


253
0:12:59,82 --> 0:13:2,772



254
0:13:2,772 --> 0:13:3,94
ZIYAH GAFIC: On the
other hand, yeah,


255
0:13:3,94 --> 0:13:5,28
they're beautiful women.


256
0:13:5,28 --> 0:13:7,9
That's also another thing that
we are not aware of.


257
0:13:7,9 --> 0:13:10,36
Because most of the images you
see are the images from the


258
0:13:10,36 --> 0:13:13,99
street where they are obliged to
cover either part of their


259
0:13:13,99 --> 0:13:15,89
body or most of their
body and face.


260
0:13:15,89 --> 0:13:21,47



261
0:13:21,47 --> 0:13:27,86
This was a more controlled
environment where I would


262
0:13:27,86 --> 0:13:31,19
choose which part of the room or
house plays the person the


263
0:13:31,19 --> 0:13:33,8
way I would like.


264
0:13:33,8 --> 0:13:35,38
What I wanted to create
is this kind of simple


265
0:13:35,38 --> 0:13:37,45
environmental portraits.


266
0:13:37,45 --> 0:13:41,0
And the context, in this case
environment and private


267
0:13:41,0 --> 0:13:45,26
spaces, actually tell much more
than just the figure or


268
0:13:45,26 --> 0:13:46,51
the face of the person.


269
0:13:46,51 --> 0:13:55,75



270
0:13:55,75 --> 0:13:59,75
The story about Islam is a
relevant one, globally.


271
0:13:59,75 --> 0:14:2,36
I think it's been widely
inaccurately


272
0:14:2,36 --> 0:14:3,92
represented in the media.


273
0:14:3,92 --> 0:14:5,97
That it's tried to be presented
as a conflict


274
0:14:5,97 --> 0:14:8,5
between East and West and
between Christianity and


275
0:14:8,5 --> 0:14:11,22
Islam, and I think that's
really dangerous.


276
0:14:11,22 --> 0:14:15,19
So it's on us to shift
that image.


277
0:14:15,19 --> 0:14:16,45
[SPEAKING ARABIC]


278
0:14:16,45 --> 0:14:34,675



279
0:14:34,675 --> 0:14:36,785
ZIYAH GAFIC: Oh, wow.


280
0:14:36,785 --> 0:14:37,7
Jesus.


281
0:14:37,7 --> 0:14:38,32
[SPEAKING ARABIC]


282
0:14:38,32 --> 0:15:19,852



283
0:15:19,852 --> 0:15:23,47
ZIYAH GAFIC: All of the women we
met, they all work and they


284
0:15:23,47 --> 0:15:25,8
all have college degrees.


285
0:15:25,8 --> 0:15:30,96
And equally so, I'm sure there's
a bunch of women who


286
0:15:30,96 --> 0:15:33,0
are not educated and
are out of work.


287
0:15:33,0 --> 0:15:35,48
But I'm just talking about
what I've seen.


288
0:15:35,48 --> 0:15:38,4
And obviously, we've seen only a
small fraction of it, so I'm


289
0:15:38,4 --> 0:15:41,25
not claiming that we have
the whole picture.


290
0:15:41,25 --> 0:15:44,53
But I think it's important to do
stories that are showing at


291
0:15:44,53 --> 0:15:49,5
least slightly a different
side of the coin.


292
0:15:49,5 --> 0:15:49,61
Nice to meet you.


293
0:15:49,61 --> 0:15:50,5
How are you?


294
0:15:50,5 --> 0:15:51,56
Nice to meet you.


295
0:15:51,56 --> 0:15:56,28
With photographers somehow, a
lot of us try to please the


296
0:15:56,28 --> 0:15:57,63
stereotypes.


297
0:15:57,63 --> 0:16:0,7
We put the blame on yeah, that's
what the media wants.


298
0:16:0,7 --> 0:16:3,36
That's what the people
want to see.


299
0:16:3,36 --> 0:16:5,97
How do we know what people
want to see?


300
0:16:5,97 --> 0:16:9,31
I can only listen to
the common sense.


301
0:16:9,31 --> 0:16:11,73
If I was the reader, what
I would like to read?


302
0:16:11,73 --> 0:16:13,87
So this is what I would
like to read.


303
0:16:13,87 --> 0:16:16,21
So I do the stories that
I would like to see


304
0:16:16,21 --> 0:16:17,46
someone else do.


305
0:16:17,46 --> 0:18:17,46
