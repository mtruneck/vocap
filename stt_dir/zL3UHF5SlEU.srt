0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:12,18



2
0:0:12,18 --> 0:0:13,23
THOMAS MORTON: We're
in Uganda.


3
0:0:13,23 --> 0:0:15,43
Uganda's had a pretty good spell
the last 25 years-- no


4
0:0:15,43 --> 0:0:17,97
major civil wars, a little bit
of an Ebola outbreak every so


5
0:0:17,97 --> 0:0:19,54
often, including right now.


6
0:0:19,54 --> 0:0:21,72
And they're the alcoholism
capital of Africa.


7
0:0:21,72 --> 0:0:24,54



8
0:0:24,54 --> 0:0:27,82
One favorite type of booze the
locals make is called waragi.


9
0:0:27,82 --> 0:0:30,155
We're going to go make
some, drink some, and


10
0:0:30,155 --> 0:0:31,405
hopefully not go blind.


11
0:0:31,405 --> 0:1:2,38



12
0:1:2,38 --> 0:1:5,459
In 2004, the World Health
Organization released its


13
0:1:5,459 --> 0:1:8,26
global status report on alcohol
and health, finding


14
0:1:8,26 --> 0:1:10,87
Uganda as the top contender
for per capita alcohol


15
0:1:10,87 --> 0:1:12,18
consumption in the world.


16
0:1:12,18 --> 0:1:15,55
Since 2011, the numbers
have only increased.


17
0:1:15,55 --> 0:1:20,77
Basically, making Uganda the
drunkest place on earth.


18
0:1:20,77 --> 0:1:22,7
So when Vice heard about
Uganda's countrywide


19
0:1:22,7 --> 0:1:24,915
production of a type of
moonshine called for waragi,


20
0:1:24,915 --> 0:1:27,55
we were interested.


21
0:1:27,55 --> 0:1:30,26
But after we discovered that
people were going blind and


22
0:1:30,26 --> 0:1:33,51
dying for drinking waragi cut
with industrial chemicals, we


23
0:1:33,51 --> 0:1:36,14
knew this was something we
needed to taste for ourselves.


24
0:1:36,14 --> 0:1:38,21
Making its way through
my system.


25
0:1:38,21 --> 0:1:40,94
I can feel it kind
of spreading out.


26
0:1:40,94 --> 0:1:42,95
Following the release of the
World Health Organization's


27
0:1:42,95 --> 0:1:46,41
report, the administration of
President Yoweri Museveni,


28
0:1:46,41 --> 0:1:48,4
acting through Uganda's
Parliament, ordered a


29
0:1:48,4 --> 0:1:50,0
commission to be formed
to fact check


30
0:1:50,0 --> 0:1:51,45
the report's findings.


31
0:1:51,45 --> 0:1:53,49
If you're wondering what
prompted a reaction that seems


32
0:1:53,49 --> 0:1:56,27
like the geopolitical equivalent
of an angry work


33
0:1:56,27 --> 0:1:57,675
email, here's some context.


34
0:1:57,675 --> 0:2:1,6



35
0:2:1,6 --> 0:2:4,71
Musevini has been president
of Uganda for 27 years.


36
0:2:4,71 --> 0:2:6,93
He came to power after fighting
a six year bush war


37
0:2:6,93 --> 0:2:11,8
against this guy, who had been
president from 1966 to 1971,


38
0:2:11,8 --> 0:2:13,4
before being ousted
in a coup by this


39
0:2:13,4 --> 0:2:15,6
guy, who was a sociopath.


40
0:2:15,6 --> 0:2:18,35
This guy gave himself lots of
medals, royal titles, and


41
0:2:18,35 --> 0:2:21,62
ruled with an iron fist until
he was deposed by this guy,


42
0:2:21,62 --> 0:2:24,53
who was then president again
until he lost a civil war


43
0:2:24,53 --> 0:2:26,88
against the National Resistance
Movement, led by


44
0:2:26,88 --> 0:2:28,83
our old pal, Museveni.


45
0:2:28,83 --> 0:2:32,28
Running up to Uganda's 2006
election, Museveni and the now


46
0:2:32,28 --> 0:2:34,64
political National Resistance
Movement abolished


47
0:2:34,64 --> 0:2:36,32
presidential term limits.


48
0:2:36,32 --> 0:2:38,96
On top of that, Museveni's been
lying about his age for


49
0:2:38,96 --> 0:2:41,92
five or six-odd years in order
to avoid the maximum age for


50
0:2:41,92 --> 0:2:43,895
the presidency stipulated in
the country's constitution.


51
0:2:43,895 --> 0:2:46,46



52
0:2:46,46 --> 0:2:49,15
So when the commission put in
place by Uganda's parliament


53
0:2:49,15 --> 0:2:51,63
to investigate just how drunk
they were at the international


54
0:2:51,63 --> 0:2:54,41
office party made the decision
to appoint Doctor Kabann


55
0:2:54,41 --> 0:2:57,11
Kabananukye, Professor of
Makerere University, and


56
0:2:57,11 --> 0:2:59,42
director of the Victor
Rehabilitation Center to head


57
0:2:59,42 --> 0:3:1,53
up the commission,
it struck us is


58
0:3:1,53 --> 0:3:3,85
uncharacteristically sober.


59
0:3:3,85 --> 0:3:7,8
What is Ugandans' relationship
with alcohol like?


60
0:3:7,8 --> 0:3:8,4
Do a lot of people drink here?


61
0:3:8,4 --> 0:3:33,35



62
0:3:33,35 --> 0:3:35,67
The more we talk to people about
the subject, the more we


63
0:3:35,67 --> 0:3:38,53
begin to understand not only the
extent of Uganda's issue


64
0:3:38,53 --> 0:3:41,26
with libations, but also just
how different the problem


65
0:3:41,26 --> 0:3:43,38
manifested itself in different
parts of the country.


66
0:3:43,38 --> 0:3:46,64



67
0:3:46,64 --> 0:3:48,99
So we headed out of the city,
40 kilometers up into the


68
0:3:48,99 --> 0:3:50,98
hills above Kampala,
to a village in the


69
0:3:50,98 --> 0:3:52,23
rural Kaliro district.


70
0:3:52,23 --> 0:4:30,1



71
0:4:30,1 --> 0:4:31,26
Thank you.


72
0:4:31,26 --> 0:4:57,58



73
0:4:57,58 --> 0:5:0,63
Where do you guys make
the waragi here?


74
0:5:0,63 --> 0:5:3,63



75
0:5:3,63 --> 0:5:4,9
Cool.


76
0:5:4,9 --> 0:5:5,995
So is this somebody's house?


77
0:5:5,995 --> 0:5:25,9



78
0:5:25,9 --> 0:5:28,27
This is the waragi hut, huh?


79
0:5:28,27 --> 0:5:30,1
And you're the one
who makes it?


80
0:5:30,1 --> 0:5:32,24
Can she explain what's
happening here?


81
0:5:32,24 --> 0:5:36,43



82

MISTRESS KALIRO:

83

THOMAS MORTON: So it's
your basic still.


84
0:5:46,39 --> 0:5:48,17
You've got the mash in there.


85
0:5:48,17 --> 0:5:49,64
It's boiling and fermenting.


86
0:5:49,64 --> 0:5:51,94
The vapor from it comes up
through these copper tubes,


87
0:5:51,94 --> 0:5:52,83
then condenses.


88
0:5:52,83 --> 0:5:55,48
You cool it off there, and it
drips into this gas tank.

0:6:20,9 --> 0:6:29,835



93
0:6:29,835 --> 0:6:32,167
Seem like it might be strong.


94
0:6:32,167 --> 0:6:33,417
Eh?


95
0:6:33,417 --> 0:6:39,48



96
0:6:39,48 --> 0:6:43,31
Yeah, that tastes like liquor.


97
0:6:43,31 --> 0:6:46,14
It's actually pretty smooth.


98
0:6:46,14 --> 0:6:48,24
This tastes really
clean and fresh.


99

if I kill this really quick?

Thank you.


104
0:7:16,87 --> 0:7:20,25



105
0:7:20,25 --> 0:7:23,35
A native language corruption of
the English phrase War Gin,


106
0:7:23,35 --> 0:7:25,83
waragi was originally contrived
to embolden Ugandan


107
0:7:25,83 --> 0:7:28,29
soldiers in the King's East
Africa Rifles during World


108
0:7:28,29 --> 0:7:31,39
Wars I and II with what the
British cheekily referred to


109
0:7:31,39 --> 0:7:33,19
as Dutch courage.


110
0:7:33,19 --> 0:7:35,4
Much to the colonial governor's
chagrin, the


111
0:7:35,4 --> 0:7:37,5
beverage later became the drink
of choice for those


112
0:7:37,5 --> 0:7:39,93
resisting the crown during the
drive for independence in the


113
0:7:39,93 --> 0:7:57,588
late 1950s and early 1960s.


114
0:7:57,588 --> 0:7:59,116
It's up from the store house.

It's even better.

You can kind of taste of the
banana more with that one when


120
0:8:17,655 --> 0:8:18,58
it's cooled down.


121
0:8:18,58 --> 0:8:22,96

make waragi more than men?
