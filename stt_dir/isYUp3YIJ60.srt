2
0:0:4,37 --> 0:0:8,7
TED SOUTHERN: A space suit is
an enclosure to protect a


3
0:0:8,7 --> 0:0:12,46
human being from the extreme
environments of space.


4
0:0:12,46 --> 0:0:15,91
The classic way of talking
about an EVA suit is a


5
0:0:15,91 --> 0:0:19,4
spaceship for one.


6
0:0:19,4 --> 0:0:23,64
So how is it possible for two
guys to make space suits that


7
0:0:23,64 --> 0:0:27,24
historically have been built
by whole teams of people?


8
0:0:27,24 --> 0:0:28,39
How is it possible?


9
0:0:28,39 --> 0:0:29,932
Maybe we shouldn't
be doing this.


10
0:0:29,932 --> 0:0:51,4



11
0:0:51,4 --> 0:0:52,84
My name is Ted Southern.


12
0:0:52,84 --> 0:0:56,98
We are here at the Final
Frontier Design studio.


13
0:0:56,98 --> 0:1:32,61



14
0:1:32,61 --> 0:1:33,86
NIK MOISEEV: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


15
0:1:33,86 --> 0:2:50,94



16
0:2:50,94 --> 0:2:53,27
TED SOUTHERN: I moved to New
York and told people I wanted


17
0:2:53,27 --> 0:2:55,77
to make body armor for a living,
and that was really my


18
0:2:55,77 --> 0:2:57,18
goal in life.


19
0:2:57,18 --> 0:3:0,74
And I was lucky, within about a
year of living here, to find


20
0:3:0,74 --> 0:3:5,32
a costume shop, Izquierdo
Studios in Chelsea, that


21
0:3:5,32 --> 0:3:6,95
actually did make body armor.


22
0:3:6,95 --> 0:3:9,77
And 10 years at Izquierdo Studio
taught me a lot of


23
0:3:9,77 --> 0:3:12,81
different things about a lot
of different materials.


24
0:3:12,81 --> 0:3:16,4
I still do costuming
now independently.


25
0:3:16,4 --> 0:3:18,8
I got started making wings for
Victoria's Secret, and I'm


26
0:3:18,8 --> 0:3:20,5
still doing that now.


27
0:3:20,5 --> 0:3:25,13



28
0:3:25,13 --> 0:3:29,17
I actually see a lot of
commonality between costuming


29
0:3:29,17 --> 0:3:30,295
and space suits.


30
0:3:30,295 --> 0:3:32,165
You're obviously building
for the human body.


31
0:3:32,165 --> 0:3:34,52
You want something to be
comfortable and functional.


32
0:3:34,52 --> 0:3:37,78
I suppose, on paper, I would be
the creative one coming up


33
0:3:37,78 --> 0:3:40,52
with crazy ideas and Nik
would keep me in line.


34
0:3:40,52 --> 0:3:42,83
But sometimes it's the
other way around.


35
0:3:42,83 --> 0:3:46,19
With space suits, it's
a longer process.


36
0:3:46,19 --> 0:3:48,54
There's generally a little bit
more money involved, a little


37
0:3:48,54 --> 0:3:50,15
bit higher technology.


38
0:3:50,15 --> 0:3:53,64
But I really see it as a
continuum, and there's a great


39
0:3:53,64 --> 0:3:55,52
deal of relation.


40
0:3:55,52 --> 0:4:0,33
And Nik and I were competitors
in the 2007 Astronaut Glove


41
0:4:0,33 --> 0:4:3,59
Competition, which is part of
NASA's Centennial Challenges,


42
0:4:3,59 --> 0:4:5,89
sort of like the X PRIZES.


43
0:4:5,89 --> 0:4:9,32
The challenge was to redesign
a space suit glove to have


44
0:4:9,32 --> 0:4:11,93
lower torque and higher mobility
than NASA's current


45
0:4:11,93 --> 0:4:13,18
technology.


46
0:4:13,18 --> 0:4:16,48



47
0:4:16,48 --> 0:4:18,88
With the glove, it's been
a consistent problem.


48
0:4:18,88 --> 0:4:21,51
It's sort of the weak point of
design for a space suit.


49
0:4:21,51 --> 0:4:24,88
It is the most functional part
of the suit, and a critical


50
0:4:24,88 --> 0:4:27,886
part of astronaut efficiency.


51
0:4:27,886 --> 0:4:30,73
Neither one of us won in 2007.


52
0:4:30,73 --> 0:4:33,39
And I gave you a ride
back to New York


53
0:4:33,39 --> 0:4:34,795
City afterwards, right?


54
0:4:34,795 --> 0:4:36,41
NIK MOISEEV: Right.


55
0:4:36,41 --> 0:4:37,725
TED SOUTHERN: And kind
of never thought I


56
0:4:37,725 --> 0:4:39,7
would see him again.


57
0:4:39,7 --> 0:4:43,16
But he kept in touch through
email, and we decided to


58
0:4:43,16 --> 0:4:48,66
become partners for the 2009
Astronaut Glove Competition.


59
0:4:48,66 --> 0:4:51,835
And we outperformed NASA's
current technology and won


60
0:4:51,835 --> 0:4:52,36
some money.


61
0:4:52,36 --> 0:4:57,99
We won second place and formed
an LLC from there.


62
0:4:57,99 --> 0:5:0,51
So here at Final Frontier
Design, we are working


63
0:5:0,51 --> 0:5:2,59
specifically on IVA suits now.


64
0:5:2,59 --> 0:5:6,22
We're trying to meet a market
demand in the new commercial


65
0:5:6,22 --> 0:5:8,86
space industry for launch
and reentry suits.


66
0:5:8,86 --> 0:5:24,46



67
0:5:24,46 --> 0:5:27,145
TED SOUTHERN: This is a vacuum
chamber glove box.


68
0:5:27,145 --> 0:5:30,49
It pulls pressure out from
inside this chamber and mimics


69
0:5:30,49 --> 0:5:34,6
that pressure differential you
would have inside a suit.


70
0:5:34,6 --> 0:5:36,54
The gloves are obviously really
important to test on


71
0:5:36,54 --> 0:5:41,0
their own as much as possible,
because it really is the human


72
0:5:41,0 --> 0:5:42,215
interaction with space.


73
0:5:42,215 --> 0:5:45,84
It's how humans get work done,
is with their hands.


74
0:5:45,84 --> 0:5:50,36
But we can go in here and try
different tests for dexterity.


75
0:5:50,36 --> 0:5:52,48
One of the ones that I
think is particularly


76
0:5:52,48 --> 0:5:54,26
hard is this peg board.


77
0:5:54,26 --> 0:5:58,31
Last time I was at the Johnson
Space Center, we used their


78
0:5:58,31 --> 0:6:0,77
vacuum chamber glove box,
and inside they


79
0:6:0,77 --> 0:6:2,24
had a Rubik's cube.


80
0:6:2,24 --> 0:6:5,534
So I felt like I needed a
Rubik's cube in my vacuum


81
0:6:5,534 --> 0:6:7,53
chamber as well.


82
0:6:7,53 --> 0:6:11,61
So this is what we call the
Frontier Prime, it's our first


83
0:6:11,61 --> 0:6:13,25
full-body pressure garment.


84
0:6:13,25 --> 0:6:16,66
This suit was a collaboration
between the two of us, Nikolay


85
0:6:16,66 --> 0:6:18,11
built the outer garment.


86
0:6:18,11 --> 0:6:20,12
So this is what we call
the 2G suit, the


87
0:6:20,12 --> 0:6:21,88
second generation suit.


88
0:6:21,88 --> 0:6:25,28
The real advantage of this suit
is it's almost entirely


89
0:6:25,28 --> 0:6:26,53
single layer.


90
0:6:26,53 --> 0:6:30,6



91
0:6:30,6 --> 0:6:33,39
So it is a challenge for two
guys to be making space suits


92
0:6:33,39 --> 0:6:34,71
when historically it's been the


93
0:6:34,71 --> 0:6:37,4
dominion of crews of engineers.


94
0:6:37,4 --> 0:6:43,51



95
0:6:43,51 --> 0:6:46,85
But we've made a lot of
accomplishments so far.


96
0:6:46,85 --> 0:6:49,3
Obviously, we started with
gloves, which are one of the


97
0:6:49,3 --> 0:6:52,22
most specific and heavy-designed
parts of a


98
0:6:52,22 --> 0:6:53,64
space suit.


99
0:6:53,64 --> 0:6:57,23
And we've made a great deal of
improvements over the years in


100
0:6:57,23 --> 0:7:0,26
not just our gloves, but
obviously we've moved on to a


101
0:7:0,26 --> 0:7:0,93
whole suit.


102
0:7:0,93 --> 0:7:4,17
We're testing at levels that
NASA tests at, as far as


103
0:7:4,17 --> 0:7:6,836
leakage rates, as far as range
of motion, as far as cycling,


104
0:7:6,836 --> 0:7:8,86
as far as torque.


105
0:7:8,86 --> 0:7:10,99



106
0:7:10,99 --> 0:7:33,17



107
0:7:33,17 --> 0:7:34,11
TED SOUTHERN: It's low weight.


108
0:7:34,11 --> 0:7:39,54
It's low mass, which is a huge
driver in space travel.


109
0:7:39,54 --> 0:7:41,3
There are generally considered
to be two


110
0:7:41,3 --> 0:7:42,82
kinds of space suits.


111
0:7:42,82 --> 0:7:46,53
One is an IVA suit, which is
sort of a launch, reentry, and


112
0:7:46,53 --> 0:7:47,66
docking suit.


113
0:7:47,66 --> 0:7:49,243
IVA is Intra-Vehicular
Activity.


114
0:7:49,243 --> 0:7:52,48



115
0:7:52,48 --> 0:7:56,5
The EVA suits, Extra-Vehicular
Activity, are a lot more


116
0:7:56,5 --> 0:7:56,76
complicated.


117
0:7:56,76 --> 0:8:0,61
They have life support generally
on their back.


118
0:8:0,61 --> 0:8:3,9
They have enclosures over the
pressure garment that protect


119
0:8:3,9 --> 0:8:5,33
from thermal extremes,


120
0:8:5,33 --> 0:8:8,92
micrometeoroids, sometimes radiation.


121
0:8:8,92 --> 0:8:11,83
Even before Americans were
going to space, they were


122
0:8:11,83 --> 0:8:14,41
going to very high altitudes
where they needed protection


123
0:8:14,41 --> 0:8:16,79
from the extreme environment.


124
0:8:16,79 --> 0:8:20,28
And I think the most classic
case of-- the pioneer of that


125
0:8:20,28 --> 0:8:23,74
is Wiley Post.


126
0:8:23,74 --> 0:8:27,9
He's an early aviator who did
a lot of experience with


127
0:8:27,9 --> 0:8:27,99
pressure garments.


128
0:8:27,99 --> 0:8:30,74
He had a distinct advantage
because he only had one eye,


129
0:8:30,74 --> 0:8:34,74
so he could turn the visor of
his helmet to one side and get


130
0:8:34,74 --> 0:8:36,13
good peripheral vision.


131
0:8:36,13 --> 0:8:39,1
He used pretty crude and
rudimentary things-- squirrel


132
0:8:39,1 --> 0:8:44,15
fur and really thick rubber and
very restricted mobility--


133
0:8:44,15 --> 0:8:49,83
and was very dependent on the
capsule that he was in.


134
0:8:49,83 --> 0:8:51,8
NIK MOISEEV: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


135
0:8:51,8 --> 0:9:17,3



136
0:9:17,3 --> 0:9:20,4
TED SOUTHERN: Obviously, with
NASA, space suits improved


137
0:9:20,4 --> 0:9:21,5
quite a bit.


138
0:9:21,5 --> 0:9:25,5
The Mercury suits were much
more anthropomorphic and


139
0:9:25,5 --> 0:9:30,716
functional, but we didn't
see EVA until Gemini.


140
0:9:30,716 --> 0:9:34,89
The Apollo suits that went to
the Moon were even a great


141
0:9:34,89 --> 0:9:37,35
deal more functional than the
Gemini suits who only saw


142
0:9:37,35 --> 0:9:39,318
limited EVA.


143
0:9:39,318 --> 0:9:41,7
-I like to skip along.


144
0:9:41,7 --> 0:9:42,18
-Not me, boy.


145
0:9:42,18 --> 0:9:42,892
Skip.


146
0:9:42,892 --> 0:9:44,47
-Well, whatever you call it.


147
0:9:44,47 --> 0:9:47,28



148
0:9:47,28 --> 0:9:48,53
NIK MOISEEV: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


149
0:9:48,53 --> 0:10:7,36



150
0:10:7,36 --> 0:10:10,26
TED SOUTHERN: Today's current
EMU has a really


151
0:10:10,26 --> 0:10:12,9
long lifespan on orbit.


152
0:10:12,9 --> 0:10:17,62
It's capable of 8 to 10 hour
EVAs, through a great variety


153
0:10:17,62 --> 0:10:18,78
of sizes of people.


154
0:10:18,78 --> 0:10:21,6
There are females and males
who are doing work


155
0:10:21,6 --> 0:10:22,57
in space suits now.


156
0:10:22,57 --> 0:10:27,53
So it's come a long way since
Wiley Post for sure.


157
0:10:27,53 --> 0:10:29,624
-Wave for the camera.


158
0:10:29,624 --> 0:10:31,456
That's good.


159
0:10:31,456 --> 0:10:31,92
All right.


160
0:10:31,92 --> 0:10:33,17
NIK MOISEEV: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


161
0:10:33,17 --> 0:10:42,65



162
0:10:42,65 --> 0:10:44,14
TED SOUTHERN: So I'm pretty
excited about the waist belt.


163
0:10:44,14 --> 0:10:46,628
We really need to
work on that.


164
0:10:46,628 --> 0:10:48,436
NIK MOISEEV: I am
so hungry that--


165
0:10:48,436 --> 0:10:49,1
TED SOUTHERN: Are you hungry?


166
0:10:49,1 --> 0:10:50,83
But we just ate.


167
0:10:50,83 --> 0:10:54,83
So in June of this year, June
of 2012, we launched a


168
0:10:54,83 --> 0:10:59,71
Kickstarter campaign to help
us support our new company,


169
0:10:59,71 --> 0:11:3,45
and to really sort of announce
that we're ready to build a


170
0:11:3,45 --> 0:11:5,35
flight-certified suit.


171
0:11:5,35 --> 0:11:8,31
So thank you for your
Kickstarter support.


172
0:11:8,31 --> 0:11:8,79
All right.


173
0:11:8,79 --> 0:11:11,67
NIK MOISEEV: Give me five.


174
0:11:11,67 --> 0:11:12,51
TED SOUTHERN: We were
successful.


175
0:11:12,51 --> 0:11:14,37
We reached our funding goals.


176
0:11:14,37 --> 0:11:17,6
But I think more importantly
than that, we got customers.


177
0:11:17,6 --> 0:11:18,12
We got press.


178
0:11:18,12 --> 0:11:21,75
We got people aware
of our project.


179
0:11:21,75 --> 0:11:24,71
We are working now with
Zero2Infinity, which is, as I


180
0:11:24,71 --> 0:11:27,88
mentioned, the Spanish
high-altitude balloon company.


181
0:11:27,88 --> 0:11:31,82
I think it'll give a lot of
validation to work at altitude


182
0:11:31,82 --> 0:11:34,86
and to test these suits in
flight before they start going


183
0:11:34,86 --> 0:11:36,1
on rockets.


184
0:11:36,1 --> 0:11:38,0
So we're really excited
be working with them.


185
0:11:38,0 --> 0:11:52,5



186
0:11:52,5 --> 0:11:56,89
It's exciting for us to be
around in this time where the


187
0:11:56,89 --> 0:12:0,1
commercial industry is just
starting to exist.


188
0:12:0,1 --> 0:12:4,68
I think there's a lot of very
optimistic people saying next


189
0:12:4,68 --> 0:12:6,29
year we'll fly.


190
0:12:6,29 --> 0:12:9,22
It's a long wait, but I think
it's really exciting that it's


191
0:12:9,22 --> 0:12:10,6
actually happening.


192
0:12:10,6 --> 0:12:12,18
And I think once the industry
gains a little bit of


193
0:12:12,18 --> 0:12:15,25
traction, it will really
expand quite quickly.


194
0:12:15,25 --> 0:12:25,22



195
0:12:25,22 --> 0:12:29,78
It's part of human destiny
to move beyond Earth.


196
0:12:29,78 --> 0:12:32,74
It may take a long time,
but I think that


197
0:12:32,74 --> 0:12:33,78
it's part of our future.


198
0:12:33,78 --> 0:12:35,87
There's a great William
Burroughs quote where he says


199
0:12:35,87 --> 0:12:40,845
human beings are not destined
to remain human beings any


200
0:12:40,845 --> 0:12:44,71
more than a tadpole is destined
to remain a tadpole.


201
0:12:44,71 --> 0:12:46,67
We will evolve.


202
0:12:46,67 --> 0:12:48,63
We will move on past Earth.


203
0:12:48,63 --> 0:12:49,88
NIK MOISEEV: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN].


204
0:12:49,88 --> 0:14:49,88
