###9 RYAN DUFFY: Welcome to Bogota, Colombia.
###11 We're here chasing after the most dangerous drug in the
###13 world, burundanga.
###16 Burundanga is the source of scopolamine, which is
###19 basically like the worst roofie you can ever imagine
###21 times a million.
###23 You're at the whim of suggestions like, hey, take me
###26 to your ATM.
###27 Hey, come with me to the hotel room--
###29 while you're completely conscious and articulate.
###31 
###41 Apparently there is a lot of different parts of the plant
###44 that are a bit dangerous, possibly a bit fun, depending
###47 on what you're into.
###48 So we're going to be looking for the tree, talking to
###50 people who've had experience with it, and seeing if we can
###53 find some of the actual drug ourselves.
###55 
###60 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###77 RYAN DUFFY: So the deal with burundanga is that it pretty
###80 much eliminates your free will.
###82 So you're awake and you're articulate.
###85 And to anyone else watching you, it seems like you're
###87 perfectly fine.
###88 But you've completely lost control of your own actions.
###91 So you're at the whim of suggestions.
###93 And that's how people take advantage of you.
###96 I've heard a bunch of different stories really
###99 running the gamut.
###101 Some of them sound like campfire horror stories you're
###103 told when you're growing up.
###104 Stuff like, waking up in a bathtub with an organ cut out
###108 and a sign saying, you have five hours
###109 to get to the hospital.
###111 We've of course also heard that it's used
###113 as a date rape drug.
###114 We heard one particularly chilling story where a guy was
###118 taken back to his apartment, woke up the next morning in an
###122 empty apartment completely confused as to what happened.
###125 Went down and said to his door man, you know, why is my
###128 apartment empty?
###129 What happened?
###131 The doorman said, well, you brought it out with two of
###133 your friends last night.
###133 All your stuff, you loaded it into a van.
###135 And the guy was like, why in the hell would
###137 you let me do that?
###139 And he was like, because you told me to.
###141 So that's kind of the stuff we're dealing with here,
###144 complete elimination of free will while still acting which
###149 is pretty much the scariest shit I can imagine.

###166 
###226 RYAN DUFFY: Columbia's basically fucked.
###228 They had the longest running guerrilla war in
###230 all of Latin America.
###231 They've essentially been at civil war for 60 years.
###233 And really if you think about it, they've never not been at
###235 war since they gained their own independence.
###238 Other fun facts about Colombia, definitely not from
###240 the Board of Tourism, include the fact that one in every
###243 three kidnappings in the world happen right here in Colombia.
###246 And as we all know, it's the cocaine
###248 capital of the universe.
###250 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###251 
###273 RYAN DUFFY: Now the borrachero tree, which by the way roughly
###275 translates to drunken binge tree, is indigenous to the
###279 Northern Andean region.
###280 That includes Colombia, and Ecuador, Venezuela.
###283 But the scopolamine is really only used by the criminal
###285 element here in Colombia.
###287 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###289 
###300 RYAN DUFFY: So despite the insane homicide rates, the
###302 kidnapping, the narco trafficking, the civil unrest,
###305 and everything else going on in here in Columbia, we can't
###308 seem to find a Colombian who's more scared of anything than
###310 falling asleep under the borrachero tree.
###312 [MUSIC PLAYING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###313 
###338 RYAN DUFFY: So far I'm really into Columbia.
###342 I showed up.
###344 Beautiful women ordered me dinner.
###345 And it's fantastic.
###347 And they ordered a bottle of whiskey to the table.
###350 I might not go back.
###352 [MUSIC  PLAYING]
###362 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###364 
###373 
###379 RYAN DUFFY: So it's not something that is popularly
###383 done down here then?
###387 RYAN DUFFY: Really?
###387 Not at all?
###388 
###396 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###400 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###401 
###456 RYAN DUFFY: Do you know people that have been given
###458 burundanga?
###460 Do you have a cousin of a friend of a cousin?
###463 
###491 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###492 
###505 RYAN DUFFY: We're here at the Botanical Gardens on the
###507 outskirts of Bogota.
###508 We're going to go see if we can figure out what this plant
###509 actually looks like.
###511 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###516 RYAN DUFFY: Those right there are the flowers that we've
###519 heard a lot about.
###520 And you can kind of put those in a tea and you'll
###522 hallucinate.
###523 You can also take the root down there, put that in a tea.
###526 And again, you'll hallucinate.
###528 And then there's the cacao, which kind of looks like the
###531 mini coconut of sorts.
###533 That has the seeds inside.
###535 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###537 
###560 RYAN DUFFY: They actually just crack the thing right there.
###563 And then this is where the seeds are.
###568 I mean, that's where everything comes from, right?
###569 SANTIAGO STELLEY: Yeah.
###570 That's what they use to actually make the scopolamine.
###573 RYAN DUFFY: You're in business.
###575 The most dangerous drug in Colombia and
###577 arguably the world.
###579 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###580 
###602 RYAN DUFFY: The coke, at the end of the day, I mean, with
###604 its obvious pitfalls and dangers, is recreational.
###608 SANTIAGO STELLEY: Yeah.
###608 RYAN DUFFY: Whereas there's nothing at all recreational
###612 about what can be made with this.
###614 It's a distinctly criminal element.
###616 
###619 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###620 
###641 RYAN DUFFY: The irony of sorts is that it's beautiful.
###643 It's a very nice plant.
###645 And smells very nicely.
###647 I'm enjoying this right now.
###649 SANTIAGO STELLEY: Seems quite Colombian all-in-all, very
###651 beautiful and very dangerous.
###654 RYAN DUFFY: This is pretty much the symbol of
###656 Columbia isn't it?
###659 If you didn't know what you were looking for, you'd walk
###661 right by and go, that's a pretty flower.
###663 Maybe I'll pick it and give it to my mom.
###664 But that would be a real bad idea.

###802 RYAN DUFFY: So now we're here at the National
###804 University of Columbia.
###805 And we're going to go talk to Dr. Miriam Gutierez who heads
###808 up the toxicology department here and apparently is an
###810 expert on scopolamine.
###812 We're going to try and chat with her a bit about what
###814 actually happens when someone's exposed to the drug.
###816 And try and figure out what this whole zombie
###818 thing really means.

###1048 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1057 RYAN DUFFY: Scopolamine is by no means a modern revelation
###1058 here in Columbia.
###1060 The indigenous people in this area have had a whole bunch of
###1062 uses for the drug.
###1064 For example, when a chieftain died, all his assorted
###1066 females, wives, mistresses, what have you, they
###1069 had to go as well.
###1070 Now that could be a bit of a dicey process.
###1072 But what better way to shore things up than to slip them
###1074 some scopolamine and suggest they walk into a grave.
###1077 When they did, they were buried alive.
###1081 In modern times, there's a whole litany of fucked-up
###1083 people who've been using scopolamine for their benefit.
###1086 For example, in the 1930s and '40s, Josef Mengele had the
###1089 drug imported from Columbia to Germany to use in some of his
###1093 interrogations.
###1094 More recently, the CIA tried to use the drug in the '60s
###1097 during the Cold War as sort of a truth serum.
###1100 The problem with all of this is that in addition to a whole
###1102 lot of truth, there's a good bit of hallucination involved.
###1105 
###1107 We're in a cab right now heading over to the southern
###1109 part of the city.
###1110 We're going to meet with officials at the Bogota City
###1113 Police Department.
###1114 What we're hoping to figure out is a little bit more about
###1117 how the burundanga gangs work.
###1120 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1122 
###1170 [MUSIC PLAYING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1171 
###1188 RYAN DUFFY: So it seems like a lot of the worst scopolamine
###1190 stories that we've heard start and end at
###1192 places just like this.
###1194 And the next thing we're able to get from someone is, I woke
###1197 up on a park bench day and a half later, without my clothes
###1201 on, without any money, whatever it is.
###1202 
###1206 This drug has always been kind of inextricably linked to sex
###1208 in some way or another.
###1210 From its earliest uses, to eliminating a lingering
###1213 mistresses, to fallen chieftains, to its eventual
###1216 use in easing the pain of childbirth, to the stories
###1220 we're hearing on the streets today about prostitutes giving
###1223 it to unsuspecting johns, or about men turning women into
###1226 prostitutes by suggesting they go and earn some cash.
###1229 It always seems to come back to sex in one way or another.
###1232 And it always seems to start at places like this.
###1236 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

###1533 
###1704 RYAN DUFFY: So, so far we've heard a lot of stories about
###1706 burundanga.
###1707 But we'd like to get a little bit closer.
###1709 
###1712 So we've asked some of our Colombian friends to put us in
###1715 touch with someone who has an experience with burundanga.
###1719 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1720 
###1867 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1868 
###1873 
###1875 RYAN DUFFY: No idea.

###1916 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1917 
###1924 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1945 RYAN DUFFY: Oh, my God.
###1949 That better be the scariest drug I ever see in person.
###1955 RYAN DUFFY: Don't let go of that fucking thing.
###1958 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1959 
###2067 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###2069 
###2078 SANTIAGO STELLEY: Are we done with it?
###2080 RYAN DUFFY: I'm fucking over it, dude.
###2082 After all this--
###2084 SANTIAGO STELLEY: Into the sewers?
###2085 RYAN DUFFY: Anywhere but here.
###2086 
###2100 Not bummed to see it go, I'll tell you that much.
###2102 
###2111 Like when I first got here I was super interested in it.
###2115 And it was like this novelty thing.
###2118 I've heard enough stories, man, that I'm just not
###2120 fucking into that.
###2121 It's not funny at all.
###2123 
###2129 FEMALE SPEAKER: Make sure you throw away those gloves before
###2131 you put them around anywhere.
