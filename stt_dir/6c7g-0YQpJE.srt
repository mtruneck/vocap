1
0:0:0,11 --> 0:0:7,0
PROFESSOR: OKAY. SO I GUESS IT'S TIME TO GET
STARTED. ALL


2
0:0:7,0 --> 0:0:11,639
RIGHT SO THE LECTURE EXAM'S GOING TO BE A
WEEK FROM MONDAY. AND


3
0:0:11,639 --> 0:0:16,3
THERE'LL BE 50 QUESTIONS FROM ME AND THEN
THE REST FROM THE OTHER


4
0:0:16,3 --> 0:0:21,71
TWO INSTRUCTORS. AND AS FAR AS RUNNING THIS
REVIEW GOES, AND


5
0:0:21,71 --> 0:0:27,58
THERE'S A LOT OF MATERIAL TO REVIEW IN AN
HOUR, BUT I THOUGHT


6
0:0:27,58 --> 0:0:32,46
QUITE A LOT ABOUT THE EXAM. AND I WANTED TO
GO OVER SOME


7
0:0:32,46 --> 0:0:38,6
GENERAL POINTS THAT I THINK YOU SHOULD BE
SURE TO STUDY. I MEAN


8
0:0:38,6 --> 0:0:42,19
PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME WHAT DEPTH OF STUDY THEY
SHOULD GO INTO.


9
0:0:42,19 --> 0:0:44,35
AND I DEFINITELY WANT TO REITERATE THAT THE
BOOK IS JUST


10
0:0:44,35 --> 0:0:47,829
SUPPLEMENTARY TO THE LECTURE MATERIAL, SO
WHAT'S ON THOSE SLIDES


11
0:0:47,829 --> 0:0:52,44
THAT I MADE PDFS OF AND POSTED IS THE MATERIAL
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE


12
0:0:52,44 --> 0:0:58,579
FOR. AND THE READING WAS JUST TO AUGMENT THAT
TO TRY TO HELP TO


13
0:0:58,579 --> 0:1:1,469
UNDERSTAND THOSE CONCEPTS RATHER THAN IF THERE
ARE NEW CONCEPTS


14
0:1:1,469 --> 0:1:5,88
AND TERMS THAT COME UP IN THE READING, YOU
DON'T NEED TO, TO BE


15
0:1:5,88 --> 0:1:10,93
ABLE TO RECALL THOSE. SO I KNOW THAT THERE
IS SOME MATERIAL I


16
0:1:10,93 --> 0:1:15,64
DIDN'T GET TO IN THE, IN THE ASSIGNED READING.
AND YOU KNOW


17
0:1:15,64 --> 0:1:19,81
THAT'S REALLY JUST TO PUT THINGS IN CONTEXT
RATHER THAN TO, YOU


18
0:1:19,81 --> 0:1:22,1
KNOW, PROVIDE YOU WITH NEW INFORMATION THAT
YOU, YOU'RE


19
0:1:22,1 --> 0:1:32,49
RESPONSIBLE FOR. ALL RIGHT, SO ONE OF THE,
THE FIRST THINGS I


20
0:1:32,49 --> 0:1:36,78
WANT TO MENTION IS AS FAR AS ALL THE DIFFERENT
GROUPS OF


21
0:1:36,78 --> 0:1:42,28
ORGANISMS WE COVERED, THE MAJOR GROUPS THAT
WE TALKED ABOUT YOU


22
0:1:42,28 --> 0:1:44,7
SHOULD BE FAMILIAR WITH. I MEAN WE TALKED
ABOUT THESE THREE


23
0:1:44,7 --> 0:1:49,17
DOMAINS OF LIFE, THE BACTERIA, THE ARCHAEA,
AND THE EUKARYOTES,


24
0:1:49,17 --> 0:1:57,92
EUKARYA, BUT WE DIDN'T FOCUS ON, ON A LOT
OF THESE GROUPS. YOU


25
0:1:57,92 --> 0:1:57,92



26
0:1:57,92 --> 0:2:1,79
KNOW, WITH THE MAIN ONES WE FOCUSED ON WERE
THE FUNGI AND THE


27
0:2:1,79 --> 0:2:8,2
PHOTOSYNTHETIC GROUPS. AND JUST THESE MAIN
GROUPS ARE THE ONES


28
0:2:8,2 --> 0:2:11,62
THAT, THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN ADDITION TO,
OF COURSE, LAND


29
0:2:11,62 --> 0:2:20,54
PLANTS. SO THE FUNGI, THE MAJOR GROUPS OF
ALGAE, AND THE, THE


30
0:2:20,54 --> 0:2:25,12
LAND PLANTS. AND WE WENT INTO MORE DETAIL
THAN, THAN JUST THIS,


31
0:2:25,12 --> 0:2:32,2
OF COURSE. WE WENT INTO, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE
FUNGI, THE MAJOR


32
0:2:32,2 --> 0:2:38,4
PHYLA, THOSE FIVE MAJOR GROUPS, AND, AND THE
ALGAE. WE DIDN'T


33
0:2:38,4 --> 0:2:43,2
TALK IN MUCH DETAIL ABOUT THE MAJOR CLADES
SHOWN HERE AS FAR AS


34
0:2:43,2 --> 0:2:48,8
TAXA WITHIN THOSE. BUT YOU SHOULD BE, YOU
SHOULD BE FAMILIAR


35
0:2:48,8 --> 0:2:51,45
WITH THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE GROUPS THAT
I TALKED ABOUT AND


36
0:2:51,45 --> 0:2:56,849
BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW DISTINGUISH A DINOFLAGELLATE
FROM A DIATOM OR


37
0:2:56,849 --> 0:2:59,8
A BROWN ALGAE FROM A RED ALGAE IN TERMS OF
THE SORTS OF THINGS WE


38
0:2:59,8 --> 0:3:5,54
TALKED ABOUT. NOT BEYOND THAT, BUT, BUT THOSE
ARE, THAT'S THE


39
0:3:5,54 --> 0:3:7,64
LEVEL OF DETAIL I'M LOOKING FOR. I WOULDN'T
BE ASKING YOU TO


40
0:3:7,64 --> 0:3:12,569
RECALL A PARTICULAR GENUS OR YOU KNOW FINE
SCALE TAXON OF SOME


41
0:3:12,569 --> 0:3:17,19
KIND WITHIN THOSE GROUPS, BUT THERE WAS QUITE
A LOT OF TIME SPENT


42
0:3:17,19 --> 0:3:22,209
ON THESE DIFFERENT, DIFFERENT GROUPS. AND
WITHIN THE LAND


43
0:3:22,209 --> 0:3:26,72
PLANTS, OF COURSE, WE TALKED ABOUT BRYOPHYTES,
VASCULAR PLANTS,


44
0:3:26,72 --> 0:3:31,209
SEED PLANTS. AND THEN WITHIN THE SEED PLANTS,
GYMNOSPERMS AND


45
0:3:31,209 --> 0:3:34,769
ANGIOSPERMS. SO, AND WITHIN THE ANGIOSPERMS
YOU KNOW WE SPENT


46
0:3:34,769 --> 0:3:39,73
QUITE A BIT OF TIME COMPARING THE EUDICOT'S
AND THE MONOCOT'S


47
0:3:39,73 --> 0:3:43,17
CHARACTERISTICS THERE. SO IT'S THAT LEVEL
THAT, THAT WE COVERED


48
0:3:43,17 --> 0:3:50,22
IN CLASS THAT I WANT YOU TO, TO STUDY. ARE
THERE QUESTIONS


49
0:3:50,22 --> 0:3:59,489
ABOUT THAT? ALL RIGHT, SO AS FAR AS THE LIFE
CYCLES GO, THERE


50
0:3:59,489 --> 0:4:3,93
ARE A LOT OF LIFE CYCLES THAT WERE PRESENTED
IN THE READING THAT


51
0:4:3,93 --> 0:4:3,93



52
0:4:3,93 --> 0:4:7,43
I DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IN LECTURE, FOR EXAMPLE,
BROWN ALGAE AND


53
0:4:7,43 --> 0:4:11,739
DIFFERENT GROUPS. YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST FOR
YOUR INFORMATION


54
0:4:11,739 --> 0:4:16,469
ONLY, NOT FOR, YOU KNOW, THE EXAM. BUT I DID
SHOW THIS SLIDE.


55
0:4:16,469 --> 0:4:21,259
AND I WOULD LIKE YOU TO REMEMBER THE SORT
OF GENERAL POINTS ABOUT


56
0:4:21,259 --> 0:4:25,659
LIFE CYCLES THAT, YOU KNOW THESE ARE, THESE
ARE SEXUAL LIFE


57
0:4:25,659 --> 0:4:29,249
CYCLES WE TALKED ABOUT THAT INVOLVE MEIOSIS
AND FERTILIZATION.


58
0:4:29,249 --> 0:4:32,99
AND IT'S THE RELATIVE TIMING OF THOSE TWO
PROCESSES THAT


59
0:4:32,99 --> 0:4:37,259
DISTINGUISHES THESE MAJOR LIFE CYCLES, LIKE
WHAT OCCURS IN US AND


60
0:4:37,259 --> 0:4:42,369
OTHER ANIMALS COMPARED TO WHAT HAPPENS IN
PLANTS AND IN FUNGI.


61
0:4:42,369 --> 0:4:47,509
SO BE SURE TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH THIS MATERIAL.
YOU KNOW KEEP


62
0:4:47,509 --> 0:4:53,68
IN MIND IT'S, WHETHER MITOSIS IS LIMITED TO
ONE OF THE TWO PLOIDY


63
0:4:53,68 --> 0:4:59,55
STAGES IS CRITICAL TO INTERPRETING THESE LIFE
CYCLES TOO. SO


64
0:4:59,55 --> 0:5:6,169
UNLIKE US, THE PLANTS HAVE MITOSIS GOING ON
IN THIS HAPLOID PHASE


65
0:5:6,169 --> 0:5:12,749
AND IT ENDS UP, THEY END UP WITH A MULTICELLULAR
BODY, YOU KNOW,


66
0:5:12,749 --> 0:5:15,68
A GAMETOPHYTE, A MULTICELLULAR ORGANISM THAT'S
HAPLOID, SO THAT'S


67
0:5:15,68 --> 0:5:18,889
COMPLETELY ALIEN TO US AND OTHER ANIMALS BUT
IT'S COMMON, OF


68
0:5:18,889 --> 0:5:23,369
COURSE, IN THE, ALL THE, COMMON TO ALL THE
LAND PLANTS AND EVEN


69
0:5:23,369 --> 0:5:26,809
SOME OF THE GREEN ALGAE AND OTHER GROUPS WE
DIDN'T REALLY TALK


70
0:5:26,809 --> 0:5:34,58
ABOUT. SO WERE THERE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE GENERAL
LIFE CYCLE


71
0:5:34,58 --> 0:5:41,289
ISSUES HERE? SO THESE WERE THE FIVE MAJOR
GROUPS OF FUNGI WE


72
0:5:41,289 --> 0:5:44,629
TALKED ABOUT. AND YOU KNOW I'M NOT LOOKING
FOR A HUGE AMOUNT OF


73
0:5:44,629 --> 0:5:48,199
DETAIL HERE, JUST WHAT WAS MENTIONED IN THE
CLASS WHICH WAS


74
0:5:48,199 --> 0:5:51,71
FAIRLY LIMITED. AND THE CHYTRIDS ARE THAT
GROUP THAT STILL HAS


75
0:5:51,71 --> 0:5:55,729
SOME FLAGELLATED STAGES THAT CAN SWIM AROUND
AS FAR AS THE SPORES


76
0:5:55,729 --> 0:6:0,56
AND GAMETES GO, WHICH IS UNUSUAL FOR, FOR
THE FUNGI. AND


77
0:6:0,56 --> 0:6:0,559



78
0:6:0,559 --> 0:6:3,96
THEY'RE THE SISTER TO ALL THE OTHER FUNGI.
THEY'RE AN EARLY


79
0:6:3,96 --> 0:6:10,59
DIVERGING BRANCH. AND LIKE THE ZYGOMYCETES,
THE ZYGOMYCOTA,


80
0:6:10,59 --> 0:6:15,159
THEY HAVE COENOCYTIC HYPHAE WHEN THEY HAVE
HYPHAE. REMEMBER


81
0:6:15,159 --> 0:6:18,71
COENOCYTIC MEANING THAT THE NUCLEI AREN'T
SEPARATED BY ANY


82
0:6:18,71 --> 0:6:24,27
PARTITIONS OR PARTIAL PARTITIONS IN THE, IN
THE BODY OF THE, OF


83
0:6:24,27 --> 0:6:29,949
THE FILAMENTS OR THE MYCELIUM IN GENERAL.
SAME GOES WITH THESE


84
0:6:29,949 --> 0:6:33,889
ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI. THEY'RE SO IMPORTANT
WITH REGARD


85
0:6:33,889 --> 0:6:38,869
TO RELATIONSHIPS WITH PLANT ROOTS. AND IT'S
THIS GROUP OF THE,


86
0:6:38,869 --> 0:6:41,74
THAT MAKES UP THE MOST OF THE FUNGI, THE ASCOMYCETES
AND


87
0:6:41,74 --> 0:6:48,99
BASIDIOMYCETES WHERE WE SEE THE SEPTATE HYPHAE
AND WHERE YOU GET


88
0:6:48,99 --> 0:6:56,559
THIS INTERESTING SITUATION WHERE PLASMOGAMY
AND KARYOGAMY, THE


89
0:6:56,559 --> 0:7:0,719
FUSION OF THE CYTOPLASM AND THE FUSION OF
THE NUCLEI IS DELAY-,


90
0:7:0,719 --> 0:7:4,49
ARE WIDELY SEPARATED IN TIME. AND YOU HAVE
THIS DIKARYOTIC


91
0:7:4,49 --> 0:7:12,99
STAGE. REMEMBER WE HAVE TWO NUCLEI PER SEGMENT
OF EACH HYPHA


92
0:7:12,99 --> 0:7:16,24
SEPARATED BY PARTITION, PARTIAL PARTITIONS.
SO THIS IS


93
0:7:16,24 --> 0:7:18,729
SOMETHING WE JUST SAW IN THE FUNGI, RIGHT,
JUST THESE HIGHER


94
0:7:18,729 --> 0:7:25,619
FUNGI WHERE WE HAVE THIS LIFE CYCLE WHICH
IS OTHERWISE VERY


95
0:7:25,619 --> 0:7:33,479
SIMILAR TO, WELL, IT'S, IT HAS ONLY THE, THE
ONLY DIPLOID STAGE


96
0:7:33,479 --> 0:7:37,55
IS THE ZYGOTE. BUT YOU HAVE THIS LONG PERIOD
WHERE YOU HAVE THE


97
0:7:37,55 --> 0:7:44,289
FUSION OF THE CYTOPLASM PRIOR TO THE FUSION
OF THE NUCLEI WHERE


98
0:7:44,289 --> 0:7:49,589
MUCH OF THE PLANT BODY, FOR EXAMPLE OF THE
BASIDIOMYCETES, IS


99
0:7:49,589 --> 0:7:57,929
DIKARYOTIC LIKE YOU CAN SEE HERE WITH TWO
NUCLEI PER PARTITION.


100
0:7:57,929 --> 0:8:0,99
AND THEN THEY PRODUCE THESE FRUITING BODIES
WHERE YOU ACTUALLY


101
0:8:0,99 --> 0:8:5,279
GET THE FUSION OF THE NEW NUCLEI AND MEIOSIS
OCCURRING RIGHT


102
0:8:5,279 --> 0:8:14,349
AFTER THAT TO PRODUCE SEXUAL SPORES. THOUGH
THAT'S, AND THEN


103
0:8:14,349 --> 0:8:14,349



104
0:8:14,349 --> 0:8:19,819
ALSO REMEMBER THAT IN THE FUNGI THERE ARE
THESE, QUITE A WIDE


105
0:8:19,819 --> 0:8:23,779
DIVERSITY OF DIFFERENT GROUPS WHERE THERE'S
NO, NO SEXUAL


106
0:8:23,779 --> 0:8:27,869
REPRODUCTION THAT'S BEEN DOCUMENTED. AND THESE
HAVE BEEN PLACED


107
0:8:27,869 --> 0:8:32,149
IN THIS GROUP DEUTEROMYCOTA, THE SO-CALLED
IMPERFECT FUNGI THAT


108
0:8:32,149 --> 0:8:37,259
DON'T HAVE ANY KNOWN SEXUAL PHASE. AND THESE
ARE IMPORTANT IN


109
0:8:37,259 --> 0:8:41,159
MEDICINE ET CETERA. BUT THEY'RE, THEY'RE AN
ARTIFICIAL GROUP IN


110
0:8:41,159 --> 0:8:44,43
A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF FUNGI. SO WE DID
TALK ABOUT THIS


111
0:8:44,43 --> 0:8:50,47
GROUP AS WELL. AND I DID MENTION ALSO THE
SLIME MOLDS AND THE


112
0:8:50,47 --> 0:8:53,6
WATER MOLDS WHICH AREN'T TRUE FUNGI BUT HAD
BEEN PREVIOUSLY


113
0:8:53,6 --> 0:9:3,319
TREATED AS FUNGI. SO ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT FUNGI
THAT ANYONE


114
0:9:3,319 --> 0:9:16,5
WANTED TO ASK? ALL RIGHT SO, OH, ONE OTHER
THING ABOUT THE


115
0:9:16,5 --> 0:9:19,48
FUNGI. I'LL GET, MAYBE WE'LL GET TO IT LATER,
BUT THEY HAVE A


116
0:9:19,48 --> 0:9:24,6
LOT OF INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER ORGANISMS,
OF COURSE. AND YOU


117
0:9:24,6 --> 0:9:27,48
KNOW IN ADDITION TO BEING DECOMPOSERS, PARASITES
AND SUCH, THEY


118
0:9:27,48 --> 0:9:31,43
CAN ALSO BE MUTUALISTS. WELL, THEY CAN BE
IN ASSOCIATION,


119
0:9:31,43 --> 0:9:34,85
REGARDLESS OF THEIR MODE OF NUTRITION, THEY
CAN BE IN ASSOCIATION


120
0:9:34,85 --> 0:9:40,81
WITH, WITH DIFFERENT ORGANISMS, LIKE ALGAE,
GREEN ALGAE OR


121
0:9:40,81 --> 0:9:45,74
BLUE-GREEN ALGAE IN THE CASE OF LICHENS, THAT
MUTUALISTIC


122
0:9:45,74 --> 0:9:51,19
ASSOCIATION THAT WE GET, IT'S IMPORTANT IN
PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY


123
0:9:51,19 --> 0:9:58,19
IN ECOSYSTEMS. AND ALSO THE, THE MYCORRHIZAE.
TALKED QUITE A


124
0:9:58,19 --> 0:10:1,56
LOT ABOUT THAT BOTH IN TERMS OF, IN FUNGAL
LECTURES AND LATER ON


125
0:10:1,56 --> 0:10:4,939
IN TALKING ABOUT ROOTS. REMEMBER THE MYCORRHIZAE
IS AN


126
0:10:4,939 --> 0:10:10,49
ASSOCIATION BETWEEN FUNGI AND PLANT ROOTS
THAT IS IMPORTANT TO


127
0:10:10,49 --> 0:10:13,6
THE SUCCESS OF PLANTS. AND IT LOOKS LIKE THAT
ESTABLISHMENT OF


128
0:10:13,6 --> 0:10:17,69
THAT RELATIONSHIP GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO
THE EARLY, EARLIEST


129
0:10:17,69 --> 0:10:17,689



130
0:10:17,689 --> 0:10:22,5
LAND PLANTS. AND SO THAT'S QUITE A, IT'S QUITE
SUGGESTIVE THAT


131
0:10:22,5 --> 0:10:26,139
THE FUNGI WERE PRETTY IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS
OF LAND PLANTS AND


132
0:10:26,139 --> 0:10:33,11
THEY VERY MUCH ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE, THE
PRODUCTIVITY OF PLANTS


133
0:10:33,11 --> 0:10:35,37
TODAY. I MEAN A LOT OF PLANTS CAN SURVIVE
WITHOUT THE


134
0:10:35,37 --> 0:10:39,48
MYCORRHIZAL ASSOCIATION BUT THEY DON'T DO
NEARLY AS WELL AS THEY


135
0:10:39,48 --> 0:10:43,55
DO WITH IT. SO THAT'S ANOTHER THING TO KEEP
IN MIND AS FAR AS


136
0:10:43,55 --> 0:10:47,259
FUNGI, THAT THEY, THEY HAVE REALLY IMPORTANT
ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS.


137
0:10:47,259 --> 0:10:56,72
SO ANY ... ALL RIGHT, SO LET'S, SO THE ALGAE,
WE SPENT QUITE A


138
0:10:56,72 --> 0:11:0,49
BIT OF TIME ON THE ALGAE GROUPS. AND REMEMBER
THE ALGAE ARE NOT


139
0:11:0,49 --> 0:11:3,47
A NATURAL GROUP. THE FUNGI ARE A MONOPHYLETIC
GROUP IF YOU


140
0:11:3,47 --> 0:11:8,54
THROW OUT THE WATER MOLDS, THE YELLOW MYCETES,
AND THE SLIME


141
0:11:8,54 --> 0:11:14,389
MOLDS, AND PRETTY CLOSELY RELATED TO ANIMALS.
BUT HERE THE


142
0:11:14,389 --> 0:11:17,439
CELLULAR SLIME MODELS AND THE PLASMODIAL ONES
ARE CLOSELY


143
0:11:17,439 --> 0:11:21,69
RELATED. BUT REMEMBER THE ALGAE ARE SCATTERED.
THE


144
0:11:21,69 --> 0:11:25,86
PHOTOSYNTHETIC ORGANISMS ARE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT
THE TREE OF


145
0:11:25,86 --> 0:11:31,449
LIFE. THERE AREN'T ANY IN THE ARCHAEA. BUT
WE DO HAVE, YOU KNOW


146
0:11:31,449 --> 0:11:35,189
CYANOBACTERIA REMEMBER WERE FUNDAMENTAL TO
THE EVOLUTION OF


147
0:11:35,189 --> 0:11:38,17
PHOTOSYNTHESIS. THEY'RE THE ONES THAT REALLY
EVOLVED


148
0:11:38,17 --> 0:11:40,639
PHOTOSYNTHESIS. AND IT'S THESE OTHER LINEAGES
THAT JUST


149
0:11:40,639 --> 0:11:50,41
CAPTURED CYANOBACTERIA. AND REMEMBER THERE'S
THIS, PUTATIVELY


150
0:11:50,41 --> 0:11:55,899
AT LEAST, WE CAN ONLY BE SURE OF ONE EVENT
LIKE THAT THAT


151
0:11:55,899 --> 0:12:1,12
HAPPENED WHERE CYANOBACTERIUM WAS CAPTURED
BY AN EARLY EUKARYOTE


152
0:12:1,12 --> 0:12:7,4
THROUGH PHAGOCYTOSIS, YOU KNOW BASICALLY JUST
ENGULFING IT. AND


153
0:12:7,4 --> 0:12:11,35
THEN LATER WE GET THIS SPLIT BETWEEN THE GREEN
ALGAE AND THE RED


154
0:12:11,35 --> 0:12:16,329
ALGAE FOLLOWED BY THE SECONDARY SYMBIOSES
WHERE WE HAVE


155
0:12:16,329 --> 0:12:17,73



156
0:12:17,73 --> 0:12:24,18
UNICELLULAR EUKARYOTES THAT ALREADY POSSESS
A, A CYANOBACTERIUM


157
0:12:24,18 --> 0:12:28,72
OR PLASTID AT THIS POINT IN THEIR EVOLUTION
THAT'S BEEN CAPTURED


158
0:12:28,72 --> 0:12:31,99
AND RECRUITED FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN THIS DIVERSE
SET OF LINEAGES.


159
0:12:31,99 --> 0:12:44,149
SO ARE THERE QUESTIONS ABOUT ENDOSYMBIOSIS?
NO? BE SURE TO


160
0:12:44,149 --> 0:12:47,249
STUDY THIS. I MEAN THIS IS REALLY, I MEAN
PRETTY NOVEL


161
0:12:47,249 --> 0:12:50,139
INFORMATION. I MEAN NOT SO LONG AGO WE FOUND,
YOU KNOW WE'VE


162
0:12:50,139 --> 0:12:54,879
BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT VARIOUS OF THESE
LINEAGES REPRESENT


163
0:12:54,879 --> 0:12:59,74
CAPTURES OF EUKARYOTES. YEAH?


164
0:12:59,74 --> 0:13:3,61
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]


165
0:13:3,61 --> 0:13:8,66
PROFESSOR: SO THE RED ALGAE APPEARED TO, APPEARS
TO HAVE BEEN


166
0:13:8,66 --> 0:13:12,86
THE ONE SECONDARY ENDOSYMBIOSIS THAT GAVE
RISE TO THE, THE


167
0:13:12,86 --> 0:13:18,54
DINOFLAGELLATES WHICH, MANY OF WHICH ARE PHOTOSYNTHETIC.
AND


168
0:13:18,54 --> 0:13:24,829
THEY'RE A BIG COMPONENT OF PHYTOPLANKTON RESPONSIBLE
FOR RED


169
0:13:24,829 --> 0:13:30,43
TIDES. STRAMENOPILES ARE THE OTHER MAJOR GROUP.
THE


170
0:13:30,43 --> 0:13:33,649
APICOMPLEXANS HAVE LOST THEIR ABILITY TO PHOTOSYNTHESIZE.
THEY


171
0:13:33,649 --> 0:13:36,49
JUST HAVE A VESTIGIAL PLASTID, AND I DIDN'T
MENTION THEM MUCH


172
0:13:36,49 --> 0:13:41,449
EXCEPT TO SAY THAT THE MALARIUM, THE MALARIAL
ORGANISM IS IN THIS


173
0:13:41,449 --> 0:13:48,5
CLADE. BUT THE STRAMENOPILES INCLUDE THE BROWN
ALGAE AND THE


174
0:13:48,5 --> 0:13:52,55
DIATOMS AND THE GOLDEN BROWNS. SO, YEAH, THERE
ARE SEVERAL


175
0:13:52,55 --> 0:13:56,769
GROUPS OF PHOTOSYNTHETIC ALGAE WITHIN THAT
GROUP WE CALL


176
0:13:56,769 --> 0:14:0,22
STRAMENOPILES, WHICH ALSO INCLUDE SOME NON-PHOTOSYNTHETIC
GROUPS


177
0:14:0,22 --> 0:14:3,779
THAT PRESUMABLY LOST THEIR ABILITY TO PHOTOSYNTHESIZE,
LIKE THE


178
0:14:3,779 --> 0:14:8,42
OOMYCETES, THOSE WATER MOLDS THAT USED TO
BE THOUGHT TO BE FUNGI.


179
0:14:8,42 --> 0:14:21,329
ALL RIGHT, SO THEN, SO IN ADDITION TO UNDERSTANDING
ENDOSYMBIOSIS


180
0:14:21,329 --> 0:14:24,94
IN TERMS OF THIS, I'D REALLY LIKE YOU TO STUDY,
I PRESENTED


181
0:14:24,94 --> 0:14:24,98



182
0:14:24,98 --> 0:14:30,85
SEVERAL SLIDES ON, ON THE EVIDENCE FOR, FOR
ENDOSYMBIOSIS.


183
0:14:30,85 --> 0:14:34,389
REMEMBER THERE'S A WHOLE SERIES OF, OF DIFFERENT
LINES OF


184
0:14:34,389 --> 0:14:40,1
EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT
I PRESENTED. AND SO


185
0:14:40,1 --> 0:14:47,819
YOU SHOULD FOCUS ON THAT DATA TOO IN TERMS
OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT,


186
0:14:47,819 --> 0:14:51,85
WHAT'S REALLY BEHIND THE HYPOTHESIS IN TERMS
OF, OF EVIDENCE,


187
0:14:51,85 --> 0:15:2,22
OKAY. ALL RIGHT, SO THE ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS
THEN IS THE


188
0:15:2,22 --> 0:15:6,91
MAIN LIFE CYCLE WE FOCUSED ON AFTER WE GOT
TO LAND PLANTS. ALL


189
0:15:6,91 --> 0:15:13,459
THE LAND PLANTS HAVE THIS. AND AGAIN, WE HAVE
BOTH


190
0:15:13,459 --> 0:15:16,809
MULTICELLULAR DIPLOID ORGANISM AND A MULTICELLULAR
HAPLOID


191
0:15:16,809 --> 0:15:21,449
ORGANISM. HAVING A MULTICELLULAR, HAVING BOTH
HAPLOID AND


192
0:15:21,449 --> 0:15:26,12
DIPLOID MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS IS DIAGNOSTIC
OF THIS TYPE OF


193
0:15:26,12 --> 0:15:29,959
LIFE CYCLE, THIS ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS.
REMEMBER AN ANIMAL


194
0:15:29,959 --> 0:15:35,779
LIFE CYCLE, THE ONLY HAPLOID PHASE IS THE
GAMETE. IT'S NOT A


195
0:15:35,779 --> 0:15:40,92
MULTICELLULAR ORGANISM. AND IN THE FUNGI THE
ONLY TRULY DIPLOID


196
0:15:40,92 --> 0:15:44,66
STAGE IS THE ZYGOTE. THAT'S NOT MULTICELLULAR.
WE HAVE MEIOSIS


197
0:15:44,66 --> 0:15:49,639
RIGHT AFTER THAT. SO THIS IS THE, THE MAIN
LIFE CYCLE WE FOCUSED


198
0:15:49,639 --> 0:16:0,619
ON FOR ALL THE LAND PLANTS, ESPECIALLY. AND
I SHOWED YOU THIS


199
0:16:0,619 --> 0:16:3,839
EXAMPLE, IT'S A BIT OF AN ASIDE IN TERMS OF
THE ORGANISM, BUT


200
0:16:3,839 --> 0:16:7,79
JUST TO POINT OUT THAT THERE ARE ORGANISMS
LIKE SEA LETTUCE WHICH


201
0:16:7,79 --> 0:16:12,649
IS A GREEN ALGAE WHERE YOU HAVE VERY SIMILAR
HAPLOID AND DIPLOID


202
0:16:12,649 --> 0:16:16,569
PHASES. AND I MAINLY SHOWED YOU THIS EXAMPLE
JUST TO MAKE IT A


203
0:16:16,569 --> 0:16:19,49
LITTLE EASIER TO UNDERSTAND THIS ALTERNATION
OF GENERATIONS


204
0:16:19,49 --> 0:16:23,759
BECAUSE IN THE LAND PLANTS EITHER ONE PHASE
OR THE OTHER IS SO


205
0:16:23,759 --> 0:16:28,619
HIGHLY REDUCED, THE GAMETOPHYTE OR SPOROPHYTE,
THAT IT'S OFTEN


206
0:16:28,619 --> 0:16:32,829
HARD TO KIND OF PICTURE THOSE AS DISTINCT
ORGANISMS, BUT THEY


207
0:16:32,829 --> 0:16:32,829



208
0:16:32,829 --> 0:16:37,61
ARE. AND SO REMEMBER THE SPOROPHYTE IS THE
SPORE PRODUCING


209
0:16:37,61 --> 0:16:42,29
PLANT. SPORES ARE PRODUCED BY MEIOSIS. WE
GO FROM DIPLOID TO


210
0:16:42,29 --> 0:16:46,74
HAPLOID HERE. BUT UNLIKE IN AN ANIMAL WHERE
AFTER MEIOSIS WE


211
0:16:46,74 --> 0:16:49,959
HAVE GAMETES, HERE WE HAVE SPORES. AND SPORES
UNLIKE GAMETES DO


212
0:16:49,959 --> 0:16:55,959
NOT FUSE WITH ONE ANOTHER. THEY GERMINATE
TO CREATE AND UNDERGO


213
0:16:55,959 --> 0:17:3,6
MITOSES TO PRODUCE A HAPLOID GAMETOPHYTE.
AND SO IN THIS CASE


214
0:17:3,6 --> 0:17:7,579
THEN WE'RE PRODUCING GAMETES BY MITOSIS RATHER
THAN MEIOSIS.


215
0:17:7,579 --> 0:17:11,559
THE MEIOSIS OCCURRED BACK HERE. THAT'S TOTALLY
UNLIKE US IN


216
0:17:11,559 --> 0:17:16,439
THAT SENSE. THOUGH THE GAMETES ARE GENETICALLY
IDENTICAL TO THE


217
0:17:16,439 --> 0:17:21,659
GAMETOPHYTE. AND THEN WE HAVE THE FUSION OF
THE GAMETES AND


218
0:17:21,659 --> 0:17:32,62
THEN THE FORMATION OF THE ZYGOTE AND THE DIPLOID
SPOROPHYTE. SO


219
0:17:32,62 --> 0:17:36,49
THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER TOO THAT THE
LAND PLANTS ARE


220
0:17:36,49 --> 0:17:39,59
INTIMATELY RELATED TO THE GREEN ALGAE. SO
THE GREEN, WHAT WE


221
0:17:39,59 --> 0:17:43,48
CAUSED TO CALL GREEN ALGAE AND WHAT WE STILL
DO TODAY LOOSELY IS


222
0:17:43,48 --> 0:17:47,49
A PARAPHYLETIC GROUP. IT'S NOT MONOPHYLETIC.
SOME OF THE GREEN


223
0:17:47,49 --> 0:17:49,539
ALGAE ARE MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO THE LAND
PLANTS THAN THEY ARE


224
0:17:49,539 --> 0:17:56,11
TO OTHER GREEN ALGAE, OKAY. AND REMEMBER THESE
ARE FRESHWATER


225
0:17:56,11 --> 0:17:59,83
GREEN ALGAE. SO THE LAND PLANTS DIDN'T COME
OUT OF THE OCEAN.


226
0:17:59,83 --> 0:18:4,23
THEY DIDN'T DESCEND FROM SOME MARINE FORM
DIRECTLY. THE CONQUEST


227
0:18:4,23 --> 0:18:9,399
OF LAND WAS VIA WATER INTO THE FRESHWATER
AND THEN TO LAND. SO


228
0:18:9,399 --> 0:18:21,2
IT'S A STEP-WISE PROCESS IT APPEARS. ALL RIGHT?
OKAY, AND SO


229
0:18:21,2 --> 0:18:27,51
THEN WE TALKED ABOUT THESE MAJOR SEVEN GROUPS
OF VASCULAR PLANTS.


230
0:18:27,51 --> 0:18:30,46
AND THREE OF THEM ARE CONSIDERED BRYOPHYTES
EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT


231
0:18:30,46 --> 0:18:34,34
A MONOPHYLETIC GROUP. THEY'RE A GRADE OF LINEAGES,
THE MOSSES,


232
0:18:34,34 --> 0:18:40,74
HORNWORTS, AND LIVERWORTS THAT I MENTIONED
THAT, THAT HAVE A


233
0:18:40,74 --> 0:18:40,89



234
0:18:40,89 --> 0:18:45,47
SUBSET OF THE FEATURES THAT WE, SUBSET OF
ADAPTATIONS TO LAND


235
0:18:45,47 --> 0:18:53,529
THAT WE SEE IN THE VASCULAR PLANTS BUT NOT
ALL OF THEM. SO AND


236
0:18:53,529 --> 0:19:2,47
THE MAIN THINGS THAT WE FOCUSED ON AS FAR
AS -- 
THOUGH THE


237
0:19:2,47 --> 0:19:6,85
FRESHWATER GREEN ALGAE, REMEMBER THEY, EVEN
THOUGH THE SEA


238
0:19:6,85 --> 0:19:10,399
LETTUCE WHICH IS A MARINE ALGA HAS THAT ALTERNATION
OF


239
0:19:10,399 --> 0:19:15,59
GENERATIONS, THE CLOSEST RELATIVES OF LAND
PLANTS DO NOT HAVE AN


240
0:19:15,59 --> 0:19:19,39
ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS. THEIR ONLY DIPLOID
PHASE IS A


241
0:19:19,39 --> 0:19:24,679
ZYGOTE. SO THEY JUST HAVE, ESSENTIALLY THEY
JUST HAVE A


242
0:19:24,679 --> 0:19:28,1
GAMETOPHYTE. THEY JUST HAVE A HAPLOID PHASE.
AND THEN WE SEE


243
0:19:28,1 --> 0:19:32,419
THE INTERJECTION OF A SPOROPHYTE IN THE BRYOPHYTES.
SO THESE DO


244
0:19:32,419 --> 0:19:36,23
HAVE A SPOROPHYTE, BUT IT'S HIGHLY REDUCED.
BUT THE MAIN PLANT


245
0:19:36,23 --> 0:19:41,86
BODY IS HAPLOID. IT'S A GAMETOPHYTE. AND SO
BASED ON THIS


246
0:19:41,86 --> 0:19:46,429
RELATIONSHIP HERE, THE FACT THAT THIS IS PARAPHYLETIC
RELATIVE TO


247
0:19:46,429 --> 0:19:50,909
THE VASCULAR PLANTS, IT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT
THE FEATURES SHARED


248
0:19:50,909 --> 0:19:56,86
BY THESE TAXA WERE ANCESTRAL FOR ALL LAND
PLANTS. OKAY, SO THE


249
0:19:56,86 --> 0:20:0,39
BRYOPHYTES PROVIDE US WITH SOME REAL CLUES
TO WHAT THE ORIGINAL


250
0:20:0,39 --> 0:20:4,84
LAND PLANT WAS LIKE AND THE FEATURES THESE
LINEAGES SHARE WAS


251
0:20:4,84 --> 0:20:9,809
LIKELY ANCESTRAL. SO THE GAMETOPHYTE BEING
DOMINANT AND THE


252
0:20:9,809 --> 0:20:14,179
SPOROPHYTE BEING JUST PARASITIC AND CONNECTED
TO THE GAMETOPHYTE


253
0:20:14,179 --> 0:20:17,24
THROUGHOUT ITS LIFE, THAT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN
ANCESTRAL IN THE


254
0:20:17,24 --> 0:20:24,289
LAND PLANTS. AND THESE ARE FREE-SPORING PLANTS.
THESE ARE NOT


255
0:20:24,289 --> 0:20:29,86
SEED PLANTS. REMEMBER THE SEED PLANTS ARE
ONLY DOWN HERE. AND


256
0:20:29,86 --> 0:20:35,84
HERE WE HAVE THE MOSS LIFE CYCLE. SO AGAIN,
WE HAVE A HAPLOID


257
0:20:35,84 --> 0:20:39,72
PHASE AND A DIPLOID PHASE. BUT THIS DIPLOID
PHASE EVEN THOUGH


258
0:20:39,72 --> 0:20:42,729
THIS MAKES IT LOOK FAIRLY EXTENSIVE, IT'S
JUST THIS PARASITIC


259
0:20:42,729 --> 0:20:43,38



260
0:20:43,38 --> 0:20:49,169
VERY HIGHLY, YOU KNOW, VERY MINOR ORGANISM
THAT'S PARASITIC ON


261
0:20:49,169 --> 0:20:52,669
THE PHOTOSYNTHETIC GAMETOPHYTE BY THIS FOOT
HERE. IT'S JUST


262
0:20:52,669 --> 0:20:56,519
BASICALLY JUST A SPORANGIUM ON A STALK. SO
IT'S PRETTY MINIMAL


263
0:20:56,519 --> 0:21:0,419
AS FAR AS AN ORGANISM GOES, BUT IT IS A MULTICELLULAR
ORGANISM.


264
0:21:0,419 --> 0:21:10,61
AND IT'S GENETICALLY DISTINCT FROM THIS GAMETOPHYTE.
OKAY. SO


265
0:21:10,61 --> 0:21:15,49
THAT'S THE, THE MOSS LIFE CYCLE. ARE THERE
QUESTIONS ABOUT


266
0:21:15,49 --> 0:21:17,38
BRYOPHYTES OR -- YEAH?


267
0:21:17,38 --> 0:21:18,59
STUDENT: SO [INAUDIBLE]


268
0:21:18,59 --> 0:21:23,7
PROFESSOR: YEAH, I'M GOING TO GET TO THAT
IN JUST A MINUTE.


269
0:21:23,7 --> 0:21:26,71
BUT, BUT IT'S A WORTHWHILE POINT TO MAKE HERE
TOO. IT'S GOOD


270
0:21:26,71 --> 0:21:31,649
THAT YOU SAID THAT BECAUSE IN THIS PARTICULAR
EXAMPLE FROM THE


271
0:21:31,649 --> 0:21:39,58
BOOK, YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE, THERE IS IN
THIS CASE WE HAVE SEP-,


272
0:21:39,58 --> 0:21:43,2
WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF GAMETOPHYTES,
A FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE


273
0:21:43,2 --> 0:21:49,549
AND A MALE GAMETOPHYTE. SOME MOSSES DO SHOW
THAT SORT OF


274
0:21:49,549 --> 0:21:52,6
DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THEIR GAMETOPHYTES
WHERE THEY HAVE MALE


275
0:21:52,6 --> 0:21:56,809
AND FEMALE GAMETOPHYTES. BUT THE SPORE SIZES
REMAIN THE SAME,


276
0:21:56,809 --> 0:22:0,269
AND THEY DON'T HAVE DISTINCTIVE SPORANGIA
THAT PRODUCE A


277
0:22:0,269 --> 0:22:3,44
MEGASPORE THAT GERMINATES TO BE THE FEMALE
GAMETOPHYTE AND A


278
0:22:3,44 --> 0:22:7,74
SMALLER MICROSPORE THAT GERMINATES TO BE THE
MALE GAMETOPHYTE.


279
0:22:7,74 --> 0:22:12,21
SO THAT, THAT CONCEPT OF HETEROSPORY IS GENERALLY
DISCUSSED ONLY


280
0:22:12,21 --> 0:22:17,36
IN, IN THE CONTEXT OF, OF VASCULAR PLANTS
NOT THE BRYOPHYTES.


281
0:22:17,36 --> 0:22:19,82
BUT NONETHELESS ONE OF THE MAIN DISTINCTIONS
BETWEEN


282
0:22:19,82 --> 0:22:23,38
HETEROSPOROUS AND HOMOSPOROUS VASCULAR PLANTS
IS THAT IN


283
0:22:23,38 --> 0:22:26,75
HETEROSPOROUS VASCULAR PLANTS YOU HAVE UNISEXUAL
GAMETOPHYTES.


284
0:22:26,75 --> 0:22:31,49
YOU HAVE MALE GAMETOPHYTES THAT PRODUCE SPERM
AND YOU HAVE FEMALE


285
0:22:31,49 --> 0:22:31,49



286
0:22:31,49 --> 0:22:35,37
GAMETOPHYTES THAT PRODUCE EGGS. YOU DON'T
HAVE BISEXUAL


287
0:22:35,37 --> 0:22:39,59
GAMETOPHYTES THAT PRODUCE BOTH. OKAY, SO THAT'S,
AND THAT'S


288
0:22:39,59 --> 0:22:42,279
GOING ON HERE IN THIS PARTICULAR MOSS. BUT
SOME MOSSES DO IT


289
0:22:42,279 --> 0:22:47,25
THIS WAY, AND SOME MOSSES HAVE BISEXUAL GAMETOPHYTES.
YEAH?


290
0:22:47,25 --> 0:22:50,169
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]


291
0:22:50,169 --> 0:22:55,51
PROFESSOR: HERE THEY CAN BE TO SOME EXTENT,
YEAH. SO THAT CAN


292
0:22:55,51 --> 0:22:59,12
BE TRUE IN BRYOPHYTES. IT'S A RELATIVELY MINOR
AMOUNT OF


293
0:22:59,12 --> 0:23:2,149
PHOTOSYNTHATE THEY PRODUCE COMPARED TO WHAT,
WHAT THE


294
0:23:2,149 --> 0:23:5,309
GAMETOPHYTES PRODUCE. BUT, YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.
IN FACT, SOME OF


295
0:23:5,309 --> 0:23:8,84
THEM HAVE STOMATA. SO THERE ARE SOME BRYOPHYTES,
NOT, NOT


296
0:23:8,84 --> 0:23:13,48
LIVERWORTS, BUT THERE ARE SOME SPOROPHYTES
THAT PRODUCE, MOSSES


297
0:23:13,48 --> 0:23:18,0
AND HORNWORTS THAT PRODUCE STOMATA. SO THAT'S,
THAT'S AN


298
0:23:18,0 --> 0:23:25,34
INTERESTING SITUATION TOO. YEAH?


299
0:23:25,34 --> 0:23:29,1
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]


300
0:23:29,1 --> 0:23:32,679
PROFESSOR: SORRY?


301
0:23:32,679 --> 0:23:36,35
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]


302
0:23:36,35 --> 0:23:44,6
PROFESSOR: OH, NO, NOT THE DATES. BUT IT SHOULD,
ONE THING


303
0:23:44,6 --> 0:23:47,1
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THOUGH IS THAT
IT'S CLEAR THAT THE


304
0:23:47,1 --> 0:23:52,46
BRYOPHYTES, BASICALLY THE BRYOPHYTE LINEAGE
FOLLOWS THIS, IF YOU


305
0:23:52,46 --> 0:24:0,1
FOLLOW THE MAIN BACKBONE OF THIS LAND PLANT
PHYLOGENY, THE


306
0:24:0,1 --> 0:24:4,45
BRYOPHYTES ARE EARLY BRANCHING HERE. SO YOU
KNOW THE ORGANISMS


307
0:24:4,45 --> 0:24:6,789
THAT EXISTED THROUGH THIS PART OF THE TREE
WOULD HAVE SHARED THE


308
0:24:6,789 --> 0:24:11,58
FEATURES THAT ALL OF THESE THREE GROUPS HAVE.
THOUGH THE


309
0:24:11,58 --> 0:24:17,419
BRYOPHYTE BIOLOGY WAS IN PLACE HERE PRIOR
TO THE, THE VASCULAR


310
0:24:17,419 --> 0:24:20,23
PLANT BIOLOGY, THE DISTINGUISHING FEATURES
OF THE VASCULAR


311
0:24:20,23 --> 0:24:20,71



312
0:24:20,71 --> 0:24:24,61
PLANTS. THOUGH THE SPOROPHYTE DOMINANCE DOESN'T
COME INTO PLAY


313
0:24:24,61 --> 0:24:31,45
UNTIL AFTER, SOMEWHERE ALONG THIS BRANCH.
OKAY. REMEMBER I


314
0:24:31,45 --> 0:24:34,22
DID POINT OUT THAT THERE WAS, THERE ARE SOME
FOSSIL VASCULAR


315
0:24:34,22 --> 0:24:37,809
PLANTS THAT ARE, WOULD BE SOMEWHERE ALONG
THIS BRANCH THAT HAVE


316
0:24:37,809 --> 0:24:40,419
ISOMORPHIC ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS WHERE
THE GAMETOPHYTE AND


317
0:24:40,419 --> 0:24:44,38
AND THE SPOROPHYTE LOOK THE SAME. SO THERE'S
A TRANSITIONAL


318
0:24:44,38 --> 0:24:48,159
FOSSIL BETWEEN GAMETOPHYTE DOMINANCE AND SPOROPHYTE
DOMINANCE,


319
0:24:48,159 --> 0:24:52,49
BUT NONE OF THOSE PLANTS ARE STILL EXTANT.
THEY'RE WAY BACK IN


320
0:24:52,49 --> 0:25:6,559
THE PALEOZOIC. ALL RIGHT, AND THIS IS JUST,
YOU SAW THIS


321
0:25:6,559 --> 0:25:10,36
EARLIER. THIS IS JUST REITERATING THE POINT
THAT I ALREADY MADE


322
0:25:10,36 --> 0:25:15,85
THAT YOU KNOW THE LAND PLANTS HAVE BOTH MULTICELLULAR
HAPLOID AND


323
0:25:15,85 --> 0:25:20,46
DIPLOID GENERATIONS, WHEREAS THAT'S NOT TRUE
FOR FUNGI AND


324
0:25:20,46 --> 0:25:28,74
ANIMALS. THEY HAVE ONE OR THE OTHER. OKAY,
THEN WE GOT INTO


325
0:25:28,74 --> 0:25:36,49
THE, INTO THE VASCULAR PLANTS. THE FERN LIFE
CYCLE IS THE FIRST


326
0:25:36,49 --> 0:25:42,87
ONE WE TALKED ABOUT. AND IN THINKING ABOUT
ALL OF THIS, YOU


327
0:25:42,87 --> 0:25:48,1
SHOULD ALSO BE, AS YOU GO THROUGH THE NOTES,
THINK ABOUT THE


328
0:25:48,1 --> 0:25:53,679
FEATURES THAT, THAT WE SEE HAP-, COMING INTO
PLACE WITHIN THE,


329
0:25:53,679 --> 0:26:1,1
THE LAND PLANT PHYLOGENY THAT HAVE POTENTIAL
VALUE FOR LIFE ON


330
0:26:1,1 --> 0:26:5,889
LAND. THOUGH, YOU KNOW, THINGS LIKE A CUTICLE,
AND I'LL GO


331
0:26:5,889 --> 0:26:8,76
THROUGH SOME OF THOSE IN A MINUTE, BUT JUST
I WANT TO MAKE THAT


332
0:26:8,76 --> 0:26:12,34
POINT NOW SINCE WE'RE GETTING INTO LAND PLANTS
MORE THAT THIS


333
0:26:12,34 --> 0:26:15,48
THEME OF LIFE ON LAND, YOU KNOW, KEEP THAT
IN MIND AS, AS YOU'RE


334
0:26:15,48 --> 0:26:21,25
STUDYING. AND THERE'S A, THERE'S A DIAGRAM
I'LL SHOW YOU IN A


335
0:26:21,25 --> 0:26:25,5
MINUTE THAT'S HELPFUL WITH REGARD TO THAT.
BUT THE FERN LIFE


336
0:26:25,5 --> 0:26:28,36
CYCLE THEN IS ONE WHERE, IS THE FIRST ONE
WE LOOKED AT WHERE THE


337
0:26:28,36 --> 0:26:28,58



338
0:26:28,58 --> 0:26:33,409
SPOROPHYTE IS DOMINANT. AND I SPENT A LITTLE
TIME TALKING ABOUT


339
0:26:33,409 --> 0:26:39,72
THE, THE FERN MORPHOLOGY. SO REMEMBER IN FERNS
THE AERIAL PART,


340
0:26:39,72 --> 0:26:42,99
THE PART THAT'S ACTUALLY ABOVE GROUND IS,
IS USUALLY JUST THE


341
0:26:42,99 --> 0:26:47,639
LEAVES. AND THE MAIN PART OF THE PLANT UNDERGROUND
IS THE STEM


342
0:26:47,639 --> 0:26:51,44
AND THE ROOTS. SO THE STEMS ARE TYPICALLY
HORIZONTAL EXCEPT IN


343
0:26:51,44 --> 0:26:55,98
THE TREE FERNS WHICH ARE A PRETTY MINOR GROUP
OVERALL IN TERMS OF


344
0:26:55,98 --> 0:27:1,409
DIVERSITY. AND ALSO WE TALKED ABOUT HOW THE
SPORANGIA ARE BORNE


345
0:27:1,409 --> 0:27:6,309
ON THESE UNDERSIDES OF THE LEAVES IN THESE
STRUCTURES CALLED SORI


346
0:27:6,309 --> 0:27:10,47
THAT ARE CLUSTERS OF SPORANGIA. AND THEN THE
SPORANGIA THEN


347
0:27:10,47 --> 0:27:15,97
PRODUCE SPORES. SO I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO
KEEP IN MIND THE,


348
0:27:15,97 --> 0:27:19,659
THE SCALE HERE, YOU KNOW, IN TERMS OF WHAT
THE, YOU KNOW, SPORES


349
0:27:19,659 --> 0:27:24,19
ARE INSIDE SPORANGIA. SPORANGIA ARE INSIDE
SORI. YOU KNOW


350
0:27:24,19 --> 0:27:27,269
SORI ARE ON THE LEAVES. I MEAN YOU SHOULD
HAVE SOME SENSE OF


351
0:27:27,269 --> 0:27:29,97
THE OVERALL SCALE OR THE SIZE OF THESE THINGS
RELATIVE TO ONE


352
0:27:29,97 --> 0:27:35,2
ANOTHER, AND, YOU KNOW, REALIZE THAT, YOU
KNOW, THAT'S SORT OF A


353
0:27:35,2 --> 0:27:39,82
BASIC POINT. BUT, I KNOW IT'S EASY TO GET
CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT'S


354
0:27:39,82 --> 0:27:43,49
A SPORE, WHAT'S A SPORANGIUM. BUT YOU KNOW
THE SPORANGIUM IS A


355
0:27:43,49 --> 0:27:48,909
MULTICELLULAR SAC THAT BEARS SPORES, AS A
GAMETANGIUM IS A


356
0:27:48,909 --> 0:27:53,659
MULTICELLULAR SAC THAT BEARS GAMETES ON THE
GAMETOPHYTE. AND


357
0:27:53,659 --> 0:27:57,759
THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF GAMETANGIA. THE ANTHERIDIUM
THAT


358
0:27:57,759 --> 0:28:2,799
PRODUCES SPERM AND THE ARCHEGONIUM THAT PRODUCES
EGGS. I MEAN


359
0:28:2,799 --> 0:28:6,86
THAT'S SOME BASIC TERMINOLOGY THAT, THAT APPLIES
ACROSS, ACROSS


360
0:28:6,86 --> 0:28:9,98
THESE GROUPS THAT, THAT YOU SHOULD BE AWARE
OF, YOU KNOW AND


361
0:28:9,98 --> 0:28:16,389
SHOULD BE FAMILIAR WITH. AND SOMETHING LIKE
SORUS YOU KNOW OR


362
0:28:16,389 --> 0:28:19,62
SORI, THAT'S, THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH
FEATURE THAT YOU KNOW I


363
0:28:19,62 --> 0:28:20,149



364
0:28:20,149 --> 0:28:24,669
WOULD EXPECT YOU TO REMEMBER THAT. BUT YOU
KNOW THERE'S A LOT


365
0:28:24,669 --> 0:28:28,149
OF THIS TERMINOLOGY COMES UP AGAIN AND AGAIN.
THERE'S A LITTLE


366
0:28:28,149 --> 0:28:31,269
BIT OF SPECIFIC TERMINOLOGY IN THE FERNS THAT,
THAT I THINK, YOU


367
0:28:31,269 --> 0:28:35,71
KNOW THAT I FOCUSED ON THAT'S WORTH REMEMBERING.
QUESTIONS


368
0:28:35,71 --> 0:28:38,69
ABOUT FERNS? YEAH?


369
0:28:38,69 --> 0:28:44,29
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]. WHAT IS THE FUNCTION
OF RHIZOIDS?


370
0:28:44,29 --> 0:28:52,34
PROFESSOR: OH, RHIZOIDS. WELL, THEY CAN SERVE
TO ANCHOR A


371
0:28:52,34 --> 0:28:58,94
PLANT TO THE, TO THEIR SUBSTRATE. THEY'RE
NOT SO FUNCTIONAL IN


372
0:28:58,94 --> 0:29:4,389
ABSORPTION AS A ROOT. ROOTS COME INTO PLAY,
THAT'S ONE OF THE


373
0:29:4,389 --> 0:29:8,35
THINGS I MENTIONED IN TERMS OF ADAPTATIONS
TO LAND IN THE, IN THE


374
0:29:8,35 --> 0:29:11,22
VASCULAR PLANTS WE HAVE THE EVALUATION OF
ROOTS. WE DON'T SEE


375
0:29:11,22 --> 0:29:16,13
THOSE IN THE BRYOPHYTES. WE JUST HAVE RHIZOIDS.
AND IN THE


376
0:29:16,13 --> 0:29:21,769
FERN GAMETOPHYTE WE HAVE RHIZOIDS TOO, BUT
NOT IN THE SPOROPHYTE.


377
0:29:21,769 --> 0:29:24,529
BUT, YEAH, THEY'RE, THEY MAINLY HAVE AN ANCHORAGE
FUNCTION, NOT


378
0:29:24,529 --> 0:29:30,509
SO MUCH AN ABSORPTION FUNCTION. THOUGH GAMETOPHYTES
CAN ABSORB


379
0:29:30,509 --> 0:29:34,8
MOISTURE RIGHT THROUGH THEIR, THROUGH THE
MAIN BODY OF THE


380
0:29:34,8 --> 0:29:44,36
PHALLUS AS IN A BRYOPHYTE. SO HERE'S HETEROSPORY
AGAIN. AND


381
0:29:44,36 --> 0:29:47,86
THIS OCCURS REMEMBER IN THE LYCOPHYTES AND
SOME OF THEM, THAT'S


382
0:29:47,86 --> 0:29:52,169
WHAT THIS IS, IS A LYCOPHYTE CONE FROM THE
SELAGINELLA WHERE YOU


383
0:29:52,169 --> 0:29:56,919
CAN SEE MEGASPORES ON THE LEFT AND MICROSPORES
ON THE RIGHT IN


384
0:29:56,919 --> 0:30:3,649
THESE, IN A MICROSPORANGIUM AND A MEGASPORANGIUM.
SO AGAIN,


385
0:30:3,649 --> 0:30:7,2
THESE ARE SPORES PRODUCED BY MEIOSIS FROM
THE SPOROPHYTE, BUT IT


386
0:30:7,2 --> 0:30:9,99
JUST SO HAPPENS THE SPOROPHYTE PRODUCES TWO
DIFFERENT TYPES OF


387
0:30:9,99 --> 0:30:15,75
SPORES IN DIFFERENT SPORANGIA. AND THESE GERMINATE
TO BE FEMALE


388
0:30:15,75 --> 0:30:19,75
GAMETOPHYTES AND THESE GERMINATE TO BE MALE
GAMETOPHYTES. SO WE


389
0:30:19,75 --> 0:30:19,75



390
0:30:19,75 --> 0:30:24,73
HAVE A SEPARATION OF FUNCTION HERE. LESS CHANCE
FOR SELFING.


391
0:30:24,73 --> 0:30:31,279
AND IN ALL THESE ORGANISMS THAT HAVE THIS
UNISEXUAL GAMETOPHYTE,


392
0:30:31,279 --> 0:30:35,57
YOU HAVE GERMINATION OR YOU HAVE THE MULTICELLULAR
GAMETOPHYTE


393
0:30:35,57 --> 0:30:40,769
LIVING WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE SPORE WALL.
SO THEY, THEY CAN


394
0:30:40,769 --> 0:30:44,22
EMERGE TO SOME EXTENT LIKE THE POLLEN TUBE
YOU KNOW THAT GROWS


395
0:30:44,22 --> 0:30:48,399
OUT OF IN THE CASE OF SEED PLANTS, THE POLLEN
YOU KNOW EMERGES AS


396
0:30:48,399 --> 0:30:53,58
A TUBE. BUT FOR THE MOST PART THERE'S, THERE'S
CONTAINMENT


397
0:30:53,58 --> 0:30:59,0
WITHIN THIS SPORE WALL FOR A LONG PERIOD OF
TIME. SO THE, THE


398
0:30:59,0 --> 0:31:3,809
HETEROSPOROUS ORGANISMS WHICH INCLUDED SOME
LYCOPHYTES, A VERY


399
0:31:3,809 --> 0:31:7,86
SMALL NUMBER OF FERNS WHICH WE DIDN'T FOCUS
ON AT ALL OR IT'S NOT


400
0:31:7,86 --> 0:31:11,21
REALLY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER BUT THE WATER
FERNS, AND ALL OF THE


401
0:31:11,21 --> 0:31:15,879
SEED PLANTS. ALL THE SEED PLANTS ARE HETEROSPOROUS.
IN THOSE


402
0:31:15,879 --> 0:31:21,909
WE GET THIS DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THE SPORE TO
SOME EXTENT. ARE


403
0:31:21,909 --> 0:31:25,33
THERE QUESTIONS ABOUT HETEROSPORY THEN? YEAH?


404
0:31:25,33 --> 0:31:33,58
STUDENT: ARE ALL THE HETEROSPOROUS [INAUDIBLE]


405
0:31:33,58 --> 0:31:39,899
PROFESSOR: NO, THEY DON'T. THEY DON'T HAVE
ALL STROBILI. BUT


406
0:31:39,899 --> 0:31:43,82
THE ONES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT DO. BECAUSE
WE JUST, REALLY THE


407
0:31:43,82 --> 0:31:48,759
ONLY HETEROSPOROUS PLANTS WE REALLY FOCUSED
ON MUCH WERE, WERE


408
0:31:48,759 --> 0:31:55,25
GYMNO- WERE IN THE SEED PLANTS. I DID MENTION
SELAGINELLA IN


409
0:31:55,25 --> 0:31:59,23
THE LYCOPHYTES, THESE MOSS-LIKE PLANTS WHICH
THIS IS. AND THIS


410
0:31:59,23 --> 0:32:2,49
DOES HAVE A STROBILUS. BUT THERE'S, THERE'S
SOMETHING CALLED


411
0:32:2,49 --> 0:32:6,47
QUILLWORTS THAT WE DIDN'T GET INTO, THESE
ISOETES THAT DON'T HAVE


412
0:32:6,47 --> 0:32:10,289
STROBILI. AND THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE LARGEST
OF ALL MEGASPORES.


413
0:32:10,289 --> 0:32:17,429
YOU CAN SEE THEM WITH YOUR NAKED EYE PRETTY
WELL. BUT, BUT YEAH


414
0:32:17,429 --> 0:32:20,99
THAT, OFTENTIMES YOU DO HAVE, GENERALLY YOU
HAVE STROBILI OR


415
0:32:20,99 --> 0:32:20,99



416
0:32:20,99 --> 0:32:37,48
CONES. SO SEED PLANTS THEN,


417
0:32:37,48 --> 0:32:39,44
SO IN THE CASE OF, WE WENT INTO THE


418
0:32:39,44 --> 0:32:44,59
PINE LIFE CYCLE, AN EXAMPLE OF A GYMNOSPERM
LIFE CYCLE. SO


419
0:32:44,59 --> 0:32:50,0
REMEMBER WE'RE SEEING THIS TREND IN THE LAND
PLANTS FROM, THAT'S


420
0:32:50,0 --> 0:32:52,1
BASICALLY, OR AT LEAST IN THE WAY THAT WE'VE
LOOKED AT THESE


421
0:32:52,1 --> 0:32:57,179
GROUPS, WE'RE SEEING PROGRESSIVE REDUCTION
OF THE GAMETOPHYTE


422
0:32:57,179 --> 0:33:4,429
GENERATION AND INCREASING DOMINANCE OF THE
SPOROPHYTE GENERATION.


423
0:33:4,429 --> 0:33:11,2
AND IN THE CASE OF THE SEED PLANTS THEN, THE
GAMETOPHYTES


424
0:33:11,2 --> 0:33:13,98
REPRESENT THE POLLEN IN THE CASE OF THE MALE
GAMETOPHYTE, SO THE


425
0:33:13,98 --> 0:33:18,75
POLLEN IS THE MALE GAMETOPHYTE. AND IT'S DISPERSED
IN AN


426
0:33:18,75 --> 0:33:24,23
IMMATURE STAGE, BUT IT'S ALREADY UNDERGONE
AT LEAST ONE MITOTIC


427
0:33:24,23 --> 0:33:28,36
DIVISION BEFORE IT'S DISPERSED FROM THE MICROSPORANGIA
OR THE


428
0:33:28,36 --> 0:33:33,21
POLLEN SACS. AND, AND THEN THE MEGAGAMETOPHYTE
REMEMBER IS


429
0:33:33,21 --> 0:33:39,179
CONTAINED WITHIN THE OVULE. SO THE OVULE,
THE IMMATURE SEED IS


430
0:33:39,179 --> 0:33:42,269
THE HOME OF THE FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE AND IT
NEVER LEAVES THAT, THAT


431
0:33:42,269 --> 0:33:48,769
SITE. SO IT'S NEVER SHED FROM THE MEGASPORANGIUM
WHICH IS ALSO


432
0:33:48,769 --> 0:33:51,85
CONTAINED WITHIN THE OVULE. THE OVULE IN ITS
EARLIEST STAGE


433
0:33:51,85 --> 0:33:55,33
REMEMBER IS JUST A MEGASPORANGIUM WITH INTEGUMENT
AROUND IT WHICH


434
0:33:55,33 --> 0:34:0,759
IS A NOVEL STRUCTURE THAT BECOMES THE SEED
COAT. IT DOESN'T


435
0:34:0,759 --> 0:34:4,46
HAVE A HOMOLOGUE IN THE, WE'RE CLEAR ABOUT
AT LEAST IN THESE


436
0:34:4,46 --> 0:34:17,33
OTHER, IN THE NON-SEED PLANTS. AND WENT THROUGH
THE STAGES OF


437
0:34:17,33 --> 0:34:23,58
POLLINATION AND FERTILIZATION AND, IN THE
CONIFER, IN THE PINE.


438
0:34:23,58 --> 0:34:28,2
SO REMEMBER POLLINATION IN THE GYMNOSPERMS
MEANS THE POLLEN IS


439
0:34:28,2 --> 0:34:33,27
ACTUALLY LANDING AT THE MICROPYLAR OPENING
INTO THE OVULE. THIS


440
0:34:33,27 --> 0:34:36,28
IS DIFFERENT REMEMBER THAN IN FLOWERING PLANTS.
WE'LL GET TO


441
0:34:36,28 --> 0:34:40,629
BACK IN A MINUTE. BUT HERE POLLINATION MEANS
THE POLLEN HAS TO


442
0:34:40,629 --> 0:34:40,63



443
0:34:40,63 --> 0:34:43,9
ARRIVE AT THE OVULE ITSELF, SO RIGHT AT THE
DOORSTEP OF THE


444
0:34:43,9 --> 0:34:48,29
FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE, THOUGH IT HAS TO GET TO
THIS POINT INTO THE


445
0:34:48,29 --> 0:34:52,61
POLLEN CHAMBER AND THEN THE POLLEN TUBE GERMINATES,
WE GET MORE


446
0:34:52,61 --> 0:34:58,35
MITOTIC DIVISION, AND GROWS DOWN TO THE EGG
INSIDE THE


447
0:34:58,35 --> 0:35:6,38
ARCHEGONIUM. OKAY. AND THEN WE'VE ULTIMATELY
HAVE


448
0:35:6,38 --> 0:35:10,96
GERMINATION, OR WE HAVE, SORRY, WE HAVE THE
FERTILIZATION OF THE


449
0:35:10,96 --> 0:35:16,11
EGG. AND REMEMBER THERE'S JUST ONE FERTILIZATION
EVENT IN THE


450
0:35:16,11 --> 0:35:20,35
CONIFERS IN THE SEED, IN THE PINES. AND THEN
WE ULTIMATELY GET


451
0:35:20,35 --> 0:35:24,7
THE EMBRYO DEVELOPING INSIDE HERE. SO REMEMBER
THERE ARE


452
0:35:24,7 --> 0:35:28,26
EMBRYOS IN ALL OF THE LAND PLANTS. IT'S IN
THE SEED PLANTS


453
0:35:28,26 --> 0:35:34,28
WHERE THE EMBRYO HAS THIS LONG DORMANT PHASE
OR LONG INACTIVE


454
0:35:34,28 --> 0:35:41,82
PHASE WHERE THE SEED BECOMES DESICCATED. AND
REMEMBER I


455
0:35:41,82 --> 0:35:44,85
MENTIONED IN THE LAST LECTURE THAT ABA, ABSCISIC
ACID, IS


456
0:35:44,85 --> 0:35:48,91
INVOLVED IN PREPARING THE SEED FOR THAT. BUT
IN ANY CASE WE


457
0:35:48,91 --> 0:35:52,62
HAVE THREE GENERATIONS OF TISSUE HERE. WE'VE
GOT THE ORIGINAL


458
0:35:52,62 --> 0:35:56,63
PARENT SPOROPHYTE, THE DIPLOID TISSUE ON THE
OUTSIDE. WE HAVE


459
0:35:56,63 --> 0:36:0,77
THE HAPLOID FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE TISSUE. THAT'S
THE NUTRITIVE


460
0:36:0,77 --> 0:36:4,72
TISSUE FOR THE EMBRYO WHICH IS THE NEXT GENERATION
OF DIPLOID


461
0:36:4,72 --> 0:36:10,13
SPOROPHYTE. THOUGH DIPLOID, HAPLOID, DIPLOID,
THREE GENERATIONS


462
0:36:10,13 --> 0:36:17,9
OF TISSUE THERE IN THE PINE. ARE THERE QUESTIONS
ABOUT THIS?


463
0:36:17,9 --> 0:36:22,84
THIS DOESN'T REQUIRE FREESTANDING WATER. WE
HAVE VERY, MUCH


464
0:36:22,84 --> 0:36:27,19
MORE SHELTERING OF THE GAMETOPHYTES FROM THE
ENVIRONMENT. AND


465
0:36:27,19 --> 0:36:30,92
WE HAVE A LOT OF PROTECTION PROVIDED NOW TO
THE FEMALE


466
0:36:30,92 --> 0:36:34,7
GAMETOPHYTE AND TO THE SUBSEQUENT SPOROPHYTE
GENERATION AS WELL


467
0:36:34,7 --> 0:36:39,1
AS DISPERSAL PROTECTION DURING DISPERSAL FROM
THE PARENT


468
0:36:39,1 --> 0:36:39,1



469
0:36:39,1 --> 0:36:45,84
SPOROPHYTE. OKAY, ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT?
SO NOW TO THE


470
0:36:45,84 --> 0:36:50,98
FLOWERING PLANTS. SO REMEMBER THE FLOWERING
PLANTS, ON THE


471
0:36:50,98 --> 0:36:59,58
FLOWER IS BASICALLY A STROBILUS OR A CONE,
A CONE. AND ONE OF


472
0:36:59,58 --> 0:37:2,17
THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURES OF THE FLOWERING
PLANTS


473
0:37:2,17 --> 0:37:8,9
DIFFERENTIATING THEM FROM THE GYMNOSPERMS
IS THE CARPEL OR THE


474
0:37:8,9 --> 0:37:12,65
PRESENCE OF A PISTOL COMPRISED OF ONE OR MORE
CARPELS WHICH ARE


475
0:37:12,65 --> 0:37:17,12
BASICALLY LEAVES THAT HAVE FUSED ALONG THEIR
MARGIN TO PRODUCE A


476
0:37:17,12 --> 0:37:21,96
CHAMBER IN WHICH THE OVULES ARE CONTAINED.
SO THE OVULES ARE


477
0:37:21,96 --> 0:37:24,27
PROTECTED FROM THE ENVIRONMENT. POLLINATION
INVOLVES


478
0:37:24,27 --> 0:37:29,2
GERMINATION OF THE POLLEN AWAY FROM THE OVULES
ON THE STIGMA.


479
0:37:29,2 --> 0:37:33,19
AND THEN WE HAVE A LOT MORE FEMALE SELECTIVITY
HERE IN TERMS OF


480
0:37:33,19 --> 0:37:37,4
OR AT LEAST PARENTAL SELECTIVITY ON THE PART
OF THE PARENT OF


481
0:37:37,4 --> 0:37:43,6
THESE FEMALE GAMETOPHYTES WITH REGARD TO POLLEN,
PARENT OF THOSE


482
0:37:43,6 --> 0:37:48,78
GAMETOPHYTE, MALE PARENT, OR MALE MATE FOR
THESE FEMALE


483
0:37:48,78 --> 0:37:56,17
GAMETOPHYTES, AND ALSO COMPETITION BETWEEN
THE MALES HERE GROWING


484
0:37:56,17 --> 0:38:3,39
DOWN THROUGH THE STYLE. OKAY, SO THAT, THAT'S
ONE OF THE MAIN


485
0:38:3,39 --> 0:38:6,85
THINGS I WANTED TO MENTION ABOUT. AND REMEMBER
THE CARPEL


486
0:38:6,85 --> 0:38:10,39
DEVELOPS, OR THE PISTIL OR THE CARPEL DEVELOPS
INTO FRUIT WHICH


487
0:38:10,39 --> 0:38:13,51
IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT FEATURE OF ANGIOSPERMS
IN TERMS OF


488
0:38:13,51 --> 0:38:18,18
DISPERSAL. THE MATURE OVARY, AND SOMETIMES
OTHER PARTS,


489
0:38:18,18 --> 0:38:23,12
ACCESSORY TISSUES OF ONE OR MORE FLOWERS BECOMES
A DISPERSAL UNIT


490
0:38:23,12 --> 0:38:31,83
OFTENTIMES. ALL RIGHT. AND I JUST MENTIONED
THEN POLLINATION


491
0:38:31,83 --> 0:38:35,2
IN FLOWERING PLANTS INVOLVING SOME SORT OF
ATTRACTANT OR


492
0:38:35,2 --> 0:38:38,93
ADVERTISEMENT. SO REMEMBER POLLINATION INVOLVES
A, MINIMALLY AN


493
0:38:38,93 --> 0:38:43,59
ATTRACTANT OR AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR A POLLINATOR,
IF IT'S ANIMAL


494
0:38:43,59 --> 0:38:43,59



495
0:38:43,59 --> 0:38:46,91
POLLINATION. THERE IS WIND POLLINATION IN
ANGIOSPERMS. IT'S


496
0:38:46,91 --> 0:38:52,5
DERIVED FROM, FROM ANIMAL POLLINATION. BUT
WHERE WE DO GET


497
0:38:52,5 --> 0:38:55,69
BIOTIC OR ANIMAL POLLINATION THERE'S AN ATTRACTANT.
AND


498
0:38:55,69 --> 0:38:58,84
SOMETIMES THERE'S A REWARD, BUT NOT ALWAYS.
I TALKED ABOUT


499
0:38:58,84 --> 0:39:3,9
DECEIT POLLINATION WITH FLY POLLINATION AND
THE BEE ORCHIDS AND


500
0:39:3,9 --> 0:39:7,1
THERE ARE SOME OTHER EXAMPLES TOO. BUT USUALLY
THERE'S A REWARD


501
0:39:7,1 --> 0:39:11,73
OF SOME KIND. AND REMEMBER I SPENT SOME TIME
TALKING ABOUT


502
0:39:11,73 --> 0:39:14,99
DIFFERENT POLLINATION SYNDROMES THAT, WHERE
THERE SEEMS TO HAVE


503
0:39:14,99 --> 0:39:19,1
BEEN CO-EVOLUTION OR AT LEAST ON THE SITE
OF THE PLANT WITH


504
0:39:19,1 --> 0:39:22,89
REGARD TO DIFFERENT KINDS OF POLLINATORS.
SO YOU SHOULD STUDY


505
0:39:22,89 --> 0:39:27,57
THOSE TOO, THOSE POLLINATION SYNDROMES, FOR
EXAMPLE LIKE FLY


506
0:39:27,57 --> 0:39:34,9
POLLINATION, BEE POLLINATION, THAT SORT OF
THING. QUESTIONS ON


507
0:39:34,9 --> 0:39:42,18
ANY OF THAT? ALL RIGHT, AND THEN AGAIN, THE
MALE GAMETOPHYTE AND


508
0:39:42,18 --> 0:39:45,61
FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE EVEN BECOMING MORE REDUCED
IN THE FLOWERING


509
0:39:45,61 --> 0:39:51,54
PLANTS THAN IN THE, THAN IN THE CONIFERS.
SO THE POLLEN OF, OF


510
0:39:51,54 --> 0:39:58,32
ANGIOSPERMS, FLOWERING PLANTS IS ONLY COMPRISED
OF TWO CELLS AT


511
0:39:58,32 --> 0:40:3,58
THE TIME OF, OF DISPERSAL. AND THEN LATER
THE GENERATIVE CELL


512
0:40:3,58 --> 0:40:8,96
UNDERGOES MITOSIS TO GIVE RISE TO TWO SPERMS.
SO WE JUST HAVE


513
0:40:8,96 --> 0:40:12,77
THE BARE MINIMUM NUMBER OF CELLS TO MAKE THIS
THING WORK AS AN


514
0:40:12,77 --> 0:40:19,88
ORGANISM TO GROW THE POLLEN TUBE AND, AND
TO FERTILIZE BOTH THE


515
0:40:19,88 --> 0:40:27,95
EGG AND, THE OTHER SPERM REMEMBER FUSES WITH
THE TWO POLAR NUCLEI


516
0:40:27,95 --> 0:40:31,33
OF THE FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE THAT BECOME THE
ENDOSPERM, THE


517
0:40:31,33 --> 0:40:35,25
NUTRITIVE TISSUE. SO THE ANGIOSPERMS WAIT
TO INVEST IN THEIR


518
0:40:35,25 --> 0:40:38,85
NUTRITIVE TISSUE UNTIL AFTER FERTILIZATION
HAS HAPPENED. SO


519
0:40:38,85 --> 0:40:41,56
THAT'S A REALLY, PROBABLY A VERY IMPORTANT
INNOVATION IN TERMS


520
0:40:41,56 --> 0:40:45,14



521
0:40:45,14 --> 0:40:48,67
OF, OF YOU KNOW CONSERVING RESOURCES UNTIL
THEY'RE NEEDED. SO,


522
0:40:48,67 --> 0:40:59,83
THAT'S A POINT ABOUT REWARD AND POLLINATION.
AND AGAIN THE


523
0:40:59,83 --> 0:41:4,28
FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE HIGHLY REDUCED BY COMPARISON
WITH THE CONIFER


524
0:41:4,28 --> 0:41:9,73
OR THE PINE FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE. JUST A FEW
CELLS, TYPICALLY


525
0:41:9,73 --> 0:41:17,65
ABOUT SEVEN AND EIGHT NUCLEI. AGAIN THOSE
TWO POLAR NUCLEI HERE


526
0:41:17,65 --> 0:41:20,25
UNDERGO FUSION WITH ONE OF THE SPERM TO PRODUCE
THE ENDOSPERM


527
0:41:20,25 --> 0:41:24,66
MOTHER CELL THAT GOES ON TO UNDERGO MITOSES
TO GIVE RISE TO


528
0:41:24,66 --> 0:41:29,4
TRIPLOID. AND THIS IS TRIPLOID TISSUE. NOT
DIPLOID OR HAPLOID


529
0:41:29,4 --> 0:41:35,79
BUT 3N BECAUSE TWO NUCLEI OF THE FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE
FUSED WITH


530
0:41:35,79 --> 0:41:40,1
ONE OF THE SPERM. SO YOU GET THREE GENOMES
TOGETHER HERE. AND


531
0:41:40,1 --> 0:41:47,89
THAT NOURISHES THE ZYGOTE AND THE, THE DEVELOPING
EMBRYO.


532
0:41:47,89 --> 0:41:50,36
THOUGH THIS DOUBLE FERTILIZATION PROCESS IS
THOUGHT TO BE ANOTHER


533
0:41:50,36 --> 0:41:54,34
REALLY IMPORTANT INNOVATION TO THE FLOWERING
PLANTS IN TERMS OF


534
0:41:54,34 --> 0:41:57,4
WAITING TO PRODUCE THE NUTRITIVE TISSUE UNTIL
AFTER


535
0:41:57,4 --> 0:42:5,81
FERTILIZATION.


536
0:42:5,81 --> 0:42:7,54
OKAY, SO THEN I ALSO TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT


537
0:42:7,54 --> 0:42:11,44
FRUIT, SO DO STUDY THOSE FRUIT TYPES. I TALKED
ABOUT THOSE


538
0:42:11,44 --> 0:42:18,37
DIFFERENT FRUIT TYPES. AND ALSO TALKED ABOUT,
SO YEAH, I MEAN


539
0:42:18,37 --> 0:42:21,61
THERE WERE VARIOUS TYPES OF DISPERSAL WE TALKED
ABOUT INVOLVING


540
0:42:21,61 --> 0:42:27,32
SEEDS OR WHOLE FRUITS OR PLANTS, BOTH ABIOTIC
AND BIOTIC, BOTH BY


541
0:42:27,32 --> 0:42:34,52
ANIMAL AND BY PHYSICAL FORCES. AND I ALSO
TALKED ABOUT


542
0:42:34,52 --> 0:42:38,7
MECHANISMS AGAINST SELFING IN FLOWERING PLANTS.
I DON'T HAVE A


543
0:42:38,7 --> 0:42:42,14
SLIDE HERE TO SHOW YOU THAT BUT REMEMBER WE
TALKED ABOUT THINGS


544
0:42:42,14 --> 0:42:47,61
LIKE SPATIAL SEPARATION OF THE, OF THE STIGMA
AND THE STAMENS.


545
0:42:47,61 --> 0:42:54,15
DIFFERENTIAL TIMING OF MATURATION OF STAMENS
AND PISTOLS.


546
0:42:54,15 --> 0:42:57,95
UNISEXUAL, EVOLUTION OF UNISEXUAL OR I SHOULD
SAY EVOLUTION OF


547
0:42:57,95 --> 0:42:57,95



548
0:42:57,95 --> 0:43:3,12
PISTILLATE FUNCTION OCCURRING ON ONLY ONE
SPOROPHYTE AND


549
0:43:3,12 --> 0:43:5,98
STAMINATE FUNCTION ON ANOTHER SPOROPHYTE.
THE DIOECIOUS


550
0:43:5,98 --> 0:43:9,76
CONDITION. THINGS LIKE THAT. MAKE SURE TO
REVIEW THOSE


551
0:43:9,76 --> 0:43:13,71
IMPORTANT FEATURES IN TERMS OF MINIMIZING
SELF-POLLINATION,


552
0:43:13,71 --> 0:43:20,19
SELF-FERTILIZATION. AND THIS IS THAT FIGURE
THAT I MENTIONED


553
0:43:20,19 --> 0:43:24,85
THAT SHOW SOME OF THE IMPORTANT CHANGES WE
SEE IN THE, IN THE


554
0:43:24,85 --> 0:43:30,74
LAND PLANTS. SO HERE WE HAVE THE BRYOPHYTES
AGAIN. AND HERE


555
0:43:30,74 --> 0:43:35,74
ARE THE LAND, THE VASCULAR PLANTS. AND HERE
ARE THE FLOWERING


556
0:43:35,74 --> 0:43:40,13
PLANTS. SO AGAIN THE ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS
IS SOMETHING


557
0:43:40,13 --> 0:43:45,94
ALL THE LAND PLANTS SHARE. BUT AFTER THE LAND
PLANTS DIVERGE


558
0:43:45,94 --> 0:43:51,19
FROM THE GREEN ALGAE, THE CLOSEST FRESHWATER
GREEN ALGAE HERE, WE


559
0:43:51,19 --> 0:43:57,93
HAVE GAMETANGIA EVOLVING, SO ARCHEGONIA AND
ANTHERIDIA. WE


560
0:43:57,93 --> 0:44:1,24
ACTUALLY HAVE EMBRYOS EVOLVE. SO THESE ARE
ALL CALLED THE


561
0:44:1,24 --> 0:44:6,52
EMBRYOPHYTES. THAT'S ANOTHER NAME FOR ALL
THE LAND PLANTS. AND


562
0:44:6,52 --> 0:44:13,91
REMEMBER THE TRUE VASCULAR TISSUE EVOLVED
IN THE SPOROPHYTES OF


563
0:44:13,91 --> 0:44:18,8
THE VASCULAR PLANTS. WE DON'T GET TRUE VASCULAR
TISSUE IN THE


564
0:44:18,8 --> 0:44:23,89
BRYOPHYTES. TRUE ROOTS EVOLVE IN THE TRUE
VASCULAR PLANTS. THE


565
0:44:23,89 --> 0:44:30,23
BRYOPHYTES DON'T HAVE TRUE ROOTS. AND AS I
MENTIONED THERE IS


566
0:44:30,23 --> 0:44:34,84
HETEROSPORY THAT EVOLVED IN OTHER PLACES OTHER
THAN JUST IN THE


567
0:44:34,84 --> 0:44:38,43
SEED PLANTS BUT THE SEED PLANTS EVOLVE FROM
HETEROSPOROUS


568
0:44:38,43 --> 0:44:44,35
ANCESTORS. AND WE HAVE THIS REDUCTION IN THE
GAMETOPHYTES


569
0:44:44,35 --> 0:44:49,27
EVENTUALLY RESULTING IN THE LOSS OF THE ANTHERIDIA.
THE POLLEN


570
0:44:49,27 --> 0:44:53,21
DOESN'T HAVE ANTHERIDIA. AND IN THE FLOWERING
PLANTS WE'VE EVEN


571
0:44:53,21 --> 0:44:58,48
LOST THE ARCHEGONIUM AND WE HAVE DOUBLE FERTILIZATION.
THE


572
0:44:58,48 --> 0:45:3,69
CARPEL HERE AND THE EVOLUTION OF FRUIT. THOUGH
THAT JUST


573
0:45:3,69 --> 0:45:3,69



574
0:45:3,69 --> 0:45:9,61
REITERATES SOME OTHER POINTS ALREADY MADE.
OKAY SO OTHER THINGS


575
0:45:9,61 --> 0:45:16,47
TO STUDY, WE GET INTO STRUCTURE HERE, SO YOU
SHOULD BE AWARE OF


576
0:45:16,47 --> 0:45:18,82
THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN DETERMINATE AND INDETERMINATE
GROWTH.


577
0:45:18,82 --> 0:45:25,46
ALL RIGHT, SO STEMS AND ROOTS UNDERGO INDETERMINATE
GROWTH. AND


578
0:45:25,46 --> 0:45:29,88
THEY HAVE GROWTH FROM THE APICAL MERISTEM,
THE PRIMARY GROWTH


579
0:45:29,88 --> 0:45:33,61
THAT RESULTS IN LENGTHENING, BOTH THE APICAL
MERISTEM OF THE


580
0:45:33,61 --> 0:45:39,67
SHOOT AS WELL AS THE ROOTS. BUT LEAVES HAVE
DETERMINATE GROWTH


581
0:45:39,67 --> 0:45:44,5
TYPICALLY. THEY ONLY, THE MERISTEMS AND LEAVES
LAST ONLY A


582
0:45:44,5 --> 0:45:47,84
BRIEF TIME UNTIL THE LEAF IS FULLY FORMED.
AND THE SAME GOES


583
0:45:47,84 --> 0:45:53,48
WITH THE FLOWER. REMEMBER THE FLOWER IS A
DETERMINATE SHOOT


584
0:45:53,48 --> 0:45:56,24
AFTER THE PISTOLS ARE FORMED. IT DOESN'T CONTINUE
TO DEVELOP.


585
0:45:56,24 --> 0:46:1,3
IT TERMINATES. BUT INDETERMINATE GROWTH IS
THIS WHOLE, WHAT WE


586
0:46:1,3 --> 0:46:5,76
SEE WHICH IS SO DIFFERENT FROM ANIMALS WHERE
HAVE THESE TISSUES


587
0:46:5,76 --> 0:46:10,6
THAT CONTINUE TO BE, THESE GROWING POINTS
THAT CONTINUE TO


588
0:46:10,6 --> 0:46:13,49
DEVELOP AND THOSE INCLUDE NOT ONLY APICAL
MERISTEMS AND PRIMARY


589
0:46:13,49 --> 0:46:20,1
GROWTH BUT LATERAL MERISTEMS AND SECONDARY
GROWTH OF EUDICOTS,


590
0:46:20,1 --> 0:46:23,4
CONIFERS, BUT NOT MONOCOTS. REMEMBER MONOCOTS
DON'T HAVE


591
0:46:23,4 --> 0:46:27,59
SECONDARY GROWTH. SO BE AWARE OF BOTH TYPES
OF LATERAL


592
0:46:27,59 --> 0:46:32,97
MERISTEMS, THE VASCULAR CAMBIUM AND THE CORK
CAMBIUM THAT ARE


593
0:46:32,97 --> 0:46:37,33
BOTH RESULTING IN THICKENING GROWTH. INCREASE
IN THE AMOUNT OF


594
0:46:37,33 --> 0:46:40,74
VASCULAR TISSUE IN THE CASE OF THE VASCULAR
CAMBIUM. INCREASE


595
0:46:40,74 --> 0:46:45,69
IN THE AMOUNT OF DERMAL TISSUE IN THE CASE
OF THE CORK CAMBIUM.


596
0:46:45,69 --> 0:46:56,3
OKAY WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME LEFT. BUT SO
REVIEW CELL TYPES AND


597
0:46:56,3 --> 0:47:0,66
TISSUE SYSTEMS. THERE ARE JUST A FEW OF EACH.
AND BE FAMILIAR


598
0:47:0,66 --> 0:47:3,91
WITH THOSE. REMEMBER WE TALKED ABOUT PARENCHYMA,
COLLENCHYMA,


599
0:47:3,91 --> 0:47:3,91



600
0:47:3,91 --> 0:47:8,76
SCLERENCHYMA, VASCULAR TISSUE OF WHICH WE
HAVE A COUPLE OF TYPES,


601
0:47:8,76 --> 0:47:17,6
PHLOEM AND XYLEM, AND THOSE CELL TYPES. MODIFIED
STRUCTURES, I


602
0:47:17,6 --> 0:47:21,14
TALKED ABOUT MODIFIED ROOTS, MODIFIED STEMS,
MODIFIED LEAVES.


603
0:47:21,14 --> 0:47:24,23
YOU SHOULD BE FAMILIAR WITH THOSE AND BE ABLE
TO SAY WHICH IS A


604
0:47:24,23 --> 0:47:30,54
LEAF, WHICH IS A STEM, WHICH IS A ROOT. AND
AGAIN THE TYPES OF


605
0:47:30,54 --> 0:47:36,97
MERISTEMS, LATERAL MERISTEMS, FOR EXAMPLE.
SOME OF THE


606
0:47:36,97 --> 0:47:41,58
CONSEQUENCES OF SECONDARY GROWTH IN TERMS
OF, YOU KNOW THIS


607
0:47:41,58 --> 0:47:45,34
THICKENING GROWTH AND WHAT, THERE ARE SOME
SLIDES THAT HAD TO DO


608
0:47:45,34 --> 0:47:53,43
WITH THAT. I TALKED ABOUT NUTRIENTS BRIEFLY
SO MOBILE VERSUS


609
0:47:53,43 --> 0:47:57,76
IMMOBILE NUTRIENTS. I'M NOT EXPECTING YOU
TO MEMORIZE ALL OF


610
0:47:57,76 --> 0:48:1,15
THE DIFFERENT MACRO AND MICRONUTRIENTS. BUT
REALIZE THERE ARE


611
0:48:1,15 --> 0:48:10,18
MACRONUTRIENTS AND MICRONUTRIENTS. THE CASPARIAN
STRIP HERE IN


612
0:48:10,18 --> 0:48:14,9
THE ENDODERMIS AND ITS IMPORTANCE FOR SERVING
AS A BUFFER,


613
0:48:14,9 --> 0:48:19,49
SERVING AS A BARRIER TO MOVEMENT FROM THE
SOIL, MOVEMENT OF


614
0:48:19,49 --> 0:48:23,97
SOLUTES AND SUBSTANCES FROM THE SOIL INTO
THE VASCULAR TISSUE.


615
0:48:23,97 --> 0:48:33,12
WE TALKED QUITE A BIT ABOUT THIS. AND I ALSO
TALKED ABOUT,


616
0:48:33,12 --> 0:48:36,8
WELL, WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT MYCORRHIZAL.
WE TALKED ABOUT WATER


617
0:48:36,8 --> 0:48:40,68
POTENTIAL AND THE IMPORTANCE OF WATER POTENTIAL
IN TERMS OF


618
0:48:40,68 --> 0:48:45,23
MOVEMENT OF WATER, FREE ENERGY OF WATER, SO
WATER GOES FROM HIGH


619
0:48:45,23 --> 0:48:48,91
WATER POTENTIAL TO LOW WATER POTENTIAL. IT'S
GOING TO, WE


620
0:48:48,91 --> 0:48:54,52
TALKED ABOUT OSMOSIS, VERY SIMILAR PRINCIPLES.
AND HOW WATER'S


621
0:48:54,52 --> 0:48:59,14
TRANSPORTED IN THE XYLEM VERSUS THE PHLOEM,
REMEMBER? SO HERE


622
0:48:59,14 --> 0:49:4,34
IT'S NEGATIVE PRESSURE BASICALLY THAT'S PULLING
THE WATER UP


623
0:49:4,34 --> 0:49:8,8
WHEREAS HERE WE HAVE POSITIVE, POSITIVE PRESSURE
PUSHING THE


624
0:49:8,8 --> 0:49:16,79
PHLOEM THROUGH THE SIEVE TUBES. SO DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN PASSIVE


625
0:49:16,79 --> 0:49:16,79



626
0:49:16,79 --> 0:49:21,43
AND ACTIVE TRANSPORT VERSUS BULK FLOW. REMEMBER
PASSIVE AND


627
0:49:21,43 --> 0:49:25,55
ACTIVE TRANSPORT IS MOVEMENT ACROSS A MEMBRANE.
BULK FLOW IS


628
0:49:25,55 --> 0:49:28,1
NOT. IT'S MOVEMENT WITHIN TUBES AND WE HAVE
THESE TWO DIFFERENT


629
0:49:28,1 --> 0:49:34,7
TYPES HERE. AND PHOTOPERIODISM. I TALKED QUITE
A BIT ABOUT


630
0:49:34,7 --> 0:49:38,79
THAT. SO BE AWARE ABOUT PHOTOPERIODISM. YOU
SHOULD BE


631
0:49:38,79 --> 0:49:41,58
FAMILIAR WITH WHAT A SHORT DAY AND WHAT A
LONG-DAY PLANT ARE


632
0:49:41,58 --> 0:49:47,48
RESPONDING TO IN TERMS OF STIMULI TO FLOWER.
AND I TALKED, SO


633
0:49:47,48 --> 0:49:52,0
HAVE A GENERAL UNDERSTANDING ALSO OF HORMONE
ACTION. SO I


634
0:49:52,0 --> 0:49:56,91
TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF DOSAGE IN HORMONES,
THE IMPORTANCE


635
0:49:56,91 --> 0:50:0,85
OF HOW THEY CAN HAVE DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS
ON DIFFERENT TISSUES OR


636
0:50:0,85 --> 0:50:4,75
TISSUES OF DIFFERENT AGES OR YOU KNOW THE
DOSAGE CAN HAVE, MAKE,


637
0:50:4,75 --> 0:50:8,26
CAN RESULT IN A DIFFERENT EFFECT. AND THAT
THE BALANCE OF


638
0:50:8,26 --> 0:50:14,25
HORMONES IS REALLY IMPORTANT. SO THOSE WERE
SOME MAJOR POINTS.


639
0:50:14,25 --> 0:50:17,86
AND ALSO FINALLY, THE MAJOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
THE HORMONES AND


640
0:50:17,86 --> 0:50:21,2
THEIR PRIMARY ACTION. SO I HAD A LIST OF DIFFERENT
TYPES OF


641
0:50:21,2 --> 0:50:25,94
HORMONES AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THOSE
HORMONES ARE MOST


642
0:50:25,94 --> 0:50:29,58
IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF, WHAT KINDS OF RESPONSES
THEY TEND TO


643
0:50:29,58 --> 0:50:35,55
SIGNAL. ARE THERE ANY LAST QUESTIONS? OFFICE
HOURS I'M GOING


644
0:50:35,55 --> 0:50:38,79
TO CONTINUE TO HOLD THEM THROUGH, UP UNTIL
THE DAY OF THE FINAL


645
0:50:38,79 --> 0:50:42,58
SO YOU KNOW JUST, JUST COME WHEN YOU CAN IF
YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL


646
0:50:42,58 --> 0:50:44,42
QUESTIONS. OKAY.


647
0:50:44,42 --> 0:52:44,42
