actually shot a short film.

Ahmad also found another
use for the camera.


54
0:4:23,85 --> 0:4:26,86
Because it's nearly impossible
for him to get a job, he used


55
0:4:26,86 --> 0:4:29,85
the camera to shoot weddings
and engagement parties,


56
0:4:29,85 --> 0:4:32,17
birthday parties,
and get paid.


57

training, because his next
