CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: A warm welcome on this
Thursday, March 7, especially for anyone who`s


2
0:0:16,789 --> 0:0:22,29
dealing with this frosty reception. A winter
storm? Yes, another one hammered parts of


3
0:0:22,29 --> 0:0:27,27
the Midwestern and Northeastern United States
this week. Power outages, schools and businesses


4
0:0:27,27 --> 0:0:34,4
closed, flights canceled. Chicago had a record
one-day snowfall on Tuesday. CNN`s Ted Rowlands


5
0:0:34,4 --> 0:0:34,53
was there.


6
0:0:34,53 --> 0:0:34,96
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


7
0:0:34,96 --> 0:0:38,5
TED ROWLANDS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And this
is not only in Chicago. Of course, it`s hitting


8
0:0:38,5 --> 0:0:43,54
the Midwest, Minneapolis, North Dakota, getting
in excess of a foot of snow, and the system


9
0:0:43,54 --> 0:0:44,269
is heading east.


10
0:0:44,269 --> 0:0:49,379
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We`ve gotten our yardstick
out, and at least where I am, I`ve measured


11
0:0:49,379 --> 0:0:54,51
from place to place where it looked like the
snow was untouched, about six inches of snow


12
0:0:54,51 --> 0:1:1,2
so far. Right here in downtown Winchester,
although that`s by no means a scientific reading.


13
0:1:1,2 --> 0:1:5,61
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Many airlines canceled.
A number of flights, hundreds, in facts, and


14
0:1:5,61 --> 0:1:11,5
where I`m at Dulles is a big hub for United
Airlines as is Chicago`s O`Hare airports.


15
0:1:11,5 --> 0:1:14,56
So, United is taking a big hit. They canceled
about 700 flights.


16
0:1:14,56 --> 0:1:19,91
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The highest waves during
Sandy were maybe 40 miles an hour, but this


17
0:1:19,91 --> 0:1:25,13
time we are talking about 12 to 15 foot seas.
Now, you can see the damage that is still


18
0:1:25,13 --> 0:1:30,47
pretty clear about what happened during Hurricane
Sandy. Look, so many houses still have been


19
0:1:30,47 --> 0:1:32,479
destroyed or are heavily damaged.


20
0:1:32,479 --> 0:1:33,179
(END VIDEOTAPE)


21
0:1:33,179 --> 0:1:34,22
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


22
0:1:34,22 --> 0:1:40,0
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is this legit? Members
of OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting


23
0:1:40,0 --> 0:1:43,5
Countries, are all Middle Eastern nations.


24
0:1:43,5 --> 0:1:51,3
Not true. OPEC includes countries from Africa
and South America, too.


25
0:1:51,3 --> 0:1:54,459
(END VIDEO CLIP)


26
0:1:54,459 --> 0:1:59,7
AZUZ: Like Venezuela, a country of more than
28 million people that`s in the northern part


27
0:1:59,7 --> 0:2:4,86
of South America. Oil is huge part of Venezuela`s
economy. It`s one of the biggest industries


28
0:2:4,86 --> 0:2:9,64
in the country, that`s responsible for roughly
95 percent of all the money that Venezuela


29
0:2:9,64 --> 0:2:14,53
earns by selling products to other nations.
Venezuela`s in the middle of seven days of


30
0:2:14,53 --> 0:2:18,84
mourning. The country`s long time leader,
Hugo Chavez, died this week. His casket was


31
0:2:18,84 --> 0:2:23,75
moved to a military academy yesterday. That`s
where his state funeral is scheduled to happen


32
0:2:23,75 --> 0:2:29,25
tomorrow. Venezuela will set a date to elect
a new leader in the next 30 days. During this


33
0:2:29,25 --> 0:2:33,42
time, as President Hugo Chavez`s supporters
argue that he gave Venezuelans the sense of


34
0:2:33,42 --> 0:2:38,78
national pride. His critics argue that Chavez
ruined this country`s economy and restricted


35
0:2:38,78 --> 0:2:42,82
people`s liberties. Controversy plays a large
role in Chavez`s legacy.


36
0:2:42,82 --> 0:2:43,84
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


37
0:2:43,84 --> 0:2:45,88
HUGO CHAVEZ: Victoria! Victoria!


38
0:2:45,88 --> 0:2:51,12
AZUZ: He relished being at the center of controversy.
So, it`s no wonder his friends and foes had


39
0:2:51,12 --> 0:2:53,13
very different takes on the Chavez legacy.


40
0:2:53,13 --> 0:2:59,84
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He`s made Venezuelans
feel proud to be Venezuelan again. And not


41
0:2:59,84 --> 0:3:3,93
as something, I think that really no other
leader has ever done in that country before.


42
0:3:3,93 --> 0:3:5,41
In fact, they were doing the opposite.


43
0:3:5,41 --> 0:3:11,84
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He`s destroyed the economy
and centralized all power in his hands, decimated


44
0:3:11,84 --> 0:3:17,81
the democratic institutions in the country
and left Venezuelan democracy in even worse


45
0:3:17,81 --> 0:3:20,92
shape. So it`s a pretty negative legacy.


46
0:3:20,92 --> 0:3:26,19
AZUZ: Chavez`s rhetoric often aimed at the
United States or at multinational corporations.


47
0:3:26,19 --> 0:3:31,25
It invoked the promise of a socialist utopia,
but Hugo Chavez had what most other Latin


48
0:3:31,25 --> 0:3:37,15
American leftists did not - oil. Venezuela
has the largest oil reserves in the world,


49
0:3:37,15 --> 0:3:43,5
along with Saudi Arabia. That oil wealth enabled
Chavez to offer up free education and healthcare


50
0:3:43,5 --> 0:3:48,84
in his own country. The price of his socialist
agenda - Hugo Chavez himself, presidential


51
0:3:48,84 --> 0:3:53,459
term limits were abolished. Even his critics
admit, he could have gone on winning elections


52
0:3:53,459 --> 0:3:59,97
indefinitely. His biggest failure maybe his
success, a legacy of one. Friends and foes,


53
0:3:59,97 --> 0:4:2,54
the Chavez legacy is filled with both.


54
0:4:2,54 --> 0:4:4,33
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


55
0:4:4,33 --> 0:4:10,76
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See if you can I.D. me.
I`m a type of vehicle that`s been around for


56
0:4:10,76 --> 0:4:16,739
more than 100 years. My name comes from a
Latin word that refers to a combination of


57
0:4:16,739 --> 0:4:27,11
things. In my case, that`s internal combustion
engine and an electric motor. I`m a hybrid.


58
0:4:27,11 --> 0:4:30,86
A vehicle that runs on fuel and electricity.


59
0:4:30,86 --> 0:4:32,45
(END VIDEO CLIP)


60
0:4:32,45 --> 0:4:38,85
AZUZ: Volkswagen is coming out with a new
hybrid car that the company claims would get


61
0:4:38,85 --> 0:4:44,99
the equivalent of 261 miles per gallon. Considering
that the standard Toyota Prius gets around


62
0:4:44,99 --> 0:4:50,76
50, this is significant. But this doesn`t
mean that the XL 1, as it`s being called,


63
0:4:50,76 --> 0:4:55,85
will get you across the country without stopping.
Between battery and diesel power, VW says,


64
0:4:55,85 --> 0:5:1,59
it will go about 310 miles total, which is
about 90 miles less than your average sedan


65
0:5:1,59 --> 0:5:7,6
on a full tank of gas. But the XL 1`s engine
only needs about 2.6 gallons of diesel to


66
0:5:7,6 --> 0:5:13,58
fill it. So, a fill-up at today`s prices would
cost about 11 bucks. It`s incredibly aerodynamic,


67
0:5:13,58 --> 0:5:19,16
significantly more so than a Chevy Corvette,
for example, and it certainly looks futuristic.


68
0:5:19,16 --> 0:5:24,24
But it`s not fast. It will take over 12 seconds
to get you from zero to 60. Its top speed


69
0:5:24,24 --> 0:5:28,54
will be about 100 miles per hour, though,
of course, none of us would ever drive that


70
0:5:28,54 --> 0:5:33,32
fast. It`s also not expected to be cheap,
and it may not even be available in the U.S.


71
0:5:33,32 --> 0:5:39,8
But Europeans, who want fuel mileage bragging
rights and can still afford the car, may have


72
0:5:39,8 --> 0:5:41,33
something to brag about.


73
0:5:41,33 --> 0:5:45,169
One week ago, we told you about Jhaquiel Reagan.
While he was walking to a job interview, he


74
0:5:45,169 --> 0:5:49,699
made an impression on a local restaurant owner
and got a job there. It is a great story about


75
0:5:49,699 --> 0:5:54,669
one person`s work ethic, but it`s not the
end of the story, and it`s not the end of


76
0:5:54,669 --> 0:6:0,15
Jhaquiel`s impressive display of character.
WXIN`s Kent Erdahl picks up the story.


77
0:6:0,15 --> 0:6:0,99
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


78
0:6:0,99 --> 0:6:5,26
KENT ERDAHL, WXIN CORRESPONDENT: Jhaquiel
Reagan has met a lot of people since setting


79
0:6:5,26 --> 0:6:9,729
off on a ten-mile to a job interview days
ago, an interview that he wouldn`t even end


80
0:6:9,729 --> 0:6:13,18
up needing after meeting the owner of Papa
Ru on his way.


81
0:6:13,18 --> 0:6:17,52
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I`m thinking to myself,
here`s a kid walking almost ten miles in ice


82
0:6:17,52 --> 0:6:22,54
and slush and snow for the hope of a job at
minimum wage, just like the kind of story


83
0:6:22,54 --> 0:6:26,11
your parent used to tell - my parents used
to tell - uphill both ways in the snow.


84
0:6:26,11 --> 0:6:30,7
ERDAHL: Jhaquiel`s stories also now stuff
of legend - he`s been immortalized in his


85
0:6:30,7 --> 0:6:35,43
own editorial cartoon and seen his picture
pop up on stories he can begin to translate.


86
0:6:35,43 --> 0:6:38,9
JHAQUIEL REAGAN: People all over the globe
see me. It`s really crazy.


87
0:6:38,9 --> 0:6:43,2
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The story, as one of my
customers put it, is redefining viral.


88
0:6:43,2 --> 0:6:46,71
ERDAHL: That`s because it`s generated more
than just likes on Facebook. It`s created


89
0:6:46,71 --> 0:6:48,4
a new life for Jhaquiel.


90
0:6:48,4 --> 0:6:53,37
REAGAN: It really has changed quick. Like
I went from sleeping on the couch to sleeping


91
0:6:53,37 --> 0:6:55,47
in my own house - in my own apartment.


92
0:6:55,47 --> 0:7:0,9
ERDAHL: You see, before meeting his new landlord,
Jhaquiel was homeless and living with friends.


93
0:7:0,9 --> 0:7:1,4
He also didn`t have a phone.


94
0:7:1,4 --> 0:7:2,44
REAGAN: I was trying to get a hold of you
last night.


95
0:7:2,44 --> 0:7:7,259
ERDAHL: Now, he is taking calls from the Chicago
Bulls organization. They contacted him after


96
0:7:7,259 --> 0:7:9,8
seeing a certain hat on TV.


97
0:7:9,8 --> 0:7:15,16
REAGAN: They gave me some tickets to the Bulls.
I was really impressed. It`s awesome.


98
0:7:15,16 --> 0:7:19,97
ERDAHL: As we showed you last week, Jhaquiel
also received a free bus pass, though he hasn`t


99
0:7:19,97 --> 0:7:24,66
had to use it much after meeting plenty of
coworkers who have offered to give him rights.


100
0:7:24,66 --> 0:7:27,9
REAGAN: I really appreciated. Really grateful.


101
0:7:27,9 --> 0:7:30,78
ERDAHL: Jhaquiel`s story didn`t just give
him a job. In fact, they`ve gotten so much


102
0:7:30,78 --> 0:7:35,75
good publicity here at Papa Ru, that they`ve
actually had to hire additional stuff to keep


103
0:7:35,75 --> 0:7:37,449
up with all the extra demand.


104
0:7:37,449 --> 0:7:39,46
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We`ve got five new permanent
hires.


105
0:7:39,46 --> 0:7:41,5
ERDAHL: Some of them spend time answering
phones.


106
0:7:41,5 --> 0:7:43,949
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My cashiers have turned
into receptionists.


107
0:7:43,949 --> 0:7:47,58
ERDAHL: Fielding dozens of donation requests
for Jhaquiel.


108
0:7:47,58 --> 0:7:52,11
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Each slip is an individual
contact of a person with a name and a number,


109
0:7:52,11 --> 0:7:55,6
and they want to help financially, each of
these slips.


110
0:7:55,6 --> 0:7:59,99
EDRAHL: In fact, so many donations have come
in that Jhaquiel decided to create his own


111
0:7:59,99 --> 0:8:4,68
foundation, saying half the money will go
to help disadvantage people find work. The


112
0:8:4,68 --> 0:8:8,9
other half will go to him, but he`ll be sharing
it with the most important people he`s met


113
0:8:8,9 --> 0:8:9,86
in the past days.


114
0:8:9,86 --> 0:8:16,46
REAGAN: 25 percent of my half is going to
Papa Ru employees. Because they have been


115
0:8:16,46 --> 0:8:20,5
working their fingers to the bone while all
of this has been going on. The restaurant


116
0:8:20,5 --> 0:8:27,289
has been more busy than it has ever been.
And, you know, they really deserve it, you


117
0:8:27,289 --> 0:8:27,9
know.


118
0:8:27,9 --> 0:8:29,139
(END VIDEOTAPE)


119
0:8:29,139 --> 0:8:34,38
AZUZ: Are teenagers getting tired of Facebook?
Just about everyone who tweeted me about this,


120
0:8:34,38 --> 0:8:39,509
said yes. A couple of new reports say Facebook`s
younger users might be leaving for other sites


121
0:8:39,509 --> 0:8:45,129
and apps like Twitter, Snapchat and Instagram.
Facebook still gained millions of users last


122
0:8:45,129 --> 0:8:49,779
year, and the company owns Instagram, but
many teenagers are turned off by the number


123
0:8:49,779 --> 0:8:54,6
of parents on Facebook and privacy factors
in it, too. Graham said on our Facebook page,


124
0:8:54,6 --> 0:8:59,42
he is posting less because he worries about
colleges or potential employers seeing it.


125
0:8:59,42 --> 0:9:5,139
Students on Facebook can talk to us there.
Teachers, you can talk to us at cnnstudentnews.com.


126
0:9:5,139 --> 0:9:7,91
Please let us know your thoughts on today`s
show.


127
0:9:7,91 --> 0:9:12,499
Something you may not know about me. I can
juggle - not well. So already I thought this


128
0:9:12,499 --> 0:9:18,19
Youtube video was impressive. But watch this
guy`s left hand and listen closely.


129
0:9:18,19 --> 0:9:26,639
You noticed what`s going on there? Every time
he catches the cube, he is moving its pieces.


130
0:9:26,639 --> 0:9:30,259
The only way I ever solved a Rubik`s cube
was by taking the stickers off and moving


131
0:9:30,259 --> 0:9:35,91
them around. This guy is doing it one-handed
while he juggles. Show off. We`d suggest like


132
0:9:35,91 --> 0:9:40,439
a mic drop, but it doesn`t look he ever drops
anything. We are going to grade that performance,


133
0:9:40,439 --> 0:9:44,199
but we didn`t have a good Rubik for it. He
posted that video right before Valentine`s


134
0:9:44,199 --> 0:9:47,569
day. You might think that`s puzzling, but
it was just in time for Cupid, and if he ever


135
0:9:47,569 --> 0:9:50,92
takes his show on the road, I just hope he
stays safe, because it can be a real juggle


136
0:9:50,92 --> 0:11:50,92
out there. I`m Carl Azuz, enjoy the rest of
your day.
