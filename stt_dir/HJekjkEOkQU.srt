2
0:0:0,12 --> 0:0:1,869
JULIE WISKIRCHEN: So
I'm Julie Wiskirchen.


3
0:0:1,869 --> 0:0:4,25
I'm from the authors team
here at Google Los Angeles.


4
0:0:4,25 --> 0:0:7,562
And today I'm very excited
to welcome Dean Koontz.


5
0:0:7,562 --> 0:0:9,5
When Dean was a
senior in college,


6
0:0:9,5 --> 0:0:11,96
he won an "Atlantic Monthly"
fiction competition,


7
0:0:11,96 --> 0:0:13,95
and he's been
writing ever since.


8
0:0:13,95 --> 0:0:16,219
He's one of the world's
most iconic writers,


9
0:0:16,219 --> 0:0:18,27
with books published
in 38 languages,


10
0:0:18,27 --> 0:0:21,85
and has sold over
450 million copies.


11
0:0:21,85 --> 0:0:23,74
14 of his novels have
risen to number one


12
0:0:23,74 --> 0:0:26,19
on the "New York Times"
hardcover best-seller list,


13
0:0:26,19 --> 0:0:28,19
making him one of only
a dozen writers ever


14
0:0:28,19 --> 0:0:30,189
to achieve that milestone.


15
0:0:30,189 --> 0:0:31,98
The "New York Times"
has called his writing


16
0:0:31,98 --> 0:0:35,48
psychologically complex,
masterly, and satisfying.


17
0:0:35,48 --> 0:0:37,99
"Rolling Stone" has hailed
him as America's most popular


18
0:0:37,99 --> 0:0:39,95
suspense novelist.


19
0:0:39,95 --> 0:0:41,89
Dean's new novel is
called "Innocence,"


20
0:0:41,89 --> 0:0:44,142
and he's going to
discuss it with us today.


21
0:0:44,142 --> 0:0:46,1
So please join me in
giving a very warm welcome


22
0:0:46,1 --> 0:0:47,682
to Dean Koontz.


23
0:0:47,682 --> 0:0:50,598
[APPLAUSE]


24
0:0:50,598 --> 0:0:53,3
DEAN KOONTZ: Thank you.


25
0:0:53,3 --> 0:0:55,37
I normally stand at
a podium and speak,


26
0:0:55,37 --> 0:0:57,95
so this is a little
more relaxed.


27
0:0:57,95 --> 0:0:59,54
I don't have my
notes in front of me,


28
0:0:59,54 --> 0:1:1,98
so it'll be more confusing.


29
0:1:1,98 --> 0:1:5,63
But hopefully-- and we'll try to
make it more with some question


30
0:1:5,63 --> 0:1:7,38
and answer as we go.


31
0:1:7,38 --> 0:1:9,32
And maybe I can
mingle some stories


32
0:1:9,32 --> 0:1:11,67
in about things that
have happened to me.


33
0:1:11,67 --> 0:1:13,25
Normally when I
speak, I just talk


34
0:1:13,25 --> 0:1:16,6
about stupid things that
I've done during my career,


35
0:1:16,6 --> 0:1:17,89
or stupid things that
have happened to me.


36
0:1:17,89 --> 0:1:20,99
And I have files and
files of stupid stories


37
0:1:20,99 --> 0:1:22,17
of things I've done.


38
0:1:22,17 --> 0:1:25,426
So I usually have no
shortage of material.


39
0:1:25,426 --> 0:1:27,3
But I thought today,
since this is different,


40
0:1:27,3 --> 0:1:29,5
I'd probably tell you
a little about where


41
0:1:29,5 --> 0:1:32,67
I came from, a little bit
about where I grew up,


42
0:1:32,67 --> 0:1:36,6
and some things that
happened to me that probably


43
0:1:36,6 --> 0:1:38,51
drove me to be a writer.


44
0:1:38,51 --> 0:1:42,32
And by the way, I see golden
retrievers here today.


45
0:1:42,32 --> 0:1:43,9
We saw them out in the thing.


46
0:1:43,9 --> 0:1:45,57
And I brought mine,
because we were


47
0:1:45,57 --> 0:1:48,88
told we're
dog-friendly territory.


48
0:1:48,88 --> 0:1:53,26
So maybe at some point,
when people get done eating,


49
0:1:53,26 --> 0:1:55,91
I would release Anna if
nobody has a dog allergy


50
0:1:55,91 --> 0:1:57,32
and let her wander around.


51
0:1:57,32 --> 0:1:58,44
She loves people.


52
0:1:58,44 --> 0:2:1,55
So we'll wait until people
get through their food,


53
0:2:1,55 --> 0:2:4,4
because she won't be
quite so people loving,


54
0:2:4,4 --> 0:2:6,99
she'll be food
loving until then.


55
0:2:6,99 --> 0:2:9,69
I grew up in the little town
of Bedford, Pennsylvania.


56
0:2:9,69 --> 0:2:14,7
And we lived in what was
the next thing to a shack.


57
0:2:14,7 --> 0:2:16,72
It was two stories,
but it probably


58
0:2:16,72 --> 0:2:20,14
was a total of 400
or 500 square feet.


59
0:2:20,14 --> 0:2:22,61
It had a tar paper roof.


60
0:2:22,61 --> 0:2:24,195
There's a picture
of it I always keep


61
0:2:24,195 --> 0:2:26,52
to remind myself
where I came from.


62
0:2:26,52 --> 0:2:30,63
My dad had a serious
alcohol problem.


63
0:2:30,63 --> 0:2:32,42
And he was always
getting in fights.


64
0:2:32,42 --> 0:2:36,7
And by the time he
didn't work anymore,


65
0:2:36,7 --> 0:2:39,946
my wife and I counted how
many jobs we could remember he


66
0:2:39,946 --> 0:2:40,72
had had.


67
0:2:40,72 --> 0:2:43,51
And it was 44 jobs in 34 years.


68
0:2:43,51 --> 0:2:45,927
And there were periods
where he didn't work.


69
0:2:45,927 --> 0:2:47,51
And the reason there
were so many jobs


70
0:2:47,51 --> 0:2:49,57
is he also had a
tendency to violence.


71
0:2:49,57 --> 0:2:52,15
And he had a
proclivity to punch out


72
0:2:52,15 --> 0:2:54,1
the boss, which
isn't a career move,


73
0:2:54,1 --> 0:2:57,13
even at Google, where they're
so good with their employees


74
0:2:57,13 --> 0:2:59,14
that you can get away with it.


75
0:2:59,14 --> 0:3:1,14
And so there were
periods of this time


76
0:3:1,14 --> 0:3:2,6
he didn't work at all.


77
0:3:2,6 --> 0:3:4,182
He was a gambler
and a womanizer.


78
0:3:4,182 --> 0:3:5,64
We never knew
whether we were going


79
0:3:5,64 --> 0:3:8,87
to have that roof over our
heads the next day or not.


80
0:3:8,87 --> 0:3:11,95
In addition to all
that-- and I didn't


81
0:3:11,95 --> 0:3:15,94
talk about my father for a long
time after I was successful.


82
0:3:15,94 --> 0:3:17,77
And then one day
I was asked to go


83
0:3:17,77 --> 0:3:21,25
speak to a group of
Walden bookstore managers.


84
0:3:21,25 --> 0:3:25,44
Walden and Borders,
no longer with us.


85
0:3:25,44 --> 0:3:29,44
And I just did my
normal speech, telling


86
0:3:29,44 --> 0:3:30,46
stupid things that
happened to me.


87
0:3:30,46 --> 0:3:33,47
And the audience was very
with me and it was wonderful.


88
0:3:33,47 --> 0:3:36,15
And then we got to the
Q and A. And somebody


89
0:3:36,15 --> 0:3:41,67
said, how did your childhood
affect your writing career?


90
0:3:41,67 --> 0:3:45,23
Your parents must have
encouraged you to read a lot.


91
0:3:45,23 --> 0:3:49,52
And I said, oh, no, books were
not really welcome in my house.


92
0:3:49,52 --> 0:3:51,69
And books were considered
a waste of time.


93
0:3:51,69 --> 0:3:55,19
And my father was
a violent alcoholic


94
0:3:55,19 --> 0:3:58,71
who made my childhood
a kind of-- I


95
0:3:58,71 --> 0:4:0,21
had to escape into books.


96
0:4:0,21 --> 0:4:2,58
But I had to hide the
fact that I had books,


97
0:4:2,58 --> 0:4:5,39
or that I was getting
them out of the library.


98
0:4:5,39 --> 0:4:8,4
And that audience, suddenly,
I lost them entirely.


99
0:4:8,4 --> 0:4:9,234
They just went dead.


100
0:4:9,234 --> 0:4:10,941
And they were all
looking at me, like-- I


101
0:4:10,941 --> 0:4:12,33
realized, oh, I blew it.


102
0:4:12,33 --> 0:4:15,94
Now they think I've had
a terrible childhood.


103
0:4:15,94 --> 0:4:18,19
And it wasn't a
terrible childhood.


104
0:4:18,19 --> 0:4:21,795
I always felt happiness is
a choice, no matter what


105
0:4:21,795 --> 0:4:22,67
you're going through.


106
0:4:22,67 --> 0:4:24,65
And as a kid, there
were things I liked.


107
0:4:24,65 --> 0:4:25,91
One of them was books.


108
0:4:25,91 --> 0:4:29,3
And another was I got a
bike that an uncle gave me.


109
0:4:29,3 --> 0:4:33,2
And I could travel 30 miles,
40 miles a day on that bike,


110
0:4:33,2 --> 0:4:36,41
and go all over this little
farm town where I was raised.


111
0:4:36,41 --> 0:4:38,21
And I could be away
from that house.


112
0:4:38,21 --> 0:4:39,95
My mother was a great person.


113
0:4:39,95 --> 0:4:42,4
But if my father
was there, the house


114
0:4:42,4 --> 0:4:45,93
was not place anybody
would want to be.


115
0:4:45,93 --> 0:4:47,71
Then I said to
them, but you know,


116
0:4:47,71 --> 0:4:49,55
I don't mean to say
my childhood was bad.


117
0:4:49,55 --> 0:4:51,43
I told them happiness
is a choice.


118
0:4:51,43 --> 0:4:54,84
And I said also my father
had a funny side to him.


119
0:4:54,84 --> 0:4:56,62
He was a very good salesman.


120
0:4:56,62 --> 0:5:1,9
He could get people to invest
in inventions that he created.


121
0:5:1,9 --> 0:5:3,78
And he could actually
raise significant money


122
0:5:3,78 --> 0:5:7,34
for those days to
produce the invention


123
0:5:7,34 --> 0:5:10,84
in a number of copies, hundreds
of them, thousands of them,


124
0:5:10,84 --> 0:5:11,66
warehouse them.


125
0:5:11,66 --> 0:5:14,48
But they were never
anything that he could sell.


126
0:5:14,48 --> 0:5:16,15
You'll see why in just a minute.


127
0:5:16,15 --> 0:5:18,47
But he could get people
to raise the money.


128
0:5:18,47 --> 0:5:21,33
And it always amazed me,
because we never saw the money.


129
0:5:21,33 --> 0:5:23,0
He gambled it away or spent it.


130
0:5:23,0 --> 0:5:26,14
And he often had investors
trying to put him in jail.


131
0:5:26,14 --> 0:5:28,4
And he couldn't
hold onto his money.


132
0:5:28,4 --> 0:5:31,86
But he could invent things
that I thought were absurd,


133
0:5:31,86 --> 0:5:34,81
but some people thought
were good investments.


134
0:5:34,81 --> 0:5:41,53
One of the ones I remember
was he had this big exercise


135
0:5:41,53 --> 0:5:42,5
machine.


136
0:5:42,5 --> 0:5:44,54
And this was in
the days-- he may


137
0:5:44,54 --> 0:5:45,72
have been correct
about this-- he called


138
0:5:45,72 --> 0:5:48,51
it the first electric
exercise machine.


139
0:5:48,51 --> 0:5:52,71
And it may have been
true, that in those days,


140
0:5:52,71 --> 0:5:55,43
treadmills were actually
run by your own power,


141
0:5:55,43 --> 0:5:57,35
and they weren't electric.


142
0:5:57,35 --> 0:6:1,89
But it was about the size of an
old console model television.


143
0:6:1,89 --> 0:6:4,6
I'm the only one here old
enough to remember those.


144
0:6:4,6 --> 0:6:8,26
They were about this high,
and this wide, and that deep--


145
0:6:8,26 --> 0:6:9,8
a huge box.


146
0:6:9,8 --> 0:6:12,66
And this was all it
was, was this huge box.


147
0:6:12,66 --> 0:6:15,28
It had a little hole on
one side, and a hook.


148
0:6:15,28 --> 0:6:16,62
And you pulled the hook out.


149
0:6:16,62 --> 0:6:19,7
And this rope came on the hook.


150
0:6:19,7 --> 0:6:21,61
And then you were supposed
to, into a door frame,


151
0:6:21,61 --> 0:6:25,9
screw a little eye hook, so
that the hook could go into it.


152
0:6:25,9 --> 0:6:28,1
Then you turned on the
electric jump rope.


153
0:6:28,1 --> 0:6:30,74
And an engine or
motor turned it.


154
0:6:30,74 --> 0:6:32,1
And it sounded like this.


155
0:6:32,1 --> 0:6:34,28
[MOTOR NOISES]


156
0:6:34,28 --> 0:6:36,21
And it turned this jump rope.


157
0:6:36,21 --> 0:6:39,307
And I stood there
looking at this machine.


158
0:6:39,307 --> 0:6:41,39
He actually got investors
to produce 200 of these.


159
0:6:41,39 --> 0:6:43,71
He never sold any.


160
0:6:43,71 --> 0:6:48,6
And I said, but Dad, who wants
to buy an electric jump rope?


161
0:6:48,6 --> 0:6:50,57
And he got angry very quickly.


162
0:6:50,57 --> 0:6:53,51
And he said, everybody
will want to buy one.


163
0:6:53,51 --> 0:6:57,5
And I said, but when you're
exercising with the jump rope,


164
0:6:57,5 --> 0:7:1,6
part of the exercise is
the arms, the upper body.


165
0:7:1,6 --> 0:7:2,77
It's not all about the jumping.


166
0:7:2,77 --> 0:7:5,35
And he said, this is for
people who want to exercise,


167
0:7:5,35 --> 0:7:6,575
but not too damn much.


168
0:7:6,575 --> 0:7:9,14
[LAUGHTER]


169
0:7:9,14 --> 0:7:11,31
And I had no answer to that.


170
0:7:11,31 --> 0:7:14,76
And then, because he knew
that I wasn't really approving


171
0:7:14,76 --> 0:7:19,1
of this, he said, this is
also the only exercise machine


172
0:7:19,1 --> 0:7:21,19
that a blind man can use.


173
0:7:21,19 --> 0:7:24,34
And I was really
baffled at that.


174
0:7:24,34 --> 0:7:26,81
And then he pointed out to
me that every time the rope


175
0:7:26,81 --> 0:7:29,68
hit the apex if its
arc, a bell rang.


176
0:7:29,68 --> 0:7:33,12
So a blind man would know when
it was starting to come down.


177
0:7:33,12 --> 0:7:34,674
And a friend of
mine, years later


178
0:7:34,674 --> 0:7:36,9
when I was telling
him this, said,


179
0:7:36,9 --> 0:7:38,64
boy, I could see Ray
Charles in the TV commercial


180
0:7:38,64 --> 0:7:40,93
already, singing
"Ol' Man River,"


181
0:7:40,93 --> 0:7:43,48
and the jump rope coming around.


182
0:7:43,48 --> 0:7:46,11
These were always a great
horrible thing for my mother.


183
0:7:46,11 --> 0:7:50,85
Because my mother knew that when
he got people to invent things,


184
0:7:50,85 --> 0:7:55,16
or to finance his
inventions and produce them,


185
0:7:55,16 --> 0:7:56,69
that they would be
coming after us.


186
0:7:56,69 --> 0:7:58,21
And we wouldn't have the money.


187
0:7:58,21 --> 0:8:1,64
And it would just mean he
wasn't working at a job


188
0:8:1,64 --> 0:8:3,76
where he might actually succeed.


189
0:8:3,76 --> 0:8:5,5
And the only thing he
really succeeded at


190
0:8:5,5 --> 0:8:6,84
was insurance sales.


191
0:8:6,84 --> 0:8:8,35
He could sell people anything.


192
0:8:8,35 --> 0:8:10,23
But he could never
hold onto the money,


193
0:8:10,23 --> 0:8:12,12
even to bring it home for food.


194
0:8:12,12 --> 0:8:15,92
Another one of his was-- this
was maybe the most mortifying.


195
0:8:15,92 --> 0:8:18,4
He invented-- we
didn't have dogs,


196
0:8:18,4 --> 0:8:20,73
but he invented a dog bed.


197
0:8:20,73 --> 0:8:22,85
Now, it's not the dog
bed that you think of,


198
0:8:22,85 --> 0:8:26,88
which we see in any dog supply
store or pet supply store.


199
0:8:26,88 --> 0:8:30,79
My father had an elevated dog
bed that sat on a metal frame


200
0:8:30,79 --> 0:8:33,2
and was sort of almost
like a hammock, strung


201
0:8:33,2 --> 0:8:34,39
kind of tightly.


202
0:8:34,39 --> 0:8:37,78
And I said, well,
why do dogs want


203
0:8:37,78 --> 0:8:39,773
to climb up on something
like that to sleep?


204
0:8:39,773 --> 0:8:41,814
If they want to climb up,
they'll sleep on a sofa


205
0:8:41,814 --> 0:8:43,49
or they'll sleep on the floor.


206
0:8:43,49 --> 0:8:46,16
And he said, no dogs
don't want to be


207
0:8:46,16 --> 0:8:48,25
down there where
the bugs might be.


208
0:8:48,25 --> 0:8:51,98
And I didn't no dogs
had a thing about bugs.


209
0:8:51,98 --> 0:8:56,25
And he said, also, this is the
only dog bed that's heated.


210
0:8:56,25 --> 0:8:59,79
And I thought,
well, dogs have fur.


211
0:8:59,79 --> 0:9:2,44
And I know some
small breeds, maybe,


212
0:9:2,44 --> 0:9:5,14
need to be warm, because
they don't have thick coats.


213
0:9:5,14 --> 0:9:7,85
But I said, well,
how are you going


214
0:9:7,85 --> 0:9:9,235
to get a dog to sleep on this?


215
0:9:9,235 --> 0:9:11,11
I don't think a dog's
going to sleep on this.


216
0:9:11,11 --> 0:9:14,95
And he said, we're making these,
and we're going to sell them.


217
0:9:14,95 --> 0:9:15,839
And they made them.


218
0:9:15,839 --> 0:9:17,63
They always made them
before they found out


219
0:9:17,63 --> 0:9:19,3
if there was a market.


220
0:9:19,3 --> 0:9:22,33
And he found out he couldn't
sell these everywhere


221
0:9:22,33 --> 0:9:24,9
where you would sell dog things.


222
0:9:24,9 --> 0:9:28,36
So then he knew a man who had a
series of 14 service stations.


223
0:9:28,36 --> 0:9:32,16
So my father decided that
these would be a perfect object


224
0:9:32,16 --> 0:9:34,16
to sell out of a
service station.


225
0:9:34,16 --> 0:9:36,1
When you go to a service
station to get gas,


226
0:9:36,1 --> 0:9:37,51
and you see this
dog bed, and you've


227
0:9:37,51 --> 0:9:41,15
got dogs, well, of
course you'll buy one.


228
0:9:41,15 --> 0:9:45,31
Google would be nowhere with
my dad as your marketing guy.


229
0:9:45,31 --> 0:9:49,45
So he had all these, but
he couldn't sell them.


230
0:9:49,45 --> 0:9:50,82
But he decided on this.


231
0:9:50,82 --> 0:9:53,73
And he talked to this guy who
had all these service stations.


232
0:9:53,73 --> 0:9:58,83
And this guy decided
he'd look at it.


233
0:9:58,83 --> 0:10:2,81
And so my father set
up a demonstration.


234
0:10:2,81 --> 0:10:4,33
This was after my
mother had died.


235
0:10:4,33 --> 0:10:7,32
And my father had a
string of girlfriends.


236
0:10:7,32 --> 0:10:10,5
And the girlfriend
had this little dog.


237
0:10:10,5 --> 0:10:11,28
It was a mutt.


238
0:10:11,28 --> 0:10:12,51
But it was cute.


239
0:10:12,51 --> 0:10:15,1
And dog's name is Fluffy.


240
0:10:15,1 --> 0:10:17,14
And my father--
oh, I almost forgot


241
0:10:17,14 --> 0:10:19,59
one of the most
interesting things.


242
0:10:19,59 --> 0:10:21,6
My father had
pamphlets printed up.


243
0:10:21,6 --> 0:10:23,77
And the name was
also on the thing.


244
0:10:23,77 --> 0:10:26,19
And it was called
the Koontz Komfy Kot.


245
0:10:26,19 --> 0:10:27,88
And my father thought
it would be clever


246
0:10:27,88 --> 0:10:29,76
if it was spelled KKK.


247
0:10:29,76 --> 0:10:32,55
[LAUGHTER]


248
0:10:32,55 --> 0:10:34,83
It never occurred to
him that he alienated


249
0:10:34,83 --> 0:10:37,96
98% of the people
who saw the bed.


250
0:10:37,96 --> 0:10:40,67
And so the pamphlets
had Koontz Komfy Kot,


251
0:10:40,67 --> 0:10:42,87
and the K were bigger
than anything else,


252
0:10:42,87 --> 0:10:45,5
so you read it as KKK.


253
0:10:45,5 --> 0:10:47,58
And Fluffy was there, and
the girlfriend was there,


254
0:10:47,58 --> 0:10:50,8
and my father was
there, and I was there.


255
0:10:50,8 --> 0:10:54,21
And they couldn't get Fluffy--
encouraging Fluffy to get up


256
0:10:54,21 --> 0:10:56,32
on the bed, they
couldn't encourage him.


257
0:10:56,32 --> 0:10:57,74
Fluffy wanted nothing
to do with the bed,


258
0:10:57,74 --> 0:10:59,55
like I sort of suspected.


259
0:10:59,55 --> 0:11:1,59
So my father grabbed
hold of Fluffy,


260
0:11:1,59 --> 0:11:3,84
who was a nervous little
dog to begin with.


261
0:11:3,84 --> 0:11:5,87
And in front of this
guy he's demonstrating


262
0:11:5,87 --> 0:11:9,93
it to, picked Fluffy
up, set him on the bed.


263
0:11:9,93 --> 0:11:12,3
And Fluffy did what
nervous dogs tend to do.


264
0:11:12,3 --> 0:11:14,58
He urinated.


265
0:11:14,58 --> 0:11:17,63
And that's when they found
out the heating pad was not


266
0:11:17,63 --> 0:11:20,1
waterproof.


267
0:11:20,1 --> 0:11:23,72
It was like a Road
Runner cartoon.


268
0:11:23,72 --> 0:11:25,9
Fluffy just wanted
right off the thing.


269
0:11:25,9 --> 0:11:28,52
He wasn't electrocuted.


270
0:11:28,52 --> 0:11:31,4
But he was a very
suspicious dog thereafter.


271
0:11:31,4 --> 0:11:33,88
[LAUGHTER]


272
0:11:33,88 --> 0:11:36,2
And of course, once
that was revealed,


273
0:11:36,2 --> 0:11:38,12
the fella with 17
service stations


274
0:11:38,12 --> 0:11:40,13
didn't want to sell
it there either.


275
0:11:40,13 --> 0:11:43,45
So then my father
didn't only invent,


276
0:11:43,45 --> 0:11:46,79
he also sometimes
got business ideas.


277
0:11:46,79 --> 0:11:48,824
And one of them
that he got was-- he


278
0:11:48,824 --> 0:11:50,24
thought it would
be a great idea--


279
0:11:50,24 --> 0:11:52,96
he bought a used
steam cleaning rig.


280
0:11:52,96 --> 0:11:56,61



281
0:11:56,61 --> 0:11:59,14
It was all on wheels, and
it was pretty unwieldy.


282
0:11:59,14 --> 0:12:2,15
And it was a thing that
generated steam and was


283
0:12:2,15 --> 0:12:3,22
gasoline powered.


284
0:12:3,22 --> 0:12:6,22
And then you had the steam
wand, which sent the steam out


285
0:12:6,22 --> 0:12:7,54
under high pressure.


286
0:12:7,54 --> 0:12:11,39
And he was going to start a
company to pressure wash truck


287
0:12:11,39 --> 0:12:12,46
engines.


288
0:12:12,46 --> 0:12:15,575
We lived in a town that had a
number of depots for roadway


289
0:12:15,575 --> 0:12:16,91
and a number of trucks.


290
0:12:16,91 --> 0:12:19,62
So they had a lot of trucks
there at any one time.


291
0:12:19,62 --> 0:12:21,54
Why they wouldn't
necessarily feel


292
0:12:21,54 --> 0:12:24,13
it was advantageous to them
to have their truck engines


293
0:12:24,13 --> 0:12:27,18
steam cleaned on a regular
basis, I have no idea.


294
0:12:27,18 --> 0:12:28,91
And as it turned
out, they really


295
0:12:28,91 --> 0:12:31,72
didn't find that
very interesting.


296
0:12:31,72 --> 0:12:34,36
But he thought that was
going to be a big deal.


297
0:12:34,36 --> 0:12:35,63
And it was over the summer.


298
0:12:35,63 --> 0:12:40,66
And so I used to work at summers
when I was in high school.


299
0:12:40,66 --> 0:12:42,42
But that summer, I
was not permitted


300
0:12:42,42 --> 0:12:45,6
to go back to the supermarket
where I worked other summers.


301
0:12:45,6 --> 0:12:47,91
And I was to work with him.


302
0:12:47,91 --> 0:12:51,71
And because he was the boss,
he got the prestige job


303
0:12:51,71 --> 0:12:53,31
with the steam wand.


304
0:12:53,31 --> 0:12:56,37
And my job was to do
whatever he told me to do.


305
0:12:56,37 --> 0:12:58,43
But there was one thing
that had to be done


306
0:12:58,43 --> 0:13:0,47
and was really essential.


307
0:13:0,47 --> 0:13:5,72
And that was the release valve,
pressure valve on this thing.


308
0:13:5,72 --> 0:13:9,64
When the pressure built up
so far that it was dangerous,


309
0:13:9,64 --> 0:13:10,92
it was supposed to release.


310
0:13:10,92 --> 0:13:12,47
There was a pressure
release valve.


311
0:13:12,47 --> 0:13:16,8
Except it sometimes-- in fact,
a lot of times-- would stick.


312
0:13:16,8 --> 0:13:20,25
And what I was supposed to do
was when it stuck and started


313
0:13:20,25 --> 0:13:22,23
to whistle, I was
supposed to take a hammer


314
0:13:22,23 --> 0:13:24,92
and go up to the
generator and smash it


315
0:13:24,92 --> 0:13:28,5
at the side of the thing
until it popped loose.


316
0:13:28,5 --> 0:13:31,14
I thought I was going
to die that summer.


317
0:13:31,14 --> 0:13:34,5
But I'd go up and hammer
it, and it would pop loose.


318
0:13:34,5 --> 0:13:37,0
And the truck thing
didn't last very long.


319
0:13:37,0 --> 0:13:40,56
And nobody seemed to want it,
except the car crazy people


320
0:13:40,56 --> 0:13:42,86
wanted their car engine
to look really clean.


321
0:13:42,86 --> 0:13:44,67
But it wasn't enough
to make a business at.


322
0:13:44,67 --> 0:13:46,99
So then he got the
idea that supermarkets


323
0:13:46,99 --> 0:13:49,82
would like to have their carts
cleaned, because they care


324
0:13:49,82 --> 0:13:53,33
so much about you may be
touching germs on your cart.


325
0:13:53,33 --> 0:13:56,36
Well, he did get one supermarket
to clean a couple hundred.


326
0:13:56,36 --> 0:13:58,318
But after they looked at
them and they couldn't


327
0:13:58,318 --> 0:14:0,65
see that much difference,
that was the end of that.


328
0:14:0,65 --> 0:14:4,99
So the big deal he came
up with was cemetery.


329
0:14:4,99 --> 0:14:7,78
It was his idea
to go in and sell


330
0:14:7,78 --> 0:14:11,19
through the cemetery
people a deal.


331
0:14:11,19 --> 0:14:13,55
If you have a
relative buried here,


332
0:14:13,55 --> 0:14:16,925
we will come in once a month
and clean your tombstone


333
0:14:16,925 --> 0:14:21,16
of your relatives, and it
will always looks pristine.


334
0:14:21,16 --> 0:14:25,105
Because, you know, motors
throw grass up on the stone,


335
0:14:25,105 --> 0:14:27,53
and birds do their
thing, and there's dust.


336
0:14:27,53 --> 0:14:29,79
And so we would
steam clean these.


337
0:14:29,79 --> 0:14:31,796
So he did set up
another demonstration


338
0:14:31,796 --> 0:14:33,295
for the people who
ran the cemetery.


339
0:14:33,295 --> 0:14:36,2
And there were two men and
a woman there for this.


340
0:14:36,2 --> 0:14:39,9
And he set up a stone.


341
0:14:39,9 --> 0:14:41,25
And this was back in the
days when we were first


342
0:14:41,25 --> 0:14:43,22
beginning to see these--
the medallions that


343
0:14:43,22 --> 0:14:46,1
would have a picture of
the dead person on it.


344
0:14:46,1 --> 0:14:47,94
And that was sort
of a new thing.


345
0:14:47,94 --> 0:14:49,88
And it was sort of inset.


346
0:14:49,88 --> 0:14:51,96
And it was glued, of
course, [INAUDIBLE].


347
0:14:51,96 --> 0:14:53,61
And he chose to
clean one of these.


348
0:14:53,61 --> 0:14:57,19
And when he took the
steam wand across the disk


349
0:14:57,19 --> 0:14:59,43
with the picture on
it, it popped loose


350
0:14:59,43 --> 0:15:3,49
and flew like a martial
arts killing star.


351
0:15:3,49 --> 0:15:5,4
And everyone went, ah!


352
0:15:5,4 --> 0:15:9,84
And it goes across the cemetery
and smashes into another stone.


353
0:15:9,84 --> 0:15:11,0
And as that thing is
tearing loose and flying,


354
0:15:11,0 --> 0:15:12,28
my father goes, whoa!


355
0:15:12,28 --> 0:15:14,189
And he pulls the
wand up like this.


356
0:15:14,189 --> 0:15:15,48
And there's a tree overhanging.


357
0:15:15,48 --> 0:15:18,46
And he blows leaves
off the tree.


358
0:15:18,46 --> 0:15:19,3
It's summer.


359
0:15:19,3 --> 0:15:20,51
He kills the tree.


360
0:15:20,51 --> 0:15:22,3
The leaves are
blown off the tree.


361
0:15:22,3 --> 0:15:24,54
And birds come exploding
out of the tree.


362
0:15:24,54 --> 0:15:27,72
And the demonstration's going
very badly, at this point.


363
0:15:27,72 --> 0:15:29,74
Even he knows this.


364
0:15:29,74 --> 0:15:36,82
And at that moment,
the valve sticks.


365
0:15:36,82 --> 0:15:38,81
And I grab up the hammer.


366
0:15:38,81 --> 0:15:41,21
And I go over and
start hammering on it.


367
0:15:41,21 --> 0:15:44,33
And this is the one time
that the hammering on it


368
0:15:44,33 --> 0:15:45,2
isn't working.


369
0:15:45,2 --> 0:15:47,23
And my father has
always told me,


370
0:15:47,23 --> 0:15:52,64
if it doesn't come lose in
so many times you hit it,


371
0:15:52,64 --> 0:15:53,87
then just run.


372
0:15:53,87 --> 0:15:56,98
[LAUGHTER]


373
0:15:56,98 --> 0:15:59,68
So I'm hitting it
and hitting it.


374
0:15:59,68 --> 0:16:2,35
And it's not coming loose.


375
0:16:2,35 --> 0:16:6,13
And so I not only
run, I yell, run!


376
0:16:6,13 --> 0:16:7,27
And I turn and run.


377
0:16:7,27 --> 0:16:9,54
And now these people, these
two men and this woman


378
0:16:9,54 --> 0:16:12,78
with the cemetery,
they start running.


379
0:16:12,78 --> 0:16:15,18
And we're all running
away from the generator.


380
0:16:15,18 --> 0:16:18,1
And the woman falls,
trips and falls.


381
0:16:18,1 --> 0:16:19,72
And I'm a polite young man.


382
0:16:19,72 --> 0:16:22,95
And I stoop over
to to help her up.


383
0:16:22,95 --> 0:16:25,23
And I-- let me help you up.


384
0:16:25,23 --> 0:16:26,8
And I take her by her arm.


385
0:16:26,8 --> 0:16:27,94
And she looks around at me.


386
0:16:27,94 --> 0:16:29,54
And I've got the
hammer like this.


387
0:16:29,54 --> 0:16:32,25
And she goes, no!


388
0:16:32,25 --> 0:16:33,29
We didn't get that.


389
0:16:33,29 --> 0:16:36,43
And that was the end of
the pressure washing event.


390
0:16:36,43 --> 0:16:39,66
So somehow I survived
that childhood.


391
0:16:39,66 --> 0:16:42,77
And there were many nights
where-- we had one car.


392
0:16:42,77 --> 0:16:43,58
Not much of a car.


393
0:16:43,58 --> 0:16:46,36
But we'd be called at a
quarter to 2:00 in the morning,


394
0:16:46,36 --> 0:16:47,7
because bars closed at two.


395
0:16:47,7 --> 0:16:49,944
But we'd have to
walk to the bar,


396
0:16:49,944 --> 0:16:51,36
because he was
drunk on the floor.


397
0:16:51,36 --> 0:16:53,91
And there were all those
humiliating things.


398
0:16:53,91 --> 0:16:57,97
And so I always felt
like an outcast as a kid,


399
0:16:57,97 --> 0:17:0,14
and pretty much was.


400
0:17:0,14 --> 0:17:2,94
I said, my father
wasn't the town drunk.


401
0:17:2,94 --> 0:17:7,42
But he was one of them,
and widely known for that.


402
0:17:7,42 --> 0:17:9,31
So books saved me.


403
0:17:9,31 --> 0:17:11,65
It was books that
I could escape,


404
0:17:11,65 --> 0:17:17,349
and I would know that
people live different ways.


405
0:17:17,349 --> 0:17:19,76
And it's kind of funny
when you're a kid,


406
0:17:19,76 --> 0:17:21,794
and you're living in
that kind of environment.


407
0:17:21,794 --> 0:17:23,46
And you can come to
think that everybody


408
0:17:23,46 --> 0:17:26,43
lives this way when
the doors closed.


409
0:17:26,43 --> 0:17:28,21
And so books showed
me that that wasn't


410
0:17:28,21 --> 0:17:30,66
the case, that there were
other ways to live lives.


411
0:17:30,66 --> 0:17:32,85
It also helped me to escape.


412
0:17:32,85 --> 0:17:34,434
My mother was the
sweetest person.


413
0:17:34,434 --> 0:17:36,85
And I don't know why she put
up with this all those years.


414
0:17:36,85 --> 0:17:39,38
But she also was not
much about books.


415
0:17:39,38 --> 0:17:43,6
And she used to say to me, books
are a total waste, especially


416
0:17:43,6 --> 0:17:45,2
as I got to be 13, 14.


417
0:17:45,2 --> 0:17:48,21
And I said, well they're
not a waste of time to me.


418
0:17:48,21 --> 0:17:50,86
She said you could be
spending that time learning


419
0:17:50,86 --> 0:17:52,47
to fix your car.


420
0:17:52,47 --> 0:17:53,13
Well, I didn't have a car.


421
0:17:53,13 --> 0:17:56,46
And she said, one day
you're going to have a car.


422
0:17:56,46 --> 0:17:58,23
And nobody in our
family is ever going


423
0:17:58,23 --> 0:18:0,18
to be able to afford a mechanic.


424
0:18:0,18 --> 0:18:2,72
So you better learn
to repair your car.


425
0:18:2,72 --> 0:18:4,22
And I said well,
then I'm just going


426
0:18:4,22 --> 0:18:6,15
to have to be the
first one in the family


427
0:18:6,15 --> 0:18:8,32
ever to afford a mechanic.


428
0:18:8,32 --> 0:18:10,37
The irony of me is
it was books that


429
0:18:10,37 --> 0:18:15,9
helped me afford a mechanic,
and a pretty good car, too.


430
0:18:15,9 --> 0:18:18,1
So I was a happy to
get out of that house.


431
0:18:18,1 --> 0:18:22,33
And I worked my way
through a teachers college


432
0:18:22,33 --> 0:18:25,98
and taught in the poverty
program for a year


433
0:18:25,98 --> 0:18:27,96
when Lyndon Johnson
was president.


434
0:18:27,96 --> 0:18:31,8
And that was an eye-opening
experience for me.


435
0:18:31,8 --> 0:18:35,63
I was in a program
where the teachers


436
0:18:35,63 --> 0:18:41,82
were supposed to pick students
in their class that were highly


437
0:18:41,82 --> 0:18:46,25
intelligent, had lots
of potential and desire,


438
0:18:46,25 --> 0:18:49,26
but who came from
extremely poor families


439
0:18:49,26 --> 0:18:52,92
and would benefit, therefore,
from having almost a tutor


440
0:18:52,92 --> 0:18:54,51
program for the day.


441
0:18:54,51 --> 0:18:57,76
So teachers were supposed
to pick 16 children out


442
0:18:57,76 --> 0:18:59,32
of all their classes.


443
0:18:59,32 --> 0:19:2,97
They were to come to me for
English in small groups.


444
0:19:2,97 --> 0:19:6,78
And I got this job because I
hurried my way through college.


445
0:19:6,78 --> 0:19:8,46
I wanted to get
married to Gerda,


446
0:19:8,46 --> 0:19:10,97
and so I took extra
classes and got through


447
0:19:10,97 --> 0:19:12,86
in three and a half years.


448
0:19:12,86 --> 0:19:16,12
And I was graduating
and going into this job


449
0:19:16,12 --> 0:19:18,91
in a school district
in late October.


450
0:19:18,91 --> 0:19:21,3
And it never occurred
to me to think, well,


451
0:19:21,3 --> 0:19:23,74
wasn't this job filled at
the beginning of September?


452
0:19:23,74 --> 0:19:24,75
Yes, it was.


453
0:19:24,75 --> 0:19:26,31
But the fellow who
had the job, which


454
0:19:26,31 --> 0:19:29,58
I didn't learn until the
day I showed up for work,


455
0:19:29,58 --> 0:19:31,67
had been run off
the road by students


456
0:19:31,67 --> 0:19:34,77
and beaten up so badly he was
in the hospital for six weeks,


457
0:19:34,77 --> 0:19:37,77
and decided he didn't
want to come back to work.


458
0:19:37,77 --> 0:19:39,4
So they filled the job with me.


459
0:19:39,4 --> 0:19:40,74
And I thought, well, that's odd.


460
0:19:40,74 --> 0:19:43,63



461
0:19:43,63 --> 0:19:45,6
It's just teaching English.


462
0:19:45,6 --> 0:19:46,63
It's not like he
was-- you know, I


463
0:19:46,63 --> 0:19:48,81
might have wanted to do
that to my phys ed teacher,


464
0:19:48,81 --> 0:19:50,6
but never to my English teacher.


465
0:19:50,6 --> 0:19:54,1
And so then I discovered
that what happened


466
0:19:54,1 --> 0:19:56,93
was the teachers
took this differently


467
0:19:56,93 --> 0:19:58,54
than the program intended.


468
0:19:58,54 --> 0:20:0,69
What they wanted to
do was not yet rid


469
0:20:0,69 --> 0:20:2,33
of their most
intelligent students,


470
0:20:2,33 --> 0:20:4,42
but their most
troublesome students.


471
0:20:4,42 --> 0:20:7,27
So they got rid of the ones
who'd been in reform school


472
0:20:7,27 --> 0:20:9,83
or had police
records or whatever.


473
0:20:9,83 --> 0:20:12,5
So that was a very
interesting year.


474
0:20:12,5 --> 0:20:15,68
And at that, I said, you know,
I don't want to do this either.


475
0:20:15,68 --> 0:20:17,47
And I managed to
get through the year


476
0:20:17,47 --> 0:20:20,41
without getting beaten
up and put in a hospital.


477
0:20:20,41 --> 0:20:22,56
But it was only
because I realized


478
0:20:22,56 --> 0:20:24,65
that these kids had
huge amounts of energy.


479
0:20:24,65 --> 0:20:28,59
So we would do things like I'd
bring a rubber ball to school.


480
0:20:28,59 --> 0:20:31,5
Not a hard one, but not
a super soft one, either.


481
0:20:31,5 --> 0:20:33,54
These days, I'd probably
be put in jail for this.


482
0:20:33,54 --> 0:20:37,58
But when we were
talking doing lessons,


483
0:20:37,58 --> 0:20:39,82
I had the license to
ask you a question.


484
0:20:39,82 --> 0:20:42,3
If you couldn't answer it, I
could throw the ball at you.


485
0:20:42,3 --> 0:20:46,3
And if I missed, you could throw
it at me anytime you wanted.


486
0:20:46,3 --> 0:20:48,81
You could keep it for
a half hour and do it.


487
0:20:48,81 --> 0:20:51,35
So we did things like
this to keep it energetic.


488
0:20:51,35 --> 0:20:54,63
And by the time they were
done at the end of the day,


489
0:20:54,63 --> 0:20:57,916
they didn't want to
bother beating me up.


490
0:20:57,916 --> 0:20:59,29
And then I taught
regular school.


491
0:20:59,29 --> 0:21:1,71
And then my wife said, I
know you want to write.


492
0:21:1,71 --> 0:21:4,44
I was selling short stories in
a couple of paperback novels.


493
0:21:4,44 --> 0:21:10,7
And she said, I know you
want to write novels,


494
0:21:10,7 --> 0:21:14,39
so I'll support you for five
years while you try to do that.


495
0:21:14,39 --> 0:21:17,46
She was working at a credit
bureau in those days.


496
0:21:17,46 --> 0:21:20,97
And so I took her up on it.


497
0:21:20,97 --> 0:21:23,56
I tried to bargain
her up to seven years.


498
0:21:23,56 --> 0:21:26,39
But she's got Sicilian
blood, so she always


499
0:21:26,39 --> 0:21:27,85
wins those arguments.


500
0:21:27,85 --> 0:21:30,83
And it took four
and a half years


501
0:21:30,83 --> 0:21:32,52
before she was able
to quit her job


502
0:21:32,52 --> 0:21:36,0
and go to work running
the business side of mine.


503
0:21:36,0 --> 0:21:38,3
And we've now been
married 47 years.


504
0:21:38,3 --> 0:21:42,65
And it's been the greatest
relationship of my life.


505
0:21:42,65 --> 0:21:47,2
But that's how I
got into writing.


506
0:21:47,2 --> 0:21:50,65
And I wrote paperbacks, a
lot of things over the years.


507
0:21:50,65 --> 0:21:52,44
And finally I got
to the point where


508
0:21:52,44 --> 0:21:54,34
books started to
actually sell, which


509
0:21:54,34 --> 0:21:55,55
was a whole new idea for me.


510
0:21:55,55 --> 0:21:58,2
I mean, I'd sell them,
but very few people


511
0:21:58,2 --> 0:21:59,54
would buy them for many years.


512
0:21:59,54 --> 0:22:1,977
And royalties were not great.


513
0:22:1,977 --> 0:22:3,6
But we could live on them.


514
0:22:3,6 --> 0:22:5,65
And then suddenly one day,
things started to change.


515
0:22:5,65 --> 0:22:8,26
And people started
to find the books.


516
0:22:8,26 --> 0:22:12,7
And I had a publisher then
who didn't, let's just say,


517
0:22:12,7 --> 0:22:13,99
have a lot of faith in me.


518
0:22:13,99 --> 0:22:16,31
But when the books started
to work a little bit,


519
0:22:16,31 --> 0:22:17,86
then she said, I wonder.


520
0:22:17,86 --> 0:22:20,51
And I had this book
called "Strangers."


521
0:22:20,51 --> 0:22:23,26
and it was a big book
with 12 leading characters


522
0:22:23,26 --> 0:22:25,6
and lots of different stories.


523
0:22:25,6 --> 0:22:27,56
And it all has to do
with these characters


524
0:22:27,56 --> 0:22:30,31
all experience something
in the same place


525
0:22:30,31 --> 0:22:32,81
at the same time a
few years before.


526
0:22:32,81 --> 0:22:35,33
And they've all been
brainwashed to forget it.


527
0:22:35,33 --> 0:22:37,53
But the brainwashing
isn't holding.


528
0:22:37,53 --> 0:22:40,489
And different things are
happening to all of them.


529
0:22:40,489 --> 0:22:42,78
And they don't understand
why these things [INAUDIBLE].


530
0:22:42,78 --> 0:22:44,185
Some are having nightmares.


531
0:22:44,185 --> 0:22:46,99
Some are having
moments of fugue.


532
0:22:46,99 --> 0:22:49,739
Others are having all kinds
of different problems.


533
0:22:49,739 --> 0:22:51,78
And gradually they find
their ways to each other.


534
0:22:51,78 --> 0:22:53,4
But in the beginning
of the book,


535
0:22:53,4 --> 0:22:55,3
there is the one
lead character who


536
0:22:55,3 --> 0:22:57,91
keeps waking up from
nightmares and finds


537
0:22:57,91 --> 0:22:59,5
he's been sleepwalking.


538
0:22:59,5 --> 0:23:1,5
And he wakes up at
the back of closets.


539
0:23:1,5 --> 0:23:3,1
He wakes up in
different places where


540
0:23:3,1 --> 0:23:4,99
it's clear he's
hiding from something.


541
0:23:4,99 --> 0:23:6,85
But he can never
remember the dreams.


542
0:23:6,85 --> 0:23:9,83
And he doesn't know
what he was hiding from.


543
0:23:9,83 --> 0:23:13,52
In the first part of the book,
he wakes up at one point.


544
0:23:13,52 --> 0:23:16,15
He mentions that he wakes
up behind the furnace


545
0:23:16,15 --> 0:23:17,8
in the garage.


546
0:23:17,8 --> 0:23:20,4
And it so happened
when I delivered


547
0:23:20,4 --> 0:23:23,52
"Strangers," my
publisher said, I


548
0:23:23,52 --> 0:23:26,65
think you should not
have a commercial editor.


549
0:23:26,65 --> 0:23:29,11
I think you should
have a literary editor.


550
0:23:29,11 --> 0:23:31,15
And I'm going to give
you a literary editor.


551
0:23:31,15 --> 0:23:32,816
And I though, this
is going to be great.


552
0:23:32,816 --> 0:23:34,89
It's like Thomas Wolfe
and Ernest Hemingway.


553
0:23:34,89 --> 0:23:37,19
I wonder what a literary
editor would be like.


554
0:23:37,19 --> 0:23:38,78
This is going to be fun.


555
0:23:38,78 --> 0:23:41,65
And so I really
liked this fella.


556
0:23:41,65 --> 0:23:42,65
He was a great guy.


557
0:23:42,65 --> 0:23:43,64
His name was Alan.


558
0:23:43,64 --> 0:23:45,11
And I delivered this book.


559
0:23:45,11 --> 0:23:48,4
And it was 940 manuscript pages.


560
0:23:48,4 --> 0:23:52,3
And my publisher came back,
said, I love this book.


561
0:23:52,3 --> 0:23:54,32
But you're going to
have to cut in half.


562
0:23:54,32 --> 0:23:55,93
It's too big.


563
0:23:55,93 --> 0:23:58,82
And I could see no
way to cut in half.


564
0:23:58,82 --> 0:24:0,61
If any of you've
read my stuff, I


565
0:24:0,61 --> 0:24:3,43
tend to write pretty
tightly structured books.


566
0:24:3,43 --> 0:24:5,24
And I said, I don't
see how I can do that.


567
0:24:5,24 --> 0:24:9,4
And she said, Alan is going
to show you how to do this.


568
0:24:9,4 --> 0:24:11,27
So I thought, well, this
is going to be amazing,


569
0:24:11,27 --> 0:24:14,3
because I don't think
it's possible to cut 400.


570
0:24:14,3 --> 0:24:16,482
She said, just cut 430 pages.


571
0:24:16,482 --> 0:24:17,69
You don't have to go halfway.


572
0:24:17,69 --> 0:24:20,83



573
0:24:20,83 --> 0:24:23,51
So Alan said, I'm
going through it.


574
0:24:23,51 --> 0:24:24,9
I've read it.


575
0:24:24,9 --> 0:24:24,69
I love it.


576
0:24:24,69 --> 0:24:27,74
But I can show you how
to cut it and everything.


577
0:24:27,74 --> 0:24:31,66
And he said that the way
it's probably going to happen


578
0:24:31,66 --> 0:24:33,61
is, you've got 12
lead characters,


579
0:24:33,61 --> 0:24:35,7
and we'll just cut
them down to nine.


580
0:24:35,7 --> 0:24:39,21
And I thought, yeah, but all the
stories kind of move like this.


581
0:24:39,21 --> 0:24:41,29
And what happens if
he pulled this thread?


582
0:24:41,29 --> 0:24:43,424
Isn't this going to
unravel over here?


583
0:24:43,424 --> 0:24:44,34
He's going to show me.


584
0:24:44,34 --> 0:24:46,245
He's a famous literary editor.


585
0:24:46,245 --> 0:24:50,392
So OK, I'll bite my tongue and
we'll see what happens here.


586
0:24:50,392 --> 0:24:51,85
But then he said,
you know, there's


587
0:24:51,85 --> 0:24:54,38
something that really
bothers me in this book.


588
0:24:54,38 --> 0:24:59,15
You know that moment early on
when the lead character wakes


589
0:24:59,15 --> 0:25:0,57
up behind the furnace?


590
0:25:0,57 --> 0:25:1,31
And I said, yes.


591
0:25:1,31 --> 0:25:4,9
He said, the furnace
is in the garage.


592
0:25:4,9 --> 0:25:6,56
What would the furnace
be doing in the garage?


593
0:25:6,56 --> 0:25:10,24
And I said this is Southern
California where where he's


594
0:25:10,24 --> 0:25:14,184
living, and most furnaces
are in the garage.


595
0:25:14,184 --> 0:25:15,1
Some are in the attic.


596
0:25:15,1 --> 0:25:16,474
But they're mostly
in the garage.


597
0:25:16,474 --> 0:25:18,6
Well, why aren't
they in the basement?


598
0:25:18,6 --> 0:25:20,1
I said, see, in
Southern California,


599
0:25:20,1 --> 0:25:22,31
very, very few houses
have a basement.


600
0:25:22,31 --> 0:25:25,14
They're built on
slabs of concrete.


601
0:25:25,14 --> 0:25:28,34
Oh, still, people, when
they're reading it,


602
0:25:28,34 --> 0:25:30,47
who don't know that,
are going to say,


603
0:25:30,47 --> 0:25:34,48
what's the furnace
doing in the garage?


604
0:25:34,48 --> 0:25:37,2
And they're going to lose
track of the story right away.


605
0:25:37,2 --> 0:25:40,665
And I said, I don't think so.


606
0:25:40,665 --> 0:25:43,22
If the story isn't
gripping enough


607
0:25:43,22 --> 0:25:45,6
to get past the furnace--


608
0:25:45,6 --> 0:25:47,207
And he says, well, I don't know.


609
0:25:47,207 --> 0:25:48,79
I'm going to have
to think about this.


610
0:25:48,79 --> 0:25:50,64
But he said,
meanwhile, I'm going


611
0:25:50,64 --> 0:25:52,92
to show you how to
cut these pages.


612
0:25:52,92 --> 0:25:55,15
Which I said, OK, we'll
see how this goes.


613
0:25:55,15 --> 0:25:58,9
So about six weeks go by.


614
0:25:58,9 --> 0:26:0,7
And the manuscript lands for me.


615
0:26:0,7 --> 0:26:2,14
And it comes with a letter.


616
0:26:2,14 --> 0:26:6,8
And the letter said, Dear Dean,
I have redlined some things


617
0:26:6,8 --> 0:26:8,65
I think we can cut.


618
0:26:8,65 --> 0:26:12,23
And you'll see that
I have redlined


619
0:26:12,23 --> 0:26:14,7
10 pages worth of cuts.


620
0:26:14,7 --> 0:26:18,7
Now all you need to do
is find the rest of them.


621
0:26:18,7 --> 0:26:20,83
He was joking a
little bit, because he


622
0:26:20,83 --> 0:26:24,4
was trying to tell me,
without dissing the publisher,


623
0:26:24,4 --> 0:26:27,1
that this wasn't
going to be possible.


624
0:26:27,1 --> 0:26:31,76
But then it was around that time
that my publisher learned this.


625
0:26:31,76 --> 0:26:36,95
She said, OK, I guess Alan
knows what he's talking about.


626
0:26:36,95 --> 0:26:39,8
But if you ever
write a book again


627
0:26:39,8 --> 0:26:41,3
like this with all
these characters,


628
0:26:41,3 --> 0:26:43,6
please write it so
that some of them


629
0:26:43,6 --> 0:26:46,88
can be pulled out without
hurting the story.


630
0:26:46,88 --> 0:26:48,6
And I tried to
imagine doing that.


631
0:26:48,6 --> 0:26:50,89
Yeah, I'm going to spend
an extra three or four


632
0:26:50,89 --> 0:26:52,88
months on the book,
writing all this stuff in,


633
0:26:52,88 --> 0:26:54,49
so they can pull
it out and it won't


634
0:26:54,49 --> 0:26:56,4
affect the rest of the book.


635
0:26:56,4 --> 0:26:58,69
But I didn't say anything.


636
0:26:58,69 --> 0:27:3,72
So Alan also when he called
me to say he knew I had it


637
0:27:3,72 --> 0:27:7,7
and he called me and said, yeah,
find how many pages you can.


638
0:27:7,7 --> 0:27:10,66
But you're never going
to find what is wanted.


639
0:27:10,66 --> 0:27:14,1
Just do the best you can
and see what I've done.


640
0:27:14,1 --> 0:27:14,99
I said, OK.


641
0:27:14,99 --> 0:27:18,13
He said, but I'm still
really upset that furnace


642
0:27:18,13 --> 0:27:19,175
in the garage.


643
0:27:19,175 --> 0:27:21,73
And you know, I just
realized, there's


644
0:27:21,73 --> 0:27:24,57
another moment where there's
a furnace in a garage later


645
0:27:24,57 --> 0:27:25,8
in the novel.


646
0:27:25,8 --> 0:27:28,69
And I said, well, Alan, I
can't do anything about it.


647
0:27:28,69 --> 0:27:30,53
Because it is
Southern California.


648
0:27:30,53 --> 0:27:33,36
And that's the way it
is here in California.


649
0:27:33,36 --> 0:27:34,311
And a few days go by.


650
0:27:34,311 --> 0:27:35,56
And I'm working on the script.


651
0:27:35,56 --> 0:27:40,11
And I get a overnight
messenger thing from him.


652
0:27:40,11 --> 0:27:42,52
And it's a high-end
real estate magazine.


653
0:27:42,52 --> 0:27:45,2
And there's a
post-it on one page.


654
0:27:45,2 --> 0:27:49,78
And it's a post-it for a big
mansion in San Francisco.


655
0:27:49,78 --> 0:27:52,49
And it's like on Nob Hill
or somewhere like that.


656
0:27:52,49 --> 0:27:54,88
And he's undermining
the description


657
0:27:54,88 --> 0:27:58,91
about it having an 11,000
square foot basement.


658
0:27:58,91 --> 0:27:59,58
And I said, yes.


659
0:27:59,58 --> 0:28:3,0
But see, that's a
mansion in San Francisco.


660
0:28:3,0 --> 0:28:6,46
This is a tract home
in Southern California.


661
0:28:6,46 --> 0:28:9,7
It still bothers me, he said.


662
0:28:9,7 --> 0:28:14,11
And then when I ended up cutting
30 pages out of the text,


663
0:28:14,11 --> 0:28:15,39
out of 940.


664
0:28:15,39 --> 0:28:17,78
And we sent it off to them.


665
0:28:17,78 --> 0:28:19,25
And it went to typesetting.


666
0:28:19,25 --> 0:28:21,52
And when the typesetting
came, he said,


667
0:28:21,52 --> 0:28:23,8
Dean I'm sending you the
typesetting tomorrow.


668
0:28:23,8 --> 0:28:25,7
And you'll proofread
the typesetting.


669
0:28:25,7 --> 0:28:28,88
And you just please
understand there's still


670
0:28:28,88 --> 0:28:32,64
time to fix that
furnace problem.


671
0:28:32,64 --> 0:28:38,28
So at that point, and I
hated to dis an editor,


672
0:28:38,28 --> 0:28:40,83
so I tried to do it with humor.


673
0:28:40,83 --> 0:28:44,37
I wrote him back,
and I said, Alan,


674
0:28:44,37 --> 0:28:48,0
I've written a paragraph I hope
will fix the furnace problem.


675
0:28:48,0 --> 0:28:49,98
And this is the
paragraph I sent him.


676
0:28:49,98 --> 0:28:53,15
"In the garage was a furnace,
but not just any furnace.


677
0:28:53,15 --> 0:28:56,87
An immense furnace, a
huge bastard of a furnace,


678
0:28:56,87 --> 0:28:59,1
so enormous that
natural gas needed


679
0:28:59,1 --> 0:29:2,86
to operate it could have heated
the homes of 1,236 families.


680
0:29:2,86 --> 0:29:6,0
A furnace of such flagrant
excess and ungodly


681
0:29:6,0 --> 0:29:10,12
dimensions that no room was
left in the garage for cars.


682
0:29:10,12 --> 0:29:12,33
A furnace so complex
in its engineering


683
0:29:12,33 --> 0:29:14,82
and so formidable
in its mechanisms


684
0:29:14,82 --> 0:29:16,95
that while performing
routine maintenance,


685
0:29:16,95 --> 0:29:19,7
three repairmen had been killed.


686
0:29:19,7 --> 0:29:21,7
A furnace into which
a clever murderer


687
0:29:21,7 --> 0:29:26,67
could jam the body
of his editor,


688
0:29:26,67 --> 0:29:29,18
with every confidence
that no speck of evidence


689
0:29:29,18 --> 0:29:31,43
would survive the flames."


690
0:29:31,43 --> 0:29:32,81
[LAUGHTER]


691
0:29:32,81 --> 0:29:36,22
And he came back to me
and said, point taken.


692
0:29:36,22 --> 0:29:38,25
And the furnace stayed in it.


693
0:29:38,25 --> 0:29:41,4
That book went on to be my
first hardcover best seller.


694
0:29:41,4 --> 0:29:43,31
And the next book
was "Watchers,"


695
0:29:43,31 --> 0:29:46,2
which had a golden retriever
in it in a major way.


696
0:29:46,2 --> 0:29:48,35
And that book did
much, much better.


697
0:29:48,35 --> 0:29:51,45
And the next book, "Lightning,"
almost went to number one.


698
0:29:51,45 --> 0:29:53,9
And I could see
this progression.


699
0:29:53,9 --> 0:29:55,0
And it was very
exciting, because I


700
0:29:55,0 --> 0:29:58,98
had been working for 20 or
more years, trying to get here.


701
0:29:58,98 --> 0:30:2,84
And very next book after that
was a book called "Midnight."


702
0:30:2,84 --> 0:30:5,36
And it was my first
number one best seller.


703
0:30:5,36 --> 0:30:7,84
And this is absolutely true.


704
0:30:7,84 --> 0:30:11,27
My publisher, Phyllis Grann,
she was a very good publisher


705
0:30:11,27 --> 0:30:13,43
for a certain kind of thing.


706
0:30:13,43 --> 0:30:15,26
I always irritated
her, because I


707
0:30:15,26 --> 0:30:16,89
didn't do the same
book every time.


708
0:30:16,89 --> 0:30:19,8
And she really liked
publishing writers


709
0:30:19,8 --> 0:30:22,72
who did the same book every
time, because it was a product


710
0:30:22,72 --> 0:30:24,61
and she knew how to sell it.


711
0:30:24,61 --> 0:30:28,262
So we already were at
odds with each other.


712
0:30:28,262 --> 0:30:29,72
But I had a lot of
respect for her.


713
0:30:29,72 --> 0:30:30,594
And she called me up.


714
0:30:30,594 --> 0:30:33,37
And you learn about the best
seller list-- your first week,


715
0:30:33,37 --> 0:30:36,17
you learn about it 10 days
before it appears in the "New


716
0:30:36,17 --> 0:30:38,86
York Times," because the
book review comes out,


717
0:30:38,86 --> 0:30:40,35
they have to print that earlier.


718
0:30:40,35 --> 0:30:42,4
And they do the calculation.


719
0:30:42,4 --> 0:30:43,29
So you find out early.


720
0:30:43,29 --> 0:30:47,951
And she called me up and said,
I have very wonderful news


721
0:30:47,951 --> 0:30:48,45
for you.


722
0:30:48,45 --> 0:30:50,44
You're going to debut
with this book at number


723
0:30:50,44 --> 0:30:51,78
on in the "New York Times."


724
0:30:51,78 --> 0:30:53,63
And before I could
say a thing, she


725
0:30:53,63 --> 0:30:55,57
said, I just want
you to understand,


726
0:30:55,57 --> 0:30:58,56
this will never
happen for you again.


727
0:30:58,56 --> 0:31:0,24
You do not write
the kind of books


728
0:31:0,24 --> 0:31:2,1
that can go to number one.


729
0:31:2,1 --> 0:31:4,3
We had five number
ones in a row.


730
0:31:4,3 --> 0:31:6,13
And every time I
had a number one,


731
0:31:6,13 --> 0:31:8,41
she told me the same thing.


732
0:31:8,41 --> 0:31:11,12
And I'm a little slow,
but not that slow.


733
0:31:11,12 --> 0:31:13,64
I said, you know what, I
need a different publisher.


734
0:31:13,64 --> 0:31:15,87
And I moved on from there.


735
0:31:15,87 --> 0:31:18,1
So that's been
some of my career.


736
0:31:18,1 --> 0:31:21,88
And we want to leave time in
this for-- I can babble on--


737
0:31:21,88 --> 0:31:23,84
but for some
question and answers.


738
0:31:23,84 --> 0:31:27,15
I assume you have
some questions.


739
0:31:27,15 --> 0:31:29,722
AUDIENCE: So
basically, I've been


740
0:31:29,722 --> 0:31:30,93
reading your books for years.


741
0:31:30,93 --> 0:31:32,1
I've really enjoyed them.


742
0:31:32,1 --> 0:31:34,27
And it's exciting when
a new one comes out.


743
0:31:34,27 --> 0:31:35,89
But one of the
things I like to do


744
0:31:35,89 --> 0:31:38,82
when I go to talks by
authors that I really like


745
0:31:38,82 --> 0:31:41,4
is ask them who they're reading.


746
0:31:41,4 --> 0:31:44,197
So do you have any people,
especially up-and-coming people


747
0:31:44,197 --> 0:31:46,53
who you think are writing
really good and exciting books


748
0:31:46,53 --> 0:31:49,53
right now that I might use
to expand my reading list?


749
0:31:49,53 --> 0:31:54,78
DEAN KOONTZ: I like this--
now I'm going to draw a blank.


750
0:31:54,78 --> 0:31:59,64
Michael Michael Koryta is a very
good suspense writer, young,


751
0:31:59,64 --> 0:32:1,2
starting up.


752
0:32:1,2 --> 0:32:3,59
I don't have a lot of time
at this point in my life


753
0:32:3,59 --> 0:32:6,51
to read fiction like I used to.


754
0:32:6,51 --> 0:32:7,956
If you've read my
books, you know


755
0:32:7,956 --> 0:32:9,39
there's a lot of
research in them,


756
0:32:9,39 --> 0:32:14,57
because I learned early that
if you screw up a detail,


757
0:32:14,57 --> 0:32:16,57
there are people reading
you who will know that.


758
0:32:16,57 --> 0:32:17,694
And then they'll write you.


759
0:32:17,694 --> 0:32:20,52
And then you'll
feel like an idiot.


760
0:32:20,52 --> 0:32:22,36
Especially if it's a gun detail.


761
0:32:22,36 --> 0:32:25,38
Oh my, you will get mail.


762
0:32:25,38 --> 0:32:27,97
So I make sure all
detail in it is right.


763
0:32:27,97 --> 0:32:30,29
And I just tend to
be writing subjects.


764
0:32:30,29 --> 0:32:32,53
When I was a kid in
college and high school


765
0:32:32,53 --> 0:32:35,2
and I had to go to the
library to research something,


766
0:32:35,2 --> 0:32:36,63
I hated that.


767
0:32:36,63 --> 0:32:38,51
I hated research.


768
0:32:38,51 --> 0:32:41,72
This is mortifying to
admit now, but it's true.


769
0:32:41,72 --> 0:32:43,89
So in high school,
I would always


770
0:32:43,89 --> 0:32:47,43
just-- when I had to do
a paper on something,


771
0:32:47,43 --> 0:32:51,63
I would make up the titles of
the books that I referenced.


772
0:32:51,63 --> 0:32:53,95
And I would make up the authors.


773
0:32:53,95 --> 0:32:57,39
And I'd assigned the book to
Doubleday or somebody else.


774
0:32:57,39 --> 0:32:59,94
And I'd cite the page
and chapter number.


775
0:32:59,94 --> 0:33:3,16
And nobody ever caught me at it.


776
0:33:3,16 --> 0:33:4,52
And I got good grades.


777
0:33:4,52 --> 0:33:10,5
And so I could have gone
into a life of crime.


778
0:33:10,5 --> 0:33:13,45
But when I went to
college, I fell in love


779
0:33:13,45 --> 0:33:15,97
with pinochle in my
first year in college.


780
0:33:15,97 --> 0:33:18,107
And it turned out I
was pretty good at it.


781
0:33:18,107 --> 0:33:19,94
And I met this other
guy who was good at it.


782
0:33:19,94 --> 0:33:21,44
And we became the two to beat.


783
0:33:21,44 --> 0:33:23,73
So we'd have all-night
pinochle things.


784
0:33:23,73 --> 0:33:25,96
And I wouldn't
often go to class.


785
0:33:25,96 --> 0:33:31,62
And so I took up the habit
of faking my research papers.


786
0:33:31,62 --> 0:33:35,3
And I never got caught
at it in college either.


787
0:33:35,3 --> 0:33:37,54
You should never bring your
own children to one of my--


788
0:33:37,54 --> 0:33:40,77



789
0:33:40,77 --> 0:33:45,15
And then when I was a junior,
at the end of my junior year,


790
0:33:45,15 --> 0:33:47,647
a professor of mine had
submitted a short story


791
0:33:47,647 --> 0:33:49,23
I'd written to the
"Atlantic Monthly,"


792
0:33:49,23 --> 0:33:52,1
for the college writing
competition they did.


793
0:33:52,1 --> 0:33:54,5
And it won the
short story prize.


794
0:33:54,5 --> 0:33:57,9
And after that, I really
became a slacker in college,


795
0:33:57,9 --> 0:34:0,64
because my final year was
nothing but English classes


796
0:34:0,64 --> 0:34:1,85
and literature classes.


797
0:34:1,85 --> 0:34:4,17
And I was the first
person at the university


798
0:34:4,17 --> 0:34:6,28
ever to win one of these.


799
0:34:6,28 --> 0:34:7,49
And I could do no wrong.


800
0:34:7,49 --> 0:34:9,98
It was just fabulous.


801
0:34:9,98 --> 0:34:14,62
So I played more pinochle
and made up more papers.


802
0:34:14,62 --> 0:34:18,27
But when I became a novelist
and I had to get it right,


803
0:34:18,27 --> 0:34:20,929
I found out I loved research.


804
0:34:20,929 --> 0:34:25,23
And so now I do so much
of it, outside of Michael,


805
0:34:25,23 --> 0:34:29,54
I love this-- she
writes kids books,


806
0:34:29,54 --> 0:34:33,6
but adults will love
them-- Kate DiCamillo.


807
0:34:33,6 --> 0:34:37,31
And she has this book called
"The Tale of Despereaux,"


808
0:34:37,31 --> 0:34:39,909
and another one.


809
0:34:39,909 --> 0:34:42,23
Adults will laugh their
heads off at these books.


810
0:34:42,23 --> 0:34:46,59
Kids do love them, but
there's humor in them


811
0:34:46,59 --> 0:34:47,92
that only adults will get.


812
0:34:47,92 --> 0:34:51,61
For instance, she has this
one "The Incredible Journey


813
0:34:51,61 --> 0:34:55,719
of Edward--" I can't
remember the second name.


814
0:34:55,719 --> 0:34:58,8
But Edwards is a
ceramic rabbit that's


815
0:34:58,8 --> 0:35:2,85
clothed and has bendable
ears and is an antique doll.


816
0:35:2,85 --> 0:35:6,5
And he's not animated
like other kids.


817
0:35:6,5 --> 0:35:10,57
He thinks, but he can't
talk and he can't move.


818
0:35:10,57 --> 0:35:12,57
So Edward is simply
the victim of what


819
0:35:12,57 --> 0:35:15,47
happens to him in his journeys.


820
0:35:15,47 --> 0:35:17,82
And it's hilarious and moving.


821
0:35:17,82 --> 0:35:19,55
And I just think she's great.


822
0:35:19,55 --> 0:35:23,0
And she writes books, "The
Magician's Elephant," a little


823
0:35:23,0 --> 0:35:23,72
short book.


824
0:35:23,72 --> 0:35:26,58
And it's a wonderful,
absolutely wonderful book


825
0:35:26,58 --> 0:35:31,6
about how our life-- and I
wrote a really long book called


826
0:35:31,6 --> 0:35:33,22
"From the Corner
of His Eye," which


827
0:35:33,22 --> 0:35:37,17
takes quantum mechanics,
spooky effect at a distance,


828
0:35:37,17 --> 0:35:41,61
and says that that not only
works on the subatomic level,


829
0:35:41,61 --> 0:35:43,83
it works in human relationships.


830
0:35:43,83 --> 0:35:46,76
Everything we do has spooky
effects at a distance.


831
0:35:46,76 --> 0:35:50,4
When we do something good in
our lives or something bad,


832
0:35:50,4 --> 0:35:51,55
it affects other people.


833
0:35:51,55 --> 0:35:55,9
It changes what they might
do to somebody else that day.


834
0:35:55,9 --> 0:35:56,8
And it ricochets through
everybody's lives.


835
0:35:56,8 --> 0:35:59,794
And years later, if
you are able to see it,


836
0:35:59,794 --> 0:36:2,21
you would see, if you were
able to pull back and look over


837
0:36:2,21 --> 0:36:5,507
the years, how what you
did had this effect.


838
0:36:5,507 --> 0:36:7,34
You did it in Pittsburgh,
it had this effect


839
0:36:7,34 --> 0:36:11,52
in San Diego three years later.


840
0:36:11,52 --> 0:36:13,79
I took like 800 pages of this.


841
0:36:13,79 --> 0:36:16,2
Kate DiCamillo does it
in this little kids' book


842
0:36:16,2 --> 0:36:18,6
that any adult will
love it as well.


843
0:36:18,6 --> 0:36:19,13
So those are people.


844
0:36:19,13 --> 0:36:22,46
But mainly I read research
and philosophy these days.


845
0:36:22,46 --> 0:36:23,81
AUDIENCE: Thank you.


846
0:36:23,81 --> 0:36:27,28
DEAN KOONTZ: Sorry,
that's a long answer.


847
0:36:27,28 --> 0:36:27,86
AUDIENCE: Hi.


848
0:36:27,86 --> 0:36:29,235
First I just wanted
to thank you,


849
0:36:29,235 --> 0:36:30,915
because I had
isolating childhood.


850
0:36:30,915 --> 0:36:34,64
And at age 13, I
read "Whispers."


851
0:36:34,64 --> 0:36:37,39
And I escaped
through your books.


852
0:36:37,39 --> 0:36:40,67
And so I just wanted
to thank you for that.


853
0:36:40,67 --> 0:36:45,98
Also my question is, you are
one of if not the most prolific


854
0:36:45,98 --> 0:36:48,76
author I've ever heard of.


855
0:36:48,76 --> 0:36:50,95
And it brings your
readers great joy


856
0:36:50,95 --> 0:36:52,684
to be able to keep
reading stories,


857
0:36:52,684 --> 0:36:54,85
like you said, like your
publisher pointed out, that


858
0:36:54,85 --> 0:36:56,52
aren't all the same.


859
0:36:56,52 --> 0:36:58,646
So I was wondering a little
bit about your process.


860
0:36:58,646 --> 0:37:0,52
I know everybody, when
they're falling asleep


861
0:37:0,52 --> 0:37:1,68
has a million ideas.


862
0:37:1,68 --> 0:37:5,13
And I can't even imagine
someone who has so many ideas


863
0:37:5,13 --> 0:37:7,85
they have the book
that you have.


864
0:37:7,85 --> 0:37:10,59
Do you have stuff just
come at you all the time,


865
0:37:10,59 --> 0:37:12,6
and you have to
process it in a way?


866
0:37:12,6 --> 0:37:16,425
Or do you just sit down?


867
0:37:16,425 --> 0:37:18,55
DEAN KOONTZ: Each book is
different to some extent.


868
0:37:18,55 --> 0:37:21,48
Some I can tell you
where the book came from.


869
0:37:21,48 --> 0:37:25,85
And it was a struggle,
or it wasn't.


870
0:37:25,85 --> 0:37:31,25
I was coming home from a
meeting at a studio in LA


871
0:37:31,25 --> 0:37:33,44
on a film development
project with a bunch


872
0:37:33,44 --> 0:37:34,59
of studio executives.


873
0:37:34,59 --> 0:37:38,33
And you always come
out of those meetings


874
0:37:38,33 --> 0:37:40,99
in a psychopathic frame of mind.


875
0:37:40,99 --> 0:37:43,48
And I had driven my wife's SUV.


876
0:37:43,48 --> 0:37:46,98
And so the deck was filled
with Simon & Garfunkel,


877
0:37:46,98 --> 0:37:50,43
Because she likes that,
or Paul Simon on his own.


878
0:37:50,43 --> 0:37:55,9
And I was coming home, and
a song came up, "Patterns."


879
0:37:55,9 --> 0:37:56,982
And there's a line
in it. "My life


880
0:37:56,982 --> 0:37:59,81
is made of patterns that
can scarcely be controlled."


881
0:37:59,81 --> 0:38:3,93
And at that moment I thought,
there's a novel in that.


882
0:38:3,93 --> 0:38:7,2
Somebody knows that there's
a pattern of things going


883
0:38:7,2 --> 0:38:11,81
to happen in his life, and
he has no control over them.


884
0:38:11,81 --> 0:38:14,5
What would that
mean in his life?


885
0:38:14,5 --> 0:38:17,85
And in about 15
minutes, I had the idea


886
0:38:17,85 --> 0:38:20,64
for this guy who's
an ordinary baker.


887
0:38:20,64 --> 0:38:22,74
And he comes from
a family of bakers.


888
0:38:22,74 --> 0:38:26,72
And they're proud of
their expertise as bakers.


889
0:38:26,72 --> 0:38:30,74
And the book would open
the night he was born.


890
0:38:30,74 --> 0:38:35,86
And his father would be in the
hospital to witness his birth,


891
0:38:35,86 --> 0:38:39,92
but was also in the hospital
because his father's father is


892
0:38:39,92 --> 0:38:41,72
dying after a stroke.


893
0:38:41,72 --> 0:38:44,27
And he's going back and
forth from death the birth


894
0:38:44,27 --> 0:38:45,43
in the hospital.


895
0:38:45,43 --> 0:38:50,77
And in the fathers lounge,
expectant fathers lounge,


896
0:38:50,77 --> 0:38:55,8
which in those days would
have done it a different way.


897
0:38:55,8 --> 0:38:59,9
Our lead's father is waiting
to be told he's been born.


898
0:38:59,9 --> 0:39:0,81
And the only other
person in there


899
0:39:0,81 --> 0:39:4,34
is this angry, chain-smoking--
and when I was writing it,


900
0:39:4,34 --> 0:39:5,68
I wrote clown.


901
0:39:5,68 --> 0:39:6,41
And I stopped.


902
0:39:6,41 --> 0:39:7,57
I never do outlines.


903
0:39:7,57 --> 0:39:10,25
So I just take a
premise and go with it.


904
0:39:10,25 --> 0:39:12,79
And I stopped and said, clown.


905
0:39:12,79 --> 0:39:14,7
That's too ridiculous.


906
0:39:14,7 --> 0:39:17,43
And then I wrote him as what
an Emmett Kelly clown is.


907
0:39:17,43 --> 0:39:20,64
Not somebody with the giant
shoes, but a sad sack.


908
0:39:20,64 --> 0:39:23,9
Might have a funny
nose on, but he's


909
0:39:23,9 --> 0:39:25,59
a different kind
of clown than that.


910
0:39:25,59 --> 0:39:27,84
And it turned out that if
I hadn't written clown,


911
0:39:27,84 --> 0:39:29,59
that novel would never
have been the novel


912
0:39:29,59 --> 0:39:32,14
it was, because it
became everything.


913
0:39:32,14 --> 0:39:35,245
Because it became a
psychopathic family of clowns.


914
0:39:35,245 --> 0:39:39,12
And it's a comic novel
that's also a suspense novel.


915
0:39:39,12 --> 0:39:41,9
That wrote almost
itself, because I


916
0:39:41,9 --> 0:39:43,5
was having so much fun.


917
0:39:43,5 --> 0:39:47,56
Certain other books are harder,
maybe because you're not


918
0:39:47,56 --> 0:39:48,88
having as much fun.


919
0:39:48,88 --> 0:39:50,95
And then every great
once in a while,


920
0:39:50,95 --> 0:39:54,9
you write one in a flow state.


921
0:39:54,9 --> 0:39:57,88
The reason prolific is because
I get up at quarter of 6:00


922
0:39:57,88 --> 0:39:58,96
in the morning.


923
0:39:58,96 --> 0:40:2,12
I shower, walk the dog.


924
0:40:2,12 --> 0:40:6,42
I eat breakfast at the desk, and
I'm at the desk by, 7:00, 7:15.


925
0:40:6,42 --> 0:40:7,95
And I work through until dinner.


926
0:40:7,95 --> 0:40:10,69
And I do that at
least six days a week.


927
0:40:10,69 --> 0:40:13,75
If I'm on a deadline,
it goes to seven.


928
0:40:13,75 --> 0:40:17,34
And so there's a
lot of time put in.


929
0:40:17,34 --> 0:40:20,78
But if you get into a
flow state, which athletes


930
0:40:20,78 --> 0:40:24,984
call being in the zone, I do,
like, 20 drafts a page or more.


931
0:40:24,984 --> 0:40:26,65
But I don't go on to
page two until I've


932
0:40:26,65 --> 0:40:28,23
done that many on page one.


933
0:40:28,23 --> 0:40:30,76
I just refine it
until I feel that-- I


934
0:40:30,76 --> 0:40:31,98
have a lot of self-doubt.


935
0:40:31,98 --> 0:40:34,3
So I have to feel
that the page is


936
0:40:34,3 --> 0:40:37,34
really good before
I can move on.


937
0:40:37,34 --> 0:40:39,3
And I go through
a book that way.


938
0:40:39,3 --> 0:40:40,59
It's sort of like
coral reefs are


939
0:40:40,59 --> 0:40:43,76
built with all these dead
little calcareous skeletons.


940
0:40:43,76 --> 0:40:48,47
And mine are done with all these
dead little abandoned sentences


941
0:40:48,47 --> 0:40:52,51
that I've piled up
until the book is right.


942
0:40:52,51 --> 0:40:55,12
But there's some times that
I'll still do those drafts.


943
0:40:55,12 --> 0:40:58,78
But they fly by, because
you're in this place


944
0:40:58,78 --> 0:41:1,45
that you can't make
yourself go to.


945
0:41:1,45 --> 0:41:3,64
And "Innocence" was
a book like that.


946
0:41:3,64 --> 0:41:5,9
"Innocence" just
flew. "Watchers"


947
0:41:5,9 --> 0:41:8,9
was a book that had
a lot of that in it.


948
0:41:8,9 --> 0:41:11,29
So you're not in control.


949
0:41:11,29 --> 0:41:15,14
I say to young writers,
the best thing you can do--


950
0:41:15,14 --> 0:41:18,32
and I have a lot of problem
with writers understanding, even


951
0:41:18,32 --> 0:41:19,99
writers I know and respect.


952
0:41:19,99 --> 0:41:22,34
I say, I never
planned the character.


953
0:41:22,34 --> 0:41:24,29
I know a little bit about him.


954
0:41:24,29 --> 0:41:26,22
I know what his central
problem will be.


955
0:41:26,22 --> 0:41:27,76
And then I give him free will.


956
0:41:27,76 --> 0:41:30,48
God gave us free will to do
the right thing, wrong thing,


957
0:41:30,48 --> 0:41:32,29
screw up, not.


958
0:41:32,29 --> 0:41:34,44
And I give the
character free will.


959
0:41:34,44 --> 0:41:36,295
But people say,
but no you don't.


960
0:41:36,295 --> 0:41:37,545
You're creating the character.


961
0:41:37,545 --> 0:41:40,6
And I say, the
strangest thing happens.


962
0:41:40,6 --> 0:41:43,54
If you don't think it ahead,
and I don't think ahead


963
0:41:43,54 --> 0:41:44,24
what's coming.


964
0:41:44,24 --> 0:41:47,28
I just let the characters
interact with each other.


965
0:41:47,28 --> 0:41:51,68
When I'm writing, if it's
comic element in the novel,


966
0:41:51,68 --> 0:41:54,48
I'm often laughing
out loud in my office.


967
0:41:54,48 --> 0:41:57,26
At other times, I can
be moved to tears,


968
0:41:57,26 --> 0:42:0,25
and be sitting there
crying at the typewriter.


969
0:42:0,25 --> 0:42:1,55
My assistant is here today.


970
0:42:1,55 --> 0:42:3,7
I think people who
work in the house who


971
0:42:3,7 --> 0:42:6,97
pass my office door think I
should be in an institution.


972
0:42:6,97 --> 0:42:9,21
And there's many
other good arguments


973
0:42:9,21 --> 0:42:10,81
for that, but not just this.


974
0:42:10,81 --> 0:42:12,49
But that's how I work.


975
0:42:12,49 --> 0:42:13,62
And it all gets done.


976
0:42:13,62 --> 0:42:15,87
And I'm always amazed that
there's a new book done.


977
0:42:15,87 --> 0:42:17,18
But it does.


978
0:42:17,18 --> 0:42:19,44
And I think you have
to love it to be


979
0:42:19,44 --> 0:42:21,45
able to stay at it
all these years.


980
0:42:21,45 --> 0:42:22,5
And I do love it.


981
0:42:22,5 --> 0:42:23,715
I love the process.


982
0:42:23,715 --> 0:42:25,47
AUDIENCE: Well, we
love that you love it.


983
0:42:25,47 --> 0:42:27,32
We're always amazed
by the end product.


984
0:42:27,32 --> 0:42:29,8
And I'm halfway
through "Innocence."


985
0:42:29,8 --> 0:42:30,882
I preordered it.


986
0:42:30,882 --> 0:42:31,59
I was like, yeah!


987
0:42:31,59 --> 0:42:33,806
So thank you, so much.


988
0:42:33,806 --> 0:42:34,93
DEAN KOONTZ: No, thank you.


989
0:42:34,93 --> 0:42:35,83
You buy my shoes.


990
0:42:35,83 --> 0:42:38,595
[LAUGHTER]


991
0:42:38,595 --> 0:42:40,47
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
coming, and thank you


992
0:42:40,47 --> 0:42:43,3
for telling us about
your writing process.


993
0:42:43,3 --> 0:42:44,59
I was interested in
what you had said


994
0:42:44,59 --> 0:42:47,61
about your very early
research process.


995
0:42:47,61 --> 0:42:50,27
I'm just wondering if you could
maybe say a little bit more


996
0:42:50,27 --> 0:42:51,68
about how you research now.


997
0:42:51,68 --> 0:42:53,61
I mean, it must
be very disruptive


998
0:42:53,61 --> 0:42:56,12
compared to your
regular writing style.


999
0:42:56,12 --> 0:42:59,5
So can you tell us a little bit
more about how you research,


1000
0:42:59,5 --> 0:43:2,53
and how it's changed
over the years?


1001
0:43:2,53 --> 0:43:6,59
DEAN KOONTZ: Well, in many
ways, it hasn't changed for me.


1002
0:43:6,59 --> 0:43:10,2
From the day I could start to
afford to buy hardcover books,


1003
0:43:10,2 --> 0:43:11,52
I went completely nuts.


1004
0:43:11,52 --> 0:43:14,37
And if I was in a
bookstore and I saw a book


1005
0:43:14,37 --> 0:43:20,41
on a very bizarre subject,
you know, like-- I can't even


1006
0:43:20,41 --> 0:43:21,99
think of a bizarre
subject right now.


1007
0:43:21,99 --> 0:43:25,44
But if I saw a reference
book that I thought,


1008
0:43:25,44 --> 0:43:30,51
I'll never see that subject
again, I would buy it,


1009
0:43:30,51 --> 0:43:32,2
until we got a
library that probably


1010
0:43:32,2 --> 0:43:35,4
has something like
70,000 books in it.


1011
0:43:35,4 --> 0:43:37,65
And I built this library
that almost anything


1012
0:43:37,65 --> 0:43:40,97
I want to know about I've got
a number of books about it.


1013
0:43:40,97 --> 0:43:43,52
Then this other thing
happened as books


1014
0:43:43,52 --> 0:43:44,91
became more and more successful.


1015
0:43:44,91 --> 0:43:48,55
I would get letters from
readers in the mail.


1016
0:43:48,55 --> 0:43:53,186
And some of them would be people
who say-- well, one example


1017
0:43:53,186 --> 0:43:54,56
I can give, this
fellow wrote me,


1018
0:43:54,56 --> 0:43:55,94
and he was in the Marine Corps.


1019
0:43:55,94 --> 0:43:59,2
And he taught actually
not just marines,


1020
0:43:59,2 --> 0:44:2,95
but helicopter pilots
in all the services.


1021
0:44:2,95 --> 0:44:5,22
And he ran all the
simulators for them.


1022
0:44:5,22 --> 0:44:8,39
And he said to me, if you ever
need a military helicopter


1023
0:44:8,39 --> 0:44:9,96
in this and you
want to know what


1024
0:44:9,96 --> 0:44:13,5
it's like, I can
give you details.


1025
0:44:13,5 --> 0:44:16,14
And also you can come and
run through the simulator.


1026
0:44:16,14 --> 0:44:17,94
So at that point,
I realized there's


1027
0:44:17,94 --> 0:44:20,3
some value in keeping
a drawer in my office


1028
0:44:20,3 --> 0:44:22,58
where I just keep all these
people with specialized


1029
0:44:22,58 --> 0:44:23,53
knowledge.


1030
0:44:23,53 --> 0:44:26,37
And there's nothing better
than calling somebody like that


1031
0:44:26,37 --> 0:44:28,31
and asking him,
or going and being


1032
0:44:28,31 --> 0:44:32,45
put through the simulator, which
I crashed over and over again.


1033
0:44:32,45 --> 0:44:34,82
And it's why I don't fly.


1034
0:44:34,82 --> 0:44:37,83
I think even as a passenger
I'm going to crash the plane.


1035
0:44:37,83 --> 0:44:42,8
But I don't go online
to do the research.


1036
0:44:42,8 --> 0:44:45,8
Because you'd be amazed at
what computer I'm working on.


1037
0:44:45,8 --> 0:44:47,45
I'm on DOS yet.


1038
0:44:47,45 --> 0:44:49,77
And the reason is I
have to first Windows.


1039
0:44:49,77 --> 0:44:51,57
Isn't that Windows?


1040
0:44:51,57 --> 0:44:53,11
First Windows.


1041
0:44:53,11 --> 0:44:54,54
And I didn't like Windows.


1042
0:44:54,54 --> 0:44:56,95
I liked the word
processing enormously.


1043
0:44:56,95 --> 0:44:59,51
That's all I do on it,
is write letters or text.


1044
0:44:59,51 --> 0:45:1,77
I didn't want to be
going through Windows.


1045
0:45:1,77 --> 0:45:5,43
And Linda, my assistant,
took Windows out of it.


1046
0:45:5,43 --> 0:45:8,67
Well, in later versions, you
couldn't take the Windows out


1047
0:45:8,67 --> 0:45:9,17
of it.


1048
0:45:9,17 --> 0:45:12,185
So now I'm still
working-- I still


1049
0:45:12,185 --> 0:45:14,86
have that logic unit,
as they called them.


1050
0:45:14,86 --> 0:45:16,3
I still have one
of those towers.


1051
0:45:16,3 --> 0:45:18,94
We have a spare
in the other room.


1052
0:45:18,94 --> 0:45:22,17
I have a new keyboard,
but new keyboards


1053
0:45:22,17 --> 0:45:24,76
won't work with my
antique arrangement.


1054
0:45:24,76 --> 0:45:27,73
So we have one that will,
if that one breaks down,


1055
0:45:27,73 --> 0:45:30,95
and a printer that will work,
and another one to back it up.


1056
0:45:30,95 --> 0:45:34,45
And I'm so stick
in the mud, I don't


1057
0:45:34,45 --> 0:45:36,5
want to learn new software,
which will slow down


1058
0:45:36,5 --> 0:45:38,75
my writing more than
the research would.


1059
0:45:38,75 --> 0:45:40,91
So I just want to stay with it.


1060
0:45:40,91 --> 0:45:42,62
And when someday
it all explodes,


1061
0:45:42,62 --> 0:45:43,89
then my career is over.


1062
0:45:43,89 --> 0:45:46,33
Or I have to learn
a new software.


1063
0:45:46,33 --> 0:45:51,35
I did an interview with Anthony
Mason for CBS "Sunday Morning."


1064
0:45:51,35 --> 0:45:53,252
And he's a wonderful
interviewer.


1065
0:45:53,252 --> 0:45:54,96
And they were there
for a couple of days.


1066
0:45:54,96 --> 0:45:57,34
And the second day, we
walked into my office.


1067
0:45:57,34 --> 0:45:58,5
And they hadn't seen it.


1068
0:45:58,5 --> 0:46:1,2
And he looked, and he said,
what the hell is that?


1069
0:46:1,2 --> 0:46:5,14
And I said to him, it's
amazing it isn't steam driven,


1070
0:46:5,14 --> 0:46:9,41
given how anti-technology-- not
anti-technology, but how slow


1071
0:46:9,41 --> 0:46:10,76
I am to pick up technology.


1072
0:46:10,76 --> 0:46:13,71
So if I want to use the
internet now for research,


1073
0:46:13,71 --> 0:46:15,826
I go to Linda over
there and say Linda,


1074
0:46:15,826 --> 0:46:16,95
here's what I need to know.


1075
0:46:16,95 --> 0:46:21,28
And it's amazing to me how
quickly she gets it to me.


1076
0:46:21,28 --> 0:46:23,77
So I know it must be an
amazing world out there,


1077
0:46:23,77 --> 0:46:26,25
but my world is inner.


1078
0:46:26,25 --> 0:46:28,2
Fiction is a very
internal thing,


1079
0:46:28,2 --> 0:46:30,59
and you have to get lost
in yourself to write it.


1080
0:46:30,59 --> 0:46:34,33
And yes, you also have to
love people and the world.


1081
0:46:34,33 --> 0:46:35,9
But when you're
writing it, you have


1082
0:46:35,9 --> 0:46:38,23
to separate yourself from that.


1083
0:46:38,23 --> 0:46:42,29
And I have to turn off the
world when I'm doing it.


1084
0:46:42,29 --> 0:46:46,27
And as Linda will
testify, it gets


1085
0:46:46,27 --> 0:46:49,93
so bad toward the
last few weeks of it


1086
0:46:49,93 --> 0:46:52,29
that I'll get up in the
morning, and I'll forget.


1087
0:46:52,29 --> 0:46:54,62
For like three
days, I won't shave.


1088
0:46:54,62 --> 0:46:55,602
I won't shower.


1089
0:46:55,602 --> 0:46:57,56
I'll think I showered
yesterday, but I haven't.


1090
0:46:57,56 --> 0:46:59,46
I pull on a baseball cap.


1091
0:46:59,46 --> 0:47:0,54
And I go down.


1092
0:47:0,54 --> 0:47:2,7
And what does everybody
in the house call it?


1093
0:47:2,7 --> 0:47:4,12
LINDA: I call it troll mode.


1094
0:47:4,12 --> 0:47:6,13
DEAN KOONTZ: Troll mode
is what she calls it.


1095
0:47:6,13 --> 0:47:8,9
And I probably pretty
much look like a troll


1096
0:47:8,9 --> 0:47:9,5
by the end of that.


1097
0:47:9,5 --> 0:47:11,82
But I get so caught up in it,
I just want to get back to it


1098
0:47:11,82 --> 0:47:15,976
with no interruption when
I'm right at the end.


1099
0:47:15,976 --> 0:47:17,35
That's as much as
I can tell you.


1100
0:47:17,35 --> 0:47:19,76
Although I will say
there's one other change.


1101
0:47:19,76 --> 0:47:22,83
A lot of what I do
now with research


1102
0:47:22,83 --> 0:47:26,2
is not researching anything.


1103
0:47:26,2 --> 0:47:28,47
More and more, I've been
reading all kind of philosophy,


1104
0:47:28,47 --> 0:47:31,61
because philosophy can drive
different kind of ideas,


1105
0:47:31,61 --> 0:47:33,59
then you get other ways.


1106
0:47:33,59 --> 0:47:36,49
And it can drive the
sort of subtext of books


1107
0:47:36,49 --> 0:47:37,84
in ways you wouldn't
otherwise think about.


1108
0:47:37,84 --> 0:47:41,3
So there was this
sociologist but philosopher


1109
0:47:41,3 --> 0:47:43,86
called Phillip "Reef" or Rieff.


1110
0:47:43,86 --> 0:47:44,959
He was out of Princeton.


1111
0:47:44,959 --> 0:47:46,5
I've never heard
his name pronounced.


1112
0:47:46,5 --> 0:47:47,958
And he's written
a number of books.


1113
0:47:47,958 --> 0:47:49,4
Died not too long ago.


1114
0:47:49,4 --> 0:47:53,67
And they're cultural criticism,
but they're also philosophy.


1115
0:47:53,67 --> 0:47:57,28
I have gotten numerous ideas
out of just reading those books.


1116
0:47:57,28 --> 0:48:0,23
They're very difficult, but
they're also very illuminating.


1117
0:48:0,23 --> 0:48:2,4
So that's it.


1118
0:48:2,4 --> 0:48:3,69
AUDIENCE: Thank you.


1119
0:48:3,69 --> 0:48:5,47
DEAN KOONTZ: We probably
have some time for a few more


1120
0:48:5,47 --> 0:48:5,969
questions.


1121
0:48:5,969 --> 0:48:7,537
We don't want to--


1122
0:48:7,537 --> 0:48:8,37
AUDIENCE: Hey, Dean.


1123
0:48:8,37 --> 0:48:8,71
How you doing?


1124
0:48:8,71 --> 0:48:10,27
Thanks for coming
out and seeing us.


1125
0:48:10,27 --> 0:48:13,75
But seeing around here
all the golden retrievers,


1126
0:48:13,75 --> 0:48:16,25
I think this is going to be
a very relevant question.


1127
0:48:16,25 --> 0:48:19,73
The first book I actually ever
read in my life was "Watchers."


1128
0:48:19,73 --> 0:48:21,22
|t was given to be my mother.


1129
0:48:21,22 --> 0:48:23,49
And I think I was
around 10 years old.


1130
0:48:23,49 --> 0:48:26,1
And I think my question
I have for that


1131
0:48:26,1 --> 0:48:28,62
is-- this is more particular.


1132
0:48:28,62 --> 0:48:32,45
Where did the idea for the
antagonist, a creature,


1133
0:48:32,45 --> 0:48:35,91
as well as the other
antagonist, like Vince Nasco,


1134
0:48:35,91 --> 0:48:37,23
where did that stuff come from?


1135
0:48:37,23 --> 0:48:41,62
And I'm assuming since
you're a dog lover, that


1136
0:48:41,62 --> 0:48:44,1
fueled the Einstein
portions of the book.


1137
0:48:44,1 --> 0:48:48,68
But my main question is where
did that book in its entirety


1138
0:48:48,68 --> 0:48:49,81
come from?


1139
0:48:49,81 --> 0:48:53,69
DEAN KOONTZ: That goes
back such a long way now.


1140
0:48:53,69 --> 0:48:57,24



1141
0:48:57,24 --> 0:48:59,95
People assume I had golden
retrievers, or I had dogs.


1142
0:48:59,95 --> 0:49:0,52
I didn't.


1143
0:49:0,52 --> 0:49:1,67
I'd never had.


1144
0:49:1,67 --> 0:49:3,7
When I was a kid,
my father got a dog


1145
0:49:3,7 --> 0:49:5,155
for a very short period of time.


1146
0:49:5,155 --> 0:49:8,4
He was going to teach
to be a hunting dog.


1147
0:49:8,4 --> 0:49:10,125
He kept it on a
chain in the yard.


1148
0:49:10,125 --> 0:49:11,5
It's the worst
thing you could do


1149
0:49:11,5 --> 0:49:13,6
for a dog is tie it up outside.


1150
0:49:13,6 --> 0:49:14,61
They're pack animals.


1151
0:49:14,61 --> 0:49:16,9
And the dog only lasted a
week, because I went out


1152
0:49:16,9 --> 0:49:19,58
to play with it, and it
was so enthusiastic it


1153
0:49:19,58 --> 0:49:20,96
wrapped its chain
around my neck.


1154
0:49:20,96 --> 0:49:22,741
And if my mother
hadn't looked out,


1155
0:49:22,741 --> 0:49:24,24
it probably would
have strangled me.


1156
0:49:24,24 --> 0:49:27,9
Because when she came out
and managed to get it off,


1157
0:49:27,9 --> 0:49:31,6
for days, I had the imprints of
chain lengths around my throat.


1158
0:49:31,6 --> 0:49:35,399
And then we had a little dog
for a week or so that somebody


1159
0:49:35,399 --> 0:49:37,315
gave us because they
couldn't take care of it.


1160
0:49:37,315 --> 0:49:39,42
And it died shortly thereafter.


1161
0:49:39,42 --> 0:49:40,5
So I'd never had a dog.


1162
0:49:40,5 --> 0:49:41,9
But I loved golden retrievers.


1163
0:49:41,9 --> 0:49:43,87
And I had an aunt who
didn't have a retriever,


1164
0:49:43,87 --> 0:49:45,13
but a dog I loved.


1165
0:49:45,13 --> 0:49:46,21
And I just loved dogs.


1166
0:49:46,21 --> 0:49:49,44
And where the idea came
from that I would write


1167
0:49:49,44 --> 0:49:51,8
a novel about genetic
experiments and enhanced


1168
0:49:51,8 --> 0:49:55,182
intelligence, and they
would be working on a dog,


1169
0:49:55,182 --> 0:49:56,64
and it would be a
golden retriever,


1170
0:49:56,64 --> 0:49:58,78
I can't tell you
where that came from.


1171
0:49:58,78 --> 0:50:0,89
But I do know that
because you have


1172
0:50:0,89 --> 0:50:5,49
to have conflict in
any work of fiction,


1173
0:50:5,49 --> 0:50:8,73
it came to me pretty quickly
that this same outfit might


1174
0:50:8,73 --> 0:50:12,68
have been doing experiments
on a new kind of soldier


1175
0:50:12,68 --> 0:50:13,56
for the battlefield.


1176
0:50:13,56 --> 0:50:15,92
It would be a
genetically-engineered creature


1177
0:50:15,92 --> 0:50:19,59
it would be completely obedient,
just a killing machine.


1178
0:50:19,59 --> 0:50:23,4
And then that these two would
be too smart for the people who


1179
0:50:23,4 --> 0:50:25,88
built them and made them,
this very intelligent


1180
0:50:25,88 --> 0:50:28,52
golden retriever with
human-level intelligence


1181
0:50:28,52 --> 0:50:31,44
and this creature
would both escape.


1182
0:50:31,44 --> 0:50:33,18
And the creature
hates the golden,


1183
0:50:33,18 --> 0:50:35,55
because everybody loved the
golden and everybody was


1184
0:50:35,55 --> 0:50:37,17
fearful of the creature.


1185
0:50:37,17 --> 0:50:39,71
And then the idea that
the creature-- you know,


1186
0:50:39,71 --> 0:50:42,15
this Frankenstein monster
is pretty pathetic


1187
0:50:42,15 --> 0:50:44,77
when you actually look,
especially in the movies.


1188
0:50:44,77 --> 0:50:46,942
There's this pathos in it.


1189
0:50:46,942 --> 0:50:49,4
And I thought this should be
this very frightening monster,


1190
0:50:49,4 --> 0:50:51,65
but it should also be
something that when


1191
0:50:51,65 --> 0:50:54,51
you get to the end of it,
you have such pity for it,


1192
0:50:54,51 --> 0:50:57,63
you almost hate to
see it be killed.


1193
0:50:57,63 --> 0:51:4,94
And then when it comes
to my human bad people--


1194
0:51:4,94 --> 0:51:7,82
the question or
the thing-- my wife


1195
0:51:7,82 --> 0:51:9,54
used to go to book
signings a lot.


1196
0:51:9,54 --> 0:51:13,87
And I never knew
why she would put up


1197
0:51:13,87 --> 0:51:15,65
with this, because
sometimes there


1198
0:51:15,65 --> 0:51:17,45
will be 2,000 people
in line, and it would


1199
0:51:17,45 --> 0:51:19,46
take seven hours or eight hours.


1200
0:51:19,46 --> 0:51:21,98
And she would stand beside
me and open the book


1201
0:51:21,98 --> 0:51:24,54
to the right page,
or fold it to me.


1202
0:51:24,54 --> 0:51:27,82
And at one point, I said
to her, I know what it is.


1203
0:51:27,82 --> 0:51:29,952
You think if one of them
turns out to have a gun,


1204
0:51:29,952 --> 0:51:31,91
you want to be there to
take it away from them.


1205
0:51:31,91 --> 0:51:33,72
Because you know I'm
not capable of it.


1206
0:51:33,72 --> 0:51:35,85
And she said, that's part of it.


1207
0:51:35,85 --> 0:51:39,27
My wife's 5 foot 2", but you'll
agree she could probably do it.


1208
0:51:39,27 --> 0:51:42,23



1209
0:51:42,23 --> 0:51:44,44
But people at those
books signings


1210
0:51:44,44 --> 0:51:45,96
would say to her-- the
one question most often


1211
0:51:45,96 --> 0:51:50,13
was, his villains-- how
do you sleep at night?


1212
0:51:50,13 --> 0:51:53,565
Because they think all this
is actually part of who I am.


1213
0:51:53,565 --> 0:51:57,95
And maybe it is, but so
far I haven't acted on it.


1214
0:51:57,95 --> 0:52:0,75
Having grown up in
a house-- my dad


1215
0:52:0,75 --> 0:52:5,94
lived-- he drank a
fifth a day, plus beers.


1216
0:52:5,94 --> 0:52:8,58
He smoked three to four
packs of cigarettes a day.


1217
0:52:8,58 --> 0:52:11,43
He ate a very high-fat diet.


1218
0:52:11,43 --> 0:52:15,0
He did everything wrong
you can imagine in a life.


1219
0:52:15,0 --> 0:52:16,55
My mother died at 53.


1220
0:52:16,55 --> 0:52:17,62
My father died at 83.


1221
0:52:17,62 --> 0:52:20,4



1222
0:52:20,4 --> 0:52:23,36
And he was healthy up until
the last couple years.


1223
0:52:23,36 --> 0:52:28,84
But he began to develop
degenerative alcohol syndrome,


1224
0:52:28,84 --> 0:52:31,63
which is the hollow
spaces in your brain


1225
0:52:31,63 --> 0:52:34,78
that are filled with fluid and
serve a purpose in your brain


1226
0:52:34,78 --> 0:52:36,98
begin to enlarge.


1227
0:52:36,98 --> 0:52:39,35
People with this begin
to lose brain tissue.


1228
0:52:39,35 --> 0:52:43,15
And my father later in life
was diagnosed as a sociopath.


1229
0:52:43,15 --> 0:52:47,755
He'd been diagnosed as a
borderline schizophrenic


1230
0:52:47,755 --> 0:52:50,82
with tendencies to violence,
complicated by alcoholism,


1231
0:52:50,82 --> 0:52:52,23
which is a very bad thing.


1232
0:52:52,23 --> 0:52:56,77
That he didn't get diagnosed
until he was in his mid


1233
0:52:56,77 --> 0:52:58,92
to late 70s.


1234
0:52:58,92 --> 0:53:3,57
Then one day a friend
of my father's called.


1235
0:53:3,57 --> 0:53:5,36
I'm a little off the
subject, but not.


1236
0:53:5,36 --> 0:53:7,146
I'll get back to it.


1237
0:53:7,146 --> 0:53:9,98
A fishing buddy of my
father's called me up.


1238
0:53:9,98 --> 0:53:11,88
We had moved to California.


1239
0:53:11,88 --> 0:53:14,29
And finally we
didn't have to worry


1240
0:53:14,29 --> 0:53:16,39
that there would be a
pounding on our door at 2:00


1241
0:53:16,39 --> 0:53:20,87
in the morning and it
would my father, drunk.


1242
0:53:20,87 --> 0:53:21,67
But we were out here
less than a year.


1243
0:53:21,67 --> 0:53:26,49
Then a friend of his called
up and said, he's destitute.


1244
0:53:26,49 --> 0:53:27,81
Which he always was.


1245
0:53:27,81 --> 0:53:29,52
And you could send
him money, and he


1246
0:53:29,52 --> 0:53:31,811
wouldn't have it the next
day, because he'd go to a bar


1247
0:53:31,811 --> 0:53:33,36
and buy drinks for everybody.


1248
0:53:33,36 --> 0:53:34,86
And he said, he's destitute.


1249
0:53:34,86 --> 0:53:37,53
And he's in terrible health.


1250
0:53:37,53 --> 0:53:39,31
He's not going to last a year.


1251
0:53:39,31 --> 0:53:42,49
So my wife and I sat down and
had to figure out what to do.


1252
0:53:42,49 --> 0:53:45,12
And it was the hardest
decision of my life,


1253
0:53:45,12 --> 0:53:46,81
but we decided we couldn't.


1254
0:53:46,81 --> 0:53:49,375
He was never there
for me and my mother.


1255
0:53:49,375 --> 0:53:52,14
And my wife was
a saint for this.


1256
0:53:52,14 --> 0:53:53,78
She knew what she
was getting into.


1257
0:53:53,78 --> 0:53:57,92
We moved him west, got him
an apartment, paid his bills.


1258
0:53:57,92 --> 0:54:0,88
But we said, this
is only for a year.


1259
0:54:0,88 --> 0:54:2,64
He lived 14 years.


1260
0:54:2,64 --> 0:54:6,99
And it was 14 very bad years.


1261
0:54:6,99 --> 0:54:10,3
But my wife dealt with
it in a fabulous way.


1262
0:54:10,3 --> 0:54:14,84
But I grew up with this
example of evil in their life.


1263
0:54:14,84 --> 0:54:17,76
I mean, my father was
a pathological liar.


1264
0:54:17,76 --> 0:54:20,53
He would lie to you
sitting across the table


1265
0:54:20,53 --> 0:54:23,4
from you, knowing
you know he's lying.


1266
0:54:23,4 --> 0:54:25,39
And he'd get this
smile on his face,


1267
0:54:25,39 --> 0:54:27,94
just to see how long
you'd put up with this.


1268
0:54:27,94 --> 0:54:29,95
And there was no reason
not to put up with it,


1269
0:54:29,95 --> 0:54:33,27
because all he'd do if you
called him on it was explode.


1270
0:54:33,27 --> 0:54:34,62
And he'd cause a scene.


1271
0:54:34,62 --> 0:54:38,42
And when we'd take him out
on Father's Day for dinner,


1272
0:54:38,42 --> 0:54:41,13
we'd go to a restaurant and
we'd be sitting across from him.


1273
0:54:41,13 --> 0:54:43,78
And he'd start
things like telling


1274
0:54:43,78 --> 0:54:45,86
Gerda about my uncle Ned.


1275
0:54:45,86 --> 0:54:48,33
Now, I don't have an uncle Ned.


1276
0:54:48,33 --> 0:54:50,91
And Gerda, the first time
this happened, she kind of


1277
0:54:50,91 --> 0:54:52,61
looked at me.


1278
0:54:52,61 --> 0:54:54,85
And she said, I didn't
know you had an uncle Ned.


1279
0:54:54,85 --> 0:54:57,11
And I though, oh, just wait.


1280
0:54:57,11 --> 0:54:59,32
My father would go into all
these stories about him.


1281
0:54:59,32 --> 0:55:1,68
And they'd be colorful stories.


1282
0:55:1,68 --> 0:55:3,846
And at some point, Gerda
would start to get it.


1283
0:55:3,846 --> 0:55:5,22
And I could see
when she'd start.


1284
0:55:5,22 --> 0:55:6,42
Oh, no.


1285
0:55:6,42 --> 0:55:7,56
None of this is true.


1286
0:55:7,56 --> 0:55:10,61
Well, when you grew up
with all that and saw it,


1287
0:55:10,61 --> 0:55:14,24
I just have an
understanding of people


1288
0:55:14,24 --> 0:55:16,98
who are that way, who'd rather
lie than tell the truth,


1289
0:55:16,98 --> 0:55:20,3
even if telling the truth
would be better for them.


1290
0:55:20,3 --> 0:55:24,2
And when he was
diagnosed as a sociopath,


1291
0:55:24,2 --> 0:55:26,22
it was after he made
an attempt on my life


1292
0:55:26,22 --> 0:55:29,52
in front of a bunch of
witnesses with a knife.


1293
0:55:29,52 --> 0:55:32,7
And you had to go into
a psychiatric ward.


1294
0:55:32,7 --> 0:55:35,54
And he later ended
up-- we got him


1295
0:55:35,54 --> 0:55:37,62
on anti-psychotic medication.


1296
0:55:37,62 --> 0:55:41,25
And they were able to take
him into a retirement home


1297
0:55:41,25 --> 0:55:43,87
setting which had
nurses, so that he would


1298
0:55:43,87 --> 0:55:46,57
get the anti-psychotics
every day.


1299
0:55:46,57 --> 0:55:47,96
And he was there a year.


1300
0:55:47,96 --> 0:55:50,71
And there was a
trouble, but he was


1301
0:55:50,71 --> 0:55:52,65
the best behaved he'd ever been.


1302
0:55:52,65 --> 0:55:56,38
But when they called me up--
the doctor in the psych ward


1303
0:55:56,38 --> 0:55:58,6
called me up after
he'd been in there.


1304
0:55:58,6 --> 0:56:3,4
And he said, are you able
to talk about your father?


1305
0:56:3,4 --> 0:56:4,65
And I said, sure.


1306
0:56:4,65 --> 0:56:7,59
And he said, would
this be painful to you.


1307
0:56:7,59 --> 0:56:9,43
And I said, not talking about.


1308
0:56:9,43 --> 0:56:11,84
Living through it was painful.


1309
0:56:11,84 --> 0:56:15,9
And he said, tell me
about your father.


1310
0:56:15,9 --> 0:56:17,2
And I said, well,
what you want me to--?


1311
0:56:17,2 --> 0:56:19,61
He said, no, let me tell you
some things about your father.


1312
0:56:19,61 --> 0:56:22,23
When you were
young, he threatened


1313
0:56:22,23 --> 0:56:23,94
to kill you and your
mother, didn't he?


1314
0:56:23,94 --> 0:56:25,7
And I said, oh
yeah, all the time.


1315
0:56:25,7 --> 0:56:28,66
And he said, and you believed he
would do that sooner or later.


1316
0:56:28,66 --> 0:56:30,43
And I said, oh yeah.


1317
0:56:30,43 --> 0:56:32,38
I'm amazed he never did.


1318
0:56:32,38 --> 0:56:35,74
And he said, your father
was never a religious man.


1319
0:56:35,74 --> 0:56:36,34
No.


1320
0:56:36,34 --> 0:56:39,19
And he said, but when things
went really bad for him,


1321
0:56:39,19 --> 0:56:42,33
he'd go buy a Bible, and he'd
sit reading it by the hour.


1322
0:56:42,33 --> 0:56:45,61
And he'd make you
read it with him.


1323
0:56:45,61 --> 0:56:48,35
It was like this man
had been in our home.


1324
0:56:48,35 --> 0:56:50,84
And he went through behavior
after behavior like this.


1325
0:56:50,84 --> 0:56:53,59
And they were all things
that my father had done.


1326
0:56:53,59 --> 0:56:56,96
And I said, you're about
to tell me something.


1327
0:56:56,96 --> 0:56:58,85
You know what my father is.


1328
0:56:58,85 --> 0:57:1,23
And I've been told he's a
borderline schizophrenic


1329
0:57:1,23 --> 0:57:4,7
with tendencies to violence,
complicated by alcoholism.


1330
0:57:4,7 --> 0:57:8,19
And he said, no, your
father is a sociopath.


1331
0:57:8,19 --> 0:57:11,61
He has no ordinary
feelings, as we,


1332
0:57:11,61 --> 0:57:13,6
but he's very good
at faking them.


1333
0:57:13,6 --> 0:57:16,16
And it was one of
the most-- it may


1334
0:57:16,16 --> 0:57:18,3
be the most amazing
moment of my life.


1335
0:57:18,3 --> 0:57:20,14
All of this stuff clicked.


1336
0:57:20,14 --> 0:57:22,27
All of the things
you wondered about,


1337
0:57:22,27 --> 0:57:24,37
you couldn't understand
why these things happened,


1338
0:57:24,37 --> 0:57:26,68
why somebody would be that way.


1339
0:57:26,68 --> 0:57:28,14
It just suddenly clicked.


1340
0:57:28,14 --> 0:57:30,65
You're living with Hannibal
Lecter, except he never


1341
0:57:30,65 --> 0:57:31,89
went that far.


1342
0:57:31,89 --> 0:57:32,97
He was always in fights.


1343
0:57:32,97 --> 0:57:35,92
He ended up in jail
a number of times.


1344
0:57:35,92 --> 0:57:38,27
And he was very violent.


1345
0:57:38,27 --> 0:57:40,43
But it never went
that extra step.


1346
0:57:40,43 --> 0:57:44,21
And so we were very fortunate.


1347
0:57:44,21 --> 0:57:48,3
But that's where I have this
affinity, which people tell me


1348
0:57:48,3 --> 0:57:51,88
I do, to write really
bad, bad characters.


1349
0:57:51,88 --> 0:57:53,55
And I do research on that, too.


1350
0:57:53,55 --> 0:57:55,95
The character and the
intensity is actually


1351
0:57:55,95 --> 0:57:59,2
based on a genuine
serial killer.


1352
0:57:59,2 --> 0:58:0,89
And I had to tame it down.


1353
0:58:0,89 --> 0:58:3,87
Because if I had written
what this guy really did,


1354
0:58:3,87 --> 0:58:6,11
nobody would want
to read about it.


1355
0:58:6,11 --> 0:58:11,12
So it's life experience,
but also research again.


1356
0:58:11,12 --> 0:58:12,59
So did that answer
your question?


1357
0:58:12,59 --> 0:58:14,881
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's interesting
because the worse that


1358
0:58:14,881 --> 0:58:17,486
character does, the stronger
he gets, presumably.


1359
0:58:17,486 --> 0:58:18,36
He perceives himself.


1360
0:58:18,36 --> 0:58:18,83
We don't know.


1361
0:58:18,83 --> 0:58:21,33
You write it in such a way where
you don't know if he's just


1362
0:58:21,33 --> 0:58:23,96
crazy, or he's got some
supernatural ability to absorb


1363
0:58:23,96 --> 0:58:24,602
people's--


1364
0:58:24,602 --> 0:58:26,56
DEAN KOONTZ: I'm trying
to lead you along that.


1365
0:58:26,56 --> 0:58:27,17
But he's not.


1366
0:58:27,17 --> 0:58:29,222
He just thinks
he's supernatural.


1367
0:58:29,222 --> 0:58:31,18
AUDIENCE: But you could
interpret it both ways.


1368
0:58:31,18 --> 0:58:34,36
But I always thought it was
just him being a psychopath.


1369
0:58:34,36 --> 0:58:39,0
And the worse I do, the
more innocent the victim,


1370
0:58:39,0 --> 0:58:40,501
the stronger I get.


1371
0:58:40,501 --> 0:58:42,75
DEAN KOONTZ: I'll tell you
one funny thing about that.


1372
0:58:42,75 --> 0:58:46,26
Well, I think it's funny.


1373
0:58:46,26 --> 0:58:48,42
He's a particularly
nasty character.


1374
0:58:48,42 --> 0:58:52,25
And there's a point in the book
where he kills a scientist.


1375
0:58:52,25 --> 0:58:55,12
He's assigned to kill
these people who's


1376
0:58:55,12 --> 0:58:56,39
been involved in this.


1377
0:58:56,39 --> 0:59:1,16
And he kills this woman
scientist with a hammer.


1378
0:59:1,16 --> 0:59:3,24
And I do not write gore.


1379
0:59:3,24 --> 0:59:3,88
I just don't.


1380
0:59:3,88 --> 0:59:5,96
I never have.


1381
0:59:5,96 --> 0:59:9,89
And I would have people come
up in book signings to me


1382
0:59:9,89 --> 0:59:10,38
and say, oh, I love your books.


1383
0:59:10,38 --> 0:59:12,68
But when it gets
to the gory scenes,


1384
0:59:12,68 --> 0:59:14,7
sometimes I just I can't.


1385
0:59:14,7 --> 0:59:17,65
And I'd say, the gory scenes?


1386
0:59:17,65 --> 0:59:18,34
Tell me one.


1387
0:59:18,34 --> 0:59:19,98
I heard this awhile.


1388
0:59:19,98 --> 0:59:25,11
And often, when I would
start to ask where,


1389
0:59:25,11 --> 0:59:26,92
I found out it was
the same scene, often.


1390
0:59:26,92 --> 0:59:30,6
And it was this hammer
scene in "Watchers."


1391
0:59:30,6 --> 0:59:34,75
And I'd say to them, how
long do you think that is?


1392
0:59:34,75 --> 0:59:38,37
How long is it from the
moment he picks up the hammer


1393
0:59:38,37 --> 0:59:39,68
until she's dead.


1394
0:59:39,68 --> 0:59:40,41
How many words?


1395
0:59:40,41 --> 0:59:41,43
How many paragraphs?


1396
0:59:41,43 --> 0:59:44,22
And the answer would
always be, oh, it's


1397
0:59:44,22 --> 0:59:46,79
like two or four pages,
or something like that.


1398
0:59:46,79 --> 0:59:49,784
And I said, no, he tells
her what he's going to do.


1399
0:59:49,784 --> 0:59:51,45
And then he undresses
because he doesn't


1400
0:59:51,45 --> 0:59:53,8
want to get blood
on his clothes.


1401
0:59:53,8 --> 0:59:55,21
And we know he's crazy.


1402
0:59:55,21 --> 0:59:59,51
But from the moment he picks up
hammer until he's killed her,


1403
0:59:59,51 --> 1:0:4,26
it says, "The first
blow struck her kneecap.


1404
1:0:4,26 --> 1:0:6,27
80 blows later, she dead."


1405
1:0:6,27 --> 1:0:7,38
That's all.


1406
1:0:7,38 --> 1:0:11,8
But in your mind, you're
seeing the other 80 blows


1407
1:0:11,8 --> 1:0:13,32
to some extent, that's
how the mind works.


1408
1:0:13,32 --> 1:0:14,53
You imagine it.


1409
1:0:14,53 --> 1:0:16,66
And so you don't
have to do the gore.


1410
1:0:16,66 --> 1:0:18,9
You just have to set
the situation up and let


1411
1:0:18,9 --> 1:0:20,85
the imagination of
the reader take it.


1412
1:0:20,85 --> 1:0:22,84
But it's interesting
you brought that up,


1413
1:0:22,84 --> 1:0:25,59
because that's the
one that often people


1414
1:0:25,59 --> 1:0:28,41
find that just too chilling.


1415
1:0:28,41 --> 1:0:31,72
AUDIENCE: It's a chilling
book, but if you are dog lover,


1416
1:0:31,72 --> 1:0:35,12
it's something very special
about friendship and connection


1417
1:0:35,12 --> 1:0:37,319
to an animal or to,
particularly, dogs.


1418
1:0:37,319 --> 1:0:39,86
That's why I connect with it so
much, because I love animals.


1419
1:0:39,86 --> 1:0:41,55
I love animals and dogs.


1420
1:0:41,55 --> 1:0:43,8
DEAN KOONTZ: The book is
ultimately about love,


1421
1:0:43,8 --> 1:0:47,53
and love for each other
and for the animals.


1422
1:0:47,53 --> 1:0:50,9
You have to go through hell
to get to the love part.


1423
1:0:50,9 --> 1:0:52,73
AUDIENCE: I just wanted to
give the golden retrievers


1424
1:0:52,73 --> 1:0:54,362
a shout out for that.


1425
1:0:54,362 --> 1:0:55,32
DEAN KOONTZ: Thank you.


1426
1:0:55,32 --> 1:0:56,31
You were great.


1427
1:0:56,31 --> 1:2:56,31
[APPLAUSE]
