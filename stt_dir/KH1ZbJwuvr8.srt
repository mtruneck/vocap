2
0:0:12,275 --> 0:0:14,54
VALERIE VARGAS: I didn't like
being different at school.


3
0:0:14,54 --> 0:0:17,47
I don't think any kid really,
actually fully enjoys being


4
0:0:17,47 --> 0:0:21,11
different at school.


5
0:0:21,11 --> 0:0:24,763
I've got a really old drawing
that I did of my mom when I


6
0:0:24,763 --> 0:0:25,82
was like 10 or 11.


7
0:0:25,82 --> 0:0:27,68
That's pretty cool.


8
0:0:27,68 --> 0:0:29,48
Where the fuck did I put it?


9
0:0:29,48 --> 0:0:30,73
I hope I didn't put it away.


10
0:0:30,73 --> 0:0:34,57



11
0:0:34,57 --> 0:0:36,72
That's my mom.


12
0:0:36,72 --> 0:0:39,8
I do remember just copying
things very early on, from age


13
0:0:39,8 --> 0:0:41,74
three or four, and my mom was
always putting it up on the


14
0:0:41,74 --> 0:0:43,9
fridge and stuff.


15
0:0:43,9 --> 0:0:45,55
It just always kind of made me
really happy and really proud


16
0:0:45,55 --> 0:0:47,5
that she liked what I did.


17
0:0:47,5 --> 0:0:49,52
That sounds really sad, but I
didn't really like playing.


18
0:0:49,52 --> 0:0:50,85
I just really liked drawing.


19
0:0:50,85 --> 0:0:54,44
So, to join in, she would draw
with me, and whenever she drew


20
0:0:54,44 --> 0:0:56,12
with me, if she drew girls--


21
0:0:56,12 --> 0:0:59,11
I only found out after getting
into tattoing that the way she


22
0:0:59,11 --> 0:1:1,51
draws girls are very much
like Jerry pin-ups.


23
0:1:1,51 --> 0:1:4,26
Because tattooing designs in
general, in magazines and that


24
0:1:4,26 --> 0:1:7,58
stuff, so it's pretty cool that,
if she was asked to draw


25
0:1:7,58 --> 0:1:9,41
a girl, she'd just
draw a pin-up.


26
0:1:9,41 --> 0:1:10,94
And then, yeah, that
just carried on.


27
0:1:10,94 --> 0:1:13,1
And, we never really
thought I was ever


28
0:1:13,1 --> 0:1:13,94
gonna do anything else.


29
0:1:13,94 --> 0:1:15,854
There was never a
question of it.


30
0:1:15,854 --> 0:1:18,33
And tattooing found
me, thankfully.


31
0:1:18,33 --> 0:1:21,364
And, this is the way now.


32
0:1:21,364 --> 0:1:42,238
[MUSIC PLAYING]


33
0:1:42,238 --> 0:1:44,1
STEWART ROBSON: There's kind
of different elements to


34
0:1:44,1 --> 0:1:45,11
Valerie's style.


35
0:1:45,11 --> 0:1:46,76
There's that kind
of fantasy side.


36
0:1:46,76 --> 0:1:49,396
But then, there's the more
tattoo-ey side, the way she


37
0:1:49,396 --> 0:1:54,89
can just do a really pretty
version of some old flash.


38
0:1:54,89 --> 0:1:56,5
She's careful of doing something
really cute, or


39
0:1:56,5 --> 0:1:58,65
something really tough, or
something really beautiful, or


40
0:1:58,65 --> 0:2:0,275
something--


41
0:2:0,275 --> 0:2:4,57
she never does anything ugly,
but, she can make a witch look


42
0:2:4,57 --> 0:2:5,83
cool, or a demon look cool.


43
0:2:5,83 --> 0:2:7,175
But it's still beautiful.


44
0:2:7,175 --> 0:2:9,66
VALERIE VARGAS: Personally,
I like to base it on


45
0:2:9,66 --> 0:2:10,27
traditional.


46
0:2:10,27 --> 0:2:11,8
I do enjoy putting a
little bit of extra


47
0:2:11,8 --> 0:2:12,98
detail here and there.


48
0:2:12,98 --> 0:2:16,27
Bold lines, lots of black
shading, bright colors.


49
0:2:16,27 --> 0:2:17,53
I really enjoy doing
bright colors.


50
0:2:17,53 --> 0:2:19,64
I'm not a fan of it when people
say, oh, can you make


51
0:2:19,64 --> 0:2:20,1
it look old.


52
0:2:20,1 --> 0:2:23,995
I'm like, the brighter
the better.


53
0:2:23,995 --> 0:2:26,41
STEFANO C.: She's a very
good illustrator.


54
0:2:26,41 --> 0:2:28,21
She knows how to put it down.


55
0:2:28,21 --> 0:2:33,9
She ended up with her drawing
skills to create what she got


56
0:2:33,9 --> 0:2:35,39
at the moment, which is
something pretty unique.


57
0:2:35,39 --> 0:2:39,382



58
0:2:39,382 --> 0:2:41,51
VALERIE VARGAS: Could
you hold this?


59
0:2:41,51 --> 0:2:45,295
Trying to close the
both and I can't.


60
0:2:45,295 --> 0:2:47,755
OK, I'll close that one
if you hold this.


61
0:2:47,755 --> 0:2:54,65



62
0:2:54,65 --> 0:2:57,32
My name is Valerie Vargas, and
I tattoo at Frith Street.


63
0:2:57,32 --> 0:3:1,22



64
0:3:1,22 --> 0:3:4,13
It's a little tiny shop
in a basement in


65
0:3:4,13 --> 0:3:5,37
the middle of Soho.


66
0:3:5,37 --> 0:3:7,4
It's a really nice team
we have, I think.


67
0:3:7,4 --> 0:3:9,15
We all really enjoy each
other's companies.


68
0:3:9,15 --> 0:3:10,35
We're good friends.


69
0:3:10,35 --> 0:3:12,52
And we all respect each
other's work.


70
0:3:12,52 --> 0:3:16,894



71
0:3:16,894 --> 0:3:20,1
DANTE DIMASSA: I want to say
we're a street shop.


72
0:3:20,1 --> 0:3:26,15
This was the idea behind having
the shop the way it is.


73
0:3:26,15 --> 0:3:28,7
But we're not a street shop.


74
0:3:28,7 --> 0:3:29,59
We do a lot of big work.


75
0:3:29,59 --> 0:3:30,92
We do a lot of custom stuff.


76
0:3:30,92 --> 0:3:32,47
The majority of the
stuff is custom.


77
0:3:32,47 --> 0:3:35,69
I can't remember the last time
we've tattooed something


78
0:3:35,69 --> 0:3:38,81
straight out of a flashbook
or whatever.


79
0:3:38,81 --> 0:3:40,75
I think we tend to more--


80
0:3:40,75 --> 0:3:43,86
it's not our scene, but we
tend to a lot of the--


81
0:3:43,86 --> 0:3:46,96



82
0:3:46,96 --> 0:3:48,93
we tend to a lot of kids.


83
0:3:48,93 --> 0:3:50,33
Yeah, show him your front.


84
0:3:50,33 --> 0:3:51,58
Don't be gay.


85
0:3:51,58 --> 0:3:54,6



86
0:3:54,6 --> 0:3:57,24
It's the shop that people want
and come and get not


87
0:3:57,24 --> 0:3:59,53
necessarily a particular tattoo,
but they get a tattoo


88
0:3:59,53 --> 0:4:0,78
that's theirs.


89
0:4:0,78 --> 0:4:5,61



90
0:4:5,61 --> 0:4:10,1
How old were you when you came
and worked at the shop?


91
0:4:10,1 --> 0:4:10,51
24?


92
0:4:10,51 --> 0:4:10,81
25?


93
0:4:10,81 --> 0:4:11,49
VALERIE VARGAS: No, no.


94
0:4:11,49 --> 0:4:12,205
DANTE DIMASSA: Younger?


95
0:4:12,205 --> 0:4:12,54
Older?


96
0:4:12,54 --> 0:4:14,37
VALERIE VARGAS: Well, I've
been here five years in


97
0:4:14,37 --> 0:4:16,89
August, so, 25?


98
0:4:16,89 --> 0:4:17,342
26?


99
0:4:17,342 --> 0:4:18,7
25, 26?


100
0:4:18,7 --> 0:4:20,539
Yeah, you were only
but a young spring


101
0:4:20,539 --> 0:4:23,796
chicken when I met you.


102
0:4:23,796 --> 0:4:26,83
DANTE DIMASSA: Valerie kind of
came with Stewart, really.


103
0:4:26,83 --> 0:4:31,7
The person who got the job
offer was Stewart.


104
0:4:31,7 --> 0:4:35,53
I hadn't planned on giving
Valerie a job, but we knew


105
0:4:35,53 --> 0:4:37,35
that she had a lot of promise.


106
0:4:37,35 --> 0:4:41,95
I had always said to myself,
I wasn't gonna employ a


107
0:4:41,95 --> 0:4:46,97
boyfriend-girlfriend scenario
here, but it seemed the


108
0:4:46,97 --> 0:4:50,725
natural choice to get Valerie.


109
0:4:50,725 --> 0:4:53,675
VALERIE VARGAS: We try and make
sure that the grievance


110
0:4:53,675 --> 0:4:55,3
is dealt with before
we get to work.


111
0:4:55,3 --> 0:5:0,23



112
0:5:0,23 --> 0:5:2,22
Yeah, that's fucking rubbish
to work with, you know.


113
0:5:2,22 --> 0:5:3,86
I mean that's probably the
reason why Danny almost didn't


114
0:5:3,86 --> 0:5:6,75
give us a job together because
he had at one point.


115
0:5:6,75 --> 0:5:9,13
Nobody can stand our company
by each other, so I think


116
0:5:9,13 --> 0:5:10,63
that's the only reason
we work out.


117
0:5:10,63 --> 0:5:17,78



118
0:5:17,78 --> 0:5:20,26
I tattoo next to Stewart
Robson, of course.


119
0:5:20,26 --> 0:5:20,88
Always.


120
0:5:20,88 --> 0:5:23,73
We seem to be a bit of a
kind of double deal.


121
0:5:23,73 --> 0:5:25,22
Like if you're gonna have me,
you're gonna have to have him,


122
0:5:25,22 --> 0:5:26,31
and so forth.


123
0:5:26,31 --> 0:5:30,89
And we really do enjoy talking
over work, and like if I'm


124
0:5:30,89 --> 0:5:33,4
tattooing, he's tattooing, we'll
shout over at each other


125
0:5:33,4 --> 0:5:34,74
or talk to each other's
customers, so.


126
0:5:34,74 --> 0:5:35,885
I really enjoy working
next to him.


127
0:5:35,885 --> 0:5:37,46
STEWART ROBSON: Sometimes she
gets a little annoying.


128
0:5:37,46 --> 0:5:39,686
It's like having your own
conscience in front of you.


129
0:5:39,686 --> 0:5:41,14
And you can't just ignore it.


130
0:5:41,14 --> 0:5:43,559
It's there, going, come on,
you need to do this.


131
0:5:43,559 --> 0:5:45,18
VALERIE VARGAS: Are you
doing any shading in


132
0:5:45,18 --> 0:5:47,476
the curly bits, or?


133
0:5:47,476 --> 0:5:48,35
STEWART ROBSON: I'm not sure.


134
0:5:48,35 --> 0:5:49,19
VALERIE VARGAS: Like
as a black and gray


135
0:5:49,19 --> 0:5:50,2
shading, or color, or?


136
0:5:50,2 --> 0:5:52,62
STEWART ROBSON: There's some
sort of there, so I might just


137
0:5:52,62 --> 0:5:53,7
leave that one.


138
0:5:53,7 --> 0:5:54,67
VALERIE VARGAS: I think you
should a full Indian disco


139
0:5:54,67 --> 0:5:55,92
ball cut-out.


140
0:5:55,92 --> 0:6:1,771



141
0:6:1,771 --> 0:6:3,101
I don't think she's
coming back after


142
0:6:3,101 --> 0:6:5,685
this once you do it.


143
0:6:5,685 --> 0:6:7,2
STEWART ROBSON: But I was
always impressed by her


144
0:6:7,2 --> 0:6:8,35
drawing skills.


145
0:6:8,35 --> 0:6:10,53
She's always so good
at drawing.


146
0:6:10,53 --> 0:6:11,49
Particularly figurative stuff.


147
0:6:11,49 --> 0:6:14,79
The shape of a female body,
and the way that all the


148
0:6:14,79 --> 0:6:16,95
joints fit together.


149
0:6:16,95 --> 0:6:18,2
It was impressive.


150
0:6:18,2 --> 0:6:20,398



151
0:6:20,398 --> 0:6:22,3
VALERIE VARGAS: All
right, here.


152
0:6:22,3 --> 0:6:26,2
Just got one more rose to do.


153
0:6:26,2 --> 0:6:27,27
And then we'll be done today.


154
0:6:27,27 --> 0:6:31,325



155
0:6:31,325 --> 0:6:32,99
DANTE DIMASSA: I don't wanna
say Valerie does our


156
0:6:32,99 --> 0:6:35,28
traditional tattooing, because
it's far from being


157
0:6:35,28 --> 0:6:36,14
traditional.


158
0:6:36,14 --> 0:6:38,14
Nonetheless, the
idea, the way--


159
0:6:38,14 --> 0:6:42,492
I suppose the execution
is very traditional.


160
0:6:42,492 --> 0:6:43,805
VALERIE VARGAS: I think
you deserve a


161
0:6:43,805 --> 0:6:45,55
pint of some chocolate.


162
0:6:45,55 --> 0:6:48,382



163
0:6:48,382 --> 0:6:50,98
DANTE DIMASSA: The designs that
Valerie does are still


164
0:6:50,98 --> 0:6:55,49
rooted in with good, solid,
long-lasting tattooes.


165
0:6:55,49 --> 0:6:58,81
She makes it work
very, very well.


166
0:6:58,81 --> 0:7:1,99
She's just done a back piece,
a Rock of Ages back piece.


167
0:7:1,99 --> 0:7:2,95
I really liked that tattoo.


168
0:7:2,95 --> 0:7:4,77
I'd be proud to have that.


169
0:7:4,77 --> 0:7:7,67
I like the lack of space,
do you know what I mean?


170
0:7:7,67 --> 0:7:9,25
I like the lack of space.


171
0:7:9,25 --> 0:7:12,87
When you look at it, it looks
like it's breathing at you.


172
0:7:12,87 --> 0:7:14,88
I don't think she would want
to say, my style is


173
0:7:14,88 --> 0:7:16,29
traditional, or my style is--


174
0:7:16,29 --> 0:7:19,98
I think her style is a mix of
many styles put together.


175
0:7:19,98 --> 0:7:26,27
Jack Rudy, Scott Sylvia,
Tim Lehi, Chris Conn.


176
0:7:26,27 --> 0:7:29,335
She's taken everything
from those people and


177
0:7:29,335 --> 0:7:30,6
made things her own.


178
0:7:30,6 --> 0:7:38,99



179
0:7:38,99 --> 0:7:40,6
VALERIE VARGAS: I started
tattooing right after Chris


180
0:7:40,6 --> 0:7:42,38
Conn pretty much
quit tattooing.


181
0:7:42,38 --> 0:7:45,17
I had seen a couple of his
tattoos in older magazines.


182
0:7:45,17 --> 0:7:48,7
I didn't connect his name, so
I wasn't really aware that


183
0:7:48,7 --> 0:7:50,3
this guy had been doing all
these paintings that I really


184
0:7:50,3 --> 0:7:50,82
liked as well.


185
0:7:50,82 --> 0:7:52,9
And then when it all clicked in
my head, I was like, oh, my


186
0:7:52,9 --> 0:7:54,83
god, this is amazing,
you know.


187
0:7:54,83 --> 0:7:56,31
And can I get tattooed by him?


188
0:7:56,31 --> 0:7:57,38
Oh, no, I can't.


189
0:7:57,38 --> 0:7:58,29
Never mind.


190
0:7:58,29 --> 0:8:0,29
I collected quite a few
of these prints.


191
0:8:0,29 --> 0:8:2,67
I've got the one that he
did for Revisited.


192
0:8:2,67 --> 0:8:4,0
With all the girl
heads and stuff.


193
0:8:4,0 --> 0:8:7,59
And I'm sure any tattooer worthy
soul has that somewhere


194
0:8:7,59 --> 0:8:10,46
and references heavily.


195
0:8:10,46 --> 0:8:13,25
And even though I've always
enjoyed doing girl heads, it


196
0:8:13,25 --> 0:8:16,5
was that print that I really
got it drummed into my head


197
0:8:16,5 --> 0:8:19,21
what makes a successful
tattooed lady head.


198
0:8:19,21 --> 0:8:20,97
All the little tricks and
everything, and I just took


199
0:8:20,97 --> 0:8:24,635
that and ran away with it, and
had my own style emerge.


200
0:8:24,635 --> 0:8:25,89
I'd like to think anyway.


201
0:8:25,89 --> 0:8:29,38



202
0:8:29,38 --> 0:8:30,64
Ooh.


203
0:8:30,64 --> 0:8:31,89
Voicemail.


204
0:8:31,89 --> 0:8:33,809



205
0:8:33,809 --> 0:8:35,99
Hello?


206
0:8:35,99 --> 0:8:37,24
Hey, so what's going on?


207
0:8:37,24 --> 0:8:42,1



208
0:8:42,1 --> 0:8:43,52
Yeah.


209
0:8:43,52 --> 0:8:44,77
Yep.


210
0:8:44,77 --> 0:8:47,25



211
0:8:47,25 --> 0:8:47,97
That's OK.


212
0:8:47,97 --> 0:8:49,306
I can do that.


213
0:8:49,306 --> 0:8:55,138



214
0:8:55,138 --> 0:8:57,53
I honestly don't get tired
of doing girl heads.


215
0:8:57,53 --> 0:8:59,38
People always ask me but--


216
0:8:59,38 --> 0:9:0,6
I love it.


217
0:9:0,6 --> 0:9:3,225
STEFANO C.: There was a time,
like a couple of years ago


218
0:9:3,225 --> 0:9:6,1
that she was doing lots of
girls, doing everything.


219
0:9:6,1 --> 0:9:9,5
Like doing like the hand holding
something, doing


220
0:9:9,5 --> 0:9:11,255
something, lots of
face expressions.


221
0:9:11,255 --> 0:9:12,62
VALERIE VARGAS: I did these
two on the back


222
0:9:12,62 --> 0:9:14,73
of calves on a girl.


223
0:9:14,73 --> 0:9:15,54
I didn't do this one.


224
0:9:15,54 --> 0:9:16,9
She didn't like that one because
she thought it was too


225
0:9:16,9 --> 0:9:18,89
much like this one, so I did
a different one, with more


226
0:9:18,89 --> 0:9:20,92
jewelry and different hairstyle
and slightly


227
0:9:20,92 --> 0:9:22,29
different facing.


228
0:9:22,29 --> 0:9:23,47
Again, they're the
bane of my life.


229
0:9:23,47 --> 0:9:25,63
I get so many people wanting
exactly those guys.


230
0:9:25,63 --> 0:9:27,93
It's like, you can't have
exactly the same thing.


231
0:9:27,93 --> 0:9:30,844
That's not how it works.


232
0:9:30,844 --> 0:9:35,67
STEWART ROBSON: It's awesome
to see someone just grab a


233
0:9:35,67 --> 0:9:39,82
style and wrestle with it and
twist it and turn it into


234
0:9:39,82 --> 0:9:41,77
something else.


235
0:9:41,77 --> 0:9:44,16
The thing that maybe sets her
apart from the Chris Conn


236
0:9:44,16 --> 0:9:48,17
school of tattooing is
each one of the faces


237
0:9:48,17 --> 0:9:50,86
she draws is different.


238
0:9:50,86 --> 0:9:53,16
Because there's a different
mood, and she's really--


239
0:9:53,16 --> 0:9:56,24
I think that came from her
animation schooling and her


240
0:9:56,24 --> 0:9:58,18
love of animation.


241
0:9:58,18 --> 0:10:2,25
She'll watch all Disney
animations endlessly.


242
0:10:2,25 --> 0:10:5,822
She'll watch Robin Hood again
and I can't stand it.


243
0:10:5,822 --> 0:10:8,62
VALERIE VARGAS: At art school,
I was studying animation.


244
0:10:8,62 --> 0:10:11,6
And it was weird, because I
always felt like the art kid


245
0:10:11,6 --> 0:10:13,94
and then I moved to Dundee to
study art, and then obviously,


246
0:10:13,94 --> 0:10:15,635
you're not the art
kid anymore.


247
0:10:15,635 --> 0:10:17,6
You're just one of
the art kids.


248
0:10:17,6 --> 0:10:22,73



249
0:10:22,73 --> 0:10:23,75
I wanted to do 2D.


250
0:10:23,75 --> 0:10:27,2
I've always enjoyed drawing and
right at the time I was


251
0:10:27,2 --> 0:10:29,78
learning and I was in that
course, 3D started.


252
0:10:29,78 --> 0:10:32,56
Toy Story had just come out
like the year before,


253
0:10:32,56 --> 0:10:33,43
and that was it.


254
0:10:33,43 --> 0:10:34,69
That was the beginning
of the end.


255
0:10:34,69 --> 0:10:38,27
And to actually use a computer
as your primary source of


256
0:10:38,27 --> 0:10:39,22
creativity--


257
0:10:39,22 --> 0:10:41,61
ugh, no, not for me.


258
0:10:41,61 --> 0:10:44,15
I want to get stuck into
something and physically be in


259
0:10:44,15 --> 0:10:46,41
charge of it and not having to
do it through another medium


260
0:10:46,41 --> 0:10:47,655
which, again for me--


261
0:10:47,655 --> 0:10:48,905
tattooing is just perfect.


262
0:10:48,905 --> 0:10:56,22



263
0:10:56,22 --> 0:10:58,5
You will sit here, and I will
cause you pain, and you will


264
0:10:58,5 --> 0:10:59,1
pay me for it.


265
0:10:59,1 --> 0:10:59,7
SPEAKER 1: OK.


266
0:10:59,7 --> 0:11:0,95
And I'll be thankful for it.


267
0:11:0,95 --> 0:13:0,95
