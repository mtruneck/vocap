(Children shouting)


2
0:0:37,94 --> 0:0:45,78
ñ Are you all right?
ñ No, I'm fine, yeah.


3
0:0:45,78 --> 0:0:56,18
(# Menacing music)


4
0:0:56,18 --> 0:1:1,74
Hello, Mrs... er...


5
0:1:1,74 --> 0:1:5,2
Certainly, Headmaster.


6
0:1:5,2 --> 0:1:8,78
Er, how are the erm?


7
0:1:8,78 --> 0:1:18,54
ñ Oh, they're fine.
ñ Good. Good.


8
0:1:18,54 --> 0:1:22,22
ñ (Raucous chanting) lñañan!
ñ lañañn!


9
0:1:22,22 --> 0:1:25,74
Here, lan, what's brown and hard
and doesn't make sense?


10
0:1:25,74 --> 0:1:27,82
Er, I don't know.


11
0:1:27,82 --> 0:1:30,3
(Gibberish) Tough shit.


12
0:1:30,3 --> 0:1:33,5
It was in the bog.


13
0:1:33,5 --> 0:1:35,26
ñ (Door opens)
ñ Sis!


14
0:1:35,26 --> 0:1:37,9
ñ Hi. Don't lift me up.
ñ I'm not gonna lift you up.


15
0:1:37,9 --> 0:1:40,3
ñ Can you change that for me?
ñ Yeah, no problem.


16
0:1:40,3 --> 0:1:42,34
Supergiñiñirl!


17
0:1:42,34 --> 0:1:45,1
ñ Just two fives is lovely.
ñ She used to love that.


18
0:1:45,1 --> 0:1:48,86
You're a star. Thank you. Hi, lan.
You always seem to be in here.


19
0:1:48,86 --> 0:1:51,54
It's nice to be where
everybody knows your name.


20
0:1:51,54 --> 0:1:53,38
There you go, Steve.


21
0:1:53,38 --> 0:1:55,86
ñ That's a joke between him and himself.
ñ Yes.


22
0:1:55,86 --> 0:1:59,26
I have noticed,
when talking with the children,


23
0:1:59,26 --> 0:2:3,46
they've started referring to you
as, erm, Lisa.


24
0:2:3,46 --> 0:2:8,18
Rather than Miss
or, indeed, er, Mrs... Lyons.


25
0:2:8,18 --> 0:2:12,2
Yeah. Honor, Derek and I decided
to change it a couple of months ago.


26
0:2:12,2 --> 0:2:15,74
ñ The children seem to prefer it.
ñ Yes. I'd like the practice to stop.


27
0:2:15,74 --> 0:2:17,94
Oh, why?


28
0:2:17,94 --> 0:2:21,98
For the same reason I don't want
my chiropodist calling me by my first name.


29
0:2:21,98 --> 0:2:24,74
Is it helpful to compare
the person who does your feet


30
0:2:24,74 --> 0:2:27,66
with an eightñyearñold
whose trust you're trying to earn?


31
0:2:27,66 --> 0:2:31,38
Yes, I'd like the practice to stop.


32
0:2:31,38 --> 0:2:33,42
Thank you.


33
0:2:33,42 --> 0:2:36,34
And the... school governors
are about to meet


34
0:2:36,34 --> 0:2:39,9
and I'd like to confirm your husband's
appointment to their number.


35
0:2:39,9 --> 0:2:42,58
Yes, I don't think he is the best choice.


36
0:2:42,58 --> 0:2:44,82
He's a fresh face in the village.


37
0:2:44,82 --> 0:2:47,26
It isn't really that, though, is it?


38
0:2:47,26 --> 0:2:50,14
It's no secret that
I admire his stance on discipline.


39
0:2:50,14 --> 0:2:53,86
He smacked a difficult child
he was photographing, which he regrets.


40
0:2:53,86 --> 0:2:57,9
Well, I... I've sent him a letter.
I just thought you should know.


41
0:2:57,9 --> 0:3:1,2
ñ So is that the criteria?
ñ "On".


42
0:3:1,2 --> 0:3:2,74
Criterion.


43
0:3:2,74 --> 0:3:6,22
Is that the criterion now? You whack
a child and become a governor?


44
0:3:6,22 --> 0:3:8,58
I don't think you know lan very well if...


45
0:3:8,58 --> 0:3:13,42
ñ (Pencil sharpening)
ñ Never mind.


46
0:3:13,42 --> 0:3:15,46
D'you think I'll get a chain of office?


47
0:3:15,46 --> 0:3:18,46
Or a special little black car
with little black windows?


48
0:3:18,46 --> 0:3:20,22
No.


49
0:3:20,22 --> 0:3:22,26
Will people have to call me "Governor"?


50
0:3:22,26 --> 0:3:26,3
In the chemist, "Good afternoon,
Governor lan, here's your Preparation H."


51
0:3:26,3 --> 0:3:30,34
It's not that much of an honour.
They have trouble finding anyone at all.


52
0:3:30,34 --> 0:3:34,3
I wouldn't be surprised
if they'd already asked about 88 people.


53
0:3:34,3 --> 0:3:37,74
ñ Oh, really?
ñ What d'you mean, "Oh, really?"?


54
0:3:37,74 --> 0:3:40,3
I'm getting just a whiff of... jealousy here.


55
0:3:40,3 --> 0:3:42,38
(Chuckling) I'm not jealous.


56
0:3:42,38 --> 0:3:45,3
It's because, effectively,
now I'm your boss, isn't it?


57
0:3:45,3 --> 0:3:47,98
ñ No, you're not.
ñ First thing I'm gonna do


58
0:3:47,98 --> 0:3:53,54
is make all the lady teachers wear
seeñthrough, short, leather skirts.


59
0:3:53,54 --> 0:3:57,7
So I can see their pants. Then they'll
all have to straddle me, one by one.


60
0:3:57,7 --> 0:4:0,74
ñ You're drinking too much.
ñ What else is there to do here?


61
0:4:0,74 --> 0:4:4,7
ñ Apart from hoe.
ñ Mm... nothing.


62
0:4:4,7 --> 0:4:9,54
ñ "Nothing, Governor."
ñ Shh! Nothing, Governor.


63
0:4:9,54 --> 0:4:14,18
No, it's a serious job.
I'll take it seriously.


64
0:4:14,18 --> 0:4:18,98
You may get up now.
The governor can't feel his left leg.


65
0:4:18,98 --> 0:4:23,26
So, that's agreed. We shall advertise
for a new dinner lady,


66
0:4:23,26 --> 0:4:27,46
but this time we'll specify
someone with a cooking background.


67
0:4:27,46 --> 0:4:30,18
ñ Mm.
ñ Yes? Agreed on that? Good. Thank you.


68
0:4:30,18 --> 0:4:33,82
I always think they should be called
school lunch ladies, don't you?


69
0:4:33,82 --> 0:4:35,82
ñ Hm?
ñ Although, nowadays,


70
0:4:35,82 --> 0:4:39,14
school lunch persons would
be considered more appropriate.


71
0:4:39,14 --> 0:4:44,62
ñ Hm! PC... PC...
ñ (Laughing)


72
0:4:44,62 --> 0:4:47,22
Apologies. Turkey business.


73
0:4:47,22 --> 0:4:49,46
Mr Lyons, this is Mr Yardley,


74
0:4:49,46 --> 0:4:53,66
who's been an honorary governor
for some... 30 years.


75
0:4:53,66 --> 0:4:56,7
I know. He's my fatherñinñlaw.


76
0:4:56,7 --> 0:4:59,42
Of course. One occasionally forgets


77
0:4:59,42 --> 0:5:6,26
that everyone in this village is related.


78
0:5:6,26 --> 0:5:9,42
Oh... (Clears throat)


79
0:5:9,42 --> 0:5:13,5
The, er, west wall short corridor


80
0:5:13,5 --> 0:5:15,54
is still extremely damp.


81
0:5:15,54 --> 0:5:18,9
Bringing a rather nasty fungus,
from all accounts,


82
0:5:18,9 --> 0:5:23,14
ñ which children are starting to pick at.
ñ Indeed.


83
0:5:23,14 --> 0:5:26,74
ñ I'll get some of my men to fix it.
ñ Thank you, Mr Yardley.


84
0:5:26,74 --> 0:5:30,58
ñ Isn't that a false economy?
ñ What?


85
0:5:30,58 --> 0:5:35,18
The local education authority will never
fund a realistic maintenance programme


86
0:5:35,18 --> 0:5:40,42
if the school's being repaired ad hoc
outside the budget.


87
0:5:40,42 --> 0:5:45,42
You are obviously not familiar with the concept
of a community looking after itself.


88
0:5:45,42 --> 0:5:51,42
No, I am. It's just that, surely help like this
from Snowle's major fowl tsar


89
0:5:51,42 --> 0:5:54,78
would be better spent on projects
that the authority won't fund.


90
0:5:54,78 --> 0:5:57,7
I think you've got a point there, Mr Lyons.


91
0:5:57,7 --> 0:6:3,6
Yes, instead... instead, Mr Yardley,
perhaps you could contribute help in kind


92
0:6:3,6 --> 0:6:8,82
to the Millennium millpond.


93
0:6:8,82 --> 0:6:11,7
Yes. All right.


94
0:6:11,7 --> 0:6:14,34
Thank you. Thank you.


95
0:6:14,34 --> 0:6:16,98
Good.


96
0:6:16,98 --> 0:6:21,46
ñ (Laughter)
ñ (Man) Minicab for Mr Lyons.


97
0:6:21,46 --> 0:6:24,86
ñ Oh...
ñ (Giggling)


98
0:6:24,86 --> 0:6:30,5
Someone keeps letting the tyres down
on the mobile library.


99
0:6:30,5 --> 0:6:32,66
Really?


100
0:6:32,66 --> 0:6:34,7
Erm, yes.


101
0:6:34,7 --> 0:6:38,82
ñ (Young men belching)
ñ Perhaps it's a slow puncture.


102
0:6:38,82 --> 0:6:42,66
ñ Or...
ñ Er, I don't think so.


103
0:6:42,66 --> 0:6:44,14
Ah.


104
0:6:44,14 --> 0:6:51,22
Probably some bastard from...
WHSmith's.


105
0:6:51,22 --> 0:6:56,14
I think they've changed the sherry in here.


106
0:6:56,14 --> 0:6:58,62
(Laughing)


107
0:6:58,62 --> 0:7:4,38
Can you excuse me, please?
I want to go to the toilet.


108
0:7:4,38 --> 0:7:6,5
Mm.


109
0:7:6,5 --> 0:7:8,5
ñ Mm.
ñ It's a bit tinny.


110
0:7:8,5 --> 0:7:13,58
ñ Are you all right there, mate?
ñ Poof.


111
0:7:13,58 --> 0:7:16,6
ñ D'you know who you look like in a tie?
ñ What?


112
0:7:16,6 --> 0:7:20,38
ñ A complete wanker. A wanker's wanker.
ñ It's my pillarñofñtheñcommunity look.


113
0:7:20,38 --> 0:7:23,58
ñ Pillock of the community.
ñ Top joke, John!


114
0:7:23,58 --> 0:7:26,94
I had to get out of there.
My brains are gonna start tumbling out.


115
0:7:26,94 --> 0:7:30,42
Have a lager. We bought four pints each
to cut down on the walking.


116
0:7:30,42 --> 0:7:32,38
Topñup. Whoo!


117
0:7:32,38 --> 0:7:34,5
ñ Wahey!
ñ Hey!


118
0:7:34,5 --> 0:7:37,2
Just... just... just one.


119
0:7:37,2 --> 0:7:40,78
ñ Oh, yeah!
ñ Oh, yeah!


120
0:7:40,78 --> 0:7:46,34
(Laughing)


121
0:7:46,34 --> 0:7:48,9
# Two men went to mow #


122
0:7:48,9 --> 0:7:51,14
I've always wanted one of these.


123
0:7:51,14 --> 0:7:54,42
ñ What, a cricket pitch? Yeah!
ñ (Both laughing)


124
0:7:54,42 --> 0:7:56,82
ñ Hey, listen, lan.
ñ Yeah.


125
0:7:56,82 --> 0:7:58,86
ñ I've got a secret, right?
ñ OK.


126
0:7:58,86 --> 0:8:7,26
I've always really badly wanted
to have sex with my sister, Helen.


127
0:8:7,26 --> 0:8:12,46
So have I!


128
0:8:12,46 --> 0:8:14,42
Oh, you're very frightening!


129
0:8:14,42 --> 0:8:19,98
(Laughing)


130
0:8:19,98 --> 0:8:34,86
ñ (Horn)
ñ (Tyres screeching)


131
0:8:34,86 --> 0:8:36,3
(Dog barking)


132
0:8:36,3 --> 0:8:38,98
That is incredibly poor roadñholding.


133
0:8:38,98 --> 0:8:43,54
(Laughing hysterically)


134
0:8:43,54 --> 0:8:46,46
Oh, shit. We'd better
make ourselves scarce.


135
0:8:46,46 --> 0:8:48,9
OK. You be plutonium


136
0:8:48,9 --> 0:8:54,46
and I'll be some diamonds.


137
0:8:54,46 --> 0:8:56,26
(Snorting)


138
0:8:56,26 --> 0:9:0,42
It's OK! It's OK! I am a governor.


139
0:9:0,42 --> 0:9:9,74
I am a governor. Go into your house
and prepare for government.


140
0:9:9,74 --> 0:9:13,82
ñ Oh, can I turn the radio on now?
ñ (lan) No. Please. No.


141
0:9:13,82 --> 0:9:17,54
ñ No noise. No noise.
ñ Shall I ring up Jean Bulmer


142
0:9:17,54 --> 0:9:21,22
and tell her you're feeling
too shitty to photograph her today?


143
0:9:21,22 --> 0:9:24,86
No. No.


144
0:9:24,86 --> 0:9:27,74
I'll be all right. In a week.


145
0:9:27,74 --> 0:9:31,7
Did Norriswood complain about
the kids calling us by our first names?


146
0:9:31,7 --> 0:9:35,1
Why do people drink, anyway?


147
0:9:35,1 --> 0:9:40,66
I mean, what is the point of it?
Standing around tipping it into your face.


148
0:9:40,66 --> 0:9:43,62
I've never seen it.


149
0:9:43,62 --> 0:9:47,26
ñ Maybe you should give up for a while.
ñ Yeah. That's a good idea.


150
0:9:47,26 --> 0:9:49,58
ñ You have been knocking it back a bit.
ñ Yeah.


151
0:9:49,58 --> 0:9:53,26
The only friends you've made are
the Hubners, who run the offñlicence.


152
0:9:53,26 --> 0:9:55,86
They're nice people.
We should have them round,


153
0:9:55,86 --> 0:9:57,9
if only to see what bottles they bring.


154
0:9:57,9 --> 0:10:0,22
You could just give up for a month.


155
0:10:0,22 --> 0:10:2,26
No, you have to do it forever.


156
0:10:2,26 --> 0:10:4,98
Make a clean break. Leave it behind.


157
0:10:4,98 --> 0:10:7,58
Go on, leave it.


158
0:10:7,58 --> 0:10:11,74
Tea.


159
0:10:11,74 --> 0:10:14,22
Start... start with a month.


160
0:10:14,22 --> 0:10:17,86
Then segue into forever.


161
0:10:17,86 --> 0:10:22,14
OK, who can tell me
where the two lungs are? Anyone?


162
0:10:22,14 --> 0:10:23,82
(Panting)


163
0:10:23,82 --> 0:10:28,22
Yep, Joe? Would you like to point out
on the diagram?


164
0:10:28,22 --> 0:10:30,82
ñ (Giggling)
ñ Erm, no, you know that's not right.


165
0:10:30,82 --> 0:10:35,62
Pop yourself back in the seat, good lad.
Erm... lungs.


166
0:10:35,62 --> 0:10:38,14
Someone must know
where the lungs are. No?


167
0:10:38,14 --> 0:10:42,3
OK, lungs are there and there
and they're for breathing.


168
0:10:42,3 --> 0:10:45,5
So, the stomach.
Who knows where the tummy is?


169
0:10:45,5 --> 0:10:48,2
ñ Me! Me!
ñ Derek! Derek!


170
0:10:48,2 --> 0:10:50,6
You're all very good at the tummy.


171
0:10:50,6 --> 0:10:55,34
Now open them up
and have a look at the shape.


172
0:10:55,34 --> 0:10:58,5
Natalie, hold yours up, show the headmaster.


173
0:10:58,5 --> 0:11:1,86
ñ How lovely.
ñ Lisa, Lisa, mine's torn.


174
0:11:1,86 --> 0:11:4,14
ñ It doesn't matter.
ñ Can I have more paper?


175
0:11:4,14 --> 0:11:6,86
ñ We've already discussed this.
ñ No.


176
0:11:6,86 --> 0:11:9,98
ñ Gavin, d'you want a drink?
ñ Oh, cheers. Pint.


177
0:11:9,98 --> 0:11:12,46
A pint for Gavin and a fruit juice
for me, please.


178
0:11:12,46 --> 0:11:15,34
ñ Fruit juice?
ñ I've giving up booze for the month.


179
0:11:15,34 --> 0:11:17,82
What, is that cos
you rode on the motorñmower?


180
0:11:17,82 --> 0:11:20,98
No, no. It's about proving I can do it, really.


181
0:11:20,98 --> 0:11:29,66
Be brutal with me if you see me wavering.


182
0:11:29,66 --> 0:11:34,18
Crispy triangle?


183
0:11:34,18 --> 0:11:40,46
The hardest job in building, in all building,
is hanging doors properly.


184
0:11:40,46 --> 0:11:42,66
No, Phil, that's the easiest job.


185
0:11:42,66 --> 0:11:45,7
No, no. It looks easiest,
but it's the hardest.


186
0:11:45,7 --> 0:11:47,9
Well, I don't know. I'm a bit torn.


187
0:11:47,9 --> 0:11:49,66
ñ Why?
ñ Well, er, yeah.


188
0:11:49,66 --> 0:11:52,3
Might I suggest
it's somewhere between the two?


189
0:11:52,3 --> 0:11:58,38
Ooh, everyone listen to Captain Sensible,
Mr Noñdrinks.


190
0:11:58,38 --> 0:12:0,42
Why don't you sponsor me?


191
0:12:0,42 --> 0:12:2,5
ñ In what?
ñ Not drinking.


192
0:12:2,5 --> 0:12:6,54
For a month, say. If I could do a month
you could all give me 90 quid.


193
0:12:6,54 --> 0:12:8,98
(All laugh)


194
0:12:8,98 --> 0:12:11,1
ñ I'm just gonna get a quick pint.
ñ No!


195
0:12:11,1 --> 0:12:13,5
No, no, Mrs.


196
0:12:13,5 --> 0:12:16,78
I insist that pupils at this school


197
0:12:16,78 --> 0:12:21,78
call their teachers
by the traditional Sir or Miss.


198
0:12:21,78 --> 0:12:24,54
ñ The three of us discussed this...
ñ Failure to do so


199
0:12:24,54 --> 0:12:27,78
is one more symptom of the erosion
of discipline in schools


200
0:12:27,78 --> 0:12:29,86
and thence in society as a whole.


201
0:12:29,86 --> 0:12:32,82
The belief that we're all the same,


202
0:12:32,82 --> 0:12:36,1
that a sevenñyearñold girl has
the same rights and privileges


203
0:12:36,1 --> 0:12:37,98
as a... justice of the peace.


204
0:12:37,98 --> 0:12:40,94
ñ Well, doesn't she?
ñ No.


205
0:12:40,94 --> 0:12:44,74
It's the same process of enforced intimacy
whereby in my petrol station


206
0:12:44,74 --> 0:12:50,18
I'm ritually called "mate". Indeed, I know
that matey, "ma'ey", is now creeping in.


207
0:12:50,18 --> 0:12:52,54
Erm, we stand at the front of the class


208
0:12:52,54 --> 0:12:54,7
and tell the children what to do all day.


209
0:12:54,7 --> 0:12:57,22
I think they realise we're not all the same.


210
0:12:57,22 --> 0:13:0,38
And then there's the problem
that Miss suggests


211
0:13:0,38 --> 0:13:3,18
all female teachers
are unmarried girls


212
0:13:3,18 --> 0:13:6,58
and Sir that male teachers
all carry a natural authority.


213
0:13:6,58 --> 0:13:12,2
Oh, yes, well, God forbid.


214
0:13:12,2 --> 0:13:16,7
So... I trust we'll hear no more of this.


215
0:13:16,7 --> 0:13:20,46
Erm, no. I'm afraid,
as a body of, erm, teachers,


216
0:13:20,46 --> 0:13:23,62
we feel quite strongly
that the children should...


217
0:13:23,62 --> 0:13:28,9
I see. And that... is the final view...


218
0:13:28,9 --> 0:13:32,58
of your body?


219
0:13:32,58 --> 0:13:34,66
Mm.


220
0:13:34,66 --> 0:13:37,6
Well, this is an important matter


221
0:13:37,6 --> 0:13:46,6
and I've no choice but to call an emergency
meeting of the school governors.


222
0:13:46,6 --> 0:13:56,62
Will you leave, please?


223
0:13:56,62 --> 0:13:59,18
It's good, isn't it?
Three days without alcohol,


224
0:13:59,18 --> 0:14:1,86
that shows I've got
the willpower of... of an ox.


225
0:14:1,86 --> 0:14:3,5
At least an ox.


226
0:14:3,5 --> 0:14:6,9
It just shows you, when you're
in that state, how pivotal drink is.


227
0:14:6,9 --> 0:14:11,18
It's the great, moist crutch that's
propping up the sick body of British society.


228
0:14:11,18 --> 0:14:14,42
Would you mind not mentioning
moist crutches with my family?


229
0:14:14,42 --> 0:14:17,34
The only question is,
how come I feel like total shit?


230
0:14:17,34 --> 0:14:20,14
ñ It's all the toxins coming out.
ñ That's all I need.


231
0:14:20,14 --> 0:14:23,18
Show me your tongue.
It should be all furry.


232
0:14:23,18 --> 0:14:25,7
Ugh! (Laughing) That's disgusting!


233
0:14:25,7 --> 0:14:28,1
ñ (Angrily) Oh, piss off!
ñ Uhñuhñuh.


234
0:14:28,1 --> 0:14:32,26
I'm sorry, the strain is enormous.
I'm sorry I'm being irritable.


235
0:14:32,26 --> 0:14:34,98
ñ It's good, isn't it?
ñ Mm. Isn't the problem


236
0:14:34,98 --> 0:14:38,62
that there's an insufficient
client base to support a photographer,


237
0:14:38,62 --> 0:14:40,82
so you're ultimately doomed?


238
0:14:40,82 --> 0:14:42,46
ñ Doomed.
ñ Doomed.


239
0:14:42,46 --> 0:14:44,3
Doomed.


240
0:14:44,3 --> 0:14:47,46
If you'll just excuse me,
I'm going to get a drink.


241
0:14:47,46 --> 0:14:50,1
No, lan, we're all being very supportive.


242
0:14:50,1 --> 0:14:52,22
Yes, we're all very proud of you.


243
0:14:52,22 --> 0:14:54,78
Can I change my pledge
to drinking in moderation?


244
0:14:54,78 --> 0:14:57,9
ñ No, you can't.
ñ Helen, draw the curtains.


245
0:14:57,9 --> 0:15:0,98
Oh, yes, OK. Hang on. Right.


246
0:15:0,98 --> 0:15:3,94
ñ Erm, OK, so, hello, everyone. Hello?
ñ Hello!


247
0:15:3,94 --> 0:15:5,98
We're gathered here this evening


248
0:15:5,98 --> 0:15:10,26
to celebrate me finally having put up
curtains throughout my house. Yey!


249
0:15:10,26 --> 0:15:12,86
ñ Hooray.
ñ I know. It's taken seven years.


250
0:15:12,86 --> 0:15:17,1
And this is the last curtain, which
I am now going to solemnly draw across.


251
0:15:17,1 --> 0:15:20,54
Oh, no, lan, you do it,
as the latest arrival in the family.


252
0:15:20,54 --> 0:15:23,66
ñ Oh, no, I couldn't possibly.
ñ Do it.


253
0:15:23,66 --> 0:15:25,7
ñ Go on.
ñ I'll just... do it.


254
0:15:25,7 --> 0:15:30,26
ñ Yay!
ñ Whoo!


255
0:15:30,26 --> 0:15:33,34
ñ Super pattern, darling. Super pattern.
ñ Lovely.


256
0:15:33,34 --> 0:15:37,62
ñ Yeah, but not the right colour.
ñ Oh, course it's the right colour. It is.


257
0:15:37,62 --> 0:15:49,22
I've made a terrible mistake
and I feel sick.


258
0:15:49,22 --> 0:15:51,62
Come on. Come on.


259
0:15:51,62 --> 0:15:53,7
It's OK, come on. Come on.


260
0:15:53,7 --> 0:16:11,98
It's OK.


261
0:16:11,98 --> 0:16:15,38
ñ The usual, please.
ñ No, I'm sorry.


262
0:16:15,38 --> 0:16:18,78
ñ Hm?
ñ You told me to refuse to serve you alcohol.


263
0:16:18,78 --> 0:16:20,9
Oh, the pledge? Oh, right.


264
0:16:20,9 --> 0:16:23,98
That's changed from, you know,
to drinking in moderation.


265
0:16:23,98 --> 0:16:34,66
ñ You said, "Don't ever listen to me."
ñ Not never ever.


266
0:16:34,66 --> 0:16:36,94
ñ It's a whole... lan.
ñ Hi.


267
0:16:36,94 --> 0:16:39,82
ñ lñlñan!
ñ lñlñan!


268
0:16:39,82 --> 0:16:41,78
ñ Hi.
ñ Hello.


269
0:16:41,78 --> 0:16:43,98
John, will you buy me a pint, please?


270
0:16:43,98 --> 0:16:47,2
ñ No. You said you'd never ever...
ñ I know what I said.


271
0:16:47,2 --> 0:16:49,6
This is a test, isn't it?


272
0:16:49,6 --> 0:17:0,62
Will anybody please... Will anybody...


273
0:17:0,62 --> 0:17:5,5
ñ Can I have 15 portions of sherry trifle, please?
ñ No.


274
0:17:5,5 --> 0:17:8,6
ñ Give me a grapefruit juice.
ñ Pink or regular?


275
0:17:8,6 --> 0:17:9,82
I don't give a toss.


276
0:17:9,82 --> 0:17:12,9
God, have a drink!
If you need one so much.


277
0:17:12,9 --> 0:17:14,82
I don't need it! I don't care!


278
0:17:14,82 --> 0:17:17,34
Anyway, you've drank the house dry.


279
0:17:17,34 --> 0:17:34,7
Just think what it says about us if you
can't survive without a drink down here.


280
0:17:34,7 --> 0:17:36,42
ñ Hi.
ñ lan.


281
0:17:36,42 --> 0:17:38,9
ñ Hi.
ñ Peter. Hi. How are you two?


282
0:17:38,9 --> 0:17:42,6
ñ Ooh, very well. How are you, lan?
ñ Oh, I'm OK. You know.


283
0:17:42,6 --> 0:17:45,1
I'm OK.


284
0:17:45,1 --> 0:17:48,2
ñ How did Louis get over his leg?
ñ Oh, very well, thanks.


285
0:17:48,2 --> 0:17:50,3
Fortunately, it turned out to be a twist.


286
0:17:50,3 --> 0:17:53,78
Oh, right. I'll just take one of these.
A twist, eh? That's good.


287
0:17:53,78 --> 0:17:55,82
I'm sorry, lan. No.


288
0:17:55,82 --> 0:17:56,94
What?


289
0:17:56,94 --> 0:18:0,7
I'm sorry, but if a medical practitioner
or a customer himself


290
0:18:0,7 --> 0:18:5,22
asks us not to serve someone,
then we do like to stick to that.


291
0:18:5,22 --> 0:18:7,1
But you're an offñlicence.


292
0:18:7,1 --> 0:18:10,66
I mean, I could accuse you of... hypocrisy.


293
0:18:10,66 --> 0:18:15,46
Oh, well.


294
0:18:15,46 --> 0:18:19,94
It's for my Uncle Teddy.


295
0:18:19,94 --> 0:18:22,38
He's got this, er, blood alcohol thing.


296
0:18:22,38 --> 0:18:33,66
He needs to have the right ratio, otherwise
he can't breathe through his nose.


297
0:18:33,66 --> 0:18:37,6
I'm not an alcoholic.
That's obviously what people think.


298
0:18:37,6 --> 0:18:40,98
Well, but I must... I should be...
I should be an alcoholic down here.


299
0:18:40,98 --> 0:18:43,54
In the great nothingness. But I'm not.


300
0:18:43,54 --> 0:18:47,1
But if somebody tells me I can't
have something or, "You can't do it,"


301
0:18:47,1 --> 0:18:50,14
I think, "Well, I want it, I'll have it"
and "I will do it."


302
0:18:50,14 --> 0:18:55,62
That's why I... That's why I only lasted
eight minutes as a vegetarian.


303
0:18:55,62 --> 0:18:58,3
But the implications, as well.
Personal freedom.


304
0:18:58,3 --> 0:19:1,5
Cos if you say to somebody,
"You can't change your mind,"


305
0:19:1,5 --> 0:19:4,74
that means that it becomes...
It's all like, you know...


306
0:19:4,74 --> 0:19:7,58
And 1984. Rolled into one.


307
0:19:7,58 --> 0:19:9,74
Is there a choice of background?


308
0:19:9,74 --> 0:19:15,38
Uh?


309
0:19:15,38 --> 0:19:20,2
You know, er, actually, I was wondering,
could I, er... Very quickly, cos my wife is...


310
0:19:20,2 --> 0:19:23,66
Could I, er, just to nip into Penfold.
Could I borrow your car?


311
0:19:23,66 --> 0:19:26,82
No, I have to do the shopping.


312
0:19:26,82 --> 0:19:38,1
Right. Shopping. Right.


313
0:19:38,1 --> 0:19:41,7
Three... On Tuesdays and Saturdays!
I don't believe it.


314
0:19:41,7 --> 0:19:46,26
Shit!


315
0:19:46,26 --> 0:19:55,98
# Fifteen barrels of cold water #


316
0:19:55,98 --> 0:20:0,78
ñ Oh.
ñ Er, sorry. I move rather quietly.


317
0:20:0,78 --> 0:20:2,38
Headmaster.


318
0:20:2,38 --> 0:20:5,78
I... I wanted to have a chat
about tonight's governors' meeting.


319
0:20:5,78 --> 0:20:10,1
I'm distressed to find myself
isolated on this issue.


320
0:20:10,1 --> 0:20:14,26
As my father, governor Yardley, always
says, "You must be doing something right


321
0:20:14,26 --> 0:20:18,42
"if nobody agrees with
anything you say or do."


322
0:20:18,42 --> 0:20:21,58
Don't get frustrated, Carl.
Remember what we talked about.


323
0:20:21,58 --> 0:20:25,62
Yes. Yes, your fa... He's very...


324
0:20:25,62 --> 0:20:28,58
But perhaps we should talk about... awe.


325
0:20:28,58 --> 0:20:31,6
Or... what?


326
0:20:31,6 --> 0:20:35,74
Er, wonderment, awe.
Which I regard as a good thing.


327
0:20:35,74 --> 0:20:39,7
It seems to me that awe drives everything
that's good about the world.


328
0:20:39,7 --> 0:20:44,66
We need awe to, er... to love people,
to look up to our heroes


329
0:20:44,66 --> 0:20:47,46
or to change the world.
And awe is now under attack.


330
0:20:47,46 --> 0:20:53,9
It's being replaced by indifference, stupor,
blind tolerance and cool.


331
0:20:53,9 --> 0:20:56,74
I suppose this is my point. This is my point.


332
0:20:56,74 --> 0:21:2,1
If a pupil loses his, er or her, erm...
awe for their teacher,


333
0:21:2,1 --> 0:21:4,5
albeit mixed up with other emotions,


334
0:21:4,5 --> 0:21:7,42
er, learning and selfñcontrol break down.


335
0:21:7,42 --> 0:21:10,46
So you think that the children
would have more awe for me


336
0:21:10,46 --> 0:21:12,82
if they called me Miss, then?


337
0:21:12,82 --> 0:21:15,1
No, I...


338
0:21:15,1 --> 0:21:17,18
Look, if Miss is a stumbling block


339
0:21:17,18 --> 0:21:19,62
I'd be prepared to compromise
on Mrs Lyons.


340
0:21:19,62 --> 0:21:22,2
I'm sure Mr Few and Mrs Deacon
wouldn't mind


341
0:21:22,2 --> 0:21:24,6
and then we could avoid this meeting.


342
0:21:24,6 --> 0:21:30,1
No, I don't think that would be fair.


343
0:21:30,1 --> 0:21:31,62
Fine.


344
0:21:31,62 --> 0:21:34,58
I'm coming tonight, by the way.


345
0:21:34,58 --> 0:21:37,62
That's... not normal.


346
0:21:37,62 --> 0:21:40,54
Oh, well.


347
0:21:40,54 --> 0:21:44,22
Top shelf.


348
0:21:44,22 --> 0:21:46,5
I'm sorry I've been away.


349
0:21:46,5 --> 0:21:51,2
I meant to call. But I'm back now.


350
0:21:51,2 --> 0:21:53,94
And another one.


351
0:21:53,94 --> 0:21:56,98
Another one.
For the little boy who lives down the lane.


352
0:21:56,98 --> 0:22:1,94
And... something for the plants.


353
0:22:1,94 --> 0:22:5,5
No, I can't carry that for four bloody miles.


354
0:22:5,5 --> 0:22:14,1
No, I'll eat them.


355
0:22:14,1 --> 0:22:25,26
Hi.


356
0:22:25,26 --> 0:22:27,3
That would have been really annoying.


357
0:22:27,3 --> 0:22:30,46
I'm sorry, mate. You're on my board.


358
0:22:30,46 --> 0:22:32,1
What?


359
0:22:32,1 --> 0:22:38,42
"Do not serve this man alcohol."


360
0:22:38,42 --> 0:22:47,1
D'you still want the biscuits, though?


361
0:22:47,1 --> 0:22:51,66
(Coin rattling)


362
0:22:51,66 --> 0:22:54,74
(Groaning)


363
0:22:54,74 --> 0:22:58,98
Why do I have to eat the whole packet?
Why does he eat the whole packet?


364
0:22:58,98 --> 0:23:1,14
Stay away from me.


365
0:23:1,14 --> 0:23:4,94
(Shouting)


366
0:23:4,94 --> 0:23:6,54
ñ Give me an A!
ñ A!


367
0:23:6,54 --> 0:23:11,5
ñ Give me an A!
ñ A!


368
0:23:11,5 --> 0:23:14,5
So what brings you out and about, then,
nature boy?


369
0:23:14,5 --> 0:23:21,34
I went to get a drink and my photograph
is in the pub and the offñlicence.


370
0:23:21,34 --> 0:23:23,38
Are you suggesting it was us?


371
0:23:23,38 --> 0:23:30,42
ñ Well, it was, wasn't it?
ñ Yeah. So?


372
0:23:30,42 --> 0:23:34,18
Here, lan...
Look, don't take it so bad, mate.


373
0:23:34,18 --> 0:23:36,66
We're only trying to help you
to help yourself.


374
0:23:36,66 --> 0:23:39,82
We're like your personal trainers,
your liver police.


375
0:23:39,82 --> 0:23:42,78
Dean, just go away.
You're making me feel more sober.


376
0:23:42,78 --> 0:23:45,22
No! No, I won't. No.


377
0:23:45,22 --> 0:23:47,38
And I'll tell you why not.


378
0:23:47,38 --> 0:23:53,3
Because I've got something at home
which will help ease your pain.


379
0:23:53,3 --> 0:23:58,1
Without interfering with
your solemn and binding pledge.


380
0:23:58,1 --> 0:24:0,18
I've got a school governors' meeting.


381
0:24:0,18 --> 0:24:2,9
No, no. Lan, this is far more important.


382
0:24:2,9 --> 0:24:7,58
Now... some people make these into tea.


383
0:24:7,58 --> 0:24:10,82
Some people cook 'em up in an omelette.


384
0:24:10,82 --> 0:24:14,2
But me, I... I just chew 'em.


385
0:24:14,2 --> 0:24:16,86
Because, well, that's me, I suppose.


386
0:24:16,86 --> 0:24:19,66
I don't know, Dean. I'm a bit nervous.


387
0:24:19,66 --> 0:24:23,78
Don't be nervous. Look, it's mushroom.
It's a growing thing.


388
0:24:23,78 --> 0:24:26,78
Everything that grows is good.


389
0:24:26,78 --> 0:24:30,9
So, erm, how did the, er...


390
0:24:30,9 --> 0:24:33,22
grand opening of the curtains go, then?


391
0:24:33,22 --> 0:24:37,42
ñ Fine. If you like that kind of thing.
ñ Yeah.


392
0:24:37,42 --> 0:24:40,5
Why don't you go to
any of those family dos?


393
0:24:40,5 --> 0:24:45,18
Dunno, really. I suppose because
I sense I don't really belong.


394
0:24:45,18 --> 0:24:48,78
I mean, I'm the youngest.


395
0:24:48,78 --> 0:24:53,46
In a lot of ways I'm, you know,
regarded as the runt of the family.


396
0:24:53,46 --> 0:24:59,98
ñ But a big runt, you know?
ñ Mm. You are. You're a big runt.


397
0:24:59,98 --> 0:25:2,98
ñ Yeah. Yeah, a big runt.
ñ A big runt.


398
0:25:2,98 --> 0:25:7,78
ñ A big runt.
ñ A really big... runt.


399
0:25:7,78 --> 0:25:11,74
ñ (lan, smacking lips) Very nibbly, aren't they?
ñ Mm.


400
0:25:11,74 --> 0:25:14,78
ñ (Dean) In a sort of chicken kind of way.
ñ Mm.


401
0:25:14,78 --> 0:25:17,34
(lan) Fingerñlickin', mindñwarping good.


402
0:25:17,34 --> 0:25:22,46
Well, I should declare an interest
in that Lisa is my daughter. Obviously.


403
0:25:22,46 --> 0:25:26,6
And if she says this change
is benefiting the children,


404
0:25:26,6 --> 0:25:28,1
that's good enough for me.


405
0:25:28,1 --> 0:25:34,42
Fine. Naked nepotism
was ne'er so charmingly expressed.


406
0:25:34,42 --> 0:25:37,7
Nevertheless, we are here
to reach a balanced judgment...


407
0:25:37,7 --> 0:25:40,58
ñ (Twanging, jingling)
ñ... on this situation.


408
0:25:40,58 --> 0:25:44,54
Look what I found in the hall.


409
0:25:44,54 --> 0:25:46,74
Just lying there.


410
0:25:46,74 --> 0:25:48,82
Sorry I'm late. Carry on.


411
0:25:48,82 --> 0:25:50,94
Been having mushrooms with Dean.


412
0:25:50,94 --> 0:25:53,7
ñ My own...
ñ Totally clean. Nothing to drink.


413
0:25:53,7 --> 0:25:56,6
ñ Sorry, carry on.
ñ (Chiming)


414
0:25:56,6 --> 0:26:1,98
My own view is that school
should be a preparation for life.


415
0:26:1,98 --> 0:26:5,74
And we live in a formal society,


416
0:26:5,74 --> 0:26:10,66
so school should reflect that formality.
Oh...


417
0:26:10,66 --> 0:26:12,94
I didn't understand a word of that. Did you?


418
0:26:12,94 --> 0:26:15,7
What? Oh, no. Good point.
Good point. Good point.


419
0:26:15,7 --> 0:26:20,18
It's very complex. Like those pictures in
the hall, the ones we should have in here,


420
0:26:20,18 --> 0:26:24,14
ñ the purple beetle and...
ñ Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.


421
0:26:24,14 --> 0:26:29,38
(Clears throat) We've been discussing
this now for quite a long time and...


422
0:26:29,38 --> 0:26:33,9
we're all, to a greater or a lesser extent,
tired!


423
0:26:33,9 --> 0:26:39,22
So hands up those in favour of
the traditional form of address.


424
0:26:39,22 --> 0:26:42,62
ñ Two, three, four.
ñ Look at the pictures, look at the pictures.


425
0:26:42,62 --> 0:26:47,5
Those in favour of the new way, hands up.


426
0:26:47,5 --> 0:26:50,1
...three, four. Four each.


427
0:26:50,1 --> 0:26:52,42
Mr Lyons, you have the casting vote.


428
0:26:52,42 --> 0:26:54,82
ñ Is it me?
ñ It's you.


429
0:26:54,82 --> 0:26:58,54
I've listened to the ebb and flow,
back and forth, here we are again.


430
0:26:58,54 --> 0:27:0,58
What'll we do? I don't know.


431
0:27:0,58 --> 0:27:3,66
ñ But nobody's mentioned this echo.
ñ (Footsteps echoing)


432
0:27:3,66 --> 0:27:7,98
Amazing. It's actually better if there's
some background noise. You be a hen.


433
0:27:7,98 --> 0:27:10,22
You be a hen and I'll go over there.


434
0:27:10,22 --> 0:27:12,42
ñ Be a hen.
ñ (Clucks)


435
0:27:12,42 --> 0:27:16,62
ñ Yeah. And I'll go over here and do the...
ñ Stop this.


436
0:27:16,62 --> 0:27:18,74
Not you. The lady with the moving hair.


437
0:27:18,74 --> 0:27:21,7
ñ Stop this!
ñ That's another very good point.


438
0:27:21,7 --> 0:27:24,9
So it's me again, is it?
Ebb and flow and all that.


439
0:27:24,9 --> 0:27:28,34
OK. Well, I happen to think that
children are people.


440
0:27:28,34 --> 0:27:30,38
I think. Smaller. Much smaller.


441
0:27:30,38 --> 0:27:33,2
Little trousers, little voices, but still people.


442
0:27:33,2 --> 0:27:37,2
They should be allowed to call anybody
by their given name, whatever that is.


443
0:27:37,2 --> 0:27:41,3
In this case, it's Honor and Lisa
and... the man. What's his name again?


444
0:27:41,3 --> 0:27:43,46
ñ Derek.
ñ Oh, yeah.


445
0:27:43,46 --> 0:27:46,2
I mean, am I right? Astley? Astle? Assles?


446
0:27:46,2 --> 0:27:47,94
Yes.


447
0:27:47,94 --> 0:27:52,6
ñ See?
ñ I'm afraid... I don't think you are.


448
0:27:52,6 --> 0:27:56,86
Oh. Well, that's the way I'm voting, they're
the votes from the Irish jury, so stuff you.


449
0:27:56,86 --> 0:28:0,22
Oh...


450
0:28:0,22 --> 0:28:2,5
That's it. Good evening.


451
0:28:2,5 --> 0:28:6,2
Well, now, all go home.
Home, home, home, home, home. Home.


452
0:28:6,2 --> 0:28:8,86
See you in the pub!


453
0:28:8,86 --> 0:28:13,46
We always go for an amontillado
afterwards. Don't we? Lads? Lads?


454
0:28:13,46 --> 0:28:16,5
Bit of sherry. Hm?


455
0:28:16,5 --> 0:28:20,66
Some of that gingeryñlooking crap
you all drink.


456
0:28:20,66 --> 0:28:23,78
Where are you going?


457
0:28:23,78 --> 0:28:28,34
ñ It was all right, wasn't it?
ñ Mm.


458
0:28:28,34 --> 0:30:28,34
I thought so.
