###13 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: We`re a week and a half away from Halloween, the presidential
###16 election is two weeks off and you are right on time for a new week of CNN STUDENT NEWS.
###21 My name is Carl Azuz, let`s go ahead and get started.
###25 First up, protesters in Lebanon, including one former prime minister, are speaking out
###30 against Lebanon`s current prime minister. They want him out of office. Lebanon is home
###34 to around 4 million people. It`s located in the Middle East, on the Mediterranean Sea,
###40 right next door to Syria. Some observers are concerned that the violence that`s been going
###45 in Syria could spread to Lebanon where it has already. Last Friday a car bomb went off
###51 in the Lebanese capital of Beirut. Three people were killed including the country`s intelligence
###56 chief. Syria spoke out against the attack, but some Lebanese officials blame Syria for
###63 it. Yesterday, after the intelligence leaders funeral protesters fought with security forces
###68 in Beirut. The crowd threw rocks, police used tear gas to break up the protests. Several
###74 people were reportedly injured.

###77 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is this legit? Someone is officially recognized as a saint when he
###83 or she is canonized.
###86 This is true. In the Roman Catholic Church, canonization is the act of recognizing a saint.
###92 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###95 AZUZ: The Roman Catholic Church recognized seven people as new saints over the weekend.
###100 The canonization ceremony included some history as well. For the first time, a Native American
###105 was named a saint. During a special mass in Saint Peter`s Square on Sunday, Pope Benedict
###111 XVI and other worshippers celebrated the new saints. The pope praised Kateri Tekawitha
###117 for living a life of service. Tekawitha was a member of the Mohawk Tribe, sometimes known
###122 as Lily of the Mohawks. She converted to Catholicism and served as a nun.
###128 This week is a special time for another world religion. It`s Hajj, one of the five main
###132 observances of Islam. Millions of Muslims participate in Hajj every year, traveling
###138 to the city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia. Fionnuala Sweeney has more on this annual tradition.
###143 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###144 FIONNUALA SWEENEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Its name means "to set out for a place," and for
###148 Muslims around the world, that place is the holy city of Mecca. The Hajj has begun for
###155 millions of Muslims, with pilgrims making their way toward Islam`s most sacred site.
###160 A cube shaped building called the Kaabaa located in the Grand Mosque. For daily prayers, Muslims
###167 face this structure from any given point in the world. They are also required, if able,
###172 to make this pilgrimage at least once in their lives. And then walk seven times around the
###177 Kaabaa, counter clockwise in a ritual called the Tawaf.
###181 IBTISAM SAYED HASSAN, EGYPTIAN PILGRIM (through translator): Islam is beautiful, and we are
###185 beautiful. We love all people, we love all countries.
###189 SWEENEY: The Grand Mosque`s gleaming minarets soar skyward, pilgrims here cry as perform
###195 the daily prayers from these towers, calling the faithful five times a day. Fionnuala Sweeney,
###203 CNN.
###203 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###204 AZUZ: To our viewers who are already on Facebook, at Facebook.com/cnnstudentnews, we asked if
###210 the release of a popular videogame could distract some people from voting.
###215 Awnna says "Maybe. Some people are so obsessed with video games that they put aside the thought
###220 of who`s running our nation."
###222 Nicolo assumes that most people who are interested in games aren`t as interested in the presidential
###228 election."
###229 Janie writes, "I play games, but I`m voting this year. If someone lets a game to take
###234 their right to vote away, then they are ungrateful.
###237 Tyler doesn`t think video games will be distracting. He says most people interested in Halo aren`t
###241 old enough to vote.
###243 Jamie says, "Games are better than politics when the country is in dire financial crisis.
###248 You need something to lift people`s spirits and lighten the mood.
###251 From Bridgette, "As a gamer, I get excited for releases and caught up in the game. But
###256 taking a few minutes to vote is not a difficult thing to do.
###260 From Andrew, if a person puts a videogame before their future, then our country is in
###264 trouble. And Cambria says, "As time goes on, game releases could impact things if politics
###271 doesn`t move into a region that everyone cares deeply about.
###275 But before we get to election day, President Obama and Republican presidential nominee
###279 Romney go head to head in person one more time. It`s debate number three, it`s in Boca
###285 Raton, Florida, it`s happening tonight at 9 p.m. Eastern. Before you watch the debate
###291 either on CNN or at cnn.com/debates, Athena Jones gives us a preview of what to look for.
###297 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###297 ATHENA JONES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The third and final face-off between President Obama
###301 and Governor Romney will focus entirely on foreign policy.
###305 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No! Get out! Get out! Get out!
###307 JONES: From Afghanistan and Pakistan to Israel, Iran and the changing Middle East.
###312 (CROSSTALK)
###313 JONES: The candidates will spar over America`s role in the world, the new face of terrorism
###319 and how to deal with the rising China. With polls showing the president`s advantage over
###323 Romney on foreign policy has narrowed since the summer, Mr. Obama tried to highlight one
###329 of his biggest foreign policy accomplishments at a light-hearted charity dinner in New York.
###333 OBAMA: And Monday`s debate is a little bit different because the topic is foreign policy.
###342 Spoiler alert -- we got bin Laden.
###344 (laughter)
###344 JONES: For his part, Romney could try again to bash the president for his administration`s
###349 messy response to the attack in Libya last month and link it to what he says a failed
###355 approach to the region.
###355 MITT ROMNEY, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This calls into question the president`s whole
###358 policy in the Middle East. Look what`s happening in Syria, in Egypt, now in Libya.
###363 JON ALTERMAN, CSIS, DIR., MIDDLE EAST PROGRAM: The challenge for President Obama is going
###366 to be defining the Middle East strategy going forward. I mean, he`s had some successes,
###374 he`s had some things that are still pretty murky.
###377 JONES: Romney`s task could be bigger.
###379 ALTERMAN: I think for Romney, there is a broad challenge, and that is how do you drill down
###385 into specific policies? The Republican Party hasn`t really figured out what a Republican
###390 foreign policy looks like after the Bush administration. I think Romney has been uneager to really
###398 delve into that.
###400 JONES: Still, while important to many voters, foreign policy ranks far below the economy.
###404 RYAN LIZZA, "THE NEW YORKER": If you are Mitt Romney, every second you are talking about
###407 foreign policy is wasted, which might mean that Romney tries to break out of that and
###414 tries to bring home some of the foreign policy issues to domestic economic issues.
###419 JONES: With time running out, this is their last chance to make their case to millions
###424 of voters in a single night. Athena Jones, CNN, Washington.
###428 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###429 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###430 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes out to Mrs. Scarborough`s "Studizens" at Independence
###436 Middle School in Virginia Beach, Virginia.
###437 The Rangers, Kings, Bruins and Jets all play in what professional sports league? Here we
###445 go, is it the NBA, MLB, NFL or NHL? You`ve got three seconds, go!
###455 The only place you`ll find all four of those teams is the National Hockey League. That`s
###463 your answer and that`s your "Shoutout."
###465 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###468 AZUZ: The thing is, you won`t see any of those teams on the ice any time soon. The National
###474 Hockey League season was supposed to start in October, 11th. The league already canceled
###478 its schedule through October 24th, and on Friday it extended that through November 1st.
###484 The issue is that the NHL has locked out its players. The two sides are trying to negotiate
###489 a new contract for how they split up the money that the league makes. So far, though, they
###495 haven`t been able to make a deal. 135 games were scheduled between October 11th and November,
###501 1st. The last time the NHL had a lockout was in 2004, and that year it was the entire season
###508 that ended up being canceled.
###510 We think you are going to get a kick out of this next video, but we`ve got to set the
###513 scene for you. High school football game in Spokane, Washington, two seconds left, team
###519 was down by three, coach sends in a kicker to try a field goal. No pressure, right? Now,
###524 try this: it`s a 67 yard attempt. The kick is up, but it`s got a long way to go. Watch
###531 this.
###531 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###532 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wow!
###534 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He mega kicked.
###535 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###536 AZUZ: Yes, he did. It`s good. 67 yards by a high school senior. The NFL record is 63
###544 yards. The kick sent the game in overtime, and the team would go on to win by a touchdown.
###550 And before we go, we are heading to a mountain top in China, but that`s just a jumping off
###554 point for this story. It`s an international wing suit flying competition. What`s a wing
###560 suit? That thing. It uses extra material between the arms and legs to help with flight. The
###566 competitors had to fly a certain path through a valley before popping open their parachutes.
###572 Fastest time to complete the course wins. Though flying without an airplane might seem
###577 kind of crazy, those guys probably don`t spend time nervously winging their hands about it.
###582 It suits them just fine. It`s time for us to fly away on a wing and a prayer, but CNN
###586 STUDENT NEWS will be back tomorrow with your debate coverage. I`m Carl Azuz. See you soon.
