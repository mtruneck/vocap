1
0:0:2,93 --> 0:0:9,92
I'd like you to say something about what I'm
about to say. Correct it. 'Let us sit and


2
0:0:9,92 --> 0:0:15,61
reason together.' Say something about that.
What do you mean by reason? 'Think positively!'


3
0:0:15,61 --> 0:0:32,59
 - I’m not normal. What does that - what
is logic? 'Use your head, use your natural


4
0:0:32,59 --> 0:0:38,149
inclinations.' He’s saying, 'look at it
my way.' Yes, that's what he's saying. Let


5
0:0:38,149 --> 0:0:46,89
us sit and reason together means, see if you
can see things my way. That's impossible conversation.


6
0:0:46,89 --> 0:0:53,95
Or, 'you shouldn't have done that' if a person
honestly doesn't know what to do about something


7
0:0:53,95 --> 0:0:59,719
you say 'you shouldn't have done that', it's
better to say what you can do to make it work.


8
0:0:59,719 --> 0:1:6,32
Rather than you shouldn't have done that.
Give them something to do that'll make it


9
0:1:6,32 --> 0:1:14,31
work. If your cat rubs its body against you
and you kick the cat, that doesn't change


10
0:1:14,31 --> 0:1:22,27
the pattern, he may move away then. But what
you're really interested in is - I'm getting


11
0:1:22,27 --> 0:1:28,799
right to the point now - is manipulating the
environment, that's what you really want.


12
0:1:28,799 --> 0:1:34,17
The purpose of language is not to communicate,
it's to control the behavior of other people.


13
0:1:34,17 --> 0:1:36,71
When you tell another person 'mow the lawn,
I'll give you 5 bucks' he says 'no' - '10


14
0:1:36,71 --> 0:1:51,28
bucks?' - 'yes I’ll mow the lawn', y'know.
Money is a control device to a limited extent.


15
0:1:51,28 --> 0:1:56,86
If you offer a girl 5 dollars to have sex
with her, she’d feel terribly insulted,


16
0:1:56,86 --> 0:2:2,18
but if you give her 1 million dollars , she
might have to think about it, even though


17
0:2:2,18 --> 0:2:9,979
she's a moralist. She might have to sit a
moral society for that deal, otherwise I have


18
0:2:9,979 --> 0:2:19,709
to work for 40 years and never get that opportunity.
Is it an opportunity? It could be an insult


19
0:2:19,709 --> 0:2:29,419
to some people. So, 'use your head' is no
language at all, or 'you’re dumb, you’re


20
0:2:29,419 --> 0:2:36,99
dumb' there's no language no communication,
or 'you shouldn't have done that’ is no


21
0:2:36,99 --> 0:2:43,26
communication, or 'I hate you!' is no communication.
Unless you say, 'the sink run and overflowed


22
0:2:43,26 --> 0:2:50,879
everything and I had to work 4 hours cleaning
it up, try not to do that again, otherwise


23
0:2:50,879 --> 0:2:57,719
I won’t let you near the sink' ok? Whatever
it is that you have to do. So you've got a


24
0:2:57,719 --> 0:3:7,89
long way to go - most language is noise. When
people sit and talk to each other and check


25
0:3:7,89 --> 0:3:12,68
with them 3 days later what did you talk about,
they usually don’t know cause it was not


26
0:3:12,68 --> 0:3:19,419
significant. When normal people get together
and talk, they usually say nothing, they can't


27
0:3:19,419 --> 0:3:26,51
say anything. So when you have a Zeitgeist
meeting, they can only talk within the realm


28
0:3:26,51 --> 0:3:38,59
of what they think that means. Are you with
me? Do you understand if the brain is perfectly


29
0:3:38,59 --> 0:3:46,729
organised, all the tissue is good quality,
it has no mechanism for knowing how to react


30
0:3:46,729 --> 0:3:59,929
under varying conditions, that's learned.
They say 'you can't pass on what you learn'


31
0:3:59,929 --> 0:4:8,79
 - it seems to me - that’s a semantic term
'it seems to me' it's always good to use 'it


32
0:4:8,79 --> 0:4:15,939
seems to me that this is so' meaning 'that's
so' - 'it seems to me' - now if I look at


33
0:4:15,939 --> 0:4:23,2
person that's tri-sexual, tries anything,
I would say that they’ve been off into some


34
0:4:23,2 --> 0:4:28,36
odd direction, but I don't look down at them.
I know that I could've been brought up that


35
0:4:28,36 --> 0:4:35,86
way, I could've been brought up by the headhunters
 - if you take a baby from a civilised world,


36
0:4:35,86 --> 0:4:42,389
2 years old and bring him up as a head-hunter
he'd be a head-hunter, and if you say 'that’s


37
0:4:42,389 --> 0:4:49,31
a terrible thing' I don’t know that it's
much more terrible than the world you live


38
0:4:49,31 --> 0:4:56,169
in. When a guy's a plumber and another guy's
an electrician, I think that's unfair use


39
0:4:56,169 --> 0:5:3,65
of the brain to make a person an electrician
or a plumber - generalist, you're giving them


40
0:5:3,65 --> 0:5:11,65
more tools, not all the tools but more tools,
that's what a person craves at a meeting,


41
0:5:11,65 --> 0:5:17,28
they don't know why they go there, they say
they go there because 'I like the Zeitgeist


42
0:5:17,28 --> 0:5:24,319
Movement' or 'I like the Venus Project' and
if you pin them down - what do you think the


43
0:5:24,319 --> 0:5:34,31
Venus Project is? 'It's a different interpretation
of lifestyle' - 'how different?' pin them


44
0:5:34,31 --> 0:5:39,659
down, see if you can get information. They
usually don't provide the information, because


45
0:5:39,659 --> 0:5:59,9
they don't know that much about it. I'll open
this up to questions. If you have any? I had


46
0:5:59,9 --> 0:6:8,34
some requests from people if you could talk
more a little bit about anthropology? Anthropology?


47
0:6:8,34 --> 0:6:9,249
As a scientific discipline. In anthropology
they're ok, when they step out of the field


48
0:6:9,249 --> 0:6:17,33
they usually conform, or they can get a job
as a teacher of anthropology but the anthropologist


49
0:6:17,33 --> 0:6:26,729
studies different cultures, mainly primitive,
but he doesn't think his own culture is primitive.


50
0:6:26,729 --> 0:6:43,58
See, unfortunately, there's no field you can
study today that isn't entrapped in
a culture somewhere. Do you know what that


51
0:6:43,58 --> 0:6:47,669
means? It's hard to escape, and if you really
succeeded in escaping from your culture, you'd


52
0:6:47,669 --> 0:6:55,52
have difficulty talking to people, alls you'd
be doing is informing them. And they say,


53
0:6:55,52 --> 0:7:2,949
'what are your qualifications for informing
me?' say 'what do you get out of it?' that's


54
0:7:2,949 --> 0:7:10,919
the qualifications, if you get nothing out
of it there's no qualifications. Qualification


55
0:7:10,919 --> 0:7:17,69
is, how well does the system work? If you
don't water your plants they don't grow, so


56
0:7:17,69 --> 0:7:25,169
you water them. If the water's contaminated
with chemicals and poisons, the plants die,


57
0:7:25,169 --> 0:7:41,219
the only way to know that is to do what they
call 'the wrong thing' it’s never the wrong


58
0:7:41,219 --> 0:7:50,34
thing. In science like on the Larry King show
last when they were talking about brain and


59
0:7:50,34 --> 0:7:50,58
mind and trying to distinguish one from another.
yes, what's the difference? Yeah I don't see


60
0:7:50,58 --> 0:7:58,77
any. The brain is like a battery, the charge
is the mind. Do you know what that means?


61
0:7:58,77 --> 0:8:3,96
If I put up a sign 'batteries free of charge'
that would mean no electrical charge in them,


62
0:8:3,96 --> 0:8:12,61
it doesn't mean you can take it home for nothing.
If I give you a battery free of charge, a


63
0:8:12,61 --> 0:8:19,419
mind free of charge sometimes it's a brain
hit by lightening, it so saturates everything


64
0:8:19,419 --> 0:8:27,919
so the guy doesn't know he's even there. The
brain's been shocked into nonassociative systems.


65
0:8:27,919 --> 0:8:36,589
That can happen, or the brain can be partially
shocked, into no association systems. Then


66
0:8:36,589 --> 0:8:45,3
there's such a thing as neurotoxins - poisons
in the brain, that make it unable to operate,


67
0:8:45,3 --> 0:8:52,5
and there's conditioning that makes the brain
unable to operate, it's hard to tell the difference,


68
0:8:52,5 --> 0:8:59,449
because neurotoxins can stop the brain from
operating and a guy brought up in a thalamic


69
0:8:59,449 --> 0:9:5,94
country - you know what that means? emotional
only, and he only gets angry when people don't


70
0:9:5,94 --> 0:9:12,769
do what he asked them to do - 'I told you
to cook the chicken' you know and they get


71
0:9:12,769 --> 0:9:20,529
angry, that means you didn't affect their
behavior the way you wanted to, you know you


72
0:9:20,529 --> 0:9:23,779
can't say to kids 'I want you to listen to
every word I say' he can't even hear the words


73
0:9:23,779 --> 0:9:31,579
you say, unless you tell him what the words
mean. So you've got a much bigger job than


74
0:9:31,579 --> 0:9:39,779
you think, it isn't just saying 'now you listen
to me, I'll tell you the truth' you can't


75
0:9:39,779 --> 0:9:46,19
walk over to a judge and say 'everything you
do is based on ignorance' he says 'how do


76
0:9:46,19 --> 0:9:52,91
you see that? How do you mean that?' - I say,
if you ever run into a judge that talks that


77
0:9:52,91 --> 0:10:1,3
way, you're half way there. I've never met
a person who says 'how do you mean that?'


78
0:10:1,3 --> 0:10:8,62
you know. So if you say to a judge 'everything
you do is erroneous, unreal, you might as


79
0:10:8,62 --> 0:10:11,769
well be a head-hunter. You're putting people
in jail, you're judging people, you know nothing


80
0:10:11,769 --> 0:10:14,22
about their background' he says 'I know plenty
about their background! He's a criminal, he's


81
0:10:14,22 --> 0:10:21,93
been in jail before' that's his yard stake
 - associative memory. So all our actions


82
0:10:21,93 --> 0:10:30,4
are based on associative memory, do you understand
what that means? Your experience. Not the


83
0:10:30,4 --> 0:10:37,57
truth. When a person says 'I'd like to know
the truth about something. Does the universe


84
0:10:37,57 --> 0:10:46,63
change?' and another person might say 'at
what rate does it change?' you know, you can


85
0:10:46,63 --> 0:10:53,87
take a camera and a telescope and photograph
the universe every 2 hours and the stars will


86
0:10:53,87 --> 0:10:58,37
move to different positions, but normally
looking at it, all the stars appear to be


87
0:10:58,37 --> 0:11:6,889
fixed. So even that time frame camera, if
set to photograph every month, the planets


88
0:11:6,889 --> 0:11:15,42
will move a great deal, so you can record
and say - when you're scientific, you can


89
0:11:15,42 --> 0:11:22,36
say 'within 12 minutes, this is what we get.
Within 40 minutes, this is what we get' -


90
0:11:22,36 --> 0:11:31,5
 'which is the right one?' - that doesn't
make sense. If you photograph an automobile


91
0:11:31,5 --> 0:11:37,509
with an ordinary camera, the wheels appear
to be turning backwards, have you ever noticed


92
0:11:37,509 --> 0:11:44,949
that on cars? On a motion picture? Well if
you can sync your camera, with real events


93
0:11:44,949 --> 0:11:52,47
in real time, you can get the wheels to appear
to turn in the right direction. So, all knowledge


94
0:11:52,47 --> 0:12:1,269
is based upon time, when a chemist looks at
something, he looks at it as a chemist. When


95
0:12:1,269 --> 0:12:7,829
a writer listens to a person he listens for
story, what he feels would be commercially


96
0:12:7,829 --> 0:12:13,83
saleable. When a sales man looks at person,
he's looking at something entirely different


97
0:12:13,83 --> 0:12:23,449
 - 'Can I sell you a lawn mower?' Now, it
seems to me that if you were to tell the average


98
0:12:23,449 --> 0:12:30,31
person, if you had a city of 10,000 people,
and they all chipped in 10 bucks a piece and


99
0:12:30,31 --> 0:12:35,31
built a community bank, and all the profit
went to that city, he should lap onto that


100
0:12:35,31 --> 0:12:43,31
cause that makes sense. You know what I mean?
If it was a community owned bank and all the


101
0:12:43,31 --> 0:12:49,69
profit went to everybody, if the community
of 10,000 people chipped in 10 bucks a piece,


102
0:12:49,69 --> 0:12:57,29
and bought a farm, food would be much less
for everybody. So, when they say 'that sounds


103
0:12:57,29 --> 0:13:3,61
like communism' that doesn't deal with anything,
the person's not addressing the subject. What's


104
0:13:3,61 --> 0:13:11,589
wrong with a community bank? He says 'it'll
kill incentive' - have you ever tried it?


105
0:13:11,589 --> 0:13:21,199
'No' - then how do you know it'll kill incentive?
You know, you're always wrestling with people.


106
0:13:21,199 --> 0:13:29,67
So, if you got 4,000 houses or say 300 houses
and each 1 buys a lawnmower, if you bought


107
0:13:29,67 --> 0:13:35,459
6 gigantic lawnmowers and mow the whole area,
it'd be better than selling a lawnmower to


108
0:13:35,459 --> 0:13:42,94
every house, but it's better for business,
but collectivism is obviously better than


109
0:13:42,94 --> 0:13:52,199
any other system. So people say to me - or
I’ve been reading anti utopian books, it


110
0:13:52,199 --> 0:14:0,129
says 'man doesn't stay fixed, he's changing'
well it depends on the rate of change, man


111
0:14:0,129 --> 0:14:6,87
they say can’t be controlled because he’s
not a fixed entity, when you see all these


112
0:14:6,87 --> 0:14:14,3
Chinese marching together in North Korea,
they march like 1 unit, and we did 2,000 plane


113
0:14:14,3 --> 0:14:21,5
raids over Germany, how'd you get 2,000 planes
off the ground without making them very uniform?


114
0:14:21,5 --> 0:14:30,1
You know what I mean? Now, what degree of
uniformity can you attain with people? It


115
0:14:30,1 --> 0:14:39,4
depends on how sophisticated your equipment
is. Now, when they say 'is there a place for


116
0:14:39,4 --> 0:14:44,72
individuality?' when you say to me 'if a guy
likes to fuck frogs, would there be a place


117
0:14:44,72 --> 0:14:50,569
for him?' What do you mean by individuality?
I don’t know what they're talking about,


118
0:14:50,569 --> 0:14:56,68
I know what they think they're talking about,
'will they be free?' they’re never free,


119
0:14:56,68 --> 0:15:4,329
you can't be free of your background, you
speak in some language always, Japanese, Chinese,


120
0:15:4,329 --> 0:15:13,279
but you can't be free. If a guy comes up and
he says '[UNKNOWN] - I'm an individualist'


121
0:15:13,279 --> 0:15:18,98
that's what that means, it means he doesn't
respond as you do, well you can’t deal with


122
0:15:18,98 --> 0:15:26,0
him if he doesn't. You can’t make any deals,
you can’t get any behavioral cooperation.


123
0:15:26,0 --> 0:15:33,649
So, the Zeitgeist Movement should be a system
that indoctrinates people to a working system,


124
0:15:33,649 --> 0:17:33,649
that's beneficial to most people.
