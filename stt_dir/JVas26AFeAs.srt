SHANE SMITH: So after traveling
across Siberia on


5
0:0:14,49 --> 0:0:17,41
one train, deep into the middle
of nowhere, we switched


6
0:0:17,41 --> 0:0:20,11
to another train going
even deeper into


7
0:0:20,11 --> 0:0:21,44
the middle of nowhere.


8
0:0:21,44 --> 0:0:24,48
And finally, after two and a
half very drunken days on the


9
0:0:24,48 --> 0:0:27,29
train, we arrived in Tynda,
where the North Korean


10
0:0:27,29 --> 0:0:28,762
administrative camp was.


11
0:0:28,762 --> 0:0:36,97



12
0:0:36,97 --> 0:0:39,28
So we just got to Tynda.


13
0:0:39,28 --> 0:0:43,8
Some say it's the worst town
in all of Russia--


14
0:0:43,8 --> 0:0:44,44
the most depressing.


15
0:0:44,44 --> 0:0:48,2
And we're actually going to try
to go to the office that


16
0:0:48,2 --> 0:0:51,95
runs all the North Koreans in
the region and see if we can


17
0:0:51,95 --> 0:0:53,2
ask them some questions.


18
0:0:53,2 --> 0:0:59,18



19
0:0:59,18 --> 0:1:1,92
We met this cop on the train.


20
0:1:1,92 --> 0:1:3,5
He seemed liked a nice guy.


21
0:1:3,5 --> 0:1:7,11
He got the thugs away from us
when things got a bit drunk-y.


22
0:1:7,11 --> 0:1:10,22
And so then he's offered to
help us, which is good.


23
0:1:10,22 --> 0:1:12,54
Because when we went to the
hotel to check in, we


24
0:1:12,54 --> 0:1:13,26
didn't check in.


25
0:1:13,26 --> 0:1:13,63
Why?


26
0:1:13,63 --> 0:1:18,86
Because the FSB, who used to be
the KGB, are asking about


27
0:1:18,86 --> 0:1:21,41
us, saying, let us know
when they check in.


28
0:1:21,41 --> 0:1:23,65
So the lady said, I'll let them
know, but I'm letting you


29
0:1:23,65 --> 0:1:25,25
know that I'm letting
them know.


30
0:1:25,25 --> 0:1:27,42
So we're like, OK, we won't
be staying there.


31
0:1:27,42 --> 0:1:30,37
So we stayed in an apartment
where the water


32
0:1:30,37 --> 0:1:31,49
smelled like gasoline.


33
0:1:31,49 --> 0:1:34,11
And now we have a cop that we're
going to bring with us,


34
0:1:34,11 --> 0:1:37,755
so we seem more official when we
go meet the North Koreans.


35
0:1:37,755 --> 0:1:51,26



36
0:1:51,26 --> 0:1:53,55
We just got here, and
we see posters


37
0:1:53,55 --> 0:1:55,51
of Kim Il-Sung already.


38
0:1:55,51 --> 0:1:58,85
And also it says here that they
will lay their lives down


39
0:1:58,85 --> 0:2:3,2
for the revolution of the great
leader, Kim Jong-Il.


40
0:2:3,2 --> 0:2:4,72
What are we waiting
for, by the way?


41
0:2:4,72 --> 0:2:6,58
SIMON OSTROVSKY: For one of
the bosses of the camp.


42
0:2:6,58 --> 0:2:9,138
SHANE SMITH: Look, he's got,
like, a Kim Il-Sung pin and


43
0:2:9,138 --> 0:2:11,114
everything.

Koreans don't want us to go


66
0:3:35,24 --> 0:3:36,44
into the North Korean camp?


67
0:3:36,44 --> 0:3:37,92
SIMON OSTROVSKY: They don't
want to go into the north


68
0:3:37,92 --> 0:3:38,55
Korean camp.


69
0:3:38,55 --> 0:3:39,8

very surprising.


70
0:3:39,8 --> 0:3:44,95



71
0:3:44,95 --> 0:3:48,14
So we came out here to the
outskirts of Tynda and we


72
0:3:48,14 --> 0:3:49,24
found the North Korean


73
0:3:49,24 --> 0:3:51,68
Administration Camp Number Two.


74
0:3:51,68 --> 0:3:53,31
Surprise, surprise, they
won't let us in.


75
0:3:53,31 --> 0:3:56,33
But we're going to go deeper
into the interior to find the


76
0:3:56,33 --> 0:3:58,86
actual work camps and
see if we can talk


77
0:3:58,86 --> 0:4:0,11
to some of the dudes.


78
0:4:0,11 --> 0:4:3,44



79
0:4:3,44 --> 0:4:7,4
So we're leaving on a one-car
train to go to the north


80
0:4:7,4 --> 0:4:8,6

81
0:4:8,6 --> 0:4:9,95
It's a one-car train.


82

That goes into the middle
of nowhere.

breaking in to the North
Korean camp.

getting caught
