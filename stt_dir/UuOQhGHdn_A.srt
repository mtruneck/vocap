didn't know that much about


8
0:0:43,5 --> 0:0:46,14

But when we did more research,
we found out that, oh, Kim


15
0:1:2,937 --> 0:1:6,334
Jong Il is a huge film buff.


16
0:1:6,334 --> 0:1:8,205
He has over 20,000 titles.


17
0:1:8,205 --> 0:1:11,67
He built seven personal, private
theaters, and he loves


18
0:1:11,67 --> 0:1:16,64
slasher films, Godzilla movies,
and Elizabeth Taylor.


19
0:1:16,64 --> 0:1:21,0
In fact, he loves film so much
that he built a huge studio

nation's capital, Pyongyang.


21

Kim Jong Il came to power
in 1993 after the


28
0:1:53,79 --> 0:1:54,97
death of his father.


29
0:1:54,97 --> 0:1:58,89
His father, Kim Il Song was
the first ruler, slash


30
0:1:58,89 --> 0:2:2,72
Generalissimo of North Korea.


31
0:2:2,72 --> 0:2:5,93
Kim Jong Il made a film about
his dad, which helped sort of


32
0:2:5,93 --> 0:2:9,93
smooth and solidify his move
into power to become the next

Kim Jong Il is known to his

He's perfect at all arts,
especially film.

0:2:31,57 --> 0:2:34,96
In fact, he wrote
a book about it.


43
0:2:34,96 --> 0:2:37,55
So Kim Jong Il builds this huge
film studio in the middle


44
0:2:37,55 --> 0:2:39,39
of Pyongyang, but
he doesn't have


45
0:2:39,39 --> 0:2:40,68

get out of North Korea, we


50
0:3:6,2 --> 0:3:8,91
were trying to get in, which
is no easy task.


51
0:3:8,91 --> 0:3:11,43
And it took us about a year
and a half of continual


52
0:3:11,43 --> 0:3:14,5
nagging and calling before we
got a tentative OK to come to


53
0:3:14,5 --> 0:3:18,125
Northern China in Shenyang and
apply in person at the North


54
0:3:18,125 --> 0:3:23,215

to get into North Korea.


55
0:3:23,215 --> 0:3:24,48
They pick you up.


56
0:3:24,48 --> 0:3:25,71
They put you in a car.


57
0:3:25,71 --> 0:3:26,415
They take your passport.


58
0:3:26,415 --> 0:3:27,385
They take your money.


59
0:3:27,385 --> 0:3:32,56
And they drop you off in
a North Korean bar.


60
0:3:32,56 --> 0:3:34,47
You're in this North Korean bar,
and they're singing these


61
0:3:34,47 --> 0:3:36,11
propaganda songs right away.


62
0:3:36,11 --> 0:3:38,7
And if wasn't for my buddy Mark
from the LA Times-- thank


63
0:3:38,7 --> 0:3:41,2
you Mark-- who twigged me to the
fact that everybody in the


64
0:3:41,2 --> 0:3:44,14
bar is secret police, and if
you don't show the proper


65
0:3:44,14 --> 0:3:46,43
enthusiasm for the propaganda
songs, you're not


66
0:3:46,43 --> 0:3:47,2
going to get in.


67
0:3:47,2 --> 0:3:50,35
So I drank blueberry wine, got
pissed, got up, started


68
0:3:50,35 --> 0:3:52,27
singing the songs as
best as I could.

get you right away.

only one floor being used.

0:4:42,1 --> 0:4:45,1
You go into the lobby, and
it's totally empty.


86

take you is to the DMZ.
