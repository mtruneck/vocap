RYAN DUFFY: Today, we meet a web
personality that you may


3
0:0:2,17 --> 0:0:4,59
remember from the Elf and the
Glory Hole, and we get some


4
0:0:4,59 --> 0:0:6,1
more tips on staying classy.


5
0:0:6,1 --> 0:0:11,32



6
0:0:11,32 --> 0:0:14,46
GRACE HELBIG: When I was
younger, I wanted to be in the


7
0:0:14,46 --> 0:0:15,86
Swim With the Dolphins
program.


8
0:0:15,86 --> 0:0:17,84
I also wanted to be
a veterinarian.


9
0:0:17,84 --> 0:0:19,89
I wanted to be an
Olympic gymnast.


10
0:0:19,89 --> 0:0:22,8
I wanted to be a professional
horseback rider.


11
0:0:22,8 --> 0:0:27,44
The idea of making money on the
internet was nowhere in my


12
0:0:27,44 --> 0:0:29,85
brain ever as a possibility.


13
0:0:29,85 --> 0:0:31,37
No way.


14
0:0:31,37 --> 0:0:33,51
Well, it was confusing because
every time I told my parents


15
0:0:33,51 --> 0:0:36,7
that I make web videos, my
mom thought it was porn.


16
0:0:36,7 --> 0:0:37,998
Welcome to the internet!


17
0:0:37,998 --> 0:0:44,12



18
0:0:44,12 --> 0:0:44,79
Hi.


19
0:0:44,79 --> 0:0:48,67
I'm Grace Helbig, but on the
internet, I go by Daily Grace.


20
0:0:48,67 --> 0:0:51,95
I host My Damn Channel Live
Thursdays, and I have a daily


21
0:0:51,95 --> 0:0:53,315
vlog called Daily Grace.


22
0:0:53,315 --> 0:0:57,15



23
0:0:57,15 --> 0:0:58,915
Byeee!


24
0:0:58,915 --> 0:0:59,4
[RECORD SCRATCH]


25
0:0:59,4 --> 0:1:1,65
GRACE HELBIG: I think it's
time for some ass play.


26
0:1:1,65 --> 0:1:5,53
So I grew up in beautiful,
beautiful South Jersey.


27
0:1:5,53 --> 0:1:8,47
But I grew up in a family
of brothers.


28
0:1:8,47 --> 0:1:11,33
I have two brothers and
three stepbrothers.


29
0:1:11,33 --> 0:1:17,12
And I really thought they were
the funniest people in the


30
0:1:17,12 --> 0:1:18,11
entire world.


31
0:1:18,11 --> 0:1:21,59
I remember one day on a car
ride, I was doing an


32
0:1:21,59 --> 0:1:24,7
impersonation of Cartman
from South Park.


33
0:1:24,7 --> 0:1:25,632
That's Kenny's creamed corn.


34
0:1:25,632 --> 0:1:26,988
CARTMAN FROM SOUTH PARK: And
you will respect mah


35
0:1:26,988 --> 0:1:28,35
authoritah.


36
0:1:28,35 --> 0:1:30,59
GRACE HELBIG: Doesn't sound
anything like Cartman, but


37
0:1:30,59 --> 0:1:32,24
they loved it.


38
0:1:32,24 --> 0:1:35,543
And the one day that I did make
them laugh was the day I


39
0:1:35,543 --> 0:1:41,61
was like, so validated and was
on such a pursuit to keep that


40
0:1:41,61 --> 0:1:43,14
feeling going.


41
0:1:43,14 --> 0:1:45,67
Michelle and I lived together
senior year and then moved to


42
0:1:45,67 --> 0:1:48,45
Brooklyn together after
we graduated.


43
0:1:48,45 --> 0:1:48,9
MICHELLE VARGAS: Hello.


44
0:1:48,9 --> 0:1:49,44
GRACE HELBIG: Hi.


45
0:1:49,44 --> 0:1:49,95
MICHELLE VARGAS: I'm Michelle.


46
0:1:49,95 --> 0:1:50,3
GRACE HELBIG: I'm Grace.


47
0:1:50,3 --> 0:1:52,39
MICHELLE VARGAS: And we're
GraceNMichelle.


48
0:1:52,39 --> 0:1:52,84
GRACE HELBIG: What?


49
0:1:52,84 --> 0:1:53,175
MICHELLE VARGAS: What?


50
0:1:53,175 --> 0:1:54,555
GRACE HELBIG: Welcome
to the brand new--


51
0:1:54,555 --> 0:1:58,7
GRACE N MICHELLE: Totally
T1tz Tuesday!


52
0:1:58,7 --> 0:2:0,96
GRACE HELBIG: So when I moved
to Brooklyn, Michelle and I


53
0:2:0,96 --> 0:2:4,12
were doing our GraceNMichelle.


54
0:2:4,12 --> 0:2:6,72
and I was working for Viacom
at the time in project


55
0:2:6,72 --> 0:2:8,91
management, all while
doing improv at the


56
0:2:8,91 --> 0:2:10,49
People's Improv Theater.


57
0:2:10,49 --> 0:2:13,69
And I am not good at
managing projects.


58
0:2:13,69 --> 0:2:16,71
And I also wanted to really
pursue a more creative


59
0:2:16,71 --> 0:2:18,41
lifestyle than sitting
behind a desk.


60
0:2:18,41 --> 0:2:19,61
So I quit.


61
0:2:19,61 --> 0:2:21,53
GRACENMICHELLE: That's great!


62
0:2:21,53 --> 0:2:23,27
GRACE HELBIG: How do you
say it in Spanish?


63
0:2:23,27 --> 0:2:24,37
Tittays?


64
0:2:24,37 --> 0:2:27,4
And through the theater I got
a casting call for a web


65
0:2:27,4 --> 0:2:29,24
series called Bedtime Stories.


66
0:2:29,24 --> 0:2:33,43
That was the first thing in New
York that I ever booked.


67
0:2:33,43 --> 0:2:36,66
GRACE HELBIG: Hansel
and Gretel.


68
0:2:36,66 --> 0:2:38,44
Hansel noticed the witch
walked kind of


69
0:2:38,44 --> 0:2:39,615
funny and took a shot.


70
0:2:39,615 --> 0:2:42,27
Do you suffer from
vaginal dryness?


71
0:2:42,27 --> 0:2:43,73
Why, yes, that's true.


72
0:2:43,73 --> 0:2:47,35
Hansel removed a tube from his
pocket and said, then Lubricil


73
0:2:47,35 --> 0:2:48,55
may be the answer.


74
0:2:48,55 --> 0:2:51,305
Come back next time when you'll
hear the fable of the


75
0:2:51,305 --> 0:2:53,85
Elf and the Glory Hole.


76
0:2:53,85 --> 0:2:55,96
I didn't realize that it was
a web series going up on


77
0:2:55,96 --> 0:2:57,57
MyDamnChannel.com.


78
0:2:57,57 --> 0:3:0,98
And Rob Barnett, the CEO of My
Damn Channel, called me in and


79
0:3:0,98 --> 0:3:3,89
said, we want someone
to host our website.

81
0:3:5,294 --> 0:3:9,98



82
0:3:9,98 --> 0:3:11,89
GRACE HELBIG: If you guys missed
yesterday's show with


83
0:3:11,89 --> 0:3:14,59
Michael Showalter,
here's a clip.


84
0:3:14,59 --> 0:3:16,88
MICHAEL SHOWALTER: What do
you think about Skittles?


85
0:3:16,88 --> 0:3:17,67
BETH HOYT: I have nothing.


86
0:3:17,67 --> 0:3:19,4
I just, I had some today.


87
0:3:19,4 --> 0:3:20,9
MICHAEL SHOWALTER: You
had Skittles today?


88
0:3:20,9 --> 0:3:20,456
BETH HOYT: Yeah.


89
0:3:20,456 --> 0:3:21,79
I didn't buy them.


90
0:3:21,79 --> 0:3:24,23
They were just in front of me,
and I would never refuse a


91
0:3:24,23 --> 0:3:24,95
bowl of Skittles.


92
0:3:24,95 --> 0:3:27,34
I like the sound of the
clink-clink of the Skittles.


93
0:3:27,34 --> 0:3:27,89
What about you?


94
0:3:27,89 --> 0:3:28,94
MICHAEL SHOWALTER:
Skittles make a


95
0:3:28,94 --> 0:3:31,23
lovely clink-clink sound.


96
0:3:31,23 --> 0:3:34,28
GRACE HELBIG: They do make a
lovely clink-clink sound.


97
0:3:34,28 --> 0:3:36,44
So it's not just, here's
a bunch of content.


98
0:3:36,44 --> 0:3:36,96
Watch it.


99
0:3:36,96 --> 0:3:40,23
Instead it'd be me, going,
hey, what'd you


100
0:3:40,23 --> 0:3:41,13
guys think of this?


101
0:3:41,13 --> 0:3:42,7
What'd you think of this?


102
0:3:42,7 --> 0:3:44,63
Let's have an internet dialogue
with each other.


103
0:3:44,63 --> 0:3:47,42
A coworker doesn't seem to
understand the concept of


104
0:3:47,42 --> 0:3:48,24
personal space.


105
0:3:48,24 --> 0:3:50,6
How do I tell him
to step back?


106
0:3:50,6 --> 0:3:51,13
OK.


107
0:3:51,13 --> 0:3:53,0
This is my suggestion to you.


108
0:3:53,0 --> 0:3:57,4
You get up real close to him,
super-duper close--


109
0:3:57,4 --> 0:3:58,8
well, he's already probably
close to you.


110
0:3:58,8 --> 0:4:2,37
You just say, listen, friend.


111
0:4:2,37 --> 0:4:6,984
I have unpredictable
diarrhea right now.


112
0:4:6,984 --> 0:4:11,13



113
0:4:11,13 --> 0:4:15,85
Do your farts smell as
good as you look?


114
0:4:15,85 --> 0:4:17,459
No.


115
0:4:17,459 --> 0:4:18,88
No, they don't.


116
0:4:18,88 --> 0:4:20,31
And then it grew.


117
0:4:20,31 --> 0:4:23,72
Four years later, I'm making
a video every day.


118
0:4:23,72 --> 0:4:26,59
I get to do my own comedy
pieces every day.


119
0:4:26,59 --> 0:4:29,695
I write, shoot, edit all
of it myself from home.


120
0:4:29,695 --> 0:4:33,834



121
0:4:33,834 --> 0:4:36,702
These are business expenses.


122
0:4:36,702 --> 0:4:39,31
A lot of my day is just
sitting around


123
0:4:39,31 --> 0:4:40,56
playing with toys.


124
0:4:40,56 --> 0:4:44,0



125
0:4:44,0 --> 0:4:45,5
What is Grace at home?


126
0:4:45,5 --> 0:4:49,75
Grace at home is pretty mellow,
pretty low-key.

0:4:49,75 --> 0:4:51,69
Until this guy goes on.


128
0:4:51,69 --> 0:4:54,97
And then shit goes crazy.

0:4:54,97 --> 0:4:56,13
There's my face.


130
0:4:56,13 --> 0:4:56,84

0:5:10,91 --> 0:5:16,11

saw the Jim Carrey vlog


140
0:5:16,11 --> 0:5:18,38
proclaiming his love
for Emma Stone.


141
0:5:18,38 --> 0:5:21,24
This is a message
for Pat Sajak.


142
0:5:21,24 --> 0:5:22,356
Pat.


143
0:5:22,356 --> 0:5:28,462
Can I buy a your dick
in my vagina?


144
0:5:28,462 --> 0:5:30,454
I'd like to solve the puzzle.

0:5:30,454 --> 0:5:30,952

146
0:5:30,952 --> 0:5:32,95
me.


147
0:5:32,95 --> 0:5:35,46
The internet is great
because--


148
0:5:35,46 --> 0:5:36,18
the reach.


149
0:5:36,18 --> 0:5:40,89
It can just reach so many
people at one time.


150
0:5:40,89 --> 0:5:43,3
I could never do that
on a stage at the


151
0:5:43,3 --> 0:5:44,6
People's Improv Theater.


152
0:5:44,6 --> 0:5:47,81
I can reach 100 people,
maybe, at that stage.


153
0:5:47,81 --> 0:5:52,1
But I can reach 100,000 people
when I post a video every day.


154
0:5:52,1 --> 0:5:57,54
They appreciate the work that
I put into it so thoroughly.


155
0:5:57,54 --> 0:6:2,5
I just got a PO box a little
while ago, so people send fan


156
0:6:2,5 --> 0:6:3,68
art and all kinds of stuff.


157
0:6:3,68 --> 0:6:3,852
Yeah.


158
0:6:3,852 --> 0:6:6,656
People are so talented,
and it's crazy.


159
0:6:6,656 --> 0:6:7,91
It's so crazy.


160
0:6:7,91 --> 0:6:10,2
These kids are insanely
talented.


161
0:6:10,2 --> 0:6:10,53
And look.


162
0:6:10,53 --> 0:6:11,452
Look at that.


163
0:6:11,452 --> 0:6:13,3
That's insane.


164
0:6:13,3 --> 0:6:16,95
I make web videos, and then
people make this.


165
0:6:16,95 --> 0:6:17,385
What?


166
0:6:17,385 --> 0:6:19,23
Crazy.


167
0:6:19,23 --> 0:6:19,607
Hey, guys.


168
0:6:19,607 --> 0:6:23,0
It's Friday here on Daily
Grace, and you


169
0:6:23,0 --> 0:6:24,38
know what that means.


170
0:6:24,38 --> 0:6:25,31
Sexy Friday.


171
0:6:25,31 --> 0:6:26,64
Sexy Friday.


172
0:6:26,64 --> 0:6:27,39
Sexy Friday.


173
0:6:27,39 --> 0:6:33,45
It's a lot of teenage girls
that don't want to be the


174
0:6:33,45 --> 0:6:34,67
pretty, vapid girl.


175
0:6:34,67 --> 0:6:37,56
They like being awkward or
silly or weird or funny.


176
0:6:37,56 --> 0:6:41,84
And I want to keep them feeling
like they should do


177
0:6:41,84 --> 0:6:45,19
that, and that there is a place
for that, and it's fun


178
0:6:45,19 --> 0:6:47,32
to be that way, and to just
enjoy themselves.


179
0:6:47,32 --> 0:6:48,83
So I think--


180
0:6:48,83 --> 0:6:50,57
it sounds cheesy, but the thing
that I want to do is


181
0:6:50,57 --> 0:6:55,856
just to keep these girls feeling
good about themselves.


182
0:6:55,856 --> 0:6:56,348

you how to get from point A to

point B without looking like a
complete and total dipshit in

with John Martin.

0:7:13,995 --> 0:7:19,72



193
0:7:19,72 --> 0:7:23,0
JOHN MARTIN: Here are some
rules for airport travel.


194
0:7:23,0 --> 0:7:26,47
When you're in an airport, you
always walk fast, to the left,


195
0:7:26,47 --> 0:7:28,86
on moving sidewalks
and escalators.


196
0:7:28,86 --> 0:7:30,62
Know those people
on the right?


197
0:7:30,62 --> 0:7:32,53
People in sweat pants.


198
0:7:32,53 --> 0:7:37,37
Or velour pants.


199
0:7:37,37 --> 0:7:39,55
Those are what failed
businessmen become


200
0:7:39,55 --> 0:7:41,49
when they have kids.


201
0:7:41,49 --> 0:7:42,74
Those are their kids.


202
0:7:42,74 --> 0:7:47,38



203
0:7:47,38 --> 0:7:48,63
Dropped an ice.


204
0:7:48,63 --> 0:7:52,49



205
0:7:52,49 --> 0:7:55,39
Spend $400 a year on a
decent credit card.


206
0:7:55,39 --> 0:7:56,87
It'll get you in the
airport lounge.


207
0:7:56,87 --> 0:7:59,51
And the beauty of that is
it'll get you away from


208
0:7:59,51 --> 0:8:1,9
numbskull Floridians with
low-hanging pants.


209
0:8:1,9 --> 0:8:4,15
No one wants to look at that as
