0:0:13,1 --> 0:0:15,96
CHRISTOPHER ANDERSON: I'm still
endlessly fascinated by


3
0:0:15,96 --> 0:0:19,77
what is that magic dust that,
sprinkled on a certain image,


4
0:0:19,77 --> 0:0:22,85
makes it more powerful
than another image?


5
0:0:22,85 --> 0:0:27,79
It goes so far beyond
composition and lighting all


6
0:0:27,79 --> 0:0:28,72
those things.


7
0:0:28,72 --> 0:0:31,93
But yet, it's kind of all those
things mixed together.


8
0:0:31,93 --> 0:0:35,98
And that's the essence of what
is interesting about


9
0:0:35,98 --> 0:0:37,23
photography to me.


10
0:0:37,23 --> 0:0:45,82



11
0:0:45,82 --> 0:0:47,88
Oh man, I love when the
city looks like that.


12
0:0:47,88 --> 0:0:52,73



13
0:0:52,73 --> 0:0:54,9
My name is Christopher
Anderson,


14
0:0:54,9 --> 0:0:58,65
full member in Magnum.


15
0:0:58,65 --> 0:1:2,94
There was a certain idea, the
notion that this camera could


16
0:1:2,94 --> 0:1:6,71
represent for me, especially
growing up in a


17
0:1:6,71 --> 0:1:8,51
small town in Texas.


18
0:1:8,51 --> 0:1:14,75
This little machine represented
a way out.


19
0:1:14,75 --> 0:1:19,69
So there was that sense of
having an idea of wanting to


20
0:1:19,69 --> 0:1:21,56
do something with this.


21
0:1:21,56 --> 0:1:24,7
But what that really meant
of being a professional--


22
0:1:24,7 --> 0:1:27,29
no.


23
0:1:27,29 --> 0:1:29,9
When I got out of university,
I was


24
0:1:29,9 --> 0:1:32,8
planning to go into academia.


25
0:1:32,8 --> 0:1:35,67
But a friend of my family got
me a job in "The Dallas


26
0:1:35,67 --> 0:1:38,0
Morning News" printing
pictures and


27
0:1:38,0 --> 0:1:39,65
developing film there.


28
0:1:39,65 --> 0:1:42,76
I did that as a summer job, and
I knew then I wanted to be


29
0:1:42,76 --> 0:1:43,8
a photographer somehow.


30
0:1:43,8 --> 0:1:47,21
And I was never going to
go back to academia.


31
0:1:47,21 --> 0:1:48,32
I got really lucky.


32
0:1:48,32 --> 0:1:52,75
Someone gave me a job to take
pictures before I even really


33
0:1:52,75 --> 0:1:55,71
understood that there was
a job description of


34
0:1:55,71 --> 0:1:57,69
professional photographer.


35
0:1:57,69 --> 0:1:59,32
I had no formal training.


36
0:1:59,32 --> 0:2:1,59
I really didn't know how
to work a camera.


37
0:2:1,59 --> 0:2:4,14
I certainly had no journalism
training.


38
0:2:4,14 --> 0:2:8,96
I became this professional
and learned on the job.


39
0:2:8,96 --> 0:2:13,41
And I spent many years just
trying to do my job as good as


40
0:2:13,41 --> 0:2:16,94
I could do it before I ever
start really thinking about


41
0:2:16,94 --> 0:2:21,8
putting very basic questions
to myself, like what is a


42
0:2:21,8 --> 0:2:21,435
photograph?


43
0:2:21,435 --> 0:2:25,9
And what do I want my
photographs to represent?


44
0:2:25,9 --> 0:2:28,37
Those sort of questions
came to me much later.


45
0:2:28,37 --> 0:2:31,45



46
0:2:31,45 --> 0:2:32,77
Here's the Haiti boat story--


47
0:2:32,77 --> 0:2:36,7



48
0:2:36,7 --> 0:2:40,6
June 18, 2000.


49
0:2:40,6 --> 0:2:42,85
In Haiti, this writer and I--


50
0:2:42,85 --> 0:2:44,3
Michael Finkel--


51
0:2:44,3 --> 0:2:49,74
met this guy in Haiti who told
us an amazing story about


52
0:2:49,74 --> 0:2:54,22
trying to get on a boat and
sail to the United States.


53
0:2:54,22 --> 0:2:56,29
We got on one of these boats--


54
0:2:56,29 --> 0:3:0,2
44 Haitians plus myself
and the writer.


55
0:3:0,2 --> 0:3:3,62
And we set sail.


56
0:3:3,62 --> 0:3:6,18



57
0:3:6,18 --> 0:3:9,47
And a few days later,
we started sinking.


58
0:3:9,47 --> 0:3:12,0
That moment in the boat
when we realized


59
0:3:12,0 --> 0:3:13,54
that we were sinking---


60
0:3:13,54 --> 0:3:17,87
up until that point, I hadn't
taken many photographs.


61
0:3:17,87 --> 0:3:23,44
And the guy we were with, David,
says, Chris, you'd


62
0:3:23,44 --> 0:3:24,85
better start taking
pictures now.


63
0:3:24,85 --> 0:3:27,33
We're going to be dead
in 45 minutes.


64
0:3:27,33 --> 0:3:30,28
Without thinking too much
about it, I begin making


65
0:3:30,28 --> 0:3:33,71
photographs, as we were
literally saying goodbye to


66
0:3:33,71 --> 0:3:34,96
each other.


67
0:3:34,96 --> 0:3:37,4



68
0:3:37,4 --> 0:3:38,34
This is the guy, David.


69
0:3:38,34 --> 0:3:43,12
That was the moment we realized
we were sinking.


70
0:3:43,12 --> 0:3:44,73
You can see the water
coming in from the


71
0:3:44,73 --> 0:3:45,98
inside of the boat there.


72
0:3:45,98 --> 0:3:48,63



73
0:3:48,63 --> 0:3:54,23
And later on, after that, I
thought about that moment over


74
0:3:54,23 --> 0:3:59,79
and over again, asking myself
the question, why make


75
0:3:59,79 --> 0:4:3,31
photographs that I assumed
no one would see?


76
0:4:3,31 --> 0:4:8,5
And the only answer that I could
come up with was that


77
0:4:8,5 --> 0:4:11,77
the actual act of making
pictures, photography in and


78
0:4:11,77 --> 0:4:16,72
of itself, it had as much to do
for me about explaining the


79
0:4:16,72 --> 0:4:21,12
world to myself as it did
explaining it to someone else.


80
0:4:21,12 --> 0:4:24,83
The very act of photography
was part of how


81
0:4:24,83 --> 0:4:27,32
I understood things.


82
0:4:27,32 --> 0:4:36,68
It crystallized the notion,
the idea of what it was I


83
0:4:36,68 --> 0:4:38,85
thought about photography
and what I


84
0:4:38,85 --> 0:4:42,7
wanted to do with pictures.


85
0:4:42,7 --> 0:4:43,32
It changed everything.


86
0:4:43,32 --> 0:4:54,24



87
0:4:54,24 --> 0:4:58,78
And from that point, I guess
editors thought that I was


88
0:4:58,78 --> 0:5:3,97
looking for danger and was
willing to go through some


89
0:5:3,97 --> 0:5:6,44
discomfort.


90
0:5:6,44 --> 0:5:9,2
So I started getting offers to
do the obvious thing, which is


91
0:5:9,2 --> 0:5:10,57
go to wars.


92
0:5:10,57 --> 0:5:14,79
And that set about-- the next
several years was this kind of


93
0:5:14,79 --> 0:5:22,38
blur from Israel, Palestine to
Lebanon to Africa to Iraq,


94
0:5:22,38 --> 0:5:24,4
Afghanistan.


95
0:5:24,4 --> 0:5:27,78
But with a clear idea
of what I wanted the


96
0:5:27,78 --> 0:5:30,5
pictures to be about.


97
0:5:30,5 --> 0:5:35,25
I wanted to find a way for
someone to feel what it was


98
0:5:35,25 --> 0:5:37,6
that I experienced--


99
0:5:37,6 --> 0:5:43,42
an emotional quality that cut
through all the ideas of facts


100
0:5:43,42 --> 0:5:46,91
and journalism, but went
straight to something else,


101
0:5:46,91 --> 0:5:48,52
which is an emotional truth.


102
0:5:48,52 --> 0:5:52,35



103
0:5:52,35 --> 0:5:54,85
I don't know if I made a
conscious decision to stop


104
0:5:54,85 --> 0:5:56,58
doing wars or not.


105
0:5:56,58 --> 0:5:58,84
Part of it's I had a child.


106
0:5:58,84 --> 0:6:1,86
One skill set that I had in
doing that kind of work was


107
0:6:1,86 --> 0:6:5,14
that I was able to remain
relatively calm in those


108
0:6:5,14 --> 0:6:5,87
situations.


109
0:6:5,87 --> 0:6:9,82
And now, I felt like I didn't
trust how I would react.


110
0:6:9,82 --> 0:6:13,27
But there's also the other side
of me, which is that, for


111
0:6:13,27 --> 0:6:17,85
me, there was never this oh, I
used to be that and now I've


112
0:6:17,85 --> 0:6:18,6
become this.


113
0:6:18,6 --> 0:6:22,22
It's just we grow and we
change as human beings.


114
0:6:22,22 --> 0:6:25,45
So even from a creative
standpoint, I'm taken in


115
0:6:25,45 --> 0:6:26,86
different directions now--


116
0:6:26,86 --> 0:6:28,86
portraits, for instance.


117
0:6:28,86 --> 0:6:33,8
And really looking at why
I like some portraits--


118
0:6:33,8 --> 0:6:36,3
why some portraiture is
compelling and others are not.


119
0:6:36,3 --> 0:6:40,79
And me, not coming from any
formal, technical training of


120
0:6:40,79 --> 0:6:46,11
photography, forcing myself to
learn some of those things in


121
0:6:46,11 --> 0:6:51,26
order to pull off what it is
that I want to photograph.


122
0:6:51,26 --> 0:6:52,806
Yeah, I kind of like
those challenges.


123
0:6:52,806 --> 0:6:55,925



124
0:6:55,925 --> 0:6:56,871
[INAUDIBLE].


125
0:6:56,871 --> 0:6:58,763
[PRETEND MONSTER GROWL]


126
0:6:58,763 --> 0:7:1,36
[LAUGHING]


127
0:7:1,36 --> 0:7:2,772
What did you have?


128
0:7:2,772 --> 0:7:3,684
What did I have?


129
0:7:3,684 --> 0:7:4,14
Mmhm.


130
0:7:4,14 --> 0:7:5,52
What do you mean,
what did I have?


131
0:7:5,52 --> 0:7:6,32
No, a present.


132
0:7:6,32 --> 0:7:7,52
A present?


133
0:7:7,52 --> 0:7:7,987
Mmhm.


134
0:7:7,987 --> 0:7:8,921
If I have a present?


135
0:7:8,921 --> 0:7:10,79
Mmhm.


136
0:7:10,79 --> 0:7:12,37
The son project--


137
0:7:12,37 --> 0:7:15,25
the photographs of my
son and my father--


138
0:7:15,25 --> 0:7:18,7
really happened quite
organically in the sense that


139
0:7:18,7 --> 0:7:19,44
I had a kid.


140
0:7:19,44 --> 0:7:24,2
It started like any father
taking pictures of their kid.


141
0:7:24,2 --> 0:7:28,22
At about the same time,
my father became ill.


142
0:7:28,22 --> 0:7:35,38
And so I was thinking about
very obvious themes of the


143
0:7:35,38 --> 0:7:37,2
cycles of life and death.


144
0:7:37,2 --> 0:7:41,63
And that's the weird thing
about parenthood--


145
0:7:41,63 --> 0:7:44,1
is completely universal
and mundane.


146
0:7:44,1 --> 0:7:48,85
And at the same time, it's
completely unique and intimate


147
0:7:48,85 --> 0:7:50,27
and special.


148
0:7:50,27 --> 0:7:54,55
And so I began photographing my
father and my son, and at


149
0:7:54,55 --> 0:7:58,76
the beginning, just without
thinking about it.


150
0:7:58,76 --> 0:8:2,39
And it started to dawn on me
that what I was seeing in the


151
0:8:2,39 --> 0:8:9,69
pictures was that quality that
I felt like I'd been on a


152
0:8:9,69 --> 0:8:14,94
search for since I first
started using a camera.


153
0:8:14,94 --> 0:8:18,74
And that everything that I had
photographed up until that


154
0:8:18,74 --> 0:8:24,3
point was as if it were just
some sort of preparation to


155
0:8:24,3 --> 0:8:30,0
bring me to that point, to
provide me with the tools or


156
0:8:30,0 --> 0:8:32,89
the insight or whatever
it was in order


157
0:8:32,89 --> 0:8:34,799
to make those pictures.


158
0:8:34,799 --> 0:8:38,0
And that that was
my life's work.


159
0:8:38,0 --> 0:8:41,83
It was very quick, also, because
that particular set of


160
0:8:41,83 --> 0:8:47,37
pictures loses its magic the
moment that it becomes a


161
0:8:47,37 --> 0:8:50,1
conscious work.


162
0:8:50,1 --> 0:8:56,41
Flash card, camera, lenses,
extra battery.


163
0:8:56,41 --> 0:9:5,45



164
0:9:5,45 --> 0:9:8,52
See, I always want to take
a picture right here.


165
0:9:8,52 --> 0:9:9,48
And I can't.


166
0:9:9,48 --> 0:9:10,92
I'd have to park my car.


167
0:9:10,92 --> 0:9:16,21



168
0:9:16,21 --> 0:9:19,68
The work I'm doing now with "New
York Magazine," it's a


169
0:9:19,68 --> 0:9:23,5
big change for me, because I'm
staying mostly at home to do


170
0:9:23,5 --> 0:9:28,47
it after years of having worked
mostly in strange


171
0:9:28,47 --> 0:9:31,61
places around the world.


172
0:9:31,61 --> 0:9:37,606
Check this out, this old Bronx
courthouse that's just bricked


173
0:9:37,606 --> 0:9:38,856
up and empty.


174
0:9:38,856 --> 0:9:41,56



175
0:9:41,56 --> 0:9:44,62
And also, for me, it is
an extension of what


176
0:9:44,62 --> 0:9:46,35
the son work was.


177
0:9:46,35 --> 0:9:51,63
The son photographs are this
first time where I look at my


178
0:9:51,63 --> 0:9:56,12
own world, at this city in which
I live, and the people


179
0:9:56,12 --> 0:9:57,83
that I live with in this city.


180
0:9:57,83 --> 0:10:4,1
And so in that sense, the work
retains this personal edge to


181
0:10:4,1 --> 0:10:6,13
it, this personal connection--


182
0:10:6,13 --> 0:10:9,64
my world of New York and my
friendships with other


183
0:10:9,64 --> 0:10:12,4
photographers and artists
and writers.


184
0:10:12,4 --> 0:10:15,18
And it's part of this collective
experience that


185
0:10:15,18 --> 0:10:19,21
we're having now that I'm
privileged enough to get to


186
0:10:19,21 --> 0:10:20,73
photograph in a concentrated
way.


187
0:10:20,73 --> 0:10:34,93



188
0:10:34,93 --> 0:10:39,828
Yeah, I don't know Spanish
Harlem as well as


189
0:10:39,828 --> 0:10:40,94
I would like to.


190
0:10:40,94 --> 0:10:44,585
I would like to really
explore it more.


191
0:10:44,585 --> 0:10:46,255
Wow, there is a--


192
0:10:46,255 --> 0:10:48,84
I'm going to try to stop here,
because there's a great shot.


193
0:10:48,84 --> 0:10:50,66
And these aren't really the
projects that we're looking


194
0:10:50,66 --> 0:10:52,89
at, but I see a great
shot here.


195
0:10:52,89 --> 0:10:56,152



196
0:10:56,152 --> 0:11:0,77
I go out, and I think of it as I
start turning over rocks and


197
0:11:0,77 --> 0:11:2,99
see what I find underneath.


198
0:11:2,99 --> 0:11:4,89
And sometimes, you find
the most interesting


199
0:11:4,89 --> 0:11:6,14
things under a rock.


200
0:11:6,14 --> 0:11:8,52



201
0:11:8,52 --> 0:11:10,7
And sometimes, you
find nothing.


202
0:11:10,7 --> 0:11:17,43



203
0:11:17,43 --> 0:11:22,36
But a lot of it is just about
going out and meeting people


204
0:11:22,36 --> 0:11:25,22
and seeing where
that leads to.


205
0:11:25,22 --> 0:11:25,57
Hello.


206
0:11:25,57 --> 0:11:26,17
Hi.


207
0:11:26,17 --> 0:11:27,358
Are you Ms. [INAUDIBLE]?


208
0:11:27,358 --> 0:11:27,805
No.


209
0:11:27,805 --> 0:11:28,252
No?


210
0:11:28,252 --> 0:11:28,7
Is she--


211
0:11:28,7 --> 0:11:29,25
She's not here.


212
0:11:29,25 --> 0:11:29,752
She's not here.


213
0:11:29,752 --> 0:11:30,958
Oh.


214
0:11:30,958 --> 0:11:32,73
I heard she takes care
of the gardens.


215
0:11:32,73 --> 0:11:33,63
Is that right?


216
0:11:33,63 --> 0:11:34,395
Yeah.


217
0:11:34,395 --> 0:11:36,14
What's that?


218
0:11:36,14 --> 0:11:36,96
She went to the store.


219
0:11:36,96 --> 0:11:38,35
They said she'd be back
in a little bit.


220
0:11:38,35 --> 0:11:39,298
There she is right there.


221
0:11:39,298 --> 0:11:40,72
But that's my garden
right there.


222
0:11:40,72 --> 0:11:42,145
Oh, you have a garden
here, too?


223
0:11:42,145 --> 0:11:42,47
Yeah.


224
0:11:42,47 --> 0:11:43,87
Oh, great.


225
0:11:43,87 --> 0:11:46,15
We met a couple of women
who have tended


226
0:11:46,15 --> 0:11:49,36
gardens outside of projects.


227
0:11:49,36 --> 0:11:52,875
They were a connection
into this world.


228
0:11:52,875 --> 0:11:55,39



229
0:11:55,39 --> 0:11:57,25
You never know what
that leads to.


230
0:11:57,25 --> 0:12:2,46
You never know when you get
invited in for tea or


231
0:12:2,46 --> 0:12:7,3
whatever, and all of sudden,
this other world opens up to


232
0:12:7,3 --> 0:12:12,36
you that you would have never
known just by walking by or


233
0:12:12,36 --> 0:12:13,61
just by showing up.


234
0:12:13,61 --> 0:12:20,616



235
0:12:20,616 --> 0:12:23,111
There's no winners and there's
no losers out here.


236
0:12:23,111 --> 0:12:25,12
Everybody wins.


237
0:12:25,12 --> 0:12:26,87
I want ya'll to understand
that.


238
0:12:26,87 --> 0:12:27,66
Nobody loses.


239
0:12:27,66 --> 0:12:29,63
Everybody wins in
this tournament.


240
0:12:29,63 --> 0:12:35,25
If there's one word that I hope
describes my pictures--


241
0:12:35,25 --> 0:12:37,86
the gist of my pictures--
it's intimacy.


242
0:12:37,86 --> 0:12:42,66
And that requires an interaction
with people, to


243
0:12:42,66 --> 0:12:43,6
some extent.


244
0:12:43,6 --> 0:12:48,29
I want the pictures to feel
more than just this shadow


245
0:12:48,29 --> 0:12:54,13
that passes by and
stops a scene.


246
0:12:54,13 --> 0:12:57,525
I want it to feel engaged
and connected.


247
0:12:57,525 --> 0:13:3,41



248
0:13:3,41 --> 0:13:6,69
New York is one of the strange
places to photograph, because


249
0:13:6,69 --> 0:13:9,11
first of all, it's terribly
photogenic.


250
0:13:9,11 --> 0:13:11,51
There are pictures-- there
are cliches everywhere.


251
0:13:11,51 --> 0:13:13,85
But there's this light
bouncing around.


252
0:13:13,85 --> 0:13:17,726
There's this, graphically,
these big buildings and


253
0:13:17,726 --> 0:13:20,13
canyons of the streets
and these characters


254
0:13:20,13 --> 0:13:21,36
all over the place.


255
0:13:21,36 --> 0:13:23,81
And also, it's overwhelming.


256
0:13:23,81 --> 0:13:25,0
It's daunting--


257
0:13:25,0 --> 0:13:27,97
this idea of photographing New
York, because it is a genre in


258
0:13:27,97 --> 0:13:29,22
and of itself.


259
0:13:29,22 --> 0:13:30,49
It's a photographic cliche.


260
0:13:30,49 --> 0:13:37,79



261
0:13:37,79 --> 0:13:40,18
You feel overwhelmed
by this idea.


262
0:13:40,18 --> 0:13:45,27
How can I ever attempt
to do that?


263
0:13:45,27 --> 0:13:47,1
It's all been done before.


264
0:13:47,1 --> 0:13:52,62
At the same time, it hasn't
been done, I feel, from my


265
0:13:52,62 --> 0:13:56,267
point of view right now in this
year, this week, today.


266
0:13:56,267 --> 0:14:0,1



267
0:14:0,1 --> 0:14:5,12
As I'm working, I'm thinking of
these images that I make on


268
0:14:5,12 --> 0:14:9,0
the street today, what that
picture will mean


269
0:14:9,0 --> 0:14:10,38
10 years from now.


270
0:14:10,38 --> 0:14:15,52
I think sometimes pictures age
well in the sense that today,


271
0:14:15,52 --> 0:14:17,94
it's a picture that doesn't
look like much or it


272
0:14:17,94 --> 0:14:18,79
doesn't mean much.


273
0:14:18,79 --> 0:14:22,15
But can you imagine this thing
10 years from now, 20 years


274
0:14:22,15 --> 0:14:24,2
from now, 50 years from now?


275
0:14:24,2 --> 0:14:26,94
That's how photography,
to me, is interesting.


276
0:14:26,94 --> 0:14:28,23
It's not just that moment.


277
0:14:28,23 --> 0:14:29,96
It's not just today.


278
0:14:29,96 --> 0:14:33,25
It's something that's
a longer thing.


279
0:14:33,25 --> 0:14:35,87
So yeah, I'm aware of the
assignment today, and I go out


280
0:14:35,87 --> 0:14:39,27
and I do that, do my work,
and do it correctly.


281
0:14:39,27 --> 0:14:41,78
But really, as I'm doing an
assignment, it's about the


282
0:14:41,78 --> 0:14:45,16
longer view, the bigger picture,
and how this thing


283
0:14:45,16 --> 0:14:48,47
becomes a piece of a
much larger puzzle.


284
0:14:48,47 --> 0:16:48,47
