###5 Africa is a battle field for wildlife
###9 a place where ancient giants‥
###13 stealthy hunters‥
###16 and unparalleled predators
###18 engage in a never-ending struggle for survival
###26 But among these species 12 rule supreme
###32 These predators are swift‥
###35 powerful‥
###38 and often lethal
###42 Prepare to come face to face with Africa's Deadly Dozen
###60 In many people's minds
###62 this is the last truly wild continent
###68 Its 30 million square kilometres
###70 contain some of the world's most extreme landscapes‥
###77 ‥the Serengeti
###78 a vast arena for the delicate ballet of life and death‥
###84 ‥the Okavango
###86 an oasis emerging from the parched Kalahari Desert‥
###91 ‥and the Great Rift Valley
###93 an unforgiving terrain and the scorching 'cradle of man'
###100 These brutal cauldrons forge creatures of incomparable strength and power‥
###105 creatures found nowhere else on Earth
###114 Most of Africa's wildlife and its people
###117 live south of the searing Sahara Desert
###121 And in this region one predator in particular reigns
###124 the snake
###135 Africa plays host to the greatest diversity of snakes in the world
###139 400 in total
###141 with over 90 of them venomous
###144 And these toxic serpents are built for the kill
###157 Each is uniquely specialized to capture its prey
###166 Sleek cobras stalk‥
###168 while muscular vipers lie in wait‥
###171 and still others take to the trees
###174 But if threatened
###175 all of these predators will lash out with a hiss of death
###187 And among them
###188 this is the quintessential deadly serpent‥
###191 embodying all that's lethal without even baring it fangs
###196 It's known as Naja Nivea the cape cobra
###200 and anyone who corners this snake
###202 is likely to pay with their life
###212 The one and a half metre cobra
###214 is neither the biggest nor the widest-ranging venomous serpent in Africa
###221 It's only found in one region the southwest
###224 but this includes the heavily-populated country of South Africa
###229 And it often appears in prime ranching territory
###232 so human encounters are all too common
###242 Every year, the cape cobra kills more people in South Africa
###245 than any other snake
###247 Its speckled skin enables it to almost disappear within the landscape
###253 until it's stumbled upon by an unlucky rancher or shepherd
###261 When trapped it raises the front of its body high
###264 and spreads its trademark hood in a display of intimidation‥
###271 then it strikes
###276 The rush of venom immediately attacks the body's nervous system
###280 It paralyzes the muscles
###281 and triggers coronary and respiratory failure
###284 Just one bite can kill up to six people
###296 And the cobra doesn't just strike once
###303 It continues to strike until the threat has moved away
###307 flooding its victim with toxins
###310 Another venomous snake also lurks among the branches
###314 and this one is practically invisible
###320 It's the eastern green mamba Africa's emerald giant
###328 Resting in the canopy it's easily missed
###332 But when it's on the move
###334 it's clear what makes this serpent so deadly
###340 The green mamba stretches up to two metres long
###348 Its slender contours and camouflage
###350 mean it's perfectly suited to a life in the trees
###353 where it sleeps‥
###354 mates‥ and feeds
###364 The green mamba hunts a sinuous band
###366 from coastal Kenya south to Zimbabwe
###369 where it lurks in scrub bush and forests
###374 It's nearly invisible to the birds rodents and small lizards it pursues
###385 Its ever-vigilant eyes never close
###388 because fixed transparent shields serve in place of eyelids
###397 Its attention is drawn by movement
###402 One misplaced hand and the mamba springs to life
###424 Victims of its bite feel a burning pain
###427 As the venom spreads it eats away tissue
###430 potentially causing gangrene
###431 and leaving behind a permanent scar
###438 Fortunately green mambas often choose escape over confrontation
###442 and only a handful of deaths have ever been recorded
###450 But another mamba also lives up here
###452 less shy than its green cousin‥
###456 and this one is lethal
###464 It's the black mamba
###474 The black mamba follows a trail of aerial clues‥
###477 tasting the air as it goes
###490 Its target is an abandoned hatchling
###504 Potent venom floods the tiny bird's system
###506 killing it swiftly
###515 This mamba is a far more dangerous snake than the green
###520 Not only is it found across a much larger swath of the continent
###523 from Ethiopia to Namibia
###525 but it also hunts on the ground
###531 And that places it in direct contact with humans
###543 It only takes one encounter with a black mamba
###545 to realize what makes this snake so terrifying
###550 Not only is it extraordinarily toxic
###552 it's the longest and fastest snake in Africa
###562 A black mamba can reach burst speeds of five metres per second
###566 faster than most people can run
###577 Incredibly, the mamba can also lift half of its 3.5m body off the ground
###583 and return to the trees
###597 Every harvest season
###599 orchard workers venture into the realm of the black mamba
###604 Surrounded, the snake will first try to escape
###607 But if it has nowhere to go‥ it will defend itself
###618 Flashing its ebony-coloured mouth it strikes
###624 The victim is infused with a complex torrent of paralyzing toxins
###628 This venom attacks the body's muscles and heart and lung function
###631 And when the muscles stop asphyxiation sets in
###639 Death can occur in as few as 20 minutes
###656 Before anti-venom
###658 the black mamba's bite was almost 100 per cent fatal
###663 But today hospitals can save most victims
###666 if they can get there in time
###672 But while the black mamba may be Africa's most feared snake
###675 it's not the deadliest
###680 That distinction goes to the master of concealment‥
###684 the puff adder
###690 It kills more people in Africa than any other snake
###698 It earns this dubious distinction because of its huge range
###701 which covers nearly half the continent
###703 from tropical Senegal to Eritrea and South Africa
###711 Most encounters are accidental
###713 because victims often don't see the well-hidden adder
###725 Slow and muscular it can't use speed to escape
###739 So instead, it relies on its method of attack
###742 This heavy snake launches its one metre body into the air
###746 and towards any unwise intruder
###756 Centimetre long hollow fangs inject a venom
###759 that starts to destroy blood cells and tissue almost immediately
###766 Most people do survive the encounter
###769 But the adder's range
###770 and the sheer number of bites it inflicts
###773 reap a deadly toll that results in more fatalities
###776 than any other African snake
###781 But people aren't the only casualties
###792 Undetected, this adder remains frozen
###796 Although its victim is only centimetres away
###798 it has no idea of its impending death
###806 The adder attacks when the target
###808 is unable to use teeth and claws in self defence
###831 Its lower jaw widens to accommodate larger prey
###842 When the meal is finally devoured
###844 its jaw flexes back to normal
###850 Africa's snakes inhabit almost every corner of the continent
###854 brilliantly adapted for life both on the ground
###857 and high above
###873 In the Savannas of eastern and southern Africa
###876 water is the most precious commodity
###883 And within these pools
###885 live two of Africa's most lethal animals
###888 both armed to the teeth
###928 Every year, Nile crocodiles kill hundreds of people
###932 probably more than all other species of crocodile combined
###945 They hunt waterways throughout most of Africa
###952 Yet people have driven them
###953 from much of the river that shares their name
###962 A reptile of epic proportions
###965 the Nile crocodile can grow to lengths of six metres
###967 and weigh close to a ton
###974 Its power allows it to select from a vast menu of prey
###977 including buffalo
###980 antelope
###982 and even young elephants
###987 A fully grown Nile crocodile has few natural enemies
###1009 Equipped with eyes on the top of its head
###1012 it studies its prey‥
###1013 and hides
###1021 A Nile croc lying in wait
###1023 can hold its breath for over 45 minutes
###1030 But with a simple flick of its tail
###1032 it catapults itself out of the water
###1048 It grabs its prey by the head or limb
###1050 and pulls the meal down to a murky death
###1068 Another water-borne creature also lashes out with its teeth
###1072 but this one is a herbivore‥
###1074 the hippo
###1081 Its placid demeanor belies a volatile temperament
###1095 During the day
###1096 a water hole can offer cool refuge from the searing African heat
###1107 Here, a hippo is in its element
###1109 Despite its substantial mass the creature is buoyant
###1117 When a three and a half ton hippo slips below the surface
###1120 it seals its nostrils completely
###1122 and can hold its breath for up to 30 minutes
###1133 Hippos inhabit the watering holes of west, east and southern Africa
###1137 as well as the upper reaches of the Nile River
###1149 Only one predator will hunt an adult hippo‥
###1154 a pride of lions
###1161 And even then, they're not easily taken
###1171 Hippos can run at nearly 30 kilometres per hour
###1181 The males wield 30 centimetre tusks which they use in battle
###1185 These giant canines can deliver devastating wounds‥
###1189 and are capable of biting a crocodile in half
###1204 But it's the females that pose the greatest threat to humans
###1207 They protect their calves fiercely
###1210 even from other hippos
###1225 With a newborn to guard
###1227 an adult female won't tolerate any intruder
###1241 Every year, these leviathans kill dozens of people
###1252 Although their range is shrinking
###1254 hippos still rule the water hole
###1261 Africa's aquatic giants are well adapted for survival
###1266 Whether on dry land‥
###1269 in the water‥
###1271 or under it‥
###1273 these animals are equipped to deal with all threats
###1276 and opportunities
###1278 head on
###1289 Africa is home to some of the most awe-inspiring wildlife on the planet
###1293 venomous insects‥
###1295 toxic serpents‥
###1298 and deadly predators
###1304 But few species embody all that is Africa
###1307 like its ancient giants
###1318 This grazer weighs nearly a ton
###1321 While it feeds, it's calm
###1328 But suddenly
###1329 it can transform into one of the most dangerous creatures on the continent
###1333 The hunter becomes the hunted as the behemoth retaliates
###1349 The cape buffalo spends 18 hours a day
###1351 moving across the Savanna in relative peace
###1356 But when provoked
###1358 the grass-fed giant can prove a worthy adversary
###1360 of both fierce carnivores like lions‥
###1364 and trophy hunting humans
###1367 who target the buffalo for its ornate rack of horns
###1381 It thunders along at the speed of a galloping horse
###1388 It can easily disembowel a predator
###1391 with little more than a slash of its horns
###1393 or a well-aimed hoof
###1413 100 years ago
###1415 buffalo roamed nearly all of sub-Saharan Africa
###1418 But today, they're gone from most of the south
###1426 Yet they're still among the most abundant large animals on the continent
###1430 and the only thing more dangerous than one buffalo
###1433 is a startled herd, stampeding
###1448 Another massive creature shares the buffalo's territory‥
###1451 but this one squeezes the life from its victims
###1458 It lies in wait watching for its prey to approach
###1461 and prepares to attack
###1473 The African rock python has a deadly embrace
###1477 Unlike other snakes
###1479 this constrictor doesn't strike with venom
###1482 Instead, it kills with muscle
###1490 African rock pythons can weigh up to 135 kilograms
###1494 and grow to over six metres‥
###1497 making them among the largest snakes in the world
###1504 They live throughout the Savannas and forests of sub-Saharan Africa
###1510 Already powerful on land
###1512 this brawny serpent employs an even more impressive tactic from underwater
###1517 where it glides with fluid grace
###1519 Ever adaptable
###1521 the pythons that live near water thrive on fish
###1529 And older snakes can find even bigger prey here
###1532 They wait underwater‥
###1535 rising every 30 minutes to take a discreet breath
###1549 They can spend hours in this coil of tension‥
###1552 waiting for just the right moment to strike
###1569 Scores of teeth seize the prey‥
###1572 and muscular coils envelop the victim
###1585 Crushed, the springbok is slowly asphyxiated
###1594 The python can swallow up to 60kg of lifeless prey - whole
###1606 After a meal like this
###1608 it can fast for more than a year
###1612 But even so
###1613 it should always be approached with caution
###1624 This snake will defend itself
###1626 no matter what the size of the threat
###1629 So, although pythons rarely eat people
###1631 they can still kill us
###1638 Giants that are placid in appearance‥
###1640 can sometimes transform into killers when provoked
###1645 But one of Africa's enormous animals
###1648 is unexpectedly deadly
###1658 It weighs more than a truck‥
###1662 stands twice as tall as a human‥
###1665 and can crush with a misplaced foot
###1673 It's the world's largest land animal
###1680 And if you enrage an elephant its fury can be lethal
###1699 Humans have pushed elephants to the brink
###1702 dividing their lands‥
###1706 culling their ranks‥
###1709 and causing disarray in their families
###1714 And now, elephants are pushing back
###1722 Once, they roamed much of Africa freely
###1726 But today
###1727 most elephants are confined to patches of protected land
###1730 in central, east and southern Africa
###1744 Roads and farms divide them from their traditional grounds
###1747 and impede their timeless migrations
###1760 As a result of this
###1761 they're often forced into unnatural habitats
###1764 where they quickly exhaust food supplies
###1766 and have to compete with domestic herds for water
###1777 While seeking out new territories
###1779 they can ravage fields and gardens
###1793 And all too often this leads to confrontations
###1796 with unarmed rural inhabitants
###1803 In the 1990s
###1805 more than 200 people were killed by elephants in Kenya alone
###1826 Efforts are underway to reduce elephant overcrowding
###1830 But with ever-decreasing territory
###1831 their conflicts with us will only increase
###1838 Of Africa's trio of ancient giants
###1840 two are grazers‥
###1843 and only one is a predator
###1849 But all have earned a place
###1851 among this land's most lethal animals
###1859 A pair of predators rules the African darkness
###1862 One is a cunning hunter‥
###1865 and the other, the ultimate survivor
###1874 But neither is exactly what it appears to be
###1886 As they stalk in the darkness
###1888 their invisible laughter pierces the shadows
###1891 and stirs panic in all who hear it
###1903 These creatures are legendary hunters and scavengers
###1915 These are the eery calls of the spotted hyena
###1925 There are three species of hyena in Africa
###1928 the striped and the brown which are solitary‥
###1932 and the spotted which is a highly social animal
###1939 The spotted hyena ranges from Senegal and Somalia in the north
###1943 to Botswana and Namibia in the south
###1946 making it the most common large carnivore in Africa
###1951 Clans contain up to 80 individuals
###1959 But they break into smaller teams to hunt
###1990 Once dismissed as maniacal 'laughter'
###1993 their yelps, growls and whoops act as a dinner bell‥
###1997 a call to arms‥
###1999 or a warning to their cubs
###2003 Their body language also sends signals to the clan‥
###2008 intent to attack‥
###2010 excitement‥
###2012 or fear
###2020 When clan territory overlaps with that of other predators
###2023 hyenas will intimidate any carnivorous competitors
###2027 and, if given the chance kill their cubs
###2037 They eat anything
###2038 At a kill, nothing is left to waste
###2046 The hyena's massively-muscled head and neck
###2048 power some of the strongest jaws in nature
###2051 They can exert a bite force stronger than that of a lion
###2060 Hyenas are efficient hunters
###2062 with the ability to crush, swallow
###2065 and digest nearly every part of their prey
###2068 including the bones
###2075 They kill their prey with their brutal jaws
###2078 But another of the night's hunters
###2080 wields a much smaller
###2082 but equally effective - weapon
###2116 The toxic punch unleashed by this predator
###2119 has earned it the name 'death stalker'
###2129 This scorpion is only 10cm long
###2132 but it's possibly the most dangerous in the world
###2140 400 million years ago
###2142 long before the age of the dinosaurs
###2145 scorpions were perfecting the tactics, armour and venom
###2148 that would ensure their success
###2155 There are more than 1,200 different species on the planet
###2158 and hundreds of them live only in Africa
###2167 But the death stalker thrives in one of the most extreme environments on Earth
###2173 The Sahara Desert is the centre of its territory
###2176 which stretches from Egypt southwest to Mali
###2185 Scorpions hunt the shadows seeking out spiders
###2188 small rodents and insects
###2197 Their pincers snatch their prey and prepare it for the kill
###2206 Then the stinger injects the lethal blow
###2215 Although a sting delivers less venom than a snake bite
###2218 the death stalker's toxins
###2220 are nearly three times as powerful as a cape cobra's
###2233 Fever, convulsions and increased blood pressure
###2236 can wrack victims in as few as five minutes
###2249 But fewer than 3 per cent of stings are lethal
###2253 Children suffer the most fatalities
###2255 because a dose of venom is far more potent in their smaller bodies
###2267 A pack hunter‥ and a solitary killer
###2270 Africa's nocturnal predators have a tactic for every occasion
###2285 But among Africa's deadly dozen
###2287 one animal reigns supreme
###2295 With up to 250 kilograms of pure muscle
###2299 it's the largest carnivore on the continent
###2312 They hunt in daylight and at night
###2315 alone‥ or in teams
###2321 There's no creature too big or too smart
###2325 for them to tackle‥
###2327 even us
###2331 When they catch an animal
###2333 they just eat everything
###2336 After falling down
###2338 they started to bite me on the legs
###2345 The lion is perhaps the most formidable predator in all of Africa
###2358 Once, lions roamed nearly all of this land
###2361 unsurpassed and unstoppable
###2367 But then they met us
###2377 Over the course of the last century
###2379 humans have killed hundreds of thousands of them
###2386 Today, the big cats may number fewer than 23,000
###2392 Small numbers remain in west African countries like Mali
###2395 while other populations range from Somalia and south to Namibia
###2402 But most of them live behind the long fences of reserves
###2405 like South Africa's Kruger National Park
###2408 sanctuary for more than 2,700 lions
###2423 In November 1998
###2425 park guard Sydney Maziya
###2427 was shutting down the neighbouring Marloth Game Reserve for the evening
###2434 He received word that a gate at the far end of the park was open
###2438 and was given an order to close it
###2446 The only way for Maziya to cross the reserve was by bicycle
###2450 even though there were lions around
###2453 While I was still cycling to the gate
###2457 I heard the sound of the lions
###2470 Lions have nine different vocalizations
###2472 but it's their roar that indicates their domain
###2481 And the roars surrounding Sydney were coming from all directions
###2491 Females - often sisters form the core of a pride of lions
###2497 They're joined by males who can be nearly twice their size
###2505 Together, they're armed with enough power
###2507 to take down a buffalo weighing nearly a ton
###2514 Their muscular back legs launch them towards their quarry‥
###2517 while their agile front legs pull the prey to the ground
###2538 The fatal bite is often delivered by a male
###2541 and he's the first to feed
###2548 But while their size helps them to hunt
###2550 it comes at a price
###2563 Every hunt is crucial because it requires precious energy
###2567 Ultimately, only about one in every five attempts succeeds
###2578 And in rare instances, some lions turn to a weaker form of prey
###2594 In 1898
###2596 lions terrorized the track layers of an East African Railroad Company
###2605 Two notorious animals killed and ate more than 120 people
###2610 They became known as the Man-Eaters of Tsavo
###2617 After nine months of terror
###2619 the project's chief engineer Lieutenant Colonel John Henry Patterson
###2623 finally shot the elusive cats
###2629 Today, lions kill dozens of people every year
###2632 a statistic with which park guard Sydney Maziya was all too familiar
###2642 When the lion jumped over me
###2644 what came in my mind was that 'oh now, I am dead.'
###2658 Before long, more lions had joined in the attack on Maziya
###2668 The other lions that came to me and started to eat me
###2700 Then suddenly, his luck changed
###2703 A truck appeared and the driver had a gun
###2724 They bite me on my thigh on my knee
###2728 After the lion left, I realized how badly injured I was
###2736 I was losing a lot of blood
###2743 Sydney Maziya's mauled legs are now mended
###2745 and he's back on his feet
###2747 But his encounter has left him with a healthy respect
###2751 for the most formidable predator in Africa
###2756 It is lucky if they don't kill you
###2759 Because I know, usually if they grab you, they kill you
###2782 They're an elite group of 12‥
###2784 embodying all of nature's grandeur and power
###2790 They have thrived with a vast array of survival skills and defences
###2797 They are Africa's Deadly Dozen
