###15 EDDY MORETTI: Al Gore has spoken out against the
###16 development of the oil sands.
###18 As far as he's concerned, it's like a junkie tapping a vein
###22 in their toe.
###24 He thinks we're addicted to oil, and the tar sands are
###27 merely perpetuating that addiction.
###28 Ralph Klein doesn't, really, agree.
###32 You have a reputation of being a straight
###34 talking kind of guy.
###37 You and Al Gore have been, you know, butting heads--
###42 RALPH KLEIN: No, no, no.
###42 We aren't butting heads.
###43 First of all, I'm out of politics,
###45 and he's out of politics.
###46 And hopefully, he'll stay out of politics--
###48 EDDY MORETTI: But he, you know, if you--
###49 RALPH KLEIN: --and I will, too.
###51 EDDY MORETTI: What did Gore actually say that got your
###54 back up so much?
###55 RALPH KLEIN: The--
###56 EDDY MORETTI: He equated the industry to a drug pusher that
###60 was satisfying America's fix.
###64 RALPH KLEIN: No, it's not that at all.
###66 You know, well first of all, he's of a different political
###71 bent than me.
###72 EDDY MORETTI: In what way?
###73 You're more right--
###74 RALPH KLEIN: Well, I'm a
###75 conservative, and he is a socialist.
###78 EDDY MORETTI: You don't think his motive is to save the
###80 planet, or--
###81 RALPH KLEIN: No no, I don't think his motive is that.
###82 His motive is-- he's a politician.
###85 You know, the first question you should ask him-- are you
###88 an environmentalist or a politician.
###91 EDDY MORETTI: And you think he'd answer--
###93 RALPH KLEIN: Well, he'll say, "I am both."
###96 Well which one would--
###98 are you most of?
###99 Are you mostly a politician, or are you mostly an
###102 environmentalist?
###103 EDDY MORETTI: You don't think you could be both, today, in
###106 this world?
###107 RALPH KLEIN: Look it, I have on my home, "an
###109 environmentalist lives here." I was both.
###112 I was Minister of the Environment.
###114 First of all, ask him what kind of a car he drives.
###117 Secondly, ask him if he recycles.
###119 EDDY MORETTI: Two things should be said.
###121 One is that Al Gore seems to be an expert on global warming
###124 and climate change.
###125 RALPH KLEIN: Well, no no.
###126 He is a policy wonk.
###128 He Is a policy wonk.
###130 He knows no more about global warming--
###134 as a matter of fact, if he wants to know about global
###136 warming, then perhaps the best thing to do is to destroy the
###142 population of the world.
###144 Right?
###144 And then we would all stop exhaling.
###148 Right--
###148 EDDY MORETTI: That--
###149 RALPH KLEIN: And CO2 is one of the major greenhouse gases.
###152 EDDY MORETTI: So you don't you believe in
###154 global warming as a--
###156 RALPH KLEIN: Here's what the Province of Alberta believes.
###161 Accept the science, but also accept that there is an
###167 economy to sustain.
###169 And accept the fact that we are a carbon-based economy.
###173 EDDY MORETTI: Are you tired of being judged by these people?
###176 Do you think they're moralists?
###178 RALPH KLEIN: I think they're moralists.
###179 I think that they have a political agenda,
###182 which is not my agenda.
###183 EDDY MORETTI: Right.
###184 RALPH KLEIN: Be conscious of the environment.
###187 Be conscious of clean water.
###191 EDDY MORETTI: The water in Fort McMurray is interesting,
###194 because the industry sucks so much water--
###198 RALPH KLEIN: Oh, no.
###198 It's not good.
###199 You know, and the tailings ponds have always been--
###201 EDDY MORETTI: It looks bad, and it probably smells bad.
###204 And you wouldn't want to drink that water.
###205 RALPH KLEIN: No, you wouldn't want to drink that water.
###207 Nobody would.
###208 EDDY MORETTI: But you're not super
###209 concerned about those ponds.
###211 RALPH KLEIN: No, I'm not too concerned, because the
###214 scientists and the PhDs and, you know, the petroleum
###217 engineers and so on, are working on solutions.
###221 EDDY MORETTI: You have a lot of faith in science.
###222 RALPH KLEIN: --to clean up the environment.
###223 Yeah, I do have a lot of faith in science.
###225 And I have a lot of faith in the very educated people who
###230 are involved in the industry, right now.
###232 
###236 EDDY MORETTI: So what do they call this place?
###239 MALE SPEAKER: Borealis.
###240 EDDY MORETTI: Borealis.
###241 It kind of looks like a mall meets a high school.
###245 MALE SPEAKER: [LAUGHTER]
###246 Yeah.
###246 EDDY MORETTI: Are there stores inside?
###248 We're going in for class.
###250 
###254 Well it's just a hub of activity, here.
###258 It's pretty clean.
###260 It's not what I was expecting, but also, they were saying
###263 this is one of the nicer ones.
###264 And you know, I guess there isn't even enough of this
###268 housing, right now, so you're lucky if you can get into one.
###271 Let's see what they're reading--
###273 Baghdad Without A Map, of course, From The
###277 Snows To The Sands.
###279 Are you from out west, too.
###280 MIKE: NO.
###280 I'm, actually, East Coast, [INAUDIBLE].
###282 EDDY MORETTI: Hi, Eddy, nice to meet you.
###284 MIKE: Eddy, nice to meet you--Mike.
###285 EDDY MORETTI: And how do you like being up here?
###287 MIKE: Oh, it's good money.
###287 It's great [INAUDIBLE].
###288 EDDY MORETTI: And how's the pay?
###291 MIKE: Pay is good, work's good.
###292 EDDY MORETTI: Yeah.
###293 MIKE: Can't complain.
###293 You're living for free and eating for free, right.
###295 EDDY MORETTI: Oh, living for free, really?
###297 MIKE: Yeah, yeah.
###297 EDDY MORETTI: No one pays, here?
###298 MIKE: No one pays, no.
###299 There's not a lot of work back east, eh.
###302 So that's why most of us come out here, so.
###303 EDDY MORETTI: And do a lot of people manage to save a lot of
###305 money and bring it back home.
###307 MIKE: Depends on the person, I guess.
###309 EDDY MORETTI: There isn't anything up here, though.
###311 What are they spending it on?
###312 I mean, we've been traveling around in this, you know--
###315 bar-- a night at the bar--
###316 MIKE: A night on the town, it'll cost you $500.
###318 EDDY MORETTI: Really?
###319 $500?
###319 What's $500?
###321 A human being can't drink $500 of booze.
###323 [LAUGHTER]
###323 EDDY MORETTI: What are we talking about?
###325 MIKE: $500--I guess you get the casino,
###328 your cabs, your liquor.
###330 there's the adult bars, right, the strip clubs.
###333 You throw your money away in there, pretty good.
###335 EDDY MORETTI: Well, that sounds like fun.
###339 I mean it just seems like, you know, odd for grown men to
###348 live like they're in a dorm, a college dorm.
###352 But if they're making a lot of money--
###354 Do they have hot tubs, here?
###357 MALE
###357 SPEAKER 2: No, [LAUGHTER]
###358 EDDY MORETTI: That could be good, though.
###359 MALE SPEAKER 2: No, not with 1,200 men, no.
###361 EDDY MORETTI: Oh yeah, shit, sorry.
###362 You know what, I was thinking about that.
###365 What's it like?
###366 MALE SPEAKER 2: Gym--
###366 I work in the gym.
###367 I'm on the computer, talk to my family at home, and just
###370 try and go to a movie downtown.
###371 But I try to stay away from the bars and the casino and
###374 that, because that's just--
###374 EDDY MORETTI: Why?
###374 MALE SPEAKER 2: Why?
###376 EDDY MORETTI: Yeah, what's the nightlife like, and what's the
###379 attitude and the--
###380 MALE SPEAKER 2: It's rough here.
###381 It's downtown.
###382 You have to be careful of yourself, where you go and
###384 what you do and what you spend.
###386 EDDY MORETTI: Mhm.
###386 MALE SPEAKER 2: A buddy of mine tried to-- almost got
###387 robbed there a couple of weeks ago, got jumped.
###389 People make big money here.
###390 And if you don't have anywhere to put it, you'll put a
###392 casino-- and you'll spend it on drink--
###395 on drugs, too.
###395 Drugs is very bad--
###396 EDDY MORETTI: Really?
###397 MALE SPEAKER 2: --out there.
###397 Oh yeah, you'll see a lot downtown, I have a daughter
###400 that's 3 1/2 years old--
###403 4 and 1/2 years old, and I was just talking to her, anyway.
###405 It's hard.
###406 It's hard on the family, but--
###408 My wife's a teacher, a French teacher, and she understands.
###411 I'm up there for both of us.
###412 And I'm not out wasting money.
###414 I'm putting it away and trying to pay off the bills.
###416 When you're making three times what you're making at home--
###418 EDDY MORETTI: Right.
###419 MALE SPEAKER 2: It's family life.
###420 EDDY MORETTI: How long you been here?
###422 MALE SPEAKER 2: Last year I was here about nine
###423 months in the camp.
###424 EDDY MORETTI: Yeah.
###425 
###427 We're going to get a chance to see what one of these places
###430 looks like.
###433 Could we take a look?
###435 MALE SPEAKER 3: Sure.
###435 Go ahead.
###437 It's how we live.
###437 It's pretty hard to beat it, when you're living--
###439 Your food is good.
###441 I've been back and forth for 10, 11 years, now.
###444 EDDY MORETTI: How does this compare to back then?
###448 MALE SPEAKER 3: Better, the food gets better, you know,
###450 and more people.
###451 But you know, my days are getting numbered, now, so--
###454 EDDY MORETTI: Why is that?
###455 MALE SPEAKER 3: Gotta retire, boy.
###456 EDDY MORETTI: Oh, good, that's great.
###458 And what are you going to do?
###459 What's your retirement plan?
###460 MALE SPEAKER 3: Going to grow marijuana down in Englishtown.
###463 [LAUGHTER]
###465 EDDY MORETTI: That's my brother.
###466 MALE SPEAKER 3: No, but I'm gonna reti--
###467 just relax.
###470 EDDY MORETTI: We started researching this story about
###472 the economic boom in Alberta, because of the oil industry.
###476 And primarily we were, you know, interested in the
###478 environmental side of the whole issue, but then when we
###481 started looking and researching, it started
###483 opening little, like, layers of the onion started
###487 unravelling.
###488 Gangs.
###489 
###493 Whoa.
###495 He's got some shit for us, already.
###497 
###500 This is interesting, here.
###504 What does this mean?
###505 Is this some kind of, like, martial arts--
###506 MALE SPEAKER 4: That's just, you know--
###507 EDDY MORETTI: --thing, and--
###508 MALE SPEAKER 4: Yeah, I don't know why.
###510 Where that came from, I can't tell you, for sure--
###513 likely out of a search warrant, or
###516 a search of a vehicle.
###518 EDDY MORETTI: Have you ever, sort of, seen the victim of
###522 some of these, like--
###523 this looks pretty brutal.
###525 MALE SPEAKER 4: Yeah.
###525 EDDY MORETTI: Yeah?
###526 MALE SPEAKER 4: Oh, yeah.
###526 Yeah.
###528 EDDY MORETTI: So It's kind of bloody, out there.
###531 We have quite a few criminal networks, otherwise known as
###535 street gangs--
###536 a bunch of kids who've gotten together.
###540 EDDY MORETTI: Any Italian gangs?
###542 MALE SPEAKER 4: Ah, not that I know of.
###543 EDDY MORETTI: No goombas, or anything like that--
###544 MALE SPEAKER 4: --Italian gang--
###545 EDDY MORETTI: No il Fratelli, il giavanotti,
###548 none of those guys?
###550 How much money is on the table, here?
###552 MALE SPEAKER 4: If you look right here, there is
###553 approximately, say-- there's approximately $2,500 to $3,000
###559 in cocaine, here.
###561 EDDY MORETTI: I heard that the drug trade that's tied into
###565 the, you know, boom, is worth about a million a month.
###569 MALE SPEAKER 4: A million dollars a month, street level,
###572 that would be low.
###573 EDDY MORETTI: Low?
###574 How much is going in one nostril and into their brain?
###578 MALE SPEAKER 4: This is
###578 methamphetamines, or crystal meth.
###580 This you don't want to swallow.
###582 EDDY MORETTI: That you don't want anywhere near any part of
###584 your body whatsoever.
###586 MALE SPEAKER 4: That's correct.
###586 EDDY MORETTI: Interesting.
###588 Is that good?
###590 I think we're good.
###591 
###595 So this is it, you know.
###596 This is what it's come to.
###598 We're scraping the bottom of the planetary barrel for the
###602 worst kind of oil, which means this is what we've come to--
###607 subzero trailer parks in the middle of fucking Canadian
###612 arctic in order to supply our thirst for fuel.
###617 That's it.
###618 Mark your fucking territory.
###620 I have--
###621 there's not enough housing up here, so people end up buying
###624 or renting trailers.
###625 They're even renting plots of land, over here.
###629 They have about 300 spots in this trailer park.
###635 The average rent is, like, $1,200 a month to live in the
###639 middle of nowhere.
###641 
###644 I would go fucking ape-shit out here.
###648 I wish someone would come out and, like, welcome us.
###652 MALE SPEAKER 5: Well, I started in June.
###655 I was living in an apartment back home.
###657 I couldn't get nowhere.
###658 I had no way to jump-start my life.
###660 I have a family and kids I couldn't support, so--
###664 EDDY MORETTI: You do what you have to do.
###666 MALE SPEAKER 5: Hey, I hate--
###668 look at the stacks, what they're throwing into the air.
###670 Sometimes--
###670 EDDY MORETTI: It's terrible.
###670 MALE SPEAKER 5: --you wake up here in the daytime, and it
###673 smells like crude in the air in the summertime.
###675 But if they say to you, "hey, I know you hate what all these
###678 plants are doing up here, but hey, I could give you enough
###682 money to support your family.
###684 I can give you enough money to live happily in your own
###686 house."
###688 Every man has his price, and basically, I see it as, they
###691 pay us just enough to keep our mouth shut, to come here, to
###694 do our work and go home.
###695 Would I rather raise my family here or back home?
###698 See, if I raise them here, I'm probably going to
###700 be living in this.
###700 EDDY MORETTI: Right.
###701 MALE SPEAKER 5: Back home, I had a nice--
###703 EDDY MORETTI: Nice apartment, nice place.
###704 MALE SPEAKER 5: Everybody came over all the time, now I don't
###706 see no one.
###706 I don't go out.
###708 EDDY MORETTI: Are you depressed?
###710 MALE SPEAKER 5: No.
###710 Sometimes it does get to you.
###712 EDDY MORETTI: Yeah.
###712 MALE SPEAKER 5: It really gets to you, but--
###715 EDDY MORETTI: Do you have a girlfriend here?
###716 MALE SPEAKER 5: Nope, one was supposed to come out with me,
###718 and uh, she took off.
###721 EDDY MORETTI: This doesn't seem like a healthy place.
###723 MALE SPEAKER 5: This isn't a town I want to live in.
###725 EDDY MORETTI: Right.
###725 There's no future.
###727 MALE SPEAKER 5: There's future in this town.
###729 There's a helluva lot of money to be made.
###730 EDDY MORETTI: There's not a future for a
###732 guy like you, though?
###733 MALE SPEAKER 5: Well, do you want money, or do you want
###734 live a happy life in, like, a nice little land, somewhere,
###737 with your wife and your couple of kids.
###739 EDDY MORETTI: What are you going to take
###740 away from this place?
###742 MALE SPEAKER 5: Uh, take away from this place--
###743 I'm up here to make my own money.
###745 I'm not up here to screw anyone.
###748 I'm not bringing much to this community, although I like to
###751 provide them a service.
###754 But this community doesn't really do much for you.
###760 I'm not here to be nice to anyone.
###762 I'm not going to screw anyone, but at the end of the day,
###764 it's for me.
###766 But I'm not coming up here just to rape the land and
###771 everything else like that.
###772 I'm up here to make a go at my life and to live on my own.
###776 
###779 PAULA OYONOSKI: Well the publication is almost like
###780 putting a human face on the oil sands, who is extracting
###784 the energy, where do they come from, why are they doing it
###786 You know, people come here and get a really quick glimpse.
###789 You know, and we've had a lot of outside media, they get
###792 their thoughts and views from bars, and it's such a small
###796 snippet of this community.
###797 And I think that's frustrating for a lot of people.
###799 EDDY MORETTI: Right.
###799 PAULA OYONOSKI: You know that's one of the things
###801 outside media has, sort of, pointed at us for--
###802 make money.
###803 But it's one of those things that-- it's almost too bad,
###807 because people come here not planning ahead, expecting that
###810 they can come here and get a place to live and get a
###812 $100,000 job, "like that."
###815 And the fact of the matter is you have to look ahead and
###817 find accommodations, because it's hard to find
###819 accommodations, here.
###820 And I think that's where a lot of people run into problems.
###823 BRYAN LUTES: Well, we are a not-for-profit corporation--
###825 EDDY MORETTI: Yeah.
###826 BRYAN LUTES: --that's set up to do housing--
###827 EDDY MORETTI: Right.
###828 BRYAN LUTES: --throughout the community.
###830 A one bedroom apartment here is $1,500 to $1,800 a month if
###833 you can find one.
###834 Average 3-bedroom bungalow is $480,000.
###836 EDDY MORETTI: That's ridiculous.
###838 That's-- you can get a nice apartment in Manhattan.
###840 BRYAN LUTES: You can't find a trailer,
###841 here, for under $300,000.
###843 EDDY MORETTI: So it's kind of out of control.
###845 BRYAN LUTES: Well, median income here is $93,000 a year.
###849 Anybody under $70,000 a year needs some sort of assistance
###852 with housing.
###853 EDDY MORETTI: So if I took my salary from New
###854 York, I would be under--
###857 BRYAN LUTES: You would--
###857 EDDY MORETTI: I would need assistance--
###857 BRYAN LUTES: You would need some assistance, here.
###859 EDDY MORETTI: Cool.
###861 Hello.
###861 MIKE #2: Hi.
###862 EDDY MORETTI: Hey, I'm Eddy.
###863 MIKE #2: What's up, man.
###864 EDDY MORETTI: What's your name.
###865 MIKE #2: Mike.
###865 EDDY MORETTI: Mike, what's up?
###867 ANTHONY: Hey, I'm Anthony.
###867 EDDY MORETTI: How you doing, buddy?
###868 ANTHONY: Good, how are you?
###869 EDDY MORETTI: What's up?
###870 ANTHONY: My best friend in the whole world said, "oh, come on
###872 up for the oil, already, right."
###874 EDDY MORETTI: And what--
###875 ANTHONY: "--in the oil field, you could make this and that
###877 up on site, and blah blah blah." So it was the
###880 big hype, and then--
###883 here I am, now.
###883 Here I am, here, I struggled.
###886 I went to the Salvation Army, and that
###888 was quite the struggle.
###889 At 7:30, they kick you out every morning, regardless.
###893 EDDY MORETTI: Really?
###893 ANTHONY: Minus 40, minus 50, regardless, every day.
###897 EDDY MORETTI: Why?
###897 ANTHONY: Seven days a week.
###899 They just want you out.
###901 So you had-- and then this place opened up, and it's a
###905 real blessing, this place-- the Marshall House.
###907 EDDY MORETTI: Right.
###908 ANTHONY: It all gathers into one thing, this town--
###911 EDDY MORETTI: Oil.
###913 ANTHONY: It's money.
###914 It's money.
###915 It's money.
###916 It's a very greedy town, to be honest with you.
###918 EDDY MORETTI: Yeah.
###919 ANTHONY: Walking down the road all the time, I used to be,
###921 like, why can't I have that.
###922 EDDY
###922 MORETTI: Right [LAUGHTER]
###923 ANTHONY: Why can't I have that vehicle?
###925 EDDY MORETTI: Slowly, you can.
###926 ANTHONY: Why can't I have a house?
###927 You know what I mean, though, like it's kind of degrading.
###928 It's, like, shit.
###930 You know, you're sitting there kicking cans, walking down the
###932 road, homeless.
###934 And here's Joe Blow driving by in an
###936 $80,000 or $70,000 truck.
###940 I really want to just get up on site.
###942 EDDY MORETTI: Yeah.
###943 ANTHONY: You know, that's my ultimate goal.
###945 It's just to start making a bit of money and have a life
###947 I've never had, you know.
###950 BRYAN LUTES: We're projecting 8%, 9% growth a year for the
###953 next three to five years.
###955 EDDY MORETTI: Right.
###955 BRYAN LUTES: Without going past that date, which is
###957 phenomenal.
###958 EDDY MORETTI: Which is too much--
###959 BRYAN LUTES: I mean, most large cities, if they're
###961 growing 2% or 3%--
###962 EDDY MORETTI: 2% or 3%.
###962 BRYAN LUTES: --think It's barely sustainable.
###964 We're at 9%.
###966 EDDY MORETTI: Given, like, the real estate market, here, if
###968 you wanted to, you could charge a lot of money for
###971 these units, and you could be a very rich man.
###974 BRYAN LUTES: I've been in the development and property
###975 management business for many years, and the opportunity
###979 came up to do what I love doing for a really good cause.
###984 And one case in particular was a lady that was in a tent on
###988 the river, came in, got her stuff together,
###991 got her life together--
###993 EDDY MORETTI: Tent on the river in the winter?
###994 BRYAN LUTES: In the winter, oh yeah.
###995 It's not uncommon.
###996 We can take you down--
###996 EDDY MORETTI: Can you take us down?
###997 BRYAN LUTES: We can go down to the river and
###999 see this right now.
