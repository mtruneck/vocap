###0 senator roger wicker's office was apparently sent a letter containing rice
###4 in which the proximal poison
###7 sent roger wicker
###10 many of the number-one uh... intended obviously so i'm not impair your butt
###15 if you're in a room with me and a bet you do you know what's the news from
###18 his mother fought more secure senators there are
###21 his from mississippi doesn't get him on the lotto legislation
###24 so why in the world with somebody send headquarters
###27 well it's interesting well an especially right after the bombings in boston so
###32 first off of course everyone is if there's a connection
###35 obviously we don't know yet
###37 i've actually honestly surprised at how
###39 low-key restless and as i do have been briefed on it
###43 apparently think that they're confident that everything's gonna be okay that's
###47 what they are all saying
###48 uh... and they think it might be someone did
###51 has sent men
###53 we ordered threatening letters in the past
###55 previous senators so could just be alone wall they could be somebody
###59 they're just took advantage of the
###61 balmy situation did
###63 scare more people could be headed got absolutely nothing to do it
###66 yeah they did have something to it well and those two things are connected that
###70 makes it law much less likely that is a four attack
###74 just because they don't believe there's a single foreigner who knows who roger
###77 workers
###79 uh... any foreign country that men to do was formerly forum group allocate or
###83 otherwise
###85 media pay pal roger wicker in the senate directory
###89 hi would have been surprise what why of all people send him rice in
###94 isn't in my by set up in the way there if there is ample art
###98 he was one of the senators republican senators
###101 that voted to get past the filibuster on gun control legislation
###106 there's a big crazy enough
###108 percent somebody poison
###110 because they just wooden block a debate on an issue he's likely to vote against
###114 the bill
###115 among
###116 is that enough for some crazy brazil is an important
###119 who knows so superior out there right now but
###123 coming right after the bombings
###125 it reminds of course of
###127 nine eleven then right after another anthrax attacks again senators against
###131 members of the media so obviously never was rightfully very concerned who's even
###135 reports earlier
###137 but today the white house had been cleared
###139 while the government facials all the press et-cetera to make sure that there
###143 was that uh... that an unattended package was saying carava make sure that
###146 was not a bomb
###147 so everybody's on edge here but it is very curious
###151 the united states and around the worker bees sent this obviously terrible thank
###156 god they caught it before heard anybody
###158 there was caught in the screening facility outside of congress
###162 so uh... thank god that nobody got hurt
###164 but it is awfully strange in we hope that it doesn't happen again
###167 and it's all this mystery
