[CAR ENGINE]


3
0:0:21,45 --> 0:0:24,4
CHRIS HARRIS: I've wanted to
drive a Singer 911 from the


4
0:0:24,4 --> 0:0:27,53
moment I first saw the car
several years ago.


5
0:0:27,53 --> 0:0:30,57
And finally the chance
has arrived.


6
0:0:30,57 --> 0:0:35,2
This is a machine rooted in
passion, obsession, and


7
0:0:35,2 --> 0:0:36,31
perfection.


8
0:0:36,31 --> 0:0:39,54
Each Singer is born in this
shed somewhere in LA.


9
0:0:39,54 --> 0:0:42,31
We're going to spend some time
with the man behind the car,


10
0:0:42,31 --> 0:0:45,2
Rob Dickinson, and then we're
going to drive it on some


11
0:0:45,2 --> 0:0:49,275
Californian twisties, and then
we'll take it to a circuit and


12
0:0:49,275 --> 0:0:51,43
let it move around
a little more.


13
0:0:51,43 --> 0:0:55,17
And by the end of the show, I
sincerely hope that you will


14
0:0:55,17 --> 0:0:58,36
feel you've seen what goes
into making one of these


15
0:0:58,36 --> 0:1:1,458
gorgeous machines.


16
0:1:1,458 --> 0:1:3,593
ROB DICKINSON: If you come in
here, this is what the car was


17
0:1:3,593 --> 0:1:5,99
going to look like.


18
0:1:5,99 --> 0:1:8,65
I started to think,
why can't--


19
0:1:8,65 --> 0:1:10,99
you've got this wonderful
interchangeability of parts in


20
0:1:10,99 --> 0:1:12,54
the air-cooled era.


21
0:1:12,54 --> 0:1:15,58
Why can't you try and create--


22
0:1:15,58 --> 0:1:17,55
I know you wouldn't want to
use the word "market," but


23
0:1:17,55 --> 0:1:19,71
suggest to the world that
maybe there could be a


24
0:1:19,71 --> 0:1:22,6
possible ultimate 911.


25
0:1:22,6 --> 0:1:24,6
So cherry pick from all of
these wonderful parts.


26
0:1:24,6 --> 0:1:27,4
Let's take the best engine,
shove it in the best chassis,


27
0:1:27,4 --> 0:1:30,63
put the best brakes on it, best,
best, best, best, best.


28
0:1:30,63 --> 0:1:32,72
Develop it properly, so
it doesn't feel like a


29
0:1:32,72 --> 0:1:34,28
Frankenstein car.


30
0:1:34,28 --> 0:1:36,41
And then present it to the
world, to a bunch of guys that


31
0:1:36,41 --> 0:1:38,59
maybe have never driven
a proper, sorted


32
0:1:38,59 --> 0:1:41,17
air-cooled car before.


33
0:1:41,17 --> 0:1:43,95
And then it snowballed, and the
wheels became available.


34
0:1:43,95 --> 0:1:45,6
And we thought, ah, bigger
wheels, bigger brakes.


35
0:1:45,6 --> 0:1:47,77
And as you can imagine, the
slippery slope started.


36
0:1:47,77 --> 0:1:51,49
But this is a car that we'd
still like to investigate.


37
0:1:51,49 --> 0:1:54,97
A simpler car, a less exotic
car, a less extravagant car.


38
0:1:54,97 --> 0:1:57,82
Still beautifully executed
and beautifully done.


39
0:1:57,82 --> 0:1:59,63
Maybe sold in a modular way.


40
0:1:59,63 --> 0:2:4,73
So we sell a body kit, and we
sell a wheel and brake package


41
0:2:4,73 --> 0:2:5,79
and a suspension package.


42
0:2:5,79 --> 0:2:8,71
All nicely boxed so people
get stuff that's


43
0:2:8,71 --> 0:2:9,485
been properly developed.


44
0:2:9,485 --> 0:2:11,27
They screw it on and it works.


45
0:2:11,27 --> 0:2:14,39
A lot of these guys are at the
mercy of some of these Porsche


46
0:2:14,39 --> 0:2:18,66
shops by having stuff screwed
on that hasn't necessarily


47
0:2:18,66 --> 0:2:20,31
been developed to work
as a team, and all


48
0:2:20,31 --> 0:2:21,16
that kind of stuff.


49
0:2:21,16 --> 0:2:26,59
We think that maybe we can use
the big, fancy car as a


50
0:2:26,59 --> 0:2:27,48
trickle down thing.


51
0:2:27,48 --> 0:2:30,62
So maybe we can offer something
to guys like me who


52
0:2:30,62 --> 0:2:31,85
can't afford what we do.


53
0:2:31,85 --> 0:2:35,97
Kind of grassroots guys who love
these things but maybe


54
0:2:35,97 --> 0:2:38,57
appreciate what we've done with
this crazy car, but it's


55
0:2:38,57 --> 0:2:41,14
obviously maybe not something
that they can afford.


56
0:2:41,14 --> 0:2:43,952
And do something that I can
afford and they can afford.


57
0:2:43,952 --> 0:2:46,61
CHRIS HARRIS: That's me.


58
0:2:46,61 --> 0:2:51,4
ROB DICKINSON: And that's maybe
plan B for next year.


59
0:2:51,4 --> 0:2:53,1
Give you some idea of--


60
0:2:53,1 --> 0:2:54,63
CHRIS HARRIS: You've got
to see this Mac.


61
0:2:54,63 --> 0:2:56,691
Come look at his Mac.


62
0:2:56,691 --> 0:2:57,22
This is a [BLEEP]


63
0:2:57,22 --> 0:2:58,71
war zone.


64
0:2:58,71 --> 0:3:0,7
ROB DICKINSON: Sorry
about that.


65
0:3:0,7 --> 0:3:4,18
So these are the early days.


66
0:3:4,18 --> 0:3:7,8
These are the early days,
clay modeling.


67
0:3:7,8 --> 0:3:9,37
We wanted to sketch one side
of the car in here.


68
0:3:9,37 --> 0:3:13,16
So this is the '88 3.2 Carrera
that became the orange car.


69
0:3:13,16 --> 0:3:15,6
So this is our early--


70
0:3:15,6 --> 0:3:17,86
we'd just got the 17-inch
wheels, [INAUDIBLE]


71
0:3:17,86 --> 0:3:18,88
prototypes.


72
0:3:18,88 --> 0:3:20,49
CHRIS HARRIS: It was all just
hand clay sculpted.


73
0:3:20,49 --> 0:3:22,9
ROB DICKINSON: Hand
clay sculpted.


74
0:3:22,9 --> 0:3:25,76
So anyway, so we sketched
the car in here.


75
0:3:25,76 --> 0:3:27,49
And then we took it to the


76
0:3:27,49 --> 0:3:29,99
prototyping facility in Irvine--


77
0:3:29,99 --> 0:3:31,42
Aria Group--


78
0:3:31,42 --> 0:3:36,15
who then digitized one side.


79
0:3:36,15 --> 0:3:40,7
And then we clayed the other
side of the car.


80
0:3:40,7 --> 0:3:42,286
Just see, it's starting to
make a lot of sense.


81
0:3:42,286 --> 0:3:44,61
That took us a year.


82
0:3:44,61 --> 0:3:45,812
A year of [BLEEP]


83
0:3:45,812 --> 0:3:47,17
work.


84
0:3:47,17 --> 0:3:48,1
Going, I'm going to [BLEEP]


85
0:3:48,1 --> 0:3:48,6
this car up.


86
0:3:48,6 --> 0:3:51,1
Everyone is going to laugh at me
if I don't get this right.


87
0:3:51,1 --> 0:3:52,39
Total stressing.


88
0:3:52,39 --> 0:3:54,59
The first set of molds for
the first two cars were


89
0:3:54,59 --> 0:3:56,1
lifted off the clay.


90
0:3:56,1 --> 0:4:2,14
And then when we realized that
we were going to move to the


91
0:4:2,14 --> 0:4:5,46
964 chassis, we had to
redo everything.


92
0:4:5,46 --> 0:4:8,94
But this company spent a whole
month and a ton of our money


93
0:4:8,94 --> 0:4:10,17
to get the 964.


94
0:4:10,17 --> 0:4:11,99
Because we had to retool
for the 964


95
0:4:11,99 --> 0:4:12,71
because of the wheelbase.


96
0:4:12,71 --> 0:4:14,35
CHRIS HARRIS: Did you have
to do everything again?


97
0:4:14,35 --> 0:4:15,14
ROB DICKINSON: The wheelbase
was different.


98
0:4:15,14 --> 0:4:16,47
I've got photographs of that
if you want to see


99
0:4:16,47 --> 0:4:17,3
[INAUDIBLE].


100
0:4:17,3 --> 0:4:19,17
CHRIS HARRIS: That's
just nuts.


101
0:4:19,17 --> 0:4:20,43
ROB DICKINSON: The idea
was just to clean


102
0:4:20,43 --> 0:4:21,69
it up a little bit.


103
0:4:21,69 --> 0:4:25,51
Take some of the jowls out of
it, and just give it a little


104
0:4:25,51 --> 0:4:29,18
bit of a nip and tuck.


105
0:4:29,18 --> 0:4:32,86
CHRIS HARRIS: And that ended
up taking two years and


106
0:4:32,86 --> 0:4:35,382
hundreds of thousands
of dollars.


107
0:4:35,382 --> 0:4:36,632
ROB DICKINSON: Yeah.


108
0:4:36,632 --> 0:4:40,82



109
0:4:40,82 --> 0:4:43,88
When we first came up with this
idea to do this Singer


110
0:4:43,88 --> 0:4:45,57
thing, it was going
to have these.


111
0:4:45,57 --> 0:4:48,81
It was going to be a 15-inch
wheeled car.


112
0:4:48,81 --> 0:4:49,86
CHRIS HARRIS: But
you could do it.


113
0:4:49,86 --> 0:4:50,66
That's what we did.


114
0:4:50,66 --> 0:4:51,52
ROB DICKINSON: Yeah.


115
0:4:51,52 --> 0:4:54,43
And then these wheels came
along, and we started to


116
0:4:54,43 --> 0:4:56,35
think, wow, bigger wheels
means bigger brakes.


117
0:4:56,35 --> 0:4:58,87



118
0:4:58,87 --> 0:5:0,69
Opens up a few possibilities.


119
0:5:0,69 --> 0:5:6,23
We knew these tires were cool,
but, as you say, compromised.


120
0:5:6,23 --> 0:5:16,14
We wanted to use the 270/45 on
a 9-inch rim, which I think


121
0:5:16,14 --> 0:5:18,15
you probably put this tire
on your 9 inch on the


122
0:5:18,15 --> 0:5:19,4
back of your car.


123
0:5:19,4 --> 0:5:22,32



124
0:5:22,32 --> 0:5:24,63
So, anyway, I had some special
10-inch wheels made up.


125
0:5:24,63 --> 0:5:30,97
So this is a 10 by 15 Fuchs,
cut and welded here for the


126
0:5:30,97 --> 0:5:34,11
purposes of the prototyping
that we were going to do.


127
0:5:34,11 --> 0:5:37,28
And I just wanted that perfect
kind of stretch.


128
0:5:37,28 --> 0:5:38,65
CHRIS HARRIS: That is
perfect, isn't it.


129
0:5:38,65 --> 0:5:40,93
ROB DICKINSON: Didn't look
like it was too chubby.


130
0:5:40,93 --> 0:5:42,56
Didn't look like
it was a ricer,


131
0:5:42,56 --> 0:5:46,54
kind of overly stretched.


132
0:5:46,54 --> 0:5:48,81
But I tell you what, Chris,
the guy that does these


133
0:5:48,81 --> 0:5:52,15
wheels, Harvey Weidman, is--


134
0:5:52,15 --> 0:5:55,455
he does these wheels and
everyone calls them works of


135
0:5:55,455 --> 0:5:57,54
art, and they are.


136
0:5:57,54 --> 0:6:0,395
In my view, the wheels
maketh the car.


137
0:6:0,395 --> 0:6:2,71
The wheels and the tires
maketh any car.


138
0:6:2,71 --> 0:6:3,89
You can have the [BLEEP]


139
0:6:3,89 --> 0:6:5,445
car in the world, you put
the right wheel and tire


140
0:6:5,445 --> 0:6:8,86
combination on it, suddenly
it goes, oh, I fancy that.


141
0:6:8,86 --> 0:6:10,97
You know that.


142
0:6:10,97 --> 0:6:12,45
CHRIS HARRIS: And, obviously,
their relationship to the body


143
0:6:12,45 --> 0:6:12,98
work as well.


144
0:6:12,98 --> 0:6:14,2
ROB DICKINSON: Exactly.


145
0:6:14,2 --> 0:6:16,48
CHRIS HARRIS: Without wanting
to bring it down to a base


146
0:6:16,48 --> 0:6:20,1
level, they just look
right, don't they?


147
0:6:20,1 --> 0:6:20,51
ROB DICKINSON: Yeah.


148
0:6:20,51 --> 0:6:25,44
I mean, the car has to look
planted and confident.


149
0:6:25,44 --> 0:6:28,23
There's a confidence to the
car, I think, which people


150
0:6:28,23 --> 0:6:29,44
immediately pick up on.


151
0:6:29,44 --> 0:6:30,72
I don't think there's--


152
0:6:30,72 --> 0:6:32,62
it's difficult for people to
quantify and put their finger


153
0:6:32,62 --> 0:6:34,71
on it sometimes, but there's
a confidence.


154
0:6:34,71 --> 0:6:37,1
We didn't want to create
an overly aggressive,


155
0:6:37,1 --> 0:6:39,37
macho-looking 911.


156
0:6:39,37 --> 0:6:42,3
911's, to me, have always had
a friendly face and a


157
0:6:42,3 --> 0:6:44,5
businesslike rear.


158
0:6:44,5 --> 0:6:47,56
And we wanted to retain that.


159
0:6:47,56 --> 0:6:53,4
We wanted the car to not scare
girls and for it to be not


160
0:6:53,4 --> 0:6:59,26
just a male, red-blooded thing,
but to be beautiful.


161
0:6:59,26 --> 0:7:4,15
If ever a car authentically and
truthfully betrayed its


162
0:7:4,15 --> 0:7:6,52
underpinnings, it's
the Porsche 911.


163
0:7:6,52 --> 0:7:8,6
It's shaped--


164
0:7:8,6 --> 0:7:9,455
it's got no engine
at the front, so


165
0:7:9,455 --> 0:7:11,29
it's got no high bonnet.


166
0:7:11,29 --> 0:7:14,4
It's got round headlights,
because they're the most


167
0:7:14,4 --> 0:7:14,94
functional and efficient.


168
0:7:14,94 --> 0:7:18,27
An engine at the back,
and the body shape


169
0:7:18,27 --> 0:7:19,44
suggests that it has.


170
0:7:19,44 --> 0:7:22,62
It's got enough space for four
people, at a pinch, inside.


171
0:7:22,62 --> 0:7:23,97
It is the car.


172
0:7:23,97 --> 0:7:26,43
It is the only car you could
potentially have to have in


173
0:7:26,43 --> 0:7:27,505
your collection.


174
0:7:27,505 --> 0:7:31,77
And the whole deal with the
Singer was to try and create a


175
0:7:31,77 --> 0:7:34,94
wonderful compromise where we
pulled in all these fabulous


176
0:7:34,94 --> 0:7:38,26
things from the air-cooled era
to make one car that you


177
0:7:38,26 --> 0:7:40,28
could-- if you only had to have
one car in your garage,


178
0:7:40,28 --> 0:7:42,88
and maybe you'd like to take it
to the track occasionally.


179
0:7:42,88 --> 0:7:45,27
Maybe you'd like to put your
kids in the back occasionally.


180
0:7:45,27 --> 0:7:47,95
Maybe you'd like to commute
to in it occasionally.


181
0:7:47,95 --> 0:7:52,52
Maybe, the wonderful duality
that is the 911, we could turn


182
0:7:52,52 --> 0:7:56,295
the volume up a little bit and
make it as sexy, as desirable,


183
0:7:56,295 --> 0:7:59,72
as efficient, and as
fast as possible.


184
0:7:59,72 --> 0:8:3,15
And that's what the car's
about, really.


185
0:8:3,15 --> 0:8:4,75
CHRIS HARRIS: I can't say
any more than that.


186
0:8:4,75 --> 0:8:8,66
It's a very, very, erudite
description of what is, in


187
0:8:8,66 --> 0:8:12,336
layman's terms, just
a plain horny car.


188
0:8:12,336 --> 0:8:13,56
ROB DICKINSON: Thank you.


189
0:8:13,56 --> 0:8:13,994
CHRIS HARRIS: Lovely.


190
0:8:13,994 --> 0:8:16,164
Lovely, lovely, lovely.


191
0:8:16,164 --> 0:8:18,72
Now look, I could have talked to
Rob about the gestation of


192
0:8:18,72 --> 0:8:20,345
this car for hours.


193
0:8:20,345 --> 0:8:22,7
And it's clear that Rob could
have reciprocated the favor


194
0:8:22,7 --> 0:8:25,21
because it basically
involved discussing


195
0:8:25,21 --> 0:8:27,36
every cool car in existence.


196
0:8:27,36 --> 0:8:31,61
But there comes a point when
reality beats theory, and I


197
0:8:31,61 --> 0:8:33,659
just wanted to drive
the car itself.


198
0:8:33,659 --> 0:8:39,7
I really wanted to drive
the car itself.


199
0:8:39,7 --> 0:8:40,95
The Singer on the road.


200
0:8:40,95 --> 0:8:45,33
Well, first of all, we've got
quite a firm ride on this car.


201
0:8:45,33 --> 0:8:46,93
It's solidly mounted at
the back side, no


202
0:8:46,93 --> 0:8:48,51
bushings or rose jointed--


203
0:8:48,51 --> 0:8:49,15
quite busy.


204
0:8:49,15 --> 0:8:50,29
But the [INAUDIBLE]
isn't too bad.


205
0:8:50,29 --> 0:8:52,65
It's got all that sound
deadening in it.


206
0:8:52,65 --> 0:8:53,38
Steering--


207
0:8:53,38 --> 0:8:56,89
direct and power assisted, but
this lovely little prototypal


208
0:8:56,89 --> 0:8:59,3
wheel just wriggles around.


209
0:8:59,3 --> 0:9:1,19
If you're someone that's
bemoaning the lack of


210
0:9:1,19 --> 0:9:4,22
hydraulic assisted steering in
a 911, don't come and drive


211
0:9:4,22 --> 0:9:6,8
one of these, because it's just
going to make you feel


212
0:9:6,8 --> 0:9:8,67
even more angry about
electric steering.


213
0:9:8,67 --> 0:9:13,1
Noise, well, yeah,
it's all there.


214
0:9:13,1 --> 0:9:14,8
This engine is lovely.


215
0:9:14,8 --> 0:9:15,75
Nice road car engine as well.


216
0:9:15,75 --> 0:9:17,9
This car's got quite
short gearing.


217
0:9:17,9 --> 0:9:20,18
So, first, second, third,
nice and short.


218
0:9:20,18 --> 0:9:22,74
Gives you load of punch
out of slower turns.


219
0:9:22,74 --> 0:9:25,362
Gearshift Itself
is exceptional.


220
0:9:25,362 --> 0:9:29,29
They've taken the standard 964
shifter, taken as much rubber


221
0:9:29,29 --> 0:9:30,89
out of it as possible,
made it really


222
0:9:30,89 --> 0:9:32,802
direct, and it's lovely.


223
0:9:32,802 --> 0:9:38,6
[CAR ENGINE]


224
0:9:38,6 --> 0:9:41,69
CHRIS HARRIS: On a windy,
little, mountain road in


225
0:9:41,69 --> 0:9:46,31
California, in
uncharacteristically bad


226
0:9:46,31 --> 0:9:49,8
weather, it has to be
said, [INAUDIBLE]


227
0:9:49,8 --> 0:9:50,898
lots of traction.


228
0:9:50,898 --> 0:9:54,8
Lots of traction.


229
0:9:54,8 --> 0:9:56,46
It feels very 911 at the
front, but nicely so.


230
0:9:56,46 --> 0:9:59,23



231
0:9:59,23 --> 0:10:0,6
Oh, yes.


232
0:10:0,6 --> 0:10:2,766
Oh, yes.


233
0:10:2,766 --> 0:10:3,88
Do you know what?


234
0:10:3,88 --> 0:10:7,8
There's a sense of occasion
sitting in it, which kind of


235
0:10:7,8 --> 0:10:8,76
makes you overlook some
of the stuff.


236
0:10:8,76 --> 0:10:11,95
Knowing what we know about the
underpinnings, there's so much


237
0:10:11,95 --> 0:10:15,3
you can do with the dampers and
the springs anyway, you


238
0:10:15,3 --> 0:10:17,49
could get this car to handle,
I think, pretty much the way


239
0:10:17,49 --> 0:10:18,23
you want it to.


240
0:10:18,23 --> 0:10:21,22
And it's really not far
off the way it is now.


241
0:10:21,22 --> 0:10:22,773
They haven't even started
doing the full


242
0:10:22,773 --> 0:10:24,23
testing on this car yet.


243
0:10:24,23 --> 0:10:26,54



244
0:10:26,54 --> 0:10:30,185
The engine's lovely,
just lovely.


245
0:10:30,185 --> 0:10:30,66
Wow.


246
0:10:30,66 --> 0:10:32,34
There's some nice scenery
around here.


247
0:10:32,34 --> 0:10:36,21



248
0:10:36,21 --> 0:10:41,64
Oh, I know I crap on about it,
but older 911's are such


249
0:10:41,64 --> 0:10:45,11
lovely cars, and they make
amazing bases for these kind


250
0:10:45,11 --> 0:10:47,411
of exercises.


251
0:10:47,411 --> 0:10:48,842
What a car.


252
0:10:48,842 --> 0:10:52,19
What a car.


253
0:10:52,19 --> 0:10:54,18
You could live with this
every single day.


254
0:10:54,18 --> 0:10:55,31
It's lovely.


255
0:10:55,31 --> 0:10:56,45
The cabin.


256
0:10:56,45 --> 0:10:57,85
I want to tell you
about this cabin.


257
0:10:57,85 --> 0:11:0,47
You need to sit in it with
me to feel the quality,


258
0:11:0,47 --> 0:11:2,48
to smell the hide.


259
0:11:2,48 --> 0:11:6,55
It's just utterly, utterly
beautiful.


260
0:11:6,55 --> 0:11:8,65
And people look at it.


261
0:11:8,65 --> 0:11:11,49
They really, really
look at it.


262
0:11:11,49 --> 0:11:14,78



263
0:11:14,78 --> 0:11:19,725
As a road car, it's a nice
balance of fun, excitement,


264
0:11:19,725 --> 0:11:21,76
but competence.


265
0:11:21,76 --> 0:11:23,65
Special mention for the sound
deadening, as well.


266
0:11:23,65 --> 0:11:26,29
This is much, much quieter
than I ever got my


267
0:11:26,29 --> 0:11:28,2
green 911 to be.


268
0:11:28,2 --> 0:11:30,5
Although it's quite booming
in the exhaust area.


269
0:11:30,5 --> 0:11:32,44
Again, I think a bit more
on the exhaust.


270
0:11:32,44 --> 0:11:36,98
It's just a really
nice place to be.


271
0:11:36,98 --> 0:11:42,56
But is it a bit better on
a more open race track?


272
0:11:42,56 --> 0:11:46,95
I suppose we have to go and
find out, don't we?


273
0:11:46,95 --> 0:11:49,456
Now hold that thought
for a second.


274
0:11:49,456 --> 0:11:53,12
Before we get ragged on the
circuit, you need to witness


275
0:11:53,12 --> 0:11:59,4
the crazy level of detail
invested in each Singer.


276
0:11:59,4 --> 0:12:2,24
Maz here is the fountain of
all knowledge about what's


277
0:12:2,24 --> 0:12:3,89
happened to the car, and
why they did what,


278
0:12:3,89 --> 0:12:4,44
and everything else.


279
0:12:4,44 --> 0:12:6,63
And we discussed earlier that he
was a tits, rather than an


280
0:12:6,63 --> 0:12:9,18
ass man, so we're going to start
at the front of the car.


281
0:12:9,18 --> 0:12:9,95
OK?


282
0:12:9,95 --> 0:12:11,96
Right.


283
0:12:11,96 --> 0:12:13,17
This doesn't look right to me.


284
0:12:13,17 --> 0:12:13,55
-It's not.


285
0:12:13,55 --> 0:12:15,11
CHRIS HARRIS: I know
the inside of 911.


286
0:12:15,11 --> 0:12:17,71
This has been played with.


287
0:12:17,71 --> 0:12:21,14
-Well, to begin with, we
use the long hood.


288
0:12:21,14 --> 0:12:24,44
So the latch for the
964 is about here.


289
0:12:24,44 --> 0:12:27,815
So we cut that piece out
and we buy the latch


290
0:12:27,815 --> 0:12:29,23
from the early car.


291
0:12:29,23 --> 0:12:31,966
However, we have to accommodate
for lots and lots


292
0:12:31,966 --> 0:12:34,29
and lots of cooling
down below.


293
0:12:34,29 --> 0:12:35,96
So we've built this box.


294
0:12:35,96 --> 0:12:40,22
Actually, the fabrication
starts about there.


295
0:12:40,22 --> 0:12:43,7
And we remap the ABS unit where
it belongs and try to


296
0:12:43,7 --> 0:12:47,16
make it look like it
was born that way.


297
0:12:47,16 --> 0:12:49,14
CHRIS HARRIS: So we've got lots
of cooling going under


298
0:12:49,14 --> 0:12:50,76
here which is beautiful--
we did some cut away


299
0:12:50,76 --> 0:12:51,94
so you can see that--


300
0:12:51,94 --> 0:12:54,55
but, little fan units.


301
0:12:54,55 --> 0:12:58,61
The build quality is very
much motorsport.


302
0:12:58,61 --> 0:13:0,13
It just looks like a
racing car to me.


303
0:13:0,13 --> 0:13:2,7
It looks like a beautifully
built racing car.


304
0:13:2,7 --> 0:13:5,37
Which is apt because these
light units are from a--


305
0:13:5,37 --> 0:13:6,59
-LMP.


306
0:13:6,59 --> 0:13:11,59
Hella has an LMP unit that
they supply to everybody.


307
0:13:11,59 --> 0:13:13,7
CHRIS HARRIS: And it's because
it will go up and down for


308
0:13:13,7 --> 0:13:13,33
flashing?


309
0:13:13,33 --> 0:13:14,9
-You got it.


310
0:13:14,9 --> 0:13:14,48
CHRIS HARRIS: OK.


311
0:13:14,48 --> 0:13:15,16
-And it's pretty.


312
0:13:15,16 --> 0:13:16,11
And it's the right size.


313
0:13:16,11 --> 0:13:18,12
CHRIS HARRIS: It's utterly
beautiful.


314
0:13:18,12 --> 0:13:20,63
And how much is one of those?


315
0:13:20,63 --> 0:13:23,22
-Probably $400 or $500.


316
0:13:23,22 --> 0:13:25,33
CHRIS HARRIS: Do you need the
fuel filler cap that big?


317
0:13:25,33 --> 0:13:26,58
-Yes.


318
0:13:26,58 --> 0:13:28,9



319
0:13:28,9 --> 0:13:29,76
No, no, no, no.


320
0:13:29,76 --> 0:13:32,67
A lot of what we do is governed
by how it looks.


321
0:13:32,67 --> 0:13:36,4
But underneath there it's
fully functional.


322
0:13:36,4 --> 0:13:38,58
CHRIS HARRIS: That's
just beautiful.


323
0:13:38,58 --> 0:13:42,6
So, top mounts, Ohlins?


324
0:13:42,6 --> 0:13:45,56
-The top mounts, these are kind
of a prototype piece.


325
0:13:45,56 --> 0:13:47,47
There's a company on the
East Coast that are


326
0:13:47,47 --> 0:13:47,9
building them with them.


327
0:13:47,9 --> 0:13:49,33
They're sealed.


328
0:13:49,33 --> 0:13:51,84
So again, what we did was we
went to a lot of race car


329
0:13:51,84 --> 0:13:55,88
guys, the sort of best in
class race car parts.


330
0:13:55,88 --> 0:13:58,36
But they don't make street car
stuff, so we have to ask them


331
0:13:58,36 --> 0:14:1,51
to adjust what they're doing for
what we do, which is build


332
0:14:1,51 --> 0:14:3,11
a road car.


333
0:14:3,11 --> 0:14:7,78
People think they want a bunch
of motorsport bits on, but


334
0:14:7,78 --> 0:14:10,1
once you go down the road and
things are clanking and


335
0:14:10,1 --> 0:14:15,66
clacking, it gets old
very, very quick.


336
0:14:15,66 --> 0:14:16,75
CHRIS HARRIS: I've been
there, done that.


337
0:14:16,75 --> 0:14:21,29
Now, 17-inch rims give you the
chance to have big brakes.


338
0:14:21,29 --> 0:14:23,96
So this is the classic 993
Turbo brake setup, is it?


339
0:14:23,96 --> 0:14:24,8
-You've got it.


340
0:14:24,8 --> 0:14:27,94
The idea was that it
would bolt up, no


341
0:14:27,94 --> 0:14:29,285
problem, kind of no BS.


342
0:14:29,285 --> 0:14:30,44
It would just work.


343
0:14:30,44 --> 0:14:34,8
And we took a look at--


344
0:14:34,8 --> 0:14:36,69
we worked with Brembo for a
bit to look at an actual


345
0:14:36,69 --> 0:14:38,29
motorsport caliper and rotor.


346
0:14:38,29 --> 0:14:41,49
And it was just sort of exactly
what we were trying to


347
0:14:41,49 --> 0:14:43,71
avoid was a car that just
wouldn't work well, or


348
0:14:43,71 --> 0:14:47,72
wouldn't feel right or have
some compromise to it.


349
0:14:47,72 --> 0:14:49,53
What was nice is Porsche
did a lot of the work.


350
0:14:49,53 --> 0:14:52,25
And we tried to take the best
stuff that they did and stick


351
0:14:52,25 --> 0:14:52,49
it on here.


352
0:14:52,49 --> 0:14:53,62
We knew it would work.


353
0:14:53,62 --> 0:14:55,83
We knew it would fit.


354
0:14:55,83 --> 0:14:59,21
It's pretty easy to
ruin a great car.


355
0:14:59,21 --> 0:15:2,49
We had to leave the OEM world
for things like modern


356
0:15:2,49 --> 0:15:4,85
damping, though, which is--


357
0:15:4,85 --> 0:15:5,495
CHRIS HARRIS: Been
down that route.


358
0:15:5,495 --> 0:15:9,74
That's a beautiful looking
Ohlins three-way, which is


359
0:15:9,74 --> 0:15:10,42
just stunning.


360
0:15:10,42 --> 0:15:16,22
But outside of that, there's so
much bespoke bracketing and


361
0:15:16,22 --> 0:15:18,34
bits and bobs to hold
new body panels on.


362
0:15:18,34 --> 0:15:19,364
It's all completely different.


363
0:15:19,364 --> 0:15:19,776
-Yeah.


364
0:15:19,776 --> 0:15:21,43
These are all ours.


365
0:15:21,43 --> 0:15:23,63
We either make them here
or we have them made.


366
0:15:23,63 --> 0:15:24,69
And everything's new.


367
0:15:24,69 --> 0:15:26,32
There's nothing re-used.


368
0:15:26,32 --> 0:15:27,4
There's nothing old.


369
0:15:27,4 --> 0:15:32,66
And, of course, there's a
lot of electrical stuff.


370
0:15:32,66 --> 0:15:33,975
Everything matters, every bit.


371
0:15:33,975 --> 0:15:36,82



372
0:15:36,82 --> 0:15:38,36
This is for a turn signal.


373
0:15:38,36 --> 0:15:40,9
CHRIS HARRIS: It's absolute,
high quality, motorsport


374
0:15:40,9 --> 0:15:41,84
connector, isn't it?


375
0:15:41,84 --> 0:15:42,65
-It's as good as it gets.


376
0:15:42,65 --> 0:15:45,11
CHRIS HARRIS: Cabin.


377
0:15:45,11 --> 0:15:48,81
So what we haven't said is that
this is based on a 964.


378
0:15:48,81 --> 0:15:50,9
That's quite well known.


379
0:15:50,9 --> 0:15:52,91
But, again, completely new.


380
0:15:52,91 --> 0:15:54,65
I mean it's a re-dipped
shell, isn't it?


381
0:15:54,65 --> 0:15:57,61
Everything's been completely
made to look new.


382
0:15:57,61 --> 0:16:1,49
-The shell's been taken down to
metal and then given this


383
0:16:1,49 --> 0:16:5,3
E-coat, which is an
anti-corrosion coat, before


384
0:16:5,3 --> 0:16:8,41
the carbon panels are
bonded to the car.


385
0:16:8,41 --> 0:16:11,53
We adjust the dash.


386
0:16:11,53 --> 0:16:15,33
There's no air bag, but we
filled a bunch of holes and


387
0:16:15,33 --> 0:16:16,66
made a few adjustments
here and there.


388
0:16:16,66 --> 0:16:21,352
This, of course, accepts that
big milled aluminum dash panel


389
0:16:21,352 --> 0:16:24,0
that attaches in
front of here.


390
0:16:24,0 --> 0:16:29,235
And, if you noticed, we could
get a new one of these old OEM


391
0:16:29,235 --> 0:16:32,71
220's and stick it
behind the dash.


392
0:16:32,71 --> 0:16:36,286
And we've adjusted the
way the buttons work.


393
0:16:36,286 --> 0:16:41,436
This is the OEM HVAC unit, but
it's been refaced and painted.


394
0:16:41,436 --> 0:16:44,62
We tried to make it look a
little old school without


395
0:16:44,62 --> 0:16:48,37
losing any functionality, which
is always a balance.


396
0:16:48,37 --> 0:16:51,1
And certainly, electronically,
everything has to


397
0:16:51,1 --> 0:16:52,24
be replaced in here.


398
0:16:52,24 --> 0:16:56,74
This is a bespoke harness,
front to rear.


399
0:16:56,74 --> 0:16:58,64
CHRIS HARRIS: How much does
the harness cost?


400
0:16:58,64 --> 0:17:3,18
-A mere $30,000.


401
0:17:3,18 --> 0:17:4,822
CHRIS HARRIS: This carpet
is actually--


402
0:17:4,822 --> 0:17:7,1
this is 356 carpet, isn't it?


403
0:17:7,1 --> 0:17:8,31
It just looks perfect.


404
0:17:8,31 --> 0:17:10,77
Coarse, hard wearing,
but again,


405
0:17:10,77 --> 0:17:12,109
somehow feels luxurious.


406
0:17:12,109 --> 0:17:13,68
I don't know how you make some
thing that looks like it's got


407
0:17:13,68 --> 0:17:15,3
Labrador hair sticking
out of it feel


408
0:17:15,3 --> 0:17:17,74
luxurious, but it does.


409
0:17:17,74 --> 0:17:20,339
-Underneath the carpet is
the sound deadening.


410
0:17:20,339 --> 0:17:24,69
We hired a gentleman who spends
his time quieting


411
0:17:24,69 --> 0:17:25,2
private planes.


412
0:17:25,2 --> 0:17:28,6
So he deals with problems that
no car manufacturer has ever


413
0:17:28,6 --> 0:17:32,4
approached in terms of
sound and weight.


414
0:17:32,4 --> 0:17:34,68
So it's covered in
multiple layers.


415
0:17:34,68 --> 0:17:37,37
It doesn't look very scientific,
but it's actually


416
0:17:37,37 --> 0:17:39,85
how they do it in planes.


417
0:17:39,85 --> 0:17:42,74
There's a strategy in
the layering and


418
0:17:42,74 --> 0:17:44,43
the types of materials.


419
0:17:44,43 --> 0:17:48,6
And he spent a lot of time in
the car with microphones and


420
0:17:48,6 --> 0:17:51,47
another kinds of measurement
machines, and this is the


421
0:17:51,47 --> 0:17:55,0
package we have right now.


422
0:17:55,0 --> 0:17:59,25
CHRIS HARRIS: Engine
bay, come on.


423
0:17:59,25 --> 0:18:0,75
Business end.


424
0:18:0,75 --> 0:18:2,1
Motor by Cosworth?


425
0:18:2,1 --> 0:18:3,16
-Yep.


426
0:18:3,16 --> 0:18:4,21
CHRIS HARRIS: How many liters?


427
0:18:4,21 --> 0:18:5,26
-3.8.


428
0:18:5,26 --> 0:18:7,23
CHRIS HARRIS: And we're
saying 350 horsepower,


429
0:18:7,23 --> 0:18:9,42
but I drove it yesterday.


430
0:18:9,42 --> 0:18:11,56
Feels like it might have a bit
more than that to me, unless


431
0:18:11,56 --> 0:18:15,39
they're lying about the weight
at 1,200 kilograms.


432
0:18:15,39 --> 0:18:15,89
Wow.


433
0:18:15,89 --> 0:18:18,27
A thing of beauty, again.


434
0:18:18,27 --> 0:18:20,72
GT3 crank in this one?


435
0:18:20,72 --> 0:18:24,65
-GT3 crank, individual throttle
bodies, coil on plug,


436
0:18:24,65 --> 0:18:28,36
so there's a gaping hole where
distributors would be.


437
0:18:28,36 --> 0:18:29,3
CHRIS HARRIS: Piston
and rod to your


438
0:18:29,3 --> 0:18:31,11
design, or just the piston?


439
0:18:31,11 --> 0:18:36,32
-Cosworth specified all the
outsourced stuff, so they had


440
0:18:36,32 --> 0:18:39,38
Carrillo make us a rod, a very
special, lightweight rod


441
0:18:39,38 --> 0:18:41,53
that's still going
to work for--


442
0:18:41,53 --> 0:18:43,84
it's still going to be
a 100,000-mile motor.


443
0:18:43,84 --> 0:18:45,57
And a piston--


444
0:18:45,57 --> 0:18:48,42
they really spec'd
the whole thing.


445
0:18:48,42 --> 0:18:53,33
We hand them a case, a few other
bits and bobs, and some


446
0:18:53,33 --> 0:18:56,69
heads, and everything else comes
in from other suppliers.


447
0:18:56,69 --> 0:19:0,83
And then they tolerance them,
and put it together, and stick


448
0:19:0,83 --> 0:19:4,55
it on the dyno for a day,
and ship it over here.


449
0:19:4,55 --> 0:19:6,8
CHRIS HARRIS: Now what I suspect
we can't see on this


450
0:19:6,8 --> 0:19:10,37
car is one of the most important
in the whole story.


451
0:19:10,37 --> 0:19:14,355
You're switching to this new
bespoke panel widths and panel


452
0:19:14,355 --> 0:19:15,89
shapes for the front
of your fenders.


453
0:19:15,89 --> 0:19:16,84
And they're made from carbon.


454
0:19:16,84 --> 0:19:17,47
-Yep.


455
0:19:17,47 --> 0:19:19,737
CHRIS HARRIS: So can you show us
where the carbon begins and


456
0:19:19,737 --> 0:19:20,84
where it ends?


457
0:19:20,84 --> 0:19:22,73
-Well, this car has
a carbon roof.


458
0:19:22,73 --> 0:19:28,2
So effectively, the stock window
frame is still here,


459
0:19:28,2 --> 0:19:30,63
but we've cut out very close
to the lines there.


460
0:19:30,63 --> 0:19:33,5
It has a carbon roof bonded on
that comes down to about here.


461
0:19:33,5 --> 0:19:36,98
Then the panel, which is a
little tough to see, but


462
0:19:36,98 --> 0:19:40,88
everything on this side of the
chassis-- so the outside the


463
0:19:40,88 --> 0:19:44,4
window frame-- is completely
composite, starting here, all


464
0:19:44,4 --> 0:19:48,11
the way down and through
the front of the car.


465
0:19:48,11 --> 0:19:52,72
So before this is put on, it's
just an odd kind of skeleton


466
0:19:52,72 --> 0:19:56,205
of the inside of the window,
which is metal.


467
0:19:56,205 --> 0:20:1,516
So from here forward, of course,
the hood, the bumper.


468
0:20:1,516 --> 0:20:3,15
We've got steel up here.


469
0:20:3,15 --> 0:20:4,75
Of course, this doesn't
change.


470
0:20:4,75 --> 0:20:5,48
CHRIS HARRIS: Yeah.


471
0:20:5,48 --> 0:20:6,77
-But yeah.


472
0:20:6,77 --> 0:20:10,98
And it's tremendously strong
and its tremendously light.


473
0:20:10,98 --> 0:20:12,63
CHRIS HARRIS: And the molds,
obviously all yours.


474
0:20:12,63 --> 0:20:14,36
-Yeah.


475
0:20:14,36 --> 0:20:16,36
CHRIS HARRIS: As you've probably
now realized, the


476
0:20:16,36 --> 0:20:18,95
lengths they've gone to to get
to the stage where it's all


477
0:20:18,95 --> 0:20:21,21
repeatable, that's the
impressive thing.


478
0:20:21,21 --> 0:20:22,755
You've reached the stage
now where you can see.


479
0:20:22,755 --> 0:20:25,1
Look at the quality
of this product.


480
0:20:25,1 --> 0:20:26,16
And it's all repeatable.


481
0:20:26,16 --> 0:20:28,15
It's just that you've got to
write the check to buy all the


482
0:20:28,15 --> 0:20:30,3
expensive bits.


483
0:20:30,3 --> 0:20:32,97
-And we went through several
stages of tooling.


484
0:20:32,97 --> 0:20:35,69
It didn't happen
the first time.


485
0:20:35,69 --> 0:20:40,68
We really had to try,
and try, and try.


486
0:20:40,68 --> 0:20:43,595
As much as you try to engineer
it, it doesn't matter until


487
0:20:43,595 --> 0:20:46,9
you stick it on the car
and make sure it fits.


488
0:20:46,9 --> 0:20:49,59
Then you have go back
and retool, readjust


489
0:20:49,59 --> 0:20:50,74
until you get it right.


490
0:20:50,74 --> 0:20:52,11
Now it's right.


491
0:20:52,11 --> 0:20:55,4
CHRIS HARRIS: How many
thousand dollars?


492
0:20:55,4 --> 0:20:56,67
-Depends on the spec.


493
0:20:56,67 --> 0:21:0,77
As low as high threes,
mid- to high three's,


494
0:21:0,77 --> 0:21:1,86
but as high as 500.


495
0:21:1,86 --> 0:21:3,12
It depends on--


496
0:21:3,12 --> 0:21:6,43
CHRIS HARRIS: As low
as high $300,000?


497
0:21:6,43 --> 0:21:7,3
-Yeah, it's--


498
0:21:7,3 --> 0:21:8,17
CHRIS HARRIS: You do understand
the dictionary


499
0:21:8,17 --> 0:21:9,63
definition of the word
low, don't you?


500
0:21:9,63 --> 0:21:13,17



501
0:21:13,17 --> 0:21:13,94
Just beautiful.


502
0:21:13,94 --> 0:21:15,19
Just beautiful.


503
0:21:15,19 --> 0:21:18,14



504
0:21:18,14 --> 0:21:21,11
And now, you probably think it
would be a crime to take this


505
0:21:21,11 --> 0:21:24,745
piece of four-wheeled OCD
onto a racetrack.


506
0:21:24,745 --> 0:21:28,25
But that's not a notion I've
ever felt any sympathy for so,


507
0:21:28,25 --> 0:21:30,302
this is the track bit now.


508
0:21:30,302 --> 0:21:32,1
But here's the thing.


509
0:21:32,1 --> 0:21:35,54
It's not actually very easy
to jump into a Singer


510
0:21:35,54 --> 0:21:37,0
and just drive it.


511
0:21:37,0 --> 0:21:39,55
Not because the car's
obstructive but because you're


512
0:21:39,55 --> 0:21:43,71
constantly distracted by the
details, the sheer beauty of


513
0:21:43,71 --> 0:21:47,16
the shapes, the dish of the

really.

undiluted want.

[CAR ENGINE]


519
0:22:2,15 --> 0:22:5,86
CHRIS HARRIS: Of course, the
Singer 911 is not designed to


520
0:22:5,86 --> 0:22:8,38
be a track car, but the guys
wanted to have some track


521
0:22:8,38 --> 0:22:9,266
performance.


522
0:22:9,266 --> 0:22:10,99
And It's got just that.


523

0:22:17,676 --> 0:22:20,84
Well, to me, it feels every bit
as strong as that, maybe


526
0:22:20,84 --> 0:22:21,37
even stronger.


527
0:22:21,37 --> 0:22:23,972
The car weighs 1,200 kilograms,
but it hasn't had


528
0:22:23,972 --> 0:22:28,4
much development, even though
it's got these three-way


529
0:22:28,4 --> 0:22:29,23
adjustable Ohlins dampers.


530
0:22:29,23 --> 0:22:31,55

a very sharp car.

a classic 911.

If you back off, it
wants to rotate.

your footing.

the beauty.

more special cars that I'll


543

0:25:19,216 --> 0:25:21,32
CHRIS HARRIS: Fantastic
motor car.


583
0:25:21,32 --> 0:25:26,43



584
0:25:26,43 --> 0:25:28,0
Oh, yes.


585
0:25:28,0 --> 0:25:31,26
The Singer shouldn't have, and
doesn't need, great track


586
0:25:31,26 --> 0:25:35,97
performance, but out of the box,
it's not far away from


587
0:25:35,97 --> 0:25:37,777
having it already.


588
0:25:37,777 --> 0:25:39,184
It's a special thing.


589
0:25:39,184 --> 0:25:43,88



590
0:25:43,88 --> 0:25:47,19
Could you really spend half
a million dollars on a


591
0:25:47,19 --> 0:25:49,69
reimagined 911?


592
0:25:49,69 --> 0:25:52,55
If I had the folding, you
know what, I could.


593
0:25:52,55 --> 0:25:56,7
In many ways, this is my perfect
car-- small, fast


594
0:25:56,7 --> 0:26:0,64
enough, challenging, exciting,
beautiful, and altered in a


595
0:26:0,64 --> 0:26:4,57
way that concentrates the bits
of old 911's that I love, and


596
0:26:4,57 --> 0:26:8,32
yet updates the bits that
I would happily discard.


597
0:26:8,32 --> 0:26:11,91
What more can I say than,
what a spectacular


598
0:26:11,91 --> 0:26:15,33
way to start 2013.


599
0:26:15,33 --> 0:28:15,33
