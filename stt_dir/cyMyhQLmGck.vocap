###26 LEO PARENTE: Guys, I need your help to come up with the
###29 content for a new show.
###30 Here's how I envision this next show.
###32 IAN WHELAN: OK.
###32 LEO PARENTE: With all the politics going on in racing,
###34 all the personal agendas, I want to start the next
###37 "SHAKEDOWN" with this subject.
###39 DRIVE "SHAKEDOWN" is going to design the ideal North
###42 American racing, the collection of races and race
###45 cars that will grow racing, reduce the clutter, motivate
###49 the influx of money, media, and fans.
###52 So I need your guys' help to figure out how
###55 we fill that up.
###56 
###60 What racing-- was is the ideal that we want?
###62 MAX SEEGER: Yeah.
###62 IAN WHELAN: Yeah.
###63 LEO PARENTE: You've been through "SHAKEDOWN." Thank you
###65 for joining the team.
###66 MAX SEEGER: Oh, my pleasure.
###67 LEO PARENTE: But we've done stuff--
###68 the Michael Johnson thing.
###69 MAX SEEGER: Yes.
###69 LEO PARENTE: Race of Champions.
###70 MAX SEEGER: That's right.
###71 IAN WHELAN: Right.
###71 LEO PARENTE: And you seem to have this passion for racing
###73 outside of F1.
###75 IAN WHELAN: Well, I'm mostly an F1 fan, but I can
###77 appreciate other racing.
###79 And I think that there are certain things that I like
###84 about F1 that maybe we could apply to other racing or maybe
###86 things from that past of F1 that we could apply to other
###90 racing, because I don't necessarily think F1's at its
###92 peak right now.
###93 LEO PARENTE: So I want to pretend this is like Hot Tub
###95 Time Machine," where it's all new.
###98 It's all fresh.
###99 We can start over.
###100 And I know there are some rules of reality, but we're
###105 going to wipe it clean.
###105 MAX SEEGER: OK.
###106 LEO PARENTE: And I want to focus on North America only.
###107 Let's not try to chomp off the world right now.
###109 IAN WHELAN: OK.
###110 LEO PARENTE: And without getting too much into the
###111 criteria, I think we should talk a little bit about what
###115 we think racing needs to accomplish to be more popular,
###118 and then cut through the elements of the action or the
###121 cars or the venues or the media or whatever.
###123 MAX SEEGER: Yeah.
###124 LEO PARENTE: Let me start with just that.
###126 What do you want racing to be to be better?
###128 IAN WHELAN: Well, I think racing needs to be a little
###132 bit less opaque.
###134 Right now, I see cars running around tracks that I can't
###139 tell how they relate to any real cars on the road.
###142 And I'm saying that as an F1 fan.
###144 I actually love the crazy technology of F1.
###147 But I think aside from that racing, there needs to be--
###151 the lower tiers or the sports car racing, I need to be able
###154 to relate those cars to things on the road.
###158 LEO PARENTE: Why?
###158 IAN WHELAN: Why?
###159 Because I think if you're a fan of Porsches or you're a
###162 fan of Fords--
###164 
###166 you're a fan of something, you want to root for
###170 that kind of thing.
###171 You want to have an allegiance.
###174 LEO PARENTE: OK.
###175 And I think racing is in that interesting spot where no one
###179 cares, really, about the soccer ball, or who made the
###181 baseball bat, or how it's constructed.
###184 They watch the sport.
###185 But because the tool is so integral to racing, I guess it
###189 does matter.
###190 Max, you're looking at me.
###191 I know you've got something.
###192 MAX SEEGER: Yeah, yeah.
###192 Well, no, because the thing is, for me, I understand that
###197 there are a lot of subtle things happening on the track.
###201 And I appreciate it, totally.
###204 But--
###205 LEO PARENTE: Don't pander to me.
###206 MAX SEEGER: OK, no, no.
###207 But I don't know if it's enough for me.
###212 So there are a lot of things that I'm into where you have
###216 an appreciation of it.
###217 You get really into it.
###218 So I don't see-- unless someone gets really into or
###221 understands How important it is to get the tires up to
###227 temp, because there's no such thing as doing a lap at speed
###231 if the tires aren't up to temp.
###234 LEO PARENTE: Fuck Adrian Newey.
###234 MAX SEEGER: Oh, my pleasure.
###237 So for me, I think that getting an appreciation for
###240 that sort of stuff, maybe there's a shortcut, maybe
###243 there's not.
###244 LEO PARENTE: So this came up once before.
###246 For you--
###247 and there is no wrong answer here.
###248 For you, watching a race car go fast, it's not enough.
###253 I could watch an R18, e-tron-- whatever the
###255 hell they call it--
###256 around Sebring, and I could catch the nuances and be
###258 entertained.
###259 But at the end of the day, maybe you're just watching
###262 highway traffic.
###263 MAX SEEGER: Right.
###263 LEO PARENTE: So there needs to be more?
###264 MAX SEEGER: Yeah.
###265 I don't want to put it down.
###267 I'm not putting it down in that--
###268 LEO PARENTE: There are no disclaimers here.
###269 MAX SEEGER: OK.
###270 Well, and also, just going fast isn't really enough,
###272 because when I was in Bangkok for Race of Champions--
###277 LEO PARENTE: Hanging with Vettel.
###277 MAX SEEGER: Yes.
###278 LEO PARENTE: Yeah, I heard that.
###278 MAX SEEGER: That's where we met each other, hung out.
###282 I actually didn't talk to him at all, so I want to clear
###284 that up right away.
###286 LEO PARENTE: You blew in his ear.
###287 MAX SEEGER: Yeah.
###287 LEO PARENTE: Webber's a wanker.
###288 MAX SEEGER: Yes.
###288 LEO PARENTE: Yeah, OK.
###289 MAX SEEGER: That name doesn't really mean anything to me.
###292 [LAUGHTER]
###293 MAX SEEGER: So a guy goes out, gets some air
###300 on that first lift.
###302 LEO PARENTE: Oh, it was that race?
###303 MAX SEEGER: Yes.
###303 LEO PARENTE: The Race of Champions, the bridge, the
###304 whole thing.
###304 MAX SEEGER: Yeah.
###305 They're setting up.
###306 And I'm rolling.
###306 I get it, because I'm a professional, OK?
###309 
###312 But then they put a chicane in there.
###314 LEO PARENTE: Yeah, because it was dangerous, I guess.
###315 MAX SEEGER: Yeah.
###315 And then it sort of got less exciting for me.
###318 Not that I wanted someone to get
###319 hurt, but air is important.
###322 LEO PARENTE: Wait a minute.
###322 Let me write that down.
###323 So they took away the thing that was interesting you.
###326 And then it was time to go home.
###328 MAX SEEGER: Yeah.
###328 Well, then I had to stay there up until midnight--
###331 IAN WHELAN: Keep shooting.
###331 MAX SEEGER: Yeah, And keep shooting against my will.
###334 LEO PARENTE: OK.
###335 So actually, I'm going to use that as a little bit of a
###337 segue then.
###338 So let's start defining the action.
###340 Jordan Taylor went on about to him, racing is passing.
###346 And I just negated watching a car go fast.
###348 At some point in time, is it enough?
###350 IAN WHELAN: Yeah.
###350 LEO PARENTE: And you were talking about jumps.
###352 MAX SEEGER: Right.
###353 LEO PARENTE: God knows what video game
###354 he's got in his mind.
###355 So let's define action.
###357 What do you want to see as action in racing?
###359 MAX SEEGER: I think that I just want to
###361 see pushing the envelope.
###364 And maybe to me, that looks like one wheel's off the
###366 ground or something like that, because I don't know if I can
###370 really gauge how fast something's going.
###372 IAN WHELAN: Yeah, or how on the edge they are.
###375 MAX SEEGER: Yeah.
###375 IAN WHELAN: If they look like they're not really on the edge
###377 from the outside.
###377 MAX SEEGER: Yeah.
###377 Maybe it's as simple as facial expressions of a camera right
###383 at their face, because we're used to seeing straight out.
###385 But maybe we need to see some gnarly faces.
###388 IAN WHELAN: That's a good idea, yeah.
###389 LEO PARENTE: Well, you know, the old guys used to talk
###391 about how, F1, you could watch Nuvolari and whoever actually
###396 steer the car.
###397 IAN WHELAN: Right.
###397 LEO PARENTE: And you could see their movement.
###398 You could see them working the car.
###399 I like MotoGP because you can see the rider working.
###402 IAN WHELAN: Right.
###402 MAX SEEGER: Yeah.
###402 LEO PARENTE: Now, Tony Kanaan's a little tired
###405 because his head is tilted to the left.
###407 And David Hobbes goes friggin' ballistic when the car goes
###411 one degree off angle, because that's an F1 slide--
###414 Kimi excepted.
###415 Are you on that page?
###416 We need to see more of it?
###418 IAN WHELAN: Yeah.
###418 I watch F1 all the time, but I can't even pick out some of
###421 things they're talking about when they're--
###423 LEO PARENTE: They're just making [BLEEP]
###424 up.
###425 IAN WHELAN: They might be, yeah.
###426 Sometimes, it's like they're talking about things that are
###429 going on there with-- like you said,
###432 they're off a few degrees.
###433 I can't even tell on TV.
###435 But to them, it's a big deal.
###438 So I feel like we need a little bit of a closer
###440 connection to what's really going on in these cars.
###445 LEO PARENTE: So that makes me think of something else that
###447 we should probably cover up front as a
###449 little bit of a criteria.
###451 So you guys think I'm deep into the bubble.
###453 You're a fan, knowledgeable.
###456 MAX SEEGER: I'm around it.
###457 LEO PARENTE: I'm going to be polite, but you're around it.
###460 You're more of an outsider looking in.
###461 MAX SEEGER: Yeah.
###462 
###464 LEO PARENTE: The nuances work for the die hard.
###468 But who should we be looking at?
###470 Are we looking at a bigger audience?
###472 Or are we looking to make a generalist more of a disciple?
###475 You know what I'm trying to say?
###476 MAX SEEGER: Yeah.
###476 IAN WHELAN: I think we need to have a little bit of both.
###480 Racing needs to expand, probably for business reasons.
###485 And there's a lot of people who are casual fans that maybe
###488 if they could learn a little bit about the sport or find a
###492 way to become more engaged, they could become a
###497 higher-level fan somehow.
###499 LEO PARENTE: What do you think?
###501 MAX SEEGER: Maybe I'll tell this quick story of--
###505 I overheard--
###507 so I skateboard.
###509 LEO PARENTE: Wow.
###509 Really?
###510 MAX SEEGER: Yeah.
###510 Come see if we're--
###511 LEO PARENTE: And that's in addition to the band you have.
###511 What's the band?
###512 The Price of Bandages?
###513 MAX SEEGER: No.
###514 The what?
###515 LEO PARENTE: I don't know.
###516 MAX SEEGER: The Mayor of Bad News.
###517 LEO PARENTE: I was close.
###518 MAX SEEGER: Yeah.
###518 LEO PARENTE: Yeah, OK.
###518 Go ahead.
###519 MAX SEEGER: So this kid's skateboarding.
###520 There is a game called SKATE.
###522 It's like HORSE for basketball.
###525 So one person does a trick.
###526 The other person does a trick to match it.
###528 LEO PARENTE: By the way, I'm old, not dead.
###529 Keep going.
###530 MAX SEEGER: OK.
###530 All right, fair enough.
###532 So there's your, I guess, dominant stance.
###536 Maybe it's right foot forward.
###538 But you can also do things with the other way, and that's
###540 called switch.
###541 It's like rediscovering skateboarding.
###544 So the one kid goes to the other kid, hey, you don't do
###547 any switch tricks.
###549 And then that kid goes, switch tricks
###551 don't impress my parents.
###553 Because to them, it looks like the same thing.
###556 So I feel like maybe that's why I want to
###559 see more air stuff.
###562 LEO PARENTE: So have you watched Global Rally Cross?
###565 MAX SEEGER: Accidentally.
###567 [LAUGHTER]
###568 LEO PARENTE: Do you like that stuff?
###570 MAX SEEGER: I guess so.
###572 I do like those--
###575 the Gymkhana video in San Francisco.
###579 IAN WHELAN: Right.
###579 That feels like you're on the edge a little bit, right?
###581 MAX SEEGER: Right.
###582 That feels--
###583 IAN WHELAN: What if there was a race on that course that Ken
###587 Block drove through San Francisco?
###589 Wouldn't that be cool?
###590 MAX SEEGER: Yeah.
###591 That would almost--
###592 maybe race tracks are too sterile.
###596 LEO PARENTE: Funny.
###597 And I missed it.
###597 That's my disclaimer.
###598 But at this last X Game, they had a new
###601 event called Gymkhana.
###603 And they basically did what you just described.
###606 And I guess it was like drifting is, plus I guess
###609 there was a combination of speed or racing measurement as
###612 well as gymnastic type judging, did they do the trick
###616 or whatever.
###618 So again, if it is exciting and interesting, am I drifting
###623 toward it for the kids?
###625 MAX SEEGER: Well, that's--
###625 see, I don't want to ruin racing for--
###629 LEO PARENTE: Yeah, but this is the point.
###631 There's no definition of ruining racing, because I feel
###634 like the traditionalists are clinging
###636 to traditional things.
###639 Indy Car, for example, thinks it's an epiphany that instead
###642 of having practice, qualifying, and the race on
###644 Sunday, they're going to have two races Saturday and Sunday.
###647 MAX SEEGER: Yeah.
###647 LEO PARENTE: La-dee-freaking-dah, OK?
###649 That's not a big epiphany.
###651 But if that works to attract more people because they
###653 actually watch racing versus cars going round, so be it.
###656 So you're not ruining racing.
###658 We're kind of argument that racing is a little bit broke
###662 and maybe getting more broke as no new people come to the
###667 sport because they've got options.
###669 MAX SEEGER: Yeah.
###670 IAN WHELAN: And we're also talking about different--
###671 we're talking about a whole sanctioning body with
###673 different types of racing under it.
###674 So maybe certain types of racing
###676 appeal to younger people.
###677 And then it feeds them up along the
###679 way as they get older.
###680 Maybe they kind of graduate to the more technical stuff that
###685 is not maybe as wild looking, but there are other nuances
###688 that they'll pick up as they grow.
###689 LEO PARENTE: Well, that's where I was getting to.
###691 And I'm going in my notes.
###692 So under some of the objectives I scribble out, in
###696 no particular order, one, the cars are the stars.
###698 I think what the cars are attract people to watch this
###702 and are probably going to be leading why we need more than
###704 one just racing series in this collection.
###708 IAN WHELAN: And that goes back to what I was saying at the
###710 beginning about relating to the cars.
###713 I always know there's a place for the spaceship cars.
###715 I love them.
###716 But I feel like even when we have cars that look like real
###720 cars, you still can't connect to them as well.
###722 LEO PARENTE: Yeah.
###724 And the corollary to that is somewhere along the line, the
###726 drivers have to matter.
###728 Action is key.
###729 We already talked about that.
###730 I think we've got to address technology, because somewhere
###732 between dumbing it down and spec cars and all this stuff--
###736 NASCAR--
###737 versus people loving the technology and making it
###740 relevant, at the end of the day, we're having the
###742 discussion about what the fans want, the venues, where this
###746 is, how it's set up.
###748 Everyone loves traditional road courses, but something
###751 new and different may be a better way to go.
###754 IAN WHELAN: Yeah.
###754 Like we were talking about, a street course on some
###757 crazy-looking terrain in San Francisco.
###761 That looks so cool in a lot of different types of racing.
###764 I know it's difficult to do, but--
###765 LEO PARENTE: Well, and that's the part where we're not
###767 getting way too ahead of our ourselves.
###769 Is it real or is it virtual?
###771 There will never be a New York Grand Prix.
###772 But virtually, I can get on the sim and I can run around
###776 Columbus Circle in a race car.
###777 IAN WHELAN: Yeah.
###778 MAX SEEGER: Yeah.
###779 LEO PARENTE: And then somewhere along the line,
###780 media has to factor in.
###782 MAX SEEGER: Right.
###782 LEO PARENTE: I love banging on the TV guys, but-- or even
###785 doing internet, but maybe.
###786 IAN WHELAN: Well, the media thing connects with the
###790 drivers as stars aspect.
###792 To me, those two things are related because I think that,
###796 especially in this country, the media coverage of these
###800 people who are driving these cars is kind of lacking.
###803 I've watch some of the Sky Sports coverage in the BBC,
###806 and they do a much better job of letting you get to know
###810 these guys.
###811 And then you feel more of a connection to them.
###813 And I think that's important.
###815 When you watch football--
###816 I'm not even a football fan, but I know that people have
###820 their favorite players, and you're rooting for these guys.
###823 LEO PARENTE: So I would argue that the roadmap is out there.
###825 You can take an entity that may be complex and nuanced but
###829 make it play at a couple of levels.
###830 IAN WHELAN: Right.
###831 LEO PARENTE: You can make the personalities matter.
###832 You can break down what's really going on.
###834 And you can do things.
###835 As much as everyone hates PKs and all that stuff in soccer,
###839 you can break it down and make excitement, I guess, if you
###843 have to, as long as you manage it so it respects the game.
###847 IAN WHELAN: Yeah.
###848 LEO PARENTE: And actually, that leads to who's going to
###850 run this thing.
###851 And the simplest way that I'd throw it out is that you've
###855 got to follow the money.
###856 The tools are there.
###856 The manufacturers have the most money, the most vested
###860 interest, probably sponsors and probably media.
###863 So there should be this little Mafia
###866 collective of these people.
###867 They throw their money in, put the kitty in the game.
###870 That's the money to fund the type of media that needs to be
###873 done, the type of commitment that needs to be made, whether
###876 it's a kids' program or a junior program to bring young
###879 sperm into racing rather than Rich Dad 101.
###884 And then, they're the ones--
###886 frankly, as a benevolent dictatorship, they're the ones
###889 that start to make decisions.
###890 But we're playing that role.
###891 That's the role I want to play right now.
###893 IAN WHELAN: Yeah.
###893 LEO PARENTE: So if that sounded
###896 too serious, I apologize.
###898 But now, it kind of cuts to, so what racing
###900 series should we have?
###902 IAN WHELAN: Well, for sports cars, I want to see something
###906 like Can-Am again--
###908 LEO PARENTE: The old--
###908 IAN WHELAN: Yeah.
###910 MAX SEEGER: What is--
###910 LEO PARENTE: Which part?
###911 No rules?
###912 IAN WHELAN: Yeah.
###912 I like the--
###913 MAX SEEGER: What is that?
###914 IAN WHELAN: Can-Am was a series--
###915 what is it--
###916 up through the '80s.
###917 I know it started '60s.
###919 LEO PARENTE: Yeah.
###920 The good stuff was '70s.
###921 IAN WHELAN: And it was basically like an unrestricted
###923 racing series.
###923 These guys had--
###925 they could do anything they wanted, basically.
###927 Were there really any big rules?
###928 LEO PARENTE: There were minimal rules.
###930 It was an open formula with them.
###931 IAN WHELAN: And it was popular in America.
###934 A lot of European guys came over to race, and they built
###937 these cars that were just wild.
###939 They were just completely wild.
###941 LEO PARENTE: Chaparral put wings on it for the first
###943 time, aerodynamically.
###945 McLaren, to catch up with Porsche, for example, were
###949 running 8-liter, 9-liter motors.
###951 IAN WHELAN: Yeah.
###952 LEO PARENTE: Anything went.
###953 IAN WHELAN: Yeah.
###953 LEO PARENTE: If you could build it within the box,
###954 freaking let it go.
###956 IAN WHELAN: I think you could have something like that now.
###958 But maybe you just restrict the amount of engines they can
###961 use per season.
###962 Let them run 21,000 rpms.
###964 I don't care.
###965 Let them put turbos.
###966 Let them run 12 cylinders on the car.
###969 Anything goes.
###970 I want to see a mix of different things from the
###972 manufacturers who can profile--
###975 show off their own technology in their different ways and
###979 say I know how to do this better than
###980 you guys over there.
###981 LEO PARENTE: So to that point, do you think WEC with the P1
###985 cars are close to that, or F1?
###989 IAN WHELAN: Well, the P1 cars are cool to me, but there's
###993 still not enough of them.
###996 We need a whole field of those cars.
###998 LEO PARENTE: So the problem's going to be, not to be neg, is
###1000 safety and budget.
###1002 IAN WHELAN: Right.
###1003 LEO PARENTE: But that's where--
###1003 IAN WHELAN: What's safety?
###1005 LEO PARENTE: Well, to your point much earlier, I don't
###1008 think you can negate danger.
###1010 You've got to make this feel special.
###1011 If anyone thinks they can just jump in a car and act like
###1014 they can drive with a sim, then you've lost a
###1017 bigger part of this.
###1019 Slam any sports guy you want, including Mr. PED.
###1022 We know we can't do those things, so we watch because
###1025 they're gods.
###1026 MAX SEEGER: Sure.
###1026 LEO PARENTE: And from a race car standpoint, if it's too
###1029 easy to friggin' drive, besides the fact that it's
###1031 probably not appealing, the drivers will tell you, it's
###1034 too easy to frigging drive.
###1036 And there's no allure there.
###1037 MAX SEEGER: They'll say that now?
###1038 LEO PARENTE: Oh, yeah.
###1039 IAN WHELAN: Yeah.
###1039 The WEC cars--
###1040 I think they're really cool, but they look like they're
###1043 easy to drive.
###1044 And I don't know if they are, but--
###1046 LEO PARENTE: Yeah.
###1046 I'd have to ask Mich.
###1048 IAN WHELAN: I don't know.
###1049 From the outside, though--
###1051 it goes back to what we were talking about before.
###1052 If you look at these spaceships going down the road
###1055 at ridiculous speeds, it just seems completely undramatic.
###1060 Whereas something like Can-Am, everything looked like
###1063 anything could happen at any moment.
###1065 LEO PARENTE: So his definition of Can-Am, do you like that
###1068 idea of having something unlimited?
###1069 MAX SEEGER: Yeah, that sounds like-- because I think--
###1072 more than like seeing somebody get air or
###1075 something like that.
###1076 LEO PARENTE: Go ahead.
###1078 MAX SEEGER: Because I mean maybe that's a
###1079 little low com denom.
###1081 LEO PARENTE: WRC--
###1082 rally--
###1083 those cars fly.
###1084 MAX SEEGER: But I am that, because it spoke to me when
###1087 that guy got air at Race of Champions.
###1089 But I think creativity, to see people express themselves
###1096 within racing would be something that
###1098 would appeal to me.
###1099 IAN WHELAN: Well, that actually brings up something.
###1101 Like the old days of F1, when you had these constructors who
###1104 were building their own cars, that was amazing.
###1108 And there were so many different things these guys
###1110 were doing.
###1112 
###1113 The things I said about Can-Am--
###1115 I want to see similar rules in F1, like the old days where
###1119 you had four cylinder cars going up against V8s or V6s or
###1123 whatever, or V12s.
###1125 I know that probably with F1, if you had that first season,
###1129 you'd probably see the next season, everyone would just
###1131 figure out what happened, what was the best way and they'd
###1133 all go that way.
###1134 LEO PARENTE: But that happens anyway.
###1134 IAN WHELAN: Right.
###1135 LEO PARENTE: So actually, the creativity, like you were
###1137 talking about the F1, what my mind thought of was "Time
###1139 Attack."
###1140 IAN WHELAN: Right.
###1140 LEO PARENTE: All these kids love "Time Attack," because
###1143 they can be creative.
###1143 They can build their own car.
###1145 All the racing that I see, even the amateur stuff,
###1148 especially the pro, there's so many rules and regulations and
###1151 limitations.
###1152 And to your point, once someone comes up with a good
###1154 idea, they all need to follow that good idea, so everything
###1156 looks alike.
###1157 IAN WHELAN: Yeah.
###1158 LEO PARENTE: Here's what I was thinking.
###1160 North American racing only, we probably should have a number
###1163 of premier racing series to satisfy all these various
###1167 needs of action and whatever and technology and tradition.
###1170 And I'm going to throw this out, and then we can kind of
###1172 beat it to death.
###1173 Everything below that is either to learn the craft or
###1177 is a feeder series and really shouldn't distract from the
###1182 specialness of this.
###1183 So honestly, not all this [BLEEP]
###1185 should be on TV, because there's too much clutter.
###1187 So here's my short list.
###1188 I think there needs to be a premier open-wheel series in
###1191 North America, Indy Car evolved.
###1193 I would it would be very high tech, open spec, and be
###1198 technologically related to F1 so
###1201 there can be some crossover.
###1202 I'd even go so far as to suggest the Indy 500 should be
###1205 part of the F1 season.
###1206 IAN WHELAN: It's like the old days.
###1207 LEO PARENTE: Like the old days.
###1207 IAN WHELAN: And the old Indy cars actually were all
###1211 different and high tech for the time.
###1213 They looked cool.
###1214 LEO PARENTE: They had turbines.
###1215 IAN WHELAN: Yeah.
###1216 They had all kinds of crazy stuff.
###1217 And you had the F1 drivers coming over and driving cars
###1220 on a one-off basis.
###1221 Or, like you said, it was part of the whole world
###1225 championship.
###1226 LEO PARENTE: I'm not going to get caught in the details.
###1227 Somewhere along the line, there should be
###1228 a connect the dots.
###1230 But Indy Car should be the fastest cars in North America.
###1234 IAN WHELAN: Right.
###1235 Right now, I'm not interested at all, because
###1237 they're spec cars.
###1237 LEO PARENTE: The next one is, for me, there should be a
###1240 premier production car racing series.
###1243 And that's got to be NASCAR.
###1245 And I'm not sure it's all that broke, having NASCAR.
###1249 MAX SEEGER: OK.
###1250 LEO PARENTE: What do you think?
###1250 MAX SEEGER: I don't really have an opinion about NASCAR.
###1255 LEO PARENTE: OK.
###1257 MAX SEEGER: It's sort of just there.
###1258 LEO PARENTE: Yeah.
###1259 IAN WHELAN: Yeah.
###1259 MAX SEEGER: Right?
###1260 IAN WHELAN: I think they focus too much on the wrong things
###1262 in that series, but that's a whole other discussion.
###1266 MAX SEEGER: But maybe I could--
###1268 I didn't like broccoli at a certain point.
###1270 That's kids and all that.
###1271 LEO PARENTE: Got it.
###1272 I'm with you.
###1273 I got it.
###1273 IAN WHELAN: All right.
###1274 I don't know if there's anything that would really get
###1276 me too excited about NASCAR.
###1277 But I think at the very least, if the cars were
###1279 production-based like they used to be in NASCAR--
###1282 and if you don't have a rear-wheel drive V8 car in
###1286 your lineup, then you don't get to race in NASCAR.
###1290 You're going to fail.
###1291 And if you want to homologate cars like they used to do,
###1294 that would be cool, at least.
###1295 LEO PARENTE: Well, and then it makes cool, special edition
###1297 cars for sale to the public.
###1299 IAN WHELAN: I love--
###1299 exactly.
###1300 And that could go across all the boards,
###1302 except maybe F1 cars.
###1303 But I love the old days with homologation specials and all
###1306 this stuff with racing, because it gives people a real
###1309 connection with the race car.
###1311 LEO PARENTE: So my three were--
###1313 MAX SEEGER: Just before you do that, what is homologation?
###1314 LEO PARENTE: Oh, OK.
###1315 Sorry.
###1315 Go ahead.
###1315 IAN WHELAN: It's all right.
###1315 Homologation is when there's a requirement of, OK, you want
###1319 to race this car, this extra-fast,
###1322 bigger-displacement monster?
###1324 Well, then you have to build 500 or 5,000, whatever, street
###1329 cars that the public can actually buy to say, all
###1331 right, this is a real car that you make and you
###1333 want to race it.
###1334 LEO PARENTE: So the quick story is back in '70, '69, the
###1339 rules for Le Mans racing changed.
###1341 And the big engines were thrown out the door, and they
###1344 were going to have little 3-liter F1 engines.
###1346 But you could raise a 5-liter production car if you built--
###1350 I think the number was 250.
###1352 So Porsche literally built 200, 250 Porsche 917's, lined
###1357 them all up, had the sanctioning body
###1359 come and see the cars.
###1360 So Ferrari--
###1361 holy [BLEEP], Porsche has got a real
###1363 race car at five liters.
###1364 So Ferrari invited everyone over.
###1366 And the story is they built 100 of the cars, showed them
###1372 the 100 cars, set the other 100 over here--
###1374 let's go to lunch--
###1376 moved the 100 cars to another warehouse, and after lunch
###1379 showed them the 100.
###1380 And the guy said, oh, yeah.
###1380 200-- you got it.
###1382 OK, that's good.
###1382 MAX SEEGER: Wow.
###1383 LEO PARENTE: Homologation.
###1384 Anyway, I digress.
###1385 So more road racing for NASCAR, I mean, honestly, if
###1390 Australian V8 supercars have shown us anything--
###1392 IAN WHELAN: Right.
###1393 That's a perfect example of how NASCAR could succeed--
###1396 and WTCC, another example.
###1399 LEO PARENTE: And I bet you when I babble that in the
###1400 show, there'll be a ton of commentators saying, yeah,
###1402 yeah, yeah.
###1403 In my less redneck Southern drawl, I mean, stop making it
###1407 this little--
###1408 IAN WHELAN: Good old boys thing.
###1409 LEO PARENTE: In the Walmart parking lot.
###1411 IAN WHELAN: The whole heritage connection with the
###1414 moonshiners and stuff, come on.
###1416 It's been a really long time.
###1418 There is real technology and there is real advanced stuff
###1421 going on in these things.
###1422 Let's--
###1423 LEO PARENTE: Bingo.
###1423 IAN WHELAN: --bring it up to modern day.
###1425 LEO PARENTE: Yeah.
###1425 Third series, I need sports car road race.
###1428 I think we need a GT class that can be as
###1431 open tech as it is.
###1432 Everyone talks about the Corvettes we
###1434 see at these races.
###1436 If they took the restrictors off, how freaking
###1438 fast would it be?
###1438 IAN WHELAN: Oh, I'm fine with that as long as it's actually
###1440 based on a real chassis.
###1441 LEO PARENTE: Bingo.
###1442 And I can think if they want tech in it, they can
###1445 have tech in it.
###1445 I think there should be a prototype class, no
###1447 offense to the F!
###1448 cars.
###1448 I know I'm talking too much, but--
###1449 MAX SEEGER: No, no.
###1450 IAN WHELAN: No, I think it's fine if there's prototypes,
###1452 Can-Am style, that they're almost like F1 cars with body
###1456 work on them.
###1457 LEO PARENTE: Now, I'm going to drag you into this.
###1458 MAX SEEGER: OK.
###1459 LEO PARENTE: So all these road racing cars, what would make
###1461 road racing appealing to you?
###1464 MAX SEEGER: I guess the thing that would make it more
###1466 relatable for me, if it was in a place, like you said
###1469 earlier, like San Francisco or something like that, or just
###1472 something that's tight, kind of like a tighter race.
###1479 LEO PARENTE: So what if they had eliminations?
###1481 What if it was literally every weekend was a playoff, and it
###1485 took all of the entrants and cut it
###1487 down to the two finalists?
###1489 MAX SEEGER: Yeah.
###1489 LEO PARENTE: Would that change your thinking?
###1492 MAX SEEGER: I don't know.
###1492 IAN WHELAN: I don't think the manufacturers are going to
###1494 like that too much.
###1496 LEO PARENTE: It's our Etch-a-Sketch.
###1497 I don't know.
###1497 IAN WHELAN: Yeah.
###1500 But then, by the end of the year, you have what we have
###1502 now with WEC, which is two manufacturers--
###1506 LEO PARENTE: No, no.
###1506 I mean on the weekend.
###1507 IAN WHELAN: Oh, OK.
###1508 LEO PARENTE: 15 cars show up in the field.
###1509 IAN WHELAN: OK.
###1510 LEO PARENTE: Instead of qualifying, there are a
###1512 certain number of elimination races.
###1514 And at the end of the day, maybe that Sunday, you still
###1517 have an elimination race with everyone in it.
###1519 But at the end of the day, we take the two finalists and
###1521 they go head to head, somehow, some way.
###1523 MAX SEEGER: Yeah.
###1523 IAN WHELAN: OK.
###1523 LEO PARENTE: And I know everyone's going to--
###1525 MAX SEEGER: So this is two and this is one on one?
###1527 LEO PARENTE: Yeah.
###1527 At the end of it, that's how you'd stay interested, that
###1530 you watch this bad version of "American
###1532 Idol" happen on a racetrack.
###1534 MAX SEEGER: Well, I guess what would be interesting, maybe,
###1536 would be a back story of the racers with a shot.
###1541 Each one gets their lead up to this race.
###1547 IAN WHELAN: That's a--
###1548 you mentioned "American Idol." That's what they do for all
###1550 these contestants.
###1551 MAX SEEGER: Yeah.
###1551 IAN WHELAN: They have a back story so you feel like you
###1553 have a connection with these people even though you've seen
###1555 only a three-minute little video about them.
###1557 MAX SEEGER: Yeah.
###1557 LEO PARENTE: And NASCAR actually tried to get there
###1560 with this whole take the gloves off the drivers and let
###1563 them fight with each other and have that type of conflict in
###1566 personality.
###1566 IAN WHELAN: That seems contrived to me, though.
###1567 LEO PARENTE: Thank you.
###1568 OK.
###1569 Because that's the other part-- somewhere in here,
###1570 authenticity.
###1571 IAN WHELAN: Right.
###1572 LEO PARENTE: We're going too long, and I
###1573 apologize for this meeting.
###1574 But the other thing in sports car--
###1576 I want a GT class that's just the traditional, low-tech
###1580 grunty cars without all the driver controls and ABS and
###1584 traction controls so that people can get back to the
###1587 roots and enjoy just a real rough house-type race car.
###1591 MAX SEEGER: OK.
###1592 And what kind of track is that on?
###1593 IAN WHELAN: On a road course.
###1594 LEO PARENTE: Road course.
###1596 But to your point, we need to have something that's rally,
###1599 dirt, sliding, jumping.
###1602 MAX SEEGER: Yeah.
###1603 I feel like I'm coming across like this adrenaline junkie.
###1606 LEO PARENTE: No, no.
###1607 But you're not alone.
###1608 IAN WHELAN: But you like what you like, and that's why
###1609 you're here.
###1610 MAX SEEGER: Yeah, yeah.
###1610 LEO PARENTE: Let me tell you something.
###1611 There is hundreds of millions of dollars--
###1614 a billion dollars--
###1614 thrown at it, and Indy Car will run a race on the
###1617 weekend, and they'll get what?
###1618 Maybe a million people in the US, of 330
###1622 million people, watching.
###1624 IAN WHELAN: Yeah.
###1624 LEO PARENTE: So don't think you're the exception.
###1627 You're the friggin' norm with the other 229,999 million.
###1631 IAN WHELAN: Right.
###1631 And in Europe, rally racing is very popular.
###1636 It's up there.
###1636 It's up there with F1.
###1638 I don't know the numbers, but it's big compared to here.
###1641 It's not so popular.
###1642 MAX SEEGER: Yeah.
###1642 LEO PARENTE: So I know there are rally
###1645 events here in America.
###1647 And I know the Global RallyCross has done a pretty
###1649 good job of getting manufacturers engaged thanks
###1651 to ESPN and X Game.
###1653 But somewhere along the line, with this dictatorship of all
###1655 the OEMs running racing, they just need to commit to have a
###1659 bigger racing rally presence.
###1662 And this goes back to the media.
###1664 Whether it's digital or TV, it just needs to be out there so
###1668 that people know these are the special classes of racing that
###1672 define racing.
###1673 The last one-- something for bikes.
###1675 IAN WHELAN: I've watched MotoGP.
###1677 And the funny thing about that is even though I love F1 and I
###1681 like MotoGP, I think it's actually more interesting when
###1684 the bikes are more like World Superbike, where they're a
###1687 little bit--
###1687 LEO PARENTE: Production based?
###1688 IAN WHELAN: --more production based.
###1689 Because motorcycles, even the regular road-based ones that
###1693 you can buy at the dealership, are so wild with the tech and
###1696 stuff, you're already up there in technology.
###1699 So just to be able to actually have a real connection seems
###1705 even more important in that case.
###1706 LEO PARENTE: So we were on the same page
###1708 with production based.
###1709 I was going to throw something out there, and I don't
###1711 understand why this is.
###1713 Why can't I have a racing weekend where there's car
###1716 racing, and if the track allows it-- and a lot of
###1719 tracks do, like Laguna Seca's--
###1721 why don't they have the weekend with
###1723 bike being one event?
###1724 IAN WHELAN: Yeah, why not?
###1725 LEO PARENTE: And by the way, have the cars go to a bike
###1727 event and be a support race to them.
###1730 Are the fans all that different that they don't--
###1732 IAN WHELAN: No.
###1733 I think there are, obviously, support races already at
###1737 different types of race events.
###1739 But if you had more top-level racing at one event on one
###1744 weekend, that could be pretty interesting rather than the
###1748 gentlemen drivers running around in their Ferrari
###1750 Scuderias and then the F1 cars come out or whatever.
###1753 LEO PARENTE: Does racing include video games?
###1756 Does this whole redesign involved video games more than
###1760 just having licensing?
###1760 IAN WHELAN: I think it has to.
###1762 I'm not a big video game fan, but I think that it's
###1765 important for the aspect to bring new
###1768 people into the sport.
###1769 LEO PARENTE: Should I even mention it in the show?
###1772 IAN WHELAN: I think you might have to.
###1773 MAX SEEGER: Would this affect video game sales?
###1775 Or what are you saying?
###1775 LEO PARENTE: No.
###1776 Would I integrate video racing into this redesign of what
###1780 racing should be in North America?
###1780 MAX SEEGER: As a competition?
###1781 LEO PARENTE: Yeah.
###1782 IAN WHELAN: Or just to allow the fans to play a sim of
###1787 these different kinds of racing so they
###1789 can feel more involved.
###1791 MAX SEEGER: Right.
###1791 LEO PARENTE: And by the way, I don't know how far it should
###1793 go, because in Europe, and I guess in a little bit of
###1796 America, Nissan has their whole GT Academy looking for
###1799 young guys and girls to become professional racers.
###1802 MAX SEEGER: Yeah.
###1803 LEO PARENTE: Ordonez--
###1803 if I'm pronouncing it right-- he's raced at Le Mans.
###1806 He raced at Spa.
###1807 Ford has their little online version of Octane Academy,
###1810 trying to find talent.
###1812 I don't know what they're going to do with them, but
###1813 they've connected the dots between
###1816 virtual and real racing.
###1818 MAX SEEGER: Yeah.
###1818 LEO PARENTE: And rather than just sell more, how could
###1821 racing use that to get more fans into this?
###1825 And perish the thought that you have a competition where I
###1829 get to race Vettel or Dale, Jr. On the sim as part of some
###1833 other version of "American Idol" that keeps
###1835 ringing in my head.
###1836 MAX SEEGER: Hold on, one second.
###1838 Would it be possible--
###1838 LEO PARENTE: Go ahead.
###1839 MAX SEEGER: You have your guys out there on the track.
###1841 And then you have some kid in a virtual car racing them at
###1845 the same time.
###1846 LEO PARENTE: I don't see why not.
###1847 Someone tried to do that years ago.
###1848 And they were way ahead of the technology.
###1850 MAX SEEGER: How would that work?
###1850 Yeah.
###1851 IAN WHELAN: You're using the video feed from the race or
###1855 some sort of telemetry to show where the cars are.
###1858 But you're in the race as well-- the real race.
###1860 That would be cool.
###1860 LEO PARENTE: It would never interfere with the real race,
###1863 and just have the sim respect that if you bumped into one of
###1866 the real cars, you bumped into the car.
###1868 IAN WHELAN: Right.
###1868 MAX SEEGER: Right.
###1869 IAN WHELAN: That would be really cool.
###1871 LEO PARENTE: Would you want--
###1872 screw watching.
###1873 Would you do that?
###1874 MAX SEEGER: No, I don't think so.
###1875 [LAUGHTER]
###1877 IAN WHELAN: But it sounds like a good idea for people.
###1878 LEO PARENTE: OK.
###1878 Why did JF put you on the "SHAKEDOWN" team?
###1881 I'm kidding.
###1882 The only one I haven't figured out is drag racing.
###1884 But guess what?
###1885 The news is Ford cut professional drag racing.
###1888 They're dumping John Force.
###1889 They're going to just do grassroots.
###1891 But I don't know what to do about drag racing, and I
###1893 can't ignore it.
###1894 IAN WHELAN: Well, I don't know enough about
###1896 drag racing, but--
###1896 LEO PARENTE: Nor do I, I guess.
###1897 IAN WHELAN: I think, again, people have more connection to
###1900 the cars that they can relate to when they see a really--
###1904 I'm thinking back to the muscle car days.
###1907 When they can see a car going down the strip and then buy a
###1912 car just like that, that's pretty cool.
###1915 So that's all I can say about it.
###1916 I know I'm repeating myself.
###1918 MAX SEEGER: All right.
###1918 How attended are drag races?
###1921 IAN WHELAN: Professional ones?
###1922 LEO PARENTE: I haven't been in a long time, but I know the
###1924 races on the West Coast, they get a big crowd--
###1927 100,000.
###1927 MAX SEEGER: They do?
###1928 Wow.
###1928 IAN WHELAN: Wow.
###1929 That's a lot.
###1930 MAX SEEGER: So it doesn't seem like there's a problem.
###1932 LEO PARENTE: No, no.
###1932 To that point, I don't think there is a problem.
###1935 They would argue differently in terms of sponsorship and
###1938 what's going on.
###1939 But at the same point in time, what I don't want to do is
###1941 allow clutter to seep back into this
###1945 pushing racing forward.
###1946 MAX SEEGER: Yeah.
###1946 LEO PARENTE: But I'm the bad guy who said, oh, yeah.
###1948 Drag racing, forgot about that.
###1949 And I'm just throwing it out there for them.
###1952 I want to throw it out there for the crowd when
###1954 they talk about it.
###1955 MAX SEEGER: Right now, as it is, are there any events where
###1958 they have this thing that you were saying, where it's more
###1960 like an Olympics kind of thing, where if you're
###1963 watching from home, you watch the guy in the rings, and then
###1967 it goes to--
###1968 LEO PARENTE: I think the closest are Race of Champions
###1972 and the X Games.
###1975 MAX SEEGER: OK
###1976 LEO PARENTE: Yeah.
###1976 MAX SEEGER: Do you like that?
###1977 Do you think you'd stick around for the whatever you
###1981 don't like event?
###1984 IAN WHELAN: Well, this reminds me--
###1985 not to cut you off.
###1986 LEO PARENTE: Go ahead.
###1986 No.
###1987 Someone should.
###1988 IAN WHELAN: With all these different racing types within
###1990 the sanctioning body, if we could encourage the drivers to
###1993 cross over more often, that would be helpful, I think,
###1997 because if you start following a driver and you only like
###2000 that one style of racing, you might open your mind once he
###2003 goes over to this other one.
###2004 LEO PARENTE: I think that's necessarily brilliant.
###2007 That has to happen.
###2008 IAN WHELAN: I feel like that used to happen more often, not
###2010 under one sanctioning body, but--
###2012 LEO PARENTE: Well, and to that point, this is where I'm going
###2014 to put too much pressure on the manufacturers.
###2016 But since they are being allowed to run this thing,
###2021 look at Pat Long.
###2022 IAN WHELAN: Yeah.
###2022 LEO PARENTE: They shopped Pat Long around to various teams.
###2025 What we're saying is go back to the old Andretti days, and
###2029 this weekend, you're in the rally car.
###2030 IAN WHELAN: Right.
###2031 LEO PARENTE: Next weekend, you're in our open-wheel car.
###2033 IAN WHELAN: Right.
###2033 LEO PARENTE: Whatever.
###2034 IAN WHELAN: Right.
###2034 LEO PARENTE: Yeah.
###2036 I think that would interest you.
###2037 And it would build the personality of these guys--
###2039 and girls.
###2040 I keep saying that.
###2041 IAN WHELAN: And it would show how well rounded they are and
###2042 their strengths and all that, weaknesses.
###2044 LEO PARENTE: And this week, I'm watching rally, next week
###2046 I'm watching Indy, because I'm following my guy.
###2050 IAN WHELAN: Yeah.
###2051 MAX SEEGER: So are we done?
###2053 LEO PARENTE: Yeah.
###2053 Another five-minute meeting with Leo.
###2054 Thanks.
###2055 IAN WHELAN: Yeah.
###2055 LEO PARENTE: No.
###2055 Yeah, I think we're done.
###2056 And I think you gave me stuff to work on.
###2057 MAX SEEGER: Cool.
###2058 LEO PARENTE: So let me go write this damn thing.
###2059 IAN WHELAN: All right.
###2061 LEO PARENTE: Today, on "SHAKEDOWN," let's redo racing
###2063 and create the ideal North American racing set, the
###2066 collection of racing series, and race cars to get more
###2069 fans, to keep the hard-core enthusiasts happy, and to
###2072 bring in new followers without dumbing the racing down or
###2075 sensationalizing it into some version of--
###2077 I don't know--
###2078 Ricky Bobby's Death Race 3000.
###2081 So why this show?
###2082 Well, frankly, I've had it with the auto racing politics,
###2085 personal agendas, and nearsighted compromises in
###2088 racing that never seem to get us the best solutions or the
###2091 best racing.
###2092 And why a North American racing redo versus
###2095 taking on the globe?
###2096 Well, I've got to start somewhere.
###2098 This first, then we'll take on F1 Bernie and/or the FIA.
###2102 So today, let's design a series of North American
###2105 series with the cars, the action, drivers, technology,
###2109 the traditions, the tracks, the format of the racing, and
###2113 the media that would make racing be what you want and
###2116 what more people would want to follow.
###2119 And like every "SHAKEDOWN," we'll be doing our racing
###2121 redesign with your ideas and input.
###2123 We're tipping the North American auto racing
###2125 Etch-a-Sketch and turning the knob "SHAKEDOWN" way, all with
###2128 your input.
###2129 So come back, and let's see if we can out think the Indy Car
###2133 people, outsmart the SCCA, and outfox the Frances of NASCAR
###2138 and the United Sports Car Racing.
