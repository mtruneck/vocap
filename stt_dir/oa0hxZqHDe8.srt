STEVE SPANGLER: Well you've
asked for magic and today


3
0:0:1,66 --> 0:0:3,535
you're going to get it because
we're looking at the things


4
0:0:3,535 --> 0:0:4,26
that float.


5
0:0:4,26 --> 0:0:6,84
You know magicians can take
ordinary objects like this


6
0:0:6,84 --> 0:0:9,536
completely ordinary piece of
rope and cause it to float in


7
0:0:9,536 --> 0:0:11,9
the air because of their magic.


8
0:0:11,9 --> 0:0:12,68
Watch.


9
0:0:12,68 --> 0:0:14,525
I'm going cause it to float
in the air, watch.


10
0:0:14,525 --> 0:0:16,42
I'll put a spell it, float.

13
0:0:17,81 --> 0:0:19,34
Isn't that amazing?


14
0:0:19,34 --> 0:0:21,18
And then they can
break the spell.


15
0:0:21,18 --> 0:0:22,22
Break the spell.


16
0:0:22,22 --> 0:0:26,4
And then in ancient Hindu
Faquirs would be in the


17
0:0:26,4 --> 0:0:29,285
streets of India and they can
cause it float in the air like


18
0:0:29,285 --> 0:0:29,61
this, float.

about making science fun.

been teaching ways to turn

into unforgettable learning


31
0:0:57,13 --> 0:0:58,15

0:0:58,15 --> 0:1:0,905
I have an amazing team who will
do whatever it takes to

0:1:0,905 --> 0:1:4,269
affect the way people
think about science.


34
0:1:4,269 --> 0:1:6,16
And to do that I only
have one motto.


35
0:1:6,16 --> 0:1:8,905
Make it big, do it right,
give it class.

42
0:1:19,1 --> 0:1:20,43

0:1:20,43 --> 0:1:23,62
Now, I want you to put it back
in the deck wherever you want,


44
0:1:23,62 --> 0:1:24,4
that's perfect.

All right, so it's lost
in the deck, ready?

A lot of mixing around,
OK, I mixed it around.

OK, now I'm going to find your
card and I'm going to cause it

Well here, every man
has one of these.


121
0:3:27,32 --> 0:3:30,16
All right, so you take a regular
handkerchief like this


122
0:3:30,16 --> 0:3:31,62
and you take your hair
out, [WHOOSH]


123
0:3:31,62 --> 0:3:33,38
and you tie it onto
this thing here.


124
0:3:33,38 --> 0:3:35,55
And then you tie it here like
this, and then you pull it


125
0:3:35,55 --> 0:3:37,77
down, and it floats.


126
0:3:37,77 --> 0:3:42,6
And then you take your scissors
and you cut it.


127
0:3:42,6 --> 0:3:44,67

128
0:3:44,67 --> 0:3:47,39

busy for hours.

come over here.

recycled plastic
water bottles.


133
0:3:58,58 --> 0:4:0,64
All right, so the rice goes
down inside like this.


134
0:4:0,64 --> 0:4:3,54
You simply fill the container
up like this.


135
0:4:3,54 --> 0:4:5,42
And you're going to do two of
them so you want them to be


136
0:4:5,42 --> 0:4:6,55
exactly the same.


137
0:4:6,55 --> 0:4:8,83
And so you can see they'll the
same, I filled that one

0:4:8,83 --> 0:4:9,115
previously.

two chop sticks.

All right, so here's
what you do.

0:4:14,59 --> 0:4:17,19
You take your hand and you
plunge it in like this.


144
0:4:17,19 --> 0:4:20,339
And now, only using your
fingertips you pick this up


145
0:4:20,339 --> 0:4:22,49

it comes out.

chopsticks and there's a

0:4:31,12 --> 0:4:32,17
secret with that.


151
0:4:32,17 --> 0:4:33,28

again, watch this.

it goes in here like and now

defying rice and


158
0:4:47,1 --> 0:4:49,726
this is heavy rice.

the rice flows out like this.

There is absolutely nothing
wrong with it.

0:4:58,98 --> 0:5:1,98
If you look, there's nothing
hiding in the bottles.

same amount of rice.


166
0:5:4,975 --> 0:5:7,82

Well of course it's not
magic, it's science.


168
0:5:9,81 --> 0:5:12,26
And it actually is about the
science of friction.


169
0:5:12,26 --> 0:5:15,28
And the guy who discovered
friction, right here.

it was Leonardo da Vinci

that back up on my wall?


179
0:5:34,666 --> 0:5:35,47
BRYAN HIGGENS: Yep.


180
0:5:35,47 --> 0:5:36,88
STEVE SPANGLER: Could
you maybe work on


181

your script as well?

184
0:5:44,18 --> 0:5:45,9
What you see is what you get.


185
0:5:45,9 --> 0:5:46,43
You're going to need
the materials that


186
0:5:46,43 --> 0:5:47,17
I showed you before.


187
0:5:47,17 --> 0:5:50,15
Two empty water bottles, some
rice, some chopsticks.


188
0:5:50,15 --> 0:5:51,7
That's it.


189
0:5:51,7 --> 0:5:53,81
It's how the rice goes into the
bottle that's the secret.


190
0:5:53,81 --> 0:5:55,72
Let's do the light rice first.


191
0:5:55,72 --> 0:5:58,45
This is the gimmick-ed
bottle so to speak.


192
0:5:58,45 --> 0:6:0,12
So we're going to fill
it up with rice.


193
0:6:0,12 --> 0:6:2,79
Keep on putting rice in
here until it's full.


194
0:6:2,79 --> 0:6:5,5
Have you ever seen that old
puzzle where they fill a


195
0:6:5,5 --> 0:6:8,5
bottle with something, like
pebbles and they say, is the


196
0:6:8,5 --> 0:6:9,2
bottle full?


197
0:6:9,2 --> 0:6:12,88
It's filled to the top with
pebbles and somebody says yes.


198
0:6:12,88 --> 0:6:13,197
And you go no, no, no.


199
0:6:13,197 --> 0:6:16,5
And then they start pouring in
sand and now the sand fills up


200
0:6:16,5 --> 0:6:17,115
the little crevices.


201
0:6:17,115 --> 0:6:18,21
And they say is it full?


202
0:6:18,21 --> 0:6:19,21
And everybody says yes.


203
0:6:19,21 --> 0:6:19,91
And you go no.


204
0:6:19,91 --> 0:6:21,48
And finally they fill
it with water.


205
0:6:21,48 --> 0:6:23,24
And only at that point
is it full.


206
0:6:23,24 --> 0:6:25,45
Well that's a long way of being
able to tell you that


207
0:6:25,45 --> 0:6:28,71
this bottle is not full even
though it looks like it's


208
0:6:28,71 --> 0:6:31,49
filled to the top with
rice, like this.


209
0:6:31,49 --> 0:6:33,9
All right, see, it's full.


210
0:6:33,9 --> 0:6:35,11
But it's not really full.


211
0:6:35,11 --> 0:6:36,23
Here, watch this.


212
0:6:36,23 --> 0:6:37,66
All you have to do is tap it.


213
0:6:37,66 --> 0:6:40,87
And watch how the rice
begins to compact.


214
0:6:40,87 --> 0:6:43,65
Look at how far down
it will go.


215
0:6:43,65 --> 0:6:45,38
These plastic water
bottles are great.


216
0:6:45,38 --> 0:6:47,53
The original-- this is an old,
old magic trick and so the


217
0:6:47,53 --> 0:6:50,2
original one were these kind
of fancy glass bottles, but


218
0:6:50,2 --> 0:6:51,1
these work so well.


219
0:6:51,1 --> 0:6:52,72
See how much more rice
I can get in.


220
0:6:52,72 --> 0:6:53,86
All right, back to this.


221
0:6:53,86 --> 0:6:56,26
Some more will go in, I'll even
push it in with my thumb


222
0:6:56,26 --> 0:6:56,91
a little bit.


223
0:6:56,91 --> 0:6:57,97
A little bit here.


224
0:6:57,97 --> 0:7:1,13
Tap it down.


225
0:7:1,13 --> 0:7:2,93
It'll even take a
little bit more.


226
0:7:2,93 --> 0:7:4,6
All right, we don't want to
make it look too obvious.


227
0:7:4,6 --> 0:7:8,9
All right, so this here is hard
to squeeze, there's a lot


228
0:7:8,9 --> 0:7:9,43
rice that's in here.


229
0:7:9,43 --> 0:7:12,26
This bottle here, we're going to
fill up, no tapping at all.


230
0:7:12,26 --> 0:7:14,14
We really want it to be
very, very fluffy.


231
0:7:14,14 --> 0:7:16,85



232
0:7:16,85 --> 0:7:18,8
I'm trying not to tap
this down at all.


233
0:7:18,8 --> 0:7:21,39
I want this to be nice and
fluffy, for there to be a lot


234
0:7:21,39 --> 0:7:24,6
of space in between all
those pieces of rice.


235
0:7:24,6 --> 0:7:27,44
All right, I think it's really
good at the very end to put it


236
0:7:27,44 --> 0:7:29,82
in there when you're actually
doing the trick so it makes it


237
0:7:29,82 --> 0:7:31,17
seem like they're exactly
the same.


238
0:7:31,17 --> 0:7:32,69
All right, so here's what's
going to happen.


239
0:7:32,69 --> 0:7:33,38
I'll spin these around.


240
0:7:33,38 --> 0:7:35,6
This will be light one
of course, and this


241
0:7:35,6 --> 0:7:35,8
is the heavy one.


242
0:7:35,8 --> 0:7:38,23
See, this one already started
to go down a little bit, so


243
0:7:38,23 --> 0:7:39,33
you can fill it up.


244
0:7:39,33 --> 0:7:42,76
All right, with the chopstick,
this one extremely easy to be


245
0:7:42,76 --> 0:7:45,51
able to push in because that
chopstick is going in between


246
0:7:45,51 --> 0:7:47,71
those kernels of rice with
no problem at all.


247
0:7:47,71 --> 0:7:49,96
But this one here is pretty
amazing because when you push


248
0:7:49,96 --> 0:7:52,78
it down here like this, it's so
full but you can actually


249
0:7:52,78 --> 0:7:53,45
hear it, listen.


250
0:7:53,45 --> 0:7:54,85
[RICE CRUNCHING].


251
0:7:54,85 --> 0:7:55,68
Hear it going in?


252
0:7:55,68 --> 0:7:58,45
What's happening are all those
pieces of rice are realigning


253
0:7:58,45 --> 0:7:59,64
themselves this way.


254
0:7:59,64 --> 0:8:2,85
They are actually digging
into the piece of wood.


255
0:8:2,85 --> 0:8:5,14
So no wonder when you try to
pick up this one here, of


256
0:8:5,14 --> 0:8:7,9
course it doesn't work at all.


257
0:8:7,9 --> 0:8:10,25
And this one here, absolutely
no problem at all.


258
0:8:10,25 --> 0:8:13,87
It's fun to do with a friend,
you're the magician and your


259
0:8:13,87 --> 0:8:15,59
friend can't do it and
you can do it.


260
0:8:15,59 --> 0:8:18,4
And the secret of course,
is friction


261
0:8:18,4 --> 0:8:21,8
with Leonardo da Vinci.


262
0:8:21,8 --> 0:8:23,38
Now here's the problem.


263
0:8:23,38 --> 0:8:25,33
When you go to pull this one out
here, it's a little harder


264
0:8:25,33 --> 0:8:25,84
to pull out.


265
0:8:25,84 --> 0:8:27,98
You will want to put your
fingers here and pull a little


266
0:8:27,98 --> 0:8:29,31
bit so it looks natural.


267
0:8:29,31 --> 0:8:31,66
There's more rice in this
one than this one.


268
0:8:31,66 --> 0:8:34,97
So when you go to dump it, as
you're talking, begin to pour


269
0:8:34,97 --> 0:8:35,73
this one first.


270
0:8:35,73 --> 0:8:38,89
So you can say, all I used
was regular rice, watch.


271
0:8:38,89 --> 0:8:41,39
And now it begins to pour
because I had that little bit


272
0:8:41,39 --> 0:8:42,289
a head start.


273
0:8:42,289 --> 0:8:45,43
When they flow, they should
both kind of fall out, you


274
0:8:45,43 --> 0:8:48,44
hope, as you are shaking them
out exactly the same.


275
0:8:48,44 --> 0:8:50,38
Bingo, and you've got it.


276
0:8:50,38 --> 0:8:52,3
Not a bad way to do it.


277
0:8:52,3 --> 0:8:53,89
The other secret, believe
it or not is the


278
0:8:53,89 --> 0:8:54,72
shape of the bottle.


279
0:8:54,72 --> 0:8:56,8
You need to have a bottle
where the neck


280
0:8:56,8 --> 0:8:58,4
comes up like this.


281
0:8:58,4 --> 0:9:1,23
In doing so when you push this
down, it actually allows the


282
0:9:1,23 --> 0:9:4,64
rice to push up against that
neck and create the friction


283
0:9:4,64 --> 0:9:6,5
that you need to pick
up the bottle.


284
0:9:6,5 --> 0:9:8,35
If you use another container
like this, even though there's


285
0:9:8,35 --> 0:9:9,47
a lot of rice packed in there.


286
0:9:9,47 --> 0:9:12,38
No matter what you do, it won't
pick up the container.


287
0:9:12,38 --> 0:9:14,41
[DOOR CLOSING]


288
0:9:14,41 --> 0:9:18,92
Well for this trick you're using
unpopped popcorn and a


289
0:9:18,92 --> 0:9:21,56
steel ball bearing.


290
0:9:21,56 --> 0:9:22,56
All right, watch this.


291
0:9:22,56 --> 0:9:24,93
The ball bearing goes into the
corn and most people don't


292
0:9:24,93 --> 0:9:28,91
realize that corn and the ball
bearing have this chemical


293
0:9:28,91 --> 0:9:29,51
reaction here.


294
0:9:29,51 --> 0:9:32,84
Watch this, I'll spin
it around, watch.


295
0:9:32,84 --> 0:9:36,38
And you'll see that magically,
it turns


296
0:9:36,38 --> 0:9:39,17
into a ping pong ball.


297
0:9:39,17 --> 0:9:41,24
It doesn't take a rocket
scientist to figure this out.


298
0:9:41,24 --> 0:9:43,97
Look at the secret,
it's there.


299
0:9:43,97 --> 0:9:44,97
Here's the ball bearing.


300
0:9:44,97 --> 0:9:47,4
This is a density
demonstration.


301
0:9:47,4 --> 0:9:50,96
So watch, the little ball
hides under the


302
0:9:50,96 --> 0:9:53,22
surface, like this.


303
0:9:53,22 --> 0:9:54,95
Now nobody knows that it's
there, it's perfect.


304
0:9:54,95 --> 0:9:57,7
So now if you take the ball
bearing, and you drop the ball


305
0:9:57,7 --> 0:10:0,12
bearing in, this eventually, as
you start moving it around


306
0:10:0,12 --> 0:10:1,54
will sink down.


307
0:10:1,54 --> 0:10:4,39
And believe it or not, the corn
will help push the ping


308
0:10:4,39 --> 0:10:6,26
pong ball up so as you are
holding it here like this,


309
0:10:6,26 --> 0:10:8,51
here watch.


310
0:10:8,51 --> 0:10:11,83
Ta da.


311
0:10:11,83 --> 0:10:14,18
So if you're teaching science,
what does this teach?


312
0:10:14,18 --> 0:10:15,26
Basically nothing.


313
0:10:15,26 --> 0:10:17,62
I don't know, you can tie it
into density if you wanted to.


314
0:10:17,62 --> 0:10:20,24
I think it's a cool trick.


315
0:10:20,24 --> 0:10:22,4
Ah.


316
0:10:22,4 --> 0:10:23,62
Well for this little gem you are
going to need to have some


317
0:10:23,62 --> 0:10:24,53
table salt.


318
0:10:24,53 --> 0:10:25,47
And where to you get
the table salt?


319
0:10:25,47 --> 0:10:27,15
From your friend's
mom's house.


320
0:10:27,15 --> 0:10:29,29
While you are there, get
yourself her credit card


321
0:10:29,29 --> 0:10:30,555
because you're going
to need to also


322
0:10:30,555 --> 0:10:31,68
get a baby soda bottle.


323
0:10:31,68 --> 0:10:33,3
Where do you baby soda bottle?


324
0:10:33,3 --> 0:10:34,11
A website called


325
0:10:34,11 --> 0:10:37,22
stevespanglerscience.com [BEEP]


326
0:10:37,22 --> 0:10:40,52
I've been asked to remove
that one offensive part.


327
0:10:40,52 --> 0:10:43,32
Forget the friends get the
salt from your own house.


328
0:10:43,32 --> 0:10:46,19



329
0:10:46,19 --> 0:10:48,0
So this is more of a puzzle
than a magic trick


330
0:10:48,0 --> 0:10:48,78
but it is very cool.


331
0:10:48,78 --> 0:10:50,76
So you fill this little
test tube.


332
0:10:50,76 --> 0:10:52,94
You can use anything that's like
this, but this test tube


333
0:10:52,94 --> 0:10:54,41
works really, really well.


334
0:10:54,41 --> 0:10:56,6
You fill it up with
salt, like this.


335
0:10:56,6 --> 0:11:0,53
Then you take an ordinary
marble and drop it in.


336
0:11:0,53 --> 0:11:2,14
And now you put the cap
on top like this.


337
0:11:2,14 --> 0:11:3,8
That's why we like to use these


338
0:11:3,8 --> 0:11:4,55
little baby soda bottles.


339
0:11:4,55 --> 0:11:7,47
And now the object is this, is
to ask a friend, again a


340
0:11:7,47 --> 0:11:11,11
puzzle, to move that little
marble from one end to the


341
0:11:11,11 --> 0:11:12,75
other end as fast as they can.


342
0:11:12,75 --> 0:11:14,7
And they're going to try
to shake it like this.


343
0:11:14,7 --> 0:11:16,75
And they are going to try to
move it down here like this.


344
0:11:16,75 --> 0:11:19,68
It really is tough to move it
down, especially if there's


345
0:11:19,68 --> 0:11:21,11
some time involved with it.


346
0:11:21,11 --> 0:11:21,92
It'll take them forever.


347
0:11:21,92 --> 0:11:23,46
If you're a baby sitter,
this is perfect.


348
0:11:23,46 --> 0:11:25,23
It'll keep the kid
busy for hours.


349
0:11:25,23 --> 0:11:26,7
And if you're ever babysitting
for Higgensworth,


350
0:11:26,7 --> 0:11:29,72
it'll take him days.


351
0:11:29,72 --> 0:11:30,71
Ta da.


352
0:11:30,71 --> 0:11:33,14
That only took me about
10 minutes.


353
0:11:33,14 --> 0:11:36,1
There's an easier way to move
that little marble from one


354
0:11:36,1 --> 0:11:36,67
end to the other.


355
0:11:36,67 --> 0:11:37,73
And the secret is this.


356
0:11:37,73 --> 0:11:39,225
If you turn the whole thing
upside down, so see it's at


357
0:11:39,225 --> 0:11:39,64
the bottom.


358
0:11:39,64 --> 0:11:41,9
If you want to move into
the top, here's


359
0:11:41,9 --> 0:11:41,98
what you have to do.


360
0:11:41,98 --> 0:11:44,54
You have to send everything up
into the air and when you do


361
0:11:44,54 --> 0:11:48,3
that, the salt will work its way
underneath the marble and


362
0:11:48,3 --> 0:11:50,59
literally begin to push the
marble to the very top.


363
0:11:50,59 --> 0:11:53,87
So you have this motion of up
and down and let it fall down.


364
0:11:53,87 --> 0:11:54,96
And there it is.


365
0:11:54,96 --> 0:11:58,1
So in a matter of seconds,
it's at the top.


366
0:11:58,1 --> 0:12:0,755
This is a perfect technique for
getting the toy surprise


367
0:12:0,755 --> 0:12:3,68
out of your cereal.


368
0:12:3,68 --> 0:12:5,35
You know how they put the
toy surprise in there?


369
0:12:5,35 --> 0:12:6,72
It's never at the top
where you want it.


370
0:12:6,72 --> 0:12:8,2
And you have to get your
hand in here and


371
0:12:8,2 --> 0:12:8,75
you have to dig around.


372
0:12:8,75 --> 0:12:10,93
And you've got dirty hands,
[SNOT BLOW], then all of a


373
0:12:10,93 --> 0:12:12,75
sudden nobody wants
your cereal.


374
0:12:12,75 --> 0:12:15,64
So here's how you get the
toy surprise to the top.


375
0:12:15,64 --> 0:12:18,7
You go like this, and you
shake it up like this.


376
0:12:18,7 --> 0:12:23,0
So if you give it a shake, now
that toy surprise will slowly


377
0:12:23,0 --> 0:12:25,11
work its way to the top.


378
0:12:25,11 --> 0:12:26,24
Ta da.


379
0:12:26,24 --> 0:12:27,6
It's at the top.


380
0:12:27,6 --> 0:12:28,93
Who put this in here?


381
0:12:28,93 --> 0:12:32,382
That's not funny.

0:12:32,382 --> 0:12:33,306
[DOOR CLOSING]


383
0:12:33,306 --> 0:12:35,39
All right, now let's do
a real magic trick.


384
0:12:35,39 --> 0:12:36,98
This is very, very cool.


385
0:12:36,98 --> 0:12:39,14
It uses two glass bottles.


386
0:12:39,14 --> 0:12:41,55
These were, I don't know, water
bottles or something.


387
0:12:41,55 --> 0:12:42,88
And two pieces of rope.


388
0:12:42,88 --> 0:12:44,79
So examine them, make
sure they're OK.


389
0:12:44,79 --> 0:12:48,17
They should be absolutely
the same.


390
0:12:48,17 --> 0:12:49,9
OK?


391
0:12:49,9 --> 0:12:49,98
So here's what we're
going to do.


392
0:12:49,98 --> 0:12:54,12
I want you to pick one of the
bottles, left or right?


393
0:12:54,12 --> 0:12:55,14
Bingo.


394
0:12:55,14 --> 0:12:57,8
Pick one of the pieces of
rope, it doesn't matter.


395
0:12:57,8 --> 0:12:58,53
Got it, all right.


396
0:12:58,53 --> 0:13:1,17
This is called do as I do.


397
0:13:1,17 --> 0:13:3,4

you're going to ask him to put


398
0:13:3,4 --> 0:13:4,48
the rope inside the bottle.


399
0:13:4,48 --> 0:13:6,37
Higgins, put the rope
inside the bottle.


400
0:13:6,37 --> 0:13:7,99
Do as I do, like this.


401
0:13:7,99 --> 0:13:8,17
BRYAN HIGGENS: OK.


402
0:13:8,17 --> 0:13:9,79
STEVE SPANGLER: OK, put it in.


403
0:13:9,79 --> 0:13:11,28
Hold it in your hand
like this.


404
0:13:11,28 --> 0:13:14,32
And now turn it upside-- hold it
like this-- turn it upside


405
0:13:14,32 --> 0:13:17,35
down and cause the rope to
float in the bottle.


406
0:13:17,35 --> 0:13:20,14
Ha, ha, ha, ha.


407
0:13:20,14 --> 0:13:23,34
No it's because I have a magic
spell on mine, so watch.


408
0:13:23,34 --> 0:13:24,545
You take the rope like this.


409
0:13:24,545 --> 0:13:24,82
BRYAN HIGGENS: OK.


410
0:13:24,82 --> 0:13:27,22
STEVE SPANGLER: And put it in
here like this, got it?


411
0:13:27,22 --> 0:13:31,28
Good and now turn
it upside down.


412
0:13:31,28 --> 0:13:34,6
And it floats.


413
0:13:34,6 --> 0:13:35,66
And then you take it
like this and the


414
0:13:35,66 --> 0:13:38,52
bottle floats like this.


415
0:13:38,52 --> 0:13:40,4
So when you put yours
inside like this,


416
0:13:40,4 --> 0:13:41,13
it'll float like that.


417
0:13:41,13 --> 0:13:44,6
And when you want to release
the spell, then it's gone.


418
0:13:44,6 --> 0:13:45,35
See how that works?


419
0:13:45,35 --> 0:13:47,4
So I could put this in
here like this, you


420
0:13:47,4 --> 0:13:47,83
turn it upside down.


421
0:13:47,83 --> 0:13:48,62
You go wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.


422
0:13:48,62 --> 0:13:51,49
There's actually a genie inside
the bottle and then the


423
0:13:51,49 --> 0:13:53,2
genie holds onto the rope.


424
0:13:53,2 --> 0:13:54,62
It hangs onto it like this.


425
0:13:54,62 --> 0:13:57,2
And you can release the little
genie down inside by pushing


426
0:13:57,2 --> 0:13:58,53
the rope down in here
and wiggling.


427
0:13:58,53 --> 0:13:59,76
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.


428
0:13:59,76 --> 0:14:0,67
And the genie comes out.


429
0:14:0,67 --> 0:14:1,89
See how it works?


430
0:14:1,89 --> 0:14:2,66
You probably think it's--


431
0:14:2,66 --> 0:14:3,28
BRYAN HIGGENS: There's
no genie in mine.


432
0:14:3,28 --> 0:14:5,85
STEVE SPANGLER: See, maybe you
need a different bottle.


433
0:14:5,85 --> 0:14:6,205
So here, take my bottle.


434
0:14:6,205 --> 0:14:7,11
Take my rope.


435
0:14:7,11 --> 0:14:7,95
I'll take your robe.


436
0:14:7,95 --> 0:14:8,78
I'll take your bottle.


437
0:14:8,78 --> 0:14:9,49
Watch this.


438
0:14:9,49 --> 0:14:11,75
Take the piece of rope, put it
down inside, turn the whole


439
0:14:11,75 --> 0:14:13,3
thing upside down.


440
0:14:13,3 --> 0:14:14,43
Let go, wiggle, wiggle,
wiggle.


441
0:14:14,43 --> 0:14:15,6
See it stays here like this.


442
0:14:15,6 --> 0:14:16,45
Turn it upside down.


443
0:14:16,45 --> 0:14:19,62
And it floats like magic.


444
0:14:19,62 --> 0:14:22,6
And that's how you do a special
little trick called


445
0:14:22,6 --> 0:14:24,66
the prayer vase.


446
0:14:24,66 --> 0:14:25,43
Did you get it Higgens?


447
0:14:25,43 --> 0:14:27,7
BRYAN HIGGENS: No, not yet.


448
0:14:27,7 --> 0:14:29,99
STEVE SPANGLER: OK, go and let
it go, it'll be perfect.


449
0:14:29,99 --> 0:14:33,6
This is actually an IQ test so
if you can do it on the first


450
0:14:33,6 --> 0:14:34,42
try, you're pretty smart.


451
0:14:34,42 --> 0:14:36,48
And if you do this,
really smart.


452
0:14:36,48 --> 0:14:40,55
So here's, believe it
or not the secret.


453
0:14:40,55 --> 0:14:42,46
A little bit of aluminum foil.


454
0:14:42,46 --> 0:14:44,103
All right, you're not going to
need much, you are going to


455
0:14:44,103 --> 0:14:48,84
tear off a little square of
aluminum foil like this.


456
0:14:48,84 --> 0:14:52,78
And what we need is we need
something that will hook onto


457
0:14:52,78 --> 0:14:53,63
the rope inside.


458
0:14:53,63 --> 0:14:55,9
So what I want you to do
is fold it up like


459
0:14:55,9 --> 0:14:56,85
this and make a ball.


460
0:14:56,85 --> 0:14:59,3
So you're going to want to
squeeze this down so that it


461
0:14:59,3 --> 0:15:2,58
very easily falls right
into the bottle.


462
0:15:2,58 --> 0:15:4,89
The original ones from the magic
shop would use a little


463
0:15:4,89 --> 0:15:7,36
piece of cork that somebody
had worked on.


464
0:15:7,36 --> 0:15:9,21
I think the aluminum foil
works perfectly.


465
0:15:9,21 --> 0:15:11,95
And you can keep on working it
and it will fall into the


466
0:15:11,95 --> 0:15:14,4
bottle with no problem at all.


467
0:15:14,4 --> 0:15:15,3
Here's what's great
about this bottle.


468
0:15:15,3 --> 0:15:16,7
I happened to find it.


469
0:15:16,7 --> 0:15:18,7
It's this blue which
I thought was cool.


470
0:15:18,7 --> 0:15:21,76
I took some black spray paint
and actually shot it inside


471
0:15:21,76 --> 0:15:23,98
the bottle here so that
you can't see


472
0:15:23,98 --> 0:15:24,8
through the neck here.


473
0:15:24,8 --> 0:15:27,9
You can see a little bit through
here which is great,


474
0:15:27,9 --> 0:15:28,74
but you can't see through
the neck.


475
0:15:28,74 --> 0:15:31,5
So when you drop this down
inside you can't-- nobody


476
0:15:31,5 --> 0:15:33,63
really sees, it's on the bottom
and when it's trapped


477
0:15:33,63 --> 0:15:36,16
there in the little neck, nobody
can see it at all.


478
0:15:36,16 --> 0:15:38,64
But so you can see what's going
on, let's trade out for


479
0:15:38,64 --> 0:15:39,81
a clear bottle.


480
0:15:39,81 --> 0:15:43,4
At the very beginning I had the
little piece of aluminum


481
0:15:43,4 --> 0:15:44,9
foil in my finger like this.


482
0:15:44,9 --> 0:15:47,12
So it's called a finger
palm, or a clip.


483
0:15:47,12 --> 0:15:48,97
So it's being held
here in my hand.


484
0:15:48,97 --> 0:15:51,23
And you turn your hand over and
it looks fairly natural.


485
0:15:51,23 --> 0:15:53,75
Now if you sit here and you're
worried about, then everybody


486
0:15:53,75 --> 0:15:54,44
going to know that it's
in your hand.


487
0:15:54,44 --> 0:15:54,83
But you're not.


488
0:15:54,83 --> 0:15:57,12
Here's a piece of rope and
here are the bottles.


489
0:15:57,12 --> 0:15:59,91
And pretend like we had these
two bottles, that's fine, OK?


490
0:15:59,91 --> 0:16:1,72
But I'm going to show you
how it works with it.


491
0:16:1,72 --> 0:16:4,5
So the little ball goes
down inside and now


492
0:16:4,5 --> 0:16:5,38
we're ready to go.


493
0:16:5,38 --> 0:16:7,88
I'll show you about how to load
it in here in a second,


494
0:16:7,88 --> 0:16:9,15
but I want to show
you how it works.


495
0:16:9,15 --> 0:16:11,8
First of all you take the piece
of rope and the rope


496
0:16:11,8 --> 0:16:11,88
goes down inside.


497
0:16:11,88 --> 0:16:13,94
When you turn it upside down,
look at what happens.


498
0:16:13,94 --> 0:16:17,37
The little ball gets lodged
between the rope and the side


499
0:16:17,37 --> 0:16:18,5
of the bottle.


500
0:16:18,5 --> 0:16:20,53
So now we've set up some
fraction that's here.


501
0:16:20,53 --> 0:16:21,47
Pull and you can see.


502
0:16:21,47 --> 0:16:24,23
So when you let go nobody can
see this because again, that


503
0:16:24,23 --> 0:16:25,42
neck is black.


504
0:16:25,42 --> 0:16:26,51
So you can't see it.


505
0:16:26,51 --> 0:16:29,19
And now when you turn it upside
down, the rope hangs


506
0:16:29,19 --> 0:16:30,2
which is beautiful.


507
0:16:30,2 --> 0:16:32,17
Now to release it, all you have
to do is put your hand


508
0:16:32,17 --> 0:16:32,77
here like this.


509
0:16:32,77 --> 0:16:35,71
And when you put your hand on
it, it the rope down enough to


510
0:16:35,71 --> 0:16:36,95
be able to release the ball.


511
0:16:36,95 --> 0:16:38,78
I can easily release
this and I can do


512
0:16:38,78 --> 0:16:39,58
the whole thing again.


513
0:16:39,58 --> 0:16:42,15
And if they ever it to say
there's something in the


514
0:16:42,15 --> 0:16:45,13
bottle you simply turn it upside
down and draw attention


515
0:16:45,13 --> 0:16:46,34
to something on the bottom.


516
0:16:46,34 --> 0:16:48,72
All that's really doing is
loading that ball back into


517
0:16:48,72 --> 0:16:49,9
your fingers like this.


518
0:16:49,9 --> 0:16:52,8
You pull it back out and you
hand them the bottle.


519
0:16:52,8 --> 0:16:54,74
You take this bottle here and
you say see, mine's the same.


520
0:16:54,74 --> 0:16:57,79
I loaded it back in and now I'm
ready to go once again.


521
0:16:57,79 --> 0:16:59,75
It's tricky.


522
0:16:59,75 --> 0:17:1,33
All right, so let's see if
my student can do it.


523
0:17:1,33 --> 0:17:2,79
Ready, hold it in your finger
like that, you got it?


524
0:17:2,79 --> 0:17:4,869
Turn it upside down, load
it in, perfect.


525
0:17:4,869 --> 0:17:6,71
Turn it back over, perfect.


526
0:17:6,71 --> 0:17:7,27
Nobody hears.


527
0:17:7,27 --> 0:17:10,349
Now this goes in here like this,
turn it upside down.


528
0:17:10,349 --> 0:17:13,79
Wiggle, there's a little genie
inside, do you have it?


529
0:17:13,79 --> 0:17:13,873
Ah.


530
0:17:13,873 --> 0:17:14,67
Bingo.


531
0:17:14,67 --> 0:17:16,48
And now take and swing it.


532
0:17:16,48 --> 0:17:18,18
[SWOOSH]


533
0:17:18,18 --> 0:17:20,0
You, see you are amazing.


534
0:17:20,0 --> 0:17:22,109
All right, so now put
it back down again.


535
0:17:22,109 --> 0:17:24,13
Push it down a little bit
because that will release it,


536
0:17:24,13 --> 0:17:25,47
so you're going to have
to do it here close.


537
0:17:25,47 --> 0:17:27,2
So release it, good job.


538
0:17:27,2 --> 0:17:28,69
Pull it back out again
and you've done it.


539
0:17:28,69 --> 0:17:29,66
BRYAN HIGGENS: Awesome.


540
0:17:29,66 --> 0:17:31,1
STEVE SPANGLER: That's
awesome.


541
0:17:31,1 --> 0:17:34,7
And now you know the science
of things that float.


542
0:17:34,7 --> 0:17:35,12
You did a good job.


543
0:17:35,12 --> 0:17:38,8
Now if you get this and
the rope thing in the


544
0:17:38,8 --> 0:17:39,4
handkerchief or--


545
0:17:39,4 --> 0:17:40,7
you could do kid's
birthday parties.


546
0:17:40,7 --> 0:17:42,16
You could put it all
in a little tub.


547
0:17:42,16 --> 0:17:43,36
BRYAN HIGGENS: That's true.


548
0:17:43,36 --> 0:17:44,3
STEVE SPANGLER: My
boys are having a


549
0:17:44,3 --> 0:17:45,94
birthday party next Saturday.


550
0:17:45,94 --> 0:17:46,25
BRYAN HIGGENS: Why didn't
I see this coming?


551
0:17:46,25 --> 0:17:48,85
STEVE SPANGLER: And you should
put it all there because the


552
0:17:48,85 --> 0:17:50,6
kids would love to
see you there.


553
0:17:50,6 --> 0:17:52,47
You could maybe make a
little extra money.


554
0:17:52,47 --> 0:17:54,84
Not from me of course, but if
you did a good job on mine,


555
0:17:54,84 --> 0:17:57,36
there might be some neighbors
that would want you to come.


556
0:17:57,36 --> 0:17:58,28
BRYAN HIGGENS: All right.


557
0:17:58,28 --> 0:17:59,835
STEVE SPANGLER: Maybe some
YouTube viewers would like you


558
0:17:59,835 --> 0:18:1,115
to come their house too.


559
0:18:1,115 --> 0:18:1,93
BRYAN HIGGENS: I'll let
you know Steve.


560
0:18:1,93 --> 0:18:2,89
STEVE SPANGLER: I think
you should do that.


561
0:18:2,89 --> 0:18:4,13
And then you're not going to let
me know, I need you there


562
0:18:4,13 --> 0:18:4,93
at the house.


563
0:18:4,93 --> 0:18:7,37
So it's next-- if you take out
your phone, all right, write


564
0:18:7,37 --> 0:18:8,95
this date down, OK?


565
0:18:8,95 --> 0:18:9,41
BRYAN HIGGENS: All right.


566
0:18:9,41 --> 0:18:10,97
STEVE SPANGLER: It's next week,
it's next Saturday.


567
0:18:10,97 --> 0:18:12,8
If you come a half an hour
early, we got to get the


568
0:18:12,8 --> 0:18:15,46
backyard set up so.


569
0:18:15,46 --> 0:18:16,25
So that would be perfect.


570
0:18:16,25 --> 0:18:17,56
Press Save, save.


571
0:18:17,56 --> 0:18:18,86
Good.


572
0:18:18,86 --> 0:18:21,246
So if I were, I'd
get practicing.


573
0:18:21,246 --> 0:18:22,72
You are going to
do a good job.


574
0:18:22,72 --> 0:18:23,85
My kids are going to love you.


575
0:18:23,85 --> 0:18:26,4
And if they're bad, we're going
to shut this circus down


576
0:18:26,4 --> 0:18:29,408
like they were bad at the last
magician, but they've learned.


577
0:18:29,408 --> 0:18:29,896
OK?


578
0:18:29,896 --> 0:18:30,39
You'll going to do great.


579
0:18:30,39 --> 0:18:31,614
My kids are going to love you

0:18:31,614 --> 0:18:54,27
[MUSIC PLAYING]


581
0:18:54,27 --> 0:18:57,12
STEVE SPANGLER: If I were to
ask this what this is, you


582
0:18:57,12 --> 0:18:58,78
would probably say a pitcher
full of milk.


583
0:18:58,78 --> 0:19:2,22
But what it really is
is evaporated milk.


584
0:19:2,22 --> 0:19:4,481
Let me show you what I mean.


585
0:19:4,481 --> 0:19:11,12
I'll pour the milk into the cone
and all it takes for the


586
0:19:11,12 --> 0:19:13,59
milk to evaporate is
my magic wand.

0:19:18,46 --> 0:19:19,44
