1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:19,96



2
0:0:19,96 --> 0:0:21,22
Yo, what up?


3
0:0:21,22 --> 0:0:25,4
This is Nas, and this is like a
crazy party, a crazy thing I


4
0:0:25,4 --> 0:0:26,74
remember from back
in the days.


5
0:0:26,74 --> 0:0:29,38
I used to live in the projects,
and we were always


6
0:0:29,38 --> 0:0:31,52
trying to throw parties
in the neighborhood.


7
0:0:31,52 --> 0:0:34,61
Usually a girl whose parents
were out of town, that was


8
0:0:34,61 --> 0:0:36,72
always the place.


9
0:0:36,72 --> 0:0:39,47
We were throwing one party
one night for some girl.


10
0:0:39,47 --> 0:0:45,75
We had the speakers, drinks,
no lights on, sweaty.


11
0:0:45,75 --> 0:0:48,74
There'd be a party going on.


12
0:0:48,74 --> 0:0:53,1
This older guy we know who's
known as the brawler, he's


13
0:0:53,1 --> 0:0:55,85
just looking for a fight,
drinking beer all the time.


14
0:0:55,85 --> 0:0:59,73
The brawler is a little drunk,
and he does something that


15
0:0:59,73 --> 0:1:5,33
pisses the girl off, and they
get into an argument.


16
0:1:5,33 --> 0:1:9,56
Next thing you know, we see
him dragging her sofa out.


17
0:1:9,56 --> 0:1:11,34
And they can't really
stop him.


18
0:1:11,34 --> 0:1:14,44
He's moving stuff and knocking
shit over, pulling out tables


19
0:1:14,44 --> 0:1:19,4
and chairs, and things
off the wall.


20
0:1:19,4 --> 0:1:21,566
And we're kind of in the
corner like why?


21
0:1:21,566 --> 0:1:22,82
Why is this happening?


22
0:1:22,82 --> 0:1:24,605
It's like, people are
holding her back.


23
0:1:24,605 --> 0:1:26,51
She's acting like she
wants to attack him.


24
0:1:26,51 --> 0:1:29,35
So next thing you know, the
girl's entire apartment is


25
0:1:29,35 --> 0:1:31,19
sitting out in the hallway.


26
0:1:31,19 --> 0:1:34,5
He's got this little smirk on
his face, and the girl is


27
0:1:34,5 --> 0:1:35,61
going crazy.


28
0:1:35,61 --> 0:1:39,12
She just grabs a chair and
clocks the brawler.


29
0:1:39,12 --> 0:1:40,71
We got a few laughs.


30
0:1:40,71 --> 0:1:43,7
She never threw a party
out there again.


31
0:1:43,7 --> 0:1:47,29
Actually, I think she
moved after that.


32
0:1:47,29 --> 0:1:50,44
And that was some crazy ass
shit from back in the days


33
0:1:50,44 --> 0:1:51,69
around the way.


34
0:1:51,69 --> 0:3:51,69
