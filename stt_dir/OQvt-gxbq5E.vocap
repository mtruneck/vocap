###43 ARTHUR BOYT: Well not all my neighbors know what I am.
###49 Yes, I have a bad reputation for eating roadkill.
###53 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###66 ARTHUR BOYT: Here we are at the gateway to our property.
###72 It is Butterwell farm.
###75 We had a badger come across here.
###79 Ran across here, and over there.
###81 Every night he was coming down.
###82 And one night, coming up, I very nearly ran him over.
###86 Just caught sight of him about to go under the wheel.
###88 
###92 Yes.
###93 Yes, I've hit at least one pheasant and one rabbit.
###102 But I would do my utmost to avoid killing anything.
###106 
###110 This is a polecat ferret.
###114 I found it not a mile away from here.
###116 And it, as you see, has been thoroughly
###119 rolled out on the road.
###121 They stink.
###123 The flesh smells.
###125 But you can overcome that by putting the body into running
###134 water for four days.
###136 And that will remove that musky tang from the meat.
###144 But yes, you could eat it.
###146 You'd have to be pretty hard up to want to eat a polecat.
###150 
###154 I live here on [INAUDIBLE]
###155 with my wife.
###158 And with a cat.
###161 I'm often asked, how did this all begin?
###165 After 1976, when I was living on my own, I didn't have to
###172 bother and with anybody else's feelings in the matter.
###176 The food was there to be brought home and eaten.
###182 I would pick up roadkill in those days to
###186 bring home and mount.
###188 I am a taxidermist.
###190 So I'd skin things, and then stuff.
###194 And instead of throwing the body away, I decided to start
###200 eating them.
###203 I think that's how it came about on a regular basis.
###209 I'm pretty sure I'd eaten badger
###210 before that, and a swan.
###214 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###224 ARTHUR BOYT: Right here is the famous freezer.
###227 
###231 A young hedgehog.
###234 A barn owl that was nearby.
###237 An antler there, and an antler there.
###240 This is a lovely bird.
###242 That's a snipe.
###244 I picked that up in Devon.
###245 I don't know what this fellow is.
###248 He's a reptile.
###249 Here's a sparrowhawk that flew into the window.
###252 In fact, I've got three sparrowhawks here.
###255 Badger, cat, 2008.
###261 Hind legs of a cat.
###263 Butchered, ready to eat.
###265 And a buzzard.
###268 I have occasionally hit an animal myself, by accident.
###273 But I never aim to kill an animal.
###276 I do my utmost to avoid it.
###278 I come across it in my regular or irregular journeys in and
###286 out of Cornwall.
###287 Badger, Camel Valley, April, 2001.
###294 Here's the heart, the kidneys, and, ah yes, the testes and
###301 his willie.
###303 Now the badger has a bone in its willie called the baculum.
###310 And I've got quite a few of those.
###312 
###315 You can eat the penis, yes.
###318 It's not particularly tasty.
###320 But I'd imagine a bit like in the Arab world the horse penis
###327 is quite a delicacy.
###329 But I wouldn't say it's anything to write home about.
###333 This is it the badger's head.
###335 This is my favorite, because you've got
###337 the big muscles here.
###339 And you've got the salivary glands.
###342 You've got the tongue.
###343 You've got the eyeballs, very essential for good sight.
###347 And then you've got the brain.
###348 So you've got one, two, three, four, five different tastes
###355 and textures in one saucepan.
###359 They all taste different, feel different.
###362 
###369 Here we are.
###371 Where do I find--
###374 price range, $180 to $680.
###376 [PHONE RINGING]
###377 ARTHUR BOYT: Hello.
###380 It's reasonably undamaged?
###383 Yes, I know.
###384 I've got it.
###386 OK, we've got a badger.
###389 We'll go along and see if I can find that.
###394 Good.
###395 I don't eat everything I find.
###397 But there's nothing in this country that I wouldn't eat.
###401 I've eaten a couple of bats.
###403 
###405 Not a lot there, I must confess.
###407 
###409 I've got the key.
###413 -Would you ever eat your own cat?
###415 
###418 ARTHUR BOYT: Where has she gone?
###420 There she is.
###422 There she is.
###423 
###427 We had a cat that died.
###430 And he's buried up there.
###433 I didn't eat it.
###434 
###439 If my wife found out, what would I say?
###441 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###448 ARTHUR BOYT: 1982, I cycled across America, from New
###454 Orleans to Winnipeg.
###457 And I found a lot of roadkill, of course on the way.
###461 On one occasion I stopped near Kansas City.
###465 There was this brilliant scarlet bird
###468 lying in the gutter.
###470 And I stopped and picked it up.
###471 And as I did so, a car drew up beside me.
###474 And it was a police car.
###475 And he wound down the window down.
###477 And he said, do you mind stepping off the highway
###480 before you get killed?
###481 
###484 So that was rather nice.
###486 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###499 ARTHUR BOYT: This looks like fresh badger.
###503 Let's have a look at it, and see what condition it's in.
###507 It's not too bad.
###509 It's not been squashed.
###510 Yeah.
###512 
###515 It may have been here a little while, but it doesn't look
###519 rotten yet.
###521 
###524 It's jaw is dislocated.
###529 I would say it's been for probably at least a month.
###534 But it's been very cold weather.
###536 So it has kept.
###538 Yeah, it's edible, I reckon.
###543 
###549 I have never been ill from eating roadkill.
###552 I've been ill from eating food supplied at
###556 a buffet, for instance.
###558 But I've never been ill, ever, eating roadkill.
###561 If it's well cooked, I think there's very little chance of
###566 any bugs, bacteria surviving.
###569 
###573 Well, we'll take it back and see if it's OK.
###578 And then skin it, cut it up, and eat it.
###583 
###595 It's a lady badger.
###596 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###614 ARTHUR BOYT: I certainly think there is a lot to be said
###618 against eating meat that involves animals being killed
###622 on my behalf.
###624 For animals to be killed so that I can eat them, and chuck
###628 away what I don't fancy is a terrible thing.
###632 
###636 You see people in a restaurant that leave
###640 no end of meat uneaten.
###642 Well that animal has died in vain, in a way, you can say.
###645 
###655 Shall we put it like that?
###659 Every joint of meat you eat has been hacked
###661 from a body like this.
###664 You never think of that when you tuck into a
###665 beef burger, do you?
###669 Got the knife in, but as you see, with an intact skull you
###674 can get a bit of leverage on it.
###677 Nice crunchy noises.
###678 
###681 There's the heart.
###682 
###685 OK, that's all we want from this.
###688 I'm going to leave the neck.
###692 This I shall put out for the crows and the ravens and the
###695 buzzards and the foxes.
###697 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###707 ARTHUR BOYT: The reason I started eating roadkill
###709 regularly was because I was on my own.
###714 My wife had been made to leave me.
###718 She'd be made to leave me by the religious
###723 sect to which I belonged.
###725 This is me in the days when I was young and handsome.
###729 Do you want it under the light?
###733 I'm sitting on my bed in my aunt's house.
###736 And I'm reading my Bible.
###738 I was a member of the Exclusive Brethren.
###742 I used to preach in the street, three
###744 times a week or more.
###747 
###750 Until I was 36, when they kicked me out for questioning
###759 the administration.
###760 
###762 They wanted to stop us from interpreting prayers for the
###768 deaf people in the community.
###772 And I questioned it.
###775 I have a twin brother.
###777 When I got kicked out, he had no more to do with me.
###782 And they made my wife leave me.
###785 It's unthinkable.
###786 
###790 So I got a divorce.
###792 And have since happily remarried.
###797 But I now do not believe in the existence of God.
###802 
###812 I suppose that eating road kill is a new adventure.
###817 And when you first go to eat something that isn't supplied
###823 by the butcher, you've got to cross a threshold.
###829 You are going into unknown territory.
###832 
###835 All I'm doing here is just sealing the meat.
###840 And that is well charged with onion and garlic.
###848 I eat a badger once that someone else had picked up and
###853 put on one side.
###854 Because they wanted it's skull.
###856 It was blown up like a horse on the Western Front.
###863 And it smelled rather horrible.
###866 When I cut into it, the flesh was green.
###870 But nevertheless, I persevered.
###873 And stewed it.
###875 It made the house smell like the old fashioned mental
###881 hospitals used to.
###883 But boy, it tasted delicious.
###885 
###889 Well that's the casserole in the oven.
###893 And to be well cooked it wants to be in there for three and a
###899 half hours.
###900 Then we'll see how it goes.
###903 
###918 Cannibalism, it's a tricky question.
###922 
###926 I don't think it for me to make comments about other
###928 people being cannibals.
###931 But if I were in a situation where there was human flesh
###936 available, and it might sustain me or others with me,
###943 I would have no compunction about eating it.
###948 
###950 All right?
###953 Allow me to introduce you to Mister Jonathan King, and his
###958 son, Peter King.
###960 He happens to be the brother of my good wife.
###965 I knew someone who worked in a hospital lab who could have
###970 got a human leg for me.
###972 But I decided that fun though it might be, it would be
###978 irresistible to tell somebody I'd done it.
###981 And once I told them, I would be branded
###984 forever as a cannibal.
###986 Who knows what that might result in.
###988 
###993 -Badger.
###994 ARTHUR BOYT: This way, this way, this way.
###998 Here we are.
###999 
###1003 The skull, meat slipping off it.
###1006 Look at that, nicely cooked.
###1008 
###1012 Here we have a casserole, badger's head.
###1016 Boyt specialty.
###1017 
###1019 This is very tender.
###1021 
###1025 Mm.
###1027 I should be in at the brains in a moment.
###1031 I think the brains have all bubbled out, actually.
###1034 The have a tendency to do that.
###1037 They're not where they originated.
###1040 -How about a tongue?
###1041 Can you pull the tongue out?
###1043 ARTHUR BOYT: Yeah, I can pull the tongue out.
###1045 Here is the tongue.
###1048 Do you see the tongue there?
###1049 
###1053 There's the tongue.
###1055 See that?
###1056 Lovely, badger tongue.
###1057 
###1070 Mm.
###1071 [LATIN TRUMPET MUSIC PLAYING]
###1095 ARTHUR BOYT: Peter, to the badger.
###1098 PETER KING: To the badger.
###1098 Thank you.
###1099 ARTHUR BOYT: A misses badger, it was, a badger sow.
###1105 PETER KING: It's not bad, actually.
