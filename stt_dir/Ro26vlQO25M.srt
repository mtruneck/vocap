CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: What is it like to
have your life uprooted by a natural disaster?


2
0:0:4,7 --> 0:0:9,48
Today, we are sharing the story of one young
victim and his family. I`m Carl Azuz, this


3
0:0:9,48 --> 0:0:24,1
is CNN STUDENT NEWS.


4
0:0:24,1 --> 0:0:28,59
We start with a search for hundreds of missing
people. They haven`t been seen since the typhoon


5
0:0:28,59 --> 0:0:34,1
hit their home country last week. Typhoons
are the same kinds of storms as hurricanes,


6
0:0:34,1 --> 0:0:38,96
and Typhoon Bopha was the strongest one that
hit the Philippines this year. You can see


7
0:0:38,96 --> 0:0:43,12
some of the damage that it left behind in
this "I-Report" video. The storm`s heavy rains


8
0:0:43,12 --> 0:0:48,699
led the flash floods and landslides, more
than 600 people were killed in this, and almost


9
0:0:48,699 --> 0:0:55,89
1500 others were injured. More than 700 people
are missing including more than 300 Filipino


10
0:0:55,89 --> 0:0:59,489
fishermen. Search efforts are underway, relief
groups are trying to get supplies to some


11
0:0:59,489 --> 0:1:3,499
of the areas that were hit the worst, but
it`s difficult, because of damage to roads


12
0:1:3,499 --> 0:1:5,229
and communication lines.


13
0:1:5,229 --> 0:1:11,22
Next, we are looking at the civil war in Syria.
It`s been going on for almost two years now


14
0:1:11,22 --> 0:1:16,23
with Syrian government forces fighting against
rebel groups. And official who`s represented


15
0:1:16,23 --> 0:1:21,3
the United Nations in the Arab League says
the solution is possible, but he also described


16
0:1:21,3 --> 0:1:26,32
the situation in Syria as bad and getting
worse. Some of the violence is happening in


17
0:1:26,32 --> 0:1:31,2
the city of Aleppo. And this Youtube video
shows the fire in the city`s old market earlier


18
0:1:31,2 --> 0:1:36,9
this year. The old section of Aleppo is a
world heritage site, it`s full of historical


19
0:1:36,9 --> 0:1:41,18
and cultural significance. Arwa Damon explores
how it`s been effected by the civil war.


20
0:1:41,18 --> 0:1:42,27
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


21
0:1:42,27 --> 0:1:48,7
ARWA DAMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Aleppo`s old
city has not seen such devastation since occupied


22
0:1:48,7 --> 0:1:52,92
by the Mongol invaders eight centuries ago.


23
0:1:52,92 --> 0:2:0,36
This mosque, for example, dates back to 1315.
This is Syria`s rich cultural heritage, and


24
0:2:0,36 --> 0:2:7,2
now everywhere we look, it`s been scarred
by war. Once bustling winding streets, now


25
0:2:7,2 --> 0:2:9,369
a maze of ever shifting front lines.


26
0:2:9,369 --> 0:2:19,799
Overhead, the thundering of fighter jets,
a small khan, lodging for caravans down the


27
0:2:19,799 --> 0:2:27,959
ages, lies in ruins. For more than three millennia,
Aleppo has been a crossroads for traders.


28
0:2:27,959 --> 0:2:35,29
We hurry through the courtyard of a traditional
home.


29
0:2:35,29 --> 0:2:43,239
Sheets are strung across streets to block
snipers line of sight. Those who dare venture


30
0:2:43,239 --> 0:2:49,9
quickly across. A unit of fighters records
people`s names and license plates, only those


31
0:2:49,9 --> 0:2:52,48
who have shops here are allowed through.


32
0:2:52,48 --> 0:2:58,49
Abu Bashir says, they`re trying to clamp down
on robberies.


33
0:2:58,49 --> 0:2:59,639
(woman talking Arabic)


34
0:2:59,639 --> 0:3:6,23
DAMON: She shows us the list, the highlighted
names have cleared out all their possessions.


35
0:3:6,23 --> 0:3:13,239
In one market, a shop recently hit by army
fire, still smolders. The heart of old Aleppo,


36
0:3:13,239 --> 0:3:18,639
now the historic battleground for the very
uncertain future of Syria.


37
0:3:18,639 --> 0:3:19,4
(END VIDEOTAPE)


38
0:3:19,4 --> 0:3:20,54
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


39
0:3:20,54 --> 0:3:25,169
REP. JERROLD NADLER, NEW YORK: Although the
emergency response agencies work hard to get


40
0:3:25,169 --> 0:3:29,4
the city back up and running, there were gaps
in the recovery operations and there are many


41
0:3:29,4 --> 0:3:34,409
challenges that remain, particularly for a
dense urban area like New York. Our transportation


42
0:3:34,409 --> 0:3:39,319
system is too vulnerable, our infrastructure
is old and hard to replace. The power grid


43
0:3:39,319 --> 0:3:43,889
runs more than just lights and computers,
it also powers heat and hot water and all


44
0:3:43,889 --> 0:3:48,219
water in the high-rises all over the city.
And that operates the elevators that the elderly


45
0:3:48,219 --> 0:3:52,749
and disabled rely upon to escape their homes
when they become unsafe.


46
0:3:52,749 --> 0:3:55,829
(END VIDEO CLIP)


47
0:3:55,829 --> 0:4:1,18
AZUZ: President Obama is asking Congress for
more than $60 billion to help the states that


48
0:4:1,18 --> 0:4:5,449
have been effected by Superstorm Sandy. Now,
that money is not going to cover all of the


49
0:4:5,449 --> 0:4:10,459
estimated damage from the storm, it would
be used for recovery and the prepare for future


50
0:4:10,459 --> 0:4:15,48
natural disasters. Ryan Panetta and his family
are going through that recovery process right


51
0:4:15,48 --> 0:4:20,57
now. Every day Ryan gets up and goes to school,
after classes he rides the bus to his house,


52
0:4:20,57 --> 0:4:25,97
and all that sounds normal, but for Ryan and
his family, life is nothing like it was before


53
0:4:25,97 --> 0:4:26,38
the storm.


54
0:4:26,38 --> 0:4:26,97
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


55
0:4:26,97 --> 0:4:30,84
POPPY HARLOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The sun isn`t
up at breakfast time for the Panettas.


56
0:4:30,84 --> 0:4:34,2
(on camera): How tired are you?


57
0:4:34,2 --> 0:4:34,29
RYAN PANETTA, 8TH GRADER, SCHOLARS ACADEMY:
Very.


58
0:4:34,29 --> 0:4:37,57
HARLOW (voice over): Tim, Ryan, Christian
and Carly are now living in a borrowed one-bedroom


59
0:4:37,57 --> 0:4:38,94
apartment with their parents.


60
0:4:38,94 --> 0:4:41,42
(on camera): How long is your commute to a
school now?


61
0:4:41,42 --> 0:4:43,8
PANETTA: It feels almost like two hours.


62
0:4:43,8 --> 0:4:47,3
HARLOW: And what did it use to be?


63
0:4:47,3 --> 0:4:48,79
RYAN PANETTA: 15 minutes.


64
0:4:48,79 --> 0:4:49,67
HARLOW: Wow.


65
0:4:49,67 --> 0:4:55,4
(voice over): 6:30 a.m and they are out the
door. A long car ride ...


66
0:4:55,4 --> 0:4:56,74
KAREN PANETTA, RYAN`S MOTHER: Have a good
day.


67
0:4:56,74 --> 0:5:0,16
HARLOW: Then a bus to Ryan`s temporary school,
PS-13.


68
0:5:0,16 --> 0:5:5,0
KAREN PANETTA: It`s unreal how much our life
has changed. You know, and we are trying to


69
0:5:5,0 --> 0:5:5,99
make the best of it.


70
0:5:5,99 --> 0:5:11,34
HARLOW: He is an 8th grade honor student,
one of 5400 New York students still in different


71
0:5:11,34 --> 0:5:12,49
schools because of Sandy.


72
0:5:12,49 --> 0:5:14,86
CARRIE JAMES, SCHOLAR`S ACADEMY HUMANITIES
TEACHER: He is the one that I think was probably


73
0:5:14,86 --> 0:5:19,33
impacted the most, and yet he has the strongest
will to be here every day.


74
0:5:19,33 --> 0:5:23,66
RYAN PANETTA: When something brings you down,
you`ve got to get up.


75
0:5:23,66 --> 0:5:27,32
HARLOW (on camera): You are OK, buddy?


76
0:5:27,32 --> 0:5:29,21
What makes you sad?


77
0:5:29,21 --> 0:5:32,73
RYAN PANETTA: I honestly don`t know.


78
0:5:32,73 --> 0:5:33,9
HARLOW: Everything?


79
0:5:33,9 --> 0:5:36,25
RYAN PANETTA: It`s everything.


80
0:5:36,25 --> 0:5:40,94
KAREN PANETTA: How did it go today, Ryan?


81
0:5:40,94 --> 0:5:42,7
RYAN PANETTA: Good.


82
0:5:42,7 --> 0:5:49,34
HARLOW (VOICE OVER): Every day after school
Ryan returns to Broad Channel to help his


83
0:5:49,34 --> 0:5:51,37
dad try to put their home back together.


84
0:5:51,37 --> 0:5:55,66
JOE PANETTA, RYAN`S FATHER: Everything that
I owned, everything I worked hard for everything


85
0:5:55,66 --> 0:5:57,41
was there, and it`s gone, it`s nothing.


86
0:5:57,41 --> 0:6:1,98
HARLOW: Joe was working overnights, and Karen
was home with their four children when Sandy


87
0:6:1,98 --> 0:6:2,17
hit.


88
0:6:2,17 --> 0:6:4,58
KAREN PANETTA: It was unbelievable, though,
how quickly it came in.


89
0:6:4,58 --> 0:6:9,69
HARLOW: The water rushed into their one-story
house, Ryan swam to neighbor for help.


90
0:6:9,69 --> 0:6:10,5
RYAN PANETTA: I jumped out.


91
0:6:10,5 --> 0:6:12,23
HARLOW (on camera): You jumped out here in
the water?


92
0:6:12,23 --> 0:6:15,44
RYAN PANETTA: Yes. I wasn`t even thinking
that like a log would hit me or anything.


93
0:6:15,44 --> 0:6:16,88
HARLOW: Or the electrical power lines?


94
0:6:16,88 --> 0:6:17,35
RYAN PANETTA: Yes.


95
0:6:17,35 --> 0:6:18,52
HARLOW: You swam to this house?


96
0:6:18,52 --> 0:6:22,64
RYAN PANETTA: Yeah, it`s right here. And they
took us in to the second floor.


97
0:6:22,64 --> 0:6:26,27
HARLOW (voice over): The neighbor helped bring
the rest of the family over, and they watched


98
0:6:26,27 --> 0:6:28,99
as the water engulfed the only home they`ve
known.


99
0:6:28,99 --> 0:6:32,2
(on camera): What did you think when your
13-old son jumped in the water?


100
0:6:32,2 --> 0:6:35,84
KAREN PANETTA: You know, I was panicking.
I was panicking.


101
0:6:35,84 --> 0:6:37,37
HARLOW: Did Ryan helped save your family?


102
0:6:37,37 --> 0:6:38,15
KAREN PANETTA: Absolutely.


103
0:6:38,15 --> 0:6:38,93
HARLOW: No question?


104
0:6:38,93 --> 0:6:39,71
KAREN PANETTA: Absolutely.


105
0:6:39,71 --> 0:6:44,21
HARLOW (voice over): Now, all the Panettas
are working to rebuild their home and erase


106
0:6:44,21 --> 0:6:45,2
the bad memories.


107
0:6:45,2 --> 0:6:51,47
RYAN PANETTA: After what I`ve just been through
like I don`t hope I have to see anything that


108
0:6:51,47 --> 0:6:52,62
terrifying again.


109
0:6:52,62 --> 0:6:55,63

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See, if you can I.D.
me.


113
0:7:1,25 --> 0:7:7,27
I`m a planet in our Solar System. I`m not
one of the gas giants, but I am the largest


114
0:7:7,27 --> 0:7:12,68
of the terrestrial or rocky planets. I`m the
only planet whose name doesn`t come from Greek


115
0:7:12,68 --> 0:7:15,22
or Roman mythology.


116
0:7:15,22 --> 0:7:22,29
I`m Earth, the fifth largest planet in the
Solar System.

0:7:22,29 --> 0:7:24,2
(END VIDEO CLIP)


118
0:7:24,2 --> 0:7:28,4
AZUZ: You`ve seen a lot of pictures of the
Earth, most of the time they are taken during


119
0:7:28,4 --> 0:7:32,51
the day because we have a lot of satellites
that can do that for us. There is a new sensor


120
0:7:32,51 --> 0:7:36,73
on a satellite that was launched last year,
that`s especially designed to observe the


121
0:7:36,73 --> 0:7:41,75
Earth at night. Scientists say these cloud
free images are from more detailed view of


122
0:7:41,75 --> 0:7:47,26
our planet than ever before. What`s really
interesting are the lights, and how they sort


123
0:7:47,26 --> 0:7:52,58
of define our world. For example, this is
Egypt, and that long line is the Nile River,


124
0:7:52,58 --> 0:7:56,8
the satellite can distinguish the brightly
lit boats traveling along it. Some of the


125
0:7:56,8 --> 0:8:1,57
lights around the Arabian Peninsula are gas
flares from oil exploration, and this border


126
0:8:1,57 --> 0:8:5,91
between light and dark is marked by the Himalayan
Mountains, an example of how natural borders


127
0:8:5,91 --> 0:8:11,16
can effect human settlement. You can see political
borders, too. The lights here in South Korea,


128
0:8:11,16 --> 0:8:13,6
the darkness is North Korea.


129
0:8:13,6 --> 0:8:17,87
There are some new officers on patrol in metro
stations around Washington, and they come


130
0:8:17,87 --> 0:8:23,7
equipped with a unique skill set: it all starts
with their noses, these bomb-sniffing dogs


131
0:8:23,7 --> 0:8:28,31
worked with the Marine Corps in Afghanistan.
They were recently donated to the Metro Transit


132
0:8:28,31 --> 0:8:31,33
Police. Their new handlers are impressed by
their pedigree.


133
0:8:31,33 --> 0:8:31,75
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


134
0:8:31,75 --> 0:8:35,0
SGT. ANDY KEAHON, METRO TRANSIT POLICE DEPARTMENT:
Every single one of the nine dogs that we


135
0:8:35,0 --> 0:8:38,8
receive from the Marine Corps found bombs
in Afghanistan. We have one in particular


136
0:8:38,8 --> 0:8:43,21
that found 37 improvised explosive devises
that were all buried down the road. We had


137
0:8:43,21 --> 0:8:46,57
no idea that these dogs where as good they
are, and they are fantastic.


138
0:8:46,57 --> 0:8:47,11
(END VIDEOTAPE)


139
0:8:47,11 --> 0:8:51,11
AZUZ: And good looking, too. Now, we did a
dog story. So, before we go, in order to be


140
0:8:51,11 --> 0:8:55,75
fair we are going to finish up with felines.
This little guy is down for a catnap. But


141
0:8:55,75 --> 0:9:0,49
something seems to have spooked him, look
at those poor paws, flailing. Leave it to


142
0:9:0,49 --> 0:9:6,1
mom to know just what to do: you brush down
the arms and come in for a quick kitty cuddle.


143
0:9:6,1 --> 0:9:11,31
A classic move seems to do the trick, and
now you know the secret. If your pet is suffering


144
0:9:11,31 --> 0:9:16,31
from nightmares, a simple hug will take care
of the whole kitten caboodle. Without any


145
0:9:16,31 --> 0:9:20,81
fears of further catastrophe. CNN STUDENT
NEWS returns tomorrow. I hope to see you then,


146
0:9:20,81 --> 0:11:20,81
bye-bye.
