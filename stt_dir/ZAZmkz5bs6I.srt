1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:1,65



2
0:0:1,65 --> 0:0:2,52
DOUG HODOUS: We are going to
pour this right in here and


3
0:0:2,52 --> 0:0:3,25
look at this.


4
0:0:3,25 --> 0:0:4,46
STEVE SPANGLER: Ah, wow.


5
0:0:4,46 --> 0:0:6,51
DOUG HODOUS: Look at this,
it's like magic.


6
0:0:6,51 --> 0:0:8,1
BECKY DITCHFIELD: I have no idea
what's going to happen.


7
0:0:8,1 --> 0:0:9,64
STEVE SPANGLER: This is
a biological stain.


8
0:0:9,64 --> 0:0:10,28
CARLY REED: Oh no.


9
0:0:10,28 --> 0:0:11,28
STEVE SPANGLER: This
is just- It's fine.


10
0:0:11,28 --> 0:0:14,29
This is- So I bet you think this
is the part of this show,


11
0:0:14,29 --> 0:0:17,3
where I'm going to say, don't
try these experiments at home.


12
0:0:17,3 --> 0:0:18,21
And you're right.


13
0:0:18,21 --> 0:0:20,65
Except there is one experiment
we want you to try.


14
0:0:20,65 --> 0:0:22,38
Just look for the graphic
that's right here


15
0:0:22,38 --> 0:0:23,31
that says, try it.


16
0:0:23,31 --> 0:0:25,26
That's your signal that
you can try that


17
0:0:25,26 --> 0:0:26,29
experiment at home.


18
0:0:26,29 --> 0:0:27,87
Everything else, off limits.


19
0:0:27,87 --> 0:0:29,972
Look, I've already given you
homework, and the show hasn't


20
0:0:29,972 --> 0:0:31,67
even started.


21
0:0:31,67 --> 0:0:34,89
I'm Steve Spangler, and I'm all
about making science fun.


22
0:0:34,89 --> 0:0:37,77
For the last 20 years I've been
teaching ways to turn


23
0:0:37,77 --> 0:0:40,78
ordinary science experiments
into unforgettable learning


24
0:0:40,78 --> 0:0:41,79
experiences.


25
0:0:41,79 --> 0:0:44,42
I have an amazing team, who will
do whatever it takes to


26
0:0:44,42 --> 0:0:47,17
affect the way people
think about science.


27
0:0:47,17 --> 0:0:50,87
And to do that I live by one
model- make it big, do it


28
0:0:50,87 --> 0:0:52,47
right, give it class.


29
0:0:52,47 --> 0:0:57,71



30
0:0:57,71 --> 0:0:59,98
You know, I think it's true, you
never actually forget the


31
0:0:59,98 --> 0:1:1,62
great teachers that you
had in your life.


32
0:1:1,62 --> 0:1:4,6
And when I go back and think
about my high school, Heritage


33
0:1:4,6 --> 0:1:6,48
High School and the Littleton
Public Schools,


34
0:1:6,48 --> 0:1:7,6
one guy sticks out.


35
0:1:7,6 --> 0:1:8,67
His name is Doug Hodous.


36
0:1:8,67 --> 0:1:11,11
And he was my very first
chemistry teacher.


37
0:1:11,11 --> 0:1:13,93
This is the guy that made things
blow up, and the funny


38
0:1:13,93 --> 0:1:15,2
smells, and so forth.


39
0:1:15,2 --> 0:1:18,1
And so I thought today we'd go
back to Heritage High School,


40
0:1:18,1 --> 0:1:20,53
and see if we can take him back
to his old class, and


41
0:1:20,53 --> 0:1:21,78
have a little lesson
in chemistry.


42
0:1:21,78 --> 0:1:25,5



43
0:1:25,5 --> 0:1:25,74
DOUG HODOUS: Hey, Steve.


44
0:1:25,74 --> 0:1:27,49
How are you?


45
0:1:27,49 --> 0:1:28,38
You're looking good.


46
0:1:28,38 --> 0:1:30,66
STEVE SPANGLER: So I walk in
and you're no longer here,


47
0:1:30,66 --> 0:1:32,89
because they kicked you
out 20 years ago.


48
0:1:32,89 --> 0:1:34,3
How long have you
been retired?


49
0:1:34,3 --> 0:1:35,74
DOUG HODOUS: It's been
a long, long time.


50
0:1:35,74 --> 0:1:37,92
1996.


51
0:1:37,92 --> 0:1:38,21
'97.


52
0:1:38,21 --> 0:1:38,745
STEVE SPANGLER: Look at this.


53
0:1:38,745 --> 0:1:40,86
My chemistry teacher,
he is here.


54
0:1:40,86 --> 0:1:43,17
He's the guy that they made
sure-- well there's a lot of


55
0:1:43,17 --> 0:1:45,74
stories about sneaking out, and
doing demos, and so forth.


56
0:1:45,74 --> 0:1:46,72
But I was going to ask you.


57
0:1:46,72 --> 0:1:48,8
Let's go back into
at the class.


58
0:1:48,8 --> 0:1:50,54
Let's see if we can rummage
around a little bit.


59
0:1:50,54 --> 0:1:51,82
And I'd love to have you do--


60
0:1:51,82 --> 0:1:52,6
I want disappearing ink.


61
0:1:52,6 --> 0:1:52,825
DOUG HODOUS: Oh.


62
0:1:52,825 --> 0:1:52,9
Excellent.


63
0:1:52,9 --> 0:1:53,49
STEVE SPANGLER: That's
what I want.


64
0:1:53,49 --> 0:1:55,9
I want your formula for
disappearing ink.


65
0:1:55,9 --> 0:1:57,85
DOUG HODOUS: Oh, that would
be a lot of fun.


66
0:1:57,85 --> 0:1:58,7
Thanks for inviting me.


67
0:1:58,7 --> 0:2:0,76
STEVE SPANGLER: Absolutely.


68
0:2:0,76 --> 0:2:2,37
Welcome back to your
old classroom.


69
0:2:2,37 --> 0:2:4,405
Some things don't
change, do they?


70
0:2:4,405 --> 0:2:5,68
DOUG HODOUS: Well--


71
0:2:5,68 --> 0:2:6,93
What do they call this, Steve?


72
0:2:6,93 --> 0:2:7,99
I used to a chalkboard.


73
0:2:7,99 --> 0:2:9,24
STEVE SPANGLER: It's
a dry erase board.


74
0:2:9,24 --> 0:2:10,919
And when you get older
you forget--


75
0:2:10,919 --> 0:2:12,5
there used to be chalk.


76
0:2:12,5 --> 0:2:15,44
There used to be some huge demos
that we would do here.


77
0:2:15,44 --> 0:2:19,7
And you would ask me to come up
with some of the demos that


78
0:2:19,7 --> 0:2:19,37
you would do.


79
0:2:19,37 --> 0:2:20,89
And so I got to be your
lab assistant.


80
0:2:20,89 --> 0:2:24,15
It's a pretty smart decision on
your part to make me your


81
0:2:24,15 --> 0:2:24,73
lab assistant, right?


82
0:2:24,73 --> 0:2:26,17
DOUG HODOUS: Well, if--


83
0:2:26,17 --> 0:2:28,74
the fact we know, when you were
in my AP chemistry class


84
0:2:28,74 --> 0:2:29,78
as a junior.


85
0:2:29,78 --> 0:2:32,78
And then I thought, because you
had passed and done well


86
0:2:32,78 --> 0:2:35,63
on the exam, I thought maybe
you would be an appropriate


87
0:2:35,63 --> 0:2:38,71
person for you and Todd, who
later on became a doctor, to


88
0:2:38,71 --> 0:2:40,2
be my lab assistants.


89
0:2:40,2 --> 0:2:40,89
Well, that was a mistake.


90
0:2:40,89 --> 0:2:41,555
STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah, it was.


91
0:2:41,555 --> 0:2:41,96
OK.


92
0:2:41,96 --> 0:2:43,23
So.


93
0:2:43,23 --> 0:2:44,87
But there were some pretty
good explosions.


94
0:2:44,87 --> 0:2:45,4
DOUG HODOUS: Oh, yeah.


95
0:2:45,4 --> 0:2:46,21
STEVE SPANGLER: There was
something very cool that you


96
0:2:46,21 --> 0:2:47,33
did with disappearing ink.


97
0:2:47,33 --> 0:2:49,25
And so what I'd like to do
is to go back in the lab.


98
0:2:49,25 --> 0:2:49,46
DOUG HODOUS: Oh yeah.


99
0:2:49,46 --> 0:2:50,71
STEVE SPANGLER: And show me
just your formula for


100
0:2:50,71 --> 0:2:51,33
disappearing ink.


101
0:2:51,33 --> 0:2:51,95
DOUG HODOUS: I'd love to.


102
0:2:51,95 --> 0:2:52,485
STEVE SPANGLER: All into this.


103
0:2:52,485 --> 0:2:53,58
DOUG HODOUS: It'd be great.


104
0:2:53,58 --> 0:2:54,37
Yeah, sure


105
0:2:54,37 --> 0:2:56,11
STEVE SPANGLER: Let's
go look at that.


106
0:2:56,11 --> 0:2:58,26
Look at this, you even
dressed the part.


107
0:2:58,26 --> 0:2:58,96
I love this.


108
0:2:58,96 --> 0:3:1,3
DOUG HODOUS: Yes, I your always
want to look like a


109
0:3:1,3 --> 0:3:1,92
professional.


110
0:3:1,92 --> 0:3:2,97
STEVE SPANGLER: And
I love this, too.


111
0:3:2,97 --> 0:3:5,23
Oh wait, you've got this.


112
0:3:5,23 --> 0:3:8,42
Look, and he's got his little
nerd protector right here.


113
0:3:8,42 --> 0:3:8,91
I love that.


114
0:3:8,91 --> 0:3:9,65
DOUG HODOUS: It won't
go in there.


115
0:3:9,65 --> 0:3:10,4
STEVE SPANGLER: It doesn't
even fit there.


116
0:3:10,4 --> 0:3:11,42
DOUG HODOUS: Yeah, that's why
I put it in the other po--


117
0:3:11,42 --> 0:3:12,6
STEVE SPANGLER: Some things
never change.


118
0:3:12,6 --> 0:3:12,32
I'm serious.


119
0:3:12,32 --> 0:3:13,26
DOUG HODOUS: Yeah,
that's right.


120
0:3:13,26 --> 0:3:14,12
STEVE SPANGLER: I'll set
this off to the side--


121
0:3:14,12 --> 0:3:14,78
DOUG HODOUS: I didn't
know I had--


122
0:3:14,78 --> 0:3:15,77
STEVE SPANGLER: --just in
case you don't need it.


123
0:3:15,77 --> 0:3:16,28
DOUG HODOUS: I probably
won't need it.


124
0:3:16,28 --> 0:3:17,99
STEVE SPANGLER: Well, I want
you to show me how to make


125
0:3:17,99 --> 0:3:20,0
disappearing ink, but it looks
like you have something else


126
0:3:20,0 --> 0:3:20,54
set up instead.


127
0:3:20,54 --> 0:3:20,88
DOUG HODOUS: Oh, yeah.


128
0:3:20,88 --> 0:3:23,27
I wanted to sort of give you
an example of how this


129
0:3:23,27 --> 0:3:25,72
particular acid-based reaction
is going to work.


130
0:3:25,72 --> 0:3:28,23
Now, if you look right here, I
just have a beaker of water.


131
0:3:28,23 --> 0:3:31,7
I'm going to put a little bit
of the sodium hydroxide.


132
0:3:31,7 --> 0:3:32,95
Now, this is just a one molar
solution, so we're going to


133
0:3:32,95 --> 0:3:34,52
just add a little bit in here.


134
0:3:34,52 --> 0:3:34,81
STEVE SPANGLER: OK.


135
0:3:34,81 --> 0:3:35,57
DOUG HODOUS: OK?


136
0:3:35,57 --> 0:3:37,76
And it turns out, that
will be colorless.


137
0:3:37,76 --> 0:3:38,21
STEVE SPANGLER: OK.


138
0:3:38,21 --> 0:3:39,8
DOUG HODOUS: Because
that's a base and


139
0:3:39,8 --> 0:3:40,315
water, and it's colorless.


140
0:3:40,315 --> 0:3:40,62
STEVE SPANGLER: OK.


141
0:3:40,62 --> 0:3:42,56
DOUG HODOUS: Now, what we're
going to add here is just a


142
0:3:42,56 --> 0:3:44,7
very few drops of this.


143
0:3:44,7 --> 0:3:45,65
And show everybody
what that is.


144
0:3:45,65 --> 0:3:47,27
STEVE SPANGLER: It's called
phenolphthalein.


145
0:3:47,27 --> 0:3:47,74
So--


146
0:3:47,74 --> 0:3:48,62
DOUG HODOUS: It's
an indicator.


147
0:3:48,62 --> 0:3:50,14
STEVE SPANGLER: It actually
starts, you said, as a powder.


148
0:3:50,14 --> 0:3:51,56
So we have the powder here.


149
0:3:51,56 --> 0:3:53,35
And so you said a couple
of drops of


150
0:3:53,35 --> 0:3:55,2
phenolphthalein in there.


151
0:3:55,2 --> 0:3:55,37
DOUG HODOUS: Right.


152
0:3:55,37 --> 0:3:56,52
STEVE SPANGLER: All right.


153
0:3:56,52 --> 0:3:56,75
DOUG HODOUS: OK.


154
0:3:56,75 --> 0:3:58,95
And when I held it up before,
you actually could not see the


155
0:3:58,95 --> 0:4:0,15
liquid, but it is in there.


156
0:4:0,15 --> 0:4:4,1
So when I add this over
here, it turns


157
0:4:4,1 --> 0:4:5,26
a pink color because--


158
0:4:5,26 --> 0:4:6,3
STEVE SPANGLER: So,
the solution has


159
0:4:6,3 --> 0:4:7,5
to be basic, right?


160
0:4:7,5 --> 0:4:8,86
DOUG HODOUS: This is now a
basic solution, because


161
0:4:8,86 --> 0:4:10,64
there's sodium hydroxide
in this.


162
0:4:10,64 --> 0:4:12,17
Now what we're going
to add to the other


163
0:4:12,17 --> 0:4:15,14
beaker is a little acid.


164
0:4:15,14 --> 0:4:18,13
And of course, we know that acid
and bases will neutralize


165
0:4:18,13 --> 0:4:18,48
each other.


166
0:4:18,48 --> 0:4:21,89
But we want to put a little
excess acid in there.


167
0:4:21,89 --> 0:4:21,74
STEVE SPANGLER: Got it.


168
0:4:21,74 --> 0:4:23,76
So it makes a little
hydrochloric acid.


169
0:4:23,76 --> 0:4:25,3
So we get one molar
hydrochloric acid.


170
0:4:25,3 --> 0:4:27,4
DOUG HODOUS: Right, one molar.


171
0:4:27,4 --> 0:4:29,5
And when I pour this into here,
of course it's going to


172
0:4:29,5 --> 0:4:31,38
go back to colorless again.


173
0:4:31,38 --> 0:4:32,335
This is magic.


174
0:4:32,335 --> 0:4:33,82
STEVE SPANGLER: All
right, so again.


175
0:4:33,82 --> 0:4:35,59
What does this have to do
with disappearing ink?


176
0:4:35,59 --> 0:4:37,3
DOUG HODOUS: Well, it's the
same kind of reaction.


177
0:4:37,3 --> 0:4:39,24
It's going to be an acid-base
reaction.


178
0:4:39,24 --> 0:4:40,42
And we're going to
use an indicator.


179
0:4:40,42 --> 0:4:41,25
But this time we'll--


180
0:4:41,25 --> 0:4:42,75
STEVE SPANGLER: But I
don't want pink ink.


181
0:4:42,75 --> 0:4:44,64
I really would like to
have that deep dark--


182
0:4:44,64 --> 0:4:45,82
DOUG HODOUS: Well,
every indicator


183
0:4:45,82 --> 0:4:47,32
has different colors.


184
0:4:47,32 --> 0:4:49,9
This is our indicator for
disappearing ink.


185
0:4:49,9 --> 0:4:50,94
You can see the name
right there.


186
0:4:50,94 --> 0:4:52,39
Thymolphthalein.


187
0:4:52,39 --> 0:4:53,61
STEVE SPANGLER: So
thymolphthalein, just like


188
0:4:53,61 --> 0:4:56,85
phenolphthalein, triggers about
the same pH, right in


189
0:4:56,85 --> 0:4:57,57
about the same range?


190
0:4:57,57 --> 0:4:58,95
DOUG HODOUS: Right
about neutral.


191
0:4:58,95 --> 0:4:59,15
STEVE SPANGLER: OK.


192
0:4:59,15 --> 0:5:0,15
So that's what we're going
to use to make the


193
0:5:0,15 --> 0:5:0,2
disappearing ink.


194
0:5:0,2 --> 0:5:1,55
DOUG HODOUS: That's exactly
what we're going to use to


195
0:5:1,55 --> 0:5:2,28
make the disappearing ink.


196
0:5:2,28 --> 0:5:3,852
DOUG HODOUS: Do you remember
the formula?


197
0:5:3,852 --> 0:5:4,86
DOUG HODOUS: Ah, no.


198
0:5:4,86 --> 0:5:5,505
Let's do it.


199
0:5:5,505 --> 0:5:6,49
STEVE SPANGLER: What
you mean no?


200
0:5:6,49 --> 0:5:7,41
You don't remember
the formula?


201
0:5:7,41 --> 0:5:8,535
DOUG HODOUS: I don't remember
this formula.


202
0:5:8,535 --> 0:5:10,43
STEVE SPANGLER: Do you remember
the formula to make


203
0:5:10,43 --> 0:5:10,58
disappearing--


204
0:5:10,58 --> 0:5:11,506
DOUG HODOUS: Yes, I remember.


205
0:5:11,506 --> 0:5:12,81
STEVE SPANGLER: This truly is--
do you know what's the


206
0:5:12,81 --> 0:5:14,17
greatest thing about
getting old?


207
0:5:14,17 --> 0:5:16,35
It's that you have new friends
every day that


208
0:5:16,35 --> 0:5:17,32
you didn't even know--


209
0:5:17,32 --> 0:5:18,69
DOUG HODOUS: Do you remember
the formula?


210
0:5:18,69 --> 0:5:19,1
No.


211
0:5:19,1 --> 0:5:19,29
C-H-A--


212
0:5:19,29 --> 0:5:22,72
STEVE SPANGLER: No, I want to
know the formula to make the


213
0:5:22,72 --> 0:5:24,9
disappearing ink.


214
0:5:24,9 --> 0:5:27,35
I just want a liter of
the disappearing ink.


215
0:5:27,35 --> 0:5:27,58
DOUG HODOUS: Yes, right.


216
0:5:27,58 --> 0:5:28,44
STEVE SPANGLER: This is
pretty much how the


217
0:5:28,44 --> 0:5:29,12
lectures went too.


218
0:5:29,12 --> 0:5:32,9
We went for about 45 minutes
on stuff that we


219
0:5:32,9 --> 0:5:33,69
really didn't want..


220
0:5:33,69 --> 0:5:35,51
And, all of a sudden, bam we've
got about three minutes


221
0:5:35,51 --> 0:5:35,8
[INTERPOSING VOICES].


222
0:5:35,8 --> 0:5:37,38
DOUG HODOUS: I think what we
should do, opposed to what you


223
0:5:37,38 --> 0:5:37,92
normally did.


224
0:5:37,92 --> 0:5:39,2
Let's clean out these
beakers, so we


225
0:5:39,2 --> 0:5:40,1
start with clean beakers.


226
0:5:40,1 --> 0:5:40,89
STEVE SPANGLER: OK,
Martha, here.


227
0:5:40,89 --> 0:5:42,31
Why don't you just set these
off to the side.


228
0:5:42,31 --> 0:5:43,38
Let's use this, OK?


229
0:5:43,38 --> 0:5:44,67
Ah, that's a new bea--


230
0:5:44,67 --> 0:5:45,94
Oh, we're going to do
it on big time.


231
0:5:45,94 --> 0:5:46,73
STEVE SPANGLER: Let's do it.


232
0:5:46,73 --> 0:5:47,32
DOUG HODOUS: OK.


233
0:5:47,32 --> 0:5:50,2
Now, what we're going to do is
just take about two grams of


234
0:5:50,2 --> 0:5:51,66
this would be appropriate.


235
0:5:51,66 --> 0:5:54,13
And I don't think you really
have to measure this exact.


236
0:5:54,13 --> 0:5:56,82
So if you just put a little bit
at the end of that little


237
0:5:56,82 --> 0:5:57,23
scooper there.


238
0:5:57,23 --> 0:5:59,22
Have you got some at the
end of that scooper?


239
0:5:59,22 --> 0:6:0,43
STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah,
absolutely.


240
0:6:0,43 --> 0:6:1,46
DOUG HODOUS: Oh, perfect.


241
0:6:1,46 --> 0:6:1,68
Yeah.


242
0:6:1,68 --> 0:6:2,28
That's about right.


243
0:6:2,28 --> 0:6:4,19
A little bit at the end
of the tip of the


244
0:6:4,19 --> 0:6:5,29
spatula right there.


245
0:6:5,29 --> 0:6:6,2
STEVE SPANGLER: OK.


246
0:6:6,2 --> 0:6:6,59
DOUG HODOUS: All right.


247
0:6:6,59 --> 0:6:9,13
Now, what we need to do is
add a little ethanol.


248
0:6:9,13 --> 0:6:10,27
STEVE SPANGLER: OK.


249
0:6:10,27 --> 0:6:13,65
DOUG HODOUS: And so the ethanol
will help it dissolve.


250
0:6:13,65 --> 0:6:15,55
We'll get this milky
white color.


251
0:6:15,55 --> 0:6:17,61
And we'll swirl it around trying
to get it to dissolve


252
0:6:17,61 --> 0:6:19,39
as much as possible.


253
0:6:19,39 --> 0:6:20,84
STEVE SPANGLER: And then,
you dilute the rest


254
0:6:20,84 --> 0:6:21,895
of that with what?


255
0:6:21,895 --> 0:6:24,0
DOUG HODOUS: Ah, We'll dilute it
with water, and then we're


256
0:6:24,0 --> 0:6:25,52
going to add a little bit
of sodium hydroxide.


257
0:6:25,52 --> 0:6:26,33
STEVE SPANGLER: Got it.


258
0:6:26,33 --> 0:6:27,46
DOUG HODOUS: We're going
to make it basic.


259
0:6:27,46 --> 0:6:29,95
And the basic color is
going to be blue.


260
0:6:29,95 --> 0:6:31,275
STEVE SPANGLER: All right, so
let's add some of the water.


261
0:6:31,275 --> 0:6:32,993
DOUG HODOUS: OK,
let's do that.


262
0:6:32,993 --> 0:6:36,22



263
0:6:36,22 --> 0:6:37,98
STEVE SPANGLER: I see what you
say, I mean about it being


264
0:6:37,98 --> 0:6:38,73
that milky white.


265
0:6:38,73 --> 0:6:40,55
But nobody's going to see it,
because it's finally going to


266
0:6:40,55 --> 0:6:41,57
turn blue, right?


267
0:6:41,57 --> 0:6:42,5
DOUG HODOUS: Right.


268
0:6:42,5 --> 0:6:42,81
STEVE SPANGLER: OK.


269
0:6:42,81 --> 0:6:44,3
DOUG HODOUS: OK, now we're just
going to add a little bit


270
0:6:44,3 --> 0:6:45,29
of sodium hydroxide.


271
0:6:45,29 --> 0:6:46,92
That's going to turn it basic.


272
0:6:46,92 --> 0:6:48,6
STEVE SPANGLER: You don't
want too much.


273
0:6:48,6 --> 0:6:48,62
DOUG HODOUS: No, no, no.


274
0:6:48,62 --> 0:6:52,0
This is just a one molar
solution, dilute solution of


275
0:6:52,0 --> 0:6:53,42
sodium hydroxide.


276
0:6:53,42 --> 0:6:54,39
Now it's basic.


277
0:6:54,39 --> 0:6:55,95
STEVE SPANGLER: If I remember
it correctly, we've got to


278
0:6:55,95 --> 0:6:57,75
play with this a little bit,
because when we squirt it out


279
0:6:57,75 --> 0:7:0,27
onto the shirt, you've got to
see what amount disappears.


280
0:7:0,27 --> 0:7:0,54
DOUG HODOUS: Absolutely.


281
0:7:0,54 --> 0:7:1,86
You sort of do a trial.


282
0:7:1,86 --> 0:7:4,26
And you squirt it out, you
see how long it lasts.


283
0:7:4,26 --> 0:7:7,72
You want the blue to last, well,
maybe 10-20 seconds.


284
0:7:7,72 --> 0:7:8,0
STEVE SPANGLER: OK.


285
0:7:8,0 --> 0:7:9,22
So we don't need this
big solution.


286
0:7:9,22 --> 0:7:11,59
I'll pour a small amount into
this beaker, and we're set.


287
0:7:11,59 --> 0:7:14,43
DOUG HODOUS: Go ahead, let's
put some of this in.


288
0:7:14,43 --> 0:7:16,23
All right, so now
this is here.


289
0:7:16,23 --> 0:7:17,23
STEVE SPANGLER: Ah,
it looks great.


290
0:7:17,23 --> 0:7:18,19
DOUG HODOUS: That's
a perfect color.


291
0:7:18,19 --> 0:7:18,42
STEVE SPANGLER: OK.


292
0:7:18,42 --> 0:7:19,783
DOUG HODOUS: OK, let's
just look at it, and


293
0:7:19,783 --> 0:7:21,3
see how long it lasts.


294
0:7:21,3 --> 0:7:22,57
STEVE SPANGLER: So it's
changing back.


295
0:7:22,57 --> 0:7:24,74
We didn't put an acid on it,
so why is it changing back?


296
0:7:24,74 --> 0:7:26,89
DOUG HODOUS: Well, that's
because there's carbon dioxide


297
0:7:26,89 --> 0:7:27,41
in the air.


298
0:7:27,41 --> 0:7:29,83
And carbon dioxide and water,
and there's a lot of water


299
0:7:29,83 --> 0:7:31,8
here, is slightly acidic.


300
0:7:31,8 --> 0:7:33,35
In fact, if you'll just
blow on that.


301
0:7:33,35 --> 0:7:33,832
STEVE SPANGLER: OK.


302
0:7:33,832 --> 0:7:35,82
DOUG HODOUS: OK.


303
0:7:35,82 --> 0:7:37,21



304
0:7:37,21 --> 0:7:38,97
STEVE SPANGLER: It will actually
be a lot easier if


305
0:7:38,97 --> 0:7:41,41
you just spilled hydrochloric
acid on somebody and it would


306
0:7:41,41 --> 0:7:42,597
change back really fast,
but I guess that's


307
0:7:42,597 --> 0:7:42,72
not what you want.


308
0:7:42,72 --> 0:7:44,9
DOUG HODOUS: But that's going
to ruin the shirt, isn't it?


309
0:7:44,9 --> 0:7:46,28
STEVE SPANGLER: But this, now on
somebody would look really


310
0:7:46,28 --> 0:7:47,8
good, right?


311
0:7:47,8 --> 0:7:47,91
DOUG HODOUS: No.


312
0:7:47,91 --> 0:7:48,8
That would not look very good.


313
0:7:48,8 --> 0:7:49,44
STEVE SPANGLER: No,
not like this.


314
0:7:49,44 --> 0:7:49,92
But this.


315
0:7:49,92 --> 0:7:51,16
It's not disappearing
too fast.


316
0:7:51,16 --> 0:7:51,56
So for a joke.


317
0:7:51,56 --> 0:7:53,23
DOUG HODOUS: Oh, I'd say that's
just perfect, because


318
0:7:53,23 --> 0:7:55,13
then they get a little concerned
about it, like is


319
0:7:55,13 --> 0:7:56,42
this really going to go away.


320
0:7:56,42 --> 0:7:57,92
STEVE SPANGLER: So,
like, look, see?


321
0:7:57,92 --> 0:7:59,52
See your little lab
coat is working.


322
0:7:59,52 --> 0:8:0,91
How awesome is that?


323
0:8:0,91 --> 0:8:1,85
DOUG HODOUS: Well
try over here.


324
0:8:1,85 --> 0:8:2,31
STEVE SPANGLER: There you go.


325
0:8:2,31 --> 0:8:3,9
Isn't that nice?


326
0:8:3,9 --> 0:8:4,0
DOUG HODOUS: Try and stay
away from my skin,


327
0:8:4,0 --> 0:8:5,38
though, would you, Ace?


328
0:8:5,38 --> 0:8:6,26
STEVE SPANGLER: See, this is--


329
0:8:6,26 --> 0:8:8,1
DOUG HODOUS: I think we got
enough, I get the idea.


330
0:8:8,1 --> 0:8:10,2
STEVE SPANGLER: So if you just
had a source of carbon


331
0:8:10,2 --> 0:8:12,37
dioxide, then you could actually
make this change


332
0:8:12,37 --> 0:8:13,15
back, is that right?


333
0:8:13,15 --> 0:8:15,72
DOUG HODOUS: I could get the
other fellas here, but I don't


334
0:8:15,72 --> 0:8:16,82
believe they can breathe
strong enough.


335
0:8:16,82 --> 0:8:17,34
STEVE SPANGLER: Never guess what
I found, which I thought


336
0:8:17,34 --> 0:8:18,45
was absolutely perfect.


337
0:8:18,45 --> 0:8:18,82
DOUG HODOUS: What?


338
0:8:18,82 --> 0:8:20,7
They don't sell carbon
dioxide.


339
0:8:20,7 --> 0:8:23,26



340
0:8:23,26 --> 0:8:26,38
STEVE SPANGLER: Now, this being
carbon dioxide, not only


341
0:8:26,38 --> 0:8:28,51
freezes your skin and
makes you slightly


342
0:8:28,51 --> 0:8:30,27
static electric charged.


343
0:8:30,27 --> 0:8:32,702
Look, it's clearing off.


344
0:8:32,702 --> 0:8:34,47
DOUG HODOUS: But
I'm still wet.


345
0:8:34,47 --> 0:8:36,55
STEVE SPANGLER: I know, you--


346
0:8:36,55 --> 0:8:37,64
Turn around, Ace.


347
0:8:37,64 --> 0:8:40,32
Turn around.


348
0:8:40,32 --> 0:8:41,96
DOUG HODOUS: How about a little
respect here for an


349
0:8:41,96 --> 0:8:42,63
older person?


350
0:8:42,63 --> 0:8:42,929
STEVE SPANGLER: Look
at this, wow.


351
0:8:42,929 --> 0:8:46,89
There's a static charge on you,
and, ah, look, all of the


352
0:8:46,89 --> 0:8:47,96
ink has gone away.


353
0:8:47,96 --> 0:8:48,23
DOUG HODOUS: Yeah


354
0:8:48,23 --> 0:8:49,846
STEVE SPANGLER: Aside from this
shirt, that I think you


355
0:8:49,846 --> 0:8:50,84
still had when I was
in high school.


356
0:8:50,84 --> 0:8:51,44
DOUG HODOUS: Hey, you've got
a dry shirt with you?


357
0:8:51,44 --> 0:8:52,7
Hey, take off that shirt,
let's exchange


358
0:8:52,7 --> 0:8:53,83
here a little bit.


359
0:8:53,83 --> 0:8:55,78
STEVE SPANGLER: We have
everything that we need for


360
0:8:55,78 --> 0:8:56,73
disappearing ink.


361
0:8:56,73 --> 0:8:58,71
Simple acid-based reaction.


362
0:8:58,71 --> 0:8:59,78
This is the extreme.


363
0:8:59,78 --> 0:9:1,4
I simply would just let
it sit out there.


364
0:9:1,4 --> 0:9:2,15
And it would disappear.


365
0:9:2,15 --> 0:9:3,26
DOUG HODOUS: And I think
we can see already.


366
0:9:3,26 --> 0:9:3,99
This has disappeared.


367
0:9:3,99 --> 0:9:4,97
STEVE SPANGLER: But this
would scare somebody.


368
0:9:4,97 --> 0:9:6,367
They would really think
that maybe you


369
0:9:6,367 --> 0:9:7,16
got some ink on them.


370
0:9:7,16 --> 0:9:8,32
And that would be great.


371
0:9:8,32 --> 0:9:9,1
DOUG HODOUS: Oh, I had a
friend I did this on.


372
0:9:9,1 --> 0:9:10,905
He had a suit and tie on, and
I put that on his new white


373
0:9:10,905 --> 0:9:11,49
shirt and--


374
0:9:11,49 --> 0:9:12,45
STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah,
that's great.


375
0:9:12,45 --> 0:9:14,5
Doug Hodous from Heritage
High School, my


376
0:9:14,5 --> 0:9:15,17
first chemistry teacher.


377
0:9:15,17 --> 0:9:16,6
You never forget
the great ones.


378
0:9:16,6 --> 0:9:19,9
And I'm doing what I'm doing
today because of this man


379
0:9:19,9 --> 0:9:19,7
right here.


380
0:9:19,7 --> 0:9:20,44
And that's it.


381
0:9:20,44 --> 0:9:23,33
That's all we're doing--


382
0:9:23,33 --> 0:9:25,39
Well, the disappearing ink that
Doug Hodous helped us


383
0:9:25,39 --> 0:9:27,95
make is very, very cool, But
no matter how cool it is--


384
0:9:27,95 --> 0:9:29,5
I've put some in
this pipette--


385
0:9:29,5 --> 0:9:32,5
it's just impossible, even
if loaded with a pen,


386
0:9:32,5 --> 0:9:35,896
to write with it.


387
0:9:35,896 --> 0:9:36,95
I just--


388
0:9:36,95 --> 0:9:37,88
it's nothing.


389
0:9:37,88 --> 0:9:40,5
So it's fun to squirt on people,
but it's really hard


390
0:9:40,5 --> 0:9:40,83
to write with.


391
0:9:40,83 --> 0:9:42,97
So I want you to have something
that you could write


392
0:9:42,97 --> 0:9:45,33
with that's our kind of a modern
day disappearing ink,


393
0:9:45,33 --> 0:9:46,68
that's not at a joke shop.


394
0:9:46,68 --> 0:9:48,35
And I've come to find
out there really is.


395
0:9:48,35 --> 0:9:49,37
Take a look at this.


396
0:9:49,37 --> 0:9:51,41
It's a pilot friction pen.


397
0:9:51,41 --> 0:9:53,24
There are pens that you
can find at a local


398
0:9:53,24 --> 0:9:55,4
office supply place.


399
0:9:55,4 --> 0:9:57,21
And they're very, very cool
because they are the kind of


400
0:9:57,21 --> 0:9:59,13
pen that will erase.


401
0:9:59,13 --> 0:10:0,27
The ink erases.


402
0:10:0,27 --> 0:10:2,71
So, for example, here's
the pen, and you


403
0:10:2,71 --> 0:10:8,5
write hello, all right?


404
0:10:8,5 --> 0:10:12,62
So now, the ink actually is a
thermochromatic ink, which


405
0:10:12,62 --> 0:10:14,73
means that it changes
with temperature.


406
0:10:14,73 --> 0:10:16,11
It changes color with
temperature.


407
0:10:16,11 --> 0:10:20,675
So watch, I can use the eraser
here and erase the ink.


408
0:10:20,675 --> 0:10:22,88
What I'm actually doing is
heating up the paper.


409
0:10:22,88 --> 0:10:24,61
Just like you take your hands,
and you rub your hands


410
0:10:24,61 --> 0:10:26,13
together and you create
friction.


411
0:10:26,13 --> 0:10:30,34
So the friction pen works just
by that by creating friction.


412
0:10:30,34 --> 0:10:33,305
And so I can simply
erase the ink.


413
0:10:33,305 --> 0:10:36,5
Well, It's great to be able to
erase the ink like this.


414
0:10:36,5 --> 0:10:39,3
What would happen if you
used something else


415
0:10:39,3 --> 0:10:40,6
to erase the ink.


416
0:10:40,6 --> 0:10:41,33
I don't think the manufacturers


417
0:10:41,33 --> 0:10:44,51
though about this.


418
0:10:44,51 --> 0:10:46,3
Say, I owe you some money.


419
0:10:46,3 --> 0:10:48,12
And I simply write a
little IOU here.


420
0:10:48,12 --> 0:10:51,79
I owe you a $100, and I
sign my name to it.


421
0:10:51,79 --> 0:10:55,32
That could be pretty dangerous,
because the IOU


422
0:10:55,32 --> 0:10:58,56
might not really be the greatest
IOU in the world.


423
0:10:58,56 --> 0:10:59,6
What if it gets hot?


424
0:10:59,6 --> 0:11:0,74
Here watch this.


425
0:11:0,74 --> 0:11:3,255
Here's our flame.


426
0:11:3,255 --> 0:11:4,58
Watch.


427
0:11:4,58 --> 0:11:5,756
Like this.


428
0:11:5,756 --> 0:11:9,54
The IOU seem to vanish.


429
0:11:9,54 --> 0:11:11,74
But I don't think it's
gone for good.


430
0:11:11,74 --> 0:11:15,92
In fact, I can't get
it back this way.


431
0:11:15,92 --> 0:11:18,54
What if I got it cold enough,
would it come back?


432
0:11:18,54 --> 0:11:19,79
Let's got to the refrigerator.


433
0:11:19,79 --> 0:11:23,69



434
0:11:23,69 --> 0:11:25,38
Let's throw it in the freezer
and see what happens.


435
0:11:25,38 --> 0:11:28,242



436
0:11:28,242 --> 0:11:37,16
[MUSIC PLAYING]


437
0:11:37,16 --> 0:11:40,196
Look, the message is back.


438
0:11:40,196 --> 0:11:42,56
And If you don't want to owe
the money anymore, you just


439
0:11:42,56 --> 0:11:43,78
simply heat it back up again.


440
0:11:43,78 --> 0:11:44,55
Watch.


441
0:11:44,55 --> 0:11:46,46
And it's gone.


442
0:11:46,46 --> 0:11:49,57
So, unless you read the contract
in a freezer, I don't


443
0:11:49,57 --> 0:11:51,81
owe the hundred bucks.


444
0:11:51,81 --> 0:11:54,2
So here's a challenge
that's kind of fun.


445
0:11:54,2 --> 0:11:56,72
You can write a secret message
If you want to.


446
0:11:56,72 --> 0:11:59,97
And you could use a combination
of a regular pen


447
0:11:59,97 --> 0:12:1,97
that won't vanish, and
of course, this


448
0:12:1,97 --> 0:12:3,26
friction pen from Pilot.


449
0:12:3,26 --> 0:12:3,92
OK.


450
0:12:3,92 --> 0:12:6,8
So, let's just say, to make
it easy, you're just doing


451
0:12:6,8 --> 0:12:7,79
numbers real fast.


452
0:12:7,79 --> 0:12:9,9
So let's write numbers
the way that a


453
0:12:9,9 --> 0:12:11,25
calculator would have numbers.


454
0:12:11,25 --> 0:12:14,17
Pretty easy now to
change these.


455
0:12:14,17 --> 0:12:16,39
This was the permanent pen.


456
0:12:16,39 --> 0:12:18,47
This is the friction pen.


457
0:12:18,47 --> 0:12:19,515
So, here, let's change
this up.


458
0:12:19,515 --> 0:12:22,84
Let's make this one
a four right here.


459
0:12:22,84 --> 0:12:24,865
This is our secret message.


460
0:12:24,865 --> 0:12:26,875
Let see what happen when
we heat it up.


461
0:12:26,875 --> 0:12:29,785



462
0:12:29,785 --> 0:12:31,16
Here you go.


463
0:12:31,16 --> 0:12:33,57
One through ten.


464
0:12:33,57 --> 0:12:34,91
My video guy came
up with this.


465
0:12:34,91 --> 0:12:36,64
He wanted me to look
at this message.


466
0:12:36,64 --> 0:12:38,46
This is his secret message.


467
0:12:38,46 --> 0:12:41,21
Watch out, the guy shooting
potatoes is Steve Spangler,


468
0:12:41,21 --> 0:12:44,8
who wants to be a special
effects artist in Hollywood.


469
0:12:44,8 --> 0:12:46,48
This is the secret message.


470
0:12:46,48 --> 0:12:49,32
Let's see what It really says.


471
0:12:49,32 --> 0:12:51,35
Watch.


472
0:12:51,35 --> 0:12:53,67
Watch the.


473
0:12:53,67 --> 0:12:55,87
Watch the.


474
0:12:55,87 --> 0:12:58,3
Watch the Spangler effect!


475
0:12:58,3 --> 0:12:59,37
So here's what I
want you to do.


476
0:12:59,37 --> 0:13:1,92
Go get yourself some of these
friction pens and come up with


477
0:13:1,92 --> 0:13:3,1
your own secret message.


478
0:13:3,1 --> 0:13:4,88
Some cool thing that appears.


479
0:13:4,88 --> 0:13:8,22
And post it as a video response
here on this page.


480
0:13:8,22 --> 0:13:9,742
The Spangler effect.


481
0:13:9,742 --> 0:13:10,15
All right.


482
0:13:10,15 --> 0:13:13,31
Let's take everything that we
learned, and turn this into a


483
0:13:13,31 --> 0:13:15,76
segment with the meteorologist
Becky Ditchfield.


484
0:13:15,76 --> 0:13:17,83
She's very, very gullible.


485
0:13:17,83 --> 0:13:20,17
I could probably convince her
that this disappearing ink is


486
0:13:20,17 --> 0:13:22,4
actually a biological stain.


487
0:13:22,4 --> 0:13:24,195
And maybe we can have
a little surprise


488
0:13:24,195 --> 0:13:25,61
ending for her as well.


489
0:13:25,61 --> 0:13:30,12



490
0:13:30,12 --> 0:13:32,32
BECKY DITCHFIELD: So we're going
in for a Steve Spangler


491
0:13:32,32 --> 0:13:33,31
science experiment.


492
0:13:33,31 --> 0:13:35,77
And, unlike a lot of other
times, I have no idea what's


493
0:13:35,77 --> 0:13:36,15
going to happen.


494
0:13:36,15 --> 0:13:38,9
So, this is going to be
interesting today.


495
0:13:38,9 --> 0:13:40,31
STEVE SPANGLER: So today we're
talking chemistry.


496
0:13:40,31 --> 0:13:43,13
And this is a biological
stain.


497
0:13:43,13 --> 0:13:43,94
OK?


498
0:13:43,94 --> 0:13:44,78
BECKY DITCHFIELD: What
does that mean?


499
0:13:44,78 --> 0:13:46,1
STEVE SPANGLER: It's not.


500
0:13:46,1 --> 0:13:46,923
This is an ink.


501
0:13:46,923 --> 0:13:47,63
BECKY DITCHFIELD: Oh, OK.


502
0:13:47,63 --> 0:13:47,91
STEVE SPANGLER: So, see--


503
0:13:47,91 --> 0:13:48,35
Yeah.


504
0:13:48,35 --> 0:13:49,445
So here is, see the
ink that's here?


505
0:13:49,445 --> 0:13:49,91
BECKY DITCHFIELD: Yeah.


506
0:13:49,91 --> 0:13:51,16
STEVE SPANGLER: It's this
blue little ink.


507
0:13:51,16 --> 0:13:51,42
BECKY DITCHFIELD: Right.


508
0:13:51,42 --> 0:13:52,44
STEVE SPANGLER: It's hard
to see it here,


509
0:13:52,44 --> 0:13:53,47
so here watch this.


510
0:13:53,47 --> 0:13:54,34
If I just--


511
0:13:54,34 --> 0:13:54,71
See?


512
0:13:54,71 --> 0:13:55,6
BECKY DITCHFIELD: Are you?


513
0:13:55,6 --> 0:13:55,65
Ah There you go.


514
0:13:55,65 --> 0:13:56,98
Isn't that beautiful?


515
0:13:56,98 --> 0:13:58,38
So this is-- isn't that great?


516
0:13:58,38 --> 0:14:0,4
Ah, this is gorgeous.


517
0:14:0,4 --> 0:14:1,88
It doesn't really leak
through too much.


518
0:14:1,88 --> 0:14:3,45
But it's-- isn't this great?


519
0:14:3,45 --> 0:14:4,13
This is--


520
0:14:4,13 --> 0:14:5,28
BECKY DITCHFIELD: Oh, no.


521
0:14:5,28 --> 0:14:5,35
STEVE SPANGLER: It's fine.


522
0:14:5,35 --> 0:14:6,1
It's just a stronger--


523
0:14:6,1 --> 0:14:7,78
BECKY DITCHFIELD: Oh, my God.


524
0:14:7,78 --> 0:14:10,31
STEVE SPANGLER: See, this is
a stronger source of--


525
0:14:10,31 --> 0:14:11,54
see how fast--


526
0:14:11,54 --> 0:14:13,93
see how it changes back
just like this?


527
0:14:13,93 --> 0:14:15,22
BECKY DITCHFIELD: Yeah,
that's really--


528
0:14:15,22 --> 0:14:15,97
STEVE SPANGLER: See,
it's changing back.


529
0:14:15,97 --> 0:14:16,99
BECKY DITCHFIELD: Wow.


530
0:14:16,99 --> 0:14:19,97
STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah, Let's
see on your back.


531
0:14:19,97 --> 0:14:20,8
You are--


532
0:14:20,8 --> 0:14:21,315
it's fine now.


533
0:14:21,315 --> 0:14:22,5
BECKY DITCHFIELD: No.


534
0:14:22,5 --> 0:14:23,465
STEVE SPANGLER: See,
isn't that great?


535
0:14:23,465 --> 0:14:25,825
BECKY DITCHFIELD: Ah, now I know
why you had that covered


536
0:14:25,825 --> 0:14:27,3
up, Steve Spangler.


537
0:14:27,3 --> 0:14:29,44
STEVE SPANGLER: This is another
source-- and I just


538
0:14:29,44 --> 0:14:31,96
want people to know that this
is carbon dioxide fire


539
0:14:31,96 --> 0:14:32,4
extinguisher.


540
0:14:32,4 --> 0:14:35,27
And look, you are completely
back to normal, minus just a


541
0:14:35,27 --> 0:14:36,32
small amount of snow.


542
0:14:36,32 --> 0:14:37,4
So you're fine.


543
0:14:37,4 --> 0:14:37,97
You're fine.


544
0:14:37,97 --> 0:14:38,437
BECKY DITCHFIELD: Uh-huh.


545
0:14:38,437 --> 0:14:40,305
STEVE SPANGLER: See,
isn't that great?


546
0:14:40,305 --> 0:14:41,706
This is why I use Becky.


547
0:14:41,706 --> 0:14:42,84
Here she is fantastic.


548
0:14:42,84 --> 0:14:43,38
But look.


549
0:14:43,38 --> 0:14:44,84
This is what most people
don't realize.


550
0:14:44,84 --> 0:14:48,2
Fire extinguishers will produce
a small amount of that


551
0:14:48,2 --> 0:14:48,475
condensation.


552
0:14:48,475 --> 0:14:50,43
And so she is kind of cold.


553
0:14:50,43 --> 0:14:51,59
BECKY DITCHFIELD: Freezing.


554
0:14:51,59 --> 0:14:52,27
I thought--


555
0:14:52,27 --> 0:14:53,1
STEVE SPANGLER: See
how that works?


556
0:14:53,1 --> 0:14:55,23
BECKY DITCHFIELD: I'm afraid
to touch this coat.


557
0:14:55,23 --> 0:14:55,42
STEVE SPANGLER: You're OK.


558
0:14:55,42 --> 0:14:57,79
Take off your little
microphone.


559
0:14:57,79 --> 0:14:58,61
BECKY DITCHFIELD: Here we go.


560
0:14:58,61 --> 0:14:58,87
STEVE SPANGLER: Look at this.


561
0:14:58,87 --> 0:14:59,25
Look at this.


562
0:14:59,25 --> 0:15:0,82
She is perfectly fine.


563
0:15:0,82 --> 0:15:1,32
BECKY DITCHFIELD: Ahh.


564
0:15:1,32 --> 0:15:3,565
STEVE SPANGLER: Minus the small
amount of coldness, see


565
0:15:3,565 --> 0:15:5,9
she's fine.


566
0:15:5,9 --> 0:15:6,41
She's not working
with me anymore.


567
0:15:6,41 --> 0:15:7,48
BECKY DITCHFIELD: Yeah,
you're right.


568

fine, she's fine.
