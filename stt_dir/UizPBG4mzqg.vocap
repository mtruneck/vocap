###63 how did it for
###64 and why he in the heart of the rock
###69 scientists studying yellowstone are uncovering the violent past
###74 by warts
###75 crushed by simply chance
###79 blasted by the biggest organic eruptions ever known on the plane
###92 even today
###93 yellowstone's is one of the most dangerous places on earth
###107 yellowstone national park is one of the most amazing places on earth
###111 had
###115 saying some of america's most stunning scenery
###119 wildlife that attracts three million tourists a year
###125 to understand we're yellowstone came from
###128 why it is so acted today
###130 we need to take a journey back into the distant past at the north american cars
###135 deep into the earth's painting
###141 sixty thousand feet up on the road
###143 of mountain plateau
###145 primarily with in wyoming but stretching into parts of ohio
###149 montana
###152 park covers three thousand

###164 and it's a long time
###166 most unusual
###168 geological structures
###171 warts and usual doubt partner
###174 are the wildlife unusual
###178 is the wide open space unusual
###181 no you've got it all over the western u_s_
###184 what's unusual
###186 it's a very unusual geology and created a partner
###192 yellowstone was fair
###193 hundred as the world's first national park because of
###198 victory our dream
###201 it's this strange geology that attracts teams of scientists to the park
###206 their task
###207 to piece together the story of the incredible processes that build this
###211 unique extraordinary landscape
###215 hiking indeed
###216 into yellowstone's past
###219 geologic history
###221 yellowstone
###223 goes back to the formation of the north american continent
###227 summarizing it was still
###229 are two point eight
###231 three point two billion your old rock some of the police in north america
###238 only by traveling back into the past and we figure out why didn't this particular
###242 location
###244 there are two thousand four hundred miles of river more than three hundred
###248 waterfall
###252 and the world's greatest concentration ten thousand hot water springs
###257 development models
###259 yes vents
###260 and guys
###263 what did these features revealed about this landscape
###266 how it was for
###274 the investigation begins at yellowstone
###276 star traction
###278 old faithful
###281 it's a key clues to what's going on underneath the surface
###290 located in the southwest of yellowstone park
###293 geyser puts on an explosive display every ninety minutes or so
###299 blasting out thousands of gallons scalding hot
###308 yellowstone is like no other places on earth there is so mickey coming out here
###312 it's really singular phenomenon
###316 flat fair and i did
###318 will pay for his word back to life there was an actually napping was recharging
###322 the temperature of the water was increasing missus was fresh arising
###326 develop it was a rather complex plumbing systems filled with patrons and conduit
###331 think constrictions
###334 rainwater saturating the ground around the geysers slowly feels is underground
###338 reservoir
###341 hot rocks below ground heat the water under pressure for around ninety minutes
###347 suddenly some water spurts through a tiny five-inch white crack in the wrong
###352 this causes a drop in the pressure within the water chamber
###357 in an instant
###358 thousands of gallons of water returned to steve blasted up into the air
###368 under pressure builds up enough steam bubbles rise to the surface persistent
###372 depressurizing senate collapsed
###376 faithful shows that rocks below the surface of very hot
###388 scientists find clues to a violent past thirty four miles southeast of the hot
###393 springs
###394 on the shores of the circular lake called indian park
###400 telecast
###402 my job is to basically be a rock detect them
###405 and so i decided to determine what their origin is and what they history isn't
###410 that particular rock
###414 okay now in this particular case
###417 let's look at this
###419 this track
###420 when it started it was just a loose
###422 saint you can just bring your fingers to it
###426 the solid boulder is formed from the millions of individual grains of sand
###433 microscopic analysis reveals the grades have been cemented together by chemicals
###437 and pressure deep under the ground
###442 how did the rock get to the surface
###447 morgan has chemically david the rocks discovered in three thousand years ago
###451 the boulder was blasted out of the ground by the hot water explosion of a
###456 gigantic geysers
###459 u_n_c_
###460 for a little longer
###462 rock fragments
###464 team in terry l
###466 rejected i think i mean
###469 as high as
###470 he took five thousand feet
###472 and their at some point material would start with
###477 running this explosion column
###480 now you wouldn't wanna be standing next to one of those
###486 indian park
###487 as the crater that the guys are left behind
###495 but fifties dwarfed by the crater morgan has found it may repay
###499 in yellowstone
###504 stated this geyser explosions of thirteen thousand years ago
###509 so here we are one yellowstone lake
###512 and it says you can see in beautiful day and flights in plastic
###517 on the floor of yellowstone lake it's anything but quiet
###521 morgan's research proves that geysers were exploding around the lake and even
###525 under the water between thirty thousand and three thousand years ago
###532 fantasizing jess that whatever was power in numbers
###536 but is it still active today
###540 aclu comes from underwater events at the bottom of the guys are greater
###545 they talk about vast quantities of hot water and gases
###554 we
###555 to find out what's creating the gases
###558 gigolo eastern in his assistant collect samples from the hot springs in the
###561 center of the park
###566 the final they use is designed to collect up gas bubbles before they reach
###569 the surface so that they're not contaminated by four to three years
###575 soooooooo
###580 it is a very complex with the gases and but we have a lot of tools that we can
###584 use to try to unravels rather
###587 complicated information
###590 so will look at all of the gas is the kind and caring for about the different
###594 kinds of rocks beneath the ocean
###595 and try to understand how things might be changing from from week to week here
###600 two years
###601 defeat
###604 analysis of the gases reveals that they are a mix of carbon dioxide sulfur
###608 dioxide
###609 and hydrogen sulfide
###611 it is the same mix that is found coming out of altadena
###619 but the final clue to what is actually going on underground is found on the
###622 edge of the same hot springs
###626 sent the request crystals that we've collected on the site of the pool
###630 all their discusses what remains gets pasta proposal but one-sided
###635 consultant beautiful little quartz crystals some of them have a little bit
###638 of iron staining in other things
###641 uh... that most most of the american and said she was in the olympics here
###647 quartz crystals like being used in a moment of formed as a hot molten rock
###651 lava flow
###652 slowly cool after being erupted onto the surface from deep underground so the
###659 crystals a clear evidence that under the springs is a volcano
###668 yellowstone's hot water features all going to one conclusion
###673 yellowstone must be power
###678 geysers only erupted the rocks are hot enough to turn water into steam
###682 gases from underwater have the same composition as those from volcanoes
###688 ports in the hot springs must have come from paul ten o'clock
###693 there is an immense amount of energy coming out of the gramm
###697 the six prayer
###699 the guises the mud pots the hot springs in the standards where's all that heat
###704 coming from is coming from the molten rock associated with the yellowstone
###709 volcano
###712 that leaves a big question
###713 unanswered
###715 this gentle rolling landscape
###718 clears the ball
###732 yellowstone's unique volcanic geology
###734 is potentially deadly dangerous
###738 it makes a crucial to monitor what's happening under the ground
###742 they yellowstone what do you know is a very very active volcanic system and so
###746 it really
###747 requires observation
###750 everything that we do here has a research component but it also has a
###754 volcano monitoring component
###756 and that is is
###758 is activity picks up here we're gonna want to know something about the
###762 plummets dancing
###765 to try and project when yellowstone's hidden volcano with the roads in the
###769 future
###770 scientists study it's geological past
###775 predatory passed because to look at the landscape
###778 in reno
###780 the geologic story and there's so many clues and so much evidence here
###786 yet that it's a fascinating place to work
###792 scientists began investigating yellowstone
###795 even before it became the world's first national park
###798 in eighteen seventy two
###801 but observations of this astonishing land began long before that
###812 dating aged arrowheads shows that native americans first lived here eleven
###816 thousand years ago
###820 their legends of yellowstone's angry spirits who made the ground tremble were
###824 passed on to her early explorers such as louis and clark
###830 later reports from trappers explorers and mountain men like john coulter jim
###835 bridger sold of geysers defiance in defeat into the air and springs so hot
###841 that meet was red lead kolkata
###846 but these with ought to be told tales to the eighteen sixties when geologist
###851 investigated and found that the lava flows and high there's which side
###855 so volcanic activity
###859 s
###861 sts
###863 tests
###865 but something really wasn't liked
###868 nobody could actually find the yellowstone volcano
###873 considerate know as soon as one of the world
###876 most active volcanoes
###878 people come out here visitors other son
###880 interest-sensitive what do you mean oh... i don't see it
###884 smoking volcano i don't see it
###889 crater
###891 all the things that one normally thinks of for an active volcano
###895 so without obvious signs of a volcano
###898 scientists wanted for other things
###903 they would find them
###905 in the sweeping forests of launch cold calling
###909 these are the only plans to thrive on the poor soil that comes from a
###912 particular type of lava called right away
###920 yellowstone's constant plagues of mosquitoes also revealed the presence of
###924 that same right life lol
###929 then i lighter
###930 are you not very firmly involved
###935 makes those long ponds and water that member info away
###940 knows her wonderful breeding grounds
###944 with students
###945 are a lot of status if you can see and flying around my head
###949 so the pine trees in the insects both indicates that there's a lot of right
###953 like in yellowstone
###958 because while i'd love a creates incredibly violent volcanic eruptions
###964 that's much more like a bread dough it's about a thousand two million times
###970 thicker are more viscous we put a bunch of gases
###973 we can have a very explosive eruptions
###977 but if the rial i'd love it that explosive
###980 how big a bang did it for today
###996 to find that out scientist looks not inside yellowstone park
###1000 within a faraway river valley meadow creek wyoming
###1008 cutting down through the land over millions of years the river has exposed
###1012 and unusual thin layer of plaque rocking in the cliff face
###1019 nearby road cutting leads investigators examined the mysterious dark rod
###1030 if you look at this airport indicate what close
###1033 you can see that the here's a promise fragment
###1036 these these
###1037 restaurants here fragments
###1041 and to pat if we were to make it this section of this rock i look at it under
###1044 the microscope
###1046 you in fact seat compressed
###1048 uh... glass shards
###1051 the black later the geologists call them sitting
###1054 is actually a type of glass
###1058 it's crucial evidence that the rocks and soil here came out of a volcano
###1065 because of sitting in his support boiling hot passion gas rapidly cool
###1070 under great pressure
###1075 and that's just what happened
###1076 when hot mechanical out
###1078 rollout across the land
###1082 deals in the importance of the very bottom layer
###1085 from below and crushed by the way to pop the agreeing on the top
###1092 national air the crash the city in the head of free still
###1096 visible today
###1099 its base is characterized by this very
###1101 that dancin sitting in a citizen blow came to rest and was compacted
###1106 and then above this dance glass layer is their grades upwards into a tam sort of
###1110 region and continues up for about an additional thirty feet and then up on
###1114 top of that
###1115 is expose today marshall has formed and we can see growing up there three sets
###1120 of education trees and grasses and things of that sort
###1125 study in the middle composition of the proved that it came from an ancient
###1129 volcanic blast in yellowstone park
###1134 and there's only one way did so much that she could have been blasted so very
###1138 far away
###1139 from its own
###1141 eruption must have been larger far larger than anything ever seen by man
###1148 so big
###1149 scientists now label it as a super eruption
###1154 we're looking at the statistics deposit from a super optioned and yet where over
###1159 fifty miles source of the will be eruption
###1164 geologists of recreated what must happen here on the day the p_l_o_ so that's
###1169 good
###1171 can destined avalanches of ash raced out of the park in all directions
###1177 services traveling at very high velocity uh... easily over
###1181 hundred miles per hour crossed one sentence
###1185 and february everything in its path is extremely hot movie right
###1190 and perhaps is not a specific united degrees fahrenheit
###1194 sewage wastes a pizza oven and it's just very hot
###1198 someone would it have been like to be standing on this five hundreds of
###1201 thousands of years ago
###1204 the date when the yellowstone ash cloud roared over the horizon
###1209 that the impact of this would would be in absolutely
###1213 unimaginable you would be i think you would be dissecting culated
###1216 there and and and unrecognizable and it would be very difficult to find any of
###1221 you
###1225 all of the evidence about the size of the super eruption help solve the
###1229 mystery of the missing volcano
###1232 scientists realized that the super iraq's and was so enormous
###1236 but it must have blown the volcano to pieces
###1245 swarms of mosquitoes
###1246 show that explosive rial i'd love a underlies parts of the park
###1251 subsidy in the last sixty miles away reveals that nashville spread from miles
###1256 around yellowstone
###1258 thick layers of debris
###1260 confirm how gigantic an explosion this must have been
###1266 problem now is the explosive legacy physical volcano left behind
###1271 deadly dangerous to listen
###1274 deep onto the ground
###1284 for nearly a century after yellowstone national park was established nobody
###1288 realized one
###1289 astonishing fat
###1293 at the park
###1294 is located inside one of the biggest volcano creators on her
###1301 it wasn't until the late nineteen sixties that american geophysicist
###1305 robert christians realized that rock formations he had been studying for
###1309 several years all around the edges of the park
###1313 in fact formed a giant circular free
###1319 he compared his findings on the ground with a series of nasa pictures taken
###1322 between nineteen sixty six
###1325 in nineteen seventy
###1327 confirming
###1328 that the rain was the reason of a giant crater
###1332 forty-five miles across
###1337 parts of the crater reimburse still clearly visible today
###1341 but the other
###1341 edge is almost out of sight
###1350 finding the crater coincided with another scientific discovery in a
###1353 totally different part of the country
###1359 in california scientists identified a strange then later in any buried
###1364 underneath the modern days only
###1367 dash matched material from the yellowstone crater
###1372 dating the soil layers proved that the ash arrive six hundred forty thousand
###1376 years ago
###1378 scientists at last had a date yellowstone super
###1388 gash was later found all over the western u_s_ confirming the huge size of
###1395 the eruption
###1398 at least eighty times the size of the eighteen eighty three explosions that
###1402 destroyed the island crack itself
###1414 and twenty five hundred times bigger
###1416 nineteen eighty arrests of mount saint helens
###1424 the almost unimaginable sides of the yellowstone last means but scientists
###1428 now with all that
###1429 a super lonely
###1437 but that creates another mystery
###1439 this peaceful landscape
###1442 weird is the steaming hot crater that the volcano must have left behind
###1448 aim when you're looking at a press toward instant also
###1451 rolling hills and entry
###1454 so obviously there's not a big hole left in the ground uh... from the reaction of
###1458 the above the elston volcano so something else has happened
###1463 one of the first processes was instilling with all sorts of volcanic
###1467 lava flows
###1468 entity that's just down from the landscape for dust recency one of their
###1473 all this blah blah flows that
###1475 happened after the sixteen forty thousand your option
###1480 over hundreds of thousands of years this flow has weathered insists oreo been
###1484 covered with stream
###1489 minnows we're in the born or a different type of love and it wasn't
###1493 still bare of vegetation because this love of was still a rough up until about
###1498 one hundred thousand years ago and
###1502 later love of was far less explosive and more running cooled slowly
###1510 this move the harsh mohammed landscape into yellowstone softer countryside
###1522 that made
###1523 when it first more tranquil
###1529 but there's evidence here that the land was soon varied once again
###1533 this time by freezing snow and ice
###1536 the perot
###1538 the ice that polish the rocks has a story to tell
###1543 it offers crucial evidence about volcanic forces still shaking the park
###1547 to this day
###1553 its tail unfolds through the tiniest of clues
###1558 scratches on the rocks reveal which way the ice was moving
###1564 they show that lisa is always sleep the same way
###1568 outwards and downwards from the vice captain of the heart of the farm
###1574 the only conclusion is that something pushed up yellowstone park
###1578 so much higher than the surrounding hills the glaciers formed on the top
###1595 but what force could possibly powerful enough to have raised yellowstone speaks
###1600 off into the air
###1612 the first clues to help answer that question comes from yellowstone's
###1615 numerous persuades
###1618 whenever on the forms
###1620 the creaks and groans like astronomer this violent but the creaks and groans
###1623 and since the earthquakes
###1626 the quakes are recorded by sized monitors all over the phone
###1632 the earthquake monitoring is a critical part of the trip because it's basically
###1635 it's the stethoscope that we have to
###1638 really see incense
###1640 the the heartbeat of the system
###1648 smith is investigating possibly geological mystery
###1655 yellowstone has up to five thousand earthquake cv
###1659 even though it's in the stable heart
###1661 the north american continent
###1665 scientists needed to know what was happening underground to shake the park
###1669 so my
###1672 to find out
###1674 they plotted the precise locations and deaths of earthquakes under the ground
###1684 so why are there so many quakes
###1691 the answer had to wait until the mid-nineteen eighties whenever more
###1695 powerful computers first let's scientist c
###1698 engineer
###1701 seismic waves burning out from earthquakes travel rapidly through cold
###1705 wrong
###1706 but slow down
###1707 the rocks are hot
###1709 the burying wave speeds can be translated by confusing
###1713 two color three d images revealing exactly where on-ramp rising to the
###1718 ground
###1719 seismic waves propagate through the years
###1722 just like x_-rays go through a body
###1724 so we use the same physics
###1726 to reconstruct
###1728 the structure of the general of the of the earth beneath this seismic waves of
###1732 outlined the parks underground structures
###1735 revealing a graphic history what's happened upon the yellowstone
###1740 they've revealed this gigantic reservoir of molten
###1744 rock which created yellowstone's crater landlocked erupted out
###1749 the ground above collapsed into the space left behind
###1755 and seismic waves still slow down under yellowstone today
###1758 showing that the magma chambers still
###1761 lurks under the park
###1763 it's more than thirty miles long twenty five miles wide ten miles in death
###1769 criticizing alters here two years since bill for campaigns with sending liquid
###1774 rock managing
###1775 credible fifteen hundred degrees parents
###1778 this is the hidden feeding park yellowstone park
###1783 moves give form to the ground above
###1785 explaining the fault lines in the earthquakes the
###1790 and its heat ultimately powers all of yellowstone's hot water food
###1794 print guys
###1802 subterranean yellowstone is getting a bit secrets
###1806 seismographs reports thousands of earthquakes in the park
###1811 the evidence earthquake waves reveals a massive mac machine
###1815 under yellowstone sir
###1819 yellowstone investigation is far from finished
###1823 because they're scared
###1825 another even more monstrous size structure
###1828 under the park
###1839 by the beginning of the twenty first century scientists investigating how
###1842 yellowstone was made had images of what lay under the party
###1849 there was a problem
###1851 technology only allowed a view of a few miles below the surface
###1856 then as more and more data was heading to more and more powerful computers
###1861 there was a breakthrough
###1864 in april two thousand six geologist publishing diagrams amman structures
###1869 quarantined under the form
###1874 more detailed pictures
###1876 resolves restoring
###1881 investigators all over the last time sleeping monster
###1885 realized below millissa
###1891 snaking down hundreds of miles into the earth
###1895 far deeper into the relatively shallow magma chamber
###1899 is a colossal
###1900 volcanic playing
###1906 really sorry
###1907 howdy bingo
###1909 but they can picture it down to four hundred miles or more
###1913 twice the distance between washington and new york
###1921 smith makes an educated guess about what the underground plume is like
###1927 our best estimates doesn't start doing the physics and i
###1930 and to these things if such a conduit of melted rock what the chimney
###1936 that should be called a hot spot
###1938 pumped up enough heat to build the rocks of the crust and feel the overlying
###1942 magma chamber
###1944 which then erupted
###1946 blast out yellowstone's last crater
###1949 the malval
###1954 understanding of the crater fall
###1956 was an important moment for the investigation
###1962 because there was evidence similar russians that happened before many times
###1967 before
###1980 throughout the nineteen sixties various teams of geologist studied the snake
###1984 river plane
###1985 to the southwest of yellowstone park
###1987 and found traces of ancient volcanic craters
###1993 the crater rims had long been eroded
###1995 their outlines were confirmed by aerial pictures over the following decade
###2003 there and in a straight line along the plane
###2006 heading for the hearts yellowstone park
###2009 on average each crater was a couple of million years boulder than its neighbors
###2015 investigators realize that these are the remnants of earlier super volcano
###2019 explosions
###2021 unbroken chain stretching far back
###2024 to geological history
###2031 it seemed clear time after time
###2034 the hot spot that last bit of a civil rights and
###2039 hot spot appeared to have traveled
###2041 things of mine
###2046 os yet another meeting
###2049 how could a hot spots
###2050 anchored to the core of the planet
###2058 okay
###2063 an important clue had been found in nineteen eighty-five by american
###2066 volcanologists williams gosh he realized that plotting the location of thirty
###2073 thousand earthquakes around yellowstone produced an amazing patterns
###2080 the quake's traced out a giant the ship on the surface of the year
###2087 the vichy wrapped around the hot spots location
###2091 it seemed at first to confirm that the hot spot was still moving
###2096 dribbling of the land around it with all the lines and tens of thousands of
###2099 earthquakes
###2107 but the real answer is made with the theory of plate tectonics
###2111 it showed that is the american continent not the hot spots that's moving
###2119 and the chain of craters on the snake river plane is there because for
###2123 millions of years
###2124 the moving american continent
###2126 has continually bush new land over the stationary hot spots
###2132 what is the north american plate with the forces source of that
###2136 that pops troop
###2137 loaded
###2138 and creates the hot spot track
###2141 assisted you're playing the also just the active proponent of a
###2146 repeated hot spot explosions on the land of make yellowstone
###2153 other hot spots have been identified around the world
###2157 like the one that has created the island chain olwein
###2162 only played for a hot spot has erupted
###2165 accounts
###2170 earlier explosions knew the original mountain
###2172 histories
###2175 dandelions smoothed over with later flows of more running amok
###2179 that was released from deep into the earth's crust
###2189 multiple strands of evidence combine to reveal yellowstone slumbering monster
###2194 gigantic hot spot
###2196 lying under the fall
###2199 quake maps show the hot spots location
###2203 seismic waves revealed the depth of the flu
###2209 earlier craters proof regular super eruptions
###2212 for millions of years
###2214 all of which leads to the most
###2216 question of law
###2219 we'll yellowstone iraq's again
###2234 measuring the amount of geographical spread a bashful from yellowstone
###2237 superdrive produced some terrifying thing
###2244 six hundred forty thousand years ago
###2246 eruption poured out around two hundred forty cubic miles of material
###2252 enough to bury the home of new york state tens of the d inaction
###2258 if it happens again
###2260 thousands will die
###2262 vast areas of the united states will be buried involved can a degree
###2267 but when we get low stone erupt again
###2275 loops and when that next eruption will happen
###2278 comes from investigating the eruptions of the past
###2283 the hot spot punches out a super eruption on average every six hundred
###2287 thousand here
###2292 six hundred
###2293 and forty thousand years ago
###2298 but geologists expect that there will be warning signs before yellowstone
###2301 explodes again
###2306 volcanic eruptions are usually preceded by an increasing number of her
###2313 quakes are assigned underground volcanic chambers are filling
###2317 molten rock an expanding
###2319 stretch than before
###2320 land ball
###2331 yellowstone park usually experiences an average of twelve tiny earthquake
###2335 tremors everyday
###2338 most urgent week to be felt like tourists and register only on the most
###2342 sensitive sized monitors
###2346 but in early two thousand on
###2348 more than four times as many quake started striking everyday
###2352 over one ten day period there were more than five hundred points
###2356 some of the month of magnitude three point nine
###2359 powerful enough to frighten the visitors and with the scientists on alert
###2364 there's a second indicator of increasing paul canning activity
###2370 molten rock
###2371 does inflating underground chamber
###2375 ground above
###2376 will rise
###2382 seems to be happening right now
###2387 unusual evidence to prove it comes from an unlikely source
###2392 the waters of yellowstone lake
###2396 around one hundred years ago small steen ships carried tourists on sightseeing
###2400 trips across the lake
###2402 but one of the ship's caught fire and saying forever below the surface of the
###2406 lake
###2409 but now yellowstone's astonishing geological forces have resurrected the
###2413 ship's remains from their watery grave
###2417 here we have absolved run down to a wider level
###2421 and so this al says something about the defamation and yellowstone
###2427 and basically what's happened is that the uh... floor of the lake has risen
###2432 ringing the bell out of water
###2436 the reappearance of the rack shows that land under and around the lake is rising
###2441 because of the expansion of the magma chamber
###2447 even more alone
###2448 the rate at which it's rising seems to be increasing
###2453 in geological observance
###2454 a huge area of yellowstone park is positively soaring up into the air
###2458 faster than it's ever done before
###2471 the biggest uplift of all has been recorded just a few miles from the shore
###2475 of the lake
###2478 there's a g_p_s_ system here
###2480 a much more sophisticated version of the one in your car in
###2485 in measures not only the surface position
###2487 but also its exact altitude
###2489 into with infractions of image
###2493 there's a small radio intimates here from sits on top of this still ride
###2499 his entered into this route three or four feet
###2502 so if the ground was opened and in turn was opened
###2507 the g_p_s_ and on land on which it's a good removing upwards
###2513 horrible for the
###2514 magma chamber
###2516 and beginning in late two thousand six
###2519 all area ground
###2521 started to rise
###2523 uh... the order of two to three inches per year
###2527 and as our
###2529 sc soul system right here this is an
###2531 about that much
###2533 and it still moving today
###2535 and so we're really seriously pinko stresses the deformation
###2539 the uplift the worst thing at this station
###2543 goes the other thing that yellowstone superbowl kato is threatening to around
###2548 once again
###2550 the question what lies in yellowstone
###2553 geologic future is fascinating
###2556 and uh...
###2559 all of my colleagues glow know the answer to that question
###2564 scientists keep a careful watch of the volcano is active
###2570 c_i_d_
###2571 sciences to understand the process
###2574 and so we have a responsibility
###2576 to see how the system is performing and how it's working
###2579 confirmed that they were the store for us to live of will continue after these
###2583 are folks after all it's what made the system and there was no reason to think
###2588 that people who is in stock
###2592 yellowstone investigation has shown
###2594 at the park sleeping super volcano is still alive and dangers
###2601 underground plumbing
###2602 reveals volcanic each
###2605 obsidian blast tells of a massive eruptions
###2608 seismographs records thousands of earthquake
###2612 one of the earthquake way revealed terrifying underground chambers
###2617 reappearance some info
###2619 at the land is rising
###2624 ultimate yellowstone geological questions remain to be answered
###2630 with the super bowl pinoy rock
###2632 once again
###2634 we know there is enough made me laugh we know there is enough he we know that
###2638 there will be
###2639 fieldtrip works in seeking your stuff
###2642 we don't know
###2643 fissile
###2644 e another tennis
###2646 straw for corruption
###2651 for the investigation
###2652 is left with a deadly serious warning
###2655 on the time scale the geologists works
###2659 coming super eruption in yellowstone may well be right around the corner
###2664 corner could be ten thousand
###2666 five hundred thousand years ago
###2672 devastating chapter
###2674 ever-changing store
###2676 how earth was made
