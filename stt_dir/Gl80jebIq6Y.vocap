###0 I have this propensity to want to crush things.
###3 So I want to show you what this demonstration looks like.
###5 [POPPING SOUNDS]
###6 Let's do the same thing that we just did, but this time the
###9 can is a little bit bigger.
###9 [EXPLODING SOUND]
###11 Bam!
###12 So I bet you think this is the part of the show where I'm
###14 going to say, don't try these experiments at home.
###16 And you're right.
###17 Except there is one experiment we want you to try.
###20 Just look for the graphic that's right here
###21 that says, Try It.
###22 That's your signal that you can try that
###24 experiment at home.
###25 Everything else, off limits.
###27 Look, I've already given you homework, and the show hasn't
###29 even started.
###30 
###33 Well, this is the answer to the age-old question, what do
###37 you do to crush that can?
###38 Because of course, you don't want to just
###40 sit here and do this.
###42 Expends so much energy.
###43 Why wouldn't you want to have this entire set up here just
###47 to accomplish the same thing.
###49 But there's nothing really cool about that.
###51 All right, so let's see if we can do it a different way.
###54 So here's what we have, is we have three cans here.
###57 In each of the cans, I have a small amount of water.
###60 Now, you could do this on a burner if you wanted to.
###62 In this particular case, because we're portable, we
###64 have this little camping stove thing.
###66 And so now, let's turn this on.
###68 
###70 So the object here is this, is we want to boil that water.
###74 So when you boil the water in the can, water when it boils,
###77 goes from a liquid into a gas.
###79 And when it does that, those little water molecules move
###81 about 1,700 times farther away from each other
###84 than they were before.
###85 In essence, we're turning it into water vapor.
###88 And you can see a little of the water vapor
###89 starting out here.
###91 What we're really trying to do is to push the
###93 air out of the can.
###94 This is a demonstration in air pressure.
###96 There's air pushing all around the can.
###98 If we're at sea level, it's 14.7 pounds per square inch.
###102 It's pushing all over the can.
###104 What we want, is we want to evacuate the can from the air,
###107 just leaving the water vapor.
###110 This is hot now, it's a gas.
###111 If we could cool it down very quickly by turning it upside
###114 down and putting it into water there, we might be able to
###116 allow the air pressure to crush the can.
###118 So, here's what happens.
###120 I'm going to grab my gloves so I can just kind of pick it up
###122 and hold onto it.
###124 You want a really, really good burn on these, so we really
###127 want to see a lot of the water vapor coming out so we get a
###130 good crush.
###131 All right.
###131 This is looking like it's got a pretty good burn on it.
###134 We've got water vapor coming out.
###135 Let's try this first one right here.
###137 So hold onto the can.
###138 Watch.
###138 Upside down.
###140 Nice.
###141 It's just the pressure of the air on the outside pushing
###145 against the can.
###145 Watch this one.
###146 Ready, watch.
###149 Bam.
###151 Finally, the last one here.
###151 Here's our tea.
###152 Look at this.
###155 Now when it happens, watch when we pick it up here.
###157 Look at how much water got pulled up inside of the can.
###160 No really, I should say how much water was pushed from the
###162 atmosphere down, and up inside the can.
###165 See, it's a much better way to crush a can.
###168 And it's so much easier, don't you think?
###171 I'm an idiot.
###173 I remember doing this years ago in a chemistry class.
###177 They had ditto fluid.
###178 So this was a metal can.
###180 So I've kept some of those cans over the years, it's just
###183 a matter of finding an empty can.
###185 The trick is not to use a can that had solvent in it because
###187 you don't want to cook the solvent.
###188 That could be a whole different experiment.
###190 
###196 I'm not a hoarder.
###198 Look, I just happen to have this from 20 years ago.
###202 This is perfect.
###204 It's exactly the can that we're looking for.
###207 So, we'll do the same thing.
###208 We'll put the water inside, then we'll cap the whole thing
###211 off and see if we can crush this can using that same kind
###215 of science style.
###217 
###220 See the boil that we have here.
###221 That's we want.
###222 We're pushing all of that air out, filling the space with
###227 water vapor.
###228 And we should just--
###230 it should be perfect.
###231 Ready?
###232 I think we're good.
###234 Let's turn it off.
###236 Cap this off like this.
###240 Set it here.
###241 And now watch.
###242 
###245 You can hear it actually talking to you.
###247 So unlike the soda can, it takes a little bit longer.
###249 
###255 Imagine all of that air and that surface area that's there
###258 with that air pressure pushing on the can.
###262 Let's see what happens if we cool it down just
###263 a little bit more.
###264 Watch.
###265 
###268 Perfect.
###271 This is good, but it's not the impact that I'm looking for.
###274 And now that we know how to crush it,
###276 let's just go bigger.
###277 
###280 I'm supposed to do TV this afternoon, so I have a regular
###283 nine news spot this afternoon, and instead of going down and
###286 doing an experiment, I convinced my producer to send
###288 a live truck to us.
###289 Since we're practicing it anyway, I think this looks
###291 totally cool and kind of a behind-the-scenes of getting
###293 ready to go do the Ellen show.
###295 So it just puts a little bit more pressure on making sure
###298 this dumb thing works.
###299 And I've got two hours to make this happen.
###301 With live TV, I mean, there's no editing.
###303 So I've got to have it crush in under 60 seconds because
###307 there's just not too much that I can do to sit there and talk
###309 it through.
###310 So, cross your fingers.
###314 This will be much better.
###315 It's a 55 gallon drum.
###317 We got six of them just to practice with today because we
###319 just got to make sure that we've got the timing down.
###322 Take a look at the construction of the drum, this
###324 is really important.
###325 Notice it's sealed all the way around, so it's not one that
###327 has a clamp down.
###329 And there's two little places that could open up.
###333 This one here is going to remain closed.
###335 We put the water in this one.
###336 So from practice, we know about 4 liters--
###339 close to a gallon of water--
###340 will go in.
###341 That's going to go up on a great big, huge turkey--
###345 I don't know, a turkey oven, you know what I'm talking
###347 about, that you boil the oil for a turkey at Thanksgiving.
###350 So that's going to boil this pretty fast.
###352 So we've got a propane tank off to the side.
###354 Once we have that boiling, that should be pretty good.
###357 And we can do that kind of ahead of time and then kind of
###359 wheel that out when we have to on stage.
###362 The real problem is, I know this is going to work--
###365 I mean look at this, it's going to crush--
###368 but I need to do this.
###369 I need to have maximum implosion, and also I have to
###373 do it within a certain period of time because they can't
###375 wait like for four or five minutes.
###376 So that's where these kind of come in.
###379 I think what we'll do is we'll take ice water and fill the
###381 four buckets with ice water.
###382 So slowly, we can kind of pour those over them like this.
###386 Hopefully we can cool it faster.
###387 We've got to catch everything, so follow me over here.
###392 A handy dandy kids swimming pool should be perfect.
###395 So the set up will look something like this.
###397 We'll throw the swimming pool here.
###399 Got it.
###399 We'll fill that with three, four inches of water.
###403 We'll put ice in there so it's nice and cold.
###405 Then we'll heat this up, boil it away, we'll find a couple
###408 rods here like this.
###411 Jeff and I will grab it on either end, we'll pick this
###414 up, set it in there, and then the stopwatch starts.
###416 I need a crush within 60 seconds.
###418 We really just can't edit around 60 seconds.
###420 So if I can do it within 60 seconds, it'll be perfect.
###424 We'll see if it happens.
###425 
###429 This will give us more than enough to boil away, and
###431 again, the entire trick here is to be able to get it to
###434 boil, and to get all that water vapor kind of coming
###437 out, push all the air out.
###438 We've got to get a really good, rapid boil on it.
###441 We can do all that backstage or kind of behind the scenes,
###443 so I'm not worried about that.
###444 It's from the moment that we cap off the lid and go, that's
###447 when the clock starts ticking.
###449 See, and the situation is this.
###450 If you need some water, why wouldn't you just go and get a
###453 forklift first.
###454 So if you want to try this at home, get a
###455 forklift, number one.
###457 Number two, get a great big huge pool like this.
###459 Don't use this empty one that's here and just like a
###461 hose that you could put into it.
###463 No.
###463 Move it in with a forklift.
###464 
###468 And then, hire a union guy like this to go ahead and just
###471 kind of put it in place.
###473 This is perfect.
###474 Why couldn't you recreate this at home.
###476 And I would expect that you would be doing that.
###478 
###486 Nice.
###487 All right, see the water vapor coming up here.
###489 You know, the steam.
###490 You can't be fooled by that small amount that's coming up.
###493 We need, for this 55 gallon drum, a great rumble inside.
###496 So we need a lot coming out.
###498 So, we'll see this increase.
###499 Again, it's pushing all the air out, and it'll be perfect
###503 when we cap it off.
###504 We got to get it burning more.
###505 
###511 See the rumble that we have here?
###512 That's kind of the volume that we're looking for,
###514 consistently coming out.
###516 I think we're right there.
###518 So we're going to turn the burner off, then we're going
###520 to put the cap on, and get it over onto the side.
###522 He's got the tight cap because we don't want any of that air
###525 coming back in again.
###527 Just going to grab the edges here, we're going to pick it
###529 up, ready, put it in.
###534 Good.
###535 Now it's starting to cool down.
###536 Somebody needs to start the timer.
###537 
###542 Let's tip it over.
###543 
###556 See, this should do it with no problem at all.
###558 
###562 I think we try another drum.
###563 We'll pull this out, we'll try another drum.
###567 OK.
###568 
###571 I don't know.
###572 
###577 [SMASHING SOUND]
###583 That was awesome.
###585 All right.
###585 Well, that worked.
###588 It just took a little baseball bat hit, we crushed the can.
###593 Unfortunately, we can't do that.
###597 That's not the whole idea here, but maybe it's just--
###600 oh my gosh, look at this.
###602 God, that's amazing, look at that.
###604 
###610 Now it's my job to start the 55 gallon drum graveyard.
###627 One down, six to go.
###629 
###632 All right, so here's where we are now.
###633 We're at 200 degrees with this thermometer, that's just
###636 surface temperature.
###637 We started with two gallons of water, we're getting a really
###639 good roll here.
###640 Let's use this as a benchmark and see if it works.
###644 Start the clock.
###645 
###650 Yes, let's do it.
###652 OK, so the trick here is to cool it down
###654 as much as we can.
###658 Hear it talking?
###659 
###665 That's not the implosion that I wanted, so it's a happy
###668 in-between.
###668 So it's either we cooled it too fast.
###671 And we want that implosion.
###672 So the next one I think we do, is pour a little bit of water
###676 on it, but just let it sit and see what
###678 happens with the implosion.
###680 Put it in.
###682 Start the clock.
###683 
###697 Nice.
###697 Time?
###699 40 seconds.
###701 Even when you were that close, it was OK.
###704 All right, we're going for maximum implosion this time,
###707 and so we've cooked this off.
###709 It's sitting here at about the 10 minute mark
###710 where we were before.
###711 Same amount of water.
###713 This time we're going to put it in the ice bath, we're not
###716 going to pour anything on top of it and see if it will crush
###718 within the first 60 seconds.
###719 If not, then we're going to pour slightly and see--
###723 right now, I know that it will crush, I just want a good
###724 implosion to scare the audience.
###727 I mean to get them excited about the whole process.
###729 Who am I kidding, I want to scare the crap out of them.
###731 
###738 Getting closer, and closer, and closer.
###740 And you can hear the can starting to crinkle just a
###742 little bit.
###743 It's crinkling.
###744 It's even talking to you.
###745 The hard part is--
###747 the hard part is you have no idea when--
###748 [EXPLODING SOUND]
###749 Bam!
###751 That was a good one!
###752 All right.
###754 Isn't that awesome!
###755 
###757 [EXPLODING SOUND]
###758 Bam!
###759 
###762 [EXPLODING SOUND]
###767 That's how to crush a can.
###770 All right, so with this particular can, here's what we
###773 could have figured out.
###774 We had too much water to start with.
###775 We weren't getting the boil that we really needed, so
###778 fixed that problem.
###780 No problem with capping it off, that wasn't a problem.
###783 We thought maybe we had to have the water colder, that
###785 wasn't a problem.
###786 We just have to trust that it's going to happen.
###787 So, pouring just a little bit of water on the top starts
###790 that whole process of cooling.
###791 Those molecules are 1,700 times further away from each
###795 other than they were before.
###796 And funny that outside pressure
###798 wins as the can collapses.
###801 Looks pretty good.
