THOMAS MORTON: Yugoslavia is
best known as that big, goofy


4
0:0:21,37 --> 0:0:23,51
country from the '70s that
turned into six little


5
0:0:23,51 --> 0:0:26,2
countries in the '90s
amid an orgy of rape


6
0:0:26,2 --> 0:0:28,5
and nightmare war.


7
0:0:28,5 --> 0:0:30,42
The breakup of Yugoslavia led
to a period of such heinous


8
0:0:30,42 --> 0:0:32,96
interethnic violence, including
acts of outright


9
0:0:32,96 --> 0:0:35,41
genocide, it seemed amazing that
they had ever been able


10
0:0:35,41 --> 0:0:39,24
to live together
in first place.


11
0:0:39,24 --> 0:0:42,64
At the end of World War II,
Josip Marshal Tito Broz united


12
0:0:42,64 --> 0:0:44,91
the six Balkan republics into
a massive socialist


13
0:0:44,91 --> 0:0:48,29
federation, despite the fact
that, historically, they all


14
0:0:48,29 --> 0:0:50,5
wanted to kill each other.


15
0:0:50,5 --> 0:0:53,25
When Tito died, the old ethnic
tensions reawoke and the


16
0:0:53,25 --> 0:0:54,94
republic started
to break away--


17
0:0:54,94 --> 0:0:59,15
first Slovenia, then Macedonia,
then Croatia, then


18
0:0:59,15 --> 0:1:2,75
Bosnia, and eventually
Montenegro, leaving Serbia the


19
0:1:2,75 --> 0:1:6,31
last republic to carry the torch
for the old Yugoslavia.


20
0:1:6,31 --> 0:1:8,68
Oh yeah, Kosovo broke
away too, if you


21
0:1:8,68 --> 0:1:10,38
consider that a country.


22
0:1:10,38 --> 0:1:12,85
It's been 10 years since the end
of the wars, and since the


23
0:1:12,85 --> 0:1:15,37
man widely considered their
architect, Serbian president


24
0:1:15,37 --> 0:1:18,88
Slobodan Milosevic, was
bulldozed out of office.


25
0:1:18,88 --> 0:1:21,3
All the former Yugoslav
republics have now applied for


26
0:1:21,3 --> 0:1:22,73
membership in the
European Union.


27
0:1:22,73 --> 0:1:25,6
At the same time, the Balkans is
still a byword for barbaric


28
0:1:25,6 --> 0:1:28,12
acts of violence, and the entire
region occupies a sort


29
0:1:28,12 --> 0:1:31,56
of threshold state between
Europe and, well, not-Europe.


30
0:1:31,56 --> 0:1:33,87
So we went to the Balkans to
find out once and for all if


31
0:1:33,87 --> 0:1:36,47
Yugoslavians are just like
you-and-me-goslavians.

THOMAS MORTON: Hey,
it's Thomas.


36
0:2:14,98 --> 0:2:17,9
We're in Yugoslavia-- or former
Yugoslavia, I'm sorry.


37
0:2:17,9 --> 0:2:18,655
We're in Serbia right now.


38
0:2:18,655 --> 0:2:22,46
We rented an old Yugo
for this trip.


39
0:2:22,46 --> 0:2:26,68
I don't think we realize quite
how old it would be.


40
0:2:26,68 --> 0:2:31,2
We're going about 100 K right
now-- so maybe 60-- and the


41
0:2:31,2 --> 0:2:32,42
car's rattling.


42
0:2:32,42 --> 0:2:36,172
It's almost like being in
a moving massage chair.


43
0:2:36,172 --> 0:2:38,77
It's holding up pretty well
except that the fuel gauge is


44
0:2:38,77 --> 0:2:41,755
literally doing this, so
we have to guess when


45
0:2:41,755 --> 0:2:43,49
we're out of gas.


46
0:2:43,49 --> 0:2:48,45
And me and the passenger
seatbelts are tied together.


47
0:2:48,45 --> 0:2:49,78
I forgot about that.


48
0:2:49,78 --> 0:2:54,1



49
0:2:54,1 --> 0:2:57,34
So we're going to Yugoland, and
that's a kind of a farm


50
0:2:57,34 --> 0:2:59,498
mixed with an amusement park.


51
0:2:59,498 --> 0:3:4,95
But it's supposed to capture the
memory of Marshal Tito's


52
0:3:4,95 --> 0:3:6,41
Yugoslavia.


53
0:3:6,41 --> 0:3:8,47
Tell you one thing about
Yugoland, they don't


54
0:3:8,47 --> 0:3:10,798
advertise very well.


55
0:3:10,798 --> 0:3:13,73
There were no signs on
the highway for it.


56
0:3:13,73 --> 0:3:18,92
And it is in the middle of a
very, very, very tiny village.


57
0:3:18,92 --> 0:3:21,89
Yugoland's website advertises it
as a full service amusement


58
0:3:21,89 --> 0:3:24,925
park in northern Serbia, based
on the former Yugoslavia.


59
0:3:24,925 --> 0:3:27,17
It has different sections for
each of the old constituent


60
0:3:27,17 --> 0:3:30,57
republics, except for Kosovo, so
we couldn't think of a more


61
0:3:30,57 --> 0:3:32,88
perfect place to get oriented
for a road trip through the


62
0:3:32,88 --> 0:3:34,23
scattered remnants of
old Yugoslavia.


63
0:3:34,23 --> 0:3:42,414



64
0:3:42,414 --> 0:3:43,54
So this is Yugoland.


65
0:3:43,54 --> 0:3:45,412
It looks like it's kind
of in the backyard


66
0:3:45,412 --> 0:3:47,622
of someone's house.


67
0:3:47,622 --> 0:3:51,144
I think we might have missed
most of the action.


68
0:3:51,144 --> 0:3:53,31
This might be the [INAUDIBLE]
committee.


69
0:3:53,31 --> 0:3:56,83
Sounds like stuff's still going
on in the background.


70
0:3:56,83 --> 0:3:58,47
Yugoland seemed pleasant
enough, if


71
0:3:58,47 --> 0:4:2,2
a bit old and rustic.


72
0:4:2,2 --> 0:4:8,92
Not a lot of teenagers so far,
nor a lot of ladies.


73
0:4:8,92 --> 0:4:15,61



74
0:4:15,61 --> 0:4:19,36
Blasko Gabric is Yugoland's
founder, a Serbian printmaker

0:4:19,36 --> 0:4:23,5
turned Canadian turned eventual
Yugoslavian superfan,


76
0:4:23,5 --> 0:4:25,36

of the region refer to as


77
0:4:25,36 --> 0:4:26,61
quite a character.

THOMAS MORTON: Pretty
good, yeah.


81
0:4:46,847 --> 0:5:7,925



82
0:5:7,925 --> 0:5:9,8
THOMAS MORTON: Yugoland turned
out to be less of an amusement


83
0:5:9,8 --> 0:5:12,9
park than a park park, and
really less of that than a


84
0:5:12,9 --> 0:5:15,45
yard with some picnic tables and
a lot of tipsy Serbians.


85
0:5:15,45 --> 0:5:18,72
Nevertheless, its amenities
include a bandstand, soccer


86
0:5:18,72 --> 0:5:21,27
fields, a reflecting pool in
the shape of the Croatian


87
0:5:21,27 --> 0:5:24,4
coastline, and a scale model of
Slovenia's Mount Triglav.


88
0:5:24,4 --> 0:5:38,62



89
0:5:38,62 --> 0:5:40,31
THOMAS MORTON: The most
important amenity, however, is


90
0:5:40,31 --> 0:5:43,0
a fervent and unconditional
love for Yugoslavia's late


91
0:5:43,0 --> 0:5:44,76
partisan leader, Marshal Tito.


92
0:5:44,76 --> 0:6:3,8



93
0:6:3,8 --> 0:6:5,86
THOMAS MORTON: Marshal Tito's
extremely beloved for a dead


94
0:6:5,86 --> 0:6:7,16
Communist dictator.


95
0:6:7,16 --> 0:6:9,19
Even coming from an American
perspective, I always had a


96
0:6:9,19 --> 0:6:11,7
pretty vaunted impression
of him.


97
0:6:11,7 --> 0:6:13,785
He was like the dictator
who cares--


98
0:6:13,785 --> 0:6:16,74
minimal human rights violations,
genuine popular


99
0:6:16,74 --> 0:6:19,515
support, and he was one of the
only Communists with the balls


100
0:6:19,515 --> 0:6:22,31
to tell Stalin where to smoke
it-- or where to stuff it,


101
0:6:22,31 --> 0:6:23,73
however that saying goes--


102
0:6:23,73 --> 0:6:27,115
and on top of that, he fucked
Elizabeth Taylor, probably.


103
0:6:27,115 --> 0:6:30,59
So all in all, not a terrible
guy to worship.


104
0:6:30,59 --> 0:6:33,53
The guest of honor at Yugoland
was here as Tito's grandson,


105
0:6:33,53 --> 0:6:35,55
though we get the feeling the
family charm may have skipped


106
0:6:35,55 --> 0:6:36,8
a couple generations.

real who's who.

0:7:40,57 --> 0:7:41,86
US president anywhere here?


116

BLASKO GABRIC: No.


117
0:7:42,1 --> 0:7:42,455
THOMAS MORTON: Carter?


118
0:7:42,455 --> 0:7:43,82
Or was it Reagan
by that point?


119
0:7:43,82 --> 0:7:45,7
BLASKO GABRIC: No.


120
0:7:45,7 --> 0:7:47,41
THOMAS MORTON: Oh,
there's Thatcher.


121
0:7:47,41 --> 0:7:48,66
THOMAS MORTON: She's
somewhere.

0:7:48,66 --> 0:7:52,83



123
0:7:52,83 --> 0:7:57,29

had a pretty big funeral.

125
0:8:38,46 --> 0:8:39,71

yeah, a bunch.


126
0:8:39,71 --> 0:8:54,13



127

THOMAS MORTON: Yugoland's
a pretty


128
0:8:55,26 --> 0:8:57,13
harmless exercise in nostalgia.


129
0:8:57,13 --> 0:8:59,545
What's creepy, though, is the
part where it's mostly Serbs


130
0:8:59,545 --> 0:9:2,35
getting together in Serbia to
celebrate their Yugoslav


131
0:9:2,35 --> 0:9:5,32
history, all while neatly
stepping over the decade their


132
0:9:5,32 --> 0:9:7,945
country spent committing war
crimes on Bosnia and Croatia


133
0:9:7,945 --> 0:9:9,63
and Kosovo.


134
0:9:9,63 --> 0:9:11,995
You also have to remember that
during the '90s, when the wars


135
0:9:11,995 --> 0:9:14,54
were going on and Blasko was
just getting into his


136
0:9:14,54 --> 0:9:17,69

was still Yugoslavia--


137
0:9:17,69 --> 0:9:21,35

138
0:9:21,35 --> 0:9:22,6
Go, Yugoslavia.


139
0:9:22,6 --> 0:9:27,642



140
0:9:27,642 --> 0:9:30,3
While the Yugolanders sort of
represent the feelgood version


141
0:9:30,3 --> 0:9:32,51
of the Balkans' past,
basically retreading


142
0:9:32,51 --> 0:9:36,26
decades-old national propaganda
ad nauseum, another


143
0:9:36,26 --> 0:9:38,25
group of Serbs have been
barreling into the future with


144
0:9:38,25 --> 0:9:40,39
a trunk full of smuggled
drugs, the


145
0:9:40,39 --> 0:9:41,76
