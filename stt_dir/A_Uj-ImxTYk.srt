bjbjLULU JEFFREY BROWN: Hari Sreenivasan takes
the story from there. HARI SREENIVASAN: Just


2
0:0:6,749 --> 0:0:11,98
what are the consequences of such explosive
growth? The PBS NewsHour, in partnership with


3
0:0:11,98 --> 0:0:16,309
the Pulitzer Center and National Geographic,
has been covering that for the past year.


4
0:0:16,309 --> 0:0:21,81
We have explored how the composition of our
society is changing. We are becoming a more


5
0:0:21,81 --> 0:0:26,66
urban population. Mega-cities, those with
more than 10 million residents, are booming.


6
0:0:26,66 --> 0:0:32,98
In 1975, there were only three such places.
Now there are more than 21. Fred de Sam Lazaro


7
0:0:32,98 --> 0:0:37,12
reported from New Delhi last December. FRED
DE SAM LAZARO: Jyoti Sharma, a conservation


8
0:0:37,12 --> 0:0:42,3
activist who runs a small aid agency, says
the city is simply overwhelmed. JYOTI SHARMA,


9
0:0:42,3 --> 0:0:47,649
water activist: Every year, we get an additional
.5 to .7 million people. That's the net addition


10
0:0:47,649 --> 0:0:50,67
to the city. FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Seven hundred
thousand people every year? JYOTI SHARMA:


11
0:0:50,67 --> 0:0:55,51
Seven hundred thousand people, yes. A majority
of this growth is of people who are poor.


12
0:0:55,51 --> 0:0:59,789
And they typically come and settle in these
kind of settlements. Only 27 percent of the


13
0:0:59,789 --> 0:1:4,86
city is actually a planned city. The rest
of it has just grown like this. And you cannot


14
0:1:4,86 --> 0:1:8,56
stop them from coming, because that's the
only place they will get some livelihood from.


15
0:1:8,56 --> 0:1:13,59
HARI SREENIVASAN: Babies born today enter
a world where 13 percent of the population


16
0:1:13,59 --> 0:1:18,92
doesn't have access to clean drinking water.
That was the subject of Steve Sapienza's report


17
0:1:18,92 --> 0:1:23,3
in march from Dhaka, Bangladesh. STEVE SAPIENZA:
If you want to see the human toll exacted


18
0:1:23,3 --> 0:1:29,45
by unsafe water and poor sanitation in Dhaka,
you come here. This is the overflow tent at


19
0:1:29,45 --> 0:1:35,57
the short-stay unit at Dhaka's main cholera
and diarrhea hospital. This man arrived at


20
0:1:35,57 --> 0:1:40,61
the hospital with no vital signs. After 15
minutes of trying to revive him, his wife


21
0:1:40,61 --> 0:1:47,0
is given the news. The staff reports cholera
as the cause of death. HARI SREENIVASAN: But


22
0:1:47,0 --> 0:1:53,6
while the overall number continues to rise,
in places like Brazil, family sizes are shrinking.


23
0:1:53,6 --> 0:1:57,6
In August, Fred de Sam Lazaro outlined some
of the forces changing fertility rates there.


24
0:1:57,6 --> 0:2:1,57
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Eighty percent of women
of childbearing age use contraception. At


25
0:2:1,57 --> 0:2:7,2
the same time, a robust economy has needed
their labor. Today, women make up 40 percent


26
0:2:7,2 --> 0:2:13,11
of the country's work force up and down the
economic ladder. The majority of college graduates


27
0:2:13,11 --> 0:2:17,56
in Brazil are women. HARI SREENIVASAN: To
see many more images, you can download the


28
0:2:17,56 --> 0:2:22,68
National Geographic 7 Billion app for the
iPad. For more now on what a seven billion-person


29
0:2:22,68 --> 0:2:27,81
world might mean, we are joined by Azza Karam,
a senior adviser at the U.N.'s Population


30
0:2:27,81 --> 0:2:32,2
Fund, and Dennis Dimick. He is the executive
editor of environment at National Geographic


31
0:2:32,2 --> 0:2:36,42
magazine, our partner in world population
coverage. So, Dennis, let me start with you.


32
0:2:36,42 --> 0:2:40,78
What are the implications of a 7 billion-person
world? You have been looking at these stories


33
0:2:40,78 --> 0:2:43,57
all year. DENNIS DIMICK, National Geographic
magazine: Well, I think the idea that 7 billion


34
0:2:43,57 --> 0:2:49,6
is really just a spot on a trajectory that
we're all on. And if it's laid out, we were


35
0:2:49,6 --> 0:2:55,6
at 6 billion just a few years ago, and by
2025, we will be at 8 billion. So, really,


36
0:2:55,6 --> 0:2:59,48
what it is, it really gives us an opportunity
not so much just to talk about 7 billion,


37
0:2:59,48 --> 0:3:4,76
but what does that mean and what are the kind
of challenges that we all face as we go forward


38
0:3:4,76 --> 0:3:10,1
to try to fulfill the needs of everybody on
the planet? HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, Azza Karam,


39
0:3:10,1 --> 0:3:14,68
it's a nice round number that gets our attention.
So now you have it. What should we be focused


40
0:3:14,68 --> 0:3:18,29
on? AZZA KARAM, United Nations Population
Fund: We should be focused both on the challenges


41
0:3:18,29 --> 0:3:23,21
that this represents, as well as on the opportunities,
because there is no way that it is only a


42
0:3:23,21 --> 0:3:28,68
litany of challenges. It certainly is a matter
of access to resources. More people means


43
0:3:28,68 --> 0:3:33,9
more pressure on already rare resources, from
the air we breathe, the water we drink, the


44
0:3:33,9 --> 0:3:41,81
food we eat. It literally is a great deal
more demand than there may well be supply.


45
0:3:41,81 --> 0:3:46,819
But at the same time, we have to balance that
perspective by looking at the opportunities


46
0:3:46,819 --> 0:3:54,97
that 7 billion presents in terms of the most
amazing amount of human power that this Earth


47
0:3:54,97 --> 0:4:1,98
has ever seen, and especially given the technology
that is being evolving as we speak, especially


48
0:4:1,98 --> 0:4:6,87
communication technologies, but also the technologies
of the better use of resources that we're


49
0:4:6,87 --> 0:4:14,75
all trying to harvest. The fact that there
will be 1.8 billion of that 7 billion is young


50
0:4:14,75 --> 0:4:21,45
people, which is a remarkable potential, as
we're seeing every day unfold in terms its


51
0:4:21,45 --> 0:4:27,78
of new strategies for seeking demand. And
one of the challenges and also an opportunity


52
0:4:27,78 --> 0:4:33,139
is the fact that we have a lot more women
who will be hard-pressed as heads of households


53
0:4:33,139 --> 0:4:38,68
to make ends meet, but, at the same time,
a lot more women in the labor force who are


54
0:4:38,68 --> 0:4:42,72
in positions of decision-making. So I think
we need to make sure we keep that balanced


55
0:4:42,72 --> 0:4:46,83
perspective all the time. HARI SREENIVASAN:
Dennis, as one of the stories we profiled


56
0:4:46,83 --> 0:4:52,419
showed, the rate of population growth isn't
the same all over the world. In fact, the


57
0:4:52,419 --> 0:4:58,12
U.N. says that 42 percent of the population
on Earth is not replacing itself generation


58
0:4:58,12 --> 0:5:1,65
after generation -- 40 percent is and maybe
a little bit more. And then there is another


59
0:5:1,65 --> 0:5:6,49
18 percent that's rapidly growing. What are
these disparities about? DENNIS DIMICK: So,


60
0:5:6,49 --> 0:5:11,8
what we see in large measure is, in northern
latitude countries -- in fact, we're seeing


61
0:5:11,8 --> 0:5:15,889
-- across Europe and Japan, we're actually
seeing a fertility rate -- that's the number


62
0:5:15,889 --> 0:5:20,889
of children born per women that reach childbearing
age -- is actually less than replacement.


63
0:5:20,889 --> 0:5:26,8
And so we are seeing aging populations across
Europe and in Japan. So we don't have the


64
0:5:26,8 --> 0:5:31,72
young people coming into the society that
do things like work and pay the taxes and


65
0:5:31,72 --> 0:5:38,11
help pay for the pensions, for example. And
then in, largely in southern countries, for


66
0:5:38,11 --> 0:5:43,169
example, most of the largest potential growth
we're going to see is in Africa and in Southern


67
0:5:43,169 --> 0:5:48,84
Asia, where the populations are getting younger.
HARI SREENIVASAN: Ms. Karam, what does it


68
0:5:48,84 --> 0:5:53,639
mean when we have these sort of lopsided societies,
when certain countries are going to have much


69
0:5:53,639 --> 0:5:59,1
older populations without the young to support
them? AZZA KARAM: Well, it basically means


70
0:5:59,1 --> 0:6:4,449
what we're seeing evolve right now, which
is migration patterns from the areas where


71
0:6:4,449 --> 0:6:8,729
there seems to be too many people, if one
can say that, to areas where there is obviously


72
0:6:8,729 --> 0:6:14,57
a need for labor, because there is a serious
shortage of that labor. That is only one of


73
0:6:14,57 --> 0:6:20,62
many implications, which is this migration
trend. You are also going to see different


74
0:6:20,62 --> 0:6:27,71
kinds of pressures being exerted by governments,
unfortunately, on women to either try to encourage


75
0:6:27,71 --> 0:6:34,27
them to have more children. But what is infinitely
more effective, I think -- and that's one


76
0:6:34,27 --> 0:6:39,16
of the reasons why the United Nations Population
Fund has been leading a 7 Billion Actions


77
0:6:39,16 --> 0:6:45,19
campaign globally -- what is a great deal
more effective is to show how women can become


78
0:6:45,19 --> 0:6:50,889
very important agents of change in their societies.
But in order to do so, they need access to


79
0:6:50,889 --> 0:6:56,84
good health care, access to education, equitable
access to all kinds of resources. But we also


80
0:6:56,84 --> 0:7:2,5
know that investing in health care, especially
maternal health and education about sexuality


81
0:7:2,5 --> 0:7:8,27
and reproductive health, can be -- can save
lives and it can save a great deal of money.


82
0:7:8,27 --> 0:7:12,25
So it's very cost-effective to do this. HARI
SREENIVASAN: Dennis, on your site, there's


83
0:7:12,25 --> 0:7:17,28
a story that says a baby born today in the
U.S. or perhaps in a Western nation has a


84
0:7:17,28 --> 0:7:23,29
50/50 chance of living to be 100 years old.
What sorts of resource strains -- or what


85
0:7:23,29 --> 0:7:27,79
sorts of resources do we have to have to sustain
a population that can live that long? DENNIS


86
0:7:27,79 --> 0:7:31,66
DIMICK: Well, I think that's one point that
we have tried to make in our series, also,


87
0:7:31,66 --> 0:7:36,8
is that this discussion of population is really
not just about numbers of people, but it's


88
0:7:36,8 --> 0:7:42,44
also the resources that each of us use. And
if you look in the United States, for example,


89
0:7:42,44 --> 0:7:48,85
we use many, many times much more resources
per person than say a person in Bangladesh


90
0:7:48,85 --> 0:7:54,4
or other country that doesn't have advantage
of, say, things like electricity. A quarter


91
0:7:54,4 --> 0:7:59,759
of the world's population doesn't even have
electricity, like we take advantage of every


92
0:7:59,759 --> 0:8:4,69
day. HARI SREENIVASAN: Ms. Karam, what are
those correlations that you're seeing between


93
0:8:4,69 --> 0:8:9,669
the levels of education for a woman and the
population growth in those countries? AZZA


94
0:8:9,669 --> 0:8:15,78
KARAM: Well, we know for a fact that the statistics
indicate that women who have more access to


95
0:8:15,78 --> 0:8:21,53
population and who are better educated are
actually women who choose to have smaller


96
0:8:21,53 --> 0:8:27,86
families, certainly smaller compared to generations
before them. So there is a very strong correlation


97
0:8:27,86 --> 0:8:35,179
between education and choosing or the ability
to make choices about the size and the number


98
0:8:35,179 --> 0:8:39,399
of our families. But there's an even more
important point I think that we have to make,


99
0:8:39,399 --> 0:8:47,89
which is that, effectively, there are over
200 million women who would want to have access


100
0:8:47,89 --> 0:8:52,91
to family planning facilities and care and
who cannot have that access. And one of the


101
0:8:52,91 --> 0:8:58,779
things that the United Nations Population
Fund and many partners around the world is


102
0:8:58,779 --> 0:9:3,529
engaging in is trying to ensure that there
is an awareness that we have to make sure


103
0:9:3,529 --> 0:9:10,92
that not only knowledge and education, but
also access and information about family planning


104
0:9:10,92 --> 0:9:16,119
and reproductive health care and access to
services, all manner of reproductive health


105
0:9:16,119 --> 0:9:21,41
services, needs to be made available for women
around the world and for families. HARI SREENIVASAN:


106
0:9:21,41 --> 0:9:25,569
All right. Azza Karam from the United Nations
