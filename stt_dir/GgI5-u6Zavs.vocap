###1 Anyone watching thinking we know fuck all about knowing fuck all
###5 about owt, needs to watch their back...
###8 So you've had your Labour, reclassifying skunk,
###11 sending prices sky-high,
###13 literally, literally taking the grass from its own roots!
###17 And now you've got your ConDemNation,
###19 Liberals noshing Tories like altar boys picking dimps up!
###23 Have we had a national fucking stroke... or what?
###27 Is revolution a word or was it never?
###31 Anybody watching, needs to know, we cope better than average
###34 with irony in Chatsworth.
###36 Well, for fuck's sake, we live in Manchester and they charge us
###41 for water!
###43 I wandered lonely as a clown, necking mushrooms rarely found...
###48 This green and pleasant land in ancient times...
###51 Yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak!
###53 It's not theirs any more.
###57 This is our England now!
###59 Paaaarty!
###62 Contains strong language, scenes of a sexual nature and some violence.
###70 The first throes of love are all about passion.
###74 Eyes, hands, lips, limbs, kisses,
###78 I love yous and promises of never-ending devotion.
###82 Burning to memory every nook and cranny of that face,
###87 that body, drowning in each other, getting your fill,
###91 getting more than your fill, that thirst
###93 you can never really quench, no matter how much you try.
###97 And fuck knows we try, don't we?
###100 'I read in some mag, in a waiting room years back, that...
###104 'if you put a coin in a jar every time you made love in the first
###108 'three years of your relationship, then took one out every time
###111 'you did it after three years... '
###113 Yeah, yeah!
###115 '..you'd never ever, ever, ever... '
###118 Yeah, yeah!
###120 '..be able to empty it.'
###121 Oh!
###142 Cum again and soon.
###145 Not too soon though, eh, Tiger?
###147 Give me some time to recover.
###153 Dickhead.
###154 He's tipped you?
###155 He thinks he made me cum.
###156 Screams were almost convincing.
###157 The yelps helped.
###159 I had cramp. Came in handy.
###161 I can spot a fake a mile off.
###163 Well, I guess you've pulled a few in your time.
###165 Didn't need to.
###167 My Brendan were gifted in the trouser department.
###169 When he stripped off put me in mind of a tripod.
###173 Any chance of you finishing early?
###175 We've got a stag do in any minute now. I'd leave the girls to it
###178 but we need all hands on deck for this one.
###180 Lillian just took a call and the lads've been chewing Viagra
###183 since they left Burnley.
###185 They won't walk in, they'll be pole vaulting.
###188 No worries. I'll catch you later then, OK?
###192 He knows... that you're lying.
###194 Orgasms aren't the only thing I'm good at faking.
###197 He hasn't got a clue.
###200 Don't know what's wrong with her lately.
###201 I do.
###208 It's too small.
###209 It'll keep the wind off your back.
###211 Yeah and give me twatting frostbite at the front.
###215 I'll look like a fucking nutter.
###218 But you are a fucking nutter.
###219 Take no notice.
###221 Beggars can't be choosers.
###224 As soon as you get a few bob rolling in, it's me and you
###227 straight down to Primani for a proper makeover.
###229 But until then, it's our Shane's cast-offs.
###231 It suits you.
###232 Yeah, it looks... nice.
###234 It's pink and it smells of perfume.
###236 Only real men can wear pink. And it's aftershave that.
###239 This is a bird's fluffy jumper.
###241 Angora. He's allergic to manmade.
###243 It's got tit shapes in it.
###245 Must've been me mam's.
###247 You need to try it on.
###256 You look lovely.
###258 None of it fits! Right?
###261 I can't survive much longer
###262 on two pairs of socks, three T-shirts and a pair of undies.
###265 Just one pair?
###268 Oh, I wish I'd known that sooner.
###271 I'm only on a tea break.
###274 Laters.
###278 Look, just go commando whilst they wash and dry.
###281 Eh... ready for action.
###282 Homo! Sorry.
###284 I can't, I'll chafe.
###292 It was only going go on a bottle of baby oil and some poppers.
###300 You've been a pal to me, Micky.
###301 And if I were queer, I'd bum you here and now.
###304 Thanks, Marty.
###307 You're going to make someone a lovely wife... partner one day.
###311 But I've got to stand up on my own two feet.
###313 I need cash, so I'll have to do a job.
###317 Get a job.
###322 Everybody get down!
###325 Shut up. Shut your...
###326 This is a fuck up!
###328 Shut the fuck up... this is a stick up!
###330 Rectal prolapse!
###333 Gimme the money, gimme the money!
###339 Evil...!
###341 Fuck off!
###346 Sit down, wait till you see this. It's class!
###349 Come on, you're in my seat.
###353 Soon have you smiling again, girl!
###363 Isn't that the shittest...
###365 crappest robber you have ever seen?
###368 How much did he get away with?
###370 Enough for some chips and a taxi home!
###372 Fucking shame of it!
###386 You know who that was?
###390 You know.
###391 I don't know.
###393 So... why don't you tell me?
###396 Marty.
###397 How'd you know?
###398 He was wearing my old coat.
###400 Not his style, is it? Armed robbery, not the coat.
###402 I don't his fucking style.
###404 It's only a matter of time before the filth get their shit together
###407 and clock it's him.
###410 And? Arrest him.
###412 You're not arsed?
###413 He's a punter, Shane.
###415 Offering ten-grand reward for somebody to grass him up.
###418 If he's daft enough to threaten people with a gun,
###421 he deserves grassing up.
###423 It's deposit on a house that, you know, ten grand.
###424 Maguires don't grass.
###432 Fucking stupid though, weren't it?
###434 He is fucking stupid.
###437 Aren't you?!
###439 I said aren't you!?
###440 What the fuck was I supposed to do?
###443 I'm here, skint, I can't work, I can't sign on.
###445 What, in case the police catch you
###447 for non-payment of maintenance, you mean?
###450 As opposed to armed fucking robbery, you gormless twat!
###454 I needed money!
###455 Then ask!
###457 Don't go holding up Post Offices with fucking guns!
###460 You could've killed someone,
###462 some poor bastard collecting their pension.
###465 You could've got killed yourself and then what would I have done?!
###472 I mean, how would I have explained that to Sue?
###475 Where'd you get the gun?
###479 They're stashed here! It's family stuff, you know the score, Kel!
###482 You keep him away from guns, you got that? Guns and fucking matches!
###486 Sorry!
###487 It could bring a load of trouble and...
###490 We've had enough... That... that gun,
###493 could be linked to Shane, maybe and they'll...
###509 You're looking lovely.
###512 You do, you look dead nice, like. Nice.
###515 Proper like... glowing,
###518 healthily.
###520 I was thinking... do you want me to make tea tonight?
###523 What's going on?
###524 Why would anything be going on?
###526 I was married longer than you've been alive.
###528 And I know that when a man's buttering you up
###531 with a string of compliments, he's about to do
###534 one of two things - confess or request.
###536 Which is it?
###538 Er...
###539 Don't lie! If you've got something to say, say it.
###542 I've just...
###544 Speak!
###545 Well, now it's out in the open, who Cilla's dad is,
###549 I was thinking if like... if we could...
###551 well, when she's Christened, if we could give her a second name?
###555 You know, cos her mam gave her her first name,
###557 her dad can give her her second.
###559 What were you thinking of?
###561 Maureen.
###561 Fuck off.
###562 What, it's me mam's name.
###563 She can keep it.
###565 It's not fair, Mimi. You get to do everything
###568 and I just get shit on by you, Shane, Jamie and Micky.
###570 OK.
###571 Always taking the piss out of... out of me.
###574 Did you just say OK then?
###578 On one condition.
###580 That you convert, come over to our side.
###583 You mean support Liverpool?
###586 I mean become a Catholic, you knobhead.
###589 Oh... oh, right. Yeah, yeah.
###604 You've been named, Marty boy. Armed robber at the Post Office.
###609 Cuddly little Marty with his funny little ways.
###612 Wouldn't harm a fly, eh?
###614 F... f... fuck off.
###616 Terrify a gang of pensioners half to death in a Post Office queue, yes,
###619 but wouldn't harm a fly.
###620 Fuck off, Shane.
###621 Come on, I'm fucking with you.
###623 You know what, I've been doing a bit of research, mate.
###626 All you have to do is type in 'Arson' and 'Fuengerola'
###631 and it's fucking amazing what pops up.
###636 You know, it's funny you never mentioned that your wife and kids
###639 died in a house fire.
###642 Anyone'd think you had something to hide, mate.
###645 Save your breath, Marty, you're going to need it.
###648 I just called the filth.
###650 I've told them where you were.
###652 SIREN
###653 Run.
###657 Run!
###675 I've got a few more cast-offs for Marty...
###679 I was dr... dragged out of bed last night
###683 by an armed copper
###686 with his gun shoved half-way up my fucking nostril!
###688 What, family stuff?
###689 They were asking me where Marty was.
###691 I said, "I don't know", and spent the next...
###695 nine hours helping the police with their enquiries.
###700 Someone must've grassed.
###703 That'd be me.
###706 And since when did you develop a conscience?
###709 When I found out Marty's wife and kids died in an arson attack.
###714 Spate of fires across Fuengerola. Culprit never found.
###718 But you got a fucking nutter out there
###721 with a history of that sort of stuff and, well, one and one... is two.
###726 He killed them?
###727 Yep. Seems that way.
###730 I was thinking of a trip into town.
###732 Get you some new gear, something to eat, eh?
###735 That ten grand you got for grassing him up burning a hole in your pocket?
###739 It were anonymous.
###742 I'm booked solid all morning.
###745 Who wants a fuck at this hour?
###746 You... Once upon a time.
###752 The thing is, I don't know anything about God or religion, Father.
###756 He's C of E. Is he allowed to change sides, Father?
###760 We don't really think of it as sides, now, do we, Mimi?
###763 It'll be a lot of hard work on your part, Billy.
###766 You'll have to research the faith, attend classes.
###769 He's not afraid of a bit of hard work.
###772 It's for my daughter.
###773 And for you, too.
###774 Front of the queue at the Pearly Gates
###776 if you're a Catholic, eh, Father?
###779 We'll keep it informal for the time being.
###782 Yeah.
###783 Look forward to getting to know you as well as the rest of the family.
###786 Lovely seeing you, Father.
###789 And you, Mimi.
###789 Take care.
###791 I will.
###792 See ya.
###793 Micky. Father.
###795 Bye now!
###799 What's he doing here? Has someone died?
###801 Billy's going to be a Catholic.
###803 What the fuck for? It's shit!
###805 Thou shall not do this, that and the other. And the guilt.
###808 Takes you about a week to get over spilling your seed.
###811 Stay Proddy, man, much more fun.
###814 I'm doing it for Cilla.
###815 You're doing it to get in with me mam.
###816 It's for my daughter, your sister.
###818 She won't thank you.
###819 If I was going to change, I'd go Muslim.
###822 Food's better and all you've got to do is grow a beard.
###824 You won't even pass the exams, you, anyway.
###826 Why's that, then?
###828 Cos you're a thick cunt.
###836 Mam!
###837 Mam!
###839 You, living room, now!
###841 It wasn't me!
###843 Don't have me saying it twice!
###853 No matter how hard I try,
###855 your lads are just going to keep throwing it back in my face.
###858 Nothing I do'll ever be good enough for them.
###859 It's a lot for them to take on, you being here. Going to take time.
###864 You can handle this. You're a tough lad.
###867 Made of sterner stuff than they know. Aren't you?
###870 Yeah.
###871 Now, these spuds aren't going to peel themselves, are they?
###885 Shane's here.
###887 I told you. Tell him I'm occupied.
###889 I did but he said he'd wait.
###891 Look, if you and him's got a problem, sort it!
###893 Cos punters don't like looking at a face like
###895 a smacked arse. They can get that at home.
###898 Give me a minute. Tell him I'm just tidying, then send him up.
###917 The only time I see anything floral is weddings, funerals
###920 and when you're trying to keep me sweet after a fuck-up.
###923 By way of an apology?
###924 A fuck-up.
###926 Yeah. A monumental fuck-up.
###929 You know, I've been that busy, my mind's been preoccupied
###934 with a million and one different things,
###936 and I... I've neglected the one thing that I value most.
###941 I said thing, I don't...
###943 I mean you.
###945 And I'm sorry.
###951 I know you've been distracted as well.
###954 Hang on a minute... I don't blame you.
###957 I forced you away.
###965 It takes two to tango... badly.
###971 We are good, us, y'know.
###973 We used to be.
###974 We still are.
###979 Let's make a bit of time.
###982 Get away from here.
###985 I want to be your husband again.
###988 I love you, Kelly Maguire.
###990 Yeah?
###992 Yeah.
###994 Yeah?
###996 Yes.
###1001 Yeah?
###1002 Yes!
###1014 Yeah! Let's go!
###1018 He's lovely, isn't he?
###1020 Wouldn't think that if you had to spend as long as me looking at him.
###1023 I meant Father Craig. So did I.
###1026 Ever since Billy started his conversion classes,
###1029 we can't get rid of him.

###1090 Never heard it called that before but... we talked.
###1097 Toilets.
###1099 Now!
###1105 Look, I'm tired, that's all this is.
###1107 I'm relieved your marriage is back on track.
###1109 I appreciate the concern...
###1111 but we've never been close and I'm not the sister type.
###1113 I just wish I'd had someone to talk to when
###1115 me and Jamie were fucking ourselves over.
###1117 We've had a rough few months. Like I said, we've talked and we're OK.
###1120 Good, I'm glad. Cos it'd be all too easy to get hung up on someone
###1124 who might let you down, wouldn't it?
###1126 You know, someone who might offer a bit of excitement short-term...
###1130 But long-term?
###1132 You wouldn't back him if he was a horse at the National, would you?
###1136 No, I don't think I would.
###1138 TOILET DOOR OPENS
###1138 Use the men's!
###1143 Sometimes we can get distracted. Things can seem a bit mundane.
###1147 We think the grass is always greener but before long we've...
###1151 I lost everything.
###1154 This isn't a bollocking, Kel.
###1156 I just don't want you to make the same mistake I did.

###1163 Well, drip dry.
###1164 Without going into detail, that approach won't have much effect.
###1168 Fine.
###1174 You can talk to me, you know, when it comes to stuff like this.
###1179 You can trust me.
###1180 (WOMEN ENTER CHATTERING)
###1191 Jamie, usual, double and whatever those boring bastards are having.
###1196 With a cyanide-fucking-chaser for each of them.
###1199 You not enjoying it?
###1201 He's everywhere I turn. Never shuts the fuck up!
###1204 God this, God that, God the other.
###1207 He's got a bleeding parable for everything.
###1209 Can't even wipe your arse without him turning it
###1212 into some kind of a lesson.
###1215 Hello, Father Craig!
###1220 Hiya, Father. Going already?
###1223 Service in the morning, Mimi. Billy says you'll be there.
###1226 Not going to miss out, am I?
###1234 Stop this now.
###1235 Gone!
###1236 I-I just wanted to impress you.
###1238 Get rid of that boring bastard, then I'll be impressed.
###1255 She obviously wants something extreme.
###1259 Y'know, a declaration of your intentions.
###1261 Reckon?
###1263 Think big, Billy. It's obviously the way to her heart. If not her heart,
###1266 might get you into her knickers.
###1269 What d'you think she'd really, really like?
###1272 What d'you reckon'd make her happy? Her and the boys?
###1280 What's going on?
###1282 Well, I just want you to be happy, that's all.
###1284 So...
###1286 I did something that'd make you happy.
###1299 So you robbed my car?
###1302 Borrowed.
###1303 Then what the fuck did you give him?
###1304 Just a load of ale. Bottle of whisky.
###1307 And? Some pills I found in Micky's sock drawer.
###1311 The blue ones?
###1311 Orange?
###1312 Not the yellow ones.
###1314 One of them'd floor all the Happy Mondays! How many d'you slip him?
###1317 Four.
###1319 Oh! Well no wonder he's dead!
###1321 They're meant for horses of a nervous disposition!
###1324 What in the name of God did you think you were doing?
###1327 You said you'd be impressed if I got rid of him!
###1329 I didn't mean kill him, you thick twat!
###1332 I meant out of my line of vision for a split second!
###1335 Out of my range of hearing, not bleeding dead!
###1338 So what we going to do?
###1341 Pray for forgiveness. He's killed a Priest.
###1344 Well, let him fucking pray then. It's nowt to do with us.
###1348 I'm going to hell. And I'm not even Catholic!
###1351 Oh, and you think God's going to turn a blind eye to the fact
###1354 that we're sitting round discussing how to get shot of the body!?
###1359 Er, excuse me, I just came up with a
###1361 solution that went down like a lead balloon.
###1363 The solution being that we take him to your mate's sausage factory?!
###1367 You've never objected before.
###1368 I've never turned a priest into a sausage before!
###1374 We'll be excommunicated.
###1376 We're already excommunicated.
###1379 Call your mate. Make the arrangements.
###1382 Hang on...
###1384 You're not actually going to go through with this?
###1387 Have you got a better solution?
###1389 Remarkable. Just when I thought you'd never be able to shock me...
###1395 OK, if we're going ahead with this, you need to make yourself scarce.
###1400 No way! He got us into this shit, he's going to help get us out!
###1404 They'll get a fair few sausages out of him,
###1406 though, won't they? He was a big lad, wasn't he?
###1408 Fucking arse!
###1432 Kelly!
###1433 What d'you want?
###1438 Played me for a fool, didn't you?
###1440 No.
###1442 Not that I blame you. I am a fucking idiot... falling for you... your lies.
###1446 If you think I lied, why did you come?
###1449 To tell you to get out my life, to keep on running.
###1454 Fuck off so far away from me and never come back!
###1456 Sue left me.
###1459 She walked out and took the kids.
###1461 She wanted stuff I couldn't give her and...
###1464 She found someone who could.
###1466 And I begged her...
###1468 I begged her to come back, but she said, "To what?"
###1473 To what.
###1476 I was on my own.
###1478 And I was getting pissed most nights cos...
###1481 And I lost my job cos I couldn't get out of bed for the hangovers.
###1487 I ended up on the street.
###1490 And I was angry with myself, I was so angry.
###1493 I'd lost my wife, my kids... My job, my flat.
###1498 So you set fire to them?
###1506 Took a while, but here he is at last, eh?
###1511 Will the real Marty Fisher please stand up.
###1513 Look... The lying, murdering Marty Fisher.
###1516 No, no, I-I-I...
###1517 Save it.
###1519 I thought you were different.
###1525 Fucking cliche alert!
###1527 I hope they find you, Marty.
###1530 I hope the filth drag you in and I hope you go down for life.
###1536 Sue didn't deserve that.
###1539 And your kids...
###1543 K-K-Kelly...
###1544 Fuck off.
###1546 I love you!
###1550 And I love Shane.
###1573 Shit!
###1574 They're still looking for Marty.
###1576 Right, Father Craig's pissed after an all-night wake.
###1579 We're taking him back to church. Everyone stay calm.
###1582 Can I ask where you're going, lads?
###1583 Just bringing a mate home. Bit worse for wear.
###1586 Hope you sober up for Sunday, Father! Me daughter's christening.
###1589 He's going to puke!
###1591 Do you want to get out, Father?
###1592 No! He's just rat-arsed.
###1594 Don't tell the Pope(!)
###1595 (LAUGHS) D'you want to open the boot for us, please?
###1597 (WHIMPERS)
###1599 Shh!
###1600 I can't...
###1602 Shut the fuck up!
###1606 Yeah, that's great, mate.
###1606 Cheers.
###1608 Your other mate looks bad, too.
###1610 He can't handle his booze. Think it was the punch what finished him off!
###1613 That'll teach him. Cheers, lads.
###1619 See you, Father!
###1625 Vodka.
###1626 Double.
###1627 And one for yourself, Mimi.
###1628 Fuck knows you could do with one. What you having?
###1631 Bit early for me.
###1636 To the useless, lying, two-faced, manipulative,
###1640 deceitful gang of total bastardry that is men!
###1643 Fuck knows I'll drink to that.
###1646 Unless it's our Shane you're talking about?
###1649 A punter. Finally revealed his true colours.
###1655 Same again please, Mimi.
###1657 You're working in ten minutes. The barbershop quartet's in.
###1660 You fuck 'em. Turn the light off, they'd never know the difference.
###1663 Course they would!
###1664 This is the male of the species we're talking about, brains in cocks.
###1667 And there's not much room in there for a brain.
###1670 Fuck 'em yourself, or better still, tell 'em to go fuck themselves.
###1673 You've had two verbal warnings, Kelly.
###1676 Third written.
###1677 What - you're going to dismiss me?
###1680 Then I take you to a tribunal and... Oh, no, that's right I can't!
###1684 On account of your business being illegal
###1686 and you'd end up in nick for being a madam!
###1689 Madame!
###1694 All you need do sometimes,
###1696 is take a step back to get a good perspective, isn't it?
###1699 Where's all this coming from?
###1701 From me being let down once too often. That's where from.
###1703 Shane?
###1705 No, we're good.
###1707 Yeah?
###1709 Yeah.
###1730 Y'all right, kidda?
###1732 All right, mate?
###1733 Not bad, mate?
###1733 Yeah, good-good.
###1736 Nice one.
###1740 All right, boys.
###1742 All right, mate.
###1744 Right, we need to get him in here, yeah?
###1746 And then get him to the processing room.
###1748 There'll be a tea break in ten minutes. It'll be empty.
###1750 I'll need a hand stripping him.
###1751 I'll do it.
###1753 You want to bring him over here, Mickey?
###1764 Oof!
###1772 Shit!
###1782 Mam... you need to be here, and quick.
###1804 Eh!
###1805 You said you'd checked he was dead!
###1809 I did!
###1810 Well, you obviously didn't check properly!
###1824 (SIGHS)
###1831 It's a miracle. I'm telling you, it's a miracle!
###1834 Go! Leave the talking to me.
###1843 And I prayed and prayed to God
###1846 to find a solution and he did.
###1852 You OK, Father?
###1855 I, er...
###1857 I don't know.
###1859 I'm sorry, Mimi, I'm not feeling 100%.
###1862 Must've nodded off.
###1868 Had the weirdest dream.
###1873 And the Lord said to me...
###1880 Next time you want to impress me, try a bunch of roses,
###1883 a box of chocolates.
###1884 We were lucky this time, Billy.
###1887 Make sure there isn't a next time.
###1888 You said he was a problem. Thought you wanted rid.
###1890 Why'd she go to you if she did?
###1892 Cos... cos I'm the father of her child.
###1894 That was a biological accident.
###1895 A happy one!
###1897 Yeah, but an accident none the less, Mum.
###1899 Get this straight, Billy.
###1901 If there's a problem in this family that needs solving,
###1904 this family will solve it, you got that?
###1906 We don't need you. Don't want you.
###1909 By the way, you've pissed yourself.
###1913 Oh!
###1919 RADIO PLAYS
###1921 Oh, that hit the spot.
###1923 It was lovely, that.
###1925 Thought you'd like it.
###1926 Liked it? I loved it.
###1928 You don't have to overdo it, Shane.
###1931 No, it was nice that!
###1932 It was chips, bacon and egg.
###1934 It was great!
###1936 I'll do washing up.
###1938 No.
###1939 Come on, I said... I know, and I said I'll do it!
###1943 Sorry.
###1944 No, it's me.
###1945 No, I'm probably trying a bit...
###1947 Don't. It's not you.
###1948 This.
###1950 It's not you. It's me, Shane.
###1951 Just, em...
###1955 (SIGHS)
###1956 it's just me.
###1960 That mean I can go watch the footy that I recorded?
###1968 I love you, Kelly Maguire.
###1975 Yeah, you said.
###1983 Thank you, Carmel.
###2002 Just thought we'd give you this, Father.
###2004 Our contribution to the new roof for the vestry.
###2007 Oh, that's very kind. Thank you.
###2010 So, ten minutes, yeah?

###2024 Course I didn't forget, how could I forget a thing like that.
###2029 And Billy is proper excited, yeah.
###2032 About getting christened, the same time as his daughter!
###2035 Very kind of you to fast-track him.
###2037 He's welling up.
###2039 You know, he's so proud.
###2043 I'm going myself.
###2043 I'll just prepare.
###2049 (WHISPERS) I'm sorry.

###2070 Lovely.
###2073 When?
###2073 Now.
###2074 Nice one.
###2075 If I snuff it, soft arse'd get custody of Cilla.
###2078 That's not going to happen.
###2081 Look at him.
###2083 He's a lovely lad,
###2084 but a few bricks short of a full hod, know what I mean?
###2087 Mimi, I don't actually believe in...
###2089 We've heard it all before, Kelly. You don't believe in God, we know.
###2093 Half the congregation'll be in the same boat.
###2096 I just want you to nod when you're supposed to,
###2099 light a candle, renounce the devil,
###2102 then get back to the pub and get pissed with the rest of us.
###2104 Got that?
###2106 Come on, soft lad.
###2109 Did that just happen?
###2111 Who does she think she is?
###2112 Oh, geez. Come on, Kel, she's always like that.
###2114 Well, she can fuck off!
###2116 You know what? You're always like that.
###2118 And you're always like that. Sitting on the fucking fence.
###2121 What's it going to take for you to back me up, mummy's boy?

###2165 Barbara Castle? In her day.
###2167 Edwina Currie? Posh Scouser.
###2170 A contradiction in terms.
###2172 See, I'd have slotted Thatcher one in her heyday.
###2175 From behind, obviously. Show her who's boss.
###2178 "Ooh, not for turning?"
###2179 Well, you fucking will be after this, Maggie.
###2182 One up the mineshaft in memory of Scargill.
###2185 But Widdecombe?
###2187 Wouldn't really be an angle that would satisfy, would there?
###2191 It's not as if you could half close your eyes, so they're all fuzzy
###2194 and convince yourself it's somebody else.
###2197 Fucking Churchill would be a more attractive proposition.
###2200 Miliband's got a pretty face.
###2203 I think your mistake was going for someone with such a low profile.
###2207 What do you mean?
###2208 A priest? If you want to impress the Maguires, aim high.
###2212 Take out some gangster and you'd be quids in. Telling you.
###2216 You want to reach puberty, keep your trap shut.
###2219 Bin. Now.
###2225 If I'd wanted a gangster, I wouldn't have gotten rid of Paddy.
###2228 I like you because you're you, OK?

###2253 You're one of us, now.
###2257 She means Catholic, by the way. Not one of them.
###2262 Oh, for fuck's sake!
###2276 What the fuck's done that?
###2278 Rats.
###2279 Big fucking rat!
###2305 Excuse I for queue jumping. I've got a turtle's head.
###2308 They're all occupied and I'm next.
###2309 I'm touching cloth!
###2310 Gents!
###2315 I'm...
###2316 Sorry?
###2318 Going to do the decent thing? Hand yourself in?
###2321 Admit you're a fucking scumbag for killing your wife and kids?
###2325 A pathological liar
###2327 for making me believe we had some kind of future?
###2330 Wasn't supposed to happen this way.
###2331 Too right!
###2333 I wasn't supposed to fall for the nutter
###2336 with fuck all to offer but a criminal record and an empty wallet.
###2339 I wanted the white charger and the shining armour and I get you!
###2344 Fucking you!
###2349 Lights will be back on any minute.
###2350 Great.
###2358 Making sure no-one's fallen over, broken their neck.
###2361 Home soon, eh?
###2369 You never asked. That's what fucking hurt. After what we'd said.
###2373 What you said you felt. You never asked.
###2375 Never!
###2376 What did I never ask, eh?
###2378 You fucking lunatic!
###2379 I wanted to tell you, but I wanted you to know me first.
###2382 You wanted me to fall for you first!
###2386 I didn't do it. If you need me to, I can prove it.
###2390 I didn't do it, Kel.
###2393 I couldn't...
###2397 But even you thought I could.
###2400 Even you.
###2408 I'll be at the bus stop.
###2411 Corner of Muirfield Avenue
###2414 and Lytton Street - nine o'clock.
###2419 I want to start again.
###2420 New life...
###2424 with someone I love.
###2426 Someone I never thought I'd have the luck to come across.
###2431 It's a lot to think about, I know,
###2433 and I would've done it sooner if all this hadn't have happened, but...
###2439 I love you
###2441 and I want you with me.
