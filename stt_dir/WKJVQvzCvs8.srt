[SHOUTING]


3
0:0:8,54 --> 0:0:25,128



4
0:0:25,128 --> 0:0:26,378
MALE SPEAKER: Whoa.


5
0:0:26,378 --> 0:0:32,689



6
0:0:32,689 --> 0:0:34,366
SEAN MALTO: The first time I
ever heard of Eric Koston?


7
0:0:34,366 --> 0:0:36,9



8
0:0:36,9 --> 0:0:38,18
You know what?


9
0:0:38,18 --> 0:0:42,75
It was probably "Yeah Right."
Like, that was


10
0:0:42,75 --> 0:0:43,84
way later, I know.


11
0:0:43,84 --> 0:0:47,55
Like, there's so much of Eric
before that I never really


12
0:0:47,55 --> 0:0:50,94
realize, but like, "Yeah Right"
and that whole video


13
0:0:50,94 --> 0:0:53,93
coming out was probably
the first time I'd


14
0:0:53,93 --> 0:0:56,2
ever heard of him.


15
0:0:56,2 --> 0:1:0,22
And I saw the trailer, and it
was him yelling at some kid.


16
0:1:0,22 --> 0:1:4,4
And I knew he was the best, you
know, Eric Koston having


17
0:1:4,4 --> 0:1:9,93
last par, and just being that
dude at the time was crazy.


18
0:1:9,93 --> 0:1:11,92
He did an ollie backside
noseblunt at Arco.


19
0:1:11,92 --> 0:1:15,84
I learned an ollie backside
noseblunt like two weeks ago.


20
0:1:15,84 --> 0:1:21,47
And for him to do it at
Arco, like, 2003.


21
0:1:21,47 --> 0:1:23,51
That is crazy.


22
0:1:23,51 --> 0:1:25,64
ATIBA JEFFERSON: It's always fun
to watch Eric get a video


23
0:1:25,64 --> 0:1:29,24
deadline, because that's when he
starts like, fuck this, I'm


24
0:1:29,24 --> 0:1:31,13
doing this, we're
getting tricks.


25
0:1:31,13 --> 0:1:34,9
You know, tray flip noseblunt
slide in "Yeah Right."


26
0:1:34,9 --> 0:1:36,79
It's an hour and a half away,
Santa Barbara, and we just


27
0:1:36,79 --> 0:1:38,97
drove up right to
get that trick.


28
0:1:38,97 --> 0:1:40,1
And that's what he did.


29
0:1:40,1 --> 0:1:43,99
Drove up there at night, lit it
up, got it, and came home.


30
0:1:43,99 --> 0:1:49,3
And to me that, that's like
a Michael Jordan moment.


31
0:1:49,3 --> 0:1:54,87
Like, he literally took over
the game and won it.


32
0:1:54,87 --> 0:1:56,88
TY EVANS: He was just
killing stuff.


33
0:1:56,88 --> 0:2:0,965
I remember going to like that
big hub ledge in Philly, and


34
0:2:0,965 --> 0:2:2,125
he just destroyed that thing.


35
0:2:2,125 --> 0:2:4,48
180 nose grind, black
lip, like did all


36
0:2:4,48 --> 0:2:5,645
that stuff over then.


37
0:2:5,645 --> 0:2:8,449
And then, like when he went out
to Japan and skated that


38
0:2:8,449 --> 0:2:10,774
white hub, and just murdered
that thing, and did a ton of


39
0:2:10,774 --> 0:2:11,65
shit on that.


40
0:2:11,65 --> 0:2:14,42
ATIBA JEFFERSON: He did so many
tricks on this hub in


41
0:2:14,42 --> 0:2:15,53
that one night.


42
0:2:15,53 --> 0:2:18,395
And this whole trip, it was
him, McCrank, and Rodrigo.


43
0:2:18,395 --> 0:2:21,825
And Rodrigo got sick, and
literally him and McCrank were


44
0:2:21,825 --> 0:2:24,33
like, just two fucking
wild dogs doing


45
0:2:24,33 --> 0:2:26,7
demos and skating street.


46
0:2:26,7 --> 0:2:28,97
They were very tight
at that point.


47
0:2:28,97 --> 0:2:30,93
GUY MARIANO: Eric and
Rick McCrank.


48
0:2:30,93 --> 0:2:32,27
That was a good combo.


49
0:2:32,27 --> 0:2:34,22
Because Rick is like,
just like Eric.


50
0:2:34,22 --> 0:2:35,13
He's super good.


51
0:2:35,13 --> 0:2:37,14
Tranny, rail, gap, whatever.


52
0:2:37,14 --> 0:2:40,2
And I think McCrank, being like
a bigger rail skater at


53
0:2:40,2 --> 0:2:43,49
that time, he really pushed
Eric to start doing some


54
0:2:43,49 --> 0:2:45,1
bigger rails and bigger gaps.


55
0:2:45,1 --> 0:2:47,79
And like, in that "Yeah Right"
thing, you see them feeding


56
0:2:47,79 --> 0:2:49,35
off each other.


57
0:2:49,35 --> 0:2:52,73
I like the Rick McCrank and Eric
Koston better than the


58
0:2:52,73 --> 0:2:55,68
Guy Mariano Eric Koston.


59
0:2:55,68 --> 0:2:56,145
My opinion.


60
0:2:56,145 --> 0:2:57,49
MALE SPEAKER: You were
dragging him down.


61
0:2:57,49 --> 0:2:58,785
GUY MARIANO: I was dragging
Eric down, and


62
0:2:58,785 --> 0:2:59,535
Rick brought him up.


63
0:2:59,535 --> 0:3:1,97
MALE SPEAKER: You were like,
let's [INAUDIBLE].


64
0:3:1,97 --> 0:3:4,18
GUY MARIANO: I'm trying to get
Eric to bum walls, McCrank's


65
0:3:4,18 --> 0:3:5,43
getting him to the
double kinks.


66
0:3:5,43 --> 0:3:8,95



67
0:3:8,95 --> 0:3:12,7
TY EVANS: The early, early
2000 era of Eric, he was


68
0:3:12,7 --> 0:3:12,97
unstoppable.


69
0:3:12,97 --> 0:3:15,28
Dudes are in their prime in
their certain time where all


70
0:3:15,28 --> 0:3:17,87
that stuff works, and like, that
was like his chunk right


71
0:3:17,87 --> 0:3:21,47
there where he was
just killing it.


72
0:3:21,47 --> 0:3:24,4
Back then, all that stuff came,
like, so quick that like


73
0:3:24,4 --> 0:3:26,44
now, it's like, forget it.


74
0:3:26,44 --> 0:3:28,87
Guys are like, checking
the wind.


75
0:3:28,87 --> 0:3:34,63
Fucking, every distraction in
the world's like, crazy now.


76
0:3:34,63 --> 0:3:37,29



77
0:3:37,29 --> 0:3:39,67
ERIC KOSTON: 2001 Reader's
Choice Award.


78
0:3:39,67 --> 0:3:42,11
Best all around skater.


79
0:3:42,11 --> 0:3:44,65
You know, now it's pretty high
pressure, where when we


80
0:3:44,65 --> 0:3:46,9
started, it was pretty fun.


81
0:3:46,9 --> 0:3:52,928
Now it's like a virus,
or some antibiotic.


82
0:3:52,928 --> 0:3:54,33
You know?


83
0:3:54,33 --> 0:3:58,51
It only works for so long, and
then the virus gets stronger.


84
0:3:58,51 --> 0:4:0,44
That's how I look at it.


85
0:4:0,44 --> 0:4:2,77
Like guys, OK, that
trick was gnarly.


86
0:4:2,77 --> 0:4:3,88
Now it's not gnarly.


87
0:4:3,88 --> 0:4:6,85
Now it's just like, another
trick in the bag.


88
0:4:6,85 --> 0:4:10,62
MIKE CARROLL: That's one thing
I've felt sorry for him about,


89
0:4:10,62 --> 0:4:13,85
is just like, seeing how much
pressure I would assume he


90
0:4:13,85 --> 0:4:14,62
puts on himself.


91
0:4:14,62 --> 0:4:17,79
ERIC KOSTON: Aw, you
son of a bitch.


92
0:4:17,79 --> 0:4:19,149
MIKE CARROLL: And he feels that
everyone's expecting,


93
0:4:19,149 --> 0:4:23,6
like, I wouldn't even
want to have that.


94
0:4:23,6 --> 0:4:25,715
MALE SPEAKER: For filming "Fully
Flared," did he have a


95
0:4:25,715 --> 0:4:27,385
lot of the pressure that
some of the other


96
0:4:27,385 --> 0:4:29,6
dudes talk about, or?


97
0:4:29,6 --> 0:4:29,25
KELLY BIRD: Yeah.


98
0:4:29,25 --> 0:4:33,34
I feel like he did, because he
was the guy that like, came in


99
0:4:33,34 --> 0:4:36,33
and really was like, the final
piece of the puzzle.


100
0:4:36,33 --> 0:4:37,59
Where everybody was
like, oh my God.


101
0:4:37,59 --> 0:4:38,11
Look, OK.


102
0:4:38,11 --> 0:4:39,31
This is going to
be ridiculous.


103
0:4:39,31 --> 0:4:41,71
Like, the guy thing was
already in motion.


104
0:4:41,71 --> 0:4:43,6
Everything else had been going
for so long, and then it's


105
0:4:43,6 --> 0:4:47,4
like, oh, here comes this dude
to like ice the whole thing.


106
0:4:47,4 --> 0:4:49,9
So I'm sure he felt the pressure
to be like, well,


107
0:4:49,9 --> 0:4:54,1
everybody's going to expect me
to have like the last part,


108
0:4:54,1 --> 0:4:55,6
caliber part.


109
0:4:55,6 --> 0:4:58,32
And then having a year and a
half, maybe fucking a little


110
0:4:58,32 --> 0:5:0,22
bit longer than that
at best to do it.


111
0:5:0,22 --> 0:5:3,215
I'm sure it wasn't the most
pleasurable thing for him.


112
0:5:3,215 --> 0:5:6,68
MALE SPEAKER: A lot of people
thought that you kind of came


113
0:5:6,68 --> 0:5:8,675
in just to film the part,
and that the plan


114
0:5:8,675 --> 0:5:11,6
was to leave anyway.


115
0:5:11,6 --> 0:5:11,79
That's what I heard.


116
0:5:11,79 --> 0:5:14,68
ERIC KOSTON: That pretty absurd
to think that I would


117
0:5:14,68 --> 0:5:17,71
come in just to film a
part and then leave.


118
0:5:17,71 --> 0:5:20,37
Timewise, you just don't have
that kind of luxury in life to


119
0:5:20,37 --> 0:5:21,93
be just bouncing around.


120
0:5:21,93 --> 0:5:24,86
The thing is, when Lakai
started, I'd been a long time


121
0:5:24,86 --> 0:5:29,4
at S. My contract was up, and I
wanted to feel like, sort of


122
0:5:29,4 --> 0:5:34,79
secure at where I was going to
end up at that point on.


123
0:5:34,79 --> 0:5:37,98
I wanted to have, like, some
sort of stake in a company.


124
0:5:37,98 --> 0:5:43,41
At a brand that I, you know,
back and believe in.


125
0:5:43,41 --> 0:5:45,89
And that's what I thought.


126
0:5:45,89 --> 0:5:50,25
And we had come out with like,
a pretty fucking insane video


127
0:5:50,25 --> 0:5:54,88
with "Fully Flared." Probably
one of the best marketing


128
0:5:54,88 --> 0:5:57,39
tools a brand could
come up with.


129
0:5:57,39 --> 0:5:58,67
You know what I mean?


130
0:5:58,67 --> 0:6:0,51
I guess it didn't translate.


131
0:6:0,51 --> 0:6:3,45
KELLY BIRD: His business manager
unearthed some stuff


132
0:6:3,45 --> 0:6:6,11
that was going on, that I
think people either just


133
0:6:6,11 --> 0:6:10,36
didn't take the time to realize,
or were just too busy


134
0:6:10,36 --> 0:6:11,77
that they didn't, you
know what I mean?


135
0:6:11,77 --> 0:6:13,69
They didn't have the time to
deal with it previous to that.


136
0:6:13,69 --> 0:6:18,18
But that really was a point
where everybody was like OK,


137
0:6:18,18 --> 0:6:21,66
some shit's going on here that's
probably not that great


138
0:6:21,66 --> 0:6:23,78
for the brand.


139
0:6:23,78 --> 0:6:24,99
TIM GAVIN: That sucked.


140
0:6:24,99 --> 0:6:26,9
He just came on at
a shitty time.


141
0:6:26,9 --> 0:6:30,48
And he quit.


142
0:6:30,48 --> 0:6:33,34
It really affected me and
him in our relationship.


143
0:6:33,34 --> 0:6:37,23
And you always hear business
and friends, and it sucked.


144
0:6:37,23 --> 0:6:37,715
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


145
0:6:37,715 --> 0:6:39,64
TIM GAVIN: You know, if I were
to do it all over again, man,


146
0:6:39,64 --> 0:6:42,245
I would never, I would've
fucking never have done it.


147
0:6:42,245 --> 0:6:44,76
You know, Rick and the Girl
guys, those guys, like, were


148
0:6:44,76 --> 0:6:46,14
so close, and they're family.


149
0:6:46,14 --> 0:6:48,14
I mean, literally, like
were just so close.


150
0:6:48,14 --> 0:6:50,5
So I always wanted to do
something with them.


151
0:6:50,5 --> 0:6:53,87
And for it to not work out is
really hard to deal with.


152
0:6:53,87 --> 0:6:56,51
ERIC KOSTON: I didn't know
what else to do.


153
0:6:56,51 --> 0:7:1,81
I'd sort of had to take just the
choice of making kind of a


154
0:7:1,81 --> 0:7:3,43
life decision.


155
0:7:3,43 --> 0:7:5,382
Of like, having to--


156
0:7:5,382 --> 0:7:9,165
I've got to go and do
what's best for me.


157
0:7:9,165 --> 0:7:11,72
MALE SPEAKER: Did you know you
were going to go to Nike?


158
0:7:11,72 --> 0:7:13,34
ERIC KOSTON: No, when
I left Lakai, no.


159
0:7:13,34 --> 0:7:16,42
I left knowing I'm just
going to go out and


160
0:7:16,42 --> 0:7:18,8
like, free agent style.


161
0:7:18,8 --> 0:7:20,22
I mean, if you asked me five
years earlier, I'd have been


162
0:7:20,22 --> 0:7:21,6
like, fuck no.


163
0:7:21,6 --> 0:7:22,115
Fuck those dudes.


164
0:7:22,115 --> 0:7:23,57
Fuck that place.


165
0:7:23,57 --> 0:7:24,11
Fuck that.


166
0:7:24,11 --> 0:7:25,15
No, I don't fucking
trust them.


167
0:7:25,15 --> 0:7:27,63
You remember the fucking
first run they did?


168
0:7:27,63 --> 0:7:28,33
It sucked.


169
0:7:28,33 --> 0:7:32,12
But after time, seeing like, how
they run things and what


170
0:7:32,12 --> 0:7:35,53
they do, and how they get
behind their team.


171
0:7:35,53 --> 0:7:39,18
It's crazy how far it's come
along in skateboarding.


172
0:7:39,18 --> 0:7:42,91
It's like, skateboarding's this
huge responsibility to


173
0:7:42,91 --> 0:7:44,26
Nike, you know what I mean?


174
0:7:44,26 --> 0:7:46,78
That we all have.


175
0:7:46,78 --> 0:7:50,67
Now, looking back at
all my shoes that I


176
0:7:50,67 --> 0:7:53,31
designed I copied Nikes.


177
0:7:53,31 --> 0:7:55,35
it's all these Jordans
and Nikes.


178
0:7:55,35 --> 0:7:57,23
MALE SPEAKER: And now you can
make a shoe that, like,


179
0:7:57,23 --> 0:7:58,82
someone else is going to copy.


180
0:7:58,82 --> 0:8:0,2
ERIC KOSTON: Hopefully,
that's like--


181
0:8:0,2 --> 0:8:1,57
MALE SPEAKER: You're like,
the starting point.


182
0:8:1,57 --> 0:8:2,82
ERIC KOSTON: Yeah.


183
0:8:2,82 --> 0:8:5,69



184
0:8:5,69 --> 0:8:6,94
It's a great spot.


185
0:8:6,94 --> 0:8:13,83



186
0:8:13,83 --> 0:8:16,72
SEAN MALTO: When he does
something, he kind of gets


187
0:8:16,72 --> 0:8:18,47
involved in it to the fullest.


188
0:8:18,47 --> 0:8:22,75
Like, Four Star, Girl, Nike,
whatever sponsors he has, he


189
0:8:22,75 --> 0:8:25,8
kind of like, fully
gets into it.


190
0:8:25,8 --> 0:8:28,3
You know, now that he's like,
doing Oakley stuff, has a lot


191
0:8:28,3 --> 0:8:28,94
of responsibilities.


192
0:8:28,94 --> 0:8:33,902
But he's handling it well, and
he's had like, a great career.


193
0:8:33,902 --> 0:8:35,6
And if I've ever learned
anything from


194
0:8:35,6 --> 0:8:36,702
him, it's like, yeah.


195
0:8:36,702 --> 0:8:37,61
You know what I mean?


196
0:8:37,61 --> 0:8:39,27
You gotta work for it.


197
0:8:39,27 --> 0:8:41,23
This shit doesn't just
like, come to you.


198
0:8:41,23 --> 0:8:46,21
You've got to like, work hard
towards something, and just


199
0:8:46,21 --> 0:8:47,56
try to do it right.


200
0:8:47,56 --> 0:8:48,87
And I think that's
what he's done.


201
0:8:48,87 --> 0:8:50,12
He's done a great job at it.


202
0:8:50,12 --> 0:8:55,975



203
0:8:55,975 --> 0:8:57,68
GUY MARIANO: There's a lot of
people that think that he was


204
0:8:57,68 --> 0:8:59,86
just a great skateboarder,
and everything just


205
0:8:59,86 --> 0:9:0,77
fell into his lap.


206
0:9:0,77 --> 0:9:1,78
But that's not true.


207
0:9:1,78 --> 0:9:3,82
Like, Eric worked really hard.


208
0:9:3,82 --> 0:9:5,54
He battled for his stuff,
you know what I mean?


209
0:9:5,54 --> 0:9:8,55
Like, he put together like,
over 15 video parts like


210
0:9:8,55 --> 0:9:10,24
"Bangers," you know
what I mean?


211
0:9:10,24 --> 0:9:14,8
Like, I don't need another
Koston "Banger" video part to


212
0:9:14,8 --> 0:9:15,63
know that he's amazing.


213
0:9:15,63 --> 0:9:16,77
You know what I mean?


214
0:9:16,77 --> 0:9:17,99
I have tons of that.


215
0:9:17,99 --> 0:9:20,59
It makes me happy to see him
with his family, like, doing


216
0:9:20,59 --> 0:9:23,49
good, and being almost
like the Michael


217
0:9:23,49 --> 0:9:24,96
Jordan of our industry.


218
0:9:24,96 --> 0:9:28,95
And I can say that, and a lot
of people will back that.


219
0:9:28,95 --> 0:9:30,13
ERIC KOSTON: This is Finn.


220
0:9:30,13 --> 0:9:30,98
FEMALE SPEAKER: Finny.


221
0:9:30,98 --> 0:9:32,66
ERIC KOSTON: Yeah?


222
0:9:32,66 --> 0:9:33,98
You want me to help you
on your skateboard?


223
0:9:33,98 --> 0:9:34,75
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


224
0:9:34,75 --> 0:9:35,71
ERIC KOSTON: OK.


225
0:9:35,71 --> 0:9:36,89
I have to like, tighter
her wheels up.


226
0:9:36,89 --> 0:9:38,22
I tighten the wheels up, too.


227
0:9:38,22 --> 0:9:41,16
But still, it's like, I've gotta
crank them even more.


228
0:9:41,16 --> 0:9:43,47
MALE SPEAKER: You know, us at
Girl, and just skateboarding


229
0:9:43,47 --> 0:9:46,5
in general, we've always looked
to Eric to show us the


230
0:9:46,5 --> 0:9:49,7
way, and that's why
he is Eric Koston.


231
0:9:49,7 --> 0:9:52,325
ERIC KOSTON: Take your paci
out when you skate.


232
0:9:52,325 --> 0:9:53,32
It's safer.


233
0:9:53,32 --> 0:9:54,68
FEMALE SPEAKER: It goes
back and forth.


234
0:9:54,68 --> 0:9:55,58
ERIC KOSTON: It does.


235
0:9:55,58 --> 0:9:57,75
It goes back and forth.


236
0:9:57,75 --> 0:10:0,43
MALE SPEAKER: Have you ever
seen your dad skate?


237
0:10:0,43 --> 0:10:1,82
ERIC KOSTON: She saw
me at a contest.


238
0:10:1,82 --> 0:10:5,7
I think it was like a Maloof,
or something.


239
0:10:5,7 --> 0:10:7,21
But she was there.


240
0:10:7,21 --> 0:10:9,83
And she was following me the
whole way, I guess, and like,


241
0:10:9,83 --> 0:10:12,77
laughing and like,
tripping out.


242
0:10:12,77 --> 0:10:15,18
I don't think she could
even talk then.


243
0:10:15,18 --> 0:10:16,43
That's so sick.


244
0:10:16,43 --> 0:10:18,42



245
0:10:18,42 --> 0:10:20,23
Sketchy.


246
0:10:20,23 --> 0:10:20,88
Stay on your knees.


247
0:10:20,88 --> 0:10:21,94
Whoa.


248
0:10:21,94 --> 0:10:23,19
Stay on your knees, June.


249
0:10:23,19 --> 0:12:23,19
