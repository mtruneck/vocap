###1 "Google began as a research project in 1996."
###4 "This is a look at how search has evolved."
###8 Gomes: Our goal is actually to make improvements to Search
###12 that just answer the user's information need.
###15 Get them to their answer faster and faster.
###18 So that there's almost a seamless connection between
###21 their thoughts and their information needs
###23 and the search results that they find.
###30 Singhal: Well, Google was started based upon algorithms
###34 that Larry and Sergey developed in Stanford
###37 called the PageRank algorithm.
###39 And they used that algorithm to indeed build
###42 a very novel way of searching the web.
###44 Gomes: What was happening at that point was
###46 there was this huge explosion of content in the web,
###48 a bigger explosion of information
###50 than had ever happened before.
###51 And it was getting increasingly hard to find
###54 the piece of content you wanted.
###56 "Adwords"
###57 Mayer: In the beginning,
###59 we didn't have any advertisements at all.
###60 And as we went to add advertisements,
###62 it was very important to us that those ads be as relevant
###65 to the search as the search results themselves.
###67 It was also very important to us that they be distinguished
###69 from the search results.
###71 Gomes: There was a clear separation between ads
###73 and Search from the very earliest times.
###75 Search had one goal and one goal alone,
###77 to provide the most relevant information for the user
###81 in the fastest time possible.
###83 "Universal Results"
###85 Mayer: In 1999 and 2000, we had a search engine
###87 that worked wonderfully,
###88 and it worked wonderfully for web pages.
###89 One of the things we saw was,
###91 as Google got better and better,
###92 users expected more and more from it.
###94 They didn't want just web pages.
###96 They wanted the best possible information available,
###99 be that a picture or a book.
###101 And so we started looking at how we could search new
###104 and other forms of content.
###105 And Image Search was the first of those
###107 because we know that a picture is worth 1,000 words,
###110 and there were a lot of times when people would say,
###112 you know, what is turquoise?
###113 You know, we got a search, "what is turquoise?"
###115 And there's no way to answer that question
###117 without a picture.
###121 Singhal: When September 11th happened,
###123 we as Google were failing our users.
###126 Our users were searching for "New York Twin Towers,"
###129 and our results had nothing relevant,
###132 nothing related to the sad events of the day
###135 because our index was crawled a month earlier,
###138 and, of course, there was no news in that index.
###142 So we placed links to all the news organizations like CNN
###146 right on our front page saying please visit those sites
###149 to get the news of the day,
###151 because our search is failing you.
###153 My friend Krishna and I were attending a conference
###156 at the time, and Krishna started thinking about the problem,
###161 saying, "If we could crawl news quickly,
###164 "and we can provide multiple points of view
###167 "about the same story to our users,
###170 wouldn't it be amazing?"
###171 That was the birth of Google News
###173 specialized search service.
###177 Mayer: Well, in 2002, one of the trends we started to see
###179 was that the web had become a lot more rich.
###181 More images, more video, different kinds of content.
###184 And we started to realize that our users expected Google
###186 to be able to find something if it existed on the web.
###189 They didn't care if it was text or a web page or news,
###193 they wanted it all in one place.
###195 And so we came up with this notion of Universal Search,
###197 the idea that you could just go to Google,
###199 and no matter what type of content it was,
###201 we could find it.
###203 One of the challenges that came up in Universal Search is that
###205 we were really comparing apples and oranges.
###207 Singhal: You can imagine these apples are web pages,
###209 and you can imagine an orange would be an image.
###213 When we look at ranking images,
###215 we know what the aspect ratio of an image is,
###219 how big is the image, how many pixels this image is.
###222 Is it a black and white image or a color image?
###225 And all these signals are only relevant to images,
###230 but are not relevant to web pages.
###232 And that's why Universal Search was such a hard task
###236 when we did it, because the science was not fully developed.
###239 Mayer: We basically ended up putting things
###241 either on the top of the page, on the bottom of the page,
###243 or somewhere in the middle
###245 because we didn't have a finer-grained way
###248 of looking at the relevance,
###249 especially across different media types.
###251 Singhal: And over the years,
###252 we developed our science tremendously,
###254 and today we are beginning to place
###257 several kinds of information in multiple positions
###259 on our result page
###261 as our algorithms get better and better.
###262 "Quick Answers"
###264 Gomes: Our goal is to make it so that the improvement we make
###267 is so much what you wanted
###269 and fits so cleanly into the flow
###271 of what you are looking for
###273 that you almost don't notice that it's happened.
###276 And looking back at it, it seems obvious that that's the way
###278 it should have always been in the first place.
###280 Menzel: When you do need a specific bit of information,
###283 Google tries to provide you exactly that
###286 using our Quick Answers.
###288 For example, take sport scores.
###290 You kind of want to know what the score is right now.
###293 You want to know how tall is the Empire State Building?
###296 Wright: We want users to come to Google
###298 and get their information as quickly as they possibly can.
###300 And with Instant, you don't even have to type in
###302 your full thought.
###303 You don't have to hit enter.
###305 You can type in something like, "bike h,"
###307 and we'll just show you the results right there
###309 before you've even finished your thoughts.
###311 "The Future of Search"
###312 Menzel: We are pushing the boundaries
###314 of how you actually fundamentally interact
###317 with the search engine itself.
###319 With Search by Image, you can actually use that image
###322 as an input for the search.
###324 Singhal: The truth is that our users need
###327 much more complex answers.
###329 My dream has always been to build the "Star Trek" computer.
###334 And in my ideal world,
###336 I would be able to walk up to a computer and say,
###340 "Hey, what is the best time for me to sow seeds in India,
###346 given that monsoon was early this year?"
###348 And once we can answer that question,
###351 which we don't today,
###353 people will be looking for answers
###354 to even more complex questions.
###357 These are all genuine information needs.
###359 Genuine questions that, if we, Google, can answer,
###363 our users would become more knowledgeable,
###366 and they would be more satisfied in their quest for knowledge.
