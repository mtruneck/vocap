1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,65



2
0:0:0,65 --> 0:0:3,43
STEVE: You know, in the summer
time, there's nothing I like


3
0:0:3,43 --> 0:0:5,2
more than just going camping.


4
0:0:5,2 --> 0:0:8,83
Being in the complete
wilderness, completely alone,


5
0:0:8,83 --> 0:0:11,12
and camping with my trusty
tent right here.


6
0:0:11,12 --> 0:0:12,72
You know what I like to
do when we're camping?


7
0:0:12,72 --> 0:0:14,51
I also like to make s'mores.


8
0:0:14,51 --> 0:0:17,33
The problem with this is that
in Colorado we have a lot of


9
0:0:17,33 --> 0:0:21,6
forest fires, and so because
of those forest--


10
0:0:21,6 --> 0:0:23,49
Because of those forest fires,
I've got to come up with a new


11
0:0:23,49 --> 0:0:25,54
way to be able to roast
marshmallows.


12
0:0:25,54 --> 0:0:28,4
And I think I've got a great
idea using just the


13
0:0:28,4 --> 0:0:31,365
power of the sun.


14
0:0:31,365 --> 0:0:34,42
I'm Steve Spangler and I'm all
about making science fun.


15
0:0:34,42 --> 0:0:37,4
For the last 20 years, I've
been teaching ways to turn


16
0:0:37,4 --> 0:0:40,41
ordinary science experiments
into unforgettable learning


17
0:0:40,41 --> 0:0:41,42
experiences.


18
0:0:41,42 --> 0:0:44,7
I have an amazing team who will
do whatever it takes to


19
0:0:44,7 --> 0:0:46,81
affect the way people
think about science.


20
0:0:46,81 --> 0:0:49,9
And to do that I live
by one motto.


21
0:0:49,9 --> 0:0:52,13
Make it big, do it right,
give it class.


22
0:0:52,13 --> 0:0:57,44



23
0:0:57,44 --> 0:1:0,38
Well, before we can harness
the power of the sun to be


24
0:1:0,38 --> 0:1:2,98
able to cook our s'mores, we
need to learn something about


25
0:1:2,98 --> 0:1:5,54
the science of this solar
radiation that's


26
0:1:5,54 --> 0:1:6,52
coming to the Earth.


27
0:1:6,52 --> 0:1:8,0
See the sun up there?


28
0:1:8,0 --> 0:1:11,97
It's this giant enormous ball of
gas that goes through this


29
0:1:11,97 --> 0:1:15,36
fusion reaction where there's
four hydrogen atoms that get


30
0:1:15,36 --> 0:1:18,2
fused together to make one
helium atom and this--


31
0:1:18,2 --> 0:1:18,88
That's not really important.


32
0:1:18,88 --> 0:1:21,48
What's important is all this
radiation is coming down and


33
0:1:21,48 --> 0:1:24,41
the Earth's atmosphere, just the
air and the ozone layer,


34
0:1:24,41 --> 0:1:28,1
block 97% to 95% of this
radiation that comes through.


35
0:1:28,1 --> 0:1:30,18
But the stuff that does get
through can still be


36
0:1:30,18 --> 0:1:33,4
dangerous, and that's why you
need something like this UV


37
0:1:33,4 --> 0:1:36,8
checker to tell you whether or
not you need to have sunscreen


38
0:1:36,8 --> 0:1:37,7
and how much you need to have.


39
0:1:37,7 --> 0:1:39,48
So you just push the little
button here on this solar


40
0:1:39,48 --> 0:1:42,32
index meter and it reads the
amount of UVA, which are the


41
0:1:42,32 --> 0:1:45,19
longest waves all the way to
UVC, which are the shortest


42
0:1:45,19 --> 0:1:48,55
waves, to be able to determine
how much sunscreen you need.


43
0:1:48,55 --> 0:1:51,16
Bottom line, you've got to
have sun protection.


44
0:1:51,16 --> 0:1:53,13
So let's just say you don't have
one of these fancy little


45
0:1:53,13 --> 0:1:55,95
UV detectors, is there another
way to be able to see the


46
0:1:55,95 --> 0:1:57,81
radiation that's coming
through the sky?


47
0:1:57,81 --> 0:1:59,3
Come to find out, there is.


48
0:1:59,3 --> 0:2:1,65
They're these fancy little
beads called UV


49
0:2:1,65 --> 0:2:4,29
color changing beads.


50
0:2:4,29 --> 0:2:6,67
You see, these beads start
perfectly white when they're


51
0:2:6,67 --> 0:2:7,84
not in ultraviolet light.


52
0:2:7,84 --> 0:2:10,6
But as soon as they're exposed
to ultraviolet light, you can


53
0:2:10,6 --> 0:2:10,949
see what happens here.


54
0:2:10,949 --> 0:2:12,56
Watch.


55
0:2:12,56 --> 0:2:14,85
See the white goes to this
beautiful color.


56
0:2:14,85 --> 0:2:17,85
And there's actually a pigment
in each one of these that the


57
0:2:17,85 --> 0:2:21,9
ultraviolet light causes the
bond inside to be able to


58
0:2:21,9 --> 0:2:22,51
dance and twist and
you get these


59
0:2:22,51 --> 0:2:23,84
beautiful colors like this.


60
0:2:23,84 --> 0:2:26,51
You can see, just like glass,
this plastic here, on the


61
0:2:26,51 --> 0:2:29,27
outside of this pail, allows
the ultraviolet light to be


62
0:2:29,27 --> 0:2:30,57
able to come through enough
to be able to


63
0:2:30,57 --> 0:2:31,72
make them change color.


64
0:2:31,72 --> 0:2:33,76
But if you dig down inside,
where we haven't seen any at


65
0:2:33,76 --> 0:2:34,95
all, take a look at this.


66
0:2:34,95 --> 0:2:37,15
You can see they actually are
white on the top until the


67
0:2:37,15 --> 0:2:39,29
moment they reach the
ultraviolet light.


68
0:2:39,29 --> 0:2:42,66



69
0:2:42,66 --> 0:2:44,47
Now, the really cool thing about
these color changing


70
0:2:44,47 --> 0:2:46,76
beads is that when they're out
of the sun's light, and they


71
0:2:46,76 --> 0:2:50,65
have no UV radiation, the little
pigment bonds twist


72
0:2:50,65 --> 0:2:53,2
back to their original shape
and they go back to their


73
0:2:53,2 --> 0:2:55,7
colorless state, which
is very, very cool.


74
0:2:55,7 --> 0:2:56,95
Watch this.


75
0:2:56,95 --> 0:3:4,9



76
0:3:4,9 --> 0:3:6,56
While these UV color changing
beads are really fun to play


77
0:3:6,56 --> 0:3:8,96
with, they actually are a very,
very cool tool to be


78
0:3:8,96 --> 0:3:11,59
able to use for a science fair
project to be able to test the


79
0:3:11,59 --> 0:3:13,62
effectiveness of sunscreen.


80
0:3:13,62 --> 0:3:15,14
So, here's how it works.


81
0:3:15,14 --> 0:3:18,37
You take a bag and you put the
beads in the bag like this.


82
0:3:18,37 --> 0:3:21,23
Now, they're going to change
color immediately because this


83
0:3:21,23 --> 0:3:24,1
plastic here isn't blocking any
of the sun's radiation.


84
0:3:24,1 --> 0:3:26,84
Now, you take your sunscreen and
you put your sunscreen on


85
0:3:26,84 --> 0:3:31,9
the bag like this and you just
rub it all around the bag.


86
0:3:31,9 --> 0:3:32,59
And you kind of smooth it in.


87
0:3:32,59 --> 0:3:35,6
It's not going to absorb, but
you just try to cover it.


88
0:3:35,6 --> 0:3:37,51
And then you can see
how the intensity


89
0:3:37,51 --> 0:3:39,67
changes with the beads.


90
0:3:39,67 --> 0:3:41,78
So that's why this makes it
such a cool science fair


91
0:3:41,78 --> 0:3:44,42
project is you're really
comparing the effectiveness of


92
0:3:44,42 --> 0:3:47,68
these sunscreens using a control
and some very visual


93
0:3:47,68 --> 0:3:49,4
ways to be able to see how
they change color.


94
0:3:49,4 --> 0:3:50,53
Watch this.


95
0:3:50,53 --> 0:3:53,1
This bag here has no sunscreen
on it whatsoever.


96
0:3:53,1 --> 0:3:54,13
So it's our control bag.


97
0:3:54,13 --> 0:3:56,1
It's just the ultraviolet
light coming through.


98
0:3:56,1 --> 0:3:57,51
You can see, we get
these beautiful


99
0:3:57,51 --> 0:3:59,27
colors as we had before.


100
0:3:59,27 --> 0:4:1,83
The second bag here has
SPF 30 on there.


101
0:4:1,83 --> 0:4:2,98
So now we have some blocking.


102
0:4:2,98 --> 0:4:3,91
But take a look at this.


103
0:4:3,91 --> 0:4:6,26
It's not nearly as intense
as it used to be.


104
0:4:6,26 --> 0:4:8,18
While the blues are still
coming through and some


105
0:4:8,18 --> 0:4:10,82
purples, those yellows are
almost completely white, which


106
0:4:10,82 --> 0:4:13,16
just goes to show you that
there's a different amount of


107
0:4:13,16 --> 0:4:15,75
energy needed to change all the
beads a different color.


108
0:4:15,75 --> 0:4:17,17
Move over to SPF 50.


109
0:4:17,17 --> 0:4:20,89
That's very, very cool because
now we really see some white


110
0:4:20,89 --> 0:4:20,97
beads in here.


111
0:4:20,97 --> 0:4:22,66
Blues are still coming through
but that's cool.


112
0:4:22,66 --> 0:4:25,75
And as soon as you move to 70,
this is the coolest part,


113
0:4:25,75 --> 0:4:29,53
because you really see how faint
and how well the SPF 70


114
0:4:29,53 --> 0:4:33,33
does to be able to block the
harmful rays of the sun.


115
0:4:33,33 --> 0:4:35,57
The very end, you turn them
all back over again.


116
0:4:35,57 --> 0:4:38,61
So now, there's no sunscreen
showing and they should all


117
0:4:38,61 --> 0:4:40,66
look like the control
that you started


118
0:4:40,66 --> 0:4:43,152
with at the very beginning.


119
0:4:43,152 --> 0:4:45,12
That's cool.


120
0:4:45,12 --> 0:4:47,51
Well, now that we know the
science behind the sun and


121
0:4:47,51 --> 0:4:49,3
kind of what we need to do to
cook our s'mores, we've got to


122
0:4:49,3 --> 0:4:51,5
find a device to be
able to do that.


123
0:4:51,5 --> 0:4:53,52
For that, we've got to head
back to the kitchen.


124
0:4:53,52 --> 0:4:55,375
The microwave oven, what
an amazing invention.


125
0:4:55,375 --> 0:4:57,59
Just a couple seconds,
your dinner is ready.


126
0:4:57,59 --> 0:5:0,3
I remember when we got our first
one in the 1970s, every


127
0:5:0,3 --> 0:5:2,8
time Dad cooked a little
burrito, I'd forget my name


128
0:5:2,8 --> 0:5:3,28
and make animal sounds.


129
0:5:3,28 --> 0:5:5,36
But that's not important, what
is important is this.


130
0:5:5,36 --> 0:5:7,27
It uses microwave energy.


131
0:5:7,27 --> 0:5:9,54
Now this is a wavelength of
energy that can either be as


132
0:5:9,54 --> 0:5:12,11
big as a meter, maybe as small
as a millimeter, that have


133
0:5:12,11 --> 0:5:15,22
different energies and different
frequencies between


134
0:5:15,22 --> 0:5:18,32
300 m zzzzs and--


135
0:5:18,32 --> 0:5:20,3
m zzzs?


136
0:5:20,3 --> 0:5:21,68
HIGGINSWORTH: It's megahertz.


137
0:5:21,68 --> 0:5:23,56
STEVE: I told you to do it
phonetically, Higginsworth.


138
0:5:23,56 --> 0:5:25,8
HIGGINSWORTH: Sorry, Steve.


139
0:5:25,8 --> 0:5:26,24
STEVE: Stand by.


140
0:5:26,24 --> 0:5:30,93
Between 300 megahertz
and 300 gigahertz.


141
0:5:30,93 --> 0:5:34,3
Honestly, who cares?


142
0:5:34,3 --> 0:5:36,23
Even though the microwave is
cool, it's not harnessing the


143
0:5:36,23 --> 0:5:39,12
power of the sun, and to do that
it's time to head over to


144
0:5:39,12 --> 0:5:41,75
arts and crafts,
science style.


145
0:5:41,75 --> 0:5:43,84
In order to make our solar
cooker, you're going to need a


146
0:5:43,84 --> 0:5:46,37
recycled pizza box, preferably
your own.


147
0:5:46,37 --> 0:5:48,78
Just pick off the old remnants
there, it'll


148
0:5:48,78 --> 0:5:49,85
be perfectly fine.


149
0:5:49,85 --> 0:5:51,56
Close it up, we're going
to make a window


150
0:5:51,56 --> 0:5:52,84
inside here as well.


151
0:5:52,84 --> 0:5:55,46
To do that, I'm going to take a
ruler and measure a two inch


152
0:5:55,46 --> 0:5:57,74
border all the way around
so I can cut


153
0:5:57,74 --> 0:5:59,22
out the perfect window.


154
0:5:59,22 --> 0:6:0,85
You're going to leave
the back, so that


155
0:6:0,85 --> 0:6:1,63
you don't cut it.


156
0:6:1,63 --> 0:6:3,52
We're going to cut these
three sides.


157
0:6:3,52 --> 0:6:6,57



158
0:6:6,57 --> 0:6:9,875
And bam, done.


159
0:6:9,875 --> 0:6:12,27
This is our flap.


160
0:6:12,27 --> 0:6:14,84
Perfect.


161
0:6:14,84 --> 0:6:17,2
We need some aluminum foil.


162
0:6:17,2 --> 0:6:19,79
We're covering the bottom here,
so it reflects the sun.


163
0:6:19,79 --> 0:6:21,86
We're also going to put
it on the inside


164
0:6:21,86 --> 0:6:23,14
of the flap as well.


165
0:6:23,14 --> 0:6:25,36
We're going to glue both of
these in place, so we really


166
0:6:25,36 --> 0:6:26,85
have a way to be able
to trap the sun's


167
0:6:26,85 --> 0:6:29,27
energy inside our cooker.


168
0:6:29,27 --> 0:6:31,44
So now it's a matter of using
a little glue stick to just


169
0:6:31,44 --> 0:6:34,25
glue the aluminum
foil to the box.


170
0:6:34,25 --> 0:6:39,25



171
0:6:39,25 --> 0:6:40,98
Next thing you're going to need
is a piece of plastic.


172
0:6:40,98 --> 0:6:43,38
These are just pieces of plastic
bag that we opened up


173
0:6:43,38 --> 0:6:44,52
and taped together.


174
0:6:44,52 --> 0:6:47,83
This is going to go over the
opening like this and now


175
0:6:47,83 --> 0:6:50,36
we're going to take packing
tape and you're


176
0:6:50,36 --> 0:6:51,16
going to seal the edges.


177
0:6:51,16 --> 0:6:53,57
We want to trap as much of that
solar energy in the box


178
0:6:53,57 --> 0:6:54,94
as possible.


179
0:6:54,94 --> 0:6:57,77
Just as we saw with the UV
beads, the solar energy can go


180
0:6:57,77 --> 0:6:59,48
through the plastic with
no problem at all.


181
0:6:59,48 --> 0:7:1,7
We just want to be able to trap
that energy inside the


182
0:7:1,7 --> 0:7:4,94
box and not allow that heat
to come back out.


183
0:7:4,94 --> 0:7:7,81



184
0:7:7,81 --> 0:7:8,97
Let's see if it worked.


185
0:7:8,97 --> 0:7:11,46
It's a perfect window.


186
0:7:11,46 --> 0:7:14,77
And black absorbs heat, so it
only makes sense to take a


187
0:7:14,77 --> 0:7:18,17
black square of paper and put
it right here, on the very


188
0:7:18,17 --> 0:7:20,67
bottom, to be able to
concentrate the heat here is


189
0:7:20,67 --> 0:7:21,88
very, very center.


190
0:7:21,88 --> 0:7:24,47
So all the reflected light goes
right here to the center


191
0:7:24,47 --> 0:7:27,0
and this will be our
cooking surface.


192
0:7:27,0 --> 0:7:28,57
Glue it down and you're
ready to go.


193
0:7:28,57 --> 0:7:37,89



194
0:7:37,89 --> 0:7:39,275
But there is one more problem.


195
0:7:39,275 --> 0:7:42,8
And that is, this lid
won't stay open.


196
0:7:42,8 --> 0:7:45,21
But I've got a solution
for that.


197
0:7:45,21 --> 0:7:47,584
Higginsworth.


198
0:7:47,584 --> 0:7:49,5
In a little bit more.


199
0:7:49,5 --> 0:7:51,7
Perfect.


200
0:7:51,7 --> 0:7:52,49
Fixed.


201
0:7:52,49 --> 0:7:55,15
So let's say you don't have a
Higginsworth, that's where


202
0:7:55,15 --> 0:7:56,62
this skewer comes in.


203
0:7:56,62 --> 0:7:57,38
Watch.


204
0:7:57,38 --> 0:8:2,196
You put the tape in place like
this, and now, you lift it up,


205
0:8:2,196 --> 0:8:5,64
and it rests right there.


206
0:8:5,64 --> 0:8:6,96
Voila.


207
0:8:6,96 --> 0:8:7,96
Let's review.


208
0:8:7,96 --> 0:8:10,35
The object you want to
cook goes inside.


209
0:8:10,35 --> 0:8:14,46
Now, the reflective part gets
folded down here, the handy


210
0:8:14,46 --> 0:8:17,76
dandy adjustable reflector gets
opened up, positioned


211
0:8:17,76 --> 0:8:21,35
perfectly to catch all of the
sun's rays, this gets held


212
0:8:21,35 --> 0:8:25,23
right in place, and you've got
yourself a solar cooker.


213
0:8:25,23 --> 0:8:27,61
So now, let's head back
out to our campgrounds


214
0:8:27,61 --> 0:8:29,49
and see if it works.


215
0:8:29,49 --> 0:8:33,22
In the wilds of pristine,
beautiful Colorado.


216
0:8:33,22 --> 0:8:34,7
Nobody around.


217
0:8:34,7 --> 0:8:37,179
Takes me hours to get there.


218
0:8:37,179 --> 0:8:38,855
Don't even see any wildlife.


219
0:8:38,855 --> 0:8:42,58
It's just me, my cooker,
and my tent.


220
0:8:42,58 --> 0:8:48,59
And my iPhone and a computer
and an iPad.


221
0:8:48,59 --> 0:8:49,4
That's it.


222
0:8:49,4 --> 0:8:50,806
That's all I need.


223
0:8:50,806 --> 0:8:55,5
And a cooler, and
a propane tank.


224
0:8:55,5 --> 0:8:58,5
That's pretty much all I need.


225
0:8:58,5 --> 0:8:59,915
And some Taco Bell,
just in case.


226
0:8:59,915 --> 0:9:2,92
I get hungry.


227
0:9:2,92 --> 0:9:4,17
That's all I need.


228
0:9:4,17 --> 0:9:17,67



229
0:9:17,67 --> 0:9:19,59
Oh, Higginsworth,
my ice melted.


230
0:9:19,59 --> 0:9:22,19
Can you get me some more ice?


231
0:9:22,19 --> 0:9:23,75
On me please, right on me.


232
0:9:23,75 --> 0:9:26,95
Thank you.


233
0:9:26,95 --> 0:9:27,57
Can you hurry?


234
0:9:27,57 --> 0:9:30,315
I'm really hot.


235
0:9:30,315 --> 0:9:30,76
Ding.


236
0:9:30,76 --> 0:9:35,63
Mmm, mmm, it's done, and it
only took 3 and 1/2 hours.


237
0:9:35,63 --> 0:9:38,42
Lucky for me, I was wearing
plenty of sunscreen.


238
0:9:38,42 --> 0:9:59,288



239
0:9:59,288 --> 0:10:0,79
No need for this anymore.


240
0:10:0,79 --> 0:10:5,29



241
0:10:5,29 --> 0:10:6,54
Perfect.


242
0:10:6,54 --> 0:10:13,69



243
0:10:13,69 --> 0:10:15,49
Perfect.


244
0:10:15,49 --> 0:10:16,74
Two more.


245
0:10:16,74 --> 0:12:16,74
