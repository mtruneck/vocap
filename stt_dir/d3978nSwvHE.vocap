###0 First of all, I think I'm in love.
###2 Why is it all right for you to have a boyfriend but not for me?
###6 So long as you live under my roof, you live by my rules.
###9 Finn's got an admirer.
###10 Who would even send a love letter? That is so stupid.
###14 Keep your voice down. This is where I work.
###17 Don't tell me to keep my voice down.
###21 Either we're friends or we're not friends.
###24 Maybe... I don't want to be your friend.
###28 We are...
###29 Married!
###31 Can I tell you something?
###33 It was me who sent the letter to Finn.
###41 Don't mention Friday to anyone.
###43 Why are you looking at me?
###45 I'm looking at everyone.
###47 Don't tell your brothers, don't tell your sisters,
###50 don't even tell knobheads from school.
###52 At the end of the day...
###53 'Whatever, Chop.
###54 'Dear Diary, the fight for Finn's delicious heart has begun.'
###59 'In the red corner, Chloe.
###61 'Seen here looking at Finn like a black widow
###64 'sizing up how much Gaviscon she's going to need
###67 'after eating him whole.
###69 'In the blue corner, see me.
###73 'Finn is so out of my league
###75 ;that no-one would ever even suspect I liked him.
###79 'Nay, loved him.
###81 'But since we had had that amazing heart-to-heart at the party,
###86 'my odds have shortened massively.'
###89 This Friday is between the six of us.
###91 Put it in the vault, people. Lock it in the fucking vault.
###96 'We've even developed a secret mode of communication.'
###107 'I had to use every ounce of my willpower
###110 'not to move his hand over just a few inches
###112 'and ask him to write out all of War And Peace.'
###115 Here you are, check out this bad ass!
###118 Oh, my God!
###120 Hi, Rae. Hi, Chloe. Hi, everyone.
###123 Hi.
###126 What are you doing here?
###127 I'm booking the function room for Saturday.
###131 Oh, Rae's friends. This is my new husband, Karim.
###135 Congratulations.
###136 Pleased to meet you.
###138 We're getting the marriage blessed and then we're gonna come here
###141 and have the reception afterwards.
###142 - You're all invited, of course. - They can't, they're busy.
###145 We're not busy at all. That's wonderful, Mrs Earl.
###147 Congratulations.
###149 Thank you, Chloe. But actually, my name is Mrs Bouchtat now.
###153 Oh, Bouchtat.
###154 Does that mean your name is Rae Bouchtat?
###157 - No, it doesn't. - This is so exciting.
###160 We can use it as a wind-down session after the rave.
###166 What did you say?
###167 Nothing.
###171 Did she say "rave"?

###213 How many calories a minute does high-intensity sex burn?
###215 18.
###217 How long would I have to have sex to burn off a six-pack of Wagon Wheels?
###219 - Jammy or normal? - Jammy.
###221 Jammy Wagon Wheels are 167 cal.
###224 Six are 1,002.
###226 18 cal a minute... Just under an hour.
###228 Ooh! Maybe I should get Dr Nick to cancel his one o'clock.
###232 Hand jobs are supposed to be exhausting too.
###235 I've heard you sometimes have to change arms halfway through.
###237 So what you're saying is I could essentially sex myself thin.
###242 Well, you could eat two roast dinners, have sex for an hour,
###246 throw in a couple of hand jobs and you'd actually be in minus calories.
###249 What is not to like? Where do I sign?
###251 What day is it?
###253 It's Wednesday, 21 August 1996.
###260 'Dear Diary, I want to be more like Rae.
###263 'Then my life would be full of things like boys.
###269 'Rather than things like how many calories things contain.
###272 'And how to lose those calories.'
###280 I want you to try to drink at least two of these a day.
###283 They taste like tar.
###284 Tix, your BMI has dropped again.
###286 It's dropped significantly.
###288 You've become in danger of falling very ill, OK?
###290 There is a risk of organ failure, of heart problems, hormone problems,
###294 problems with your brain.
###298 Angie says you're refusing solids.
###300 I don't like people watching me eat.
###301 You are on supervised eating, Tix.
###303 It's her job to watch you eat.
###307 If you don't start eating in the next few days,
###309 if your weight doesn't stabilise,
###311 I'll have to put you on a tube feed, Tix.
###315 I really, really don't want to have to do that.
###319 Do you understand?
###320 Yeah.
###327 So how have you been since our last session?
###333 Are you scared?
###337 You have to let go, Tix.
###342 It's OK to lose control... sometimes.
###345 You don't have to worry all the time,
###347 you don't have to count calories.
###350 Tell me something that makes you feel good.
###355 Anything.
###358 Rae.
###359 Rae, great.
###360 So, supposing I set up a date between you and Rae for dinner.
###368 She'd like that. I'd like that.
###372 It would have to be Rae, though.
###373 Hm.
###376 Because I said no and that means no.
###379 But everyone's going.
###381 It's not like an illegal rave anyway. It's more like a big dance event.
###385 You're not going.
###386 I know sometimes I tell you to do things and you ignore me, right,
###391 well, this isn't going to be one of those times.
###393 Anyway, what do you think Kester would say
###396 if you told him you were going to a rave?
###398 He'd say, "Go for it." I know Kester.
###401 And he would love the idea of me enjoying myself.
###405 Cos he's not a complete ball-breaker.
###406 Thank you, I'm not deaf.
###408 Right, how does it look?
###419 Oh, great!
###420 I look like a cross between a profiterole and a prolapsed colon.
###425 I love it, I absolutely love it.
###432 Mmm.
###434 Oh!
###436 Well, what about this one?
###437 It's too expensive.
###439 But I love it.
###440 If everyone is going to be there, I have to look nice.
###444 Right, Rae, when I say no to something,
###446 it doesn't mean keep arguing,
###447 it means end of discussion!
###452 I think I'm going to be sick.
###454 Oh, don't be so dramatic.
###460 'You always wonder what it would be like to sit in front of a doctor
###464 'and hear the worst possible news.
###466 'How you'd cope, how you'd feel.'
###470 Rae, I'm afraid you're going to have to stop drinking alcohol.
###473 Why?
###474 The meds we switched you to, some people feel nauseous
###477 if they drink on them, especially at first.
###478 - Right, so it's nothing serious. - What?
###481 I want to go back to the old ones.
###483 No, I wasn't happy with the SSRIs. You said they make you feel drowsy.
###486 I'd rather feel drowsy than feel sick.
###488 No, it's fine, she can just give up the booze.
###490 - This is bullshit. - Rae!
###493 We can review your meds in the next few weeks,
###495 but changing them or stopping them now is not a good idea.
###501 Oh, Dr Nick, I meant to say. I got married last week.
###505 Oh, wow, great, congratulations!
###507 Are we all right?
###509 Yeah.
###513 Ohh!
###519 'When you're sick, you don't belong to yourself any more.
###523 'You don't get a say.
###525 'Every doctor is another parent, every ward another classroom,
###529 'every pill another piece of their bollocks that you have to swallow.'
###547 'So that was it. No booze
###549 'because of my pills and no rave because of my cowbag of a mum.'
###566 'You never know, maybe the rave would be shit.
###574 'Who was I kidding?
###576 'It was gonna be fuckin' amazing. The perfect opportunity
###580 'to lick the fillings from his teeth,
###582 'to suck on his fingers, to grab hold of his firm...'
###585 Rae, what are you thinking about?
###589 I'm thinking...
###591 how I'm going to tell you that you smell of BO.
###595 I'm sure you'll find something to say.
###598 Oh, shit! There's Kendo.
###602 Who's Kendo?
###604 Some twat dealer from Dalehead.
###606 Do I look all right?
###608 What do you mean, "Do I look all right"? He's a scumbag.
###613 All right, ladies?
###615 All right, Chopper?
###616 All right, Kendo?
###617 Tell your fuckin' brother I'm gonna smash his face in when I see him
###623 I'm only joking. How is the cunt?
###625 He's all right.
###628 Do you want some pills for Friday?
###630 Yeah, yeah, sounds good.
###631 Drop round tomorrow and I'll see what I can do for you.
###635 In a bit. See you later, girls.
###643 What are you getting drugs for?
###646 - It's a rave, innit? - Finn, can I get a ride on the back of your scooter?
###649 Yeah, course, no problem.
###651 There's room for you to all go in the one car.
###654 What are you talking about?
###655 I'm not going.
###657 What? Why?
###659 Is it because of your mum?
###662 I'm not going if Rae's not going.
###663 I'm not going if Rae's not going.
###665 Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no. No-one is backing out of this.
###668 Rae?
###669 Come here.
###674 Rae, what's going on?
###678 My mum won't let me go.
###679 Rae, listen to everyone.
###682 You've got to go.
###684 Right, you're always being reminded about how sick you were.
###688 It's just making you worse.
###689 You even said yourself, you're getting better.
###696 You know, you and Finn are getting close.
###699 Yeah. He's a good laugh.
###701 Does he ever mention me?
###704 I don't know really.
###706 What do you reckon he'd do if I tried to kiss him?
###708 How should I know what he'd do?
###710 Can you imagine sleeping with him?
###713 You'd need a fucking bib.
###714 That's disgusting.
###717 It's what you said about Jarvis Cocker last week.
###719 - It's still disgusting. - Well, you're disgusting.
###721 Right, I'm off. Rae, come round to mine tomorrow if you want.
###724 Why?
###726 Because I've got some really crap reggae I want to show you.
###729 And you can give me some personal hygiene tips.
###740 'Round one to me.'
###743 Rachel, come name... Special bird for you.
###746 No, thanks.
###747 Oh, Rae, come and name a bird.
###752 Oh!
###754 Ah! What's the matter with you?
###757 You're not still in a mood, are you, about that rave?
###760 I'd like to see Kester's face
###761 if he thought I was letting you go to a rave.
###763 Stop pretending like you know him. I already told you,
###766 he wants me to have a life.
###769 Are you going to name this bird or not?
###772 You know, they might not even like each other
###774 and you've got them all cooped up together.
###776 - Well, a lot of us have to live like that, so... - It doesn't make it right.
###779 You shouldn't cage up wild animals.
###781 Just name the bird!
###782 Fine!
###788 He's called Mandela.
###790 Mandela.
###792 That's like Nelson.
###794 I like.
###804 'So are you go to the rave tomorrow?'
###806 It doesn't look like it.
###807 Will you go out with me?
###809 Where?
###810 'In the hospital. A dinner date.'
###812 I'm going to try and have some proper food.
###815 'Kester says I need to lose control.'
###817 Oh, I love Kester for saying that.
###819 How do I lose control?
###822 Do something that you've always wanted to do,
###826 but you've been too scared of.
###831 Can you think of anything?
###833 Maybe.
###840 Hiya, Tix. Hiya.
###842 What are you up to?
###843 A bit of admin.
###850 Do you fancy going to the lake with me later?
###853 Me? Yeah.
###854 OK. Cool. What time?
###856 - Four-ish? - Four-ish, OK, cool.
###865 'Even his house was a bit sexy.
###867 'Oh, God, stop!
###869 'No craziness. Stop the craziness.
###873 'I'm breathing too deep.
###875 'I'm hyperventilating.
###877 'Put your hands on something flat.'
###881 I pulled a hamstring. Just stretching it out.
###885 Come up to my room.
###886 If my dad sees you, he'll bend your ear for weeks.
###892 'His bedroom?
###893 'My God!
###895 'This was it.
###899 'About to enter the lion's den.'
###912 Hi.
###916 'Round two.'
###919 Well, I didn't want to miss out on listening to some reggae.
###922 Yeah, cos you love reggae.
###924 I don't particularly like any type of music best.
###926 I just like good music.
###928 You know.
###934 Finn, I love this song.
###935 Who do you like best, Chloe?
###938 Morrissey, or the lead singer of the Smiths?
###941 Well, it depends what mood I'm in.
###945 What?
###946 'In your face, Chloe!'
###950 Right, who wants a beer?
###951 - I will. - Rae?
###954 - No, I'm all right. - Serious?
###955 Come on, Rea. Don't be boring.
###959 Don't be a weirdo.
###975 'I can't believe I asked a boy out.
###977 'Finally, I'm going to be able to talk to Rea about kissing
###980 'and sex things and flirting and love.'
###983 'Just like a normal girl.
###993 'Maybe I can be normal.'
###1023 So what about Rae, then? Is your mum not letting you go?
###1027 It's complicated.
###1028 It would be shit if you don't come.
###1030 Well, the rest of the gang are still going.
###1032 You're still going to have a good time.
###1034 The rest of the gang would fall apart if you're not there.
###1036 You are the gang. No, I mean that, Rae.
###1040 Everyone else has got too much stuff going on.
###1042 You're the most, you know, normal.
###1044 That's bollocks.
###1046 It's true!
###1048 Anyway, you've got to go. I won't take no for an answer because...
###1051 Because what?
###1084 - Are you OK? - No, I just, um...
###1086 What's up?
###1089 I don't feel very well.
###1090 Well, d'you want me to see if my dad will give you a lift home?
###1096 'Oh, God! No vomitorium!'
###1099 You'll like this.
###1101 I got really bladdered at a Status Quo concert once.
###1117 'Round two to Chloe.'
###1121 'Just relax.
###1123 'He's just a boy.
###1126 'Rae would say something funny.
###1129 'Maybe I should tell a joke?
###1131 'No.
###1132 'Don't tell any jokes.
###1134 'Just make conversation.'
###1136 What do you want to talk about?
###1141 Ducks.
###1142 They're one of my favourite things, ducks.
###1146 I mean, when you think about a duck, they're just so...
###1149 chilled out.
###1150 They're not chilled out. I've seen them fight.
###1153 Yeah, but once they've done flapping their wings
###1155 and splashing about and stuff,
###1156 they just go back to being so... chilled out.
###1162 - Hey, d'you know what we should do? - What?
###1164 We should become ducks.
###1166 We'd go into the pond.
###1174 Danny, no, they'll see you from the windows.
###1177 I fear nothing.
###1184 Come on, then.
###1188 'Lose control.
###1192 'Let go.
###1194 'Lose control.
###1196 'Let go.
###1199 'Lose control.
###1200 'Let go.
###1201 'Lose control.
###1203 'Let go.
###1204 'Lose control.'
###1210 Come on.
###1224 Oh, shit!
###1228 'Fucking pills! Fucking doctors!
###1231 'How was I supposed to compete for Finn when I couldn't go anywhere,
###1236 'couldn't do anything?
###1243 'At least there was one adult on the planet who understood.'
###1246 It's a load of crap.
###1248 I mean, I'm 16.
###1250 Everyone else is going.
###1252 And she's all like, "Oh, you can't go because you're different.
###1255 "You shouldn't be exposing yourself to that kind of situation."
###1260 She even used you in an argument.
###1262 "Oh, think of what Kester would say."
###1265 What did she think I'd say?
###1267 She said that you would think it was a bad idea.
###1270 But she doesn't know about everything we talk about in here.
###1273 She doesn't know about all the work we've done
###1276 on me being brave and confident.
###1278 She just reminds me that I'm ill all the time.
###1281 I agree with your mum.
###1283 I think it's a terrible idea.
###1286 You don't think that.
###1287 You're recovering from a serious illness.
###1289 If you'd broken your leg,
###1290 would you try and run a marathon two months later?
###1296 Do you still think I'm a mess, then?
###1298 I don't think you're a mess.
###1300 I think you need to take care of yourself.
###1302 I need to take myself?
###1309 Who were you arguing with?
###1312 Last week in the car park.
###1314 I saw you.
###1317 Was it your wife?
###1320 How am I supposed to listen to someone
###1322 whose life is a bigger mess than mine?
###1325 What is even the point of these sessions, seriously?
###1328 To find out what pushed you over the edge
###1330 and to stop it from happening again.
###1332 Oh, you're always asking questions.
###1334 "Why did you hurt yourself? Why did you go crazy?"
###1336 Sometimes there is no why. I just did.
###1339 And being here and being asked about it every bloody day
###1343 is what's keeping it alive.
###1345 Look, I know this is painful...
###1347 Are you even listening to me?
###1354 I was bored.
###1357 I was lonely.
###1359 I had no mates.
###1361 Now I'm finally popular.
###1366 And you just want to make me feel different again.
###1372 I don't want to come here any more.
###1374 You are not obliged to come here, Rae.
###1376 But I think it would be a bad idea.
###1379 I think we're making some real... progress here. I think...
###1381 What would happen if I walked out of the door right now
###1384 and never came back?
###1387 Aren't you going to try and say something insightful to make me stay?
###1393 Do you think perhaps...
###1396 ..your anger is born out of frustration with yourself?
###1399 That you're angry and frustrated with yourself for being ill?
###1406 You see, that is not something you are entirely responsible for.
###1451 I don't half bloody love you, beastie.
###1509 'Friday, the 23rd of August.
###1512 'Dear Diary...
###1519 'Oh, bollocks to it!'
###1528 Morning.
###1538 Morning.
###1545 What?
###1579 What happened?
###1582 What happened?
###1584 Someone let all the birds out of the cage.
###1587 That's what happened.
###1589 Who did?
###1591 Why would someone do such a thing? I don't know.
###1595 Maybe you could tell me why someone would do such a thing.
###1598 Oh, my...!
###1600 Do you want to tell me why you did it?
###1602 Well, I didn't know that they'd die.
###1605 Well, what did you think they'd do? Fly back to the Bahamas?
###1608 Check in at the local RSPB?
###1610 Karim is in bits.
###1613 He built this because he doesn't know many people here.
###1616 He wanted a project, something nice, so he didn't feel so trapped.
###1620 I did it because they shouldn't be in a cage.
###1622 They're birds, they're not toys.
###1623 No, you did it to get back at me
###1626 for not letting you go to the rave, didn't you?
###1629 Well, is it any wonder I won't let you go when you do things like this?
###1632 When you behave like a mental case?
###1634 Don't call me a mental case.
###1637 But... you know what I meant. Don't you ever
###1640 call me a fuckin' mental case.
###1641 Don't talk to me like that, Rae. I'm your mum.
###1644 I meant you need to start behaving like an adult
###1648 instead of behaving like a child. Yeah?
###1650 Well, maybe you need to start behaving like my mum instead of
###1654 behaving like a twat.
###1660 Oh, I'm sorry, Rae.
###1662 Save it.
###1679 Where are you going?
###1681 I don't know, anywhere.
###1683 Away from you, away from him.
###1685 Rae, don't go. Let's talk about this.
###1687 I'm really sorry.
###1690 Why don't you slap me and then we're even?
###1693 I don't want to slap you.
###1696 I don't even want to look at you.
###1712 'I'd always known I'd have to run away from home at some point.
###1716 'I'd always planned that I don't stop at Chloe's.
###1719 'We'd be like sisters. I'd have a normal family.'
###1725 'But things change.'
###1751 There you go.
###1755 Tea makes everything all right.
###1760 I reckon it'll be all right, you know, in a couple of days.
###1763 When you've both had some space or whatever.
###1768 Thanks for letting me stop.
###1769 It's all right.
###1771 My dad's ironing the sheets for the spare room as we speak.
###1774 Oh, please don't let him do that.
###1775 I wouldn't try and stop him.
###1779 So what time's the rave?
###1780 We'll probably set off in about an hour.
###1782 Why, are you thinking of coming?
###1784 No. No, I'm not.
###1788 It would mess up all the lifts and stuff anyway.
###1790 Would it bollocks, no! I'll tell Chloe to jump in with Chop.
###1792 And you can get on the scooter with me.
###1802 'I can't even dip my toe in a pond.
###1804 'I can't even lose control enough to get my feet wet.
###1808 'I'll never be normal.
###1809 'I'll never be able to talk to Rae about kissing and flirting and love.
###1813 'I'll never be like...'
###1815 - Rae? - It's me.
###1818 What are you doing in here?
###1820 Hiding.
###1821 Why, what are you doing in here?
###1823 Hiding.
###1826 I thought you'd be getting ready your big date with Rae.
###1831 I'm not going.
###1833 Please don't try and convince me to go.
###1837 I once treated a young boy, he was about seven years old.
###1843 He used to pull down on his testicles whenever he was upset.
###1846 I mean really yank down, it was truly eye-watering to behold.
###1851 Then one day, I asked him a difficult question.
###1855 He pulled down so hard upon them that he had to go to hospital.
###1860 That's crazy.
###1863 You'd be surprised what lengths people will go to
###1866 not to face what's real
###1867 and painful inside them.
###1870 But then, that's what my job is.
###1873 I'm essentially a torturer.
###1876 This is where you say that I'm not a torturer,
###1878 that I'm actually quite lovely.
###1881 My methods of torture are asking you to trust people.
###1885 Asking you to lose control.
###1887 But if I'd been treated the way you have been treated by people...
###1892 ..I'd want to sit in a toilet
###1894 and hide away from the rest of the world as well.
###1896 You are sitting in a toilet.
###1900 It's really quite nice, actually.
###1902 I can see why you and Rae hang out here.
###1905 I do trust people, you know.
###1908 I trust Rae.
###1910 Well, then maybe you should have dinner with her.
###2028 Are you all right?
###2030 Listen, try and have a good night. Enjoy yourself.
###2034 Er, what's going on with you two?
###2036 What do you mean? You look like a couple.
###2038 Come on, Chloe, we look like a better couple than they do.
###2065 I've got one for everyone.
###2068 You fucking know this, come on.
###2071 Finn? No, I'm all right.
###2073 Chloe? No way.
###2075 What are you doing? Taking a pill.
###2077 What, you hate drugs. You don't take drugs.
###2079 You said there was one for everyone.
###2081 Not for you, you're different.
###2082 Why am I different? Rae, are you in?
###2087 Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines.
###2095 What's the point in keeping a diary
###2097 when you're too scared to even do anything?
###2100 When your life is boring?
###2102 When the only things you know are how many calories things contain?
###2108 And how to lose them?
###2139 Oh, my God, Rae! I can't believe you dropped a pill.
###2143 Yeah, well, you're the one that told me to chill.
###2147 So, how's things going with Finn?
###2151 OK.
###2152 Are you staying at his tonight?
###2154 Yeah.
###2156 But it's a long story.
###2157 But you like him? What, Finn?
###2160 No! We're just best mates.
###2163 I really want to kiss him, but I don't know...
###2166 I think he likes someone else.
###2168 Who?
###2170 I'm not too sure.
###2172 Has he said anything to you?
###2174 No.
###2175 Maybe I won't try then.
###2179 Whoo!
###2181 Archie, come here.
###2189 If you were a bloke, I'd shag your lights out.
###2193 Yeah. And if I was a bloke, I'd let you.

###2267 I'm single, are you?
###2270 Are you here with someone?
###2272 No. I'm not single.
###2275 You can be single if you want.
###2287 Rae, Rae, come here. Come here.
