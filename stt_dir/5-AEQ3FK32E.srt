1
0:0:3,328 --> 0:0:6,941
I'm on the phone with Jim on
one of our regular check-ins.


2
0:0:6,941 --> 0:0:8,948
Jim, nothing's happening..


3
0:0:8,948 --> 0:0:12,48
It's starting Adam, I think.
Adam, it's starting.


4
0:0:12,48 --> 0:0:19,161
Look at that! Look at
that little thing.


5
0:0:19,161 --> 0:0:22,653
It all started in Iceland. I think I'm
so certain to get what I'll take


6
0:0:22,653 --> 0:0:26,396
my boots off.


7
0:0:26,396 --> 0:0:30,998
I never imagined that you could see
glaciers this big disappearing in such


8
0:0:30,998 --> 0:0:35,268
a short time. There's a powerful piece
of history that's unfolding in these


9
0:0:35,268 --> 0:0:39,22
pictures and I have to go back.


10
0:0:39,22 --> 0:0:43,41
The initial goal was to put out 25
cameras for 3 years and shoot every


11
0:0:43,41 --> 0:0:45,645
hour as long as it was daylight.
That would show you how


12
0:0:45,645 --> 0:0:48,386
the landscape was changing.


13
0:0:48,386 --> 0:0:50,613
Ahh this is the way to
travel my friend.


14
0:0:50,613 --> 0:0:54,785
Putting really delicate electronics in
the harshest conditions on the planet.


15
0:0:54,785 --> 0:0:58,56
It's not the nicest
environment for technology.


16
0:0:58,56 --> 0:1:0,731
I do not want to go
any lower than this.


17
0:1:0,731 --> 0:1:4,395
It's just bottomless. I'm going out
here on this broken fin and I assume


18
0:1:4,395 --> 0:1:10,71
it won't collapse.


19
0:1:10,71 --> 0:1:13,138
Every once in a while, I get to
saying what were we thinking?


20
0:1:13,138 --> 0:1:18,215
Maybe that office job wasn't so bad.


21
0:1:18,215 --> 0:1:19,445
This thing is loose.


22
0:1:19,445 --> 0:1:20,148
Rock!


23
0:1:20,148 --> 0:1:21,48
- It's not working.
- God!


24
0:1:21,48 --> 0:1:24,42
All of that obsession means
nothing if it doesn't work.


25
0:1:24,42 --> 0:1:26,876
Just be careful. Don't get too
close to the edge, alright?


26
0:1:26,876 --> 0:1:30,878
It's terrifying!


27
0:1:30,878 --> 0:1:33,835
This knee has had two surgeries
and I really could use a third.


28
0:1:33,835 --> 0:1:35,391
He goes to that point
where he can't anymore


29
0:1:35,391 --> 0:1:43,371
and sometimes he's going further.


30
0:1:43,371 --> 0:1:45,438
This is big stuff happening right now.


31
0:1:45,438 --> 0:1:58,861
Okay, onward.


32
0:1:58,861 --> 0:2:1,623
This is the memory of the landscape.
That landscape is gone.


33
0:2:1,623 --> 0:2:3,988
It may never be seen again
in the history of civilization


34
0:2:3,988 --> 0:4:3,988
and it's stored right here.
