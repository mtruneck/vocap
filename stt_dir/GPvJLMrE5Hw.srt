4
0:0:13,19 --> 0:0:15,37
SHANE SMITH: Now because Colonia
Lebaron is so close to


5
0:0:15,37 --> 0:0:18,19
the American border, they're
totally affected by our


6
0:0:18,19 --> 0:0:21,23
immigration policy and, of
course, our war on drugs.


7
0:0:21,23 --> 0:0:24,55
If America sneezes, Mexico
catches cold.


8
0:0:24,55 --> 0:0:26,55
And because of this, they are
extremely interested in


9
0:0:26,55 --> 0:0:27,83
American political policy.


10
0:0:27,83 --> 0:0:33,5



11
0:0:33,5 --> 0:0:34,92
You have narco cartels.


12
0:0:34,92 --> 0:0:35,57
You have a drug route.


13
0:0:35,57 --> 0:0:37,44
You have illegal immigration.


14
0:0:37,44 --> 0:0:40,39
So all of these problems, who
do you think should be the


15
0:0:40,39 --> 0:0:42,79
next president of the
United States?


16
0:0:42,79 --> 0:0:46,19
BRENT LEBARON: Mitt Romney has
a great, great policy.


17
0:0:46,19 --> 0:0:47,85
SHANE SMITH: Now are you just
saying that because you're


18
0:0:47,85 --> 0:0:49,65
Mormon-ish?


19
0:0:49,65 --> 0:0:51,5
BRENT LEBARON: His
ties, his people.


20
0:0:51,5 --> 0:0:54,46
His family lives right across
the mountain here.


21
0:0:54,46 --> 0:0:55,71
You should probably meet them.


22
0:0:55,71 --> 0:0:58,33
BRENT LEBARON: Now, when Brent
says his family, he means


23
0:0:58,33 --> 0:1:2,1
presidential candidate
Mitt Romney's family.


24
0:1:2,1 --> 0:1:4,68
Now, we knew that his father,
George Romney, had been born


25
0:1:4,68 --> 0:1:7,99
into Mormon colony in Mexico,
but not that they still had an


26
0:1:7,99 --> 0:1:10,11
active Romney colony
here in Chihuahua.


27
0:1:10,11 --> 0:1:14,15
So the Romneys still live
here, across the valley?


28
0:1:14,15 --> 0:1:15,855
BRENT LEBARON: Yep, they're
some great guys.


29
0:1:15,855 --> 0:1:17,61
I just really like them.


30
0:1:17,61 --> 0:1:20,323
Golf with them quite often and--
some really cool guys.

are fours.

How did this golf
course start?


40
0:1:38,56 --> 0:1:40,99
BRENT LEBARON: We just got a
group together that like to


41
0:1:40,99 --> 0:1:44,0
play golf and copied other
golf courses, put in the


42
0:1:44,0 --> 0:1:46,41
sprinkling system.


43
0:1:46,41 --> 0:1:50,0
When the violence started, we
lost quite a few members--


44
0:1:50,0 --> 0:1:55,47
just like in Casas Grandes,
a lot of people moved out.


45
0:1:55,47 --> 0:1:57,59

some of the Lebarons from


46
0:1:57,59 --> 0:1:58,31

0:1:58,31 --> 0:1:59,295
KELLY ROMNEY: Yeah, some
of the guys come


48
0:1:59,295 --> 0:2:0,15
over here and play.

the Lebarons or the Romneys?

the Romneys been here?

0:2:14,78 --> 0:2:15,81
KELLY ROMNEY: 1885.


58
0:2:15,81 --> 0:2:19,9
My great grandfather, Miles
Park Romney was one of the


59
0:2:19,9 --> 0:2:22,13
original people that
came here.


60
0:2:22,13 --> 0:2:23,3
Mitt is a relative.


61
0:2:23,3 --> 0:2:24,49
He's a second cousin.


62
0:2:24,49 --> 0:2:26,61
SHANE SMITH: So his dad
was born in Chihuahua.


63
0:2:26,61 --> 0:2:29,12
Yeah, he was born in Colonia
Dublan, about


64
0:2:29,12 --> 0:2:30,89
15 miles from here.


65
0:2:30,89 --> 0:2:33,33
Their family left, and they
stayed in the United States.


66
0:2:33,33 --> 0:2:34,47
They didn't come back.


67
0:2:34,47 --> 0:2:37,532
You know, I remember his father
ran for President of


68
0:2:37,532 --> 0:2:40,43
the United States in '68, at
least he was a candidate.


69
0:2:40,43 --> 0:2:44,33
His citizenship was questioned
because he was born here in


70
0:2:44,33 --> 0:2:47,14
Mexico but he was born
of America parents.


71
0:2:47,14 --> 0:2:50,23
SHANE SMITH: Do you think that
this craziness around the


72
0:2:50,23 --> 0:2:52,11
run-up to the election, is that


73
0:2:52,11 --> 0:2:54,11
bringing too much attention?


74
0:2:54,11 --> 0:2:56,98
KELLY ROMNEY: I think one of the
reasons it's brought a lot


75
0:2:56,98 --> 0:2:59,82
of attention to here is because
of Mitt's position on


76
0:2:59,82 --> 0:3:1,13
illegal immigration.


77
0:3:1,13 --> 0:3:3,25
SHANE SMITH: Now what's ironic
about this is that Mitt


78
0:3:3,25 --> 0:3:5,83
Romney, whose father was born
in Mexico, and would be


79
0:3:5,83 --> 0:3:8,95
considered the poster child of
the Dream Act, actually has


80
0:3:8,95 --> 0:3:11,71
one of the staunchest views on
immigration in his already


81
0:3:11,71 --> 0:3:13,77
conservative Republican Party.


82
0:3:13,77 --> 0:3:15,2
MITT ROMNEY: And I've indicated
I would veto the


83
0:3:15,2 --> 0:3:18,7
Dream Act if provisions included
that people who are


84
0:3:18,7 --> 0:3:18,94
here illegally--


85
0:3:18,94 --> 0:3:21,48
if they go to school here long
enough, get a degree here,


86
0:3:21,48 --> 0:3:23,37
that they can become permanent
residents.


87
0:3:23,37 --> 0:3:24,24
I think that's a mistake.


88
0:3:24,24 --> 0:3:25,5
[APPLAUSE]


89
0:3:25,5 --> 0:3:27,62
MITT ROMNEY: Now, it seems a bit
weird for a person who's


90
0:3:27,62 --> 0:3:30,98
essentially a first-generation
immigrant to have such harsh


91
0:3:30,98 --> 0:3:32,8
views on immigration.


92
0:3:32,8 --> 0:3:35,38
It's kind of like, me thinks
thy dost protest too


93
0:3:35,38 --> 0:3:38,53
much kind of deal.


94
0:3:38,53 --> 0:3:41,17
And his own cousin Kelly who,
although he supports Mitt for


95
0:3:41,17 --> 0:3:42,96
president, thinks that
his position on


96
0:3:42,96 --> 0:3:45,15
immigration is wrong.


97
0:3:45,15 --> 0:3:46,7
KELLY ROMNEY: I think
he needs to change.


98
0:3:46,7 --> 0:3:49,42
Being born and raised
in Mexico--


99
0:3:49,42 --> 0:3:53,6
and especially since NAFTA, I
think that the United States


100
0:3:53,6 --> 0:3:56,8
is partly responsible for
the increase in illegal


101
0:3:56,8 --> 0:3:57,34
immigration that happened.


102
0:3:57,34 --> 0:3:59,78
SHANE SMITH: So America makes
policy then, all of the


103
0:3:59,78 --> 0:4:1,83
sudden, Northern Mexico
gets all screwed up.


104
0:4:1,83 --> 0:4:2,73
KELLY ROMNEY: That's right.


105
0:4:2,73 --> 0:4:5,19
Give amnesty to those that are
out there that are working


106
0:4:5,19 --> 0:4:6,88
legitimately and have a job.


107
0:4:6,88 --> 0:4:9,845
Come up with a guest worker
program and let these people


108
0:4:9,845 --> 0:4:12,235
go out there and work and then
come home and take care of


109
0:4:12,235 --> 0:4:14,213
their family because, basically,
they're starving to


110
0:4:14,213 --> 0:4:15,28
death here in Mexico.


111
0:4:15,28 --> 0:4:17,6
SHANE SMITH: In fact, it's so
bad that, for many people,


112
0:4:17,6 --> 0:4:19,13
there's only really
two options--


113
0:4:19,13 --> 0:4:23,19
one, sneak into America, or
two, work for the cartels.


114
0:4:23,19 --> 0:4:25,44
Didn't some farmers go up from
the farms and go to the


115
0:4:25,44 --> 0:4:26,85
mountains and start
growing drugs?


116
0:4:26,85 --> 0:4:28,18
KELLY ROMNEY: Yeah, a lot of
them have gone into the


117
0:4:28,18 --> 0:4:30,2
mountain areas, and they
grow of drugs.


118
0:4:30,2 --> 0:4:31,82
SHANE SMITH: And now we're
sitting here, going, OK, well,


119
0:4:31,82 --> 0:4:32,37
what are we going to do.


120
0:4:32,37 --> 0:4:33,9
KELLY ROMNEY: What are
we going to do?


121
0:4:33,9 --> 0:4:35,1
Exactly.


122
0:4:35,1 --> 0:4:36,75
I wish Mitt would make
contact with us.


123
0:4:36,75 --> 0:4:39,75
And I really think that
we could help him.


124
0:4:39,75 --> 0:4:42,0
SHANE SMITH: And as I would
later realize, contacting the


125
0:4:42,0 --> 0:4:44,6
Mexican side of his family would
probably be the last


126
0:4:44,6 --> 0:4:46,27
thing that Mitt Romney
would do.


127
0:4:46,27 --> 0:4:48,9
MITT ROMNEY: We have got to
protect our borders and stop


128
0:4:48,9 --> 0:4:50,47
the flood of illegal
immigration.


129
0:4:50,47 --> 0:4:53,385
And I will not do anything that
opens up another wave of


130
0:4:53,385 --> 0:4:53,96
illegal immigration.


131
0:4:53,96 --> 0:4:57,98

132
0:4:57,98 --> 0:5:0,1
KELLY ROMNEY: When they started
the war on drugs, the


133
0:5:0,1 --> 0:5:2,42
violence just escalated.


134
0:5:2,42 --> 0:5:4,57
To me, this used to be
the most peaceful


135
0:5:4,57 --> 0:5:5,95
place in the world.

watch on it.

been any Romneys kidnapped?
