###21 Hey, what's up?
###21 My name is A-Trak and I'm going to tell you the story of
###24 one of the wildest nights I've had.
###27 Going back to the early years of my DJing, because I had a
###30 bit of a crew, we all got booked in
###33 Houston Halloween weekend.
###35 I went there with my friend, DJ Craze.
###37 We walked off the plane and this girl picked us up--
###40 she was hot.
###41 She takes us to the hotel, and as I mentioned,
###43 it's Halloween weekend.
###44 So she's like, can I change in one of you guys' bathrooms?
###46 We're like, oh yeah, sure.
###47 So she goes into the bathroom and comes out in full-leather
###50 cat woman suit--
###51 I'm like, whoa.
###53 I'm getting a call from my agent.
###54 He's like, your promoter's missing.
###56 We start hanging out in the lobby because we're just
###58 waiting for a call to know where to go.
###60 And in the lobby there was some sort of formal party,
###62 people were wearing suits and stuff and there was a piano.
###66 And lo and behold, [INAUDIBLE]
###68 in Humpty-Hump attire walks up and starts
###70 playing on the piano.
###71 And these girls are getting completely drunk right next to
###74 them, so very strange juxtaposition.
###76 So my agent's like, all right, I think I know
###79 what the venue is.
###80 I don't care if you guys play or not, but I need you to pick
###83 up the money.
###83 So we break up into two cars.
###85 Me and Craze are in the car with the one
###87 chick in the catsuit.
###88 So you see someone with fur boots and someone in neon
###91 attire and a visor hat and you're like, they know.
###94 So we're rolling down the window being like yo, guys,
###96 where's the party?
###96 And they're like, what?
###97 They don't get that we're the DJs.
###99 Like they're trying to not tell us or something.
###101 We went to one spot, there's nothing there.
###102 We go to another spot and we walk into the place, there's a
###106 rave going on, there's a party going on.
###108 I did my DJ set and as soon as I walked offstage, chaos
###112 ensures and the word gets around the
###114 Fire Marshall's here.
###115 People are running in every direction and the party's
###118 getting shut down.
###118 And we're looking for the promoter, and everyone we ask
###121 is sort of like ha, everyone's looking for him.
###123 His buddy comes and finds me, and he's like, yeah, Scott,
###126 had to uh-- go take care of something.
###128 I see the promoter dude actually jump out the window.
###131 Not as a suicide, just to run away-- we're like ah, ah.
###134 My friend, DJ Craze, comes in and finds me.
###137 Like glorious smile, super excited, he's like "I got it."
###139 He managed to hide the little tin container of
###142 cash from the cops.
###143 And the homegirl in the catsuit was like you guys want
###146 to go to another party?
###146 And I'm just like, you guys got to get me to my hotel.
###149 Now the hotel at least had a hot tub in the room.
###152 And I'm going to kick back.
###153 Fuck everything, I'm getting in the hot tub.
###155 And someone's knocking on my door, and I'm sort
###158 of like who is it?
###159 I just throw on a robe and open the door and
###162 be like what's up?
###163 And the homegirl in the catsuit was like dressed in
###165 borderline S&M gear.
###167 I was like, oh man.
###169 I think she had a whip or something.
###170 And that was one of the weirdest nights I've ever had
###172 on the road.
