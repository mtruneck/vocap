0:0:12,1 --> 0:0:14,705
CHRIS HASLAM: We're not sure if
this place has asbestos in


3
0:0:14,705 --> 0:0:15,64
it or whatever.


4
0:0:15,64 --> 0:0:18,14
But if it does, then I think me
and Daewon and [INAUDIBLE]


5
0:0:18,14 --> 0:0:21,49
are probably going to die in
the next couple years.


6
0:0:21,49 --> 0:0:23,91
PATRICK O'DELL: So you're
going to try to film one


7
0:0:23,91 --> 0:0:25,71
continuous line through
this place?


8
0:0:25,71 --> 0:0:26,93
CHRIS HASLAM: Yeah.


9
0:0:26,93 --> 0:0:29,3
But I'm starting up here.


10
0:0:29,3 --> 0:0:35,52
Like [INAUDIBLE] right here,
which, like I said, is


11
0:0:35,52 --> 0:0:36,62
ridiculously steep now.


12
0:0:36,62 --> 0:0:40,24
I didn't think it was going to
be this steep but whatever.


13
0:0:40,24 --> 0:0:43,94
We're coming up this wall right
there, which is another


14
0:0:43,94 --> 0:0:46,48
thing that's retardedly steep.


15
0:0:46,48 --> 0:0:49,243
And we're going to come through
here, this little hole


16
0:0:49,243 --> 0:0:54,364
in the wall, that we probably
won't fit through.


17
0:0:54,364 --> 0:0:56,515
PATRICK O'DELL: How would you
get through there , and then


18
0:0:56,515 --> 0:0:56,91
what happens?


19
0:0:56,91 --> 0:0:59,939
CHRIS HASLAM: We get [INAUDIBLE]
on this thing


20
0:0:59,939 --> 0:1:0,638
right here.


21
0:1:0,638 --> 0:1:2,295
And then I'm coming
through here.


22
0:1:2,295 --> 0:1:5,73



23
0:1:5,73 --> 0:1:8,18
Got to duck under this thing.


24
0:1:8,18 --> 0:1:9,57
PATRICK O'DELL: How
tall are you?


25
0:1:9,57 --> 0:1:12,5
CHRIS HASLAM: Tall enough,
like 6'1".


26
0:1:12,5 --> 0:1:14,4
And then you duck under
this thing.


27
0:1:14,4 --> 0:1:14,97
This is going to be
like the hardest.


28
0:1:14,97 --> 0:1:16,33
This is where I'm going
to probably smoke


29
0:1:16,33 --> 0:1:18,44
my head a few times.


30
0:1:18,44 --> 0:1:20,5
I'm going over this thing.


31
0:1:20,5 --> 0:1:23,41



32
0:1:23,41 --> 0:1:24,38
Under this thing.

0:1:25,35 --> 0:1:28,4
I can't even walk it.

0:1:28,4 --> 0:1:29,7
CHRIS HASLAM: [INAUDIBLE]


36
0:1:29,7 --> 0:1:31,305
yeah, go under it.


37
0:1:31,305 --> 0:1:34,91
And then, front side come
around this corner


38
0:1:34,91 --> 0:1:36,39
[INAUDIBLE].


39
0:1:36,39 --> 0:1:37,89
Over this little wave thing.


40
0:1:37,89 --> 0:1:41,51



41
0:1:41,51 --> 0:1:42,76
Over the wall ride.


42
0:1:42,76 --> 0:1:47,65
And the try to make it from
the wall ride back over up


43
0:1:47,65 --> 0:1:53,71
that bank and that's
a full shot.

[SKATEBOARDING SOUNDS]


45
0:2:41,11 --> 0:2:43,63
PATRICK O'DELL: Welcome back
to the Epicly Later'd show.


46
0:2:43,63 --> 0:2:45,5
This week we have Chris
Haslam on the show.


47
0:2:45,5 --> 0:2:47,69
You know when you see his name
come up and you see him about


48
0:2:47,69 --> 0:2:50,765
to trick, you know it's going to
be just something new that


49
0:2:50,765 --> 0:2:51,86
you've never seen before.


50
0:2:51,86 --> 0:2:56,19
But he can do anything on a
mini ramp or on street.


51
0:2:56,19 --> 0:2:59,49
Everything's just taken to
a whole other level.


52
0:2:59,49 --> 0:3:4,15
Over and over his tricks
kind of blow your mind.


53
0:3:4,15 --> 0:3:6,57
So anyway, this is just a little
bit of an intro into


54
0:3:6,57 --> 0:3:8,26
the mind of Chris Haslam.


55
0:3:8,26 --> 0:3:14,728



56
0:3:14,728 --> 0:3:17,15
CHRIS HASLAM: Amazing
crib, man.


57
0:3:17,15 --> 0:3:18,225
PATRICK O'DELL: This
is your place?


58
0:3:18,225 --> 0:3:19,98
CHRIS HASLAM: This is
my friend Brandon's.


59
0:3:19,98 --> 0:3:23,6
This is where he sleeps.


60
0:3:23,6 --> 0:3:26,96
There's some sort of stain
on the bed there.


61
0:3:26,96 --> 0:3:28,26
This my set-up.

0:3:35,0 --> 0:3:37,393
It doesn't even get over
my whole body.

0:3:37,393 --> 0:3:38,69
PATRICK O'DELL: Who's
this guy?


67
0:3:38,69 --> 0:3:45,15
CHRIS HASLAM: This is Danny
Gonzales's dog, Ginger.


68
0:3:45,15 --> 0:3:48,65
She's one of the most stunning
poms you'll ever see.


69
0:3:48,65 --> 0:3:48,95
Danny.


70
0:3:48,95 --> 0:3:51,866

videos do you have. ?


71
0:3:51,866 --> 0:3:54,45
Lookit, he even has a-- damn--


72
0:3:54,45 --> 0:3:57,4
401, 402.


73
0:3:57,4 --> 0:4:0,6
Obviously, this one is the
finest one he has.

0:4:0,6 --> 0:4:1,58
PATRICK O'DELL: Oh, you're
in there right?


75
0:4:1,58 --> 0:4:2,64
CHRIS HASLAM: I'm
in there, yeah.


76
0:4:2,64 --> 0:4:4,0
PATRICK O'DELL: Whoa,
that 's you?


77
0:4:4,0 --> 0:4:4,89
CHRIS HASLAM: Yeah.

0:4:4,89 --> 0:4:8,926
Look at this, shorts even.


79
0:4:8,926 --> 0:4:10,345
PATRICK O'DELL: How
long ago is this?


80
0:4:10,345 --> 0:4:12,66
CHRIS HASLAM: Gee,
I have no idea.


81
0:4:12,66 --> 0:4:14,31
What is this 2000
and something?


82
0:4:14,31 --> 0:4:15,88
PATRICK O'DELL: So you
just haven't cut


83
0:4:15,88 --> 0:4:16,75
your hair since then?


84
0:4:16,75 --> 0:4:18,43
CHRIS HASLAM: 2002, yeah.


85
0:4:18,43 --> 0:4:20,337
PATRICK O'DELL: What made you
want to grow your beard and


86
0:4:20,337 --> 0:4:21,455
your hair real long?


87
0:4:21,455 --> 0:4:27,3
CHRIS HASLAM: I started the hair
because my buddy Steve in


88
0:4:27,3 --> 0:4:29,18
Canada bet--


89
0:4:29,18 --> 0:4:31,54
I told him I was going to grow
it-- and I guess he didn't


90
0:4:31,54 --> 0:4:32,3
believe me.


91
0:4:32,3 --> 0:4:35,39
So he bet me I couldn't grow it
as long as his or whatever.


92
0:4:35,39 --> 0:4:37,5
Like $50 or something.


93
0:4:37,5 --> 0:4:38,56
Something lame.


94
0:4:38,56 --> 0:4:39,72
And I was like to here.


95
0:4:39,72 --> 0:4:42,6
I think it was in the digital
video where I had--


96
0:4:42,6 --> 0:4:44,38
That's mid transformation.


97
0:4:44,38 --> 0:4:48,31
That's probably the video that
has clips of me in that one


98
0:4:48,31 --> 0:4:49,485
that have the shaved head.


99
0:4:49,485 --> 0:4:52,76
And the next clip is me with
long hair, with some lame-ass


100
0:4:52,76 --> 0:4:55,21
bandana out of my pocket.


101
0:4:55,21 --> 0:4:58,33
And then a real tight-ass
shirt.


102
0:4:58,33 --> 0:5:1,234
So I will put this in.


103
0:5:1,234 --> 0:5:8,1



104

No BMX, no blades ever.

0:5:27,86 --> 0:5:31,11
round in about a year.

Oh.

what I'm doing at this

watch [INAUDIBLE] video?

0:5:57,94 --> 0:5:59,43
being in the woods.

I'm getting sick of it, so I'm
sure everybody else is getting


120
0:6:1,95 --> 0:6:5,74
sick of it too.

stop putting me in

called that you did in


124
0:6:10,43 --> 0:6:12,555
Barcelona over the bump
[INAUDIBLE] bar?


125
0:6:12,555 --> 0:6:14,89
CHRIS HASLAM: I call it
a run [INAUDIBLE].


126
0:6:14,89 --> 0:6:19,17
People that know skate histories
generally know what


127
0:6:19,17 --> 0:6:21,55
I'm talking about
when I say that.


128
0:6:21,55 --> 0:6:24,97
Most of the stuff I've done has
been done before already.


129
0:6:24,97 --> 0:6:27,14
Kick foot, one footed,
nose manual, I seen


130
0:6:27,14 --> 0:6:30,44
Danny Gonzales do that.


131
0:6:30,44 --> 0:6:31,58
Front board, kick flipout.


132
0:6:31,58 --> 0:6:34,28
I saw Chris Cole do that in,
I think, or something


133
0:6:34,28 --> 0:6:35,65
[INAUDIBLE] or whatever.


134
0:6:35,65 --> 0:6:37,95
That one you see when I'm
skating up to that kick-foot,


135
0:6:37,95 --> 0:6:41,35
my shirt is tied around
my pants.


136
0:6:41,35 --> 0:6:45,44
That's because my pants ripped
and my balls were hanging out,


137
0:6:45,44 --> 0:6:50,51
so I had to tie my shirt around
my pants so that I


138
0:6:50,51 --> 0:6:51,67
wouldn't be caught hanging.


139
0:6:51,67 --> 0:6:53,41

a lot of these tricks

0:6:53,41 --> 0:6:54,5

0:6:54,5 --> 0:6:55,21
Or it's like--


142
0:6:55,21 --> 0:6:57,7
CHRIS HASLAM: I've heard people


143
0:6:57,7 --> 0:6:59,82
call them circus tricks.


144
0:6:59,82 --> 0:7:3,332



145
0:7:3,332 --> 0:7:6,1
Like just whenever like, oh
this is kind of weird.


146
0:7:6,1 --> 0:7:10,8
Kind of unusual tricks
or whatever.


147
0:7:10,8 --> 0:7:17,38
Surprisingly, a the three tricks
that people were the


148
0:7:17,38 --> 0:7:20,65
most psyched on was the
kick-foot Smith at the end,


149
0:7:20,65 --> 0:7:24,57
the one- footed board
slide, and the front


150
0:7:24,57 --> 0:7:27,17
blunt on the board.


151
0:7:27,17 --> 0:7:28,74
I think the reason why kids
were psyched on the front


152
0:7:28,74 --> 0:7:32,24
blunt of the board was
because you could do


153
0:7:32,24 --> 0:7:33,72
that any day you want.


154
0:7:33,72 --> 0:7:36,53
You could do it on the front
yard, you can do it on the


155
0:7:36,53 --> 0:7:40,17
driveway, or you could do
it wherever you want.


156
0:7:40,17 --> 0:7:45,84
It's in the reach of any
level of skating.


157
0:7:45,84 --> 0:7:48,26
I'm sure I got hated on a few
times, but I'm surprised that


158
0:7:48,26 --> 0:7:51,44
I haven't just gotten completely
shunned from any


159
0:7:51,44 --> 0:7:55,29
kind of sponsored skating event
from all the lame tricks


160
0:7:55,29 --> 0:7:56,88
that I usually pull off.


161
0:7:56,88 --> 0:7:59,27
There's been a couple, like
the crook lip slide that I


162
0:7:59,27 --> 0:8:3,68
wish never really came
out anywhere, ever.


163
0:8:3,68 --> 0:8:5,31
Oh what's this?


164
0:8:5,31 --> 0:8:6,81
And, oh, there was one dude.


165
0:8:6,81 --> 0:8:10,71
There was a career-ending
photo.


166
0:8:10,71 --> 0:8:12,31
It was the World War Three.


167
0:8:12,31 --> 0:8:15,6
The best trick World
War Three video.


168
0:8:15,6 --> 0:8:19,7
Dude, on the back cover I
had a shaved head, these


169
0:8:19,7 --> 0:8:20,89
baggy ass jeans on--


170
0:8:20,89 --> 0:8:23,56
I don't know what kind of
shirt-- but blazing Benihana.


171
0:8:23,56 --> 0:8:26,14
Like dude!


172
0:8:26,14 --> 0:8:27,55
Just so big.


173
0:8:27,55 --> 0:8:30,435
And just on the back
cover is so devo.


174
0:8:30,435 --> 0:8:33,36



175
0:8:33,36 --> 0:8:35,24
So bad man.


176
0:8:35,24 --> 0:8:37,76
I wouldn't mind doing
another video--


177
0:8:37,76 --> 0:8:40,9
well I don't want to say like
cheese and crackers--


178
0:8:40,9 --> 0:8:41,46
but I want to do that
kind of video.


179
0:8:41,46 --> 0:8:45,35
But not of mini ramp skating,
of doing something else.


180
0:8:45,35 --> 0:8:51,95
I like those kind cheaper, free,
kind of short, and just


181
0:8:51,95 --> 0:8:53,23
fun to watch videos.


182
0:8:53,23 --> 0:8:53,61
You know?


183
0:8:53,61 --> 0:8:57,19
Because I think people want
to see fun stuff now.


184
0:8:57,19 --> 0:8:59,51
I've been skating with
Daewon for a bit.


185
0:8:59,51 --> 0:9:3,28
And there'd be the demo or
there'd be like a mini ramp at


186
0:9:3,28 --> 0:9:4,93
the park that we'd
go to and stuff.


187
0:9:4,93 --> 0:9:7,8
So we'd be skating mini ramps.


188
0:9:7,8 --> 0:9:11,53
So we knew the skill level
of each other.


189
0:9:11,53 --> 0:9:15,74
And we just, one day, thought
that we might as well, maybe,


190
0:9:15,74 --> 0:9:16,62
make something.


191
0:9:16,62 --> 0:9:17,54
You know?


192
0:9:17,54 --> 0:9:19,44
Like make a ramp video.


193
0:9:19,44 --> 0:9:24,57
We wanted it to be as homemade
as possible.


194
0:9:24,57 --> 0:9:26,32
There was all kinds of
stuff that we built


195
0:9:26,32 --> 0:9:29,66
and tried to get.


196
0:9:29,66 --> 0:9:31,71
But there was no way.


197
0:9:31,71 --> 0:9:34,38
There was one part of the
extension that I built.


198
0:9:34,38 --> 0:9:39,18
Kind of like a bridge to the
wall with coping on it.


199
0:9:39,18 --> 0:9:41,27
I don't know what the hell I was
thinking because it's not


200
0:9:41,27 --> 0:9:42,3
going to happen.


201
0:9:42,3 --> 0:9:44,365
So there was all kinds of stuff
that we built that we


202
0:9:44,365 --> 0:9:45,7
didn't even skate.


203
0:9:45,7 --> 0:9:46,73
