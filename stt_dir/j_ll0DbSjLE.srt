1
0:0:16,879 --> 0:0:23,71
All right, we've got the rope over.


2
0:0:23,71 --> 0:0:24,72
For Tim,


3
0:0:24,72 --> 0:0:28,929
having the ability to be an expert tree climber and taking his


4
0:0:28,929 --> 0:0:33,3
six foot seven frame up into a tree and
sitting in a cramped blind and waiting for


5
0:0:33,3 --> 0:0:36,76
seven or eight hours for a bird to show up 
and get the images,


6
0:0:36,76 --> 0:0:40,81
there are very few people on the planet 
who probably can do that.


7
0:0:40,81 --> 0:0:46,69
A good example of that is the work that we did
on Greater Birds-of-Paradise.


8
0:0:46,69 --> 0:0:50,52
All right, 


9
0:0:50,52 --> 0:0:53,84
here’s the lek right here.


10
0:0:53,84 --> 0:0:58,22
See these branches right here; 
this is the main display perch


11
0:0:58,22 --> 0:1:0,89
and secondary perch there.


12
0:1:0,89 --> 0:1:3,32
And there’s my blind over there


13
0:1:3,32 --> 0:1:4,76
where I’ve been shooting from.


14
0:1:4,76 --> 0:1:7,52
And right here is 


15
0:1:7,52 --> 0:1:11,15
my leaf camera.


16
0:1:11,15 --> 0:1:12,119
So now we had


17
0:1:12,119 --> 0:1:13,13
two ropes


18
0:1:13,13 --> 0:1:18,34
up two different trees and the first thing
Tim had to do was climb the tree in the dark,


19
0:1:18,34 --> 0:1:21,61
get the camera set up,


20
0:1:21,61 --> 0:1:23,2
climb back down,


21
0:1:23,2 --> 0:1:24,58
go over to the other tree,


22
0:1:24,58 --> 0:1:30,26
climb that tree, get in, set up his big camera,
set up the laptop, plug everything in and basically


23
0:1:30,26 --> 0:1:33,95
pray that it all was going to work because there
wasn’t any more opportunity to climb back down


24
0:1:33,95 --> 0:1:36,34
and fix it if it didn’t work
because the sun was coming up


25
0:1:36,34 --> 0:1:41,99
and the birds were coming.


26
0:1:41,99 --> 0:1:46,58
Ever since the beginning of the Birds-of-Paradise project 
I've been sort of dreaming of a shot


27
0:1:46,58 --> 0:1:48,85
where I could see a bird in the foreground


28
0:1:48,85 --> 0:1:52,56
and be looking out over the rain forest 
in the background.


29
0:1:52,56 --> 0:3:52,56
And I saw the shot download to my
laptop and I said, “That’s it”.
I just knew I had it.
