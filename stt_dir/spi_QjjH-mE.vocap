###1 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Hi, I`m Carl Azuz. And this is CNN STUDENT NEWS. Ten minutes,
###4 no commercials, headlines from around the world coming straight to your classroom. It
###8 all starts right now.
###16 Two weeks after the so called Super Storm Sandy hit the North Eastern U.S., there are
###27 some signs of recovery in the region. Power has been restored for millions of people,
###32 some bridges and tunnels have reopened. But signs of devastation and struggle are there
###37 too. Officials say the storm is responsible for at least 113 death in the U.S., more than
###42 160,000 people still don`t have power. That means they are fighting the cold as the temperature
###47 drops. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano says the priority is to get food, shelter
###53 and clothing to these victims of the storm. Some of that is coming from relief groups
###57 and volunteers like this team from New Orleans that cooked and served thousands of meals.

###72 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is this legit? Saudi Arabia is the world`s largest producer of
###78 oil?
###79 It`s true. The Middle Eastern nation is home to around one fifth of the entire world`s
###85 existing reserves of oil.
###88 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###90 AZUZ: But Saudi Arabia might lose that number one ranking by the end of this decade. A new
###96 report says the U.S. will be the world`s top producer of oil by the year 2020. The U.S.
###101 is going through a sort of oil boom right now, and part of that is thanks to new technology.
###106 For example, hydraulic fracturing, which is sometimes called fracking. It`s a process
###110 that involves pumping water and chemicals into the ground to cause rock formations to
###114 fracture and release oil and natural gas. It`s controversial, though. Some researchers
###120 are worried that the process could hurt the environment. That same concern, producing
###124 oil versus protecting the environment is happening up in the Arctic, where some companies are
###129 planning to drill. Miguel Marquez has more on that.
###131 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###132 MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is the spot where America`s oil needs meets environmental
###136 frustration and concern.
###138 The Noble Discoverer, one of two rigs Shell is operating in the Arctic, the rigs aren`t
###143 drilling for oil, only putting in 1500 foot preparatory wells that they`ll revisit and
###148 complete next year when the real work begins.
###151 Success here doesn`t come easy. In a setback, Shell scaled back its drilling plants this
###155 summer after a major piece of cleanup gear and oil containment dome was damaged during
###161 testing. To win drilling right, Shell has paid for and equipped its own armada of cleanup
###166 vessels. Environmentalists and some Alaskan native say, the failure is proof the Arctic
###171 is not ready for oil exploration.
###173 (on camera): You can`t have success in a controlled environment, how can you be confident you
###177 can control it in the place like the Arctic?
###179 PETE SLALBY, VICE PRESIDENT, SHELL ALASKA: Well, first of all, we are working on this,
###181 this is why we were testing the containment dome to begin with. We were looking at a really,
###186 say, it is a serial number one piece of equipment. So the work we are doing is really working
###192 to work all the bugs out of the problems before we bring it up to the Arctic.
###196 MARQUEZ (voice over): But oil from the Arctic won`t come cheap and it won`t come easily.
###200 Shell has already spent $5 billion just to get to this point, and they are not entirely
###205 sure what they`ll find down there. They believe that as much as 20 percent of America`s future
###211 oil needs could be below the sea floor where I`m standing.

###215 AZUZ: The U.S. Navy is hoping to send a message. It punished seven of its elite Special Forces
###221 members, its Navy SEALs for releasing classified information. Now, normally, this kind of punishment
###226 would be handled privately. But not this time around. The U.S. Navy made this punishment
###231 public, because commanders wanted to let all SEALs know that this kind of behavior is unacceptable.
###237 Brian Todd now tells us what this is all about.
###239 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###239 BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You are in their eyes, as they sprint through dangerous
###243 terrain, dodge explosions, gun down their enemies.
###247 The new video game "Medal of Honor: Warfighter" from Electronic Arts brags that it gives you
###253 the experience of fighting with SEAL Team Six. It`s given seven real members of that
###257 team the experience of losing half their pay for two months and likely their careers. At
###263 least one of those SEALs was on the raid that killed Osama bin Laden last year. A Navy official
###267 says the seven, all active duty, have been reprimanded for giving up classified information
###272 to the makers of the game when they worked as paid consultants.
###275 (on camera): Why do you think they gave up?
###277 JOHN MCGUIRE, FORMER NAVY SEAL: I wasn`t part of the game, but making the game, but I heard
###281 that they might have shown their equipment that they used, and for some people that might
###284 not seem like a big deal, but you put a little piece of information here, together with another
###288 piece of information there and you can get some information to put people in harms` way.
###292 TODD: John McGuire is a former Navy SEAL who served ten years. He says one big problem
###296 with what these SEALs did was that it was not authorized by their commanders, but the
###300 problems go beyond that.
###302 This episode adds more controversy over SEALs capitalizing on their reputation. John McGuire`s
###307 got an outdoor fitness business based on his experience. He had to clear the name of that
###312 business 14 years ago with the Navy. There was a recent movie, "Act of Valor" featuring
###316 real active duty Navy SEALs, that was cleared by the Pentagon. But there was also a book
###321 written by a former SEAL who was on the bin Laden raid. The Pentagon complained about
###326 that for revealing secret information.
###327 HARRY HUMPHRIES, FORMER NAVY SEAL: It`s gotten out of hand. There is entirely too much being
###331 discussed about a community that lives on the fact that it`s a group of folks that thrive
###339 on a concept called silent pride.
###342 TODD: The SEALs lives are secret, their identities classified. Still, one former SEAL disputes
###348 the notion that the video game gave much away. He says raids of militants compounds have
###353 not suggested they use video games for intel.

###357 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes out to Ms. Litkenhus`s students at John F.
###362 Kennedy Middle School in Plainfield, Illinois.
###365 The festival of Diwali is observed by which of these religions? Here we go, is it Taoism,
###372 Hinduism, Shintoism or Baha`I? You`ve got three seconds, go!
###381 Diwali is a festival of lights in Hinduism, the world`s third largest religion. That`s
###389 your answer and that`s your Shoutout.
###393 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###396 AZUZ: Diwali is one of the most important festivals in Hinduism, it`s happening right
###401 now, starts today and lasts for five days. The word Diwali means "row of lights," and
###406 that`s what you`ll see a lot of during this celebration. Everything from small lamps to
###410 lights to giant fireworks displays. For Hindus, the Diwali festival represents the victory
###416 of light over darkness, good over evil. It also marks the start of a New Year, and it`s
###421 a time when many Hindus exchange gifts and offer prayers for a successful year. ` All
###426 right. Our next report today is from Sara Hoye. It`s about a program for teenagers in
###430 Philadelphia that`s called "Cradle to Grave." It takes place at a hospital, and the people
###435 who designed the program hope that by bringing these teens there as visitors, they can teach
###439 them about the dangers of gun violence and prevent them from returning to the hospital
###444 as patients.
###444 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###445 SCOTT CHARLES, CRADLE TO GRAVE Welcome. I work with gunshot patients. How many of you
###448 guys know somebody who`s been shot?
###449 SARA HOYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Philadelphia educator Scott Charles is on a mission to
###453 save young lives. Charles and Amy Goldberg, chief trauma surgeon at Temple University
###458 Hospital, co-founded the Cradle to Grave program to help reduce gun violence in the city of
###462 brotherly love.
###463 CHARLES: What we are going to do today is kind of take you behind the scenes, pull back
###466 the curtain and let you see what we do ...
###467 HOYE: The Cradle to Grave program brings local high school students inside Temple`s trauma
###471 center to relive the final 15 minutes of life of a teen killed by gun violence.
###476 CHARLES: That young boy stood over Lamont (ph) and fired ten more shots into him.
###482 AMY GOLDBERG, CRADLE TO GRAVE: You know gun violence can kill. But I think it`s really
###489 our responsibility to prevent these kids from coming in.
###492 HOYE: Among America`s largest cities, Philadelphia`s homicide rate is the worst. With African Americans
###498 making up 85 percent of the victims.
###500 CHARLES: You know, statistics suggest that as a young black man, you have a greater chance
###504 of being shot and killed in Philadelphia than you would have if you were a soldier serving
###509 in the conflicts in Afghanistan or Iraq. That`s absurd to me.
###514 HOYE: Since 2006, more than 7,000 students have come to the Cradle to Grave program.
###518 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Like I don`t want that to happen to me. Like I want to be able to
###522 live, be someone my mom wants me to be.
###525 GOLDBERG: We want to really teach them the preciousness of life. That in an instant your
###530 life can be changed forever.
###532 HOYE: Change they want for the better.
###535 Sara Hoye, CNN, Philadelphia.

###538 AZUZ: Thanksgiving is next week. And this year, we`d like to know what you are thankful
###543 for. You can comment on our blog and if you are at least 13 years old, you can tell us
###547 in person through an I-report. Now, on the I-reports, no music, just you and the camera,
###552 this is your chance to get on CNN STUDENT NEWS. Visit us at cnnstudentnews.com.
###556 Today`s before we go segment is either incredibly cute or incredibly creepy. Actually, it might
###562 be a little bit of both. This is a slow loris, and this is how a slow loris eats a rice ball.
###568 It takes the rice ball slowly. It considers the rice ball slowly. It nibbles the rice
###574 ball slowly. Well, at least it lives up to its name. For the record, it`s holding a fork,
###579 but eating with its hand. So, no table manners. You might think loris is a made up name, but
###584 that`s why we show you videos like this, so you know what the truth is and what the lore
###588 is.
###588 That`s going to wrap things up for us today. For CNN STUDENT NEWS, I`m Carl Azuz.
