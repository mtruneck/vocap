###10 J.F. MUSIAL: Welcome to Angelholm, Sweden, about an
###12 hour north of Copenhagen, and like most European cities,
###15 it's beautiful, both the scenery and the people.
###18 
###38 Sweden has had a great legacy of innovation design and
###41 engineering, especially in aerospace and automotive.
###44 Think of Volvo.
###45 Think of Saab.
###47 But what if you mixed the two, aerospace and automotive?
###49 
###78 CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: I had a lifelong dream to start
###81 my car company and build cars.
###83 It started when I was five years old.
###84 I mean, I got the question, always, why do
###86 you have this dream?
###87 And I couldn't really answer.
###88 I didn't really know.
###90 And then I started thinking.
###90 I said, when I was five years, I saw this Norwegian animated
###95 stop motion movie about a bicycle repairman who built a
###98 fantastic racing car up on a mountaintop in Norway, and
###102 took it to LeMans and won over the establishment.
###104 And I was so fascinated by this movie, I remember, when I
###107 walked out of the movies, that I said to myself, that's what
###110 I want to do when I grow up.
###111 And when you're like five years old, you don't really
###116 think about--
###117 fiction or reality.
###118 It's kind of intertwined.
###120 And you're really impressionable.
###122 So I think that was what was the triggering me to do this
###124 and it's just stuck with me.
###126 I was kind of pre-programmed to do this from that day on.
###128 
###131 When I started the company, I was only 22.
###133 J.F. MUSIAL: Is that so?
###134 CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: So I've always had a keen
###138 interest for engineering, technical things and worked
###142 with cars and mopeds and boats and electronical things.
###145 But I never really started it officially.
###150 So we have, of course, a bunch of engineers here that are
###152 trained engineers, but I'm kind of more like an inventor
###157 or something like that.
###158 
###162 So this is our development room for all the carbon fiber
###166 parts that we use in our cars, so we have all the technology,
###170 all the carbon fiber technology
###171 proprietary to our company.
###174 We started developing carbon fiber parts back in 1996 for
###178 the first time.
###179 So we have quite a vast experience of special
###182 manufacturing carbon fiber parts for cars.
###185 What you can see here is the material that is the visible
###193 part of the carbon.
###194 It's kind of a twill weave.
###198 And there are different types of carbon fiber.
###200 There are uni-directional, different weaves, different
###203 directions depending on the need, the
###205 stiffness, the strength.
###207 We always want to optimize to keep the weight down and the
###209 costs down of the carbon fiber and to make the car as light
###212 as possible.
###213 So the tools, I would say are either made out of--
###216 the tools are large.
###217 They're made out of carbon fiber to make them not too
###220 cumbersome and heavy to deal with.
###222 And they have exactly the same heat expansion as the part
###225 itself, so there needs to be no
###226 compensation for thermal expansion.
###229 But smaller parts we machine most of the time straight out
###233 of a billet aluminum.
###236 So here, for example, we have a lamp clusters.
###239 We have turbo tubing.
###241 Here we have a tool for intake plenum.
###249 So, then we have a lot of turbo tubes made up here.
###254 So what you're seeing here is a vacuum bagging
###255 process, where we--
###258 we only use the most extreme type of carbon fiber material
###261 which is called the pre-preg from Advanced Composite Group
###263 in England.
###264 And it's the same material you make--
###266 well again, fighter jets or Indy cars, or F1 cars out of.
###270 
###294 In our carbon fiber monocoque, we actually have aluminum
###299 honeycomb inside.
###301 And this is very unusual for a road car.
###304 I think, well, let's say most Formula One carbon tops, they
###310 use aluminum honeycomb.
###312 The advantage of aluminum honeycomb, compared to other
###315 types of core structures or other types of honeycomb
###317 materials, is that it's very crash absorbent and it holds
###321 the pieces together very well in an accident situation.
###325 But the negative side is it's very expensive to work with
###328 and takes a long time to implement.
###330 And as far as I'm aware, we're the only road car manufacturer
###335 with a carbon fiber monocoque that actually use aluminum
###339 honeycomb in the monocoque.
###340 So it makes it basically safer, extremely strong.
###345 But it takes more time and more cost.
###347 But I think, in a car like this, that's acceptable.
###351 If you look at these two pieces, they almost have the
###355 same stiffness, but this has the core inside.
###358 And this is just solid carbon.
###361 So it saves a lot of weight.
###363 You maintain the stiffness, but of course, you reduce some
###367 of this strength due to that it's less carbon.
###371 But still, it's massively stronger than anything else of
###373 the same size, shape and weight.
###377 So what we're seeing here is what we call Station 2.
###383 By this time, we've made all the carbon fiber bits and
###386 pieces and received them from our suppliers.
###389 And then we put them on this fixture and pre-fit everything
###392 prior to paint, and make sure everything aligns perfectly.
###396 And if there are any specific customer demands to the body
###399 work, we adjust it here and custom fabricate parts, if
###405 there's a need for that.
###406 And then we take it all apart and send it to the paint shop.
###411 J.F. MUSIAL: Is everything painted here?
###412 CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: Everything is painted here.
###414 I jokingly say that when people ask how much can you
###418 customize, and I say, well, if you pay us enough, we can
###421 build you a helicopter.
###423 J.F. MUSIAL: So I must ask.
###425 How old are you?
###426 ROBERT BERWANSKI: I'm 24.
###427 J.F. MUSIAL: 24 years old and you're the test driver for
###429 Koenigsegg.
###432 You must love it.
###433 ROBERT BERWANSKI: I love it.
###434 I seriously do.
###435 J.F. MUSIAL: So this is my first time in a Koenigsegg.
###436 Let's see how it does.
###438 ROBERT BERWANSKI: Yeah, I can show you how it runs.
###439 That's the interesting bit.
###441 J.F. MUSIAL: Let's see how it goes.
###441 And I love the fact that you have your own private runway
###446 to do whatever you want.
###446 ROBERT BERWANSKI: We need that.
###449 J.F. MUSIAL: So what do we [INAUDIBLE]?
###450 That's 100 kilometers an hour, right there.
###451 In seventh gear, so it's a seven-speed gear box.
###455 ROBERT BERWANSKI: And now we're on 1,600 revs.
###457 J.F. MUSIAL: Got it.
###457 ROBERT BERWANSKI: So actually, on the highway, it's quite
###459 economic for the car it is.
###462 But you don't usually do that.
###464 Here you have 1,200 horsepower.
###465 
###471 CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: So then we take the parts into
###472 our paint department.
###474 You can actually see them spraying it.
###477 J.F. MUSIAL: And is any color possible?
###479 CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: Any color is pretty
###479 much possible, yes.
###480 We have our own mixing room.
###482 We, actually, even come up with our own paint mixtures.
###485 We're very proud of our paint result because we put a lot of
###491 effort into it.
###492 Let's say that the thickness of the clear coat is about
###495 three, four times that of a normal production car.
###498 That adds a little bit of weight, but it also means you
###501 get a fantastic gloss and the ability to polish for a long
###506 time and polish out scratches and stuff like that.
###509 And you get this very deep sensation when
###512 you look at the car.
###514 And there's a lot of specialist polishing companies
###517 around the world that work with all these hypercars and
###520 many of them tell us that they really like to work on our
###523 cars because they're really the top.
###525 
###532 What I noted was that people close the door like this and
###534 then they want to walk away.
###536 They didn't want to push it down and then push it in.
###538 Because a 2-step motion is not natural.
###542 J.F. MUSIAL: Especially for a door.
###543 CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: You're not used to that.
###544 People are used to slamming the door and going.
###546 And here you have to push it down and then push it in.
###548 So I said, there must be a way that can
###551 be done in one motion.
###553 And that's when I came up with this idea that it's actually
###557 not a 2-step process.
###559 And most people, at the time, thought that's impossible
###561 because how can you slide in and down at the same time
###565 without hitting and getting the rubber seals
###566 to seal and so on.
###568 And that's where we have to really engineer the whole
###570 entry of the car to the movement of the hinge, and the
###574 movement of the hinge to the entry of the car.
###577 A properly engineered part, when you look
###579 at it, looks natural.
###580 But to get the complex function looking simple and
###584 natural, that's really difficult.
###586 So we spent thousands of hours developing this hinge.
###589 And it's not only the hinge, it's how it's combined with
###592 the whole car.
###593 It's the shape of the door.
###594 It's the angle of the door seals.
###596 It's how the door seals look.
###597 It's how it interacts with the roof, how the door interacts
###600 with the roof, how it interacts with the
###602 body, when it's open.
###603 So it's kind of a parallelogram here, and then
###606 you have the helical cut gears here, hydraulic damper.
###610 The door mounts to this portion here, so when I push
###613 this in, you can see what it does.
###614 
###621 ROBERT BERWANSKI: I'll give it a slow start because the gear
###623 box isn't finished.
###626 Are you ready?
###628 J.F. MUSIAL: Let's go.
###629 
###644 Oh God.
###645 
###647 That was incredible.
###649 Oh, my God.
###652 That was incredible.
###654 ROBERT BERWANSKI: So that was 300, and this engine nor gear
###657 box isn't fine tuned yet.
###660 So it will go better and it will shift
###663 faster when it's done.
###664 J.F. MUSIAL: That's the fastest I've ever been
###666 [INAUDIBLE].
###667 Right there.
###668 CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: So this is, basically, a normal
###670 chassis dyno, but what's pretty cool about it is that
###673 we have the engine management hooked up
###676 to this whole system.
###677 So with remote keyboard, when you sit in the car, you can
###680 actually program the engine and see what it's doing.
###683 And on these screens, we can get the power and torque and
###685 everything.
###685 We can take up to about 1,500 horsepower on
###690 these hydraulic brakes.
###692 And we use it for tuning cars, for different types of fuel
###696 for different markets.
###697 For example, we had a customer in Brazil who wanted to run on
###700 E100 instead of E85.
###702 So we made a flex fuel for E100.
###704 And then, in certain areas, they have
###706 better or worse fuels.
###707 We kind of buy in the local fuel, make sure the car runs
###711 good on it.
###712 J.F. MUSIAL: Do you actually bring the fuel in?
###713 CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: We do, yes.
###714 And then, of course, we have our own airfield which is
###718 very, very convenient.
###719 J.F. MUSIAL: For any super car manufacturer, you
###720 just need that air.
###722 CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: Yeah, I think, without that we
###725 could not do what we're doing.
###726 Because we can any--
###727 24/7, we can go out high speed testing and really push things
###731 to the limit, so it's really, really convenient.
###734 
###741 In the engine system, we actually have a few
###745 interesting patents.
###747 We're working very much with the new type of valve
###749 technology.
###750 It's not implemented in production, but
###752 it's for the future.
###754 So we have like 12 patents within the company, within the
###757 Koenigsegg group.
###759 And then we have turbo patents, a new type of
###765 variable turbo that very much reduced back pressure when
###770 connected to catalytic converters, and let's say,
###775 well, puts the spool up point at lower RPM, and
###779 gives better response.
###780 So if we go around to the other side here, you can see
###784 this little R thing here.
###787 That's actually a flex fuel sensor.
###789 So depending on what fuel the driver puts in the tank, it
###794 comes in here and it's sensed and then the whole engine
###796 management is reprogrammed, depending on what's entering
###802 into the engine.
###804 So the whole fuel management system is geared to handle
###810 massive amounts of fuel.
###812 Alcohol has less energy density, so let's say that if
###816 you only would run on petrol, the pumps, injectors,
###819 everything, is sized for over 2,000 horsepower.
###822 But when you run on an alcohol, it's a good safety
###825 margin, but we can get around 1,200.
###828 We didn't realize it until recently, but this is actually
###831 the most downsized engine in the world of any production
###834 car engine.
###836 
###838 When you think of it, it's a five liter engine and we have
###841 almost 1,200 horsepower.
###844 So you have like 228 horsepower per
###849 liter engine volume.
###850 That's 33% percent higher than any other
###853 production car in the world.
###857 There are 214 Newton meters of torque per liter, which I
###861 don't know exactly what it equates to in foot-pounds.
###864 We have six horsepower per kilo engine weight, which is
###868 100% more horsepower per kilo than the nearest other
###872 production car engine.
###874 
###901 J.F. MUSIAL: That's incredible how it's so
###901 steady at that speed.
###903 Oh, my God.
###904 CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: That was 315.
###907 And you don't need to hold the steering wheel when you brake
###909 either because it's so stable and it's so high.
###913 This is station four, here.
###914 SPEAKER 1: Four, okay.
###915 CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: Yes.
###915 So here the monocoque comes clear coated in the areas
###919 needed from the paint job.
###921 And we fit a lot of wiring harnesses, electrical systems,
###926 dry sump tank, oil cooler, air conditioning condenser.
###933 This is kind of interesting.
###934 We have a lithium iron, not ion, iron battery because it's
###939 safer, instead of normal lead based batteries.
###943 So it basically has half the size and a
###946 third of the weight.
###947 And we put it very centrally in the car, even though it
###950 doesn't weigh that much anymore.
###952 It's the center part of the car, to try to keep the mass
###955 in the center as much as possible.
###957 This is also why the fuel tanks are actually inside the
###960 carbon monocoque.
###962 So the fuel tanks are in here, the back, and there.
###965 And it's only one piece, like a big horseshoe tank.
###968 J.F. MUSIAL: Oh, so they're all--
###969 That's good to know.
###969 They're all physically connected.
###971 CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: No, you only fill
###972 it up from one point.
###972 It's one huge tank, like that.
###974 And this is, as far as we can see, the absolutely best
###977 position for a fuel tank because it's, again, central.
###981 Most of it is extremely low down and it's definitely the
###985 most safe area of the car.
###986 It's protected by the monocoque
###988 being inside the monocoque.
###990 And that makes it very complex.
###992 It's like, almost, a airplane fuel tank, if you consider
###996 them being in the wings.
###997 Even though we don't have a roof helping out as a
###1001 stiffening structure, as far as we are aware, we have the
###1004 stiffest carbon monocoque, whether it has a roof or not.
###1008 Because it actually has 65,000 Newton meters per degree's
###1012 difference.
###1013 And if you look at how massive these sections are, it becomes
###1016 understandable.
###1018 Of course, if you would put a fixed roof in it, it would be
###1021 even better, but it's still extremely high.
###1024 Inside there, we have the honeycomb.
###1026 And then you have this massive section of 21 layers of carbon
###1029 fiber, uni-directional in the correct direction.
###1031 So it just becomes extremely stiff and strong.
###1035 And the weight of the chassis is under 70 kilos, including
###1038 fuel tanks.
###1041 And this is also pretty extreme.
###1043 
###1046 The windshield area and the roll bar,
###1049 it's all carbon fiber.
###1050 There aren't really any metal parts.
###1053 Of course, power means heat.
###1056 And a large portion of our market is in the hot climate
###1059 like the Middle East, and so on.
###1061 And we heard many horror stories about even famous
###1064 brands, big car manufacturers having
###1066 issues in those regions.
###1068 Our first customers came from that region and they said,
###1070 whatever you do, put as big of a water radiator that you can.
###1075 And we told them, well, OK, we would calculate it.
###1076 We need a certain size and we'll test it.
###1078 And they said, forget about that.
###1080 Put the biggest you can.
###1081 Everyone can [INAUDIBLE].
###1082 That doesn't mean anything.
###1084 Just put a huge one in.
###1085 So we managed to extend it this much from our
###1088 calculations.
###1088 We never ever had any issues.
###1091 Even parts like this that look standard are actually
###1093 specially manufactured to control
###1095 airflow out of the car.
###1096 This is just a water bottle, but it's our own.
###1101 J.F. MUSIAL: Very cool, thank you, Robert.
###1103 ROBERT BERWANSKI: You're welcome.
###1103 I could show you some [INAUDIBLE] as well.
###1106 J.F. MUSIAL: Sure, why not?
###1107 
###1137 ROBERT BERWANSKI: That was 220.
###1138 J.F. MUSIAL: 220 sideways.
###1165 You are insane.
###1168 You have the best job in the entire g-d world.
###1171 Robert, you really are--
###1173 at 24 years old, you are one of the luckiest people to ever
###1176 face this earth.
###1178 ROBERT BERWANSKI: I know.
###1179 J.F. MUSIAL: You're very lucky.
###1180 Thank you so much, Robert.
###1182 ROBERT BERWANSKI: You're welcome.
###1184 J.F. MUSIAL: That was such a pleasure.
###1184 I've never been a car that is that fast at
###1186 spin and in the turns.
###1188 It's incredible.
###1189 CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: The gear box is partially
###1191 developed by ourselves.
###1193 It's manufactured by a company in Italy, called Sima, and
###1197 we've developed our own electronic differential.
###1201 On the side, you can see this black cover.
###1203 So we can actually adapt the differential locking
###1206 depending, from our own issues, depending on setting
###1211 of the driver and driver behavior and track and so on.
###1215 And then, we have here, it's not mounted right now, but in
###1218 here and it sits hydraulic clutch.
###1222 We call this the first single input shaft
###1225 dual clutch gear box.
###1227 When we shift, at the same time as we open the clutch
###1231 here, we have this hydraulic clutch sitting on the same
###1234 shaft, which works in the opposite direction.
###1236 It actually cloaks us against the casing to slow down the
###1240 input shaft so that we can push the synchros much harder
###1243 because it's already pre-synchronized.
###1246 So it basically takes out 2/3 of the synchronization time.
###1250 So it's not that it's zero shifting time,
###1253 but it's close to.
###1255 And it's so close that you hardly can notice it anymore.
###1258 J.F. MUSIAL: I always thought it was very cool, this little
###1261 gauge on the side.
###1261 CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: Right, yes, yes.
###1263 This is, of course, also completely custom.
###1266 J.F. MUSIAL: So whose idea was this?
###1267 CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: That was my idea because we needed
###1270 a custom expansion bottle and it's pretty much hidden.
###1277 And normally these are made in plastic, but it didn't really
###1279 make sense.
###1279 We used to have one in plastic earlier on, but you would have
###1282 to look from the back and you couldn't see it.
###1284 And we wanted to fabricate the one that was really more
###1286 optimized to the shape of the car
###1288 And then I came up with--
###1290 you can actually see the level through a tube
###1293 with a glass on it.
###1295 And here, you can see also a triplex suspension which is
###1299 one of my ideas I had.
###1302 And the reason for it, basically, is that the more
###1305 power we got--
###1306 Well, OK, in the engine room you saw the wishbones.
###1311 And we decided early on not to have anti-squat geometry
###1316 because we have very stiff springs.
###1318 The car was light and it didn't squat very much and we
###1322 want a little bit of squat for traction.
###1325 But as the power increased over the years, the car
###1329 started squatting a bit more and more, and to a degree, we
###1332 felt it was a little bit too much with the
###1333 latest power level.
###1335 So instead of building in an anti-squat geometry into the
###1338 suspension, which has downsides, it actually upsets
###1341 other parts of the suspension.
###1343 I came up with this idea that we put in an anti-squat damper
###1346 instead, which we call the triplex suspension.
###1348 So when it squat, it actually pushes from both sides, and it
###1351 means double the speed compared to the
###1353 normal shock absorber.
###1355 So it calms down the squat, but it doesn't, in cornering,
###1361 do anything.
###1361 You just go sideways.
###1363 Unless you hit something with one wheel, it starts doing it
###1366 a little bit.
###1366 So it's about fine tune.
###1367 It's kind of a new dimension, another dimension of shock
###1370 absorbing compared to just having two separate ones.
###1373 It adds a little bit of weight but it controls the squat and
###1379 it maintains a very clean, true suspension geometry.
###1384 You can only drive really fast if you feel safe and it's easy
###1387 to control.
###1389 So you can see how very calm it is with
###1392 this enormous power.
###1394 It's totally controlled.
###1396 When we did this world record in braking and acceleration,
###1398 you can do that record, basically, with a finger on
###1400 the steering wheel, full break from 300.
###1404 It doesn't do anything like this.
###1405 It's just track solid, yeah.
###1407 
###1419 ROBERT BERWANSKI: I got it.
###1421 
###1429 CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: This is also our own product.
###1431 We even go in and engineer all the switch gears and
###1434 everything inside these paddles because it needs to
###1436 have the right feel.
###1438 I want kind of a trigger feel.
###1442 You can't go halfway.
###1444 It's either you've pushed it or you haven't, so it's a very
###1447 clear, distinctive feel to it.
###1450 And then, underneath this leather, it's actually a foam
###1455 core to make a soft grip.
###1457 And underneath that, it's a hollow carbon structure made
###1459 in one piece.
###1460 This is what we call alignment PDI test driving.
###1465 Actually this station goes all the way over there because
###1467 that's the washing area.
###1468 We have wheel alignment, corner waiting and then a test
###1473 track outdoors.
###1474 Here we take care of our test cars, our prototypes.
###1478 We have four service mechanics in here and they also service
###1483 customer cars, for example, where we have customers where
###1486 we have no dealers, we either fly these guys out there to
###1489 service the car or they fly their car here to
###1493 service their car.
###1494 But usually when they take the car here, they
###1496 also upgrade them.
###1497 We have upgrade programs for the CCA test, the CCR, the
###1502 CCX, the CCXR.
###1503 Basically, you can upgrade a CCX to a CCXR.
###1506 And a gear 2 and a gear R, a CCA test to CCR
###1511 engine, if you like.
###1512 And there is some cross, even though there's big differences
###1516 between a CCR and a CCX, it's actually a completely new
###1518 chassis and completely new body, and a completely new
###1521 electronic system.
###1522 They look similar but are different.
###1523 But some systems can be adopted backwards, so we keep
###1527 the earlier cars really fresh and alive and modern by
###1530 implementing the latest technology we have for them.
###1533 And as it's being done here at the factory, it's not
###1536 bastardizing them.
###1537 It's actually original equipment, but it's making
###1540 them stay alive and fresh.
###1543 We started producing cars in 2002 and now, it's 2012, when
###1548 we'll build over 100 cars this year.
###1550 But in 2002, we built three cars.
###1553 In 2003, we built five cars.
###1556 In 2004, it was seven, eight.
###1559 So it's, of course, grown over the years, but on an
###1561 average, around 12.
###1563 J.F. MUSIAL: So in this year, how many do you
###1564 think you will produce?
###1565 CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: Hopefully, a little bit more.
###1567 Yeah.
###1568 You saw the steering wheel down there and we first
###1571 designed it to print out, feel it.
###1573 And then I had some ideas about this shape, so I
###1577 reshaped this by hand.
###1578 And then we have a laser scanner, so we scan that back
###1581 in, get into the computer, and then print out another one and
###1584 test it again until we're satisfied.
###1587 So we can go from 3D CAD to physical model, modify it by
###1592 hand, putting it back in 3D CAD with a hand modifications,
###1595 re-engineering it, and then out again.
###1597 And then OK, a couple of iterations
###1599 and then we're done.
###1599 So it's really nice to touch and feel and see in reality.
###1603 It really changes everything.
###1604 If you only do it on the screen you will never end up
###1608 exactly how you want it in the end.
###1609 You have to have this fast, simple process of going from
###1613 virtual reality into reality and then back again.
###1616 I found a fantastic factory, 10 minutes away from here,
###1619 which was kind of a rebuilt old farmhouse with the marble
###1623 floors and thatched roof and it was like
###1625 20,000 square feet.
###1626 It was perfect, and we started there.
###1630 However, in 2003, we had a fire, so the building got
###1633 pretty much destroyed.
###1635 We managed to save most of the equipment and the parts while
###1639 it was in the fire.
###1640 We just got everything out.
###1642 And then this was still a military area, so the mayor
###1647 came to the site.
###1648 It was a Saturday, and we were all suited up and said, well,
###1652 we managed to get most of it out, but now we don't have a
###1654 building anymore.
###1655 And he said, I'll talk to some people at the military base.
###1658 So we actually got into one of the buildings, next door here,
###1660 that was already cleared out because they
###1662 were shutting down.
###1663 And that, ironically, was the fire station, used to be the
###1666 fire station.
###1668 And we first planned to rebuild our first factory
###1670 because we really liked it.
###1672 But when we got all the plans for it and how long it would
###1675 take, it would take one to one half year to get it done.
###1678 We would have to set up temporarily here.
###1680 And we did that at the first site.
###1682 And we realized, if we're going to make this work, and
###1685 start producing cars and then move again, we're never going
###1686 to get it going.
###1687 And then we had a look here.
###1689 There were still airplanes in here, and he said, maybe this
###1692 could be something for you.
###1694 It's not a quaint and elegant place we used to have, which
###1698 we really liked, but it's practical.
###1701 And of course, people think, well, then you got access to
###1703 the test track, which is not true, because we already had
###1707 access to the test track.
###1708 Actually the gate to the test track is closer to where our
###1710 old factory was than where this is.
###1713 So that had nothing to do with it because it was just next
###1716 door anyway.
###1717 But it's practical.
###1719 It's nice.
###1719 It has the heritage of the airplanes.
###1721 So we've got the ghost.
###1722 When we moved in here, we got the ghost.
###1724 J.F. MUSIAL: That was going to be my final question.
###1726 What is the ghost?
###1726 CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: Yeah, that ghost was on that
###1728 wall when we came in here, and you see these lines, here on
###1731 the floor, it's where they taxied in the airplanes.
###1734 And that's actually the symbol for this squadron that used to
###1737 be here, which was the oldest airplane squadron or fighter
###1741 squadron in Sweden, from the '30s or something.
###1745 And they were called the ghost because before, they had a
###1747 kind of modern aviation electronics and so on.
###1752 They just flew on their senses and they took off before dawn.
###1759 And people could only hear them and not see them.
###1761 And then they came back after dusk, so they heard these
###1763 airplanes but didn't see them.
###1764 And of course, airplane was quite a new thing then.
###1766 So they were called the Ghost.
###1767 So they have adopted this symbol.
###1769 And for some reason, very early on, they adopted the
###1771 slogan, the show must go on.
###1773 And they wrote that on their airplane, in English even.
###1777 Then the show stopped.
###1778 And we came here and some of the people working there with
###1782 airplanes said, please can't you continue our tradition?
###1785 Put our ghost on your card.
###1787 Then the show will go on.
###1789 And we said OK, yes.
###1790 So we said, every car we will build here we will put the
###1792 ghost on to honor the squadron.
###1794 So that's the story.
###1796
