twice yellowstone


15
0:1:1,549 --> 0:1:3,13
selected


16
0:1:3,13 --> 0:1:4,71
how did it for


17
0:1:4,71 --> 0:1:9,52
and why he in the heart of the rock


18
0:1:9,52 --> 0:1:14,3
scientists studying yellowstone are
uncovering the violent past


19
0:1:14,3 --> 0:1:15,8
by warts


20
0:1:15,8 --> 0:1:19,7
crushed by simply chance


21
0:1:19,7 --> 0:1:32,9
blasted by the biggest organic eruptions
ever known on the plane


22
0:1:32,9 --> 0:1:33,48
even today


23
0:1:33,48 --> 0:1:47,51
yellowstone's is one of the most
dangerous places on earth


24
0:1:47,51 --> 0:1:51,52
yellowstone national park is one of the
most amazing places on earth


25
0:1:51,52 --> 0:1:55,75
had


26
0:1:55,75 --> 0:1:59,85
saying some of america's most stunning
scenery


27
0:1:59,85 --> 0:2:5,119
wildlife that attracts three million
tourists a year


28
0:2:5,119 --> 0:2:8,549
to understand we're yellowstone came
from


29
0:2:8,549 --> 0:2:10,909
why it is so acted today


30
0:2:10,909 --> 0:2:15,769
we need to take a journey back into the
distant past at the north american cars


31
0:2:15,769 --> 0:2:21,419
deep into the earth's painting


32
0:2:21,419 --> 0:2:23,479
sixty thousand feet up on the road


33
0:2:23,479 --> 0:2:25,639
of mountain plateau

0:2:25,639 --> 0:2:29,419
primarily with in wyoming but stretching
into parts of ohio

39
0:2:39,76 --> 0:2:44,839
fifty four-mile


40
0:2:44,839 --> 0:2:46,9
and it's a long time


41
0:2:46,9 --> 0:2:48,689
most unusual


42
0:2:48,689 --> 0:2:51,989
geological structures


43
0:2:51,989 --> 0:2:54,809
warts and usual doubt partner


44
0:2:54,809 --> 0:2:58,419
are the wildlife unusual


45
0:2:58,419 --> 0:3:1,129
is the wide open space unusual


46
0:3:1,129 --> 0:3:4,219
no you've got it all over the western
u_s_


47
0:3:4,219 --> 0:3:6,409
what's unusual


48
0:3:6,409 --> 0:3:12,389
it's a very unusual geology and created
a partner


49
0:3:12,389 --> 0:3:13,98
yellowstone was fair


50
0:3:13,98 --> 0:3:18,209
hundred as the world's first national
park because of


51
0:3:18,209 --> 0:3:21,259
victory our dream


52
0:3:21,259 --> 0:3:26,779
it's this strange geology that attracts
teams of scientists to the park


53
0:3:26,779 --> 0:3:27,93
their task


54
0:3:27,93 --> 0:3:31,599
to piece together the story of the
incredible processes that build this


55
0:3:31,599 --> 0:3:35,19
unique extraordinary landscape


56
0:3:35,19 --> 0:3:36,5
hiking indeed


57
0:3:36,5 --> 0:3:39,829
into yellowstone's past


58
0:3:39,829 --> 0:3:41,62
geologic history


59
0:3:41,62 --> 0:3:43,39
yellowstone


60
0:3:43,39 --> 0:3:47,649
goes back to the formation of the north
american continent


61
0:3:47,649 --> 0:3:49,919
summarizing it was still


62
0:3:49,919 --> 0:3:51,25
are two point eight


63
0:3:51,25 --> 0:3:58,389
three point two billion your old rock
some of the police in north america


64
0:3:58,389 --> 0:4:2,989
only by traveling back into the past and
we figure out why didn't this particular


65
0:4:2,989 --> 0:4:4,249
location


66
0:4:4,249 --> 0:4:8,649
there are two thousand four hundred
miles of river more than three hundred


67
0:4:8,649 --> 0:4:12,259
waterfall


68
0:4:12,259 --> 0:4:17,39
and the world's greatest concentration
ten thousand hot water springs


69
0:4:17,39 --> 0:4:19,469
development models


70
0:4:19,469 --> 0:4:20,699
yes vents


71
0:4:20,699 --> 0:4:23,41
and guys


72
0:4:23,41 --> 0:4:26,61
what did these features revealed about
this landscape


73
0:4:26,61 --> 0:4:34,539
how it was for


74
0:4:34,539 --> 0:4:36,54
the investigation begins at yellowstone


75
0:4:36,54 --> 0:4:38,149
star traction


76
0:4:38,149 --> 0:4:41,77
old faithful


77
0:4:41,77 --> 0:4:50,85
it's a key clues to what's going on
underneath the surface


78
0:4:50,85 --> 0:4:53,75
located in the southwest of yellowstone
park


79
0:4:53,75 --> 0:4:59,65
geyser puts on an explosive display
every ninety minutes or so


80
0:4:59,65 --> 0:5:8,99
blasting out thousands of gallons
scalding hot


81
0:5:8,99 --> 0:5:12,379
yellowstone is like no other places on
earth there is so mickey coming out here


82
0:5:12,379 --> 0:5:16,479
it's really singular phenomenon


83
0:5:16,479 --> 0:5:18,4
flat fair and i did


84
0:5:18,4 --> 0:5:22,68
will pay for his word back to life there
was an actually napping was recharging


85
0:5:22,68 --> 0:5:26,759
the temperature of the water was
increasing missus was fresh arising


86
0:5:26,759 --> 0:5:31,27
develop it was a rather complex plumbing
systems filled with patrons and conduit


87
0:5:31,27 --> 0:5:34,33
think constrictions


88
0:5:34,33 --> 0:5:38,789
rainwater saturating the ground around
the geysers slowly feels is underground


89
0:5:38,789 --> 0:5:41,56
reservoir


90
0:5:41,56 --> 0:5:47,139
hot rocks below ground heat the water
under pressure for around ninety minutes


91
0:5:47,139 --> 0:5:52,969
suddenly some water spurts through a
tiny five-inch white crack in the wrong


92
0:5:52,969 --> 0:5:57,779
this causes a drop in the pressure
within the water chamber


93
0:5:57,779 --> 0:5:58,969
in an instant


94
0:5:58,969 --> 0:6:8,879
thousands of gallons of water returned
to steve blasted up into the air


95
0:6:8,879 --> 0:6:12,789
under pressure builds up enough steam
bubbles rise to the surface persistent


96
0:6:12,789 --> 0:6:16,3
depressurizing senate collapsed


97
0:6:16,3 --> 0:6:28,61
faithful shows that rocks below the
surface of very hot


98
0:6:28,61 --> 0:6:33,289
scientists find clues to a violent past
thirty four miles southeast of the hot


99
0:6:33,289 --> 0:6:34,539
springs


100
0:6:34,539 --> 0:6:40,949
on the shores of the circular lake
called indian park


101
0:6:40,949 --> 0:6:42,689
telecast


102
0:6:42,689 --> 0:6:45,789
my job is to basically be a rock detect
them


103
0:6:45,789 --> 0:6:50,36
and so i decided to determine what their
origin is and what they history isn't


104
0:6:50,36 --> 0:6:54,79
that particular rock


105
0:6:54,79 --> 0:6:57,12
okay now in this particular case


106
0:6:57,12 --> 0:6:59,69
let's look at this


107
0:6:59,69 --> 0:7:0,21
this track


108
0:7:0,21 --> 0:7:2,81
when it started it was just a loose


109
0:7:2,81 --> 0:7:6,519
saint you can just bring your fingers to
it


110
0:7:6,519 --> 0:7:13,65
the solid boulder is formed from the
millions of individual grains of sand


111
0:7:13,65 --> 0:7:17,939
microscopic analysis reveals the grades
have been cemented together by chemicals


112
0:7:17,939 --> 0:7:22,909
and pressure deep under the ground


113
0:7:22,909 --> 0:7:27,999
how did the rock get to the surface


114
0:7:27,999 --> 0:7:31,989
morgan has chemically david the rocks
discovered in three thousand years ago


115
0:7:31,989 --> 0:7:36,219
the boulder was blasted out of the
ground by the hot water explosion of a


116
0:7:36,219 --> 0:7:39,559
gigantic geysers


117
0:7:39,559 --> 0:7:40,519
u_n_c_


118
0:7:40,519 --> 0:7:42,159
for a little longer


119
0:7:42,159 --> 0:7:44,599
rock fragments


120
0:7:44,599 --> 0:7:46,24
team in terry l


121
0:7:46,24 --> 0:7:49,5
rejected i think i mean


122
0:7:49,5 --> 0:7:50,419
as high as


123
0:7:50,419 --> 0:7:52,689
he took five thousand feet


124
0:7:52,689 --> 0:7:57,169
and their at some point material would
start with


125
0:7:57,169 --> 0:8:0,129
running this explosion column


126
0:8:0,129 --> 0:8:6,9
now you wouldn't wanna be standing next
to one of those


127
0:8:6,9 --> 0:8:7,159
indian park


128
0:8:7,159 --> 0:8:15,719
as the crater that the guys are left
behind


129
0:8:15,719 --> 0:8:19,77
but fifties dwarfed by the crater morgan
has found it may repay


130
0:8:19,77 --> 0:8:24,369
in yellowstone


131
0:8:24,369 --> 0:8:29,59
stated this geyser explosions of
thirteen thousand years ago


132
0:8:29,59 --> 0:8:32,29
so here we are one yellowstone lake


133
0:8:32,29 --> 0:8:37,31
and it says you can see in beautiful day
and flights in plastic


134
0:8:37,31 --> 0:8:41,64
on the floor of yellowstone lake it's
anything but quiet


135
0:8:41,64 --> 0:8:45,92
morgan's research proves that geysers
were exploding around the lake and even


136
0:8:45,92 --> 0:8:52,13
under the water between thirty thousand
and three thousand years ago


137
0:8:52,13 --> 0:8:56,38
fantasizing jess that whatever was power
in numbers


138
0:8:56,38 --> 0:9:0,78
but is it still active today


139
0:9:0,78 --> 0:9:5,54
aclu comes from underwater events at the
bottom of the guys are greater


140
0:9:5,54 --> 0:9:14,16
they talk about vast quantities of hot
water and gases


141
0:9:14,16 --> 0:9:15,66
we


142
0:9:15,66 --> 0:9:18,12
to find out what's creating the gases


143
0:9:18,12 --> 0:9:21,85
gigolo eastern in his assistant collect
samples from the hot springs in the


144
0:9:21,85 --> 0:9:26,2
center of the park


145
0:9:26,2 --> 0:9:29,95
the final they use is designed to
collect up gas bubbles before they reach


146
0:9:29,95 --> 0:9:35,2
the surface so that they're not
contaminated by four to three years


147
0:9:35,2 --> 0:9:40,59
soooooooo


148
0:9:40,59 --> 0:9:44,99
it is a very complex with the gases and
but we have a lot of tools that we can


149
0:9:44,99 --> 0:9:47,69
use to try to unravels rather


150
0:9:47,69 --> 0:9:50,29
complicated information


151
0:9:50,29 --> 0:9:54,4
so will look at all of the gas is the
kind and caring for about the different


152
0:9:54,4 --> 0:9:55,87
kinds of rocks beneath the ocean


153
0:9:55,87 --> 0:10:0,25
and try to understand how things might
be changing from from week to week here


154
0:10:0,25 --> 0:10:1,95
two years


155
0:10:1,95 --> 0:10:4,18
defeat


156
0:10:4,18 --> 0:10:8,66
analysis of the gases reveals that they
are a mix of carbon dioxide sulfur


157
0:10:8,66 --> 0:10:9,72
dioxide


158
0:10:9,72 --> 0:10:11,99
and hydrogen sulfide


159
0:10:11,99 --> 0:10:19,1
it is the same mix that is found coming
out of altadena


160
0:10:19,1 --> 0:10:22,89
but the final clue to what is actually
going on underground is found on the


161
0:10:22,89 --> 0:10:26,9
edge of the same hot springs


162
0:10:26,9 --> 0:10:30,69
sent the request crystals that we've
collected on the site of the pool


163
0:10:30,69 --> 0:10:35,52
all their discusses what remains gets
pasta proposal but one-sided


164
0:10:35,52 --> 0:10:38,88
consultant beautiful little quartz
crystals some of them have a little bit


165
0:10:38,88 --> 0:10:41,0
of iron staining in other things


166
0:10:41,0 --> 0:10:47,33
uh... that most most of the american and
said she was in the olympics here


167
0:10:47,33 --> 0:10:51,25
quartz crystals like being used in a
moment of formed as a hot molten rock


168
0:10:51,25 --> 0:10:52,18
lava flow


169
0:10:52,18 --> 0:10:59,2
slowly cool after being erupted onto the
surface from deep underground so the


170
0:10:59,2 --> 0:11:8,11
crystals a clear evidence that under the
springs is a volcano


171
0:11:8,11 --> 0:11:13,7
yellowstone's hot water features all
going to one conclusion


172
0:11:13,7 --> 0:11:18,1
yellowstone must be power


173
0:11:18,1 --> 0:11:22,93
geysers only erupted the rocks are hot
enough to turn water into steam


174
0:11:22,93 --> 0:11:28,54
gases from underwater have the same
composition as those from volcanoes


175
0:11:28,54 --> 0:11:33,71
ports in the hot springs must have come
from paul ten o'clock


176
0:11:33,71 --> 0:11:37,7
there is an immense amount of energy
coming out of the gramm


177
0:11:37,7 --> 0:11:39,94
the six prayer


178
0:11:39,94 --> 0:11:44,97
the guises the mud pots the hot springs
in the standards where's all that heat


179
0:11:44,97 --> 0:11:49,53
coming from is coming from the molten
rock associated with the yellowstone


180
0:11:49,53 --> 0:11:52,8
volcano


181
0:11:52,8 --> 0:11:53,48
that leaves a big question


182
0:11:53,48 --> 0:11:55,42
unanswered


183
0:11:55,42 --> 0:11:58,4
this gentle rolling landscape


184
0:11:58,4 --> 0:12:12,22
clears the ball


185
0:12:12,22 --> 0:12:14,5
yellowstone's unique volcanic geology


186
0:12:14,5 --> 0:12:18,2
is potentially deadly dangerous


187
0:12:18,2 --> 0:12:22,19
it makes a crucial to monitor what's
happening under the ground


188
0:12:22,19 --> 0:12:26,55
they yellowstone what do you know is a
very very active volcanic system and so


189
0:12:26,55 --> 0:12:27,889
it really


190
0:12:27,889 --> 0:12:30,93
requires observation


191
0:12:30,93 --> 0:12:34,47
everything that we do here has a
research component but it also has a


192
0:12:34,47 --> 0:12:36,5
volcano monitoring component


193
0:12:36,5 --> 0:12:38,63
and that is is


194
0:12:38,63 --> 0:12:42,16
is activity picks up here we're gonna
want to know something about the


195
0:12:42,16 --> 0:12:45,68
plummets dancing


196
0:12:45,68 --> 0:12:49,21
to try and project when yellowstone's
hidden volcano with the roads in the


197
0:12:49,21 --> 0:12:50,53
future


198
0:12:50,53 --> 0:12:55,62
scientists study it's geological past


199
0:12:55,62 --> 0:12:58,89
predatory passed because to look at the
landscape


200
0:12:58,89 --> 0:13:0,49
in reno


201
0:13:0,49 --> 0:13:6,48
the geologic story and there's so many
clues and so much evidence here


202
0:13:6,48 --> 0:13:12,67
yet that it's a fascinating place to
work


203
0:13:12,67 --> 0:13:15,22
scientists began investigating
yellowstone


204
0:13:15,22 --> 0:13:18,71
even before it became the world's first
national park


205
0:13:18,71 --> 0:13:21,33
in eighteen seventy two


206
0:13:21,33 --> 0:13:32,5
but observations of this astonishing
land began long before that


207
0:13:32,5 --> 0:13:36,28
dating aged arrowheads shows that native
americans first lived here eleven


208
0:13:36,28 --> 0:13:40,46
thousand years ago


209
0:13:40,46 --> 0:13:44,4
their legends of yellowstone's angry
spirits who made the ground tremble were


210
0:13:44,4 --> 0:13:50,86
passed on to her early explorers such as
louis and clark


211
0:13:50,86 --> 0:13:55,67
later reports from trappers explorers
and mountain men like john coulter jim


212
0:13:55,67 --> 0:14:1,15
bridger sold of geysers defiance in
defeat into the air and springs so hot


213
0:14:1,15 --> 0:14:6,48
that meet was red lead kolkata


214
0:14:6,48 --> 0:14:11,33
but these with ought to be told tales to
the eighteen sixties when geologist


215
0:14:11,33 --> 0:14:15,73
investigated and found that the lava
flows and high there's which side


216
0:14:15,73 --> 0:14:19,99
so volcanic activity


217
0:14:19,99 --> 0:14:21,95
s


218
0:14:21,95 --> 0:14:23,94
sts


219
0:14:23,94 --> 0:14:25,9
tests


220
0:14:25,9 --> 0:14:28,49
but something really wasn't liked


221
0:14:28,49 --> 0:14:33,87
nobody could actually find the
yellowstone volcano


222
0:14:33,87 --> 0:14:36,56
considerate know as soon as one of the
world


223
0:14:36,56 --> 0:14:38,65
most active volcanoes


224
0:14:38,65 --> 0:14:40,83
people come out here visitors other son


225
0:14:40,83 --> 0:14:44,16
interest-sensitive what do you mean
oh... i don't see it


226
0:14:44,16 --> 0:14:49,93
smoking volcano i don't see it


227
0:14:49,93 --> 0:14:51,4
crater


228
0:14:51,4 --> 0:14:55,92
all the things that one normally thinks
of for an active volcano


229
0:14:55,92 --> 0:14:58,98
so without obvious signs of a volcano


230
0:14:58,98 --> 0:15:3,91
scientists wanted for other things


231
0:15:3,91 --> 0:15:5,0
they would find them


232
0:15:5,0 --> 0:15:9,23
in the sweeping forests of launch cold
calling


233
0:15:9,23 --> 0:15:12,84
these are the only plans to thrive on
the poor soil that comes from a


234
0:15:12,84 --> 0:15:20,36
particular type of lava called right
away


235
0:15:20,36 --> 0:15:24,61
yellowstone's constant plagues of
mosquitoes also revealed the presence of


236
0:15:24,61 --> 0:15:29,66
that same right life lol


237
0:15:29,66 --> 0:15:30,81
then i lighter


238
0:15:30,81 --> 0:15:35,38
are you not very firmly involved


239
0:15:35,38 --> 0:15:40,7
makes those long ponds and water that
member info away


240
0:15:40,7 --> 0:15:44,17
knows her wonderful breeding grounds


241
0:15:44,17 --> 0:15:45,33
with students


242
0:15:45,33 --> 0:15:49,63
are a lot of status if you can see and
flying around my head


243
0:15:49,63 --> 0:15:53,4
so the pine trees in the insects both
indicates that there's a lot of right


244
0:15:53,4 --> 0:15:58,33
like in yellowstone


245
0:15:58,33 --> 0:16:4,84
because while i'd love a creates
incredibly violent volcanic eruptions


246
0:16:4,84 --> 0:16:10,6
that's much more like a bread dough it's
about a thousand two million times


247
0:16:10,6 --> 0:16:13,64
thicker are more viscous we put a bunch
of gases


248
0:16:13,64 --> 0:16:17,44
we can have a very explosive eruptions


249
0:16:17,44 --> 0:16:20,68
but if the rial i'd love it that
explosive


250
0:16:20,68 --> 0:16:36,12
how big a bang did it for today


251
0:16:36,12 --> 0:16:40,86
to find that out scientist looks not
inside yellowstone park


252
0:16:40,86 --> 0:16:48,82
within a faraway river valley meadow
creek wyoming


253
0:16:48,82 --> 0:16:52,75
cutting down through the land over
millions of years the river has exposed


254
0:16:52,75 --> 0:16:59,9
and unusual thin layer of plaque rocking
in the cliff face


255
0:16:59,9 --> 0:17:10,85
nearby road cutting leads investigators
examined the mysterious dark rod


256
0:17:10,85 --> 0:17:13,88
if you look at this airport indicate
what close


257
0:17:13,88 --> 0:17:16,22
you can see that the here's a promise
fragment


258
0:17:16,22 --> 0:17:17,679
these these


259
0:17:17,679 --> 0:17:21,3
restaurants here fragments


260
0:17:21,3 --> 0:17:24,73
and to pat if we were to make it this
section of this rock i look at it under


261
0:17:24,73 --> 0:17:26,3
the microscope


262
0:17:26,3 --> 0:17:28,459
you in fact seat compressed


263
0:17:28,459 --> 0:17:31,5
uh... glass shards


264
0:17:31,5 --> 0:17:34,419
the black later the geologists call them
sitting


265
0:17:34,419 --> 0:17:38,5
is actually a type of glass


266
0:17:38,5 --> 0:17:45,82
it's crucial evidence that the rocks and
soil here came out of a volcano


267
0:17:45,82 --> 0:17:50,42
because of sitting in his support
boiling hot passion gas rapidly cool


268
0:17:50,42 --> 0:17:55,43
under great pressure


269
0:17:55,43 --> 0:17:56,85
and that's just what happened


270
0:17:56,85 --> 0:17:58,56
when hot mechanical out


271
0:17:58,56 --> 0:18:2,15
rollout across the land


272
0:18:2,15 --> 0:18:5,51
deals in the importance of the very
bottom layer


273
0:18:5,51 --> 0:18:12,98
from below and crushed by the way to pop
the agreeing on the top


274
0:18:12,98 --> 0:18:16,309
national air the crash the city in the
head of free still


275
0:18:16,309 --> 0:18:19,179
visible today


276
0:18:19,179 --> 0:18:21,37
its base is characterized by this very


277
0:18:21,37 --> 0:18:26,6
that dancin sitting in a citizen blow
came to rest and was compacted


278
0:18:26,6 --> 0:18:30,94
and then above this dance glass layer is
their grades upwards into a tam sort of


279
0:18:30,94 --> 0:18:34,55
region and continues up for about an
additional thirty feet and then up on


280
0:18:34,55 --> 0:18:35,89
top of that


281
0:18:35,89 --> 0:18:40,45
is expose today marshall has formed and
we can see growing up there three sets


282
0:18:40,45 --> 0:18:45,45
of education trees and grasses and
things of that sort


283
0:18:45,45 --> 0:18:49,26
study in the middle composition of the
proved that it came from an ancient


284
0:18:49,26 --> 0:18:54,54
volcanic blast in yellowstone park


285
0:18:54,54 --> 0:18:58,56
and there's only one way did so much
that she could have been blasted so very


286
0:18:58,56 --> 0:18:59,38
far away


287
0:18:59,38 --> 0:19:1,86
from its own


288
0:19:1,86 --> 0:19:8,299
eruption must have been larger far
larger than anything ever seen by man


289
0:19:8,299 --> 0:19:9,88
so big


290
0:19:9,88 --> 0:19:14,96
scientists now label it as a super
eruption


291
0:19:14,96 --> 0:19:19,1
we're looking at the statistics deposit
from a super optioned and yet where over


292
0:19:19,1 --> 0:19:24,77
fifty miles source of the will be
eruption


293
0:19:24,77 --> 0:19:29,43
geologists of recreated what must happen
here on the day the p_l_o_ so that's


294
0:19:29,43 --> 0:19:31,83
good


295
0:19:31,83 --> 0:19:37,98
can destined avalanches of ash raced out
of the park in all directions


296
0:19:37,98 --> 0:19:41,99
services traveling at very high velocity
uh... easily over


297
0:19:41,99 --> 0:19:45,4
hundred miles per hour crossed one
sentence


298
0:19:45,4 --> 0:19:50,23
and february everything in its path is
extremely hot movie right


299
0:19:50,23 --> 0:19:54,23
and perhaps is not a specific united
degrees fahrenheit


300
0:19:54,23 --> 0:19:58,15
sewage wastes a pizza oven and it's just
very hot


301
0:19:58,15 --> 0:20:1,73
someone would it have been like to be
standing on this five hundreds of


302
0:20:1,73 --> 0:20:4,46
thousands of years ago


303
0:20:4,46 --> 0:20:9,79
the date when the yellowstone ash cloud
roared over the horizon


304
0:20:9,79 --> 0:20:13,24
that the impact of this would would be
in absolutely


305
0:20:13,24 --> 0:20:16,75
unimaginable you would be i think you
would be dissecting culated


306
0:20:16,75 --> 0:20:21,13
there and and and unrecognizable and it
would be very difficult to find any of


307
0:20:21,13 --> 0:20:25,62
you


308
0:20:25,62 --> 0:20:29,39
all of the evidence about the size of
the super eruption help solve the


309
0:20:29,39 --> 0:20:32,87
mystery of the missing volcano


310
0:20:32,87 --> 0:20:36,679
scientists realized that the super
iraq's and was so enormous


311
0:20:36,679 --> 0:20:45,47
but it must have blown the volcano to
pieces


312
0:20:45,47 --> 0:20:46,72
swarms of mosquitoes


313
0:20:46,72 --> 0:20:51,15
show that explosive rial i'd love a
underlies parts of the park


314
0:20:51,15 --> 0:20:56,19
subsidy in the last sixty miles away
reveals that nashville spread from miles


315
0:20:56,19 --> 0:20:58,98
around yellowstone


316
0:20:58,98 --> 0:21:0,24
thick layers of debris


317
0:21:0,24 --> 0:21:6,37
confirm how gigantic an explosion this
must have been


318
0:21:6,37 --> 0:21:11,65
problem now is the explosive legacy
physical volcano left behind


319
0:21:11,65 --> 0:21:14,97
deadly dangerous to listen


320
0:21:14,97 --> 0:21:24,5
deep onto the ground


321
0:21:24,5 --> 0:21:28,64
for nearly a century after yellowstone
national park was established nobody


322
0:21:28,64 --> 0:21:29,83
realized one


323
0:21:29,83 --> 0:21:33,54
astonishing fat


324
0:21:33,54 --> 0:21:34,52
at the park


325
0:21:34,52 --> 0:21:41,64
is located inside one of the biggest
volcano creators on her


326
0:21:41,64 --> 0:21:45,38
it wasn't until the late nineteen
sixties that american geophysicist


327
0:21:45,38 --> 0:21:49,809
robert christians realized that rock
formations he had been studying for


328
0:21:49,809 --> 0:21:53,19
several years all around the edges of
the park


329
0:21:53,19 --> 0:21:59,2
in fact formed a giant circular free


330
0:21:59,2 --> 0:22:2,99
he compared his findings on the ground
with a series of nasa pictures taken


331
0:22:2,99 --> 0:22:5,8
between nineteen sixty six


332
0:22:5,8 --> 0:22:7,92
in nineteen seventy


333
0:22:7,92 --> 0:22:8,99
confirming


334
0:22:8,99 --> 0:22:12,23
that the rain was the reason of a giant
crater


335
0:22:12,23 --> 0:22:17,14
forty-five miles across


336
0:22:17,14 --> 0:22:21,15
parts of the crater reimburse still
clearly visible today


337
0:22:21,15 --> 0:22:21,81
but the other


338
0:22:21,81 --> 0:22:30,21
edge is almost out of sight


339
0:22:30,21 --> 0:22:33,92
finding the crater coincided with
another scientific discovery in a


340
0:22:33,92 --> 0:22:39,25
totally different part of the country


341
0:22:39,25 --> 0:22:44,28
in california scientists identified a
strange then later in any buried


342
0:22:44,28 --> 0:22:47,75
underneath the modern days only


343
0:22:47,75 --> 0:22:52,32
dash matched material from the
yellowstone crater


344
0:22:52,32 --> 0:22:56,69
dating the soil layers proved that the
ash arrive six hundred forty thousand


345
0:22:56,69 --> 0:22:58,63
years ago


346
0:22:58,63 --> 0:23:8,21
scientists at last had a date
yellowstone super


347
0:23:8,21 --> 0:23:15,2
gash was later found all over the
western u_s_ confirming the huge size of


348
0:23:15,2 --> 0:23:18,63
the eruption


349
0:23:18,63 --> 0:23:22,46
at least eighty times the size of the
eighteen eighty three explosions that


350
0:23:22,46 --> 0:23:34,3
destroyed the island crack itself


351
0:23:34,3 --> 0:23:36,84
and twenty five hundred times bigger


352
0:23:36,84 --> 0:23:44,3
nineteen eighty arrests of mount saint
helens


353
0:23:44,3 --> 0:23:48,37
the almost unimaginable sides of the
yellowstone last means but scientists


354
0:23:48,37 --> 0:23:49,82
now with all that


355
0:23:49,82 --> 0:23:57,7
a super lonely


356
0:23:57,7 --> 0:23:59,99
but that creates another mystery


357
0:23:59,99 --> 0:24:2,22
this peaceful landscape


358
0:24:2,22 --> 0:24:8,54
weird is the steaming hot crater that
the volcano must have left behind


359
0:24:8,54 --> 0:24:11,84
aim when you're looking at a press
toward instant also


360
0:24:11,84 --> 0:24:14,12
rolling hills and entry


361
0:24:14,12 --> 0:24:18,77
so obviously there's not a big hole left
in the ground uh... from the reaction of


362
0:24:18,77 --> 0:24:23,59
the above the elston volcano so
something else has happened


363
0:24:23,59 --> 0:24:27,54
one of the first processes was
instilling with all sorts of volcanic


364
0:24:27,54 --> 0:24:28,95
lava flows


365
0:24:28,95 --> 0:24:33,58
entity that's just down from the
landscape for dust recency one of their


366
0:24:33,58 --> 0:24:35,53
all this blah blah flows that


367
0:24:35,53 --> 0:24:40,6
happened after the sixteen forty
thousand your option


368
0:24:40,6 --> 0:24:44,82
over hundreds of thousands of years this
flow has weathered insists oreo been


369
0:24:44,82 --> 0:24:49,63
covered with stream


370
0:24:49,63 --> 0:24:53,72
minnows we're in the born or a different
type of love and it wasn't


371
0:24:53,72 --> 0:24:58,429
still bare of vegetation because this
love of was still a rough up until about


372
0:24:58,429 --> 0:25:2,6
one hundred thousand years ago and


373
0:25:2,6 --> 0:25:10,16
later love of was far less explosive and
more running cooled slowly


374
0:25:10,16 --> 0:25:22,54
this move the harsh mohammed landscape
into yellowstone softer countryside


375
0:25:22,54 --> 0:25:23,83
that made


376
0:25:23,83 --> 0:25:29,26
when it first more tranquil


377
0:25:29,26 --> 0:25:33,79
but there's evidence here that the land
was soon varied once again


378
0:25:33,79 --> 0:25:36,64
this time by freezing snow and ice


379
0:25:36,64 --> 0:25:38,62
the perot


380
0:25:38,62 --> 0:25:43,94
the ice that polish the rocks has a
story to tell


381
0:25:43,94 --> 0:25:47,84
it offers crucial evidence about
volcanic forces still shaking the park


382
0:25:47,84 --> 0:25:53,34
to this day


383
0:25:53,34 --> 0:25:58,9
its tail unfolds through the tiniest of
clues


384
0:25:58,9 --> 0:26:4,49
scratches on the rocks reveal which way
the ice was moving


385
0:26:4,49 --> 0:26:8,3
they show that lisa is always sleep the
same way


386
0:26:8,3 --> 0:26:14,76
outwards and downwards from the vice
captain of the heart of the farm


387
0:26:14,76 --> 0:26:18,9
the only conclusion is that something
pushed up yellowstone park


388
0:26:18,9 --> 0:26:35,71
so much higher than the surrounding
hills the glaciers formed on the top


389
0:26:35,71 --> 0:26:40,62
but what force could possibly powerful
enough to have raised yellowstone speaks


390
0:26:40,62 --> 0:26:52,51
off into the air


391
0:26:52,51 --> 0:26:55,74
the first clues to help answer that
question comes from yellowstone's


392
0:26:55,74 --> 0:26:58,809
numerous persuades


393
0:26:58,809 --> 0:27:0,38
whenever on the forms


394
0:27:0,38 --> 0:27:3,87
the creaks and groans like astronomer
this violent but the creaks and groans


395
0:27:3,87 --> 0:27:6,26
and since the earthquakes


396
0:27:6,26 --> 0:27:12,2
the quakes are recorded by sized
monitors all over the phone


397
0:27:12,2 --> 0:27:15,679
the earthquake monitoring is a critical
part of the trip because it's basically


398
0:27:15,679 --> 0:27:18,549
it's the stethoscope that we have to


399
0:27:18,549 --> 0:27:20,63
really see incense


400
0:27:20,63 --> 0:27:28,96
the the heartbeat of the system


401
0:27:28,96 --> 0:27:35,93
smith is investigating possibly
geological mystery


402
0:27:35,93 --> 0:27:39,83
yellowstone has up to five thousand
earthquake cv


403
0:27:39,83 --> 0:27:41,75
even though it's in the stable heart


404
0:27:41,75 --> 0:27:45,51
the north american continent


405
0:27:45,51 --> 0:27:49,56
scientists needed to know what was
happening underground to shake the park


406
0:27:49,56 --> 0:27:52,98
so my


407
0:27:52,98 --> 0:27:54,3
to find out


408
0:27:54,3 --> 0:28:4,58
they plotted the precise locations and
deaths of earthquakes under the ground


409
0:28:4,58 --> 0:28:11,6
so why are there so many quakes


410
0:28:11,6 --> 0:28:15,38
the answer had to wait until the
mid-nineteen eighties whenever more


411
0:28:15,38 --> 0:28:18,89
powerful computers first let's scientist
c


412
0:28:18,89 --> 0:28:21,57
engineer


413
0:28:21,57 --> 0:28:25,559
seismic waves burning out from
earthquakes travel rapidly through cold


414
0:28:25,559 --> 0:28:26,5
wrong


415
0:28:26,5 --> 0:28:27,53
but slow down


416
0:28:27,53 --> 0:28:29,97
the rocks are hot


417
0:28:29,97 --> 0:28:33,39
the burying wave speeds can be
translated by confusing


418
0:28:33,39 --> 0:28:38,8
two color three d images revealing
exactly where on-ramp rising to the


419
0:28:38,8 --> 0:28:39,55
ground


420
0:28:39,55 --> 0:28:42,15
seismic waves propagate through the
years


421
0:28:42,15 --> 0:28:44,55
just like x_-rays go through a body


422
0:28:44,55 --> 0:28:46,48
so we use the same physics


423
0:28:46,48 --> 0:28:48,8
to reconstruct


424
0:28:48,8 --> 0:28:52,88
the structure of the general of the of
the earth beneath this seismic waves of


425
0:28:52,88 --> 0:28:55,62
outlined the parks underground
structures


426
0:28:55,62 --> 0:29:0,73
revealing a graphic history what's
happened upon the yellowstone


427
0:29:0,73 --> 0:29:4,45
they've revealed this gigantic reservoir
of molten


428
0:29:4,45 --> 0:29:9,9
rock which created yellowstone's crater
landlocked erupted out


429
0:29:9,9 --> 0:29:15,18
the ground above collapsed into the
space left behind


430
0:29:15,18 --> 0:29:18,95
and seismic waves still slow down under
yellowstone today


431
0:29:18,95 --> 0:29:21,7
showing that the magma chambers still


432
0:29:21,7 --> 0:29:23,29
lurks under the park


433
0:29:23,29 --> 0:29:29,62
it's more than thirty miles long twenty
five miles wide ten miles in death


434
0:29:29,62 --> 0:29:34,58
criticizing alters here two years since
bill for campaigns with sending liquid


435
0:29:34,58 --> 0:29:35,53
rock managing


436
0:29:35,53 --> 0:29:38,98
credible fifteen hundred degrees parents


437
0:29:38,98 --> 0:29:43,6
this is the hidden feeding park
yellowstone park


438
0:29:43,6 --> 0:29:45,98
moves give form to the ground above


439
0:29:45,98 --> 0:29:50,7
explaining the fault lines in the
earthquakes the


440
0:29:50,7 --> 0:29:54,47
and its heat ultimately powers all of
yellowstone's hot water food


441
0:29:54,47 --> 0:30:2,34
print guys


442
0:30:2,34 --> 0:30:6,4
subterranean yellowstone is getting a
bit secrets


443
0:30:6,4 --> 0:30:11,14
seismographs reports thousands of
earthquakes in the park


444
0:30:11,14 --> 0:30:15,67
the evidence earthquake waves reveals a
massive mac machine


445
0:30:15,67 --> 0:30:19,35
under yellowstone sir


446
0:30:19,35 --> 0:30:23,65
yellowstone investigation is far from
finished


447
0:30:23,65 --> 0:30:25,9
because they're scared


448
0:30:25,9 --> 0:30:28,49
another even more monstrous size
structure


449
0:30:28,49 --> 0:30:39,21
under the park


450
0:30:39,21 --> 0:30:42,94
by the beginning of the twenty first
century scientists investigating how


451
0:30:42,94 --> 0:30:49,4
yellowstone was made had images of what
lay under the party


452
0:30:49,4 --> 0:30:51,45
there was a problem


453
0:30:51,45 --> 0:30:56,7
technology only allowed a view of a few
miles below the surface


454
0:30:56,7 --> 0:31:1,27
then as more and more data was heading
to more and more powerful computers


455
0:31:1,27 --> 0:31:4,52
there was a breakthrough


456
0:31:4,52 --> 0:31:9,88
in april two thousand six geologist
publishing diagrams amman structures


457
0:31:9,88 --> 0:31:14,22
quarantined under the form


458
0:31:14,22 --> 0:31:16,72
more detailed pictures


459
0:31:16,72 --> 0:31:21,58
resolves restoring


460
0:31:21,58 --> 0:31:25,8
investigators all over the last time
sleeping monster


461
0:31:25,8 --> 0:31:31,82
realized below millissa


462
0:31:31,82 --> 0:31:35,409
snaking down hundreds of miles into the
earth


463
0:31:35,409 --> 0:31:39,9
far deeper into the relatively shallow
magma chamber


464
0:31:39,9 --> 0:31:40,15
is a colossal


465
0:31:40,15 --> 0:31:46,79
volcanic playing


466
0:31:46,79 --> 0:31:47,7
really sorry


467
0:31:47,7 --> 0:31:49,51
howdy bingo


468
0:31:49,51 --> 0:31:53,34
but they can picture it down to four
hundred miles or more


469
0:31:53,34 --> 0:32:1,85
twice the distance between washington
and new york


470
0:32:1,85 --> 0:32:7,51
smith makes an educated guess about what
the underground plume is like


471
0:32:7,51 --> 0:32:10,789
our best estimates doesn't start doing
the physics and i


472
0:32:10,789 --> 0:32:16,35
and to these things if such a conduit of
melted rock what the chimney


473
0:32:16,35 --> 0:32:18,88
that should be called a hot spot


474
0:32:18,88 --> 0:32:22,89
pumped up enough heat to build the rocks
of the crust and feel the overlying


475
0:32:22,89 --> 0:32:24,73
magma chamber


476
0:32:24,73 --> 0:32:26,549
which then erupted


477
0:32:26,549 --> 0:32:29,45
blast out yellowstone's last crater


478
0:32:29,45 --> 0:32:34,64
the malval


479
0:32:34,64 --> 0:32:36,64
understanding of the crater fall


480
0:32:36,64 --> 0:32:42,38
was an important moment for the
investigation


481
0:32:42,38 --> 0:32:47,87
because there was evidence similar
russians that happened before many times


482
0:32:47,87 --> 0:33:0,5
before


483
0:33:0,5 --> 0:33:4,53
throughout the nineteen sixties various
teams of geologist studied the snake


484
0:33:4,53 --> 0:33:5,42
river plane


485
0:33:5,42 --> 0:33:7,9
to the southwest of yellowstone park


486
0:33:7,9 --> 0:33:13,1
and found traces of ancient volcanic
craters


487
0:33:13,1 --> 0:33:15,58
the crater rims had long been eroded


488
0:33:15,58 --> 0:33:23,2
their outlines were confirmed by aerial
pictures over the following decade


489
0:33:23,2 --> 0:33:26,47
there and in a straight line along the
plane


490
0:33:26,47 --> 0:33:29,57
heading for the hearts yellowstone park


491
0:33:29,57 --> 0:33:35,39
on average each crater was a couple of
million years boulder than its neighbors


492
0:33:35,39 --> 0:33:39,11
investigators realize that these are the
remnants of earlier super volcano


493
0:33:39,11 --> 0:33:41,35
explosions


494
0:33:41,35 --> 0:33:44,39
unbroken chain stretching far back


495
0:33:44,39 --> 0:33:51,53
to geological history


496
0:33:51,53 --> 0:33:54,1
it seemed clear time after time


497
0:33:54,1 --> 0:33:59,559
the hot spot that last bit of a civil
rights and


498
0:33:59,559 --> 0:34:1,4
hot spot appeared to have traveled


499
0:34:1,4 --> 0:34:6,52
things of mine


500
0:34:6,52 --> 0:34:9,29
os yet another meeting


501
0:34:9,29 --> 0:34:10,709
how could a hot spots


502
0:34:10,709 --> 0:34:18,549
anchored to the core of the planet


503
0:34:18,549 --> 0:34:23,199
okay


504
0:34:23,199 --> 0:34:26,669
an important clue had been found in
nineteen eighty-five by american


505
0:34:26,669 --> 0:34:33,639
volcanologists williams gosh he realized
that plotting the location of thirty


506
0:34:33,639 --> 0:34:40,449
thousand earthquakes around yellowstone
produced an amazing patterns


507
0:34:40,449 --> 0:34:47,219
the quake's traced out a giant the ship
on the surface of the year


508
0:34:47,219 --> 0:34:51,859
the vichy wrapped around the hot spots
location


509
0:34:51,859 --> 0:34:56,49
it seemed at first to confirm that the
hot spot was still moving


510
0:34:56,49 --> 0:34:59,869
dribbling of the land around it with all
the lines and tens of thousands of


511
0:34:59,869 --> 0:35:7,809
earthquakes


512
0:35:7,809 --> 0:35:11,849
but the real answer is made with the
theory of plate tectonics


513
0:35:11,849 --> 0:35:19,649
it showed that is the american continent
not the hot spots that's moving


514
0:35:19,649 --> 0:35:23,139
and the chain of craters on the snake
river plane is there because for


515
0:35:23,139 --> 0:35:24,969
millions of years


516
0:35:24,969 --> 0:35:26,979
the moving american continent


517
0:35:26,979 --> 0:35:32,559
has continually bush new land over the
stationary hot spots


518
0:35:32,559 --> 0:35:36,309
what is the north american plate with
the forces source of that


519
0:35:36,309 --> 0:35:37,839
that pops troop


520
0:35:37,839 --> 0:35:38,779
loaded


521
0:35:38,779 --> 0:35:41,539
and creates the hot spot track


522
0:35:41,539 --> 0:35:46,449
assisted you're playing the also just
the active proponent of a


523
0:35:46,449 --> 0:35:53,569
repeated hot spot explosions on the land
of make yellowstone


524
0:35:53,569 --> 0:35:57,9
other hot spots have been identified
around the world


525
0:35:57,9 --> 0:36:2,29
like the one that has created the island
chain olwein


526
0:36:2,29 --> 0:36:5,369
only played for a hot spot has erupted


527
0:36:5,369 --> 0:36:10,529
accounts


528
0:36:10,529 --> 0:36:12,869
earlier explosions knew the original
mountain


529
0:36:12,869 --> 0:36:15,759
histories


530
0:36:15,759 --> 0:36:19,639
dandelions smoothed over with later
flows of more running amok


531
0:36:19,639 --> 0:36:29,349
that was released from deep into the
earth's crust


532
0:36:29,349 --> 0:36:34,339
multiple strands of evidence combine to
reveal yellowstone slumbering monster


533
0:36:34,339 --> 0:36:36,329
gigantic hot spot


534
0:36:36,329 --> 0:36:39,379
lying under the fall


535
0:36:39,379 --> 0:36:43,479
quake maps show the hot spots location


536
0:36:43,479 --> 0:36:49,179
seismic waves revealed the depth of the
flu


537
0:36:49,179 --> 0:36:52,139
earlier craters proof regular super
eruptions


538
0:36:52,139 --> 0:36:54,989
for millions of years


539
0:36:54,989 --> 0:36:56,799
all of which leads to the most


540
0:36:56,799 --> 0:36:59,399
question of law


541
0:36:59,399 --> 0:37:14,679
we'll yellowstone iraq's again


542
0:37:14,679 --> 0:37:17,989
measuring the amount of geographical
spread a bashful from yellowstone


543
0:37:17,989 --> 0:37:24,369
superdrive produced some terrifying
thing


544
0:37:24,369 --> 0:37:26,78
six hundred forty thousand years ago


545
0:37:26,78 --> 0:37:32,759
eruption poured out around two hundred
forty cubic miles of material


546
0:37:32,759 --> 0:37:38,91
enough to bury the home of new york
state tens of the d inaction


547
0:37:38,91 --> 0:37:40,309
if it happens again


548
0:37:40,309 --> 0:37:42,29
thousands will die


549
0:37:42,29 --> 0:37:47,399
vast areas of the united states will be
buried involved can a degree


550
0:37:47,399 --> 0:37:55,689
but when we get low stone erupt again


551
0:37:55,689 --> 0:37:58,3
loops and when that next eruption will
happen


552
0:37:58,3 --> 0:38:3,989
comes from investigating the eruptions
of the past


553
0:38:3,989 --> 0:38:7,89
the hot spot punches out a super
eruption on average every six hundred


554
0:38:7,89 --> 0:38:12,639
thousand here


555
0:38:12,639 --> 0:38:13,659
six hundred


556
0:38:13,659 --> 0:38:18,39
and forty thousand years ago


557
0:38:18,39 --> 0:38:21,719
but geologists expect that there will be
warning signs before yellowstone


558
0:38:21,719 --> 0:38:26,679
explodes again


559
0:38:26,679 --> 0:38:33,44
volcanic eruptions are usually preceded
by an increasing number of her


560
0:38:33,44 --> 0:38:37,319
quakes are assigned underground volcanic
chambers are filling


561
0:38:37,319 --> 0:38:39,24
molten rock an expanding


562
0:38:39,24 --> 0:38:40,479
stretch than before


563
0:38:40,479 --> 0:38:51,809
land ball


564
0:38:51,809 --> 0:38:55,939
yellowstone park usually experiences an
average of twelve tiny earthquake


565
0:38:55,939 --> 0:38:58,649
tremors everyday


566
0:38:58,649 --> 0:39:2,459
most urgent week to be felt like
tourists and register only on the most


567
0:39:2,459 --> 0:39:6,29
sensitive sized monitors


568
0:39:6,29 --> 0:39:8,9
but in early two thousand on


569
0:39:8,9 --> 0:39:12,639
more than four times as many quake
started striking everyday


570
0:39:12,639 --> 0:39:16,589
over one ten day period there were more
than five hundred points


571
0:39:16,589 --> 0:39:19,359
some of the month of magnitude three
point nine


572
0:39:19,359 --> 0:39:24,839
powerful enough to frighten the visitors
and with the scientists on alert


573
0:39:24,839 --> 0:39:30,819
there's a second indicator of increasing
paul canning activity


574
0:39:30,819 --> 0:39:31,89
molten rock


575
0:39:31,89 --> 0:39:35,149
does inflating underground chamber


576
0:39:35,149 --> 0:39:36,669
ground above


577
0:39:36,669 --> 0:39:42,159
will rise


578
0:39:42,159 --> 0:39:47,969
seems to be happening right now


579
0:39:47,969 --> 0:39:52,49
unusual evidence to prove it comes from
an unlikely source


580
0:39:52,49 --> 0:39:56,419
the waters of yellowstone lake


581
0:39:56,419 --> 0:40:0,889
around one hundred years ago small steen
ships carried tourists on sightseeing


582
0:40:0,889 --> 0:40:2,769
trips across the lake


583
0:40:2,769 --> 0:40:6,749
but one of the ship's caught fire and
saying forever below the surface of the


584
0:40:6,749 --> 0:40:9,279
lake


585
0:40:9,279 --> 0:40:13,449
but now yellowstone's astonishing
geological forces have resurrected the


586
0:40:13,449 --> 0:40:17,539
ship's remains from their watery grave


587
0:40:17,539 --> 0:40:21,399
here we have absolved run down to a
wider level


588
0:40:21,399 --> 0:40:27,919
and so this al says something about the
defamation and yellowstone


589
0:40:27,919 --> 0:40:32,609
and basically what's happened is that
the uh... floor of the lake has risen


590
0:40:32,609 --> 0:40:36,789
ringing the bell out of water


591
0:40:36,789 --> 0:40:41,469
the reappearance of the rack shows that
land under and around the lake is rising


592
0:40:41,469 --> 0:40:47,189
because of the expansion of the magma
chamber


593
0:40:47,189 --> 0:40:48,609
even more alone


594
0:40:48,609 --> 0:40:53,19
the rate at which it's rising seems to
be increasing


595
0:40:53,19 --> 0:40:54,609
in geological observance


596
0:40:54,609 --> 0:40:58,77
a huge area of yellowstone park is
positively soaring up into the air


597
0:40:58,77 --> 0:41:11,379
faster than it's ever done before


598
0:41:11,379 --> 0:41:15,489
the biggest uplift of all has been
recorded just a few miles from the shore


599
0:41:15,489 --> 0:41:18,89
of the lake


600
0:41:18,89 --> 0:41:20,139
there's a g_p_s_ system here


601
0:41:20,139 --> 0:41:25,99
a much more sophisticated version of the
one in your car in


602
0:41:25,99 --> 0:41:27,669
in measures not only the surface
position


603
0:41:27,669 --> 0:41:29,33
but also its exact altitude


604
0:41:29,33 --> 0:41:33,259
into with infractions of image


605
0:41:33,259 --> 0:41:39,9
there's a small radio intimates here
from sits on top of this still ride


606
0:41:39,9 --> 0:41:42,439
his entered into this route three or
four feet


607
0:41:42,439 --> 0:41:47,579
so if the ground was opened and in turn
was opened


608
0:41:47,579 --> 0:41:53,29
the g_p_s_ and on land on which it's a
good removing upwards


609
0:41:53,29 --> 0:41:54,549
horrible for the


610
0:41:54,549 --> 0:41:56,159
magma chamber


611
0:41:56,159 --> 0:41:59,409
and beginning in late two thousand six


612
0:41:59,409 --> 0:42:1,319
all area ground


613
0:42:1,319 --> 0:42:3,649
started to rise


614
0:42:3,649 --> 0:42:7,19
uh... the order of two to three inches
per year


615
0:42:7,19 --> 0:42:9,329
and as our


616
0:42:9,329 --> 0:42:11,999
sc soul system right here this is an


617
0:42:11,999 --> 0:42:13,609
about that much


618
0:42:13,609 --> 0:42:15,589
and it still moving today


619
0:42:15,589 --> 0:42:19,389
and so we're really seriously pinko
stresses the deformation


620
0:42:19,389 --> 0:42:23,42
the uplift the worst thing at this
station


621
0:42:23,42 --> 0:42:28,299
goes the other thing that yellowstone
superbowl kato is threatening to around


622
0:42:28,299 --> 0:42:30,419
once again


623
0:42:30,419 --> 0:42:33,749
the question what lies in yellowstone


624
0:42:33,749 --> 0:42:36,769
geologic future is fascinating


625
0:42:36,769 --> 0:42:39,659
and uh...


626
0:42:39,659 --> 0:42:44,519
all of my colleagues glow know the
answer to that question


627
0:42:44,519 --> 0:42:50,679
scientists keep a careful watch of the
volcano is active


628
0:42:50,679 --> 0:42:51,789
c_i_d_


629
0:42:51,789 --> 0:42:54,499
sciences to understand the process


630
0:42:54,499 --> 0:42:56,539
and so we have a responsibility


631
0:42:56,539 --> 0:42:59,72
to see how the system is performing and
how it's working


632
0:42:59,72 --> 0:43:3,39
confirmed that they were the store for
us to live of will continue after these


633
0:43:3,39 --> 0:43:8,5
are folks after all it's what made the
system and there was no reason to think


634
0:43:8,5 --> 0:43:12,309
that people who is in stock


635
0:43:12,309 --> 0:43:14,549
yellowstone investigation has shown


636
0:43:14,549 --> 0:43:21,469
at the park sleeping super volcano is
still alive and dangers


637
0:43:21,469 --> 0:43:22,51
underground plumbing


638
0:43:22,51 --> 0:43:25,29
reveals volcanic each


639
0:43:25,29 --> 0:43:28,609
obsidian blast tells of a massive
eruptions


640
0:43:28,609 --> 0:43:32,569
seismographs records thousands of
earthquake


641
0:43:32,569 --> 0:43:37,489
one of the earthquake way revealed
terrifying underground chambers


642
0:43:37,489 --> 0:43:39,949
reappearance some info


643
0:43:39,949 --> 0:43:44,979
at the land is rising


644
0:43:44,979 --> 0:43:50,739
ultimate yellowstone geological
questions remain to be answered


645
0:43:50,739 --> 0:43:52,81
with the super bowl pinoy rock


646
0:43:52,81 --> 0:43:54,729
once again


647
0:43:54,729 --> 0:43:58,299
we know there is enough made me laugh we
know there is enough he we know that


648
0:43:58,299 --> 0:43:59,229
there will be


649
0:43:59,229 --> 0:44:2,119
fieldtrip works in seeking your stuff


650
0:44:2,119 --> 0:44:3,719
we don't know


651
0:44:3,719 --> 0:44:4,989
fissile


652
0:44:4,989 --> 0:44:6,109
e another tennis


653
0:44:6,109 --> 0:44:11,149
straw for corruption


654
0:44:11,149 --> 0:44:12,43
for the investigation


655
0:44:12,43 --> 0:44:15,939
is left with a deadly serious warning


656
0:44:15,939 --> 0:44:19,459
on the time scale the geologists works


657
0:44:19,459 --> 0:44:24,809
coming super eruption in yellowstone may
well be right around the corner


658
0:44:24,809 --> 0:44:26,929
corner could be ten thousand


659
0:44:26,929 --> 0:44:32,909
five hundred thousand years ago


660
0:44:32,909 --> 0:44:34,689
devastating chapter


661
0:44:34,689 --> 0:44:36,44
ever-changing store


662
0:44:36,44 --> 0:46:36,44
how earth was made
