###0 STEVE: So I bet you think this is the part of the show where
###1 I'm going to say, don't try these experiments at home.
###4 And you're right, except there is one experiment
###7 we want you to try.
###8 Just look for the graphic that's right here,
###9 that says, try it.
###10 That's your signal that you can try that
###12 experiment at home.
###13 Everything else off limits.
###15 Look, I've already given you homework and the show hasn't
###17 even started.
###18 
###21 Well, it's Monday and for me that means 9News.
###23 This is the local TV station that I work for and many of
###26 you have maybe seen the segments over the years that
###28 we've done with 9News.
###29 I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to give
###31 you kind of a behind the scenes view of what it looks
###33 like as we prep for one of the segments.
###35 And actually what it looks like from beginning to end.
###38 Today, microwave science.
###41 So this is the best part of getting ready for 9News is
###44 that you get to go to the playroom and actually kind of
###47 work out some of the details.
###48 This is the secret hallway that leads to the playroom.
###50 This is a place that not even--
###51 I mean, our employees don't even know about.
###53 It's secret and this is the--
###55 what the [BLEEP].
###57 Hey!
###58 Hey, get out of here!
###61 We're shooting and--
###62 [CROWD GROANING]
###62 STEVE: Just get out of here.
###65 Go on.
###66 Get out of here.
###67 MALE SPEAKER: Sorry, it fell out and I picked it up.
###70 STEVE: How do you even know about this place?
###72 MALE SPEAKER: I don't know.
###72 I need to get back--
###73 STEVE: Make people get out.
###74 
###77 All right, so the challenge is something fun
###79 to do in the microwave.
###80 
###84 I mean, there's easy things like, for example, there's--
###87 we grab a soap.
###88 So if you take Ivory soap, for example, and you put it in the
###90 microwave, as long as it's fresh Ivory soap--
###94 I do it enough so there's stuff on hand-- as long as
###97 it's fresh Ivory soap.
###99 Ivory soap is the soap that floats, and so we should be
###102 able to put that in the microwave and have it puff up
###104 into these great clouds.
###106 This is a simple thing that people can do,
###107 so we can try that.
###108 There's other things that we can try.
###110 If you use a light bulb, for example.
###113 If you take a regular light bulb and you put a regular
###116 light bulb in the microwave--
###118 well, that would be bad because of the metal, but the
###120 secret is you put it in there with some water.
###123 And the energy from the microwave actually heats up
###126 the tungsten and starts to glow.
###128 So we can try that.
###129 And then, I've been saving these for a long time, so that
###134 you can see this.
###137 Here it is.
###139 OK, I've been saving these for a long time.
###141 Look at this.
###142 Empty chip bags.
###144 So if you take an empty chip bag, made out of this foil
###148 kind of material, stick that in the microwave--
###150 I'll have to look at the notes again-- but you stick that in
###151 the microwave, it will heat it up enough that it will shrink
###154 and you get a little miniature bag out of the deal.
###156 So out of all these things there should be something
###158 today, for the afternoon spot to be able to do.
###162 Let's go find a microwave.
###163 
###166 Here's one of these cool things with these chip bags.
###170 Found this online.
###171 So one of our researchers found it online of people
###174 doing this so don't do this at home.
###176 Find a friend's microwave and do it in
###178 their microwave, right?
###179 So find the plastic chip bags, and use the ones that have
###182 what looks like little foil that's inside.
###185 And again, if you have any concern about ruining your
###187 microwave, then I guess don't do this.
###189 So this goes here like this.
###193 This goes here.
###194 All right, so now you don't want to do this for a long
###197 time, so we're just going to set it for like a minute, but
###200 we're going to turn it off right away.
###201 So this goes in here like this.
###203 And let's do quick minute.
###205 All right, we're ready.
###206 So we're going to turn it off once you see
###208 the sparks come in.
###209 So watch this.
###210 It's going to heat it up.
###213 Bam.
###214 It's really cool.
###215 Watch this.
###216 Bam, look at that.
###218 Look what it does.
###219 Now you have to be very careful, because it's hot.
###221 And there's some cool science behind this.
###223 It's the science of polymers, of course.
###225 When these chip bags are made, they're made out of long
###227 chains of molecules.
###229 So these polymers are stretched out, heated, and
###233 then they're cooled quickly, so it retains this kind of
###236 shape that you have here.
###237 Once we heat it get back up again, which I think you could
###239 do the same thing with just an industrial like heat gun, one
###243 of those things, it would shrink it back down as well.
###246 But here in the microwave, that's
###247 exactly what's happening.
###248 So you're hitting it with a lot of power, it releases it,
###250 and allows those molecules to go back to their original
###253 state, which is a relaxed state, and you've got it.
###255 So it's kind of cool to see the difference there.
###258 It's just a matter now of whether or not this passes the
###260 safety test with my producer.
###262 She might say no to this, of telling people at home to do
###266 this with chip bags.
###268 I think it's OK though.
###269 That's pretty cool went it's been online quite a bit.
###273 All right, here's one that I learned a long, long time ago.
###276 You have to have a glass of water.
###278 Here's the glass of water.
###279 Got it?
###280 And to the glass of water we are going to put a regular
###285 light bulb in the glass of water.
###287 So here's the light bulb.
###289 Got it?
###289 And I know you're not supposed to put things that are metal
###292 in the microwave, so to make it so we don't get that
###295 sparking, we're going to put this down inside like this.
###298 So now, you see how the light bulb is submerged
###301 there in the water?
###302 I think that's exactly what we need.
###304 So now, this whole thing goes into the microwave.
###307 
###310 OK, so now watch the filament insight.
###312 So when we start this, watch the filament inside.
###314 
###318 See how it starts to glow?
###321 It's that awesome?
###323 And there it is.
###324 Here is our light bulb like we had before.
###328 So the energy from the microwave excites that
###331 tungsten filament that we have inside, enough to be able to
###334 give off light.
###335 If you do it for too long, then it cracks and you'll
###338 probably ruin your microwave anyway.
###339 But that's very, very cool to be able to see what it looks
###342 like inside when you stick it in the microwave.
###344 You just have to watch it really, really carefully.
###345 
###350 So cool.
###351 
###354 All right, perfect.
###356 There's two.
###359 This is one of my favorites.
###361 It starts with a mistake that happened years ago, as the
###365 legend goes, that Ivory soap is the soap that floats.
###371 And it's the soap that floats because, supposedly, a long
###374 time ago the person who was manning the whipping device
###377 that made the soap in the factory, left it during a
###381 lunch break, and they came back and the volume was
###384 overflowing and what they'd done is they'd whipped air
###387 into the soap.
###388 And so what they found is when they formed it into the bar--
###391 Ivory is the soap-- here watch this-- it's
###393 the soap that floats.
###395 So Ivory floats.
###397 I guess that's a good thing.
###398 If you're taking a bath, I guess, it floats to the top.
###402 It also is very, very interesting.
###404 Now, if we use those little air pockets that are inside
###407 now, to be able to stick that in the microwave and watch
###409 what happens to the expanding air.
###411 
###414 So watch this.
###418 What I like to do is to break it up into
###419 smaller chunks like this.
###421 So break it up.
###424 That's pretty good.
###425 It just gives it a little bit more surface area.
###427 
###430 OK.
###431 This will make everybody on this floor very happy because
###434 when you cook this, it has this beautiful smell to it
###439 that causes everybody to come out.
###441 Here we go.
###443 
###445 So this goes inside.
###446 You just kind of have to watch the cool things that happen
###448 inside as it's moving around.
###450 Ready?
###451 So watch this.
###452 
###455 So take a look at what happens inside.
###457 As it starts to heat up, those little pockets of air--
###460 of course the molecules move away from each other--
###463 and it starts to expand and you
###464 start to see some movement.
###465 Oh, yeah, take a look.
###469 If you just stick the whole bar inside, it'll work, but I
###472 found that when you break into smaller pieces you get much
###474 better clouds.
###475 
###477 Oh, that's great.
###479 Here, watch this.
###480 Nice.
###481 
###483 Look at that.
###484 These small little pieces produce these
###486 great results here.
###488 So look at the air that's fluffed into it and
###491 pops back out again.
###492 It's hot at this point.
###493 You have to be careful, but this is what
###495 it looks like here.
###497 This is easy to do.
###498 This will be perfect, and we can do it in their microwave,
###501 and there shouldn't be any problem with this at all.
###503 Now it's my job go sell the ideas that work, minus the
###506 grapes, to my producer.
###508 So I'll let her know about the chips and the light bulb, and,
###511 of course, the soap.
###512 And I get the OK, and we write the segment, and we're done.
###515 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###522 All right, it's not as exciting as all three of them,
###528 but I can do it.
###530 All right, the expanding soap is what we're going to do.
###535 OK, see you this afternoon, bye.
###536 
###539 All right, so here's how it works.
###543 Everything is set.
###544 We're about 30 minutes to air.
###547 This is live, so we don't do live-to-tape.
###551 Got everything that you need, hopefully.
###553 Sneak in the building, tell the producer that you're here,
###557 set, and you're ready to go.
###559 Today's different because I just have no idea where
###561 they're shooting.
###563 And you'll notice that we have this just in case the
###564 microwave doesn't work, we can at least show what happens.
###567 TV tricks.
###569 
###572 So this is the control room here at 9News,
###574 and Bob is the director.
###576 And my producer is Jessica, right over there, and she's
###579 the one that told me that I have to do something different
###581 today, so we can't be in the studio.
###582 We have to be some other place.
###584 
###587 This is normally where I bring guests and my
###591 boys and those things.
###592 If they do a good job, look, they get to go to
###594 vending land over here.
###595 So this now is the set for today's segment.
###598 So I'm assuming that we're using a microwave here and
###601 we're just going to stay in here and do the spot this way.
###604 So it's definitely impromptu from what we normally do.
###607 I think it will be fine.
###609 NEWSCASTER: You're not miked so this is us.
###610 STEVE: No, so this is us.
###612 I'll use both hands, so I'll grab this, and I, at the end,
###616 will hold this for you.
###617 The reveal is over there, if I ask you to grab it.
###619 NEWSCASTER: Oh, cool.
###621 All right.
###623 Steve's very cool science experiment today is another
###625 one of those in which he warns you, do not do this at your
###628 home, do this at a friend's home.
###631 STEVE: Because you're in the kitchen, right?
###632 Why do you want to mess up your microwave.
###633 NEWSCASTER: That's right, exactly.
###634 STEVE: That's exactly right.
###635 Do you smell that smell?
###636 NEWSCASTER: I do.
###636 STEVE: It's not eggs, it's not, no, it's Ivory soap.
###639 NEWSCASTER: Oh, it's soap.
###639 STEVE: So this is it.
###640 So you're going to need Ivory soap.
###642 NEWSCASTER: What a cool-- that was a cool science experiment.
###644 STEVE: Isn't it kind of fun?
###645 Kind of fun.
###645 NEWSCASTER: Once again, at a friend's
###646 house, not your house.
###648 All right, Science Guy.
###649 All this information available at stevespanglerscience.com on
###652 the On-Air tab.
###653 STEVE: Got it.
###653 NEWSCASTER: Look for Spangler Science.
###655 OK, it's 4 o'clock, and 9News continues.
###656 We'll be right back.
###657 STEVE: Just take that to Miss Kobrick, OK?
###659 She'll love that for her little bath on Saturday.
###662 NEWSCASTER: That was cool.
###664 STEVE: Three and a half minutes later, I'm done and
###667 what do I do?
###667 No, I don't go to the trailer, not to the green room, fresh
###670 fruit and--
###671 I'm dusting the floor now because we've spilled all over
###674 the place, and we've got another shot back here in
###678 about two and a half minutes.
###681 Hard part about doing live TV is I never know what it really
###683 looks like until the very end and I grab the tape.
###686 Because you never know how it mixes down and what the camera
###688 shots look like.
###689 And in this particular case, there's just one shot there.
###691 So we'll see how the whole thing kind of played, but
###695 that's the only thing they've allowed us to do is the soap
###698 in the microwave, because they were fearful that kids would
###701 try to put the light bulb in the microwave and
###704 it would blow up.
###705 And the chips would be a problem, so if you happen to
###708 see that earlier in the show, you didn't see it, if you know
###710 what I mean.
###712 Just the Ivory soap trick.
###713
