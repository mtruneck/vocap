0:47:28,26 --> 0:47:30,767
Ensign Isel and her daughter
have escaped from their quarters.


742
0:47:30,767 --> 0:47:32,869
Scanning all decks, Captain.


743
0:47:32,869 --> 0:47:34,266
I have them.


744
0:47:34,266 --> 0:47:37,914
Ensign Kirk, get to the transporter
room on the double and detain them.


745
0:47:37,914 --> 0:47:42,362
Spock, your with me.


746
0:47:42,362 --> 0:47:43,453
IRSKA:
Let her go!


747
0:47:43,453 --> 0:47:52,735
The "unnecessary shell"
is my body!


748
0:47:52,735 --> 0:47:57,545
Captain...


749
0:47:57,545 --> 0:47:58,74
No!

[TRANSPORTER DEMATERILIZATION]


753
0:48:13,91 --> 0:48:15,323
Forgive me, Jim.


754
0:48:15,323 --> 0:48:21,26
There was no time to explain.


755
0:48:21,26 --> 0:48:24,86
Where did you send her?


756
0:48:24,86 --> 0:48:29,482
She sent Irska into the cylinder.


757
0:48:29,482 --> 0:48:31,594
You killed her?


758
0:48:31,594 --> 0:48:35,36
No, Captain--


759
0:48:35,36 --> 0:48:39,18
--Her body was the
"unnecessary shell".


760
0:48:39,18 --> 0:48:40,527
She learned to let it go.

[BOSUN WHISTLE]


762
0:48:41,979 --> 0:48:44,504
CHEKOV:
The alien cylinder has
vanished, Captain.


763
0:48:44,504 --> 0:48:47,236
Our hull has returned to normal.


764
0:48:47,236 --> 0:48:52,71
Stand down from red alert, Mr Chekov.


765
0:48:52,71 --> 0:48:55,91
You're all right with this?


766
0:48:55,91 --> 0:49:0,7
Thousands of centuries ago, Irska's
race existed in human form.


767
0:49:0,7 --> 0:49:2,428
Just as humans pass through
all evolutionary stages--


768
0:49:2,428 --> 0:49:7,454
--from single cell to human being
within the mother's womb.


769
0:49:7,454 --> 0:49:12,65
Irska had to experience all stages
of her race's prior development.


770
0:49:12,65 --> 0:49:16,344
So what you are saying is that, Irska,
hasn't even really been born, yet?


771
0:49:16,344 --> 0:49:21,1
Until she had experienced all joys
and pains of living in a body


772
0:49:21,1 --> 0:49:23,113
and was ready to shed the
'unnecessary shell'--


773
0:49:23,113 --> 0:49:28,96
--it represented to her, she was still in
an embryonic state for her race.


774
0:49:28,96 --> 0:49:30,902
I was her first womb.


775
0:49:30,902 --> 0:50:28,56
The Enterprise was her second.


776
0:50:28,56 --> 0:50:32,91
I wish her life with you
could have been longer,


777
0:50:32,91 --> 0:50:36,869
and wish there was some way I could
have made it easier for both of you.


778
0:50:36,869 --> 0:50:38,392
Thank you, Captain.


779
0:50:38,392 --> 0:50:44,9
I appreciate your sentiments, but only
our physical connection has been broken.


780
0:50:44,9 --> 0:50:46,262
Besides--


781
0:50:46,262 --> 0:52:17,798
I hardly expect you to make
improvements on a miracle.
