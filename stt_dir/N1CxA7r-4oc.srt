0:0:2,34 --> 0:0:8,96
About two or three times a century, a massive
in our galaxy explodes. The star's core may


2
0:0:8,96 --> 0:0:14,36
survive as a neutron star or a black hole,
but the rest of it rushes into space as swiftly


3
0:0:14,36 --> 0:0:20,3
expanding debris behind a powerful shockwave.
As the supernova remnant grows, it sweeps


4
0:0:20,3 --> 0:0:26,24
up interstellar gas and gradually decelerates.
Yet even thousands of years later, its imprint


5
0:0:26,24 --> 0:0:29,41
on the galaxy remains impressive.


6
0:0:29,41 --> 0:0:33,84
Exploding stars and their remnants have long
been suspected of producing cosmic rays, some


7
0:0:33,84 --> 0:0:39,23
of the fastest matter in the universe. Where
and how these protons, electrons and atomic


8
0:0:39,23 --> 0:0:45,7
nuclei are boosted to such high speeds has
been an enduring mystery. Now, observations


9
0:0:45,7 --> 0:0:51,39
of two supernova remnants by NASA's Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope provide new insights.


10
0:0:51,39 --> 0:0:55,6
Because cosmic rays carry electric charge,
their direction changes as they travel through


11
0:0:55,6 --> 0:0:57,41
magnetic fields.


12
0:0:57,41 --> 0:1:1,449
By the time the particles reach us, their
paths are completely scrambled. We can't trace


13
0:1:1,449 --> 0:1:6,24
them back to their sources. So scientists
must locate their origins by indirect means,


14
0:1:6,24 --> 0:1:11,189
which is where Fermi comes in. The interaction
of high-energy particles with light and ordinary


15
0:1:11,189 --> 0:1:16,67
matter can produce gamma rays, the most powerful
form of light. Unlike cosmic rays, gamma rays


16
0:1:16,67 --> 0:1:24,359
travel to us straight from their sources.
In 1949, physicist Enrico Fermi worked out


17
0:1:24,359 --> 0:1:30,349
what he called "magnetized clouds" could accelerate
cosmic rays. Later studies showed that a variant


18
0:1:30,349 --> 0:1:36,189
of his method, called Fermi acceleration worked
especially well in supernova remnants.


19
0:1:36,189 --> 0:1:41,389
Confined by a magnetic field, high-energy
particles move around randomly. Sometimes


20
0:1:41,389 --> 0:1:46,59
they cross the shock wave. With each round
trip, they gain about 1 percent of their original


21
0:1:46,59 --> 0:1:51,889
energy. After dozens to hundreds of crossings,
the particle is moving near the speed of light


22
0:1:51,889 --> 0:1:57,739
and is finally able to escape. If the supernova
remnant resides near a dense molecular cloud,


23
0:1:57,739 --> 0:2:3,219
some of those escaping cosmic rays may strike
the gas, and produce gamma rays.


24
0:2:3,219 --> 0:2:8,56
But electrons and protons make gamma rays
in different ways. Cosmic ray electrons do


25
0:2:8,56 --> 0:2:15,4
so when they're deflected by passing near
the nucleus of an atom. Accelerated protons


26
0:2:15,4 --> 0:2:20,2
may collide with an ordinary proton and produce
a short-lived particle called a neutral pion.


27
0:2:20,2 --> 0:2:26,95
These pions quickly decay into a pair of gamma
rays. At their brightest, both types of emission


28
0:2:26,95 --> 0:2:32,0
look very similar. Only with sensitive measurements
at lower gamma-ray energies can scientists


29
0:2:32,0 --> 0:2:34,769
determine which process is responsible.


30
0:2:34,769 --> 0:2:41,209
Now, Fermi observations have done just that.
They conclusively show these supernova remnants


31
0:2:41,209 --> 0:2:46,439
are accelerating protons. When they strike
protons in nearby molecular clouds, they produce


32
0:2:46,439 --> 0:2:52,739
pions... and ultimately the gamma-ray emission
Fermi sees. NASA's Fermi has detected gamma


33
0:2:52,739 --> 0:2:57,9
rays from many more supernova remnants, but
the jury is still out on whether accelerated


34
0:2:57,9 --> 0:3:1,689
protons are always responsible and what their
maximum energies may be. Nevertheless, the


35
0:3:1,689 --> 0:3:7,81
Fermi team has taken a major step--a century
after the discovery of cosmic rays-- in establishing


36
0:3:7,81 --> 0:3:14,3
just where they arise. Something that would
satisfy, but certainly not surprise, the original


37
0:3:14,3 --> 0:5:14,3
Fermi.
