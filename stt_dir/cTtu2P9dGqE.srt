0:0:59,66 --> 0:1:7,979
Last time we were talking about computerized
layout planning and the focus of the last


2
0:1:7,979 --> 0:1:15,84
two lectures has been on the development of
process layouts. In today’s class we are


3
0:1:15,84 --> 0:1:22,55
going to talk about the design of product
layouts or assembly lines and the features


4
0:1:22,55 --> 0:1:36,97
that we have there in product layouts. If
you recall, we had talked about the PQ chart


5
0:1:36,97 --> 0:1:43,36
and in that we are identify the range in which
product layouts and process layouts are used.


6
0:1:43,36 --> 0:1:48,83
Let us briefly recall the features of these
different kinds of production systems and


7
0:1:48,83 --> 0:1:54,53
see which kind of layout is relevant under
what circumstances.


8
0:1:54,53 --> 0:2:1,97
For instance when you talk about kinds of
production systems, we can talk about a flow


9
0:2:1,97 --> 0:2:9,44
shop. A flow shop is essentially a production
system in which the same sets of operations


10
0:2:9,44 --> 0:2:20,12
are performed in sequence repetitively. So
what we have is essentially when the operations


11
0:2:20,12 --> 0:2:27,83
are going to be repeated so that the pattern
of flow of the raw materials through the plant


12
0:2:27,83 --> 0:2:33,63
is constant more or less. That particular
configuration is called a flow shop and in


13
0:2:33,63 --> 0:2:43,44
fact such systems even in assembly line could
be used as a flow shop in that sense. On the


14
0:2:43,44 --> 0:2:50,27
other extreme we can talk about a job shop.
Job shop is something with facilities, capable


15
0:2:50,27 --> 0:2:56,52
of producing many different jobs in small
batches. So the difference between a job shop


16
0:2:56,52 --> 0:3:2,739
and a flow shop is essentially in terms of
the variety of products that we are handling.


17
0:3:2,739 --> 0:3:8,99
In a job shop you can handle a variety of
products and because each product might require


18
0:3:8,99 --> 0:3:15,95
different kinds of processing depending upon
its requirements. You have actually general


19
0:3:15,95 --> 0:3:22,66
purpose machines laid out in the job shop
and each product can go to the respective


20
0:3:22,66 --> 0:3:28,98
machine, get the operations done and then
you to the next particular machine for the


21
0:3:28,98 --> 0:3:35,45
new operations. So what really happens in
the job shop is that the flow pattern is quite


22
0:3:35,45 --> 0:3:41,9
complicated and material handling costs are
pretty high. Basically when you are designing


23
0:3:41,9 --> 0:3:49,24
layouts for such job shops you are basically
talking about the design of process layouts.


24
0:3:49,24 --> 0:3:55,0
What we are talking about is designing a process
layout which can accommodate a variety of


25
0:3:55,0 --> 0:4:0,319
products that you make. That is what we saw
when we were dealing with both the systematic


26
0:4:0,319 --> 0:4:6,6
layout planning procedure of Muether and also
the computerized layout planning packages


27
0:4:6,6 --> 0:4:10,98
which are there for handling such types of
systems.


28
0:4:10,98 --> 0:4:17,819
Of course one can have a production system
which is totally distinct and which is a project


29
0:4:17,819 --> 0:4:24,1
that should be a major one time job requiring
sequencing and coordination among interrelated


30
0:4:24,1 --> 0:4:34,12
tasks. Now in a project therefore things are
done once and for all and there is no need


31
0:4:34,12 --> 0:4:39,46
for repeating whatever you are doing. Generally
a project is a one time activity and therefore


32
0:4:39,46 --> 0:4:46,28
whatever layout emerges is actually a layout
dictated by the particular circumstances.


33
0:4:46,28 --> 0:4:52,88
Therefore there are no formal methods of designing
a layout for a project it is actually dictated


34
0:4:52,88 --> 0:4:58,539
by the various activities which have to be
performed in the project, the kind of equipment


35
0:4:58,539 --> 0:5:4,28
that is to be laid and the kind of terrain
in which the project is to be done. So we


36
0:5:4,28 --> 0:5:8,36
are not really talking about layouts when
you are talking about a project for these


37
0:5:8,36 --> 0:5:20,25
reasons. Now it is important to note that
all these different kinds of production systems


38
0:5:20,25 --> 0:5:30,49
that we have talked about essentially require
resources. Let us recall these resources could


39
0:5:30,49 --> 0:5:37,69
be man power machines, materials, money, energy,
information etc.


40
0:5:37,69 --> 0:5:44,0
They have to be provided to the production
system and the production system will generate


41
0:5:44,0 --> 0:5:50,43
to you the desirable goods and services and
also some undesirable goods and services in


42
0:5:50,43 --> 0:5:59,57
the form of pollutions noise scrap etc. The
purpose of a layout is actually to facilitate


43
0:5:59,57 --> 0:6:7,85
this operation which goes on within the black
box. So we should look at a layout as something


44
0:6:7,85 --> 0:6:14,78
which facilitates the production process and
at the same time tries to improve the productivity


45
0:6:14,78 --> 0:6:21,44
of the production system by enlarged. So it
has to be viewed in that integrated concepts


46
0:6:21,44 --> 0:6:40,59
and not a problem nearly in isolation. This
particular diagram which shows a plot of the


47
0:6:40,59 --> 0:6:49,6
product variety versus the quantity in fact
brings out very beautifully the natural domains


48
0:6:49,6 --> 0:6:58,979
of the flow shop, the job shop and the projects.
For instance if your quantities are small


49
0:6:58,979 --> 0:7:6,99
but the variety is large then this particular
domain is the domain of the project and the


50
0:7:6,99 --> 0:7:15,2
job shops primarily on the other hand when
you increase the quantity and also relatively


51
0:7:15,2 --> 0:7:22,93
reduce the variety in fact, what happens here
is that we are talking here about predictable


52
0:7:22,93 --> 0:7:25,57
variety ion a job shop.


53
0:7:25,57 --> 0:7:32,8
The medium level variety and medium level
quantity is actually the domain of the job


54
0:7:32,8 --> 0:7:44,94
shop and when you are talking about the job
shop, you are primarily talking about the


55
0:7:44,94 --> 0:7:50,949
design of process layouts. Whatever we studied
in layout planning was actually applicable


56
0:7:50,949 --> 0:7:57,29
to the job shops that this particular ends
up the spectrum here. On the other hand if


57
0:7:57,29 --> 0:8:2,79
you have a situation where the quantities
are large and the variety of the product is


58
0:8:2,79 --> 0:8:10,979
relatively low, we come to a domain that is
naturally suited for a flow shop or in assembly


59
0:8:10,979 --> 0:8:18,12
line or in mass production in that sense where
we are basically performing the same set of


60
0:8:18,12 --> 0:8:28,78
operations repetitively without much change.
So in such a case you tend to use a layout


61
0:8:28,78 --> 0:8:34,39
which is generally called the product layout
or we will see how assemble lines are designed


62
0:8:34,39 --> 0:8:38,449
for this. So I think this point needs to be
kept in mind and depending upon the natural


63
0:8:38,449 --> 0:8:46,57
requirements of variety and quantity you choose
the type of layout and it could be a process


64
0:8:46,57 --> 0:8:57,74
layout or it could be a product layout as
things are there. We are all familiar with


65
0:8:57,74 --> 0:9:4,48
the concept of mass manufacture, these things
and mass production. However there are a couple


66
0:9:4,48 --> 0:9:12,99
of ideas in mass production or mass manufacture
which are worthy of note. So we will talk


67
0:9:12,99 --> 0:9:23,11
about some of the key ideas which led to mass
manufacture as a viable entity. You probably


68
0:9:23,11 --> 0:9:30,509
know that the first assembly line was set
up be Henry ford for making cars in the United


69
0:9:30,509 --> 0:9:32,499
States.


70
0:9:32,499 --> 0:9:38,759
But this could not have been possible unless
you have number one a logical breakdown of


71
0:9:38,759 --> 0:9:46,949
work which means the entire task is to be
performed is broken down into smaller and


72
0:9:46,949 --> 0:9:54,449
smaller tasks and some group of tasks are
assigned to one particular individual or a


73
0:9:54,449 --> 0:10:6,29
machine. This breakdown of tasks into smaller
task helps in the division of labor to a very


74
0:10:6,29 --> 0:10:16,17
large extent. As a consequence of that suppose
you could know what is the basic advantage


75
0:10:16,17 --> 0:10:25,47
of the division of labor rather than one person
doing all the jobs involved in an assembly,


76
0:10:25,47 --> 0:10:31,9
if there are ten people doing fractions of
those jobs, what is the specific advantage


77
0:10:31,9 --> 0:10:39,49
that you get by engaging a large number of
people? That is one thing you get. Specialization


78
0:10:39,49 --> 0:10:45,61
of labor that means individual people will
now be focusing on individual tasks and as


79
0:10:45,61 --> 0:10:52,399
a consequence they could become more and more
skilled and learning times will tend to draw


80
0:10:52,399 --> 0:10:59,91
depending on the operation time. The real
advantage of the concept of division of labor


81
0:10:59,91 --> 0:11:7,79
depends on what the assembly line is based.
What is that specific concept?


82
0:11:7,79 --> 0:11:16,759
The major advantage of the division of labor
is the fact that it is much more economical


83
0:11:16,759 --> 0:11:23,3
to produce parts when different people do
the jobs. Why is this so? It is because different


84
0:11:23,3 --> 0:11:28,759
tasks involve different degrees of skill.
So what could happen is that there could be


85
0:11:28,759 --> 0:11:35,389
many tasks that can be performed by an unskilled
operator. Other tasks requires skilled operators


86
0:11:35,389 --> 0:11:41,29
and you can buy along skilled operator at
a much cheaper rate as compared to a skilled


87
0:11:41,29 --> 0:11:45,519
operator for whom you will have to pay that
much. However if you have one skilled operator


88
0:11:45,519 --> 0:11:51,91
doing the whole job then even for the unskilled
job which is done you are actually paying


89
0:11:51,91 --> 0:12:1,29
in at a higher rate. That is what it is. So
you are really underutilizing these capabilities.


90
0:12:1,29 --> 0:12:7,54
If you are employing only one person for doing
all the jobs, this particular fact is in fact


91
0:12:7,54 --> 0:12:13,929
responsible for much of the economic advantage
that you get through the division of layout.


92
0:12:13,929 --> 0:12:20,22
Apart from this of course there are other
factors like development of a skill and these


93
0:12:20,22 --> 0:12:30,119
kinds of things. But I think this must not
pay last site off. The second underlying idea


94
0:12:30,119 --> 0:12:38,23
in mass manufacture is that it is possible
to divide the work into workstations. What


95
0:12:38,23 --> 0:12:44,869
is the work station? Work station will be
a set of tasks; you have now broken down the


96
0:12:44,869 --> 0:12:51,799
original work into smaller tasks. Some of
the tasks are grouped together and assigned


97
0:12:51,799 --> 0:12:57,869
to one particular work station. So at one
particular work station maybe the operator


98
0:12:57,869 --> 0:13:5,379
will take part and will be inspected. It will
be a fixed up component on it and then clean


99
0:13:5,379 --> 0:13:11,299
it and compressed and send it to the next
operation. So here we performed a number of


100
0:13:11,299 --> 0:13:16,779
different tasks. So this grouping of what
task set to be performed by the operator defines


101
0:13:16,779 --> 0:13:26,139
the content of workstation. Basically Adam
Smith was responsible for the basic idea of


102
0:13:26,139 --> 0:13:34,809
the division of labor. He wrote a book called
the wealth of nations in 1776 which was basically


103
0:13:34,809 --> 0:13:40,739
concerned with the advantages of the division
of labor. Henry Ford was credited with the


104
0:13:40,739 --> 0:13:48,769
first person who actually put this ideas together
and develop the first circular and of course


105
0:13:48,769 --> 0:13:53,829
assembly lines could not have been possible
but for this very important contribution by


106
0:13:53,829 --> 0:14:8,559
E Whitney. E Whitney is the person who actually
talked about the concept of tolerances and


107
0:14:8,559 --> 0:14:13,59
fits in meeting parts.


108
0:14:13,59 --> 0:14:20,279
So he in fact showed that if you maintain
the tolerances with the certain range you


109
0:14:20,279 --> 0:14:26,639
could have parts which are interchangeable
and replaceable. This is something very fundamental


110
0:14:26,639 --> 0:14:33,48
to the assembly language. For instance if
you look at the assembly of let us say Maruti


111
0:14:33,48 --> 0:14:43,79
cars, the person has to fit the four tyres
on to the on the wheels of this particular


112
0:14:43,79 --> 0:14:50,149
car. He can pick up one particular wheel,
put it on, put the second wheel, put it on


113
0:14:50,149 --> 0:14:54,199
third wheel, and put it on. We can take any
one of the wheels from the bilor wheels which


114
0:14:54,199 --> 0:14:58,989
are lying within. Why is this possible? Because
of the processes standardization that has


115
0:14:58,989 --> 0:15:6,91
taken place which means essentially the dimensions
confirmed to a certain range. Now in fact


116
0:15:6,91 --> 0:15:13,739
in all assembly lines this happens. The automobiles
are being assembled. We will pick up any carburetor


117
0:15:13,739 --> 0:15:19,829
and fit up the carburetor of the car and followed
by fitting up the next carburetor and so on.


118
0:15:19,829 --> 0:15:24,92
So it does not really make a difference which
carburetor was fitted on to the whole thing,


119
0:15:24,92 --> 0:15:31,489
whereas this kind of thing could not be possible
if standardization was not there.


120
0:15:31,489 --> 0:15:37,9
You know jocularly we can say you are all
seen in the Mahabharata and you know during


121
0:15:37,9 --> 0:15:47,749
the war the chariot of particular prince was
broken. The edges couldn’t replace the wheel


122
0:15:47,749 --> 0:15:54,499
by any standard wheel. It has to go to a specific
carpenter. We have to make wheels specifically


123
0:15:54,499 --> 0:16:5,839
designed for that and then put it on. This
is because that, it was not a standardized


124
0:16:5,839 --> 0:16:10,22
kind of operation, each thing was there. So
unless standardization is done you will not


125
0:16:10,22 --> 0:16:16,47
be able to go for this assembly. So these
are three fundamental concepts which are at


126
0:16:16,47 --> 0:16:26,72
the back of mass manufacture. What is an assembly
line? Assembly line is actually a very sequential


127
0:16:26,72 --> 0:16:33,54
progression of the input material that comes
with one particular point and one edge. Then


128
0:16:33,54 --> 0:16:40,48
it goes to the first workstation. This person
it could be a person, it could be a machine,


129
0:16:40,48 --> 0:16:46,519
anything. This workstation performs certain
operation on it. Sense it to the next operator


130
0:16:46,519 --> 0:16:51,91
who performs those operations which are required
and so on. So at the end of the whole thing,


131
0:16:51,91 --> 0:16:58,799
the final assembled product comes out of the
line. What are the specific features you see


132
0:16:58,799 --> 0:17:5,97
in the assembly line? I think one of the immediate
things which come to mind is that this production


133
0:17:5,97 --> 0:17:8,23
is going to be much faster.


134
0:17:8,23 --> 0:17:14,819
As compared to a process layout, why not,
because these machines are more official.


135
0:17:14,819 --> 0:17:19,25
The same machines could as well be used in
the process layout. So the total processing


136
0:17:19,25 --> 0:17:26,98
time for producing a part could be the same.
The only difference comes because in a process


137
0:17:26,98 --> 0:17:34,82
layout it has to go from one department to
another department. So there are waiting times


138
0:17:34,82 --> 0:17:40,99
then there is cost of transfer and then it
is waiting at the new workstation and then


139
0:17:40,99 --> 0:17:43,76
so on.
Once after the pieces finish, it has to gain


140
0:17:43,76 --> 0:17:51,78
rate of the department. So all these loading,
waiting, traveling is involved in the process


141
0:17:51,78 --> 0:17:58,69
layout. But here the part is some operation
is performed in this part, immediately it


142
0:17:58,69 --> 0:18:3,559
goes to the next machine which is waiting
for the path with open arms. It welcomes to


143
0:18:3,559 --> 0:18:10,59
the part and starts performing the operation.
So the element of material handling time involved


144
0:18:10,59 --> 0:18:16,96
has considerably reduced this system. That
is the reason why these systems are much more


145
0:18:16,96 --> 0:18:25,26
efficient in terms of production time. This
is what it is. Here as some of the advantages


146
0:18:25,26 --> 0:18:31,62
of flow line production system which we are
talking about today. The first advantage is


147
0:18:31,62 --> 0:18:35,42
the smooth flow of material from one work
station to the next.


148
0:18:35,42 --> 0:18:44,32
I just like to point out that this flow need
not only be linear.


149
0:18:44,32 --> 0:18:48,93
You could have material flowing like this
and then coming back like this and then going


150
0:18:48,93 --> 0:18:53,66
in this direction and then coming here. So
it is like a serpentine flow


151
0:18:53,66 --> 0:18:58,94
especially when there are constraints on space
you will find that this kind of flow takes


152
0:18:58,94 --> 0:19:6,34
place. If you see for instance any television
assembly unit probably go to LG or some other


153
0:19:6,34 --> 0:19:11,49
place, you will find that the operators are
set like this and then set like this and then


154
0:19:11,49 --> 0:19:16,28
set like this. So they accommodate many more
people and this is also an assembly line.


155
0:19:16,28 --> 0:19:22,18
Moreover the flow could be a straight line.
It could be U shape flow, it could be this


156
0:19:22,18 --> 0:19:27,87
kind of a flow or it could be even be circular
flow. The idea is that depending upon the


157
0:19:27,87 --> 0:19:32,9
space but the crucial thing is that smooth
flow of material from one workstation to the


158
0:19:32,9 --> 0:19:42,95
next takes place. So this is one of the features.
Since work is fed from one station to the


159
0:19:42,95 --> 0:19:50,97
next small in process inventories result.
This is another major advantage because directly


160
0:19:50,97 --> 0:19:56,98
the piece is going from one workstation to
the other. So there is a much need for having


161
0:19:56,98 --> 0:19:59,85
in process inventories between the two stations.


162
0:19:59,85 --> 0:20:4,33
Though of course there could be some times
some inventories between the stations in the


163
0:20:4,33 --> 0:20:11,68
form of buffer stops for some reasons. The
total production time per unit is quite short


164
0:20:11,68 --> 0:20:19,56
for reason that we just mentioned. There is
reduced material handling, little skill required


165
0:20:19,56 --> 0:20:29,95
by the operators. Hence training is simple
short and inexpensive. Why because the operator


166
0:20:29,95 --> 0:20:37,7
is doing very simple kind of things. This
job might be to pick up the piece from here,


167
0:20:37,7 --> 0:20:44,88
operate a foot pedal where it is held and
then take the compressed here. Then probably


168
0:20:44,88 --> 0:20:49,64
release it and send it the next operation.
So he has to do a couple of things which can


169
0:20:49,64 --> 0:20:57,47
probably be landed in half a day. So training
is quite simple and inexpensive unlike the


170
0:20:57,47 --> 0:21:4,5
training for a process layout. In a process
layout you might have a lathe operator. Lathe


171
0:21:4,5 --> 0:21:8,87
operator must have proper training. You should
be able to read the vernier calipers. You


172
0:21:8,87 --> 0:21:15,71
should know how to operate a lathe. You should
be at least an ITI trained person and so on.


173
0:21:15,71 --> 0:21:22,45
Greater problems are there. In the product
layout production planning and control systems


174
0:21:22,45 --> 0:21:32,12
are simple. Less space is occupied by work
in transit for temporary storage, obviously


175
0:21:32,12 --> 0:21:39,7
because we have less. So transit storage so
that kind of space is not really used to appear.


176
0:21:39,7 --> 0:21:45,57
Whereas if you happen to work flow process
layout, work through for instance what you


177
0:21:45,57 --> 0:21:51,51
find is typically pasting are storm all over
the place. So you probably might not have


178
0:21:51,51 --> 0:21:56,2
space to work through the whole thing. You
have to mind your step as you step from one


179
0:21:56,2 --> 0:22:1,76
costing to the other and you know because
of the storage, there is something like this.


180
0:22:1,76 --> 0:22:6,98
It could not happen at least in a product
layout. It could happen only at the end. The


181
0:22:6,98 --> 0:22:11,23
process layout of course, you will have a
where house. All the cars are stopped and


182
0:22:11,23 --> 0:22:16,18
therefore that is a different thing.


183
0:22:16,18 --> 0:22:22,97
Some of the disadvantages of flow line production
are that a breakdown of one machine may lead


184
0:22:22,97 --> 0:22:29,27
to a complete stoppage of the following machines.
Hence maintenance is a challenging job here.


185
0:22:29,27 --> 0:22:37,36
This is a very significant thing because if
you happen to be in charge of an assembly


186
0:22:37,36 --> 0:22:43,2
line, you got to make sure that the line is
running all the time which means that is,


187
0:22:43,2 --> 0:22:48,87
if there is a request, if there is a breakdown
then maintenance staff has to be on the job


188
0:22:48,87 --> 0:22:54,84
constantly doing this job. This is relatively
in flexible with regard to changes in product


189
0:22:54,84 --> 0:23:4,91
design. We cannot keep on changing the product
design here. The pace of the line is determined


190
0:23:4,91 --> 0:23:12,32
by the bottle neck machine line. Balancing
is thus a major problem in design. Obviously


191
0:23:12,32 --> 0:23:22,1
different operations workstations take different
amounts of time to process the part. The overall


192
0:23:22,1 --> 0:23:27,93
phase of the line will be determined by the
source machine. Therefore you would like to


193
0:23:27,93 --> 0:23:38,0
have as far as possible fairly constant times
for all the sections, all the workstations.


194
0:23:38,0 --> 0:23:45,96
This may not be possible for various reasons
but at least that is the intention.


195
0:23:45,96 --> 0:23:51,76
Supervision is general rather than specialized
as the supervision of a line is looking after


196
0:23:51,76 --> 0:24:0,21
diverse machines on a line. Compare this with
supervisor for a process layout. If you have


197
0:24:0,21 --> 0:24:5,51
a supervisor, let us say in the lathe section
that person could probably have spent ten


198
0:24:5,51 --> 0:24:10,21
years in the lathe section and could be familiar
with all the machines. We can probably open


199
0:24:10,21 --> 0:24:14,93
out each machine and assemble it, that kind
of thing because all are lathes and he has


200
0:24:14,93 --> 0:24:20,8
considerable experience. But this could not
happen because you have one lathe, one milling


201
0:24:20,8 --> 0:24:24,49
machine, one some special kind of machine
and so on. So all machines are distinct in


202
0:24:24,49 --> 0:24:30,94
the line and you don’t expect any person
to be specialized of all of them. Generally


203
0:24:30,94 --> 0:24:35,73
high investments are required owing to the
specialized nature of the machines and their


204
0:24:35,73 --> 0:24:47,89
possible duplication in the line. So this
is also possible here. Now having understood


205
0:24:47,89 --> 0:24:56,1
the features of an assembly line, let us see
for instance we want to go for mass production.


206
0:24:56,1 --> 0:25:4,33
Indecently you must understand that this decision
is primarily economic decision. So just for


207
0:25:4,33 --> 0:25:10,48
the sake of argument you might say for instance,
suppose we have three options, we can either


208
0:25:10,48 --> 0:25:15,62
purchase the path that we are interested in
making for ten rupees a piece and just keep


209
0:25:15,62 --> 0:25:24,41
buying it that is it or we can invest 10,000
rupees and set up some general purpose machines


210
0:25:24,41 --> 0:25:29,54
are individual stations as the case maybe.
Then we will be able to make a path on our


211
0:25:29,54 --> 0:25:35,16
own for 5 rupees a piece and the total cost
will then be the fixed cost and the variable


212
0:25:35,16 --> 0:25:40,6
cost could be of this nature. You might say
that I can spend and make a heavier investment


213
0:25:40,6 --> 0:25:44,88
of 20,000 rupees or whatever it is it is.


214
0:25:44,88 --> 0:25:52,51
Then maybe we can produce the part for 2 rupees
50 paisa per piece and it will be like this.


215
0:25:52,51 --> 0:25:59,34
Now through a simple break even and analysis,
for instance you can find out these two quantities


216
0:25:59,34 --> 0:26:4,75
quantity Q1 and quantity Q2 here. This is
very simple for instance in this particular


217
0:26:4,75 --> 0:26:11,36
case what could be the break even quantity
here for this particular situation?


218
0:26:11,36 --> 0:26:18,97
I mean what we are saying is what could be
the break even quantity here this is like


219
0:26:18,97 --> 0:26:32,99
trying to say 10X is = 2000. So what we can
therefore say is that we can directly determine


220
0:26:32,99 --> 0:26:40,59
this quantity. Let us call this quantity as
Q1 and which is that is say 2000 here. Then


221
0:26:40,59 --> 0:26:44,87
you find out the tradeoff between the other
two options that is between the option of


222
0:26:44,87 --> 0:26:50,7
buying at individual stations and the options
of setting of a full assembly line. So what


223
0:26:50,7 --> 0:26:54,0
could be this value 4000 mean?


224
0:26:54,0 --> 0:27:4,4
This Q2 is 4000 of this simple analysis tells
you something very interesting or it says


225
0:27:4,4 --> 0:27:13,35
is that the least cost option is the one which
is shown here. Therefore if you have demand


226
0:27:13,35 --> 0:27:19,87
that happens in the range of up to 2000 rupees,
it is better to be just by the part from outside,


227
0:27:19,87 --> 0:27:25,8
that is the cheapest option here. If you happen
to be in the rage of 2000, your demand happens


228
0:27:25,8 --> 0:27:30,57
to be in the range of 2000 – 4000. The best
thing could be to goal for this intermediate


229
0:27:30,57 --> 0:27:35,35
option because it will be cheaper in this
case and it will be worth wise to set up an


230
0:27:35,35 --> 0:27:43,21
assembly line only if your quantity of production
demand happens to exceed 4000 rupees that


231
0:27:43,21 --> 0:27:51,72
is all. So you can get quantitative answers
to the questions of finding out what could


232
0:27:51,72 --> 0:27:58,2
be the best thing to do under various circumstances.
So in this particular situation we could go


233
0:27:58,2 --> 0:28:4,28
in for assembly line only if it is 4000. What
might happen in real life is suppose your


234
0:28:4,28 --> 0:28:12,87
current demand is 3500 somewhere here whatever
it is, and then obviously you can think of


235
0:28:12,87 --> 0:28:19,1
the feature. You are expecting a growth in
the next year; it might be worth while to


236
0:28:19,1 --> 0:28:23,22
set up an assembly line considering the fact
that you are going to cross this barrier of


237
0:28:23,22 --> 0:28:31,559
4000 in the next year and so on. So these
kinds of decisions actually have to be taken


238
0:28:31,559 --> 0:28:38,79
before you make this decision of trying to
find out whether you should go for mass production


239
0:28:38,79 --> 0:28:46,48
and when you should go for mass production.
So it is essential. Let us now talk about


240
0:28:46,48 --> 0:28:51,33
the design of the assembly line.


241
0:28:51,33 --> 0:28:55,5
What is the objective in the design of an
assembly line? It is basically to minimize


242
0:28:55,5 --> 0:29:4,49
the total idle time or the number of workstations
for a given assembly lines speed. The basic


243
0:29:4,49 --> 0:29:10,12
information that we have at disposing such
a situation is that we are dividing the work


244
0:29:10,12 --> 0:29:16,3
into parts and this division is known as the
precedence diagram. So the precedence diagram


245
0:29:16,3 --> 0:29:25,75
is basically projection of what other parts
have to be, the components of the parts that


246
0:29:25,75 --> 0:29:35,99
have to be done in overall products and in
what particular sequence. Once we have done


247
0:29:35,99 --> 0:29:43,95
this development of tasks, the basic design
of the assembly line is actually done by grouping


248
0:29:43,95 --> 0:29:51,15
the tasks into work stations. Before we do
this exercise we have to know what the feasible


249
0:29:51,15 --> 0:29:52,8
range of cycle times is.


250
0:29:52,8 --> 0:29:58,22
We will see the feasible range of cycle times
through an example. It can be determined very


251
0:29:58,22 --> 0:30:7,21
easily as something which lies between the
maximum time for an operation and some of


252
0:30:7,21 --> 0:30:13,85
the times for all the operations. Then there
are many algorithms available for the line


253
0:30:13,85 --> 0:30:19,6
balancing process. We have a procedure due
to Helgeson and Birnie which is quite commonly


254
0:30:19,6 --> 0:30:25,76
known as the rank positional weight method.
We also have a procedure due to Kilbridge


255
0:30:25,76 --> 0:30:32,39
and Wester which is based on the number of
predecessors that means priorities are decided


256
0:30:32,39 --> 0:30:39,21
based on the number of predecessors. There
is a procedure due to Arcus called COMSOAL


257
0:30:39,21 --> 0:30:46,65
which is a computerized method for sequencing
operations on assembly lines. The basic philosophy


258
0:30:46,65 --> 0:30:52,47
in this procedure is the generation of alternatives
by simulation and once you generate a large


259
0:30:52,47 --> 0:30:57,6
number of alternatives, you evaluate them
and take the one which have you think is best.


260
0:30:57,6 --> 0:31:3,71
Once we have generated a large number of options,
the next stage is choosing the best design.


261
0:31:3,71 --> 0:31:11,59
Choice of the best design obviously depends
upon things like balance delay and ideal time


262
0:31:11,59 --> 0:31:22,59
for the operation should be minimum. So this
is a broad set of picture of assembly line


263
0:31:22,59 --> 0:31:31,309
design procedure. Let us now take an example.
What we have here is a precedence diagram


264
0:31:31,309 --> 0:31:38,54
and the precedence diagram shows that 1, 2,
3 and so on up to 12 are the individual operations


265
0:31:38,54 --> 0:31:39,17
or tasks


266
0:31:39,17 --> 0:31:45,33
We are assuming these tasks cannot be further
divided. This could be like drilling a hole.


267
0:31:45,33 --> 0:31:51,97
So obviously drilling a hole cannot be divided
into drilling one quarter of the hole and


268
0:31:51,97 --> 0:31:56,72
then draw in the next quarter of the hole.
So this is that one particular operation which


269
0:31:56,72 --> 0:32:3,48
is indivisible. So we have divided the entire
tasks in to the twelve operations and this


270
0:32:3,48 --> 0:32:9,29
network diagram shows the precedence requirements
that are operation one has to be performed


271
0:32:9,29 --> 0:32:16,25
first. Then two and four can be performed,
similarly six can be performed only when three


272
0:32:16,25 --> 0:32:23,55
and five are over in that sense. The figures
here refer to the duration of each task. So


273
0:32:23,55 --> 0:32:30,33
the duration of the tasks could be determined
by a time study or whatever other procedures


274
0:32:30,33 --> 0:32:37,7
you have. You know the time required to do
this individual task. From this we would like


275
0:32:37,7 --> 0:32:43,15
to possibly design an assembly line. Let us
see how we can design an assembly line manually


276
0:32:43,15 --> 0:32:51,24
for this operation and then we will compare
it by using the rank positional weight technique.


277
0:32:51,24 --> 0:32:56,87
Now clearly in this particular case we are
going to group these operations. So one thing


278
0:32:56,87 --> 0:33:3,95
is clear, the maximum time that is required
for any operation is seven and the minimum


279
0:33:3,95 --> 0:33:8,55
what is the total time required for all the
operations could be some of the times of all


280
0:33:8,55 --> 0:33:14,88
the operations which is fifty. This clearly
means that any assembly line for this precedence


281
0:33:14,88 --> 0:33:23,58
diagram will have a cycle time which will
range between seven and fifty. This defines


282
0:33:23,58 --> 0:33:34,32
the limit on the cycle time for any design.
In this particular example, the number of


283
0:33:34,32 --> 0:33:42,59
work elements is 12, the cycle time will live
between T max and summation Ti is = 1 to N


284
0:33:42,59 --> 0:33:44,4
so seven is the bottle neck operation.


285
0:33:44,4 --> 0:33:48,97
The operation which takes the longest time
in the cycle time will therefore live between


286
0:33:48,97 --> 0:34:2,57
fifty. Now you talk about the desired cycle
time. A desired cycle time must be somewhere


287
0:34:2,57 --> 0:34:8,69
between these two operations between these
two limits. So let us say about desired cycle


288
0:34:8,69 --> 0:34:15,919
time is ten. How does the desired cycle time
come about? It is based on the market demand.


289
0:34:15,919 --> 0:34:21,95
It depends upon how many you want to produce
per day so cycle time is determined accordingly.


290
0:34:21,95 --> 0:34:26,52
This is something the marketing people would
be actually telling you if there is a demand


291
0:34:26,52 --> 0:34:31,28
for so many cars per day therefore your cycle
time should be search. So we say that the


292
0:34:31,28 --> 0:34:38,609
desired cycle time is ten and we have this,
so this cycle time should be within this range.


293
0:34:38,609 --> 0:34:47,839
Obviously if the cycle time happens to be
more than fifty, what is going to be the implication?


294
0:34:47,839 --> 0:34:56,579
The implication is that you don’t require
an assembly line. Your cycle time happens


295
0:34:56,579 --> 0:35:5,14
to be more than fifty itreally means that
you require a piece that is 60 minutes. What


296
0:35:5,14 --> 0:35:11,38
you can do is you can gain one percent, he
will do all the tasks in 50 minutes and still


297
0:35:11,38 --> 0:35:16,39
have ten minutes free with him. You do not
really heed to set up an assembly line if


298
0:35:16,39 --> 0:35:22,89
you are in this particular range. You can
use that person for ten minutes and you can


299
0:35:22,89 --> 0:35:30,71
do something else. You don’t need here and
on the other hand if your cycle time is less


300
0:35:30,71 --> 0:35:36,989
than seven what are you going to do? Suppose
my demand is search there I need a cycle time


301
0:35:36,989 --> 0:35:46,109
of five or three. On this side you need multiple
lines on this side, you have one line and


302
0:35:46,109 --> 0:35:51,98
beyond this you don’t need any assembly
line. So this gives your clear idea as to


303
0:35:51,98 --> 0:35:58,63
when you need and how many lines.
So let us take for this example a situation


304
0:35:58,63 --> 0:36:3,599
that the desired cycle time is ten. This is
now feasible and it should be between seven


305
0:36:3,599 --> 0:36:11,769
and fifty. Let us now try to find out or design
the line for us.


306
0:36:11,769 --> 0:36:21,46
What we are basically trying to do is our
objective is to group the work elements into


307
0:36:21,46 --> 0:36:28,509
stations so that no stations time exceeds
ten units. That is what we trying to say because


308
0:36:28,509 --> 0:36:33,7
if it exceeds ten units, our cycle time will
be more than ten and we are designing the


309
0:36:33,7 --> 0:36:42,93
line for a cycle time of ten units. How do
we attain this? We could do it by inspection


310
0:36:42,93 --> 0:36:52,95
and no algorithm. Just look at the precedence
diagram and this is the feasible solution


311
0:36:52,95 --> 0:37:1,98
what we can say is I can club these two operations
one and two and this takes five minutes, five


312
0:37:1,98 --> 0:37:7,9
seconds or minutes whatever with the unit
of time five + three, so the workstation one


313
0:37:7,9 --> 0:37:10,19
will take eight units of time.


314
0:37:10,19 --> 0:37:18,869
I should not exceed ten. This is now three
and six, so this takes a time of nine. This


315
0:37:18,869 --> 0:37:26,539
one takes four + five which is nine. This
takes two + four which is six, this takes


316
0:37:26,539 --> 0:37:36,21
six + four which is ten and this takes seven
+ one which is eight. What we are able to


317
0:37:36,21 --> 0:37:45,9
do is by simply grouping parts, now what is
the objective in grouping? In grouping, some


318
0:37:45,9 --> 0:37:53,94
of the time must not exceed ten. So I have
six workstations. What is the workstations


319
0:37:53,94 --> 0:37:58,98
I have exactly defined? What is to be done
at this workstation? I t means the persons


320
0:37:58,98 --> 0:38:4,529
going to sit at workstation one will first
do a operation one and take five minutes and


321
0:38:4,529 --> 0:38:9,95
then do operation four which will take three
minutes thereby taking a total of eight minutes


322
0:38:9,95 --> 0:38:16,109
here and so on for the next operator in the
next operand. So I have a design of an assembly


323
0:38:16,109 --> 0:38:23,269
line which as six operators and we exactly
know what each operator has to do. This is


324
0:38:23,269 --> 0:38:33,14
basically the idea of an assembly line which
we just date by simple common sense logic


325
0:38:33,14 --> 0:38:38,63
which we can do this one. However to evaluate
how good this design is you could need some


326
0:38:38,63 --> 0:39:3,739
performance measures. You can have for instance
if this is the bottle neck operation you can


327
0:39:3,739 --> 0:39:9,839
have two machines here in parallel and each
machine will have a in mean effective time


328
0:39:9,839 --> 0:39:17,2
of only 3.5,in that point of view and then
your bottle neck will be maybe six this will


329
0:39:17,2 --> 0:39:26,22
be six which will be the bottle six as you
can work that way also. Are you can look for


330
0:39:26,22 --> 0:39:32,489
a superior machine which instead of taking
seven minutes we will take etcetera and whatever


331
0:39:32,489 --> 0:39:40,59
is your requirement. So for this particular
example that we just worked out we can calculate


332
0:39:40,59 --> 0:39:45,89
something called the line efficiency. What
is the efficiency of this line and this is


333
0:39:45,89 --> 0:39:50,9
nothing but the summation of all the station
times


334
0:39:50,9 --> 0:39:55,239
Summation of the station times will be nothing
but the total time for all the jobs so you


335
0:39:55,239 --> 0:40:1,279
have fifty divided by K. K is the number of
workstations the number of workstations that


336
0:40:1,279 --> 0:40:7,119
we have got a six into the cycle time of the
line is ten. Notice that the cycle time need


337
0:40:7,119 --> 0:40:13,45
not be always ten because when you are doing
this grouping you are constrained by saying


338
0:40:13,45 --> 0:40:18,7
that it should be less than ten. So just we
have got lesser than here. Suppose this value


339
0:40:18,7 --> 0:40:25,41
and then only eight then our cycle time could
have been nine although we started to design


340
0:40:25,41 --> 0:40:34,88
a line for a cycle time of ten. So we have
here ten and then of course the line efficiency


341
0:40:34,88 --> 0:40:41,69
works out to 83.3 percent. One minus the line
efficiency is called balance delay. It is


342
0:40:41,69 --> 0:40:46,569
a nature of the inefficiency of the operation
really. So it is a nature of the idleness


343
0:40:46,569 --> 0:40:54,69
of the different stations. When we talk about
idleness, what you see out of a total of ten


344
0:40:54,69 --> 0:40:59,13
minutes, this value is idle for two minutes.
This is idle for one minute, one minute, four


345
0:40:59,13 --> 0:41:6,43
minutes. This is not idle at all and this
is idle for two minutes. So we would like


346
0:41:6,43 --> 0:41:11,729
this idle time to be as small as possible
and ideal situation could be, the line is


347
0:41:11,729 --> 0:41:16,42
perfectly balanced that everyone is doing
the same amount of tasks. That is generally


348
0:41:16,42 --> 0:41:22,769
not possible. Why? Because the times are integral
number one and then you have a constraint


349
0:41:22,769 --> 0:41:26,69
and precedence. We cannot group everything
into everything else.


350
0:41:26,69 --> 0:41:31,849
You are not way for instance raise that you
can put something here and make it exactly


351
0:41:31,849 --> 0:41:36,14
two hundred and fifty grams. It is not possible
to do that because you are dealing with these


352
0:41:36,14 --> 0:41:44,259
individual entities which have to be grouped
together. So the balance delay is 16.7 percent


353
0:41:44,259 --> 0:41:50,65
and the smoothness index for this is a is
a term for an assembly line which is nothing


354
0:41:50,65 --> 0:41:57,19
but the this is the idle time ST max, maximum
station time that mean that is the cycle time


355
0:41:57,19 --> 0:42:3,369
minus Sti, which is the station time of the
ith operation and whole square. So it will


356
0:42:3,369 --> 0:42:9,999
be for each operation. So what we have to
look at is this example, idle time here is


357
0:42:9,999 --> 0:42:18,539
two. So two square is four and here it is
nine, so this idle is 14 + 1 + 1 and this


358
0:42:18,539 --> 0:42:25,249
is sixteen because the idle time here is four.
Four four sixteen no idle time here and then


359
0:42:25,249 --> 0:42:32,69
four. So root of twenty six which is 5.09
and closer to zero the better if a line is


360
0:42:32,69 --> 0:42:39,979
perfectly balanced this smoothness index will
be zero. So we try to minimize these smoothness


361
0:42:39,979 --> 0:42:45,95
index so we have got measures of the efficiency
of this design, you got a line which has an


362
0:42:45,95 --> 0:42:52,47
efficiency of 83.3 percent. Balance delay
of 60.7 percent and a smoothness index of


363
0:42:52,47 --> 0:43:3,64
5.09, this is what we have. Now let us see
how we can use one of the standard procedures


364
0:43:3,64 --> 0:43:11,2
available. We will discuss the so called ranked
positional weight method for developing the


365
0:43:11,2 --> 0:43:11,66
line.


366
0:43:11,66 --> 0:43:19,479
We will compare the design with the design
that we had obtained by induction as it is


367
0:43:19,479 --> 0:43:25,999
possible. So the positional weight of a work
element is its own processing time plus the


368
0:43:25,999 --> 0:43:33,47
processing time of all the following work
elements. We define a positional weight for


369
0:43:33,47 --> 0:43:39,589
each element in the precedence diagram by
same, that this is the time of that operation


370
0:43:39,589 --> 0:43:46,13
plus times of all operations which follow
it. The basic idea could be that the total


371
0:43:46,13 --> 0:43:51,829
positional weight will give you an idea, how
much time it will take, at least to go to


372
0:43:51,829 --> 0:43:59,289
the end from that operation that happens to
be the idea. This is used subsequently in


373
0:43:59,289 --> 0:44:7,89
defining your priority for assigning jobs
to workstations that is the only thing. At


374
0:44:7,89 --> 0:44:14,819
each workstation a list of an eligible job
is prepared for the placement. In the rank


375
0:44:14,819 --> 0:44:20,19
positional weight technique, the work element
with the highest positional weight is selected


376
0:44:20,19 --> 0:44:24,569
and that is why it is called ranked positional
weight is selected and is assigned to the


377
0:44:24,569 --> 0:44:31,529
current workstation.
So that is the basic logic of the RPW technique.


378
0:44:31,529 --> 0:44:42,29
Let us try to apply this technique to the
example that we are considering earlier. What


379
0:44:42,29 --> 0:44:48,479
you notice in this precedence diagram is the
same precedence diagram that we have. The


380
0:44:48,479 --> 0:44:57,18
times are shown on top of each operation but
the figures are available in the squares at


381
0:44:57,18 --> 0:45:1,97
the bottom or the positional weights. Let
us look at them. You start calculating the


382
0:45:1,97 --> 0:45:8,66
positional weight from the back. So what do
you see is for operation number twelve the


383
0:45:8,66 --> 0:45:14,599
positional weight is seven because this will
take only seven units of time?


384
0:45:14,599 --> 0:45:20,759
You come to eleven then from eleven, this
is the operation and this is the following


385
0:45:20,759 --> 0:45:27,359
operation for this. So seven plus four eleven
will be the positional weights for this elements.


386
0:45:27,359 --> 0:45:32,749
Similarly thirteen is the positional weight
for this element which is six plus seven;


387
0:45:32,749 --> 0:45:37,109
similarly for nine the positional weight will
be what follows it which is seven plus one


388
0:45:37,109 --> 0:45:44,99
which is eight. When you come to job number
six for instance what happens is it is not


389
0:45:44,99 --> 0:45:49,59
necessarily fifteen plus eight plus fifteen
that will be the positional weight for this,


390
0:45:49,59 --> 0:45:56,239
that the point that you have to get. It is
all that these jobs are successors of this


391
0:45:56,239 --> 0:46:4,99
job. So the time required two plus six plus
seven plus one plus four plus four, the total


392
0:46:4,99 --> 0:46:8,63
time required for all these jobs is twenty
four if you add the five also


393
0:46:8,63 --> 0:46:14,589
and therefore this becomes the positional
weight for this particular job. For job number


394
0:46:14,589 --> 0:46:20,67
three, the positional weight will be simply
whatever follows this plus so twenty four


395
0:46:20,67 --> 0:46:24,839
is the positional weight here twenty four
plus four which is twenty eight. Similarly


396
0:46:24,839 --> 0:46:29,88
here is going to be twenty four plus six which
is thirty. Thirty plus three thirty three


397
0:46:29,88 --> 0:46:37,14
thirty one twenty eight plus three is thirty
one. When you come here obviously it is going


398
0:46:37,14 --> 0:46:41,39
to be some of the all the jobs which come
to plus five. So the total positional weight


399
0:46:41,39 --> 0:46:50,19
is fifty here. So the numbers that we have
computed here can be computed in one run starting


400
0:46:50,19 --> 0:46:55,289
from the back and coming to the front and
getting these particular numbers. Now these


401
0:46:55,289 --> 0:47:4,93
numbers will define and will actually tell
us how to determine then try how to go about


402
0:47:4,93 --> 0:47:8,41
designing the assembly line.


403
0:47:8,41 --> 0:47:12,589
See designing an assembly line is now based
on these numbers and this is how we proceed.


404
0:47:12,589 --> 0:47:18,739
For instance you start with a first basket
which is the first workstation. You open the


405
0:47:18,739 --> 0:47:23,789
first workstation and at the first workstation
this is the only job which is eligible because


406
0:47:23,789 --> 0:47:29,819
it has no precedence relationships. So one
will be put there and the moment you put one,


407
0:47:29,819 --> 0:47:36,999
we have consumed five units of time and two
and four are again candidates for placement.


408
0:47:36,999 --> 0:47:42,9
But out of two and four we will take four
because it is a higher positional weight.


409
0:47:42,9 --> 0:47:47,7
So we will put four here and once we put four
here, one and four will consume a total time


410
0:47:47,7 --> 0:47:54,609
of 8 and we can go up to a maximum time of
ten. There is no other job available at this


411
0:47:54,609 --> 0:47:59,589
junction which can be accommodated within
this. So we close this particular workstation


412
0:47:59,589 --> 0:48:7,369
with work time of 8 units and proceed to the
next station.


413
0:48:7,369 --> 0:48:12,91
When you proceed to the next station, this
has been placed. There are two jobs completing


414
0:48:12,91 --> 0:48:19,18
for placement in this particular work station.
This 1, 2 and 5 and out of these, this one


415
0:48:19,18 --> 0:48:25,869
has a higher positional weight so we take
two and place it first. When you place two,


416
0:48:25,869 --> 0:48:32,69
three can be placed too and five can be placed
but out of the two this will get a priority.


417
0:48:32,69 --> 0:48:37,849
So it can be accommodated because the total
time is going to be only nine, so you can


418
0:48:37,849 --> 0:48:43,259
put this. You keep proceeding in this particular
fashion and you will keep on filling these


419
0:48:43,259 --> 0:48:49,749
buckets. The movement you cannot enter anything
more into this bucket you open the next bucket.


420
0:48:49,749 --> 0:48:53,63
So we are now at the first workstation, the
second one, the third one, the fourth one,


421
0:48:53,63 --> 0:48:59,94
and fifth one and sixth one. So in this design
two we have been able to determine the six


422
0:48:59,94 --> 0:49:6,45
workstations and also the operations which
are to be done at these individual work stations


423
0:49:6,45 --> 0:49:11,29
and these are the cycle times. Since this
has the highest cycle time which is ten that


424
0:49:11,29 --> 0:49:16,539
means this particular line will now operate
for a cycle time of ten, as we have decided


425
0:49:16,539 --> 0:49:18,71
earlier.


426
0:49:18,71 --> 0:49:27,239
So what we can do is we can look up and can
try to evaluate this particular design. We


427
0:49:27,239 --> 0:49:34,16
can see for instance that the evaluation of
the design by the RPW method. Again the balanced


428
0:49:34,16 --> 0:49:40,479
delay in the line efficiency of the same is
because the balance delay and the line efficiency


429
0:49:40,479 --> 0:49:46,92
are determined by the number of workstations.
In this design also you have six workstations


430
0:49:46,92 --> 0:49:52,779
in the previous design and you get six workstations.
So practically what is the minimum number


431
0:49:52,779 --> 0:50:0,789
of workstations? How will you calculate this?
You have fifty which is your total work content


432
0:50:0,789 --> 0:50:6,99
and your cycle time is ten, fifty by ten which
five is.


433
0:50:6,99 --> 0:50:13,13
Ideally you can work with the theoretical
minimum number of workstations are five but


434
0:50:13,13 --> 0:50:21,329
in the two procedures that you have just adopted,
we could not we could have these individual


435
0:50:21,329 --> 0:50:29,65
operations into five workstations. So the
balance delay is 16.7 percent. The line efficiency


436
0:50:29,65 --> 0:50:36,79
is 83.3 percent and this particular case.
However if you look at the smoothness index,


437
0:50:36,79 --> 0:50:43,769
there is an improvement in the smoothness.
The smoothness index is found for this design.


438
0:50:43,769 --> 0:50:50,309
Look at the ideal times here, 2 2 square which
is 4 1 square which is 1 1 square which is


439
0:50:50,309 --> 0:51:1,79
1 3 square which is 9 0 and 3 and 3 squares
which is 9. The square root of this is 4.9


440
0:51:1,79 --> 0:51:6,39
is an improvement on the earlier smoothness
index that we have. It means this is slightly


441
0:51:6,39 --> 0:51:16,89
better balanced line as compare to the previous
one. So we can therefore look at the precedence


442
0:51:16,89 --> 0:51:23,989
diagram and from the precedence diagram depending
upon the RPWs, depending upon the positional


443
0:51:23,989 --> 0:51:33,529
weights, we can determine how to fill up these
individual workstations and come up with design.


444
0:51:33,529 --> 0:51:38,99
Subsequently we can evaluate the design in
terms of the three major parameters, balance,


445
0:51:38,99 --> 0:51:47,719
delay, line efficiency and the smoothness
index for these particular situations. The


446
0:51:47,719 --> 0:51:59,799
question now is what are the possible reasons
for high balance delay? Balance delay measures


447
0:51:59,799 --> 0:52:5,619
the inefficiency line; inefficiency means
the degree of idle time which is there for


448
0:52:5,619 --> 0:52:7,88
the various operators.


449
0:52:7,88 --> 0:52:17,67
Some of the reasons for this are:
1. The wide range of work element times. What


450
0:52:17,67 --> 0:52:25,869
can happen is for instance in your example
the work element times will not be constant


451
0:52:25,869 --> 0:52:31,859
for all the operations. If all the work element
time references in one each or even smaller


452
0:52:31,859 --> 0:52:39,109
than this one, then you could combine them
into getting any operation time. But this


453
0:52:39,109 --> 0:52:44,18
does not happen. Some work element time maybe
only one unit second, work element time might


454
0:52:44,18 --> 0:52:49,38
be 12 units and you have to take it as it
is because the operations are not further


455
0:52:49,38 --> 0:52:54,749
divisible.
2. Another possibility could be a large amount


456
0:52:54,749 --> 0:53:2,559
of inflexible line mechanization. What might
happen in the practical design situation is


457
0:53:2,559 --> 0:53:7,489
that you already have a line and you already
have a great degree of mechanization. So when


458
0:53:7,489 --> 0:53:13,99
you have placed some machines at certain stations
which already perform a certain number of


459
0:53:13,99 --> 0:53:18,499
operations, you are actually constrained by
putting in those operations and that particular


460
0:53:18,499 --> 0:53:24,719
point although might not result in the best
balance delay. This could be another reason.


461
0:53:24,719 --> 0:53:32,14
3. Then indiscriminate choice of cycle times
could also lead to high balance device. What


462
0:53:32,14 --> 0:53:38,95
it means is if you know that in our example
we consider the feasible range of cycle times


463
0:53:38,95 --> 0:53:48,539
was from 7 units to 50 units, a wide range
is in it. So you could attempt to do a line


464
0:53:48,539 --> 0:53:57,319
of cycle time of let us say seven or a cycle
time of ten or a cycle time of fifteen or


465
0:53:57,319 --> 0:54:2,829
cycle time of whatever it is. If you do that
then for different cycle times, you will probably


466
0:54:2,829 --> 0:54:9,799
not get the right time. You might get a high
balance delay. These are at least some of


467
0:54:9,799 --> 0:54:18,42
the reasons why you have high balance delay.
Let us now look at some of the problems and


468
0:54:18,42 --> 0:54:26,89
prospects of mass production. You see for
instance that one of the major problems of


469
0:54:26,89 --> 0:54:34,819
mass production is that the variable work
element times. We have designed the line based


470
0:54:34,819 --> 0:54:43,329
on deterministic times but if an operator
is doing a manual task then it is quite likely


471
0:54:43,329 --> 0:54:48,269
that the task time is normally distributed
with certain mean and certain variance. So


472
0:54:48,269 --> 0:54:53,43
sometimes you operator will take less some
times the operator will take more. Then you


473
0:54:53,43 --> 0:55:0,43
will probably find that there could be starvation
for these subsequent machines in that sense


474
0:55:0,43 --> 0:55:1,819
of the term.


475
0:55:1,819 --> 0:55:6,599
What is done is in order to deal with this
problem sometimes buffers are provided in


476
0:55:6,599 --> 0:55:13,92
between the tasks. What can happen is even
if this fellow is slow, or this machine is


477
0:55:13,92 --> 0:55:20,579
slow, this particular person can keep on operating
from these buffers. So this is the variable


478
0:55:20,579 --> 0:55:24,88
effect of the variable work element time.
In fact this problem of finding out the optimum


479
0:55:24,88 --> 0:55:31,91
buffer is an optimization problem. A problem
which can be determined and then there could


480
0:55:31,91 --> 0:55:37,489
be a breakdown at a workstation. If there
is a breakdown at workstation what will happen?


481
0:55:37,489 --> 0:55:43,859
Since the line is all connected, where there
is a breakdown they will be flooding of parts


482
0:55:43,859 --> 0:55:48,14
and beyond that there will be starving of
parts. All the other machines will be start.


483
0:55:48,14 --> 0:55:52,63
So that is why you have to get back into operation
as early as possible and we said the maintenance


484
0:55:52,63 --> 0:55:54,859
stop has to be very quick.


485
0:55:54,859 --> 0:56:0,209
There could be multi product lines that mean
the same line can produce multiple products


486
0:56:0,209 --> 0:56:5,779
this can happen. For instance in Maruti udyog
the same line can produce a Maruti 800, you


487
0:56:5,779 --> 0:56:11,589
can also produce a Zen because what we do
is we change some operations and something


488
0:56:11,589 --> 0:56:16,509
can be done. So designing multi product lines
means that you can handle the same thing.


489
0:56:16,509 --> 0:56:21,209
We can also talk about modular production
and group technology which is an alternative


490
0:56:21,209 --> 0:56:29,499
to assembly lines. This means that you can
talk about grouping parts in a certain fashion.


491
0:56:29,499 --> 0:56:37,509
So that you can achieve modular production
and cellular manufacturing which will try


492
0:56:37,509 --> 0:56:43,849
to capture the advantages of both product
and process layouts and that is the basic


493
0:56:43,849 --> 0:56:49,93
feature of cellular manufacture and of course
automation and robotics have their role to


494
0:56:49,93 --> 0:56:55,759
play. When you are talking about assembly
lines, many operations can be automated. You


495
0:56:55,759 --> 0:57:3,29
can have robots performing many of the operations.
Typically for instance in automobile manufacturing


496
0:57:3,29 --> 0:57:11,219
you find that robots perform this operation
of spot welding of various sheets and components


497
0:57:11,219 --> 0:57:20,69
and we can also use FMS and CIM systems to
perform and automate and programs and some


498
0:57:20,69 --> 0:57:28,749
of the operations that have to be done. Finally
let us try to summarize what we have tried,


499
0:57:28,749 --> 0:57:33,279
what we have done in this particular class.
We will try to look at the advantages and


500
0:57:33,279 --> 0:57:43,279
disadvantages of assembly lines or products
layouts. We have seen the basic principles


501
0:57:43,279 --> 0:57:45,599
involved in the design of assembly lines.


502
0:57:45,599 --> 0:57:51,329
We found that the basic principles involve
things like division of labor and interchangeability


503
0:57:51,329 --> 0:57:59,489
of parts. Contributions by Adam Smith and
by E Whitney help us operate the assembly


504
0:57:59,489 --> 0:58:4,63
line and then we saw that the assembly the
precedence diagram and market requirements


505
0:58:4,63 --> 0:58:10,4
of the design are the two major inputs you
need for designing an assembly line. So you


506
0:58:10,4 --> 0:58:16,569
need the precedence diagram and the desired
cycle time, the rate you would like to produce


507
0:58:16,569 --> 0:58:24,99
the part at. We could like to do the grouping
of elements in a product layout. This could


508
0:58:24,99 --> 0:58:29,19
be done by various algorithms. We mention
some of them and we actually looked at the


509
0:58:29,19 --> 0:58:35,17
RPW procedure in some detail. We found that
they were measures and efficiency like balance


510
0:58:35,17 --> 0:58:40,759
delay line efficiency and smoothness index
for a line and finally we talked about some


511
0:58:40,759 --> 0:58:46,369
of the emerging concepts which could be in
the nature of multi product lines. The provision


512
0:58:46,369 --> 0:58:55,39
for a buffer automation and worker empowerment
is a very important concept, originally given


513
0:58:55,39 --> 0:59:1,109
by the Japanese which allows the operator
to run the line at his will. That means you


514
0:59:1,109 --> 0:59:5,65
can stop the line when there is a problem.
All the workers get together and they repair


515
0:59:5,65 --> 0:59:11,509
the line and then they go back to the respective
places in from the line. So these are some


516
0:59:11,509 --> 0:59:20,609
of the concepts which are there for productiveness.
I think with this we have been talking mainly


517
0:59:20,609 --> 0:59:26,549
about the strategic aspects of design of a
production system in this course. Now we will


518
0:59:26,549 --> 0:59:32,99
go over to the operational decisions which
are relevant in a production system. We talk


519
0:59:32,99 --> 0:59:50,519
about the problem of forecasting aviate production
planning and planning production system.


520
0:59:50,519 --> 0:61:50,519
Thank you!
