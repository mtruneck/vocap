###0 First Lady Michelle Obama: So welcome to the White House, the South Lawn!
###4 What do you think?
###5 Child: I like it!
###5 First Lady Michelle Obama: You like it?
###7 It's okay?
###9 It's awesome?
###10 It's awesome.
###11 Well, you -- this is a beautiful day, because it was like a
###13 hundred-and-a-million degrees here on Monday and it would have
###17 been miserable to be out here.
###18 But we got a perfect day, and this is a very special day for
###23 the White House Kitchen Garden because in addition to
###26 harvesting some of the lettuces, I think we've got broccoli
###29 that's ready.
###30 What else are we going to do?
###31 What's ready?
###33 Are we going to get some of the rhubarb that we --
###35 we got rhubarb.
###36 You see those big huge leaves?
###38 That's rhubarb.
###40 And it's huge!
###41 It's like an elephant's ear.
###43 So we're going to pick some of that and we're going to use some
###45 of that food in the White House to feed the President's family
###49 and our guests.
###50 But we're also going to give it away to people who need good,
###54 healthy food who don't have homes.
###57 So we're going to be able to get a lot done.
###59 But we're also going to do a Three Sisters planting today
###64 because last week we launched a special new part of our
###68 "Let's Move" initiative.
###69 Do you guys know all about "Let's Move,"
###71 what we're trying to do?
###73 Have you heard about it?
###75 We're going to try to make sure that all you kids grow up
###78 healthy, knowing what to eat, knowing how to exercise.
###81 It's a whole initiative to work with people all across the
###85 country to think about how we eat and how we move our bodies
###89 so that you guys grow up healthy and strong and able to do well
###93 in school and be successful in life.
###95 That's what the whole "Let's Move" effort is about.
###98 But last week we launched a new component of the program called
###103 Let's Move Indian Country.
###106 And we're working specifically with young kids in the Native
###110 American community all across the country.
###113 And this planting is a special way to highlight that
###118 new initiative.
###120 And this is the first time ever that we're going to do a Three
###122 Sisters planting here in the White House Kitchen Garden.
###125 And you all are going to be a part of making that happen.
###128 Is that -- does that sound okay?
###130 Yeah, yeah, sounds fun?
###132 So we're not going to talk too long.
###133 I'm going to turn it over to our special guest, Jefferson Keel,
###137 and he's going to tell us a little bit about the Three
###140 Sisters planting, and he's going to do a blessing, okay?
###144 So let's listen up, and then we'll get to work, okay?
###148 All right, here we go.
###148 I'm going to turn it over.
###150 Jefferson keel: Thank you, ma'am.
###152 Thank you.
###153 The idea for the three sisters as we call it,
###158 they are interconnected.
###160 The three sisters are beans, squashes, and corn.
###165 And they work together to protect each other and to help
###169 each other grow.
###170 The beans provide protection or nutrients for the corn,
###174 the corn converts nitrogen for the beans,
###178 and the squash has large leaves to protect the beans from animals.
###184 And, of course, the Secret Service here will protect these I am sure.
###188 But they work together to nurture each other,
###193 to help us to reap those and then help us as we consume those.
###199 So that is what we call -- that is why we call them the three sisters.
###204 So today we are going to plant those.
###206 But before that, we always prepare ourselves and we go
###213 prior to planting, we go to the creator.
###216 We ask God to bless those.
###218 So I am going to do a brief prayer.
###221 And I am going to ask for a special blessing on three things.
###224 One, I am going to ask for a special blessing on all things
###227 God has created.
###229 Ask a special blessing on the First Lady and her efforts to
###232 help us to move Native America.
###237 And then for the healing of Mother Earth and the seeds that
###240 were planted so that that they can continue to nurture us.
###243 So will you pray with me?
###245 Okay.
###246 (speaking foreign language)
###257 Father, we thank you for this beautiful day that you have given us.
###261 We ask a special blessing on the First Lady and her family.
###265 We ask that you would just keep your hand on them and guide them
###268 and protect them Lord.
###270 We ask a special blessing on the seeds that we planted here today.
###274 The corn, (foreign lanuage) the beans, (foreign language),
###278 and the squash, (foreign language).
###282 We ask that you would just heal Mother Earth so that she can
###285 continue to nurture us.
###287 And, Father, I want to ask a special blessing on the young
###291 men and women around the world who are protecting our freedoms
###294 that we might enjoy today and the freedoms that we enjoy in America.
###298 Father, we ask all of these things in the precious and holy
###301 name of Jesus, amen.
###303 All: Amen.
###305 First lady Michelle Obama: Amen.
###307 All right.
###307 Let's go plant.
###308 You guys ready?
