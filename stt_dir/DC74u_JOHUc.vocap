###0 FAT JEW: So, as a parent, you consistently tried to set
###3 boundaries, and I consistently did not want to
###8 exist within them.
###9 SOL: That is what parents do.
###12 You have to set boundaries.
###14 
###19 FAT JEW: The thing is, I do have to say, I have to blame
###22 you for my small penis.
###26 That's your fault.
###27 SOL: No, that's your mother's side of the family.
###29 Yes, it is.
###29 FAT JEW: I've seen--
###30 I mean, not to make it weird, but I've seen your penis.
###32 SOL: Yeah.
###33 FAT JEW: I guess it's probably been about 10 years, but I saw
###36 your penis about 10 years ago.
###38 SOL: It was cold.
###39 It was the middle of winter.
###39 FAT JEW: You were in the house.
###40 The heat was on.
###42 And your penis just looked like a chestnut, like a fat,
###45 little chestnut.
###46 SOL: All right, son.
###48 FAT JEW: That's your fault.
###48 Not to be like, it's my dad's fault!
###50 But you gave me a small dick.
###52 SOL: OK.
###53 FAT JEW: No?
###54 SOL: No.
###54 I still think you probably--
###56 you know, you did have that nearsighted problem.
###61 FAT JEW: So now it's my vision.
###63 SOL: Yeah.
###63 FAT JEW: All right, if you want to be a jerk about it,
###65 not only your dick was fat like a chestnut, it was kind
###68 of mangled.
###70 It was not--
###71 you don't have a good-looking dick.
###72 SOL: Once again--
###73 FAT JEW: You're a nice-looking guy.
###74 I'm not saying you're not a nice-looking guy.
###75 I'm saying you don't have a nice-looking dick.
###76 SOL: OK, but, you know, I hate to lay this at your mother's
###80 doorstep once again--
###81 FAT JEW: Right.
###81 SOL: --but--
###82 FAT JEW: Don't lay anything involving my penis at my
###84 mother's doorstep.
###85 That's just--
###87 that's weird.
###87 SOL: Oh, well.
###88 FAT JEW: That's weird.
###88 SOL: Well, most parents would probably be embarrassed to
###91 even sit here and talk to you about it.
###93 FAT JEW: Yeah, but you're kind of an open dude.
###95 SOL: Well, sure.
###96 FAT JEW: You're an open guy.
