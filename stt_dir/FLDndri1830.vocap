###29 HAMILTON MORRIS: Juan lights a stick on fire and gets it
###31 glowing orange.
###33 
###35 The captain does not react.
###37 He takes two more burns the same way, and then Juan begins
###40 to rub the jelly into all three wounds.
###42 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###43 
###47 HAMILTON MORRIS: Does he feel anything?
###48 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###51 MALE SPEAKER: He's beginning to feel it.
###53 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###55 
###64 HAMILTON MORRIS: The captain stands with a
###66 far-off look in his eye.
###67 
###71 Then he sits down and puts his head in his hands.
###74 He says that everything is spinning, and that he can feel
###76 it in his gut.
###77 
###103 They pour a bucket of water over his burns and head
###106 because they think it will counteract the venom.
###108 
###111 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###112 
###122 HAMILTON MORRIS: And then the captain jumps
###124 into the piss river.
###127 He looks at me and says that he's fine.
###130 Now it's my turn.
###131 
###140 Juan picks up a stick off the ground and lights it on fire.
###144 It's much thicker than the sticks the Mayoruna use.
###147 
###150 Ah!
###152 
###155 Ah!
###158 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###159 
###163 HAMILTON MORRIS: No sensation yet, no sensation yet.
###166 Now it stings.
###167 
###170 The site of the burn now hurts a lot more than when he
###175 initially did it.
###176 Still no psychoactive effect.
###180 No psychedelic effect.
###181 No visual distortions.
###183 
###186 Gracias.
###186 Gracias.
###188 Nothing at first.
###189 Then slowly, an opiated high creeps over me--
###193 a drunken-headedness.
###194 It feels good.
###196 I feel high, or sort of a little bit disassociated.
###204 It's not necessarily unpleasant.
###206 
###211 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###212 
###221 MALE SPEAKER: What's your feeling right now, man?
###224 HAMILTON MORRIS: Very little.
###225 I mean, I feel an extreme pain in my arm where I was burned
###229 and had venom rubbed in the wound.
###231 And I feel a little bit high, in a good way.
###236 Let me get one more.
###238 
###244 Ooh!
###245 Yowza.
###246 
###256 You got it that time?
###257 Did you get it that time?
###259 Si.
###260 
###262 Good, yeah, everybody make sure they touch it.
###265 Jesus Christ!
###266 
###271 Juan then reapplies the poison jelly to my wounds.
###274 
###278 Reapply to the other wounds while you're at it.
###282 Please fan me?
###284 
###287 If they need to give me a thousand of these
###290 I'll fucking do it.
###292 Now there's a new sensation taking over the arm like it's
###298 falling asleep.
###298 Like a pins and needles sort of sensation.
###300 And it's happening in both of my hands.
###302 I'm losing sensation in both of my hands.
###306 It's feeling more sinister now.
###309 It's very strange.
###312 My mind is saturated with a distinct drunken weirdness.
###319 It's bad.
###320 It's unpleasant.
###321 
###331 Part of me wants to lay down.
###332 Just lay down in the hammock or something.
###334 
###342 Ah, gracias, gracias, gracias.
###345 
###353 I feel like a frog.
###355 
###363 The people that surround me fan me like I'm an emperor.
###366 I lay shirtless on a plastic tarp.
###369 My stomach is in excruciating pain.
###371 The frog and me exchange a glance.
###373 
###387 If they think I should do another one, I would consider
###389 doing another one.
###390 I request a fourth burn--
###393 more sapo than The Captain.
###395 Who's the mujer now?
###397 
###409 Numero quattro.
###412 Oh, wow, yeah.
###414 Feeling it much more strongly in my head now.
###417 MALE SPEAKER: Oh yeah?
###417 The drunkenness in my head is very strong.
###420 
###424 There's some mild, closed-eye visuals.
###427 It does feel slightly psychedelic.
###433 I think it might be best for me to lay in my hammock now.
###437 Unless they think I should wash my wounds.
###442 I'm feeling extremely woozy.
###446 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###450 HAMILTON MORRIS: The captain insists that I submerge myself
###453 in the shit river in order to sober myself up.
###456 I say I don't want to.
###458 There's no pharmacological reason that getting wet would
###461 clear the venom from my bloodstream.
###463 But he insists, so I let him pour gasoline jugs of piss
###466 over my head.
###468 
###476 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###477 
###509 HAMILTON MORRIS: As the frog is returned to a tree, I lay
###512 down in the boat because I'm feeling extremely nauseous.
###517 The poison that was still in my blood begins working its
###520 purging magic.
###522 The captain takes me out to a private clearing on the edge
###525 of the river.
###526 
###532 For most people, the frog causes
###534 uncontrollable vomiting.
###536 But I did the frog on an empty stomach, so in my case the
###539 purge came the other way.
###541 
###545 Aspects of the experience were euphoric and I would consider
###548 repeating it.
###549 But I'm pretty certain I could achieve the exact same effects
###553 by rubbing the jelly inside my nose.
###554 
###558 Neither the water nor the purging made me sober.
###562 And I lay in my hammock feeling disassociated and
###565 nauseous for the next three hours.
###567 I feel really fucked up.
###569 Really exhausted, like I just ate a pound of Valium.
###573 And I don't feel too great.
###577 I think I could still vomit at any moment.
###580 
###588 My stomach is just in awful turmoil.
###591 
###611 I wake up today feeling like shit.
###613 I do not have supernatural powers, nor do I have a
###617 resistance to thirst or hunger.
###619 How these drug rumors get started, I have no idea.
###623 Indians, right?
###624 I eat an egg for breakfast and pet the monkey orphan's head
###629 one last time.
###630 Goodbye little monkey.
###632 I wish him the best.
###633 I hope he grows up big and strong, and that he's treated
###637 like a child.
###638 
###641 Then it's time for gift giving.
###643 We give the shaman's family our hammocks, our boots, as
###648 well as an erotic porcelain statuette of two pigs making
###651 love which they seem to cherish.
###653 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###655 
###672 I like them.
###673 
###678 So we got what we wanted.
###680 I did the frog.
###681 It was insane.
###683 I have the scars right now which are starting to heal.
###689 But we also went to the jungle and got a giant bale of
###696 ayahuasca vine.
###697 And it left me a little hungry for some ayahuasca.
###702 So once we get back to Tabatinga we're
###705 going to look around.
###705 Apparently it's very common to find the DMT containing leaves
###710 and we'll mix up some ayahuasca on our own.
###713 
###719 Returning to the city fills me with an incredible joy.
###722 My mosquito bites become less itchy, my sunburn's less
###725 peely, and my intestine less colonized by parasites.
###729 The skies are clear and the banks of the Amazon are
###732 monotonously beautiful.
###734 Tomorrow I will prepare the magical brew.
###736 Tonight, I rest.
###737 
###752 We're back in Tabatinga.
###753 And we're on our way to meet the ayahuasca shaman who's
###757 going to give us something they call tue, which I think
###760 is the DMT-containing plant.
###763 Because when we were still in the jungle, the shaman there
###767 only gave us half of the ayahuasca brew.
###770 So now we're going to get the rest and we'll mix
###774 it up at the hotel.
###775 
###778 We arrive at the shaman's house, and I'm surprised to
###780 find it's a wizened old woman wearing an all pink outfit.
###785 We asked her if she has tue to sell to us.
###787 She tells us she does, but that if I were to drink it I
###791 would permanently lose my mind.
###792 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###794 
###802 HAMILTON MORRIS: Can you ask her if tue has other names?
###805 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###806 
###816 HAMILTON MORRIS: She leads us through her house, and then
###819 out to her garden of medicinal plants.
###821 She brings us to a plant and tells us that is tue.
###825 This is the tue, I'm assuming.
###827 Some people are calling it the Colombian Devil's Breath.
###830 They call it a Angel's Trumpet, Devil's Trumpet.
###833 It's the deliriant that will give me a
###835 miserable nightmare trip.
###836 And this is what the shaman was telling me that I needed
###840 to get, was this Devil's Trumpet stuff.
###844 It's good we cleared that up and he didn't have any on him
###847 at the time because that would have been really
###849 unfortunate for me.
###850 She then brings me to another corner of her garden, where we
###853 see a small tree with lush, green leaves.
###855 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###857 
###860 HAMILTON MORRIS: Fantastic.
###861 This is the chacruna, or psychotria viridis plant.
###868 It contains DMT and pretty much nothing else.
###873 This is, I think, the gold standard for
###877 ayahuasca and brewing.
###880 We pay for the chacruna, and leave for our hotel with all
###884 the ingredients needed to brew ayahuasca.
###886 
###891 Our hotel was nice enough to let me use their kitchen
###893 brewing ayahuasca for the rest of the afternoon.
###895 
###904 In two hours I'll strain what's left, and
###909 that will be that.
###910 
###913 Here we are at our hotel room in Tabatinga, and I just
###917 finished brewing the ayahuasca.
###919 This is the MAOI, it's the ayahuasca vine.
###921 Definitely the worst thing I've ever tasted, and I've
###923 tasted a lot of terrible, terrible drugs.
###926 But I'm going to try and get through about half of this.
###930 Here I go.
###932 
###951 Oh my God.
###952 
###958 OK.
###959 
###973 Little sips, it's too difficult to swallow big ones.
###977 
###984 Around sunset I start drinking the vine.
###987 It's truly the most awful-tasting substance on the
###989 planet, and each sip takes me within a nano-gag of vomiting.
###993 
###998 Sip, gag, sip, gag.
###1000 The vine hits me like a tsunami of warm milk.
###1003 I've never been so drowsy in my life.
###1005 
###1016 I then drink the chacruna leaves.
###1018 I fall asleep and have strange, apocalyptic dreams.
###1021 
###1029 As I fall deeper into an ayahuasca induced trance,
###1032 strange visions and dark premonitions overtake me.
###1036 In the midst of these visions, I realize that the sapo is
###1038 only one amphibian enigma in an endless jungle of mind
###1042 altering mysteries.
###1044 There's so much territory left to explore--
###1047 hypnotic giraffe bone marrow in Sudan, sedative sea sponges
###1052 in the Caribbean, dream fish of the Pacific Ocean, narcotic
###1056 silkworms in China, and unknown synthetics from
###1059 magical laboratories across the globe.
###1062 Whoa.
###1065 Oh my God.
###1066 
###1076 The ayahuasca makes me extremely tired.
###1079 I take a Ritalin to combat the sleepiness.
###1083 Yup.
###1085 I guess it's time for a walk.
###1087 
###1091 Coma juice.
###1092 
###1100 It just made me into a thousand year old man.
###1104 
###1119 I got a boat.
###1122 It's really just like the boat we were in.
###1124 It's the exact same boat, only it's a lot more feathers than
###1134 the boat we were on.
###1136 And that's one hammock in the middle--
###1138 it's a one-person.
###1139 
###1162 The frog was good.
###1164 What's next?
###1165
