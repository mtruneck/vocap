1
0:0:27,61 --> 0:0:28,61



2
0:0:28,61 --> 0:0:30,61
Well thanks very much.  Today is a really


3
0:0:30,61 --> 0:0:32,61
an exciting opportunity.  Indeed,


4
0:0:32,61 --> 0:0:34,61
that was very energizing, the last session.


5
0:0:34,61 --> 0:0:36,61
We hope to carry that forward and add a little of,


6
0:0:36,61 --> 0:0:38,61
a little bit of clarity, to the vector


7
0:0:38,61 --> 0:0:40,61
that we're on.  I truly think that this is


8
0:0:40,61 --> 0:0:42,61
a unique moment in history.  We are retiring the


9
0:0:42,61 --> 0:0:44,61
space shuttle. We've, uh,


10
0:0:44,61 --> 0:0:46,61
been transitioning the international space


11
0:0:46,61 --> 0:0:48,61
station from one of assembly, to operations


12
0:0:48,61 --> 0:0:50,61
and utilization.  And using that as a


13
0:0:50,61 --> 0:0:52,61
cornerstone of our human space


14
0:0:52,61 --> 0:0:54,61
flight operations and activities to go


15
0:0:54,61 --> 0:0:56,61
beyond low Earth orbit for,


16
0:0:56,61 --> 0:0:58,61
uh, for the duration.


17
0:0:58,61 --> 0:1:0,61
And so, um,


18
0:1:0,61 --> 0:1:2,61
I think it was a fitting introduction


19
0:1:2,61 --> 0:1:4,61
about rising


20
0:1:4,61 --> 0:1:6,61
to the occasion.  And, so what I'd like to do


21
0:1:6,61 --> 0:1:8,61
is, I've got a great couple of


22
0:1:8,61 --> 0:1:10,61
folks on the panel.


23
0:1:10,61 --> 0:1:12,61
I encourage you to take a look at the bios


24
0:1:12,61 --> 0:1:14,61
if you're interested, on page 43


25
0:1:14,61 --> 0:1:16,61
of your, uh, of your


26
0:1:16,61 --> 0:1:18,61
notebook.


27
0:1:18,61 --> 0:1:20,61
Garry Lyles, 35 plus years in the


28
0:1:20,61 --> 0:1:22,61
in the business,


29
0:1:22,61 --> 0:1:24,61
doing everything from systems


30
0:1:24,61 --> 0:1:26,61
integration through program management,


31
0:1:26,61 --> 0:1:28,61
to, uh, leading


32
0:1:28,61 --> 0:1:30,61
most recently, our analysis


33
0:1:30,61 --> 0:1:32,61
of alternatives.  Leading the


34
0:1:32,61 --> 0:1:34,61
study teams looking at our


35
0:1:34,61 --> 0:1:36,61
critical next decisions, looking at


36
0:1:36,61 --> 0:1:38,61
in an objective, thorough


37
0:1:38,61 --> 0:1:40,61
and absolutely complete way.


38
0:1:40,61 --> 0:1:42,61
Uh, our future


39
0:1:42,61 --> 0:1:44,61
heavy lift launch vehicle,


40
0:1:44,61 --> 0:1:46,61
and the space launch systems


41
0:1:46,61 --> 0:1:48,61
options that we're looking at.


42
0:1:48,61 --> 0:1:50,61
He is truly a quintessential


43
0:1:50,61 --> 0:1:52,61
engineer and uh,


44
0:1:52,61 --> 0:1:54,61
and just an asset to the agency.


45
0:1:54,61 --> 0:1:56,61
And, uh, following his,


46
0:1:56,61 --> 0:1:58,61
uh, following his talk


47
0:1:58,61 --> 0:2:0,61
uh, we'll have Maria.


48
0:2:0,61 --> 0:2:4,61
Maria Collura, she is the Deputy Director


49
0:2:4,61 --> 0:2:6,61
of the Space Transportation Planning Office.


50
0:2:6,61 --> 0:2:8,61
Engaged in


51
0:2:8,61 --> 0:2:10,61
our critically important


52
0:2:10,61 --> 0:2:12,61
activities associated with


53
0:2:12,61 --> 0:2:14,61
commercial crew, uh,


54
0:2:14,61 --> 0:2:16,61
to both the international space station


55
0:2:16,61 --> 0:2:18,61
and low Earth orbit.  She has just,


56
0:2:18,61 --> 0:2:20,61
uh, come off


57
0:2:20,61 --> 0:2:22,61
the, uh, the highly


58
0:2:22,61 --> 0:2:24,61
energized and much-anticipated


59
0:2:24,61 --> 0:2:26,61
CCDev-2 announcement.


60
0:2:26,61 --> 0:2:28,61
And so, I think she'll give you some great


61
0:2:28,61 --> 0:2:30,61
insight into that.  Collectively,


62
0:2:30,61 --> 0:2:32,61
these things will help


63
0:2:32,61 --> 0:2:34,61
outline and add some clarity


64
0:2:34,61 --> 0:2:36,61
to the path that we're on.  But, this


65
0:2:36,61 --> 0:2:38,61
is a path that's not yet fully written.


66
0:2:38,61 --> 0:2:40,61
It's one that we are indeed looking to


67
0:2:40,61 --> 0:2:42,61
you, and to share with you


68
0:2:42,61 --> 0:2:44,61
the current status.  So, much


69
0:2:44,61 --> 0:2:46,61
like we wove


70
0:2:46,61 --> 0:2:48,61
a little bit of storytelling


71
0:2:48,61 --> 0:2:50,61
into the past.  I'm going to tell you a


72
0:2:50,61 --> 0:2:52,61
little bit of the why.  Same thing from an


73
0:2:52,61 --> 0:2:54,61
integrative perspective.  I'm going to tell you some of the how


74
0:2:54,61 --> 0:2:56,61
and then it's about participation.


75
0:2:56,61 --> 0:2:58,61
So, we'll do the


76
0:2:58,61 --> 0:3:0,61
engage part last.


77
0:3:0,61 --> 0:3:2,61
Um, I'll start off.


78
0:3:2,61 --> 0:3:4,61
I'm going to give you a little bit of perspective,


79
0:3:4,61 --> 0:3:6,61
kind of a scene setter, here.


80
0:3:6,61 --> 0:3:8,61
And then, I'll dive into my specific pitch.


81
0:3:8,61 --> 0:3:10,61
It's going to be on the human exploration


82
0:3:10,61 --> 0:3:12,61
architecture team.


83
0:3:12,61 --> 0:3:14,61
Some of the near-term work that we've been doing,


84
0:3:14,61 --> 0:3:16,61
and, uh, and the results of that.


85
0:3:16,61 --> 0:3:18,61
As well as the, uh, as well as


86
0:3:18,61 --> 0:3:20,61
the steps ahead.  So, essentially


87
0:3:20,61 --> 0:3:22,61
this just gives you a little snapshot of the vision.


88
0:3:22,61 --> 0:3:24,61
Talk about the budget context


89
0:3:24,61 --> 0:3:26,61
and the capability-driven exploration,


90
0:3:26,61 --> 0:3:28,61
talk about what that means.


91
0:3:28,61 --> 0:3:30,61
Talk about this human exploration framework team, give you


92
0:3:30,61 --> 0:3:32,61
a little bit of insight into


93
0:3:32,61 --> 0:3:34,61
uh, the game plan, our concept


94
0:3:34,61 --> 0:3:36,61
of operations.  Also, talk about


95
0:3:36,61 --> 0:3:38,61
affordability which is a fundamental driver,


96
0:3:38,61 --> 0:3:40,61
much like safety


97
0:3:40,61 --> 0:3:42,61
and, uh, performance


98
0:3:42,61 --> 0:3:44,61
and mission execution.  Talk about


99
0:3:44,61 --> 0:3:46,61
the HAT, which is the follow on work


100
0:3:46,61 --> 0:3:48,61
and I'll wrap it all up.


101
0:3:48,61 --> 0:3:50,61
So, you know, it was an interesting


102
0:3:50,61 --> 0:3:52,61
comment on the organization chart. [ Audience Laughter ]


103
0:3:52,61 --> 0:3:54,61
Well, you, know why I put this one in here,


104
0:3:54,61 --> 0:3:56,61
is, we have about 32 plus direct reports


105
0:3:56,61 --> 0:3:58,61
to the administrator, right.


106
0:3:58,61 --> 0:4:0,61
And, essentially the point I'm trying to make with this


107
0:4:0,61 --> 0:4:2,61
is we have a huge


108
0:4:2,61 --> 0:4:4,61
amount of people engaged.


109
0:4:4,61 --> 0:4:6,61
Every facet across the spectrum:


110
0:4:6,61 --> 0:4:8,61
from people, resources to


111
0:4:8,61 --> 0:4:10,61
to infrastructure, to budget,


112
0:4:10,61 --> 0:4:12,61
to dealing with Congress and the White House,


113
0:4:12,61 --> 0:4:14,61
to the performance, to the missions


114
0:4:14,61 --> 0:4:16,61
to the design people, the safety of the mission assurance,


115
0:4:16,61 --> 0:4:18,61
the engineering and everybody in between.


116
0:4:18,61 --> 0:4:20,61
And it's a ten center effort.


117
0:4:20,61 --> 0:4:22,61
This is what NASA is about.


118
0:4:22,61 --> 0:4:24,61
This is, what is


119
0:4:24,61 --> 0:4:26,61
uh, this is the group or the


120
0:4:26,61 --> 0:4:28,61
body that we have to engage.


121
0:4:28,61 --> 0:4:30,61
Plus, you bring in Congress, and


122
0:4:30,61 --> 0:4:32,61
Congress is not a monolithic body.


123
0:4:32,61 --> 0:4:34,61
We've got the 111th, which passed


124
0:4:34,61 --> 0:4:36,61
the Authorization Act of 2010


125
0:4:36,61 --> 0:4:38,61
in bi-partisan fashion,


126
0:4:38,61 --> 0:4:40,61
signed by the president.  But now,


127
0:4:40,61 --> 0:4:42,61
we have the 112th, and that's a whole


128
0:4:42,61 --> 0:4:44,61
new ballgame.  And, if you, you know, just watch


129
0:4:44,61 --> 0:4:46,61
the political theater playing out.  You've got


130
0:4:46,61 --> 0:4:48,61
the White House, you've got the OMB--


131
0:4:48,61 --> 0:4:50,61
the Office of Management and Budget,


132
0:4:50,61 --> 0:4:52,61
the OSTP.  All the different players,


133
0:4:52,61 --> 0:4:54,61
plus the industry stakeholders,


134
0:4:54,61 --> 0:4:56,61
international, other governmental agencies,


135
0:4:56,61 --> 0:4:58,61
and, uh, and academia.


136
0:4:58,61 --> 0:5:0,61
Add that all to the mix and you


137
0:5:0,61 --> 0:5:2,61
wonder why it's a little bit challenging


138
0:5:2,61 --> 0:5:4,61
to get some decisions.  Everybody has a voice.


139
0:5:4,61 --> 0:5:6,61
And, boy, for ten people in a room


140
0:5:6,61 --> 0:5:8,61
you'll probably get 11 or 12


141
0:5:8,61 --> 0:5:10,61
different opinions, because as people go around


142
0:5:10,61 --> 0:5:12,61
they actually change their story a little bit.


143
0:5:12,61 --> 0:5:14,61
So, that's kind of the soup, or


144
0:5:14,61 --> 0:5:16,61
kind of some of the dynamics that we're playing with.


145
0:5:16,61 --> 0:5:18,61
Um,


146
0:5:18,61 --> 0:5:20,61
and we've got a clear vision, you know,


147
0:5:20,61 --> 0:5:22,61
from our newest release of the


148
0:5:22,61 --> 0:5:24,61
2011 strategic plan.


149
0:5:24,61 --> 0:5:26,61
NASA's strategic goals are


150
0:5:26,61 --> 0:5:28,61
those six listed there.


151
0:5:28,61 --> 0:5:30,61
And, I highlighted in blue the first one:


152
0:5:30,61 --> 0:5:32,61
Extending and sustaining human activities


153
0:5:32,61 --> 0:5:34,61
activities across the solar system.


154
0:5:34,61 --> 0:5:36,61
That's a real big driver for our exploration activities.


155
0:5:36,61 --> 0:5:38,61
But, so too is blending in


156
0:5:38,61 --> 0:5:40,61
a tight synergy with the science side.


157
0:5:40,61 --> 0:5:42,61
You know, developing the technologies


158
0:5:42,61 --> 0:5:44,61
and the capabilities that are necessary


159
0:5:44,61 --> 0:5:46,61
to not only enable and


160
0:5:46,61 --> 0:5:48,61
expand these capabilities, but also


161
0:5:48,61 --> 0:5:50,61
to add huge value to


162
0:5:50,61 --> 0:5:52,61
back here, terrestrially


163
0:5:52,61 --> 0:5:54,61
on the planet Earth.


164
0:5:54,61 --> 0:5:56,61
And, uh, to our national and international economic future


165
0:5:56,61 --> 0:5:58,61
as well as benefiting


166
0:5:58,61 --> 0:6:0,61
all of humanity.  Tying in


167
0:6:0,61 --> 0:6:2,61
our programmatic and institutional


168
0:6:2,61 --> 0:6:4,61
capabilities is ever


169
0:6:4,61 --> 0:6:6,61
more important, given the scarcity


170
0:6:6,61 --> 0:6:8,61
and constrained resources that we have.


171
0:6:8,61 --> 0:6:10,61
And, finally, it's about sharing this.


172
0:6:10,61 --> 0:6:12,61
Uh, not only engaging people


173
0:6:12,61 --> 0:6:14,61
in a two-way fashion,


174
0:6:14,61 --> 0:6:16,61
but sharing this awesome,


175
0:6:16,61 --> 0:6:18,61
and this is the best sense of the word,


176
0:6:18,61 --> 0:6:20,61
message and future that we do have together.


177
0:6:20,61 --> 0:6:22,61
So, essentially the budget overview


178
0:6:22,61 --> 0:6:24,61
for exploration systems.


179
0:6:24,61 --> 0:6:26,61
So, we've got a little under $4 billion.


180
0:6:26,61 --> 0:6:28,61
So, if you can't do something with $4 billion,


181
0:6:28,61 --> 0:6:30,61
something is wrong, right?


182
0:6:30,61 --> 0:6:32,61
We've got a heck of a lot, a heck of a lot of


183
0:6:32,61 --> 0:6:34,61
opportunity here. We do have, uh,


184
0:6:34,61 --> 0:6:36,61
and you know, everybody, uh everybody


185
0:6:36,61 --> 0:6:38,61
is concerned about,


186
0:6:38,61 --> 0:6:40,61
about the, uh, about the, dollars, but this is


187
0:6:40,61 --> 0:6:42,61
really $240 million


188
0:6:42,61 --> 0:6:44,61
above what we, uh, what our FY11


189
0:6:44,61 --> 0:6:46,61
authorized level was.


190
0:6:46,61 --> 0:6:48,61
It does fund


191
0:6:48,61 --> 0:6:50,61
a really diverse portfolio across


192
0:6:50,61 --> 0:6:52,61
uh, across


193
0:6:52,61 --> 0:6:54,61
a broad portfolio


194
0:6:54,61 --> 0:6:56,61
of capabilities.


195
0:6:56,61 --> 0:6:58,61
ISS is at the corner piece of that, for human space flight ops.


196
0:6:58,61 --> 0:7:0,61
And, uh, and


197
0:7:0,61 --> 0:7:2,61
it's also designed


198
0:7:2,61 --> 0:7:4,61
specifically to maintain US


199
0:7:4,61 --> 0:7:6,61
leadership and to engage


200
0:7:6,61 --> 0:7:8,61
in beyond low Earth orbit,


201
0:7:8,61 --> 0:7:10,61
or beyond LEO capabilities


202
0:7:10,61 --> 0:7:12,61
and development for the future.


203
0:7:12,61 --> 0:7:14,61
It also has a


204
0:7:14,61 --> 0:7:16,61
strong underpinning in developing


205
0:7:16,61 --> 0:7:18,61
and leveraging the


206
0:7:18,61 --> 0:7:20,61
commercial space industry.


207
0:7:20,61 --> 0:7:22,61
And that's for safe and affordable access


208
0:7:22,61 --> 0:7:24,61
to the international space station,


209
0:7:24,61 --> 0:7:26,61
and also helping to enable


210
0:7:26,61 --> 0:7:28,61
the broader activities beyond.


211
0:7:28,61 --> 0:7:30,61
That also includes the


212
0:7:30,61 --> 0:7:32,61
Space Launch System and the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle


213
0:7:32,61 --> 0:7:34,61
for, uh,


214
0:7:34,61 --> 0:7:36,61
our destinations and


215
0:7:36,61 --> 0:7:38,61
multiple destinations beyond low Earth orbit,


216
0:7:38,61 --> 0:7:40,61
as well as, uh, as well as


217
0:7:40,61 --> 0:7:42,61
the other activities.


218
0:7:42,61 --> 0:7:44,61
So, that's a little snapshot. This is the quick overview,


219
0:7:44,61 --> 0:7:46,61
Essentially, this


220
0:7:46,61 --> 0:7:48,61
budget enables us to work, uh,


221
0:7:48,61 --> 0:7:50,61
certainly.  We already talked about ISS


222
0:7:50,61 --> 0:7:52,61
being highly leveraged, both


223
0:7:52,61 --> 0:7:54,61
in a utilization sense for exploration benefit.


224
0:7:54,61 --> 0:7:56,61
We are looking


225
0:7:56,61 --> 0:7:58,61
to identify those quick


226
0:7:58,61 --> 0:8:0,61
those, uh, those quick


227
0:8:0,61 --> 0:8:2,61
wins as well as the longer-term


228
0:8:2,61 --> 0:8:4,61
set of technology


229
0:8:4,61 --> 0:8:6,61
and research capabilities that will allow


230
0:8:6,61 --> 0:8:8,61
us to conquer challenges in environmental


231
0:8:8,61 --> 0:8:10,61
control and life support systems.


232
0:8:10,61 --> 0:8:12,61
Irradiation.  Extended duration of radiation.


233
0:8:12,61 --> 0:8:14,61
Extended duration micro-gravity experience


234
0:8:14,61 --> 0:8:16,61
or countermeasures.


235
0:8:16,61 --> 0:8:18,61
And, so those are some of the critical


236
0:8:18,61 --> 0:8:20,61
drivers as well as


237
0:8:20,61 --> 0:8:22,61
propulsion and habitation


238
0:8:22,61 --> 0:8:24,61
and dealing with the, uh,


239
0:8:24,61 --> 0:8:30,61
dealing with the delay and disruption tolerant communications capabilities that we'll be


240
0:8:30,61 --> 0:8:34,61
needing for extended beyond low Earth orbit exploration.


241
0:8:34,61 --> 0:8:36,61
Likewise, it will


242
0:8:36,61 --> 0:8:38,61
allow us to aggressively pursue those human


243
0:8:38,61 --> 0:8:40,61
research and life support


244
0:8:40,61 --> 0:8:42,61
and habitation things that we talked about


245
0:8:42,61 --> 0:8:44,61
for technology capability


246
0:8:44,61 --> 0:8:46,61
development perspective.


247
0:8:46,61 --> 0:8:48,61
And, very consistent with the


248
0:8:48,61 --> 0:8:50,61
national space policy, this


249
0:8:50,61 --> 0:8:52,61
is all about huge partnerships


250
0:8:52,61 --> 0:8:54,61
with not only inter-agency folks,


251
0:8:54,61 --> 0:8:56,61
but internationals,


252
0:8:56,61 --> 0:8:58,61
academia and industry.


253
0:8:58,61 --> 0:9:0,61
And by industry, we're talking new space,


254
0:9:0,61 --> 0:9:2,61
old space, we're talking


255
0:9:2,61 --> 0:9:4,61
non-traditional space, we're partnering with


256
0:9:4,61 --> 0:9:6,61
people like Google and Caterpillar,


257
0:9:6,61 --> 0:9:8,61
John Deere, and


258
0:9:8,61 --> 0:9:10,61
GM and Ford, and


259
0:9:10,61 --> 0:9:12,61
Apple and


260
0:9:12,61 --> 0:9:14,61
people across the community that


261
0:9:14,61 --> 0:9:18,61
you don't always consider traditional aerospace players.


262
0:9:18,61 --> 0:9:20,61
So,


263
0:9:20,61 --> 0:9:22,61
little bit of a snapshot as to what


264
0:9:22,61 --> 0:9:24,61
and why.  I think all too often


265
0:9:24,61 --> 0:9:26,61
we throw out, hey, multi-destinations.


266
0:9:26,61 --> 0:9:28,61
We've got high Earth orbit, geosynchronous orbit,


267
0:9:28,61 --> 0:9:30,61
Lagrange points.  Why?


268
0:9:30,61 --> 0:9:32,61
What's compelling about them?  Well, essentially,


269
0:9:32,61 --> 0:9:34,61
we've got a lot of opportunities for


270
0:9:34,61 --> 0:9:36,61
assembly or repair.  They're an excellent


271
0:9:36,61 --> 0:9:38,61
location for, uh,


272
0:9:38,61 --> 0:9:40,61
space, or, uh, telescopes


273
0:9:40,61 --> 0:9:42,61
large, uh, larger


274
0:9:42,61 --> 0:9:44,61
uh, large aperture telescopes.


275
0:9:44,61 --> 0:9:46,61
Looking at Mars and its moons,


276
0:9:46,61 --> 0:9:48,61
essentially, perhaps a horizon


277
0:9:48,61 --> 0:9:50,61
destination for humans


278
0:9:50,61 --> 0:9:52,61
at least in the relatively near term.


279
0:9:52,61 --> 0:9:54,61
You know, is there a life beyond Earth?


280
0:9:54,61 --> 0:9:56,61
You know, how did it evolve?


281
0:9:56,61 --> 0:9:58,61
And, I think from there, uh,


282
0:9:58,61 --> 0:10:0,61
it holds a special place


283
0:10:0,61 --> 0:10:2,61
in many peoples, uh, many peoples


284
0:10:2,61 --> 0:10:4,61
psyche.  Likewise, the moon,


285
0:10:4,61 --> 0:10:6,61
uh, our nearest


286
0:10:6,61 --> 0:10:8,61
uh, our nearest, celestial


287
0:10:8,61 --> 0:10:10,61
body there, we can see a lot


288
0:10:10,61 --> 0:10:12,61
that is covered up by the, uh,


289
0:10:12,61 --> 0:10:14,61
by the environmental impacts here


290
0:10:14,61 --> 0:10:16,61
on the Earth.  It's a great historical


291
0:10:16,61 --> 0:10:18,61
record, uh, with the


292
0:10:18,61 --> 0:10:20,61
rich discoveries of water,


293
0:10:20,61 --> 0:10:22,61
and uh, and all the near-term


294
0:10:22,61 --> 0:10:24,61
other exciting discoveries that we've


295
0:10:24,61 --> 0:10:26,61
just begun to unravel with the Moon.


296
0:10:26,61 --> 0:10:28,61
Um, we OK?


297
0:10:28,61 --> 0:10:30,61
OK, uh, I think,


298
0:10:30,61 --> 0:10:32,61
that, uh, I think given the fact that


299
0:10:32,61 --> 0:10:34,61
it's just three days away as well


300
0:10:34,61 --> 0:10:36,61
holds huge potential


301
0:10:36,61 --> 0:10:38,61
commercial, uh, promise.


302
0:10:38,61 --> 0:10:40,61
And, uh, as we look at Near Earth Asteroids,


303
0:10:40,61 --> 0:10:42,61
NEAs, um,


304
0:10:42,61 --> 0:10:44,61
we have some compelling science


305
0:10:44,61 --> 0:10:46,61
questions.  Everything from


306
0:10:46,61 --> 0:10:48,61
how did the solar system form? 


307
0:10:48,61 --> 0:10:50,61
To, uh, helping to


308
0:10:50,61 --> 0:10:52,61
gain some insight into planetary defense.


309
0:10:52,61 --> 0:10:54,61
We know that, uh,


310
0:10:54,61 --> 0:10:56,61
uh, throughout


311
0:10:56,61 --> 0:10:58,61
history, uh, Earth has


312
0:10:58,61 --> 0:11:0,61
uh, the planet Earth has seen some, uh,


313
0:11:0,61 --> 0:11:2,61
seen some impacts


314
0:11:2,61 --> 0:11:4,61
so, as we seek to better understand


315
0:11:4,61 --> 0:11:6,61
what we can do to, uh


316
0:11:6,61 --> 0:11:8,61
both potentially mitigate that or


317
0:11:8,61 --> 0:11:10,61
understand the dynamic, I think all of


318
0:11:10,61 --> 0:11:12,61
that is relevant.  So, that kind of


319
0:11:12,61 --> 0:11:14,61
gives you a little snapshot there.  This is kind of


320
0:11:14,61 --> 0:11:16,61
a picture of how it all weaves together.


321
0:11:16,61 --> 0:11:18,61
Here we are at the international space station down at the bottom,


322
0:11:18,61 --> 0:11:20,61
looking at our new, uh, our new


323
0:11:20,61 --> 0:11:22,61
low Earth orbit missions and as we


324
0:11:22,61 --> 0:11:24,61
extend out in kind of a crescendo of


325
0:11:24,61 --> 0:11:26,61
capabilities.  This is really what a


326
0:11:26,61 --> 0:11:28,61
capability driven, uh, framework or


327
0:11:28,61 --> 0:11:30,61
capability driven exploration


328
0:11:30,61 --> 0:11:32,61
is about.  It's about building the


329
0:11:32,61 --> 0:11:34,61
capabilities and the technologies such


330
0:11:34,61 --> 0:11:36,61
that you can go beyond in an iterative,


331
0:11:36,61 --> 0:11:38,61
or, stepwise fashion, and you


332
0:11:38,61 --> 0:11:40,61
don't have a single path.


333
0:11:40,61 --> 0:11:42,61
So, we have, uh, we can leverage


334
0:11:42,61 --> 0:11:44,61
uh, the, uh,


335
0:11:44,61 --> 0:11:46,61
GEO/HEO Missions, looking at lunar flybys,


336
0:11:46,61 --> 0:11:48,61
lunar surface, uh,


337
0:11:48,61 --> 0:11:50,61
"Min," and "Full Capability" Near-Earth Asteroids,


338
0:11:50,61 --> 0:11:52,61
Phobos/Deimos, and Mars.


339
0:11:52,61 --> 0:11:54,61
And, you see along the way,


340
0:11:54,61 --> 0:11:56,61
what, uh, what each, uh,


341
0:11:56,61 --> 0:11:58,61
what each new plateau affords.


342
0:11:58,61 --> 0:12:0,61
As, uh, keeping


343
0:12:0,61 --> 0:12:2,61
consistent with kind of the quick overview,


344
0:12:2,61 --> 0:12:4,61
I wanted to provide you some insight into,


345
0:12:4,61 --> 0:12:6,61
we call these "budget themes."


346
0:12:6,61 --> 0:12:8,61
When we go up and brief Congress,


347
0:12:8,61 --> 0:12:10,61
uh, with the President's budget, we


348
0:12:10,61 --> 0:12:12,61
talk in each of these theme areas.


349
0:12:12,61 --> 0:12:14,61
And, so that's why it's going to perfectly dovetail with


350
0:12:14,61 --> 0:12:16,61
uh, what Garry and Maria


351
0:12:16,61 --> 0:12:18,61
are gonna talk about.


352
0:12:18,61 --> 0:12:20,61
Essentially, we've got, uh, this theme


353
0:12:20,61 --> 0:12:22,61
The Human Exploration Capabilities budgeted


354
0:12:22,61 --> 0:12:24,61
$2.8 billion for FY12.


355
0:12:24,61 --> 0:12:26,61
Essentially, uh, that


356
0:12:26,61 --> 0:12:28,61
does include labor, and uh, essentially,


357
0:12:28,61 --> 0:12:30,61
that includes $1.8 billion


358
0:12:30,61 --> 0:12:32,61
for the Space Launch System


359
0:12:32,61 --> 0:12:34,61
and, uh, roughly a billion dollars for


360
0:12:34,61 --> 0:12:36,61
the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, and


361
0:12:36,61 --> 0:12:38,61
the ground ops, uh, kind of


362
0:12:38,61 --> 0:12:40,61
an amalgam between ground ops and


363
0:12:40,61 --> 0:12:42,61
21st Century, that enables that.


364
0:12:42,61 --> 0:12:44,61
So, that gives you a little snapshot there.


365
0:12:44,61 --> 0:12:46,61
Uh, right now, as we


366
0:12:46,61 --> 0:12:48,61
uh, and Garry,


367
0:12:48,61 --> 0:12:50,61
I won't spend hardly any time on this


368
0:12:50,61 --> 0:12:52,61
uh, because he will do an awesome job


369
0:12:52,61 --> 0:12:54,61
at it, and I mean awesome,


370
0:12:54,61 --> 0:12:56,61
cause he is incredibly thorough.


371
0:12:56,61 --> 0:12:58,61
Um, as we look at a Reference Vehicle


372
0:12:58,61 --> 0:13:0,61
Design that we communicated


373
0:13:0,61 --> 0:13:2,61
in our early, our early chats,


374
0:13:2,61 --> 0:13:4,61
it was 100


375
0:13:4,61 --> 0:13:6,61
metric ton, or pardon me a


376
0:13:6,61 --> 0:13:8,61
70 to 100 metric ton evolvable to


377
0:13:8,61 --> 0:13:10,61
130 metric ton launch


378
0:13:10,61 --> 0:13:12,61
vehicle.  Built and derived from


379
0:13:12,61 --> 0:13:14,61
the Ares and Shuttle hardware,


380
0:13:14,61 --> 0:13:16,61
with the capability to lift the


381
0:13:16,61 --> 0:13:18,61
Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle.  So, you see


382
0:13:18,61 --> 0:13:20,61
essentially, what the Reference


383
0:13:20,61 --> 0:13:22,61
Vehicle Design was,


384
0:13:22,61 --> 0:13:24,61
as we submitted.


385
0:13:24,61 --> 0:13:26,61
But, we've got, uh, we've had, uh


386
0:13:26,61 --> 0:13:28,61
a huge amount of work that's gone on since then.


387
0:13:28,61 --> 0:13:30,61
Next slide, uh, is


388
0:13:30,61 --> 0:13:32,61
looking at the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle.


389
0:13:32,61 --> 0:13:34,61
Again, we're looking


390
0:13:34,61 --> 0:13:36,61
beyond low Earth orbit,


391
0:13:36,61 --> 0:13:38,61
a variant of the Orion, essentially the


392
0:13:38,61 --> 0:13:40,61
block 2, for those of you that were familiar with it.


393
0:13:40,61 --> 0:13:42,61
And, essentially, this is looking at a


394
0:13:42,61 --> 0:13:44,61
requirements-based, or requirements-driven approach.


395
0:13:44,61 --> 0:13:46,61
Uh, and we're making some final decisions


396
0:13:46,61 --> 0:13:48,61
uh, this summer, we're going to


397
0:13:48,61 --> 0:13:50,61
be communicating that to Congress in what we


398
0:13:50,61 --> 0:13:52,61
call the 90-day report.


399
0:13:52,61 --> 0:13:54,61
And, uh, we'll be building that into the budget,


400
0:13:54,61 --> 0:13:56,61
budget activities and


401
0:13:56,61 --> 0:13:58,61
also the programmatic implementation.


402
0:13:58,61 --> 0:14:0,61
On the commercial side, and


403
0:14:0,61 --> 0:14:2,61
this is a beautiful, this is a beautiful kind of


404
0:14:2,61 --> 0:14:4,61
image showing, uh


405
0:14:4,61 --> 0:14:6,61
a whole bunch, or a


406
0:14:6,61 --> 0:14:8,61
a whole host of potential applications


407
0:14:8,61 --> 0:14:10,61
but, we've got about


408
0:14:10,61 --> 0:14:12,61
$850 million


409
0:14:12,61 --> 0:14:14,61
slated in FY12,


410
0:14:14,61 --> 0:14:16,61
and that includes the labor.


411
0:14:16,61 --> 0:14:18,61
Providing not only,


412
0:14:18,61 --> 0:14:20,61
looking for safer and reliable transportation


413
0:14:20,61 --> 0:14:22,61
to the, uh, and affordable


414
0:14:22,61 --> 0:14:24,61
commercial systems for both


415
0:14:24,61 --> 0:14:26,61
cargo first, and then crew to


416
0:14:26,61 --> 0:14:28,61
the international space station


417
0:14:28,61 --> 0:14:30,61
and low Earth orbit.  We are


418
0:14:30,61 --> 0:14:32,61
transitioning, um


419
0:14:32,61 --> 0:14:34,61
from, we're completing


420
0:14:34,61 --> 0:14:36,61
some of our milestones or our


421
0:14:36,61 --> 0:14:38,61
capability milestones based out


422
0:14:38,61 --> 0:14:40,61
to, uh, to uh, starting to


423
0:14:40,61 --> 0:14:42,61
generate, uh, to generate


424
0:14:42,61 --> 0:14:44,61
a broader industry capable


425
0:14:44,61 --> 0:14:46,61
of supporting the, uh, the crew


426
0:14:46,61 --> 0:14:48,61
uh, the crew needs and


427
0:14:48,61 --> 0:14:50,61
the transportation, traffic flow


428
0:14:50,61 --> 0:14:52,61
challenges of the international


429
0:14:52,61 --> 0:14:54,61
space station.  So, Maria


430
0:14:54,61 --> 0:14:56,61
will do yeoman's work


431
0:14:56,61 --> 0:14:58,61
in outlining that. Uh, as we look at


432
0:14:58,61 --> 0:15:0,61
exploration, research and development


433
0:15:0,61 --> 0:15:2,61
theme, essentially


434
0:15:2,61 --> 0:15:4,61
we've got, uh, we've got


435
0:15:4,61 --> 0:15:6,61
just under $300 million going to this.


436
0:15:6,61 --> 0:15:8,61
It includes the Human Research Program, as well


437
0:15:8,61 --> 0:15:10,61
as our Advanced Exploration Systems.


438
0:15:10,61 --> 0:15:12,61
And, those are, uh, those


439
0:15:12,61 --> 0:15:14,61
are some of our what we call "skunk works,"


440
0:15:14,61 --> 0:15:16,61
or lean or rapid prototyping,


441
0:15:16,61 --> 0:15:18,61
some non-traditional


442
0:15:18,61 --> 0:15:20,61
uh, if you will type approaches


443
0:15:20,61 --> 0:15:22,61
at NASA.  We've done several


444
0:15:22,61 --> 0:15:24,61
prototypes along this line


445
0:15:24,61 --> 0:15:26,61
things like the Robonaut 2,


446
0:15:26,61 --> 0:15:28,61
uh, the hab and habex


447
0:15:28,61 --> 0:15:30,61
and, uh, what used to be called


448
0:15:30,61 --> 0:15:32,61
the Lunar Electric Rover, now the


449
0:15:32,61 --> 0:15:34,61
Space Exploration Vehicle, the SEV.


450
0:15:34,61 --> 0:15:36,61
Those are all examples of prototype


451
0:15:36,61 --> 0:15:38,61
uh, approaches that we've done


452
0:15:38,61 --> 0:15:40,61
each one is a little bit different, but all carrying that


453
0:15:40,61 --> 0:15:42,61
principle, we've got about


454
0:15:42,61 --> 0:15:44,61
63, well not not about,


455
0:15:44,61 --> 0:15:46,61
we have 63 submittals in


456
0:15:46,61 --> 0:15:48,61
as part of this year's, uh,


457
0:15:48,61 --> 0:15:50,61
effort, and those are all getting


458
0:15:50,61 --> 0:15:52,61
reviewed as we speak right now.


459
0:15:52,61 --> 0:15:54,61
Um,


460
0:15:54,61 --> 0:15:56,61
as we look at, uh, with


461
0:15:56,61 --> 0:15:58,61
the Office of the Chief Technologist, OCT,


462
0:15:58,61 --> 0:16:0,61
Dr. Bobby Braun, we are


463
0:16:0,61 --> 0:16:2,61
sending what used to be the majority


464
0:16:2,61 --> 0:16:4,61
of our exploration technology development


465
0:16:4,61 --> 0:16:6,61
program.  We're sending that over to


466
0:16:6,61 --> 0:16:8,61
the Office of the Chief Technologist to


467
0:16:8,61 --> 0:16:10,61
to, uh, to do that work as part of a broader


468
0:16:10,61 --> 0:16:12,61
agency portfolio that will


469
0:16:12,61 --> 0:16:14,61
still remain critically important


470
0:16:14,61 --> 0:16:16,61
as those are mission enabling


471
0:16:16,61 --> 0:16:18,61
and mission critical for


472
0:16:18,61 --> 0:16:20,61
our exploration missions.


473
0:16:20,61 --> 0:16:22,61
Uh, and, for


474
0:16:22,61 --> 0:16:24,61
'12, we're taking a little breather


475
0:16:24,61 --> 0:16:26,61
on, uh, on the uh


476
0:16:26,61 --> 0:16:28,61
Exploration Precursor Robotics


477
0:16:28,61 --> 0:16:30,61
activities, but then in '13


478
0:16:30,61 --> 0:16:32,61
we have a, uh


479
0:16:32,61 --> 0:16:34,61
a blended funding line between exploration


480
0:16:34,61 --> 0:16:36,61
and Science Mission Directorate


481
0:16:36,61 --> 0:16:38,61
for, uh, for those in the


482
0:16:38,61 --> 0:16:40,61
sum of $30 million.


483
0:16:40,61 --> 0:16:42,61
Um,


484
0:16:42,61 --> 0:16:44,61
This just gives you a little bit more,


485
0:16:44,61 --> 0:16:46,61
we already talked about


486
0:16:46,61 --> 0:16:48,61
a risk-based approach to the international


487
0:16:48,61 --> 0:16:50,61
space station, leveraging


488
0:16:50,61 --> 0:16:52,61
what we can there, but also


489
0:16:52,61 --> 0:16:54,61
the ultimate goal is to have much


490
0:16:54,61 --> 0:16:56,61
longer, outside the


491
0:16:56,61 --> 0:16:58,61
Van Allen radiation belt capabilities,


492
0:16:58,61 --> 0:17:0,61
so that we can do these extended


493
0:17:0,61 --> 0:17:2,61
mission durations of perhaps


494
0:17:2,61 --> 0:17:4,61
a year or more.  So, that's a critical driver


495
0:17:4,61 --> 0:17:6,61
and, uh,


496
0:17:6,61 --> 0:17:8,61
the people part of it are


497
0:17:8,61 --> 0:17:10,61
truly a daunting challenge,


498
0:17:10,61 --> 0:17:12,61
but also a huge opportunity.


499
0:17:12,61 --> 0:17:14,61
Uh,


500
0:17:14,61 --> 0:17:16,61
looking a little bit at how we're shaping


501
0:17:16,61 --> 0:17:18,61
that up, ISS utilization.


502
0:17:18,61 --> 0:17:20,61
Developing space biomedical capabilities,


503
0:17:20,61 --> 0:17:22,61
looking at, we talked about radiation


504
0:17:22,61 --> 0:17:24,61
safety for the crew, and then


505
0:17:24,61 --> 0:17:26,61
uh, very much akin with, uh,


506
0:17:26,61 --> 0:17:28,61
with, uh the national


507
0:17:28,61 --> 0:17:30,61
engagement,


508
0:17:30,61 --> 0:17:32,61
harnessing the collective brain power


509
0:17:32,61 --> 0:17:34,61
of not only our national research community,


510
0:17:34,61 --> 0:17:36,61
but a very robust and


511
0:17:36,61 --> 0:17:38,61
integrated international space research


512
0:17:38,61 --> 0:17:40,61
community.  One that is


513
0:17:40,61 --> 0:17:42,61
leveraging not only traditional partners,


514
0:17:42,61 --> 0:17:44,61
but, personally, we, uh,


515
0:17:44,61 --> 0:17:46,61
we've done a lot more with


516
0:17:46,61 --> 0:17:48,61
Korea and other countries like that.


517
0:17:48,61 --> 0:17:50,61
Smaller, burgeoning, uh,


518
0:17:50,61 --> 0:17:52,61
blossoming, uh


519
0:17:52,61 --> 0:17:54,61
space agencies. So, we're


520
0:17:54,61 --> 0:17:56,61
looking to leverage and enhance those kind of


521
0:17:56,61 --> 0:17:58,61
uh, partnerships.


522
0:17:58,61 --> 0:18:0,61
And, uh, looking a little bit at


523
0:18:0,61 --> 0:18:2,61
Advanced Exploration Program review, we already


524
0:18:2,61 --> 0:18:4,61
talked some of that


525
0:18:4,61 --> 0:18:6,61
this is the Robonaut 2, depicted in


526
0:18:6,61 --> 0:18:8,61
the middle there.  Essentially,


527
0:18:8,61 --> 0:18:10,61
we're looking to engage our


528
0:18:10,61 --> 0:18:12,61
great, our great


529
0:18:12,61 --> 0:18:14,61
and experienced workforce, and do more hands on


530
0:18:14,61 --> 0:18:16,61
work here.  Uh, smaller


531
0:18:16,61 --> 0:18:18,61
procurement dollar,


532
0:18:18,61 --> 0:18:20,61
more intense civil servant


533
0:18:20,61 --> 0:18:22,61
leveraged approach.


534
0:18:22,61 --> 0:18:24,61
Um, we are looking


535
0:18:24,61 --> 0:18:26,61
to ensure that we reduce


536
0:18:26,61 --> 0:18:28,61
risk, lower our life cycle costs,


537
0:18:28,61 --> 0:18:30,61
and validate some of the unique con ops.


538
0:18:30,61 --> 0:18:32,61
So this is where we're allowed to take a little bit more risk.


539
0:18:32,61 --> 0:18:34,61
We're allowed to


540
0:18:34,61 --> 0:18:36,61
have some smart failures, as long as


541
0:18:36,61 --> 0:18:38,61
we're learning from these, and, uh,


542
0:18:38,61 --> 0:18:40,61
I think this is a strong step in the right direction.


543
0:18:40,61 --> 0:18:42,61
And, changing the


544
0:18:42,61 --> 0:18:44,61
paradigm, making us more agile and


545
0:18:44,61 --> 0:18:46,61
more responsive, but most importantly


546
0:18:46,61 --> 0:18:48,61
dealing with the critical need that we're going to have


547
0:18:48,61 --> 0:18:50,61
from these systems in this, uh, in this


548
0:18:50,61 --> 0:18:52,61
increasingly, uh,


549
0:18:52,61 --> 0:18:54,61
challenging, uh, budgetary environment.


550
0:18:54,61 --> 0:18:58,61
This is a doable solution.


551
0:18:58,61 --> 0:19:0,61
Alright, we already talked a little bit about


552
0:19:0,61 --> 0:19:2,61
that, I won't spend too much more on that.


553
0:19:2,61 --> 0:19:4,61
We are using analogs in a


554
0:19:4,61 --> 0:19:6,61
large way.  We're using ground tests,


555
0:19:6,61 --> 0:19:8,61
flight tests, uh, we're using


556
0:19:8,61 --> 0:19:10,61
final DTOs aboard the space


557
0:19:10,61 --> 0:19:12,61
uh, space shuttle and also the


558
0:19:12,61 --> 0:19:14,61
space station.  So,


559
0:19:14,61 --> 0:19:16,61
that's kind of the scene setter,


560
0:19:16,61 --> 0:19:18,61
What I'd like to give you now is a quick


561
0:19:18,61 --> 0:19:20,61
snapshot into


562
0:19:20,61 --> 0:19:22,61
our human exploration framework team,


563
0:19:22,61 --> 0:19:24,61
talk about some of the context there.


564
0:19:24,61 --> 0:19:26,61
So essentially,


565
0:19:26,61 --> 0:19:28,61
I think


566
0:19:28,61 --> 0:19:30,61
over the past couple of days, you've seen


567
0:19:30,61 --> 0:19:32,61
just how profound and complex


568
0:19:32,61 --> 0:19:34,61
and challenging and how


569
0:19:34,61 --> 0:19:36,61
team oriented


570
0:19:36,61 --> 0:19:38,61
uh,


571
0:19:38,61 --> 0:19:40,61
truly bold, human


572
0:19:40,61 --> 0:19:42,61
space flight systems


573
0:19:42,61 --> 0:19:44,61
developments and operations are.


574
0:19:44,61 --> 0:19:46,61
They transcend political cycles,


575
0:19:46,61 --> 0:19:48,61
they transcend generations,


576
0:19:48,61 --> 0:19:50,61
and yet,


577
0:19:50,61 --> 0:19:52,61
we've had 24 teams since '69 who have


578
0:19:52,61 --> 0:19:54,61
studied and done blue ribbon studies.


579
0:19:54,61 --> 0:19:56,61
And yet,


580
0:19:56,61 --> 0:19:58,61
when we kicked off this, our


581
0:19:58,61 --> 0:20:0,61
charter had


582
0:20:0,61 --> 0:20:2,61
six words that were different from the


583
0:20:2,61 --> 0:20:4,61
1989 90-day study.


584
0:20:4,61 --> 0:20:6,61
And one might go,


585
0:20:6,61 --> 0:20:8,61
"Well, are we just doing infinite Do loops


586
0:20:8,61 --> 0:20:10,61
on studies?"  The answer is no.


587
0:20:10,61 --> 0:20:12,61
We were guided by a lot of the, uh,


588
0:20:12,61 --> 0:20:14,61
a lot of the policy and legislation


589
0:20:14,61 --> 0:20:16,61
of the day, but the whole purpose


590
0:20:16,61 --> 0:20:18,61
is to create an integrated human space flight


591
0:20:18,61 --> 0:20:20,61
architecture that really


592
0:20:20,61 --> 0:20:22,61
helped us make smart decisions. Not only


593
0:20:22,61 --> 0:20:24,61
as an agency, but as a country


594
0:20:24,61 --> 0:20:26,61
and as a global community


595
0:20:26,61 --> 0:20:28,61
uh, to, uh inform our


596
0:20:28,61 --> 0:20:30,61
strategy and so that's what I'm going to tell you about.


597
0:20:30,61 --> 0:20:32,61
Share a little about that.


598
0:20:32,61 --> 0:20:34,61
Context -- I think you have to


599
0:20:34,61 --> 0:20:36,61
have a context in the political


600
0:20:36,61 --> 0:20:38,61
sense.  We had the Augustine Committee in '09,


601
0:20:38,61 --> 0:20:40,61
In '10 we had the National Space Policy,


602
0:20:40,61 --> 0:20:42,61
very directive toward


603
0:20:42,61 --> 0:20:44,61
international partnerships, US industrial


604
0:20:44,61 --> 0:20:46,61
base, inter-agency collaboration


605
0:20:46,61 --> 0:20:48,61
and cooperation, commercial


606
0:20:48,61 --> 0:20:50,61
engagement.  As we look


607
0:20:50,61 --> 0:20:52,61
at the Human Exploration Framework Team,


608
0:20:52,61 --> 0:20:54,61
we did, uh, we did two different


609
0:20:54,61 --> 0:20:56,61
groups or two different phases of that.


610
0:20:56,61 --> 0:20:58,61
Along, uh,


611
0:20:58,61 --> 0:21:0,61
during, right in smack dab of the middle


612
0:21:0,61 --> 0:21:2,61
of the second one, we had the NASA Authorization Act,


613
0:21:2,61 --> 0:21:4,61
that was passed.  And, you know


614
0:21:4,61 --> 0:21:6,61
it states that the long term goal is to expand


615
0:21:6,61 --> 0:21:8,61
human presence, permanent human presence


616
0:21:8,61 --> 0:21:10,61
beyond low Earth orbit, and to do so


617
0:21:10,61 --> 0:21:12,61
involving our IPs,


618
0:21:12,61 --> 0:21:14,61
our international partners, as practicable.


619
0:21:14,61 --> 0:21:16,61
Along there, we also have this


620
0:21:16,61 --> 0:21:18,61
ongoing effort, but we also now have


621
0:21:18,61 --> 0:21:20,61
a continuing resolution


622
0:21:20,61 --> 0:21:22,61
that we just got passed,


623
0:21:22,61 --> 0:21:24,61
uh, for FY11.


624
0:21:24,61 --> 0:21:26,61
So, essentially, this body


625
0:21:26,61 --> 0:21:28,61
I think people, I think people


626
0:21:28,61 --> 0:21:30,61
thought that we had the ability to


627
0:21:30,61 --> 0:21:32,61
or were setting the


628
0:21:32,61 --> 0:21:34,61
absolute concrete plan.  No, essentially


629
0:21:34,61 --> 0:21:36,61
what we were doing is


630
0:21:36,61 --> 0:21:38,61
doing the work to cue it up so that the


631
0:21:38,61 --> 0:21:40,61
agency, so that the Congress,


632
0:21:40,61 --> 0:21:42,61
so that the White House, can


633
0:21:42,61 --> 0:21:44,61
have informed, uh,


634
0:21:44,61 --> 0:21:46,61
informed set ups, and we can


635
0:21:46,61 --> 0:21:48,61
make those smart decisions


636
0:21:48,61 --> 0:21:50,61
in a timely fashion.  And, I think


637
0:21:50,61 --> 0:21:52,61
the number one thing that people


638
0:21:52,61 --> 0:21:54,61
are looking at is, "Hey, what is our


639
0:21:54,61 --> 0:21:56,61
path, and let's all


640
0:21:56,61 --> 0:21:58,61
get on board and start executing


641
0:21:58,61 --> 0:22:0,61
that, because we are truly at a critical


642
0:22:0,61 --> 0:22:2,61
time in history."  So,


643
0:22:2,61 --> 0:22:4,61
um, a little bit of guidance.


644
0:22:4,61 --> 0:22:6,61
This is a huge word chart.


645
0:22:6,61 --> 0:22:8,61
Many of these are so vetted,


646
0:22:8,61 --> 0:22:10,61
so scrubbed, by


647
0:22:10,61 --> 0:22:12,61
folks that it's just not even worth trying to


648
0:22:12,61 --> 0:22:14,61
change them. I'll just hit the highlights


649
0:22:14,61 --> 0:22:16,61
Essentially, affrodability has gotta be a huge driver


650
0:22:16,61 --> 0:22:18,61
Second one, I think


651
0:22:18,61 --> 0:22:20,61
many, especially in the younger generation


652
0:22:20,61 --> 0:22:22,61
here, will resonate with the second one.


653
0:22:22,61 --> 0:22:24,61
We gotta reward value


654
0:22:24,61 --> 0:22:26,61
conscious performance, take prudent risk


655
0:22:26,61 --> 0:22:28,61
assumption, look at bold innovation,


656
0:22:28,61 --> 0:22:30,61
harness the can-do attitude.


657
0:22:30,61 --> 0:22:32,61
We've, we're an agency 


658
0:22:32,61 --> 0:22:34,61
of can-do and we need


659
0:22:34,61 --> 0:22:36,61
to continue and build upon that and evolve.


660
0:22:36,61 --> 0:22:38,61
Um, this,


661
0:22:38,61 --> 0:22:40,61
this stems all the way from


662
0:22:40,61 --> 0:22:42,61
the very newest


663
0:22:42,61 --> 0:22:44,61
ranks, our 10-week, uh,


664
0:22:44,61 --> 0:22:46,61
our 10-week people, all the way


665
0:22:46,61 --> 0:22:48,61
to our, our senior


666
0:22:48,61 --> 0:22:50,61
executives, all the way to


667
0:22:50,61 --> 0:22:52,61
the administrator and the associate administrators


668
0:22:52,61 --> 0:22:54,61
taking that bull by the horns.


669
0:22:54,61 --> 0:22:56,61
And, we need to build and


670
0:22:56,61 --> 0:22:58,61
apply on everything that we've learned over


671
0:22:58,61 --> 0:23:0,61
the past 53 plus years of human space


672
0:23:0,61 --> 0:23:2,61
flight experience,


673
0:23:2,61 --> 0:23:4,61
yet still seek out new innovative ways.


674
0:23:4,61 --> 0:23:6,61
So, marry the best


675
0:23:6,61 --> 0:23:8,61
of both and then leverage our


676
0:23:8,61 --> 0:23:10,61
assets and our people appropriately.


677
0:23:10,61 --> 0:23:12,61
But, that doesn't mean


678
0:23:12,61 --> 0:23:14,61
that we keep everything, because


679
0:23:14,61 --> 0:23:16,61
we have a huge


680
0:23:16,61 --> 0:23:18,61
resource burden, and we need to be


681
0:23:18,61 --> 0:23:20,61
smart and have that requirements driven.


682
0:23:20,61 --> 0:23:22,61
So, here's, here's a couple of


683
0:23:22,61 --> 0:23:24,61
the principles.


684
0:23:24,61 --> 0:23:26,61
Do a routine cadence, and do a routine cadence at


685
0:23:26,61 --> 0:23:28,61
first.  So have it, keep it


686
0:23:28,61 --> 0:23:30,61
sold, if you will.  Have it be a


687
0:23:30,61 --> 0:23:32,61
regular set.  Build upon those


688
0:23:32,61 --> 0:23:34,61
capabilities, we already talked about that.


689
0:23:34,61 --> 0:23:36,61
It's gotta fit within the budget.


690
0:23:36,61 --> 0:23:38,61
That's almost like a "duh."  We can't


691
0:23:38,61 --> 0:23:40,61
be, uh, we can't developing


692
0:23:40,61 --> 0:23:42,61
plans that aren't


693
0:23:42,61 --> 0:23:44,61
executable, given the fiscal constraints that we have.


694
0:23:44,61 --> 0:23:46,61
And, it's not gonna get that much better.


695
0:23:46,61 --> 0:23:48,61
But, that doesn't mean, I mean


696
0:23:48,61 --> 0:23:50,61
we still got, uh,


697
0:23:50,61 --> 0:23:52,61
$18.485 billion,


698
0:23:52,61 --> 0:23:54,61
um, going for us.


699
0:23:54,61 --> 0:23:56,61
We can do a heck of a lot


700
0:23:56,61 --> 0:23:58,61
for that. We've got to leverage


701
0:23:58,61 --> 0:24:0,61
the international space station, we've got a $100 billion


702
0:24:0,61 --> 0:24:2,61
asset.  Just the prudent, right thing to do


703
0:24:2,61 --> 0:24:4,61
and we can use it as a stepping stone with our


704
0:24:4,61 --> 0:24:6,61
international partners as well.


705
0:24:6,61 --> 0:24:8,61
We gotta have a balance here between execution


706
0:24:8,61 --> 0:24:10,61
and technology development,


707
0:24:10,61 --> 0:24:12,61
leverage commonality and evolutionary approach.


708
0:24:12,61 --> 0:24:14,61
Uh, we gotta, you know,


709
0:24:14,61 --> 0:24:16,61
this fight between humans and robots,


710
0:24:16,61 --> 0:24:18,61
that's, that's, that's


711
0:24:18,61 --> 0:24:20,61
that's a fallacy, we gotta have both


712
0:24:20,61 --> 0:24:22,61
and optimize the best.


713
0:24:22,61 --> 0:24:24,61
And then, uh, we gotta leverage


714
0:24:24,61 --> 0:24:26,61
our non-NASA capabilities, whether


715
0:24:26,61 --> 0:24:28,61
they be the DOD or the Department of Energy


716
0:24:28,61 --> 0:24:30,61
or academia, or industry.


717
0:24:30,61 --> 0:24:32,61
And, we gotta stop


718
0:24:32,61 --> 0:24:34,61
having NASA unique


719
0:24:34,61 --> 0:24:36,61
supply chains and new facilities


720
0:24:36,61 --> 0:24:38,61
such that, we


721
0:24:38,61 --> 0:24:40,61
carry the burden of those solely.


722
0:24:40,61 --> 0:24:42,61
So we need to look


723
0:24:42,61 --> 0:24:44,61
in a smart sense there.  And then, develop


724
0:24:44,61 --> 0:24:46,61
the best practices, wherever


725
0:24:46,61 --> 0:24:48,61
uh, we see those.   Uh, truly to be


726
0:24:48,61 --> 0:24:50,61
world-class, you gotta be, uh,


727
0:24:50,61 --> 0:24:52,61
you gotta be a world-class adopter.


728
0:24:52,61 --> 0:24:54,61
So, HEFT, essentially,


729
0:24:54,61 --> 0:24:56,61
we got together, we did a


730
0:24:56,61 --> 0:24:58,61
we, uh, we established a framework


731
0:24:58,61 --> 0:25:0,61
uh, it's called the


732
0:25:0,61 --> 0:25:2,61
capability-driven framework.


733
0:25:2,61 --> 0:25:4,61
And essentially, it's all geared to do one thing:


734
0:25:4,61 --> 0:25:6,61
to weather the political and economic


735
0:25:6,61 --> 0:25:8,61
dynamics and to actually achieve


736
0:25:8,61 --> 0:25:10,61
a cohesive, long term


737
0:25:10,61 --> 0:25:12,61
multi-destination, integrated


738
0:25:12,61 --> 0:25:14,61
approach to human space flight.


739
0:25:14,61 --> 0:25:16,61
And, so I think


740
0:25:16,61 --> 0:25:18,61
we'll explain how we believe that this does


741
0:25:18,61 --> 0:25:20,61
create a safe, affordable and sustainable


742
0:25:20,61 --> 0:25:22,61
approach to that.


743
0:25:22,61 --> 0:25:24,61
It was hugely iterative, we did


744
0:25:24,61 --> 0:25:26,61
lots of technical design and reference missions,


745
0:25:26,61 --> 0:25:28,61
you cross those with investment strategies


746
0:25:28,61 --> 0:25:30,61
it shows the options.  It's not


747
0:25:30,61 --> 0:25:32,61
just one single path.  Somebody mentioned,


748
0:25:32,61 --> 0:25:34,61
you know, "Could we have multiple paths


749
0:25:34,61 --> 0:25:36,61
and maybe all are viable?"  Well that's absolutely true


750
0:25:36,61 --> 0:25:38,61
here.  And, as we look at that,


751
0:25:38,61 --> 0:25:40,61
we developed, "What do you need to go do those?"


752
0:25:40,61 --> 0:25:42,61
Those element catalogs are


753
0:25:42,61 --> 0:25:44,61
the resultant of that.  Then we looked


754
0:25:44,61 --> 0:25:46,61
at the cost and the schedule to


755
0:25:46,61 --> 0:25:48,61
develop each of those, both the development,


756
0:25:48,61 --> 0:25:50,61
the fixed and the recurring, the production


757
0:25:50,61 --> 0:25:52,61
and operations, looked at the phasing.


758
0:25:52,61 --> 0:25:54,61
And, really, ultimately,


759
0:25:54,61 --> 0:25:56,61
that yielded an integrated


760
0:25:56,61 --> 0:25:58,61
program schedule and flight manifest.


761
0:25:58,61 --> 0:26:0,61
Was it ever right the first time?


762
0:26:0,61 --> 0:26:2,61
Absolutely not.  Why?


763
0:26:2,61 --> 0:26:4,61
Because it needs to be optimized


764
0:26:4,61 --> 0:26:6,61
and iterated.  And when we usually saw


765
0:26:6,61 --> 0:26:8,61
that budgets spit out, the raw 


766
0:26:8,61 --> 0:26:10,61
budget numbers in terms of a sand chart,


767
0:26:10,61 --> 0:26:12,61
it didn't all fit in the box.  So that's why


768
0:26:12,61 --> 0:26:14,61
I say up at the top, it was highly iterative.


769
0:26:14,61 --> 0:26:16,61
Yet, from this,


770
0:26:16,61 --> 0:26:18,61
we distilled out, hey, what are our


771
0:26:18,61 --> 0:26:20,61
key technology priorities?  What are our key


772
0:26:20,61 --> 0:26:22,61
stakeholder concerns?  How did we meet those?


773
0:26:22,61 --> 0:26:24,61
And we, you know, we checked our homework


774
0:26:24,61 --> 0:26:26,61
along the way.


775
0:26:26,61 --> 0:26:28,61
So, this capability-driven framework


776
0:26:28,61 --> 0:26:30,61
that resulted out this is,


777
0:26:30,61 --> 0:26:32,61
it said, "Hey, we're going to use these common elements


778
0:26:32,61 --> 0:26:34,61
these things that we developed, we're not gonna just


779
0:26:34,61 --> 0:26:36,61
go one destination and


780
0:26:36,61 --> 0:26:38,61
and have the stuff not be applicable


781
0:26:38,61 --> 0:26:40,61
or, or, have it be a


782
0:26:40,61 --> 0:26:42,61
dead end.  No, we're gonna look at


783
0:26:42,61 --> 0:26:44,61
that across all the design reference


784
0:26:44,61 --> 0:26:46,61
missions and see where, see where


785
0:26:46,61 --> 0:26:48,61
we have commonality."  Turns out,


786
0:26:48,61 --> 0:26:50,61
as we look at the con ops, the contingencies


787
0:26:50,61 --> 0:26:52,61
and aborts are actually driving


788
0:26:52,61 --> 0:26:54,61
of the, uh, of


789
0:26:54,61 --> 0:26:56,61
many of, uh many of the


790
0:26:56,61 --> 0:26:58,61
requirements here.  So, it's not just the nominal missions,


791
0:26:58,61 --> 0:27:0,61
it's actually going to do them


792
0:27:0,61 --> 0:27:2,61
and looking at the aborts and


793
0:27:2,61 --> 0:27:4,61
contingencies as the key drivers.


794
0:27:4,61 --> 0:27:6,61
And, ultimately, we, this allows


795
0:27:6,61 --> 0:27:8,61
us to play with the


796
0:27:8,61 --> 0:27:10,61
cost and the schedule,


797
0:27:10,61 --> 0:27:12,61
phasing a bit.


798
0:27:12,61 --> 0:27:14,61
Essentially, in the past, we


799
0:27:14,61 --> 0:27:16,61
haven't had an ability to say "Hey,


800
0:27:16,61 --> 0:27:18,61
as you get increments or decrements in budget


801
0:27:18,61 --> 0:27:20,61
what does that do to you?"


802
0:27:20,61 --> 0:27:22,61
We used to have, OK you get a


803
0:27:22,61 --> 0:27:24,61
10% budget, what does that to your


804
0:27:24,61 --> 0:27:26,61
plans to go to the Moon.  Well,


805
0:27:26,61 --> 0:27:28,61
it'd bad, but how bad?


806
0:27:28,61 --> 0:27:30,61
Now, we have a prioritized list


807
0:27:30,61 --> 0:27:32,61
where we say, "Hey, as you decrement the budget,


808
0:27:32,61 --> 0:27:34,61
here's the priorities, we already


809
0:27:34,61 --> 0:27:36,61
have the list.  Here's what we won't be doing.  Is that


810
0:27:36,61 --> 0:27:38,61
acceptable from a political ramification


811
0:27:38,61 --> 0:27:40,61
or from a national end resultant?"


812
0:27:40,61 --> 0:27:42,61
Or, similarly, or conversely,


813
0:27:42,61 --> 0:27:44,61
as you, as


814
0:27:44,61 --> 0:27:46,61
you say, "I'd like to go to


815
0:27:46,61 --> 0:27:48,61
do this, or as we increment


816
0:27:48,61 --> 0:27:50,61
the budget, what's available,


817
0:27:50,61 --> 0:27:52,61
what can you do?"  We will show


818
0:27:52,61 --> 0:27:54,61
with already preset


819
0:27:54,61 --> 0:27:56,61
priorities, "Hey, here's what we'll do,


820
0:27:56,61 --> 0:27:58,61
here's what we can deliver for that."  So, it's a great


821
0:27:58,61 --> 0:28:0,61
kind of contract, uh,


822
0:28:0,61 --> 0:28:2,61
so from the financial sense


823
0:28:2,61 --> 0:28:4,61
it's a great way to have


824
0:28:4,61 --> 0:28:6,61
more ability to


825
0:28:6,61 --> 0:28:8,61
communicate exactly what you give and get.


826
0:28:8,61 --> 0:28:10,61
This is,


827
0:28:10,61 --> 0:28:12,61
this is kind of a very tough


828
0:28:12,61 --> 0:28:14,61
chart.  It shows the whole


829
0:28:14,61 --> 0:28:16,61
enchilada.  You see out there in red


830
0:28:16,61 --> 0:28:18,61
Mars missions is the ultimate horizon


831
0:28:18,61 --> 0:28:20,61
destination.  What you see is


832
0:28:20,61 --> 0:28:22,61
in blue is each of those


833
0:28:22,61 --> 0:28:24,61
candidate, uh, those candidate destinations


834
0:28:24,61 --> 0:28:26,61
in a multi-destination


835
0:28:26,61 --> 0:28:28,61
exploration approach.


836
0:28:28,61 --> 0:28:30,61
The white things are the key capabilities


837
0:28:30,61 --> 0:28:32,61
that you need to get there.


838
0:28:32,61 --> 0:28:34,61
So, in terms of Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle


839
0:28:34,61 --> 0:28:36,61
and a heavy lift launch vehicle,


840
0:28:36,61 --> 0:28:38,61
uh, needed for going beyond


841
0:28:38,61 --> 0:28:40,61
low Earth orbit.  Likewise,


842
0:28:40,61 --> 0:28:42,61
you might get the


843
0:28:42,61 --> 0:28:44,61
I'll point this out, you might get the impression


844
0:28:44,61 --> 0:28:46,61
see this crew EVA Block 2 Suit,


845
0:28:46,61 --> 0:28:48,61
you might get the impression that that's only


846
0:28:48,61 --> 0:28:50,61
applicable for the Moon because of this


847
0:28:50,61 --> 0:28:52,61
this, single way to


848
0:28:52,61 --> 0:28:54,61
look at it. So, we made another one,


849
0:28:54,61 --> 0:28:56,61
versus here as you see in purple, this


850
0:28:56,61 --> 0:28:58,61
EVA suit, that planetary


851
0:28:58,61 --> 0:29:0,61
surface suit is actually applicable to


852
0:29:0,61 --> 0:29:2,61
the Moon, Near Earth Asteroids and


853
0:29:2,61 --> 0:29:4,61
Mars as well, so you see it kind of segregates


854
0:29:4,61 --> 0:29:6,61
by transportation architecture,


855
0:29:6,61 --> 0:29:8,61
and destination architecture.


856
0:29:8,61 --> 0:29:10,61
So this gives us the flexibility to go to multiple


857
0:29:10,61 --> 0:29:12,61
places.  But, at the same time,


858
0:29:12,61 --> 0:29:14,61
I think a common criticism is


859
0:29:14,61 --> 0:29:16,61
"Well, this is a path to nowhere, is it not?


860
0:29:16,61 --> 0:29:18,61
I mean, if we don't have a single destination,


861
0:29:18,61 --> 0:29:20,61
aren't we looking at,


862
0:29:20,61 --> 0:29:22,61
at, you know,


863
0:29:22,61 --> 0:29:24,61
nothing or chaos?"


864
0:29:24,61 --> 0:29:26,61
And, that's not true at all.  Essentially,


865
0:29:26,61 --> 0:29:28,61
what we're trying to show


866
0:29:28,61 --> 0:29:30,61
is that, by investing in these


867
0:29:30,61 --> 0:29:32,61
capabilities and technologies


868
0:29:32,61 --> 0:29:34,61
we can enable multiple


869
0:29:34,61 --> 0:29:36,61
places and depending upon


870
0:29:36,61 --> 0:29:38,61
the, uh,


871
0:29:38,61 --> 0:29:40,61
political or economic or national will,


872
0:29:40,61 --> 0:29:42,61
we can go get


873
0:29:42,61 --> 0:29:44,61
uh, we can go achieve


874
0:29:44,61 --> 0:29:46,61
um, these


875
0:29:46,61 --> 0:29:48,61
mission objectives with this approach.


876
0:29:48,61 --> 0:29:50,61
Uh, notionally,


877
0:29:50,61 --> 0:29:52,61
this just gives you a snapshot of some of the architecture.


878
0:29:52,61 --> 0:29:54,61
You know, people always say,


879
0:29:54,61 --> 0:29:56,61
"You're talking fairly, uh,


880
0:29:56,61 --> 0:29:58,61
fairly high level."  These are just a snapshot--


881
0:29:58,61 --> 0:30:0,61
notional pics of some of the elements


882
0:30:0,61 --> 0:30:2,61
uh, across all the


883
0:30:2,61 --> 0:30:4,61
multi-destination approach, that uh,


884
0:30:4,61 --> 0:30:6,61
we looked at.  You see the launch vehicle, the crew vehicle,


885
0:30:6,61 --> 0:30:8,61
the cyropropulsion stage


886
0:30:8,61 --> 0:30:10,61
solar electric propulsion, a lander,


887
0:30:10,61 --> 0:30:12,61
Mars surface systems,


888
0:30:12,61 --> 0:30:14,61
the two different types of suits, launch and entry


889
0:30:14,61 --> 0:30:16,61
or planetary, uh,


890
0:30:16,61 --> 0:30:18,61
a notional depiction of a space


891
0:30:18,61 --> 0:30:20,61
exploration vehicle, uh,


892
0:30:20,61 --> 0:30:22,61
and some robotics, uh,


893
0:30:22,61 --> 0:30:24,61
and then a kick stage.


894
0:30:24,61 --> 0:30:26,61
This, uh, these charts are all public


895
0:30:26,61 --> 0:30:28,61
but what I wanted to show you, soup to nuts


896
0:30:28,61 --> 0:30:30,61
across the top, low


897
0:30:30,61 --> 0:30:32,61
Earth orbit, all the way to Mars surface.


898
0:30:32,61 --> 0:30:34,61
Kind of a crescendo of increasingly


899
0:30:34,61 --> 0:30:36,61
challenging, uh,


900
0:30:36,61 --> 0:30:38,61
destinations or capabilities.


901
0:30:38,61 --> 0:30:40,61
Down on the left


902
0:30:40,61 --> 0:30:42,61
is a range of technologies


903
0:30:42,61 --> 0:30:44,61
that are needed.  What you see is


904
0:30:44,61 --> 0:30:46,61
is white -- we pretty much non-applicable


905
0:30:46,61 --> 0:30:48,61
we don't need to do tech dev there,


906
0:30:48,61 --> 0:30:50,61
veruses in the green, we absolutely do.


907
0:30:50,61 --> 0:30:52,61
You see, that first four columns


908
0:30:52,61 --> 0:30:54,61
you got a nice, we got a nice column there


909
0:30:54,61 --> 0:30:56,61
not a lot of, not so much green,


910
0:30:56,61 --> 0:30:58,61
well, that's kind of a, that's kind of a


911
0:30:58,61 --> 0:31:0,61
good check, we already went to the Moon,


912
0:31:0,61 --> 0:31:2,61
we did a lunar surface stay for less than


913
0:31:2,61 --> 0:31:4,61
seven days.  But, as you extend beyond


914
0:31:4,61 --> 0:31:6,61
that it shows you that indeed,


915
0:31:6,61 --> 0:31:8,61
we gotta do


916
0:31:8,61 --> 0:31:10,61
for Near Earth Asteroids, longer duration lunar


917
0:31:10,61 --> 0:31:12,61
surface stays and


918
0:31:12,61 --> 0:31:14,61
Mars, we've got a lot of investment to do.


919
0:31:14,61 --> 0:31:16,61
And, so this a, it's a


920
0:31:16,61 --> 0:31:18,61
compelling driver for that.  This shows the same,


921
0:31:18,61 --> 0:31:20,61
just a little bit more technologies.


922
0:31:20,61 --> 0:31:22,61
But, we're using


923
0:31:22,61 --> 0:31:24,61
the international space station as the


924
0:31:24,61 --> 0:31:26,61
cornerstone of our human space flight ops.


925
0:31:26,61 --> 0:31:28,61
It's a great test bed, it's great for risk reduction,


926
0:31:28,61 --> 0:31:30,61
building off those partnerships.


927
0:31:30,61 --> 0:31:32,61
And, here's how we're going.


928
0:31:32,61 --> 0:31:34,61
We're taking that framework,


929
0:31:34,61 --> 0:31:36,61
these are a lot of the elements, or


930
0:31:36,61 --> 0:31:38,61
the building blocks that it takes to get there,


931
0:31:38,61 --> 0:31:40,61
these are the cross-cutting systems or


932
0:31:40,61 --> 0:31:42,61
capabilities that we need to have,


933
0:31:42,61 --> 0:31:44,61
in order to enable those.  And, here's how


934
0:31:44,61 --> 0:31:46,61
we're getting them through technologies, research,


935
0:31:46,61 --> 0:31:48,61
science.  And, it's the melding of


936
0:31:48,61 --> 0:31:50,61
of, the Science Mission Directorate's work


937
0:31:50,61 --> 0:31:52,61
it's the melding of the


938
0:31:52,61 --> 0:31:54,61
Office of the Chief Technologist's technology development work.


939
0:31:54,61 --> 0:31:56,61
ESMD and SOMD, as we


940
0:31:56,61 --> 0:31:58,61
merge through the human exploration and


941
0:31:58,61 --> 0:32:0,61
operations directorate, that's how it's all


942
0:32:0,61 --> 0:32:2,61
gonna work.  And, it's all about


943
0:32:2,61 --> 0:32:4,61
partnerships.  And, these are not just international,


944
0:32:4,61 --> 0:32:6,61
but also inter-agency and commercial.


945
0:32:6,61 --> 0:32:8,61
Ones that expand, or


946
0:32:8,61 --> 0:32:10,61
allow us to do things that we wouldn't have done


947
0:32:10,61 --> 0:32:12,61
otherwise, or enable


948
0:32:12,61 --> 0:32:14,61
meaning, if an international


949
0:32:14,61 --> 0:32:16,61
partner brings something, we might have planned it


950
0:32:16,61 --> 0:32:18,61
but, it might have been for 10 or 15 years


951
0:32:18,61 --> 0:32:20,61
down the line.  If they bring it, we'll be able


952
0:32:20,61 --> 0:32:22,61
to do that sooner.  To those that


953
0:32:22,61 --> 0:32:24,61
enhance smaller agencies.


954
0:32:24,61 --> 0:32:26,61
Uh, new


955
0:32:26,61 --> 0:32:28,61
and developing countries


956
0:32:28,61 --> 0:32:30,61
uh, they can each play a role


957
0:32:30,61 --> 0:32:32,61
and there's a piece of the puzzle for everyone. 


958
0:32:32,61 --> 0:32:34,61
Um, this is


959
0:32:34,61 --> 0:32:36,61
emblematic of some of the themes


960
0:32:36,61 --> 0:32:38,61
and the common goals.


961
0:32:38,61 --> 0:32:40,61
Essentially, these are the five themes


962
0:32:40,61 --> 0:32:42,61
that the 14 countries who participate


963
0:32:42,61 --> 0:32:44,61
in the international space exploration


964
0:32:44,61 --> 0:32:46,61
coordination group are 


965
0:32:46,61 --> 0:32:48,61
working together on.  These are what they agree on.


966
0:32:48,61 --> 0:32:50,61
Exploration is about a 


967
0:32:50,61 --> 0:32:52,61
sustained presence, for extending human


968
0:32:52,61 --> 0:32:54,61
frontiers, uh, new knowledge


969
0:32:54,61 --> 0:32:56,61
in science and technology, economic


970
0:32:56,61 --> 0:32:58,61
expansion, global partnerships, and


971
0:32:58,61 --> 0:33:0,61
inspiration and education.  


972
0:33:0,61 --> 0:33:2,61
And those below,


973
0:33:2,61 --> 0:33:4,61
also further refine,


974
0:33:4,61 --> 0:33:6,61
um, further refine


975
0:33:6,61 --> 0:33:8,61
and reflect the collective


976
0:33:8,61 --> 0:33:10,61
um, objectives of the international community.


977
0:33:10,61 --> 0:33:12,61
Um,


978
0:33:12,61 --> 0:33:14,61
I think all too often people say,


979
0:33:14,61 --> 0:33:16,61
"Well, you know, give us some examples."


980
0:33:16,61 --> 0:33:18,61
Well, those are the 14 countries.


981
0:33:18,61 --> 0:33:20,61
Uh, each of their symbols


982
0:33:20,61 --> 0:33:22,61
uh, displayed up above.


983
0:33:22,61 --> 0:33:24,61
And they do include


984
0:33:24,61 --> 0:33:26,61
Russia, they do include China,


985
0:33:26,61 --> 0:33:28,61
Japan, Europe,


986
0:33:28,61 --> 0:33:30,61
you see Korea,


987
0:33:30,61 --> 0:33:32,61
and several other nations.


988
0:33:32,61 --> 0:33:34,61
From an inter-agency perspective,


989
0:33:34,61 --> 0:33:36,61
we're working with the Department of Defense


990
0:33:36,61 --> 0:33:38,61
the intelligence community, the FAA


991
0:33:38,61 --> 0:33:40,61
Department of Energy, National Science Foundation


992
0:33:40,61 --> 0:33:42,61
Department of Homeland Security,


993
0:33:42,61 --> 0:33:44,61
uh, NIST, you name it.


994
0:33:44,61 --> 0:33:46,61
Um, and those are a couple of examples


995
0:33:46,61 --> 0:33:48,61
of how we're working. Same thing


996
0:33:48,61 --> 0:33:50,61
on the commercial.  We talked about the


997
0:33:50,61 --> 0:33:52,61
traditional aerospace, the entrepreneurial


998
0:33:52,61 --> 0:33:54,61
and the non-traditional 


999
0:33:54,61 --> 0:33:56,61
previously.


1000
0:33:56,61 --> 0:33:58,61
So, we already talked about


1001
0:33:58,61 --> 0:34:0,61
afforability being a big driver.


1002
0:34:0,61 --> 0:34:2,61
We're looking at that soup to nuts.


1003
0:34:2,61 --> 0:34:4,61
We're applying the 


1004
0:34:4,61 --> 0:34:6,61
skunk works capabilities.  


1005
0:34:6,61 --> 0:34:8,61
We're looking at our insight and oversight,


1006
0:34:8,61 --> 0:34:10,61
our contracting models, our requirement


1007
0:34:10,61 --> 0:34:12,61
systems, our governance.  


1008
0:34:12,61 --> 0:34:14,61
Across the board, Dan Dumbacher and


1009
0:34:14,61 --> 0:34:16,61
team are trying to really


1010
0:34:16,61 --> 0:34:18,61
embrace this in our traditional development


1011
0:34:18,61 --> 0:34:20,61
as well as trying to adopt


1012
0:34:20,61 --> 0:34:22,61
new ways of doing things.


1013
0:34:22,61 --> 0:34:24,61
Um, we met


1014
0:34:24,61 --> 0:34:26,61
with 25 different industry groups,


1015
0:34:26,61 --> 0:34:28,61
or businesses,


1016
0:34:28,61 --> 0:34:30,61
we took their inputs, and this is


1017
0:34:30,61 --> 0:34:32,61
kind of a smattering


1018
0:34:32,61 --> 0:34:34,61
uh, a smattering of their feedback


1019
0:34:34,61 --> 0:34:36,61
and results.  You know,


1020
0:34:36,61 --> 0:34:38,61
test and fly often,


1021
0:34:38,61 --> 0:34:40,61
systems engineering is critically


1022
0:34:40,61 --> 0:34:42,61
important, push decision authority


1023
0:34:42,61 --> 0:34:44,61
to the lowest level, maintain aggressive 


1024
0:34:44,61 --> 0:34:46,61
schedules, manage,


1025
0:34:46,61 --> 0:34:48,61
keep it simple.  And, you know, I think this


1026
0:34:48,61 --> 0:34:50,61
resonates with some of the other things that you've heard.


1027
0:34:50,61 --> 0:34:52,61
And, I think the bottom 


1028
0:34:52,61 --> 0:34:54,61
line is, that if we have


1029
0:34:54,61 --> 0:34:56,61
some focused and realistic and stable requirements,


1030
0:34:56,61 --> 0:34:58,61
with capable, and


1031
0:34:58,61 --> 0:35:0,61
connected, and properly incentivized teams


1032
0:35:0,61 --> 0:35:2,61
and schedules--


1033
0:35:2,61 --> 0:35:4,61
NASA does its best work


1034
0:35:4,61 --> 0:35:6,61
it seems 


1035
0:35:6,61 --> 0:35:8,61
on challenging schedules--


1036
0:35:8,61 --> 0:35:10,61
that helps all precipitate low cost,


1037
0:35:10,61 --> 0:35:12,61
highly successful results.


1038
0:35:12,61 --> 0:35:14,61
So, key takeaways


1039
0:35:14,61 --> 0:35:16,61
out of HEFT.


1040
0:35:16,61 --> 0:35:18,61
Uh, capability-driven framework is 


1041
0:35:18,61 --> 0:35:20,61
probably one of the major efforts


1042
0:35:20,61 --> 0:35:22,61
uh, NASA-wide transformational changes


1043
0:35:22,61 --> 0:35:24,61
is gonna be important, and I think we


1044
0:35:24,61 --> 0:35:26,61
have the leadership who is


1045
0:35:26,61 --> 0:35:28,61
ready to embrace that and


1046
0:35:28,61 --> 0:35:30,61
has been.  Um,


1047
0:35:30,61 --> 0:35:32,61
engaging in that


1048
0:35:32,61 --> 0:35:34,61
activity fairly vigorously.


1049
0:35:34,61 --> 0:35:36,61
Um, SLS


1050
0:35:36,61 --> 0:35:38,61
and MPCV are the core


1051
0:35:38,61 --> 0:35:40,61
first elements.


1052
0:35:40,61 --> 0:35:42,61
We do need to invest in some of our long term


1053
0:35:42,61 --> 0:35:44,61
capabilities.  Robotic precursors


1054
0:35:44,61 --> 0:35:46,61
are necessary if we're gonna actually go to


1055
0:35:46,61 --> 0:35:48,61
a NEA.  Um,


1056
0:35:48,61 --> 0:35:50,61
this is a fundamental change


1057
0:35:50,61 --> 0:35:52,61
but I believe it's, uh,


1058
0:35:52,61 --> 0:35:54,61
it's the right approach.  And not


1059
0:35:54,61 --> 0:35:56,61
so ironically, uh,


1060
0:35:56,61 --> 0:35:58,61
when we briefed the Russians


1061
0:35:58,61 --> 0:36:0,61
after 18 months of studying


1062
0:36:0,61 --> 0:36:2,61
uh, recently unveiled, I briefed this for


1063
0:36:2,61 --> 0:36:4,61
two and half hours, they briefed their


1064
0:36:4,61 --> 0:36:6,61
two hour deal


1065
0:36:6,61 --> 0:36:8,61
And they said, "Hey, we have a capability driven


1066
0:36:8,61 --> 0:36:10,61
framework and we want to work collaboratively."


1067
0:36:10,61 --> 0:36:12,61
And, I was actually shocked.


1068
0:36:12,61 --> 0:36:14,61
And, I talked to, uh,


1069
0:36:14,61 --> 0:36:16,61
I talked to, uh, talked to their folks afterward


1070
0:36:16,61 --> 0:36:18,61
and they said, "Why would you be surprised?"


1071
0:36:18,61 --> 0:36:20,61
We have the same political and economic


1072
0:36:20,61 --> 0:36:22,61
dynamics, this is just a reflection


1073
0:36:22,61 --> 0:36:24,61
of that and it's probably the modern paradigm


1074
0:36:24,61 --> 0:36:26,61
going forward, because no agency,


1075
0:36:26,61 --> 0:36:28,61
no single entity, can afford to


1076
0:36:28,61 --> 0:36:30,61
do beyond LEO exploration, uh,


1077
0:36:30,61 --> 0:36:32,61
alone.  And, so, last but not least,


1078
0:36:32,61 --> 0:36:34,61
uh, 


1079
0:36:34,61 --> 0:36:36,61
this last one is a 


1080
0:36:36,61 --> 0:36:38,61
Bryan O'Conner-ism, our


1081
0:36:38,61 --> 0:36:40,61
Chief Safety and Mission Assurance Officer.


1082
0:36:40,61 --> 0:36:42,61
We gotta have compelling, overarching mission


1083
0:36:42,61 --> 0:36:44,61
goals necessary to justify


1084
0:36:44,61 --> 0:36:46,61
the risks we're taking and the resources we're


1085
0:36:46,61 --> 0:36:48,61
laying out.  And that's


1086
0:36:48,61 --> 0:36:50,61
what it's all about, is laying that long term vector--


1087
0:36:50,61 --> 0:36:52,61
boots on Mars, sustained human


1088
0:36:52,61 --> 0:36:54,61
presence.  So,


1089
0:36:54,61 --> 0:36:56,61
In the next 


1090
0:36:56,61 --> 0:36:58,61
3 minutes, I'll just say, OK,


1091
0:36:58,61 --> 0:37:0,61
that's HEFT.  Now we've been continuing


1092
0:37:0,61 --> 0:37:2,61
on, we had a framework-- human exploration


1093
0:37:2,61 --> 0:37:4,61
framework-- now this is


1094
0:37:4,61 --> 0:37:6,61
the human architecture team


1095
0:37:6,61 --> 0:37:8,61
this is what's building it.  It's


1096
0:37:8,61 --> 0:37:10,61
cross agency, multi-disciplinary.


1097
0:37:10,61 --> 0:37:12,61
We're working the international,


1098
0:37:12,61 --> 0:37:14,61
we're working the multi-destinations.


1099
0:37:14,61 --> 0:37:16,61
Um,


1100
0:37:16,61 --> 0:37:18,61
Recent activities have been


1101
0:37:18,61 --> 0:37:20,61
helping, uh, refine the requirements for


1102
0:37:20,61 --> 0:37:22,61
SLS and MPCV.


1103
0:37:22,61 --> 0:37:24,61
We are working on a margins policy,


1104
0:37:24,61 --> 0:37:26,61
and this is not the programmatic margins policy,


1105
0:37:26,61 --> 0:37:28,61
but the architecture wide


1106
0:37:28,61 --> 0:37:30,61
approach. We've, uh,


1107
0:37:30,61 --> 0:37:32,61
we've been refining our international


1108
0:37:32,61 --> 0:37:34,61
exploration road map, for the


1109
0:37:34,61 --> 0:37:36,61
reasons I mentioned previously.


1110
0:37:36,61 --> 0:37:38,61
And, we're updating our technology prioritization.


1111
0:37:38,61 --> 0:37:40,61
This shows you how


1112
0:37:40,61 --> 0:37:42,61
we've got now a 


1113
0:37:42,61 --> 0:37:44,61
cycle, a cadence of, this is an


1114
0:37:44,61 --> 0:37:46,61
ongoing, evolutionary


1115
0:37:46,61 --> 0:37:48,61
uh, sustained architecture


1116
0:37:48,61 --> 0:37:50,61
effort for the agency.  We're meshing up


1117
0:37:50,61 --> 0:37:52,61
with the program milestones and the


1118
0:37:52,61 --> 0:37:54,61
international milestones. And,


1119
0:37:54,61 --> 0:37:56,61
you, know, this is what we've done over


1120
0:37:56,61 --> 0:37:58,61
the past, we're now looking at a crew of four


1121
0:37:58,61 --> 0:38:0,61
for all missions, but


1122
0:38:0,61 --> 0:38:2,61
geoservicing mission.  Why?


1123
0:38:2,61 --> 0:38:4,61
Because we get more international


1124
0:38:4,61 --> 0:38:6,61
offsets there, because we get a two person


1125
0:38:6,61 --> 0:38:8,61
EVA capability,


1126
0:38:8,61 --> 0:38:10,61
uh, by doing so.


1127
0:38:10,61 --> 0:38:12,61
We've been looking at crew


1128
0:38:12,61 --> 0:38:14,61
access to geostationary


1129
0:38:14,61 --> 0:38:16,61
LEO for servicing missions.


1130
0:38:16,61 --> 0:38:18,61
We've been looking at, uh,


1131
0:38:18,61 --> 0:38:20,61
at a balance of heavy lift and 


1132
0:38:20,61 --> 0:38:22,61
and, uh, expendable launch vehicles.


1133
0:38:22,61 --> 0:38:24,61
And so, a balance between commercial and government.


1134
0:38:24,61 --> 0:38:26,61
We've looked at, uh,


1135
0:38:26,61 --> 0:38:28,61
some of our Near Earth Asteroid


1136
0:38:28,61 --> 0:38:30,61
missions and we've also looked at a little bit of the


1137
0:38:30,61 --> 0:38:32,61
Phobos/Deimos.


1138
0:38:32,61 --> 0:38:34,61
These, these


1139
0:38:34,61 --> 0:38:36,61
are the design


1140
0:38:36,61 --> 0:38:38,61
reference missions.  This is a total org chart.


1141
0:38:38,61 --> 0:38:40,61
It's intended to be put in there


1142
0:38:40,61 --> 0:38:42,61
because you see everything 


1143
0:38:42,61 --> 0:38:44,61
in vivid detail is, uh.


1144
0:38:44,61 --> 0:38:46,61
We've got one for


1145
0:38:46,61 --> 0:38:48,61
low Earth orbit utilization,


1146
0:38:48,61 --> 0:38:50,61
uh, HEO/GEO vicinity


1147
0:38:50,61 --> 0:38:52,61
with and without 


1148
0:38:52,61 --> 0:38:54,61
predeployment of assets and resources


1149
0:38:54,61 --> 0:38:56,61
there.  Uh, lunar vicinity,


1150
0:38:56,61 --> 0:38:58,61
low lunar, lunar surface,


1151
0:38:58,61 --> 0:39:0,61
uh, minimum and 


1152
0:39:0,61 --> 0:39:2,61
full capability, Near Earth Asteroids


1153
0:39:2,61 --> 0:39:4,61
all the way out to Mars landing.


1154
0:39:4,61 --> 0:39:6,61
And you see the ones, that uh,


1155
0:39:6,61 --> 0:39:8,61
we've been emphasizing and


1156
0:39:8,61 --> 0:39:10,61
uh, and not, based upon the coloration.


1157
0:39:10,61 --> 0:39:12,61
So, um,


1158
0:39:12,61 --> 0:39:14,61
this is what's ahead.


1159
0:39:14,61 --> 0:39:16,61
We're working on currently


1160
0:39:16,61 --> 0:39:18,61
our min equipment lists,


1161
0:39:18,61 --> 0:39:20,61
we're looking at the impacts of the


1162
0:39:20,61 --> 0:39:22,61
uh, this four person crew


1163
0:39:22,61 --> 0:39:24,61
uh, taking a look at those driving


1164
0:39:24,61 --> 0:39:26,61
priorities, uh, for the


1165
0:39:26,61 --> 0:39:28,61
technologies, focusing on the


1166
0:39:28,61 --> 0:39:30,61
destinations ahead.


1167
0:39:30,61 --> 0:39:32,61
I don't think I need to spend any time


1168
0:39:32,61 --> 0:39:34,61
on that.  We now have


1169
0:39:34,61 --> 0:39:36,61
both destination and


1170
0:39:36,61 --> 0:39:38,61
element leads.  So this means, we've got


1171
0:39:38,61 --> 0:39:40,61
a person or a couple of people who are


1172
0:39:40,61 --> 0:39:42,61
bellybuttons for each one of these.


1173
0:39:42,61 --> 0:39:44,61
So, it 


1174
0:39:44,61 --> 0:39:46,61
helps address the challenge that


1175
0:39:46,61 --> 0:39:48,61
this isn't just, this 


1176
0:39:48,61 --> 0:39:50,61
isn't just a chaos and a 


1177
0:39:50,61 --> 0:39:52,61
destination to nowhere.


1178
0:39:52,61 --> 0:39:54,61
We have specific focal points who


1179
0:39:54,61 --> 0:39:56,61
own all the work, so we have


1180
0:39:56,61 --> 0:39:58,61
one-stop shopping for


1181
0:39:58,61 --> 0:40:0,61
Near Earth Asteroids or Moon,


1182
0:40:0,61 --> 0:40:2,61
or Mars and, uh,


1183
0:40:2,61 --> 0:40:4,61
we have a single bellybutton that


1184
0:40:4,61 --> 0:40:6,61
we can leverage on those.


1185
0:40:6,61 --> 0:40:8,61
Plus, we have elements leads for each one of these,


1186
0:40:8,61 --> 0:40:10,61
so as we look at developing commonalities,


1187
0:40:10,61 --> 0:40:12,61
strategies, or as we look at


1188
0:40:12,61 --> 0:40:14,61
saying, "How can we leverage the development 


1189
0:40:14,61 --> 0:40:16,61
dollars we're spending?" 


1190
0:40:16,61 --> 0:40:18,61
We'll have a single bellybutton to push on for that.


1191
0:40:18,61 --> 0:40:20,61
And, so, getting back to


1192
0:40:20,61 --> 0:40:22,61
engagement.  We have


1193
0:40:22,61 --> 0:40:24,61
a ten center team.


1194
0:40:24,61 --> 0:40:26,61
These are some of the people you see for the destination


1195
0:40:26,61 --> 0:40:28,61
in Space, Lunar, Near


1196
0:40:28,61 --> 0:40:30,61
Earth Objects or Near Earth Asteroids and 


1197
0:40:30,61 --> 0:40:32,61
Mars.  And, 


1198
0:40:32,61 --> 0:40:34,61
likewise, for the element team support, you can 


1199
0:40:34,61 --> 0:40:36,61
see each one of those functional areas


1200
0:40:36,61 --> 0:40:38,61
and the people.  But, these are just


1201
0:40:38,61 --> 0:40:40,61
the focal leads and I highly encourage


1202
0:40:40,61 --> 0:40:42,61
every single one of you guys


1203
0:40:42,61 --> 0:40:44,61
to engage: young, middle


1204
0:40:44,61 --> 0:40:46,61
old-- everybody.


1205
0:40:46,61 --> 0:40:48,61
Uh, this is our future.


1206
0:40:48,61 --> 0:40:50,61
This is how we collectively 


1207
0:40:50,61 --> 0:40:52,61
uh, harness that going forth.


1208
0:40:52,61 --> 0:40:54,61
So, bottom line is, we are


1209
0:40:54,61 --> 0:40:56,61
we are absolutely


1210
0:40:56,61 --> 0:40:58,61
looking forward to a robust future.


1211
0:40:58,61 --> 0:41:0,61
Our best days are not behind us.


1212
0:41:0,61 --> 0:41:2,61
We've had some incredible ones,


1213
0:41:2,61 --> 0:41:4,61
but our best days are before us.


1214
0:41:4,61 --> 0:41:6,61
And it's about extending and imagining


1215
0:41:6,61 --> 0:41:8,61
and bringing to fruition


1216
0:41:8,61 --> 0:41:10,61
uh, a 


1217
0:41:10,61 --> 0:41:12,61
sustained human presence beyond a


1218
0:41:12,61 --> 0:41:14,61
low Earth orbit.  We've got the bucks to do so.


1219
0:41:14,61 --> 0:41:16,61
It's not unlimited dollars, but


1220
0:41:16,61 --> 0:41:18,61
that's a great thing.


1221
0:41:18,61 --> 0:41:20,61
It's enough to get the job done and we need to


1222
0:41:20,61 --> 0:41:22,61
go do it.  We need to be safe and


1223
0:41:22,61 --> 0:41:24,61
affordable.  We've got some significant


1224
0:41:24,61 --> 0:41:26,61
progress.  We're not starting from 


1225
0:41:26,61 --> 0:41:28,61
scratch.  We're kick and start.


1226
0:41:28,61 --> 0:41:30,61
We've kick started at building off


1227
0:41:30,61 --> 0:41:32,61
of shuttle, station and constellation.


1228
0:41:32,61 --> 0:41:34,61
Um, and, uh,


1229
0:41:34,61 --> 0:41:36,61
our next challenge is to


1230
0:41:36,61 --> 0:41:38,61
execute.  And, I think


1231
0:41:38,61 --> 0:41:40,61
that brings, uh, I think that brings


1232
0:41:40,61 --> 0:41:42,61
uh, everything into bright


1233
0:41:42,61 --> 0:41:44,61
focus. So,


1234
0:41:44,61 --> 0:41:46,61
um, I would just like to say is,


1235
0:41:46,61 --> 0:41:48,61
is the prospects for the


1236
0:41:48,61 --> 0:41:50,61
