0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:9,794
[MUSIC]


2
0:0:9,794 --> 0:0:19,959



3
0:0:19,959 --> 0:0:21,685
BILL BASS: You get
a good, cold day


4
0:0:21,685 --> 0:0:24,1
like this, you don't--


5
0:0:24,1 --> 0:0:26,865
the decay rate is
not very rapid.


6
0:0:26,865 --> 0:0:28,0
It's slow.


7
0:0:28,0 --> 0:0:30,98
So it's slowed down on
a day like this.


8
0:0:30,98 --> 0:0:34,22
If you were here in the
summer, it would


9
0:0:34,22 --> 0:0:35,542
be going gray guts.


10
0:0:35,542 --> 0:0:47,11



11
0:0:47,11 --> 0:0:50,54
I'm the person that founded
what's called the Body Farm,


12
0:0:50,54 --> 0:0:54,38
which is a research facility
that we use to find out the


13
0:0:54,38 --> 0:0:57,67
length of time since death or
the changes that occur to the


14
0:0:57,67 --> 0:1:0,36
body and how long
does it take.


15
0:1:0,36 --> 0:1:3,46
And there are multiple
variables, the major factor


16
0:1:3,46 --> 0:1:4,319
being temperature.


17
0:1:4,319 --> 0:1:6,205
So you decay faster
in the summer than


18
0:1:6,205 --> 0:1:7,93
you do in the winter.


19
0:1:7,93 --> 0:1:9,82
And you have all the others.


20
0:1:9,82 --> 0:1:11,19
The clothing or no clothing.


21
0:1:11,19 --> 0:1:14,42
And this facility is set up to
look at all those variables.


22
0:1:14,42 --> 0:1:17,87



23
0:1:17,87 --> 0:1:21,65
I came here June the
1st of 1971.


24
0:1:21,65 --> 0:1:22,7
Knew the medical examiner.


25
0:1:22,7 --> 0:1:25,4
The medical examiner asked if
I would serve as a forensic


26
0:1:25,4 --> 0:1:27,29
anthropologist for medical
examiner system.


27
0:1:27,29 --> 0:1:29,3
And I said yes.


28
0:1:29,3 --> 0:1:31,8
And it wasn't long before bodies
started coming in.


29
0:1:31,8 --> 0:1:34,99
And about half of the
first 10 cases were


30
0:1:34,99 --> 0:1:37,4
maggot-covered bodies.


31
0:1:37,4 --> 0:1:40,26
And the police don't ask
you, who is that?


32
0:1:40,26 --> 0:1:42,89
They ask you, how long
have they been there?


33
0:1:42,89 --> 0:1:45,47
I think the reason for that, in
the criminal justice system


34
0:1:45,47 --> 0:1:47,71
they're trained the sooner you
get on the chase, the more


35
0:1:47,71 --> 0:1:49,75
likely you are to
solve the crime.


36
0:1:49,75 --> 0:1:51,44
Well, I didn't know a
thing about maggots.


37
0:1:51,44 --> 0:1:52,7
And I looked in the literature
and there


38
0:1:52,7 --> 0:1:55,1
really wasn't much there.


39
0:1:55,1 --> 0:1:59,39
And so I thought, we'd better
do some research on this.


40
0:1:59,39 --> 0:2:1,53
Because I want know what
I'm talking about


41
0:2:1,53 --> 0:2:3,12
when I talk to police.


42
0:2:3,12 --> 0:2:5,98
So I went to the dean in the
fall of '71, in November of


43
0:2:5,98 --> 0:2:7,14
'71 I went to the dean.


44
0:2:7,14 --> 0:2:9,74
I said, dean, I need some land
to put dead bodies on.


45
0:2:9,74 --> 0:2:11,94
And that was the beginning
of the Body Farm.


46
0:2:11,94 --> 0:2:16,4
JON JEFFERSON: He was the first
person to have this idea


47
0:2:16,4 --> 0:2:18,41
to research what happens
to bodies after


48
0:2:18,41 --> 0:2:20,36
death and when it happens.


49
0:2:20,36 --> 0:2:22,3
And the first person-- or at
least the first person to do


50
0:2:22,3 --> 0:2:23,29
something about it.


51
0:2:23,29 --> 0:2:27,48
BILL BASS: We have a number of
individuals who will kill


52
0:2:27,48 --> 0:2:28,82
their wives or kill
their husbands.


53
0:2:28,82 --> 0:2:32,8
And what do you do with a dead
wife or dead husband?


54
0:2:32,8 --> 0:2:34,28
Well, you gotta get rid of it.


55
0:2:34,28 --> 0:2:35,56
But how do you do that?


56
0:2:35,56 --> 0:2:38,18
Well, one of the things is
to go out in the yard.


57
0:2:38,18 --> 0:2:39,79
Mainly in the flower garden.


58
0:2:39,79 --> 0:2:41,64
And dig a grave.


59
0:2:41,64 --> 0:2:46,58
And somebody looks out and sees
and says, what you doing


60
0:2:46,58 --> 0:2:47,11
over there?


61
0:2:47,11 --> 0:2:49,83
Well, you can't say you're
burying your husband.


62
0:2:49,83 --> 0:2:55,14
So you put a concrete slab over
it and say you're pouring


63
0:2:55,14 --> 0:2:57,19
a little patio.


64
0:2:57,19 --> 0:3:1,11
We have a lot of bodies buried
under things like this in our


65
0:3:1,11 --> 0:3:2,5
culture today.


66
0:3:2,5 --> 0:3:4,83
This was a master's thesis in
which we're using ground


67
0:3:4,83 --> 0:3:8,96
penetrating radar to look
through the concrete and go


68
0:3:8,96 --> 0:3:10,0
down underneath it.


69
0:3:10,0 --> 0:3:12,86
It's interesting looking at
that project over the


70
0:3:12,86 --> 0:3:17,13
nine-month period that this
master's thesis ran.


71
0:3:17,13 --> 0:3:21,37
You could see that there
was a body under there.


72
0:3:21,37 --> 0:3:25,74
And as time goes by, you
can see the body decay.


73
0:3:25,74 --> 0:3:29,1
But normally, if you go out to
a crime scene, you wouldn't


74
0:3:29,1 --> 0:3:30,77
get that nine-month sequence.


75
0:3:30,77 --> 0:3:32,26
JON JEFFERSON: He's funny.


76
0:3:32,26 --> 0:3:33,57
He's charming.


77
0:3:33,57 --> 0:3:36,1
He's genuinely good-hearted.


78
0:3:36,1 --> 0:3:41,99
I can imagine that someone
without all those attributes


79
0:3:41,99 --> 0:3:44,63
might try to set up a facility
like this and just get


80
0:3:44,63 --> 0:3:45,89
nowhere with it.


81
0:3:45,89 --> 0:3:51,472
But he is legendary and beloved
in east Tennessee.


82
0:3:51,472 --> 0:3:56,49
BILL BASS: There's a skeleton
there that has no cover on it


83
0:3:56,49 --> 0:3:57,74
except for the leaves.


84
0:3:57,74 --> 0:4:0,35



85
0:4:0,35 --> 0:4:2,22
Here's one of the bones
way down here too.


86
0:4:2,22 --> 0:4:3,47
That's a [INAUDIBLE].


87
0:4:3,47 --> 0:4:8,405



88
0:4:8,405 --> 0:4:10,318
Put it back up there.


89
0:4:10,318 --> 0:4:13,706



90
0:4:13,706 --> 0:4:17,19
REBECCA WILSON: I handle the
William M. Bass Donated


91
0:4:17,19 --> 0:4:18,709
Skeletal Collection.


92
0:4:18,709 --> 0:4:22,88
It is the end product of
our donation program.


93
0:4:22,88 --> 0:4:26,43
And those individuals that have
willed themselves to our


94
0:4:26,43 --> 0:4:30,2
program to be used for both our
decomposition research as


95
0:4:30,2 --> 0:4:33,74
well as the skeletal aspect
of our research.


96
0:4:33,74 --> 0:4:39,24



97
0:4:39,24 --> 0:4:40,97
My name is Rebecca Wilson.


98
0:4:40,97 --> 0:4:43,74
I am the Assistant Coordinator
of the Forensic


99
0:4:43,74 --> 0:4:46,5
Anthropology Center.


100
0:4:46,5 --> 0:4:49,35
This collection started
in 1981.


101
0:4:49,35 --> 0:4:54,74
And anyone that wills themself
to our program to be used for


102
0:4:54,74 --> 0:4:56,58
research at the Anthropological
Research


103
0:4:56,58 --> 0:5:1,67
Facility is eventually brought
here and is stored here in


104
0:5:1,67 --> 0:5:2,57
perpetuity.


105
0:5:2,57 --> 0:5:5,11
So they are stored-- as
long as we exist,


106
0:5:5,11 --> 0:5:6,71
they will be here.


107
0:5:6,71 --> 0:5:11,48
Currently we have just over
700 individuals in the


108
0:5:11,48 --> 0:5:14,9
collection, which makes it the
largest collection in the


109
0:5:14,9 --> 0:5:18,42
United States of modern
Americans.


110
0:5:18,42 --> 0:5:21,67
It exceeds the next largest
program from about 400


111
0:5:21,67 --> 0:5:22,42
individuals.


112
0:5:22,42 --> 0:5:24,36
So it's fairly substantial.


113
0:5:24,36 --> 0:5:28,49
We had individuals where
they have been directly


114
0:5:28,49 --> 0:5:30,89
affected by a case.


115
0:5:30,89 --> 0:5:34,73
Whether they were a victim or
they had a member of the


116
0:5:34,73 --> 0:5:36,22
family that was a victim.


117
0:5:36,22 --> 0:5:40,55
And those individuals are
usually more interested in the


118
0:5:40,55 --> 0:5:42,37
decomposition research.


119
0:5:42,37 --> 0:5:44,82
And they really want to be used
as much as possible for


120
0:5:44,82 --> 0:5:50,19
forensic-related research at
our research facility.


121
0:5:50,19 --> 0:5:52,13
We also have people
that we just want


122
0:5:52,13 --> 0:5:54,14
to be used for teaching.


123
0:5:54,14 --> 0:5:56,89
They're either the individuals
that want their skeleton on


124
0:5:56,89 --> 0:6:0,28
display in a classroom, which,
obviously we cannot.


125
0:6:0,28 --> 0:6:5,96
And we tell them that having a
skeleton restrung or kind of


126
0:6:5,96 --> 0:6:12,8
put back together is not
as beneficial for us.


127
0:6:12,8 --> 0:6:15,22
So we have those individuals
that are just like, I want to


128
0:6:15,22 --> 0:6:16,39
be used for teaching.


129
0:6:16,39 --> 0:6:19,3
And those individuals that
choose that and highlight that


130
0:6:19,3 --> 0:6:20,74
are more of the academics.


131
0:6:20,74 --> 0:6:21,76
A lot of them--


132
0:6:21,76 --> 0:6:26,22
you'll see a lot of nurses and
a lot of teachers that say, I


133
0:6:26,22 --> 0:6:28,5
really want to be used
for that aspect.


134
0:6:28,5 --> 0:6:30,31
Obviously, when we go on a case,
you're starting in your


135
0:6:30,31 --> 0:6:31,98
head putting pieces together.


136
0:6:31,98 --> 0:6:35,27
And know where to look when
you get back to that lab.


137
0:6:35,27 --> 0:6:40,15
So to me, having the skeletons
available in the collection is


138
0:6:40,15 --> 0:6:43,6
a way so that students can learn
what they are expected


139
0:6:43,6 --> 0:6:47,72
to find and know in the field
and in the lab situation.


140
0:6:47,72 --> 0:6:51,58
But also be an avenue for
research with those age


141
0:6:51,58 --> 0:6:52,8
indicators.


142
0:6:52,8 --> 0:6:55,55
Looking at, OK, the difference
between males and females.


143
0:6:55,55 --> 0:6:57,79
Looking at the way we age.


144
0:6:57,79 --> 0:6:59,87
Because those are things that
do change with time.


145
0:6:59,87 --> 0:7:2,93
And having a modern collection
available to do that is


146
0:7:2,93 --> 0:7:5,12
extremely important.


147
0:7:5,12 --> 0:7:7,26
So we get now--


148
0:7:7,26 --> 0:7:11,22
this past year we've had 26
researchers from other


149
0:7:11,22 --> 0:7:14,29
institutions coming just
to use the collection.


150
0:7:14,29 --> 0:7:15,48
And that's amazing.


151
0:7:15,48 --> 0:7:20,0
And the number of requests
increases every year.


152
0:7:20,0 --> 0:7:21,89
And so to me, it's a value.


153
0:7:21,89 --> 0:7:23,42
This is a data set.


154
0:7:23,42 --> 0:7:25,9
And it's a resource for
other people to use.


155
0:7:25,9 --> 0:7:34,126



156
0:7:34,126 --> 0:7:38,2
BILL BASS: They're having
troubles in courts these days


157
0:7:38,2 --> 0:7:45,362
where the average juror is a
member of the community.


158
0:7:45,362 --> 0:7:51,57
And CSI has been so successful
that people think if you don't


159
0:7:51,57 --> 0:7:53,56
do it like it's done
on CSI then there's


160
0:7:53,56 --> 0:7:55,58
something wrong with you.


161
0:7:55,58 --> 0:7:58,34
And so you've got to
convince them, hey.


162
0:7:58,34 --> 0:8:0,75
We don't get it done
in an hour.


163
0:8:0,75 --> 0:8:6,74
And it takes a little bit more
research than what CSI shows


164
0:8:6,74 --> 0:8:7,99
that's going on.


165
0:8:7,99 --> 0:8:10,67



166
0:8:10,67 --> 0:8:12,55
We've had a couple
of experiments.


167
0:8:12,55 --> 0:8:16,92
We wanted to reproduce death in
a trailer to see how long


168
0:8:16,92 --> 0:8:19,31
it takes for a body to
decay in a trailer


169
0:8:19,31 --> 0:8:20,75
situation like that.


170
0:8:20,75 --> 0:8:24,4
Occasionally we'll try to
reproduce a crime scene which


171
0:8:24,4 --> 0:8:27,81
there's not much in
the literature on.


172
0:8:27,81 --> 0:8:32,58
And that was one of the ones
that we'd done that.


173
0:8:32,58 --> 0:8:36,13
And there's a body
under there.


174
0:8:36,13 --> 0:8:41,809
And the reason we cover them up
with black plastic is that


175
0:8:41,809 --> 0:8:44,64
maggots don't like sunlight.


176
0:8:44,64 --> 0:8:53,0
So when a body is out here, and
you have it in the sun and


177
0:8:53,0 --> 0:8:57,79
the shade and so forth, the
maggots will get on the body.


178
0:8:57,79 --> 0:8:59,64
But they will get down
under the skin.


179
0:8:59,64 --> 0:9:2,65
So they will leave the
skin as an umbrella.


180
0:9:2,65 --> 0:9:4,23
You will find a body
out sometime.


181
0:9:4,23 --> 0:9:5,6
It looks fairly good
condition.


182
0:9:5,6 --> 0:9:7,68
But when you get up to that
body and look at it very


183
0:9:7,68 --> 0:9:12,57
carefully, you'll find that
the skin is just leather.


184
0:9:12,57 --> 0:9:14,73
Literally it has turned
to leather.


185
0:9:14,73 --> 0:9:19,39
And there's nothing there
but a skeleton


186
0:9:19,39 --> 0:9:21,79
with a leather covering.


187
0:9:21,79 --> 0:9:26,32
And what we're trying to
do is to get down to


188
0:9:26,32 --> 0:9:28,9
the skeletal remains.


189
0:9:28,9 --> 0:9:32,15
We put that on there so that the
maggots will do a better


190
0:9:32,15 --> 0:9:35,8
job of cleaning the
skeletons off.


191
0:9:35,8 --> 0:9:40,9
We have buried here
five burials.


192
0:9:40,9 --> 0:9:44,1
When we buried the individuals,
we ran pipes down


193
0:9:44,1 --> 0:9:46,96
and ran pipes through
the body.


194
0:9:46,96 --> 0:9:50,57
And this is to get the
compounds, the volatile fatty


195
0:9:50,57 --> 0:9:52,45
acids that are given
off the body.


196
0:9:52,45 --> 0:9:56,88
One of my doctoral students
who's doing this project has


197
0:9:56,88 --> 0:9:59,73
found over 500 compounds
that are given


198
0:9:59,73 --> 0:10:2,1
off of decaying bodies.


199
0:10:2,1 --> 0:10:7,22
Now not all 500 of those are
equal in identifying a body.


200
0:10:7,22 --> 0:10:8,77
But he has designed a sniffer.


201
0:10:8,77 --> 0:10:12,82
A handheld device that you can
walk across the ground.


202
0:10:12,82 --> 0:10:17,34
And if you find one of those
compounds that he's using in


203
0:10:17,34 --> 0:10:20,56
his data bank, you can
tell that there's


204
0:10:20,56 --> 0:10:21,63
a buried body there.


205
0:10:21,63 --> 0:10:25,99
So this is the type of research
that we're doing.


206
0:10:25,99 --> 0:10:27,6
Now the next question
that comes up.


207
0:10:27,6 --> 0:10:28,85
The reason they're still here.


208
0:10:28,85 --> 0:10:31,54



209
0:10:31,54 --> 0:10:34,77
Do you get the same compounds
given off of a body that's


210
0:10:34,77 --> 0:10:37,33
been dead two years that
you get the first year?


211
0:10:37,33 --> 0:10:38,25
We don't know that.


212
0:10:38,25 --> 0:10:39,52
So we left it.


213
0:10:39,52 --> 0:10:41,4
And we're now in the
fourth year.


214
0:10:41,4 --> 0:10:42,67
These things have been
here four years.


215
0:10:42,67 --> 0:10:47,73
And there are some decreases
of some.


216
0:10:47,73 --> 0:10:50,14
But, of course, how long are
you going to leave them?


217
0:10:50,14 --> 0:10:51,51
Well, I don't know how long
we'll leave them.


218
0:10:51,51 --> 0:10:57,71
It'll depend on when you get a
point of diminishing returns.


219
0:10:57,71 --> 0:10:59,57
But we do have individuals--


220
0:10:59,57 --> 0:11:4,5
we do have cadaver dog handlers
who say that, oh,


221
0:11:4,5 --> 0:11:6,94
their dogs can smell
Civil War graves.


222
0:11:6,94 --> 0:11:13,36
Well, that's 140 years ago.


223
0:11:13,36 --> 0:11:15,466
I don't know.


224
0:11:15,466 --> 0:11:18,3
I wonder a little
bit about that.


225
0:11:18,3 --> 0:11:23,16
But we do now have the
techniques in forensic


226
0:11:23,16 --> 0:11:26,55
anthropology area that we
can go about looking


227
0:11:26,55 --> 0:11:27,8
at things like that.


228
0:11:27,8 --> 0:13:27,8
