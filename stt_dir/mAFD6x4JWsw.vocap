###14 [DJ SCREW TRACK]
###44 TRACE: Houston seemed the perfect destination for us to
###46 cover both a rock and roll and a drug story.
###49 [RAP]
###52 TRACE: Today, the influence of Houston is huge across the
###55 whole rap community.
###57 [RAP]
###60 TRACE: This started basically because of a
###61 guy named DJ Screw.
###63 He invented chopped and screwed music, which was
###65 essentially slowing down existing records to a snail's
###68 pace, like a syrupy drawl.
###71 [DJ SCREW TRACK]
###78 TRACE: One of the defining characteristics of chopped and
###80 screwed music is drinking codeine-based cough syrup.
###83 
###86 So we went down.
###87 We drank some cough syrup, and we listened to some chopped
###90 and screwed.
###91 [RAP]
###102 TRACE: Now I'm from Houston.
###103 I don't know a lot about chopped and screwed.
###105 I had to have somebody who could lead me around.
###108 Luckily, I met up with this guy named Kyu Boi, who had
###110 been a wrapper in the scene, and part of
###111 the South Park Coalition.
###113 The South Park Coalition has been around
###115 since the late '80s.
###115 They're one of the older crews in Houston.
###118 Kyu Boi was this real dynamic guy, real funny guy, and
###122 through him I was able to meet most all the people.
###124 [RAP]
###134 TRACE: Kyu Boi realized I didn't know
###135 anything about rap music.
###136 He told me the first thing I had to do was go through the
###138 two most important neighborhoods in this story--
###140 South Park and the Third Ward.
###142 
###145 KYU BOI: now, you in the slums of Third Ward.
###149 This is where we at, Houston, Texas, Third Ward Area.
###153 TRACE: This doesn't look so good.
###153 [RAP]
###158 KYU BOI: We're on Live Oak Street, right in the heart of
###160 Third Ward.
###161 That's H-Town, Texas, Third Ward.
###163 This really is a grimy location.
###166 As you can see, there's really not too architecture-type
###169 structures around here.
###170 A lot of dope fiends, a lot of junkies.
###172 As you can see, my boy right here, him, on that bike,
###175 that's the product of Third Ward.
###177 Looking at him will let you know where your life will be
###180 if you don't get your shit right-- riding a fucking
###182 bicycle, looking like Bob Marley fucking grandpa.
###186 See those people over there looking angry?
###189 Those are the people that you got to meet.
###191 TRACE: The first guy we went to meet in the Third Ward is
###193 Dope E. And he's a particularly important part of
###195 the South Park Coalition.
###197 DOPE E: D-O-P-E, capital E. Stands for dope effects,
###202 because of the dope-ass music I do and the
###204 effects I put to it.
###205 That's what we about, beats and rhymes.
###208 (FREESTYLING) on the music trying to make it last.
###209 Just chilling in a [INAUDIBLE].
###211 [SINGING]
###218 TRACE: Dope E has a great recording studio in this
###220 house, where members from the South Park Coalition can come
###222 over there and record tracks.
###224 EVERYONE JAMMING: It's all about the dough.
###226 Standing making cash flow.
###228 Building up in escrow.
###230 TRACE: There's also a lot of really strange rules that he
###232 has pinned up on the front door.
###234 DOPE E: I run a studio, closed session, appointments only.
###236 We going check out the music.
###238 No visitors, though.
###238 You got to get in touch with me before you come to my pad.
###242 Do not bring dead animals inside of my
###244 house and eat them--
###246 cows, pigs, chicken, turkeys, et cetera.
###249 No disagreeables beyond this point.
###253 The most important thing is that you decide what side you
###256 want to be on, agreeable or disagreeable.
###258 Because Humpty Dumpty, he fell the fuck off the wall, sitting
###261 his ass up there.
###262 Cracked his whole shell.
###262 Pick a side.
###263 [SPC TRACK]
###272 KYU BOI: I got us two invitations to a thug barbecue
###275 in the hood, in South Park.
###276 And all you got to do is just act black.
###279 Act black and be yourself.
###280 [RAP]
###290 TRACE: It's not a cookout.
###292 These are not veggie patties.
###293 These are not tofu pups.
###295 We're not warming shit.
###295 We're barbecuing it with smoke, real fire.
###298 This is the way people roll in Texas.
###300 J CHILL: It's just that that South Side Texas flavor.
###304 [EXCLAMATORY SOUND], you know?
###306 TRACE: The barbecue is going on, great gangbusters.
###308 You see all these guys drinking, getting up on weed.
###311 They're barbecuing all this meat.
###312 And they have pythons and what have you.
###314 Pretty soon, the music starts playing.
###316 And before long everyone is freestyling.
###318 D ONE: (FREESTYLING) Hold on.
###319 I gotta put this on camera.
###320 I got on jewels, but my name ain't Santana.
###323 I ain't from [INAUDIBLE], but I will [INAUDIBLE]
###327 TRACE: A lot of people know about the music scene in
###329 Houston primarily because of Paul Wall and Mike Jones.
###332 But it's in places like this backyard where it began.
###334 DOPE E: (FREESTYLING) [INAUDIBLE]
###336 Coalition.
###336 While we make amends like better men.
###339 We get better.
###339 And now we chilling [INAUDIBLE].
###341 Ten years looking for shit.
###343 Now we back.
###344 [INAUDIBLE]
###345 doing something black.
###346 K-RINO: I can remember when it wasn't a scene.
###348 People laughed at us.
###349 People thought we was country.
###351 People said all we did down here was ride
###354 horses and rope cows.
###356 Somebody got to be the person to get the ball rolling.
###358 In my eyes, it was Face and the Geto Boys that did that.
###362 WILLIE D: The Geto Boys was actually formed in '87.
###364 But not until '89 did we start gaining some regional and
###370 national notoriety.
###372 It just kicked the door in and ushered in a in whole new crop
###375 of rappers in Houston.
###376 It really gave people hope.
###379 K-RINO: When Face dropped the song, "Scarface," that's what
###382 gave everybody motivation.
###384 I can do this, too.
###385 
###388 TRACE: In between Paul Walls and the Geto Boys, is the rise
###391 of this guy, DJ Screw.
###393 DISTA: All this slow music and chopped and screwed, purple
###396 stuff, drank, lean that cup, from us.
###398 We got the whole world onto it.
###399 Ain't no way y'all can acknowledge the world and not
###401 acknowledge Houston.
###403 [RAP]
###411 TRACE: What's happening, my baby?
###413 I heard you're rolling down the road.
###414 I had to get up in there.
###415 How you doing?
###415 BALDHEAD: Alright, man.
###417 TRACE: I love your rod, man.
###418 I need to work on my style a little bit, or you think maybe
###420 I can make this happen?
###421 BALDHEAD: Loosen your tie.
###422 Relax a little bit.
###424 TRACE: I'm thinking about maybe getting Thug Lite,
###426 L-I-T-E.
###427 BALDHEAD: [LAUGHING]
###427 You'll get hit up.
###429 TRACE: Or maybe Thug White.
###429 BALDHEAD: You crazy.
###430 [LAUGHTER]
###433 [KLONDIKE KAT TRACK]
###455 DISTA: We been doing our thing.
###456 We been rocking big chains.
###457 We been riding slabs, big rims, all that.
###461 We've been doing that.
###461 Half of the styles that's out right now, come from Houston.
###465 There's a lot of people emulating our style and using
###468 our words, and they running with it.

###503 TRACE: One of our first stops is to go meet the king of
###505 bling, Johnny Dang, a.k.a TV Johnny.
###508 [RAP]
###514 TRACE: Going to meet Johnny Dang today, grill

###558 TRACE: Hey, you hear that sound, Johnny, that sound that
###561 goes [BEEP]?
###561 JOHNNY DANG: Yeah.
###562 TRACE: You need to change it so it goes "bling."
###564 JOHNNY DANG: That's a good idea.
###566 We do a lot of custom piece, necklace.
###569 So, it's personalized like this one.
###573 This is for JD.
###574 TRACE: It almost looks like it could be the knocker on a door
###577 when you come to the house.
###578 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###580 JOHNNY DANG: That's good-looking.
###581 TRACE: I've got a lot of good ideas.
###582 Maybe I could start working with you.

###621 TRACE: I got to work on my handshake.
###622 
###625 I couldn't afford any of the grills that Johnny
###626 Dang had for sale.
###627 But what I realized was everybody had a t-shirt with
###629 their face on it.
###630 So I thought I'd see if I could afford one of those.
###632 This is my man, Sleek.
###633 SLEEK: Sleek.
###634 TRACE: He runs the airbrush store.
###635 Tell me what you do here, Sleek.

###661 FBI agent.
###661 [LAUGHTER]
###665 TRACE: Once you got the clothes, and got the jewelry,
###667 gotta get yourself a ride.
###669 The kind of car to have in Houston, if you want to roll
###671 with the big boys, is a slab--
###673 slow, loud, and banging.
###674 [RAP]
###678 TRACE: I like this car.
###679 What years is this?
###680 BALDHEAD: '73.
###680 Chevy Impala.
###682 TRACE: How long have you had it?

###688 Stay customized.
###689 Slab.

###691 BALDHEAD: Custom, baby.
###692 [RAP]
###699 It's a slab.
###701 We deck everything out with the rims, the pop trunk,
###704 Lamborghini doors, the music.
###705 [RAP]
###709 TRACE: Not moving very fast, are we?
###710 BALDHEAD: No, we just in the traffic,
###712 crawling through here.
###714 Snail's pace.
###714 Checking it out.

###721 Women love cars.
###722 [RAP]
###735 [INAUDIBLE]
###736 
###741 [RAP AND CHEERING]
###760 TRACE: There's a lot of things I learned about rap music when
###762 I was in Houston.
###763 One of the things that I didn't know was how hard all
###765 these guys work.
###766 It's incredible.
###767 Guys are always hustling.
###769 So every time you walk up somewhere, your pockets are
###771 filled with fliers and stickers.
###773 And everywhere they go it's a new promotion.
###775 And they got a new CD.
###777 And they're doing all this stuff.
###778 It's nothing like some lame little indie rockers here in
###780 Brooklyn who are moping around.
###782 They're businessmen, and then they're rappers.
###785 [RAP]
###790 BALDHEAD: You got to grind and put it down
###792 every day, every night.
###793 Live it.
###794 Talk it.
###794 Want it.
###795 Every day.
###795 And it's going to go down for you, baby.
###797 [RAP]
###805 KILLAHOE: [INAUDIBLE] music more than anything.
###807 We are young black entrepreneurs.
###808 You know what I'm saying, not a gang.
###810 DOUGIE D: We were born to be entrepreneurs down here.
###812 BALDHEAD: Welcome to the South Side.
###813 This is going to be my project right here.
###814 KB: KB da Kidnapper, Street Military.
###817 CL'CHE': My name is Cl'che'.
###818 That's spelled C-L-apostrophe-C-H-E. I'm on
###820 myspace.com, too.
###821 You can check it out.

###832 I'm doing one [INAUDIBLE]
###833 right now.
###834 SHOWTYME: Got the Showtyme block party DVD fixing to get
###836 here, hit the streets.
###836 DOUGIE D: We have this new cologne called Pure Pizazz.
###839 BUN B: Artists in Houston out here, more than most other
###841 regions are primarily businessmen first.
###844 They took all the fun out of this shit for us out here.
###847 All the making a record and going somewhere and giving
###850 someone your demo, hoping you get a deal.
###851 We did that shit.
###852 We tried that shit for years, got turned down.
###854 Every door slammed in your face.
###857 [RAP]
###862 BUN B: None of guys ever thought they'd ever get a
###864 major recording deal.
###865 Most of them had seen people try before them.
###868 Some of them had tried themselves.
###870 These guys learned to make what they needed to make
###874 happen outside of the system.
###876 We just said, fuck it.
###876 And it's that fuck it mentality that gets these cats
###879 great deals.
###880 And they will take advantage of the game like they want to.
###882 [RAP]
###887 KB: I started off in the Street
###889 Military back in the '90s.
###892 We put out first record out in '91, on Gerard Records.
###896 Back then we were selling records without getting no
###899 radio play.
###900 We made our mark on the streets.
###902 The radio ain't make us.
###903 We made our mark on the streets.
###905 TRACE: These guys operate outside the major
###907 record label systems.
###909 They make more money selling it out of the back of their
###911 car, selling it on the street, hustling it themselves, than
###914 they would ever make if they signed a deal.
###916 MAN: Better watch out for us.
###916 We got a lot of big things coming.
###918 TRACE: It's rumored that DJ Screw sold something like this
###920 50,000 copies of a single mix.
###925 BUN B: I think the screw sound, and the fact that
###927 someone like Screw was selling these thousands of mix tapes
###929 out of his house, and people were getting all this big
###932 local fame and shit off of mix tape songs.
###934 And then that was selling 40,000, 50,000 units based on
###937 this type of stuff.
###938 They weren't just new artists looking for a deal.
###940 They were businessmen.
###941 And if they wanted to try to come down here and use us to
###944 latch onto the Southern music by a market, it's
###946 going to cost them.
###947 Because we're already tied into the market.
###949 And we don't need them to get our music to the people.
###951 [RAP]
###954 KB: All I need is distribution.
###956 $8 a CD at wholesale price.
###959 Fuck another record company trying to fuck me.
###961 Hey, it's over with.
###962 You heard me?
###963 [RAP]
###971 We made the vibration over time.
###973 DOPE E: And by sticking together through trials and
###975 showing everybody how to do their shit fully, that has a
###978 lot to do with it.
###979 And that same attitude is what other Coalition members did.
###982 Each one teach one.
###983 I started showing all the ones [INAUDIBLE] growing up with.
###986 That's one thing.
###987 All you got to do is tell us.
###989 And tell the next person.
###990 We got that shit, as long as you tell us.
###993 J CHILL: I remember a point in time when we used to go
###995 retirement studio, shit like that.
###998 We ain't got to do that no more.
###999 TRACE: There's a real tradition in Houston of
###1001 putting your money back into your home recording studio.
###1004 So when you go to somebody like Devin the Dude's place,
###1006 you're totally blown away by his setup.
###1008 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1016 DEVIN THE DUDE: This has been happening for a while, Coughee
###1019 Brotha Tony and Boomer Henfield, they
###1021 started back in the day.
###1023 They old man called [INAUDIBLE].
###1025 
###1028 Drink a cup of coffee, [INAUDIBLE]
###1031 We always incorporate that with the rhymes and what we've
###1034 been doing over the years.
###1035 TRACE: The guys are extremely prolific.
###1036 They all rap on each other's records.
###1038 Some of them are putting out 10, 15, 20 records a year.
###1043 WILLIE D: There are some grinding.
###1044 There are some true grinders in this business today.
###1048 These dudes work, work, work, work, work.
###1051 They got killer work ethics.
###1053 BALDHEAD: You got to get up off that ass
###1054 and put work down.
###1055 If you don't represent you, who's going to
###1056 represent you for you?
###1057 Everybody cry about this cat, this cat, done that.
###1060 Let me tell you something.
###1061 You gotta grind, baby.
###1062 [RAP]
###1065 DOPE E: It's really just dedication and unity.
###1068 It's just us sticking together.
###1070 And saying, no matter what, I'm going to put SPC first.
###1072 And I'm going to do this motherfucking music.
###1074 (FREESTYLING) niggers, they shoot, rob banks.
###1076 Most of these people, they come around in a Hummer tank.
###1079 When you got some real motherfuckers that hook up
###1081 together, that's the vibration.
###1083 That's what happen.
###1084 D ONE: (FREESTYLING) She said, oh no.
###1086 I had to break her off slow.
###1087 Come through the South Side, [INAUDIBLE].
###1090 BUN B: We watch hip hop.
###1090 We want people gaining strength and numbers.
###1093 So that's all we did, was apply that shit to what we
###1096 were doing.
###1097 We didn't invent nothing.
###1098 [RAP]
###1103 BUN B: Initially, we all were selling Houston.
###1105 But now, we get to come together as a collective and
###1107 say, we are Houston.
###1109 Some of us don't get along-- hell a lot of people don't get
###1112 along with each other.
###1112 But, when it comes to Houston, to the bigger picture, we
###1115 going put bullshit aside and stand up for the city.
###1117 J CHILL: They should do it like the big white dudes in
###1119 them companies, and shit.
###1120 They might not like each other.
###1121 But shit, they'll go to work, and make money together.
###1123 And say, fuck it on weekend.
###1124 Don't ask me what the fuck I did when I'm at home, nigger.
###1126 You just do your shit.
###1127 I'm going to do mine.
###1128 We going make this money together.
###1130 It's a beautiful thing, if you just take care of business and
###1132 do your shit, and don't make it about that bullshit.
###1135 [RAP]
###1147 TRACE: And one of the biggest hustlers of them all, the guy
###1149 who's had the most profound impact to this
###1152 point, is DJ Screw.
###1153 [RAP]
###1165 
###1169 [RAP]
###1201 TRACE: The sound that Houston is most well known for today,
###1204 which is now known as chopped and screwed, literally started
###1207 with one guy--
###1209 DJ Screw in Houston, Texas.
###1210 [RAP]
###1215 MAN: This the king right here.
###1217 He's DJ Screw.
###1219 DOUGIE D: H-Town, we really have a sound of our own.
###1222 South Side swag and a sound that can't just really be
###1225 emulated all [INAUDIBLE].
###1226 Everybody who [INAUDIBLE] all screwed up, we is screwed up.
###1230 [RAP]
###1242 BUN B: A lot of people, they don't know about DJ Screw.
###1244 DJ Screw is a local DJ from Houston, Texas who invented
###1247 his own style of mixing.
###1249 What he did was he slowed the records down a little past
###1251 half speed.
###1253 Kind of blended the songs together, a little bit easy.
###1255 And it was something that fit the slowed down, laid back,
###1257 chill Southern vibe of Houston.
###1260 That started around '92, early '93.
###1264 Got nationwide fame around '95.
###1266 [RAP]
###1274 TRACE: The idea seems to have come from him when he was
###1276 drinking this codeine cough syrup.
###1278 Now what syrup does is it's loaded with codeine.
###1282 It's a narcotic induced kind of relaxation.
###1285 You're really kind of out of it, and everything is
###1287 amorphous and cloudy and very slow.
###1291 So DJ Screw is in his bedroom.
###1292 He's up on the weed.
###1293 He's up on codeine, and he starts slowing records down in
###1297 an attempt to get them to sound
###1299 exactly the way he feels.
###1300 [MUSIC SLOWING DOWN]
###1320 KLONDIKE KAT: While they was listening to they slowed down
###1322 music, they was drinking they codeine.
###1324 Guys, including Screw, that hung with Screw,
###1327 that's what they did.

###1333 [INAUDIBLE]
###1334 1980-motherfucking-5 [INAUDIBLE]
###1338 [MUSIC]
###1346 BUN B: With rap, mostly just kind of writing the same
###1348 rhymes and making most of the same beats over and over
###1350 again, this was some new shit, some original shit that no
###1353 other city, no other region could lay claim to.
###1355 And it gave Houston its own regional identity, apart from
###1359 everything else that was going on.
###1361 TRACE: Screw started making these tapes at house, the
###1364 Great Tapes.
###1365 They became a cultural phenomenon.
###1367 MAC NYCE: When Screw was doing his thing at his crib, and he
###1369 had people coming like it was a club.
###1371 His whole street would be lined up with cars, people
###1373 trying to buy Screw tapes.
###1375 LANCE: You never forget the first time you heard DJ Screw.
###1377 And without fail you heard it from a car.
###1380 And you would hear this booming music coming out with
###1383 this really low, slowed down voice.
###1385 And without fail, if you were standing with a group of
###1387 people in those first few years, one of them always had
###1390 this really puzzled look on his face.
###1391 Somebody else would say, oh, that's DJ Screw.
###1393 [DJ SCREW TRACK]
###1398 Screw ended up getting a real big following on the south
###1401 side of town, to the southwest, to the north side.
###1404 He had a lot of different emcees together to come and
###1406 freestyle on the mix tapes that he was making.
###1408 People like Lil KeKe, ESG, the Botany Boys, [INAUDIBLE], a
###1413 lot of different people represented Screwed Up
###1416 Clique, Li'l Flip.
###1417 LANCE: He would talk to you during the tapes.
###1418 He would just emcee through the whole thing.
###1421 [DJ SCREW TRACK]
###1426 TRAE: Screw was our form of radio.
###1429 That's who had us going.
###1431 Even if he wasn't flowing on the tapes, he had
###1433 the songs on tape.
###1434 If you song made it to a Screw tape, people paid attention to
###1437 it real serious.
###1438 MAC NYCE: Everybody and they mama was saying it's
###1440 not going to work.
###1441 Everybody, from rappers to record execs, were saying it's
###1445 not going to work.
###1446 How are you going to screw a record and put that worldwide?
###1449 We did it.
###1450 And it blew up.
###1451 [INAUDIBLE]
###1452 all that blew up, with Lil KeKe and them,
###1453 and the rest is history.
###1455 
###1464 TRACE: This was shot on November 14, 2000, just two
###1468 days before DJ Screw passed away of heart failure.
###1470 
###1475 So what exactly killed DJ Screw?
###1477 A lot of people tried to blame codeine.
###1479 But some people really believe that he just
###1480 worked himself to death.
###1481 [DJ SCREW TRACK]
###1487 TRAE: We on a monument right now.
###1489 This Screwed Up Records, [INAUDIBLE].
###1491 This shop means a lot.
###1493 No matter what city you come from, you could be coming from
###1496 Kansas, you could be coming from Oklahoma, anywhere, they
###1499 always come down here to get these Screw tapes.
###1501 BUN B: There's probably really only one--
###1502 I would say probably three landmarks as far that's
###1505 significant to the rap scene--
###1507 Screwed Up Records, Rap-a-Lot Records, and wherever I'm at.
###1510 [DJ SCREW TRACK]
###1512 BUN B: This is kind of like a record store.
###1513 But you can't really go and buy somebody's
###1515 album that's out.
###1518 This shit only sells Screw tapes and Screw CDs.
###1521 And they do damn good business.
###1523 They don't have to sell nobody else's shit.
###1524 They never had to.
###1526 People from all over the country, all over the world,
###1528 people show a lot of love.
###1530 [DJ SCREW TRACK]
###1535 BUN B: Screw's been gone for a couple years now.
###1537 But we keep the store going.
###1538 It's important for us to try to make sure we keep this
###1541 thing going.
###1541 I done bought every tape and every CD they
###1543 sell in here, twice.
###1544 And I'm going to keep buying them.
###1546 [DJ SCREW TRACK]
###1549 TRAE: He took a lot of us under his wing, and made us
###1551 who we are.
###1552 He molded us.
###1553 MAC NYCE: Most of the people that you seeing out here right
###1555 now, MTV, and BET, DJ Screw, he the one laid the foundation
###1560 for these cats.
###1562 From the ESGs the Flips, they going double platinum and all
###1565 this because of the foundation DJ Screw did.
###1567 [DJ SCREW TRACK]
###1571 BUN B: Screw could have made a lot more money off the tapes.
###1574 He could have been a lot more famous.
###1576 But it wasn't about him.
###1577 It was about the city.
###1578 And that's the type of shit I be trying to stretch, every
###1581 time we get to feeling our motherfucking self, or
###1583 thinking it's all about us, we got to remember that it's
###1585 never about us.
###1586 It's about the city.
###1586 It's about the hood, and the people we represent.
###1588 And that's what Screw taught us.
###1590 And that's why we hold him in such high regard.
###1592 
###1596 Screwed Up Records, or RIP DJ Screw, a real H-Town legend.
###1600 
###1607 [RAP]
###1632 KILLAHOE: New York, [INAUDIBLE] they drink.
###1634 West Coast known for they weed.
###1637 Houston, we known for our thing.
###1639 SCRIPT: This is lean oil.
###1641 It's something going put you to sleep, on your ass, if you
###1643 drink too much.
###1645 
###1648 Got many names, they call it purple stuff, call it
###1652 [INAUDIBLE].
###1654 
###1662 LANCE: It's codeine promethazine.
###1664 It's a slow drug.
###1665 It slows everything down.
###1666 I think in order to understand syrup you really have to
###1669 understand Houston.
###1670 Because Houston is a big sprawling slow hot city.
###1674 We have nine months of summer.
###1676 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###1678 
###1680 LANCE: When they say a two, a four, an eight, they're talk
###1682 about the ounces.
###1683 So a lot of people sip maybe a two each day.
###1687 Two ounces mixed into a Styrofoam cup with any kind of
###1689 soda, like strawberry soda, Sprite, anything just really,
###1692 really sweet.
###1695 KYU BOI: I fixing to get you tore up on some syrup.
###1696 This H-Town lean right here.
###1699 I'mma pour some of this out.
###1701 You ain't got to be nervous or nothing.
###1703 I know this your first time sipping, but I'm going to show
###1705 you a good time.
###1706 LANCE: It's not a drug that is consumed with an ugly use.
###1710 You don't have to tie a rubber band around your arm and shoot
###1712 anything into your arm.
###1713 You sip it out of a cup.
###1714 [MUSIC]
###1719 LANCE: I don't think it occurs to a lot of people that
###1721 there's anything really wrong with it.
###1722 MAC NYCE: It's like, to me, marijuana, drinking a beer,
###1724 having a sip of alcohol.
###1726 That's how I look at it.
###1727 KYU BOI: I'm going to show you how to mix it up.
###1729 We going to start you off with a deuce.
###1732 TRACE: How do you know how far to go down?
###1733 By how much of this you got?
###1734 KYU BOI: Yeah, how many pints you got.
###1737 AGONY LIFE: The syrup, it's part our hustle.
###1739 It's not a fad.
###1740 It's just a way of life.
###1741 Syrup been around here before y'all was born.
###1744 BIG RON: My mom and them was on drink.
###1747 They used to take a teaspoon and drink it, [INAUDIBLE].
###1749 
###1752 FREEZE: We known for it.
###1753 It's something we do.
###1754 But it's not the only place.
###1755 But we definitely did put the light on it.
###1757 KYU BOI: And then we going take this, uh, uh, uh, uh, do
###1759 this like here.
###1760 And this where the wonder starts.
###1762 Gotta have steady hands.
###1764 This is the real stuff.
###1765 TRACE: Let me give it a shot.
###1766 I'm pretty sure I can do it.
###1766 My hands are real steady.
###1769 I'm feeling good already.
###1771 It's obvious that not everyone in Houston is up on the syrup
###1774 24/7, but there's a hell of a lot of songs about it.
###1777 D ONE: (FREESTYLING) Don't hate when you see me
###1778 [INAUDIBLE]
###1779 I never coming down, still sipping on lean.
###1781 KLONDIKE KAT: See a lot of people get flack because they
###1783 say, well you do, that's all they talking
###1785 about, sipping syrup.
###1787 Everybody got their own way of putting across what they do,
###1790 or what they see in their hood.
###1792 As long as you make good music, that's how I see it.
###1794 That's the plus.
###1795 
###1799 BUN B: For the next young rappers, if they don't just
###1801 speak on some aspect of it, it's almost like they won't be
###1803 supporting the city.
###1805 Especially we got female emcees nowadays.
###1807 They going to have to in some way incorporate that kind of
###1809 shit in their shit.
###1811 And it is not sexy to see a woman sipping on syrup,
###1814 getting all fat in the fucking face, and
###1815 smoking Black and Milds.
###1817 It's a part of life.
###1818 But that shit ain't sexy.
###1822 KYU BOI: You gotta let it marinade enough.
###1823 See, that's the marination [INAUDIBLE].
###1824 
###1830 That is wonderful.
###1831 TRACE: Aw, yeah.
###1832 KYU BOI: See how that feel?
###1832 Feel good?
###1833 TRACE: It's nice in your hands?
###1835 Is it legal to drink this?
###1836 KYU BOI: Yeah, as long as the police don't catch you,
###1838 drinking, anything's legal.
###1839 TRACE: I heard a rumor that they have this strip that they
###1841 can dip into your soda and see if it has any soda.
###1843 Is that true, do you think?
###1844 FREEZE: Yeah, that's actually true.
###1845 I knew somebody they kind of got put upon them when they
###1848 caught them with a case.
###1849 And it's like a felony now.
###1850 So it's a lot of stuff out here they're trying to catch
###1852 people with.
###1853 But that's actually true.
###1854 It turns a color.
###1855 TRACE: Can I ask you a question?
###1856 Is that OK?
###1858 COP: No comment.
###1860 TRACE: That was a no comment.
###1861 KILLAHOE: It's a good and a negative thing.
###1863 Because it ain't that many of us out here on it.
###1866 But we love it.
###1867 Same time we got a lot of us that do love it.
###1869 And we going do it.
###1870 You see my white cup right here.
###1872 I'm a member of the group.
###1875 TRACE: Do we use a straw, or something?
###1876 KYU BOI: No, we don't need no straws.
###1879 Straight to the bottom.
###1880 That's the purple stuff.
###1881 Only in H-Town can you get this good stuff.
###1884 TRACE: It looks like Barney.
###1884 KB: And the negative thing is if you get too leaned out, how
###1887 you going to go in the studio and really put
###1889 down a bunch of work?
###1891 So you got to know when enough is enough.
###1893 Don't get too leaned out to where you can't take care of
###1896 your business.
###1897 Me, myself, and I, I drink lean sometimes, too.
###1899 Matter of fact, I love it.
###1901 I love it.
###1902 TRACE: I don't think you can drink it that fast anyway.
###1904 It's real--
###1904 KYU BOI: No, you can't drink it real fast.
###1905 You got to sssip.
###1907 TRACE: Actually, you start to like it after a while.
###1908 Don't you?
###1909 It really gets in your mouth like glue, doesn't it?
###1911 MO LEW: It tastes good.
###1912 It tastes real good, huh?
###1914 [INAUDIBLE] tastes real good, huh?
###1917 Tastes like Jolly Ranchers.
###1918 (EXTREMELY SLOWED DOWN) Like Jolly Ranchers.
###1921 MO LEW: I had bronchitis, so I used to give
###1923 prescriptions for it.
###1924 I hit that purple stuff, and, shit, I was ready to roll for
###1927 the rest of the week.
###1928 Hit the studio, hit the J-O-B. I was good.
###1932 TRACE: Makes you want to drink a lot more.
###1934 MAC NYCE: [INAUDIBLE]
###1934 just basically buy syrup.
###1936 We got cats who like to do the syrup and jam they screw.
###1940 But we got--
###1941 today we had cats like KB, from Street Military.
###1945 His style is completely different from the original
###1947 Screwed Up sound.
###1948 And then the Screwed Up Clique had a different style.
###1950 So it's not all just based on this one, everything's slow
###1954 and you've got to be syruped out to listen.
###1955 It ain't even like that.
###1957 
###1968 SCRIPT: Yeah, you roll some up, and sip that, it's really
###1972 a killer combination.
###1973 TRACE: Well let's do it.
###1974 I haven't smoked any pot at all.
###1975 SCRIPT: You ain't smoked no weed?
###1976 TRACE: Let's get a little bit-- let's get on the weed.
###1977 SCRIPT: You haven't smoked nothing?
###1979 Shit.
###1979 [RAP]
###1989 TRACE: The guys are just smoking weed like it's going
###1992 out of style.
###1993 God almighty, they smoke a lot of weed.
###1995 I've never been around guys smoking much pot.
###1997 [RAP]
###2008 SCRIPT: That's what I'm talking about.
###2010 Did you see how he paused and came open?
###2014 He was feeling it.
###2016 TRACE: I am.
###2016 I really am feeling it.
###2017 SCRIPT: That's what I'm talking about.
###2018 TRACE: I didn't think I would even say that.
###2019 How does the syrup make you feel?
###2021 Like there's a veil between you and the rest of the world.
###2024 And all of a sudden your whole body is warm.
###2025 [MUSIC]
###2042 TRACE: Kyu Boi asked me this morning how I slept.
###2045 KYU BOI: Shit, like a baby?
###2046 TRACE: I told him I slept like a baby.
###2047 I woke up every two hours, crying.
###2048 [LAUGHTER]
###2052 KYU BOI: That's what it do to you, man.
###2053 That's what it do to you.
