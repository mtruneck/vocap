###204 and what they achieved that is
###206 absolutely spectacular
###209 the cancer is pictures finest construction
###212 a sophisticated piece of engineering on a scale rivals anything in the ancient
###216 world
###224 for nearly two hundred years experts have been backing to understand the
###228 engineering genius behind its construction
###233 over the centuries theories have been constantly disproved and altered
###239 nobody knew who built the cat's name or what it was full
###244 the sheer logistics of building such a monument in the bleak diamond doesn't
###248 seemed impossible
###252 to have any hope of finding answers
###254 experts first have to solve even bigger mystery
###259 bit protest

###291 the battery believe that the cat's name was an ancient egyptian treasure for
###297 but modern experts have discovered clues that prove the ancient egyptians did not
###302 build
###304 they were able to identify its distinctive architecture
###308 and
###308 many of the hottest it features a greek peter's here

###327 some of the futures reflects the late afternoon mystics job
###330 found throughout the roman empire in cities like alexandria to the west of
###335 petra
###337 from this experts calculated at the cats may may have been built sometime around
###342 eighty bc
###343 nearly a thousand years
###345 as after the glory days of ancient egypt
###349 the ancient egyptians did not building sarcasm
###358 that is another theory
###362 clues line two thousand-year-old greco grumman manuscript
###367 they speak of petra
###369 the magnificent city in the desert
###371 and describe it as the home
###373 thirteen
###376 rabbit series where nomadic tax originally camp
###380 buried impotence of love
###383 it became well-known for their trading activities and their control over the
###387 trade routes
###388 than other g_m_
###389 dominated the traded incidents inspires
###393 running camel caravans across the arabian desert
###397 think about how bad not to five times
###399 just must think of few hundred camels if not thousands
###403 behind the whole this was this capital city that they don't
###406 which is that right
###410 petra was perfectly positioned at the point where several of the ancient
###413 worlds most important trade routes intersected
###419 from here than i have a chance to trade with the romans the greeks to the west
###423 the questions to the east
###424 running caravans from a radio to the mediterranean sea
###428 betrayed made him one of three
###430 and powerful
###437 the reputation of the matter to insist that they are the richest of the rich
###442 it's megabucks it's newt gingrich
###445 historians newton who never to be informed by dynastic kings
###450 and by the first century b_c_ had settled communities in the area
###455 but no one had suspected that levity ends what must have been
###458 his capable of creating a city like petra animosities that is the casting
###465 they disappeared effort
###466 in serbia
###467 four hundred since yest
###470 little of patrick has survived for more than researchers to investigate
###477 however groundbreaking new work is starting to unearth the secrets of
###481 levity in engineering
###484 the archaeology is producing extraordinary results
###488 using these results the mysteries of the cast many can be unlocked
###492 revealing the secret of its doc purpose
###494 and the great american behind its construction
###498 the one question its own spring fest
###503 how did the levity ins engineer to make a structure like the castle
###508 in the middle of the desperate
###516 petra is one of the ancient worlds most beautiful cities
###519 and the charismatic is it's crowning glory
###524 experts now where the medicines were behind its creation
###528 but this discovery provokes and even bigger ritual
###531 how a group of nomadic traders were able to construct such and engineering
###536 masterpiece
###541 did such a band appears even more astonishing one examples of only nobody
###545 an architectural taken into account
###551 advocate is that what you can see here
###554 behind that
###555 and you can see they're pretty player
###559 these basic caracas tumse have dominated by a simple design called a cruise state
###565 oaks like to staircases leading opposite directions
###570 sucrose set
###571 seems to have the
###573 all along with the most difficult type of seventeen facades
###577 but the charismatic
###578 reasoned and totally differently
###582 well than average in cities hit
###584 is different and probably more impressive than anywhere else
###590 the challenge facing the buildings was enormous
###593 experts wanted to work out how they could scale than you know veggie
###597 conclude to the height of the casting
###599 thirty-nine meters
###603 one researcher is re-examining the clintons
###606 uh... school goals
###608 uh... screw
###610 supports heat rises
###614 doctor shah heroin problem
###616 a leading expert on our picture was built
###619 is focusing on a set of slots to the sides of the casting
###624 some experts believe that these slots held scaffolding pose
###629 but in patrons rocky wilderness trees are in short supply
###636 scaffolding over thirty nine meters high it would take a foretaste form of tender
###644 doctora baba is convinced them that the tunes wouldn't have relied on such a
###648 rare commodity
###650 he investigates for that
###653 he finds that the homes are not entirely square
###657 they are in fact deeper at the base than the out of the top
###660 circumferential this tooth costs vehicle with the disease
###665 so you don't think that the
###667 where he was discourse
###669 doctor barbara has a theory
###672 i recently we're used to sarah's let's close
###675 proposed work a little bit
###678 he believes that these fortunes were carved long after the cans name was
###682 constructed
###683 perhaps during the medieval period when the sculptures of living things with
###687 being defensive
###691 this may have been when vandals beheaded in deface the figures on the cancer
###696 whether medieval or not
###697 dr obama believes the square slots had nothing to do with the construction of
###702 the cast
###709 sonar roboblogger wants to find out how i was the napa june's data access the
###713 structure
###716 he finds his own son and more tutu they had left unfinished
###721 we love our respond to all of
###723 the unfinished warm
###725 it isn't really very important to slip through
###729 this unfinished tomb unlocks the secrets of the kasinga's construction
###734 it's brings the digital's to see the replicas students use
###739 with the risk of food
###741 intersted the view was much more on the platform
###746 the evidence reveals that the builders carved not true platform out of the rock
###752 they used this platform is the lead role in which to standpoint
###756 what's more this discovery indicates a revolutionary approach to construction
###763 another tns tenant building techniques on their heads
###768 the main difference between the three standing buildings
###771 and here and bureaucrats monuments is the starting point industry standing
###776 buildings we started from
###778 the foundation
###780 but the band broke up we started from the top
###787 the buildings not constructed in the traditional fashion
###790 from the ground up
###792 it was carved out of the rock
###794 from the top
###802 dismantle builders had to start as a hike to thirty nine meters
###807 they had planned a cousin is location carefully
###811 natural com tools in the cliffs
###812 formed a narrow groups to the top of that building site
###817 the time must have been precarious
###821 in fact a simple solution may have used that way
###824 staffs cut into the rock
###828 many of these cards staircases can still be seen in the surrounding clues leading
###832 up to the cast
###841 having gained access to the construction site the hard work begins
###847 the entire job was completed in two stages
###851 first the heavy work attacking backed the uneven surface of the cliffs
###856 starting at the top of the casting
###858 the napa tns told them on the walk fast create the first working platform
###869 from here they worked on
###871 pointing the way the rafters
###872 face to create a smooth
###874 flat working centers
###878 all over the cavs met doctor rub up on
###881 has identified scars in the wrong
###885 these reveal the simple hand-held to that's required for each stage of its
###889 construction
###893 large couch stars indicate most of this work was achieved using pick ax
###899 it must have taken a month
###901 ste florio destroyed
###905 criminality and reach the bottom
###907 that blank canvas was ready to pick up
###911 the second stage beginning
###916 the builders climbed back up to the top
###919 'cause another election
###920 and began to painstakingly contradictory to fiza
###926 every cop had to be perfect
###928 if the builders made a mistake they couldn't climb back to the past
###936 gravity and stand to lose weight only made from fruit on it
###940 but they were skillfully used to shape petra soft sensed it
###947 as they work that way it's done
###949 the builders started to revealed the finished structure
###952 it was like dropping like flies stone curtain to unveil masterpiece behind
###965 but very genuine she did not end there
###969 the way in which these desert bill just dealt with the huge quantities of the
###972 greenwalds brilliantly resourceful
###976 clues from around petra reveal the secrets of the construction sites do you
###980 want at this
###982 the unwanted rock was removed and great blocks of stone
###988 trenches were cut into the lecture that bridge
###991 leaving squares of rock exposed in the middle
###995 these individuals squares with and leave it in split off their rocky base
###1000 using net trove cleavage points in the sense to them
###1004 rather than waste energy and lowering the blocks
###1007 the mapucchi and simply push them off the ledge
###1012 these great clumps of stonewalling all the way to become the building blocks
###1015 for free-standing structure is nearby
###1022 because there was both a construction site
###1024 decor
###1028 however
###1028 they stopped on construction technique did not come without a price
###1033 there was no margin for error
###1040 with a free-standing building workers to make sure the walls and columns are
###1044 strong enough
###1045 before adding the weight of the office sections on top
###1049 with a top-down technique pick up the sections a finished first
###1055 if the weight of the opposition's becomes too heavy
###1058 the entire structure could collapse on top of the workers below
###1065 for some to this building is so surprising
###1070 at mccann is a civil engineer
###1072 has been examining the structural forces within the casper
###1076 with each other thing ravages of
###1079 you realize that what they see as his is effectively a carving into the place
###1084 this when we start talking about it as a structure and how does it work is a
###1087 structure very very different to a building in the in the conventional
###1091 sense
###1092 the whole of the cancer is carved from a single piece of rock
###1100 however there is one place which could still be at risk the portico or entrance
###1104 way
###1105 that dominates the lower section
###1109 hundreds of tons of rock is suspended over this must entrance space
###1117 the solution is a massive stone lynching which spans the width of the building
###1121 and pest this weight
###1125 it sits on top of six columns
###1130 but even the columns have carved out of the cliff
###1133 while the out before i left imbedded in the rock face the central two columns
###1137 uh... free-standing
###1140 it appears as if these two columns take most of the weight
###1145 if this is the case
###1146 then the columns have difficulty absolutely straight to bear the weight
###1150 of the lentil upon
###1153 big risk
###1156 but the napkins knew how to avoid
###1163 when we look at that structure which looks like he's a little wisconsin
###1167 forcing it
###1167 i mean when you look further you realize it lynn please still fully attached to
###1171 the christmas still politics with andes invaded into the massive rock at the end
###1177 it's it's hard to imagine they even if we took the central columns away let
###1181 this thing will collapse
###1184 that is compelling evidence to support this theory
###1188 because many was heavily restored in the nineteen sixties
###1192 before this one of the central columns was missing
###1195 from nineteen th century paintings the foreman column concretely bc
###1201 even without at the casimir remained intact
###1205 the columns anot load them
###1209 berlin
###1210 in fact the entire facade is fully supported by the great cliff in which
###1214 it's it's
###1220 these discovery show that the building of the cat's name was no fluke
###1225 than other teams knew what they wanted to do
###1228 how to do it
###1230 people conscious of
###1231 absolutely every elements
###1234 before they built something like that
###1237 the construction was meticulously planned and carefully managed
###1243 refuse
###1244 there was
###1246 authority the conflicts before leaving the scope that was reportedly squad even
###1250 both also here was the supervisor here was an architect who designed the he
###1257 emphasized
###1258 through the architects sleight of hand
###1260 than other teams were able to create the appearance of a massive monumental
###1264 structure
###1265 for a fraction the engineering restaurant
###1272 few to try and build a building on this scale and i can't stand up
###1276 it would be
###1277 proceeded to him
###1279 technology and costs and so this is a cheap and effective
###1282 leading fantastic effect
###1289 the experts suggest at this time of the facade spin
###1293 but their investigation still had a long ways to go
###1298 questions remain about the interior of the cat's name and what it was full
###1304 and the structures inhospitable location praised problems with feeding and
###1308 watering such a large workforce
###1310 indus at temperatures of up to fifty degrees centigrade
###1315 but first another more pressing riddle lay before them
###1320 in spite of all their travel planning the psych the builders of chosen for the
###1323 cast may seem to suicide
###1330 the sea
###1331 camaro crack in the cliffs opposite was cut into the rock by thousands of years
###1335 of flood water surging along its parts
###1341 it could flood suddenly
###1342 and unpredictably
###1344 and the chasm and its builders lane
###1346 right in that spot
###1354 bitmap intends to use the site of the cat's name
###1357 the jewel of petra from maximum impact
###1360 directly opposite to seek
###1362 the narrow twisting gorge that form the entrance to the city
###1366 but they must have known that the sequel dot stay dry or thier rock
###1371 rainfall is a rat chicken desert environment
###1375 if you get a few inches so you get a few feet an iso
###1379 it's totally unpredictable transporting offers a hydraulic engineer
###1383 he's been studying the water management impex was barren desert
###1388 in the wet season between november to march
###1390 the rain is sometimes so heavy that the hard ground cover or soak up the water
###1397 instead it triggers destructive
###1399 flash floods
###1404 his authority of the water is the debris is carrying at that speed off the flash
###1409 floods
###1411 very destructive
###1413 the land around try is no exception
###1417 heavy rain storm
###1418 it's or on all things considered the stage
###1424 the cps patrons narrowest in august dot
###1428 hundred meters in-depth one point
###1430 two kilometers long it was called by centuries of flash flooding
###1437 during a heavy down
###1438 it was transformed into a raging torrent of water
###1441 one and a half meters d
###1443 heading straight for the charismatic
###1445 endangering the delicately carved structure
###1448 and extends
###1454 but in two thousand and two researchers discovered a complex system of towns
###1459 into thirty meters tumble excavated through the cliffs
###1467 another team builders had anticipated the danger
###1471 the tunnel was parked of an elaborate plan to deal with the sikhs destructive
###1476 hot water
###1478 but um... diverted the tolerance of flood water through the tunnel to a
###1482 nearby court bypassing c completely
###1486 it's an extraordinary achievement for engineers working two thousand years ago
###1493 they literally held back for a flat
###1497 but this wasn't just about protecting the cast me
###1501 recent archaeological work has made a dramatic breakthrough in the study of
###1505 petra
###1508 the tunnel is just one element of the finest water management system
###1516 one of the
###1516 biggest elements
###1518 in the study also have the teens knocking is
###1521 waterworks it's the hydraulic engineering
###1525 it's kaelin sophistication make it one of the greatest feats of hydraulic
###1529 engineering in the ancient world
###1533 and its efficiency was second to none
###1537 every drop is used in some way or another so what you basically have would
###1541 be a good of continuous
###1544 awards supplying throughout the year
###1547 actually perfect
###1549 to discuss this on to another
###1553 power another tns kept their work force applied with a reliable source of water
###1557 in the middle of the test
###1562 they understand
###1564 importance of
###1565 preserve the water
###1567 standing water
###1570 managing walter if you have not worked in an area like contract you die
###1576 than other teens chairs pictures location carefully to ensure they could
###1579 collect enough water for a constant supply
###1585 actually picture sits at the bottom of the patient
###1588 so if it gets water from warning of this coming into the central core of the city
###1594 as well as collecting rainwater
###1596 engineers harvested supply is from distant spring
###1600 off and i would say that uh... every spring within a fifty-mile radius of the
###1605 quarrel picture itself has been tapped
###1609 transporting water into such huge distances is a complex process
###1615 allman evidence had with terra cotta pipes
###1620 short sections of pipe
###1621 could be placed into what caused cruise
###1623 they did in with more time and the joint sealed with watertight pasta
###1629 but they're wants a problem
###1634 while more than water systems use deal that can withstand huge internal
###1638 pressures
###1639 terra cotta is much weaker
###1641 these types of relatively fragile
###1644 and a few pressurized and bill blended joints in pune
###1652 than other teams had to find a way to safely get water through the pipes
###1659 their solution can be seen the high up in the cliffs around the city
###1665 they've got to have a system
###1667 which doesn't generate significant internal pressures and once the system
###1670 is a constant great system where the war comes themselves from end to end for
###1675 constant gradient manages the forces within the pipes by controlling the flow
###1681 water
###1683 if the types of food
###1685 the flow of this water exerts huge pressure on the freemen
###1690 if there's an anika between the water and
###1693 the pressure is dramatically reduced
###1696 this is called the open channel system
###1699 at most
###1700 efficient way to get food to the pipe
###1703 is to have the plank
###1704 to a certain height
###1706 this works best when the party's eighty percent full
###1710 interest water pipes work perfectly designed to achieve this flap
###1719 banality ins got the maximum amount of water through the pacts with a minimum
###1724 amount of risk
###1727 over two thousand years ago
###1729 these ancient people was specialists in hydraulic engineering
###1735 they have massive the hydraulic principles of four weekend pipeline
###1739 systems
###1741 to indy career only matched ended twenty first century
###1749 it's one thing to collect ring and what's next
###1752 but quite another challenge to source water during the drive-ins
###1757 the solution
###1758 underground water storage
###1761 there are two hundred systems within the city
###1767 the engineering genius of the chemical pipes up off the ground is matched
###1771 underground by this complex network of systems if you look at what's retained
###1776 in the sisters you have sharp
###1779 almost supply a to sustainability corporation
###1787 what's more the scale of the water system suggests a city with a population
###1791 of fifty thousand people and functions of visiting traitors
###1796 the city was like a man-made oasis in the test
###1800 existence of god
###1803 system
###1805 everywhere you look
###1806 that is that it's beautiful to testing down from someone else
###1810 it reflected the growing ambitions of its people
###1815 monumental buildings were constructed in the city center
###1818 the great templeton trying to run the main thoroughfare
###1822 and the rock coffee otehr and magnificent royal tombs of the street a
###1826 facades
###1826 which leads down from the city's entrance under seek
###1830 one way of showing how important you are on the international scene
###1835 is to create a city which eventually everybody remembers
###1844 ivy ultimate embodiment of the netaji and success is cast
###1851 across with it's visitors
###1853 is on the explosion and displays or whilst uh... dipole workers
###1861 picket lines
###1862 right at the entrance to petra
###1864 it must have been put there
###1866 to overall visitors to the city
###1869 definitely it was
###1871 slowing off something
###1875 but surely the napkins didn't build this extraordinary monument just to impress
###1879 visitors
###1882 what's what's the purpose of the cast
###1889 the cliffs of petra pitted with rock cut structures
###1893 that function very different tomb to temple too huh
###1899 from the impressive scale of the cat's name
###1901 it was clearly built for great things the question is what
###1906 the clues lying hidden in the sculpture
###1910 the grand facade is adorned with god-like mythical figures animals and
###1915 franz and flies
###1919 that these sit in stark contrast to the usual medicare and decoration
###1925 traditionally an aba g_m_'s use geometric designs depicted records in
###1929 the arabian style
###1931 as rectangular blocks
###1933 because all of these
###1935 turning other teens
###1937 for centuries the scene
###1939 all blocks of snow
###1941 far from simple blocks of stone sculptures on the facade had been
###1945 identified as carson's
###1947 great warrior women from greek legend
###1951 the trial of crisis the egyptian goddess has been discovered in the center
###1956 what just below the head of medusa wants to have done on visitors
###1961 the cosmic is the first as far as we know
###1964 also great
###1965 facades which are full of images derived from other nations
###1970 it certainly is the greatest
###1973 finality ans gained more than just twelve from working the desert trade
###1977 groups
###1979 as they traveled across the eastern mediterranean they gathered ideas
###1983 s artistic styles and beliefs
###1986 the gods on the map in sean's eventually changed
###1990 they change appearance they are no longer just blocks of stone
###1994 the local excuse
###1996 ices aphrodite to you because of all the nations that surrounds them
###2001 and it is not just the decorations reflects an adoption of mediterranean
###2005 styles
###2008 the home facade
###2009 mimics the architecture of the classical world
###2013 i think that the
###2014 monument ality
###2017 and he
###2018 influence of egypt is definite that
###2022 abt that the entrance of the greek roman world is also present in the cosmic
###2029 it's easy to imagine how the never tns gathered these ideas spot it's less
###2033 obvious why they wanted to copy
###2038 the answer isn't relevant today as it was two thousand years ago
###2044 i look at the close of wearing
###2046 uncovering
###2048 traditional docking in close up
###2050 because he uses such and trust
###2052 very very similar at that time period
###2054 when they can't go wrong and culture
###2057 very dominant
###2060 as the militants grueling wealth of knowledge they adopted the fashion since
###2064 that day
###2072 no through applying this adopted mythology
###2075 the stories hidden inside the sculpture can be unmarked revealing vital clues
###2080 about the great buildings function
###2083 yet before he kills
###2085 without that date
###2086 assault of adds up to have an
###2089 at the sides there are six figures off that singh as always with the double
###2093 accent is but that gotten so bad that sounds
###2097 and the two figures at the base of the charismatic for to be the room and twins
###2101 castro and politics
###2103 hoop guided people's souls to the underworld
###2108 there's a very strong association was breath-taking everything almost
###2111 everything we see here
###2113 and uh... are offer clues to the cast making dedicated to the dead
###2118 dikkat access here
###2120 you could see this may seventh
###2124 call at the channel leading out tough at and this would have been for offering
###2128 sacrifices so people up about liquid kind
###2131 and see the beautiful fursat
###2133 lol cap
###2135 sacrifice which could that be

###2141 maybe is small
###2144 for the blood-letting here
###2145 habitat that guy that in the basin out there
###2149 offerings and sacrifices to the dead were an important part of the napkins
###2154 beliefs
###2156 the evidence of death and ritual tantalizing hints of the cast makes
###2160 function but they do not repeal of the buildings true purpose
###2165 it could still be at temple monument
###2168 bull too
###2171 perhaps the final terms would lie inside
###2177 but after the glories of the facade interior of the cast becomes as a
###2181 surprise
###2183 new great suite of rooms or elaborate decoration here
###2187 just a simple main chamber twelve meter square thirty meters high
###2192 with to side rooms at the front
###2200 the task of creating them without modern technology is almost unimaginative
###2206 the scene sign it would have been horrendous the absolute with choking
###2210 dust
###2213 the burials origins vertical on
###2217 conditioner lol result
###2222 only small oil lamps contribute fairways staked went into the heart of the
###2226 clinton
###2228 bedrooms for this telescope just iron pics chisels
###2232 and that that happens
###2235 the chambers were carved using the same top dog technique is the outside facade
###2242 when the covers reach the level below the great clinton work started on the in
###2246 their homes
###2248 but on one was cut directly into the truth
###2251 and was white to create the portico behind the columns
###2255 from this further troubles will cut to create the roofs of the changes
###2261 the only clues to discover technique to windows above the doorways which served
###2265 as the first time entrances
###2270 then this work continues on the facade
###2272 and it's working platform dropped dot on the plane
###2275 the floors of the chambers forward
###2278 apocalyptic on
###2280 goes on to six carl
###2284 propose four-wheel warped problems for you because
###2289 foreign and gunshot to start doing six thousand cubic meters of rock from the
###2293 chamber
###2294 the equivalent of two olympic swimming pool
###2297 filled with stones
###2299 it's an incredible achievement
###2306 but hard labor was not the only secret of their success
###2309 despite its simplicity of the chamber required careful engineering
###2317 above it lies the crushing force of more than a hundred and sixty meters of solid
###2322 rock
###2324 he's got a great deal of saying about you
###2327 tens of millions of world all of which all whiting down on top of this whole
###2333 and there loads have to be transmitted somewhere and what happens is that the
###2337 loads will follow the stiffest cost-effectively the loads pushing
###2341 around the side
###2343 off the kinds of most of the senate yes
###2345 the problem comes if the chamber is made too wide
###2350 they're going to love the bars would not be able to my kids loggia anywhere on
###2354 the side person in the middle east
###2357 breakthrough like that
###2359 than other students clearly understood the limits of their design
###2362 they kept the interior chambers small enough to prevent a catastrophic ruth
###2374 but the simplicity of the interior space gave archaeologists no clues to the
###2379 callousness religious function
###2382 quite a lot of speculations about uh... what this has been
###2386 there have been was at the temple
###2388 but it does not
###2391 the correct divisions
###2395 another weather was it's just too
###2397 again
###2400 arnaz sides of mario's in there
###2403 the interior has no trace of a better no sarcophagus
###2407 new clean where one would have stored
###2411 without any signs of a bloody it could not be a too
###2416 perhaps the kashmir was a monument on during the great king
###2421 presently s
###2423 such large scale it's mustn't be invoked by somebody extremely wealthy and
###2427 powerful
###2428 must have been picking
###2432 this is another question
###2434 archaeologists were only able to take the casting to a rough
###2437 four hundred and fifty year winter on the birth of christ
###2441 and during this period
###2443 any of several liberty and kings could've built the structure
###2449 with no further needs to follow it seems like as maze true purpose would never be
###2454 discovered
###2461 but then archaeologists made a startling breakthrough
###2466 in nineteen ninety-six they found evidence that the ground level in front
###2469 of the casket was much lower in netaji and time
###2474 declared one-man on a journey of underground exploration to find what
###2479 lies beneath and to unlock the kashmiris last secret
###2487 why the new evidence proof that hasn't has remained a mystery for centuries
###2493 no groundbreaking new discovery his revealed crucial clues to its true
###2497 purpose
###2499 ebbing
###2499 discoveries in excavations but nothing quite as important is this particular
###2504 one
###2505 it's excavations act
###2507 more informations for this beautiful and unique we'll make it happen
