0:0:3,56 --> 0:0:12,3
Let's welcome Phil Libin.


2
0:0:12,3 --> 0:0:12,86
Thank you so much.


3
0:0:12,86 --> 0:0:18,1
One of the things we made Evernote for was a - as an easy way


4
0:0:18,1 --> 0:0:21,32
to capture all of the most memorable moments in your life,


5
0:0:21,32 --> 0:0:26,36
so if you guys just hold on here a sec.


6
0:0:26,36 --> 0:0:30,45
And now I remember this which is pretty cool.


7
0:0:30,45 --> 0:0:35,12
I actually did this little bit with taking


8
0:0:35,12 --> 0:0:36,94
a picture of a crowd with a cell phone.


9
0:0:36,94 --> 0:0:38,9
It kind of was a gag for the first time


10
0:0:38,9 --> 0:0:40,46
it was my very first press conference.


11
0:0:40,46 --> 0:0:43,32
We were in Japan and we had a new press conference before,


12
0:0:43,32 --> 0:0:45,344
but I guess in Japan, they still do them


13
0:0:45,344 --> 0:0:47,61
and there were hundreds of hundreds of reporters that


14
0:0:47,61 --> 0:0:50,5
showed up and I got up on stage and there was literally like just a wall


15
0:0:50,5 --> 0:0:53,1
of flashes because I guess this is what they will do in Japan and I was


16
0:0:53,1 --> 0:0:56,16
kind of taking it back and I just took up my phone and took a picture


17
0:0:56,16 --> 0:0:59,8
of the crowd and the way back and I kind of broke the ice and got everyone


18
0:0:59,8 --> 0:1:1,95
laughing and I just - I happened to do it at Evernote,


19
0:1:1,95 --> 0:1:4,349
because that's the app that I had one at the time.


20
0:1:4,349 --> 0:1:5,84
And so it kind of started as a joke,


21
0:1:5,84 --> 0:1:8,2
but then it actually turned out to be something I do all the time now


22
0:1:8,2 --> 0:1:11,33
because it's actually really cool where you have this memory of what you


23
0:1:11,33 --> 0:1:16,49
all look like before I bored you for the next hour with this talk.


24
0:1:16,49 --> 0:1:21,3
So I was asked to come in and talk about


25
0:1:21,3 --> 0:1:24,42
being an entrepreneur and I figured okay,


26
0:1:24,42 --> 0:1:28,69
well that's Phil Libin's standard talk number 17/B.


27
0:1:28,69 --> 0:1:32,338
I don't really have to think much about how to do that.


28
0:1:32,338 --> 0:1:34,23
And my original plan was to just come in here and basically


29
0:1:34,23 --> 0:1:37,58
say the same stuff that I've said to a bunch of audiences


30
0:1:37,58 --> 0:1:38,88
interested about entrepreneurship,


31
0:1:38,88 --> 0:1:42,33
you know, stay in school and follow your dream and embrace


32
0:1:42,33 --> 0:1:44,7
failure and now is the best time in the history of the


33
0:1:44,7 --> 0:1:48,81
world to start a company and all that stuff.


34
0:1:48,81 --> 0:1:52,27
But somehow I couldn't quite bring myself to do it,


35
0:1:52,27 --> 0:1:54,33
because in the past week,


36
0:1:54,33 --> 0:1:57,49
I think like most of you or like many of you,


37
0:1:57,49 --> 0:2:0,16
I've spent a lot of time thinking about Steve Jobs


38
0:2:0,16 --> 0:2:3,45
and all of a sudden I realize that the general


39
0:2:3,45 --> 0:2:6,64
platitude how to be an entrepreneur speech,


40
0:2:6,64 --> 0:2:9,79
it's very hard to add anything to what he has already said.


41
0:2:9,79 --> 0:2:14,47
I went back and I watched Steve Jobs' Stanford address from 2005,


42
0:2:14,47 --> 0:2:16,7
which again all of you have probably seen in the past few


43
0:2:16,7 --> 0:2:20,15
days and that is just an extraordinary speech, right.


44
0:2:20,15 --> 0:2:23,1
It is the Apple of commencement addresses.


45
0:2:23,1 --> 0:2:26,9
Most of the ideas in it actually aren't the


46
0:2:26,9 --> 0:2:28,16
first time we ever heard those, right.


47
0:2:28,16 --> 0:2:30,8
There is a lot of things in that speech that


48
0:2:30,8 --> 0:2:32,8
almost everyone's probably heard before,


49
0:2:32,8 --> 0:2:33,8
but the execution is just flawless, right.


50
0:2:33,8 --> 0:2:36,13
It's just perfectly put together, perfectly expressed.


51
0:2:36,13 --> 0:2:39,38
Flawless and it just carried so much weight because of it,


52
0:2:39,38 --> 0:2:42,98
but it was the follow your dream speech and


53
0:2:42,98 --> 0:2:44,96
I thought there is no way - I can't add to that.


54
0:2:44,96 --> 0:2:46,44
It can't be better than that,


55
0:2:46,44 --> 0:2:49,14
because that's already been done as perfectly as


56
0:2:49,14 --> 0:2:51,86
it's ever going to - as it's ever going to be done.


57
0:2:51,86 --> 0:2:55,5
So it made me think that I should kind of throw my standard


58
0:2:55,5 --> 0:2:56,69
entrepreneurship talk out of the window and try to do


59
0:2:56,69 --> 0:3:0,12
something that maybe expands on this topic a little bit


60
0:3:0,12 --> 0:3:2,56
more and the more I started thinking about it,


61
0:3:2,56 --> 0:3:5,69
the more I realized that well,


62
0:3:5,69 --> 0:3:10,18
the only thing that I can think of to maybe add to it is,


63
0:3:10,18 --> 0:3:11,37
this whole follow your dream,


64
0:3:11,37 --> 0:3:15,15
like that's all built well and good and it's very profound


65
0:3:15,15 --> 0:3:17,7
and was very well stated but it really doesn't answer


66
0:3:17,7 --> 0:3:20,26
the question of well what's the right dream.


67
0:3:20,26 --> 0:3:24,16
How do you dream the right thing.


68
0:3:24,16 --> 0:3:28,243
Because obviously the world is extremely lucky that Steve Jobs


69
0:3:28,243 --> 0:3:30,96
followed his dream and that Martin Luther King followed


70
0:3:30,96 --> 0:3:33,73
his dream and that Beethoven followed this dream,


71
0:3:33,73 --> 0:3:36,22
but those people also have pretty good dreams,


72
0:3:36,22 --> 0:3:40,33
Snooki is probably also following her dream and


73
0:3:40,33 --> 0:3:44,8
so I don't know if that's self sufficient.


74
0:3:44,8 --> 0:3:46,17
And it's actually something I realized I've been thinking


75
0:3:46,17 --> 0:3:50,37
about for my whole life is what is the goal?


76
0:3:50,37 --> 0:3:52,48
What is the meaning of it? What is the dream to have?


77
0:3:52,48 --> 0:3:55,97
Like, yeah, once I figure out what's my dream,


78
0:3:55,97 --> 0:3:57,88
once I have a suitably epic dream,


79
0:3:57,88 --> 0:4:1,24
then I think it's all well and good to say I'm just going


80
0:4:1,24 --> 0:4:3,46
to follow it to its logical conclusion and have a great


81
0:4:3,46 --> 0:4:6,62
time and hopefully put a dent in the universe,


82
0:4:6,62 --> 0:4:9,22
but I couldn't for a very long time figure out what a suitably


83
0:4:9,22 --> 0:4:13,55
epic dream would be and so I wanted to share kind of before


84
0:4:13,55 --> 0:4:16,44
we get to the standard entrepreneurship stuff,


85
0:4:16,44 --> 0:4:19,76
the thought process that led me to this very specific vision


86
0:4:19,76 --> 0:4:23,49
of what I wanted to accomplish and why I think being an entrepreneur


87
0:4:23,49 --> 0:4:28,52
is the most direct path to accomplishing it.


88
0:4:28,52 --> 0:4:32,34
So I started out - this is kind of a philosophical question right,


89
0:4:32,34 --> 0:4:36,9
what is a suitable dream to have in your life, a suitable goal.


90
0:4:36,9 --> 0:4:41,1
And it makes me think of the very first philosophical thought


91
0:4:41,1 --> 0:4:43,4
that I was aware of ever having like I kind of distinctively


92
0:4:43,4 --> 0:4:45,79
have this memory from when I was a little kid and it was the


93
0:4:45,79 --> 0:4:49,21
first time that I probably thought - had an abstract thought


94
0:4:49,21 --> 0:4:51,31
and I forget how old I was but I was in Russia,


95
0:4:51,31 --> 0:4:54,38
I was born in Russia and I was probably five or may be six or


96
0:4:54,38 --> 0:4:58,9
something and we had gone on some trip with my family and


97
0:4:58,9 --> 0:5:1,64
I really loved it and I think maybe we were like two weeks away


98
0:5:1,64 --> 0:5:5,39
in some nice place and I was really having a great time.


99
0:5:5,39 --> 0:5:7,8
And then it was time to leave, it was the last day,


100
0:5:7,8 --> 0:5:10,79
it was time to go back and I remember talking to my mom saying,


101
0:5:10,79 --> 0:5:12,26
I don't want to leave.


102
0:5:12,26 --> 0:5:14,24
This is really great. I don't want to go back home.


103
0:5:14,24 --> 0:5:16,84
I want this - I just want to stay here.


104
0:5:16,84 --> 0:5:19,6
And she said, well, you can't, our vacation is over.


105
0:5:19,6 --> 0:5:21,3
And I said, well, why does it - why does it have to end?


106
0:5:21,3 --> 0:5:22,6
Why does it have to be over?


107
0:5:22,6 --> 0:5:24,75
And she said, well everything, everything ends.


108
0:5:24,75 --> 0:5:27,11
And I remember being struck by that when I was five.


109
0:5:27,11 --> 0:5:29,33
Remember that idea that well everything ends is what


110
0:5:29,33 --> 0:5:31,55
something that was kind of non-trivial to me.


111
0:5:31,55 --> 0:5:33,9
I never thought of it that way before.


112
0:5:33,9 --> 0:5:36,94
And I thought well, what do you mean? You mean really everything?


113
0:5:36,94 --> 0:5:40,21
And she said, yeah, everything. This vacation will end.


114
0:5:40,21 --> 0:5:42,3
The summer will end, the year will end. Everything ends.


115
0:5:42,3 --> 0:5:45,36
And I remember thinking like well,


116
0:5:45,36 --> 0:5:47,88
obviously I made the next logical leap for a five-year old,


117
0:5:47,88 --> 0:5:50,26
I said, well, is the world going to end?


118
0:5:50,26 --> 0:5:53,89
And she said, yeah, at some point probably the world will end.


119
0:5:53,89 --> 0:5:56,92
And this is what really fascinated me.


120
0:5:56,92 --> 0:5:59,12
I was a little five-year old nerd and I immediately


121
0:5:59,12 --> 0:6:4,691
filled up with the idea of the world ending.


122
0:6:4,691 --> 0:6:6,49
Probably because it would mean that like I wouldn't


123
0:6:6,49 --> 0:6:8,35
have to keep playing soccer in the soccer club that


124
0:6:8,35 --> 0:6:11,76
I hated and they tried to enroll me into something.


125
0:6:11,76 --> 0:6:13,94
And I spent the next several years thinking about that


126
0:6:13,94 --> 0:6:16,34
and wondering and kind of obsessing in a creepy little


127
0:6:16,34 --> 0:6:19,7
kid obsessed way about the end of the world.


128
0:6:19,7 --> 0:6:21,59
And I - of course, I had no idea how it would happen,


129
0:6:21,59 --> 0:6:23,62
but I remember one of the first movies I saw was this


130
0:6:23,62 --> 0:6:27,71
horror movie about dinosaurs and there was a dinosaurs


131
0:6:27,71 --> 0:6:30,69
that somehow woken up and started eating people.


132
0:6:30,69 --> 0:6:32,15
And that point I figured okay,


133
0:6:32,15 --> 0:6:34,77
well, the world will probably end from dinosaurs.


134
0:6:34,77 --> 0:6:37,27
Dinosaurs will probably come and eat all of us and I kind of


135
0:6:37,27 --> 0:6:41,488
became an expert on the end of the world through dinosaurs.


136
0:6:41,488 --> 0:6:45,368
And then I went to my parents,


137
0:6:45,368 --> 0:6:47,8
and I said, well do you think it's going to be dinosaurs?


138
0:6:47,8 --> 0:6:48,64
Like what are you talking about?


139
0:6:48,64 --> 0:6:52,3
Well, the end of the world, that's what I'm always talking about.


140
0:6:52,3 --> 0:6:53,18
Do you think it's going to be dinosaurs?


141
0:6:53,18 --> 0:6:53,97
They said no, it's not going to be -


142
0:6:53,97 --> 0:6:56,3
probably not going to be dinosaurs.


143
0:6:56,3 --> 0:6:57,4
What's it going to be?


144
0:6:57,4 --> 0:6:58,51
And I think at that point I was probably seven or


145
0:6:58,51 --> 0:7:0,39
eight and I was just old enough where they felt they


146
0:7:0,39 --> 0:7:1,81
should just tell me the truth which was again,


147
0:7:1,81 --> 0:7:3,81
this was in the late 70s, early 80s and they said,


148
0:7:3,81 --> 0:7:6,9
no, it's probably going to be nuclear war.


149
0:7:6,9 --> 0:7:10,1
Realistically, back then just about everyone


150
0:7:10,1 --> 0:7:13,2
thought that the world would end in 10 years,


151
0:7:13,2 --> 0:7:16,75
20 years, but either us and that point the Soviet Union or the U.S.


152
0:7:16,75 --> 0:7:18,79
would initiate a nuclear war and that would


153
0:7:18,79 --> 0:7:19,51
probably be the end of the world.


154
0:7:19,51 --> 0:7:22,72
So that was kind of my first realistic thought about it.


155
0:7:22,72 --> 0:7:25,85
And then we emigrated to the U.S.


156
0:7:25,85 --> 0:7:27,52
and so I got this kind of see it from the other side,


157
0:7:27,52 --> 0:7:30,72
but even in the U.S. most people in the early 80s I think thought


158
0:7:30,72 --> 0:7:34,36
that the missiles were imminent. The world was going to end.


159
0:7:34,36 --> 0:7:38,17
And I was really kind of - I was really focused on that.


160
0:7:38,17 --> 0:7:40,17
And to learn English, I did a lot of reading.


161
0:7:40,17 --> 0:7:41,95
I came here when I was eight years old and I learned


162
0:7:41,95 --> 0:7:43,9
English basically by reading comic books.


163
0:7:43,9 --> 0:7:48,99
I read a lot of Thor comic books and I just - I read all sorts of geek,


164
0:7:48,99 --> 0:7:56,15
sci-fi and fantasy stuff and I kept seeing these stories about superheroes


165
0:7:56,15 --> 0:7:59,18
and Gods and monsters and the end of the world and Norse Mythology and


166
0:7:59,18 --> 0:8:6,695
Thor and Geek Mythology and how they thought it would happen.


167
0:8:6,695 --> 0:8:9,12
And then I read something which was kind


168
0:8:9,12 --> 0:8:10,3
of the second thing that stuck with me,


169
0:8:10,3 --> 0:8:13,91
which was - it's from Genesis from the Bible,


170
0:8:13,91 --> 0:8:15,2
but I'm pretty sure you didn't read it in the Bible


171
0:8:15,2 --> 0:8:18,255
and probably read it in Spiderman or something.


172
0:8:18,255 --> 0:8:23,12
But it was this idea that God created us in his image right.


173
0:8:23,12 --> 0:8:24,29
This line that everyone thought,


174
0:8:24,29 --> 0:8:28,11
God made us and made people in his image and I remember thinking


175
0:8:28,11 --> 0:8:31,16
now that's a really interesting idea like what does that mean,


176
0:8:31,16 --> 0:8:33,9
like whether you believe in it or not that didn't really matter,


177
0:8:33,9 --> 0:8:36,24
I thought what is this - it sort of - it's kind of an interesting thing,


178
0:8:36,24 --> 0:8:39,8
God made us in his image. What does that mean?


179
0:8:39,8 --> 0:8:44,1
Does that mean that God is kind of a fat guy with a beard? Probably.


180
0:8:44,1 --> 0:8:45,9
But this probably also means something else,


181
0:8:45,9 --> 0:8:47,3
something else that's more interesting and so


182
0:8:47,3 --> 0:8:49,46
I started thinking well what could it mean?


183
0:8:49,46 --> 0:8:53,62
What is maybe something that is more inherently and essentially


184
0:8:53,62 --> 0:8:58,15
part of people's idea of God and maybe it's that essential


185
0:8:58,15 --> 0:9:1,68
quality that mankind is made in the image.


186
0:9:1,68 --> 0:9:3,21
So maybe it's not a physical resemblance,


187
0:9:3,21 --> 0:9:6,53
maybe it's some kind of a - some kind of an inherent quality that


188
0:9:6,53 --> 0:9:9,38
people ascribe to God and that's the part that we have,


189
0:9:9,38 --> 0:9:10,83
that's in our image.


190
0:9:10,83 --> 0:9:13,66
And some point later probably in high school,


191
0:9:13,66 --> 0:9:17,7
I came upon this idea of transcendence and that this was


192
0:9:17,7 --> 0:9:20,54
actually the central thing that many religions and many


193
0:9:20,54 --> 0:9:23,89
philosophies subscribed to God was this idea of transcendence


194
0:9:23,89 --> 0:9:27,18
that God was there before the beginning,


195
0:9:27,18 --> 0:9:29,1
and God will be there after the end that He sort of


196
0:9:29,1 --> 0:9:32,44
transcends whatever bubble of reality we live in.


197
0:9:32,44 --> 0:9:35,1
And that, of course, dovetailed perfectly with my whole sick


198
0:9:35,1 --> 0:9:37,39
end-of-the-world fixation and I thought,


199
0:9:37,39 --> 0:9:40,61
okay, that's something deep at least,


200
0:9:40,61 --> 0:9:42,87
you know, for what passed for deep in high school,


201
0:9:42,87 --> 0:9:45,25
you know, was also listening to Wham!


202
0:9:45,25 --> 0:9:49,24
or whatever. Actually, Dio probably;


203
0:9:49,24 --> 0:9:52,69
I was more of a metalhead back then.


204
0:9:52,69 --> 0:9:54,13
And, I thought this is interesting, right?


205
0:9:54,13 --> 0:9:58,45
This is maybe the central idea is transcendence, right?


206
0:9:58,45 --> 0:10:1,32
This is what God means. And, I wasn't saying this in a religious way.


207
0:10:1,32 --> 0:10:3,16
I wasn't ever particularly religious,


208
0:10:3,16 --> 0:10:6,65
but I thought the idea of transcendence is a really fascinating one.


209
0:10:6,65 --> 0:10:8,15
The idea that you - yes,


210
0:10:8,15 --> 0:10:10,87
every - there is a start and an end to everything


211
0:10:10,87 --> 0:10:14,3
but some things transcend that.


212
0:10:14,3 --> 0:10:18,8
And, I was really fixated on this idea of transcendence and


213
0:10:18,8 --> 0:10:21,82
this got me beaten up a lot in school because it wasn't


214
0:10:21,82 --> 0:10:26,64
a particular - particularly popular topic of conversation.


215
0:10:26,64 --> 0:10:28,63
Basically, I was such a giant nerd that -


216
0:10:28,63 --> 0:10:30,83
I am not kidding - in high school,


217
0:10:30,83 --> 0:10:34,31
the chess team would not hang out with me.


218
0:10:34,31 --> 0:10:37,91
Like, literally, the chess team would not hang out with me.


219
0:10:37,91 --> 0:10:40,96
The computer club hung out with me but I was


220
0:10:40,96 --> 0:10:45,66
not nearly cool enough for the chess team.


221
0:10:45,66 --> 0:10:50,37
So, when I got to thinking about how the world actually would end for


222
0:10:50,37 --> 0:10:53,26
real after it became hopefully clear that it wasn't really going to


223
0:10:53,26 --> 0:10:56,34
be in the next five years because of dinosaurs and nuclear war,


224
0:10:56,34 --> 0:10:58,4
I thought, okay, well, but really it will end at some point.


225
0:10:58,4 --> 0:10:59,33
So, how is that going to happen, right?


226
0:10:59,33 --> 0:11:1,99
So, I started reading basically everyone


227
0:11:1,99 --> 0:11:3,18
I could on the subject, right?


228
0:11:3,18 --> 0:11:5,52
Gould and Dawkins and everyone else, right?


229
0:11:5,52 --> 0:11:7,22
There is lots of theories about how


230
0:11:7,22 --> 0:11:11,67
things are going to go down, right? So, an asteroid impact, right?


231
0:11:11,67 --> 0:11:14,34
There was Carl Sagan who was writing about this where there is actually


232
0:11:14,34 --> 0:11:17,24
mathematically extremely high percentage that we will have an asteroid


233
0:11:17,24 --> 0:11:21,32
impact that will destroy the entire planet or all life on it and,


234
0:11:21,32 --> 0:11:23,63
you know, it happens every couple of hundred thousand years


235
0:11:23,63 --> 0:11:26,15
and just because it doesn't happen in mankind's memory was


236
0:11:26,15 --> 0:11:29,13
exactly because mankind came around after the last time it


237
0:11:29,13 --> 0:11:31,56
happened but that doesn't mean it won't happen again.


238
0:11:31,56 --> 0:11:33,38
And, of course, there is, you know - there is viruses.


239
0:11:33,38 --> 0:11:36,34
There's all sorts of stuff. At some point, the sun will burn out.


240
0:11:36,34 --> 0:11:39,63
At some point after that, the whole galaxy will collapse.


241
0:11:39,63 --> 0:11:41,82
So, there are actually interesting ways


242
0:11:41,82 --> 0:11:43,11
to think about how the world will end.


243
0:11:43,11 --> 0:11:44,89
We're probably - hopefully, we're not talking about decades,


244
0:11:44,89 --> 0:11:46,48
maybe talking about thousands or ten thousands of


245
0:11:46,48 --> 0:11:50,1
hundreds of thousands of years and I combined that


246
0:11:50,1 --> 0:11:52,35
with this idea of transcendence and I thought,


247
0:11:52,35 --> 0:11:54,41
well, this is actually kind of cool, right?


248
0:11:54,41 --> 0:11:59,1
Maybe the way in which humans are made in God's image,


249
0:11:59,1 --> 0:12:0,2
in this image of transcendence,


250
0:12:0,2 --> 0:12:4,14
is maybe we have the spark that we have a chance to actually


251
0:12:4,14 --> 0:12:9,72
transcend the natural way that otherwise the world would end,


252
0:12:9,72 --> 0:12:11,46
all life would be destroyed, and so on.


253
0:12:11,46 --> 0:12:13,8
So, if we didn't do anything,


254
0:12:13,8 --> 0:12:15,75
obviously, there is a very good chance that whatever the end is,


255
0:12:15,75 --> 0:12:17,44
people would have brought it about ourselves.


256
0:12:17,44 --> 0:12:20,75
We would kill ourselves off through pollution


257
0:12:20,75 --> 0:12:21,86
or overpopulation or something.


258
0:12:21,86 --> 0:12:26,86
And so, there was a goal of not doing that and for a while


259
0:12:26,86 --> 0:12:28,52
that was - kind of became my goal in life, it was.


260
0:12:28,52 --> 0:12:31,3
I said, okay, I'm going to be basically an environmentalist, right?


261
0:12:31,3 --> 0:12:34,78
I am going to try to prevent mankind destroying the planet.


262
0:12:34,78 --> 0:12:37,35
But, then I realized, well, even if we don't do anything,


263
0:12:37,35 --> 0:12:38,47
it's still going to end.


264
0:12:38,47 --> 0:12:39,88
It's just a matter of time,


265
0:12:39,88 --> 0:12:42,8
like if we were - if there were basically no people;


266
0:12:42,8 --> 0:12:44,24
if, you know, chimpanzees were the highest organism,


267
0:12:44,24 --> 0:12:45,96
very similar to ours,


268
0:12:45,96 --> 0:12:48,57
and you can argue that the same kind of emotion and


269
0:12:48,57 --> 0:12:51,28
a very similar intelligence but there was no pollution or


270
0:12:51,28 --> 0:12:53,75
anything that wouldn't save all life on the planet.


271
0:12:53,75 --> 0:12:56,98
It would still all get wiped out the next meteor impact or something.


272
0:12:56,98 --> 0:13:1,57
In fact, the only way that it was even a slight likelihood of that -


273
0:13:1,57 --> 0:13:4,97
of the planet or life on it transcending that event was people,


274
0:13:4,97 --> 0:13:6,75
was if we actually got our acts together


275
0:13:6,75 --> 0:13:9,81
enough to do something about it.


276
0:13:9,81 --> 0:13:16,67
So, we - mankind would have to actually organize and get our act together


277
0:13:16,67 --> 0:13:20,54
in such a way that we advanced forward in technology but did in a


278
0:13:20,54 --> 0:13:23,94
way that didn't cause the end of all life prematurely by us just


279
0:13:23,94 --> 0:13:26,97
being stupid and nuking ourselves or polluting the planet.


280
0:13:26,97 --> 0:13:28,11
But, at the same time,


281
0:13:28,11 --> 0:13:30,22
we got advanced enough quickly enough where we actually had


282
0:13:30,22 --> 0:13:35,77
the wherewithal to avert or transcend or live through an ever-increasing


283
0:13:35,77 --> 0:13:39,34
series of mathematically likely threats,


284
0:13:39,34 --> 0:13:42,91
going - spanning thousands and even millions of years into the future.


285
0:13:42,91 --> 0:13:46,31
It's kind of an egghead idea but I thought that's like a good


286
0:13:46,31 --> 0:13:49,31
definition to me of what it means to be in God's image,


287
0:13:49,31 --> 0:13:51,49
right, to be transcendent.


288
0:13:51,49 --> 0:13:55,27
And of course, we wouldn't - it wouldn't just be about saving us.


289
0:13:55,27 --> 0:13:59,34
There is a great scene in Futurama, right, where Bender,


290
0:13:59,34 --> 0:14:2,23
it's the robot and he's in a van with the rest of the characters


291
0:14:2,23 --> 0:14:5,57
and the van goes over a - goes over the cliff and they are plummeting


292
0:14:5,57 --> 0:14:7,54
and everyone is yelling and Bender goes,


293
0:14:7,54 --> 0:14:11,75
"I'll save me!" and he, like, stretches his arms out to save himself.


294
0:14:11,75 --> 0:14:15,6
So, this isn't just about saving us, saving humanity, right.


295
0:14:15,6 --> 0:14:18,55
But, it is very much about saving the whales,


296
0:14:18,55 --> 0:14:20,5
like they did on Star Trek IV, right.


297
0:14:20,5 --> 0:14:23,22
Like, if the whales are going to survive, we have to do it.


298
0:14:23,22 --> 0:14:25,68
They are not going to get by on their own, right?


299
0:14:25,68 --> 0:14:27,56
The only way they can actually survive


300
0:14:27,56 --> 0:14:30,75
in the long term is through people.


301
0:14:30,75 --> 0:14:33,93
And so, I thought - this was around high school;


302
0:14:33,93 --> 0:14:35,2
I put these things together and I said,


303
0:14:35,2 --> 0:14:38,88
okay, that's a big enough dream for me.


304
0:14:38,88 --> 0:14:43,3
Like, I want to work towards getting humanity to the point


305
0:14:43,3 --> 0:14:46,94
where we can survive and guarantee the survival of us and


306
0:14:46,94 --> 0:14:51,21
of life and of intelligence for millions of years, right?


307
0:14:51,21 --> 0:14:53,84
Like that was sufficiently epoch and I thought okay,


308
0:14:53,84 --> 0:14:59,465
now I've got something. But, it wasn't exactly actionable.


309
0:14:59,465 --> 0:15:0,78
I couldn't quite figure out a way to


310
0:15:0,78 --> 0:15:5,7
actually do that in a meaningful way.


311
0:15:5,7 --> 0:15:5,99
So, I just continued,


312
0:15:5,99 --> 0:15:7,57
you know, kind of being a nerd and reading a lot of


313
0:15:7,57 --> 0:15:12,66
sci-fi and fantasy and when I got my - after college,


314
0:15:12,66 --> 0:15:15,68
I got a job and I was working with a few friends


315
0:15:15,68 --> 0:15:18,1
of mine in Boston as a software engineer.


316
0:15:18,1 --> 0:15:19,9
So, I am a programmer by training and I got


317
0:15:19,9 --> 0:15:23,471
a job at a company in Boston called ATG, the Art Technology Group.


318
0:15:23,471 --> 0:15:24,2
That's what it was called at the time.


319
0:15:24,2 --> 0:15:27,22
I think it has since been bought by Oracle a couple of years ago.


320
0:15:27,22 --> 0:15:29,26
And, ATG was this amazing company.


321
0:15:29,26 --> 0:15:33,41
I joined them right before they IPOed and we built -


322
0:15:33,41 --> 0:15:35,31
we just built all this awesome technology.


323
0:15:35,31 --> 0:15:37,16
We invented a lot of the stuff that you just


324
0:15:37,16 --> 0:15:38,43
sort of take for granted on the Internet,


325
0:15:38,43 --> 0:15:41,38
like dynamic web pages and stuff like that.


326
0:15:41,38 --> 0:15:45,4
This was in the late '90s.


327
0:15:45,4 --> 0:15:48,27
And, I had this phenomenal experience at ATG,


328
0:15:48,27 --> 0:15:51,97
which is for - up to now at every point in my life,


329
0:15:51,97 --> 0:15:53,9
I was sort of used to feeling like


330
0:15:53,9 --> 0:15:56,56
I was the smartest person in the room,


331
0:15:56,56 --> 0:15:58,14
totally not, just to fight obviously.


332
0:15:58,14 --> 0:15:59,97
But that was the feeling I had, right?


333
0:15:59,97 --> 0:16:3,94
I was this kind of the snotty, nerdish kid and I always felt that,


334
0:16:3,94 --> 0:16:6,6
like, I was always the smartest person


335
0:16:6,6 --> 0:16:7,36
in the room pretty much all the time.


336
0:16:7,36 --> 0:16:8,61
Yeah, yeah, sure, the other kids had


337
0:16:8,61 --> 0:16:12,35
girlfriends and were good at sports.


338
0:16:12,35 --> 0:16:15,73
But, I always got the sense that I was the smartest person.


339
0:16:15,73 --> 0:16:19,17
And, at ATG that was the first time where that was patently not true,


340
0:16:19,17 --> 0:16:21,81
where like even somebody like me could look around and be like man,


341
0:16:21,81 --> 0:16:23,94
I suck, I am below average here.


342
0:16:23,94 --> 0:16:26,21
Like, this is a brilliant group of people,


343
0:16:26,21 --> 0:16:28,14
a brilliant group of developers and engineers,


344
0:16:28,14 --> 0:16:30,26
and they are getting stuff done in an amazing way,


345
0:16:30,26 --> 0:16:32,27
and I am like I am in awe of this team,


346
0:16:32,27 --> 0:16:34,5
and I frankly was below average.


347
0:16:34,5 --> 0:16:35,8
Like, I kind of got the feeling that,


348
0:16:35,8 --> 0:16:37,96
like, they were putting up with me because I was,


349
0:16:37,96 --> 0:16:39,91
like, I was just worth it to put up with.


350
0:16:39,91 --> 0:16:42,0
But, I certainly wasn't one of the star developers,


351
0:16:42,0 --> 0:16:44,57
one of the star programmers. Their other people were.


352
0:16:44,57 --> 0:16:47,5
And, I had this - when I first realized this,


353
0:16:47,5 --> 0:16:49,5
first, it really troubled me, you know, greatly.


354
0:16:49,5 --> 0:16:52,33
But, then I realized this is awesome.


355
0:16:52,33 --> 0:16:55,87
This is like the first time I'm ever really enjoying myself.


356
0:16:55,87 --> 0:16:59,81
This is the first time where I felt like the environment


357
0:16:59,81 --> 0:17:2,6
that I was in that I lucked into by joining this company,


358
0:17:2,6 --> 0:17:4,41
and it wasn't the first company I worked at, right?


359
0:17:4,41 --> 0:17:5,94
I had worked at tons of places where I did feel


360
0:17:5,94 --> 0:17:8,44
like I was the smartest person in the room.


361
0:17:8,44 --> 0:17:10,24
But, in this environment where I clearly wasn't,


362
0:17:10,24 --> 0:17:11,74
where there was everyone around me or almost


363
0:17:11,74 --> 0:17:13,64
everyone was much smarter than I was,


364
0:17:13,64 --> 0:17:16,18
was the first time that I was actually happy and comfortable


365
0:17:16,18 --> 0:17:18,49
and not stressed out and not thinking about the end


366
0:17:18,49 --> 0:17:22,64
of the world for some strange reason. And, I thought this is great.


367
0:17:22,64 --> 0:17:24,37
This is how I'm going to structure my life.


368
0:17:24,37 --> 0:17:27,19
I want to structure my life so that I am


369
0:17:27,19 --> 0:17:29,48
never the smartest person in the room.


370
0:17:29,48 --> 0:17:31,99
I want to go to other rooms. I want to make friends.


371
0:17:31,99 --> 0:17:35,68
I want to create a bubble around me where


372
0:17:35,68 --> 0:17:38,86
everyone else is just so much better,


373
0:17:38,86 --> 0:17:40,51
you know, smarter, more productive,


374
0:17:40,51 --> 0:17:43,33
more capable because that's how stuff actually happens


375
0:17:43,33 --> 0:17:45,6
and that's how I get to feel good about things and that's


376
0:17:45,6 --> 0:17:47,17
how I learned things and learning is actually really fun


377
0:17:47,17 --> 0:17:49,69
when you are learning things that you care about.


378
0:17:49,69 --> 0:17:53,37
And, I kind of resolved to actually structure my life that way and


379
0:17:53,37 --> 0:17:57,52
that meant not working in places that were going to be stupid,


380
0:17:57,52 --> 0:17:59,45
not doing things that I didn't have any respect for,


381
0:17:59,45 --> 0:18:2,83
not associating with people when I could have avoided that


382
0:18:2,83 --> 0:18:6,73
I felt we thought was - weren't going to add to this but actively


383
0:18:6,73 --> 0:18:10,77
cultivating friends and relationships in work environments


384
0:18:10,77 --> 0:18:13,99
where I felt almost everyone else was smarter than I am.


385
0:18:13,99 --> 0:18:16,34
And, I've managed to hold on to that up until now.


386
0:18:16,34 --> 0:18:18,14
That's been one of the fundamental things that I


387
0:18:18,14 --> 0:18:19,9
have done that I think has worked really well.


388
0:18:19,9 --> 0:18:22,3
In fact, it's clearly the case here, right?


389
0:18:22,3 --> 0:18:24,94
Just me being in this room, I think, is an example of that.


390
0:18:24,94 --> 0:18:27,77
Like, I couldn't get into Stanford, right?


391
0:18:27,77 --> 0:18:31,24
By definition, you guys are all smarter than I am.


392
0:18:31,24 --> 0:18:34,8
This is me and if being here is very much part


393
0:18:34,8 --> 0:18:38,4
and parcel of that lifetime experiment of trying


394
0:18:38,4 --> 0:18:40,92
to surround myself with the most interesting,


395
0:18:40,92 --> 0:18:43,81
the best possible people and then just kind of seeing what happens.


396
0:18:43,81 --> 0:18:49,73
So, I had this realization at ATG and all of a sudden,


397
0:18:49,73 --> 0:18:51,8
it kind of made sense.


398
0:18:51,8 --> 0:18:52,84
I kind of went back to my whole end-of-the-world,


399
0:18:52,84 --> 0:18:53,7
whole transcendence,


400
0:18:53,7 --> 0:18:57,43
whole like general goal of saving humanity and life and intelligence


401
0:18:57,43 --> 0:19:1,96
and everything from total extinction and I thought,


402
0:19:1,96 --> 0:19:3,74
now, I kind of connected the dots;


403
0:19:3,74 --> 0:19:5,43
it makes sense to me because what's going to prevent us?


404
0:19:5,43 --> 0:19:9,63
What's going to prevent humanity from achieving that level?


405
0:19:9,63 --> 0:19:11,4
Well, it's stupidity.


406
0:19:11,4 --> 0:19:12,61
That's what's going to prevent us from happening.


407
0:19:12,61 --> 0:19:15,11
It's every time you turn on the news and there is a


408
0:19:15,11 --> 0:19:18,8
politician saying something jaw-droppingly stupid.


409
0:19:18,8 --> 0:19:21,7
It's the amazing power of the torch-wielding


410
0:19:21,7 --> 0:19:25,68
mob to just destroy things to get in the way.


411
0:19:25,68 --> 0:19:26,62
It's going to be stupidity,


412
0:19:26,62 --> 0:19:30,3
it's going to be stupid people and assholes that are going


413
0:19:30,3 --> 0:19:32,98
to prevent us from doing this and then I thought,


414
0:19:32,98 --> 0:19:35,21
okay now that's becoming actionable,


415
0:19:35,21 --> 0:19:39,96
so now my dream became - I am going to spend my life trying


416
0:19:39,96 --> 0:19:42,57
to reduce the amount of stupidity on this planet.


417
0:19:42,57 --> 0:19:46,47
And that was something I felt I could do.


418
0:19:46,47 --> 0:19:49,25
I felt - like I am not going to get rid


419
0:19:49,25 --> 0:19:52,33
of all of it but I can get started,


420
0:19:52,33 --> 0:19:55,21
I can have an impact and that became my dream.


421
0:19:55,21 --> 0:19:57,85
My dream became to change the world for the


422
0:19:57,85 --> 0:20:1,55
better by reducing the amount of stupidity,


423
0:20:1,55 --> 0:20:4,1
reducing the number of assholes in proportion,


424
0:20:4,1 --> 0:20:8,7
they still grows the population in several different


425
0:20:8,7 --> 0:20:10,72
ways and I said that's what I wanted to do.


426
0:20:10,72 --> 0:20:11,62
So the first thing we did,


427
0:20:11,62 --> 0:20:14,64
when I had this realization is I got a few of my friends together from


428
0:20:14,64 --> 0:20:17,63
college and at the company we decided to start our own company.


429
0:20:17,63 --> 0:20:19,61
So we started our own company called Engine 5


430
0:20:19,61 --> 0:20:23,84
in 1997 and we did - we were all geeks,


431
0:20:23,84 --> 0:20:27,94
we did software, we didn't know anything about business.


432
0:20:27,94 --> 0:20:29,98
We didn't care about business. We didn't know anything about money.


433
0:20:29,98 --> 0:20:31,77
We didn't even know literally.


434
0:20:31,77 --> 0:20:35,3
We did not know that there was a thing called investors.


435
0:20:35,3 --> 0:20:37,84
We didn't know that what you were supposed to do when you start


436
0:20:37,84 --> 0:20:40,83
a company is get other people's money and spend it though,


437
0:20:40,83 --> 0:20:44,1
we didn't know, we never read a business book.


438
0:20:44,1 --> 0:20:49,84
And this was in Boston where things aren't going to bread - entrepreneurship


439
0:20:49,84 --> 0:20:51,35
is not bread into the culture like it is here.


440
0:20:51,35 --> 0:20:53,26
And so, we're just three engineers.


441
0:20:53,26 --> 0:20:53,91
We started the company,


442
0:20:53,91 --> 0:20:55,86
called it Engine 5, because there was going to be five of us,


443
0:20:55,86 --> 0:20:58,77
but two chickened out.


444
0:20:58,77 --> 0:21:1,0
They know who they are and they deeply regret it.


445
0:21:1,0 --> 0:21:6,3
And we just showed up and we started writing software


446
0:21:6,3 --> 0:21:10,7
and we've got very lucky because '97 was just right as


447
0:21:10,7 --> 0:21:12,56
the first dotcom phase was really starting to expand and


448
0:21:12,56 --> 0:21:15,16
so there was infinite demand for good programmers.


449
0:21:15,16 --> 0:21:17,73
We started building ecommerce systems and


450
0:21:17,73 --> 0:21:19,61
stuff like that and we just did it.


451
0:21:19,61 --> 0:21:21,21
We did it with no money. We never put any money in.


452
0:21:21,21 --> 0:21:24,28
We never took a penny of investor money.


453
0:21:24,28 --> 0:21:25,41
A couple years later,


454
0:21:25,41 --> 0:21:28,54
our accountant actually made us put $100 in each because he said,


455
0:21:28,54 --> 0:21:30,84
like, you have to put some money in otherwise


456
0:21:30,84 --> 0:21:33,38
I can't do the books, we said, books.


457
0:21:33,38 --> 0:21:38,57
And out entire company was structured around this one idea;


458
0:21:38,57 --> 0:21:41,96
they say that the most successful companies have a big idea, right?


459
0:21:41,96 --> 0:21:45,45
Our big idea was no assholes.


460
0:21:45,45 --> 0:21:47,46
We didn't know what we were going to do.


461
0:21:47,46 --> 0:21:49,8
We knew that had to do with computers, because that's we were,


462
0:21:49,8 --> 0:21:52,29
we were computer guys but we thought, okay.


463
0:21:52,29 --> 0:21:55,4
Here is the experience, so we had very often including this other


464
0:21:55,4 --> 0:21:57,65
company that had brilliant people,


465
0:21:57,65 --> 0:21:58,2
you would sit there,


466
0:21:58,2 --> 0:22:0,4
you sit at your desk and you look over at somebody,


467
0:22:0,4 --> 0:22:2,16
I don't want to point anyone particular,


468
0:22:2,16 --> 0:22:4,97
you look over at someone and you'd go, that guy over there,


469
0:22:4,97 --> 0:22:8,47
that guy is an asshole.


470
0:22:8,47 --> 0:22:10,79
Why is he here?


471
0:22:10,79 --> 0:22:14,69
When they interviewed him? Didn't they know? Couldn't they tell?


472
0:22:14,69 --> 0:22:15,98
Why did the hire him anyway?


473
0:22:15,98 --> 0:22:19,28
We couldn't figure it out, so we thought this was our big idea.


474
0:22:19,28 --> 0:22:22,33
We are going to start a company and when we interview people


475
0:22:22,33 --> 0:22:24,43
for a job and they come in and we interview them,


476
0:22:24,43 --> 0:22:26,94
and if we think, that's very nice you're real


477
0:22:26,94 --> 0:22:29,5
qualified but you kind of an asshole,


478
0:22:29,5 --> 0:22:30,33
we are not going to hire that guy.


479
0:22:30,33 --> 0:22:32,72
And we thought is it feasible to do that?


480
0:22:32,72 --> 0:22:33,8
Can we have a company like that?


481
0:22:33,8 --> 0:22:36,49
Obviously it's hard because it's never been done before.


482
0:22:36,49 --> 0:22:43,33
But we thought we'd give it a try and we did.


483
0:22:43,33 --> 0:22:45,52
And that actually worked really well.


484
0:22:45,52 --> 0:22:50,67
And so, that - with that as the focus, that as our strategic vision,


485
0:22:50,67 --> 0:22:53,49
plus the fact that we got ridiculously lucky and the timing,


486
0:22:53,49 --> 0:22:57,3
we sold our company a few years later,


487
0:22:57,3 --> 0:22:58,87
I think we grew to like 12 people and we sold


488
0:22:58,87 --> 0:23:1,44
the company for something like $25 million,


489
0:23:1,44 --> 0:23:5,51
$26 million, which was a lot of money back then in the '90s,


490
0:23:5,51 --> 0:23:7,97
especially since there were zero investor dollars in it,


491
0:23:7,97 --> 0:23:9,28
because again like, that was when the


492
0:23:9,28 --> 0:23:11,14
accountant had made us put $300 in,


493
0:23:11,14 --> 0:23:16,13
because he's like okay, I need a base price for something.


494
0:23:16,13 --> 0:23:19,12
And the way we sold our company is we wound


495
0:23:19,12 --> 0:23:25,43
up doing a - we wound up doing this project, we did ecommerce sites.


496
0:23:25,43 --> 0:23:28,9
Back then, ecommerce wasn't really - it was just getting started and


497
0:23:28,9 --> 0:23:30,73
we build shopping carts and websites where you can buy stuff.


498
0:23:30,73 --> 0:23:35,2
And we did a really big project for - I think it was Nokia,


499
0:23:35,2 --> 0:23:38,33
so one of the major companies at the time.


500
0:23:38,33 --> 0:23:40,1
They wanted to sell stuff online.


501
0:23:40,1 --> 0:23:42,92
And the client had decided that they were going to


502
0:23:42,92 --> 0:23:45,3
give us this thing called Vignette Story Server,


503
0:23:45,3 --> 0:23:48,49
which was this giant content management package


504
0:23:48,49 --> 0:23:50,87
from a big company that has just gone public.


505
0:23:50,87 --> 0:23:53,65
And we beg them not to use it, because we looked that and we said,


506
0:23:53,65 --> 0:23:56,28
like, this thing, the Story Server, like you paid $1 million for it,


507
0:23:56,28 --> 0:23:59,89
it doesn't do anything. Like we know, we're technical guys;


508
0:23:59,89 --> 0:24:1,15
we were in charge of implementing it like


509
0:24:1,15 --> 0:24:3,61
I am telling you it doesn't do anything.


510
0:24:3,61 --> 0:24:6,0
I mean it costs money but it doesn't actually accomplish anything,


511
0:24:6,0 --> 0:24:7,85
so still need to customize it for a year but


512
0:24:7,85 --> 0:24:10,14
like we can do that year of customization,


513
0:24:10,14 --> 0:24:12,14
without that thing it will be - it will be just as good,


514
0:24:12,14 --> 0:24:14,97
please don't use it, just give us the $1 million instead,


515
0:24:14,97 --> 0:24:16,42
and they said no, no, a strategic decision,


516
0:24:16,42 --> 0:24:21,7
CEO played golf with somebody, we need to do it, we said alright.


517
0:24:21,7 --> 0:24:25,35
So we had to build this very big complex site using this technology


518
0:24:25,35 --> 0:24:27,95
and it was impossible because the thing didn't do anything.


519
0:24:27,95 --> 0:24:28,93
More than it didn't do anything,


520
0:24:28,93 --> 0:24:32,13
it kind of prevented you from doing anything and


521
0:24:32,13 --> 0:24:34,5
so we had to fight uphill to actually connect it.


522
0:24:34,5 --> 0:24:36,49
We had to build all this plumbing to connect this Story


523
0:24:36,49 --> 0:24:39,52
Server thing to real things that actually did something,


524
0:24:39,52 --> 0:24:41,27
so you can have shopping carts and inventory and whatever,


525
0:24:41,27 --> 0:24:42,49
and it was really difficult,


526
0:24:42,49 --> 0:24:44,79
far harder than it would have been without it.


527
0:24:44,79 --> 0:24:47,36
And - but it worked and we launched the product and then


528
0:24:47,36 --> 0:24:49,96
we were sitting around right afterwards we were just kind


529
0:24:49,96 --> 0:24:55,1
of joking around and one of my friends suggested,


530
0:24:55,1 --> 0:24:57,15
hey, we should send a letter to Vignette,


531
0:24:57,15 --> 0:24:58,69
we should say like, dear Vignette,


532
0:24:58,69 --> 0:25:0,64
just thought you would like to know that we had to do


533
0:25:0,64 --> 0:25:3,14
something with your copy of product and we managed to


534
0:25:3,14 --> 0:25:5,68
do it and it worked but like boy it was difficult,


535
0:25:5,68 --> 0:25:8,2
your product sucks.


536
0:25:8,2 --> 0:25:13,16
And we were sort of laughing about that and then I thought why not,


537
0:25:13,16 --> 0:25:16,51
let's do that, so I wrote a letter to Vignette.


538
0:25:16,51 --> 0:25:18,22
And I wasn't quite as rude about it but I based -


539
0:25:18,22 --> 0:25:20,78
that's what exactly what I told them.


540
0:25:20,78 --> 0:25:23,25
And three weeks later they bought the company.


541
0:25:23,25 --> 0:25:25,73
Because they immediately wrote back like, really?


542
0:25:25,73 --> 0:25:28,13
We would love to get it to do something and yeah we know


543
0:25:28,13 --> 0:25:34,62
that it's - back then everything was booming so fast,


544
0:25:34,62 --> 0:25:37,6
right, they didn't have time to - like to actually write a product,


545
0:25:37,6 --> 0:25:39,0
they were too busy selling it,


546
0:25:39,0 --> 0:25:41,23
they were too busy growing and they knew it.


547
0:25:41,23 --> 0:25:43,8
And they were actually really good about it


548
0:25:43,8 --> 0:25:46,55
and they bought us pretty much immediately.


549
0:25:46,55 --> 0:25:49,8
And then we helped kind of redo the architecture so that


550
0:25:49,8 --> 0:25:52,42
a couple of years later it actually did do something.


551
0:25:52,42 --> 0:25:56,8
And so the lesson we apparently learnt from that is like


552
0:25:56,8 --> 0:25:58,8
hey this whole experiment of like just really trying to


553
0:25:58,8 --> 0:26:1,61
not tolerate stupidity and not have any assholes,


554
0:26:1,61 --> 0:26:3,6
that worked really well although we may have just


555
0:26:3,6 --> 0:26:5,9
gotten really lucky the first time around,


556
0:26:5,9 --> 0:26:8,91
and B, like we were just be direct about what you want.


557
0:26:8,91 --> 0:26:11,94
Like we had a thing that we thought we should - there will be useful information


558
0:26:11,94 --> 0:26:15,31
to tell this big public company and we did it, we told them.


559
0:26:15,31 --> 0:26:17,52
And they did the right thing and they bought us and


560
0:26:17,52 --> 0:26:20,58
everyone - it kind of worked out well for everyone.


561
0:26:20,58 --> 0:26:25,34
And then we spent about two years at Vignette


562
0:26:25,34 --> 0:26:27,18
and then we started our second company,


563
0:26:27,18 --> 0:26:29,65
second team of people right through college - from college.


564
0:26:29,65 --> 0:26:34,72
We started our second company which we did on October 11 of 2001,


565
0:26:34,72 --> 0:26:36,75
so exactly a month after September 11.


566
0:26:36,75 --> 0:26:39,54
And I think like everyone back then we sort of


567
0:26:39,54 --> 0:26:43,65
felt we need to do something more substantive.


568
0:26:43,65 --> 0:26:45,42
It seemed like the stuff we were working on before,


569
0:26:45,42 --> 0:26:46,68
yeah it was interesting technology,


570
0:26:46,68 --> 0:26:51,85
we were doing ecommerce and collaborate filtering and dynamic recommendations


571
0:26:51,85 --> 0:26:54,55
but none of that seem to matter among that September 11,


572
0:26:54,55 --> 0:26:57,2
we wanted to do something more fundamental, more substantive.


573
0:26:57,2 --> 0:27:1,6
So, we met this brilliant professor out of MIT who had this


574
0:27:1,6 --> 0:27:5,47
idea that would really revolutionize security and photography


575
0:27:5,47 --> 0:27:8,38
and smartcards and we did a startup out of MIT,


576
0:27:8,38 --> 0:27:10,5
a spin out of MIT called CoreStreet


577
0:27:10,5 --> 0:27:12,52
basically to productize this idea.


578
0:27:12,52 --> 0:27:17,57
And we applied the same rules, no assholes except but at that point


579
0:27:17,57 --> 0:27:21,15
of course I was grandfathered in.


580
0:27:21,15 --> 0:27:24,93
And small group of people and just build this technology


581
0:27:24,93 --> 0:27:29,16
and that worked well but what I learned from that


582
0:27:29,16 --> 0:27:35,65
is people don't get excited about security.


583
0:27:35,65 --> 0:27:38,19
We were basically selling big systems to the government and


584
0:27:38,19 --> 0:27:41,56
it kind of became an expert of like DoD procurement schedules


585
0:27:41,56 --> 0:27:45,82
and it didn't want - I didn't want that in my head.


586
0:27:45,82 --> 0:27:48,13
And even though we were doing interesting work and important work,


587
0:27:48,13 --> 0:27:50,86
work that actually today is used by millions of people


588
0:27:50,86 --> 0:27:54,17
and really I think did improve security worldwide,


589
0:27:54,17 --> 0:27:56,95
no one cares, like no one is excited about it.


590
0:27:56,95 --> 0:27:58,8
Because in the security field what


591
0:27:58,8 --> 0:28:0,71
I realized is the best case scenario,


592
0:28:0,71 --> 0:28:5,36
the best case scenario in security is your customer resents you,


593
0:28:5,36 --> 0:28:8,37
because nothing bad happen then they feel


594
0:28:8,37 --> 0:28:9,46
like they wasted their time and money,


595
0:28:9,46 --> 0:28:10,68
they didn't need you, nothing bad happen.


596
0:28:10,68 --> 0:28:14,21
That's best case scenario, it's all downhill from that.


597
0:28:14,21 --> 0:28:16,8
And once this company started,


598
0:28:16,8 --> 0:28:18,42
kind of gotten at speed and got to the point where we


599
0:28:18,42 --> 0:28:21,29
were stable we thought okay we need to - it's time for


600
0:28:21,29 --> 0:28:26,7
adults to come in and take over and run this thing and


601
0:28:26,7 --> 0:28:30,22
it's time for us to do something consumer based.


602
0:28:30,22 --> 0:28:33,68
We wanted to do something that people would fall in love with.


603
0:28:33,68 --> 0:28:38,13
We wanted to take our plan of reducing the amount


604
0:28:38,13 --> 0:28:40,6
of stupidity in the world to the next level and


605
0:28:40,6 --> 0:28:42,15
say rather than just doing it based on example,


606
0:28:42,15 --> 0:28:44,62
like no stupidity in our company,


607
0:28:44,62 --> 0:28:48,45
let's actually - like let's actually make something that tries


608
0:28:48,45 --> 0:28:51,51
to make the world smarter or at least its user smarter.


609
0:28:51,51 --> 0:28:54,64
What - but more importantly we said let's make something


610
0:28:54,64 --> 0:28:57,57
that a billion people - if we execute it well I want a billion


611
0:28:57,57 --> 0:28:59,4
people to wake up excited about in the morning.


612
0:28:59,4 --> 0:29:1,33
We didn't know what, but that was the idea.


613
0:29:1,33 --> 0:29:3,41
We said we probably want to move to California because it's going


614
0:29:3,41 --> 0:29:6,12
to have to be consumer based and consumer technology is really like


615
0:29:6,12 --> 0:29:10,27
we want to be in Silicon Valley and we were talking to Andrew,


616
0:29:10,27 --> 0:29:12,17
one of the guys in the team,


617
0:29:12,17 --> 0:29:15,41
one of the co-founders in these companies.


618
0:29:15,41 --> 0:29:16,55
And I said to him, I said,


619
0:29:16,55 --> 0:29:20,17
Andrew, look I want to build something that a billion people


620
0:29:20,17 --> 0:29:24,8
will wake up in the morning excited about, what can we build?


621
0:29:24,8 --> 0:29:26,46
Then he said, Chinese breakfast.


622
0:29:26,46 --> 0:29:32,6
And I said, no, it's not the answer I was looking for.


623
0:29:32,6 --> 0:29:36,85
Let's think about it some more.


624
0:29:36,85 --> 0:29:39,48
And then we realized that it should be Evernote, right?


625
0:29:39,48 --> 0:29:41,7
It should be something that this universe would demand for,


626
0:29:41,7 --> 0:29:42,57
because we thought - well,


627
0:29:42,57 --> 0:29:45,48
none of us are fully happy with our meat brands.


628
0:29:45,48 --> 0:29:48,57
All of us wish we had better memory,


629
0:29:48,57 --> 0:29:50,97
that's - yeah, that's not an original idea,


630
0:29:50,97 --> 0:29:52,33
there's something new in that, right?


631
0:29:52,33 --> 0:29:54,83
People have been thinking - people have been creating technologies,


632
0:29:54,83 --> 0:29:56,38
you know, these to be rocks,


633
0:29:56,38 --> 0:29:59,64
for help you remembering stuff for tens of thousands of years.


634
0:29:59,64 --> 0:30:2,31
But if we can execute it, if we can do it really well,


635
0:30:2,31 --> 0:30:5,98
if we can execute this idea of building something that


636
0:30:5,98 --> 0:30:8,44
will improve everyone's memory and we execute it,


637
0:30:8,44 --> 0:30:10,93
so that a billion people would use it,


638
0:30:10,93 --> 0:30:13,78
we'll have something. And we took a gamble. We took a bet.


639
0:30:13,78 --> 0:30:15,66
The technology had just gotten to the point where


640
0:30:15,66 --> 0:30:17,58
that was feasible for the first time ever,


641
0:30:17,58 --> 0:30:20,89
that we can do something that was really, really mass market.


642
0:30:20,89 --> 0:30:22,33
And that's how Evernote came about.


643
0:30:22,33 --> 0:30:25,39
So we started working on this idea of human memory extension.


644
0:30:25,39 --> 0:30:27,47
We immediately ran into another small team


645
0:30:27,47 --> 0:30:29,81
that was working on the exact same idea.


646
0:30:29,81 --> 0:30:33,68
That team was led by a really brilliant Russian-American


647
0:30:33,68 --> 0:30:36,78
inventor and scientist named Stepan Pachikov. We met.


648
0:30:36,78 --> 0:30:40,8
We decided to actually combine the two teams together in 2007.


649
0:30:40,8 --> 0:30:42,7
He said, rather than two small companies competing with each other,


650
0:30:42,7 --> 0:30:44,47
let's just join forces and so we did that in '07.


651
0:30:44,47 --> 0:30:49,3
We formed the current entity called Evernote


652
0:30:49,3 --> 0:30:51,44
and it's been a lot of fun ever since.


653
0:30:51,44 --> 0:31:0,3
And the main - the main goal of Evernote was to just take that mission


654
0:31:0,3 --> 0:31:2,65
of reducing the stupidity in the world and make it more direct,


655
0:31:2,65 --> 0:31:4,13
because we said, we're going to run


656
0:31:4,13 --> 0:31:7,68
the company using these principles.


657
0:31:7,68 --> 0:31:9,87
We're going to talk about these principles and we're


658
0:31:9,87 --> 0:31:12,45
going to have a product that if you use it,


659
0:31:12,45 --> 0:31:15,62
it has a chance of actually just improving your memory of making you -


660
0:31:15,62 --> 0:31:18,13
of making you smarter so we decided to kind of do this more directly.


661
0:31:18,13 --> 0:31:21,83
So this is - this is our dream. This is what we're pursuing.


662
0:31:21,83 --> 0:31:25,3
And I finally feel like it's a suitably epic dream


663
0:31:25,3 --> 0:31:27,64
that it's actually worth devoting my life to.


664
0:31:27,64 --> 0:31:31,81
And so that was always the plan at Evernote.


665
0:31:31,81 --> 0:31:35,93
There is no exit strategy at Evernote, and there never was.


666
0:31:35,93 --> 0:31:40,13
It's our third company and this is the one we get to keep.


667
0:31:40,13 --> 0:31:42,6
The first two, we didn't build for us, right.


668
0:31:42,6 --> 0:31:44,94
The first two, we built for somebody else.


669
0:31:44,94 --> 0:31:47,24
Well, we built it to manipulate our environment so that


670
0:31:47,24 --> 0:31:50,15
we can have a fun place to work and to make some money,


671
0:31:50,15 --> 0:31:52,0
but ultimately we weren't - the products


672
0:31:52,0 --> 0:31:53,32
we were building weren't for us,


673
0:31:53,32 --> 0:31:55,86
because the first company built e-commerce products for retailers,


674
0:31:55,86 --> 0:31:57,53
but we weren't a retailer.


675
0:31:57,53 --> 0:32:0,7
Then the second company built security products for big governments,


676
0:32:0,7 --> 0:32:4,1
but we're not a big government yet.


677
0:32:4,1 --> 0:32:6,13
And we said, well the third time around,


678
0:32:6,13 --> 0:32:8,7
let's build something for us, let's build something that we want that


679
0:32:8,7 --> 0:32:12,62
we love and if you're doing that, why would you ever want to exit.


680
0:32:12,62 --> 0:32:13,76
And so - there is no exit,


681
0:32:13,76 --> 0:32:16,7
there is no - there is no acquisition strategy.


682
0:32:16,7 --> 0:32:18,76
We've turned down every acquisition offer.


683
0:32:18,76 --> 0:32:21,52
We've structured the board. We've structured our investment in such a


684
0:32:21,52 --> 0:32:24,39
way that we can build a 100-year company,


685
0:32:24,39 --> 0:32:27,17
because that's much more fun, that is much cooler.


686
0:32:27,17 --> 0:32:30,84
It's much more interesting to come into work every day and think I'm


687
0:32:30,84 --> 0:32:36,53
pursuing my life stream and I'm doing it in a way that I intend to do


688
0:32:36,53 --> 0:32:41,64
in all seriousness for the rest of my life and I'm not taking any shortcuts


689
0:32:41,64 --> 0:32:44,67
about building the company in such a way that I can flip it,


690
0:32:44,67 --> 0:32:47,56
that I can sell it, that I can exit, because if you want to exit,


691
0:32:47,56 --> 0:32:50,78
if you want to sell your company, something is wrong, right?


692
0:32:50,78 --> 0:32:52,81
If you want to sell it,


693
0:32:52,81 --> 0:32:55,1
something is not - something isn't correct,


694
0:32:55,1 --> 0:32:57,88
right, because you are obviously not sufficiently in love with it.


695
0:32:57,88 --> 0:33:3,0
You're obviously valuing it less than the acquirer, so why is that?


696
0:33:3,0 --> 0:33:5,36
I mean maybe there's a legitimate reason,


697
0:33:5,36 --> 0:33:9,2
maybe you think that your dream has a much better future if


698
0:33:9,2 --> 0:33:11,69
you combine forces with the acquirer, that makes sense.


699
0:33:11,69 --> 0:33:14,9
But if you're just doing it to exit


700
0:33:14,9 --> 0:33:15,12
that doesn't make any sense to us.


701
0:33:15,12 --> 0:33:18,17
So having exited two companies we explicitly said,


702
0:33:18,17 --> 0:33:20,34
no exit, at Evernote.


703
0:33:20,34 --> 0:33:21,85
In fact, about a year ago,


704
0:33:21,85 --> 0:33:25,91
I kind of tired of having some of those conversation


705
0:33:25,91 --> 0:33:28,0
with the company where - people,


706
0:33:28,0 --> 0:33:29,49
in a small company, everyone just talks about,


707
0:33:29,49 --> 0:33:30,75
your executives, your staff will be like,


708
0:33:30,75 --> 0:33:31,79
hey, who do you think will buy us?


709
0:33:31,79 --> 0:33:34,18
You think Google will buy us, you think you know whatever.


710
0:33:34,18 --> 0:33:36,93
And I finally said, okay, I have had it with this conversation,


711
0:33:36,93 --> 0:33:40,14
we just turned on a big offer for acquisition and I said


712
0:33:40,14 --> 0:33:42,2
we're not - we're no longer talking about who's going to buy us,


713
0:33:42,2 --> 0:33:45,94
no one is going to buy us, let's talk about who we're going to buy.


714
0:33:45,94 --> 0:33:46,98
And let's do that seriously.


715
0:33:46,98 --> 0:33:51,89
Let's seriously say, let us just shift gears, who do we want to buy?


716
0:33:51,89 --> 0:33:54,0
And people said okay, yeah, that's a more interesting question,


717
0:33:54,0 --> 0:33:57,8
that's actually more fun to think about that and we all said Skitch,


718
0:33:57,8 --> 0:33:59,34
because we all love this little product called Skitch


719
0:33:59,34 --> 0:34:0,71
and we actually thought that was a tip of the iceberg


720
0:34:0,71 --> 0:34:2,56
of what we could do with it and a few months later,


721
0:34:2,56 --> 0:34:5,8
we bought our first company and it was Skitch and that was actually


722
0:34:5,8 --> 0:34:8,5
awesomely fun to acquire this great - this great team,


723
0:34:8,5 --> 0:34:9,32
this great technology,


724
0:34:9,32 --> 0:34:11,86
a product that we had already been in love with,


725
0:34:11,86 --> 0:34:14,88
that is actively helps you to be smarter and more productive


726
0:34:14,88 --> 0:34:20,16
and a better communicator and we'll buy several more as well.


727
0:34:20,16 --> 0:34:22,26
But the kind of companies that we're buying now,


728
0:34:22,26 --> 0:34:23,43
we have the same discussion.


729
0:34:23,43 --> 0:34:27,58
We don't buy a company that somebody wants to sell to us.


730
0:34:27,58 --> 0:34:30,69
You buy a company like Skitch that has founders


731
0:34:30,69 --> 0:34:33,8
who are fundamentally in love with this idea that


732
0:34:33,8 --> 0:34:35,29
getting out is the last thing in their minds.


733
0:34:35,29 --> 0:34:37,31
And we have to convince them that the best way to reach that


734
0:34:37,31 --> 0:34:40,9
idea is to do it inside that we share the same passion,


735
0:34:40,9 --> 0:34:42,66
we share the same vision, you will get there together,


736
0:34:42,66 --> 0:34:46,45
you guys will actually wind up fulfilling your dream better,


737
0:34:46,45 --> 0:34:48,96
inside Evernote than outside of it.


738
0:34:48,96 --> 0:34:51,89
And that worked really well and in one case we actually just purchased


739
0:34:51,89 --> 0:34:54,19
couple of more companies that we haven't announced yet,


740
0:34:54,19 --> 0:34:57,2
but hopefully, we will soon and we'll do that for the next


741
0:34:57,2 --> 0:35:2,13
100 years and this 100-year plan is a hell of a lot better,


742
0:35:2,13 --> 0:35:6,91
a hell of a lot more fun than any of the previous things I've done.


743
0:35:6,91 --> 0:35:9,77
But the secret is it's stuff that we're building for ourselves.


744
0:35:9,77 --> 0:35:11,32
I do not think I would have the patience to


745
0:35:11,32 --> 0:35:16,8
spend 100 years building software for banks.


746
0:35:16,8 --> 0:35:18,84
So, having said all that,


747
0:35:18,84 --> 0:35:22,26
I think that if we can get back to where this all started,


748
0:35:22,26 --> 0:35:24,22
right, the kind of standard entrepreneurial talk.


749
0:35:24,22 --> 0:35:29,6
So, you want to be an entrepreneur.


750
0:35:29,6 --> 0:35:35,3
Well, I don't, I never did. The first time - I remember the first time


751
0:35:35,3 --> 0:35:36,72
somebody called me a serial entrepreneur,


752
0:35:36,72 --> 0:35:39,27
I think I just started my second company and I like Phil Libin,


753
0:35:39,27 --> 0:35:41,9
serial entrepreneur - serial entrepreneur like the


754
0:35:41,9 --> 0:35:44,4
Quaker Oats guys is a serial entrepreneur, right.


755
0:35:44,4 --> 0:35:45,56
I just started a company;


756
0:35:45,56 --> 0:35:48,16
I don't remember - not really sure what that means.


757
0:35:48,16 --> 0:35:51,25
My goal wasn't to create companies and sell them.


758
0:35:51,25 --> 0:35:53,83
My goal was to do something meaningful and


759
0:35:53,83 --> 0:35:57,6
I thought that lacking any artistic skills,


760
0:35:57,6 --> 0:36:1,14
the best way to actually have this kind of impact is to make


761
0:36:1,14 --> 0:36:3,69
an entrepreneur and make some money for people because that -


762
0:36:3,69 --> 0:36:6,2
the universe lets you do more and more interesting things if


763
0:36:6,2 --> 0:36:9,57
you can actually demonstrate an ability to make money.


764
0:36:9,57 --> 0:36:10,87
And that's how it's worked out.


765
0:36:10,87 --> 0:36:13,3
So, if you want to be an entrepreneur,


766
0:36:13,3 --> 0:36:14,86
I think the first thing is to really ask yourself


767
0:36:14,86 --> 0:36:18,8
is why because there are many bad reasons.


768
0:36:18,8 --> 0:36:22,32
There is only one good reason. There're many bad reasons.


769
0:36:22,32 --> 0:36:24,3
So, if you want to be an entrepreneur,


770
0:36:24,3 --> 0:36:25,26
and you've fallen into any of the most


771
0:36:25,26 --> 0:36:28,69
common bad reasons, don't do it. I think the number one mistake;


772
0:36:28,69 --> 0:36:30,89
the number one bad reason for being an entrepreneur


773
0:36:30,89 --> 0:36:33,15
is because you want to make money.


774
0:36:33,15 --> 0:36:35,1
If you are thinking of being an entrepreneur because


775
0:36:35,1 --> 0:36:36,15
you think it's a good way to make money,


776
0:36:36,15 --> 0:36:39,74
you are just bad at math because it isn't.


777
0:36:39,74 --> 0:36:44,34
You just have to look at the statistics.


778
0:36:44,34 --> 0:36:46,44
Thank you.


779
0:36:46,44 --> 0:36:46,73
Right.


780
0:36:46,73 --> 0:36:47,71
Depending on how you count,


781
0:36:47,71 --> 0:36:52,46
95% or 99% of companies fail and if you are smart enough to be in


782
0:36:52,46 --> 0:36:55,93
this room and you are talented enough and you have driven enough just


783
0:36:55,93 --> 0:36:59,44
to be here and you want to optimize for your lifetime earnings,


784
0:36:59,44 --> 0:37:1,8
being an entrepreneur is stupid.


785
0:37:1,8 --> 0:37:3,42
If you want to optimize for your lifetime earnings,


786
0:37:3,42 --> 0:37:5,12
having already got into this room at Stanford,


787
0:37:5,12 --> 0:37:7,23
you're much better off just getting a job.


788
0:37:7,23 --> 0:37:9,86
Become a banker or something, you will make a lot more money.


789
0:37:9,86 --> 0:37:11,81
The expected case, there will be a lot more.


790
0:37:11,81 --> 0:37:14,39
Some people get lucky and make significant amount.


791
0:37:14,39 --> 0:37:17,9
But being entrepreneur is not a good idea if that's your main goal.


792
0:37:17,9 --> 0:37:19,33
So if you want to make money, I would say that is a serious mistake.


793
0:37:19,33 --> 0:37:22,9
If you are doing it because you have some sense of power,


794
0:37:22,9 --> 0:37:25,43
like you want to be the CEO because you're going to be at the top,


795
0:37:25,43 --> 0:37:28,14
there is this pyramid, right, this OR chart and you are at the top


796
0:37:28,14 --> 0:37:29,88
and there's all these people below you.


797
0:37:29,88 --> 0:37:32,34
That's ridiculous, it doesn't work like that.


798
0:37:32,34 --> 0:37:35,53
When you are the CEO of a startup company, everyone is your boss.


799
0:37:35,53 --> 0:37:37,99
You are all the way at the bottom. It is an inverted pyramid.


800
0:37:37,99 --> 0:37:40,67
Like you are down here and it goes like that


801
0:37:40,67 --> 0:37:42,66
and all of your employees are your boss.


802
0:37:42,66 --> 0:37:44,45
All of your investors are your bosses.


803
0:37:44,45 --> 0:37:45,88
All of your customers are your bosses.


804
0:37:45,88 --> 0:37:48,29
Everyone in the media is your boss.


805
0:37:48,29 --> 0:37:51,46
I have never had more bosses than I have at Evernote.


806
0:37:51,46 --> 0:37:52,53
So, if it's a power trip,


807
0:37:52,53 --> 0:37:53,83
if you want to be an entrepreneur because it's


808
0:37:53,83 --> 0:37:57,59
a power trip that's just a ridiculous idea.


809
0:37:57,59 --> 0:37:59,16
I've had some people say that they want to


810
0:37:59,16 --> 0:38:5,21
do it because they want more flex time.


811
0:38:5,21 --> 0:38:7,98
Oh, I've got this job and it's 9:00 to 5:00


812
0:38:7,98 --> 0:38:9,23
and I really want more flexibility,


813
0:38:9,23 --> 0:38:11,46
so I would like to do something entrepreneurial


814
0:38:11,46 --> 0:38:15,1
so I can kind of control my own hours.


815
0:38:15,1 --> 0:38:17,51
You do get flex time as an entrepreneur.


816
0:38:17,51 --> 0:38:23,56
You get to work any 20 hours a day you want.


817
0:38:23,56 --> 0:38:26,27
So lots of really bad reasons and if you are thinking


818
0:38:26,27 --> 0:38:27,7
of being an entrepreneur for one of those reasons,


819
0:38:27,7 --> 0:38:29,93
I would say really like, yeah, take this class,


820
0:38:29,93 --> 0:38:30,88
learn about it, it's all good,


821
0:38:30,88 --> 0:38:33,1
you can learn about art appreciation without becoming


822
0:38:33,1 --> 0:38:36,78
a professional artist, but don't do it.


823
0:38:36,78 --> 0:38:38,71
If you want to be an entrepreneur because you want to change


824
0:38:38,71 --> 0:38:41,39
the world because you want to do something that has a fundamental


825
0:38:41,39 --> 0:38:46,52
impact on the universe and you have a decent idea of the direction


826
0:38:46,52 --> 0:38:48,86
of how you want to change or what that change is,


827
0:38:48,86 --> 0:38:51,61
then actually think it's an unparalleled time to do it.


828
0:38:51,61 --> 0:38:54,31
And to wrap up where I started,


829
0:38:54,31 --> 0:38:58,42
now is the best time in the history of the universe to start


830
0:38:58,42 --> 0:39:3,46
a company because we are living in a geek meritocracy today


831
0:39:3,46 --> 0:39:6,68
or as close to a geek meritocracy as ever happened.


832
0:39:6,68 --> 0:39:9,57
My first two companies, they're all software companies,


833
0:39:9,57 --> 0:39:12,29
we had to spend probably 70% of our time and resources,


834
0:39:12,29 --> 0:39:15,13
we spent 30% roughly on making the product,


835
0:39:15,13 --> 0:39:17,77
we spent 70% on all the other crap.


836
0:39:17,77 --> 0:39:20,8
Marketing, logistics, channel partnerships,


837
0:39:20,8 --> 0:39:23,99
advertising, all of that stuff, 70%.


838
0:39:23,99 --> 0:39:26,8
Now, especially if you are doing something for consumers,


839
0:39:26,8 --> 0:39:31,3
you can spend 95% or 99% of all your resources making great


840
0:39:31,3 --> 0:39:34,12
product and you get massive leverage and everything else.


841
0:39:34,12 --> 0:39:36,31
And it's only happened two or three years ago,


842
0:39:36,31 --> 0:39:40,29
right, because of app stores, right, because I used to have to worry.


843
0:39:40,29 --> 0:39:41,66
Well, if I release a new version,


844
0:39:41,66 --> 0:39:44,66
how are people - how are people in a different stage going to get it?


845
0:39:44,66 --> 0:39:48,29
Well, I better have a deal with a retailer that works in Tennessee.


846
0:39:48,29 --> 0:39:49,66
Now, you make a great app,


847
0:39:49,66 --> 0:39:52,17
everyone in the planet can have it tomorrow, right.


848
0:39:52,17 --> 0:39:53,14
Same thing for advertising,


849
0:39:53,14 --> 0:39:54,92
I used to worry about how do you reach people.


850
0:39:54,92 --> 0:39:56,51
Well now you don't have to worry about how to reach people,


851
0:39:56,51 --> 0:39:58,3
what do you mean reach people, you make a great product,


852
0:39:58,3 --> 0:39:59,71
everyone is already having a different number


853
0:39:59,71 --> 0:40:2,3
of conversations in all their social networks,


854
0:40:2,3 --> 0:40:3,51
you just want to be the thing that they talk about.


855
0:40:3,51 --> 0:40:8,21
So be great, people will talk about you, end of the story.


856
0:40:8,21 --> 0:40:10,38
Smartphones, computers are everywhere.


857
0:40:10,38 --> 0:40:12,1
Without smartphones, it wasn't possible.


858
0:40:12,1 --> 0:40:15,1
Freemium economics, I have got lots of things to say about freemium


859
0:40:15,1 --> 0:40:18,4
in different talks but freemium economics works really well,


860
0:40:18,4 --> 0:40:21,1
if you know what you are doing, if you build a good consumer app.


861
0:40:21,1 --> 0:40:23,78
These things put together, app stores, smartphones,


862
0:40:23,78 --> 0:40:26,73
open source infrastructure, network services, freemium economics;


863
0:40:26,73 --> 0:40:29,11
all of this is new in the past five years.


864
0:40:29,11 --> 0:40:31,14
All of it together make this a geek meritocracy,


865
0:40:31,14 --> 0:40:34,41
make this the best possible time in the history of the universe to


866
0:40:34,41 --> 0:40:37,76
innovate and start a company and all of the depressing stuff you hear


867
0:40:37,76 --> 0:40:42,29
on TV about how it's a bad economy and it's a bad time to do it,


868
0:40:42,29 --> 0:40:43,6
it's complete nonsense.


869
0:40:43,6 --> 0:40:47,61
All I ask about that is to say well, when would you rather be alive.


870
0:40:47,61 --> 0:40:50,51
Is there any point that you think you would rather like - would


871
0:40:50,51 --> 0:40:54,61
just change your life today for - would you be back in 1992,


872
0:40:54,61 --> 0:40:55,73
would you go back to the '70s,


873
0:40:55,73 --> 0:40:57,36
would you go back to the 1500s like when,


874
0:40:57,36 --> 0:40:59,58
when was there ever a better time.


875
0:40:59,58 --> 0:41:2,73
There hasn't been, there is always some feeling that kids


876
0:41:2,73 --> 0:41:5,15
today and there's malaise or whatever but the facts are,


877
0:41:5,15 --> 0:41:7,72
the verifiable facts is we've never been close


878
0:41:7,72 --> 0:41:10,84
to fair meritocracy and if you are a geek,


879
0:41:10,84 --> 0:41:14,1
pretty sure some of you are,


880
0:41:14,1 --> 0:41:15,76
now is the best time to be an entrepreneur,


881
0:41:15,76 --> 0:41:32,234
if you got the right reason to do it. So, thank you very much.


882
0:41:32,234 --> 0:41:34,14
Phil will you - when somebody asks a question, would you repeat it,


883
0:41:34,14 --> 0:41:37,18
so the online audience can hear the question?


884
0:41:37,18 --> 0:41:41,24
Sure, please just... Over here I'll start.


885
0:41:41,24 --> 0:41:45,24
Thank you, that was great. Thank you so much.


886
0:41:45,24 --> 0:41:49,26
The first question, so you never want to sell the company. Yeah.


887
0:41:49,26 --> 0:41:53,65
But you raised $50 million recently from people who generally


888
0:41:53,65 --> 0:41:58,5
like to get their money back and multiples thereof.


889
0:41:58,5 --> 0:42:1,99
And also I think we read somewhere that when you raised


890
0:42:1,99 --> 0:42:3,89
it you sort of said you kind of didn't need it.


891
0:42:3,89 --> 0:42:5,4
Yeah, yeah.


892
0:42:5,4 --> 0:42:9,76
So can you rationalize those comments against what you just


893
0:42:9,76 --> 0:42:12,42
said about building a 100-year company, never selling it.


894
0:42:12,42 --> 0:42:16,59
How do you actually make all those pieces fit?


895
0:42:16,59 --> 0:42:19,12
So the question is, I said I don't want to sell


896
0:42:19,12 --> 0:42:21,3
the company but we raised a bunch of money,


897
0:42:21,3 --> 0:42:25,5
close to $100 million from people who like to get their money back,


898
0:42:25,5 --> 0:42:28,79
how do we rationalize that. Well, pretty easy.


899
0:42:28,79 --> 0:42:30,97
So there has actually been this complete revolution,


900
0:42:30,97 --> 0:42:33,6
just in the past two years in the VC industry,


901
0:42:33,6 --> 0:42:36,2
which I think people here kind of know but the memo hasn't


902
0:42:36,2 --> 0:42:37,59
quite gotten out to the rest of the world yet.


903
0:42:37,59 --> 0:42:41,94
But there is a total fundamental change of shifting - shift


904
0:42:41,94 --> 0:42:46,61
of thinking about this which is sophisticated investors


905
0:42:46,61 --> 0:42:49,42
like Sequoia and Morgenthaler are our main investors,


906
0:42:49,42 --> 0:42:52,64
have totally decoupled exit from liquidity.


907
0:42:52,64 --> 0:42:53,95
Those two things used to be together,


908
0:42:53,95 --> 0:42:56,56
so you start a company and the investors


909
0:42:56,56 --> 0:42:58,97
want you to starve until you're done,


910
0:42:58,97 --> 0:43:0,33
until you exit and then everyone gets their


911
0:43:0,33 --> 0:43:2,84
money back and that's fundamentally stupid.


912
0:43:2,84 --> 0:43:5,2
And like look in hindsight like obviously it's stupid,


913
0:43:5,2 --> 0:43:6,95
why - who does that benefit?


914
0:43:6,95 --> 0:43:9,8
Why would anyone want to put pressure on the founders of


915
0:43:9,8 --> 0:43:11,76
a company to potentially sell prematurely because yeah,


916
0:43:11,76 --> 0:43:13,22
they are kind of successful but they also got to put


917
0:43:13,22 --> 0:43:15,42
their kids through college and they have a lot of money


918
0:43:15,42 --> 0:43:17,53
on paper but they don't have any money really.


919
0:43:17,53 --> 0:43:19,97
So this whole idea of coupling exit and liquidity


920
0:43:19,97 --> 0:43:22,62
which was 99% of the time before,


921
0:43:22,62 --> 0:43:24,61
it doesn't make any sense and it was people


922
0:43:24,61 --> 0:43:27,23
here that figured out, boy that's dumb.


923
0:43:27,23 --> 0:43:28,64
What do you do when you see something that's dumb,


924
0:43:28,64 --> 0:43:32,27
well you just stop doing it. So the secondary markets today provide


925
0:43:32,27 --> 0:43:36,45
all the liquidity that you ever need, totally separate from an exit.


926
0:43:36,45 --> 0:43:40,3
So when you do a round, especially any of the later rounds,


927
0:43:40,3 --> 0:43:44,2
it's usually not only possible but it's usually quite encouraged to allow


928
0:43:44,2 --> 0:43:47,56
existing shareholders to sell a certain portion of their shares.


929
0:43:47,56 --> 0:43:50,83
The bigger funds like Sequoia, Sequoia is not a monolithic entity,


930
0:43:50,83 --> 0:43:53,18
right, they have many funds with different risk profiles,


931
0:43:53,18 --> 0:43:55,46
so they can actually - some of their funds that


932
0:43:55,46 --> 0:43:57,42
have more start up profiles can get out,


933
0:43:57,42 --> 0:44:0,1
some of their growth funds can get in, they can shuffle that through,


934
0:44:0,1 --> 0:44:1,26
there's tons of other investors that are


935
0:44:1,26 --> 0:44:4,25
happy to buy shares from founders,


936
0:44:4,25 --> 0:44:8,4
from employees, from shareholders and so you can have multiple liquidity


937
0:44:8,4 --> 0:44:12,43
events all the way through and then at some point you'll IPO and


938
0:44:12,43 --> 0:44:14,79
you have the liquidity that way but there is no exit.


939
0:44:14,79 --> 0:44:16,95
There is no synchronized event where everyone is


940
0:44:16,95 --> 0:44:19,61
like we're done because why should there be.


941
0:44:19,61 --> 0:44:20,78
That's not good for anyone.


942
0:44:20,78 --> 0:44:25,8
So that's - the separation of liquidity from exit,


943
0:44:25,8 --> 0:44:28,7
I think, was like a profound shift that happened - really Facebook,


944
0:44:28,7 --> 0:44:31,82
I think, is probably the first company that really figured this out.


945
0:44:31,82 --> 0:44:35,12
Facebook and investors like Sequoia, like DST, like Yuri Milner,


946
0:44:35,12 --> 0:44:36,78
they were kind of the few people to do it and it's like you're


947
0:44:36,78 --> 0:44:40,19
watching history happen right now and it's fantastic.


948
0:44:40,19 --> 0:44:42,88
Like I go to Boston and like the Boston BCs didn't get that memo yet.


949
0:44:42,88 --> 0:44:44,82
So they are still conflating those two things.


950
0:44:44,82 --> 0:44:46,89
But it's only, you know, sooner or later, the next decade or two,


951
0:44:46,89 --> 0:44:51,2
that everyone will figure it out.


952
0:44:51,2 --> 0:44:52,48
Please.


953
0:44:52,48 --> 0:44:55,98
Can you talk a little bit more about when the team broke up when you


954
0:44:55,98 --> 0:44:59,72
were doing Engine 5 and how you have dealt through that change?


955
0:44:59,72 --> 0:45:1,67
When the team broke up? Yeah, you said there were going to


956
0:45:1,67 --> 0:45:4,13
be five founders and then two left.


957
0:45:4,13 --> 0:45:6,16
Yeah, yeah, so there was - well,


958
0:45:6,16 --> 0:45:7,42
that happened right before we founded it.


959
0:45:7,42 --> 0:45:10,17
So we basically got five coworkers together,


960
0:45:10,17 --> 0:45:13,92
you know, five friends and we said, let's make a company,


961
0:45:13,92 --> 0:45:16,83
call it Engine 5 and everyone said awesome and then,


962
0:45:16,83 --> 0:45:19,8
you know, when we got the name and got the domain name,


963
0:45:19,8 --> 0:45:20,27
because back then you could get domain


964
0:45:20,27 --> 0:45:24,72
names and just be like engine5.com, yay it's free.


965
0:45:24,72 --> 0:45:27,92
And then two people just, you know, they just chickened out,


966
0:45:27,92 --> 0:45:29,67
appropriately so, right.


967
0:45:29,67 --> 0:45:31,74
Because of everything that I just said, like why be an entrepreneur,


968
0:45:31,74 --> 0:45:34,95
like these were two people who - they didn't want to change the world.


969
0:45:34,95 --> 0:45:37,56
They wanted some stability, they wanted to have a family,


970
0:45:37,56 --> 0:45:38,43
they were making good money,


971
0:45:38,43 --> 0:45:42,94
they made the perfectly rational decision to not join three crazy


972
0:45:42,94 --> 0:45:47,19
people that were leaving a good job to go do their own thing.


973
0:45:47,19 --> 0:45:49,23
So - yeah, they just chickened out and we just said,


974
0:45:49,23 --> 0:45:52,22
okay, well, we'll do it without you.


975
0:45:52,22 --> 0:45:55,7
And it has - could be a lot harder if that happens later on, of course.


976
0:45:55,7 --> 0:45:57,19
But ultimately, you know,


977
0:45:57,19 --> 0:46:1,3
if you already have a company and you have a co-founder


978
0:46:1,3 --> 0:46:3,57
and it's just not working out, that's painful.


979
0:46:3,57 --> 0:46:7,24
But there is a little mental tool that


980
0:46:7,24 --> 0:46:9,56
I thought of several years ago.


981
0:46:9,56 --> 0:46:12,25
So a management tool, how to be a good CEO,


982
0:46:12,25 --> 0:46:14,5
there's this fundamental thing,


983
0:46:14,5 --> 0:46:19,71
which is most people conflate difficult


984
0:46:19,71 --> 0:46:22,57
decisions with unpleasant decisions.


985
0:46:22,57 --> 0:46:25,99
Super common cognitive mistake made by everyone but particularly


986
0:46:25,99 --> 0:46:28,61
devastating if you are in management, then you make it.


987
0:46:28,61 --> 0:46:31,13
If there is - there are decisions that are difficult in that you don't


988
0:46:31,13 --> 0:46:34,58
know what the right answer is and then there's decisions that are unpleasant


989
0:46:34,58 --> 0:46:37,71
in that the consequences of making them are deeply unpleasant and almost


990
0:46:37,71 --> 0:46:39,45
everyone thinks that those two things are the same.


991
0:46:39,45 --> 0:46:41,25
In fact, when we say like that's a really hard decision,


992
0:46:41,25 --> 0:46:43,16
a lot of the time they mean like no it wasn't,


993
0:46:43,16 --> 0:46:44,39
it was easy to see what the right answer is;


994
0:46:44,39 --> 0:46:45,44
it's just really unpleasant.


995
0:46:45,44 --> 0:46:48,96
Like when you have to fire someone, that is not a difficult decision.


996
0:46:48,96 --> 0:46:51,9
Very, very rarely are you actually on the


997
0:46:51,9 --> 0:46:54,4
fence about like does this make sense, does it not make sense.


998
0:46:54,4 --> 0:46:56,86
It's deeply unpleasant, especially if it's a friend of yours.


999
0:46:56,86 --> 0:46:59,3
So one kind of central thing whenever you have any kind of


1000
0:46:59,3 --> 0:47:1,26
disagreement is you got to separate those two things out,


1001
0:47:1,26 --> 0:47:4,87
you got to be like what's obviously the right answer and you


1002
0:47:4,87 --> 0:47:7,9
totally separate that out from whether or not it's fun,


1003
0:47:7,9 --> 0:47:12,61
from whether or not it's emotionally pleasant or not and you make


1004
0:47:12,61 --> 0:47:15,4
the decision based on what's correct and you deal with it and it's


1005
0:47:15,4 --> 0:47:19,7
almost always better to do it sooner rather than later.


1006
0:47:19,7 --> 0:47:20,2
Please.


1007
0:47:20,2 --> 0:47:24,43
You said that you joined with another smaller company,


1008
0:47:24,43 --> 0:47:27,81
how did that process go as far as managing


1009
0:47:27,81 --> 0:47:33,16
ownership? Well, it was mixed, frankly.


1010
0:47:33,16 --> 0:47:37,7
On the one hand, it was really good in terms of


1011
0:47:37,7 --> 0:47:39,5
the two companies meshed together and Stepan,


1012
0:47:39,5 --> 0:47:41,79
the founder of the other one and I just got along fantastically


1013
0:47:41,79 --> 0:47:46,81
well and he was just fantastic about kind of being extremely helpful


1014
0:47:46,81 --> 0:47:50,18
but also not getting in the way because I was the CEO of the combined


1015
0:47:50,18 --> 0:47:52,9
entity and sort of culturally it worked out.


1016
0:47:52,9 --> 0:47:55,27
So like the mix between the two people,


1017
0:47:55,27 --> 0:47:58,77
that actually went great, or the two teams.


1018
0:47:58,77 --> 0:48:0,78
And there were some difficulties but for the most part,


1019
0:48:0,78 --> 0:48:1,64
that was very good.


1020
0:48:1,64 --> 0:48:4,23
The main problem that we had which I totally didn't anticipate and


1021
0:48:4,23 --> 0:48:8,71
why I do not recommend doing this at all is it made us un-fundable


1022
0:48:8,71 --> 0:48:13,6
because it - what it turns out is investors especially here but really


1023
0:48:13,6 --> 0:48:18,32
everywhere like they don't want to see creativity on the cap table,


1024
0:48:18,32 --> 0:48:21,94
anything that doesn't start like a normal startup is like two friends


1025
0:48:21,94 --> 0:48:24,0
in college and you get started and you get some founder shares


1026
0:48:24,0 --> 0:48:25,94
and you do friends and family and then you do an angel,


1027
0:48:25,94 --> 0:48:26,7
like that's normal.


1028
0:48:26,7 --> 0:48:28,59
As soon as you have something weird, you're like woah.


1029
0:48:28,59 --> 0:48:30,68
There's like two different companies and one had some investment


1030
0:48:30,68 --> 0:48:32,77
and one had others and the cap table is like too long and


1031
0:48:32,77 --> 0:48:34,13
there's like already multiple classes of stock,


1032
0:48:34,13 --> 0:48:37,9
right, as soon as it looked different basically


1033
0:48:37,9 --> 0:48:39,5
until we had enough traction to actually make it


1034
0:48:39,5 --> 0:48:41,27
worthwhile for investors to look beyond that,


1035
0:48:41,27 --> 0:48:42,33
no one would look beyond it.


1036
0:48:42,33 --> 0:48:44,76
So, we probably struggled for a year longer than we would


1037
0:48:44,76 --> 0:48:46,88
have otherwise because of that and I had no idea.


1038
0:48:46,88 --> 0:48:48,8
I had no idea that investors were kind of,


1039
0:48:48,8 --> 0:48:50,87
you know, were going to be like this but it was very difficult for


1040
0:48:50,87 --> 0:48:54,36
us to raise money because we had an unconventional structure.


1041
0:48:54,36 --> 0:48:56,98
And that kind of taught me an important


1042
0:48:56,98 --> 0:48:59,95
lesson which is startups - you know,


1043
0:48:59,95 --> 0:49:2,66
people say that startups should be innovative,


1044
0:49:2,66 --> 0:49:6,98
sort of the engines of innovation at a startup; completely wrong.


1045
0:49:6,98 --> 0:49:10,58
Startups must never innovate on anything


1046
0:49:10,58 --> 0:49:15,7
at all whatsoever except your one thing.


1047
0:49:15,7 --> 0:49:16,49
So the thing that you're doing,


1048
0:49:16,49 --> 0:49:18,89
your product, you pour all your innovation on that.


1049
0:49:18,89 --> 0:49:21,1
Everything else, it's got to be completely by the book,


1050
0:49:21,1 --> 0:49:22,26
completely cookie cutter.


1051
0:49:22,26 --> 0:49:25,18
You do not want to be smart about anything else


1052
0:49:25,18 --> 0:49:26,96
because it will just get in the way of it.


1053
0:49:26,96 --> 0:49:30,41
So when an engineer comes to you and says,


1054
0:49:30,41 --> 0:49:32,61
hey, Phil - maybe he won't call you Phil,


1055
0:49:32,61 --> 0:49:35,75
but this database we're using is really crappy.


1056
0:49:35,75 --> 0:49:37,4
I've got an idea for a totally better database that


1057
0:49:37,4 --> 0:49:39,6
I can write myself and it will totally be better for us.


1058
0:49:39,6 --> 0:49:40,43
I am going to write my database.


1059
0:49:40,43 --> 0:49:44,18
You say, no, we are going to use the boring database


1060
0:49:44,18 --> 0:49:46,8
off the shelf because that's good enough.


1061
0:49:46,8 --> 0:49:49,21
If you are passionate about writing a better database,


1062
0:49:49,21 --> 0:49:52,55
you go and start a database company and then you do that.


1063
0:49:52,55 --> 0:49:53,65
And if somebody else comes in and says,


1064
0:49:53,65 --> 0:49:55,99
hey, I've got a totally clever way that we can figure out our


1065
0:49:55,99 --> 0:49:58,9
stock options that are like not really how other people are doing


1066
0:49:58,9 --> 0:50:0,85
stock options because the way other people are doing them isn't


1067
0:50:0,85 --> 0:50:3,32
fair and I've got a better way of doing stock options.


1068
0:50:3,32 --> 0:50:5,66
You say, no, because that's going to make us un-fundable.


1069
0:50:5,66 --> 0:50:7,97
If you are passionate about a different way of doing stock options,


1070
0:50:7,97 --> 0:50:10,54
you go and start - I don't know,


1071
0:50:10,54 --> 0:50:13,49
well whatever, you're screwed, I guess.


1072
0:50:13,49 --> 0:50:17,21
So the mistake we made is we innovated in the initial structure


1073
0:50:17,21 --> 0:50:36,51
of the company which is not something that I would repeat. Please.


1074
0:50:36,51 --> 0:50:38,167
The question to you is,


1075
0:50:38,167 --> 0:50:44,667
in a world that's accelerating so fast why would you not countenance


1076
0:50:44,667 --> 0:50:49,708
or why would somebody like me who's giving away the money not countenance


1077
0:50:49,708 --> 0:50:53,104
somebody who is innovating in a number of degrees,


1078
0:50:53,104 --> 0:50:57,25
granted their main innovation is their concept.


1079
0:50:57,25 --> 0:50:58,83
Where I'm fascinated would be to bring


1080
0:50:58,83 --> 0:51:2,38
me different kinds of structures,


1081
0:51:2,38 --> 0:51:5,83
like say a flat structure? I love that.


1082
0:51:5,83 --> 0:51:9,99
You're up. So the question is as someone who self-proclaimed


1083
0:51:9,99 --> 0:51:10,87
has more money than God,


1084
0:51:10,87 --> 0:51:20,89
which is a - that's great - oh, behind you, okay.


1085
0:51:20,89 --> 0:51:22,42
My motivation for having a thoughtful


1086
0:51:22,42 --> 0:51:30,28
answer decreased all of a sudden.


1087
0:51:30,28 --> 0:51:33,31
Why wouldn't somebody want innovation in multiple areas


1088
0:51:33,31 --> 0:51:35,21
including things like structuring the company?


1089
0:51:35,21 --> 0:51:37,77
Well, you know, I think they would, right.


1090
0:51:37,77 --> 0:51:41,29
I think, obviously, if you are an investor,


1091
0:51:41,29 --> 0:51:43,41
you want innovation everywhere you can get it, right.


1092
0:51:43,41 --> 0:51:44,79
Because there's always - every time you see it,


1093
0:51:44,79 --> 0:51:46,19
there is always a very good chance that like,


1094
0:51:46,19 --> 0:51:47,69
yeah, this could be the thing that's really big.


1095
0:51:47,69 --> 0:51:50,74
In fact, maybe it's the auxiliary innovation that turns out to


1096
0:51:50,74 --> 0:51:54,56
be the much bigger idea than the actual company, absolutely.


1097
0:51:54,56 --> 0:51:58,77
If you are running the company and


1098
0:51:58,77 --> 0:51:59,94
which is the position that I am in,


1099
0:51:59,94 --> 0:52:1,85
then especially if you're running the company like


1100
0:52:1,85 --> 0:52:4,18
I did with a whole bunch of brilliant people,


1101
0:52:4,18 --> 0:52:6,0
then your number one enemy is distraction, right.


1102
0:52:6,0 --> 0:52:8,13
Because there is an infinite number of great ideas


1103
0:52:8,13 --> 0:52:10,25
and an infinite number of things that they can improve


1104
0:52:10,25 --> 0:52:13,6
and it's keeping that tight focus is super hard,


1105
0:52:13,6 --> 0:52:15,69
especially super hard when you're working with people like I always


1106
0:52:15,69 --> 0:52:21,4
am that are smarter than I am and it's tough but that's why,


1107
0:52:21,4 --> 0:52:24,3
so it's basically a question of focus.


1108
0:52:24,3 --> 0:52:28,739
Please in the back. I'm interested about your...


1109
0:52:28,739 --> 0:52:32,866
Sorry, so how about you first and then... Me? Yes please.


1110
0:52:32,866 --> 0:52:36,627
I'm interested in your prior experiences with Evernote


1111
0:52:36,627 --> 0:52:43,763
where at ATG and Engine 5 more consumer,


1112
0:52:43,763 --> 0:52:51,52
was that a hard transition to make?


1113
0:52:51,52 --> 0:52:54,6
So the question was, was it difficult to make the transition


1114
0:52:54,6 --> 0:52:57,51
from Engine 5 and ATG and CoreStreet,


1115
0:52:57,51 --> 0:52:59,11
which was an enterprise focus to Evernote,


1116
0:52:59,11 --> 0:53:0,7
which was a consumer focus.


1117
0:53:0,7 --> 0:53:4,42
Yeah, yeah, it was - it's quite difficult,


1118
0:53:4,42 --> 0:53:10,43
but it's a huge amount of fun and I wasn't - I wasn't - I was


1119
0:53:10,43 --> 0:53:14,6
never really motivated by doing things that were easy.


1120
0:53:14,6 --> 0:53:19,4
I am extremely motivated by not doing anything boring,


1121
0:53:19,4 --> 0:53:22,79
by not putting myself in environments where I'm bored,


1122
0:53:22,79 --> 0:53:27,2
where I'm - I have to interact with people that I'd rather not interact


1123
0:53:27,2 --> 0:53:30,71
with on a regular basis and you find a lot more of that when you


1124
0:53:30,71 --> 0:53:32,83
are dealing with governments and banks and businesses than you


1125
0:53:32,83 --> 0:53:35,81
do when you're - when you have smart investors and you're building


1126
0:53:35,81 --> 0:53:40,52
consumer products because the test of fire right is are people


1127
0:53:40,52 --> 0:53:45,22
using it and the gap between like somebody at Evernote has a great


1128
0:53:45,22 --> 0:53:47,75
idea and they tell me about it and we're like oh yeah that's really


1129
0:53:47,75 --> 0:53:49,75
exciting and we kind of work on it.


1130
0:53:49,75 --> 0:53:52,6
The time from that to a million people are in love with it,


1131
0:53:52,6 --> 0:53:55,4
it's like - it's a few months and that's just - that is


1132
0:53:55,4 --> 0:53:59,43
so personally gratifying that just that in and of itself


1133
0:53:59,43 --> 0:54:2,78
makes all of the other difficulties worthwhile.


1134
0:54:2,78 --> 0:54:5,71
It's much harder to bullshit 100 million consumers


1135
0:54:5,71 --> 0:54:8,69
than it is a giant federal agency.


1136
0:54:8,69 --> 0:54:13,49
So to me that's a lot - it's a lot more challenging but a lot more fun.


1137
0:54:13,49 --> 0:54:15,73
And also if you're concerned about making money,


1138
0:54:15,73 --> 0:54:18,38
the valuation multiples you get are much higher,


1139
0:54:18,38 --> 0:54:22,46
so I think you can actually - you're probably better off even


1140
0:54:22,46 --> 0:54:25,66
if you are financially motivated to be doing consumer stuff.


1141
0:54:25,66 --> 0:54:28,96
Sorry, yeah. I am a big fan of the product.


1142
0:54:28,96 --> 0:54:31,22
I have been using it about two years and I think my favorite


1143
0:54:31,22 --> 0:54:33,5
thing about it is how it's evolved from a place for me to


1144
0:54:33,5 --> 0:54:36,34
take notes to ever since people have gotten more tablets


1145
0:54:36,34 --> 0:54:39,55
and smartphones a way to sync between all my devices.


1146
0:54:39,55 --> 0:54:41,83
Can you talk more about the product itself and its evolution


1147
0:54:41,83 --> 0:54:44,68
over the few years and also what you see it moving towards


1148
0:54:44,68 --> 0:54:47,7
in the future in terms of future technologies as well as


1149
0:54:47,7 --> 0:54:50,18
the trends in social and the sharing space?


1150
0:54:50,18 --> 0:54:54,72
So the question was about the future evolution of Evernote


1151
0:54:54,72 --> 0:54:57,79
especially around social and tablets and other experiences.


1152
0:54:57,79 --> 0:55:0,98
Well, at a high level our goal with Evernote


1153
0:55:0,98 --> 0:55:4,81
is to be 100% buzzword compliant.


1154
0:55:4,81 --> 0:55:7,55
So whenever the important new buzzwords come around,


1155
0:55:7,55 --> 0:55:12,33
whether it's social or tablet or at some point it'll be olfactory,


1156
0:55:12,33 --> 0:55:17,95
that's going to be a big thing, we'll be like, yes, we are there.


1157
0:55:17,95 --> 0:55:22,23
At a higher level, we got extreme - somebody actually


1158
0:55:22,23 --> 0:55:23,75
asked me recently in an interview like,


1159
0:55:23,75 --> 0:55:28,2
how did you guys predict the success of smartphones and tablets,


1160
0:55:28,2 --> 0:55:31,29
because in 2007 actually it wasn't - it wasn't successful.


1161
0:55:31,29 --> 0:55:32,12
How did you guys predict it?


1162
0:55:32,12 --> 0:55:34,85
And I said, well, we didn't predict it, we bet on it.


1163
0:55:34,85 --> 0:55:37,3
We made a fairly foolish gamble.


1164
0:55:37,3 --> 0:55:38,67
It's like how did you guys predict that


1165
0:55:38,67 --> 0:55:40,98
it would come out 35 black if it did.


1166
0:55:40,98 --> 0:55:45,71
Well, we didn't. We just bet on it. And we got lucky. We bet right.


1167
0:55:45,71 --> 0:55:48,86
We bet right that smartphones were going to be huge.


1168
0:55:48,86 --> 0:55:50,54
We didn't even know about app stores.


1169
0:55:50,54 --> 0:55:53,75
We just got really lucky on that. We bet right on tablets.


1170
0:55:53,75 --> 0:55:56,8
As soon as we heard about the iPad we were like yeah we're on that -


1171
0:55:56,8 --> 0:55:59,7
I think my official quote I got contacted at that point I think by,


1172
0:55:59,7 --> 0:56:1,13
I forget which magazine,


1173
0:56:1,13 --> 0:56:4,2
they wanted quotes from CEOs about whether or not


1174
0:56:4,2 --> 0:56:6,81
you're thinking of supporting the new iPad, the new Apple tablet.


1175
0:56:6,81 --> 0:56:9,3
This was like when Apple first announced it but it was a few months


1176
0:56:9,3 --> 0:56:11,78
before they launched it and they ran this article with quotes from


1177
0:56:11,78 --> 0:56:13,62
other CEOs and the quotes were all like very nuanced,


1178
0:56:13,62 --> 0:56:16,63
there was like a paragraph or two about well we think


1179
0:56:16,63 --> 0:56:18,77
this and this and it will be exciting to see this.


1180
0:56:18,77 --> 0:56:22,31
And my quote was, I was quoted in print saying,


1181
0:56:22,31 --> 0:56:25,34
"Yeah, we're going to support the hell out of it."


1182
0:56:25,34 --> 0:56:28,6
In fact, like the day that they - Apple announced it,


1183
0:56:28,6 --> 0:56:30,99
obviously couldn't get them ahead of time or anything but they


1184
0:56:30,99 --> 0:56:34,37
published the physical dimensions and so we had cardboard.


1185
0:56:34,37 --> 0:56:36,28
We cut out cardboard into the perfect physical


1186
0:56:36,28 --> 0:56:37,92
dimensions of an iPad and we like,


1187
0:56:37,92 --> 0:56:40,86
we carried around these like cardboard iPads and


1188
0:56:40,86 --> 0:56:42,61
that's how we built the whole interaction design,


1189
0:56:42,61 --> 0:56:44,49
like we put them in and out of our bags, we carried them.


1190
0:56:44,49 --> 0:56:47,65
We like Photoshopped pieces of paper with like where new elements


1191
0:56:47,65 --> 0:56:50,26
could go and we stuck it on there and we tried to figure out


1192
0:56:50,26 --> 0:56:53,27
well do my thumbs go here or do they go there and like we


1193
0:56:53,27 --> 0:56:58,24
just - we bet on this being huge and it paid out.


1194
0:56:58,24 --> 0:57:1,69
In fact, I didn't see Evernote running on the iPad until


1195
0:57:1,69 --> 0:57:4,0
I stood in line with everyone else and got the first iPad


1196
0:57:4,0 --> 0:57:6,76
and saw how it actually runs pretty well on it,


1197
0:57:6,76 --> 0:57:11,19
better than it did on cardboard,


1198
0:57:11,19 --> 0:57:17,51
although the cardboard was lighter and it had better battery life.


1199
0:57:17,51 --> 0:57:21,73
And on social, we actually went the other way. We went anti-social.


1200
0:57:21,73 --> 0:57:24,56
So our pitch in 2007 was, Evernote is anti-social,


1201
0:57:24,56 --> 0:57:26,38
because everyone else at that point was doing Facebook,


1202
0:57:26,38 --> 0:57:28,78
Facebook for dogs or something and we said - we said,


1203
0:57:28,78 --> 0:57:31,99
no, no, Evernote doesn't care about your friends.


1204
0:57:31,99 --> 0:57:33,69
Evernote cares about you.


1205
0:57:33,69 --> 0:57:36,21
Evernote cares about what's in your head and we want


1206
0:57:36,21 --> 0:57:38,0
users that have substantive things in their heads.


1207
0:57:38,0 --> 0:57:40,81
We don't care about how you - what your friend's dog feels,


1208
0:57:40,81 --> 0:57:41,96
is it depressed today or not.


1209
0:57:41,96 --> 0:57:45,26
And that actually worked really well for us.


1210
0:57:45,26 --> 0:57:48,21
Now we've actually added a whole bunch of sharing and collaboration functionality


1211
0:57:48,21 --> 0:57:50,78
into it and we are intending to do a lot more than that.


1212
0:57:50,78 --> 0:57:52,21
In terms of the future goal,


1213
0:57:52,21 --> 0:57:56,25
it's a 100-year company and I only have the plans


1214
0:57:56,25 --> 0:57:57,82
locked down for the next 20 or 30 years.


1215
0:57:57,82 --> 0:58:2,74
So there is still a lot of uncertainty but in a nutshell,


1216
0:58:2,74 --> 0:58:5,64
we are going - we are making this very perilous transition right now


1217
0:58:5,64 --> 0:58:11,7
from a single app to a family of products around your memories.


1218
0:58:11,7 --> 0:58:12,52
So by the end of the year,


1219
0:58:12,52 --> 0:58:15,35
we'll actually have several products available


1220
0:58:15,35 --> 0:58:16,85
that all work with your same account,


1221
0:58:16,85 --> 0:58:18,11
your same memory, your same thoughts


1222
0:58:18,11 --> 0:58:19,88
but that do different things with it.


1223
0:58:19,88 --> 0:58:23,98
And the main idea is to go from this unstructured mass


1224
0:58:23,98 --> 0:58:27,23
of memory and then incrementally add intelligence and structure


1225
0:58:27,23 --> 0:58:30,25
to it to actually let you do specific things.


1226
0:58:30,25 --> 0:58:33,46
But there is still obviously lots of ways that that can go but


1227
0:58:33,46 --> 0:58:37,1
that's the high level picture of the long term direction.


1228
0:58:37,1 --> 0:58:37,84
Please.


1229
0:58:37,84 --> 0:58:39,93
So with Apple launching iCloud for the office use,


1230
0:58:39,93 --> 0:58:43,13
it is going to be a very similar platform to what Evernote is.


1231
0:58:43,13 --> 0:58:45,7
How do you think that's going to affect your market in the future?


1232
0:58:45,7 --> 0:58:46,8
Well, it's hard to say.


1233
0:58:46,8 --> 0:58:52,68
I think the rule of thumb is - I think the rule of thumb in Silicon


1234
0:58:52,68 --> 0:58:55,9
Valley is if Apple features you 13 times in the keynote that they


1235
0:58:55,9 --> 0:58:58,8
don't plan on putting you out of business for at least a year.


1236
0:58:58,8 --> 0:59:0,67
So, I think we have at least a year where


1237
0:59:0,67 --> 0:59:2,17
we don't have to worry about it.


1238
0:59:2,17 --> 0:59:5,6
I actually think - so every time Apple releases anything,


1239
0:59:5,6 --> 0:59:6,18
you never know, right.


1240
0:59:6,18 --> 0:59:7,71
You never know is it good for you or is it bad for you.


1241
0:59:7,71 --> 0:59:9,33
It's always been great for us.


1242
0:59:9,33 --> 0:59:12,78
So the - just the preponderance of evidence is every time


1243
0:59:12,78 --> 0:59:16,59
Apple does something that gets more people using smartphones


1244
0:59:16,59 --> 0:59:18,78
or tablets or into the cloud or with App Stores,


1245
0:59:18,78 --> 0:59:19,72
it always works out great.


1246
0:59:19,72 --> 0:59:22,81
You never know how long that's going to hold up.


1247
0:59:22,81 --> 0:59:24,1
I actually don't think there is anything in


1248
0:59:24,1 --> 0:59:27,18
iCloud that's actually similar to Evernote.


1249
0:59:27,18 --> 0:59:29,18
We don't really care about storage so much.


1250
0:59:29,18 --> 0:59:32,55
In fact we were thinking of - we have got some really nice


1251
0:59:32,55 --> 0:59:35,8
ideas about how we're going to work with iCloud to make other


1252
0:59:35,8 --> 0:59:38,41
iCloud apps a whole lot better and more interesting.


1253
0:59:38,41 --> 0:59:41,8
So I don't think there is a particular iCloud threat but that's


1254
0:59:41,8 --> 0:59:43,4
not to say that there is not some threat somewhere,


1255
0:59:43,4 --> 0:59:46,6
maybe by Apple, maybe by Google,


1256
0:59:46,6 --> 0:59:48,33
more likely by someone we've never heard of.


1257
0:59:48,33 --> 0:59:52,98
But we do have a very specific philosophy about competition


1258
0:59:52,98 --> 0:59:57,2
which is in all of my previous companies and in the companies


1259
0:59:57,2 --> 1:0:0,55
that I've worked with or at in the past,


1260
1:0:0,55 --> 1:0:6,57
we always had a list of our enemies, we always had like, oh,


1261
1:0:6,57 --> 1:0:8,63
those guys, we always had like a list of people


1262
1:0:8,63 --> 1:0:10,55
that like that's our nemesis right there.


1263
1:0:10,55 --> 1:0:12,38
And like we are going to crush those guys.


1264
1:0:12,38 --> 1:0:13,81
We've always had that,


1265
1:0:13,81 --> 1:0:17,17
one or two companies and it turned out it never mattered,


1266
1:0:17,17 --> 1:0:20,89
never, not once - not once did the people that we focused on in


1267
1:0:20,89 --> 1:0:24,3
the competition actually significantly play a role in terms


1268
1:0:24,3 --> 1:0:27,7
of the success or failure of our company a few years later.


1269
1:0:27,7 --> 1:0:28,61
It was always something else.


1270
1:0:28,61 --> 1:0:30,39
And so with Evernote we decided explicitly -


1271
1:0:30,39 --> 1:0:32,4
again because we are not that smart,


1272
1:0:32,4 --> 1:0:34,61
it takes us three times to actually figure this out,


1273
1:0:34,61 --> 1:0:38,55
we said explicitly we aren't going to look at competition.


1274
1:0:38,55 --> 1:0:39,39
We're not going to look at it.


1275
1:0:39,39 --> 1:0:40,47
We are not going to pay attention to it.


1276
1:0:40,47 --> 1:0:41,55
Not because we are not threatened,


1277
1:0:41,55 --> 1:0:43,65
of course we are threatened but because


1278
1:0:43,65 --> 1:0:45,38
looking at it doesn't help you,


1279
1:0:45,38 --> 1:0:46,58
it doesn't actually make your product better.


1280
1:0:46,58 --> 1:0:47,72
The only way that you can win,


1281
1:0:47,72 --> 1:0:50,78
the only way to increase your chances of actually succeeding is just


1282
1:0:50,78 --> 1:0:55,5
to make a great product and you don't do that by looking behind you.


1283
1:0:55,5 --> 1:0:57,91
You do that by typing and looking at a screen.


1284
1:0:57,91 --> 1:0:59,65
And so we don't look at it.


1285
1:0:59,65 --> 1:1:2,3
We don't think about things that might potentially disrupt us.


1286
1:1:2,3 --> 1:1:3,62
We do think a lot about partners and how


1287
1:1:3,62 --> 1:1:5,26
we can work together and we have an API,


1288
1:1:5,26 --> 1:1:6,92
we have about 7,000 partners.


1289
1:1:6,92 --> 1:1:10,7
Many of them started as competitors but then wound up working


1290
1:1:10,7 --> 1:1:16,1
in the ecosystem but ultimately the competitive threat I don't


1291
1:1:16,1 --> 1:1:20,63
think is in the top 20 threats to a company at this stage.


1292
1:1:20,63 --> 1:1:22,21
And especially for of you guys,


1293
1:1:22,21 --> 1:1:24,17
if you are thinking of being entrepreneurs,


1294
1:1:24,17 --> 1:1:28,92
I think if you sort of lay out the possible things that can go wrong,


1295
1:1:28,92 --> 1:1:29,75
that can kill your company,


1296
1:1:29,75 --> 1:1:33,33
just like write them out in order of probability.


1297
1:1:33,33 --> 1:1:35,5
The probability of your company failing because some


1298
1:1:35,5 --> 1:1:38,59
competitor beats you is not in the top five.


1299
1:1:38,59 --> 1:1:43,16
It's probably not even in the top ten for early stage.


1300
1:1:43,16 --> 1:1:44,42
And anything that's not in the top five,


1301
1:1:44,42 --> 1:1:46,69
like you don't have time to think about it.


1302
1:1:46,69 --> 1:1:50,55
So my advice is don't even bother.


1303
1:1:50,55 --> 1:1:53,276
Please, in the aisle.


1304
1:1:53,276 --> 1:1:58,59
My question is about switching over from kind of paper to electronic.


1305
1:1:58,59 --> 1:2:1,54
So as somebody who signed up for Evernote - well a long


1306
1:2:1,54 --> 1:2:5,0
time ago but haven't used it very much because I really


1307
1:2:5,0 --> 1:2:9,12
value having like my notes, my plan on paper.


1308
1:2:9,12 --> 1:2:11,13
What's your take on like switching those


1309
1:2:11,13 --> 1:2:12,84
people over - like I use smartphones,


1310
1:2:12,84 --> 1:2:15,7
I use my laptop, I just haven't been able to kind of


1311
1:2:15,7 --> 1:2:17,43
sync those two so what are your thoughts on that?


1312
1:2:17,43 --> 1:2:20,66
Phil, this will be the last question. Okay, so last question.


1313
1:2:20,66 --> 1:2:23,27
Sorry and the question was about paper and how we


1314
1:2:23,27 --> 1:2:26,66
switch people over from using paper to Evernote.


1315
1:2:26,66 --> 1:2:27,57
So that's a really great question.


1316
1:2:27,57 --> 1:2:29,73
So the short answer is what I recommend,


1317
1:2:29,73 --> 1:2:32,19
what I do myself is I take a lot of notes on paper


1318
1:2:32,19 --> 1:2:34,44
because I love my moleskin notebook and a nice pen,


1319
1:2:34,44 --> 1:2:39,23
I kind of have a pen fetish and I'll take notes and I'll just take


1320
1:2:39,23 --> 1:2:42,39
a picture of the page with my iPhone in Evernote and that's to me


1321
1:2:42,39 --> 1:2:44,42
that's the best of both worlds because I get to take the notes,


1322
1:2:44,42 --> 1:2:47,48
it's unobtrusive, I get the notebook but it's also in Evernote,


1323
1:2:47,48 --> 1:2:49,6
it's synchronized, it's stored forever and it will


1324
1:2:49,6 --> 1:2:53,3
actually find as long as I write like a title, the notes roll across,


1325
1:2:53,3 --> 1:2:54,84
I can actually use Evernote to find those notes


1326
1:2:54,84 --> 1:2:56,93
because of our handwriting recognition.


1327
1:2:56,93 --> 1:2:58,94
So to me that actually works really well.


1328
1:2:58,94 --> 1:3:1,85
In fact Mashable - no,


1329
1:3:1,85 --> 1:3:4,83
not Mashable, Lifehacker does a survey every year where they


1330
1:3:4,83 --> 1:3:8,1
ask people like what's your favorite note-taking tool.


1331
1:3:8,1 --> 1:3:9,58
And they did it like the first time like


1332
1:3:9,58 --> 1:3:11,48
three years ago and it's like Evernote,


1333
1:3:11,48 --> 1:3:15,8
Microsoft OneNote, a bunch of other stuff and paper and always,


1334
1:3:15,8 --> 1:3:18,99
every single year it's like we are the most popular


1335
1:3:18,99 --> 1:3:21,1
app like by far but paper always beat us,


1336
1:3:21,1 --> 1:3:23,58
it's always like pen and paper is number one and then Evernote


1337
1:3:23,58 --> 1:3:26,13
and then like everyone else is far behind and this has


1338
1:3:26,13 --> 1:3:27,81
happened for years and for years we were like,


1339
1:3:27,81 --> 1:3:35,205
oh paper, it's our nemesis. But this year they just did it - they just


1340
1:3:35,205 --> 1:3:42,23
did it a month ago and we beat paper.


1341
1:3:42,23 --> 1:3:48,925
 


1342
1:3:48,925 --> 1:3:49,125
 


1343
1:3:49,125 --> 1:3:49,325
 


1344
1:3:49,325 --> 1:3:49,525
 


1345
1:3:49,525 --> 1:5:49,525
