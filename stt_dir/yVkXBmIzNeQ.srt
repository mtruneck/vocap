0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:3,59



2
0:0:3,59 --> 0:0:4,59
STEVE SPANGLER: Well, every
once in a while we have a


3
0:0:4,59 --> 0:0:6,28
special guest that stops by.


4
0:0:6,28 --> 0:0:8,7
And you'll never guess who
showed up today in our special


5
0:0:8,7 --> 0:0:12,51
kind of Post-it Note studio
look back here, like this.


6
0:0:12,51 --> 0:0:14,92
Rainn Wilson, creator
of SoulPancake.


7
0:0:14,92 --> 0:0:16,43
It's so cool that
you stopped by.


8
0:0:16,43 --> 0:0:18,5
RAINN WILSON: Thanks for
having me, Steve.


9
0:0:18,5 --> 0:0:19,85
STEVE SPANGLER: So for people
that don't know what


10
0:0:19,85 --> 0:0:22,6
SoulPancake is all about, tell
us about the website.


11
0:0:22,6 --> 0:0:22,89
RAINN WILSON: Sure.


12
0:0:22,89 --> 0:0:27,36
SoulPancake is a website where
users can explore life's big


13
0:0:27,36 --> 0:0:28,83
questions--


14
0:0:28,83 --> 0:0:34,24
philosophy, creativity,
spirituality, really dig into


15
0:0:34,24 --> 0:0:35,74
what it is to be
a human being.


16
0:0:35,74 --> 0:0:38,61
And we've also got an awesome
new YouTube channel.


17
0:0:38,61 --> 0:0:40,61
Check that out.


18
0:0:40,61 --> 0:0:40,98
STEVE SPANGLER: You're right.


19
0:0:40,98 --> 0:0:43,2
You do want to check
out that link.


20
0:0:43,2 --> 0:0:43,65
Let's--


21
0:0:43,65 --> 0:0:45,392
Are you OK?


22
0:0:45,392 --> 0:0:48,66
RAINN WILSON: [GROANING]


23
0:0:48,66 --> 0:0:50,48
STEVE SPANGLER: So give us
an example of some of the


24
0:0:50,48 --> 0:0:52,41
questions that you would have,
maybe, on the website.


25
0:0:52,41 --> 0:0:54,64
Like for example, give us a
question that you would do on


26
0:0:54,64 --> 0:0:58,15
the website, and then I'll
answer it using science.


27
0:0:58,15 --> 0:0:59,2
RAINN WILSON: OK.


28
0:0:59,2 --> 0:1:2,59
For instance, since you're
a scientist, love.


29
0:1:2,59 --> 0:1:4,68
What happens when you
fall in love?


30
0:1:4,68 --> 0:1:8,99
Like literally, scientifically,
in your brain,


31
0:1:8,99 --> 0:1:12,9
what happens when you
fall in love?


32
0:1:12,9 --> 0:1:14,0
STEVE SPANGLER: When
you fall in love.


33
0:1:14,0 --> 0:1:17,1
Well, that's a little bit
deeper than I thought.


34
0:1:17,1 --> 0:1:17,97
But that's-- oh!


35
0:1:17,97 --> 0:1:18,54
Check this out.


36
0:1:18,54 --> 0:1:19,23
You're going to love this.


37
0:1:19,23 --> 0:1:19,66
Watch this.


38
0:1:19,66 --> 0:1:22,95
Did you know that you can
balance a bubble on your hand


39
0:1:22,95 --> 0:1:25,13
if you're wearing
a cotton glove?


40
0:1:25,13 --> 0:1:26,13
RAINN WILSON: Did
not know that.


41
0:1:26,13 --> 0:1:28,51
But what does that have to do
the question I just asked?


42
0:1:28,51 --> 0:1:29,4
STEVE SPANGLER: Don't
worry about it.


43
0:1:29,4 --> 0:1:29,33
Here.


44
0:1:29,33 --> 0:1:30,9
Take this glove here.


45
0:1:30,9 --> 0:1:31,27
Put this glove on.


46
0:1:31,27 --> 0:1:32,15
OK?


47
0:1:32,15 --> 0:1:32,91
Put it on.


48
0:1:32,91 --> 0:1:34,29
Stretch it on.


49
0:1:34,29 --> 0:1:35,41
So now, here, watch this.


50
0:1:35,41 --> 0:1:37,3
Now, you get some
bubble solution.


51
0:1:37,3 --> 0:1:39,23
It's just like glycerin
and soap.


52
0:1:39,23 --> 0:1:41,24
And because of the semi-perm--


53
0:1:41,24 --> 0:1:42,6
don't worry about that.


54
0:1:42,6 --> 0:1:45,49
So here's what you're going
to do, is you just blow


55
0:1:45,49 --> 0:1:46,56
a bubble like this.


56
0:1:46,56 --> 0:1:49,1
And now watch.


57
0:1:49,1 --> 0:1:49,56
See that?


58
0:1:49,56 --> 0:1:52,25
It's the oil in your hands that
will typically pop it.


59
0:1:52,25 --> 0:1:54,475
But because of the glove
here, it doesn't pop.


60
0:1:54,475 --> 0:1:55,19
Here, hold out your hand.


61
0:1:55,19 --> 0:1:56,53
I'll give to you.


62
0:1:56,53 --> 0:1:57,8
Here, watch this.


63
0:1:57,8 --> 0:1:57,91
Here, ready?


64
0:1:57,91 --> 0:1:59,17
Hold it there like that.


65
0:1:59,17 --> 0:2:2,46
Take it.


66
0:2:2,46 --> 0:2:3,71
Oh!


67
0:2:3,71 --> 0:2:5,5



68
0:2:5,5 --> 0:2:6,66
RAINN WILSON: What was that?


69
0:2:6,66 --> 0:2:8,699
STEVE SPANGLER: It just
has to be smaller.


70
0:2:8,699 --> 0:2:9,419
Watch this.


71
0:2:9,419 --> 0:2:10,8
And don't be afraid of it.


72
0:2:10,8 --> 0:2:11,28
So here, watch this.


73
0:2:11,28 --> 0:2:12,74
Hold out your hand.


74
0:2:12,74 --> 0:2:13,43
Hold out your hand.


75
0:2:13,43 --> 0:2:13,65
Ready?


76
0:2:13,65 --> 0:2:14,43
It's OK.


77
0:2:14,43 --> 0:2:15,18
Just take it.


78
0:2:15,18 --> 0:2:16,43
Take it.


79
0:2:16,43 --> 0:2:20,64



80
0:2:20,64 --> 0:2:22,26
Awesome, huh?


81
0:2:22,26 --> 0:2:24,22
RAINN WILSON: It's magical.


82
0:2:24,22 --> 0:2:26,818
Wow.


83
0:2:26,818 --> 0:2:27,75
STEVE SPANGLER: Look, look.


84
0:2:27,75 --> 0:2:28,54
It's there.


85
0:2:28,54 --> 0:2:29,21
Look.


86
0:2:29,21 --> 0:2:29,86
Watch.


87
0:2:29,86 --> 0:2:32,78
Watch this.


88
0:2:32,78 --> 0:2:34,1
Recycling.


89
0:2:34,1 --> 0:2:35,12
Is that awesome?


90
0:2:35,12 --> 0:2:36,3
RAINN WILSON: You know what?


91
0:2:36,3 --> 0:2:37,65
That is really cool.


92
0:2:37,65 --> 0:2:39,25
But again, what does this have
to do with the question?


93
0:2:39,25 --> 0:2:39,53
STEVE SPANGLER: I know.


94
0:2:39,53 --> 0:2:41,3
But it's fine.


95
0:2:41,3 --> 0:2:42,35
I just want to show you
some other things.


96
0:2:42,35 --> 0:2:43,35
Oh, you're going to love this.


97
0:2:43,35 --> 0:2:43,97
Here watch.


98
0:2:43,97 --> 0:2:44,51
So here.


99
0:2:44,51 --> 0:2:45,42
Roll up my sleeves.


100
0:2:45,42 --> 0:2:46,61
Watch.


101
0:2:46,61 --> 0:2:48,0
This is called an
energy stick.


102
0:2:48,0 --> 0:2:51,13
And so I put a battery here, and
there's some LEDs in here.


103
0:2:51,13 --> 0:2:53,8
But when I touch this end,
nothing happens.


104
0:2:53,8 --> 0:2:54,1
But when I complete
the circuit--


105
0:2:54,1 --> 0:2:54,85
[BUZZING]


106
0:2:54,85 --> 0:2:55,24
Look at that.


107
0:2:55,24 --> 0:2:57,49
The electrons flow on my skin.


108
0:2:57,49 --> 0:2:59,365
Your skin is a human conductor
of electricity.


109
0:2:59,365 --> 0:3:0,19
Got it?


110
0:3:0,19 --> 0:3:0,55
So here.


111
0:3:0,55 --> 0:3:1,26
Watch.


112
0:3:1,26 --> 0:3:2,38
I'm just going to hold
onto this end.


113
0:3:2,38 --> 0:3:3,31
You just hold onto that.


114
0:3:3,31 --> 0:3:3,57
It's OK.


115
0:3:3,57 --> 0:3:4,7
Touch it.


116
0:3:4,7 --> 0:3:6,16
So nothing happens.


117
0:3:6,16 --> 0:3:7,4
So now, but watch.


118
0:3:7,4 --> 0:3:9,23
If we touch our hands together
like this-- just touch.


119
0:3:9,23 --> 0:3:9,725
[BUZZING]


120
0:3:9,725 --> 0:3:10,22
See?


121
0:3:10,22 --> 0:3:10,65
RAINN WILSON: Wow.


122
0:3:10,65 --> 0:3:10,89
STEVE SPANGLER: It goes off.


123
0:3:10,89 --> 0:3:11,67
RAINN WILSON: Impressive.


124
0:3:11,67 --> 0:3:13,1
STEVE SPANGLER: Now,
if I touch your


125
0:3:13,1 --> 0:3:14,43
shirt, it doesn't work.


126
0:3:14,43 --> 0:3:15,54
See how it doesn't work?


127
0:3:15,54 --> 0:3:17,472
But if I touch your nose,
here, watch this.


128
0:3:17,472 --> 0:3:18,92
[BUZZING]


129
0:3:18,92 --> 0:3:19,87
See?


130
0:3:19,87 --> 0:3:20,22
RAINN WILSON: OK.


131
0:3:20,22 --> 0:3:22,55
But you know what, Steve, I'm
beginning to think that you're


132
0:3:22,55 --> 0:3:26,68
actually avoiding my question
that I posed to you.


133
0:3:26,68 --> 0:3:28,51
STEVE SPANGLER: Not really.


134
0:3:28,51 --> 0:3:29,77
I'll answer your question
like this.


135
0:3:29,77 --> 0:3:30,48
Here, watch.


136
0:3:30,48 --> 0:3:31,48
See this?


137
0:3:31,48 --> 0:3:32,44
Grab onto that.


138
0:3:32,44 --> 0:3:33,82
Now hold it out like this.


139
0:3:33,82 --> 0:3:34,99
Here, listen to this.


140
0:3:34,99 --> 0:3:37,29
Hello!


141
0:3:37,29 --> 0:3:37,65
OK.


142
0:3:37,65 --> 0:3:38,3
Stretch it out.


143
0:3:38,3 --> 0:3:38,5
Yes.


144
0:3:38,5 --> 0:3:39,26
Stretch.


145
0:3:39,26 --> 0:3:40,42
Now listen to this.


146
0:3:40,42 --> 0:3:41,4
Choo, choo, choo.


147
0:3:41,4 --> 0:3:41,88
See, it's vibration.


148
0:3:41,88 --> 0:3:42,982
[VIBRATION SOUNDS]


149
0:3:42,982 --> 0:3:45,18
STEVE SPANGLER: Luke,
I am your father!


150
0:3:45,18 --> 0:3:47,85
RAINN WILSON: That is actually
pretty cool.


151
0:3:47,85 --> 0:3:51,5
But I think that you're not
answering my question, and so


152
0:3:51,5 --> 0:3:52,96
I should probably just go.


153
0:3:52,96 --> 0:3:54,87
Thank you.


154
0:3:54,87 --> 0:3:55,47
STEVE SPANGLER: No, no.


155
0:3:55,47 --> 0:3:56,3
It's fine.


156
0:3:56,3 --> 0:3:56,78
I'll answer your question.


157
0:3:56,78 --> 0:3:57,29
I'll answer it.


158
0:3:57,29 --> 0:3:58,9
So here's the answer.


159
0:3:58,9 --> 0:3:59,9
The science of love.


160
0:3:59,9 --> 0:4:2,94
Here's what happens.


161
0:4:2,94 --> 0:4:4,19
Dopamine.


162
0:4:4,19 --> 0:4:6,5



163
0:4:6,5 --> 0:4:8,35
So it's this stuff
that secreted.


164
0:4:8,35 --> 0:4:10,1
It's like do-- and
the receptors--


165
0:4:10,1 --> 0:4:10,69
OK, here.


166
0:4:10,69 --> 0:4:11,75
Watch.


167
0:4:11,75 --> 0:4:12,9
So here, watch this.


168
0:4:12,9 --> 0:4:13,85
Pretend like this
is your brain.


169
0:4:13,85 --> 0:4:15,43
See, your brain's right here.


170
0:4:15,43 --> 0:4:17,29
These are my rusty
ball bearings.


171
0:4:17,29 --> 0:4:19,54
And so this is like
your brain.


172
0:4:19,54 --> 0:4:20,279
And this is a receptor.


173
0:4:20,279 --> 0:4:21,81
And this is like dopamine.


174
0:4:21,81 --> 0:4:23,6
And when you fall
in love, there's


175
0:4:23,6 --> 0:4:24,68
this release of dopamine.


176
0:4:24,68 --> 0:4:26,77
And when it hits those
receptors, bam!


177
0:4:26,77 --> 0:4:27,32
Like that.


178
0:4:27,32 --> 0:4:28,3
It's just psh!


179
0:4:28,3 --> 0:4:28,4
Psh!


180
0:4:28,4 --> 0:4:29,22
Psh!


181
0:4:29,22 --> 0:4:31,48
It's like fireworks going
off in your brain.


182
0:4:31,48 --> 0:4:31,8
Psh!


183
0:4:31,8 --> 0:4:32,88
I'm in love!


184
0:4:32,88 --> 0:4:33,195
Psh!


185
0:4:33,195 --> 0:4:34,3
I'm in love!


186
0:4:34,3 --> 0:4:34,6
Psh!


187
0:4:34,6 --> 0:4:36,61
But there's more,
phenylethylamine.


188
0:4:36,61 --> 0:4:38,45
It's a natural amphetamine
that gets


189
0:4:38,45 --> 0:4:39,42
released in your body.


190
0:4:39,42 --> 0:4:40,96
And here, watch.


191
0:4:40,96 --> 0:4:44,14
It's kind of like this mood
that you can set the mood.


192
0:4:44,14 --> 0:4:47,15
You know, like that feeling that
you get, the butterflies


193
0:4:47,15 --> 0:4:48,14
in your stomach.


194
0:4:48,14 --> 0:4:51,94
And it's this love feeling.


195
0:4:51,94 --> 0:4:53,19
That's what it's like.


196
0:4:53,19 --> 0:4:54,456
It's like love.


197
0:4:54,456 --> 0:4:57,87
And that's what gets released
into your body.


198
0:4:57,87 --> 0:4:59,24
And you feel it.


199
0:4:59,24 --> 0:5:1,13
You know how you feel
sick when you're


200
0:5:1,13 --> 0:5:1,8
in love with somebody?


201
0:5:1,8 --> 0:5:4,9
Well, that's that feeling
of that PEA, as the


202
0:5:4,9 --> 0:5:6,2
professionals call it.


203
0:5:6,2 --> 0:5:8,34
But there's more,
noradrenalin.


204
0:5:8,34 --> 0:5:10,2
Now, this is a special
thing that gets


205
0:5:10,2 --> 0:5:11,3
released in your body.


206
0:5:11,3 --> 0:5:11,92
This isn't really it.


207
0:5:11,92 --> 0:5:12,48
It's something else.


208
0:5:12,48 --> 0:5:14,99
But the idea is this, it gets
released in your body and it


209
0:5:14,99 --> 0:5:16,78
gives you that emergency
state.


210
0:5:16,78 --> 0:5:19,39
And by itself, psh,
nothing at all.


211
0:5:19,39 --> 0:5:22,44
But when it gets mixed with the
secretions of the dopamine


212
0:5:22,44 --> 0:5:24,53
and the phenylethylamine,
watch this.


213
0:5:24,53 --> 0:5:25,18
It's crazy!


214
0:5:25,18 --> 0:5:26,79
It's like fire everywhere.


215
0:5:26,79 --> 0:5:28,31
It's like love!


216
0:5:28,31 --> 0:5:29,71
And everybody's in love.


217
0:5:29,71 --> 0:5:30,94
And these things get released.


218
0:5:30,94 --> 0:5:34,2
And there's these other things
that are released, but it


219
0:5:34,2 --> 0:5:35,31
doesn't really matter, because
when you've got


220
0:5:35,31 --> 0:5:36,7
this, you've got fire.


221
0:5:36,7 --> 0:5:40,91
And this lasts, and you'll be in
love for about six months.


222
0:5:40,91 --> 0:5:43,31
And then it all goes away.


223
0:5:43,31 --> 0:5:46,9
And you'd better hope that
football kicks in.


224
0:5:46,9 --> 0:5:48,64
See, but scientists figured
out that after this lust


225
0:5:48,64 --> 0:5:51,33
molecule and fire and everything
is gone, then


226
0:5:51,33 --> 0:5:55,14
something else kicks in called
the cuddle hormone.


227
0:5:55,14 --> 0:5:59,51
And this is what keeps couples
together over the years.


228
0:5:59,51 --> 0:6:1,1
And it's there.


229
0:6:1,1 --> 0:6:2,63
And it's oxytocin.


230
0:6:2,63 --> 0:6:6,5
And it's found in women, and
especially in monogamous


231
0:6:6,5 --> 0:6:6,73
relationships.


232
0:6:6,73 --> 0:6:9,11
They had voles, and they studied
the top part of the


233
0:6:9,11 --> 0:6:12,28
brain and found this high
concentration of the oxytocin.


234
0:6:12,28 --> 0:6:14,29
But vasoprin was found in men.


235
0:6:14,29 --> 0:6:16,58
And so that's how this
monogamous relationship can


236
0:6:16,58 --> 0:6:20,32
kind of keep it going on
for years and years.


237
0:6:20,32 --> 0:6:21,89
Like the marriage counselor
said, it's going to


238
0:6:21,89 --> 0:6:23,2
keep going and going.


239
0:6:23,2 --> 0:6:24,3
But that's kind of-- whatever.


240
0:6:24,3 --> 0:6:24,98
That's the difference.


241
0:6:24,98 --> 0:6:28,12
But that's kind of how you
understand this whole thing.


242
0:6:28,12 --> 0:6:29,6
RAINN WILSON: Wow.


243
0:6:29,6 --> 0:6:30,97
Boom.


244
0:6:30,97 --> 0:6:31,85
Amazing.


245
0:6:31,85 --> 0:6:33,16
Thank you so much, Steve.


246
0:6:33,16 --> 0:6:34,766
That was incredible.


247
0:6:34,766 --> 0:6:35,7
OK.


248
0:6:35,7 --> 0:6:37,43
Now, what does this string do?


249
0:6:37,43 --> 0:6:38,83
STEVE SPANGLER: No, don't
touch the string.


250
0:6:38,83 --> 0:6:39,74
I'm s--


251
0:6:39,74 --> 0:6:40,544
don't.


252
0:6:40,544 --> 0:6:41,75
Don't!


253
0:6:41,75 --> 0:6:43,75
Do not pull the string.


254
0:6:43,75 --> 0:6:44,14
I'm s--


255
0:6:44,14 --> 0:6:45,35
I'm begging you!


256
0:6:45,35 --> 0:6:46,6
Do not--


257
0:6:46,6 --> 0:6:51,772



258
0:6:51,772 --> 0:6:53,22
RAINN WILSON: Sorry
about that.


259
0:6:53,22 --> 0:6:57,81



260
0:6:57,81 --> 0:6:59,6
STEVE SPANGLER: Thanks
for stopping by.


261
0:6:59,6 --> 0:7:1,775



262
0:7:1,775 --> 0:7:2,475
All right.


263
0:7:2,475 --> 0:7:4,65
Somebody's going to have
to clean this up.


264
0:7:4,65 --> 0:7:6,59
Higginsworth!


265
0:7:6,59 --> 0:7:7,84
Higginsworth.


266
0:7:7,84 --> 0:9:7,84
