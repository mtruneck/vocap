Word up Food Tubers, Mister Oliver here. Okay.
We're making perfect porridge because we love


2
0:0:9,59 --> 0:0:11,3
it.
I want to give you a recipe that's rock solid,


3
0:0:11,3 --> 0:0:15,0
I want to kind of arc back to the more kind
of traditional porridge that I think is more


4
0:0:15,0 --> 0:0:18,92
delicious than the rush jobs we can get these
days. And also I'm going to five you some


5
0:0:18,92 --> 0:0:22,8
ideas of ways you can serve it so you don't
get bored!


6
0:0:22,8 --> 0:0:27,83
We want a high sided pot. We want it on a
medium heat. I'm going to use large builders


7
0:0:27,83 --> 0:0:34,239
mug here. I'm going to use the course porridge
oats. This is really, really nice. Instead


8
0:0:34,239 --> 0:0:38,51
of the kind of more commercialised ones that
cook quicker. Okay, I'm going to for these


9
0:0:38,51 --> 0:0:46,48
because I think strongly that they taste better.
One builders mug is perfect for four people.


10
0:0:46,48 --> 0:0:52,51
I'm going to follow that by three builders
mugs of water.


11
0:0:52,51 --> 0:0:59,64
There's one, two, three.
Get that onto a simmer. You want a nice pinch


12
0:0:59,64 --> 0:1:5,7
of sea salt, very, very important. this is
the kind of classic Scottish way to do it.


13
0:1:5,7 --> 0:1:12,289
Water, three parts to one part beautiful lovely
organise rolled porridge oats. Also, I'm using


14
0:1:12,289 --> 0:1:17,709
the back end of a wooden spoon. But they would
have it almost slightly more ornate. Like


15
0:1:17,709 --> 0:1:22,979
a drumstick. And embellishments at the end
they would hold, like that. Just stir it like


16
0:1:22,979 --> 0:1:27,159
this. A little bit thicker than this and that
was called a spurtle okay? Right and I brought


17
0:1:27,159 --> 0:1:28,759
that to boil okay, now let's just have a look
at that.


18
0:1:28,759 --> 0:1:33,349
Now let's turn it right down. We don't want
to rush it. I now want to cook that for 10


19
0:1:33,349 --> 0:1:38,49
15 minutes. So it goes from being grains of
rolled oats to this beautiful homogeneous,


20
0:1:38,49 --> 0:1:43,419
thick, non lumpy porridge.
A lot of people cook porridge with milk. Milk


21
0:1:43,419 --> 0:1:48,869
or cream scalds of burns really easily. And
also if it boils over and goes on the cooking


22
0:1:48,869 --> 0:1:52,27
range its really hard to clean and it stinks
the house out.


23
0:1:52,27 --> 0:1:57,579
So look, it's only been cooking for five minutes
at this stage but its already gone from being


24
0:1:57,579 --> 0:2:2,439
flaky and just water to being gloopy and those
flakes are starting to break down.


25
0:2:2,439 --> 0:2:7,29
Now let's just have a look here, the reason
that parents have loved this for years. It's


26
0:2:7,29 --> 0:2:11,52
nutritiously great for you, it burns slowly,
if you want to share this on your social media


27
0:2:11,52 --> 0:2:16,299
please do! And if you haven't subscribed to
Food Tube, press that button. Yes I said press


28
0:2:16,299 --> 0:2:21,89
that button.
It's had about 13 minutes. Nothings stuck


29
0:2:21,89 --> 0:2:26,379
to the butter, which I don't but some of the
old recipes do can.


30
0:2:26,379 --> 0:2:33,42
if you want to add milk you can put a little
splash in now and just loosen it.


31
0:2:33,42 --> 0:2:40,43
In my view it should be thick but still oozy.
Don't overload it at this point. Feel free


32
0:2:40,43 --> 0:2:45,81
to just add a little honey or a little sugar
just to kind of take that edge of savouriness


33
0:2:45,81 --> 0:2:48,689
off.
So that's very, very nice. So that#'s our


34
0:2:48,689 --> 0:2:53,92
basic porridge.
So let's just portion that out. Nice and thick.


35
0:2:53,92 --> 0:2:56,7
I want to show you how I would mix up that
flavour.


36
0:2:56,7 --> 0:3:1,209
What happens in the Oliver household is we
either have the brown sugar and if you put


37
0:3:1,209 --> 0:3:5,29
the brown sugar and leave it for a minute,
it almost goes like a little kind of caramel


38
0:3:5,29 --> 0:3:10,26
so leave it for a minute. This one here, the
traditional one is golden syrup. You can get


39
0:3:10,26 --> 0:3:13,29
it in quite a few countries around the world.
Very very British.


40
0:3:13,29 --> 0:3:20,98
Okay, then we've got really nice poppy seeds
like that. dessicated coconut, a little pinch


41
0:3:20,98 --> 0:3:27,89
of cinnamon not too much and a banana just
mash up. Really, really nice. So mix that


42
0:3:27,89 --> 0:3:33,799
up in there and we can just finish that up
with a few bananas and some honey.


43
0:3:33,799 --> 0:3:38,109
Very nice. One of the things my wife does
is just a one minute stewed fruit. Just throw


44
0:3:38,109 --> 0:3:43,29
a handful into a bowl. Just add a little bit
of sugar of the fruits really good and in


45
0:3:43,29 --> 0:3:48,31
season you won't really need it. If it's a
little bit more sour add a little sugar. Just


46
0:3:48,31 --> 0:3:55,28
mush up and squash it and the natural juices
will come out of this. Amazing. And this with


47
0:3:55,28 --> 0:4:0,579
any fruit is amazing,
Make a little well in the pop the whole fruit


48
0:4:0,579 --> 0:4:4,34
in there and look at that beautiful juice
that's come out there.


49
0:4:4,34 --> 0:4:8,29
We've got one more to go.
Hot chocolate, it's not actually much chocolate


50
0:4:8,29 --> 0:4:17,68
by weight I'm mixing it up into our bowl.
Chocolate porridge with a little spoonful


51
0:4:17,68 --> 0:4:23,25
of sweet and bitter marmalade.
That my friends, is amazing! If you look at


52
0:4:23,25 --> 0:4:28,75
the classic for a minute, my granddad used
to put a little gully in here like this and


53
0:4:28,75 --> 0:4:35,77
then pour in Milk so it went all the way down.
And then at that point, he would tuck into


54
0:4:35,77 --> 0:4:39,59
it.
So guys, that is the tip of the iceberg okay?


55
0:4:39,59 --> 0:4:44,61
Happy porridge cooking, now you might be thinking
that's rubbish, my one's better, everyone


56
0:4:44,61 --> 0:4:48,77
should know about it, and we want to know
about it. So guys enjoy, lots of love, until


57
0:4:48,77 --> 0:6:48,77
next time. Shamoan.
