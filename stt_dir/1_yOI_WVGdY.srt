[MODEM CONNECTING]


3
0:0:5,22 --> 0:0:7,76
SHANE SMITH NARRATING: We first
met Ben Anderson when we


4
0:0:7,76 --> 0:0:9,15
started VBS, actually.


5
0:0:9,15 --> 0:0:12,63
We went to Spike Jonze, our
creative director's, house


6
0:0:12,63 --> 0:0:15,82
along with some of the most
talented editors and shooters


7
0:0:15,82 --> 0:0:18,68
and talent that Spike
had put together.


8
0:0:18,68 --> 0:0:22,2
All we did was watch Ben
Anderson footage from Africa,


9
0:0:22,2 --> 0:0:24,2
North Korea-- which I then
ripped off when I went to


10
0:0:24,2 --> 0:0:25,25
North Korea--


11
0:0:25,25 --> 0:0:26,47
Iran, Iraq.


12
0:0:26,47 --> 0:0:28,0
It was just fascinating stuff.


13
0:0:28,0 --> 0:0:31,26
He ended up getting in a fight
and Johnny Knoxville had to go


14
0:0:31,26 --> 0:0:34,36
save him and sneak
him into a club.


15
0:0:34,36 --> 0:0:36,92
And since then, we've been
wanting to work with Ben, and


16
0:0:36,92 --> 0:0:39,18
we knew that he had been working
in Afghanistan for the


17
0:0:39,18 --> 0:0:41,49
past three years on making
a documentary there.


18
0:0:41,49 --> 0:0:43,98
And lately, Afghanistan's
been in the news.


19
0:0:43,98 --> 0:0:47,25
And you know, we're spending
more and more money there.


20
0:0:47,25 --> 0:0:49,9
We're losing more
and more ground.


21
0:0:49,9 --> 0:0:51,8
And generally what we've found
with VBS is what you hear the


22
0:0:51,8 --> 0:0:55,9
mainstream media versus what is
actually happening are two


23
0:0:55,9 --> 0:0:56,21
completely different things.


24
0:0:56,21 --> 0:0:58,21
So what he showed us
blew our minds.


25
0:0:58,21 --> 0:1:0,6
I mean, it's completely
insane.


26
0:1:0,6 --> 0:1:1,79
And it's also very complex.


27
0:1:1,79 --> 0:1:5,19
So we wanted him to come over
and explain to us what we're


28
0:1:5,19 --> 0:1:6,44
about to see.


29
0:1:6,44 --> 0:1:24,53



30
0:1:24,53 --> 0:1:26,75
BRITISH SOLDIER: You'll want
to keep the bottles.


31
0:1:26,75 --> 0:1:29,37
You can fill the bottles up
using either stream water, or


32
0:1:29,37 --> 0:1:31,405
when you go into compound
from the well.


33
0:1:31,405 --> 0:1:32,63
Yeah, this is normally
confusion.


34
0:1:32,63 --> 0:1:34,11
They all gather round.


35
0:1:34,11 --> 0:1:36,19
He wants a lot of water for
himself, and he says he's


36
0:1:36,19 --> 0:1:38,64
going to sort it out, but if you
give it to him, he'll just


37
0:1:38,64 --> 0:1:39,135
fuck off with the lot.


38
0:1:39,135 --> 0:1:41,961
So nothing would
get sorted out.


39
0:1:41,961 --> 0:1:44,55
He'll just fill his vehicle
and noone will get none.


40
0:1:44,55 --> 0:1:46,83
So you have to sort it
out between them.


41
0:1:46,83 --> 0:1:47,97
Like kids.


42
0:1:47,97 --> 0:1:49,7
SHANE SMITH NARRATING: That
guy's the British Army and the


43
0:1:49,7 --> 0:1:51,8
other guys are--?


44
0:1:51,8 --> 0:1:52,39
BEN ANDERSON NARRATING:
Afghan National Army.


45
0:1:52,39 --> 0:1:53,59
SHANE SMITH NARRATING:
Afghan National Army.


46
0:1:53,59 --> 0:1:54,9
BEN ANDERSON NARRATING:
And that's


47
0:1:54,9 --> 0:1:55,97
basically our exit strategy.


48
0:1:55,97 --> 0:1:58,33
The idea is when these guys
can stand up and provide


49
0:1:58,33 --> 0:2:1,51
security on their own,
we can all get out.


50
0:2:1,51 --> 0:2:2,58
SHANE SMITH NARRATING: But
they can't even give them


51
0:2:2,58 --> 0:2:4,6
water without them
taking it away.


52
0:2:4,6 --> 0:2:5,24
SHANE SMITH NARRATING: No, they
can't even get them to


53
0:2:5,24 --> 0:2:8,264
wear their helmets
and flak jackets.


54
0:2:8,264 --> 0:2:10,885
BEN ANDERSON: Seems like quite
a chaotic start, then.


55
0:2:10,885 --> 0:2:11,65
BRITISH SOLDIER: This is good.


56
0:2:11,65 --> 0:2:12,5
BEN ANDERSON: Is it?


57
0:2:12,5 --> 0:2:15,605
BRITISH SOLDIER: This is
fucking squared away.


58
0:2:15,605 --> 0:2:17,59
They've got vehicles
and everything.


59
0:2:17,59 --> 0:2:19,894
It's well done.


60
0:2:19,894 --> 0:2:22,13
BEN ANDERSON: How difficult is
it to organize these guys?


61
0:2:22,13 --> 0:2:23,2
BRITISH SOLDIER: It just
takes a bit of time.


62
0:2:23,2 --> 0:2:23,77
They're all mad.


63
0:2:23,77 --> 0:2:26,22
They all want to go on the
mission, but they're not fully


64
0:2:26,22 --> 0:2:27,22
functioning yet.


65
0:2:27,22 --> 0:2:28,91
They need us to mentor them and
make sure they've got all


66
0:2:28,91 --> 0:2:30,145
the kit and equipment
they need.


67
0:2:30,145 --> 0:2:31,91
They'll go without water
and without food and


68
0:2:31,91 --> 0:2:33,42
hope for the best.


69
0:2:33,42 --> 0:2:34,48
They think we can manage--


70
0:2:34,48 --> 0:2:37,37
magic things up, just invent
things and produce a fuel


71
0:2:37,37 --> 0:2:38,67
truck for them.


72
0:2:38,67 --> 0:2:39,9
But we can't.


73
0:2:39,9 --> 0:2:43,35
When we come into contact with
the enemy, sometimes you need


74
0:2:43,35 --> 0:2:45,17
to put them on a lead and hold
them back, 'cause they'll just


75
0:2:45,17 --> 0:2:47,46
go and go and go until they kill
more and more Taliban.


76
0:2:47,46 --> 0:2:48,47
That's what they want to do.


77
0:2:48,47 --> 0:2:50,25
That's what their life is.


78
0:2:50,25 --> 0:2:51,44
SHANE SMITH NARRATING: So I
know there's problems in


79
0:2:51,44 --> 0:2:54,45
Pakistan with Muslim
fighting Muslim.


80
0:2:54,45 --> 0:2:58,52
Why would the ANA fight
the Taliban?


81
0:2:58,52 --> 0:2:59,95
BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: I think
to them, it's work.


82
0:2:59,95 --> 0:3:2,7
It's not ideology at all.


83
0:3:2,7 --> 0:3:3,8
And there's an old saying--


84
0:3:3,8 --> 0:3:5,746
I think you can hire an
Afghan army, but you


85
0:3:5,746 --> 0:3:6,99
can never buy one.


86
0:3:6,99 --> 0:3:7,15
SHANE SMITH NARRATING: Right.


87
0:3:7,15 --> 0:3:7,742
BEN ANDERSON NARRATING:
So loyalty is


88
0:3:7,742 --> 0:3:9,35
never taken for granted.


89
0:3:9,35 --> 0:3:10,24
BRITISH SOLDIER: They
are excited and


90
0:3:10,24 --> 0:3:11,58
they are brave soldiers.


91
0:3:11,58 --> 0:3:14,65
And they're like children.


92
0:3:14,65 --> 0:3:17,6
Their attention span doesn't
last very long.


93
0:3:17,6 --> 0:3:19,326
They soon get bored.


94
0:3:19,326 --> 0:3:22,2
At the moment, I think
they're all here.


95
0:3:22,2 --> 0:3:23,712
Clint Eastwood is.


96
0:3:23,712 --> 0:3:25,128
BEN ANDERSON: In
the cowboy hat?


97
0:3:25,128 --> 0:3:25,6
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


98
0:3:25,6 --> 0:3:27,488
BEN ANDERSON: How you doing?


99
0:3:27,488 --> 0:3:31,57
Have you given up on making them
wear uniform exactly the


100
0:3:31,57 --> 0:3:32,365
way they're supposed
to wear it?


101
0:3:32,365 --> 0:3:33,23
BRITISH SOLDIER: No,
I don't care.


102
0:3:33,23 --> 0:3:35,21
As long as they go and do the
job and do what they're told


103
0:3:35,21 --> 0:3:35,8
and they toe the line.


104
0:3:35,8 --> 0:3:37,79
You know, they enjoy wearing
their shemaghs and t-shirts


105
0:3:37,79 --> 0:3:40,7
and looking like Rambo
when they go out.


106
0:3:40,7 --> 0:3:40,98
I'm not bothered.


107
0:3:40,98 --> 0:3:42,577
As long as they've got their
weapon, their ammunition, all


108
0:3:42,577 --> 0:3:45,92
the stuff they need to sustain
themselves, I'm not bothered.


109
0:3:45,92 --> 0:3:48,136
BRITISH SOLDIER: They're so--


110
0:3:48,136 --> 0:3:50,78
so bright and colorful,
all of them.


111
0:3:50,78 --> 0:3:52,5
It's a wonderful
sight, really.


112
0:3:52,5 --> 0:3:54,93
They're a very sort
of visual army.


113
0:3:54,93 --> 0:3:56,18
It's great.


114
0:3:56,18 --> 0:3:58,5



115
0:3:58,5 --> 0:4:0,27
BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: So in
the past, the problem and the


116
0:4:0,27 --> 0:4:3,106
criticism has always been that
the Brits, Americans, whoever


117
0:4:3,106 --> 0:4:7,17
it is, just control towns or
bases, and they're isolated.


118
0:4:7,17 --> 0:4:9,335
Isolated from the community,
and the Taliban can roll


119
0:4:9,335 --> 0:4:11,217
around freely in the rest
of the country, apart


120
0:4:11,217 --> 0:4:13,4
from these big bases.


121
0:4:13,4 --> 0:4:15,65
The aim of this mission was to
actually clear ground of the


122
0:4:15,65 --> 0:4:18,49
Taliban and then hold on to it
for the first time, actually


123
0:4:18,49 --> 0:4:19,959
keep hold of that land
and stop the


124
0:4:19,959 --> 0:4:21,709
Taliban from coming back.


125
0:4:21,709 --> 0:4:24,5



126
0:4:24,5 --> 0:4:26,75
BRITISH SOLDIER: With this
amount of manpower, we should


127
0:4:26,75 --> 0:4:29,806
have enough, tomorrow, to commit
to a good scrap with


128
0:4:29,806 --> 0:4:32,56
the enemy if they choose
to take on with us.


129
0:4:32,56 --> 0:4:35,375
We aim to destroy the enemy and
take the ground this time,


130
0:4:35,375 --> 0:4:37,741
and not cede it again.


131
0:4:37,741 --> 0:4:39,29
BRITISH SOLDIER: If they can
get forward, destroy the


132
0:4:39,29 --> 0:4:42,1
Taliban, and hold that ground,
it's a massive morale booster


133
0:4:42,1 --> 0:4:43,42
for the ANA and for our boys.


134
0:4:43,42 --> 0:4:44,67
So, you know, that's what we're


135
0:4:44,67 --> 0:4:45,92
looking forward to doing.


136
0:4:45,92 --> 0:4:53,21



137
0:4:53,21 --> 0:4:55,155
BEN ANDERSON: Did they know
exactly where they were going?


138
0:4:55,155 --> 0:4:57,31
BRITISH SOLDIER: They know the
general region, yeah, because


139
0:4:57,31 --> 0:4:57,87
they have to know.


140
0:4:57,87 --> 0:5:1,99
But we try and keep security
to a minimum so we can--


141
0:5:1,99 --> 0:5:3,64
otherwise they'll get on the
mobile phone, start phoning


142
0:5:3,64 --> 0:5:4,671
everyone around the [INAUDIBLE]
they know, and


143
0:5:4,671 --> 0:5:6,94
then they'll pass it
on to the Taliban.


144
0:5:6,94 --> 0:5:8,49
BEN ANDERSON: So there's a worry
that some of the solders


145
0:5:8,49 --> 0:5:10,89
might intentionally be giving
information to the Taliban?


146
0:5:10,89 --> 0:5:11,61
BRITISH SOLDIER: Yeah, people
have been caught out


147
0:5:11,61 --> 0:5:12,36
before in the ANA.


148
0:5:12,36 --> 0:5:14,68
And they've been disciplined
in their own chain.


149
0:5:14,68 --> 0:5:16,2
BEN ANDERSON: And remained
within the ANA?


150
0:5:16,2 --> 0:5:17,55
BRITISH SOLDIER: No, they've
been kicked out of the ANA.


151
0:5:17,55 --> 0:5:21,1
They probably went and joined
the Taliban, but.


152
0:5:21,1 --> 0:5:24,49
SHANE SMITH NARRATING: The ANA,
the Afghan National Army,


153
0:5:24,49 --> 0:5:26,3
they can't tell them where
they're going because they'll


154
0:5:26,3 --> 0:5:27,8
call the Taliban and
let them know?


155
0:5:27,8 --> 0:5:29,1
BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: And tell
them where they're going,


156
0:5:29,1 --> 0:5:29,89
what the plan is.


157
0:5:29,89 --> 0:5:31,45
SHANE SMITH NARRATING: Why in
god's name would they do that?


158
0:5:31,45 --> 0:5:32,93
BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: Because
the Taliban pay much


159
0:5:32,93 --> 0:5:36,45
better salary than any
government job-- police, army,


160
0:5:36,45 --> 0:5:37,93
whatever it is.


161
0:5:37,93 --> 0:5:39,82
SHANE SMITH NARRATING: So they
pay them, and then they say,


162
0:5:39,82 --> 0:5:41,52
oh, we're coming here now.


163
0:5:41,52 --> 0:5:41,94
Kill us.


164
0:5:41,94 --> 0:5:43,82
BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: Yeah.


165
0:5:43,82 --> 0:5:47,52
So this is what all of Helmand
is like, just desert.


166
0:5:47,52 --> 0:5:49,45
But then the area where the
fighting is, is called the


167
0:5:49,45 --> 0:5:50,195
green zone.


168
0:5:50,195 --> 0:5:52,86
And completely opposite to the
Iraq green zone, it's the most


169
0:5:52,86 --> 0:5:55,275
dangerous place, because it's
the one fertile strip of land


170
0:5:55,275 --> 0:5:57,46
there, and there are so many
hiding places for the Taliban


171
0:5:57,46 --> 0:5:58,92
that that's where they
love to fight.


172
0:5:58,92 --> 0:6:1,62
And that's where the British and
the ANA have to go looking


173
0:6:1,62 --> 0:6:3,11
for the Taliban.


174
0:6:3,11 --> 0:6:4,907
SHANE SMITH NARRATING:
Green zone, bad zone.


175
0:6:4,907 --> 0:6:6,22
BEN ANDERSON: Yeah.


176
0:6:6,22 --> 0:6:8,25
BRITISH SOLDIER: They've watched
us so far, last hour


177
0:6:8,25 --> 0:6:9,44
and a half, two hours.


178
0:6:9,44 --> 0:6:10,21
BEN ANDERSON: Everyone
knows we're here?


179
0:6:10,21 --> 0:6:11,14
BRITISH SOLDIER: Yeah.


180
0:6:11,14 --> 0:6:14,14
They knew there was an upcoming,
because they're used


181
0:6:14,14 --> 0:6:16,79
to it, and they'd have
gone, right, OK.


182
0:6:16,79 --> 0:6:20,75
Seeing us go that way, Taliban
go that way to


183
0:6:20,75 --> 0:6:23,35
their fall-back positions.


184
0:6:23,35 --> 0:6:25,33
And it's a waiting game.


185
0:6:25,33 --> 0:6:27,52
We'll outnumber them, we'll
out-firepower them.


186
0:6:27,52 --> 0:6:28,24
And they know that.


187
0:6:28,24 --> 0:6:30,37
And they will stand and fight
sooner or later, because


188
0:6:30,37 --> 0:6:31,66
they'll have to.


189
0:6:31,66 --> 0:6:33,68
Because that's what they do.


190
0:6:33,68 --> 0:6:34,44
BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: The
Taliban have got a really


191
0:6:34,44 --> 0:6:36,295
sophisticated network
of dickers.


192
0:6:36,295 --> 0:6:38,9
It's a phrase that comes
from Northern Island.


193
0:6:38,9 --> 0:6:40,45
Local people with mobile phones,
as soon as they see


194
0:6:40,45 --> 0:6:42,975
us, as soon as they see the
soldiers coming, they'll tell


195
0:6:42,975 --> 0:6:43,84
them exactly our movement.


196
0:6:43,84 --> 0:6:46,79
So the Brits take it for granted
the Taliban know their


197
0:6:46,79 --> 0:6:49,88
every movement.


198
0:6:49,88 --> 0:6:51,675
You see us walking through
this town, and


199
0:6:51,675 --> 0:6:53,16
it's completely deserted.


200
0:6:53,16 --> 0:6:54,96
That's-- every single time
we got ambushed,


201
0:6:54,96 --> 0:6:55,78
this happened first.


202
0:6:55,78 --> 0:6:57,6
You'd walk around, completely
deserted.


203
0:6:57,6 --> 0:6:59,38
Because the civilians
are very streetwise.


204
0:6:59,38 --> 0:7:0,79
They know where the
Taliban are.


205
0:7:0,79 --> 0:7:2,19
They see the British
soldiers coming.


206
0:7:2,19 --> 0:7:3,6
They know there's going
to be a fight.


207
0:7:3,6 --> 0:7:4,93
So they get out of there.


208
0:7:4,93 --> 0:7:7,72
So as soon as you find an area
that's deserted, you know


209
0:7:7,72 --> 0:7:9,82
there's going to be fighting.


210
0:7:9,82 --> 0:7:11,68
BRITISH SOLDIER: All these
compounds make up


211
0:7:11,68 --> 0:7:13,15
the village of Kakara.


212
0:7:13,15 --> 0:7:15,31
We're just clearing
through them.


213
0:7:15,31 --> 0:7:17,2
It's a painstaking process.


214
0:7:17,2 --> 0:7:20,22
Did you expect it to
be this quiet?


215
0:7:20,22 --> 0:7:21,25
BRITISH SOLDIER: It swings
around about.


216
0:7:21,25 --> 0:7:22,5
Sometimes it is this quiet.


217
0:7:22,5 --> 0:7:25,5



218
0:7:25,5 --> 0:7:28,94
Other times you might meet
one or two people.


219
0:7:28,94 --> 0:7:31,32
By and large, because this area
has seen quite a bit of


220
0:7:31,32 --> 0:7:33,88
fighting over the last couple
of months, a lot of the


221
0:7:33,88 --> 0:7:35,23
families have moved out.


222
0:7:35,23 --> 0:7:38,75
But hopefully after the next
couple of days, we will have


223
0:7:38,75 --> 0:7:45,25
taken this area properly,
secured it, and sent a message


224
0:7:45,25 --> 0:7:47,215
that people can move back
into their compounds.

just about every single house

we went into had a pile of
harvested opium poppies as


231
0:7:59,34 --> 0:8:1,33
tall as you.


232
0:8:1,33 --> 0:8:3,97

Britain's heroin, comes from

0:8:7,54 --> 0:8:12,4



236
0:8:12,4 --> 0:8:13,605
BEN ANDERSON: The Afghan
National Army can use their


237
0:8:13,605 --> 0:8:16,314
radios to get on the same
channel as the Taliban and


238
0:8:16,314 --> 0:8:20,71
listen to what they're saying.

0:8:20,71 --> 0:8:21,37
What are they saying?

they are about to attack.


241
0:8:23,5 --> 0:8:26,86

246
0:8:30,835 --> 0:8:33,1
Their location is not known.


247
0:8:33,1 --> 0:8:35,669
Just they are asking where
[INAUDIBLE] located, where


248
0:8:35,669 --> 0:8:37,124
that relocating in
the morning.

you right then.

0:8:45,88 --> 0:8:46,5

0:8:46,5 --> 0:8:48,292
SHANE SMITH NARRATING:
Were you scared?


254
0:8:48,292 --> 0:8:50,1
BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: Yeah,
you're scared, but you get


255
0:8:50,1 --> 0:8:51,41
used to it very quickly.


256
0:8:51,41 --> 0:8:53,28
This is everyday life for
these guys out there.

SHANE SMITH NARRATING: How does
he know the Taliban know?


258
0:8:54,775 --> 0:8:56,37
BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: He's
just got a normal CB and he


259
0:8:56,37 --> 0:8:58,48
finds the same channel the
Taliban are speaking on.


260
0:8:58,48 --> 0:9:0,9
He hears them saying, OK, I can
see them, as soon as they


261
0:9:0,9 --> 0:9:2,53
come out of that street, as soon
as they come from behind


262
0:9:2,53 --> 0:9:4,59
that wall, we'll attack.

0:9:11,582 --> 0:9:26,75



268
0:9:26,75 --> 0:9:27,81
BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: So we'd
walked through the entire


269
0:9:27,81 --> 0:9:29,47
town, cleared the whole town.


270
0:9:29,47 --> 0:9:32,54
Really surprised not to see any
civilians, any Taliban.


271
0:9:32,54 --> 0:9:35,18
And almost the last building we
could see, there's a team


272
0:9:35,18 --> 0:9:37,55
of Taliban waiting there
to fire up on us.


273
0:9:37,55 --> 0:9:40,39
So as happens every single time,
the fight happens where


274
0:9:40,39 --> 0:9:42,55
they want it to happen.


275
0:9:42,55 --> 0:9:44,41
BRITISH SOLDIER: Possible
positive identification of two


276
0:9:44,41 --> 0:9:45,61
times Taliban.


277
0:9:45,61 --> 0:9:47,72
We're going to engage with RPGs,
see if it provokes a


278
0:9:47,72 --> 0:9:49,99
response, and if so, assault
that enemy possession.


279
0:9:49,99 --> 0:9:50,95
Over.


280
0:9:50,95 --> 0:9:51,46

281
0:9:51,46 --> 0:9:54,45

there, yeah?

0:10:1,62 --> 0:10:2,43
firing these RPGs.


285
0:10:2,43 --> 0:10:5,255
BEN ANDERSON: So we think it's
a sighting of two Taliban.


286
0:10:5,255 --> 0:10:7,23
And apparently what they'll
often do is send foot patrol


287
0:10:7,23 --> 0:10:10,72
down to harass, then run away
and lure British forces into a


288
0:10:10,72 --> 0:10:14,156
trap where they can be attacked
by 360 degrees.


289
0:10:14,156 --> 0:10:17,447
Just wait and see if there's a
response to the RPG that's


290
0:10:17,447 --> 0:10:18,41
just been fire.


291
0:10:18,41 --> 0:10:19,82
They're loading another
one now.


292
0:10:19,82 --> 0:10:21,49
BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: Yeah you
get a lot of stuff about


293
0:10:21,49 --> 0:10:22,927
how our poor soldiers
are getting bogged


294
0:10:22,927 --> 0:10:24,22
down in this quagmire.


295
0:10:24,22 --> 0:10:27,5
And the Brits know exactly
what's going on,


296
0:10:27,5 --> 0:10:27,825
and go ahead anyway.


297
0:10:27,825 --> 0:10:28,8
SHANE SMITH NARRATING: Right.


298
0:10:28,8 --> 0:10:29,256
Why?


299
0:10:29,256 --> 0:10:30,56
BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: Well,
they're quite happy to go


300
0:10:30,56 --> 0:10:31,58
there and have a fight
with them.


301
0:10:31,58 --> 0:10:35,54
They know they're walking
into a trap, but


302
0:10:35,54 --> 0:10:37,12
they're looking for it.

were going to send

happening is that the

0:11:40,892 --> 0:11:42,91
original four Taliban are trying
to push forward to the


329
0:11:42,91 --> 0:11:45,65

to our right, and that the

who are now off in
