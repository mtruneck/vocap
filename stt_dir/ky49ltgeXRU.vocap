###6 THOMAS MORTON: If there's anybody more excited about the
###8 impending '90s revival than us and Mudhoney frontman Mark
###10 Arm, it is the militia movement.
###13 Born out of the baby-ridden ashes of Waco and Ruby Ridge,
###17 groups of armed citizens, like the Tri-States Militia of
###19 South Dakota and Norm Olson's Michigan Militia, coalesced to
###22 the delight of hack TV reporters and editorial
###24 cartoonists worldwide.
###26 Though their depiction in the media typically ranged from
###28 hey, look at these kooky anti-government gun nuts to
###31 hey, look at these kooky anti-government racists, the
###34 movement's numbers grew and grew.
###37 They were even making inroads into mainstream politics until
###39 Tim McVeigh pulled off the ultimate PR coup by blowing up
###42 149 people and 19 children in Oklahoma City.
###45 
###48 Plagued by its association with the attack, the militia
###50 movement foundered, and as one of its most visible groups,
###53 the Michigan Militia bore the brunt of the shit storm.
###57 There were allegations that the Nichols brothers and
###59 McVeigh were members, brow-beatings at the hands of
###62 congressional pantywaists like Arlen Specter, and lively
###64 infighting by militia members upset over the leadership's
###67 alternative hypothesis for the bombing.
###71 The militia disbanded in the early '00s, and founders Norm
###74 Olson and Ray Southwell left Michigan for Alaska.
###77 While this seemed like the sad but likely end to their
###79 endeavor, according to a Homeland Security report
###82 earlier this year, militia activity, like ketamine and
###85 Docs with shorts, is once again on the hot list.
###88 And Norm and Ray are gearing up to hit the reunion circuit.
###90 RAY SOUTHWELL: How're you doing?
###91 THOMAS MORTON: Thomas.
###92 RAY SOUTHWELL: Thomas.
###92 THOMAS MORTON: How are you doing?
###93 RAY SOUTHWELL: Fine, fine.
###93 You're from the VBS TV, huh?
###95 THOMAS MORTON: Yes.
###96 RAY SOUTHWELL: Well, come on in.
###96 We've got a lot to talk about here.
###97 THOMAS MORTON: [LAUGHTER].
###98 RAY SOUTHWELL: [INAUDIBLE].
###100 THOMAS MORTON: Hi, I'm in Nikiski, Alaska, on the Kenai
###103 Peninsula with Norman Olson and Ray Southwell, formally of
###107 the Michigan Militia.
###108 Currently of the Alaska Militia.
###110 NORMAN OLSON: Hi, I'm Norman Olson, and a longtime
###114 proponent of the Constitution.
###117 20-year-plus military veteran.
###120 Standing by the red, white, and blue,
###123 no matter what happens.
###124 And telling it like it is.
###127 Michigan Militia from the very beginning.
###129 This goes back to, let's see.
###131 Dates--
###132 oh, 1994.
###136 Started the little militia in--
###139 in fact, this one goes back even earlier than that.
###144 "Patriots gather to rail against the 'New World
###146 Order.'" My, were we young then, huh?
###149 Year number one was what was called Operation Visibility.
###153 We knew that we had to become visible.
###155 If we didn't maintain our visibility, we couldn't
###157 maintain our legitimacy.
###158 It's so important that if you believe in what you're doing
###161 is right, you've got to stand up and make yourself visible.
###164 Look at that mean look on that man's face.
###167 Oh, boy.
###168 But we were just regulars, trying to point out that we're
###171 not the terrorists.
###172 We're counter-terrorists.
###173 We're going to stop those people that
###175 are destroying America.
###176 RAY SOUTHWELL: What we've always done with our militia--
###180 and this is what people don't understand, again--
###183 militias command information.
###186 So I may be a commander.
###188 My job is not to give you orders.
###190 My job as a commander is to give you information so that
###194 you sort that out in your own conscience and decide what
###198 action you should take.
###200 The army is command control.
###202 You're my soldier, I'm going to give you an order, and you
###205 better carry it out.
###207 An example, when you go back to the Revolutionary War,
###209 Washington had a heck of a time when the
###212 militia would show up.
###213 The militia was not command control.
###216 If these guys got there and they looked at that
###218 battlefield and they decided, this is not a battle worth
###221 fighting, they left.
###223 That's the way it is today, too.
###227 NORMAN OLSON: So we went fast all over the country, starting
###229 up militias in every state.
###231 Some of our militia training exercises brought in folks
###235 from all over the country.
###236 But we'd put on these training sessions, dog-and-pony shows,
###239 and the media loved that too.
###241 They came in from all over the world to see what we were
###243 doing, because it never happened before, since 1776,
###245 you know, of course.
###247 Or 1775, I should say, Lexington and Concord.
###252 And we were growing and getting
###254 more national exposure.
###257 RAY SOUTHWELL: Our goal was to unite these militias.
###260 And understand, there's militias all over the country,
###263 all over the peninsula, but they're small groups-- five
###265 people, ten people.
###267 So we networked with each other so we can be a unified
###270 force, a protective force, so we don't have to call upon the
###277 federal troops or Blackwater.
###280 THOMAS MORTON: It's important, it would seem to me, that it'd
###282 be as important in times of crisis or impending crisis as
###289 it is in times of well-being to have what the Second
###295 Amendment describes, which you're talking about-- an
###296 unorganized citizens' militia.
###297 
###300 How do you go about that in times when--
###304 NORMAN OLSON: In times of peace?
###305 THOMAS MORTON: Bingo.
###306 Of fatness, good--
###308 NORMAN OLSON: Here's the thing.
###308 When you put a life preserver on your child and you're going
###311 out on a lake, do you do it after?
###314 Or do you do it with the perception that something
###316 could happen out on the lake?
###317 Of course you do.
###318 You don't wait for your child to drown.
###321 You think ahead.
###322 You're frightened of the possible situation.
###325 That fear motivates you to do something good.
###329 So is the--
###329 RAY SOUTHWELL: Who would you rather trust?
###330 Your neighbor, or a stranger?
###332 NORMAN OLSON: Yeah.
###334 RAY SOUTHWELL: You know, that's--
###335 NORMAN OLSON: And when somebody comes rolling up your
###337 driveway, when the lights go out, would you be comforted if
###341 you knew it was your neighbors in it, bringing over a
###344 generator or bringing over foodstuffs, rather than a big,
###347 black SUV coming to take your guns away?
###351 Again, to keep the control.
###353 So the question is, who will come in to aid us?
###356 If we are well-disciplined and well-trained and
###357 well-equipped, then we can take care of
###360 ourselves, thank you.
###361 But you see, the media won't allow that to happen.
###363 The media has to spin it so that we are always demonized
###367 with misinformation and looked at as the bogeyman running
###371 around the woods with our cammies on, rather than people
###374 who can help and organize each other.
###379 It looks like Mark Farner.
###380 You know Mark Farner?
###381 THOMAS MORTON: Um, Grand Funk, right?
###382 NORMAN OLSON: Yeah, yeah.
###383 He's a personal friend of ours.
###383 THOMAS MORTON: Oh.
###384 Neat.
###384 NORMAN OLSON: Yeah, he's a good boy.
###386 THOMAS MORTON: Are you guys buddies with the Nuge?
###388 NORMAN OLSON: Oh yeah, you betcha.
###389 We did a program on the steps of the Capitol with Ted.
###393 Ray and I went out to Montana there, we went up to the FBI
###397 lines, and I was carrying a teddy bear, and Ray was
###400 carrying a Red Cross pack.
###402 What we want to do is humanize it, put a human face on it, so
###405 that those people wouldn't be bulldozed.
###407 Western New York that I helped, they were going to
###410 bulldoze his house trailer because it didn't comply with
###413 building codes.
###416 We went to help this old gentleman, bless his heart.
###419 Here's an old fellow that was--
###420 he was a construction worker in Northern Michigan, 87 years
###423 old, he and his wife.
###424 And they had all this old machinery on their property.
###426 Well, the county came out and said it was a blight and they
###428 had to remove it all.
###430 And so we went out there and faced down the sheriff and
###432 fought for him for a long time.
###434 The Stitt family.
###435 And they lived down a little island in northern Lake Huron,
###441 and they were being pushed off the island because they were
###443 preparing for Y2K.
###444 And they were raising chickens and emus and
###446 all sorts of stuff.
###448 THOMAS MORTON: Were they trying to grow hemp?
###449 NORMAN OLSON: I think so.
###450 Now I don't have anything bad to say about marijuana.
###452 To me, it's just like alcohol.
###455 All things in moderation.
###456 I'm a libertarian when it comes to that.
###458 Again, it's a human right.
###462 If it's a measure of relaxation and enjoyment, then
###465 what's the difference between smoking a joint or popping a
###468 Quaalude, you know?
###470 We went out there to support them.
###474 We're always trying to support the little guy, you know?
###477 
###483 THOMAS MORTON: One thing that's marked a lot of the
###485 coverage and, I think, has muddied the waters is trying
###489 to overlay many of these issues with
###492 kind of racial politics.
###495 Mitch--
###495 NORMAN OLSON: Mitch [INAUDIBLE].
###498 He was a Hawaiian.
###499 THOMAS MORTON: Ah.
###500 NORMAN OLSON: Yeah, yeah.
###500 So from the very beginning, we had racial diversity.
###506 THOMAS MORTON: Now you guys have referred to the Black
###508 Panthers and stuff as a militia--
###511 not necessarily exactly the same as you, but in the same
###516 spirit, in its early days.
###517 
###520 NORMAN OLSON: Whether you sit down with the Black Panthers
###523 or you sit down with the Native Americans, I'm sure
###525 that we all want the very same thing.
###528 RAY SOUTHWELL: So it's not the black community that sees us
###531 as racists.
###533 It's the ignorant white community, who are so quickly
###538 misled by the media.
###540 NORMAN OLSON: Who keeps us divided?
###542 Remember we were talking about control and power and central
###544 government?
###545 Of course.
###546 It's to the benefit of a central government to keep us
###548 divided, to set up these little target groups,
###552 marginalizing so that people cannot come together, so that
###556 the power cannot be given back to the people.
###558 As long as we're squabbling among ourselves, we'll never
###560 be able to stand up against tyranny and oppression.
###564 We'll be arguing with ourselves while they march us
###567 into a trench to machine-gun us.
###569 
###572 It just doesn't make any sense.
###576 Then it happened.
###577 
###579 Boy, it all hit the fan.
###581 I'll tell you what.
###584 When Oklahoma City, that event happened,
###588 it surprised everyone.
###590 I had heard rumors along the Missouri border that there was
###592 going to be a bombing against the federal building, either
###595 in Tulsa or in Oklahoma City.
###597 It was common knowledge.
###598 The Feds knew that.
###599 They knew it was going to happen.
###600 They didn't know where.
###602 But when it happened, it surprised
###603 everybody in the militia.
###604 I remember Leslie Stahl was in the gun shop there when it all
###607 happened, and they made the mention of Timothy McVeigh and
###613 the brothers, what are their names?
###614 RAY SOUTHWELL: Nichols.
###615 NORMAN OLSON: Nichols.
###616 Terry Nichols.
###617 And they linked it with the Michigan Militia.
###619 And then it all started to unravel it.
###621 We deactivated after seven years and started to go home.
###625 Some stayed.
###627 Some stayed.
###629 People got frightened then, because the media picked up on
###632 it and ran with the militia connection, to the extent that
###637 the militia, a third of the militia ran and hid.
###640 A third of them went underground.
###641 Didn't want to be seen, didn't want to be on a list, didn't
###644 want to be photographed.
###645 Another third just quit the militia altogether.
###647 They realized this wasn't paintball in the
###649 woods on the weekend.
###650 This was life-and-death stuff.
###652 And another third became more aggressive, more adamant about
###656 standing up against the government, because we saw the
###659 conspiracy against it, against what was happening.
###663 THOMAS MORTON: Do you think there was ever a possibility
###665 that what happened in Oklahoma and as a result of it could
###671 have been fully averted?
###672 Or was it just--
###674 NORMAN OLSON: Actually, I believe it was the CIA.
###676 It sounds crazy.
###677 THOMAS MORTON: Well, the CIA's done a lot of crazy things.
###680 NORMAN OLSON: Well, listen to me.
###681 You know, when you talk about neo-Nazis and skinheads and
###684 white supremacists, which McVeigh was
###687 closely associated with--
###688 who's funding all of that hatred?
###692 And if they could get a stooge like Timothy McVeigh to do
###695 that, and Terry Nichols collaborating?
###699 But what about the unknown?
###700 What about this fellow that went back to Germany?
###703 I don't think it'll ever be known, the extra leg they
###707 found in the rubble with the military boot on it, that they
###710 couldn't match up to anybody.
###712 Where did that come from?
###713 You don't read about that, but it was there.
###715 And so did they know beforehand?
###718 Did somebody go in there and set charges?
###721 I don't know.
###722 But I'm welcome to hear any theory, because that's all I
###727 have, is a theory.
###730 There's something out there, but I guess
###734 Fox Mulder was right.
###735 The truth is out there, somewhere.
###737 
###740 Did the federal government stage the Oklahoma City
###743 bombing to bust up the militia because the militia was
###746 growing too strong?
###749 That could be argued.
###750 And history may reveal it.
###753 I don't know.
###753 We think it did.
###754 We think that they had to stop the militia because we were
###757 growing so fast across the country that we were
###760 threatening to take the power away from the federal
###762 government.
###763 THOMAS MORTON: Did you personally
###764 meet Tim McVeigh before--
###765 NORMAN OLSON: No, not personally.
###766 He was downstate.
###767 I was up north.
###768 I didn't get a chance to meet him.
###770 Of course, the federal government did a fine job of
###772 proving that Timothy McVeigh was working out
###775 of an act of revenge.
###777 So when I went up to Washington to testify before
###780 the Senate and got into that pissing contest with Arlen
###784 Specter, I pointed that out to him.
###787 And he couldn't understand how I could understand what was
###790 going on in Timothy McVeigh's mind.
###792 Well, you don't understand the problem that we've had in
###794 Northern Ireland.
###795 You don't understand the problem that we've had in
###796 South Africa.
###797 You do not understand the hatred and retaliation, the
###800 retribution and the revenge that has been going on around
###802 this globe since time immortal.
###805 Then you don't understand the dynamic, sir.
###807 ARLEN SPECTER: Well, Mr. Olson, I may not understand.
###810 And that's why we've had these hearings, so that you could
###813 have a full opportunity to express yourself.
###815 NORMAN OLSON: I said well, it'd be about as simple as I
###817 slap you, you slap me in retaliation.
###820 OK?
###820 What don't we understand about that?
###823 Of course, we tried to distance
###825 ourself from all of that.
###826 And we threw the meat in on the other side of the river,
###828 claiming the Japanese did it, but what happened was is that
###831 took all of the emphasis away from us and headed it in
###833 another direction.
###834 Kind of dispersed that whole feeling.
###838 And fear is strong.
###841 THOMAS MORTON: About the theory that the Japanese were
###844 retaliating for the sarin gas thing?
###848 NORMAN OLSON: No, we didn't have any strong connection.
###849 We brought that out--
###850 actually, what it did was it defused the
###856 direction we were going.
###857 Because we were going headlong into a big
###859 confrontation with the Feds.
###861 They thought we were all wacky and crazy.
###864 But that actually freed us up to go in a different direction
###867 at that time, which we needed.
###869 And what may be thought of as bad actually worked out good.
###875 Today, they laugh at us and make--
###878 but it's a matter of strategic decisions that we made.
###885 But things changed after Oklahoma City, changed
###887 drastically.
###888 And a lot of people fell away.
###891 And then Bush came onto the scene and everything got to be
###894 nice and the government was seen to be a kind, friendly,
###899 benevolent government, ready to help us.
###902 But that was just a facade.
###904 That was just a cover.
###906 They're not there to help us at all.
###908 They're there to eke out our substance and to rob us of
###911 everything that we have.
###913 And take away our power.
###916 So power to the people, huh?
###917 
###924 Our job in Michigan was pretty well done.
###927 THOMAS MORTON: Why did you leave Michigan?
###929 And why did you pick Alaska?
###931 NORMAN OLSON: I often ask people that question.
###933 Why did you come to Alaska?
###935 I'm always interested where they come from
###937 and the reason why.
###939 And many people don't really know.
###942 Something just drew them.
###944 I know that sounds ethereal and all of that,
###946 but here's the thing.
###948 Alaska is a place, it's a new frontier.
###953 I think socially, economically, culturally there
###957 is much that appeals to us.
###960 We were in Michigan.
###961 Michigan, anybody who wants to look at the statistics knows
###964 that Michigan is going bottom-up economically.
###968 There was nothing there for us, no reason to stay.
###973 And people had pretty well lost their desire to stand up.
###977 I think the spirit of resistance, the spirit of
###981 standing up against the encroaching IRS and federal
###984 government intrusion into people's lives had pretty well
###988 wasted away their spirit.
###991 And so they feel like leaving.
###995 We were on the tail-end of that, and seeing it all come
###999 about, some of us came up here for new adventures, new
###1002 opportunities.
###1003 Others came up here to leave something behind.
###1009 RAY SOUTHWELL: And it's the last adventure state left in
###1013 the union, as far as I'm concerned.
###1015 So I think that was probably the big emphasis on
###1019 why we moved up.
###1021 NORMAN OLSON: This one was just from a couple weeks ago,
###1023 September 16.
###1025 We are free from individual income tax here.
###1029 Much of the state is free from sales tax.
###1032 So there are many, many benefits.
###1035 THOMAS MORTON: It seems very personal-liberty-oriented, and
###1037 yet there's some odd spots about it.
###1039 I think the lack of sheriffs in the entire state--
###1044 how do you feel about Alaskan state politics, in that sense?
###1049 RAY SOUTHWELL: We had an excellent working relationship
###1052 in Michigan with our sheriff.
###1054 I met with him on usually a monthly basis to let him know
###1058 when we were doing training, where we were training.
###1061 And officially, he could never support us, you know, the
###1065 politics involved with it.
###1067 But he publicly came out and told the community through the
###1071 media that we were doing nothing wrong.
###1074 So the sheriff, as an elected servant of the people, truly
###1081 understands how to build that relationship with the people.
###1085 So we trusted him.
###1087 NORMAN OLSON: You see, people say, well, we can trust the
###1088 Alaskan government.
###1089 Well, I don't know how far Alaska has sold out to the
###1094 federals for whatever payment is due for all that the
###1099 federal government has poured into Alaska.
###1102 There's too many strings attached to a lot of the
###1105 bailouts and all the rest of it.
###1107 So I'm always concerned about what liberties and what rights
###1112 are at risk when we give the promise of safety into the
###1118 hands of governmental authorities.
###1121 I like to keep this liberty and this freedom at the lowest
###1124 level possible--
###1124 among the citizens themselves.
###1127 RAY SOUTHWELL: I think the other part of this area, and
###1131 probably throughout Alaska, is our independence.
###1135 And I was talking to one of the local gun dealers.
###1138 The peninsula has 50,000 people.
###1141 And this particular one gun dealer is selling 1,000
###1144 military arms a month.
###1147 So in the last month, or last year, he has sold 12,000
###1151 firearms to 50,000 people.
###1153 So you can start seeing those numbers.
###1156 But what's happening--
###1157 NORMAN OLSON: They're upgrading.
###1158 RAY SOUTHWELL: There's two mindsets, I think, that are
###1160 out there, is Alaskans' independence.
###1163 I can take care of myself and my family.
###1165 I will arm myself and I will prepare for whatever may come,
###1169 and I'll be ready.
###1170 The other mindset is I am doing that same issue, but I
###1175 don't want anybody to know it.
###1176 It's a secret, because the feds might come and take my
###1179 guns, or just a tremendous amount of independence, but
###1183 there's also a tremendous amount of fear.
###1186 What my fear is is that if and when there's an economic
###1193 disintegration, there's going to be anarchy
###1195 all over the country.
###1198 THOMAS MORTON: Given the rate at which things are going,
###1200 does it concern you that militia may not be ready?
###1203 RAY SOUTHWELL: Yes.
###1204 NORMAN OLSON: Oh, yes.
###1205 RAY SOUTHWELL: Yeah.
###1205 Yes.
###1206 NORMAN OLSON: Too little, too late.
###1207 RAY SOUTHWELL: Yes.
###1209 I foresee more anarchy.
###1211 NORMAN OLSON: We're very vulnerable.
###1212 RAY SOUTHWELL: Neighbor fighting neighbor for goods.
###1218 NORMAN OLSON: There's only two extremes--
###1219 anarchy and tyranny.
###1221 I'm concerned that we are not networked.
###1223 We are not prepared.
###1224 We are very vulnerable here in Alaska.
###1227 One road in, one road out.
###1229 The wise people will prepare for what may be coming, and
###1233 what we believe will come with economic collapse, with social
###1237 disruption, with more government intrusion.
###1241 So all we are doing is being prudent, long-viewed people
###1246 who are able to read the times, prepare for the worst.
###1251 It's as simple as that.
###1254 And we still have some pages to fill.
###1257 Isn't that optimistic?
###1260 If nothing else, you know, they say at the end of your
###1262 life, everything that you own is either going to be put out
###1265 by the side of the road, auctioned off,
###1266 or end up in a landfill.
###1268 The only thing you can leave your children is a legacy of
###1270 who you were, what you tried to do.
###1272 If it's a life well spent doing what you think is right,
###1275 then can't argue with that.
###1279 Just try and help the little guy, you know?
###1281 Help the little guy survive.
###1283 There's a lot of folks out there that are being chewed up
###1286 by the system and need help.
###1288 So we just keep on helping, you know?
###1291 Call us crazy, call us fanatics, call us loons, but
###1295 don't call us shortsighted.
###1298 Trying to look far enough ahead to
###1299 prepare for what's coming.
