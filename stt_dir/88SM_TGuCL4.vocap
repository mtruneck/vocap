###2 I reject that. I reject the idea of modern neurogolist that might feel that depression
###10 is genetically inherited...or just a re..product of genetic damage. The reason I don't believe
###20 that is I worked with so many people, alocholics, drug addicts..people with a prison record
###26 and I took that out in one session. So if it was genetic it wouldn't come out. That's
###32 how I know it works..and I don't know if you saved the letters. Do you? That we get from
###38 people that said, "I was about to turn my life in. I have no reason. You gave me a reason
###45 to live and work." So..that's all I can go by not genetics. I can't do anything with
###52 genetics. If a doctor says, "Someday we'll have a cure for Cancer." That may encourage
###60 a person..but it won't encourage me inless I say, "What is your approach?" and they give
###66 me an approach..that would encourage me.. if I had cancer. Do you understand? If the
###72 guy says, "I'm sure you'll get well. Have faith in yourself." Cancer don't give a shit
###78 about that. It just keeps multiplying. You might live a week longer or three weeks longer
###87 if you have..self-confidence..but always ask a person...like..nobody asks any of these..T..Tea
###95 group people, "What would you do under these circumstances? How would you solve this problem?
###102 How would you get the Democrats to see the Republican point of view?" THEY NEVER TALK
###107 ABOUT THAT. They talk about their own limitations. I would say, therefore, most Capitalist, that
###115 drive that system are very simple people with a low self-image. Now I did mention in the
###122 past that psychologist have a higher suicide rate than normal. That means they undergo
###129 depression..and if they really ask the question, "WHAT IS DEPRESSION?" say, "I don't know"
###134 Then a guy writes a theory of genetics..of the genes. That doesn't take away the depression.
###142 Do you understand that? Taking drugs might tranquilize you..or drinking alcohol when
###150 you're depressed might take you out of your self-image. You just sit there and look around.
###155 It makes you feel relaxed and comfortable. Next day there's a hangover and the depression......if
###163 you don't deal with it. Now, you can't deal with it if you don't even know how to go about
###169 looking into it. So let me show you how you go about looking into, "What is a Depression?".
###176 You read the books on genetics and you understand that pills can make a person feel more in
###182 equilibrium. Is the chemistry of the body in equilibrium? If you're depressed, yes.
###190 Your digestive system stops..alot of other things manifest themselves,....but if you
###196 feel positive about what you're doing. If you're sawing a tree down and uh "I HATE to
###202 do this!" Well you poison yourself. Do you understand what I mean? Anything you do that
###209 you don't like..but if you say, "I have to repair that model or clean it and that's going
###215 to take about two and a half hours." It depends on your predictability. If it takes 5 hours,
###221 you might be disappointed. Not in the vision!. Not in the uh thing...in your estimation!
###228 Do you understand? It's your own estimation. If you figure it should take you three days
###233 to do a given job. If it takes twenty-three days, you may get disappointed. Say, "I don't
###239 know how long it'll take but I'm gonna check it out." and you do a certain amount of work
###246 and you predict the next and if it comes close, you can use that method of predictability.
###252 Is there anything..did you get this message? This is how you deal with depressed people...and
###258 that's what depression is...unless you have further questions....Put it out there let's
###265 see how it works. If you get a response saying, "You know that really helped alot.." Psychiatrist
###276 don't even know what the question is. They think some people are depressed and others
###281 aren't...and some are 'happy go lucky' no matter what. They have a self-image even though
###288 it's false. If you feel/..if you're a minister and you administer to people's problems and
###295 they feel good about it, you feel you're doing something useful. There are ministers that
###300 feel that they're administering to human need..and as long as that person says, "God Bless you.
###307 Thank you. You've helped me alot." Whatever the minister did helped them..but if the minister
###313 was an operational linguist and he helped them to understand what they're are going
###320 through and why people get depressed, I think that's better than comforting them and saying,
###324 "You'll pull out of it, I have every/..confidence that you will." Well, if your minister says
###330 that, there may be a basis for it... but it's not real. Knowing the difference is a problem.
###340 "Just/.." Well the Tea Party is a group of people that believe in the structure of this
###347 economic system. Why? Because they're successful in it. A military man that's awarded a higher
###356 position, if he gets to be captin or lieutanant colonel, he gets reward for it...so he feels
###364 very proud. The more merit badget he has, the greater he feels. If the Nazi has more
###370 merit badges, the Jew don't feel too good about that but the Nazi feels great about
###376 it. Do you understand? So, "What is a reinforcer?" Whatever the hell reinforces people. Except
###385 alcohol. That's a dependency that makes you feel like you don't/...you lose your identity
###392 under alcohol. Say, "Did I say that when I was drunk?" cuz you don't even know what you
###396 said. That means you don't have your own identity. Identity means, "Fresco likes to walk in the
###407 Sun. He likes to make things. He likes to talk to people about their problems..but he
###415 feels that/..." If i share the tools I have and say, "Keep coming to me." and uh, and
###422 I never give them my tools, I do not help them..really. Unless I have them the tools
###430 that I have. The same tools that enables me to solve a problem..okay... but I'd rather
###438 not give these tools out because I'm afraid of the culture. They'll commercialize on it,
###446 use it, and../ but they won't change the way people think about things. Not only depression,
###452 I try to change the way people think about most/.. everything. Now if you don't understand
###463 what I'm saying...you might even HATE what I'm saying. I'll say, "That doesn't answer
###470 the question." Roxanne: "I remember in your old lectures you use to tell people to write
###473 a list when you're not/..when you're feeling better, when you're not depressed. Write a
###476 list of all the things you like to do....all the things you don't like to do and then when
###482 you're depressed, look at the list and just do those things that you like to do." Yeah,
###486 when you're depressed, you don't feel like doing it. Roxanne: "But you used to use that
###491 as a tool. Didn't you?" Yeeeah. Well..I..it worked at the time. All I can say is that
###497 I'm giving you the focal point of a depression. LOSS OF SELF-IMAGE. "Who am I? Where am I
###502 going? What is my life about? I don't know. I don't even know..if i'd be successful at
###509 anything." That's no self-image. You're always successful at something. You can always teach
###514 somebody something. You're not totally a total failure. If a person comes to me and says
###522 I'm depressed, that's better..if they come here. Well I give them a social awareness
###528 that futbol is really a little spot in entertainment but when you inform people, it changes alot
###536 of things. See, futbol just makes the game pleasant but if you lose, you're depressed..
###542 and they get into fights alot. I don't know if you know that...all over the world. So,
###552 it isn't a good thing. No competitive sport is. When a guy hits a golf ball..ball and
###552 it misses, he throws the stick down on the ground. The puck? Is that what you call it?
###555 He throws it on the ground and he feels bad..and when the audience applauds when he hits it
###565 and it goes into the hole they applaud. Makes him feel good..he has a self-image.. but if
###570 he hits it and it and it doesn't go into the hole..the audience just looks on, and they
###576 don't reinforce him. So, if I designed a MAGNETIC SYSTEM in the hole, and a STEEL BALL in the
###584 golf..even if he missed it...it would be going into the hole. You know? What do you want?
###589 It's such a ridiculous game...of hitting a golf ball and looking for it. What? It's a
###595 ridiculous game...or racing cars around in a circle. If you get your kicks out of that,
###601 it's because you have a low self-image..and you love it when the audience says, "You won
###605 that race. You did a beautiful job!" You know..that is a, uh, a moment in time..but the things
###617 we are working on are...are everything. The games of the future. Things of that sort.
###626 Now a game of the future.. typical game of the future is not made by people who make
###632 games. They would be like this: There'd be a map and then.. you would find out which
###638 state has the most cancer and you put these little beads there and the other states that
###644 has the least amount of cancer... and you know when you're through playing the game,
###648 you'd know what the hell exist in America. You'd know the states with the highest divorce
###654 rate, the highest crime rate, where there's more poverty. If you find out that poverty
###662 encourages abhorrent behavior then if you don't want to do anything about it, you don't
###672 understand that problem. If you give a working man a little above the standard of living
###676 so he can buy a television set, a radio, a cell phone. If you just give him enough to
###684 live on, you don't build a study person, a loyal person. If a person has a little more
###690 than they need, they'll come back to work. If you give them more than they need, they
###695 won't show up. So the money system kills incentive to go to work. So people say, "Fuck it. I'm
###703 not going in/. I'm going to call in sick." Did you ever hear of that? So they call in
###709 sick... but that isn't the answer. "You should be obedient to your corporation." That..that's
###714 a control device. You know. "I love my company." If you love your company, that's no self-image
###726 at all. The union has a self-image. They'd like to see the company succeed but they'd
###733 like a piece of the action. So instead of making $18 a week, they go on strike and they
###739 get $25 a week... but the company loses the competitive edge... because they have to raise
###746 the price of their product. So they HATE unions because it lowers their standard of living.
###753 The unions love unions, the members, it raises their standard of living. Everybody is right...
###760 that's the trouble with the world but nobody knows what to do. Nobody wants to give up
###766 their position of advantage. I don't know how much of this your'e going to stick out
###772 there but... okay. Take it from here.
