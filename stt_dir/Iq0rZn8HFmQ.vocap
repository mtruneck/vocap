###1 I'm the publisher of Vice Magazine.

###12 We had heard about this guy named Heimo Korth.
###14 He lives in an area called the Alaska National Wildlife
###17 Refuge, ANWR for short.
###19 Heimo's one of the most impressive
###21 people I've ever met.
###22 He is almost totally self-sufficient, and he's one
###26 of those guys that could survive no matter what.
###29 Now here it is.
###30 Vice presents Heimo's Arctic Refuge.

###67 At five, visibility one and one-quarter.
###71 Ceiling 400 overcast.
###73 Temperature zero.
###75 HEIMO KORTH: Me and Edna are the last ones left to actually
###77 live out here.
###79 The rest live in Fairbanks, and they just commute from
###81 Fairbanks out here, spend a month or two, and
###83 then they go back.
###86 And this is the only National Wildlife Refuge that has polar
###89 bears and moose and caribou.
###92 It's got a lot of media attention because they want to
###95 drill for oil here.
###97 The vast majority of America's against it.
###99 Eventually, they just want to get people
###101 out of the land here.
###101 That's why this permit for us to be here is only good up
###104 until the death of our last child.
###107 And then after that, that's it.
###108 
###139 THOMAS MORTON: Hey, it's Thomas.
###141 We are in the Brooks Mountains.
###144 It's in Alaska, a few hundred miles north of Fairbanks and
###147 basically the rest of civilization.
###149 
###152 We're going to the cabin of Heimo Korth and his wife Edna.
###155 He's been a trapper up here for 30 years,
###158 carved out his own life.
###159 Lives completely by his wits with a little assistance from
###163 the occasional bush plane.
###164 
###169 Heimo Korth moved to Alaska when he was 19 to get as far
###172 away as possible from human civilization.
###175 He met his wife Edna while living in an Eskimo whaling
###178 village on St. Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea.
###181 Eventually he convinced her to move with him to the harsh
###183 Alaskan interior, more than 150 miles above the Arctic
###186 Circle and even farther from the nearest roads,
###189 supermarket, or schools.
###191 Two of last people allowed to live in an area the size of
###194 South Carolina.
###195 
###197 Their nearest neighbor is about 100 miles away, and the
###200 only chance of emergency medical care is by calling the
###202 Army for a helicopter ride.
###205 They've managed to raise a family out here while dealing
###207 with the fearsome climate, isolation, predators, and the
###211 drowning death of their firstborn daughter.
###213 The Korths migrate annually between three separate cabins.
###217 Rotating cabins keeps them from depleting the resources
###219 in any one spot and ensures that there should always be
###222 enough fur and meat available for them to make
###224 it through a winter.
###226 We're going to spend a week with them and see what it's
###228 like to live on America's last frontier.
###231 KEN MICHAELS: Just look for a straight gravel bar,
###234 straight's the key thing.
###235 Hopefully into the wind.
###237 Oh, there's his cabin.
###239 THOMAS MORTON: Oh, yeah.
###240 KEN MICHAELS: Oh, there's his tent.
###241 
###245 Landing should be still all right at this time.
###247 
###269 HEIMO KORTH: My name's Heimo Korth and this is where we
###272 live in the northeastern part of Alaska.
###274 It's beautiful.
###275 Three degrees this morning.
###277 EDNA KORTH: My name is Edna Korth and I'm glad
###280 you guys are here.
###282 
###288 THOMAS MORTON: Already breaking in the gear.
###289 
###294 This is our lifeline.
###296 It's about to head back to Fairbanks.
###298 
###312 HEIMO KORTH: Me, and there are six others in the refuge that
###315 were here prior to it being a refuge.
###317 
###320 It's very commonly known as ANWR, you know, it's like
###323 abbreviated for Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
###325 So once it became a refuge, I guess we were
###328 grandfathered in.
###330 
###340 [DOG BARKING]
###346 THOMAS MORTON: God, bear alarm.
###349 Oh, look at all that meat.
###352 HEIMO KORTH: People come out and they want to do this, and
###354 they don't realize how it is.
###356 They think, oh, I can do it.
###357 I can do it.
###358 And then they come out, and pretty soon they realize,
###360 damn, it ain't like this.
###362 And they build a nice place and they spend two or three
###364 years, just to tough it out, just to prove to themselves.
###367 I mean, for someone to trap this far out like this?
###369 It took me years and years and years to get
###371 what we have here.
###373 Now we come over here.
###374 The reason we set up this tent is because if the cabin ever
###377 burns down, the tent is here.
###379 It has a wood stove, it has wood in there, it has cots in
###382 there, it has extra clothes, extra sleeping bag--
###384 that would actually save your life.
###386 It's very important.
###388 To be out this far without something extra to get into,
###393 you're running a high risk.
###396 Put the branches in like that.
###400 Here's the stock market, which really affects you out here.
###404 OK. do you think you can get it going?
###407 THOMAS MORTON: I think so.
###408 HEIMO KORTH: OK.
###409 You'll learn really quick.
###410 OK, close it up.
###412 Our youngest daughter and her husband were sleeping in here
###415 when they came up here last month.
###417 Our other daughter, her child, we had the grandkid up here.
###420 THOMAS MORTON: That's great.
###422 EDNA KORTH: When we built the house when the girls were
###425 small, we put moss and logs.
###428 THOMAS MORTON: Is there anything else between them?
###430 EDNA KORTH: No.
###431 Just moss.
###431 THOMAS MORTON: Just moss and log?
###432 Wow.
###434 EDNA KORTH: Rhonda, she's 24 and she's working at the
###438 emergency room.
###439 Krin, she's married and she's 20.
###443 And she works at Sportsman's Warehouse.
###446 She wants to go back to college.
###449 A week before you guys were here, they were
###451 both here for 10 days.
###453 It was nice to have them out here, but kind of crowded.
###458 THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.
###459 
###465 HEIMO KORTH: These are some of the caribou that we shoot.
###467 These are the heads from the caribou.
###468 And we eat the heads.
###469 When we're going to eat them, we just saw off the horns and
###471 skin the head, and then we take the eyeballs out and then
###474 we roast the rest of it.
###476 We eat the tongue, the cheeks, the lip, brain, everything.
###478 THOMAS MORTON: It's good eating.
###479 HEIMO KORTH: It is.
###480 It's very good eating.
###481 THOMAS MORTON: What's in the bag?
###483 HEIMO KORTH: Oh, a bear skin.
###483 THOMAS MORTON: Oh.
###484 HEIMO KORTH: A bear skin.
###485 This bear came into the yard to get the meat.
###487 THOMAS MORTON: How long ago?
###489 HEIMO KORTH: A week ago.
###489 A week ago.
###491 I was just--
###492 I just walked over here, and all of a sudden, I look up and
###495 there's a bear standing in front of me.
###497 Edna, I need my shotgun.
###500 And so with this much meat around, he'll just keep coming
###504 back, coming back.
###505 It's not good.
###506 So you gotta do something about it.
###508 This is caribou meat, the hind leg.
###511 A good healthy sign that--
###512 if you kill an animal and it's fat, the animal's healthy.
###516 If it's skin and bones, there's
###517 something wrong with it.
###518 And this here's part of a moose neck here.
###521 Here's a side of ribs.
###522 THOMAS MORTON: God, it's huge.
###524 HEIMO KORTH: Yeah.
###525 THOMAS MORTON: These fish are all king salmon.
###527 And these are the ones in the summertime I catch, and then
###529 we save these and use these for trapping bait.
###532 These are used primarily for martin, mink, lynx, wolf,
###536 wolverine, fox, weasel.
###538 [DOG BARKS]
###539 HEIMO KORTH: Kenai, huh?
###540 She's half husky and half Akita.
###543 To alert us when there's bear and stuff.
###545 So the dog stays outside, because I don't believe in a
###548 dog coming in the house.
###549 I'm really against that.
###550 These drums are used for storing food.
###553 Craisins, pancake mix.
###556 And this way, a bear can't get into it.
###557 We have an extra satellite phone, and it goes in there.
###560 And that is in case the cabin burns down.
###563 THOMAS MORTON: How long have you had this cabin?
###564 HEIMO KORTH: Oh, we built this one in 1984.
###567 And this pole here, this is a tree that
###569 was here and it died.
###570 But I attached the satellite phone antenna to it.
###575 And then this other antenna, right straight up, that's for
###577 the aircraft radio so I can talk to airplanes.
###579 THOMAS MORTON: And the salad dressing and the guns?
###581 HEIMO KORTH: You know, the shotgun in
###583 case there's a bear.
###584 There's a rifle here for the caribou, and
###585 this .22 for grouse.
###587 And the salad dressing and all, keep it cool out there.
###590 Damn, let me get my coat.
###591 I'm freezing.
###592 You guys ain't cold?
###594 THOMAS MORTON: I'm getting there.
###595 HEIMO KORTH: I'm getting there now.
###596 I gotta get my coat.
###597 Hello, Edna.
###599 Oh, this is the antenna for the radio, right here.
###602 In the middle of winter, jeez, we pick up Europe easy.
###604 London comes in real easy.
###606 Tokyo, all that.
###608 [MIMICS ASIAN LANGUAGE]
###609 You know, China somewhere, I don't know.
###612 They all come in.
###613 THOMAS MORTON: Are these all your traps?
###614 HEIMO KORTH: All?
###616 There's maybe 1/100th of them right here.
###619 THOMAS MORTON: Where are the rest?
###620 HEIMO KORTH: All over.
###621 THOMAS MORTON: Oh, oh, they're already out and set.
###623 HEIMO KORTH: Yeah, a lot of them.
###624 This is for marten and mink and muskrat.
###627 And this is a beaver snare here.
###628 We put this under the ice for beaver.
###632 And then here's more snares right here.
###635 THOMAS MORTON: John and John, they're getting a shotgun.
###637 But I'm gonna say, if the dogs go nuts, more likely or not
###642 it's a moose or a caribou, but it could be a bear.
###644 How you guys doing?
###646 JOHN MCSHANE: Doing all right.
###647 THOMAS MORTON: Basically, they're like our bear alarm.
###649 
###656 [SAWING]
###662 THOMAS MORTON: I'm still wondering, when did you decide
###664 to go to Alaska?
###666 HEIMO KORTH: I was just looking through those Outdoor
###668 Life magazines.
###668 You know what them are?
###669 Them hunting magazines?
###670 This is 1974, though, mind you.
###673 You know what I mean?
###674 You know, I'll write to hunting guides and see if they
###677 could use somebody.
###679 And he wrote back, and he said, yeah, he uses
###681 packers to pack meat.
###683 I was young, 19 then, and I said, yeah, I'll go for it.
###687 So I did.
###688 
###690 THOMAS MORTON: How did you get interested
###691 in the Arctic, though?
###692 Do you remember?
###693 HEIMO KORTH: Oh, just wanted to go someplace where there
###695 wasn't any people.
###698 And so the Arctic is one of the few places
###700 that there's no people.
###701 THOMAS MORTON: Where did you pick up all
###703 your trapping knowledge?
###704 Did you have to learn that when you got to
###706 Alaska, or did you--
###707 HEIMO KORTH: Down in Wisconsin, when I grew up.
###711 A lot of it was trial and error.
###713 THOMAS MORTON: Up here?
###714 HEIMO KORTH: Oh, yeah.
###715 Big time.
###715 THOMAS MORTON: Yeah?
###715 I just think it's weird, that you like--
###717 you're so social.
###718 HEIMO KORTH: That why would I live out here?
###719 THOMAS MORTON: Yeah, I really expected you to be-- through
###721 your teeth, you were gonna say, you
###722 know, one-word answers.
###723 HEIMO KORTH: Oh, yeah, get out of here.
###725 Don't ask stupid questions.
###726 THOMAS MORTON: Doing it wrong.
###727 HEIMO KORTH: You know, just 'cause you live out here
###729 doesn't mean you have to be like that.
###731 THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.
###731 HEIMO KORTH: The stomach needs food and
###733 the mind needs people.
###734 THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.
###735 HEIMO KORTH: I mean, people need other people.
###737 You just can't say, I'm going to be alone, you know?
###739 That's not normal.
###740 THOMAS MORTON: In your first couple years, weren't you
###742 going it alone, though?
###744 HEIMO KORTH: Oh, I was alone.
###744 I was only here from August until the first of March.
###747 First of August to the first of March.
###749 THOMAS MORTON: That's still a very long time.
###749 HEIMO KORTH: I know it is.
###750 Oh, yeah.
###751 Tell me about it.
###751 When you're alone, that's a real long time.
###753 I would never do that again.
###756 There's no way.
###757 I mean, that's not normal.
###758 You know, I'm glad I got kids and daughters.
###763 And you know, just have family.
###766 That's important.
###766 It's very important.
###767 Let's say if something happened to Edna, that I was a
###770 widower, I--
###772 I--
###773 no.
###774 I wouldn't do it alone.
###776 This one's done.
###777 THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.
###778 All right, thank you.
###781 HEIMO KORTH: What?
###783 THOMAS MORTON: Was it my feet?
###784 EDNA KORTH: No, it's his.
###785 HEIMO KORTH: What happened?
###786 I didn't step on the carpet.
###788 
###794 HEIMO KORTH: Well, of course it's black.
###794 I'm stepping in the mud right now.
###796 
###800 No matter what, it's my fault.
###802 So I'll just leave it at that.
###806 THOMAS MORTON: Do you ever think about how long you can--
###809 HEIMO KORTH: Live out here?
###810 THOMAS MORTON: Yeah, you can keep this lifestyle?
###811 HEIMO KORTH: Well, I hope to die out here.
###813 How does that sound?
###815 I just do it not because I want to be a survivalist.
###818 It's just because it's a way of life.
###821 
###826 Ooh.
###828 Aah.
###829 Burned my lip.
###830 
###837 THOMAS MORTON: There you go.
###838 MALE SPEAKER: You ready?
###838 THOMAS MORTON: Shall we?
###840 
###851 THOMAS MORTON (WHISPERING): It's gone now.
###852 HEIMO KORTH (WHISPERING): Yeah, it's gone now.
###854 But I'm just listening for something
###857 swimming across the water.
###859 That's-- you see across the river, right
###862 where my light is shining?
###863 I shot--
###865 I shot the caribou over there.
###867 And the good pile is over there, you see?
###870 And when I came out here just now, I looked over there and I
###873 saw a pair of eyes looking at us.
###876 I don't know what it was.
###878 Right there it is.
###879 See it over there?
###880 See it?
###881 See the eyes over there?
###883 
###886 OK, nobody talk.
###887 Let's all go over there and get water.
###889 And if that starts swimming across the river, then--
###896 tell me.
###897 THOMAS MORTON (WHISPERING): OK.
###898 
###910 HEIMO KORTH (WHISPERING): Kinda eerie feeling, ain't it?
###912 You know, you look over there and see two white
###914 eyes looking at us.
###917 THOMAS MORTON: We had a good summer camp vibe going by the
###919 end of night one, but the monster eyes across the river
###921 served as a good reminder that we had a lot more to fear out
###924 here than constricted bowels and shitty cocoa.
###926 HEIMO KORTH: Who saw the eyes, besides me?
###929 THOMAS MORTON: I think I saw them.
###930 I saw something.
###931 MALE SPEAKER: John?
###932 HEIMO KORTH: Here's the gun.
###933 You might as well take it, anyways.
###936 THOMAS MORTON: Being told to sleep with a loaded shotgun
###938 also didn't help.
###939 
###949 It's another day in the Arctic.
###953 We got about two inches of snow last night.
###955 This morning I woke up to a gunshot.
###957 [GUNSHOT]
###959 THOMAS MORTON: That was evidently
###960 Heimo popping a squirrel.
###962 I just want to check on the temperature before we go in.
###965 It's 20 degrees.
###966 I think it's good to point out how far down these
###968 thermometers go, and that is to negative 80.
###970 But that shit hopefully happens months
###973 from now, not tomorrow.
###974 
###977 EDNA KORTH: There's a chair over there.
###979 HEIMO KORTH: Oatmeal?
###980 How's oatmeal today?
###981 THOMAS MORTON: Oatmeal's great.
###984 [GUNSHOT]
###985 HEIMO KORTH: There you go.
###986 The .22 for grouse and that.
###988 THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.
###988 HEIMO KORTH: You know, so we can have--
###989 THOMAS MORTON: Shoot some dinner.
###989 HEIMO KORTH: Yeah, there you go.
###990 There you go.
###991 Right on.
###994 EDNA KORTH: We do this every year.
###996 This time of the year, we go fishing, Arctic grayling, so
###1001 we could eat them at the wintertime.
###1003 I went fishing a lot with my dad.
###1006 I'd hunt and trap with him because I was the oldest.
###1010 JOHN MARTIN: Where did you grow up?
###1011 EDNA KORTH: Savoonga, St. Lawrence Island.
###1013 
###1016 THOMAS MORTON: I mean, you're following the same route you
###1019 normally take?
###1021 HEIMO KORTH: After living out here for 35 years, you just--
###1024 you just know.
###1025 It's just in you.
###1026 A person just has a sense in him.
###1029 You just know where you're going.
###1031 Look at this.
###1032 See these big slivers like that, and this, and that?
###1035 This was cut down with a stone ax, prior to the white man
###1039 coming here.
###1039 Because there's still stuff out here like that.
###1043 THOMAS MORTON: When'd you first come to the bush?
###1045 EDNA KORTH: In 1982 we got to the lower cabin.
###1050 Heimo has a little tiny cabin that you could
###1053 walk around like this.
###1054 I thought to myself, what am I getting into?
###1059 And then, two days later, I told him, we gotta do
###1064 something about the roof because I'm walking around.
###1068 You hold the line, flip it back, and then as you cast,
###1071 you leave go of the line.
###1074 THOMAS MORTON: Oh, did I--
###1074 shoot.
###1075 EDNA KORTH: What?
###1076 THOMAS MORTON: I think I put it in the tree.
###1079 [SIGH]
###1087 Yeah.
###1087 I've been having a real hard time.
###1090 And then you got to remember it's this again, and again,
###1093 and again, and again, times 50 to 100.
###1096 Which is huge.
###1098 It's mind-boggling.
###1099 
###1104 HEIMO KORTH: Little smaller than an Arctic grayling.
###1106 Ooh, jeez.
###1107 There you go.
###1108 Let me get a stick and--
###1110 
###1112 Look how pretty they are.
###1114 See the spots on them like that?
###1115 Yellow underneath there like that?
###1117 THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.
###1118 Fuck, yeah.
###1120 There we go.
###1121 Yeah.
###1121 EDNA KORTH: All right, you caught one.
###1123 Yay.
###1124 HEIMO KORTH: That's a nice one.
###1125 That's a good-sized one, yeah.
###1126 Shake it hard.
###1128 THOMAS MORTON: Oh, and it just comes right out.
###1129 HEIMO KORTH: Yeah.
###1130 THOMAS MORTON: OK.
###1132 HEIMO KORTH: Just hold him like-- no, you're going to
###1134 hold him, in case you miss.
###1135 I don't want get my fingers smushed.
###1138 Don't hit your fingers, but hit him hard.
###1140 Hard.
###1141 Hard, hard, hard.
###1142 THOMAS MORTON: Oh, I feel bad.
###1143 I feel like I've-- wait, that did it, right?
###1145 HEIMO KORTH: Yeah.
###1145 THOMAS MORTON: OK.
###1146 HEIMO KORTH: There, see, we've got a stringer of fish.
###1148 Supper tonight.
###1150 
###1152 Fry him up with rice and salad?
###1155 How does that sound?
###1155 THOMAS MORTON: Sounds very good right now.
###1157 
###1168 EDNA KORTH: Well, dig in, you boys.
###1169 
###1175 HEIMO KORTH: Good fish?
###1176 THOMAS MORTON: Oh, it's great.
###1177 Hats off.
###1178 
###1192 HEIMO KORTH: We're going to go hunt caribou.
###1194 We're gonna go climb up to a ridge and we're going to look
###1197 for caribou.
###1197 And hopefully there'll be caribou.
###1199 And if there are, then we're shoot a young bull
###1201 or else a lone cow.
###1204 Then we'll have some fresh meat.
###1205 
###1214 THOMAS MORTON: Oh, OK.
###1215 We're gonna-- this is where we're gonna hunt from?
###1216 HEIMO KORTH: Yeah, this is a little rock
###1218 outcropping right here.
###1219 We've got a good view.
###1220 You see all the trails down there?
###1221 THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.
###1222 HEIMO KORTH: You just keep an eye on the trail, see if
###1223 anything follows them.
###1224 If they do, then we go after them, and that's it.
###1227 Then we'll be at it.
###1228 
###1242 This is the my theory about mankind.
###1244 THOMAS MORTON: Mmhm.
###1246 HEIMO KORTH: Mankind was much better off a nomadic hunter.
###1250 Once he starts farming,
###1252 civilization, it didn't improve.
###1254 It went downhill from there.
###1257 I mean, when you look at human beings, how long they've been
###1260 on Earth, there were far more hunters and gatherers than
###1263 what they were farmers.
###1265 
###1269 We're out to set some snowshoe hare snares.
###1272 Tomorrow we're going to check them and hopefully
###1274 we'll have a meal.
###1276 They used the Earth's resources too much.
###1279 It drained--
###1280 I mean, crime increased, diseases increased.
###1283 Life was too easy.
###1284 
###1289 THOMAS MORTON: This is the snare.
###1290 HEIMO KORTH: Yeah.
###1291 I kind of blame, like, Europe.
###1293 I mean, because everybody in Europe was a nomadic hunter.
###1295 Except I blame the Romans for coming there and trying to
###1299 make people into farmers, just like them.
###1302 There's his tracks underneath the snare.
###1304 You want the snare right there.
###1308 Like in France, the Gauls, they did that.
###1310 And then in Britain, to him, they conquered them.
###1313 And they were all just little tribes living off the land,
###1317 like hunting.
###1319 Food was semi-reliable, so then you bred
###1321 more, had more children.
###1322 So then the more children, the more mouths to feed.
###1326 People lived closer together, so in turn, disease came.
###1332 See, I'd like it if you guys catch some, too.
###1335 Because then when we eat it, you'll feel better.
###1337 It's a good feeling.
###1337 It's better than going to the store and buying some.
###1340 That doesn't give you the same feeling, you know, if you go
###1342 out and hunt it or something.
###1344 And now, and now what happened to the Roman civilization?
###1349 THOMAS MORTON: They all got lead poisoning.
###1351 HEIMO KORTH: Yeah, that's right, they did.
###1353 
###1357 I mean, there is only X amount of resources on this Earth,
###1359 and we're using them up at an unbelievable rate.
###1363 THOMAS MORTON: What about drilling?
###1366 HEIMO KORTH: Oh, I'm not--
###1366 THOMAS MORTON: You aren't really for that, right?
###1366 HEIMO KORTH: No, not really.
###1368 No, I'm not for that.
###1369 THOMAS MORTON: If there was as much oil in there as there is
###1370 in Saudi Arabia, would you, would you
###1372 think it was OK for--?
###1374 HEIMO KORTH: If, yeah, but it isn't like that.
###1376 So it's not even close to that.
###1378 It ain't there.
###1379 It just ain't there.
###1382 So I mean, what are we gonna do in another 5,000 years, if
###1384 we're here?
###1386 How much oil is there, if they're going to be using oil?
###1391 And then how many more people can this Earth feed?
###1394 That's another issue.
###1395 
###1398 State opened the beaver season early now, because there's so
###1401 many beaver and hardly anybody's trapping them.
###1403 So we're going to go trap us some beaver.
###1406 
###1409 I mean, things got really, really bad in the world over.
###1413 Not just in one country, but the world over.
###1416 It's the suburbanites and the urbanites
###1419 that's going to suffer.
###1420 The rural people, they're going to have the food.
###1423 And they're going to know how to get the food.
###1426 Not just planting, but hunting.
###1427 
###1431 THOMAS MORTON: What's that tree for?
###1432 
###1436 Whoa.
###1437 747.
###1438 HEIMO KORTH: It has to be.
###1439 JOHN MARTIN: Do you like seeing the planes?
###1441 HEIMO KORTH: In some way, yeah.
###1442 Because it's--
###1443 even though we got radio, it's still, it's like, there are
###1446 people out there.
###1447 You know what I mean?
###1449 THOMAS MORTON: It's nice to have a little contact.
###1450 HEIMO KORTH: Yeah.
###1451 Like when 9/11 was there, you know, remember they stopped
###1454 all air traffic for a while?
###1457 And there was no jets.
###1460 Zero.
###1461 Nothing.
###1463 Almost felt kind of lonely, you know?
###1464 THOMAS MORTON: Did you hear about 9/11 on the radio?
###1467 HEIMO KORTH: Well, I heard on the radio.
###1469 I was like, what?
###1471 So you know, but I never have seen actual footage of the jet
###1475 hitting the towers.
###1475 THOMAS MORTON: No?
###1476 HEIMO KORTH: I've never seen that in my life.
###1478 Never.
###1478 Because we were out here, there's no TV.
###1480 
###1483 OK, first one.
###1484 Now watch.
###1486 You see the bottom there and everything?
###1488 Just set this down like this, and push it into the mud good.
###1494 OK, that's the first one.
###1496 Now we put one more with a bunch of sticks like this.
###1498 
###1505 That's it.
###1508 It's just so vast, huh?
###1509 It just goes forever and ever and ever.
###1512 No roads, no trails, no people, nothing.
###1516 
###1519 THOMAS MORTON: I don't know whether that's comforting or
###1520 terrifying.
###1522 HEIMO KORTH: It's comforting to me, but it
###1523 depends the way you're--
###1525 everybody feels different about that, you know?
###1529 I feel safe that way.
###1532 I feel safe.
###1534 
###1551 Have you checked [INAUDIBLE] mountain?
###1555 Goroy Mountain?
###1557 Let me have the binoculars.
###1558 Let me look over there on them mountains.
###1560 
###1568 THOMAS MORTON: Heimo just saw a bunch of caribou coming down
###1571 off the ridge, so we're going to go up on the tundra and try
###1574 to head them off.
###1576 This is the Korths' last chance to get some meat.
###1579 They're well stocked.
###1581 They could survive without it, but you know, it would be nice
###1584 for them before the herd heads off, if they
###1587 could take one more.
###1588 
###1591 HEIMO KORTH (WHISPERING): If something scared them, yeah.
###1593 If they ran into a wolf or bear.
###1598 Shit.
###1599 Yeah, oh, yeah.
###1601 Oh yes.
###1601 Damn.
###1604 Well, when they came out, they cut that way.
###1607 That's--
###1608 no caribou today yet.
###1610 Maybe on the way home.
###1611 Who knows?
###1612 We'll find out.
###1614 Just keep trudging along.
###1615 
###1623 Something killed a calf caribou here.
###1625 Either wolf-- wolverine-- or bear.
###1626 One of the two.
###1627 THOMAS MORTON: Oh, yeah, look at all that fur.
###1631 HEIMO KORTH: The bones, see the pelvis bone, the back one?
###1633 THOMAS MORTON: How long ago, do you think?
###1634 HEIMO KORTH: Oh, I don't know.
###1635 That was probably when we--
###1636 when all them caribou came through
###1638 in the end of September.
###1640 THOMAS MORTON: Ooh.
###1641 Grisly.
###1642 
###1646 [DOG BARKING]
###1648 HEIMO KORTH: Let me get the saw.
###1650 
###1658 See all the eggs in there?
###1660 Full of eggs.
###1661 
###1667 [GENERATOR MOTOR]
###1691 HEIMO KORTH: Oh, that's out here, east somewhere.
###1694 I'm into movies somewhat, you know?
###1696 I like the sci-fi movies, you know, like aliens
###1699 and stuff like that.
###1700 I like stuff like that.
###1703 Transporter, Born in East LA, Addams Family.
###1706 Munich takes a long time.
###1707 That's like almost a three-hour movie.
###1710 JOHN MARTIN: Predator or whatever.
###1711 THOMAS MORTON: That night after looking through family
###1712 photos on Edna's gas-powered laptop--
###1714 HEIMO KORTH: We'll watch this one.
###1715 THOMAS MORTON: Heimo treated us to a special
###1717 screening of Predator.
###1719 The irony of watching Major Alan "Dutch" Schaefer try to
###1722 trap and kill Predator in the company of a fur trapper did
###1725 not escape us.
###1727 Nor did Heimo waste any opportunity to point out when
###1730 and how Schwarzenegger's various Predator traps were
###1732 total bullshit.
###1734 At this point, it was very easy to forget that we were on
###1737 the furthest brink of human civilization and not just
###1739 sprawled out on a friend's couch, basking in the glow of
###1742 a TBS staple.
###1743 
###1755 Apparently there were bear tracks near where the outhouse
###1758 is. (SOFTLY) What the fuck are they doing?
###1761 The next morning, our feelings of suburban safety and
###1763 contentment were vanquished for good by the discovery of
###1766 bear tracks near the cabin.
###1767 JOHN MARTIN: Here they come again.
###1771 HEIMO KORTH: Good morning.
###1772 THOMAS MORTON: Good morning?
###1773 HEIMO KORTH: We'll show you.
###1775 JOHN MARTIN: See, you went to find the tracks?
###1777 HEIMO KORTH: Yeah.
###1777 We'll--
###1778 we'll have to show you.
###1779 We gotta get rid of him.
###1780 Because otherwise he's going to wreck your tents and
###1783 everything.
###1784 
###1789 HEIMO KORTH (WHISPERING): He came to right there.
###1791 That's the track, yeah.
###1794 Those paws are enormous.
###1798 THOMAS MORTON: This is the time of year that bears are
###1799 putting on their last few pounds before going into
###1801 hibernation.
###1803 And Heimo guaranteed us that our nocturnal visitor would
###1805 not only be returning soon but would continue to do so until
###1808 either it was dead or we were.
###1811 HEIMO KORTH: See where he scraped the ground to cover
###1812 the carcass?
###1814 THOMAS MORTON (WHISPERING): Where's the carcass?
###1815 HEIMO KORTH (WHISPERING): Under all that.
###1816 He covers it.
###1816 THOMAS MORTON (WHISPERING): He's probably nearby?
###1818 HEIMO KORTH: Mmhm.
###1821 And guaranteed to attack us.
###1823 If he comes behind us, I want you to duck
###1825 down like that, so--
###1826 'cause I'm going to shoot over you.
###1828 [WHISTLE]
###1829 Hey, bear.
###1831 Hey.
###1832 JOHN MARTIN: Hey.
###1833 
###1844 HEIMO KORTH: Pretty spooky back there, huh?
###1846 THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.
###1847 Just with the carcass, and--
###1848 so is he eating the other bear carcass?
###1850 HEIMO KORTH: Oh, yeah.
###1851 They do that all the time.
###1852 One bear'll eat another bear carcass.
###1854 THOMAS MORTON: No manners amongst bears.
###1855 HEIMO KORTH: Well, remember he raked it all in and covered
###1858 the carcass like that?
###1858 THOMAS MORTON: Oh, you got to see the carcass.
###1860 All our farcical bear alarm jokes from earlier in the week
###1862 were revisited, but this time in deadly earnest.
###1866 If we so much as needed to shit, we had to take a shotgun
###1869 with us and establish that we were in clear shouting
###1871 distance of someone else.
###1872 JOHN MCSHANE: Apparently there were bear tracks near where
###1875 the outhouse is.
###1876 I've been told to carry this with me.
###1877 EDNA KORTH: Don't shoot this way.
###1879 JOHN MCSHANE: Right.
###1880 EDNA KORTH: If you see him on that side,
###1881 shoot at him that way.
###1882 JOHN MCSHANE: Right.
###1883 And a killing shot is where?
###1884 Like head or the heart?
###1885 EDNA KORTH: In the chest.
###1886 JOHN MCSHANE: Chest?
###1886 EDNA KORTH: Yeah.
###1888 
###1896 JOHN MARTIN: Good luck.
###1897 JOHN MCSHANE: Thanks.
###1898 
###1901 THOMAS MORTON: So we're eating moose tacos tonight?
###1904 EDNA KORTH: Yeah.
###1905 THOMAS MORTON: Taco night.
###1907 EDNA KORTH: Heimo's favorite.
###1910 Usually I'll just have two taco shells tonight, and
###1913 there's 10 or 12 in a box.
###1916 He'll eat the rest.
###1917 THOMAS MORTON: Do your daughters eat a lot?
###1919 EDNA KORTH: Yeah.
###1920 THOMAS MORTON: Were you worried when they were little
###1921 about bringing them up out here?
###1923 EDNA KORTH: Oh, no.
###1924 THOMAS MORTON: No?
###1924 EDNA KORTH: Uh-uh.
###1926 I taught them from since they were five.
###1930 THOMAS MORTON: Heimo told me they went to boarding school
###1933 for a couple years.
###1934 EDNA KORTH: Yeah.
###1935 Both of the girls did, because I think it's
###1938 time for them to move.
###1940 I didn't want--
###1941 I told him I didn't want to teach them anymore because I
###1945 don't want to do high school again.
###1950 There.
###1952 We just opened it.
###1953 It's too hot.
###1955 HEIMO KORTH: It's too cold.
###1957 The first taco I ever had, it's like, I fell
###1960 in love with it.
###1961 Man, what have I been missing all these years?
###1963 Oh, it was good.
###1964 Ooh, I loved it.
###1965 Any kind of Mexican food, I had to come to
###1967 Alaska to have it first.
###1969 Alaska.
###1971 This year's exceptionally weird.
###1972 It really is.
###1974 This is the third time a neighbor come in.
###1976 THOMAS MORTON: I think that is.
###1977 There more of them?
###1978 HEIMO KORTH: I think so.
###1979 I think so.
###1980 Until everything's resolved, we're going to
###1982 have to stick close.
###1985 THOMAS MORTON: What'll it sound like?
###1987 HEIMO KORTH: The dog'll tell us in a heartbeat.
###1991 Me and Edna, and you and you, we're gonna have to boogie out
###1998 real quick and take care of it.
###2001 EDNA KORTH: I'll be the last person.
###2004 HEIMO KORTH: You're gonna be right with us.
###2006 'Cause you and me'll be in the lead.
###2009 Especially you.
###2011 You'll be--
###2013 
###2019 THOMAS MORTON: Heimo just heard the dog bark.
###2020 [DOG BARKING]
###2022 THOMAS MORTON: We may, we may have gotten our visitor.
###2026 [DOG BARKING]
###2028 HEIMO KORTH: Come on, come on.
###2030 This is serious.
###2031 He's there.
###2032 EDNA KORTH: Somebody else--
###2034 HEIMO KORTH: No, I need you, Mom.
###2035 Let's go.
###2036 Come on, let's go.
###2036 Mommy, gun's right here.
###2038 Extra shells.
###2039 Hey, John, in that box up there, wooden box.
###2042 Reach for some--
###2044 pack of shotgun shells.
###2045 There are five in there.
###2047 OK?
###2047 When we walk up there, quiet.
###2049 Nobody talk.
###2050 We just have the light.
###2051 
###2059 EDNA KORTH: Ain't for me, Mr. Korth.
###2061 HEIMO KORTH: Don't get upset.
###2063 THOMAS MORTON: It just got dark.
###2065 (WHISPERING) There is a bear.
###2069 [GUNSHOT]
###2070 [GUNSHOT]
###2071 THOMAS MORTON (WHISPERING): Oh my god.
###2073 This is--
###2074 [GUNSHOT]
###2075 [GUNSHOT]
###2077 [GUNSHOT]
###2078 [GUNSHOT]
###2080 [GUNSHOT]
###2082 THOMAS MORTON (WHISPERING): The bear's making some
###2084 terrible fucking noise--
###2085 [GUNSHOT]
###2087 THOMAS MORTON (WHISPERING): Ohh, it sounds
###2091 like the bear's moving.
###2093 [GUNSHOT]
###2099 [GUNSHOT]
###2102 [GUNSHOT]
###2104 [GUNSHOT]
###2108 THOMAS MORTON (WHISPERING): How the
###2109 fuck is it still alive?
###2110 JOHN MCSHANE (WHISPERING): I don't know.
###2112 HEIMO KORTH: It's dead.
###2113 EDNA KORTH: He's dead.
###2114 HEIMO KORTH: Hey, you guys--
###2115 THOMAS MORTON: He's dead?
###2116 Can we come?
###2116 JOHN MCSHANE: We're good?
###2118 
###2120 THOMAS MORTON: We can shit in peace.
###2122 The uh, the bear is dead.
###2125 HEIMO KORTH: Imagine if you got attacked by that.
###2127 JOHN MARTIN: Fuck.
###2128 THOMAS MORTON: Was he on all fours, or was he up high?
###2130 HEIMO KORTH: He was all fours.
###2131 THOMAS MORTON: OK.
###2132 HEIMO KORTH: All fours, and then--
###2133 THOMAS MORTON: That makes it harder to shoot
###2134 him, doesn't it?
###2135 HEIMO KORTH: Once he was hit, he was rolling around all over
###2137 just like a ball, and that was even worse.
###2139 THOMAS MORTON: That's terrifying.
###2140 HEIMO KORTH: To try to shoot him.
###2141 THOMAS MORTON (SHIVERING) Ayyyy, hey, hey.
###2143 HEIMO KORTH: That could take a chunk
###2144 out of you in a heartbeat.
###2145 THOMAS MORTON: Yes.
###2146 HEIMO KORTH: It was so dark that we kept shooting and
###2149 shooting and shooting.
###2150 And I know I missed a bunch because I couldn't see the
###2153 bear in the sights of my gun.
###2155 The dog knew there was something amiss, and then I
###2158 could hear the bear back in there.
###2161 And that's when I ran in the house and
###2163 got Edna and everybody.
###2165 Come on, we gotta go.
###2166 I couldn't see the bear in the sights of my gun.
###2169 And as you saw, it was a big bear.
###2171 It was a really big bear.
###2172 And he's gone, and--
###2176 HEIMO KORTH: And we protected our--
###2178 I mean, us.
###2179 And property.
###2179 Otherwise he might have killed the dog.
###2181 So we lost a dog already.
###2183 A bear came in the yard and ate the dog alive, you know?
###2186 And that was pretty sad.
###2187 That's, you know, that's life in the Arctic.
###2189 THOMAS MORTON: Yeah, Yeah.
###2190 HEIMO KORTH: It's just the way it goes.
###2192 THOMAS MORTON: You guys'll be sleeping good tonight.
###2194 HEIMO KORTH (YAWNING): Well, everybody.
###2195 THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.
###2196 
###2203 Morning.
###2204 I am really a little bit uncertain which one.
###2211 I've got--
###2213 I've got no clue what day of the week it is,
###2215 either, I just realized.
###2218 HEIMO KORTH: Don't fall on 'em.
###2220 Lot of air bubbles, huh?
###2222 
###2228 THOMAS MORTON: How are we looking?
###2230 HEIMO KORTH: Situation looks quite bleak.
###2232 THOMAS MORTON: Oh.
###2235 HEIMO KORTH: Maybe in the morning.
###2238 We'll just come here in the morning and see what's there.
###2241 Just have to do that.
###2242 
###2245 THOMAS MORTON: Gotta go deal with that bear right now.
###2247 It's just, like, lying there in the middle of the trail.
###2248 We're gonna have to skin it, de-skull it, and do something
###2254 with the meat that doesn't involve leaving it for another
###2258 bear to come and try to eat.
###2261 There's the bear.
###2262 Still dead?
###2264 HEIMO KORTH (WHISPERING): Oh, yeah.
###2266 I wouldn't want to fool with a bear like this.
###2269 Because you'd be in deep doo-doo.
###2271 Stinks.
###2272 Whew.
###2274 His belly was full.
###2275 So he stinks pretty bad.
###2276 One, two, three.
###2278 [WHOOSH OF AIR]
###2280 Whew.
###2283 THOMAS MORTON: Oh, ohh.
###2284 Ho, ho.
###2285 He-- ho, ho. (GAGGING) Ho, oh, oh, huh, ho.
###2289 Oh, no.
###2290 Oh, god.
###2291 Oh, that's-- oh.
###2293 HEIMO KORTH: Terrible, huh?
###2294 You get a good whiff of that, huh?
###2295 THOMAS MORTON: Oh, I got plenty.
###2297 He basically just deflated.
###2299 And that air.
###2301 Oh my god.
###2302 HEIMO KORTH: Pretty rank, huh?
###2303 THOMAS MORTON: That was-- that was some, that
###2304 was some rank air.
###2305 That was--
###2305 HEIMO KORTH: OK.
###2306 THOMAS MORTON: That was worse than anything I'm going to do
###2307 on this trip.
###2309 Is this gonna happen again, now?
###2311 HEIMO KORTH: Yeah, he's kind of, kind of
###2312 rigor mortis in here.
###2313 THOMAS MORTON: Ohh.
###2314 
###2317 Ohh.
###2319 HEIMO KORTH: You smell?
###2320 THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.
###2320 Oh, oh.
###2322 HEIMO KORTH: I could use somebody else to help, too.
###2324 You guys spread the arms, OK?
###2326 Watch your fingers.
###2327 
###2330 I learned this from a hunting guy that I worked for.
###2333 He taught me how to skin bears.
###2335 Without him, I wouldn't be up here.
###2336 He's the one that offered me the job, so I moved up here.
###2341 
###2344 OK.
###2344 Now.
###2345 Bend down hard, hard.
###2347 Real hard.
###2347 [SNAPPING BONE]
###2347 HEIMO KORTH: There you go, that's what we needed.
###2350 Now, put on a pair of rubber gloves because you're going to
###2354 grab the meat now.
###2355 I mean, this is more than one slug.
###2357 And right here, look at that.
###2360 You see what I'm saying?
###2363 Like I feel like a lot of people would see this and just
###2366 automatically be like, this guy must hate animals.
###2368 HEIMO KORTH: No, I don't hate animals.
###2369 Not in the least.
###2371 Because I want to see them here all the time.
###2373 I do.
###2374 THOMAS MORTON: Well, you live among them.
###2375 HEIMO KORTH: Everybody, Everybody's ancestors were
###2378 hunters and trappers.
###2379 Everybody.
###2380 
###2387 Hold that leg, grab this one.
###2389 You and me--
###2390 you and me, Thomas, pull this one.
###2392 You gotta lift it up.
###2393 It's gonna be hard.
###2394 One, two, three.
###2395 There we go, there we go, there we go.
###2397 Just like this.
###2400 OK.
###2400 Tell you what.
###2401 To keep that clean, fold that there like that.
###2404 That's good.
###2404 There we go.
###2405 Put your fingers in the nose and--
###2407 no, really.
###2408 Can you do it?
###2409 THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.
###2409 Oh, that feels kind of odd.
###2411 HEIMO KORTH: Now, OK.
###2412 Now.
###2413 
###2417 THOMAS MORTON: Oh, there's the ears.
###2418 There's the eye holes.
###2418 HEIMO KORTH: There you go.
###2420 THOMAS MORTON: There's our bear.
###2421 HEIMO KORTH: I gotta cut that skull off.
###2422 The skull has to be brought to the Alaska
###2425 Department of Fish and Game.
###2426 I mushed up the skull bad.
###2429 Ooh.
###2429 THOMAS MORTON: These are all shots that are gonna give me
###2432 nightmares.
###2434 
###2440 HEIMO KORTH: It's not so bloody this way,
###2441 you know what I mean?
###2443 
###2447 OK, push it down like this.
###2448 
###2452 OK.
###2452 There.
###2453 One, two, three.
###2457 Once we get on the snow, it'll be easier.
###2461 THOMAS MORTON: It is easier.
###2463 JOHN MCSHANE: Funeral procession for a bear.
###2465 
###2470 HEIMO KORTH: To there.
###2472 
###2474 That's good.
###2476 OK.
###2478 
###2480 Well, let's go check snares.
###2484 THOMAS MORTON: When do you start getting really busy with
###2486 the trapping?
###2486 Like when does that kick in?
###2487 HEIMO KORTH: November.
###2488 THOMAS MORTON: November?
###2489 And how long does it last?
###2491 HEIMO KORTH: Until March, I'll be really busy,
###2493 trapping every day.
###2495 Nothing?
###2497 First one empty.
###2498 See it?
###2498 Right down here.
###2500 See the snare you set there?
###2502 David's is empty.
###2503 
###2507 Ooh.
###2508 Too much fox and wolverine hanging around.
###2511 THOMAS MORTON: So that's why we don't have--
###2512 HEIMO KORTH: That's why the bunnies-- you know, they
###2514 either killed 'em, or else the bunnies took off to Timbuktu.
###2516 Because they ain't gonna stand around with all these
###2518 wolverines and foxes around.
###2521 Who set this one?
###2522 THOMAS MORTON: Um, maybe me?
###2524 HEIMO KORTH: You got a bunny.
###2526 There's part of supper.
###2527 THOMAS MORTON: Look at that.
###2529 These things are really big.
###2532 Wow.
###2533 I snared my first bunny.
###2535 HEIMO KORTH: Yeah.
###2536 THOMAS MORTON: Oh, I'm sorry it was a struggle, but I'm
###2538 happy we have food.
###2539 HEIMO KORTH: Christ, see, this guy, he caught a fish, and he
###2543 got a bunny.
###2545 THOMAS MORTON: Heimo got a bunny, but it's alive.
###2547 
###2550 How are--
###2551 how are you going to dispatch this bunny?
###2553 
###2572 Is that the--
###2573 is that the final--?
###2577 I got to admit, that was a little bit rough.
###2578 HEIMO KORTH: What's up?
###2579 What was?
###2580 THOMAS MORTON: You know, it's kind of like, buying it at the
###2581 supermarket, was the first time that we just-- we found
###2585 it and it was, the deed had already been done.
###2587 HEIMO KORTH: And this time I had to do it?
###2588 THOMAS MORTON: And this time, you had to do it, yeah.
###2590 So you have to--
###2591 I'd have to get used to that.
###2592 HEIMO KORTH: Well, I grew up like that.
###2593 THOMAS MORTON: Does it ever--
###2594 does it ever affect you?
###2595 HEIMO KORTH: Bother me?
###2596 THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.
###2598 You ever feel bad for--
###2600 you ever feel bad for the bunny?
###2601 HEIMO KORTH: Well, it didn't suffer.
###2602 I mean--
###2604 THOMAS MORTON: No more than it would in the wild.
###2605 HEIMO KORTH: Oh, god, no.
###2606 THOMAS MORTON: I mean, I order rabbit on menus.
###2609 Just because I don't see it happening doesn't mean it's
###2611 not happening.
###2611 And it's probably happening a lot worse than what you did.
###2613 HEIMO KORTH: You're darn right, it is.
###2615 Hey, I'll show you once.
###2616 And then the next one, you do, OK?
###2618 THOMAS MORTON: I do myself, OK.
###2619 HEIMO KORTH: OK.
###2620 Wet your hands a little bit.
###2622 Right where this joint is, there, just--
###2624 just in that joint area, pull it like this
###2627 and the skin'll pop.
###2628 THOMAS MORTON: Wow.
###2628 No knife cuts.
###2630 HEIMO KORTH: No knife cuts.
###2631 Stick your finger right here, go right to the butthole area,
###2636 and come up and around.
###2638 You grab the whole tail part and everything, the poop chute
###2640 and all that, pull it like this.
###2644 THOMAS MORTON: You know, there wasn't a time when, like, all
###2646 us animals hung out together.
###2649 We treat them--
###2649 HEIMO KORTH: All animals are not people.
###2651 That's a Disney world.
###2652 I mean, people that say, my cat, or else my dog, that's my
###2655 kid, that's my child-- that's a bunch of baloney.
###2658 It's not even close.
###2659 There.
###2660 OK, just cut up, now.
###2661 Cut up.
###2661 Up.
###2662 They can have their dogs and pets, you
###2664 know what I'm saying?
###2665 I mean, that's not going to come close to
###2667 another human being.
###2668 You can't rate an animal with a human.
###2670 That's not right.
###2672 There.
###2674 Skinned and gutted your first bunny.
###2675 THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.
###2677 
###2693 HEIMO KORTH: You guys ready?
###2696 Ready?
###2697 Of we go into the wild blue yonder.
###2700 THOMAS MORTON: Can you tell me where we're
###2700 walking to right now?
###2702 HEIMO KORTH: Oh, we're going to go up in the ridge, by our
###2705 daughter's cross up there.
###2707 The daughter we lost out here, we put
###2709 flowers there every year.
###2711 So that's what we're going up there for now.
###2715 THOMAS MORTON: Heimo and Edna's daughters, Krin and
###2717 Rhonda, are grown and live in Fairbanks now.
###2720 Heimo and Edna, however, had another daughter named Coleen
###2723 before either of them was born.
###2725 When Coleen was two, she and her parents were crossing the
###2727 Coleen river in a canoe when it tipped over and she was
###2730 swept away by the current.
###2732 EDNA KORTH: We were floating down to the lower cabin.
###2735 We had that sweeper on the bank.
###2739 It tip us over.
###2741 She drowned and floated.
###2743 We couldn't reach her in time.
###2748 The only thing we found from her was her little boot.
###2750 
###2754 We call it Goroy Mountain.
###2756 We named it after our daughter.
###2760 We used to call her, in Eskimo, little pigs that eat a
###2764 lot, we say, goroys.
###2768 
###2777 THOMAS MORTON: Did you try to have this hill renamed?
###2780 HEIMO KORTH: Yeah.
###2780 You gotta go through a couple committees.
###2782 The state said that she didn't do anything significant.
###2786 THOMAS MORTON: That's awful.
###2787 HEIMO KORTH: They said.
###2788 
###2790 EDNA KORTH: She would have been 27, 28 years this year.
###2804 HEIMO KORTH: [ESKIMO]
###2805 That's the Eskimo word for "come." [ESKIMO]
###2811 HEIMO KORTH: Say it, Mom.
###2812 EDNA KORTH: [ESKIMO]
###2813 THOMAS MORTON: Sounds a lot nicer when she says it.
###2816 EDNA KORTH: I told you, you make things yours.
###2819 HEIMO KORTH: Oh, come on.
###2821 Well, this is something we were going to do whether you
###2823 guys were here or not.
###2825 We had to do it before the snow got too deep.
###2828 And it's a beautiful day for it.
###2831 
###2854 HEIMO KORTH: I don't know how to use one of these things.
###2855 EDNA KORTH: Just press.
###2856 HEIMO KORTH: Oh, there.
###2857 
###2911 HEIMO KORTH: You want this?
###2914 Yeah.
###2914 You want this?
###2915 There, there you go.
###2919 She's a real picky eater in the beginning, but once she
###2922 starts, she won't stop.
###2925 THOMAS MORTON: Does it bum you out that there aren't a new
###2927 generation of Heimos and Ednas to come out here?
###2932 That once you guys are gone, there probably won't be--
###2934 in ANWR, there won't be another--
###2937 another set of people.
###2938 HEIMO KORTH: Another final frontiersman?
###2939 THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.
###2940 HEIMO KORTH: I mean, the youth nowadays, very few are
###2942 interested in the outdoors.
###2944 And a lot of them don't know survival skills, which is sad.
###2950 Because they could run into a situation where they need that
###2952 to save their life, you know?
###2954 Because you never know what's going to happen in life.
###2956 
###2969 THOMAS MORTON: Last day of camp.
###2971 We got little gifts from Edna.
###2973 She made us--
###2974 mine is a fox skin chain toggle, which I'm pretty
###2977 excited about.
###2978 Gonna miss this old cabin.
###2980 All right, this is it.
###2982 Supposed to be snow coming in tonight, and the seasons are
###2985 about to change in a really major way.
###2987 It's going to get a lot colder than it's been
###2989 when we've been here.
###2990 And hunting season's going to give way to trapping season.
###2993 
###3008 Folks like Heimo and Edna, and the bush pilots out here,
###3011 they're some of the last people from whom you can learn
###3015 this dying skill set.
###3017 They ain't supermen.
###3018 They're ordinary people who learned how to do it and then
###3022 went out and did it.
###3023 I'm now capable of feasting off rabbit that I have caught.
###3029 These are all, you know--
###3032 these are all skills we can rediscover.
###3034 
###3041 HEIMO KORTH: All right, guys.
###3042 THOMAS MORTON: Bye.
###3042 HEIMO KORTH: Take care.
###3043 THOMAS MORTON: Have a good winter.
###3044 HEIMO KORTH: Yeah, you too.
###3044 THOMAS MORTON: We will.
###3045 HEIMO KORTH: All right, bye.
###3047 
###3071 Me and Edna, we got our-- when we go, you know, I told her if
###3075 I go first, where to put me.
###3077 I mean, if they find me out here.
###3079 That's the thing.
###3080 If they find me.
###3081 And then my ashes are going to be way up in there.
###3085 That's where I wanted them.
###3086 And then Edna said she wants to be here, you know.
###3089
