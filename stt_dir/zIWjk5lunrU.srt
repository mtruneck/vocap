And when they find out what
you're doing to one of their own...

At least I got the right one.

Happiest ever.


204
0:12:37,32 --> 0:12:38,392
We had each other.


205
0:12:38,392 --> 0:12:40,592
The kids.


206
0:12:40,592 --> 0:12:41,753
So what happened?


207
0:12:41,753 --> 0:12:45,392
I couldn't give her what she wanted.
I tried.


208
0:12:45,392 --> 0:12:47,392
Had this job in Fuengirola.


209
0:12:47,392 --> 0:12:49,952
We were just scraping by,
but we were together.


210
0:12:49,952 --> 0:12:53,312
Anyway, before long...


211
0:12:53,312 --> 0:12:56,552
She found someone who could give her
what she wanted.


212
0:12:56,552 --> 0:12:58,672
She left you.


213
0:12:58,672 --> 0:13:0,232
Took my kids.


214
0:13:0,232 --> 0:13:4,992
Arsin-arsin-arsin' around behind

tight trousered bastards.
Put the fire out! She...


218
0:13:14,32 --> 0:13:18,912

0:22:25,32 --> 0:22:27,512
The lady loves...


378
0:22:27,512 --> 0:22:30,992
LAUGHTER


379
0:22:30,992 --> 0:22:33,792
It's hurting.


380
0:22:33,792 --> 0:22:36,192
And I pledge to thee my purity.


381
0:22:36,192 --> 0:22:38,792
ALL: And I pledge to thee my purity.


382
0:22:38,792 --> 0:22:41,72
And I pledge to thee my faith.


383
0:22:41,72 --> 0:22:43,272
ALL: And I pledge to thee my faith.


384
0:22:43,272 --> 0:22:45,952
Now and for ever. Amen.


385
0:22:45,952 --> 0:22:49,392
ALL: Now and for ever. Amen.


386
0:22:49,392 --> 0:22:51,952
All right, crisps and pop coming up.


387
0:22:51,952 --> 0:22:56,872
Enjoy!


388
0:22:56,872 --> 0:22:58,792
You missed it.


389
0:22:58,792 --> 0:22:59,513
The prayer session.


390
0:22:59,513 --> 0:23:0,592
I know.


391
0:23:0,592 --> 0:23:3,272
You can't just turn up
for the games, crisps and pop.


392
0:23:3,272 --> 0:23:5,591
You can't just reap the rewards.
You have to put the time in.


393
0:23:5,591 --> 0:23:6,633
It's all new to me.


394
0:23:6,633 --> 0:23:10,952
Like a big family, innit?


395
0:23:10,952 --> 0:23:12,872
I'll be on time, next time.


396
0:23:12,872 --> 0:23:14,792
Erm...


397
0:23:14,792 --> 0:23:18,632
I'm sure God wouldn't mind
me making an exception.


398
0:23:18,632 --> 0:23:29,472
Monster Munch or Nibletts?


399
0:23:29,472 --> 0:23:32,792
Your cronies are fucking up
business in the pub.


400
0:23:32,792 --> 0:23:34,72
And the shop.


401
0:23:34,72 --> 0:23:35,192
And Lillian's.


402
0:23:35,192 --> 0:23:36,313
You have to stop. Now.


403
0:23:36,313 --> 0:23:38,472
I can't.


404
0:23:38,472 --> 0:23:41,192
I wouldn't put myself
in the middle of it, Patty.


405
0:23:41,192 --> 0:23:44,992
Jesus was never afraid of a fight
and neither am I, Jamie.


406
0:23:44,992 --> 0:23:45,673
I'd sooner not do this.


407
0:23:45,673 --> 0:23:48,232
Well, then don't.
Leave the devil behind


408
0:23:48,232 --> 0:23:50,512
and look for salvation.
Before it's too late.


409
0:23:50,512 --> 0:24:13,512
I want you off the estate
this time tomorrow.


410
0:24:13,512 --> 0:24:17,912
No wonder your crew knew
all there is to know about everyone.


411
0:24:17,912 --> 0:24:20,192
The font of all knowledge, hey?


412
0:24:20,192 --> 0:24:22,592
I know how people
might redeem themselves.


413
0:24:22,592 --> 0:24:26,352
Since he shone his light,
my life is finally worth living


414
0:24:26,352 --> 0:24:28,112
and yours could be too,


415
0:24:28,112 --> 0:24:29,872
so hallelujah!


416
0:24:29,872 --> 0:24:31,672
ALL: Hallelujah!


417
0:24:31,672 --> 0:24:33,952
Join us in the light.


418
0:24:33,952 --> 0:24:38,272
And let his love illuminate
the darkest corners of your life.


419
0:24:38,272 --> 0:24:41,392
I don't really do religion,
I'm a Catholic.


420
0:24:41,392 --> 0:24:45,272
You think the Lord will forgive you
for all you've done? Beware!


421
0:24:45,272 --> 0:24:48,32
You beware. If you think
I'm going to let you and yours


422
0:24:48,32 --> 0:24:51,672
fuck up my nearest and dearest,
you're wrong.


423
0:24:51,672 --> 0:24:53,392
No-one messes with my family.


424
0:24:53,392 --> 0:24:56,72
If you think we're a pushover,
think again.


425
0:24:56,72 --> 0:24:58,192
Blow it out your arse.


426
0:24:58,192 --> 0:25:3,152
I'm New Testament, your mumbo
jumbo scaremongery's lost on me.


427
0:25:3,152 --> 0:25:5,952
You want trouble, Patty,
bring it on!


428
0:25:5,952 --> 0:25:13,992
Verily, God will visit upon you
fire and brimstone and damnation!


429
0:25:13,992 --> 0:25:16,872
The earth shall weep, Mimi.


430
0:25:16,872 --> 0:25:24,712
The earth shall weep!


431
0:25:24,712 --> 0:25:27,392
Pepperoni, madam.


432
0:25:27,392 --> 0:25:29,912
Extra basil like you asked.


433
0:25:29,912 --> 0:25:33,352
I meant on the pizza.


434
0:25:33,352 --> 0:25:41,192
Well, basil on tap. You can
have it any time you want now.


435
0:25:41,192 --> 0:25:43,192
I'm glad you're not
in a hurry to get home.


436
0:25:43,192 --> 0:25:47,472
No-one to hurry to.
Shane's out on family business.


437
0:25:47,472 --> 0:25:49,272
You mean kicking somebody's arse?


438
0:25:49,272 --> 0:25:52,872
Or telling someone they're going
to get their arse kicked.


439
0:25:52,872 --> 0:25:54,552
Not sure what he gets up to lately


440
0:25:54,552 --> 0:25:58,192
but I'm pretty sure it involves
arses and kicking.


441
0:25:58,192 --> 0:26:5,632
Can't be easy being
married to a Maguire.


442
0:26:5,632 --> 0:26:11,592
Bit of an effort lately.


443
0:26:11,592 --> 0:26:13,952
All marriages go through
funny patches, eh?


444
0:26:13,952 --> 0:26:15,72
Yep.


445
0:26:15,72 --> 0:26:15,713
It'll just be a funny patch.


446
0:26:15,713 --> 0:26:18,952
Yeah.


447
0:26:18,952 --> 0:26:20,753
Mam said we need to be on red alert.


448
0:26:20,753 --> 0:26:22,512
What does that mean?


449
0:26:22,512 --> 0:26:25,832
Patty's made a threat which Mam
thinks we need to take seriously.


450
0:26:25,832 --> 0:26:28,632
So there's a family pow wow
later to decide the next move.


451
0:26:28,632 --> 0:26:31,552
Hiya. What you been up to?


452
0:26:31,552 --> 0:26:37,552
Not much. Someone nearly got
their arse kicked, that's all. You?


453
0:26:37,552 --> 0:26:39,32
Been with a client.


454
0:26:39,32 --> 0:26:40,792
Can you smoke that?


455
0:26:40,792 --> 0:26:41,832
It's basil.


456
0:26:41,832 --> 0:26:43,73
You've give it a name?


457
0:26:43,73 --> 0:26:45,952
No, Micky. Everyone calls it basil.


458
0:26:45,952 --> 0:26:47,192
What's it for?


459
0:26:47,192 --> 0:26:50,512
Cooking. Stick it in a pasta,
top of pizzas.


460
0:26:50,512 --> 0:26:51,911
We're having pasta again?


461
0:26:51,911 --> 0:26:53,313
No, we're not having pasta.


462
0:26:53,313 --> 0:26:55,152
What the fuck you buy it for then?


463
0:26:55,152 --> 0:26:55,993
It's a gift.


464
0:26:55,993 --> 0:26:57,512
Some perv's buying you a plant


465
0:26:57,512 --> 0:26:59,592
as a thank you
for paying to fuck you?


466
0:26:59,592 --> 0:27:13,912
It wasn't a perv.
It was Marty.


467
0:27:13,912 --> 0:27:15,393
So he's buying you a plant?


468
0:27:15,393 --> 0:27:17,992
Shane! Punter have bought me
watches before now.


469
0:27:17,992 --> 0:27:21,512
Red roses marking the anniversary
of when they first fucked me


470
0:27:21,512 --> 0:27:24,672
and you and me, we laughed at that.


471
0:27:24,672 --> 0:27:26,32
Why's it bothering you?


472
0:27:26,32 --> 0:27:28,512
You do not buy a plant.


473
0:27:28,512 --> 0:27:31,832
We were just having a laugh. We just
got talking about stuff we liked...


474
0:27:31,832 --> 0:27:35,192
Shane!


475
0:27:35,192 --> 0:27:38,352
Shane, come on! This is stupid!


476
0:27:38,352 --> 0:27:39,593
Shane, will you...


477
0:27:39,593 --> 0:27:40,792
Fuck off.


478
0:27:40,792 --> 0:27:43,352
It's a plant. A fucking plant.


479
0:27:43,352 --> 0:27:50,872
It was a joke, a thank you,
that's all.


480
0:27:50,872 --> 0:27:52,192
Shane!


481
0:27:52,192 --> 0:27:57,112
Stop it! Shane!


482
0:27:57,112 --> 0:27:58,393
Shane, stop it.


483
0:27:58,393 --> 0:27:59,632
Shane?


484
0:27:59,632 --> 0:28:2,672
Stop it now. No! No!


485
0:28:2,672 --> 0:28:5,912
Shane! Leave it. Leave it.


486
0:28:5,912 --> 0:28:8,512
Fuck off. It's none of
your business. Fucking do one!


487
0:28:8,512 --> 0:28:10,152
Are you OK, love?


488
0:28:10,152 --> 0:28:11,192
Just leave.


489
0:28:11,192 --> 0:28:12,752
(GRUNTS)


490
0:28:12,752 --> 0:28:15,432
What the fuck are you doing?!


491
0:28:15,432 --> 0:28:18,192
Fuck's this about?!


492
0:28:18,192 --> 0:28:19,752
There's no need,


493
0:28:19,752 --> 0:28:22,32
absolutely no need!


494
0:28:22,32 --> 0:28:24,192
He stays away.


495
0:28:24,192 --> 0:28:26,112
You don't say who can and can't...


496
0:28:26,112 --> 0:28:28,952
You are my wife!


497
0:28:28,952 --> 0:28:31,312
Kelly Maguire.


498
0:28:31,312 --> 0:28:33,312
You got that?


499
0:28:33,312 --> 0:28:33,953
Maguire.


500
0:28:33,953 --> 0:28:37,192
And don't I fucking know it!


501
0:28:37,192 --> 0:28:42,232
Come on. I said come on.


502
0:28:42,232 --> 0:28:43,832
(CRIES)


503
0:28:43,832 --> 0:28:49,112
(MOANS)


504
0:28:49,112 --> 0:28:51,312
What's it like living round here?


505
0:28:51,312 --> 0:28:52,912
Better than where I used to live.


506
0:28:52,912 --> 0:28:55,192
We shouldn't even be
talking to each other.


507
0:28:55,192 --> 0:28:57,872
Being on opposing sides, you mean?


508
0:28:57,872 --> 0:29:0,992
The Maguires have asked me to find
out what your lot are planning.


509
0:29:0,992 --> 0:29:4,872
And I've been asked to find out
what the Maguires are planning.


510
0:29:4,872 --> 0:29:6,152
Fuck 'em.


511
0:29:6,152 --> 0:29:8,152
Fuck 'em all.


512
0:29:8,152 --> 0:29:9,792
I'll pray for your soul.


513
0:29:9,792 --> 0:29:11,712
Don't you ever get pissed off?


514
0:29:11,712 --> 0:29:14,592
I mean, um, bored,
doing this all the time?


515
0:29:14,592 --> 0:29:18,792
If I can get through to one person,
just one, it'll have been worthwhile.


516
0:29:18,792 --> 0:29:23,792
PHONE RINGS


517
0:29:23,792 --> 0:29:25,752
Yes, mate.


518
0:29:25,752 --> 0:29:28,72
Never just want a bit of fun?


519
0:29:28,72 --> 0:29:29,512
I do have fun.


520
0:29:29,512 --> 0:29:33,192
I enjoy my work, my mission.


521
0:29:33,192 --> 0:29:36,32
Look, I believe in God but
only for an hour on a Sunday.


522
0:29:36,32 --> 0:29:38,192
It hasn't taken over my whole life.


523
0:29:38,192 --> 0:29:40,512
It needs to.


524
0:29:40,512 --> 0:29:44,872
Don't you just want
a bit of excitement?


525
0:29:44,872 --> 0:29:46,552
BANG


526
0:29:46,552 --> 0:30:3,912
ALARM RINGS


527
0:30:3,912 --> 0:30:7,112
Fuck.


528
0:30:7,112 --> 0:30:9,232
These fuckers are harder
than we thought.


529
0:30:9,232 --> 0:30:11,752
Willing to go to any lengths
to prove their point.


530
0:30:11,752 --> 0:30:14,792
It might not have been them.


531
0:30:14,792 --> 0:30:16,273
Who else could it have been?


532
0:30:16,273 --> 0:30:20,272
I told Patty the score,
she threw down the gauntlet.


533
0:30:20,272 --> 0:30:22,152
This is war.


534
0:30:22,152 --> 0:30:25,512
So much for peace and goodwill, eh?


535
0:30:25,512 --> 0:30:29,952
Me and my Brendan was involved
in an explosion once. 1972.


536
0:30:29,952 --> 0:30:33,32
We were on a cruise,
celebrating us anniversary.


537
0:30:33,32 --> 0:30:35,472
Having dinner
at the Captains' table,


538
0:30:35,472 --> 0:30:37,832
when suddenly,
this God almighty bang...


539
0:30:37,832 --> 0:30:41,192
and the ship tipped.
Felt it... wham.


540
0:30:41,192 --> 0:30:44,512
And within an hour,
the whole vessel were upside down.


541
0:30:44,512 --> 0:30:49,232
We were trapped.


542
0:30:49,232 --> 0:30:52,352
That was the Poseidon Adventure.


543
0:30:52,352 --> 0:30:55,32
Did it not happen?


544
0:30:55,32 --> 0:30:58,872
So we're just going to sit here,
let 'em get away with it?


545
0:30:58,872 --> 0:31:2,32
Would you be doing this if I'd have
been blown to fuckin' pieces?


546
0:31:2,32 --> 0:31:3,632
No.


547
0:31:3,632 --> 0:31:5,232
So what do we do?


548
0:31:5,232 --> 0:31:6,832
Go round there and we nail them.


549
0:31:6,832 --> 0:31:9,712
What? You mean kill them?
Kill Jesus?


550
0:31:9,712 --> 0:31:10,513
Kill 'em all.


551
0:31:10,513 --> 0:31:12,272
We tried the gentle approach,


552
0:31:12,272 --> 0:31:14,192
and they wouldn't listen.


553
0:31:14,192 --> 0:31:16,912
Your answer to everything that,
isn't it?


554
0:31:16,912 --> 0:31:17,793
What do you suggest?


555
0:31:17,793 --> 0:31:20,832
I dunno. Anything but that.


556
0:31:20,832 --> 0:31:21,753
It's just wrong.


557
0:31:21,753 --> 0:31:23,392
It's all wrong.


558
0:31:23,392 --> 0:31:37,72
This time tomorrow, our problem
will no longer be our problem.


559
0:31:37,72 --> 0:31:40,632
Kel, Kel! Are you OK?
He didn't hit you?


560
0:31:40,632 --> 0:31:42,872
He wouldn't fucking dare.


561
0:31:42,872 --> 0:31:49,272
Don't come round again, Marty.


562
0:31:49,272 --> 0:31:51,552
Why?


563
0:31:51,552 --> 0:31:52,753
He'll kill you.


564
0:31:52,753 --> 0:31:54,432
I can't just stop seeing you.


565
0:31:54,432 --> 0:31:54,951
You're going to have to.


566
0:31:54,951 --> 0:31:55,753
I can't!


567
0:31:55,753 --> 0:31:57,592
Why the fuck not?


568
0:31:57,592 --> 0:32:6,392
Because I love ya.


569
0:32:6,392 --> 0:32:15,312
I love ya!


570
0:32:15,312 --> 0:32:16,712
You sure you're OK?


571
0:32:16,712 --> 0:32:18,712
Fine, thanks, Auntie.


572
0:32:18,712 --> 0:32:21,112
If you're agreeable,
you could stay with us.


573
0:32:21,112 --> 0:32:25,512
Come with us. Join our Crusade.


574
0:32:25,512 --> 0:32:28,32
You mean it?


575
0:32:28,32 --> 0:32:33,392
Indeed we do.


576
0:32:33,392 --> 0:32:34,432
Where's Grace?


577
0:32:34,432 --> 0:32:37,552
Upstairs, having a lie down.


578
0:32:37,552 --> 0:32:41,192
I'm off on a few messages.


579
0:32:41,192 --> 0:32:44,312
If you need anything,
just call for Jesus.


580
0:32:44,312 --> 0:32:48,792
I'll be in the office.


581
0:32:48,792 --> 0:33:6,752
THUNDER


582
0:33:6,752 --> 0:33:8,392
What you doing?


583
0:33:8,392 --> 0:33:30,752
What's it look like?


584
0:33:30,752 --> 0:33:35,472
It's upside down.


585
0:33:35,472 --> 0:33:56,672
Hey. Jesus?


586
0:33:56,672 --> 0:33:59,72
If you hadn't dragged
my husband off,


587
0:33:59,72 --> 0:34:2,192
he'd have killed that poor bastard
and be looking at a life stretch.


588
0:34:2,192 --> 0:34:3,952
So I owe you.


589
0:34:3,952 --> 0:34:5,33
My lot have had enough


590
0:34:5,33 --> 0:34:7,992
and they plan to make sure
you don't cause no more problems.


591
0:34:7,992 --> 0:34:10,272
When they realise
we pose no threat...


592
0:34:10,272 --> 0:34:11,632
Look, Jesus...


593
0:34:11,632 --> 0:34:14,312
What's your real name?
I can't keep calling you that.


594
0:34:14,312 --> 0:34:16,472
That is my real name.


595
0:34:16,472 --> 0:34:19,312
What did your mam call you?


596
0:34:19,312 --> 0:34:27,712
Fuck's sake, I'm trying
to have a serious conversation.


597
0:34:27,712 --> 0:34:28,752
Eric.


598
0:34:28,752 --> 0:34:31,792
Eric.


599
0:34:31,792 --> 0:34:33,192
Eric.


600
0:34:33,192 --> 0:34:38,672
Some folk respond well
to kindness, a soft touch.


601
0:34:38,672 --> 0:34:40,753
Jamie isn't the type of man
you want to be messing with.


602
0:34:40,753 --> 0:34:43,152
When the Romans came for Christ...


603
0:34:43,152 --> 0:34:45,233
You want to finish up
in the foundations for a flyover...


604
0:34:45,233 --> 0:34:51,272
Sit tight.


605
0:34:51,272 --> 0:34:53,632
There's something
I don't understand.


606
0:34:53,632 --> 0:34:57,192
You're a...


607
0:34:57,192 --> 0:34:58,233
good looking bloke.


608
0:34:58,233 --> 0:35:2,112
Kind, considerate, passionate.


609
0:35:2,112 --> 0:35:5,112
Your love for God
tells me that much.


610
0:35:5,112 --> 0:35:6,351
You never been tempted?


611
0:35:6,351 --> 0:35:7,553
You never been tempted?


612
0:35:7,553 --> 0:35:9,872
I pray to God to keep me pure.


613
0:35:9,872 --> 0:35:11,952
You never longed for that touch?


614
0:35:11,952 --> 0:35:14,712
That euphoria.


615
0:35:14,712 --> 0:35:16,392
Him.


616
0:35:16,392 --> 0:35:17,273
His need.


617
0:35:17,273 --> 0:35:20,872
My need.


618
0:35:20,872 --> 0:35:23,752
When we make love...


619
0:35:23,752 --> 0:35:26,392
I could almost believe in God.


620
0:35:26,392 --> 0:35:27,912
It's that good.


621
0:35:27,912 --> 0:35:32,592
It's that good.


622
0:35:32,592 --> 0:35:33,672
Don't be here.


623
0:35:33,672 --> 0:35:39,712
They're coming.


624
0:35:39,712 --> 0:35:40,992
See ya.


625
0:35:40,992 --> 0:35:44,272
Bye.


626
0:35:44,272 --> 0:35:50,72
Nice shoes, Grace.


627
0:35:50,72 --> 0:36:27,832
You'd better go.


628
0:36:27,832 --> 0:36:29,392
Arghh! What?!


629
0:36:29,392 --> 0:36:31,432
Have you heard from Libby?


630
0:36:31,432 --> 0:36:33,472
I'm the last one she'd
get in touch with!


631
0:36:33,472 --> 0:36:34,313
Where is she?


632
0:36:34,313 --> 0:36:39,312
I don't know!


633
0:36:39,312 --> 0:36:44,192
Why are you so intent
on seeing her anyway?


634
0:36:44,192 --> 0:36:46,151
She didn't say
where she was going,


635
0:36:46,151 --> 0:36:47,273
or who she was going with?


636
0:36:47,273 --> 0:36:49,712
Why would she tell me?


637
0:36:49,712 --> 0:36:52,272
She didn't leave a note for me?


638
0:36:52,272 --> 0:36:53,872
What, for her jailer?


639
0:36:53,872 --> 0:36:55,592
Her tormentor?


640
0:36:55,592 --> 0:36:56,992
I'm her mother.


641
0:36:56,992 --> 0:36:59,72
Just because you've seen the light,


642
0:36:59,72 --> 0:37:13,552
doesn't mean to say
everyone else has too.


643
0:37:13,552 --> 0:37:15,992
Go seek comfort in Jesus.


644
0:37:15,992 --> 0:37:17,712
Not the real one, obviously.


645
0:37:17,712 --> 0:37:19,952
I'm not suggesting you should
top yourself,


646
0:37:19,952 --> 0:37:24,112
but, you know, the himbo on the bus.


647
0:37:24,112 --> 0:37:29,72
I'm sure he can rustle up
a few words of comfort


648
0:37:29,72 --> 0:37:30,672
from some Epistle or another.


649
0:37:30,672 --> 0:37:41,672
You know, rattle his tambourine.


650
0:37:41,672 --> 0:37:43,72
Fuck me.


651
0:37:43,72 --> 0:38:13,152
The ice maiden melteth.


652
0:38:13,152 --> 0:38:15,72
I shed a few tears for her.


653
0:38:15,72 --> 0:38:16,353
Mostly of regret.


654
0:38:16,353 --> 0:38:19,192
You treated her like shite.


655
0:38:19,192 --> 0:38:21,472
Regret that I ever met her,


656
0:38:21,472 --> 0:38:24,392
that we ever picked up where
we left off,


657
0:38:24,392 --> 0:38:27,672
cos truth be told, there was nothing
left to pick up.


658
0:38:27,672 --> 0:38:30,472
But, I got me tea made.
Me washing done...


659
0:38:30,472 --> 0:38:32,112
A good nosh now and again.


660
0:38:32,112 --> 0:38:35,112
You bastard!


661
0:38:35,112 --> 0:38:39,152
All she needed to hear was, "I love
you", and she was on her knees.


662
0:38:39,152 --> 0:38:45,112
I've had better sex but my
shirts have never been whiter.


663
0:38:45,112 --> 0:38:49,352
I wondered when the real Patty
would resurface.


664
0:38:49,352 --> 0:38:59,552
And here she is.


665
0:38:59,552 --> 0:39:4,712
So, this is goodbye then, is it?


666
0:39:4,712 --> 0:39:6,672
I can't see any reason to stay.


667
0:39:6,672 --> 0:39:8,593
Where did you go when you left here?


668
0:39:8,593 --> 0:39:11,272
What turned you from the godless
old crone we knew


669
0:39:11,272 --> 0:39:14,512
into the God-fearing crone
now before us?


670
0:39:14,512 --> 0:39:17,472
Much like yourself,
I lived a selfish life,


671
0:39:17,472 --> 0:39:22,152
attending to my needs before even
considering the needs of others.


672
0:39:22,152 --> 0:39:25,872
And then I went back to Ireland
and, while there,


673
0:39:25,872 --> 0:39:31,512
had what I can only describe
as my Road To Damascus experience.


674
0:39:31,512 --> 0:39:35,72
Oh, so God just popped up and
showed you the error of your ways?


675
0:39:35,72 --> 0:39:37,112
Yeah? Well, I don't believe a word.


676
0:39:37,112 --> 0:39:40,392
I think little Patty clocked
the Jesus freaks and thought,


677
0:39:40,392 --> 0:39:44,312
"Bingo! Free meals and a roof over
me head for the rest of me life."


678
0:39:44,312 --> 0:39:46,752
I wouldn't expect you to believe.


679
0:39:46,752 --> 0:39:50,312
I was a lost sheep and God saved me.


680
0:39:50,312 --> 0:39:51,872
Liar.


681
0:39:51,872 --> 0:39:55,632
May He strike me down here and now


682
0:39:55,632 --> 0:40:53,792
if I tell a word of a lie.


683
0:40:53,792 --> 0:40:55,272
Matty?


684
0:40:55,272 --> 0:40:56,352
I'm going.


685
0:40:56,352 --> 0:40:57,392
Good.


686
0:40:57,392 --> 0:40:59,312
No. I mean, I'm leaving this.


687
0:40:59,312 --> 0:41:1,872
You don't have to leave this.
Just here.


688
0:41:1,872 --> 0:41:4,512
My head's full of everything
I've been missing.


689
0:41:4,512 --> 0:41:7,352
You can have it all, you know.
I think God would let you.


690
0:41:7,352 --> 0:41:10,792
How can I preach purity
when all I want to be is impure?


691
0:41:10,792 --> 0:41:14,672
Preach goodness,
when all I want to do is bad?


692
0:41:14,672 --> 0:41:20,352
I'm not worthy.
They deserve better than me.


693
0:41:20,352 --> 0:41:23,192
What you want to do, it's normal.


694
0:41:23,192 --> 0:41:24,552
It's not bad.


695
0:41:24,552 --> 0:41:26,552
But I want it to be bad.


696
0:41:26,552 --> 0:41:35,432
I want to bite the apple, Kelly.


697
0:41:35,432 --> 0:42:14,552
Thank you.


698
0:42:14,552 --> 0:42:15,832
Anyone?


699
0:42:15,832 --> 0:42:33,552
Nothing.


700
0:42:33,552 --> 0:42:35,912
See you got my present, then?


701
0:42:35,912 --> 0:42:37,33
I won't ask where it came from.


702
0:42:37,33 --> 0:42:38,232
'No, don't.'


703
0:42:38,232 --> 0:42:39,313
You got my present?


704
0:42:39,313 --> 0:42:41,992
I got it.


705
0:42:41,992 --> 0:42:46,752
Listen, next time you're saving
souls round here, come save mine.


706
0:42:46,752 --> 0:42:52,432
Bye.


707
0:42:52,432 --> 0:42:55,832
They say the damage to my spine
is irreparable.


708
0:42:55,832 --> 0:42:57,232
I'll never walk again.


709
0:42:57,232 --> 0:42:59,792
You've taken it very well,
I'll give you that.


710
0:42:59,792 --> 0:43:1,352
I've got my life back, Frank.


711
0:43:1,352 --> 0:43:2,832
What could be better?


712
0:43:2,832 --> 0:43:4,512
I don't understand.


713
0:43:4,512 --> 0:43:6,592
The police will be here any minute.


714
0:43:6,592 --> 0:43:10,232
And what I tell them
depends very much on you.


715
0:43:10,232 --> 0:43:12,352
How do you mean?


716
0:43:12,352 --> 0:43:15,672
Everyone on the estate
knows how much you hated me.


717
0:43:15,672 --> 0:43:20,192
Everyone knows how much you
wanted me out the picture.


718
0:43:20,192 --> 0:43:23,552
If you agree to have me move back,


719
0:43:23,552 --> 0:43:25,912
then I agree not to tell the police


720
0:43:25,912 --> 0:43:28,912
you pushed me down the stairs -
that you did this.


721
0:43:28,912 --> 0:43:31,792
Well, that's just gonna be my word
against... Who's gonna believe..?


722
0:43:31,792 --> 0:43:33,832
Ah! Oh, nurse!


723
0:43:33,832 --> 0:43:35,272
Oh! Nurse!


724
0:43:35,272 --> 0:43:36,792
Pain, oh!


725
0:43:36,792 --> 0:43:38,272
Oh!


726
0:43:38,272 --> 0:43:40,233
We'll have to increase
your morphine.


727
0:43:40,233 --> 0:43:43,272
I'm just going to check with
the doctor. Hang on there, Patty.


728
0:43:43,272 --> 0:43:50,592
Oh! Oh!


729
0:43:50,592 --> 0:43:53,512
Wouldn't you be better off
back on the bus,


730
0:43:53,512 --> 0:43:55,632
amongst your own kind?


731
0:43:55,632 --> 0:43:59,632
With those Bible bashing bastards?
I can't stand the feckin' sight
of them!


732
0:43:59,632 --> 0:44:1,552
I want to be amongst folk I know.


733
0:44:1,552 --> 0:44:4,312
Familiar faces, surroundings.


734
0:44:4,312 --> 0:44:5,992
I want to come home.


735
0:44:5,992 --> 0:44:24,712
And I wanted to make your life
a feckin' misery, Frank.


736
0:44:24,712 --> 0:44:28,272
'I ran into that old boyfriend
a few years ago.


737
0:44:28,272 --> 0:44:30,32
'I was out with the girls in town,


738
0:44:30,32 --> 0:44:32,632
'turned a corner and bang,
there he was.


739
0:44:32,632 --> 0:44:36,232
'No longer a possible
replacement for Robbie or Gary.


740
0:44:36,232 --> 0:44:38,713
'His face was etched with all
the wrong he'd done.


741
0:44:38,713 --> 0:44:40,272
'All the pain he'd caused.'


742
0:44:40,272 --> 0:44:41,273
Oh, they're here!


743
0:44:41,273 --> 0:44:43,352
'And, if I believed in God,


744
0:44:43,352 --> 0:44:47,592
'I'd like to think he'd had every
sin that he'd ever committed


745
0:44:47,592 --> 0:44:51,552
'scratched into his face
as a warning to others


746
0:44:51,552 --> 0:44:59,72
'to keep their distance - to beware.


747
0:44:59,72 --> 0:45:1,672
'That's if I believed in God.'


748
0:45:1,672 --> 0:45:4,432
What are you going on about?
It's a scratch card!


749
0:45:4,432 --> 0:45:7,432
(REPORTER)
Tonight, a pensioner was brutally assaulted


750
0:45:7,432 --> 0:45:9,192
in her home in Belvedere Road...


751
0:45:9,192 --> 0:45:13,672
If it gets any clearer,

0:45:13,672 --> 0:45:15,113
It's Frank's name on the line.


753
0:45:15,113 --> 0:45:18,312
Yeah, and his head.


754
0:45:18,312 --> 0:45:20,312
Don't know how you missed him!


755
0:45:20,312 --> 0:45:21,392
What the fuck?

0:45:25,192 --> 0:45:26,632

I need Kev! Where is he?
