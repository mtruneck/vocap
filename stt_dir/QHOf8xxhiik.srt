1
0:0:3,438 --> 0:0:6,15
OK, you guys are ready?


2
0:0:6,15 --> 0:0:7,531
Nick, what is this about?


3
0:0:7,531 --> 0:0:9,667
I just wanted to capture
your first reactions


4
0:0:9,667 --> 0:0:11,135
When I tell you this news.


5
0:0:11,135 --> 0:0:12,336
Okay.


6
0:0:12,336 --> 0:0:14,705
You guys know thunder Clark
from the station, right?


7
0:0:14,705 --> 0:0:15,773
- The weatherman?


8
0:0:15,773 --> 0:0:17,741
- No, thunder Clark the plumber.


9
0:0:17,741 --> 0:0:19,11
- Okay, what about him?


10
0:0:19,11 --> 0:0:21,645
- Well, as one of the top
personalities at the station,


11
0:0:21,645 --> 0:0:24,348
He was invited to play
in a celebrity golf tournament.


12
0:0:24,348 --> 0:0:26,717
- Good for him.


13
0:0:26,717 --> 0:0:27,885
- Well, not exactly.


14
0:0:27,885 --> 0:0:29,386
It turns out thunder came down


15
0:0:29,386 --> 0:0:31,122
With a really bad case
of pinkeye,


16
0:0:31,122 --> 0:0:32,323
And it's highly contagious,


17
0:0:32,323 --> 0:0:34,191
So they don't want him to play.


18
0:0:34,191 --> 0:0:35,659
So since thunder is sick,


19
0:0:35,659 --> 0:0:38,562
The station manager asked me
to step up and take his place.


20
0:0:38,562 --> 0:0:41,332
- Babe...


21
0:0:41,332 --> 0:0:43,501
You can't play golf.


22
0:0:43,501 --> 0:0:45,236
- That <i>is</i> a surprise.


23
0:0:45,236 --> 0:0:47,4
- No, that's not the surprise.


24
0:0:47,4 --> 0:0:48,205
- Well, honey, can you hurry up


25
0:0:48,205 --> 0:0:49,54
And tell us
what the surprise is?


26
0:0:49,54 --> 0:0:51,442
- Fine,
I've been picked to play


27
0:0:51,442 --> 0:0:52,743
In a celebrity golf tournament,


28
0:0:52,743 --> 0:0:54,545
And we've all been invited.


29
0:0:54,545 --> 0:0:56,68
- To see you play something
you don't know how to play?


30
0:0:56,68 --> 0:0:58,749
- It's a lot like
my third grade band concert.


31
0:0:58,749 --> 0:0:59,95
- Oh, yeah.


32
0:0:59,95 --> 0:1:1,118
- Ow, now, see, Kevin,


33
0:1:1,118 --> 0:1:3,354
Your trumpet solo
for <i>all about the Benjamins,</i>


34
0:1:3,354 --> 0:1:5,422
That was...Amazing.


35
0:1:5,422 --> 0:1:7,391
- Then where's the tape, mom?


36
0:1:7,391 --> 0:1:9,66
- I lost it.


37
0:1:9,66 --> 0:1:10,928
- I'm proud of you, dad,


38
0:1:10,928 --> 0:1:12,496
Even if you can't play golf.


39
0:1:12,496 --> 0:1:14,598
So where's the tournament?


40
0:1:14,598 --> 0:1:18,636
- At Walt Disney world.


41
0:1:18,636 --> 0:1:20,804
We're going to Disney world!


42
0:1:20,804 --> 0:1:22,339
- We're going to Disney world?


43
0:1:22,339 --> 0:1:23,374
- Yes!


44
0:1:23,374 --> 0:1:24,508
- In Orlando?


45
0:1:24,508 --> 0:1:25,576
- Yes!


46
0:1:25,576 --> 0:1:26,944
- <i>Walt</i> Disney world?


47
0:1:26,944 --> 0:1:29,18
- Yes, we're going
to Walt Disney world


48
0:1:29,18 --> 0:1:30,648
In Orlando, Florida!


49
0:1:30,648 --> 0:1:31,916
Oh, my God!


50
0:1:31,916 --> 0:1:33,317
- We're going to Disney world!


51
0:1:33,317 --> 0:1:34,451
- Whoo!


52
0:1:34,451 --> 0:1:36,53
- I don't know what you guys
are gonna do,


53
0:1:36,53 --> 0:1:37,688
But I'm gonna see
the hall of presidents.


54
0:1:37,688 --> 0:1:38,923
I heard they added Obama.


55
0:1:38,923 --> 0:1:40,925
I voted for you, man!


56
0:1:40,925 --> 0:1:43,827
- Oh, honey, that is amazing.


57
0:1:43,827 --> 0:1:45,196
So unbelievable.


58
0:1:45,196 --> 0:1:48,332
This'll be, like, our first
official family vacation.


59
0:1:48,332 --> 0:1:50,734
- Oh, this is going to be great.


60
0:1:50,734 --> 0:1:52,36
- So when do we get to go?


61
0:1:52,36 --> 0:1:54,605
- This weekend!


62
0:1:54,605 --> 0:1:56,473
- As in this weekend?


63
0:1:56,473 --> 0:1:57,441
- Yes!


64
0:1:57,441 --> 0:2:0,77
- No.


65
0:2:0,77 --> 0:2:3,714
- You might not want
to film this part.


66
0:2:3,714 --> 0:2:5,382
- Okay, well,
remember when I told you


67
0:2:5,382 --> 0:2:9,119
That my firm asked me
to plan this corporate retreat?


68
0:2:9,119 --> 0:2:11,822
- Yeah, big account, huge.


69
0:2:11,822 --> 0:2:14,258
- I'm supposed to give
the perfect presentation


70
0:2:14,258 --> 0:2:17,461
At a big breakfast
this Saturday.


71
0:2:17,461 --> 0:2:18,896
- Which means what?


72
0:2:18,896 --> 0:2:20,664
- I can't go.


73
0:2:20,664 --> 0:2:22,299
- Oh, that's... that's bad.


74
0:2:22,299 --> 0:2:23,434
Hey, dad, can we still go?


75
0:2:23,434 --> 0:2:25,2
- Yeah, please?


76
0:2:25,2 --> 0:2:34,712
Can we?


77
0:2:34,712 --> 0:2:38,649
sync and correct by dr.jackson
www.addic7ed.com


78
0:2:38,649 --> 0:2:40,618
- Oh, baby.


79
0:2:40,618 --> 0:2:43,32
Can't you let somebody else
take this one?


80
0:2:43,32 --> 0:2:44,989
Look, it's not
your first big client,


81
0:2:44,989 --> 0:2:46,624
And it won't be your last.


82
0:2:46,624 --> 0:2:48,993
- I know, but Gigi and I
brought them on.


83
0:2:48,993 --> 0:2:51,462
If I bail now,
it'll just look bad.


84
0:2:51,462 --> 0:2:52,863
- Look at that.


85
0:2:52,863 --> 0:2:56,533
I was just planning on doing
something really special for us,


86
0:2:56,533 --> 0:2:58,669
You know, riding some rides,


87
0:2:58,669 --> 0:3:0,371
Catching the fireworks,


88
0:3:0,371 --> 0:3:1,672
A little romance,


89
0:3:1,672 --> 0:3:3,607
Family stuff.


90
0:3:3,607 --> 0:3:6,71
See, you can't miss that.


91
0:3:6,71 --> 0:3:12,149
- Nick, honey, I don't want to,
but I have to.


92
0:3:12,149 --> 0:3:13,651
- Fine.


93
0:3:13,651 --> 0:3:15,319
I'll tell the kids we can't go.


94
0:3:15,319 --> 0:3:17,454
- No, no, no, no.
Don't do that.


95
0:3:17,454 --> 0:3:19,39
You know, maybe Kevin
had the right idea.


96
0:3:19,39 --> 0:3:21,158
Just because I can't go


97
0:3:21,158 --> 0:3:22,593
Doesn't mean
that you guys can't.


98
0:3:22,593 --> 0:3:23,661
This is too important.


99
0:3:23,661 --> 0:3:27,31
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.


100
0:3:27,31 --> 0:3:28,265
- Thank you, baby.


101
0:3:28,265 --> 0:3:29,9
- You better go now,


102
0:3:29,9 --> 0:3:31,368
Because once they see you
play golf,


103
0:3:31,368 --> 0:3:33,971
You'll never be invited
to another tournament again.


104
0:3:33,971 --> 0:3:37,541
- I love you too, baby.


105
0:3:37,541 --> 0:3:39,176
Are you sure?


106
0:3:39,176 --> 0:3:40,644
- Yes.


107
0:3:40,644 --> 0:3:46,317
- Okay, then.


108
0:3:46,317 --> 0:3:47,484
We're going to Disney world.


109
0:3:47,484 --> 0:3:48,585
Yes!


110
0:3:48,585 --> 0:3:57,761
- Going to Disney!
Going to Disney!


111
0:3:57,761 --> 0:3:58,862
- Ooh, ooh, let me get that.


112
0:3:58,862 --> 0:4:0,164
Let me get that.


113
0:4:0,164 --> 0:4:2,399
Kevin, did you pack
extra underwear?


114
0:4:2,399 --> 0:4:4,435
- Define "extra."


115
0:4:4,435 --> 0:4:6,37
- Boy, you are not gonna be
in Orlando


116
0:4:6,37 --> 0:4:7,404
Flipping your drawers.


117
0:4:7,404 --> 0:4:11,642
Now, four pairs, go.


118
0:4:11,642 --> 0:4:13,911
- We're going to Disney world!


119
0:4:13,911 --> 0:4:17,548
- Okay, please tell me
you just bought that.


120
0:4:17,548 --> 0:4:18,549
- No, no, no, no.


121
0:4:18,549 --> 0:4:20,317
I am very proud of my ears.


122
0:4:20,317 --> 0:4:24,188
Disney reminds me
of what being good is all about.


123
0:4:24,188 --> 0:4:26,23
- He's coming to caddy for me.


124
0:4:26,23 --> 0:4:27,958
- Yeah, and to get some items
signed for the store.


125
0:4:27,958 --> 0:4:30,16
If I can get my 9-iron signed
by Anthony Anderson,


126
0:4:30,16 --> 0:4:32,563
My trip will be complete.


127
0:4:32,563 --> 0:4:36,667
- Well, my trip will be complete
when we get back.


128
0:4:36,667 --> 0:4:38,135
- You're gonna have
a good time.


129
0:4:38,135 --> 0:4:40,3
It's the happiest place
on earth.


130
0:4:40,3 --> 0:4:41,105
- Dah-ah-ah-ah.


131
0:4:41,105 --> 0:4:43,273
Disneyland
is the happiest place on earth.


132
0:4:43,273 --> 0:4:46,43
Disney world
is the most magical.


133
0:4:46,43 --> 0:4:47,44
- See, ma?


134
0:4:47,44 --> 0:4:48,178
It's magical!


135
0:4:48,178 --> 0:4:50,614
- Yippee.


136
0:4:50,614 --> 0:4:52,116
- I'm just happy
you're coming along


137
0:4:52,116 --> 0:4:53,484
To help out with the kids.


138
0:4:53,484 --> 0:4:54,518
- I almost forgot,


139
0:4:54,518 --> 0:4:55,986
I have something for you guys.


140
0:4:55,986 --> 0:4:57,488
- Ooh.


141
0:4:57,488 --> 0:4:59,923
- Video cameras,
to capture the memories.


142
0:4:59,923 --> 0:5:2,393
- Oh, thanks.
- There you go.


143
0:5:2,393 --> 0:5:3,794
- Four pairs of underwear.


144
0:5:3,794 --> 0:5:8,399
- Are they clean?


145
0:5:8,399 --> 0:5:9,633
- All I know,


146
0:5:9,633 --> 0:5:11,702
As soon as Kevin comes back
with clean underwear...


147
0:5:11,702 --> 0:5:13,237
We're going to Disney world!


148
0:5:13,237 --> 0:5:20,411
- Yeah!


149
0:5:20,411 --> 0:5:21,945
- Oh, my God, Gigi.
- Hey!


150
0:5:21,945 --> 0:5:23,313
I'm having a bad day.


151
0:5:23,313 --> 0:5:24,882
I'm get all of this
fixed later.


152
0:5:24,882 --> 0:5:26,16
But for now,


153
0:5:26,16 --> 0:5:28,18
Let's just say I look fine,


154
0:5:28,18 --> 0:5:29,953
Unless you want to spend
the next two hours


155
0:5:29,953 --> 0:5:31,455
Talking about it.


156
0:5:31,455 --> 0:5:32,79
- Okay.


157
0:5:32,79 --> 0:5:34,825
So here are the bullet points


158
0:5:34,825 --> 0:5:37,127
Of what the client wants
for the retreat.


159
0:5:37,127 --> 0:5:38,996
They want to get out
of the pacific northwest,


160
0:5:38,996 --> 0:5:40,23
Someplace sunny.


161
0:5:40,23 --> 0:5:43,567
They want a location that has
enough meeting amenities


162
0:5:43,567 --> 0:5:45,602
But also numerous
fun activities


163
0:5:45,602 --> 0:5:47,271
To enjoy
after business is over.


164
0:5:47,271 --> 0:5:49,907
- That sounds more
like a vacation.


165
0:5:49,907 --> 0:5:51,108
- Don't remind me.


166
0:5:51,108 --> 0:5:52,943
I'm supposed to be
in Disney world right now.


167
0:5:52,943 --> 0:5:54,378
- Oh, I'm sorry.


168
0:5:54,378 --> 0:5:56,413
Too bad you can't
have the retreat there.


169
0:5:56,413 --> 0:5:59,116
- Wait a minute.


170
0:5:59,116 --> 0:6:1,18
That's it.


171
0:6:1,18 --> 0:6:3,86
The client wants someplace


172
0:6:3,86 --> 0:6:6,56
That combines meeting space
and resort activities,


173
0:6:6,56 --> 0:6:7,458
Someplace sunny.


174
0:6:7,458 --> 0:6:8,592
Don't you get it?


175
0:6:8,592 --> 0:6:10,36
- You want to have the retreat
in Dubai?


176
0:6:10,36 --> 0:6:12,529
- No, Disney world!


177
0:6:12,529 --> 0:6:13,597
It's perfect!


178
0:6:13,597 --> 0:6:15,299
- It is?
- Yes.


179
0:6:15,299 --> 0:6:17,267
I'm gonna call Nick and tell him
we are on our way.


180
0:6:17,267 --> 0:6:18,936
- Can I say it?


181
0:6:18,936 --> 0:6:20,471
- Go ahead.


182
0:6:20,471 --> 0:6:22,139
- We're going to Disney world!


183
0:6:22,139 --> 0:6:28,466
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!


184
0:6:28,466 --> 0:6:30,568
- Hey, babe, we made it.


185
0:6:30,568 --> 0:6:32,403
Mom and the kids
are going to the parks,


186
0:6:32,403 --> 0:6:34,405
And I'm going to check in
for the golf tournament.


187
0:6:34,405 --> 0:6:37,108
We miss you.


188
0:6:37,108 --> 0:6:38,142
- Can we go now?


189
0:6:38,142 --> 0:6:39,477
I want to ride space Mountain.


190
0:6:39,477 --> 0:6:40,778
- Yeah, and I want
to go swimming


191
0:6:40,778 --> 0:6:41,812
At the typhoon lagoon.


192
0:6:41,812 --> 0:6:43,147
- All right.


193
0:6:43,147 --> 0:6:45,316
I'll meet up with you guys
after the golf tournament.


194
0:6:45,316 --> 0:6:46,35
- I'm coming.


195
0:6:46,35 --> 0:6:47,752
Look, I know this place
is magical,


196
0:6:47,752 --> 0:6:50,421
But walking too fast will cast
an evil spell on my feet.


197
0:6:50,421 --> 0:6:51,889
Come on.
Where we gonna go first?


198
0:6:51,889 --> 0:6:53,691
- We should go swimming.
- Do you have the map?


199
0:6:53,691 --> 0:6:55,76
- Yeah, here's the map.
- Okay, which way are we going?


200
0:6:55,76 --> 0:6:57,929
- Oh, Nick Kingston-persons.


201
0:6:57,929 --> 0:7:0,264
KAWT sports in the house.


202
0:7:0,264 --> 0:7:3,67
- Wow, Anthony Anderson,
you know me?


203
0:7:3,67 --> 0:7:4,101
- Uh, no.


204
0:7:4,101 --> 0:7:7,138
I know you're gonna lose,
though.


205
0:7:7,138 --> 0:7:10,608
Unfortunately for you, brother,
I'm playing.


206
0:7:10,608 --> 0:7:13,177
And although you will love
your time down here at Disney,


207
0:7:13,177 --> 0:7:15,98
Your time on the links
will be dismal.


208
0:7:15,98 --> 0:7:17,448
- Oh.


209
0:7:17,448 --> 0:7:19,483
Okay, well, we'll see.


210
0:7:19,483 --> 0:7:20,651
Who am I playing with?


211
0:7:20,651 --> 0:7:23,654
- Toby.


212
0:7:23,654 --> 0:7:24,722
Al Roker.


213
0:7:24,722 --> 0:7:26,223
- You're teaming with Al Roker.


214
0:7:26,223 --> 0:7:27,625
- Yeah.


215
0:7:27,625 --> 0:7:29,36
- So what are you gonna call
your team?


216
0:7:29,36 --> 0:7:33,664
Team chrome dome?


217
0:7:33,664 --> 0:7:34,732
- Okay, okay.


218
0:7:34,732 --> 0:7:36,33
Get your jokes in now.
Get 'em in.


219
0:7:36,33 --> 0:7:37,368
- Oh, I will.
I will.


220
0:7:37,368 --> 0:7:38,436
- There you go.


221
0:7:38,436 --> 0:7:40,37
- What's that for?


222
0:7:40,37 --> 0:7:42,173
- Oh, I'm gonna send you
this picture after you lose


223
0:7:42,173 --> 0:7:43,941
So you can remember
what it looked like


224
0:7:43,941 --> 0:7:46,11
When you were happy.


225
0:7:46,11 --> 0:7:48,479
Little black smiley face!


226
0:7:48,479 --> 0:7:49,847
- Oh, snap.
Okay.


227
0:7:49,847 --> 0:7:54,919
Nick Kingston-persons
got jokes.


228
0:7:54,919 --> 0:7:56,554
- Nick Kingston-persons.


229
0:7:56,554 --> 0:7:58,889
- What's happening,
my white friend?


230
0:7:58,889 --> 0:8:1,392
Have you been teaching him
how the game is played?


231
0:8:1,392 --> 0:8:3,194
Because I believe
you're gonna need


232
0:8:3,194 --> 0:8:6,23
All the help that you can get.


233
0:8:6,23 --> 0:8:8,32
- Yo mama.


234
0:8:8,32 --> 0:8:10,568
- What'd you just say to me,
my man?


235
0:8:10,568 --> 0:8:11,602
- Martin.


236
0:8:11,602 --> 0:8:12,637
He didn't mean that.


237
0:8:12,637 --> 0:8:14,538
- I don't really do trash talk.


238
0:8:14,538 --> 0:8:16,607
It just kind of popped
into my head.


239
0:8:16,607 --> 0:8:19,343
My apologies, sir.


240
0:8:19,343 --> 0:8:20,778
- Yeah, all right, brother.


241
0:8:20,778 --> 0:8:23,28
I'll see you out there.


242
0:8:23,28 --> 0:8:24,915
Bring your "a" game.


243
0:8:24,915 --> 0:8:26,217
- Brought.


244
0:8:26,217 --> 0:8:30,621
- Loved you in <i>trippin'.</i>


245
0:8:30,621 --> 0:8:32,289
- Voice mail again.


246
0:8:32,289 --> 0:8:33,758
Hi, honey.


247
0:8:33,758 --> 0:8:34,859
It's me.


248
0:8:34,859 --> 0:8:35,993
Guess what.


249
0:8:35,993 --> 0:8:37,528
I'm at Disney world!


250
0:8:37,528 --> 0:8:38,796
- Whoo!


251
0:8:38,796 --> 0:8:41,365
- Can't wait to see you guys.
Love you.


252
0:8:41,365 --> 0:8:42,366
- Okay, first, the spa


253
0:8:42,366 --> 0:8:44,168
And then poolside cocktails.


254
0:8:44,168 --> 0:8:46,203
- No, we have to find Nick,
and then we have a meeting


255
0:8:46,203 --> 0:8:47,938
With the convention director
for the tour.


256
0:8:47,938 --> 0:8:49,173
- Question.
- What?


257
0:8:49,173 --> 0:8:51,575
- Do you really need me
to assist you on the tour?


258
0:8:51,575 --> 0:8:54,345
I mean, it's not like I'm gonna
see something with my own eyes


259
0:8:54,345 --> 0:8:56,447
That you can't see
with your eyes.


260
0:8:56,447 --> 0:8:58,82
- Fine.
- Thank you.


261
0:8:58,82 --> 0:9:0,518
- Go to the spa,
but book something for me.


262
0:9:0,518 --> 0:9:1,686
- Okay, what?
Pedicure.


263
0:9:1,686 --> 0:9:3,32
Saw your toes.
They look a mess. Come on.


264
0:9:3,32 --> 0:9:7,591
- Wait!
That's why I'm wearing boots!


265
0:9:7,591 --> 0:9:10,27
- Wow, big thunder Mountain
was awesome.


266
0:9:10,27 --> 0:9:11,495
- Then why were you crying?


267
0:9:11,495 --> 0:9:13,431
- Those were tears of Joy.


268
0:9:13,431 --> 0:9:15,566
Oh, Marilyn, you missed out
on a great ride.


269
0:9:15,566 --> 0:9:16,667
- No, I didn't.


270
0:9:16,667 --> 0:9:20,571
You missed out
on a great frozen lemonade.


271
0:9:20,571 --> 0:9:21,906
- Oh, look, it's Pluto!


272
0:9:21,906 --> 0:9:23,407
Marilyn, can you take a picture?


273
0:9:23,407 --> 0:9:26,377
- Sure, get together.


274
0:9:26,377 --> 0:9:27,344
Got it.


275
0:9:27,344 --> 0:9:29,547
Nice.


276
0:9:29,547 --> 0:9:35,19
Nah, I'm good.


277
0:9:35,19 --> 0:9:38,522
- That lady made Pluto cry.


278
0:9:38,522 --> 0:9:41,559
- Really?


279
0:9:41,559 --> 0:9:43,461
- Bam!
What do you think?


280
0:9:43,461 --> 0:9:44,929
- Nice,
but you need to figure out


281
0:9:44,929 --> 0:9:46,23
What you're gonna say
to Al Roker


282
0:9:46,23 --> 0:9:48,666
When he finds out
you don't know how to play.


283
0:9:48,666 --> 0:9:50,0
- Here, take a picture.


284
0:9:50,0 --> 0:9:55,339
I want to send it to Suzanne
and ask her what she thinks.


285
0:9:55,339 --> 0:9:56,707
Dick Wolf?


286
0:9:56,707 --> 0:9:58,42
- What?


287
0:9:58,42 --> 0:9:59,376
- I don't know.


288
0:9:59,376 --> 0:10:0,778
- Hello?


289
0:10:0,778 --> 0:10:4,14
Who is this?


290
0:10:4,14 --> 0:10:6,984
Yeah, man.
Whatever you say, man.


291
0:10:6,984 --> 0:10:11,88
No, I do not want to be
on a new <i>law & order.</i>


292
0:10:11,88 --> 0:10:12,823
I really do, huh?


293
0:10:12,823 --> 0:10:15,159
No, I don't.


294
0:10:15,159 --> 0:10:16,994
Who am I?


295
0:10:16,994 --> 0:10:19,43
You want to know
who I am, Dick Wolf?


296
0:10:19,43 --> 0:10:21,632
Well, I'm Rick Fox.


297
0:10:21,632 --> 0:10:22,666
Yeah.


298
0:10:22,666 --> 0:10:23,868
Uh-huh.


299
0:10:23,868 --> 0:10:25,136
Wha... yeah?


300
0:10:25,136 --> 0:10:30,407
Well, your mama.


301
0:10:30,407 --> 0:10:31,976
- Let me.
Let me.


302
0:10:31,976 --> 0:10:34,345
Hello?


303
0:10:34,345 --> 0:10:37,548
Uh, no, this is not
Anthony Anderson.


304
0:10:37,548 --> 0:10:39,65
Who is this?


305
0:10:39,65 --> 0:10:42,253
Dick Wolf from <i>law & order?</i>


306
0:10:42,253 --> 0:10:44,488
No, no, no.


307
0:10:44,488 --> 0:10:45,99
You probably had
the wrong number.


308
0:10:45,99 --> 0:10:47,158
No, Mr. Wolf.


309
0:10:47,158 --> 0:10:49,293
I don't find that funny at all.


310
0:10:49,293 --> 0:10:52,62
I will absolutely tell Anthony
you called.


311
0:10:52,62 --> 0:10:54,131
<i>Law & order.</i>
Absolutely.


312
0:10:54,131 --> 0:10:56,567
Yeah, bye-bye.


313
0:10:56,567 --> 0:10:58,969
- Please don't tell me
that was really Dick Wolf.


314
0:10:58,969 --> 0:11:0,404
- Okay.


315
0:11:0,404 --> 0:11:2,873
- I have Anthony's phone,
don't I?


316
0:11:2,873 --> 0:11:4,74
- I think so.


317
0:11:4,74 --> 0:11:5,81
- I guess we better
go find him.


318
0:11:5,81 --> 0:11:11,182
- Yeah.


319
0:11:11,182 --> 0:11:14,218
- Please, Marilyn?
It'll be fun.


320
0:11:14,218 --> 0:11:15,586
- What don't you all understand


321
0:11:15,586 --> 0:11:18,422
About the phrase
"I don't like rides"?


322
0:11:18,422 --> 0:11:19,623
- Are you scared?


323
0:11:19,623 --> 0:11:21,325
- If I was, I wouldn't be scared
of this one.


324
0:11:21,325 --> 0:11:22,326
It's called dumbo.


325
0:11:22,326 --> 0:11:24,161
Nothing scary about that.


326
0:11:24,161 --> 0:11:27,698
- That's the lady
that made Pluto cry!


327
0:11:27,698 --> 0:11:29,5
- Make you cry next.


328
0:11:29,5 --> 0:11:31,368
- Okay, if there's nothing scary
about the ride,


329
0:11:31,368 --> 0:11:32,736
Then why don't you just
get on it?


330
0:11:32,736 --> 0:11:33,637
- Yeah.


331
0:11:33,637 --> 0:11:35,539
- If I do,
will you leave me alone?


332
0:11:35,539 --> 0:11:37,107
- Deal.


333
0:11:37,107 --> 0:11:38,75
- Come on.
- Yes.


334
0:11:38,75 --> 0:11:44,515
- Back of the line.
Go.


335
0:11:44,515 --> 0:11:48,419
- Um, Marilyn,
are you all right?


336
0:11:48,419 --> 0:11:50,788
- Man, that was incredible!


337
0:11:50,788 --> 0:11:52,323
- Really?
- Yes!


338
0:11:52,323 --> 0:11:54,658
You know, I never got
to come here when I was younger.


339
0:11:54,658 --> 0:11:55,993
And whenever
I would see somebody


340
0:11:55,993 --> 0:11:57,962
In those football games,
I would always say,


341
0:11:57,962 --> 0:12:0,831
"why would a grown man want
to come to Disney world?"


342
0:12:0,831 --> 0:12:3,133
Well, now I see why.


343
0:12:3,133 --> 0:12:5,2
Can we do another one?


344
0:12:5,2 --> 0:12:6,67
- Sure.


345
0:12:6,67 --> 0:12:10,841
- Then let's go!


346
0:12:10,841 --> 0:12:12,476
- You know, I left a message
for Anthony Anderson


347
0:12:12,476 --> 0:12:14,111
On his phone and at his room.


348
0:12:14,111 --> 0:12:17,147
- Well, you can tell him
in person, 'cause there he is.


349
0:12:17,147 --> 0:12:20,784
- Oh, hey,
what's up, Bagger Vance?


350
0:12:20,784 --> 0:12:21,986
- Don't say it.


351
0:12:21,986 --> 0:12:24,321
- For the record,
Bagger Vance was black.


352
0:12:24,321 --> 0:12:25,489
- Remix.


353
0:12:25,489 --> 0:12:28,659
Uh, ving rhames,
I think I have your phone.


354
0:12:28,659 --> 0:12:30,694
- Yeah, and I think
I have yours.


355
0:12:30,694 --> 0:12:32,663
- Oh, okay.
- Did I get any calls?


356
0:12:32,663 --> 0:12:34,598
- Yeah, some girl named Susan
or Suzy called.


357
0:12:34,598 --> 0:12:36,66
- Suzanne, my wife.


358
0:12:36,66 --> 0:12:37,167
- Yeah, something like that.


359
0:12:37,167 --> 0:12:38,936
did I get any calls?


360
0:12:38,936 --> 0:12:40,671
- No, no.
I didn't even hear it ring.


361
0:12:40,671 --> 0:12:42,339
Did you, Martin?
- Did not hear a thing.


362
0:12:42,339 --> 0:12:44,8
- Oh, okay, cool.


363
0:12:44,8 --> 0:12:45,976
Oh, I also beat your high score
in brick breaker.


364
0:12:45,976 --> 0:12:48,245
Just a little prelim
before the main event.


365
0:12:48,245 --> 0:12:49,446
- Oh, Anthony, um...


366
0:12:49,446 --> 0:12:51,715
You know,
now that I think of it,


367
0:12:51,715 --> 0:12:53,5
You did get a call.


368
0:12:53,5 --> 0:12:54,251
- Oh, from who?


369
0:12:54,251 --> 0:12:55,686
- Your mama!


370
0:12:55,686 --> 0:12:56,954
- Oh, yeah.


371
0:12:56,954 --> 0:12:57,988
Good.


372
0:12:57,988 --> 0:12:59,256
- Cute.


373
0:12:59,256 --> 0:13:2,26
Just like your outfits.


374
0:13:2,26 --> 0:13:4,261
- Mr. Kingston-persons?


375
0:13:4,261 --> 0:13:5,229
- Yes?


376
0:13:5,229 --> 0:13:6,297
- I am sorry to tell you,


377
0:13:6,297 --> 0:13:7,798
But Al Roker's flight
was canceled.


378
0:13:7,798 --> 0:13:9,166
He won't be able to play.


379
0:13:9,166 --> 0:13:11,235
I'm afraid we have to take you
out of the competition.


380
0:13:11,235 --> 0:13:12,536
- No, whoa, whoa.


381
0:13:12,536 --> 0:13:14,672
- So who's playing
against Anthony Anderson now?


382
0:13:14,672 --> 0:13:16,44
- Ha!
Your mama!


383
0:13:16,44 --> 0:13:22,854
Bam!


384
0:13:22,854 --> 0:13:24,356
- Hey!
- Hi.


385
0:13:24,356 --> 0:13:25,991
This place is amazing.


386
0:13:25,991 --> 0:13:27,125
- Ahh.


387
0:13:27,125 --> 0:13:28,226
- This location is perfect.


388
0:13:28,226 --> 0:13:29,528
The client is going to love it.


389
0:13:29,528 --> 0:13:31,196
- Oh, girl, I know I love it.


390
0:13:31,196 --> 0:13:32,33
Have you heard from Nick?


391
0:13:32,33 --> 0:13:33,331
- No, and it's weird,


392
0:13:33,331 --> 0:13:34,533
Because I tried him earlier,


393
0:13:34,533 --> 0:13:36,101
And I got the wrong number.


394
0:13:36,101 --> 0:13:37,135
- With speed dial?


395
0:13:37,135 --> 0:13:38,503
How is that even possible?


396
0:13:38,503 --> 0:13:39,471
- I don't know.


397
0:13:39,471 --> 0:13:40,639
I'm gonna try Lindsey now.


398
0:13:40,639 --> 0:13:41,673
Oh, no.


399
0:13:41,673 --> 0:13:42,674
- What now?


400
0:13:42,674 --> 0:13:44,676
- My phone is dead.
Can I use yours?


401
0:13:44,676 --> 0:13:46,645
- Of course you can,
but it's in my room charging.


402
0:13:46,645 --> 0:13:47,646
- Oh.


403
0:13:47,646 --> 0:13:49,347
- Coconut punch?


404
0:13:49,347 --> 0:13:50,515
- Ooh, yes.


405
0:13:50,515 --> 0:13:51,883
- Look at Mickey on the cup.


406
0:13:51,883 --> 0:13:52,884
That's my drink.


407
0:13:52,884 --> 0:13:57,55
- Mm-Hmm.
- Why are you drinking it?


408
0:13:57,55 --> 0:13:59,624
- Oh, Nick.


409
0:13:59,624 --> 0:14:1,726
Man, I'm sorry you got scratched
from the tournament.


410
0:14:1,726 --> 0:14:3,128
You know,
I was gonna really enjoy


411
0:14:3,128 --> 0:14:4,763
Beating you like a bongo.


412
0:14:4,763 --> 0:14:7,566
- Why are you still
talking trash, man?


413
0:14:7,566 --> 0:14:9,334
We are not playing each other.


414
0:14:9,334 --> 0:14:10,635
It's over.


415
0:14:10,635 --> 0:14:11,77
You ought to be happy.


416
0:14:11,77 --> 0:14:14,94
At least this way,
you can keep on dreaming.


417
0:14:14,94 --> 0:14:16,808
- You really think
you could beat me?


418
0:14:16,808 --> 0:14:19,811
- Like eggs on Sunday morning.


419
0:14:19,811 --> 0:14:21,846
- Well, tomorrow
let's arrange something


420
0:14:21,846 --> 0:14:23,114
To settle this, then.


421
0:14:23,114 --> 0:14:24,616
- Arrange it, then.


422
0:14:24,616 --> 0:14:25,784
- It's done.


423
0:14:25,784 --> 0:14:27,819
- Oh, and bring
your big fat mama.


424
0:14:27,819 --> 0:14:28,787
- Bring yours.


425
0:14:28,787 --> 0:14:33,58
I'll bring her gravy bowl.


426
0:14:33,58 --> 0:14:33,992
- Wait.


427
0:14:33,992 --> 0:14:35,56
So were you just
insulting each other,


428
0:14:35,56 --> 0:14:37,429
Or are you actually
bringing your mothers?


429
0:14:37,429 --> 0:14:41,199
- Both.


430
0:14:41,199 --> 0:14:42,634
- So what do you guys
want to do now?


431
0:14:42,634 --> 0:14:43,802
- Can we take a break?


432
0:14:43,802 --> 0:14:45,136
- A break?


433
0:14:45,136 --> 0:14:46,438
I'm having the time of my life,


434
0:14:46,438 --> 0:14:47,639
And you want to take a break?


435
0:14:47,639 --> 0:14:48,873
- Our feet hurt.


436
0:14:48,873 --> 0:14:51,242
- Oh, who's the grandma now?


437
0:14:51,242 --> 0:14:52,611
Oh, fine, we'll stand here.


438
0:14:52,611 --> 0:14:54,779
We'll watch the party
and catch our breath.


439
0:14:54,779 --> 0:14:56,481
Ooh, look! Look!


440
0:14:56,481 --> 0:14:59,384
Aha!


441
0:14:59,384 --> 0:15:0,719
- I don't even know
where to look.


442
0:15:0,719 --> 0:15:1,753
- Me neither.


443
0:15:1,753 --> 0:15:6,257
- Said the parade, right?
- Yeah.


444
0:15:6,257 --> 0:15:8,827
- Gigi, I'm never
gonna find them out here.


445
0:15:8,827 --> 0:15:10,28
- Don't worry.
They'll show up.


446
0:15:10,28 --> 0:15:11,763
Enjoy the parade.
Look!


447
0:15:11,763 --> 0:15:16,568
Look!
Oh, look!


448
0:15:16,568 --> 0:15:18,103
- That was great, everybody.


449
0:15:18,103 --> 0:15:21,6
But now it's time
to take it to the street


450
0:15:21,6 --> 0:15:22,707
And get ready
to move it to the beat,


451
0:15:22,707 --> 0:15:25,176
To our move-it, shake-it,
celebrate-it street party.


452
0:15:25,176 --> 0:15:26,611
So everybody get out
in the street


453
0:15:26,611 --> 0:15:27,679
And get ready to move!


454
0:15:27,679 --> 0:15:29,18
- Ah!
Nick!


455
0:15:29,18 --> 0:15:31,249
Nick!
Nick!


456
0:15:31,249 --> 0:15:33,385
- Uh, buddy...


457
0:15:33,385 --> 0:15:34,753
Do you know that woman?


458
0:15:34,753 --> 0:15:36,521
- Who?
- Right there.


459
0:15:36,521 --> 0:15:39,257
- Nick!
- I told you!


460
0:15:39,257 --> 0:15:44,829
- Suzanne!


461
0:15:44,829 --> 0:15:45,797
Suzanne!


462
0:15:45,797 --> 0:15:48,266
Oh-ho-ho!
Baby!


463
0:15:48,266 --> 0:15:49,668
What are you doing here?


464
0:15:49,668 --> 0:15:52,671
- Honey, I've been trying
to find you guys all day.


465
0:15:52,671 --> 0:15:58,343
Where are the kids?


466
0:15:58,343 --> 0:15:59,678
Mom! Dad!


467
0:15:59,678 --> 0:16:2,747
- Ah!
Oh, my God!


468
0:16:2,747 --> 0:16:3,782
- Excuse me.


469
0:16:3,782 --> 0:16:4,716
- Excuse us!


470
0:16:4,716 --> 0:16:6,785
- Excuse me!
Excuse me!


471
0:16:6,785 --> 0:16:10,121
Ohh, yeah!


472
0:16:10,121 --> 0:16:12,39
- Hi!


473
0:16:12,39 --> 0:16:13,391
- Come here.
Come here.


474
0:16:13,391 --> 0:16:14,426
Come on up.
Come on up.


475
0:16:14,426 --> 0:16:17,162
There you go.
Come on up.


476
0:16:17,162 --> 0:16:18,63
There we go.


477
0:16:18,63 --> 0:16:19,597
- I'm in love.


478
0:16:19,597 --> 0:16:21,199
- Hi, there!


479
0:16:21,199 --> 0:16:26,838
- Go, Mickey!


480
0:16:26,838 --> 0:16:33,478
Go, Mickey!
Go, Mickey!


481
0:16:33,478 --> 0:16:36,748
- So, Nick, you ready for this?


482
0:16:36,748 --> 0:16:40,285
- I was born ready.


483
0:16:40,285 --> 0:16:41,219
- You can take him, honey.


484
0:16:41,219 --> 0:16:42,954
- Yeah, dad, you can do this.


485
0:16:42,954 --> 0:16:45,256
- I see you brought your mama


486
0:16:45,256 --> 0:16:47,158
And your little cheering squad.


487
0:16:47,158 --> 0:16:48,393
Let me tell you something.


488
0:16:48,393 --> 0:16:52,163
This is my course.


489
0:16:52,163 --> 0:16:53,698
- Yeah, just keep talking,
little man.


490
0:16:53,698 --> 0:16:56,735
I just hope you can play golf
better than you can act.


491
0:16:56,735 --> 0:16:57,769
- Ooh.


492
0:16:57,769 --> 0:16:59,804
- And I hope your son
can play golf


493
0:16:59,804 --> 0:17:2,34
Better than whatever it is
that he does,


494
0:17:2,34 --> 0:17:6,478
Which I know nothing about,
because he's not famous.


495
0:17:6,478 --> 0:17:7,679
- It's okay, mama.


496
0:17:7,679 --> 0:17:10,315
I got this.


497
0:17:10,315 --> 0:17:12,5
You ready?


498
0:17:12,5 --> 0:17:13,251
- I'm ready.


499
0:17:13,251 --> 0:17:15,787
- Drop your ball.


500
0:17:15,787 --> 0:17:18,389
Ooh.


501
0:17:18,389 --> 0:17:19,424
Yes!


502
0:17:19,424 --> 0:17:32,7
- Wait. Hold up.


503
0:17:32,7 --> 0:17:40,411
- Ergh!
- Ha-ha!


504
0:17:40,411 --> 0:17:44,182
- Yes!


505
0:17:44,182 --> 0:17:45,683
- Go in. Go in.
Go in. Go in.


506
0:17:45,683 --> 0:17:46,785
Go in. Go in... oh!


507
0:17:46,785 --> 0:17:48,62
- Yes!


508
0:17:48,62 --> 0:17:50,455
- Okay, Nick,


509
0:17:50,455 --> 0:17:53,358
You land a hole-in-one here,
the game is yours.


510
0:17:53,358 --> 0:17:56,6
If you don't, Anthony wins,


511
0:17:56,6 --> 0:17:57,295
You let everyone down,


512
0:17:57,295 --> 0:18:0,265
And you ruin
your first family vacation.


513
0:18:0,265 --> 0:18:2,367
No pressure.


514
0:18:2,367 --> 0:18:3,768
- Your mama.


515
0:18:3,768 --> 0:18:5,403
- Is that how that works?


516
0:18:5,403 --> 0:18:6,604
- That's how it works.


517
0:18:6,604 --> 0:18:7,806
- All right.


518
0:18:7,806 --> 0:18:8,873
- You can do it, Nick!


519
0:18:8,873 --> 0:18:10,208
Whoo!


520
0:18:10,208 --> 0:18:12,677
- That's right,
'cause I raised a winner.


521
0:18:12,677 --> 0:18:30,28
- And he's about
to become a loser.


522
0:18:30,28 --> 0:18:32,3
- Yes!
Yes!


523
0:18:32,3 --> 0:18:35,667
Yes!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!


524
0:18:35,667 --> 0:18:36,634
- Yeah!


525
0:18:36,634 --> 0:18:40,138
Ahhh!


526
0:18:40,138 --> 0:18:41,84
Whoo!
Whoo!


527
0:18:41,84 --> 0:18:43,341
Wow!


528
0:18:43,341 --> 0:18:45,76
Uh! Uh!


529
0:18:45,76 --> 0:18:48,58
Uh!


530
0:18:48,58 --> 0:18:49,581
- Good game, man.


531
0:18:49,581 --> 0:18:51,182
- Oh, good game?


532
0:18:51,182 --> 0:18:52,717
wait.


533
0:18:52,717 --> 0:18:54,752
After all that trash
you was talking,


534
0:18:54,752 --> 0:18:56,521
You just... all you can say
is, "good game"?


535
0:18:56,521 --> 0:18:58,489
Whoa, whoa, you're an actor,
man, look.


536
0:18:58,489 --> 0:18:59,991
Act like you got beat!


537
0:18:59,991 --> 0:19:1,226
- ooh. Ouch.


538
0:19:1,226 --> 0:19:2,861
- Hey, you need
some motivation, huh?


539
0:19:2,861 --> 0:19:8,633
Ask your mama!


540
0:19:8,633 --> 0:19:10,268
- That's all right.
That's all right.


541
0:19:10,268 --> 0:19:13,338
I'll see what you're all about
after my bocce ball tournament.


542
0:19:13,338 --> 0:19:15,139
- You tell him, baby.


543
0:19:15,139 --> 0:19:16,574
- Be quiet, mama.


544
0:19:16,574 --> 0:19:18,209
- Ooh.
- Loser.


545
0:19:18,209 --> 0:19:20,445
- How you gonna talk
to your mama like that?


546
0:19:20,445 --> 0:19:28,938
- Buh-bye.


547
0:19:28,938 --> 0:19:30,474
Hey guys.


548
0:19:30,474 --> 0:19:31,875
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, dad.


549
0:19:31,875 --> 0:19:32,876
- Quit playing for a sec.


550
0:19:32,876 --> 0:19:34,178
I've got a surprise for you.


551
0:19:34,178 --> 0:19:35,346
- Quick, stop playing.


552
0:19:35,346 --> 0:19:37,948
His last surprise was the best.


553
0:19:37,948 --> 0:19:39,75
- I have to interrupt.


554
0:19:39,75 --> 0:19:41,919
Okay, so I gave my Disney world
proposal to the client,


555
0:19:41,919 --> 0:19:42,986
And guess what.


556
0:19:42,986 --> 0:19:43,887
- What?


557
0:19:43,887 --> 0:19:45,356
- They said
it was the perfect site.


558
0:19:45,356 --> 0:19:46,357
Landed it!


559
0:19:46,357 --> 0:19:47,758
- Congratulations, baby.


560
0:19:47,758 --> 0:19:50,16
- Thank you.
Thank you.


561
0:19:50,16 --> 0:19:51,929
- But now it's time
for my surprise.


562
0:19:51,929 --> 0:19:52,896
- What?


563
0:19:52,896 --> 0:19:56,967
- I just edited
the Disney trip.


564
0:19:56,967 --> 0:19:58,135
- I cannot wait to see this.


565
0:19:58,135 --> 0:20:1,805
- Congratulations, baby.
- Thank you, honey.


566
0:20:1,805 --> 0:20:6,31
- I can't hold it much longer!


567
0:20:6,31 --> 0:20:7,911
We're in Disney world, player!


568
0:20:7,911 --> 0:20:10,581
- Whoo!
- Whoo!


569
0:20:10,581 --> 0:20:18,522
- Hey, Lindsey.
- Hi.


570
0:20:18,522 --> 0:20:22,926
- We saw Mr. Obama.


571
0:20:22,926 --> 0:20:23,994
- Oh, come on, no.


572
0:20:23,994 --> 0:20:30,367
- You know what?
Can you move over?


573
0:20:30,367 --> 0:20:31,568
- One, two, three...


574
0:20:31,568 --> 0:20:33,637
Animal kingdom!


575
0:20:33,637 --> 0:20:35,472
- I love it.
I'm having so much fun.


576
0:20:35,472 --> 0:20:36,573
I've had a great time.


577
0:20:36,573 --> 0:20:38,242
We watched the fireworks
last night,


578
0:20:38,242 --> 0:20:39,376
Just Nick and I.


579
0:20:39,376 --> 0:20:40,878
- Can I go get a funnel cake?


580
0:20:40,878 --> 0:20:44,448
- I can't wait
to get in another ride.


581
0:20:44,448 --> 0:20:45,682
- I'm just gonna lick it.


582
0:20:45,682 --> 0:20:47,985
- Oh, gross.


583
0:20:47,985 --> 0:20:49,319
- This is awesome.


584
0:20:49,319 --> 0:20:51,321
- We should try to make this
a yearly thing, huh?


585
0:20:51,321 --> 0:20:52,256
- I love it so much.


586
0:20:52,256 --> 0:20:54,24
- You enjoyed it
more than we did,


587
0:20:54,24 --> 0:20:55,192
And that's saying something.


588
0:20:55,192 --> 0:20:56,393
- And if you tell anybody,


589
0:20:56,393 --> 0:20:59,898
