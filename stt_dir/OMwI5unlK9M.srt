It's America's first

0:1:29,6 --> 0:1:32,31

41
0:1:32,31 --> 0:1:35,7
It started as a back-to-Africa
movement for freed slaves, and


42
0:1:35,7 --> 0:1:38,57
in fact, the Constitution was
written in Washington, and


43
0:1:38,57 --> 0:1:42,14
Monrovia, the capital city of
Liberia, is actually named


44
0:1:42,14 --> 0:1:43,44
after President Monroe.

in the 1840s.

Africa and promptly enslave

the native Africans based on the
plantation method they had


48
0:1:52,91 --> 0:1:56,42
learned in the US, which lasts
for about 140 years, until

210
0:8:53,48 --> 0:8:54,73
Nobody's recording.


211
0:8:54,73 --> 0:8:57,12



212
0:8:57,12 --> 0:8:57,49
SHANE SMITH: Sure.


213
0:8:57,49 --> 0:8:59,29
I can give him cash.


214
0:8:59,29 --> 0:9:1,41
Can we-- can we pay him
and pay you a fine


215
0:9:1,41 --> 0:9:2,33
and then take him?


216
0:9:2,33 --> 0:9:2,683
POLICEMAN: Fine.


217
0:9:2,683 --> 0:9:3,39
SHANE SMITH: OK, great.


218
0:9:3,39 --> 0:9:3,87
POLICEMAN: That's good.


219
0:9:3,87 --> 0:9:4,82
SHANE SMITH: OK.


220
0:9:4,82 --> 0:9:8,19
OK, let's go, let's go, let's
go, let's go, let's go.


221
0:9:8,19 --> 0:9:9,574
OK, let's go, let's go.


222
0:9:9,574 --> 0:9:17,17



223
0:9:17,17 --> 0:9:18,2
MALE SPEAKER 5: Hey, hey, you.


224
0:9:18,2 --> 0:9:19,682
SHANE SMITH: We went in there.


225
0:9:19,682 --> 0:9:22,9
And we're being followed by
the police right now.


226
0:9:22,9 --> 0:9:24,68
SHANE SMITH: Yeah, we might
have to change tapes or do


227
0:9:24,68 --> 0:9:26,3
something, because--


228
0:9:26,3 --> 0:9:29,3
what we do is we shoot cards,
and if they come, we can give


229
0:9:29,3 --> 0:9:29,73
them the tape.


230
0:9:29,73 --> 0:9:32,53
There's nothing on the tape.


231
0:9:32,53 --> 0:9:33,78
SHANE SMITH: Yeah,
we do right now.


232
0:9:33,78 --> 0:9:52,17



233
0:9:52,17 --> 0:9:56,54
SHANE SMITH: Our trip is getting
progressively heavier.


234
0:9:56,54 --> 0:9:59,76
SHANE SMITH: Yeah,
that'd be good.


235
0:9:59,76 --> 0:10:0,13
OK.


236
0:10:0,13 --> 0:10:2,17
I'm kind of a little bit worried
that the police are


237
0:10:2,17 --> 0:10:3,57
going to come get
us right now.


238
0:10:3,57 --> 0:10:5,54
I gave them a fake name
and fake number.


239
0:10:5,54 --> 0:10:11,233



240
0:10:11,233 --> 0:10:11,716
SHANE SMITH: OK.


241
0:10:11,716 --> 0:10:13,165
Nice to meet you.


242
0:10:13,165 --> 0:10:14,415
SHANE SMITH: Nice to meet you.


243
0:10:14,415 --> 0:10:18,1



244
0:10:18,1 --> 0:10:18,95
SHANE SMITH: Thank you.


245
0:10:18,95 --> 0:10:19,81
Thank you.


246
0:10:19,81 --> 0:10:21,37
SHANE SMITH: So after we got Bin
Laden out of jail, he was


247
0:10:21,37 --> 0:10:23,8
very excited to get us
up to his rooftop


248
0:10:23,8 --> 0:10:24,4
and tell us his story.


249
0:10:24,4 --> 0:10:27,2
And according to him, the
ex-generals, who are now the


250
0:10:27,2 --> 0:10:29,91
community leaders, are the only
ones doing anything to


251
0:10:29,91 --> 0:10:31,13
help the people.


252
0:10:31,13 --> 0:10:34,4
So maybe you could explain a
little bit about-- so first of


253
0:10:34,4 --> 0:10:36,99
all, you became known as Bin
Laden during the war.


254
0:10:36,99 --> 0:10:37,7
GENERAL BIN LADEN:
During the war.


255
0:10:37,7 --> 0:10:39,46
SHANE SMITH: And then after the
war, now you're sort of


256
0:10:39,46 --> 0:10:42,11
trying to help people by
carpentry and by karate.


257
0:10:42,11 --> 0:10:43,36
GENERAL BIN LADEN: And karate.


258
0:10:43,36 --> 0:11:0,28



259
0:11:0,28 --> 0:11:1,53
SHANE SMITH: Do get
any money here?


260
0:11:1,53 --> 0:11:5,98



261
0:11:5,98 --> 0:11:8,9
SHANE SMITH: Yeah, but the UN,
or the government doesn't give


262
0:11:8,9 --> 0:11:9,34
you any money?


263
0:11:9,34 --> 0:11:20,25



264
0:11:20,25 --> 0:11:21,92
SHANE SMITH: And is this--
is this area--


265
0:11:21,92 --> 0:11:22,94
this is Red Light, here?


266
0:11:22,94 --> 0:11:23,65
GENERAL BIN LADEN: It's
Red Light [INAUDIBLE].


267
0:11:23,65 --> 0:11:24,88
This is Red Light.


268
0:11:24,88 --> 0:11:26,13
SHANE SMITH: And is it--


269
0:11:26,13 --> 0:11:27,82
is there a lot of crime
in Red Light.


270
0:11:27,82 --> 0:11:28,28
GENERAL BIN LADEN: Yeah.


271
0:11:28,28 --> 0:11:29,9
It's [INAUDIBLE].


272
0:11:29,9 --> 0:11:29,68
This is Red Light.


273
0:11:29,68 --> 0:11:30,93
SHANE SMITH: Red Light.


274
0:11:30,93 --> 0:12:10,57



275
0:12:10,57 --> 0:12:12,94
SHANE SMITH: So Myles comes
over, stops the interview, and


276
0:12:12,94 --> 0:12:15,19
says, we have to get the
fuck out of here now.


277
0:12:15,19 --> 0:12:17,44
And Bin Laden looks down,
and he goes, yeah, yeah.


278
0:12:17,44 --> 0:12:18,26
Those aren't my guys.


279
0:12:18,26 --> 0:12:19,51
You guys should really go.


280
0:12:19,51 --> 0:12:22,2



281
0:12:22,2 --> 0:12:24,71
So Bin Laden gave us an escort
and a couple of his guys got


282
0:12:24,71 --> 0:12:29,955
us through the crowd to the car,
and we got the fuck out.


283
0:12:29,955 --> 0:12:30,446
CAMERAMAN: Let's go.


284
0:12:30,446 --> 0:12:30,937
Let's go.


285
0:12:30,937 --> 0:12:31,428
Let's go.


286
0:12:31,428 --> 0:12:31,919
Let's go.


287
0:12:31,919 --> 0:12:32,41
Let's go.


288
0:12:32,41 --> 0:12:34,865
Let's go.


289
0:12:34,865 --> 0:12:37,32
Holy fucking shit.


290
0:12:37,32 --> 0:12:38,793
That was out of hand.


291
0:12:38,793 --> 0:12:40,266
We gotta get out of here.


292
0:12:40,266 --> 0:12:43,71



293
0:12:43,71 --> 0:12:45,668
There was some heavy-duty
vibes there.


294
0:12:45,668 --> 0:12:49,84



295
0:12:49,84 --> 0:12:52,19
SHANE SMITH: So after meeting
and being freaked out by


296
0:12:52,19 --> 0:12:54,74
General Bin Laden, we wanted
to see what the UN and


297
0:12:54,74 --> 0:12:56,775
government were doing
to rebuild Liberia.


298
0:12:56,775 --> 0:13:0,32
So we met a local journalist
named Nagbe and we asked him,


299
0:13:0,32 --> 0:13:1,39
and he said, you want
to see what the


300
0:13:1,39 --> 0:13:2,82
government and UN are doing?


301
0:13:2,82 --> 0:13:4,7
I'll take you to West Point.


302
0:13:4,7 --> 0:13:14,63



303
0:13:14,63 --> 0:13:17,6
So West Point is the worst slum
in Liberia, which makes


304
0:13:17,6 --> 0:13:19,72
it one of the worst slums in
West Africa, which makes it


305
0:13:19,72 --> 0:13:21,23
one of the worst slums
in the world.


306
0:13:21,23 --> 0:13:23,74
And when you first get there,
the first thing you want to do


307
0:13:23,74 --> 0:13:24,93
is get the hell out.


308
0:13:24,93 --> 0:13:28,74
It's open sewers everywhere,
shit, piss, garbage,


309
0:13:28,74 --> 0:13:30,7
everything mixed in.


310
0:13:30,7 --> 0:13:31,47
And the stench is
overpowering.


311
0:13:31,47 --> 0:14:1,1



312
0:14:1,1 --> 0:14:2,8
CAMERAMAN: Oh, dude.


313
0:14:2,8 --> 0:14:4,4
It really stinks here.


314
0:14:4,4 --> 0:14:15,79



315
0:14:15,79 --> 0:14:18,67
SHANE SMITH: But I mean, one of
the first basic rules is,


316
0:14:18,67 --> 0:14:19,87
don't shit where you eat.


317
0:14:19,87 --> 0:14:20,7
IMMANUEL NAGBE: That's
it, but--


318
0:14:20,7 --> 0:14:21,95
SHANE SMITH: That's the
number one rule.


319
0:14:21,95 --> 0:14:25,21



320
0:14:25,21 --> 0:14:26,59
SHANE SMITH: But the government
has to do something


321
0:14:26,59 --> 0:14:27,84
about that--


322
0:14:27,84 --> 0:14:35,23



323
0:14:35,23 --> 0:14:37,25
SHANE SMITH: So even in one of
the worst slums of Western


324
0:14:37,25 --> 0:14:41,1
Africa, you see the cultural
impact that America has there.


325
0:14:41,1 --> 0:14:43,44
All the kids are wearing Biggie
or Tupac t-shirts.


326
0:14:43,44 --> 0:14:45,29
And in fact, one kid
came up to us and


327
0:14:45,29 --> 0:14:46,87
said, hey, I'm a rapper.


328
0:14:46,87 --> 0:14:47,78
Can I rap for you?


329
0:14:47,78 --> 0:14:48,9
And we said yes.


330
0:14:48,9 --> 0:14:52,25
And it wasn't about bling, and
it wasn't about Cristal.


331

[DOG BARKING]


333
0:15:26,955 --> 0:15:29,88
SHANE SMITH: And is there a
lot of malaria in here?


334
0:15:29,88 --> 0:15:31,83
SHANE SMITH: Needless to say,
in West Point, health


335
0:15:31,83 --> 0:15:33,32
conditions are foul.


336
0:15:33,32 --> 0:15:34,62
Diseases everywhere.


337
0:15:34,62 --> 0:15:37,616
Malaria, infections, and
AIDS are rampant.


338
0:15:37,616 --> 0:15:49,43



339
0:15:49,43 --> 0:15:51,65
SHANE SMITH: Yeah?


340
0:15:51,65 --> 0:15:52,97
SHANE SMITH: Cover-up
for heroin.


341
0:15:52,97 --> 0:15:53,47
SHANE SMITH: Wow.


342
0:15:53,47 --> 0:15:54,45
IMMANUEL NAGBE: It's
a big business.


343
0:15:54,45 --> 0:15:56,83
SHANE SMITH: We heard stories
that during the war, the


344
0:15:56,83 --> 0:15:59,76
rebels would go out in boats
with diamonds and trade the


345
0:15:59,76 --> 0:16:3,43
diamonds for weapons and
cocaine, and it was a lot of


346
0:16:3,43 --> 0:16:6,45
Colombians and Mexicans.


347
0:16:6,45 --> 0:16:8,83
SHANE SMITH: We find it
interesting, because cocaine


348
0:16:8,83 --> 0:16:10,52
and heroin are very
expensive drugs.


349
0:16:10,52 --> 0:16:12,12
So we were surprised to
find heroin here.


350
0:16:12,12 --> 0:16:16,8
Usually, in poorer countries,
there's speed or meth or


351
0:16:16,8 --> 0:16:18,12
things you can make.


352
0:16:18,12 --> 0:16:19,37
SHANE SMITH: Why is that?


353
0:16:19,37 --> 0:16:21,8



354

[CHILD CRYING]


355
0:16:25,0 --> 0:16:57,46



356
0:16:57,46 --> 0:16:59,55
SHANE SMITH: Liberian dollars?


357
0:16:59,55 --> 0:16:59,33
IMMANUEL NAGBE: Liberian
dollars.


358
0:16:59,33 --> 0:17:1,29
SHANE SMITH: So how
much is that?


359
0:17:1,29 --> 0:17:3,35
SHANE SMITH: So because of the
poverty, a lot of women have


360
0:17:3,35 --> 0:17:4,74
to become prostitutes.


361
0:17:4,74 --> 0:17:5,99
IMMANUEL NAGBE: Yes.


362
0:17:5,99 --> 0:17:8,3



363
0:17:8,3 --> 0:17:9,589
SHANE SMITH: Sex worker.


364
0:17:9,589 --> 0:17:10,839
IMMANUEL NAGBE: We
can go this way.


365
0:17:10,839 --> 0:17:43,33



366
0:17:43,33 --> 0:17:44,58
IMMANUEL NAGBE: Condoms, here.


367
0:17:44,58 --> 0:17:59,36



368
0:17:59,36 --> 0:18:1,92
SHANE SMITH: So on our first day
in Liberia, we see child


369
0:18:1,92 --> 0:18:5,95
junkies, shit and piss
everywhere, malaria, AIDS,


370
0:18:5,95 --> 0:18:10,29
rape, and now we started hearing
about cannibalism.


371
0:18:10,29 --> 0:18:13,56
The scaredest I was, was we
actually shot in West Point,


372
0:18:13,56 --> 0:18:15,59
which is the worst slum
in West Africa.


373
0:18:15,59 --> 0:18:17,94
And it's kind of these rabbit
warren streets.


374
0:18:17,94 --> 0:18:20,9
And we went to shoot in a
brothel with these junkies,


375
0:18:20,9 --> 0:18:21,87
and the junkies started
asking for money.


376
0:18:21,87 --> 0:18:22,65
Like, where's my money?


377
0:18:22,65 --> 0:18:23,64
Where's my money?


378
0:18:23,64 --> 0:18:25,9
And people started hearing
"money" and just flooded into


379
0:18:25,9 --> 0:18:26,5
the brothel.


380
0:18:26,5 --> 0:18:27,62
Like money, money, money.


381
0:18:27,62 --> 0:18:28,45
So we took off.


382
0:18:28,45 --> 0:18:31,14
The problem is, you take off,
you can't go anywhere, because


383
0:18:31,14 --> 0:18:33,9
there's these little streets
that, you know, there's no


384
0:18:33,9 --> 0:18:34,82
rhyme or reason to them.


385
0:18:34,82 --> 0:18:36,4
So we're all running
around in the dark.


386
0:18:36,4 --> 0:18:39,16
We finally get back to the
car, against all odds.


387
0:18:39,16 --> 0:18:41,39
We get in the car, and our
driver's so freaked out about


388
0:18:41,39 --> 0:18:44,1
the mob following us that he
peels off and nearly kills


389
0:18:44,1 --> 0:18:44,69
some people.


390
0:18:44,69 --> 0:18:47,31
Which is terrifying, because
if you kill people down in


391
0:18:47,31 --> 0:18:49,47
West Point, they'll just
take the car, rip


392
0:18:49,47 --> 0:18:50,51
you limb from limb.


393
0:18:50,51 --> 0:18:52,88
And so against all odds,
we get out of there.


394
0:18:52,88 --> 0:18:55,32
And I'm like shaking and
nervous, whatever.


395
0:18:55,32 --> 0:18:58,36
And as we go, we realize, oh,
now it's time to meet General
