###1 THE PRESIDENT: Thank you all very much. I like to tell people part of my job is to be
###26 the educator-in-chief. And today we're at a really interesting facility in North Carolina
###34 to talk about what's possible; what dreamers are doing to enable us to achieve a very important
###44 national goal, and that is to become less dependent on oil from overseas, thereby ensuring
###52 that our national security interests are better intact and our economic security interests
###58 are better intact and that we're better stewards of the environment. That's what we're here
###61 to talk about.
###61 But before I do, I do want to thank some people. First, Laura sends her regrets. I'm a lucky
###72 boy to have her -- (laughter) -- to have her as my wife. We've got a lot of friends here
###77 in Carolina, and she sends her best wishes to our Carolina friends. I told some folks
###84 yesterday, I'm not very objective when it comes to my wife, but I think the country
###88 is really lucky to have her as the First Lady. (Applause.)
###101 We're here at Novozymes, which is a company that makes enzymes. We're going to talk to
###105 Thomas, who is the President and Plant Manager, about what they do here, and why it's relevant.
###111 Before we get there, I do want to say something about Steen Riisgaard. He's the President
###115 and CEO, Steen. He flew over from Denmark. I can't thank you enough for coming. I appreciate
###121 you being here. It's interesting, isn't it, when you're able to sit in North Carolina
###128 and talk about a Danish company that is investing to not only help us become less dependent
###136 on oil, but equally importantly is investing capital, which enables citizens from the United
###142 States to find good work.
###144 I toured around the facility, and I asked people at the facility how long they had been
###152 working here. And a lot of people have been here 20-plus years. So for those people who
###157 are worried about free trade, I want you to remember that if this country were to wall
###162 ourselves off from the world, we would miss opportunities to find markets for our products,
###168 and at the same time miss opportunities for citizens who work at a facility like this
###173 to find good work. It's in our interests that we have free and fair trade.
###178 And so I thank you very much, Steen, for investing in the United States of America, and I appreciate
###183 the fact that you're sensitive to the needs of the workers here in the United States of
###187 America. And I see you're sitting next to your Ambassador. Mr. Ambassador, welcome.
###189 I'm glad you're here. (Applause.)
###197 A person who understands the vast potential in the lands here in North Carolina to make
###206 us less dependent on oil is Richard Burr. He's the United States Senator. I'm proud
###209 he's joined us today, and thank you for coming, Senator. There you go. (Applause.) Congressman
###214 G.K. Butterfield. Thank you for being here, G.K. Appreciate you coming. (Applause.) He's
###220 a United States Congressman from the neighboring district, but he has enough interest in making
###231 sure that we succeed in alternative sources of energy, that he's here. He's also on an
###237 important subcommittee in the House. I appreciate your interest. Appreciate you joining us.
###242 I want to thank the Agricultural Commissioner from the great state of North Carolina, Steve
###246 Troxler, who's joined us today. Steve, thank you for coming. There he is, right there.
###253 (Applause.) See, Steve needs to take an interest in this like he is, because doesn't it make
###260 sense to be able to say to our farmers, grow what you can grow so we become less dependent
###266 on oil. I like the idea of a President being able to say, wow, the crop report is in, we're
###273 growing more corn than ever before, which means we're importing less oil from overseas.
###279 It's an exciting time to think about that our farmers not only are going to grow what
###288 we need to eat, but it's going to grow what we need to run our automobiles.
###290 And that's coming. That's what we're here to discuss today. I know it sounds like a
###293 pipe dream to some -- you know, there goes the optimistic President talking again. But
###299 you're going to hear from some experts here. I'm just a history major. (Laughter.) And
###308 I'm with Ph.D.s. (Laughter.) Let me remind you who the President is. (Laughter and applause.)
###319 But the Ph.D.s are providing the brain power necessary to help plants like this develop
###328 technologies that will enable us to convert wood chips into fuels that are running automobiles.
###338 It's an interesting time, isn't it, when you're able to say, we're on the verge of some breakthroughs
###344 that will enable a pile of wood chips to become the raw materials for fuels that will run
###349 your car.
###350 I appreciate the Mayor, Jenny Edwards, here, Mayor of Franklinton, for joining us. Where
###355 are you, Madam Mayor? Thanks for coming. Proud to see you again. (Applause.) And all the
###358 Novozymes employees, I appreciate you setting this deal up and I appreciate you putting
###369 up with the hundreds who travel with me. (Laughter.) And thank you for your warm hospitality.
###375 Look, here's -- I just told you the goal. The goal is for the United States to be -- to
###380 diversify away from old, old ways. And it's possible. And I do believe it is a proper
###388 use of your money, taxpayers' money, to spend to encourage research on interesting ideas.
###396 We spent about $12 billion since I've been your President to try to stimulate technologies
###404 that will literally change the way we live. A lot of that money has gone into clean coal
###409 technologies. If you're worried about dependency on oil from overseas, then it seems to make
###415 sense to me that we ought to be able to have the technology so that we can better use the
###420 resources we have here at home.
###422 I don't know if you know this, we've got about 250 years worth of coal in America. That's
###428 what they estimate. And it makes sense, therefore, to spend money at the federal level to develop
###435 technologies so we can burn that coal in environmentally friendly ways. The idea is to have zero emission
###441 coal-fired plants here in America. And it's possible, and we're making progress toward
###445 that goal.
###446 I happen to believe that if you're concerned about the environment and want to deal with
###450 renewable sources of energy, that we need to pursue nuclear power. Those power plants
###458 emit zero greenhouse gases. It doesn't require any hydrocarbons from overseas to run those
###466 plants. So we're beginning to license new plants. We're spending money on wind and solar
###473 energies. It makes sense to be able to -- as the price of hydrocarbons goes up, it makes
###481 sense that there be alternative sources of energy coming to the market as quickly as
###485 possible.
###486 So we're making pretty good progress. But if you really want to reduce the amount of
###490 oil that you consume, you got to reduce the amount of gasoline you use. In other words,
###496 if you say, we want to reduce our dependence on oil, what you really got to do is change
###502 gasoline usage in the United States. And there's a couple of exciting things that are taking
###508 place -- one is new battery technologies. We're spending money at the federal level
###513 -- and by the way, there's a lot of private sector money going into alternative sources
###517 of energy. And some day you're going to be able to get in your car, particularly if you're
###521 a big-city person, and drive 40 miles on a battery. It's coming. And by the way, the
###530 car doesn't have to look like a golf cart. (Laughter.) It could be a pickup truck. (Laughter.)
###538 And that technology is around the corner. And if we're able to drive the first 40 miles,
###544 or, say, 20 miles, on gasoline [sic] there's a lot of big-city folks that will never have
###548 to use a drop of gasoline on a daily basis. They'll be driving via electricity. These
###555 are lithium-ion batteries, technology -- so when you hear that term, you just got to know
###559 there's a lot of folks and a lot of money aiming hard to get this to the market as quickly
###564 as possible. Why? Because we've set a goal for the United States to be less dependent
###569 on oil.
###569 Secondly -- and this is what we're here to talk about today -- is ethanol. It says that
###577 the new developments in ethanol -- in other words, fuel derived from corn -- can be diversified.
###585 Here's the problem: Right now we're consuming about 7 billion gallons of ethanol a year
###592 made from corn. And it's a pretty standard process. People here at this facility have
###598 developed the enzymes necessary to break the corn down in an efficient way so that we can
###601 use ethanol derived from corn.
###605 The problem is we got a lot of hog growers around the United States and a lot of them
###611 here in North Carolina who are beginning to feel the pinch as a result of high corn prices.
###616 A lot of the cattle people around the United States -- I have got a few of them in my home
###622 state of Texas -- they're worried about high corn prices affecting their making a livelihood.
###629 In other words, the demand for corn, because of agricultural use, and now energy use, is
###637 causing corn prices to go up. I bet you the Agriculture Commissioner is hearing from folks.
###643 And so how do -- the question then is, how do you achieve your goal of less dependence
###648 on oil without breaking your farmers -- without breaking your hog raisers -- corn farmers
###655 happen to like it, but I'm talking about the -- (laughter) -- people dependent on corn.
###660 And here's how: You develop new technologies that will enable you to make ethanol from
###666 wood chips, or stalk grass, or agricultural waste. And that's what we're here to talk
###673 about: Is it possible, and if it is possible, how close are we to achieving the technological
###680 breakthroughs that I believe are possible so that our -- so that we're changing our
###687 habits.
###689 And these are exciting times, they really are. I've always said, America needs to stay
###692 on the leading edge of technological change. It will mean we remain a really important
###699 economy in the world, but it will also mean that our folks will be able to find good high-paying
###705 jobs.
###705 In this case, being on the leading edge of technological change means that we'll also
###709 be able to deal simultaneous with economic insecurities that come when China demands
###716 more for oil, the world produces less, the price of oil goes up, and so does the price
###720 of gas at the pump here in North Carolina; national security concerns where some people
###726 who've got oil don't like us, and therefore, may be willing to use their energy resources
###733 to try to cause America to take a different view of the world; and environmental concerns.
###742 And all these three concerns come together with technology as the solution.
###750 And so Thomas, tell people what you do. (Laughter and applause.)
###755 MR. NAGY: That was a -- that was a nice introduction. Thank you, Mr. President. You may know, and
###768 many of you here -- first of all, I want to welcome you very, very deep from my heart
###774 and from all my colleagues here in Franklinton, welcome to North Carolina, welcome to Novozymes,
###778 and also welcome to the guests here. (Applause.)
###788 THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you. Like you're the President, right?
###792 MR. NAGY: Well, you're the President. (Laughter.) Okay, anyways --
###795 THE PRESIDENT: It didn't take him long to learn, you know. (Laughter.)
###800 MR. NAGY: Novozymes is the world's leading biotechnology company within the field of
###805 industrial enzymes and microorganisms. We market more than 600 products around the globe,
###810 and all of these products have the same in common, that they -- sort of like it's good
###814 for environment, it's good for businesses, because when using our products, you use less
###819 resources, less energy, less water, and hence, you make better use --
###822 THE PRESIDENT: So you make enzymes.
###823 MR. NAGY: We make enzymes. And enzymes is sort of like the key component you need to
###829 have when you convert starch or the corn to sugar that you can then make to alcohol or
###834 the ethanol. But also, it's got to be the key component when you want to make your switchgrass
###843 or your biomass to sugar and then to ethanol.
###847 THE PRESIDENT: So the enzyme begins to break down the raw materials in a particular raw
###853 material that will enable us to make more ethanol, is that what you're saying?
###856 MR. NAGY: That is correct.
###857 THE PRESIDENT: Now -- so, is this a -- is this like a huge distillery?
###861 MR. NAGY: Our plant here?
###863 THE PRESIDENT: Yes.
###864 MR. NAGY: Well, you could say what we do here, we use microorganisms, and the way we make
###868 these enzymes is by the use of these microorganisms. And you could compare our process to if you
###875 brew beer or wine. We take some agriculture raw materials like starch, again, or corn,
###881 and then we ferment the insides, basically, like you would ferment wine. The product here
###887 is the enzymes that we can then ship off to ethanol plants around in the U.S. And they
###894 use it today to break down the starch in corn and make ethanol. So we are a key provider
###899 of a key technology to make this happen for you.
###903 THE PRESIDENT: Absolutely. And I presume that one of the bottlenecks to achieving widespread
###909 ethanol production is the cost of enzymes. Have you seen any appreciable decline in the
###915 cost of enzymes since you have been --
###918 MR. NAGY: Certainly. We have worked with enzymes for many, many years at Novozymes. We have
###924 a 60-year tradition of this, and so we are very, very good at it. We are the leading
###929 edge on all the technologies in all the markets we are, and therefore we are a company dedicated
###935 to innovation, because innovation, as you talk about, being able to compete with others,
###941 innovation is our tool to do so. And so we reinvest more than 10 percent -- actually
###946 13 percent of our annual sales back into R&D.
###950 The research we do in cellulosic ethanol right now is the biggest research of what we have
###957 in the company, where more than a hundred researchers around the globe work on solving
###962 the issues ahead of us. What we have been able to do since 2000 until we reported it
###967 in 2005, on a grant provided to us from Department of Energy, is to reduce the cost of conversion
###975 by a factor of 30.
###976 THE PRESIDENT: I want to repeat, because you actually -- he's talking about your money.
###982 (Laughter.) And he said that we gave a grant -- we, the taxpayers of the United States,
###987 gave a grant to the researchers of this company, see if they could not reduce the cost of producing
###992 the enzymes that would be critical to making ethanol, and this company was able to do so
###996 -- reduced the cost by a factor of 30, which I think is a justifiable use of taxpayer's
###1002 money to see those kinds of results.
###1004 MR. NAGY: Thank you.
###1005 THE PRESIDENT: You got a lot of Ph.D.s and advanced degrees here?
###1008 MR. NAGY: Yes, we do. (Laughter.) We have a few, yes.
###1009 THE PRESIDENT: You do?
###1010 MR. NAGY: Yes, we do.
###1011 THE PRESIDENT: The reason I mention that is that part of remaining a competitive society
###1016 is to make sure our children get a good education early, so that it is possible to get advanced
###1023 degrees -- at least a degree beyond high school. If you want a good job in America, you better
###1034 go on after high school. The jobs in places like this are jobs that require brain power,
###1039 as much as anything else. And, therefore, the educational system of this state, for
###1044 example, has been critical in attracting industries such as the company we're talking about here.
###1049 I mean, I go walking through the halls and shaking hands with people -- we got people
###1053 on -- doing sophisticated computer programming; we got lab technicians who have got advanced
###1058 degrees in bioengineering. And my only point is it reminds me of how important higher education
###1065 is for this country. And I applaud the folks of North Carolina about being on the leading
###1072 edge of education, and that's why you got companies like here, like this company here,
###1077 paying pretty good money for jobs, I guess.
###1079 MR. NAGY: That's correct. One of the reasons, and what we really enjoy here is also the
###1082 -- you alluded to the education system here, but it's an integrated system from community
###1089 colleges through all the levels at university. And there's a number of universities in the
###1095 state that we also enjoy very close collaboration amongst. Some of them are NC State University,
###1100 of course.
###1101 THE PRESIDENT: Good. Well, Thomas, thanks, buddy. I appreciate it. You handled it well.
###1108 (Laughter.)
###1109 Kevin Wenger. Yes, Kevin, how are you? What do you do?
###1113 DR. WENGER: I'm the manager of the R&D group that we have here in North Carolina for ethanol
###1119 research.
###1119 THE PRESIDENT: For this company.
###1121 DR. WENGER: For this company, yes. We, about five years ago, decided to invest in a dedicated
###1128 R&D group for ethanol process development, and we decided to anchor that research group
###1134 here in North Carolina, because the U.S. is really where the ethanol market has been very
###1140 strong.
###1141 THE PRESIDENT: And you've got a degree in what?
###1143 DR. WENGER: I have a degree in chemical engineering, Ph.D. from Colorado State University.
###1149 THE PRESIDENT: Good.
###1149 DR. WENGER: And I've been here in Novozymes since I finished graduate school in 1994.
###1155 THE PRESIDENT: And so in 1994, were you thinking switchgrass into -- (laughter.)
###1161 DR. WENGER: I've always been interested in alternative energy and making ethanol. There
###1170 wasn't so many jobs related to switchgrass in 1994. (Laughter.)
###1174 THE PRESIDENT: Well, cellulosic.
###1176 DR. WENGER: Yes. But I was always -- I've always been interested in fermentation also,
###1180 and so Novozymes is a fermentation company and that's how I ended up here.
###1184 THE PRESIDENT: Interesting. And so I'd like to quote what he said. Kevin said, "It's going
###1189 to be a challenge," -- talking about achieving what we're talking about here -- "but if we
###1192 look at how far we've come in the past five years, we have so much momentum, it shouldn't
###1199 be that tough."
###1201 And the reason I quote a person who knows what he's talking about when it comes to developments
###1205 necessary to bring the cellulosic ethanol to market, I quote him because I presume in
###1214 that optimism there's realism.
###1215 DR. WENGER: Yes, I'm very optimistic, but also I can see how the 20-in-10 goal is very
###1222 achievable. If you look at what's happening now, what's been happening with corn ethanol
###1227 over the last five years and the developments that are coming in terms of implementation
###1232 of cellulosic, it's really amazing. Things are really starting to happen.
###1236 THE PRESIDENT: What he referred to is something I should have talked about earlier, and that
###1239 is I set a goal of the United States reducing our gasoline consumption by 20 percent over
###1245 the next 10 years. That's the 20-10 goal. In other words, it is a goal. And I mandated
###1251 a fuel standard that says we'll be using 35 million gallons of ethanol or alternative
###1258 fuel over the next 10 years.
###1261 Now, the reason I did this is I think it's possible to do it. And the reason I think
###1265 it's possible to do it is because of people like Kevin telling me it's possible. Remember,
###1269 I'm the history major. (Laughter.) And so the advances you've seen in five years -- if
###1276 you're able to take yourself back five years ago to today, it is a noticeable difference,
###1282 a -- obviously reduced the cost of enzyme, for example, which is an important development.
###1286 DR. WENGER: Yes, absolutely, it's a very noticeable difference and in terms of the number of industry
###1293 players that are really interested in this technology and are also willing to invest
###1299 in making this technology happen, including Novozymes as an industry player, it's really
###1304 amazing what we're seeing over the last five years.
###1307 THE PRESIDENT: The high price of energy has caused private capital to say that it's going
###1313 to be impossible for a society like the United States to sustain its use on gasoline. So
###1317 whether it be Novozymes who is investing, or private sector funds, that money is coming
###1324 in. They're fueling new research and development. So we've got the government helping, but also
###1329 you've just got to know that the private sector is very much involved with trying to invent
###1333 the technologies necessary to take advantage of a society that recognizes it has to diversify
###1339 away from energy.
###1340 And I repeat to you, we're all connected, and so when a Chinese economy grows and their
###1346 demand for oil goes up, it affects the price that you pay for gasoline. People got to know
###1352 that. And therefore, it's important for us to continue to advance these kinds of research
###1357 projects.
###1357 I met Dr. Mike in Greeley, Colorado, a year ago.
###1363 DR. PACHECO: Golden, Colorado.
###1365 THE PRESIDENT: Exactly, Golden, Colorado. How quickly they forget. (Laughter.) I am
###1371 60. (Laughter.) Golden, Colorado. Michael, tell them who you work for.
###1376 DR. PACHECO: Mr. President, I work for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. We're
###1380 the leading laboratory for the Department of Energy in the field of renewable energy.
###1384 We have a very robust program, as you know, in the field of biofuels, and it's focused
###1389 right now on cellulosic ethanol.
###1392 I agree with Kevin, your 20-in-10 goal is very achievable. In fact, the growth of the
###1396 corn and the biodiesel industry, which since you signed the Energy Policy Act two years
###1400 ago, have been growing at over 100 percent per year. Those fuels are going to make a
###1404 major portion of that 20 percent. But we have to, as you indicated, begin the transition
###1410 to use a broader base of fuels.
###1412 Two years ago we issued a study with USDA, two agencies together, that showed that the
###1418 U.S. could produce enough raw biomass that's equivalent to about 60 percent of all the
###1424 oil that we use in the United States. The problem is that most of that biomass is not
###1428 an easy material to convert. It's not like corn grain. And so our research --
###1432 THE PRESIDENT: Explain to people what you're talking about.
###1434 DR. PACHECO: Things like forest residues, things like fast-growing trees and switchgrass
###1437 -- the major constituent in that material is a cellulose fiber, usually accounts for
###1442 more than half of --
###1443 THE PRESIDENT: Do you know what switchgrass is? Tell them what switchgrass is.
###1446 DR. PACHECO: Switchgrass is a native grass that grew in the Midwest; it's a grass that
###1449 grows in relatively poor conditions, it can survive droughts very well.
###1452 THE PRESIDENT: Rocky soil and dry. Sounds kind of like parts of Texas, doesn't it? (Laughter.)
###1459 Imagine, however, if you're able to grow a grass where it's rocky soil and dry that you're
###1465 able to convert into energy. You're talking about a major change in the lifestyle of your
###1471 children and my children and their kids. I mean, this is -- anyway, go ahead. (Laughter.)
###1476 DR. PACHECO: You're doing very well. (Laughter.)
###1479 THE PRESIDENT: I am passionate on the subject. (Laughter and applause.)
###1483 DR. PACHECO: But that's a really big part of it, Mr. President, being able to move to those marginal conditions
###1497 and grow crops in areas where we're not currently growing crops, and then to have those crops
###1501 that are specifically designed to produce feedstocks that are adapted well for the enzymes
###1506 that Novozymes is producing can really increase the yield -- that is, how much ethanol we
###1511 can make from a ton of biomass.
###1512 One of the challenges when we started this project between NREL and Novozymes was that
###1518 no one in the world really felt like enzymes could be a cost-effective technology in producing
###1523 ethanol from raw material. Today all the leading researchers in the world are working in that
###1528 area because of the partnerships and because of the progress that Kevin has already talked
###1533 about.
###1533 But we're not there yet. And while I'm optimistic, like Kevin, there's still a lot of hard work
###1537 left to do, Mr. President. And we have work in the pre-treatment area, we have work still
###1541 to do in the enzymatic hydrolysis, and we still have research in the fermentation side.
###1546 And so DOE right now is considering proposals to work with industry in the area of developing
###1551 fermentation organisms, which is a really important part because the yeast, the bugs
###1555 today that we use to make ethanol won't work in the future with these new feedstocks. So
###1560 it's really important that we start this transition.
###1562 At NREL we work with all the other national labs. We especially work with Argon National
###1567 Lab and Pacific Northwest and Idaho and Oakridge. Those are all labs that work together within
###1573 my center, and we try to coordinate our efforts to utilize all the skills at the national
###1577 laboratories, because each of the labs brings a unique set of skills to this challenging
###1581 problem. We also work with a lot of other companies, in addition to Novozymes. And those
###1586 interactions are equally as important, because one of the things that we're trying to do,
###1589 Mr. President -- when we talked last year we talked about this -- is to try to develop
###1593 transitions that grow from existing industries. So instead of replacing the corn ethanol industry,
###1598 we see cellulosic as evolving from it.
###1601 Similarly, we can see how the pulp and paper industry might be able to evolve into bio
###1605 refineries. Maybe even the massive petroleum refineries can someday evolve to take biomass
###1610 materials, and you know we're doing some research in that area, as well.
###1614 It's really important that we stay on this track, because in the long run, there's no
###1618 other sustainable source of liquid transportation fuels other than biomass. So we have to succeed
###1624 at this.
###1624 THE PRESIDENT: You know, it's interesting, you're probably wondering whether or not automobiles
###1627 can be easily converted to use ethanol, and the answer is, absolutely. There's a lot of
###1633 automobiles in the Midwest that are filling up with 85 percent ethanol, called E85 pumps.
###1641 It doesn't take much. So one of the barriers to the advent of a lot of ethanol use is not
###1650 the automobile. It's easy to convert them. As a matter of fact, some of you out there
###1654 probably have got a car that can use ethanol and you just don't know it -- flex-fuel automobiles,
###1660 they're called.
###1661 Secondly, the production process. Once we figure out what needs to take place internally,
###1666 it's not that expensive, relative to huge gasoline refineries. What will happen is,
###1672 when you get a wood chip breakthrough, for example, where it becomes cost effective,
###1678 you're going to have ethanol production plants all across North Carolina, where the wood
###1684 chips can be gathered.
###1687 One of the reasons we keep talking about costs, it's just real practical. Somebody is not
###1691 going to fill up their car with ethanol if it costs a lot more than gasoline. The consumer
###1696 is pretty wise, and they care about the environment, no question about it. But if a person is having
###1704 to drive back and forth to work, they're going to generally pick the most economically competitive
###1711 fuel to do that. People want to keep money in their pocket, and therefore, if it costs
###1719 less using gasoline, they'll use it. So, therefore, that's why we're driving these research dollars,
###1723 to get the cost of producing ethanol down so it can compete. And it's going to happen,
###1730 because as that price of oil goes up, the price of gasoline goes up, which makes ethanol
###1734 more competitive. And one reason -- just so you know -- one reason why there's been such
###1738 a push, is because when the price of oil went up from early 2001 to where it is today, about
###1744 $60 a barrel, people saying, we may not be able to sustain this, we better get moving.
###1749 And that's what's happening.
###1751 North Carolina State. Ratna. Welcome. Thank you. You're a doctor of?
###1756 DR. SHARMA: Biological engineering.
###1758 THE PRESIDENT: Biological engineering. Chemical engineering. Biological engineering. (Laughter.)
###1768 People should be getting the picture that we've got a lot of smart people working on
###1773 this project. When you've got Ph.D.s surrounding the President talking about doing what's right,
###1778 we've got a lot of brain power working on it. And that's where you're going to get your
###1782 breakthroughs.
###1782 So what are you working on?
###1783 DR. SHARMA: Mr. President, first of all, I'd like to thank you for your support and interest
###1787 in the development of these technologies for cellulosic ethanol.
###1793 I essentially represent all the research of my colleagues at North Carolina State University
###1799 and across the country in different universities who have been working in this area of converting
###1805 residues from the farm, forest, animal operations, possibly even food industry waste to convert
###1813 it into ethanol and make our country self-reliant and achieve the goal of 20-in-10.
###1821 But, as has been mentioned, there are challenges. We have to overcome those, and it's possible
###1827 we can do that. We do need more investment and funding support, definitely, to speed
###1834 up this process of achieving this goal in 10 years.
###1837 THE PRESIDENT: So what do you think? I mean, how long have you been doing this for?
###1841 DR. SHARMA: I've been doing this for about four years.
###1843 THE PRESIDENT: Really? So when you got your Ph.D. you never dreamt you'd be thinking about
###1848 converting wood to oil for fuel. What did you feel?
###1852 DR. SHARMA: Well, I was trained as an agricultural engineer, and I grew up on -- on an ag university
###1857 campus with farms around me. So I always saw residues lying around and plants and stuff.
###1864 And I got my Ph.D. in food safety engineering where I learned about microorganisms. So then
###1870 I saw this opportunity, it was like putting together engineering and microbiology, to
###1876 process something and get value from something that's typically not --
###1880 THE PRESIDENT: And there are other people at North Carolina State working with you on
###1882 this project?
###1883 DR. SHARMA: Yes, there are. There are people working on utilizing forest residues, wood
###1889 chips for converting to ethanol. There are people working on different ag residues -- sweet
###1894 potatoes, which is a starch, base feedstock, people working on biodiesel, from -- again,
###1900 from agricultural resources.
###1903 So there are a lot of people working on overcoming the challenges of pretreatment and converting
###1907 the carbohydrates into sugars and then eventually fermenting it into ethanol. And my focus has
###1915 been more on ag residues, like cotton stalks, hays and straws, which would typically not
###1921 be --
###1921 THE PRESIDENT: Cotton stalks, pretty interesting, isn't it?
###1922 DR. SHARMA: They are.
###1923 THE PRESIDENT: They now get plowed up in the ground. Your idea is to get them so they can
###1930 end up in somebody's automobile, not in the ground.
###1931 DR. SHARMA: Exactly. So there is a lot of potential. And like switchgrass, which grows
###1936 in marginal lands. And we have, like you mentioned, a big swine industry in North Carolina. So
###1942 the advantage is we could possibly put the two together, use animal waste as a nutrient
###1948 source to grow the switchgrass and then convert it into ethanol so you're getting energy from
###1953 waste.
###1953 THE PRESIDENT: So are people pretty upbeat about it? People --
###1957 DR. SHARMA: Well, people who are aware and looking forward to switching from fossil fuels
###1964 to renewable energy, yes, they are.
###1966 THE PRESIDENT: Yes, pretty good.
###1968 DR. SHARMA: And they feel it's achievable. We can do it. We just need to work a little
###1972 harder on that.
###1973 THE PRESIDENT: Yes. A little more money and a little harder. (Laughter.) Talk to my man,
###1978 Michael. He's the guy distributing some of the money. (Laughter.) Well, good. Thanks,
###1983 Doc. Thanks for joining us. I'm sure proud you're here. NC State is a fine, fine institution.
###1984 I know you're proud to work there.
###1984 DR. SHARMA: Yes, I am, definitely.
###1985 THE PRESIDENT: Ryan, where are you from?
###1991 MR. ADOLPHSON: From the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia.
###1995 THE PRESIDENT: A bold man to come here to North Carolina. (Laughter.) A great school,
###1999 by the way. What do you do?
###2002 MR. ADOLPHSON: I'm with the university's -- I'm in charge of our bio -- our pilot facilities
###2008 that are looking into early transitioning some of this technology from the bench out
###2013 to industry, looking at really the wide, or broad spectrum of this concept of biomass
###2018 to energy that includes fuels and includes electrical and different bio products, and
###2024 really running the gamut of this whole type of industry. And we have a pretty large research
###2031 facility looking into this at all levels.
###2033 THE PRESIDENT: In Athens?
###2034 MR. ADOLPHSON: In Athens, yes -- bio-refining and carbon cycling center that we've recently
###2037 started in the last two years.
###2038 THE PRESIDENT: What is a bio -- what is a carbon recycling center?
###2041 MR. ADOLPHSON: Carbon cycling.
###2042 THE PRESIDENT: Carbon cycling.
###2043 MR. ADOLPHSON: Right. So we're looking into the concept of a bio refinery, which Mike
###2047 mentioned, and really taking a little bit bigger picture view, stepping back, not looking
###2051 only at ethanol, but counting ethanol as a significant piece to the puzzle, but looking
###2055 at all the other products that can be generated from bio mass. You know, similar to a petroleum
###2059 refinery that takes a barrel of crude and doesn't just make diesel and gasoline, but
###2063 50, 60 other products out of that.
###2065 So we're looking at our wood chips as that barrel of crude, taking that, and turning
###2069 it into a larger profit stream than just a single product, and we believe that's going
###2073 to drive the economics --
###2074 THE PRESIDENT: What other products?
###2074 MR. ADOLPHSON: There's a whole host of products. You know, the char, the stuff that's in a
###2078 thermochemical process, instead of a biological process, or the sugar platform. The Department
###2082 of Energy really breaks up when they talk about our production of ethanol in two pathways:
###2088 one is thermochemical and the other is our fermentation, or our sugar platform that we've
###2092 kind of been talking about now.
###2094 The thermochemical platform allows us to take all these different biomass streams, treat
###2098 them with heat in a certain way, release all of the energy from those, and we can capture
###2103 that, turn that into our product.
###2104 So one product we have left is the carbon that's left over. We're able to look at that
###2108 as a soil amendment and take that carbon without releasing it into the atmosphere and put it
###2112 back into the ground. And then we have everything that comes out of that biomass that we can
###2116 turn into ethanol and we can turn into specialty chemicals for our chemical industry as precursors
###2120 to things like nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, and then we have the gas that comes off that
###2125 could be maybe cleaned up and used as a pipeline-quality gas, like natural gas, to heat homes.
###2129 THE PRESIDENT: All from one big pile of wood chips?
###2131 MR. ADOLPHSON: All from one big pile of wood chips, right. You know, we're at a very unique
###2135 place --
###2135 THE PRESIDENT: You've got to dream big in order to be able to get it done. (Laughter.)
###2138 That's good.
###2138 MR. ADOLPHSON: We are at a unique place right now, and the technology is there.
###2142 THE PRESIDENT: Pretty interesting, isn't it? It's -- I'm not so sure if they'd believe
###2146 me in the coffee shop in Crawford if I told him what he just told me. (Laughter.) But
###2151 it's possible.
###2151 MR. ADOLPHSON: It is, right. I like to say, we're not there yet, but we can see it from
###2156 here.
###2156 THE PRESIDENT: You can, yes.
###2157 MR. ADOLPHSON: We've got two -- on the ground in the next 18 months in Georgia, we've got
###2161 a biorefinery taking wood chips to ethanol, we've got a traditional corn ethanol plant
###2166 going in, we've got two, what we call, integrated biorefineries that are going to be pulling
###2170 mostly -- we have 24 million acres of commercial forest in Georgia. So that's a big priority
###2176 for us. And the pulp and paper industry has been -- has been going other places.
###2180 THE PRESIDENT: Are they investing?
###2181 MR. ADOLPHSON: The industry itself?
###2182 THE PRESIDENT: Yes.
###2182 MR. ADOLPHSON: The part of the pulp and paper industry, that is the growers, the land owners,
###2187 are very interested in finding a market for their wood so they can get a higher price
###2191 for it. I think the paper mills might be less interested in paying a higher price for their
###2195 feed stock than the growers are. But yes, they're definitely investing. The University
###2199 and Governor Purdue has sent a mandate out for us to really invest in public/private
###2204 partnerships. So we can take the public money, and he likes to say he wants to see industry
###2208 with skin in the game, who is able to put money and people involved in this effort.
###2213 And so we're -- we've created a facility. We can locate industry on campus with us,
###2218 so that when we do develop a technology, this technology transfer from academia to industry
###2222 is seamless. We're excited about that because guys like us who are in academia or government,
###2227 we can provide money and resources, but it's going to be the market that will have to pick
###2230 it up and take it to get it into the consumers.
###2235 THE PRESIDENT: Absolutely, yes. That's pretty interesting, isn't it? Thanks for coming.
###2235 I'm glad you came over.
###2236 MR. ADOLPHSON: Thank you, Mr. President. We're excited to be here. Great opportunity.
###2239 THE PRESIDENT: And we're going to end up with Terry. Terry Ruse.
###2241 MR. RUSE: All of the Ph.D.s around the table. I don't have one of those, but I --
###2246 THE PRESIDENT: I'm glad to join you. (Laughter.)
###2249 MR. RUSE: I'm happy to report to you that the ethanol industry is alive and well and
###2255 up and taking nourishment.
###2257 THE PRESIDENT: So what do you do?
###2258 MR. RUSE: I am the Chief Operating Officer for Agri-Ethanol. That's a privately-held
###2263 ethanol company in Raleigh.
###2264 THE PRESIDENT: And what do you -- so what --
###2265 MR. RUSE: We are developing -- our strategic plan is to develop 10, 108-million-gallon-a-year
###2271 ethanol plants in the --
###2272 THE PRESIDENT: So you're going to be the manufacturer?
###2273 MR. RUSE: We are going to be the manufacturer. Thanks to the vision of Dave Brady and the
###2279 guys that own Agri-Ethanol, I've been able to develop a really flexible project in that
###2287 we have a design to start out as a corn plant to process corn. We were building 11,000 foot
###2293 of track -- big loop track to be able to bring corn in by rail and take ethanol back out.
###2299 In the center of that loop track, we've engineered the ability to handle wood chips. We've got
###2304 all that in place. We have a CO2 company that will process the CO2, anything -- any of the
###2312 CO2 that doesn't go to that direction to make food grade liquid carbon dioxide will be directed
###2318 into hydroponic gardening or into growing algae to support an adjacent biodiesel plant.
###2325 Now we have the real estate to put one of those on.
###2328 THE PRESIDENT: So you intend to buy the enzymes from this company to run in your plant --
###2332 MR. RUSE: We have this -- as a matter of fact, we have offered them the opportunity to establish
###2337 a field research laboratory on our site so that they don't have to go long distances
###2343 to get their people and do really ground work --
###2345 THE PRESIDENT: Where is this thing?
###2346 MR. RUSE: It's in Aurora, North Carolina. It's the first one. It's about 160 miles east
###2351 of Raleigh.
###2352 THE PRESIDENT: And when will you -- are you building it now?
###2356 MR. RUSE: We are ready to break ground. One of the interesting facts about that is that
###2362 we have the site completely controlled. We have it totally permitted. But in trying to
###2367 talk to the financial people about putting money, I've spent two years trying to convince
###2373 them that it makes sense to build an ethanol plant in North Carolina as much as it does
###2377 one in Iowa. And we haven't gotten that done. And so --
###2382 THE PRESIDENT: See, you can't build a plant far away from the raw material. That's the
###2385 interesting thing about this industry. What he's basically saying is, is that investors
###2391 think you have to be in the middle of a corn field. Really. And that's why there's a lot
###2396 of plants being built in the Midwest because there's a lot of corn in the Midwest.
###2400 MR. RUSE: But because of the fact we're closer to the population density centers for the
###2405 ethanol, and the animals that we have in North Carolina, we can prove that our plant is as
###2410 competitive as the plant in Iowa.
###2413 THE PRESIDENT: You can't have a centralized plant and ship your ethanol long distances,
###2418 either. The production needs to be close to the raw material and the users, is what you're
###2425 saying. And the economics.
###2427 MR. RUSE: That's exactly correct. And this -- each one of these plants will produce about
###2431 400,000 tons a year of highly digestible, high protein feed to help the hog farmers,
###2437 that you alluded to, get over their heart pain of --
###2439 THE PRESIDENT: High corn.
###2440 MR. RUSE: Of high corn. And coming from the farm, the thing that I understand most is
###2446 the resiliency of the American farmer. You give him a good price for the corn, and he
###2451 will grow the corn. And I think that when the March planning report comes out, you'll
###2457 see closer to 13 billion or 13.5 billion bushel corn market, and 90 million acres planted
###2464 than what we've seen in the past.
###2465 And so all of the price concerns from the animal growers and from the Wall Streeters
###2472 will be --
###2474 THE PRESIDENT: Will be eased somewhat. That's right. He's right. It's amazing how the market
###2476 responds.
###2476 MR. RUSE: And the one last piece of our project is that we intend to build a green truck stop
###2481 on each one of these sites that sells biodiesel, sell E10 and E85.
###2485 THE PRESIDENT: That would be good. E10 is ethanol -- 10 percent ethanol.
###2488 MR. RUSE: Ten percent ethanol and 85 percent ethanol and then biodiesel.
###2492 THE PRESIDENT: The purpose was to give everybody a sense of where a lot of smart people and
###2498 good capital are moving. Smart people are here working on some amazing technologies
###2505 that -- you know, that I believe 10 years from now people will say, gosh, it's interesting
###2509 that they were worried about this particular technology coming to fruition, because it's
###2515 coming to fruition. And the role of the government is to stimulate thought and investment and
###2522 set goals. And we set a big goal, really have -- reduction of gasoline by 20 percent over
###2529 the next 10 years.
###2530 I wouldn't have done that if I didn't think it was achievable. Part of it is to change
###2535 our CAFE standards on automobiles, which will encourage conservation. The other part is
###2540 to change the fuel -- fuel mix across America.
###2544 And this is a coming time. It really is. And I want to thank those of you who are on the
###2548 front line of changing it. It must be exciting for you to be able to work on something so
###2553 novel and so encouraging and so important for our country.
###2558 I thank the good folks at this important company for letting me come by to say hello. I ask
###2563 for God's blessings on the United States of America. Thank you. (Applause.)
