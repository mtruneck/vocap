0:0:0,864 --> 0:0:2,53
NINA TERRERO: Hey
guys, I'm Nina Terrero


3
0:0:2,53 --> 0:0:3,58
from "Entertainment Weekly."


4
0:0:3,58 --> 0:0:5,81
There are a ton of amazing,
high-quality web series


5
0:0:5,81 --> 0:0:7,3
out there right now,
so we've rounded up


6
0:0:7,3 --> 0:0:9,571
a few of our very favorites for
your binge watching pleasure.


7
0:0:9,571 --> 0:0:11,4
"Lonny" is a mockumentary
reality series,


8
0:0:11,4 --> 0:0:12,61
which sounds kind of normal.


9
0:0:12,61 --> 0:0:14,36
Except that in this
series, all we ever


10
0:0:14,36 --> 0:0:16,11
see are previews for
the upcoming episode.


11
0:0:16,11 --> 0:0:18,35
Each episode begins with
a calm, collected scene,


12
0:0:18,35 --> 0:0:20,597
and then it quickly escalates
into absurd hilarity.


13
0:0:20,597 --> 0:0:22,68
And the show is produced
by Ben Stiller's company.


14
0:0:22,68 --> 0:0:27,19



15
0:0:27,19 --> 0:0:30,12
NARRATOR: Next time,
on an all-new "Lonny."


16
0:0:30,12 --> 0:0:31,23
CHET: Holy [BLEEP], Lonny!


17
0:0:31,23 --> 0:0:31,816
What happened?


18
0:0:31,816 --> 0:0:32,899
LONNY: I think she's dead.


19
0:0:32,899 --> 0:0:33,55
CHET: What did you do, Lonny?


20
0:0:33,55 --> 0:0:34,295
What did you do?


21
0:0:34,295 --> 0:0:35,125
LONNY: I don't
know, some [BLEEP].


22
0:0:35,125 --> 0:0:36,269
CHET: This is really bad!


23
0:0:36,269 --> 0:0:37,56
LONNY: What are we going to do?


24
0:0:37,56 --> 0:0:38,45
CHET: We have to bury the body.


25
0:0:38,45 --> 0:0:40,14
NINA TERRERO: Season two
begins in just a couple weeks,


26
0:0:40,14 --> 0:0:41,806
so make sure to head
over to Nacho Punch


27
0:0:41,806 --> 0:0:44,0
to catch up on
all of season one.


28
0:0:44,0 --> 0:0:46,43
Felicia Day's channel Geek
& Sundry has been releasing


29
0:0:46,43 --> 0:0:47,94
a ton of super
cool stuff lately.


30
0:0:47,94 --> 0:0:50,81
This new series follows a
team of superhero roommates


31
0:0:50,81 --> 0:0:53,36
who turn to crime after falling
on some pretty hard times.


32
0:0:53,36 --> 0:0:56,8
It's got some big name
actors like Harry Shum, Jr.


33
0:0:56,8 --> 0:0:58,31
from "Glee" and Abby
Miller from "Justified."


34
0:0:58,31 --> 0:0:59,851
PENNY BLUE: I just--
actually, I just


35
0:0:59,851 --> 0:1:3,545
walked out of a job interview,
so-- [EXPLOSION] Dad,


36
0:1:3,545 --> 0:1:4,23
I've got to go.


37
0:1:4,23 --> 0:1:9,241



38
0:1:9,241 --> 0:1:11,24
NINA TERRERO: The show
looks great, so make sure


39
0:1:11,24 --> 0:1:13,292
you check it out
every Wednesday.


40
0:1:13,292 --> 0:1:15,75
The ladies of "#hotmessmoves"
are on a mission to celebrate


41
0:1:15,75 --> 0:1:17,85
the super spazzy, ridiculous
lives of the average


42
0:1:17,85 --> 0:1:20,5
20-something, from
overly dramatic picnics--


43
0:1:20,5 --> 0:1:22,6
LYLE: You are beautiful,
and you are a great friend.


44
0:1:22,6 --> 0:1:25,565
And I just sometimes have
to tell you how I feel


45
0:1:25,565 --> 0:1:28,634
and get it off my chest, and I
just think I should be allowed.


46
0:1:28,634 --> 0:1:31,5
NINA TERRERO: --to lying about
your emotional dysfunction.


47
0:1:31,5 --> 0:1:31,84
ASHLEY: Where are
you going, girl?


48
0:1:31,84 --> 0:1:32,25
LYLE: Nowhere.


49
0:1:32,25 --> 0:1:33,16
ASHLEY: What, are you
going to go to the gym?


50
0:1:33,16 --> 0:1:33,59
LYLE: No.


51
0:1:33,59 --> 0:1:34,72
ASHLEY: Are you going on a date?


52
0:1:34,72 --> 0:1:35,16
LYLE: No.


53
0:1:35,16 --> 0:1:36,48
ASHLEY: You going to
go visit your mom?


54
0:1:36,48 --> 0:1:36,92
LYLE: No.


55
0:1:36,92 --> 0:1:38,6
NINA TERRERO: They've only
been around for five months,


56
0:1:38,6 --> 0:1:40,85
but they've already developed
a huge cult following.


57
0:1:40,85 --> 0:1:41,51
The best part?


58
0:1:41,51 --> 0:1:44,0
You can watch two new
episodes every single week.


59
0:1:44,0 --> 0:1:46,52

LONNY: No, no, I don't--

0:1:56,67 --> 0:1:58,46
CHET: He said it'd sure
be swell if Carolyn died,


67
0:1:58,46 --> 0:2:0,47
because then I could
be your new girlfriend.

DOG: You should kill him, Chet.


73
0:2:6,531 --> 0:4:6,531
CHET: Sure thing, dog moon.
