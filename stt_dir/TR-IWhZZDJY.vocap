###3 From the fires of a sun’s birth, twin planets emerged.
###10 Venus and Earth.
###13 Two roads diverged in our young solar system. Nature draped one world in the greens and
###27 blues of life.
###30 While enveloping the other in acid clouds, high heat, and volcanic flows.
###39 Why did Venus take such a disastrous turn?
###46 And what light can Earth’s sister planet shed on the search for other worlds like our
###51 own?
###65 For as long as we have gazed upon the stars, they have offered few signs that somewhere
###71 out there are worlds as rich and diverse as our own.
###77 Recently, though, astronomers have found ways to see into the bright lights of nearby stars.
###84 They’ve been discovering planets at a rapid clip, using orbiting observatories like NASA’s
###91 Kepler space telescope, and an array of ground-based instruments. The count is almost a thousand
###101 and rising.
###107 These alien worlds run the gamut, from great gas giants many times the size of our Jupiter,
###115 to rocky, charred remnants that burned when their parent star exploded.
###123 Some have wild elliptical orbits, swinging far out into space, then diving into scorching
###129 stellar winds.
###137 Still others orbit so close to their parent stars that their surfaces are likely bathed
###142 in molten rock.
###159 Amid these hostile realms, a few bear tantalizing hints of water or ice, ingredients needed
###165 to nurture life as we know it.
###172 The race to find other Earths has raised anew the ancient question, whether, out in the
###179 folds of our galaxy, planets like our own are abundant, and life commonplace?
###187 Or whether Earth is a rare Garden of Eden in a barren universe?
###194 With so little direct evidence of these other worlds to go on, we have only the stories
###199 of planets within our own solar system to gauge the chances of finding another Earth.
###205 Consider, for example, a world that has long had the look and feel of a life-bearing planet.
###213 Except for the moon, there’s no brighter light in our night skies than the planet Venus,
###219 known as both the morning and the evening star.
###224 The ancient Romans named it for their goddess of beauty and love.
###228 In time, the master painters transformed this classical symbol into an erotic figure, then
###237 a courtesan.
###239 It was a scientist, Galileo Galilei, who demystified planet Venus, charting its phases as it moved
###247 around the sun, drawing it into the ranks of the other planets.
###252 With a similar size and weight, Venus became known as Earth’s sister planet. But how
###258 Earth-like is it?
###262 The Russian scientist Mikkhail Lomonosov caught a tantalizing hint in 1761. As Venus passed
###270 in front of the Sun, he witnessed a hair thin luminescence on its edge.
###275 Venus, he found, has an atmosphere.
###279 Later observations revealed a thick layer of clouds. Astronomers imagined they were
###284 made of water vapor, like those on Earth. Did they obscure stormy, wet conditions below?
###292 And did anyone, or anything, live there? The answer came aboard an unlikely messenger,
###302 an asteroid that crashed into Earth.
###306 That is, according to the classic sci-fi adventure, “The First Spaceship on Venus.“ A mysterious computer disk is found among the
###326 rubble.
###331 With anticipation rising on Earth, an international crew sets off to find out who sent it, and
###342 why.
###343 What they find is a treacherous, toxic world.
###353 No wonder the Venusians want to switch planets.
###363 It was now time to get serious about exploring our sister planet.
###371 NASA sent Mariner 2 to Venus in 1962, in the first-ever close planetary encounter.
###380 Its instruments showed that Venus is nothing at all like Earth. Rather, it’s extremely
###385 hot, with an atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide.
###391 The data showed that Venus rotates very slowly, only once every 243 Earth days, and it goes
###399 in the opposite direction.
###404 American and Soviet scientists found out just how strange Venus is when they sent a series
###410 of landers down to take direct readings.
###414 Surface temperatures are almost 900 degrees Fahrenheit, hot enough to melt lead, with
###420 the air pressure 90 times higher than at sea level on Earth.
###425 The air is so thick that it’s not a gas, but a “supercritical fluid.” Liquid CO2.
###433 On our planet, the only naturally occurring source is in the high-temperature, high-pressure
###439 environments of undersea volcanoes.
###446 The Soviet Venera landers sent back pictures showing that Venus is a vast garden of rock,
###453 with no water in sight.
###457 In fact, if you were to smooth out the surface of Venus, all the water in the atmosphere
###461 would be just 3 centimeters deep.
###466 Compare that to Earth, where the oceans would form a layer 3 kilometers deep.
###478 If you could land on Venus, you’d be treated to tranquil vistas and sunset skies, painted
###483 in orange hues.
###484 The winds are light, only a few miles per hour, but the air is so thick that a breeze
###491 would knock you over.
###494 Look up and you’d see fast-moving clouds, streaking around the planet at 300 kilometers
###500 per hour. These clouds form a dense high-altitude layer, from 45 to 66 kilometers above the
###508 surface.
###510 The clouds are so dense and reflective that Venus absorbs much less solar energy than
###516 Earth, even though it’s 30% closer to the Sun.
###520 These clouds curve around into a pair of immense planetary hurricanes as the air spirals down
###527 into the cooler polar regions.
###533 Along the equator, they rise in powerful storms, unleashing bolts of lightning.
###539 Just like earth, these storms produce rain, only it’s acid rain that evaporates before
###545 it hits the ground.
###550 At higher elevations, a fine mist forms, not of water but of the rare metal tellurium,
###557 and iron pyrites, known as fool’s gold.
###563 It can form a metallic frost, like snowflakes in hell.
###574 Scientists have identified around 1700 major volcanic centers on Venus ranging from lava
###579 domes, and strange features called arachnoids or coronae, to giant volcanic summits.
###587 The planet is peppered with volcanoes, perhaps in the millions, distributed randomly on its
###595 surface. Venus is run through with huge cuts thousands of kilometers long that may well
###601 be lava channels.
###604 Our sister planet is a volcanic paradise, in a solar system shaped by volcanism.
###612 The largest mountain on Earth, Hawaii’s Mauna Kea volcano, measures 32,000 feet from
###618 sea floor to summit.
###622 Rising almost three times higher is the mother of all volcanoes: Olympus Mons on Mars.
###629 Jupiter’s moon Io, is bleeding lava. It’s produced deep underground by the friction
###636 of rock on rock, caused by the gravitational pull of its mother planet.
###641 Then there’s Neptune’s moon Triton, with crystals of nitrogen ice shooting some 10
###648 kilometers above the surface.
###650 Saturn’s moon Titan, with frozen liquid methane and ammonia oozing into lakes and
###658 swamps.
###660 On our planet, volcanoes commonly form at the margins of continents and oceans. Here,
###668 the vast slabs of rock that underlie the oceans push beneath those that bear the continents.
###677 Deep underground, magma mixes with water, and the rising pressure forces it up in explosive
###684 eruptions.
###686 On Venus, the scene is very different. In the high-density atmosphere, volcanoes are
###696 more likely to ooze and splatter, sending rivers of lava flowing down onto the lowlands.
###705 They resemble volcanoes that form at hot spots like the Hawaiian islands. There, plumes of
###712 magma rise up from deep within the earth, releasing the pressure in a stream of eruptions.
###724 To see a typical large volcano on Venus, go to Sappas Mons, at 400 kilometers across and
###731 1.5 kilometers high.
###733 The mountain was likely built through eruptions at its summit. But as magma reached up from
###739 below, it began to drain out through subsurface tubes or cracks that formed a web of channels
###745 leading onto the surrounding terrain.
###750 Is Venus, like Earth, still volcanically active?
###755 Finding the answer is a major goal of the Venus Express mission, launched in 2005 by
###760 the European Space Agency. Armed with a new generation of high-tech sensors, it peered
###768 through the clouds.
###770 Recording the infrared light given off by several large mountains, it found that the
###775 summits are brighter than the surrounding basins. That’s probably because they had
###779 not been subject to as much weathering in this corrosive environment.
###785 This means that they would have erupted sometime within the last few hundred thousand years.
###793 If these volcanoes are active now, it’s because they are part of a deeper process
###798 that shapes our planet as well.
###805 On Earth, the release of heat from radioactive decay deep in its mantle is what drives the
###810 motion of oceanic and continental plates.
###814 It’s dependent on erosion and other processes associated with water.
###823 With no water on Venus, the planet’s internal heat builds to extreme levels, then escapes
###829 in outbreaks of volcanism that may be global in scope.
###834 This may explain why fewer than a thousand impact craters have been found on Venus. Anything
###839 older than about 500 million years has literally been paved over.
###847 So why did Venus diverge so radically from Earth when it was born in same solar system
###852 and under similar circumstances?
###856 There is growing evidence, still circumstantial, that Venus may in fact have had a wetter,
###861 more Earth-like past.
###864 One of the most startling findings of the early Venus missions was the presence of deuterium,
###872 a form of hydrogen, in Venus’ upper atmosphere. It forms when ultraviolet sunlight breaks
###880 apart water molecules.
###883 Additional evidence recently came to light. Venus Express trained its infrared sensors
###888 on the planet’s night side, to look at how the terrain emits the energy captured in the
###894 heat of the day.
###898 This picture is a composite of over a thousand individual images of Venus’ southern hemisphere.
###905 Higher elevation areas, shown in blue, emit less heat than the surrounding basins.
###911 That supports a hypothesis that these areas are made not of lava, but of granite.
###920 On Earth, granite forms in volcanoes when magma mixes with water. If there’s granite
###926 on Venus, then there may well have been water.
###935 If Earth and Venus emerged together as twin blue marbles, then at some point, the two
###940 worlds parted company.
###946 Earth developed ways to moderate its climate, in part by removing carbon dioxide, a greenhouse
###952 gas, from its atmos phere.
###956 Plants, for one, absorb CO2 and release oxygen in photosynthesis. One square kilometer of
###965 tropical jungle, for example, can take in several hundred tons of co2 in just a year.
###973 That’s nothing compared to the oceans. In a year’s time, according to one recent study,
###979 just one square kilometer of ocean can absorb 41 million tons of CO2.
###986 Earth takes in its own share of CO2. When rainfall interacts with rocks, a chemical
###992 reaction known as “weathering” converts atmospheric CO2 to carbonate compounds. Runoff
###1003 from the land washes it into rivers and the seas, where they settle into ocean sediments.
###1015 With little water and no oceans, Venus has no good way to remove CO2 from its atmosphere.
###1022 Instead, with volcanic eruptions adding more and more CO2 to the atmosphere, it has trapped
###1028 more and more of the sun’s heat in a runaway greenhouse effect.
###1037 Venus is so hot that liquid water simply cannot survive on the surface.
###1042 Nor, it seems, can it last in the upper atmosphere.
###1052 The culprit is the Sun. The outer reaches of its atmosphere, the corona, is made up
###1060 of plasma heated to over a million degrees Celsius. From this region, the sun sends a
###1070 steady stream of charged particles racing out into the solar system.
###1078 The solar wind reaches its peak in the wake of great looping eruptions on the surface
###1083 of the Sun, called coronal mass ejections.
###1102 The blast wave sweeps by Venus, then heads out toward Earth.
###1128 Our planet is fortified against the solar blast.
###1142 Plumes of hot magma rise and fall in Earth’s core as it spins, generating a magnetic field
###1149 that extends far out into space.
###1152 It acts as a shield, deflecting the solar wind and causing it to flow past.
###1158 It’s this protective bubble that Venus lacks.
###1165 Venus Express found that these solar winds are steadily stripping off lighter molecules
###1170 of hydrogen and oxygen. They escape the planet on the night side, then ride solar breezes
###1177 on out into space.
###1180 All this may be due to Venus’ size, 80% that of Earth. This prevents the formation
###1188 of a solid iron core, and with it the rising and falling plumes that generate a strong
###1193 magnetic field.
###1198 There may be another reason too, according to a theory about the planet’s early years.
###1204 A young planet Venus encountered one or more planet-sized objects, in violent collisions.
###1212 The force of these impacts slowed its rotation to a crawl, and reversed it, reducing the
###1221 chances that a magnetic field could take hold.
###1226 This theory may have a surprising bearing on Earth’s own history.
###1234 Scientists believe the sun was not always as hot as it is. In fact, going back several
###1244 billion years, it was cool enough that Earth should have been frozen over.
###1254 Because it was not, this is known as the faint young sun paradox.
###1261 Earth’s salvation may well be linked to Venus’ fate.
###1270 The idea is that the Earth occupied an orbit closer to the Sun, allowing it to capture
###1276 more heat. The gravity of two smaller planets with unstable orbits would have gradually
###1285 pushed it out to its present orbit. The pair would eventually come together, merging to
###1293 form the Venus we know.
###1301 As dead as Venus is today, it has brought surprising dividends in the search for life.
###1311 On its recent crossing between Earth and the Sun, astronomers were out in force.
###1317 In remote locations where the viewing was optimal, such as the Svalbard islands north
###1322 of Norway. The data gathered here would be added to that collected by solar telescopes
###1331 on the ground and in space.
###1340 To object for most was to experience a spectacle that will not occur again till the year 2117.
###1366 It was also to capture sunlight passing through Venus’ atmosphere.
###1373 Today, the Kepler Space Telescope is searching for planets around distant stars by detecting
###1382 dips in their light as a planet passes in front.
###1390 Telescopes in the future may be able to analyze the light of the planet itself. If elements
###1396 such as carbon or oxygen are detected, then these worlds may well be “Earth-like.”
###1406 Venus provides a benchmark, and some valuable perspective.
###1414 So what can we glean from the evolution of planet Venus?
###1420 As we continue to scan the cosmic horizons, the story of Venus will stand as a stark reminder.
###1429 It takes more than just the right size, composition, and distance from the parent star, for a planet
###1437 to become truly Earth-like.
###1445 No matter how promising a planet may be, there are myriad forces out there that can radically
###1451 alter its course.
###1453 For here was a world, Venus, poised perhaps on the brink of a glorious future.
###1463 But bad luck passed its way. Now, we can only imagine what might have become of Earth’s
###1473 sister planet?
