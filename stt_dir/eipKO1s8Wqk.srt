1
0:0:5,687 --> 0:0:7,767
How's he doing?


2
0:0:7,767 --> 0:0:11,847
He has neutropenic fever.
His white blood cell count's stabilised.


3
0:0:11,847 --> 0:0:14,447
He's not getting any worse.


4
0:0:14,447 --> 0:0:16,687
- How you feeling, Jared?
- OK, l guess.


5
0:0:16,687 --> 0:0:19,447
l heard your dad arranged
for a visit from The Rock?


6
0:0:19,447 --> 0:0:22,767
l'm 1 3, l must love wrestling, right?


7
0:0:22,767 --> 0:0:24,967
Come on, The Rock's a movie star.


8
0:0:24,967 --> 0:0:28,647
What could a guy
possibly wanna see more?


9
0:0:28,647 --> 0:0:31,967
Guys, we need an answer.


10
0:0:31,967 --> 0:0:35,927
Name one thing guys wanna see
more than anything in the world?


11
0:0:35,927 --> 0:0:39,967
Louie, we're gonna go with boobs.


12
0:0:39,967 --> 0:0:41,727
Show me boobs.


13
0:0:41,727 --> 0:0:43,767
There they are.


14
0:0:43,767 --> 0:0:46,927
Good job!


15
0:0:46,927 --> 0:0:50,207
l wanna see 'em on a real girl.
A cute girl.


16
0:0:50,207 --> 0:1:9,967
You're cute.


17
0:1:9,967 --> 0:1:13,447
<i>The janitor,</i>
<i>This guy is always bothering me,</i>


18
0:1:13,447 --> 0:1:17,727
<i>Don't look at him</i>
<i>don't talk to him don't,,,</i>


19
0:1:17,727 --> 0:1:20,927
What's your point?
Ammonia too strong?


20
0:1:20,927 --> 0:1:23,567
- No, l have a...
- That's one.


21
0:1:23,567 --> 0:1:25,287
Keep pushin'.


22
0:1:25,287 --> 0:1:27,367
Hey, sport. Got your page.


23
0:1:27,367 --> 0:1:30,287
This better be good.
Paging the Chief of Medicine.


24
0:1:30,287 --> 0:1:38,447
<i>Dr Steadman, Resident</i>
<i>and first-class teacher's pet,</i>


25
0:1:38,447 --> 0:1:42,47
Sir, l was going over
Mr Martinez's chart,


26
0:1:42,47 --> 0:1:46,607
and it seems the TlPS procedure
he's scheduled for is unnecessary.


27
0:1:46,607 --> 0:1:48,647
Why unnecessary?


28
0:1:48,647 --> 0:1:52,87
He's dead.


29
0:1:52,87 --> 0:1:56,287
Excellent catch, Dr...


30
0:1:56,287 --> 0:1:57,967
Dr...


31
0:1:57,967 --> 0:2:0,287
<i>Dorian! You see me every day,</i>


32
0:2:0,287 --> 0:2:2,967
- <i>Say my name, Say it!</i>
- Martinez.


33
0:2:2,967 --> 0:2:5,247
That was the name
of the patient, sir.


34
0:2:5,247 --> 0:2:8,647
- Avery.
- That's the clipboard manufacturer.


35
0:2:8,647 --> 0:2:13,207
- Fine work, doctor. Fine work.
- <i>I hear that,</i>


36
0:2:13,207 --> 0:2:17,927
Ammonia's a little strong today.


37
0:2:17,927 --> 0:2:22,847
That's two.


38
0:2:22,847 --> 0:2:25,727
Steady, boy.


39
0:2:25,727 --> 0:2:29,767
Now, Rowdy.


40
0:2:29,767 --> 0:2:33,7
- When you're not here, he does it.
- l'm sure. He's shy.


41
0:2:33,7 --> 0:2:35,727
l think you should go ahead
and do it.


42
0:2:35,727 --> 0:2:38,487
- l am not flashing my breasts.
- lt's easy.


43
0:2:38,487 --> 0:2:42,567
- You just go like this.
- That's hot.


44
0:2:42,567 --> 0:2:46,447
l went by paediatrics.


45
0:2:46,447 --> 0:2:52,767
- They thought it was funny.
- l'm borrowing a sweatshirt.


46
0:2:52,767 --> 0:2:55,807
What did we agree you would do
whenever l left a room?


47
0:2:55,807 --> 0:3:5,367
- l'm sorry, baby.
- That's better.


48
0:3:5,367 --> 0:3:8,967
My man Turk is getting it daily,
nightly and ever-so-rightly.


49
0:3:8,967 --> 0:3:11,47
What up, dawg!


50
0:3:11,47 --> 0:3:14,127
<i>Once every 4,2 seconds</i>
<i>a man says something stupid</i>


51
0:3:14,127 --> 0:3:19,487
<i>that a woman hears and punishes him for,</i>
<i>This wasn't one of those times,</i>


52
0:3:19,487 --> 0:3:21,727
What did you just say?


53
0:3:21,727 --> 0:3:23,447
What up, dawg?


54
0:3:23,447 --> 0:3:25,927
Why would you think we'd slept together?


55
0:3:25,927 --> 0:3:28,207
Because l'm a nurse?
Because l'm Latina?


56
0:3:28,207 --> 0:3:30,967
Because you guys
have been dating for a while.


57
0:3:30,967 --> 0:3:35,247
Do Latina women put out more?
That's not something l've heard.


58
0:3:35,247 --> 0:3:38,687
- Turk told me.
- No! l didn't! He assumed.


59
0:3:38,687 --> 0:3:40,767
And did you correct him?


60
0:3:40,767 --> 0:3:45,207
l've been really busy
at the hospital lately.


61
0:3:45,207 --> 0:3:49,647
ls that how you see this relationship?
As some mad dash to the finish line?


62
0:3:49,647 --> 0:3:52,247
l'll take you into that bedroom now


63
0:3:52,247 --> 0:3:55,527
and you will be walking sideways
for the rest of your life,


64
0:3:55,527 --> 0:3:59,967
because l will have used all your up
and down. Now, is that what you want?


65
0:3:59,967 --> 0:4:1,727
- No.
- Good.


66
0:4:1,727 --> 0:4:5,647
Because what l want is for this
to be a real relationship.


67
0:4:5,647 --> 0:4:8,927
l want us to know each other
better than we know ourselves.


68
0:4:8,927 --> 0:4:11,647
- Wow.
- That's right, ''wow''.


69
0:4:11,647 --> 0:4:16,87
So if you really want me ''daily and
nightly and ever-so-rightly'',...


70
0:4:16,87 --> 0:4:18,207
That sounds like
something you'd say.


71
0:4:18,207 --> 0:4:22,807
...show me you know me.


72
0:4:22,807 --> 0:4:25,687
l think you should
let the kid meet the ladies.


73
0:4:25,687 --> 0:4:29,567
You're the one who told
Kelso that Mr Martinez was dead?


74
0:4:29,567 --> 0:4:33,487
- That's terrific work.
- <i>Looks like word gets around,</i>


75
0:4:33,487 --> 0:4:37,927
What in the name of <i>Are You There God?</i>
<i>It's Me Margaret</i> were you thinking?


76
0:4:37,927 --> 0:4:43,447
l'm certain invasive vascular procedures
have a low success rate on dead people.


77
0:4:43,447 --> 0:4:47,727
That TlPS procedure
was for Mrs Blitt down in 1 03.


78
0:4:47,727 --> 0:4:50,247
You see, she doesn't have insurance.


79
0:4:50,247 --> 0:4:53,7
But Mr Martinez had great insurance.


80
0:4:53,7 --> 0:4:56,367
Should l talk slower or get a nurse
who speaks fluent Moron?


81
0:4:56,367 --> 0:5:15,687
- You don't have to be mean about it.
- What do you want from me?


82
0:5:15,687 --> 0:5:19,687
l don't know if they taught you this
in the land of puppy-dog tails


83
0:5:19,687 --> 0:5:23,647
where you obviously, if not grew up,
then spent most of your summers,


84
0:5:23,647 --> 0:5:30,327
but you're in the real world now.


85
0:5:30,327 --> 0:5:32,727
- <i>Don't say it,</i>
- l still think l was right.


86
0:5:32,727 --> 0:5:35,767
<i>Once every 6,3 seconds</i>
<i>a man says something stupid</i>


87
0:5:35,767 --> 0:5:39,647
<i>that another man hears and punishes</i>
<i>him for, Luckily this wasn't,,,</i>


88
0:5:39,647 --> 0:5:41,727
- That's it!
- <i>Oh no,</i>


89
0:5:41,727 --> 0:5:46,287
Do you know what this is?
This is me washing my hands of you.


90
0:5:46,287 --> 0:5:50,727
l will not be in the same room
with you again, starting...


91
0:5:50,727 --> 0:6:2,527
now.


92
0:6:2,527 --> 0:6:3,887
Tissue?


93
0:6:3,887 --> 0:6:5,287
<i>It's a challenge,,,</i>


94
0:6:5,287 --> 0:6:7,247
<i>Little bit of flow like,,,</i>


95
0:6:7,247 --> 0:6:12,967
<i>''Fighting Joe'' Hooker,,,</i>


96
0:6:12,967 --> 0:6:16,7
<i>I don't need Dr Cox, Big jerk,</i>


97
0:6:16,7 --> 0:6:20,527
<i>I hate him,</i>


98
0:6:20,527 --> 0:6:24,767
Hey, sport.
Or should l say howdy, Mr Pouty?


99
0:6:24,767 --> 0:6:26,487
lt's been a rough day.


100
0:6:26,487 --> 0:6:31,407
So l hear. Well, anyway,
l'm very proud of you, Dr...


101
0:6:31,407 --> 0:6:33,487
<i>Just look at my badge,</i>


102
0:6:33,487 --> 0:6:34,887
Dr Turk.


103
0:6:34,887 --> 0:6:38,327
This is my roommate's badge.
We must have switched...


104
0:6:38,327 --> 0:6:42,487
That's a great anecdote. You should
write that down in your journal.


105
0:6:42,487 --> 0:6:45,567
Then your kids can read about it
when you're dead.


106
0:6:45,567 --> 0:6:47,727
- They're waiting for us...
- ln a moment.


107
0:6:47,727 --> 0:6:52,727
lf you go easy on the stories, l'd love
you to join me for golf tomorrow.


108
0:6:52,727 --> 0:7:5,287
- That'd be terrific, sir.
- Super.


109
0:7:5,287 --> 0:7:9,207
You wanna show a woman you know her,
buy her a little something.


110
0:7:9,207 --> 0:7:11,927
None of my patients are improving.


111
0:7:11,927 --> 0:7:14,967
- l'm gonna buy her flowers.
- Yeah!


112
0:7:14,967 --> 0:7:17,527
Please, been done to death.


113
0:7:17,527 --> 0:7:20,807
l don't get it.
l do everything by the book.


114
0:7:20,807 --> 0:7:24,567
Maybe that's the problem.
You approach things too clinically.


115
0:7:24,567 --> 0:7:26,887
How about chocolates?


116
0:7:26,887 --> 0:7:29,247
With rich clichÃ© centres?


117
0:7:29,247 --> 0:7:31,807
Have you ever treated your patients


118
0:7:31,807 --> 0:7:35,407
with something other
than traditional medicine?


119
0:7:35,407 --> 0:7:38,567
l'm gonna buy her a really nice pen.


120
0:7:38,567 --> 0:7:42,7
No, she loves to write.
She handwrites all of her letters


121
0:7:42,7 --> 0:7:46,647
because she says e-mail's
too impersonal. That's perfect.


122
0:7:46,647 --> 0:7:53,127
- A pen is good.
- Yeah!


123
0:7:53,127 --> 0:7:57,887
All l gotta do is find time to get
out of here and maybe l'll buy her one.


124
0:7:57,887 --> 0:8:2,407
All l'm saying is there's more
to healing than what's in the books.


125
0:8:2,407 --> 0:8:7,447
l talk to my patients. l sing
to them, ask what their hobbies are,


126
0:8:7,447 --> 0:8:12,567
and tell them ghost stories
about an old sea captain.


127
0:8:12,567 --> 0:8:19,527
Thought you'd be interested
in that kid Jared's chart.


128
0:8:19,527 --> 0:8:21,647
Look at that white blood cell count.


129
0:8:21,647 --> 0:8:24,487
And all it took
was a visit from The Rock.


130
0:8:24,487 --> 0:8:26,847
The Rock was here
and nobody told me?


131
0:8:26,847 --> 0:8:36,7
- The Rock couldn't make it.
- Well, somebody did something.


132
0:8:36,7 --> 0:8:40,167
<i>It felt weird knowing Dr Cox and I would</i>
<i>never be working in the same room again,</i>


133
0:8:40,167 --> 0:8:41,807
Check her LFTs and coags.


134
0:8:41,807 --> 0:8:44,687
<i>Every time I think something</i>
<i>the opposite happens,</i>


135
0:8:44,687 --> 0:8:46,727
<i>I'm not having sex this weekend,</i>


136
0:8:46,727 --> 0:8:50,727
You're cute.


137
0:8:50,727 --> 0:8:52,487
Who's the present from?


138
0:8:52,487 --> 0:8:55,767
- My boyfriend.
- When did he give it to you?


139
0:8:55,767 --> 0:9:0,487
<i>He's pretending yesterday didn't happen,</i>
<i>If he thinks I'll forgive him,,,</i>


140
0:9:0,487 --> 0:9:3,207
The reason l was
bent out of shape yesterday...


141
0:9:3,207 --> 0:9:7,127
- l accept!
- Don't interrupt me. Come here.


142
0:9:7,127 --> 0:9:10,127
Pull that curtain.


143
0:9:10,127 --> 0:9:13,847
Mrs Blitt over there needs
the TlPS procedure, no insurance.


144
0:9:13,847 --> 0:9:16,47
She can now look forward
to a lifetime


145
0:9:16,47 --> 0:9:20,207
of encephalopathy and jaundice
thanks to Bottom-Line Bob.


146
0:9:20,207 --> 0:9:23,927
- ls he really that bad?
- l hate Robert Kelso.


147
0:9:23,927 --> 0:9:28,47
l hate his family, friends, the guy
that cleans his racist lawn jockey.


148
0:9:28,47 --> 0:9:33,967
l hate anybody who even associates
with him. ls that clear?


149
0:9:33,967 --> 0:9:38,927
Totally.


150
0:9:38,927 --> 0:9:41,367
Call me.


151
0:9:41,367 --> 0:9:44,127
Elliot, check out these ass slides.


152
0:9:44,127 --> 0:9:48,287
How's that stuff even get up there?


153
0:9:48,287 --> 0:9:49,647
l fell on it.


154
0:9:49,647 --> 0:9:51,47
l fell on it.


155
0:9:51,47 --> 0:9:52,367
l fell on it.


156
0:9:52,367 --> 0:9:54,927
l was bored.


157
0:9:54,927 --> 0:9:58,887
The doctors in the ER have a box
where they keep all this junk.


158
0:9:58,887 --> 0:10:3,967
- Next to the Lost and Found Box?
- There's no Lost and Found Box.


159
0:10:3,967 --> 0:10:7,207
There's an Ass Box.


160
0:10:7,207 --> 0:10:20,127
- That's not Carla's pen?
- l had no time to shop!


161
0:10:20,127 --> 0:10:22,967
Beautiful day for golf, sports?


162
0:10:22,967 --> 0:10:25,647
Yes, sir, Dr Kelso.


163
0:10:25,647 --> 0:10:30,167
l don't know what you're trying to pull,
but l am not a guy you wanna mess with.


164
0:10:30,167 --> 0:10:32,167
Steadman, l need a tee.


165
0:10:32,167 --> 0:10:35,127
A tee, or some tea, sir?
Because l've brought both.


166
0:10:35,127 --> 0:10:39,47
<i>It's just a friendly game of golf</i>
<i>with a couple of guys from work,</i>


167
0:10:39,47 --> 0:10:42,847
Excellent, our fourth has arrived.


168
0:10:42,847 --> 0:10:57,847
What's up, Newbie?


169
0:10:57,847 --> 0:11:1,407
<i>He's got nothing to say,</i>
<i>After all he's here too,</i>


170
0:11:1,407 --> 0:11:4,447
- l thought you hated Kelso.
- l do.


171
0:11:4,447 --> 0:11:7,327
And watching his face
as l kick his worthless butt


172
0:11:7,327 --> 0:11:11,487
up and down this golf course every week,
is basically...


173
0:11:11,487 --> 0:11:16,327
lt's the most fun l can have
without having to cuddle afterwards.


174
0:11:16,327 --> 0:11:19,647
Good night, lrene!
Fantastic golf shot, sir.


175
0:11:19,647 --> 0:11:24,247
Real nice length.
Now, does your husband happen to play?


176
0:11:24,247 --> 0:11:27,207
But, no,
l'm not a hypocrite for being here.


177
0:11:27,207 --> 0:11:31,727
What's your pathetic excuse,
you whiny little suck-up?


178
0:11:31,727 --> 0:11:39,487
<i>Ignore him,</i>
<i>Just let your game do all the talking,</i>


179
0:11:39,487 --> 0:11:47,687
That'll play.


180
0:11:47,687 --> 0:11:51,567
Don't open it!
Please, don't open it!


181
0:11:51,567 --> 0:12:1,527
Since we've been chatting, maybe you
could raise your heart rate for me?


182
0:12:1,527 --> 0:12:24,687
What am l doing? This is stupid.


183
0:12:24,687 --> 0:12:29,687
Don't make her open it.


184
0:12:29,687 --> 0:12:31,487
Are you that busy?


185
0:12:31,487 --> 0:12:37,87
You do know me.
Sweetie, l love this!


186
0:12:37,87 --> 0:12:39,967
lt's so, it's so cool. lt's cool.


187
0:12:39,967 --> 0:12:43,487
- l'm woozy.
- You're fine.


188
0:12:43,487 --> 0:12:46,927
Today's the day l finally beat
his uppity, insubordinate...


189
0:12:46,927 --> 0:12:49,767
Great shot, doctor!


190
0:12:49,767 --> 0:12:53,167
You see, l always say
keep your friends close


191
0:12:53,167 --> 0:12:57,407
and your enemies closer.


192
0:12:57,407 --> 0:13:0,607
Can you believe him?
You're away and yet he hit first.


193
0:13:0,607 --> 0:13:3,327
- lt's a technicality.
- But there's the rub.


194
0:13:3,327 --> 0:13:5,447
The rules are there for a reason.


195
0:13:5,447 --> 0:13:20,207
lf you break one,
why not break them all?


196
0:13:20,207 --> 0:13:22,887
Before medicine ever became a business,


197
0:13:22,887 --> 0:13:26,407
the only rule
was to do your best to help the patient.


198
0:13:26,407 --> 0:13:28,967
Like it or not,
medicine is a business.


199
0:13:28,967 --> 0:13:33,607
lf the hospital shuts down,
then who are we helping then?


200
0:13:33,607 --> 0:13:38,167
So, only people with money
deserve medical treatment?


201
0:13:38,167 --> 0:13:39,687
Dammit!


202
0:13:39,687 --> 0:13:44,327
lt's about what's best for the hospital.


203
0:13:44,327 --> 0:13:55,7
lt's about what's best for the patient.


204
0:13:55,7 --> 0:13:58,287
The only reason l go back
to that hospital day after day


205
0:13:58,287 --> 0:14:1,447
is because l care
about those patients.


206
0:14:1,447 --> 0:14:5,527
Every one of 'em.


207
0:14:5,527 --> 0:14:8,327
You've got a lot of potential, sport.


208
0:14:8,327 --> 0:14:10,727
You stick with me


209
0:14:10,727 --> 0:14:14,407
and you're going to be climbing
the ladder very quickly.


210
0:14:14,407 --> 0:14:18,207
lsn't that what you want?


211
0:14:18,207 --> 0:14:20,687
You have to sink this
for the win, Cox.


212
0:14:20,687 --> 0:14:22,767
Newbie, l almost forgot.


213
0:14:22,767 --> 0:14:26,87
l'm gonna get Mrs Blitt
her TlPS procedure tomorrow,


214
0:14:26,87 --> 0:14:30,247
with or without insurance,
and l want you to help me.


215
0:14:30,247 --> 0:14:43,807
Now tell me, do you have the stones
to sink a putt when you have to?


216
0:14:43,807 --> 0:14:48,287
See you next Wednesday.


217
0:14:48,287 --> 0:14:50,407
l love this game.


218
0:14:50,407 --> 0:14:53,327
l can't decide if l should help Cox.


219
0:14:53,327 --> 0:14:57,607
At least you didn't give your girlfriend
a gift that used to be inside someone.


220
0:14:57,607 --> 0:15:0,287
That's true.


221
0:15:0,287 --> 0:15:4,727
l have magic breasts.


222
0:15:4,727 --> 0:15:8,527
How many has she had?


223
0:15:8,527 --> 0:15:10,567
Almost one.


224
0:15:10,567 --> 0:15:12,847
You know what,
Cox doesn't need your help


225
0:15:12,847 --> 0:15:16,7
taking her down
for a TlPS procedure.


226
0:15:16,7 --> 0:15:19,127
He shouldn't even be
putting you in that situation.


227
0:15:19,127 --> 0:15:21,767
- You're right.
- Hell, yeah, l'm right!


228
0:15:21,767 --> 0:15:24,607
Screw Cox.


229
0:15:24,607 --> 0:15:28,207
- Not afraid of him, are you?
- Hell, no!


230
0:15:28,207 --> 0:15:33,207
<i>Maybe a little,</i>


231
0:15:33,207 --> 0:15:35,567
- That's four.
- That's three.


232
0:15:35,567 --> 0:15:40,287
That's five.


233
0:15:40,287 --> 0:15:42,687
All righty, we're through here.


234
0:15:42,687 --> 0:15:48,927
- Somebody call it.
- Wait.


235
0:15:48,927 --> 0:15:56,967
Right. Time of death, 6.20.


236
0:15:56,967 --> 0:16:0,247
Hey. There's my buppy.


237
0:16:0,247 --> 0:16:2,527
Did you just say ''buppy''?


238
0:16:2,527 --> 0:16:6,207
Cos that's not gonna work for me.


239
0:16:6,207 --> 0:16:9,847
Carla, we gotta talk.


240
0:16:9,847 --> 0:16:13,847
We can talk later.


241
0:16:13,847 --> 0:16:16,447
Later's good.


242
0:16:16,447 --> 0:16:20,847
Let's just worry about
getting you better. OK, gorgeous?


243
0:16:20,847 --> 0:16:22,927
<i>I decided Cox was wrong,</i>


244
0:16:22,927 --> 0:16:26,967
<i>There's room to play by the rules</i>
<i>and care about the patients,</i>


245
0:16:26,967 --> 0:16:31,87
Do a wallet biopsy on her, and
if the insurance doesn't check out,


246
0:16:31,87 --> 0:16:35,727
l want her in the nursing home before
she can gum down a single fruit cup.


247
0:16:35,727 --> 0:16:42,607
<i>That was when I realised</i>
<i>how Dr Kelso truly saw these people,</i>


248
0:16:42,607 --> 0:16:45,727
<i>Could I have a price check</i>
<i>on a 7 4-year-old female</i>


249
0:16:45,727 --> 0:16:47,807
<i>with prerenal azotemia?</i>


250
0:16:47,807 --> 0:16:55,7
Bag her.


251
0:16:55,7 --> 0:16:57,127
Come on,
l wanna show you something.


252
0:16:57,127 --> 0:16:59,687
Wait. lt's about the pen.


253
0:16:59,687 --> 0:17:2,487
l thought a really nice one
would be a great gift,


254
0:17:2,487 --> 0:17:6,727
and l see a great one...
in the Lost and Found Box.


255
0:17:6,727 --> 0:17:10,447
There is no Lost and Found Box.
There's an Ass Box...


256
0:17:10,447 --> 0:17:17,647
Yeah, there is.


257
0:17:17,647 --> 0:17:21,167
And you were this close
to getting everything you wanted.


258
0:17:21,167 --> 0:17:23,407
l assume this is what you wanted.


259
0:17:23,407 --> 0:17:24,807
Yes.


260
0:17:24,807 --> 0:17:28,207
And yet you tell me
that your thoughtful token of love


261
0:17:28,207 --> 0:17:32,567
wasn't a token of love at all.
lt was an ass pen.


262
0:17:32,567 --> 0:17:36,447
You come home and tell me this
because being open and honest


263
0:17:36,447 --> 0:17:43,967
is more important to you
than having sex with me?


264
0:17:43,967 --> 0:17:46,807
Are you coming or what?


265
0:17:46,807 --> 0:17:55,207
Hell, yeah.


266
0:17:55,207 --> 0:17:57,127
Stay, Rowdy, stay.


267
0:17:57,127 --> 0:17:59,367
lt took me three hours to realise...


268
0:17:59,367 --> 0:18:1,527
- Excuse me, miss.
- Can l help you?


269
0:18:1,527 --> 0:18:7,47
l'm afraid l have an awful case
of the gotta-see-'ems.


270
0:18:7,47 --> 0:18:9,247
That's not even a real disease.


271
0:18:9,247 --> 0:18:11,647
At what point
did l become a crazy person?


272
0:18:11,647 --> 0:18:14,447
Come on.
Yes, exposing yourself to a dead guy


273
0:18:14,447 --> 0:18:16,527
might have been a tad unorthodox,


274
0:18:16,527 --> 0:18:20,367
and it might be hard to live down.


275
0:18:20,367 --> 0:18:23,407
- l'm waiting for the ''but''.
- So's everyone else.


276
0:18:23,407 --> 0:18:25,7
That's not funny.


277
0:18:25,7 --> 0:18:28,167
- Thanks. Glad l shared.
- Come on.


278
0:18:28,167 --> 0:18:30,607
When l look at you, l look at a doctor


279
0:18:30,607 --> 0:18:33,247
who will do whatever it takes
to help a patient.


280
0:18:33,247 --> 0:18:35,47
- Really?
- Yeah, really.


281
0:18:35,47 --> 0:18:37,7
<i>And on that note,,,</i>


282
0:18:37,7 --> 0:18:39,127
lf you still want my help,
l'm on board.


283
0:18:39,127 --> 0:18:41,927
lt's way too big of a risk for a peon.


284
0:18:41,927 --> 0:18:44,847
l just wanted to see
what team you were playing for.


285
0:18:44,847 --> 0:18:48,167
- <i>So it was all a test,</i>
- Besides,


286
0:18:48,167 --> 0:18:51,607
- l already did it.
- Cox!


287
0:18:51,607 --> 0:18:55,207
Run, Junior. Daddy's home.


288
0:18:55,207 --> 0:18:58,607
Did you think
l wouldn't find out what you did?


289
0:18:58,607 --> 0:19:0,607
- What did l do?
- You insolent...


290
0:19:0,607 --> 0:19:1,807
l'm insolent?


291
0:19:1,807 --> 0:19:5,847
<i>I know it sounds melodramatic</i>
<i>but as I watched the two of them</i>


292
0:19:5,847 --> 0:19:10,847
<i>they weren't battling for patients</i>
<i>or insurance but for my soul,</i>


293
0:19:10,847 --> 0:19:13,487
- She needed the TlPS...
- l've got you this time.


294
0:19:13,487 --> 0:19:15,207
l can taste it!


295
0:19:15,207 --> 0:19:20,247
<i>It's an old story really,</i>
<i>Good versus bad, Right versus wrong,</i>


296
0:19:20,247 --> 0:19:28,7
<i>The dark side versus the light,</i>


297
0:19:28,7 --> 0:19:40,327
l've been waiting
for this moment all my life.


298
0:19:40,327 --> 0:19:46,927
Easy, Chewie.


299
0:19:46,927 --> 0:19:51,47
l'll teach you
to respect this institution.


300
0:19:51,47 --> 0:19:55,687
l hope you learn from this.


301
0:19:55,687 --> 0:20:0,487
No!


302
0:20:0,487 --> 0:20:10,767
You're suspended.
Effective immediately.


303
0:20:10,767 --> 0:20:15,727
Well, sport. lt looks like
a permanent spot just opened up


304
0:20:15,727 --> 0:20:17,647
on the golf course.


305
0:20:17,647 --> 0:20:21,207
How does joining the Chief of Medicine
for a weekly round sound?


306
0:20:21,207 --> 0:20:23,367
l'm not really that into golf.


307
0:20:23,367 --> 0:20:29,647
l guess that's your choice,
isn't it, Dr Dorian?


308
0:20:29,647 --> 0:20:34,567
<i>I liked it better</i>
<i>when he didn't know my name,</i>


309
0:20:34,567 --> 0:20:42,207
That's one for me.


310
0:20:42,207 --> 0:20:43,287
That's two.


311
0:20:43,287 --> 0:22:43,287
l'm hurt.
