BRYAN TSCHORN: The first two
turns are pretty icy.


23
0:0:59,637 --> 0:1:3,334
And then after you go over the
first lip, the next two gates


24
0:1:3,334 --> 0:1:4,74
are super icy.


25
0:1:4,74 --> 0:1:7,689
So if you can just make it
though those two turns and


26
0:1:7,689 --> 0:1:10,57
then speed and then try to take
a little off and then


27
0:1:10,57 --> 0:1:12,4
send it over the jump.

I didn't qualify
for the event.

in the Open.

BOB KLEIN: The Open is kind of
like a reunion for all the old

0:1:34,834 --> 0:1:38,51
school guys, but it's more like,
hey, let's go hang out


38
0:1:38,51 --> 0:1:40,29
on the deck and drink
a beer together or


39
0:1:40,29 --> 0:1:42,15
take a few runs together.

in and just throw down and

SETH MILLER: When I think of
the US Open, definitely it


47
0:2:6,302 --> 0:2:8,0
helped launch my career.


48
0:2:8,0 --> 0:2:12,36
We were living here, just really
nobodies, until we made


49
0:2:12,36 --> 0:2:13,58
it through the finals
at the US Open.


50
0:2:13,58 --> 0:2:17,73
And all of the sudden, I'm on
a plane to Europe, and I'm


51
0:2:17,73 --> 0:2:19,31
traveling the world and
doing the World Cup.


52
0:2:19,31 --> 0:2:21,35
And all of the sudden,
it just happened.


53
0:2:21,35 --> 0:2:25,115
And I think that's what the US
Open did for a lot of guys.

GUILLAUME MORISSET: 1997
was my first year


56
0:2:30,86 --> 0:2:32,55
doing whatever contest.


57
0:2:32,55 --> 0:2:34,5
I'd just started there.


58
0:2:34,5 --> 0:2:39,166
And then I came back 1998
and 1999 and 2000.


59
0:2:39,166 --> 0:2:42,554
And 2000 is the one year
that I won it.


60
0:2:42,554 --> 0:2:46,505
Well, there is so much
adrenaline, so it's just so


61
0:2:46,505 --> 0:2:49,41
fun to be here riding with tough
riders like Hakonsen and


62
0:2:49,41 --> 0:2:50,33

63
0:2:50,33 --> 0:2:51,55

contest ever.

0:2:53,91 --> 0:2:54,59
I'm so stoked.


66
0:2:54,59 --> 0:2:56,38
The pipe was just perfect.


67
0:2:56,38 --> 0:2:59,7
And 2000 was the first year they
brought this superpipe,


68
0:2:59,7 --> 0:3:1,46
which was 18 feet.


69
0:3:1,46 --> 0:3:3,42
Now, it would not be a
superpipe anymore.


70
0:3:3,42 --> 0:3:7,12
But then, it was
something new.


71
0:3:7,12 --> 0:3:11,95
LIAM GRIFFIN: It was 15-foot
pipe, or I guess hand-dug pipe


72
0:3:11,95 --> 0:3:13,88
and then Lyle with
the excavator--


73
0:3:13,88 --> 0:3:18,62
and then 12-foot, 15-foot,
18-foot, 22-foot.


74
0:3:18,62 --> 0:3:22,75
And I mean, the pipes got
bigger, people went bigger.


75
0:3:22,75 --> 0:3:24,82
The pipes got better,
people rode better.


76
0:3:24,82 --> 0:3:26,24
But that's the thing.


77
0:3:26,24 --> 0:3:29,55
You build this stuff wondering
if it's going to be possible,


78
0:3:29,55 --> 0:3:31,254
and then you put the right
people on it and


79
0:3:31,254 --> 0:3:33,44
just watch it happen.


80
0:3:33,44 --> 0:3:38,54
ANDY COHGLAN: Now, it seems like
you just expect that, and


81
0:3:38,54 --> 0:3:41,63
you expect them to go 15 or
20 feet up in the air.


82
0:3:41,63 --> 0:3:44,99
But back then, it was
something that


83
0:3:44,99 --> 0:3:46,23
no one could do.


84
0:3:46,23 --> 0:3:47,82
And I guess it's the
same way now.


85
0:3:47,82 --> 0:3:50,39
You look at it with awe because
it's something that


86
0:3:50,39 --> 0:3:52,128
you can't do.

and snowboarding.


90

91
0:4:2,8 --> 0:4:3,21

with my homies


92
0:4:3,21 --> 0:4:4,22
and go ride a half-pipe.


93

BOB KLEIN: In '92, I saw a van
careening up the access road,


94
0:4:10,9 --> 0:4:11,94
and I was like, hey,
that's Palmer.


95
0:4:11,94 --> 0:4:14,79
And we caught up to him and
started racing back and forth.


96
0:4:14,79 --> 0:4:18,7
And we clipped the back end of
his van, and it rolled right


97
0:4:18,7 --> 0:4:18,72
in front of me.


98
0:4:18,72 --> 0:4:20,2
And I freaked out.


99
0:4:20,2 --> 0:4:22,64
It was Palmer and Noah Salasnek
and I thought they


100
0:4:22,64 --> 0:4:24,77
were dead, totally dead.


101
0:4:24,77 --> 0:4:27,31
And I ran back to the house
we were all staying in.


102
0:4:27,31 --> 0:4:31,52
And 15, 20 minutes later,
everybody comes in the house,


103
0:4:31,52 --> 0:4:34,51
and Palmer and Salasnek look
like they had glitter all over


104
0:4:34,51 --> 0:4:36,97
their faces from all
the broken glass--


105
0:4:36,97 --> 0:4:38,39
not a scratch on them.


106
0:4:38,39 --> 0:4:40,6

they thought it was the


107
0:4:40,6 --> 0:4:41,79
funniest thing ever.

good this year.

You're going because
it's the Open.

JACK MITRANI: I mean

117
0:5:8,71 --> 0:5:13,11

it's cool to grow with the

good memories.

to do good here, because

0:5:21,55 --> 0:5:22,72
it's the Open.


123
0:5:22,72 --> 0:5:24,6
It's prestigious.

ABE TETER: Having that energy
in the crowd to back you,


125
0:5:28,11 --> 0:5:30,82
you'll drop into the half-pipe
10 times faster than you


126
0:5:30,82 --> 0:5:31,64
normally would.


127
0:5:31,64 --> 0:5:33,43

129
0:5:34,77 --> 0:5:35,83
it's funny--


130
0:5:35,83 --> 0:5:39,15
they used to say, I met my
wife at the US Open, and


131
0:5:39,15 --> 0:5:41,38
they're a third-generation
snowboarder now.


132
0:5:41,38 --> 0:5:44,86
So this dude snowboarded.


133
0:5:44,86 --> 0:5:46,3
He met some broad there.


134
0:5:46,3 --> 0:5:49,7
And then they had kids, and now
their kids are riding in


135
0:5:49,7 --> 0:5:49,85
the US Open.


136
0:5:49,85 --> 0:5:53,81
So there's this progression
now that's pretty amazing.


137
0:5:53,81 --> 0:5:56,41
And the Open has spawned
a lot more than


138
0:5:56,41 --> 0:5:58,75
