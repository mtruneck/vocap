1
0:0:4,19 --> 0:0:9,35
Your true wealth is your time and freedom.  Money is just a tool for trading your time.


2
0:0:9,35 --> 0:0:13,83
It's a container to store your economic energy until you're ready to deploy it.


3
0:0:13,83 --> 0:0:19,64
But the whole world has been turned away from real money and has been fooled into using currency, -


4
0:0:19,64 --> 0:0:24,7
a deceiptful imposter that is silently stealing your two most valuable assets.


5
0:0:24,7 --> 0:0:32,55
Your time and your freedom.  Welcome to the rabbit hole.


6
0:0:32,55 --> 0:0:37,86
We are entering a period of financial crisis that is the greatest the world has ever known.


7
0:0:37,86 --> 0:0:44,4
The wealth transfer that will take place during this decade is the greatest wealth transfer in history.


8
0:0:44,4 --> 0:0:47,5
Wealth is never destroyed.  It is merely transferred.


9
0:0:47,5 --> 0:0:52,52
And that means that on the opposite side of every crisis there is an opportunity.


10
0:0:52,52 --> 0:1:0,8
The great news is that all you have to do to turn this crisis into your great opportunity is to educate yourself.


11
0:1:0,8 --> 0:1:7,3
I believe that the best investment that you can make in your lifetime is your own education.


12
0:1:7,3 --> 0:1:9,53
Education on the history of money.


13
0:1:9,53 --> 0:1:14,55
Education on finance.  Education on how the global economy works.


14
0:1:14,55 --> 0:1:22,21
Education on how all of these guys, the central bankers, the stock market, how they can cheat you.  How they can scam you.


15
0:1:22,21 --> 0:1:32,9
If you learn what is going on and how the financial world works, you can put yourself on the correct side of this wealth transfer.


16
0:1:32,9 --> 0:1:38,1
Winston Churchill once said that the further you look into the past, the further that you can see into the future.


17
0:1:38,1 --> 0:1:42,23
This program is all about creating your own crystal ball.


18
0:1:42,23 --> 0:1:44,66
Being able to gaze into the future.


19
0:1:44,66 --> 0:2:6,46
Being able to change this crisis, the greatest crisis in the history of mankind, into your great opportunity.


20
0:2:6,46 --> 0:2:10,3
The hidden secrets of money.  Some of them are hidden in plain sight.


21
0:2:10,3 --> 0:2:12,3
They're like right in front of you.


22
0:2:12,3 --> 0:2:18,7
Uh, the way the monetary system works is something that isn't actually hidden away from all of us.


23
0:2:18,7 --> 0:2:24,42
It's out in the open, but it's complex and people just don't, they can't see how it works.


24
0:2:24,42 --> 0:2:29,37
It's hard for them to imagine that we're living in such a hoax.


25
0:2:29,37 --> 0:2:33,64
Others are meant to be secret, but the truth is slowly coming out.


26
0:2:33,64 --> 0:2:40,2
Like the Federal Reserve being a private corporation and not really part of the U.S. Government.


27
0:2:40,2 --> 0:2:49,73
But when I started studying this, uh, what I found was that there was no place that I could point people to where they could get it all in one spot.


28
0:2:49,73 --> 0:2:59,7
And so I basically decided to write my book about it and consolidate monetary history, economics, the markets, uh, the fundamentals of gold and silver.


29
0:2:59,7 --> 0:3:16,24
There's a lot of smoke and mirrors in economics, and I've sort of made it my job to lift the fog for people.


30
0:3:16,24 --> 0:3:20,0
Welcome to Egypt.  This is where it all began.


31
0:3:20,0 --> 0:3:26,64
Roughly 5,000 years ago, the Egyptians started using gold and silver as their predominant form of currency,-


32
0:3:26,64 --> 0:3:28,9
but it was not yet money.


33
0:3:28,9 --> 0:3:35,2
The pieces of gold and silver that they were using were odd sizes and weights.  Odd purities.


34
0:3:35,2 --> 0:3:43,26
So it still was not interchangable where each unit is the same as the next.  This meant that nothing really had a price yet.


35
0:3:43,26 --> 0:3:51,9
You couldn't put a price of so many coins on something because they didn't have coins yet.  Trade was still difficult.


36
0:3:51,9 --> 0:3:56,73
It was still a guessing game when it came to the exchange of values.


37
0:3:56,73 --> 0:4:6,98
One of the reasons that we are in the financial mess that we are today globally is that people do not understand the difference between currency and money.


38
0:4:6,98 --> 0:4:16,3
Currency is a medium of exchange, a unit of account.  It is portable, durable, divisible, and something called fungible.


39
0:4:16,3 --> 0:4:20,15
Fungible means that each unit is the same as the next unit.


40
0:4:20,15 --> 0:4:24,29
A dollar in my pocket buys the same amount as a dollar in your pocket.


41
0:4:24,29 --> 0:4:31,36
Money is all of those things plus a store of value over a long period of time.


42
0:4:31,36 --> 0:4:39,3
Even financial planners, bankers, your accountant, they don't understand the difference between currency and money.


43
0:4:39,3 --> 0:4:47,14
The currency in your pocket is a medium of exchange.  It's a unit of account because it's got numbers on it.


44
0:4:47,14 --> 0:4:53,66
It's somewhat durable, it's portable, it's divisible in that you can make change, and it's fungible.


45
0:4:53,66 --> 0:4:57,28
A dollar in my pocket buys the same amount as a dollar in your pocket.


46
0:4:57,28 --> 0:5:4,68
But because governments can print more and more and more of it and dilute the currency supply,-


47
0:5:4,68 --> 0:5:13,24
it's continually transferring wealth out of your pocket, out of your bank account to the government and to the banking system.


48
0:5:13,24 --> 0:5:19,9
The reason that gold and silver are the optimum form of money is because of their properties.


49
0:5:19,9 --> 0:5:27,1
It's an easy medium of exchange because gold and silver store a large amount of value in a very small area.


50
0:5:27,1 --> 0:5:32,6
It's a unit of account.  Pure gold has the same value all over the planet.


51
0:5:32,6 --> 0:5:39,61
So an ounce of gold buys the same amount here in Egypt as it would in China or in the United States.


52
0:5:39,61 --> 0:5:47,25
It's durable.  The same gold that Egyptians were using in trade 5,000 years ago is still here with us today.


53
0:5:47,25 --> 0:5:50,0
It does not corrode.  It's divisible.


54
0:5:50,0 --> 0:5:53,45
You can make change with it.  It's very portable.


55
0:5:53,45 --> 0:6:0,6
You can use something like oil as money.  It's just that you can't carry around a barrel of oil on your back.


56
0:6:0,6 --> 0:6:5,2
It's fungible.  Pure gold is the same wherever it is on earth.


57
0:6:5,2 --> 0:6:9,6
Pure silver is the same wherever it is on earth.  It's limited in quantity.


58
0:6:9,6 --> 0:6:14,4
That's the  reason that it maintains its purchasing power.  Governments cannot print it.


59
0:6:14,4 --> 0:6:20,2
Over the last 5,000 years, only gold and silver have maintained their purchasing power.


60
0:6:20,2 --> 0:6:23,8
There have been thousands upon thousands of fiat currencies.


61
0:6:23,8 --> 0:6:33,5
Currencies that are unbacked by gold or silver, and they have all gone to zero.  It's a 100 percent failure rate.


62
0:6:33,5 --> 0:6:42,35
Well, fiat currency, of course, is um, a currency that is, exists at the dictate or by fiat from, from a government.


63
0:6:42,35 --> 0:6:47,6
They have their printing presses, and the paper money rolls off the printing presses.


64
0:6:47,6 --> 0:6:52,6
And then they give it the fiat designation which then makes the currency official.


65
0:6:52,6 --> 0:6:58,1
It's just worthless paper, but when Ben Bernake gives it the special sign, and they have the cult meeting -


66
0:6:58,1 --> 0:7:3,7
at the Federal Open Market Committee meetings, it suddenly becomes currency.


67
0:7:3,7 --> 0:7:8,7
If you look at what's really going on it's, it's a con game.  And so there's confidence.


68
0:7:8,7 --> 0:7:12,7
Well, the Federal Reserve is very forthright about what they're doing.


69
0:7:12,7 --> 0:7:15,6
If you read their website they'll tell you it's a confidence game.


70
0:7:15,6 --> 0:7:19,28
They tell that there's no intrinsic value in their money.


71
0:7:19,28 --> 0:7:22,9
They'll tell you that they print it backed by absolutely nothing.


72
0:7:22,9 --> 0:7:25,5
They actually display all these facts.


73
0:7:25,5 --> 0:7:31,58
But if you tell somebody in the public that this stuff is created out of thin air, there's no backing whatsover -


74
0:7:31,58 --> 0:7:38,4
, it's absolutely worthless, it's about as valuable as Monopoly money, they'll look at you like you're nuts.


75
0:7:38,4 --> 0:7:46,2
Is there an example throughout history of a fiat currency, a piece of paper that's unbacked by anything, surviving?


76
0:7:46,2 --> 0:7:48,5
Short answer, no.


77
0:7:48,5 --> 0:7:52,2
Long answer, no.  And here's why.


78
0:7:52,2 --> 0:7:55,38
When Addison Wiggin took over at The Daily Reckoning, they got cranked up.


79
0:7:55,38 --> 0:8:1,7
Uh, Bill Bonner asked him to catalogue all of the fiat currencies throughout history and what happened to each of them.


80
0:8:1,7 --> 0:8:11,2
Addison dutifully went to work.  Within a short period of time he had gone through the alphabet.  All the fiat currencies that started with the letter A were done.


81
0:8:11,2 --> 0:8:16,88
They all went to zero.  He was halfway through the letter B and all the fiat currencies that started with the letter B,-


82
0:8:16,88 --> 0:8:22,9
and there were 600 of them in just the first letter and a half of the alphabet.


83
0:8:22,9 --> 0:8:30,2
And every single one of them went to zero.  Every one.


84
0:8:30,2 --> 0:8:38,81
600 fiat currencies that start with the letter A, and half of the ones that start with the letter B, there are 600 of these things.


85
0:8:38,81 --> 0:8:41,5
Not one ever came close.


86
0:8:41,5 --> 0:8:47,7
And you think this one, the United States dollar is gonna be the first one after all that?  I don't think so.


87
0:8:47,7 --> 0:8:50,7
No.  No currency, fiat currency has ever survived.


88
0:8:50,7 --> 0:8:56,0
None.


89
0:8:56,0 --> 0:9:0,0
The thing about money is there actually is a fairly well accepted definition of what money is.


90
0:9:0,0 --> 0:9:7,1
The question is as you apply that definition to particular things that are, people claim to be money, do they fit the definition?


91
0:9:7,1 --> 0:9:10,5
Well just take the paper dollar for example.  How well does it perform those functions?


92
0:9:10,5 --> 0:9:18,27
Will it store a value?  Uh, the dollar has lost 95 percent of its purchasing power, uh, since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913.


93
0:9:18,27 --> 0:9:20,5
So not very good as a store of value.


94
0:9:20,5 --> 0:9:26,5
One of the things I do is, uh, just a way to get the audience's attention is I have a slide and there are three pictures on the slide.


95
0:9:26,5 --> 0:9:30,64
One is a pile of Monopoly money.  The other one is a pile of Federal Reserve notes.


96
0:9:30,64 --> 0:9:33,1
Uh, what Americans would call paper money.


97
0:9:33,1 --> 0:9:37,44
Uh, the other one is a solid gold, uh, American Eagle, uh, one ounce coin.


98
0:9:37,44 --> 0:9:40,76
And the title of this slide is which of these is not like the other.


99
0:9:40,76 --> 0:9:46,2
And if you know the show Sesame Street or if you have children who watch it, it's one of the favorite vignettes in Sesame Street.


100
0:9:46,2 --> 0:9:49,32
And what it really is is a kind of IQ test for five year olds.


101
0:9:49,32 --> 0:9:53,6
They're supposed to look at the three things and look at characteristics and find the one that's not like the other.


102
0:9:53,6 --> 0:10:1,82
Well, I've shown this slide to, um, groups of, you know, Ivy League university professors, and I've also shown it to, uh, you know, uh, children.


103
0:10:1,82 --> 0:10:4,78
You know, kind of find results in my nieces and newphews and so forth.


104
0:10:4,78 --> 0:10:11,32
Uh, and when the, uh, professors look at it they say well, um, clearly the, uh, the dollars are not like the others -


105
0:10:11,32 --> 0:10:16,8
'cause gold has no role as money and Monopoly money is junk and the American dollar is a store of value.


106
0:10:16,8 --> 0:10:21,4
So that's not like the other.  But the children look at it and they say well, the gold coin is not like the other -


107
0:10:21,4 --> 0:10:25,6
because the other two are just piles of paper, and the gold coin is clearly something different.


108
0:10:25,6 --> 0:10:31,25
So my question to the audience is who's smarter?  A five year old or an Ivy League professor?


109
0:10:31,25 --> 0:10:39,75
Before World War I, each note that a treasury issued would say that there has been deposited with the United States Treasury -


110
0:10:39,75 --> 0:10:43,94
20 dollars in gold coin payable to the bearer upon demand.


111
0:10:43,94 --> 0:10:49,51
The money was in the vault.  The currency was a note they gave you that was a claim check.


112
0:10:49,51 --> 0:10:58,13
Only a claim check on the money.  The same as if you go to the dry cleaners and you give them your shirt and they give you a claim check for your shirt.


113
0:10:58,13 --> 0:11:4,43
The value is, is that shirt at the dry cleaners.  Not the piece of paper that says that you own that shirt.


114
0:11:4,43 --> 0:11:13,1
So our currency that's circulated was the paper U.S. dollars and they were claim checks on money.


115
0:11:13,1 --> 0:11:17,31
The next hidden secret is the difference between currency and money.


116
0:11:17,31 --> 0:11:23,77
Money must be a store of value and maintain its purchasing power over long periods of time.


117
0:11:23,77 --> 0:11:29,39
As we progress through this series, you'll learn that national currencies are really a tool used by the government -


118
0:11:29,39 --> 0:11:36,1
and the financial sector to leach away your time and your freedom by stealing your purchasing power.


119
0:11:36,1 --> 0:11:41,5
So rather than storing your economic energy, currencies leak.


120
0:11:41,5 --> 0:11:44,9
Now compare that to the gold and silver the Egyptians were using.  Like I started with, it still wasn't money because it wasn't interchangable yet.


121
0:11:44,9 --> 0:11:50,0
Like I started with, it still wasn't money because it wasn't interchangable yet.


122
0:11:50,0 --> 0:11:58,2
But they were on the right track as gold and silver have proven over thousands of years to be the ultimate store of value.


123
0:11:58,2 --> 0:12:5,2
Gold is only formed when a star explodes, a supernova.  And it stays around forever.


124
0:12:5,2 --> 0:12:16,35
This is one of the properties that make it the ultimate money.


125
0:12:16,35 --> 0:12:22,58
You know, people are amazed that after 5,000 years the pyramids are still here.


126
0:12:22,58 --> 0:12:28,26
But what I'm more amazed at is that the currency that the people that built this were using,-


127
0:12:28,26 --> 0:12:35,6
that currency, that gold and silver that they were using in trade on a daily basis, is still around today.


128
0:12:35,6 --> 0:12:42,61
It may have been melted down and re-refined and it's in a coin or a bar or in some piece of jewelry.


129
0:12:42,61 --> 0:12:49,1
But it's still with us today and it still purchases something.


130
0:12:49,1 --> 0:12:54,99
Yes, it is the ultimate money because there is nothing else even in the same league.  It's divisible.


131
0:12:54,99 --> 0:12:58,4
It's permanent.  It's a store of value.


132
0:12:58,4 --> 0:13:8,3
It's, uh, a unit of account.  It's got everything you want out of money, but it doesn't go away and it can't be increased.


133
0:13:8,3 --> 0:13:15,74
That is what makes gold the most beautiful money of all.  What more can you ask out of a money?


134
0:13:15,74 --> 0:13:20,17
It keeps governments under control.  You can maintain a solvent system.


135
0:13:20,17 --> 0:13:29,6
Governments don't like gold at present because they're getting away with the fiat currencies, and they'll do everything they can to discredit it as an asset class.


136
0:13:29,6 --> 0:13:36,43
I mean, my goodness.  Gold has, uh, outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average in each of the last seven years.


137
0:13:36,43 --> 0:13:41,1
Uh, yet it's not considered a legitimate asset class.  Why?


138
0:13:41,1 --> 0:13:45,2
Again, it's the fear that maybe gold will be imposed on the system.


139
0:13:45,2 --> 0:13:50,12
That it will constrain government ability to spend beyond its means.


140
0:13:50,12 --> 0:13:51,19
They can't print it.


141
0:13:51,19 --> 0:13:53,6
They can't print it, no.


142
0:13:53,6 --> 0:14:1,8
The proper definition of inflation, I use Milton Friedman's definition.  Inflation is an expansion of the currency supply.


143
0:14:1,8 --> 0:14:10,4
Deflation is a contraction of the currency supply.  If you expand the currency supply, eventually prices will rise.


144
0:14:10,4 --> 0:14:17,3
And if you contract the currency supply, eventually prices will fall.


145
0:14:17,3 --> 0:14:20,4
This is a pool.  But it's not a pool of water.


146
0:14:20,4 --> 0:14:24,54
This is a, the currency pool.  And these are prices.


147
0:14:24,54 --> 0:14:32,6
And if you expand the currency supply, prices like a sponge in water have to rise to suck up the excess currency.


148
0:14:32,6 --> 0:14:39,2
Governments never stop printing more currency and adding currency to circulation.


149
0:14:39,2 --> 0:14:46,25
Therefore, prices keep on going up.  Not because they stuff that you're trying to buy is changing.


150
0:14:46,25 --> 0:14:52,3
The real estate doesn't change.  What has changed is the currency purchases less and less.


151
0:14:52,3 --> 0:14:56,31
It's the currency going down.  Not prices going up.


152
0:14:56,31 --> 0:15:1,7
The truth is, what we have that makes our world work right now is a big story.  None of it's real.


153
0:15:1,7 --> 0:15:7,0
It's all just promises.  And if you think about it, that's how currency began to work in the beginning.


154
0:15:7,0 --> 0:15:9,1
You know, before we had currency we had barter.


155
0:15:9,1 --> 0:15:14,52
I'll give you three coconuts and you give me four fish 'cause that's kind of a fair exchange on coconuts and fish.


156
0:15:14,52 --> 0:15:20,6
But that got complicated so we had to invent this thing called money to be a divisible, portable medium of exchange.


157
0:15:20,6 --> 0:15:27,57
And the challenge is that we've lost that a long time ago.  We lost having things of value be our currency.


158
0:15:27,57 --> 0:15:29,85
And now we have this thing called numbers and accounts.  But trust me.


159
0:15:29,85 --> 0:15:33,5
It is not real.  It's a big made up story.


160
0:15:33,5 --> 0:15:38,91
One of the biggest make believe stories ever is called quantitative easing which sounds complex, -


161
0:15:38,91 --> 0:15:42,8
but it's really just a smoke and mirrors term for currency creation.


162
0:15:42,8 --> 0:15:46,6
QE started with the banking bailouts back in 2009.


163
0:15:46,6 --> 0:15:56,0
This currency was created out of thin air and then given to the banks who paid themselves record bonuses in reward for crashing the world economy.


164
0:15:56,0 --> 0:16:3,21
This is a global phenomenon, but all you have to remember for now is that whether it's QE, bailouts, or stimulus programs, -


165
0:16:3,21 --> 0:16:10,21
these are all just voodoo, hocus pocus terms for increased currency creation.


166
0:16:10,21 --> 0:16:16,97
I believe gold and silver will reassert themselves as money and when they do, there just isn't enough.


167
0:16:16,97 --> 0:16:25,3
And their purchasing power is going to go up many, many, many times.


168
0:16:25,3 --> 0:16:33,2
Egypt is an amazing place.  There's a franticness about it, an utter chaos.  Especially like the traffic.


169
0:16:33,2 --> 0:16:38,16
When it comes to like all of the merchants that are trying to get every last dime out of you, -


170
0:16:38,16 --> 0:16:48,0
you get fleeced to the point where you come back with an empty wallet.  [LAUGH]


171
0:16:48,0 --> 0:16:56,7
But you know what?  They're amateurs compared to Wall Street.


172
0:16:56,7 --> 0:17:1,6
In the past several years, I've, I've spoken in many countries about the crisis that's coming, -


173
0:17:1,6 --> 0:17:5,38
and a lot of people think that they're gonna be okay in their country.


174
0:17:5,38 --> 0:17:9,55
That it's only gonna happen in the United States or maybe the United States and Europe.


175
0:17:9,55 --> 0:17:13,8
Uh, but what they don't realize is that this is a global phenomenon.


176
0:17:13,8 --> 0:17:20,66
I got to show you something here.  This is, uh, base currency in the United States.


177
0:17:20,66 --> 0:17:24,21
This is the number of paper dollars that exist basically.


178
0:17:24,21 --> 0:17:29,9
It took 200 years to go from no dollars in existence to 825 billion.


179
0:17:29,9 --> 0:17:36,6
And then we had the bailouts, and then we had QE1, Quantitative Easing 1.


180
0:17:36,6 --> 0:17:46,7
Then QE2.  And then we had QE3 and then QE4 and then soon we're gonna have QE57 and QE382.  [LAUGH]


181
0:17:46,7 --> 0:17:54,1
And, uh, it isn't just here.  This is what the Canadian currency supply looks like.


182
0:17:54,1 --> 0:18:0,6
This is Australia.  South Africa.  Russia.


183
0:18:0,6 --> 0:18:10,77
Now this starts out in just the year 2001, and this is like 18 times more currency in existence in a little over a decade.


184
0:18:10,77 --> 0:18:18,38
Uh, here's Singapore.  Same story.  Look at that.  Since the crisis, just bam.


185
0:18:18,38 --> 0:18:23,6
India.  China.  Every government on the planet is -


186
0:18:23,6 --> 0:18:30,7
doing this insane deficit spending and expanding their currency supplies, uh, doing bailouts.


187
0:18:30,7 --> 0:18:35,51
And history shows that there is no example of this turning out well.


188
0:18:35,51 --> 0:18:42,6
It is sometimes amazing that we haven't experienced more inflation than we have.


189
0:18:42,6 --> 0:18:49,61
If they keep expanding the money supply so vastly, why aren't our prices growing faster than they really are?


190
0:18:49,61 --> 0:18:55,8
And the answer is that a good chunk of the money that the Fed created has been shipped overseas.


191
0:18:55,8 --> 0:19:1,5
Uh, I remember early in my research I heard this expression that the Americans have exported their inflation.


192
0:19:1,5 --> 0:19:6,43
I thought what is that?  How can you export your inflation?  Put it in a box and send it out?  What do you do?


193
0:19:6,43 --> 0:19:13,48
Well now I understand.  You export your inflation by simply sending all these dollars that you created to these other countries -


194
0:19:13,48 --> 0:19:17,82
and then they send you their refrigerators and their cars and whatever, their TV sets.


195
0:19:17,82 --> 0:19:26,39
So you get hardware and they get little pieces of paper.  It's a great deal for the American people for a while.  For a while.


196
0:19:26,39 --> 0:19:30,4
Sooner or later all of those pigeons come home to roost.


197
0:19:30,4 --> 0:19:37,4
When the time comes as it looks like it's now coming, when the rest of the world is saying nuh-uh we don't want to play this game anymore.


198
0:19:37,4 --> 0:19:41,69
Uncle Sam's dollars are just becoming worthless.  There are too many of them.


199
0:19:41,69 --> 0:19:48,0
We've got to find something else other than American dollars.  Then those dollars start to come back to America.


200
0:19:48,0 --> 0:19:50,74
People, we don't want them anymore.  What do we do with them?


201
0:19:50,74 --> 0:19:57,74
Once this revs up and we've got this, this little trickle of money coming back that we'd previously exported, -


202
0:19:57,74 --> 0:20:7,5
when, once it becomes a flood and it starts to rush back, now we are getting our former exported inflation brought back to us.


203
0:20:7,5 --> 0:20:12,72
And then we'll see the quantity of money inside the United States grow much more rapidly -


204
0:20:12,72 --> 0:20:17,3
even than the Federal Reserve can create it because we're getting our previous money back.


205
0:20:17,3 --> 0:20:24,2
And, uh, that's when we will really see the tanking of the U.S. Dollar in terms of what it will buy.


206
0:20:24,2 --> 0:20:29,5
During the second round of quantitative easing, global food prices went up 60 percent, -


207
0:20:29,5 --> 0:20:37,4
and this created a humanitarian disaster for the two billion people on earth who live on less than two dollars a day.


208
0:20:37,4 --> 0:20:46,0
These people were hungry to start with.  They became hungrier and some of them started overthrowing their governments in North Africa and around the Middle East.


209
0:20:46,0 --> 0:20:50,8
So quantitative easing was the spark that ignited the Arab Spring.


210
0:20:50,8 --> 0:20:54,55
So that's, that's it.  When you create money, you get some sort of inflation.


211
0:20:54,55 --> 0:21:7,4
It just depends on where the inflation goes.


212
0:21:7,4 --> 0:21:15,2
Given the premise that you have a permanent underclass or poor class and how does inflation affect them disproportionately,


213
0:21:15,2 --> 0:21:23,2
um, it affects them basically in the percentage of their income that goes to food.


214
0:21:23,2 --> 0:21:27,1
And we see this as a ratio, and we know that there are some danger points.


215
0:21:27,1 --> 0:21:34,0
For example in Egypt recently, once that ratio got to 40 percent of income going to food -


216
0:21:34,0 --> 0:21:42,0
and the price of food rising due to inflation, when it got to 40 percent that's, uh, historically a point where people actually stage a revolution.


217
0:21:42,0 --> 0:21:59,2
That's exactly what we saw.  The French Revolution similarly was all around the price of food getting to a certain critical point where people simply, the risk-reward for revolution was favorable toward revolution.


218
0:21:59,2 --> 0:22:7,4
Well, exactly right because when you have a runaway inflation, it's punishing the very people who are most productive in society.


219
0:22:7,4 --> 0:22:12,8
In other words the people that produce more than they consume and save the difference.


220
0:22:12,8 --> 0:22:18,7
The problem is is that those productive people, the savers, save in their national currency -


221
0:22:18,7 --> 0:22:24,4
and unfortunately the national currency is just a fiat piece of paper at this point.


222
0:22:24,4 --> 0:22:32,4
So when it's destroyed through runaway inflation, that 100,000 dollars that you were hoping to retire on doesn't exist.


223
0:22:32,4 --> 0:22:40,8
And the things that you were gonna buy with it and provide for others don't exist either.  Now what are you gonna do?


224
0:22:40,8 --> 0:22:49,2
So that all seems pretty scary.  However, uh, you know, this is going to happen and you can only play the hand that you're dealt.


225
0:22:49,2 --> 0:22:55,5
But the great news is that gold and silver always end up doing an accounting of the expansion of the currency supplies.


226
0:22:55,5 --> 0:22:59,0
Basically the will of the public and the free markets.


227
0:22:59,0 --> 0:23:5,9
When governments do this kind of stuff to their currency supply, they debase it, eventually it comes back in inflation.


228
0:23:5,9 --> 0:23:11,8
People sense the loss of their puchasing power.  They rush back to gold and silver and they bid the value of -


229
0:23:11,8 --> 0:23:18,6
the gold and silver up in the country until it meets or exceeds the value of all the currency in circulation.


230
0:23:18,6 --> 0:23:26,6
This is a process that's been going on over and over again throughout history except this time it's happening on a global scale.


231
0:23:26,6 --> 0:23:30,65
It has never before happened in all countries at once.


232
0:23:30,65 --> 0:23:34,5
And that means that this is the greatest wealth transfer in history.


233
0:23:34,5 --> 0:23:43,4
Therefore it's the greatest opportunity in history and it's not gonna happen again in your lifetime.


234
0:23:43,4 --> 0:23:47,3
So now we've learned that your true wealth is your time and your freedom.


235
0:23:47,3 --> 0:23:56,3
Money is a trading tool that stores the economic energy that is your time and freedom whereas currencies leak them away.


236
0:23:56,3 --> 0:24:0,1
Gold and silver are the ultimate money simply because of their properties.


237
0:24:0,1 --> 0:24:6,11
Fiat currencies are based solely on confidence and always return to their intrinsic value of zero.


238
0:24:6,11 --> 0:24:13,3
Governments don't like gold because it imposes restraint.  Rising prices are a symptom of an expanding currency supply -


239
0:24:13,3 --> 0:24:18,7
and gold and silver always acocunt for an expanding currency supply.


240
0:24:18,7 --> 0:24:25,29
So that's it for this episode.  Join me next time as we begin to investigate how monetary history just repeats and repeats -


241
0:24:25,29 --> 0:24:29,7
and how gold and silver always win the battle between currency and money.


242
0:24:29,7 --> 0:24:34,0
Until then, my challenge to you is to stop calling currency money.  It's a crucial first step towards setting your mind free of all this economic voodoo and changing your context.


243
0:24:34,0 --> 0:24:40,84
It's a crucial first step towards setting your mind free of all this economic voodoo and changing your context.


244
0:24:40,84 --> 0:24:46,1

Good morning.


248
0:25:2,8 --> 0:25:6,7
Wow.


249
0:25:6,7 --> 0:25:8,4
What does fiat mean?


250
0:25:8,4 --> 0:25:22,3
It comes from the Latin for crappy car.


251
0:25:22,3 --> 0:25:27,19
I'm in the desert in a suit.


252
0:25:27,19 --> 0:25:29,3
My camel died.


253
0:25:29,3 --> 0:25:36,4
You're not too sure about that are you?  Huh?


254
0:25:36,4 --> 0:25:40,9
I am ready for a, a good long nap.


255
0:25:40,9 --> 0:25:46,8
Hi, welcome to this bonus feature for the very first episode of hidden secrets of money, -


256
0:25:46,8 --> 0:27:46,8
uh, and this is currency vs money.  So that's the, uh, major topic-
