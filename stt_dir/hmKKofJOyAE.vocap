###1 FEMALE SPEAKER: So as many of you, I'm sure, already know,
###5 George Saunders has been charming readers and critics
###9 alike for years with his truly unique brand
###13 of speculative fiction.
###15 He's the recipient of a MacArthur Grant, as well as a
###18 professor of creative writing at Syracuse University.
###22 And lucky us-- he's here to promote his--
###25 what was, for me at least-- a long
###27 awaited new book of stories.
###30 By the way, "Tenth of December" is available in the
###32 back via Books Inc. Thank you so much, you guys.
###36 And please help me welcome George Saunders.
###39 [APPLAUSE]
###44 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Thank you.
###45 Thanks everybody for being here-- nice to see you all.
###48 I thought I would just read a little sample
###50 from the new book.
###51 And then we could just talk informally about writing, or
###54 maybe the creative process, or whatever comes up.
###58 So this first thing, I'll just read a little--
###61 I was on a reading tour a couple years ago and I drew
###64 this Polish driver who was done.
###67 He'd driven enough.
###68 And he was like a zen driver.
###69 He could drive without getting you anywhere.
###71 [LAUGHTER]
###72 And he was taking me to this bookstore reading, and he
###75 said, "Sir, you go now to do reading?" I said, "Yeah." He
###78 said, "Little advice for you.
###80 Don't read too long." And I thought, oh you know my work.
###85 But basically, you never leave a literary reading going,
###87 damn, I wish he'd read another 40 minutes.
###89 So I'll just give you a little sample.
###91 And I never was a big sci-fi reader as a kid.
###96 Except the one real big moment of my reading, or my cultural
###101 life, was that moment in Star Wars when the ships come over
###104 and you can see that they're dented and
###105 rusty and fucked up.
###107 And I thought that was really a major revelation.
###110 So some of my stuff is kind of sci-fi.
###112 This is definitely kind of sci-fi.
###114 And I think it's self explanatory.
###116 But basically, this guy is in a--
###120 well, you don't where he is at first-- but he's being
###123 ritually administered these different kinds of drugs.
###126 And these drugs, as they do, they change everything.
###130 So he's, you'll see in the course of the story, there's
###132 some inflections in his voice and consciousness that are
###136 from these drugs that are being dripped in.
###137 And later you find out that actually he's in prison.
###140 And his mom has scratched some money together to get him into
###143 this slightly nicer prison, where instead of being a
###146 prisoner, you're--
###148 what did we used to call it in the corporate world-- like a
###151 research assistant.
###152 [LAUGHTER]
###153 So this is a little section from "Escape from
###155 Spiderhead." "One.
###161 Drip on?" Abnesti said over the P.A.
###165 "What's in it?," I said.
###167 "Hilarious," he said.
###169 "Acknowledge," I said.
###171 Abnesti used his remote.
###173 My MobiPak trademark word.
###177 Soon the interior garden looked really nice.
###180 Everything seemed super clear.
###183 I said out loud, as I was supposed
###185 to, what I was feeling.
###188 "Garden looks nice," I said. "Super clear."
###191 Abnesti said, "Jeff, how about we pep up those language
###194 centers?" "Sure," I said.
###198 "Drip on?" he said.
###201 "Acknowledge," I said.
###204 He added some Verbaluce to the drip, and soon I was feeling
###208 the same things but saying them better.
###211 The garden still looked nice.
###212 It was like the bushes were so tight seeming and the sun made
###216 everything stand out.
###218 It was like any moment you expected some Victorians to
###223 wander in with their cups of tea.
###226 It was as if the garden had become a sort of embodiment of
###228 the domestic dreams forever intrinsic to human
###230 consciousness.
###232 It was as if I could suddenly discern, in this contemporary
###235 vignette, the ancient corollary, through which Plato
###238 and some of his contemporaries might have strolled; to wit I
###240 was sensing the eternal and the ephemeral.
###244 I sat pleasantly engaged in these thoughts until the
###246 Verbaluce began to wane.
###248 At which point, the garden just looked nice again.
###253 It was something about the bushes and whatnot.
###256 It made you just want to lay out there and catch rays and
###258 think your happy thoughts, if you get what I mean.
###261 Then whatever else was in the drip wore off, and I didn't
###263 feel much about the garden one way or the other.
###267 My mouth was dry though and my gut had that post Verbaluce
###270 feel to it.
###271 "What's going to be cool about that one?" Abnesti said, "Is,
###274 say a guy has to stay up late guarding a perimeter or is at
###277 school waiting for his kid and gets bored, but there's some
###280 nature nearby.
###282 Or say a park ranger has to work a double shift."
###286 "That'll be cool," I said.
###288 "That's ED763," he said. "We're thinking of calling it
###291 NatuGlide or maybe ErthAdmire." "Those are both
###296 good," I said.
###298 "Thanks for your help, Jeff," he said, which is what he
###301 always said.
###303 "Only a million years to go," I said, which is
###305 what I always said.
###308 Then he said, "Exit the interior garden now, Jeff.
###310 Head over to small workroom two." Into small workroom two
###315 they sent this pale, tall girl.
###318 "What do you think?" Abnesti said over the P.A. "Me?" I
###323 said, "Or her?" "Both," Abnesti said.
###328 "Pretty good," I said.
###330 "Fine, you know," she said, "normal." Abnesti then asked
###334 us to rate each other more quantifiably as per
###336 pretty, as per sexy.
###339 It appeared we liked each other about average, i.e. no
###343 big attraction or revulsion either way.
###346 Abnesti said, "Jeff, drip on?" "Acknowledge," I said.
###350 "Heather, drip on?" he said.
###353 "Acknowledge," Heather said.
###356 Then we looked at each other like, what happens next?
###360 What happened next was Heather soon looked super good.
###365 And I could tell she thought the same of me.
###368 It came on so sudden.
###369 We were like laughing.
###370 How could we not have seen it--
###372 how cute the other one was?
###374 Luckily, there was a couch in the workroom.
###376 It felt like our drip had, in addition to whatever they were
###379 testing, some ED556 in it, which lowers your shame level
###383 to like nil.
###385 Because soon, there on the couch, off we went.
###388 It was super hot between us, and not merely
###390 in a horndog way.
###392 Hot yes, but also just right--
###394 like if you dreamed of a certain girl all your life and
###396 all of a sudden there she was in your same workroom.
###400 "Jeff," Abnesti said, "I'd like your permission to pep up
###403 your language centers?" "Go for it," I
###405 said, under her now.
###409 "Drip on," he said.
###410 "Acknowledge," I said.
###413 "Me too," Heather said.
###414 "You got it," Abnesti said with a laugh.
###416 "Drip on?" "Acknowledge," she said all breathless.
###419 Soon, experiencing the benefits of the flowing
###421 Verbaluce in our drips, we were not only fucking really
###424 well, but also talking pretty great.
###427 Like instead of just saying the sex types of things we had
###429 been saying, such as wow, and oh God, and hell yes, and so
###432 forth, we now began free styling re our sensations and
###436 thoughts in elevated diction with 80% increased vocab, our
###441 well articulated thoughts being
###442 recorded for later analysis.
###445 For me the feeling was approximately astonishment at
###447 the dawning realization that this woman was being created
###449 in real time, directly from my own mind,
###452 per my deepest longings.
###454 Finally, after all these years, was my thought, I'd
###456 found the precise arrangement of body, face, mind that
###458 personified all that was desirable.
###461 The taste of her mouth, that look of that halo of blondish
###464 hair spread out around her cherubic, yet
###466 naughty looking face.
###467 She was beneath me now, legs way up.
###470 Even, not to be crude or dishonor the exalted feelings
###472 I was experiencing, the sensations her vagina was
###475 producing along the length of my thrusting penis were
###477 precisely those I had always hungered for.
###481 Though I had never before this instant realized that I so
###483 ardently hungered for them.
###485 That is to say a desire would arise, and concurrently, the
###488 satisfaction of that desire would also arise.
###492 It was as if A, I longed for a certain heretofore untasted
###495 taste, until B, said longing became nearly unbearable, at
###499 which time C, I found a morsel of food with that exact taste
###502 already in my mouth, perfectly satisfying my longing.
###506 Every utterance, every adjustment of posture, bespoke
###509 the same thing.
###509 We had known each other forever, were soulmates, had
###512 met and loved in numerous preceding lifetimes and would
###515 meet and love in many subsequent lifetimes, always
###518 with the same transcendentally stupefying results.
###521 Then there came a hard to describe, but very real,
###523 drifting off into a number of sequential reveries that might
###527 best be described as a type of nonnarrative
###529 mind scenery, i.e.
###531 A series of vague mental images of places I had never
###534 been, a certain pine packed valley in high white
###537 mountains, a chalet type house in a cul-de-sac, the yard of
###540 which was overgrown with wide, stunted, Seussian trees, each
###544 of which triggered a deep sentimental longing--
###547 longings that coalesced into and were soon reduced to one
###550 central longing, i.e.
###551 An intense longing for Heather, and Heather alone.
###555 This mind scenery phenomenon was strongest during our third
###558 bout of lovemaking.
###560 Apparently Abnesti had included some
###562 Vivistif in my drip.
###564 Afterward our protestations of love poured forth
###567 simultaneously, linguistically complex and
###570 metaphorically rich.
###571 I dare say we had become poets.
###574 We were allowed to lie there, limbs intermingled
###576 for nearly an hour.
###577 It was bliss, it was perfection, it was that
###581 impossible thing--
###582 happiness that does not wilt to reveal the thin shoots of
###585 some new desire rising from within it.
###588 We cuddled with a fierceness/focus that rivaled
###590 the fierceness/focus with which we had fucked.
###593 There is nothing less about cuddling vis-a-vis fucking, is
###597 what I mean to say.
###598 We were all over each other in the super friendly way of
###601 puppies or spouses meeting for the first time after one of
###605 them has undergone a close brush with death.
###607 Everything seemed moist, permeable, sayable.
###613 Then something in the drip began to wane.
###616 I think Abnesti had shut off the Verbaluce,
###619 also the shame reducer.
###621 Basically, everything began to dwindle.
###624 Suddenly we felt shy, but still loving.
###629 We began the process of trying to talk apres Verbaluce--
###632 always awkward.
###633 Yet, I could see in her eyes that she was still feeling
###636 love for me, and I was definitely still
###638 feeling love for her.
###640 Well, why not?
###641 We had just fucked three times.
###644 Why do you think they call it making love?
###647 That is what we had just made three times--
###649 love.
###650 Then Abnesti said, "Drip on?"
###654 We had kind of forgotten he was even there behind his one
###656 way mirror.
###658 I said, "Do we have to?
###659 We are really liking this right now." "We're just going
###662 to try to get you guys back to baseline," he said. "We've got
###665 more to do today."
###667 "Shit," I said.
###668 "Rats," she said.
###670 "Drip on?" Abnesti said.
###673 "Acknowledge," we said.
###676 Soon something began to change.
###678 I mean, she was fine, a handsome, pale girl, but
###685 nothing special.
###687 And I could see that she felt the same about me, i.e what
###690 had all that fuss been about just now?
###693 Why weren't we dressed?
###695 We real quick got dressed--
###698 kind of embarrassing.
###700 Did I love her, or did she love me?
###702 Ha, no.
###705 Then it was time for her to go.
###707 We shook hands.
###709 Out she went.
###711 Lunch came in on a tray--
###713 spaghetti with chicken chunks.
###716 Man was I hungry.
###718 I spent all of lunch time thinking.
###719 It was weird.
###720 I had the memory of fucking Heather, the memory of having
###722 felt the things I'd felt for her, the memory of having said
###725 the things I'd said to her.
###727 My throat was like raw from how much I'd said and how fast
###730 I felt compelled to say it.
###732 But in terms of feelings, I basically had nada left--
###736 just a hot face and some shame re having fucked three times
###739 in front of Abnesti.
###742 So I'll stop there and deliver what "Reading Rainbow" calls a
###744 cliffhanger, and thank you.
###748 [INAUDIBLE]
###749 [APPLAUSE]
###755 So now, if anybody has a question I'm happy to take it.
###759 And there's a funny phenomenon.
###761 I've been doing a lot of readings.
###762 And there's this weird thing where invariably the person
###766 who asks the first question is the one with the highest
###768 sexual energy in the gathering.
###770 [LAUGHTER]
###771 It's weird.
###772 It's like some kind of Darwinian thing.
###774 [LAUGHTER]
###778 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
###780 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah, I had an idea it was you.
###783 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
###785 
###787 AUDIENCE: I had the opportunity the other day to
###788 read a little "New York Times Magazine" article about you.
###791 And in the back, at the bottom of it, they mentioned that you
###795 studied or practiced some [? Yingla ?]
###797 Buddhism.
###797 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah.
###798 AUDIENCE: And a lot of this stuff, in terms of perception
###801 and having alternate viewpoints, different ways of
###804 understanding our experience and reality, particularly
###806 generating experience and being able to appreciate that
###810 and work with that came out.
###812 And I wanted to, I guess hear a couple points about how you
###816 deal with the flexibility of understanding how we perceive
###821 things and how we generate [INAUDIBLE].
###822 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Sure, that's a great question.
###823 I think, for me, that the answer is a little simple,
###827 which is, for me, everything that I do in fiction is
###831 through the language, like the individual sentence.
###833 And it's a funny thing, because when you're a young
###835 writer, you're concept heavy.
###837 And you usually participate in some version of the
###840 intentional fallacy, which is your job as a writer is to
###844 pull up the big shit truck full of meaning or theme and
###849 get the reader [INAUDIBLE]
###850 sit there and, bam, and drop that.
###853 And it's a fundamentally condescending view.
###856 Which I think most of us when we're young artists, we have
###859 that idea, that you're a good artist to the extent that
###862 you're conveying some theme.
###864 So I had a long period of not doing much in art, because I
###868 was operating under that assumption.
###870 And I had a breakthrough where I realized that in order to be
###873 in the kind of intimate relationship you have to be in
###876 with your reader, you have to commit to not being sure about
###880 what's happening.
###880 In other words, to come into it with as low content as
###883 possible and feel your way through it by watching the
###887 energy coming off the prose.
###889 So that's the main answer for me, is as I'm writing I'm
###894 imagining an intelligent, engaged person right over
###897 here, who's smart and is a little skeptical and is
###902 watching me to see if I'm going to pull any tricks.
###906 And I imagine a little gauge in my head-- like positive
###908 over here and negative here.
###910 So as you're reading your own prose, you're watching that
###912 needle, and you're trying to keep it up in the positive.
###915 And when it gets negative, then your job is to be all
###918 right with that.
###920 And like a scientist, to say well, why did it
###922 do that do you think?
###924 Why is it on page two, nine lines in, I just felt a little
###928 bit of a drop.
###929 And then, if you can avoid answering that too
###932 reductively, then it opens up.
###935 So really, in a way, that's the answer to your question.
###938 But I also was raised Catholic.
###940 And we did this intense thing called the stations of the
###943 cross, which maybe some of you did.
###945 And this was the '60s, so we really did it.
###948 We did it for five straight days, naked in the desert
###951 being flayed.
###953 But the thing was, there were these images of the suffering
###955 of Christ around the room.
###957 And so you sat and you looked at each one.
###959 So now it was the second station.
###960 And there was a little narration from the Bible.
###963 And then you were to sit, quietly, and think about it.
###967 And we had one nun who was wonderful, because she would
###969 say, think about what was Jesus experiencing and so on.
###973 And then she'd say, think about what the Roman soldier
###975 was thinking.
###976 What about that guy-- there's an image-- what about that guy
###978 standing to the side?
###979 What's his role?
###980 So that was early, like Novel Writing 101.
###984 But from an early time, the idea was a part of the fictive
###986 process was generating empathy for somebody
###989 that you might not.
###991 I'm not sure if I'm answering your question at all.
###993 [LAUGHTER]
###994 GEORGE SAUNDERS: And when I was a child--
###997 Thank you for your question.
###998 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
###999 It's really just about how to appreciate the different ways
###1002 of perceiving--
###1003 like you were saying, like you can have [INAUDIBLE] the
###1005 different characters or understanding that we create
###1007 our reality to a certain extent.
###1008 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Exactly.
###1009 And for me, one of the interesting fictive points is
###1011 that if you were trying to make a quote, unquote accurate
###1013 picture of this room, it would probably consist of 107
###1018 separate mind streams going at once and occasionally
###1021 interacting.
###1023 And often the explosiveness of the interaction has to do with
###1026 the mind streams.
###1028 He's thinking, no one respects me.
###1029 I never get a break.
###1030 And then she's thinking about her sick mother and she
###1033 inadvertently steps on his foot.
###1035 And a shit storm happens.
###1037 But actually it's not really a physical, it's two mind
###1040 streams bumping a little bit.
###1044 Congratulations on your sexual energy also.
###1045 [LAUGHTER]
###1049 AUDIENCE: I wondered if you could say a few things about
###1052 your influences.
###1053 And the reason that I'm interested in this is
###1057 listening to you in this piece resurrected for me a powerful
###1062 memory of having read "Flowers for Algernon."
###1064 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Oh yeah, sure.
###1065 Sure, yep.
###1067 AUDIENCE: I feel like it's really beautiful
###1070 in a similar way.
###1072 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah, I know.
###1073 I had the same-- when I was writing the
###1074 story, I went oh I remember.
###1075 I didn't really remember the details of the story, but I
###1077 thought, oh I'm channeling that.
###1079 AUDIENCE: Yeah
###1079 GEORGE SAUNDERS: You know I think when I was younger, I
###1081 hated any kind of suggestion that my work had anything to
###1084 do with anything that had ever occurred.
###1086 And then as you get older, you're like well of course,
###1088 where else are you going to come from, except all the
###1091 influences that have passed through you?
###1092 So in a way, that they might be at the heart of that
###1095 Picasso thing about, was it good artists borrow, great
###1098 artists steal?
###1100 That saying, yeah of course, in any kind of work none of us
###1104 exist totally originally.
###1108 And maybe your supplements as an artist is your willingness
###1111 to let those influences flow through you.
###1113 [INAUDIBLE]
###1114 And then the other thing I noticed is when you're on a
###1116 book tour that you always get the influence question.
###1118 And the first thing is to go, well of course, Shakespeare.
###1122 Jesus, Mother Teresa was quite important, right?
###1125 But then when you really think about it, for me, the '70s
###1127 comics were usually--
###1129 Steve Martin in his early incarnation, Monty Python,
###1133 George Carlin.
###1134 And in our school, that was really a way to get a little
###1138 bit of credibility is that you could stand up and recite the
###1140 George Carlin album or do a passable Steve Martin.
###1143 So I had a long period where I really considered that low--
###1147 not literary.
###1148 And because of where I came from, I thought, well
###1152 literature--
###1153 I never had met writers.
###1154 Literature is a thing that you can't quite do, where you
###1157 totally become someone else.
###1159 And only at this crisis point, I went well maybe not.
###1162 Maybe literature is where you really open up the valve to
###1165 everybody that you've been.
###1166 And for me that meant letting in the sound of vestigial
###1169 Steve Martin and the Monty Python.
###1173 So I think influence can sometimes may be more full
###1175 body than we think it is.
###1178 AUDIENCE: Hi.
###1179 I saw you come to Google about five years ago.
###1183 And I wanted to hear you talk a little bit about what it
###1185 must be like five years later to have some of your stories
###1189 coming true and we're making them happen.
###1192 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah.
###1194 AUDIENCE: My neighbors, for example, just got some
###1197 [INAUDIBLE]
###1198 in Atherton.
###1199 And so I was just wondering if you draw, I guess, inspiration
###1204 from Silicon Valley?
###1207 Or if it's, I don't know, some other level of inspiration?
###1213 GEORGE SAUNDERS: I don't really do a lot of research or
###1215 direct tapping for ideas.
###1216 But I think my feeling is that if you were wired right, and
###1221 if you were alert enough, even the most banal moment would be
###1225 crazy and full of wonder.
###1226 So the fact that we're here, we're at Google, we're feeling
###1230 pretty good, most of us are young, and yet
###1234 we know for a fact--
###1235 totally verifiable--
###1236 that in x number of years we'll all be
###1238 rotting corpses somewhere.
###1240 We know it.
###1240 Why are we so happy?
###1241 Why are we eating lunch?
###1242 [LAUGHTER]
###1243 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Or even to be a little more serious, we
###1246 venture forth every day in love with somebody or somebody
###1250 is beloved to us, and yet the incredible vulnerability that
###1255 everyone comes to an end, including the people
###1257 you love, for sure.
###1259 So to me that--
###1261 what's weird is the habitual position of
###1264 being OK with that.
###1265 Yeah, I know it's true, but my phone's a
###1267 little low on battery.
###1268 It's crazy really.
###1270 So to me the inspiration for the weird pieces is just
###1275 through the writing process, through revising, through
###1278 trying not to be dull, to try to get some sense of that
###1282 wonder back into prose.
###1284 So I don't really do a lot of looking for weird things.
###1288 Also, the other thing I notice, I don't really have as
###1292 much judgment about contemporary culture as people
###1295 think I do.
###1295 I like it.
###1296 I like everything.
###1298 I like that--
###1299 
###1301 I won't name companies-- but some of the dangerous
###1303 technological developments, I think it's interesting.
###1307 So to me, the highest position is to have five or six
###1311 opinions, all open, on your desktop.
###1315 And they contradict, and there's no way to reconcile
###1318 them, but you're OK leaving them open.
###1320 That would be the highest aspiration.
###1323 AUDIENCE: Hi.
###1324 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Hi.
###1325 AUDIENCE: When you have a story that plays around with
###1328 characters that are opposites, do you ever find yourself
###1330 having trouble sympathizing with one?
###1332 Or you sympathize more with one over the other?
###1334 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Totally, yeah.
###1336 The question is if there's two different characters, do you
###1338 have trouble with sympathy?
###1339 And I think you absolutely do.
###1341 And you should, really.
###1341 It would be weird if you didn't.
###1343 But then I do this kind of iterative revision thing,
###1347 where I just go into it hundreds and hundreds of
###1349 times, each time tweaking a little something or a lot--
###1352 just expressing my opinion on each draft.
###1355 And what's interesting is if you do that, the first step is
###1359 to out yourself on your bias.
###1361 Like in this book, there's a story called "Puppy."
###1364 And there's these two mothers who are very similar, and they
###1368 had the same interests.
###1370 And in the end, it's catastrophic what happens.
###1372 And in that story, I definitely had a bias for the
###1377 poorer of the two women.
###1378 But when I submitted it to the "New Yorker." she said
###1381 something really smart.
###1382 She said, the way you're writing her dialogue, you're
###1385 condescending to her.
###1387 Because I had written it really straight white trash.
###1390 And she said, that throws the story off.
###1392 You seem like you're making fun of her and
###1393 not the other one.
###1394 So in that, the process was to take her
###1397 dialogue up a little bit.
###1398 And in doing that, she became a more full person.
###1401 And I liked her better.
###1402 So for that story, the critical thing was to do just
###1405 what you're saying-- adjust it, so that there's some
###1406 semblance of equity between the two.
###1409 But I think as a general writing principle, your main
###1411 job is to do something and then notice it.
###1415 And then adjust accordingly.
###1418 And then notice the thing that you've done, and adjust
###1420 accordingly--
###1421 rinse, lather, repeat a million times.
###1423 And then weirdly, in time, the story will adjust itself
###1427 morally to be more fair, which is really a weird thing.
###1430 But yeah, I think you should.
###1431 Of course, you would.
###1434 AUDIENCE: I think it's really interesting what you said
###1435 about acknowledging how your own mindset has changed as a
###1439 writer from a more professorial
###1441 place to more engaging--
###1444 to combine that with what sounds like a very intense
###1447 iterative visionary writing style.
###1449 Do you ever have the desire, or do you ever go back to your
###1451 earlier work thinking I can punch this out.
###1454 GEORGE SAUNDERS: No.
###1455 It's so bad, I don't even try.
###1457 I'll give you an example.
###1458 This is a true story.
###1459 My wife and I we got engaged in three weeks, and we had a
###1465 baby right away.
###1465 And so we were racing.
###1466 And I was working for a company called Rating.
###1468 I was a tech writer, and a very low level tech writer.
###1472 And my wife had been married once before, and had a more
###1476 full, better, a richer life--
###1478 I'll put it that way.
###1479 And I could feel her looking at me like, come on, let's get
###1481 something going.
###1482 So I went on this trip to Mexico.
###1484 And it was this perfect novelist trip.
###1487 It was a wedding, there was a male model slash surfer who
###1491 was in the wedding party, there was a guy who just out
###1493 of jail for a DWI, there was a radical Catholic priest.
###1495 I'm like, this is it!
###1496 It's a gift from God.
###1499 So I came home.
###1500 I'm like, honey, you're sitting on a goldmine.
###1502 Don't worry, I got it.
###1503 So I wrote this novel for about a year and a half, and
###1506 we had one daughter by that time.
###1508 So I get home from work, drink a pot of coffee, and if I was
###1511 feeling really ambitious a bottle of Boone's Farm, which
###1513 is a deadly combo.
###1515 And I would write just until I would drop at the desk, go to
###1518 work, and I did this for a year and a half.
###1520 And then I had the book.
###1521 And it was 700 pages.
###1523 And I thought, no I'm a minimalist.
###1526 So I cut it.
###1527 I cut it to 400, rock hard.
###1530 And so I said, I think I've got a little novel for you to
###1533 read, sweety.
###1534 So she said, OK.
###1535 So I said, just take your time.
###1537 I'll give you a week or so.
###1538 And of course, like any writer, in an hour later I'm
###1540 looking in the room.
###1542 And she's literally sitting at the desk like this, fried.
###1546 So to give you an idea, the name of that book was "Le
###1550 Bourda de Eduardo." Which I think just means Ed's wedding.
###1554 So I don't ever go back to that.
###1556 That stuff has a taint on it.
###1557 I just would rather move ahead.
###1559 Thank you bringing up that painful subject.
###1561 [LAUGHTER]
###1565 But the one thing that I am interested in, and I'm sure
###1567 this is true for you guys too, in any kind of creative work,
###1571 that moment where you--
###1573 Donald Barthelme has a great essay called "I'm not
###1575 Knowing." And he says the writer's that person who
###1580 embarking on her task has no idea what to do.
###1583 And that, to me, seems like the sacred state,
###1586 if you can get there.
###1587 And then Stuart Dybek, this great Chicago writer, has this
###1590 thing about the story Is always talking to you.
###1594 And your job is to listen.
###1595 But for some reason, we have a tendency to not really want to
###1597 hear what the story's natural energy is saying.
###1600 But we want to override it.
###1602 And so I was a geophysical engineer, that was one of the
###1608 big basic scientific principles was you don't go
###1611 into a study rooting for some answer.
###1614 So that was very helpful in writing.
###1617 AUDIENCE: I was wondering if you could speak a bit about
###1619 your editing process.
###1621 Specifically, I read somewhere that "The Semplica Girl
###1623 Diaries" started out as a 200 page story and evolved into a
###1630 10 page story.
###1631 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah.
###1632 AUDIENCE: And I guess without spoiling it for everyone, I'm
###1634 wondering what got left out and how you decided.
###1636 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Sure.
###1637 So the question is about the editing process.
###1639 And I had a story called "The Semplica Girl Diaries" which
###1641 started in '98 and I finish it last spring.
###1644 And it was up to some huge number of pages and got
###1647 drastically cut.
###1649 One of my things is I think as artists we have to submit to
###1653 our neuroses a little bit.
###1655 So often we think that to be an artist, you have to conquer
###1660 your neuroses and be a perfectly
###1662 calm, wonderful person.
###1663 But my experience was rather you turn towards with your
###1667 ticks and go OK, come on.
###1669 So for me I have a real, just like inner nun syndrome, like
###1674 I really don't like what I do.
###1676 When I do it, I feel like, ugh, Mr. Saunders, what do you
###1680 think you are smarty pants?
###1682 So that ends up to be, if you keep it in check, a pretty
###1685 valuable editing tool.
###1689 And I have a slight aversion, I've always had this since I
###1691 was a kid, an aversion to what I consider banal language.
###1694 You know when you're in grade school and they have those
###1696 little readers, and it's like, Jimmy was a bright happy boy
###1698 as he bounced into the room in the middle of a
###1700 bright, fall day.
###1701 It actually made me a little sick.
###1703 There was something so unessential
###1704 about it, and blah.
###1707 So for me, one of the things that I do is I'll get
###1709 something up to a decent length, pretty happily, with
###1712 that feeling that all is well.
###1713 And then that inner nun thing will come in and speed it up.
###1719 And I think the subtext to that is do you respect your
###1722 reader's intelligence?
###1724 So I'll give you an exaggerated example.
###1726 If you have in a first draft something like, Bob came
###1730 happily into the room and sat down on the blue couch.
###1733 Perfectly functional sentence right?
###1736 But it bugs me, because you think, wait, why does he have
###1740 to sit down on a couch?
###1743 Can you sit up on a couch?
###1745 All right, well let's cut the word down.
###1747 Bob came happily into the room and sat on the blue couch.
###1749 
###1752 Why does he have to come into the room?
###1756 Is there any meaning to him coming into the room?
###1759 Not that we know of--
###1760 OK, cut.
###1761 Bob happily--
###1763 I don't care.
###1764 We don't care about Bob's happiness.
###1766 Bob sat on the blue couch.
###1770 Blue?
###1771 [LAUGHTER]
###1772 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Does blue signify?
###1773 Not really--
###1774 OK, Bob sat on the couch.
###1776 
###1780 Bob?
###1780 [LAUGHTER]
###1783 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Cut it.
###1784 So now we don't have much, but what we have doesn't suck.
###1787 We have Bob.
###1789 So in a slightly less radical way, I apply that kind of
###1792 thinking to the story.
###1793 And the logic is, if I'm making those really seem like
###1797 nitpicky decisions, every time I do it, I'm honoring your
###1800 intelligence a little bit.
###1802 That which you could assume, I'm going to assume that
###1805 you're smart enough to assume.
###1807 And in my model of reading, the whole thing is to get you
###1809 stepping closer and closer and closer,
###1812 trusting me more and more.
###1814 And in the process of trusting me more, the fictive reality
###1816 is becoming more three dimensional.
###1819 And you get that magical fictional moment where you and
###1821 the character aren't different, and you can't
###1824 negotiate your way out of the cliff that's approaching.
###1828 And I think that process is done--
###1831 one way it can be done is by this micro editing to assume
###1835 intelligence.
###1836 So on that story, it was 180 pages.
###1838 But at page 30, you were asleep, basically.
###1841 There was no urgency in it.
###1843 So then part of the job is just to say OK, those are just
###1845 pages and now time to trim it back.
###1849 I don't know if that answers your question, but yeah.
###1853 AUDIENCE: Hi.
###1853 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Hi.
###1853 AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming back.
###1855 You just explained how you spent actually quite a lot of
###1857 time writing books.
###1859 Ed's wedding was a year and a half.
###1860 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yep.
###1861 AUDIENCE: Stuff like that.
###1862 How do you motivate yourself to just keep on going through
###1865 all that time?
###1866 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Right.
###1867 You know, honestly it's just ego.
###1871 I mean, I really like writing.
###1872 And I like to be known as a writer.
###1874 And I like the whole schtick.
###1876 But to me the most horrifying moment is when you send
###1880 something out too soon, or that moment where you have
###1884 misidentified something shitty as good, and it's got your
###1887 name on it.
###1889 It's like ugh.
###1890 It's a nightmare.
###1890 So for me, I have from high school, I loved the-- yeah.
###1897 Some people, they want to be songwriters or
###1899 they want to be whatever.
###1900 I really wanted to be a short story writer.
###1902 And it makes me really happy to be in that harness.
###1907 So I'll get something like that "Semplica Girl Stories."
###1910 I had it in pretty good shape in 1999--
###1913 pretty good.
###1915 But on a scale of 10, it was about a seven and a half.
###1919 And I could feel that I could get it up to 8.3 for sure.
###1922 And at that point, I don't really care how long it takes.
###1925 So it's a lot of negative urge--
###1928 ego, grasping, desperation, but also the pleasure.
###1934 I feel like once you've taken a story, any project you're
###1938 in, once you've really stuck with one to the end and seen
###1941 the benefits, for me that's a bit addictive.
###1944 I know what a finished story feels like, and I'm just not
###1948 interested in not getting there.
###1949 So then it's weird, because it becomes a suspension of time,
###1953 where that story took 12 years.
###1956 That's all right.
###1957 It's out.
###1958 It's better than it was.
###1959 
###1962 AUDIENCE: So I'm taking a short story writing class up
###1965 at Stanford, and we read "CivilWarLand" in "Bad
###1968 Decline." And the whole class really loved the whole book.
###1972 And we discuss your short stories all the time.
###1976 So I wanted to ask you as a professor of creative writing,
###1979 what do you think makes a great writer?
###1980 Is it experience?
###1982 Is it focus?
###1984 Is it getting an MFA?
###1985 Is it getting a Ph.D.?
###1987 Or being an engineer and then having that experience?
###1991 What do you think--
###1992 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Right.
###1992 Yeah, so if you can do all of those, you're good.
###1997 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
###1999 GEORGE SAUNDERS: No, that's a great question.
###2000 You know what's funny is that we are in a moment in America
###2003 where the MFA is getting a big head.
###2007 And Gary Shteyngart, he had this great line.
###2009 He said, we have reached the point in American literary
###2010 culture where the number of readers is exactly equal to
###2013 the number of writers.
###2014 [LAUGHTER]
###2015 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah.
###2016 And I teach in a great program.
###2019 But there's two fallacies that need to be debunked.
###2022 One is to be a writer, you have to get an MFA.
###2026 False.
###2027 Two is if you get an MFA, you'll be a published writer.
###2030 False.
###2032 We've seen a doubling at Syracuse.
###2034 When I go home I have 560 applications to
###2037 read for six spots.
###2038 And the vast majority are from people who are just coming
###2042 from undergrad.
###2043 So there's something weird about that.
###2045 It's not quite right.
###2048 But when they come, our students are off the charts.
###2051 But the thing we teach them-- we try to teach them-- is that
###2055 the answer to your question is nobody knows.
###2058 Nobody knows.
###2059 You can be the smartest person in the room, the most
###2062 articulate, the most well traveled, the most soulful,
###2066 and you can put pen to paper and you don't have any oomph.
###2070 Or you can be a little nondescript person with no
###2072 opinions who just has never really done anything, and
###2076 somehow when you put the pen to paper, this--
###2079 So that's the hard thing.
###2082 But it isn't true of anything worth doing?
###2086 There's an x factor that's magical.
###2088 So what you can do is you can do the work.
###2091 I think that's really important.
###2092 And I found out yesterday that I've been telling a vicious
###2095 lie about Robert Frost for about 10 years.
###2098 I had a student who told me, I thought--
###2100 I maybe misheard him--
###2102 that Frost was doing a seminar at a grad school.
###2105 And a student asked a really involved technical question
###2108 about the sonnet.
###2109 And Frost, to debunk his over conceptual mind said, son,
###2114 don't worry, work.
###2117 And I've been saying for years, that's great advice,
###2118 because Malcolm Gladwell's 10,000 hour rule, and blah,
###2121 blah, blah.
###2121 Well, I just found out that he didn't say that.
###2123 He said, "Don't work.
###2124 Worry."
###2125 [LAUGHTER]
###2126 GEORGE SAUNDERS: So I don't know what
###2127 the hell he was thinking.
###2130 But I think what you'll find is it's something that some of
###2133 us want so desperately--
###2135 to be good writers, I think partly because it feels like
###2137 consciousness.
###2139 When you read a great writer, you feel like you've been
###2142 really seen.
###2144 And you would love to be the person
###2146 who's giving that feeling.
###2147 But because it's so hard, I think it's got to be mystery.
###2151 I do think that for an individual writer, if you put
###2154 the 10,000 hours in, you'll both find out what your issues
###2157 are, and you'll find really weird, unique solutions that
###2161 you never could have imagined at the outset.
###2163 But that process has almost nothing to do with whether
###2166 you'll ultimately be published.
###2168 So it's tricky.
###2171 And you won't make any money.
###2173 [LAUGHTER]
###2175 AUDIENCE: So consuming art is very personal process, so it's
###2179 really hard to say that someone was wrong
###2181 when they did it.
###2181 But in all your work, have you ever witnessed someone
###2184 observing something you wrote and just interpreting it very
###2187 surprisingly, or wrong?
###2189 And how did that make you feel?
###2190 How did that go?
###2191 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah.
###2192 When you said that, it brought back one thing to mind.
###2194 I had written a story called "Winky" which is
###2196 in the second book.
###2196 And it's this story about this guy who goes to a self help
###2199 seminar, and it is the motto of this thing is, "Don't let
###2203 anybody crap in your oatmeal."
###2205 And at home he's got this dim, very religious sister who has
###2209 been kicked out of her house, and she's living with him.
###2211 And he wants to get rid of her.
###2213 So he's thinking, I'm not going to let her crap in my
###2215 oatmeal, even though she's nice and innocent and sweet
###2218 and has nowhere else to go, I've got to live into my own
###2220 personal power.
###2221 So it's obviously a tongue in cheek thing.
###2223 And in the story, he goes home, he's
###2226 resolved to kick her out.
###2227 And when he sees her, he can't.
###2229 And he melts.
###2230 But the kicker is that he feels terrible that he's not a
###2233 powerful enough person.
###2234 So that's the story.
###2235 So it came out in the "New Yorker." And about a week
###2237 later, I get this letter.
###2238 And this guy says, my name is so and so.
###2241 I work with Charlton Heston at the NRA, so I suspect
###2244 politically we have our differences.
###2246 
###2248 But I loved your story.
###2251 It helped me so much.
###2253 This is a great example of art crossing
###2255 the left/right divide.
###2256 And of course, I was like, ye check off!
###2258 See, I did it.
###2261 And so of course, fishing for further compliments, I said,
###2263 oh thank you so much brother.
###2266 Tell me a little more about how I changed your life.
###2270 And he said, well my mother is in very good health.
###2273 She's 72, and she had a very mild stroke, which has caused
###2277 me some inconvenience.
###2278 And your story convinced me to put her in a rest home.
###2281 [LAUGHTER]
###2284 And I was like, what?
###2287 And I wrote him back this long thing.
###2288 No sir, please, you've misunderstood.
###2290 And I gave him the whole exogesis of the thing.
###2292 And he's like, that's cool, have a good day.
###2295 That was that.
###2296 So yeah, I think once you put something out there, there is
###2299 no freaking telling what someone's going
###2301 to read into it.
###2303 But what I've noticed is,
###2304 statistically, most people don't.
###2306 And that guy was looking.
###2307 I mean, he could have gotten that excuse from a Starbucks
###2310 cup, reading the coffee grounds or something.
###2312 But I think you have to assume that-- and it's interesting to
###2315 do a tour, and this book is actually selling, so I'm
###2318 meeting a lot of people.
###2318 And it's amazing how many good hearted, good readers there
###2322 are who do get more--
###2324 get what you put in it and then even more.
###2326 So mostly not-- that was the one example I can
###2328 really think of.
###2330 AUDIENCE: Also because of that story, I say crapping in my
###2333 oatmeal, and no one knows what I'm talking about.
###2335 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah.
###2336 See?
###2336 So there was a good outcome too, so it's a balance.
###2339 Thank you.
###2339 Thanks for the question.
###2341 AUDIENCE: So I just wanted to address something.
###2343 One of the reasons why your stories grab me is that they
###2347 seem so honest.
###2349 And I think I read a reviewer that said something about how
###2354 you can come closer to truth in fiction sometimes
###2356 than in real life.
###2357 So I wanted to ask you, how do you as you're writing try and
###2361 sidle up to truth through fiction?
###2363 GEORGE SAUNDERS: That's a great question.
###2364 And I think the answer is a phrase at a time.
###2367 Because if I think about what do I think is true, or if you
###2370 think, what's true?
###2372 We have some answers.
###2374 But mine are a little rickety.
###2375 They're a little conceptual, they're a little political.
###2378 So what I love about fiction is if you start with anything
###2381 really, any prejudice or whatever, through this
###2385 iterative process of trying to get your prose not to be a
###2389 buzz kill, basically, then weirdly you'll gradually move
###2394 towards truth and specificity.
###2396 So if you say, Bob was ugly--
###2399 back to Bob again--
###2401 Bob was ugly.
###2401 Well, if you're a trained reader, that sentence leaves
###2404 you a little, eh.
###2406 You're waiting for detail, right?
###2408 So then if you write that on Tuesday.
###2411 Wednesday you come back and say that's vague, let
###2413 me flesh that out.
###2416 Bob wore an ugly sweater.
###2418 OK, now suddenly we're talking about a guy with bad taste.
###2420 It's changed a little bit--
###2422 still not very specific.
###2424 Bob wore a stained red sweater with the torn blue pocket and
###2428 a reindeer on the abdomen.
###2431 Well, that's a better sense already.
###2433 And suddenly now it's about Bob is now
###2436 a little bit slovenly--
###2439 almost belligerently slovenly.
###2441 And that's interesting, suddenly.
###2443 And then it produces plot too.
###2445 Because having established that Blob--
###2447 Blob?
###2448 [LAUGHTER]
###2450 GEORGE SAUNDERS: I'm editing right now.
###2451 So having established that Blob is belligerently
###2453 slothful, then we know what might have to happen to him.
###2457 So in the bad Hollywood version, he meets an
###2459 incredibly neat girl, played by Angelina Jolie.
###2464 So I think if you take the thing a phrase at a time, that
###2468 boat will mysteriously move towards truth, and also it'll
###2473 move you to a place of empathy.
###2475 When we live in New York, upstate, I used to wait for a
###2479 bus across from this barbershop.
###2482 And there was this middle aged barber who came out--
###2484 a pear shaped guy-- and he'd come out with a
###2485 cigarette and a coffee.
###2486 And every time a woman walked by, he would just go, zoom.
###2491 And even when she busted him, he'd just keep looking.
###2493 And we just had our daughters, so I was like a new feminist.
###2497 And I noticed this guy.
###2499 And I thought, I am going to nail that guy.
###2500 I am going to write a story and just make fun of him.
###2502 So I started, and it was really enjoyable--
###2505 this guy with this thought stream
###2506 that's always perverted.
###2509 And then about a year into that, the story just died.
###2512 I couldn't get it to go past the middle part.
###2514 It was fun.
###2514 It very funny.
###2518 And it finally occurred to me, the reason I couldn't get it
###2520 to move is because I was so intent on kicking him, that I
###2524 wasn't giving him any hope of getting
###2526 out of that low position.
###2527 And that's not a story.
###2529 There has to be at least a trace--
###2532 the hope that the person could transcend himself.
###2534 So as soon as I did that, I thought I've got to make this
###2537 guy more sympathetic.
###2538 Now because I'm not that subtle, I wrote in
###2541 that he had no toes.
###2542 So that was my subtle Chekovian move there.
###2547 But I did it, because suddenly here's a guy who now he's
###2550 still a sexist, and he's very defensive, and he
###2554 doesn't have any toes.
###2556 So suddenly, oh, poor guy, and so then the
###2560 story could move ahead.
###2561 So I think that's where the honesty and everything comes
###2563 from just line by line immersion in
###2566 the thing, I think.
###2567 Yeah, but the funny thing about that, because that story
###2571 come out in the "New Yorker." And by that time, I'd spent
###2573 about three years with this projection of
###2574 this guy in my mind.
###2575 So we happened to be in that town.
###2577 And I'm walking down the street with my wife and my two
###2579 daughters, and lo and behold this guy steps
###2581 out onto the sidewalk.
###2583 And I thought, George, you bastard.
###2586 You just mocked this guy in the "New Yorker." You don't
###2588 know who he is.
###2589 He could be a million [INAUDIBLE]
###2591 the tyranny of fiction.
###2593 But as we walked by, he looked at my wife and my daughters
###2595 and he goes, ladies.
###2597 Like that, and I thought, wow!
###2599 [LAUGTHER]
###2601 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah, score!
###2603 
###2606 AUDIENCE: I'm wondering if you'd talk a little bit about
###2607 how your process is the same and/or different when working
###2611 on nonfiction rather than fiction.
###2612 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Sure.
###2613 Yeah, I did a series of nonfiction pieces for "GQ,"
###2616 mostly travel based pieces.
###2618 And those were such a relief, because in fiction, as I've
###2622 said, I'm doing a lot of rewriting to generate plot, to
###2626 say, well what's the next thing that should happen, that
###2628 could happen, that's meaningful.
###2629 And for some reason, that takes me a lot of hours.
###2632 So with the nonfiction, you come home from a week and you
###2635 know there are 10 things that happened.
###2638 So then the process is just trying to write those 10 and
###2640 see which one of them comes to life.
###2642 And then once, say six of them do, four of them don't, then
###2646 you just do a calculation.
###2647 I've got 12,000 words, I can take this one up,
###2650 turn this one down.
###2650 So it's a little more like engineering work--
###2652 you're cutting to fit.
###2655 And then the meaning of the story, and the theme, come out
###2658 of which elements have risen to the occasion a little bit.
###2661 So that tends to be faster.
###2663 Your main job is to make whatever you do charming on a
###2667 sentence to sentence level.
###2668 But the events are given to you.
###2669 So that's really a nice palate cleanser in a way.
###2673 AUDIENCE: I think I read in an interview with your editor
###2677 saying that with nonfiction you tended to give extra
###2680 material to the editor.
###2681 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah.
###2681 AUDIENCE: How does that process work?
###2683 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Well, basically, at "GQ" I always
###2686 had a week long trip and 12,000 words.
###2688 So you'd get those three or four bits.
###2690 You're like I can't believe that's not going in there.
###2693 And you have a point in time vision of your 12,000 words,
###2698 but this part over here still feels red hot.
###2701 So in that setting, you had the liberty of saying what do
###2705 you think, should I try to fit this in?
###2706 And my editor, Andy Ward, is just a great
###2708 friend and a great guy.
###2709 And he can just say, no, no, no, yes, put that one in.
###2713 And once he's said that, then it becomes really like a
###2715 Rubik's cube.
###2715 Where does it go, what do I have to give up to get that
###2718 back, and so on?
###2719 But just to have a second set of eyes saying, actually no,
###2722 you've got that, that one's not so good, I think there's
###2725 heat in that third one, put it in.
###2729 AUDIENCE: My question is about how your world view influences
###2732 your writing.
###2734 In many of your interviews, you've talked about when you
###2737 started off and you were working as an engineer, you
###2740 had the sense that things could go drastically wrong in
###2743 your life at any point, how it was very fragile.
###2748 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Right.
###2749 AUDIENCE: And that world view seems to be reflected in
###2752 stories like "CivilWarLand." And now you're famous, you're
###2757 well-to-do, and your books have even started selling.
###2761 I'm wondering how your world view has changed, and whether
###2764 that change affects how you write and approach fiction?
###2767 GEORGE SAUNDERS: That's a great question, yeah.
###2768 For me, when we were young, a writer is like the canary in a
###2774 coal mine in that we were never in the gulag.
###2778 We were way over extended on credit
###2780 cards, but not starving.
###2783 But I found that just that little whiff of fear that you
###2787 have when you have small kids and you're
###2789 not a powerful person--
###2791 that was enough to really--
###2793 you know that great Terry Eagleton quote about
###2795 "Capitalism plunders the sensuality of the body." So I
###2799 could feel that.
###2800 And so I got those first two books out of that.
###2803 Now why that was a revelation, I'm not quite sure.
###2805 I should have known that.
###2807 So now it's later, and our kids are wonderful and grown.
###2811 And so the one thing I notice, my desire, what I want to
###2815 accomplish before die is to try to make a fictional scale
###2819 model of the world in which the positive and the negative,
###2823 the hopeful and the not are there in a compelling mix.
###2828 And I noticed it --
###2831 when you look at my earlier work, it's very good at
###2835 showing the potential for chaos.
###2840 And I just want to try to get some of the positive valence
###2842 in there, in a way that's not cheesy, that's not
###2844 sentimental or corny.
###2845 But I think any of us who live in America in this time,
###2848 you've got to love it.
###2850 We're very fortunate.
###2852 Or forget America, you walk through a field of grass on a
###2855 summer day and they just cut it--
###2857 pretty good.
###2858 So for some reason, fiction skews dark.
###2863 Some would say happiness writes white.
###2864 So technically, I think it's harder to get the positive
###2867 valences in.
###2867 And that's my mission, but again, without becoming Mr.
###2872 Positive Thinker--
###2873 the guy who gets a spike through his head and says what
###2875 a great opportunity.
###2878 And I think the great writers do it.
###2879 Tolstoy did it, Shakespeare did it, Virginia Woolf did it,
###2883 Alice Munro does it.
###2884 And so that's my personal mission.
###2888 AUDIENCE: Just a quick follow up question on that.
###2889 I think that you are driving at what was in my mind too.
###2894 Why does fiction tend to be darker?
###2897 GEORGE SAUNDERS: That's a great question.
###2898 AUDIENCE: Why is it so difficult to capture the
###2900 beautiful and positive moments in our lives?
###2903 GEORGE SAUNDERS: I think one answer is just the Little Red
###2906 Riding Hood syndrome, which is if I say once upon a time,
###2909 there was a girl named Little Red Riding Hood.
###2911 Her mother told her, don't talk to the wolf,
###2913 and then she didn't.
###2914 [LAUGTHER]
###2918 GEORGE SAUNDERS: So I think it's just
###2919 something about maybe--
###2920 here, I'm just guessing-- but maybe at some level,
###2923 storytelling is cautionary in its design.
###2927 And I think that even in the Bible, these things don't
###2931 often come out well.
###2933 But in the Bible, they do--
###2935 the Resurrection is the big--
###2937 so I think it's possible.
###2938 But for some reason, certainly at the beginning levels,
###2940 smirking is so easy, to make fun of something is easy.
###2944 And when we get our applications, it's funny.
###2946 Because every year, you're reading young writers.
###2949 And so for example, it turns out that in that fictive
###2953 country, everybody over 35 is a pedophile--
###2958 everybody.
###2959 And every person, for example, any midget is a
###2965 genius, is a sage.
###2967 Those are the only ones who ever show up.
###2970 There's tropes that you get into--
###2972 every stepfather is a terrible monster, who only reveals
###2976 himself on page 12.
###2977 So that's not true.
###2979 It's just a pattern of imagination.
###2981 So I don't really know why that is.
###2983 But I know for sure, from experience, it's harder to get
###2985 into those high registers.
###2987 AUDIENCE: Hello.
###2989 I want to ask you about Hemingway's influence on you.
###2994 I was listening yesterday at the forum.
###2996 You spoke about how you tried to imitate him or
###2999 work a lot like him.
###3000 And it was frustrating at the end.
###3003 And earlier, you spoke about how you make
###3007 something sound true.
###3009 And I think Hemingway, in one of his books when he was in
###3013 Paris, I think he tells that he tries to write something
###3016 that sounds the truest.
###3018 That's a technique, I think, for him.
###3021 If it sounds true, then it's good enough.
###3023 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Right.
###3024 AUDIENCE: And so my question is, are there things that you
###3027 learn from Hemingway that you use in your writings, like
###3031 this one or other things that you can talk about?
###3034 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah, Hemingway was a huge
###3036 influence, as he is, I think, on a lot of writers.
###3039 And at some point, you get to that critical point where your
###3042 worldview and your hero's diction just don't close.
###3047 So I was living in Amarillo, Texas and trying to be
###3050 Hemingway too.
###3051 And so you'd go like, Nick walked into the Walmart .
###3055 It was pleasant.
###3056 [LAUGHTER]
###3057 GEORGE SAUNDERS: But there's, for a young writer, that
###3059 wonderful moment where you go I know things in my gut that I
###3063 can't say in that diction, now matter if you're imitating
###3065 Kerouac or whoever it is.
###3067 So that is a holy moment for a young writer, when you start
###3071 getting full body impatient with your mentor.
###3074 But I did, from him, I think, just minimalism--
###3078 just cutting, cutting, cutting, cutting, making sure
###3080 that as much as you can help it, you're not on auto pilot.
###3086 It was a dark and cloudy day.
###3088 Ugh.
###3089 Really?
###3090 So to just lean into the sentence the way he did.
###3093 And make sure that the sentence is not only a
###3095 sentence but it actually can become a thing in the world
###3098 itself in a certain way.
###3099 AUDIENCE: Do you think that this style it
###3101 represents his time?
###3102 It's not something you can use anymore?
###3105 Because [INAUDIBLE]
###3107 a certain figure of people [INAUDIBLE].
###3110 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah, for me, what I got tired of in
###3112 Hemingway was that he, in his later work especially, he
###3115 wasn't funny.
###3116 He didn't have any sense of humor actually.
###3118 He knew very well who the noble, interesting
###3120 people were and so on.
###3122 And my life was not--
###3124 I never lived a Hemingwayesque moment really.
###3127 I remember as a young kid coming out of a funeral-- a
###3132 very sad, terrible thing.
###3136 But the funeral was being held in a mock Georgian mansion--
###3139 one of those mansions that had been put up just to be a
###3141 funeral parlor.
###3142 And then you walk out of that, and everyone's
###3144 crying and it's terrible.
###3145 And across the street, there's a Chuck E Cheese.
###3148 And the mouse is on break.
###3150 And he's on the side of the building with his head off.
###3152 And he's smoking.
###3154 So that moment could not show up in Hemingway.
###3156 He couldn't do it.
###3157 He had a stylistic cave he had made for himself.
###3161 And I thought, that's where the gateway to style is.
###3164 And when you see something in your life, in your heart, in
###3166 your world that the style of your hero can't accommodate,
###3170 then it's a time for growth.
###3173 MALE SPEAKER: I'm afraid we're out of time.
###3173 But I just want to say thank you for coming.
###3176 GEORGE SAUNDERS: Thank you very much--
###3177 appreciate it.
###3178 [APPLAUSE]
