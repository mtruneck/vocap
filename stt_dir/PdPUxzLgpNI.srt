OKAY, RBI AND SOFTBALL, WHAT'S
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO?


19
0:1:1,18 --> 0:1:4,629

RBI HAS A BASEBALL PROGRAM AS

0:1:4,629 --> 0:1:7,74
WELL AS A SOFTBALL PROGRAM, AND
THE SOFTBALL, OF COURSE, IS FOR

0:1:7,74 --> 0:1:10,99

0:1:14,56 --> 0:1:17,6

0:1:17,6 --> 0:1:21,34
AND WITH THE GALS, AS THEY GROW

0:1:21,34 --> 0:1:23,74

0:1:23,74 --> 0:1:27,1
NOW, I GOT TO TELL YOU, I'M KIND

0:1:33,299 --> 0:1:35,0
BACKGROUND IS REALLY OUT IN THE
FIELD, ISN'T IT?


30
0:1:35,0 --> 0:1:36,939
>> IT IS ON THE FIELD AND
SPEAKING OF THE FITNESS CENTER,


31
0:1:36,939 --> 0:1:39,3
I HEARD YOU'VE BEEN SPENDING
SOME TIME OVER AT NORFOLK


32

>> YEAH, I HEARD YOU OVER THERE
BREAKING RECORDS AND ALL KINDS


34
0:1:44,189 --> 0:1:48,46
OF STUFF.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, I MADE A


35
0:1:48,46 --> 0:1:51,13
COMMITMENT BECAUSE YOU GUYS KEEP
COMING ON THE SOFA AND


36
0:1:51,13 --> 0:1:54,54
HARANGUING ME ABOUT NOT GETTING
OUT THERE AND PLAYING SOFTBALL,


37
0:1:54,54 --> 0:1:56,369
BUT I'M NOT READY.
>> YOU ARE READY.


38
0:1:56,369 --> 0:2:0,79
>> MY WIFE TAKES ME BALLROOM
DANCING, I GET WINDED, SO I WENT

0:2:0,79 --> 0:2:3,15
AHEAD AND WENT WITH IT AS PART
OF OUR HEALTHY NORFOLK

0:2:3,15 --> 0:2:5,56
INITIATIVES A I'M GOING TO START

0:2:5,56 --> 0:2:10,8
THE VIEWERS SEE IT AND IT'S ON
THIS WEEK AND IF I CAN DO IT,


42
0:2:10,8 --> 0:2:14,56
ANYBODY CAN DO IT.

THAT.
RBI.


51
0:2:34,65 --> 0:2:39,18
>> IT'S THE INITIATIVE IF MAJOR
LEAGUE BASEBALL.


52
0:2:39,18 --> 0:2:41,23
>> THAT'S THE BIG-LEAGUE GUYS.
>> YES, SIR, REVITALIZING


53
0:2:41,23 --> 0:2:44,97
BASEBALL IN THE CITY AND THE KEY
IS TO GET INNER CITY KIDS BACK


54
0:2:44,97 --> 0:2:47,8
INTO BASEBALL.
IT'S GREAT.


55
0:2:47,8 --> 0:2:51,66
THEY HAVE A BUNCH OF RESOURCES
FOR US TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND NOT


56
0:2:51,66 --> 0:2:55,129
JUST BASEBALL AS WE SPOKE ABOUT
EARLIER, IT'S SOFTBALL AS WELL


57
0:2:55,129 --> 0:3:0,53
AND FOR AGES 5 TO 17.
AND IT'S A GREAT TIME.


58
0:3:0,53 --> 0:3:3,31
AND THE KIDS WHO ARE SUCCESSFUL
WITH THE TEAMS, THEY HAVE AN


59
0:3:3,31 --> 0:3:6,709
OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE ON TO
NATIONAL TOURNAMENTS, SO, YEAH.


60
0:3:6,709 --> 0:3:8,9
>> THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF.
>> YES, SIR.


61
0:3:8,9 --> 0:3:11,84
THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY
IN NATIONAL TOURNAMENTS SO IT


62
0:3:11,84 --> 0:3:14,84
GIVES OUR KIDS THE TYPE OF
EXPOSURE TO GET THEM TO THE NEXT


63
0:3:14,84 --> 0:3:16,12
LEVEL.
>> BECAUSE I REMEMBER GOING TO


64
0:3:16,12 --> 0:3:18,519
THE, YOU KNOW, BASICALLY FIELD
AND THE LOCAL NEIGHBORHOOD AND


65
0:3:18,519 --> 0:3:20,72
WE DID THE WHOLE THING ABOUT
FOLLOWING THE BAT.


66
0:3:20,72 --> 0:3:23,41
AND I WAS ALWAYS LAST ONE OUT
BECAUSE I WAS BAT BOY.


67
0:3:23,41 --> 0:3:25,59
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT
KIND OF INFORMAL PICK-UP GAME.


68
0:3:25,59 --> 0:3:29,73
>> NO, SIR, THIS IS LIKE ANY
OTHER REGULAR LITTLE LEAGUE


69
0:3:29,73 --> 0:3:34,5
BASEBALL, BUT THIS IS SPONSORED
BY MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL SO


70
0:3:34,5 --> 0:3:39,75
WE'VE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO US
THAT OTHER LEAGUES DON'T HAVE.


71
0:3:39,75 --> 0:3:43,269
FOR INSTANCE, WE MAY HAVE
OPPORTUNITY TO TRAVEL AND PLAY


72
0:3:43,269 --> 0:3:47,42
AGAINST DIFFERENT RBI TEAMS IN
NORTH CAROLINA OR IN FLORIDA,


73
0:3:47,42 --> 0:3:51,83
YOU KNOW, SO IT'S GREAT.
AND PLUS WE ALSO HAVE, YOU KNOW,


74
0:3:51,83 --> 0:3:54,209
MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL PLAYERS
WHO WILL COME BACK AND SPEAK TO


75
0:3:54,209 --> 0:3:57,79
OUR KIDS, SO WE HAVE TRAINING
AND STUFF LIKE THAT.


76
0:3:57,79 --> 0:3:58,34
>> COOL.
WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT


77
0:3:58,34 --> 0:4:1,29
TRAVELING TO NORTH CAROLINA,
THAT GETS EXPENSIVE, WON'T IT?


78
0:4:1,29 --> 0:4:4,489
>> IT CAN, BUT LIKE I SAID, THE
RESOURCES THAT MAJOR BASEBALL


79
0:4:4,489 --> 0:4:10,19
PROVIDE, THEY ALSO GIVE US
FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO TAKE SOME


80
0:4:10,19 --> 0:4:11,379
OF THESE TRIPS.
>> OKAY.


81
0:4:11,379 --> 0:4:14,22
SO REALLY, IT'S OPENING IT UP TO
KIDS WHO MAY NOT THINK THEY HAVE


82
0:4:14,22 --> 0:4:17,65
A CHANCE BECAUSE OF THEIR
CIRCUMSTANCES INSTEAD OF THEIR


83
0:4:17,65 --> 0:4:19,189
TALENT.
>> CIRCUMSTANCES, KIDS THAT VENT


84
0:4:19,189 --> 0:4:21,589
BEEN EXPOSED TO BASEBALL, YOU
KNOW.


85
0:4:21,589 --> 0:4:24,219
RIGHT NOW, BEING COMPLETELY
HONEST WITH YOU, FOOTBALL AND


86
0:4:24,219 --> 0:4:27,55
BASKETBALL IS KIND OF LIKE
RULING IN SPORTS RIGHT NOW.


87
0:4:27,55 --> 0:4:28,65
>> I KNOW.
>> AND THERE ARE OTHER


88
0:4:28,65 --> 0:4:34,419
OPPORTUNITIES, BASEBALL, TENNIS,
LACROSSE, SOCCER, ALL THOSE


89
0:4:34,419 --> 0:4:37,529
SPORTS THAT I THINK THEY NEED TO
BE EXPOSED TO AND THIS IS JUST


90
0:4:37,529 --> 0:4:40,499
ONE WAY WE CAN GET GOING IN THIS
PARTICULAR SPORT, WHICH IS


91
0:4:40,499 --> 0:4:43,89
BASEBALL, AND I MEAN, IT'S A
GREAT DEAL.


92
0:4:43,89 --> 0:4:44,929
YOU'RE BACKED BY MAJOR LEAGUE
BASEBALL, SO --


93
0:4:44,929 --> 0:4:48,559
>> SO ALL THE SPORTS YOU TALK
ABOUT, WE CAN GET PLUGGED INTO


94
0:4:48,559 --> 0:4:50,37
AT THE REC CENTER.
>> YES, SIR.


95
0:4:50,37 --> 0:4:52,18
>> SO IT'S REALLY SIMPLE AND A
LOT OF OUR REC CENTERS ARE


96
0:4:52,18 --> 0:4:54,59
WALKING DISTANCE FROM
EVERYBODY'S HOUSE.


97
0:4:54,59 --> 0:4:55,339
>> YES.
>> IN ORDER TO GET PLUGGED INTO


98
0:4:55,339 --> 0:4:58,49
RBI, HOW DO THEY GO ABOUT DOING
THAT.


99
0:4:58,49 --> 0:5:3,55
>> CALL LAKEWOOD, AND WE'RE
GOING TO HAVE A REGISTRATION

A GAL.
\M [ SINGING ] \M


124
0:6:47,859 --> 0:6:52,33
>> 60 MINUTES OF PHYSICAL
ACTIVITY A DAY AND EATING WELL


125
0:6:52,33 --> 0:6:55,689
CAN HELP GET YOUR CHILD HEALTHY.
SO KEEP THEM ACTIVE AND EATING

WELL EVERY DAY.
GET IDEAS, GET INVOLVED, GET


127
0:6:59,55 --> 0:7:7,259
GOING, AT LET'S MOVE.GOV.
>>> 
WELCOME BACK TO NORFOLK


128
0:7:7,259 --> 0:7:10,69
PERSPECTIVES.
I'M CONFUSED BECAUSE THE PERSON


129
0:7:10,69 --> 0:7:14,399
SITTING ON THE SOFA I KNOW FOR A
LONG TIME, JANET WILLIAMS,


130
0:7:14,399 --> 0:7:18,58
YOU'VE BEEN IN HUMAN RESOURCES,
BEEN IN PUBLIC WORKS, BEEN IN


131
0:7:18,58 --> 0:7:21,59
I.T., AND NOW YOU'RE IN
RECREATION, PARKS AND OPEN


132
0:7:21,59 --> 0:7:23,669
SPACE.
I CAN'T THINK OF A BROADER-BASED


133
0:7:23,669 --> 0:7:26,529
PERSON HAVING EXPERIENCE.
OH, AND THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE.


134
0:7:26,529 --> 0:7:29,86
WHAT ELSE DID I MISS?
>> MANAGER'S OFFICE.


135
0:7:29,86 --> 0:7:32,879
>> MANAGER'S OFFICE.
>> AND GRANTS.


136
0:7:32,879 --> 0:7:35,59
>> AND GRANTS.
AND NOW YOU'VE BEEN KIND OF THE


137
0:7:35,59 --> 0:7:40,789
LEADER OF NEL.
FIRST OF ALL, WHAT IS THAT.


138
0:7:40,789 --> 0:7:44,489
>> IT STANDS FOR NORFOLK
EMERGING LEADERS PROGRAM.


139
0:7:44,489 --> 0:7:50,69
>> YOU HAVE THE POSITION DOWN?
>> YEAH, WHICH MEANS REACHING


140
0:7:50,69 --> 0:7:52,339
FORWARD WHILE PULLING SOMEONE
ALONG.


141
0:7:52,339 --> 0:7:55,59
>> THERE WE GO.
>> THAT'S WHAT IT IS NOW, BUT


142
0:7:55,59 --> 0:7:57,8
IT'S BEEN IN EXISTENCE ABOUT SIX
TO SEVEN YEARS.


143
0:7:57,8 --> 0:8:3,249
I THINK I'VE BEEN WITH IT ABOUT
FIVE YEARS NOW AND IT'S A


144
0:8:3,249 --> 0:8:6,499
PROGRAM THAT'S REALLY STARTING
TO KIND OF CHANGE LIVES, YOU


145
0:8:6,499 --> 0:8:7,839
KNOW.
THESE PEOPLE THAT COME THROUGH


146
0:8:7,839 --> 0:8:10,759
THESE PROGRAMS, THEY END UP
WORKING IN OUR ORGANIZATION AND


147
0:8:10,759 --> 0:8:14,39
WE'RE REALLY PROUD TO BE A PART
OF NEL.


148
0:8:14,39 --> 0:8:17,349
>> BECAUSE I KNOW WE'VE TALKED
ABOUT THIS IN THE WORKPLACE.


149
0:8:17,349 --> 0:8:22,259
I MEAN, LET'S FACE IT, INTERNS
HAVE THIS REPUTATION -- OR


150
0:8:22,259 --> 0:8:24,319
INTERN PROGRAMS HAVE THIS
REPUTATION OF YOU HAVE A HIGH


151
0:8:24,319 --> 0:8:27,419
SCHOOL KID OR COLLEGE KID SHOW
UP AT THE WORKPLACE, THEY KIND


152
0:8:27,419 --> 0:8:30,219
OF SURVIVE THE SUMMER AND THEY
GO BACK TO SCHOOL.


153
0:8:30,219 --> 0:8:31,689
>> RIGHT.
>> THAT'S NOT WHAT NEL IS ABOUT,


154
0:8:31,689 --> 0:8:33,43
IS IT?
>> I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS IS


155
0:8:33,43 --> 0:8:35,86
PEOPLE NEED TO STOP THINKING
ABOUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO


156
0:8:35,86 --> 0:8:38,94
WITH YOUR YOUNG PERSON EARLIER
IN THE YEAR.


157
0:8:38,94 --> 0:8:42,93
NEL HAS TWO KEY COMPONENTS.
THE FIRST COMPONENT IS A 16 TO


158
0:8:42,93 --> 0:8:45,97
19-YEAR-OLD PROGRAM WHICH
FOCUSES ON INDIVIDUALS IN MIDDLE


159
0:8:45,97 --> 0:8:49,75
AND HIGH SCHOOL, AND EVEN THOUGH
IT'S NOT CALLED AN INTERNSHIP


160
0:8:49,75 --> 0:8:52,25
PROGRAM, WE FOCUS ON MAKING SURE
THAT THEY COME INTO OUR


161
0:8:52,25 --> 0:8:54,699
ORGANIZATION AND REALLY GET A
GOOD SENSE OF HOW LOCAL


162
0:8:54,699 --> 0:8:58,12
GOVERNMENT WORKS.
WITH THE EXECUTIVE INTERNSHIP


163
0:8:58,12 --> 0:9:1,92
PROGRAM, THAT'S FOR INDIVIDUALS
MATRICULATING THROUGH COLLEGE AT


164
0:9:1,92 --> 0:9:5,69
ANY AGE, AND THIS YEAR, WE HAVE
BROADENED THAT PROGRAM TO NOT


165
0:9:5,69 --> 0:9:8,41
ONLY HIT UNIVERSITIES AND
COLLEGES WITHIN THE STATE OF


166
0:9:8,41 --> 0:9:11,259
VIRGINIA, BUT WE HAVE ACTUALLY
OPENED IT NATIONWIDE.


167
0:9:11,259 --> 0:9:14,29
AND YOU WANT AN EXECUTIVE INTERN
AND THAT MEANS YOU REPORT TO THE


168
0:9:14,29 --> 0:9:17,41
CITY MANAGER'S OFFICE AND OUT OF
THAT OFFICE, YOU MAY BE ROUTED


169
0:9:17,41 --> 0:9:20,3
TO ANOTHER DEPARTMENT, BUT YOUR
KEY FOCUS IS YOU'RE GOING TO


170
0:9:20,3 --> 0:9:22,959
WORK ON TWO OF OUR MAJOR
INITIATIVES IN THE CITY, WHICH


171
0:9:22,959 --> 0:9:26,6
IS LIFELONG LEARNING AND
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT, SO THIS


172
0:9:26,6 --> 0:9:28,6
IS A REAL-LIFE JOB BECAUSE
BECAUSE OF THIS EXPERIENCE AS AN


173
0:9:28,6 --> 0:9:32,97
EXECUTIVE INTERN, YOU CAN BECOME
A FULL-TIME EMPLOYEE AND OUT OF


174
0:9:32,97 --> 0:9:35,62
THE NORFOLK EMERGING LEADERS
PROGRAM, YOU CAN ELEVATE AND


175
0:9:35,62 --> 0:9:40,41
BECOME AN EXECUTIVE INTERN WHEN
YOU GO THROUGH COLLEGE.


176
0:9:40,41 --> 0:9:43,339
>> WE DO FOCUS, THOUGH, ON
LOOKING AT NORFOLK RESIDENTS


177
0:9:43,339 --> 0:9:45,319
EVEN THOUGH THEY MIGHT BE GOING
TO SCHOOL THROUGHOUT THE


178
0:9:45,319 --> 0:9:46,67
COUNTRY.
>> WE LOVE TO SUPPORT OUR


179
0:9:46,67 --> 0:9:49,48
NORFOLK CITY AND OUR NORFOLK
RESIDENTS ARE PART OF WHAT MAKES


180
0:9:49,48 --> 0:9:53,75
OUR CITY GREAT AND THAT WOULD BE
SOMETHING THAT WE FEEL GOOD


181
0:9:53,75 --> 0:9:55,94
ABOUT HAVING THE INITIATIVE
FOCUS ON THAT.


182
0:9:55,94 --> 0:9:57,21
>> I'M GOING TO PUT YOU ON THE
SPOT.


183
0:9:57,21 --> 0:9:59,3
>> OKAY.
>> I REMEMBER WE TALKED ON THE


184
0:9:59,3 --> 0:10:2,729
SOFA A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHEN
THIS WAS AN IDEA.


185
0:10:2,729 --> 0:10:4,709
>> YEAH.
>> WHEN YOU MENTIONED THE IDEA


186
0:10:4,709 --> 0:10:10,79
OF NEL AND THE INTERNS AND
FULL-TIME, WE HAVE SOME CASE


187
0:10:10,79 --> 0:10:12,589
STUDIES FOR THAT THAT ARE FOR
REAL.


188
0:10:12,589 --> 0:10:16,81
LET'S TALK ABOUT BULLY VIDEO.
WHEN I SAY BULLY VIDEO, WHAT DO


189
0:10:16,81 --> 0:10:19,939
YOU THINK ABOUT?
>> I THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH


190
0:10:19,939 --> 0:10:24,839
POTENTIAL CAN 20 TO 22 STUDENTS
GET DONE IN 20 WEEKS.


191
0:10:24,839 --> 0:10:28,29
I THINK ABOUT GIVE THEM AN
ASSIGNMENT AND LET THEM DO IT


192
0:10:28,29 --> 0:10:31,389
AND STEP BACK AND SEE THEM GET
IT DONE.


193
0:10:31,389 --> 0:10:34,839
LAST YEAR THEY DEVELOPED A PSA
INITIATIVE ON AN ANTI-BULLYING


194
0:10:34,839 --> 0:10:38,199
CAMPAIGN AND THAT'S WHERE THEY
COULD HAVE STOPPED.


195
0:10:38,199 --> 0:10:40,769
THEY TOOK THAT CAMPAIGN TO
NORFOLK PUBLIC SCHOOLS, THE


196
0:10:40,769 --> 0:10:43,779
PUBLIC SCHOOL BOARD, GOT IT
APPROVED, AND TODAY IT'S PART OF


197
0:10:43,779 --> 0:10:47,12
THE CURRICULUM THAT NORFOLK
PUBLIC SCHOOLS USES AS A PART OF


198
0:10:47,12 --> 0:10:49,72
THEIR ANTI-BULLYING CAMPAIGN.
I THINK SOMETIMES YOU


199
0:10:49,72 --> 0:10:52,16
UNDERESTIMATE THE CAPACITY OF
WHAT AN INDIVIDUAL CAN DO AND


200
0:10:52,16 --> 0:10:57,329
WHEN YOU COME TO BE A NORFOLK
EMERGING LEADER OR INTERN, WE'RE


201
0:10:57,329 --> 0:10:59,709
GOING TO PUSH YOU AS FAR AS YOU
CAN GO.


202
0:10:59,709 --> 0:11:4,329
A PSA DEVELOPED IN TEN WEEKS IS
PRETTY AMAZING SO THAT'S WHAT


203
0:11:4,329 --> 0:11:6,66
THEY WERE ABLE TO DO.
>> AND PEOPLE SEE THAT PSA ON


204
0:11:6,66 --> 0:11:8,689
THIS STATION ALL THE TIME.
>> ALL THE TIME.


205
0:11:8,689 --> 0:11:11,759
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE GUY THAT
WAS KIND OF THE HUB OF IT,


206
0:11:11,759 --> 0:11:14,99
BRYCE.
>> HE CAME THROUGH OUR PROGRAM


207
0:11:14,99 --> 0:11:18,35
LAST YEAR IN 2012 AND HE
ACTUALLY WORKED IN CIVIC


208
0:11:18,35 --> 0:11:22,89
FACILITIES AND I BELIEVE HE
ACTUALLY WORKS IN COMMUNICATIONS


209
0:11:22,89 --> 0:11:25,829
RIGHT NOW, BUT KINETIC
TECHNOLOGY I THINK IS HIS MAJOR


210
0:11:25,829 --> 0:11:29,209
AND JUST ALL KINDS OF MAJORS.
BUT THE INTEREST TO BE IN


211
0:11:29,209 --> 0:11:32,79
GOVERNMENT IS WHERE BRYCE MAKES
US MOST PROUD AND HE'S SOMEONE


212
0:11:32,79 --> 0:11:35,389
WE'RE PROUD TO CALL A CITY
EMPLOYEE RIGHT NOW.


213
0:11:35,389 --> 0:11:37,699
>> IT'S REALLY COOL -- AND WE'LL
TALK ABOUT BRYCE EVEN THOUGH


214
0:11:37,699 --> 0:11:41,9
HE'S NOT HERE, BECAUSE WHAT HE
REPRESENTS IS HE WASN'T WILLING


215
0:11:41,9 --> 0:11:43,29
TO JUST STICK WITH CHECKING THE
BOX.


216
0:11:43,29 --> 0:11:44,889
>> NO.
>> HE ACTUALLY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF


217
0:11:44,889 --> 0:11:47,6
HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY,
HEY, I'VE GOT A LOT OF FIRE IN


218
0:11:47,6 --> 0:11:49,649
MY BELLY THAT I WANT TO GIVE TO
THE CITY AND WE'RE NOW SEEING


219
0:11:49,649 --> 0:11:54,389
HIS WORK ON THE STATION A LOT.
>> IT'S NOT THAT YOU GOT TO PUSH


220
0:11:54,389 --> 0:11:55,579
THEM.
YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE


221
0:11:55,579 --> 0:11:58,35
COMMUNICATION IS REALLY GOOD
WITH THEM BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE


222
0:11:58,35 --> 0:12:1,62
HAVE HIDDEN TALENTS THAT COME
INTO A JOB THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW


223
0:12:1,62 --> 0:12:4,269
WHAT TO EXPECT, THAT CAN REALLY
KIND OF BRING OUT THE BEST IN


224
0:12:4,269 --> 0:12:7,629
THEM, SO NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE
QUIET PERSON OR THE INTROVERT.


225
0:12:7,629 --> 0:12:11,389
>> I KNOW THERE'S A MOM OUT
THERE WHO SAYS MY DAUGHTER JANET


226
0:12:11,389 --> 0:12:14,829
IS GOING TO MAKE IT, SO WHAT DO
YOU HAVE TO SAY SO THAT MOM OF


227
0:12:14,829 --> 0:12:18,579
JANET?
>> THAT MOM OF JANET?


228
0:12:18,579 --> 0:12:21,279
>> WHAT SHOULD JANET BE DOING IN
ORDER TO APPLY?


229
0:12:21,279 --> 0:12:23,67
>> SHE SHOULD BE MAKING SURE
THAT SHE'S EITHER GONE TO HER


230
0:12:23,67 --> 0:12:28,949
LOCAL LIBRARY OR THE NORFOLK.GOV
WEBSITE WHERE THE NEL


231
0:12:28,949 --> 0:12:32,19
APPLICATIONS ARE, NOT ONLY THE
NORFOLK EMERGING LEADERS


232
0:12:32,19 --> 0:12:35,24
APPLICATION IS OUT THERE, BUT
THE EXECUTIVE INTERN APPLICATION


233
0:12:35,24 --> 0:12:39,97
IS OUT THERE ALSO.
THOSE APPLICATIONS WILL BE OUT


234
0:12:39,97 --> 0:12:42,769
THERE UNTIL MARCH THE 15th, SO
THIS IS A CREDIT CAM TIME RIGHT


235
0:12:42,769 --> 0:12:45,79
NOW -- CRITICAL TIME RIGHT NOW
WE'RE ASKING YOU TO THINK ABOUT


236
0:12:45,79 --> 0:12:47,56
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IN THE
SUMMER RIGHT NOW.


237
0:12:47,56 --> 0:12:51,649
>> AND WHEN YOU AND YOUR TEAM
ARE MAKING THE DECISION, IT WILL


238
0:12:51,649 --> 0:12:54,49
BE A TOUGH JOB.
>> IT WILL BE TOUGH.


239
0:12:54,49 --> 0:12:57,439
>> THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU
BROUGHT TO THE CITY, BUT ALSO TO


240
0:12:57,439 --> 0:12:59,739
OUR YOUTH IN THE COMMUNITY
INVESTING IN THE FUTURE.


241
0:12:59,739 --> 0:13:1,72
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.
>> APPRECIATE IT.


242
0:13:1,72 --> 0:13:4,1
>>> WHEN WE COME BACK, IT'S JUST
ABOUT ME BEING COOL IN THE


243
0:13:4,1 --> 0:13:9,279
SUMMER, IT'S YOU TOO WHEN YOU
COME TO CITY HALL.


244
0:13:9,279 --> 0:13:15,959
STAY TUNED.
>>> HEY, SANDRA.


245
0:13:15,959 --> 0:13:21,949
>> OH, SORRY.
I'M JUST REALLY SURPRISED AT HOW


246
0:13:21,949 --> 0:13:24,519
EXPENSIVE FOOD HAS GOTTEN.
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO PUT ASIDE


247
0:13:24,519 --> 0:13:28,199
SOME MONEY TO BUY A HOUSE, BUT
WE CAN BARELY MAKE IT FROM ONE


248
0:13:28,199 --> 0:13:30,62
CHECK TO THE NEXT.
>> I'M IN THE SAME BOAT, BUT


249
0:13:30,62 --> 0:13:34,97
WITH THE MONEY I'M GETTING FROM
THE EITC, WE'RE BETTER OFF.


250
0:13:34,97 --> 0:13:40,879
IT'S THE EARNED INCOME TAX
CREDIT.


251
0:13:40,879 --> 0:13:44,579
>> FOR MORE ON THE EITC AND FREE
TAX PREPARATION, CALL OR VISIT


252
0:13:44,579 --> 0:13:48,689
OUR WEBSITE.
>> WELCOME BACK TO NORFOLK


253
0:13:48,689 --> 0:13:51,249
PERSPECTIVES.
WE'VE GONE FROM ALL KINDS OF


254
0:13:51,249 --> 0:13:54,61
THINGS AND NOW WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT MY COMFORT AT THE OFFICE.


255
0:13:54,61 --> 0:13:56,74
IS THIS WHAT IT'S ABOUT, MY
COMFORT AT THE OFFICE?


256
0:13:56,74 --> 0:13:58,97
DENISE THOMPSON.
>> IT'S PARTLY ABOUT YOUR


257
0:13:58,97 --> 0:14:3,23
COMFORT, BOB.
ACTUALLY, IF EVERYTHING WORKS


258
0:14:3,23 --> 0:14:5,35
FINE, YOU WILL BE COMPLETELY
COMFORTABLE AND YOU WON'T EVEN


259
0:14:5,35 --> 0:14:8,48
KNOW WE'RE REDUCING COSTS AND
REDUCING OUR ENERGY USE AT THE


260
0:14:8,48 --> 0:14:10,629
SAME TIME.
>> YOU JUST TOLD ME I HAD


261
0:14:10,629 --> 0:14:14,129
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.
>> NO, YOU DO BECAUSE YOU'RE THE


262
0:14:14,129 --> 0:14:18,339
CLIENT, REALLY, OF OUR CENTRAL
ENERGY PLANT AND WE WANTED TO


263
0:14:18,339 --> 0:14:21,639
COME AND TALK WITH YOU ABOUT
IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE MADE TO THE


264
0:14:21,639 --> 0:14:24,519
CENTRAL ENERGY PLANT AND WHY,
AND HOW THAT TIES IN WITH THE


265
0:14:24,519 --> 0:14:28,5
BIG PICTURE OF SUSTAINING
NORFOLK'S ENVIRONMENT.


266
0:14:28,5 --> 0:14:30,18
>> OKAY, JERRY SPIVEY.
>> YES.


267
0:14:30,18 --> 0:14:32,629
>> NOW, YOU'RE RIGHT-OF-WAY
PROGRAM MANAGER.


268
0:14:32,629 --> 0:14:34,269
HOW DID YOU GET WRAPPED UP IN
THIS?


269
0:14:34,269 --> 0:14:37,18
>> WELL, I WEAR MANY HAT.
>> WHICH IS A LOT OF PEOPLE IN


270
0:14:37,18 --> 0:14:38,36
CITY HALL.
>> YOU HAVE TO.


271
0:14:38,36 --> 0:14:41,559
I'M A CERTIFIED ENERGY MANAGER
AND I'VE WORKED WITH DENISE


272
0:14:41,559 --> 0:14:46,959
SINCE SHE'S BEEN WITH THE CITY
ON ENERGY PROJECTS AND WE


273
0:14:46,959 --> 0:14:52,209
RECENTLY COMPLETED PURCHASE OF A
SOFTWARE CALLED ENERGY CAP AND


274
0:14:52,209 --> 0:14:56,139
WHAT WE DO WITH THAT IS WE INPUT
ALL THE UTILITY BILLS FROM ALL


275
0:14:56,139 --> 0:15:0,32
OVER THE CITY, ALL THE
DEPARTMENTS.


276
0:15:0,32 --> 0:15:2,219
>> YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF
FACILITIES.


277
0:15:2,219 --> 0:15:3,86
>> HUNDREDS.
100 BUILDINGS, 3.5 MILLION


278
0:15:3,86 --> 0:15:8,579
SQUARE FEET AND WE PUT ALL THE
INFORMATION IN, NATIONAL GAS,


279
0:15:8,579 --> 0:15:13,139
ELECTRICITY, WATER, OIL, AND
WE -- MEASURE, MANAGE AND SAVE


280
0:15:13,139 --> 0:15:16,54
IS WHAT WE LIKE TO SAY.
>> SO JERRY SAYS THERE'S A LOT


281
0:15:16,54 --> 0:15:22,69
TO BE DONE AND SHE'S A -- YEAH,
OLIVER, ARE YOU DESIGNING IT?


282
0:15:22,69 --> 0:15:24,509
>> I'M DESIGNING IT.
>> I FIGURED THAT ONE OUT?


283
0:15:24,509 --> 0:15:27,459
>> YOU FIGURED THAT ONE OUT.
>> WE CAN GO OVER THAT.


284
0:15:27,459 --> 0:15:29,97
>> I'M OVERSEEING THE
CONSTRUCTION AS WELL.


285
0:15:29,97 --> 0:15:31,86
>> CAN I BE FRANK WITH YOU GUYS?
>> ABSOLUTELY.


286
0:15:31,86 --> 0:15:35,55
>> I HAD NO IDEA THIS WAS GOING
ON.


287
0:15:35,55 --> 0:15:38,49
>> THAT'S THE WAY WE LIKE IT.
IF YOU DON'T KNOW, WE'RE DOING


288
0:15:38,49 --> 0:15:42,319
IT RIGHT.
WE DID OVER A $4 MILLION


289
0:15:42,319 --> 0:15:44,389
IMPROVEMENT OF THE CENTRAL FLANT
AND YOU DIDN'T -- PLANT AND YOU


290
0:15:44,389 --> 0:15:46,6
DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT WAS GOING
ON.


291
0:15:46,6 --> 0:15:47,679
>> CAN I ASK YOU ANOTHER
QUESTION?


292
0:15:47,679 --> 0:15:51,879
>> YOU SURE CAN.
>> WHERE'S THE CENTRAL PLANT?


293
0:15:51,879 --> 0:15:55,16
I MEAN TALK ABOUT BEHIND THE
SCENES.


294
0:15:55,16 --> 0:15:58,569
I THINK THE GUYS -- IS IT IN THE
CENTER PART OF THE CITY?


295
0:15:58,569 --> 0:16:0,449
>> IT IS NOT.
THE CENTRAL PLANT IS PROBABLY --


296
0:16:0,449 --> 0:16:2,29
JERRY, YOU CAN HELP ME WITH
THIS.


297
0:16:2,29 --> 0:16:6,19
I WOULD SAY A THOUSAND FEET
OUTSIDE THE CITY COMPLEX.


298
0:16:6,19 --> 0:16:8,149
>> BY THE CITY GARAGE.
>> OH, THE BUILDING I WALK PAST


299
0:16:8,149 --> 0:16:11,459
EVERY DAY, THAT ONE WITH STEAM
COMING OUT.


300
0:16:11,459 --> 0:16:15,209
>> THAT'S IT.
>> NOW, DOES THAT -- MYTH HAS IT


301
0:16:15,209 --> 0:16:18,68
THAT NOT ONLY CONTROLS MY
OFFICE, BUT THE OTHER


302
0:16:18,68 --> 0:16:21,35
FACILITIES?
>> THE JAIL, CITY COURT, THE


303
0:16:21,35 --> 0:16:23,649
CITY HALL.
>> I'M ASSUMING THE NEW


304
0:16:23,649 --> 0:16:25,5
COURTHOUSE IS GOING UP.
>> YES.


305
0:16:25,5 --> 0:16:27,899
>> THEY SAID FINALLY WE'RE GOING
TO BUILD SOMETHING INDEPENDENT


306
0:16:27,899 --> 0:16:30,86
OF ALL THAT.
>> THAT'S CORRECT.


307
0:16:30,86 --> 0:16:33,989
>> IT'S BEING POWERED BY THE
CENTRAL ENERGY PLANT.


308
0:16:33,989 --> 0:16:36,519
>> HEATING AND COOLING COMES
FROM THE CENTRAL PLANT FOR THE


309
0:16:36,519 --> 0:16:39,699
NEW COURTHOUSE.
>> AND THE NEW COURTHOUSE, AND


310
0:16:39,699 --> 0:16:43,99
AGAIN, THIS TIES IN WITH THE BIG
PICTURE OF SUPPORTING


311
0:16:43,99 --> 0:16:46,899
ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AND
SUSTAINABILITY AND REDUCING


312
0:16:46,899 --> 0:16:50,189
COSTS AND THE NEW COURTHOUSE
BEEN A LEED CERTIFIED BUILDING,


313
0:16:50,189 --> 0:16:53,98
WHICH MEANS LEADERSHIP IN ENERGY
AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN AND IT


314
0:16:53,98 --> 0:16:58,189
WILL HAVE SPECIAL ENERGY-SAVING
FEATURES, RECYCLED MATERIALS


315
0:16:58,189 --> 0:17:1,879
FEATURES.
IT'S LOCATED NEAR TRANSIT, SO


316
0:17:1,879 --> 0:17:4,2
THAT'S A GOOD THING.
WE HAVE LOTS OF LEED BUILDINGS


317
0:17:4,2 --> 0:17:5,5
IN NORFOLK.
>> SO HOW ARE YOU ABLE TO PULL


318
0:17:5,5 --> 0:17:8,76
THAT OFF WITH A PLANT -- I'M
ASSUMING PLANT WAS BUILT ABOUT


319
0:17:8,76 --> 0:17:11,22
THE SAME TIME CITY HALL WAS,
WHICH WAS BEFORE DENISE WAS


320
0:17:11,22 --> 0:17:14,91
BORN.
>> THANK YOU, BOB.


321
0:17:14,91 --> 0:17:20,2
>> 1965, RIGHT?
YEAH, IT WAS BUILT AROUND 1965,


322
0:17:20,2 --> 0:17:23,839
SO SOME WOULD SAY, TEAR IT DOWN,
REPLACE IT WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY.


323
0:17:23,839 --> 0:17:25,38
IT DOESN'T WORK THAT DAY, DOES
IT?


324
0:17:25,38 --> 0:17:28,309
>> WELL, WE HAD A REALLY GOOD
PLANT AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO TALK


325
0:17:28,309 --> 0:17:29,57
ABOUT SOME OF THE INNOVATIVE
FEATURES.


326
0:17:29,57 --> 0:17:31,84
>> LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
HOW THE PLANT WORKS AND I'M


327
0:17:31,84 --> 0:17:34,46
GOING TO KEEP IT SIMPLE.
>> PLEASE, BECAUSE I'M DOING


328
0:17:34,46 --> 0:17:37,75
THIS TO MY THERMOSTAT.
>> WE'VE BASICALLY HAD PIPES


329
0:17:37,75 --> 0:17:41,299
THAT RUN FROM THE CENTRAL PLANT.
>> I'VE BEEN IN THE TUNNEL.


330
0:17:41,299 --> 0:17:43,419
>> EXACTLY.
OVER TO THE VARIOUS BUILDINGS,


331
0:17:43,419 --> 0:17:49,1
CITY HALL, THE JAIL, THE COURT,
AND THEY SUPPLY COLD WATER AND


332
0:17:49,1 --> 0:17:54,2
HOT WATER AND THE PIPES SEND
THAT WATER THROUGH COILS THAT


333
0:17:54,2 --> 0:17:57,45
ARE IN AIR HANDLING UNITS AND
THAT DISTRIBUTES THE COLD AIR OR


334
0:17:57,45 --> 0:18:0,149
HOT AIR IN THE BUILDING.
WELL, WHAT WE DID WAS WE


335
0:18:0,149 --> 0:18:3,61
BASICALLY TOOK THAT EXISTING
INFRASTRUCTURE AND IMPROVED IT.


336
0:18:3,61 --> 0:18:9,11
WE PUT IN MORE EFFICIENT MOTORS,
MORE EFFICIENT CHILLERS, ADDED


337
0:18:9,11 --> 0:18:12,19
BOILERS, ADDED DIGITAL CONTROLS
TO THAT EQUIPMENT.


338
0:18:12,19 --> 0:18:16,559
SO THAT'S THE WAY WE TOOK THAT
1965 TECHNOLOGY AND BROUGHT IT


339
0:18:16,559 --> 0:18:18,59
UP TO DATE.
>> NOW, I REMEMBER SITTING IN


340
0:18:18,59 --> 0:18:20,169
COMMITTEE MEETINGS WITH YOU,
DENISE, SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHEN


341
0:18:20,169 --> 0:18:24,1
THE MANAGER CAME ON BOARD AND
REALLY LOOKED AT DOING THIS KIND


342
0:18:24,1 --> 0:18:26,929
OF STUFF AND BIG BUCKS CAN BE
SAVED.


343
0:18:26,929 --> 0:18:28,98
>> ABSOLUTELY, AS OPPOSED TO
STARTING FROM SCRATCH AND


344
0:18:28,98 --> 0:18:31,279
BUILDING A WHOLE NEW PLANT.
>> BUT NEVER ONCE DID I HEAR YOU


345
0:18:31,279 --> 0:18:34,36
TALK ABOUT BRINGING A SWEATER TO
WORK.


346
0:18:34,36 --> 0:18:39,29
I THOUGHT CONSERVING ENERGY IN
THE WINTER MEANT GETTING COLD.


347
0:18:39,29 --> 0:18:40,83
>> NO, NO, NO.
ON YOU SOMETIMES HEAR PEOPLE --


348
0:18:40,83 --> 0:18:43,23
YOU SOMETIMES HEAR PEOPLE
TALKING ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT


349
0:18:43,23 --> 0:18:49,649
AND SUSTAINABILITY, THEY SAY
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE, PLANET AND


350
0:18:49,649 --> 0:18:53,25
POCKETBOOK.
SO THE GOAL IS FOR YOU TO BE


351
0:18:53,25 --> 0:18:57,99
COMFORTABLE AND PRODUCTIVE AND
FOR IT NOT TO COST A LOT, FOR US


352
0:18:57,99 --> 0:19:2,789
TO CONTINUE TO USE LESS ENERGY
AND THAT THEN KEEPS THE COST


353
0:19:2,789 --> 0:19:7,789
DOWN, AND TO -- BY USING LESS
ENERGY, WE'RE -- WE'VE GOT LESS


354
0:19:7,789 --> 0:19:10,639
OF AN IMPACT, LESS OF A CARBON
FOOTPRINT ON THE PLANET.


355
0:19:10,639 --> 0:19:13,2
>> IT'S KIND OF COOL BECAUSE I
GOT TO TELL YOU, WHEN I GO IN


356
0:19:13,2 --> 0:19:16,11
THE MEN'S ROOM, I DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT TURNING THE LIGHTS


357
0:19:16,11 --> 0:19:17,309
ON AND OFF.
>> IT'S MAGIC.


358
0:19:17,309 --> 0:19:20,82
>> HOW DO THEY KNOW I'M THERE?
>> I LOVE AUTOMATION.


359
0:19:20,82 --> 0:19:25,49
THEY DO KNOW YOU'RE THERE AND
THEY TURN OFF AFTER ABOUT 10 OR


360
0:19:25,49 --> 0:19:27,61
15 MINUTES DEPENDING ON HOW
THEY'RE SET AND THAT WAS A


361
0:19:27,61 --> 0:19:29,94
WONDERFUL -- THAT WAS OLIVER'S
PROJECT.


362
0:19:29,94 --> 0:19:31,58
THAT WAS A WONDERFUL
APPLICATION.


363
0:19:31,58 --> 0:19:34,919
>> YOUR PROJECT?
>> YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT


364
0:19:34,919 --> 0:19:36,18
THAT.
>> WONDERFUL TECHNOLOGY.


365
0:19:36,18 --> 0:19:38,409
>> IS THAT THE KIND OF THING
WE'RE SEEING INCORPORATED


366
0:19:38,409 --> 0:19:40,86
NATURALLY INTO THE NEW
COURTHOUSE, RIGHT?


367
0:19:40,86 --> 0:19:42,89
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> AND WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT


368
0:19:42,89 --> 0:19:44,22
UNTIL THEN.
I'VE BEEN OVER TO THE FITNESS


369
0:19:44,22 --> 0:19:50,489
CENTER, AS WE ALL HEARD, AND
SOME OF THE NEW ONES --


370
0:19:50,489 --> 0:19:53,529
>> YES, WE'RE PUTTING THOSE IN
FACILITIES NOW.


371
0:19:53,529 --> 0:19:55,96
WHEN WE GO IN, WE'RE DOING
RENOVATIONS, ESPECIALLY IN


372
0:19:55,96 --> 0:20:0,6
RESTROOMS AND CONFERENCE ROOMS
THAT ARE NOT ATTENDED OFTEN AND


373
0:20:0,6 --> 0:20:2,9
THAT'S THE PRIME OPPORTUNITY TO
HAVE THOSE TYPE OF FEATURES.


374
0:20:2,9 --> 0:20:8,8
>> I WAS AT LAMBERT'S POINT AND
THE WHOLE GYM, WALKED IN AND THE


375
0:20:8,8 --> 0:20:11,49
SAME, WHATEVER IT IS, ELF.
>> ABSOLUTELY.


376
0:20:11,49 --> 0:20:13,779
>> THE LIGHTS CAME ON.
>> IT'S A FABULOUS TECHNOLOGY


377
0:20:13,779 --> 0:20:16,76
BECAUSE IF THE LIGHTS ARE LEFT
ON INADVERTENTLY ALL NIGHT LONG,


378
0:20:16,76 --> 0:20:20,59
YOU'RE BURNING WHAT?
EIGHT, 10, 12, 14 HOURS OF


379
0:20:20,59 --> 0:20:25,35
ENERGY FOR NOTHING.
>> BUT DENISE, LET'S BE CANDID.


380
0:20:25,35 --> 0:20:28,46
WE HAVE THE MONEY IN THE BUDGET.
DOESN'T IT JUST WORK THAT WAY?


381
0:20:28,46 --> 0:20:32,389
YOU BUDGET FOR ENERGY.
WHAT'S THE PUSH?


382
0:20:32,389 --> 0:20:38,24
>> NO, NO, BECAUSE YOU BUDGET SO
THAT YOU CAN MEET YOUR NEEDS AS


383
0:20:38,24 --> 0:20:40,919
WELL AS MEET THE NEEDS OF THE
FUTURE.


384
0:20:40,919 --> 0:20:46,669
SO WE'RE IN A TIME WHEN WE'RE
ALL LOOKING AT THE BUDGET AND IF


385
0:20:46,669 --> 0:20:50,33
THERE'S PLACES THAT WE COULD
SAVE MONEY AT THE SAME TIME THAT


386
0:20:50,33 --> 0:20:54,32
WE CAN MEET OUR GOALS, THEN YOU
DON'T -- YOU DON'T WANT A BUDGET


387
0:20:54,32 --> 0:20:57,73
THAT'S HIGHER THAN YOU NEED.
WHY WOULD YOU -- WE COULD SPEND


388
0:20:57,73 --> 0:21:1,7
THAT MONEY ON SCHOOLS, SPEND
THAT MONEY ON BIKE RACKS, SPEND


389
0:21:1,7 --> 0:21:4,13
THAT MONEY OR NOT SPEND THAT
MONEY AND KEEP OUR TAX RATES


390
0:21:4,13 --> 0:21:4,929
DOWN.
>> YOU SOUND LIKE THE PEOPLE I


391
0:21:4,929 --> 0:21:6,53
HEARD AT THE COMMUNITY
CONVERSATION.


392
0:21:6,53 --> 0:21:8,63
>> I KNOW.
>> I JUST GOT THE WRAP-UP TIME,


393
0:21:8,63 --> 0:21:12,249
BUT YOU SAID THIS HAD A LOT TO
DO WITH THE COURTHOUSE.


394
0:21:12,249 --> 0:21:17,89
>> WE BROUGHT THIS FOR YOU.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE OLD


395
0:21:17,89 --> 0:21:20,179
PART OF THE PLANT DOES AND PART
OF THE REASON WE KEPT IT IS WE


396
0:21:20,179 --> 0:21:23,71
CHILL WATER AT NIGHT IN THE
SUMMERTIME WHEN THE RATES ARE


397
0:21:23,71 --> 0:21:27,26
LOW AND THEN WE USE THAT WATER
TO COOL OUR FACILITIES.


398
0:21:27,26 --> 0:21:30,299
AND IT'S A GIANT THERMOS, SO --
>> I THINK OF THE THREE OF YOU


399
0:21:30,299 --> 0:21:31,83
GUYS EVERY TIME I DRINK OUT OF
IT.


400
0:21:31,83 --> 0:21:32,899
THANK YOU.
>> YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.


401
0:21:32,899 --> 0:21:35,309
>> THANKS FOR KEEPING US ON THE
LEADING EDGE BY BEING LEED.


402
0:21:35,309 --> 0:21:38,95
>>> WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'LL
TALK ABOUT THE PARTY EVERYBODY


403
0:21:38,95 --> 0:21:57,519
KNOWS ABOUT, THE OESHVIEW PARADE
BY THE KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS.


404
0:21:57,519 --> 0:22:9,96
STAY TUNED.
>>> THE AVERAGE TEXT TAKES YOUR


405
0:22:9,96 --> 0:22:16,279
EYES OFF THE ROAD FOR NEARLY
FIVE SECONDS.


406
0:22:16,279 --> 0:22:30,9
[ SOUNDS OF CRASH ]
>>> WELCOME BACK TO NORFOLK


407
0:22:30,9 --> 0:22:32,549
PERSPECTIVES.
OKAY, WE'RE READY TO ROLL OUT


408
0:22:32,549 --> 0:22:39,94
THE BIGGEST, THE BEST PARADE IN
MARCH IN OCEAN VIEW EVER, RIGHT?


409
0:22:39,94 --> 0:22:44,899
>> SATURDAY, MARCH 16th, 10:00,
NORTH SIDE MIDDLE SCHOOL AT


410
0:22:44,899 --> 0:22:49,46

CONGRESSMAN SCOTT RICHELLE WILL

0:22:49,46 --> 0:22:53,32
BE CUTTING THE TAPE AND THE
PARADE STARTS NORTH ON GRANBY


412
0:22:53,32 --> 0:22:56,8
STREET.
>> AND CARL, YOU ARE THE MEDIA

0:22:56,8 --> 0:22:59,669
COMMUNITY LIAISON WITH THAT, AND
IF WE TELL PEOPLE THAT'S WHEN


414
0:22:59,669 --> 0:23:2,419
THEY NEED TO BE THERE, THEY'RE
GOING TO MISS THE PARADE.


415
0:23:2,419 --> 0:23:6,29
>> WE TELL PEOPLE TO GET THERE
EARLY, GET THEIR PARKING, BE


416
0:23:6,29 --> 0:23:9,659
RESPECTFUL OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
PARKING SITUATION.


417
0:23:9,659 --> 0:23:13,35
THERE ARE PARKING LOTS TO THE
NORTH PART OF THE CITY ALONG THE


418
0:23:13,35 --> 0:23:17,549
BEACHFRONT THERE, BUT GET THERE
EARLY BECAUSE PARKING IS VERY


419
0:23:17,549 --> 0:23:18,69
LIMITED.
>> IT'S PRIME.


420
0:23:18,69 --> 0:23:23,29
JIMMY ROGERS, YOU'RE THE CHAIR,
THE ONE PULLING ALL THE STRINGS


421
0:23:23,29 --> 0:23:26,279
AND MAKING IT WORK.
>> I KIND OF DIRECT EVERYBODY


422
0:23:26,279 --> 0:23:32,159
AND MAKES SURE IT GETS DONE.
>> IN FULL DISCLOSURE, AS HOST


423
0:23:32,159 --> 0:23:34,59
OF THE SHOW, I HAVE A LOT OF
FUN, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY


424
0:23:34,59 --> 0:23:37,23
BETWEEN TAPES SHOWS, I HAVE THE
PLEASURE OF WORKING WITH GUYS


425
0:23:37,23 --> 0:23:40,39
LIKE YOU AND WE'VE BEEN SPENDING
THE LAST -- YOU'VE BEEN SPENDING


426
0:23:40,39 --> 0:23:42,59
THE LAST YEAR GETTING READY FOR
THIS PARADE, RIGHT?


427
0:23:42,59 --> 0:23:46,95
>> YES.
JIMMY CALLED EVERYBODY TO WORK,


428
0:23:46,95 --> 0:23:52,21
RIGHT BACK IN LATE JUNE AND
WE'VE BEEN MEETING WITHIN THE


429
0:23:52,21 --> 0:23:54,74
PARADE COMMITTEE ITSELF, WE'VE
BEEN MEETING WITH THE CIVIC


430
0:23:54,74 --> 0:23:59,429
LEAGUES IN THE COMMUNITY TO GET
THE THEME AND ISSUES THAT WE


431
0:23:59,429 --> 0:24:3,129
WANTED TO ADDRESS WITH THE
PARADE, AND IT'S A LOT OF WORK.


432
0:24:3,129 --> 0:24:5,49
>> YEAH, BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE --
JIMMY, HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN


433
0:24:5,49 --> 0:24:8,19
CHAIRMAN OF THE PARADE?
>> ALMOST TEN YEARS.


434
0:24:8,19 --> 0:24:10,82
>> SO YOU FORGOT WHEN THEY SOLD
YOU THE BILL OF GOODS ABOUT


435
0:24:10,82 --> 0:24:13,37
CHAIRING THIS --
>> ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS BE


436
0:24:13,37 --> 0:24:15,559
THERE.
>> JUST SHOW UP AND PUNCH


437
0:24:15,559 --> 0:24:16,2
TICKETS, RIGHT?
>> YEAH.


438
0:24:16,2 --> 0:24:20,1
>> HOW DO YOU PULL IT OFF?
>> WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE


439
0:24:20,1 --> 0:24:23,799
CITY, THE CULTURAL EVENTS
DEPARTMENT AND THEY HELP US WITH


440
0:24:23,799 --> 0:24:28,24
ALL THE OPERATIONS THE CITY
WOULD TAKE CARE OF, SO POLICE,


441
0:24:28,24 --> 0:24:32,87
TRAFFIC, GETTING THE PERMITS AND
ALL THE THINGS THAT WE NEED IN


442
0:24:32,87 --> 0:24:36,97
THAT AREA, BUT THEN WE WORK WITH
PEOPLE, THE SHRINERS ARE A BIG


443
0:24:36,97 --> 0:24:39,919
PART OF OUR PARADE.
THEY BRING A LOT -- THEY ARE


444
0:24:39,919 --> 0:24:42,909
PARADE PEOPLE AND THEN WE ALSO
HAVE OTHER GROUPS AND


445
0:24:42,909 --> 0:24:45,779
ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE
CITY AND THE ENTIRE HAMPTON


446
0:24:45,779 --> 0:24:49,48
ROADS AREA THAT WANT TO BE PART
OF IT, BUT WE TRY TO BRING


447
0:24:49,48 --> 0:24:53,679
SOMETHING THAT'S NOT ONLY
ENTERTAINING, BUT INFORMATIONAL


448
0:24:53,679 --> 0:24:56,26
TO THE PUBLIC.
>> YEAH, I GOT TO -- I'M NOT


449
0:24:56,26 --> 0:24:59,32
SURE IF I SHARED THIS, BUT I HAD
THE PLEASURE OF DRIVING IN THE


450
0:24:59,32 --> 0:25:2,279
PARADE IN 2004.
MY DAUGHTER WAS MISS NORFOLK,


451
0:25:2,279 --> 0:25:5,6
AND SO WE WERE IN THE PARADE.
YOU GUYS PUT US BACK BY THE FIRE


452
0:25:5,6 --> 0:25:8,72
TRUCK, BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY.
BUT BY THE END OF THE PARADE,


453
0:25:8,72 --> 0:25:11,12
SHE HAD BEEN PROPOSED TO SIX
TIMES.


454
0:25:11,12 --> 0:25:13,539
>> I BELIEVE IT.
>> SHE DIDN'T ACCEPT ANY OF


455
0:25:13,539 --> 0:25:16,85
THEM, BUT THE PEOPLE, THE
CROWDS, IT'S A


456
0:25:16,85 --> 0:25:19,57
COMMUNITY-BUILDING EVENT.
>> WE HEAR ALL THE TIME THROUGH


457
0:25:19,57 --> 0:25:22,399
THE CIVIC LEAGUES AND THE
COMMUNITY PEOPLE, IT'S A REUNION


458
0:25:22,399 --> 0:25:27,35
TIME AND ALSO TIMED AROUND THE
SPRING BREAKS OF THE COLLEGES SO


459
0:25:27,35 --> 0:25:32,25
A LOT OF YOUNG STUDENTS ARE BACK
IN THEIR -- WHERE THEY'RE FROM


460
0:25:32,25 --> 0:25:34,84
AND THEY COME TO THE PARADE.
IT'S A BIG REUNION.


461
0:25:34,84 --> 0:25:38,94
>> BUT THE COMMUNITY HAS REALLY
TAKEN OWNERSHIP OF THIS PARADE.


462
0:25:38,94 --> 0:25:42,11
THEY WANT TO BE A PART OF IT,
AND MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT


463
0:25:42,11 --> 0:25:45,25
WATCH IT HAVE AT ONE TIME
ACTUALLY BEEN IN THE PARADE, SO


464
0:25:45,25 --> 0:25:46,679
THAT HELPS ADD TO THE
EXCITEMENT.


465
0:25:46,679 --> 0:25:49,59
>> NOW, LAST YEAR WAS A BANNER
YEAR BECAUSE IT HAPPENED TO FALL


466
0:25:49,59 --> 0:25:53,7
ON THE ACTUAL DAY.
THIS YEAR, IT'S --


467
0:25:53,7 --> 0:25:56,419
>> THE 16th.
>> THE DAY BEFORE.


468
0:25:56,419 --> 0:25:59,11
>> BUT WHAT I'M LEARNING IS IT
DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S THE DAY


469
0:25:59,11 --> 0:26:3,29
OF, THE DAY BEFORE, THE WEEK
BEFORE, THE IRISH KNOW HOW TO


470
0:26:3,29 --> 0:26:5,389
PARTY, BUT DO WE HAVE THAT MANY
IRISHMEN IN NORFOLK?


471
0:26:5,389 --> 0:26:7,299
>>S A PAERGE WE DO BECAUSE --
APPARENTLY WE DO BECAUSE THEY


472
0:26:7,299 --> 0:26:12,389
ALL COME OUT, BUT THE ENTHUSIASM
EVERY YEAR, SOMETIMES THE PARADE


473
0:26:12,389 --> 0:26:16,159
IS THREE OR FOUR DAYS BEFORE
ST. PATRICK'S DAY AND THEY STILL


474
0:26:16,159 --> 0:26:19,269
COME OUT AND ENJOY THEMSELVES
AND HAVE A GOOD TIME.


475
0:26:19,269 --> 0:26:21,75
>> BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE
SPECIAL EVENTS CALENDAR, YOU


476
0:26:21,75 --> 0:26:24,99
GUYS REALLY LAUNCH THE WHOLE
CELEBRATION TIME AND THEN


477
0:26:24,99 --> 0:26:29,2
THERE'S THE GREENING OF GHENT
AND THEN THERE'S A CONCERT


478
0:26:29,2 --> 0:26:32,93
DOWNTOWN THE SAME WEEKEND, SO
THERE'S A WHOLE LOT GOING ON.


479
0:26:32,93 --> 0:26:35,919
>> WE ALWAYS SAY PEOPLE ARE
TIRED OF THAT CABIN FEVER AND


480
0:26:35,919 --> 0:26:38,69
THEY CAN'T WAIT TO GET OUTSIDE
AND GET OUT IN THE PARADE AND


481
0:26:38,69 --> 0:26:41,299
MEET THEIR COMMUNITY.
>> BECAUSE I'VE NEVER MET SO


482
0:26:41,299 --> 0:26:43,679
MANY PEOPLE THAT WANTED TO PARK
IN THE MEDIAN.


483
0:26:43,679 --> 0:26:45,58
I MEAN, THAT'S JUST --
>> THEY'RE THERE THE NIGHT


484
0:26:45,58 --> 0:26:48,0
BEFORE.
>> WE'RE TRYING TO DO -- AND I


485
0:26:48,0 --> 0:26:51,1
APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENT BECAUSE
WE'RE TRYING TO -- I MEAN, KEEP


486
0:26:51,1 --> 0:26:53,769
IN MIND THAT PEOPLE LIVE IN THIS
NEIGHBORHOOD TOO.


487
0:26:53,769 --> 0:26:56,36
>> WE'VE HAD GREAT WORKING
RELATIONSHIPS WITH, AS JIM


488
0:26:56,36 --> 0:26:58,76
MENTIONED, WITH THE CITY AND
CITY OFFICIALS AND THERE'S A LOT


489
0:26:58,76 --> 0:27:1,82
OF THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN
WORKING AT AND PUBLIC WORKS THIS


490
0:27:1,82 --> 0:27:5,37
YEAR, SOME OF THE ISSUES ABOUT
CHILDREN REACHING INTO THE


491
0:27:5,37 --> 0:27:9,37
PARADE, THEY HAVE ADDED YELLOW
STRIPING ALONG THE ROADS THERE


492
0:27:9,37 --> 0:27:12,33
ON THE MEDIAN, SO AGAIN, WE'RE
REALLY ASKING PARENTS TO KEEP


493
0:27:12,33 --> 0:27:15,799
THEIR KIDS BEHIND THE YELL LO
LINE SO THEY'RE NOT IN -- YELLOW


494
0:27:15,799 --> 0:27:19,549
LINE SO THEY'RE NOT IN DANGER,
AND JUST YESTERDAY, WE MET WITH


495
0:27:19,549 --> 0:27:22,0
THE POLICE REPRESENTATIVES TO
TALK ABOUT ISSUES.


496
0:27:22,0 --> 0:27:24,38
>> SO YOU'RE REALLY CONTROLLING
IT, BUT IT'S STILL GOING TO BE


497
0:27:24,38 --> 0:27:27,47
ONE HECK OF A GOOD TIME.
>> WE TELL EVERYBODY TO COME AND


498
0:27:27,47 --> 0:27:30,289
HAVE A GOOD TIME.
>> THEY'RE RAISING THE BAR


499
0:27:30,289 --> 0:27:32,659
BECAUSE I WAS AT A MEETING THE
OTHER DAY WITH THE ANIMAL CARE


500
0:27:32,659 --> 0:27:35,559
CENTER AND THEY'RE ALL EXCITED
BECAUSE THEY'RE MOVING FROM


501
0:27:35,559 --> 0:27:37,84
TIEING TWO GROCERY CARTS
TOGETHER TO ACTUALLY HAVING A


502
0:27:37,84 --> 0:27:40,549
FLOAT IN THE PARADE.
>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE CITY


503
0:27:40,549 --> 0:27:45,85
RECYCLERS HERE, THE HAMPTON
UNIVERSITY PROTON BEAM THERAPY


504
0:27:45,85 --> 0:27:50,59
CENTER IS PUTTING ON A FLOAT.
IT'S A HAMPTON ROADS EVENT.


505
0:27:50,59 --> 0:27:52,69
>> AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
A COUPLE OF IRISHMEN.


506
0:27:52,69 --> 0:27:54,88
>> A COUPLE.
>> SO COME LOOK FOR THEM.


507
0:27:54,88 --> 0:28:1,5
YOU HAVE AN AWESOME WEBSITE.
WE HAVE A LINK AT NORFOLK.GOV,


508
0:28:1,5 --> 0:28:6,49
BUT THE LINK IS A DIRECT SITE.

509
0:28:6,49 --> 0:28:8,879
