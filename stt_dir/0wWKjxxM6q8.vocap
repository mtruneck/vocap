###4 CHARLET DUBOC: Welcome to "Fashion Week International,"
###7 the show that reports on the most fabulous fashion weeks in
###10 the world and the culture and politics behind them.
###14 This time we're in North Korea's fun Southern cousin
###17 for Seoul fashion week.
###19 
###37 It's 3:00 AM on a Monday night and I'm shopping and so is
###43 everybody else.
###46 Everything you can see around here is open.
###49 Nobody's drunk, nothing's weird.
###52 It's the same as during the day, it's just dark.
###54 
###61 This is an underground station, but as you can see it
###63 also takes you to the underground shopping center.
###66 
###71 It doesn't feel real.
###73 It's like a weird,
###74 post-apocalyptic underground world.
###79 Why is it open?
###81 Why aren't people in bed?
###82 
###85 We're definitely going to come back at a more civil hour.
###89 
###95 I was in Seoul for fashion week.
###99 Seoul is a megatropolis.
###101 A sprawling mass of perfect order, and the most
###104 technologically advanced city in the world.
###108 The curious antics of South Korea's Northern neighbor has
###112 demanded much of the world's attention
###114 over the last 40 years.
###116 But during that time, South Korea has quietly been getting
###120 on with becoming the center of Asian pop culture.
###124 To the point where K-pop is poised to explode over the
###127 face of the world in a blitz of highly choreographed
###131 titillation.
###133 The look here it is all about flawless perfection, whilst
###137 the subtext seems to be x-rated filth.
###140 And I was here to find out just how far people were
###143 willing or expected to go in pursuit of perfection.
###147 
###156 Fashion week is being held at the 1988 Olympic Village,
###159 across town from the now well-known
###162 Gangnam area of Seoul.
###164 This gave me a chance to try and navigate my way there
###167 through the super-techie metro system.
###169 
###172 You're just bombarded with advertising
###174 and interactive stuff.
###178 So while you're waiting for the train, you can engage with
###182 this thing--
###184 a virtual fitting room.
###187 Everyone would agree that I'm already unique and casual, so
###189 I'm going to try chic and modern.
###192 I'm going to choose this sexy office lady here.
###196 And then I take the picture.
###198 Wow.
###200 It was just like the scene in "Clueless." The end result is
###204 a bit disappointing, I'm going to be honest.
###206 
###210 The train is coming.
###212 
###224 At some of the other places we visited on this show, the
###228 actual fashion seemed to be an afterthought
###229 to the event itself.
###232 Here, the fashion was everything and was to be taken
###235 very seriously--
###237 on the catwalk, and in the queue.
###240 Outside the fashion week, I felt positively underdressed.
###244 In this series, I'd not yet been to a place where the kids
###247 took their outfits so seriously.
###249 Or indeed, seen so many scrupulously crafted
###252 looks in one place.
###254 How would you describe your own personal style?
###257 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###258 
###266 CHARLET DUBOC: And it didn't end there.
###267 I spotted luminous pixies, hipster [INAUDIBLE], fay time
###272 travelers, and even a punk.
###275 This is my new friend.
###277 You're the first person we've seen in Seoul that has a
###281 vaguely punk look.
###282 Do you dress this way because you listen to punk music, or
###285 do you dress this way because you like punk fashion?
###287 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###290 CHARLET DUBOC: Where I come from, if people dress like
###293 you, it means that they follow a punk rock lifestyle.
###296 And they believe in a kind of
###299 anti-establishment way of life.
###300 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###302 
###307 CHARLET DUBOC: It's been lovely talking to you.
###309 You're the most polite punk I've every met.
###311 You're a gentleman.
###313 The array of well-honed looks may give the impression of
###317 alternative lifestyles.
###318 But the punk himself admitted that his look
###321 was only skin deep.
###322 
###327 To find out more, I went to see a guy called Donald King,
###331 aka, "the loneliest rockabilly punk in the world." I found
###336 him at his secret barber shop, hidden in the
###338 back streets of Seoul.
###341 He looks like a terrifying butcher--
###344 "Sweeney Todd."
###345 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###346 
###352 DONALD KING: Thank you.
###356 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###357 
###379 CHARLET DUBOC: OK.
###381 
###387 Would you say it's difficult to be a punk and maintain a
###390 punk scene?
###391 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###392 
###422 CHARLET DUBOC: What do you think of the mainstream Korean
###425 fashion industry in general?
###427 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###429 
###433 CHARLET DUBOC: K-pop, that's what Korea's best known for
###436 culturally at the moment.
###438 How does that make you feel?
###439 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###440 
###507 CHARLET DUBOC: I left Don, the lonely punk, with his heart
###510 hurting from the sound of unstoppable K-pop.
###514 Hanryu, or Korean wave, refers to all South Korean popular
###520 entertainment.
###522 The term was coined by Chinese journalists taking note of the
###525 fast-growing popularity of Korean pop culture in China.
###529 Thanks mainly to the internet, which South
###532 Korea pretty much rules.
###533 
###537 K-pop accounts for around 3.8 billion dollars worth of the
###542 country's economy.
###543 So whilst the girls and boys might look like they're at it
###546 like rabbits, they're very much investments to be
###549 protected from the wrong kind of attention.
###553 We went to meet Ha Sang Beg, celebrity designer and boy
###558 band stylist.
###559 He's somewhat of a controversial figure on the
###562 Korean fashion scene, which he seems to revel in.
###566 You need only go to his website to see why.
###568 
###572 Ha Sang has dabbled in many fashion taboos.
###575 HA SANG BEG: I'm inspired by the fetish, tie-up bondage.
###579 The helmet thing is breath control inspired.
###583 CHARLET DUBOC: But it was after his attempt to bring
###585 some androgyny into the world of K-pop that shit
###588 really hit the fan.
###589 
###593 HA SANG BEG: This is SHINee's new album called "Sherlock."
###598 This is sort of ethnic multicultural.
###601 CHARLET DUBOC: Yeah, it's not what I would
###603 associate with K-pop.
###604 It's obviously like an evolution.
###607 HA SANG BEG: OK, thank you.
###608 Is it--
###609 CHARLET DUBOC: It's cool, yeah.
###610 HA SANG BEG: Good?
###610 CHARLET DUBOC: It's classy.
###611 HA SANG BEG: I'm glad.
###613 This a member called [INAUDIBLE].
###615 A lot of fans, in their minds he's still like
###620 a good little boy.
###621 CHARLET DUBOC: And this is quite sexual.
###623 HA SANG BEG: Yeah.
###623 After this, the fan from Turkey said I really
###628 want to kill you.
###629 CHARLET DUBOC: You've ruined his innocence.
###631 HA SANG BEG: How dare you do this?
###633 Nasty, nasty.
###635 It was so shocking to me.
###637 It was a very radical reaction.
###639 CHARLET DUBOC: Do the fans email you personally?
###641 HA SANG BEG: Yes.
###642 Oh, please, make them wear the suit.
###645 One of those stage acts was a very back revealing racerback.
###652 And then, what?
###654 CHARLET DUBOC: They thought it was rude?
###657 HA SANG BEG: I don't know.
###658 The girls having fantasy, I guess.
###661 CHARLET DUBOC: How do they know that it's not the boys
###664 who have the control?
###665 I mean, how much control do the boys have?
###668 
###674 I was keen to find out just how sheltered these boys were.
###678 So we took up the chance to partake in a press junket for
###681 an upcoming boy band.
###683 We've come up to the North of Seoul, because we've been
###686 given this rare opportunity to snatch five minutes with one
###689 of the hottest K-pop bands in Korea at the moment.
###692 They're called Infinite, they're a seven-piece.
###695 They're all babes about half my age.
###697 And hopefully they can explain some of their K-pop
###700 phenomenon.
###701 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###702 
###714 CHARLET DUBOC: I've never done one of these, and was
###716 immediately intimidated by the strange interview format.
###720 I felt like I was about to interview a school photo.
###723 So I'm basically an alien here.
###726 What is K-pop?
###727 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###729 
###742 CHARLET DUBOC: Do any of you have lucky girlfriends?
###746 CHARLET DUBOC: Are you looking for girlfriends?
###748 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###750 CHARLET DUBOC: How would your ideal girlfriend dress?
###752 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###753 
###758 CHARLET DUBOC: Not too sexy, not too much flesh?
###760 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###762 
###764 CHARLET DUBOC: Who gets the most girls?
###766 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###767 
###775 CHARLET DUBOC: What was that?
###779 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###780 
###785 CHARLET DUBOC: Suddenly, one of their team silently stepped
###788 in and ended the interview and we were politely ushered out.
###792 
###796 As K-pop makes a grab for the world, will it
###799 like what it finds?
###801 The West loves success, but also failure and scandal in
###805 equal measure.
###806 And it's hard to tell whether these perfect boys and girls
###810 have what it takes underneath to survive the scrutiny.
###812 
###822 It seemed curious that even the very mention of girls was
###826 enough to end the interview with Infinite.
###828 
###835 Sex in Seoul is a tricky subject.
###839 Basically, until now, if you're young you either find a
###842 dark alley or check yourselves into a sex motel.
###846 Don't even think about taking your boyfriend home unless you
###850 want to watch your father tearfully impale
###852 himself on a chopstick.
###855 Here's where fashion comes to the rescue again.
###858 Slowly, social sexual
###860 conventions are being softened.
###863 How?
###864 Through a rising trend for couples to
###866 wear matching underwear.
###869 Matching couples has been big on the scene for some time,
###872 but now these couples want to match all the way down.
###878 This shop sells matching guy and girl underwear.
###882 Spirit of adventure.
###884 It's really weird.
###887 I mean, if my boyfriend and I wore matching underwear in
###891 England, we'd be a laughingstock.
###892 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###894 
###904 CHARLET DUBOC: Why do you think it became a trend?
###906 What do people like about it?
###908 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###909 
###921 CHARLET DUBOC: We decided to test this new trend by
###924 grabbing a couple for a spot of market research.
###928 So I've cornered this poor, really cute couple.
###932 Where were you heading before we so rudely accosted you?
###935 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###937 
###942 CHARLET DUBOC: What is that, exactly?
###944 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###945 
###952 CHARLET DUBOC: Cool.
###954 So what we're going to do is like a kind of silly game.
###957 I'm going to get you each to pick your favorite thing that
###961 you'd like to match with each other and you're not going to
###963 show each other.
###964 And then we're going to see if you pick the same thing.
###965 Have a look.
###968 How long have you guys been together?
###969 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###971 CHARLET DUBOC: So do you think it's nearly time to get some
###975 matching underwear?
###976 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###977 
###984 CHARLET DUBOC: What's his
###985 personality like, your boyfriend?
###986 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###988 
###1015 CHARLET DUBOC: Make sure he's not looking.
###1018 Now, on three--
###1019 one, two, three.
###1021 
###1023 I can't believe you picked the same things.
###1026 You're going to think we set this up, but
###1028 I promise we didn't.
###1029 Are you surprised?
###1030 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###1033 CHARLET DUBOC: Walking down the street together knowing
###1035 that you both have this matching set on, how would
###1038 that make you feel?
###1039 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###1040 
###1049 CHARLET DUBOC: That's so charming, I'm going to cry.
###1053 I think you'd better get married, guys.
###1055 That's pretty much as good as it gets, let's face it.
###1058 
###1067 Off into the sunset to bang like rabbits.
###1072 Just call me cupid.
###1074 
###1089 Hi!
###1089 Are you a band?
###1091 FEMALE SPEAKER: No.
###1093 FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you.
###1093 FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you.
###1096 CHARLET DUBOC: What was that?
###1098 That was a mega communication fail, but they thought it was
###1101 hysterical.
###1103 Back at fashion week, and I was cutting somewhat of a
###1106 lonely figure.
###1108 Maybe the cool kids were put-off by the fact that I
###1111 only wore one jacket, that on reflection looks slightly too
###1114 homeless for their tastes.
###1116 
###1120 That was until a rather demure girl next to me started to
###1123 speak to me.
###1125 She was a fashion student, but one with a very different
###1128 background to most of the other kids here.
###1131 It turns out she was born in North Korea and smuggled into
###1135 the South as a child.
###1136 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###1137 
###1151 CHARLET DUBOC: But because you came here so young, do you
###1154 feel South Korean or North Korean, or a mixture?
###1158 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###1159 
###1195 CHARLET DUBOC: Do you ever think about how things might
###1197 be different if your family hadn't moved?
###1199 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###1201 
###1229 CHARLET DUBOC: So here in South Korea, girls really can
###1233 do whatever they want to look a certain way.
###1236 And there's a big trend at the moment for people having
###1240 facial surgery.
###1241 What do you think about the trend for plastic surgery?
###1244 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###1245 
###1289 CHARLET DUBOC: A lot of the girls here are having plastic
###1292 surgery to change the way they look.
###1295 How do you feel about that?
###1296 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###1297 
###1305 CHARLET DUBOC: Double eyelid surgery is the practice of
###1307 creating a crease in the eyelid, that many South Korean
###1311 women don't naturally have, to make the
###1313 eyes rounder and wider.
###1315 Having it done here is as commonplace as
###1317 going to the dentist.
###1318 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###1320 
###1342 CHARLET DUBOC: Have you been able to have anything done?
###1345 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###1346 
###1363 CHARLET DUBOC: If the fashion scene was making moves away
###1365 from this trend, I wanted to see what the new generation of
###1368 teenyboppers thought about it.
###1370 
###1374 FEMALE SPEAKER: One, two, three, four,
###1376 five, six, seven, eight.
###1378 One, two, three, four, five.
###1379 
###1389 CHARLET DUBOC: They're a very well-behaved hip-hop band.
###1392 Do you have very distinctive personalities?
###1394 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###1396 
###1400 CHARLET DUBOC: How do you feel about being given that label?
###1403 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###1405 
###1413 CHARLET DUBOC: So it's more about empowering women than
###1415 attracting men?
###1416 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###1418 
###1422 CHARLET DUBOC: How would you girls define Korean beauty?
###1427 What are the beauty ideals that Korean girls aspire to?
###1430 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###1432 
###1446 CHARLET DUBOC: And what do you girls think about that?
###1448 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###1450 
###1460 CHARLET DUBOC: I hadn't expected to hear such concrete
###1462 confirmation that the ideal look is that of Westerners.
###1466 Or at the very least, a stereotypical vision of a
###1469 Western face.
###1470 
###1474 South Korea has overtaken Brazil as the plastic surgery
###1478 capital of the world, with the highest number of surgeries
###1482 performed per capita.
###1485 About one in five women have undergone some sort of
###1488 cosmetic procedure, which have become popular graduation
###1491 gifts for young South Korean girls from their parents.
###1494 
###1499 There was only one last place to go in
###1502 pursuit of this story.
###1503 
###1507 So as we know, plastic surgery is insanely
###1510 popular in South Korea.
###1511 So we've come to a district of Seoul where there are
###1515 literally hundreds of clinics.
###1517 We've been invited by these two lovely doctors to come and
###1520 witness some procedures today that sort of come under this
###1524 blanket term "Westernization."
###1532 It's really chill.
###1533 It's very clean.
###1535 Quite sort of holistic, almost.
###1536 And the two main surgeons, they kind of remind you of
###1540 "Nip/Tuck" guys, they're like cool cats.
###1543 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###1544 
###1581 CHARLET DUBOC: So doctor--
###1583 DR. SEO: Yes?
###1583 CHARLET DUBOC: What's wrong with me?
###1585 DR. SEO: Your problem?
###1586 CHARLET DUBOC: Yeah.
###1587 DR. SEO: Oh, there is no problem.
###1590 You are very beautiful.
###1591 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###1592 
###1621 HUANG SA: My name is Huang Sa, I like the foreigners'
###1627 characteristics, such like yours.
###1629 CHARLET DUBOC: Like me?
###1630 HUANG SA: Yeah.
###1631 It is very, very beautiful.
###1634 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###1635 
###1644 CHARLET DUBOC: And are you happy with the results?
###1647 HUANG SA: Really, really happy and exciting.
###1648 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###1650 
###1665 CHARLET DUBOC: What about your parents or your grandparents?
###1669 Do they feel the same?
###1670 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###1672 
###1691 CHARLET DUBOC: How much of it is important for you
###1694 personally to feel beautiful, and how much of it is
###1698 important to how the rest of Chinese society sees you and
###1702 treats you?
###1703 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###1705 
###1710 CHARLET DUBOC: You look beautiful, I think.
###1712 Because it's different.
###1714 HUANG SA: Oh, different?
###1715 CHARLET DUBOC: You don't look like me or my friends, so
###1718 that's exciting for me.
###1719 You know?
###1720 HUANG SA: Yeah, I know.
###1721 CHARLET DUBOC: So you should be very happy.
###1723 HUANG SA: Thank you.
###1724 CHARLET DUBOC: She was like, what?
###1727 I look different from you.
###1728 Because the whole idea is that she wants my sort of look.
###1732 And I didn't realize at the time until someone told me
###1735 afterwards that me saying that to her actually really
###1738 disappointed her.
###1740 I just feel a bit bad.
###1741 I feel like I need to go and tell her, yeah, yeah, you look
###1743 exactly like me.
###1744 But that's not how I feel, because I
###1748 like her unique look.
###1749 But that's just interesting that
###1751 that's how it came across.
###1752 
###1756 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###1758 
###1763 CHARLET DUBOC: One of the girls at the fashion week said
###1766 that having surgery done was no different to choosing what
###1772 dress to wear that day, or what makeup to wear that day.
###1776 But makeup and a change of clothes aren't quite as
###1779 invasive as this.
###1781 If this work is so prolific in Korea, do you think that it
###1787 could possibly say something about the state of Korean
###1791 society or the psyche of the women here?
###1794 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###1796 
###1812 CHARLET DUBOC: Even though it's not real, they still
###1817 believe they can create fortune by having surgery?
###1821 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###1823 
###1854 [CRYING]
###1860 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###1862 
###1872 CHARLET DUBOC: Is there a right age, psychologically,
###1876 that a girl should be to be ready to make a
###1878 decision like that?
###1879 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###1881 
###1899 CHARLET DUBOC: Do women ever come asking you for surgery
###1902 for the wrong reasons?
###1903 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###1905 
###1977 CHARLET DUBOC: I still think it's a little bit more extreme
###1980 than just your choice of lipstick or how
###1983 much mascara you wear.
###1984 Because, I mean, well, you can see for yourself.
###1988 
###1995 Fashion week has distanced himself from K-pop culture,
###1999 staying very much in the international
###2001 high fashion vein.
###2004 During our time backstage, we've met many people who
###2007 wanted to reverse the trend of enhanced perfection, and the
###2010 seeds of dissent are starting to grow.
###2014 Those who champion natural beauty have presented an
###2017 argument that is hard to ignore.
###2019 Think about it.
###2021 A girl changes her face and meets the boy of her dreams.
###2025 Maybe he's had some work done, too.
###2027 They fall in love, get married, succeed at work, and
###2032 then settle down to have a family.
###2034 But on the day their first child is born, the secrets of
###2038 their past come flooding back.
###2039
