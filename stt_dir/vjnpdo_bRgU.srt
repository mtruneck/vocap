BRAZIER: Better nutrition is basically what
the core [INDISTINCT] talks about, whether


3
0:0:28,279 --> 0:0:35,309
it's last night's performance or other types
of performance. So it's kind of just a full


4
0:0:35,309 --> 0:0:46,54
gamut of what performance is. I'll be talking
about how to prove that through what we eat.


5
0:0:46,54 --> 0:0:55,43
I'll give you a little background first. I
started off in 1990. I started running track


6
0:0:55,43 --> 0:1:4,15
in high school and I just really enjoyed it.
I just loved running, so I thought, "Well,


7
0:1:4,15 --> 0:1:8,68
if I have to do this full-time as a career,
as a job, that would be ideal." So that's


8
0:1:8,68 --> 0:1:16,81
when I started working towards just trying
to be a full-time professional runner just


9
0:1:16,81 --> 0:1:24,32
because enjoyed it. I'm just really--like
it or not by nature a competitive person,


10
0:1:24,32 --> 0:1:34,68
you know, I just--just something I like to
do. So, unfortunately, soon after, I got injured.


11
0:1:34,68 --> 0:1:49,13
I ran too much, did it too much too soon and
I got stressed up. So, I started swimming,


12
0:1:49,13 --> 0:1:56,93
cycling trying to maintain my fitness while
I was injured and I realized I really like


13
0:1:56,93 --> 0:2:4,7
swimming and cycling as well. So I kind of
figured swimming, cycling, running, that's


14
0:2:4,7 --> 0:2:13,49
triathlon. Maybe I can do triathlon full-time
and have that as my career and have that as


15
0:2:13,49 --> 0:2:22,379
my job and now this could be ideal, this could
be perfect. And I might say, by nature, I'm


16
0:2:22,379 --> 0:2:33,879
not really a competitive person, so I wasn't
doing this to try to prove anything to myself


17
0:2:33,879 --> 0:2:48,659
or anyone, I just like doing it. So, I'm not
really a motivational type of speaker, so


18
0:2:48,659 --> 0:2:55,329
thought about overcoming odds and, like, breaking
through barriers and trying to push myself


19
0:2:55,329 --> 0:3:2,419
to experience times like this, so I hope I
don't disappoint anyone. But soon after, I


20
0:3:2,419 --> 0:3:13,709
decided to do Ironman Triathlon. Ironman Triathlon
is made up of a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike


21
0:3:13,709 --> 0:3:25,779
ride and a marathon, so 26.2 miles. So, obviously,
a really long event but if you want to do


22
0:3:25,779 --> 0:3:37,819
well, you have to train a lot. But like I
said, I enjoyed the training so that was--that


23
0:3:37,819 --> 0:3:51,29
was the easy part for me just--because I like
it. But what surprised me is when I started


24
0:3:51,29 --> 0:4:6,4
looking into this seriously and I found that
some of the top athletes in the world were


25
0:4:6,4 --> 0:4:13,329
doing the identical training to the average
athletes. Their training programs differed


26
0:4:13,329 --> 0:4:21,359
very little. And, of course, I asked myself,
"Well, if some of these guys are top in the


27
0:4:21,359 --> 0:4:28,65
world and now they are just average, what
is it that separates that?" Obviously, it's


28
0:4:28,65 --> 0:4:36,7
not the training, so there's another factor
there that is allowing some to become world-class


29
0:4:36,7 --> 0:4:41,44
while others remain average in [INDISTINCT].
So, I started to investigate that and I found


30
0:4:41,44 --> 0:4:44,96
it had more to do with what happened between
the training as opposed to the actual training


31
0:4:44,96 --> 0:4:49,169
itself. So, the recovery phase, the phase
that your body generates and renews itself


32
0:4:49,169 --> 0:4:54,65
after exercise is what we realized is the
most important phase. And, of course, when


33
0:4:54,65 --> 0:5:1,21
we rest, we eat well, our body overcompensates
and becomes stronger, that's why training


34
0:5:1,21 --> 0:5:10,11
works, is that overcompensation by our body
that I think only happened during the recovery


35
0:5:10,11 --> 0:5:22,229
phase and when our cell regenerate and renew
themselves. So, that's where I began to focus,


36
0:5:22,229 --> 0:5:38,199
is on that renewal process. And I realized
that around 80% of recovery could be attributed


37
0:5:38,199 --> 0:5:43,27
to nutrition, so, obviously, an overwhelming
amount. So that's what I started focusing


38
0:5:43,27 --> 0:5:49,33
on, was nutrition. And that's why I value
and trust the nutrition [INDISTINCT] age.


39
0:5:49,33 --> 0:5:59,449
And I didn't care about nutrition just so
I could say nutrition. I cared about it because


40
0:5:59,449 --> 0:6:7,629
I knew it would stab the [INDISTINCT] as an
athlete. And I've never really being entrusted


41
0:6:7,629 --> 0:6:16,47
with nutrition so much, but I'm entrusting
the outcome of a good nutrition; the mental


42
0:6:16,47 --> 0:6:28,2
clarity, the ability to get away with less
sleep, the ability to be more productive which,


43
0:6:28,2 --> 0:6:31,3
you know, I need to tell you people about,
so things like that that are very tightly


44
0:6:31,3 --> 0:6:39,75
tied to good nutrition, what it can do for
you. So I became quite interested in this.


45
0:6:39,75 --> 0:6:44,99
And I started trying different ways of eating
just to see if I could boost my performance


46
0:6:44,99 --> 0:6:51,61
with these--these different types of diets.
I tried the whole gamut; I tried the high


47
0:6:51,61 --> 0:6:59,949
carb, low carb, high protein, low protein
and nothing really impressed me. And some


48
0:6:59,949 --> 0:7:11,789
were better than others, but nothing was really
amazing and I found that I wasn't really getting


49
0:7:11,789 --> 0:7:19,2
the results I wanted. So, I kept on trying
different ones and I tried to completely file


50
0:7:19,2 --> 0:7:29,229
these diets to a vegan--completely vegan diet
and it didn't work. At first, I was always


51
0:7:29,229 --> 0:7:38,65
hungry, I was tired and I wasn't recovering
well and my high school track coach asked


52
0:7:38,65 --> 0:7:47,189
me what I was doing wrong and I'm almost trying
this--this new diet, this new way of eating.


53
0:7:47,189 --> 0:7:59,69
And he was a very good coach but because he
was so good, he was somewhat closed-minded.


54
0:7:59,69 --> 0:8:13,779
He had had a lot of success, he had the template
that worked, he put all of his athletes through


55
0:8:13,779 --> 0:8:18,449
it, they got results, so he wasn't willing
to change and he had zero interest in this


56
0:8:18,449 --> 0:8:27,5
new way of eating. And that discouraged me
at the time, but when I look back on that,


57
0:8:27,5 --> 0:8:36,55
I think that was actually a good thing because
it's helped me realize that if this top level


58
0:8:36,55 --> 0:8:50,2
coach doesn't place any value to good nutrition,
then probably a lot of other top level coaches


59
0:8:50,2 --> 0:8:59,66
doesn't either. So I thought, "Okay. Well,
if I can find a recovery program that works


60
0:8:59,66 --> 0:9:9,91
well for myself maybe that's the sort of thing
that then can be passed onto athletes through--through


61
0:9:9,91 --> 0:9:19,4
coaches. And he, like I say, was resistant
to this but I kept on pursuing it and looking


62
0:9:19,4 --> 0:9:25,44
into ways to boost performance through better
nutrition. I tried a whole bunch of different


63
0:9:25,44 --> 0:9:33,15
ways of eating. Like I say, there's different
high carb, low protein also [INDISTINCT].


64
0:9:33,15 --> 0:9:49,3
And then the [INDISTINCT] I start investigating
further. I thought, "I think there's something


65
0:9:49,3 --> 0:9:55,9
to this. I was eating wrong" and I was eating
wrong. I was basically eating a junk food


66
0:9:55,9 --> 0:10:4,28
vegan diet and that's very easy to do. And
keep in mind too when I--when I'm telling


67
0:10:4,28 --> 0:10:7,99
this story this was happening in 1990, so
information didn't flow the way that it does


68
0:10:7,99 --> 0:10:15,38
today. So information about all this nutrition
was very hard to come by, information about


69
0:10:15,38 --> 0:10:23,15
sports-specific kind of based nutrition is
near impossible. So I had to do a lot of research


70
0:10:23,15 --> 0:10:28,65
and really find out what's--what would help
me and I have--I--I revealed five major things


71
0:10:28,65 --> 0:10:37,83
initially that I was lacking in my diet, to
this eating junk food diet, and it was complete


72
0:10:37,83 --> 0:10:45,42
protein, vitamin B12, iron, calcium and omega
3 fatty acids. So, pretty major stuff that


73
0:10:45,42 --> 0:10:53,8
I simply didn't have in my nutrition program.
So as I investigated, I did some research


74
0:10:53,8 --> 0:10:59,52
more, I found what each of these nutrients
came from, which plants. And then I found


75
0:10:59,52 --> 0:11:3,26
those plants, started planting them together
kind of [INDISTINCT] working and it really


76
0:11:3,26 --> 0:11:13,98
did work. It did allow me to speed recovery.
It didn't taste very good but it's functional.


77
0:11:13,98 --> 0:11:22,14
It got me what I wanted it. It got me to the
point where I could--did considerably more


78
0:11:22,14 --> 0:11:29,2
training than people I trained with and that
was a huge advantage because that enforced-obviously,


79
0:11:29,2 --> 0:11:36,33
my performance improved at a quicker rate
and I got closer to achieving my goal of having


80
0:11:36,33 --> 0:11:48,52
that triathlon. So I was pleased with that.
In 1990, I started all this, in '98 I started


81
0:11:48,52 --> 0:11:57,86
my professional career as an athlete, as an
Ironman triathelete. So I did that seven years


82
0:11:57,86 --> 0:12:4,53
full-time and it was great. I really enjoyed
that, that seven-year career. It went--it


83
0:12:4,53 --> 0:12:13,52
went well. But in 2004, I slipped [INDISTINCT]
in cycling and I couldn't raise my gear, and


84
0:12:13,52 --> 0:12:23,36
obviously not a good thing to have happened
but for the first time I thought, "I have


85
0:12:23,36 --> 0:12:30,11
trained all this time. I have always been
training, racing and [INDISTINCT] for anything."


86
0:12:30,11 --> 0:12:37,64
So, this is kind of exciting to me and I've
been getting asked the same question over


87
0:12:37,64 --> 0:12:47,13
and over. These people knew that I raced at
a high level, they knew I had [INDISTINCT],


88
0:12:47,13 --> 0:12:54,49
so I always getting asked where do I get my
calcium, my iron, protein, all these things.


89
0:12:54,49 --> 0:13:3,5
So, I decided to address those and write about
them in a short book that I published that's


90
0:13:3,5 --> 0:13:13,24
called Thrive. Self-published book, 500 pages
long and it came up in 2004. Then I expanded


91
0:13:13,24 --> 0:13:26,39
it, added a bunch of new ideas, expanded on
the ideas that existed and added 500 recipes


92
0:13:26,39 --> 0:13:34,67
and that became called the Thrive Diet. It
was published by Penguin in Canada and then


93
0:13:34,67 --> 0:13:41,12
published the following year here [INDISTINCT]
diet. Apparently, the word "diet" sounds [INDISTINCT]


94
0:13:41,12 --> 0:13:56,52
here, so I don't know. So it's just--if you
see a book called Thrive Diet, it is the same


95
0:13:56,52 --> 0:14:2,99
book [INDISTINCT]; different publisher, different
cover, different title, same book. And anyway,


96
0:14:2,99 --> 0:14:10,96
so what I wanted to do today is kind of go
over some of the main ideas in--in those books


97
0:14:10,96 --> 0:14:16,18
that you can use to apply to life whether
you're athletic or not. They are very broad,


98
0:14:16,18 --> 0:14:26,28
so they will help you perform better, like
I said, when you're an athlete or you just


99
0:14:26,28 --> 0:14:33,21
want to maximize you ability to think clearly,
you can sleep amount by quality, [INDISTINCT],


100
0:14:33,21 --> 0:14:41,54
all those things. As I was mentioning, in
2004, I have partnered with someone else and


101
0:14:41,54 --> 0:14:50,8
we collaborated and made a replica the [INDISTINCT]
myself for years and it's now available in


102
0:14:50,8 --> 0:14:55,27
all pretty much all healthy stores, it's called
[INDISTINCT] appetizer. If you love samples,


103
0:14:55,27 --> 0:15:4,91
[INDISTINCT] and if you want to talk a little
bit on that as I finish speaking here you're


104
0:15:4,91 --> 0:15:20,84
very welcome to. We made some of that [INDISTINCT].
So it was pronounced six years in Canada,


105
0:15:20,84 --> 0:15:28,13
five years here. Anyway, the first thing I
want to talk about pertaining to the book


106
0:15:28,13 --> 0:15:36,2
is something called gaining energy through
conservation as opposed to consumption. What


107
0:15:36,2 --> 0:15:46,23
do I mean by that? It's eating food, you use
less energy, it's digested similarly but give


108
0:15:46,23 --> 0:15:56,71
you more new things in return. Now, I made
a mistake for years and I think a lot of people


109
0:15:56,71 --> 0:16:2,38
make this mistake, it's very common, to assume
that since calories [INDISTINCT] food energy,


110
0:16:2,38 --> 0:16:11,93
you would think that the more calories you
ate the more energy you would have. It seems


111
0:16:11,93 --> 0:16:25,89
to make sense, but if that worked really true,
people eat lots of fast food, lots of high


112
0:16:25,89 --> 0:16:31,42
calorie foods without [INDISTINCT]. So the
problem is, is that you have to spend energy


113
0:16:31,42 --> 0:16:38,53
to digest when eating highly processed foods
and when you spend something you no longer


114
0:16:38,53 --> 0:16:44,89
have it, just like anything. It's like money,
if you spend it, it's gone, you don't have


115
0:16:44,89 --> 0:16:48,56
it. However, you can make a good investment
and get a return on that investment. So that's


116
0:16:48,56 --> 0:16:54,62
something that you have to think about food,
is something that I would get a return on


117
0:16:54,62 --> 0:17:6,35
if I made the right choice. So, for example,
I went from eating tons of grand peanut butter,


118
0:17:6,35 --> 0:17:19,79
not that that's the worst thing in the world
to eat but it is very highly processed, it


119
0:17:19,79 --> 0:17:33,14
is [INDISTINCT] bread and processed peanut
butter. So we spend a lot of energy to digest--disseminate


120
0:17:33,14 --> 0:17:44,13
that food so you have lots of it. Pretty simple
not like--plus, it has very few nutrients


121
0:17:44,13 --> 0:17:54,0
in it and when I say nutrients that's speaking
of micronutrients. You know, we don't lack


122
0:17:54,0 --> 0:18:6,95
calories. Calories are very, very easy to
get. It's the micronutrients that a lot of


123
0:18:6,95 --> 0:18:17,72
us lack and micronutrients are vitamins, minerals,
phytochemicals, anti-oxidants, all those things


124
0:18:17,72 --> 0:18:22,91
are the base to good health that by eating
these way, I was getting the calories but


125
0:18:22,91 --> 0:18:28,42
I wasn't getting the micronutrinets. So I
switched over and started squatting out right


126
0:18:28,42 --> 0:18:32,19
a bread and even regular bread and pasta and
all types of flours, all types of refined


127
0:18:32,19 --> 0:18:37,77
starchy foods. [INDISTINCT] started eating,
most likely, carbohydrate and fruit. Fruit


128
0:18:37,77 --> 0:18:43,7
is a great source of carbohydrate, it digest
much more easily than these refined carbs


129
0:18:43,7 --> 0:18:48,27
plus there's more micronutrients. So, less
energy out, more micronutrients in, I call


130
0:18:48,27 --> 0:18:55,41
that high net-gain food. So that's the first
part that I [INDISTINCT] on my focus on the


131
0:18:55,41 --> 0:19:3,25
basic diet on high net-gain foods. Now, in
other high net-gain food, in addition to this


132
0:19:3,25 --> 0:19:11,32
fruit, there's something called [INDISTINCT]
amaranth, [INDISTINCT] wild rice, these are


133
0:19:11,32 --> 0:19:20,87
typically seeds, they're not grains. So they're
anti-coagulant, they digest more easily because


134
0:19:20,87 --> 0:19:27,7
they are seeds, they have more protein, they're
around 25% protein supposed to, with grain


135
0:19:27,7 --> 0:19:29,22
it will be much low. So, just making that
little change with my diet, I found--I had


136
0:19:29,22 --> 0:19:34,32
significantly more energy, yet my calories
dropped, 20% to 30% but more energy. It is


137
0:19:34,32 --> 0:19:39,24
like, so, is it spending so much to get it?
Plus, I started getting more micronutrients


138
0:19:39,24 --> 0:19:46,9
in. Now when you get the micronutrients in,
that's going to help turn off your hunger


139
0:19:46,9 --> 0:20:1,49
signal. Now, our hunger signal of course,
is a cardinal signal that goes back to our


140
0:20:1,49 --> 0:20:15,47
previous ancestor that tells us we need food
and we need food for fuel and building blocks.


141
0:20:15,47 --> 0:20:26,53
So, as soon as we get hungry, that's a sign,
a biological sign, it speaks in from our brain


142
0:20:26,53 --> 0:20:34,77
and tells to eat. Now, the problem is, most
of Americans, a lot of food they eat lacks


143
0:20:34,77 --> 0:20:40,75
micronutrients. So, our hunger signal remains
active, you see, white bread as an example.


144
0:20:40,75 --> 0:20:46,74
White bread, pretty much no micronutrients
but you could eat it, it would physically


145
0:20:46,74 --> 0:20:51,72
fill up your stomach but you're still going
to be hungry, you're still going to want eat--keep


146
0:20:51,72 --> 0:20:57,52
eating because that chemical hunt--hunger
signal remains active. Now that's the number


147
0:20:57,52 --> 0:21:4,77
reason for obesity in North America. It's
very simple, we'd over consume. But the reason


148
0:21:4,77 --> 0:21:12,23
we over consume is because there's so few
micronutrients in the food we have these days


149
0:21:12,23 --> 0:21:21,2
that we keep on eating and until we get the
micronutrients to satisfy our hunger signal


150
0:21:21,2 --> 0:21:30,29
and turn it on. And of course that, that's
a lot of food, and then that's a lot of calories,


151
0:21:30,29 --> 0:21:37,82
that's why people gain weight. And of course
we gain weight, your risk factor for a whole


152
0:21:37,82 --> 0:21:38,71
bunch of diseases goes up. So, type 2 diabetes,
arthritis, osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases,


153
0:21:38,71 --> 0:21:44,14
all these things. So, if we [INDISTINCT] foods
plus all of--some specifics that have been


154
0:21:44,14 --> 0:21:51,88
here, we're going to get full much more easily.
We just don't want you to eat it. So, very


155
0:21:51,88 --> 0:22:1,25
clearly, I'm not an advocate of portion control,
I think if you're hungry, you should eat.


156
0:22:1,25 --> 0:22:10,46
Food is not the enemy. Food is good. Food
is a good thing for you. Why do we get ourselves


157
0:22:10,46 --> 0:22:21,23
in trouble? It's because we eat--at times
Americans, a lot of highly refined foods that


158
0:22:21,23 --> 0:22:30,8
do not turn off our hunger signal and just
creates a wealth of calories that basically


159
0:22:30,8 --> 0:22:37,309
you're not healing. And it's actually very
common, you have to be overfed, you have to


160
0:22:37,309 --> 0:22:46,26
be nourished. I mean, I would have been a
paradox, you know, 15, 20 years ago but I


161
0:22:46,26 --> 0:22:52,26
was pretty much the norm and people who are
obese are calling me, showing symptoms of


162
0:22:52,26 --> 0:23:2,59
malnutrition. And you'll figure, how can you
mean so much to become obese yet, be malnourished?


163
0:23:2,59 --> 0:23:14,91
Very strange, but that's a testament to other
direction our food system is going with producing,


164
0:23:14,91 --> 0:23:28,72
yes, a lot of calories, a lot of starch, very
low micronutrients. So, like I said, basically,


165
0:23:28,72 --> 0:23:38,38
a diet on these high net-gain foods, a lot
of energy out, lots of micronutrients in and


166
0:23:38,38 --> 0:23:44,52
basically [INDISTINCT] a lot. There's something
else I think is really important, is the relationship


167
0:23:44,52 --> 0:23:52,6
between stress and hormones. Now, there are
[INDISTINCT] a lot of people don't realize


168
0:23:52,6 --> 0:23:59,14
this, I didn't realize this until I experience
the downside of it and this is really a lot


169
0:23:59,14 --> 0:24:0,28
of what my [INDISTINCT] me making states--taking
years to figure them out and then, you know,


170
0:24:0,28 --> 0:24:7,5
remembering the [INDISTINCT] so, hopefully,
you don't have to be in the same states but


171
0:24:7,5 --> 0:24:18,8
stress does not know where it comes from.
It's perceived by your body the same way and


172
0:24:18,8 --> 0:24:26,49
it has the same physiological response which
is causing cortisol to get a lot of cortisol


173
0:24:26,49 --> 0:24:33,1
stress hormones. So, stress can come from
too much work, not enough downtime, you have


174
0:24:33,1 --> 0:24:39,63
initial stress; concerns about family, concerns
about relationship, concerns about professional


175
0:24:39,63 --> 0:24:45,95
problems, walking down the street could be
included there, that's environmental stress


176
0:24:45,95 --> 0:24:56,25
or eating food that takes a lot of energy
to digest because a very few nutrients returned


177
0:24:56,25 --> 0:25:3,7
is nutritional stress. You know, work without
getting something back is--it's biologically


178
0:25:3,7 --> 0:25:10,83
stressful. It's [INDISTINCT] so, all those
things even--it's like, logical stress. It's


179
0:25:10,83 --> 0:25:26,1
like, we're going to go things you have control
of it. Stress, you know, some people are more


180
0:25:26,1 --> 0:25:31,3
[INDISTINCT] than other than [INDISTINCT]
personality types [INDISTINCT] and, you know,


181
0:25:31,3 --> 0:25:40,55
90% of those things they can't control. So,
that's just extra stress that you don't need.


182
0:25:40,55 --> 0:25:48,61
So, when that happens, anyone of those things
triggers a stress response, cortisol will


183
0:25:48,61 --> 0:25:54,99
go up, when cortisol goes up several bad things
happen. One, physiologically you will not


184
0:25:54,99 --> 0:26:5,21
be able to get to deep phase of sleep, on
delta; that's a really deep rejuvenating phase


185
0:26:5,21 --> 0:26:15,21
that as North Americans, most of us never
get into it. And the reason of that of course


186
0:26:15,21 --> 0:26:27,7
is cortisol being high. So, then we don't
sleep deeply, we don't get this deep delta


187
0:26:27,7 --> 0:26:36,21
phase of sleep, so what happens is, of course
we wake up and we're still tired and then


188
0:26:36,21 --> 0:26:44,7
when we do eventually get on that, we'll take
coffee and sugar. Coffee and sugar works.


189
0:26:44,7 --> 0:26:53,54
They give us energy right away and puts through
stimulation and obviously it's treating the


190
0:26:53,54 --> 0:27:0,2
symptom [INDISTINCT] it's altering the cause--the
cause is we didn't sleep well. We didn't sleep


191
0:27:0,2 --> 0:27:9,62
well is because the cortisol's high and the
cortisol's high because of stress. So, it


192
0:27:9,62 --> 0:27:18,15
all comes back to that. So if you do drink
coffee, [INDISTINCT] to overcome this, it


193
0:27:18,15 --> 0:27:23,83
just perpetuates the circle and then we become
dependent on this stimulants and I realize


194
0:27:23,83 --> 0:27:33,11
that we all can be successful in [INDISTINCT]
not to break that cycle and it's hard to do,


195
0:27:33,11 --> 0:27:43,11
you look around and see all the coffee shop
and deli shops, it's very clear. The poor


196
0:27:43,11 --> 0:27:55,53
society that is dependent on these stimulants
but as we lower cortisol and I'll give you


197
0:27:55,53 --> 0:28:5,28
specifics in a minute on how it is but cortisol
starts [INDISTINCT] sleep deeply, you wake


198
0:28:5,28 --> 0:28:12,39
up, you're freshly rested, you're ready to
go, you don't have to take coffee and take


199
0:28:12,39 --> 0:28:15,45
sugar. It [INDISTINCT] now the down side to
this of course, is that it's [INDISTINCT]


200
0:28:15,45 --> 0:28:25,6
it will take a couple of weeks to kick in,
you drink coffee, obviously it's a medium,


201
0:28:25,6 --> 0:28:31,64
this is not a medium. So, you have to be prepared
putting in a little bit of an effort and invest


202
0:28:31,64 --> 0:28:38,45
a little bit enough but of course, once it
happens, then the problem is solved, you don't


203
0:28:38,45 --> 0:28:42,71
have to deal with it anymore. And now there's
a huge advantage to reducing cortisol is that,


204
0:28:42,71 --> 0:28:51,929
when you sleep more deeply, when you get to
that deep delta phase of sleep, you're colony


205
0:28:51,929 --> 0:28:59,429
obviously is getting better. So therefore,
naturally, you're quantity will come down.


206
0:28:59,429 --> 0:29:2,54
So, maybe, you just need eight or nine hours
sleep at night. Now, you can get away with


207
0:29:2,54 --> 0:29:4,23
seven. And that's obviously very beneficial,
I mean, anyone will sure benefit from that


208
0:29:4,23 --> 0:29:8,79
extra hours of sleep at night or an extra
hour of balance sleep a day. So it's kind


209
0:29:8,79 --> 0:29:12,799
of a deal that saying everyday is [INDISTINCT]
so, it's great. It's obviously a very practical


210
0:29:12,799 --> 0:29:15,0
solution to freeing up more [INDISTINCT] by
improving sleep quality and quantity to able


211
0:29:15,0 --> 0:29:16,85
to [INDISTINCT] and I'm sure you've noticed
this, you have pretty much had conversations


212
0:29:16,85 --> 0:29:18,97
with people and you're wondering, are these
people totally paying attention? Are they


213
0:29:18,97 --> 0:29:25,38
fully awake? And the answer is probably no,
they're not. Because when they're sleeping,


214
0:29:25,38 --> 0:29:29,17
they probably weren't fully asleep. So I want
it to become blur between being sleepy and


215
0:29:29,17 --> 0:29:29,44
being awake. We don't sleep fully deeply;
when we're awake, we're not fully awake in


216
0:29:29,44 --> 0:29:31,36
some people, so. I'm honestly defining up
on deep sleep and then complete being awake


217
0:29:31,36 --> 0:29:34,61
and focus concentration and obviously productivity
and stuff like that goes up. So, I'm sure


218
0:29:34,61 --> 0:29:37,83
you don't appreciate that. Less sleep, another
problem with high cortisol level is the inability


219
0:29:37,83 --> 0:29:40,35
to tone muscle and move body fat efficiently.
Now again, I learned this the hard way. I


220
0:29:40,35 --> 0:29:43,82
was training in 1997, 35, 40 hours a week,
I was trying to build up for my first [INDISTINCT]


221
0:29:43,82 --> 0:29:46,36
even, first professional career as a triathlete
for the following year and I was training


222
0:29:46,36 --> 0:29:47,4
35 to 40 hours a week, it was great up until
the fourth week and then I stared, first of


223
0:29:47,4 --> 0:29:52,72
all, I started getting really tired and I
thought, well, this [INDISTINCT] reason I'm


224
0:29:52,72 --> 0:29:54,309
exercising a lot. But the more tired I got,
the worst quality of sleep became. And I realize


225
0:29:54,309 --> 0:29:55,27
now of course, that's because I've--has cortisol
to go high, which should prevent me from sleeping


226
0:29:55,27 --> 0:29:56,73
deeply so I can compensate by adding extra
sleep and it [INDISTINCT] back in front but


227
0:29:56,73 --> 0:30:2,559
I was sleeping nine hours a night and obviously,
you don't have to do that and to make up for


228
0:30:2,559 --> 0:30:3,9
the, you know, the shortcomings of my quality
of sleep but also with the more quantity.


229
0:30:3,9 --> 0:30:6,47
But like, as I got to back on track, I didn't
understand it since I was [INDISTINCT] dressing


230
0:30:6,47 --> 0:30:11,46
properly but now I know of course, if it had
been to better nutrition that it would release


231
0:30:11,46 --> 0:30:11,65
cortisone. What's starting to happen at the
following year is even more strange, I began


232
0:30:11,65 --> 0:30:11,87
gaining weight and it wasn't muscle, it was
fat. I started gaining by pound of fat every


233
0:30:11,87 --> 0:30:12,9
three weeks and I thought, "How is it possible
to gain fat when I'm exercising 35, 40 hours


234
0:30:12,9 --> 0:30:13,9
a week. No idea why. So I started asking around.
I started asking, the so-called professionals,


235
0:30:13,9 --> 0:30:18,94
reading a lot of books and everyone said the
same thing. If you're gaining weight, it's


236
0:30:18,94 --> 0:30:21,37
simple, you're taking more calories than you
burn. And I thought, well, you know, that's


237
0:30:21,37 --> 0:30:31,66
pretty strange because, yes, I was taking
a lot calories but even if I was burning,


238
0:30:31,66 --> 0:30:33,89
I thought, there's no way I would have taking
in these excess fat. This can't be. But I


239
0:30:33,89 --> 0:30:35,39
was out of idea. I had no idea what was going
on. So I tried this suggestion, I cut back


240
0:30:35,39 --> 0:30:42,39
in my food intake. I started gaining weight
more for like--about a pound every two weeks


241
0:30:42,39 --> 0:30:47,83
and I thought, "How is this possible?" If
I'm right in eating, I'm gaining fat and I'm


242
0:30:47,83 --> 0:30:51,69
exercising 35 to 40 hours a week, I don't
get it. And I didn't get it until about a


243
0:30:51,69 --> 0:30:51,91
year and a half later, until I spoke with
men with problems to explain to me the relationship


244
0:30:51,91 --> 0:30:53,61
between stress and hormones. Now, what I've
done is I had over trained. So that's physical


245
0:30:53,61 --> 0:30:55,62
stress, of course exercise is good but in
excess, it's not and I stepped over the line.


246
0:30:55,62 --> 0:30:56,38
So, I had put some physical strain in my body
for me--having to find--recover from all these


247
0:30:56,38 --> 0:30:57,1
exercise that--I've had some cortisol to be
chronically elevated and burned up my adrenals.


248
0:30:57,1 --> 0:30:57,78
So, I wasn't sleeping well, but also if cortisol
goes high, it's near possible to tone muscle


249
0:30:57,78 --> 0:30:58,27
and lose fat. In extreme cases, will be [INDISTINCT],
so that's exactly what was happening to me


250
0:30:58,27 --> 0:31:1,13
as I've gone to that extreme. And I think
a lot of people are in that situation, not


251
0:31:1,13 --> 0:31:1,799
from necessarily over training stress but
just stress; work, family, all of those things


252
0:31:1,799 --> 0:31:2,62
I mentioned before. So, it caused the cortisol
to go up, so that means it's very difficult


253
0:31:2,62 --> 0:31:3,28
to tone muscle and lose fat and breakthrough
those athletic plateaus. So if you've been


254
0:31:3,28 --> 0:31:4,799
working out consistently and you can't seem
to get the results that you think you should,


255
0:31:4,799 --> 0:31:6,15
look into at your life [INDISTINCT], look
at all those other stresses and all those


256
0:31:6,15 --> 0:31:6,69
other things going on as opposed to just calories
in and calories out. The reason I started


257
0:31:6,69 --> 0:31:6,73
gaining weight more quickly when I cut back
on eating the food I was eating was because


258
0:31:6,73 --> 0:31:6,76
I was down to five in my body nutrition. I
wasn't getting the body--my body the fuel


259
0:31:6,76 --> 0:31:6,799
it needed to fuel these workouts or the building
blocks it needed to recover from it. So that


260
0:31:6,799 --> 0:31:6,83
was just the greatest stress, I just placed
more stress in my body which prompts the cortisol


261
0:31:6,83 --> 0:31:6,87
to go up even higher which causes me to lean
back that more quickly. So, on the surface


262
0:31:6,87 --> 0:31:6,9
that seemed counter intuitive, obviously if
you're exercising a lot, you're not eating


263
0:31:6,9 --> 0:31:6,929
much and you're gaining weight, well, the
tendency of course is exercise in the morning


264
0:31:6,929 --> 0:31:6,96
less. That was the opposite if--of what I
should have done. What I should have done


265
0:31:6,96 --> 0:31:7,77
is ate more nutrient that's called high net-gain
foods and alkaline-forming foods, I'll talk


266
0:31:7,77 --> 0:31:8,74
about that in a minute and that's when it
started to bring cortisol back down. So, I


267
0:31:8,74 --> 0:31:10,76
think--like I said, a lot of people are in
that situation and I'm sure you've seen people


268
0:31:10,76 --> 0:31:11,92
like this. You see them at the gym, you go
to the gym regularly. You see the same people


269
0:31:11,92 --> 0:31:13,12
like week after week, maybe month after month,
year after years. It's the same people at


270
0:31:13,12 --> 0:31:15,37
your gym. And they have lose--that have lost
5 to 10 pounds or change their body shape,


271
0:31:15,37 --> 0:31:17,54
whatever. And I'm sure if you were to go to
those people and ask them what was going on,


272
0:31:17,54 --> 0:31:19,45
then I must suggest you [INDISTINCT] right
away if you were to do that. They'd probably


273
0:31:19,45 --> 0:31:19,91
be confused, they probably wouldn't know what
the problem is, but then we started looking


274
0:31:19,91 --> 0:31:20,35
at--holistically as a person and not just
the machine, calories in and calories out


275
0:31:20,35 --> 0:31:20,87
but you started asking about their professional
life, their personal life and you saw all


276
0:31:20,87 --> 0:31:21,35
things that cause worry and concern in your,
there's an answer; worry, concern, stress,


277
0:31:21,35 --> 0:31:22,12
cortisol. So, essentially those people are
and I was hormonally injured and that's the


278
0:31:22,12 --> 0:31:22,48
way the endocrinologist explained me. And
I think that's an excellent way to look at


279
0:31:22,48 --> 0:31:23,0
it because--of course you can't see it, you
know, like it's another type of injury; a


280
0:31:23,0 --> 0:31:23,0
broken arm or something but it's still an
injury. When your hormones are so far in the


281
0:31:23,0 --> 0:31:23,0
[INDISTINCT] that you cannot tone muscle,
you cannot lose fat. So, something to consider,


282
0:31:23,0 --> 0:31:23,0
you know, if you're in that situation, you
exercise diligently and you can't seem to


283
0:31:23,0 --> 0:31:23,0
break through or you can go backwards then
take a look at all the other things in your


284
0:31:23,0 --> 0:31:23,85
life. Now, it's easier said than done in some
cases. Now I understand that obviously there's


285
0:31:23,85 --> 0:31:24,24
a lot of stresses in our life that we can't
control and those things are family related,


286
0:31:24,24 --> 0:31:24,24
work related, some of those things are out
of our control. I will say one thing to that


287
0:31:24,24 --> 0:31:24,24
though, perception also has a large component
to do with the stress. If you could see something


288
0:31:24,24 --> 0:31:25,57
stressful, it's stressful. So, as an example,
I like to run, so for me to go for a run,


289
0:31:25,57 --> 0:31:32,299
I actually get a greater physiological benefit,
but some [INDISTINCT] forcing herself to go


290
0:31:32,299 --> 0:31:33,559
for a run. So if you don't like running, don't
run. It's pretty much that simple. People


291
0:31:33,559 --> 0:31:39,169
say yoga is great for stress relief, yes,
that's true if you like yoga, if you don't,


292
0:31:39,169 --> 0:31:40,7
it's not so good. So, I think when you [INDISTINCT]
your activity too, find something that you


293
0:31:40,7 --> 0:31:41,2
really do enjoy and know that that is actually
going to have a greater benefit to your end--your


294
0:31:41,2 --> 0:31:41,5
end goal.
>> [INDISTINCT]


295
0:31:41,5 --> 0:31:43,179
>> BRAZIER: Now, I was--I was kind of flailing
around with this, trying to fix this for awhile


296
0:31:43,179 --> 0:31:44,97
and it wasn't until I piece those things together
that it really made sense to me. So, what


297
0:31:44,97 --> 0:31:45,88
I am going to say is, well, when I was researching
the book, I found that of the average of North


298
0:31:45,88 --> 0:31:46,38
America's total stress, 40% could be attributed
to poor nutrition. Forty percent is huge.


299
0:31:46,38 --> 0:31:46,95
Now, at first I thought it was terribly, you
know, we're doing that to ourselves, we're


300
0:31:46,95 --> 0:31:47,549
placing all types of stress on us by making
poor or good choices. But then I realized


301
0:31:47,549 --> 0:31:47,82
that was actually a good thing because we
all control what we choose to eat and we make


302
0:31:47,82 --> 0:31:47,85
those choices obviously. Like I say, we don't
all control these other aspects that cause


303
0:31:47,85 --> 0:31:47,89
stress but we control what we put in our mouths.
So therefore, we have a lot of control over


304
0:31:47,89 --> 0:31:47,919
lowering cortisol and bringing the cause of
these symptoms which of course is overall


305
0:31:47,919 --> 0:31:47,95
stress. So, the high net-gain foods, those
will be the base, that's going to reduce a


306
0:31:47,95 --> 0:31:47,97
large amount of cortisol, therefore a large
amount of overall stress, therefore you're


307
0:31:47,97 --> 0:31:48,1
going to free up a lot of these problems.
I spoke a bit about acid alkaline and I think


308
0:31:48,1 --> 0:31:48,4
that's where the--I'm going to talk a little
more about. That's something that is better


309
0:31:48,4 --> 0:31:48,7
understood now than it was a few years ago,
but as North American's, we're actually getting


310
0:31:48,7 --> 0:31:48,1
osteoporosis at a younger age that's never
before in history. And originally that was


311
0:31:48,1 --> 0:31:48,13
thought--the reason for that is that we weren't
having enough calcium in our diet. It turns


312
0:31:48,13 --> 0:31:48,169
out not to be the case. The reason we're getting
osteoporosis at such a young age because we


313
0:31:48,169 --> 0:31:48,2
take too much calcium out of our bodies and
we do that by eating acid-forming foods, so


314
0:31:48,2 --> 0:31:48,22
anything that is highly processed, white flour,
white breads, synthetic vitamins, synthetic


315
0:31:48,22 --> 0:31:48,25
drugs, meat, dairy, soda, all those are standard
American diet, 100% acid-forming. So what


316
0:31:48,25 --> 0:31:48,29
happens when you eat that? Is your body has
to compensate, it has to off set this acid-forming


317
0:31:48,29 --> 0:31:48,32
food that remains in your body. So what it
does is it pulls calcium which is highly alkaline


318
0:31:48,32 --> 0:31:48,36
out of the bones, into the blood to keep it
neutral. Neutral pH is 7.35, so blood is going


319
0:31:48,36 --> 0:31:48,39
to stay that way as a survival [INDISTINCT].
But in doing so, it draws calcium from the


320
0:31:48,39 --> 0:31:48,419
bones. And you can add, you know, the course
of one, two, or three that [INDISTINCT] every


321
0:31:48,419 --> 0:31:48,45
meal, every snack is being acid-forming. You're
going to get weaker bones and then eventually


322
0:31:48,45 --> 0:31:48,48
osteoporosis. So that's why it's not uncommon
now to see people get [INDISTINCT] who have


323
0:31:48,48 --> 0:31:48,51
died and have osteoporosis in their 20s. So
lastly, that saying, you obviously need alkaline-forming


324
0:31:48,51 --> 0:31:48,53
foods. Alkaline-forming foods are basically
any whole plant-based foods. They're going


325
0:31:48,53 --> 0:31:48,559
to be much more alkaline-forming, the [INDISTINCT]
feeling better they're going to be. The most


326
0:31:48,559 --> 0:31:48,57
alkaline-forming foods are the...
>> [INDISTINCT]


327
0:31:48,57 --> 0:31:48,59
>> BRAZIER: ...green foods so anything with
chlorophyll; spinach, [INDISTINCT], anything


328
0:31:48,59 --> 0:31:48,62
like that, chlorella, spirulina which are
both vegan as well, they're alkaline. Those


329
0:31:48,62 --> 0:31:48,65
really help you to get alkaline. So, base
salad everyday, the best thing to do for your


330
0:31:48,65 --> 0:31:48,679
bones [INDISTINCT] great for your bones. But
another huge advantage to keeping alkaline


331
0:31:48,679 --> 0:31:48,7
is functionality. If you eat acid-forming
food that all promotes inflammation and if


332
0:31:48,7 --> 0:31:48,73
you have arthritis obviously that's, you know,
that's a given, that's going to make a big


333
0:31:48,73 --> 0:31:48,76
difference by just switching over. But even
if you don't, just an average person, do you


334
0:31:48,76 --> 0:31:48,79
think if--you have to work harder for every
muscle contraction because they're inflamed,


335
0:31:48,79 --> 0:31:48,82
you won't even know they're inflamed, that
takes energy. So just walking across the room,


336
0:31:48,82 --> 0:31:48,85
you don't have to spend energy obviously to
do that and if you spend it, you have less


337
0:31:48,85 --> 0:31:48,89
of it. So by the end of the day, you're going
to be more tired which obviously again, you


338
0:31:48,89 --> 0:31:48,919
know, it's just creating a more efficient
body by reducing inflammation that is going


339
0:31:48,919 --> 0:31:48,95
to free up your ability to move efficiently.
Now, to an athlete, that becomes more important,


340
0:31:48,95 --> 0:31:48,98
you know, if you think of all the muscle contractions
during a 5K to 9K marathon, triathlon, there's


341
0:31:48,98 --> 0:31:49,2
a lot. So, if you have to work hard for every
month, you're going to needless to say spend


342
0:31:49,2 --> 0:31:49,4
energy inefficiently. So, by eating these
alkaline-forming foods, functionality improves


343
0:31:49,4 --> 0:31:49,7
because it's [INDISTINCT]. Now, obviously
I'm an endurance athlete, so it's all about


344
0:31:49,7 --> 0:31:49,1
the strength to weight ratio, I want to be
strong but I want to stay light and that's


345
0:31:49,1 --> 0:31:49,14
a great way to do that. Obviously, getting
this way, you know, keeps it pretty lean and


346
0:31:49,14 --> 0:31:49,169
pretty light but what about if you want to
grow a muscle? What if you're body building?


347
0:31:49,169 --> 0:31:49,21
What is you're a power lifter and you want
to put on some muscle? Can this type of eating


348
0:31:49,21 --> 0:31:49,24
help? And yes, it can. Right after a workout,
you're inflamed, your muscles are far down


349
0:31:49,24 --> 0:31:49,27
from--and from the exercise and your body
has to rebuild, so you need protein as building


350
0:31:49,27 --> 0:31:49,29
blocks. But the problem is a lot of proteins,
animal-based protein weight, protein--anything


351
0:31:49,29 --> 0:31:49,32
from an animal is going to be more acid-forming.
So if you eat alkaline-forming proteins, plant-based


352
0:31:49,32 --> 0:31:49,35
proteins like [INDISTINCT] proteins, spirulina
proteins, alfalfa, anything like that, rice


353
0:31:49,35 --> 0:31:49,37
proteins, those things have chlorophyll in
them, they're more alkaline-forming, they're


354
0:31:49,37 --> 0:31:49,39
going to reduce inflammation right after workout.
Now, when you reduce inflammation after your


355
0:31:49,39 --> 0:31:49,419
workout--like I say, your functionality goes
up. When your functionality goes up, you're


356
0:31:49,419 --> 0:31:49,45
ability to life with heavier weight improves.
So you'll be able to lift heavier weight next


357
0:31:49,45 --> 0:31:49,48
time you're in the gym, which is--what makes
it bigger and stronger, lifting heavier weight


358
0:31:49,48 --> 0:31:49,51
is what build bigger and stronger muscle.
So, eating this way in itself is not going


359
0:31:49,51 --> 0:31:49,549
to make you stronger or bigger but it will
allow you to train harder, you're just going


360
0:31:49,549 --> 0:31:49,58
to get bigger and stronger. So, this kind
of paves the road into that. Now, I'll talk


361
0:31:49,58 --> 0:31:49,61
specifically to about some other ways to reduce
overall stress. I talked about obviously perception


362
0:31:49,61 --> 0:31:49,63
of different things, receiving and stress
[INDISTINCT] and food. [INDISTINCT] the high


363
0:31:49,63 --> 0:31:49,65
net-gain foods, the alkaline-forming foods,
but there's something called maca as well.


364
0:31:49,65 --> 0:31:49,679
It's spelled M-A-C-A, it's a root vegetable
from Peru and it's grown at around 15,000


365
0:31:49,679 --> 0:31:49,72
feet. And as with any plants, it's really
a suppliant for the nutrient that are in the


366
0:31:49,72 --> 0:31:49,74
soil. So it draws nutrition, vitamins and
minerals--well minerals, draws them out and


367
0:31:49,74 --> 0:31:49,78
it and extracts vitamins in its tissue by
doing that and then it passes it onto the


368
0:31:49,78 --> 0:31:49,809
animal or the person who eats it. So it's
really a conduit for good quality soil. Now,


369
0:31:49,809 --> 0:31:49,84
what makes maca eating is it has the ability
to grow in this very difficult planet; so


370
0:31:49,84 --> 0:31:49,88
very hot in the day, very cold at night, other
plants can't grow at this altitude but maca


371
0:31:49,88 --> 0:31:49,91
can. So it's monopolized all the nutrients
from this volcanic soil and it will pass it


372
0:31:49,91 --> 0:31:49,94
on to you which helps rebuild the [INDISTINCT]
function. So, that was around seven or eight


373
0:31:49,94 --> 0:31:49,97
years ago, I found out about maca and started
adding it to my [INDISTINCT] grain and it


374
0:31:49,97 --> 0:31:50,1
made a big difference. It took about six weeks
to kick in but once it did, I noticed better


375
0:31:50,1 --> 0:31:50,4
sleep quality right away and I noticed just--obviously
then--so sleeping better, you have more energy


376
0:31:50,4 --> 0:31:50,7
and then you have sugar cravings, starch cravings,
all those things. So it kind of got things


377
0:31:50,7 --> 0:31:50,1
back on track. So if you're eating those highly
alkaline-forming foods and if you're eating


378
0:31:50,1 --> 0:31:50,13
those high net-gain foods and you still find
you have the symptoms of stress which are


379
0:31:50,13 --> 0:31:50,15
general fatigue, [INDISTINCT] and apnea and
sugar cravings, starch cravings especially


380
0:31:50,15 --> 0:31:50,179
in the evening, dependence on stimulants such
as coffee and sugar, difficulty toning muscle,


381
0:31:50,179 --> 0:31:50,21
moving fat event though you exercise, all
those things. Those are signs of high cortisol.


382
0:31:50,21 --> 0:31:50,25
Those are signs that you're probably in a
lot of stress in your life which is the most


383
0:31:50,25 --> 0:31:50,27
high and that's in North America. Especially,
you know, with high achievers where people


384
0:31:50,27 --> 0:31:50,32
got a lot to do; if you've got a lot of things
to work on, on projects, a lot of big stuff


385
0:31:50,32 --> 0:31:50,35
to do. It's a--you know, it's the norm. So,
that's normal. It's how you--how you off set


386
0:31:50,35 --> 0:31:50,39
a lot with it, the nutrition that can make
the difference. So, like I say, I eat about


387
0:31:50,39 --> 0:31:50,419
two and a half grams of [INDISTINCT] a day,
help me get through that. So, you may want


388
0:31:50,419 --> 0:31:50,45
to consider that. It isn't [INDISTINCT] as
well so if you are having [INDISTINCT] a day,


389
0:31:50,45 --> 0:31:50,48
you won't get that anyways. And like I say,
we'll have--we'll have some [INDISTINCT] to


390
0:31:50,48 --> 0:33:50,48
try.
