###32 So let's say we were doing geoengineering
###34 because we wanted to make the weather
###35 a little bit better.
###37 There'll be monsoon failures during that period.
###39 There'll be huge hurricanes.
###41 The global studies indicate there will be
###43 some impact on precipitation patterns.
###45 Might involve large-scale regional agricultural disruption
###48 lasting a number of years.
###50 Potentially two billion people could have their food disrupted
###53 by such interventions.
###55 That the aerosols can-- at least in these models,
###57 simulations, or indicated by these simulations--
###60 can offset most climate change in most places most of the time
###62 for both precipitation and runoff.
###65 But it's likely to cause some damage in some places.
###83 [theme music playing]
###96 When I grow up, I wanna be either an artist or a teacher.
###100 I wanna grow up in a world where there's lots of nature.
###102 I love nature.
###104 How can I look my children in the eyes...
###115 and not try to shed the light on this issue,
###118 knowing every breath they take is--is laden with these metals?
###122 I have been forced to conclude that there is no greater
###126 or no more immediate threat to anything
###128 that lives and breathes
###129 than the global geoengineering programs,
###132 short of nuclear catastrophe.
###135 Geoengineering is defined as the artificial modification
###138 of the earth's climate.
###139 Geoengineers are proposing spraying 10 to 20 million tons
###142 of toxic aluminum and other substances into our sky
###146 for the stated goal of cooling our planet.
###148 So let me distinguish these two different, uh, kinds
###152 of geoengineering as clearly as I can.
###154 So the first one is--we call solar radiation management,
###157 and that's the idea that you could put reflective,
###160 mostly reflective particles or other means
###162 to make the earth whiter,
###163 effectively to increase the earth's reflectivity,
###166 reducing the amount of--of heat that's absorbed by the sun
###169 and therefore exerting some overall cooling tendency
###171 on the earth.
###172 I think, though, the initial results of climate models
###177 indicate that reflection of sunlight away from the earth
###179 can offset most climate change in most places most of the time.
###183 But it will damage some places.
###187 We've mostly thought about sulfur.
###189 Nevertheless, there might be some good reasons
###190 to think about aluminum.
###191 Turns out, first of all, there's been a lot of work
###193 on the environmental consequences of aluminum
###194 in the stratosphere.
###195 There's a bunch of papers going back to the '70s
###197 that look at the radiative and ozone--
###199 ozone destroying properties of aluminum in the stratosphere,
###201 and those make you think it might be useful.
###203 Do this in just a jet in a very simple way.
###205 Make high-quality aluminum particles just by spraying
###208 aluminum vapor out, which oxidizes.
###209 So it's certainly, in principle, possible to do that.
###211 Since we released "What in the World Are They Spraying,"
###213 hundreds of people from around the world
###215 have began taking rain tests.
###218 What they're finding is what many are calling
###220 the chemtrail geoengineering footprint
###222 of aluminum, barium, and strontium.
###229 So we're finding this Welsbach footprint internationally,
###233 all over the world, wherever they take samples
###235 and get a, uh, chemical analysis of rain and snow water.
###239 This is quite common.
###249 Wherever you see the jet chemtrails go over,
###253 you're gonna get aluminum, barium, strontium
###256 coming down on you.
###257 Why would we not believe that it's happening
###259 when what we see in the sky matches exactly the express goal
###263 of numerous geoengineering patents, about 160 or more?
###267 Why would we not believe this is happening when every element
###269 showing up in the rain tests are the primary elements named
###273 in those geoengineering patents?
###274 Why would we not believe this is happening when we have
###277 escalating levels in very short time frames, as much--
###280 as short as five years, we see rain levels
###283 of aluminum, for example, escalating as much as 50,000%?
###286 California air quality studies do not show these metals
###289 migrating from China, and it's of recent origin.
###292 So, you know, this bombardment of heavy metals
###294 that's raining down on us is coming from somewhere.
###297 Why would we not believe geoengineering is occurring
###300 when the weather patterns are so altered here
###303 in exactly the manner stated by geoengineers
###306 and reports on the consequences for geoengineering,
###308 which are diminished rainfall,
###309 which are increased ozone destruction.
###312 We have a massive ozone hole in the Northern hemisphere now.
###314 Should aluminum be in the soil and the rain?
###317 And yes, it should be in the soil.
###319 It's naturally there.
###321 Always was there.
###322 And should it be in the rain?
###324 Well, absolutely not.
###326 But the standard reply has been, "Your samples are contaminated."
###331 But since we are getting samples now that show zero aluminum,
###335 and we're getting lots of barium and strontium
###337 and zero aluminum.
###338 So that just proves that if there was dirt in our samples
###343 of some sort, dust blown up from the ground,
###346 we should get some aluminum in some detectable quantity.
###353 The primary ingredients in geoengineering are specifically
###356 the oxides of metals, including aluminum oxide.
###368 This is devastating plants, totally devastating.
###371 The trees are dying. Why?
###374 Approximately two years ago, I rode in the back--
###376 and you can ride in the back of my place for miles.
###379 You can go all the way through the woods, you know,
###382 creeks and everything, and it was--I say was--gorgeous.
###385 And the day before yesterday, I took a ride,
###389 and I rode in the back, and what I found
###391 was total devastation.
###394 As I pointed out before, Michael, we're seeing,
###397 as in this example here, very hardy, native plants
###400 completely flash out dead.
###402 That looks like it's been hit with some kind of a chemical.
###404 And we've only seen this in the last couple years.
###407 And there's another one there, there, back over there.
###410 We're seeing mature madrone trees,
###412 which are 70, 80 feet high, flash out dead just like this.
###416 USDA refuses to investigate it.
###418 The pH typically around here should be about 5.6.
###421 Well, since the contrailing got heavy,
###424 I watched the pH here in these forests, well,
###427 go up I guess would be the word.
###429 from 5.6, it went about 20 times more alkaline.
###433 Very big red flag of fallout from these materials
###437 are pH changes to the forest floor.
###439 We have very extensive studies
###442 from the U.S. Department of Agriculture
###444 on the soils in our region,
###445 and those soils have changed in five to six years.
###448 The pH's have changed in this-- in this area
###452 as much as 10 to 12 times toward alkaline in five to six years.
###455 I've personally been in the forest testing
###457 with USDA soil scientists who just scratched their heads
###461 and seemed to have no explanation
###463 for incredibly profound changes in pH,
###466 which is affecting the ecosystem here tremendously.
###469 Aluminum buffer action, aluminum hydroxide
###472 is what we think it is,
###473 uh, plus the barium carbonate, strontium titanate,
###479 strontium oxides, barium oxides,
###482 probably some aluminum oxides in there.
###484 But this has apparently driven our acid soils
###490 about 20 times more alkaline, to about 6.8.
###493 There are simply too many dots here that connect.
###496 Our skies are almost never blue anymore.
###498 That is a named consequence of geoengineering.
###500 The amount of lost sunshine hitting the planet right now
###504 is beyond belief.
###506 If people look up the term "global dimming," they will see
###507 that fully 20% of the sun's rays that reached the planet
###510 several decades ago are no longer reaching the planet.
###513 I mean, that's a profound change that few people even know
###515 is occurring.
###517 And you have very visible occurrences in the sky
###520 from the aircraft, a very visible sun blocking,
###523 expanding, dingy trails that are exactly
###527 what geoengineering patents describe.
###528 Heavy aluminum--I'm talking, like, in the 40s and 50s,
###533 up to 3,000, 4,000, 5,000-- that's still common.
###536 Uh, barium, strontium, to, um, oh,
###542 somewhere 40 or 50 to, again,
###545 about 2,000 or 3,000.
###547 Same for both barium and strontium.
###550 Where is this mountain of metal coming from?
###552 Why is asthma, A.D.D., Alzheimer's, autism--
###555 all elements related in many studies to aluminum
###559 or particulate inhalation--
###561 why are these el-- why are these ailments
###562 going off the charts with no apparent explanation?
###566 Why has respiratory mortality in the continental United States
###569 gone from eighth on the list to third in six years?
###572 And no one seems to ask any questions,
###573 why everybody, uh, every other person has asthma now,
###577 why every other commercial on TV is an allergy medication.
###581 And again, when David Keith,
###583 the world's most recognized geoengineer,
###585 was asked on the record, had there been any studies done
###588 as to the consequences of dumping 20 million tons
###590 of aluminum into the atmosphere,
###591 his answer was patently, "No."
###593 While geoengineers claim that their models
###595 are to cool the planet, a number of studies now are arising
###599 that indicate, yes, temporarily,
###601 there will be, regionally, cooling as these particulates
###605 reflect the sun.
###606 However, they actually at night act as a blanket
###609 and will warm the planet.
###611 So the question now remains,
###612 "Why in the world are they spraying?"
###615 One of the things that geoengineering is about,
###618 when you're environmentally doing something
###620 with the atmosphere,
###622 is that you can be engaged in weather modification.
###625 Historically, weather modification
###627 in the United States began to be looked upon
###629 in the 1940s as something that people would want to do.
###641 And so they started looking at making it--enhancing snow,
###645 enhancing rain.
###646 They started looking at hurricane control.
###649 There was a whole bunch of projects in the '40s
###652 that started.
###653 One was Project Stormfury, which turned into a disaster
###656 when they tried to modify a hurricane.
###659 I'm Mark McCandlish.
###668 And for the better part of 30 years, I worked
###670 in the Aerospace and Defense Industry.
###673 I had a secret clearance twice during my career.
###676 Some of the technology that I saw or participated
###680 in the creation of tends to play a role
###683 in, um, some of the things that are used to control the weather.
###688 The very distribution processes being employed
###691 in the aerosol campaign--
###693 manipulating the weather, crops, um, you know,
###696 taking over the--the, uh, the food production
###700 or controlling the food production,
###702 the military applications--
###703 the process evolved when they realized in the--
###707 in the 1800s that you can put things into the environment
###710 that will influence the uptake of moisture
###713 and where it drops out of the atmosphere again.
###726 My name is Scott Stevens.
###735 I, uh, was a television weatherman for 20 years.
###738 These chemtrails are absolutely required to impact
###743 whatever weather event they were designing.
###746 And the trails were an absolute necessary ingredient
###750 for them to achieve their weather modification goals.
###753 So we're finding the aerosols, the metal particulates,
###757 all of those can be used and leveraged to create
###761 weather events that are several standard deviations
###764 or outside what would be typically normal.
###767 When the geoengineering really got underway with the Russians
###769 in the mid-'70s, we ended up with snow in Miami.
###772 We ended up even with frost deep into Mexico.
###775 You know, the bizarreness of the weather really exploded
###778 on the scene when, uh, when weather engineering
###780 got going in the mid-'70s.
###782 The Dakotas, in winter, they recorded a temperature
###785 of almost 100 degrees, 94 degrees.
###788 It broke the former record by 32 degrees.
###790 There's very profound things that people don't notice.
###792 Blue skies almost never.
###794 We almost never have dew on the ground.
###796 That's a known consequence of geoengineering, if they did it,
###798 which they appear to be.
###799 It sucks the moisture out of the atmosphere.
###801 It doesn't descend, doesn't form dew.
###802 We have massive temperature disruptions.
###804 People are starting to wonder, "Why is it 80 degrees one day
###807 "and then snowing the next day at 50 degrees or 45 degrees,
###810 and then back up to 80 the day after that?"
###812 When you push and pull the climate with these--
###815 these manipulations programs, of which there's
###817 a mountain of data to corroborate their existence,
###820 then you start to have massive fluctuations in the system.
###824 And we saw in March, in the continental U.S.
###827 there were 15,232 temperature records broken.
###830 That's profound.
###832 Some of the daytime highs, the former records were broken
###834 by as much as 32 degrees.
###837 Don't people wonder what in the world is going on?
###840 Whether they want to make it snow at 45, 46, 47 degrees--
###844 I remember when 38, 39 was a big deal.
###847 Those kind of snowfalls in the upper 30s.
###850 And now that's been pushed into the 40s.
###852 There's a patent called
###854 "Ice nucleation for Weather Modification".
###857 This is a patent from NASA.
###859 It can be found online in its full form.
###862 This patent is for the creation of artificial snowstorms
###867 from what would have been rainstorms.
###869 However preposterous it sounds to people,
###871 if they look up "Chinese create snowstorms",
###874 they will find a long list of articles
###878 where the Chinese Bureau of Weather Modification
###880 openly admitted that they were creating snowstorms
###883 until they did a billion dollars' worth of damage
###885 in Beijing.
###886 So my question would be, if the Chinese can do this,
###889 and NASA has a patent for the same purpose,
###892 why would we believe snow events here are natural,
###895 when it's snowing now, regularly, at 45 degrees,
###898 sometimes 50 degrees--
###900 heavy, wet, concrete snow that's full of aluminum,
###903 full of barium, full of strontium?
###905 Consider the ice pack in their first aid kit
###908 that can sit dormant at room temperature for decades,
###911 until the chemicals are mixed together,
###913 at which time it creates ice.
###914 As an on-air meteorologist,
###916 I had a responsibility to my audience.
###919 There were storms that were not behaving as they were modeled
###922 or they historically would have responded.
###925 If you can control where moisture is collected
###929 and where it's dropped, so to speak,
###933 in the form of rain or any other kind of precipitation,
###935 then you can really--you can do everything.
###938 You can steer the weather system.
###939 If you want to be able to manipulate the weather,
###943 one of the things we know about the materials
###945 that are being used in the aerosols--
###947 we--we've seen everything from aluminum oxide,
###951 barium salts, strontium, copper sulfate,
###955 uh, potassium iodide, um,
###958 a number of different kinds of things,
###959 each of which have different levels of reactivity
###962 with the moisture in the air.
###964 Some, like aluminum oxide,
###966 tends to sequester the moisture.
###968 The aluminum oxide nanoparticles,
###970 which are microscopically fine and uniform in size,
###974 attract the humidity and the moisture in the air,
###977 and they can--it basically forms like a nucleation process,
###981 where the moisture condenses on these particles.
###983 The--with cloud seeding, the cooling will be achieved
###985 by making clouds reflect a bit more sunlight
###988 back to space than they would otherwise.
###990 And less sunlight reaching the surface would tend
###992 to cool the planet.
###994 These aerosol particle act-- particles act
###996 as something called cloud condensation nuclei,
###998 and, um, this is--these are sites where--
###1002 these particles act as sites where cloud drops can form.
###1006 Well, the one thing that we know has happened is,
###1008 because these are nanoparticles,
###1011 and they float like mad with a little bit of, uh,
###1015 moisture added to them.
###1017 They go over the Continental Divide.
###1019 They dumped all of California's rain
###1021 into the Mississippi Valley, which is the reason
###1024 they're having floods and tornadoes and fierce storms
###1028 and odd weather back east.
###1030 The effect here in California is drought.
###1033 Now, then, if you hit that area of the sky
###1036 with a beam of a particular kind of radiation,
###1040 and you can heat those particles up,
###1042 just like heating up, you know,
###1044 your--your cup of coffee in the microwave,
###1047 these particles begin to vibrate and resonate,
###1050 if you use the right frequency of--of, uh, RF energy,
###1054 that they then heat the surrounding air,
###1056 and they will take all of that air
###1058 and the moisture that is in it
###1059 to a higher altitude, where it's much colder,
###1061 and it'll condense and then become a low pressure system.
###1064 Well, there--there's a couple of locations
###1068 where they tend to be very interested
###1069 in--in leaving their trails.
###1072 The big one and the surprising one for me
###1074 is under areas of high pressure,
###1076 where you would--you would expect to see the blue skies,
###1078 the dry conditions.
###1079 Those are prime targets for trailing.
###1083 Couple of reasons:
###1084 High pressure is--is stable.
###1086 It's relatively still.
###1088 You know, we've got the, uh-- the clockwise flow around it.
###1091 And if you accentuate the high, so it's very easy
###1095 to add those particulates of aluminum, barium,
###1097 and whatever else they want to put in there,
###1099 and as you add heat to that,
###1101 those particulates then radiate the heat
###1103 into the atmosphere, and it warms.
###1106 And what does a warming atmosphere do?
###1107 Boom, it expands.
###1110 So that's one way.
###1111 It's a very simple way, but it's very apparent,
###1114 because under the high pressure, it's supposed to be quiet.
###1117 It's supposed to be still.
###1118 It's supposed to be blue.
###1120 And we're not seeing that.
###1122 Then as the storm approaches, the high begins to recede.
###1126 And then they're running the flights back and forth,
###1128 back and forth, back and forth,
###1130 and literally seeding the leading edges of the cirrus.
###1133 So the cirrus canopy is accentuated.
###1136 That cirrus canopy, which would maybe be 200, 300 miles
###1140 at a head--at a head of a cold front is now 400, 450 miles.
###1146 Based on geoengineering data,
###1150 it would appear the Pacific Northwest gets
###1154 an excessive amount of-- of the fallout
###1157 from these programs, because much of the weather,
###1160 much of the precipitation in the storm tracks
###1162 and the jet stream move across us.
###1165 So, as stated by globally recognized geoengineers
###1168 like David Keith,
###1170 that that's the type of area they would want
###1172 to seed these particulates,
###1174 as incoming fronts start to cover landfall,
###1179 and that's exactly what we see here.
###1180 When there's any kind of incoming front,
###1181 we see jets everywhere.
###1183 The global studies indicate there will be some impact
###1186 on precipitation patterns,
###1188 and obviously, there's a lot more opportunity
###1189 for work in that area.
###1190 After studying my time lapse surveillance,
###1193 one of the reasons I discovered for the trails
###1195 was that the persistent ones would break.
###1198 They would misshape it or deform,
###1199 and other planes would come along and precisely mark off
###1202 those locations of-- of deformation.
###1204 And you're not gonna get that with a regular fleet,
###1206 so this had to be one of the primary purposes
###1209 for chemtrails, in my opinion, was to measure off
###1212 where we have these discontinuities showing up
###1215 in the atmosphere.
###1216 And in doing these actions and discovering those zones
###1219 where there's different energies in the atmosphere,
###1221 I think that plays very closely
###1223 into their weather engineering programs
###1226 of mark, surveil, and then that data goes
###1229 into--into a weather model that they can then use
###1231 to forecast, or, once again,
###1233 engineer the weather to their designs.
###1235 But you can also influence what happens locally
###1239 with the atmosphere by, um,
###1242 painting the materials that these aerosols are made of
###1247 with different kinds of radio frequency, or RF energy--
###1250 radar, microwave, the HAARP system.
###1254 You know, HAARP is, um, uh, an array,
###1257 a field of antennas, radio frequency antennas.
###1259 They're 72 feet tall, then they have a crosstie
###1262 pulled across the top that's about 60 feet in each direction.
###1265 180 of these are in the array today,
###1268 so you can imagine this field of antennas.
###1271 What happens is, by firing each one,
###1275 they produce radio frequency energy that normally comes off
###1278 of an antenna, spreads out rather rapidly.
###1280 Same principle...
###1290 principles in physics would be like a flashlight
###1292 shining on a wall.
###1293 You know, you start with a narrow beam,
###1295 and by the time you hit the wall, you've got a wide beam.
###1297 The idea with HAARP is to get it to focus or concentrate
###1301 that radio frequency energy so it doesn't spread out,
###1303 so you can hold it tighter together and then manipulate it
###1307 in very specific ways.
###1308 Weather control is a broad topic.
###1311 So there's lots of ways to control or manipulate weather.
###1313 HAARP is one of them.
###1315 Because you also have private sector companies
###1317 getting into this business of weather modification.
###1320 In the case of HAARP, do you need, uh--
###1323 People always ask me, you know,
###1324 "Do you need particulates dispersed in the atmosphere
###1327 to make it more effective?"
###1328 You actually don't.
###1330 Would it make things more possible?
###1331 Could you enhance certain effects?
###1333 Probably so.
###1334 Could you control energy distributions more efficiently?
###1336 Probably so, because you're putting in conductors
###1339 or you're putting in reflectors.
###1341 You're putting in particulate material.
###1343 If you've ever experienced a hailstorm
###1345 and you've picked up one of the hailstones,
###1346 and you slice it open with a razor blade,
###1348 you'll see that it's layer upon layer upon layer of ice.
###1352 Now, hail is usually formed where you have
###1355 a low-pressure system
###1356 where there's a tremendous updraft of air.
###1358 The air gets warmed up by the sunlight
###1360 ahead of the storm.
###1361 The air rises.
###1363 It takes the moisture that's in the air
###1365 up to a higher altitude, where it's much colder.
###1367 The moisture begins to condense into water droplets,
###1371 but the updraft is so powerful that the water is carried
###1373 to extreme altitudes, where it freezes,
###1376 and it begins to fall.
###1378 And as it falls, it starts to be caught up
###1381 in the updraft again,
###1383 so it's circulated up into the air again.
###1385 And so each time it's lofted up into the atmosphere,
###1388 more of the moisture that is condensing on the outside
###1391 of this-- this nuclei of ice
###1393 begins to form another layer, another layer.
###1396 And each time it's caught back in the updraft,
###1398 it goes up again, and it gets another layer of ice.
###1400 And so, if you have a system like HAARP
###1404 working in conjunction with aerosols,
###1407 chemtrails that are spraying in the air,
###1410 you can actually create updrafts that are so powerful
###1413 that you can have these hailstone circulation patterns
###1415 going over and over again, where you get hailstones
###1417 the size of baseballs, or even softballs.
###1438 The weather has always been a strategic...
###1449 desire to control by the generals,
###1451 whether it was Napoleon, marching towards Moscow,
###1454 or Hitler, in his Russian campaign,
###1457 or our own Pacific fleet trying to understand typhoons
###1462 and use them for our strategic advantage.
###1464 War and weather are very closely connected.
###1467 And they've been connected ever since about 1812 or so,
###1471 maybe earlier than that.
###1473 Hannibal had to face the snows in the Alps.
###1475 And so there's a long history
###1477 of weather and warfare interactions.
###1480 Environmental manipulation is like the ultimate method
###1484 of covert warfare because you can literally shut down
###1486 food production.
###1487 You can create a situation where the people
###1490 within a country revolt against their own government,
###1493 and you're invited in to mop up the mess.
###1496 The issue of owning the weather by 2025,
###1498 it's this military publication.
###1500 We've quoted it as far back as, I think, '94 or '95, even.
###1505 But you go back to these earlier reports,
###1508 and you look at, sort of, what was the objective?
###1511 And the objective is exactly that:
###1513 control the battlefield environment.
###1515 Environmental factors give you an absolute advantage.
###1519 If you can weaken your adversary before you have to fire
###1522 the first bullet, maybe you even win the war.
###1524 Whether it's incredibly historic sandstorms
###1527 when we're invading Iraq,
###1529 or you want to drought out or flood out a dictator
###1531 that you're not happy with
###1533 or obscure a beach when there's a landing,
###1535 or if you just want to make money on the futures market.
###1538 Owning the weather by 2025, using the weather
###1543 as a force multiplier.
###1544 And this kind of goes back to what I was saying before
###1546 about if you can--
###1547 if you can control where a weather system goes
###1551 and how much or how severe the weather system is,
###1555 then you can do other things.
###1558 Like you may have heard more recently
###1562 that many of the aircraft that we've been developing
###1564 are what they call "all-weather capable,"
###1566 which means that they can fly in any kind of weather.
###1568 They can shoot and target the enemy
###1572 under really nasty weather circumstances.
###1575 And these are all things that you can use to your advantage
###1577 if you happen to be controlling the weather, also,
###1579 because you can have a terrible storm front come in
###1582 and make it difficult, if not impossible,
###1584 for the enemy to operate on the ground
###1586 or to fly their aircraft
###1588 if they don't have aircraft that are as sophisticated
###1591 as the ones that you have.
###1593 And so, by creating or using the weather
###1596 as a force multiplier, as the title implies,
###1600 that you can achieve an advantage over an enemy force
###1604 that gives you the upper hand.
###1606 One of the ideals of the-- of the Air Force
###1608 is to have this all-weather Air Force,
###1609 or to have their pilots coming back safely
###1613 and using the weather as a salient against the enemy
###1616 and clearing out their own airports
###1618 from, say, from ice, fogs, or from bad weather.
###1621 And so if we could--if-- the idea here is that
###1623 if we can fly and they can't,
###1624 that's a great military advantage.
###1627 There was also research studies on hurricanes
###1630 that the scientists were truly curious about the behavior
###1633 of hurricanes,
###1635 but their military patrons were very interested
###1637 in how to steer them or direct them in certain ways,
###1640 almost as a-- as a guided weapon.
###1642 This jet stream's moving across, and it shoots
###1645 50 miles north and then 75 miles east
###1649 and then drops back south again and kind of goes on its way.
###1652 And they attributed that little dog leg
###1654 in the jet stream in Alaska
###1656 to swinging storm systems out of Central Texas
###1660 into Central Florida,
###1662 where they deposited a couple of tornadoes
###1664 in the middle of Orlando
###1665 that were, like, really rare to see in that part
###1667 of the country.
###1668 And so people remember that event,
###1669 and they remember that situation.
###1671 But it'd be a good example of a very small change in Alaska
###1674 in terms of a jet stream,
###1676 and what kind of a lower-48 effect
###1678 that would have.
###1679 And that's again where weather modification,
###1682 small input in one place could have tremendous change
###1686 and unexpected outcome in another.
###1688 You can create weather systems that are so severe,
###1691 they culminate in battlefield denial,
###1696 where the enemy is not able to use the roads
###1699 or the bridges or--or get through the environment
###1702 because the weather is so severe.
###1704 And you can--you can use the weather to destroy his crops,
###1709 deny him a food source, destabilize his population,
###1713 because people get hungry, and when they're hungry,
###1715 they get angry and nasty, and they don't like
###1717 what's happening.
###1718 So there's lots of different things that you can do
###1720 with the materials.
###1721 It's all how you use them in the environment,
###1723 how you apply it.
###1724 One of the biggest concerns of early cloud seeding
###1728 weather control activities by the General Electric Corporation
###1732 came from their lawyers, who thought that the corporation
###1735 was totally vulnerable to lawsuits
###1737 because if they started to make fair or foul weather,
###1741 the people down below in Massachusetts,
###1743 or downwind of Schenectady
###1746 could institute massive lawsuits that could put G.E.
###1750 out of business.
###1752 So the first response to weather control
###1754 from their in-house lawyers was to shut it down,
###1758 was to give the project to the military
###1760 and ask them to do it, with the G.E. lawyers
###1763 only being the consultants on the project.
###1765 So they were allowed to suggest and, uh,
###1768 design certain activities,
###1769 but they weren't allowed to touch anything
###1771 or throw anything out of the plane.
###1772 The United States government, during the Vietnam War,
###1775 perfected weather modification techniques,
###1778 and also they perfected releasing toxic chemicals
###1781 like Agent Orange over many areas to defoliate land,
###1786 trees, grasslands, and other areas.
###1789 But this is technology that does come up,
###1792 and it comes up when-- when you see
###1793 that the technology has advanced far enough
###1795 to where the practicality of utilizing it
###1798 in the battlefield environment
###1799 and the temptation by administrations--
###1802 I mean, the best covert war is using environment itself
###1805 against your adversary.
###1807 There was a military moment, and it was actually
###1808 from pretty recent history,
###1811 and this was the U.S. military thinking
###1814 that they might be able to control the monsoon
###1817 over Vietnam during that conflict.
###1820 And so only a few--a handful of top-level military advisors
###1824 and the president were informed that they were going to try
###1828 to make it rain over the Ho Chi Minh Trail
###1831 and try to have some military advantage
###1832 by doing this kind of intervention.
###1834 When you start talking about manipulating the environment,
###1837 we have treaties that go back to the mid-'70s
###1838 that forbid this, number one, as weapons of war.
###1841 So the perfection of weather modification took place,
###1844 but it became apparent that using weather modification
###1848 for wartime purposes was not acceptable
###1850 to the United States government
###1852 and other nations of the world.
###1854 So therefore, the ENMOD Treaty came into being
###1857 and was signed by the United States government
###1861 after passing Congress.
###1863 The reason it was signed and implemented
###1865 was because it would ban
###1867 warfare weather modification techniques
###1870 and use during times of war.
###1873 Almost all of our treaties that we've signed,
###1875 including the non-proliferation, counter-proliferation treaties,
###1877 chemical treaties--you know, the ones that were signed
###1879 recently, the last few years,
###1881 uh, you know, back maybe a decade now, I guess.
###1883 Times goes.
###1884 But they had domestic exemptions,
###1888 and so does the environmental treaty,
###1890 where you can do whatever you want
###1891 in your own territorial boundaries.
###1894 I mean, you start manipulating weather in one part of-
###1895 of the planet, it doesn't look on the ground and say,
###1897 "Oh, yeah, wait. This is the boundary of--
###1899 a political boundary."
###1900 It fails to recognize those.
###1902 So you start to talk about geophysics
###1905 and manipulating the planet itself.
###1907 Then it's a question of-- those kinds of exemptions
###1910 shouldn't even be allowed.
###1911 Meteorology and the military
###1913 have a very long history, as I said.
###1915 And it goes into this strategic advantage that multiplies
###1919 your traditional force-- that is, your armament--
###1923 into using nature to your advantage as well.
###1930 They want to create a storm in the Southeast,
###1934 then they'll start engineering out of the North Pacific.
###1936 That's where the trails will be,
###1938 because you want to work out
###1939 several days ahead of time so you have less input.
###1943 And you multiply that over a couple of days,
###1945 you can have a big result in five days' time.
###1948 So small input upstream, big result downstream.
###1952 And one of the rules is always work with what's coming.
###1956 Don't try to necessarily work against it.
###1957 You can kill a storm in place. That's easy to do with HAARP.
###1960 You just change the polarization.
###1961 You change the ionization of the atmosphere,
###1963 and the storm will fall apart.
###1965 It will affect the setting up of the storm tracks,
###1967 the jet stream, the location of the storms,
###1970 and so you end up with-- an intervention
###1972 on the solar side of things would pretty directly begin
###1977 to affect the weather patterns.
###1980 And so climate control, or attempted climate control,
###1982 and weather control lie on this very large spectrum
###1985 of intervention.
###1987 It's also true that if you can forecast climate,
###1990 you can control a lot of futures markets,
###1992 and you could know--if you had the best information,
###1995 or if you had some leverage over what the climate system
###1999 is going to turn out to be,
###2000 you would be able to invest in advance
###2002 and own your crop futures
###2004 and your agricultural activities and--
###2006 And not just agriculture, but weather affects--
###2009 I think it's something like 80% of the U.S. economy
###2011 is weather-sensitive.
###2013 And so all kinds of businesses would like to see
###2016 some weather edge or some advantageous information
###2021 that they would have.
###2023 It's absolutely, entirely possible to profit
###2025 from the weather.
###2034 Hi, my name is Michael Agne.
###2035 I'm an independent trader...
###2045 trading commodities at the C.M.E. Group,
###2048 member of the Chicago Board of Trade,
###2049 and I've traded derivatives and futures cash
###2051 for over 15 years.
###2053 Weather derivatives are financial instruments
###2055 that firms would use to hedge risk
###2057 concerned with adverse weather conditions.
###2059 The first weather derivative was originally traded by Enron
###2062 back in 1997.
###2064 Weather derivatives started in 1999 at the C.M.E. Group.
###2066 Big utilities reinsures to hedge against hurricanes
###2070 or tornadoes or flooding, some sort of catastrophe.
###2074 Hedging against a cooler summer or a warmer winter.
###2077 Let's just say I was insuring a product for 5 million,
###2080 no matter what it was.
###2081 Let's say if it was a utility company,
###2082 a farmer, whatever it was.
###2083 Let's say I had $5 million worth of crop,
###2085 but I can do derivatives that are worth double that amount,
###2087 and I can then control the effects
###2090 to where I collect on the insurance
###2092 that's worth 10 million,
###2093 as opposed to selling the crop for five million.
###2095 Yes, I could definitely profit from that.
###2096 2010, 2011, Southern Illinois, Missouri,
###2099 those--those, you know,
###2100 we had a high peak of tornadoes,
###2102 and those types of adverse weather conditions
###2104 definitely raised the price of commodities
###2106 as well as drove the volatility,
###2108 which also raises the price of commodities.
###2110 You're gonna make more money if a crop fails.
###2112 You're creating insurance that's over the price
###2114 of what your crop is worth, let's say.
###2116 So what if you can control the weather?
###2117 You control how these products grow.
###2120 And if you had an insight
###2122 to how these products were actually seeded
###2124 and what products you used to actually grow those items--
###2128 corn, soybeans--and you can control that market,
###2131 it's unlimited profit potential if you can control the weather.
###2134 If you want to send you know, cold into the Midwest,
###2137 you buy at pipeline capacity,
###2138 you buy up options on heating and cooling degree days.
###2141 You buy derivatives off of-- off of rainfall.
###2144 There are mechanisms that you can make
###2146 hundreds of billions of dollars annually
###2149 and defray a huge chunk of the cost of this
###2152 just on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
###2154 playing with derivatives in the weather market.
###2156 Weather derivatives are basically--
###2158 you're betting that there's gonna be a weather disaster,
###2160 and you're betting that it's going to occur
###2163 within a particular timeframe in a particular location,
###2166 and then, you know, the money that you put up
###2168 basically is like a bet.
###2170 It's like a wager saying that, uh,
###2172 this incident's gonna happen here.
###2175 And then, when it does happen, there's a big payoff.
###2179 And that big payoff is something that motivates people
###2182 to continue to participate in this kind of thing
###2184 and maybe even feed the very process
###2186 that's causing the bad weather to happen,
###2189 particularly if there's a connection
###2190 between the people that are seeding the clouds
###2192 and the people that are making investments.
###2194 This is a new opportunity.
###2197 It's a new tool for investors.
###2208 You know, even if, uh,
###2209 someone has no interest in, you know,
###2211 going on the offensive side and buying things, um,
###2215 it definitely behooves them to be aware
###2217 of what's going on out there.
###2218 The extreme weather is here.
###2220 You know, and it's not gonna reverse itself.
###2222 The weather event has to be severe.
###2225 Ionospheric heating, in fact,
###2227 these instruments, um, when they were first utilized,
###2229 which was in the former Soviet Union back in the '70s--
###2232 they started out then--
###2233 they still call these ionospheric heaters
###2235 because, in one mode of operation,
###2237 you can literally create--
###2239 above this instrument on the ground,
###2240 you can heat an area 30-- up to 30 miles in diameter
###2244 in the ionosphere.
###2245 So you heat it up, and by heating it,
###2247 it literally raises it.
###2248 So you can then imagine this column
###2250 moving up several hundred kilometers out,
###2252 and then the lower atmosphere begins to rush in
###2255 and fill that vacant space, that void.
###2258 And then, as a result, you're altering pressure systems
###2261 for, you know, quite a-- quite a distance,
###2264 which of course alters the weather.
###2265 You're also able,
###2266 if a jet stream is coming in the area,
###2268 you're able to alter its course.
###2269 And if you alter a jet stream even a small amount,
###2272 then the swing factor on the other end,
###2274 you can move it, so you're moving storms, say,
###2276 out of the Midwest onto the East Coast
###2278 or this kind of thing,
###2279 by just swinging it high in-- in terms of its flow
###2283 and getting it redirected.
###2285 Okay, so now if we look at precipitation,
###2287 much has been made of this issue of, uh,
###2291 damage from precipitation.
###2292 Which the particulates that these trails intro--
###2294 have a--have introduced into the sky are--
###2299 Let's just say the storms can develop more violently,
###2301 more quickly, um, in places that are
###2303 not necessarily as, uh, where you would expect them to be.
###2307 And so we see more flooding.
###2308 We see more intense droughts.
###2310 We see rainfall rates of 1 to, you know,
###2313 2 1/4 inches an hour
###2314 that are just bizarre.
###2316 And sometimes even rainfall, you know, 1 1/4 inch a minute.
###2319 It's just unheard of.
###2321 And so you have an area that's already been heated
###2323 by the sun's rays,
###2324 and then you have the aerosol drift in over that area.
###2327 And it's reflecting both ways.
###2329 It's reflecting the heat of the sun back out,
###2330 but it's also trapping the heat
###2332 that's already been created there by the sunlight.
###2335 So it will actually create more heat and trap heat inside
###2339 and closer to the atmosphere.
###2340 It can actually exacerbate global warming problems.
###2344 And if you become more aware of what's happening,
###2345 where the global commodities are,
###2347 what extreme weather events, you're one step ahead of them.
###2360 The nature of the risk and our ability to respond to the risk
###2363 is much greater in the case of the scenario
###2367 that might involve
###2368 large-scale regional agricultural disruption
###2371 lasting a number of years.
###2372 So the agenda was drought.
###2375 The agenda was to kill the storm
###2378 at least in that one particular spot.
###2381 You see a tremendous and significant loss of property
###2385 and, uh, crop production.
###2387 Many times, this will cause farms to go out of business,
###2391 and when farmers go out of business,
###2393 they usually have to sell.
###2394 And then if there's somebody waiting in the wings
###2396 to buy their land and then turn that land over
###2400 to the production of genetically modified crops,
###2404 you can see where there would be
###2406 kind of a strategic advantage there.
###2408 There's something that happened in the Midwest,
###2409 and I'm sure everybody's heard about the flooding
###2411 in the Midwest.
###2412 And what happened is, um,
###2414 George Soros and his big corporate monolith
###2417 went in and started buying up the farmland.
###2421 So not only is it--is it creating all these stresses,
###2427 it appears to be a corporate land grab.
###2430 In other words, when the farmers,
###2432 the small farmers go out of business,
###2434 they're wiped out through these droughts and everything,
###2437 then the big guys come in, buy up the land.
###2440 And if you think of Western history,
###2443 there's a lot of it concerning water rights
###2445 and even water wars.
###2447 And so they were shooting about access to, uh, water,
###2451 to water your livestock.
###2453 And now people are thinking,
###2455 or at least the people who are involved in weather control
###2457 sometimes think about the river of moisture
###2461 above our heads, and,
###2462 "Jeez if we could just tap that."
###2464 But that too is a, uh, a water right that would involve
###2469 access to, uh, to people that felt like maybe they had
###2473 prior rights over it.
###2475 And you're reducing the food security of people
###2478 through deploying these kinds of approaches that...
###2481 Potentially 2 billion people could have their food disrupted
###2484 by such interventions.
###2502 I've been an organic farmer my entire life...
###2514 and I've been, um, in the last eight years,
###2518 been certified organic.
###2520 And so I've been growing food in a way that feels healthy,
###2525 where I have the most energy, and now it's not so healthy.
###2529 I want to pass a really nice, healthy soil,
###2534 rich soil earth on to the children
###2537 and have it be fertile.
###2539 My name is Joel Gilcoca.
###2541 I've been farming on this land for about five years...
###2552 since 2007, and I'm certified organic since 2001.
###2559 Ten years ago, when I started working for myself,
###2563 we can grow cilantro, no problem.
###2565 We can grow basil, no problem.
###2567 We can grow Chinese cabbage without get trouble
###2571 or any vegetable.
###2573 But ten years after--I mean, five years after that,
###2577 everything start decline.
###2579 Could you add something to the environment
###2580 that would affect a large population?
###2582 The answer is absolutely yes.
###2583 I started seeing chemtrails being laid overhead
###2587 more frequently
###2588 and noticing the change in the crop production.
###2590 What we see in our area
###2592 anytime there's convective clouds,
###2594 anytime there's a large cumulus cloud forming
###2596 and beginning to rise,
###2598 we hear aircraft in the vicinity.
###2600 We see them actually flying over these convecting clouds,
###2603 and then in a very short time,
###2605 before those clouds generally will drop any precipitation,
###2608 we'll see the entire cloud more or less dissolve
###2611 into what looks like a massive smoke bank.
###2614 If you can control the weather,
###2616 then you can control where the rain falls
###2620 or where it doesn't fall.
###2622 And if you can do that,
###2623 then you can control whose crops survive
###2625 and whose crops thrive.
###2628 And if you happen to be favoring, um, a corporation
###2634 or a group of corporations that are flooding the market
###2637 with genetically modified crops,
###2640 you can see how manipulating the weather
###2644 can actually change the market share
###2647 that one or more corporations have.
###2650 Um, and there's, you know,
###2653 there's lots of different ways that you can do it.
###2655 You can do it by denying precipitation
###2658 or by giving too much.
###2660 You can cause, uh, you know,
###2663 unusually large hailstones to come out of the sky
###2665 and completely obliterate a crop of corn.
###2668 There's lots of different ways that you can do it.
###2671 Um, you know, tornadoes, rip up an entire town,
###2675 like Joplin, Missouri, I think it was.
###2678 If you look back at the tapes of those weather systems,
###2682 and you look five days prior to that,
###2685 you'll see that in those days preceding those events,
###2689 there was all kinds of aerosols being sprayed
###2691 all along the California coastline,
###2693 where the moisture for those storms came from,
###2696 where those storm systems originated.
###2698 You know, it's-- I mean, it's insidious,
###2700 when you think about it.
###2701 Oh, my God, I've seen, since the chemtrails have come,
###2704 there's a direct correlation with the way the health--
###2708 The food doesn't look as healthy and vibrant,
###2711 and less of it.
###2713 And that concerns me.
###2715 And of course, all crop losses are related
###2718 to weather modification problems.
###2720 Either climate, uh, worldwide weather,
###2723 or local weather, which is called micro-climates.
###2729 And these micro-climates definitely determine
###2733 what crop grows where and in which community.
###2736 And so, therefore, without stable micro-climates,
###2739 we can not produce as much food
###2741 for the rest of the world and ourselves
###2744 as when we have more stable micro-climates,
###2746 not only in the United States, but in other countries as well.
###2749 We fertilize it really good,
###2751 and they still have a lot of trouble to produce.
###2755 And I think this is not fun,
###2756 because we losing a lot of money
###2759 put them into this kind of production.
###2763 In 2008, 2009, three times I losted my complete planting
###2768 of Chinese cabbage.
###2769 Weather events is one of the key components
###2771 to most, uh, commodities that are traded.
###2773 Let's just say your agricultural group--corn, soybeans, wheat,
###2778 something along those lines,
###2779 weather is by far the largest, uh, affecting factor
###2784 in the price of those commodities.
###2786 If one farmer's crop fails,
###2789 we have a major crop failure, say, in corn,
###2793 now that's going to affect every other company
###2796 that uses corn in their manufacturing process.
###2798 There's gonna be less of it.
###2799 And anytime there is less of something,
###2802 that creates a price rise.
###2804 Demand rises. Okay?
###2806 Because there isn't any of it.
###2807 There's only one thing.
###2809 You've got five people that want it.
###2810 So they're gonna pay more money for it.
###2813 The companies know that.
###2814 So they're gonna hike the prices up anyway.
###2816 The consumer actually sees the big brunt end
###2818 of the higher, you know, cost in the commodity
###2822 due to the adverse weather condition.
###2823 Obviously, the consumer will pay that price.
###2825 I've noticed that the rainfall is less predictable,
###2829 and then, when it does rain,
###2831 it does rain periods of time that's more,
###2835 more, like, longer periods.
###2838 So not only do we have the pollution,
###2842 not only do we have stunted growth,
###2845 but we also have changes in weather.
###2848 And there's been severe changes in weather
###2850 all across the globe.
###2851 I don't have a clue how bad they are,
###2853 but I know they are affecting already in the--
###2856 in certain plants, you know, like basil, cilantro,
###2859 and sometime the broccoli get too much, uh, fungus.
###2864 It can be from those thing because, um,
###2867 no matter what we do, it doesn't fit.
###2870 It not working right.
###2871 It appears to be a fungally related ailment.
###2874 And if one looks at the species extinction rate,
###2877 which today is estimated to be
###2880 1,000 times natural variability,
###2882 that's 1,000 times normal,
###2884 a figure you'd think would alarm most reasonable people,
###2887 which is 100,000% of normal,
###2889 and 70% to 80% of that extinction,
###2892 plant and animal, is related to fungal infection.
###2896 Geoengineering particulates are known to proliferate
###2899 fungal reproduction.
###2901 Abiotic stresses are drought, cold, heavy metals,
###2906 excess moisture in the soil,
###2909 and Monsanto has a patent that actually addresses
###2913 all of those abiotic stresses.
###2915 And the plants that it addresses
###2918 is everything from apples to zucchini.
###2920 2011 was one of the worst years
###2924 for things that create abiotic stress.
###2926 They had 12 worldwide severe weather problems.
###2933 This destroyed a good portion of the food supply.
###2936 Now I'm having a hard time growing cherry tomatoes outside
###2938 under these conditions,
###2940 and I've turned to having to build a greenhouse,
###2944 where I'm now growing large tomatoes, heirlooms.
###2949 And they are producing really nice, big tomatoes.
###2953 I see that the tomatoes that I planted now are really healthy,
###2958 and the ones outside are dying.
###2960 The Midwest grows 40% of the world's corn.
###2965 And it does have a tendency to flood,
###2966 so we can expect more and more flooding,
###2969 according to the statistics.
###2970 The E.P.A. statistics say that there's going to be
###2972 more and more flooding.
###2974 Monsanto is one of the world's largest chemical companies.
###2986 They also own 90% of the seed companies
###2990 in the world right now,
###2992 and they are the largest company
###2996 putting out genetically modified seeds.
###2999 So what does Monsanto do?
###3000 Corn is the lead-in because corn is in just about everything.
###3005 Corn is the main crop,
###3007 and Monsanto leads in with corn products
###3009 before it does anything else.
###3011 So what we have is Monsanto leading in
###3014 with a drought-resistant corn
###3016 and an abiotic-stress- resistant corn.
###3019 The drought and the flooding, it's all the same patent.
###3021 Monsanto has a patent for abiotic stress.
###3025 Abiotic stress is the drought.
###3027 It's the flooding. It's the excess soil.
###3029 It's anything that's going to stress a plant.
###3032 G.M.O. is Genetically Modified Organism,
###3035 and it's also called G.E., Genetic Engineering.
###3039 Well, the history of farming has been,
###3041 a farmer will plant a seed into the ground,
###3043 and there will be nutrients in the ground
###3045 that will enable that plant to grow,
###3048 and then at the end of the growing season,
###3050 they will take some of the seeds,
###3051 and they will save them for next year,
###3054 and they'll grow their next crop.
###3056 But what is going on with the genetically modified seeds
###3059 is they're what's called terminator seeds.
###3061 A terminator seed will not produce other seeds.
###3066 With the terminator seeds,
###3068 these farmers have to go back to Monsanto every single year
###3072 and purchase these extremely high-priced seeds.
###3075 There have been studies outside of the United States
###3079 showing that genetically modified seeds,
###3083 the plants that come from them,
###3085 are extremely harmful to humans and other life on this planet.
###3090 Uh, when I started farming,
###3092 I produce 100% my crops.
###3094 But in the last four years,
###3097 I've been declined to 50%, 75%
###3101 if I took into later crop,
###3103 because I've been lost everything.
###3106 And that's why I start moving all different crop,
###3108 so I can cover the loss.
###3110 Well, my food production has declined at least by 60%
###3115 in the last, I don't know, ten years.
###3118 I've noticed banana stalks are smaller,
###3121 and certainly the tomatoes-- I'm hardly getting any.
###3125 I use to get bushels of tomatoes,
###3127 and now I can barely get a bowl.
###3130 My concern--it can be, you know.
###3133 It's possible if they go-
###3135 we go and run out of business if they continue doing that.
###3138 They really need to stop they're doing.
###3140 That's all I believe,
###3142 because we cannot change the system, you know,
###3145 the Mother Nature.
###3146 We have to keep going the way it is.
###3150 It's not possible.
###3151 On the other hand, the, you know,
###3153 heat stress is going to be one of the things,
###3156 or thought to be one of the things
###3157 that might limit production of crops
###3159 throughout the tropics.
###3160 And so there are some questions of tradeoffs,
###3163 of, you know, when--
###3165 if you think you're gonna benefit many people
###3167 and harm some people,
###3168 how do you deal with this issue of equity, and what--
###3174 I mean, what are the options for dealing with that?
###3178 A really interesting thing that I've found
###3180 is that the E.P.A. has concluded
###3182 that incidents of heat stress,
###3185 drought, flooding, cold, any type of abiotic stress
###3191 is on the increase.
###3193 And loss due to that is going to double by 2030.
###3198 Then you put yourself up as the solution.
###3202 So when all of this weather comes and wipes you out,
###3207 or you have a drought problem,
###3208 "Oh, drought? We've got the seed for you.
###3212 "Here is our drought-tolerant corn, just for you,
###3215 "and it'll solve your problems.
###3217 "Oh, by the way, you have to sign this agreement,
###3221 "this 40-page agreement,
###3224 "so that when you go ahead and plant these seeds,
###3229 you now belong to Monsanto."
###3231 The weather disasters seem to be directly correlated
###3234 to an increase in Monsanto's sales.
###3237 So there will be the have and the have-nots.
###3240 And one of the things that's being discussed
###3242 under global geoengineering
###3244 is which countries will be the haves
###3245 and which countries will be the have-nots
###3248 when that type of climate remediation is undertaken
###3252 by many people at a certain level,
###3256 mostly private corporations funded by the U.S. government,
###3259 they are hoping.
###3260 The fact that it's cheap isn't necessarily a good thing at all.
###3263 As I'll come to in a second, the fact that it's cheap
###3265 is part of the hard problem of governance.
###3267 The fact that it's cheap means any small state
###3269 or even, conceivably, individuals could do this.
###3272 And that is a very dangerous thing.
###3274 There's only probably under $10 million per year,
###3277 and maybe far less than that,
###3279 being spent on geoengineering research.
###3281 Um, it's a mix of a handful of government grants
###3285 and some private money,
###3287 including support from Bill Gates.
###3290 Bill Gates invests in geoengineering.
###3292 Geoengineering destroys crops.
###3294 Monsanto supplies the seed to replace those crops.
###3299 Bill Gates invests in Monsanto,
###3301 so Bill Gates makes a ton of money,
###3304 Monsanto makes a ton of money,
###3306 and the small farmer gets squashed.
###3309 Corn prices go higher
###3310 because of a severe drought in this country,
###3313 um, you know, where 41% of the country--
###3315 the world's supply of corn comes from.
###3318 So corn prices are higher. The farmer has more money.
###3320 So what does he do?
###3321 He buys fertilizers, which dries up the mosaic stock,
###3325 and--or he could purchase
###3327 genetically modified seeds from Monsanto.
###3330 You've got severe, severe drought in Africa.
###3333 In 2011, there was a severe drought.
###3336 This is causing nothing but death.
###3338 It's causing starvation. It's causing malnutrition.
###3341 It's causing a severe water shortage.
###3344 How do you grow anything without water?
###3346 You cannot grow anything without water.
###3350 So what does Monsanto do?
###3352 They say, "Oh, we got a drought-tolerant corn for you."
###3357 There's been an excessive push
###3360 to get bioengineered crops into Africa.
###3363 They look at severe conditions as an opportunity.
###3367 They're disaster capitalists.
###3370 So here you have farmers, and they've got flooding,
###3373 they've got droughts,
###3375 they've got everything that totally wipes them out.
###3377 So what happens?
###3378 Okay, they--if they plant it early enough in the year,
###3380 they can go ahead and try and plant again.
###3382 So buy more seed.
###3384 Okay? Buy Monsanto seed.
###3385 So they're just raking up on that end of it. Okay?
###3389 So if you can create enough weather manipulation,
###3391 you can shorten growing seasons,
###3394 you can create enough of that disaster,
###3397 and you've got the seed supply,
###3400 they've got to come to you.
###3408 Geoengineers have stated on the record
###3409 that if global geoengineering were started,
###3411 it could cause droughts in Asia and Africa.
###3415 And they state that to the American public
###3416 for probably obvious reasons.
###3418 Why would they tell the American public
###3420 that it could also cause droughts here?
###3422 Why wouldn't it cause droughts here?
###3424 There's nothing special about America
###3426 and the geography here
###3429 that would not have the same effect as Asia and Africa.
###3431 If the atmosphere is filled with particulates,
###3434 those particulates diminish and disperse rainfall, period.
###3438 There's too many condensation nuclei,
###3440 so the water droplets do not combine and fall as rain.
###3443 They simply adhere to those tiny particles and migrate further.
###3446 And that's exactly what we see.
###3449 One of the suggestions about geoengineering has been
###3453 that we genetically modify trees and plants,
###3457 um, we genetically modify crops to be aluminum resistant,
###3461 and this is ongoing at this time.
###3464 And part of the geoengineering scheme is to say,
###3467 "We're gonna put all these chemicals and particles
###3469 "into our atmosphere,
###3470 "which is going to cause air pollution, water pollution,
###3473 "changes in soil pH,
###3475 "and could disrupt agriculture crop production
###3477 to a great degree."
###3479 So, therefore, instead of saying that maybe this isn't
###3482 a good idea that we pollute our air, water, and soils
###3484 with the chemicals we're gonna put into the atmosphere,
###3487 which do come back down,
###3489 there's a scheme abounding which is happening right now
###3492 to modify some crops so that they are aluminum resistant
###3496 to the types of chemicals and particles
###3498 they're gonna put into the atmosphere.
###3500 It's just gonna get worse until the point
###3502 where we're not gonna able to grow anything at all
###3504 unless it's a Monsanto genetically modified,
###3508 abiotic-stress-resistant seed.
###3511 The chemical companies and the genet--and Monsanto
###3515 and all of these companies are working together
###3517 to make us totally dependent on their products
###3520 for growing corn or growing any kind
###3523 of agricultural product or trees, whatever.
###3525 We're going to corporatize not only where the rainfall goes
###3530 and who gets it
###3531 through geoengineering and weather modification schemes,
###3534 but we're also going to say that these are gonna be
###3537 the only crops that are gonna grow
###3538 in areas where we're putting in toxic chemicals
###3542 that are coming down and altering the soils.
###3544 One of the most basic things about human society
###3547 is that we need food and water.
###3550 And these are two of the things that, uh,
###3557 are most severely dependent upon good weather--
###3561 rain at the right time of the year,
###3563 sunshine so crops can grow.
###3564 Not enough sunshine, and they don't grow.
###3567 Too much water, the plants die.
###3569 Not enough water, the plants die.
###3571 All of this goes back
###3572 to the amount of food that's available.
###3575 So if you starve people, they will be vulnerable.
###3582 They will be much easier to manipulate and force to do
###3586 whatever the government wants them to do.
###3589 So if you control how much food there is or its availability
###3594 through things like the weather
###3596 or using the weather as a strategic tool, militarily,
###3601 um, you can, you know, dramatically influence
###3605 what's going on in the country.
###3607 And by doing that over and over again
###3611 sequentially through a region, um,
###3614 it's possible that you can change the, um,
###3618 the political spectrum over an entire region
###3622 by doing this over and over again.
###3624 Um, maybe even, you know,
###3626 do it over a much wider region.
###3628 Create so much instability that you're able to, you know,
###3631 come in and say, "Oh, we have these wonderful,
###3633 "fast-growing crops, you know, genetically modified.
###3635 "And you know, this-- you'll have--
###3637 you'll have something to eat in less than three weeks."
###3640 You know, um, and I imagine that, uh, you know,
###3644 if you can control the food supply,
###3647 that you can then consolidate the financial
###3650 and the political interests of a country.
###3653 Could predicting the weather enable a group
###3657 or a specific entity to profit from that knowledge
###3663 of knowing what type of weather or weather pattern will be?
###3665 Absolutely.
###3666 That's what all commodities are driven by.
###3668 They're driven by predicting the weather,
###3670 how the weather will be in a certain location,
###3672 and that directly is correlated
###3674 to the price of that commodity.
###3675 Absolutely. There's no doubt.
###3692 While there are a number of agendas associated
###3695 with these damaging programs,
###3697 one thing is for sure:
###3698 They can be used to control our weather
###3701 and thus corporatize every natural system on the planet.
###3704 This enables certain individuals to consolidate
###3707 an enormous amount of both monetary and political power
###3711 into the hands of a few,
###3712 at the expense of every living thing on the planet.
###3717 Just by definition, the geoengineering programs
###3719 are a direct assault
###3721 on the most elemental aspects of nature.
###3723 What we're doing when we modify the weather
###3726 is we're changing the world's climate,
###3729 and we're changing the micro-climates.
###3731 And we are doing it.
###3733 There are things we can say for certain.
###3735 There's a mountain of metal raining down on us.
###3736 We're certainly breathing that metal.
###3739 We have documented from the computer modeling
###3742 some unintended consequences.
###3744 If such a contamination is present,
###3746 shouldn't we investigate?
###3747 Shouldn't local agencies investigate,
###3748 which they have patently refused to do?
###3750 There's no question that large-scale climate engineering
###3753 is untested and dangerous.
###3755 I would disagree quite strongly that it is--
###3758 um, doesn't exist.
###3759 I think that the capacity to do it in engineering terms
###3762 most certainly exists, and that's part of the reason
###3764 we have to think seriously about how we manage that.
###3767 We are breathing a mountain of metal,
###3769 and that can't be denied.
###3770 If geoengineering continues,
###3771 and the weather manipulation continues,
###3773 and genetic modification continues overtaking,
###3776 we're going to lose our ability to grow
###3779 good, nutritious food.
###3781 We are going to lose our ability to thrive.
###3784 I personally consider this ongoing toxic dumping
###3787 into our atmosphere to be, along with nuclear radiation,
###3791 the most dangerous threats to our health
###3794 and to our environment.
###3795 We've seen UV scales go off the charts,
###3798 which are a known consequence of geoengineering,
###3800 ozone destruction.
###3801 We've seen rainfall patterns disrupted in ways
###3803 that meteorologists don't seem to be able
###3805 to explain or predict.
###3806 The challenge that all of these weathermen face,
###3808 all of them, whether they're aware of it or not--
###3811 sooner or later, they will be aware of it.
###3814 And I went through a period after the epiphany of,
###3818 "How did I not see this sooner? How?
###3821 "I mean, seriously,
###3822 "I'm supposed to do this for a living.
###3824 How did I not see this?"
###3826 We have--seem to have lost our moral fiber
###3829 and our ethical compass when we talk about
###3832 that we all should live within an experiment
###3833 that somebody else is conducting.
###3835 If you knew or could predict the weather at any given time
###3840 in any given area,
###3841 then you control the fate of mankind
###3843 and what they pay for everything.
###3845 Washington is not responsive to the average person.
###3848 It's responsive to commercial interests,
###3850 who can spend millions on campaigns now
###3852 without restriction, who literally drive
###3855 the policy-making in Washington, D.C.
###3857 I guess I'm under the belief
###3859 that you can't control the weather.
###3861 Um, you know, I hope someday we could control the weather.
###3864 Power becomes an addictive thing.
###3867 We're taking what the Creator has created,
###3870 usurping his authority, and bringing it
###3872 under the authority of corporations.
###3877 I'm worried that one person or one group
###3880 would try to have that much leverage over the whole planet.
###3883 I don't believe that anybody has the right to play God,
###3888 especially when they're putting particles and chemicals
###3890 into the atmosphere,
###3892 which there's unintended--
###3893 and consequences that are known.
###3895 We don't know it all.
###3897 We can not assume the role of Creator
###3899 without dire consequences.
###3901 This is not a good idea.
###3903 And this is not a reason to take and do a test.
###3907 The atmosphere and the earth belong to all of us.
###3909 It provides the food we eat, the air we breathe,
###3912 the water we drink,
###3913 and no one should have the right to own it.
###3916 The biosphere is at risk from top to bottom.
###3918 Though you have climate scientists
###3920 calling for emergency geoengineering due to events
###3923 like methane mass expulsion,
###3924 which appears to be occurring in the Arctic...
###3926 It would have a significant impact
###3929 on the way that we operate.
###3932 Notice it also has enormous political, social,
###3936 and economic implications.
###3938 And so we don't want to have some giant planetary oops,
###3941 I mean, capital oops, in which you have a loss of life.
###3945 It's much, much harder to actually figure out
###3949 the environmental risks and effectiveness
###3950 of these new methods than it is to cook them up.
###3952 They're creating an artificial environment
###3955 to replace the natural environment.
###3959 Shredded ozone layer, global droughts,
###3962 toxified soils, poisoned populations.
###3966 Don't these issues matter?
###3968 Affecting ecosystems in ways we've never been able before.
###3972 Um, the whole concept of literally playing God
###3976 with the technology we have at our fingertips today.
###3979 And however the climate changes,
###3981 wouldn't we be better to let the planet react on its own,
###3984 instead of trying to play God?
###3986 It doesn't have any benefits to society at all.
###3990 It doesn't benefit the plant.
###3991 It doesn't benefit the farmer.
###3993 It doesn't benefit the environment.
###3995 It's all about money,
###3996 and weather is another form of commoditizing,
###3998 a way the central command group can commoditize
###4000 another form of our life.
###4001 Whereas the E.P.A. has stated that there is going to be
###4004 more weather,
###4006 and they're attesting it to climate change.
###4009 Well, I agree.
###4011 It's changing.
###4012 The weather's changing.
###4014 Now, the real issue is, is it natural or is it manmade?
###4019 And if it's manmade, who's doing it?
###4024 Is it the geoengineering guys?
###4027 That's what I believe if geoengineering continues,
###4029 that whatever changes are happening to the planet,
###4031 we will exponentially worsen those changes
###4034 and poison everything in the process,
###4036 and, indeed, with the amount of metal falling on us,
###4038 that poisoning appears to have been occurring now
###4041 for quite some time.
###4043 Why are you spraying that stuff in our sky?
###4045 It's accumulating massive amounts of wealth
###4047 in very few hands.
###4049 And that's what they're trying to do
###4050 in all aspects of these economies.
###4051 The money's not worth it. This is my future.
###4054 I encourage people to get involved in the projects
###4056 they're interested in,
###4057 whether it's this one or some other one.
###4058 To thrive, we need to organize
###4061 locally, nationally, and globally
###4064 to expose and stop this practice immediately.
###4067 Please quit free-riding on our future.
###4069 But do what you can do.
###4071 And I think that's really the answer for all of us,
###4073 is recognize that there is a network more powerful
###4076 than the Internet.
###4078 It's the human race.
###4079 We are connected in a way that's quite powerful.
###4081 The fact is, acting on what we know to be right and true,
###4085 doing something about what we care about
###4088 that we can do.
###4089 Please tell everyone you know about this.
###4092 Bring this message to community meetings,
###4095 demonstrations, and other public events.
###4098 The work we're doing will provide cover
###4100 for others to come out.
###4102 And I'm most interested in whistleblowers.
###4105 Send this film to environmental farm groups,
###4109 media groups, A.D.D., Alzheimer's, asthma groups,
###4112 and other organizations that would do something
###4115 if they only knew.
###4116 Because we deserve-- deserve a future.
###4120 And if you control the weather,
###4123 you're in control of the planet.
###4126 It's that simple.
###4127 Some people address this issue in fear.
###4130 Some people address it in anger.
###4132 I address this in faith.
###4135 Faith believing that we, collectively, as human beings,
###4139 as humanity, have the power and the ability
###4143 to stop these damaging programs.
###4158 [Skull's "Cry Die"]
###4162 All right, now here we go.
###4168 All right, now here we go.
