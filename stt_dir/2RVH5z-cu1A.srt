0:7:11,67 --> 0:7:12,0
AND ALL THAT, BUT I HAD TO CALM


215
0:7:12,0 --> 0:7:13,233
MYSELF DOWN AND JUST REMEMBER


216
0:7:13,233 --> 0:7:14,433
THAT IT'S ANOTHER HOCKEY GAME.


217
0:7:14,433 --> 0:7:15,5
I'VE BEEN PLAYING HOCKEY MY


218
0:7:15,5 --> 0:7:16,933
WHOLE LIFE, SO I HAD TO SETTLE


219
0:7:16,933 --> 0:7:18,767
BACK DOWN AND GET BACK INTO THE


220
0:7:18,767 --> 0:7:20,33
GROOVE OF THINGS AND FOCUS ON


221
0:7:20,33 --> 0:7:21,433
THE FIRST SHOT OF THE GAME.


222
0:7:21,433 --> 0:7:23,3
HILL: YOU DIDN'T PLAY FOR FIVE


223
0:7:23,3 --> 0:7:24,267
GAMES. CAN YOU TELL ME THE


224
0:7:24,267 --> 0:7:25,67
REASONING BEHIND THAT? MADOLORA:


225
0:7:25,67 --> 0:7:26,1
I GUESS IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO


226
0:7:26,1 --> 0:7:27,167
WITH THE CLEARINGHOUSE AND THE


227
0:7:27,167 --> 0:7:28,967
NCAA AND THEY SAID THAT WHEN I


228
0:7:28,967 --> 0:7:30,0
WAS GOING THROUGH THE WHOLE


229
0:7:30,0 --> 0:7:32,33
PROCESS OF CLEARINGHOUSE THAT I


230
0:7:32,33 --> 0:7:34,467
DIDN'T SIGN A WAIVER OR CHECK A


231
0:7:34,467 --> 0:7:36,4
BOX OR SOMETHING, SO I GUESS


232
0:7:36,4 --> 0:7:39,133
THEY DEEMED THAT A FIVE GAME


233
0:7:39,133 --> 0:7:41,733
SUSPENSION. WILSON: REALLY, HE


234
0:7:41,733 --> 0:7:43,533
TOOK A WRONG SCIENCE COURSE, HE


235
0:7:43,533 --> 0:7:44,867
TOOK AN AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES


236
0:7:44,867 --> 0:7:46,9
CLASS. HIS DAD'S A FARMER OUT IN


237
0:7:46,9 --> 0:7:49,233
CALIFORNIA, AND IT DID NOT COUNT


238
0:7:49,233 --> 0:7:50,767
TOWARDS THE REQUIRED THREE


239
0:7:50,767 --> 0:7:52,7
SCIENCES THAT HE NEEDED TO TAKE.


240
0:7:52,7 --> 0:7:54,8
HE SAT OUT THE YEAR AND THEN


241
0:7:54,8 --> 0:7:56,133
WHEN HE CAME IN, HE DID ALL HIS


242
0:7:56,133 --> 0:7:58,33
PAPERWORK. HE WAS CLEARLY


243
0:7:58,33 --> 0:7:59,667
ELIGIBLE, BUT WHAT HE FORGOT TO


244
0:7:59,667 --> 0:8:2,567
DO WAS CHECK A BOX BASICALLY


245
0:8:2,567 --> 0:8:4,8
THAT SAYS REQUESTING TO BE


246
0:8:4,8 --> 0:8:6,267
REINSTATED. THAT'S ABOUT THE


247
0:8:6,267 --> 0:8:7,633
BEST I CAN EXPLAIN IT. FOR HIM I


248
0:8:7,633 --> 0:8:9,0
GUESS THE PUNISHMENT WAS FIVE


249
0:8:9,0 --> 0:8:10,7
GAMES BECAUSE HE PLAYED FIVE


250
0:8:10,7 --> 0:8:12,667
GAMES. THANK GOD HE DIDN'T PLAY


251
0:8:12,667 --> 0:8:13,6
30 GAMES. HILL: WHEN YOU HEARD


252
0:8:13,6 --> 0:8:14,7
THE NEWS THAT SHANE WASN'T GOING


253
0:8:14,7 --> 0:8:16,0
TO BE PLAYING FOR A FEW GAMES,


254
0:8:16,0 --> 0:8:17,2
HOW DID YOU AND THE TEAM REACT?


255
0:8:17,2 --> 0:8:18,833
NEW SPEAKER: I THINK IT JUST


256
0:8:18,833 --> 0:8:19,933
KIND OF BLINDSIDED US. WE REALLY


257
0:8:19,933 --> 0:8:21,9
HAD NO IDEA. WE FOUGHT THROUGH


258
0:8:21,9 --> 0:8:24,3
IT WELL. OBVIOUSLY SHANE'S OUR


259
0:8:24,3 --> 0:8:26,167
GO TO GOALIE RIGHT NOW AND HE'S


260
0:8:26,167 --> 0:8:27,167
PROVEN WELL AND IT'S NICE TO


261
0:8:27,167 --> 0:8:29,33
HAVE HIM BACK IN THE LINEUP, BUT


262
0:8:29,33 --> 0:8:30,467
JUST FOR A LITTLE TIME THERE IT


263
0:8:30,467 --> 0:8:31,567
WAS A LITTLE WEIRD. NO ONE


264
0:8:31,567 --> 0:8:33,67
REALLY KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON


265
0:8:33,67 --> 0:8:34,3
AND THEN THERE WERE JUST RUMORS


266
0:8:34,3 --> 0:8:35,967
HERE AND THERE AND WE KIND OF


267
0:8:35,967 --> 0:8:36,933
FIGURED IT OUT AND THAT'S THAT.


268
0:8:36,933 --> 0:8:37,933
NEW SPEAKER: WE TRIED TO STAY


269
0:8:37,933 --> 0:8:38,933
POSITIVE ABOUT THE WHOLE


270
0:8:38,933 --> 0:8:40,633
SITUATION. I DON'T KNOW ALL THE


271
0:8:40,633 --> 0:8:41,833
DETAILS, BUT SHANE'S A GREAT


272
0:8:41,833 --> 0:8:42,833
GOALIE, HE'S THE BEST IN THE


273
0:8:42,833 --> 0:8:43,833
LEAGUE AND HE SHOWED IT AGAIN


274
0:8:43,833 --> 0:8:45,1
TONIGHT. HILL: WAS IT HARD TO


275
0:8:45,1 --> 0:8:46,533
WATCH YOUR TEAM AND YOU COULDN'T


276
0:8:46,533 --> 0:8:47,5
DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT? MADOLORA:


277
0:8:47,5 --> 0:8:48,733
YEAH, IT WAS DEFINITELY


278
0:8:48,733 --> 0:8:50,867
FRUSTRATING TO COME TO THE GAME


279
0:8:50,867 --> 0:8:51,867
AND TO HAVE TO SIT IN THE STANDS


280
0:8:51,867 --> 0:8:53,733
AND HAVE PEOPLE COME AND ASK


281
0:8:53,733 --> 0:8:54,733
YOU, "WHY AREN'T YOU PLAYING?


282
0:8:54,733 --> 0:8:56,267
WHAT'S GOING ON?" EVERY SINGLE


283
0:8:56,267 --> 0:8:58,7
GAME FOR WHAT SEEMED LIKE A HALF


284
0:8:58,7 --> 0:9:0,3
HOUR STRAIGHT ALMOST, BUT IT WAS


285
0:9:0,3 --> 0:9:1,433
DEFINITELY FRUSTRATING TO HAVE


286
0:9:1,433 --> 0:9:2,567
TO SIT THERE AND WATCH,


287
0:9:2,567 --> 0:9:3,5
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE WERE


288
0:9:3,5 --> 0:9:4,8
STRUGGLING A BIT FOR A FEW


289
0:9:4,8 --> 0:9:5,967
GAMES. IT WAS HARD; IT WAS


290
0:9:5,967 --> 0:9:6,967
DIFFICULT. HILL: HOW GOOD DOES


291
0:9:6,967 --> 0:9:8,733
IT FEEL TO HAVE SHANE BACK?


292
0:9:8,733 --> 0:9:9,867
WILSON: GOOD. COMFORTING THAT


293
0:9:9,867 --> 0:9:10,967
YOU'VE GOT YOUR NUMBER ONE


294
0:9:10,967 --> 0:9:12,3
GOALIE BACK, SOMEONE THAT YOU


295
0:9:12,3 --> 0:9:13,6
CAN RELY ON, SOMEONE THAT'S BEEN


296
0:9:13,6 --> 0:9:15,333
TESTED, SOMEONE THAT'S PROVEN


297
0:9:15,333 --> 0:9:17,367
HIMSELF, CERTAINLY LAST YEAR AND


298
0:9:17,367 --> 0:9:18,8
EVE IN SOME GAMES AND THE YEAR


299
0:9:18,8 --> 0:9:20,767
BEFORE. NEW SPEAKER: SHANE OVER


300
0:9:20,767 --> 0:9:22,733
THE LAST YEAR OR YEAR AND A


301
0:9:22,733 --> 0:9:25,333
HALF, HE'S PLAYED REAL WELL FOR


302
0:9:25,333 --> 0:9:27,33
US. HE'S A GAMER, AND HAVING HIM


303
0:9:27,33 --> 0:9:28,433
BACK IN THE NET TONIGHT HE


304
0:9:28,433 --> 0:9:29,533
SHOWED WHY HE'S THE NUMBER ONE


305
0:9:29,533 --> 0:9:31,333
GUY. HE PLAYED REAL WELL. HILL:


306
0:9:31,333 --> 0:9:32,633
NOW WITH SHANE GONE FOR ALMOST A


307
0:9:32,633 --> 0:9:33,733
MONTH, WERE YOU WORRIED HE MIGHT


308
0:9:33,733 --> 0:9:35,467
BE A LITTLE RUSTY COMING BACK


309
0:9:35,467 --> 0:9:36,7
IN? WILSON: I THOUGHT MAYBE HE


310
0:9:36,7 --> 0:9:38,2
WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT RUSTY AND


311
0:9:38,2 --> 0:9:39,767
THEN MAYBE JUST PRESSING A


312
0:9:39,767 --> 0:9:41,333
LITTLE BIT. HE WAS HIS OLD SELF.


313
0:9:41,333 --> 0:9:43,367
HE JUST KIND OF PLAYS VERY


314
0:9:43,367 --> 0:9:45,8
STRONG AND HE DOES A GREAT JOB.


315
0:9:45,8 --> 0:9:47,9
HE DOES GIVE US CONFIDENCE AND I


316
0:9:47,9 --> 0:9:49,467
THINK WE'RE ABLE TO BUILD OFF OF


317
0:9:49,467 --> 0:9:51,4
THAT AND A COUPLE SAVES EARLY IN


318
0:9:51,4 --> 0:9:53,67
THE GAME I THINK SOLIDIFIES THAT


319
0:9:53,67 --> 0:9:54,67
FOR US AND HE WAS GOOD TO HAVE.


320
0:9:54,67 --> 0:9:55,233
HILL: WHAT DOES IT DO FOR THE


321
0:9:55,233 --> 0:9:56,133
TEAM'S CONFIDENCE, NOT ONLY TO


322
0:9:56,133 --> 0:9:57,5
HAVE YOU BACK, BUT YOU KNOW,


323
0:9:57,5 --> 0:9:58,967
BEAT AIR FORCE, A BIG RIVAL? NEW


324
0:9:58,967 --> 0:9:59,967
SPEAKER: IT WAS A HUGE


325
0:9:59,967 --> 0:10:1,367
CONFIDENCE BOOST JUST BECAUSE


326
0:10:1,367 --> 0:10:2,7
AIR FORCE BEAT US LAST YEAR IN


327
0:10:2,7 --> 0:10:4,467
THE PLAYOFFS AND THEN THEY EVEN


328
0:10:4,467 --> 0:10:6,0
WENT ON TO THE REGIONALS, SO


329
0:10:6,0 --> 0:10:7,467
THEY'RE ALWAYS A TEAM THAT'S


330
0:10:7,467 --> 0:10:8,367
GOING TO BE AT THE TOP OF THE


331
0:10:8,367 --> 0:10:9,467
LEAGUE AND UNTIL WE GET TO THE


332
0:10:9,467 --> 0:10:10,7
REGIONALS, THAT'S THE TEAM WE


333
0:10:10,7 --> 0:10:11,6
HAVE TO GO THROUGH. NEW SPEAKER:


334
0:10:11,6 --> 0:10:12,767
IT WAS A BIG WIN FOR US. WE WERE


335
0:10:12,767 --> 0:10:14,7
IN A LITTLE BIT OF A RUT THERE


336
0:10:14,7 --> 0:10:16,367
AND TWO BIG WINS, WE'VE HAD TWO


337
0:10:16,367 --> 0:10:18,133
GOOD WEEKENDS IN A ROW AND


338
0:10:18,133 --> 0:10:19,467
HOPEFULLY WE CAN MOVE ON FROM


339
0:10:19,467 --> 0:10:21,5
THERE. HILL: HOW MUCH OF A


340
0:10:21,5 --> 0:10:22,233
WEIGHT IS OFF OF YOUR SHOULDERS


341
0:10:22,233 --> 0:10:23,33
NOW THAT YOU'RE BACK ON THE ICE?


342
0:10:23,33 --> 0:10:23,933
MADOLORA: A HUGE WEIGHT! BECAUSE


343
0:10:23,933 --> 0:10:25,5
TO START OFF I WAS DOWN ON


344
0:10:25,5 --> 0:10:28,967
MYSELF JUST BECAUSE I WAS


345
0:10:28,967 --> 0:10:30,267
SUSPENDED, I DIDN'T KNOW WHY, I


346
0:10:30,267 --> 0:10:31,1
DIDN'T KNOW HOW LONG AND JUST


347
0:10:31,1 --> 0:10:32,233
ALL THE UNKNOWNS ARE JUST


348
0:10:32,233 --> 0:10:34,3
DIFFICULT AND FRUSTRATING AND


349
0:10:34,3 --> 0:10:36,633
NOW THAT I'M BACK IT FEELS LIKE


350
0:10:36,633 --> 0:10:37,567
A WEIGHT'S BEEN LIFTED OFF MY


351
0:10:37,567 --> 0:10:38,567
SHOULDERS AND I CAN JUST FOCUS


352
0:10:38,567 --> 0:10:39,467
ON PLAYING AND THE REST OF THE


353
0:10:39,467 --> 0:10:46,333
YEAR AND THE REST OF THE SCHOOL


354
0:10:46,333 --> 0:10:47,267
YEAR TOO. DITULLIO: AHEAD ON

INSPIRING COUNTLESS INDIVIDUALS.


360
0:11:14,167 --> 0:11:15,2

361
0:11:15,2 --> 0:11:17,2
FIRST DEAF WRESTLER TO WIN A

MARTIAL ARTS. THROUGH THE YEARS,


367
0:11:24,733 --> 0:11:26,167
HAMILL'S BEEN AN INSPIRATION TO


368
0:11:26,167 --> 0:11:28,367
MANY, BY OVERCOMING ADVERSITY TO


369
0:11:28,367 --> 0:11:30,6
MAKE HIS DREAMS COME TRUE. NOW,


370
0:11:30,6 --> 0:11:32,133
AFTER YEARS OF PRODUCTION, HIS


371
0:11:32,133 --> 0:11:33,8

CAME TO RIT TO FEATURE ONE OF


378
0:11:55,9 --> 0:11:57,233
OUR OWN. NEW SPEAKER: HE WAS


379
0:11:57,233 --> 0:11:59,267
ALWAYS THE CENTER OF ATTENTION


380
0:11:59,267 --> 0:12:1,833
WHEREVER WE WENT, WHEREVER WE


381
0:12:1,833 --> 0:12:2,8
TRAVELED, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE, YOU


382
0:12:2,8 --> 0:12:3,833
COULD ALWAYS HEAR THEM WHISPER


383
0:12:3,833 --> 0:12:6,267
UNDER THEIR BREATH, "OH, THAT'S


384
0:12:6,267 --> 0:12:7,533

386
0:12:8,933 --> 0:12:11,3
A FORMER RIT NTID STUDENT AND


387
0:12:11,3 --> 0:12:12,867
THREE TIME DIVISION THREE


388
0:12:12,867 --> 0:12:14,567
WRESTLING CHAMPION FIRST CAUGHT


389
0:12:14,567 --> 0:12:15,633
HOLLYWOOD PRODUCER'S ATTENTION


390
0:12:15,633 --> 0:12:17,6
WHEN HE BECAME A CONTESTANT ON


391
0:12:17,6 --> 0:12:19,367
THE ULTIMATE FIGHTER REALITY


392
0:12:19,367 --> 0:12:22,3
SHOW. NEW SPEAKER: MY WRITING


393
0:12:22,3 --> 0:12:23,433
PARTNER, EBAN CASPAR, SAW IT ON


394
0:12:23,433 --> 0:12:24,867
THE UFC REALITY SHOW A FEW YEARS


395
0:12:24,867 --> 0:12:27,667
BACK, AND THOUGHT MATT WAS AN


396
0:12:27,667 --> 0:12:30,967
INSPIRING GUY HIMSELF AND WE


397
0:12:30,967 --> 0:12:32,8
LOOKED INTO IT, WE TRACKED HIM


398
0:12:32,8 --> 0:12:34,267
DOWN, MET HIM, INTERVIEWED HIM,


399
0:12:34,267 --> 0:12:36,433
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA


400
0:12:36,433 --> 0:12:38,367
FOR A SCRIPT AND WROTE THE


401
0:12:38,367 --> 0:12:39,867
SCRIPT. I THINK THE WRITING


402
0:12:39,867 --> 0:12:41,933
PROCESS WAS DIFFICULT IN THE


403
0:12:41,933 --> 0:12:45,4
BEGINNING BECAUSE TO TRY TO


404
0:12:45,4 --> 0:12:46,733
EXPLAIN TO SOMEONE, WE'RE GOING


405
0:12:46,733 --> 0:12:48,2
TO WRITE YOUR LIFE STORY BUT


406
0:12:48,2 --> 0:12:49,433
WE'RE GOING TO JUST FIT IT INTO


407
0:12:49,433 --> 0:12:51,8

YOUR DAD AND YOUR GRANDFATHER

0:12:54,367 --> 0:12:56,67
INTO ONE CHARACTER. HILL: NOT


412
0:12:56,67 --> 0:12:57,467
ONLY IS HIS STORY UNIQUE, THE


413
0:12:57,467 --> 0:13:2,233
FINAL RESULT IS THE FIRST OF ITS


414
0:13:2,233 --> 0:13:2,933
KIND. NEW SPEAKER: ONE OF THE


415
0:13:2,933 --> 0:13:4,0
REALLY COOL THINGS I THINK THAT

EVERYBODY'S BEEN INVOLVED WITH


460
0:14:12,533 --> 0:14:13,9
IT, ESPECIALLY I MYSELF WAS VERY


461
0:14:13,9 --> 0:14:15,1
LATE IN THE PROCESS, BUT IT'S


462
0:14:15,1 --> 0:14:16,7
BEEN PHENOMENAL TO SEE THAT


463
0:14:16,7 --> 0:14:17,733
EVERYBODY ELSE IS COMING OUT AND


464
0:14:17,733 --> 0:14:19,567
SUPPORTING IT AND THE VAST


465
0:14:19,567 --> 0:14:21,1
MAJORITY OF THOSE AWARDS CAME


466
0:14:21,1 --> 0:14:22,867
NOT FROM CRITICS, BUT THEY CAME


467
0:14:22,867 --> 0:14:25,333
FROM THE AUDIENCE MEMBERS

IT'S SO WEIRD, IT'S REALLY


476
0:14:45,3 --> 0:14:47,267
WEIRD, BECAUSE IT WAS A STRANGE


477
0:14:47,267 --> 0:14:49,8
THING TO ME. I THINK IT'S BEST


478
0:14:49,8 --> 0:14:51,8

"THE HAMMER", IT TOOK US SIX


481
0:14:56,133 --> 0:14:57,933
YEARS FOR THIS PROJECT. I


482
0:14:57,933 --> 0:15:0,4
THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, IT WON'T BE


483
0:15:0,4 --> 0:15:1,467
REALLY SPECIAL OR ELSE I THOUGHT


484
0:15:1,467 --> 0:15:3,233
IT WOULD BE REAL SHORT


485
0:15:3,233 --> 0:15:5,33
(INAUDIBLE).I REALIZED THAT THE


486
0:15:5,33 --> 0:15:6,333
MOVIE PRODUCERS DID NOT GIVE UP,


487
0:15:6,333 --> 0:15:8,567
BUT OVERALL, YOU KNOW, WOW! IT'S


488
0:15:8,567 --> 0:15:11,933
VERY SPECIAL. IT'S A SPECIAL


489
0:15:11,933 --> 0:15:13,833
MOMENT YOU KNOW, TO HAVE


490
0:15:13,833 --> 0:15:15,9
SOMETHING YOU KNOW, ABOUT MY


491
0:15:15,9 --> 0:15:18,33
LIFE SHOWN ROUND THE WORLD. IT'S


492
0:15:18,33 --> 0:15:19,467
REALLY AMAZING. HILL: HAMILL'S


493
0:15:19,467 --> 0:15:21,33

494
0:15:21,33 --> 0:15:22,8
INSPIRATION TO BOTH THE DEAF AND

0:15:22,8 --> 0:15:23,767

ENJOY THE FILM AND FEEL GOOD


498
0:15:26,133 --> 0:15:27,367
ABOUT IT. OBVIOUSLY THE MESSAGE


499
0:15:27,367 --> 0:15:28,5
IS ABOUT OVERCOMING STRUGGLES AT


500
0:15:28,5 --> 0:15:30,767

633
0:19:49,8 --> 0:19:51,567
THE AMERICAN WAY, BUT WE LIKE TO


634
0:19:51,567 --> 0:19:53,133
PLAY SOCCER AND WE BEAT TEAMS BY


635
0:19:53,133 --> 0:19:54,333
WEARING THEM OUT WITH OUR


636
0:19:54,333 --> 0:19:57,0
