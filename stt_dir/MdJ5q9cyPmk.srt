1
0:0:57,44 --> 0:1:0,15
5... 4... 3..


2
0:1:0,15 --> 0:1:58,6
2... 1... Hup!


3
0:1:58,6 --> 0:2:6,53
Come on...


4
0:2:6,53 --> 0:2:9,26
Here you go...


5
0:2:9,26 --> 0:2:37,13
come on... come on...


6
0:2:37,13 --> 0:2:41,13
When I was down the pit
and I got my children


7
0:2:41,13 --> 0:2:43,96
She said, get a hobby.


8
0:2:43,96 --> 0:2:47,86
So I got the pigeons.


9
0:2:47,86 --> 0:2:53,86
I think then, pitmen were slaves.


10
0:2:53,86 --> 0:2:57,6
It was very rare they saw the daylight.


11
0:2:57,6 --> 0:3:2,53
you could be on the first shift...
4 o'clock in the morning


12
0:3:2,53 --> 0:3:7,33
until dinner time, then you went to bed,
got up and it was dark.


13
0:3:7,33 --> 0:3:13,13
It was very rare you saw the sunlight.


14
0:3:13,13 --> 0:3:16,8
when you were down the pit.
They gave you something to...


15
0:3:16,8 --> 0:3:21,73
fresh air and plenty of exercise and that.


16
0:3:21,73 --> 0:3:24,66
Looking after them


17
0:3:24,66 --> 0:3:29,33
and you always got the sun


18
0:3:29,33 --> 0:3:30,73
It's a good hobby


19
0:3:30,73 --> 0:3:34,26
Still is!


20
0:3:34,26 --> 0:3:38,93
but... it's dying out now.


21
0:3:38,93 --> 0:3:45,56
It's a dying sport.


22
0:3:45,56 --> 0:3:52,66
- Another one for stan!...
- Stan's getting one...


23
0:3:52,66 --> 0:3:54,13
What's that stan?


24
0:3:54,13 --> 0:3:57,73
- Ordinary?
- Ordinary.


25
0:3:57,73 --> 0:4:0,86
No money on it.


26
0:4:0,86 --> 0:4:2,6
All the pigeons that go away


27
0:4:2,6 --> 0:4:4,8
this week, cost Â£1.80


28
0:4:4,8 --> 0:4:6,93
Just to go, with no money on


29
0:4:6,93 --> 0:4:9,53
But you win the prize money out of that side


30
0:4:9,53 --> 0:4:12,6
So if you fancy it to win


31
0:4:12,6 --> 0:4:15,6
You can put 50p on it,
you can put a pound on!


32
0:4:15,6 --> 0:4:19,13
There might be about forty or fifty 50pences


33
0:4:19,13 --> 0:4:22,3
and there might be 20 or 30
pool to the pound


34
0:4:22,3 --> 0:4:26,46
well, the first on of them, gets that money.


35
0:4:26,46 --> 0:4:31,73
Wow!


36
0:4:31,73 --> 0:4:34,4
Maurice... he's a good lad.


37
0:4:34,4 --> 0:4:37,6
He's a good mate


38
0:4:37,6 --> 0:4:39,86
And you always get a good laugh


39
0:4:39,86 --> 0:4:42,6
He says things that make you laugh


40
0:4:42,6 --> 0:4:45,0
things like that.


41
0:4:45,0 --> 0:4:48,33
We've been close friends for years.


42
0:4:48,33 --> 0:4:49,86
But say we try and..


43
0:4:49,86 --> 0:4:51,4
competition wise...


44
0:4:51,4 --> 0:4:54,93
beat each other.


45
0:4:54,93 --> 0:4:57,86
If he beats you, you just try again.


46
0:4:57,86 --> 0:5:0,73
and if I beat him, he trys again


47
0:5:0,73 --> 0:5:2,0
I mean...


48
0:5:2,0 --> 0:5:4,6
There's opposition every bloody week


49
0:5:4,6 --> 0:5:5,73
isn't there, jack.


50
0:5:5,73 --> 0:5:9,26
I mean, if jack wins
i'm over the bloody moon.


51
0:5:9,26 --> 0:5:18,82
why i say that but
I don't really believe it.


52
0:5:18,82 --> 0:5:27,46
come on get out, settle down.


53
0:5:27,46 --> 0:5:30,86
You can win as many of these short races
as you like


54
0:5:30,86 --> 0:5:34,6
I mean, i've won the short race Selby


55
0:5:34,6 --> 0:5:37,26
oh, I couldn't tell you how many times.


56
0:5:37,26 --> 0:5:40,86
but if you win the big race
and you top the combine


57
0:5:40,86 --> 0:5:42,46
your name's made.


58
0:5:42,46 --> 0:5:46,33
The classic race is Bourges


59
0:5:46,33 --> 0:5:49,6
560 miles


60
0:5:49,6 --> 0:5:52,46
now they're pigeons.


61
0:5:52,46 --> 0:5:57,2
It's the one race i'd like to win again.


62
0:5:57,2 --> 0:6:1,33
My first race was 1949


63
0:6:1,33 --> 0:6:5,26
I came out of the army in 1955


64
0:6:5,26 --> 0:6:9,4
and we started to build this
old pigeon cree.


65
0:6:9,4 --> 0:6:13,53
the wood was only old wood
from colliery houses


66
0:6:13,53 --> 0:6:16,6
that they were pulling down


67
0:6:16,6 --> 0:6:17,93
from the pit.


68
0:6:17,93 --> 0:6:19,53
But 10 years back


69
0:6:19,53 --> 0:6:22,53
when this local developer


70
0:6:22,53 --> 0:6:23,73
wanted the land


71
0:6:23,73 --> 0:6:26,53
they decided that they would get


72
0:6:26,53 --> 0:6:28,66
the pigeon cree listed.


73
0:6:28,66 --> 0:6:30,8
Made a listed building.


74
0:6:30,8 --> 0:6:32,86
Then he started again,


75
0:6:32,86 --> 0:6:38,26
he wanted the gardens back
for a development.


76
0:6:38,26 --> 0:6:39,26
(The Sound of ITV News)


77
0:6:39,26 --> 0:6:42,86
The culture secretary has
pledged his support


78
0:6:42,86 --> 0:6:45,8
his support to save the world's
only listed pigeon cree


79
0:6:45,8 --> 0:6:47,66
and the allotments it stand on.


80
0:6:47,66 --> 0:6:51,33
It's hoped the minister's visit today
will ruffle a few feathers


81
0:6:51,33 --> 0:6:54,93
and help the allotment holders win
their long running battle


82
0:6:54,93 --> 0:6:57,6
to save the gardens of Ryhope.


83
0:6:57,6 --> 0:6:59,4
A Newcastle based development company


84
0:6:59,4 --> 0:7:1,73
owns the land and wants to
build houses there.


85
0:7:1,73 --> 0:7:5,6
Maurice, who's 75 and recently
suffered a heart attack


86
0:7:5,6 --> 0:7:8,4
says he won't give up his
campaign to save his cree


87
0:7:8,4 --> 0:7:9,53
and the allotments.


88
0:7:9,53 --> 0:7:12,66
Give up and walk away? No, Never.


89
0:7:12,66 --> 0:7:15,26
No, i'd rather drop dead in the
garden than do that!


90
0:7:15,26 --> 0:7:19,13
Lesley McNeish ITV Tyne Tees, Sunderland.


91
0:7:19,13 --> 0:7:22,93
(Maurice): It's been well publicised on the
television and all over.


92
0:7:22,93 --> 0:7:24,46
It'll always be here


93
0:7:24,46 --> 0:7:26,8
as long as it's in good condition
they cannot pull it down.


94
0:7:26,8 --> 0:7:28,13
The developer cannot knock it down.


95
0:7:28,13 --> 0:7:31,6
He might... if the worst comes to the worst


96
0:7:31,6 --> 0:7:34,26
which we hope never happens mind,


97
0:7:34,26 --> 0:7:37,2
this'll be left standing


98
0:7:37,2 --> 0:7:41,33
and maybe the other gardens
will be taken off the lads.


99
0:7:41,33 --> 0:7:43,46
It'll be a sad day


100
0:7:43,46 --> 0:7:45,46
a very, very, very sad day


101
0:7:45,46 --> 0:7:47,33
I'll tell the truth for that


102
0:7:47,33 --> 0:7:50,86
I cannot race my pigeons if
i'm on here by myself.


103
0:7:50,86 --> 0:7:53,6
and they're building round us.


104
0:7:53,6 --> 0:8:3,4
see, you cannot race pigeons that way.


105
0:8:3,4 --> 0:8:7,96
Now, I've brought it up and put it inside,


106
0:8:7,96 --> 0:8:12,73
and I've given it a sesqui tablet


107
0:8:12,73 --> 0:8:16,16
and it's had a bite... and i've
given it a drink of water


108
0:8:16,16 --> 0:8:20,11
and I'll leave it there and I'll contact you


109
0:8:20,11 --> 0:8:24,66
and let you know if it's coming on alright.


110
0:8:24,66 --> 0:8:29,0
Ok?


111
0:8:29,0 --> 0:8:32,56
This is the one i've just been
on to the chap about


112
0:8:32,56 --> 0:8:36,43
it's the worst i've ever seen a pigeon


113
0:8:36,43 --> 0:8:38,8
If you feel there


114
0:8:38,8 --> 0:8:43,46
- oh.. dear me.
- So, what's your opinion?


115
0:8:43,46 --> 0:8:47,63
- This old lady brought it to my house.
- poor little bugger.


116
0:8:47,63 --> 0:8:51,73
Has it been shot like? oh here, Jack.


117
0:8:51,73 --> 0:8:58,2
No, the cat's had it.


118
0:8:58,2 --> 0:9:1,43
- But if you look at it's eye...
- it's a lovely eye on it mind.


119
0:9:1,43 --> 0:9:4,63
- There's a bit of life in it.
- oh aye, definitely.. lovely eye on it.


120
0:9:4,63 --> 0:9:11,86
...a little sparkle of life.


121
0:9:11,86 --> 0:9:29,33
Put him in intensive care!


122
0:9:29,33 --> 0:9:32,7
Well it was a disaster last week.


123
0:9:32,7 --> 0:9:36,78
We lost all our best pigeons.


124
0:9:36,78 --> 0:9:40,83
Two combines was at Clermont


125
0:9:40,83 --> 0:9:45,8
and they clashed


126
0:9:45,8 --> 0:9:49,66
She was my main bird


127
0:9:49,66 --> 0:9:53,23
I had her pooled up to win the race.


128
0:9:53,23 --> 0:9:57,93
But she was reported in Surrey.


129
0:9:57,93 --> 0:10:2,3
This is the one I was going
to send to Bourges...


130
0:10:2,3 --> 0:10:4,28
the big classic race.


131
0:10:4,28 --> 0:10:7,17
But I can't send her now.


132
0:10:7,17 --> 0:10:12,13
Because, she's too tired.


133
0:10:12,13 --> 0:10:14,76
But, I'm going to send one


134
0:10:14,76 --> 0:10:18,46
in it's place.


135
0:10:18,46 --> 0:10:24,2
now this one has already scored this year.


136
0:10:24,2 --> 0:10:32,2
So I'm going to send that in it's place.


137
0:10:32,2 --> 0:10:33,8
You wanna go this week?


138
0:10:33,8 --> 0:10:35,1
all shaking their heads...


139
0:10:35,1 --> 0:10:37,31
don't want to go.


140
0:10:37,31 --> 0:10:43,8
But they're going!


141
0:10:43,8 --> 0:10:45,23
He's big and bonnie


142
0:10:45,23 --> 0:10:54,4
Beautiful.


143
0:10:54,4 --> 0:10:57,73
This bad bugger's fat and all.


144
0:10:57,73 --> 0:11:0,6
But she always comes home.


145
0:11:0,6 --> 0:11:4,2
Oh, she's bonnie though.


146
0:11:4,2 --> 0:11:6,8
As I say, I cannot get them any better.


147
0:11:6,8 --> 0:11:9,2
It's up to them now.


148
0:11:9,2 --> 0:11:11,26
You've got to build them up for this race.


149
0:11:11,26 --> 0:11:15,43
I mean, if it's a fast day it won't
take so much out of them


150
0:11:15,43 --> 0:11:16,8
not so much weight.


151
0:11:16,8 --> 0:11:21,76
But they've still got to fly 565 miles.


152
0:11:21,76 --> 0:11:24,93
see... I'm happy with them though.


153
0:11:24,93 --> 0:11:26,9
I wouldn't be sending them
if I didn't fancy them.


154
0:11:26,9 --> 0:11:29,6
I wouldn't be sending them.


155
0:11:29,6 --> 0:11:34,73
That's the hand book we get every year.


156
0:11:34,73 --> 0:11:40,13
As they come back to my loft,
the positions are there.


157
0:11:40,13 --> 0:11:45,5
I write the remarks on the bottom...
"Came Canny"


158
0:11:45,5 --> 0:11:47,13
So I was pleased.


159
0:11:47,13 --> 0:11:49,16
Now what i've got bottom there...


160
0:11:49,16 --> 0:11:51,21
"Came Crap"


161
0:11:51,21 --> 0:11:53,26
No swearing.


162
0:11:53,26 --> 0:11:56,1
I got the wooden spoon, I was last.


163
0:11:56,1 --> 0:11:59,13
That's for this week.


164
0:11:59,13 --> 0:12:8,38
All I want's a bit of luck.


165
0:12:8,38 --> 0:12:12,4
- You only got one?
- You only got three?


166
0:12:12,4 --> 0:12:14,31
All the pigeons you've got and
you're only sending one?


167
0:12:14,31 --> 0:12:15,57
Aye.


168
0:12:15,57 --> 0:12:19,13
(in the distance)
Jackie! It only takes one to win.


169
0:12:19,13 --> 0:12:37,33
He's right, it only takes one to win.


170
0:12:37,33 --> 0:12:41,66
Checked Cock.


171
0:12:41,66 --> 0:12:45,53
Come on bonnie lass... get in.


172
0:12:45,53 --> 0:12:49,7
(Singing)
There's a place...


173
0:12:49,7 --> 0:12:52,8
...for us...


174
0:12:52,8 --> 0:13:13,53
That's it then.


175
0:13:13,53 --> 0:13:17,46
Over the water, they all tuck into it.


176
0:13:17,46 --> 0:13:22,81
That's Scotland, Yorkshire..


177
0:13:22,81 --> 0:13:24,75
and it's all worked out


178
0:13:24,75 --> 0:13:48,33
that the best bird wins.


179
0:13:48,33 --> 0:13:52,1
They'll probably be all liberated


180
0:13:52,1 --> 0:13:56,7
on the Friday morning.


181
0:13:56,7 --> 0:13:59,26
They'll circle


182
0:13:59,26 --> 0:14:2,53
then they'll all go away.


183
0:14:2,53 --> 0:14:6,9
And as they're on the road home,


184
0:14:6,9 --> 0:14:8,88
they start to think


185
0:14:8,88 --> 0:14:10,83
and the good ones


186
0:14:10,83 --> 0:14:13,86
splits away.


187
0:14:13,86 --> 0:14:15,9
That's how you get your winners.


188
0:14:15,9 --> 0:14:18,53
My opinion


189
0:14:18,53 --> 0:14:37,73
it's a highly developed instinct.


190
0:14:37,73 --> 0:14:42,1
But they're a marvelous animal, them.


191
0:14:42,1 --> 0:15:13,6
Truly wonderful.


192
0:15:13,6 --> 0:15:19,13
(Maurice) I think Jack, why we've been
mates all our lives.


193
0:15:19,13 --> 0:15:25,13
It must have been 1952 when
Jackie came here.


194
0:15:25,13 --> 0:15:31,16
As I say, me and Jackie,
we've been here the longest


195
0:15:31,16 --> 0:15:33,96
and I think we'll be the last to leave too.


196
0:15:33,96 --> 0:15:36,13
that's a certainty.


197
0:15:36,13 --> 0:15:37,8
(Jackie) Oh! she's out!


198
0:15:37,8 --> 0:15:39,26
I'd be lost without him


199
0:15:39,26 --> 0:15:41,1
and he'd be lost without me.


200
0:15:41,1 --> 0:15:45,0
So he says like.


201
0:15:45,0 --> 0:15:48,33
Jackie's in poor health and all.


202
0:15:48,33 --> 0:15:50,46
He got his lung taken out,


203
0:15:50,46 --> 0:15:55,16
he worked in the pit and he
contracted cancer in the lung.


204
0:15:55,16 --> 0:16:0,11
we were all worried over him.


205
0:16:0,11 --> 0:16:3,97
I said, how long have I got?


206
0:16:3,97 --> 0:16:8,9
you know? I said, tell us!


207
0:16:8,9 --> 0:16:14,5
he says: Well, 3 to 6 months.


208
0:16:14,5 --> 0:16:18,0
I thought, good god.


209
0:16:18,0 --> 0:16:24,5
I come out with the lads and
I said, it'll not beat me.


210
0:16:24,5 --> 0:16:27,33
I was doing my exercises and that.


211
0:16:27,33 --> 0:16:30,36
Over there they're some steps,
have you seen them?


212
0:16:30,36 --> 0:16:32,91
About sixty odd steps.


213
0:16:32,91 --> 0:16:35,4
Off the football field.


214
0:16:35,4 --> 0:16:39,43
I used to run up there as fast as I could


215
0:16:39,43 --> 0:16:43,4
and I was fifty, you know what I mean?


216
0:16:43,4 --> 0:16:46,43
Please yourself whether you believe
it or not, I don't care,


217
0:16:46,43 --> 0:16:48,46
that's what happened.


218
0:16:48,46 --> 0:16:53,49
So, I had to go back to the doctors


219
0:16:53,49 --> 0:16:58,7
and he got the x-rays and they looked
up and they looked at me


220
0:16:58,7 --> 0:17:6,16
and the doctor said, are you sure
you're John Surtees born...


221
0:17:6,16 --> 0:17:8,53
I said, aye I'm sure.


222
0:17:8,53 --> 0:17:13,43
he said, well your lung has not collapsed,


223
0:17:13,43 --> 0:17:15,2
it's working alright.


224
0:17:15,2 --> 0:17:21,23
And it's moved away from your heart,
the growth.


225
0:17:21,23 --> 0:17:26,92
And I was in and operated on


226
0:17:26,92 --> 0:17:31,33
two days after.


227
0:17:31,33 --> 0:17:35,0
And that's what happened there.


228
0:17:35,0 --> 0:17:39,86
And I've been alive since!


229
0:17:39,86 --> 0:17:44,63
He's pulled round and I think coming
round the garden every day


230
0:17:44,63 --> 0:17:47,83
and having his pigeons, his good hobby...


231
0:17:47,83 --> 0:17:51,25
that's what's pulled him round.


232
0:17:51,25 --> 0:17:54,63
They kept us alive, the pigeons.


233
0:17:54,63 --> 0:17:57,4
Kept us alive that.


234
0:17:57,4 --> 0:18:12,86
Something to look forward to all the time.


235
0:18:12,86 --> 0:18:19,5
So you can image if it happens
where we get it taken off us.


236
0:18:19,5 --> 0:18:34,46
What would we do?


237
0:18:34,46 --> 0:18:40,86
That's a third prize..


238
0:18:40,86 --> 0:18:46,2
that's a second..


239
0:18:46,2 --> 0:18:49,6
that's a sixth..


240
0:18:49,6 --> 0:18:53,0
ah, I've got a first.


241
0:18:53,0 --> 0:19:4,53
That's a first prize card


242
0:19:4,53 --> 0:19:8,73
I'm getting there...


243
0:19:8,73 --> 0:19:10,86
It's ringing now...


244
0:19:10,86 --> 0:19:13,53
(telephone) It's Saturday the
21st of June the time's 12:00


245
0:19:13,53 --> 0:19:16,13
right, the convoy has been on
to me from Bourges


246
0:19:16,13 --> 0:19:23,66
and he is going to liverate the
Bourges pigeons at 1:00


247
0:19:23,66 --> 0:19:26,93
There's not many young lads coming
into the sport now...


248
0:19:26,93 --> 0:19:29,6
ah, there's no young lads in Ryhope.


249
0:19:29,6 --> 0:19:33,43
To get the bairns interested,
I wish we could!


250
0:19:33,43 --> 0:19:37,2
We've got the school interested
in the gardens


251
0:19:37,2 --> 0:19:43,3
we've got the headteacher, she going
to fetch a few bairns up.


252
0:19:43,3 --> 0:19:45,1
Over the moon aren't they.


253
0:19:45,1 --> 0:19:46,2
Over the moon!


254
0:19:46,2 --> 0:19:48,0
- Which one to get out to show you?
- That one!


255
0:19:48,0 --> 0:19:53,91
- Which one?
- The white one! The white one!


256
0:19:53,91 --> 0:19:57,76
Just stroke it, there we are,
touch it's head.


257
0:19:57,76 --> 0:20:0,33
It won't hurt you.


258
0:20:0,33 --> 0:20:5,2
I think I'd like to get them coming
round the garden regular.


259
0:20:5,2 --> 0:20:10,3
Get them to pick a few pigeons they like
and come round every day


260
0:20:10,3 --> 0:20:15,0
to feed them and fly them


261
0:20:15,0 --> 0:20:17,23
and maybe we can entice them to say,


262
0:20:17,23 --> 0:20:20,23
I fancy them to go for a race this week.


263
0:20:20,23 --> 0:20:22,8
Aye, then they might get into it.


264
0:20:22,8 --> 0:20:29,93
But, as far as the pigeons are concerned,
I wish we had a few more youngsters in.


265
0:20:29,93 --> 0:20:33,44
Today, I think they might fly about,
what? 8 hours Jack?


266
0:20:33,44 --> 0:20:34,99
Aye.


267
0:20:34,99 --> 0:20:39,33
If it's good weather, which it is.


268
0:20:39,33 --> 0:20:42,6
The first 8 hours will be good weather.


269
0:20:42,6 --> 0:20:44,8
then there'll be 4 hours tomorrow
in England.


270
0:20:44,8 --> 0:20:49,86
- The good ones will be in 11:30.
- Aye, about that tomorrow.


271
0:20:49,86 --> 0:20:52,93
That's the good ones.


272
0:20:52,93 --> 0:21:0,6
The one's that are carrying the luck.


273
0:21:0,6 --> 0:21:6,63
See his, will land on a milk man's house,
where they get up early!


274
0:21:6,63 --> 0:21:19,4
Mine will land in the fields,
miles from anywhere!


275
0:21:19,4 --> 0:21:21,13
Get ready!


276
0:21:21,13 --> 0:21:27,46
Alright!


277
0:21:27,46 --> 0:23:57,93
Pull!


278
0:23:57,93 --> 0:24:5,3
We had word that the bulldozers,
the bailifs were coming in.


279
0:24:5,3 --> 0:24:7,13
But nobody turned up.


280
0:24:7,13 --> 0:24:12,1
If they want us off here, well they'll have
to carry us off bodily.


281
0:24:12,1 --> 0:24:15,65
And I've got a big family.


282
0:24:15,65 --> 0:24:19,0
It'll be like declaring war.


283
0:24:19,0 --> 0:24:22,4
And we're not being awkward,
this is our way of life...


284
0:24:22,4 --> 0:24:24,92
and this is the way we want
to end our lives.


285
0:24:24,92 --> 0:24:41,4
and that's all there is to it.


286
0:24:41,4 --> 0:25:0,66
Oh look out, it's mine!


287
0:25:0,66 --> 0:25:4,3
So that's him.. I'm over the moon!


288
0:25:4,3 --> 0:25:5,86
Over the moon!


289
0:25:5,86 --> 0:25:9,23
First time across the channel.


290
0:25:9,23 --> 0:25:13,53
Maurice!


291
0:25:13,53 --> 0:25:17,13
- We're still waiting.
- I'm getting one!


292
0:25:17,13 --> 0:25:19,2
- Have you?
- Aye!


293
0:25:19,2 --> 0:25:21,5
I could be third.


294
0:25:21,5 --> 0:25:35,7
They always turn up.


295
0:25:35,7 --> 0:25:59,89
- Who's this?
- Jackie Surtees.


296
0:25:59,89 --> 0:26:7,3
Waiting, wait, wait, wait...


297
0:26:7,3 --> 0:26:10,84
Well, I've done very well.


298
0:26:10,84 --> 0:26:13,6
I'm getting third position


299
0:26:13,6 --> 0:26:15,5
and I'll get some money and that.


300
0:26:15,5 --> 0:26:20,13
So I'm really... happy!


301
0:26:20,13 --> 0:26:23,3
Ah, you've got to take the
good with the bad.


302
0:26:23,3 --> 0:26:28,73
I think, you've got more bad luck
than good luck.


303
0:26:28,73 --> 0:26:31,8
I'm not carrying the luck, that's all.


304
0:26:31,8 --> 0:26:39,3
But, they'll come back.. I think..
they'll come back.


305
0:26:39,3 --> 0:28:39,3
That's all there is to it.
