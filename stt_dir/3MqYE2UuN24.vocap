###0 On those cold, rainy days when you forget your rain jacket or umbrella and you want
###3 to stay as dry as possibleâ€¦ should you walk and spend more time in the rain? Or should
###7 you run, which means you'll be smashing into more raindrops from the side?
###11 Assuming you haven't been fully soaked yet and you aren't jumping into puddles, the answer
###14 is simple. As you move out of the way of one falling raindrop, you move into the way of
###18 another. So the amount of rain hitting the top of you is constant, regardless of how
###22 fast you're going. Alternatively, you can picture that the raindrops themselves are
###25 stationary and you (and the earth beneath you) are moving upwards through the rain!
###28 And since the volume of a parallelepiped (that's a 3D parallelogram) doesn't depend at all
###32 on its slant, then no matter how fast you're moving horizontally the same amount of rain
###36 will land on top of you each second.
###38 Now, if you're not moving, the rain from the top is all you'll get. But if you ARE moving,
###42 you'll also run into raindrops from the side and you'll get wetter. So in any given second,
###46 you stay driest by standing still, and the faster you move the wetter you become.
###50 But if you're trying to get from point A to point B, then standing still won't do you
###54 much good. And en route from point A to point B, the total amount of rain you run into from
###58 the side has nothing to do with how fast you're going - just like how a snowplow will plow
###62 the same amount of snow from a stretch of road regardless of the exact speed it drives.
###67 In the case of running through the rain, you can figure that out using parallelepipeds
###70 again.
###71 So over a given period of time, the same amount of rain will hit you from the top, regardless
###74 of how fast you're going. And over a given distance, you'll hit the same amount of rain
###78 from the side - again, regardless of how fast you're going.
###80 So your total wetness is equal to the wetness per second for rain from the top times the
###84 amount of time you spend in the rain, plus the wetness per meter for rain from the side
###88 times the number of meters you travel.
###90 So to stay driest getting from one point to another, you should try to minimize the amount
###93 of water falling onto you from above. And quite simply, that means getting out of the
###97 rain as fast as possible.
