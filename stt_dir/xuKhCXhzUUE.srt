1
0:0:0,25 --> 0:0:2,98
PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU BRING A CONE FROM


2
0:0:2,98 --> 0:0:7,48
GYMNOSPERM IN FOR THIS WEEK'S LAB. IT IS IMPORTANT.


3
0:0:7,48 --> 0:0:10,19
AND SOME OF YOU WON'T COLLECT THE GYMNOSPERM'S
CONE,


4
0:0:10,19 --> 0:0:12,3
BUT THAT IS OKAY. YOU ARE THINKING AND THAT
IS THE


5
0:0:12,3 --> 0:0:14,44
MAIN POINT OF THE EXERCISE, IS TO GET THIS
CONE


6
0:0:14,44 --> 0:0:16,359
BROUGHT INTO THE LAB.


7
0:0:16,359 --> 0:0:18,39
TODAY'S LECTURE, WHAT I WANT TO DO IS TO


8
0:0:18,39 --> 0:0:22,81
CONTINUE TO EXPLORE THE PRIMARY PLANT BODY
AND TALK


9
0:0:22,81 --> 0:0:24,68
ABOUT THE CELLS AND THE TISSUES THAT MAKE
UP THE


10
0:0:24,68 --> 0:0:27,72
PRIMARY PLANT BODY. MOST OF YOU THINK, GOSH,
THIS IS


11
0:0:27,72 --> 0:0:30,49
REALLY GOING TO BE A DULL TOPIC BUT WHAT I
WANT TO SAY


12
0:0:30,49 --> 0:0:33,16
AT THE OUTSET THAT MOST OF THE THESE CELLS
AND TISSUES


13
0:0:33,16 --> 0:0:36,48
THAT WE TALK ABOUT TODAY, YOU HAVE, IF NOT
DAILY


14
0:0:36,48 --> 0:0:39,55
 CONTACT WITH MOST OF THESE YOU HAVE WEEKLY
CONTACT


15
0:0:39,55 --> 0:0:42,489
WITH MOST OF THEM. AND SO, WHAT I WOULD LIKE
TO DO IS


16
0:0:42,489 --> 0:0:44,84
SHOW YOU EXAMPLES THAT ARE RELEVANT TO YOUR
DAILY


17
0:0:44,84 --> 0:0:47,7
LIVES AND AT THE SAME TIME INTRODUCE YOU TO
THE


18
0:0:47,7 --> 0:0:50,64
DIFFERENT CELLS AND TISSUES THAT MAKE UP THE
PLANT


19
0:0:50,64 --> 0:0:56,199
BODY. NOW, AFTER THE EMBRYO FORMS THE FORMATION
OF


20
0:0:56,199 --> 0:0:59,34
NEW CELLS, AND TISSUES BECOMES RESTRICTED
TO THE


21
0:0:59,34 --> 0:1:12,159
MERISTEMS. AFTER EMBRYO FORMATION NEW CELLS
OR NEW


22
0:1:12,159 --> 0:1:18,53
CELL PRODUCTION, IS RESTRICTED MORE OR LESS
TO THE


23
0:1:18,53 --> 0:1:27,86
MERISTEMS.


24
0:1:27,86 --> 0:1:34,759
WE SAID LAST TIME THAT A MERISTEM WAS A ZONE
OF


25
0:1:34,759 --> 0:1:39,31
HIGH CELL DIVISION ACTIVITY. MERISTEMS ARE
ZONES OF


26
0:1:39,31 --> 0:1:42,84
HIGH CELL DIVISION ACTIVITY AND THAT THERE
WAS A SHOOT


27
0:1:42,84 --> 0:1:53,82
MERISTEM AND A ROOT MERISTEM.


28
0:1:53,82 --> 0:1:56,88
THESE CELLS, WHICH ARE ABLE TO DIVIDE, WHICH
WE


29
0:1:56,88 --> 0:2:2,67
SAY ARE COMPRISING THE MERISTEM, BASICALLY
WE BELIEVE


30
0:2:2,67 --> 0:2:5,89
COULD DIVIDE FOREVER. THEY, AS LONG AS THEY
ARE NOT


31
0:2:5,89 --> 0:2:11,11
DAMAGED OR INFECTED BY SOME PATHOGEN, WE THINK
THESE


32
0:2:11,11 --> 0:2:13,8
 CELLS CAN DIVIDE FOREVER. FOR THOSE OF YOU
WHO ARE


33
0:2:13,8 --> 0:2:19,989
FAMILIAR WITH THE TERM "STEM CELLS" THIS IS
STEM CELLS


34
0:2:19,989 --> 0:2:23,66
IN THE ANIMAL SENSE, STEM CELLS. MANY PEOPLE
BELIEVE


35
0:2:23,66 --> 0:2:26,58
THAT MERISTEM STEM CELLS ARE EQUIVALENT TO
ANIMAL STEM


36
0:2:26,58 --> 0:2:29,17
CELLS. THAT IS, THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO
DIVIDE


37
0:2:29,17 --> 0:2:34,65
LITERALLY FOREVER. NOW, THE ACTIVITY OF THE
MERISTEM


38
0:2:34,65 --> 0:2:49,94
YIELDS CELLS WHICH WE SAID WERE PRIMARY.


39
0:2:49,94 --> 0:2:56,79
THEY CAN TRACE THEIR ORIGIN


40
0:2:56,79 --> 0:3:0,87
TO THE MERISTEMS.


41
0:3:0,87 --> 0:3:3,7
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT, CELLS WHICH CAN


42
0:3:3,7 --> 0:3:6,349
TRACE THEIR ORIGINS TO THE MERISTEM ARE SAID
TO BE


43
0:3:6,349 --> 0:3:19,26
PRIMARY. AND, THESE CELLS TOGETHER FORM THE
PRIMARY


44
0:3:19,26 --> 0:3:19,54
PLANT BODY.


45
0:3:19,54 --> 0:3:27,519
WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE PRIMARY PLANT BODY
TODAY.


46
0:3:27,519 --> 0:3:29,849
MORE IMPORTANTLY, I WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
OF


47
0:3:29,849 --> 0:3:45,989
IT IN A MOMENT, MERISTEMS ARE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE


48
0:3:45,989 --> 0:3:57,15
CELLS WHICH YIELD ELONGATION OF THE PLANT
BODY.


49
0:3:57,15 --> 0:4:1,81
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT I MEAN
BY


50
0:4:1,81 --> 0:4:5,36
MERISTEM STEM CELLS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
CELLS THAT


51
0:4:5,36 --> 0:4:8,9
 LEAD TO THE ELONGATION OF THE PLANT BODY.


52
0:4:8,9 --> 0:4:11,62
LET'S HAVE AN AXIS HERE. WE CAN START WITH
THIS


53
0:4:11,62 --> 0:4:17,3
AXIS AND THIS WILL BE THE SHOOT APICAL MERISTEM
AT ONE


54
0:4:17,3 --> 0:4:22,49
END, AND THIS WILL BE THE ROOT APICAL MERISTEM
AT THE


55
0:4:22,49 --> 0:4:24,62
OTHER END.


56
0:4:24,62 --> 0:4:27,93
AND FOR OUR DISCUSSION TODAY LET'S JUST PUT


57
0:4:27,93 --> 0:4:31,37
A REFERENCE POINT HERE, WE WILL CALL THIS
A REFERENCE


58
0:4:31,37 --> 0:4:36,36
POINT. LET'S SAY WE PUT A MARK OF INK ON THE
PLANT OR


59
0:4:36,36 --> 0:4:39,71
TIED SOMETHING AROUND THIS PORTION OF THE
PLANT. NOW


60
0:4:39,71 --> 0:4:46,3
WE WILL WAIT FOR SOME TIME, AND NEW CELLS
ARE GOING TO


61
0:4:46,3 --> 0:4:49,74
BE PRODUCED AT THE SHOOT APICAL MERISTEM AND
THE ROOT


62
0:4:49,74 --> 0:4:53,49
APICAL MERISTEM. THIS WILL BE BY MITOSIS.
IF WE


63
0:4:53,49 --> 0:4:56,68
WAITED FOR SOME TIME WE WOULD FIND THAT THE
AXIS WAS


64
0:4:56,68 --> 0:5:1,389
NOW LONGER.


65
0:5:1,389 --> 0:5:4,72
HERE IS OUR REFERENCE POINT AGAIN, THE AXIS
IS


66
0:5:4,72 --> 0:5:7,16
STILL LONGER.


67
0:5:7,16 --> 0:5:11,91
AND IF WE WAITED FOR SOME MORE TIME, THE AXIS


68
0:5:11,91 --> 0:5:15,389
WOULD BE EVEN LONGER WITH THE SHOOT APICAL
MERISTEM


69
0:5:15,389 --> 0:5:19,8
 HERE, THE ROOT APICAL MERISTEM HERE AND
OUR REFERENCE


70
0:5:19,8 --> 0:5:23,84
POINT HERE.


71
0:5:23,84 --> 0:5:33,15
THIS IS KNOWN AS ELONGATION GROWTH.


72
0:5:33,15 --> 0:5:36,82
AND THIS ELONGATION GROWTH COMES ABOUT DUE
TO


73
0:5:36,82 --> 0:5:41,11
THE ACTIVITIES OF CELLS THAT ARE PRODUCED
BY THE


74
0:5:41,11 --> 0:5:45,31
APICAL MERISTEM AND THEN THEMSELVES ELONGATE.
SO,


75
0:5:45,31 --> 0:5:49,72
WHEN A PLANT GROWS IN LENGTH, THAT IS A RESULT
OF


76
0:5:49,72 --> 0:5:52,44
CELLS THAT HAVE BEEN PRODUCED AT THE TWO TIPS,
THE


77
0:5:52,44 --> 0:5:56,61
APICAL MERISTEM AND THOSE CELLS THEMSELVES
ELONGATE TO


78
0:5:56,61 --> 0:5:59,21
INCREASE THE LENGTH OF THE AXIS. THIS IS THE
PRIMARY


79
0:5:59,21 --> 0:6:2,33
PLANT BODY AND IT IS IMPORTANT.


80
0:6:2,33 --> 0:6:6,229
NOW, WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TO BEGIN WITH


81
0:6:6,229 --> 0:6:9,8
THE DISCUSSION OF THE VARIOUS CELL AND TISSUE
TYPES


82
0:6:9,8 --> 0:6:12,74
WHICH MAKE UP THE PRIMARY PLANT BODY. AND
FOR OUR


83
0:6:12,74 --> 0:6:22,3
DISCUSSION TODAY WE CAN DEFINE A TISSUE AS
ONE OR MORE


84
0:6:22,3 --> 0:6:41,46
CELL TYPES DISTINGUISHED STRUCTURALLY OR FUNCTIONALLY


85
0:6:41,46 --> 0:6:51,86
OR WITH BOTH CHARACTERISTICS.


86
0:6:51,86 --> 0:6:54,9
I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN OUR DISCUSSION WITH
THE


87
0:6:54,9 --> 0:7:0,229
 FIRST TISSUE TYPE; WHICH IS REALLY ONLY
A CELL.


88
0:7:0,229 --> 0:7:7,94
AND THIS TISSUE TYPE IS CALLED PARENCHYMA.


89
0:7:7,94 --> 0:7:16,8
THIS IS BELIEVED TO BE THE FIRST CELL TYPE


90
0:7:16,8 --> 0:7:21,65
EVOLVED FROM WHICH ALL OF THE OTHER PLANT
CELLS WERE


91
0:7:21,65 --> 0:7:35,979
DERIVED.


92
0:7:35,979 --> 0:7:38,12
NOW, LET'S BEGIN WITH SOME CHARACTERISTICS
OF


93
0:7:38,12 --> 0:7:41,46
PARENCHYMA CELLS. THE FIRST CHARACTERISTIC,
THIS IS


94
0:7:41,46 --> 0:7:44,879
IMPORTANT ONE, YOU WILL SEE THIS SHORTLY WHY
THIS IS


95
0:7:44,879 --> 0:7:55,69
SO IMPORTANT, IS THAT THEY ARE ALIVE WHEN
FUNCTIONAL.


96
0:7:55,69 --> 0:7:58,8
SECOND CHARACTERISTIC OF THE MANY, BUT I WILL


97
0:7:58,8 --> 0:8:2,69
CHOOSE 3 THAT ARE PROBABLY IMPORTANT FOR TODAY'S
TALK,


98
0:8:2,69 --> 0:8:10,18
IS THAT THEY HAVE THIN WALLS. THIN WALLS.
AND THIRD


99
0:8:10,18 --> 0:8:19,259
THAT THEY CAN BE STIMULATED TO DIVIDE.


100
0:8:19,259 --> 0:8:22,979
AND THIS STIMULATION TO DIVIDE OFTEN INVOLVES


101
0:8:22,979 --> 0:8:30,27
THEM IN REPAIRING WOUNDS.


102
0:8:30,27 --> 0:8:32,669
SO, IF YOU CUT INTO A PLANT AND YOU MAKE A
WOUND


103
0:8:32,669 --> 0:8:36,459
OR A CAR BACKS INTO A TREE AND MAKES A GAUGE
OR WOUND


104
0:8:36,459 --> 0:8:40,93
PARENCHYMA CELLS STIMULATE AND DIVIDE AND
REPAIR THAT


105
0:8:40,93 --> 0:8:46,94
 WOUND. NOW LET'S DISCUSS SOME OF THE FUNCTIONS
OF THE


106
0:8:46,94 --> 0:8:50,66
PARENCHYMA CELLS. THESE LIVING CELLS WITHIN
CELL


107
0:8:50,66 --> 0:8:55,1
WALLS. FOR OUR PURPOSES THEY HAVE TWO MAIN
FUNCTIONS,


108
0:8:55,1 --> 0:8:58,38
ALTHOUGH IN SPECIALIZED CASES THEY HAVE OTHER


109
0:8:58,38 --> 0:9:0,66
FUNCTIONS. THOSE TWO FUNCTIONS ARE:


110
0:9:0,66 --> 0:9:11,61
1. THEY FUNCTION IN PHOTOSYNTHESIS. THAT IS,


111
0:9:11,61 --> 0:9:22,57
PHOTOSYNTHESIS OCCURS IN PARENCHYMA CELLS
AND SECONDLY


112
0:9:22,57 --> 0:9:29,95
THEY FUNCTION IN STORAGE.


113
0:9:29,95 --> 0:9:31,91
USUALLY THE COMPOUND WHICH


114
0:9:31,91 --> 0:9:38,72
IS STORED INSIDE OF THEM IS STARCH.


115
0:9:38,72 --> 0:9:42,0
MOST OF YOU HAVE HAD INTIMATE CONTACT OR


116
0:9:42,0 --> 0:9:44,63
INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF PARENCHYMA CELLS IN
THE FORM OF


117
0:9:44,63 --> 0:9:48,959
A POTATO. IF WE COULD PEEL THIS POTATO ALL
OF THE


118
0:9:48,959 --> 0:9:51,5
CELLS THAT ARE INSIDE THE POTATO, ALL OF THE


119
0:9:51,5 --> 0:9:53,399
STARCH-FILLED CELLS INSIDE OF THE POTATO ARE


120
0:9:53,399 --> 0:9:56,519
PARENCHYMA CELLS. THE POTATO IS BASICALLY
MADE UP OF


121
0:9:56,519 --> 0:9:59,76
SIMPLE THIN WALLED CELLS WHICH FUNCTION TO
STORE


122
0:9:59,76 --> 0:10:5,579
STARCH. THIS IS THE FIRST CELL TYPE WHICH
WE BELIEVE


123
0:10:5,579 --> 0:10:8,759
IS THE TYPE FROM WHICH ALL OF THE OTHER CELLS
IN THE


124
0:10:8,759 --> 0:10:13,279
 PRIMARY PLANT BODY ARE EVOLVED FROM. NOW
LET'S


125
0:10:13,279 --> 0:10:19,48
CONSIDER THE SECOND CELL TYPE:


126
0:10:19,48 --> 0:10:21,88
AGAIN, ONE IN WHICH MANY OF YOU HAVE HAD CONTACT


127
0:10:21,88 --> 0:10:25,6
WITH WITHOUT REALIZING IT. IT IS CALLED COLLENCHYMA.


128
0:10:25,6 --> 0:10:28,7
IT HAS ALL OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF PARENCHYMA
CELLS,


129
0:10:28,7 --> 0:10:33,98
THAT IT IS ALIVE. BUT IT HAS ONE STRUCTURAL


130
0:10:33,98 --> 0:10:45,17
DIFFERENCE. IT HAS VARIOUSLY THICKENED WALLS.


131
0:10:45,17 --> 0:10:48,63
VARIOUSLY THICKENED WALLS. AND AS A RESULT,
AND I WILL


132
0:10:48,63 --> 0:10:50,64
SHOW YOU SOME PICTURES OF THESE THICK WALLS,
IT


133
0:10:50,64 --> 0:11:1,6
FUNCTIONS IN SUPPORT.


134
0:11:1,6 --> 0:11:3,57
EXAMPLES OF COLLENCHYMA CELLS THAT I BELIEVE
ALL


135
0:11:3,57 --> 0:11:6,98
OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH ARE FOUND IN CELERY.
IN


136
0:11:6,98 --> 0:11:10,44
CELERY, THIS STRUCTURE THAT WE EAT IS PART
OF THE


137
0:11:10,44 --> 0:11:13,45
LEAF, PART OF THE PETIOLE. THE LEAF HAS BEEN
CUT OFF.


138
0:11:13,45 --> 0:11:16,74
WE DON'T EAT THE LEAF BUT THE COLLENCHYMA
CELLS ARE


139
0:11:16,74 --> 0:11:20,959
WHAT GIVE THIS PETIOLE ITS SUPPORT BUT MAKE
IT RIGID


140
0:11:20,959 --> 0:11:24,26
AND UPRIGHT. IF YOU BREAK A CELERY AND HAVE
THESE


141
0:11:24,26 --> 0:11:27,47
STRANDS, STRINGS THAT YOU PULL OFF THESE STRINGS
ARE


142
0:11:27,47 --> 0:11:30,279
 COLLENCHYMA. THESE ARE THE ONES WHICH GIVE
THIS


143
0:11:30,279 --> 0:11:33,6
PETIOLE ITS SUPPORT, GIVE IT ITS RIGIDITY.


144
0:11:33,6 --> 0:11:37,459
COLLENCHYMA CAN OCCUR IN BUNDLES OR STRANDS
OR THEY


145
0:11:37,459 --> 0:11:40,55
CAN OCCUR SEPARATELY. NOTICE THEY ARE AT THE


146
0:11:40,55 --> 0:11:43,649
PERIPHERY TOWARD THE OUTSIDE OF THE CELERY.
IF YOU


147
0:11:43,649 --> 0:11:45,649
WERE AN ENGINEER THAT IS WHERE YOU WOULD WANT
TO PLACE


148
0:11:45,649 --> 0:11:50,519
YOUR SUPPORT, IF YOU WERE DESIGNING A BUILDING.
THIRD


149
0:11:50,519 --> 0:11:54,66
CELL TYPE, WHICH I WANT TO CONSIDER, IS ALSO
DERIVED


150
0:11:54,66 --> 0:12:0,32
FROM THE PARENCHYMA. BUT, IT REALLY CONSISTS
OF TWO


151
0:12:0,32 --> 0:12:3,24
CELL TYPES WHICH MAKE IT UP AND SO I AM GOING
TO GIVE


152
0:12:3,24 --> 0:12:6,87
YOU A GENERALIZED NAME AND THEN CONSIDER THE
TWO CELL


153
0:12:6,87 --> 0:12:12,29
TYPES WHICH MAKE IT UP. IT IS CALLED SCLERENCHYMA.


154
0:12:12,29 --> 0:12:19,16
SCLERENCHYMA DIFFERS FROM PARENCHYMA AND COLLENCHYMA


155
0:12:19,16 --> 0:12:23,72
BY, THE GIVE-AWAY IS THIS NAME. THE WORD SCLERENCHYMA


156
0:12:23,72 --> 0:12:28,93
COMES FROM THE GREEK WORD SKLIRA, WHICH MEANS
HARD.


157
0:12:28,93 --> 0:12:36,81
SCLERENCHYMA CELLS HAVE IMBEDDED OR AS PART
OF THE


158
0:12:36,81 --> 0:12:50,8
CELL WALL A HARD COMPOUND KNOWN AS LIGNIN,
KNOWN AS


159
0:12:50,8 --> 0:12:55,67
LIGNIN. THIS GIVES THE WORDS SKLIRAS, AND
MAKES THE


160
0:12:55,67 --> 0:13:6,18
 CELLS HARD. THEY FUNCTION IN SUPPORT. WE
BELIEVE


161
0:13:6,18 --> 0:13:10,67
ALSO IN PROTECTION. I WILL SHOW YOU THE, WHY
WE THINK


162
0:13:10,67 --> 0:13:11,73
IT IS INVOLVED IN PROTECTION.


163
0:13:11,73 --> 0:13:21,339
THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF SCLERENCHYMA


164
0:13:21,339 --> 0:13:24,25
CELLS, BOTH OF WHICH YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH,
ALTHOUGH


165
0:13:24,25 --> 0:13:26,99
PROBABLY THE NAME OF ONLY WHICH YOU WILL BE
FAMILIAR


166
0:13:26,99 --> 0:13:30,66
WITH WHEN WE START THIS DISCUSSION. SCLERENCHYMA
COMES


167
0:13:30,66 --> 0:13:33,85
IN TWO TYPES OF CELLS, THEY COME IN CELLS,
WHICH YOU


168
0:13:33,85 --> 0:13:42,649
KNOW OF AS FIBERS. AND THE SECOND GROUP SCLEROID.


169
0:13:42,649 --> 0:13:47,709
LET'S FIRST TALK ABOUT FIBERS. FIBERS ARE
ELONGATED


170
0:13:47,709 --> 0:14:0,63
CELLS, ELONGATED CELLS WITH OVERLAPPING END
WALLS.


171
0:14:0,63 --> 0:14:5,38
SO, YOU CAN PRETEND LIKE THIS IS A FIBER,
ONE FIBER.


172
0:14:5,38 --> 0:14:9,89
AND HERE WOULD BE A SECOND FIBER AND HERE
WOULD BE THE


173
0:14:9,89 --> 0:14:19,63
OVERLAPPING END WALLS. THEY TEND TO OCCUR
IN BUNDLES.


174
0:14:19,63 --> 0:14:23,49
AN EXAMPLE OF A PRODUCT MADE FROM FIBERS THAT


175
0:14:23,49 --> 0:14:29,76
MOST OF YOU AWARE OF IS ROPE. ROPE IS GRITTY
AND


176
0:14:29,76 --> 0:14:33,81
TOUGH AND COARSE BECAUSE OF THE LIGNIN WHICH
IS


177
0:14:33,81 --> 0:14:36,24
DEPOSITED IN THE FIBERS AND WHAT GIVES THE
ROPE ITS


178
0:14:36,24 --> 0:14:41,66
 STRENGTH ARE THE OVERLAPPING FIBER. NOW,
IN SOME


179
0:14:41,66 --> 0:14:47,519
INSTANCES THE FIBERS DON'T BECOME LIGNIFIED,
THEY


180
0:14:47,519 --> 0:14:50,649
DON'T GET LIGNIN DEPOSITED INTO THEM UNTIL
THE PLANT


181
0:14:50,649 --> 0:14:54,899
GETS QUITE OLD. IN THAT PARTICULAR SITUATION
HUMANS


182
0:14:54,899 --> 0:14:58,79
HAVE EXPLOITED THIS SITUATION FOR MILLENNIA
AND


183
0:14:58,79 --> 0:15:1,55
ILLUSTRATED BY THIS PLANT HERE. THIS IS THE
PLANT


184
0:15:1,55 --> 0:15:6,61
WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE LINUM PLANT. WHICH IS
WHERE


185
0:15:6,61 --> 0:15:14,86
VERY FINE LINEN COMES FROM. IN LINUM LIGNIN


186
0:15:14,86 --> 0:15:22,44
DEPOSITION IS DELAYED.


187
0:15:22,44 --> 0:15:26,25
THIS RESULTS IN THE PRODUCTION OF SO-CALLED
SOFT


188
0:15:26,25 --> 0:15:31,139
FIBERS. THEY AREN'T HARD AND COARSE LIKE YOU
WOULD


189
0:15:31,139 --> 0:15:33,829
FIND IN THE ROPE.


190
0:15:33,829 --> 0:15:35,82
THE FIBERS, AS I WILL SHOW YOU A PICTURE OF
AND


191
0:15:35,82 --> 0:15:38,19
SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE ACTUALLY HAD EXPERIENCE
WITH THIS


192
0:15:38,19 --> 0:15:43,63
OCCUR IN BUNDLES IN THIS LINUM PLANT. SINCE
EARLY


193
0:15:43,63 --> 0:15:46,38
DAYS, SINCE BEFORE THE EGYPTIANS, THIS PLANT
WAS GROWN


194
0:15:46,38 --> 0:15:51,4
AND THE FIBERS WERE COMBED OUT OF THIS PLANT
ON VERY


195
0:15:51,4 --> 0:15:53,98
FINE TOOTH COMBS. THEY COME OUT IN BUNDLES
AND THEY


196
0:15:53,98 --> 0:15:57,709
 ARE USED TO MAKE FINE LINEN, LIKE HANDKERCHIEFS
AND


197
0:15:57,709 --> 0:16:0,459
VERY FINE TABLE CLOTHS, SCARVES. THESE ARE
WHAT ARE


198
0:16:0,459 --> 0:16:5,42
MADE OF FINE LINEN OR MADE FROM THE LINUM.
EVENTUALLY


199
0:16:5,42 --> 0:16:9,5
THESE FIBERS WILL BECOME, HAVE LIGNIN IN THEM
BUT NOT


200
0:16:9,5 --> 0:16:11,66
FOR A LONG TIME. NOT LIKE THE FIBERS THAT
MAKE THE


201
0:16:11,66 --> 0:16:15,29
ROPE. NOW, HERE IS AN EXAMPLE WHERE FIBERS
ARE


202
0:16:15,29 --> 0:16:19,779
ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN MAKING THE SHAPE OR SUPPORT
OF


203
0:16:19,779 --> 0:16:23,6
A PARTICULAR, IN THIS CASE, IT IS A LOOFAH.
SOME OF


204
0:16:23,6 --> 0:16:28,639
YOU KNOW WHAT LOOFAH SPONGES ARE. LOOFAH IS
A MEMBERS


205
0:16:28,639 --> 0:16:33,769
OF THE SQUASH OR GOURD FAMILY WHAT IS DONE
IS THAT THE


206
0:16:33,769 --> 0:16:36,449
ORGANIC MATERIAL WHICH CAN BE EASILY DIGESTED
OR


207
0:16:36,449 --> 0:16:39,63
DEGRADED AWAY IS EITHER DEGRADED AWAY WITH
ACID OR BY


208
0:16:39,63 --> 0:16:43,8
MICROBIAL ACTIVITIES, LEAVING BEHIND ESSENTIALLY
THE


209
0:16:43,8 --> 0:16:47,16
STRUCTURE OF THE GOURD, WHICH IS ALL FIBERS.
THESE


210
0:16:47,16 --> 0:16:50,639
FIBERS HAVE (INAUDIBLE) IN THEM FOR THOSE
OF YOU WHO


211
0:16:50,639 --> 0:16:53,3
HAVE USED IT. AND ARE USED FOR WASHING YOURSELF
IN


212
0:16:53,3 --> 0:16:58,41
THE BATHROOM. SO THIS PARTICULAR GOURD AND
MANY OTHER


213
0:16:58,41 --> 0:17:0,829
FRUITS THAT WE WILL TALK ABOUT HAVE THEIR
SHAPE AS


214
0:17:0,829 --> 0:17:3,529
 A RESULT OF FIBERS. AND WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING
AT NOW


215
0:17:3,529 --> 0:17:6,459
IS THE FIBER MESH NETWORK THAT GIVES THIS
GOURD ITS


216
0:17:6,459 --> 0:17:11,23
SHAPE. SO THESE ARE FIBERS, COMMERCIALLY EXTREMELY


217
0:17:11,23 --> 0:17:17,4
IMPORTANT THEY ARE USED BY US ON A DAILY BASIS.


218
0:17:17,4 --> 0:17:20,85
SECOND GROUP OR TYPE OF CELLS WHICH MAKE UP
THE


219
0:17:20,85 --> 0:17:24,12
SCLERENCHYMA IS LESS FAMILIAR TO MOST OF YOU,
BUT I


220
0:17:24,12 --> 0:17:27,72
GUARANTEE MOST OF YOU HAVE USED THESE IN MANY
WAYS.


221
0:17:27,72 --> 0:17:30,89
THESE ARE THE SCLEROIDS. THESE TEND TO FUNCTION
IN


222
0:17:30,89 --> 0:17:34,47
PROTECTION. ALTHOUGH NOT ALWAYS. WE ARE NOT
QUITE SURE


223
0:17:34,47 --> 0:17:38,929
SOMETIMES WHY THEY FUNCTION. THEY TEND TO
BE SHORT,


224
0:17:38,929 --> 0:17:45,5
ROUND, SOMETIMES, AND SOMETIMES EVEN POINTED
CELLS.


225
0:17:45,5 --> 0:17:50,2
SHORT, ROUND, POINTED CELLS.


226
0:17:50,2 --> 0:18:1,169
THEY HAVE VERY THICK WALLS.


227
0:18:1,169 --> 0:18:2,36
AND SOME EXAMPLES


228
0:18:2,36 --> 0:18:6,23
OF WHERE SCLEROIDS ARE USED, ARE FOR EXAMPLE,
IN THE


229
0:18:6,23 --> 0:18:10,23
SHELL OF WALNUTS. THE REASON THE SHELL IS
SO HARD IS


230
0:18:10,23 --> 0:18:15,34
BECAUSE IT HAS SCLEROIDS OR THE CELLS WHICH
ARE PART


231
0:18:15,34 --> 0:18:18,32
OF THE SHELL WALL HAVE SCLEROIDS IN THEM.
AND IT


232
0:18:18,32 --> 0:18:21,4
MAKES THIS PROTECT THE DEVELOPING EMBRYO ON
THE


233
0:18:21,4 --> 0:18:22,32
 INSIDE.


234
0:18:22,32 --> 0:18:25,799
SOME MORE COMMON USES OF SCLEROIDS THAT YOU
MAY


235
0:18:25,799 --> 0:18:30,309
OF ARE IN PEARS. WHEN YOU EAT PEARS THE GRITTY
NATURE


236
0:18:30,309 --> 0:18:34,32
OF THE PEAR IS THE RESULT OF SCLEROIDS. THESE
STONE


237
0:18:34,32 --> 0:18:36,86
CELLS THAT ARE LOCATED IN THE PEAR AND GIVE
IT ITS


238
0:18:36,86 --> 0:18:40,96
GRITTY TEXTURE. SOMETIMES THIS GRITTINESS
MAY TURN OUT


239
0:18:40,96 --> 0:18:45,9
TO BE SOMETHING WE EXPECT. FOR EXAMPLE, FIG
NEWTONS,


240
0:18:45,9 --> 0:18:47,6
WHEN YOU EAT FIG NEWTONS AND YOU GET A LITTLE
GRITTY


241
0:18:47,6 --> 0:18:50,679
NATURE YOU ARE ACTUALLY CHOMPING ON SOME SCLEROID
THAT


242
0:18:50,679 --> 0:18:55,39
ARE IN THE SEED OR THE FRUIT OF THE SMALL
FIG. AT ONE


243
0:18:55,39 --> 0:18:57,59
TIME THEY DISCOVERED A FIG WHICH DIDN'T HAVE
SCLEROIDS


244
0:18:57,59 --> 0:18:59,929
AND THEY TRIED TO MAKE FIG NEWTONS OUT OF
IT AND


245
0:18:59,929 --> 0:19:3,59
PEOPLE WOULDN'T BUY IT. BECAUSE THEY EXPECTED
FIG


246
0:19:3,59 --> 0:19:6,48
NEWTONS TO HAVE A GRITTY NATURE. NOW WHY HAVE
THESE


247
0:19:6,48 --> 0:19:9,169
SCLEROIDS? WE THINK THAT THE SCLEROIDS WHAT
THEY


248
0:19:9,169 --> 0:19:14,23
PROBABLY DO ARE USED TO RETARD INSECTS FROM,
NOT IN


249
0:19:14,23 --> 0:19:16,2
THE CASE OF THE WALNUT, BUT IN THE CASE OF
THE FIG


250
0:19:16,2 --> 0:19:19,649
NEWTON OR THE PEAR TO RETARD INSECTS FROM
EATING THESE


251
0:19:19,649 --> 0:19:22,64
 PARTICULAR FRUITS. YOU CAN IMAGINE IF YOU
WERE AN


252
0:19:22,64 --> 0:19:24,799
INSECT AND YOU HAD MANDIBLES, IF YOU BIT INTO


253
0:19:24,799 --> 0:19:27,669
SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND YOU ENCOUNTER ONE
OF THESE


254
0:19:27,669 --> 0:19:31,309
STONE CELLS IS MIGHT RETARD YOU OR SLOW YOU
DOWN FROM


255
0:19:31,309 --> 0:19:34,0
GETTING INTO THE FRUIT. WE THINK THEY HAVE
A FUNCTION


256
0:19:34,0 --> 0:19:40,44
WITH REGARD TO THESE PARTICULAR TYPES OF PROTECTIVE


257
0:19:40,44 --> 0:19:42,3
MECHANISMS.


258
0:19:42,3 --> 0:19:44,76
LET ME SHOW YOU A FEW SLIDES, IF WE CAN GET
THIS


259
0:19:44,76 --> 0:19:57,22
TO GO FOR US, A FEW SLIDES OF SOME OF THESE.


260
0:19:57,22 --> 0:19:59,88
OKAY, FIRST SLIDE IS MEANT TO SHOW YOU, TO


261
0:19:59,88 --> 0:20:4,8
REMIND YOU OF THE APICAL MERISTEM LOCATIONS
WHERE


262
0:20:4,8 --> 0:20:8,549
PRIMARY GROWTH IS PRODUCED. EVERY BRANCH,
AXIS WHICH


263
0:20:8,549 --> 0:20:12,98
GROWS IN LENGTH HAS APICAL MERISTEM AT ITS
TIP. ALL


264
0:20:12,98 --> 0:20:15,4
OF THE ROOTS, WHICH ARE GROWING IN LENGTH,
THE MAIN


265
0:20:15,4 --> 0:20:16,98
TIP OF THE ROOT, WHICH IS GROWING IN LENGTH.
ALL OF


266
0:20:16,98 --> 0:20:19,99
THEM HAVE APICAL MERISTEM. AND THIS IS AN
IMPORTANT


267
0:20:19,99 --> 0:20:22,46
POINT THAT YOU HAVE TO REALIZE. ALL THINGS
THAT GROW


268
0:20:22,46 --> 0:20:25,2
IN LENGTH HAVE TO HAVE A APICAL MERISTEM.
HERE ARE


269
0:20:25,2 --> 0:20:27,659
 SOME PARENCHYMA CELLS NOW. NOTICE THAT THEY
ARE


270
0:20:27,659 --> 0:20:31,0
RELATIVELY THIN-WALLED. THEY ARE ALIVE AND
APPEAR TO


271
0:20:31,0 --> 0:20:34,75
BE EMPTY. HERE ARE PARENCHYMA CELLS WHICH
CONTAIN


272
0:20:34,75 --> 0:20:37,35
STARCH. THEY ARE COMPLETELY PACKED WITH STARCH
AS YOU


273
0:20:37,35 --> 0:20:40,38
FIND IN POTATO. THESE DARK, SORT OF STAINED
BODIES ARE


274
0:20:40,38 --> 0:20:43,9
STARCH. NEXT SLIDE SHOWS YOU SOME COLLENCHYMA.
WE


275
0:20:43,9 --> 0:20:46,25
ARE LOOKING DOWN ON A COLLENCHYMA CELL. IN
THESE


276
0:20:46,25 --> 0:20:48,83
PARTICULAR COLLENCHYMA CELLS THEY PUT THICKENING
OF


277
0:20:48,83 --> 0:20:52,5
THE CELL WALLS ONLY IN THE CORNERS, NOT IN
BETWEEN.


278
0:20:52,5 --> 0:20:55,659
THIS IS AN INTERESTING EXAMPLE. HERE WE CAN
HAVE


279
0:20:55,659 --> 0:20:57,97
SHEATHS OF COLLENCHYMA. THIS IS A STEM WHICH
HAS BEEN


280
0:20:57,97 --> 0:21:0,32
CUT ACROSS AT SECTION AND HERE ARE SHEATHS
OF


281
0:21:0,32 --> 0:21:3,59
COLLENCHYMA, WHICH I WILL SHOW YOU IN A HIGHER
POWER.


282
0:21:3,59 --> 0:21:6,409
HERE YOU CAN SEE THICKENED CELL WALLS, AGAIN
AS YOU


283
0:21:6,409 --> 0:21:9,11
WOULD FIND IN THE CELERY WHICH WE BELIEVE
PROVIDES


284
0:21:9,11 --> 0:21:10,63
SUPPORT.


285
0:21:10,63 --> 0:21:13,46
HERE ARE FIBER. THIS IS A CROSS SECTION, CUT


286
0:21:13,46 --> 0:21:15,6
ACROSS THE STEM OF THIS PLANT WHICH IS UP
HERE IN


287
0:21:15,6 --> 0:21:18,78
 FRONT, THE LINUM PLANT. IT IS NOT NORMALLY
RED INSIDE.


288
0:21:18,78 --> 0:21:21,82
THIS IS STAIN OR A DYE WHICH HAS BEEN PUT
ON, BUT I


289
0:21:21,82 --> 0:21:24,61
WANT TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE BUNDLES
OF FIBERS


290
0:21:24,61 --> 0:21:28,39
WHICH ARE LOCATED TOWARDS THE OUTSIDE. HUGE
NUMBER OF


291
0:21:28,39 --> 0:21:31,58
FIBERS, IF WE LOOK AT THE FIBERS A LITTLE
HIGHER


292
0:21:31,58 --> 0:21:34,34
POWERED HERE, YOU CAN SEE, THERE ARE TREMENDOUS


293
0:21:34,34 --> 0:21:37,94
FIBERS, THEY HAVE A VERY SMALL INSIDE CYTOPLASM
AND


294
0:21:37,94 --> 0:21:41,65
VERY THICK WALLS. IN THIS CASE THEY ARE SOFT
FIBERS.


295
0:21:41,65 --> 0:21:44,309
HERE ARE SOME SCLEROIDS NOW, WHICH WE BELIEVE
FUNCTION


296
0:21:44,309 --> 0:21:46,84
TO PROTECT PLANTS FROM INSECTS AND OTHER SMALL


297
0:21:46,84 --> 0:21:50,23
ANIMALS. YOU CAN SEE THESE CELLS ARE, THEY
HAVE LOTS


298
0:21:50,23 --> 0:21:52,919
OF POINTS ON THEM AND THESE POINTS WE THINK,
THIS IS A


299
0:21:52,919 --> 0:21:56,25
CAMELLIA LEAF, THESE POINTS WE THINK ARE PROBABLY
WHAT


300
0:21:56,25 --> 0:21:58,909
KEEPS ANIMALS FROM EATING IT. HERE IS A SCLEROID


301
0:21:58,909 --> 0:22:1,86
FOUND IN A WATER PLANT, A WATER PLANT, THE
LEAF


302
0:22:1,86 --> 0:22:4,919
PROBABLY TO RETARD ANIMALS IN THE WATER FROM
EATING


303
0:22:4,919 --> 0:22:7,83
THE LEAF. HERE ARE THE SCLEROIDS THAT YOU
WOULD FIND


304
0:22:7,83 --> 0:22:12,76
IN THE PIT OF A PEACH. IN THIS PARTICULAR
CASE, THE


305
0:22:12,76 --> 0:22:17,169
 PEACH PIT IS ESSENTIALLY ALL SCLEROIDS AND
IT IS


306
0:22:17,169 --> 0:22:21,48
A VERY, DIFFICULT FOR US TO BITE INTO AND
OF COURSE IT


307
0:22:21,48 --> 0:22:23,89
WOULD BE FOR AN ANIMAL AS WELL. THE SEED WOULD
BE


308
0:22:23,89 --> 0:22:27,39
PROTECTED.


309
0:22:27,39 --> 0:22:30,2
THESE ARE THEN THE FIRST GROUP OF CELLS, THE


310
0:22:30,2 --> 0:22:33,35
PARENCHYMA, THE COLLENCHYMA AND THE SCLERENCHYMA.


311
0:22:33,35 --> 0:22:37,289
THEY ARE MORE OR LESS SIMPLE CELL TYPES. NOW
WHAT I


312
0:22:37,289 --> 0:22:40,58
WOULD LIKE TO DO IS BEGIN A DISCUSSION OF
OUR FIRST


313
0:22:40,58 --> 0:22:44,63
TISSUE. OUR FIRST TISSUE. AND THIS TISSUE
CONSISTS


314
0:22:44,63 --> 0:22:47,539
OF A LARGE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CELL TYPES
AND THIS


315
0:22:47,539 --> 0:22:54,88
FIRST TISSUE IS THE VASCULAR TISSUE. THE VASCULAR


316
0:22:54,88 --> 0:23:3,98
TISSUE IS INVOLVED WITH TRANSPORT. INVOLVED
WITH


317
0:23:3,98 --> 0:23:7,52
TRANSPORT. AND THE VASCULAR TISSUE CONSISTS
OF TWO


318
0:23:7,52 --> 0:23:9,76
DIFFERENT CELL OR TISSUE TYPES, AND WE ARE
GOING TO


319
0:23:9,76 --> 0:23:16,299
SPEND TIME FIRST CELL TYPE IS KNOWN AS XYLEM.
AND


320
0:23:16,299 --> 0:23:26,299
THIS IS INVOLVED MAINLY WITH WATER TRANSPORT.


321
0:23:26,299 --> 0:23:31,409
AND THE SECOND CELL TYPE IS PHLOEM. THIS IS


322
0:23:31,409 --> 0:23:55,94
MAINLY INVOLVED WITH TRANSPORT OF NUTRIENTS.
 
LET'S BEGIN BY TALKING ABOUT THE XYLEM.


323
0:23:55,94 --> 0:23:58,33
THE FIRST THING I WANT TO SAY, WHICH IS CENTRAL


324
0:23:58,33 --> 0:24:0,909
TO OUR DISCUSSION OF HOW THE XYLEM WORKS,
IS THAT


325
0:24:0,909 --> 0:24:5,98
THESE CELLS ARE DEAD WHEN FUNCTIONAL.


326
0:24:5,98 --> 0:24:10,5
WE WILL EXPLORE THIS STATEMENT A LITTLE MORE
IN


327
0:24:10,5 --> 0:24:12,96
A MOMENT.


328
0:24:12,96 --> 0:24:15,4
THERE ARE TWO CELL TYPES WHICH ARE THE MAIN


329
0:24:15,4 --> 0:24:17,77
TRANSPORT TYPES IN XYLEM AND I WANT TO GIVE
YOU THEIR


330
0:24:17,77 --> 0:24:24,89
NAMES. THEY ARE KNOWN AS TRACHEIDS OR TRACHEARY


331
0:24:24,89 --> 0:24:30,669
ELEMENTS. YOU WILL SEE IT REFERRED TO IN BOTH
WAYS IN


332
0:24:30,669 --> 0:24:37,679
YOUR BOOK OR -- THE SECOND CELL TYPE IS KNOWN
AS


333
0:24:37,679 --> 0:24:49,14
VESSEL ELEMENTS OR VESSEL MEMBERS.


334
0:24:49,14 --> 0:24:49,6
NOW WHAT I WANT TO


335
0:24:49,6 --> 0:24:58,86
SAY TO YOU ABOUT THESE TWO CELL TYPES, IN
GYMNOSPERMS


336
0:24:58,86 --> 0:25:6,13
WE ONLY FIND TRACHEIDS.


337
0:25:6,13 --> 0:25:13,9
WHEREAS, IN ANGIOSPERMS,


338
0:25:13,9 --> 0:25:15,25
BOTH TRACHEIDS AND


339
0:25:15,25 --> 0:25:34,52
VESSEL ELEMENTS ARE INVOLVED IN WATER TRANSPORT.


340
0:25:34,52 --> 0:25:40,33
THIS IS PROBABLY AN EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE. WHEN


341
0:25:40,33 --> 0:25:45,19
WE EVOLVED UP TO ANGIOSPERM WE DEVELOPED AN
ADDITIONAL


342
0:25:45,19 --> 0:25:50,159
 TYPE OF CELL FOR THE TRANSPORT OF WATER
AND THAT CELL


343
0:25:50,159 --> 0:25:53,45
WAS THE VESSEL ELEMENT. LET'S LOOK FIRST AT
A


344
0:25:53,45 --> 0:25:58,86
TRACHEID. A TRACHEID IS GENERALLY A THIN CELL.


345
0:25:58,86 --> 0:26:14,38
A THIN CELL, TRACHEID, WITH OVERLAPPING END
WALLS.


346
0:26:14,38 --> 0:26:18,97
THIS IS CONTRASTED WITH A VESSEL ELEMENT.


347
0:26:18,97 --> 0:26:22,159
VESSEL ELEMENT, WHICH I WILL ABBREVIATE AS,
VE,


348
0:26:22,159 --> 0:26:27,309
VESSEL ELEMENTS. VESSEL ELEMENTS ARE WIDE
AND SHORT


349
0:26:27,309 --> 0:26:33,35
OR SHORTER. LET'S NOW DRAW A VESSEL ELEMENT.
HERE IS


350
0:26:33,35 --> 0:26:39,26
ONE VESSEL ELEMENT, ONE VESSEL ELEMENT HERE.


351
0:26:39,26 --> 0:26:43,88
NOW WATER TRANSPORT OCCURS BECAUSE VESSEL


352
0:26:43,88 --> 0:26:45,799
ELEMENTS ARE CONNECTED TOGETHER.


353
0:26:45,799 --> 0:26:48,909
SO, THIS IS ONE VESSEL ELEMENT. HERE WOULD
BE


354
0:26:48,909 --> 0:26:53,12
A SECOND VESSEL ELEMENT AND HERE WOULD BE
A THIRD


355
0:26:53,12 --> 0:26:54,97
VESSEL ELEMENT.


356
0:26:54,97 --> 0:26:58,62
3 VESSEL ELEMENT CELLS CONNECTED TOGETHER.


357
0:26:58,62 --> 0:27:2,24
THIS WHOLE STRUCTURE IS CALLED A VESSEL.


358
0:27:2,24 --> 0:27:7,35
WHOLE STRUCTURE IS CALLED A VESSEL. HOW DOES


359
0:27:7,35 --> 0:27:11,5
A VESSEL ELEMENT FORM AND WHERE DO WE GET
THE VESSEL


360
0:27:11,5 --> 0:27:18,15
 TO FORM FROM? BASICALLY, IT STARTS OUT WITH


361
0:27:18,15 --> 0:27:24,71
INDIVIDUAL LIVING XYLEM.


362
0:27:24,71 --> 0:27:27,46
INDIVIDUAL LIVING XYLEM. AND THEN WE HAVE


363
0:27:27,46 --> 0:27:29,669
A TERM THAT MOST OF YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT BEFORE,
WE


364
0:27:29,669 --> 0:27:38,669
HAVE PROGRAM CELL DEATH.


365
0:27:38,669 --> 0:27:40,899
ALL OF THE CYTOPLASM


366
0:27:40,899 --> 0:27:50,48
DISAPPEARS IN THE CELLS AND THE END WALLS
DISSOLVE TO


367
0:27:50,48 --> 0:27:51,21
MAKE THIS VESSEL.


368
0:27:51,21 --> 0:27:58,76
SO BASICALLY, YOU HAVE A TUBE, YOU HAVE A
PIPE,


369
0:27:58,76 --> 0:28:1,36
A WHOLE PIPE RUNNING THROUGH OR SERIES OF
PIPES


370
0:28:1,36 --> 0:28:5,44
RUNNING THROUGH THE PLANT AND YOU ACTUALLY
CAN TAKE


371
0:28:5,44 --> 0:28:7,74
A STEM OF A PLANT, WHICH HAS LOTS OF VESSELS,
FOR


372
0:28:7,74 --> 0:28:9,97
THOSE OF YOU SITTING UP HERE IN THE FRONT,
I WILL BLOW


373
0:28:9,97 --> 0:28:14,429
INTO THIS END AND MY BREATH WILL TRAVEL DOWN
THROUGH


374
0:28:14,429 --> 0:28:16,77
THE EMPTY VESSELS, WHICH ARE DEAD, AND YOU
SHOULD BE


375
0:28:16,77 --> 0:28:19,49
ABLE TO SEE BUBBLES EMERGE FROM THE BASE THERE.


376
0:28:19,49 --> 0:28:22,529
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE THERE. YOU COULD
USE


377
0:28:22,529 --> 0:28:25,809
IT AS A STRAW BUT YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO
SEE IT. SO,


378
0:28:25,809 --> 0:28:29,51
THIS IS A VESSEL. AND VESSELS CONDUCT WATER
AND THEY


379
0:28:29,51 --> 0:28:37,399
 ARE DEAD WHEN FUNCTIONAL. A VERY IMPORTANT
POINT.
THE


380
0:28:37,399 --> 0:28:41,299
OTHER CELL TYPE, WHICH MAKES UP THE VASCULAR
TISSUE,


381
0:28:41,299 --> 0:28:51,97
NAMELY THE PHLOEM. THE PHLOEM, THE PHLOEM
CONSISTS OF


382
0:28:51,97 --> 0:28:56,94
A CELL TYPE NOT LIKE THE TRACHEID VESSEL,
BUT IS A


383
0:28:56,94 --> 0:29:2,46
DIFFERENT CELL TYPE. THE PHLOEM CELL TYPE


384
0:29:2,46 --> 0:29:9,88
TRANSPORTING NUTRIENTS IS CALLED A SIEVE ELEMENT.


385
0:29:9,88 --> 0:29:20,76
WHICH WE WILL ABBREVIATE, SE.


386
0:29:20,76 --> 0:29:23,33
NOW WHAT IS A SIEVE ELEMENT AND WHERE DID
WE GET


387
0:29:23,33 --> 0:29:28,0
THIS NAME FROM?


388
0:29:28,0 --> 0:29:32,63
LIKE THE VESSEL ELEMENTS, THE SIEVE ELEMENTS
ARE


389
0:29:32,63 --> 0:29:33,62
CONNECTED IN A ROW.


390
0:29:33,62 --> 0:29:44,309
EACH OF THESE IS A SIEVE ELEMENT.


391
0:29:44,309 --> 0:29:47,23
WHERE DOES THE NAME SIEVE COME FROM? I WOULD


392
0:29:47,23 --> 0:29:49,8
LIKE ALL OF YOU TO WATCH WHAT I AM GOING TO
DO HERE


393
0:29:49,8 --> 0:29:51,919
BECAUSE THIS WILL EXPLAIN TO YOU. IF WE PRETENDED


394
0:29:51,919 --> 0:29:54,909
LIKE THIS ERASER WAS ONE OF THESE SIEVE ELEMENTS,
LIKE


395
0:29:54,909 --> 0:29:59,169
SO I AM GOING TO TAKE THIS ERASER AND TURN
IT SO YOU


396
0:29:59,169 --> 0:30:2,399
CAN LOOK AT THIS END WALL OF THE SIEVE ELEMENT.
IF


397
0:30:2,399 --> 0:30:5,419
 YOU COULD LOOK AT THIS END WALL, THAT IS,
THESE WALLS


398
0:30:5,419 --> 0:30:11,21
HERE, AND ON, YOU WOULD FIND A ROUND PLATE
WITH PORES


399
0:30:11,21 --> 0:30:12,47
IN IT.


400
0:30:12,47 --> 0:30:14,45
THIS IS CALLED THE SIEVE PLATE. IT LOOKS LIKE


401
0:30:14,45 --> 0:30:20,49
A SIEVE. THIS IS THE BASIS FOR THE NAME SIEVE


402
0:30:20,49 --> 0:30:21,85
ELEMENTS.


403
0:30:21,85 --> 0:30:24,46
HOW DOES THIS SIEVE ELEMENT FORM?


404
0:30:24,46 --> 0:30:28,82
WELL THE VERY FIRST THING WE HAVE TO SAY IS


405
0:30:28,82 --> 0:30:32,409
UNLIKE THE XYLEM, WHICH IS DEAD WHEN FUNCTIONAL,
THE


406
0:30:32,409 --> 0:30:37,59
PHLOEM IS ALIVE WHEN FUNCTIONAL. ALIVE WHEN


407
0:30:37,59 --> 0:30:39,19
FUNCTIONAL.


408
0:30:39,19 --> 0:30:45,559
THIS CREATES SOME PROBLEMS. IF THESE CELLS
ARE


409
0:30:45,559 --> 0:30:48,69
ALIVE WHEN FUNCTIONAL THAT MEANS THEY HAVE
CYTOPLASM


410
0:30:48,69 --> 0:30:52,8
AND NUCLEUS AND ALL THEIR ORGANELLES, HOW
WILL THEY BE


411
0:30:52,8 --> 0:30:55,33
ABLE TO TRANSPORT LOTS OF NUTRIENTS FROM ONE
END OF


412
0:30:55,33 --> 0:30:57,309
THE PLANT TO THE OTHER? WOULDN'T THAT GET
ALL MIXED


413
0:30:57,309 --> 0:31:0,679
UP WITH THE CYTOPLASM. WOULDN'T THE CYTOPLASM
KIND OF


414
0:31:0,679 --> 0:31:3,65
CLOG IT UP AND PREVENT VERY EFFICIENT TRANSPORT?
IN


415
0:31:3,65 --> 0:31:7,25
 ORDER TO APPRECIATE HOW THE SIEVE ELEMENT
WORKS, EVEN


416
0:31:7,25 --> 0:31:9,72
THOUGH IT IS STILL ALIVE, I WANT TO TALK TO
YOU ABOUT


417
0:31:9,72 --> 0:31:13,34
ITS ORIGIN, AND YOU WILL GET A FEELING FOR
THAT. HERE


418
0:31:13,34 --> 0:31:21,95
IS THE SIEVE ELEMENT, MOTHER CELL. WITH TIME,
AND IT


419
0:31:21,95 --> 0:31:29,35
HAS A NUCLEUS IN IT, WITH TIME, WE GET A DIVISION
OF


420
0:31:29,35 --> 0:31:31,73
THE SIEVE ELEMENT MOTHER CELL.


421
0:31:31,73 --> 0:31:34,82
BUT, IT IS NOT AN EQUAL DIVISION. IT IS UNEQUAL


422
0:31:34,82 --> 0:31:40,2
DIVISION. A DIVISION. AND THEN WE HAVE A NUCLEUS


423
0:31:40,2 --> 0:31:42,83
HERE, TOO.


424
0:31:42,83 --> 0:31:45,309
THESE TWO CELLS ARE GIVEN SPECIAL NAMES. THIS


425
0:31:45,309 --> 0:31:52,83
IS CALLED THE COMPANION CELL. THIS WILL BE
THE NEW


426
0:31:52,83 --> 0:31:53,429
SIEVE ELEMENT.


427
0:31:53,429 --> 0:32:2,51
BUT SOMETHING HAPPENS BECAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT


428
0:32:2,51 --> 0:32:5,19
THE PROBLEM OF HAVING IT CLOGGED UP. SOMETHING


429
0:32:5,19 --> 0:32:11,809
HAPPENED. IN THE FORMATION OF THE SIEVE ELEMENT,
WHAT


430
0:32:11,809 --> 0:32:17,669
WE HAVE HAPPENING IS THAT THE NUCLEUS NOW
OF THE SIEVE


431
0:32:17,669 --> 0:32:20,789
ELEMENT AND OTHER ORGANELLES BEGIN TO DEGENERATE.
SO


432
0:32:20,789 --> 0:32:30,519
WITH TIME WE GET DEGENERATION OF THE SIEVE
ELEMENT


433
0:32:30,519 --> 0:32:37,659
 ULTRA STRUCTURE, SIEVE ELEMENT ORGANELLES.


434
0:32:37,659 --> 0:32:42,39
SO, WE WIND UP WITH TWO CELLS, THE COMPANION


435
0:32:42,39 --> 0:32:47,1
CELL AND THE SIEVE ELEMENT NOW. HERE IS THE
COMPANION


436
0:32:47,1 --> 0:32:52,919
CELL, AND HERE IS THE SIEVE ELEMENT. AND ITS
NUCLEUS


437
0:32:52,919 --> 0:32:56,83
IS GONE. MOST OF ITS ORGANELLES ARE GONE.
BUT IT IS


438
0:32:56,83 --> 0:33:1,34
STILL ALIVE.


439
0:33:1,34 --> 0:33:3,64
NOW, HOW CAN SOMETHING STAY ALIVE IF IT DOESN'T


440
0:33:3,64 --> 0:33:8,519
HAVE A NUCLEUS TO CODE FOR NEW PROTEINS TO
REPAIR OR


441
0:33:8,519 --> 0:33:11,909
CODE FOR OTHER PROTEINS TO WORK ON THE FUNCTION?


442
0:33:11,909 --> 0:33:15,34
THIS IS WHERE THE REAL KIND OF REMARKABLE
LESSON COMES


443
0:33:15,34 --> 0:33:20,49
IN. THOSE ACTIVITIES WHICH NO LONGER CAN BE
CODED FOR


444
0:33:20,49 --> 0:33:23,19
BUT WHICH ARE NECESSARY FOR THE SIEVE ELEMENT
CELL TO


445
0:33:23,19 --> 0:33:27,1
REMAIN ALIVE, THOSE ACTIVITIES ARE TAKEN OVER
BY THE


446
0:33:27,1 --> 0:33:30,88
NUCLEUS OF THE COMPANION CELL. THE COMPANION
CELL


447
0:33:30,88 --> 0:33:33,769
ENCODES FOR MANY OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD
HAVE


448
0:33:33,769 --> 0:33:37,87
GONE ON IN THE NUCLEUS OF THE SIEVE ELEMENT.
WHEN THE


449
0:33:37,87 --> 0:33:43,74
COMPANION CELL DIES, THE SIEVE ELEMENT DIES
AS WELL.


450
0:33:43,74 --> 0:33:48,58
LET ME NOW SHOW YOU SOME PICTURES OF THE VARIOUS
 CELL TYPES WHICH MAKE UP THE VASCULAR TISSUE.


451
0:33:48,58 --> 0:33:49,11
WE WILL


452
0:33:49,11 --> 0:33:52,85
BEGIN WITH THE XYLEM AND I WANT TO AGAIN SHOW
YOU THE


453
0:33:52,85 --> 0:33:56,2
XYLEM CONSISTS OF, IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE,
TRACHEIDS,


454
0:33:56,2 --> 0:33:59,98
WHICH WE SAID ARE ELONGATED CELLS, RELATIVELY
NARROW


455
0:33:59,98 --> 0:34:2,909
AS COMPARED TO VESSEL ELEMENTS OR VESSEL MEMBERS
WHICH


456
0:34:2,909 --> 0:34:6,64
ARE SHORTER CELLS, RELATIVELY WIDER. POINT
WHICH I


457
0:34:6,64 --> 0:34:9,81
DIDN'T MAKE BUT YOU CAN SEE IN THE PICTURES
IS THAT


458
0:34:9,81 --> 0:34:12,5
END WALL OF THE VESSEL ELEMENT IS OPEN. THE
VESSEL


459
0:34:12,5 --> 0:34:17,98
ELEMENT IS OPEN. THERE IS NO OPENING ON THE
TRACHEID


460
0:34:17,98 --> 0:34:20,669
ELEMENTS BUT COMMUNICATION OCCURS THROUGH
SMALLER


461
0:34:20,669 --> 0:34:24,7
HOLES WHICH ARE KNOWN AS PITS. IF WE LOOK
AT HOW


462
0:34:24,7 --> 0:34:28,329
VESSEL FORMS, AGAIN WE HAVE A LIVING SERIES
OF XYLEM


463
0:34:28,329 --> 0:34:33,5
CELLS WHICH IN TIME ELONGATE AND THEN THE
NUCLEUS AND


464
0:34:33,5 --> 0:34:36,72
CYTOPLASM UNDERGO PROGRAM CELL DEATH AND THE
END WALL


465
0:34:36,72 --> 0:34:39,599
BEGINS TO DISSOLVE AWAY BEFORE THE CELL COMPLETELY


466
0:34:39,599 --> 0:34:42,76
DIED UNTIL WE PRODUCE THIS TUBE, THIS TUBE
WHICH


467
0:34:42,76 --> 0:34:45,26
REPRESENTS THE VESSEL.


468
0:34:45,26 --> 0:34:49,3
THE NEXT SLIDE WILL SHOW YOU SCANNING
 ELECTROMICROGRAPH PICTURE OF A POINT WHERE


469
0:34:49,3 --> 0:34:50,26
TWO VESSEL


470
0:34:50,26 --> 0:34:52,919
ELEMENTS ARE MEETING. THIS WOULD BE THE POINT
WHERE


471
0:34:52,919 --> 0:34:56,679
THE TWO MEET AND IT IS AN OPEN PORE WHICH
ALLOWS WATER


472
0:34:56,679 --> 0:34:59,78
TO MOVE AT VERY HIGH VELOCITIES THROUGH THE
VESSEL.


473
0:34:59,78 --> 0:35:2,16
HERE IS A VESSEL ELEMENT, WHICH HAS BEEN DISSECTED


474
0:35:2,16 --> 0:35:5,579
OUT, YOU CAN SEE IT HAS ROUND AND THIS WOULD
BE THE


475
0:35:5,579 --> 0:35:8,9
OPENING IN ITS WALLS. THERE ALSO CAN BE COMMUNICATION


476
0:35:8,9 --> 0:35:11,43
BETWEEN TRACHEIDS AND VESSEL ELEMENTS THROUGH


477
0:35:11,43 --> 0:35:13,859
SIDEWALLS, THROUGH PITS, WHICH WE DIDN'T TALK
ABOUT.


478
0:35:13,859 --> 0:35:17,99
NOW, HERE IS A SIEVE ELEMENT AND A COMPANION
CELL


479
0:35:17,99 --> 0:35:20,39
SHOWN ON ELECTROMICROGRAPH. FIRST THING TO
POINT OUT


480
0:35:20,39 --> 0:35:24,67
IS THAT THIS IS THE SIEVE ELEMENT AND THE
SIEVE PLATE


481
0:35:24,67 --> 0:35:28,7
IS LOCATED HERE, HERE IS ANOTHER SIEVE ELEMENT
HERE.


482
0:35:28,7 --> 0:35:33,6
SO, WHEN WE HAVE A GROUP OF SIEVE ELEMENTS
ALL HOOKED


483
0:35:33,6 --> 0:35:36,4
UP TOGETHER WE CALL THIS A SIEVE TUBE. A SIEVE
TUBE.


484
0:35:36,4 --> 0:35:40,339
WHEN ALL SIEVE ELEMENTS ARE HOOKED UP TOGETHER.
NOW


485
0:35:40,339 --> 0:35:42,77
WHAT I WANT YOU TO NOTICE FROM THIS ONE IS
THERE IS


486
0:35:42,77 --> 0:35:45,92
DENSELY CYTOPLASMIC CELL NEXT TO IT. THIS
IS THE


487
0:35:45,92 --> 0:35:49,24
 COMPANION CELL. NOTICE RELATIVE TO COMPANION
THE CELL,


488
0:35:49,24 --> 0:35:52,91
WHICH HAS HIGH LEVELS OF CYTOPLASM, THAT THE
SIEVE


489
0:35:52,91 --> 0:35:56,1
TUBE MEMBER IS RELATIVELY EMPTY, AS FAR AS
HAVING


490
0:35:56,1 --> 0:35:58,859
CONTENTS, BUT IT IS STILL ALIVE. IT STILL
HAS ITS


491
0:35:58,859 --> 0:36:3,22
MEMBRANES. NOW IF WE PUT OUR EYE AT THIS END
AND LOOK


492
0:36:3,22 --> 0:36:6,19
AT THE SIEVE PLATE, WE SEE THE SIEVE PLATE
HERE. THIS


493
0:36:6,19 --> 0:36:8,829
IS WHAT YOU WOULD LOOK AT. THERE WOULD BE
ONE SIEVE


494
0:36:8,829 --> 0:36:11,13
ELEMENT GOING INTO THE AUDIENCE AND ANOTHER
ONE BEHIND


495
0:36:11,13 --> 0:36:14,42
THE BOARD. AND I WANTED TO SHOW YOU A SIEVE
UNDER


496
0:36:14,42 --> 0:36:17,42
ELECTRON MICROSCOPE. THIS MAY NOT BE A TRUE
PICTURE,


497
0:36:17,42 --> 0:36:20,57
BUT THERE ARE PORES, THESE ARE THE DIFFERENT
PORES IN


498
0:36:20,57 --> 0:36:24,74
THE SIEVE PLATE. JUST TO SHOW YOU THE SERIES
IN THE


499
0:36:24,74 --> 0:36:27,64
PRODUCTION OF THE SIEVE ELEMENT, WHICH MAKES
SIEVE


500
0:36:27,64 --> 0:36:31,27
TUBE. HERE IS A MATURE SIEVE TUBE WHERE WE
HAVE THE


501
0:36:31,27 --> 0:36:33,41
SIEVE PLATES OF THE INDIVIDUAL SIEVE ELEMENTS.
HERE


502
0:36:33,41 --> 0:36:37,1
WOULD BE COMPANION CELL NEXT TO THE SIEVE
ELEMENT. IF


503
0:36:37,1 --> 0:36:40,24
WE FOLLOW ITS PRODUCTION WE START OUT WITH
A MOTHER


504
0:36:40,24 --> 0:36:43,52
CELL WHICH UNDERGOES AN ASYMMETRIC DIVISION,
AND THAT


505
0:36:43,52 --> 0:36:46,39
 ASYMMETRIC DIVISION, IN THIS CASE, RESULTS
IN


506
0:36:46,39 --> 0:36:49,339
COMPANION CELL AND A CELL WHICH WILL BECOME
THE


507
0:36:49,339 --> 0:36:53,49
SIEVE-TWO MEMBER. ITS NUCLEUS WILL BEGIN TO
DEGRADE


508
0:36:53,49 --> 0:36:55,49
AND MOST OF THE CYTOPLASM WILL BEGIN TO DEGRADE
AND


509
0:36:55,49 --> 0:36:58,47
SOMETIMES THE COMPANION CELLS DIVIDE AGAIN.
BUT THE


510
0:36:58,47 --> 0:37:1,56
POINT IS, THAT THERE IS NO LONGER ANY NUCLEUS
IN THE


511
0:37:1,56 --> 0:37:5,119
SIEVE-TWO, BUT IT IS STILL ALIVE.


512
0:37:5,119 --> 0:37:8,67
THESE ARE THE ELEMENT WHICH MAKE UP THE VASCULAR


513
0:37:8,67 --> 0:37:12,89
TISSUE. FINALLY, BEFORE I LEAVE TALKING ABOUT
THE


514
0:37:12,89 --> 0:37:15,64
CELL TYPES OF THE PRIMARY PLANT BODY, I WANT
TO


515
0:37:15,64 --> 0:37:18,75
INTRODUCE YOU TO THE LAST CELL TYPE. AGAIN
WHICH MOST


516
0:37:18,75 --> 0:37:23,79
OF YOU HAVE HAD CONTACT WITH. THAT LAST CELL
TYPE WE


517
0:37:23,79 --> 0:37:29,78
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THE EPIDERMIS. THE EPIDERMIS
IS


518
0:37:29,78 --> 0:37:37,41
OUTER-MOST LAYER OF THE PLANT.


519
0:37:37,41 --> 0:37:45,91
OF THE PRIMARY PLANT BODY.


520
0:37:45,91 --> 0:37:48,29
AS A CONSEQUENCE, IT'S THE FIRST LAYER TO


521
0:37:48,29 --> 0:37:50,71
ENCOUNTER ALL THE DIFFICULTIES WITH THE EXTERNAL


522
0:37:50,71 --> 0:37:54,96
ENVIRONMENT; POLLUTION, ATTACK BY DISEASE,
ATTACK BY


523
0:37:54,96 --> 0:37:59,18
 ANIMALS, THESE ARE ALL ENVIRONMENTAL INSULTS
THAT THE


524
0:37:59,18 --> 0:38:2,4
EPIDERMIS ENCOUNTERS FIRST. EPIDERMAL CELLS
ARE


525
0:38:2,4 --> 0:38:4,869
DIFFERENT FROM ALL OTHER CELLS IN THE PLANT,
BECAUSE


526
0:38:4,869 --> 0:38:7,97
THEY ARE NOT SURROUNDED ON ALL SIDES BY CELLS.
ONLY


527
0:38:7,97 --> 0:38:10,81
ON THEIR SIDE AND BOTTOM ARE THEY SURROUNDED
BY THE


528
0:38:10,81 --> 0:38:13,369
CELLS. BUT, ON ONE SURFACE THEY ARE COMPLETELY


529
0:38:13,369 --> 0:38:17,69
EXPOSED TO THE OUTSIDE. SO THEY DIFFER FROM
OTHER


530
0:38:17,69 --> 0:38:20,96
CELLS IN THE PLANT. NOW, BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT
THE


531
0:38:20,96 --> 0:38:27,79
LAYER OF PROTECTION FOR THE PLANT


532
0:38:27,79 --> 0:38:28,39
THEY DEVELOPED


533
0:38:28,39 --> 0:38:31,48
A NUMBER OF CHARACTERISTICS WHICH ALLOW THEM
TO RESIST


534
0:38:31,48 --> 0:38:34,95
THE ENVIRONMENTAL INSULTS WHICH ALLOW THEM
TO RETARD


535
0:38:34,95 --> 0:38:38,91
SOME INSECT AND ANIMAL ATTACKS AND ALSO PERDATION
BY


536
0:38:38,91 --> 0:38:43,0
VARIOUS DISEASES. THE FIRST WAY IN WHICH EPIDERMAL


537
0:38:43,0 --> 0:38:47,24
CELLS RESIST IN ALLOWING PATHOGENS OR POLLUTANTS
TO


538
0:38:47,24 --> 0:38:51,45
ENTER INTO THE PLANT IS THAT THE CELLS OF
THE


539
0:38:51,45 --> 0:39:3,2
EPIDERMIS ARE VERY TIGHTLY JOINED TO EACH
OTHER.


540
0:39:3,2 --> 0:39:9,359
SO IF YOU COULD LOOK AT AN EPIDERMAL CELL,
IT


541
0:39:9,359 --> 0:39:12,39
ALMOST LOOKS LIKE A PUZZLE. WHERE YOU WOULD
HAVE


542
0:39:12,39 --> 0:39:17,46
 CELLS THAT ARE VERY TIGHTLY JOINED SO THAT
THERE ARE


543
0:39:17,46 --> 0:39:21,44
NO SPACES BETWEEN THE CELLS. SO THEY HAVE
TIGHT


544
0:39:21,44 --> 0:39:24,57
JUNCTIONS. THE SECOND WAY IN WHICH EPIDERMAL
CELLS


545
0:39:24,57 --> 0:39:28,9
OFFER PROTECTION IS ILLUSTRATED BY THIS APPLE.


546
0:39:28,9 --> 0:39:32,24
THIS APPLE HAS AN EPIDERMIS ON IT AND THOSE
OF


547
0:39:32,24 --> 0:39:34,32
YOU WHO HAD TEACHERS WHO YOU WERE TRYING TO
IMPRESS


548
0:39:34,32 --> 0:39:36,57
WHEN YOU WERE KIDS YOU USED TO BRING AN APPLE,
PERHAPS


549
0:39:36,57 --> 0:39:38,82
INTO THE TEACHER. BEFORE YOU BROUGHT IT IN
YOU RUBBED


550
0:39:38,82 --> 0:39:42,99
IT AGAINST YOUR SHIRT. THE APPLE BECAME SHINY.
THE


551
0:39:42,99 --> 0:39:44,25
REASON THE APPLE BECAME SHINY IS BECAUSE THERE
ARE


552
0:39:44,25 --> 0:39:48,589
WAXES SECRETED TO THE OUTSIDE. SO, THE EPIDERMIS
ALSO


553
0:39:48,589 --> 0:39:55,369
SECRETES WAXES.


554
0:39:55,369 --> 0:39:59,47
THESE WAXES MAKE UP A LAYER OR A THICK LAYER
IN


555
0:39:59,47 --> 0:40:2,98
SOME CASES KNOWN AS THE CUTICLE.


556
0:40:2,98 --> 0:40:3,38
THE CUTICLE.


557
0:40:3,38 --> 0:40:12,65
WHAT DOES THE CUTICLE DO? IT PREVENTS WATER


558
0:40:12,65 --> 0:40:18,9
LOSS. PREVENTS WATER LOSS FROM THE INSIDE.


559
0:40:18,9 --> 0:40:24,109
SO, YOU HAVE A LAYER OF WAX SURROUNDING THAT
 APPLE AND PRESUMABLY THAT APPLE WILL LAST


560
0:40:24,109 --> 0:40:24,869
A LOT


561
0:40:24,869 --> 0:40:28,96
LONGER, BE AVAILABLE A LOT LONGER FOR SOME
ANIMAL TO


562
0:40:28,96 --> 0:40:31,49
DISPERSE THIS FRUIT, BUT IT WILL BE ATTRACTED
TO THIS


563
0:40:31,49 --> 0:40:33,52
FRUIT BECAUSE IT STILL RETAINS ITS TASTE AND
ITS


564
0:40:33,52 --> 0:40:37,49
FLAVOR BECAUSE OF THE CUTICLE. ALL PLANT PARTS,
NOT


565
0:40:37,49 --> 0:40:39,96
THE ROOT SYSTEM, BUT ALL ABOVE GROUND PARTS
GENERALLY


566
0:40:39,96 --> 0:40:43,4
HAVE SOME CUTICLE, SOME WAX SECRETED ON THE
OUTSIDE TO


567
0:40:43,4 --> 0:40:46,599
RETARD WATER LOSS. NOW, LET'S PRETEND LIKE
THIS


568
0:40:46,599 --> 0:40:50,5
BLACKBOARD IS A LEAF. YOU ARE LOOKING DOWN
AT THIS


569
0:40:50,5 --> 0:40:53,15
LEAF. IT IS COVERED WITH CUTICLE. THE PROBLEM
THAT


570
0:40:53,15 --> 0:40:56,74
YOU ALL KNOW ABOUT IS THAT THE LEAF IS ALSO
THE SITE


571
0:40:56,74 --> 0:41:0,13
OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS. AS A RESULT OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS,
WE


572
0:41:0,13 --> 0:41:4,46
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GET CO2 INTO
A LEAF.


573
0:41:4,46 --> 0:41:8,0
HOW DO WE GET CO2 INTO A LEAF, WHICH IS COVERED
BY


574
0:41:8,0 --> 0:41:11,94
A CUTICLE, WHICH IS COVERED BY A LAYER, WHICH
PREVENTS


575
0:41:11,94 --> 0:41:16,4
OR SLOWS DOWN THE MOVEMENT OF GASSES AND WATER?
SO


576
0:41:16,4 --> 0:41:19,9
IF THIS WERE A LEAF, THE WAY THE LEAF DEALS
WITH THIS


577
0:41:19,9 --> 0:41:29,54
PROBLEM, IS IT MAKES PORES. MAKES PORES.
 AND THESE PORES ARE GIVEN A NAME WHICH ARE


578
0:41:29,54 --> 0:41:29,94
KNOWN


579
0:41:29,94 --> 0:41:31,39
AS STOMA.


580
0:41:31,39 --> 0:41:35,75
MAKES PORES OR STOMA.


581
0:41:35,75 --> 0:41:41,26
AND THROUGH THESE PORES CO2 CAN GO IN. THIS
IS


582
0:41:41,26 --> 0:41:45,98
A LEAF WE ARE LOOKING ON, A LEAF SURFACE.
IT MAKES


583
0:41:45,98 --> 0:41:48,31
PORES OR HOLES IN THE CUTICLE. THROUGH THESE
PORES


584
0:41:48,31 --> 0:41:52,67
CO2 CAN GO IN. THERE IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE
AT THE SAME


585
0:41:52,67 --> 0:41:56,48
TIME CO2 GOES IN THE THING THAT THE CUTICLE
IS TRYING


586
0:41:56,48 --> 0:42:2,54
TO PREVENT IS ALSO HAPPENING. WATER IS GOING
OUT.


587
0:42:2,54 --> 0:42:3,16
WATER IS GOING OUT.


588
0:42:3,16 --> 0:42:10,22
SO HOW DOES THE PLANT DEAL WITH THIS SITUATION


589
0:42:10,22 --> 0:42:14,89
THAT IT WANTS CO2 BUT IT DOESN'T WANT TO LOSE
WATER?


590
0:42:14,89 --> 0:42:17,319
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CELL TYPE WHICH DEVELOPS
IN THE


591
0:42:17,319 --> 0:42:21,6
EPIDERMIS. THIS PARTICULAR PORE, WE WILL MAKE
ANOTHER


592
0:42:21,6 --> 0:42:27,91
ONE OVER HERE, THIS PARTICULAR PORE, DEVELOPS
AROUND


593
0:42:27,91 --> 0:42:37,17
IT, SPECIAL CELLS. WHICH ARE KNOWN AS GUARD
CELLS.


594
0:42:37,17 --> 0:42:42,68
THESE GUARD CELLS CONTROL THE SIZE OF THE
PORE.


595
0:42:42,68 --> 0:42:48,13
WE WILL TALK MORE ABOUT HOW THE GUARD CELLS
WORK LATER


596
0:42:48,13 --> 0:42:50,98
 ON. BUT, I WANT YOU TO APPRECIATE THAT THEY
ARE PART


597
0:42:50,98 --> 0:42:59,38
OF THE EPIDERMIS. SO, WE HAVE TWO GUARD CELLS,
WE


598
0:42:59,38 --> 0:43:4,89
HAVE THE PORE, AND TOGETHER THIS WHOLE STRUCTURE
IS


599
0:43:4,89 --> 0:43:9,589
CALLED VARIOUS THINGS BUT THE SIMPLE NAME
IS


600
0:43:9,589 --> 0:43:12,24
A STOMATA. S-T-O-M-A-T-A, STOMATA. OR STOMATA


601
0:43:12,24 --> 0:43:15,819
COMPLEX, DEPENDS ON HOW YOUR BOOK REFERS TO
IT. THESE


602
0:43:15,819 --> 0:43:18,75
ARE MODIFICATIONS OF EPIDERMAL CELL. YOU HAD
A


603
0:43:18,75 --> 0:43:23,569
QUESTION? IS THE CUTICLE A NON-LIVING LAYER?
A VERY


604
0:43:23,569 --> 0:43:26,43
GOOD POINT. THE CUTICLE IS NOT LIVING. IT
IS SECRETED


605
0:43:26,43 --> 0:43:29,69
BY THE LIVING CELLS OF THE EPIDERMIS CELLS
BUT IT IS


606
0:43:29,69 --> 0:43:33,5
NOT LIVING. GOOD QUESTION. FINALLY, WHAT I
WANT TO


607
0:43:33,5 --> 0:43:37,24
MENTION IS, BESIDES MODIFYING THE EPIDERMIS
TO HAVING


608
0:43:37,24 --> 0:43:39,97
A CUTICLE AND HAVING THESE PORES, THERE ARE
A COUPLE


609
0:43:39,97 --> 0:43:42,72
OF OTHER MODIFICATIONS OF THE EPIDERMIS. AND
AGAIN,


610
0:43:42,72 --> 0:43:45,89
THESE ARE USUALLY MEANT TO PROTECT THE PLANT.
ONE


611
0:43:45,89 --> 0:43:48,9
MODIFICATION THAT MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE OF
IS THAT


612
0:43:48,9 --> 0:43:52,99
PLANT SURFACES ARE FREQUENTLY COVERED WITH
HAIRS OR


613
0:43:52,99 --> 0:43:54,359
DIFFERENT TYPES OF THINGS WHICH GROW UP FROM
THE


614
0:43:54,359 --> 0:44:3,49
 SURFACE. THESE HAIRS ARE KNOWN AS TRICHOMES.


615
0:44:3,49 --> 0:44:8,44
THEY ARE EPIDERMAL OUT-GROWTHS.


616
0:44:8,44 --> 0:44:14,6
THEY ARE USUALLY INVOLVED IN PROTECTION. FOR


617
0:44:14,6 --> 0:44:16,819
EXAMPLE, IF A LEAF IS COVERED WITH A SLIGHT
LAYER OF


618
0:44:16,819 --> 0:44:20,2
HAIR THIS MAY ELEVATE AN APHID OR AN INSECT
WHICH MAY


619
0:44:20,2 --> 0:44:22,45
WANTED TO COME IN AND ATTACK THE LEAF. IT
COULDN'T GET


620
0:44:22,45 --> 0:44:25,25
DOWN TO THE LEAF SURFACE BECAUSE IT WAS HELD
AWAY BY


621
0:44:25,25 --> 0:44:26,23
THE HAIRS.


622
0:44:26,23 --> 0:44:28,69
HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF EPIDERMAL HAIR THAT
MANY


623
0:44:28,69 --> 0:44:33,29
OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH, COTTON. COTTON REPRESENTS


624
0:44:33,29 --> 0:44:36,66
EPIDERMAL HAIR WHICH GROWS OUT OF THE SEED
COAT.


625
0:44:36,66 --> 0:44:40,29
EPIDERMAL HAIR GROWING OUT OF THE SEED COAT.
WHY


626
0:44:40,29 --> 0:44:44,29
WOULD COTTON PRODUCE THESE HAIRS. ONE IDEA
IS THIS


627
0:44:44,29 --> 0:44:47,4
MAKES SEED ATTRACTIVE TO ANIMALS TO USE FOR
THEIR


628
0:44:47,4 --> 0:44:50,39
NESTS. AND AS A RESULT, THEY DISPERSE SEEDS
AS


629
0:44:50,39 --> 0:44:53,75
A RESULT OF COLLECTING THE COTTON AND LINING
THEIR


630
0:44:53,75 --> 0:44:55,819
NESTS AND LATER ON THE SEEDS GET A CHANCE
TO


631
0:44:55,819 --> 0:44:59,4
GERMINATE.
 HERE IS AN EPIDERMAL HAIR WHICH WE AS HUMANS


632
0:44:59,4 --> 0:45:2,77
HAVE EXPLOITED GREATLY. OTHER REASON WHY PLANT
PRODUCE


633
0:45:2,77 --> 0:45:9,51
EPIDERMAL HAIRS IS OFTEN TO REFLECT LIGHT.
LIGHT CAN


634
0:45:9,51 --> 0:45:13,16
BE VERY DAMAGING TO PLANTS AND AS A RESULT
THE


635
0:45:13,16 --> 0:45:16,54
PRODUCTION OF EPIDERMAL HAIRS CAN CAUSE THE
LIGHT TO


636
0:45:16,54 --> 0:45:18,569
BE REFLECTED AWAY. AND I WILL SHOW YOU A PICTURE
OF


637
0:45:18,569 --> 0:45:21,38
THIS IN A MOMENT. FINALLY, EPIDERMAL HAIRS
ON THE


638
0:45:21,38 --> 0:45:24,71
SHOOT SYSTEM ARE EASILY FOUND BY MOST OF YOU.
IF YOU


639
0:45:24,71 --> 0:45:27,3
HAVE EVER TAKEN A GERANIUM AND RUN YOUR HAND
AND


640
0:45:27,3 --> 0:45:29,68
CRUSHED THE LEAF VERY SLIGHTLY, YOU WILL HAVE
A SMELL,


641
0:45:29,68 --> 0:45:32,18
YOU CAN LEAVE THE LIGHTS ON FOR A FEW MINUTES,
YOU


642
0:45:32,18 --> 0:45:35,39
WILL HAVE A SMELL ON THE LEAF, AND THAT SMELL
COMES


643
0:45:35,39 --> 0:45:38,0
ACROSS ON TO YOUR FINGERS. THAT IS BECAUSE
OF


644
0:45:38,0 --> 0:45:39,29
EPIDERMAL GLAND CELLS.


645
0:45:39,29 --> 0:45:48,869
I WILL SHOW YOU A PICTURE OF THAT IN A MOMENT.


646
0:45:48,869 --> 0:45:51,28
FINALLY, THE LAST MODIFICATION OF THE EPIDERMIS


647
0:45:51,28 --> 0:45:54,2
THAT I WANT TO POINT OUT TO YOU IS NOT FOUND
IN THE


648
0:45:54,2 --> 0:46:6,4
SHOOT SYSTEM, BUT IN THE ROOT SYSTEM.
 
AND THIS IS THE, LET'S PRETEND THIS IS THE


649
0:46:6,4 --> 0:46:14,869
EPIDERMIS OF THE ROOT. THIS IS THE ROOT EPIDERMIS.


650
0:46:14,869 --> 0:46:19,329
SOME ROOT EPIDERMAL CELLS WE WILL FIND DEVELOP


651
0:46:19,329 --> 0:46:28,92
OUT-GROWTH. WHICH IS KNOWN AS A ROOT HAIR.
THIS ACTS


652
0:46:28,92 --> 0:46:39,96
TO INCREASE WATER AND NUTRIENT UPTAKE BY THE
ROOT


653
0:46:39,96 --> 0:46:43,48
BECAUSE IT PROVIDES AN INCREASE SURFACE AREA
FOR


654
0:46:43,48 --> 0:46:47,22
TAKING UP WATER AND NUTRIENTS. SO, THE ROOT
HAIR IS


655
0:46:47,22 --> 0:46:50,579
ALSO EPIDERMAL OUT-GROWTH OR EPIDERMAL MODIFICATION


656
0:46:50,579 --> 0:46:55,579
WHICH COMES FROM THE OUT-GROWTH OF AN EPIDERMAL
CELL.


657
0:46:55,579 --> 0:46:58,24
AGAIN, PROBABLY IT WOULD NOT THE EFFICIENT
FOR ROOTS


658
0:46:58,24 --> 0:47:1,599
TO HAVE A CUTICLE IN THEM BECAUSE THEY FUNCTION
IN


659
0:47:1,599 --> 0:47:5,109
WATER UPTAKE. OKAY, WE CAN DO THE SLIDES NOW.
FIRST


660
0:47:5,109 --> 0:47:7,88
SLIDE I WANT TO SHOW YOU IS OF THE CUTICLE.
SECTION


661
0:47:7,88 --> 0:47:11,109
OF A LEAF AND I WANT TO POINT OUT TO YOU EPIDERMIS
AND


662
0:47:11,109 --> 0:47:14,17
ALSO POINT OUT TO YOU THE CUTICLE. HERE IS
THE


663
0:47:14,17 --> 0:47:16,48
EPIDERMIS, THESE SMALL CELLS HERE. AND THESE
ARE


664
0:47:16,48 --> 0:47:18,38
PARENCHYMA CELLS UNDERNEATH. AND HERE YOU
CAN SEE


665
0:47:18,38 --> 0:47:20,95
THIS LAYER OF WAX, LAYER OF CUTICLE WHICH
IS


666
0:47:20,95 --> 0:47:24,64
 A NON-LIVING LAYER SECRETED BY THE UNDERLYING


667
0:47:24,64 --> 0:47:27,849
EPIDERMAL CELLS. WE ARE LOOKING DOWN ON THE
SURFACE


668
0:47:27,849 --> 0:47:30,68
OF A LEAF. PRETEND LIKE THIS WAS THE BLACKBOARD.
HERE


669
0:47:30,68 --> 0:47:33,809
YOU CAN SEE THE VERY TIGHTLY JOINED EPIDERMAL
CELLS


670
0:47:33,809 --> 0:47:36,44
BUT OCCASIONALLY SOME OF EPIDERMAL CELLS ARE


671
0:47:36,44 --> 0:47:38,7
ASSOCIATED WITH THE STOMATA COMPLEX.


672
0:47:38,7 --> 0:47:41,41
HERE IS THE PORE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE.


673
0:47:41,41 --> 0:47:44,22
HERE ARE THE TWO GUARD CELLS, WHICH CONTROL
THE SIZE


674
0:47:44,22 --> 0:47:48,93
OF THE PORE. ANOTHER, MAYBE A CLOSER LARGER
EXAMPLE OF


675
0:47:48,93 --> 0:47:52,69
THE GUARD CELL. AGAIN THE PORE AND THESE TWO
GUARD


676
0:47:52,69 --> 0:47:54,809
CELLS AND OTHER REGULAR EPIDERMAL CELLS SURROUNDING


677
0:47:54,809 --> 0:47:57,71
IT. THIS IS A SCANNING ELECTROMICROSCOPE PICTURE
OF


678
0:47:57,71 --> 0:48:1,559
AN EPIDERMAL CELL, OF A STOMATA COMPLEX CELL
AND HERE


679
0:48:1,559 --> 0:48:4,59
YOU CAN SEE THE PORE AND THE TWO GUARD CELLS
ON EITHER


680
0:48:4,59 --> 0:48:7,53
SIDE, WHICH FUNCTION TO DETERMINE THE SIZE
OF THE


681
0:48:7,53 --> 0:48:11,119
OPENING. LAST FEW SLIDES I WANT TO SHOW YOU
ARE CELLS


682
0:48:11,119 --> 0:48:14,339
THAT ALL OF YOU HAVE USED BEFORE. THESE ARE
CELLS


683
0:48:14,339 --> 0:48:17,7
WHICH ARE GLANDULAR HAIRS. THEY SECRETE A
MATERIALS.


684
0:48:17,7 --> 0:48:22,59
 THEY ALSO, BY HAVING SHARP POINTS ON THEM,
CAN ACT TO


685
0:48:22,59 --> 0:48:25,5
INJECT TOXINS INTO ANIMALS THAT MIGHT COME
AND FEED ON


686
0:48:25,5 --> 0:48:27,91
THE PLANT. SO, SOME OF THE HAIRS THAT YOU
GET ON YOUR


687
0:48:27,91 --> 0:48:31,16
HAND WHEN YOU TOUCH A PLANT ARE ACTUALLY CONTAINING


688
0:48:31,16 --> 0:48:34,79
TOXINS FROM THE EPIDERMIS. HERE IS GLANDULAR
HAIR


689
0:48:34,79 --> 0:48:38,54
WITH THE SOLUTION ON THE TOP. HERE IS ANOTHER
ONE. WE


690
0:48:38,54 --> 0:48:40,64
HAVE BROKEN OFF THE TIP OF THE GLAND AND NOW
THE


691
0:48:40,64 --> 0:48:43,99
SOLUTION IS COMING OUT. THIS MAY BE TOXIC
AND


692
0:48:43,99 --> 0:48:47,619
FRAGRANT IN SOME WAY. HERE IS COTTON. AGAIN,
COTTON


693
0:48:47,619 --> 0:48:50,5
REPRESENTS OUT-GROWTH OF HAIRS FROM THE EPIDERMIS
OF


694
0:48:50,5 --> 0:48:52,77
THE SEED COAT AND HERE IS A PICTURE OF THE
VERY


695
0:48:52,77 --> 0:48:55,829
BEGINNING, HERE IS THE EPIDERMIS OF THE SEED.
THE


696
0:48:55,829 --> 0:48:58,609
SEED WOULD BE DOWN HERE. AND HERE ARE THE
EPIDERMAL


697
0:48:58,609 --> 0:49:1,319
HAIRS GROWING OUT AND THEY GET TO BE VERY
LONG. THEY


698
0:49:1,319 --> 0:49:3,839
ARE JUST A SINGLE CELL. AND FINALLY, THIS
LAST SLIDE


699
0:49:3,839 --> 0:49:6,96
IS KIND OF AN INTERESTING SLIDE I WANTED TO
SHOW YOU.


700
0:49:6,96 --> 0:49:10,579
THIS SLIDE IS TAKEN IN THE ANDES ABOUT 15,000
FEET IN


701
0:49:10,579 --> 0:49:13,88
ELEVATION. AND AT THAT ELEVATION LIGHT IS
EXTREMELY


702
0:49:13,88 --> 0:49:16,109
 BRIGHT AND CAN BE EXTREMELY DAMAGING TO
THE


703
0:49:16,109 --> 0:49:18,92
PHOTOSYNTHETIC APPARATUS. THIS IS A MAN OBVIOUSLY


704
0:49:18,92 --> 0:49:22,5
STANDING HERE AND THIS IS A CACTUS. THIS CACTUS
IS


705
0:49:22,5 --> 0:49:24,809
COVERED ITSELF WITH EPIDERMAL HAIRS, WITH
EPIDERMAL


706
0:49:24,809 --> 0:49:29,99
OUT-GROWTH TO REFLECT THE LIGHT AND ALSO TO
SLOW DOWN


707
0:49:29,99 --> 0:49:32,369
THE LOSS OF WATER IN THIS VERY DRY ENVIRONMENT.
