1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:9,78



2
0:0:9,78 --> 0:0:10,269
MALE SPEAKER: What's up?


3
0:0:10,269 --> 0:0:12,225
We're at Burnside.


4
0:0:12,225 --> 0:0:14,181
Pretty sick session.


5
0:0:14,181 --> 0:0:17,115
Rick McCrank, going off.


6
0:0:17,115 --> 0:0:20,855
And we're going to talk to
Julien, Cardiel, Q, who's a


7
0:0:20,855 --> 0:0:23,4
local here, ask them
some cool stuff.


8
0:0:23,4 --> 0:0:25,872
Anyway, pretty psyched.


9
0:0:25,872 --> 0:0:30,222
It's like a historical meeting
of the minds on skateboards.


10
0:0:30,222 --> 0:0:31,472
MALE SPEAKER: Here he goes.


11
0:0:31,472 --> 0:0:35,42



12
0:0:35,42 --> 0:0:36,292
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Nice.


13
0:0:36,292 --> 0:0:39,87



14
0:0:39,87 --> 0:0:40,59
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
[INAUDIBLE] is


15
0:0:40,59 --> 0:0:41,84
a constant at Burnside.


16
0:0:41,84 --> 0:0:44,45



17
0:0:44,45 --> 0:0:45,86
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): You
should have been here earlier


18
0:0:45,86 --> 0:0:48,21
when we were here.


19
0:0:48,21 --> 0:0:50,821
MALE SPEAKER: Got to say I
scratched it at least.


20
0:0:50,821 --> 0:0:51,67
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Weren't you here at five in


21
0:0:51,67 --> 0:0:52,36
the morning?


22
0:0:52,36 --> 0:0:52,49
MIKE CARROLL: I scratched
this earlier.


23
0:0:52,49 --> 0:0:55,1
MALE SPEAKER: Since I missed
the 6:00 AM session.


24
0:0:55,1 --> 0:0:57,92
MALE SPEAKER: You came at
the 6:00 AM session?


25
0:0:57,92 --> 0:0:58,64
MIKE CARROLL: Yeah.


26
0:0:58,64 --> 0:0:59,36
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
All gayed up?


27
0:0:59,36 --> 0:1:0,286
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
What brought that on?


28
0:1:0,286 --> 0:1:7,298



29
0:1:7,298 --> 0:1:13,65
[CHEERING]


30
0:1:13,65 --> 0:1:14,6
PAT QUIRK: Yeah, man!


31
0:1:14,6 --> 0:1:14,68
That's good dude.


32
0:1:14,68 --> 0:1:15,82
Way to rip it man.


33
0:1:15,82 --> 0:1:17,82
Kill it, man.


34
0:1:17,82 --> 0:1:21,375
Wow, I see it can be done now
after seeing that guy do it.


35
0:1:21,375 --> 0:1:23,275
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
So how long has


36
0:1:23,275 --> 0:1:24,7
Burnside been goin'?


37
0:1:24,7 --> 0:1:27,28
PAT QUIRK: I think since
1991 or something.


38
0:1:27,28 --> 0:1:29,34
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): It
was originally just a bank?


39
0:1:29,34 --> 0:1:31,53
PAT QUIRK: Yeah, it was
that bank up there.


40
0:1:31,53 --> 0:1:34,44
That thing just didn't have
any tranny at the bottom.


41
0:1:34,44 --> 0:1:34,65
It just kind of went
down to like a--


42
0:1:34,65 --> 0:1:36,72
[FFFT].


43
0:1:36,72 --> 0:1:40,4
There was two little banks they
built side to side on the


44
0:1:40,4 --> 0:1:44,82
big things so you could go
from one to the other.


45
0:1:44,82 --> 0:1:47,21
Kick turn, or some people
would fakey slide.


46
0:1:47,21 --> 0:1:49,98
It actually was very
hard to do.


47
0:1:49,98 --> 0:1:52,52
Really, Burnside brought a lot
of heads together that didn't


48
0:1:52,52 --> 0:1:55,59
get along with each other, and
they eventually had to work


49
0:1:55,59 --> 0:1:56,84
with each other.


50
0:1:56,84 --> 0:1:59,12
Became like a new generation.


51
0:1:59,12 --> 0:2:2,33
Yeah, the park actually helped
unite a lot of people, is what


52
0:2:2,33 --> 0:2:3,504
I'm trying to say.


53
0:2:3,504 --> 0:2:5,23
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): You
remember Julien when he first


54
0:2:5,23 --> 0:2:6,24
started coming out?


55
0:2:6,24 --> 0:2:7,52
PAT QUIRK: I think so, man.


56
0:2:7,52 --> 0:2:10,22
I go hey, where you from, and
he goes, I'm from the coast.


57
0:2:10,22 --> 0:2:11,0
And I always thought
he was from the


58
0:2:11,0 --> 0:2:12,82
Oregon coast, but wherever.


59
0:2:12,82 --> 0:2:15,245
I remember people by their faces
more than their names,


60
0:2:15,245 --> 0:2:17,73
because I know hundreds of
thousands of people.


61
0:2:17,73 --> 0:2:19,589
I can't remember everybody's
name.


62
0:2:19,589 --> 0:2:24,858



63
0:2:24,858 --> 0:2:26,78
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
You come up here a lot?


64
0:2:26,78 --> 0:2:28,6
JULIEN STRANGER: Not really.


65
0:2:28,6 --> 0:2:30,72
Not much.


66
0:2:30,72 --> 0:2:32,6
At least a couple
times a summer.


67
0:2:32,6 --> 0:2:35,89
But we used to just stay here.


68
0:2:35,89 --> 0:2:37,8
Live here, kind of.


69
0:2:37,8 --> 0:2:38,71
JOHN CARDIEL: Actually, there
was dirt over there in that


70
0:2:38,71 --> 0:2:41,6
field, and we used to
fucking sleep on


71
0:2:41,6 --> 0:2:43,41
cardboard boxes and shit.


72
0:2:43,41 --> 0:2:44,62
It was so raw, dude.


73
0:2:44,62 --> 0:2:46,15
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
No tents or anything?


74
0:2:46,15 --> 0:2:46,7
JOHN CARDIEL: No.


75
0:2:46,7 --> 0:2:48,73
Pre-tent years.


76
0:2:48,73 --> 0:2:50,2
Cardboard box on the ground.


77
0:2:50,2 --> 0:2:52,18
If you had a sleeping
bag, maybe fight


78
0:2:52,18 --> 0:2:54,535
somebody for a car.


79
0:2:54,535 --> 0:2:56,2
Was about the best
you could do.


80
0:2:56,2 --> 0:2:57,45
Was nasty, though.


81
0:2:57,45 --> 0:3:2,51



82
0:3:2,51 --> 0:3:5,49
I came here when the first
bowl was here.


83
0:3:5,49 --> 0:3:6,55
I came up here snowboarding
on Mt.


84
0:3:6,55 --> 0:3:7,4
Hood one time.


85
0:3:7,4 --> 0:3:9,0
It was just one bowl.


86
0:3:9,0 --> 0:3:11,43
And then now it's fucking
just advanced into the


87
0:3:11,43 --> 0:3:12,94
gnarliest shit ever.


88
0:3:12,94 --> 0:3:14,276
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): I
remember in the spitfire


89
0:3:14,276 --> 0:3:17,28
video, it was just that quarter
coming up the bank.


90
0:3:17,28 --> 0:3:17,99
JOHN CARDIEL: Yeah.


91
0:3:17,99 --> 0:3:18,92
They had the love seat.


92
0:3:18,92 --> 0:3:21,1
It was hella love.


93
0:3:21,1 --> 0:3:23,9
But it's always been hella
love up here in fucking


94
0:3:23,9 --> 0:3:24,34
Burnside, man.


95
0:3:24,34 --> 0:3:33,95



96
0:3:33,95 --> 0:3:35,1
PAT QUIRK: Yeah, I
remember Cardiel.


97
0:3:35,1 --> 0:3:38,62
That guy was always coming up
to Portland and do just some


98
0:3:38,62 --> 0:3:42,33
crazy ass shit that
nobody did here.


99
0:3:42,33 --> 0:3:44,305
He actually was a pretty
humble guy, too, and


100
0:3:44,305 --> 0:3:45,27
everybody liked him.


101
0:3:45,27 --> 0:3:48,1
And people look up to that
dude as being one of the


102
0:3:48,1 --> 0:3:49,7
leaders of skateboarding
at that time.


103
0:3:49,7 --> 0:3:51,6
And one of the most
radical people.


104
0:3:51,6 --> 0:3:57,68



105
0:3:57,68 --> 0:3:59,97
If you look at it, it's almost
like a jigsaw puzzle because


106
0:3:59,97 --> 0:4:2,22
it's all these little
sections.


107
0:4:2,22 --> 0:4:5,16
The concrete guys would come by
here with the trucks, and


108
0:4:5,16 --> 0:4:7,69
if they had extra mud they'd
drop it off here.


109
0:4:7,69 --> 0:4:11,57
A lot of it was donations, or
just people that skated


110
0:4:11,57 --> 0:4:13,87
putting their money together,
and we'd get enough money to


111
0:4:13,87 --> 0:4:16,51
build another section.


112
0:4:16,51 --> 0:4:18,591
Really, it's like a
patchwork quilt.


113
0:4:18,591 --> 0:4:19,22
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Seems a lot


114
0:4:19,22 --> 0:4:20,315
easier to skate now.


115
0:4:20,315 --> 0:4:20,746
JULIEN STRANGER: Much.


116
0:4:20,746 --> 0:4:21,649
Much smoother.


117
0:4:21,649 --> 0:4:22,14
Yeah.


118
0:4:22,14 --> 0:4:24,454
But then, wheels were bigger,
so, you know.


119
0:4:24,454 --> 0:4:25,32
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Wheels were bigger then?


120
0:4:25,32 --> 0:4:27,17
JULIEN STRANGER: Yeah.


121
0:4:27,17 --> 0:4:28,79
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): The
first time I came here it


122
0:4:28,79 --> 0:4:31,982
seemed so rough that I was like,
how do people-- like I


123
0:4:31,982 --> 0:4:34,439
saw some of the videos and I was
like, oh, it's going to be


124
0:4:34,439 --> 0:4:36,78
easy, and then you get to--
you're like [BRRRRRRR].


125
0:4:36,78 --> 0:4:38,78
JULIEN STRANGER: Well, you can
see right there, it has a


126
0:4:38,78 --> 0:4:39,49
whole new floor.


127
0:4:39,49 --> 0:4:43,8
But the original Burnside
was on this.


128
0:4:43,8 --> 0:4:47,56
So, this is what it was
for a long time.


129
0:4:47,56 --> 0:4:49,779
Does look like it's in really
good shape right now, though.


130
0:4:49,779 --> 0:4:56,765



131
0:4:56,765 --> 0:5:3,252
[CHEERING]


132
0:5:3,252 --> 0:5:6,22
PAT QUIRK: Burnside's still got
a good feeling to it, man.


133
0:5:6,22 --> 0:5:8,29
It's been around a while,
and it's got roots.


134
0:5:8,29 --> 0:5:10,46
Everybody tries to get along
with other people.


135
0:5:10,46 --> 0:5:13,245
If you can't get along,
go somewhere else.


136
0:5:13,245 --> 0:5:16,285
It's got established ways that
people do business here.


137
0:5:16,285 --> 0:5:18,57
There's things you do, and
there's things you don't do.


138
0:5:18,57 --> 0:5:25,528



139
0:5:25,528 --> 0:5:28,51
MALE SPEAKER: Pretty nice.


140
0:5:28,51 --> 0:5:29,76
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Hey, Rick.


141
0:5:29,76 --> 0:5:35,99



142
0:5:35,99 --> 0:5:37,99
PAT QUIRK: People come here to
visit this place, they don't


143
0:5:37,99 --> 0:5:38,66
even skate.


144
0:5:38,66 --> 0:5:40,94
They go, alright, man, we just
heard about it, and they take


145
0:5:40,94 --> 0:5:42,67
pictures of it like
it's an icon.


146
0:5:42,67 --> 0:5:47,6
Well it's been in Tony Hawk's
video, or whatever, and the


147
0:5:47,6 --> 0:5:48,22
Free Willy.


148
0:5:48,22 --> 0:5:50,2
Burnside's been in
a lot of weird--


149
0:5:50,2 --> 0:5:54,182
and I think it attracts
some weird people.


150
0:5:54,182 --> 0:5:58,4
It's like a shrine to
them, or something.


151
0:5:58,4 --> 0:5:58,79
It's kind of funny.


152
0:5:58,79 --> 0:6:1,84
We should sell little
souvenirs.


153
0:6:1,84 --> 0:6:6,3
"I visited Burnside." "I
survived Burnside."


154
0:6:6,3 --> 0:6:6,66
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Alright.


155
0:6:6,66 --> 0:6:7,18
Thanks, dude.


156
0:6:7,18 --> 0:6:8,6
PAT QUIRK: Alright, man.


157
0:6:8,6 --> 0:6:9,59
That's pretty cool, dude.


158
0:6:9,59 --> 0:6:11,32
Yeah, I like talking
about Burnside.


159
0:6:11,32 --> 0:6:12,85
It's better than talking
about yourself.


160
0:6:12,85 --> 0:8:12,85
