16
0:1:13,46 --> 0:1:19,6
This past week the preliminary analysis of
the Gorilla DNA sequence was published


17
0:1:19,6 --> 0:1:23,98
in Nature magazine, with loads of
headlines making bold assertions about


18
0:1:23,98 --> 0:1:29,11
how identical Gorillas, Chimps and
humans are.  Well of course we're similar,


19
0:1:29,11 --> 0:1:34,7
but so what? Even if we were genetically
identical, I have yet to see apes building


20
0:1:34,7 --> 0:1:38,6
spaceships and flying to the moon, or
producing works of art or music, or


21
0:1:38,6 --> 0:1:43,7
performing stand up comedy.  Obviously
the differences run far beyond the


22
0:1:43,7 --> 0:1:49,33
genetic.  But - when one actually examines
the genetic data itself, you quickly find


23
0:1:49,33 --> 0:1:54,29
out that humans and apes aren't quite as
similar as they're made out to be, and the


24
0:1:54,29 --> 0:2:0,33
"similarities" actually contradict
evolutionary theory.  Chimpanzees are


25
0:2:0,33 --> 0:2:5,57
supposed to be our closest relative, and
therefore most identical to us genetically.  


26
0:2:5,57 --> 0:2:10,54
A 2005 Nature article pinpointed the
genetic differences between humans and


27
0:2:10,54 --> 0:2:15,66
chimpanzees at about 4% different. Yet
this most recent study said the chimp was


28
0:2:15,66 --> 0:2:21,85
only 1.37% different, and Gorilla was only
1.75 percent different than humans, and


29
0:2:21,85 --> 0:2:25,85
the orangutan is 3.4% different than
humans.


30
0:2:25,85 --> 0:2:29,37
Now hold on a minute here, these are
numbers that were published in a peer


31
0:2:29,37 --> 0:2:36,95
reviewed journal!  So is the chimp 4%
different or 1.37% different?  But wait - it


32
0:2:36,95 --> 0:2:41,25
gets weirder - according the Ensemble
website where you can download, analyze


33
0:2:41,25 --> 0:2:44,52
and compare all of these genomes
yourself, we find that the chimpanzee


34
0:2:44,52 --> 0:2:52,15
genome is 3.35 BILLion letters long while
the human genome is a mere 3.1 billion


35
0:2:52,15 --> 0:3:0,71
letters long - wait - that's an 8% difference
in the number of letters alone. So to turn


36
0:3:0,71 --> 0:3:5,19
around and say that chimps and humans,
which are at least 8% different, are in fact


37
0:3:5,19 --> 0:3:13,57
only 1.37% different shows that either a)
they're not telling you everything or b)


38
0:3:13,57 --> 0:3:17,64
these scientists flunked high school
math!


39
0:3:17,64 --> 0:3:22,29
Now I happen to know it's because of
what they are NOT telling you. Well if they


40
0:3:22,29 --> 0:3:27,61
want to play THAT game, hey I can play
that game too!  Let's use THEIR numbers


41
0:3:27,61 --> 0:3:33,11
(which aren't actually numbers at all, but
rather propaganda portrayed as data)


42
0:3:33,11 --> 0:3:38,18
You'll note that if we take into account the
differences in base pair numbers, or


43
0:3:38,18 --> 0:3:42,62
number of letters in the DNA, in the
genomes of the different critters, and


44
0:3:42,62 --> 0:3:45,74
then we add that percentage difference
together with the acknowledged


45
0:3:45,74 --> 0:3:50,38
differences from the latest Nature article,
you quickly see that we are more


46
0:3:50,38 --> 0:3:56,16
genetically similar to Gorillas and
Organgutans than we are to chimps! 


47
0:3:56,16 --> 0:4:2,46
Now these numbers are complete fiction -
they do not portray reality whatsoever,


48
0:4:2,46 --> 0:4:7,5
but neither do the figures presented in
the Nature article.  My numbers are JUST


49
0:4:7,5 --> 0:4:12,6
as valid as the alleged values of similarity
given in the nature article.  Why? Because


50
0:4:12,6 --> 0:4:18,82
of they are not telling you. You see, when
they make these comparisons, the


51
0:4:18,82 --> 0:4:24,9
scientists are ignoring HUGE portions of
the DNA, and homing in on selected


52
0:4:24,9 --> 0:4:31,46
genes that both the apes and humans
have, and comparing just those genes!


53
0:4:31,46 --> 0:4:36,14
Ignoring the fact that these similar genes
are often in radically different locations in


54
0:4:36,14 --> 0:4:39,81
the different organisms, we would of
course expect they genes to be similar -


55
0:4:39,81 --> 0:4:44,3
they had a common designer!  You'll
notice that once a car manufacturer


56
0:4:44,3 --> 0:4:49,1
builds a transmission, they'll use that
transmission in different vehicles - that's


57
0:4:49,1 --> 0:4:52,39
good engineering, that's smart
engineering.  The bracket mounts and


58
0:4:52,39 --> 0:4:56,41
such may be different in different
vehicles, but the transmissions are


59
0:4:56,41 --> 0:5:1,54
essentially the same. That's evidence of a
common designer, not evolution.


60
0:5:1,54 --> 0:5:8,95
So just what are the scientists IGNORING
to arrive at this 98.63% identical claim for


61
0:5:8,95 --> 0:5:14,6
chimpanzees? Well they're ignoring
ORFAN genes - genes which are exclusive


62
0:5:14,6 --> 0:5:18,57
to that organism, and not found in any
others. In other words, if we were to


63
0:5:18,57 --> 0:5:22,66
compare the HUNDREDS of orfan genes
between the apes and humans, we would


64
0:5:22,66 --> 0:5:27,76
find a ZERO percent match between
chimps and humans!  


65
0:5:27,76 --> 0:5:32,8
But wait - It gets better!  With last year's
publication of the Orangutan genome in


66
0:5:32,8 --> 0:5:36,2
Nature magazine, the researchers noted
that, depending on which genes you


67
0:5:36,2 --> 0:5:40,53
compared, the Orangutan was more
closely related to humans than


68
0:5:40,53 --> 0:5:43,2
Chimpanzees were!


69
0:5:43,2 --> 0:5:47,14
This week's report on the Gorilla genome
showed that the Gorillas were as much as


70
0:5:47,14 --> 0:5:52,15
30% dissimilar to humans, and in fact if
we went on the falacious assumptions the


71
0:5:52,15 --> 0:5:56,37
researchers are using, the gorilla was
more identical to humans and


72
0:5:56,37 --> 0:6:1,11
chimpanzees, than the humans and
chimpanzees were to each other.  In other


73
0:6:1,11 --> 0:6:5,8
words, one could interpret the genetic
data to mean that the gorilla was the


74
0:6:5,8 --> 0:6:9,72
intermediate organism between
chimpanzees and humans!


75
0:6:9,72 --> 0:6:13,51
At the end of the day, none of this genetic
information supports the idea of descent


76
0:6:13,51 --> 0:6:18,78
from a common ancestor - because there
is nothing common about the information,


77
0:6:18,78 --> 0:6:24,83
and in fact can be interpreted in a miriad
of evolutionary scenarios, the majority of


78
0:6:24,83 --> 0:6:30,74
which disagree with the alleged fossil
evidence for human evolution!  However, it


79
0:6:30,74 --> 0:6:35,0
all fits in quite nicely with the fact that
each organism was specially and uniquely


80
0:6:35,0 --> 0:6:39,8
created, with the Creator using some
common design among the organisms.


81
0:6:39,8 --> 0:6:44,67
In fact, as Ebersberger et al. explained in
their   2007 "Mapping Human Genetic


82
0:6:44,67 --> 0:7:18,17
Ancestry" paper in Molecular Biology and
Evolution:


83
0:7:18,17 --> 0:7:23,13
Translation: The genetic evidence does
not support common descent, but


84
0:7:23,13 --> 0:7:28,64
resembles a patchwork of genes among
the organisms...... which could best be


85
0:7:28,64 --> 0:7:33,64
explained by a common designer, and I
would suggest that common designer was


86
0:7:33,64 --> 0:7:38,28
the one the Apostle John spoke of in
John 1:3 "All things were made by Him


87
0:7:38,28 --> 0:7:42,38
and without Him was not anything made
that was made."  John was speaking of


88
0:7:42,38 --> 0:7:46,71
Jesus Christ, who created a human form
to live in and sacrifice for your sins and


89
0:7:46,71 --> 0:7:51,71
mine, and rising from the dead so you
could have confidence that He really was


90
0:7:51,71 --> 0:7:55,36
the way to eternal life.


91
0:7:55,36 --> 0:7:59,78
You'll notice a consistent reporting in
these weekly shows - it seems every week


92
0:7:59,78 --> 0:8:3,25
another fossil is unearthed which shows
exactly what we would expect to see,


93
0:8:3,25 --> 0:8:8,57
were the book of Genesis true: Stasis in
the fossil record.  This week, we have a


94
0:8:8,57 --> 0:8:13,65
report in Public Library of Science one on
a wonderful find of fossil sea cows -


95
0:8:13,65 --> 0:8:19,39
manatees.  Fossils taken from Florida,
India and Mexico all reveal that from 28


96
0:8:19,39 --> 0:8:22,84
million years ago through to 3 million
years ago, we see the evolutionary


97
0:8:22,84 --> 0:8:30,49
sequence of manatees evolving over
millions of years....into manatees.  


98
0:8:30,49 --> 0:8:34,9
Brian Thomas from Institute for Creation
Research also pointed out a recent


99
0:8:34,9 --> 0:8:39,39
Chinese Science Bulletin describing fossil
salamanders so well preserved that even


100
0:8:39,39 --> 0:8:41,79
their stomach contents were visible.


101
0:8:41,79 --> 0:8:45,92
Allegedly 150 million years old, the
Chinese researchers remarked how these


102
0:8:45,92 --> 0:8:52,1
fossil salamanders look just like the giant
Chinese salamander.  So 150 million years


103
0:8:52,1 --> 0:8:57,0
has caused the salamander to evolve
into...the salamander.


104
0:8:57,0 --> 0:9:1,53
This is what we typically see in the fossil
record - very little change, stasis.  In stark


105
0:9:1,53 --> 0:9:6,17
contrast to what would expect to find if
evolution were true, and matching exactly


106
0:9:6,17 --> 0:9:9,82
what is described ten times in the first
chapter of Genesis where God created


107
0:9:9,82 --> 0:9:15,35
everything to reproduce faithfully after its
kind. This is powerful evidence for


108
0:9:15,35 --> 0:9:19,77
creation, and to say it's common in the
fossil record is an understatement.


109
0:9:19,77 --> 0:9:25,21
[scary, dramatic music]


110
0:9:25,21 --> 0:9:27,97
Wahoo! Mail for me?


111
0:9:27,97 --> 0:9:32,27
[Scary, dramatic music]


112
0:9:32,27 --> 0:9:36,22
Wow - not only was there a lot of
discussion on last week's show, there


113
0:9:36,22 --> 0:9:40,43
was a lot of good comments and
questions brought - and I'm afraid, I won't


114
0:9:40,43 --> 0:9:44,71
be able to recite them all.
GodHasNoMother did a fine job trying to


115
0:9:44,71 --> 0:10:37,21
explain prophecy and the gospel to those
who would not hear.  I salute you!  


116
0:10:37,21 --> 0:10:41,47
Good point - let us also remember the
jawless fish fossils found in China in


117
0:10:41,47 --> 0:10:47,48
1999, allegedly dated 530 million years
old, which is some 25 million years older


118
0:10:47,48 --> 0:10:51,26
than the Burgess shales, so that's
another example of vertebrate fossils


119
0:10:51,26 --> 0:11:13,53
before our alleged ancient ancestor.


120
0:11:13,53 --> 0:11:20,75
That's why *I* am broadcasting from a
different, top secret hideout every week.


121
0:11:20,75 --> 0:11:49,99
1whitemoon wrote in with an interesting
question which stirred a lot of response:


122
0:11:49,99 --> 0:11:53,55
True, and while I don't really have a
problem with people classifying


123
0:11:53,55 --> 0:11:58,12
organisms in this way, the classification
in no way demonstrates evolution. For


124
0:11:58,12 --> 0:12:2,0
example - where on earth would you put
the duckbilled platypus?  In fact this


125
0:12:2,0 --> 0:12:6,95
classification system was actually
invented by a creationist, Linaeus, who


126
0:12:6,95 --> 0:12:10,59
referred to the organism groups as
"species" because he believed they were


127
0:12:10,59 --> 0:12:15,94
SPECIAlly created.  I get a lot of people
complaining about the term "kinds"


128
0:12:15,94 --> 0:12:19,94
asking for a definition of "kind," which is
fair enough - but the problem is that for


129
0:12:19,94 --> 0:12:25,97
both definitions of species and kinds, you
will have exceptions to the definition.  The


130
0:12:25,97 --> 0:12:30,92
bottom line here I wish to make though, is
that classifying organisms does not affirm


131
0:12:30,92 --> 0:12:33,3
evolutionary ascent.


132
0:12:33,3 --> 0:13:7,53
MrAlienAssassin responded to
1whitemoon with:


133
0:13:7,53 --> 0:13:14,25
This canard was actually answered
decades ago.  The alleged "leg bones" are


134
0:13:14,25 --> 0:13:18,45
different between the males and females,
because these bones serve a purpose in


135
0:13:18,45 --> 0:13:22,42
the reproductive systems of the
cetaceans.  They are muscle anchors and


136
0:13:22,42 --> 0:13:28,51
claspers.  There are no vestigial hind limbs
on cetaceans, they serve a very real


137
0:13:28,51 --> 0:13:50,32
purpose.


138
0:13:50,32 --> 0:13:54,62
Mazle (however you say that), seeing as
how you cannot create a giraffe from


139
0:13:54,62 --> 0:13:59,93
scratch, then you are in absolutely no
position to be criticizing the design of


140
0:13:59,93 --> 0:14:6,39
said giraffe.  You need to watch my CrEvo
rant #67, poor design. It is horribly


141
0:14:6,39 --> 0:14:11,12
ignorant and arrogant to make such
criticisms. The laryngial nerve argument


142
0:14:11,12 --> 0:14:41,62
was answered a long time ago by Dr.
Jerry Bergman here:


143
0:14:41,62 --> 0:14:45,39
Okay - I have no idea what you're talking
about - it's true that chickens have


144
0:14:45,39 --> 0:14:48,93
recessive genes for teeth- in fact, going
by the fossil record, many birds had teeth


145
0:14:48,93 --> 0:14:55,43
that have been lost over time. That's
reverse evolution.  As for "human teeth?"  I


146
0:14:55,43 --> 0:14:59,42
don't know who told you that, but I'd be
asking for a reference.  Same with the tail -


147
0:14:59,42 --> 0:15:2,16
I don't know what to tell you because this
person did not provide you with a


148
0:15:2,16 --> 0:15:32,77
reference.  So I'd call them on that and ask
for a reference first.


149
0:15:32,77 --> 0:15:36,65
Thanks for writing in, and indeed, I
recognize that if the science can meet an


150
0:15:36,65 --> 0:15:40,32
unbiased test, it will get published. As I
previously mentioned, many creationists


151
0:15:40,32 --> 0:15:44,34
have published in peer reviewed journals.
I've also been a part of the process, both


152
0:15:44,34 --> 0:15:49,32
as the one getting reviewed, and a
reviewer. However, in this particular case,


153
0:15:49,32 --> 0:15:54,25
with Springer-Verlag, the executive vice
president of corporate communications at


154
0:15:54,25 --> 0:15:59,5
Springer gave the reasons why the book
was run through additional peer review:


155
0:15:59,5 --> 0:16:4,3
Springer was unaware of the role of the
book editors had in the intelligent design


156
0:16:4,3 --> 0:16:8,27
movement, and said Springer does not
"endorse intelligent design as a legitimate


157
0:16:8,27 --> 0:16:13,22
area of scientific research."  Notice he
mentioned absolutely nothing of the


158
0:16:13,22 --> 0:16:18,24
content of the book. There was no
problem - the book had already gone


159
0:16:18,24 --> 0:16:22,14
through vetting by two Springer
reviewers.  It was only after Sanford's


160
0:16:22,14 --> 0:16:27,23
personal beliefs were brought up that the
book was yanked.  This is open, flagrant


161
0:16:27,23 --> 0:16:29,26
bigotry.


162
0:16:29,26 --> 0:17:23,28
Several people asked why I didn't present
proof OF creation.  


163
0:17:23,28 --> 0:17:29,62
Ah, but do not mistake confidence for
smugness. I am confident, not smug.


164
0:17:29,62 --> 0:17:33,15
There are numerous things wrong with
your premise: First of all, as I'm sure


165
0:17:33,15 --> 0:17:38,59
you're already aware, science cannot
"prove" something, it can only "disprove"


166
0:17:38,59 --> 0:17:43,43
something.  So all too often evidence FOR
creation is also evidence AGAINST


167
0:17:43,43 --> 0:17:47,91
evolution - the two happen at the same
time.  Secondly, if you'd paid close


168
0:17:47,91 --> 0:17:53,6
attention, you'll notice that I HAVE
provided evidence FOR creation.  One bit


169
0:17:53,6 --> 0:17:57,84
of evidence I've beat to death is stasis in
the fossil record. Evolution requires


170
0:17:57,84 --> 0:18:1,12
change over time - a gaining of novel
features and functions in an organism


171
0:18:1,12 --> 0:18:5,13
over time, and a fossil order.  I've showed
over and over again with literally dozens


172
0:18:5,13 --> 0:18:8,96
of examples, including the tetrapod
footprints, how the alleged fossil


173
0:18:8,96 --> 0:18:13,77
sequence is in the wrong order, and the
organisms we find in the fossil record


174
0:18:13,77 --> 0:18:18,58
show extinction and stasis - neither of
which help evolution, and both of which


175
0:18:18,58 --> 0:18:23,25
fit perfectly within the creation model.  Ten
times in the first chapter of Genesis alone


176
0:18:23,25 --> 0:18:28,99
it says God created life to reproduce after
its KIND, therefore good evidence for


177
0:18:28,99 --> 0:18:33,76
creation would be lifeforms showing little
to no change between the fossil record


178
0:18:33,76 --> 0:18:38,62
and modern times, which is exactly what
we see.  We also see profound evidence


179
0:18:38,62 --> 0:18:43,8
for a worldwide flood, which does two
things: It refutes the idea of deep time,


180
0:18:43,8 --> 0:18:46,63
because deep time is only used to explain
away the evidence left behind by Noah's


181
0:18:46,63 --> 0:18:50,81
flood, and it simultaneously affirms the
Genesis account which talks about a


182
0:18:50,81 --> 0:18:52,42
world wide flood.


183
0:18:52,42 --> 0:18:56,8
And by the way - the footprints in the
Tapeats sandstone are a dead-ringer


184
0:18:56,8 --> 0:19:14,36
match to the footprints in the Coconino
sandstone. Compare them for yourself.
