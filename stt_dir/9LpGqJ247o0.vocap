###4 >> WILLIAMS: Tonight's gathering of the candidates, this Special Edition of Rock Center comes
###8 after what is already been a long campaign. It started in Iowa, continued in New Hampshire,
###16 but after a bruising battle in South Carolina, the fights come now here to Florida. The first
###23 big state to have a big say in the GOP contest. The issues? A stubborn ten percent unemployment
###31 rate, for seniors, real concerns about the future of Medicare and Social Security, high
###37 foreclosure rates, education, immigration, and ninety miles of the Florida coast, Cuba.
###43 That and more.
###43 >> ANNOUNCER: Times, from the University of South Florida in Tampa Bay, here now Brian
###45 Williams.
###45 >> WILLIAMS: Good evening to you. Welcome to the University of South Florida. The audience
###60 is in place. The candidates are here. Lord knows, everyone knows each other by now. And
###68 so we get under way tonight as again this Republican primary battle finds itself at
###75 a critical stage. And the Voters here in Florida and across the country are dialed in and paying
###81 attention. We want to get right too it so a quick explanation of our rules. Again, you
###85 are familiar by now, sixty seconds for answers, thirty seconds for rebuttals or follow-ups
###92 at the moderators discretion. We've asked our invited guests here this evening to withhold
###96 their applause any verbal reactions to what they hear on stage so as to ensure this is
###102 about the four candidates here tonight and what they have to say. As for topics, it's
###108 a wide-open evening, so let's begin. First of all, since we last gathered, three of you
###114 on stage have enjoyed victories, an unprecedented moment in the modern era, three separate candidates,
###122 three separate victories. Congratulations to you. In all three contests, the voters
###127 made it clear to pollsters and elsewhere that electability was a crucial element to them,
###134 a crucial argument this year. And so, speaker Gingrich, on electability to begin with, your
###142 rival, your opponent on this stage, Governor Romney, was out today calling you erratic,
###148 a failed leader, and warning that your nomination for this party could perhaps result in what
###154 he called an "October surprise a day." So given the fact that he went after you today
###160 on this topic of electability, your response tonight, Mr. Speaker?
###164 >> GINGRICH: Well, in 1980, when Ronald Reagan started the year about 30 points behind Jimmy
###169 Carter and when the Republican establishment described his economic ideas as "voodoo economics,"
###177 Reagan just cheerfully went out and won the debate, won the nomination, and won the general
###182 election carrying more states than Herbert Hoover carried -- than Roosevelt carried against
###186 Herbert Hoover. I would suggest that a solid conservative who believes in economic growth
###192 through lower taxes and less regulation, who believes in an American energy program, who
###196 believes in a strong national defense, and who has the courage to stand up to the Washington
###201 establishment, may make the Washington establishment uncomfortable, but is also exactly the kind
###206 of bold, tough leader the American people want, they're not sending somebody to Washington
###211 to manage the decay. They're sending somebody to Washington to change it, and that requires
###216 somebody who's prepared to be controversial when necessary.
###218 >> WILLIAMS: And about your problems, your departure from the speakership in the '90s,
###225 what's the case you make to the American people and voters in Republican primary contests
###230 about how you've changed, Mr. Speaker?
###232 >> GINGRICH: Well, first of all, the case I make is that, when I was speaker, we had
###235 four consecutive balanced budgets, the only time in your lifetime, Brian, that we've had
###239 four consecutive balanced budgets. Most people think that's good. We were down to 4.2 percent
###244 unemployment; 11 million new jobs were created. Most people think that's good. We reformed
###248 welfare. And two out of three people went to work or went to school. People think that's
###252 good. I left the speakership after the 1998 election because I took responsibility for
###257 the fact that our results weren't as good as they should be. I think that's what a leader
###260 should do. I took responsibility, and I didn't want to stay around, as Nancy Pelosi has.
###265 I wanted to get out and do other things. I founded four small businesses. And I'm very
###270 comfortable that my four years as speaker, working with a Democratic president, achieved
###274 the kind of conservative values that most Republicans want to have in a president.
###278 >> WILLIAMS: Governor Romney, for his part, the speaker said about you that were dancing
###282 on eggs during this campaign, a good salesman with a weak product. And even Chris Christie,
###289 one of the most popular politicians in this country, speaking on your behalf, said this
###294 weekend your challenge is "going to be how to connect with people." Same question to
###300 you about electability.
###301 >> ROMNEY: Well, I think this is going to come down to a question of leadership. I think
###305 as you choose the president of the United States, you're looking for a person who can
###308 lead this country in a very critical time, lead the free world, and the free world has
###312 to lead the entire world. I think it's about leadership, and the Speaker was given an opportunity
###317 to be the leader of our party in 1994. And at the end of four years, he had to resign
###321 in disgrace. Now, in the 1970s, he came to Washington. I went to work in my first job
###326 in the 1970s at the bottom level of a consulting firm. In the 1990s, he had to resign in disgrace
###332 from this job as Speaker.I had the opportunity to go off and run the Olympic winter games.
###337 In the 15 years after he left the speakership, the Speaker has been working as an influence
###342 peddler in Washington. And during those 15 years, I helped turn around the Olympics,
###348 helped begin a very successful turnaround in the state of Massachusetts. The Speaker
###353 -- when I was fighting against cap and trade, the Speaker was sitting down with Nancy Pelosi
###357 on a sofa encouraging it. When I was fighting to say that the Paul Ryan plan to solve Medicare
###362 was bold and right, he was saying that it was right wing social engineering. So we have
###367 very different perspectives on leadership, and the kind of leadership that our conservative
###372 movement needs not just to get elected, but to get the country right.
###376 >> WILLIAMS: Mr. Speaker?
###377 >> GINGRICH: Well, look, I'm not going to spend the evening trying to chase Governor
###380 Romney's misinformation. We'll have a site at Newt.org by tomorrow morning. We'll list
###386 everything -- he just said at least four things that are false. I don't want to waste the
###388 time on them. I think the American public deserve a discussion about how to beat Barack
###392 Obama, the American public deserves a discussion of what we would do about the economy. And
###397 I just think this is the worst kind of trivial politics. I mean, he said at least four things
###402 that were false. We have an ad in which both John McCain and Mike Huckabee in 2007 and
###407 2008 explain how much they think Governor Romney can't tell the truth. I just suggest
###411 people look at them. Don't listen to me, don't believe me. Just look at the ad with Mike
###415 Huckabee and Senator McCain and you will understand exactly what you just saw.
###419 >> WILLIAMS: Governor Romney, to your electability, let's talk about the southern base of the
###424 GOP. Among those who describe themselves as very conservative, only one in five have gone
###430 your way. How is that going to bode well for the longer campaign?
###433 >> ROMNEY: Had a great record, as you know, in New Hampshire. The New Hampshire voters
###437 overwhelmingly supported me. Actually, among Republicans in New Hampshire, I got the biggest
###441 support that we have seen among Republicans, even including Ronald Reagan, that far back.
###445 So I'm pleased I will be able to connect well with our Republican base. But let's go back
###449 to what the Speaker mentioned with regards to leadership, and that is -- I mean, we don't
###453 have to take my word for the facts. They're accurate. I will point out that they are accurate.
###458 But the truth is that the members of his own team, his congressional team, after his four
###463 years of leadership, they moved to replace him. They also took a vote, and 88 percent
###470 of Republicans voted to reprimand the Speaker, and he did resign in disgrace after that.This
###475 was the first time in American history that a Speaker of the House has resigned from the
###480 House. And so that was the judgment rendered by his own people as to his leadership. Look,
###486 don't forget at the end of the Speaker's term as Speaker, his approval rating was down to
###490 18 percent. We suffered historic losses after his four years in office. And I'll make this
###496 other point, which is we just learned today that his contract with Freddie Mac was provided
###502 by the lobbyists at Freddie Mac. I don't think we can possibly retake the White House if
###508 the person who's leading our party is the person who was working for the chief lobbyist
###512 of Freddie Mac. Freddie Mac was paying Speaker Gingrich $1,600,000 at the same time Freddie
###519 Mac was costing the people of Florida millions upon millions of dollars.
###523 >> WILLIAMS: Do you realize last week, Governor, you said that -- you complained that too much
###527 of your time on stage lately has been spent on negativity vis-a-vis the other candidates?
###533 You pledged to spend your time going after the incumbent president, yet here we are again.
###538 >> ROMNEY: I'll tell you why, which is I learned something from that last contest in South
###542 Carolina, and that was I had incoming from all directions, was overwhelmed with a lot
###547 of attacks. And I'm not going to sit back and get attacked day in and day out without
###551 returning fire. I would like not to have the kind of attacks that came against me. There
###555 were two ads run by Speaker Gingrich. Outside fact- checking groups said these ads were
###559 false, and yet they continue to run them, and one by his campaign, and one by a PAC,
###564 in his benefit. And I know he can't control that, but those ads were pretty heavy on me.
###568 So I'm going to point out things I think people need to know. It was Republicans who replaced
###573 him in the House, voted to reprimand him. And it was the head lobbyist of Freddie Mac
###579 with whom he had a contract at a time when Floridians were suffering as a result in part
###584 of Freddie Mac.
###585 >> WILLIAMS: Mr. Speaker, 30 seconds before I move on.
###588 >> GINGRICH: Now, wait a second. I mean, he just went on and on and on, making a whole
###593 series of allegations. First of all, he may have been a good financier; he's a terrible
###597 historian. The fact is, the vote on the Ethics Committee was in January of 1997. I asked
###605 the Republicans to vote yes because we had to get it behind us. The Democrats had filed
###610 84 ethics charges for a simple reason: We had taken control of the House after 40 years,
###616 and they were very bitter. And the fact is, on every single ethics charge of substance
###621 that was dismissed in the end, the only thing we did wrong is we had one lawyer written
###625 by letters -- I mean, written one letter, and the one letter was in error. I didn't
###629 pay a fine. I paid the cost of going through the process of determining it was wrong. I
###634 left two years later, and, frankly, we were right to get it behind us because the tax
###638 cut that led to economic growth, the four balanced budgets all came after that vote.
###643 So you have all this stuff just jumbled up. Apparently your consultants aren't very good
###647 historians. What you ought to do is stop and look at the facts. And the fact is, we won
###651 the House for the third time in 1998, but the margin wasn't big enough. So I am the
###656 only speaker up to that point since the 1920s who had led the Republican Party to three
###661 consecutive victories. By the way, in 2006 when you chaired the Governors Association,
###666 we lost governorships. And in the four years that you were governor, we lost seats in the
###670 Massachusetts legislature. So I think as a party builder, the 20 years I spent building
###674 the House Republican Party stands pretty good as an example of leadership.
###677 >> WILLIAMS: Senator Santorum, you have labeled this choice as being between an erratic and
###683 a moderate. You come in here tonight with one victory in Iowa. Where is your path to
###690 the top here?
###691 >> SANTORUM: Well, I think if you've learned anything about this election, that any type
###696 of prediction is going to be wrong. The idea that this was a two-person race has been an
###701 idea that has been in fashion now for eight months, and it's been wrong about eight times.
###707 And so we're looking at this race trying to paint a positive vision for our country. You
###712 ask my path to victory. My path to victory is to tell the people of Florida and tell
###717 the people of this country of someone who's here that presents a very clear contrast with
###721 the president of the United States, someone that will make him the issue in this race,
###726 not the Republican candidate, someone who has a track record of being a strong conservative,
###731 someone who has a vision, a bold vision to reach out to the voters that I reached out
###735 and was successful in getting when I ran for the Senate in Pennsylvania twice, a state
###739 we haven't won for the presidency since 1988. I won it twice, once in a year where George
###745 Bush lost the state by five and I won it by six. How did I do it? I had plans out there
###750 that included everybody, plans like I have today, talking about manufacturing, talking
###754 about things that -- that are touchstones with the Reagan Democrats that provided that
###759 49-state win. We talked about faith. We talked about family. We talked about jobs. We talked
###764 about limited government. And that message was one that connected in a state -- well,
###770 just like Florida, that's one of those key states that we're going to win. And that sets
###773 me apart, really, from anybody else on this stage as someone who's been victorious with
###778 a strong, principled conservative message.
###780 >> WILLIAMS: And yet, Senator, you are former Senator Santorum, having lost your home state
###784 by 18 points.
###785 >> SANTORUM: Yeah, well, if I was the only guy that lost an election that year in Pennsylvania,
###789 that would be maybe a big statement, but our gubernatorial candidate lost by more than
###792 I did. We lost five congressional seats. And it was an historic loss in our statehouse.
###797 It was a meltdown year. We lost 23 out of 33 senators. And probably unlike a lot of
###801 other candidates, when you're running in an election year that you know you're running
###804 against a headwind, a lot of folks crouch down, they get out of the way of the wind
###810 and try to sneak in. I stood tall, stood for what I believed in, talked about issues like
###816 the threat of Iran on the horizon, talked about the need to reform Social Security and
###820 Medicare, talked about the issues that, well, now we're all talking about today, as I did
###825 at a time when nobody wanted to hear that message. I also was running with a president
###829 who was sitting at about 35 percent favorable, and I was standing by him and trying to reform
###833 Social Security, and trying to fight the war and win the war in Iraq, and I stand by that.
###837 And one of the things I figured out when I was running in that tough election year, there's
###842 one thing worse than losing an election, and that's not standing for the principles that
###846 you hold.
###847 >> WILLIAMS: Congressman Paul, there is no denying you have an enthusiastic base support
###852 -- base of support. We could hear them outside tonight. Yet there was that recent interview,
###857 you were asked if while campaigning you envision yourself in the Oval Office, and you said,
###864 "Not really, but I think it's a possibility." So that begs the question about your path
###869 and when you will give an honest answer about perhaps your third-party plans going forward.
###876 Are you in this regardless of the outcome to your right here on this stage?
###880 >> PAUL: Well, unlike others, maybe they sit around and daydream about being in the White
###883 House. I just don't sit around daydreaming about it, but I'm in a race, I'm in a good
###887 race. You talk about electability. Why don't we take on the first three states and take
###892 everybody 30 years and under? I'm doing pretty darned well. I'm winning that vote. But what
###896 about if you compare my name to Obama? I do quite well, if not better, than the rest.
###902 So, to say that there has only been three races, and talk about not being electable,
###908 I think is a bit of a stretch. As a matter of fact, the delegates haven't even been appointed
###913 in Iowa yet. I mean, quite frankly, we have a pretty good chance of getting a good sum
###918 of those because of the organization. We only had a straw vote. I mean, this argument on
###922 who won, it was a straw vote. I mean, the delegates is what counts. But I do want to
###928 address the earlier discussion that you had about 1997. I had been out of Congress for
###934 12 years, and I went back in '96 and arrived there in '97. It was chaotic, let me tell
###940 you. It was a mess, and it was a mess for 12 years. And Newt had a big job on his hands,
###945 but he really had to attack the conservatives. He did it boldly. And quite frankly, I think
###951 the reason -- he didn't not run for Speaker, you know, two years later. He didn't have
###958 the votes. That was what the problem was. So this idea that he voluntarily reneged and
###962 he was going to punish himself because we didn't do well in the election, that's just
###965 not the way it was.
###966 >> WILLIAMS: Let me come at it this way. If Newt Gingrich emerges from the GOP primary
###971 process as the nominee of the party, do you go your own way?
###975 >> PAUL: Well, I have done a lot of that in my lifetime.
###979 >> WILLIAMS: I should be more specific. Will you run as a third- party candidate?
###983 >> PAUL: I have no plans to do that, no intention. And when I have been pressed on it, and they
###988 asked me why, and I said, I don't want to. But I haven't been an absolutist. When I left
###994 Congress, I didn't have plans on going back, but I did after 12 years. I went back to medicine.
###999 So, no, I don't have any plans to do that. No.
###1003 >> WILLIAMS: Would you support a Newt Gingrich as nominee of the GOP?
###1006 >> PAUL: Well, he keeps hinting about attacking the Fed, and he talks about gold. Now if I
###1012 could just change him on foreign policy, we might be able to talk business.
###1016 >> [LAUGHTER]
###1016 >> WILLIAMS: Speaker Gingrich, are you willing to adjust to pick up an endorsement from Texas?
###1021 >> GINGRICH: Well, I got one on Friday from Governor Perry, which I liked a lot as a starting
###1027 point. So I like endorsements from Texas. And Congressman Paul is right. There's an
###1032 area -- I think what he has said about the Federal Reserve and what he has said about
###1035 the importance of monetary policy, the proposal I've issued for a gold commission, which hearkens
###1040 back to something that he and Jesse Helms helped develop, on which he served on in 1981,
###1045 and the fact that we have people of the caliber of Lew Lehrman and Jim Grant, who have agreed
###1049 they would chair such a commission, I think they're areas we can work on. There are places
###1052 we disagree very deeply. Iran is a good example. But there are places -- you know, you build
###1056 a coalition by trying to find ways you can work together, and frankly we could work together
###1061 a lot more than either one of us could work with Barack Obama.
###1064 >> WILLIAMS: Governor Romney, a question you know is coming because of what you have set
###1068 in motion for tomorrow when you release one year's tax returns and your estimates for
###1075 2011. We know it's not a matter of producing them. You said during the McCain vetting process
###1082 you turned over 23 years which you had at the ready because, to quote you, you're something
###1088 of a packrat. So, prior to tomorrow, can you tell us tonight what's in there that's going
###1097 to get people talking? What's in there that's going to be controversial? What's in there
###1102 that you may find yourself defending?
###1104 >> ROMNEY: No surprises, Brian. The most extensive disclosure that I made was the financial disclosure
###1111 requirements under the law. We each had to do that, and I laid out what my assets are
###1116 and where they are, and people have been looking at that. It's very similar to what it was
###1120 four years ago. And so my income tax will show that that's where the profits and rewards
###1128 came. The real question is not so much my taxes, but the taxes of the American people.
###1133 The real question people are going to ask is, who's going to help the American people
###1136 at a time when folks are having real tough times? And that's why I put forward a plan
###1141 to eliminate the tax on savings for middle income Americans. Anyone making under $200,000
###1146 a year, I would eliminate the tax on interest, dividends and capital gains. People need help
###1151 to be able to save their money. I'll also bring the corporate tax rate down to 25 percent
###1156 as quickly as possible and then begin a process of reshaping the entire tax code. It's far
###1162 too complex, it's far too intrusive, it's far too great. I would like to lower the rates,
###1168 broaden the base, akin to what we saw in the Bowles-Simpson plan, which, by the way, the
###1172 president commissioned and then simply brushed aside. We need to go back to that, get our
###1176 rates down, and get a pro-growth tax policy in this country.
###1180 >> WILLIAMS: So, across this country tomorrow, when people learn the details of the tax return
###1186 you release -- and, of course, you'll be under pressure to release more years after that
###1190 -- nothing will stick out, nothing will emerge that will be talked about by this time tomorrow
###1197 night?
###1197 >> ROMNEY: Oh, I'm sure people will talk about it. I mean, you'll see my income, how much
###1201 taxes I've paid, how much I've paid to charity. You'll see how complicated taxes can be. But
###1207 -- but I pay all the taxes that are legally required and not a dollar more. I don't think
###1211 you want someone as the candidate for president who pays more taxes than he owes. So I'll
###1216 -- I'll point out that that's the case. And will there will discussion? Sure. Will it
###1220 be an article? Yeah. But is it entirely legal and fair? Absolutely. I'm proud of the fact
###1225 that I pay a lot of taxes. And the fact is, there are a lot of people in this country
###1229 that pay a lot of taxes. I'd like to see our tax rate come down and focus on growing the
###1234 country, getting people back to work. That's our problem in this country right now. We've
###1238 got a lot of people out of work. Let's let them start paying taxes because they got jobs
###1242 again.
###1242 >> WILLIAMS: Speaker Gingrich, what will satisfy you?
###1244 >> GINGRICH: Well, first of all, he said the other day when he indicated he was going to
###1248 release it, that was the right thing to do. It's actually a tradition his father started
###1251 in 1967. I think it's the right thing to do. The biggest thing I think will be -- and I
###1256 think you indicated the other day that you pay something like a 15 percent marginal rate.
###1260 My position is not to attack him for paying a 15 percent marginal rate. I have in my tax
###1265 proposal an alternative flat tax on the Hong Kong model, where you get to choose what you
###1270 want, and our rate's 15 percent. So I'm prepared to describe my 15 percent flat tax as the
###1275 Mitt Romney flat tax. I'd like to bring everybody else down to Mitt's rate, not try to bring
###1279 him up to some other rate.
###1281 >> WILLIAMS: And -- yes, Governor?
###1282 >> [CROSSTALK]
###1282 >> ROMNEY: Mr. Speaker, is the tax on capital gains also 15 percent or is it zero?
###1286 >> GINGRICH: Zero.
###1287 >> ROMNEY: Well, under that -- under that plan, I'd have paid no taxes in the last two
###1290 years.
###1291 >> GINGRICH: Well, if that -- and if you created enough jobs doing that -- it was Alan Greenspan
###1295 who first said the best rate, if you want to create jobs for capital gains, is zero.
###1299 My number-one goal is to create a maximum number of jobs to put the American people
###1304 back to work. It's a straightforward argument.
###1306 >> WILLIAMS: And, Governor, how about your father's model of 12 years' worth of returns?
###1310 >> ROMNEY: You know, I agree with my dad on a lot of things, but we also disagree. And
###1315 -- and going out with 12 years of returns is not something I'm going to do. I'm putting
###1318 out two years, which is more than anyone else on this stage. I think it'll satisfy the interests
###1323 of the American people to see that I pay my taxes, where I give my charitable contributions
###1327 to, and I think that's the right number.
###1329 >> WILLIAMS: More broadly, Governor, just an aside, have you been surprised at the degree
###1332 to which your wealth has become an issue? You spoke rather forcefully in South Carolina
###1338 over the weekend on Saturday night about this, about the degree to which you've had to defend,
###1346 as you put it, your success in business.
###1348 >> ROMNEY: Yeah, I knew that was going to come from the Obama team. I understood that.
###1353 We see that on the left. I was surprised to see people in the Republican Party pick up
###1358 the weapons of the left and start using them to attack free enterprise. I think those weapons
###1363 will be used against us. I think it's very unfortunate. I will not apologize for having
###1367 been successful. I did not inherit what my wife and I have, nor did she. What we have
###1373 -- what -- what I was able to build, I built the old-fashioned way, by earning it, by working
###1378 hard. And I was proud of the fact that we helped create businesses that grew, that employed
###1382 people. And these are not just high-end financial jobs. We helped start Staples, for instance.
###1387 It employs 90,000 people. These are middle- income people. There are entry-level jobs,
###1392 too. I'm proud of the fact that we helped people around the country, Bright Horizons
###1396 children centers, the Sports Authority, Steel Dynamics, a new steel company. These employ
###1401 people, middle-income people. And the nature of America is individuals pursuing their dreams
###1406 don't make everyone else poorer; they help make us all better off. And so I'm not going
###1411 to apologize for success or apologize for free enterprise. I believe free enterprise
###1416 is one of the things that -- that we have to reinvigorate in this country if we want
###1420 to get people working again.
###1421 >> WILLIAMS: Senator Santorum, Governor Romney has said -- and he said again tonight -- he
###1425 expected these attacks from the other side. He's been taking fire as he would from the
###1430 Democrats from the group on this stage. That means you. That includes you.
###1434 >> ROMNEY: I didn't mean to include...
###1436 >> SANTORUM: No, I have -- I have not. I have not fired at Governor Romney on -- on -- on
###1441 his -- his work at Bain Capital. In fact, I've been maybe unique in that regard that
###1445 I haven't. I believe in capitalism. I believe in free markets. I believe Governor Romney
###1450 can go out and -- and earn whatever he can. And hopefully he creates jobs by earning that
###1455 money and investing in companies. My only question with Governor Romney is that, you
###1459 know, to be a great defender of capitalism and talk about the importance of -- of capitalism
###1463 and free markets, and in the case of Bain, constructive capitalism and destructive capitalism.
###1469 My question to Governor Romney and to Speaker Gingrich, if you believe in capitalism that
###1473 much, then why did you support the bailout of Wall Street, where you had an opportunity
###1478 to allow destructive capitalism to work, to allow a failure of a -- of a system that needed
###1484 to fail because people did things that in capitalism pay -- you pay a price? And we
###1491 should have allowed those financial institutions to go through the bankruptcy process, and
###1497 we would have had resulted not what we are seeing here in Florida with this lengthy recession/depression
###1502 of the housing market. You would have seen the effects of what Governor Romney advocated
###1508 for and advocates today at Bain Capital, which is allowing companies that do not do their
###1514 job, cannot be competitive, make mistakes, to fail and pay the price, instead of having
###1519 government come in and prop them up.
###1520 >> WILLIAMS: And Speaker Gingrich, just tonight, two hours ago, in fact, you released your
###1524 '06 contract with Freddie Mac. We alluded to this earlier. Your company was paid $25,000
###1530 a month, $300,000 for the year. But it didn't provide a further explanation of services
###1538 for Freddie Mac. Why one year's worth? Governor Romney today used the expression "work product."
###1545 He wants to see your work product, and the word "lobbying" has been thrown around, and
###1549 you strongly disagree with that.
###1551 >> GINGRICH: Well, first of all, if you read the contract -- and we can go back and check
###1554 the other years. We had to work through the process of getting an approval because it
###1558 was a confidentiality agreement. But if you read the contract which we have posted, and
###1564 the Center for Health Transformation had to get permission to post, it says very clearly
###1568 supposed to do consulting work. The governor did consulting work for years. I have never
###1571 suggested his consulting work was lobbying. So let me start right there. There is no place
###1576 in the contract that provides for lobbying. I have never done any lobbying. Congressman
###1580 J.C. Watts, who for seven years was the head of the Freddie Mac Watch Committee, said flatly
###1584 he has never been approached by me. The fact is that Congressman Rick Lazio, who is chairman
###1590 of the Housing Subcommittee, said he has never been approached by me. And the only report
###1594 in the newspaper was "The New York Times" in July of 2008, which said I told the House
###1600 Republicans they should vote no, not give Freddie Mac any money, because it needed to
###1605 be reformed. So there's no --
###1606 >> [CROSSTALK]
###1606 >> WILLIAMS: So you never peddled influence, as he described tonight?
###1608 >> GINGRICH: What?
###1608 >> WILLIAMS: You never peddled influence, as Governor Romney accused you of tonight?
###1612 >> GINGRICH: You know, there is a point in the process where it gets unnecessarily personal
###1616 and nasty. And that's sad. The fact is I have had a very long career of trying to represent
###1622 the people of Georgia and, as Speaker, the people of the United States. I think it's
###1626 pretty clear to say that I have never, ever gone and done any lobbying. In fact, we brought
###1632 in an expert on lobbying law and trained all of our staff. And that expert is prepared
###1637 to testify that he was brought in to say here is the bright line between what you can do
###1643 as a citizen and what you do as a lobbyist. And we consistently, for 12 years, running
###1647 four small businesses, stayed away from lobbying, precisely because I thought this kind of defamatory
###1654 and factually false charge would be made.
###1656 >> ROMNEY: Well, Mr. Speaker, you were -- on this stage, at a prior debate, you said you
###1662 were paid $300,000 by Freddie Mac for an historian -- as an historian. They don't pay people
###1668 $25,000 a month for six years as historians. That adds up to about $1.6 million. They weren't
###1675 hiring you as an historian. And this contract proves that you were not an historian. You
###1677 were a consultant.
###1678 >> GINGRICH: I was a consultant.
###1680 >> ROMNEY: It doesn't say that you provided historical experience, it said that you were
###1683 as a consultant. And you were hired by the chief lobbyist of Freddie Mac, not the CEO,
###1689 not the head of public affairs. By the chief lobbyist at Freddie Mac. You also spoke publicly
###1695 in favor of these GSEs, these government- sponsored entities, at a very time when Freddie
###1702 Mac was getting America in a position where we would have had a massive housing collapse.
###1706 You could have spoken out aggressively. You could have spoken out in a way to say these
###1709 guys are wrong, this needs to end. But instead, you were being paid by them. You were making
###1714 over $1 million at the same time people in Florida were being hurt by millions of dollars.
###1718 >> GINGRICH: Well, this is a good example. As a businessman, you know that the gross
###1721 revenue of Bain wasn't your personal income. We had a company. The company had three offices.
###1726 The company was being paid. My share annually was about $35,000 a year. And the fact is
###1732 I offered strategic advice, largely based on my knowledge of history, including the
###1736 history of Washington. Government-sponsored enterprises include, for example, telephone
###1740 cooperatives, rural electric cooperatives, federal credit unions. There are many different
###1745 kinds of government-sponsored enterprises, and many of them have done very good things.
###1748 And in the early years, before some people, particularly Jim Johnson and other Democrats,
###1754 began to change the model you could make a pretty good argument that in the early years,
###1757 those housing institutions were responsible for a lot of people getting a lot of good
###1761 housing.
###1761 >> ROMNEY: There's no question about that, but we're talking about one. We're talking
###1765 about Freddie Mac.
###1765 >> GINGRICH: Right.
###1766 >> ROMNEY: And that one did a lot of bad for a lot of people. And you were working there
###1769 making over $1 million for your entities --
###1772 >> [CROSSTALK]
###1772 >> GINGRICH: For the entities. As long as we agree, for the entities.
###1774 >> ROMNEY: Owned by you. I don't know whether 100 percent owned by you, but I presume. Owned
###1778 by you, over $1.6 million. And you said it was $300,000. It was $1.6 million. That's
###1782 a difference.
###1783 >> GINGRICH: So, Mitt, what -- Mitt, what's the gross revenue of Bain in the years you
###1786 were associated with it? What's the gross revenue?
###1788 >> ROMNEY: Very -- very substantial. But I think it's irrelevant compared to the fact...
###1791 >> GINGRICH: No.
###1791 >> ROMNEY: ... that you were working for Freddie Mac.
###1793 >> GINGRICH: Wait a second. Wait a second. Very substantial.
###1793 >> ROMNEY: You were working for Freddie...
###1794 >> [CROSSTALK]
###1794 >> GINGRICH: Did Bain ever do any work with any company which did any work with the government,
###1798 like Medicare...
###1798 >> ROMNEY: We didn't -- we didn't do -- we didn't...
###1800 >> GINGRICH: ... Medicaid?
###1800 >> ROMNEY: We didn't do any work with the government. I didn't have an office on K Street.
###1802 I wasn't a lobbyist. I didn't -- had never worked -- I've never worked in Washington.
###1806 You were working...
###1806 >> GINGRICH: So -- so...
###1807 >> ROMNEY: We have congressmen who also say that you came and lobbied them in favor...
###1810 >> GINGRICH: I didn't lobby them.
###1811 >> ROMNEY: You have congressmen who say...
###1812 >> [CROSSTALK]
###1812 >> ROMNEY: ... that you came and lobbied them with regards to Medicare Part D, at the same
###1817 time...
###1817 >> GINGRICH: Now, wait. Whoa, whoa.
###1817 >> ROMNEY: ... your center was taking in contributions...
###1819 >> GINGRICH: You just jumped a long way over here, friend.
###1821 >> ROMNEY: Well, another -- another area of influence-peddling.
###1825 >> GINGRICH: No, not -- now, let me be very clear, because I understand your technique,
###1832 which you used on McCain, you used on Huckabee, you've used consistently, OK? It's unfortunate,
###1838 and it's not going to work very well, because the American people see through it. I have
###1842 always publicly favored a stronger Medicare program. I wrote a book in 2002 called "Saving
###1848 Lives and Saving Money." I publicly favored Medicare Part D for a practical reason, and
###1853 that reason is simple. The U.S. government was not prepared to give people anything -- insulin,
###1858 for example -- but they would pay for kidney dialysis. They weren't prepared to give people
###1863 Lipitor, but they'd pay for open-heart surgery. That is a terrible way to run Medicare. I
###1868 am proud of the fact -- and I'll say this in Florida -- I'm proud of the fact that I
###1871 publicly, openly advocated Medicare Part D. It has saved lives. It's run on a free enterprise
###1877 model. It also included health savings accounts and it include Medicare alternatives, which
###1882 gave people choices. And I did it publicly, and it is not correct, Mitt -- I'm just saying
###1887 this flatly, because you've been walking around this state saying things that are untrue -- it
###1890 is not correct to describe public citizenship, having public advocacy as lobbying. Every
###1896 citizen has the right to do that.
###1897 >> ROMNEY: They sure do.
###1898 >> GINGRICH: And what I did on behalf of Medicare...
###1899 >> ROMNEY: They sure do.
###1899 >> GINGRICH: ... I did out in the open, publicly, and that is my right as a citizen.
###1903 >> WILLIAMS: Gentlemen...
###1903 >> ROMNEY: Here's why it's a problem, Mr. Speaker. Here's why it's a problem. And that
###1907 is, if you're getting paid by health companies, if your entities are getting paid by health
###1912 companies that could benefit from a piece of legislation, and you then meet with Republican
###1917 congressmen and encourage them to support that legislation, you can call it whatever
###1920 you'd like. I call it influence-peddling. It is not right. It is not right. You have
###1923 a conflict. You are -- you are being paid by companies at the same time you're encouraging
###1926 people to pass legislation which is in their favor.
###1928 >> WILLIAMS: Governor...
###1928 >> ROMNEY: This is -- you spent now 15 years in Washington on K Street. And -- and this
###1930 is a real problem, if we're going to nominate someone who not only had a record of -- of
###1930 great distress as the speaker, but that has worked for 15 years lobbying.
###1931 >> WILLIAMS: Gentlemen, we've let this go because of the state of the race, and a certain
###1931 amount of this conversation, I guess, had to happen. We -- this also has to happen.
###1932 We have to go to a break. We'll come back. We'll talk about foreclosure. We'll talk about
###1932 foreign policy. We'll welcome in the other two gentlemen to this conversation when we
###1932 continue from Tampa.
###1932 >> [APPLAUSE]
###1932 >> [COMMERCIAL BREAK]
###1932 >> WILLIAMS: Welcome back to what has already become an interesting night in Tampa, Florida.
###1936 Gentlemen, welcome back to you. And, Senator Santorum, let's begin this segment with you.
###1942 Since we've been nibbling around the edges of the foreclosure crisis, since, what, 40
###1947 percent of homeowners in this state are underwater, 53 percent of the homes in Tampa, Florida,
###1952 are worth less today than before this crisis. Was it too easy? Did vehicles of the U.S.
###1960 government make it too easy to own a home in America?
###1962 >> SANTORUM: Well, the answer, unfortunately, is yes to that. And there were several of
###1966 us in the United States Senate back in 2005 and 2006 who saw this on the horizon, who
###1971 saw the problem with Freddie and Fannie, and tried to move forth with a bill -- I was on
###1975 the Banking Committee. We voted a bill out of committee to try to solve this problem,
###1979 to constrain Fannie and Freddie, and there were a lot of people out there fighting that,
###1984 including Harry Reid and his minions on the other side of the aisle. I sent -- I signed
###1988 a letter, along with 24 other senators, that said, we either do something now, stop the
###1992 filibuster of this bill, Harry Reid, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, all of whom were in the
###1997 Senate at the time. They were filibustering this bill to allow reform of Fannie and Freddie.
###2002 And we said, if this doesn't happen, if we don't constrain these two behemoths from continuing
###2007 to underwrite this subprime mortgage problem, then we're going to have a collapse. Unfortunately,
###2013 that proved -- proved to be true. The problem now is, what are you going to do about it?
###2016 And what I've said is that, as you heard me say before, let capitalism work. Allow these
###2021 -- allow these banks to -- to realize their losses. And create an opportunity for folks
###2026 who have houses to realize their losses and at least help them out. That's why I proposed
###2030 in my tax plan -- and I talk about five areas where I allow deductions -- well, one of them
###2035 would be, be able to deduct losses from the sale of your home. Right now, you can't do
###2038 that. You have to pay gains, depending on the amount, but you can't deduct the losses.
###2043 This is something I think is important temporarily to put in place to allow people the freedom
###2047 to be able to go out and get out from underneath these houses that they're holding onto and
###2052 at least get some relief from the federal government for doing so.
###2056 >> WILLIAMS: Congressman Paul, should that be any role for the government? Are those
###2059 folks owed anything for being under?
###2062 >> PAUL: Well, the government owes them a free market and a sound monetary system, but
###2066 they didn't give it to them. They gave them a mess. They gave them a financial system
###2070 that literally created this problem. And it was compounded -- first, the line of credit
###2075 to the -- to the Federal Reserve, it was excessive. Everybody now admits in Washington interest
###2080 rates were kept too low, too long. But not only that, in addition to that, it was an
###2084 insult to injury, because they kept interest rates especially low with Freddie Mac and
###2088 Fannie Mae, and there was a line of credit there, and it was a guarantee. As a matter
###2092 of fact, I had introduced legislation 10 years before the bubble burst to eliminate that
###2096 line of credit. But then the Community Reinvestment Act added more fuel to it, you know, forcing
###2102 banks to make loans that are risky loans. So the whole bubble was easily seen. The consequences
###2108 were anticipated. It was all government manufactured. But the question is, is what do you do after
###2114 you come upon a mess that the government and the politicians created? The best thing you
###2118 can do is get out of the way, because you want the prices to come down so that people
###2122 will start buying them again, but politicians can't allow that to happen. Our policies in
###2127 Washington still has been to try to stimulate houses and keep -- keep prices up.
###2132 >> PAUL: But this whole thing about how we get involved in this low interest rate to
###2136 stimulate the economy, almost everybody in Washington now in almost all spectrums of
###2141 the economic sphere do not believe in wage and price controls, but they believe in controlling
###2147 interest rates. That's one-half of the whole economy, and here we have a bunch of guys
###2152 getting in a room in secret, deciding what interest rates should be, and they create
###2156 this mess. So, yes, we need to get out of the way, but instead the debt has to be liquidated.
###2161 The mortgage derivatives was a monster. A lot of people made a lot of money on that.
###2165 But guess what? The Federal Reserve, to the tune of trillions and trillions of dollars,
###2170 as well as TARP funds, were used to bail out the people that made all this money. Guess
###2174 what happened to the bad debt? It should have been wiped off the book. They should have
###2177 gone bankrupt. It was dumped on the taxpayers, and the taxpayers still have it. And as long
###2182 as you maintain that debt on the books, you're not going to have growth. This is why Japan
###2186 hasn't recovered. We're in four years now, and it's going to continue until we understand
###2190 who creates the business cycle, how it happens, and what you have to do to get out of it.
###2195 >> WILLIAMS: Gentlemen, 30 seconds, please, on this, starting with Governor Romney. To
###2199 help these homeowners or not?
###2201 >> ROMNEY: To help them? Of course we help them. Pam Mati here in Florida is cracking
###2205 down on people who are committing fraud, number one. Number two, you have to get government
###2209 out of the mess. Government has created the mess. Number three, you're going to have to
###2213 help people see if they can't get more flexibility from their banks. Right now, with Dodd- Frank,
###2217 we made it harder for banks to renegotiate mortgages to help people get out. And finally,
###2222 you've got to get the economy going again with people having jobs. With Florida with
###2226 9.9 percent unemployment, and with 18 percent real unemployment in this state, and underemployment,
###2232 you're not going to get housing recovered unless you get jobs created again.
###2235 >> WILLIAMS: Speaker?
###2235 >> GINGRICH: Well, I think, first of all, if you could repeal Dodd- Frank tomorrow morning,
###2239 you would see the economy start to improve overnight. I mean, people don't realize this
###2243 bill is -- a little bit of what Congressman Paul said. The fact is Dodd-Frank has led
###2247 the biggest banks to get bigger. It is crushing independent banks. It has an anti-housing
###2253 bias. Federal regulators are slowing down and making it harder to make loans for housing,
###2258 and it is crippling small business borrowing. All those things are a function of a bill
###2262 passed by the Democrats called Dodd-Frank. If they would repeal it tomorrow morning,
###2267 you would have a better housing market the next day.
###2269 >> WILLIAMS: Do you really think the financial system is overregulated? That's the second
###2273 mention of Dodd-Frank tonight.
###2275 >> GINGRICH: I really think that when -- yes, of course it's overregulated. When you put
###2277 that much power in the Treasury under Geithner, you know, it's an invitation to corruption.
###2282 When you have a bias in the bill which makes the big banks get bigger, exactly the opposite
###2287 of what a rational policy would be, it's a bad bill. When you have regulators walk in
###2291 small local banks and say, do not loan money on housing, it's a bad idea.
###2295 >> WILLIAMS: Governor Romney, was it overregulated prior to the collapse?
###2298 >> ROMNEY: It was poorly regulated. Markets have to have regulation to work. You can't
###2303 have everybody open a bank in their garage. You have to have regulation, but it's got
###2307 to be up to date. And they didn't have capital requirements put in place for the different
###2311 classes of assets banks had. They also didn't have regulation properly put in place for
###2315 mortgage lenders. Derivatives weren't being regulated. You need to have regulation that's
###2320 up to date. They had old regulation, burdensome. Then they passed Dodd-Frank, which the Speaker
###2325 is absolutely right. It has made it almost impossible for community banks. I was with
###2330 the head of one of the big banks in New York. He said they have hundreds of lawyers working
###2334 on Dodd-Frank to implement it. Community banks don't have hundreds of lawyers. It's just
###2339 killing the residential home market and it's got to be replaced.
###2343 >> WILLIAMS: Governor Romney, let me ask you this. There was a lot of talk in the last
###2346 presidential campaign about that 3:00 a.m. phone call. Let's say President Romney gets
###2350 that phone call, and it is to say that Fidel Castro has died. And there are credible people
###2357 in the Pentagon who predict upwards of half a million Cubans may take that as a cue to
###2365 come to the United States. What do you do?
###2367 >> ROMNEY: Well, first of all, you thank heavens that Fidel Castro has returned to his maker
###2372 and will be sent to another land.
###2375 >> [APPLAUSE]
###2375 >> ROMNEY: Now, number two, you work very aggressively with the new leadership in Cuba
###2381 to try and move them towards a more open degree than they have had in the past. We just had,
###2387 with Wilman Villar, his life was just lost in a hunger strike fighting for democracy.
###2393 This president has taken a very dangerous course with regards to Cuba saying we're going
###2396 to relax relations, we're going to open up travel to Cuba. This is the wrong time for
###2400 that, with this kind of heroics going on. We want to stand with the people of Cuba that
###2405 want freedom. We want to move that effort forward not by giving in and saying we lost,
###2410 but by saying we will fight for democracy.
###2411 >> WILLIAMS: Mr. Speaker, as a practical matter, along the Florida coast, though, you know
###2416 the policy, so called wet foot/dry foot. What do you do if folks start arriving in the United
###2421 States?
###2422 >> GINGRICH: Well, Brian, first of all, I guess the only thing I would suggest is I
###2427 don't think that Fidel is going to meet his maker. I think he's going to go to the other
###2432 place. Second, I would suggest to you the policy of the United States should be aggressively
###2437 to overthrow the regime and to do everything we can to support those Cubans who want freedom.
###2442 You know, Obama is very infatuated with an Arab Spring. He doesn't seem to be able to
###2446 look 90 miles south of the United States to have a Cuban Spring. So I would try to put
###2451 in place a very aggressive policy of reaching out to every single Cuban who would like to
###2456 be free, helping network them together, reaching out to the younger generation inside the dictatorship,
###2461 and indicating they don't have a future as a dictatorship because a Gingrich presidency
###2466 will not tolerate four more years of this dictatorship.
###2469 >> WILLIAMS: Overt and covert, are you talking about engaging the U.S. military?
###2472 >> GINGRICH: No, I'm talking about using every asset available to the United States, including
###2476 appropriate covert operations, to maximize the distance, what Ronald Reagan, Pope John
###2480 Paul II, and Margaret Thatcher did to the Soviet empire, bring together every asset
###2485 we have to minimize the survival of the dictatorship and to maximize the chance for freedom in
###2490 Cuba.
###2490 >> WILLIAMS: Congressman?
###2492 >> PAUL: I -- I have a little bit of work to do yet on him on foreign policy.
###2496 >> [LAUGHTER]
###2497 >> [APPLAUSE]
###2498 >> PAUL: No, I would do pretty much the opposite. I don't like the isolationism of not talking
###2504 to people. I was drafted in 1962 at the height of the Cold War when the missiles were in
###2509 Cuba. And the Cold War's over. And I think we propped up Castro for 40-some years because
###2516 we put on these sanctions, and this -- only used us as a scapegoat. He could always say,
###2521 anything wrong, it's the United States' fault. But I think it's time -- time to quit this
###2525 isolation business of not talking to people. We talked to the Soviets. We talk to the Chinese.
###2531 And we opened up trade, and we're not killing each other now. We fought with the Vietnamese
###2536 for a long time. We finally gave up, started talking to them, now we trade with them. I
###2540 don't know why -- why the Cuban people should be so intimidating. I -- I don't know where
###2545 you get this assumption that all of a sudden all the Cubans would come up here. I would
###2548 probably think they were going to celebrate and they're going to have a lot more freedom
###2551 if we would only open up our doors and say, we want to talk to you, and trade with you,
###2557 and come visit. Sometimes they can't even send packages down there. I -- I think we're
###2561 living in the dark ages when we can't even talk to the Cuban people. I think it's not
###2567 1962 anymore. And we don't have to use force and intimidation and overthrow of a -- in
###2573 governments. I just don't think that's going to work.
###2574 >> WILLIAMS: Senator Santorum, an admittedly...
###2577 >> [APPLAUSE]
###2577 >> WILLIAMS: ... cynical question. If there was a strong lobby of Chinese dissidents living
###2582 in a state as politically important of -- as Florida, do you think we'd have a trade policy
###2589 with China that looks more like the trade policy with Cuba?
###2592 >> SANTORUM: Not if they were not 90 miles off our shore. This is an important doctrine
###2599 of the United States to make sure that our hemisphere and those who are close to us are
###2604 -- are folks that we can and should deal with. And right now, we have and have had for 50
###2609 years a dictatorship in Cuba. We've had sanctions on them. They should continue. They should
###2614 continue until the Castros are dead, and then we should make it very clear that if you want
###2619 mountains of aid, if you want normal relationships, if you want to improve your economy, if you
###2625 want to have the opportunity for freedom, that the United States stands ready now to
###2630 embrace you now that you've gotten rid of these tyrants who -- who have controlled you
###2634 for these 50-plus years. That's why the sanctions have to stay in place, because we need to
###2638 have a -- a very solid offer to come forward and help the Cuban people. And you're right,
###2642 Ron. It's not 1962. They're now with the Cubans and the Venezuelans, the Nicaraguans. There
###2649 is a growing network of folks now working with the jihadists, the Iranians, who are
###2655 very, very excited about the opportunity to having platforms 90 miles off our coast, just
###2660 like the Soviets were, very anxious to have platforms 90 miles off our coast, or in Venezuela,
###2666 or in Nicaragua, and other places they could come across the southern border. This is a
###2669 serious threat. It's a threat that I've been talking about for about six or seven years.
###2673 And it's one that's not going to go away until we -- we confront the threat and hopefully
###2679 are able to convince the Cuban people that, through what Newt and others have suggested,
###2684 to -- to change their government at the appropriate time.
###2686 >> WILLIAMS: Governor -- Governor Romney, last night, the Abe Lincoln, U.S. aircraft
###2690 carrier and a couple other attendant U.S. Navy vessels passed through the Strait of
###2695 Hormuz into the Persian Gulf. If Iran was able to fulfill, carry out that threat to
###2702 shut down the strait, would you consider that an act of war? What would you do about it
###2706 as president?
###2707 >> ROMNEY: Of -- of course it's an act of war. It is appropriate and -- and essential
###2711 for our military, for our Navy to -- to maintain open seas. We have control of the commons,
###2717 of space, air, and the seas. Our Navy has the capacity to do that -- or did in the past.
###2724 Under this president and under prior presidents, we keep on shrinking our Navy. Our Navy is
###2728 now smaller than any time since 1917. And -- and -- and the president is building roughly
###2733 nine ships a year. We ought to raise that to 15 ships a year, not because we want to
###2737 go to war with anyone, but because we don't want anyone to take the -- the -- the hazard
###2742 of going against us. We want them to see that we're so strong they couldn't possibly defeat
###2747 us. So we ought to have an aircraft carrier in the gulf, an aircraft carrier, and, of
###2751 course, the task force with it in the Mediterranean. We want to show Iran, any action of that nature
###2756 will be considered an act of war, an act of terror and -- and America is going to be keep
###2760 those sea lanes open.
###2761 >> WILLIAMS: So, Speaker Gingrich if you accept that bedrock definition that it is an act
###2765 of war, how do you gauge the appetite on the part of the American people after the better
###2771 part of a decade of warfare, fighting dual wars overseas for something like that?
###2778 >> GINGRICH: The American people have no interest in going to war anywhere. We had no interest
###2784 in going to war with the Japanese when they bombed Pearl Harbor. We had no interest in
###2787 going to Afghanistan when Jihadist's destroyed the World Trade Center. The fact is, we've
###2794 historically been a country that would like peace, we'd like stability. But we also have
###2799 a historic commitment to -- to freedom of the sea. And I would say that the most dangerous
###2804 thing, which by the way, Barack Obama just did, the -- the Iranians are practicing closing
###2810 the Straits of Hormuz, actively taunting us, so he cancels a military exercise with the
###2816 Israelis so as not to be provocative? Now, dictatorships respond to strength, they don't
###2823 respond to weakness and I think there's a very grave danger that the Iranians think
###2827 that in fact this president is so weak, they could close the Straits of Hormuz and not
###2832 suffer substantial consequences.
###2833 >> WILLIAMS: Governor Romney, how do you end a war in Afghanistan without talking to the
###2838 Taliban?
###2839 >> ROMNEY: By beating them. By standing behind our troops and making sure that -- that we
###2845 have transitioned to the Afghan military, a capacity for them to be successful in holding
###2850 off the Taliban. Our -- our mission there, is to be able to turn Afghanistan and it's
###2855 sovereignty over to a military of Afghan descent -- Afghan people that can defend their sovereignty.
###2863 And that is something which we can accomplish in the next couple of years. This president,
###2867 however, has done -- made -- made it very difficult for our troops to be able to be
###2870 successful in that mission by, number one, announcing a withdrawal date for our troops,
###2876 number two drawing down our surge troops faster than the time the commanders on the ground
###2880 was necessary. You don't draw them down during the middle of the fighting season. And finally,
###2885 by not overseeing elections in Afghanistan to assure that the -- the selection of their
###2889 president was seen by the people as being legitimate. And he has failed in -- in executing
###2894 a policy in Afghanistan that would optimize our prospects of success.
###2898 >> [CROSSTALK]
###2898 >> WILLIAMS: Go ahead. I was just going to ask, any appetite on this stage to negotiate
###2901 with the Taliban? Congressman?
###2902 >> PAUL: No, but I wanted to get involved in the discussion.
###2905 >> WILLIAMS: No, go ahead?
###2907 >> PAUL: Because the question was, you know, would you go to war? And Mitt said he would
###2912 -- he would go to war. But you have to think about the preliminary act that might cause
###2919 them to want to close the Straits of Hormuz, and that's the blockade. We're blockading
###2924 them. Can you imagine what we would do if somebody blockaded the Gulf of Mexico? That
###2929 would be an act of war. So the act of war has already been committed and this is a retaliation.
###2934 But besides, there's no interest whatsoever for Iran to close the Straits of Hormuz. I
###2939 mean they need it as much as we do. I mean so you have to put that into perspective.
###2943 But this whole idea that -- that it's -- we -- we have to go to war because we've already
###2950 committed an act by blockading the country and I -- I don't see -- I -- I -- and -- and
###2955 I think Newt is right. I think he's wrong about World War II, I think the people were
###2961 ready because we did it properly. We declared it and we won it quickly. But, not the people
###2965 are not ready. We don't have any money. We have too many wars. We -- the people want
###2970 to come home and they certainly don't want a hot war in Iran right now and I -- I think
###2975 that would be the most foolish thing in the world to do right now is take on Iran.
###2978 >> WILLIAMS: Right now for us another break. I'll welcome two colleagues out here to the
###2981 stage when we continue from Tampa right after this.
###2986 >> [COMMERCIAL BREAK]
###2992 >> WILLIAMS: And welcome back to Tampa. I am happy to welcome two fellow journalists
###3018 to this stage. Happy to be joined now by our partners in this debate. In fact, "The Tampa
###3022 Bay Times" and "National Journal." Adam Smith is the longtime political editor at "The Tampa
###3028 Bay Times," covering national, state and local politics for more than a decade, one of the
###3033 very best in the trade. And besides, a lot of people just thought a GOP debate should
###3037 have Adam Smith present. Beth Reinhard is a political correspondent for "National Journal."
###3044 She is a Florida native, was a veteran political reporter at "The Miami Herald" for 11 years.
###3049 But one piece of business, Senator Santorum, I had to go to a break. I didn't get you in
###3052 on what we'll call the Iran round, because you've talked about this a lot. Specifically,
###3058 as a last resort, as you said, taking out Iran's nuclear program. The problem with that,
###3065 so many in the military tell you, is the target list. Where do you limit it -- the air strikes
###3072 that some estimate would begin at 30 to 60 days sustained, taking out air defenses, all
###3079 of that familiar language the American people have just been through for a decade?
###3083 >> SANTORUM: Well, the contrast for that is, what happens if Iran gets a nuclear weapon
###3088 and the entire world changes? Iran is not just another country, or a little, small country,
###3093 as President Obama said classically during the campaign. Obama's Iran policy has been
###3100 a colossal failure. It's been a failure because he's not been true to the American public
###3104 about the threat that Iran poses to the world. Not just to Israel, but to the world and to
###3109 the United States. The bottom line is the theocracy that runs Iran is the equivalent
###3114 of having al Qaeda in charge of a country with huge oil reserves, gas reserves, and
###3119 a nuclear weapon. That is something that no president could possibly allow to have happen
###3124 under any circumstances. And when you asked the question, Brian, are we at --
###3152 is
###3163 this
###3190 is an act of war? Well, let's look at the acts of war that Iran -- they are -- they
###3193 are holding hostages, they are attacking our troops, their IEDs, the improvised explosive
###3198 devices, that are killing our troops in Afghanistan, and killed them in Iraq, and maimed so many
###3203 were produced, and people were trained and funded in Iran specifically to kill American
###3209 troops. You look at the ships that have been attacked by Iran, embassies were attacked
###3213 by Iran. A -- Iran has plotted to kill the Saudi ambassador here in this country. It
###3218 is a long list of attacks of -- of warlike behavior on the part of this regime. And to
###3225 believe that if they have a nuclear weapon they're somehow going to become into the community
###3230 of nations is a reckless act on the part of a president. It would be reckless not to do
###3235 something to stop them from getting this nuclear weapon.
###3238 >> WILLIAMS: Senator, thank you. And to interests of local state politics, Beth Reinhard will
###3246 take over the questioning.
###3247 >> REINHARD: Senator Santorum, here in Florida, BP is still airing apologetic appeals on television,
###3254 but there are proposals to expand offshore oil drilling. The state's most optimistic
###3259 estimates say more drilling would create 5,000 jobs, but an oil spill would threaten Florida's
###3265 tourism industry, which employs nearly 1 million people. Is that worth the risk?
###3270 >> SANTORUM: What threatens the tourist industry in Florida, as we've seen, is a very bad economy,
###3275 and a very bad economy that became a bad economy why? Because of a huge spike in oil prices
###3280 in the summer of 2008. So energy is absolutely key to keep all of our country healthy, specifically
###3287 Florida, which is a destination place. This is a -- this is a place that relies upon people
###3293 being able to travel and afford to be able to travel to come down here, relies upon an
###3297 economy being strong. I was at a manufacturer in Sarasota County today and was talking about
###3302 them as a manufacturer and that, you know, the -- the importance of manufacturing jobs,
###3307 yes, even here in the state of Florida, and the price of energy for them to be able to
###3311 be competitive. It is absolutely essential that we have as much domestic supply of oil,
###3317 that we build the Keystone pipeline, that we create the jobs that -- that that would
###3322 create, and provide oil from domestic sources. Pipelines that run on the floor of the sea
###3327 or pipelines that come through America are the safest way to transport oil. It is tankers
###3333 that are causing -- that cause much more problems. Pipelines are the safe way. Building those
###3338 rigs, piping that oil into -- into -- into our shore is the best way to create a good
###3343 economy for the state of Florida.
###3345 >> REINHARD: All of you favor making English the official language of the United States,
###3350 which could mean that ballots and other government documents would not be available in Spanish.
###3355 But, Speaker Gingrich, you're sending out press releases in Spanish; Governor Romney,
###3359 you're advertising in Spanish. Why is it OK for you to court voters in Spanish, but not
###3364 OK for the government to serve them in Spanish? Speaker Gingrich?
###3368 >> GINGRICH: Well, first of all, you immediately jump down to a very important language, but
###3374 not the only language. The challenge of the United States is simple. There are 86 languages
###3378 in Miami Dade College, 86. There are over 200 languages spoken in Chicago. Now, how
###3385 do you unify the country? What -- what is the common bond that enables people to be
###3390 both citizens and to rise commercially and have a better life and a greater opportunity?
###3395 I think campaigning, historically, you've always been willing to go to people on their
###3400 terms in their culture, whether it's Greek Independence Day or something you did for
###3405 the Irish on St. Patrick's Day. And I'm perfectly happy to be on Radio Mambi, and I'm perfectly
###3410 happy to have a lot of support in the Hispanic community. But as a country to unify ourselves
###3417 in a future in which there may well be 300 or 400 languages spoken in the United States,
###3423 I think it is essential to have a central language that we expect people to learn and
###3428 to be able to communicate with each other in.
###3429 >> REINHARD: So to be clear, you would only have ballots in English?
###3431 >> GINGRICH: I would have ballots in English. And I think you could have programs where
###3435 virtually everybody would be able to read the ballots.
###3437 >> REINHARD: Governor Romney, can you take that question?
###3439 >> ROMNEY: I think Speaker Gingrich is right with regards to what he's described. I'd note
###3442 that in my state we had a tradition of teaching people in the language of their birth, and
###3448 so we had in our school systems people being taught in a whole range of languages. And
###3453 we had to have teachers that could teach in Cambodian, in Vietnamese, and other languages.
###3457 And our kids were being taught in foreign languages in our own schools. And we found
###3462 at the end of their education experience they couldn't all speak English well. It made absolutely
###3466 no sense. And so we campaigned for English immersion in our schools and said kids coming
###3472 in will have a transition period. Then we're going to teach them in English. Look, English
###3476 is the language of this nation. People need to learn English to be able to be successful,
###3480 to get great jobs. We don't want to have people limited in their capacity to achieve the American
###3485 dream because they don't speak English. And so encouraging people through every means
###3489 possible to learn the language of America is a good idea. Recognize at the same time
###3495 we want people coming here from other cultures that speak other languages. That strengthens
###3499 America. It's a great thing. But having them learn English is also a great thing for them
###3504 and for their kids.
###3505 >> REINHARD: Congressman Paul?
###3507 >> PAUL: Yes, my answer is similar, but a little bit different, because at the national
###3512 level, obviously we have to have one language. I mean, we can't have multiple languages.
###3516 So, for legal reasons, we would have one language. But our system really gives us a way to be
###3522 more generous, because if Florida wanted to have some ballots in Spanish, I certainly
###3526 wouldn't support a federal law that would prohibit Florida from accommodating a city
###3531 election or a local election or a state election. I think that's the magnificence of our system,
###3536 where you can solve some of these problems without dictating one answer for all states.
###3542 But nationally, we should have one language.
###3544 >> REINHARD: Speaker Gingrich, I want to move on to a slightly different topic, the Dream
###3547 Act, which, as you know, would provide a pathway to citizenship for children who have been
###3552 brought to the U.S. illegally if they attend college or enroll in the military. Now, Governor
###3558 Romney and Senator Santorum have both said they would veto this legislation. Would you
###3561 do the same?
###3562 >> GINGRICH: No. I would work to get a signable version which would be the military component.
###3568 I think any young person living in the United States who happened to have been brought here
###3572 by their parents when they were young should have the same opportunity to join the American
###3577 military and earn citizenship which they would have had from back home. We have a clear provision
###3582 that if you live in a foreign country, and you are prepared to join the American military,
###3587 you can, in fact, earn the right to citizenship by serving the United States and taking real
###3591 risk on behalf of the United States. That part of the Dream Act I would support. I would
###3597 not support the part that simply says everybody who goes to college is automatically waived
###3601 for having broken the law.
###3602 >> REINHARD: The questioning continues.
###3603 >> ROMNEY: I just doubt that's the same position that I have, and that is that I would not
###3607 sign the Dream Act as it currently exists, but I would sign the Dream Act if it were
###3613 focused on military service.
###3614 >> WILLIAMS: Thank you, Governor. Questioning continues with Adam Smith.
###3617 >> SMITH: Let's stay on immigration for a second. Governor Romney, there is one thing
###3620 I'm confused about. You say you don't want to go and round up people and deport them,
###3624 but you also say that they would have to go back to their home countries and then apply
###3627 for citizenship. So, if you don't deport them, how do you send them home?
###3630 >> ROMNEY: Well, the answer is self-deportation, which is people decide they can do better
###3634 by going home because they can't find work here because they don't have legal documentation
###3638 to allow them to work here. And so we're not going to round people up. The way that we
###3642 have in this society is to say, look, people who have come here legally would, under my
###3647 plan, be given a transition period and the opportunity during that transition period
###3651 to work here, but when that transition period was over, they would no longer have the documentation
###3656 to allow them to work in this country. At that point, they can decide whether to remain
###3660 or whether to return home and to apply for legal residency in the United States, get
###3665 in line with everybody else. And I know people think but that's not fair to those that have
###3669 come here illegally.
###3669 >> SMITH: Isn't that what we have now? If somebody doesn't feel they have the opportunity
###3674 in America, they can go back any time they want to.
###3675 >> ROMNEY: Yes, we'd have a card that indicates who's here illegally. And if people are not
###3680 able to have a card, and have through an E-Verify system determine that they are here illegally,
###3684 then they're going to find they can't get work here. And if people don't get work here,
###3687 they're going to self-deport to a place where they can get work. Ultimately, with this transition
###3692 period in place, we would then allow people to get in line at home and to come back to
###3697 this country after they have reached the front of the line. But I just don't think it's fair
###3701 to the people who have loved ones waiting in line legally to come to America and say,
###3705 guess what? We're going to encourage a wave of illegal immigration by giving amnesty of
###3710 some kind to those who have come here illegally.
###3712 >> SMITH: Senator Santorum, is self-deportation. Is that a valid concept?
###3716 >> SANTORUM: Well, it's happening now. I mean, people are going back now because they can't
###3719 find jobs because of the lack of employment opportunities. The bottom line is, is that
###3724 if you do enforce the law and say that people who are here illegally, who are doing illegal
###3730 acts -- and that is working, which you're not allowed to do -- and if you're working,
###3734 probably you've stolen someone's Social Security number, which you are not allowed to do -- and
###3737 that's another law that is broken -- that we should enforce the law. It's not someone
###3742 who has come here illegally in the first place and they've only broken the law once. They
###3746 continually break the law in this country, and I don't think that's not something that
###3750 should be rewarded. My father came to this country, my grandfather came to this country.
###3755 He left my dad behind for five years. My dad was without a dad for almost the first five
###3760 years of his life. And there are millions of stories across America of people making
###3765 sacrifices because America was worth it to do it the right way. You come to this country
###3769 and the first thing you do is to respect our laws. If you want to be an American, you respect
###3774 the laws of America, and you do so continually while you're here. We reward that kind of
###3779 behavior. We don't reward behavior where you don't respect our laws in your initial act
###3784 and then you continually break the laws in order to stay here.
###3787 >> SMITH: Speaker Gingrich, in Iowa you were a big supporter of ethanol subsidies. Here
###3791 in Florida, sugar is a very important industry, and it's subsidized, as well, with import
###3795 restrictions, quotas. There's a conservative movement to do away with these programs. In
###3800 the case of sugar, critics say it -- it adds billions of dollars to -- to consumers' grocery
###3805 bills every year. What would you do about that?
###3807 >> GINGRICH: Well, I pretty enthusiastically early in my career kept trying to figure out
###3810 how to get away from the sugar subsidy. And I found out one of -- one of the fascinating
###3814 things about America, which was that cane sugar hides behind beet sugar. And there are
###3819 just too many beet sugar districts in the United States. It's an amazing side story
###3824 about how interest groups operate. In an ideal world, you would have an open market. And
###3830 that's -- I think that would be a better future and, frankly, one where cane sugar would still
###3834 make a lot of money. But it's very hard to imagine how you're going to get there. I spent
###3838 a lot of time trying to reform agriculture when I was speaker. And I would say it was
###3842 one of the two or three hardest things to try to do because the -- the capacity of the
###3846 agricultural groups to defend themselves is pretty amazing.
###3849 >> SMITH: Governor Romney, you're going some campaign support from sugar growers. It's
###3852 a very influential group in this state. What's your view on the sugar subsidies?
###3855 >> ROMNEY: Yeah, my view is, we ought to get rid of subsidies and let markets work properly.
###3859 But let's step back for a second, talk about what's really going on in Florida right now.
###3863 And you know, you both know what's going on here. I spent time this morning with -- with
###3867 eight different individuals, listening to them talk about their circumstances. There
###3871 are a lot of people in Florida that are hurting. You got a lot of homes underwater. This president
###3875 came into office saying he'd turn this economy around, and everything he has done has made
###3880 it harder for the people of Florida. We have 25 million Americans out of work. We have,
###3886 in Florida, 9.9 percent unemployed. We have 18 percent of our people in this state that
###3892 are underemployed. Home values, 40 percent are underwater. This president has failed
###3897 miserably the people of Florida. His plans for NASA, he has no plans for NASA. The space
###3901 coast is -- is struggling. This president has failed the people of Florida. We have
###3907 to have a president who understands how to get an economy going again. He does not. He
###3911 plays 90 rounds of golf when you have 25 million people out of work. He says gasoline prices
###3917 doubled during his presidency. He says don't build a Keystone pipeline. We have $15 trillion
###3922 of debt. We're headed to a -- to a Greece- type collapse, and he adds another trillion
###3926 on top for Obamacare and for his stimulus plan that didn't create private-sector jobs.
###3931 This president has failed. And this economy needs a president who understands this economy.
###3936 >> SMITH: Congressman Paul, Florida's Everglades provide one in three Floridians with their
###3939 drinking water. It affects thousands of jobs. Right now, there's a -- there's a joint federal-state
###3943 program to save what's left of the Everglades. Would you commit to continuing that federal
###3948 financing of the Everglades preservation?
###3950 >> PAUL: Sure. I -- I don't see any reason to go after that. I would still look into
###3954 the details on whether that could be a state issue or not. But with all the wars going
###3959 on, and the economy is in shambles, as it is, and the unemployment, to -- to worry about
###3965 dealing with that program, we could do it in a theoretical sense. But I would see no
###3969 reason to, you know, complicate things. But I wouldn't have any desire to interfere with
###3976 that.
###3976 >> WILLIAMS: At this point, we'll take another break. We'll return from Tampa with this line
###3982 of questioning right after this.
###3985 >> [APPLAUSE]
###3985 >> [COMMERCIAL BREAK]
###3986 >> WILLIAMS: We are back from Tampa tonight. As the conversation continues, once again
###3992 the questioning continues. Adam Smith of "The Tampa Bay Times."
###4005 >> SMITH: Thank you. Senator Santorum, in 2005, Florida was in the middle of a huge
###4010 national debate over Terri Schiavo, whether her feeding tube should be removed after the
###4014 courts had ruled that she had been in a vegetative state for years. You were at the center, at
###4019 the front of advocating congressional intervention to keep her alive. You even came down here,
###4024 came to her bedside after a fund-raiser. Why should the government have more say in medical
###4030 decisions like that than a spouse?
###4032 >> SANTORUM: Well, number one, I didn't come to her bedside, but I did come down to Tampa.
###4035 I was scheduled to come down anyway for that event, and it so happened that this situation
###4040 was going on. I did not call for congressional intervention. I called for a judicial hearing
###4046 by an impartial judge at the federal level to review a case in which you had parents
###4053 and a spouse on different sides of the issue. And these were constituents of mine. The parents
###4059 happen to live in Pennsylvania, and they came to me and made a very strong case that they
###4064 would like to see some other pair of eyes, judicial eyes, look at it. And I agreed to
###4069 advocate for those constituents because I believe that we should give respect and dignity
###4076 for all human life, irrespective of their condition. And if there was someone there
###4080 that wanted to provide and take care of them, and they were willing to do so, I wanted to
###4084 make sure that the judicial proceedings worked properly. And that's what I did, and I would
###4088 do it again.
###4090 >> SMITH: Do not resuscitate directives, do you think they're immoral?
###4096 >> SANTORUM: No, I don't believe they're immoral. I mean, I think that's a decision that people
###4101 should be able to make, and I have supported legislation in the past for them to make it.
###4106 >> SMITH: Speaker Gingrich, in that case the courts had ruled repeatedly. How does that
###4110 square, the Terri Schiavo, action with your understanding of the Constitution and separation
###4114 of powers?
###4114 >> GINGRICH: Well, look, I think that we go to extraordinary lengths, for example, for
###4120 people who are on murderers row. They have extraordinary rights of appeal. And you have
###4125 here somebody who was in a coma, who had, on the one hand, her husband saying let her
###4130 die and her parents saying let her live. Now, it strikes me that having a bias in favor
###4135 of life, and at least going to a federal hearing, which would be automatic if it was a criminal
###4141 on death row, that it's not too much to say in some circumstances your rights as an American
###4146 citizen ought to be respected. And there ought to be at least a judicial review of whether
###4151 or not in that circumstance you should be allowed to die, which has nothing to do with
###4156 whether or not you as a citizen have a right to have your own end-of-life prescription
###4162 which is totally appropriate for you to do as a matter of your values in consultation
###4166 with your doctor.
###4167 >> SMITH: Congressman Paul, you're a doctor. What was your view of the Terri Schiavo case?
###4171 >> PAUL: I find it so unfortunate, so unusual, too. That situation doesn't come up very often.
###4177 It should teach us all a lesson to have living wills or a good conversation with a spouse.
###4184 I would want my spouse to make the decision. And -- but it's better to have a living will.
###4190 But I don't like going up the ladder. You know, we go to the federal courts, and the
###4195 Congress, and on up. Yes, difficult decisions. Will it be perfect for everybody? No. But
###4200 I would have preferred to see the decision made at the state level. But I've been involved
###4205 in medicine with things similar, but not quite as difficult as this. But usually, we deferred
###4211 to the family. And it wasn't made a big issue like this was. This was way out of proportion
###4219 to what happens more routinely. But I think it should urge us all to try to plan for this
###4224 and make sure either that one individual that's closest to you makes the decision or you sign
###4230 a living will. And this would have solved the whole problem.
###4233 >> SMITH: Beth?
###4234 >> REINHARD: Governor Romney, this is the state that put the first men on the moon.
###4239 America right now has no way to put people into space except to hitch a ride with the
###4243 Russians. Meanwhile, the Chinese are ramping up their space program. At a time when you
###4248 all want to shrink federal spending, should space exploration be a priority? Governor
###4253 Romney?
###4253 >> ROMNEY: It should certainly be a priority. What we have right now is a president who
###4257 does not have a vision or a mission for NASA. And as a result of that, there are people
###4262 on the space coast that are suffering. And Florida itself is -- is suffering as a result.
###4266 So what's the right way forward? Well, I happen to believe our space program is important
###4271 not only for science, but also for commercial development and for military development.
###4275 And I believe the right mission for -- for NASA should be determined by a president together
###4279 with a collection of people from those different areas, from NASA, from the Air Force space
###4284 program, from our leading universities, and from commercial enterprises, bring them together,
###4290 discuss a wide range of options for NASA, and then -- and then have NASA not just funded
###4294 by the federal government, but also by commercial enterprises. Have some of the research done
###4298 in our universities. Let's have a collaborative effort with business, with -- with government,
###4303 with a military, as well as with our educational institutions. Have a mission, once again excite
###4308 our young people about the potential of space and the commercial potential will pay for
###4313 itself down the road. This is a great opportunity. Florida has technology. The people here on
###4318 the space coast have technology and vision and passion that America needs. And with a
###4323 president that is actually willing to create a mission and a vision for -- for NASA and
###4328 for space, we can continue to lead the world.
###4330 >> REINHARD: Speaker Gingrich, would you put more tax dollars into the space race and commit
###4335 to putting an American on Mars, instead of relying on the private sector?
###4339 >> GINGRICH: Well, the two are not incompatible. For example, most of the great breakthroughs
###4346 in aviation in the '20s and '30s were as a result of prizes. Lindbergh flew to Paris
###4351 for a $25,000 prize. I would like to see vastly more of the money spent encouraging the private
###4357 sector into very aggressive experimentation. And I'd like a leaner NASA. I don't think
###4363 building a bigger bureaucracy and having a greater number of people sit in rooms and
###4367 talk gets you there. But if we had a series of goals that we were prepared to offer prizes
###4372 for, there's every reason to believe you have a lot of folks in this country and around
###4376 the world who would put up an amazing amount of money and would make the space coast literally
###4380 hum with activity because they'd be drawn to achieve these prizes. Going back to the
###4386 moon permanently, getting to Mars as rapidly as possible, building a series of space stations
###4391 and developing commercial space, there are a whole series of things you can do that could
###4395 be dynamic that are more than just better government bureaucracy. They're fundamentally
###4399 leapfrogging into a world where you're incentivizing people who are visionaries and people in the
###4404 private sector to invest very large amounts of money in finding very romantic and exciting
###4410 futures.
###4410 >> REINHARD: Speaker Gingrich, I have another question for you on another topic. You've
###4414 talked about the millions of jobs created by the Reagan tax cuts. If tax cuts create
###4420 jobs, why didn't the Bush tax cuts work?
###4422 >> GINGRICH: Well, the Bush tax cuts, I think in a period of great difficulty, with the
###4426 attack of 9/11, actually stopped us from going into a much deeper slump. I think we would
###4431 have been in much, much worse shape, and I think most economists agree, that in 2002
###4434 and '03 and '04 we'd have been in much worse shape without the Bush tax cuts. But -- but
###4439 you have to also look at the regulatory burden. The reason I called for repealing Dodd-Frank
###4443 and for repealing Obamacare and for repealing Sarbanes-Oxley is you now have these huge
###4448 layers of paperwork and government intervention and bureaucratic micromanagement that are
###4453 crippling the American system and are making it much harder for us to create the kind of
###4457 jobs we'd want. In North Dakota today, we have a boom in oil development, unemployment
###4463 is down to 3.2 percent. They have had seven straight tax cuts at the state level because
###4468 the oil was on private land. If that oil had been on public land, the environmentalists
###4473 and Barack Obama would have stopped its development, and North Dakota would be mired in 8 percent
###4478 or 9 percent unemployment. So, get the regulations out of the way, get the tax incentives right,
###4483 and you can get back to creating an amazing number of jobs very fast.
###4486 >> WILLIAMS: To my fellow questioners, our panelists tonight, my thanks. So ends this
###4491 section of our conversation. The final bit of our debate from Tampa tonight coming up
###4497 after this last break.
###4502 >> [COMMERCIAL BREAK]
###4505 >> WILLIAMS: Welcome back to Tampa for this final section of our conversation tonight.
###4517 We're back down to the five of us here on stage. I thought we'd talk a little bit more
###4521 big picture. This has been called, in addition to this unprecedented primary contest the
###4528 GOP is in the midst of, a battle for the soul of the Republican Party. Governor Romney,
###4534 the question is, about that soul, what have you done to further the cause of conservativism
###4542 as a Republican leader?
###4543 >> ROMNEY: Well, number one, I've raised a family. And I've -- I've -- with my wife,
###4548 we've raised five wonderful sons, and we have 16 wonderful grandkids. Number two, I've worked
###4554 in the private sector. The idea that somehow everything important for conservativism or
###4558 for America happens in government is simply wrong. I've been in the private sector. I
###4562 worked in one business that was in trouble and helped turn it around. Another I started.
###4566 And as part of that, we were able to create thousands and thousands of jobs. And then
###4570 I took an opportunity to become governor of a state that was slightly Democrat. About
###4574 85 percent of my legislature was Democrat. And I worked very hard to promote a conservative
###4580 agenda. We cut taxes 19 times. We balanced the budget every year, put in place a rainy
###4585 day fund of over $2 billion by the time I left. We were also successful in having English
###4590 immersion in our schools, driving our schools to be number one in the nation. That kind
###4594 of conservative model in a state like Massachusetts was a model in many respects that other states
###4599 could look at and say, "OK, conservative principles work." We were able to reach across the aisle
###4604 to fight for conservative principles, and now I'm taking that to a presidential campaign,
###4608 wrote a book about those principles that lay out why I believe they're right for America.
###4612 >> WILLIAMS: Mr. Speaker, you've been talking a lot about conservative principles in this
###4615 campaign so far. Is that enough for you? Is that good enough?
###4618 >> GINGRICH: Look, I don't want to spend my time commenting on Mitt. I'd like to just
###4622 tell you that I started -- I went to a Goldwater organizing session in 1964. I met with Ronald
###4627 Reagan for the first time in 1974. I worked with Jack Kemp and Art Laffer and others to
###4632 develop supply-side economics in the late '70s. I helped Governor Reagan become President
###4636 Reagan. I helped pass the Reagan economic program when I worked with the National Security
###4641 Council on issues involving the collapse of the Soviet empire. I then came back, organized
###4646 a group called GOPAC, spent 16 years building a majority in the House for the first time
###4650 since 1954, the first re-elected majority since 1928, developed the Conservative Opportunity
###4657 Society, talked about big ideas, big solutions. So I think it's fair to say I've spent most
###4661 of my lifetime trying to develop a conservative movement across this country that relates
###4667 directly to what we have to do. And I think only a genuine conservative who's in a position
###4672 to debate Obama and to show how wide the gap is between Obama's policies and conservativism
###4678 can, in fact, win, because he's going to spend a billion dollars trying to smear whoever
###4682 the nominee is. And we'd better be prepared to beat him in the debate and prove exactly
###4687 how wrong his values are and how wrong his practices are.
###4690 >> WILLIAMS: Which, Senator Santorum, gets us back to electability, the gap between the
###4696 Republican Party and the president. Some of the newspaper headlines about this gathering
###4700 we were going to have tonight, in Florida, Romney seeks to link Gingrich to foreclosure
###4705 crisis. And here's a second one: The verdict is in, Mitt Romney's Bain Capital problem
###4710 is real. What's the net effect of all this, of the tax release tomorrow, of Freddie -- the
###4715 Freddie Mac release tonight on your party, say your candidacy, as you try to go forward?
###4721 >> SANTORUM: Well, I would say that there are more fundamental issues than that, where
###4724 there's a gap and a problem with two of the gentlemen who are up here with me. And one
###4729 is on the biggest issue that they -- we have to deal with in this election, that's -- that's
###4733 crushing the economy, will crush it even further and crush freedom, and that's Obamacare. Governor
###4738 Romney's plan in Massachusetts was the basis for Obamacare. Speaker Gingrich for 20 years
###4743 supported a federal individual mandate, something that Pam Bondi is now going to the Supreme
###4748 Court saying is unconstitutional. Speaker Gingrich, for 20 years, up until last year
###4753 supported an individual mandate, which is at the core of Obamacare. If you look at cap-and-trade,
###4759 Governor Romney was very proud to say that he was the first state in the country as governor
###4762 to sign a cap on CO-2 emissions, the first state in the country to put a cap believing
###4768 in -- in global warming and criticized Republicans for not believing in it, as did, by the way,
###4773 Speaker Gingrich, who was for a cap-and-trade program with incentives, business incentives,
###4778 but was for the rubric of cap-and-trade, not specifically the cap-and-trade bill that was
###4782 out there. Again, huge, huge differences between my position and where President Obama is,
###4789 but not so on two major issues. You go down and you look at the Wall Street bailouts,
###4793 I said before, here's one where you had folks who preach conservativism, private sector,
###4798 and when push came to shove, they got pushed. They didn't stand tall for the conservative
###4803 principles that they argued that they were for. And as a result, we ended up with this
###4807 bailout that has injected government into business like it had never been done before.
###4812 >> SANTORUM: They rejected conservativism when it was hard to stand. It's going to be
###4816 hard to stand whoever this president is going to be elected. It's going to be tough. There
###4820 is going to be a mountain of problems. It's going to be easy to be able to bail out and
###4825 compromise your principles. We have gentlemen here on the three issues that got the Tea
###4829 Party started, that are the base of the conservative movement now in the Republican Party. And
###4834 there is no difference between President Obama and these two gentlemen. And that's why this
###4839 election in Florida is so critical, that we have someone that actually can create a contrast
###4844 between the president and the conservative point of view.
###4847 >> WILLIAMS: Congressmen Paul, are the two men in the middle insufficiently conservative
###4851 for you?
###4852 >> PAUL: Well, I think the problem is, is nobody has defined what being conservative
###4857 means.
###4857 >> WILLIAMS: Go ahead.
###4857 >> PAUL: And I think that is our problem. Conservative means we have a smaller government
###4861 and more liberty. And yet, if you ask, what have we done? I think we have lost our way.
###4867 Our rhetoric is still pretty good, but when we get in charge, we expand the government.
###4871 You talk about Dodd-Frank, but we gave Sarbanes-Oxley. We gave debts as well, you know, when we're
###4877 in charge. So, if it means limited government, you have to ask the basic question, what should
###4881 the role of government be? The founders asked that question, had a revolution and wrote
###4884 a Constitution. And they said the role of government ought to be to protect liberty.
###4889 It's not to run a welfare state and not to be the policemen of the world. And so if you're
###4894 a conservative, how can you be conservative and cut food stamps, but you won't cut spending
###4900 overseas? There is not a nickel or a penny that anybody will cut on the conservative
###4904 side, overseas spending. And we don't have the money. They are willing to start more
###4908 wars. So, I say, if you're conservative, you want small government across the board, especially
###4912 in personal liberty. What's wrong with having the government out of our personal lives?
###4917 So, this is what -- we have to decide what conservative means, what limited government
###4922 means. And I have a simple suggestion. We have a pretty good guide, and if we follow
###4926 the Constitution, government would be very small and we would all be devoted conservatives.
###4930 >> WILLIAMS: Governor Romney, again tonight, so called Romneycare and so-called Obamacare
###4935 have been positioned very closely side by side by your opponent, the senator. And again,
###4941 you have been called insufficiently conservative.
###4943 >> ROMNEY: You know, I have a record. You can look at my record. I just described what
###4947 I had accomplished in Massachusetts. It's a conservative record. Also, the fun of running
###4951 against Ted Kennedy. What a great thrill that was. I didn't beat him, but he had to take
###4955 a mortgage out on his house to make sure that he could defeat me. I believe that the policies
###4959 he put in place had hurt America and helped create a permanent underclass in this country.
###4964 My health care plan, by the way, is one that under our Constitution we're allowed to have.
###4968 The people in our state chose a plan which I think is working for our state. At the time
###4972 we crafted it, I was asked time and again, "Is this something that you would have the
###4975 federal government do?" I said absolutely not. I do not support a federal mandate. I
###4981 do not support a federal one-size-fits-all plan. I believe in the Constitution. That's
###4985 why the attorney general here is saying absolutely not. You can't impose Obamacare on the states.
###4991 What I will do if I'm president, I will repeal Obamacare and return to the states the authority
###4996 and the rights the states have to craft their own programs to care for their own poor.
###5000 >> WILLIAMS: Speaker Gingrich, I know none of you believe in polls, but as we came in
###5004 here tonight, of the numbers in the known world, your numbers were on the rise. What
###5011 scares you about the presidency if you made it to the job you want?
###5017 >> GINGRICH: I actually agree with what Rick Santorum said. I believe that whoever the
###5022 next president is, if we're going to get America back on the right track, is going to face
###5028 enormous, difficult problems, some of which have been accurately diagnosed by Dr. Paul.
###5035 And the fact is that we have tremendous institutional biases against doing the right thing and against
###5043 getting things done. And we have huge interest groups who would rather preside over the wreckage
###5049 than lose their favored position by helping the country. So I always tell audiences I
###5053 never ask anyone to be for me. Because if they are for me, they vote yes and go home
###5057 and say, I sure hope Newt does it. I ask people to be with me, because I think this will be
###5061 a very hard, very difficult journey. And I find it a very humbling and a very sobering
###5067 thought that one would have to try to get America back on the right track despite all
###5071 of our elites and all of our entrenched bureaucracies.
###5073 >> WILLIAMS: Governor Romney, you talk about restoring America's greatness. Given that,
###5079 in your view when was America last great?
###5084 >> ROMNEY: America still is great, but we have a lot of people suffering. We have people
###5090 that are underemployed that shouldn't be, unemployed that shouldn't be. Home values
###5093 continue to go down. We have the median income in this country has declined 10 percent in
###5098 the last four years. We're still a great nation, but a great nation doesn't have so many people
###5102 suffering. And I'm running in part because I have experience in how the economy works.
###5108 And I want to use that experience to get people working again, to get our economy working
###5113 again. And the idea to get our economy working is not to have the government play a more
###5117 intrusive role in how our economy works, but instead to do the seven things that always
###5122 get an economy going: get taxes competitive, regulation as modest as possible and modernized,
###5128 get ourselves energy independent, open up trade with other nations and crack down on
###5132 cheaters, make sure we don't have crony capitalism -- that's what we have going on right now
###5136 -- build human capital through education, and also finally balance the budget. People
###5141 will not invest in an economy and create new jobs if they think we're going to hit a Greece-like
###5146 wall. I will do those seven things and get America working again.
###5150 >> WILLIAMS: I want to thank all of our candidates and our hosts, of course, here at the University
###5155 of South Florida. We are obligated at this point to say, "Go Bulls."
###5158 >> [APPLAUSE]
###5158 >> WILLIAMS: For our hosts here, for our viewers here on your NBC station, our coverage will
###5158 continue. I'll be back with you shortly. But for now, let's go over to David Gregory to
###5158 take a look at part of what transpired here on stage tonight with our thanks to you all.
###5158 Thank you very much.
