0:0:3,4 --> 0:0:7,29
MARTHA RADDATZ: Good evening, and welcome
to the first and only vice presidential debate


2
0:0:7,29 --> 0:0:14,24
of 2012, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential
Debates. I’m Martha Raddatz of ABC News,


3
0:0:14,24 --> 0:0:19,95
and I am honored to moderate this debate between
two men who have dedicated much of their lives


4
0:0:19,95 --> 0:0:21,36
to public service.


5
0:0:21,36 --> 0:0:26,79
Tonight’s debate is divided between domestic
and foreign policy issues.


6
0:0:26,79 --> 0:0:29,95
And I’m going to move back and forth between
foreign and domestic since that is what a


7
0:0:29,95 --> 0:0:32,98
vice president or president would have to
do.


8
0:0:32,98 --> 0:0:37,69
We will have nine different segments. At the
beginning of each segment, I will ask both


9
0:0:37,69 --> 0:0:42,98
candidates a question, and they will each
have two minutes to answer. Then I will encourage


10
0:0:42,98 --> 0:0:48,81
a discussion between the candidates with follow-up
questions. By coin toss, it has been determined


11
0:0:48,81 --> 0:0:53,37
that Vice President Biden will be first to
answer the opening question.


12
0:0:53,37 --> 0:0:57,37
We have a wonderful audience here at Centre
College tonight. You will no doubt hear their


13
0:0:57,37 --> 0:1:4,49
enthusiasm at the end of the debate and right
now as we welcome Vice President Biden and


14
0:1:4,49 --> 0:1:7,39
Congressman Paul Ryan. (Applause.)


15
0:1:7,39 --> 0:1:18,85
Very nice to see you. Very nice to see you.


16
0:1:18,85 --> 0:1:26,87
VICE PRESIDENT JOSEPH BIDEN: How you doing?


17
0:1:26,87 --> 0:1:34,33
MS. RADDATZ: Hey, you got your little wave
to the families in. That’s great.


18
0:1:34,33 --> 0:1:38,69
Good evening, gentlemen. It really is an honor
to be here with both of you.


19
0:1:38,69 --> 0:1:44,4
I would like to begin with Libya on a rather
somber note. One month ago tonight, on the


20
0:1:44,4 --> 0:1:50,729
anniversary of 9/11, Ambassador Chris Stevens
and three other brave Americans were killed


21
0:1:50,729 --> 0:1:56,38
in a terrorist attack in Benghazi. The State
Department has now made clear there were no


22
0:1:56,38 --> 0:2:3,56
protesters there. It was a pre-planned assault
by heavily armed men. Wasn’t this a massive


23
0:2:3,56 --> 0:2:5,89
intelligence failure, Vice President Biden?


24
0:2:5,89 --> 0:2:10,649
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: What it was, it was
a tragedy, Martha. It -- Chris Stevens was


25
0:2:10,649 --> 0:2:12,999
one of our best. We lost three other brave
Americans.


26
0:2:12,999 --> 0:2:18,599
And I can make absolutely two commitments
to you and all of the American people tonight:


27
0:2:18,599 --> 0:2:23,669
One, we will find and bring to justice the
men who did this.


28
0:2:23,669 --> 0:2:27,719
And secondly, we will get to the bottom of
it, and whatever -- wherever the facts lead


29
0:2:27,719 --> 0:2:32,819
us, wherever they lead us, w will make clear
to the American public, because whatever mistakes


30
0:2:32,819 --> 0:2:34,549
were made will not be made again.


31
0:2:34,549 --> 0:2:38,889
When you’re looking at a president, Martha,
it seems to me that you should take a look


32
0:2:38,889 --> 0:2:44,59
at his most important responsibility. That’s
carrying forward the national security of


33
0:2:44,59 --> 0:2:47,29
the country. And the best way to do that is
take a look at how he’s handled he issues


34
0:2:47,29 --> 0:2:48,279
of the day.


35
0:2:48,279 --> 0:2:53,519
On Iraq, the president said he would end the
war. Governor Romney said that was a tragic


36
0:2:53,519 --> 0:2:58,189
mistake; we should have left -- that he ended
it -- Governor Romney said that was a tragic


37
0:2:58,189 --> 0:3:0,919
mistake; we should have left 30,000 troops
there.


38
0:3:0,919 --> 0:3:5,859
With regard to Afghanistan, he said he will
end the war in 2014. Governor Romney said


39
0:3:5,859 --> 0:3:11,26
we should not set a date, number one, and
number two, with regard to 2014, it depends.


40
0:3:11,26 --> 0:3:17,219
When it came to Osama bin Laden, the president,
the first day in office -- I was sitting with


41
0:3:17,219 --> 0:3:21,419
him in the Oval Office. He called in the CIA
and signed an order saying, my highest priority


42
0:3:21,419 --> 0:3:23,419
is to get bin Laden.


43
0:3:23,419 --> 0:3:28,209
Prior to the election, prior to the -- him
being sworn in, Governor Romney was asked


44
0:3:28,209 --> 0:3:31,689
a question about how he would proceed. He
said, I wouldn’t move heaven and earth to


45
0:3:31,689 --> 0:3:36,189
get bin Laden. He didn’t understand it was
more than about taking a -- a murderer off


46
0:3:36,189 --> 0:3:41,59
the battlefield; it was about restoring America’s
heart and letting terrorists around the world


47
0:3:41,59 --> 0:3:47,199
know if you do harm to America, we will track
you to the gates of hell, if need be.


48
0:3:47,199 --> 0:3:52,73
And lastly, the -- the president of the United
States has -- has led with a steady hand and


49
0:3:52,73 --> 0:3:59,939
clear vision. Governor Romney, the opposite.
The last thing we need now is another war.


50
0:3:59,939 --> 0:4:2,109
MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan.


51
0:4:2,109 --> 0:4:7,969
REP. RYAN: (Sighs.) We mourn the loss of these
four Americans who were murdered. When you


52
0:4:7,969 --> 0:4:12,659
take a look at what has happened just in the
last few weeks, they sent the U.N. ambassador


53
0:4:12,659 --> 0:4:18,449
out to say that this was because of a protest
and a YouTube video. It took the president


54
0:4:18,449 --> 0:4:24,5
two weeks to acknowledge that this was a terrorist
attack. He went to the U.N., and in his speech


55
0:4:24,5 --> 0:4:28,34
at the U.N. he said six times -- he talked
about the YouTube video.


56
0:4:28,34 --> 0:4:32,52
Look, if we are hit by terrorists, we’re
going to call it for what it is, a terrorist


57
0:4:32,52 --> 0:4:39,34
attack. Our ambassador in Paris has a Marine
detachment guarding him. Shouldn’t we have


58
0:4:39,34 --> 0:4:44,69
a Marine detachment guarding our ambassador
in Benghazi, a place where we knew that there


59
0:4:44,69 --> 0:4:52,92
was an al-Qaida cell with arms? This is becoming
more troubling by the day. They first blamed


60
0:4:52,92 --> 0:4:56,62
the YouTube video; now they’re trying to
blame the Romney-Ryan ticket for making this


61
0:4:56,62 --> 0:4:57,5
an issue.


62
0:4:57,5 --> 0:5:4,23
And with respect to Iraq, we had the same
position before the withdrawal, which was


63
0:5:4,23 --> 0:5:8,54
we agreed with the Obama administration: Let’s
have a Status of Forces Agreement to make


64
0:5:8,54 --> 0:5:13,63
sure that we secure our gains. The vice president
was put in charge of those negotiations by


65
0:5:13,63 --> 0:5:18,29
President Obama, and they failed to get the
agreement. We don’t have a Status of Forces


66
0:5:18,29 --> 0:5:22,0
Agreement because they failed to get one.
That’s what we are talking about.


67
0:5:22,0 --> 0:5:27,29
And when it comes to our veterans, we owe
them a great debt of gratitude for what they’ve


68
0:5:27,29 --> 0:5:33,6
done for us, including your son Beau. But
we also want to make sure that we don’t


69
0:5:33,6 --> 0:5:34,77
lose the things we fought so hard to get.


70
0:5:34,77 --> 0:5:39,96
And with respect to Afghanistan and the 2014
deadline, we agree with a 2014 transition.


71
0:5:39,96 --> 0:5:43,7
But what we also want to do is make sure that
we’re not projecting weakness abroad, and


72
0:5:43,7 --> 0:5:50,24
that’s what’s happening here. This Benghazi
issue would be a tragedy in and of itself.


73
0:5:50,24 --> 0:5:54,17
But unfortunately it’s indicative of a broader
problem, and that is what we are watching


74
0:5:54,17 --> 0:5:59,4
on our TV screens is the unraveling of the
Obama foreign policy, which is making the


75
0:5:59,4 --> 0:6:1,8
world more -- more chaotic and us less safe.


76
0:6:1,8 --> 0:6:6,52
MS. RADDATZ: I just want to talk to you about
right in the middle of the crisis. Governor


77
0:6:6,52 --> 0:6:10,98
Romney -- and you’re talking about this
again tonight -- talked about the weakness,


78
0:6:10,98 --> 0:6:16,61
talked about apologies from the Obama administration.
Was that really appropriate right in the middle


79
0:6:16,61 --> 0:6:17,62
of the crisis?


80
0:6:17,62 --> 0:6:23,25
REP. RYAN: On that same day, the Obama administration
had the exact same position. Let’s recall


81
0:6:23,25 --> 0:6:28,37
that they disavowed their own statement that
they had put out earlier in the day in Cairo.


82
0:6:28,37 --> 0:6:33,55
So we had the same position, but we will -- it’s
never to early to speak out for our values.


83
0:6:33,55 --> 0:6:37,37
We should have spoken out right away when
the Green Revolution was up and starting,


84
0:6:37,37 --> 0:6:42,12
when the mullahs in Iran were attacking their
people. We should not have called Bashar Assad


85
0:6:42,12 --> 0:6:48,17
a reformer when he was turning his Russian-provided
guns on his own people. We should always stand


86
0:6:48,17 --> 0:6:53,889
up for peace, for democracy, for individual
rights, and we should not be imposing these


87
0:6:53,889 --> 0:6:59,45
devastating defense cuts, because what that
does when we equivocate on our values, when


88
0:6:59,45 --> 0:7:0,92
we show that we’re cutting our own defense
--


89
0:7:0,92 --> 0:7:1,45
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Am I going to get to
say anything here?


90
0:7:1,45 --> 0:7:5,3
REP. RYAN: -- it makes us more weak. It projects
weakness, and when we look weak, our adversaries


91
0:7:5,3 --> 0:7:8,639
are much more willing to test us, they’re
more brazen in their attacks, and our allies


92
0:7:8,639 --> 0:7:9,37
are less willing to --


93
0:7:9,37 --> 0:7:12,3
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: With all due respect,
that’s a bunch of malarkey. In fact --


94
0:7:12,3 --> 0:7:13,139
MS. RADDATZ: And why is that so?


95
0:7:13,139 --> 0:7:16,1
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Because not a single
thing he said is accurate. First of all --


96
0:7:16,1 --> 0:7:16,6
MS. RADDATZ: Be specific.


97
0:7:16,6 --> 0:7:21,82
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I will be very specific.
Number one, the -- this lecture on embassy


98
0:7:21,82 --> 0:7:29,53
security -- the congressman here cut embassy
security in his budget by $300 million below


99
0:7:29,53 --> 0:7:33,83
what we asked for, number one. So much for
the embassy security piece.


100
0:7:33,83 --> 0:7:39,15
Number two, Governor Romney, before he knew
the facts, before he even knew that our ambassador


101
0:7:39,15 --> 0:7:44,73
was killed, he was out making a political
statement which was panned by the media around


102
0:7:44,73 --> 0:7:51,169
the world. And this talk about this -- this
weakness, I -- I don’t understand what my


103
0:7:51,169 --> 0:7:52,53
friend’s talking about here.


104
0:7:52,53 --> 0:7:56,61
We -- this is a president who’s gone out
and done everything he has said he was going


105
0:7:56,61 --> 0:8:0,21
to do. This is the guy who’s repaired our
alliances so the rest of the world follows


106
0:8:0,21 --> 0:8:0,96
us again. This is the guy who brought the
entire world, including Russia and China,


107
0:8:0,96 --> 0:8:9,37
to bring about the most devastating, most
devastating -- the most devastating efforts


108
0:8:9,37 --> 0:8:15,11
on Iran to make sure that they in fact stop
with their -- look, I -- I -- I just -- I


109
0:8:15,11 --> 0:8:17,16
mean, these guys bet against America all the
time.


110
0:8:17,16 --> 0:8:17,53
REP. RYAN: I --


111
0:8:17,53 --> 0:8:19,7
MS. RADDATZ: Can we talk about -- let me go
back to Libya.


112
0:8:19,7 --> 0:8:20,45
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Yeah, sure.


113
0:8:20,45 --> 0:8:27,169
MS. RADDATZ: What were you first told about
the attack? Why were people talking about


114
0:8:27,169 --> 0:8:33,959
protests? When people in the consulate first
saw armed men attacking with guns, there were


115
0:8:33,959 --> 0:8:36,459
no protesters. Why did that go on for weeks?


116
0:8:36,459 --> 0:8:37,789
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Because that’s exactly
what we were told --


117
0:8:37,789 --> 0:8:38,559
MS. RADDATZ: By who?


118
0:8:38,559 --> 0:8:41,329
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- by the intelligence
community. The intelligence community told


119
0:8:41,329 --> 0:8:46,449
us that. As they learned more facts about
exactly what happened, they changed their


120
0:8:46,449 --> 0:8:51,79
assessment. That’s why there’s also an
investigation headed by Tom Pickering, a leading


121
0:8:51,79 --> 0:8:55,499
diplomat in the -- from the Reagan years,
who is doing an investigation as to whether


122
0:8:55,499 --> 0:8:59,37
or not there were any lapses, what the lapses
were, so that they will never happen again.


123
0:8:59,37 --> 0:8:59,41
But --


124
0:8:59,41 --> 0:9:0,93
MS. RADDATZ: And they wanted more security
there.


125
0:9:0,93 --> 0:9:4,629
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, we weren’t told
they wanted more security again. We did not


126
0:9:4,629 --> 0:9:10,29
know they wanted more security again. And
by the way, at the time we were told exactly


127
0:9:10,29 --> 0:9:16,49
-- we said exactly what the intelligence community
told us that they knew. That was the assessment.


128
0:9:16,49 --> 0:9:20,149
And as the intelligence community changed
their view, we made it clear they changed


129
0:9:20,149 --> 0:9:23,16
their view. That’s why I said, we will get
to the bottom of this.


130
0:9:23,16 --> 0:9:27,67
You know, usually when there’s a crisis,
we pull together. We pull together as a nation.


131
0:9:27,67 --> 0:9:32,9
But as I said, even before we knew what happened
to the ambassador, the governor was holding


132
0:9:32,9 --> 0:9:36,47
a press conference -- was holding a press
conference. That’s not presidential leadership.


133
0:9:36,47 --> 0:9:41,779
MS. RADDATZ: Mr. Ryan, I want to ask you about
-- the Romney campaign talks a lot about no


134
0:9:41,779 --> 0:9:47,449
apologies. He has a book called “No Apologies.”
Should the U.S. have apologized for Americans


135
0:9:47,449 --> 0:9:53,6
burning Qurans in Afghanistan? Should the
U.S. apologize for U.S. Marines urinating


136
0:9:53,6 --> 0:9:54,839
on Taliban corpses?


137
0:9:54,839 --> 0:10:0,609
REP. RYAN: Oh, gosh, yes. Urinating on Taliban
corpses? What we should not apologize for


138
0:10:0,609 --> 0:10:0,61
--


139
0:10:0,61 --> 0:10:0,769
MS. RADDATZ: Burning Qurans (immediately ?)?


140
0:10:0,769 --> 0:10:5,22
REP. RYAN: What -- what we should not be apologizing
for are standing up for our values. What we


141
0:10:5,22 --> 0:10:11,24
should not be doing is saying to the Egyptian
people, while Mubarak is cracking down on


142
0:10:11,24 --> 0:10:14,99
them, that he’s a good guy and then the
next week say he ought to go. What we should


143
0:10:14,99 --> 0:10:20,879
not be doing is rejecting claims for -- calls
for more security in our barracks, in our


144
0:10:20,879 --> 0:10:26,19
Marine -- we need Marines in Benghazi when
the commander on the ground says we need more


145
0:10:26,19 --> 0:10:27,22
forces for security.


146
0:10:27,22 --> 0:10:30,999
There were requests for extra security. Those
requests were not honored.


147
0:10:30,999 --> 0:10:37,74
Look, this was the anniversary of 9/11. It
was Libya, a country we knew we had al-Qaida


148
0:10:37,74 --> 0:10:43,389
cells there. As we know, al-Qaida and its
affiliates are on the rise in northern Africa.


149
0:10:43,389 --> 0:10:49,499
And we did not give our ambassador in Benghazi
a Marine detachment? Of course there is an


150
0:10:49,499 --> 0:10:53,439
investigation so we can make sure that this
never happens again. But when it comes to


151
0:10:53,439 --> 0:10:56,43
speaking up for our values, we should not
apologize for those.


152
0:10:56,43 --> 0:11:0,769
Here is the problem. Look at all the various
issues out there and that’s unraveling before


153
0:11:0,769 --> 0:11:5,5
our eyes. The vice president talks about sanctions
on Iran. They got -- we’ve had four --


154
0:11:5,5 --> 0:11:9,309
MS. RADDATZ: Let’s move to Iran. I’d actually
like to move to Iran because there is really


155
0:11:9,309 --> 0:11:11,4
no bigger national security --


156
0:11:11,4 --> 0:11:11,379
REP. RYAN: Absolutely.


157
0:11:11,379 --> 0:11:15,11
MS. RADDATZ: -- this country is facing. Both
President Obama and Governor Romney have said


158
0:11:15,11 --> 0:11:21,68
they will prevent Iran from getting a nuclear
weapon, even if that means military action.


159
0:11:21,68 --> 0:11:26,18
Last week former Defense Secretary Bob Gates
said a strike on Iran’s facilities would


160
0:11:26,18 --> 0:11:33,279
not work and, quote, could prove catastrophic,
haunting us for generations. Can the two of


161
0:11:33,279 --> 0:11:40,269
you be absolutely clear and specific to the
American people how effective would a military


162
0:11:40,269 --> 0:11:41,68
strike be? Congressman Ryan.


163
0:11:41,68 --> 0:11:46,49
REP. RYAN: We cannot allow Iran to gain a
nuclear weapons capability.


164
0:11:46,49 --> 0:11:52,399
Now, let’s take a look at where we’ve
gone -- come from. When Barack Obama was elected,


165
0:11:52,399 --> 0:11:56,79
they had enough fissile material, nuclear
material, to make one bomb. Now they have


166
0:11:56,79 --> 0:12:0,389
enough for five. They’re racing toward a
nuclear weapon. They’re four years closer


167
0:12:0,389 --> 0:12:4,499
toward a nuclear weapons capability. We’ve
had four different sanctions at the U.N. on


168
0:12:4,499 --> 0:12:8,749
Iran, three from the Bush administration,
one here. And the only reason we got it is


169
0:12:8,749 --> 0:12:12,999
because Russia watered it down and prevented
the -- the sanctions from hitting the central


170
0:12:12,999 --> 0:12:14,149
bank.


171
0:12:14,149 --> 0:12:17,35
Mitt Romney proposed these sanctions in 2007.
In Congress, I’ve been fighting for these


172
0:12:17,35 --> 0:12:22,23
sanctions since 2009. The administration was
blocking us every step of the way.


173
0:12:22,23 --> 0:12:26,459
Only because we had strong bipartisan support
for these tough sanctions were we able to


174
0:12:26,459 --> 0:12:30,779
overrule their objections and put them in
spite of the administration. Imagine what


175
0:12:30,779 --> 0:12:35,649
would have happened if we had these sanctions
in place earlier. You think Iran’s not brazen?


176
0:12:35,649 --> 0:12:39,869
Look at what they’re doing. They’re stepping
up their terrorist attacks. They tried a terrorist


177
0:12:39,869 --> 0:12:43,509
attack in the United States last year when
they tried to blow up the Saudi ambassador


178
0:12:43,509 --> 0:12:45,939
at a restaurant in Washington, D.C.


179
0:12:45,939 --> 0:12:51,279
And talk about credibility. When this administration
says that all options are on the table, they


180
0:12:51,279 --> 0:12:55,67
send out senior administration officials that
send all these mixed signals.


181
0:12:55,67 --> 0:13:0,749
And so in order solve this peacefully, which
is everybody’s goal, you have to have the


182
0:13:0,749 --> 0:13:5,249
ayatollahs change their minds. Look at where
they are. They’re moving faster toward a


183
0:13:5,249 --> 0:13:9,91
nuclear weapon. It’s because this administration
has no credibility on this issue. It’s because


184
0:13:9,91 --> 0:13:14,66
this administration watered down sanctions,
delayed sanctions, tried to stop us from putting


185
0:13:14,66 --> 0:13:18,579
the tough sanctions in place. Now we have
them in place because of Congress. They say


186
0:13:18,579 --> 0:13:22,16
the military option’s on the table but it’s
not being viewed as credible, and the key


187
0:13:22,16 --> 0:13:28,9
is to do this peacefully, is to make sure
that we have credibility. Under a Romney administration,


188
0:13:28,9 --> 0:13:29,74
we will have credibility on this issue.


189
0:13:29,74 --> 0:13:31,47
MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden.


190
0:13:31,47 --> 0:13:33,97
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Incredible. (Chuckles.)


191
0:13:33,97 --> 0:13:39,889
Look, imagine had we let the Republican Congress
work out the sanctions. You think there’s


192
0:13:39,889 --> 0:13:46,129
any possibility the entire world would have
joined us, Russia and China, all of our allies?


193
0:13:46,129 --> 0:13:52,929
These are the most crippling sanctions in
the history of sanctions, period, period.


194
0:13:52,929 --> 0:13:57,5
When Governor Romney’s asked about it, he
said, we got to keep these sanctions. When


195
0:13:57,5 --> 0:13:59,589
they said, well, you’re talking about doing
more, what are you -- are you -- you’re


196
0:13:59,589 --> 0:14:1,379
going to go to war? Is that you want to do
now?


197
0:14:1,379 --> 0:14:2,29
REP. RYAN: We want to prevent war!


198
0:14:2,29 --> 0:14:4,69
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Inaudible) -- and I
-- the interesting thing is, how they’re


199
0:14:4,69 --> 0:14:7,47
going to prevent war. How are they going to
prevent war if they say that there’s nothing


200
0:14:7,47 --> 0:14:12,149
more that we -- that they say we should do
than what we’ve already done, number one?


201
0:14:12,149 --> 0:14:17,639
And number two, with regard to the ability
of the United States to take action militarily,


202
0:14:17,639 --> 0:14:22,439
it is -- it is not in my purview to talk about
classified information.


203
0:14:22,439 --> 0:14:28,699
But we feel quite confident we could deal
a serious blow to the Iranians. But number


204
0:14:28,699 --> 0:14:34,509
two, the Iranians are -- the Israelis and
the United States -- our military and intelligence


205
0:14:34,509 --> 0:14:40,47
communities are absolutely the same exact
place in terms of how close -- how close the


206
0:14:40,47 --> 0:14:46,6
Iranians are to getting a nuclear weapon.
They are a good way away. There is no difference


207
0:14:46,6 --> 0:14:49,23
between our view and theirs.


208
0:14:49,23 --> 0:14:54,259
When my friend talks about fissile material,
they have to take this highly enriched uranium,


209
0:14:54,259 --> 0:14:59,879
get it from 20 percent up. Then they have
to be able to have something to put it in.


210
0:14:59,879 --> 0:15:5,749
There is no weapon that the Iranians have
at this point. Both the Israelis and we know


211
0:15:5,749 --> 0:15:11,519
we’ll know if they start the process of
building a weapon. So all this bluster I keep


212
0:15:11,519 --> 0:15:16,749
hearing, all this loose talk -- what are they
talking about? Are you talking about to be


213
0:15:16,749 --> 0:15:21,35
more credible? What -- what more can the president
do? Stand before the United Nations, tell


214
0:15:21,35 --> 0:15:27,79
the whole world, directly communicate to the
ayatollah: We will not let them acquire a


215
0:15:27,79 --> 0:15:31,149
nuclear weapon, period, unless he’s talking
about going to war.


216
0:15:31,149 --> 0:15:32,79
REP. RYAN: Martha, let’s just --


217
0:15:32,79 --> 0:15:32,819
MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan.


218
0:15:32,819 --> 0:15:38,119
REP. RYAN: -- let’s look at this from the
view of the ayatollahs. What do they see?


219
0:15:38,119 --> 0:15:43,29
They see this administration trying to water
down sanctions in Congress for over two years.


220
0:15:43,29 --> 0:15:48,199
They’re moving faster toward a nuclear weapon;
they’re spinning the centrifuges faster.


221
0:15:48,199 --> 0:15:52,23
They see us saying, when we come into the
administration, when they’re sworn in, we


222
0:15:52,23 --> 0:15:57,939
need more space with our ally Israel. They
see President Obama in New York City the same


223
0:15:57,939 --> 0:16:2,9
day Bibi Netanyahu is, and he’s -- instead
of meeting with him goes on a -- on a daily


224
0:16:2,9 --> 0:16:8,6
talk show. They see -- when we say that these
options are on the table, the secretary of


225
0:16:8,6 --> 0:16:14,819
defense walked them back. They are not changing
their mind. That’s what we have to do, is


226
0:16:14,819 --> 0:16:16,939
change their mind so they stop pursuing nuclear
weapons, and they’re going faster.


227
0:16:16,939 --> 0:16:22,54
MS. RADDATZ: How will you do it so quickly?
Look, you both saw Benjamin Netanyahu hold


228
0:16:22,54 --> 0:16:29,69
up that picture of a bomb with the red line
and talking about the red line being in spring.


229
0:16:29,69 --> 0:16:35,619
So can you solve this -- if the Romney-Ryan
ticket is elected, can you solve this in two


230
0:16:35,619 --> 0:16:38,89
months before spring and avoid nuclear --


231
0:16:38,89 --> 0:16:41,9
REP. RYAN: We -- we can debate a timeline.


232
0:16:41,9 --> 0:16:41,279
MS. RADDATZ: (Inaudible.)


233
0:16:41,279 --> 0:16:44,589
REP. RYAN: We can debate the timeline, whether
there’s -- it’s that short a time or longer.


234
0:16:44,589 --> 0:16:49,449
I -- I agree that it’s probably longer.
Number two, it’s all about credibility.


235
0:16:49,449 --> 0:16:50,559
MS. RADDATZ: You don’t agree with that bomb
and what the Israelis --


236
0:16:50,559 --> 0:16:51,119
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: No, look -- (inaudible)
--


237
0:16:51,119 --> 0:16:52,69
REP. RYAN: (Inaudible) -- look, we -- we both
-- (inaudible) --


238
0:16:52,69 --> 0:16:52,869
MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden.


239
0:16:52,869 --> 0:16:58,4
REP. RYAN: I don’t want to go into classified
stuff, but we both agree that to do this peacefully,


240
0:16:58,4 --> 0:17:2,59
you’ve got to get them to change their minds.
They’re not changing their minds, and look


241
0:17:2,59 --> 0:17:2,449
at what this administration does --


242
0:17:2,449 --> 0:17:3,49
MS. RADDATZ: But what do you do -- (inaudible)
--


243
0:17:3,49 --> 0:17:4,709
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Let me tell you what
the ayatollah sees.


244
0:17:4,709 --> 0:17:5,47
REP. RYAN: You have to have credibility.


245
0:17:5,47 --> 0:17:10,28
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: The ayatollah sees his
economy being crippled. The ayatollah sees


246
0:17:10,28 --> 0:17:17,16
that there are 50 percent fewer exports of
oil. He sees the currency going into the tank.


247
0:17:17,16 --> 0:17:21,87
He sees the economy going into free fall,
and he sees the world for the first time totally


248
0:17:21,87 --> 0:17:25,28
united in opposition to him getting a nuclear
weapon.


249
0:17:25,28 --> 0:17:29,95
Now, with regard to Bibi, he’s been my friend
for 39 years. The president has met with Bibi


250
0:17:29,95 --> 0:17:35,33
a dozen times. He’s spoken to Bibi Netanyahu
as much as he’s spoken to anybody. The idea


251
0:17:35,33 --> 0:17:39,74
that we’re not -- I was in a -- just before
he went to the U.N., I was in a conference


252
0:17:39,74 --> 0:17:44,61
call with the -- with the president, with
him talking to Bibi, for well over an hour


253
0:17:44,61 --> 0:17:49,64
in -- in -- in -- in -- in stark relief and
detail about what was going on. This is a


254
0:17:49,64 --> 0:17:51,89
bunch of stuff. Look, here’s the deal --


255
0:17:51,89 --> 0:17:53,16
MS. RADDATZ: What does that mean, “a bunch
of stuff”?


256
0:17:53,16 --> 0:17:54,73
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, it means it’s
simply inaccurate.


257
0:17:54,73 --> 0:17:56,6
REP. RYAN: It’s Irish. (Chuckles.)


258
0:17:56,6 --> 0:17:58,79
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: It is. (Laughter.) We
Irish call it malarkey.


259
0:17:58,79 --> 0:17:59,9
MS. RADDATZ: Thanks for the translation. OK.


260
0:17:59,9 --> 0:18:2,81
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: No, we Irish call it
malarkey. (Laughter.) But last thing: the


261
0:18:2,81 --> 0:18:7,58
secretary of defense has made it absolutely
clear. He didn’t walk anything back. We


262
0:18:7,58 --> 0:18:14,93
will not allow the Iranians to get a nuclear
weapon. What Bibi held up there was when they


263
0:18:14,93 --> 0:18:20,67
get to the point where they can enrich uranium
enough to put into a weapon, they don’t


264
0:18:20,67 --> 0:18:22,91
have a weapon to put it into.


265
0:18:22,91 --> 0:18:29,14
Let’s all calm down a little bit here. Iran
is more isolated today than when we took office.


266
0:18:29,14 --> 0:18:32,7
It was on the ascendancy when we took office.
It is totally isolated.


267
0:18:32,7 --> 0:18:33,33
MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan --


268
0:18:33,33 --> 0:18:35,2
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I don’t know what
world you guys are in.


269
0:18:35,2 --> 0:18:35,43
MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan --


270
0:18:35,43 --> 0:18:38,54
REP. RYAN: Thank -- thank heavens we have
these sanctions in place. It’s in spite


271
0:18:38,54 --> 0:18:39,14
of their opposition.


272
0:18:39,14 --> 0:18:39,79
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.) Oh, God.


273
0:18:39,79 --> 0:18:44,86
REP. RYAN: They have given 20 waivers to this
sanction. And all I have to point to are the


274
0:18:44,86 --> 0:18:49,48
results. They’re four years closer toward
a nuclear weapon. I think that case speaks


275
0:18:49,48 --> 0:18:49,75
for itself.


276
0:18:49,75 --> 0:18:50,89
MS. RADDATZ: Can you tell the American people
what’s worse --


277
0:18:50,89 --> 0:18:51,27
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: By the way, they’re
-- no, no, they are not four years closer


278
0:18:51,27 --> 0:18:51,78
to a nuclear weapon.


279
0:18:51,78 --> 0:18:54,26
MS. RADDATZ: -- another war in the Middle
East or --


280
0:18:54,26 --> 0:18:57,81
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: They’re -- they’re
closer to being able to get enough fissile


281
0:18:57,81 --> 0:19:0,59
material to put in a weapon if they had a
weapon. But --


282
0:19:0,59 --> 0:19:2,9
MS. RADDATZ: You’re acting a little bit
like they don’t want one, though.


283
0:19:2,9 --> 0:19:6,6
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Oh, I didn’t say -- no,
I’m not saying -- (look ?), facts matter,


284
0:19:6,6 --> 0:19:11,63
Martha. You’re a foreign policy expert.
Facts matter. All this loose talk about them


285
0:19:11,63 --> 0:19:15,68
-- all they have to do is get to -- enrich
uranium in a certain amount and they have


286
0:19:15,68 --> 0:19:23,14
a weapon -- not true. Not true. They are more
-- and if we ever have to take action, unlike


287
0:19:23,14 --> 0:19:28,74
where we took office, we will have the world
behind us, and that matters. That matters.


288
0:19:28,74 --> 0:19:34,57
MS. RADDATZ: What about Bob Gates’ statement?
Let me read that again: “Could prove catastrophic,


289
0:19:34,57 --> 0:19:36,68
haunting us for generations.”


290
0:19:36,68 --> 0:19:40,46
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: He is right. It could
prove catastrophic if we do -- we do it with


291
0:19:40,46 --> 0:19:40,62
-- (inaudible) --


292
0:19:40,62 --> 0:19:41,28
MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan?


293
0:19:41,28 --> 0:19:45,66
REP. RYAN: And what it does is it -- and it
undermines our credibility by backing up the


294
0:19:45,66 --> 0:19:50,75
point when we make it that all options are
on the table. That’s the point. The ayatollahs


295
0:19:50,75 --> 0:19:55,92
see these kinds of statements, and they think,
I’m going to get a nuclear weapon. When


296
0:19:55,92 --> 0:20:1,75
-- when we see the kind of equivocation that
took place because this administration wanted


297
0:20:1,75 --> 0:20:6,1
a precondition policy -- so when the Green
Revolution started up, they were silent for


298
0:20:6,1 --> 0:20:13,26
nine days. When they see us putting -- when
they see us putting daylight between ourselves


299
0:20:13,26 --> 0:20:18,5
and our allies in Israel, that gives them
encouragement. When they see Russia watering


300
0:20:18,5 --> 0:20:22,57
down any further sanctions -- and the only
reason we got a U.N. sanction is because Russia


301
0:20:22,57 --> 0:20:26,11
watered it down and prevented these -- (there
?) from being sanctions in the first place.


302
0:20:26,11 --> 0:20:30,76
So when they see this kind of activity, they
are encouraged to continue, and that’s the


303
0:20:30,76 --> 0:20:30,98
problem.


304
0:20:30,98 --> 0:20:31,83
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Martha, let me tell
you what Russia’s -- (inaudible) --


305
0:20:31,83 --> 0:20:35,94
MS. RADDATZ: What -- let me ask you what’s
worse: war in the Middle East, another war


306
0:20:35,94 --> 0:20:37,46
in the Middle East, or a nuclear-armed Iran?


307
0:20:37,46 --> 0:20:39,49
REP. RYAN: I’ll tell you what’s worse.
I’ll tell you what’s worse.


308
0:20:39,49 --> 0:20:39,71
MS. RADDATZ: Quickly.


309
0:20:39,71 --> 0:20:44,16
REP. RYAN: A nuclear-armed Iran, which triggers
a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. This


310
0:20:44,16 --> 0:20:47,2
is the world’s largest sponsor of -- of
terrorism. They’ve dedicated themselves


311
0:20:47,2 --> 0:20:47,2
--


312
0:20:47,2 --> 0:20:48,26
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s the only thing
my --


313
0:20:48,26 --> 0:20:51,52
REP. RYAN: -- to wiping an entire country
off the map. They call us the Great Satan.


314
0:20:51,52 --> 0:20:55,82
And if they get nuclear weapons, other people
in the neighborhood will pursue their nuclear


315
0:20:55,82 --> 0:20:56,62
weapons as well.


316
0:20:56,62 --> 0:20:57,49
MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden.


317
0:20:57,49 --> 0:20:58,48
REP. RYAN: We can’t live with that.


318
0:20:58,48 --> 0:21:4,52
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: War should always be
the absolute last resort. That’s why these


319
0:21:4,52 --> 0:21:10,62
crippling sanctions, what Bibi Netanyahu says
we should continue -- which, if I’m not


320
0:21:10,62 --> 0:21:15,71
mistaken, Governor Romney says we -- we should
continue. If I -- I may be mistaken; he changes


321
0:21:15,71 --> 0:21:21,46
his mind so often, I could be wrong. But the
fact of the matter is, he says they’re working.


322
0:21:21,46 --> 0:21:27,56
And the fact is that they are being crippled
by them. And we’ve made it clear, big nations


323
0:21:27,56 --> 0:21:30,23
can’t bluff. This president doesn’t bluff.


324
0:21:30,23 --> 0:21:33,88
MS. RADDATZ: Gentlemen, I want to bring the
conversation to a different kind of national


325
0:21:33,88 --> 0:21:40,81
security issue, the state of our economy.
The number one issue here at home is jobs.


326
0:21:40,81 --> 0:21:47,65
The percentage of unemployed just fell below
8 percent for the first time in 43 months.


327
0:21:47,65 --> 0:21:52,56
The Obama administration had projected that
it would fall below 6 percent now after the


328
0:21:52,56 --> 0:21:57,71
addition of close to a trillion dollars in
stimulus money. So will both of you level


329
0:21:57,71 --> 0:22:3,95
with the American people? Can you get unemployment
to under 6 percent, and how long will it take?


330
0:22:3,95 --> 0:22:5,6
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I don’t know how long
it will take.


331
0:22:5,6 --> 0:22:5,79
MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden.


332
0:22:5,79 --> 0:22:8,16
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: We can and we will get
it under 6 percent.


333
0:22:8,16 --> 0:22:12,49
Let’s look at the -- let’s take a look
at the facts. Let’s look at where we were


334
0:22:12,49 --> 0:22:18,43
when we came to office. The economy was in
free fall. We had -- the Great Recession hit.


335
0:22:18,43 --> 0:22:27,12
Nine million people lost their job, 1.7 -- $1.6
trillion in wealth lost in equity in your


336
0:22:27,12 --> 0:22:29,54
homes, in retirement accounts from the middle
class.


337
0:22:29,54 --> 0:22:33,38
We knew we had to act for the middle class.
We immediately went out and rescued General


338
0:22:33,38 --> 0:22:38,52
Motors. We went ahead and made sure that we
cut taxes for the middle class. And in addition


339
0:22:38,52 --> 0:22:43,5
to that, when that -- and when that occurred,
what did Romney do? Romney said, no, let Detroit


340
0:22:43,5 --> 0:22:48,7
go bankrupt. We moved in and helped people
refinance their homes. Governor Romney said,


341
0:22:48,7 --> 0:22:50,34
no, let foreclosures hit the bottom.


342
0:22:50,34 --> 0:22:54,88
But it shouldn’t be surprising for a guy
who says 47 percent of the American people


343
0:22:54,88 --> 0:22:59,66
are unwilling to take responsibility for their
own lives. My friend recently, in a speech


344
0:22:59,66 --> 0:23:4,84
in Washington, said 30% of the American people
are takers. These people are my mom and dad,


345
0:23:4,84 --> 0:23:9,65
the people I grew up with, my neighbors. They
pay more effective tax than Governor Romney


346
0:23:9,65 --> 0:23:14,18
pays in his federal income tax. They are elderly
people who in fact are living off of Social


347
0:23:14,18 --> 0:23:18,88
Security. They are veterans and people fighting
in Afghanistan right now who are, quote, not


348
0:23:18,88 --> 0:23:19,89
paying any taxes.


349
0:23:19,89 --> 0:23:25,3
I’ve had it up to here with this notion
that 47 percent -- it’s about time they


350
0:23:25,3 --> 0:23:30,11
take some responsibility here. And instead
of signing pledges to Grover Norquist not


351
0:23:30,11 --> 0:23:35,1
to ask the wealthiest among us to contribute
to bring back the middle class, they should


352
0:23:35,1 --> 0:23:38,95
be signing a pledge saying to the middle class,
we’re going to level the playing field.


353
0:23:38,95 --> 0:23:43,97
We’re going to give you a fair shot again.
We are going to not repeat the mistakes we


354
0:23:43,97 --> 0:23:49,37
made in the past by having a different set
of rules for Wall Street and Main Street,


355
0:23:49,37 --> 0:23:53,38
making sure that we continue to hemorrhage
these tax cuts for the superwealthy.


356
0:23:53,38 --> 0:23:59,97
They’re pushing the continuation of a tax
cut that will give an additional $500 billion


357
0:23:59,97 --> 0:24:7,49
in tax cuts to 120,000 families. And they’re
holding hostage the middle-class tax cut because


358
0:24:7,49 --> 0:24:12,42
they say, we won’t pass -- we won’t continue
the middle-class tax cut unless you give the


359
0:24:12,42 --> 0:24:15,44
tax cut for the superwealthy. It’s about
time they take some responsibility.


360
0:24:15,44 --> 0:24:16,9
MS. RADDATZ: Mr. Ryan.


361
0:24:16,9 --> 0:24:19,93
REP. RYAN: Joe and I are from similar towns.


362
0:24:19,93 --> 0:24:24,16
He’s from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I’m
from Janesville, Wisconsin. You know what


363
0:24:24,16 --> 0:24:25,56
the unemployment rate in Scranton is today?


364
0:24:25,56 --> 0:24:26,76
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I sure do.


365
0:24:26,76 --> 0:24:27,42
REP. RYAN: It’s 10 percent.


366
0:24:27,42 --> 0:24:27,95
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Yeah.


367
0:24:27,95 --> 0:24:29,76
REP. RYAN: You know what it was the day you
guys came in?


368
0:24:29,76 --> 0:24:30,4
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: No.


369
0:24:30,4 --> 0:24:31,4
REP. RYAN: Eight-point-five percent.


370
0:24:31,4 --> 0:24:31,68
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Yeah.


371
0:24:31,68 --> 0:24:34,31
REP. RYAN: That’s how it’s going all around
America.


372
0:24:34,31 --> 0:24:34,31
Look --


373
0:24:34,31 --> 0:24:36,66
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: You don’t read the
statistics. That’s not “how it’s going.”


374
0:24:36,66 --> 0:24:37,23
It’s going down.


375
0:24:37,23 --> 0:24:38,1
MS. RADDATZ: (Inaudible) -- two-minute answer,
please.


376
0:24:38,1 --> 0:24:44,2
REP. RYAN: Look -- (chuckles) -- did they
come in and inherit a tough situation? Absolutely.


377
0:24:44,2 --> 0:24:44,98
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.)


378
0:24:44,98 --> 0:24:49,76
REP. RYAN: But we’re going in the wrong
direction! Look at where we are. The economy


379
0:24:49,76 --> 0:24:53,82
is barely limping along. It’s growing at
1.3 percent. That’s slower than it grew


380
0:24:53,82 --> 0:24:58,95
last year, and last year was slower than the
year before. Job growth in September was slower


381
0:24:58,95 --> 0:25:3,9
than it was in August, and August was slower
than it was in July. We’re heading in the


382
0:25:3,9 --> 0:25:4,33
wrong direction.


383
0:25:4,33 --> 0:25:10,65
Twenty-three million Americans are struggling
for work today. Fifteen percent of Americans


384
0:25:10,65 --> 0:25:17,26
are living in poverty today. This is not what
a real recovery looks like. We need real reforms


385
0:25:17,26 --> 0:25:21,24
for a real recovery, and that’s exactly
what Mitt Romney and I are proposing. It’s


386
0:25:21,24 --> 0:25:25,54
five-point plan. Get America energy-independent
in North America by the end of the decade.


387
0:25:25,54 --> 0:25:30,47
Help people who are hurting get the skills
they need to get the jobs they want. Get this


388
0:25:30,47 --> 0:25:33,87
deficit and debt under control to prevent
a debt crisis. Make trade work for America


389
0:25:33,87 --> 0:25:38,42
so we can make more things in America and
sell them overseas and champion small businesses.


390
0:25:38,42 --> 0:25:41,76
Don’t raise taxes on small businesses, because
they’re our job creators.


391
0:25:41,76 --> 0:25:47,39
He talks about Detroit. Mitt Romney’s a
car guy. They keep misquoting him, but let


392
0:25:47,39 --> 0:25:53,0
me tell you about the Mitt Romney I know.
This is a guy who -- I was talking to a family


393
0:25:53,0 --> 0:25:58,47
in Northborough, Massachusetts the other day,
Cheryl and Mark Nixon (sp). Their kids were


394
0:25:58,47 --> 0:26:3,76
hit in a car crash, four of them -- two of
them, Rob (sp) and Reid (sp), were paralyzed.


395
0:26:3,76 --> 0:26:7,11
The Romneys didn’t know them. They went
to the same church. They never met before.


396
0:26:7,11 --> 0:26:13,42
Mitt asked if he could come over on Christmas.
He brought his boys, his wife and gifts. Later


397
0:26:13,42 --> 0:26:17,97
on he said, I know you’re struggling, Mark
(sp). Don’t worry about their college; I’ll


398
0:26:17,97 --> 0:26:19,2
pay for it.


399
0:26:19,2 --> 0:26:21,84
When Mark (sp) told me this story -- because
you know what, Mitt Romney doesn’t tell


400
0:26:21,84 --> 0:26:22,61
these stories.


401
0:26:22,61 --> 0:26:27,9
The Nixons told this story. When he told me
this story, he said it wasn’t the help -- the


402
0:26:27,9 --> 0:26:32,24
cash help; it’s that he gave his time, and
he has consistently. This is a man who gave


403
0:26:32,24 --> 0:26:36,15
30 percent of his income to charity, more
than the two of us combined. Mitt Romney’s


404
0:26:36,15 --> 0:26:41,19
a good man. He cares about a hundred percent
of Americans in this country.


405
0:26:41,19 --> 0:26:46,22
And with respect to that quote, I think the
vice president very well knows that sometimes


406
0:26:46,22 --> 0:26:48,25
the words don’t come out of your mouth the
right way. (Laughter.)


407
0:26:48,25 --> 0:26:53,23
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: But I always say what
I mean.


408
0:26:53,23 --> 0:26:53,83
MS. RADDATZ: You --


409
0:26:53,83 --> 0:26:55,23
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: And so does Romney.


410
0:26:55,23 --> 0:26:59,61
REP. RYAN: We want everybody to succeed. We
want to get people out of poverty, in the


411
0:26:59,61 --> 0:27:3,53
middle class, on to lives of self-sufficiency.
We believe in opportunity and upward mobility.


412
0:27:3,53 --> 0:27:5,58
That’s what we’re going to push for in
a Romney administration.


413
0:27:5,58 --> 0:27:6,18
MS. RADDATZ: Vice President?


414
0:27:6,18 --> 0:27:7,6
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Look --


415
0:27:7,6 --> 0:27:9,91
MS. RADDATZ: I have a feeling you have a few
things to say here. (Laughter.)


416
0:27:9,91 --> 0:27:14,75
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.) The idea,
if you heard that -- that little soliloquy


417
0:27:14,75 --> 0:27:21,59
on 47 percent, and you think he just made
a mistake, then I think you’re -- I -- I


418
0:27:21,59 --> 0:27:26,45
-- I -- I -- I got a bridge to sell you.


419
0:27:26,45 --> 0:27:30,46
Look, I don’t doubt his personal generosity,
and I understand what it’s like. When I


420
0:27:30,46 --> 0:27:35,89
was a little younger than the congressman,
my wife was in an accident, killed my daughter


421
0:27:35,89 --> 0:27:42,6
and my wife, and my two sons survived. I have
sat in the homes of many people who’ve gone


422
0:27:42,6 --> 0:27:46,9
through what I get through because the one
thing you can give people solace is to know


423
0:27:46,9 --> 0:27:53,63
they know you’ve been through it, that they
can make it. So I don’t doubt his personal


424
0:27:53,63 --> 0:27:54,89
commitment to individuals.


425
0:27:54,89 --> 0:28:0,46
But you know what, I know he had no commitment
to the automobile industry. He just let -- he


426
0:28:0,46 --> 0:28:6,9
said, let it go bankrupt, period, let it drop
out. All this talk -- we saved a million jobs.


427
0:28:6,9 --> 0:28:10,67
Two hundred thousand people are working today.
And I have never met two guys who are more


428
0:28:10,67 --> 0:28:16,8
down on America across the board. We’re
told everything is going bad. We have 5.2


429
0:28:16,8 --> 0:28:20,88
million new jobs, private sector jobs. We
need more, but 5.2 million -- if they’d


430
0:28:20,88 --> 0:28:25,16
get out of the way, if they get out of the
way and let us pass the tax cut for the middle


431
0:28:25,16 --> 0:28:29,87
class, make it permanent, if they get out
of the way and pass the -- pass the jobs bill,


432
0:28:29,87 --> 0:28:34,5
if they get out of the way and let us allow
14 million people who are struggling to stay


433
0:28:34,5 --> 0:28:37,66
in their homes because their mortgages are
upside-down, but they never missed a mortgage


434
0:28:37,66 --> 0:28:40,3
payment -- just get out of the way.


435
0:28:40,3 --> 0:28:45,96
Stop talking about how you care about people.
Show me something. Show me a policy. Show


436
0:28:45,96 --> 0:28:49,32
me a policy where you take responsibility.


437
0:28:49,32 --> 0:28:53,12
And by the way, they talk about this Great
Recession if it fell out of the sky, like,


438
0:28:53,12 --> 0:28:58,87
oh my goodness, where did it come from? It
came from this man voting to put two wars


439
0:28:58,87 --> 0:29:3,81
in a credit card, to at the same time put
a prescription drug benefit on the credit


440
0:29:3,81 --> 0:29:8,97
card, a trillion- dollar tax cut for a -- very
wealthy. I was there. I voted against him.


441
0:29:8,97 --> 0:29:14,6
I said, no, we can’t afford that. And now
all of a sudden these guys are so seized with


442
0:29:14,6 --> 0:29:17,38
a concern about the debt that they created
--


443
0:29:17,38 --> 0:29:18,99
MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan.


444
0:29:18,99 --> 0:29:25,19
REP. RYAN: Let’s not forget that they came
in with one-party control. When Barack Obama


445
0:29:25,19 --> 0:29:29,2
was elected, his party controlled everything.
They had the ability to do everything of their


446
0:29:29,2 --> 0:29:34,48
choosing, and look at where we are right now.
They passed a stimulus, the idea that we could


447
0:29:34,48 --> 0:29:38,65
borrow $831 billion, spend it on all these
special interest groups and that it would


448
0:29:38,65 --> 0:29:43,2
work out just fine, that unemployment would
never get to 8 percent. It went up above 8


449
0:29:43,2 --> 0:29:47,34
percent for 43 months. They said that right
now, if we just pass this stimulus, the economy


450
0:29:47,34 --> 0:29:49,8
would grow at 4 percent. It’s growing at
1.3 (percent).


451
0:29:49,8 --> 0:29:52,4
MS. RADDATZ: When could you get it below 6
percent?


452
0:29:52,4 --> 0:29:55,85
REP. RYAN: That’s what our entire premise
of our pro-growth plan for a stronger middle


453
0:29:55,85 --> 0:30:0,6
class is all about: getting the economy growing
at 4 percent, creating 12 million jobs over


454
0:30:0,6 --> 0:30:5,47
the next four years. Look at just the $90
billion in stimulus, and -- and the vice president


455
0:30:5,47 --> 0:30:10,65
was in charge of overseeing this, $90 billion
in green pork to campaign contributors and


456
0:30:10,65 --> 0:30:15,91
special interest groups. There are just at
the Department of Energy over 100 criminal


457
0:30:15,91 --> 0:30:17,94
investigations that have been launched into
just how --


458
0:30:17,94 --> 0:30:18,52
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Martha --


459
0:30:18,52 --> 0:30:19,54
REP. RYAN: -- stimulus -- (inaudible) -- are
being spent --


460
0:30:19,54 --> 0:30:20,12
MS. RADDATZ: Go ahead.


461
0:30:20,12 --> 0:30:20,56
Go ahead, Vice --


462
0:30:20,56 --> 0:30:23,72
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Martha, look. His colleague
runs an investigative committee --


463
0:30:23,72 --> 0:30:24,23
REP. RYAN: Crony capitalism -- (inaudible).


464
0:30:24,23 --> 0:30:26,53
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- spent months and
months and months going into this --


465
0:30:26,53 --> 0:30:27,61
REP. RYAN: This is the -- this is the inspector
general.


466
0:30:27,61 --> 0:30:32,16
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- months and months.
They found no evidence of cronyism. And I


467
0:30:32,16 --> 0:30:37,12
love my friend here. I -- I’m not allowed
to show letters, but go on our website: He


468
0:30:37,12 --> 0:30:42,83
sent me two letters saying, by the way, can
you send me some stimulus money for companies


469
0:30:42,83 --> 0:30:47,82
here in the state of Wisconsin? We sent millions
of dollars. You know why he said he needed


470
0:30:47,82 --> 0:30:47,82
--


471
0:30:47,82 --> 0:30:48,94
MS. RADDATZ: You did ask for stimulus money,
correct?


472
0:30:48,94 --> 0:30:50,1
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Sure he did. By the
way -- (inaudible) --


473
0:30:50,1 --> 0:30:53,55
REP. RYAN: On two occasions, we -- we -- we
advocated for constituents who were applying


474
0:30:53,55 --> 0:30:54,4
for grants.


475
0:30:54,4 --> 0:30:54,39
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.)


476
0:30:54,39 --> 0:30:57,2
REP. RYAN: That’s what we do. We do that
for all constituents who are -- (inaudible)


477
0:30:57,2 --> 0:30:57,2
-- for grants.


478
0:30:57,2 --> 0:31:0,7
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I love that. I love
that. This is such a bad program, and he writes


479
0:31:0,7 --> 0:31:4,7
me a letter saying -- writes the Department
of Energy a letter saying, the reason we need


480
0:31:4,7 --> 0:31:10,61
this stimulus -- it will create growth and
jobs. He -- his words. And now he’s sitting


481
0:31:10,61 --> 0:31:15,16
here looking at me -- and by the way, that
program -- again, investigated -- what the


482
0:31:15,16 --> 0:31:22,8
Congress said was, it was a model: less than
four-tenths of 1 percent waste or fraud in


483
0:31:22,8 --> 0:31:27,19
the program. And all this talk about cronyism
-- they investigated, investigated; did not


484
0:31:27,19 --> 0:31:32,19
find one single piece of evidence. I wish
he would just tell -- be a little more candid.


485
0:31:32,19 --> 0:31:38,309
REP. RYAN: Was it a good idea to spend taxpayer
dollars on electric cars in Finland or on


486
0:31:38,309 --> 0:31:39,16
windmills in China?


487
0:31:39,16 --> 0:31:39,8
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Look --


488
0:31:39,8 --> 0:31:43,1
REP. RYAN: Was it a good idea to borrow all
this money from countries like China --


489
0:31:43,1 --> 0:31:43,61
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.)


490
0:31:43,61 --> 0:31:46,26
REP. RYAN: -- and spend it on all these various
different interest groups?


491
0:31:46,26 --> 0:31:48,54
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Let me tell you it was
a good idea. It was a good idea -- Moody’s


492
0:31:48,54 --> 0:31:52,35
and others said that this was exactly what
we needed that stopped us from going off the


493
0:31:52,35 --> 0:31:57,43
cliff. It set the conditions to be able to
grow again. We have -- in fact, 4 percent


494
0:31:57,43 --> 0:32:1,67
of those green jobs didn’t go under -- or
went -- went -- went under -- didn’t work.


495
0:32:1,67 --> 0:32:5,38
It’s a better batting average than investment
bankers have. They have about a 40 percent


496
0:32:5,38 --> 0:32:5,78
-- (inaudible) -- loss.


497
0:32:5,78 --> 0:32:8,2
REP. RYAN: Where are the 5 million green jobs
that were being promised --


498
0:32:8,2 --> 0:32:12,33
MS. RADDATZ: I want to move on here to Medicare
and entitlements. I think we’ve gone over


499
0:32:12,33 --> 0:32:13,44
this quite enough. And both --


500
0:32:13,44 --> 0:32:15,85
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: And by the way, any
letter you send me I’ll entertain.


501
0:32:15,85 --> 0:32:18,21
REP. RYAN: I appreciate that, Joe. (Laughter.)


502
0:32:18,21 --> 0:32:21,809
MS. RADDATZ: Let’s talk about Medicare and
entitlements.


503
0:32:21,809 --> 0:32:26,32
Both Medicare and Social Security are going
broke and taking a larger share of the budget


504
0:32:26,32 --> 0:32:32,39
in the process. Will benefits for Americans
under these programs have to change for the


505
0:32:32,39 --> 0:32:34,809
programs to survive, Mr. Ryan?


506
0:32:34,809 --> 0:32:38,39
REP. RYAN: Absolutely. Medicare and Social
Security are going bankrupt. These are indisputable


507
0:32:38,39 --> 0:32:39,3
facts.


508
0:32:39,3 --> 0:32:44,25
Look, when I look at these programs, we’ve
all had tragedies in our lives. I think about


509
0:32:44,25 --> 0:32:49,59
what they’ve done for my own family. My
mom and I had my grandmother move in with


510
0:32:49,59 --> 0:32:52,59
us who was facing Alzheimer’s. Medicare
was there for her, just like it’s there


511
0:32:52,59 --> 0:32:57,0
for my mom right now who’s a Florida senior.
After my dad died, my mom and I got Social


512
0:32:57,0 --> 0:33:0,59
Security survivors benefits. Helped me pay
for college. It helped her go back to college


513
0:33:0,59 --> 0:33:6,18
in her 50s, where she started a small business
because of the new skills she got. She paid


514
0:33:6,18 --> 0:33:11,45
all of her taxes on the promise that these
programs would be there for her. We will honor


515
0:33:11,45 --> 0:33:12,9
this promise.


516
0:33:12,9 --> 0:33:17,24
And the best way to do it is reform it for
my generation. You see, if you reform these


517
0:33:17,24 --> 0:33:22,12
programs for my generation, people 54 and
below, you can guarantee they don’t change


518
0:33:22,12 --> 0:33:26,55
for people in or near retirement, which is
precisely what Mitt Romney and I are proposing.


519
0:33:26,55 --> 0:33:32,8
Look at what -- look what “Obamacare”
does. “Obamacare” takes $716 billion from


520
0:33:32,8 --> 0:33:37,7
Medicare to spend on “Obamacare.” Even
their own chief actuary at Medicare backs


521
0:33:37,7 --> 0:33:40,93
this up. He says you can’t spend the same
dollar twice. You can’t claim that this


522
0:33:40,93 --> 0:33:44,33
money goes to Medicare and “Obamacare.”


523
0:33:44,33 --> 0:33:48,3
And then they put this new “Obamacare”
board in charge of cutting Medicare each and


524
0:33:48,3 --> 0:33:52,96
every year in ways that will lead to denied
care for current seniors. This board, by the


525
0:33:52,96 --> 0:33:57,15
way, it’s 15 people. The president’s supposed
to appoint them next year. And not one of


526
0:33:57,15 --> 0:33:58,75
them even has to have medical training.


527
0:33:58,75 --> 0:34:3,67
And Social Security, if we don’t shore up
Social Security, when we run out of the IOUs,


528
0:34:3,67 --> 0:34:8,77
when the program goes bankrupt, a 25 percent
across-the-board benefit cut kicks in on current


529
0:34:8,77 --> 0:34:13,7
seniors in the middle of their retirement.
We’re going to stop that from happening.


530
0:34:13,7 --> 0:34:17,86
They haven’t put a credible solution on
the table. He’ll tell you about vouchers.


531
0:34:17,86 --> 0:34:20,85
He’ll say all these things to try and scare
people.


532
0:34:20,85 --> 0:34:24,75
Here’s what we’re saying: Give younger
people, when they become Medicare-eligible,


533
0:34:24,75 --> 0:34:30,86
guaranteed coverage options that you can’t
be denied, including traditional Medicare.


534
0:34:30,86 --> 0:34:34,76
Choose your plan, and then Medicare subsidizes
your premiums, not as much for the wealthy


535
0:34:34,76 --> 0:34:39,679
people, more coverage for middle-income people
and total out-of-pocket coverage for the poor


536
0:34:39,679 --> 0:34:44,6
and the sick. Choice and competition -- we
would rather have 50 million future seniors


537
0:34:44,6 --> 0:34:48,35
determine how their Medicare is delivered
to them instead of 15 bureaucrats deciding


538
0:34:48,35 --> 0:34:50,2
what -- if, where, when they get it.


539
0:34:50,2 --> 0:34:51,35
MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden, two minutes.


540
0:34:51,35 --> 0:34:54,19
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: You know, I heard that
death panel argument from Sarah Palin. It


541
0:34:54,19 --> 0:34:58,45
seems that every vice presidential debate,
I hear this kind of stuff about panels. But


542
0:34:58,45 --> 0:35:0,74
let’s talk about Medicare.


543
0:35:0,74 --> 0:35:7,69
What we did is we saved $716 billion and put
it back -- applied it to Medicare. We cut


544
0:35:7,69 --> 0:35:13,54
the cost of Medicare. We stopped overpaying
insurance companies when doctors and hospitals


545
0:35:13,54 --> 0:35:20,49
-- the AMA supported what we did. AARP endorsed
what we did. And it extends the life of Medicare


546
0:35:20,49 --> 0:35:27,9
to 2024. They want to wipe this all out. It
also gave more benefits. Any senior out there,


547
0:35:27,9 --> 0:35:31,59
ask yourself: Do you have more benefits today?
You do. If you’re near the doughnut hole,


548
0:35:31,59 --> 0:35:36,9
you have $600 more to help your prescription
drug costs. You get wellness visits without


549
0:35:36,9 --> 0:35:42,71
copays. They wipe all of this out, and Medicare
goes -- becomes insolvent in 2016, number


550
0:35:42,71 --> 0:35:43,52
one.


551
0:35:43,52 --> 0:35:48,47
Number two, guaranteed benefit -- it’s a
voucher. When they first proposed -- when


552
0:35:48,47 --> 0:35:56,73
the congressman had his first voucher program,
the CBO said it would cost $6,400 a year,


553
0:35:56,73 --> 0:36:3,47
Martha, more for every senior 55 and below
when they got there. He knew that, yet he


554
0:36:3,47 --> 0:36:8,3
got it -- all the guys in Congress, and women
in the Republican party to vote for it. Governor


555
0:36:8,3 --> 0:36:14,88
Romney, knowing that, said, I -- I -- I would
sign it were I there. Who you believe, the


556
0:36:14,88 --> 0:36:20,5
AMA? Me? A guy who’s fought his whole life
for this? Or somebody who had actually put


557
0:36:20,5 --> 0:36:28,5
in motion a plan that knowingly cut -- added
$6,400 a year more to the cost of Medicare?


558
0:36:28,5 --> 0:36:33,23
Now they got a new plan. Trust me, it’s
not going to cost you any more. Folks, follow


559
0:36:33,23 --> 0:36:35,3
your instincts on this one.


560
0:36:35,3 --> 0:36:40,31
And with regard to Social Security, we will
not -- we will not privatize it. If we had


561
0:36:40,31 --> 0:36:45,98
listened to Romney, to Governor Romney and
the congressman during the Bush years, imagine


562
0:36:45,98 --> 0:36:51,23
where all those seniors would be now if their
money had been in the market. Their ideas


563
0:36:51,23 --> 0:36:55,96
are old, and their ideas are bad, and they
eliminate the guarantee of Medicare.


564
0:36:55,96 --> 0:37:0,85
REP. RYAN: Here’s the problem. They got
caught with their hands in the cookie jar


565
0:37:0,85 --> 0:37:6,25
turning Medicare into a piggy bank for “Obamacare”.
Their own actuary from the administration


566
0:37:6,25 --> 0:37:11,26
came to Congress and said one out of six hospitals
and nursing homes are going to go out of business


567
0:37:11,26 --> 0:37:12,5
as a result of this.


568
0:37:12,5 --> 0:37:12,94
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s not what they
said.


569
0:37:12,94 --> 0:37:16,73
REP. RYAN: Seven point four million seniors
are projected to lose the current Medicare


570
0:37:16,73 --> 0:37:19,8
Advantage coverage they have. That’s a $3,200
benefit cut.


571
0:37:19,8 --> 0:37:20,65
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That didn’t happen.


572
0:37:20,65 --> 0:37:21,15
REP. RYAN: What we’re saying --


573
0:37:21,15 --> 0:37:22,6
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: More people signed up.


574
0:37:22,6 --> 0:37:23,14
REP. RYAN: These are from your own actuaries.


575
0:37:23,14 --> 0:37:26,369
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: More -- more -- more
people signed up for Medicare Advantage after


576
0:37:26,369 --> 0:37:26,99
the change.


577
0:37:26,99 --> 0:37:27,28
REP. RYAN: What -- what they’re --


578
0:37:27,28 --> 0:37:28,79
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: No -- nobody is getting
shut down.


579
0:37:28,79 --> 0:37:28,79
REP. RYAN: Mr. Vice President, I know --


580
0:37:28,79 --> 0:37:29,89
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: No -- no -- (inaudible)
--


581
0:37:29,89 --> 0:37:33,73
REP. RYAN: Mr. Vice President, I know you’re
under a lot of duress -- (laughter) -- to


582
0:37:33,73 --> 0:37:37,44
make up for lost ground -- (laughter) -- but
I think people would be better served if we


583
0:37:37,44 --> 0:37:38,57
don’t keep interrupting each other.


584
0:37:38,57 --> 0:37:40,3
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, don’t take all
the four minutes, then.


585
0:37:40,3 --> 0:37:43,3
REP. RYAN: Now let me just -- let me say this.
We are not -- we are saying, don’t change


586
0:37:43,3 --> 0:37:47,29
benefits for people 55 and above. They already
organized their retirement around these promises.


587
0:37:47,29 --> 0:37:47,43
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: They already are --


588
0:37:47,43 --> 0:37:47,95
REP. RYAN: But you want to -- (inaudible)
-- these programs for those of us --


589
0:37:47,95 --> 0:37:53,54
MS. RADDATZ: Let me ask you this: what is
your specific plan for seniors who really


590
0:37:53,54 --> 0:37:58,56
can’t afford to make up the difference in
the value of what you call a premium support


591
0:37:58,56 --> 0:38:0,1
plan and others call a voucher?


592
0:38:0,1 --> 0:38:1,47
REP. RYAN: A hundred percent coverage for
them.


593
0:38:1,47 --> 0:38:1,47
MS. RADDATZ: And what --


594
0:38:1,47 --> 0:38:2,619
REP. RYAN: That’s what we’re saying.


595
0:38:2,619 --> 0:38:3,18
MS. RADDATZ: -- what cost --


596
0:38:3,18 --> 0:38:4,619
REP. RYAN: So we’re saying income-adjust
--


597
0:38:4,619 --> 0:38:5,5
MS. RADDATZ: How do you make that up?


598
0:38:5,5 --> 0:38:9,61
REP. RYAN: -- these premium support payments
by taking down the subsidies for wealthy people.


599
0:38:9,61 --> 0:38:14,76
Look, this is a plan -- by the way, that $6,400
number, it was misleading then. It’s totally


600
0:38:14,76 --> 0:38:20,36
inaccurate now. This is a plan that’s bipartisan.
It’s a plan I put together with a prominent


601
0:38:20,36 --> 0:38:21,49
Democrat senator from Oregon.


602
0:38:21,49 --> 0:38:23,24
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: There’s not one Democrat
who endorsed his --


603
0:38:23,24 --> 0:38:23,5
REP. RYAN: It’s a plan --


604
0:38:23,5 --> 0:38:25,49
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- not one Democrat
who signed his plan.


605
0:38:25,49 --> 0:38:27,29
REP. RYAN: Our partner is a Democrat from
Oregon.


606
0:38:27,29 --> 0:38:29,77
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: And he said he does
no longer support (you for that ?).


607
0:38:29,77 --> 0:38:31,89
REP. RYAN: We -- we put it -- we put it together
with the former Clinton budget director.


608
0:38:31,89 --> 0:38:32,45
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Who disavows it. (Chuckles.)


609
0:38:32,45 --> 0:38:38,27
REP. RYAN: This idea -- this idea came from
the Clinton commission to save Medicare, chaired


610
0:38:38,27 --> 0:38:40,35
by Senator John Breaux. Here’s the point,
Martha.


611
0:38:40,35 --> 0:38:41,79
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Which was rejected.


612
0:38:41,79 --> 0:38:45,9
REP. RYAN: If we don’t -- if we don’t
fix this problem pretty soon, then current


613
0:38:45,9 --> 0:38:49,6
seniors get cut! Here’s the problem. Ten
thousand people are retiring every single


614
0:38:49,6 --> 0:38:53,44
day in America today, and they will for 20
years. That’s not a political thing. That’s


615
0:38:53,44 --> 0:38:53,66
a math thing.


616
0:38:53,66 --> 0:38:57,89
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Martha, if we just did
one thing, if we just -- if they allow Medicare


617
0:38:57,89 --> 0:39:5,26
to bargain for the cost of drugs like Medicaid
can, that would save $156 billion right off


618
0:39:5,26 --> 0:39:5,47
the bat.


619
0:39:5,47 --> 0:39:6,23
REP. RYAN: And it would deny seniors choices.


620
0:39:6,23 --> 0:39:7,47
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: All -- all -- all --


621
0:39:7,47 --> 0:39:9,48
REP. RYAN: It -- it has restricted (formula
?) --


622
0:39:9,48 --> 0:39:10,0
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Seniors are not denied.


623
0:39:10,0 --> 0:39:10,46
REP. RYAN: Absolutely.


624
0:39:10,46 --> 0:39:12,28
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Sorry, they are not
denied.


625
0:39:12,28 --> 0:39:17,72
Look, folks, and all you seniors out there,
have you been denied choices? Have you lost


626
0:39:17,72 --> 0:39:18,93
Medicare Advantage or, if you have signed
up --


627
0:39:18,93 --> 0:39:19,45
REP. RYAN: Because it’s working well right
now.


628
0:39:19,45 --> 0:39:20,29
VICE RESIDENT BIDEN: Because we changed the
law!


629
0:39:20,29 --> 0:39:25,4
MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden, let me
ask you, if it could help solve the problem,


630
0:39:25,4 --> 0:39:31,34
why not very slowly raise the Medicare eligibility
age by two years, as Congressman Ryan suggests?


631
0:39:31,34 --> 0:39:35,81
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Look, I was there when
we did that with Social Security, in 1983.


632
0:39:35,81 --> 0:39:40,9
I was one of eight people sitting in the room
that included Tip O’Neill negotiating with


633
0:39:40,9 --> 0:39:44,94
President Reagan. We all got together, and
everybody said, as long as everybody’s in


634
0:39:44,94 --> 0:39:50,66
the deal, everybody’s in the deal, and everybody
is making some sacrifice, we can find a way.


635
0:39:50,66 --> 0:39:55,0
We made the system solvent to 2033.


636
0:39:55,0 --> 0:40:1,619
We will not, though, be part of any voucher
plan eliminating -- the voucher says, Mom,


637
0:40:1,619 --> 0:40:6,19
when you’re -- when you’re 65, go out
there, shop for the best insurance you can


638
0:40:6,19 --> 0:40:10,33
get; you’re out of Medicare. You can buy
back in, if you want, with this voucher, which


639
0:40:10,33 --> 0:40:14,88
will not keep pace -- will not keep pace with
health care costs, because if it did keep


640
0:40:14,88 --> 0:40:19,859
pace with health care costs, there would be
no savings. That’s why they go the voucher


641
0:40:19,859 --> 0:40:26,71
-- they -- we will be no part of a voucher
program or the privatization of Social Security.


642
0:40:26,71 --> 0:40:30,67
REP. RYAN: A voucher is you go to your mailbox,
get a check and buy something. Nobody’s


643
0:40:30,67 --> 0:40:36,49
proposing that. Barack Obama, four years ago,
running for president, said if you don’t


644
0:40:36,49 --> 0:40:42,7
have any fresh ideas, use stale tactics to
scare voters. If you don’t have a good record


645
0:40:42,7 --> 0:40:46,14
to run on, paint your opponent as someone
people should run from. Make a big election


646
0:40:46,14 --> 0:40:46,78
about small ideas.


647
0:40:46,78 --> 0:40:51,2
MS. RADDATZ: You were one of the few lawmakers
to stand with President Bush when he was seeking


648
0:40:51,2 --> 0:40:52,69
to partially privatize Social Security.


649
0:40:52,69 --> 0:40:57,109
REP. RYAN: For younger people. What we said
then and what I’ve always agreed is let


650
0:40:57,109 --> 0:41:2,47
younger Americans have a voluntary choice
of making their money work faster for them


651
0:41:2,47 --> 0:41:3,619
within the Social Security system.


652
0:41:3,619 --> 0:41:5,119
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: You saw how well that
worked.


653
0:41:5,119 --> 0:41:7,78
REP. RYAN: That’s not what Mitt Romney’s
proposing. What we’re saying is no changes


654
0:41:7,78 --> 0:41:8,82
for anybody 55 and above.


655
0:41:8,82 --> 0:41:10,6
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: What Mitt Romney is
proposing --


656
0:41:10,6 --> 0:41:13,17
REP. RYAN: And then the kinds of the changes
we’re talking about for younger people like


657
0:41:13,17 --> 0:41:17,58
myself is don’t increase the benefits for
wealthy people as fast as everybody else --


658
0:41:17,58 --> 0:41:18,8
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Martha --


659
0:41:18,8 --> 0:41:20,27
REP. RYAN: -- slowly raise the retirement
age over time.


660
0:41:20,27 --> 0:41:20,6
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Martha --


661
0:41:20,6 --> 0:41:25,26
REP. RYAN: It wouldn’t get to the age of
70 until the year 2103, according to the actuaries.


662
0:41:25,26 --> 0:41:26,7
Now, here’s the issue.


663
0:41:26,7 --> 0:41:27,3
MS. RADDATZ: Quickly, Vice President.


664
0:41:27,3 --> 0:41:30,45
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Quickly, the bottom
line here is that all the studies show that


665
0:41:30,45 --> 0:41:35,17
if we went with Social Security proposal made
by Mitt Romney, if you’re 40 -- in your


666
0:41:35,17 --> 0:41:41,31
40s now, you will pay $2,600 a year -- you
get $2,600 a year less in Social Security.


667
0:41:41,31 --> 0:41:47,31
If you’re in your 20s now, you get $4,700
a year less. The idea of changing -- and change


668
0:41:47,31 --> 0:41:52,27
being, in this case, to cut the benefits for
people without taking other action you could


669
0:41:52,27 --> 0:41:55,34
do to make it work -- is absolutely the wrong
way.


670
0:41:55,34 --> 0:42:0,34
These -- look, these guys haven’t been big
on Medicare from the beginning. Their party’s


671
0:42:0,34 --> 0:42:4,33
not been big on Medicare from the beginning.
And they’ve always been about Social Security


672
0:42:4,33 --> 0:42:9,94
as little as you can do. Look, folks, use
your common sense. Who do you trust on this?


673
0:42:9,94 --> 0:42:17,5
A man who introduced a bill that would raise
it $6,400 a year, knowing it and passing it,


674
0:42:17,5 --> 0:42:20,34
and Romney saying he’d sign it? Or me and
the president?


675
0:42:20,34 --> 0:42:23,5
REP. RYAN: That statistic was completely misleading.
But more importantly --


676
0:42:23,5 --> 0:42:24,51
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s -- there are
the facts, right?


677
0:42:24,51 --> 0:42:27,0
REP. RYAN: -- this is -- this is what politicians
do when they don’t have a record to run


678
0:42:27,0 --> 0:42:33,13
on: try to scare people from voting for you.
If you don’t get ahead of this problem,


679
0:42:33,13 --> 0:42:33,9
it’s going to -- (inaudible) --


680
0:42:33,9 --> 0:42:36,6
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Medicare beneficiaries
have more benefits now -- (inaudible) --


681
0:42:36,6 --> 0:42:36,84
REP. RYAN: We are not going to run away -- we
are not going to run away --


682
0:42:36,84 --> 0:42:38,9
MS. RADDATZ: OK. We’re going to -- we’re
going to move on to a very simple question


683
0:42:38,9 --> 0:42:39,1
to you both.


684
0:42:39,1 --> 0:42:42,89
REP. RYAN: Medicare and Social Security did
so much for my own family. We are not going


685
0:42:42,89 --> 0:42:45,619
to jeopardize this program, but we have to
save it for the next generation so it doesn’t


686
0:42:45,619 --> 0:42:45,71
go bankrupt.


687
0:42:45,71 --> 0:42:48,95
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: You are jeopardizing
the program. You’re changing the program


688
0:42:48,95 --> 0:42:53,7
from a guaranteed benefit to a premium support.
Whatever you call it, the bottom line is people


689
0:42:53,7 --> 0:42:55,17
are going to have to pay more money out of
their pocket.


690
0:42:55,17 --> 0:42:55,57
REP. RYAN: The wealthy would.


691
0:42:55,57 --> 0:42:58,56
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: And the families I know
and the families I come from -- they don’t


692
0:42:58,56 --> 0:43:0,72
have the money to pay more out of -- (inaudible).


693
0:43:0,72 --> 0:43:1,7
MS. RADDATZ: Gentlemen, gentlemen --


694
0:43:1,7 --> 0:43:3,56
REP. RYAN: That’s why we’re saying more
for lower-income people and less for higher-income


695
0:43:3,56 --> 0:43:3,67
people.


696
0:43:3,67 --> 0:43:7,28
MS. RADDATZ: I would like to move on to a
very simple question for both of you. And


697
0:43:7,28 --> 0:43:8,119
something tells me --


698
0:43:8,119 --> 0:43:8,77
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.)


699
0:43:8,77 --> 0:43:12,25
MS. RADDATZ: -- I won’t get a very simple
answer. But let me ask you this.


700
0:43:12,25 --> 0:43:14,76
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I gave you a simple
answer: He’s raising the cost of Medicare.


701
0:43:14,76 --> 0:43:20,78
MS. RADDATZ: OK, on to taxes. If your ticket
is elected, who will pay more in taxes? Who


702
0:43:20,78 --> 0:43:23,7
will pay less? And we’re starting with Vice
President Biden for two minutes.


703
0:43:23,7 --> 0:43:27,44
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: The middle class will
pay less, and people making a million dollars


704
0:43:27,44 --> 0:43:31,77
or more will begin to contribute slightly
more. Let me give you one concrete example:


705
0:43:31,77 --> 0:43:36,32
the continuation of the Bush tax cuts. We’re
arguing that the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy


706
0:43:36,32 --> 0:43:42,35
should be allowed to expire. Of the Bush tax
cuts for the wealthy, 800 million -- billion


707
0:43:42,35 --> 0:43:47,65
dollars of that goes to people making a minimum
of a million dollars. We see no justification


708
0:43:47,65 --> 0:43:52,35
in these economic times for those -- and they’re
patriotic Americans. They’re -- they’re


709
0:43:52,35 --> 0:43:57,8
not asking for this continued tax cut; they’re
not suggesting it; but my friends are insisting


710
0:43:57,8 --> 0:44:3,82
on it. A hundred and twenty thousand families,
by continuing that tax cut, will get an additional


711
0:44:3,82 --> 0:44:9,89
$500 billion in tax relief in the next 10
years, and their income is an average of $8


712
0:44:9,89 --> 0:44:10,6
million.


713
0:44:10,6 --> 0:44:17,21
We want to extend permanently the middle-class
tax cut for -- permanently from the Bush middle-class


714
0:44:17,21 --> 0:44:19,67
tax cut. These guys won’t allow us to.


715
0:44:19,67 --> 0:44:23,35
You what we’re saying? We say let’s have
a vote. Let’s have a vote on the middle-class


716
0:44:23,35 --> 0:44:28,6
tax cut, and let’s have a vote on the upper
tax cut. Let’s go ahead and vote on it.


717
0:44:28,6 --> 0:44:33,99
They’re saying no. They’re holding hostage
the middle-class tax cut to the super wealthy.


718
0:44:33,99 --> 0:44:39,2
And on top of that, they got another tax cut
coming that’s $5 trillion that all of the


719
0:44:39,2 --> 0:44:46,16
studies point out will, in fact, give another
$250 million dollar -- yeah, $250,000 a year


720
0:44:46,16 --> 0:44:52,58
to those 120,000 families and raise taxes
for people who are middle-income with a child


721
0:44:52,58 --> 0:44:59,27
by $2,000 a year. This is unconscionable.
There is no need for this. The middle class


722
0:44:59,27 --> 0:45:5,33
got knocked on their heels. The Great Recession
crushed them. They need some help now. The


723
0:45:5,33 --> 0:45:13,9
last people who need help are 120,000 families
for another -- another $500 billion tax cut


724
0:45:13,9 --> 0:45:15,2
over the next 10 years.


725
0:45:15,2 --> 0:45:16,99
MS. RADDATZ: Congressman.


726
0:45:16,99 --> 0:45:22,82
REP. RYAN: Our entire premise of these tax
reform plans is to grow the economy and create


727
0:45:22,82 --> 0:45:26,0
jobs. It’s a plan that’s estimated to
create 7 million jobs.


728
0:45:26,0 --> 0:45:33,45
Now, we think that government taking 28 percent
of a family and business’ income is enough.


729
0:45:33,45 --> 0:45:38,83
President Obama thinks that the government
ought to be able to take as much as 44.8 percent


730
0:45:38,83 --> 0:45:41,45
of a small business’ income.


731
0:45:41,45 --> 0:45:48,2
Look, if you taxed every person in successful
small business making over $250,000 at a hundred


732
0:45:48,2 --> 0:45:53,59
percent, it’d only run the government for
98 days. If everybody who paid income taxes


733
0:45:53,59 --> 0:45:57,64
last year, including successful small businesses,
doubled their income taxes this year, we’d


734
0:45:57,64 --> 0:45:59,98
still have a $300 billion deficit.


735
0:45:59,98 --> 0:46:5,51
You see, there aren’t enough rich people
and small businesses to tax to pay for all


736
0:46:5,51 --> 0:46:10,55
their spending. And so the next time you hear
them say, don’t worry about it, we’ll


737
0:46:10,55 --> 0:46:14,99
get a few wealthy people to pay their fair
share, watch out, middle class. The tax bill


738
0:46:14,99 --> 0:46:16,81
is coming to you.


739
0:46:16,81 --> 0:46:20,29
That’s why we’re saying we need fundamental
tax reform.


740
0:46:20,29 --> 0:46:25,4
Let’s take a look at it this way: 8-out-of-10
businesses, they file their taxes as individuals,


741
0:46:25,4 --> 0:46:30,26
not as corporations. And where I come from,
overseas, which is Lake Superior -- (chuckles)


742
0:46:30,26 --> 0:46:35,78
-- the Canadians -- they drop their tax rates
to 15 percent. The average tax rate on businesses


743
0:46:35,78 --> 0:46:40,29
in the industrialized world is 25 percent,
and the president wants the top effective


744
0:46:40,29 --> 0:46:46,9
tax rate on successful small businesses to
go above 40 percent. Two-thirds of our jobs


745
0:46:46,9 --> 0:46:52,83
come from small businesses. This one tax would
actually tax about 53 percent of small-business


746
0:46:52,83 --> 0:46:58,42
income. It’s expected that’d cost us 710,000
jobs. And you know what? It doesn’t even


747
0:46:58,42 --> 0:47:3,21
pay for 10 percent of their proposed deficit
spending increases.


748
0:47:3,21 --> 0:47:7,47
What we are saying is lower tax rates across
the board and close loopholes, primarily to


749
0:47:7,47 --> 0:47:12,99
the higher-income people. We have three bottom
lines: Don’t raise the deficit, don’t


750
0:47:12,99 --> 0:47:16,99
raise taxes on the middle class and don’t
lower the share of income that is borne by


751
0:47:16,99 --> 0:47:20,81
the high-income earners. He -- he’ll keep
saying this $5 trillion plan, I suppose --


752
0:47:20,81 --> 0:47:21,35
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.)


753
0:47:21,35 --> 0:47:26,15
REP. RYAN: -- it’s been discredited by six
other studies, and even their own deputy campaign


754
0:47:26,15 --> 0:47:28,24
manager acknowledged that it wasn’t correct.


755
0:47:28,24 --> 0:47:30,21
MS. RADDATZ: Well, let’s talk about this
20 percent.


756
0:47:30,21 --> 0:47:30,849
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well -- (chuckles) --


757
0:47:30,849 --> 0:47:37,43
MS. RADDATZ: You have refused yet again to
offer specifics on how you pay for that 20


758
0:47:37,43 --> 0:47:43,369
percent across-the-board tax cut. Do you actually
have the specifics, or are you still working


759
0:47:43,369 --> 0:47:45,57
on it, and that’s why you won’t tell voters?


760
0:47:45,57 --> 0:47:49,859
REP. RYAN: Different than this administration,
we actually want to have big bipartisan agreements.


761
0:47:49,859 --> 0:47:51,63
You see, I understand the --


762
0:47:51,63 --> 0:47:53,5
MS. RADDATZ: Do you have the specifics? Do
you have the math? Do you know exactly what


763
0:47:53,5 --> 0:47:53,5
you’re doing?


764
0:47:53,5 --> 0:47:55,3
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’ll be -- that’d
be a first for the Republican Congress.


765
0:47:55,3 --> 0:47:59,599
REP. RYAN: Look -- look at what Mitt -- look
at what Ronald Reagan and Tip O’Neill did.


766
0:47:59,599 --> 0:48:4,2
They worked together out of a framework to
lower tax rates and broaden the base, and


767
0:48:4,2 --> 0:48:8,81
they worked together to fix that. What we’re
saying is here’s our framework: Lower tax


768
0:48:8,81 --> 0:48:15,5
rates 20 percent -- we raise about $1.2 trillion
through income taxes. We forgo about 1.1 trillion


769
0:48:15,5 --> 0:48:20,6
(dollars) in loopholes and deductions. And
so what we’re saying is deny those loopholes


770
0:48:20,6 --> 0:48:24,88
and deductions to higher- income taxpayers
so that more of their income is taxed, which


771
0:48:24,88 --> 0:48:26,53
has a broader base of taxation --


772
0:48:26,53 --> 0:48:26,88
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Can I translate?


773
0:48:26,88 --> 0:48:28,88
REP. RYAN: -- so we can lower tax rates across
the board.


774
0:48:28,88 --> 0:48:32,56
Now, here’s why I’m saying this. What
we’re saying is here’s a framework --


775
0:48:32,56 --> 0:48:33,32
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I hope I’m going to
get time to respond to this.


776
0:48:33,32 --> 0:48:33,64
REP. RYAN: We want to work with Congress --


777
0:48:33,64 --> 0:48:34,42
MS. RADDATZ: I -- you’ll get time.


778
0:48:34,42 --> 0:48:39,99
REP. RYAN: We want to work with Congress on
how best to achieve this. That means successful


779
0:48:39,99 --> 0:48:39,29
-- look --


780
0:48:39,29 --> 0:48:39,89
MS. RADDATZ: No specifics, yeah.


781
0:48:39,89 --> 0:48:44,17
REP. RYAN: Mitt -- what we’re saying is
-- (laughter) -- lower tax rates 20 percent,


782
0:48:44,17 --> 0:48:46,3
start with the wealthy, work with Congress
to do it --


783
0:48:46,3 --> 0:48:48,32
MS. RADDATZ: And you guarantee this math will
add up.


784
0:48:48,32 --> 0:48:51,72
REP. RYAN: Absolutely. Six studies have guaranteed
-- six studies have verified that this math


785
0:48:51,72 --> 0:48:52,14
adds up, but here’s the other point --


786
0:48:52,14 --> 0:48:53,0
MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden --


787
0:48:53,0 --> 0:48:53,14
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Look --


788
0:48:53,14 --> 0:48:53,349
REP. RYAN: (Inaudible) -- one point -- (inaudible)
--


789
0:48:53,349 --> 0:48:54,13
MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden.


790
0:48:54,13 --> 0:48:56,32
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Let me translate. Let
me have a chance to translate.


791
0:48:56,32 --> 0:48:57,56
REP. RYAN: I’ll come back in a second then,
right?


792
0:48:57,56 --> 0:49:0,7
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: First of all, I was
there when Ronald Reagan tax breaks -- I mean,


793
0:49:0,7 --> 0:49:5,13
he gave specifics of what he was going to
cut, no -- number one, in terms of tax expenditures.


794
0:49:5,13 --> 0:49:12,81
Number two, 97 percent of the small businesses
of America pay less -- make less than $250,000.


795
0:49:12,81 --> 0:49:16,93
Let me tell you who some of those other small
businesses are: hedge funds that make 6(00


796
0:49:16,93 --> 0:49:21,34
million dollars), $800 million a year. That
-- that’s what they count as small business


797
0:49:21,34 --> 0:49:22,42
because they’re passthrough.


798
0:49:22,42 --> 0:49:27,38
Let’s look at how sincere they are. Ronald
-- I mean, excuse me, Governor Romney, on


799
0:49:27,38 --> 0:49:32,27
“60 Minutes,” I guess it’s about 10
days ago, was asked, Governor, you pay 14


800
0:49:32,27 --> 0:49:37,609
percent on $20 million. Someone making $50,000
pays more than that. Do you think that’s


801
0:49:37,609 --> 0:49:40,56
fair? He said, oh, yes, that’s fair; that’s
fair.


802
0:49:40,56 --> 0:49:43,21
This is -- and they’re going to talk -- I
mean, you think these guys are going to go


803
0:49:43,21 --> 0:49:47,27
out there and cut those loopholes? The loophole
-- the biggest loophole they take advantage


804
0:49:47,27 --> 0:49:52,3
of is the carried interest loophole and -- and
capital gains loophole. They exempt that.


805
0:49:52,3 --> 0:49:57,44
Now, there’s not enough -- the reason why
the AEI study, the American Enterprise Institute


806
0:49:57,44 --> 0:50:2,359
study, the Tax Policy Center study, the reason
they all say it’s going to -- taxes will


807
0:50:2,359 --> 0:50:8,73
go up on the middle class, the only way you
can find $5 trillion in loopholes is cut the


808
0:50:8,73 --> 0:50:12,88
mortgage deduction for middle-class people,
cut the health care deduction for middle-class


809
0:50:12,88 --> 0:50:18,32
people, take away their ability to get a tax
break to send their kids to college. That’s


810
0:50:18,32 --> 0:50:18,99
why they -- (inaudible) --


811
0:50:18,99 --> 0:50:19,859
MS. RADDATZ: Is he wrong about that?


812
0:50:19,859 --> 0:50:22,5
REP. RYAN: He is wrong about that. There are
-- you can --


813
0:50:22,5 --> 0:50:22,5
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: How’s that?


814
0:50:22,5 --> 0:50:26,29
REP. RYAN: You can cut tax rates by 20 percent
and still preserve these important preferences


815
0:50:26,29 --> 0:50:27,79
for middle-class taxpayers --


816
0:50:27,79 --> 0:50:29,16
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Not mathematically possible.


817
0:50:29,16 --> 0:50:31,92
REP. RYAN: It is mathematically possible.
It’s been done before. It’s precisely


818
0:50:31,92 --> 0:50:32,609
what we’re proposing.


819
0:50:32,609 --> 0:50:35,1
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.) It has never
been done before.


820
0:50:35,1 --> 0:50:36,119
REP. RYAN: It’s been done a couple of times,
actually.


821
0:50:36,119 --> 0:50:37,39
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: It has never been done
before.


822
0:50:37,39 --> 0:50:39,75
REP. RYAN: Jack Kennedy lowered tax rates,
increased growth. Ronald Reagan --


823
0:50:39,75 --> 0:50:40,5
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Oh, now you’re Jack
Kennedy.


824
0:50:40,5 --> 0:50:45,849
REP. RYAN: Ronald Reagan -- (laughter) -- (chuckles)
-- Republicans and Democrats --


825
0:50:45,849 --> 0:50:46,55
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: This is amazing.


826
0:50:46,55 --> 0:50:48,0
REP. RYAN: Republicans and Democrats have
worked together on this.


827
0:50:48,0 --> 0:50:48,81
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s right.


828
0:50:48,81 --> 0:50:50,69
REP. RYAN: I understand aren’t used to doing
bipartisan deals.


829
0:50:50,69 --> 0:50:52,38
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: But we told each other
what we were going to do. When we did with


830
0:50:52,38 --> 0:50:52,66
Reagan, he said --


831
0:50:52,66 --> 0:50:53,119
REP. RYAN: Republicans and Democrats --


832
0:50:53,119 --> 0:50:54,67
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- here -- here are
the things we’re going to cut. This is what


833
0:50:54,67 --> 0:50:54,79
he said.


834
0:50:54,79 --> 0:50:57,14
REP. RYAN: We can agree on a framework; let’s
work together to fill in the details. That’s


835
0:50:57,14 --> 0:50:57,369
exactly --


836
0:50:57,369 --> 0:50:57,81
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Fill in the details.


837
0:50:57,81 --> 0:50:59,89
REP. RYAN: That’s how you get things done.
You work with Congress --


838
0:50:59,89 --> 0:51:0,18
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Seriously ?).


839
0:51:0,18 --> 0:51:3,359
REP. RYAN: Look, let me say it this way. Mitt
Romney was governor --


840
0:51:3,359 --> 0:51:4,849
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s coming from
the Republican Congress working bipartisanly?


841
0:51:4,849 --> 0:51:5,81
REP. RYAN: Mitt -- Mitt Romney --


842
0:51:5,81 --> 0:51:7,33
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Seven percent rating?
Come on.


843
0:51:7,33 --> 0:51:11,79
REP. RYAN: Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts,
where 87 percent of the legislators he served


844
0:51:11,79 --> 0:51:16,31
with were Democrats. He didn’t demonize
them. He didn’t demagogue them. He met with


845
0:51:16,31 --> 0:51:17,66
those party leaders every week.


846
0:51:17,66 --> 0:51:18,33
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.)


847
0:51:18,33 --> 0:51:21,1
REP. RYAN: He reached across the aisle. He
didn’t compromise principles.


848
0:51:21,1 --> 0:51:22,6
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: And you (saw what happened
?).


849
0:51:22,6 --> 0:51:23,51
REP. RYAN: He found common ground, and he
balanced the budget.


850
0:51:23,51 --> 0:51:28,15
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (You saw what ?) -- if
he did such a great job -- if he did such


851
0:51:28,15 --> 0:51:28,92
a great job in Massachusetts --


852
0:51:28,92 --> 0:51:28,92
MS. RADDATZ: Vice President, what --


853
0:51:28,92 --> 0:51:29,24
REP. RYAN: He balanced the budget four times.
He balanced the budget four times without


854
0:51:29,24 --> 0:51:29,24
raising taxes.


855
0:51:29,24 --> 0:51:30,54
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- why isn’t he even
contesting Massachusetts?


856
0:51:30,54 --> 0:51:31,619
REP. RYAN: (Inaudible.)


857
0:51:31,619 --> 0:51:34,67
MS. RADDATZ: Vice President, what would you
suggest -- what would you suggest beyond raising


858
0:51:34,67 --> 0:51:37,99
taxes on the wealthy that would substantially
reduce the long-term deficit?


859
0:51:37,99 --> 0:51:41,26
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Not -- just let the
taxes expire like they’re supposed to on


860
0:51:41,26 --> 0:51:47,83
those millionaires. We don’t -- we can’t
afford $800 billion going to people making


861
0:51:47,83 --> 0:51:54,57
a minimum a million dollars. They do not need
it, Martha. Those 120,000 families make $8


862
0:51:54,57 --> 0:52:0,71
million a year. Middle-class people need the
help. Why does my friend cut out the tuition


863
0:52:0,71 --> 0:52:3,24
tax credit for them? Why does he go out after
the child -- (inaudible)?


864
0:52:3,24 --> 0:52:4,16
MS. RADDATZ: Can you declare anything off-limits
--


865
0:52:4,16 --> 0:52:5,22
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Why do they do that?


866
0:52:5,22 --> 0:52:7,15
MS. RADDATZ: Can you declare anything off
limits? Home mortgages deductions --


867
0:52:7,15 --> 0:52:9,58
REP. RYAN: Yeah. We’re saying close loopholes
on high-interest people--


868
0:52:9,58 --> 0:52:10,32
MS. RADDATZ: Home mortgage deductions --


869
0:52:10,32 --> 0:52:11,97
REP. RYAN: -- for higher-income people. Here
--


870
0:52:11,97 --> 0:52:13,98
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Can you guarantee that
no one --


871
0:52:13,98 --> 0:52:14,4
REP. RYAN: This taxes --


872
0:52:14,4 --> 0:52:16,33
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- making less than
$100,000 will have a mortgage --


873
0:52:16,33 --> 0:52:17,26
REP. RYAN: This --


874
0:52:17,26 --> 0:52:18,75
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- their mortgage deduction
impacted? Guarantee?


875
0:52:18,75 --> 0:52:21,23
REP. RYAN: This taxes a million small businesses.


876
0:52:21,23 --> 0:52:24,98
He keeps trying to make you think that it’s
just some movie star or hedge fund guy or


877
0:52:24,98 --> 0:52:25,39
an actor--


878
0:52:25,39 --> 0:52:28,89
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Ninety-seven percent
of the small businesses make less than $250,000


879
0:52:28,89 --> 0:52:29,599
a year --


880
0:52:29,599 --> 0:52:30,65
REP. RYAN: Joe --


881
0:52:30,65 --> 0:52:32,56
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- would not be affected.


882
0:52:32,56 --> 0:52:36,42
REP. RYAN: -- you know, it hits a million
-- this taxes a million people, a million


883
0:52:36,42 --> 0:52:37,2
small businesses --


884
0:52:37,2 --> 0:52:39,9
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Doesn’t tax 97 percent
of the American businesses -- small businesses


885
0:52:39,9 --> 0:52:39,9
--


886
0:52:39,9 --> 0:52:41,92
REP. RYAN: It -- it taxes a million small
businesses, who are our great job creators.


887
0:52:41,92 --> 0:52:43,46
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I wish I’d get it
-- the greatest job creators are the hedge


888
0:52:43,46 --> 0:52:43,68
fund guys.


889
0:52:43,68 --> 0:52:44,109
REP. RYAN: (Let’s end ?) --


890
0:52:44,109 --> 0:52:45,5
MS. RADDATZ: And you’re going -- and you’re
going to increase the defense budget.


891
0:52:45,5 --> 0:52:46,5
REP. RYAN: Think about it this way.


892
0:52:46,5 --> 0:52:48,71
MS. RADDATZ: And you’re going to increase
the defense budget.


893
0:52:48,71 --> 0:52:50,64
REP. RYAN: No, we’re just not going to cut
the defense budget like they’re -- they’re


894
0:52:50,64 --> 0:52:50,92
proposing --


895
0:52:50,92 --> 0:52:52,5
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: They’re going to increase
it $2 billion -- $2 trillion.


896
0:52:52,5 --> 0:52:54,18
REP. RYAN: That’s not accurate. We’re
talking about preventing --


897
0:52:54,18 --> 0:52:55,71
MS. RADDATZ: More than that. No -- so no massive
defense increase?


898
0:52:55,71 --> 0:52:58,65
REP. RYAN: No, we’re saying is, don’t
-- OK, you want to get into defense now?


899
0:52:58,65 --> 0:52:59,83
MS. RADDATZ: Let -- yes, I do. I do --


900
0:52:59,83 --> 0:53:0,43
REP. RYAN: All right. So --


901
0:53:0,43 --> 0:53:1,63
MS. RADDATZ: -- because that’s another math
question.


902
0:53:1,63 --> 0:53:2,15
REP. RYAN: Right. OK.


903
0:53:2,15 --> 0:53:3,6
MS. RADDATZ: How do you do that?


904
0:53:3,6 --> 0:53:9,25
REP. RYAN: So they proposed a $478 (sic) billion
cut to defense to begin with. Now we have


905
0:53:9,25 --> 0:53:14,83
another $500 billion cut to defense that’s
lurking on the horizon. They insisted upon


906
0:53:14,83 --> 0:53:17,32
that cut being involved in the debt negotiations
--


907
0:53:17,32 --> 0:53:17,75
MS. RADDATZ: Let --


908
0:53:17,75 --> 0:53:19,24
REP. RYAN: -- and now we have a $1 trillion
cut --


909
0:53:19,24 --> 0:53:20,91
MS. RADDATZ: Let’s put the automatic defense
cuts aside. OK?


910
0:53:20,91 --> 0:53:21,41
REP. RYAN: Right. OK.


911
0:53:21,41 --> 0:53:22,66
MS. RADDATZ: Let’s put those aside. No one
wants that.


912
0:53:22,66 --> 0:53:23,59
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I’d like to go back
to that.


913
0:53:23,59 --> 0:53:23,77
REP. RYAN: OK.


914
0:53:23,77 --> 0:53:27,42
MS. RADDATZ: But I want to know how you do
the math and have this increase in defense


915
0:53:27,42 --> 0:53:27,59
spending?


916
0:53:27,59 --> 0:53:28,599
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Two trillion dollars.


917
0:53:28,599 --> 0:53:32,26
REP. RYAN: You don’t cut defense by a trillion
dollars. That’s what we’re talking about.


918
0:53:32,26 --> 0:53:32,58
The additional trillion --


919
0:53:32,58 --> 0:53:36,3
MS. RADDATZ: And what national security issues
justify an increase?


920
0:53:36,3 --> 0:53:39,18
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Who’s cutting it by
a trillion?


921
0:53:39,18 --> 0:53:44,27
REP. RYAN: We’re going to cut 80,000 soldiers,
20,000 Marines, 120 cargo planes. We’re


922
0:53:44,27 --> 0:53:45,79
going to push the Joint Strike Fighter out.


923
0:53:45,79 --> 0:53:47,14
MS. RADDATZ: Drawing down in one war --


924
0:53:47,14 --> 0:53:47,58
REP. RYAN: We’re cutting missile defense.


925
0:53:47,58 --> 0:53:48,53
MS. RADDATZ: -- and one war -- (inaudible
) --


926
0:53:48,53 --> 0:53:52,68
REP. RYAN: If these cuts go through, our Navy
will be the small it is -- it -- the smallest


927
0:53:52,68 --> 0:53:57,599
it has been since before World War I. This
invites weakness.


928
0:53:57,599 --> 0:54:1,77
Look, do we believe in peace through strength?
You bet we do. And that means you don’t


929
0:54:1,77 --> 0:54:6,6
impose these devastating cuts on our military.
So we’re saying don’t cut the military


930
0:54:6,6 --> 0:54:10,54
by a trillion dollars, not increase it by
a trillion, don’t cut it by a trillion dollars.


931
0:54:10,54 --> 0:54:12,849
MS. RADDATZ: Quickly, Vice President Biden,
on this, and I want to move on.


932
0:54:12,849 --> 0:54:15,91
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Look, we don’t cut
it. And I might add this so-called -- I know


933
0:54:15,91 --> 0:54:20,44
we don’t want to use the fancy word “sequester,”
this automatic cut -- that was part of a debt


934
0:54:20,44 --> 0:54:22,99
deal that they asked for.


935
0:54:22,99 --> 0:54:25,74
And let me tell you what my friend said at
a press conference announcing his support


936
0:54:25,74 --> 0:54:30,42
of the deal. He said -- and I’m -- we’ve
been looking for this moment for a long time.


937
0:54:30,42 --> 0:54:30,609
(Inaudible) --


938
0:54:30,609 --> 0:54:32,26
REP. RYAN: Can I tell you what that meant?


939
0:54:32,26 --> 0:54:33,18
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Why --


940
0:54:33,18 --> 0:54:34,98
REP. RYAN: We’ve been looking for bipartisanship
for a long time.


941
0:54:34,98 --> 0:54:38,69
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: And so the bipartisanship
is what he voted for: the automatic cuts in


942
0:54:38,69 --> 0:54:43,859
defense if they didn’t act. And beyond that,
they asked for another -- look, the military


943
0:54:43,859 --> 0:54:50,14
says, we need a smaller, leaner Army. We need
more special forces. We need -- we don’t


944
0:54:50,14 --> 0:54:52,67
need more M1 tanks. What we need is more UADs.


945
0:54:52,67 --> 0:54:53,7
MS. RADDATZ: Some of the military -- I know
that’s -- (inaudible) --


946
0:54:53,7 --> 0:54:58,41
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Not some of the military;
that was the decision of the Joint Chiefs


947
0:54:58,41 --> 0:55:2,609
of Staff, recommended to us and agreed to
by the president. That’s a fact.


948
0:55:2,609 --> 0:55:3,839
MS. RADDATZ: Who answers to the civilian leaders.


949
0:55:3,839 --> 0:55:6,589
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: They made the recommendation
first.


950
0:55:6,589 --> 0:55:8,359
MS. RADDATZ: OK. Let’s move on to Afghanistan.


951
0:55:8,359 --> 0:55:9,599
REP. RYAN: Can I get into that for a second?


952
0:55:9,599 --> 0:55:10,869
MS. RADDATZ: I’d like to move on to Afghanistan,
please.


953
0:55:10,869 --> 0:55:11,57
REP. RYAN: OK.


954
0:55:11,57 --> 0:55:15,66
MS. RADDATZ: And that’s one of the biggest
expenditures this country has made, in dollars


955
0:55:15,66 --> 0:55:22,74
and, more importantly, in lives. We just passed
the sad milestone of losing 2,000 U.S. troops


956
0:55:22,74 --> 0:55:28,109
there in this war. More than 50 of them were
killed this year by the very Afghan forces


957
0:55:28,109 --> 0:55:34,66
we are trying to help. Now, we’ve reached
the recruiting goal for Afghan forces. We’ve


958
0:55:34,66 --> 0:55:41,23
degraded al-Qaida. So tell me, why not leave
now? What more can we really accomplish? Is


959
0:55:41,23 --> 0:55:42,57
it worth more American lives?


960
0:55:42,57 --> 0:55:47,43
REP. RYAN: We don’t want to lose the gains
we’ve gotten. We want to make sure that


961
0:55:47,43 --> 0:55:52,53
the Taliban does not come back in and give
al- Qaida a safe haven. We agree with the


962
0:55:52,53 --> 0:55:58,109
administration on their 2014 transition. Look,
when I think about Afghanistan, I think about


963
0:55:58,109 --> 0:56:2,48
the incredible job that our troops have done.
You’ve been there more than the two of us


964
0:56:2,48 --> 0:56:3,869
combined.


965
0:56:3,869 --> 0:56:8,99
First time I was there in 2002, it was amazing
to me what they were facing. When I went to


966
0:56:8,99 --> 0:56:14,4
the Arghandab Valley in Kandahar before the
surge, I sat down with a young private in


967
0:56:14,4 --> 0:56:17,63
the 82nd from the Menominee Indian Reservation
who would tell me what he did every day, and


968
0:56:17,63 --> 0:56:21,849
I was in awe. And to see what they had in
front of them -- and then to go back there


969
0:56:21,849 --> 0:56:25,32
in December, to go throughout Helmand with
the Marines to see what they had accomplished


970
0:56:25,32 --> 0:56:28,359
-- it’s nothing short of amazing.


971
0:56:28,359 --> 0:56:32,28
What we don’t want to do is lose the gains
we’ve gotten.


972
0:56:32,28 --> 0:56:36,9
Now, we’ve disagreed from time to time on
a few issues. We would have more likely taken


973
0:56:36,9 --> 0:56:42,4
into account the recommendations from our
commanders, General Petraeus, Admiral Mullen,


974
0:56:42,4 --> 0:56:46,96
on troop levels throughout this year’s fighting
season. We’ve been skeptical about negotiations


975
0:56:46,96 --> 0:56:51,9
with the Taliban, especially while they’re
shooting at us. But we want to see the 2014


976
0:56:51,9 --> 0:56:57,359
transition be successful. And that means we
want to make sure our commanders have what


977
0:56:57,359 --> 0:57:2,7
they need to make sure that it is successful
so that this does not once again become a


978
0:57:2,7 --> 0:57:3,7
launching pad for terrorists.


979
0:57:3,7 --> 0:57:4,849
MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden.


980
0:57:4,849 --> 0:57:8,43
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Martha, let’s keep
our eye on the ball. The reason I’ve been


981
0:57:8,43 --> 0:57:14,2
in and out of Afghanistan and Iraq 20 times
-- I’ve been up in the Kunar -- I’ve been


982
0:57:14,2 --> 0:57:20,3
throughout that whole country, mostly in a
helicopter and sometimes in a vehicle. The


983
0:57:20,3 --> 0:57:26,5
fact is we went there for one reason: to get
those people who killed Americans, al-Qaida.


984
0:57:26,5 --> 0:57:34,2
We’ve decimated al-Qaida central. We have
eliminated Osama bin Laden. That was our purpose.


985
0:57:34,2 --> 0:57:39,49
And in fact, in the meantime, what we said
we would do, we would help train the Afghan


986
0:57:39,49 --> 0:57:46,66
military. It’s their responsibility to take
over their own security. That’s why, with


987
0:57:46,66 --> 0:57:53,859
49 of our allies in Afghanistan, we’ve agreed
on a gradual drawdown so we’re out of there


988
0:57:53,859 --> 0:57:58,83
by the year -- in the year 2014.


989
0:57:58,83 --> 0:58:3,869
My friend and the governor say it’s based
on conditions, which means it depends. It


990
0:58:3,869 --> 0:58:12,119
does not depend for us. It is the responsibility
of the Afghans to take care of their own security.


991
0:58:12,119 --> 0:58:18,9
We have trained over 315,000, mostly without
incident. There have been more than two dozen


992
0:58:18,9 --> 0:58:22,109
cases of green on blue where Americans have
been killed.


993
0:58:22,109 --> 0:58:27,44
If we do -- if the -- if the measures the
military has taken do not take hold, we will


994
0:58:27,44 --> 0:58:34,71
not go on joint patrols, we will not train
in the field. We’ll only train in the -- in


995
0:58:34,71 --> 0:58:37,2
the Army bases that exist there.


996
0:58:37,2 --> 0:58:44,49
But we are leaving. We are leaving in 2014,
period, and in the process, we’re going


997
0:58:44,49 --> 0:58:50,26
to be saving over the next 10 years another
$800 billion. We’ve been in this war for


998
0:58:50,26 --> 0:58:57,25
over a decade. The primary objective is almost
completed. Now all we’re doing is putting


999
0:58:57,25 --> 0:59:3,369
the Kabul government in a position to be able
to maintain their own security. It’s their


1000
0:59:3,369 --> 0:59:5,67
responsibility, not America’s.


1001
0:59:5,67 --> 0:59:9,619
MS. RADDATZ: What conditions could justify
staying, Congressman Ryan?


1002
0:59:9,619 --> 0:59:14,609
REP. RYAN: We don’t want to stay. We want
-- look, one of my best friends in Janesville,


1003
0:59:14,609 --> 0:59:19,88
a reservist, is at a forward operating base
in Eastern Afghanistan right now. Our wives


1004
0:59:19,88 --> 0:59:25,26
are best friends, our daughters are best friends.
I want -- I want him and all of our troops


1005
0:59:25,26 --> 0:59:29,1
to come home as soon and safely as possible.


1006
0:59:29,1 --> 0:59:33,38
We want to make sure that 2014 is successful.
That’s why we want to make sure that we


1007
0:59:33,38 --> 0:59:37,26
give our commanders what they say they need
to make it successful. We don’t want to


1008
0:59:37,26 --> 0:59:39,98
extend beyond 2014. That’s the point we’re
making.


1009
0:59:39,98 --> 0:59:46,99
You know, if it was just this, I feel like
we would -- we would be able to call this


1010
0:59:46,99 --> 0:59:52,2
a success, but it’s not. What we are witnessing
as we turn on our television screens these


1011
0:59:52,2 --> 0:59:58,76
days, is the absolute unraveling of the Obama
foreign policy. Problems are growing at home,


1012
0:59:58,76 --> 1:0:2,63
but jobs -- problems are growing abroad, but
jobs aren’t growing here at home.


1013
1:0:2,63 --> 1:0:9,49
MS. RADDATZ: Let me go back to this. He says
we’re absolutely leaving in 2014. You’re


1014
1:0:9,49 --> 1:0:13,76
saying that’s not an absolute, but you won’t
talk about what conditions would justify --


1015
1:0:13,76 --> 1:0:14,609
REP. RYAN: Do you know why we say that? Do
you know why we say that?


1016
1:0:14,609 --> 1:0:15,5
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I’d like to know why.


1017
1:0:15,5 --> 1:0:19,78
REP. RYAN: Because we don’t want to broadcast
to our enemies, put a date on your calendar,


1018
1:0:19,78 --> 1:0:20,75
wait us out and then come back.


1019
1:0:20,75 --> 1:0:21,119
We want to make sure --


1020
1:0:21,119 --> 1:0:22,349
MS. RADDATZ: But you agree with the timeline?


1021
1:0:22,349 --> 1:0:28,349
REP. RYAN: We do -- we do agree with the timeline
in the transition, but what we -- what any


1022
1:0:28,349 --> 1:0:34,3
administration will do in 2013 is assess the
situation to see how best to complete this


1023
1:0:34,3 --> 1:0:36,3
timeline. What we do not want to do --


1024
1:0:36,3 --> 1:0:37,359
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: We will leave in 2014.


1025
1:0:37,359 --> 1:0:43,52
REP. RYAN: What we do not want to do is give
our allies reason to trust us less and our


1026
1:0:43,52 --> 1:0:49,359
enemies more -- we don’t want to embolden
our enemies to hold and wait out for us and


1027
1:0:49,359 --> 1:0:50,25
then take over the --


1028
1:0:50,25 --> 1:0:50,91
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Martha, that’s a bizarre
statement.


1029
1:0:50,91 --> 1:0:53,22
REP. RYAN: That’s why we want to make sure
-- no, that’s why we want to make sure that


1030
1:0:53,22 --> 1:0:53,78
this -- that --


1031
1:0:53,78 --> 1:0:57,18
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s a bizarre statement,
since 49 of our allies -- hear me, 49 of our


1032
1:0:57,18 --> 1:1:0,839
allies signed onto this position, 49.


1033
1:1:0,839 --> 1:1:2,67
REP. RYAN: And we’re reading that they want
to pull out early.


1034
1:1:2,67 --> 1:1:7,91
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Forty-nine. Forty-nine
of our allies said out in 2014. It’s the


1035
1:1:7,91 --> 1:1:12,17
responsibility of the Afghans. We have other
responsibilities --


1036
1:1:12,17 --> 1:1:12,28
REP. RYAN: Which is -- which is -- which is
what we agree with.


1037
1:1:12,28 --> 1:1:15,53
MS. RADDATZ: Do you -- do you think that this
timeline -- but we have -- we have soldiers


1038
1:1:15,53 --> 1:1:16,369
and Marines --


1039
1:1:16,369 --> 1:1:16,369
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Theirs are sufficient.
?)


1040
1:1:16,369 --> 1:1:22,58
MS. RADDATZ: We have Afghan forces murdering
our forces over there. The Taliban is, do


1041
1:1:22,58 --> 1:1:24,72
you think, taking advantage of this timeline?


1042
1:1:24,72 --> 1:1:29,5
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, look, the Taliban
-- what we’ve found out -- and we -- you


1043
1:1:29,5 --> 1:1:36,93
-- you saw it in Iraq, Martha. Unless you
set a timeline, Baghdad in the case of Iraq


1044
1:1:36,93 --> 1:1:42,349
and -- and Kabul in the case of Afghanistan
will not step up. They’re happy to let us


1045
1:1:42,349 --> 1:1:47,839
continue to do the job -- international security
forces to do the job. The only way they step


1046
1:1:47,839 --> 1:1:54,14
up is say, fellas, we’re leaving; we’ve
trained you; step up. Step up.


1047
1:1:54,14 --> 1:1:55,46
MS. RADDATZ: But let me -- let me go back
--


1048
1:1:55,46 --> 1:1:56,63
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s the only way
it works.


1049
1:1:56,63 --> 1:2:1,57
MS. RADDATZ: Let me go back to the surge troops
that we put in there. And you brought this


1050
1:2:1,57 --> 1:2:6,55
up, Congressman Ryan. I have talked to a lot
of troops. I’ve talked to senior officers


1051
1:2:6,55 --> 1:2:12,72
who were concerned that the surge troops were
pulled out during the fighting season, and


1052
1:2:12,72 --> 1:2:17,38
some of them saw that as a political -- as
a political move. So can you tell me, Vice


1053
1:2:17,38 --> 1:2:22,68
President Biden, what was the military reason
for bringing those surge troops home before


1054
1:2:22,68 --> 1:2:23,71
the fighting season ended?


1055
1:2:23,71 --> 1:2:25,589
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: The military reason
was bringing -- by the way, when the president


1056
1:2:25,589 --> 1:2:31,26
announced the surge -- you’ll remember,
Martha -- he said, the surge will be out by


1057
1:2:31,26 --> 1:2:37,119
the end of the summer. The military said,
the surge will be out. Nothing political about


1058
1:2:37,119 --> 1:2:42,52
this. Before the surge occurred -- so you
be a little straight with me here, too -- before


1059
1:2:42,52 --> 1:2:47,109
the surge occurred, we said, they’ll be
out by the end of the summer. That’s what


1060
1:2:47,109 --> 1:2:49,89
the military said. The reason for that is
--


1061
1:2:49,89 --> 1:2:53,519
MS. RADDATZ: Military follows orders. They
-- I mean, there -- trust me, there are people


1062
1:2:53,519 --> 1:2:53,52
--


1063
1:2:53,52 --> 1:2:53,96
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Sure --


1064
1:2:53,96 --> 1:2:55,92
MS. RADDATZ: -- who were concerned about pulling
out on the fighting season.


1065
1:2:55,92 --> 1:2:59,42
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: But -- there are people
that were concerned, but not the Joint Chiefs.


1066
1:2:59,42 --> 1:3:4,5
That was their recommendation in the Oval
Office to the president of the United States


1067
1:3:4,5 --> 1:3:8,96
of America. I sat there. I’m sure you’ll
find someone who disagrees with the Pentagon.


1068
1:3:8,96 --> 1:3:13,63
I’m positive you’ll find that within the
military. But that’s not the case here.


1069
1:3:13,63 --> 1:3:20,77
And secondly, the reason why the military
said that is you cannot wait and have a cliff.


1070
1:3:20,77 --> 1:3:26,829
It takes, you know, months and months and
months to draw down forces. (Inaudible) -- cannot


1071
1:3:26,829 --> 1:3:27,6
wait --


1072
1:3:27,6 --> 1:3:30,6
REP. RYAN: Let me bring some -- let me try
and illustrate the issue here, because I think


1073
1:3:30,6 --> 1:3:34,619
this -- it can get a little confusing. We’ve
all met with General Allen and General Scaparotti


1074
1:3:34,619 --> 1:3:39,23
in Afghanistan to talk about fighting seasons.
Here’s the way it works. The mountain passes


1075
1:3:39,23 --> 1:3:45,99
fill in with snow. The Taliban and the terrorists
and the Haqqani and the Quetta shura come


1076
1:3:45,99 --> 1:3:49,91
over from Pakistan to fight our men and women.
When it fills in with snow, they can’t do


1077
1:3:49,91 --> 1:3:54,329
it. That’s what we call fighting seasons.
In the warm months fighting gets really high;


1078
1:3:54,329 --> 1:3:56,28
in the winter it goes down.


1079
1:3:56,28 --> 1:4:2,859
And so when Admiral Mullen and General Petraeus
came to Congress and said, if you pull these


1080
1:4:2,859 --> 1:4:7,99
people out before the fighting season is end,
it puts people more at risk -- that’s the


1081
1:4:7,99 --> 1:4:13,78
problem. Yes, we drew 22,000 troops down last
month. But the remaining troops that are there,


1082
1:4:13,78 --> 1:4:18,79
who still have the same mission to prosecute,
counterinsurgency, are doing it with fewer


1083
1:4:18,79 --> 1:4:20,43
people.


1084
1:4:20,43 --> 1:4:21,32
That makes them less safe.


1085
1:4:21,32 --> 1:4:21,77
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Inaudible.)


1086
1:4:21,77 --> 1:4:27,46
REP. RYAN: We’re sending fewer people out
in all these hot spots to do the same job


1087
1:4:27,46 --> 1:4:28,8
that they were supposed to do a month ago
--


1088
1:4:28,8 --> 1:4:29,48
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Because we turned it
over --


1089
1:4:29,48 --> 1:4:32,29
REP. RYAN: -- but we took 22,000 people out
for them to do it.


1090
1:4:32,29 --> 1:4:36,359
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- we turned it over
to the Afghan troops we trained. No one got


1091
1:4:36,359 --> 1:4:42,94
pulled out that didn’t get filled in by
trained Afghan personnel. And he’s -- he’s


1092
1:4:42,94 --> 1:4:49,18
-- he’s conflating two issues. The fighting
season that Petraeus was talking about and


1093
1:4:49,18 --> 1:4:54,77
former -- and Admiral Mullen was the fighting
season this spring. That’s what he was talking


1094
1:4:54,77 --> 1:4:57,64
about. We did not -- we did not pull them
out.


1095
1:4:57,64 --> 1:4:59,38
REP. RYAN: The calendar works the same every
year. (Chuckles.)


1096
1:4:59,38 --> 1:5:2,99
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: It does work the same
every year. (Inaudible) -- there --


1097
1:5:2,99 --> 1:5:6,57
REP. RYAN: (Chuckles.) Spring, summer, fall
-- (chuckles) -- it’s warm or it’s not.


1098
1:5:6,57 --> 1:5:10,43
They’re still fighting us, they’re still
coming over the passes, they’ll -- they’re


1099
1:5:10,43 --> 1:5:16,24
still coming in to Zabul or to Kunar, to all
of these areas, but we are sending fewer people


1100
1:5:16,24 --> 1:5:17,92
to the front to fight them. And that is not
safe.


1101
1:5:17,92 --> 1:5:21,109
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s right, because
that’s the Afghan responsibility. We’ve


1102
1:5:21,109 --> 1:5:21,67
trained them.


1103
1:5:21,67 --> 1:5:22,869
REP. RYAN: Not in the East.


1104
1:5:22,869 --> 1:5:24,72
MS. RADDATZ: Let’s move -- let’s move
to another war.


1105
1:5:24,72 --> 1:5:26,99
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Not in the East? (Inaudible)
--


1106
1:5:26,99 --> 1:5:26,96
REP. RYAN: (Inaudible) -- East, RC-East --


1107
1:5:26,96 --> 1:5:29,4
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: RC-East, most dangerous
place in the world.


1108
1:5:29,4 --> 1:5:30,71
REP. RYAN: That’s why -- that’s why we
don’t want to send fewer people to do the


1109
1:5:30,71 --> 1:5:30,79
job.


1110
1:5:30,79 --> 1:5:32,63
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s -- that’s
why we should send Americans in to do the


1111
1:5:32,63 --> 1:5:36,79
job instead of the -- you’d rather Americans
be going in and doing the job instead of -- (inaudible)


1112
1:5:36,79 --> 1:5:36,79
--


1113
1:5:36,79 --> 1:5:38,32
REP. RYAN: No. We are already sending Americans
to do the job --


1114
1:5:38,32 --> 1:5:38,32
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: No --


1115
1:5:38,32 --> 1:5:39,28
REP. RYAN: -- but fewer of them. That’s
the whole point.


1116
1:5:39,28 --> 1:5:42,41
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That -- that’s right.
We’re sending in more Afghans to do the


1117
1:5:42,41 --> 1:5:45,27
job, Afghans to do the job.


1118
1:5:45,27 --> 1:5:50,599
MS. RADDATZ: Let’s move to another war,
the civil war in Syria, where there are estimates


1119
1:5:50,599 --> 1:5:56,73
that -- estimates that more than 25,000, 30,000
people have now been killed. In March of last


1120
1:5:56,73 --> 1:6:2,339
year, President Obama explained the military
action taken in Libya by saying it was in


1121
1:6:2,339 --> 1:6:8,48
the national interest to go in and prevent
further massacres from occurring there. So


1122
1:6:8,48 --> 1:6:13,13
why doesn’t the same logic apply in Syria?
Vice President Biden.


1123
1:6:13,13 --> 1:6:16,99
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: It’s a different country.
It’s a different country. It is five times


1124
1:6:16,99 --> 1:6:22,55
as large geographically. It has one-fifth
the population that is Libya, one-fifth the


1125
1:6:22,55 --> 1:6:24,96
population, five times as large geographically.


1126
1:6:24,96 --> 1:6:29,32
It’s in a part of the world where you’re
not going to see whatever would come from


1127
1:6:29,32 --> 1:6:35,49
that war. It’s (seep ?) into a regional
war. You’re in a country that is heavily


1128
1:6:35,49 --> 1:6:41,43
populated in the midst of the most dangerous
area in the world. And in fact, if, in fact,


1129
1:6:41,43 --> 1:6:47,26
it blows up and the wrong people gain control,
it’s going to have impact on the entire


1130
1:6:47,26 --> 1:6:49,73
region, causing potentially regional wars.


1131
1:6:49,73 --> 1:6:55,69
We are working hand in glove with the Turks,
with the Jordanians, with the Saudis and with


1132
1:6:55,69 --> 1:7:1,7
all the people in the region attempting to
identify the people who deserve the help so


1133
1:7:1,7 --> 1:7:7,0
that when Assad goes and he will go, there
will be a legitimate government that follows


1134
1:7:7,0 --> 1:7:10,95
on, not an al-Qaida-sponsored government that
follows on.


1135
1:7:10,95 --> 1:7:16,77
And all this loose talk of my friend, Governor
Romney, and the congressman about how we’re


1136
1:7:16,77 --> 1:7:22,22
going to do, we could do so much more in there,
what more would they do other than put American


1137
1:7:22,22 --> 1:7:28,21
boots on the ground? The last thing America
needs is to get into another ground war in


1138
1:7:28,21 --> 1:7:34,3
the Middle East requiring tens of thousands
if not well over a hundred thousand American


1139
1:7:34,3 --> 1:7:38,609
forces. That -- they are the facts. They are
the facts.


1140
1:7:38,609 --> 1:7:44,74
Now, every time the governor is asked about
this, he doesn’t say any -- he say -- he


1141
1:7:44,74 --> 1:7:49,72
goes up with a whole lot of verbiage, but
when he gets pressed, he says, no, he would


1142
1:7:49,72 --> 1:7:54,71
not do anything different then we are doing
now. Are they proposing putting American troops


1143
1:7:54,71 --> 1:7:59,0
on the ground, putting American aircraft in
their airspace? Is that what they’re proposing?


1144
1:7:59,0 --> 1:8:4,99
If they do, they should speak up and say so.
But that’s not what they’re saying.


1145
1:8:4,99 --> 1:8:12,579
We are doing it exactly like we need to do
to identify those forces who, in fact, will


1146
1:8:12,579 --> 1:8:19,29
provide for a stable government and not cause
a regional Sunni-Shia war when Bassad (ph)


1147
1:8:19,29 --> 1:8:20,73
-- when Bashir (sic; Bashar) Assad falls.


1148
1:8:20,73 --> 1:8:22,2
MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan.


1149
1:8:22,2 --> 1:8:27,25
REP. RYAN: Nobody is proposing to send troops
to Syria -- American troops.


1150
1:8:27,25 --> 1:8:32,71
Now let me say it this way. How would we do
things differently? We wouldn’t refer Bashar


1151
1:8:32,71 --> 1:8:39,569
Assad as a reformer when he’s killing his
own civilians with his Russian-provided weapons.


1152
1:8:39,569 --> 1:8:45,2
We wouldn’t be outsourcing our foreign policy
to the United Nations, giving Vladimir Putin


1153
1:8:45,2 --> 1:8:50,71
veto power over our efforts to try and deal
with this issue. He’s vetoed three of them.


1154
1:8:50,71 --> 1:8:55,339
Hillary Clinton went to Russia to try and
convince him not to do so; they thwarted her


1155
1:8:55,339 --> 1:8:58,549
efforts. She said they were on the wrong side
of history. She was right about that. This


1156
1:8:58,549 --> 1:9:2,19
is just one more example of how the Russia
reset’s not working.


1157
1:9:2,19 --> 1:9:6,85
And so where are we? After international pressure
mounted, then President Obama said Bashar


1158
1:9:6,85 --> 1:9:12,21
Assad should go. It’s been over a year.
The man has slaughtered tens of thousands


1159
1:9:12,21 --> 1:9:17,69
of his own people and more foreign fighters
are spilling into this country. So the longer


1160
1:9:17,69 --> 1:9:24,52
this has gone on, the more people -- groups
like al-Qaida are going in. We could have


1161
1:9:24,52 --> 1:9:30,2
more easily identified the Free Syrian Army,
the freedom fighters, working with our allies,


1162
1:9:30,2 --> 1:9:36,19
the Turks, the Qataris, the Saudis, had we
had a better plan in place to begin with,


1163
1:9:36,19 --> 1:9:41,92
working through our allies. But no, we waited
for Kofi Annan to try and come up with an


1164
1:9:41,92 --> 1:9:47,68
agreement through the U.N. That bought Bashar
Assad time. We gave Russia veto power over


1165
1:9:47,68 --> 1:9:52,48
our efforts through the U.N. and meanwhile
about 30,000 Syrians are dead.


1166
1:9:52,48 --> 1:9:58,15
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: What would my friend
do differently? If you notice, he never answers


1167
1:9:58,15 --> 1:9:58,52
the question.


1168
1:9:58,52 --> 1:10:1,68
REP. RYAN: No, I would -- I -- we would not
be going through the U.N. on all of these


1169
1:10:1,68 --> 1:10:1,94
things --


1170
1:10:1,94 --> 1:10:4,969
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Let -- let -- let me
-- you don’t go through the U.N. We are


1171
1:10:4,969 --> 1:10:11,739
in the process now and have been for months
in making sure that help, humanitarian aid,


1172
1:10:11,739 --> 1:10:18,3
as well as other aid and training, is getting
to those forces that we believe, the Turks


1173
1:10:18,3 --> 1:10:25,2
believe, the Jordanians believe, the Saudis
believe are the free forces inside of Syria.


1174
1:10:25,2 --> 1:10:32,57
That is under way. Our allies were all on
the same page, NATO as well as our Arab allies,


1175
1:10:32,57 --> 1:10:38,66
in terms of trying to get a settlement. That
was their idea. We’re the ones that said,


1176
1:10:38,66 --> 1:10:39,11
enough.


1177
1:10:39,11 --> 1:10:44,55
With regard to the reset not working, the
fact of the matter is that Russia has a different


1178
1:10:44,55 --> 1:10:47,69
interest in Syria than we do, and that’s
not in our interest.


1179
1:10:47,69 --> 1:10:53,199
MS. RADDATZ: What happens if Assad does not
fall? Congressman Ryan, what happens to the


1180
1:10:53,199 --> 1:10:56,3
region? What happens if he hangs on? What
happens if he does?


1181
1:10:56,3 --> 1:11:1,64
REP. RYAN: Then Iran keeps their greatest
ally in the region. He’s a sponsor of terrorism.


1182
1:11:1,64 --> 1:11:5,59
He’ll probably continue slaughtering his
people. We and the world community will lose


1183
1:11:5,59 --> 1:11:8,55
our credibility on this. Look, he mentioned
the reset.


1184
1:11:8,55 --> 1:11:10,96
MS. RADDATZ: So what would Romney-Ryan do
about that credibility?


1185
1:11:10,96 --> 1:11:15,82
REP. RYAN: Well, we agree with the same red
line, actually, they do on chemical weapons,


1186
1:11:15,82 --> 1:11:19,5
but not putting American troops in, other
than to secure those chemical weapons. They’re


1187
1:11:19,5 --> 1:11:26,12
right about that. But what we should have
done earlier is work with those freedom fighters,


1188
1:11:26,12 --> 1:11:32,17
those dissidents in Syria. We should not have
called Bashar Assad a reformer, and we should


1189
1:11:32,17 --> 1:11:34,18
not have -- we should not have waited to Russia
to give us the green light --


1190
1:11:34,18 --> 1:11:34,3
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: We didn’t call Assad
--


1191
1:11:34,3 --> 1:11:34,96
MS. RADDATZ: What’s your criteria for --


1192
1:11:34,96 --> 1:11:39,81
REP. RYAN: We should not have waited for Russia
to give us the green light at the U.N. to


1193
1:11:39,81 --> 1:11:40,46
do something about it.


1194
1:11:40,46 --> 1:11:40,719
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Russia --


1195
1:11:40,719 --> 1:11:45,67
REP. RYAN: They’re -- they’re still arming
the man. Iran is flying flights over Iraq


1196
1:11:45,67 --> 1:11:45,67
--


1197
1:11:45,67 --> 1:11:47,57
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: And the opposition is
being armed --


1198
1:11:47,57 --> 1:11:51,5
REP. RYAN: -- to help -- to help -- to help
Bashar Assad. And by the way, if we had the


1199
1:11:51,5 --> 1:11:55,44
status of forces agreement that the vice president
said he would bet his vice presidency on in


1200
1:11:55,44 --> 1:11:59,29
Iraq, we probably would have been able to
prevent that. But he failed to achieve that


1201
1:11:59,29 --> 1:12:0,7
as well. Again --


1202
1:12:0,7 --> 1:12:2,98
MS. RADDATZ: Let me ask you quickly, what’s
your criteria for intervention?


1203
1:12:2,98 --> 1:12:3,93
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I don’t -- yeah.


1204
1:12:3,93 --> 1:12:4,699
REP. RYAN: In Syria?


1205
1:12:4,699 --> 1:12:5,93
MS. RADDATZ: Worldwide.


1206
1:12:5,93 --> 1:12:8,39
REP. RYAN: What is in the national interests
of the American people.


1207
1:12:8,39 --> 1:12:8,98
MS. RADDATZ: How about humanitarian interests?


1208
1:12:8,98 --> 1:12:12,11
REP. RYAN: What is in the national security
of the American people -- it’s got to be


1209
1:12:12,11 --> 1:12:14,35
in the strategic national interests of our
country.


1210
1:12:14,35 --> 1:12:16,26
MS. RADDATZ: No humanitarian?


1211
1:12:16,26 --> 1:12:21,92
REP. RYAN: Each situation will -- will come
up with its own set of circumstances. But


1212
1:12:21,92 --> 1:12:26,52
putting American troops on the ground, that’s
got to be within the national security interests


1213
1:12:26,52 --> 1:12:27,38
of the American people.


1214
1:12:27,38 --> 1:12:29,6
MS. RADDATZ: I want to -- we’re almost out
of time here.


1215
1:12:29,6 --> 1:12:33,46
REP. RYAN: That means things like embargoes
and sanctions and overflights -- those are


1216
1:12:33,46 --> 1:12:36,25
things that don’t put American troops on
the ground. But if you’re talking about


1217
1:12:36,25 --> 1:12:40,76
putting American troops on the ground, only
in our national security interests.


1218
1:12:40,76 --> 1:12:45,81
MS. RADDATZ: I want to move on, and I want
to return home for these last few questions.


1219
1:12:45,81 --> 1:12:52,9
This debate is indeed historic. We have two
Catholic candidates, first time on a stage


1220
1:12:52,9 --> 1:12:58,56
such as this, and I would like to ask you
both to tell me what role your religion has


1221
1:12:58,56 --> 1:13:7,739
played in your own personal views on abortion.
Please talk about how you came to that decision.


1222
1:13:7,739 --> 1:13:13,449
Talk about how your religion played a part
in that. And please, this is such an emotional


1223
1:13:13,449 --> 1:13:14,469
issue for so many --


1224
1:13:14,469 --> 1:13:15,9
REP. RYAN: Sure.


1225
1:13:15,9 --> 1:13:20,989
MS. RADDATZ: -- people in this country. Please
talk personally about this if you could. Congressman


1226
1:13:20,989 --> 1:13:22,11
Ryan.


1227
1:13:22,11 --> 1:13:27,28
REP. RYAN: I don’t see how a person can
separate their public life from their private


1228
1:13:27,28 --> 1:13:33,62
life or from their faith. Our faith informs
us in everything we do. My faith informs me


1229
1:13:33,62 --> 1:13:38,38
about how to take care of the vulnerable,
about how to make sure that people have a


1230
1:13:38,38 --> 1:13:40,1
chance in life.


1231
1:13:40,1 --> 1:13:47,5
Now, you want to ask basically why I’m pro-life?
It’s not simply because of my Catholic faith.


1232
1:13:47,5 --> 1:13:53,67
That’s a factor, of course, but it’s also
because of reason and science. You know, I


1233
1:13:53,67 --> 1:14:0,719
think about 10 1/2 years ago, my wife Janna
and I went to Mercy Hospital in Janesville


1234
1:14:0,719 --> 1:14:8,719
where I was born for our seven-week ultrasound
for our firstborn child, and we saw that heartbeat.


1235
1:14:8,719 --> 1:14:16,5
Our little baby was in the shape of a bean,
and to this day, we have nicknamed our firstborn


1236
1:14:16,5 --> 1:14:18,64
child, Liza, “Bean.” (Chuckles.)


1237
1:14:18,64 --> 1:14:22,449
Now, I believe that life begins at conception.


1238
1:14:22,449 --> 1:14:25,81
That’s why -- those are the reasons why
I’m pro-life.


1239
1:14:25,81 --> 1:14:30,55
Now, I understand this is a difficult issue.
And I respect people who don’t agree with


1240
1:14:30,55 --> 1:14:38,21
me on this. But the policy of a Romney administration
will be to oppose abortion with the exceptions


1241
1:14:38,21 --> 1:14:41,36
for rape, incest and life of the mother.


1242
1:14:41,36 --> 1:14:48,2
What troubles me more is how this administration
has handled all of these issues. Look at what


1243
1:14:48,2 --> 1:14:52,36
they’re doing through “Obamacare” with
respect to assaulting the religious liberties


1244
1:14:52,36 --> 1:15:0,0
of this country. They’re infringing upon
our first freedom, the freedom of religion,


1245
1:15:0,0 --> 1:15:4,79
by infringing on Catholic charities, Catholic
churches, Catholic hospitals. Our church should


1246
1:15:4,79 --> 1:15:8,86
not have to sue our federal government to
maintain their religious -- religious liberties.


1247
1:15:8,86 --> 1:15:13,46
And with respect to abortion, the Democratic
Party used to say they want it to be safe,


1248
1:15:13,46 --> 1:15:19,12
legal and rare. Now they support it without
restriction and with taxpayer funding, taxpayer


1249
1:15:19,12 --> 1:15:23,42
funding in “Obamacare,” taxpayer funding
with foreign aid. The vice president himself


1250
1:15:23,42 --> 1:15:29,36
went to China and said that he sympathized
or wouldn’t second- guess their one-child


1251
1:15:29,36 --> 1:15:34,0
policy of forced abortions and sterilizations.
That, to me, is pretty extreme.


1252
1:15:34,0 --> 1:15:36,19
MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden.


1253
1:15:36,19 --> 1:15:44,86
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: My religion defines
who I am. And I’ve been a practicing Catholic


1254
1:15:44,86 --> 1:15:52,13
my whole life. And it has particularly informed
my social doctrine. Catholic social doctrine


1255
1:15:52,13 --> 1:15:58,12
talks about taking care of those who -- who
can’t take care of themselves, people who


1256
1:15:58,12 --> 1:16:0,739
need help.


1257
1:16:0,739 --> 1:16:8,52
With regard to -- with regard to abortion,
I accept my church’s position on abortion


1258
1:16:8,52 --> 1:16:14,3
as a -- what we call de fide (doctrine ?). Life
begins at conception. That’s the church’s


1259
1:16:14,3 --> 1:16:16,26
judgment. I accept it in my personal life.


1260
1:16:16,26 --> 1:16:23,23
But I refuse to impose it on equally devout
Christians and Muslims and Jews and -- I just


1261
1:16:23,23 --> 1:16:28,57
refuse to impose that on others, unlike my
friend here, the congressman.


1262
1:16:28,57 --> 1:16:36,75
I -- I do not believe that -- that we have
a right to tell other people that women, they


1263
1:16:36,75 --> 1:16:40,77
-- they can’t control their body. It’s
a decision between them and their doctor,


1264
1:16:40,77 --> 1:16:45,55
in my view. And the Supreme Court -- I’m
not going to interfere with that.


1265
1:16:45,55 --> 1:16:51,67
With regard to the assault on the Catholic
Church, let me make it absolutely clear. No


1266
1:16:51,67 --> 1:16:57,5
religious institution, Catholic or otherwise,
including Catholic Social Services, Georgetown


1267
1:16:57,5 --> 1:17:4,55
Hospital, Mercy -- any hospital -- none has
to either refer contraception. None has to


1268
1:17:4,55 --> 1:17:11,13
pay for contraception. None has to be a vehicle
to get contraception in any insurance policy


1269
1:17:11,13 --> 1:17:15,54
they provide. That is a fact. That is a fact.


1270
1:17:15,54 --> 1:17:26,0
Now, with regard to the way in which the -- we
differ, my friend says that he -- well, I


1271
1:17:26,0 --> 1:17:32,23
guess he accepts Governor Romney’s position
now, because in the past he has argued that


1272
1:17:32,23 --> 1:17:36,73
there was -- there’s rape and forcible rape.
He’s argued that, in the case of rape or


1273
1:17:36,73 --> 1:17:43,25
incest, it was still -- it would be a crime
to engage in having an abortion. I just fundamentally


1274
1:17:43,25 --> 1:17:44,68
disagree with my friend.


1275
1:17:44,68 --> 1:17:45,969
MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan.


1276
1:17:45,969 --> 1:17:51,489
REP. RYAN: All I’m saying is if you believe
that life begins at conception, that therefore


1277
1:17:51,489 --> 1:17:57,44
doesn’t change the definition of life. That’s
a principle. The policy of a Romney administration


1278
1:17:57,44 --> 1:18:3,989
is to oppose abortion with exceptions for
rape, incest and life of the mother. Now,


1279
1:18:3,989 --> 1:18:7,3
I’ve got to take issue with the Catholic
Church and religious liberty.


1280
1:18:7,3 --> 1:18:7,8
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: You have, on the issue
of Catholic social doctrine, taken issue.


1281
1:18:7,8 --> 1:18:11,3
REP. RYAN: If they -- if they agree with you,
then why would they keep -- why would they


1282
1:18:11,3 --> 1:18:13,94
keep suing you? It’s a distinction without
a difference.


1283
1:18:13,94 --> 1:18:14,42
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.)


1284
1:18:14,42 --> 1:18:19,75
MS. RADDATZ: I want to go back to the abortion
question here. If the Romney-Ryan ticket is


1285
1:18:19,75 --> 1:18:24,9
elected, should those who believe that abortion
should remain legal be worried?


1286
1:18:24,9 --> 1:18:31,77
REP. RYAN: We don’t think that unelected
judges should make this decision; that people,


1287
1:18:31,77 --> 1:18:35,73
through their elected representatives and
reaching a consensus in society through the


1288
1:18:35,73 --> 1:18:38,38
democratic process, should make this determination.


1289
1:18:38,38 --> 1:18:43,71
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: The court -- the next
president will get one or two Supreme Court


1290
1:18:43,71 --> 1:18:49,699
nominees. That’s how close Roe v. Wade is.


1291
1:18:49,699 --> 1:18:56,9
Just ask yourself: With Robert Bork being
the chief adviser on the court for -- for


1292
1:18:56,9 --> 1:19:0,61
Mr. Romney, who do you think he’s likely
to appoint? Do you think he’s likely to


1293
1:19:0,61 --> 1:19:8,39
appoint someone like Scalia or someone else
on the court, far right, that would outlaw


1294
1:19:8,39 --> 1:19:11,81
Planned -- excuse me -- outlaw abortion? I
suspect that would happen.


1295
1:19:11,81 --> 1:19:17,969
I guarantee you that will not happen. We picked
two people. We picked people who are open-minded.


1296
1:19:17,969 --> 1:19:21,29
They’ve been good justices. So keep an eye
on the Supreme Court --


1297
1:19:21,29 --> 1:19:22,18
REP. RYAN: Was there a litmus test on them?


1298
1:19:22,18 --> 1:19:25,96
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: There was no litmus
test. We picked people who had an open mind,


1299
1:19:25,96 --> 1:19:27,86
did not come with an agenda.


1300
1:19:27,86 --> 1:19:31,989
MS. RADDATZ: I’m going to move on to this
closing question because we are running out


1301
1:19:31,989 --> 1:19:32,82
of time.


1302
1:19:32,82 --> 1:19:36,96
It’s certainly known -- you’ve said it
here tonight -- that the two of you respect


1303
1:19:36,96 --> 1:19:43,15
our troops enormously. Your son has served,
and perhaps someday your children will serve


1304
1:19:43,15 --> 1:19:44,16
as well.


1305
1:19:44,16 --> 1:19:50,46
I recently spoke to a highly decorated soldier
who said that this presidential campaign has


1306
1:19:50,46 --> 1:19:55,69
left him dismayed. He told me, quote, “The
ads are so negative and they are all tearing


1307
1:19:55,69 --> 1:19:59,0
down each other, rather than building up the
country.”


1308
1:19:59,0 --> 1:20:4,4
What would you say to that American hero about
this campaign? And at the end of the day,


1309
1:20:4,4 --> 1:20:9,15
are you ever embarrassed by the tone?


1310
1:20:9,15 --> 1:20:10,11
Vice President Biden.


1311
1:20:10,11 --> 1:20:15,3
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I would say to him the
same thing I say to my son, who did serve


1312
1:20:15,3 --> 1:20:23,21
year in Iraq: that we only have one truly
sacred obligation as a government. That’s


1313
1:20:23,21 --> 1:20:27,53
to equip those we send into harm’s way and
care for those who come home.


1314
1:20:27,53 --> 1:20:33,84
That’s the only sacred obligation we have.
Everything else falls behind that.


1315
1:20:33,84 --> 1:20:43,55
I would also tell him that the fact that he,
this decorated soldier you talked about, fought


1316
1:20:43,55 --> 1:20:49,469
for his country -- that that should be honored.
He should not be thrown into a category of


1317
1:20:49,469 --> 1:20:54,54
the 47 percent who don’t pay their taxes
while he was out there fighting and not having


1318
1:20:54,54 --> 1:20:58,38
to pay taxes and somehow not taking responsibility.


1319
1:20:58,38 --> 1:21:3,25
I would also tell him that there are things
that have occurred in this campaign and occur


1320
1:21:3,25 --> 1:21:8,36
in every campaign that I’m sure both of
us regret anyone having said, particularly


1321
1:21:8,36 --> 1:21:14,44
in these special new groups that can go out
there, raise all the money they want, not


1322
1:21:14,44 --> 1:21:19,679
have to identify themselves and say the most
scurrilous things about the other candidate.


1323
1:21:19,679 --> 1:21:21,71
It’s -- it’s -- it’s an abomination.


1324
1:21:21,71 --> 1:21:27,88
But the bottom line here is I’d ask that
hero you reference to take a look at whether


1325
1:21:27,88 --> 1:21:35,73
or not Governor Romney or President Obama
has the conviction to help lift up the middle


1326
1:21:35,73 --> 1:21:40,9
class, restore them to where they were before
this Great Recession hit and they got wiped


1327
1:21:40,9 --> 1:21:46,71
out or whether or not he’s going to continue
to focus on taking care of only the very wealthy,


1328
1:21:46,71 --> 1:21:51,46
not asking them to make -- pay any part of
the deal to bring the -- bring back the middle


1329
1:21:51,46 --> 1:21:52,92
class, the economy of this country.


1330
1:21:52,92 --> 1:21:58,9
I would ask him to take a look at whether
the president of the United States has acted


1331
1:21:58,9 --> 1:22:3,15
wisely in the use of force and whether or
not the slipshod comments being made by my


1332
1:22:3,15 --> 1:22:11,36
-- my friend or by Governor Romney serve -- serve
our interests very well. But there are things


1333
1:22:11,36 --> 1:22:16,46
that have been said in campaigns that I -- I
find not very appealing.


1334
1:22:16,46 --> 1:22:17,33
MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan.


1335
1:22:17,33 --> 1:22:20,84
REP. RYAN: First of all, I’d thank him to
his service to our country.


1336
1:22:20,84 --> 1:22:24,94
Second of all, I’d say, we are not going
to impose these devastating cuts on our military


1337
1:22:24,94 --> 1:22:27,53
which compromises their mission and their
safety.


1338
1:22:27,53 --> 1:22:33,5
And then I would say, you have a president
who ran for president four years ago promising


1339
1:22:33,5 --> 1:22:40,92
hope and change who has now turned his campaign
into attack, blame and defame. You see, if


1340
1:22:40,92 --> 1:22:45,679
you don’t have a good record to run on,
then you paint your opponent as someone to


1341
1:22:45,679 --> 1:22:52,11
run from. That was what President Obama said
in 2008. It’s what he’s doing right now.


1342
1:22:52,11 --> 1:22:55,949
Look at all the string of broken promises.
If you like your health care plan you can


1343
1:22:55,949 --> 1:23:0,75
keep it -- try telling that to the 20 million
people who are projected to lose their health


1344
1:23:0,75 --> 1:23:4,35
insurance if “Obamacare” goes through
or the seven point million -- 7.4 million


1345
1:23:4,35 --> 1:23:5,98
seniors who are going to lose it.


1346
1:23:5,98 --> 1:23:11,0
Or remember when he said this: I guarantee
if you make less than $250,000, your taxes


1347
1:23:11,0 --> 1:23:15,33
won’t go up. Of the 21 tax increases in
“Obamacare,” 12 of them hit the middle


1348
1:23:15,33 --> 1:23:16,66
class.


1349
1:23:16,66 --> 1:23:20,98
Or remember when he said, health insurance
premiums will go down, and $2,500 per family


1350
1:23:20,98 --> 1:23:24,64
per year? They’ve gone up 3,000 (dollars),
and they’re expected to go up another 2,400


1351
1:23:24,64 --> 1:23:25,15
(dollars).


1352
1:23:25,15 --> 1:23:29,12
Or remember when he said, I promise by the
end of my first term, I’ll cut the deficit


1353
1:23:29,12 --> 1:23:37,7
in half in four years? We’ve had four budgets,
four trillion-dollar deficits. A debt crisis


1354
1:23:37,7 --> 1:23:42,26
is coming. We can’t keep spending and borrowing
like this. We can’t just keep spending money


1355
1:23:42,26 --> 1:23:44,76
we don’t have.


1356
1:23:44,76 --> 1:23:50,87
Leaders run to problems to fix problems. President
Obama has not even put a credible plan on


1357
1:23:50,87 --> 1:23:55,0
the table in any -- any of his four years
to deal with this debt crisis. I passed two


1358
1:23:55,0 --> 1:23:59,71
budgets to deal with this. Mitt Romney’s
put ideas on the table. We’ve got to tackle


1359
1:23:59,71 --> 1:24:1,78
this debt crisis before it tackles us.


1360
1:24:1,78 --> 1:24:6,37
The president likes to say he has a plan.
He gave a speech. We asked his budget office,


1361
1:24:6,37 --> 1:24:10,3
can we see the plan? They sent us to this
press secretary. He gave us a copy of the


1362
1:24:10,3 --> 1:24:13,41
speech. We asked the Congressional Budget
Office, tell us what President Obama’s plan


1363
1:24:13,41 --> 1:24:17,94
is to prevent a debt crisis. They said, it’s
a speech; we can’t estimate speeches. You


1364
1:24:17,94 --> 1:24:23,75
see? That’s what we get in this administration:
speeches. But we’re not getting leadership.


1365
1:24:23,75 --> 1:24:30,429
Mitt Romney is uniquely qualified to fix these
problems. His lifetime of experience, his


1366
1:24:30,429 --> 1:24:34,42
proven track record of bipartisanship -- and
what do we have from the president? He broke


1367
1:24:34,42 --> 1:24:38,31
his big promise to bring people together to
solve the country’s biggest problems. And


1368
1:24:38,31 --> 1:24:40,55
what I would tell him is we don’t have to
settle for this.


1369
1:24:40,55 --> 1:24:40,929
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Inaudible.)


1370
1:24:40,929 --> 1:24:41,32
MS. RADDATZ: I -- I --


1371
1:24:41,32 --> 1:24:42,39
REP. RYAN: We can do better than this.


1372
1:24:42,39 --> 1:24:43,64
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I hope I’ll get equal
time.


1373
1:24:43,64 --> 1:24:48,34
MS. RADDATZ: I -- you will get just a few
minutes here, a few seconds, really.


1374
1:24:48,34 --> 1:24:53,78
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: The two budgets the
congressman introduced have eviscerated all


1375
1:24:53,78 --> 1:24:58,88
the things that the middle class cares about.
It has knocked 19 -- it will knock 19 million


1376
1:24:58,88 --> 1:25:5,36
people off of Medicare. It will kick 200,000
children off of early education. It will eliminate


1377
1:25:5,36 --> 1:25:10,48
the tax credit people have to be able to send
their children to college. It cuts education


1378
1:25:10,48 --> 1:25:18,71
by $450 billion. It -- it -- it does -- it
does virtually nothing, except continue to


1379
1:25:18,71 --> 1:25:20,87
increase the tax cuts for the very wealthy.


1380
1:25:20,87 --> 1:25:26,15
And, you know, we’ve had enough of this.
My -- the idea that these -- so concerned


1381
1:25:26,15 --> 1:25:30,69
about these deficits, I pointed out, he voted
to put two wars on a credit card. He did --


1382
1:25:30,69 --> 1:25:31,86
MS. RADDATZ: We’re -- we’re going to --


1383
1:25:31,86 --> 1:25:32,3
REP. RYAN: He voted --


1384
1:25:32,3 --> 1:25:33,59
MS. RADDATZ: We’re going to the closing
statements in a minute.


1385
1:25:33,59 --> 1:25:33,98
REP. RYAN: But let me -- just a second --


1386
1:25:33,98 --> 1:25:35,17
MS. RADDATZ: I -- you’re going to have your
closing --


1387
1:25:35,17 --> 1:25:38,98
REP. RYAN: Not raising taxes is not cutting
taxes. And by the way, our budget --


1388
1:25:38,98 --> 1:25:39,969
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: We have not raised --


1389
1:25:39,969 --> 1:25:43,3
REP. RYAN: -- we increased spending by 3 percent
a year instead of 4 1/2 percent like they


1390
1:25:43,3 --> 1:25:43,67
proposed.


1391
1:25:43,67 --> 1:25:45,13
MS. RADDATZ: Let me -- let me calm down things
here --


1392
1:25:45,13 --> 1:25:46,85
REP. RYAN: So not spending more money as much
as they say is not a spending cut.


1393
1:25:46,85 --> 1:25:50,32
MS. RADDATZ: -- just for a minute. And I want
to talk to you very briefly before we go to


1394
1:25:50,32 --> 1:25:55,86
closing statements about your own personal
character. If you are elected, what could


1395
1:25:55,86 --> 1:26:1,53
you both give to this country as a man, as
a human being that no one else could?


1396
1:26:1,53 --> 1:26:6,84
REP. RYAN: Honesty. No one else could? There
are plenty of fine people who could lead this


1397
1:26:6,84 --> 1:26:11,64
country. But what you need are people who,
when they say they’re going to do something,


1398
1:26:11,64 --> 1:26:17,54
they go do it. What you need are when people
see problems, they offer solutions to fix


1399
1:26:17,54 --> 1:26:20,16
those problems. We’re not getting that.


1400
1:26:20,16 --> 1:26:24,7
Look, we can grow this economy faster. That’s
what our five-point plan for a stronger middle


1401
1:26:24,7 --> 1:26:27,36
class is all about. It’s about getting 12
million jobs, higher take-home pay; getting


1402
1:26:27,36 --> 1:26:32,949
people out of poverty, into the middle class.
That means going with proven pro-growth policies


1403
1:26:32,949 --> 1:26:38,11
that we know work to get people back to work,
putting ideas on the table, working with Democrats


1404
1:26:38,11 --> 1:26:40,69
-- that actually works sometimes -- and then
getting things done.


1405
1:26:40,69 --> 1:26:43,8
MS. RADDATZ: Vice President, could we get
to that -- to that issue of what you could


1406
1:26:43,8 --> 1:26:47,679
bring as a man, a human being? And I really
am going to keep you to about 15 seconds here.


1407
1:26:47,679 --> 1:26:49,61
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, he gets 40, I
get 15, but that’s OK. That’s all right.


1408
1:26:49,61 --> 1:26:51,11
MS. RADDATZ: He didn’t have 40. He didn’t
have 40.


1409
1:26:51,11 --> 1:26:56,4
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Now, let me tell you,
I -- my -- my record stands for itself. I


1410
1:26:56,4 --> 1:27:3,23
never say anything I don’t mean. Everybody
knows whatever I say, I do. And my whole life


1411
1:27:3,23 --> 1:27:7,8
has been devoted to leveling the playing field
for middle-class people, giving them an even


1412
1:27:7,8 --> 1:27:11,73
break, treating Main Street and Wall Street
the same, holding the same responsibility.


1413
1:27:11,73 --> 1:27:16,84
Look at my record. It’s been all about the
middle class. They’re the people who grow


1414
1:27:16,84 --> 1:27:21,2
this country. We think you grow this country
from the middle out, not from the top down.


1415
1:27:21,2 --> 1:27:25,92
MS. RADDATZ: OK. We now turn to the candidates
for their closing statements. Thank you, gentlemen.


1416
1:27:25,92 --> 1:27:30,14
And that coin toss, again, has Vice President
Biden starting with a closing statement.


1417
1:27:30,14 --> 1:27:34,16
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, let -- let -- let
me say at the outset that I want to thank


1418
1:27:34,16 --> 1:27:42,9
you, Martha, for doing this, and Centre College.
The fact is that we’re in a situation where


1419
1:27:42,9 --> 1:27:50,26
we inherited a god-awful circumstance. People
are in real trouble. We acted to move to bring


1420
1:27:50,26 --> 1:27:53,67
relief to the people who need the most help
now.


1421
1:27:53,67 --> 1:27:58,6
And -- and in the process, we -- in case you
haven’t noticed, we have strong disagreements.


1422
1:27:58,6 --> 1:28:5,65
But I -- you probably detected my frustration
with their attitude about the -- the American


1423
1:28:5,65 --> 1:28:11,58
people. My friend says that 30 percent of
the American people are takers. They -- Romney


1424
1:28:11,58 --> 1:28:15,9
points out, 47 percent of the people won’t
take responsibility. He’s talking about


1425
1:28:15,9 --> 1:28:20,8
my mother and father. And he’s talking about
the places I grew up in, my neighbors in Scranton


1426
1:28:20,8 --> 1:28:21,16
and Claymont.


1427
1:28:21,16 --> 1:28:25,59
He’s talking about -- he’s talking about
the people that have built this country. All


1428
1:28:25,59 --> 1:28:29,42
they’re looking for, Martha -- all they’re
looking for is an even shot. When they’ve


1429
1:28:29,42 --> 1:28:34,199
been given the shot, they’ve done it. They’ve
done it. Whenever you level the playing field,


1430
1:28:34,199 --> 1:28:34,83
they’ve been able to move.


1431
1:28:34,83 --> 1:28:39,94
And they want a little bit of peace of mind.
And the president and I are not going to rest


1432
1:28:39,94 --> 1:28:45,429
until that playing field is leveled, they
in fact have a clear shot and they have peace


1433
1:28:45,429 --> 1:28:49,9
of mind, until they can turn to their kid
and say with a degree of confidence, honey,


1434
1:28:49,9 --> 1:28:55,41
it’s going to be OK. It’s going to be
OK. That’s what this is all about.


1435
1:28:55,41 --> 1:28:57,11
MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan.


1436
1:28:57,11 --> 1:29:2,1
REP. RYAN: I want to thank you as well, Martha,
Danville, Kentucky, Centre College.


1437
1:29:2,1 --> 1:29:7,75
And I want to thank you, Joe. It’s been
an honor to engage in this critical debate.


1438
1:29:7,75 --> 1:29:15,19
We face a very big choice. What kind of country
are we going to be? What kind of country are


1439
1:29:15,19 --> 1:29:21,87
we going to give our kids? President Obama
-- he had his chance. He made his choices.


1440
1:29:21,87 --> 1:29:26,87
His economic agenda, more spending, more borrowing,
higher taxes, a government takeover of health


1441
1:29:26,87 --> 1:29:33,15
care -- it’s not working. It’s failed
to create the jobs we need. Twenty-three million


1442
1:29:33,15 --> 1:29:39,35
Americans are struggling for work today. Fifteen
percent of Americans are in poverty.


1443
1:29:39,35 --> 1:29:45,54
This is not what a real recovery looks like.
You deserve better. Mitt Romney and I want


1444
1:29:45,54 --> 1:29:53,48
to earn your support. We’re offering real
reforms for a real recovery for every American.


1445
1:29:53,48 --> 1:30:1,6
Mitt Romney, his experience, his ideas, his
solutions, is uniquely qualified to get this


1446
1:30:1,6 --> 1:30:5,1
job done. At a time when we have a jobs crisis
in America, wouldn’t it be nice to have


1447
1:30:5,1 --> 1:30:7,55
a job creator in the White House?


1448
1:30:7,55 --> 1:30:15,3
The choice is clear: a stagnant economy that
promotes more government dependency, or a


1449
1:30:15,3 --> 1:30:20,94
dynamic, growing economy that promotes opportunity
and jobs. Mitt Romney and I will not duck


1450
1:30:20,94 --> 1:30:23,9
the tough issues.


1451
1:30:23,9 --> 1:30:32,219
We will take responsibility. And we will not
try to replace our founding principles; we


1452
1:30:32,219 --> 1:30:38,3
will reapply our founding principles. The
choice is clear, and the choice rests with


1453
1:30:38,3 --> 1:30:41,92
you, and we ask you for your vote. Thank you.


1454
1:30:41,92 --> 1:30:44,88
MS. RADDATZ: And thank you both again. Thank
you very much.


1455
1:30:44,88 --> 1:30:45,32
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Thank you.


1456
1:30:45,32 --> 1:30:49,89
MS. RADDATZ: This concludes the vice presidential
debate. Please tune in next Tuesday for the


1457
1:30:49,89 --> 1:30:53,66
second presidential debate at Hofstra University
in New York.


1458
1:30:53,66 --> 1:30:59,1
I’m Martha Raddatz of ABC News. I do hope
all of you go to the polls. Have a good evening.


1459
1:30:59,1 --> 1:30:59,12
(Applause.)


1460
1:30:59,12 --> 1:32:59,12
