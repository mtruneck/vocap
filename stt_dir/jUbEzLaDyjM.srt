1
0:0:2,5 --> 0:0:10,799
The following program is brought
to you in living colour on NBC.


2
0:0:10,799 --> 0:0:14,318
Captain's log, Stardate 6010.1


3
0:0:14,318 --> 0:0:16,193
While in the midst of a ship wide systems upgrade


4
0:0:16,193 --> 0:0:39,569
The Enterprise has been ordered to depart star
base 37, in response to a nearby distress call.


5
0:0:39,569 --> 0:0:44,27
While there, I had the dubious honour of greeting
the new admiral assigned to this sector.


6
0:0:44,27 --> 0:0:47,293
Our time together, fortunately, was brief.


7
0:0:47,293 --> 0:0:49,404
At last, we were underway.


8
0:0:49,404 --> 0:0:52,63
Although I have mixed feelings knowing
we are more than half way through


9
0:0:52,63 --> 0:0:54,253
our five-year mission.


10
0:0:54,253 --> 0:0:56,779
With Sulu at Starfleet for command training,


11
0:0:56,779 --> 0:0:59,236
the promotion of Mr Chekov to head of security,


12
0:0:59,236 --> 0:1:2,41
and the return of my former yeoman
as a newly commissioned officer,


13
0:1:2,41 --> 0:1:7,645
it seems the more things change,
the more they stay the same.


14
0:1:7,645 --> 0:1:10,414
Uhura, have you made any
contact with the colony?


15
0:1:10,414 --> 0:1:13,853
Negative Captain, I am no longer
receiving the distress signal.


16
0:1:13,853 --> 0:1:17,154
There is an unusual amount of
interference on subspace.


17
0:1:17,154 --> 0:1:20,698
- Captain, you wanted to know...
- Not now Rand. Mr Spock, any readings?


18
0:1:20,698 --> 0:1:23,794
Nothing yet, sir.
We are still too far out.


19
0:1:23,794 --> 0:1:29,3
- Mr DeSalle, what's our ETA?
- 17 minutes to orbit, sir.


20
0:1:29,3 --> 0:1:32,345
- Mr Scott?
- Aye sir, I can give you more.


21
0:1:32,345 --> 0:1:35,58
- Increase speed to Warp 7.
- Aye, sir.


22
0:1:35,58 --> 0:1:37,878
Captain, long-range scans available now.


23
0:1:37,878 --> 0:1:41,952
Sensors indicate massive energy discharges.


24
0:1:41,952 --> 0:1:43,415
The readings are off the scale.


25
0:1:43,415 --> 0:1:46,619
DeSalle, go to maximum Warp.
Lt Uhura, sound red alert.


26
0:1:46,619 --> 0:1:49,38
Chekov, bring phasers and
photon torpedoes online.


27
0:1:49,38 --> 0:1:51,589
Phasers and photon torpedoes
armed and ready, Captain.


28
0:1:51,589 --> 0:1:52,957
Anything, Spock?


29
0:1:52,957 --> 0:1:57,296
I am at a loss to explain, Captain.
Sensors reveal two alien vessels,


30
0:1:57,296 --> 0:1:59,13
then they simply vanished.


31
0:1:59,13 --> 0:2:1,901
Two vessels?
Could they have been working together?


32
0:2:1,901 --> 0:2:5,7
- Unknown.
- Uhura, anything from the colony?


33
0:2:5,7 --> 0:2:7,199
Subspace channels are clearing.


34
0:2:7,199 --> 0:2:10,66
I am receiving a transmission
from the colony, now


35
0:2:10,66 --> 0:2:13,177
- On screen, Lieutenant.
- Aye sir.


36
0:2:13,177 --> 0:2:16,148
This is Captain James T. Kirk
of the starship Enterprise.


37
0:2:16,148 --> 0:2:18,422
Are you in need of assistance?


38
0:2:18,422 --> 0:2:23,532
I'm Cal Strickland, director of this
research colony, here on Primus IV.


39
0:2:23,532 --> 0:2:27,238
You sure took your sweet time,
responding to our emergency.


40
0:2:27,238 --> 0:2:31,294
Well we're here now.
What's the nature of your distress call?


41
0:2:31,294 --> 0:2:34,319
We have the situation under control
now, no thanks to you.


42
0:2:34,319 --> 0:2:38,137
We assumed this outpost was
to be under your protection.


43
0:2:38,137 --> 0:2:42,78
Director, it is.
Now what exactly happened here?


44
0:2:42,78 --> 0:2:47,68
A short time ago, a large object appears
in orbit, randomly firing at the planet.


45
0:2:47,68 --> 0:2:50,666
All attempts at communication
were unsuccessful.


46
0:2:50,666 --> 0:2:53,855
Director Strickland, could we please
review your sensor data,


47
0:2:53,855 --> 0:2:55,983
as it may contain additional information.


48
0:2:55,983 --> 0:3:1,2
I'll transmit what we have.
Of course, by now we are not


49
0:3:1,2 --> 0:3:4,764
too concerned by a return visit by
this intruder, thanks to the Onabi.


50
0:3:4,764 --> 0:3:6,297
The what?


51
0:3:6,297 --> 0:3:10,569
The Onabi. At least that's
the name we were given.


52
0:3:10,569 --> 0:3:14,772
As soon as the Onabi appeared,
this intruder fled.


53
0:3:14,772 --> 0:3:17,73
I'll have my chief medical officer
coordinate with your people


54
0:3:17,73 --> 0:3:21,606
and beam down anything you might need.
In the meantime, we will remain here in orbit,


55
0:3:21,606 --> 0:3:23,914
in case there is any more trouble.


56
0:3:23,914 --> 0:3:29,168
Don't worry, Kirk. Fortunately, as long as we
have the Onabi patrolling this sector.


57
0:3:29,168 --> 0:3:34,374
we feel reasonably sure that we
won't be calling on you anytime soon.


58
0:3:34,374 --> 0:3:38,897
At least not if we need anything in a hurry!


59
0:3:38,897 --> 0:3:42,652
Mr Chekov, cancel the red alert.
Spock, analyse the sensor data.


60
0:3:42,652 --> 0:3:46,372
See if you can determine the
intruders course out of this system.


61
0:3:46,372 --> 0:3:49,74
- Rand, you take care of that.
- Yes, sir.


62
0:3:49,74 --> 0:3:59,426
In the meantime, I will be in
my quarters with a headache.


63
0:3:59,426 --> 0:4:11,477
Here we go again.


64
0:4:11,477 --> 0:4:16,593
Space, the final frontier.


65
0:4:16,593 --> 0:4:20,939
These are the new voyages of
the Starship Enterprise.


66
0:4:20,939 --> 0:4:24,902
Its five-year mission, to explore strange new worlds.


67
0:4:24,902 --> 0:4:28,983
To seek out new life and new civilizations.


68
0:4:28,983 --> 0:5:31,909
To boldly go where no man has gone before.


69
0:5:31,909 --> 0:5:35,3
Captain's Log, stardate 6011.2.


70
0:5:35,3 --> 0:5:38,861
We are continuing our investigation
of the mysterious intruder,


71
0:5:38,861 --> 0:5:41,846
who has been attacking ships and
outposts throughout this sector.


72
0:5:41,846 --> 0:5:45,132
I am frustrated by the lack of information
we have gathered thus far.


73
0:5:45,132 --> 0:5:47,799
That, and by the fact that
there is nothing to do but


74
0:5:47,799 --> 0:5:52,561
wait for the Onabi or
the intruder to reappear.


75
0:5:52,561 --> 0:5:57,867
Captain, I do not recall previously
viewing this representation.


76
0:5:57,867 --> 0:5:59,716
What Spock?


77
0:5:59,716 --> 0:6:1,94
The musical composition you have on display.


78
0:6:1,94 --> 0:6:5,696
Oh, you mean the hymn.
That belonged to my brother Sam.


79
0:6:5,696 --> 0:6:10,585
My mother gave it to he and Aurelan
when they left for Denova.


80
0:6:10,585 --> 0:6:11,858
What is it Spock?


81
0:6:11,858 --> 0:6:14,423
I do not understand the words.


82
0:6:14,423 --> 0:6:19,287
'Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me?'


83
0:6:19,287 --> 0:6:26,922
'I once was lost but now I'm found,
was blind but now I see. '


84
0:6:26,922 --> 0:6:30,888
Well Spock, it is about us. It is about
what we are supposedly doing out here.


85
0:6:30,888 --> 0:6:34,22
Extending compassion to those
in need, saving the lost.


86
0:6:34,22 --> 0:6:39,26
Helping those people who can't help themselves
and asking nothing in return.


87
0:6:39,26 --> 0:6:41,69
But, the song would seem
to indicate a deity.


88
0:6:41,69 --> 0:6:43,771
Were not the religious
conflicts of your world,


89
0:6:43,771 --> 0:6:45,82
what led your species to
the brink of destruction?


90
0:6:45,82 --> 0:6:50,735
- Yes, but it is the ideal that survives.
- Then the hymn is still relevant.


91
0:6:50,735 --> 0:6:54,434
I shall endeavour to study it further.


92
0:6:54,434 --> 0:7:0,337
- Your move, Captain.
- Come.


93
0:7:0,337 --> 0:7:6,723
- Beware Romulans bearing gifts.
- Why Bones? Romulan Ale!


94
0:7:6,723 --> 0:7:10,224
You are aware, doctor, that Romulan ale
is illegal in federation space?


95
0:7:10,224 --> 0:7:14,82
I only use it for medicinal purposes.
Now this looks familiar.


96
0:7:14,82 --> 0:7:16,841
I will have in check-mate
with his next move.


97
0:7:16,841 --> 0:7:20,4
Spock, you play the most irritating
game of chess in the galaxy.


98
0:7:20,4 --> 0:7:24,587
Irritating, doctor?


99
0:7:24,587 --> 0:7:32,563
Check-mate.


100
0:7:32,563 --> 0:7:35,332
Sure you don't know what irritating is?


101
0:7:35,332 --> 0:7:38,257
The fact that my father
married a human female...


102
0:7:38,257 --> 0:7:46,814
- It's terrible having bad blood like that..
- He may learn to enjoy it, some day.


103
0:7:46,814 --> 0:7:50,76
- Kirk here. Go ahead, Lieutenant.
- Captain, receiving a message


104
0:7:50,76 --> 0:7:52,976
from Starbase 37. It's Admiral Leslie.


105
0:7:52,976 --> 0:7:56,608
Admiral Leslie. Any relation to our Mr Leslie?


106
0:7:56,608 --> 0:8:0,17
- It's his father.
- He has got to be adopted!


107
0:8:0,17 --> 0:8:3,65
- Highly unlikely, doctor.
- Go ahead Lt, put him through.


108
0:8:3,65 --> 0:8:7,74
Admiral. To what do I owe this pleasure?


109
0:8:7,74 --> 0:8:11,216
Don't get cute, Kirk. Just what
the hell is going on out there?


110
0:8:11,216 --> 0:8:13,642
- Sir?
- I just got a transmission


111
0:8:13,642 --> 0:8:17,527
from Cal Strickland, the
director of Primus IV.


112
0:8:17,527 --> 0:8:19,905
Yes, Admiral and about that situation...


113
0:8:19,905 --> 0:8:27,444
Cal Strickland is one of the federation's
most brilliant research archaeologists.


114
0:8:27,444 --> 0:8:29,574
And he is my friend.


115
0:8:29,574 --> 0:8:35,128
Imagine the shock that I felt when the
very Starship I sent to protect him


116
0:8:35,128 --> 0:8:36,464
is nowhere in sight.


117
0:8:36,464 --> 0:8:39,15
Now you listen to me, Kirk.


118
0:8:39,15 --> 0:8:41,978
You find out who's responsible for this,
or you are going to be watching


119
0:8:41,978 --> 0:8:46,385
storage consignments of grain
for the next two years.


120
0:8:46,385 --> 0:8:49,307
Do I make myself clear, Captain?


121
0:8:49,307 --> 0:8:51,725
As clearly as can be expected...


122
0:8:51,725 --> 0:8:55,384
What was that?
Don't cross me, Kirk.


123
0:8:55,384 --> 0:8:58,903
If you think for one minute,
that you can push this admiral around


124
0:8:58,903 --> 0:9:1,12
you have got another thing comÖ


125
0:9:1,12 --> 0:9:6,212
Captain, I am receiving an urgent distress
signal from the transport tug, Al Rashid.


126
0:9:6,212 --> 0:9:8,456
They are under attack near
the Klaxor-disturbance


127
0:9:8,456 --> 0:9:11,798
by a ship matching the description
of the intruder at Primus IV.


128
0:9:11,798 --> 0:9:15,947
Go to Red-Alert. Mr Scott, divert all ship's
power to the engines. I want Warp 8.


129
0:9:15,947 --> 0:9:18,726
Lay in a direct course to the Al Rashid.
I am on my way.


130
0:9:18,726 --> 0:9:22,371
- What about the Admiral?
- I am sure he will call back.


131
0:9:22,371 --> 0:9:30,34
Red-Alert. All hands man your battle
stations. This is not a drill.


132
0:9:30,34 --> 0:9:34,807
Red-Alert. All hands man your battle
stations. This is not a drill.


133
0:9:34,807 --> 0:9:37,542
- Report.
- We are closing fast on the Al Rashid.


134
0:9:37,542 --> 0:9:40,639
- She is reporting that she is under attack.
- The Al Rashid reports a second vessel


135
0:9:40,639 --> 0:9:43,853
moving in to position.
They're challenging the intruder.


136
0:9:43,853 --> 0:9:45,555
The Onabi, I presume.


137
0:9:45,555 --> 0:9:48,559
- Are we within visual range?
- Coming in range now, sir.


138
0:9:48,559 --> 0:9:50,781
On screen. Slow to one half impulse power.


139
0:9:50,781 --> 0:9:53,9
Put us between...


140
0:9:53,9 --> 0:10:0,401
My God!


141
0:10:0,401 --> 0:10:3,396
- Sir, something is jamming the signal.
- Spock, any readings?


142
0:10:3,396 --> 0:10:5,8
The intruder vessel no longer appears on sensors.


143
0:10:5,8 --> 0:10:8,66
and the smaller ship is moving off.


144
0:10:8,66 --> 0:10:10,63
Plot an intercept course.
Try to hail them.


145
0:10:10,63 --> 0:10:12,544
There is no answer to our hails, sir.


146
0:10:12,544 --> 0:10:14,841
- She is going into Warp.
- Lock a tractor beam on to her, Scotty.


147
0:10:14,841 --> 0:10:21,48
Aye, sir.


148
0:10:21,48 --> 0:10:23,153
That's got her. She's slowing.


149
0:10:23,153 --> 0:10:25,189
Still no answer to hail, sir.


150
0:10:25,189 --> 0:10:27,548
Mr Scott, can you get a lock
on anyone on board?


151
0:10:27,548 --> 0:10:30,957
There is a lot of interference sir,
but I have got a lock on something...


152
0:10:30,957 --> 0:10:34,331
Alert the transporter room.
Mr Chekov, have a security team standing by.


153
0:10:34,331 --> 0:10:40,562
Mr Spock, you have the con.


154
0:10:40,562 --> 0:10:54,862
Transporter room, stand-by.


155
0:10:54,862 --> 0:10:57,132
- Do we still have a lock?
- Aye, sir.


156
0:10:57,132 --> 0:11:1,666
Energize.


157
0:11:1,666 --> 0:11:5,329
- Recalibrating. Stand-by.
- What's the problem?


158
0:11:5,329 --> 0:11:9,674
It's these circuits, sir. We have barely
tested the new transporters.


159
0:11:9,674 --> 0:11:12,558
These reading are like nothing
I have ever seen before.


160
0:11:12,558 --> 0:11:25,773
Remind me not to use that contraption... ever!


161
0:11:25,773 --> 0:11:31,26
- Greetings, sentient beings.
- Bones, how do you read that thing?


162
0:11:31,26 --> 0:11:33,897
Whatever it is, it doesnít
register on my tricorder.


163
0:11:33,897 --> 0:11:40,3
Please do not interrupt when I am speaking.


164
0:11:40,3 --> 0:11:45,894
Captain,...


165
0:11:45,894 --> 0:11:47,105
Thank you.


166
0:11:47,105 --> 0:11:48,426
What was that?


167
0:11:48,426 --> 0:11:51,347
As I was saying: Greetings, sentient beings.


168
0:11:51,347 --> 0:11:55,261
- I am Captain James T...
- Captain, the circuits have activated themselves.


169
0:11:55,261 --> 0:11:57,548
Someone else is beaming aboard.


170
0:11:57,548 --> 0:12:9,45
- Mr Chekov, secure the room.
- Aye, Captain.


171
0:12:9,45 --> 0:12:17,288
Oh, was I supposed to wait
until that thing was done?


172
0:12:17,288 --> 0:12:22,111
I just have no patience.
How is everything, dear?


173
0:12:22,111 --> 0:12:24,446
- I am Ohn.
- Now, Mr Chekov!


174
0:12:24,446 --> 0:12:27,542
Force-field activated, sir.


175
0:12:27,542 --> 0:12:35,785
Oh, that is so cute. Look Ohn,
a force-field. Shall we play?


176
0:12:35,785 --> 0:12:38,699
I am Onabi! You must release me!


177
0:12:38,699 --> 0:12:44,856
Mr Chekov, take our guest
to the brig to, get a grip.


178
0:12:44,856 --> 0:12:47,83
I will be there later to question her.


179
0:12:47,83 --> 0:12:51,528
The brig? Oh, I would love to go there.
Captain, this is going to be so much fun.


180
0:12:51,528 --> 0:12:59,327
Take me, my Russian!


181
0:12:59,327 --> 0:13:1,437
What the hell was that?


182
0:13:1,437 --> 0:13:6,707
Chekov, keep the force-field on that thing.


183
0:13:6,707 --> 0:13:9,636
Lt Uhura, I would like you to come
down to the transporter room


184
0:13:9,636 --> 0:13:12,254
- and have a look at our guest, Ohn.
- Aye, sir.


185
0:13:12,254 --> 0:13:30,853
- Mr Chekov, you stay here and... help.
- Aye, Captain.


186
0:13:30,853 --> 0:13:37,557
These readings are useless,
we have to lower the force-field.


187
0:13:37,557 --> 0:13:46,319
In a way, it's beautiful.


188
0:13:46,319 --> 0:13:50,758
Uhura! No!


189
0:13:50,758 --> 0:13:58,179
- ... only Vulcans, now you will die.
- Go to the side, Mr Chekov.


190
0:13:58,179 --> 0:14:7,731
And now, I will deal with you, Lieutenant.


191
0:14:7,731 --> 0:14:11,236
Scott to sick-bay. We have a medical
emergency in the transporter-room.


192
0:14:11,236 --> 0:14:19,24
Please respond immediately.


193
0:14:19,24 --> 0:14:22,202
Captain's log, stardate 6012.4.


194
0:14:22,202 --> 0:14:26,842
The Al-Rashid has received repairs and
is continuing on her resupply mission.


195
0:14:26,842 --> 0:14:30,151
We have taken Onabi into custody
and are holding her for questioning.


196
0:14:30,151 --> 0:14:33,759
Sir? I have Captain Jeffries online.


197
0:14:33,759 --> 0:14:38,98
On screen, Lieutenant.
Captain, is everything alright over there?


198
0:14:38,98 --> 0:14:42,72
What the hell was that thing, Jim?
It came at us out of nowhere.


199
0:14:42,72 --> 0:14:46,439
We're not certain. It's not the first time,
that we have heard about this intruder,


200
0:14:46,439 --> 0:14:49,56
but it was the first time
that we were able to see it.


201
0:14:49,56 --> 0:14:53,419
Now, if you hadn't shown
up when you did...


202
0:14:53,419 --> 0:14:57,663
Our sensors indicated a second ship
for a moment. Did you read that?


203
0:14:57,663 --> 0:15:0,522
We did. We were able to
bring the pilot on board and


204
0:15:0,522 --> 0:15:2,515
we think the two might be
connected in some way.


205
0:15:2,515 --> 0:15:4,294
We hope to get some answers,
to all of this, soon.


206
0:15:4,294 --> 0:15:12,688
Alright Jim. Well you take it easy out here.
That ship of yours is getting quite a reputation.


207
0:15:12,688 --> 0:15:16,18
So it would seem. Is there anything else
that we might be able to do for you?


208
0:15:16,18 --> 0:15:21,219
No, we're fine. Besides, we need to
get back to Starbase 24 as it is.


209
0:15:21,219 --> 0:15:42,473
- Safe travels, Matt.
- Same.


210
0:15:42,473 --> 0:15:44,135
How are Chekov and Uhura, Bones?


211
0:15:44,135 --> 0:15:49,152
Pretty shook-up, Jim. They described
seeing visions of the ship, the crew.


212
0:15:49,152 --> 0:15:50,969
Some pretty wild stuff.


213
0:15:50,969 --> 0:15:53,797
Whatever it was, it happened when
they came in contact with Ohn.


214
0:15:53,797 --> 0:15:57,219
A device with the ability to project
holograms and induce hallucinations


215
0:15:57,219 --> 0:15:59,12
should be considered an
extreme hazard, Captain.


216
0:15:59,12 --> 0:16:3,527
Hallucinations, maybe. But I have
got two people in sick-bay,


217
0:16:3,527 --> 0:16:5,785
who swear what they saw really happened.


218
0:16:5,785 --> 0:16:7,973
What I want to know is who this Onabi is.


219
0:16:7,973 --> 0:16:11,158
Spock, have we learned anything
from the sensor data?


220
0:16:11,158 --> 0:16:14,325
Nothing of use, Captain. The intruder ships
seem to have appeared out of nowhere.


221
0:16:14,325 --> 0:16:16,533
Could they have been
using a cloaking device?


222
0:16:16,533 --> 0:16:19,992
Unknown. It does appear, Onabi
drove the intruder ship off.


223
0:16:19,992 --> 0:16:23,361
If that's the case, she did indeed
save the colony and the Al Rashid.


224
0:16:23,361 --> 0:16:26,43
Do we have anything
definitive on this intruder?


225
0:16:26,43 --> 0:16:29,543
If our scanners are to be believed,
the size of the intruder vessel is


226
0:16:29,543 --> 0:16:32,675
- two hundred times that of our own.
- Two hundred times?


227
0:16:32,675 --> 0:16:35,636
We could quite literally beam the
Onabi Ship aboard the Enterprise.


228
0:16:35,636 --> 0:16:38,248
While the intruder could beam us into theirs.


229
0:16:38,248 --> 0:16:41,205
Nothing like being in the
middle of the food chain.


230
0:16:41,205 --> 0:16:43,866
Logically, there is another possibility, sir.


231
0:16:43,866 --> 0:16:47,501
One could assume the intruder is merely
a projection, created by our guests.


232
0:16:47,501 --> 0:16:50,701
- For what purpose?
- Perhaps to gain whatever reward is offered.


233
0:16:50,701 --> 0:16:53,419
Or, she could be trying to
destabilise the sector


234
0:16:53,419 --> 0:16:56,97
and turn the neighbouring planets
against the federation.


235
0:16:56,97 --> 0:16:58,74
Do you two just sit around all
day and make this stuff up?


236
0:16:58,74 --> 0:17:2,216
Talk about 'paranoid'. Intergalactic plot...


237
0:17:2,216 --> 0:17:5,422
Really doctor, your lack of reasoning
seems more on par with...


238
0:17:5,422 --> 0:17:8,8
Gentlemen, Gentlemen, please. We need to
start working on getting some answers.


239
0:17:8,8 --> 0:17:11,988
Then, Captain, may I request permission
to question the prisoner?


240
0:17:11,988 --> 0:17:16,908
Spock, that is one emotional woman down
there. I'd better question her, Jim.


241
0:17:16,908 --> 0:17:18,965
What she needs is some
good old southern charm.


242
0:17:18,965 --> 0:17:23,114
Doctor, your dismal record with emotional
women, has already been established.


243
0:17:23,114 --> 0:17:25,98
Why you green-blooded, inhuman son of a...


244
0:17:25,98 --> 0:17:29,134
I think perhaps both of you
should question her.


245
0:17:29,134 --> 0:17:32,264
I am sure that between the two of you,
you will discover who this intruder is


246
0:17:32,264 --> 0:17:35,584
and how Onabi managed to
drive him off three times now.


247
0:17:35,584 --> 0:17:37,9
Well?


248
0:17:37,9 --> 0:17:38,353
Aye, sir.


249
0:17:38,353 --> 0:18:1,622
Yes, sir.


250
0:18:1,622 --> 0:18:13,819
- Lower the force-field.
- Aye, sir.


251
0:18:13,819 --> 0:18:17,462
Well, Spock - Say something?


252
0:18:17,462 --> 0:18:20,174
I would say the young lady might
be getting chilled by now.


253
0:18:20,174 --> 0:18:31,466
What?


254
0:18:31,466 --> 0:18:34,731
Captain, our guest has managed to escape.


255
0:18:34,731 --> 0:18:40,232
This is the Captain: We have an intruder alert.
I repeat. All decks, intruder alert.


256
0:18:40,232 --> 0:18:41,652
Ms Rand, you have the bridge.


257
0:18:41,652 --> 0:18:42,608
Sir?


258
0:18:42,608 --> 0:18:44,358
You have had the proper training, haven't you?


259
0:18:44,358 --> 0:18:46,334
- Yes, sir.
- You are fully qualified?


260
0:18:46,334 --> 0:18:47,3
Yes, sir!


261
0:18:47,3 --> 0:18:48,982
Then I mean now, you have the bridge.


262
0:18:48,982 --> 0:18:57,2
I'll be in security.


263
0:18:57,2 --> 0:19:9,4
- Maintain position, helm.
- Aye, Captain.


264
0:19:9,4 --> 0:19:12,991
Pavel, it's good to see you
on your feet again. Report.


265
0:19:12,991 --> 0:19:17,336
Captain, all stations report secure.
There is no sign of Onabi.


266
0:19:17,336 --> 0:19:21,583
Mr Spock, take charge. When you
find her, report to me immediately.


267
0:19:21,583 --> 0:19:23,204
I'll be in my office.
- Aye, sir.


268
0:19:23,204 --> 0:19:39,12
You men check section 4. The rest
head aft. Check each room.


269
0:19:39,12 --> 0:19:42,642
What's wrong, Captain?
Am I not to your liking?


270
0:19:42,642 --> 0:20:20,462
Then perhaps something more like this...


271
0:20:20,462 --> 0:20:30,6
I am reading an unknown energy source.
From inside the Captain's office!


272
0:20:30,6 --> 0:20:35,231
Well don't just stand there Spock.
Do something.


273
0:20:35,231 --> 0:20:39,634
- Chekov!
- I'll apologize later.


274
0:20:39,634 --> 0:20:41,224
How is she, Bones?


275
0:20:41,224 --> 0:20:43,597
She'll be out for a while.


276
0:20:43,597 --> 0:20:46,575
Move her back to the brig.
Take maximum security precautions,


277
0:20:46,575 --> 0:20:48,41
and let me know when
she comes around.


278
0:20:48,41 --> 0:20:59,69
Aye, sir.


279
0:20:59,69 --> 0:21:1,879
It seems a little strange that
a phaser set on stun


280
0:21:1,879 --> 0:21:4,168
was enough to disable her
after all we've seen.


281
0:21:4,168 --> 0:21:5,712
Yeah, it does not make any sense, Jim.


282
0:21:5,712 --> 0:21:9,186
But all my readings suggest that
she is truly unconscious.


283
0:21:9,186 --> 0:21:12,626
- Perhaps it is another ruse.
- Oh, playing possum, eh Spock?


284
0:21:12,626 --> 0:21:14,946
Not an unreasonable
conclusion, doctor.


285
0:21:14,946 --> 0:21:17,631
Well I'm through playing games.
It's time we get to the bottom of all this


286
0:21:17,631 --> 0:21:24,68
before a certain Admiral has
our collective ass. Gentlemen.


287
0:21:24,68 --> 0:21:31,62
<i>Lt Arex, report to main engineering.
Ensign Capek, report to the bridge</i>


288
0:21:31,62 --> 0:21:33,721
Scotty, if you don't sit
still, I can't finish.


289
0:21:33,721 --> 0:21:36,311
Aye lass, it's fine.
It's just a wee bit sore.


290
0:21:36,311 --> 0:21:40,915
You asked me to come down here.
Now do you want me to help or not?


291
0:21:40,915 --> 0:21:47,589
Aye. Go ahead.


292
0:21:47,589 --> 0:21:48,713
There, done.


293
0:21:48,713 --> 0:21:51,696
Ah, Christine, that feels
much better. Thanks.


294
0:21:51,696 --> 0:21:54,645
Now go on and make sure,
Uhura is resting.


295
0:21:54,645 --> 0:22:4,237
Aye.


296
0:22:4,237 --> 0:22:26,2
With this ring, I thee wed.


297
0:22:26,2 --> 0:22:29,335
Captain's log, Stardate 6013.7


298
0:22:29,335 --> 0:22:33,499
There has been another incident
with the device known as Ohn.


299
0:22:33,499 --> 0:22:35,62
Just got back from sick bay.


300
0:22:35,62 --> 0:22:40,271
Christine still hasn't come around. She was
attached to that Ohn thing for a long time.


301
0:22:40,271 --> 0:22:43,166
But fortunately there doesn't appear
to be any permanent damage.


302
0:22:43,166 --> 0:22:46,596
- Well how about Uhura?
- Back on duty.


303
0:22:46,596 --> 0:22:49,21
Makes you wish we had a
ship's councillor on board!


304
0:22:49,21 --> 0:22:54,131
Captain? I'm growing rather bored in here.
Can we please move on?


305
0:22:54,131 --> 0:22:57,516
Lower the force-field.
- Ah, Captain Kirk.


306
0:22:57,516 --> 0:23:1,124
May I first apologize for my previous antics?


307
0:23:1,124 --> 0:23:2,224
I meant you no harm.


308
0:23:2,224 --> 0:23:4,602
Nor we to you.


309
0:23:4,602 --> 0:23:6,519
We simply want to learn more about you


310
0:23:6,519 --> 0:23:9,622
and about this alien intruder that
seems to be menacing this sector.


311
0:23:9,622 --> 0:23:13,981
- Yes. The Mot-nahp.
- The what?


312
0:23:13,981 --> 0:23:16,675
The Mot-nahp, Doctor.


313
0:23:16,675 --> 0:23:19,861
I most despicable menace.


314
0:23:19,861 --> 0:23:23,668
I have roamed the galaxy since
before your sun burnt hot in space.


315
0:23:23,668 --> 0:23:25,344
But soon my journey ends.


316
0:23:25,344 --> 0:23:30,51
- So you can destroy this Mot-nahp?
- Destroy? No...


317
0:23:30,51 --> 0:23:34,176
But contain the Mot-nahp, I can.
And once contained, the menace shall end.


318
0:23:34,176 --> 0:23:37,238
I must say, this all sounds rather epic.


319
0:23:37,238 --> 0:23:40,11
But there's just too many
aspects that don't add up.


320
0:23:40,11 --> 0:23:44,23
Your vessel is simply too small to
drive off an intruder of this size.


321
0:23:44,23 --> 0:23:46,541
Do not believe what only
your eyes tell you, Captain.


322
0:23:46,541 --> 0:23:50,854
I think you'll find,
not all is as it seems.


323
0:23:50,854 --> 0:23:52,526
Angles and ministers of grace...


324
0:23:52,526 --> 0:23:54,935
Scott to the Captain.


325
0:23:54,935 --> 0:23:56,295
Kirk here. Go ahead Scotty.


326
0:23:56,295 --> 0:23:58,241
We are discharging energy
into the disturbance.


327
0:23:58,241 --> 0:24:0,927
There's no reason for it, but
it's happening sure enough.


328
0:24:0,927 --> 0:24:2,535
Where's it coming from?


329
0:24:2,535 --> 0:24:5,88
Instruments read that the discharge
began near the Warp nacelles.


330
0:24:5,88 --> 0:24:9,191
I'll have to take the mains
offline to run a full diagnostic.


331
0:24:9,191 --> 0:24:11,961
Alright Scotty, I'm on my way.
- Aye, sir. - Kirk out.


332
0:24:11,961 --> 0:24:16,307
Onabi, I am going to have
to ask you to wait here.


333
0:24:16,307 --> 0:24:19,89
If you do not release me,
you will be sorry.


334
0:24:19,89 --> 0:24:33,347
The only thing he's sorry about
is pulling duty in this quadrant


335
0:24:33,347 --> 0:24:35,525
Status report, Mr Scott.


336
0:24:35,525 --> 0:24:37,44
We've had to take the mains offline.


337
0:24:37,44 --> 0:24:39,286
The ships running on battery power only.


338
0:24:39,286 --> 0:24:44,364
At our present rate of power consumption,
we can maintain shipís status for 3.24 hours.


339
0:24:44,364 --> 0:24:47,13
This should not be occurring.


340
0:24:47,13 --> 0:24:49,532
It is my theory there is
no actual power drain.


341
0:24:49,532 --> 0:24:51,899
Are you daft, man?
The indicators show otherwise.


342
0:24:51,899 --> 0:24:53,78
Would you care to elaborate, Mr Spock?


343
0:24:53,78 --> 0:24:56,494
Due to the nature of Ohn, this
could be some ploy to make us


344
0:24:56,494 --> 0:24:59,173
believe there is a power drain
when none actually exists.


345
0:24:59,173 --> 0:25:0,362
But for what purpose?


346
0:25:0,362 --> 0:25:2,991
Perhaps to give Onabi
a chance to save us.


347
0:25:2,991 --> 0:25:7,4
Mr Spock, you've been able to mind-meld
with intelligent machines before,


348
0:25:7,4 --> 0:25:9,385
Is there any chance you
can make contact with Ohn?


349
0:25:9,385 --> 0:25:12,14
Captain! Considering the effect the
contact with Ohn has had so far,


350
0:25:12,14 --> 0:25:15,113
do you think it wise to
deliberately touch that thing?


351
0:25:15,113 --> 0:25:18,634
While the risk is great, the danger Ohn
could pose to the Enterprise, is greater.


352
0:25:18,634 --> 0:25:22,102
Captain, I believe this is our best course
to understand what has been happening.


353
0:25:22,102 --> 0:25:25,842
Mr Scott, Spock and I are going to deal with Ohn.
Rand, maintain our position, here.


354
0:25:25,842 --> 0:25:28,606
- Aye, sir.
- Aye, sir.


355
0:25:28,606 --> 0:25:31,205
Scott to engineering.
I need a team to assist me


356
0:25:31,205 --> 0:25:39,6
near the main junction circuitry
at the matter/anti-matter chamber.


357
0:25:39,6 --> 0:25:40,909
Ohn, this is Captain Kirk.


358
0:25:40,909 --> 0:25:44,477
Yes, Captain. Mr Spock
may touch my mind.


359
0:25:44,477 --> 0:25:47,479
It is impressive that you knew of
our goal before we told you, Ohn.


360
0:25:47,479 --> 0:25:51,103
How did you come by this knowledge?


361
0:25:51,103 --> 0:25:53,982
I guess we are just going to have to
get this knowledge for ourselves.


362
0:25:53,982 --> 0:25:59,336
Be careful, Spock.


363
0:25:59,336 --> 0:26:3,847
Ohn, stop what you are doing!
Spock!


364
0:26:3,847 --> 0:26:10,26
Captain, with your permission, I shall now discuss
these fuel equations with the engineer.


365
0:26:10,26 --> 0:26:14,601
Mr Spock... welcome aboard.


366
0:26:14,601 --> 0:26:21,666
I have been, and always shall be, your friend.


367
0:26:21,666 --> 0:26:24,752
Live long and prosper.


368
0:26:24,752 --> 0:26:30,45
No.


369
0:26:30,45 --> 0:26:31,74
Don't you remember?


370
0:26:31,74 --> 0:26:33,365
Ship... out of danger?


371
0:26:33,365 --> 0:26:39,105
You saved the ship. You saved us all.
Don't you remember?


372
0:26:39,105 --> 0:26:41,545
- No - Yes
- No - Yes


373
0:26:41,545 --> 0:26:44,394
I love Italian food, and so do you.


374
0:26:44,394 --> 0:26:47,456
Yes.


375
0:26:47,456 --> 0:26:49,912
I thought I was going to die.


376
0:26:49,912 --> 0:26:52,967
Not possible, you were never alone.


377
0:26:52,967 --> 0:26:55,7
Don't believe them, don't trust them!


378
0:26:55,7 --> 0:27:1,8
- They are dying.
- Let them die!


379
0:27:1,8 --> 0:27:12,229
It was... fun. Oh my...
Spock.


380
0:27:12,229 --> 0:27:21,2
Gentlemen. Captain Kirk is alive.


381
0:27:21,2 --> 0:27:22,693
Oh, are you alright, Mr Spock?


382
0:27:22,693 --> 0:27:25,252
I am undamaged. Physically.


383
0:27:25,252 --> 0:27:30,103
How did you get down here?
Can you explain what just happened?


384
0:27:30,103 --> 0:27:33,207
Those images were of no
memories that I ever recall.


385
0:27:33,207 --> 0:27:36,808
Ohn gave you a gift, Captain.
Do you not recognize your own ambition?


386
0:27:36,808 --> 0:27:39,962
I fail to see how answering in
riddles will accomplish anything.


387
0:27:39,962 --> 0:27:42,742
Those images that were shown
to us, were they the future?


388
0:27:42,742 --> 0:27:45,693
The future is not written, Mr Spock.


389
0:27:45,693 --> 0:27:48,671
As to what you saw,
I have no control over Ohn.


390
0:27:48,671 --> 0:27:52,431
No control over Ohn? Then that means that
that thing is a danger to the Enterprise.


391
0:27:52,431 --> 0:27:57,393
Captain, do you not see, we are the same?
Ohn is younger, but we are the same.


392
0:27:57,393 --> 0:28:0,546
The threat is not from us, Captain Kirk.
The threat is from without.


393
0:28:0,546 --> 0:28:3,46
We have found no physical
evidence of your intruder.


394
0:28:3,46 --> 0:28:6,867
In addition, it is highly probably that Ohn
is directly affecting ship operations.


395
0:28:6,867 --> 0:28:12,1
That in itself is reason enough to consider
that both he and yourself, the true threat.


396
0:28:12,1 --> 0:28:16,822
You believe me to be a threat?
You have no idea what's out there.


397
0:28:16,822 --> 0:28:22,335
The Breen, the Cardassians,
the Hirogen, the Dominion!


398
0:28:22,335 --> 0:28:25,833
I'd have tried to make friends!


399
0:28:25,833 --> 0:28:28,536
Get ready, Captain.
None compare to the Mot-Nahp.


400
0:28:28,536 --> 0:28:32,361
We don't respond well to threats, Onabi.


401
0:28:32,361 --> 0:28:34,829
All hands, man your battle stations.


402
0:28:34,829 --> 0:28:36,382
This is the Captain. Report!


403
0:28:36,382 --> 0:28:42,764
Captain, the intruder has
returned and is engaging.


404
0:28:42,764 --> 0:28:47,681
I am on my way to the bridge.


405
0:28:47,681 --> 0:29:5,71
I hope he's up to the game.


406
0:29:5,71 --> 0:29:8,191
- Report!
- Sir, shields are at 50%.


407
0:29:8,191 --> 0:29:10,825
Another few hits like that and
we will lose them altogether.


408
0:29:10,825 --> 0:29:16,147
I've ordered Mr Scott to bring
the mains back online.


409
0:29:16,147 --> 0:29:17,922
What's she doing up here?


410
0:29:17,922 --> 0:29:19,628
Just keep her out of the way.


411
0:29:19,628 --> 0:29:23,568
Mr DeSalle, course 213 mark 4,
three-quarters impulse power.


412
0:29:23,568 --> 0:29:24,178
Aye, sir.


413
0:29:24,178 --> 0:29:25,682
Lieutenant Uhura, anything?


414
0:29:25,682 --> 0:29:27,907
Negative, sir. Hailing on all channels.


415
0:29:27,907 --> 0:29:32,752
- They're coming for another pass.
- Hang on!


416
0:29:32,752 --> 0:29:35,776
Take evasive action!
Get us out of that things line of fire!


417
0:29:35,776 --> 0:29:43,549
Aye, sir!


418
0:29:43,549 --> 0:29:48,193
Captain, we'll not survive another hit like that.
We've got batteries only.


419
0:29:48,193 --> 0:29:51,687
- Scotty, I need emergency power.
- Aye sir, I'm working on it.


420
0:29:51,687 --> 0:29:56,792
Captain, I'm receiving damage reports from
all over the ship. Medical teams are responding.


421
0:29:56,792 --> 0:29:59,849
Captain, if we maintain this course,
we'll enter the Klaxor disturbance.


422
0:29:59,849 --> 0:30:2,28
Our shields and sensors will be useless.


423
0:30:2,28 --> 0:30:4,693
And so will the Mot-nahps.
Take us in, Mr DeSalle.


424
0:30:4,693 --> 0:30:6,63
Aye, sir.


425
0:30:6,63 --> 0:30:8,95
Aren't we going to fight?


426
0:30:8,95 --> 0:30:10,686
This isn't a fight we can win.
This is about survival.


427
0:30:10,686 --> 0:30:13,838
Take us as far in as we can go, Mr DeSalle.


428
0:30:13,838 --> 0:30:26,28
Aye, sir. Entering the Klaxor disturbance, now.


429
0:30:26,28 --> 0:30:28,925
Spock, anything on the sensors?


430
0:30:28,925 --> 0:30:31,473
Negative. As I warned,
sensors are inoperative.


431
0:30:31,473 --> 0:30:33,552
Communications are
down as well, Captain.


432
0:30:33,552 --> 0:30:36,578
- Mr Scott, report.
- The mains are back online.


433
0:30:36,578 --> 0:30:44,881
Seems there was nothing wrong
as Mr Spock suggested.


434
0:30:44,881 --> 0:30:46,756
What was that?


435
0:30:46,756 --> 0:30:49,159
The Mot-nahp is trying to
determine your location,


436
0:30:49,159 --> 0:30:52,176
by setting off anti-matter
charges within the disturbance.


437
0:30:52,176 --> 0:30:54,212
That means his sensors are down, too.


438
0:30:54,212 --> 0:30:57,139
Spock, can you track where that
weapons fire is coming from?


439
0:30:57,139 --> 0:30:59,328
Our deflector-screens are
directing particles in such a way


440
0:30:59,328 --> 0:31:2,674
that we may be able to get a general
idea of where the intruder is.


441
0:31:2,674 --> 0:31:5,94
- How general?
- Within a kilometre.


442
0:31:5,94 --> 0:31:8,678
It would appear I owe you an apology.


443
0:31:8,678 --> 0:31:10,935
None needed, Captain.


444
0:31:10,935 --> 0:31:14,115
Of course, what you do next
will determine your fate.


445
0:31:14,115 --> 0:31:18,594
With a word, you will either
doom or save your ship and crew.


446
0:31:18,594 --> 0:31:23,369
Let me help.


447
0:31:23,369 --> 0:31:27,21
Rand, do we have enough power to transport
Ohn and Onabi back to their vessel?


448
0:31:27,21 --> 0:31:28,6
Barely, sir.


449
0:31:28,6 --> 0:31:31,669
Funnel all ship's power including life
support into the transporter-room.


450
0:31:31,669 --> 0:31:32,307
Sir?


451
0:31:32,307 --> 0:31:35,143
Do it! It may be our only hope.


452
0:31:35,143 --> 0:31:49,96
Mr Spock, would you please escort Onabi
to the transporter-room? - Aye, sir.


453
0:31:49,96 --> 0:31:52,88
Anything Rand?


454
0:31:52,88 --> 0:31:53,866
Too much interference, sir


455
0:31:53,866 --> 0:31:56,897
You performed rather well,
while in command.


456
0:31:56,897 --> 0:32:0,369
You kept your head in a crisis.
That's the first major test


457
0:32:0,369 --> 0:32:1,918
every commander has to face.


458
0:32:1,918 --> 0:32:5,857
Knowing whether or not you'll rise
to the occasion, or freeze - well done.


459
0:32:5,857 --> 0:32:7,405
Thank you, Captain Kirk.


460
0:32:7,405 --> 0:32:10,486
- Uhura, raise the transporter room.
- Aye, sir.


461
0:32:10,486 --> 0:32:15,89
- Transporter-room. Report.
- Spock here. We are almost ready.


462
0:32:15,89 --> 0:32:17,312
Onabi is communicating with Ohn, now.


463
0:32:17,312 --> 0:32:20,383
One could describe them as
being happy to see each other.


464
0:32:20,383 --> 0:32:22,957
We are ready now, sir.


465
0:32:22,957 --> 0:32:36,799
- Mr Spock, peace and long life.
- Live long and prosper.


466
0:32:36,799 --> 0:32:40,705
Seven years... what a waste!


467
0:32:40,705 --> 0:32:45,465
Ohn?


468
0:32:45,465 --> 0:32:50,655
- Well done, Mr Kyle.
- You too, sir.


469
0:32:50,655 --> 0:32:53,173
Transport complete, Captain.


470
0:32:53,173 --> 0:32:55,916
Very good Spock. Now get
back up here on the double.


471
0:32:55,916 --> 0:33:1,504
Affirmative.


472
0:33:1,504 --> 0:33:5,787
Captain, I'm receiving a very weak
signal from Onabi. It's audio only.


473
0:33:5,787 --> 0:33:7,586
Let's hear it, Lieutenant.


474
0:33:7,586 --> 0:33:12,75
Captain Kirk, if you'd be so kind
as to move your ship to 127 mark 3,


475
0:33:12,75 --> 0:33:15,252
I think we can get this taken care of.


476
0:33:15,252 --> 0:33:16,893
Mr DeSalle, lay in a course.


477
0:33:16,893 --> 0:33:19,163
That course will take us back to
the edge of the disturbance, sir.


478
0:33:19,163 --> 0:33:30,3
Go, DeSalle!


479
0:33:30,3 --> 0:33:38,95
Sir, the intruder is right on our tail!


480
0:33:38,95 --> 0:33:42,354
Mr DeSalle, bring us about, Chekov
fire phasers and photon torpedoes!


481
0:33:42,354 --> 0:33:52,5
Firing all phasers, torpedoes away!


482
0:33:52,5 --> 0:34:3,676
There's no effect, sir!


483
0:34:3,676 --> 0:34:6,156
Uhura, jettison the log buoy.
Signal all hands to abandon...


484
0:34:6,156 --> 0:34:16,39
- Captain, look!
- Stand by, Uhura.


485
0:34:16,39 --> 0:34:18,199
Spock, are the sensors back online?


486
0:34:18,199 --> 0:34:19,458
Affirmative, sir.


487
0:34:19,458 --> 0:34:22,226
I'm reading no sign of the intruder...


488
0:34:22,226 --> 0:34:23,48
...or of Onabi.


489
0:34:23,48 --> 0:34:27,184
- Can you track her course?
- Relaying coordinates to helm, now.


490
0:34:27,184 --> 0:34:36,839
DeSalle, follow that ship.


491
0:34:36,839 --> 0:34:38,514
Warp drive is down, sir.


492
0:34:38,514 --> 0:34:40,584
Scotty, report.


493
0:34:40,584 --> 0:34:43,206
Aye, the mains are down
and this time for certain.


494
0:34:43,206 --> 0:34:46,318
It will take several hours to repair, sir.


495
0:34:46,318 --> 0:34:49,595
So that's it?
It's over?


496
0:34:49,595 --> 0:34:51,896
It would appear so, Rand.
At least for now.


497
0:34:51,896 --> 0:34:57,672
- Mr Spock, anything from the sensors?
- Negative, Captain.


498
0:34:57,672 --> 0:35:0,92
Looks like Onabi had one
last trick up her sleeve.


499
0:35:0,92 --> 0:35:6,4
Ms Rand, have Scotty begin
damage control and keep on him.


500
0:35:6,4 --> 0:35:9,155
Don't let him fool you with those
factor-of-four time estimates.


501
0:35:9,155 --> 0:35:10,454
- Aye, sir.
- You have the bridge.


502
0:35:10,454 --> 0:35:14,754
Lt Uhura, encode to Starfleet command
my past week's log entries.


503
0:35:14,754 --> 0:35:23,0
Mr Spock, your with me.
- Aye, sir.


504
0:35:23,0 --> 0:35:26,967
Repair teams report to Mr Scott
in engineering, immediately.


505
0:35:26,967 --> 0:35:37,205
All hands stand down from Red Alert.


506
0:35:37,205 --> 0:35:40,694
Captain's personal log, stardate 6014.3


507
0:35:40,694 --> 0:35:45,11
We continue to clean up our battle damage
and repairs to the warp drive are nearly complete


508
0:35:45,11 --> 0:35:59,59
The ship and crew have performed well,
during this rather unique mission.


509
0:35:59,59 --> 0:36:2,145
What's that you are playing, Spock?
It sounds familiar.


510
0:36:2,145 --> 0:36:4,33
A hymn, doctor, from old Earth.


511
0:36:4,33 --> 0:36:6,505
The Captain recently introduced me to it.


512
0:36:6,505 --> 0:36:13,212
I find the tune, most comforting.


513
0:36:13,212 --> 0:36:15,315
What do you remember,
anything specific?


514
0:36:15,315 --> 0:36:18,46
Images mostly, Bones.
There's just nothing concrete.


515
0:36:18,46 --> 0:36:20,908
If it was indeed a glimpse at our future,


516
0:36:20,908 --> 0:36:23,11
perhaps we should re-examine
some of our methods.


517
0:36:23,11 --> 0:36:27,66
One possible glimpse, Spock. Onabi said,
the future is not yet written.


518
0:36:27,66 --> 0:36:30,485
Maybe what we saw was
just one possible outcome.


519
0:36:30,485 --> 0:36:34,605
Perhaps as the hymn says, 'tis grace
that's brought us safe thus far', Captain.


520
0:36:34,605 --> 0:36:37,43
That's it Spock. You've got it!


521
0:36:37,43 --> 0:36:40,862
Well, there's hope for him, yet.


522
0:36:40,862 --> 0:36:46,0
Of course, on the other hand by changing -
what was it Spock, our methods?


523
0:36:46,0 --> 0:36:48,954
That could be what causes
what you saw to come true.


524
0:36:48,954 --> 0:36:51,622
The doctor makes an
almost logical deduction.


525
0:36:51,622 --> 0:36:54,914
it would appear the timeline
has been altered, already.


526
0:36:54,914 --> 0:36:59,12
Was that a joke, Spock?
Is seemed like a joke.


527
0:36:59,12 --> 0:37:1,729
I am still puzzled as to the
nature of the intruder.


528
0:37:1,729 --> 0:37:5,565
If not a holographic image, they could be
a major threat to the federation.


529
0:37:5,565 --> 0:37:8,892
Well, maybe what we saw was
the vision of a future invader.


530
0:37:8,892 --> 0:37:12,184
God, I hope not. But I wouldn't mind
running into Onabi again.


531
0:37:12,184 --> 0:37:14,645
Gentlemen, that is for the future to decide.


532
0:37:14,645 --> 0:37:17,878
A future, I hope, with
many possibilities.


533
0:37:17,878 --> 0:37:21,614
Captain Kirk, Admiral
Leslie is calling on subspace.


534
0:37:21,614 --> 0:37:23,994
He insists on speaking with you.


535
0:37:23,994 --> 0:37:25,86
Put him through, Lieutenant.


536
0:37:25,86 --> 0:37:27,592
Captain?


537
0:37:27,592 --> 0:37:29,757
Admiral, I was just about
to send you my report.


538
0:37:29,757 --> 0:37:34,515
Fine, Kirk. In the meantime, let me tell
you about your next assignment.


539
0:37:34,515 --> 0:37:38,952
Oh, we're all ears, sir.


540
0:37:38,952 --> 0:37:46,506
You will proceed to the following coordinates
and rendezvous with two robot cargo ships.


541
0:37:46,506 --> 0:37:50,892
carrying a shipment of grain
to Sherman's Planet.


542
0:37:50,892 --> 0:37:55,98
Admiral, may I just say on our behalf...


543
0:37:55,98 --> 0:38:0,572
Oh no Kirk, oh no, wait.
There's more...


544
0:38:0,572 --> 0:38:19,273
Oh, boy.


545
0:38:19,273 --> 0:40:19,273
