###0 The President: Please, everybody have a seat.
###3 Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress,
###10 fellow Americans: Fifty-one years ago, John F. Kennedy
###16 declared to this chamber that "the Constitution makes us not
###22 "rivals for power but partners for progress."
###27 (applause)
###34 "It is my task," he said, "to report the State of the Union --
###40 "to improve it is the task of us all."
###46 Tonight, thanks to the grit and determination of the American
###50 people, there is much progress to report.
###55 After a decade of grinding war, our brave men and women in
###59 uniform are coming home.
###62 (applause)
###82 After years of grueling recession,
###85 our businesses have created over six million new jobs.
###90 We buy more American cars than we have in five years,
###94 and less foreign oil than we have in 20.
###97 (applause)
###103 Our housing market is healing, our stock market is rebounding,
###108 and consumers, patients, and homeowners enjoy stronger
###112 protections than ever before.
###114 (applause)
###118 So, together, we have cleared away the rubble of crisis,
###125 and we can say with renewed confidence that the State of our
###129 Union is stronger.
###131 (applause)
###144 But we gather here knowing that there are millions of Americans
###150 whose hard work and dedication have not yet been rewarded.
###155 Our economy is adding jobs -- but too many people still can't
###158 find full-time employment.
###161 Corporate profits have skyrocketed to all-time highs --
###165 but for more than a decade, wages and incomes have
###168 barely budged.
###171 It is our generation's task, then,
###174 to reignite the true engine of America's economic growth --
###178 a rising, thriving middle class.
###180 (applause)
###194 It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that
###198 built this country -- the idea that if you work hard and meet
###202 your responsibilities, you can get ahead,
###205 no matter where you come from, no matter what you look like,
###208 or who you love.
###211 It is our unfinished task to make sure that this government
###214 works on behalf of the many, and not just the few;
###217 that it encourages free enterprise,
###221 rewards individual initiative, and opens the doors of
###225 opportunity to every child across this great nation.
###228 (applause)
###236 The American people don't expect government to solve
###239 every problem.
###242 They don't expect those of us in this chamber to agree on
###245 every issue.
###247 But they do expect us to put the nation's interests before party.
###251 (applause)
###272 They do expect us to forge reasonable compromise
###275 where we can.
###277 For they know that America moves forward only when we do so
###280 together, and that the responsibility of improving this
###284 union remains the task of us all.
###289 Our work must begin by making some basic decisions about our
###293 budget -- decisions that will have a huge impact on the
###297 strength of our recovery.
###300 Over the last few years, both parties have worked together to
###303 reduce the deficit by more than $2.5 trillion --
###307 mostly through spending cuts, but also by raising tax rates on
###312 the wealthiest 1% of Americans.
###316 As a result, we are more than halfway towards the goal of
###320 $4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to
###324 stabilize our finances.
###327 Now we need to finish the job.
###330 And the question is, how?
###333 In 2011, Congress passed a law saying that if both parties
###337 couldn't agree on a plan to reach our deficit goal,
###341 about a trillion dollars' worth of budget cuts would
###344 automatically go into effect this year.
###348 These sudden, harsh, arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our
###353 military readiness.
###356 They'd devastate priorities like education, and energy,
###359 and medical research.
###362 They would certainly slow our recovery,
###365 and cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs.
###369 That's why Democrats, Republicans, business leaders,
###372 and economists have already said that these cuts,
###375 known here in Washington as the sequester,
###378 are a really bad idea.
###382 Now, some in Congress have proposed preventing only the
###387 defense cuts by making even bigger cuts to things like
###391 education and job training, Medicare and Social
###395 Security benefits.
###398 That idea is even worse.
###400 (applause)
###417 Yes, the biggest driver of our long-term debt is the rising
###421 cost of health care for an aging population.
###424 And those of us who care deeply about programs like Medicare
###428 must embrace the need for modest reforms --
###431 otherwise, our retirement programs will crowd out the
###435 investments we need for our children,
###437 and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for
###440 future generations.
###441 But we can't ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder
###446 the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing
###450 more from the wealthiest and the most powerful.
###452 (applause)
###459 We won't grow the middle class simply by shifting the cost of
###461 health care or college onto families that are already
###464 struggling, or by forcing communities to lay off more
###467 teachers and more cops and more firefighters.
###471 Most Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents --
###476 understand that we can't just cut our way to prosperity.
###481 They know that broad-based economic growth requires a
###484 balanced approach to deficit reduction,
###486 with spending cuts and revenue, and with everybody doing
###491 their fair share.
###493 And that's the approach I offer tonight.
###497 On Medicare, I'm prepared to enact reforms that will achieve
###500 the same amount of health care savings by the beginning of the
###503 next decade as the reforms proposed by the bipartisan
###506 Simpson-Bowles commission.
###507 (applause)
###511 Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of
###514 health care costs.
###516 (applause)
###520 And the reforms I'm proposing go even further.
###523 We'll reduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies
###527 and ask more from the wealthiest seniors.
###529 (applause)
###530 We'll bring down costs by changing the way our government
###534 pays for Medicare, because our medical bills shouldn't be based
###536 on the number of tests ordered or days spent in the hospital;
###540 they should be based on the quality of care that our
###542 seniors receive.
###543 (applause)
###552 And I am open to additional reforms from both parties,
###556 so long as they don't violate the guarantee of a
###559 secure retirement.
###561 Our government shouldn't make promises we cannot keep --
###564 but we must keep the promises we've already made.
###567 (applause)
###584 To hit the rest of our deficit reduction target,
###588 we should do what leaders in both parties have already
###590 suggested, and save hundreds of billions of dollars by getting
###595 rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the well-off and
###597 the well-connected.
###600 After all, why would we choose to make deeper cuts to education
###604 and Medicare just to protect special interest tax breaks?
###609 How is that fair?
###611 Why is it that deficit reduction is a big emergency justifying
###616 making cuts in Social Security benefits but not closing
###619 some loopholes?
###621 How does that promote growth?
###623 (applause)
###627 Now is our best chance for bipartisan,
###631 comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and
###635 helps bring down the deficit.
###637 (applause)
###642 We can get this done.
###651 The American people deserve a tax code that helps small
###654 businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms,
###657 and more time expanding and hiring --
###660 a tax code that ensures billionaires with high-powered
###662 accountants can't work the system and pay a lower rate than
###665 their hardworking secretaries; a tax code that lowers incentives
###669 to move jobs overseas, and lowers tax rates for businesses
###673 and manufacturers that are creating jobs right here in the
###676 United States of America.
###677 That's what tax reform can deliver.
###680 That's what we can do together.
###681 (applause)
###691 I realize that tax reform and entitlement reform will
###695 not be easy.
###698 The politics will be hard for both sides.
###702 None of us will get 100% of what we want.
###706 But the alternative will cost us jobs, hurt our economy,
###711 visit hardship on millions of hardworking Americans.
###716 So let's set party interests aside and work to pass a budget
###720 that replaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise
###724 investments in our future.
###726 And let's do it without the brinksmanship that stresses
###728 consumers and scares off investors.
###731 (applause)
###736 The greatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its
###738 business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next.
###741 (applause)
###743 We can't do it.
###744 (applause)
###751 Let's agree right here, right now to keep the people's
###756 government open, and pay our bills on time,
###759 and always uphold the full faith and credit of the United States
###763 of America.
###764 (applause)
###775 The American people have worked too hard, for too long,
###778 rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials
###782 cause another.
###783 (applause)
###785 Now, most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must
###791 be part of our agenda.
###793 But let's be clear, deficit reduction alone is not an
###799 economic plan.
###801 (applause)
###805 A growing economy that creates good, middle-class jobs --
###809 that must be the North Star that guides our efforts.
###812 (applause)
###820 Every day, we should ask ourselves three questions as a
###823 nation: How do we attract more jobs to our shores?
###827 How do we equip our people with the skills they need to
###830 get those jobs?
###832 And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a
###835 decent living?
###838 A year and a half ago, I put forward an American Jobs Act
###841 that independent economists said would create more than
###843 1 million new jobs.
###844 And I thank the last Congress for passing some of that agenda.
###849 I urge this Congress to pass the rest.
###852 (applause)
###853 But tonight, I'll lay out additional proposals that are
###857 fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget
###861 framework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago.
###865 Let me repeat -- nothing I'm proposing tonight should
###870 increase our deficit by a single dime.
###872 It is not a bigger government we need,
###875 but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in
###879 broad-based growth.
###880 (applause)
###883 That's what we should be looking for.
###884 (applause)
###894 Our first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs
###898 and manufacturing.
###900 After shedding jobs for more than 10 years,
###903 our manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over
###906 the past three.
###908 Caterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan.
###911 Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico.
###914 And this year, Apple will start making Macs in America again.
###917 (applause)
###923 There are things we can do, right now,
###925 to accelerate this trend.
###928 Last year, we created our first manufacturing innovation
###931 institute in Youngstown, Ohio.
###932 A once-shuttered warehouse is now a state-of-the art lab where
###937 new workers are mastering the 3D printing that has the potential
###940 to revolutionize the way we make almost everything.
###944 There's no reason this can't happen in other towns.
###947 So tonight, I'm announcing the launch of three more of these
###950 manufacturing hubs, where businesses will partner with the
###953 Department of Defense and Energy to turn regions left behind by
###957 globalization into global centers of high-tech jobs.
###961 And I ask this Congress to help create a network of 15 of these
###965 hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is
###968 made right here in America.
###970 We can get that done.
###972 (applause)
###986 Now, if we want to make the best products,
###988 we also have to invest in the best ideas.
###993 Every dollar we invested to map the human genome returned $140
###999 to our economy -- every dollar.
###1002 Today, our scientists are mapping the human brain to
###1005 unlock the answers to Alzheimer's.
###1008 They're developing drugs to regenerate damaged organs;
###1012 devising new material to make batteries 10 times
###1015 more powerful.
###1017 Now is not the time to gut these job-creating investments in
###1020 science and innovation.
###1022 Now is the time to reach a level of research and development not
###1026 seen since the height of the Space Race.
###1028 We need to make those investments.
###1030 (applause)
###1040 Today, no area holds more promise than our investments in
###1043 American energy.
###1046 After years of talking about it, we're finally poised to control
###1051 our own energy future.
###1053 We produce more oil at home than we have in 15 years.
###1056 (applause)
###1058 We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas,
###1062 and the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources
###1065 like wind and solar -- with tens of thousands of good American
###1068 jobs to show for it.
###1070 We produce more natural gas than ever before --
###1074 and nearly everyone's energy bill is lower because of it.
###1077 And over the last four years, our emissions of the dangerous
###1081 carbon pollution that threatens our planet have actually fallen.
###1087 But for the sake of our children and our future,
###1091 we must do more to combat climate change.
###1094 (applause)
###1108 Now, it's true that no single event makes a trend.
###1114 But the fact is the 12 hottest years on record have all come in
###1119 the last 15.
###1122 Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods --
###1128 all are now more frequent and more intense.
###1132 We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy,
###1136 and the most severe drought in decades,
###1138 and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all
###1141 just a freak coincidence.
###1144 Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of
###1147 science -- and act before it's too late.
###1150 (applause)
###1158 Now, the good news is we can make meaningful progress on this
###1161 issue while driving strong economic growth.
###1165 I urge this Congress to get together, pursue a bipartisan,
###1168 market-based solution to climate change,
###1170 like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a
###1173 few years ago.
###1175 But if Congress won't act soon to protect future generations,
###1180 I will.
###1181 (applause)
###1185 I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can
###1188 take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution,
###1191 prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change,
###1195 and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.
###1200 Four years ago, other countries dominated the clean energy
###1203 market and the jobs that came with it.
###1205 And we've begun to change that.
###1208 Last year, wind energy added nearly half of all new power
###1211 capacity in America.
###1213 So let's generate even more.
###1216 Solar energy gets cheaper by the year --
###1217 let's drive down costs even further.
###1221 As long as countries like China keep going all in on clean
###1223 energy, so must we.
###1226 Now, in the meantime, the natural gas boom has led to
###1230 cleaner power and greater energy independence.
###1233 We need to encourage that.
###1234 And that's why my administration will keep cutting red tape and
###1237 speeding up new oil and gas permits.
###1240 (applause)
###1241 That's got to be part of an all-of-the-above plan.
###1244 But I also want to work with this Congress to encourage the
###1247 research and technology that helps natural gas burn even
###1250 cleaner and protects our air and our water.
###1255 In fact, much of our new-found energy is drawn from lands and
###1258 waters that we, the public, own together.
###1263 So tonight, I propose we use some of our oil and gas revenues
###1265 to fund an Energy Security Trust that will drive new research and
###1269 technology to shift our cars and trucks off oil for good.
###1274 If a nonpartisan coalition of CEOs and retired generals and
###1277 admirals can get behind this idea, then so can we.
###1281 Let's take their advice and free our families and businesses from
###1285 the painful spikes in gas prices we've put up with for
###1288 far too long.
###1291 I'm also issuing a new goal for America:
###1293 Let's cut in half the energy wasted by our homes and
###1296 businesses over the next 20 years.
###1298 (applause)
###1306 We'll work with the states to do it.
###1307 Those states with the best ideas to create jobs and lower energy
###1310 bills by constructing more efficient buildings will receive
###1313 federal support to help make that happen.
###1318 America's energy sector is just one part of an aging
###1321 infrastructure badly in need of repair.
###1325 Ask any CEO where they'd rather locate and hire --
###1328 a country with deteriorating roads and bridges,
###1331 or one with high-speed rail and Internet; high-tech schools,
###1335 self-healing power grids.
###1338 The CEO of Siemens America -- a company that brought hundreds of
###1341 new jobs to North Carolina -- said that if we upgrade our
###1344 infrastructure, they'll bring even more jobs.
###1347 And that's the attitude of a lot of companies all
###1349 around the world.
###1351 And I know you want these job-creating projects in
###1353 your district.
###1354 I've seen all those ribbon-cuttings.
###1355 (laughter)
###1361 So tonight, I propose a "Fix-It-First" program to put
###1368 people to work as soon as possible on our most urgent
###1371 repairs, like the nearly 70,000 structurally deficient bridges
###1375 across the country.
###1376 (applause)
###1391 And to make sure taxpayers don't shoulder the whole burden,
###1394 I'm also proposing a Partnership to Rebuild America that attracts
###1398 private capital to upgrade what our businesses need most:
###1402 modern ports to move our goods, modern pipelines to withstand a
###1406 storm, modern schools worthy of our children.
###1411 (applause)
###1411 Let's prove that there's no better place to do business than
###1414 here in the United States of America,
###1416 and let's start right away.
###1418 We can get this done.
###1420 And part of our rebuilding effort must also involve our
###1423 housing sector.
###1426 The good news is our housing market is finally healing from
###1429 the collapse of 2007.
###1431 Home prices are rising at the fastest pace in six years.
###1436 Home purchases are up nearly 50%,
###1439 and construction is expanding again.
###1442 But even with mortgage rates near a 50-year low,
###1447 too many families with solid credit who want to buy a home
###1450 are being rejected.
###1452 Too many families who never missed a payment and want to
###1456 refinance are being told no.
###1460 That's holding our entire economy back.
###1462 We need to fix it.
###1465 Right now, there's a bill in this Congress that would give
###1467 every responsible homeowner in America the chance to save
###1471 $3,000 a year by refinancing at today's rates.
###1477 Democrats and Republicans have supported it before,
###1480 so what are we waiting for?
###1482 Take a vote, and send me that bill.
###1484 (applause)
###1491 Why would we be against that?
###1493 (applause)
###1499 Why would that be a partisan issue, helping folks refinance?
###1504 Right now, overlapping regulations keep responsible
###1507 young families from buying their first home.
###1510 What's holding us back?
###1511 Let's streamline the process, and help our economy grow.
###1517 These initiatives in manufacturing, energy,
###1520 infrastructure, housing -- all these things will help
###1524 entrepreneurs and small business owners expand and
###1527 create new jobs.
###1529 But none of it will matter unless we also equip our
###1532 citizens with the skills and training to fill those jobs.
###1536 (applause)
###1543 And that has to start at the earliest possible age.
###1548 Study after study shows that the sooner a child begins learning,
###1553 the better he or she does down the road.
###1557 But today, fewer than 3 in 10 four year-olds are enrolled in a
###1561 high-quality preschool program.
###1564 Most middle-class parents can't afford a few hundred bucks a
###1567 week for a private preschool.
###1569 And for poor kids who need help the most,
###1573 this lack of access to preschool education can shadow them for
###1576 the rest of their lives.
###1579 So tonight, I propose working with states to make high-quality
###1583 preschool available to every single child in America.
###1587 (applause)
###1590 That's something we should be able to do.
###1592 (applause)
###1606 Every dollar we invest in high-quality early childhood
###1609 education can save more than seven dollars later on --
###1613 by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy,
###1618 even reducing violent crime.
###1621 In states that make it a priority to educate our youngest
###1624 children, like Georgia or Oklahoma,
###1628 studies show students grow up more likely to read and do math
###1633 at grade level, graduate high school, hold a job,
###1637 form more stable families of their own.
###1641 We know this works.
###1643 So let's do what works and make sure none of our children start
###1646 the race of life already behind.
###1648 Let's give our kids that chance.
###1650 (applause)
###1662 Let's also make sure that a high school diploma puts our kids on
###1666 a path to a good job.
###1669 Right now, countries like Germany focus on graduating
###1672 their high school students with the equivalent of a technical
###1675 degree from one of our community colleges.
###1678 So those German kids, they're ready for a job when they
###1680 graduate high school.
###1682 They've been trained for the jobs that are there.
###1686 Now at schools like P-Tech in Brooklyn,
###1688 a collaboration between New York Public Schools and City
###1691 University of New York and IBM, students will graduate with a
###1695 high school diploma and an associate's degree in computers
###1699 or engineering.
###1701 We need to give every American student opportunities like this.
###1704 (applause)
###1705 And four years ago, we started Race to the Top --
###1712 a competition that convinced almost every state to develop
###1715 smarter curricula and higher standards,
###1718 all for about 1% of what we spend on education each year.
###1722 Tonight, I'm announcing a new challenge to redesign America's
###1726 high schools so they better equip graduates for the demands
###1730 of a high-tech economy.
###1731 And we'll reward schools that develop new partnerships with
###1734 colleges and employers, and create classes that focus on
###1737 science, technology, engineering and math --
###1742 the skills today's employers are looking for to fill the jobs
###1745 that are there right now and will be there in the future.
###1750 Now, even with better high schools,
###1752 most young people will need some higher education.
###1756 It's a simple fact the more education you've got,
###1760 the more likely you are to have a good job and work your way
###1763 into the middle class.
###1765 But today, skyrocketing costs price too many young people out
###1768 of a higher education, or saddle them with unsustainable debt.
###1775 Through tax credits, grants and better loans,
###1778 we've made college more affordable for millions of
###1780 students and families over the last few years.
###1784 But taxpayers can't keep on subsidizing higher and higher
###1787 and higher costs for higher education.
###1791 Colleges must do their part to keep costs down,
###1794 and it's our job to make sure that they do.
###1796 (applause)
###1803 So tonight, I ask Congress to change the Higher Education Act
###1806 so that affordability and value are included in determining
###1810 which colleges receive certain types of federal aid.
###1813 (applause)
###1818 And tomorrow, my administration will release a new
###1820 "College Scorecard" that parents and students can use to compare
###1824 schools based on a simple criteria --
###1826 where you can get the most bang for your educational buck.
###1831 Now, to grow our middle class, our citizens have to have access
###1836 to the education and training that today's jobs require.
###1838 But we also have to make sure that America remains a place
###1842 where everyone who's willing to work --
###1845 everybody who's willing to work hard has the chance to
###1848 get ahead.
###1850 Our economy is stronger when we harness the talents and
###1854 ingenuity of striving, hopeful immigrants.
###1857 (applause)
###1860 And right now, leaders from the business, labor,
###1863 law enforcement, faith communities --
###1865 they all agree that the time has come to pass comprehensive
###1869 immigration reform.
###1870 (applause)
###1871 Now is the time to do it.
###1872 Now is the time to get it done.
###1877 Now is the time to get it done.
###1879 (applause)
###1891 Real reform means stronger border security,
###1895 and we can build on the progress my administration has already
###1896 made -- putting more boots on the Southern border than at any
###1901 time in our history and reducing illegal crossings to their
###1905 lowest levels in 40 years.
###1908 Real reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earned
###1912 citizenship -- a path that includes passing a background
###1915 check, paying taxes and a meaningful penalty,
###1919 learning English, and going to the back of the line behind the
###1922 folks trying to come here legally.
###1924 (applause)
###1929 And real reform means fixing the legal immigration system to cut
###1934 waiting periods and attract the highly-skilled entrepreneurs and
###1938 engineers that will help create jobs and grow our economy.
###1941 (applause)
###1954 In other words, we know what needs to be done.
###1959 And as we speak, bipartisan groups in both chambers are
###1962 working diligently to draft a bill,
###1964 and I applaud their efforts.
###1966 So let's get this done.
###1968 Send me a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the
###1971 next few months, and I will sign it right away.
###1973 And America will be better for it.
###1975 (applause)
###1976 Let's get it done.
###1977 Let's get it done.
###1978 (applause)
###1988 But we can't stop there.
###1991 We know our economy is stronger when our wives, our mothers,
###1995 our daughters can live their lives free from discrimination
###1998 in the workplace, and free from the fear of domestic violence.
###2003 Today, the Senate passed the Violence Against Women Act that
###2006 Joe Biden originally wrote almost 20 years ago.
###2009 And I now urge the House to do the same.
###2012 (applause)
###2016 Good job, Joe.
###2017 (applause)
###2026 And I ask this Congress to declare that women should earn a
###2029 living equal to their efforts, and finally pass the Paycheck
###2034 Fairness Act this year.
###2035 (applause)
###2048 We know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest day's
###2051 work with honest wages.
###2055 But today, a full-time worker making the minimum wage earns
###2058 $14,500 a year.
###2063 Even with the tax relief we put in place,
###2067 a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still
###2070 lives below the poverty line.
###2073 That's wrong.
###2076 That's why, since the last time this Congress raised the minimum
###2078 wage, 19 states have chosen to bump theirs even higher.
###2083 Tonight, let's declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth,
###2087 no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty,
###2091 and raise the federal minimum wage to $9.00 an hour.
###2094 (applause)
###2098 We should be able to get that done.
###2100 (applause)
###2107 This single step would raise the incomes of millions of
###2110 working families.
###2112 It could mean the difference between groceries or the food
###2115 bank; rent or eviction; scraping by or finally getting ahead.
###2121 For businesses across the country,
###2123 it would mean customers with more money in their pockets.
###2125 And a whole lot of folks out there would probably need less
###2129 help from government.
###2132 In fact, working folks shouldn't have to wait year after year for
###2135 the minimum wage to go up while CEO pay has never been higher.
###2139 So here's an idea that Governor Romney and I actually agreed on
###2143 last year -- let's tie the minimum wage to the cost of
###2146 living, so that it finally becomes a wage you can live on.
###2149 (applause)
###2161 Tonight, let's also recognize that there are communities in
###2164 this country where no matter how hard you work,
###2166 it is virtually impossible to get ahead.
###2170 Factory towns decimated from years of plants packing up.
###2174 Inescapable pockets of poverty, urban and rural,
###2178 where young adults are still fighting for their first job.
###2183 America is not a place where the chance of birth or circumstance
###2185 should decide our destiny.
###2187 And that's why we need to build new ladders of opportunity into
###2191 the middle class for all who are willing to climb them.
###2195 Let's offer incentives to companies that hire Americans
###2197 who've got what it takes to fill that job opening,
###2199 but have been out of work so long that no one will give them
###2202 a chance anymore.
###2204 Let's put people back to work rebuilding vacant homes in
###2207 run-down neighborhoods.
###2209 And this year, my administration will begin to partner with 20 of
###2213 the hardest-hit towns in America to get these communities back
###2216 on their feet.
###2217 We'll work with local leaders to target resources at public
###2220 safety, and education, and housing.
###2224 We'll give new tax credits to businesses that hire and invest.
###2228 And we'll work to strengthen families by removing the
###2231 financial deterrents to marriage for low-income couples,
###2234 and do more to encourage fatherhood --
###2236 because what makes you a man isn't the ability to conceive a
###2239 child; it's having the courage to raise one.
###2243 And we want to encourage that.
###2245 We want to help that.
###2246 (applause)
###2260 Stronger families.
###2262 Stronger communities.
###2264 A stronger America.
###2267 It is this kind of prosperity -- broad, shared,
###2272 built on a thriving middle class --
###2275 that has always been the source of our progress at home.
###2279 It's also the foundation of our power and influence
###2282 throughout the world.
###2285 Tonight, we stand united in saluting the troops and
###2288 civilians who sacrifice every day to protect us.
###2292 Because of them, we can say with confidence that America will
###2296 complete its mission in Afghanistan and achieve our
###2299 objective of defeating the core of al Qaeda.
###2303 (applause)
###2320 Already, we have brought home 33,000 of our brave servicemen
###2324 and women.
###2326 This spring, our forces will move into a support role,
###2329 while Afghan security forces take the lead.
###2333 Tonight, I can announce that over the next year,
###2336 another 34,000 American troops will come home from Afghanistan.
###2340 This drawdown will continue and by the end of next year,
###2344 our war in Afghanistan will be over.
###2347 (applause)
###2363 Beyond 2014, America's commitment to a unified and
###2367 sovereign Afghanistan will endure,
###2370 but the nature of our commitment will change.
###2373 We're negotiating an agreement with the Afghan government that
###2376 focuses on two missions -- training and equipping Afghan
###2380 forces so that the country does not again slip into chaos,
###2384 and counterterrorism efforts that allow us to pursue the
###2387 remnants of al Qaeda and their affiliates.
###2391 Today, the organization that attacked us on 9/11 is a shadow
###2396 of its former self.
###2397 (applause)
###2403 It's true, different al Qaeda affiliates and extremist groups
###2406 have emerged -- from the Arabian Peninsula to Africa.
###2411 The threat these groups pose is evolving.
###2415 But to meet this threat, we don't need to send tens of
###2418 thousands of our sons and daughters abroad or occupy
###2421 other nations.
###2423 Instead, we'll need to help countries like Yemen, and Libya,
###2426 and Somalia provide for their own security,
###2429 and help allies who take the fight to terrorists,
###2431 as we have in Mali.
###2434 And where necessary, through a range of capabilities,
###2437 we will continue to take direct action against those terrorists
###2441 who pose the gravest threat to Americans.
###2444 (applause)
###2448 Now, as we do, we must enlist our values in the fight.
###2458 That's why my administration has worked tirelessly to forge a
###2462 durable legal and policy framework to guide our
###2465 counterterrorism efforts.
###2468 Throughout, we have kept Congress fully informed of
###2471 our efforts.
###2473 I recognize that in our democracy,
###2476 no one should just take my word for it that we're doing things
###2478 the right way.
###2480 So in the months ahead, I will continue to engage Congress to
###2483 ensure not only that our targeting,
###2486 detention and prosecution of terrorists remains consistent
###2489 with our laws and system of checks and balances,
###2493 but that our efforts are even more transparent to the American
###2496 people and to the world.
###2498 (applause)
###2503 Of course, our challenges don't end with al Qaeda.
###2507 America will continue to lead the effort to prevent the spread
###2510 of the world's most dangerous weapons.
###2513 The regime in North Korea must know they will only achieve
###2516 security and prosperity by meeting their
###2518 international obligations.
###2521 Provocations of the sort we saw last night will only further
###2524 isolate them, as we stand by our allies,
###2527 strengthen our own missile defense and lead the world in
###2530 taking firm action in response to these threats.
###2534 Likewise, the leaders of Iran must recognize that now is the
###2537 time for a diplomatic solution, because a coalition stands
###2540 united in demanding that they meet their obligations,
###2543 and we will do what is necessary to prevent them from getting a
###2547 nuclear weapon.
###2548 (applause)
###2563 At the same time, we'll engage Russia to seek further
###2567 reductions in our nuclear arsenals,
###2569 and continue leading the global effort to secure nuclear
###2572 materials that could fall into the wrong hands --
###2575 because our ability to influence others depends on our
###2578 willingness to lead and meet our obligations.
###2584 America must also face the rapidly growing threat
###2587 from cyber-attacks.
###2589 (applause)
###2591 Now, we know hackers steal people's identities and
###2594 infiltrate private emails.
###2597 We know foreign countries and companies swipe our
###2600 corporate secrets.
###2602 Now our enemies are also seeking the ability to sabotage our
###2605 power grid, our financial institutions,
###2609 our air traffic control systems.
###2612 We cannot look back years from now and wonder why we did
###2615 nothing in the face of real threats to our security and
###2619 our economy.
###2620 And that's why, earlier today, I signed a new executive order
###2623 that will strengthen our cyber defenses by increasing
###2626 information sharing, and developing standards to protect
###2629 our national security, our jobs, and our privacy.
###2632 (applause)
###2638 But now Congress must act as well,
###2642 by passing legislation to give our government a greater
###2646 capacity to secure our networks and deter attacks.
###2650 This is something we should be able to get done on a
###2652 bipartisan basis.
###2654 (applause)
###2661 Now, even as we protect our people,
###2663 we should remember that today's world presents not just dangers,
###2667 not just threats, it presents opportunities.
###2671 To boost American exports, support American jobs and level
###2675 the playing field in the growing markets of Asia,
###2678 we intend to complete negotiations on a
###2680 Trans-Pacific Partnership.
###2681 And tonight, I'm announcing that we will launch talks on a
###2685 comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership
###2688 with the European Union -- because trade that is fair and
###2691 free across the Atlantic supports millions of good-paying
###2695 American jobs.
###2696 (applause)
###2703 We also know that progress in the most impoverished parts of
###2708 our world enriches us all -- not only because it creates new
###2713 markets, more stable order in certain regions of the world,
###2718 but also because it's the right thing to do.
###2721 In many places, people live on little more than a dollar a day.
###2726 So the United States will join with our allies to eradicate
###2730 such extreme poverty in the next two decades by connecting more
###2733 people to the global economy; by empowering women;
###2737 by giving our young and brightest minds new
###2739 opportunities to serve, and helping communities to feed,
###2743 and power, and educate themselves;
###2745 by saving the world's children from preventable deaths;
###2749 and by realizing the promise of an AIDS-free generation,
###2753 which is within our reach.
###2755 (applause)
###2767 You see, America must remain a beacon to all who seek freedom
###2771 during this period of historic change.
###2775 I saw the power of hope last year in Rangoon, in Burma,
###2778 when Aung San Suu Kyi welcomed an American President into the
###2782 home where she had been imprisoned for years;
###2786 when thousands of Burmese lined the streets,
###2788 waving American flags, including a man who said,
###2792 "There is justice and law in the United States.
###2795 "I want our country to be like that."
###2800 In defense of freedom, we'll remain the anchor of strong
###2804 alliances from the Americas to Africa; from Europe to Asia.
###2809 In the Middle East, we will stand with citizens as they
###2812 demand their universal rights, and support stable transitions
###2816 to democracy.
###2817 (applause)
###2824 We know the process will be messy,
###2829 and we cannot presume to dictate the course of change in
###2832 countries like Egypt, but we can -- and will --
###2835 insist on respect for the fundamental rights of
###2838 all people.
###2840 We'll keep the pressure on a Syrian regime that has murdered
###2843 its own people, and support opposition leaders that respect
###2846 the rights of every Syrian.
###2849 And we will stand steadfast with Israel in pursuit of security
###2853 and a lasting peace.
###2854 (applause)
###2871 These are the messages I'll deliver when I travel to the
###2873 Middle East next month.
###2877 And all this work depends on the courage and sacrifice of those
###2882 who serve in dangerous places at great personal risk --
###2886 our diplomats, our intelligence officers,
###2891 and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces.
###2895 As long as I'm Commander-in-Chief,
###2896 we will do whatever we must to protect those who serve their
###2899 country abroad, and we will maintain the best military the
###2903 world has ever known.
###2905 (applause)
###2919 We'll invest in new capabilities,
###2921 even as we reduce waste and wartime spending.
###2925 We will ensure equal treatment for all servicemembers,
###2928 and equal benefits for their families -- gay and straight.
###2932 (applause)
###2942 We will draw upon the courage and skills of our sisters and
###2946 daughters and moms, because women have proven under fire
###2950 that they are ready for combat.
###2953 We will keep faith with our veterans,
###2955 investing in world-class care, including mental health care,
###2958 for our wounded warriors --
###2960 (applause)
###2974 -- supporting our military families;
###2977 giving our veterans the benefits and education and job
###2979 opportunities that they have earned.
###2981 And I want to thank my wife, Michelle,
###2983 and Dr. Jill Biden for their continued dedication to serving
###2987 our military families as well as they have served us.
###2990 Thank you, honey.
###2992 Thank you, Jill.
###2993 (applause)
###3007 Defending our freedom, though, is not just the job of our
###3011 military alone.
###3013 We must all do our part to make sure our God-given rights are
###3017 protected here at home.
###3020 That includes one of the most fundamental rights of a
###3023 democracy: the right to vote.
###3027 (applause)
###3041 When any American, no matter where they live or what their
###3045 party, are denied that right because they can't afford to
###3051 wait for five or six or seven hours just to cast their ballot,
###3056 we are betraying our ideals.
###3059 (applause)
###3062 So tonight, I'm announcing a nonpartisan commission to
###3070 improve the voting experience in America.
###3073 And it definitely needs improvement.
###3076 I'm asking two long-time experts in the field --
###3080 who, by the way, recently served as the top attorneys for my
###3083 campaign and for Governor Romney's campaign -- to lead it.
###3087 We can fix this, and we will.
###3090 The American people demand it, and so does our democracy.
###3093 (applause)
###3107 Of course, what I've said tonight matters little if we
###3114 don't come together to protect our most precious resource:
###3118 our children.
###3121 It has been two months since Newtown.
###3126 I know this is not the first time this country has debated
###3129 how to reduce gun violence.
###3133 But this time is different.
###3136 Overwhelming majorities of Americans --
###3140 Americans who believe in the Second Amendment --
###3142 have come together around common-sense reform,
###3146 like background checks that will make it harder for criminals to
###3148 get their hands on a gun.
###3150 (applause)
###3156 Senators of both parties are working together on tough new
###3159 laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for resale
###3162 to criminals.
###3165 Police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and
###3168 massive ammunition magazines off our streets,
###3171 because these police chiefs, they're tired of seeing their
###3173 guys and gals being outgunned.
###3179 Each of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress.
###3183 (applause)
###3198 Now, if you want to vote no, that's your choice.
###3203 But these proposals deserve a vote.
###3207 Because in the two months since Newtown,
###3209 more than a thousand birthdays, graduations,
###3213 anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from
###3218 a gun -- more than a thousand.
###3224 One of those we lost was a young girl named Hadiya Pendleton.
###3231 She was 15 years old.
###3234 She loved Fig Newtons and lip gloss.
###3238 She was a majorette.
###3241 She was so good to her friends they all thought they were
###3244 her best friend.
###3247 Just three weeks ago, she was here, in Washington,
###3250 with her classmates, performing for her country at
###3254 my inauguration.
###3256 And a week later, she was shot and killed in a Chicago park
###3260 after school, just a mile away from my house.
###3267 Hadiya's parents, Nate and Cleo, are in this chamber tonight,
###3271 along with more than two dozen Americans whose lives have been
###3275 torn apart by gun violence.
###3278 They deserve a vote.
###3280 (applause)
###3284 They deserve a vote.
###3285 (applause)
###3293 They deserve a vote.
###3294 (applause)
###3304 Gabby Giffords deserves a vote.
###3306 (applause)
###3309 The families of Newtown deserve a vote.
###3311 (applause)
###3313 The families of Aurora deserve a vote.
###3316 (applause)
###3317 The families of Oak Creek and Tucson and Blacksburg,
###3321 and the countless other communities ripped open by gun
###3324 violence -- they deserve a simple vote.
###3326 (applause)
###3335 They deserve a simple vote.
###3341 Our actions will not prevent every senseless act of violence
###3345 in this country.
###3348 In fact, no laws, no initiatives,
###3351 no administrative acts will perfectly solve all the
###3354 challenges I've outlined tonight.
###3358 But we were never sent here to be perfect.
###3363 We were sent here to make what difference we can,
###3367 to secure this nation, expand opportunity,
###3371 uphold our ideals through the hard, often frustrating,
###3375 but absolutely necessary work of self-government.
###3382 We were sent here to look out for our fellow Americans the
###3386 same way they look out for one another, every single day,
###3391 usually without fanfare, all across this country.
###3396 We should follow their example.
###3399 We should follow the example of a New York City nurse named
###3402 Menchu Sanchez.
###3405 When Hurricane Sandy plunged her hospital into darkness,
###3409 she wasn't thinking about how her own home was faring.
###3413 Her mind was on the 20 precious newborns in her care and the
###3417 rescue plan she devised that kept them all safe.
###3423 We should follow the example of a North Miami woman named
###3427 Desiline Victor.
###3430 When Desiline arrived at her polling place,
###3431 she was told the wait to vote might be six hours.
###3434 And as time ticked by, her concern was not with her tired
###3439 body or aching feet, but whether folks like her would get to
###3443 have their say.
###3445 And hour after hour, a throng of people stayed in line to support
###3448 her -- because Desiline is 102 years old.
###3452 (applause)
###3453 And they erupted in cheers when she finally put on a sticker
###3455 that read, "I voted."
###3457 (applause)
###3491 We should follow the example of a police officer named
###3494 Brian Murphy.
###3497 When a gunman opened fire on a Sikh temple in Wisconsin and
###3503 Brian was the first to arrive, he did not consider his
###3505 own safety.
###3508 He fought back until help arrived and ordered his fellow
###3511 officers to protect the safety of the Americans worshiping
###3515 inside, even as he lay bleeding from 12 bullet wounds.
###3520 And when asked how he did that, Brian said,
###3525 "That's just the way we're made."
###3529 That's just the way we're made.
###3533 We may do different jobs and wear different uniforms,
###3538 and hold different views than the person beside us.
###3543 But as Americans, we all share the same proud title --
###3548 we are citizens.
###3551 It's a word that doesn't just describe our nationality or
###3554 legal status.
###3557 It describes the way we're made.
###3560 It describes what we believe.
###3564 It captures the enduring idea that this country only works
###3568 when we accept certain obligations to one another and
###3571 to future generations, that our rights are wrapped up in the
###3575 rights of others; and that well into our third century as a
###3579 nation, it remains the task of us all,
###3583 as citizens of these United States,
###3586 to be the authors of the next great chapter of our
###3589 American story.
###3591 Thank you.
###3592 God bless you, and God bless these United States of America.
###3594 (applause)
