1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:4,71



2
0:0:4,71 --> 0:0:6,8
THOBEY CAMPION: Hey,
this is Thobey.


3
0:0:6,8 --> 0:0:7,88
We're in North Beach, San
Francisco, right now to meet


4
0:0:7,88 --> 0:0:9,71
up with legendary artist,
Winston Smith.


5
0:0:9,71 --> 0:0:25,358



6
0:0:25,358 --> 0:0:26,36
WINSTON SMITH: [INAUDIBLE]
later.


7
0:0:26,36 --> 0:0:26,83
THOBEY CAMPION: Pleasure
to meet you, Thobey.


8
0:0:26,83 --> 0:0:28,298
WINSTON SMITH: Thobey,
good to meet you.


9
0:0:28,298 --> 0:0:29,254
Yeah, that's it.


10
0:0:29,254 --> 0:0:30,688
It's like awesome, two worlds.


11
0:0:30,688 --> 0:0:31,938
THOBEY CAMPION: Thank you.


12
0:0:31,938 --> 0:0:37,86



13
0:0:37,86 --> 0:0:38,94
So this is it?


14
0:0:38,94 --> 0:0:41,48
WINSTON SMITH: Welcome
to Grant's Tomb.


15
0:0:41,48 --> 0:0:43,34
We're right under
Grant Avenue.


16
0:0:43,34 --> 0:0:46,2
So this is mainly my work that
I've had up for a show, and


17
0:0:46,2 --> 0:0:51,39
then I generally pull curtains
across so people don't have to


18
0:0:51,39 --> 0:0:55,93
look at my chaotic
studio part.


19
0:0:55,93 --> 0:0:57,34
I was born in Oklahoma.


20
0:0:57,34 --> 0:1:4,66
Then when I was a teenager, I
had the brilliant idea to go


21
0:1:4,66 --> 0:1:6,73
to art school.


22
0:1:6,73 --> 0:1:11,6
And went to study Renaissance
art in Florence.


23
0:1:11,6 --> 0:1:13,67
My mom's a painter and
a sculptress--


24
0:1:13,67 --> 0:1:14,355
really talented.


25
0:1:14,355 --> 0:1:17,83
And I didn't, unfortunately,
inherit her skills.


26
0:1:17,83 --> 0:1:22,76
I can sketch and draw, if I
wanted to, really well-- but


27
0:1:22,76 --> 0:1:25,34
usually too much effort.


28
0:1:25,34 --> 0:1:27,74
So it's easier to cut
up other people's


29
0:1:27,74 --> 0:1:30,56
drawings and use those.


30
0:1:30,56 --> 0:1:35,16
And I kind of discovered
the medium of collage.


31
0:1:35,16 --> 0:1:37,18
Before there were photocopy
machines, I


32
0:1:37,18 --> 0:1:38,57
would make my own drawings.


33
0:1:38,57 --> 0:1:41,58
And then realized if I cut them
I could mix them together


34
0:1:41,58 --> 0:1:45,9
and come up with really
absurdist compositions that


35
0:1:45,9 --> 0:1:46,68
were startling.


36
0:1:46,68 --> 0:1:51,325
And once I did see a photocopy
machine, I


37
0:1:51,325 --> 0:1:53,16
think Xerox or Olivetti.


38
0:1:53,16 --> 0:1:54,74
In Italy we had Olivetti.


39
0:1:54,74 --> 0:1:56,75
And that kind of changed
everything.


40
0:1:56,75 --> 0:2:0,42
Because you could rearrange
pictures together, photocopy


41
0:2:0,42 --> 0:2:2,81
it, and it would make them
all look like one unit.


42
0:2:2,81 --> 0:2:5,33
At that time, and for a long,
long time afterward, whenever


43
0:2:5,33 --> 0:2:9,8
I would present this work or
composition, especially for


44
0:2:9,8 --> 0:2:12,64
commercial work like
illustration for a magazine,


45
0:2:12,64 --> 0:2:16,6
the art directors would say
well, it's not a painting, and


46
0:2:16,6 --> 0:2:20,89
it's not a photograph,
so what is it?


47
0:2:20,89 --> 0:2:25,1
So I'm trying to create
instant surrealism


48
0:2:25,1 --> 0:2:26,165
that you could get.


49
0:2:26,165 --> 0:2:30,7
I could take a bunch of
completely normal things and


50
0:2:30,7 --> 0:2:32,43
put them together and
they're not right.


51
0:2:32,43 --> 0:2:35,54
The [INAUDIBLE] one time said
you take things that are all


52
0:2:35,54 --> 0:2:38,92
wrong, put them together and
suddenly make them right.


53
0:2:38,92 --> 0:2:41,76
That's a piece we used
for a Dead Kennedy's


54
0:2:41,76 --> 0:2:44,5
record in the middle.


55
0:2:44,5 --> 0:2:47,54
Mowing down the people, it was
on the inside of a record.


56
0:2:47,54 --> 0:2:49,32
THOBEY CAMPION: Do you ever have
brushes with the law or


57
0:2:49,32 --> 0:2:54,13
calls from authorities about
any of your work?


58
0:2:54,13 --> 0:2:57,1
WINSTON SMITH: No I think I'm
either so much under the radar


59
0:2:57,1 --> 0:3:1,6
or they probably figure oh,
let him keep doing that.


60
0:3:1,6 --> 0:3:3,66
That way he won't cause
any real trouble.


61
0:3:3,66 --> 0:3:5,406
He's just an artist.


62
0:3:5,406 --> 0:3:9,28
THOBEY CAMPION: A lot of
articles talk about you coming


63
0:3:9,28 --> 0:3:12,17
back to the States after
being away for six


64
0:3:12,17 --> 0:3:13,35
years or so was a real--


65
0:3:13,35 --> 0:3:14,55
WINSTON SMITH: Culture
shock, yeah.


66
0:3:14,55 --> 0:3:18,2
When I first arrived in America,
I had two friends who


67
0:3:18,2 --> 0:3:20,92
lived here, one who
lived in Boston--


68
0:3:20,92 --> 0:3:23,4
New York and Boston, he moved
to Boston-- and then one


69
0:3:23,4 --> 0:3:26,39
friend who lived out
in San Francisco.


70
0:3:26,39 --> 0:3:28,4
The part of Boston I
lived in was right


71
0:3:28,4 --> 0:3:30,9
by the Charles River.


72
0:3:30,9 --> 0:3:34,51



73
0:3:34,51 --> 0:3:38,24
The shock was that there were
TV cameras everywhere.


74
0:3:38,24 --> 0:3:43,22
Not just at banks and office
buildings, but at donut shops.


75
0:3:43,22 --> 0:3:48,9
And these little cameras would
follow you around.


76
0:3:48,9 --> 0:3:50,45
And like son of a bitch,
it's like Orwell.


77
0:3:50,45 --> 0:3:51,58
THOBEY CAMPION: So you
were in Boston then.


78
0:3:51,58 --> 0:3:54,3
And then how did you get
over to San Francisco?


79
0:3:54,3 --> 0:3:56,9
WINSTON SMITH: I hitchhiked
across the country.


80
0:3:56,9 --> 0:4:1,54
San Francisco was
full of energy.


81
0:4:1,54 --> 0:4:4,11
It's a small city, it's only
seven miles across so you can


82
0:4:4,11 --> 0:4:4,76
walk around.


83
0:4:4,76 --> 0:4:6,73
In fact, there was a bus strike
for a couple of weeks


84
0:4:6,73 --> 0:4:9,6
and I did have to walk around
everywhere to find anything.


85
0:4:9,6 --> 0:4:14,1
Where I would up working was
like a rent a roadie joint


86
0:4:14,1 --> 0:4:18,85
working for different bands like
the Tubes, Crosby, Stills


87
0:4:18,85 --> 0:4:21,61
and Nash, Santana, Journey.


88
0:4:21,61 --> 0:4:24,255
A bunch of other local bands
would come in and perform at


89
0:4:24,255 --> 0:4:26,17
our sound stages.


90
0:4:26,17 --> 0:4:29,22
I did run into lots
of interesting


91
0:4:29,22 --> 0:4:30,66
people in that industry.


92
0:4:30,66 --> 0:4:35,13
And it was right just before
punk rock had begun to rear


93
0:4:35,13 --> 0:4:35,92
its ugly head.


94
0:4:35,92 --> 0:4:38,67
THOBEY CAMPION: So what year
span are we talking right now?


95
0:4:38,67 --> 0:4:40,83
WINSTON SMITH: '76 and '77.


96
0:4:40,83 --> 0:4:43,41
A lot of places wouldn't book
punk bands at that time


97
0:4:43,41 --> 0:4:45,98
because of too much trouble.


98
0:4:45,98 --> 0:4:49,29
The insurance wouldn't cover the
place if the windows got


99
0:4:49,29 --> 0:4:51,16
broken or someone got hurt.


100
0:4:51,16 --> 0:4:54,88
And that's why punk rock,
I think, was born.


101
0:4:54,88 --> 0:4:58,94
Because so many people who
didn't want to perform were


102
0:4:58,94 --> 0:5:2,4
kind of pissed off that all
there was was these giant


103
0:5:2,4 --> 0:5:3,32
stadium bands.


104
0:5:3,32 --> 0:5:6,29
All there was was just big
show business stuff.


105
0:5:6,29 --> 0:5:9,57
And punk rock was about no, just
get up on stage in the


106
0:5:9,57 --> 0:5:13,55
corner of someone's room in
a basement someplace.


107
0:5:13,55 --> 0:5:16,25
San Francisco was more
of an art movement


108
0:5:16,25 --> 0:5:17,5
for the punk scene.


109
0:5:17,5 --> 0:5:20,41
Because there were people who
were artists that couldn't


110
0:5:20,41 --> 0:5:22,68
play anything, but they'd
perform and


111
0:5:22,68 --> 0:5:24,55
they'd have an act.


112
0:5:24,55 --> 0:5:26,76
Usually it was funny or it was
absurd, it was something


113
0:5:26,76 --> 0:5:27,635
interesting.


114
0:5:27,635 --> 0:5:32,4
THOBEY CAMPION: You mentioned in
some interviews about that


115
0:5:32,4 --> 0:5:36,22
time and the spirit that infused
the music and the art


116
0:5:36,22 --> 0:5:38,22
was kind of resemblant
of Dadaism.


117
0:5:38,22 --> 0:5:40,46
WINSTON SMITH: Totally.


118
0:5:40,46 --> 0:5:45,25
Advertising here doesn't take
the form so much of TV ads, or


119
0:5:45,25 --> 0:5:47,84
radio, or billboards--


120
0:5:47,84 --> 0:5:49,13
it's posters.


121
0:5:49,13 --> 0:5:53,84
And we had the opportunity
because people have to walk


122
0:5:53,84 --> 0:6:0,11
around to put posters or
propaganda for a band, or for


123
0:6:0,11 --> 0:6:3,205
anything really, on the walls
that you'd have to see if you


124
0:6:3,205 --> 0:6:4,82
were waiting for the
bus service or


125
0:6:4,82 --> 0:6:6,93
walking down the block.


126
0:6:6,93 --> 0:6:8,56
Sometimes I'd see these
and I'd think


127
0:6:8,56 --> 0:6:13,26
well, I could do that.


128
0:6:13,26 --> 0:6:15,1
I don't think I can do better,
but I could do


129
0:6:15,1 --> 0:6:16,215
something like that.


130
0:6:16,215 --> 0:6:20,22
And I didn't know a lot of the
people in the current scene


131
0:6:20,22 --> 0:6:20,97
that was coming up.


132
0:6:20,97 --> 0:6:22,26
I didn't know people in bands.


133
0:6:22,26 --> 0:6:25,31
So I just made up my own punk
bands and put up posters for


134
0:6:25,31 --> 0:6:27,84
like The Twits--


135
0:6:27,84 --> 0:6:28,805
nonexistent bands.


136
0:6:28,805 --> 0:6:32,34
There was no Kinko's then, you
had to go to the Rexall and


137
0:6:32,34 --> 0:6:33,31
put a dime in the thing.


138
0:6:33,31 --> 0:6:35,9
Or we'd go to the public library
and there's be a


139
0:6:35,9 --> 0:6:38,51
Olivetti machine or
a Xerox machine.


140
0:6:38,51 --> 0:6:43,83
You could do whole
'zines at Rexall.


141
0:6:43,83 --> 0:6:50,14



142
0:6:50,14 --> 0:6:51,53
One of these was--


143
0:6:51,53 --> 0:6:53,99
the people must believe that
they are not manipulated in


144
0:6:53,99 --> 0:6:57,94
order for them to be manipulated
effectively.


145
0:6:57,94 --> 0:7:2,782
That turned into a compilation
album.


146
0:7:2,782 --> 0:7:5,35
THOBEY CAMPION: The name Dead
Kennedys I think inspired how


147
0:7:5,35 --> 0:7:6,835
you first reached
out to Jello?


148
0:7:6,835 --> 0:7:10,3
WINSTON SMITH: We're kind
of at the same age.


149
0:7:10,3 --> 0:7:13,69
He's a few years younger
than me.


150
0:7:13,69 --> 0:7:17,57
So I have a vivid memories of
JFK's assassination as an


151
0:7:17,57 --> 0:7:23,26
11-year-old, as a teenager, and
what that did to the rest


152
0:7:23,26 --> 0:7:26,53
of society.


153
0:7:26,53 --> 0:7:29,27
THOBEY CAMPION: Your career,
there's been points where


154
0:7:29,27 --> 0:7:35,88
people will have reacted to
your work negatively, and


155
0:7:35,88 --> 0:7:37,405
sometimes extremely
negatively.


156
0:7:37,405 --> 0:7:41,12
And I think that the example
that yeah, you pointed across


157
0:7:41,12 --> 0:7:45,42
there, I think that the Pat
Robertson 700 Club instance


158
0:7:45,42 --> 0:7:46,935
was an interesting one.


159
0:7:46,935 --> 0:7:49,7
WINSTON SMITH: We used a picture
I had done a few years


160
0:7:49,7 --> 0:7:52,91
before for a Dead Kennedy's
record, it was an EP.


161
0:7:52,91 --> 0:7:57,9
My piece was a cross of American
dollars with a Jesus


162
0:7:57,9 --> 0:7:58,36
on a cross.


163
0:7:58,36 --> 0:8:4,13
It was about greed and religion
and corruption and


164
0:8:4,13 --> 0:8:5,86
essentially how money
controls things, how


165
0:8:5,86 --> 0:8:6,62
people worship money.


166
0:8:6,62 --> 0:8:9,25
It wasn't really
very profound.


167
0:8:9,25 --> 0:8:11,12
So we used it for the record.


168
0:8:11,12 --> 0:8:15,66
And then in Great Britain they
banned the record cover and


169
0:8:15,66 --> 0:8:19,94
big posters up in the window,
like table-size posters, from


170
0:8:19,94 --> 0:8:20,59
record shops.


171
0:8:20,59 --> 0:8:22,94
Because people complained
because


172
0:8:22,94 --> 0:8:24,91
they said it was heresy.


173
0:8:24,91 --> 0:8:28,52
Which meant they took the
records out of the shops.


174
0:8:28,52 --> 0:8:30,25
And Biafra thought
it was horrible.


175
0:8:30,25 --> 0:8:31,36
This is terrible publicity!


176
0:8:31,36 --> 0:8:33,88
And I was going,
no, it's great!


177
0:8:33,88 --> 0:8:35,32
There's no such thing
as bad publicity!


178
0:8:35,32 --> 0:8:37,96
You should write the
cops a check.


179
0:8:37,96 --> 0:8:40,264
You should send them
a thank you note.


180
0:8:40,264 --> 0:8:43,26
THOBEY CAMPION: Have you always
had a purpose, either


181
0:8:43,26 --> 0:8:45,43
political or social,
with your work?


182
0:8:45,43 --> 0:8:47,46
WINSTON SMITH: No.


183
0:8:47,46 --> 0:8:48,31
THOBEY CAMPION: Thank God.


184
0:8:48,31 --> 0:8:48,94
WINSTON SMITH: Yeah.


185
0:8:48,94 --> 0:8:54,4
Sometimes a lot of things I have
I'll put together because


186
0:8:54,4 --> 0:8:56,29
they look funny, or interesting,
or kind of


187
0:8:56,29 --> 0:8:58,775
intriguing, or enigmatic
that way.


188
0:8:58,775 --> 0:9:2,48
THOBEY CAMPION: Some of your
work has a definite intent.


189
0:9:2,48 --> 0:9:7,37
One of the pieces that gets
brought up a lot is the baby


190
0:9:7,37 --> 0:9:10,166
being fed by the--


191
0:9:10,166 --> 0:9:11,12
WINSTON SMITH: Oh, the bomb.


192
0:9:11,12 --> 0:9:11,6
THOBEY CAMPION: The bomb.


193
0:9:11,6 --> 0:9:12,36
WINSTON SMITH: Baby
and the bomb.


194
0:9:12,36 --> 0:9:13,43
Force-fed war.


195
0:9:13,43 --> 0:9:16,6
That was about when
Ronald Reagan was


196
0:9:16,6 --> 0:9:17,84
President in '82 or '83.


197
0:9:17,84 --> 0:9:21,29
And he cut-off the school lunch
program for children,


198
0:9:21,29 --> 0:9:26,17
which sometimes was the only
meal they had in a day, and


199
0:9:26,17 --> 0:9:27,93
give all the money
to the Pentagon.


200
0:9:27,93 --> 0:9:30,99
The best thing about that rocket
that the baby is being


201
0:9:30,99 --> 0:9:36,53
fed, the real thing on the
tail said 666 DBH or some


202
0:9:36,53 --> 0:9:37,39
other code number.


203
0:9:37,39 --> 0:9:40,54
I just had to blackout the code
number and the 666 was


204
0:9:40,54 --> 0:9:41,885
already there.


205
0:9:41,885 --> 0:9:43,59
THOBEY CAMPION: What
drives you?


206
0:9:43,59 --> 0:9:47,37
Is it frustration that drives
you to continue to be working


207
0:9:47,37 --> 0:9:48,345
like 59 years?


208
0:9:48,345 --> 0:9:51,11
WINSTON SMITH: That actually
is a good motivator.


209
0:9:51,11 --> 0:9:56,88
A lot of it is just the desire
to put what is subconscious


210
0:9:56,88 --> 0:9:58,3
onto paper.


211
0:9:58,3 --> 0:10:3,13
We have a responsibility as
artists to express ourselves.


212
0:10:3,13 --> 0:10:4,74
I think.


213
0:10:4,74 --> 0:10:7,895
Even us, we might change our
mind 10 or 20 years later, and


214
0:10:7,895 --> 0:10:10,2
go oh, you know, I could
be wrong about that.


215
0:10:10,2 --> 0:10:11,27
Now I see it differently.


216
0:10:11,27 --> 0:12:11,27
