5
0:0:17,28 --> 0:0:18,82
LUIS CEDENO: The fact of the
matter is that Chavez has


6
0:0:18,82 --> 0:0:21,275
never spoken about crime
and violence.


7
0:0:21,275 --> 0:0:26,82
To not recognize that crime and
violence is the number one


8
0:0:26,82 --> 0:0:31,43
issue is overlooking a huge
reality of what Venezuelan


9
0:0:31,43 --> 0:0:32,659
people are living today.


10
0:0:32,659 --> 0:0:38,87
Now apparently, at last, the
president has said that crime


11
0:0:38,87 --> 0:0:39,76
is a problem--


12
0:0:39,76 --> 0:0:41,63
after 12, 13 years--


13
0:0:41,63 --> 0:0:45,83
but this time of ours,
too little too late.


14
0:0:45,83 --> 0:0:47,74
RYAN DUFFY: With the government
not addressing the


15
0:0:47,74 --> 0:0:50,92
crime and violence issue until
very recently, local news


16
0:0:50,92 --> 0:0:52,75
reporters have taken
it upon themselves


17
0:0:52,75 --> 0:0:54,36
to educate the public.


18
0:0:54,36 --> 0:0:56,72
Right now we're on our way to
meet Davis Ramirez who's the


19
0:0:56,72 --> 0:0:59,8
local crime reporter
for El Universal.


20
0:0:59,8 --> 0:1:0,49
We're going to tag
along with him on


21
0:1:0,49 --> 0:1:3,97
his beat around Caracas.


22
0:1:3,97 --> 0:1:5,365
DAVIS RAMIREZ MIRANDA:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]


23
0:1:5,365 --> 0:1:45,94



24
0:1:45,94 --> 0:1:47,78
RYAN DUFFY: During our
interview, Davis got a call


25
0:1:47,78 --> 0:1:50,89
about a body that was found
in downtown Caracas bound,


26
0:1:50,89 --> 0:1:52,68
tortured, and decomposing.


27
0:1:52,68 --> 0:1:53,81
We sped off to the scene.


28
0:1:53,81 --> 0:1:55,6
DAVIS RAMIREZ MIRANDA:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]


29
0:1:55,6 --> 0:2:34,83



30
0:2:34,83 --> 0:2:37,18
RYAN DUFFY: In 2008, the year
that crime became the number


31
0:2:37,18 --> 0:2:39,93
one public issue, the government
stopped releasing


32
0:2:39,93 --> 0:2:42,2
official figures
to the public.


33
0:2:42,2 --> 0:2:44,81
Now reporters like Davis are
forced to construct these


34
0:2:44,81 --> 0:2:45,7
numbers on their own.


35
0:2:45,7 --> 0:2:45,798

41
0:4:3,432 --> 0:4:6,64



42
0:4:6,64 --> 0:4:8,88
RYAN DUFFY: After a day of
chasing bodies, we hit another


43
0:4:8,88 --> 0:4:12,3
regular stop on Davis's beat,
Caracas' only morgue.


44
0:4:12,3 --> 0:4:15,55
And the only place to get an
accurate count of the victims.


45
0:4:15,55 --> 0:4:16,305
DAVIS RAMIREZ MIRANDA:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]


46
0:4:16,305 --> 0:4:23,13



47
0:4:23,13 --> 0:4:25,65
RYAN DUFFY: So are this many
journalists here every day?


48
0:4:25,65 --> 0:4:27,7
DAVIS RAMIREZ MIRANDA:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]


49
0:4:27,7 --> 0:4:29,55
RYAN DUFFY: Are there official
government channels that are


50
0:4:29,55 --> 0:4:32,16
here as well, or is it all
opposition coverage?


51
0:4:32,16 --> 0:4:33,41
DAVIS RAMIREZ MIRANDA:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]


52
0:4:33,41 --> 0:4:48,24



53
0:4:48,24 --> 0:4:50,65
RYAN DUFFY: There's kind of this
weird duality to this.


54
0:4:50,65 --> 0:4:52,775
Where on one hand it feels
really uncomfortable and


55
0:4:52,775 --> 0:4:56,47
really predatory, and you're
just standing around waiting


56
0:4:56,47 --> 0:4:58,28
on something terrible
to happen.


57
0:4:58,28 --> 0:5:0,41
On the other hand, it's
information service.


58
0:5:0,41 --> 0:5:3,68
There's no other way to find out
these statistics and the


59
0:5:3,68 --> 0:5:5,64
actual homicide numbers because
the government doesn't


60
0:5:5,64 --> 0:5:6,13
release them.


61
0:5:6,13 --> 0:5:9,85
So there really is no other way
to get this information


62
0:5:9,85 --> 0:5:12,98
than to be here waiting
for people to die.


63
0:5:12,98 --> 0:7:12,98
