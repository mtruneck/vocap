1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:9,196



2
0:0:9,196 --> 0:0:11,2
BEN: Your heart's racing.


3
0:0:11,2 --> 0:0:13,55
Obviously, you're hoping that
we wouldn't get caught.


4
0:0:13,55 --> 0:0:24,5



5
0:0:24,5 --> 0:0:28,28
-There's something about the
hobo that has to be recorded


6
0:0:28,28 --> 0:0:30,626
in American history.


7
0:0:30,626 --> 0:0:33,81
BEN: The whole time we were
asking ourselves, what is the


8
0:0:33,81 --> 0:0:35,22
story here?


9
0:0:35,22 --> 0:0:38,54
What is the story of the hobo?


10
0:0:38,54 --> 0:0:40,67
What is a hobo?


11
0:0:40,67 --> 0:0:41,98
EMPRESS VAGABOND HOBO LUMP: It's
not like people think.


12
0:0:41,98 --> 0:0:45,733
It's hard, like, a hard life.


13
0:0:45,733 --> 0:0:47,146
-It's speeding up!


14
0:0:47,146 --> 0:0:48,792
Go go go go go go!


15
0:0:48,792 --> 0:1:14,212



16
0:1:14,212 --> 0:1:17,194
[APPLAUSE]


17
0:1:17,194 --> 0:1:20,19



18
0:1:20,19 --> 0:1:20,8
AARON SMITH: This
is Britt, Iowa.


19
0:1:20,8 --> 0:1:23,23
It's a small town of about
2,000 people out in the


20
0:1:23,23 --> 0:1:25,6
central Iowa cornfields.


21
0:1:25,6 --> 0:1:27,13
Over the last 112 years,
Britt has become


22
0:1:27,13 --> 0:1:28,84
known for one thing--


23
0:1:28,84 --> 0:1:32,5
an annual event called The
National Hobo Convention.


24
0:1:32,5 --> 0:1:36,52
There's a hobo jungle, a hobo
museum, and a hobo cemetery.


25
0:1:36,52 --> 0:1:39,23
In 1900, Britt was just a newly
incorporated farming


26
0:1:39,23 --> 0:1:41,45
community in search of
migrant workers.


27
0:1:41,45 --> 0:1:43,7
The town founders enticed the
hobos to move their annual


28
0:1:43,7 --> 0:1:45,14
gathering from Chicago
to Britt.


29
0:1:45,14 --> 0:1:48,65



30
0:1:48,65 --> 0:1:50,97
A tradition was born that still
brings self-described


31
0:1:50,97 --> 0:1:53,13
hobos to Britt every year
for one August weekend.


32
0:1:53,13 --> 0:1:56,82



33
0:1:56,82 --> 0:1:59,99
HOBO MIKE: I've been traveling
trains since I was eight, and


34
0:1:59,99 --> 0:2:2,1
as a living since '63.


35
0:2:2,1 --> 0:2:4,61
FROG: I started riding trains
when I was 20 years old.


36
0:2:4,61 --> 0:2:6,27
I'm 62 years old now.


37
0:2:6,27 --> 0:2:7,605
WRONG WAY: [LAUGHING]


38
0:2:7,605 --> 0:2:8,919
I'm Wrong Way.


39
0:2:8,919 --> 0:2:12,75
My nephew gave me that name
in the early '70s.


40
0:2:12,75 --> 0:2:16,3
HOBO SPIKE: I started in 1952,
and I used a train to go from


41
0:2:16,3 --> 0:2:17,7
one place to another
to find work, and


42
0:2:17,7 --> 0:2:19,99
that's how I survived.


43
0:2:19,99 --> 0:2:21,77
AARON SMITH: Most historians
agree the hobo emerged after


44
0:2:21,77 --> 0:2:23,5
the Civil War.


45
0:2:23,5 --> 0:2:25,4
Young men from both sides set
off across the country in


46
0:2:25,4 --> 0:2:26,45
search of work.


47
0:2:26,45 --> 0:2:28,35
By the turn of the century, the
hobo had become part of


48
0:2:28,35 --> 0:2:30,86
the fabric of America.


49
0:2:30,86 --> 0:2:33,59
But today, what was once a
substantial culture and way of


50
0:2:33,59 --> 0:2:35,32
life seems close
to extinction.


51
0:2:35,32 --> 0:2:37,5
We wanted to see what was left
of the hobo community, and we


52
0:2:37,5 --> 0:2:41,37
hoped we'd find it in Britt.


53
0:2:41,37 --> 0:2:43,815
In our minds, there was only one
way to travel to the hobo


54
0:2:43,815 --> 0:2:45,38
convention-- the
freight train.


55
0:2:45,38 --> 0:2:47,53
We began our journey in Oakland,
California, hoping to


56
0:2:47,53 --> 0:2:50,435
travel 1,900 miles on the
rails in five days.


57
0:2:50,435 --> 0:2:56,56



58
0:2:56,56 --> 0:2:57,75
AARON SMITH: These are the maps
that show the different


59
0:2:57,75 --> 0:3:1,52
rail lines all over California,
with like, special


60
0:3:1,52 --> 0:3:5,506
zoom-ins that show you all the
little small towns that you


61
0:3:5,506 --> 0:3:8,922
can stop in, different crew
changes, and this is something


62
0:3:8,922 --> 0:3:10,386
totally like, pre-iPhone.


63
0:3:10,386 --> 0:3:13,802
Now you can totally just
GPS your location.


64
0:3:13,802 --> 0:3:15,28
But these maps were really
helpful for a lot of people


65
0:3:15,28 --> 0:3:17,36
for a long time.


66
0:3:17,36 --> 0:3:19,92
Before a cohesive network of
roads was laid across America,


67
0:3:19,92 --> 0:3:22,62
the train was the fastest way
to get from place to place.


68
0:3:22,62 --> 0:3:25,7
Early hobos learned to ride by
swapping information with


69
0:3:25,7 --> 0:3:27,365
other travelers they met along
the way in hobo jungles.


70
0:3:27,365 --> 0:3:33,81



71
0:3:33,81 --> 0:3:36,18
Chris is from Virginia and
spends his time hopping


72
0:3:36,18 --> 0:3:38,7
freight trains around the
country for pleasure.


73
0:3:38,7 --> 0:3:41,12
Our friend Ben lives in San
Francisco and had a couple


74
0:3:41,12 --> 0:3:43,73
weeks off work and decided
to join us.


75
0:3:43,73 --> 0:3:45,48
BEN: I wasn't sure what
to expect of the trip.


76
0:3:45,48 --> 0:3:48,91
I knew it was going to be an
adventure, but I didn't know


77
0:3:48,91 --> 0:3:52,26
exactly what the details
and the minutiae of


78
0:3:52,26 --> 0:3:53,51
the trip would hold.


79
0:3:53,51 --> 0:4:22,2



80
0:4:22,2 --> 0:4:25,2
We woke up that morning, hoping
to catch a train.


81
0:4:25,2 --> 0:4:28,0
But we woke up, got ready,
there was no train there.


82
0:4:28,0 --> 0:4:30,2
And as more time passed, we
realized that the information


83
0:4:30,2 --> 0:4:32,45
we had gotten was probably
incorrect.


84
0:4:32,45 --> 0:4:37,496



85
0:4:37,496 --> 0:4:40,2
AARON SMITH: We decided to wait
for another train, but a


86
0:4:40,2 --> 0:4:44,75
worker spotted us in the yard
and called the bull.


87
0:4:44,75 --> 0:4:46,9
Bull is an old-time term
for a railroad cop.


88
0:4:46,9 --> 0:4:49,21
It's always been a cat and mouse
game between the hobo


89
0:4:49,21 --> 0:4:49,67
and the bull.


90
0:4:49,67 --> 0:4:51,86
Back in the day, bulls had
no problem killing hobos.


91
0:4:51,86 --> 0:4:53,7
Today, it's a little
bit different.


92
0:4:53,7 --> 0:5:10,75



93
0:5:10,75 --> 0:5:13,5
-We don't really have
hobos anymore.


94
0:5:13,5 --> 0:5:17,15
-A transient, a hobo, vagrant,
is a guy who participates on


95
0:5:17,15 --> 0:5:18,54
the rail property--


96
0:5:18,54 --> 0:5:21,9
trespass, hopping
freights, yeah.


97
0:5:21,9 --> 0:5:22,54
-And a tramp, tramp's in
the middle, right?


98
0:5:22,54 --> 0:5:23,3
-What did they call it?


99
0:5:23,3 --> 0:5:23,655
Tramps.


100
0:5:23,655 --> 0:5:24,45
I like that.


101
0:5:24,45 --> 0:5:25,865
That was back in the day, man.


102
0:5:25,865 --> 0:5:27,8
That was back in the day.


103
0:5:27,8 --> 0:5:28,157
Tramps, hobos.


104
0:5:28,157 --> 0:5:30,666
-When have you seen somebody
with a broomstick--


105
0:5:30,666 --> 0:5:34,98
-A tramp with a bag tied around
his shoulder, right?


106
0:5:34,98 --> 0:5:35,68
All right, guys.


107
0:5:35,68 --> 0:5:37,89
You know how to get out
of here, right?


108
0:5:37,89 --> 0:5:40,41
Don't come back, all right?


109
0:5:40,41 --> 0:5:41,636
-Don't come back.


110
0:5:41,636 --> 0:5:43,31
AARON SMITH: There seem
to be very few people


111
0:5:43,31 --> 0:5:44,83
hopping trains anymore.


112
0:5:44,83 --> 0:5:47,2
The hobo seems like
a museum piece.


113
0:5:47,2 --> 0:5:49,86
It's like a joke, a word
nobody uses anymore.


114
0:5:49,86 --> 0:5:52,69
We didn't want to go to the
Oakland jail, so we headed to


115
0:5:52,69 --> 0:5:55,57
Amtrak station with our tails
between our legs.


116
0:5:55,57 --> 0:5:57,83
We got out to the next crew
change stop on the line--


117
0:5:57,83 --> 0:5:59,8
Roseville, California.


118
0:5:59,8 --> 0:6:2,15



119
0:6:2,15 --> 0:6:3,9
As soon as we got to Roseville,
there was a train


120
0:6:3,9 --> 0:6:5,16
getting ready to take off.


121
0:6:5,16 --> 0:6:26,9



122
0:6:26,9 --> 0:6:28,7
Bad decision.


123
0:6:28,7 --> 0:6:30,43
A conductor saw us and we got
pulled off the train five


124
0:6:30,43 --> 0:6:33,96
miles outside of town.


125
0:6:33,96 --> 0:6:35,59
Uh, we just got pulled
off this train here.


126
0:6:35,59 --> 0:6:36,35
-Again.


127
0:6:36,35 --> 0:6:38,26
AARON SMITH: Yeah, yeah, it
was the second time today.


128
0:6:38,26 --> 0:6:39,72
Morale was low.


129
0:6:39,72 --> 0:6:42,36
Chris decided to set off on
his own to Denver, and we


130
0:6:42,36 --> 0:6:44,34
hopped a gambling bus
to Reno, Nevada.


131
0:6:44,34 --> 0:6:57,28



132
0:6:57,28 --> 0:6:59,72
JACKSON FAGER: Now we're in
Reno, Nevada, feeling a little


133
0:6:59,72 --> 0:7:2,292
better about our situation, and
hoping a train comes in


134
0:7:2,292 --> 0:7:3,542
the next couple hours.


135
0:7:3,542 --> 0:7:6,4



136
0:7:6,4 --> 0:7:7,825
AARON SMITH: In the yard,
avoiding bulls and workers is


137
0:7:7,825 --> 0:7:8,72
one concern.


138
0:7:8,72 --> 0:7:10,47
Finding a rideable
car is another.


139
0:7:10,47 --> 0:7:12,58
Some of the wells on these
double-stacked cars have a


140
0:7:12,58 --> 0:7:13,73
cubby hole you can
ride in, but we


141
0:7:13,73 --> 0:7:14,98
weren't seeing anything.


142
0:7:14,98 --> 0:7:18,56



143
0:7:18,56 --> 0:7:21,1
The locomotive at the back of
the train, called the rear


144
0:7:21,1 --> 0:7:22,89
unit, seemed like
our best bet.


145
0:7:22,89 --> 0:7:23,91
But it's risky.


146
0:7:23,91 --> 0:7:25,41
Workers periodically
check the cars.


147
0:7:25,41 --> 0:7:34,44



148
0:7:34,44 --> 0:7:36,54
Lucky for us, the train
aired up, and we


149
0:7:36,54 --> 0:7:37,79
finally got on our way.


150
0:7:37,79 --> 0:7:43,44



151
0:7:43,44 --> 0:7:47,63
We're indoors, Amtrak style, and
we've got these big plushy


152
0:7:47,63 --> 0:7:49,42
seats, continuing along.


153
0:7:49,42 --> 0:8:6,94



154
0:8:6,94 --> 0:8:9,25
We're in the middle
of nowhere.


155
0:8:9,25 --> 0:8:13,11
For the first 100 miles,
there were no roads, no


156
0:8:13,11 --> 0:8:14,18
highways, no nothing.


157
0:8:14,18 --> 0:8:17,56
It was just desert as far
as the eye could see.


158
0:8:17,56 --> 0:8:18,16
It was beautiful.


159
0:8:18,16 --> 0:8:21,21
It was amazing to kind of get
that, see what that was like,


160
0:8:21,21 --> 0:8:22,786
vast expanses of nature.


161
0:8:22,786 --> 0:9:14,1



162
0:9:14,1 --> 0:9:16,71
MEDICINE MAN: Now, everybody
thinks that the real hobo life


163
0:9:16,71 --> 0:9:24,762
is great, and it's part of
wanderlust, but it's not.


164
0:9:24,762 --> 0:9:27,63
The hobo life is a very,
very dangerous life.


165
0:9:27,63 --> 0:9:33,9
ADMAN: Sometimes painful, when
everything is all fucked up.


166
0:9:33,9 --> 0:9:37,99
You're looking around, and
the bulls are out there.


167
0:9:37,99 --> 0:9:40,92
BEN: It felt like something out
of a special operations


168
0:9:40,92 --> 0:9:42,17
combat mission.


169
0:9:42,17 --> 0:9:46,47



170
0:9:46,47 --> 0:9:47,94
We spotted a grain train.


171
0:9:47,94 --> 0:9:50,457
We knew that this was our
ticket out of Elko.


172
0:9:50,457 --> 0:9:52,68
Go go go go go!


173
0:9:52,68 --> 0:10:17,175



174
0:10:17,175 --> 0:10:23,2
ADMAN: Riding on a flat car with
a full moon, and watching


175
0:10:23,2 --> 0:10:30,605
the [CLICKING NOISE]


176
0:10:30,605 --> 0:10:32,95
It's a game that gives you
a fucking hard-on, I


177
0:10:32,95 --> 0:10:34,2
can tell you that.


178
0:10:34,2 --> 0:10:45,4



179
0:10:45,4 --> 0:10:47,32
MINNESOTA JIM: Once you
do it, it's with you


180
0:10:47,32 --> 0:10:48,98
the rest your life.


181
0:10:48,98 --> 0:10:51,337
You want to keep on the move.


182
0:10:51,337 --> 0:10:57,54



183
0:10:57,54 --> 0:11:0,5
ADMAN: We see the world
in a different light.


184
0:11:0,5 --> 0:11:7,251



185
0:11:7,251 --> 0:11:14,45
FROG: Always total, absolute
freedom, every day of my life.


186
0:11:14,45 --> 0:11:15,74
HOBO SPIKE: I don't think
there's any better way to see


187
0:11:15,74 --> 0:11:18,5
this great world of ours,
especially our nation, than


188
0:11:18,5 --> 0:11:19,559
from a freight train.


189
0:11:19,559 --> 0:11:24,549



190
0:11:24,549 --> 0:11:26,87
AARON SMITH: We were crossing
the Great Salt Lake.


191
0:11:26,87 --> 0:11:28,64
The air was cool, and
the smell of sulfur


192
0:11:28,64 --> 0:11:29,62
rose from the water.


193
0:11:29,62 --> 0:11:32,6
It was the most undisturbed
stretch of natural beauty any


194
0:11:32,6 --> 0:11:33,85
of us had ever seen.


195
0:11:33,85 --> 0:11:35,98



196
0:11:35,98 --> 0:11:39,1
The train forces you to slow
down and take it all in.


197
0:11:39,1 --> 0:11:41,37
All the frustrations and
anxieties of life back in


198
0:11:41,37 --> 0:11:42,9
civilization seemed
to disappear.


199
0:11:42,9 --> 0:11:49,995



200
0:11:49,995 --> 0:11:51,76
HOBO SPIKE: When you're on the
rails, if you don't get


201
0:11:51,76 --> 0:11:54,75
caught, there's no one to tell
you what to do, when to go to


202
0:11:54,75 --> 0:11:56,6
bed, when to get up,
what to eat.


203
0:11:56,6 --> 0:11:57,616
You're on your own for 100%.


204
0:11:57,616 --> 0:11:59,34
AARON SMITH: Although we were
loving the ride, we were


205
0:11:59,34 --> 0:12:1,19
running out of water fast.


206
0:12:1,19 --> 0:12:4,32
After close to 24 hours on the
train, we were hungry, tired,


207
0:12:4,32 --> 0:12:5,57
dirty, and dehydrated.


208
0:12:5,57 --> 0:12:8,89



209
0:12:8,89 --> 0:12:12,656
Well, our train stopped here
in Green River, Wyoming.


210
0:12:12,656 --> 0:12:16,747
It's just a little railroad town
here in southern Wyoming.


211
0:12:16,747 --> 0:12:19,876
Just kind of roamed around and
got the vibe of the town.


212
0:12:19,876 --> 0:12:21,8
HOBO SPIKE: Then when you get
into a community, of course


213
0:12:21,8 --> 0:12:25,64
you have to fit into society,
so you have to abide by laws


214
0:12:25,64 --> 0:12:26,16
at that time.


215
0:12:26,16 --> 0:12:28,24
But if you're by yourself,
you don't have to pay


216
0:12:28,24 --> 0:12:30,4
attention to any law.


217
0:12:30,4 --> 0:12:32,32
AARON SMITH: So we walked over
this bridge that we're sitting


218
0:12:32,32 --> 0:12:36,4
under now, probably about
110 degrees, dry heat.


219
0:12:36,4 --> 0:12:38,59
BEN: Just took a dip
in the Green River.


220
0:12:38,59 --> 0:12:43,78
After four or five days not
showering, it felt amazing.


221
0:12:43,78 --> 0:12:47,46
AARON SMITH: I'm gonna go
get in there right now.


222
0:12:47,46 --> 0:12:49,0
BEN: Our days have
been very full.


223
0:12:49,0 --> 0:12:50,59
We haven't gotten
a lot of sleep.


224
0:12:50,59 --> 0:12:54,24
It's been a few hours here, a
few hours there, trying to hop


225
0:12:54,24 --> 0:12:57,13
on trains successfully,
which we sometimes


226
0:12:57,13 --> 0:12:59,1
have, sometimes haven't.


227
0:12:59,1 --> 0:13:1,28
We're always on the move trying
to get to our end goal,


228
0:13:1,28 --> 0:13:4,196
which is Britt.


229
0:13:4,196 --> 0:13:6,96
AARON SMITH: No eastbound trains
were coming through.


230
0:13:6,96 --> 0:13:9,4
The sun went down, and we
enjoyed the solitude of the


231
0:13:9,4 --> 0:13:10,565
Wyoming landscape.


232
0:13:10,565 --> 0:13:12,865
Up to this point, we hadn't seen
any other travelers on


233
0:13:12,865 --> 0:13:14,115
the trains.


234
0:13:14,115 --> 0:13:16,39



235
0:13:16,39 --> 0:13:18,62
At the turn of the century,
there were around a million


236
0:13:18,62 --> 0:13:20,28
hobos on the rails.


237
0:13:20,28 --> 0:13:21,93
After the Depression,
that number doubled.


238
0:13:21,93 --> 0:13:24,81
Hobos had organized their own
union, and there were over 60


239
0:13:24,81 --> 0:13:26,95
hobo colleges all across
the country.


240
0:13:26,95 --> 0:13:29,45
Boxcars were crowded
with riders.


241
0:13:29,45 --> 0:13:31,73
But something happened midway
through the century.


242
0:13:31,73 --> 0:13:33,82
Maybe it was American
prosperity.


243
0:13:33,82 --> 0:13:35,96
Where there were once millions
on the road, today, there's


244
0:13:35,96 --> 0:13:37,65
probably a couple thousand.


245
0:13:37,65 --> 0:13:40,1
In my experience, you hardly
ever see anyone on the rails.


246
0:13:40,1 --> 0:13:45,53



247
0:13:45,53 --> 0:13:47,69
The next morning, we decided to
try our luck in the Green


248
0:13:47,69 --> 0:13:48,94
River yard.


249
0:13:48,94 --> 0:13:51,43



250
0:13:51,43 --> 0:13:52,27
-Hey, man.


251
0:13:52,27 --> 0:13:53,52
-How about yourself?


252
0:13:53,52 --> 0:13:58,75



253
0:13:58,75 --> 0:14:0,0
-We're hitchhiking.


254
0:14:0,0 --> 0:14:4,63



255
0:14:4,63 --> 0:14:5,88
-Sorry, man.


256
0:14:5,88 --> 0:14:8,23



257
0:14:8,23 --> 0:14:11,45
-Oh, really?


258
0:14:11,45 --> 0:14:12,295
-All right, thank you.


259
0:14:12,295 --> 0:14:14,53



260
0:14:14,53 --> 0:14:15,74
-OK, man.


261
0:14:15,74 --> 0:14:18,675
-Thank you.


262
0:14:18,675 --> 0:14:20,86
AARON SMITH: After getting
warned by the cops to leave,


263
0:14:20,86 --> 0:14:23,214
we went back to our original
spot under the bridge.


264
0:14:23,214 --> 0:14:30,95



265
0:14:30,95 --> 0:14:33,285
MEDICINE MAN: Today, you don't
want to jump a train.


266
0:14:33,285 --> 0:14:36,31
It's so dangerous, because the
old steam locomotives, it was


267
0:14:36,31 --> 0:14:38,99
chug, chug, chug, and pretty
soon, it was [ENGINE NOISE].


268
0:14:38,99 --> 0:14:41,34
But today, in two minutes,
they're flying.


269
0:14:41,34 --> 0:14:52,54



270
0:14:52,54 --> 0:14:54,41
AARON SMITH: Our train stopped
in the middle of the yard, and


271
0:14:54,41 --> 0:14:55,66
we didn't know why.


272
0:14:55,66 --> 0:15:0,937



273
0:15:0,937 --> 0:15:3,25
AARON SMITH: An hour went by,
and it felt like an eternity.


274
0:15:3,25 --> 0:15:12,55



275
0:15:12,55 --> 0:15:13,7
Each time you get on
the train, it's


276
0:15:13,7 --> 0:15:14,73
a role of the die--


277
0:15:14,73 --> 0:15:16,94
a unique and unpredictable
experience.


278
0:15:16,94 --> 0:15:18,46
Perhaps that's one
reason we do it--


279
0:15:18,46 --> 0:15:21,11
to gamble, to relinquish control
completely, and give


280
0:15:21,11 --> 0:15:22,738
ourselves to fate and luck.


281
0:15:22,738 --> 0:15:29,92



282
0:15:29,92 --> 0:15:31,736
That was one of the faster
ones I've hopped on.


283
0:15:31,736 --> 0:15:34,5
You kind of had to run alongside
and kind of throw


284
0:15:34,5 --> 0:15:34,83
yourself up.


285
0:15:34,83 --> 0:15:35,9
But we all made it.


286
0:15:35,9 --> 0:15:37,9
Really grateful for that.


287
0:15:37,9 --> 0:15:43,4



288
0:15:43,4 --> 0:15:45,63
The train out of Green River
had three units and looked


289
0:15:45,63 --> 0:15:48,75
like it would blaze across
Wyoming, but it puttered along


290
0:15:48,75 --> 0:15:51,96
the entire time at
35 miles an hour.


291
0:15:51,96 --> 0:15:55,64
It was time for a
change of plans.


292
0:15:55,64 --> 0:15:58,33
We arrived in Laramie, Wyoming
on Friday morning, with still


293
0:15:58,33 --> 0:16:0,45
800 miles to go to
get to Britt.


294
0:16:0,45 --> 0:16:1,74
We were behind schedule,
and the


295
0:16:1,74 --> 0:16:3,21
convention had already started.


296
0:16:3,21 --> 0:16:5,45
We got off here in Laramie,
Wyoming because the train was


297
0:16:5,45 --> 0:16:7,41
so damn slow.


298
0:16:7,41 --> 0:16:9,64
Rent a cars were too expensive,
the Greyhound would


299
0:16:9,64 --> 0:16:13,71
take two days, so we ended
up getting this U-Haul.


300
0:16:13,71 --> 0:16:16,3
12-hour drive ahead of us, and
we've gotta haul ass to Britt.


301
0:16:16,3 --> 0:16:19,9



302
0:16:19,9 --> 0:16:21,285
In keeping with the spirit of
our trip, we picked up all the


303
0:16:21,285 --> 0:16:24,25
hitchhikers we saw
along the way.


304
0:16:24,25 --> 0:16:26,3
JOE YOUNG: Hey, what's
up, guys?


305
0:16:26,3 --> 0:16:27,58
I'm Joe Young.


306
0:16:27,58 --> 0:16:30,88
I've been on the road for about
four or five years.


307
0:16:30,88 --> 0:16:33,876
The only way I get around
is on bicycle.


308
0:16:33,876 --> 0:16:36,83



309
0:16:36,83 --> 0:16:37,76
AARON SMITH: We picked
up another guy.


310
0:16:37,76 --> 0:16:38,575
This is Alex.


311
0:16:38,575 --> 0:16:39,918
He's coming from Colorado.


312
0:16:39,918 --> 0:16:41,22
ALEX: How's it going?


313
0:16:41,22 --> 0:16:42,835
AARON SMITH: It didn't take us
long to fill up the back of


314
0:16:42,835 --> 0:16:44,85
the U-Haul.


315
0:16:44,85 --> 0:16:50,42



316
0:16:50,42 --> 0:16:52,43
After six grueling days
of traveling, we


317
0:16:52,43 --> 0:16:53,54
finally arrived in Brit.


318
0:16:53,54 --> 0:16:56,81
We were ready to hang out with
hundreds of hobos and swap


319
0:16:56,81 --> 0:16:58,941
stories about our travels
on the rails.


320
0:16:58,941 --> 0:16:59,402
-Hello!


321
0:16:59,402 --> 0:17:0,785
Happy Hobo Days!


322
0:17:0,785 --> 0:17:4,99



323
0:17:4,99 --> 0:17:5,95
-Happy Hobo Days!


324
0:17:5,95 --> 0:17:8,55
-What we found instead was a
family-friendly event with a


325
0:17:8,55 --> 0:17:10,79
bunch of tourists.


326
0:17:10,79 --> 0:17:12,839
BEN: Just a number of
townspeople, big farm


327
0:17:12,839 --> 0:17:17,67
tractors, fancy or unusual cars,
and homemade floats.


328
0:17:17,67 --> 0:17:19,1
People-- not hobos.


329
0:17:19,1 --> 0:17:19,78
-All aboard!


330
0:17:19,78 --> 0:17:25,5
-The hobo convention has gone
county fair mainstream.


331
0:17:25,5 --> 0:17:28,69
This wasn't the wild, drunken,
turn of the century event that


332
0:17:28,69 --> 0:17:31,756
brought 1,800 hobos
here in the 1940s.


333
0:17:31,756 --> 0:17:35,3
-Well, we're serving mulligan
stew, and it is what the


334
0:17:35,3 --> 0:17:37,22
traditional hobo
used to serve.


335
0:17:37,22 --> 0:17:40,69
Meat-- we have pork in ours--
and then it has beef


336
0:17:40,69 --> 0:17:42,9
flavoring, and pork flavoring,
and then vegetables, barley,


337
0:17:42,9 --> 0:17:45,97
and rice in it, and
then water.


338
0:17:45,97 --> 0:17:48,89
-Every year for the past 112
years, the hobos have elected


339
0:17:48,89 --> 0:17:52,5
a hobo king and queen.


340
0:17:52,5 --> 0:17:57,149
-This year, our new
queen is Angel.


341
0:17:57,149 --> 0:18:0,558
And your new king is
Minnesota Jim.


342
0:18:0,558 --> 0:18:4,69



343
0:18:4,69 --> 0:18:7,27
-It's an important moment for
them, especially now that most


344
0:18:7,27 --> 0:18:8,71
of the hobos are senior
citizens.


345
0:18:8,71 --> 0:18:17,88



346
0:18:17,88 --> 0:18:20,6
The hobo jungle in Britt is a
well maintained park on the


347
0:18:20,6 --> 0:18:21,42
edge of town.


348
0:18:21,42 --> 0:18:23,23
It used to be a pretty
wild place.


349
0:18:23,23 --> 0:18:24,39
EMPRESS VAGABOND HOBO LUMP:
This is not the same.


350
0:18:24,39 --> 0:18:29,41
They bring in like a family
affair, and a history thing,


351
0:18:29,41 --> 0:18:30,91
and people learning.


352
0:18:30,91 --> 0:18:33,93
Because the hobo, you wouldn't
be finding no children in an


353
0:18:33,93 --> 0:18:37,27
old camp, you know
what I mean?


354
0:18:37,27 --> 0:18:40,41
People really was kind of
sleeping out, and across the


355
0:18:40,41 --> 0:18:41,92
tracks or in the bush.


356
0:18:41,92 --> 0:18:43,52
It was more like a jungle.


357
0:18:43,52 --> 0:18:48,244



358
0:18:48,244 --> 0:18:50,9
AARON SMITH: Today, there's
a lot of rules.


359
0:18:50,9 --> 0:18:54,8
No drinking, no drugs,
no unleashed dogs.


360
0:18:54,8 --> 0:18:56,165
It's become the kind of place
that people used to become


361
0:18:56,165 --> 0:18:57,415
hobos to get away from.


362
0:18:57,415 --> 0:19:2,7



363
0:19:2,7 --> 0:19:4,99
Most of the hobos we met were
retired from riding trains.


364
0:19:4,99 --> 0:19:8,64
Living an itinerant life for
decades takes its toll.


365
0:19:8,64 --> 0:19:11,92
MEDICINE MAN: A modern-day
hobo, probably in my


366
0:19:11,92 --> 0:19:14,21
estimation, is getting to the
point where it's rubber tire


367
0:19:14,21 --> 0:19:19,28
hobos that come together
and perpetuate history.


368
0:19:19,28 --> 0:19:21,31
AARON SMITH: The convention
has become a shadow of its


369
0:19:21,31 --> 0:19:22,73
former self.


370
0:19:22,73 --> 0:19:25,18
The city's turned it
into a parody.


371
0:19:25,18 --> 0:19:27,4
There are still plenty young
people out there riding the


372
0:19:27,4 --> 0:19:30,11
rails for adventure, but those
who call themselves hobos and


373
0:19:30,11 --> 0:19:32,27
travel around looking for
work are a dying breed.


374
0:19:32,27 --> 0:19:34,3
FROG: And it's still there.


375
0:19:34,3 --> 0:19:36,79
Though I'm not riding freight
trains, it's still there.


376
0:19:36,79 --> 0:19:38,4
I still want to ride.


377
0:19:38,4 --> 0:19:42,97



378
0:19:42,97 --> 0:19:46,2
AARON SMITH: Out on the rails,
we slowed down and experienced


379
0:19:46,2 --> 0:19:47,65
an adventure that was
once a way of life


380
0:19:47,65 --> 0:19:49,41
for a lot of people.


381
0:19:49,41 --> 0:19:52,82
The train tracks persist on,
relics on the landscape, entry


382
0:19:52,82 --> 0:19:54,44
points into the hidden world.


383
0:19:54,44 --> 0:19:58,1
We felt a deep nostalgia for a
time that's passed and sadness


384
0:19:58,1 --> 0:20:0,76
for the American hobo, fast
disappearing down the


385
0:20:0,76 --> 0:20:2,75
westbound track.


386
0:20:2,75 --> 0:20:6,81
FROG: I have one final ride, and
it's my westbound journey.


387
0:20:6,81 --> 0:20:12,81
-For the moments of happiness,
for the love, for the moments


388
0:20:12,81 --> 0:20:19,33
of disappointments, for
everything, hobo is thankful


389
0:20:19,33 --> 0:20:20,58
to the railroad.


390
0:20:20,58 --> 0:22:20,58
