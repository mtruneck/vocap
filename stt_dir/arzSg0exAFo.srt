CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: As we kick off this
Tuesday edition of CNN STUDENT NEWS, we are


2
0:0:16,55 --> 0:0:21,289
going to take off reporting on a trip of the
new U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. This


3
0:0:21,289 --> 0:0:25,859
is his first trip overseas since he became
secretary. And that kind of travel is something


4
0:0:25,859 --> 0:0:30,149
Kerry can expect a lot of: visiting other
countries and working with their leaders is


5
0:0:30,149 --> 0:0:34,48
one of the biggest parts of his new job. The
Secretary of State is the president`s top


6
0:0:34,48 --> 0:0:39,379
advisor on foreign policy. The president comes
up with his own policies when it comes to


7
0:0:39,379 --> 0:0:44,379
how the U.S. interacts with other nations,
then it`s the secretary`s responsibility to


8
0:0:44,379 --> 0:0:45,8
carry those policies out.

10
0:0:46,89 --> 0:0:49,85
JOHN KERRY, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: In today`s
global world, there is no longer anything


11
0:0:49,85 --> 0:0:56,819
foreign about foreign policy. More than every
before, the decisions that we make from the


12
0:0:56,819 --> 0:1:3,37
safety of our shores don`t just ripple outward.
They also create a current right here, in


13
0:1:3,37 --> 0:1:3,489
America.


14
0:1:3,489 --> 0:1:3,879
(END VIDEO CLIP)


15
0:1:3,879 --> 0:1:8,2
AZUZ: Secretary Kerry will probably take a
lot of trips to other countries, but this


16
0:1:8,2 --> 0:1:9,87
one is getting some deeper attention.


17
0:1:9,87 --> 0:1:10,11
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


18
0:1:10,11 --> 0:1:12,25
NICHOLAS BURNS, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:
First trips by an American Secretary of State


19
0:1:12,25 --> 0:1:16,75
overseas are watched very closely. There`s
a lot of symbolism attached to them. People


20
0:1:16,75 --> 0:1:19,7
look for clues as to which region is most
important for the United States.


21
0:1:19,7 --> 0:1:19,93
(END VIDEO CLIP)


22
0:1:19,93 --> 0:1:24,45
AZUZ: The last Secretary of State, Hillary
Clinton headed east for her first trip. Experts


23
0:1:24,45 --> 0:1:29,92
say that showed President Obama`s focus on
Asia. Secretary Kerry is heading to nine countries


24
0:1:29,92 --> 0:1:36,859
on his eleven day trip: England, Germany,
France, Italy, Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia,


25
0:1:36,859 --> 0:1:41,549
the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. In Europe,
he`ll be talking with America`s traditional


26
0:1:41,549 --> 0:1:46,85
allies, he`ll also be rallying their support
in the ongoing dispute over Iran`s controversial


27
0:1:46,85 --> 0:1:52,3
nuclear program. And for any next steps to
help the opposition groups fighting the Syrian


28
0:1:52,3 --> 0:1:53,979
government.


29
0:1:53,979 --> 0:1:58,6
Sometimes severe weather alerts can be a little
confusing. Is a watch worse than a warning?


30
0:1:58,6 --> 0:2:3,759
How serious is an advisory? Well, National
Weather Service`s message in Amarillo, Texas


31
0:2:3,759 --> 0:2:9,259
yesterday was pretty clear.


32
0:2:9,259 --> 0:2:14,3
Do not travel. All caps. You could see why.
A blizzard, one that the weather service called


33
0:2:14,3 --> 0:2:19,16
historic, hit the Texas panhandle. This thing
was dropping snow at a rate of two to three


34
0:2:19,16 --> 0:2:23,98
inches per hour. Officials said, nearly all
the roads in the panhandle were impossible.


35
0:2:23,98 --> 0:2:29,5
The National Guard was being called out to
help drivers who got stranded. Even snow plows


36
0:2:29,5 --> 0:2:33,64
had to be pulled off the roads because of
whiteout conditions in Texas and Oklahoma.


37
0:2:33,64 --> 0:2:40,32
A whiteout is a blizzard that you just can`t
see through. Driving in one, incredibly dangerous.


38
0:2:40,32 --> 0:2:44,25
Yesterday we talked about homeless man who
returned a woman`s diamond ring that she accidentally


39
0:2:44,25 --> 0:2:48,95
dropped in his collection cup. Quick reaction
on that from our blog: Chandler says, "The


40
0:2:48,95 --> 0:2:53,76
value is on what`s important. It`s the significance
of the object. I wouldn`t return $100 bill,


41
0:2:53,76 --> 0:2:58,61
but I would look for the owner of a cell phone
despite it being worth $40."


42
0:2:58,61 --> 0:3:2,73
Patrick would keep whatever he found, "even
if giving it back is generous, I still have


43
0:3:2,73 --> 0:3:5,32
to support my life and survive."


44
0:3:5,32 --> 0:3:8,92
Serenity says, you never know what something
means to someone. "I would try to return a


45
0:3:8,92 --> 0:3:13,9
piece of jewelry, but if it`s a $10 bill,
there`s little chance of finding a legit owner."


46
0:3:13,9 --> 0:3:18,11
Teachers, we want to hear from you, too. It`s
cnnstudentnews.com. Please, take a moment


47
0:3:18,11 --> 0:3:20,84
to tell us what you thought of today`s show.


48
0:3:20,84 --> 0:3:26,34
February 26th 2012, exactly one year ago,
two strangers met in Sanford, Florida. One


49
0:3:26,34 --> 0:3:30,88
died that night, the other is on trial for
second degree murder. What happened caused


50
0:3:30,88 --> 0:3:36,29
outrage on both sides and led the protests
across the country. Trayvon Martin was 17.


51
0:3:36,29 --> 0:3:41,29
He was walking home from a convenience store.
He was unarmed. George Zimmerman was 29. He


52
0:3:41,29 --> 0:3:46,57
was a neighborhood watch captain, he was carrying
a gun. We know there was some kind of confrontation


53
0:3:46,57 --> 0:3:51,11
between them, and we know that Zimmerman shot
and killed Martin. Attorneys for Martin`s


54
0:3:51,11 --> 0:3:57,18
family say he was racially profiled and shot
"in cold blood".. Zimmerman said he shot in


55
0:3:57,18 --> 0:4:1,83
self-defense after Martin attacked him. When
police were called out to the scene, they


56
0:4:1,83 --> 0:4:6,93
did not arrest Zimmerman, they said they didn`t
have enough evidence to disproof his story.


57
0:4:6,93 --> 0:4:11,79
As news of the incident spread, people held
rallies and protests across the country. Eventually,


58
0:4:11,79 --> 0:4:16,479
Zimmerman was arrested and charged with second
degree murder. The cases don`t go to trial


59
0:4:16,479 --> 0:4:20,88
immediately. His lawyers are building their
defense right now as prosecutors plan their


60
0:4:20,88 --> 0:4:26,15
legal strategy. The trial, the state of Florida
versus George Zimmerman is scheduled to start


61
0:4:26,15 --> 0:4:27,1
in June.

63
0:4:28,53 --> 0:4:33,28
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes
out to Mr. Ball`s young adult class at Liberty


64
0:4:33,28 --> 0:4:39,63
School in Saline, Michigan. What part of a
plant produced pollen? You know what to do.


65
0:4:39,63 --> 0:4:52,59
So, it the anther, petal, pistil or sepal?
You`ve got three seconds, go!


66
0:4:52,59 --> 0:4:56,82
Those pollen grains that could wreak havoc
on allergies are produced in the anther. The


67
0:4:56,82 --> 0:5:2,8
male part of the plant. That`s your answer
and that`s your "Shoutout"


68
0:5:2,8 --> 0:5:3,69
(END VIDEO CLIP)


69
0:5:3,69 --> 0:5:9,41
AZUZ: Whether or not you believe in the perfunctory
prognostications of Punxsutawney Phil who


70
0:5:9,41 --> 0:5:13,79
said spring is coming early this year, there`s
something in the air we can count on every


71
0:5:13,79 --> 0:5:21,57
year. Yes, pollen as in excuse (ph) me while
I sneeze again. You can blame men for this


72
0:5:21,57 --> 0:5:26,31
one, at least the male components of plants.
They produce countless grains of the stuff


73
0:5:26,31 --> 0:5:31,9
that fertilizes other plants, but also sometimes
winds up planted in our nooses. Here is the


74
0:5:31,9 --> 0:5:37,38
fun part: and by fun I mean terrible: in some
parts of the U.S. pollen sneezing is staring


75
0:5:37,38 --> 0:5:42,8
early this year. Tree pollen is supposed to
pick in March, grass pollen in the following


76
0:5:42,8 --> 0:5:47,21
weeks, but regions from the nation`s capital
to north Texas saw pollen counts spike in


77
0:5:47,21 --> 0:5:52,83
February. What does that mean? Well researchers
count the number of pollen grains in a cubic


78
0:5:52,83 --> 0:5:59,37
meter of air. A count of 120 or more is considered
"high", but in recent years, the south east


79
0:5:59,37 --> 0:6:3,68
has seen counts in the thousands. If you are
not allergic, you`ll notice the pollen on


80
0:6:3,68 --> 0:6:9,28
your yellow car, which didn`t start out yellow.
If you are allergic, you`ll know by the coughing,


81
0:6:9,28 --> 0:6:14,11
sneezing wheezing, sniffling, allergic suffering
that pollen brings you. The worst times for


82
0:6:14,11 --> 0:6:19,37
pollen are dawn and dusk, so you want to try
to be indoors then. The best - right after


83
0:6:19,37 --> 0:6:27,98
it rains, when the air is clearer. Here`s
hoping your pollen season isn`t appalling.


84
0:6:27,98 --> 0:6:32,389
Something else you can count on around this
time every year - spring training. Games don`t


85
0:6:32,389 --> 0:6:35,9
officially count until the end of March, but
the next several weeks are a big deal to the


86
0:6:35,9 --> 0:6:40,21
guys trying to make the team. The fans showing
up at the ball part in the cities that host


87
0:6:40,21 --> 0:6:44,53
the annual events. Mark McKey (ph) covers
the basis on the spring tradition for the


88
0:6:44,53 --> 0:6:45,26
boys of summer.


89
0:6:45,26 --> 0:6:45,7
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


90
0:6:45,7 --> 0:6:49,4
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You could say it`s like
a car. You got to get it warmed up before


91
0:6:49,4 --> 0:6:54,0
you get it out there on the open road, and
that`s what baseball teams do in the spring.


92
0:6:54,0 --> 0:7:1,26
It`s an annual right of spring were Major
League teams make their way to Florida and


93
0:7:1,26 --> 0:7:7,639
Arizona to get ready for the 162 game regular
season. In Florida, they play what`s known


94
0:7:7,639 --> 0:7:11,79
as the Great Fruit League. And that, of course,
mainly teams on the East Coast with some Midwest


95
0:7:11,79 --> 0:7:16,949
teams thrown in. The Cactus League, that`s
the spring training sites in Arizona, and


96
0:7:16,949 --> 0:7:20,919
mainly West Coast teams are a part of that
league.


97
0:7:20,919 --> 0:7:28,52
It usually takes pitchers a lot, an extra
four to five weeks to get ready for the actual


98
0:7:28,52 --> 0:7:33,23
start of the regular season. So, when you
have the pitchers in there, working on their


99
0:7:33,23 --> 0:7:36,87
arms, they need somebody to catch the balls,
and that`s where the catchers also report


100
0:7:36,87 --> 0:7:40,27
earlier than a lot of the position players
do.


101
0:7:40,27 --> 0:7:46,25
A lot of Minor League players show up and
try to prove themselves to the Major League


102
0:7:46,25 --> 0:7:49,83
coaches and managers that they belong on the
team. If they don`t make the Major League


103
0:7:49,83 --> 0:7:52,62
roster, then they go back to the Minor League
to hone their craft.


104
0:7:52,62 --> 0:7:56,68
If the Major League player gets injured, or
he has to go on the disabled list, a lot of


105
0:7:56,68 --> 0:8:0,75
those Minor League players will come up from
those teams and actually make the big roster.


106
0:8:0,75 --> 0:8:8,49
So, there`s a lot riding on the spring training
weeks for these Minor League players.


107
0:8:8,49 --> 0:8:12,77
Fans will come to spring training, and want
to see these stars, these superstars players.


108
0:8:12,77 --> 0:8:16,13
And you have to remember in spring training,
it is a warm-up period, you will see a lot


109
0:8:16,13 --> 0:8:19,82
of the stars of the future on these teams,
a lot of the Minor League players that want


110
0:8:19,82 --> 0:8:25,55
to make the rosters. You will see superstars
sprinkled into these games, the spring training


111
0:8:25,55 --> 0:8:30,8
games, but you`re not going to be necessarily
guaranteed to see your favorite player, you


112
0:8:30,8 --> 0:8:34,88
have to hope for the best.


113
0:8:34,88 --> 0:8:39,219
Baseball being America`s pastime, spring training
has taken on a life of its own. It`s a wonderful


114
0:8:39,219 --> 0:8:44,35
opportunity for fans to get close up to the
game, and to the players who play the game.


115
0:8:44,35 --> 0:8:48,74
Autograph opportunities, even conversation
with players along the sidelines, commonly


116
0:8:48,74 --> 0:8:53,67
seeing spring training sites all throughout
the south, if you`re able to take this in,


117
0:8:53,67 --> 0:8:57,749
and you have a favorite team. That would certainly
make a point of heading to spring training


118
0:8:57,749 --> 0:9:0,4
one of these years.


119
0:9:0,4 --> 0:9:2,199

120
0:9:2,199 --> 0:9:6,35

a shot you just got to see.

(END VIDEO CLIP)


124
0:9:9,69 --> 0:9:18,43
AZUZ: Ashlee Arnau just hit a front flip half-court
shot. We`re not the only one impressed by


125
0:9:18,43 --> 0:9:23,749
this cheerleader`s amazing fit. The Harlem
Globetrotter asked Ashley to show them how


126
0:9:23,749 --> 0:9:26,709
it`s done. If you think her trick shock was
a one time fluke ...


127
0:9:26,709 --> 0:9:27,309
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


128
0:9:27,309 --> 0:9:27,72
GLOBETROTTER: Yes.


129

0:9:28,319 --> 0:9:28,93
(END VIDEO CLIP)


131
0:9:28,93 --> 0:9:33,49
AZUZ: But then, the Globetrotter in this Youtube
video then tries to recreate Ashlee`s achievement.


132
0:9:33,49 --> 0:9:37,809
His form still needs a little work, maybe,
but at least he made the shot. If you can


133
0:9:37,809 --> 0:9:41,839
put it all together, the crowd might flip
out. But if they`ve already seen Ashlee`s


134
0:9:41,839 --> 0:9:45,43
performance, they know the real score. That
used up the remainder of our time. For CNN
