###0 
###0 Eggs.
###1 Lots of raw eggs.
###2 Now there's a lot of cool science
###3 experiments to do with eggs.
###4 But today, we're talking about the strength of an egg.
###7 Believe it or not, right out of the shoot, you
###8 can try this at home.
###8 You just take a raw egg, put it in your hand and squeeze as
###11 hard as you want, and no matter how--
###14 Oh.
###15 I'm Steve Spangler and I'm all about making science fun.
###18 For the last 20 years, I've been teaching ways to turn
###21 ordinary science experiments into unforgettable learning
###24 experiences.
###25 I have an amazing team who will do whatever it takes to
###28 affect the way people think about science.
###31 And to do that I live by one motto.
###33 Make it big, do it right, give it class.
###36 
###41 Well, let me start by apologizing for my
###43 inappropriate conduct.
###45 I'll be better.
###48 The deal here is this, I didn't do the thing right,
###51 because if you take an egg, normally, and you put it in
###53 your hand and squeeze, there's no problem at all.
###55 But this hand would be fine, this hand is not.
###58 Why?
###59 Because of the ring.
###60 See the ring put pressure at a certain point and it broke.
###63 Which brings me to thinking this is pretty cool, if you
###66 make somebody with a ring squeeze it in their hands, it
###68 will crack on them.
###69 And somebody without the ring, it won't crack at all.
###71 It all has to boil down to the shape of the egg.
###74 And isn't nature amazing?
###75 How it knows how to make this dome shape.
###78 When you look at it like this, if this doesn't look like a
###80 little piece of architecture, I don't know what does, with
###82 that archway.
###83 And you look at how it distributes the weight on
###86 either side, perfectly.
###87 We simply emulate nature in architecture and it works.
###90 So a long way of saying, put it your hand
###93 like this and squeeze.
###94 And if you squeeze as hard as you can, honestly, as hard as
###97 you can, you can't break the egg.
###99 Because all of that pressure is being disseminated, or
###101 dispersed, all over that shell.
###104 Now there are times where I've done it this way, and tried to
###106 crack it like this.
###107 And sometimes it's a little easier, even
###109 this one's not bad.
###110 But as soon as the ring goes on like this and you squeeze,
###114 that causes a small little fracture and the egg breaks.
###117 And now you know the secret.
###119 But there's other cool things about an egg
###120 that you need to know.
###121 And it's what the egg is made out of.
###122 This shell, on the outside, is made out of a substance called
###125 calcium carbonate.
###126 And, believe it or not, that substance is easily dissolved
###129 using a simple acid like vinegar.
###132 Well it's a classic elementary science experiment.
###134 You take a raw egg and you put it in a container like this.
###137 And then you pour the vinegar over the top.
###140 Now, if you're in a chemistry class you might use something
###143 like hydrochloric acid.
###144 At home this vinegar is perfectly fine.
###147 There are two strengths of vinegar, so sometimes at the
###149 grocery store you can get concentrated vinegar and that
###152 will speed this whole process up.
###153 But even right now, take a look, you can start to see the
###156 bubbles forming on the outside of the egg.
###158 And those bubbles are carbon dioxide.
###161 So, over time, you're going to eat away at that calcium
###164 carbonate and you're going to get a naked egg.
###169 Well, it's going to be naked.
###171 But it's going to be naked in about a week or so.
###174 And you don't have time to watch it, even with time lapse
###176 you'd be bored.
###177 So I took the liberty of making one just a
###179 little while ago.
###181 Take a look at this.
###183 This is a naked egg.
###185 Now it doesn't seem like it, because we let this one sit a
###187 little bit longer.
###188 But look, it is.
###190 All of that outside shell has been removed.
###194 And here it is.
###195 But maybe the best way to be able to see it is to use a
###198 light like this.
###200 You can actually see some of the shell, right here.
###203 So you see this little part of the shell?
###205 But I found that it is even cooler if you take an egg and
###208 you only dip it partially in the vinegar.
###212 And this is what you get when you pull it out just
###214 a little bit early.
###215 This is the naked egg, but you see can see the shell is here
###218 on this side, and it's completely
###220 eaten away right here.
###221 So when you take a look at it, take a look at this.
###225 You can actually see the pits where the vinegar started to
###229 eat into like this.
###230 It's a partially naked egg.
###232 Well now that you know that an egg is strong, we need to find
###236 out just how strong it is.
###237 So it's time for a test.
###238 And the little set up that we have here is perfect.
###240 We happen to have a digital scale.
###242 That's what this is here.
###243 And I got the digital scale from the same people I was
###245 babysitting the dog from, that we used the speakers, you
###247 know, for the cornstarch monsters.
###248 Who would have thought--
###249 [BANG, BANG]
###250 --they got a scale.
###251 So we have a scale.
###252 And on top of that scale we're going to use the egg crate.
###255 So this will be a perfect way to be able to
###256 hold it, like that.
###257 And now, we're going to take a raw egg.
###260 And our raw egg's going to go right here.
###263 And then we're going to put some pressure on it.
###264 Well, we'll tare it out.
###265 Here, let me tear it out.
###267 All right, it's at zero.
###269 Perfect.
###270 All right, we're going to take the tray.
###271 The tray goes on top like this.
###274 And now we're going to put some pressure on just a single
###277 egg to see how much pressure I can put
###279 until it finally breaks.
###281 Watch.
###282 
###286 Ugh.
###287 13 pounds, somewhere around there.
###289 It's not very good.
###290 And see where that pressure point is?
###292 And it kind of makes sense, because when this was here,
###294 look at this.
###295 When it was on top, you can see where that pressure point,
###297 all the pressure was on the very, very top, there.
###300 So it's no wonder it broke.
###301 It's just like my ring being able to push into it.
###303 So I think we need more eggs.
###305 So let's go from one to four eggs.
###308 So if we can support all four corners sitting over here,
###310 let's see what that would do for us.
###313 One here.
###314 Here's let's do all four corners, like this.
###317 So, hopefully, we'll distribute the weight.
###319 And, hopefully, they're kind of the same height.
###324 It's pretty close.
###325 Looks like they're all about the same height.
###327 I'll try to keep the pressure equal here in the very center.
###330 All right, here we go.
###332 Here we go.
###335 This is good.
###337 [CLUNK]
###339 Shot the back and everything.
###340 It's disgusting back here.
###343 There you go.
###344 Look at this.
###345 Three eggs break.
###346 One's fine.
###347 Just means that the pressure wasn't the same.
###349 And I probably didn't make sure everything is equal.
###351 I think what's going to be best is if I put one here in
###354 the middle and another one here.
###355 Six eggs, which looks pretty good.
###359 Tray on top.
###360 Now we just have to have weight.
###362 I could get people here at the Spangler
###366 Playground to sit on it.
###368 I don't think they're going to do that.
###369 I think it's probably a better idea to get some
###371 books, lots of books.
###374 Books.
###376 Some of my favorite ones right here.
###377 Look at this one here, I love this one. "Science Circus."
###379 That's a good one. "Thanksgiving
###381 Magic," I love that.
###382 Oh, here's one of my favorite ones, look at this one here,
###384 "Naked Eggs and Flying Potatoes." I love this book.
###388 Oh, and here's the sequel, "Fire Bubbles and Exploding
###391 Toothpaste." Just don't know if they're still--
###393 oh, they are still available.
###394 Where can you get them?
###396 Stevespanglerscience.com.
###397 
###399 That's cool, torque.
###401 Check this out--
###403 oh, sorry.
###404 We've got some books and we need to have eggs.
###408 So here's what we've got.
###410 Here's this whole piece here.
###411 I think that the idea here is to get six eggs.
###415 And just inspect them and make sure
###417 they're good at the beginning.
###419 And let's see if we can get them all as even as possible.
###424 That looks a little high but maybe we'll be OK.
###427 We're going to say, just here, two in the very middle.
###430 Hopefully, try to keep things as symmetrical as possible.
###433 We can see how even this really is.
###436 Let's see if we're making contact all the way around,
###441 bingo, and we are.
###442 And take the tray off, because we want to tare it to know
###445 exactly how much weight.
###448 Perfect.
###450 All right, tray on top.
###451 
###454 Let's start adding some books.
###456 "Chemical Demonstrations," it's fitting.
###458 The bible for everybody who ever did
###460 demonstrations in college.
###462 So that's perfect.
###463 Everything is good.
###465 All right, here we go.
###467 Volume two, volume three.
###472 Even though we're just on the very tips of the eggs, we're
###475 distributing that weight over six eggs.
###478 So this one goes here.
###480 And how about a classic.
###483 One right here.
###484 This one's a great one.
###486 And how about these here.
###489 Good.
###490 
###493 One of my favorite books, a really hard to find.
###496 This "Mr. Wizard's Science Secrets," a great one.
###499 All right, this one goes here.
###501 I hear--
###502 I hear creaking.
###504 
###506 [CRUNCH]
###509 Thank goodness these two books were not the ones
###511 that broke the eggs.
###513 All right, 30 pounds.
###515 But 30 pounds and six eggs, not so bad.
###517 And we were on the very, very tops of the eggs.
###519 So if you wanted to turn this into like a science fair
###521 project, you would just simply relate the amount of pressure,
###524 or the weight, that you can put on here, to
###526 the number of eggs.
###527 So instead of just doing six, maybe you try
###529 eight, or you try ten.
###530 Or whatever it might be.
###532 Let's just use a whole tray of eggs and see how many books we
###535 can get on top.
###536 30 eggs, here we go.
###541 Careful of the first ones here, so we
###545 equalize the pressure.
###546 
###553 All right, that's it, all the books.
###556 And you can see--
###559 I'm hearing creaking.
###560 But I think it's the creaking of the actual container
###563 itself, and not the breaking of eggs.
###567 We are perfectly fine.
###570 The only way we'll be able to see, is to take all the books
###572 off and lift the tray.
###574 All right, here's the truth test.
###578 See, I'm pleasantly surprised.
###579 Look at this.
###581 The creaking that I heard was the sound of this egg carton,
###585 itself, moving, but if you look at these eggs, we are
###587 perfectly fine.
###588 We got to 59 pounds, total of 30 eggs, no cracks.
###592 We need more weight because we want to see what it takes to
###595 be able to break this.
###597 You know what we need?
###598 Not more books.
###599 We don't need bricks.
###600 We need people.
###604 Higginsworth, come here.
###606 No, it will be fun.
###607 Come here.
###609 356, 57, 58, 59, 60.
###613 360 eggs.
###615 Sure, I could have done some quick multiplication, but why
###618 when you can count?
###619 Because counting is fun.
###621 Here's the deal.
###621 This is the ultimate egg stunt.
###623 We saw how strong they are, now we want to see if we can
###626 walk them, because these little eggs are saying, (IN A
###628 SQUEAKY VOICE) please walk on me.
###629 Please whatever you do, walk on me.
###632 And we want to fulfill their every desire.
###634 So we're going to walk on them.
###636 But not me.
###637 No, no.
###637 We're going to find something that you know and you love, my
###640 best friend, Higginsworth.
###642 Come here, Higginsworth.
###644 All right, this is going to be great.
###645 Sounds good.
###646 Get off the phone.
###647 No, I'm available to start any time.
###649 He can't start anytime.
###651 I got to go.
###652 Sorry.
###653 So what are we doing?
###653 OK, look.
###654 You're going to walk on eggs.
###655 OK?
###656 So I need you to those shoes off.
###658 And we are going to walk on eggs.
###660 Go.
###660 Get them off.
###661 All right.
###661 Let's do it.
###663 Whoa.
###665 
###667 Where did you get feet like that?
###669 Let's not worry about that.
###670 What are we doing here?
###672 Listen, I think you need to get them wrapped up.
###675 So get some bubble wrap.
###676 I want a nice cushion as you're going through here.
###678 I don't want these eggs, breaking.
###679 OK.
###679 Bubble wrap.
###680 
###682 OK.
###683 Perfect.
###684 Here's the deal, if you make all the way across, no broken
###686 eggs, you're going to get, in addition to your $20 this
###689 week, an extra $5.
###691 You're going to find a five.
###693 That is impressive.
###693 OK.
###694 Here we go.
###694 Go.
###695 Nice, I'm helping you, good job, yes.
###700 This is good.
###702 Perfect.
###703 Perfect.
###704 And it's there.
###705 And look back and see what a great job you--
###707 son of a [BLIP]
###709 It's the bubble wrap.
###710 Why did you move forward with the bubble wrap idea?
###713 Bad idea.
###713 I should have had your actual feet on there.
###716 Can you get the bubble wrap off, please?
###719 Wow, I can get over those feet.
###721 Yikes.
###722 All right, this time, no bubble wrap.
###726 So we replaced all the eggs.
###727 This time, no bubble wrap, bare feet.
###729 I think it's going to be better because the feet will
###731 contour to the eggs.
###732 I think it's going to be good.
###735 OK, so here we go.
###738 There you go, good.
###741 Good.
###741 It's OK, keep going, let's go.
###743 There you go.
###743 Go, ready?
###744 And, good, good, good, keep going, and go, go.
###751 And go, go.
###754 Go go, good.
###756 Go, go.
###759 All right, all right, do you think we can fix that in post?
###763 Well here's what we just learned, as big and cool as
###766 these trays are with a total of 30 eggs, they
###769 don't work at all.
###771 They just don't support the eggs.
###772 And we had a couple that cracked.
###774 And then these became very flimsy.
###776 So if you're trying to impress your friends, don't be using
###778 these big huge crates.
###780 By accident, we looked at these smaller cartons.
###783 Look at this, the smaller carton has a lot more support
###786 for those eggs.
###787 And so we're going to stagger them like this.
###789 And we think, or at least the theory is, that this is going
###792 to support the feet much better.
###794 All right, Higginsworth, here we go.
###797 OK, left foot on first.
###798 Let's see.
###800 That's it.
###800 That's it.
###801 Good.
###802 Good.
###803 Good, walk through, you're doing great.
###806 I hear it.
###807 You're doing great.
###808 10 cartons total.
###809 Look at this, 10 cartons, total.
###811 You ready?
###812 Here.
###812 Nice.
###813 Look at that.
###813 All right, there's creaking but come here and
###815 take a look at this.
###815 We have a couple little minor cracks, but
###818 nothing that's horrible.
###819 Nice job, Higgins--
###821 You did it.
###822 It's the egg walk.
###822 Thanks, Steve.
###823 All right, you're going to enjoy your egg walk.
###825 This is going to be great.
###826 And, Higs, the greatest thing here is, watch.
###829 These are not broken, so--
###831 What am I doing with these?
###832 You can return them.
###833 All right?
###834 To the store?
###835 Get them back fast.
###836 All right.
###836 So, that will be absolutely perfect.
###838 Or, why don't you make your mom a nice omelet.
###841 You know how you're pretty good at making omelets?
###843 All right, so just make her an omelet.
###845 OK.
###845 This will be great.
###846 How about tomorrow morning you bring us all some
###848 omelets, all right?
###849 That'll be great.
###850 And just tell her, that we just used these
###852 a little tiny bit.
###853 So, it's fine.
###854 But I don't want to waste those eggs.
###855 OK?
###856 Got it?
###857 OK.
###857 Here you go.
###858 Put those in your car.
###859 Taking these back.
###861 [PLOP]
###863 [SIGH]
