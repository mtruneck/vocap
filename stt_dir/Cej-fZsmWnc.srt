BETH HOYT: That is hot,
muy caliente.


9
0:0:25,25 --> 0:0:26,0
It was good, right?


10
0:0:26,0 --> 0:0:27,64
I love every one on the show.


11
0:0:27,64 --> 0:0:29,48
This is exciting.


12
0:0:29,48 --> 0:0:30,15
Oh, boy.


13
0:0:30,15 --> 0:0:30,67
NATHAN BARNATT: And--


14
0:0:30,67 --> 0:0:32,189
BETH HOYT: Whoa!

0:0:32,189 --> 0:0:35,18

0:0:37,666 --> 0:0:38,96
BETH HOYT: Oh, yeah.


18
0:0:38,96 --> 0:0:39,64
Wow!


19
0:0:39,64 --> 0:0:40,84
That's a kick.


20
0:0:40,84 --> 0:0:43,8
SPANDY ANDY: Not to mention, you

0:0:51,99 --> 0:0:54,28
guest, Ray William Johnson.


24
0:0:54,28 --> 0:0:55,59
NATHAN BARNATT: And last night's
international comedy


25
0:0:55,59 --> 0:0:59,204
show is up in its entirety.


26
0:0:59,204 --> 0:1:3,2
[APPLAUSE]


27
0:1:3,2 --> 0:1:6,346
BETH HOYT: That's a very
impressive hip flexor.


28
0:1:6,346 --> 0:1:8,2
It's so--


29
0:1:8,2 --> 0:1:9,3
NATHAN BARNATT: Let's
keep it rolling.


30
0:1:9,3 --> 0:1:10,4
BETH HOYT: Wow.


31
0:1:10,4 --> 0:1:12,26
Yeah, I mean, wow.


32
0:1:12,26 --> 0:1:14,65
I'm from [? France-uh. ?]


33
0:1:14,65 --> 0:1:16,16
That joke doesn't work
as well because we


34
0:1:16,16 --> 0:1:17,12
have the kicking thing.


35
0:1:17,12 --> 0:1:17,97
But that's--


36
0:1:17,97 --> 0:1:19,78
NATHAN BARNATT: Oh, I think
I know what you're saying.


37
0:1:19,78 --> 0:1:21,7
BETH HOYT: That's OK.


38
0:1:21,7 --> 0:1:22,35
We got there.


39
0:1:22,35 --> 0:1:23,19
That was just--


40
0:1:23,19 --> 0:1:26,48
that's quite a lot of balancing,
dexterity you--


41
0:1:26,48 --> 0:1:29,6
NATHAN BARNATT: You
noticed my wood.


42
0:1:29,6 --> 0:1:30,84
BETH HOYT: Your wood is
right in my face.


43
0:1:30,84 --> 0:1:32,74
Getting real close to my face.


44
0:1:32,74 --> 0:1:35,44
NATHAN BARNATT: Plus we keep
on churning out Comedy Week


45
0:1:35,44 --> 0:1:39,142
videos, which can be seen
at H-T-T-P W dot dot


46
0:1:39,142 --> 0:1:40,83
youtubecomedy.com/comedyweek.


47
0:1:40,83 --> 0:1:41,91
BETH HOYT: Thank you for letting
everyone know that.


48
0:1:41,91 --> 0:1:44,47
Man, when they churn it out,
it's like that Play-Doh


49
0:1:44,47 --> 0:1:46,5
machine you guys know we had
as kids, with like the--


50
0:1:46,5 --> 0:1:47,44
spaghetti comes out?


51
0:1:47,44 --> 0:1:48,97
I miss being a kid so bad.


52
0:1:48,97 --> 0:1:49,78
I so miss it.


53
0:1:49,78 --> 0:1:51,63
I want to be a kid again.


54
0:1:51,63 --> 0:1:52,56
I just want to be there.


55
0:1:52,56 --> 0:1:57,13
NATHAN BARNATT: OK, you
are on ecstasy, Beth.


56
0:1:57,13 --> 0:1:58,3
BETH HOYT: OK, you're a narc.


57
0:1:58,3 --> 0:2:0,69
You're such a narc, seriously.


58
0:2:0,69 --> 0:2:2,67
Join us again tomorrow
for more.


59
0:2:2,67 --> 0:2:5,37
Without further a-dude--


60
0:2:5,37 --> 0:2:5,71
yeah.


61
0:2:5,71 --> 0:2:6,88
OK.


62
0:2:6,88 --> 0:2:7,504
NATHAN BARNATT: That
was pretty good.


63
0:2:7,504 --> 0:2:7,8
That was pretty good.


64
0:2:7,8 --> 0:2:8,69
BETH HOYT: Just trying.


65
0:2:8,69 --> 0:2:9,889
Thank you.


66
0:2:9,889 --> 0:2:11,93
Let's commence with
UCB comedy.


67
0:2:11,93 --> 0:2:13,914
[APPLAUSE]


68
0:2:13,914 --> 0:2:23,834
[MUSIC PLAYING]


69
0:2:23,834 --> 0:2:46,154
[APPLAUSE]


70
0:2:46,154 --> 0:2:50,14
JOE WENGERT: Thanks
a lot, guys.


71
0:2:50,14 --> 0:2:55,19
Welcome to UCB Comedy, live
from the YouTube space.


72
0:2:55,19 --> 0:2:56,44
How you guys feeling tonight?


73
0:2:56,44 --> 0:3:1,9



74
0:3:1,9 --> 0:3:3,15
We're here tonight as a
part of Comedy Week.


75
0:3:3,15 --> 0:3:4,13
I don't know about you guys.


76
0:3:4,13 --> 0:3:6,4
I can't believe it's Comedy
Week already.


77
0:3:6,4 --> 0:3:8,39
The year went by so quickly.


78
0:3:8,39 --> 0:3:10,21
JON GABRUS: I feel like it was
just drama week weeks ago.


79
0:3:10,21 --> 0:3:12,34
JOE WENGERT: I know.


80
0:3:12,34 --> 0:3:15,77
I just took down all my Comedy
Week decorations, and now here


81
0:3:15,77 --> 0:3:18,78
we are celebrating
it once again.


82
0:3:18,78 --> 0:3:21,25
We're performers from the
Upright Citizens Brigade


83
0:3:21,25 --> 0:3:22,445
theatre in Los Angeles.


84
0:3:22,445 --> 0:3:25,5
And what we're going to be
doing tonight for you is


85
0:3:25,5 --> 0:3:26,77
improv comedy.


86
0:3:26,77 --> 0:3:29,18
We're going to be watching
real YouTube videos.


87
0:3:29,18 --> 0:3:32,24
And that's going to serve as
the inspiration for comedy


88
0:3:32,24 --> 0:3:34,7
scenes that we're going to
make up on the spot.


89
0:3:34,7 --> 0:3:37,32
They've never been
seen before.


90
0:3:37,32 --> 0:3:40,6
And they will never
be seen again.


91
0:3:40,6 --> 0:3:43,1
I mean, you can go back
and rewatch it again.


92
0:3:43,1 --> 0:3:46,76
But in theory, we're not
going to do them again.


93
0:3:46,76 --> 0:3:48,342
Are you guys excited
about that?


94
0:3:48,342 --> 0:3:56,23
[APPLAUSE]


95
0:3:56,23 --> 0:4:0,2
Improv is all about the ensemble
and about the group,


96
0:4:0,2 --> 0:4:2,86
so now let's take some time
to introduce ourselves


97
0:4:2,86 --> 0:4:6,15
individually as performers.


98
0:4:6,15 --> 0:4:7,41
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Hi, I'm
Mike Leffingwell.


99
0:4:7,41 --> 0:4:11,438



100
0:4:11,438 --> 0:4:12,38
TONI RAMOS: Hey, guys.


101
0:4:12,38 --> 0:4:13,63
I'm Toni Ramos.


102
0:4:13,63 --> 0:4:17,116



103
0:4:17,116 --> 0:4:18,13
JOE WENGERT: Hi, everybody.


104
0:4:18,13 --> 0:4:19,44
I was already talking.


105
0:4:19,44 --> 0:4:20,69
My name's Joe Wengert.


106
0:4:20,69 --> 0:4:23,87



107
0:4:23,87 --> 0:4:25,705
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Hi,
Drew DiFonzo Marks.


108
0:4:25,705 --> 0:4:30,9



109
0:4:30,9 --> 0:4:32,36
JON GABRUS: One guy loved it.


110
0:4:32,36 --> 0:4:34,37
I am Jon Gabrus.


111
0:4:34,37 --> 0:4:35,62
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, my god.


112
0:4:35,62 --> 0:4:40,26



113
0:4:40,26 --> 0:4:41,36
ALLAN MCLEOD: And I'm
the last one.


114
0:4:41,36 --> 0:4:42,43
I'm Allan McLeod.


115
0:4:42,43 --> 0:4:43,356
How's it going?


116
0:4:43,356 --> 0:4:47,53
[APPLAUSE]


117
0:4:47,53 --> 0:4:47,9
JOE WENGERT: OK.


118
0:4:47,9 --> 0:4:50,79
Now that you know our first
and last names,


119
0:4:50,79 --> 0:4:53,59
it's time to do improv.


120
0:4:53,59 --> 0:4:55,62
Let's roll the first
YouTube clip.


121
0:4:55,62 --> 0:5:0,56



122
0:5:0,56 --> 0:5:4,48
CRAZYPUERTORRICAN99: Cartoon
Network, you have


123
0:5:4,48 --> 0:5:5,67
fucking done it again.


124
0:5:5,67 --> 0:5:7,6
I am sick of it.


125
0:5:7,6 --> 0:5:12,65
Cartoon Network, I am
just sick of this.


126
0:5:12,65 --> 0:5:15,7
OK.


127
0:5:15,7 --> 0:5:18,67
You cancel "Young Justice" and
"Green Lantern," the only


128
0:5:18,67 --> 0:5:22,76
reason to watch Cartoon
Network right now.


129
0:5:22,76 --> 0:5:24,41
OK?


130
0:5:24,41 --> 0:5:27,865
And this happened before.
"Toonami--" you know


131
0:5:27,865 --> 0:5:31,3
"Toonami." That got canceled
for low ratings.


132
0:5:31,3 --> 0:5:32,81
OK.


133
0:5:32,81 --> 0:5:36,12
But this was the only thing
that was worth watching on


134
0:5:36,12 --> 0:5:37,37
Cartoon Network.


135
0:5:37,37 --> 0:5:42,1



136
0:5:42,1 --> 0:5:46,6
They just-- why do
they do that?


137
0:5:46,6 --> 0:5:49,64
Hell, Boomerang has
better shows.


138
0:5:49,64 --> 0:5:52,12
Disney Channel has now better
shows, and that


139
0:5:52,12 --> 0:5:53,72
has a lot to say.


140
0:5:53,72 --> 0:5:57,832
Cartoon Network, what
the fuck is wrong?


141
0:5:57,832 --> 0:6:2,1



142
0:6:2,1 --> 0:6:7,61
You guys just can't
keep doing this.


143
0:6:7,61 --> 0:6:11,24
"Toonami," childhood ruined.


144
0:6:11,24 --> 0:6:13,86
"DC Nation--" "DC Nation"
is a one hour block.


145
0:6:13,86 --> 0:6:17,19
It should be more.


146
0:6:17,19 --> 0:6:19,97
This could have been the new
"Toonami," but just with


147
0:6:19,97 --> 0:6:21,3
superhero shows.


148
0:6:21,3 --> 0:6:22,91
They could have had
three hours.


149
0:6:22,91 --> 0:6:26,2
Like they could have had two
hours of the new shows and


150
0:6:26,2 --> 0:6:30,24
like one hour of the
classics, like


151
0:6:30,24 --> 0:6:31,61
"Teen Titans," or "Batman--


152
0:6:31,61 --> 0:6:37,38
The Animated Series," "Justice
League Unlimited." But OK, to


153
0:6:37,38 --> 0:6:40,19
do this again?


154
0:6:40,19 --> 0:6:41,44
Nah.


155
0:6:41,44 --> 0:6:45,142
I'm just sick and tired
of this shit.


156
0:6:45,142 --> 0:6:47,16
You know what, Cartoon
Network?


157
0:6:47,16 --> 0:6:50,75
The only think I'm watching
right now is Adult Swim.


158
0:6:50,75 --> 0:6:55,69
And that's because of "Toonami."
It's only because


159
0:6:55,69 --> 0:7:0,312
of "Toonami," and I only
watch it on Saturdays.


160
0:7:0,312 --> 0:7:4,9
Get that through your
fucking skulls and


161
0:7:4,9 --> 0:7:8,26
just stop doing this.


162
0:7:8,26 --> 0:7:9,445
That's all.


163
0:7:9,445 --> 0:7:10,3
Stay cool.


164
0:7:10,3 --> 0:7:11,55
Bang.


165
0:7:11,55 --> 0:7:14,7



166
0:7:14,7 --> 0:7:16,48
[APPLAUSE]


167
0:7:16,48 --> 0:7:17,47
JOE WENGERT: OK.


168
0:7:17,47 --> 0:7:20,15
So, we all watched that video
for the first time with the


169
0:7:20,15 --> 0:7:22,2
rest of you, right now.


170
0:7:22,2 --> 0:7:24,28
And we're going to use that
video as the inspiration for


171
0:7:24,28 --> 0:7:27,41
some improvised scenes.


172
0:7:27,41 --> 0:7:32,27
[APPLAUSE]


173
0:7:32,27 --> 0:7:33,12
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Excuse me.


174
0:7:33,12 --> 0:7:34,75
Are you the manager of
this McDonald's?


175
0:7:34,75 --> 0:7:36,34
TONI RAMOS: Uh, yes sir, I am.


176
0:7:36,34 --> 0:7:37,58
How can I help you?


177
0:7:37,58 --> 0:7:38,693
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Oh,
you can help me by


178
0:7:38,693 --> 0:7:39,44
answering this question.


179
0:7:39,44 --> 0:7:40,69
TONI RAMOS: OK, great.


180
0:7:40,69 --> 0:7:43,22
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Where
the fuck is the McRib?


181
0:7:43,22 --> 0:7:46,0



182
0:7:46,0 --> 0:7:48,0
Where is it?


183
0:7:48,0 --> 0:7:51,4
TONI RAMOS: Sir, the McRib
is a limited time thing.


184
0:7:51,4 --> 0:7:53,35
It's in the month of
June, so it'll be


185
0:7:53,35 --> 0:7:55,82
coming up in a few weeks.


186
0:7:55,82 --> 0:7:56,13
If you can come--


187
0:7:56,13 --> 0:7:56,48
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Oh, OK.


188
0:7:56,48 --> 0:7:57,49
Hey, yeah, yeah.


189
0:7:57,49 --> 0:7:58,63
No, I got a great idea.


190
0:7:58,63 --> 0:8:1,12
Why don't we only have sunshine
in the month of June,


191
0:8:1,12 --> 0:8:3,97
and it's total darkness
for the other 11


192
0:8:3,97 --> 0:8:5,63
months of the year?


193
0:8:5,63 --> 0:8:7,205
Why are you fucking America?


194
0:8:7,205 --> 0:8:10,67



195
0:8:10,67 --> 0:8:11,69
DREW DIFONZO MARKS:
Hi, can I get a


196
0:8:11,69 --> 0:8:13,88
number four, super sized?


197
0:8:13,88 --> 0:8:17,36
And instead of a soft drink,
can I get a Shamrock shake?


198
0:8:17,36 --> 0:8:18,51
TONI RAMOS: Oh, sorry.


199
0:8:18,51 --> 0:8:19,83
We don't have Shamrock shakes.


200
0:8:19,83 --> 0:8:23,7
DREW DIFONZO MARKS:
Go fuck yourself.


201
0:8:23,7 --> 0:8:24,97
TONI RAMOS: It's been
a rough day, sir.


202
0:8:24,97 --> 0:8:27,6



203
0:8:27,6 --> 0:8:28,65
ALLAN MCLEOD: I've been
looking around


204
0:8:28,65 --> 0:8:31,954
the Playland area.


205
0:8:31,954 --> 0:8:32,452
TONI RAMOS: Oh, great.


206
0:8:32,452 --> 0:8:35,14
Yeah.


207
0:8:35,14 --> 0:8:36,19
Did you lose a kid?


208
0:8:36,19 --> 0:8:37,48
Or are you--


209
0:8:37,48 --> 0:8:40,624
ALLAN MCLEOD: I think you
guys lost Grimace.


210
0:8:40,624 --> 0:8:43,59
Where the fuck is Grimace?


211
0:8:43,59 --> 0:8:47,67
Where's my big purple man?


212
0:8:47,67 --> 0:8:51,16
TONI RAMOS: Sir, that's
just an action figure.


213
0:8:51,16 --> 0:8:53,4
He's not like a real
guy running around.


214
0:8:53,4 --> 0:8:54,53
He's just like a--


215
0:8:54,53 --> 0:8:54,85
ALLAN MCLEOD: What?


216
0:8:54,85 --> 0:8:57,23
What's wrong with you?


217
0:8:57,23 --> 0:8:58,61
JOE WENGERT: OK.


218
0:8:58,61 --> 0:9:0,72
Toni, we've heard your
complaints, and--


219
0:9:0,72 --> 0:9:2,55
TONI RAMOS: I mean,
they are rough.


220
0:9:2,55 --> 0:9:6,14
So many guys have told me to
go fuck myself, that I'm an


221
0:9:6,14 --> 0:9:8,55
idiot, threw out the C-word.


222
0:9:8,55 --> 0:9:9,92
JOE WENGERT: Look,
these products


223
0:9:9,92 --> 0:9:11,31
are seasonal products.


224
0:9:11,31 --> 0:9:12,8
There's no way that
we can offer them


225
0:9:12,8 --> 0:9:13,48
throughout the year.


226
0:9:13,48 --> 0:9:17,39
The best that I can do for you
is give you this handgun, OK?


227
0:9:17,39 --> 0:9:21,52
If someone is especially irate
about the fact that they can't


228
0:9:21,52 --> 0:9:22,885
get a specific--


229
0:9:22,885 --> 0:9:23,76
JON GABRUS: I'll have--


230
0:9:23,76 --> 0:9:25,1
TONI RAMOS: Pow.


231
0:9:25,1 --> 0:9:28,5



232
0:9:28,5 --> 0:9:28,41
JON GABRUS: Come on!


233
0:9:28,41 --> 0:9:30,47
Ow.


234
0:9:30,47 --> 0:9:35,26
JOE WENGERT: I need the
gun back, because--


235
0:9:35,26 --> 0:9:38,85
[APPLAUSE]


236
0:9:38,85 --> 0:9:42,58
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: So it's
a lovely apartment.


237
0:9:42,58 --> 0:9:42,8
JON GABRUS: I noticed.


238
0:9:42,8 --> 0:9:43,3
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Thank you.


239
0:9:43,3 --> 0:9:45,41
So honestly, it's in
a great school


240
0:9:45,41 --> 0:9:47,83
district, hardwood floors.


241
0:9:47,83 --> 0:9:48,45
Second floor--


242
0:9:48,45 --> 0:9:49,39
I'll take you up there.


243
0:9:49,39 --> 0:9:49,7
JON GABRUS: Great.


244
0:9:49,7 --> 0:9:51,82
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Now, these
three katana swords are on the


245
0:9:51,82 --> 0:9:53,18
wall at all times.


246
0:9:53,18 --> 0:9:53,96
JON GABRUS: Yeah, I was just--


247
0:9:53,96 --> 0:9:54,78
I was going to ask about it.


248
0:9:54,78 --> 0:9:57,48
Because I have kids, bunch
of crazy, fucking kids.


249
0:9:57,48 --> 0:10:0,35
And I can't have them playing
with katana blades or


250
0:10:0,35 --> 0:10:0,84
whatever that is.


251
0:10:0,84 --> 0:10:2,36
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: They are
part of the apartment.


252
0:10:2,36 --> 0:10:4,93
They are non-negotiable.


253
0:10:4,93 --> 0:10:7,92
Did you call your own
kids fucking crazy?


254
0:10:7,92 --> 0:10:9,95
JON GABRUS: When you see these
monsters, you'll know what I'm


255
0:10:9,95 --> 0:10:10,6
talking about.


256
0:10:10,6 --> 0:10:12,98
One kid eats wood
by the pound.


257
0:10:12,98 --> 0:10:15,15
I can't-- it's a fucking
nightmare.


258
0:10:15,15 --> 0:10:16,21
DREW DIFONZO MARKS:
That's crazy.


259
0:10:16,21 --> 0:10:16,79
JON GABRUS: Thank you.


260
0:10:16,79 --> 0:10:17,1
See?


261
0:10:17,1 --> 0:10:19,41
I'm not like using that like,
oh, my crazy kids.


262
0:10:19,41 --> 0:10:22,66
Like I think there's serious
mental issues.


263
0:10:22,66 --> 0:10:22,98
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Sure.


264
0:10:22,98 --> 0:10:24,57
I'm a father myself.


265
0:10:24,57 --> 0:10:24,84
JON GABRUS: Oh.


266
0:10:24,84 --> 0:10:25,66
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Yeah.


267
0:10:25,66 --> 0:10:26,95
JON GABRUS: I would never
have guessed.


268
0:10:26,95 --> 0:10:27,21
DREW DIFONZO MARKS:
One of my kids?


269
0:10:27,21 --> 0:10:28,9
Bonkers.


270
0:10:28,9 --> 0:10:29,66
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Dad,
are you done?


271
0:10:29,66 --> 0:10:30,8
JON GABRUS: No, we're not--


272
0:10:30,8 --> 0:10:30,61
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: We're
running out of


273
0:10:30,61 --> 0:10:32,26
oxygen in the car.


274
0:10:32,26 --> 0:10:35,52
JON GABRUS: Mike, you're not
in the car anymore, so your


275
0:10:35,52 --> 0:10:36,94
oxygen should be fine.


276
0:10:36,94 --> 0:10:41,4
And that is my good doorstop.


277
0:10:41,4 --> 0:10:41,8
God damn it, Mike.


278
0:10:41,8 --> 0:10:43,21
You took this from my--


279
0:10:43,21 --> 0:10:45,11
I use this doorstop
to hold my door.


280
0:10:45,11 --> 0:10:48,3
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Mom lets
me eat doorstops.


281
0:10:48,3 --> 0:10:49,13
JON GABRUS: Well then you
can eat it on the


282
0:10:49,13 --> 0:10:50,36
weekend when you go visit.


283
0:10:50,36 --> 0:10:52,0
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Oh, I will.


284
0:10:52,0 --> 0:10:53,17
I will.


285
0:10:53,17 --> 0:10:55,15
JON GABRUS: Sit down
right there.


286
0:10:55,15 --> 0:10:56,14
Thank you.


287
0:10:56,14 --> 0:10:57,0
DREW DIFONZO MARKS:
So you have kids.


288
0:10:57,0 --> 0:10:57,29
OK.


289
0:10:57,29 --> 0:10:58,525
So it seems like this
is a big apartment.


290
0:10:58,525 --> 0:10:59,43
It might be good.


291
0:10:59,43 --> 0:11:2,38
JON GABRUS: Yeah, it might be.


292
0:11:2,38 --> 0:11:3,48
Are those blades sharp?


293
0:11:3,48 --> 0:11:5,5
I got to-- this is a
hard for me to--


294
0:11:5,5 --> 0:11:7,58
that seems like a very specific
thing to have in an


295
0:11:7,58 --> 0:11:9,31
apartment that is
non-negotiable.


296
0:11:9,31 --> 0:11:13,52
I feel like, once I move in and
you're not around, I could


297
0:11:13,52 --> 0:11:14,77
take the katana blade.


298
0:11:14,77 --> 0:11:16,48
Just like I lived in an
apartment where the landlord


299
0:11:16,48 --> 0:11:17,7
said, you can't go
on the roof.


300
0:11:17,7 --> 0:11:21,29
The second he left I went up on
the roof and smoked weed.


301
0:11:21,29 --> 0:11:23,2
So I feel like the second you
leave, I'm going to put those


302
0:11:23,2 --> 0:11:25,93
katanas in a drawer or
I'm going to play


303
0:11:25,93 --> 0:11:26,89
with them by myself.


304
0:11:26,89 --> 0:11:28,6
ALLAN MCLEOD: Daddy.


305
0:11:28,6 --> 0:11:28,356
JON GABRUS: Oh, no.


306
0:11:28,356 --> 0:11:29,7
What is it, Bruno?


307
0:11:29,7 --> 0:11:30,99
ALLAN MCLEOD: I pooped
nails again.


308
0:11:30,99 --> 0:11:33,68



309
0:11:33,68 --> 0:11:37,83
Nails came out of my butt.


310
0:11:37,83 --> 0:11:39,54
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: I thought
my kids were crazy.


311
0:11:39,54 --> 0:11:41,25
JON GABRUS: No, my kids
are genuinely crazy.


312
0:11:41,25 --> 0:11:43,5
They eat things that
aren't food.


313
0:11:43,5 --> 0:11:44,56
ALLAN MCLEOD: Dad, I got
a nail in my eye.


314
0:11:44,56 --> 0:11:47,18
If I'd had wood, it might
have stopped it.


315
0:11:47,18 --> 0:11:48,58
JON GABRUS: It's not how it--
are you pooping in your


316
0:11:48,58 --> 0:11:49,685
brother's eyes again?


317
0:11:49,685 --> 0:11:50,94
ALLAN MCLEOD: Yeah.


318
0:11:50,94 --> 0:11:52,86
JON GABRUS: Please, Bruno,
none of that.


319
0:11:52,86 --> 0:11:54,88
And what do we say?


320
0:11:54,88 --> 0:11:57,37
It's I made boom-boom
with nails.


321
0:11:57,37 --> 0:11:58,73
Trying to teach them
better language.


322
0:11:58,73 --> 0:12:1,5



323
0:12:1,5 --> 0:12:3,92
ALLAN MCLEOD: Nice swords.


324
0:12:3,92 --> 0:12:5,1
JON GABRUS: OK.


325
0:12:5,1 --> 0:12:6,8
You've got a point
there, Mike.


326
0:12:6,8 --> 0:12:9,75
Insane fucking child
likes swords.


327
0:12:9,75 --> 0:12:11,8
Shit nails.


328
0:12:11,8 --> 0:12:12,57
Do you know how you
shit nails?


329
0:12:12,57 --> 0:12:14,62
Do you see how casual
he was about it?


330
0:12:14,62 --> 0:12:16,16
That would ruin most people.


331
0:12:16,16 --> 0:12:16,99
My kids have--


332
0:12:16,99 --> 0:12:18,75
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: It's
a jarring experience


333
0:12:18,75 --> 0:12:19,75
for me to see that.


334
0:12:19,75 --> 0:12:22,13
JON GABRUS: My kids are like
fucking cartoon sharks.


335
0:12:22,13 --> 0:12:23,83
They swallow everything.


336
0:12:23,83 --> 0:12:24,56
I swear.


337
0:12:24,56 --> 0:12:26,45
You know how cartoons
sharks do that.


338
0:12:26,45 --> 0:12:28,8
Is that not a casual
expression here?


339
0:12:28,8 --> 0:12:29,47
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Here?


340
0:12:29,47 --> 0:12:30,16
JON GABRUS: Yeah,
where are we?


341
0:12:30,16 --> 0:12:31,28
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: We're
in this apartment.


342
0:12:31,28 --> 0:12:31,433
JON GABRUS: Yeah.


343
0:12:31,433 --> 0:12:31,95
Yeah, all right.


344
0:12:31,95 --> 0:12:32,31
JOE WENGERT: Dad?


345
0:12:32,31 --> 0:12:34,19
Daddy?


346
0:12:34,19 --> 0:12:35,28
JON GABRUS: One at
a time they come.


347
0:12:35,28 --> 0:12:36,57
What is it?


348
0:12:36,57 --> 0:12:38,41
JOE WENGERT: I finished
my math worksheet.


349
0:12:38,41 --> 0:12:40,25
I need you to check
over my answers.


350
0:12:40,25 --> 0:12:43,13
JON GABRUS: Get out of
here, you sick fuck.


351
0:12:43,13 --> 0:12:44,5
You're a fucking nightmare.


352
0:12:44,5 --> 0:12:47,13
JOE WENGERT: I need you
to check my answers.


353
0:12:47,13 --> 0:12:47,325
JON GABRUS: No.


354
0:12:47,325 --> 0:12:48,12
No.


355
0:12:48,12 --> 0:12:50,6
JOE WENGERT: How do I know
if they're right or not?


356
0:12:50,6 --> 0:12:52,421
JON GABRUS: Go clean up your
brother's nail shit.


357
0:12:52,421 --> 0:12:54,59
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Sir, I do
not mean to get involved, but


358
0:12:54,59 --> 0:12:56,5
that just seemed like a
child crying for help.


359
0:12:56,5 --> 0:12:58,75
JON GABRUS: But his pants didn't
even match his shirt.


360
0:12:58,75 --> 0:13:1,36
He's a wacky little kid.


361
0:13:1,36 --> 0:13:3,53
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: That's
not enough of a reason.


362
0:13:3,53 --> 0:13:4,48
Look, are your kids--


363
0:13:4,48 --> 0:13:6,26
JON GABRUS: I lump all my kids
together a little bit.


364
0:13:6,26 --> 0:13:8,4
Some of them are better
than others, OK?


365
0:13:8,4 --> 0:13:9,4
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: OK.


366
0:13:9,4 --> 0:13:11,96
JON GABRUS: But you know, by the
time the third one comes


367
0:13:11,96 --> 0:13:14,58
around, you're a little worked
up from your first two.


368
0:13:14,58 --> 0:13:15,84
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: And they're
all just out there in


369
0:13:15,84 --> 0:13:17,14
the car by themselves?


370
0:13:17,14 --> 0:13:17,52
JON GABRUS: Yeah.


371
0:13:17,52 --> 0:13:21,43
Do we have to keep this like,
awful, awful brown color that


372
0:13:21,43 --> 0:13:22,6
we have everywhere?


373
0:13:22,6 --> 0:13:23,29
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: God, no.


374
0:13:23,29 --> 0:13:25,55
JON GABRUS: I can repaint, but
I can't move the katanas.


375
0:13:25,55 --> 0:13:28,98
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: That's
the one thing.


376
0:13:28,98 --> 0:13:30,8
ALLAN MCLEOD: OK, everybody.


377
0:13:30,8 --> 0:13:37,0
[APPLAUSE]


378
0:13:37,0 --> 0:13:40,62
ALLAN MCLEOD: So, you know,
we've been having a lot of


379
0:13:40,62 --> 0:13:45,24
programming issues here, people
not a big fan of what


380
0:13:45,24 --> 0:13:49,3
we're doing at the
Hallmark Channel.


381
0:13:49,3 --> 0:13:56,36
So we brought into a new
kid to be the CEO of


382
0:13:56,36 --> 0:13:59,48
the Hallmark Channel.


383
0:13:59,48 --> 0:14:1,6
You know, because kids,
they have moms.


384
0:14:1,6 --> 0:14:5,42
They overhear a lot of stuff
their moms like.


385
0:14:5,42 --> 0:14:8,816
That's the thinking behind
me hiring a child.


386
0:14:8,816 --> 0:14:10,44
JON GABRUS: I'm standing right
here, Mr. [INAUDIBLE].


387
0:14:10,44 --> 0:14:12,9
ALLAN MCLEOD: Oh, yeah.


388
0:14:12,9 --> 0:14:12,29
JON GABRUS: Hi.


389
0:14:12,29 --> 0:14:13,46
My name's Danny.


390
0:14:13,46 --> 0:14:15,39
I run the Hallmark
Channel now.


391
0:14:15,39 --> 0:14:21,29
And we're gonna, my first
idea, my first idea is--


392
0:14:21,29 --> 0:14:25,97
aw, I have a nervous boner.


393
0:14:25,97 --> 0:14:27,13
I have a nervous boner.


394
0:14:27,13 --> 0:14:29,68
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: That is a
huge boner for a little boy.


395
0:14:29,68 --> 0:14:31,1
JON GABRUS: Thank you.


396
0:14:31,1 --> 0:14:33,58
Thank you so much.


397
0:14:33,58 --> 0:14:34,64
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: That
was not a compliment.


398
0:14:34,64 --> 0:14:35,92
It's more bewilderment.


399
0:14:35,92 --> 0:14:37,34
JON GABRUS: It's a compliment
for me.


400
0:14:37,34 --> 0:14:40,86
JOE WENGERT: Is your nervous
boner a programming idea?


401
0:14:40,86 --> 0:14:41,72
JON GABRUS: Yeah.


402
0:14:41,72 --> 0:14:42,33
Of course.


403
0:14:42,33 --> 0:14:44,58
That's why I did it.


404
0:14:44,58 --> 0:14:48,75
We're going to have a two-hour
boner block on Thursdays.


405
0:14:48,75 --> 0:14:51,7
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Rob Lowe
could play the boner.


406
0:14:51,7 --> 0:14:51,45
JON GABRUS: Yeah.


407
0:14:51,45 --> 0:14:53,57
Who's that?


408
0:14:53,57 --> 0:14:54,68
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Oh, he's an
actor that does a lot of


409
0:14:54,68 --> 0:14:54,85
Hallmark movies.


410
0:14:54,85 --> 0:14:55,11
JON GABRUS: Oh, all right.


411
0:14:55,11 --> 0:14:56,41
ALLAN MCLEOD: He's
a great guy.


412
0:14:56,41 --> 0:14:56,71
I'll call him.


413
0:14:56,71 --> 0:14:56,764
JON GABRUS: Cool.


414
0:14:56,764 --> 0:14:57,16
I'm a kid.


415
0:14:57,16 --> 0:14:59,19
So I'm not going to know
that reference.


416
0:14:59,19 --> 0:15:3,71
Um, my other idea was
we could have no


417
0:15:3,71 --> 0:15:6,99
commercials and free pizza.


418
0:15:6,99 --> 0:15:7,7
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Boss?


419
0:15:7,7 --> 0:15:9,37
I got to call bullshit here.


420
0:15:9,37 --> 0:15:10,0
ALLAN MCLEOD: Whoa.


421
0:15:10,0 --> 0:15:11,9
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Because I
got a boner in a meeting last


422
0:15:11,9 --> 0:15:14,14
week, and you told me
was inappropriate.


423
0:15:14,14 --> 0:15:16,47
ALLAN MCLEOD: Because
you're an adult man.


424
0:15:16,47 --> 0:15:19,67
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Yeah, it
was a confident boner.


425
0:15:19,67 --> 0:15:22,64
ALLAN MCLEOD: Well, this is a
nervous child's boner, OK?


426
0:15:22,64 --> 0:15:23,57
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: I'm just
pissed because his


427
0:15:23,57 --> 0:15:25,92
is bigger than mine.


428
0:15:25,92 --> 0:15:27,65
JOE WENGERT: Maybe we need,
like, to have a meeting so we


429
0:15:27,65 --> 0:15:31,2
know which boners are OK and
which boners are sort of


430
0:15:31,2 --> 0:15:32,24
outside the lines.


431
0:15:32,24 --> 0:15:35,48
JON GABRUS: I guess as your new
CEO of Hallmark Channel, I


432
0:15:35,48 --> 0:15:36,89
might as well have
that meeting now?


433
0:15:36,89 --> 0:15:38,75
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Well you know
what would help me a lot?


434
0:15:38,75 --> 0:15:41,96
Is a lot of times, I'm not cc:ed
on the company email, so


435
0:15:41,96 --> 0:15:45,21
I only had like a half chub at
the Friday meeting last week.


436
0:15:45,21 --> 0:15:45,99
Because I wasn't ready.


437
0:15:45,99 --> 0:15:47,74
I didn't know it was going on.


438
0:15:47,74 --> 0:15:50,16
And I was even also like,
are they appropriate?


439
0:15:50,16 --> 0:15:51,74
Is it inappropriate?


440
0:15:51,74 --> 0:15:55,7
ALLAN MCLEOD: Well, we all
emailed each other about that.


441
0:15:55,7 --> 0:15:59,35
And we're going to have
to let you go.


442
0:15:59,35 --> 0:16:2,43
The half chub is not
appropriate.


443
0:16:2,43 --> 0:16:6,54
At least get it all the way
up or nothing at all.


444
0:16:6,54 --> 0:16:8,28
JON GABRUS: Right?


445
0:16:8,28 --> 0:16:8,475
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Guys?


446
0:16:8,475 --> 0:16:12,11
I can't have my marriage and my
job end the same week for


447
0:16:12,11 --> 0:16:13,36
the same reason.


448
0:16:13,36 --> 0:16:16,5



449
0:16:16,5 --> 0:16:17,43
ALLAN MCLEOD: Change is good.


450
0:16:17,43 --> 0:16:18,25
Embrace it.


451
0:16:18,25 --> 0:16:18,92
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: All right.


452
0:16:18,92 --> 0:16:19,64
Good luck, kid.


453
0:16:19,64 --> 0:16:22,52
You're gonna need it.


454
0:16:22,52 --> 0:16:24,4
Slam!


455
0:16:24,4 --> 0:16:25,24
ALLAN MCLEOD: He always
does that.


456
0:16:25,24 --> 0:16:28,97
Every time he leaves, he closes
the door, he says slam.


457
0:16:28,97 --> 0:16:30,72
That was another reason.


458
0:16:30,72 --> 0:16:32,47
We can't fire him on
those grounds.


459
0:16:32,47 --> 0:16:33,99
JON GABRUS: I can't believe we
fired such an awesome dude.


460
0:16:33,99 --> 0:16:37,1
OK, idea number three, now just
try to get this through


461
0:16:37,1 --> 0:16:39,9
your thick, fucking skull, OK?


462
0:16:39,9 --> 0:16:40,94
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: What
was idea number two?


463
0:16:40,94 --> 0:16:42,0
JON GABRUS: Idea number
two was no


464
0:16:42,0 --> 0:16:43,28
commercials and free pizza.


465
0:16:43,28 --> 0:16:44,88
You don't remember it because
you were too busy thinking


466
0:16:44,88 --> 0:16:45,975
about your own boner.


467
0:16:45,975 --> 0:16:48,5
DREW DIFONZO MARKS:
He's right.


468
0:16:48,5 --> 0:16:49,23
JON GABRUS: All right.


469
0:16:49,23 --> 0:16:50,88
Let's table the boners
for now.


470
0:16:50,88 --> 0:16:53,57
What we're talking about is free
pizza, no commercials.


471
0:16:53,57 --> 0:16:55,74
Because commercials suck,
pizza is awesome.


472
0:16:55,74 --> 0:16:58,82
So how can we capitalize
on that?


473
0:16:58,82 --> 0:17:1,22
ALLAN MCLEOD: Pizza
commercials.


474
0:17:1,22 --> 0:17:2,47
JON GABRUS: All right.


475
0:17:2,47 --> 0:17:4,44



476
0:17:4,44 --> 0:17:7,99
JOE WENGERT: Only commercials
for pizza?


477
0:17:7,99 --> 0:17:7,69
ALLAN MCLEOD: Why not?


478
0:17:7,69 --> 0:17:9,93
I'm trying to-- we
have to have--


479
0:17:9,93 --> 0:17:10,79
JON GABRUS: We're just
spit-balling here


480
0:17:10,79 --> 0:17:13,16
TONI RAMOS: I know we're
tabling the boner talk.


481
0:17:13,16 --> 0:17:15,9
But what about--


482
0:17:15,9 --> 0:17:17,89
I feel weird saying this
in front of a kid.


483
0:17:17,89 --> 0:17:23,589
But getting wet, or moist, or
maybe laughing too hard, or


484
0:17:23,589 --> 0:17:25,18
hitting the edge of
a desk and wetting


485
0:17:25,18 --> 0:17:27,6
yourself a little bit--


486
0:17:27,6 --> 0:17:29,681
does that count as like
a boner time?


487
0:17:29,681 --> 0:17:30,6
JON GABRUS: Are those things
that could happen to people?


488
0:17:30,6 --> 0:17:33,815
TONI RAMOS: To women who
have had children, yes.


489
0:17:33,815 --> 0:17:35,592
Yes, it can.


490
0:17:35,592 --> 0:17:37,155
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: They
can hit a table and wet


491
0:17:37,155 --> 0:17:37,818
themselves?


492
0:17:37,818 --> 0:17:40,676
TONI RAMOS: If you
hit a part, yes.


493
0:17:40,676 --> 0:17:42,1
Yes, it can.


494
0:17:42,1 --> 0:17:46,46
If you hit a table too hard,
it blows out a little bit.


495
0:17:46,46 --> 0:17:46,62
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Sweetheart,


496
0:17:46,62 --> 0:17:48,99
now, close your eyes?


497
0:17:48,99 --> 0:17:50,24
TONI RAMOS: OK.


498
0:17:50,24 --> 0:17:50,98
DREW DIFONZO MARKS:
Now, hold on.


499
0:17:50,98 --> 0:17:52,74
I rearranged the furniture
a little bit.


500
0:17:52,74 --> 0:17:55,4
TONI RAMOS: Why would
you do that?


501
0:17:55,4 --> 0:17:55,215
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Hold on.


502
0:17:55,215 --> 0:17:55,67
It's OK.


503
0:17:55,67 --> 0:17:57,11
Just keep walking.


504
0:17:57,11 --> 0:17:58,9
I got you something.


505
0:17:58,9 --> 0:17:58,59
TONI RAMOS: Oh!


506
0:17:58,59 --> 0:18:0,15
Oh.


507
0:18:0,15 --> 0:18:0,88
DREW DIFONZO MARKS:
Did you come?


508
0:18:0,88 --> 0:18:1,51
What happened?


509
0:18:1,51 --> 0:18:4,926
TONI RAMOS: Whoa, definitely
didn't come.


510
0:18:4,926 --> 0:18:14,21
[APPLAUSE]


511
0:18:14,21 --> 0:18:15,74
JON GABRUS: Mr. Smith,
I wanted to talk to


512
0:18:15,74 --> 0:18:17,62
you about your son.


513
0:18:17,62 --> 0:18:18,875
I ran all the tests
that I could.


514
0:18:18,875 --> 0:18:22,685
And I feel like the only real
answer left to this issue is


515
0:18:22,685 --> 0:18:24,88
that I don't think
he can blink.


516
0:18:24,88 --> 0:18:27,85



517
0:18:27,85 --> 0:18:29,1
I don't think he--


518
0:18:29,1 --> 0:18:31,98
the reason his eyes are drying
out so rapidly is that he


519
0:18:31,98 --> 0:18:35,23
doesn't know how to blink.


520
0:18:35,23 --> 0:18:37,22
ALLAN MCLEOD: That's not usually
a thing you have to


521
0:18:37,22 --> 0:18:38,2
teach somebody.


522
0:18:38,2 --> 0:18:39,8
JON GABRUS: Yeah, no shit.


523
0:18:39,8 --> 0:18:41,98
And that's why I'm
freaking out, OK?


524
0:18:41,98 --> 0:18:43,48
I'm a doctor.


525
0:18:43,48 --> 0:18:47,33
I'm a doctor of eyes, as we call
it in the medical term,


526
0:18:47,33 --> 0:18:49,93
an eye doctor.


527
0:18:49,93 --> 0:18:50,77
And now I've got this.


528
0:18:50,77 --> 0:18:52,57
I've never seen this before.


529
0:18:52,57 --> 0:18:54,74
Blinking is something we
instinctually do--


530
0:18:54,74 --> 0:18:56,786
I did like the, [SNAP].


531
0:18:56,786 --> 0:18:59,422
You didn't blink either.


532
0:18:59,422 --> 0:18:59,9
ALLAN MCLEOD: Uh, I just--


533
0:18:59,9 --> 0:19:1,36
I didn't want to
miss anything.


534
0:19:1,36 --> 0:19:3,36
I didn't want to
miss anything.


535
0:19:3,36 --> 0:19:3,512
JON GABRUS: [LAUGHING]


536
0:19:3,512 --> 0:19:4,53
Are you--


537
0:19:4,53 --> 0:19:6,81
a strange man just threw a punch
in your face, and you


538
0:19:6,81 --> 0:19:8,17
didn't even react at all.


539
0:19:8,17 --> 0:19:9,3
ALLAN MCLEOD: Do it
again, I'll blink.


540
0:19:9,3 --> 0:19:10,2
I'll blink.


541
0:19:10,2 --> 0:19:10,93
JON GABRUS: You didn't blink.


542
0:19:10,93 --> 0:19:11,234
ALLAN MCLEOD: Oh, wait!


543
0:19:11,234 --> 0:19:11,31
Wait!


544
0:19:11,31 --> 0:19:13,46
JON GABRUS: Shit,
it's hereditary.


545
0:19:13,46 --> 0:19:16,76
It got to be on the
Y chromosome.


546
0:19:16,76 --> 0:19:19,74
ALLAN MCLEOD: Yeah, it's
probably on the Y chromosome.


547
0:19:19,74 --> 0:19:20,57
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Dr. Douglas?


548
0:19:20,57 --> 0:19:21,67
JON GABRUS: [LAUGHING]


549
0:19:21,67 --> 0:19:22,56
Uh-huh.


550
0:19:22,56 --> 0:19:23,27
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Sorry
to interrupt.


551
0:19:23,27 --> 0:19:24,86
Your wife just called
and left a message.


552
0:19:24,86 --> 0:19:26,29
She wants you to call her as
soon as you get a chance.


553
0:19:26,29 --> 0:19:27,135
Thanks.


554
0:19:27,135 --> 0:19:28,955
Bye.


555
0:19:28,955 --> 0:19:30,92
ALLAN MCLEOD: Your secretary--


556
0:19:30,92 --> 0:19:32,84
JON GABRUS: I'm just now
noticing that my secretary


557
0:19:32,84 --> 0:19:35,42
I've had for the last
18 years might never


558
0:19:35,42 --> 0:19:37,14
have blinked before.


559
0:19:37,14 --> 0:19:38,2
ALLAN MCLEOD: Gosh--


560
0:19:38,2 --> 0:19:40,46
JON GABRUS: I'm always
looking right here.


561
0:19:40,46 --> 0:19:40,998
ALLAN MCLEOD: OK, OK.


562
0:19:40,998 --> 0:19:41,95
I get that.


563
0:19:41,95 --> 0:19:42,79
JON GABRUS: I got you right
in the center there.


564
0:19:42,79 --> 0:19:43,85
My bad.


565
0:19:43,85 --> 0:19:44,72
I didn't mean to touch
a stranger.


566
0:19:44,72 --> 0:19:46,59
You didn't react at
all, again, dude.


567
0:19:46,59 --> 0:19:48,84
ALLAN MCLEOD: Well, what
do you expect, my


568
0:19:48,84 --> 0:19:50,19
pecs to blink now?


569
0:19:50,19 --> 0:19:51,54
Look, I'm working on it.


570
0:19:51,54 --> 0:19:55,19
My son stares at me creepily
all the time,


571
0:19:55,19 --> 0:19:56,91
even when he's asleep.


572
0:19:56,91 --> 0:19:57,71
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Daddy?


573
0:19:57,71 --> 0:19:58,15
Daddy?


574
0:19:58,15 --> 0:20:0,2
Daddy?


575
0:20:0,2 --> 0:20:1,71
ALLAN MCLEOD: No, it's me son.


576
0:20:1,71 --> 0:20:2,55
Yes.


577
0:20:2,55 --> 0:20:3,78
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: I know.


578
0:20:3,78 --> 0:20:6,2
I've just been waiting a long
time for this optometry


579
0:20:6,2 --> 0:20:7,45
appointment.


580
0:20:7,45 --> 0:20:10,11



581
0:20:10,11 --> 0:20:12,71
ALLAN MCLEOD: We're going to
get you those glasses.


582
0:20:12,71 --> 0:20:16,1
JON GABRUS: That's very cute,
but we're called eye doctors.


583
0:20:16,1 --> 0:20:17,45
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Why do
I need an eye doctor?


584
0:20:17,45 --> 0:20:19,135
What's wrong with my eyes?


585
0:20:19,135 --> 0:20:20,19
[INAUDIBLE] do anything.


586
0:20:20,19 --> 0:20:21,1
JON GABRUS: There's nothing
technically


587
0:20:21,1 --> 0:20:22,7
wrong with your eyes.


588
0:20:22,7 --> 0:20:24,7
It's more your lid.


589
0:20:24,7 --> 0:20:25,77
DREW DIFONZO MARKS:
The thing above my


590
0:20:25,77 --> 0:20:27,32
eyes that does nothing?


591
0:20:27,32 --> 0:20:29,49
JON GABRUS: Well,
yeah, for most--


592
0:20:29,49 --> 0:20:32,7
holy shit, you're really
creeping me out.


593
0:20:32,7 --> 0:20:33,99
That's some Michael
Caine shit.


594
0:20:33,99 --> 0:20:38,46



595
0:20:38,46 --> 0:20:39,52
[LAUGHS]


596
0:20:39,52 --> 0:20:42,79
Did you just fake blink
after I swung at you


597
0:20:42,79 --> 0:20:44,35
to try to fit in?


598
0:20:44,35 --> 0:20:47,376
ALLAN MCLEOD: Yeah, why don't
you bust my balls about it?


599
0:20:47,376 --> 0:20:49,56
JON GABRUS: I feel like
my soul is being--


600
0:20:49,56 --> 0:20:52,4
JOE WENGERT: Dr. Gabrus, we
heard about your complaint.


601
0:20:52,4 --> 0:20:54,66
And there's nothing that we can
really do except to give


602
0:20:54,66 --> 0:20:56,664
you this handgun.


603
0:20:56,664 --> 0:20:59,52
So if you feel intimidated
by any of your


604
0:20:59,52 --> 0:21:2,62
patients or their parents--


605
0:21:2,62 --> 0:21:4,13
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: So you're
going to do this to make my


606
0:21:4,13 --> 0:21:5,97
eyes react in any way at all?


607
0:21:5,97 --> 0:21:7,25
JON GABRUS: Yeah.


608
0:21:7,25 --> 0:21:8,21
What's wrong with you, kid?


609
0:21:8,21 --> 0:21:10,35
Why aren't you afraid of
a fucking gun, man?


610
0:21:10,35 --> 0:21:12,14
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Fire
it in the air near me.


611
0:21:12,14 --> 0:21:14,24
See if anything happens
at all.


612
0:21:14,24 --> 0:21:15,7
Not a thing.


613
0:21:15,7 --> 0:21:16,62
ALLAN MCLEOD: [YELLING]


614
0:21:16,62 --> 0:21:17,54
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Oh!


615
0:21:17,54 --> 0:21:18,46
Daddy!


616
0:21:18,46 --> 0:21:19,4
Daddy, no!


617
0:21:19,4 --> 0:21:21,41
I'd cry, but I can't
close my eyes.


618
0:21:21,41 --> 0:21:21,93
MIKE LEFFINGWELL:
I heard a shot.


619
0:21:21,93 --> 0:21:23,25
What's going on?


620
0:21:23,25 --> 0:21:24,725
JON GABRUS: Jesus Christ, all
of you, get out of here.


621
0:21:24,725 --> 0:21:26,22
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Your wife said
the recycling's going to


622
0:21:26,22 --> 0:21:28,45
get picked up on Thursday
this week.


623
0:21:28,45 --> 0:21:29,37
JON GABRUS: Thursday?


624
0:21:29,37 --> 0:21:30,56
No.


625
0:21:30,56 --> 0:21:31,96
Sorry, I'm losing--


626
0:21:31,96 --> 0:21:33,21
I'm cracking up here.


627
0:21:33,21 --> 0:21:35,1
All right.


628
0:21:35,1 --> 0:21:37,24
You see, I'm just
an eye doctor.


629
0:21:37,24 --> 0:21:40,64
Are you blinking all now
from being shot?


630
0:21:40,64 --> 0:21:42,97
ALLAN MCLEOD: This is
years of blinks


631
0:21:42,97 --> 0:21:45,62
flashing before my eyes.


632
0:21:45,62 --> 0:21:47,92
JON GABRUS: That's literally
what's happening.


633
0:21:47,92 --> 0:21:49,29
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Teach me
how to do that with those


634
0:21:49,29 --> 0:21:51,22
above eye muscles.


635
0:21:51,22 --> 0:21:52,2
JON GABRUS: Teach you
how to blink?


636
0:21:52,2 --> 0:21:52,49
ALLAN MCLEOD: Son.


637
0:21:52,49 --> 0:21:53,26
JON GABRUS: That was the--


638
0:21:53,26 --> 0:21:53,952
DREW DIFONZO MARKS:
Yes, Daddy.


639
0:21:53,952 --> 0:21:54,9
JON GABRUS: I got the message.


640
0:21:54,9 --> 0:21:57,9
ALLAN MCLEOD: Take my lids.


641
0:21:57,9 --> 0:21:59,72
Take my lids.


642
0:21:59,72 --> 0:22:1,27
Yes, peel them.


643
0:22:1,27 --> 0:22:2,27
Peel them.


644
0:22:2,27 --> 0:22:4,22
DREW DIFONZO MARKS:
This is so gross.


645
0:22:4,22 --> 0:22:7,26
ALLAN MCLEOD: Attach my
lids to my son's eyes.


646
0:22:7,26 --> 0:22:10,78
JON GABRUS: I honestly don't
think that's the issue.


647
0:22:10,78 --> 0:22:12,761
ALLAN MCLEOD: You've
got to try.


648
0:22:12,761 --> 0:22:13,6
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: But,
Daddy, I have eyelids.


649
0:22:13,6 --> 0:22:16,31
I just don't know
how to use them.


650
0:22:16,31 --> 0:22:18,67
ALLAN MCLEOD: Maybe you
need double lids.


651
0:22:18,67 --> 0:22:21,42
More lids, please.


652
0:22:21,42 --> 0:22:21,63
MIKE LEFFINGWELL:
Jon, wake up!


653
0:22:21,63 --> 0:22:22,52
Wake up, Jon.


654
0:22:22,52 --> 0:22:22,855
Jon, wake up!


655
0:22:22,855 --> 0:22:23,19
Wake up!


656
0:22:23,19 --> 0:22:23,38
JON GABRUS: Oh!


657
0:22:23,38 --> 0:22:23,68
[GASPING]


658
0:22:23,68 --> 0:22:25,21
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: You were
talking in your sleep.


659
0:22:25,21 --> 0:22:25,83
JON GABRUS: Oh, no.


660
0:22:25,83 --> 0:22:27,29
Oh, no.


661
0:22:27,29 --> 0:22:28,63
Is it Thursday?


662
0:22:28,63 --> 0:22:31,41
The recycling, oh, my
god, the recycling--


663
0:22:31,41 --> 0:22:32,31
oh, fuck.


664
0:22:32,31 --> 0:22:33,575
I was supposed to put it out.


665
0:22:33,575 --> 0:22:33,742
No.


666
0:22:33,742 --> 0:22:33,91
Wait.


667
0:22:33,91 --> 0:22:37,32
That wasn't the thrust
of my dream.


668
0:22:37,32 --> 0:22:39,61
That's all I remember.


669
0:22:39,61 --> 0:22:39,98
Oh, fuck.


670
0:22:39,98 --> 0:22:41,17
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: What
a weird boner.


671
0:22:41,17 --> 0:22:45,104
JON GABRUS: It's
a normal boner.


672
0:22:45,104 --> 0:22:51,79
[APPLAUSE]


673
0:22:51,79 --> 0:22:54,94
JOE WENGERT: So we've narrowed
down the names for the


674
0:22:54,94 --> 0:22:58,42
Saturday morning cartoon block
down to two names.


675
0:22:58,42 --> 0:23:2,29
We're either going to call it
Saturday Morning Fun Time or


676
0:23:2,29 --> 0:23:9,18
Toonami, to sort of evoke the
name of a natural disaster


677
0:23:9,18 --> 0:23:9,92
that would kill--


678
0:23:9,92 --> 0:23:10,78
DREW DIFONZO MARKS:
Oh, I got it.


679
0:23:10,78 --> 0:23:12,38
JOE WENGERT: --maybe
millions of people.


680
0:23:12,38 --> 0:23:14,32
So Saturday Morning Fun Time.


681
0:23:14,32 --> 0:23:15,3
DREW DIFONZO MARKS:
Or Toonami.


682
0:23:15,3 --> 0:23:16,56
JOE WENGERT: Or Toonami.


683
0:23:16,56 --> 0:23:18,24
Also--


684
0:23:18,24 --> 0:23:18,7
I'm sorry.


685
0:23:18,7 --> 0:23:20,88
There was a third option that
I keep blanking about.


686
0:23:20,88 --> 0:23:24,21
Cartoon 9/11 was another
[INTERPOSING VOICES].


687
0:23:24,21 --> 0:23:25,57
So one of those three--


688
0:23:25,57 --> 0:23:30,61
and I can't figure out which
ones to eliminate because


689
0:23:30,61 --> 0:23:32,79
they're all very good.


690
0:23:32,79 --> 0:23:35,14
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Good's
a subjective term.


691
0:23:35,14 --> 0:23:38,18
You've kind of pointed out the
only problem with it, saying


692
0:23:38,18 --> 0:23:39,88
that it invokes a natural
disaster.


693
0:23:39,88 --> 0:23:41,16
JOE WENGERT: Yeah, it's a
little too on the nose.


694
0:23:41,16 --> 0:23:44,2
Cartoon Fun Time is just like,
the kids are going to be like,


695
0:23:44,2 --> 0:23:46,27
this is insulting to us.


696
0:23:46,27 --> 0:23:48,53
Let us decide if it's
fun or not.


697
0:23:48,53 --> 0:23:49,78
And we know it's cartoons.


698
0:23:49,78 --> 0:23:53,77



699
0:23:53,77 --> 0:23:54,92
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Honestly,
Joe, I would say the second


700
0:23:54,92 --> 0:23:57,73
and the third ones are just
borderline offensive, OK?


701
0:23:57,73 --> 0:24:0,625
Like those children could have
had family members that died


702
0:24:0,625 --> 0:24:3,88
in the tsunami or many parents
that were in 9/11, OK?


703
0:24:3,88 --> 0:24:5,62
And that's just going to really
harsh-- not make them


704
0:24:5,62 --> 0:24:7,35
want to watch.


705
0:24:7,35 --> 0:24:8,33
Fun time is fun for everybody.


706
0:24:8,33 --> 0:24:10,6
JOE WENGERT: This way, they'll
sort of deal with their


707
0:24:10,6 --> 0:24:14,24
issues, I feel like, in a fun
environment with their


708
0:24:14,24 --> 0:24:15,59
favorite characters.


709
0:24:15,59 --> 0:24:19,32
JON GABRUS: Hey, boss, I came
up with a few others.


710
0:24:19,32 --> 0:24:21,3
I should probably read them to
you, because I wrote them in


711
0:24:21,3 --> 0:24:22,28
such sloppy handwriting.


712
0:24:22,28 --> 0:24:24,44



713
0:24:24,44 --> 0:24:27,55
Japanese Internment Cartoons.


714
0:24:27,55 --> 0:24:28,41
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: You had
to go out of your way


715
0:24:28,41 --> 0:24:30,37
to think that up.


716
0:24:30,37 --> 0:24:33,8
That's just going
for offensive.


717
0:24:33,8 --> 0:24:35,58
JON GABRUS: The Funenburg
Trials.


718
0:24:35,58 --> 0:24:38,9
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: At least
there's an attempt at wordplay


719
0:24:38,9 --> 0:24:39,23
in that one.


720
0:24:39,23 --> 0:24:40,535
JON GABRUS: And this one
is just called Lynch.


721
0:24:40,535 --> 0:24:44,61



722
0:24:44,61 --> 0:24:46,43
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: It's
just offensive.


723
0:24:46,43 --> 0:24:49,158
And no one would even know
that's a cartoon show.


724
0:24:49,158 --> 0:24:50,592
JON GABRUS: Ahh!


725
0:24:50,592 --> 0:24:51,7
All right.


726
0:24:51,7 --> 0:24:53,16
I'll take these back, put
them in the oven for


727
0:24:53,16 --> 0:24:54,86
a little bit longer.


728
0:24:54,86 --> 0:24:55,28
Ovens!


729
0:24:55,28 --> 0:24:55,39
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: No.


730
0:24:55,39 --> 0:24:58,51
No, I know where you're
going with that.


731
0:24:58,51 --> 0:24:58,98
JON GABRUS: OK, fair enough.


732
0:24:58,98 --> 0:25:0,4
Sorry, boss.


733
0:25:0,4 --> 0:25:1,415
I tried.


734
0:25:1,415 --> 0:25:4,94
We got to find something better
than Saturday Fun Time.


735
0:25:4,94 --> 0:25:6,14
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Look, I'm
not saying Saturday Fun Time


736
0:25:6,14 --> 0:25:8,1
is perfect, but something
like Action Packed


737
0:25:8,1 --> 0:25:9,53
Hour, or Fun Zone.


738
0:25:9,53 --> 0:25:10,3
Or Animation--


739
0:25:10,3 --> 0:25:11,88
JOE WENGERT: Action
Packed Hour?


740
0:25:11,88 --> 0:25:12,79
DREW DIFONZO MARKS:
Action Pack Hour.


741
0:25:12,79 --> 0:25:14,68
JOE WENGERT: OK, that's
very rude of you.


742
0:25:14,68 --> 0:25:15,54
OK?


743
0:25:15,54 --> 0:25:17,3
DREW DIFONZO MARKS:
How is that rude?


744
0:25:17,3 --> 0:25:19,14
JOE WENGERT: You want to know--
you think that kids are


745
0:25:19,14 --> 0:25:20,85
going to want to tune into
something that's going to


746
0:25:20,85 --> 0:25:26,41
remind them of car crashes
and buildings imploding?


747
0:25:26,41 --> 0:25:27,26
Two actions?


748
0:25:27,26 --> 0:25:29,68
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: I think
9/11 Hour is a little more


749
0:25:29,68 --> 0:25:32,88
buildings imploding than
Action Pack Hour.


750
0:25:32,88 --> 0:25:34,64
JOE WENGERT: Well, most of the
cartoons are going to be


751
0:25:34,64 --> 0:25:36,93
airing between 9:00
AM and 11:00 AM.


752
0:25:36,93 --> 0:25:39,53
I don't understand what the
problem is with that.


753
0:25:39,53 --> 0:25:40,63
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: That's
a stretch at best.


754
0:25:40,63 --> 0:25:41,5
JOE WENGERT: What?


755
0:25:41,5 --> 0:25:42,2
DREW DIFONZO MARKS:
That's a stretch.


756
0:25:42,2 --> 0:25:45,91
JOE WENGERT: Nobody's watching
the 8 o'clock cartoons.


757
0:25:45,91 --> 0:25:47,26
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Look,
I'm just saying--


758
0:25:47,26 --> 0:25:50,25
even if that reference went over
the kids heads, let's say


759
0:25:50,25 --> 0:25:52,49
the kids are too young for 9/11,
the parents are going to


760
0:25:52,49 --> 0:25:54,46
be up, you know, making
breakfast for the kids.


761
0:25:54,46 --> 0:25:55,25
And they're going to watch it.


762
0:25:55,25 --> 0:25:57,3
And adults will be
offended by it.


763
0:25:57,3 --> 0:25:57,81
It's just something--


764
0:25:57,81 --> 0:26:0,33
JOE WENGERT: Those adults need
to find something better to do


765
0:26:0,33 --> 0:26:5,1
with their time, I think, than
watch cartoons all morning.


766
0:26:5,1 --> 0:26:6,18
Take care--


767
0:26:6,18 --> 0:26:7,82
take care of your kids.


768
0:26:7,82 --> 0:26:10,69
Focus on your career
and your future.


769
0:26:10,69 --> 0:26:11,41
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: All right.


770
0:26:11,41 --> 0:26:13,71
Let me just run a little
test by you.


771
0:26:13,71 --> 0:26:15,69
You tell me which of these
you think is better.


772
0:26:15,69 --> 0:26:17,96
And I'm just going to go with
the line of logic I think


773
0:26:17,96 --> 0:26:18,76
you're using.


774
0:26:18,76 --> 0:26:21,4
OK, let's go with Animation
Station--


775
0:26:21,4 --> 0:26:21,61
JOE WENGERT: Love it.


776
0:26:21,61 --> 0:26:23,67
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Or
just, Holocaust Hour.


777
0:26:23,67 --> 0:26:24,61
JOE WENGERT: Super love it.


778
0:26:24,61 --> 0:26:25,33
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: No!


779
0:26:25,33 --> 0:26:26,24
JOE WENGERT: Wow.


780
0:26:26,24 --> 0:26:28,53
Now, I got a dilemma again.


781
0:26:28,53 --> 0:26:29,95
I don't know which
one to take.


782
0:26:29,95 --> 0:26:30,54
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: No.


783
0:26:30,54 --> 0:26:31,1
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Excuse me.


784
0:26:31,1 --> 0:26:31,765
I'm sorry to interrupt.


785
0:26:31,765 --> 0:26:35,56
I just had an idea, kind
of a brainstorm.


786
0:26:35,56 --> 0:26:38,47
Hitler had some pretty
good ideas.


787
0:26:38,47 --> 0:26:39,97
I'm sorry, I don't actually
work for this company.


788
0:26:39,97 --> 0:26:42,45
I'm just looking
for a bathroom.


789
0:26:42,45 --> 0:26:43,27
Is there one on this floor?


790
0:26:43,27 --> 0:26:43,47
I'll find it.


791
0:26:43,47 --> 0:26:45,4
JOE WENGERT: Yeah, you just go
down the hall, three doors


792
0:26:45,4 --> 0:26:46,4
down to your right.


793
0:26:46,4 --> 0:26:46,67
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Thank you.


794
0:26:46,67 --> 0:26:49,198
JOE WENGERT: You're welcome.


795
0:26:49,198 --> 0:26:50,53
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Slam.


796
0:26:50,53 --> 0:26:53,9
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: He
always does that.


797
0:26:53,9 --> 0:26:57,36
Look, the cartoons themselves
are G rated, OK?


798
0:26:57,36 --> 0:26:57,67
All right?


799
0:26:57,67 --> 0:26:59,88
They're for all audiences.


800
0:26:59,88 --> 0:27:1,82
Some of them have smart jokes,
because the parents will be


801
0:27:1,82 --> 0:27:2,53
watching, too.


802
0:27:2,53 --> 0:27:4,76
So the material itself
is not--


803
0:27:4,76 --> 0:27:6,38
is geared towards kids.


804
0:27:6,38 --> 0:27:9,0
You want to make sure the title
of the hour is as well.


805
0:27:9,0 --> 0:27:9,77
ALLAN MCLEOD: Guys, guys.


806
0:27:9,77 --> 0:27:10,792
Did you guys hear the news?


807
0:27:10,792 --> 0:27:11,94
DREW DIFONZO MARKS:
What happened?


808
0:27:11,94 --> 0:27:14,51
ALLAN MCLEOD: 1,000 people
just died in a Fun Time


809
0:27:14,51 --> 0:27:15,965
Animation Station accident.


810
0:27:15,965 --> 0:27:19,99



811
0:27:19,99 --> 0:27:20,52
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: All
right, fuck it.


812
0:27:20,52 --> 0:27:22,768
Let's go with Holocaust hour.


813
0:27:22,768 --> 0:27:23,764
JON GABRUS: Thank you guys.


814
0:27:23,764 --> 0:27:25,258
That's our first show.


815
0:27:25,258 --> 0:27:30,24
[APPLAUSE]


816
0:27:30,24 --> 0:27:31,54
JOE WENGERT: OK.


817
0:27:31,54 --> 0:27:34,63
Right now, we're going to bring
out another performer.


818
0:27:34,63 --> 0:27:37,76
He's also a performer from
the UCB Theatre.


819
0:27:37,76 --> 0:27:40,18
And he's got a show coming
on Comedy Central called


820
0:27:40,18 --> 0:27:41,39
"Review." Let's give
a warm welcome


821
0:27:41,39 --> 0:27:43,254
to Andy Daly, everybody.


822
0:27:43,254 --> 0:27:46,698
[APPLAUSE]


823
0:27:46,698 --> 0:27:49,158
ANDY DALY: Thank you.


824
0:27:49,158 --> 0:27:50,408
Thank you very much.


825
0:27:50,408 --> 0:27:53,94



826
0:27:53,94 --> 0:27:54,57
Yeah.


827
0:27:54,57 --> 0:27:56,46
That's a good round
of applause.


828
0:27:56,46 --> 0:27:56,538
MALE SPEAKER: Standing
ovation--


829
0:27:56,538 --> 0:27:58,506
[INAUDIBLE] that.


830
0:27:58,506 --> 0:28:0,165
ANDY DALY: That son of a
bitch just cut me off.


831
0:28:0,165 --> 0:28:3,0
Hey, fuck you, you
piece of shit.


832
0:28:3,0 --> 0:28:3,58
Fuck you.


833
0:28:3,58 --> 0:28:6,224
INTERN: Oh, this is amazing.


834
0:28:6,224 --> 0:28:7,71
ANDY DALY: This guy just
fucked with the wrong


835
0:28:7,71 --> 0:28:8,3
motherfucker.


836
0:28:8,3 --> 0:28:10,12
INTERN: Fuck, yeah,
Mr. MacNeil.


837
0:28:10,12 --> 0:28:11,24
ANDY DALY: Motherfucker,
you just fucked


838
0:28:11,24 --> 0:28:11,79
with the wrong guy.


839
0:28:11,79 --> 0:28:12,7
INTERN: I got your back,
Mr. MacNeil.


840
0:28:12,7 --> 0:28:13,155
ANDY DALY: What the fuck
is the matter with you?


841
0:28:13,155 --> 0:28:14,82
I'm trying to fucking
drive here.


842
0:28:14,82 --> 0:28:16,58
You blow through that
stop sign like that.


843
0:28:16,58 --> 0:28:18,53
You don't fucking do
that to people.


844
0:28:18,53 --> 0:28:20,24
You got a stop sign?


845
0:28:20,24 --> 0:28:21,2
You stop at the fucking
white line.


846
0:28:21,2 --> 0:28:22,13
INTERN: Mr. MacNeil.


847
0:28:22,13 --> 0:28:23,31
ANDY DALY: Oh, yeah.


848
0:28:23,31 --> 0:28:24,23
Yeah, yeah, yeah.


849
0:28:24,23 --> 0:28:25,6
OK.


850
0:28:25,6 --> 0:28:26,17
Hey, asshole.


851
0:28:26,17 --> 0:28:27,44
It looks like something
happened to


852
0:28:27,44 --> 0:28:28,69
your fucking taillight.


853
0:28:28,69 --> 0:28:32,21



854
0:28:32,21 --> 0:28:37,15
What the fuck happened to your
sideview mirror, asshole?


855
0:28:37,15 --> 0:28:38,75
Looks like your blind
spot just got a


856
0:28:38,75 --> 0:28:39,67
little bigger, fuckwit.


857
0:28:39,67 --> 0:28:42,45
What are you going
to do about it?


858
0:28:42,45 --> 0:28:45,6
MALE SPEAKER: You forgot
about something.


859
0:28:45,6 --> 0:28:46,72
Oh.


860
0:28:46,72 --> 0:28:48,64
You forgot one more thing.


861
0:28:48,64 --> 0:28:51,335



862
0:28:51,335 --> 0:28:51,8
Hey!


863
0:28:51,8 --> 0:28:54,87
You ever been in a smash off?


864
0:28:54,87 --> 0:28:56,12
You are now.


865
0:28:56,12 --> 0:28:59,56



866
0:28:59,56 --> 0:29:1,52
ANDY DALY: Smash off!


867
0:29:1,52 --> 0:29:1,98
INTERN: No, no, no.


868
0:29:1,98 --> 0:29:5,136
Mr. MacNeil, no.


869
0:29:5,136 --> 0:29:8,629
No, Mr. MacNeil.


870
0:29:8,629 --> 0:29:9,627
Stop, Mr. MacNeil!


871
0:29:9,627 --> 0:29:13,12
That's my fucking car.


872
0:29:13,12 --> 0:29:15,116
Please, Mr. MacNeil!


873
0:29:15,116 --> 0:29:16,366
Please!


874
0:29:16,366 --> 0:29:18,609



875
0:29:18,609 --> 0:29:19,82
Fucking stop him.


876
0:29:19,82 --> 0:29:23,215
That's my car.


877
0:29:23,215 --> 0:29:24,185
Somebody help me!


878
0:29:24,185 --> 0:29:24,67
[INAUDIBLE]


879
0:29:24,67 --> 0:29:24,882
ANDY DALY: Fuck you.


880
0:29:24,882 --> 0:29:26,86
What are you going to
do now, asshole?


881
0:29:26,86 --> 0:29:31,9
MALE SPEAKER: I will end you.


882
0:29:31,9 --> 0:29:39,47
[APPLAUSE]


883
0:29:39,47 --> 0:29:42,6
ANDY DALY: What the fuck was
that, you may well wonder?


884
0:29:42,6 --> 0:29:45,5
Often, when a clip is shown in
a context like this, it's


885
0:29:45,5 --> 0:29:46,5
explained first and
then shown.


886
0:29:46,5 --> 0:29:49,28
But we'll do it the other way
around where it's shown in


887
0:29:49,28 --> 0:29:51,11
total mystery and then
explained afterward.


888
0:29:51,11 --> 0:29:54,19
I have a show premiering on
Comedy Central soon called


889
0:29:54,19 --> 0:29:57,65
"Review," in which I play
character named Forrest, who


890
0:29:57,65 --> 0:30:2,57
is a critic who reviews not
movies, or food, or books, but


891
0:30:2,57 --> 0:30:3,57
life experiences.


892
0:30:3,57 --> 0:30:8,1
So what's it like to steal,
what's it like to be a racist,


893
0:30:8,1 --> 0:30:10,44
or what's it like to experience
road rage?


894
0:30:10,44 --> 0:30:14,26
And so, as you're now beginning
to piece together


895
0:30:14,26 --> 0:30:17,67
what you just saw,
in that piece--


896
0:30:17,67 --> 0:30:19,446
here's what I would have said.


897
0:30:19,446 --> 0:30:22,71
The character has borrowed his
intern's car to go experience


898
0:30:22,71 --> 0:30:23,83
what it's like to
have road rage.


899
0:30:23,83 --> 0:30:25,33
And the intern comes
along for the ride.


900
0:30:25,33 --> 0:30:27,2
And here is what happens.


901
0:30:27,2 --> 0:30:30,61



902
0:30:30,61 --> 0:30:32,42
So, yeah, right?


903
0:30:32,42 --> 0:30:40,48
[APPLAUSE]


904
0:30:40,48 --> 0:30:42,78
In retrospect it's enjoyable.


905
0:30:42,78 --> 0:30:45,47
So that's it for that.


906
0:30:45,47 --> 0:30:46,38
Now, will you do some
improvising?


907
0:30:46,38 --> 0:30:47,24
JOE WENGERT: Yeah, we're
going to watch


908
0:30:47,24 --> 0:30:48,215
another YouTube video.


909
0:30:48,215 --> 0:30:49,59
And we're going to improvise
off that.


910
0:30:49,59 --> 0:30:51,48
ANDY DALY: Maybe we should
improvise first and then watch


911
0:30:51,48 --> 0:30:55,412
the video that the improvising
is inspired by.


912
0:30:55,412 --> 0:31:4,13
[MUSIC PLAYING]


913
0:31:4,13 --> 0:31:7,6
ROB MENARD: You little
rascals.


914
0:31:7,6 --> 0:31:10,41
You try to control the whole
world for your own benefit


915
0:31:10,41 --> 0:31:14,74
without regard to the needs of
others or future generations.


916
0:31:14,74 --> 0:31:18,41
You demand that we seek your
permission and pay your fees


917
0:31:18,41 --> 0:31:21,74
to exercise our rights or
suffer being beaten with


918
0:31:21,74 --> 0:31:25,5
sticks and shocked with tasers,
which incidentally,


919
0:31:25,5 --> 0:31:28,97
you force us to buy.


920
0:31:28,97 --> 0:31:32,75
You steal our wealth, you tax
our wages, our income, our


921
0:31:32,75 --> 0:31:34,1
transactions.


922
0:31:34,1 --> 0:31:36,73
You're burdening us and our
kids with a debt which can


923
0:31:36,73 --> 0:31:40,91
never be repaid, so that you can
build bombs that you drop


924
0:31:40,91 --> 0:31:44,7
on people on the other side of
the planet while you're safely


925
0:31:44,7 --> 0:31:48,85
sipping champagne well out of
range, so you can eventually


926
0:31:48,85 --> 0:31:51,1
do the same thing to them.


927
0:31:51,1 --> 0:31:53,85
And you got us calling
that freedom.


928
0:31:53,85 --> 0:31:55,69



929
0:31:55,69 --> 0:31:58,28
You've raped the earth,
devastated diversity,


930
0:31:58,28 --> 0:32:0,51
monopolized money.


931
0:32:0,51 --> 0:32:4,18
You poison the air we breathe
and the water we drink.


932
0:32:4,18 --> 0:32:7,82
You made organic food a thing
by ladening the food supply


933
0:32:7,82 --> 0:32:9,7
with chemicals.


934
0:32:9,7 --> 0:32:11,12



935
0:32:11,12 --> 0:32:14,96
And you deny us our rights to
the point of jailing us for


936
0:32:14,96 --> 0:32:16,87
the plants we grow.


937
0:32:16,87 --> 0:32:20,46
You claim to be protecting us
from criminals and enemies by


938
0:32:20,46 --> 0:32:23,96
calling us criminals, acting
like one yourself, and then


939
0:32:23,96 --> 0:32:26,61
needlessly creating enemies
in our name


940
0:32:26,61 --> 0:32:27,86
and with our resources.


941
0:32:27,86 --> 0:32:30,25



942
0:32:30,25 --> 0:32:33,86
You have denied the entire
planet peace in abundance in


943
0:32:33,86 --> 0:32:37,56
order to fulfill your own
psychotic wanton greed and


944
0:32:37,56 --> 0:32:40,19
lust for power.


945
0:32:40,19 --> 0:32:42,65
Then you claim to be the
protector of our rights, but


946
0:32:42,65 --> 0:32:45,86
then you abandon the biggest
and reject the best.


947
0:32:45,86 --> 0:32:49,95
Oh, god, you use deception when
you craft your statutes.


948
0:32:49,95 --> 0:32:52,83
You call them laws to justify
your aggression.


949
0:32:52,83 --> 0:32:56,32
And you cloak it all up in
a great big flag of false


950
0:32:56,32 --> 0:32:57,57
constitutionality.


951
0:32:57,57 --> 0:32:59,25



952
0:32:59,25 --> 0:33:0,88
You rely on fear.


953
0:33:0,88 --> 0:33:3,96
Oh, man, you're experts at it.


954
0:33:3,96 --> 0:33:5,44
You use fear to create
division.


955
0:33:5,44 --> 0:33:6,5
And then ignorance--


956
0:33:6,5 --> 0:33:10,81
you rely on ignorance
to insure obedience.


957
0:33:10,81 --> 0:33:14,43
You've completely perverted
democracy buying politicians,


958
0:33:14,43 --> 0:33:17,49
obstructed justice hijacking
the courts.


959
0:33:17,49 --> 0:33:21,16
You caused us to lose faith
in our own institutions.


960
0:33:21,16 --> 0:33:25,3
And best of all, you hindered
our spiritual growth and the


961
0:33:25,3 --> 0:33:28,59
development of our
consciousness.


962
0:33:28,59 --> 0:33:32,0
In short you've been very,
very, very naughty.


963
0:33:32,0 --> 0:33:35,9



964
0:33:35,9 --> 0:33:37,15
And we know it.


965
0:33:37,15 --> 0:33:48,8



966
0:33:48,8 --> 0:33:53,58
ANDY DALY: So I watched your
online dating video.


967
0:33:53,58 --> 0:33:57,88
I just had some pointers, just
as like an online video dating


968
0:33:57,88 --> 0:33:59,12
consultant.


969
0:33:59,12 --> 0:34:1,98
It's my job to help people get
the most out of the service.


970
0:34:1,98 --> 0:34:2,98
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: That's
what I want.


971
0:34:2,98 --> 0:34:8,2
ANDY DALY: And attract a mate
who's really going to be good


972
0:34:8,2 --> 0:34:11,239
for you but also be someone
that exists.


973
0:34:11,239 --> 0:34:12,639
You know what I mean?


974
0:34:12,639 --> 0:34:13,73
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Well, I
believe there's somebody out


975
0:34:13,73 --> 0:34:16,239
there for everybody.


976
0:34:16,239 --> 0:34:19,489
ANDY DALY: I don't know.


977
0:34:19,489 --> 0:34:20,6
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Is it
the shirt choice?


978
0:34:20,6 --> 0:34:22,989
Because I was in my head about,
like, do I just wear a


979
0:34:22,989 --> 0:34:23,98
solid color?


980
0:34:23,98 --> 0:34:25,46
Or should I do a pattern?


981
0:34:25,46 --> 0:34:27,32
ANDY DALY: It was interesting
to me that the hat seemed to


982
0:34:27,32 --> 0:34:30,949
be made out of the material
that the shirt was.


983
0:34:30,949 --> 0:34:33,95
That suggests a certain
self-sufficiency.


984
0:34:33,95 --> 0:34:36,139
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: It used to be
a hoodie, and then I made


985
0:34:36,139 --> 0:34:39,23
it more economical.


986
0:34:39,23 --> 0:34:42,4
ANDY DALY: I think
I understand.


987
0:34:42,4 --> 0:34:44,929
I would say that there is
somebody out there for the


988
0:34:44,929 --> 0:34:47,9
best version of everyone,
right?


989
0:34:47,9 --> 0:34:49,139
And that's what we want
to put out there.


990
0:34:49,139 --> 0:34:51,86
So your video was, let
me actually ask you.


991
0:34:51,86 --> 0:34:54,535
How long did you feel it was?


992
0:34:54,535 --> 0:34:56,929
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Oh, god.


993
0:34:56,929 --> 0:34:58,3
I mean this, can't be right.


994
0:34:58,3 --> 0:35:0,62
But it must have been like
45 seconds or something.


995
0:35:0,62 --> 0:35:4,13
Just like, it just flew by.


996
0:35:4,13 --> 0:35:4,575
ANDY DALY: Fascinating.


997
0:35:4,575 --> 0:35:5,59
MIKE LEFFINGWELL:
Like, a minute?


998
0:35:5,59 --> 0:35:7,26
ANDY DALY: That's fascinating
that you would say that.


999
0:35:7,26 --> 0:35:9,9
It was three hours and
25 minutes long.


1000
0:35:9,9 --> 0:35:10,5
MIKE LEFFINGWELL:
Was it really?


1001
0:35:10,5 --> 0:35:13,1
ANDY DALY: It really was.


1002
0:35:13,1 --> 0:35:14,36
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Once you
just deep dive into your


1003
0:35:14,36 --> 0:35:18,21
heart, it's like,
[MAKES SOUND EFFECT].


1004
0:35:18,21 --> 0:35:19,11
ANDY DALY: Yeah.


1005
0:35:19,11 --> 0:35:20,55
It was--


1006
0:35:20,55 --> 0:35:24,47
it covered a wide range of
topics, questionable


1007
0:35:24,47 --> 0:35:30,52
interpretations of
history, science?


1008
0:35:30,52 --> 0:35:32,27
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Yeah, I mean,
I feel like I just kind


1009
0:35:32,27 --> 0:35:34,1
of want to put myself out
there as much as--


1010
0:35:34,1 --> 0:35:35,56
cast a wide net.


1011
0:35:35,56 --> 0:35:41,14
And then just kind of see what
kind of woman fish jumps into


1012
0:35:41,14 --> 0:35:43,17
the net and is like, take
me out of the water


1013
0:35:43,17 --> 0:35:45,79
where I can't breathe.


1014
0:35:45,79 --> 0:35:49,54
ANDY DALY: That doesn't
sound great.


1015
0:35:49,54 --> 0:35:51,76
JON GABRUS: I've watched
your video five times.


1016
0:35:51,76 --> 0:35:53,11
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Really?


1017
0:35:53,11 --> 0:35:54,46
JON GABRUS: Yeah.


1018
0:35:54,46 --> 0:35:55,8
You seem amazing.


1019
0:35:55,8 --> 0:35:57,61
I agree with everything.


1020
0:35:57,61 --> 0:35:59,4
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Oh,
yeah, yeah, yeah.


1021
0:35:59,4 --> 0:36:2,19
JON GABRUS: Soup to
nuts, all of it--


1022
0:36:2,19 --> 0:36:4,21
you're a genius.


1023
0:36:4,21 --> 0:36:6,21
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: So you believe
that the Declaration


1024
0:36:6,21 --> 0:36:8,46
of Independence was actually
signed by dogs.


1025
0:36:8,46 --> 0:36:10,28
JON GABRUS: Yeah.


1026
0:36:10,28 --> 0:36:12,89
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: That the
framers of the Constitution--


1027
0:36:12,89 --> 0:36:13,77
JON GABRUS: Were dogs.


1028
0:36:13,77 --> 0:36:15,79
They were dogs, and
they had dogs.


1029
0:36:15,79 --> 0:36:17,27
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: That
we came from dogs.


1030
0:36:17,27 --> 0:36:18,57
JON GABRUS: We were all
originally dogs.


1031
0:36:18,57 --> 0:36:21,2
Yeah, I think that was the most
important message that


1032
0:36:21,2 --> 0:36:21,99
you had there.


1033
0:36:21,99 --> 0:36:24,76
Because I always have dreams
at night that I'm a Boston


1034
0:36:24,76 --> 0:36:27,44
terrier, urinating on
various things.


1035
0:36:27,44 --> 0:36:28,2
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Oh!


1036
0:36:28,2 --> 0:36:29,67
I have a dream almost--


1037
0:36:29,67 --> 0:36:31,72
at least once a week where
I'm a various thing


1038
0:36:31,72 --> 0:36:33,816
getting peed on.


1039
0:36:33,816 --> 0:36:34,27
JON GABRUS: Me, too.


1040
0:36:34,27 --> 0:36:36,91
I only sleep once a week
for two hours.


1041
0:36:36,91 --> 0:36:39,16
So I have the dreams that--
well, I can't go to sleep.


1042
0:36:39,16 --> 0:36:41,832
Because just like in your video,
you said everyone's pod


1043
0:36:41,832 --> 0:36:46,21
casting your nightmares out to
various enemies and insurgents


1044
0:36:46,21 --> 0:36:47,18
and stuff like that.


1045
0:36:47,18 --> 0:36:48,29
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Yeah, and
the second you close your


1046
0:36:48,29 --> 0:36:50,34
eyes, that's where they start
targeting the lasers at you.


1047
0:36:50,34 --> 0:36:52,18
And then, boom, you're going
to get blown up.


1048
0:36:52,18 --> 0:36:53,18
JON GABRUS: That's great.


1049
0:36:53,18 --> 0:36:55,9
Can I-- can I have
more napkins?


1050
0:36:55,9 --> 0:36:55,54
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Yeah,
yeah, yeah.


1051
0:36:55,54 --> 0:36:57,62
You have to get some roughage.


1052
0:36:57,62 --> 0:36:58,72
Absolutely.


1053
0:36:58,72 --> 0:37:1,685
JON GABRUS: Look, so, I think
this is going well.


1054
0:37:1,685 --> 0:37:1,97
If you wanna--


1055
0:37:1,97 --> 0:37:3,52
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: I
have to be honest.


1056
0:37:3,52 --> 0:37:4,965
I'm not totally feeling it.


1057
0:37:4,965 --> 0:37:6,69
I'm so sorry.


1058
0:37:6,69 --> 0:37:8,38
You're are an amazing girl.


1059
0:37:8,38 --> 0:37:10,547
I like you.


1060
0:37:10,547 --> 0:37:15,4
[APPLAUSE]


1061
0:37:15,4 --> 0:37:16,65
ALLAN MCLEOD: Yes, yes.


1062
0:37:16,65 --> 0:37:22,36
The missile will fly 5,000 miles
or so and blow up the


1063
0:37:22,36 --> 0:37:23,7
whole continent.


1064
0:37:23,7 --> 0:37:26,69
But I have a question.


1065
0:37:26,69 --> 0:37:30,82
Where's the room where
I drink my champagne?


1066
0:37:30,82 --> 0:37:32,33
Is it around here?


1067
0:37:32,33 --> 0:37:35,66
I didn't see the
champagne room.


1068
0:37:35,66 --> 0:37:37,55
I'd like to enjoy some
champagne as I


1069
0:37:37,55 --> 0:37:38,8
watch the world die.


1070
0:37:38,8 --> 0:37:41,36



1071
0:37:41,36 --> 0:37:44,47
TONI RAMOS: I could fashion
a champagne room for you.


1072
0:37:44,47 --> 0:37:46,81
I wasn't prepared for this.


1073
0:37:46,81 --> 0:37:48,74
ALLAN MCLEOD: Yes, you seem
more like a brainy science


1074
0:37:48,74 --> 0:37:53,75
geek who toys with missiles
and that sort of thing.


1075
0:37:53,75 --> 0:37:57,66
TONI RAMOS: Yes, I'm not
used to human contact.


1076
0:37:57,66 --> 0:38:1,322
I am just so thrilled
that you are around.


1077
0:38:1,322 --> 0:38:2,64
I could--


1078
0:38:2,64 --> 0:38:7,46
I have a bunch of Mountain Dew
or Red Bull I could mix


1079
0:38:7,46 --> 0:38:10,48
together for some sort
of champagne--


1080
0:38:10,48 --> 0:38:13,25
ALLAN MCLEOD: That's not the
ingredients for champagne.


1081
0:38:13,25 --> 0:38:14,79
That's not the ingredients.


1082
0:38:14,79 --> 0:38:15,22
TONI RAMOS: OK.


1083
0:38:15,22 --> 0:38:17,24
All right.


1084
0:38:17,24 --> 0:38:21,79
ALLAN MCLEOD: Really should hire
more wine connoisseurs or


1085
0:38:21,79 --> 0:38:24,64
something here at the factory,
at the missile factory.


1086
0:38:24,64 --> 0:38:28,1
Because I mean, who's funding
these sorts of operations?


1087
0:38:28,1 --> 0:38:34,97
People like me who wear furs and
expensive jewelry and like


1088
0:38:34,97 --> 0:38:37,5
to drink champagne
while people burn


1089
0:38:37,5 --> 0:38:39,18
up for no good reason.


1090
0:38:39,18 --> 0:38:40,61
TONI RAMOS: Oh, god.


1091
0:38:40,61 --> 0:38:41,93
Oh, gosh.


1092
0:38:41,93 --> 0:38:43,95
ALLAN MCLEOD: What are you
looking on the ground?


1093
0:38:43,95 --> 0:38:47,134
There's no rooms down there.


1094
0:38:47,134 --> 0:38:50,76
I want my champagne room.


1095
0:38:50,76 --> 0:38:53,5
JOE WENGERT: I'm afraid I have
some other bad news.


1096
0:38:53,5 --> 0:38:57,38
I just went to the area where
the lunch was set up.


1097
0:38:57,38 --> 0:38:59,81
And there are no caviar.


1098
0:38:59,81 --> 0:39:2,85
There are no king crab legs.


1099
0:39:2,85 --> 0:39:6,2
Can I please have the name of
your supervisor so that we can


1100
0:39:6,2 --> 0:39:10,14
complain to them now before
the world is destroyed?


1101
0:39:10,14 --> 0:39:12,68
Because we are very unhappy
with the job


1102
0:39:12,68 --> 0:39:14,9
that you've done here.


1103
0:39:14,9 --> 0:39:17,57
And you are going to perish
along with everyone else in


1104
0:39:17,57 --> 0:39:21,584
the world, but I want it to go
down on your record that you


1105
0:39:21,584 --> 0:39:25,1
are bad at what you do.


1106
0:39:25,1 --> 0:39:26,24
ALLAN MCLEOD: Very bad.


1107
0:39:26,24 --> 0:39:29,95
TONI RAMOS: I mean, we only
have mere minutes.


1108
0:39:29,95 --> 0:39:32,42
I have some jerky.


1109
0:39:32,42 --> 0:39:34,94
His name is Hank, if that's what
you're still looking for.


1110
0:39:34,94 --> 0:39:36,67
ALLAN MCLEOD: Jerky's
name is Hank.


1111
0:39:36,67 --> 0:39:38,71
TONI RAMOS: I have jerky.


1112
0:39:38,71 --> 0:39:40,76
My boss's name is Hank.


1113
0:39:40,76 --> 0:39:41,47
Please don't tell him.


1114
0:39:41,47 --> 0:39:43,205
I'm going to get fired.


1115
0:39:43,205 --> 0:39:46,21
JOE WENGERT: You thought we
wanted to snack on some jerky?


1116
0:39:46,21 --> 0:39:48,19
TONI RAMOS: It's all I have.


1117
0:39:48,19 --> 0:39:50,96
ALLAN MCLEOD: Benedict, what
kind of missile factory silo


1118
0:39:50,96 --> 0:39:52,56
is this place?


1119
0:39:52,56 --> 0:39:54,41
You're the one that found
them on the internet.


1120
0:39:54,41 --> 0:39:55,61
What--


1121
0:39:55,61 --> 0:39:59,32
JOE WENGERT: Their Yelp reviews
were off the charts.


1122
0:39:59,32 --> 0:40:0,73
TONI RAMOS: Thank you.


1123
0:40:0,73 --> 0:40:6,37
[APPLAUSE]


1124
0:40:6,37 --> 0:40:7,8
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Excuse me.


1125
0:40:7,8 --> 0:40:8,28
Officer?


1126
0:40:8,28 --> 0:40:9,8
I'd like to turn myself in.


1127
0:40:9,8 --> 0:40:10,62
JON GABRUS: Sure.


1128
0:40:10,62 --> 0:40:11,87
DREW DIFONZO MARKS:
I raped the earth.


1129
0:40:11,87 --> 0:40:15,37



1130
0:40:15,37 --> 0:40:18,12
JON GABRUS: I don't have
time for any of this.


1131
0:40:18,12 --> 0:40:18,92
I got to do--


1132
0:40:18,92 --> 0:40:20,31
I got to file--


1133
0:40:20,31 --> 0:40:22,8
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: I did it.


1134
0:40:22,8 --> 0:40:25,19
I've been doing it for years and
I just woke up today, and


1135
0:40:25,19 --> 0:40:28,156
I realized I'm not
driving a Prius.


1136
0:40:28,156 --> 0:40:31,37
I'm an earth rapist.


1137
0:40:31,37 --> 0:40:35,74
I've been following the earth
back to its car at night, and


1138
0:40:35,74 --> 0:40:38,33
getting into my gas guzzling
shit of a car


1139
0:40:38,33 --> 0:40:40,7
and raping this planet.


1140
0:40:40,7 --> 0:40:41,495
Take me away.


1141
0:40:41,495 --> 0:40:43,39
JON GABRUS: I'm going to just
take you way for the way you


1142
0:40:43,39 --> 0:40:46,82
just talked to a police
officer, for starters.


1143
0:40:46,82 --> 0:40:48,265
Raping the earth?


1144
0:40:48,265 --> 0:40:49,72
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Yeah.


1145
0:40:49,72 --> 0:40:52,78
JON GABRUS: Well, so what do you
call it, if unbeknownst to


1146
0:40:52,78 --> 0:40:56,36
the earth, you dig a little
hole, fuck it, and


1147
0:40:56,36 --> 0:40:58,81
then come in it?


1148
0:40:58,81 --> 0:40:59,435
DREW DIFONZO MARKS:
I don't, man.


1149
0:40:59,435 --> 0:41:2,635
Is that hole some fucking
asphalt that's eating away at


1150
0:41:2,635 --> 0:41:3,31
our nutrients?


1151
0:41:3,31 --> 0:41:3,82
Or is it a compost--


1152
0:41:3,82 --> 0:41:4,74
JON GABRUS: You don't
fuck asphalt.


1153
0:41:4,74 --> 0:41:7,876
You want mud or something
like that.


1154
0:41:7,876 --> 0:41:9,41
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Look,
man, you can rape the


1155
0:41:9,41 --> 0:41:10,57
planet how you want.


1156
0:41:10,57 --> 0:41:13,27
I'll rape the planet
how I want.


1157
0:41:13,27 --> 0:41:15,6
You can fuck it and
I can destroy it.


1158
0:41:15,6 --> 0:41:18,5
But my carbon footprint
is unforgivable.


1159
0:41:18,5 --> 0:41:20,5
I've been raping this
earth like it was a


1160
0:41:20,5 --> 0:41:22,54
fucking frat party.


1161
0:41:22,54 --> 0:41:23,35
Now, take me away.


1162
0:41:23,35 --> 0:41:25,102
I deserve it.


1163
0:41:25,102 --> 0:41:26,25
JON GABRUS: All right, man.


1164
0:41:26,25 --> 0:41:30,9
I'm going to take your prison,
where there's going to be gas


1165
0:41:30,9 --> 0:41:32,96
guzzling, or whatever
you refer to it.


1166
0:41:32,96 --> 0:41:33,69
ALLAN MCLEOD: All right.


1167
0:41:33,69 --> 0:41:38,58
Well, we ran the rape kit tests
on the earth like you


1168
0:41:38,58 --> 0:41:40,67
forced us to do.


1169
0:41:40,67 --> 0:41:42,85
DREW DIFONZO MARKS:
How bad is it?


1170
0:41:42,85 --> 0:41:44,2
ALLAN MCLEOD: I mean,
it's pretty normal--


1171
0:41:44,2 --> 0:41:48,36
there's some grass in it, some
bits of dirt and soil--


1172
0:41:48,36 --> 0:41:51,6
DREW DIFONZO MARKS:
I'm a monster.


1173
0:41:51,6 --> 0:41:53,34
ALLAN MCLEOD: There's no
evidence that you--


1174
0:41:53,34 --> 0:41:56,2
we can only arrest you if you
physically raped the earth.


1175
0:41:56,2 --> 0:41:57,5
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Now, did
you do a rape kit on the


1176
0:41:57,5 --> 0:42:0,43
general environment's area, on
this whole where that cop came


1177
0:42:0,43 --> 0:42:2,41
over and fucked it?


1178
0:42:2,41 --> 0:42:4,452
ALLAN MCLEOD: We did both--


1179
0:42:4,452 --> 0:42:6,71
JON GABRUS: [INAUDIBLE]


1180
0:42:6,71 --> 0:42:7,98
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Hey, you
rape the earth your way.


1181
0:42:7,98 --> 0:42:10,7
I'll rape it my way.


1182
0:42:10,7 --> 0:42:11,83
ALLAN MCLEOD: Hey,
don't worry.


1183
0:42:11,83 --> 0:42:14,16
The earth was asking for it.


1184
0:42:14,16 --> 0:42:14,84
He's OK.


1185
0:42:14,84 --> 0:42:15,65
He's [INAUDIBLE] me.


1186
0:42:15,65 --> 0:42:18,51
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: The earth
was asking for it?


1187
0:42:18,51 --> 0:42:19,6
Why?


1188
0:42:19,6 --> 0:42:21,52
Because of its shiny
blue oceans?


1189
0:42:21,52 --> 0:42:24,43
JON GABRUS: I mean, it's
covered in 70% water.


1190
0:42:24,43 --> 0:42:26,55
ALLAN MCLEOD: I mean, come on.


1191
0:42:26,55 --> 0:42:27,76
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: That's
water that we need.


1192
0:42:27,76 --> 0:42:29,57
ALLAN MCLEOD: It's so wet.


1193
0:42:29,57 --> 0:42:31,11
It's so wet.


1194
0:42:31,11 --> 0:42:32,98
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Oh, so
it's just asking for it?


1195
0:42:32,98 --> 0:42:33,69
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: All
right, officers,


1196
0:42:33,69 --> 0:42:35,366
officers, get in here.


1197
0:42:35,366 --> 0:42:35,772
MALE SPEAKER: All right.


1198
0:42:35,772 --> 0:42:36,18
ANDY DALY: What?


1199
0:42:36,18 --> 0:42:38,45
MALE SPEAKER: Here's this?


1200
0:42:38,45 --> 0:42:39,96
ANDY DALY: I'm busy being
a police officer.


1201
0:42:39,96 --> 0:42:40,51
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: We
need to have a


1202
0:42:40,51 --> 0:42:41,99
little sensitivity training.


1203
0:42:41,99 --> 0:42:43,97
It's come to my attention that
a number of you have been


1204
0:42:43,97 --> 0:42:46,72
making comments out when you're
interviewing suspects


1205
0:42:46,72 --> 0:42:50,15
about raping the earth, and how
the earth is asking for


1206
0:42:50,15 --> 0:42:52,69
it, and look at the way it's
dressed, and if it didn't want


1207
0:42:52,69 --> 0:42:55,39
to be raped it should have
stayed at Pangaea.


1208
0:42:55,39 --> 0:43:0,24
So from now on we just to look
at the earth as not an


1209
0:43:0,24 --> 0:43:1,74
acceptable thing to
talk about raping.


1210
0:43:1,74 --> 0:43:2,13
All right?


1211
0:43:2,13 --> 0:43:3,44
JON GABRUS: No matter--


1212
0:43:3,44 --> 0:43:4,8
OK.


1213
0:43:4,8 --> 0:43:4,64
Got it.


1214
0:43:4,64 --> 0:43:5,98
So like--


1215
0:43:5,98 --> 0:43:6,78
OK.


1216
0:43:6,78 --> 0:43:6,951
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: No.


1217
0:43:6,951 --> 0:43:7,47
Let's put anything out there.


1218
0:43:7,47 --> 0:43:8,53
I want to know where
your heads are at.


1219
0:43:8,53 --> 0:43:8,87
All right?


1220
0:43:8,87 --> 0:43:12,46
ALLAN MCLEOD: It spread apart
from Pangaea, like you said.


1221
0:43:12,46 --> 0:43:12,845
It spread out.


1222
0:43:12,845 --> 0:43:14,7
JON GABRUS: I mean, if I'm
busting a couple of guys who


1223
0:43:14,7 --> 0:43:17,81
are smoking a blunt in their
car, why can't I bring up that


1224
0:43:17,81 --> 0:43:20,0
I think raping the
earth is OK?


1225
0:43:20,0 --> 0:43:21,69
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: How would that
even come up just in the


1226
0:43:21,69 --> 0:43:23,41
process of arresting
them for that?


1227
0:43:23,41 --> 0:43:24,8
JON GABRUS: You know,
you see something.


1228
0:43:24,8 --> 0:43:25,84
You're like, oh that's
from the earth.


1229
0:43:25,84 --> 0:43:29,84
Speaking of earth, you ever
seen the way it rotates,


1230
0:43:29,84 --> 0:43:31,26
taking 24 hours?


1231
0:43:31,26 --> 0:43:33,26
Yeah, you're showing it
off, motherfucker.


1232
0:43:33,26 --> 0:43:34,8
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Kowalski,
you're having to do a lot of


1233
0:43:34,8 --> 0:43:36,45
work to bring rape
earth into that


1234
0:43:36,45 --> 0:43:37,925
conversation, I feel like.


1235
0:43:37,925 --> 0:43:41,66
ANDY DALY: Why is the earth
going out alone at night?


1236
0:43:41,66 --> 0:43:42,97
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Well,
technically, it's not going


1237
0:43:42,97 --> 0:43:45,17
out alone at night because it's
part of the solar system.


1238
0:43:45,17 --> 0:43:47,72
But even so, like would you say
that was OK for a woman?


1239
0:43:47,72 --> 0:43:50,13
Like would you say your mother
can't go out alone at night?


1240
0:43:50,13 --> 0:43:51,61
ANDY DALY: She cannot.


1241
0:43:51,61 --> 0:43:53,53
She's got a bad hip.


1242
0:43:53,53 --> 0:43:54,98
She needs help.


1243
0:43:54,98 --> 0:43:56,57
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Right, but
you would never say to a


1244
0:43:56,57 --> 0:43:59,8
citizen that it would be OK to
rape your mother because she


1245
0:43:59,8 --> 0:44:0,43
has a bad hip, or because
she's going


1246
0:44:0,43 --> 0:44:1,32
out at night, right?


1247
0:44:1,32 --> 0:44:2,875
ANDY DALY: Certainly not.


1248
0:44:2,875 --> 0:44:3,22
[WHISPERS]


1249
0:44:3,22 --> 0:44:4,286
Yes, I would.


1250
0:44:4,286 --> 0:44:6,96
JOE WENGERT: I think what he's
saying is, why can't the earth


1251
0:44:6,96 --> 0:44:9,87
sync up with some of the other
planets, in terms of having


1252
0:44:9,87 --> 0:44:13,84
their orbits happen at the same
time so they're not out


1253
0:44:13,84 --> 0:44:16,1
there in space on their own?


1254
0:44:16,1 --> 0:44:17,68
ANDY DALY: That is exactly
what I am saying.


1255
0:44:17,68 --> 0:44:20,83
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Are you
drawing a parallel between


1256
0:44:20,83 --> 0:44:22,86
earth's and other planets'
orbits and women's


1257
0:44:22,86 --> 0:44:24,69
menstruations?


1258
0:44:24,69 --> 0:44:25,33
JON GABRUS: What?


1259
0:44:25,33 --> 0:44:25,72
ANDY DALY: Whoa.


1260
0:44:25,72 --> 0:44:26,77
JON GABRUS: Whoa.


1261
0:44:26,77 --> 0:44:28,52
Slow it down, creepo.


1262
0:44:28,52 --> 0:44:29,78
No one was saying that.


1263
0:44:29,78 --> 0:44:31,73
JOE WENGERT: I'm saying that
they should hang out together.


1264
0:44:31,73 --> 0:44:34,75
I mean, earth and the other
planets don't have a problem


1265
0:44:34,75 --> 0:44:37,14
all going to the bathroom
together.


1266
0:44:37,14 --> 0:44:38,87
ANDY DALY: [LAUGHS]


1267
0:44:38,87 --> 0:44:40,16
JOE WENGERT: That didn't
make any sense.


1268
0:44:40,16 --> 0:44:40,645
No.


1269
0:44:40,645 --> 0:44:45,49
I realize now that
I think about it.


1270
0:44:45,49 --> 0:44:45,834
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: All right.


1271
0:44:45,834 --> 0:44:48,62
I don't you feel uncomfortable,
Lewalski, but I


1272
0:44:48,62 --> 0:44:51,22
want to get a female perspective
here, all right?


1273
0:44:51,22 --> 0:44:52,96
JON GABRUS: Well why don't
we ask Darren?


1274
0:44:52,96 --> 0:44:54,21
He's part earth.


1275
0:44:54,21 --> 0:44:56,73



1276
0:44:56,73 --> 0:44:58,85
What do women have
to do with this?


1277
0:44:58,85 --> 0:45:0,34
ALLAN MCLEOD: He's a
herm-earth-rodite.


1278
0:45:0,34 --> 0:45:1,91
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: What is he?


1279
0:45:1,91 --> 0:45:4,45
ALLAN MCLEOD: I always
mispronounce it.


1280
0:45:4,45 --> 0:45:4,6

Say it again.


1281
0:45:4,6 --> 0:45:5,69
ALLAN MCLEOD: Herm-earth-rodite.


1282
0:45:5,69 --> 0:45:6,27
DREW DIFONZO MARKS:
Herm-earth-rodite?


1283
0:45:6,27 --> 0:45:7,94
ALLAN MCLEOD: Herm-earth-rodite.


1284
0:45:7,94 --> 0:45:9,54
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: I'm
a herm-earth-rodite.


1285
0:45:9,54 --> 0:45:10,27
JON GABRUS: Yeah.


1286
0:45:10,27 --> 0:45:11,21

0:45:24,41 --> 0:45:25,96
I'm sorry to bother you.


1292
0:45:25,96 --> 0:45:29,3
But I'm supposed to be teaching

the room til 4:30.

are you saving?


1324

JON GABRUS: Venison and other
meats that I hunt myself.


1325
0:46:31,97 --> 0:46:34,95

room, square--


1326

anywhere at all.

I keep my laptop.

anywhere.

0:46:50,86 --> 0:46:52,7
You don't have to
keep them in--


1335
0:46:52,7 --> 0:46:53,2

where the outlet is


1336
0:46:53,2 --> 0:46:54,57
that I plug my laptop.


1337

professor in


1340

this world and teach.


1341
0:47:2,81 --> 0:47:3,49

1342
0:47:3,49 --> 0:47:7,51

real word-- the word


1343

confidence and swagger in

room that you could


1352
0:47:30,34 --> 0:47:31,56

0:47:34,5 --> 0:47:36,17
JON GABRUS: The Mind.


1356
0:47:36,17 --> 0:47:38,52
TONI RAMOS: You guys, I must
have overbooked the room.


1357
0:47:38,52 --> 0:47:41,62
So if we could just have
Professor Wengert come in,


1358
0:47:41,62 --> 0:47:45,27
just for this Wednesday, not a
big deal, and then you guys


1359
0:47:45,27 --> 0:47:46,19
can get back again.


1360
0:47:46,19 --> 0:47:48,16
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Yeah
you did overbook it.


1361
0:47:48,16 --> 0:47:49,92
Because Randy Quaid
signed up there.


1362
0:47:49,92 --> 0:47:52,7
And I want to talk about how
the Hollywood hit mafia is


1363
0:47:52,7 --> 0:47:54,95
trying to assassinate
us celebrities.


1364
0:47:54,95 --> 0:47:56,67
I've been in Canada the
last four years.


1365
0:47:56,67 --> 0:47:58,7
This is the first time I came
down, just to make this video.


1366
0:47:58,7 --> 0:48:1,39
TONI RAMOS: You guys can
go in the hallway.


1367
0:48:1,39 --> 0:48:2,6
I'll show you.


1368
0:48:2,6 --> 0:48:3,56
Let me unplug the--


1369
0:48:3,56 --> 0:48:4,7
[SCREAMING]


1370
0:48:4,7 --> 0:48:5,485
JON GABRUS: Oh, no!


1371
0:48:5,485 --> 0:48:6,82
I didn't even save my files.


1372
0:48:6,82 --> 0:48:7,37
TONI RAMOS: No.


1373
0:48:7,37 --> 0:48:8,46
No, trust me.


1374
0:48:8,46 --> 0:48:9,16
I got it.


1375
0:48:9,16 --> 0:48:10,57
It's not a big deal.


1376
0:48:10,57 --> 0:48:12,51
Here we go, closing it down.


1377
0:48:12,51 --> 0:48:14,9
JON GABRUS: But I'm not in
the mainframe anymore.


1378
0:48:14,9 --> 0:48:16,77
TONI RAMOS: No, it'll work.


1379
0:48:16,77 --> 0:48:17,52
Trust me.


1380
0:48:17,52 --> 0:48:18,83
JON GABRUS: Mainframe
is everywhere.


1381
0:48:18,83 --> 0:48:21,81



1382
0:48:21,81 --> 0:48:22,38
TONI RAMOS: All right.


1383
0:48:22,38 --> 0:48:22,96
All right.


1384
0:48:22,96 --> 0:48:25,11
JON GABRUS: That's my
mainframe thing.


1385
0:48:25,11 --> 0:48:26,22
TONI RAMOS: That's your
mainframe thing?


1386
0:48:26,22 --> 0:48:26,86
Great.


1387
0:48:26,86 --> 0:48:27,59
Awesome.


1388
0:48:27,59 --> 0:48:27,83
All right.


1389
0:48:27,83 --> 0:48:29,45
So, guys, if you want
to follow me.


1390
0:48:29,45 --> 0:48:30,98
Mr. Wengert, if you
want to get your


1391
0:48:30,98 --> 0:48:32,75
class prepped and ready.


1392
0:48:32,75 --> 0:48:32,966
JOE WENGERT: Great.


1393
0:48:32,966 --> 0:48:33,68
Thank you again.


1394
0:48:33,68 --> 0:48:34,54
TONI RAMOS: Absolutely.


1395
0:48:34,54 --> 0:48:35,8
JOE WENGERT: You need help
with some of that stuff?


1396
0:48:35,8 --> 0:48:38,169
JON GABRUS: If you're going to
carry the laptop, I think I


1397
0:48:38,169 --> 0:48:38,72
can get all the guns.


1398
0:48:38,72 --> 0:48:40,64
I'll be all right.


1399
0:48:40,64 --> 0:48:43,5
ALLAN MCLEOD: I got to
get all my weights.


1400
0:48:43,5 --> 0:48:45,71
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: And I left
all my "Christmas Vacation"


1401
0:48:45,71 --> 0:48:47,159
shit in here.


1402
0:48:47,159 --> 0:48:54,41
[APPLAUSE]


1403
0:48:54,41 --> 0:48:54,745
ANDY DALY: Hi.


1404
0:48:54,745 --> 0:48:55,93
How you doing?


1405
0:48:55,93 --> 0:48:57,16
I just want to let you know.


1406
0:48:57,16 --> 0:48:59,84
This produce over here,
this is all organic.


1407
0:48:59,84 --> 0:49:0,7
OK?


1408
0:49:0,7 --> 0:49:3,45
And then over here, it's just
full of chemicals that will


1409
0:49:3,45 --> 0:49:7,34
definitely shut your system
down like that.


1410
0:49:7,34 --> 0:49:11,2
I'm talking about immediate
organ failure.


1411
0:49:11,2 --> 0:49:11,69
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Wow.


1412
0:49:11,69 --> 0:49:14,32
You guys have really
changed the way


1413
0:49:14,32 --> 0:49:15,73
Trader Joe's is organized.


1414
0:49:15,73 --> 0:49:17,5
ANDY DALY: Yeah.


1415
0:49:17,5 --> 0:49:18,61
We just drew it-- you know,
everything used


1416
0:49:18,61 --> 0:49:19,54
to be mixed in together.


1417
0:49:19,54 --> 0:49:21,29
Now, we just got
it real clear.


1418
0:49:21,29 --> 0:49:24,93
Organic, you can eat
that and live.


1419
0:49:24,93 --> 0:49:25,94
Not organic--


1420
0:49:25,94 --> 0:49:30,74
immediate organ failure,
death upon ingestion.


1421
0:49:30,74 --> 0:49:34,57
And it's a little more expensive
for the organic.


1422
0:49:34,57 --> 0:49:35,62
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: How
much are we talking?


1423
0:49:35,62 --> 0:49:38,18
Because I'm on a budget.


1424
0:49:38,18 --> 0:49:41,4
ANDY DALY: Typically like
25-- oh, hang on.


1425
0:49:41,4 --> 0:49:42,3
DREW DIFONZO MARKS:
Oh, my god!


1426
0:49:42,3 --> 0:49:42,27
TONI RAMOS: [GAGGING]


1427
0:49:42,27 --> 0:49:43,69
ANDY DALY: Just want
to explain to you.


1428
0:49:43,69 --> 0:49:44,99
Over here is organic.


1429
0:49:44,99 --> 0:49:46,71
Oh.


1430
0:49:46,71 --> 0:49:48,74
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Am I allowed
to just freely sample


1431
0:49:48,74 --> 0:49:49,99
like she did?


1432
0:49:49,99 --> 0:49:52,25



1433
0:49:52,25 --> 0:49:54,61
ANDY DALY: No.


1434
0:49:54,61 --> 0:49:56,191
I mean--


1435
0:49:56,191 --> 0:49:56,93
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: All right.


1436
0:49:56,93 --> 0:49:57,5
What I--


1437
0:49:57,5 --> 0:50:0,61
ANDY DALY: Yeah, that was
not supposed to happen.


1438
0:50:0,61 --> 0:50:0,94
Normally--


1439
0:50:0,94 --> 0:50:1,45
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Great,
I'm going to have


1440
0:50:1,45 --> 0:50:2,7
to clean that up.


1441
0:50:2,7 --> 0:50:5,576



1442
0:50:5,576 --> 0:50:6,3
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: OK.


1443
0:50:6,3 --> 0:50:9,8
Well, based on this woman's
experience, I clearly see the


1444
0:50:9,8 --> 0:50:12,93
cons of eating what I'll just
call, the death food.


1445
0:50:12,93 --> 0:50:14,32
ANDY DALY: That's a
fair name for it.


1446
0:50:14,32 --> 0:50:14,76
Yeah.


1447
0:50:14,76 --> 0:50:15,68
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: But
you also said that


1448
0:50:15,68 --> 0:50:16,77
this is more expensive.


1449
0:50:16,77 --> 0:50:19,4
So I'm torn.


1450
0:50:19,4 --> 0:50:20,945
ANDY DALY: It is a little more
expensive, typically a markup


1451
0:50:20,945 --> 0:50:23,82
of like 25% or more.


1452
0:50:23,82 --> 0:50:26,82
That's got be a better way
to clean up a dead body.


1453
0:50:26,82 --> 0:50:27,3
It's really--


1454
0:50:27,3 --> 0:50:28,74
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: He's just
hitting that body with a mop.


1455
0:50:28,74 --> 0:50:29,548
ANDY DALY: He's just--


1456
0:50:29,548 --> 0:50:30,356
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Yep.


1457
0:50:30,356 --> 0:50:31,43
There it goes.


1458
0:50:31,43 --> 0:50:32,23
Yep.


1459
0:50:32,23 --> 0:50:32,96
ANDY DALY: --trying to
push her with a mop.


1460
0:50:32,96 --> 0:50:35,3
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: He's
got to push it more.


1461
0:50:35,3 --> 0:50:39,22
The body is moving
towards the mop.


1462
0:50:39,22 --> 0:50:39,57
ANDY DALY: Yeah.


1463
0:50:39,57 --> 0:50:41,3
JON GABRUS: Need help
with this, Tim?


1464
0:50:41,3 --> 0:50:41,91
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Yeah,
would you mind?


1465
0:50:41,91 --> 0:50:42,45
JON GABRUS: What
happened here?


1466
0:50:42,45 --> 0:50:44,99
She hit herself on the corner of
desk, something like that?


1467
0:50:44,99 --> 0:50:45,479
JOE WENGERT: All right.


1468
0:50:45,479 --> 0:50:48,413
That's the end of
our second set.


1469
0:50:48,413 --> 0:50:53,303
[APPLAUSE]


1470
0:50:53,303 --> 0:50:54,281
JOE WENGERT: How you
guys feeling?


1471
0:50:54,281 --> 0:50:56,726
You're still in it with us?


1472
0:50:56,726 --> 0:50:59,68
[APPLAUSE]


1473
0:50:59,68 --> 0:51:1,29
JOE WENGERT: We're going to
do one more set of improv.


1474
0:51:1,29 --> 0:51:3,72
So we're going to watch one more
YouTube video before we


1475
0:51:3,72 --> 0:51:7,7
get into it.


1476
0:51:7,7 --> 0:51:11,41
RYKER DUNCAN: Kelsey,
you manipulate me.


1477
0:51:11,41 --> 0:51:13,89
You manipulate my mind.


1478
0:51:13,89 --> 0:51:16,69
You manipulate my heart.


1479
0:51:16,69 --> 0:51:23,56
You tell me how you were the one
that helped me get through


1480
0:51:23,56 --> 0:51:32,15
my dad's death, you were there
for me, how I promised my dad


1481
0:51:32,15 --> 0:51:41,32
that he would meet the girl of
my future before he dies, and


1482
0:51:41,32 --> 0:51:42,57
that you were the one.


1483
0:51:42,57 --> 0:51:46,4



1484
0:51:46,4 --> 0:51:53,6
And then today, you have the
audacity to go to someone else


1485
0:51:53,6 --> 0:51:55,59
after telling me that you were
falling back in love with me.


1486
0:51:55,59 --> 0:51:58,22



1487
0:51:58,22 --> 0:52:1,17
That shit don't fly with me.


1488
0:52:1,17 --> 0:52:3,73
I may have been dating Jess.


1489
0:52:3,73 --> 0:52:7,46
I didn't love her and
you knew that.


1490
0:52:7,46 --> 0:52:10,65
Use your fucking mind.


1491
0:52:10,65 --> 0:52:13,92
Of course, you don't have one.


1492
0:52:13,92 --> 0:52:18,5
They're too fucked up with
drugs, and alcohol, and all


1493
0:52:18,5 --> 0:52:19,3
the other poisoning.


1494
0:52:19,3 --> 0:52:23,2



1495
0:52:23,2 --> 0:52:29,342
You go out with someone who
you said raped you.


1496
0:52:29,342 --> 0:52:31,5
You keep getting your
heart broke.


1497
0:52:31,5 --> 0:52:32,65
Yet you keep going back
to the same guy--


1498
0:52:32,65 --> 0:52:35,24



1499
0:52:35,24 --> 0:52:36,97
same guys over and
over and over.


1500
0:52:36,97 --> 0:52:39,83
At least I don't do that.


1501
0:52:39,83 --> 0:52:42,47
Fact is, you want to
manipulate my mind.


1502
0:52:42,47 --> 0:52:45,63
You want to manipulate
my heart.


1503
0:52:45,63 --> 0:52:47,67
You want try to break me down.


1504
0:52:47,67 --> 0:52:50,44
It's not going to happen.


1505
0:52:50,44 --> 0:52:53,5
I'm a lot smarter than that.


1506
0:52:53,5 --> 0:52:55,12
I'm a lot smarter than a lot of
people give me credit for.


1507
0:52:55,12 --> 0:52:59,395



1508
0:52:59,395 --> 0:53:4,615
But if you want to try and
destroy me, and go that low,


1509
0:53:4,615 --> 0:53:8,12
say, oh I love you, oh, I'm
back in love with you, and


1510
0:53:8,12 --> 0:53:13,93
you're not, and it's just
a lie, do me a favor.


1511
0:53:13,93 --> 0:53:20,19
You do those drugs, you do that
alcohol, you end up dead,


1512
0:53:20,19 --> 0:53:22,3
and you burn.


1513
0:53:22,3 --> 0:53:24,88
Burn in hell.


1514
0:53:24,88 --> 0:53:29,22



1515
0:53:29,22 --> 0:53:35,45
Rest in peace, bitch.


1516
0:53:35,45 --> 0:53:37,89
[APPLAUSE]


1517
0:53:37,89 --> 0:53:39,41
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: All right,
YouTube employees.


1518
0:53:39,41 --> 0:53:41,6
All right, YouTube employees.


1519
0:53:41,6 --> 0:53:42,44
ALLAN MCLEOD: What's going
on, I'm excited.


1520
0:53:42,44 --> 0:53:42,9
ANDY DALY: Comedy week!


1521
0:53:42,9 --> 0:53:43,36
Comedy week!


1522
0:53:43,36 --> 0:53:44,974
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: We are
doing Comedy Week.


1523
0:53:44,974 --> 0:53:45,938
ANDY DALY: Comedy Week!


1524
0:53:45,938 --> 0:53:47,87
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Here's
what we got to do.


1525
0:53:47,87 --> 0:53:50,22
We need some funny videos
to inspire some comics.


1526
0:53:50,22 --> 0:53:51,22
ANDY DALY: Fuck, yeah!


1527
0:53:51,22 --> 0:53:51,84
MIKE LEFFINGWELL:
Just brainstorm.


1528
0:53:51,84 --> 0:53:53,96
What's like the funniest topics
you guys can think of?


1529
0:53:53,96 --> 0:53:56,35
ANDY DALY: Oh, like the
death of your father.


1530
0:53:56,35 --> 0:53:56,53
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: OK.


1531
0:53:56,53 --> 0:53:57,65
All right, all right, all
right, all right.


1532
0:53:57,65 --> 0:53:57,81
All right.


1533
0:53:57,81 --> 0:53:59,55
That's a little heavy.


1534
0:53:59,55 --> 0:53:59,92
That's a little heavy for
the first one up.


1535
0:53:59,92 --> 0:54:0,52
But we're spit-balling.


1536
0:54:0,52 --> 0:54:1,73
No wrong answers, all right?


1537
0:54:1,73 --> 0:54:3,2
No wrong answers.


1538
0:54:3,2 --> 0:54:6,66
TONI RAMOS: A girl that keeps
going back to a guy that says


1539
0:54:6,66 --> 0:54:9,3
she's been raped by him.


1540
0:54:9,3 --> 0:54:11,65
ANDY DALY: I was hoping you
were going to say rape!


1541
0:54:11,65 --> 0:54:12,35
TONI RAMOS: Yes!


1542
0:54:12,35 --> 0:54:12,52
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: OK.


1543
0:54:12,52 --> 0:54:13,49
TONI RAMOS: It's Comedy Week!


1544
0:54:13,49 --> 0:54:13,975
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: It is.


1545
0:54:13,975 --> 0:54:14,8
OK.


1546
0:54:14,8 --> 0:54:16,58
But also, just think
like generic, like


1547
0:54:16,58 --> 0:54:18,25
broadly fun, silly--


1548
0:54:18,25 --> 0:54:20,64
ANDY DALY: Like somebody who's
so mentally ill that it's


1549
0:54:20,64 --> 0:54:21,558
depressing.


1550
0:54:21,558 --> 0:54:22,56
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: OK, yeah.


1551
0:54:22,56 --> 0:54:24,65
You can objectively maybe
laugh at that.


1552
0:54:24,65 --> 0:54:26,18
JOE WENGERT: I have one that
I think is pretty funny.


1553
0:54:26,18 --> 0:54:30,25
It's a cat, and you don't
realize this when


1554
0:54:30,25 --> 0:54:31,45
you first watch it.


1555
0:54:31,45 --> 0:54:35,1
But the owner's holding its paws
out so it looks like it's


1556
0:54:35,1 --> 0:54:36,56
playing a keyboard.


1557
0:54:36,56 --> 0:54:40,36
And then you find out that cat
raped a bunch of other cats.


1558
0:54:40,36 --> 0:54:44,615
JON GABRUS: I was not on board
at first, and then something


1559
0:54:44,615 --> 0:54:45,87
piqued my interest
in the middle.


1560
0:54:45,87 --> 0:54:48,1
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: I had the
exact opposite experience.


1561
0:54:48,1 --> 0:54:50,39
I was on board at first, that
sounded like a typical, fun


1562
0:54:50,39 --> 0:54:51,82
YouTube kind of thing.


1563
0:54:51,82 --> 0:54:52,98
And then--


1564
0:54:52,98 --> 0:54:54,79
I don't even know how we get
that information across there.


1565
0:54:54,79 --> 0:54:55,47
The cat raped--


1566
0:54:55,47 --> 0:54:57,82
JOE WENGERT: It's my cat.


1567
0:54:57,82 --> 0:55:0,59
And it has a problem with
raping other cats.


1568
0:55:0,59 --> 0:55:1,99
I cannot get it to stop.


1569
0:55:1,99 --> 0:55:3,53
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: All right,
Drew, you had--


1570
0:55:3,53 --> 0:55:3,87
DREW DIFONZO MARKS:
What about this?


1571
0:55:3,87 --> 0:55:7,27
What if it's like a montage of a
bunch of different videos of


1572
0:55:7,27 --> 0:55:10,29
people getting kicked
in the nuts?


1573
0:55:10,29 --> 0:55:11,475
And every time they get kicked
in the nuts it plays like a


1574
0:55:11,475 --> 0:55:13,53
weird wacky sound effect,
like boing?


1575
0:55:13,53 --> 0:55:16,94
And then we actually pan out and
reveal that this is going


1576
0:55:16,94 --> 0:55:20,93
on inside the mind of a man
who is giving his suicidal


1577
0:55:20,93 --> 0:55:24,48
video into a video blog before
he puts a gun in his mouth.


1578
0:55:24,48 --> 0:55:27,6
Cries and says, this
is for you, Daddy.


1579
0:55:27,6 --> 0:55:29,14
And blows his brains out.


1580
0:55:29,14 --> 0:55:31,49
ANDY DALY: I like that.


1581
0:55:31,49 --> 0:55:33,65
JON GABRUS: I feel like we could
lose all the nut kicks,


1582
0:55:33,65 --> 0:55:36,314
and just get to the funny
stuff right off the bat.


1583
0:55:36,314 --> 0:55:37,718
ANDY DALY: Can we just
say this for sure?


1584
0:55:37,718 --> 0:55:41,62
Let's not show any, any videos
where it doesn't feel like at


1585
0:55:41,62 --> 0:55:43,48
the end, that person
either killed


1586
0:55:43,48 --> 0:55:44,73
someone else or himself.


1587
0:55:44,73 --> 0:55:47,34



1588
0:55:47,34 --> 0:55:48,568
MIKE LEFFINGWELL:
I mean, I guess.


1589
0:55:48,568 --> 0:55:50,8
I got to be-- so far, I'm
closest on board with that


1590
0:55:50,8 --> 0:55:53,1
last one, but really
in protest.


1591
0:55:53,1 --> 0:55:55,72
ANDY DALY: And preferably, we
could see the murder weapon in


1592
0:55:55,72 --> 0:55:57,26
the shot, if possible--


1593
0:55:57,26 --> 0:56:1,3
six or seven of them, swords,
or guns, or what have you.


1594
0:56:1,3 --> 0:56:2,84
JON GABRUS: What about that
channel we have on our site


1595
0:56:2,84 --> 0:56:6,6
that is all like diatribes that
people are giving right


1596
0:56:6,6 --> 0:56:9,3
before they set their cult
leader's house on fire?


1597
0:56:9,3 --> 0:56:11,31
You know the one, where the
people are just talking


1598
0:56:11,31 --> 0:56:13,34
directly to the camera
as the FBI is coming


1599
0:56:13,34 --> 0:56:14,66
in and killing them?


1600
0:56:14,66 --> 0:56:15,82
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Yeah,
I did not sign off on


1601
0:56:15,82 --> 0:56:17,13
that channel, guys.


1602
0:56:17,13 --> 0:56:18,645
JON GABRUS: It's Comedy
Week, chief.


1603
0:56:18,645 --> 0:56:19,5
It's comedy.


1604
0:56:19,5 --> 0:56:21,0
ANDY DALY: Comedy Week.


1605
0:56:21,0 --> 0:56:21,105
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Wait.


1606
0:56:21,105 --> 0:56:21,31
I'm sorry.


1607
0:56:21,31 --> 0:56:23,2
So is it going to be like--
that's an example of


1608
0:56:23,2 --> 0:56:24,9
the video we do?


1609
0:56:24,9 --> 0:56:24,37
JON GABRUS: Let's use
those videos.


1610
0:56:24,37 --> 0:56:25,37
I think those videos
are the best.


1611
0:56:25,37 --> 0:56:26,31
They're two camera.


1612
0:56:26,31 --> 0:56:28,74
And they're people about
to be murdered, like


1613
0:56:28,74 --> 0:56:30,14
police-assisted suicide.


1614
0:56:30,14 --> 0:56:33,22
TONI RAMOS: It's like a quick
eight-minute thing and you get


1615
0:56:33,22 --> 0:56:34,17
to--there's lots of fun stuff.


1616
0:56:34,17 --> 0:56:35,38
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Let me give
you guys an example.


1617
0:56:35,38 --> 0:56:37,75
Maybe somebody wearing something
kind of interesting,


1618
0:56:37,75 --> 0:56:40,48
or like a conversation starter,
doing a voice, or an


1619
0:56:40,48 --> 0:56:41,9
impression or something?


1620
0:56:41,9 --> 0:56:43,65
ANDY DALY: Like a mustache
they're too depressed to grow


1621
0:56:43,65 --> 0:56:45,676
out all the way.


1622
0:56:45,676 --> 0:56:46,9
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: OK.


1623
0:56:46,9 --> 0:56:46,89
Yeah, yeah.


1624
0:56:46,89 --> 0:56:47,16
All right.


1625
0:56:47,16 --> 0:56:47,69
That's fine.


1626
0:56:47,69 --> 0:56:48,94
That's in the ballpark.


1627
0:56:48,94 --> 0:56:51,41



1628
0:56:51,41 --> 0:56:52,86
ANDY DALY: I think we know
what we're doing.


1629
0:56:52,86 --> 0:56:55,752



1630
0:56:55,752 --> 0:57:1,6
[APPLAUSE]


1631
0:57:1,6 --> 0:57:2,64
JON GABRUS: If you're nervous
at all about giving the


1632
0:57:2,64 --> 0:57:4,97
eulogy, I think you'll
be fine.


1633
0:57:4,97 --> 0:57:6,84
Just, if you can--


1634
0:57:6,84 --> 0:57:9,86
the last one was super intense
when Mom died.


1635
0:57:9,86 --> 0:57:10,94
So OK?


1636
0:57:10,94 --> 0:57:15,9
Just keep it low key, light,
maybe one anecdote, one joke.


1637
0:57:15,9 --> 0:57:16,6
And I'll be up here
to support you.


1638
0:57:16,6 --> 0:57:17,6
TONI RAMOS: Thank you.


1639
0:57:17,6 --> 0:57:18,5
Thank you so much.


1640
0:57:18,5 --> 0:57:21,93
JON GABRUS: And just remember,
not too much.


1641
0:57:21,93 --> 0:57:27,47



1642
0:57:27,47 --> 0:57:31,77
TONI RAMOS: Thank you all for
coming to my cunt of a


1643
0:57:31,77 --> 0:57:34,33
mother's funeral.


1644
0:57:34,33 --> 0:57:38,15
She was a real woman.


1645
0:57:38,15 --> 0:57:42,96
I loved her so much because
that fat, fucking bitch


1646
0:57:42,96 --> 0:57:44,43
wouldn't do anything.


1647
0:57:44,43 --> 0:57:47,52
And that's when I learned
to be a real woman.


1648
0:57:47,52 --> 0:57:47,7
JON GABRUS: Toni!


1649
0:57:47,7 --> 0:57:48,15
Toni.


1650
0:57:48,15 --> 0:57:49,65
TONI RAMOS: What's up?


1651
0:57:49,65 --> 0:57:53,68
It went all black and then
I just started going.


1652
0:57:53,68 --> 0:57:55,26
JON GABRUS: The services will
continue in a moment.


1653
0:57:55,26 --> 0:57:56,92
This always happens
at funerals.


1654
0:57:56,92 --> 0:57:58,61
You went a little dark.


1655
0:57:58,61 --> 0:58:0,58
You used the C-word


1656
0:58:0,58 --> 0:58:1,46
TONI RAMOS: Cunt?


1657
0:58:1,46 --> 0:58:3,64
JON GABRUS: That's the C-word
I was referring to.


1658
0:58:3,64 --> 0:58:4,3
TONI RAMOS: I didn't know
if it was cancer.


1659
0:58:4,3 --> 0:58:6,42
JON GABRUS: Yeah.


1660
0:58:6,42 --> 0:58:6,75
ALLAN MCLEOD: Boo.


1661
0:58:6,75 --> 0:58:10,36
Let's do the eulogy some more.


1662
0:58:10,36 --> 0:58:10,696
Boo.


1663
0:58:10,696 --> 0:58:11,69
JON GABRUS: Sir, could
you take the Solo


1664
0:58:11,69 --> 0:58:12,35
cup off your mouth?


1665
0:58:12,35 --> 0:58:13,6
We couldn't hear you.


1666
0:58:13,6 --> 0:58:17,7



1667
0:58:17,7 --> 0:58:18,45
ALLAN MCLEOD: Boo.


1668
0:58:18,45 --> 0:58:20,32
JON GABRUS: I think he wants
more of the eulogy.


1669
0:58:20,32 --> 0:58:21,83
Just light, light.


1670
0:58:21,83 --> 0:58:25,28
ALLAN MCLEOD: Tell
a funny story.


1671
0:58:25,28 --> 0:58:26,52
JON GABRUS: Thank you, sir.


1672
0:58:26,52 --> 0:58:28,23
TONI RAMOS: Uncle Jimmy--


1673
0:58:28,23 --> 0:58:31,39
a funny story.


1674
0:58:31,39 --> 0:58:36,39
When I was five, I started
ballet and have


1675
0:58:36,39 --> 0:58:37,76
continued on since.


1676
0:58:37,76 --> 0:58:42,13
And the first day of ballet
class, I remember, I got out


1677
0:58:42,13 --> 0:58:42,78
of the car.


1678
0:58:42,78 --> 0:58:45,49
I was so excited.


1679
0:58:45,49 --> 0:58:49,5
My mom grabbed my face.


1680
0:58:49,5 --> 0:58:52,7
And she took her cigarette
with her shaky hand.


1681
0:58:52,7 --> 0:58:54,9
And she burned my cheek.


1682
0:58:54,9 --> 0:58:58,28
And she said, you
fucking dance.


1683
0:58:58,28 --> 0:59:0,86
Dance, little baby, dance.


1684
0:59:0,86 --> 0:59:3,72
Mama's gonna go get drunk.


1685
0:59:3,72 --> 0:59:6,975
Mama's gonna get drunk and--


1686
0:59:6,975 --> 0:59:7,905
JON GABRUS: All right.


1687
0:59:7,905 --> 0:59:8,215
All right!


1688
0:59:8,215 --> 0:59:8,37
Toni!


1689
0:59:8,37 --> 0:59:10,41
Toni, I let you hang
out there.


1690
0:59:10,41 --> 0:59:12,185
I thought that story was
going to take a--


1691
0:59:12,185 --> 0:59:13,31
TONI RAMOS: It got so black.


1692
0:59:13,31 --> 0:59:17,57
And then I got dizzy and then
I didn't know what happened.


1693
0:59:17,57 --> 0:59:19,8
JON GABRUS: Well, what happened
was you told the


1694
0:59:19,8 --> 0:59:21,92
dance, you baby, dance story.


1695
0:59:21,92 --> 0:59:22,85
TONI RAMOS: Oh, my mom.


1696
0:59:22,85 --> 0:59:23,73
JON GABRUS: I know,
she was so--


1697
0:59:23,73 --> 0:59:26,92
TONI RAMOS: That was my first
burn she gave me.


1698
0:59:26,92 --> 0:59:29,9
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Boo,
we want more eulogy.


1699
0:59:29,9 --> 0:59:32,13
Not clearly videos stolen
from Comedy Week.


1700
0:59:32,13 --> 0:59:35,826



1701
0:59:35,826 --> 0:59:37,778
JOE WENGERT: Hey, Tina?


1702
0:59:37,778 --> 0:59:39,32
Can I ask you a question?


1703
0:59:39,32 --> 0:59:40,63
DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Sure.


1704
0:59:40,63 --> 0:59:44,37
JOE WENGERT: I heard that you,
uh, you passed around a


1705
0:59:44,37 --> 0:59:47,3
birthday card for Jerry's
birthday.


1706
0:59:47,3 --> 0:59:51,6
But you didn't come by and
ask me to sign it.


1707
0:59:51,6 --> 0:59:55,12
And I just wanted to let
you know that shit


1708
0:59:55,12 --> 0:59:56,64
don't fly with me.


1709
0:59:56,64 --> 1:0:1,41



1710
1:0:1,41 --> 1:0:5,53
If we are going to celebrate
someone's birthday in this


1711
1:0:5,53 --> 1:0:9,11
office, I better to be an
integral part of that


1712
1:0:9,11 --> 1:0:10,55
celebration.


1713
1:0:10,55 --> 1:0:13,55
Because if I find out
about it, that shit


1714
1:0:13,55 --> 1:0:16,31
don't fly with me.


1715
1:0:16,31 --> 1:0:18,37
DREW DIFONZO MARKS:
Tuck, two things--


1716
1:0:18,37 --> 1:0:20,98
number one, I am so sorry.


1717
1:0:20,98 --> 1:0:24,72
And number two, you are doing
great for your first week as


1718
1:0:24,72 --> 1:0:25,97
an intern here.


1719
1:0:25,97 --> 1:0:29,43



1720
1:0:29,43 --> 1:0:32,1
JOE WENGERT: I know I've
only been here a week.


1721
1:0:32,1 --> 1:0:35,39
But Jerry and I have shared
a couple of fun moments.


1722
1:0:35,39 --> 1:0:38,77
And I would have very easily
been able to reference one of


1723
1:0:38,77 --> 1:0:43,59
those moments into a message
on his birthday card that


1724
1:0:43,59 --> 1:0:45,54
would have made his
birthday brighter.


1725
1:0:45,54 --> 1:0:47,14
But then what do I find?


1726
1:0:47,14 --> 1:0:51,47
I got a fucking knife stuck
in my back by you, Tina.


1727
1:0:51,47 --> 1:0:52,4
ALLAN MCLEOD: Hey, man.


1728
1:0:52,4 --> 1:0:52,44
I'm sorry.


1729
1:0:52,44 --> 1:0:56,56
I forgot to give you the paper
clips back earlier.


1730
1:0:56,56 --> 1:0:57,435
I borrowed them.


1731
1:0:57,435 --> 1:0:58,61
I used a lot of them.


1732
1:0:58,61 --> 1:1:3,9
But I meant to give them back
to you sooner than now.


1733
1:1:3,9 --> 1:1:6,12
But anyway, sorry
about that, man.


1734
1:1:6,12 --> 1:1:8,7
Been a real busy day.


1735
1:1:8,7 --> 1:1:10,15
JOE WENGERT: You used a bunch
of my paper clips?


1736
1:1:10,15 --> 1:1:11,325
ALLAN MCLEOD: Yeah, but--


1737
1:1:11,325 --> 1:1:12,17
JOE WENGERT: I'm confused.


1738
1:1:12,17 --> 1:1:13,89
I though you were just going to
borrow them, and you said


1739
1:1:13,89 --> 1:1:15,78
you'd be right back with them.


1740
1:1:15,78 --> 1:1:16,48
ALLAN MCLEOD: Yeah, yeah.


1741
1:1:16,48 --> 1:1:20,33
Well, when they've all been
processed I'll-- if it's an


1742
1:1:20,33 --> 1:1:23,54
important to you I'll try to
gather those paper clips back


1743
1:1:23,54 --> 1:1:25,47
and return them to you.


1744
1:1:25,47 --> 1:1:34,3
JOE WENGERT: It's just that my
whole thing is you're going to


1745
1:1:34,3 --> 1:1:40,55
come over here, and take my
supplies and tell me that one


1746
1:1:40,55 --> 1:1:42,71
thing's going to happen
with them.


1747
1:1:42,71 --> 1:1:46,45
And then I come to find out that
a completely different


1748
1:1:46,45 --> 1:1:48,39
thing has happened with them.


1749
1:1:48,39 --> 1:1:50,87
And also, you're giving
me a timetable.


1750
1:1:50,87 --> 1:1:53,19
And then you might as well just
not even bother to do


1751
1:1:53,19 --> 1:1:57,46
that because it doesn't
mean a fucking thing.


1752
1:1:57,46 --> 1:2:1,105
That shit don't fly
with me, OK?


1753
1:2:1,105 --> 1:2:3,33
ANDY DALY: Hey, you
know, it Friday.


1754
1:2:3,33 --> 1:2:4,39
I think we're all just
going to knock


1755
1:2:4,39 --> 1:2:5,63
off around 3:00 today.


1756
1:2:5,63 --> 1:2:8,64
I know we talked about staying
until 4:30 or 5:00.


1757
1:2:8,64 --> 1:2:9,61
We're all going to
leave at 3:00.


1758
1:2:9,61 --> 1:2:11,95
Cool?


1759
1:2:11,95 --> 1:2:15,5
JOE WENGERT: I might need to
sit down for this one.


1760
1:2:15,5 --> 1:2:16,17
ANDY DALY: What's up?


1761
1:2:16,17 --> 1:2:17,49
No, we're all just going
to head out at 3:00.


1762
1:2:17,49 --> 1:2:18,69
Just going to take off
a little early.


1763
1:2:18,69 --> 1:2:19,9
JON GABRUS: Here's your chair.


1764
1:2:19,9 --> 1:2:20,3
Here's your chair.


1765
1:2:20,3 --> 1:2:21,46
JOE WENGERT: Thank you.


1766
1:2:21,46 --> 1:2:24,14
JON GABRUS: You're
welcome, please.


1767
1:2:24,14 --> 1:2:25,58
ANDY DALY: Just because Monday's
a holiday, figured


1768
1:2:25,58 --> 1:2:27,62
give everybody a jump on the--


1769
1:2:27,62 --> 1:2:32,13
JOE WENGERT: When I got up
this morning, I said, I'm


1770
1:2:32,13 --> 1:2:33,3
going to go in.


1771
1:2:33,3 --> 1:2:36,27
Get into the office around 9
o'clock like I normally do.


1772
1:2:36,27 --> 1:2:37,28
ANDY DALY: Yeah,
that was great.


1773
1:2:37,28 --> 1:2:37,96
We saw you at 9:00.


1774
1:2:37,96 --> 1:2:38,52
Great.


1775
1:2:38,52 --> 1:2:41,21
JOE WENGERT: And I was like,
maybe I'll hang out with my


1776
1:2:41,21 --> 1:2:42,0
buddies tonight.


1777
1:2:42,0 --> 1:2:44,12
Maybe I'll go out and hang
out with the gang.


1778
1:2:44,12 --> 1:2:44,96
ANDY DALY: That sounds great.


1779
1:2:44,96 --> 1:2:46,37
JOE WENGERT: And I said you know
what, I'll just send them


1780
1:2:46,37 --> 1:2:46,96
all an email.


1781
1:2:46,96 --> 1:2:48,37
Maybe we'll meet up later.


1782
1:2:48,37 --> 1:2:49,9
What time am I going to
put in the email?


1783
1:2:49,9 --> 1:2:52,79
Well, clearly I'll put
around 5 o'clock.


1784
1:2:52,79 --> 1:2:56,4
Because I know that the work
day here ends around 5


1785
1:2:56,4 --> 1:2:59,66
o'clock, at the earliest,
4:30.


1786
1:2:59,66 --> 1:3:5,88
And if for some godforsaken
reason, the powers that be


1787
1:3:5,88 --> 1:3:7,97
decide that we're going
to just shirk our


1788
1:3:7,97 --> 1:3:13,13
responsibilities and fuck off
at 3 o'clock, I, as an


1789
1:3:13,13 --> 1:3:16,75
employee, will be made aware
of such a decision.


1790
1:3:16,75 --> 1:3:18,72
But that hasn't happened.


1791
1:3:18,72 --> 1:3:22,21
So I know that the day ahead
of me is going to be smooth


1792
1:3:22,21 --> 1:3:27,62
sailing with what I normally
expect, working from 9 o'clock


1793
1:3:27,62 --> 1:3:30,3
til 5:00 PM.


1794
1:3:30,3 --> 1:3:32,22
ANDY DALY: You can
stay til 5:00.


1795
1:3:32,22 --> 1:3:32,743
JOE WENGERT: Oh, OK.


1796
1:3:32,743 --> 1:3:33,993
No problem.


1797

MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Here
we are in hell.


1800
1:3:43,85 --> 1:3:46,49
It's every bit as horrible
as I would have imagined.


1801
1:3:46,49 --> 1:3:48,97
What did you do to get here?


1802
1:3:48,97 --> 1:3:53,395
ALLAN MCLEOD: I had some
of that alcohol.


1803
1:3:53,395 --> 1:3:55,62
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Yeah?


1804
1:3:55,62 --> 1:3:55,8
ALLAN MCLEOD: Yeah.


1805
1:3:55,8 --> 1:3:56,55
I had some of that alcohol.


1806
1:3:56,55 --> 1:3:58,84
JON GABRUS: Welcome
to hell, boys.


1807
1:3:58,84 --> 1:4:0,13
MIKE LEFFINGWELL:
Are you, uh--


1808
1:4:0,13 --> 1:4:2,88
JON GABRUS: Yeah, I'm one of the
devil's sidekicks, if you


1809
1:4:2,88 --> 1:4:4,56
can call me that.


1810
1:4:4,56 --> 1:4:7,566
I funnel his diarrhea
every day.


1811
1:4:7,566 --> 1:4:9,13
It's part of the hell gig.


1812
1:4:9,13 --> 1:4:11,23
Look, ah--


1813
1:4:11,23 --> 1:4:12,73
ALLAN MCLEOD: Out
of-- out of him?


1814
1:4:12,73 --> 1:4:14,0
Or into him?


1815
1:4:14,0 --> 1:4:16,4
JON GABRUS: Yeah, out of
him into my mouth.


1816
1:4:16,4 --> 1:4:17,74
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Really?


1817
1:4:17,74 --> 1:4:18,93
JON GABRUS: Like, beer funnel.


1818
1:4:18,93 --> 1:4:21,14
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Because I
would think a sidekick would


1819
1:4:21,14 --> 1:4:23,4
be like a position of like,
you're a step above the people


1820
1:4:23,4 --> 1:4:26,83
that are prisoners here.


1821
1:4:26,83 --> 1:4:29,3
JON GABRUS: And of course as you
know, it's part of hell.


1822
1:4:29,3 --> 1:4:30,12
You should probably know this.


1823
1:4:30,12 --> 1:4:32,63
But "Toonami" is cancelled.


1824
1:4:32,63 --> 1:4:33,88
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Come on.


1825
1:4:33,88 --> 1:4:35,7



1826
1:4:35,7 --> 1:4:37,765
ALLAN MCLEOD: This
really is hell!


1827
1:4:37,765 --> 1:4:38,66
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: What
are they going


1828
1:4:38,66 --> 1:4:41,452
to show in its place?


1829
1:4:41,452 --> 1:4:43,3
JON GABRUS: There's a couple
of different programs they


1830
1:4:43,3 --> 1:4:46,33
might be airing.


1831
1:4:46,33 --> 1:4:48,92
There might be the John
Wayne Crazy hour.


1832
1:4:48,92 --> 1:4:50,25
It's a pun on Gacey.


1833
1:4:50,25 --> 1:4:51,61
Give me a second.


1834
1:4:51,61 --> 1:4:53,21
I'm trying to think of some.


1835
1:4:53,21 --> 1:4:54,94
ALLAN MCLEOD: You shouldn't have
to think of--I mean, they


1836
1:4:54,94 --> 1:4:56,36
already exist.


1837
1:4:56,36 --> 1:4:56,95
JON GABRUS: Yeah, yeah.


1838
1:4:56,95 --> 1:4:59,82
They all-- but you know, also,
I've had a steady diet of the


1839
1:4:59,82 --> 1:5:3,71
devil's diarrhea for the last
infinity amount of years.


1840
1:5:3,71 --> 1:5:7,17
So if you can cut me a
little slack here.


1841
1:5:7,17 --> 1:5:12,33
There is the, it's the Child
Abuse Power Hour, or like that


1842
1:5:12,33 --> 1:5:13,59
Power Child Abuse Hour.


1843
1:5:13,59 --> 1:5:15,4
I don't remember the exact--


1844
1:5:15,4 --> 1:5:15,69
ALLAN MCLEOD: Well, I
like those names.


1845
1:5:15,69 --> 1:5:17,4
JON GABRUS: But more
importantly, the worst part


1846
1:5:17,4 --> 1:5:19,185
about hell is that "Toonami"
has been canceled.


1847
1:5:19,185 --> 1:5:21,69



1848
1:5:21,69 --> 1:5:25,0
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Look, I'm not
100% sure I belong here.


1849
1:5:25,0 --> 1:5:27,7
The only thing that I ever did
in my life was I broke up with


1850
1:5:27,7 --> 1:5:28,32
my boyfriend.


1851
1:5:28,32 --> 1:5:31,16



1852
1:5:31,16 --> 1:5:32,4
And I'm going through
everything.


1853
1:5:32,4 --> 1:5:33,19
He was really upset.


1854
1:5:33,19 --> 1:5:34,58
Like, he was really,
really mad.


1855
1:5:34,58 --> 1:5:35,705
JON GABRUS: Why did you
break up with him?


1856
1:5:35,705 --> 1:5:36,15
Was it because--


1857
1:5:36,15 --> 1:5:37,935
MIKE LEFFINGWELL:
He was crazy.


1858
1:5:37,935 --> 1:5:39,173
He was like a crazy guy.


1859
1:5:39,173 --> 1:5:40,1
He was really weird.


1860
1:5:40,1 --> 1:5:42,12
He was totally different from
the point that I met him until


1861
1:5:42,12 --> 1:5:43,96
the point when I decided
to break up with him.


1862
1:5:43,96 --> 1:5:45,69
JON GABRUS: You broke up with
him because he raped you, and


1863
1:5:45,69 --> 1:5:47,22
that was like a known thing
around the school?


1864
1:5:47,22 --> 1:5:51,36



1865
1:5:51,36 --> 1:5:53,31
ALLAN MCLEOD: We're dealing
with like hell-type stuff


1866
1:5:53,31 --> 1:5:55,41
here, so we're assuming it was
a pretty severe breakup.


1867
1:5:55,41 --> 1:5:56,122
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Yeah, sorry.


1868
1:5:56,122 --> 1:5:56,48
Wait, wait.


1869
1:5:56,48 --> 1:5:58,89
If he raped me, then I
would go to hell for


1870
1:5:58,89 --> 1:5:59,41
breaking up with him?


1871
1:5:59,41 --> 1:6:0,7
JON GABRUS: Well, I'm
not saying that.


1872
1:6:0,7 --> 1:6:4,16
ALLAN MCLEOD: You might have
been asking for it.


1873
1:6:4,16 --> 1:6:5,43
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: I'm
not a planet.


1874
1:6:5,43 --> 1:6:7,36
ALLAN MCLEOD: That's
too far in hell?


1875
1:6:7,36 --> 1:6:8,52
JON GABRUS: In hell, that's
a little touchy.


1876
1:6:8,52 --> 1:6:9,86
ALLAN MCLEOD: That's
crossing the line?


1877
1:6:9,86 --> 1:6:11,56
MIKE LEFFINGWELL: No, just,
nothing happened specifically.


1878
1:6:11,56 --> 1:6:12,577
I just broke up with him.


1879
1:6:12,577 --> 1:6:13,8
Because I was like,
I don't want to be


1880
1:6:13,8 --> 1:6:13,89
involved with this guy.


1881
1:6:13,89 --> 1:6:15,52
He's just weird.

came over here.

to McDonald's.
