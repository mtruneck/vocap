###4 SHANE SMITH: Where are going now?
###6 MR. KIM: We are going to military demarcation line.
###9 
###38 SHANE SMITH: Your political indoctrination continues when
###41 the North Koreans take you to their side of the DMZ.
###45 And going to the DMZ from the north is a completely
###48 different animal than going to the DMZ from the south.
###51 From the south, you have to go through checkpoint,
###53 checkpoint, checkpoint, checkpoint.
###55 On the North Korean side, you go from Pyongyang.
###57 It's about a 2 and 1/2 hour drive.
###58 But when you go there, actually, it's a
###60 lot more laid back.
###61 Although you do notice, on the drive in, there's a hell of a
###64 lot more troops on the North Korean side.
###66 And everywhere there's these massive monuments.
###68 And you're like, what are those monuments?
###70 And they say, oh, they're filled with dynamite.
###73 And if there's ever an invasion, they blow up, and
###75 they fall down.
###76 And they are tank barriers.
###77 
###89 And unlike the South Korean side, you can
###91 shoot what you want.
###92 You can point at people.
###93 you can give them the finger.
###93 You can do whatever you want.
###94 You can drink beer.
###96 [LAUGHTER]
###98 SHANE SMITH: So basically, it's a big
###99 "fuck you" to the South.
###100 It's a big "fuck you" to the Americans.
###101 
###114 We're in Panmunjeom, in the demilitarized zone, where the
###119 armistice was signed between the DPRK and the UN.
###125 
###134 SHANE SMITH: All they want to do is tell you about how bad
###137 the Americans are, this is where we defeated the American
###140 imperialist aggressors, this is where North Korea shut down
###144 the biggest military power in the world.
###146 And that's what everything is designed to do.
###148 
###156 We're on night vision because there's no electricity in
###159 Panmunjeom.
###160 
###164 We got in trouble for shooting.
###165 They said we might get charged for a criminal offense.
###168 So I'm trying to do this as quietly as possible.
###173 
###185 All you hear at the DMZ is talk of reunification.
###188 
###194 SHANE SMITH: Is this is a political thing?
###196 Like are you trying to reunify?
###198 They won't mention--
###199 just reunify, reunify.
###200 You think one day they will be unified?
###201 
###214 SHANE SMITH: At that point you go--
###215 these guys are serious, serious dudes.
###218 
###232 And then, on the way back, you stop off and you have a meal.
###234 And they're like, oh, you're hungry?
###236 Hey, let's just stop at this-- any old restaurant.
###238 And they're pretending, like, this is like any restaurant.
###241 We just showed up.
###242 Hey, McDonald's on the side of the road.
###244 But let's say there's seven of you.
###245 You get to the restaurant.
###246 There's seven places laid out, and the whole of the
###248 restaurant is empty.
###249 It's been choreographed.
###250 They've been waiting for you for two days, all set up-- the
###252 whole restaurant waiting to go.
###254 We're in Kaesong, in a nice restaurant.
###257 We just had a lovely meal.
###259 You have lunch, which is like 50 plates of little shit.
###262 Again, you can't eat any of it.
###264 But it's like-- just look how much food we have.
###266 We're so great.
###268 Kinda quiet.
###269 Kinda quiet.
###272 [SIGH]
###273 [INAUDIBLE].
###275 So your first two days there you're
###278 like, crazy food, politics.
###281 Crazy food, politics.
###282 So you start to get a bit freaked out at this point.
###285 Thank you.
###286 FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes.
###287 SHANE SMITH: [LAUGH]
###288 Bye-bye.
###289 FEMALE SPEAKER: Bye.
###291 And then on the way back, you know, thinking, this is the
###293 fourth largest army in the world, all along this border.
###297 And they've threatened America with nukes--
###299 and Japan with nukes.
###300 I'm like, how can they have nukes?
###302 They don't have electricity.
###303 It's like turn-of-the-century industrial Britain.
###306 How do they have nukes?
###307 
###353 SHANE SMITH: So, after driving back from the DMZ and our
###356 choreographed lunch, you realize that everything is
###359 going to be choreographed.
###360 Like, hey, what do you want to do tonight?
###362 Want to go for a few beers?
###363 And you're like, hey, this isn't so bad.
###365 Sure, let's go out for a few beers.
###366 And you go out to the sort of state-sanctioned karaoke
###370 place, which is only, really, for foreigners and really
###373 high-ranking party officials.
###374 [SINGING IN KOREAN]
###421 [APPLAUSE]
###423 SHANE SMITH: Now the guards have been waiting.
###425 They've studied their whole life, you know, English, and
###428 they've studied political dialectics.
###430 So that they're the best and the brightest.
###432 And this is like the top position.
###433 But they have to wait all year for about 10 days for any
###436 tourists to come.
###437 So there's kind of this weird-- like they're holding
###440 back their excitement because they get to eat, and they get
###442 to drink, and smoke cigarettes, and all these
###444 great things.
###445 And you can see them vibrating--
###446 they're so excited.
###447 You know, yeah, have some cigarettes.
###448 And they're like, "oh god," and drinking, but they are
###451 trying not to show it.
###452 Check one, two.
###454 MR LEE: [LAUGH]
###455 Check two, one two, one two.
###457 SHANE SMITH: This is for you.
###458 [SINGING IN ENGLISH]
###479 She doesn't like my song.
###481 [APPLAUSE]
###485 [INAUDIBLE]
###490 SHANE SMITH: To the museum?
###491 MALE SPEAKER 1: Museum.
###492 SHANE SMITH: Museum, yeah.
###493 
###496 SHANE SMITH: The International Friendship Exhibition Hall.
###499 And we're going to buy some ties.
###502 
###505 SHANE SMITH: Bad for you?
###507 It's bad for everybody.
###509 MR LEE: [LAUGH]
###510 
###512 SHANE SMITH: [SINGING IN KOREAN]
###518 What does it mean?
###519 Hello?
###520 FEMALE SPEAKER 1: I'm glad to meet you.
###521 SHANE SMITH: I'm glad to meet you.
###524 That's why you shake hands.
###525 
###530 SHANE SMITH: But that's why, when you sing it, you always
###532 shake hands.
###533 MR LEE: Yeah.
###533 Tomorrow we have a big day.
###535 FEMALE SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###537 SHANE SMITH: Goodnight.
###538 
###542 SHANE SMITH: Oh, OK.
###543 MR LEE: This morning.
###544 FEMALE SPEAKER 1: This morning.
###545 [LAUGH]
###545 SHANE SMITH: I see you this morning.
###547 So we went out on a night on the town in Pyongyang with our
###552 guards, which is good, because the guards weren't enjoying us
###555 as human beings.
###557 Today they threatened Jamie, who's filming this, with--
###559 what was it?
###560 Gross, insensitive crimes to the republic, or something?
###564 JAMIE: Criminal offenses.
###565 SHANE SMITH: Criminal offenses.
###565 JAMIE: --which would have severe repercussions.
###569 SHANE SMITH: All we had to do was buy like six bottles of
###570 blueberry wine, and everybody was fine, except for Mr. Lee.
###574 He wanted to fight with us after we disrespected
###577 [KOREAN], the song that says, "pleased to meet you."
###582 So we're drinking soju.
###586 And we're going to bed now.
###589 He got mad at me.
###590 Mr. Lee got mad at me.
###591 He goes, it was the first song I taught you!
###594 OK--
###595 [LAUGH]
###596 I don't remember the first song you taught me, Mr. Lee.
###599 OK, honeybun.
###601 Goodnight.
###602 [APPLAUSE]
###603 
###637 SHANE SMITH: So once they get through with the
###639 indoctrination--
###640 like, the Pueblo and DMZ-- of how bad the Americans are,
###644 then begins--
###645 how great we are.
###646 And that starts with Kim
###647 Il-Sung, the Eternal President.
###649 And everybody has to go and pay their respects to the
###652 great statue of Kim Il-Sung, who, although he's been dead
###655 since 1994, is still the president of North Korea.
###658 
###683 I'm going to lay a wreath at the the
###684 statute of Kim Il-Sung.
###687 We have to do this as a token of respect.
###690 
###700 And then they took us two hours south of Pyongyang to
###704 the International Friendship Exhibition, which is this
###708 2000-room sort of fortress cut into a mountain--
###713 deep into a mountain, like 20 stories down.
###716 And what it is, is it's all these presents that were given
###720 or sent to Kim Il-Sung by heads of state or foreign
###723 dignitaries or notaries.
###725 They are so paranoid about anyone finding out about these
###727 treasures that they won't let you know where this is.
###730 They won't tell you anything.
###731 And of course, you can't shoot there.
###733 And in fact, they got really mad even when we
###735 were shooting outside.
###737 He took my camera, and he said, how much memory does
###739 your camera have?
###740 And I'm like, oh, I don't know, 48 megs or something.
###745 And he opened it up.
###745 And he took it out.
###746 And I had a 5 gig card because I was shooting actual movies
###749 with it on the sly.
###750 And he goes, you're a liar.
###752 You lied to me.
###753 You know very well that's not true.
###754 This is five gigs.
###755 And even if I had taken pictures down there, which I
###758 didn't, they just take out your memory card and say,
###760 thank you very much.
###761 So we're hiding from our guards right now, who don't
###763 want us to film anything.
###765 We have to keep quiet.
###768 We're allowed to be quiet up here.
###770 They're relaxing and having tea right now, so we've got a
###772 few seconds.
###773 We're at the International Friendship Museum, or
###777 otherwise known as the international insanity museum,
###780 where all the presents from all around the world came.
###783 And it's like alligators holding trays and all kinds of
###786 dead animals.
###787 And ivory, like huge ivory, and all this gold stuff.
###790 They have all this crazy business.
###792 And there's so many attractions there, so many
###795 treasures, that, if you were to stop and look at each one,
###798 it would take a year and a half to get through.
###800 Everybody goes on this pilgrimage at one time in
###802 their lives.
###803 And they wear their best clothes.
###805 The women get dressed up in native costume.
###807 The men wear their uniforms.
###808 And what a benevolent god because he's sharing all these
###812 amazing treasures, like he would share
###814 them with his children.
###815 So they think that every leader in the world thinks
###818 that Kim Il-Sung is the best.
###820 Not that we're mad at them, or North Korea's on it's own.
###823 They think Kim Il-Sung is the best.
###824 They don't understand that the world is mad at North Korea.
###828 
###905 SHANE SMITH: Going to the subway, for us, was a really
###907 big deal because we never got to
###909 interact with North Koreans.
###910 And we were like, wow, we get to see
###912 real, live North Koreans.
###912 We're going down into the metro.
###915 We're going down deep.
###916 This is amazing because it's a working subway, bomb shelter,
###920 and beautiful thing.
###924 They either try to ignore you, or they're incredibly
###928 fascinated by you.
###930 And a lot of them look at you, and they do not like you
###932 because they've been told you're the devil since they
###934 were two years old.
###936 
###946 Subways are a big thing in communist countries.
###947 I mean, Moscow is famous for its lavish stops on its public
###952 transportation system, as is Pyongyang--
###954 you know, look at how great our public
###956 transport system is.
###957 
###976 So you get to go from one stop to another stop, both of which
###980 are incredibly lavish and over the top.
###983 SHANE SMITH: Fireworks, fireworks.
###984 Ah.
###985 The rest aren't as lavish.
###986 And apparently, the rest are just tiny little, five feet
###989 tall things that you come out of that are really functional.
###992 But they have two, sort of, monumental ones that you're
###995 allowed to see.
###995 You're not allowed to see the other ones.
###997 
###1023 And as you come out, you realize this is 1950s Russia.
###1028 This is Soviet Russia.
###1029 This is Maoist China.
###1031 I've come back in a time warp.
###1032
