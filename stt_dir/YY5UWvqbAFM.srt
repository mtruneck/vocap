0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:6,461



2
0:0:6,461 --> 0:0:8,612
MALE SPEAKER: That's
Carroll's tent.


3
0:0:8,612 --> 0:0:10,25
It fell over.


4
0:0:10,25 --> 0:0:15,35



5
0:0:15,35 --> 0:0:16,838
It's like a turtle.


6
0:0:16,838 --> 0:0:19,814
A turtle falls on its back,
can't get back up.


7
0:0:19,814 --> 0:0:23,286
What happened to your tent?


8
0:0:23,286 --> 0:0:25,27
MIKE CARROLL: Unnnh.


9
0:0:25,27 --> 0:0:26,28
MALE SPEAKER: Where are you?


10
0:0:26,28 --> 0:0:27,7
MIKE CARROLL: I'm here.


11
0:0:27,7 --> 0:0:29,5
MALE SPEAKER: Nice tech.


12
0:0:29,5 --> 0:0:30,4
I like that tech.


13
0:0:30,4 --> 0:0:31,91
MIKE CARROLL: What tech?


14
0:0:31,91 --> 0:0:33,741
MALE SPEAKER: The technique,
look at this.


15
0:0:33,741 --> 0:0:36,229
MALE SPEAKER: Coffin,
coffin style.


16
0:0:36,229 --> 0:0:38,201
MIKE CARROLL: Help
me out here.


17
0:0:38,201 --> 0:0:38,7
MALE SPEAKER: Need help?


18
0:0:38,7 --> 0:0:39,92
MALE SPEAKER: You know
you gotta do it.


19
0:0:39,92 --> 0:0:41,204
MALE SPEAKER: You gotta
try to get out.


20
0:0:41,204 --> 0:0:42,92
MALE SPEAKER: You got yourself
into this mess, Mike, you got


21
0:0:42,92 --> 0:0:45,2
to get yourself out of it.


22
0:0:45,2 --> 0:0:46,69
MALE SPEAKER: You're saying when
we make this thing, we


23
0:0:46,69 --> 0:0:47,89
should go lay it on your
party footage?


24
0:0:47,89 --> 0:0:49,6
MIKE CARROLL: Because I didn't
want it to be all about that,


25
0:0:49,6 --> 0:0:52,5
but I just don't remember
what it was.


26
0:0:52,5 --> 0:0:54,18
And because I know you had the
camera on at all times, so I


27
0:0:54,18 --> 0:0:56,13
didn't know what kind
of footage you had.


28
0:0:56,13 --> 0:0:59,43
When I said that, I think it
was just at the peak of all


29
0:0:59,43 --> 0:1:1,17
the stuff coming out.


30
0:1:1,17 --> 0:1:1,755
And I was just like, great.


31
0:1:1,755 --> 0:1:3,227
I'm just that guy.


32
0:1:3,227 --> 0:1:4,975
MALE SPEAKER: Right.


33
0:1:4,975 --> 0:1:5,85
MALE SPEAKER: Lean this way.


34
0:1:5,85 --> 0:1:6,91
MALE SPEAKER: Lean what way?


35
0:1:6,91 --> 0:1:8,16
MALE SPEAKER: Backwards.


36
0:1:8,16 --> 0:1:14,31



37
0:1:14,31 --> 0:1:15,99
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, he said
he didn't want this up.


38
0:1:15,99 --> 0:1:18,25
Said it'd be like too
much drunk footage.


39
0:1:18,25 --> 0:1:21,19
ALEX OLSEN: Fuck that.


40
0:1:21,19 --> 0:1:25,67
He was the most drunk guy on
the trip-- on the trip.


41
0:1:25,67 --> 0:1:30,9
Yeah, he was fucking
nuts on that trip.


42
0:1:30,9 --> 0:1:31,66
I'd never seen him like that.


43
0:1:31,66 --> 0:1:33,13
MALE SPEAKER: What's up, Greg?


44
0:1:33,13 --> 0:1:33,99
GREG: Morning.


45
0:1:33,99 --> 0:1:35,492
MALE SPEAKER: Is
this your crib?


46
0:1:35,492 --> 0:1:37,36
GREG: This is it.


47
0:1:37,36 --> 0:1:39,59
MALE SPEAKER: So last night,
I guess this is it, huh?


48
0:1:39,59 --> 0:1:41,51
GREG: This is the last
night, isn't it?


49
0:1:41,51 --> 0:1:42,79
MALE SPEAKER: Camping.


50
0:1:42,79 --> 0:1:43,78
GREG: Oh man.


51
0:1:43,78 --> 0:1:44,96
That's a bummer.


52
0:1:44,96 --> 0:1:47,87
SAM SMYTH : Everyone got
along just perfect.


53
0:1:47,87 --> 0:1:50,7
I don't think it could
have been any better.


54
0:1:50,7 --> 0:1:50,88
You know?


55
0:1:50,88 --> 0:1:53,1
By the end, we were
just one team.


56
0:1:53,1 --> 0:1:56,6
In that camping environment,
it's so communal.


57
0:1:56,6 --> 0:1:57,71
You can't be a prick.


58
0:1:57,71 --> 0:1:58,71
And you can't be--


59
0:1:58,71 --> 0:1:59,36
you know?


60
0:1:59,36 --> 0:2:1,8
You can't be a pussy either.


61
0:2:1,8 --> 0:2:4,37
Like, there's no, like,
sitting this out.


62
0:2:4,37 --> 0:2:7,2
It's like, everybody did
everything together.


63
0:2:7,2 --> 0:2:12,37
[SINGING]


64
0:2:12,37 --> 0:2:15,64
MALE SPEAKER: With your
triflin' ass.


65
0:2:15,64 --> 0:2:18,4
Why don't you go fuck some of
your funky-ass friends?


66
0:2:18,4 --> 0:2:22,66
Shit, hell, you're probably
doing that shit anyway.


67
0:2:22,66 --> 0:2:24,901
MALE SPEAKER: As you may have
guessed, we are waiting for


68
0:2:24,901 --> 0:2:27,77
the Girl team and the
Anti-Hero team.


69
0:2:27,77 --> 0:2:30,26
Rumor has it they got lost on
their way out here because


70
0:2:30,26 --> 0:2:34,6
they had to stop at the hotel
and pick up their skateboards.


71
0:2:34,6 --> 0:2:35,24
So they will be here.


72
0:2:35,24 --> 0:2:36,83
And everybody wants to
know how long the


73
0:2:36,83 --> 0:2:37,62
demo's going to be.


74
0:2:37,62 --> 0:2:39,845
Well, I said it will
be forever.


75
0:2:39,845 --> 0:2:41,465
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]
is on his way for


76
0:2:41,465 --> 0:2:44,4
those concerned folks.


77
0:2:44,4 --> 0:2:45,5
They're on their way.


78
0:2:45,5 --> 0:2:48,25
In the meantime, we're going to
give way free [INAUDIBLE]


79
0:2:48,25 --> 0:2:50,74
T-shirts for switch
manual tricks.


80
0:2:50,74 --> 0:2:51,99
So let me see something
switch.


81
0:2:51,99 --> 0:2:59,145



82
0:2:59,145 --> 0:3:9,97
[CHEERING]


83
0:3:9,97 --> 0:3:12,175
MALE SPEAKER: Hey Mike,
what took so long?


84
0:3:12,175 --> 0:3:12,5
MIKE CARROLL: Huh?


85
0:3:12,5 --> 0:3:13,685
MALE SPEAKER: What
took so long?


86
0:3:13,685 --> 0:3:14,675
MIKE CARROLL: I don't know.


87
0:3:14,675 --> 0:3:16,83
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, you
fuckin' got lost.


88
0:3:16,83 --> 0:3:18,46
MIKE CARROLL: Yeah,
we got lost.


89
0:3:18,46 --> 0:3:20,45
MALE SPEAKER: Oh,
nothing cool.


90
0:3:20,45 --> 0:3:22,3
MIKE CARROLL: Did we
miss anything?


91
0:3:22,3 --> 0:3:23,93
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I already
killed the demo.


92
0:3:23,93 --> 0:3:24,89
MALE SPEAKER: I kind of want you
to come here and just warm


93
0:3:24,89 --> 0:3:26,96
up the crowd a little bit.


94
0:3:26,96 --> 0:3:27,73
Get them stoked.


95
0:3:27,73 --> 0:3:30,74
And then we going to come
in and just clean up.


96
0:3:30,74 --> 0:3:34,5
SAM SMYTH : A lot of the little
kids, they didn't even


97
0:3:34,5 --> 0:3:36,42
understand what was happening
in front of them.


98
0:3:36,42 --> 0:3:38,79
But to the guys our age and a
little bit younger, there were


99
0:3:38,79 --> 0:3:41,8
some younger kids that got it.


100
0:3:41,8 --> 0:3:43,63
But lots of kids definitely came
up, and it was like, this


101
0:3:43,63 --> 0:3:45,61
is the coolest thing
I've ever seen.


102
0:3:45,61 --> 0:3:49,56
It was cool to touch those
people like that.


103
0:3:49,56 --> 0:3:49,73
MALE SPEAKER: Get
this on camera.


104
0:3:49,73 --> 0:3:52,12
I'm going to make this
shit right here.


105
0:3:52,12 --> 0:3:52,38
MALE SPEAKER: In the window?


106
0:3:52,38 --> 0:3:55,224
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
$5 on the line.


107
0:3:55,224 --> 0:4:0,89



108
0:4:0,89 --> 0:4:1,34
MALE SPEAKER: And who
would you say is

0:4:1,34 --> 0:4:2,86
the MVP of the tour?


110
0:4:2,86 --> 0:4:3,88
MALE SPEAKER: Of the tour?


111
0:4:3,88 --> 0:4:6,28
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


112
0:4:6,28 --> 0:4:7,914
MALE SPEAKER: Giving

113
0:4:7,914 --> 0:4:8,86

0:4:8,86 --> 0:4:10,11
Allah.


115

0:4:15,4 --> 0:4:16,98
MALE SPEAKER: Malto For sure.


118
0:4:16,98 --> 0:4:18,31
That kid's killing it.


119
0:4:18,31 --> 0:4:19,93
Spin wizard.


120
0:4:19,93 --> 0:4:20,74

MALE SPEAKER: Crankers.


125
0:4:30,8 --> 0:4:32,15

0:4:32,15 --> 0:4:32,74
That's it.


127
0:4:32,74 --> 0:4:33,565
That's all I'm saying.


128
0:4:33,565 --> 0:4:34,75
Fuck that, fuck that dude.


129
0:4:34,75 --> 0:4:37,84

0:4:40,77 --> 0:4:43,62



134
0:4:43,62 --> 0:4:45,785

Because he did everything.


135
0:4:45,785 --> 0:4:48,55

0:4:48,55 --> 0:4:49,7
What'd you think?


137
0:4:49,7 --> 0:4:50,7
MALE SPEAKER: Carroll.


138
0:4:50,7 --> 0:4:53,52
Oh, well different,
different genre.


139
0:4:53,52 --> 0:4:55,71
But yeah, Carroll did it
too, for part of it.


140
0:4:55,71 --> 0:5:3,75



141
0:5:3,75 --> 0:5:6,78
MALE SPEAKER: Are we talking
nighttime or daytime?


142
0:5:6,78 --> 0:5:8,15
MALE SPEAKER: That's
up to you.


143
0:5:8,15 --> 0:5:10,535

0:5:11,785 --> 0:5:14,83



146
0:5:14,83 --> 0:5:16,1

0:5:26,67 --> 0:5:28,35
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


155
0:5:28,35 --> 0:5:30,79

0:5:30,79 --> 0:5:34,154
MALE SPEAKER: Oh yeah,

157
0:5:34,154 --> 0:5:37,81

0:5:37,81 --> 0:5:38,54
MALE SPEAKER: Here you go.


159
0:5:38,54 --> 0:5:38,61
One more.


160
0:5:38,61 --> 0:5:38,9
[? Hold ?]


161
0:5:38,9 --> 0:5:40,15
[? on. ?]


162
0:5:40,15 --> 0:5:47,472



163
0:5:47,472 --> 0:5:54,37
[CHEERING]


164
0:5:54,37 --> 0:5:55,562
MALE SPEAKER: And I know what
you mean about it being one


165
0:5:55,562 --> 0:5:57,55
team because by the end, it
was like hard to even


166
0:5:57,55 --> 0:6:0,27
differentiate like who--


167
0:6:0,27 --> 0:6:1,84
I mean, you didn't even
think about in terms


168
0:6:1,84 --> 0:6:2,23
of like that anymore.


169
0:6:2,23 --> 0:6:2,77
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


170
0:6:2,77 --> 0:6:5,68
MALE SPEAKER: It just seemed
like, seamless like--


171
0:6:5,68 --> 0:6:7,7
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


172
0:6:7,7 --> 0:6:9,22
MALE SPEAKER: Like it-- like it
almost seemed like Carroll


173
0:6:9,22 --> 0:6:10,93
was like, Anti-Hero or
something like--


174
0:6:10,93 --> 0:6:11,61
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


175
0:6:11,61 --> 0:6:15,23
Like Brian with Anti-Hero
boards.


176
0:6:15,23 --> 0:6:19,21
Those guys had Girl stickers
all over their shit.


177
0:6:19,21 --> 0:6:46,18



178
0:6:46,18 --> 0:6:48,146
MALE SPEAKER: Captain Booya.


179
0:6:48,146 --> 0:6:49,396
One more time.


180
0:6:49,396 --> 0:6:57,418



181
0:6:57,418 --> 0:6:58,882
MALE SPEAKER: This is great.


182
0:6:58,882 --> 0:7:0,834
I'm just looking for the kid
with the most fucked-up board,


183
0:7:0,834 --> 0:7:1,82
and I think found it.


184
0:7:1,82 --> 0:7:4,9
See that real board with
the purple shirt?


185
0:7:4,9 --> 0:7:5,47
MALE SPEAKER: What are the
things you look for?


186
0:7:5,47 --> 0:7:7,34
MALE SPEAKER: I looked at their
shoes and then like how


187
0:7:7,34 --> 0:7:9,18
much they skate.


188
0:7:9,18 --> 0:7:9,8
MALE SPEAKER: There's
two out here now.


189
0:7:9,8 --> 0:7:11,345
MALE SPEAKER: Taking the kid
with the Anti-Hero shirt and


190
0:7:11,345 --> 0:7:13,29
the board sauce.


191
0:7:13,29 --> 0:7:17,78
He's got a little more style,
like he's going to go further.


192
0:7:17,78 --> 0:7:18,3
MALE SPEAKER: All right,
homie's leaving.


193
0:7:18,3 --> 0:7:19,515
I think, just hand
it to him, huh?


194
0:7:19,515 --> 0:7:30,3



195
0:7:30,3 --> 0:7:30,81
MALE SPEAKER: Shoes
are fucked-up.


196
0:7:30,81 --> 0:7:32,31
Your board's all fucked-up.


197
0:7:32,31 --> 0:7:34,86



198
0:7:34,86 --> 0:7:36,88
Truck's a little loose but--


199
0:7:36,88 --> 0:7:37,36
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks
a lot, man.


200
0:7:37,36 --> 0:7:38,32
MALE SPEAKER: That's
your board so--


201
0:7:38,32 --> 0:7:39,28
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks a lot.


202
0:7:39,28 --> 0:7:40,53
MALE SPEAKER: Have a
good summer, dude.


203
0:7:40,53 --> 0:7:46,48



204
0:7:46,48 --> 0:7:48,3
BRIAN ANDERSON: I don't want
to jinx it, but I'm really


205
0:7:48,3 --> 0:7:50,62
already hopefully looking
forward to next year.


206
0:7:50,62 --> 0:7:52,58
Because everybody
just vibes, like


207
0:7:52,58 --> 0:7:54,12
everybody gets along fine.


208
0:7:54,12 --> 0:7:57,87
And everybody's down at camp
and get some brats and some


209
0:7:57,87 --> 0:8:0,31
stakes and light the fire up.


210
0:8:0,31 --> 0:8:3,614
Wake up and do it
all over again.


211
0:8:3,614 --> 0:8:4,53
It's fun.


212
0:8:4,53 --> 0:8:7,4
And everybody looks up
to everybody else.


213
0:8:7,4 --> 0:8:10,24
And everybody gets each
other psyched.


214
0:8:10,24 --> 0:8:11,98
And we all enjoy each
other's skating.


215
0:8:11,98 --> 0:8:14,945
So it's just feels totally
natural, man.


216
0:8:14,945 --> 0:8:18,68



217
0:8:18,68 --> 0:8:21,6
MALE SPEAKER: You guys
want a falafel?


218
0:8:21,6 --> 0:8:22,19
MALE SPEAKER: Falafel?


219
0:8:22,19 --> 0:8:24,972
MALE SPEAKER: It's been all
day since we got here.


220
0:8:24,972 --> 0:8:26,222
There are two brand new ones.


221
0:8:26,222 --> 0:8:35,659



222
0:8:35,659 --> 0:8:38,7
SAM SMYTH : So we're on the ride
home, and we're heading


223
0:8:38,7 --> 0:8:38,769
back to SF.


224
0:8:38,769 --> 0:8:42,44
And Mike's in the van,
Brian's in the van,


225
0:8:42,44 --> 0:8:46,75
Peabody, Andrew, Mo.


226
0:8:46,75 --> 0:8:51,13
And we're going back through one
of those little towns in


227
0:8:51,13 --> 0:8:54,37
Oregon, and we just stop
off the freeway.


228
0:8:54,37 --> 0:8:56,87
And we happen on a strip club,
and we just go in there, just


229
0:8:56,87 --> 0:8:58,32
for, whatever, quick beer.


230
0:8:58,32 --> 0:8:59,57
And we're going to
get on the road.


231
0:8:59,57 --> 0:9:1,87



232
0:9:1,87 --> 0:9:4,7
Mo and Mike sit next to
each other, and I'm


233
0:9:4,7 --> 0:9:4,5
sitting next to them.


234
0:9:4,5 --> 0:9:9,12
And the stripper comes up
and sits next to Mo.


235
0:9:9,12 --> 0:9:11,66
And it was, like, Mo looks at
her , and he goes, who's your


236
0:9:11,66 --> 0:9:13,58
favorite skater, just for no
reason, right out the gate.


237
0:9:13,58 --> 0:9:15,91
And she goes--


238
0:9:15,91 --> 0:9:18,91
didn't even blink-- she was
like, Mike Carroll.


239
0:9:18,91 --> 0:9:20,57
And Mo's just like,
are you serious?


240
0:9:20,57 --> 0:9:24,2
Just leans back and he's
right there, like.


241
0:9:24,2 --> 0:9:25,19
Her mind was blown.


242
0:9:25,19 --> 0:9:26,994
She was like, oh my God, oh my
God, oh my God, oh my God,


243
0:9:26,994 --> 0:9:28,35
it's Mike Carroll.


244
0:9:28,35 --> 0:9:30,72
Like, immediately grabs him,
takes him in the back.


245
0:9:30,72 --> 0:9:32,23
Starts giving him
free lap dances.


246
0:9:32,23 --> 0:9:35,73
She was like, so beat, huge
rotted out front tooth, speed


247
0:9:35,73 --> 0:9:37,22
head stripper.


248
0:9:37,22 --> 0:9:40,52
So funny but didn't even--


249
0:9:40,52 --> 0:9:41,506
didn't take her a second.


250
0:9:41,506 --> 0:9:43,63
She knew who her favorite skater
was, Mike Carroll.


251
0:9:43,63 --> 0:11:43,63
