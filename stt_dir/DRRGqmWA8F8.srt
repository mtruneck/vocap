1
0:0:2,44 --> 0:0:3,92
October this year.


2
0:0:3,92 --> 0:0:5,52
Around the world, devoted fans


3
0:0:5,52 --> 0:0:8,2
mourned the death of Steve Jobs,


4
0:0:8,2 --> 0:0:11,44
the force of nature behind Apple.


5
0:0:11,44 --> 0:0:16,32
He distorted reality. It's a mixture
of charisma, chutzpah,


6
0:0:16,32 --> 0:0:19,0
bullshit, self-belief, self-delusion,


7
0:0:19,0 --> 0:0:24,96
and insane ambition.


8
0:0:24,96 --> 0:0:27,96
Apple's hi-tech products
have inspired fervour.


9
0:0:27,96 --> 0:0:30,36
Oh, it's beautiful. It's very sexy.


10
0:0:30,36 --> 0:0:34,8
Defining cool consumerism
for a worldwide tribe.


11
0:0:34,8 --> 0:0:38,64
Hyped by the man
who personified the brand.


12
0:0:38,64 --> 0:0:40,4
It works like magic.


13
0:0:40,4 --> 0:0:42,6
They look so good,
you want to lick 'em.


14
0:0:42,6 --> 0:0:44,36
It's unbelievable.


15
0:0:44,36 --> 0:0:47,6
No-one had quite
that mixture of arrogance,


16
0:0:47,6 --> 0:0:50,48
humility, talent
and presence, which Steve Jobs had.


17
0:0:50,48 --> 0:0:55,32
He's changed music, he's changed
movies, he's changed computers
a couple of times.


18
0:0:55,32 --> 0:0:59,16
He's created industries
that we didn't think we needed.


19
0:0:59,16 --> 0:1:1,16
Jobs was a perfectionist.


20
0:1:1,16 --> 0:1:5,92
To Steve, everything was about
taste. Just like someone
writing a great piece of music.


21
0:1:5,92 --> 0:1:7,4
And a tyrant.


22
0:1:7,4 --> 0:1:10,32
Steve Jobs yelling at you with
his full force is kind of


23
0:1:10,32 --> 0:1:14,0
a pretty frightening thing
for most people.


24
0:1:14,0 --> 0:1:16,68
How did a drug-taking college
dropout


25
0:1:16,68 --> 0:1:19,84
create one of the most successful
corporations in the world?


26
0:1:19,84 --> 0:1:24,4
His hippy background made him
a better billionaire.


27
0:1:24,4 --> 0:1:26,0
This is the inside story


28
0:1:26,0 --> 0:1:28,12
of how Steve Jobs took Apple


29
0:1:28,12 --> 0:1:39,6
from a suburban garage
to global supremacy.


30
0:1:39,6 --> 0:1:44,88
This is the launch of the Macintosh
computer in 1984.


31
0:1:44,88 --> 0:1:48,48
An early glimpse of the way
Apple has marketed itself


32
0:1:48,48 --> 0:1:53,44
to the world ever since.


33
0:1:53,44 --> 0:2:5,8
MUSIC: "Chariots Of Fire"
by Vangelis


34
0:2:5,8 --> 0:2:7,32
The Macintosh was the first computer


35
0:2:7,32 --> 0:2:10,88
with a mouse that was meant
for all of us.


36
0:2:10,88 --> 0:2:14,32
It has turned out insanely great.


37
0:2:14,32 --> 0:2:19,56
APPLAUSE


38
0:2:19,56 --> 0:2:22,48
We were all very idealistic
and passionate.


39
0:2:22,48 --> 0:2:27,16
This was our personal cause.


40
0:2:27,16 --> 0:2:30,2
In this auditorium,
three crucial factors


41
0:2:30,2 --> 0:2:31,8
came together for the first time.


42
0:2:31,8 --> 0:2:35,48
A new computer designed to be
easier to use


43
0:2:35,48 --> 0:2:37,4
than any that
had come before.


44
0:2:37,4 --> 0:2:42,36
Sold with an audacious
message of revolution.


45
0:2:42,36 --> 0:2:46,0
And hyped by Steve Jobs himself.


46
0:2:46,0 --> 0:2:49,84
I'd like to open the meeting
with a an old poem by Dylan.
That's Bob Dylan.


47
0:2:49,84 --> 0:2:51,88
LAUGHTER


48
0:2:51,88 --> 0:2:55,24
Come writers and critics who
prophesise with your pens


49
0:2:55,24 --> 0:2:57,36
And keep your eyes wide...


50
0:2:57,36 --> 0:3:0,44
What started here in 1984,
with the launch of the Mac


51
0:3:0,44 --> 0:3:5,92
became the template that certainly
got improved upon as Apple became


52
0:3:5,92 --> 0:3:8,56
one of the great marketing companies
that the world has ever seen.


53
0:3:8,56 --> 0:3:11,24
..for the loser now
will be later to win


54
0:3:11,24 --> 0:3:13,64
for the times they are a-changin'.


55
0:3:13,64 --> 0:3:15,88
APPLAUSE


56
0:3:15,88 --> 0:3:18,72
The whole auditorium of about
2,500 people


57
0:3:18,72 --> 0:3:21,8
gave it a standing ovation.


58
0:3:21,8 --> 0:3:25,96
It was a very, very emotional moment
because it was no longer ours.


59
0:3:25,96 --> 0:3:29,68
From that day forward, it was no
loner ours, we couldn't change it.


60
0:3:29,68 --> 0:3:32,2
Jobs cast Apple
as the plucky underdog,


61
0:3:32,2 --> 0:3:34,32
taking on a domineering rival.


62
0:3:34,32 --> 0:3:37,0
IBM wants it all


63
0:3:37,0 --> 0:3:43,64
and is aiming its guns on its last
obstacle to industry control - Apple.


64
0:3:43,64 --> 0:3:48,6
Will big blue dominate
the entire computer industry?


65
0:3:48,6 --> 0:3:51,76
The entire information age?


66
0:3:51,76 --> 0:3:56,12
Was George Orwell right about 1984?


67
0:3:56,12 --> 0:3:57,92
APPLAUSE


68
0:3:57,92 --> 0:4:1,8
'We celebrate the first glorious
anniversary...'


69
0:4:1,8 --> 0:4:7,12
Apple created an advert
that painted IBM as Big Brother.


70
0:4:7,12 --> 0:4:9,32
the enemy of freedom.


71
0:4:9,32 --> 0:4:15,0
These images have helped define
Apple as a brand ever since.


72
0:4:15,0 --> 0:4:20,68
'We shall prevail.'


73
0:4:20,68 --> 0:4:24,2
That was the birth
of the Apple brand.


74
0:4:24,2 --> 0:4:26,56
It was talked about


75
0:4:26,56 --> 0:4:29,4
and it was literally
focusing on a revolution.


76
0:4:29,4 --> 0:4:32,96
And that revolutionary theme
was absolutely at the core


77
0:4:32,96 --> 0:4:36,32
of what made Apple successful
over the next years.


78
0:4:36,32 --> 0:4:38,72
The 1984 ad was the first time


79
0:4:38,72 --> 0:4:42,44
when you started to get a real
sense of the Apple club.


80
0:4:42,44 --> 0:4:45,32
People who defined themselves by
their association with the brand.


81
0:4:45,32 --> 0:4:48,72
That they weren't IBM clones,
they were these creative thinkers


82
0:4:48,72 --> 0:4:52,12
who had a different attitude,
in some way.


83
0:4:52,12 --> 0:4:54,6
I think that's been
the kind of common currency


84
0:4:54,6 --> 0:4:56,36
that's been carried on since then.


85
0:4:56,36 --> 0:4:59,0
Nearly three decades on,


86
0:4:59,0 --> 0:5:0,32
Apple was still following
the marketing template


87
0:5:0,32 --> 0:5:4,56
set out
all those years ago.


88
0:5:4,56 --> 0:5:8,24
This year, Steve Jobs was
centre stage for the launch


89
0:5:8,24 --> 0:5:9,84
of its latest tablet.


90
0:5:9,84 --> 0:5:13,52
And just like in 1984, his pitch


91
0:5:13,52 --> 0:5:17,76
was that Apple stands for something
more than selling computers.


92
0:5:17,76 --> 0:5:19,96
It's in Apple's DNA


93
0:5:19,96 --> 0:5:24,28
that technology alone is not enough.


94
0:5:24,28 --> 0:5:28,16
That it's technology
married with liberal arts,


95
0:5:28,16 --> 0:5:30,36
married with the humanities


96
0:5:30,36 --> 0:5:35,84
that yields us the result
that makes our hearts sing.


97
0:5:35,84 --> 0:5:38,8
From the launch of the Macintosh


98
0:5:38,8 --> 0:5:40,76
to the unveiling of the latest iPad,


99
0:5:40,76 --> 0:5:43,88
two events,
which span a quarter of a century,


100
0:5:43,88 --> 0:5:48,96
and yet which reveal a consistent
vision in the company Jobs created.


101
0:5:48,96 --> 0:5:51,92
It wasn't a vision
born of a business school education.


102
0:5:51,92 --> 0:5:54,12
It wasn't a product of consumer
focus groups.


103
0:5:54,12 --> 0:5:56,12
The roots of that vision


104
0:5:56,12 --> 0:6:3,68
lay in the Californian
counter culture in which he grew up.


105
0:6:3,68 --> 0:6:7,52
MUSIC: "The Times They Are
A-Changin'" by Bob Dylan


106
0:6:7,52 --> 0:6:12,4
# Come gather round, people
wherever you roam... #


107
0:6:12,4 --> 0:6:16,16
The young Steve Jobs
came to believe technology


108
0:6:16,16 --> 0:6:20,52
COULD change the world.


109
0:6:20,52 --> 0:6:23,56
In California in the 1960s and '70s,


110
0:6:23,56 --> 0:6:28,36
Jobs found himself at the centre
of two colliding worlds.


111
0:6:28,36 --> 0:6:29,6
The hippy movement


112
0:6:29,6 --> 0:6:31,68
and computers.


113
0:6:31,68 --> 0:6:37,64
# Oh, the times,
they are a-changin'... #


114
0:6:37,64 --> 0:6:40,8
We spent a lot of time
driving around in his old Volvo.


115
0:6:40,8 --> 0:6:44,68
I don't remember ever listening to
anything other than Bob Dylan tapes.


116
0:6:44,68 --> 0:6:48,2
We would play them
over and over again.


117
0:6:48,2 --> 0:6:53,24
Born in 1955,
Jobs was adopted by a modest family


118
0:6:53,24 --> 0:6:56,84
and grew up
in the Santa Clara Valley.


119
0:6:56,84 --> 0:6:59,72
It was becoming better known
as Silicon Valley


120
0:6:59,72 --> 0:7:7,64
as hi-tech firms sprang up.


121
0:7:7,64 --> 0:7:9,48
And nearby,


122
0:7:9,48 --> 0:7:12,92
San Francisco was becoming the
epicentre of the counter culture.


123
0:7:12,92 --> 0:7:16,64
Jobs opened himself up to both.


124
0:7:16,64 --> 0:7:19,6
He's got a lot of compartments
in his mind.


125
0:7:19,6 --> 0:7:25,96
He was intense and thoughtful
and I liked that about him.


126
0:7:25,96 --> 0:7:28,56
At college, Jobs met Daniel Kottke.


127
0:7:28,56 --> 0:7:31,56
Jobs quickly dropped out
of his course


128
0:7:31,56 --> 0:7:33,92
and lost no time tuning in.


129
0:7:33,92 --> 0:7:37,48
We both got copies of this new book,
Be Here Now.


130
0:7:37,48 --> 0:7:42,12
It was written by Ram Dass
and all about his trip to India,


131
0:7:42,12 --> 0:7:46,68
searching for a holy man who could
explain what psychedelics do.


132
0:7:46,68 --> 0:7:48,28
It was fascinating for me


133
0:7:48,28 --> 0:7:55,44
and for Steve also and so that was
the basis of our friendship.


134
0:7:55,44 --> 0:7:57,8
Jobs became a hippy,


135
0:7:57,8 --> 0:8:0,32
pursuing paths
to personal liberation.


136
0:8:0,32 --> 0:8:4,4
He and Kottke took their own
trip to India,


137
0:8:4,4 --> 0:8:24,2
and LSD, as this
extraordinary tape reveals.


138
0:8:24,2 --> 0:8:28,24
He spent long periods at a commune
on a farm in Oregon.


139
0:8:28,24 --> 0:8:32,96
We spent a whole week harvesting
apples and, while we were at it,


140
0:8:32,96 --> 0:8:36,68
we decided we would just fast
on apples and see how that worked


141
0:8:36,68 --> 0:8:38,68
and, um...


142
0:8:38,68 --> 0:8:42,32
it makes you very light-headed,
cos it's just like sugar.


143
0:8:42,32 --> 0:8:44,68
Jobs was inspired by
the counter culture


144
0:8:44,68 --> 0:8:48,6
to believe society was there
to be reshaped.


145
0:8:48,6 --> 0:8:49,84
As near as I can tell,


146
0:8:49,84 --> 0:8:53,48
Steve Jobs always had that ambition
to change the world.


147
0:8:53,48 --> 0:8:58,36
And he expected to do
that by empowering, um...


148
0:8:58,36 --> 0:9:1,0
everybody.


149
0:9:1,0 --> 0:9:4,24
But Jobs didn't share all the views
of his counter culture buddies.


150
0:9:4,24 --> 0:9:7,92
Many hippies saw computers
as tools of oppression,


151
0:9:7,92 --> 0:9:9,92
produced by big businesses


152
0:9:9,92 --> 0:9:13,8
to extend the sway
of other big businesses.


153
0:9:13,8 --> 0:9:18,88
Jobs, though, had grown up
experimenting with electronics
at home.


154
0:9:18,88 --> 0:9:20,52
People who've done that


155
0:9:20,52 --> 0:9:25,0
have another angle on, er,
whether technology is bad or good.


156
0:9:25,0 --> 0:9:29,32
They think that technology
that pushes them around is bad


157
0:9:29,32 --> 0:9:30,84
and technology that they can


158
0:9:30,84 --> 0:9:33,88
push in their own direction
they think is good.


159
0:9:33,88 --> 0:9:35,56
While he was still at school,


160
0:9:35,56 --> 0:9:39,84
Jobs worked at one of the big
computer companies near his home in
Silicon Valley.


161
0:9:39,84 --> 0:9:43,28
And he made a friend
who would shape his destiny.


162
0:9:43,28 --> 0:9:46,16
We talked about electronics.
I said, "I design computers.


163
0:9:46,16 --> 0:9:49,36
"I can, you know, do any of them."
He had worked at Hewlett Packard


164
0:9:49,36 --> 0:9:51,76
and built himself what's called
a frequency counter.


165
0:9:51,76 --> 0:9:52,96
So we hit it off.


166
0:9:52,96 --> 0:9:57,28
Despite his hippy outlook,
Jobs had a ruthless streak.


167
0:9:57,28 --> 0:10:2,28
He was asked by the fledgling
computer company Atari
to design a new Breakout game.


168
0:10:2,28 --> 0:10:5,4
Jobs asked Wozniak
to do it in just four days,


169
0:10:5,4 --> 0:10:8,16
telling his friend
they would share the fee.


170
0:10:8,16 --> 0:10:11,32
He presented it like we were
splitting the money 50/50,


171
0:10:11,32 --> 0:10:15,48
but actually, it was, you know,
probably a different story.


172
0:10:15,48 --> 0:10:19,0
Wozniak worked round the clock
to deliver the goods


173
0:10:19,0 --> 0:10:22,8
but later discovered Jobs
had paid him considerably less


174
0:10:22,8 --> 0:10:28,24
than half the sum
he had received from Atari.


175
0:10:28,24 --> 0:10:30,36
You didn't think,
"I can't trust this guy"?


176
0:10:30,36 --> 0:10:32,4
or "He's a bit too sharp for me"?


177
0:10:32,4 --> 0:10:33,72
Steve could have just said,


178
0:10:33,72 --> 0:10:36,96
"I need money to buy into
this commune up in Oregon."


179
0:10:36,96 --> 0:10:41,36
Have you never harboured any
bitterness that he might have?
I don't harbour bitterness.


180
0:10:41,36 --> 0:10:45,4
Even if somebody just did
that right to my face,
I would not harbour bitterness.


181
0:10:45,4 --> 0:10:48,68
But I would acknowledge
the truth. Um, I did cry.


182
0:10:48,68 --> 0:10:52,44
I cried, you know, quite a bit,
actually, when I read it in a book.


183
0:10:52,44 --> 0:10:58,0
The seeds of Apple were sown
when Wozniak introduced Jobs


184
0:10:58,0 --> 0:11:4,68
to a subterranean world
of DIY technology enthusiasts.


185
0:11:4,68 --> 0:11:9,56
The Homebrew Computer Club had ideas
of how small, little people


186
0:11:9,56 --> 0:11:11,24
who knew things about computers


187
0:11:11,24 --> 0:11:14,64
could change the world,
could become masters.


188
0:11:14,64 --> 0:11:17,52
The Homebrew Computer Club
took computing


189
0:11:17,52 --> 0:11:22,36
out of the hands of big business.


190
0:11:22,36 --> 0:11:26,8
What happened was you wanted
a computer or a piece of software


191
0:11:26,8 --> 0:11:28,8
or some product that didn't exist.


192
0:11:28,8 --> 0:11:30,72
You looked around, it didn't exist.
So you built it.


193
0:11:30,72 --> 0:11:34,0
Then you showed it to your friends,
cos everyone wants to show off,


194
0:11:34,0 --> 0:11:37,0
and your friends would say,
"This is great, can I have one?"


195
0:11:37,0 --> 0:11:41,4
The values were sharing. If you have
parts that can help people.


196
0:11:41,4 --> 0:11:43,68
If you have knowledge,
you'll share.


197
0:11:43,68 --> 0:11:46,56
Wozniak brought Jobs to
the Homebrew Computer Club


198
0:11:46,56 --> 0:11:50,88
where he was showing
a new computer he had made.


199
0:11:50,88 --> 0:11:53,84
It would become the Apple I.


200
0:11:53,84 --> 0:11:57,52
He saw a business opportunity that
all these people wanted to build


201
0:11:57,52 --> 0:12:1,8
my computer design, but
they didn't have building skills.


202
0:12:1,8 --> 0:12:3,96
And he thought,
"We'll put out some money,


203
0:12:3,96 --> 0:12:8,48
"design a PC board, we'll make
it for $20, we'll sell it for $40."


204
0:12:8,48 --> 0:12:12,12
And I didn't know if we'd sell
enough to get our money back.


205
0:12:12,12 --> 0:12:14,28
We'd have to sell about 50.


206
0:12:14,28 --> 0:12:17,8
And I didn't know if there were
50 people who would buy my computer.


207
0:12:17,8 --> 0:12:21,4
And Steve said, "Yeah, maybe we
won't get our money back,


208
0:12:21,4 --> 0:12:22,8
"but then for once in our lives,


209
0:12:22,8 --> 0:12:25,44
"finally, the two of us
will have our own company."


210
0:12:25,44 --> 0:12:29,56
Wow, man. He was...
OK, he was the leader on that.


211
0:12:29,56 --> 0:12:34,48
In 1976, Wozniak and Jobs
began selling the Apple I computer


212
0:12:34,48 --> 0:12:37,72
from the Jobs family garage.


213
0:12:37,72 --> 0:12:40,8
Buyers had to add their own case.


214
0:12:40,8 --> 0:12:44,0
The birth of Apple as a company
had been masterminded by Jobs,


215
0:12:44,0 --> 0:12:47,88
a hippy with a business brain.


216
0:12:47,88 --> 0:12:51,72
A surprising number of people
who came along as hippies


217
0:12:51,72 --> 0:12:54,16
and counter-culture
folks in the '60s and '70s


218
0:12:54,16 --> 0:12:56,92
wound up going into business.


219
0:12:56,92 --> 0:13:0,8
Business was a way to have
some freedom in the world.


220
0:13:0,8 --> 0:13:4,76
Steve Jobs later said he'd set up
the business almost by chance.


221
0:13:4,76 --> 0:13:8,4
We started Apple simply because we
wanted this computer for ourselves


222
0:13:8,4 --> 0:13:12,48
and our immediate friends wanted one
once they saw us build a prototype.


223
0:13:12,48 --> 0:13:14,68
So gradually,
we were pulled into business.


224
0:13:14,68 --> 0:13:16,8
We didn't set out to build
a large company.


225
0:13:16,8 --> 0:13:19,68
We started out to build computers
for us and our friends.


226
0:13:19,68 --> 0:13:25,28
To Apple's co-founder, the reality
is a little less idealistic.


227
0:13:25,28 --> 0:13:28,32
Steve was always sort of focussed
on if you can build things


228
0:13:28,32 --> 0:13:31,92
and sell them, you can have a
company. And the way you make money


229
0:13:31,92 --> 0:13:34,2
and importance in the world
is with companies.


230
0:13:34,2 --> 0:13:38,36
And he always spoke that he wanted
to be one of those important people.


231
0:13:38,36 --> 0:13:40,68
So he'd got the business side
pretty clearly.


232
0:13:40,68 --> 0:13:44,16
He got the business side but he did
tie it in philosophically with,


233
0:13:44,16 --> 0:13:47,4
"This is how you get
good things to people."


234
0:13:47,4 --> 0:13:51,6
It wasn't, "I only want money."


235
0:13:51,6 --> 0:13:53,48
It was Wozniak's next computer,


236
0:13:53,48 --> 0:13:56,24
which propelled Apple
into the stratosphere.


237
0:13:56,24 --> 0:13:58,16
Released in 1977,


238
0:13:58,16 --> 0:14:5,28
the Apple II was the first home
computer with colour graphics.


239
0:14:5,28 --> 0:14:8,24
Over the next three years,
sales grew rapidly


240
0:14:8,24 --> 0:14:11,0
to more than $150 million,


241
0:14:11,0 --> 0:14:16,24
taking Apple from a suburban garage
to the pinnacle of a new industry...


242
0:14:16,24 --> 0:14:18,28
personal computing.


243
0:14:18,28 --> 0:14:21,44
There are some great partnerships,
aren't there, in the world?


244
0:14:21,44 --> 0:14:24,32
One thinks of Lennon and McCartney
and you and Steve Jobs.


245
0:14:24,32 --> 0:14:26,4
Who was Lennon, who was McCartney?


246
0:14:26,4 --> 0:14:31,8
I am so honoured to be considered
in that kind of category,


247
0:14:31,8 --> 0:14:33,12
and yet it's true, it's true.


248
0:14:33,12 --> 0:14:35,96
You know, Steve and I,
we were like a...


249
0:14:35,96 --> 0:14:39,4
Lennon McCartney partnership,
exactly. I couldn't say who was who.


250
0:14:39,4 --> 0:14:42,32
I always thought people always
attributed me with Lennon


251
0:14:42,32 --> 0:14:46,12
because I had really built
and designed the machines.


252
0:14:46,12 --> 0:14:48,56
And then Steve knew how to take
it to the public.


253
0:14:48,56 --> 0:14:51,36
Um, but he had, you know,
his own type of brilliance too.


254
0:14:51,36 --> 0:14:56,44
When Apple went public in 1980,
it was the most over-subscribed


255
0:14:56,44 --> 0:15:1,16
offering of shares
since that of Ford motors in 1956.


256
0:15:1,16 --> 0:15:5,8
Success on this scale changed Apple.


257
0:15:5,8 --> 0:15:7,24
Any company when it becomes public


258
0:15:7,24 --> 0:15:11,4
and becomes bigger becomes
different. Politics seep in.


259
0:15:11,4 --> 0:15:15,72
The company goal from that point on
wasn't to change the world,


260
0:15:15,72 --> 0:15:18,6
but to increase
the value to shareholders.


261
0:15:18,6 --> 0:15:21,4
It certainly did that.


262
0:15:21,4 --> 0:15:24,56
It was worth nearly $2 billion
by the end of 1980.


263
0:15:24,56 --> 0:15:26,92
And Jobs had a quarter of a billion.


264
0:15:26,92 --> 0:15:30,36
But now money men and women
flooded in to Apple,


265
0:15:30,36 --> 0:15:34,64
and Jobs, just 25, wasn't really
taken seriously by them.


266
0:15:34,64 --> 0:15:39,32
Steve was the chairman, but
he wasn't seen as the person


267
0:15:39,32 --> 0:15:45,4
who had the stature
and the maturity to run the company.


268
0:15:45,4 --> 0:15:49,16
Especially as the world around Apple
was changing fast.


269
0:15:49,16 --> 0:15:52,52
Competition in the personal computer
market was intensifying.


270
0:15:52,52 --> 0:15:56,8
In 1981, IBM launched its response
to the Apple II -


271
0:15:56,8 --> 0:15:59,32
The IBM PC.


272
0:15:59,32 --> 0:16:3,8
'A computer expert will show you
the system that's right for you.'


273
0:16:3,8 --> 0:16:8,16
It was the opening shot of a battle
that would rage for 15 years.


274
0:16:8,16 --> 0:16:12,44
Apple went from the leading
personal computer company


275
0:16:12,44 --> 0:16:14,68
to the second-place company


276
0:16:14,68 --> 0:16:17,96
and actually, was in a very
precarious position in that


277
0:16:17,96 --> 0:16:24,4
because the IBM system could be used
in companies other than IBM


278
0:16:24,4 --> 0:16:31,12
and you could see where Apple would
fall further and further back.


279
0:16:31,12 --> 0:16:34,36
Apple needed a seasoned
Chief Executive to pilot the company


280
0:16:34,36 --> 0:16:37,4
through increasingly tough times.


281
0:16:37,4 --> 0:16:39,96
Steve Jobs' search took him
to New York


282
0:16:39,96 --> 0:16:44,32
and to John Sculley, President
of the soft drinks company, Pepsi.


283
0:16:44,32 --> 0:16:47,16
The two men began poles apart.


284
0:16:47,16 --> 0:16:49,2
The world I came from
was hierarchical.


285
0:16:49,2 --> 0:16:54,28
It was big business.
It was very competitive


286
0:16:54,28 --> 0:16:59,36
and the idea of building a company
that was going to change the world


287
0:16:59,36 --> 0:17:4,24
was completely foreign from anything
that I'd ever been exposed to.


288
0:17:4,24 --> 0:17:7,68
How Jobs persuaded Sculley
to take the job


289
0:17:7,68 --> 0:17:9,68
is the stuff of business legend.


290
0:17:9,68 --> 0:17:14,64
Steve had these deep penetrating,
brown eyes


291
0:17:14,64 --> 0:17:19,44
and he just stared right at me,
probably, you know, 15 inches away.


292
0:17:19,44 --> 0:17:22,84
He said, "Do you want to sell sugar
water for the rest of your life,


293
0:17:22,84 --> 0:17:27,16
"or do you want to come with me
and change the world?"


294
0:17:27,16 --> 0:17:28,96
Kind of knocked the wind out of me,


295
0:17:28,96 --> 0:17:32,52
because no-one had ever said
anything like that to me before.


296
0:17:32,52 --> 0:17:35,12
Sculley was a pragmatic operator,


297
0:17:35,12 --> 0:17:38,68
a marketing expert who knew exactly
what Apple should do.


298
0:17:38,68 --> 0:17:42,68
What they needed was someone
who could keep the Apple II


299
0:17:42,68 --> 0:17:47,28
commercially alive and generating
cash for about another three years.


300
0:17:47,28 --> 0:17:50,76
After several new product lines
had failed to take off,


301
0:17:50,76 --> 0:17:55,2
the income from the Apple II
was keeping the company alive.


302
0:17:55,2 --> 0:17:58,12
But Apple's hopes of a revival
rested on a new home computer,


303
0:17:58,12 --> 0:18:4,56
the Macintosh,
named after a variety of Apple.


304
0:18:4,56 --> 0:18:10,28
Jobs set out to build a computer
that would blow IBM's PC away.


305
0:18:10,28 --> 0:18:13,88
There was enough of the ordinary
corporate executive about him


306
0:18:13,88 --> 0:18:15,92
to want to beat a rival.


307
0:18:15,92 --> 0:18:19,16
But there was little else
conventional about Steve Jobs.


308
0:18:19,16 --> 0:18:22,48
He wanted computers to be simple
and pleasurable to use.


309
0:18:22,48 --> 0:18:26,48
He wanted our relationship with them
to be more human and intimate.


310
0:18:26,48 --> 0:18:35,24
And that approach to technology has
been Apple's hallmark ever since.


311
0:18:35,24 --> 0:18:38,68
The Macintosh team
was full of rebel spirit.


312
0:18:38,68 --> 0:18:42,84
We were all young, we were all
the same age, and we all thought


313
0:18:42,84 --> 0:18:45,72
we could do better
than has ever been done before.


314
0:18:45,72 --> 0:18:49,24
Jobs thought it would take a year
to build the Macintosh.


315
0:18:49,24 --> 0:18:51,24
In fact, it would take
more than three.


316
0:18:51,24 --> 0:18:55,32
He's got a "reality
distortion field".


317
0:18:55,32 --> 0:18:57,0
Steve wanted the impossible


318
0:18:57,0 --> 0:18:59,72
and he was somehow able
to convince everyone


319
0:18:59,72 --> 0:19:2,64
that the impossible was possible.


320
0:19:2,64 --> 0:19:7,32
Jobs was determined
the Macintosh would be easy to use.


321
0:19:7,32 --> 0:19:10,24
It would have a mouse
and icons on screen,


322
0:19:10,24 --> 0:19:13,56
a first for an affordable
personal computer.


323
0:19:13,56 --> 0:19:16,24
The story of how Jobs brought
that mouse to the world


324
0:19:16,24 --> 0:19:18,8
explodes a myth about him -


325
0:19:18,8 --> 0:19:21,36
That he invented revolutionary
technology.


326
0:19:21,36 --> 0:19:25,72
You see, Jobs didn't
operate in an intellectual vacuum.


327
0:19:25,72 --> 0:19:31,28
Nearby, in Silicon Valley, the Xerox
corporation had a research division


328
0:19:31,28 --> 0:19:32,32
called PARC.


329
0:19:32,32 --> 0:19:36,44
'And the function of spatial
frequency is something like this.'


330
0:19:36,44 --> 0:19:40,68
It was full of free-thinking
technological radicals


331
0:19:40,68 --> 0:19:42,24
and inspirational ideas.


332
0:19:42,24 --> 0:19:46,12
It was just a kind of dream place.


333
0:19:46,12 --> 0:19:51,8
We had a general overall
vision about what we called


334
0:19:51,8 --> 0:19:52,88
"the office of the future."


335
0:19:52,88 --> 0:19:56,4
And that was it. We were told
to figure out how to do that.


336
0:19:56,4 --> 0:19:59,16
Jobs was desperate
to take a look inside


337
0:19:59,16 --> 0:20:1,44
this precious storehouse of ideas.


338
0:20:1,44 --> 0:20:5,0
He got his chance when Xerox
made an investment in Apple


339
0:20:5,0 --> 0:20:7,72
and invited him in.


340
0:20:7,72 --> 0:20:11,8
I demonstrated various technologies
that our group had,


341
0:20:11,8 --> 0:20:13,76
but the things that stood out
to the visitors


342
0:20:13,76 --> 0:20:17,96
were the pointing device, the mouse,
which we hadn't invented.


343
0:20:17,96 --> 0:20:20,68
It had been around for 15 years.
We had just improved it,


344
0:20:20,68 --> 0:20:23,92
but it wasn't something that most
people had ever seen before.


345
0:20:23,92 --> 0:20:27,56
Larry Tesler was demonstrating how
a computer with icons


346
0:20:27,56 --> 0:20:32,44
on the screen could be controlled by
this novel gadget. A mouse.


347
0:20:32,44 --> 0:20:35,48
Jobs couldn't believe
what he was seeing.


348
0:20:35,48 --> 0:20:39,52
He started pacing around the room
very nervously almost,


349
0:20:39,52 --> 0:20:43,24
and then more excitedly and then
he just couldn't hold it back.


350
0:20:43,24 --> 0:20:44,72
He just had to talk.


351
0:20:44,72 --> 0:20:50,32
So, he started saying things like,
"You're sitting on a gold mine.


352
0:20:50,32 --> 0:20:53,36
"This is insanely great.
It is just amazing.


353
0:20:53,36 --> 0:20:55,56
"Why aren't you doing
anything with this?"


354
0:20:55,56 --> 0:21:0,52
Unlike the vast XEROX corporation,
Jobs acted swiftly.


355
0:21:0,52 --> 0:21:2,88
I went into his office,
sat down and said,


356
0:21:2,88 --> 0:21:6,28
"Steve, I've been thinking
about a few product ideas"


357
0:21:6,28 --> 0:21:10,6
and hardly had I got the sentence
out and he said, "Stop, Dean.


358
0:21:10,6 --> 0:21:12,56
"I know exactly what we need to do."


359
0:21:12,56 --> 0:21:15,76
When he said "a mouse",
I looked at him and said "A mouse?"


360
0:21:15,76 --> 0:21:18,28
I had no clue what a mouse was.


361
0:21:18,28 --> 0:21:23,48
Xerox saw the mouse as part
of an expensive business computer.


362
0:21:23,48 --> 0:21:25,24
Jobs saw it very differently.


363
0:21:25,24 --> 0:21:27,4
He gave me
a very clear design brief.


364
0:21:27,4 --> 0:21:29,12
The mouse had to have four things.


365
0:21:29,12 --> 0:21:33,36
The first was we had to be able
to build it for less than $15.


366
0:21:33,36 --> 0:21:37,0
Low cost consumer product. Secondly,
it had to last for two years.


367
0:21:37,0 --> 0:21:40,68
Third, it needed to work on a
regular desktop, Formica or metal.


368
0:21:40,68 --> 0:21:43,6
And then, finally,
he leaned back in his chair,


369
0:21:43,6 --> 0:21:46,76
put his hand on his knee and he
said, "And work on my Levi's."


370
0:21:46,76 --> 0:21:49,4
The mouse,
as we now know it, was born.


371
0:21:49,4 --> 0:21:53,28
Jobs had tweaked existing
technology to great effect,


372
0:21:53,28 --> 0:21:56,52
just as he would over
the next three decades.


373
0:21:56,52 --> 0:22:0,96
More editor than inventor,
Jobs had an instinct for innovation,


374
0:22:0,96 --> 0:22:3,44
pouncing on a good idea
when he saw one.


375
0:22:3,44 --> 0:22:9,92
The difference between invention
and innovation is that you execute.


376
0:22:9,92 --> 0:22:12,76
You take an, an idea
and you turn it into reality.


377
0:22:12,76 --> 0:22:16,44
You bring it into the marketplace.
Steve connected the dots.


378
0:22:16,44 --> 0:22:19,8
He saw a little bit of this,
he saw a little bit of that,


379
0:22:19,8 --> 0:22:20,68
and he said, "We need to do this.


380
0:22:20,68 --> 0:22:23,72
"We need to take it from an
expensive business experience


381
0:22:23,72 --> 0:22:29,4
"to a personal low-cost experience
and we'll build a company from it."


382
0:22:29,4 --> 0:22:32,48
Along with making the Macintosh
easy to use,


383
0:22:32,48 --> 0:22:35,12
Jobs brought
an aesthetic sensibility


384
0:22:35,12 --> 0:22:36,76
to the computer's design.


385
0:22:36,76 --> 0:22:39,8
A long-time follower
of Zen meditation,


386
0:22:39,8 --> 0:22:42,4
he believed in the beauty
of simplicity.


387
0:22:42,4 --> 0:22:44,84
When I went to his home
for the first time,


388
0:22:44,84 --> 0:22:49,8
I was struck because there was
almost no furniture in the house.


389
0:22:49,8 --> 0:22:53,44
Um...in his bedroom was a small bed,


390
0:22:53,44 --> 0:22:55,84
a photograph of Einstein
over his bed,


391
0:22:55,84 --> 0:22:58,16
another photograph of Gandhi.


392
0:22:58,16 --> 0:23:1,96
In the living room
was a Tiffany lamp,


393
0:23:1,96 --> 0:23:5,32
no place to sit. You know,
we would just sit on the floor.


394
0:23:5,32 --> 0:23:7,44
Steve just was not into possessions.


395
0:23:7,44 --> 0:23:10,44
He was not into money,
he was completely into


396
0:23:10,44 --> 0:23:14,32
the things he believed in.


397
0:23:14,32 --> 0:23:18,4
That integrity went through every
aspect of his life.


398
0:23:18,4 --> 0:23:24,24
His devotion to the products,
to the work, to the ethic.


399
0:23:24,24 --> 0:23:28,44
It permeated everything
and this desire for aesthetic beauty


400
0:23:28,44 --> 0:23:32,0
the importance of the things
that you don't see,


401
0:23:32,0 --> 0:23:36,44
what lies beneath the surface,
and in that sense,


402
0:23:36,44 --> 0:23:39,2
I think there's
a kind of seamless philosophy


403
0:23:39,2 --> 0:23:43,76
that binds everything together.


404
0:23:43,76 --> 0:23:47,36
As the Macintosh neared completion,


405
0:23:47,36 --> 0:23:50,4
the stakes were growing
higher for Apple.


406
0:23:50,4 --> 0:23:53,32
In autumn 1983,
the company's share price tumbled,


407
0:23:53,32 --> 0:23:56,88
wiping nearly half a billion
dollars from its value.


408
0:23:56,88 --> 0:23:59,88
A new home computer
was on its way from IBM


409
0:23:59,88 --> 0:24:3,92
and other versions of the PC
were flooding the market.


410
0:24:3,92 --> 0:24:7,92
Worse still, the man Apple had
turned to, to write extra software


411
0:24:7,92 --> 0:24:10,56
for the Mac was about to
steal a march on them.


412
0:24:10,56 --> 0:24:16,68
Relations with the young Bill Gates
were strained from the start.


413
0:24:16,68 --> 0:24:18,72
Bill Gates would
fly down from Seattle,


414
0:24:18,72 --> 0:24:22,16
down to Cupertino to give
updates on the project.


415
0:24:22,16 --> 0:24:26,84
And, often times, Steve would just
yell at Bill for two straight hours.


416
0:24:26,84 --> 0:24:33,28
And then Bill would leave
and get on a plane and fly back.


417
0:24:33,28 --> 0:24:36,72
We tend to think of Bill Gates
as a buttoned-up geek,


418
0:24:36,72 --> 0:24:41,48
but in this instance, it was Jobs
who showed he was far from laidback.


419
0:24:41,48 --> 0:24:46,12
He thought Apple
should keep complete control
of its software and hardware,


420
0:24:46,12 --> 0:24:50,16
Gates wanted to produce
software for both Apple and the PC.


421
0:24:50,16 --> 0:24:55,12
Tensions came to a head when they
were both working on the Macintosh.


422
0:24:55,12 --> 0:24:58,52
Jobs began to suspect Gates
might be taking advantage


423
0:24:58,52 --> 0:25:2,0
of his inside knowledge
of Apple's work.


424
0:25:2,0 --> 0:25:5,24
Steve Jobs was racing to ensure
the Macintosh


425
0:25:5,24 --> 0:25:9,8
was the first personal computer
to have icons on the screen.


426
0:25:9,8 --> 0:25:12,16
But just before it was due
to be unveiled,


427
0:25:12,16 --> 0:25:15,76
Microsoft suddenly announced
Windows I for the PC,


428
0:25:15,76 --> 0:25:18,8
which Apple feared would be similar.


429
0:25:18,8 --> 0:25:20,84
Jobs couldn't contain his fury.


430
0:25:20,84 --> 0:25:23,12
Steve was saying, "How can
you do this to us?


431
0:25:23,12 --> 0:25:24,92
"We trusted you, you betrayed us."


432
0:25:24,92 --> 0:25:29,56
And I was impressed with
Bill Gate's demeanour


433
0:25:29,56 --> 0:25:33,52
because Steve Jobs yelling at you
with his full force is kind of a...


434
0:25:33,52 --> 0:25:35,76
a pretty frightening
thing for most people!


435
0:25:35,76 --> 0:25:38,96
But he was kind of cool and calm.


436
0:25:38,96 --> 0:25:41,84
Just looked Steve back in the eye
and said, "Well, Steve,


437
0:25:41,84 --> 0:25:44,8
"you know, what you're saying is one
way of looking at it,


438
0:25:44,8 --> 0:25:46,32
"but I look at it a different way.


439
0:25:46,32 --> 0:25:49,12
"It's more like you had a rich
neighbour named Xerox


440
0:25:49,12 --> 0:25:52,48
"and I broke into their house
to steal the television set


441
0:25:52,48 --> 0:25:58,16
"and found you had
stolen it before I could."


442
0:25:58,16 --> 0:26:2,8
Finally, after three years
and millions of dollars,


443
0:26:2,8 --> 0:26:6,92
the Macintosh computer was ready.


444
0:26:6,92 --> 0:26:9,2
It was the distillation
of Steve Jobs' vision


445
0:26:9,2 --> 0:26:11,64
of what technology should be.


446
0:26:11,64 --> 0:26:13,88
Easy to use, intimate,


447
0:26:13,88 --> 0:26:17,6
intended to change
the lives of ordinary people.


448
0:26:17,6 --> 0:26:22,6
The future of Apple rested on
this strikingly-designed beige box.


449
0:26:22,6 --> 0:26:26,64
Computers before the Macintosh
kept us at arms length.


450
0:26:26,64 --> 0:26:29,92
The only way we can control them
was through painstakingly moving


451
0:26:29,92 --> 0:26:32,16
this crazy little cursor
on the screen


452
0:26:32,16 --> 0:26:37,24
and it looked like an alien device
with these glowing green letters.


453
0:26:37,24 --> 0:26:39,48
The Macintosh put it
on human scale.


454
0:26:39,48 --> 0:26:42,92
COMPUTER: Hello, I am Macintosh.


455
0:26:42,92 --> 0:26:47,2
For the first time it was actually,
you know, intuitive.


456
0:26:47,2 --> 0:26:49,84
If you were bright enough
to walk around unaided,


457
0:26:49,84 --> 0:26:52,48
you could just turn it on
and use it.


458
0:26:52,48 --> 0:26:55,12
The Macintosh would be a hit
with graphic designers


459
0:26:55,12 --> 0:26:57,76
and create the desktop
publishing era.


460
0:26:57,76 --> 0:27:0,2
Those of us who used Apples,
who got up early


461
0:27:0,2 --> 0:27:1,84
because we were excited about
the fact


462
0:27:1,84 --> 0:27:7,8
we were in a world full of glide
and flow and smoothness and pleasure,


463
0:27:7,8 --> 0:27:12,0
were told that we were pretentious,
posing, bohemian arty types.


464
0:27:12,0 --> 0:27:17,24
"It's all very well for you, but
I've got to do officey things",


465
0:27:17,24 --> 0:27:19,92
were missing the point.


466
0:27:19,92 --> 0:27:24,52
But however good it was,
the Mac cost $2,500,


467
0:27:24,52 --> 0:27:28,64
over $1,000 more than an IBM PC.


468
0:27:28,64 --> 0:27:33,32
Even so, Steve Jobs was in no doubt
it would take the world by storm.


469
0:27:33,32 --> 0:27:36,52
Like all great entrepreneurs,
in Steve's mind,


470
0:27:36,52 --> 0:27:40,72
"Why wouldn't everybody on
the planet immediately buy a Mac"?


471
0:27:40,72 --> 0:27:42,64
So he had huge expectations.


472
0:27:42,64 --> 0:27:45,68
Expectations that were about
to collide with the real world.


473
0:27:45,68 --> 0:27:49,0
Then the sales numbers
started coming in


474
0:27:49,0 --> 0:27:52,8
and, at best, they were
half of what we were expecting.


475
0:27:52,8 --> 0:27:55,64
One of Steve's great strengths
is his strong will


476
0:27:55,64 --> 0:27:58,6
and imposing his own
version of reality.


477
0:27:58,6 --> 0:28:4,8
So in the face of depressing sales
numbers he wasn't really fazed.


478
0:28:4,8 --> 0:28:8,24
Apple's new Macintosh factory
was running at 50% of capacity.


479
0:28:8,24 --> 0:28:12,36
We did lose money and that was
a huge crisis for everybody.


480
0:28:12,36 --> 0:28:15,96
Of course, that
engendered a panic at Apple.


481
0:28:15,96 --> 0:28:19,2
You know, "What was the problem?
How can we fix it?"


482
0:28:19,2 --> 0:28:24,88
And there, there was disagreement
between different people.


483
0:28:24,88 --> 0:28:28,52
The most serious disagreement
was between Steve Jobs


484
0:28:28,52 --> 0:28:32,24
and the man he had made
Chief Executive, John Sculley.


485
0:28:32,24 --> 0:28:35,24
Steve has a tendency to be
binary about people


486
0:28:35,24 --> 0:28:38,48
You know, sort of,
he flipped on John Sculley.


487
0:28:38,48 --> 0:28:44,64
The two men were battling
over the future of Apple.


488
0:28:44,64 --> 0:28:47,24
I was focused on
the cash-flow of the Apple II.


489
0:28:47,24 --> 0:28:49,24
We had to have that coming in.


490
0:28:49,24 --> 0:28:52,36
Steve wanted to drop
the price of the Macintosh,


491
0:28:52,36 --> 0:28:54,96
and put more marketing
against the Macintosh.


492
0:28:54,96 --> 0:28:56,8
I felt we couldn't afford that.


493
0:28:56,8 --> 0:29:0,16
30-year-old Jobs had picked a fight
with a formidable foe.


494
0:29:0,16 --> 0:29:3,28
Sculley came from PepsiCo,
a very political organisation,


495
0:29:3,28 --> 0:29:5,92
and he was a skilful infighter


496
0:29:5,92 --> 0:29:12,64
who knew how to play the games,
and Steve didn't.


497
0:29:12,64 --> 0:29:15,28
I said, "Steve, I'm going
to the board of directors."


498
0:29:15,28 --> 0:29:17,12
He didn't think I'd do that,
but I did,


499
0:29:17,12 --> 0:29:20,44
and the board said,
"We agree with John.


500
0:29:20,44 --> 0:29:22,36
"We don't agree with you, Steve."


501
0:29:22,36 --> 0:29:27,48
They asked Steve to step down
from heading the Macintosh division.


502
0:29:27,48 --> 0:29:31,28
Jobs had been forced
out of the company he had created.


503
0:29:31,28 --> 0:29:35,48
It was a humiliating
taste of failure.


504
0:29:35,48 --> 0:29:38,84
I got a phone call,
late at night and it was Steve.


505
0:29:38,84 --> 0:29:43,4
He sounded really despondent
and very, very sad.


506
0:29:43,4 --> 0:29:46,88
And I knew he was all alone
at his great big unfurnished mansion


507
0:29:46,88 --> 0:29:48,36
up in Woodside.


508
0:29:48,36 --> 0:29:51,64
I got in my car, drove up there,
and it was totally dark


509
0:29:51,64 --> 0:29:54,2
and rather creepy,
and I found the house


510
0:29:54,2 --> 0:29:58,56
and went in and climbed up
stairs by myself and found him


511
0:29:58,56 --> 0:30:3,76
in his bedroom just laying down
and he was very, very sad.


512
0:30:3,76 --> 0:30:7,4
And I just stayed there,
as a friend.


513
0:30:7,4 --> 0:30:10,92
11 years later,
Jobs was still bitter.


514
0:30:10,92 --> 0:30:13,16
What can I say?
I hired the wrong guy.


515
0:30:13,16 --> 0:30:15,56
That was Sculley? Yeah,


516
0:30:15,56 --> 0:30:22,52
and, er, he destroyed everything
I'd spent ten years working for.


517
0:30:22,52 --> 0:30:26,8
Erm, starting with me,
but that wasn't the saddest part.


518
0:30:26,8 --> 0:30:31,92
I'd have gladly left Apple if Apple
had turned out like I wanted it to.


519
0:30:31,92 --> 0:30:38,4
Sacking Jobs seemed natural to the
man schooled in selling sugar water.


520
0:30:38,4 --> 0:30:42,2
In hindsight, that was a terrible
decision. I was part of it.


521
0:30:42,2 --> 0:30:47,0
Coming from my vantage point,
out of corporate America,


522
0:30:47,0 --> 0:30:50,52
people were asked
to step down all the time
when there were disagreements


523
0:30:50,52 --> 0:30:55,6
so I didn't appreciate what it
meant to be a founder of a business,


524
0:30:55,6 --> 0:30:57,96
the visionary of the business.


525
0:30:57,96 --> 0:31:0,28
I was focused on
how do we sell Apple computers,


526
0:31:0,28 --> 0:31:4,96
he was focused on
how do we change the world?


527
0:31:4,96 --> 0:31:8,12
Jobs severed all ties with Apple,
except one.


528
0:31:8,12 --> 0:31:11,28
He kept a single share in the
company he had founded,


529
0:31:11,28 --> 0:31:16,56
selling off the rest
for more than $100 million.


530
0:31:16,56 --> 0:31:21,44
He hated the company. He couldn't see
that it would succeed without him.


531
0:31:21,44 --> 0:31:24,48
He didn't want it
to succeed without him.


532
0:31:24,48 --> 0:31:27,96
Over the next 11 years,
Jobs didn't relent.


533
0:31:27,96 --> 0:31:34,88
Once again centre stage,
he set up a new company called Next,
building high spec computers.


534
0:31:34,88 --> 0:31:38,76
With cases made of magnesium
and a price to match,
they didn't sell well.


535
0:31:38,76 --> 0:31:42,28
Though one important computer
scientist was impressed.


536
0:31:42,28 --> 0:31:43,8
Steve Jobs had arranged that,


537
0:31:43,8 --> 0:31:45,48
whenever you get a Next machine,


538
0:31:45,48 --> 0:31:47,4
there would be a message from him.


539
0:31:47,4 --> 0:31:53,32
One of the things I remember he said
was that it's not just about personal
computing, which was the rage,


540
0:31:53,32 --> 0:31:57,56
he said this should be about
interpersonal computing.


541
0:31:57,56 --> 0:32:2,28
And I thought, yeah, that's...
Yeah, he's got it.


542
0:32:2,28 --> 0:32:7,32
Jobs recognised technology was on
the cusp of allowing us
to communicate through computers.


543
0:32:7,32 --> 0:32:12,4
And, in fact, the Next's powerful
operating system


544
0:32:12,4 --> 0:32:16,48
helped Sir Tim Berners-Lee connect
computer users together.


545
0:32:16,48 --> 0:32:20,52
I developed the World Wide Web
on this Next machine
in a couple of months,


546
0:32:20,52 --> 0:32:23,64
whereas on another machine
it would've taken me a lot longer.


547
0:32:23,64 --> 0:32:26,96
YOU ARE A TOY!


548
0:32:26,96 --> 0:32:29,44
As well as high-tech,


549
0:32:29,44 --> 0:32:32,72
Jobs invested in a struggling
computer animation company.


550
0:32:32,72 --> 0:32:36,96
He ploughed $50 million into Pixar,
keeping it afloat


551
0:32:36,96 --> 0:32:40,72
until it created the first
computer-animated feature film.


552
0:32:40,72 --> 0:32:43,64
Toy Story was a blockbuster,


553
0:32:43,64 --> 0:32:47,0
and taking Pixar public made
Steve Jobs super rich.


554
0:32:47,0 --> 0:32:50,84
He did stay in there
and made the company successful,


555
0:32:50,84 --> 0:32:53,4
and we made him
a billionaire in return.


556
0:32:53,4 --> 0:32:55,32
Seems like a pretty good deal.


557
0:32:55,32 --> 0:32:59,52
Now the hippy computer mogul
had become a Hollywood player.


558
0:32:59,52 --> 0:33:3,24
Jobs had the world,
but he didn't have Apple.


559
0:33:3,24 --> 0:33:6,76
They say that there are no second
acts in American life,


560
0:33:6,76 --> 0:33:8,48
but there clearly are.


561
0:33:8,48 --> 0:33:11,76
One of the astonishing things
about the Apple phenomenon


562
0:33:11,76 --> 0:33:15,96
is it goes in two halves.


563
0:33:15,96 --> 0:33:18,8
In the 11 years
since Jobs left Apple,


564
0:33:18,8 --> 0:33:21,24
the computer market
had changed radically.


565
0:33:21,24 --> 0:33:25,56
Now Microsoft was the dominant
force in computing.


566
0:33:25,56 --> 0:33:31,0
Its operating systems powered
nearly 90% of personal
computers in America.


567
0:33:31,0 --> 0:33:32,88
Apple had tried to compete


568
0:33:32,88 --> 0:33:37,88
by allowing other manufacturers
to make and sell copies
of its machines and software,


569
0:33:37,88 --> 0:33:41,16
but it wasn't working.


570
0:33:41,16 --> 0:33:43,96
The company had
lost its lead in the computer market,


571
0:33:43,96 --> 0:33:48,96
customers were leaving in droves, the
company had no future, no roadmap.


572
0:33:48,96 --> 0:33:54,4
The company was in serious trouble.


573
0:33:54,4 --> 0:33:58,32
I, and other Apple users,
were being told with malicious grins


574
0:33:58,32 --> 0:34:1,92
from our Windows-using friends that
if we wanted to keep our machines


575
0:34:1,92 --> 0:34:6,56
we'd have to go to hobbyist shops
because there would be
no Apple computer.


576
0:34:6,56 --> 0:34:12,4
At Next, Jobs had focused
on developing its powerful
operating system.


577
0:34:12,4 --> 0:34:16,48
Apple needed just such a system.


578
0:34:16,48 --> 0:34:18,8
Apple was in technical trouble.


579
0:34:18,8 --> 0:34:25,0
Next was absolutely in financial
trouble, and the two came together.


580
0:34:25,0 --> 0:34:29,12
Apple bought Next for $400 million.


581
0:34:29,12 --> 0:34:33,92
It got the new operating system
it needed, and Steve Jobs.


582
0:34:33,92 --> 0:34:38,0
Steve was truly excited to be linked
up with Apple again.


583
0:34:38,0 --> 0:34:43,12
It was the company he founded,
the company he was kicked out of.


584
0:34:43,12 --> 0:34:46,76
It's the company that had lost
its way, it was starting to fail,


585
0:34:46,76 --> 0:34:52,8
so he had this opportunity to go back
and start fixing Apple at large.


586
0:34:52,8 --> 0:34:57,96
A few days later,
Apple revealed just how much trouble
it was really in.


587
0:34:57,96 --> 0:35:2,2
They announced that they were going
to lose something like $1 billion,


588
0:35:2,2 --> 0:35:5,92
and back then $1 billion
was a lot of money.


589
0:35:5,92 --> 0:35:10,32
I said, "Steve,
what did we just get ourselves into?"


590
0:35:10,32 --> 0:35:14,6
And he was wondering himself! Because
this was a big surprise to us.


591
0:35:14,6 --> 0:35:17,0
To bring Apple back from the brink,


592
0:35:17,0 --> 0:35:19,4
Jobs had a conventional
business challenge.


593
0:35:19,4 --> 0:35:21,8
He had to stop the company
haemorrhaging money,


594
0:35:21,8 --> 0:35:23,56
but he also had to do more.


595
0:35:23,56 --> 0:35:27,8
He had to help the company
rediscover itself,


596
0:35:27,8 --> 0:35:31,0
and for that he thought he needed to
take it back to the future,


597
0:35:31,0 --> 0:35:35,72
to the values that had built it
up in the first place.


598
0:35:35,72 --> 0:35:40,16
He decided to put all of Apple's
products and people under review.


599
0:35:40,16 --> 0:35:47,32
He was demanding, erm, he would not
hesitate to call someone
at two o'clock in the morning


600
0:35:47,32 --> 0:35:50,12
if he had an idea
that he wanted to be pursued.


601
0:35:50,12 --> 0:35:53,56
He had no time for people
that he did not respect.


602
0:35:53,56 --> 0:35:56,84
It got so bad that people
were afraid to get into the elevator
with Steve.


603
0:35:56,84 --> 0:35:59,36
He was on the fourth floor
of the first building


604
0:35:59,36 --> 0:36:2,8
when you first come in, and it's
been rumoured that he's fired people


605
0:36:2,8 --> 0:36:7,36
in that 25-second elevator ride
as he walked out of the elevator.


606
0:36:7,36 --> 0:36:11,16
It wasn't just people who were axed.


607
0:36:11,16 --> 0:36:15,12
Jobs ended the licensing of Apple's
technology to other companies,


608
0:36:15,12 --> 0:36:17,88
and he killed off most of Apple's
product lines,


609
0:36:17,88 --> 0:36:24,88
including a clunky handheld
device, the Newton.


610
0:36:24,88 --> 0:36:27,92
He taught the company what
he learned


611
0:36:27,92 --> 0:36:30,36
when he was at Next and Pixar,


612
0:36:30,36 --> 0:36:33,8
which was focus matters.


613
0:36:33,8 --> 0:36:36,4
Watching expenses matters.


614
0:36:36,4 --> 0:36:40,28
We'll do more if we do less.


615
0:36:40,28 --> 0:36:43,68
Here's to the crazy ones.


616
0:36:43,68 --> 0:36:45,68
The misfits, the rebels.


617
0:36:45,68 --> 0:36:47,72
The troublemakers.


618
0:36:47,72 --> 0:36:51,92
Always the marketing man,
now Jobs started to talk Apple up


619
0:36:51,92 --> 0:36:54,96
with a TV advert called
Think Different.


620
0:36:54,96 --> 0:37:1,4
This emotional recasting
of Apple's rebel roots
was about more than just the brand.


621
0:37:1,4 --> 0:37:4,64
The real reason Think Different was
created was for the employees.


622
0:37:4,64 --> 0:37:9,16
It really meant a wake-up,
a call to action,


623
0:37:9,16 --> 0:37:11,8
a call to arms for the employees to
say, "Wait a minute,


624
0:37:11,8 --> 0:37:14,68
"we still have something great to
do for the world."


625
0:37:14,68 --> 0:37:19,92
Because the people who are crazy
enough to think they can
change the world...


626
0:37:19,92 --> 0:37:26,84
..are the ones who do.


627
0:37:26,84 --> 0:37:30,0
After renewing Apple's sense
of its own identity,


628
0:37:30,0 --> 0:37:34,72
Jobs needed a product
that could bring about
the company's financial revival.


629
0:37:34,72 --> 0:37:38,48
He had a new vision
of what computers could be,


630
0:37:38,48 --> 0:37:43,92
and it centred on an unknown Apple
employee, British designer
Jonathan Ive,


631
0:37:43,92 --> 0:37:47,88
who'd been working on an unusual
prototype for a new computer.


632
0:37:47,88 --> 0:37:50,72
He went into Steve's office,
and he came out ten minutes later,


633
0:37:50,72 --> 0:37:54,72
and sort of leant against the wall,
not quite believing what he'd heard,


634
0:37:54,72 --> 0:38:0,4
which was, "We're going to stop
everything at Apple and we're going
to make this prototype of yours."


635
0:38:0,4 --> 0:38:5,0
Johnny said, "You do know that the
prototype is transparent and that's
how I want it to be?"


636
0:38:5,0 --> 0:38:9,28
Steve said, "Sure."


637
0:38:9,28 --> 0:38:12,52
This...is iMac.


638
0:38:12,52 --> 0:38:16,6
APPLAUSE


639
0:38:16,6 --> 0:38:22,32
The whole thing is translucent,
you can see into it. It's so cool.


640
0:38:22,32 --> 0:38:27,96
Jobs and Ive had put the design
of the computer centre stage.


641
0:38:27,96 --> 0:38:30,6
It created quite a stir.


642
0:38:30,6 --> 0:38:34,48
It looks like it's from another
planet, and a good planet!


643
0:38:34,48 --> 0:38:36,28
AUDIENCE LAUGHTER


644
0:38:36,28 --> 0:38:39,96
A planet with better designers.


645
0:38:39,96 --> 0:38:43,0
Behold this extraordinary
transparent object.


646
0:38:43,0 --> 0:38:44,4
It was friendly!


647
0:38:44,4 --> 0:38:48,16
It's a silly thing to say!
It looked like a nice thing to own.


648
0:38:48,16 --> 0:38:52,52
The back of this thing looks better
than the front of the other guy's
by the way!


649
0:38:52,52 --> 0:38:54,8
This was a desktop computer


650
0:38:54,8 --> 0:38:58,68
but conceived as a thing of
pleasure, ironic fascination.


651
0:38:58,68 --> 0:39:2,8
It meant that, you know,
a computer wasn't just a dreary
piece of office equipment.


652
0:39:2,8 --> 0:39:5,32
They look so good,
you kind of want to lick 'em.


653
0:39:5,32 --> 0:39:11,8
The iMac fused striking design
with the ability to connect
to the internet easily.


654
0:39:11,8 --> 0:39:13,36
Steve was super-proud of the design


655
0:39:13,36 --> 0:39:17,36
and also the idea that he called it
the iMac and the "i" for internet.


656
0:39:17,36 --> 0:39:19,64
The "i" was a stroke
of deft branding,


657
0:39:19,64 --> 0:39:25,84
transforming the new impersonal
internet into something
more intimate.


658
0:39:25,84 --> 0:39:30,44
The iMac was a huge success and
propelled Apple back into profit.


659
0:39:30,44 --> 0:39:34,88
In four and a half months,
iMac has become the number one
selling computer in America.


660
0:39:34,88 --> 0:39:39,4
The iMac was no better a product
than the computer it replaced


661
0:39:39,4 --> 0:39:43,32
but it was packaged and marketed in
a way that became classic Steve Jobs.


662
0:39:43,32 --> 0:39:46,72
It was the sort of packaging
that attracted people


663
0:39:46,72 --> 0:39:49,88
who'd previously had no
interest in computers.


664
0:39:49,88 --> 0:39:53,32
A third of sales were to those
who'd never bought one before.


665
0:39:53,32 --> 0:39:57,56
Who'd have thought you could have an
emotional bond with your computer?


666
0:39:57,56 --> 0:40:2,96
Apple wanted to change people's
relationship with computers.


667
0:40:2,96 --> 0:40:6,32
Steve wanted it to be fashionable but
it was Jonathan who was saying,


668
0:40:6,32 --> 0:40:9,8
"We have to make this
something that people will love."


669
0:40:9,8 --> 0:40:14,36
The word "love" started becoming
part of Apple's motif.


670
0:40:14,36 --> 0:40:18,88
And now there was a new
partnership at the heart of Apple.


671
0:40:18,88 --> 0:40:23,32
Jonathan Ive and Jobs had a very,
very, very special relationship


672
0:40:23,32 --> 0:40:31,48
and it was united by this
almost Zen-like meditative intensity,
which they both have.


673
0:40:31,48 --> 0:40:37,36
Ive's approach to design
would be the new foundation on
which Apple's future would be built.


674
0:40:37,36 --> 0:40:41,24
You've got this incredibly powerful,
this potent technology and people,


675
0:40:41,24 --> 0:40:44,48
and I think design makes
a very sort of important, erm...


676
0:40:44,48 --> 0:40:47,8
..I think, contribution
to the nature of that connection.


677
0:40:47,8 --> 0:40:51,6
I think we're trying to create
products that make sense,


678
0:40:51,6 --> 0:40:56,56
and that people really develop
some sort of affinity with.


679
0:40:56,56 --> 0:40:59,16
They are products that become
personal.


680
0:40:59,16 --> 0:41:4,12
There is a poetic dimension to
some technological artefacts


681
0:41:4,12 --> 0:41:8,88
because they have been crafted into
it, and that is not accidental.


682
0:41:8,88 --> 0:41:14,2
It's absolutely part of a mission,
a focus, and part of the
functionality.


683
0:41:14,2 --> 0:41:17,96
And over the years,
Apple has generally
positioned its products


684
0:41:17,96 --> 0:41:21,68
as expensive,
but oh-so-elegantly designed.


685
0:41:21,68 --> 0:41:26,32
There are people who say,
when you compare the Apple product
with the functional equivalent...


686
0:41:26,32 --> 0:41:29,56
..You see that it's more style
over substance.


687
0:41:29,56 --> 0:41:33,52
No, no, no!
Evan, you couldn't be more wrong.


688
0:41:33,52 --> 0:41:35,28
I wouldn't wish to be rude to you


689
0:41:35,28 --> 0:41:39,4
but it's astonishing to think
that, in the 21st-century,


690
0:41:39,4 --> 0:41:42,76
people still think
there's a distinction
between style and substance,


691
0:41:42,76 --> 0:41:46,4
that the two are not the same.


692
0:41:46,4 --> 0:41:52,64
The better it looks, the more you
want to use it, the more function
you get out of it anyway!


693
0:41:52,64 --> 0:41:57,48
Around the turn-of-the-century,
technology was changing rapidly.


694
0:41:57,48 --> 0:42:1,84
Consumers were rushing to buy
new digital devices
like cameras and music players,


695
0:42:1,84 --> 0:42:7,32
and Jobs saw how Apple could weave
itself deeper into people's lives,


696
0:42:7,32 --> 0:42:10,44
IF it could exploit the trend.


697
0:42:10,44 --> 0:42:16,32
We are living in a new digital
lifestyle with an explosion
of digital devices,


698
0:42:16,32 --> 0:42:24,6
and we believe that the Mac can
become the digital hub of our new
emerging digital lifestyle.


699
0:42:24,6 --> 0:42:28,44
We think this is going to be huge.


700
0:42:28,44 --> 0:42:32,56
Jobs' insight was the beginning
of Apple as we know it today.


701
0:42:32,56 --> 0:42:38,92
Computers were becoming powerful
enough to store and play video,
music and other media.


702
0:42:38,92 --> 0:42:43,8
Apple began working secretly on
a digital device of its own.


703
0:42:43,8 --> 0:42:48,0
It would revolutionise the company
and our increasingly digital world.


704
0:42:48,0 --> 0:42:53,48
The iPod came about because somewhat
of a convergence of technologies.


705
0:42:53,48 --> 0:42:57,52
We learned that we could marry
a really small hard drive -


706
0:42:57,52 --> 0:43:2,2
small in size, large in capacity -
with some small electronics


707
0:43:2,2 --> 0:43:6,28
and build a really good
music player.


708
0:43:6,28 --> 0:43:12,36
Just as with the mouse in the 1980s,
Jobs and Apple did not invent
the MP3 player,


709
0:43:12,36 --> 0:43:16,4
but they did redefine it
for consumers.


710
0:43:16,4 --> 0:43:20,48
The iPod could hold 1,000 songs,


711
0:43:20,48 --> 0:43:24,84
but its real innovation
lay in Jonathan Ive's design.


712
0:43:24,84 --> 0:43:28,36
There were lots of MP3 players
around before the iPod


713
0:43:28,36 --> 0:43:31,64
but they all looked as ugly as car
batteries and it was only Apple


714
0:43:31,64 --> 0:43:36,0
who had the sense to make the
iPod into a gorgeous, gorgeous thing.


715
0:43:36,0 --> 0:43:39,76
The colour of the first iPod
was no accident.


716
0:43:39,76 --> 0:43:44,44
Choosing white for the iPod
wasn't just a Johnny decision,
it was a Johnny and Steve decision.


717
0:43:44,44 --> 0:43:48,6
They really looked into the idea
of the colour white.


718
0:43:48,6 --> 0:43:55,36
It was something, which carried on
a certain spirit and purity.


719
0:43:55,36 --> 0:44:1,24
They went to many, many iterations
of white and had to look at special
materials, special polymers,


720
0:44:1,24 --> 0:44:7,2
to produce and convey and maintain
the certain whiteness of the iPod.


721
0:44:7,2 --> 0:44:9,88
Carefully chosen colours,
white or otherwise,


722
0:44:9,88 --> 0:44:13,68
had a distinctive
presence in the advertising.


723
0:44:13,68 --> 0:44:16,52
And with this product,
unlike some in the past,


724
0:44:16,52 --> 0:44:19,8
Apple was not going to
overestimate demand.


725
0:44:19,8 --> 0:44:24,8
Indeed, quite the reverse.
When we were planning the launch
of the iPod across Europe,


726
0:44:24,8 --> 0:44:26,88
an important thing we had to
manage with the iPod


727
0:44:26,88 --> 0:44:30,64
was to make sure
we kind of undersupplied the demand


728
0:44:30,64 --> 0:44:32,48
so that we'd only roll it out


729
0:44:32,48 --> 0:44:37,4
almost in response to cities crying
out for those iPods to be available


730
0:44:37,4 --> 0:44:41,8
and that's how we kept
that kind of cachet for the iPod
in its early years.


731
0:44:41,8 --> 0:44:45,64
And we'd use extensive data research
to understand


732
0:44:45,64 --> 0:44:50,8
what the kind of relative strength of
doing that in Rome versus Madrid
would be.


733
0:44:50,8 --> 0:44:55,36
Unlike most other MP3 players,
which worked with either
Macs or PCs,


734
0:44:55,36 --> 0:44:59,36
the iPod needed Apple software
running on an Apple computer.


735
0:44:59,36 --> 0:45:4,32
For Steve Jobs, this closed system
seemed to be a virtuous circle.


736
0:45:4,32 --> 0:45:6,28
When they sell iPods
at the beginning,


737
0:45:6,28 --> 0:45:7,92
it locks you into the system,


738
0:45:7,92 --> 0:45:12,2
and iPods have an immediate impact


739
0:45:12,2 --> 0:45:16,8
on Apple Mac sales within the
profitability of the corporation
as a whole.


740
0:45:16,8 --> 0:45:22,68
Ultimately, Jobs realised that Apple
could make even more money
by creating an iPod for Windows.


741
0:45:22,68 --> 0:45:28,2
Steve knew that, for him
to take Apple to another place,


742
0:45:28,2 --> 0:45:30,92
he had to break out of
the Mac ghetto,


743
0:45:30,92 --> 0:45:35,52
which is his gated community
of loyal fans
who love the product.


744
0:45:35,52 --> 0:45:40,0
Music became his way of reaching
that larger audience.


745
0:45:40,0 --> 0:45:44,72
..is the new iPod.
Apple was on a roll.


746
0:45:44,72 --> 0:45:51,16
The iPod quickly became
the number one digital music
player in America and beyond.


747
0:45:51,16 --> 0:45:53,88
You suddenly saw them everywhere,


748
0:45:53,88 --> 0:45:58,32
and its success set
the company on a new course.


749
0:45:58,32 --> 0:46:3,4
There was no vision of
there's going to be an iPod,
then an iPhone, then an iPad.


750
0:46:3,4 --> 0:46:7,84
However, there was a vision that
we're going to be more consumer,


751
0:46:7,84 --> 0:46:15,36
more of a consumer electronics
company.


752
0:46:15,36 --> 0:46:20,2
This is our store, and the store
is divided into four parts.


753
0:46:20,2 --> 0:46:24,56
The first quarter of the store
has our home section...


754
0:46:24,56 --> 0:46:28,4
Apple was on its way to becoming
a global phenomenon.


755
0:46:28,4 --> 0:46:30,64
Wanting to build a consumer
electronics company,


756
0:46:30,64 --> 0:46:35,88
the next step was to go into
consumer electronics stores,
Apple style,


757
0:46:35,88 --> 0:46:41,36
with shops designed to match
the products in them.


758
0:46:41,36 --> 0:46:45,44
What's interesting about Apple's
move into retail


759
0:46:45,44 --> 0:46:47,64
is it wasn't so much Apple
opening up a shop,


760
0:46:47,64 --> 0:46:50,28
but rather Apple opening up
its experience


761
0:46:50,28 --> 0:46:54,56
and allowing people to buy
Apple products in the kind of style,


762
0:46:54,56 --> 0:46:59,24
in the kind of environment, that
actually really suited that brand.


763
0:46:59,24 --> 0:47:3,72
Every facet of the way the stores
look was influenced by Steve Jobs.


764
0:47:3,72 --> 0:47:9,48
He even held the American patent
for the design of the glass stairs.


765
0:47:9,48 --> 0:47:15,2
The fact that Steve Jobs was
a sort of hippy control freak was
an extraordinary collision,


766
0:47:15,2 --> 0:47:18,56
but it's worked absolutely
brilliantly for Apple,


767
0:47:18,56 --> 0:47:23,64
which is you've got this
impression of hippy chic and relaxed
and everything else,


768
0:47:23,64 --> 0:47:29,16
whereas actually this organisation
is one of the most controlled
organisations in the world.


769
0:47:29,16 --> 0:47:33,6
Apple boasts some of the world's
most profitable retail space,


770
0:47:33,6 --> 0:47:36,8
but the shops are about far more
than selling products.


771
0:47:36,8 --> 0:47:40,56
An Apple Store is a temple
to a belief system.


772
0:47:40,56 --> 0:47:44,36
They conform to the structure
of a religion.


773
0:47:44,36 --> 0:47:48,16
They have the objects of veneration,
the phone, the tablet,


774
0:47:48,16 --> 0:47:50,8
they have a powerful priesthood.


775
0:47:50,8 --> 0:47:54,48
They have a congregation of people
who belong and who believe in Apple,


776
0:47:54,48 --> 0:48:1,44
but ultimately they have the Messiah,
the religious leader,
the late Steve Jobs.


777
0:48:1,44 --> 0:48:6,4
Apple's ethos, defined by that
Think Different slogan,


778
0:48:6,4 --> 0:48:9,32
turned out to be a remarkably
valuable business philosophy.


779
0:48:9,32 --> 0:48:13,0
It had helped the company reinvent
computing and retailing,


780
0:48:13,0 --> 0:48:18,0
and next it would take Apple to yet
another revolutionary endeavour.


781
0:48:18,0 --> 0:48:24,8
Steve Jobs was one of those people
who recognised that, in the digital
age, content would be key.


782
0:48:24,8 --> 0:48:27,96
The iPod was designed to be a way
to synchronise your music


783
0:48:27,96 --> 0:48:31,48
from your computer to get it into
your pocket.


784
0:48:31,48 --> 0:48:36,92
It was after the success of the iPod
that Apple said there's
a market for us to sell music,


785
0:48:36,92 --> 0:48:39,76
but that was not the original plan.


786
0:48:39,76 --> 0:48:43,64
While Jobs needed music
for the iPod,


787
0:48:43,64 --> 0:48:46,12
the music industry
had a problem of its own.


788
0:48:46,12 --> 0:48:51,6
The rise of file-sharing websites
like Napster was threatening the way
the industry made money.


789
0:48:51,6 --> 0:48:57,4
So you went from a world in which you
had to go buy stuff in a store


790
0:48:57,4 --> 0:49:0,48
to a world in which you had this
cloud of music


791
0:49:0,48 --> 0:49:5,16
that was, in effect,
an unlimited source of free music,


792
0:49:5,16 --> 0:49:9,68
which was a very threatening idea
to the music industry.


793
0:49:9,68 --> 0:49:13,8
Faced with this crisis, the record
industry had tried to close
Napster down


794
0:49:13,8 --> 0:49:16,96
and sue people
who downloaded music for free.


795
0:49:16,96 --> 0:49:21,44
They were alarmed by Apple's iPod.


796
0:49:21,44 --> 0:49:25,48
The record labels were very unhappy
with that and felt that,


797
0:49:25,48 --> 0:49:29,12
only because Napster was hard to use,
could the music survive,


798
0:49:29,12 --> 0:49:32,4
and here was Apple coming out with
a digital music product


799
0:49:32,4 --> 0:49:35,56
that was easy to use and was
going to make it much more popular.


800
0:49:35,56 --> 0:49:41,16
Even so, some in the music industry
thought Apple might be able to help.


801
0:49:41,16 --> 0:49:46,0
In 2002, a delegation
of music executives travelled
to Apple's headquarters


802
0:49:46,0 --> 0:49:49,4
to present a vision
for how they might collaborate.


803
0:49:49,4 --> 0:49:52,64
Steve Jobs did not exactly warm
to their ideas.


804
0:49:52,64 --> 0:49:56,4
He listens,
but he isn't listening patiently.


805
0:49:56,4 --> 0:50:1,84
At one point he waves his arms
and says, "Stop, stop,
that's not why I'm here.


806
0:50:1,84 --> 0:50:4,76
"I didn't come here to listen to you.


807
0:50:4,76 --> 0:50:8,68
"I have my own views
on what we need to do.


808
0:50:8,68 --> 0:50:12,72
"You guys in the music business
have had your heads up your asses
all these years!"


809
0:50:12,72 --> 0:50:20,32
Which made everybody on my side of
the table mute, silent.


810
0:50:20,32 --> 0:50:25,44
And I said, "Steve, that's exactly
why we're here. We need your help."


811
0:50:25,44 --> 0:50:30,28
Other technology companies
had tried and failed
to persuade the major labels


812
0:50:30,28 --> 0:50:34,8
to license their music online,
but Jobs was different.


813
0:50:34,8 --> 0:50:37,0
Jobs was the biggest share
owner in Disney.


814
0:50:37,0 --> 0:50:40,16
Because he was in such a strong
position as a Hollywood player


815
0:50:40,16 --> 0:50:46,16
that he was able to bang the heads
together of the music companies and
say this is how it's going to be.


816
0:50:46,16 --> 0:50:52,44
To Jobs, it was obvious the record
labels didn't understand
the new internet-savvy consumers.


817
0:50:52,44 --> 0:50:57,64
He insisted the way to beat
file-sharing was not to punish
people for doing it


818
0:50:57,64 --> 0:51:2,2
but to offer a more convenient
reasonably-priced alternative.


819
0:51:2,2 --> 0:51:9,8
In less than a year,
every major label had signed up to
the Apple iTunes store.


820
0:51:9,8 --> 0:51:12,72
He just got the deal done and that
was an incredible achievement.


821
0:51:12,72 --> 0:51:14,84
That in pure business terms
is deal-making,


822
0:51:14,84 --> 0:51:18,84
which is a recognisable
feature of your great tycoon.


823
0:51:18,84 --> 0:51:24,32
In its first week, the iTunes store
sold more than 1 million tracks.


824
0:51:24,32 --> 0:51:27,12
It was so successful by the end
of the first year,


825
0:51:27,12 --> 0:51:32,68
the leverage had shifted from the
owner of the content to Apple.


826
0:51:32,68 --> 0:51:38,24
Some artists believe Apple
now wields too much power
through iTunes,


827
0:51:38,24 --> 0:51:40,36
putting profits before musicians.


828
0:51:40,36 --> 0:51:45,4
..whose works it bleeds
like a digital vampire
for its enormous commission,


829
0:51:45,4 --> 0:51:49,72
that it decides, you know,
we'll take 30%.


830
0:51:49,72 --> 0:51:52,36
It's a bit of a pity that
everyone's online these days.


831
0:51:52,36 --> 0:51:55,8
But you can't blame them.
It's just the modern world, innit?


832
0:51:55,8 --> 0:51:57,24
But what a business it is.


833
0:51:57,24 --> 0:52:2,8
IPods give Apple power
over the music industry
through the connection to iTunes,


834
0:52:2,8 --> 0:52:6,36
and, in turn, the appeal
of iTunes boosts sales of iPods.


835
0:52:6,36 --> 0:52:10,4
If I can fulfil all your needs,
then I'll get all your money,


836
0:52:10,4 --> 0:52:13,48
and that's Steve's approach.


837
0:52:13,48 --> 0:52:19,68
He wanted to give people the devices
they would use to consume video
and audio,


838
0:52:19,68 --> 0:52:23,2
then he wanted to
give them video and audio to consume.


839
0:52:23,2 --> 0:52:28,96
He's created the future
of entertainment.


840
0:52:28,96 --> 0:52:31,76
Jobs was usually very
guarded about his private life,


841
0:52:31,76 --> 0:52:37,44
but in 2005 he chose a very public
stage, a speech to graduating
students,


842
0:52:37,44 --> 0:52:41,8
to reveal he had been battling
serious illness.


843
0:52:41,8 --> 0:52:45,76
About a year ago,
I was diagnosed with cancer.


844
0:52:45,76 --> 0:52:47,84
I had a scan at 7.30 in the morning


845
0:52:47,84 --> 0:52:50,8
and it clearly showed
a tumour on my pancreas.


846
0:52:50,8 --> 0:52:55,32
My doctor advised me to go home
and get my affairs in order,


847
0:52:55,32 --> 0:52:58,6
which is doctor's
code for "prepare to die".


848
0:52:58,6 --> 0:53:4,48
It turned out to be a very rare
form of pancreatic cancer
that is curable with surgery.


849
0:53:4,48 --> 0:53:8,76
I had the surgery
and thankfully I'm fine now.


850
0:53:8,76 --> 0:53:13,32
In reality, Jobs would continue
his struggle with cancer
for the next six years.


851
0:53:13,32 --> 0:53:17,96
His diagnosis had a profound impact.


852
0:53:17,96 --> 0:53:21,72
Death is very likely the single
best invention of life.


853
0:53:21,72 --> 0:53:26,4
It's life's change agent, it clears
out the old to make way for the new.


854
0:53:26,4 --> 0:53:31,48
Your time is limited so don't waste
it living someone else's life.


855
0:53:31,48 --> 0:53:35,52
It's a philosophy that Jobs
himself followed.


856
0:53:35,52 --> 0:53:41,4
It's really amazing in hindsight what
he accomplished while he was sick.


857
0:53:41,4 --> 0:53:44,92
Not only was he fighting this
debilitating disease,


858
0:53:44,92 --> 0:53:49,16
he was leading a huge corporation
doing earth-shaking work


859
0:53:49,16 --> 0:53:52,84
that affects hundreds of millions
of people.


860
0:53:52,84 --> 0:53:57,68
Steve Jobs' next major project
would bring together
everything he stood for,


861
0:53:57,68 --> 0:54:3,76
a bold raid into a market into which
the company had never been a player.


862
0:54:3,76 --> 0:54:6,76
IPod. A phone.


863
0:54:6,76 --> 0:54:8,44
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE


864
0:54:8,44 --> 0:54:10,88
Are you getting it?


865
0:54:10,88 --> 0:54:17,16
It would revolutionise the way
a long-established industry worked,
and make Apple billions.


866
0:54:17,16 --> 0:54:22,28
And we're calling it... iPhone.


867
0:54:22,28 --> 0:54:28,2
He said, "I think that we'll
succeed in this marketplace


868
0:54:28,2 --> 0:54:30,16
"because we're a software company,


869
0:54:30,16 --> 0:54:34,4
"and everyone we're going to compete
with are hardware companies."


870
0:54:34,4 --> 0:54:40,52
I didn't realise at the time
just how profound that was.


871
0:54:40,52 --> 0:54:46,24
Apple's iPhone became the fastest
selling handset on the market.


872
0:54:46,24 --> 0:54:49,36
People weren't buying them
just to make phone calls.


873
0:54:49,36 --> 0:54:51,48
Steve, I love you!


874
0:54:51,48 --> 0:54:56,16
What made the iPhone different
was apps.


875
0:54:56,16 --> 0:55:0,28
The iPhone was the gateway to
a world of downloadable software


876
0:55:0,28 --> 0:55:5,96
for anything from shopping
to finding love, or lust, nearby.


877
0:55:5,96 --> 0:55:10,48
He came into the marketplace
and absolutely demonstrated to people


878
0:55:10,48 --> 0:55:15,36
how you could package up bits of the
internet and present it to people


879
0:55:15,36 --> 0:55:22,0
in a way that was really simple
and fast and digestible
in the form of apps.


880
0:55:22,0 --> 0:55:26,52
With apps, Apple had worked out how
to open up its closed system


881
0:55:26,52 --> 0:55:31,12
just enough to keep earning
money from its latest iPods,
iPhones and iPads,


882
0:55:31,12 --> 0:55:38,8
even after you've bought them.
The money keeps rolling in.


883
0:55:38,8 --> 0:55:40,44
For the first time ever,


884
0:55:40,44 --> 0:55:44,64
Apple briefly topped Exxon Mobil
as the world's most valuable company.


885
0:55:44,64 --> 0:55:50,0
All the more amazing as android
phones and Dell and HP computers
outsell Apple.


886
0:55:50,0 --> 0:55:52,76
Oddly enough, the market share of
Apple is very low.


887
0:55:52,76 --> 0:55:57,4
It's incredibly low in computers but
they make enormous profit out of it.


888
0:55:57,4 --> 0:56:1,0
It's actually low in smartphones.
It's not the leader in the world


889
0:56:1,0 --> 0:56:5,32
by any means, yet the money they make
make them the largest company
on Earth.


890
0:56:5,32 --> 0:56:8,84
Apple is much stronger
than its competition,


891
0:56:8,84 --> 0:56:15,2
and so they need to make sure
they don't get complacent


892
0:56:15,2 --> 0:56:21,48
because the way they'll lose
some day is when someone
quietly comes up behind them


893
0:56:21,48 --> 0:56:24,52
and does something
that is now better.


894
0:56:24,52 --> 0:56:27,16
Over the course of more than
three decades,


895
0:56:27,16 --> 0:56:31,64
some might argue that Apple has
travelled far from its origins,


896
0:56:31,64 --> 0:56:38,4
as a bunch of Californians
railing against IBM to become,
itself, an all-powerful Big Brother.


897
0:56:38,4 --> 0:56:41,4
But it is a more complicated
and interesting story.


898
0:56:41,4 --> 0:56:45,44
If Steve Jobs had just been a rebel,
he wouldn't have got far,


899
0:56:45,44 --> 0:56:48,16
but it's because he always had
that inner-hippy


900
0:56:48,16 --> 0:56:53,16
that Apple became so much more than
just another computer company.


901
0:56:53,16 --> 0:56:57,96
There was one aspect of Steve Jobs'
battle with cancer
he hadn't revealed.


902
0:56:57,96 --> 0:57:1,64
He'd delayed having surgery for
nine months after he was diagnosed.


903
0:57:1,64 --> 0:57:4,72
Instead he'd tried
alternative remedies


904
0:57:4,72 --> 0:57:9,8
and a strict vegan diet, against
the advice of those closest to him.


905
0:57:9,8 --> 0:57:11,72
And the cancer had spread.


906
0:57:11,72 --> 0:57:15,76
He was the kind of person that could
convince himself of things


907
0:57:15,76 --> 0:57:20,8
that weren't necessarily true,
and that always worked with him
for designing products,


908
0:57:20,8 --> 0:57:25,4
where he could go to people
and ask them to do something
that they thought was impossible.


909
0:57:25,4 --> 0:57:29,12
And I think he truly thought that,


910
0:57:29,12 --> 0:57:35,8
through some unconventional means,
he could cure himself.


911
0:57:35,8 --> 0:57:38,76
A Californian suburb.


912
0:57:38,76 --> 0:57:45,32
This was Steve Jobs' house
after his death at the age of 56.


913
0:57:45,32 --> 0:57:50,28
Home to no ordinary CEO,
billionaire or hippie.


914
0:57:50,28 --> 0:57:53,28
# Buckets or rain, buckets of tears


915
0:57:53,28 --> 0:57:56,12
# Got all them buckets
coming out of my ears


916
0:57:56,12 --> 0:57:59,76
# Buckets of moonbeams
in my hand... #


917
0:57:59,76 --> 0:58:2,0
He wasn't an inventor,
he wasn't a code writer,


918
0:58:2,0 --> 0:58:6,8
he wasn't a designer,
he wasn't a businessman really.


919
0:58:6,8 --> 0:58:8,8
I mean the word people use
is visionary.


920
0:58:8,8 --> 0:58:12,0
If you break it down in the sense
of he saw things,


921
0:58:12,0 --> 0:58:16,16
in that sense he was a visionary.
He just saw things.


922
0:58:16,16 --> 0:58:21,8
As near as I can tell, Steve Jobs
never left his counter-cultural
frame of reference,


923
0:58:21,8 --> 0:58:26,6
and so his way of staying forever
young was to stay forever hippy.


924
0:58:26,6 --> 0:58:31,28
Stay hungry, stay foolish.
Thank you all very much.


925
0:58:31,28 --> 0:58:32,76
APPLAUSE
