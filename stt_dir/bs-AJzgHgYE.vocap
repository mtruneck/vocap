###10 <i> Narrator: On this  episode of Wicked Tuna.</i>
###12 Dave: And he's gonna (bleep) us.
###13 Paul: He's used to being the number one boat.
###16 Kevin: There's only room for one Number One in this
###18 group.
###18 Dave: I want to be on top.
###20 Paul: It was like someone (bleep) flicked a switch.
###23 Dave: (Bleep) them, (bleep) them all.
###25 Kevin: I know he's a little jealous right now.
###27 Dave's been humbled.
###29 Humbled and hobbled.
###30 Dave: I want the (bleep) biggest one in the fleet
###31 this year.
###32 Marciano: Holy (bleep).
###34 Bill: Oh, my God.
###35 He's right under the boat.
###36 Marciano: Any rod can go any minute.
###38 Scott: It's all right, I'll play this game all night.
###40 That's huge.
###41 This is a monster.
###42 Paul: The biggest one, ever.
###45 Kevin: Oh, my god.
###46 <i> Narrator: Fishing  is a hard life.</i>
###48 Ralph: There's gonna be confrontation.
###50 <i> Narrator: And harder with  bluefin stocks depleted.</i>
###52 <i> In Gloucester,  Massachusetts,</i>
###53 <i> there's a special  breed of fisherman.</i>
###55 <i> For generations, they've  used rod and reel to catch</i>
###58 <i> the elusive bluefin tuna.</i>
###60 Jay: Yeah, baby!
###61 <i> Narrator: They depend  on these fish for their</i>
###62 <i> survival.</i>
###63 <i> The competition is brutal.</i>
###65 Scott: You miserable prick.
###66 <i> Narrator: This  is Wicked Tuna.</i>
###76 Dave: It's great to be on top.
###77 It's great to make all the money.
###78 But with that, nobody likes a winner.
###80 Marciano: For me the money doesn't fall out of the sky,
###83 it comes out of the sea.
###85 Bill: This gets harder as you get older.
###86 But I'm keeping up with the young guns.
###88 Get out of the way!
###89 Ralph: If it's on my mind you're gonna hear about it.
###90 And if you did something to me,
###92 I'm gonna do something back to you.
###105 Dave: Sandro, keep throwing 'em.
###106 You keep doing your job, buddy.
###108 Come on, we got the fish here.
###109 Paul: Still there.
###110 Two of 'em right now.
###111 Dave: Keep it on.
###112 Keep it, I like it, gets them frenzied up.
###113 You know what you're seeing right now on the Tuna.com?
###115 Three good fishermen at the top of their game,
###117 catching fish and kicking ass.
###118 Two of 'em right now under the boat.
###120 All big (bleep) chum feeding fish.
###124 One of us, sometimes two of us, sometimes three of us,
###126 are always in the back of that boat working non-stop.
###129 And that's what we do, work hard and catch fish.
###132 So we got a bite the other day, right there.
###136 Paul: They're coming in hot right now.
###137 They're hot.
###137 Dave: They're hot.
###140 I'm gonna get him in.
###142 Here we go.
###150 Bill: Alright, Charlie.
###152 You have avoided me long enough.
###154 It's time to jump on and go for a ride.
###157 This year, we are pretty much in the hole.
###160 You know it's getting late in the season now.
###162 You still have to catch them.
###167 Come on.
###167 Say some prayers, do something.
###169 Do a voodoo or do something good.
###172 There you go.
###173 Now you're talking.
###175 I'm telling you, they're coming.
###177 You watch.
###189 Kevin: We're gonna go kill one here shortly.
###191 I grew up fishing.
###192 I was one of those kids that, uh, you know,
###194 I'd skip school and grab a, a trout rod and sneak down
###197 to the lake.
###198 I caught my first giant when I was 18.
###199 Once I caught that first big fish, I, I was hooked.
###203 It, obviously, it's fun.
###204 It's a challenge.
###205 But it's all about the money.
###209 Sandro: What's he doing?
###210 What the hell, what's he doing right there?
###211 Dave: Anchored.
###211 Sandro: Right there?
###212 Dave: He's, yeah.
###213 I don't know why he's not in his other spot.
###214 Kevin anchored way too (bleep) close.
###216 We steam out of Gloucester Harbor.
###218 We're fishing.
###219 An hour goes by.
###221 And we look out the window, and see this boat steaming
###223 right at us and, uh, I realize its Kevin on the
###226 Christina.
###226 He's been around a long time.
###227 He's a very experienced fisherman.
###229 He knows better than to anchor that close.
###230 And he's gonna (bleep) us.
###232 He's gonna saw us right off and our day is gonna be
###233 over.
###234 And there's no reason for him to be sitting right on
###235 top of our anchor.
###236 He knows I've been catching fish there every day.
###238 So he wanted to be close to us because we were
###240 definitely pulling up quite a few fish out of there.
###243 Now he's gonna hook up and he's gonna (bleep) go right
###245 through our anchor.
###246 Paul: Of course.
###248 Sandro: I can't believe he's setting up right there.
###249 Dave: I don't understand that.
###252 And if he hooks up he's gonna say, "Dave,
###253 you gotta get off your anchor."
###254 And we're gonna miss the bite.
###255 Paul: Uh-huh.
###256 Kevin: Dave's got this thing.
###258 If anybody anchors within a mile of the Dot Com,
###261 he goes, he comes unglued.
###263 Unglued.
###264 So I said, "You know what?
###266 I'm gonna torture him a little bit today."
###268 Shut my radio off.
###269 And I anchored right on top of him.
###272 His theory is, everybody knows Dave's catching fish,
###275 so they all want to anchor on top of him.
###277 For me, I just anchored on top of him to torture him.
###284 Dave: Kevin, keep in mind, you're pretty close to my
###285 anchor right off the port.
###289 You copy?
###293 Because he anchored up so close to us,
###295 if he hooks up and makes us get off the anchor,
###297 I'm gonna be (bleep) furious.
###303 Kevin: He'll be beatin' himself against the side of
###304 the boat.
###306 Sammy: That is a weird looking boat.
###307 Kevin: It is a weird looking boat.
###310 He was pointing at us a minute ago.
###313 Dot Com coming unglued.
###318 Dave's been on top for a while.
###319 But it's definitely all gonna change.
###321 Somebody's gonna catch one bigger than his.
###332 Marciano: On the starboard side,
###333 we got Dave in the Tuna.com.
###335 On the port side, we got Kevin on the Christina.
###338 And then on the port side of Kevin,
###341 we have Bounty Hunter.
###342 We're all right in a row here.
###344 These guys have been seeing fish.
###347 We're gonna see if we can snag one right out from in
###349 between them all.
###357 Paul: We got one in the chum at 35 feet, Dave.
###359 Dave: All right.
###360 Paul: Dude, look how long he is.
###363 Sandro: He is (bleep) long, dude.
###364 Holy (bleep).
###366 Paul: Look at how big he is, Dave!
###368 Dave: Is it really?
###369 Holy (bleep).
###371 Paul: Oh, Dave, right here.
###372 These fish are eating chum.
###374 Dave: I'm gonna get him in.
###381 Bill: Oh, my God, he's right under the boat, yeah,
###383 a big fish, though.
###384 Real big.
###385 Donna: Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on,
###386 come on.
###387 Bill: How far up?
###388 Scott: He came up to a hundred feet.
###390 Bill: Here he comes.
###391 Come on baby, come on.
###392 Come on.
###396 Donna: Come on.
###398 Bill: 50 feet.
###400 Here he comes.
###406 Marciano: There we go.
###408 He's coming to life now.
###409 Let's see holy (bleep), that's a big one, Jay.
###415 Jay: Get your rig on, I'll put this guy down.
###418 Marciano: I'll be damned if I'm gonna let somebody else
###419 land this fish.
###422 Jay: 10!
###424 That's a big one.
###428 Marciano: Come on, baby, you're all mine.
###432 Blair: Ah, that's a big one.
###434 There he is.
###435 He's turning.
###436 Kevin: There he is.
###437 Oh.
###438 I'm looking at the fish finder, Sammy.
###439 He's right up in the chum.
###441 He's, I know he's big.
###471 We're on, we're on.
###472 Scott, you take the rod.
###473 I'm on the wheel.
###474 Get out of my way.
###478 Blair: Real tight, real tight.
###480 Scott: Easy.
###481 Kevin: Come on, stay with him.
###482 Stay with him.
###483 Come on.
###484 Blair: He's coming.
###485 All right, take it easy.
###486 Take it easy.
###487 Kevin: That fish took the line right out of Scott's
###489 hands, and we hooked up.
###492 Come on, come on, stay on him.
###493 He's taking line, guys.
###495 Scott: Jesus, Kevin, he's pulling hard.
###496 Kevin: Make it crank.
###497 There you go.
###502 He's pulling away from us.
###505 Scott: Easy, easy.
###509 Kevin: He took off, and he kept going.
###511 Scott: Forward!
###512 Forward!
###512 Kevin: And he burned rubber.
###514 Scott: Okay, back up, back up, back up.
###522 Kevin: Just put some good pressure on him.
###526 Take him now.
###527 Scott: Hold on, I can't see him well enough.
###530 Yeah, he's coming around, he's on his side.
###535 Kevin: I can see him on the fish finder.
###537 So we're slowly gaining on him.
###541 If we get him up to 50 feet or so, he'd see the boat,
###544 he'd go right back to the bottom.
###548 Blair: Oh, no.
###549 Kevin: He still there?
###550 Scott: I don't think so, hold on.
###555 Yeah, he's there.
###556 He's there.
###557 Blair: Yep, he's circling.
###558 Scott: Move forward just a little bit.
###560 Kevin: So we're slowly gaining on him.
###562 And you're looking down on the water, I'm like, "Jeez,
###564 this is a big fish."
###566 Blair: He's coming around.
###567 Stop.
###568 Under the boat.
###570 Don't, leave it in neutral.
###571 Swivel's coming.
###572 Under the boat.
###575 Get ready for the reverse, Kev.
###577 Kevin: I don't like that.
###577 Scott: I don't either.
###578 Blair: Forward, forward, forward.
###579 Scott: Hold on.
###581 Man: He's on this side.
###583 There he is, he's up on top, he's coming down.
###585 He's coming right at us.
###586 Yep, he's still there.
###588 He's coming up, he's coming up,
###589 just come back a little bit.
###591 He's coming up.
###593 You gotta blast him.
###594 Blair: Alright, alright, alright, bring him up.
###595 Scott: He's coming up, he's coming up.
###597 Coming up, coming, coming, coming.
###600 Kevin: Ready to let go?
###600 Scott: No Kevin, no?
###602 Scott: There he is.
###603 Kevin: This is a monster.
###604 Oh my God.
###614 Kevin: Still going?
###615 Scott: Yep.
###616 It's all right, I'll play this game all night.
###618 Kevin: He started circling, under the boat,
###620 like he knew what to do.
###621 He was trying to cut himself off.
###624 Probably a 30 year old fish.
###626 It's not his first rodeo, he had been hooked before.
###630 Scott: He just took back everything I grabbed.
###632 Blair: Pure power right there.
###635 Kevin: Still going?
###636 I can't let him go under the boat.
###638 He wasn't ready to die.
###640 Take him now.
###647 Got him.
###648 Scott: Come on, get the tail rope.
###649 Get the tail rope.
###652 Kevin: He's pulling away from us.
###661 Man: Put it in reverse, reverse.
###664 Come on, pull it ahead.
###668 Kevin: Got him.
###669 That is a beast, my boys.
###671 Scott: Where'd you come from?
###672 Kevin: Whoo!
###673 All right.
###675 Scott: That's above average, Rich.
###676 Kevin: That's why we do this.
###678 Blair: That is gonna be all of 900 pounds.
###680 Kevin: That's my grander right there.
###682 I gotta give you a hug.
###684 Whoo hoo.
###685 Scott: Let's get him in the boat.
###687 Kevin: We open the door and we slid him in.
###690 Pull.
###691 Pull!
###693 (Bleep), look at that boy!
###698 And we were all in awe.
###700 I said, this is the biggest one I've ever caught.
###702 Ohh!
###705 I think we need a bigger boat.
###707 If anybody was to catch that, it's a trophy.
###710 I'm gonna call it an eleven hundred pound fish.
###712 This is gonna cash in between 10 and 15 grand.
###717 That's all that it's all about, the big fish.
###718 You know, people talk about the glorious and the big
###721 ones.
###722 You know, it's not in the numbers.
###727 Dave: Come in.
###728 You guys there?
###731 Hey, where you guys at?
###732 Come in.
###735 They're not answering.
###736 Bill: It was a big boy.
###737 It was jumbo.
###739 And, uh, we couldn't time it just right.
###742 Hey, good going.
###744 Big one?
###746 Kevin: Oh yeah, she's a beast.
###748 A thousand pounds at least.
###750 Bill: Woo.
###751 Awesome.
###752 Real good.
###753 Good going.
###754 Donna: Good job, Kevin.
###755 Kevin: Thanks a lot, Bill.
###757 Bill: Yeah, we had him here a minute ago and, uh,
###759 couldn't get him hooked.
###760 Pretty big, pretty big mark too, you know.
###763 Kevin: Yeah, we had this guy up to the boat like two or
###765 three times then he'd just go right to the bottom.
###768 We were getting ready to leave and dumped a bunch of
###770 chum and he showed up.
###772 Dave: Come in.
###773 You guys there?
###776 Bill: Good going, Kevin.
###777 At least it wasn't Dave.
###781 Dave: He still ain't gonna answer.
###782 I give up.
###788 Marciano: Kevin, that guy in the Christina, yeah,
###790 that guy.
###793 You know we heard he had an eleven hundred pound fish.
###796 On the one hand, it's like good for Kevin.
###798 But on the other hand, you know,
###800 that's a bigger fish than we've caught in this season.
###803 We're still in the game.
###805 We know how to catch twelve hundred pounders,
###807 and we're gonna do one today.
###814 Dave: Hey, you there, Kevin?
###816 Kevin: Yo.
###816 Come in.
###817 Dave: How was it?
###819 How big was he?
###820 Kevin: Ah, he's in the boat.
###823 118 inches.
###824 Paul: Nice.
###825 Dave: That's a nice 118 inches.
###827 That's.
###828 Paul: That's a big fish, dude.
###828 Dave: That's a big fish there.
###830 Paul: That's as long as the stern, dude.
###832 Dave: 118 inches is a big fish.
###835 Paul: 10 feet long.
###837 Dave: That's a big boy.
###839 I'd like to see a couple more of those.
###840 Good for him.
###843 Good for him.
###845 Paul: He was (bleep) beside himself.
###847 We were very envious of him.
###848 That was a big (bleep).
###858 Rick: That is the biggest fish that we've seen all
###860 year.
###861 That's huge.
###862 Kevin: I've fished with Blair for probably 20 years,
###865 and we both gave the nod.
###867 We knew it, we knew it was, this was a slammer.
###870 He made a turn, came by the boat, and we, we all said,
###873 "Holy (bleep)," and it's something that we've fished
###878 our whole lives to catch a fish of that, of that size.
###882 Rick: Far and few of these fish come across the boards.
###885 And we're looking at a, you know, a 15,000
###887 dollar fish right now.
###888 15,000, 18,000 dollar fish.
###890 That's.
###891 Kevin: It's like catching three, right?
###892 Rick: Right, it's like catching three.
###893 A sizable fish like this, and the beauty and the
###896 quality of this fish, I, I feel that you can do real
###898 well.
###899 Think you'll really raise the bar at the auction.
###901 This, this, this is a fish that we certainly want to
###903 get to Tokyo as soon as possible.
###907 Bill: Oh, yeah, that's a big boy.
###911 Ohh!
###912 Donna: Ooh, hoo, hoo.
###913 Nice job, Kev!
###921 That was worth waiting for, Kev.
###924 Rick: It's a thousand pound fish.
###926 Biggest fish I've seen all year.
###929 Sammy: Big fish, with a little hook.
###931 I told these guys earlier in the day,
###933 "Elephants eat peanuts."
###937 Man: Okay.
###938 Easy.
###940 This is just gonna fit.
###944 Rick: Kevin, congratulations.
###945 That's the biggest fish of the year, dressed weight,
###947 here at Compass Seafood.
###949 Great job.
###949 Great job.
###950 Man: Biggest by 400 pounds.
###954 Rick: Word will travel real quick about this fish being
###956 landed tonight throughout town and it'll get everyone
###958 hot and hungry again, to go back out and try to catch
###960 one of these giants.
###963 Kevin: All right.
###964 I'll buy.
###965 Who flies?
###970 Dave: We're just gonna spend the night here.
###971 It's such a perfect night.
###972 Winds are five knots, so the radar running for the night.
###976 I'll fish a couple more hours anyway,
###977 and wrap it up, and, uh, wait for sunup.
###980 That's the game plan.
###982 Paul: Now, Dave is obsessed with beating Kevin.
###985 It was like someone (bleep) flicked a switch.
###988 He turned into this (bleep) crazed (bleep) robot.
###992 Dave: Oh, we gotta catch a (bleep) fish.
###994 Paul: He was like, "I don't even want an 800-pounder.
###997 I want a 1.200-pounder or I don't even want one."
###1000 Dave: We're long overdue, it's, uh, it's time.
###1003 It's time for it to happen for us.
###1004 Hopefully, tomorrow will be the day.
###1020 Dave: Out here in day two.
###1022 Just got word from Kevin his fish was 1,075 pounds.
###1027 That's a, that's a big ass fish,
###1028 that's all I could say about that.
###1030 Paul: Dave wants to get a bigger fish than Kevin.
###1032 He couldn't even sleep.
###1033 And then when we get up, he was (bleep) exhausted,
###1036 'cause he stayed awake all that night.
###1042 Dave: Definitely under pressure to get one today
###1043 after Kevin got that one.
###1044 Can't come home empty handed now,
###1046 he'll be rubbing it in my face.
###1047 Paul: It was really hard for Dave 'cause he's used to
###1050 being the number one boat.
###1052 And now Kevin got this thousand fifty pounder,
###1057 and it just made him twitch.
###1059 I made him freak out.
###1061 Dave: All I know is I want to get the biggest fish out
###1063 of this group this year.
###1065 Paul: We just need 'em to make a mistake.
###1067 Dave: (Bleep) them, (bleep) them all.
###1069 Everybody's giving me (bleep),
###1071 but I want the (bleep) biggest one in the fleet
###1072 this year.
###1074 And we're gonna (bleep) get him.
###1075 Paul: That was cool to see him amped up like that.
###1079 That's what you want.
###1080 You want the guy that's running the boat to (bleep)
###1084 be amped up like that.
###1085 You want to give him a kick in the (bleep).
###1087 Dave: I want to be on top.
###1090 And we're gonna (bleep) get him.
###1096 Marciano: All we've been doing at this point is
###1097 surviving this season.
###1098 We keep, we get a few, and then we fish for a while and
###1100 don't get more.
###1102 We get a few and then we don't that's just survival
###1104 mode for us.
###1105 We're not really getting ahead at that level.
###1107 What really needs to happen is we need to go right back
###1110 out there now after landing, and keep catching those
###1113 fish.
###1114 And that's how I get ahead of the game.
###1117 Steve: You got a, a charter this weekend, Dave, or?
###1119 Marciano: Yeah, the, the last one coming up for the
###1121 season, yeah.
###1123 We'll take the, uh, little bit of extra bling.
###1125 Come on, it's like a kid in a candy store here, right?
###1128 I keep wandering around.
###1130 My wife hates it when I go here.
###1131 You know, I finally get desperate.
###1133 I finally agree to do a few charters.
###1135 You guys want to go fishing?
###1137 Put, put some money in my hand?
###1139 I'll take you out fishing for the day.
###1141 Okay.
###1144 Steve: We'll worry about the tab later and we'll just
###1145 take care of this, then?
###1146 Marciano: Yeah, all right.
###1148 Steve: 18 once, twice.
###1150 11.
###1151 19, nine, nine, 10 once.
###1156 10 twice.
###1158 Marciano: Here's the painful part.
###1159 Steve: $117.94.
###1161 Marciano: Remember,
###1162 if my wife stops in, I only spent 17.
###1164 Steve: I think, sure, wanna pay her tab?
###1166 Marciano: Oh, man, come on.
###1168 You're killing me.
###1169 What is her tab?
###1171 Steve: It's $487.50.
###1173 Marciano: Who, wha-, what?
###1176 Steve: Four hundred and eighty seven dollars and
###1177 fifty cents.
###1178 Just, 487's good for me, buddy.
###1181 Marciano: That's it.
###1182 You get it all.
###1183 Steve: I get it all, huh?
###1183 Marciano: I get nothing.
###1184 Steve: Thanks, buddy.
###1185 Marciano: I get receipts.
###1186 And I thought tuna fishing was expensive.
###1207 Kevin: Dave and myself are very competitive.
###1212 I know he's a little jealous right now.
###1214 He's been humbled.
###1215 Humbled and hobbled.
###1217 There's not a day in my life with Dave that we don't
###1219 compete one way or another.
###1221 Size matters.
###1229 Sandro: The (bleep) you gotta do to catch tuna.
###1231 It's ridiculous.
###1232 Paul: That's right.
###1234 Dave: Now we're gonna pretty much,
###1235 pretty much kind of fish the same way today as we did
###1237 yesterday and all the other days.
###1238 Only nothing, nothing different.
###1240 You just got to be in the right place at the right
###1241 time, and have the right fish here, that's all.
###1243 Paul: Hopefully we can get lucky.
###1245 Dave: Exactly.
###1247 Kevin had a beauty, no doubt about it.
###1249 Paul: The biggest one ever.
###1252 Dave: That's his, that's his biggest fish, for sure.
###1254 Paul: I haven't caught a (bleep) eleven hundred
###1256 pounder in 25 years.
###1260 I haven't caught a thousand pounder in 20 years.
###1264 Dave: Hey, you there, Kev?
###1265 Kevin: Yeah, come in.
###1266 Dave: That thing had to be fat as, fat as it was, uh,
###1269 as long.
###1271 Kevin: Could barely, barely fit through the door.
###1273 Dave: Really?
###1274 Yeah, it's gonna be a few years before you beat that
###1275 one.
###1277 That was your first, first grander plus, in 27 years.
###1281 Sandro, his first fish, was eleven hundred.
###1285 Kevin: Unbelievable.
###1287 Dave: All right, well, I'm gonna go back to work.
###1289 Kevin: Hey, hey.
###1290 Dave: I was just saying to Kevin,
###1291 it took him 27 years to catch his first
###1293 1,000-pounder.
###1294 Sandro comes out with me on his,
###1297 one of his first maiden voyages on this boat and,
###1299 uh, his first giant tuna was eleven hundred pounds.
###1302 So, quite a big disparity.
###1304 27 years to catch the first one and Sandro catches one
###1308 eleven hundred pounds the first day.
###1311 Yeah, man, I want a bigger one now than I have all year
###1314 because Kevin got one.
###1318 Kevin: So the drama continues.
###1321 Davy.
###1323 There's a lot of jealousy.
###1325 I mean, that's the bottom line.
###1326 If you're catching fish, and the other guy isn't,
###1330 he can't help but be jealous.
###1332 Dave is absolutely sour.
###1334 Scott: Beside himself.
###1335 Kevin: About not having a bigger fish than us.
###1338 Size matters, Davy boy.
###1342 Kevin: He didn't break the thousand mark this year.
###1346 And we got one.
###1348 Yeah, you still there Dave?
###1350 Come in.
###1353 Dave: Well yeah, only did see on fish there and that
###1356 was at, uh, first light.
###1358 And that was it.
###1359 Marciano: We were sitting there at prime time and
###1362 we're hoping them big, fat slobs come back through and
###1364 cooperate.
###1366 Dave: Got to do something.
###1367 I'm getting kind of burned out just (bleep) sitting in
###1369 one spot.
###1370 Nothing happening, you know?
###1372 Should be doing better than this.
###1373 Marciano: Yeah, yeah.
###1375 Yeah, I hear you.
###1376 Dave: Oh, man.
###1377 Well, I'm gonna fish through this tide here.
###1380 I'll be out of here shortly thereafter.
###1382 Good luck.
###1383 I'll chat with you in a few minutes.
###1384 Marciano: Standing by.
###1386 Kevin gets lucky, gets a wicked slob, (bleep) yeah,
###1389 I want to catch a bigger fish than him.
###1397 All right, so we got Davy Dot Com up ahead of us.
###1401 Now, Wilson, I want you to be paying attention up here
###1404 while I'm back there getting these rigs out,
###1406 make damn sure you let me know if you start to see a
###1408 few fish.
###1411 It's gonna hurt him a lot more than it's gonna hurt
###1413 me.
###1418 There's a bunch of fish here.
###1419 Any rod could go any minute.
###1425 There he is.
###1426 We're on!
###1432 We definitely got a tuna fish on the line here.
###1435 Let's just hope he makes the grade to be a sellable fish.
###1438 The legal limit is 73 inches or greater.
###1446 Let me have a good look at you, son.
###1450 He's awful close.
###1456 Nah, he's not a keeper.
###1460 Right species.
###1461 Wrong size.
###1464 Gonna do a quick release job here.
###1469 There he is.
###1470 You know?
###1471 So that's it.
###1472 We got a short.
###1473 Again, not what we're here to target.
###1475 But, uh, it would be illegal for me to sell that fish.
###1478 He's too short.
###1479 The legal limit for a giant bluefin tuna is 73 inches or
###1483 greater.
###1484 That fish there falls into the, uh,
###1487 small medium bluefin tuna category.
###1491 Jay: You know, it's a disappointment;
###1491 no meat for the boat.
###1493 But, uh, at least we know the tuna are biting.
###1497 Just not the big tuna.
###1500 Marciano: Well we just (bleep) haven't been having
###1501 a good year.
###1502 I (bleep) pissing money away,
###1505 (bleep) hand over fist.
###1508 It just, you know, this has been the worst (bleep)
###1510 season I've ever (bleep) had doing this.
###1514 Jay: Yeah.
###1514 Right now it just sucks.
###1515 It feels like we can't do anything right.
###1518 Enough is enough.
###1520 Captain decides to go home.
###1522 You know, we're gonna come out tomorrow and put the
###1523 hooks back in the water and hopefully,
###1526 we can get that right bite.
###1527 Get that week's check.
###1529 You know?
###1530 Get that thousand pounder, hopefully.
###1532 The Hard Merchandise will be on the fish.
###1547 Dave: Good morning.
###1549 Sandro: Yo.
###1550 Dave: Yeah, let's get out of here quick.
###1551 Uh, catch a couple fish hopefully, and,
###1554 we got to beat Kevin.
###1555 Sandro: Be the biggest fin.
###1556 Dave: You ready?
###1557 Sandro: Let's get it done.
###1558 Dave: Come on.
###1559 One big jumbo today.
###1560 Sandro: Yeah, right.
###1561 Dave: 1,038 whatever it is.
###1562 Sandro: Thousand thirty-eight.
###1564 Paul: And you know what Kevin?
###1565 Back the (bleep) up.
###1567 Here we come.
###1577 Jay: Who wants a nice gourmet breakfast?
###1580 Anybody up for a gourmet breakfast?
###1583 Man: Yeah, I'd love one, yeah, yeah.
###1584 Marciano: The season wasn't going well.
###1585 I had to do something.
###1586 So I had an opportunity to grab this charter.
###1589 Jay: Remember, nice and slow so you don't rip it out of
###1591 his mouth.
###1593 Marciano: The whole idea of a charter is these guys are
###1595 hiring me for the opportunity to come out and
###1598 catch a few fish.
###1600 It's not something I normally do.
###1602 Call me a slut, but they offered me money for me to
###1605 take 'em out fishing.
###1606 I'll do what I got to do.
###1608 Yeah, you can whip a few flounders up there,
###1609 though white side up.
###1613 Man: Like that?
###1614 Marciano: Yeah.
###1615 And then we'll do these flounders first,
###1616 and then I'll do the cod.
###1618 You know, it's nice to have the charter.
###1619 Its guaranteed income.
###1621 Especially when tuna fishing's slow.
###1623 But then sometimes it's a little frustrating 'cause
###1625 that pulls me away from the tuna game,
###1627 right during prime time.
###1629 You know, guys are looking to catch some good eatin'
###1631 fish for supper.
###1633 You know?
###1634 We have these beautiful cod and haddock up here in New
###1635 England.
###1637 It's usually pretty easy to go out and get a handful of
###1639 cod and make these guys happy.
###1641 Jay: What we got here, we got some nice big clams.
###1646 You got to make sure your baits got that black gook
###1649 the haddock and cod and pollock they like to suck on
###1651 that.
###1653 The more nastier it is, the faster it's gonna work,
###1656 and the faster you're gonna hook that little fish.
###1659 Marciano: I desperately need this trip.
###1661 This will give me a paycheck and Jay a paycheck to keep
###1663 us in the tuna game a little bit longer.
###1671 Dave: There'll be a bit here in the next few days.
###1672 Do you think so, Paul?
###1674 Paul: I hope so.
###1675 I hope it's this afternoon will determine what's going
###1677 on.
###1680 The last few days have really been bad luck.
###1682 But, it happens.
###1685 Sandro: I would love an 800 pounder.
###1687 Paul: Could, there's always that chance,
###1688 we've done really good here this year.
###1691 Dave: We're gonna stay until dark,
###1692 I don't care how hard it blows.
###1693 Especially with Kevin getting that fish.
###1696 It's imperative we come home with something, anyway.
###1698 I'm getting a little burned out.
###1700 Getting a little burned out to say the least.
###1703 Paul: Yep.
###1704 Dave: Man, I'd love to see something happen here,
###1705 I really would.
###1707 We caught a lot of fish here this year.
###1710 But it's not happening right now.
###1713 We'll blame it on Sandro.
###1715 Paul: Yep.
###1715 Just (bleep) everything up.
###1717 Dave: It's all his fault.
###1717 Right, Sandro?
###1719 Sandro: (Bleep).
###1720 Paul: Aah.
###1721 Dave: Look, aah, you can't.
###1722 Paul: He can't even hold his, chum.
###1725 Paul: You got one?
###1726 Dave: You got one?
###1727 Crank it.
###1728 Something's on there.
###1728 Paul: Something's going.
###1729 You got him; don't let him slack out.
###1730 Dave: Crank, that's tuna coming up.
###1732 Paul: Yep.
###1732 That's a tuna.
###1736 Dave: It's what it's all about.
###1737 Paul: Keep him tight there, rookie.
###1739 Dave: Crank, crank.
###1742 Come on.
###1744 Always want to stay ahead of the competition.
###1746 Just by one.
###1748 We're on the cliff, right Sandro?
###1749 Sandro: Yeah.
###1750 Bend that rod.
###1752 This is what it's all about again.
###1755 Crank, crank, come on.
###1757 The competition continues.
###1759 Sandro, stay on him.
###1760 Stay on him.
###1761 Here he comes.
###1762 I almost got color.
###1764 Grab that rope?
###1765 Dave: Yeah, bitch.
###1766 Aah, looks small, maybe a small tuna.
###1769 Small tuna or bluedog.
###1770 Paul: I don't know; a seven hundred pounder does the
###1771 same thing.
###1773 Dave: A little French fry.
###1774 Paul: A (bleep) baby.
###1777 Dave: Come on.
###1779 Going on?
###1780 There he is.
###1781 Little rat.
###1782 Paul: Throw it back.
###1783 We don't want those little (bleep).
###1785 Small fish.
###1786 It's just like a streak of bad luck, that, it happens.
###1789 Dave was pissed.
###1790 (Bleep)!
###1791 What the (Bleep)!
###1794 Dave: Ah, not a (bleep) rat.
###1796 Damnit a rat.
###1799 Oh, man.
###1805 Now what we want.
###1806 Sandro: Look at those huge fins.
###1807 Look at that, it's giant.
###1809 That fish there one day will be a thousand-plus pounds.
###1812 Look at the belly on him.
###1814 Paul: Look how fat he is.
###1818 Sandro: Alright, you can let go.
###1822 Dave: Good-bye.
###1823 Paul: Yeah.
###1826 Dave: Not even close actually,
###1827 we could've used him for bait.
###1829 Real small.
###1830 They got to be 73 inches.
###1831 Those are the regs.
###1832 We follow 'em, so does everybody else, pretty much.
###1835 And, uh, let him go.
###1837 Come back, get him another day.
###1839 Get him in another, what?
###1840 Maybe five, six years?
###1842 Paul: You give back to you save the stocks.
###1845 Keep the fishery alive.
###1847 You don't want to kill every little fish.
###1849 You've gotta give back to the sea, you know?
###1852 It's good karma, too.
###1853 God damn it.
###1857 Dave: Definitely a lot of fish around.
###1859 Both the little ones and the big ones.
###1860 Unfortunately we can't get the big ones to bite.
###1862 I'm very competitive in nature.
###1864 You know, especially with Kevin,
###1865 and he's got us beat right now and I want to beat him.
###1868 I want to beat him in the worst way.
###1881 Donna: You want to put the live guy in, or?
###1884 Bill: Yeah, I was actually thinking about it.
###1888 Donna: Once in a while I have dreams that are really
###1890 whacked out about fishing.
###1894 Dreamt one time that I was tuna fishing off my front
###1897 porch in a puddle, and actually hooked up.
###1901 Yeah.
###1902 Rod was bent over.
###1904 It was great.
###1905 Scott: What the hell is wrong with you?
###1909 Donna: I told you, I'm whacked out, I'm sick.
###1913 Bill: I can't make it happen.
###1914 They just won't get under the boat.
###1917 Dave: I know.
###1917 I feel for you, I do.
###1919 We're rooting for you.
###1920 Bill: You're a lying sack of (bleep).
###1922 Dave: Keep plugging away.
###1923 I don't, I don't know.
###1925 Donna: Again, getting to the point where this is not a
###1928 good habit to be in.
###1930 Glad that Christina got a fish.
###1932 But, doesn't do me any good.
###1934 I'm sure the mood on the Christina is a whole lot
###1937 better than the mood on the Bounty Hunter right now.
###1949 Kevin: We caught a big fish.
###1950 It was almost eleven hundred pounds and it could turn out
###1953 to be the biggest fish of the season.
###1954 We're hot right now.
###1956 We're here to do it again.
###1957 I know the big fish are feeding.
###1959 And I know what they're biting on.
###1960 I think the best part of the whole thing is knowing that
###1963 it's killing Dave.
###1971 Dave: Yeah, let her go.
###1973 You're good.
###1981 Let's go with the fourth bridle.
###1986 Hopefully we can get something here.
###1988 Paul: Kevin, we're coming for you.
###1989 We're gonna kick your (bleep) (bleep),
###1991 so watch the (bleep) out!
###1994 Dave: Day's not over.
###1996 Day's not over.
###2005 Marciano: Today we've got a charter aboard the boat,
###2007 and it's a double-edged sword.
###2008 On the one hand, fifteen hundred bucks is a pretty
###2012 good chunk of change.
###2014 On the other hand, I could be out tuna fishing.
###2016 And I could catch a fish that's worth 10,000 dollars.
###2021 We're doing a little bit of cod fishing right now.
###2023 So what we're going to do is,
###2024 we're gonna hope we can do a little of both here today
###2026 for these guys.
###2027 While we're out there with this charter,
###2029 I'm gonna throw the tuna rod over just for a little
###2031 while, just to see what happens.
###2036 That movie The Perfect Storm,
###2038 I knew a few of those guys on that boat.
###2040 In particular, that guy Sully.
###2043 Now the interesting thing about that, is, uh,
###2045 I was just about to go on that trip.
###2047 That very trip that wound up being that boat's last trip.
###2050 Just two days before we left,
###2052 I got the opportunity for a full-time job on a day boat.
###2055 So I went with the full-time job.
###2057 Like that kid Sully, we were down in the Crow's Nest
###2060 having a few beers and he loaned me some money that
###2063 night.
###2064 He loaned me a few hundred bucks, and to this day,
###2066 I still owe him that money.
###2069 If it wasn't for me getting that full-time day job,
###2072 you know, I'd be with the rest of those guys on the
###2074 Andrea Gail.
###2076 And I wouldn't have any kids.
###2077 Man: Not to mention, you wouldn't be cutting that
###2079 flounder right now.
###2080 Marciano: Yeah.
###2082 Jay: Hey, Dave?
###2083 Marciano: Yeah?
###2084 Jay: That boat's on a fish over there.
###2085 That guy.
###2086 I just watched him do a circle.
###2087 Marciano: Oh, yeah?
###2092 Kevin: Stay on him.
###2095 Which way?
###2097 I need one guy talking to me.
###2099 Scott: Good.
###2099 Good.
###2100 Blair: There, good.
###2101 Scott: Ah, Jesus, pulling hard.
###2103 Kevin: One more circle then I'm coming back.
###2105 Scott: All right, that's good, right there.
###2109 Bill: You've got to be (bleep) me.
###2111 Scott: Kevin on Christina the hug boat, he, uh,
###2114 was here five minutes, he hooked up,
###2115 and he's off fighting the fish right now.
###2118 Bill: How can that be?
###2120 How, how can that be?
###2123 Donna: It be.
###2124 Scott: I'm trying to stay on top of this fish.
###2127 Gonna keep the pressure on him,
###2129 and slowly bring him up.
###2131 Kevin: Dad, get the small harpoon.
###2133 Get the small harpoon.
###2134 I'm gonna come back.
###2135 Tell me when I can come back, Scott.
###2142 Scott: Back, back, back, back, back, back back.
###2143 Kevin: Keep him coming, keep him coming.
###2144 Keep him coming.
###2149 All right, we got him.
###2150 Sammy: I got the gaff.
###2151 Kevin: Gaff.
###2151 Tail, tail wrap.
###2153 Then we're gonna go watch the Patriots, boys.
###2158 All right, now we're roped up.
###2160 Man: I'm on it.
###2160 Get on it.
###2165 Kevin: Nice angling, my friend.
###2169 Let's go guys.
###2170 Pull.
###2174 Man: It's a whale!
###2176 Kevin: Told you they grow when they come in.
###2179 Ooh, that's, uh, that might be a grander.
###2181 Man: It might be, it might be another thousand pounder.
###2185 Kevin: Right there, that's what you do.
###2188 108.
###2191 108.
###2203 Dave: Holy (bleep).
###2212 Oh, there he is!
###2212 We're on!
###2213 We're on, we're on, we're on!
###2214 Paul: Yeah!
###2215 Dave: Yeah, (bleep).
###2216 Go!
###2217 Go!
###2217 This is the one.
###2218 This is the one that's gonna beat Kevin.
###2220 Might be a grander.
###2222 This is it, guys.
###2223 Paul: This is the one that's gonna beat Kevin.
###2224 Dave: Come on, Sandro, come on.
###2226 Paul: This is it, guys.
###2226 Dave: Whoa!
###2235 Dave: Kevin just put another one on the boat.
###2237 Sandro, stay on him.
###2238 Stay on him.
###2239 I know there's a lot more money swimming under the
###2240 boat right now that we're gonna catch.
###2243 Paul: This might be a grander!
###2249 Dave: Come on, Sandro, come on!
###2251 This is the one!
###2254 This might be him.
###2254 This is it, guys.
###2260 God damn it, another (bleep) baby.
###2262 Paul: Oh, there goes this line.
###2265 Dave: Man, I don't have time for this today.
###2270 Paul: Another (bleep) baby.
###2273 Dave: Let it go.
###2274 Let it go for another day.
###2280 Little rats.
###2281 Sandro: A baby.
###2282 Dave: Ready?
###2288 Kevin: Let him go, it's just a baby!
###2290 It's a baby!
###2293 Come on, 144 inches over here, Davy.
###2299 Paul: Kevin, he was being cocky.
###2301 He's like, look at that (bleep) thing,
###2303 look how little it is.
###2304 Kevin: Hundred and forty four inches, Dave.
###2311 Paul: I felt like (bleep) going over there and cutting
###2314 his off.
###2318 Dave: I know I'm never gonna hear the end of Kevin's
###2319 fish.
###2320 He'll find some way to stick it to me.
###2323 Kevin: I've said it to Dave, and I said it to him earlier
###2325 today.
###2326 I said, "Size matters, Dave.
###2327 And you know it."
###2328 There's only room for one Number One in this group,
###2331 and sorry, buddy.
###2333 It's right here.
###2346 Came in early because, uh, couple reasons.
###2349 Boat's full.
###2352 Which is a good thing.
###2354 We pretty much went through all the tackle that we had,
###2356 and, you know, I'm just, I'm just beat.
###2358 I'm beat.
###2359 We couldn't have hit that one better.
###2360 Man: We need those dots back.
###2362 Kevin: Yeah, we're out of dots.
###2363 That's another reason we came in.
###2365 We had no dots, we're out of dots.
###2375 Man 1: Close to 800.
###2376 Seven and change.
###2377 Big fish.
###2380 Man 2: Here's your receipt.
###2381 Good job.
###2382 Kevin: Thanks.
###2383 Man 2: Good job.
###2384 Kevin: I'm hanging on with the biggest fish out of the
###2386 group here, so.
###2388 Uh, I don't think, uh, delicate Dave's gonna beat
###2390 it.
###2392 Man: See you, guys.
###2394 Kevin: It's been a good week,
###2395 but the Pats are playing tonight.
###2397 I'd like to see this game.
###2405 Jay: This is how the rig's gotta be.
###2406 It's gotta be right on the bottom, like that.
###2407 Man 1: Yeah.
###2408 Jay: Keep it tight.
###2409 Man 1: Yeah.
###2410 Marciano: Guys are hooking up.
###2411 I can see their bent rods from here.
###2413 But I got to sit here and tell fishing stories.
###2416 I might shift in a minute, guys.
###2418 I don't see us getting much good here.
###2419 We'll give it a few more minutes.
###2421 Man 2: I'm good for
###2421 one minute.
###2422 Ask my wife.
###2423 Ha ha ha.
###2425 Man 3: That is so stupid.
###2428 Jay: Oh, we're on, we're on, we're on!
###2429 We're on!
###2432 Dave!
###2438 Jay: Um, about a 300-pounder!
###2441 Man 2: Go, Dave, come on!
###2443 Jay: We got you, Dave!
###2444 Man 3: Marciano, he's bringing him in.
###2448 Jay: He's coming right at us.
###2449 There he is.
###2450 Man 3: There we go.
###2451 Man 2: Let's get him!
###2451 Man 3: Let's go!
###2452 Jay: I saw his tail.
###2453 Right there, right there!
###2456 My (bleep) heart's out of my chest right now.
###2460 Marciano: This I think is about a 400-pound fish.
###2463 So we know he's gonna be at least five grand for me.
###2466 Man 2: Come on!
###2467 Man 3: Yeah, come on, Dave, here we go!
###2468 Marciano: Watch what I'm doing, alright guys?
###2470 We'll give you a little time on the rod?
###2472 Man: Yep.
###2473 Marciano: You saw how we did it, right?
###2474 You pull with one, reel in the other.
###2477 You know, for me, now we're hooked up to an eight or
###2479 eight or 10,000 dollar fish.
###2481 I did have a little, you know,
###2482 anxiety letting these guys get in on the game,
###2485 fight the fish for a little while.
###2487 You gotta keep that rod bent for me though.
###2489 Jay: Nice and easy Johnny!
###2490 Man: The Tuna God, thatta boy, Johnny boy.
###2492 You're the man!
###2493 Marciano: It's not gonna be very exciting for them if
###2496 Jay and I just bring the fish in.
###2498 Who's gonna pay you to do that?
###2500 Well if they get a taste of this,
###2501 they're gonna want to come back and do more.
###2504 All right, watch the tip.
###2505 While you guys are fighting this fish, watch the tip.
###2507 That's the key.
###2508 The part that bothers me a little bit about this
###2510 situation, you can lose one so easily.
###2513 And now I gotta have six cherries on the rod,
###2516 so they can all get a little turn?
###2518 You know, that's the potential for making six new
###2521 guy mistakes which could cost me this
###2524 8,000-dollar fish?
###2527 Eventually, and we got to land that fish.
###2529 All 800 pounds of him.
###2532 Broke the (bleep) tail strap.
###2533 Jay: Oh, my goodness.
###2539 Wow.
###2542 It is a big (bleep) fish.
###2544 He's way bigger.
###2545 Marciano: It was a thrill for them to see such a big,
###2547 beautiful fish up close and personal.
###2550 Now we got him.
###2554 Man 3: Jesus, feel that derma.
###2556 Marciano: Hard, huh?
###2557 Man: Say thank you.
###2558 Feel it, feel it.
###2560 Man: Whoa.
###2561 Oh my God.
###2562 Look at that frigging football.
###2575 Dave: Kevin got a big thousand pounder now and
###2577 we're here to catch a big fish and it didn't happen.
###2579 Paul: Dave's been beside himself that Kevin got that
###2583 big fish.
###2584 Dave: I want to beat his (bleep).
###2585 That's what's important here,
###2586 it's not about the dollars anymore,
###2587 it's about the biggest fish.
###2589 Paul: I said, "Don't worry.
###2589 We'll get one bigger than Kevin's.
###2591 You just wait."
###2592 Dave: We deserve to be on top.
###2593 I mean, we're working hardest at it.
###2594 I'm not gonna sleep until I get a bigger fish than
###2597 Kevin.
###2599 Paul: You know what Kevin?
###2600 We're (bleep) coming for you, dude.
###2610 Marciano: This morning, I wasn't too thrilled about
###2612 this trip.
###2613 But I gotta admit, it was fun to have an audience
###2616 cheering me on.
###2618 Tail's up, man.
###2619 That's what it's all about right there.
###2621 A couple of you kneel down in front of him
###2622 so we can get everybody in, even the whole fish.
###2626 I love it when a plan comes together.
###2628 As a rule of thumb, I don't like people on my boat.
###2630 But this is a great bunch of guys.
###2635 'Cause this is the part we get paid for.
###2636 We don't get paid for the head.
###2637 We don't get paid for the tail.
###2639 We get paid for the meat.
###2643 Man 2: You know what I got to tell you?
###2645 You made sure that each of us got to take a little
###2647 turn.
###2648 Marciano: Yeah?
###2649 Man 2: Reeling that fish in.
###2650 I know it was a lot of money for you.
###2651 And, we, you know, we're all rookies, and everything.
###2652 Marciano: Right.
###2654 Man 2: But the fact that you thought of enough to make
###2655 sure we all it meant a lot to us.
###2658 Marciano: Good, good.
###2658 I'm glad you enjoyed it.
###2659 That's what it's all about.
###2660 Man 2: Thank you very much.
###2661 Man 4: Best Captain on the planet, right there.
###2662 Man 1: Right there, buddy, right there.
###2663 Man 4: Captain Dave Marciano.
###2665 The best.
###2666 Not just because I'm married to your sister.
###2667 Jay: What, what about the best crew?
###2668 Nothing about the crew?
###2670 Nothing about the crew?
###2671 Man: Who's he?
###2673 Jay: Who's this guy?
###2674 Man 2: I thought he worked here.
###2675 Thank you, fellas.
###2678 Great trip.
