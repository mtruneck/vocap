###19 It was an incredible thing to see. We are going to tell you how it all turned out.
###23 I`m Carl Azuz. Welcome to a new week of CNN STUDENT NEWS.
###28 Last week we reported on Malala Yousafzai. She`s a blogger and an activist for education
###33 and women`s rights. She`s 14 years old. Last Tuesday, Malala was targeted and shot by the
###39 Taliban. That`s a militant group that has a strong presence in the part of Pakistan
###43 where Malala lives. Lot of her country has rallied behind her. Thousands of people turning
###48 out to be part of a demonstration in the city of Karachi this weekend. They were showing
###52 their support for Malala and speaking out against the Taliban and its strict policies.
###58 Those include denying girls the chance to get an education, and that`s something that
###63 Malala spoke out against. Pakistani officials say doctors are keeping a close watch on Malala.
###68 As of yesterday afternoon, she was unconscious and using a breathing machine, but authorities
###73 said she is making slow and steady progress.

###77 See if you can I.D. me. I am an organization that was established
###84 after World War II. I currently have 27 member countries. A continent is a part of my name,
###90 and my currency is the Euro.
###95 I`m the European Union. And I`m responsible for my members` economic, social and security policies
###102 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###105 The Nobel Committee says the European Union`s efforts to advance peace, democracy
###110 and human rights are why that organization, the European Union is this year`s winner of
###115 the Nobel Peace Prize. The award was announced last Friday. It`s not the first time that
###119 an organization has won the Peace Prize instead of an individual person. The committee says
###124 the E.U.`s win is a message to the whole world about finding ways to solve conflicts.
###129 For more, we turn to Jonathan Mann.

###133 Look past all the protests in the streets of Spain and Greece.
###140 Look past all the high level talks and tangled finances. Look back to the centuries
###146 of war in Europe, a place where nowadays dozens of countries are so completely at peace that
###152 virtually no one notices. The Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded the Peace Prize for 2012
###158 to the European Union. Because born out of the ashes of World War II as a way to unify
###163 the continent and keep it from fighting again, the Nobel Committee says the European Union has worked.
###169 THORBJORN JAGLAND, CHAIR OF THE NORWEGIAN NOBEL COMMITTEE: Over a 70 year period, Germany
###172 and France had fought three wars. Today, war between Germany and France had -- is unthinkable.
###180 This shows of true well aimed efforts and while building mutual confidence,
###189 historic enemies can become close parties.
###191 The partnership now includes 27 nations, with more waiting to join. 500 million people
###198 grappling with their own national politics evolving European institutions, and its still
###203 experimental common currency mired in crisis. Everything from interest rates to austerity
###208 measures and unemployment eventually leads back to the E.U. In the streets of Spain,
###214 where the economy went from boom to bust, the E.U. is both credited and criticized,
###219 and its Nobel Prize got a mixed reaction.
###222 All right. We are wrapping up out Hispanic heritage month coverage today with a tasty
###227 segment for you. Here is some food for thought: did you know the names of some of the things
###232 we eat and drink have Spanish ties. Like the chocolate in my hot chocolate. It`s pronounced
###239 chocolate, the word comes from Nahuatl,, which is a group of languages from parts of Mexico
###245 and Central America. Another tasty word with Spanish routs is tomato, the name of this fruit
###251 yes, this is technically a fruit, comes from Nahuatl, too. In Spanish, it`s tomate.
###256 We can`t give you fruit and dessert without a main course. Tuna, like the fish, comes
###261 from the Spanish word, atun.
###266 I think it`s a pretty amazing event, that`s why I`m here with my daughter,
###270 to make sure that she sees it and is a part of it.
###273 Also, once in a lifetime thing to see a special, all going down the street,
###276 especially at the streets of L.A., so I had to see it.
###285 You heard it right, and it was a sight to see. A space shuttle rolling down the streets
###290 of Los Angeles, not part of a movie, it`s the final act for NASA`s shuttle program.
###296 That is Endeavour. It flew 123 million miles in space cruising along at supersonic speed.
###303 This weekend, it was crawling, just crawling along the roads of California. It`s not because
###309 of traffic. Endeavour had the streets to itself, as it`s slowly made its way to the California
###313 Science Center where it`s going on display. It turns out, this last journey had some holdups.
###319 Streets, no surprise aren`t designed for shuttles that are nearly 80 feet wide and more than
###324 120 feet long. So some road signs had to be taken down, some trees, some of them very
###330 old, had to be cut down. But officials said aside from that, there were no reports of
###334 damage to or by the shuttle.
###338 This was more like a space dive than a sky dive. Yesterday afternoon, Felix Baumgartner
###344 was trying to set the record for the highest jump, from 120,000 feet above the Earth. Not
###351 exactly, how it went down. He stepped out from his capsule at 128,000 feet. That is
###357 more than 24 miles up. Scientists say, he broke the speed of sound as he hurdled toward
###363 earth. You can imagine what that must have felt like. It took ten minutes for the 43-year
###368 old Austrian daredevil known as Fearless Felix to be back on solid ground. Max Foster spoke
###375 to him before his record shattering skydive.
###378 What no man has ever done before: jump from a capsule
###383 attached to a giant balloon from 120,000 feet where the view looks like this.
###390 I`m going to slide the door open, bail out
###394 and then going to be the first human person in freefall, who`s breaking the speed of sound.
###399 FOSTER: He makes it sound simple enough, but Felix Baumgartner`s attempt to jump from the
###404 edge of space comes after five years of exhaustive testing, development and even a legal hatch.
###410 What`s the biggest challenge here, why have - has no one tried it before
###416 and what`s the challenge that you`ve managed to overcome to make it possible?
###419 It needs a lot of research, it`s not just you lock yourself in a pressure capsule
###425 and you go up, you need a lot of research. You need to find the right people to work with.
###429 Explain a bit more about the suit, how it works, and what sort of technology is in there.
###434 So the suit is protecting you. It provides you with oxygen, it keeps temperature,
###439 the cold temperature out. It also -- you also need the pressure suit, because if you reach
###444 65,000 feet, which is called the Armstrong Line, your blood starts boiling. And that
###449 suit keeps you alive.
###451 It`s beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
###455 Baumgartner is no stranger to death-defying stunts. He has based- jumped from the world`s tallest buildings,
###461 set a record for the lowest such jump of Rio`s Christ the Redeemer statue
###468 and completed the first crossing of the English Channel with a specially made fiber wing.
###473 But freefalling from the edge of space is a whole new ball game.
###476 The big problem that we faced here, is at 120,000 feet you have no supportive air.
###481 So the first 30 seconds, you cannot use the air, and that requires a really stable
###486 exit, that`s the reason why we practiced a lot of bungee jumps.
###492 Perfect.
###493 You had a chance to meet Neil Armstrong. I just wanted to ask you about
###497 it, in 2010, didn`t you? So, what advice did he give you?
###501 Well, he said, go for it, you`ve got the right team behind you, you are prepared,
###505 you have the skills, so he definitely thinks it`s possible.
###512 Halloween still a couple of weeks away, but we are giving you a spooky showcase for
###518 your creative pumpkin projects right now.
###521 We are talking about Halloween I-reports. You`ve got to be at least 13, send us your
###525 best by October, 26th, and your pumpkin, which doesn`t have to have my face on it, could
###531 pop up on cnn/studentnews. Boo-ya!
###535 Before we go, maybe you don`t agree with one contestant in this cook-off, who said it`s
###540 what nature intended for people to eat. But if you are looking to make your taste buds
###544 really jump, you might go nuts for squirrel, and not just run off the fence grilled squirrel.
###550 We are talking about jalapeno squirrel poppers. Squirrel burgers and sliders, bacon wraps
###555 squirrel wings, not sure how they pulled off that last recipe, since squirrels don`t have
###561 wings, but there is no way we are going to squirrel out of having a little pun with this.
###564 Of course, it might sound a little nutty, some of you think all of our pans are acorny,
###568 but we always hop at the chance to put them to the nest, and frankly, I see nutting wrong
###572 with that. Thanks to our Facebook and Twitter followers for helping out with those,
###575 CNN STUDENT NEWS, we`ll tree you tomorrow.
