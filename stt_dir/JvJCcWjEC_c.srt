1
0:0:0,86 --> 0:0:4,485
Sometimes a person
asks a question


2
0:0:4,485 --> 0:0:8,739
in a field that they
know very little about.


3
0:0:8,739 --> 0:0:14,935
If a person's not familiar
with electronics at all


4
0:0:14,935 --> 0:0:18,139
says "What if the
machine breaks down?"


5
0:0:18,139 --> 0:0:21,489
An electronics person doesn't
know what he's talking about.


6
0:0:21,489 --> 0:0:25,884
Is it the transistors, the capacitors,
the circuit, the welding?


7
0:0:25,884 --> 0:0:30,401
If you don't talk about specifics,
you're not communicating.


8
0:0:30,401 --> 0:0:35,359
When a person says to me "You can't
predict the behavior of people"


9
0:0:35,359 --> 0:0:37,524
they're telling me
that they don't know


10
0:0:37,524 --> 0:0:40,39
how to predict the
behavior of people.


11
0:0:40,39 --> 0:0:44,931
It's a subject that I can't do
anything with unless they say


12
0:0:44,931 --> 0:0:48,876
"What do you do about people
that insist that they're right?"


13
0:0:48,876 --> 0:0:51,735
That's a specific question.


14
0:0:51,735 --> 0:0:55,648
A specific question is "How do
you arrive at your decision


15
0:0:55,648 --> 0:1:0,322
and why is your decision any
better than any other decision?"


16
0:1:0,322 --> 0:1:2,887
The person that
asks that question


17
0:1:2,887 --> 0:1:6,281
may or may not
understand the answer.


18
0:1:6,281 --> 0:1:10,289
The assumption that people understand
the answer that you give them


19
0:1:10,289 --> 0:1:13,652
is an assumption and projection.


20
0:1:13,652 --> 0:1:16,389
In order to check it out


21
0:1:16,389 --> 0:1:19,473
if you have the time and
you have a few people


22
0:1:19,473 --> 0:1:22,682
you can say "What do you
think I mean by that?"


23
0:1:22,682 --> 0:1:24,935
and if they come off
with something 'off'


24
0:1:24,935 --> 0:1:30,471
you know that they didn't
get your intention.


25
0:1:30,471 --> 0:1:34,962
People that work on
automobiles, engineers


26
0:1:34,962 --> 0:1:40,363
not mechanics (mechanics are a
little different than engineers).


27
0:1:40,363 --> 0:1:45,452
Engineers understand the
efficiency ratio of the parts


28
0:1:45,452 --> 0:1:50,132
how many miles you get
per gallon of fuel


29
0:1:50,132 --> 0:1:53,419
and the technician
understands the function


30
0:1:53,419 --> 0:1:55,956
of all the parts of the car.


31
0:1:55,956 --> 0:2:0,842
If you say "Automobiles are unsafe!
" with conviction


32
0:2:0,842 --> 0:2:3,746
that doesn't tell you
how to make them safer.


33
0:2:3,746 --> 0:2:7,56
It doesn't tell you
anything, unless you say


34
0:2:7,56 --> 0:2:9,491
"If you make the brake
drums an inch larger


35
0:2:9,491 --> 0:2:14,402
the car will stop sooner
," something you can use.


36
0:2:14,402 --> 0:2:17,715
A non-answerable question is


37
0:2:17,715 --> 0:2:20,387
"How are you going to control the population?
You can't control


38
0:2:20,387 --> 0:2:23,249
the population.
They go right on multiplying!"


39
0:2:23,249 --> 0:2:27,687
The question is "How do you
control the population?"


40
0:2:27,687 --> 0:2:31,81
and not "You can't control the population.
They go right on multiplying!"


41
0:2:31,81 --> 0:2:33,999
That does not give
you alternatives.


42
0:2:33,999 --> 0:2:39,58
When a person says "You can't
make airplanes absolutely safe"


43
0:2:39,58 --> 0:2:42,22
what the hell does that tell you?
Nothing


44
0:2:42,22 --> 0:2:47,425
except for that person's limited
ability to participate.


45
0:2:47,425 --> 0:2:52,12
If a man would say "If you
made airplanes safer..."


46
0:2:52,12 --> 0:2:55,208
that doesn't tell you
anything you can use either


47
0:2:55,208 --> 0:2:58,7
so you have to discredit that.
If a person says


48
0:2:58,7 --> 0:3:2,302
"Governments have been corrupt
ever since history began!"


49
0:3:2,302 --> 0:3:5,609
That doesn't tell you how
to make them 'uncorrupt.'


50
0:3:5,609 --> 0:3:9,15
They have nothing to
offer, unless you show


51
0:3:9,15 --> 0:3:12,409
a method of making
a government work


52
0:3:12,409 --> 0:3:15,787
unless you say "I
would like to know


53
0:3:15,787 --> 0:3:19,1
what your view is on this."


54
0:3:19,1 --> 0:3:20,84
If a person comes
up to me and says


55
0:3:20,84 --> 0:3:25,913
"What is your view on
automobile safety?"


56
0:3:25,913 --> 0:3:28,995
I'd say "Do you know
anything about automobiles:


57
0:3:28,995 --> 0:3:32,433
the mechanisms, the valves,
what they're for?" "No?"


58
0:3:32,433 --> 0:3:36,962
Then you can't talk about the
anatomy of the automobile.


59
0:3:36,962 --> 0:3:38,867
Do you understand that?


60
0:3:38,867 --> 0:3:43,316
If you know nothing about the human
body, you can't talk about anatomy.


61
0:3:43,316 --> 0:3:46,344
"People get sick and we
don't always know why."


62
0:3:46,344 --> 0:3:50,123
That's something you
can't do anything with


63
0:3:50,123 --> 0:3:52,8
If you say "You can't
predict human beings.


64
0:3:52,8 --> 0:3:54,913
They all come from
different environments


65
0:3:54,913 --> 0:3:56,93
and they have many
different reactions.


66
0:3:56,93 --> 0:3:59,746
You can't make them all
react the same way."


67
0:3:59,746 --> 0:4:1,39
That doesn't tell you anything


68
0:4:1,39 --> 0:4:6,439
except the person's limitations
that they're talking about.


69
0:4:6,439 --> 0:4:11,62
If you're not equipped to understand
the answer, you can't ask questions.


70
0:4:11,62 --> 0:4:14,826
If a guy says "You know,
electronics can fail too!"


71
0:4:14,826 --> 0:4:19,774
That's participation,
but offering nothing.


72
0:4:19,774 --> 0:4:23,5
Do you understand that?


73
0:4:23,5 --> 0:4:26,594
Sometimes I will not
engage a person


74
0:4:26,594 --> 0:4:29,75
if I feel they're not
talking about the subject.


75
0:4:29,75 --> 0:4:33,56
If they say "You can't
predict human behavior.


76
0:4:33,56 --> 0:4:36,92
Different people may have different views.
" "Well, that's true.


77
0:4:36,92 --> 0:4:39,63
Give me the different views."


78
0:4:39,63 --> 0:4:41,318
"Let's make our building
ten stories high


79
0:4:41,318 --> 0:4:44,155
instead of four.
" "Why do you want to do that?"


80
0:4:44,155 --> 0:4:48,813
Just talk about the subject!


81
0:4:48,813 --> 0:4:52,551
Remember this.
This is the thing you have to remember.


82
0:4:52,551 --> 0:4:55,99
People will talk about
all kinds of things


83
0:4:55,99 --> 0:4:58,74
but not when their
car breaks down.


84
0:4:58,74 --> 0:5:1,305
They take it to
an auto mechanic.


85
0:5:1,305 --> 0:5:3,416
When the air-conditioning
breaks down


86
0:5:3,416 --> 0:5:7,9
they take it to an
air-conditioning mechanic.


87
0:5:7,9 --> 0:5:9,49
You can go to the baker


88
0:5:9,49 --> 0:5:12,267
and he can say "Well,
I don't know.


89
0:5:12,267 --> 0:5:17,442
Check the input and output
," but he doesn't know.


90
0:5:17,442 --> 0:5:20,426
Everybody likes to
feel competent.


91
0:5:20,426 --> 0:5:24,7
Everybody likes to feel
they want to participate.


92
0:5:24,7 --> 0:5:26,36
The question is, can they?


93
0:5:26,36 --> 0:5:29,75
The only way you can
participate in anything


94
0:5:29,75 --> 0:5:33,417
is to offer a tangible,
referential description.


95
0:5:33,417 --> 0:5:38,182
If you believe that all things
are affected by other things


96
0:5:38,182 --> 0:5:41,976
that means that human
behavior is predictable


97
0:5:41,976 --> 0:5:46,719
if you believe that
conditioning shapes behavior.


98
0:5:46,719 --> 0:5:50,601
If you think it's 'inborn,'
you can't think about it.


99
0:5:50,601 --> 0:5:53,162
You can't predict.


100
0:5:53,162 --> 0:5:57,657
You say "Who the hell knows what the
inborn emotions are going to be!"


101
0:5:57,657 --> 0:6:0,601
If you can't predict it,
you can't deal with it.


102
0:6:0,601 --> 0:6:3,938
If you believe that people scratch
their heads because it itches


103
0:6:3,938 --> 0:6:7,376
or they think it itches,
that's all right


104
0:6:7,376 --> 0:6:9,8
as long as you know why.


105
0:6:9,8 --> 0:6:11,839
Every act, like if a person
adjusts their glasses


106
0:6:11,839 --> 0:6:15,86
it means their ear pressure is
bad or the vision is not good


107
0:6:15,86 --> 0:6:17,686
or the glasses are too low


108
0:6:17,686 --> 0:6:21,415
and they move it up, you have to
ask why they move the glasses.


109
0:6:21,415 --> 0:6:23,817
You can take guesses


110
0:6:23,817 --> 0:6:27,189
but that's not why they
move their eyeglasses.


111
0:6:27,189 --> 0:6:31,33
If you believe that human
behavior is based upon


112
0:6:31,33 --> 0:6:34,974
what Skinner is known
for, reinforcement


113
0:6:34,974 --> 0:6:38,127
he says people will do anything


114
0:6:38,127 --> 0:6:43,176
if you reinforce
them in their terms.


115
0:6:43,176 --> 0:6:47,919
A person asks "Do you allow for
individuality in that society?"


116
0:6:47,919 --> 0:6:53,256
Individuality to me means,
differences in values


117
0:6:53,256 --> 0:6:56,55
by different aspects
of the culture.


118
0:6:56,55 --> 0:6:59,312
We can't afford all
kinds of individuals.


119
0:6:59,312 --> 0:7:4,867
When a guy wants to wear a
suit with 3 creases in it


120
0:7:4,867 --> 0:7:10,357
well, that's individual.
But it's 'unsane' individuality.


121
0:7:10,357 --> 0:7:14,71
'Unsane' individuality
is when people say


122
0:7:14,71 --> 0:7:17,818
"I've got a new
dance, it's this.


123
0:7:17,818 --> 0:7:21,525
You don't need to get up!
" Well, that's an individual


124
0:7:21,525 --> 0:7:25,65
but that dance doesn't
do anything for people.


125
0:7:25,65 --> 0:7:28,354
Convincing them of that,
do they want to know?


126
0:7:28,354 --> 0:7:31,4
"What do you think of
this type of dancing?"


127
0:7:31,4 --> 0:7:35,538
I would say, it's no different,
no better, no worse


128
0:7:35,538 --> 0:7:40,735
than existing dancing, but I can't
deal with that kind of problem.


129
0:7:40,735 --> 0:7:43,425
If I say dancing is
a 'nothing' thing


130
0:7:43,425 --> 0:7:46,144
I mean, what does it contribute?


131
0:7:46,144 --> 0:7:49,926
It contributes to the well-being of people.
They feel good, dancing.


132
0:7:49,926 --> 0:7:53,51
Is that important?
What if they want to see a bullfight?


133
0:7:53,51 --> 0:7:56,749
They feel good
watching a bullfight.


134
0:7:56,749 --> 0:7:59,295
"Feel good" is not
the ultimate answer


135
0:7:59,295 --> 0:8:2,835
it's the collective
utility of the answer


136
0:8:2,835 --> 0:8:4,73
that I would go by.


137
0:8:4,73 --> 0:8:8,248
What will benefit people most?
To know about


138
0:8:8,248 --> 0:8:11,551
basic things, how they work,
how a flashlight works


139
0:8:11,551 --> 0:8:16,659
how automobiles are interconnected,
how we relate to the environment.


140
0:8:16,659 --> 0:8:20,76
If you say man is part of nature


141
0:8:20,76 --> 0:8:23,66
say without food,
man cannot survive.


142
0:8:23,66 --> 0:8:27,7
That's what I mean by that when
I say he's part of nature.


143
0:8:27,7 --> 0:8:30,842
If the oxygen is not in
the air, he will die.


144
0:8:30,842 --> 0:8:34,618
He thinks he's part of nature
because he doesn't know


145
0:8:34,618 --> 0:8:36,615
that we depend on nitrogen.


146
0:8:36,615 --> 0:8:39,787
Lightning fixes the
nitrogen in the soil.


147
0:8:39,787 --> 0:8:44,2
It makes it available to plants.


148
0:8:44,2 --> 0:8:46,629
Is that the purpose of lightning?
No.


149
0:8:46,629 --> 0:8:51,412
Lightning occurs and
nitrogen becomes modified.


150
0:8:51,412 --> 0:8:55,813
But lightning is not there
to modify the nitrogen.


151
0:8:55,813 --> 0:9:1,812
You can tell by ...
electricity would flow only in the ground


152
0:9:1,812 --> 0:9:5,756
and modify the nitrogen only.
It wouldn't go through the atmosphere


153
0:9:5,756 --> 0:9:10,121
and hit a tree and a
little girl on a bicycle.


154
0:9:10,121 --> 0:9:14,287
Then it means it wasn't
designed for a purpose.


155
0:9:14,287 --> 0:9:17,177
If you have ice weather, you say


156
0:9:17,177 --> 0:9:22,66
"The purpose of winter is to give us
a change in season. We need change."


157
0:9:22,66 --> 0:9:25,801
People living in the tropics
have never heard of winter time


158
0:9:25,801 --> 0:9:27,862
those who've been
brought up there


159
0:9:27,862 --> 0:9:30,32
and they wouldn't know
what you're talking about.


160
0:9:30,32 --> 0:9:33,567
If they say "What
is the winter for?"


161
0:9:33,567 --> 0:9:37,455
you'd reply "Well...
it's to give us a change in season."


162
0:9:37,455 --> 0:9:39,951
The average person not being


163
0:9:39,951 --> 0:9:43,605
a meteorologist (a
student of weather)


164
0:9:43,605 --> 0:9:46,133
doesn't know what
questions to ask


165
0:9:46,133 --> 0:9:49,846
but there are lots of kids who
would love to participate.


166
0:9:49,846 --> 0:9:53,734
So they'll say "What if a person
doesn't want to live in that city?"


167
0:9:53,734 --> 0:9:57,666
They're looking for
participation.


168
0:9:57,666 --> 0:10:2,317
If you say "The water supply
is not even in all the houses.


169
0:10:2,317 --> 0:10:6,166
Can you make it so that all people
get water when they want it?"


170
0:10:6,166 --> 0:10:8,913
that's what they want to
know, but you can't say


171
0:10:8,913 --> 0:10:10,938
"What if I don't want
to live in that city?"


172
0:10:10,938 --> 0:10:14,542
That's just bringing
up an argument


173
0:10:14,542 --> 0:10:19,97
do you see, for the
recognition of participation.


174
0:10:19,97 --> 0:10:24,35
Real participation
is "How would you


175
0:10:24,35 --> 0:10:27,58
acclimate people to this design


176
0:10:27,58 --> 0:10:31,786
if they were brought up to
believe in individual housing?"


177
0:10:31,786 --> 0:10:34,232
You can't do that
unless you tell them


178
0:10:34,232 --> 0:10:36,769
where people get
their values from.


179
0:10:36,769 --> 0:10:40,39
If you live in an igloo
or a thatched hut


180
0:10:40,39 --> 0:10:46,561
or a wigwam, those
become normal to you.


181
0:10:46,561 --> 0:10:49,906
Your assumption that you've
answered a person's question


182
0:10:49,906 --> 0:10:54,92
is an assumption unless you ask
them "What do you think I mean?"


183
0:10:54,92 --> 0:10:57,375
and they come up with something
entirely different, you say


184
0:10:57,375 --> 0:11:0,439
"Apparently I was unable
to get that across"


185
0:11:0,439 --> 0:11:3,179
or they don't have
the background


186
0:11:3,179 --> 0:11:7,678
to understand what went
wrong with the electronics.


187
0:11:7,678 --> 0:11:10,859
If you tell them "The kidney


188
0:11:10,859 --> 0:11:13,972
and the spleen are not
working properly"


189
0:11:13,972 --> 0:11:18,101
and they say "Oh" but
they don't know anything.


190
0:11:18,101 --> 0:11:22,146
In order to know things, you have
to get the handbook of the spleen


191
0:11:22,146 --> 0:11:25,312
and anatomy of different organs:


192
0:11:25,312 --> 0:11:27,524
how they work, what they do.


193
0:11:27,524 --> 0:11:31,493
Do the organs work or are
they controlled by emotions?


194
0:11:31,493 --> 0:11:35,9
If you study emotions and
the effect on organs


195
0:11:35,9 --> 0:11:37,464
which is another
subject all together:


196
0:11:37,464 --> 0:11:40,348
the psychology of illness.


197
0:11:40,348 --> 0:11:44,9
It isn't always the
failure of the kidney.


198
0:11:44,9 --> 0:11:47,34
It could be the failure
of love of life in you.


199
0:11:47,34 --> 0:11:50,24
If your whole family is killed
in an automobile accident


200
0:11:50,24 --> 0:11:52,486
you may not want
to live anymore.


201
0:11:52,486 --> 0:11:55,104
They call that the will to die


202
0:11:55,104 --> 0:11:58,956
and there are some people
that can will death.


203
0:11:58,956 --> 0:12:2,193
I know it seems strange but
they go to bed at night


204
0:12:2,193 --> 0:12:5,87
and they don't feel alive,
and they don't sleep well.


205
0:12:5,87 --> 0:12:10,11
They miss the other people
and their life has been cut


206
0:12:10,11 --> 0:12:12,337
what they call their life.


207
0:12:12,337 --> 0:12:16,538
If people live in a world
where everybody is friendly


208
0:12:16,538 --> 0:12:19,418
everybody is concerned
about your well-being


209
0:12:19,418 --> 0:12:23,487
when your closest friend
dies, you're not left alone.


210
0:12:23,487 --> 0:12:27,3
"How am I going to pay the rent?
How am I going to eat?"


211
0:12:27,3 --> 0:12:29,813
People live alone today


212
0:12:29,813 --> 0:12:33,204
and I would say that if
everybody tried to work


213
0:12:33,204 --> 0:12:38,212
to enhance the lives of everybody
else, you wouldn't be desolate


214
0:12:38,212 --> 0:12:41,972
when somebody died in your family
that was important to you.


215
0:12:41,972 --> 0:12:44,666
There is no communication
with people


216
0:12:44,666 --> 0:12:47,684
that are not schooled
in that discipline.


217
0:12:47,684 --> 0:12:51,594
What you have to do is teach
them that discipline first


218
0:12:51,594 --> 0:12:55,91
that their behavior is not their
own; it's shaped by culture.


219
0:12:55,91 --> 0:12:58,204
If you can convince
them, do that first


220
0:12:58,204 --> 0:13:1,867
and then go off in a different
direction, you're better off.


221
0:13:1,867 --> 0:13:6,519
If you show them... If they believe
that every person's an individual


222
0:13:6,519 --> 0:13:9,616
and individuality is
within the person


223
0:13:9,616 --> 0:13:13,157
if you can't disprove that,
get out of the conversation


224
0:13:13,157 --> 0:13:16,5
because you can't
take it anywhere.


225
0:13:16,5 --> 0:13:17,899
If you get mad at somebody


226
0:13:17,899 --> 0:13:22,849
it means you really don't
understand this subject.


227
0:13:22,849 --> 0:13:26,737
If a guy says "You wanna fight?"


228
0:13:26,737 --> 0:13:32,8
he believes that if he can beat
you in a fight, he's right.


229
0:13:32,8 --> 0:13:36,468
He may be better at fighting than you
are, but it doesn't make him right.


230
0:13:36,468 --> 0:13:39,23
Normal, ordinary people believe


231
0:13:39,23 --> 0:13:43,281
that the guy who's better
at fighting is right.


232
0:13:43,281 --> 0:13:47,961
"Right is might!
" You've heard that shit.


233
0:13:47,961 --> 0:13:51,899
If you're right, you can get
the shit kicked out of you.


234
0:13:51,899 --> 0:13:56,172
Do you understand questions and answers?
There are no answers.


235
0:13:56,172 --> 0:13:59,453
An answer is...
Can you answer this question:


236
0:13:59,453 --> 0:14:3,457
What makes war, like there's an answer?
This is the answer:


237
0:14:3,457 --> 0:14:8,72
It's a whole study of kingdoms
and habits of thought


238
0:14:8,72 --> 0:14:10,939
and this nation is different
than the other nation


239
0:14:10,939 --> 0:14:13,299
and believes their
way is the right way


240
0:14:13,299 --> 0:14:16,139
so they try to kill
the other nation.


241
0:14:16,139 --> 0:14:19,999
Are they bad? No.
Are they murderers? No.


242
0:14:19,999 --> 0:14:23,205
They're victims of a
different culture.


243
0:14:23,205 --> 0:14:26,52
If you can't get to people


244
0:14:26,52 --> 0:14:29,74
instead of saying they're dumb,
either you don't have the time


245
0:14:29,74 --> 0:14:32,496
to build a referential language


246
0:14:32,496 --> 0:14:35,742
or they don't have the
background to understand you.


247
0:14:35,742 --> 0:14:37,4
That's possible.


248
0:14:37,4 --> 0:14:41,355
I wanted you to get this bit
so you don't waste your time.


249
0:14:41,355 --> 0:14:46,635
I don't talk to people
that raise questions like:


250
0:14:46,635 --> 0:16:46,635
"You can't predict human behavior.
" I can't do anything with that.
