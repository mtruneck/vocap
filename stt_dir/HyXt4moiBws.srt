0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:4,68



2
0:0:4,68 --> 0:0:8,18
"A naturalist is considered
someone who prefers to hang


3
0:0:8,18 --> 0:0:11,45
around without clothes."
You're on


4
0:0:11,45 --> 0:0:12,7
to me, Johnny Bonehead.


5
0:0:12,7 --> 0:0:17,63



6
0:0:17,63 --> 0:0:21,2
I'm Mike Shaw here with
Motherboard, and we're here to


7
0:0:21,2 --> 0:0:25,64
respond to the video First
Animal to Survive in Space.


8
0:0:25,64 --> 0:0:28,2
We were really floored
by all the comments--


9
0:0:28,2 --> 0:0:29,49
20,000 and growing.


10
0:0:29,49 --> 0:0:32,119
And keep those comments coming,
we do appreciate it.


11
0:0:32,119 --> 0:0:34,38
I'm very grateful for
the response.


12
0:0:34,38 --> 0:0:38,78
And now let's get to some of
your questions and comments.


13
0:0:38,78 --> 0:0:40,95
"This stuff ain't new.


14
0:0:40,95 --> 0:0:43,67
I saw a special on these things
four years ago on


15
0:0:43,67 --> 0:0:45,1
Discovery Channel.


16
0:0:45,1 --> 0:0:49,1
Why these just coming to
light?" TJtheEditor.


17
0:0:49,1 --> 0:0:53,33
Well, we're just adding
to the discussion.


18
0:0:53,33 --> 0:0:55,38
People want to hear about
tardigrades, they want to hear


19
0:0:55,38 --> 0:0:56,0
about space.


20
0:0:56,0 --> 0:1:0,41
And any time you talk about this
type of topic, it spurs


21
0:1:0,41 --> 0:1:4,67
interest because we all want
to know how we got here.


22
0:1:4,67 --> 0:1:10,9
So let me talk about some of
the science versus religion


23
0:1:10,9 --> 0:1:13,9
comments, I think that
might be interesting.


24
0:1:13,9 --> 0:1:17,22
Jubba explains that the
purpose "of life is to


25
0:1:17,22 --> 0:1:21,42
propagate itself." Hm,
there's an idea.


26
0:1:21,42 --> 0:1:28,28
And chickenfingers123, he
clarifies entropy theory


27
0:1:28,28 --> 0:1:30,92
verses the biblical
age of the earth.


28
0:1:30,92 --> 0:1:35,45
For me, there's really only
one question about the


29
0:1:35,45 --> 0:1:39,71
universe and its origins,
and that is why is


30
0:1:39,71 --> 0:1:41,2
there anything at all?


31
0:1:41,2 --> 0:1:45,87
In other words, why is there
something rather than nothing?


32
0:1:45,87 --> 0:1:49,66
And by nothing, I don't mean
vacuum, or space--


33
0:1:49,66 --> 0:1:51,18
I mean nothing.


34
0:1:51,18 --> 0:1:56,9
So just think about that for
a second, let it sink in.


35
0:1:56,9 --> 0:1:57,21
There is something--


36
0:1:57,21 --> 0:2:0,13
there's matter, there's us,
there's conversation, there's


37
0:2:0,13 --> 0:2:1,28
stars and galaxies.


38
0:2:1,28 --> 0:2:6,43
Why is there something rather
than nothing at all?


39
0:2:6,43 --> 0:2:11,63
All of the great religions, they
all at least attempt to


40
0:2:11,63 --> 0:2:14,26
tell us why there
is something.


41
0:2:14,26 --> 0:2:18,84
Religion tells us why,
science tells us how.


42
0:2:18,84 --> 0:2:21,93
"The dangerous tests on these
animals disgusts me.


43
0:2:21,93 --> 0:2:25,65
Tardigrades need rights,
too." And that was


44
0:2:25,65 --> 0:2:27,83
answered "I know, right?


45
0:2:27,83 --> 0:2:33,55



46
0:2:33,55 --> 0:2:35,87
Maybe tardigrades don't want
to be subjected to extreme


47
0:2:35,87 --> 0:2:38,343
temperatures and being
tossed in space!"


48
0:2:38,343 --> 0:2:40,5
You know what?


49
0:2:40,5 --> 0:2:41,29
You're onto something here.


50
0:2:41,29 --> 0:2:43,6
I don't think they want
that at all, no.


51
0:2:43,6 --> 0:2:45,26
I can't tell you what
they do want, but


52
0:2:45,26 --> 0:2:46,89
they don't want that.


53
0:2:46,89 --> 0:2:51,31
Now, just keep one thing in
mind, that tardigrades go into


54
0:2:51,31 --> 0:2:55,1
kind of a suspended animation
called cryptobiosis, and they


55
0:2:55,1 --> 0:2:56,18
probably don't feel a thing.


56
0:2:56,18 --> 0:2:59,56
So they don't care whether
they're being subjected to


57
0:2:59,56 --> 0:3:2,11
x-rays and vacuum
and radiation.


58
0:3:2,11 --> 0:3:5,6
To them, it's just like
another hot day.


59
0:3:5,6 --> 0:3:7,32
Here's a good one.


60
0:3:7,32 --> 0:3:11,22
"If students consistently come
late to class, it will


61
0:3:11,22 --> 0:3:15,93
detrimentally affect
their tardy grade."


62
0:3:15,93 --> 0:3:17,31
Love that, love that.


63
0:3:17,31 --> 0:3:20,63
One million monologues, you have
a good sense of humor.


64
0:3:20,63 --> 0:3:23,39
And by the way, I used to be in
the hot dog business, but I


65
0:3:23,39 --> 0:3:25,95
didn't relish it.


66
0:3:25,95 --> 0:3:28,46
One of the questions
was "Why talk about


67
0:3:28,46 --> 0:3:29,78
tardigrades from space?


68
0:3:29,78 --> 0:3:33,88
Evidence shows that they're
related to earth creatures."


69
0:3:33,88 --> 0:3:35,77
That's from Philip Hedden.


70
0:3:35,77 --> 0:3:40,57
That's a great question, because
that's very true.


71
0:3:40,57 --> 0:3:43,19
Most of the evidence, especially
DNA evidence which


72
0:3:43,19 --> 0:3:47,29
we have now and we didn't have
in the past, shows that


73
0:3:47,29 --> 0:3:50,97
they're either related to
Arthropods, Nematodes, which


74
0:3:50,97 --> 0:3:52,42
are those little round worms.


75
0:3:52,42 --> 0:3:55,28
Arthropods would be
ticks and water


76
0:3:55,28 --> 0:3:56,9
mites, little tiny creatures.


77
0:3:56,9 --> 0:3:58,92
So they probably are related to


78
0:3:58,92 --> 0:4:0,66
creatures that are on earth.


79
0:4:0,66 --> 0:4:6,96
So the question is, again, did
tardigrades come from space?


80
0:4:6,96 --> 0:4:11,76
If there was a fragment of DNA
that arrived here on a comet


81
0:4:11,76 --> 0:4:16,75
or a meteor and that evolved
into all life, including


82
0:4:16,75 --> 0:4:20,31
tardigrades, then yeah,
tardigrades came from space.


83
0:4:20,31 --> 0:4:24,46
So that's one way
to look at it.


84
0:4:24,46 --> 0:4:28,54
OK, one nice comment which, I
don't know how it was meant,


85
0:4:28,54 --> 0:4:31,62
but I know how I took it.


86
0:4:31,62 --> 0:4:34,86
Danielvincentkelley made
a rather long comment.


87
0:4:34,86 --> 0:4:37,58
And at the end he said "Dude
should have a job packing


88
0:4:37,58 --> 0:4:39,31
vans."


89
0:4:39,31 --> 0:4:43,7
Well, I don't know if he meant
that to be insulting or not.


90
0:4:43,7 --> 0:4:46,26
If he was insulting me,
I'm not insulted.


91
0:4:46,26 --> 0:4:48,64
I think probably he might
have been insulting


92
0:4:48,64 --> 0:4:50,51
people who pack bags.


93
0:4:50,51 --> 0:4:57,96
And this is a really good
comment that hits home.


94
0:4:57,96 --> 0:5:1,97
Because I think, again, it
comes back to acceptance.


95
0:5:1,97 --> 0:5:6,94
And whatever we do in jobs or in
our life, if we can accept


96
0:5:6,94 --> 0:5:11,92
it we'll find that there's a lot
more happiness involved.


97
0:5:11,92 --> 0:5:13,85
And it really doesn't matter
what you do when you're in a


98
0:5:13,85 --> 0:5:15,15
state of acceptance.


99
0:5:15,15 --> 0:5:18,79
That just about wraps it up in
terms of responding to most of


100
0:5:18,79 --> 0:5:19,96
the comments that I could.


101
0:5:19,96 --> 0:5:22,74
And I would just like to say
that I really appreciate the


102
0:5:22,74 --> 0:5:25,17
feedback and the interaction.


103
0:5:25,17 --> 0:5:28,55
I just want to thank you again,
all of you, for that.


104
0:5:28,55 --> 0:5:30,43
And I look forward to seeing
you again sometime.


105
0:5:30,43 --> 0:7:30,43
