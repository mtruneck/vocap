###6 [slow electric guitar riff music] KID PRESIDENT>>The world needs to stop being
###15 boring. Yeah, you!
###16 Boring is easy, everybody can be boring. But you're gooder than that.
###20 Life is not a game people. Life isn't a cereal either. Well, it is a cereal.
###25 And if life is a game, aren't we all on the same team?
###31 I mean really right? I'm on your team, be on my team.
###35 This is life people, you've got air coming through your nose!
###38 You've got a heart beat! That means it's time to do somethin'!
###42 A poem. "Two roads diverged in the woods...
###46 and I took the road less traveled... AND IT HURT MAN!
###50 Really bad. Rocks!
###51 Thorns! Glass!
###52 My pants broke! NOT COOL ROBERT FROST!
###53 But what if there really were two paths? I want to be on the one that leads to awesome.
###64 It's like that dude Journey said, don't stop believing, unless your dream is stupid. Then
###71 you should get a better dream. I think that's how it goes.
###74 Get a better dream, then keep goin', and goin', and keep goin'.
###78 What if Michael Jordan had quit? Well, he did quit. But he retired, yeah that's it,
###84 he retired. But before that? In highschool? What if he quit when he didn't make the team?
###87 He would have never made Space Jam. And I love Space Jam.
###93 What will be your Space Jam? What will you create when you make the world awesome?
###99 Nothing if you keep sittin' there! This is why I'm talking to you today!
###104 This is your time. This is my time.
###106 This is our time. We can make everyday better for each other.
###108 If we're all on the same team, let's start acting like it. We've got work to do.
###114 We can cry about it, or we can dance about it.
###118 You were made to be awesome. Let's get out there!
###125 I don't know everything, I'm just a kid, but I do know this:
