1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:16,84



2
0:0:16,84 --> 0:0:21,4
PAT DUFFY: Yeah, man, a long-ass
time ago I guess Gonz


3
0:0:21,4 --> 0:0:22,25
was doing an interview
at Thrasher.


4
0:0:22,25 --> 0:0:23,82
And he was like--


5
0:0:23,82 --> 0:0:24,935
they were like, who do
you think's good?


6
0:0:24,935 --> 0:0:26,94
And he's like well,
I don't know.


7
0:0:26,94 --> 0:0:29,53
He's like, too bad Duffy doesn't
skate anymore, 'cause


8
0:0:29,53 --> 0:0:30,78
he used to be good.


9
0:0:30,78 --> 0:0:32,9



10
0:0:32,9 --> 0:0:34,86
This was a long time ago,
too, when I was


11
0:0:34,86 --> 0:0:37,53
totally still skating.


12
0:0:37,53 --> 0:0:39,27
And then he goes, you know
what he should do?


13
0:0:39,27 --> 0:0:40,42
He should get on a
board like this.


14
0:0:40,42 --> 0:0:41,65
I'm gonna leave it here.


15
0:0:41,65 --> 0:0:44,99
And then I just happened to be
at Thrasher, and Jake's like,


16
0:0:44,99 --> 0:0:47,84
hey, Mark left this for you.


17
0:0:47,84 --> 0:0:49,17
Take it.


18
0:0:49,17 --> 0:0:49,94
I was like, really?


19
0:0:49,94 --> 0:0:52,2
That's really strange.


20
0:0:52,2 --> 0:0:53,19
I was so psyched though.


21
0:0:53,19 --> 0:0:56,72
I went and shot an ad on it
and stuff for playback.


22
0:0:56,72 --> 0:0:59,32
MALE SPEAKER 1: Who owns the
footage of you trying the--


23
0:0:59,32 --> 0:1:0,63
where you hurt your knee?


24
0:1:0,63 --> 0:1:2,81
PAT DUFFY: I have
that right here.


25
0:1:2,81 --> 0:1:4,44
I have one right here
on my iPod.


26
0:1:4,44 --> 0:1:7,84
It was already used on that
fucking stupid MTV show.


27
0:1:7,84 --> 0:1:21,94



28
0:1:21,94 --> 0:1:23,886
[GROAN]


29
0:1:23,886 --> 0:1:25,7
It sucks.


30
0:1:25,7 --> 0:1:27,71
Ouch, that hurt.


31
0:1:27,71 --> 0:1:29,5
I worked out today man.


32
0:1:29,5 --> 0:1:31,49
It's coming back.


33
0:1:31,49 --> 0:1:33,9
It's getting real strong man.


34
0:1:33,9 --> 0:1:34,11
I'm so psyched.


35
0:1:34,11 --> 0:1:37,15
I'm so embarrassed that
I did that show.


36
0:1:37,15 --> 0:1:39,97
There was like roller bladers
on my episode and shit.


37
0:1:39,97 --> 0:1:42,49
Like, I told them I've
done this for a


38
0:1:42,49 --> 0:1:43,85
career for 15 years.


39
0:1:43,85 --> 0:1:46,92
Don't lump me in with some kid
from Bakersfield who is a


40
0:1:46,92 --> 0:1:50,51
backyard wrestler for fun.


41
0:1:50,51 --> 0:1:52,94
Forget it, dude.


42
0:1:52,94 --> 0:1:54,18
PATRICK O'DELL: Hi, welcome
back to the show.


43
0:1:54,18 --> 0:1:56,52
This episode is about
Pat Duffy.


44
0:1:56,52 --> 0:1:58,68
I just remember when
"Questionable" came out.


45
0:1:58,68 --> 0:1:59,53
I had never heard of him.


46
0:1:59,53 --> 0:2:3,16
Nobody had ever heard of him,
and his part was one of the


47
0:2:3,16 --> 0:2:5,7
best skate parts in years.


48
0:2:5,7 --> 0:2:9,28
Pat was probably the first
hand rail pro.


49
0:2:9,28 --> 0:2:10,63
He was doing things that people


50
0:2:10,63 --> 0:2:11,9
didn't think were possible.


51
0:2:11,9 --> 0:2:15,46
Plan B was created as kind of a
super team to have the best


52
0:2:15,46 --> 0:2:19,56
people from every genre
of skateboarding.


53
0:2:19,56 --> 0:2:24,64
I think Mike Ternasky set this
template, this Plan B formula,


54
0:2:24,64 --> 0:2:27,98
that I see a lot of companies
now like Zero and Baker.


55
0:2:27,98 --> 0:2:30,43
You can see it all took
Plan B's lead.


56
0:2:30,43 --> 0:2:34,82
SAL BARBIER: The first time I
heard about Pat Duffy was,


57
0:2:34,82 --> 0:2:37,78
man, that was a long time ago.


58
0:2:37,78 --> 0:2:42,66
Ternasky, Mike Ternasky, was
talking about this new guy


59
0:2:42,66 --> 0:2:46,46
that he had found that lived
in Marin County.


60
0:2:46,46 --> 0:2:49,25
He was coming out, and he was
filming, and he was doing a


61
0:2:49,25 --> 0:2:51,55
lot of really impressive
things.


62
0:2:51,55 --> 0:2:54,58
So we knew that he
was going to be a


63
0:2:54,58 --> 0:2:56,2
professional right away.


64
0:2:56,2 --> 0:2:59,7
PAT DUFFY: I had flown down just
to see if I would fit in


65
0:2:59,7 --> 0:3:0,13
on the team, you know?


66
0:3:0,13 --> 0:3:1,38
Whatever.


67
0:3:1,38 --> 0:3:5,432



68
0:3:5,432 --> 0:3:6,89
Yeah.


69
0:3:6,89 --> 0:3:9,8
Well, Carroll I knew already
because I had-- you remember


70
0:3:9,8 --> 0:3:12,36
in "Hokus Pokus" the Hensley
balance beam that they used to


71
0:3:12,36 --> 0:3:13,97
skate at School W?


72
0:3:13,97 --> 0:3:15,96
I had one of those,
a portable one.


73
0:3:15,96 --> 0:3:18,45
So people used to come skate
that thing from everywhere.


74
0:3:18,45 --> 0:3:22,4
Carroll brothers would come
skate, Danny Sargent, Henry,


75
0:3:22,4 --> 0:3:25,16
and then I had a ramp
in my yard too.


76
0:3:25,16 --> 0:3:29,34
So I'd known those
dudes, you know?


77
0:3:29,34 --> 0:3:33,0
But it was intimidating to go
hang out with Danny Way.


78
0:3:33,0 --> 0:3:35,72
I was like 17 years old.


79
0:3:35,72 --> 0:3:40,4
My point of view coming from
watching him and Colin in


80
0:3:40,4 --> 0:3:43,22
videos growing up.


81
0:3:43,22 --> 0:3:44,54
And then NT just going,
hey you're


82
0:3:44,54 --> 0:3:45,98
staying at Danny's house.


83
0:3:45,98 --> 0:3:46,6
Go with him.


84
0:3:46,6 --> 0:3:51,366
And I'm just like all
right, OK, whatever.


85
0:3:51,366 --> 0:3:52,29
-I can't do it.


86
0:3:52,29 --> 0:3:53,54
I can't do it.


87
0:3:53,54 --> 0:3:55,282



88
0:3:55,282 --> 0:3:57,23
Ow, fuck!


89
0:3:57,23 --> 0:4:0,64



90
0:4:0,64 --> 0:4:2,31
Fuck, I'm bleeding.


91
0:4:2,31 --> 0:4:3,2
There's blood.


92
0:4:3,2 --> 0:4:5,52
Let me give you the theory
of Pat, Taylor.


93
0:4:5,52 --> 0:4:7,85
You see Pat, Pat is actually
a terminator.


94
0:4:7,85 --> 0:4:12,2



95
0:4:12,2 --> 0:4:14,14
PAT DUFFY: We filmed for like
three weeks every day.


96
0:4:14,14 --> 0:4:15,52
They were just staying at
my house when I went


97
0:4:15,52 --> 0:4:17,202
to school and shit.


98
0:4:17,202 --> 0:4:19,399
MALE SPEAKER 1: Where was that
school yard with the big rail?


99
0:4:19,399 --> 0:4:22,792
PAT DUFFY: That was at San
Pasqual in San Diego.


100
0:4:22,792 --> 0:4:23,49
MALE SPEAKER 1: You
did it twice?


101
0:4:23,49 --> 0:4:24,606
PAT DUFFY: Yeah, twice.


102
0:4:24,606 --> 0:4:26,31
MALE SPEAKER 1: Why'd
you do it twice?


103
0:4:26,31 --> 0:4:27,52
PAT DUFFY: Think we were
thinking different angle.


104
0:4:27,52 --> 0:4:28,95
And I was like, sure.


105
0:4:28,95 --> 0:4:30,4
You know, one from the top
one from the bottom.


106
0:4:30,4 --> 0:4:32,26
We didn't have two cameras.


107
0:4:32,26 --> 0:4:34,67
It was just Mike filming.


108
0:4:34,67 --> 0:4:35,916
MALE SPEAKER 1: But I remember
at the time when that came out


109
0:4:35,916 --> 0:4:38,58
too, thinking that you couldn't
grind a round bar.


110
0:4:38,58 --> 0:4:41,11
What made you think you could
grind a round bar?


111
0:4:41,11 --> 0:4:42,98
PAT DUFFY: Because, I don't
know, I had that balance beam


112
0:4:42,98 --> 0:4:43,28
growing up.


113
0:4:43,28 --> 0:4:46,26
I just got comfortable grinding


114
0:4:46,26 --> 0:4:48,18
metal rails, you know?


115
0:4:48,18 --> 0:4:48,396
I don't know.


116
0:4:48,396 --> 0:4:51,8
I just liked doing
that at the time.


117
0:4:51,8 --> 0:4:53,52
Just kind of scaring myself.


118
0:4:53,52 --> 0:4:57,33
I literally lost my mind
back smithing that


119
0:4:57,33 --> 0:4:59,89
kinked rail at SF State.


120
0:4:59,89 --> 0:5:2,59
Because I knew I could do it
and I just wasn't doing it.


121
0:5:2,59 --> 0:5:6,1
MALE SPEAKER 1: Did you know
that the Plan B video would be


122
0:5:6,1 --> 0:5:7,27
as big of a deal as it was?


123
0:5:7,27 --> 0:5:8,53
PAT DUFFY: I mean,
I don't really.


124
0:5:8,53 --> 0:5:11,98
I mean, of course you knew it
was because you knew it was


125
0:5:11,98 --> 0:5:13,8
going to be something crazy.


126
0:5:13,8 --> 0:5:15,93
Because we would see the footage
going down and there


127
0:5:15,93 --> 0:5:16,89
was nothing.


128
0:5:16,89 --> 0:5:20,43
You know, Ternasky made it
a point that we knew what


129
0:5:20,43 --> 0:5:21,37
everyone else was doing.


130
0:5:21,37 --> 0:5:22,92
So that we could feed
off of it, you know?


131
0:5:22,92 --> 0:5:27,23
He'd always call every day and
be like, yep Rick did this.


132
0:5:27,23 --> 0:5:28,2
Carroll, got this.


133
0:5:28,2 --> 0:5:31,7
And you'd just get so psyched.


134
0:5:31,7 --> 0:5:34,86
He's one of my favorite
skaters of all time.


135
0:5:34,86 --> 0:5:38,87
I would rather watch fucking
Carroll do a back T on a ledge


136
0:5:38,87 --> 0:5:44,74
than some dude jump down a 30
stair trying to kick flip it.


137
0:5:44,74 --> 0:5:47,2
His whole style is
like so sick.


138
0:5:47,2 --> 0:5:48,78
JAKE ROSENBERG: I mean, when I
started working for Plan B,


139
0:5:48,78 --> 0:5:50,5
Pat's part was already done.


140
0:5:50,5 --> 0:5:53,12
That was kind of how it
was set up, you know?


141
0:5:53,12 --> 0:5:55,53
Which I think Mike strategically
did to get


142
0:5:55,53 --> 0:5:57,34
everyone fired up
for the video.


143
0:5:57,34 --> 0:6:0,14
To have this amazing part and
then have everyone doing their


144
0:6:0,14 --> 0:6:1,69
own part after that.


145
0:6:1,69 --> 0:6:4,59
And you know, imagine being Mike
Carroll and coming down


146
0:6:4,59 --> 0:6:7,43
to this new company, Plan B,
and see Pat Duffy's part.


147
0:6:7,43 --> 0:6:10,5
And having Mike put your arm
around and say, you're my top


148
0:6:10,5 --> 0:6:11,48
street pro.


149
0:6:11,48 --> 0:6:12,95
Come on!


150
0:6:12,95 --> 0:6:14,41
How could you be super stoked?


151
0:6:14,41 --> 0:6:16,14
It's like, fuck.


152
0:6:16,14 --> 0:6:19,66
MIKE CARROLL: I mean when we
first got Plan B started, it


153
0:6:19,66 --> 0:6:22,76
was like this whole
awesome thing.


154
0:6:22,76 --> 0:6:25,74
And then it seemed like there's
a little bit of--


155
0:6:25,74 --> 0:6:28,8
not tension, but--


156
0:6:28,8 --> 0:6:29,98
I don't know.


157
0:6:29,98 --> 0:6:33,8
Just people had different
ideas.


158
0:6:33,8 --> 0:6:34,54
You know?


159
0:6:34,54 --> 0:6:37,83
Like all of a sudden, it's like
I have to learn a trick.


160
0:6:37,83 --> 0:6:40,58
Not like ah, it'd be cool
to learn a trick.


161
0:6:40,58 --> 0:6:45,41
JAKE ROSENBERG: So Mike and I
were doing this voice-over for


162
0:6:45,41 --> 0:6:46,78
this project.


163
0:6:46,78 --> 0:6:49,53
He's like, dude do you have
that old first version of


164
0:6:49,53 --> 0:6:51,632
"Questionable" with
Gonz in it?


165
0:6:51,632 --> 0:6:52,59
I was like, what are
you talking about?


166
0:6:52,59 --> 0:6:53,7
He's like remember?


167
0:6:53,7 --> 0:6:56,1
He was at the Pal contest, and
we had the trick of him.


168
0:6:56,1 --> 0:6:59,8
And he called Mike Ternasky and
told him to take it out?


169
0:6:59,8 --> 0:7:0,81
And I was like, what?


170
0:7:0,81 --> 0:7:2,72
Gonz did that?


171
0:7:2,72 --> 0:7:7,951
And then I vividly remembered
Mike being really bummed.


172
0:7:7,951 --> 0:7:8,44
You know?


173
0:7:8,44 --> 0:7:11,3
Because I think that just the
way that Mike approached


174
0:7:11,3 --> 0:7:13,19
skateboarding, a lot of


175
0:7:13,19 --> 0:7:15,48
skateboarders didn't like that.


176
0:7:15,48 --> 0:7:19,86
But I know, that in his heart,
he loved skateboarding.


177
0:7:19,86 --> 0:7:21,73
So I think it's kind of
heartbreaking when you think


178
0:7:21,73 --> 0:7:25,53
you're doing something for the
better good of something and


179
0:7:25,53 --> 0:7:26,78
someone else doesn't.


180
0:7:26,78 --> 0:7:29,36



181
0:7:29,36 --> 0:7:33,4
Mike did amazing things
while he was alive.


182
0:7:33,4 --> 0:7:36,36
I'm not just saying that
because he's dead.


183
0:7:36,36 --> 0:7:37,286
MALE SPEAKER 2 (OFFSCREEN):
Get down, boy.


184
0:7:37,286 --> 0:7:38,12
PAT DUFFY (OFFSCREEN)
Thanks, bro.


185
0:7:38,12 --> 0:7:39,88
-You know I could have
did better man.


186
0:7:39,88 --> 0:7:40,54
-I believe you.


187
0:7:40,54 --> 0:7:40,79
-That was tough.


188
0:7:40,79 --> 0:7:41,84
Man, I like that.


189
0:7:41,84 --> 0:7:42,815
What kind of wheels you got?


190
0:7:42,815 --> 0:7:43,1
-Little one--


191
0:7:43,1 --> 0:7:43,935
MALE SPEAKER 3 (OFFSCREEN):
What do you got


192
0:7:43,935 --> 0:7:44,895
to say about that?


193
0:7:44,895 --> 0:7:48,9
-The only thing I got
to say is look here.


194
0:7:48,9 --> 0:7:49,57
The guy's a natural.


195
0:7:49,57 --> 0:7:50,92
He's a natural.


196
0:7:50,92 --> 0:7:51,7
And you know something?


197
0:7:51,7 --> 0:7:52,996
When you want to make a million
dollars, hey, you come


198
0:7:52,996 --> 0:7:54,365
and look for me.


199
0:7:54,365 --> 0:7:57,645
You look for the baby, because
the baby knows a natural.


200
0:7:57,645 --> 0:8:0,1
Hey, come on, hold
it up there.


201
0:8:0,1 --> 0:8:1,2
Show them who's number one.


202
0:8:1,2 --> 0:8:3,28
Show them who's number one.


203
0:8:3,28 --> 0:8:4,83
-That was great man.


204
0:8:4,83 --> 0:8:5,975
That was great.


205
0:8:5,975 --> 0:8:6,96
That was great.


206
0:8:6,96 --> 0:8:10,746
I especially liked the
flip of the board.


207
0:8:10,746 --> 0:8:11,42
That was cool.


208
0:8:11,42 --> 0:8:13,46
I can't jump that high.


209
0:8:13,46 --> 0:8:16,29
My vertical leap is only about
an inch, if that high.


210
0:8:16,29 --> 0:8:17,177
MALE SPEAKER 3 (OFFSCREEN)
Take it easy.


211
0:8:17,177 --> 0:8:17,644
MALE SPEAKER 4 (OFFSCREEN):
Yeah, right on, man.


212
0:8:17,644 --> 0:8:19,512
Have a good trip now.


213
0:8:19,512 --> 0:8:19,98
PAT DUFFY: What's that?


214
0:8:19,98 --> 0:8:22,6
MALE SPEAKER 1: It seemed like
those two, "Virtual Reality"


215
0:8:22,6 --> 0:8:24,312
came out almost-- to me it
seemed like immediately.


216
0:8:24,312 --> 0:8:25,79
I guess it was a year later?


217
0:8:25,79 --> 0:8:27,9
PAT DUFFY: It was a
year later, yeah.


218
0:8:27,9 --> 0:8:28,94
MALE SPEAKER 1: That's
pretty fast now.


219
0:8:28,94 --> 0:8:30,58
PAT DUFFY: For now a days,
people sit on them for a


220
0:8:30,58 --> 0:8:32,5
couple years now.


221
0:8:32,5 --> 0:8:33,85
It was different.


222
0:8:33,85 --> 0:8:36,14
It was just a different vibe
back then though, because no


223
0:8:36,14 --> 0:8:37,57
one really made any money.


224
0:8:37,57 --> 0:8:39,7
It was like you were
still kind of--


225
0:8:39,7 --> 0:8:43,299
you were still just like
skating all the time.


226
0:8:43,299 --> 0:8:47,73
There was a while white rail lip
slide that went down flat.


227
0:8:47,73 --> 0:8:49,74
That took a couple times because
I kept sticking on it


228
0:8:49,74 --> 0:8:51,67
and I had to set up
a slick bottom.


229
0:8:51,67 --> 0:8:53,49
Jake Rosenberg filmed
that one.


230
0:8:53,49 --> 0:8:55,64
JAKE ROSENBERG: I mean, Pat's
fucking first video part's one


231
0:8:55,64 --> 0:8:57,45
of the greatest video parts in
the history of skateboarding.


232
0:8:57,45 --> 0:8:59,26
And it's like, who the
fuck is this kid?


233
0:8:59,26 --> 0:9:1,3
I've never seen it before.


234
0:9:1,3 --> 0:9:3,2
And he didn't exactly have
a sophomore jinx.


235
0:9:3,2 --> 0:9:5,34
I mean, I think his "Virtual
Reality" part is equally as


236
0:9:5,34 --> 0:9:6,267
impressive.


237
0:9:6,267 --> 0:9:9,497
MALE SPEAKER 1: When a lot of
those guys left to do their


238
0:9:9,497 --> 0:9:11,24
own, did you take
that personally?


239
0:9:11,24 --> 0:9:13,45
PAT DUFFY: No, I didn't take
it personally at all.


240
0:9:13,45 --> 0:9:17,85
I figured they had
their reasons.


241
0:9:17,85 --> 0:9:18,76
JAKE ROSENBERG: You know
what, that's what Mike


242
0:9:18,76 --> 0:9:19,77
Carroll told me.


243
0:9:19,77 --> 0:9:22,26
And this, I think we have to
explore at another time.


244
0:9:22,26 --> 0:9:27,31
But he was like, we knew we were
leaving the company long


245
0:9:27,31 --> 0:9:29,16
before we did.


246
0:9:29,16 --> 0:9:31,62
And that's why we had
the Friends section.


247
0:9:31,62 --> 0:9:33,5
It's because we knew there
was never going to


248
0:9:33,5 --> 0:9:34,12
be a "Blind" video.


249
0:9:34,12 --> 0:9:36,32
PAT DUFFY: But I did get a call
from Rick saying, this is


250
0:9:36,32 --> 0:9:36,94
what we're doing.


251
0:9:36,94 --> 0:9:41,81
And we want you to know that
this is what we're doing.


252
0:9:41,81 --> 0:9:45,9
And then you can make a decision
on your own what


253
0:9:45,9 --> 0:9:46,6
you're going to do.


254
0:9:46,6 --> 0:9:49,87
Which I thought was pretty cool
of them just to let me


255
0:9:49,87 --> 0:9:52,21
know what was happening
that day.


256
0:9:52,21 --> 0:9:54,73
Like the day they showed
up with all the "Girl"


257
0:9:54,73 --> 0:9:56,36
shirts on, you know.


258
0:9:56,36 --> 0:9:57,91
MIKE CARROLL: The way we
did it was crazy but--


259
0:9:57,91 --> 0:10:0,375
MALE SPEAKER 1: Just all at
once take half the team.


260
0:10:0,375 --> 0:10:3,5
MIKE CARROLL: Yeah, and not tell
anyone and didn't give


261
0:10:3,5 --> 0:10:4,946
any notice or anything.


262
0:10:4,946 --> 0:10:8,99
But if you know how powerful
World or Rocco or any of those


263
0:10:8,99 --> 0:10:10,51
dudes were back then?


264
0:10:10,51 --> 0:10:14,52
If we tried to let them know,
we would never have even


265
0:10:14,52 --> 0:10:19,21
existed because they would
have never let it happen.


266
0:10:19,21 --> 0:10:21,6
PAT DUFFY: Just because that
happened didn't really faze me


267
0:10:21,6 --> 0:10:23,65
on turning my back on MT.


268
0:10:23,65 --> 0:10:30,62
Just because he kind of took
me in as one of those kids.


269
0:10:30,62 --> 0:10:32,97
JAKE ROSENBERG: He looked at all
those guys like his kids.


270
0:10:32,97 --> 0:10:36,46
Again, regardless of how he did
business and regardless of


271
0:10:36,46 --> 0:10:40,11
how people saw him in
a certain capacity.


272
0:10:40,11 --> 0:10:44,13
He cared tremendously for
everyone who skated for him.


273
0:10:44,13 --> 0:10:47,92
And I think he took pride in
giving them an opportunity, or


274
0:10:47,92 --> 0:10:50,55
promoting them, to
be great skaters.


275
0:10:50,55 --> 0:10:54,21
So Mike died May 17th, 1994.


276
0:10:54,21 --> 0:10:56,6
I went down to San Diego
for the funeral.


277
0:10:56,6 --> 0:10:58,82
I remember seeing Danny outside
the funeral home where


278
0:10:58,82 --> 0:11:0,29
they were having the
viewing for Mike.


279
0:11:0,29 --> 0:11:3,25
Which was like the worst
idea to go there.


280
0:11:3,25 --> 0:11:6,9
But Danny was just crying.


281
0:11:6,9 --> 0:11:9,86
And like, Danny was crying
because he was devastated.


282
0:11:9,86 --> 0:11:11,15
PAT DUFFY: I don't know, he was
just kind of like a second


283
0:11:11,15 --> 0:11:13,578
dad for me.


284
0:11:13,578 --> 0:11:16,513
I just appreciated everything
he taught me.


285
0:11:16,513 --> 0:11:18,445
MALE SPEAKER 1: And so then when
Plan B ended did you know


286
0:11:18,445 --> 0:11:21,83
where you were going
to go after that?


287
0:11:21,83 --> 0:11:24,8
PAT DUFFY: No.


288
0:11:24,8 --> 0:11:25,95
MALE SPEAKER 1: These are
all think boards?


289
0:11:25,95 --> 0:11:28,295
PAT DUFFY: Yeah, I was going
through them the other day and


290
0:11:28,295 --> 0:11:31,316
I was like, damn, man I must
have been raging when I lived


291
0:11:31,316 --> 0:11:33,11
in San Francisco.


292
0:11:33,11 --> 0:11:36,6
They're all booze graphics.


293
0:11:36,6 --> 0:11:37,18
All of them.


294
0:11:37,18 --> 0:11:38,99
It's crazy.


295
0:11:38,99 --> 0:11:42,49
Gabe Morford and I grew
up together, you know.


296
0:11:42,49 --> 0:11:45,57
I was hanging out with Gabe, and
he was going out with this


297
0:11:45,57 --> 0:11:47,28
full deluxe staff.


298
0:11:47,28 --> 0:11:49,92
So he was going out
with everybody.


299
0:11:49,92 --> 0:11:50,2
I don't know.


300
0:11:50,2 --> 0:11:54,64
I was back in San Francisco,
you know?


301
0:11:54,64 --> 0:11:56,66
And I was just hanging out
with skateboarders again.


302
0:11:56,66 --> 0:11:59,738



303
0:11:59,738 --> 0:12:1,78
JAKE ROSENBERG: You know, 14
years later or whatever, I


304
0:12:1,78 --> 0:12:3,15
look back on that time now.


305
0:12:3,15 --> 0:12:3,86
And I'm like, holy shit.


306
0:12:3,86 --> 0:12:7,2
I was involved, in my opinion,
in like some of the greatest


307
0:12:7,2 --> 0:12:8,63
videos in the history
of skating.


308
0:12:8,63 --> 0:12:13,6
When skateboarding was dead,
Plan B reinvigorated it.


309
0:12:13,6 --> 0:12:16,46
Whether it caused people to
revolt against it or it caused


310
0:12:16,46 --> 0:12:21,17
people to do more technical
better tricks, Plan B was at


311
0:12:21,17 --> 0:12:22,94
the epicenter of what changed
skateboarding.


312
0:12:22,94 --> 0:14:22,94
