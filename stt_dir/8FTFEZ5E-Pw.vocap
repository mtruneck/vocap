###7 ALICE ROBERTS: They say this is where it all began.
###13 That we are all children of Africa.
###20 But if so, why do we look so different?
###26 And how on earth could a handful of African families
###30 become a whole world full of people?
###45 I'm Alice Roberts, medical doctor and anthropologist.
###50 I'm fascinated by what bones, stones,
###55 and even our bodies can reveal about the distant past.
###61 I'm going in search of the traces left by our African ancestors
###65 and their journeys to populate the world.
###69 This time, the most challenging journey yet..
###72 Asia.
###75 Could people out of Africa really have conquered its frozen wastes?
###80 I don't think I've ever been so cold.
###82 And did the journey cause a change in the way people look?
###89 or have I got it completely wrong?
###92 I'm going to investigate an astonishing idea
###95 that the Chinese could be descended from a different branch of the human family
###100 to the rest of us.
###105 Come with me in the footsteps of our ancestors,
###108 on the most epic adventure ever undertaken.
###129 ROBERTS: Siberia, north of the Arctic Circle.
###132 I'm going to meet one of the most remote peoples on Earth
###136 to help solve a mystery.
###138 Why would our ancestors have ever ventured into such a wilderness?
###146 We're flying over vast expanses of ice and snow,
###150 but I'm getting very close to my destination now.
###156 I'm heading deep into Asia,
###158 5,000 kilometres east of Moscow
###161 to the small town of olenek.
###175 I've come to meet the Evenki.
###181 These people are the closest I can get
###183 to the humans I think first conquered these lands.
###196 I've arrived on a special day.
###198 It's the annual reindeer festival.
###201 (PEOPLE CHEERING)
###207 These animals have been vital to the people of Siberia
###211 for as long as anyone can remember.
###221 That's one lost his seat.
###235 People have come to this festival
###237 from an area the size of Britain and France put together,
###240 to race their reindeer on the frozen river.
###242 But it's also an opportunity
###244 for the people that live so scattered across this landscape to come together.
###252 ROBERTS: How our ancestors first came to these cold lands,
###256 and then survived here, is a mystery.
###259 So I hope the Evenki can help.
###267 But to find out more, I must leave the festival
###270 and head for one of their remote camps.
###275 It's going to be tough.
###277 It's already minus 26 degrees Celsius,
###280 and they say it could get a lot colder.
###284 I've got layers and layers on here.
###286 There are two, three, four...
###290 five with the coat.
###292 And it's absolutely essential that every bit of my skin is covered,
###296 including my face.
###298 Because if anything is exposed, it will literally freeze.
###305 But it seems that even my finest 2 1 st-century, hi-tech clothing
###310 is no match for the Siberian winter.
###314 Thank you.
###318 My driver is not convinced that this jacket is adequate,
###322 and he's given me a reindeer-fur jacket instead.
###326 I think he might be right, because reindeer fur is amazing.
###329 Each of these outer hairs is actually hollow
###332 and it's got air inside,
###334 so it's fantastic insulation.
###337 And I'm going to be testing it out.
###346 ROBERTS: Wonderful. Amazing stuff.
###359 To start with, the reindeer fur keeps me really warm.
###374 I even have a go at driving myself.
###379 But as the journey goes on, I begin to feel the cold.
###383 And with the wind chill, the temperature drops well below minus 40.
###395 As the hours go by, it gets colder.
###400 I'm starting to lose feeling in my fingers and toes.
###408 Is it really possible that our ancestors survived this cold?
###412 After all, their bodies were not made for this climate.
###418 Because the latest research claims that Siberians, along with most humans,
###423 can trace their origins to a tiny group which left Africa
###427 around 70,000 years ago.
###430 A few family groups could have followed the great rivers north,
###434 around and through the Himalayas.
###436 But we just don't know.
###439 All we have is a few stone tools
###442 suggesting someone had reached Siberia by 40,000 years ago.
###451 What could have driven such a tropical species on deeper into the frozen north?
###462 The last half hour of the journey is the longest I have ever experienced.
###475 After what seems like forever,
###477 the Evenki camp finally appears through the trees.
###490 Oh, God!
###491 I don't think I've ever been so cold in my entire life.
###495 That's a six-hour journey.
###499 I saw some of it, but a lot of it I didn't see,
###502 'cause just look at that.
###503 Nothing at all.
###505 Oh, but we're here.
###508 I'm gonna go and get warm.
###527 ROBERTS: I wake up to find the camp in a fever of activity.
###531 Even in bright sunshine, it's still minus 20.
###535 But I feel privileged to be here.
###539 These Evenki are one of the most isolated peoples in the world.
###543 And this is the first time they've allowed their camps to be filmed.
###550 Well, the question that really leaps out
###552 is why on earth did the ancestors of the Evenki
###554 come this far north?
###556 But the answer is obvious. Hunting.
###559 And in fact, although the Evenki today have herds of domesticated reindeer,
###563 they still depend on the wild animals for their meat.
###567 Just as their ancestors did thousands of years ago.
###571 Well, I'm just about to go off on a reindeer hunt.
###575 So, Vasily, have you got a good feeling about the hunt today?
###578 MALE TRANSLATOR: Well, I feel it's going to be a good day.
###582 But you never can tell.
###588 ROBERTS: vasily Stepanov, the brigadier,
###590 leads what's known as a brigade of Evenki herders and hunters.
###596 We know that people have been hunting in Siberia for a very long time,
###604 because scattered across this vast wilderness
###607 archaeologists have discovered ancient butchered reindeer bones,
###611 and tools carved from their antlers.
###633 MALE TRANSLATOR: You can see all these reindeer tracks.
###635 They passed through and went off in that direction.
###639 over there.
###641 (SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE)
###647 ROBERTS: The brigadier reckons they were here recently, but are moving fast.
###655 After some time tracking,
###657 it becomes clear that he won't catch them today.
###666 But his people still need to eat.
###670 So, reluctantly,
###672 they choose one of their domesticated animals for slaughter.
###690 But now, as far as the Evenki people are concerned, it's...
###694 it's dinner.
###696 And the anatomist in me is quite intrigued
###698 to see how they're going to skin it
###700 and how they're going to cut it up.
###708 ROBERTS: Quite interesting, 'cause they're using the knife
###710 with the blade basically facing outwards
###712 so there's no chance of cutting through the deeper tissues.
###715 And it's almost bloodless. I mean, look at that.
###718 That skin is just peeling away.
###721 ROBERTS: For 40,000 years,
###723 a key to survival in this incredibly harsh environment
###727 has been to use every single bit of the reindeer.
###731 The eyes, liver and brain are delicacies.
###734 The antlers are used to boost male potency.
###737 And that's not all.
###740 MALE TRANSLATOR: Alice, it's like French wine.
###754 (ExCLAIMS)
###756 ROBERTS: But food is only one part of survival.
###761 To withstand this terrible cold,
###763 our ancestors had to come up with something really ingenious.
###769 Well, compared to the hunt, what these ladies are doing here
###772 seems a bit frivolous.
###774 But in fact, it's one of the greatest technological advances
###778 the humankind has ever seen.
###783 ROBERTS: our species wasn't designed for this climate.
###786 Yet somehow, uniquely amongst apes, we made it this far north.
###791 And the secret is right here.
###795 Tanya is measuring me up for my very own pair
###798 of reindeer-skin boots.
###802 FEMALE TRANSLATOR: okay, that's it.
###804 I've got your size. Let's get to work.
###809 There's a very specific part
###811 of the reindeer hide that's being used here.
###814 You can see from the shape of it
###816 that it's the fur from the reindeer's legs
###819 that they use to make boots out of.
###822 ROBERTS: But what happens now is the really important bit.
###827 ROBERTS: And this is it. This amazing technology
###830 that makes survival in this harsh environment possible.
###834 Sewing.
###836 And it all depends on having a needle.
###840 Some of the most ancient needles in the world
###842 are found in Siberia.
###846 ROBERTS: We'll never know who it was
###848 that first thought of carving a needle out of bone.
###852 But the oldest one found dates to around 40,000 years ago.
###866 It's no good having a needle
###868 if you don't have tough thread to sew with.
###870 And that comes from the reindeer, too.
###873 (SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE)
###876 FEMALE TRANSLATOR: I'm using sinew from the body of the reindeer
###879 to make threads for sewing clothes together.
###882 If you use these, it's a very sturdy and long-lasting way of sewing things.
###887 (SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE)
###899 ROBERTS: It's humbling that this apparently simple approach
###902 still beats synthetic clothing today.
###909 Beautiful! Spasibo.
###914 (WOMAN LAUGHING)
###916 ROBERTS: The needle and thread
###918 made the difference between death and survival.
###922 Tailored clothes meant people who originated in the tropics
###926 could now venture further north than any humans before.
###945 That evening, I get an invitation to join the brigadier's family
###950 as they tuck in to the reindeer killed earlier.
###953 And there isn't much else on the menu.
###956 The Evenki's meaty diet may sound unhealthy,
###960 but it boosts the metabolic rate and raises body temperature.
###964 Basically, it makes them feel warmer.
###971 As the evening moves on,
###973 our conversation turns to an eternal question.
###978 Anatoly, do the Evenki have any stories about creation?
###981 About how they came to be here?
###986 MALE TRANSLATOR: A bird called the loon dived three times into the sea.
###990 And only at the third time it brought a bit of mud.
###994 And from that mud, the earth arose.
###996 And then the mammoth came along.
###999 And with its tusks, it raised the earth still further
###1003 and formed the rivers and mountains.
###1005 So this is our beautiful story about the creation of the Earth.
###1029 (CLANGING)
###1032 ROBERTS: I feel I understand
###1034 how our ancestors would have been able to survive here.
###1037 But the consequence of having to follow their food
###1040 would have been an endlessly nomadic lifestyle.
###1047 All this commotion around.
###1049 People are literally packing down their homes and moving off.
###1053 And this is what a nomadic lifestyle is all about.
###1056 These people have to move.
###1057 They have to take their reindeer to new pastures.
###1071 ROBERTS: The only thing the reindeer eat in winter
###1074 is lichen under the snow.
###1076 And they get through it very fast.
###1078 So they're constantly on the move to find more.
###1081 And the humans follow them.
###1084 This is just amazing. We've got this caravan of reindeer sleighs
###1088 carrying everything from the camp.
###1090 And the entire herd, hundreds and hundreds of reindeer,
###1094 are following us.
###1114 ROBERTS: Finally, the reindeer stop, and so do we.
###1117 Everybody joins in to put up the tchum.
###1121 There are so few people around the world who still live like this,
###1125 but once we were all nomads.
###1128 ROBERTS: That's got to go on by itself.
###1138 So what we've seen today is a nomadic lifestyle in action.
###1141 We've seen a whole village being dismantled and moved on.
###1145 And it took about 1 0 minutes to put this tchum up,
###1148 and it's made of large poles and reindeer skin,
###1151 the sort of materials that would have been available
###1153 thousands and thousands of years ago.
###1155 This is a very ancient way of life.
###1160 ROBERTS: And it seems that for over 1 0,000 years
###1163 this life on the move took family groups right across Siberia.
###1169 Recent discoveries tell us that they reached the edge of the Arctic ocean
###1173 nearly 30,000 years ago.
###1179 Humans survived here for thousands of years.
###1186 But then a dramatic turn of events changed their journey through Asia -
###1192 the peak of the Ice Age.
###1197 The latest climate research reveals what happened 25,000 years ago,
###1203 as the Ice Age really took hold.
###1208 In places, the temperature reached as low as minus 80.
###1212 And it became unimaginably dry.
###1216 Such extremes are impossible to survive.
###1223 So what happened to these men, women and children?
###1240 St Petersburg, the former imperial capital of Russia.
###1252 The Hermitage is one of the world's greatest museums,
###1256 home to some of the most celebrated works of art.
###1268 But there's something else here, too.
###1270 It's not on display, but it's every bit as precious.
###1279 Here, in the storerooms,
###1281 are a few objects that could unlock the secrets
###1285 of those Siberian families struggling in the depths of the Ice Age.
###1293 What is really striking about these objects
###1295 from the height of the last Ice Age
###1298 is that they're found in just a few places in the south of Siberia.
###1302 Which is interesting because it suggests that as the climate worsened,
###1306 these prehistoric people retreated into refuges
###1309 where it still would have been very cold,
###1312 but they would have been just able to survive.
###1315 ROBERTS: People vanished from the frozen wastes of northern Siberia,
###1320 to the south.
###1321 one of the refuges they gathered in is now called Mal'ta.
###1328 So can the few remains found here
###1331 tell us anything about what happened?
###1335 Just look at these tiny blades from the Ice Age.
###1339 They are unusually small.
###1341 And the archaeologists think this is because the appalling cold
###1345 made it difficult to reach the quarries,
###1347 so the stone itself was such a precious resource
###1351 that they were using it to its utmost,
###1352 getting as many blades as they could out of it.
###1356 So the blades themselves got smaller and smaller.
###1362 And something extraordinary was happening during this period.
###1366 In spite of that struggle for survival, there was a blossoming of art.
###1372 Now, we may never know
###1376 the meaning of this beautiful pair of swans
###1379 to the people that made them,
###1381 but archaeologists have suggested that they might be hunting charms.
###1386 That when the first swans flew, the first deer would appear,
###1390 and it was the beginning of the spring hunting season.
###1393 And how they must have longed for spring.
###1398 ROBERTS: Many of the objects in this collection are mysterious.
###1402 This unique plate is made from mammoth ivory.
###1407 Some have suggested it's a map
###1410 showing the physical and spiritual worlds,
###1413 with the connection between them symbolised by a hole in the middle.
###1424 These precious bone figurines
###1427 are among the earliest depictions of people wearing fur -
###1432 further proof that plenty of these Asian pioneers
###1435 could sew clothes by this time.
###1444 (CAMERA CLICKS)
###1451 And finally, there are
###1452 these delicate and beautiful little statues of women.
###1456 And some of them are pierced, so they may have been worn as pendants,
###1459 perhaps amulets.
###1464 It's possible that they're fertility symbols,
###1466 really underlining the importance and difficulty
###1470 of producing children during such harsh conditions.
###1475 And in fact, some archaeologists
###1477 see this entire, very beautiful collection
###1480 as a cry to the spirits in a time of stress and struggle.
###1489 ROBERTS: It is amazing to think of those ancient people,
###1492 who after all originated in a much warmer place,
###1496 surviving in Ice Age Siberia.
###1504 But it seems that around this time something else happened to them.
###1509 Something which is much more difficult to explain.
###1517 This is our best guess as to what our African ancestors looked like.
###1521 This reconstruction is based on the skull of a woman
###1524 who lived over 1 00,000 years ago.
###1529 But sometime around the peak of the last Ice Age,
###1533 the faces of the people of East Asia changed.
###1538 Why?
###1550 Today, from Siberia to Hong Kong,
###1553 you come face to face with these changes.
###1558 Almond-shaped eyes, a flatter face, a smaller nose.
###1564 Most of all, we associate these features with China.
###1568 And here they have become the subject of great interest -
###1572 not to scientists, but to the beauty industry.
###1579 ROBERTS: For cosmetics companies,
###1580 understanding variation in people's faces can be big business.
###1585 Now, during the Cultural Revolution
###1587 Chinese women were forbidden from wearing make-up,
###1590 but now China is one of the biggest markets in the world.
###1599 Secret filming.
###1601 ROBERTS: Here's one multinational that's in there
###1603 trying to convince the Chinese to use their products.
###1606 Crystal, she has a very traditional Chinese eye.
###1611 So what I need to do is make her eye look bigger and more attractive.
###1615 So you're actually trying to make her look less Chinese?
###1617 No!
###1619 (BOTH LAUGHING)
###1626 ROBERTS: They claim to have some insight
###1628 into what is special about the Chinese face.
###1631 I'm curious, if a little suspicious.
###1635 Now, in here is the wrinkle laboratory
###1638 where they grade your wrinkles from nought to six.
###1643 ROBERTS: The company is trying to compare the way skin ages
###1647 in European and Chinese women.
###1650 Sit down, please.
###1653 This is all rather clinical-looking and scary, isn't it?
###1655 ROBERTS: Carole wants to assess my wrinkles
###1658 and contrast them with a Chinese woman of the same age.
###1661 -Grade one. -Grade one?
###1663 CAROLE: Yes. ROBERTS: That's good.
###1666 CAROLE: That's lateral folds.
###1669 Grade two. Crow's-feet wrinkle.
###1673 Grade one. You have very little wrinkle
###1676 -for your age. -ROBERTS: Excellent!
###1678 I've paid Carole to say that.
###1681 Thank you very much.
###1682 So how does the Chinese woman do?
###1685 CAROLE: Grade one, grade two, grade one.
###1689 -Thank you very much, Carole. -You're welcome.
###1692 ROBERTS: At our age, Carole sees very little difference.
###1696 But what happens 1 0 years later?
###1699 This is a 4 7-year-old European.
###1703 This is grade four.
###1707 Grade three.
###1709 Grade four.
###1712 ROBERTS: Compare her with a 4 7-year-old Chinese woman.
###1716 Grade two. It's grade one.
###1722 Grade one.
###1725 There's a suggestion that Chinese skin ages more slowly.
###1730 I'd need a lot more evidence to be convinced.
###1733 But that's not nearly as controversial
###1736 as the whole question of where Chinese features came from
###1740 in the first place.
###1742 It's one of the most fascinating and perplexing questions
###1746 of our human origins.
###1753 Some have suggested that these facial characteristics,
###1756 like narrower eyes, smaller noses and flatter faces,
###1760 could have been adaptations to cold,
###1763 protecting the eyes and reducing heat loss from the face.
###1772 It's an alluring idea.
###1774 The problem is, there's no evidence for it.
###1779 But there are many people in China who believe there's another explanation
###1784 for the way they look.
###1786 And their theory, if proved true, could be absolutely explosive.
###1796 ROBERTS: It would mean we'd have to totally rethink our ideas
###1799 about how Asia, and indeed the whole world, became populated.
###1806 Many Chinese people believe that they look different
###1809 because they are fundamentally different from the rest of us.
###1813 The claim is that they come from a completely separate branch
###1816 of the human family tree,
###1818 and that they descend from an ancient type of human
###1822 who arrived here in China nearly two million years ago.
###1831 ROBERTS: Before we modern humans existed,
###1834 there were earlier species of human,
###1837 such as Homo erectus.
###1839 A bit more ape-like than us, perhaps,
###1841 with a heavy brow and a smaller brain.
###1846 About 1.8 million years ago,
###1849 the Homo erectus population started spilling out of Africa.
###1854 I always believed
###1856 that Homo erectus in Asia eventually died out,
###1860 while Homo erectus in Africa ultimately evolved into us,
###1865 Homo sapiens.
###1868 Then, around 70,000 years ago, a tiny group left -
###1873 ancestors of everyone outside Africa today.
###1878 But in China they think this is completely wrong.
###1906 I've come to zhoukoudian, near Beijing,
###1909 where the Chinese say they have evidence
###1911 that Homo erectus in Asia did not die out,
###1915 but is in fact their ancestor.
###1924 They believe passionately in their separate origin,
###1927 and it's something everyone in China is taught from childhood.
###1937 It's such an amazing idea,
###1939 that the Chinese originate from a different branch
###1942 of the human family tree from the rest of us.
###1945 And it goes against everything I've discovered so far.
###1954 ROBERTS: It was here, early last century,
###1956 that the most important evidence behind this idea was discovered.
###1966 So this is the cave itself?
###1968 one of China's most revered scientists is Professor Wu xinzhi.
###1973 He's dedicated his life to studying what was found here.
###1977 -This cave named Pigeon Cave. -Pigeon Cave?
###1981 Because here usually there are many pigeons...
###1985 ROBERTS: Right. WU: ...living here.
###1986 And the main fossils were found over there.
###1992 ROBERTS: Half a million years ago, this huge pit was a cave.
###1997 And it's here that archaeologists found a treasure trove,
###2000 incredibly rare evidence of a long-lost world.
###2004 The largest collection of Homo erectus fossils ever unearthed.
###2009 The oldest skull is about half a million years old.
###2013 -Really? -Yes.
###2014 And the youngest one is between
###2019 200 and 300,000 years old.
###2023 So they were living here for...
###2025 For around 300,000 years.
###2029 -Right. -A long time.
###2031 So I believe this is the home base of Homo erectus.
###2036 ROBERTS: Right.
###2037 Professor Wu is sure that Asian Homo erectus evolved here
###2041 into the modern Chinese.
###2043 And a few metres away,
###2045 he shows me where some really crucial evidence was found.
###2050 Here, in what is called the Upper Cave, they found more skulls,
###2054 but these ones were quite different.
###2057 This is Upper Cave. Many human skeletons was found here.
###2063 30,000 years old.
###2066 ROBERTS: The skulls clearly belonged to our species,
###2069 but the researchers saw something surprising, too -
###2072 they appeared to share some features with the Homo erectus skulls.
###2076 There are many common features among them.
###2082 And I think it is most probable that
###2088 Upper Cave men are the descendants of Homo erectus.
###2096 ROBERTS: Wu believes that Asian Homo erectus
###2098 evolved into the humans found in the Upper Cave,
###2101 and that they evolved into the modern Chinese.
###2104 So, for him, Upper Cave Man is a sort of missing link,
###2109 proof the Chinese do descend from Homo erectus.
###2115 I'd love to see those ancient skulls,
###2117 but tragically, in the mayhem of the second World War,
###2121 the whole collection went missing.
###2129 Luckily, before they were lost, plaster casts were made,
###2133 and now even these copies are considered priceless.
###2138 (LAUGHING) So, this is the exhibition room.
###2141 Right.
###2142 ROBERTS: Chinese scientists come here to study the history of their people.
###2146 But the casts I want to see are securely locked away.
###2149 I will ask him to take out.
###2152 Oh, please do.
###2153 (SPEAKING MANDARIN)
###2155 I think I'm going to have to remove myself actually,
###2157 because I'm not allowed to see the drawers that the skulls come out of.
###2160 So, I'm just gonna come and stand back here discreetly.
###2164 (WU LAUGHING)
###2165 Wait for the skulls to appear.
###2170 It's sort of layers of security.
###2171 We're not allowed to see which key goes into which locker.
###2174 He keeps the key so that nobody to know the number.
###2181 -Do you know the numbers? -No.
###2182 (LAUGHS) No? Even Professor Wu doesn't know.
###2184 No, I do not want to know, because if I know that,
###2190 if it is lost, I have the responsibility.
###2194 -Yes. -But now I don't know anything.
###2197 -Right. -No responsibility for me.
###2201 ROBERTS: Finally I'm allowed in to see the plaster casts
###2204 of the Homo erectus skulls from the Lower Cave.
###2207 And Professor Wu has a surprise waiting.
###2210 (ROBERTS ExCLAIMS)
###2211 You see, this is the original specimen.
###2214 That's the original?
###2215 Yes, original.
###2217 As you know, most of the original specimens lost during the war.
###2221 I didn't know any of it had survived.
###2223 Yeah, after the war we have done some new excavation.
###2229 -ROBERTS: Right. -And got some new specimens.
###2232 -This is one of them. -Can I hold it?
###2233 Yes, yes.
###2236 I honestly thought all the specimens had been lost,
###2239 but this is an actual fossil of Homo erectus in China.
###2243 It was found in 1 966.
###2246 ROBERTS: So this is hundreds of thousands of years old, isn't it?
###2251 WU: So this is another piece.
###2257 It's just amazing for me to, I mean, to be holding in my hand
###2261 this actual fossil, which is hundreds of thousands of years old.
###2264 I honestly thought all I would see is casts, is reconstructions.
###2268 -WU: Yeah, yeah. -And this is the actual fossil.
###2270 WU: And now you hold original one.
###2272 That's amazing.
###2278 ROBERTS: But even more important
###2279 is what Professor Wu has spotted in these fossils.
###2285 First, he shows me some features of the ancient Erectus skulls
###2289 that he believes are typically Chinese.
###2293 The face is flat. The nose is flat. Not very protrude, as in Europe.
###2300 ROBERTS: Yeah, yeah.
###2301 And this part is also flat.
###2306 So, this part of the cheek bones is sort of rotated like that.
###2309 Then he shows me the much more recent Upper Cave skulls
###2312 and picks out the same distinctively Chinese features.
###2317 WU: But it also have the more flat face
###2321 and a not very protruding nose.
###2324 So the features that you're looking at in these skulls are really
###2327 the features which characterise modern Chinese people today,
###2331 and the sort of differences between your skull and my skull.
###2333 -WU: Yes, yes. -Yeah.
###2334 -Yeah, so your face here is like this. -Yeah.
###2338 -And mine like... -And yours is flatter.
###2340 -Yes. -ROBERTS: Yeah.
###2341 And your nose is flatter here than mine.
###2343 So we inherited some features from our ancestor.
###2349 ROBERTS: Professor Wu sees a clear line,
###2352 Homo erectus evolving into Upper Cave Man, becoming today's Chinese.
###2358 For him, these fossils prove that the Chinese
###2361 come from a completely different branch of the human family.
###2367 But I can see significant differences between the skulls.
###2373 The whole skull shape of Homo erectus is quite different from modern humans.
###2379 And even those features that Wu pointed out,
###2382 the nose and the cheek bones, don't seem that similar to me.
###2394 Professor Wu, I mean, you've spent a lifetime studying these skulls,
###2397 and I'm a complete novice in comparison,
###2400 but I look at this modern skull here,
###2404 this 30,000-year-old skull from zhoukoudian,
###2407 and this looks quite similar to me to other skulls from Europe
###2413 at the same time, so I don't think... It doesn't look Chinese to me.
###2417 No, but the profile in Europe is different.
###2421 Quite subtle though, isn't it?
###2430 I'm still not convinced that the Chinese are so fundamentally different
###2436 from the rest of us.
###2438 Professor Wu is so knowledgeable and his arguments are so persuasive,
###2442 so maybe I'm missing something.
###2446 ROBERTS: And there is other evidence to suggest that Professor Wu
###2449 could be right,
###2450 that the Chinese do in fact descend from a different branch of the human family
###2455 to the rest of us.
###2469 I'm travelling 2,000 kilometres into Central China,
###2473 to investigate something that's a real problem
###2476 for my out of Africa theory.
###2480 And it's all to do with stone tools.
###2487 Elsewhere in the world, our species, Homo sapiens,
###2490 is associated with sophisticated styles of tools.
###2494 Like these from Europe.
###2496 But in China, you find something completely different.
###2502 A lot of very basic tools. A type in fact typical of Homo erectus.
###2510 Archaeological evidence, then, that seems to undermine the idea
###2515 that the Chinese evolved in the same way as the rest of us.
###2520 If modern humans suddenly arrived in China,
###2522 we might expect to see modern-looking stone tools
###2526 appearing with their arrival, just like in Europe.
###2529 But the tools in this part of the world stay looking fairly crude.
###2535 And Chinese scientists say
###2536 this is because there wasn't an influx of modern humans.
###2540 But there could be another rather intriguing explanation.
###2553 ROBERTS: Archaeologist Dr Joe Kaminga
###2555 has spent decades working in Southeast Asia.
###2558 And I'm hoping that his work might shed some light
###2561 on this mystery of Chinese origins.
###2565 I mean, this really is about as crude and basic a stone tool
###2569 as you can get, isn't it?
###2570 Yes, it is.
###2571 Which is a bit bizarre, isn't it? Because in Europe
###2574 at this time they're making quite sophisticated stone tools.
###2577 So, I mean, what's going on here?
###2579 We're in a completely different part of the world here.
###2581 In Europe, there are different resources, different plants,
###2584 different animals and different kinds of stone.
###2586 And you have very large cobbles of flint in Europe,
###2589 but you don't have very large cobbles of flint here in Southeast Asia
###2592 or in South China.
###2595 ROBERTS: But there is something else here,
###2597 and Joe thinks they could've used it to make tools
###2600 just as sophisticated as European ones.
###2605 Bamboo.
###2609 Why would you go through so much trouble to make a sophisticated stone tool,
###2613 beautifully shaped, when you can just take a piece of bamboo
###2616 and use that, and throw it away when you've finished with it?
###2618 Because it's everywhere. You can always get it again, next valley along.
###2627 ROBERTS: Joe believes that the crude stone tools were just used to chop down
###2631 and work bamboo.
###2633 (CREAKING)
###2636 (ExCLAIMS)
###2639 -Excellent. -Excellent.
###2641 You carry it down the slope
###2643 and I'll follow.
###2646 (ROBERTS LAUGHING)
###2648 Watch your step there.
###2650 -Is it slippery? -It is.
###2652 (ExCLAIMS)
###2653 JOE: Perfect.
###2655 ROBERTS: It's a tantalising idea,
###2657 but it's not easy to believe that a flimsy bit of bamboo
###2660 could ever do the job of a sharp stone tool.
###2664 We need to put it to the test.
###2666 If you just want to make a small knife, we've got a flake.
###2669 -Right. -Just saw it.
###2671 You can open up the cut by bending the bamboo.
###2677 The next step is simply to thin the edge.
###2681 And just cut... cut it on the inside of the bamboo.
###2684 And it should work very well.
###2686 It has a completely different texture to wood.
###2688 The fibres are very long, very even. Everything's very predictable.
###2693 -There's no knots in it. -ROBERTS: No.
###2695 And it's as simple as that. 'Cause I think I'm about done.
###2699 ROBERTS: Really? JOE: Yeah.
###2700 And behold.
###2703 It's pretty sharp stuff.
###2705 ROBERTS: Bamboo's sharpness comes from silica,
###2708 a hard mineral also found in sand.
###2712 I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to...
###2715 butcher a chicken with it, though.
###2717 (CHICKEN CLUCKING)
###2720 ROBERTS: What are you making now?
###2722 I'm making an arrow head.
###2725 JOE: So I'll just start to shape the point.
###2729 ROBERTS: We don't know if ancient people used bamboo arrow heads,
###2733 but it seemed like a good way to test the limits of bamboo technology.
###2740 A very snug fit.
###2741 ROBERTS: Now we need to shoot something.
###2744 (BOTH LAUGHING)
###2748 ROBERTS: First, I want to see what Joe's bamboo knife is capable of.
###2752 So this is going to be somebody's dinner, hopefully.
###2754 Well, maybe ours.
###2757 -All right. -Okay, I'll have a leg.
###2763 (CRACKING)
###2767 You have to saw a bit, but it's getting through it.
###2772 Oh, this is pretty good, Joe. Look at this.
###2775 JOE: Good.
###2778 Well, we've just disjointed a leg, so that's...
###2780 The bamboo has got through skin, it's got through ligament as well.
###2784 So it's doing pretty well, I'd say.
###2786 How about that?
###2787 ROBERTS: And,just how effective is a bamboo arrow?
###2790 Well, I don't think I'm going to be too adventurous.
###2792 Shall I try the arrow head you just made?
###2795 Go for it. You don't mind if I step 20 metres aside?
###2798 Yeah, you keep well to one side, Joe.
###2800 I wouldn't trust me with this at all.
###2804 Let's have a look at this, then.
###2807 (LAUGHS)
###2809 Can you see that, stuck in the ground?
###2815 Well, how about we try the cabbage?
###2817 ROBERTS: I mean, look at that, though. That's a bamboo arrow
###2820 embedded in a bit of wood.
###2825 Excellent.
###2826 (JOE CLAPPING)
###2827 Arrow in a cabbage. Look.
###2831 Well, that's pretty impressive for bamboo technology, I think.
###2835 Well, now that you've killed the cabbage,
###2837 we can have that for dinner as well, with the chicken.
###2839 Excellent.
###2842 ROBERTS: Bamboo turns out to be surprisingly versatile,
###2846 so it's at least possible that modern humans from Africa were here
###2850 using sophisticated tools, made not of stone but of bamboo.
###2857 But that still doesn't prove that the Chinese came out of Africa
###2860 with everybody else.
###2865 However, there is something that could settle this debate
###2868 of where the Chinese come from once and for all.
###2873 After that...
###2874 ROBERTS: I'm meeting Professor Jin Li, one of China's leading geneticists.
###2879 Recently he led a project that set out to prove that the Chinese evolved
###2883 independently from everyone else,
###2885 from Homo erectus, here in China.
###2891 Before the project started, I was hoping that I could identify
###2895 or could be able to find the evidence
###2897 that support independent origin of Chinese in China.
###2901 Because I'm a Chinese, I came from China,
###2905 and through the education process
###2907 I always believed that there is something special about Chinese.
###2914 ROBERTS: He's singled out a male genetic marker,
###2917 which only appeared about 80,000 years ago in Africa.
###2921 So any man who carries that marker must have recent African ancestors
###2926 and can't be descended from the more ancient Asian Homo erectus.
###2932 Jin took DNA from over 1 60 ethnic groups around East Asia.
###2938 over 1 2,000 samples.
###2947 And so, what did you find?
###2949 We did not see any... even one single individual
###2954 that could be considered as the descendant
###2958 of the Homo erectus in China.
###2961 Rather, everybody was a descendant of our ancestors from Africa.
###2967 ROBERTS: The result couldn't have been any clearer.
###2970 ROBERTS: How does that make you feel, as a Chinese person?
###2974 After I saw the evidences that we generate in my laboratory,
###2980 I think we should all be happy with that, because after all,
###2984 modern humans from different part of the world
###2987 are not so different from each other and we are very close relatives.
###2991 ROBERTS: That's great. Thank you.
###2995 ROBERTS: So Africa is the home of the Chinese.
###2999 Jin Li's research confirms that their ancestors, too,
###3003 were part of that tiny group that left the continent
###3007 around 70,000 years ago.
###3010 And genetics is also helping us understand
###3013 how people spread through Asia.
###3016 our ancestors reached Siberia very early on.
###3019 But there was another even earlier migration route,
###3023 spreading along the coast of southern Asia
###3025 and eventually reaching China.
###3033 one day, as we push forward the frontiers of genetic research,
###3038 we may even discover the origin of those Chinese features.
###3042 So, if they weren't a result of adaptation to cold,
###3046 where might they have come from?
###3048 It could simply be chance, or it could be down to sex.
###3053 If particular features are considered attractive in a population,
###3057 then people with those features
###3058 are much more likely to pass their genes on to the next generation.
###3062 And if that group then goes on to flourish,
###3065 those features could become very widespread.
###3072 ROBERTS: And the handful of people with these features
###3074 certainly did flourish.
###3077 Their descendants filled the vast spaces of Asia.
###3083 And eventually they would move on from hunting and gathering
###3086 to build one of the greatest civilizations of the world.
###3096 In this city, the hub of the world's second-largest economy,
###3101 it feels like I'm on a different planet
###3103 to the one inhabited by those hunter-gatherers.
###3105 But is it possible to look back into prehistory
###3109 and find those early steps, the seeds of civilisation in China?
###3124 ROBERTS: What was it that turned hunter-gatherers into empire builders?
###3132 I'm travelling through the awe-inspiring landscape of Guilin, in South China,
###3138 in search of the key to their success.
###3159 This is the Tsung Pien cave.
###3162 Excavations here tell us it was once lived in by hunter-gatherers.
###3168 And in 2001, a wonderful discovery was made.
###3181 These fragments are so precious that I'm not even allowed to touch them.
###3186 They are what remains of one of the oldest pots in China.
###3190 In fact, one of the oldest pots in the world.
###3205 So, who made this pot?
###3206 Well, the people living in this cave so many thousands of years ago
###3211 would have been nomadic hunter-gatherers,
###3213 still living an ancient lifestyle in many ways.
###3217 But those insignificant-looking crude pieces of pot
###3221 mark a great technological leap forward.
###3226 ROBERTS: So prehistoric pottery's has also been found in this cave?
###3229 ROBERTS: Pots are something we take for granted.
###3232 But for those ancient hunter-gatherers,
###3234 pottery was a part of a completely new way of life.
###3241 So how did they do it?
###3247 I'm meeting a team of experimental archaeologists,
###3250 who think they might have the answer.
###3253 The first breakthrough must have been
###3255 finding out how to stop the pots cracking when they were fired,
###3258 tempering them by mixing calcite rock with the clay.
###3263 And they even have an idea how the pots might have been shaped,
###3266 thousands of years before the invention of the potter's wheel.
###3271 This is very clever. They've dug a pit here
###3273 to basically give us the form of the pot, almost like a mould.
###3276 And then we're pressing this clay in little slabs down into the...
###3280 (SPEAKING IN MANDARIN)
###3281 ROBERTS: ...pre-formed pit.
###3282 (SPEAKING IN MANDARIN)
###3284 ROBERTS: Transforming clay into hard pottery
###3286 requires firing at a high temperature.
###3289 Today, this is done at 1,000 degrees Celsius in a kiln -
###3293 way beyond the capabilities of those hunter-gatherers.
###3302 They would've had open fires,
###3304 which only produce temperatures of about 250 degrees.
###3308 I'm quite doubtful this is going to be enough.
###3316 So how's our pot?
###3318 (ExCLAIMS) I think that's it.
###3321 I think that's our pot there, and it looks okay!
###3324 (SPEAKING IN MANDARIN)
###3331 ROBERTS: Fantastic.
###3336 There are many different theories about
###3337 why the Chinese hunter-gatherers might have started making pots.
###3340 Some people say it was a symbol of prestige.
###3343 But the Chinese archaeologists think
###3345 that the explanation is much more simple - cooking.
###3351 ROBERTS: Pots meant that a wider range of food could be cooked and stored,
###3356 vital in hard times.
###3359 And by 9,000 years ago, there was another innovation -
###3363 farming.
###3365 One of the things that those early Chinese potters would have been eating
###3369 was wild rice.
###3371 Now, it certainly wouldn't have been the main source of food,
###3373 because it was hard to collect
###3375 and actually didn't give much energy in return.
###3378 But despite the availability of other vegetables,
###3381 it was rice that became more and more important
###3384 and even crucial to the early success of the Chinese.
###3389 ROBERTS: This looks good, doesn't it?
###3390 ROBERTS: But wild rice doesn't produce much grain.
###3393 So how was such an unpromising plant changed into the food
###3397 that would feed a continent?
###3405 Well, one of those early farmers must have stumbled
###3409 on a way of tricking nature.
###3417 Rice needs plenty of water,
###3419 so I'm helping the farmers irrigate their paddy field,
###3421 creating the type of watery, marshy environment
###3425 that rice naturally grows in.
###3427 But when rice is deprived of water, it does something rather interesting.
###3431 It starts to produce masses of seeds.
###3433 So what the early farmers hit on
###3435 was a cunning plan to get rice to do just that,
###3438 by creating an artificial drought.
###3447 ROBERTS: Someone came up with the idea of filling paddy fields up with water
###3451 and then allowing it to evaporate.
###3454 It's as though the rice plants expect a drought and panic,
###3458 producing many more seeds.
###3460 Grains of rice.
###3464 Probably one of the things which made rice so appealing
###3466 to hunter-gatherers and made them want to grow it
###3468 was that you could store the seeds for food during the winter.
###3473 ROBERTS: once there was more food and it could be relied on,
###3476 populations boomed.
###3478 Families settled down.
###3479 They started to build villages, towns, and eventually cities.
###3486 These humble plants represent the end of the journey
###3490 for Chinese hunter-gatherers,
###3492 and the beginnings of something new,
###3494 farming and civilisation.
###3497 It's no exaggeration to say that this development
###3500 was the foundation of the most successful
###3503 group of humans living today.
###3506 And the rest is history.
