It's called scissor dancing.

way, way off the beaten track

in Andamarca, which is a


25
0:1:8,35 --> 0:1:9,63

So Krishna, are we going
to see scissor dancer?

KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Yeah,
scissor dancing.

0:1:18,59 --> 0:1:19,12
ANTHONY VERLAINE:
What is that?


35
0:1:19,12 --> 0:1:21,24
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: It's a
centuries old tradition where


36
0:1:21,24 --> 0:1:23,66
two dancers and two
musicians play.


37
0:1:23,66 --> 0:1:26,5
The dancers wear elaborate
costumes and they hold


38
0:1:26,5 --> 0:1:27,4
scissors in one hand.


39
0:1:27,4 --> 0:1:33,39
They do really death defying
sort of acts of great daring.


40
0:1:33,39 --> 0:1:34,69
Just sort of crazy shit.


41
0:1:34,69 --> 0:1:37,82
The origins of scissor dancing
are kind of mysterious too.


42
0:1:37,82 --> 0:1:41,83
Like in the 16th century when
the conquistadors came around


43
0:1:41,83 --> 0:1:44,93
and saw them doing these feats
of strength, endurance.


44
0:1:44,93 --> 0:1:46,5
And they thought to themselves,
man, these guys


45
0:1:46,5 --> 0:1:49,23
must have made a pact with
the devil in order


46
0:1:49,23 --> 0:1:50,22
to keep this up.


47
0:1:50,22 --> 0:1:51,35
ANTHONY VERLAINE: Pact
with the devil, cool.


48
0:1:51,35 --> 0:1:52,35
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Yeah.


49
0:1:52,35 --> 0:1:54,37
I'm actually starting
to feel a little


50
0:1:54,37 --> 0:1:56,7
nauseous on these roads.


51
0:1:56,7 --> 0:1:57,39
We've been going up
and down and we're


52

like, dusty and windy--


53
0:2:0,556 --> 0:2:2,516
ANTHONY VERLAINE: And the
altitude, like 5,000 meters


54
0:2:2,516 --> 0:2:4,322

0:2:4,322 --> 0:2:5,61
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: (COUGHING)
Maybe that's why


56
0:2:5,61 --> 0:2:6,86
I'm coughing so much.


57
0:2:6,86 --> 0:2:11,66



58
0:2:11,66 --> 0:2:14,89
We've made it to Andamarca, a
tiny remote village high in


59
0:2:14,89 --> 0:2:16,14
the Peruvian Andes.


60
0:2:16,14 --> 0:2:20,62



61
0:2:20,62 --> 0:2:23,49
We're at an elevation of
something like 12,000 feet.


62
0:2:23,49 --> 0:2:24,775
The journey was arduous.


63
0:2:24,775 --> 0:2:26,64
And honestly, we
feel like shit.


64
0:2:26,64 --> 0:2:29,45
I'm going to go meet our troop
of scissor dancers alone


65
0:2:29,45 --> 0:2:32,48
because Anthony was feeling so
badly that he has to lie down


66
0:2:32,48 --> 0:2:34,4
and take some more oxygen.

KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: During our
walk, the group explained that


87
0:3:37,47 --> 0:3:39,97
cactus needles and another
sharp objects are used to


88
0:3:39,97 --> 0:3:42,71
prove the dancer's resistance
to pain.

extreme feats would be

0:3:45,2 --> 0:3:47,56
deemed victorious by the town.

0:3:47,56 --> 0:3:49,58

scissor dancing?

today Anthony was in bed

seemed to be altitude sickness

be something a

some local medicine on me.

to pass away before the

everyone for making us feel so
