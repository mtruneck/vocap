###15 SUROOSH ALVI: Yesterday, we came here with the police for
###17 the operation that felt like we were on the set of Cops.
###20 We're back here today, much to the chagrin of the cops, who
###24 say that it's too dangerous to be here because this is a
###27 Taliban town, and this is where everyone gets kidnapped
###29 from, and that we shouldn't be here.
###30 But we wanted to find out from the people who live here
###32 exactly what they thought of the operation yesterday.
###37 So let's go see.
###39 Our fixer was very nervous about being a sitting duck in
###41 the middle of Orangi Town, to the point where he refused to
###44 get out of the car.
###45 He said we were asking for trouble.
###47 We promised we'd only ask two quick questions and then get
###49 the hell out of there.

###102 SUROOSH ALVI: Let's go.
###103 Let's bounce, people are watching and making
###105 calls, so let's go.
###107 As soon as we approached those guys, the vibe suddenly
###109 changed, and I had a sinking feeling that we had overstayed
###112 our welcome.
###113 Let's get the fuck out of here.
###114 Get in, quickly.
###116 
###120 The last guys, I think, were Taliban.
###122 
###142 The last two people I went up to, they
###144 refused to talk to us.
###145 I looked over at my corner, and there was a guy glaring at
###147 me on the phone, making a call to someone else, which was our
###151 cue to leave.
###152 
###157 We didn't get kidnapped in Orangi Town, so we decided to
###160 push our luck by visiting the place where the kidnapped
###162 victims are reportedly held--
###164 the dump.
###166 The air was thick with smoldering rot.
###168 There were millions of flies, and the stench was unbearable.
###171 MALE SPEAKER: God dammit, man.
###172 I think they're up my pants
###175 SUROOSH ALVI: Look at this cute little guy.
###177 Hey, little buddy.
###178 How's life living off garbage?
###180 Oh.
###181 
###183 Ugh.
###185 
###188 Fuck.
###189 
###191 We're here--
###194 fuck.
###195 We're here-- hold on.
###198 MALE SPEAKER: Standing still is a problem with the flies,
###200 definitely.
###201 SUROOSH ALVI: Yeah.
###201 We're here, an hour outside of Karachi, in the largest waste
###206 dump in Karachi, and some say the largest
###210 waste dump in the world.
###211 It's just like maybe out of a film about the future and
###215 post-apocalypse and this is all that's left.
###220 And when the gangsters kidnap people, the best place to
###224 bring them is just on the other side of this garbage
###227 dump, because no one ever comes out there.
###228 I mean, why would they?
###229 It's brutal.
###230 It's like hell on Earth.
###231 
###234 I knew that going to one of the largest garbage dumps in
###236 the world--
###237 70 million square feet and counting--
###239 would be a miserable experience, but I was shocked
###243 at just how miserable it was.
###246 When Pakistan became a nation in 1947, Karachi was home to
###249 about 450,000 people.
###253 Today, there are almost 18 million people producing about
###256 8,000 metric tons of trash every day.
###261 Scavengers here burn that crash, sending god knows what
###264 into the air over Karachi, in order to extract the tiniest
###268 bits of metal that they can sell to recyclers for pennies.
###272 The UNHCR reports that as many as 20,000 children spend their
###276 days here in the dump, most of them refugees from the war in
###279 Afghanistan.
###280 
###285 Another effect of the war in Afghanistan has been a major
###288 increase in the flow of heroin into Pakistan, and at rock
###291 bottom prices.
###292 Come on, let's go.
###293 
###295 MALE SPEAKER: All right, we're coming, man.
###296 SUROOSH ALVI: We're going to buy some heroin.
###298 We're going to buy some dope with these guys.
###302 And it's weird, because we're like, hey, can we watch you
###304 guys shoot up and buy some heroin?
###306 They're like, sure, why not?
###309 Sounds like a perfectly good idea.
###312 While one gram of heroin can cost more than $200 in the US,
###315 here in Karachi, it costs about $0.80.
###319 Wow, we just lost them dropping down.
###322 This is the shop for heroin.
###324 Even at these ridiculously low prices, the market for illegal
###328 opiates in Pakistan is more than $1 billion annually, with
###331 roughly 160 metric tons of heroin coming in every year,
###335 feeding the habits of over four million addicts.
###338 We headed back to these guys' favorite place to shoot up--
###341 the middle of a busy street.
###342 Now we've got some heroin zombies on our tail.

###440 SUROOSH ALVI: Since we were having such a heavy day, our
###441 fixer decided to take us someplace that he thought
###443 might cheer us up.
###445 So we're going to see some crocodiles that they say are
###450 hundreds, if not thousands, of years old.
###452 
###456 Are those things fake or real?
###459 OK, I don't know what the fuck is going on, dude?
###461 I don't know why I'm here.
###463 Oh, what's in its mouth?
###466 No, thanks.
###466 I am not going in there.
###467 You can go ahead.
###469 Aw.
###470 
###474 BASIM USMANI: These crocodiles are actually disciples of a
###477 famous Punjabi saint named Ganjshakar.
###479 They're famous for eating gulab jamuns and halva.
###482 They're the only crocodiles in the world that eat desserts.
###485 SUROOSH ALVI: That's random.
###486 
###489 That's a great sound effect.
###491 Why is there a crocodile farm museum here?
###498 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###499 
###504 SUROOSH ALVI: After that weird interlude, we headed back to
###506 the hotel to rest up for one of the scariest appointments
###508 we'd ever made--
###509 a meeting with a target killer.
