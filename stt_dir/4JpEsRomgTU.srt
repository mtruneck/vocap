[CHAINSAWS RUNNING]


3
0:0:15,744 --> 0:0:19,48
TIM HENAGIN: Once you do it, you
feel that adrenaline rush,


4
0:0:19,48 --> 0:0:23,18
and you're on it until
the end, and you


5
0:0:23,18 --> 0:0:24,37
see it put to bed.


6
0:0:24,37 --> 0:0:26,17
And do some of the mop up--


7
0:0:26,17 --> 0:0:28,56
the clean-up and rehab.


8
0:0:28,56 --> 0:0:33,6
Once you get a season of that,
it's in your blood, and


9
0:0:33,6 --> 0:0:34,85
there's nothing else.


10
0:0:34,85 --> 0:0:48,61



11
0:0:48,61 --> 0:0:50,3
THOMAS NARRATING: While the
rest of the country is


12
0:0:50,3 --> 0:0:53,14
flipping its lid over cyber
crime, illegal aliens, and


13
0:0:53,14 --> 0:0:56,32
mutagenic fuel gases, the
Pacific Northwest still spends


14
0:0:56,32 --> 0:0:57,93
its summer struggling
with mankind's


15
0:0:57,93 --> 0:0:59,61
first and oldest enemy--


16
0:0:59,61 --> 0:1:0,95
fire.


17
0:1:0,95 --> 0:1:4,16
In the last decade hundreds of
thousands of forest fires have


18
0:1:4,16 --> 0:1:8,75
scorched 5.5 million acres
of American land.


19
0:1:8,75 --> 0:1:12,59
The average Oregon summer sees
561 wildfires damage 16,000


20
0:1:12,59 --> 0:1:15,82
acres of often pristine forest,
causing mind-boggling


21
0:1:15,82 --> 0:1:18,73
damage and devastation.


22
0:1:18,73 --> 0:1:20,57
Last month we traveled to
Medford, Oregon to team up


23
0:1:20,57 --> 0:1:24,15
with a firefighting crew
from Grayback Forestry.


24
0:1:24,15 --> 0:1:26,86
Their job is to amble right up
to a roaring blaze and dig a


25
0:1:26,86 --> 0:1:30,17
line around it to choke
the fire to death.


26
0:1:30,17 --> 0:1:32,9
When there isn't a fire going,
they cut back and relax by


27
0:1:32,9 --> 0:1:35,48
walking up the side of a
45-degree cliff and clearing


28
0:1:35,48 --> 0:1:39,7
out old underbrush which
provides fuel for these fires.


29
0:1:39,7 --> 0:1:40,35
They're easily the
hardest-working


30
0:1:40,35 --> 0:1:41,6
people in tree business.


31
0:1:41,6 --> 0:1:52,622



32
0:1:52,622 --> 0:1:54,12
THOMAS: Hey, it's Thomas.


33
0:1:54,12 --> 0:1:57,23
It's 5:00 in the morning,
or something.


34
0:1:57,23 --> 0:1:59,94
We're in Oregon in
a parking lot.


35
0:1:59,94 --> 0:2:6,23
We're about to go into the
forest and tear down trees so


36
0:2:6,23 --> 0:2:7,62
other trees don't catch fire.


37
0:2:7,62 --> 0:2:12,966



38
0:2:12,966 --> 0:2:15,37
SHANE STANCLIFF: Today, the unit
we're on now is in Rogue


39
0:2:15,37 --> 0:2:17,86
River, which is a
45-minute drive.


40
0:2:17,86 --> 0:2:20,48
It changes every
different unit.


41
0:2:20,48 --> 0:2:23,69
Usually every week, or every
other week, you've got to grab


42
0:2:23,69 --> 0:2:24,94
oil for chainsaws.


43
0:2:24,94 --> 0:2:49,515



44
0:2:49,515 --> 0:2:55,12
THOMAS: We've got to pile into
this giant box on the back of


45
0:2:55,12 --> 0:2:57,85
a pickup that they
call a crummy.


46
0:2:57,85 --> 0:2:59,88
I'm guessing for good reason.


47
0:2:59,88 --> 0:3:0,28
It feels dumb.


48
0:3:0,28 --> 0:3:3,22
I mean, these guys get up every
morning this hour, but I


49
0:3:3,22 --> 0:3:5,3
feel physically shaken.


50
0:3:5,3 --> 0:3:8,76
I'm just not used
to 5 o'clock.


51
0:3:8,76 --> 0:3:10,49
It's probably a healthier
way of doing thing.


52
0:3:10,49 --> 0:3:10,875
All right.


53
0:3:10,875 --> 0:3:12,73
I guess we've got to get
in the truck right now.


54
0:3:12,73 --> 0:3:15,21
CRAIG FRANCISCO: We usually
meet at the shop somewhere


55
0:3:15,21 --> 0:3:16,91
around 5:30 AM, 5:45 AM.


56
0:3:16,91 --> 0:3:20,57
We'll load up the trucks that
we're taking up to the unit.


57
0:3:20,57 --> 0:3:21,22
Get everything ready.


58
0:3:21,22 --> 0:3:22,39
Make sure the tools
are in there.


59
0:3:22,39 --> 0:3:26,63
Make sure we've got enough
fuel and bottle oil.


60
0:3:26,63 --> 0:3:27,33
Then we'll all head out.


61
0:3:27,33 --> 0:3:29,56
About 6 o'clock we
leave the shop.


62
0:3:29,56 --> 0:3:33,81
And depending on how far,
usually half hour to an hour,


63
0:3:33,81 --> 0:3:35,59
it takes us to get
to the unit.


64
0:3:35,59 --> 0:3:37,97
You really get to know the
guys you work with.


65
0:3:37,97 --> 0:3:41,1
Everyone's about the same age
and has the same interests.


66
0:3:41,1 --> 0:3:43,6
We're working outside, so
everyone loves the hiking.


67
0:3:43,6 --> 0:3:46,57
If they're not into mountain
biking, they're into ATV


68
0:3:46,57 --> 0:3:47,44
riding, or dirt biking.


69
0:3:47,44 --> 0:3:49,3
Everyone fishes,
likes camping.


70
0:3:49,3 --> 0:3:51,8
So it's easy to get along
with everyone.


71
0:3:51,8 --> 0:3:55,48
Everyone's down to earth and
has the same interests.


72
0:3:55,48 --> 0:3:59,95
Our oxygen tank is usually
a handkerchief over us.


73
0:3:59,95 --> 0:4:2,59
And if you're smart about it,
and the smoke's going at you,


74
0:4:2,59 --> 0:4:4,911
you just kind of step aside for
a minute and let it pass


75
0:4:4,911 --> 0:4:5,82
as the wind shifts.


76
0:4:5,82 --> 0:4:7,39
If you can.


77
0:4:7,39 --> 0:4:9,92
It's kind of rough.


78
0:4:9,92 --> 0:4:11,97
Last year, it was
my first season.


79
0:4:11,97 --> 0:4:14,1
I didn't really have
a long period away.


80
0:4:14,1 --> 0:4:16,2
But you're gone.


81
0:4:16,2 --> 0:4:17,75
You miss your family.


82
0:4:17,75 --> 0:4:20,68
Your wife misses you
and wants you home.


83
0:4:20,68 --> 0:4:25,53
We did a fire here in town, and
Roxy Ann was the mountain.


84
0:4:25,53 --> 0:4:27,73
Probably a two-day night
shift is what I did,


85
0:4:27,73 --> 0:4:28,81
and that was out.


86
0:4:28,81 --> 0:4:31,2
Before we come into something
like this


87
0:4:31,2 --> 0:4:32,37
we'll have a briefing.


88
0:4:32,37 --> 0:4:37,57
And whoever is the incident
commander of the fire at the


89
0:4:37,57 --> 0:4:40,42
time will kind of tell
us what to expect,


90
0:4:40,42 --> 0:4:41,43
what to look out for.


91
0:4:41,43 --> 0:4:43,39
We don't just show up
and start running


92
0:4:43,39 --> 0:4:44,3
at it with our tools.


93
0:4:44,3 --> 0:4:45,8
There's the fire.


94
0:4:45,8 --> 0:4:45,86
Let's put it out.


95
0:4:45,86 --> 0:4:47,18
We usually have a pretty
good plan.


96
0:4:47,18 --> 0:4:51,78



97
0:4:51,78 --> 0:4:54,13
Usually we'll do the bucket
drop with the helicopters,


98
0:4:54,13 --> 0:4:57,6
dropping water on them, dropping
retardant on them to


99
0:4:57,6 --> 0:5:0,9
slow it down to where it
gets safe to work with.


100
0:5:0,9 --> 0:5:5,795
It's a real slimy, slick,
kind of wet material


101
0:5:5,795 --> 0:5:6,55
that they'll drop.


102
0:5:6,55 --> 0:5:9,83
And it gets everything red, so
once the flame does get to it,


103
0:5:9,83 --> 0:5:11,875
it slows it down enough to
let us work a little bit


104
0:5:11,875 --> 0:5:13,5
more in this area.


105
0:5:13,5 --> 0:5:15,908
And once you get the line dug
around it, you'll get the hose


106
0:5:15,908 --> 0:5:17,52
down there and you'll
start the perimeter.


107
0:5:17,52 --> 0:5:21,8
Like we're here on the line, and
the fire was right here.


108
0:5:21,8 --> 0:5:23,34
If they had the water
it slows it down.


109
0:5:23,34 --> 0:5:24,265
We'll just start in 10 feet.


110
0:5:24,265 --> 0:5:27,31
And we'll scrape everything
hot back in.


111
0:5:27,31 --> 0:5:28,61
We'll spread the pieces out and


112
0:5:28,61 --> 0:5:30,5
extinguish the flames ourselves.


113
0:5:30,5 --> 0:5:33,836
That's basically our job is to
get what we can with the tools


114
0:5:33,836 --> 0:5:37,21
and make the fire go out.


115
0:5:37,21 --> 0:5:38,97
Things will grow back.


116
0:5:38,97 --> 0:5:41,55
And if you guys were here a few
months earlier, this would


117
0:5:41,55 --> 0:5:45,11
have been green already.


118
0:5:45,11 --> 0:5:49,27
Over time there will
be some new trees.


119
0:5:49,27 --> 0:5:52,44
MALE SPEAKER: So if you're
allergic or not, OK, there's


120
0:5:52,44 --> 0:5:56,545
an epi kit on the dash of my
truck with the hazmat So if


121
0:5:56,545 --> 0:6:3,195
you get stung, let me know and
I'll let you jack yourself up.


122
0:6:3,195 --> 0:6:5,92
THOMAS: So we basically just
walked to the job site, and


123
0:6:5,92 --> 0:6:8,11
we're all already beat.


124
0:6:8,11 --> 0:6:11,7
This is a lot more vertical than
I'm used to things being


125
0:6:11,7 --> 0:6:12,8
this early.


126
0:6:12,8 --> 0:6:14,27
Our camera guy puked.


127
0:6:14,27 --> 0:6:17,82
I'm actually kind of jealous of
him because I've still got


128
0:6:17,82 --> 0:6:19,72
the full night's pizza sitting
on my stomach.


129
0:6:19,72 --> 0:6:22,3



130
0:6:22,3 --> 0:6:24,875
The tree dust is playing
hell with my sinuses.


131
0:6:24,875 --> 0:6:28,19
JESSE KIENE: See, just imagine
the fire moving uphill.


132
0:6:28,19 --> 0:6:32,22
It gets into this brush, and
then you have your smaller


133
0:6:32,22 --> 0:6:36,21
mid-canopy, and then it just
carries into the large trees.


134
0:6:36,21 --> 0:6:38,898
So what the cutters are doing is
they're coming up below us


135
0:6:38,898 --> 0:6:42,48
here, working up the hill, and
they're taking pretty much the


136
0:6:42,48 --> 0:6:46,65
smaller trees, keeping it to a
spacing so they're not just


137
0:6:46,65 --> 0:6:47,88
clearing the forest.


138
0:6:47,88 --> 0:6:52,62
And we're trying to manually
recreate what a fire would do.


139
0:6:52,62 --> 0:6:56,22
THOMAS: This is the first time
I've seen Shane sit, and it's


140
0:6:56,22 --> 0:6:59,87
been like an hour and a half
of just straight walking


141
0:6:59,87 --> 0:7:5,6
uphill with saw, destroying
trees right and left.


142
0:7:5,6 --> 0:7:6,28
SHANE STANCLIFF: This is easy.


143
0:7:6,28 --> 0:7:10,31
I mean, we get higher up and
it's like a lot of rocks.


144
0:7:10,31 --> 0:7:13,18
The whole ground, you'll just
take one step up and three


145
0:7:13,18 --> 0:7:14,48
steps down.


146
0:7:14,48 --> 0:7:16,702
So it's tough.


147
0:7:16,702 --> 0:7:21,85
THOMAS: I am carrying my body
weight in forestry supplies


148
0:7:21,85 --> 0:7:28,835
going down a 50-degree incline
to chop down some shrubs so


149
0:7:28,835 --> 0:7:32,815
the forest doesn't
destroy this.


150
0:7:32,815 --> 0:7:35,42
SHANE STANCLIFF: That happens
a lot, even with us, dude.


151
0:7:35,42 --> 0:7:39,196



152
0:7:39,196 --> 0:7:44,296
THOMAS: Slowly getting less
enamored of this job.


153
0:7:44,296 --> 0:7:45,96
SHANE STANCLIFF: Thank you.


154
0:7:45,96 --> 0:7:48,606
Thanks for carrying
it out here.


155
0:7:48,606 --> 0:7:49,89
THOMAS: I really feel
kind of worthless


156
0:7:49,89 --> 0:7:51,44
compared to these guys.


157
0:7:51,44 --> 0:7:56,1
I know if I had a chainsaw in
hand, I'd just be getting it


158
0:7:56,1 --> 0:7:58,91
caught in trees right and left,
having the blade just


159
0:7:58,91 --> 0:8:1,642
sucked down into everything
I touch.


160
0:8:1,642 --> 0:8:3,88
I'm going to leave this
for the real guys.


161
0:8:3,88 --> 0:8:7,464



162
0:8:7,464 --> 0:8:12,3
JAKE ADAMS: I've been doing this
for roughly three years.


163
0:8:12,3 --> 0:8:15,17
I started back in '07.


164
0:8:15,17 --> 0:8:16,37
Just moved up here.


165
0:8:16,37 --> 0:8:20,34
I'd been teaching for a little
while outside of Reno, and one


166
0:8:20,34 --> 0:8:23,56
day I realized that I wasn't
there for the kids.


167
0:8:23,56 --> 0:8:25,29
I was there for a paycheck.


168
0:8:25,29 --> 0:8:27,78
And I always told myself that if
I found myself teaching in


169
0:8:27,78 --> 0:8:30,54
that kind of situation that I
have no business being there.


170
0:8:30,54 --> 0:8:32,28
I'd always wanted to get
involved with fire fighting,


171
0:8:32,28 --> 0:8:34,95
so came on out, thought
I'd give it a shot.


172
0:8:34,95 --> 0:8:36,84
I do enjoy fighting fire.


173
0:8:36,84 --> 0:8:40,47
And I love doing that
part of the job.


174
0:8:40,47 --> 0:8:43,84
However, if we can mitigate them
before it comes down to


175
0:8:43,84 --> 0:8:46,56
getting to a big point,
I think we're


176
0:8:46,56 --> 0:8:47,61
better off that way.


177
0:8:47,61 --> 0:8:51,94
You're with the same guys, the
same 20 people for 14 days,


178
0:8:51,94 --> 0:8:58,82
possibly 21 days at the time,
and if you have thin skin, and


179
0:8:58,82 --> 0:9:3,45
you can't take a joke, then
you're going to have trouble.


180
0:9:3,45 --> 0:9:4,34
So everyone really tries.


181
0:9:4,34 --> 0:9:7,33
And I think especially nowadays,
we've been able to


182
0:9:7,33 --> 0:9:9,98
really stay nice and
light-hearted while staying


183
0:9:9,98 --> 0:9:12,16
safe out in the woods,
and it's been great.


184
0:9:12,16 --> 0:9:14,5
And I'm loving it right now.


185
0:9:14,5 --> 0:9:16,72
It's cheaper than a
gym membership.


186
0:9:16,72 --> 0:9:21,51



187
0:9:21,51 --> 0:9:21,8
THOMAS: Feels brisk.


188
0:9:21,8 --> 0:9:23,671
MALE SPEAKER: Underwear that
looks like hairy butt cheeks.


189
0:9:23,671 --> 0:9:28,64
[LAUGHTER]


190
0:9:28,64 --> 0:9:30,51
THOMAS: At least I chose today
to wear probably the gayest


191
0:9:30,51 --> 0:9:31,76
underwear I own.


192
0:9:31,76 --> 0:9:34,472



193
0:9:34,472 --> 0:9:37,476
MALE SPEAKER: Here's
your belt strap.


194
0:9:37,476 --> 0:9:39,0
Now, you want it to ride low.


195
0:9:39,0 --> 0:9:39,864
THOMAS: Yeah?


196
0:9:39,864 --> 0:9:40,73
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


197
0:9:40,73 --> 0:9:42,266
THOMAS: OK.


198
0:9:42,266 --> 0:9:45,65
I'm currently dressed like a
Frosted Mini-Wheats version of


199
0:9:45,65 --> 0:9:47,79
a forest fire fighter.


200
0:9:47,79 --> 0:9:51,0
And we're going to
go dig some line.


201
0:9:51,0 --> 0:9:53,59
There's not a fire right now,
but it is good practice.


202
0:9:53,59 --> 0:9:57,0
Line is basically a ditch that
you surround the fire with,


203
0:9:57,0 --> 0:9:59,922
and then it can't
get over that.


204
0:9:59,922 --> 0:10:0,99
TIM HENAGIN: You're not
trying to do the


205
0:10:0,99 --> 0:10:4,32
whole line by yourself.


206
0:10:4,32 --> 0:10:6,663
You're going to come
along and do this,


207
0:10:6,663 --> 0:10:8,46
and then just a swipe.


208
0:10:8,46 --> 0:10:9,73
It's pretty much like this.


209
0:10:9,73 --> 0:10:11,24
Move a little bit, like that.


210
0:10:11,24 --> 0:10:14,8
Move a little bit, like that.


211
0:10:14,8 --> 0:10:16,105
MALE SPEAKER: Cutters
are the first one


212
0:10:16,105 --> 0:10:16,79
in, cutting the line.


213
0:10:16,79 --> 0:10:18,56
And then the swampers come.


214
0:10:18,56 --> 0:10:19,46
They clear everything out.


215
0:10:19,46 --> 0:10:21,661
And then the diggers
come in behind them


216
0:10:21,661 --> 0:10:23,649
and do a fire line.


217
0:10:23,649 --> 0:10:28,619



218
0:10:28,619 --> 0:10:31,104
TIM HENAGIN: They're about
two minutes into it.


219
0:10:31,104 --> 0:10:31,975
THOMAS: Yeah?


220
0:10:31,975 --> 0:10:33,64
And you keep doing this
for how long?


221
0:10:33,64 --> 0:10:35,84
TIM HENAGIN: 16 hours,
sometimes.


222
0:10:35,84 --> 0:10:37,9
THOMAS: Oh my god.


223
0:10:37,9 --> 0:10:40,7



224
0:10:40,7 --> 0:10:42,88
This is extraordinarily
hard work.


225
0:10:42,88 --> 0:10:46,8
It's impossible to keep my
eye on where I'm hitting


226
0:10:46,8 --> 0:10:48,5
and where I'm going.


227
0:10:48,5 --> 0:10:50,53



228
0:10:50,53 --> 0:10:53,206
And that's with no fire
in front of me.


229
0:10:53,206 --> 0:10:54,595
TIM HENAGIN: In the oak.


230
0:10:54,595 --> 0:10:58,31



231
0:10:58,31 --> 0:11:0,424
What do you think?


232
0:11:0,424 --> 0:11:4,1
THOMAS: That's a
bit laborious.


233
0:11:4,1 --> 0:11:10,58
That's about, like, a 50th
of your average shift?


234
0:11:10,58 --> 0:11:11,72
TIM HENAGIN: Oh,
yeah, at least.


235
0:11:11,72 --> 0:11:15,946
That was probably,
six minutes.


236
0:11:15,946 --> 0:11:18,85
THOMAS: How much distance
did we cover?


237
0:11:18,85 --> 0:11:20,48
TIM HENAGIN: 100 feet, maybe.


238
0:11:20,48 --> 0:11:23,1
Seven hours, we'll do
10,000 plus feet.


239
0:11:23,1 --> 0:11:24,56
THOMAS: 100 times that.


240
0:11:24,56 --> 0:11:26,46
CRAIG FRANCISCO: We started
getting it pretty good right


241
0:11:26,46 --> 0:11:27,24
before we quit.


242
0:11:27,24 --> 0:11:30,57
We were spaced out perfect.


243
0:11:30,57 --> 0:11:31,57
MALE SPEAKER: Having fun?


244
0:11:31,57 --> 0:11:32,88
TIM HENAGIN: Not bad,
for a rookie, Tom.


245
0:11:32,88 --> 0:11:34,4
THOMAS: Thank you.


246
0:11:34,4 --> 0:11:37,258
TIM HENAGIN: We'd take
you on the crew.


247
0:11:37,258 --> 0:11:40,32
THOMAS: I'd be short-lived,
I think.


248
0:11:40,32 --> 0:11:42,87
TIM HENAGIN: Oh, you'd
be surprised.


249
0:11:42,87 --> 0:11:45,8
I've been working in the
woods all my life.


250
0:11:45,8 --> 0:11:47,32
I started out logging.


251
0:11:47,32 --> 0:11:50,2
It's like coming full
circle for me.


252
0:11:50,2 --> 0:11:54,61
I've cut the trees down, the
big timber, and set the


253
0:11:54,61 --> 0:11:57,2
chokers, hauled them out of the
woods, and done a little


254
0:11:57,2 --> 0:11:59,3
bit of planting.


255
0:11:59,3 --> 0:12:2,16
Now I'm back thinning
it out and helping


256
0:12:2,16 --> 0:12:5,13
prevent the wild fires.


257
0:12:5,13 --> 0:12:10,21
You want to use back here-- from
here back on your saw.


258
0:12:10,21 --> 0:12:11,25
THOMAS: Never at the tip.


259
0:12:11,25 --> 0:12:12,78
TIM HENAGIN: Yeah, the closer
you get to here when you're


260
0:12:12,78 --> 0:12:15,97
limbing, the more chance
you have of kickback.


261
0:12:15,97 --> 0:12:17,95
And remember, you always
want to wrap this


262
0:12:17,95 --> 0:12:20,36
thumb around the handlebar.


263
0:12:20,36 --> 0:12:22,2
Don't cut with it up
there like that.


264
0:12:22,2 --> 0:12:24,0
You have no control
of the kickback.


265
0:12:24,0 --> 0:12:25,9
This will come right
out of your hand.


266
0:12:25,9 --> 0:12:27,78
When you grab that chainsaw
you mold onto it.


267
0:12:27,78 --> 0:12:31,31
It becomes part of your body.


268
0:12:31,31 --> 0:12:34,63
One of the things that turns
my stomach the most is the


269
0:12:34,63 --> 0:12:36,99
chainsaw cut.


270
0:12:36,99 --> 0:12:39,625
It cuts quick and to the bone,
and when it stops, those teeth


271
0:12:39,625 --> 0:12:40,875
pull everything out.


272
0:12:40,875 --> 0:12:43,7



273
0:12:43,7 --> 0:12:46,76
And then just imagine
doing that all day.


274
0:12:46,76 --> 0:12:49,63
The key to happiness out
here is a sharp chain.


275
0:12:49,63 --> 0:12:54,756



276
0:12:54,756 --> 0:12:55,688
THOMAS: Down we go.


277
0:12:55,688 --> 0:12:57,95
SHANE STANCLIFF: Good job.


278
0:12:57,95 --> 0:13:0,3
Now the fun part.


279
0:13:0,3 --> 0:13:2,47
THOMAS: I am sore and sweaty
and ant-bitten.


280
0:13:2,47 --> 0:13:5,2



281
0:13:5,2 --> 0:13:7,456
I've got sawdust in my mouth.


282
0:13:7,456 --> 0:13:11,827
I've got chips under
my eyelids.


283
0:13:11,827 --> 0:13:15,74
I've got weird, vibrationally
numbed


284
0:13:15,74 --> 0:13:18,105
fingers form the chainsaw.


285
0:13:18,105 --> 0:13:21,3
I feel very good about myself,
though, because I've done an


286
0:13:21,3 --> 0:13:22,44
honest day's work.


287
0:13:22,44 --> 0:13:25,155
Helping the forest and keeping
people from having their


288
0:13:25,155 --> 0:13:29,652
houses burned down is a pretty
good way to spend your time.


289
0:13:29,652 --> 0:13:31,21
Also gets you in decent shape.


290
0:13:31,21 --> 0:13:40,47



291
0:13:40,47 --> 0:13:44,34
Firefighters around the world
are universally acclaimed and


292
0:13:44,34 --> 0:13:45,38
considered heroes.


293
0:13:45,38 --> 0:13:47,73
Forest firefighters, though,
are kind of in a league to


294
0:13:47,73 --> 0:13:49,26
themselves.


295
0:13:49,26 --> 0:13:52,94
They basically go into
one of the deadliest


296
0:13:52,94 --> 0:13:54,83
situations in nature--


297
0:13:54,83 --> 0:13:59,14
something that we've all been
instinctually hard-wired to


298
0:13:59,14 --> 0:14:3,27
avoid on sight or smell,
no matter what--


299
0:14:3,27 --> 0:14:6,38
and get right up against the
flames and then do one of the


300
0:14:6,38 --> 0:14:9,562
hardest jobs imaginable, which
is digging a ditch.


301
0:14:9,562 --> 0:14:12,95
It's some of the hardest
work I think exists.


302
0:14:12,95 --> 0:16:12,95
