###11 SHANE SMITH: So is the fight over now?
###13 BEN ANDERSON: We think it might be, but that happened
###16 many, many times throughout the day.
###17 You think you can rest and it's over, and then they pop
###18 up and attack again.
###20 
###24 Now the ANA are sitting down inside the little sort of
###28 courtyard next to the compound here, and getting stoned.
###32 SHANE SMITH: The first thing they do in the break in the
###34 fighting is the ANA go get stoned.
###35 BEN ANDERSON: Yeah.
###36 SHANE SMITH: Are they getting stoned on opium, or are they
###38 getting stoned on hash, or pot, or?
###39 BEN ANDERSON: They smoke a lot of hash.
###41 We don't know if it was hash or opium, but it
###42 was one or the other.
###44 SHANE SMITH: That guy looks pinned.
###46 That's opium for sure.
###48 MALE SPEAKER: I don't understand how they could
###48 smoke it in the middle of a battle.
###51 They make you worse, but they love it.
###52 As soon as they get two minutes, they fucking have
###54 their-- start smoking it, and passing it around, all
###57 laughing and joking.
###58 And then a minute later, they're
###59 running out towards bullets.
###61 [AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE NEARBY]
###72 [LAUGHTER]
###73 BEN ANDERSON: He was so stoned that he went outside, stood up
###76 in full view of the Taliban, aimed just into the sky.
###79 A bullet fired the magazine off his gun.
###82 And he just picked it up off the ground, laughed, and
###84 walked back inside.
###85 
###88 [AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE]
###90 MALE SPEAKER: He's fucking mad.
###91 MALE SPEAKER: Why?
###92 MALE SPEAKER: Tajimad.
###92 We haven't got enough ammunition to
###94 fire bursts like that.
###96 Short bursts.
###97 Short bursts.
###100 MALE SPEAKER: Same question from the captain.
###101 Are they firing at anything?
###103 MALE SPEAKER: No.
###103 BEN ANDERSON: That happened all the time.
###105 You'd hear this massive burst of gunfire, and hear one of
###107 the Brits go, are they shooting at anything?
###108 And you'd hear someone shout back, no.
###110 We saw that time and time again.
###113 MALE SPEAKER: If you can't clearly identify the enemy,
###115 you shouldn't be firing, really.
###116 But trying to tell the ANA that is a different matter.
###123 BEN ANDERSON: Is that all the ammo you've got left?
###125 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, it's all we've got left.
###126 We've got about 150 rounds left.
###128 But I think we've got to go out there about another K for
###130 our resupply route.
###131 SHANE SMITH: So you're running low on ammunition now.
###132 BEN ANDERSON: Yeah, he's got 150 rounds left.
###135 MALE SPEAKER: We need to start bringing in resupplies of
###137 water, food, and especially ammunition.
###140 Because we're running low, yeah.
###142 MALE SPEAKER: Boys are low on water now.
###144 But we knew it was going to happen.
###146 We only carry 3 liters per man.
###149 It isn't going to last long.
###150 We've been on the go since half through this morning, so
###152 11 o'clock.
###152 So yeah, 3 liters isn't a lot, especially when you're
###155 sweating as much as this.
###156 SHANE SMITH: How hot is it right now here?
###158 BEN ANDERSON: Over 50 degrees.
###159 SHANE SMITH: It's over 50 degrees.
###160 Which is like, I don't know, 120 degrees or 115 degrees
###163 Fahrenheit.
###164 But you're wearing flak jackets and helmets.
###167 So your balls are sweating pretty bad right now.
###168 BEN ANDERSON: Dripping.
###169 SHANE SMITH: Dripping.
###170 And you don't have any water.
###171 BEN ANDERSON: No, the water runs out.
###173 Because you know, how much water can you carry on top of
###175 all that kit?
###175 SHANE SMITH: So you're fucked.
###177 BEN ANDERSON: Yeah, all of us.
###179 [AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE NEARBY]
###185 MALE SPEAKER: Hey Six-Three-Alpha, ICOM chatter
###187 suggests Taliban are pulling back in front of our advance,
###191 trying to conserve their own ammunition, cause us to expend
###194 all of ours, and then plan to
###196 counterattack us as we withdraw.
###198 Over.
###199 SHANE SMITH: So what the Taliban are doing now is
###201 they'll shoot a couple shots, get the ANA guys to go crazy,
###205 stoned, shoot all their guns off.
###207 And then when you have to retreat to get more bullets,
###210 they're going to kill you.
###210 BEN ANDERSON: Yeah.
###211 Yeah, that could be the Taliban's tactic for the
###213 entire country.
###214 You know, they know it doesn't cost much for them to stay
###216 there and stay fighting.
###218 They know it costs Britain and America and everybody else a
###220 lot to be there.
###222 So they think they can outpace us, no problem at all.
###224 They'll say, we'll fight for 10 years, like me and you
###227 would say, let's go for a drink, let's go
###228 for a game of tennis.
###230 It's nothing.
###231 
###235 MALE SPEAKER: But be aware of that.
###236 Don't come down below 5,000.
###238 [DISTANT GUNFIRE]
###244 [LAUGHTER]
###246 MALE SPEAKER: Fucking spread out!
###247 MALE SPEAKER: Right, gentlemen.
###248 MALE SPEAKER: Just keep coming forward!
###250 [BULLETS SNAPPING]
###251 BEN ANDERSON: Hear that popping sound?
###253 That's not guns being fired.
###254 That's bullets breaking the sound barrier.
###256 And if you hear that sound, you're too close.
###258 You're like 3, 4 meters away from the bullet.
###260 And there's hundreds of those popping noises.
###263 MALE SPEAKER: You coming in?
###265 [LOUD SNAP]
###266 MALE SPEAKER: Jesus.
###267 BEN ANDERSON: So that's a bullet that just came through
###269 the door, and hit the wall somewhere inside and then
###271 covered us with dust.
###272 MALE SPEAKER: Get behind the wall.
###275 
###278 MALE SPEAKER: Now, once that target's destroyed, I'm hoping
###281 that this fire will stop.
###283 The air's coming in now.
###284 Wait out.
###285 BEN ANDERSON: They've called in some planes
###287 with 500-pound bombs.
###288 [JET ENGINE OVERHEAD]
###290 
###296 BEN ANDERSON: Exactly what I was just thinking.
###298 
###302 SHANE SMITH: So you just said, please don't land
###303 on me, to the bomb.
###304 BEN ANDERSON: Yeah.
###304 Yeah.
###307 [HUGE EXPLOSION]
###309 
###314 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I think he needs to go south.
###316 Yeah, he doesn't want to come any closer to us.
###318 
###324 BEN ANDERSON: So they called in a
###325 500-pound bomb, which missed.
###328 And it wasn't that far in front of this compound.
###331 And they'll try again--
###332 [BULLETS SNAPPING]
###332 BEN ANDERSON: --try again in about a minute.
###336 [HEAVY GUNFIRE NEARBY]
###347 SHANE SMITH: So the bomb didn't seem to hit them.
###349 They're still shooting at you.
###350 BEN ANDERSON: What happened there happened again and again
###352 and again throughout my two months there.
###354 Bombs get dropped, missiles, everything.
###356 It goes quiet for a minute, you think, that's it, that's
###358 got to be it.
###359 And then you hear them pop up and fire back again.
###361 I think they're just firing for--
###364 the British or ANA are trying to keep the Taliban in place.
###368 That way when the bomb lands, if they're still there, that
###371 should be the end in there.
###372 MALE SPEAKER: Six-One-Alpha, heads down.
###374 20 seconds.
###375 Out.
###376 [JET ENGINE OVERHEAD]
###379 [HUGE EXPLOSION]
###383 MALE SPEAKER: Probably has hit further east.
###385 BEN ANDERSON: That fell even closer than the last one.
###389 SHANE SMITH: So that's another bomb that they
###391 nearly hit you with.
###392 And then they nearly hit you again.
###393 BEN ANDERSON: Yeah, a bit closer than the last one.
###394 SHANE SMITH: That was closer than the last one.
###395 BEN ANDERSON: Yeah, yeah.
###397 MALE SPEAKER: We'll just stay firm here, away from all the
###399 casualties to be dealt with and got out.
###401 Tell them to bring the water forward, and give everyone a
###404 chance to have some water.
###405 And then we'll re-cock and go in for those final compounds,
###411 Whiskey and X-ray.
###413 [HEAVY GUNFIRE NEARBY]
###420 MALE SPEAKER: That's getting the water out there.
###424 BEN ANDERSON: So some guys went out to get some water.
###427 Came under heavy fire again.
###428 I think this time we've come under fire from that side and
###431 that side at the same time.
###432 We haven't come under fire from that side.
###434 So far it's total there.
###436 Normally when you hear fire like that, it's just because
###439 someone's stuck their head out, someone's
###440 shot, whatever it was.
###441 In this instance, guys had gone out to pick up water that
###444 had been dropped via helicopter.
###445 So it was all quiet as they went out to pick up the water.
###448 And then suddenly all hell breaks loose from 360 degrees.
###451 And we know there are guys out there, picking up this water.
###455 MALE SPEAKER: So we're short of water.
###456 Short of batteries.
###457 Plenty of ammunition.
###459 And plenty of Taliban.
###462 So yeah.
###463 All in all, good going, apart from the water.
###466 BEN ANDERSON: Seven guys collapsed by the end of this
###467 day, and some of them were in life-threatening conditions.
###470 I saw one guy actually collapse, and I thought it was
###473 trauma or shell shock or something, because I've never
###474 seen a guy--
###475 I mean, he took his top off.
###476 He tried to fight his friends, who were going to
###477 pour water on him.
###478 He collapsed like a boxer who has been knocked out.
###481 I didn't realize that heat exhaustion can be that bad.
###484 And plus, these guys are soldiers, so they're going to
###486 deny it to the last minute.
###487 They're going to pretend they're OK, and struggle on
###489 through until the very last minute, when
###490 it's almost too late.
###492 Despite what's happened, the day is far from over.
###494 MALE SPEAKER: Oh, far from over.
###496 This is just the beginning.
###497 This is just the beginning of a very busy day.
###500 Probably a couple of days, if not a week.
###503 BEN ANDERSON: Eventually the Taliban withdrew, and we just
###504 walked away.
###505 I don't know if they ran out of ammunition or something.
###506 They packed up and left, and it stayed quiet.
###509 And within a very short time of leaving that compound, we
###512 heard over the radios that the Taliban had retaken all of
###515 those buildings that had been fought for.
###516 
###525 MALE SPEAKER: I believe we're going to go north, go firm,
###529 put a defensive position in.
###531 And then we'll have a nice quiet night in the valley
###534 tonight, by the look of it.
###536 Not.
###537 BEN ANDERSON: If this small area of the valley takes this
###539 much of a fight to clear, how much is the whole province
###543 going to take?
###543 MALE SPEAKER: Well, the country being like it is-- and
###545 it's classic hit-and-run country.
###547 It's like Normandy, hedgerows, ditches,
###550 plowed fields, compounds.
###553 And these guys, they've got all the time in the world to
###555 set up what they want to set up, and where they want to be.
###557 Whereas we've got to advance into them to flush them out.
###559 So the whole province?
###561 Oh, I don't get paid enough to tell you that one.
###565 I don't know.
###566 I'm not going to guess.
###567 BEN ANDERSON: How old are you?
###568 MALE SPEAKER: 41 years old.
###570 And I was supposed to leave the army this year.
###572 And I was graciously offered two more years, and I took it.
###577 BEN ANDERSON: Is this your last tour?
###579 MALE SPEAKER: Probably yes, he says.
###580 But I did say that last year in Iraq, that that was going
###584 to be my last tour.
###585 And obviously it's not, so we'll see.
###587 We'll see what happens.
###588 MALE SPEAKER: Probably the biggest I've had in my career
###590 since I've been in, mate, in terms of contacts.
###594 I've been going since 0300 this morning.
###597 It's now 10 past 4:00 in the afternoon, 1610 hours.
###602 So it's been quite a long day.
###606 It's not over yet.
###607 We've still got to move off to our next location, and
###609 meet up with WFR.
###612 And then we'll see how we get from there.
###614 But the boys have worked their nuts off, as usual.
###615 So have the ANA.
###617 Everyone's worked really hard.
###619 BEN ANDERSON: So when he says, that's the most intense day
###621 I've ever had as a soldier, he's done tours of Iraq,
###624 Bosnia, Kosovo, Northern Ireland, Afghanistan.
###628 That's not said lightly when he says that.
###630 SHANE SMITH: Right.
###630 So Afghanistan has the fiercest fighting in
###633 the world right now.
###634 BEN ANDERSON: Yeah.
###634 I mean, the historians and these guys, they're all
###636 saying, the most ferocious fighting since the Korean War.
###640 MALE SPEAKER: Lucky today.
###640 We seemed to be near cover every time it come, didn't we?
###643 We're lucky.
###645 I'm surprised no one's a casualty today.
###647 BEN ANDERSON: Is it manpower?
###648 The reason you can't--
###649 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, it's manpower.
###650 We haven't got the manpower.
###651 There's not enough people out here.
###653 Now, they're out to fight.
###654 And it's very rare that you see them.
###656 But most people here ain't even seen a Taliban yet.
###659 SHANE SMITH: So they can fight the Taliban all day for 12
###661 hours, and they'll have never have seen them.
###663 BEN ANDERSON: You might see a bit of movement.
###664 You might see a flash of light from where
###666 they're firing from.
###667 That's it.
###668 And they probably have seen lots of Taliban when they're
###670 not fighting.
###671 SHANE SMITH: They just don't know it.
###672 BEN ANDERSON: They're in the villages and the towns.
###673 But how do you know?
###674 MALE SPEAKER: As soon as it starts getting a bit rough,
###675 and it looks they're going to get it, they'll fucking pick a
###677 pitchfork up, and they're Farmer Joe for the day.
###680 If someone's coming towards me on the same path,
###682 I'll cross the path.
###684 I don't want them to get nowhere near me.
###686 I want to go home.
###688 They're the kind of people that believe when they die,
###690 they're going to wake up with 27 virgins.
###694 So how can you fight against someone like that, who doesn't
###696 give a shit?
###698 It's like as soon as I die, I'll be
###699 going back to Tottenham.
###700 I'll fucking run at the bullets.
###702 BEN ANDERSON: And you regularly see guys that are
###704 just dumbfounded.
###704 Like, how can you fight against someone
###706 who wants to die?
###708 Who thinks that dying is an end, dying is a route to some
###710 kind of paradise?
###712 SHANE SMITH: So who is going to win that fight?
###713 BEN ANDERSON: People regularly talk about how the Americans
###715 and British always beat the Taliban when they
###717 meet them in a fight.
###718 That doesn't mean the Taliban are ever going to give up.
###721 That's the follow-up point that most people seem to miss.
###724 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, we'll come straight
###724 back today or tomorrow.
###725 But the thing is, because we've left it, we'll have to
###727 fucking start again.
###728 So that is just pointless, isn't it?
###730 I mean, we don't know what we're doing now.
###733 That's the hardest bit, not knowing.
###736 SHANE SMITH: You went in there.
###737 You fought all day.
###738 You got surrounded.
###739 People are dropping like flies from heat exhaustion.
###741 You nearly got bombed by your own guys three times.
###744 And then you had to leave, so the Taliban just went in.
###746 BEN ANDERSON: Yeah.
###747 He said we haven't got the manpower to hold on to land.
###749 And it's the same thing with the border with Pakistan.
###751 They just haven't got the manpower to either hold on to
###754 land or patrol borders properly.
###755 SHANE SMITH: So it's all for nothing.
###757 BEN ANDERSON: With existing levels of troops, yeah.
###759 
###763 MALE SPEAKER: I'd say yesterday was probably the
###766 hardest day I've had in 17 years' service.
###770 And I think all of the others who fought in it yesterday
###775 would probably agree.
###777 It was eight hours of unrelenting combat against a
###782 canny, wily, determined enemy, who was prepared to
###790 fight to the death.
###791 It's extremely difficult in the Green Zone to maneuver
###796 your forces.
###797 BEN ANDERSON: Is there a danger that by flattening
###800 compounds--
###801 and obviously civilians are going to get caught up in the
###803 compounds from time to time--
###805 that you could lose the support of the
###807 population here entirely?
###808 That they could either become indifferent to you being here,
###812 or worse, supporters and helpers of the Taliban?
###816 MALE SPEAKER: It's a fine line.
###819 I think if we were completely indiscriminate in our fires,
###823 then yes, we could lose support quite quickly.
###826 As it happens, yesterday there was an attack aviation strike
###830 on a compound which had civilians and my men in it.
###837 I was fortunate that none of them were injured.
###842 It was me.
###845 I directed that attack.
###849 I gave clearance for it to fire.
###852 And the responsibility for it lies on my shoulders.
###856 In this instance, I'm extremely lucky that there
###860 were no casualties, either friendly or civilian.
###864 SHANE SMITH: What do you think is happening in Afghanistan?
###867 BEN ANDERSON: I think that is happening on
###868 a much wider scale.
###870 There's no evidence that the Taliban are even thinking
###873 about giving up.
###875 There's no evidence that a military solution is possible.
###878 And there's no evidence that the Brits or the Americans or
###880 anyone can control anything apart from these isolated
###883 bases and towns.
###884 So the Taliban have complete free rein, especially over the
###886 south of Afghanistan.
###887 SHANE SMITH: So we went in to kick the Taliban out.
###889 The Taliban are getting stronger and stronger.
###891 There's more drugs coming out than ever before.
###894 Why are we there?
###895 BEN ANDERSON: The most discouraging thing I've seen
###898 or heard from Afghanistan recently is when I was there,
###900 one town was left that was under control of the Taliban.
###903 That was taken just after I left.
###905 They put in charge a guy who's Taliban.
###908 He soon described himself as good Taliban.
###910 Yeah, that makes you think, why have we been fighting and
###912 losing people for six years, when we could have done
###914 exactly the same deal that we've done
###915 today, six years ago?
###918 [BIRDS TWITTERING]
