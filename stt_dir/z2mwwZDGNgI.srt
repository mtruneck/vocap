1
0:0:18,35 --> 0:0:21,868
My life is in stages, you know what I
mean?


2
0:0:21,868 --> 0:0:25,695
We the jury of in the above-entitled action, find the defendent
Calvin Broadus


3
0:0:25,695 --> 0:0:29,235
not guilty of the crime of murder in
the first degree.


4
0:0:29,235 --> 0:0:32,263
Whether it's me performing live on
stage...


5
0:0:32,263 --> 0:0:36,17
Let me hear you say "Snoop Dogg!"
-Snoop Dogg!


6
0:0:36,17 --> 0:0:39,203
Or me going through stages in life.


7
0:0:39,203 --> 0:0:42,136
That's what my life has always been
based on.


8
0:0:42,136 --> 0:0:52,431
And that's what forced me to find
a new path.


9
0:0:52,431 --> 0:0:55,363
Snoop Dogg is still in Jamaica,


10
0:0:55,363 --> 0:0:59,4
observing and participating in
authentic Jamaican culture.


11
0:0:59,4 --> 0:1:6,766
The prodigal son returns.


12
0:1:6,766 --> 0:1:10,373
I've been on the top ever since I've
been in it.


13
0:1:10,373 --> 0:1:14,641
I've got rap songs that will never
die.


14
0:1:14,641 --> 0:1:19,41
I think with no disrespect, but,
I'm tired of rapping.


15
0:1:19,41 --> 0:1:22,975
I wanna do a record, a whole record,
with no rapping.


16
0:1:22,975 --> 0:1:27,68
Fuck Snoop Dogg. Don't think about
none of the shit he rapped about,


17
0:1:27,68 --> 0:1:30,635
hustling and making money and drug
dealing and shooting.


18
0:1:30,635 --> 0:1:43,545
All that shit be out of here.


19
0:1:43,545 --> 0:1:46,605
I didn't just wanna come here, say I
made a record in Jamaica


20
0:1:46,605 --> 0:1:47,911
and grew some dreadlocks.


21
0:1:47,911 --> 0:1:58,46
Rastafari called me.


22
0:1:58,46 --> 0:2:1,48
I finally made it to paradise.


23
0:2:1,48 --> 0:2:3,646
Bless up - Snoop Lion!


24
0:2:3,646 --> 0:2:5,573
Jah said to love thee one to another


25
0:2:5,573 --> 0:2:10,148
for him that loveth is of Jah!


26
0:2:10,148 --> 0:4:10,148
<i>Come hit some of this Californian [weed] one
time. Calm your nerves!</i>
