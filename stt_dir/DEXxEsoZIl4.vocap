###32 Sid Roth has spent over 35 years researching the strange world of
###38 the supernatural.
###41 Join Sid for this edition of It's Supernatural!
###50 Sid: Hello.
###53 Sid Roth here.
###54 Welcome to my world where it's naturally supernatural.
###58 I'm so excited about this show.
###62 My guest is going to teach you the missing message of Jesus.
###69 It's there.
###71 It is in the Gospels.
###73 But it's missing today, and that is Jesus came to heal the broken
###81 hearted.
###82 And you see, you can't get everything God promises to you
###88 if you have a broken heart.
###89 And it's my conviction in a broken world with a broken
###93 devil, with broken people, how do you expect to have a healed
###98 heart unless Jesus heals your heart.
###106 Now have you ever felt that something is wrong and you don't
###112 know what it is.
###113 What a frustrating feeling.
###115 That's what happened to my friend John McTernan.
###118 John, what was going on in your life?
###121 You're a believer.
###122 You're speaking before people.
###124 You're not supposed to have a problem, but you do.
###129 What's your problem?
###130 John: Sid, it's internal and it's kind of hard to explain.
###133 But I felt a drag side.
###135 I felt like a car going down the road on the interstate at 65
###140 miles an hour at all sorts of power, speed, and yet it was
###144 holding back.
###145 There was a power drain inside of me.
###148 I could feel it.
###148 I knew something was wrong.
###150 I had brought it before the Lord for many, many years, and it
###154 just sat there.
###156 It didn't go.
###157 I had no idea what it was.
###158 Sid: Okay.
###159 So one day he's minding his own business, listening to a radio
###163 program and the light bulb went on.
###166 What happened?
###167 John: There was a woman being interviewed about, she was a
###170 psychologist, Christian psychologist, and she's being
###173 interviewed by her research on children of divorce and how
###179 every one of them, virtually every one of them had a broken
###182 heart, and it affected them where the developed loneliness.
###186 That was an outstanding trait of a broken heart of a child from a
###191 divorced family.
###192 And it was like, bingo, my parents were divorced.
###195 I didn't even know them together.
###197 They were divorced before I could remember.
###199 And I began to think, and I'm saying, broken heart, maybe
###203 that's what I have.
###205 And I sought the Lord about it, and I prayed, and at that point,
###210 I didn't know I had a broken heart.
###211 And if you, Sid, had come to me like let's say years before that
###216 and you said, "John, I didn't know you had a broken heart," I
###218 would go, how?
###220 How would it be broken?
###221 I had no idea at all.
###224 And when I sought the Lord Sid: You know, I'm reminded the Bible
###226 says, "The heart is the most deceitful thing."
###230 Here he is a believer with a broken heart and he's so
###236 programmed to operate with that broken heart he doesn't even
###240 know it's broken.
###241 John: That's exactly right, Sid.
###242 That's exactly right.
###243 So I knew Luke 4:18.
###245 And in Luke 4:18, that is the ministry of Jesus Christ.
###249 And we all know that he came to save us from sin.
###253 Right?
###253 Sid: Of course.
###254 John: But it doesn't end there.
###256 When you look at Luke 4:18, it says, "And he came to heal the
###260 broken hearted, to deliver the captives, to open the eyes of
###263 the blind and to set at liberty them that are bruised."
###267 We stop right at the salvation message.
###270 But if you look in the Bible, there's a semi-colon, and right
###273 after it, it says, "The Lord came to heal the broken
###276 hearted."
###277 Sid: There are many other areas that some have had a broken
###280 heart of.
###281 I mean, a divorced home, that's enough.
###283 But there are a lot of other areas, like what?
###286 John: Sid, rejection, especially with children.
###289 I have come to see it's much easier than we realize to break
###294 a child's heart.
###295 Their heart is very tender and it's very easy to break a
###299 child's heart.
###300 But rejection, death.
###303 Death can really break a heart.
###305 I have found with women, abortion, devastating with
###310 breaking the heart.
###311 Physical abuse, sexual abuse, the military with men, women in
###315 the military now also.
###317 But that, what they see and what happens can break their heart.
###320 We call it like post-stress, you know, the trauma and much of
###327 that is really a broken heart.
###329 Sid: But you know what?
###330 Just the peer pressure of a young child going to school and
###334 maybe they're not so pretty, and maybe they hear someone laughing
###337 at them, they say nothing.
###339 But in a child's mind, that's enough to do it.
###343 So what was the revelation you had when you started praying?
###346 John: My mother had remarried.
###347 Now there is no way on my own I could remember this, because
###352 we're going back now to when I was six years old.
###354 And my stepfather, I don't think, I know he didn't do this
###360 to be malicious.
###361 But he approached when I was about six years old about being
###365 adopted, and I had no idea what he was talking about.
###367 Sid: You thought he was your natural father?
###369 John: No, no.
###371 I had, my father would come and visit me, and he was a good
###374 friend.
###375 I knew him as Joe.
###376 I didn't call him Dad or anything.
###378 I knew him as Joe.
###379 And my stepfather wanted to block out my father from coming,
###384 and he talked to me about adoption.
###386 I had no idea what he was talking about.
###388 Finally, it dawned on me.
###390 I had like a revelation that Joe was my father and this man was
###394 my stepfather.
###395 And I remember I said to him... Child: When my name change, can
###401 I still see Joe?
###404 Man No, you'll have my name.
###406 Child: No.
###408 My name John McTernan.
###411 John: And I knew right then and there the whole thing opened up.
###414 I understood perfectly at six years old and I knew if I told
###418 my father he would protect me from what was going on.
###422 It was a complete revelation, but it broke my heart.
###426 Sid: Hold that thought.
###427 When we come back, we're going to find out what God did that so
###432 changed his life, that people don't even recognize him.
###438 He doesn't even recognize himself after his heart is
###443 healed by God Himself.
###445 But better than that, how about having your broken heart healed.
###450 Don't go away.
###454 We'll be right back to It's Supernatural!
###489 We now return to It's Supernatural!
###497 Sid: I mean, what a devastating thing.
###501 A young boy, the one that's been with him his whole life that he
###507 thinks is his father and he knew his natural father, but he
###512 didn't know him as "father".
###514 And his father brings him, in the basement and tells him the
###518 truth.
###519 How old were you?
###520 John: I figured about six.
###521 Sid: At six, what affect did it have on you?
###524 John: From that moment on I did not want to live with my mother
###528 and my stepfather.
###529 I wanted to be with my dad.
###530 And it brought in, it developed that spirit of loneliness was
###534 deep with me.
###535 I had, it was a supernatural spiritual loneliness.
###539 It brought a feeling of rejection in.
###541 It actually brought fear into me because I remember I was afraid
###545 he would try that again.
###548 And I never was, from that day on, I was never comfortable in
###552 the family.
###553 And it devastated me inside as a little six year old.
###557 And that was that problem.
###558 It broke my heart at six and it carried over when I came to
###563 believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
###565 Sid: Okay.
###566 You have the revelation that you have a broken heart.
###570 You now realize when it happened.
###574 John: Yes.
###575 Sid: You know exactly.
###576 What did you do about it?
###577 John: I cried out to the Lord to heal my heart.
###579 And Sid, it took me with the Lord about two or three weeks of
###584 prayer.
###585 And I can remember laying in bed at night with tears rolling down
###589 out of my eyes with this feeling of loneliness and emptiness, and
###595 it got to the point where I realized then that I know why a
###600 spouse will die like within a year after a spouse passes away.
###605 Sid: I've noticed that pattern.
###607 John: That loneliness, that's what I actually felt.
###611 It felt like I was dying.
###612 That's how severe it was.
###614 And then I cried out and I said, "Lord, if I die over this then I
###618 go to be with you, but I'm staying and I'm believing you're
###621 going to heal my heart."
###622 And literally, I could feel relief.
###624 It like came like that.
###627 It just came like up and out.
###629 Sid: It sounds easy, John.
###631 John: Well those two weeks, three weeks leading up to it,
###634 for me, was not easy.
###636 But the Lord delivered.
###637 I began a whole new man.
###640 That emergency brake feeling came off.
###643 Sid: But what about that fear, the loneliness, the loneliness
###648 you explained, the rejection, what about those things?
###651 John: I began to see how I operated in my life.
###655 One of the healing, one of the ministries of Jesus Christ is to
###659 open the eyes of the blind.
###661 And all of a sudden I began to see like now that my heart was
###666 healed actions that I did to protect that heart, and also the
###671 way I interacted with people with the fear of rejection and
###674 not wanting to be rejected, and things I said, and things.
###677 There was a whole complete revelation and I began to
###680 confess it to the Lord and say, "Lord, I'm not living with fear
###684 anymore."
###685 I didn't even know it was there.
###686 Sid: I heard a man once say, God never sets you free of your
###690 friends.
###691 He sets you free of your enemies.
###692 And he had no idea there was an enemy called fear.
###697 But this is the amazing thing.
###699 Once the heart is restored then these other critters that are
###705 enemies, they literally have to go.
###708 John: That's right.
###709 Sid: It's so wonderful.
###710 But tell me when the Bible talks about the ministry of Jesus was
###716 to restore the broken hearted, what does the word "broken" mean
###721 in Hebrew?
###722 John: That's a real good question.
###723 And it's actually Hebrew and Greek really mean the same
###725 thing.
###726 It means a violent shattering.
###729 There's the word "violent".
###730 And it's like you have like this glass here and I took it and I
###734 just didn't drop it, but I threw it down on the ground.
###737 Sid: There would be no way to restore that.
###739 John: It splinters apart and that is what the Bible describes
###743 as a broken heart.
###744 And Sid, there is nothing human on this earth that can heal a
###749 broken heart.
###750 It can only be, it's supernatural, it can only be
###752 healed by Jesus Christ.
###754 That's his ministry.
###756 Sid: Tell me about the woman with ulcerated colitis.
###762 John: Well what happened, Sid, is when my heart was healed, all
###767 of a sudden I would come in contact with people and in my
###772 mind I would hear, I would look at you for example and I'd hear
###776 "broken hearted, broken hearted".
###777 And I would go up to you very politely, I just didn't yell at
###782 you.
###782 I'd say, "Excuse me, but I believe the Lord is telling me
###786 you have a broken heart."
###787 And people would start crying and it was amazing.
###790 The Lord is putting people across my path who need to be
###793 ministered to.
###795 So this ministry started to develop, just happened when I'd
###799 see instant results.
###801 Sometimes the results would take a while, but instant results.
###804 And this one woman had a powerful spirit of rejection.
###808 It happened when she was about five or six years old, just like
###811 you mentioned, rejected by kids, and all her life this rejection
###816 just continued.
###818 She had two husbands that left her and they liked divorced her
###822 on a Friday, and then married another woman on a Monday.
###825 And that, she was just, she had a like self-hatred of herself.
###830 And when I ministered to her about the broken heart it was
###835 very hard for her to receive that God loved her because of
###839 her broken heart.
###840 Even though she believed in the Lord, I know that this sounds
###843 weird, but that's what happens with a broken heart.
###845 Jesus was her savior.
###847 But the reality of calling God, Abba Father, she couldn't do it.
###852 She said, "I can't do it."
###853 It took a couple prayer sessions.
###855 And she ulcerated colitis where about four or five years she was
###861 in the final stage of it.
###862 I mean, it was critical.
###863 She was anemic, bleeding severely.
###864 Finally, she broke through with Abba Father, her heart was
###870 healed and that point my ministry, now what I do is if
###873 someone has physical issues, when I pray with them for a
###877 broken heart, we also pray for the physical issue.
###880 Because a lot of times the physical issue is caused by the
###884 broken heart, the fear and anxiety, and tension.
###889 So we prayed and her ulcerated intestines were healed right
###894 there on the spot.
###895 Sid: Once the heart is healed, the emotions get healed.
###899 The physical body gets healed.
###900 John: Yes.
###901 Sid: John has even gone into mental institutions in hopeless
###904 cases.
###905 One of the most hopeless cases they had in a mental institution
###909 was her heart was healed, she was healed.
###912 But I'll tell you what, I want you to pray a supernatural
###918 prayer with John, because this is what he found out.
###921 The gift is growing.
###922 The same thing happened with me.
###924 I started laying hands on people and they got physically healed.
###927 Then I started speaking it, not even laying hands, and they got
###931 just as healed.
###934 I'll have him pray for you when we come back.
###939 We'll be right back to It's Supernatural!
###1033 We now return to It's Supernatural!
###1042 Sid: Now we find out in the Bible amazing supernatural
###1048 blessings that God has given to Abraham.
###1052 But there's a tie-in between a heart being broken and receiving
###1058 these supernatural blessings.
###1061 There is, like with John, there is a disconnect and many people
###1065 don't understand this.
###1066 Explain that.
###1068 John: When our heart is healed, it puts us in a new relationship
###1072 with God.
###1073 It's like when you have an earthly father and you're afraid
###1078 of him for whatever reason, you shy back, you're afraid to talk
###1082 to him, you're afraid to ask him.
###1084 Well with a broken heart, that can carry over towards our
###1087 attitude.
###1088 And God tells us to call him "Abba Father".
###1090 And those attitudes towards an earthly father, we can project
###1094 towards God.
###1095 But he's not like that towards us.
###1097 So a broken heart can break the feeling, or block the feeling of
###1102 how much God loves us, how much He wants to bless us, and also
###1105 the ministry of Lord Jesus is to open the eyes of the blind.
###1110 So once our heart is healed, Sid, it's a progression.
###1113 Salvation, healing of the heart, setting the captives free,
###1118 opening the eyes of the blind and then setting at liberty them
###1121 that are bruised, it's a progression of what God does in
###1125 our life.
###1126 So when our heart is healed and we're set free, all of a sudden
###1130 there's no blockage between us and Abba Father, and we believe
###1135 that He'll bless us then.
###1137 Sid: So very briefly, will you tell me, I mean, John gets calls
###1142 from people that have loved ones in mental institutions.
###1146 Tell me about one.
###1148 John: A friend of mine asked me to minister to his sister who
###1152 was believer, and she has been in and out of the psychiatric
###1155 ward for severe depression.
###1157 She had been there, she's in her 60's, she had been in there now
###1161 for three months.
###1162 And didn't know she was in there for three months.
###1163 Sid: How bad was the depression?
###1165 John: The doctor said it was the worst he's ever seen.
###1168 They were thinking of permanently institutionalizing
###1171 her.
###1172 When I visited her and I looked at her, Sid, if you could see
###1175 depression, that was her.
###1177 I mean, you could like cut it or touch her with depression.
###1181 And there's a Bible right next to her.
###1183 So I began to talk to her and she said, "I've been prayed over
###1188 and so many people prayed over me, and I've gone to Christian
###1192 psychologists."
###1193 I said, "Did anyone ever pray for you for a broken heart?"
###1196 And she went like this and she said, "No, never."
###1199 I said, "That's the problem."
###1201 Terry was her name.
###1202 So we got into her background.
###1204 When she was 16 years old she had a child out of wedlock.
###1208 The child died and it ruptured her family, relationship with
###1213 her family that destroyed her inside, and she went on a path
###1216 of rejection and depression into the psychiatric ward.
###1221 So we prayed and she forgave what happened, she believed the
###1226 baby died because of what she did.
###1229 Then she believed God punished her by taking the baby.
###1232 She had a grudge towards God.
###1234 She had to forgive herself.
###1236 She had to forgive her parents.
###1238 When that all came and then we prayed, Sid, the greatest, for
###1243 me personally, I think miracle I had ever seen, her continence
###1247 changed.
###1251 She had this glow to the point where people in the psychiatric
###1257 ward were saying to her, "What happened to you?
###1259 You look so different."
###1261 My friend said to me, "You did like a magic act.
###1264 His name was John."
###1265 I said, "What are you talking about?"
###1267 He said, "That's not my sister."
###1269 He goes, "I don't know who she is."
###1272 He goes, "I've never seen anything like this from the
###1274 depression to the joy."
###1276 And they released her from the hospital, and she now is leading
###1280 a normal life.
###1281 The whole problem was a broken heart.
###1285 Sid: Okay.
###1286 Will you pray as God instructs for those that are watching,
###1290 because I know that this is what you've been crying out to God
###1295 for.
###1296 John: Yes.
###1297 Father, we come before you in the awesome name of Jesus.
###1300 And Lord, we bring the listeners before you and the key on their
###1305 part is forgiveness, to forgive those that broke their heart,
###1308 forgive themselves and maybe possibly we be reconciled with
###1313 you from a grudge.
###1315 Father, once that's done, I pray now that in the name of Jesus
###1319 you take that shattered, broken, splintered heart and put it
###1324 together, make it solid, make it one according to your word, and
###1328 bind it with the power and the love of the Holy Spirit, never
###1333 to be broken again.
###1335 And bring the healing that comes with that, Father, the healing
###1338 from fear and depression, and anxiety, and rejection where we
###1343 can call you Abba Father and walk in love with you.
###1347 And then, Father, we ask for the flow as the heart is healed,
###1351 Lord, that issues like high blood pressure, heart problems,
###1355 ulcerated colitis, Lord, fibromyalgia, all sorts of
###1361 things that are triggered by the tension inside, the anxiety
###1365 inside, the fear inside, Lord, that your natural healing virtue
###1369 would flow through their bodies, and they be released and healed
###1373 of these diseases and maladies.
###1375 In Jesus' name I ask.
###1376 Amen.
###1377 Sid: Amen.
###1379 Now I can tell this.
###1381 There is a requirement in the Kingdom.
###1384 It came from our teacher, our Lord, the Messiah of Israel,
###1389 Jesus, the Anointed One.
###1392 And this is what he says: "I will forgive you to the same
###1397 degree, the same amount that you forgive other people."
###1401 So how much do you want God to forgive you, 95 percent?
###1404 You say, I don't feel like it.
###1405 I don't deserve it.
###1410 Doesn't count.
###1411 Meaningless.
###1414 God says, if you confess your sins He is just and faithful to
###1421 forgive you of all unrighteousness and
###1425 unforgiveness is a sin that blocks the hand of God.
###1430 Unforgiveness is taking the arsenic you want your enemy to
###1438 take.
###1439 Stop it.
###1440 Come to your senses.
###1441 It's an act of your will.
###1443 It's not a feeling.
###1444 It's not emotion.
###1445 So don't tell me you can't do it.
###1446 You can do it.
###1447 You want to please the Living God.
###1449 There's no one else that you need to please.
###1452 Please Him.
###1453 Tell Him you choose to forgive that person out loud in Jesus'
###1459 name and don't look back.
###1461 And I'm going to tell you something.
###1463 Now does it mean you have to trust them?
###1466 Not until they earn it.
###1468 But you can forgive them.
###1470 I'm telling you, you can, because I have.
###1473 And then ask Jesus to forgive you of everything you've ever
###1478 done and say, "Jesus, I make you my Lord.
###1483 Come inside of me.
###1485 Take over my life.
###1488 I love you, Lord."
###1490 And then I pray that you experience the tangible presence
###1495 of the love of the Living God, in Jesus' name.
###1687 Sid: Next week on It's Supernatural!
