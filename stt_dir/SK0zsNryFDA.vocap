###38 CRAIG COSTELLO: I never studied painting.
###40 All my experience with putting paint on
###43 something came from graffiti.
###45 And the kind of graffiti I did was always really simple.
###50 As I started to paint in a studio, I would paint these
###55 letters and straight lines and everything.
###59 And I would try to make it perfect, and it
###61 just drove me insane.
###62 
###68 I grew up in New York.
###69 I'm from Queens, Forest Hills.
###72 And I grew up, I was a teenager in the '80s, and I
###81 was into skating and everything from hardcore to
###88 hip-hop, punk rock.
###90 I grew up in a culture of like, you stole your paint,
###93 you wrote illegally, you made your own markers, or you found
###99 your own caps.
###101 And you took care of them, and it was all tools.
###104 And you had to learn and understand
###108 everything on your own.
###109 Like this cap was good for this, or this paint was no
###112 good, or whatever it was.
###114 
###124 When I started just doing drips on doors or mailboxes, I
###128 got a lot of positive feedback.
###130 People were really interested in it, they thought it was
###132 really cool.
###134 The fire extinguishers is something that I didn't invent
###137 it, I wasn't the first one to use it for those means.
###140 But it was another example of reappropriating something to
###144 basically use as a tool.
###146 It acted very similarly to the markers that I made.
###151 I moved to San Francisco.
###153 I went to school for photography.
###155 I lived there from '92 to '98.
###157 I don't know, it was easier to get materials.
###161 So from a graffiti sense, paint was more accessible,
###164 markers were more accessible, all kinds of things were more
###167 accessible to me.
###168 Because in New York, stuff is so locked down.
###171 I probably started making Krink around '93,
###175 and that was it.
###175 There's was no business plan, there was no T-shirt company,
###181 there was no street art.
###184 It was just friends and having a good time.
###188 I was able to have my own aesthetic on the street and
###193 stand out from the rest of the people.
###195 And since I had my own kind of tool and materials, people had
###201 to figure that out just to get to where I was.
###204 So it was just being that little bit ahead of the curve.
###207 
###213 So I moved back to New York.
###215 I was living in the Lower East Side, and I met these guys who
###219 opened a store called ALIFE.
###221 They were just like, look, this is really interesting
###223 what you're doing.
###224 We think you could sell it--
###226 we'll help you.
###227 And it became this creative project.
###230 I made some Krink.
###231 We made a logo, we made some labels, put some
###234 directions on it.
###236 Put it in their store and it sold out right away.
###240 So they got press.
###242 They had Krink there, other shops saw that and wanted it.
###246 And then at the same time I would hook up
###248 with the Irak crew.
###252 They were young, I was a little bit older at that time
###255 so I wasn't really going hard.
###257 These guys were really going hard.
###258 And so I'd give them Krink, and they would just be out
###261 every night writing until all of downtown
###265 was basically covered.
###267 And that got a lot of attention because everybody's
###270 like what is that?
###271 What is that?
###272 How are they doing it?
###274 It's Krink.
###275 
###279 I run a business as one part of something that I do.
###285 But I also work on art and design projects.
###288 And it's really difficult sometimes to be doing both,
###292 because mentally they can be really different spaces.
###295 People ask the question.
###297 Like oh, you were in the street, should stay in street.
###301 And who's to say that I'm not allowed to evolve?
###306 And I really love being behind the brand sometimes, because
###310 the brand is more-- it's a brand, it's not really me.
###313 And I kind of like just brand it and market it.
###317 With me sometimes, it's like stuff is emotional, and I kind
###324 of want to have to be able to do whatever the
###327 hell I want to do.
###328 
###331 There's definitely been some great opportunities for public
###337 art projects and travel.
###340 And I think that a lot of people are beginning to try to
###344 organize things themselves.
###347 And I've definitely been involved in things where they
###352 get the community involved, the local community.
###354 And they get business owners to contribute walls.
###358 They fly in artists from all over to paint on walls as part
###364 of greater public art project.
###367 And it's all people who are just really interested in art,
###370 but maybe it's not a formal gallery setting.
###373 It's more interested in the public
###375 space and youth culture.
###378 TIFFANY TANAKA: We are at Loft in Space in Honolulu, Hawaii.
###382 I've been on Queen Street for about the
###384 past eight years now.
###387 Slowly made my way into this warehouse.
###390 We acquired the front, we had a denim store.
###393 And before the denim store we had a streetware store called
###397 Queens, and we carried Krink.
###400 So I was in contact with Krink about five years ago.
###403 And when we were planning these shows, I thought it
###406 would be so cool to bring him here because he's such an
###409 inspiration to so many artists out here.
###412 And the simplicity of what he does is amazing.
###417 But he's the expert in dripping and ink.
###421 
###424 One big thing for both of us, I think , is
###426 art for social change.
###428 And it really affects what's going on, and especially our
###432 economy in Hawaii.
###433 
###436 JASPER WONG: I've lived in Portland and San Francisco and
###438 Japan and Hong Kong.
###440 And she's lived in San Francisco and New York and
###441 Paris and stuff.
###443 And we're exposed to lots of that kind of
###445 artwork and we love it.
###447 We wanted to bring what we saw out there in
###450 those cities to Hawaii.
###452 We knew it was going to be hard.
###454 We knew that there was going to be a huge educational
###455 aspect to it, because it's not as common
###457 here to have art shows.
###459 
###462 How's it coming?
###463 Good?
###464 MALE SPEAKER: Oh, yeah.
###466 CRAIG COSTELLO: I've definitely done some
###468 sculptural pieces, and I'm really interested in working
###472 the sculpture.
###473 And this comes back to like, this is very architectural.
###477 And I'm also do things that are very minimal, and those
###480 things are really interesting to me.
###482 So I think that this shape and this size is really not
###488 foreign to me at all.
###489 I've done a couple of things that have been much smaller.
###494 But I just felt, this space, there was a really good
###496 opportunity, and Jasper and Tiffany were down.
###499 And they're ambitious, and I think this is ambitious.
###503 It's still a small underground space.
###505 We're just trying to make something happen that is going
###508 to be a little different maybe from some of the other things
###511 that they've done.
###512 
###514 I've definitely done a few things like this that are
###518 really buildings, or large walls, interior or exterior,
###524 all painted with fire extinguishers.
###527 I've done all over, from Moscow to Prague--
###531 I've been really fortunate.
###532 
###536 Dry.
###537 The wall is hot.
###538 
###542 You're really dealing with architecture.
###544 You're dealing with the angle of how a wall is seen.
###547 Or maybe it's a rooftop, and you've got to climb to it.
###550 Or maybe it's got a corner, or there's a ledge, and you've
###555 got to stand on a foot-wide ledge to paint the wall.
###559 And you're painting a 10-foot wall by as tall as you can
###562 reach or something.
###563 And all of those things make you consider space really
###566 differently.
###568 And so that was a really big influence
###570 for sure on my process.
###573 I don't write graffiti anymore, but I still see how
###576 it's such a big influence on what I do and how I do it.
###581 In the beginning I had done some stuff with more colors.
###584 But then I just pared it down and just kind of worked within
###588 a smaller palette.
###590 Because it was just easier to make decisions.
###596 I really like yellow and blue, and it was really just the
###599 blending of them making green that became really
###604 interesting.
###605 They're very natural colors-- it's like the sun and the sky.
###608 And it might sound corny, but it's true.
###609 And I think that there's something that people
###611 recognize in that.
###613 With colors, because I've always been in this urban
###616 environment, I can bring a lot to those often drab places.
###621 So this is a cinder block wall.
###623 It's not necessarily architecturally noteworthy,
###628 but I think to bring color to that is part of something that
###633 I'm just interested in doing.
###635 When you do stuff in the public space, basically anyone
###640 can see it.
###641 It's free, and it's available, and people come by.
###645 And there's a reaction, and it's almost always positive.
###650 Oftentimes more people care about just advertising
###653 something, but I think that public art is important.
###656
