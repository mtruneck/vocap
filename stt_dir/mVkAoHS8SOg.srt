3
0:0:13,77 --> 0:0:15,492
RICHARD GARRIOTT: I'm
Richard Garriott.


4
0:0:15,492 --> 0:0:17,43
I'm probably best known
for my work in the


5
0:0:17,43 --> 0:0:18,68
computer game field.


6
0:0:18,68 --> 0:0:26,1



7
0:0:26,1 --> 0:0:28,31
If you go back to the
beginnings, the roots, high


8
0:0:28,31 --> 0:0:32,2
school in the 1970s, which was
right about the same time as


9
0:0:32,2 --> 0:0:35,97
personal computers came into
existence, I was inspired by


10
0:0:35,97 --> 0:0:38,34
the books like The Lord of the
Rings and games like Dungeons


11
0:0:38,34 --> 0:0:43,4
and Dragons to take this new
item, this personal computer,


12
0:0:43,4 --> 0:0:47,34
and started creating fantasy
role playing computer games.


13
0:0:47,34 --> 0:0:50,25
My first character that I began
to play in role playing


14
0:0:50,25 --> 0:0:53,68
games was known as British
because I happened to be born


15
0:0:53,68 --> 0:0:56,575
in Cambridge, England, and some
of my first friends, who


16
0:0:56,575 --> 0:0:58,64
I was playing with, thought for
some reason that I had a


17
0:0:58,64 --> 0:1:0,11
British accent, which
I never did.


18
0:1:0,11 --> 0:1:2,74
I grew up in Houston, so I've
never had a British accent.


19
0:1:2,74 --> 0:1:6,105
It was the owner of a computer
store that saw this game that


20
0:1:6,105 --> 0:1:7,87
I was working on in the
evenings, and said, you know,


21
0:1:7,87 --> 0:1:11,48
Richard, that game is really
much better than the few games


22
0:1:11,48 --> 0:1:13,3
that existed in the day, you
know, here on the store wall.


23
0:1:13,3 --> 0:1:14,63
Why don't we sell it?


24
0:1:14,63 --> 0:1:16,62
And so I went out and spent
what I thought was a huge


25
0:1:16,62 --> 0:1:19,67
amount of money, $200 on ziplock
bags and Xerox cover


26
0:1:19,67 --> 0:1:22,97
sheets, and began to sell
them on the peg board.


27
0:1:22,97 --> 0:1:24,85
One of those found its way
to California, and I was


28
0:1:24,85 --> 0:1:28,66
contacted by one of the first
national distributors.


29
0:1:28,66 --> 0:1:31,44
They distributed about
30,000 copies.


30
0:1:31,44 --> 0:1:33,24
My royalties were $5 a unit.


31
0:1:33,24 --> 0:1:35,52
If you do that math, that's
about $150,000 for a high


32
0:1:35,52 --> 0:1:37,0
school senior.


33
0:1:37,0 --> 0:1:41,12
And they were the ones
who looked at it.


34
0:1:41,12 --> 0:1:43,39
They said, well, you know,
Richard Garriott's a fine


35
0:1:43,39 --> 0:1:44,54
name, it's your name.


36
0:1:44,54 --> 0:1:46,56
But Lord British is much
more memorable.


37
0:1:46,56 --> 0:1:48,99
Why don't we just drop Richard
Garriott, and we'll leave Lord


38
0:1:48,99 --> 0:1:51,61
British on as the author?


39
0:1:51,61 --> 0:1:56,24
I've been Lord British for more
than half my life now, so


40
0:1:56,24 --> 0:2:0,57
I actually feel strangely
comfortable adopting the


41
0:2:0,57 --> 0:2:4,47
persona of Lord British in the
real world, as much as in the


42
0:2:4,47 --> 0:2:7,31
virtual world.


43
0:2:7,31 --> 0:2:10,1
My first published game was
called Akalabeth, which was


44
0:2:10,1 --> 0:2:14,16
really the prequel, effectively,
to the series


45
0:2:14,16 --> 0:2:17,57
that I wrote for 25 years
or more called Ultima.


46
0:2:17,57 --> 0:2:22,64
And published the first Ultima
in about 1981, and in total,


47
0:2:22,64 --> 0:2:26,482
produced nine of the solo
player Ultimas,


48
0:2:26,482 --> 0:2:27,85
plus a few spin offs.


49
0:2:27,85 --> 0:2:43,81



50
0:2:43,81 --> 0:2:47,95
I also produced Ultima Online,
the first of what is now


51
0:2:47,95 --> 0:2:50,54
called a massively multiplayer
online game.


52
0:2:50,54 --> 0:2:53,36
Instead of playing by yourself
on a computer, which is


53
0:2:53,36 --> 0:2:56,7
traditionally the way most
computer games are played, in


54
0:2:56,7 --> 0:2:58,3
this case your computer is
really just a terminal, a


55
0:2:58,3 --> 0:3:1,2
graphics terminal connected
through the internet to a big


56
0:3:1,2 --> 0:3:3,75
central server where everyone
in the world who is playing


57
0:3:3,75 --> 0:3:7,79
the game can see each other,
can play together, either


58
0:3:7,79 --> 0:3:11,67
cooperatively or against each
other, in the same gigantic


59
0:3:11,67 --> 0:3:13,3
virtual world.


60
0:3:13,3 --> 0:3:17,39
So Tabula Rasa is the first
non-Ultima game


61
0:3:17,39 --> 0:3:18,75
I've done in decades.


62
0:3:18,75 --> 0:3:22,9
Instead of fighting medieval
monsters, players use


63
0:3:22,9 --> 0:3:25,42
wormholes to travel through a
variety of planets in space


64
0:3:25,42 --> 0:3:28,39
and fight against the evil alien
hoard that has invaded


65
0:3:28,39 --> 0:3:31,16
the Earth and wiped
out our homeland.


66
0:3:31,16 --> 0:3:35,9
As part of the, what I call
promotional event for the


67
0:3:35,9 --> 0:3:40,18
launch of Tabula Rasa, we tried
to create what you might


68
0:3:40,18 --> 0:3:46,52
call a reality bridge, and try
to prove the truth of some of


69
0:3:46,52 --> 0:3:49,58
what you might call the magical,
or superpower aspects


70
0:3:49,58 --> 0:3:50,37
of Tabula Rasa.


71
0:3:50,37 --> 0:3:53,887
So I hired a whole slew of
magicians who could come in


72
0:3:53,887 --> 0:3:57,72
and do things like spoon
bending, or other kind of--


73
0:3:57,72 --> 0:4:0,24
had mental powers to
physically affect,


74
0:4:0,24 --> 0:4:3,8
telekinetically, the world in
which we lived, to showcase


75
0:4:3,8 --> 0:4:6,7
how here in Austin, here at
my home we actually were


76
0:4:6,7 --> 0:4:9,16
discovering and uncovering
some of these powers that


77
0:4:9,16 --> 0:4:12,51
ultimately would be similar to
what showed up in the game.


78
0:4:12,51 --> 0:4:15,2
We then bussed everybody over
to the property where I'm


79
0:4:15,2 --> 0:4:17,42
building my new home where,
as we were digging the


80
0:4:17,42 --> 0:4:18,7
foundations of the new
home, some of these


81
0:4:18,7 --> 0:4:20,38
artifacts were uncovered.


82
0:4:20,38 --> 0:4:22,7
And then we set up a
big event there.


83
0:4:22,7 --> 0:4:26,18
We had a huge pyrotechnics show
that included not only


84
0:4:26,18 --> 0:4:30,5
lights and sound but also
explosions and gunfire.


85
0:4:30,5 --> 0:4:32,15
But my brother happens to be
a helicopter pilot, so we


86
0:4:32,15 --> 0:4:34,49
actually had him come in and
swoop in with helicopters with


87
0:4:34,49 --> 0:4:39,69
lights and had police cars and
the whole Men in Black kind of


88
0:4:39,69 --> 0:4:42,3
confrontation between the aliens
and the human defenses.


89
0:4:42,3 --> 0:4:45,1



90
0:4:45,1 --> 0:4:49,496
So I'm a big believer in the
quote that I believe Arthur C.


91
0:4:49,496 --> 0:4:52,73
Clarke coined, that any
technology, sufficiently


92
0:4:52,73 --> 0:4:54,6
advanced, is indistinguishable
from magic.


93
0:4:54,6 --> 0:4:57,28
And as you may know, right
beside us, actually, is one of


94
0:4:57,28 --> 0:4:58,81
these devices.


95
0:4:58,81 --> 0:5:1,5
So this is a very
special material


96
0:5:1,5 --> 0:5:2,75
known as ferrous fluid.


97
0:5:2,75 --> 0:5:6,16



98
0:5:6,16 --> 0:5:11,95
And it basically is oil
impregnated with iron filings,


99
0:5:11,95 --> 0:5:12,69
or rust, really.


100
0:5:12,69 --> 0:5:14,92
Iron oxide.


101
0:5:14,92 --> 0:5:17,28
So it's not sharp in a sense of
you can't injure yourself


102
0:5:17,28 --> 0:5:19,61
on it, but it is sharp in the
sense of it is you're coming


103
0:5:19,61 --> 0:5:20,86
up to a perfect point.


104
0:5:20,86 --> 0:5:23,25



105
0:5:23,25 --> 0:5:26,815
In this table, I've built a
collection of electromagnets,


106
0:5:26,815 --> 0:5:29,75
that if you power on these
electromagnets, will create


107
0:5:29,75 --> 0:5:32,47
magnetic fields that will come
up through this oil.


108
0:5:32,47 --> 0:5:37,54
And then this ferrous fluid will
try to form along those


109
0:5:37,54 --> 0:5:39,85
magnetic field lines and create
three-dimensional


110
0:5:39,85 --> 0:5:41,895
shapes rising up out
of a liquid.


111
0:5:41,895 --> 0:5:45,1



112
0:5:45,1 --> 0:5:48,78
I enjoy, you know, exploring the
real world just as much as


113
0:5:48,78 --> 0:5:51,38
I enjoy exploring the
virtual world.


114
0:5:51,38 --> 0:5:54,655
And creatively, I enjoy creating
virtual worlds just


115
0:5:54,655 --> 0:5:56,75
as much as I enjoy creating
physical, practical things,


116
0:5:56,75 --> 0:6:0,21
like unusual homes or other big,
interactive themed events


117
0:6:0,21 --> 0:6:1,24
that are physical.


118
0:6:1,24 --> 0:6:5,37
Virtual exploration is really
only one piece of the puzzle


119
0:6:5,37 --> 0:6:7,46
of the richness of the
tapestry of life.


120
0:6:7,46 --> 0:6:12,84
And so I think it will remain a
very popular portion, but I


121
0:6:12,84 --> 0:6:16,93
don't think there's any chance,
really, of people


122
0:6:16,93 --> 0:6:20,47
tuning out of the real world
and locking in permanently


123
0:6:20,47 --> 0:6:21,72
into their virtual existence.


124
0:6:21,72 --> 0:6:32,84



125
0:6:32,84 --> 0:6:33,64
Welcome to my home.


126
0:6:33,64 --> 0:6:37,46
I actually call this Britannia
Manor, and right as you come


127
0:6:37,46 --> 0:6:41,54
into the interior of my house,
you'll begin to see there's


128
0:6:41,54 --> 0:6:43,56
already some unusual features.


129
0:6:43,56 --> 0:6:45,49
Swords and crossbows here.


130
0:6:45,49 --> 0:6:48,4
We then built this steel
structure, upon which is


131
0:6:48,4 --> 0:6:49,71
mounted the telescope that's
in my observatory.


132
0:6:49,71 --> 0:6:54,21



133
0:6:54,21 --> 0:6:56,7
This is actually the highest
point in the


134
0:6:56,7 --> 0:6:57,17
entire city of Austin.


135
0:6:57,17 --> 0:6:59,6
I actually got a topographical
map out, and that's how I


136
0:6:59,6 --> 0:7:1,99
selected this property.


137
0:7:1,99 --> 0:7:4,28
That's how I selected this
property, was actually to


138
0:7:4,28 --> 0:7:7,527
identify the best place to put a
telescope to get a nice, 360


139
0:7:7,527 --> 0:7:10,8
degree view of the horizon,
which we get up here in the


140
0:7:10,8 --> 0:7:11,97
observatory dome.


141
0:7:11,97 --> 0:7:14,94
The homes I build are very much
manifestations of the


142
0:7:14,94 --> 0:7:18,86
same creative drive that you see
that goes into the games


143
0:7:18,86 --> 0:7:21,33
and other events
that I produce.


144
0:7:21,33 --> 0:7:24,155
They function as a normal house,
but they're also big,


145
0:7:24,155 --> 0:7:26,15
what you might call personal
playscapes.


146
0:7:26,15 --> 0:7:30,6
So they're filled with secret
passageways throughout, and an


147
0:7:30,6 --> 0:7:34,5
observatory, and dungeons,
indoor, outdoor pools, and


148
0:7:34,5 --> 0:7:35,39
artificial rain.


149
0:7:35,39 --> 0:7:38,69
And then of course all my
collections of collections.


150
0:7:38,69 --> 0:7:41,0
It's a habit I picked up my
mother, actually, I think, is


151
0:7:41,0 --> 0:7:45,11
to be this level of pack
rat, you might say.


152
0:7:45,11 --> 0:7:49,74
This is my home office, where
I keep a lot of my recent


153
0:7:49,74 --> 0:7:54,82
artifacts from my space trip,
including, these are some of


154
0:7:54,82 --> 0:7:59,33
the items I took with me
to space and back.


155
0:7:59,33 --> 0:8:2,6
So now we'll go down to what I
happen to call the medieval


156
0:8:2,6 --> 0:8:4,36
portion of the house.


157
0:8:4,36 --> 0:8:7,28
And I've got some nice astronomy
prints, and you'll


158
0:8:7,28 --> 0:8:10,79
also begin to see some of
the more unusual bits


159
0:8:10,79 --> 0:8:12,4
of art in the house.


160
0:8:12,4 --> 0:8:15,63
These are actually preserved
octopus tentacles that are


161
0:8:15,63 --> 0:8:18,5
here in these containers.


162
0:8:18,5 --> 0:8:22,2
And then in here, in the upper
floor of what you might call


163
0:8:22,2 --> 0:8:24,7
the study, a collection from
my childhood, so to speak.


164
0:8:24,7 --> 0:8:26,8
I'm obviously a big fan of
The Lord of the Rings.


165
0:8:26,8 --> 0:8:29,72
I've got not only first
editions but--


166
0:8:29,72 --> 0:8:30,96
those are first editions--


167
0:8:30,96 --> 0:8:32,6
these are pre-first-editions.


168
0:8:32,6 --> 0:8:33,72
Pre-publication editions.


169
0:8:33,72 --> 0:8:35,179
Proof copies.


170
0:8:35,179 --> 0:8:38,73
So here on the upper floor of
the study, one of the common


171
0:8:38,73 --> 0:8:41,24
questions is, how do
we get downstairs?


172
0:8:41,24 --> 0:8:44,52
Because of course, there is no
obvious route between the two.


173
0:8:44,52 --> 0:8:46,99
There's no staircases
or doorways.


174
0:8:46,99 --> 0:8:50,78
And the solution to that
involves this surface.


175
0:8:50,78 --> 0:8:55,87
And in this surface, I've
inserted 18 magnetic sensors.


176
0:8:55,87 --> 0:8:58,35
In fact, there's a drop panel
on this side with nine, and


177
0:8:58,35 --> 0:8:59,63
there's actually nine
more that I don't


178
0:8:59,63 --> 0:9:1,95
generally use on this side.


179
0:9:1,95 --> 0:9:4,84
And in this kind of eyeballs and
teeth thing that my mother


180
0:9:4,84 --> 0:9:8,22
made for me, I've inserted
magnets up inside of it.


181
0:9:8,22 --> 0:9:11,61
And so now if you move this
device in the right pattern


182
0:9:11,61 --> 0:9:17,24
over those magnetic sensors,
that little click has


183
0:9:17,24 --> 0:9:21,2
unlatched a magnetic latch that
lets us into this secret


184
0:9:21,2 --> 0:9:22,47
passageway.


185
0:9:22,47 --> 0:9:25,37
We can go down this spiral
staircase here to the lower


186
0:9:25,37 --> 0:9:27,46
floor of the study
to the dungeon.


187
0:9:27,46 --> 0:9:31,13
And the dungeon, of course, is
the room full of dead things.


188
0:9:31,13 --> 0:9:34,47
Some recently, some long
dead, as well as a


189
0:9:34,47 --> 0:9:37,64
few pieces of art.


190
0:9:37,64 --> 0:9:39,6
This is a velociraptor skeleton


191
0:9:39,6 --> 0:9:40,49
that's actually a cast.


192
0:9:40,49 --> 0:9:42,48
And this is also
a piece of art.


193
0:9:42,48 --> 0:9:46,1
But most of the other things in
here are real, including my


194
0:9:46,1 --> 0:9:47,75
dead friend that I call Pedro.


195
0:9:47,75 --> 0:9:51,18
This is the skull of an
African elephant.


196
0:9:51,18 --> 0:9:54,36
Across here on the side of the
room, these are authentic


197
0:9:54,36 --> 0:9:57,6
South American shrunken heads.


198
0:9:57,6 --> 0:10:0,84
I have a number of vampire
hunting kits.


199
0:10:0,84 --> 0:10:3,91
Everything from, like, a human
fetus that I have here in this


200
0:10:3,91 --> 0:10:6,1
jar to a human heart.


201
0:10:6,1 --> 0:10:9,42
These are Borneo headhunter
human trophy skulls and the


202
0:10:9,42 --> 0:10:12,62
skills of everything from
African lions and prehistoric


203
0:10:12,62 --> 0:10:15,58
cave bears, creatures
and critters


204
0:10:15,58 --> 0:10:17,89
from around the globe.


205
0:10:17,89 --> 0:10:21,9
In the living room, of course,
we have the normal things--


206
0:10:21,9 --> 0:10:23,92
couches, chairs, stereos
and TVs--


207
0:10:23,92 --> 0:10:25,93
but we also have something
unusual in my house, which, of


208
0:10:25,93 --> 0:10:28,51
course, is the continuation of
the secret passageway network.


209
0:10:28,51 --> 0:10:31,5
And so if I reach in this drawer
and reach up into the


210
0:10:31,5 --> 0:10:33,23
ceiling, I'm actually pulling
a little latch.


211
0:10:33,23 --> 0:10:35,55
And then if you come over here,
and you look at this


212
0:10:35,55 --> 0:10:38,3
innocent looking mirror,
this is really a


213
0:10:38,3 --> 0:10:41,3
secret passageway entrance.


214
0:10:41,3 --> 0:10:45,48
This is actually one of two
Sputniks that I own.


215
0:10:45,48 --> 0:10:47,1
So this is the first
one that I own.


216
0:10:47,1 --> 0:10:49,48
And the other one's up in the
automaton room that I'll take


217
0:10:49,48 --> 0:10:51,6
you to momentarily.


218
0:10:51,6 --> 0:10:56,106
I'm sure that this is the
largest collection of


219
0:10:56,106 --> 0:10:57,414
contemporary automatons.


220
0:10:57,414 --> 0:11:24,11



221
0:11:24,11 --> 0:11:27,66
But physically assembled to
create something really


222
0:11:27,66 --> 0:11:29,39
masterful, artistically.


223
0:11:29,39 --> 0:11:32,65
And so I find these to be a
good, what I call, physical


224
0:11:32,65 --> 0:11:34,33
analogy to what we do.


225
0:11:34,33 --> 0:11:51,84



226
0:11:51,84 --> 0:11:54,85
Naturalist catching butterflies,
with an alien


227
0:11:54,85 --> 0:11:54,79
catching him.


228
0:11:54,79 --> 0:11:57,745
This one actually requires
looking in this little hole.


229
0:11:57,745 --> 0:12:6,7



230
0:12:6,7 --> 0:12:7,65
So this one is the American
execution.


231
0:12:7,65 --> 0:12:9,36
We electrocute our victims.


232
0:12:9,36 --> 0:12:11,93
And so here is this guy
being prepared for


233
0:12:11,93 --> 0:12:13,715
the electric chair.


234
0:12:13,715 --> 0:12:15,15
The doctors are checking
him out.


235
0:12:15,15 --> 0:12:18,55
They're checking the voltages
of the machine.


236
0:12:18,55 --> 0:12:20,73



237
0:12:20,73 --> 0:12:22,29
They lower it down, the
thing on his head.


238
0:12:22,29 --> 0:12:25,854
Turning, glowing red while
he's being electrocuted.


239
0:12:25,854 --> 0:12:30,3
And he's killed.


240
0:12:30,3 --> 0:12:32,97
He's playing music only the dead
can hear, so that's why


241
0:12:32,97 --> 0:12:34,22
you can't hear it.


242
0:12:34,22 --> 0:12:45,15



243
0:12:45,15 --> 0:12:49,34
And even outside, there's fun
things, like I've got a pond


244
0:12:49,34 --> 0:12:53,39
with a bridge and little cabanas
and things out on it.


245
0:12:53,39 --> 0:12:56,16
I've got a three-horse carousel
that operates out in


246
0:12:56,16 --> 0:12:57,41
the front yard.


247
0:12:57,41 --> 0:13:15,7



248
0:13:15,7 --> 0:13:18,11
Literally, throughout my entire
professional career,


249
0:13:18,11 --> 0:13:20,48
I've been investing in the
privatization of space,


250
0:13:20,48 --> 0:13:24,83
helping to unlock the gates
of private space travel.


251
0:13:24,83 --> 0:13:34,99



252
0:13:34,99 --> 0:13:37,9
I fancy myself a gentleman
explorer, you might say.


253
0:13:37,9 --> 0:13:41,83
On October 12, I
launched to the


254
0:13:41,83 --> 0:13:43,7
International Space Station.


255
0:13:43,7 --> 0:13:47,59
And I went there on board a
Russian Soyuz rocket, actually


256
0:13:47,59 --> 0:13:49,52
called a Soyuz TMA 13.


257
0:13:49,52 --> 0:13:53,4
You know, that's a pretty
spectacular


258
0:13:53,4 --> 0:13:54,39
day, you might say.


259
0:13:54,39 --> 0:13:56,89
I'd already spent about nine
months in Russia, training.


260
0:13:56,89 --> 0:14:6,47



261
0:14:6,47 --> 0:14:8,54
In the long-term future of the
Earth, there's no question


262
0:14:8,54 --> 0:14:11,76
that something apocalyptic
will occur.


263
0:14:11,76 --> 0:14:15,3
We someday will probably be
struck by an asteroid that


264
0:14:15,3 --> 0:14:16,66
will destroy most of life on
the Earth, it's only a


265
0:14:16,66 --> 0:14:18,58
question of when.


266
0:14:18,58 --> 0:14:21,68
We may unleash nuclear
holocaust.


267
0:14:21,68 --> 0:14:22,77
Maybe.


268
0:14:22,77 --> 0:14:24,98
That seems unlikely today, but
we've been through cycles


269
0:14:24,98 --> 0:14:28,13
where it seems more likely,
so it might happen again.


270
0:14:28,13 --> 0:14:33,2
You know, biological problems
that are pandemics that could


271
0:14:33,2 --> 0:14:35,62
come up, I think are also
a practical risk.


272
0:14:35,62 --> 0:14:39,49
And so if you add all that up,
one of the best ways for


273
0:14:39,49 --> 0:14:41,96
humanity to ensure that we
survive into the future is to


274
0:14:41,96 --> 0:14:46,57
make sure we have isolated
settlements around the


275
0:14:46,57 --> 0:14:48,97
universe, in which case an
apocalypse on one won't wipe


276
0:14:48,97 --> 0:14:50,8
out the whole species.


277
0:14:50,8 --> 0:14:52,59
I very much agree with that,
that that's one very


278
0:14:52,59 --> 0:14:55,91
compelling reason that humanity
really does need to


279
0:14:55,91 --> 0:14:58,8
spread beyond the surface
of the Earth.


280
0:14:58,8 --> 0:15:1,5
The only debate in my mind is
how urgently should you feel


281
0:15:1,5 --> 0:15:2,4
that that's necessary.


282
0:15:2,4 --> 0:15:4,85
And I personally believe there's
no time like the


283
0:15:4,85 --> 0:15:6,45
present, so let's get to work.


284
0:15:6,45 --> 0:15:10,77



285
0:15:10,77 --> 0:15:13,73
Walking up to a fully fueled
rocket, which has kerosene and


286
0:15:13,73 --> 0:15:18,42
liquid oxygen, so it's frozen
to well below freezing.


287
0:15:18,42 --> 0:15:21,93
So the whole vehicle is covered
with frost, and any


288
0:15:21,93 --> 0:15:25,65
air coming near it is turning
into fog, and streaming down


289
0:15:25,65 --> 0:15:27,446
the sides of this rocket.


290
0:15:27,446 --> 0:15:31,25
You know, you squeeze yourself
in, and on a Soyuz, you


291
0:15:31,25 --> 0:15:34,45
literally squeeze yourself in
through the hatches and get


292
0:15:34,45 --> 0:15:35,25
down into your seat.


293
0:15:35,25 --> 0:15:40,88
And one of my jobs is to push
the button that starts up the


294
0:15:40,88 --> 0:15:43,67
operation of the vehicle.


295
0:15:43,67 --> 0:15:47,82
Then when the countdown reaches
zero, the thing lights


296
0:15:47,82 --> 0:15:50,47
up, and it's funny--


297
0:15:50,47 --> 0:15:53,2
it's a relatively gentle
ride into space.


298
0:15:53,2 --> 0:15:58,21
The g-forces start very
minimal but slowly and


299
0:15:58,21 --> 0:16:0,87
steadily increase to about
4 and 1/2 g's.


300
0:16:0,87 --> 0:16:4,41
And after about eight minutes at
4 and 1/2 g's, the engines


301
0:16:4,41 --> 0:16:5,66
cut off, and you're in space.


302
0:16:5,66 --> 0:16:8,58



303
0:16:8,58 --> 0:16:10,325
Before I flew--


304
0:16:10,325 --> 0:16:12,9
you know, you always hear about
things that people have


305
0:16:12,9 --> 0:16:14,69
said, like once you go to space
and you see the Earth


306
0:16:14,69 --> 0:16:17,92
from such a distance, and you
see the world without the


307
0:16:17,92 --> 0:16:19,82
boundaries between countries
and things, how it changes


308
0:16:19,82 --> 0:16:24,31
your perception of life and
humanity's place on Earth.


309
0:16:24,31 --> 0:16:27,4
It's pretty amazing to look out
at the edge of the Earth


310
0:16:27,4 --> 0:16:31,4
and see the thin veil of the
atmosphere clinging to the


311
0:16:31,4 --> 0:16:33,52
very round Earth you
can see from space.


312
0:16:33,52 --> 0:16:35,945
And so you feel, still, very
intimate with the surface of


313
0:16:35,945 --> 0:16:38,24
the Earth in ways that
I found unexpected.


314
0:16:38,24 --> 0:16:41,85
The next thing you begin to
notice is how every fertile


315
0:16:41,85 --> 0:16:45,18
place on the Earth that you
travel over is now fully


316
0:16:45,18 --> 0:16:46,86
occupied by people.


317
0:16:46,86 --> 0:16:49,5
There is no place that you
might describe as easy to


318
0:16:49,5 --> 0:16:51,68
occupy that isn't already
occupied.


319
0:16:51,68 --> 0:16:54,53
While there was no one moment
where I'd say a-ha, I've had


320
0:16:54,53 --> 0:16:57,94
an epiphany, I now have a
changed perception of humanity


321
0:16:57,94 --> 0:16:59,52
and Earth, it really
is something that


322
0:16:59,52 --> 0:17:1,11
builds on you over time.


323
0:17:1,11 --> 0:17:2,19
It really is truly there.


324
0:17:2,19 --> 0:17:5,5
So upon my return, I can
definitely now reflect on it


325
0:17:5,5 --> 0:17:9,693
and say that absolutely, I
believe that my perception of


326
0:17:9,693 --> 0:17:13,81
what I call the fragility of
the Earth and the human


327
0:17:13,81 --> 0:17:16,27
footprint on the Earth is
absolutely changed.


328
0:17:16,27 --> 0:17:18,93



329
0:17:18,93 --> 0:17:23,99
My father is an astronaut, so I
grew up in a household where


330
0:17:23,99 --> 0:17:25,52
space felt very normal.


331
0:17:25,52 --> 0:17:28,6
And in fact, not only was my
father an astronaut, but my


332
0:17:28,6 --> 0:17:30,91
right-hand next door neighbor
was a guy named Joe Engle,


333
0:17:30,91 --> 0:17:32,0
another astronaut.


334
0:17:32,0 --> 0:17:34,1
My left-hand next door neighbor
was Hoot Gibson,


335
0:17:34,1 --> 0:17:34,97
another astronaut.


336
0:17:34,97 --> 0:17:37,24
Everyone in my neighborhood was
involved in some way in


337
0:17:37,24 --> 0:17:38,5
putting people into space.


338
0:17:38,5 --> 0:17:39,6
And so I kind of grew
up believing


339
0:17:39,6 --> 0:17:40,65
everybody would go to space.


340
0:17:40,65 --> 0:17:43,23
And when I was a young teenager,
I was actually at


341
0:17:43,23 --> 0:17:47,76
NASA one time, and one of the
NASA flight physicians was


342
0:17:47,76 --> 0:17:48,68
giving me an eye test.


343
0:17:48,68 --> 0:17:52,4
And my eyesight was fairly
poor when I was young.


344
0:17:52,4 --> 0:17:54,18
And they said, oh, you know, I'm
so sorry, Richard, but you


345
0:17:54,18 --> 0:17:55,69
know, your poor eyesight's gonna
prevent you from ever


346
0:17:55,69 --> 0:17:57,93
being selected as a
NASA astronaut.


347
0:17:57,93 --> 0:17:59,88
And for me, that was like being
told, hey, by the way,


348
0:17:59,88 --> 0:18:2,685
you are no longer eligible for
the club that everyone you


349
0:18:2,685 --> 0:18:3,84
know is a member of.


350
0:18:3,84 --> 0:18:5,85
Prior to that moment, I don't
think I was particularly


351
0:18:5,85 --> 0:18:8,57
devoted to getting my way
into space until I was


352
0:18:8,57 --> 0:18:9,82
told, you can't go.


353
0:18:9,82 --> 0:18:15,2



354
0:18:15,2 --> 0:18:19,65
I spent two days living onboard
the Soyuz while we


355
0:18:19,65 --> 0:18:22,23
were catching up to and
matching orbits to


356
0:18:22,23 --> 0:18:23,93
dock with the ISS.


357
0:18:23,93 --> 0:18:28,5
I then spent 10 days onboard
the space station, doing a


358
0:18:28,5 --> 0:18:29,3
wide variety of experiments.


359
0:18:29,3 --> 0:18:38,52



360
0:18:38,52 --> 0:18:41,39
Uh, yeah, I would definitely say
that this has met and, in


361
0:18:41,39 --> 0:18:43,14
many ways, exceeded
my expectations.


362
0:18:43,14 --> 0:18:44,98
There's no question that I've
already begun to think about


363
0:18:44,98 --> 0:18:46,37
the next trip up.


364
0:18:46,37 --> 0:18:48,27
MALE SPEAKER: How have your
found your zero-g


365
0:18:48,27 --> 0:18:49,94
artwork to be going?


366
0:18:49,94 --> 0:18:52,49
RICHARD GARRIOTT: Well, I did
create the zero-g artwork.


367
0:18:52,49 --> 0:18:56,89
I came up with a glove box in
which I could release my paint


368
0:18:56,89 --> 0:19:0,1
without risking painting the
walls of the station, and


369
0:19:0,1 --> 0:19:1,8
created some art that I'll be
bringing back, so you can


370
0:19:1,8 --> 0:19:2,88
judge for yourself.


371
0:19:2,88 --> 0:19:5,51
With this trip, I was trying
to study and analyze how


372
0:19:5,51 --> 0:19:10,77
private citizens might be able
to contribute to the success


373
0:19:10,77 --> 0:19:11,72
here in space.


374
0:19:11,72 --> 0:19:12,9
And I'll have a lot more
thoughts for that


375
0:19:12,9 --> 0:19:13,75
when I come back down.


376
0:19:13,75 --> 0:19:15,21
Thanks.


377
0:19:15,21 --> 0:19:17,21
Station this is KSC PAO.


378
0:19:17,21 --> 0:19:18,79
That's the final question
here from Florida.


379
0:19:18,79 --> 0:19:20,88
We're now going to toss you
briefly back to Houston.


380
0:19:20,88 --> 0:21:20,88
