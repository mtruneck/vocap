###5 THOMAS: Hi, I'm Thomas Morton.
###6 We're here in the sewer system of Bogota, Colombia, a place
###10 where for the past 30 years, the city's kind of lower-rung
###15 street kids have sought refuge from the right wing death
###18 squads, which fairly regularly patrol the city above.
###22 In the late '80s, kind of the height of the epidemic of
###24 street kids here, small business owners and kind of
###28 the wealthy elite started raising death squads to help
###31 rid their property of what they thought as disposables, a
###37 process which they kind of cheerfully
###39 called social cleansing.
###40 One of the only people in Colombia to help the sewer
###43 children, Dr. Jaime Jaramillo, has pulled thousands of kids
###46 out of the pipes.
###47 But at the same time, a lot of them still remain.
###50 We asked Dr. Jaramillo to take us down here and show us how
###52 the kids live in some cases and what's in store for the
###56 refugees on their way in.
###57 
###60 This is the same tube that 15 years ago our friend
###66 Alberto lived in.
###68 We're going to go sit down and talk with Alberto about having
###70 lived in the sewers and about how he's been since.
###73 God, not having light down there.
###76 Just the prospect of that makes me shudder.
###81 
###86 ALBERTO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###87 
###137 THOMAS: We're getting suited up.
###138 We got these fishing waders.
###141 This almost seems like it might
###143 even be a little excessive.
###144 But I guess, considering what we're about to do, better safe
###149 than coming down with cholera or something.
###154 Dr. Jaime is going to give me acupuncture now to help my
###157 immune system.
###158 I hate needles.
###159 So I'm concerned about this.
###161 
###171 It's treacherous even getting down here.
###173 Did you see the rat?
###174 Yeah, I just saw that rat scurry up there.
###177 So this is it.
###178 This is bottom of the barrel as far as Western
###182 civilization goes.
###184 A cave would almost be a step up because it wouldn't be
###188 filled with shit.
###189 And you wouldn't be worried about swimming in filth.
###191 It's appalling.
###193 
###199 THOMAS: [INAUDIBLE].
###201 There's all these burnt-up bottles used as pipes.
###204 
###208 This is all their stuff.
###210 This is where they smoke--
###211 DR. JARAMILLO: Basuco.
###212 THOMAS: --basuco.
###213 DR. JARAMILLO: This is crack cocaine.
###214 THOMAS: OK, I'm going to keep going further in.
###219 
###222 You can see all the fucking gnats and flies.
###224 
###227 At this point, I'm pretty fucking scared.
###231 
###241 THOMAS: [GASPS].
###242 You can get a fresh waft of the smell.
###245 This is, like, shit stalactites, shit-sicles.
###248 
###261 They're smoking out of bent-up cans.
###264 They're right behind us.
###264 They don't want to be filmed, though, because they're
###266 worried about the police finding out where they are.
###269 They're sitting on, like, the little table.
###271 
###282 DR. JARAMILLO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###284 
###288 THOMAS: We caught them right when they were
###290 about to smoke up.
###291 So they're a little jumpy and obviously
###295 didn't want to be filmed.
###296 Because they're afraid that if this gets out, then the police
###300 will know where they are.
###300 And they'll come and they'll beat the shit out of them.
###302 
###308 That's fresh shit.
###309 
###316 THOMAS: There's the manhole.
###319 THOMAS: Ninja Turtles had a nicer setup than this.
###325 So all his stuff, he just stays here?
###328 THOMAS: Oh, OK.
###330 That's his little drug kit.
###331 That's where he sleeps.
###333 
###337 THOMAS: Is it?
###337 No, it's moist.
###338 DR. JARAMILLO: Look.
###340 THOMAS: So how long have you been coming into the sewers?
###342 You told us yesterday you got started
###344 helping kids in the '70s.
###378 [SHRIEKING SOUND]
###379 DR. JARAMILLO: Could somebody else.
###381 THOMAS: What was that?
###383 Was that a siren?
###385 
###397 DR. JARAMILLO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###398 
###401 THOMAS: Well, we should go, though.
###404 DR. JARAMILLO: They [INAUDIBLE].
###405 They use [INAUDIBLE] rocks, crack cocaine.
###412 And their survival depends on how high the--
###417 THOMAS: The water is.
###417 DR. JARAMILLO: --their head, above the human waste.
###419 ALBERTO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###421 
###493 DR. JARAMILLO: All the canals--
###495 THOMAS: They're all connected, right?
###496 DR. JARAMILLO: You may not know that they
###497 are watching you.
###498 But they are watching you all the time.
###500 THOMAS: Like we're almost on the edge of the suburbs.
###502 We're on some kind of highway right now.
###503 There's some apartment buildings right there and a
###505 couple gas stations.
###506 But that's basically it.
###509 Where exactly this canal runs, they're all kind
###511 of coming up it.
###512 They're just kind of collecting right now.
###514 
###518 It's the same thing that happens out in the countryside
###520 with the paramilitaries.
###522 What it is, is landowners get upset about liberal agitation,
###525 socialists, and stuff like.
###526 And so they get together.
###527 And they organize these little militias, and say, go out and
###531 take care of this for us.
###533 When we got here, the guards over there on the first tier
###537 of those high rises, they started flashing their lights
###539 down at us and on the dudes walking around down there.
###543 So that's what they've got to worry about.
###546 Maybe one of them will chat with us.
###550 That's about as dead as a rat can get.
###552 
###554 How often do you have trouble with the police?
###557 ROBERTO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###558 
###573 THOMAS: Ow.
###574 That's terrible.
###576 Do you have run-ins with paramilitaries?
###578 ROBERTO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###579 
###582 THOMAS: When?
###583 
###586 ROBERTO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###587 
###592 THOMAS: So they're trying to jump the stream to keep their
###597 feet from soaking.
###598 
###601 That was pretty good.
###602 
###617 Oh, here come biker cops.
###620 Man, I feel like I'm in middle school again.
###623 [MOTORCYCLE MOTOR REVVING]
###623 THOMAS: Yeah, we're cool.
###626 Do you want to hang the camera?
###628 
###631 Oh, here's the police.
###633 I went from scared as shit to enjoying our fiesta to back to
###639 scared as shit.
###639 Because here are the cops.
###641 Any time it stops being intense, something happens.
###644 POLICE OFFICER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###645 
###656 THOMAS: I think we may have fucked up their
###659 spot for the night.
###661 Everybody's leaving now.
###662 Roberto told us that they're due for a cleansing.
###665 ROBERTO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###666 
###693 THOMAS: Here's a little bit of heaviness, 15 years ago in
###696 this manhole there were a rotating group
###699 of kids living there.
###700 One night, death squads came over, popped open the lid, and
###704 poured gasoline onto them.
###706 And just set the whole thing a-fucking-blaze.
###709 It burned, like, 22 kids.
###724 The ground's a little more dry than the other places.
###727 
###734 Were you on the streets when they gasolined the manhole by
###739 the elevator?
###740 PABLO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###742 
###756 THOMAS: There was a place that foiled, like that the police
###758 couldn't get into with their guns.
###761 So they just burned everybody.
###763 PABLO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###764 
###791 THOMAS: They just left the burning kids there?
###792 They didn't even remove their bodies?
###796 The entire escape tunnel is filled with water.
###798 You can it's already dripping down over here.
###801 What happens when it rains?
###802 PABLO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###804 
###810 THOMAS: Do you know people who have drowned?
###812 Have friends of yours drowned?
###813 [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###814 
###920 THOMAS: Jesus.
###921 PABLO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###922 
###927 THOMAS: Is that the last time you were harassed here?
###930 Or have they harassed you since?
###932 [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###934 
###939 TRANSLATOR: They usually pick Sundays, such as today.
###944 THOMAS: This is like one of those ghost stories, where
###947 they're like, and it was 30 years ago tonight in
###950 this very camp spot.
###952 And then they describe exactly what you're wearing as what
###955 the killer liked.
###956 
###961 So we're fucking stepping off into the abyss here.
###964 It's starting to get really slippery.
###966 
###970 The smell, I feel like it gets exponentially
###973 worse with every step.
###975 Right now we're at, like, county fair port-a-john.
###980 I mean, this is just shit.
###980 DR. JARAMILLO: This is human waste, a rat.
###983 THOMAS: Probably shouldn't be touching the wall.
###984 
###987 This right here, this keeps going.
###989 How long has it been since it rained?
###990 DR. JARAMILLO: A month ago.
###992 THOMAS: It was a month.
###993 And it's like we're shin deep.
###998 Were there people in here?
###999 DR. JARAMILLO: Yeah.
###1000 THOMAS: How many?
###1002 DR. JARAMILLO: [INAUDIBLE] like 20.
###1003 But the other side.
###1005 THOMAS: How far?
###1006 DR. JARAMILLO: Like 10 minutes.
###1009 THOMAS: So we're right at the point where
###1011 it's no longer safe.
###1012 DR. JARAMILLO: And it's not good to stay very long here.
###1016 THOMAS: People could come.
###1017 I can't see.
###1018 Can you kill the light for a second?
###1022 Because nobody comes here with flashlights.
###1024 
###1031 Jesus Christ!
###1032 
###1035 I can barely--
###1038 I just want to see how long before
###1040 my mind starts swimming.
###1044 ALBERTO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1045 
###1054 THOMAS: You can kind of see a little bit of light there.
###1056 And a little bit of light there.
###1058 ALBERTO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1059 
###1068 THOMAS: I'm see shadows move.
###1069 I feel like shit is crawling up inside me.
###1072 I don't know if maybe there's a rat chewing on me.
###1075 FEMALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1076 
###1082 THOMAS: It's like submitting yourself to madness.
###1085 
###1089 OK, let's get the lights back on.
###1090 I'm fucked.
###1092 That did it.
###1094 That did it for me.
###1096 Lights, please.
###1096 Thank you.
###1097 Holy shit.
###1098 FEMALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1099 
###1138 THOMAS: We ran into this guy who lives here in what he
###1141 calls his penthouse by the sea whose wife is also pregnant.
###1146 JOSE: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1151 THOMAS: By far the most luxurious place.
###1153 I had to wedge myself up through a little
###1156 hole to get in here.
###1159 It's really spacious and safe feeling.
###1162 But you have to watch out so you don't cut
###1165 your head on the pipes.
###1167 How long have you been in this place?
###1169 JOSE: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1170 
###1172 THOMAS: Your wife is expecting?
###1176 JOSE: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1177 
###1179 THOMAS: When the baby is due, will you go to the hospital?
###1182 Or will you--
###1183 LADY: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1185 
###1189 THOMAS: Do you cook your food in here?
###1190 JOSE: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1192 
###1204 THOMAS: It's gotten bigger back here.
###1207 You can stand up all the way.
###1208 JOSE: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1210 
###1222 THOMAS: Has anybody ever found you here?
###1223 Has anybody ever bugged you?
###1225 JOSE: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1227 
###1234 THOMAS: Is there food in here?
###1235 JOSE: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1236 
###1248 THOMAS: Here's the bedroom.
###1248 This is a pretty sweet setup.
###1253 [LAUGHTER]
###1256 JOSE: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1258 
###1260 THOMAS: The other puppies.
###1262 JOSE: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1263 
###1272 THOMAS: Ah, here's the fire pit.
###1274 JOSE: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1275 
###1291 THOMAS: This is the whole stash right here
###1293 waiting to be recycled.
###1294 
###1298 [SPANISH].
###1300 JOSE: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1302 THOMAS: Are you OK with all the bedroom decorations?
###1306 [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1308 
###1316 THOMAS: Do you have any plans for new additions?
###1319 LADY: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1320 THOMAS: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1323 LADY: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1327 JOSE: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1328 
###1332 THOMAS: What kind of rate would you charge?
###1333 JOSE: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1334 
###1341 THOMAS: Sold.
###1342 JOSE: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1344 [LAUGHTER]
###1347 THOMAS: I've got nothing to say.
###1348 This place is great.
###1349 If I've got to move in somewhere in the sewer systems
###1352 of Bogota, this is going to be it.
###1354 [LAUGHTER]
###1355 THOMAS: And pretty reasonable rent.
###1357 And I like the landlord.
###1359 LADY: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1361 THOMAS: Si.
###1362 Gracias.
###1362 LADY: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1363 THOMAS: Mucho gusto.
###1365 JOSE: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1366 
###1392 THOMAS: Gracias.
###1393 Coming down.
###1395 The entry's a bit rough.
###1396 But once you're inside--
###1398 
###1401 ALBERTO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1403 
###1428 THOMAS: I'm in the middle of a tube that Alberto
###1430 used to live in.
###1433 What's up?
###1433 What's going on?
###1434 What's going on out there?
###1436 Do you hear that?
###1438 Car just stopped right there.
###1440 
###1443 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1445 THOMAS: Do you hear that?
###1446 
###1450 So we should turn the light off now.
###1453 OK, we're getting out of here now.
###1455 Last night we were in the sewers.
###1457 Our night ended with the arrival of a death squad.
###1460 After they left, we fucking jetted out of there.
###1463 They parked a little bit up the sewers.
###1466 And we had to go and hide.
###1467 There was about 10 or 15 guys.
###1469 Some of them were in police uniform.
###1470 Some of them were in military.
###1471 And some of them were in just civilian clothes.
###1475 The ones we could see kind of from where we were, our
###1477 vantage point, were armed to the fucking teeth.
###1479 They all had fucking machine guns, packing pistols, too.
###1482 We're in the car right now on the way to the airport.
###1484 Five minutes ago, Jaime called us.
###1487 And last night, three sewers were gasolined and burnt.
###1491 So it's funny to say, considering the kind of shit
###1498 we've seen while we were down here, that we've gotten the
###1501 absolute best of it.
###1503 We've had the best of luck and not run into any trouble.
###1507 And even so, we've run into cops.
###1509 We've run into a death squad.
###1510 We've been knee-high in fucking shit.
###1514 
###1517 And that's the best the sewers have to ofter to anybody.
###1521 And we're on our way out right now.
###1523 We're heading back to our cushy fucking apartments in
###1526 the United States.
###1526 And these people have to sit here and live
###1529 with this every day.
###1531 It's fucked.
###1532
