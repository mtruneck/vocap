###0 so is rather to full immigration from these is first of all those refugees are
###4 from sudan and that are in the country and there's been
###7 a lot of uh... education over that
###11 you know israelis
###12 protest saying marching
###14 sometimes yelling at sudanese women
###18 and men and calling them a lot of matter words
###22 uh... basically say sydney's go home you not welcome here your criminals in one
###27 instance shouting at them your force and saturn
###30 now of courses are irony there israel was created
###33 because nobody would take in the jews during the holocaust
###37 that seems like an excellent justification and the one that is used
###41 most often understandably so
###44 now the sudanese
###46 have not been treated well not just in sudan the ones that are fleeing
###49 but also in inject and other muslim countries as well
###52 golombek christian an airplane because they're being persecuted because of
###56 religious reasons
###58 now you would hope that
###60 of all the countries in the world israel would understand that that's
###63 but that's actually the least of their immigration problems
###66 they also have the hundred and thirty thousand easy opiates now in this case
###69 they've europeans are george so it does really matters and jewish state so that
###73 they should be welcome right
###75 well not exactly
###77 their health ministry has just admitted
###80 that they were doing forced sterilization
###82 of ethiopian women even though there george
###85 as they were coming into the country
###87 now thank of association is not permanent
###90 but he did last for a long time in front of the last ten years
###93 the birth rate among ethiopians in israel has dropped
###97 fifty percent
###100 you know not to speculate as to why as i just told you
###103 israel's health minister has admitted they did the program and in fact he sent
###107 out a note saying
###109 not to renew prescriptions for double pro-growth for women of the ethiopian or
###113 chin if for any reason there is concern that they might not understand the
###117 ramifications of the treatment
###119 i don't think the issue was that they didn't understand the ramp dishes the
###122 treatment issue was as they were coming in they were told
###125 had to get that
###127 sometimes they were lying to us at all you had said back soonish minutes
###131 but their help you with your health
###134 one of the women that were interviewed the thirty different one saying the same
###137 thing i was uh...
###140 saying quoted as saying quote they told us their inoculations they told us
###145 people who for quickly give birth supper
###148 we can get every three months
###150 we said we didn't want to
###153 israel's not the only country with racism
###156 mainly the united states of america we had slavery here and proms a recent
###161 still
###161 exists in this country as well as many other countries
###164 but that inspired
###166 really embarrassing
###168 i mean if you're going to be a jewish state and that you do this to fellow
###171 jews what just 'cause they're african
###174 because they're black or
###176 people of israel should be a livid over that
###179 and i wish they were also livid over the sudan situation
###182 on forcefully pepole out
###186 is really frightening
###188 uh...
###190 fifty two percent of israelis say
###193 that uh... afrin asylum-seekers or quartet cancer
###198 that's fifty two percent that's a majority
###200 and one-third of israelis said that they support
###204 violent attacks
###206 on african seeking asylum
###209 that is at terrible number
###212 parable
###218 there's a lot they could be improved upon in
###220 all the different countries in the world including the u_s_
###223 that's something that israel
###224 definitely needs to work out
###227 young turks
