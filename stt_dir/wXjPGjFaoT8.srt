1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:8,63



2
0:0:8,63 --> 0:0:10,48
JAMIE THOMAS: I lived in Pacific
Beach at the time and


3
0:0:10,48 --> 0:0:12,33
we just kind of lived
in this weird


4
0:0:12,33 --> 0:0:13,8
apartment in Pacific Beach.


5
0:0:13,8 --> 0:0:15,68
Yeah, he stayed with me
for almost a year.


6
0:0:15,68 --> 0:0:17,4
At least it felt like a year.


7
0:0:17,4 --> 0:0:18,92
Yeah, it was a Skate house and
we lived right across the


8
0:0:18,92 --> 0:0:20,35
street from the Alien
Workshop house.


9
0:0:20,35 --> 0:0:23,8
That's how those relationships
started.


10
0:0:23,8 --> 0:0:24,91
JOSH KALIS: Yeah, the Alien
house was right across the


11
0:0:24,91 --> 0:0:27,26
street and it was right
up my alley.


12
0:0:27,26 --> 0:0:30,38
I mean, it was like Clyde
Singleton, Kelly Bird, Drake


13
0:0:30,38 --> 0:0:33,9
Jones, Lenny Kirk,
and Rob Dyrdek.


14
0:0:33,9 --> 0:0:36,32
I mean, all those guys were
there, and it was dominoes,


15
0:0:36,32 --> 0:0:38,92
dice, 40s and weed.


16
0:0:38,92 --> 0:0:40,45
And that's what I liked.


17
0:0:40,45 --> 0:0:42,74
So I hung out with them
all the time.


18
0:0:42,74 --> 0:0:45,52
ROB DYRDEK: And we lived in the
most psycho party house


19
0:0:45,52 --> 0:0:46,39
that was like--


20
0:0:46,39 --> 0:0:51,62
not only was it like the whole
Alien team and [INAUDIBLE] and


21
0:0:51,62 --> 0:0:52,9
Weese and just madness.


22
0:0:52,9 --> 0:0:55,28
Like one of the craziest times
in my entire life, where not


23
0:0:55,28 --> 0:0:57,96
only the four of us lived there,
but then we just--


24
0:0:57,96 --> 0:1:1,42
it was just absolute mayhem
every single night.


25
0:1:1,42 --> 0:1:3,39
Like chicks and rolling
dice every night.


26
0:1:3,39 --> 0:1:6,14
It was like the most psycho
skate house of all time.


27
0:1:6,14 --> 0:1:8,3
JAMIE THOMAS: No, they had the
party house and they had


28
0:1:8,3 --> 0:1:9,38
chicks and stuff.


29
0:1:9,38 --> 0:1:11,555
It was like, it was
obvious, you know?


30
0:1:11,555 --> 0:1:12,53
I never got it.


31
0:1:12,53 --> 0:1:13,75
I never really--


32
0:1:13,75 --> 0:1:14,38
I thought it was cool.


33
0:1:14,38 --> 0:1:15,78
We were like skate homies.


34
0:1:15,78 --> 0:1:18,29
And then he would go over and
hang out at Alien house to get


35
0:1:18,29 --> 0:1:20,98
into like, the party
scene and whatever.


36
0:1:20,98 --> 0:1:23,68
Smoking weed or cigarettes,
whatever.


37
0:1:23,68 --> 0:1:24,3
It was cool.


38
0:1:24,3 --> 0:1:26,4
I'd go over there too sometimes,
and I wouldn't stay


39
0:1:26,4 --> 0:1:26,74
as long as Josh.


40
0:1:26,74 --> 0:1:28,39
Josh would stay every night.


41
0:1:28,39 --> 0:1:30,34
Like we lived like across the
street, so he would just walk


42
0:1:30,34 --> 0:1:32,63
back to my house at like
3:00 in the morning.


43
0:1:32,63 --> 0:1:34,69
And then we'd go skate
the next day.


44
0:1:34,69 --> 0:1:36,2
And then after we were done
skating at night, we'd get


45
0:1:36,2 --> 0:1:37,53
some food together, and then
he'd go over to the Alien


46
0:1:37,53 --> 0:1:38,53
house and hang out.


47
0:1:38,53 --> 0:1:39,91
And I would, like,
I don't know.


48
0:1:39,91 --> 0:1:41,99
I'd hang out with a girl or
watch a movie or something I


49
0:1:41,99 --> 0:1:43,37
had such a mellow lifestyle.


50
0:1:43,37 --> 0:1:45,36
I was like, whatever.


51
0:1:45,36 --> 0:1:46,84
Two totally different worlds.


52
0:1:46,84 --> 0:1:49,9
So basically he lived with me
for like six months to a year.


53
0:1:49,9 --> 0:1:51,71
And we made the Heavy
Metal video.


54
0:1:51,71 --> 0:1:55,454
And he was killing it in
the Heavy Metal zone.


55
0:1:55,454 --> 0:1:58,19



56
0:1:58,19 --> 0:1:59,46
And we were filming every day.


57
0:1:59,46 --> 0:2:2,19
We were just doing random
lines in California.


58
0:2:2,19 --> 0:2:4,1
And it was sick.


59
0:2:4,1 --> 0:2:6,54
And we had a really good
time filming that part.


60
0:2:6,54 --> 0:2:7,58
It was a lot of fun.


61
0:2:7,58 --> 0:2:9,18
And he was skating so good.


62
0:2:9,18 --> 0:2:10,33
He three-flipped a
trash can off the


63
0:2:10,33 --> 0:2:12,11
smallest bump in the world.


64
0:2:12,11 --> 0:2:14,3
Like basically, it was
like a little ripple


65
0:2:14,3 --> 0:2:14,99
in the parking lot.


66
0:2:14,99 --> 0:2:16,4
And he three-flipped it straight
over a trash can.


67
0:2:16,4 --> 0:2:17,92
At the time, it was
like phenomenal.


68
0:2:17,92 --> 0:2:19,18
Like, nobody had seen that.


69
0:2:19,18 --> 0:2:21,81
I remember when that came out,
people were tripping.


70
0:2:21,81 --> 0:2:23,49
Just the way he did
tricks, too.


71
0:2:23,49 --> 0:2:25,18
It was so proper
and so unique.


72
0:2:25,18 --> 0:2:29,54



73
0:2:29,54 --> 0:2:33,22
MIKE BLABAC: A few years later I
moved to SF and he was there


74
0:2:33,22 --> 0:2:34,71
with Jamie, right when
they were filming for


75
0:2:34,71 --> 0:2:35,79
a Toy Machine video.


76
0:2:35,79 --> 0:2:39,88
And then I watched his part
and I was tripping on how,


77
0:2:39,88 --> 0:2:43,0
what an amazing skater he'd
become from that skate rat


78
0:2:43,0 --> 0:2:45,95
that I was chilling with, trying
to figure out how to


79
0:2:45,95 --> 0:2:49,504
shoot photos of three,
four years earlier.


80
0:2:49,504 --> 0:2:50,31
PATRICK O'DELL: Is that him?


81
0:2:50,31 --> 0:2:51,1
MIKE BLABAC: Yeah.


82
0:2:51,1 --> 0:2:52,69
That's his switch crook.


83
0:2:52,69 --> 0:2:55,61
I remember he'd just filmed that
a day or two prior in the


84
0:2:55,61 --> 0:2:56,86
first Toy Machine.


85
0:2:56,86 --> 0:3:0,224



86
0:3:0,224 --> 0:3:3,95
JOSH KALIS: It was cool, but
Jamie, Jamie was always real


87
0:3:3,95 --> 0:3:4,78
cool and real nice.


88
0:3:4,78 --> 0:3:9,1
But I mean, he's a work horse
and he's got a different work


89
0:3:9,1 --> 0:3:11,15
ethic than me.


90
0:3:11,15 --> 0:3:15,3
I told you my work ethic is
like, I need to be enjoying


91
0:3:15,3 --> 0:3:18,5
what I do and having fun.


92
0:3:18,5 --> 0:3:21,36
Then I'm a work horse.


93
0:3:21,36 --> 0:3:25,43
Jamie wants to make sure
he goes and gets


94
0:3:25,43 --> 0:3:27,53
what he needs to get.


95
0:3:27,53 --> 0:3:31,2
And I wasn't that dude.


96
0:3:31,2 --> 0:3:33,26
I like to hang out and work.


97
0:3:33,26 --> 0:3:35,31
And he liked to go to work.


98
0:3:35,31 --> 0:3:38,36
And we just didn't
click like that.


99
0:3:38,36 --> 0:3:39,672
JAMIE THOMAS: Oh my god.


100
0:3:39,672 --> 0:3:41,25
MALE SPEAKER: You
all right, man?


101
0:3:41,25 --> 0:3:42,7
MALE SPEAKER: You bumped
your bill?


102
0:3:42,7 --> 0:3:43,63
JAMIE THOMAS: Oh my god.


103
0:3:43,63 --> 0:3:47,77
ROB DYRDEK: I mean, he lived
with straight-edge, hardcore


104
0:3:47,77 --> 0:3:51,32
Jamie Thomas at Jamie
Thomas's rawest.


105
0:3:51,32 --> 0:3:56,3
Living in a little apartment
in PB, like grinding, like


106
0:3:56,3 --> 0:3:59,65
just building what he
would later become.


107
0:3:59,65 --> 0:4:2,41
And you know, as much as Jamie
had helped him and--


108
0:4:2,41 --> 0:4:4,0
he just wasn't like that.


109
0:4:4,0 --> 0:4:6,72
He just wasn't in that
sort of mindset.


110
0:4:6,72 --> 0:4:9,24



111
0:4:9,24 --> 0:4:11,243
JOSH KALIS: He played too many
practical jokes on me, you


112
0:4:11,243 --> 0:4:11,85
know what mean?


113
0:4:11,85 --> 0:4:15,7
Like, I was kind of a serious
dude who was just getting out


114
0:4:15,7 --> 0:4:17,769
of, like, being a tough guy.


115
0:4:17,769 --> 0:4:19,42
I just couldn't get
down with it.


116
0:4:19,42 --> 0:4:23,39
I couldn't get down
with Ed's crazy--


117
0:4:23,39 --> 0:4:26,4
I couldn't eat hamburgers in the
house, just because like


118
0:4:26,4 --> 0:4:29,71
he's this crazy vegetarian and
the smell bothered him.


119
0:4:29,71 --> 0:4:31,7
So I had to eat outside
all the time.


120
0:4:31,7 --> 0:4:33,9
I just--


121
0:4:33,9 --> 0:4:34,11
I just couldn't deal with it.


122
0:4:34,11 --> 0:4:38,7
We were two completely
different people.


123
0:4:38,7 --> 0:4:40,28
Basically, he smoked, and I used
to buy him food, but I


124
0:4:40,28 --> 0:4:42,19
wouldn't buy him cigarettes
because I was kind of like


125
0:4:42,19 --> 0:4:43,62
straight-edge dude or whatever
at that time.


126
0:4:43,62 --> 0:4:46,74
And I just thought it was lame
that, like, he had these


127
0:4:46,74 --> 0:4:48,17
addictions that I
had to support.


128
0:4:48,17 --> 0:4:50,72
So I just refused to
buy him cigarettes.


129
0:4:50,72 --> 0:4:54,2
So I swear, he basically just
would hustle me for


130
0:4:54,2 --> 0:4:54,68
cigarettes.


131
0:4:54,68 --> 0:4:57,69
He would like, he would ask me,
like, dude, if I do this


132
0:4:57,69 --> 0:5:0,561
trick in this many tries, will
you get me a pack of


133
0:5:0,561 --> 0:5:1,712
cigarettes?


134
0:5:1,712 --> 0:5:3,191
[SCREAM]


135
0:5:3,191 --> 0:5:5,79
So I would like bet him
cigarettes for tricks.


136
0:5:5,79 --> 0:5:8,4
I remember one time he won a
carton off me and he was so,


137
0:5:8,4 --> 0:5:9,68
so psyched.


138
0:5:9,68 --> 0:5:11,865
I asked him to three-flip
this flat gap.


139
0:5:11,865 --> 0:5:13,622
I told him I'd give him a carton
of cigarettes if he


140
0:5:13,622 --> 0:5:15,59
made it next try or something.


141
0:5:15,59 --> 0:5:16,422
And he made it.


142
0:5:16,422 --> 0:5:18,104
It was pretty gnarly
at the time.


143
0:5:18,104 --> 0:5:20,91



144
0:5:20,91 --> 0:5:21,833
JOSH KALIS: What's up, fool!


145
0:5:21,833 --> 0:5:22,54
Ha-ha!


146
0:5:22,54 --> 0:5:24,58
I want my cigarettes, boy.


147
0:5:24,58 --> 0:5:27,51
JAMIE THOMAS: [LAUGHING]


148
0:5:27,51 --> 0:5:29,88
How you gonna skate that
good for cigarettes.


149
0:5:29,88 --> 0:5:34,3



150
0:5:34,3 --> 0:5:34,55
MALE SPEAKER: It's funny.


151
0:5:34,55 --> 0:5:36,35
A lot of people would think that
you wouldn't fit in with


152
0:5:36,35 --> 0:5:38,24
the, like the Toy
Machine vibe.


153
0:5:38,24 --> 0:5:38,79
Like you know what I mean?


154
0:5:38,79 --> 0:5:40,58
It's always almost trivia.


155
0:5:40,58 --> 0:5:42,57
Like, Josh Kalis used to
be on Toy Machine.


156
0:5:42,57 --> 0:5:44,15
JOSH KALIS: Shit, I didn't
fit in that.


157
0:5:44,15 --> 0:5:46,39
That's why I quit, you know?


158
0:5:46,39 --> 0:5:47,2
ANTHONY CLARAVALL: Even
when I met him, he


159
0:5:47,2 --> 0:5:48,35
was over Toy Machine.


160
0:5:48,35 --> 0:5:50,35
I remember going to his
apartment, and like, I


161
0:5:50,35 --> 0:5:52,31
remember looking in his
closet one time.


162
0:5:52,31 --> 0:5:54,185
We were in his room and he
looked in his closet and he


163
0:5:54,185 --> 0:5:57,0
had, like, stacks of t-shirts,
stacks of Toy Machine


164
0:5:57,0 --> 0:5:58,73
t-shirts, in plastic.


165
0:5:58,73 --> 0:5:59,91
Like brand new.


166
0:5:59,91 --> 0:6:1,24
And I mean, to me
that was a trip.


167
0:6:1,24 --> 0:6:2,7
I mean, I was like, wow, man.


168
0:6:2,7 --> 0:6:4,3
And he was like, yeah, man.


169
0:6:4,3 --> 0:6:6,11
That's all garbage.


170
0:6:6,11 --> 0:6:7,66
I ain't gonna ride
for Toy Machine.


171
0:6:7,66 --> 0:6:10,5
And I was just thinking
like, damn, dude.


172
0:6:10,5 --> 0:6:12,86
I kinda want a t-shirt, but I
don't want to ask for one.


173
0:6:12,86 --> 0:6:15,56
JOSH KALIS: I was now into
going to San Francisco.


174
0:6:15,56 --> 0:6:18,54
I stayed with Drake Jones
all the time.


175
0:6:18,54 --> 0:6:21,6
And he was actually working out
a little thing for me to


176
0:6:21,6 --> 0:6:22,69
get on Real.


177
0:6:22,69 --> 0:6:25,1
And I was riding Real boards,
and like, I was


178
0:6:25,1 --> 0:6:26,17
going to ride for Real.


179
0:6:26,17 --> 0:6:27,71
100%.


180
0:6:27,71 --> 0:6:28,93
JAMIE THOMAS: I kind of
saw it coming, though.


181
0:6:28,93 --> 0:6:32,53
He moved to San Francisco and
kind of just got a whole new


182
0:6:32,53 --> 0:6:33,22
crew and stuff.


183
0:6:33,22 --> 0:6:34,84
We started talking a little
less and less.


184
0:6:34,84 --> 0:6:37,61
He was still riding for Toy
Machine, but he was wearing


185
0:6:37,61 --> 0:6:39,14
different shoes every
time I saw him.


186
0:6:39,14 --> 0:6:41,47
He was on flow for three or four
different shoe companies.


187
0:6:41,47 --> 0:6:44,38



188
0:6:44,38 --> 0:6:44,49
JOSH KALIS: Yeah.


189
0:6:44,49 --> 0:6:46,1
JAMIE THOMAS: I think he felt
like he fit in more at Real,


190
0:6:46,1 --> 0:6:49,96
you know, I mean, like you said,
Toy Machine was Ed, who


191
0:6:49,96 --> 0:6:52,47
was kind of artsy and quirky, to
himself, kind of about his


192
0:6:52,47 --> 0:6:53,45
whole vegan vibe.


193
0:6:53,45 --> 0:6:56,24
And I was hard-core
skate-focused.


194
0:6:56,24 --> 0:6:58,19
And I don't know, man.


195
0:6:58,19 --> 0:6:59,13
I can imagine why.


196
0:6:59,13 --> 0:7:0,67
I see the fit-in, you know?


197
0:7:0,67 --> 0:7:2,6
He felt like he fit in.


198
0:7:2,6 --> 0:7:4,96
And so the trade show came up.


199
0:7:4,96 --> 0:7:9,24
And Drake Jones came down and he
was like, yo, Thibault and


200
0:7:9,24 --> 0:7:11,12
those guys, they're ready
to do it, right now.


201
0:7:11,12 --> 0:7:12,53
And I was like, that's
what's up.


202
0:7:12,53 --> 0:7:13,69
All right, I'm gonna go
quit Toy Machine.


203
0:7:13,69 --> 0:7:14,29
Right now.


204
0:7:14,29 --> 0:7:15,55
Right this minute.


205
0:7:15,55 --> 0:7:16,37
And he was like, all right.


206
0:7:16,37 --> 0:7:20,5
So I'm walking down the ASR
hallway and I make a right and


207
0:7:20,5 --> 0:7:23,39
I just bump face-to-face
with Dyrdek.


208
0:7:23,39 --> 0:7:24,87
And Dyrdek was like, where
you going right now?


209
0:7:24,87 --> 0:7:26,81
I was like, I'm going
to quit Toy Machine.


210
0:7:26,81 --> 0:7:29,17
And he was like, for who?


211
0:7:29,17 --> 0:7:31,15
And I was like--


212
0:7:31,15 --> 0:7:33,42
before I could even say Real,
he was like, we'll cut you a


213
0:7:33,42 --> 0:7:34,8
check right now.


214
0:7:34,8 --> 0:7:37,25
And I was like, oh shit.


215
0:7:37,25 --> 0:7:38,41
Let's do it.


216
0:7:38,41 --> 0:7:39,39
And that was it.


217
0:7:39,39 --> 0:7:42,45
I went and met Chris Carter and
he wrote me a check right


218
0:7:42,45 --> 0:7:44,775
there, I think it was like
$250 or some shit.


219
0:7:44,775 --> 0:7:46,53
And he was like, boop.


220
0:7:46,53 --> 0:7:48,616
ROB DYRDEK: It was really a
mutual, like, I would love to


221
0:7:48,616 --> 0:7:49,14
ride for Alien.


222
0:7:49,14 --> 0:7:50,7
You know?


223
0:7:50,7 --> 0:7:54,52
It would be so sick if I
was on like Alien team.


224
0:7:54,52 --> 0:7:56,6
Like you guys have
so much fun.


225
0:7:56,6 --> 0:7:57,265
That'd be sick.


226
0:7:57,265 --> 0:7:59,63
And we're like, dude,
you're on.


227
0:7:59,63 --> 0:8:1,2
If you want to be
on, you're on.


228
0:8:1,2 --> 0:8:2,88
Like no, don't say,
really though?


229
0:8:2,88 --> 0:8:5,3
And we're like, yeah,
you're on.


230
0:8:5,3 --> 0:8:6,16
And that's really
how it worked.


231
0:8:6,16 --> 0:8:6,89
That's how he works.


232
0:8:6,89 --> 0:8:9,5
He'll be like, oh, like say
something, like that's sick.


233
0:8:9,5 --> 0:8:10,17
And like, yep.


234
0:8:10,17 --> 0:8:11,42
You're on


235
0:8:11,42 --> 0:8:13,33
JOSH KALIS: Once I figured
out that Alien was a


236
0:8:13,33 --> 0:8:16,38
real option and I--


237
0:8:16,38 --> 0:8:18,11
that's where I hung out
with every day.


238
0:8:18,11 --> 0:8:19,77
And I had to do it.


239
0:8:19,77 --> 0:8:21,78
I was like, fuck, those
are my homies.


240
0:8:21,78 --> 0:8:22,57
Boom.


241
0:8:22,57 --> 0:8:23,66
JAMIE THOMAS: Yeah, of course
it was a bummer, man.


242
0:8:23,66 --> 0:8:25,59
I mean, I'd--


243
0:8:25,59 --> 0:8:27,355
I was--


244
0:8:27,355 --> 0:8:29,965
you know, like any time when you
like help somebody out and


245
0:8:29,965 --> 0:8:32,679
you like help them out of
whatever situation they're in,


246
0:8:32,679 --> 0:8:36,98
I kind of was like the dude he
leaned on for a long time, for


247
0:8:36,98 --> 0:8:40,15
emotional and financial support,
like in every aspect.


248
0:8:40,15 --> 0:8:43,26
And when you give like that, I
mean, it obviously feels good


249
0:8:43,26 --> 0:8:44,15
to help somebody out.


250
0:8:44,15 --> 0:8:47,91
But if they're able to just
break it off at like a


251
0:8:47,91 --> 0:8:50,36
moment's notice, it feels kind
of gnarly, you know?


252
0:8:50,36 --> 0:8:51,39
It's almost like you're
in like a


253
0:8:51,39 --> 0:8:52,56
relationship or something.


254
0:8:52,56 --> 0:8:55,34
Not to sound too sappy,
but it was pretty,


255
0:8:55,34 --> 0:8:56,585
it was pretty heavy.


256
0:8:56,585 --> 0:8:58,11
I remember being
pretty bummed.


257
0:8:58,11 --> 0:9:0,83
Like it rocked me for like a
week or two, where I was just,


258
0:9:0,83 --> 0:9:2,735
like, lump in your throat.


259
0:9:2,735 --> 0:9:4,0
It sucks.


260
0:9:4,0 --> 0:9:5,85
It was never really that
weird between us.


261
0:9:5,85 --> 0:9:8,33
I was a little bit butt-hurt
for a while,


262
0:9:8,33 --> 0:9:9,59
but I got over it.


263
0:9:9,59 --> 0:9:12,5
And when I'd see him, I'd always
act like it was cool,


264
0:9:12,5 --> 0:9:14,61
even if I was a little
bitter still.


265
0:9:14,61 --> 0:9:17,32



266
0:9:17,32 --> 0:9:17,79
It was all right, man.


267
0:9:17,79 --> 0:9:18,55
I got over it.


268
0:9:18,55 --> 0:9:19,77
We just moved on.


269
0:9:19,77 --> 0:9:21,86
At any rate, I saw him like
five years later.


270
0:9:21,86 --> 0:9:24,42
I came through Philly and
he like, sat me down.


271
0:9:24,42 --> 0:9:26,57
We were away from the
crew for a minute.


272
0:9:26,57 --> 0:9:28,83
And he was just like man, I just
want to tell you how much


273
0:9:28,83 --> 0:9:31,45
I appreciate you helping
me out back in the day.


274
0:9:31,45 --> 0:9:33,54
If it weren't for you I wouldn't
be in skating right


275
0:9:33,54 --> 0:9:35,85
now, and I just kind of
want you to know that.


276
0:9:35,85 --> 0:9:37,7
And I was like, cool, man.


277
0:9:37,7 --> 0:9:38,72
Thanks.


278
0:9:38,72 --> 0:9:39,5
JOSH KALIS: Yeah, I got to--


279
0:9:39,5 --> 0:9:44,19
I got to give way more credit to
my dude Jamie Thomas, man.


280
0:9:44,19 --> 0:9:50,4
Like that dude made all this
shit possible for me.


281
0:9:50,4 --> 0:9:52,31
When he gave me the opportunity
to come out here,


282
0:9:52,31 --> 0:9:57,21
and like paid for me for six,
eight months or whatever, just


283
0:9:57,21 --> 0:10:0,8
for me to like turn around and
quit the company that I rode


284
0:10:0,8 --> 0:10:2,1
for with him--


285
0:10:2,1 --> 0:10:3,97
I mean, that dude pretty
much paved the


286
0:10:3,97 --> 0:10:6,69
whole way for me, man.


287
0:10:6,69 --> 0:10:8,95
I guess if I owe anyone in this
shit, it would be him.


288
0:10:8,95 --> 0:10:10,396
You know what I mean?


289
0:10:10,396 --> 0:10:13,6
He's a good dude.


290
0:10:13,6 --> 0:10:15,23
PATRICK O'DELL: It would have
been funny if you were in


291
0:10:15,23 --> 0:10:17,6
Welcome to Hell.


292
0:10:17,6 --> 0:10:19,24
JOSH KALIS: Yeah, I think
I just missed that one.


293
0:10:19,24 --> 0:10:21,9
I just missed Welcome to Hell.


294
0:10:21,9 --> 0:10:23,8
You know, actually, it was
probably a good thing I missed


295
0:10:23,8 --> 0:10:27,11
Welcome to Hell, because I had
already broken both ankles and


296
0:10:27,11 --> 0:10:30,975
a foot by that time, and
I just couldn't be a


297
0:10:30,975 --> 0:10:33,4
stair-jumper or a rail-jumper
anymore.


298
0:10:33,4 --> 0:10:36,62
And I don't know what the hell
I would have done if I would


299
0:10:36,62 --> 0:10:40,27
have stayed and Jamie take
me to the rail spots.


300
0:10:40,27 --> 0:10:41,52
Like, oh my god.


301
0:10:41,52 --> 0:12:41,52
