1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:4,954



2
0:0:4,954 --> 0:0:6,12
WINNIE LAM: Hello everybody.


3
0:0:6,12 --> 0:0:7,74
I'm Winne Lam.


4
0:0:7,74 --> 0:0:12,9
It's surreal to be standing 10
feet away from the amazing race


5
0:0:12,9 --> 0:0:13,857
car driver, Danica Patrick.


6
0:0:13,857 --> 0:0:15,69
And I'm thrilled that
Claire Johnson is here


7
0:0:15,69 --> 0:0:18,97
today to do the fireside
chat with Danica.


8
0:0:18,97 --> 0:0:22,37
There are many women Googlers
who are in technical roles


9
0:0:22,37 --> 0:0:24,349
where there are
more men than women.


10
0:0:24,349 --> 0:0:26,14
So we thought it would
be inspiring to hear


11
0:0:26,14 --> 0:0:28,49
Danica's story
about how she excels


12
0:0:28,49 --> 0:0:31,32
in the male-dominated
field of race car driving.


13
0:0:31,32 --> 0:0:34,6
So without further ado, please
help me give a very warm


14
0:0:34,6 --> 0:0:35,26
welcome to Danica Patrick.


15
0:0:35,26 --> 0:0:42,717



16
0:0:42,717 --> 0:0:43,8
DANICA PATRICK: Thank you.


17
0:0:43,8 --> 0:0:44,74
Oh my gosh.


18
0:0:44,74 --> 0:0:45,702
Thank you for coming.


19
0:0:45,702 --> 0:0:47,91
We were just talking about
how sometimes people come,


20
0:0:47,91 --> 0:0:48,93
sometimes people don't.


21
0:0:48,93 --> 0:0:51,57
And I said that the
worst fear for someone


22
0:0:51,57 --> 0:0:53,77
like me is that you do
these and nobody shows up.


23
0:0:53,77 --> 0:0:57,3
Or you get introduced somewhere
and nobody knows who you are.


24
0:0:57,3 --> 0:0:58,26
So thank you all for coming.


25
0:0:58,26 --> 0:0:59,47
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
I think my worst fear is


26
0:0:59,47 --> 0:1:0,96
that I would host this
and no one would be here.


27
0:1:0,96 --> 0:1:2,9
But you guys, nice job.


28
0:1:2,9 --> 0:1:3,496
We filled the room.


29
0:1:3,496 --> 0:1:5,12
I think we could've
used a bigger room.


30
0:1:5,12 --> 0:1:6,828
So a couple things
because I know you all


31
0:1:6,828 --> 0:1:8,71
want to hear from Danica.


32
0:1:8,71 --> 0:1:10,51
Just so you know
about this talk.


33
0:1:10,51 --> 0:1:12,25
I feel really pleased.


34
0:1:12,25 --> 0:1:14,81
And I want to think Winnie
and Nicole and Rich.


35
0:1:14,81 --> 0:1:17,47
And folks from the Google
GoDaddy team who helped


36
0:1:17,47 --> 0:1:18,27
prep this.


37
0:1:18,27 --> 0:1:21,67
We have some great slides and
photos and a couple of videos


38
0:1:21,67 --> 0:1:22,839
to show.


39
0:1:22,839 --> 0:1:24,38
And we also have a
bunch of questions


40
0:1:24,38 --> 0:1:27,74
that luckily I was prepared
with to go through.


41
0:1:27,74 --> 0:1:31,9
We probably aren't going to
have any time for any live Q&A.


42
0:1:31,9 --> 0:1:32,76
But I have looked at the Dory.


43
0:1:32,76 --> 0:1:34,62
So if you have stuff
on the Dory-- and Mave


44
0:1:34,62 --> 0:1:37,802
is going to pass me notes--
Dory is our internal Q&A tool.


45
0:1:37,802 --> 0:1:38,76
DANICA PATRICK: Got it.


46
0:1:38,76 --> 0:1:39,17
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: We're
all about the tech here.


47
0:1:39,17 --> 0:1:39,42
DANICA PATRICK: OK.


48
0:1:39,42 --> 0:1:40,295
I was like, I don't--


49
0:1:40,295 --> 0:1:40,36
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: So people
can ask questions from there.


50
0:1:40,36 --> 0:1:42,241
DANICA PATRICK:
--know who she is.


51
0:1:42,241 --> 0:1:43,74
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: She's like, I


52
0:1:43,74 --> 0:1:45,323
have no idea what
you're talking about


53
0:1:45,323 --> 0:1:47,136
but please don't bring it up.


54
0:1:47,136 --> 0:1:49,1
But anyway, so we'll
keep an eye on the Dory.


55
0:1:49,1 --> 0:1:51,23
But hopefully we'll get
to most of the topics


56
0:1:51,23 --> 0:1:52,42
that you all have.


57
0:1:52,42 --> 0:1:55,81
And in full disclosure,
I like to drive fast,


58
0:1:55,81 --> 0:1:59,39
but I do not know that much
about race car driving.


59
0:1:59,39 --> 0:2:0,39
DANICA PATRICK: Perfect.


60
0:2:0,39 --> 0:2:1,1
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: And some--


61
0:2:1,1 --> 0:2:1,22
DANICA PATRICK: Neither do I.


62
0:2:1,22 --> 0:2:3,511
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: --of
the folks in the audience--


63
0:2:3,511 --> 0:2:5,28
I think you know a
lot-- may not as well.


64
0:2:5,28 --> 0:2:8,574
So I may follow up and ask
you to clarify a few things.


65
0:2:8,574 --> 0:2:10,99
Don't you want to get out of
NASCAR and all the left turns


66
0:2:10,99 --> 0:2:12,81
sometimes?


67
0:2:12,81 --> 0:2:14,439
Go back to your
open wheel roots?


68
0:2:14,439 --> 0:2:16,48
DANICA PATRICK: We have
a couple of road courses.


69
0:2:16,48 --> 0:2:19,2
But what I notice in the
gym is that I'm definitely


70
0:2:19,2 --> 0:2:22,82
dominant pushing with my right
and pulling with my left.


71
0:2:22,82 --> 0:2:25,77
It's very out of balance
when I use dumbbells.


72
0:2:25,77 --> 0:2:27,51
And they're independent.


73
0:2:27,51 --> 0:2:29,9
And I'm like, yep.


74
0:2:29,9 --> 0:2:30,12
And nope.


75
0:2:30,12 --> 0:2:30,937
Can't get there.


76
0:2:30,937 --> 0:2:33,2
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: So
when you pick your gowns


77
0:2:33,2 --> 0:2:35,5
for award shows would that
could be an issue for you?


78
0:2:35,5 --> 0:2:36,458
DANICA PATRICK: Always.


79
0:2:36,458 --> 0:2:37,144
Shoulders.


80
0:2:37,144 --> 0:2:38,56
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: We're good.


81
0:2:38,56 --> 0:2:40,66
We're already getting into it.


82
0:2:40,66 --> 0:2:43,41
So just so folks don't-- if you
don't know who Danica Patrick


83
0:2:43,41 --> 0:2:47,9
is, I'm not sure why that is--
but she's the most searched


84
0:2:47,9 --> 0:2:47,92
for athlete.


85
0:2:47,92 --> 0:2:49,97
And we're a search company
among other things.


86
0:2:49,97 --> 0:2:53,1
So certainly she's on our radar.


87
0:2:53,1 --> 0:2:56,64
But has been an amazing
role model for women.


88
0:2:56,64 --> 0:2:57,33
For girls.


89
0:2:57,33 --> 0:3:0,7
But also for anyone who's
an aspiring race car driver.


90
0:3:0,7 --> 0:3:2,59
And grew up in the sport.


91
0:3:2,59 --> 0:3:5,202
And even went to
Europe for some time--


92
0:3:5,202 --> 0:3:7,16
which her parents let
her do, which maybe we'll


93
0:3:7,16 --> 0:3:10,53
ask how that went--
to continue her racing


94
0:3:10,53 --> 0:3:12,9
education and practice.


95
0:3:12,9 --> 0:3:13,81
And has driven with Indy car.


96
0:3:13,81 --> 0:3:16,92
And is now with NASCAR
on the Sprint Cup Series


97
0:3:16,92 --> 0:3:17,935
if I'm right about that.


98
0:3:17,935 --> 0:3:19,7
DANICA PATRICK:
You got that right.


99
0:3:19,7 --> 0:3:20,695
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
And has been-- I


100
0:3:20,695 --> 0:3:25,4
think folks know-- the GoDaddy
spokesperson for 13 years.


101
0:3:25,4 --> 0:3:26,78
DANICA PATRICK:
Well, been in 13.


102
0:3:26,78 --> 0:3:28,76
After this year, 13
Superbowl commercials.


103
0:3:28,76 --> 0:3:30,984
But since 2007.


104
0:3:30,984 --> 0:3:32,4
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: Since 2007.


105
0:3:32,4 --> 0:3:32,9
OK.


106
0:3:32,9 --> 0:3:34,57
So just a lot of
Superbowl commercials.


107
0:3:34,57 --> 0:3:35,62
DANICA PATRICK: A lot of
SuperBowl commercials.


108
0:3:35,62 --> 0:3:37,36
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: Since 2007.


109
0:3:37,36 --> 0:3:40,119
And has also hosted the
Country Music Awards.


110
0:3:40,119 --> 0:3:42,16
DANICA PATRICK: Yeah the
American Country Awards.


111
0:3:42,16 --> 0:3:45,166
It was last month in Vegas.


112
0:3:45,166 --> 0:3:47,79
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: And been
on the cover of various hotshot


113
0:3:47,79 --> 0:3:48,319
magazines.


114
0:3:48,319 --> 0:3:49,36
We have one of them here.


115
0:3:49,36 --> 0:3:51,29
Sports Illustrated
is one of them.


116
0:3:51,29 --> 0:3:52,33
ESPN magazine, right?


117
0:3:52,33 --> 0:3:53,96
I think saw that one.


118
0:3:53,96 --> 0:3:56,31
Anyway, so she-- And you
have your own company, right?


119
0:3:56,31 --> 0:3:57,374
"Danica Racing."


120
0:3:57,374 --> 0:3:59,29
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
You're a businesswoman.


121
0:3:59,29 --> 0:4:0,956
DANICA PATRICK: I
write President on it.


122
0:4:0,956 --> 0:4:3,44
So it makes me feel really
cool when they say title.


123
0:4:3,44 --> 0:4:4,93
Your signature and title.


124
0:4:4,93 --> 0:4:6,6
And I write president.


125
0:4:6,6 --> 0:4:7,24
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Or
if you go through customs


126
0:4:7,24 --> 0:4:8,67
and they say, what's your job?


127
0:4:8,67 --> 0:4:10,211
DANICA PATRICK: I
don't actually know


128
0:4:10,211 --> 0:4:12,53
what to write when it comes
to that point in time.


129
0:4:12,53 --> 0:4:13,66
I write the same thing now.


130
0:4:13,66 --> 0:4:16,5
But for a long time I didn't
know what to write for my job.


131
0:4:16,5 --> 0:4:17,18
Driver?


132
0:4:17,18 --> 0:4:19,22
Or race car driver?


133
0:4:19,22 --> 0:4:21,74
Or professional driver?


134
0:4:21,74 --> 0:4:24,29
Automotive driver?


135
0:4:24,29 --> 0:4:25,68
President?


136
0:4:25,68 --> 0:4:26,68
I mean, that would help.


137
0:4:26,68 --> 0:4:27,2
I would think.


138
0:4:27,2 --> 0:4:28,936
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
I think race car driver


139
0:4:28,936 --> 0:4:30,26
might be cooler than president.


140
0:4:30,26 --> 0:4:31,76
DANICA PATRICK: I
write race car driver.


141
0:4:31,76 --> 0:4:34,2
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: I
think-- I'm down with that.


142
0:4:34,2 --> 0:4:35,6
DANICA PATRICK: Wow, you think
that's cooler than president?


143
0:4:35,6 --> 0:4:36,43
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: I do.


144
0:4:36,43 --> 0:4:38,52
Danica Patrick: Well, it's
probably a lot easier.


145
0:4:38,52 --> 0:4:39,61
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: That
might be the state of politics


146
0:4:39,61 --> 0:4:40,1
these days.


147
0:4:40,1 --> 0:4:40,509
All right.


148
0:4:40,509 --> 0:4:41,27
Anyway.


149
0:4:41,27 --> 0:4:44,26
Let's talk a little
bit about when


150
0:4:44,26 --> 0:4:47,54
you knew that this was
a passion of yours.


151
0:4:47,54 --> 0:4:49,69
DANICA PATRICK: Well, I
started racing go-karts


152
0:4:49,69 --> 0:4:51,1
when I was 10 years old.


153
0:4:51,1 --> 0:4:54,63
And it really was because
my sister wanted to race.


154
0:4:54,63 --> 0:4:55,2
There I am.


155
0:4:55,2 --> 0:4:55,699
Adorable.


156
0:4:55,699 --> 0:4:56,41
Yup.


157
0:4:56,41 --> 0:4:58,6
I still need glasses,
but I wear contacts.


158
0:4:58,6 --> 0:4:59,97
And I'm positively blind.


159
0:4:59,97 --> 0:5:1,695



160
0:5:1,695 --> 0:5:3,82
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: And
your sister was younger?


161
0:5:3,82 --> 0:5:5,58
DANICA PATRICK: My
sister was eight


162
0:5:5,58 --> 0:5:10,23
and I was 10 years old, which
is why my number was 10.


163
0:5:10,23 --> 0:5:14,37
So it was really just something
to do together as a family.


164
0:5:14,37 --> 0:5:16,29
And I just took to it.


165
0:5:16,29 --> 0:5:18,49
I started winning my first year.


166
0:5:18,49 --> 0:5:20,72
And I won the championship.


167
0:5:20,72 --> 0:5:22,4
But this kid blocked
me and I didn't


168
0:5:22,4 --> 0:5:24,233
know how to get around
because he drove down


169
0:5:24,233 --> 0:5:26,804
the inside of the straightaway.


170
0:5:26,804 --> 0:5:27,97
I figured it out after that.


171
0:5:27,97 --> 0:5:29,761
You just push him off
the end of the track.


172
0:5:29,761 --> 0:5:32,73
But I didn't know then.


173
0:5:32,73 --> 0:5:34,97
But I think really it
came from the first year.


174
0:5:34,97 --> 0:5:36,64
And just being successful.


175
0:5:36,64 --> 0:5:38,69
And I really liked
practicing and getting


176
0:5:38,69 --> 0:5:40,62
better and seeing improvement.


177
0:5:40,62 --> 0:5:43,93
And I mean, we all tend to
like things that we're good at.


178
0:5:43,93 --> 0:5:47,18
And it was something that went
well pretty quickly for me.


179
0:5:47,18 --> 0:5:50,54
So it was really year one.


180
0:5:50,54 --> 0:5:53,53
I thought I would go to
college for engineering.


181
0:5:53,53 --> 0:5:54,3
But I didn't.


182
0:5:54,3 --> 0:5:55,22
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
We support that.


183
0:5:55,22 --> 0:5:56,11
We like that.


184
0:5:56,11 --> 0:5:56,98
DANICA PATRICK: I
ended up going--


185
0:5:56,98 --> 0:5:57,19
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: We
all support the driving.


186
0:5:57,19 --> 0:5:58,18
DANICA PATRICK: I ended
up going to England.


187
0:5:58,18 --> 0:5:59,98
And I'm not sure
which one was harder.


188
0:5:59,98 --> 0:6:1,688
Which one would have
been harder, England


189
0:6:1,688 --> 0:6:2,82
or engineering college?


190
0:6:2,82 --> 0:6:4,87
But I wanted to go to
college for engineering


191
0:6:4,87 --> 0:6:7,66
so I could know how
to work on my car.


192
0:6:7,66 --> 0:6:10,15
But I went to a different
kind of college ultimately.


193
0:6:10,15 --> 0:6:12,585
But those were my
plans at 10 years old.


194
0:6:12,585 --> 0:6:13,96
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: So how old


195
0:6:13,96 --> 0:6:15,29
were you when you
went to England?


196
0:6:15,29 --> 0:6:16,29
DANICA PATRICK: I was 16.


197
0:6:16,29 --> 0:6:18,23
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Wow
and so your family said--


198
0:6:18,23 --> 0:6:20,52
DANICA PATRICK: Yeah I was
a junior in high school.


199
0:6:20,52 --> 0:6:24,64
And I wasn't really even
there very much junior year.


200
0:6:24,64 --> 0:6:28,49
I went over to England
in the first semester.


201
0:6:28,49 --> 0:6:31,4
I went over for two of
the four months of school.


202
0:6:31,4 --> 0:6:33,58
And did a little bit of racing.


203
0:6:33,58 --> 0:6:35,71
And then I went back
full time after that.


204
0:6:35,71 --> 0:6:38,67
So I left high school halfway
through my junior year.


205
0:6:38,67 --> 0:6:41,159
And I've never looked back.


206
0:6:41,159 --> 0:6:42,95
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
And was the thinking


207
0:6:42,95 --> 0:6:45,199
on that, that you would just
get more experience and--


208
0:6:45,199 --> 0:6:46,19
DANICA PATRICK: Yeah.


209
0:6:46,19 --> 0:6:50,73
It was described to me
that I can learn more there


210
0:6:50,73 --> 0:6:53,6
in one year than five
years in America.


211
0:6:53,6 --> 0:6:57,19
And the opportunity
was there to do it.


212
0:6:57,19 --> 0:6:59,77
Really what ended up
happening was this person--


213
0:6:59,77 --> 0:7:4,11
that told me that I could learn
more there than in the states--


214
0:7:4,11 --> 0:7:6,68
had followed my career
then for a couple of years.


215
0:7:6,68 --> 0:7:9,33
And contacted me
when I turned 16.


216
0:7:9,33 --> 0:7:11,1
And said, we've
been watching you.


217
0:7:11,1 --> 0:7:12,715
We want to help
you in your career.


218
0:7:12,715 --> 0:7:15,9
And that's when I went over
to England for a little while


219
0:7:15,9 --> 0:7:16,3
to check things out.


220
0:7:16,3 --> 0:7:17,7
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: This is
someone in the British racing


221
0:7:17,7 --> 0:7:17,57
scene?


222
0:7:17,57 --> 0:7:19,95
DANICA PATRICK: There
was an Englishman.


223
0:7:19,95 --> 0:7:22,87
And then there was
a Texas-based family


224
0:7:22,87 --> 0:7:26,92
that had been involved in
racing for a long time.


225
0:7:26,92 --> 0:7:30,89
So they had followed my
career for a couple of years.


226
0:7:30,89 --> 0:7:33,4
And fortunately
saw me win a lot.


227
0:7:33,4 --> 0:7:36,43
And after that I
moved to England.


228
0:7:36,43 --> 0:7:37,93
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: That's great.


229
0:7:37,93 --> 0:7:40,34
So we have gotten
a few questions


230
0:7:40,34 --> 0:7:41,86
on our moderator tool.


231
0:7:41,86 --> 0:7:44,8
And certainly, as
Winnie mentioned,


232
0:7:44,8 --> 0:7:46,91
our Women at Google group
is interested in-- as you


233
0:7:46,91 --> 0:7:49,79
were coming up through the sport
and in those earlier years,


234
0:7:49,79 --> 0:7:51,29
I'm sure it still
is the case today,


235
0:7:51,29 --> 0:7:53,489
but you're a little bit
more established now.


236
0:7:53,489 --> 0:7:55,28
You were certainly
contending with the fact


237
0:7:55,28 --> 0:7:57,57
that it was more of a
male-dominated sport.


238
0:7:57,57 --> 0:8:0,94
Although women, I think
as I understand it,


239
0:8:0,94 --> 0:8:4,13
from the history of NASCAR were
allowed to race since 1949.


240
0:8:4,13 --> 0:8:6,62
Not the case for
the IndyCar races.


241
0:8:6,62 --> 0:8:8,24
But anyway, women
were allowed to race


242
0:8:8,24 --> 0:8:10,14
and there were some
women who raced.


243
0:8:10,14 --> 0:8:12,65
But it just really, as
this happens sometimes


244
0:8:12,65 --> 0:8:14,89
in engineering
classes, very few.


245
0:8:14,89 --> 0:8:18,35
And for you, you've become
arguably the most famous


246
0:8:18,35 --> 0:8:19,89
female race car driver.


247
0:8:19,89 --> 0:8:22,12
How was it coming up
through the sport?


248
0:8:22,12 --> 0:8:24,26
Did you find that there
were overt obstacles?


249
0:8:24,26 --> 0:8:27,0
Or was it just
occasionally an issue?


250
0:8:27,0 --> 0:8:31,5
DANICA PATRICK: I think that the
big difference between me, when


251
0:8:31,5 --> 0:8:34,97
I came along versus when
some of the women in the past


252
0:8:34,97 --> 0:8:38,26
in the earlier years, were there
is that-- take for instance


253
0:8:38,26 --> 0:8:41,9
my first Indy 500 was 2005.


254
0:8:41,9 --> 0:8:45,1
And you had to do something
called rookie orientation,


255
0:8:45,1 --> 0:8:47,31
which meant you had
to go out and do 190


256
0:8:47,31 --> 0:8:49,42
for five laps or 10 laps.


257
0:8:49,42 --> 0:8:50,92
And then you had to do 200.


258
0:8:50,92 --> 0:8:52,27
And then you do 210.


259
0:8:52,27 --> 0:8:53,17
And then 220.


260
0:8:53,17 --> 0:8:54,22
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: That
would be miles per hour?


261
0:8:54,22 --> 0:8:55,53
DANICA PATRICK: Yes.


262
0:8:55,53 --> 0:8:57,73
And so it was just a
build up in the process.


263
0:8:57,73 --> 0:9:4,9
And so I would come
in from making a run--


264
0:9:4,9 --> 0:9:6,0
and once you've passed
your test and gone


265
0:9:6,0 --> 0:9:9,2
through all those speeds, then
you get to practice basically.


266
0:9:9,2 --> 0:9:12,22
And I'd come in and I was
basically the quickest car.


267
0:9:12,22 --> 0:9:15,4
So I would come into
the pits and everybody


268
0:9:15,4 --> 0:9:15,81
would be cheering.


269
0:9:15,81 --> 0:9:19,87
There was a huge slew of
photographers and journalists


270
0:9:19,87 --> 0:9:20,73
in front of my car.


271
0:9:20,73 --> 0:9:22,55
And on the pit
wall there was tons


272
0:9:22,55 --> 0:9:24,56
of fans behind the
behind the fence.


273
0:9:24,56 --> 0:9:28,64
And I was embraced in general.


274
0:9:28,64 --> 0:9:29,89
I'm sure there's still haters.


275
0:9:29,89 --> 0:9:31,287
But they exist always.


276
0:9:31,287 --> 0:9:31,87
In everything.


277
0:9:31,87 --> 0:9:33,244
There's always
going to be people


278
0:9:33,244 --> 0:9:35,43
that don't like you
or believe in you.


279
0:9:35,43 --> 0:9:38,58
But in general, very well
received and embraced.


280
0:9:38,58 --> 0:9:40,8
And I think that's
a big difference.


281
0:9:40,8 --> 0:9:42,86
In the past I don't think
that was there for them.


282
0:9:42,86 --> 0:9:46,14



283
0:9:46,14 --> 0:9:47,95
Everyone has to
prove themselves.


284
0:9:47,95 --> 0:9:49,22
There's no doubt about that.


285
0:9:49,22 --> 0:9:51,37
I face it as a rookie.


286
0:9:51,37 --> 0:9:52,61
I face it as a girl.


287
0:9:52,61 --> 0:9:54,49
And I face it as
just a competitor.


288
0:9:54,49 --> 0:9:59,53
As a person trying
to beat other people.


289
0:9:59,53 --> 0:10:1,82
So it's always a
challenge to earn respect.


290
0:10:1,82 --> 0:10:5,99
But I think that there's
probably a few more doubters


291
0:10:5,99 --> 0:10:6,78
along the way.


292
0:10:6,78 --> 0:10:8,99
Or it may take a few
extra times of proving


293
0:10:8,99 --> 0:10:13,23
what you do, what you can
do, before people really


294
0:10:13,23 --> 0:10:13,8
believe it.


295
0:10:13,8 --> 0:10:16,59
And then of course there's
just some that never do.


296
0:10:16,59 --> 0:10:19,78
But it's a process.


297
0:10:19,78 --> 0:10:20,66
And still going on.


298
0:10:20,66 --> 0:10:23,14
And I'm sure it will for awhile.


299
0:10:23,14 --> 0:10:25,97
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: And
talking about the Indy 500,


300
0:10:25,97 --> 0:10:28,85
you were the first woman-- you
lead for 19 laps in the Indy


301
0:10:28,85 --> 0:10:31,98
500 when you were 23 years old.


302
0:10:31,98 --> 0:10:36,155
So did you feel like you
proved it at that point?


303
0:10:36,155 --> 0:10:37,78
DANICA PATRICK: Well,
I think that when


304
0:10:37,78 --> 0:10:43,49
I got my ride in IndyCar-- It
came the year before at Indy.


305
0:10:43,49 --> 0:10:46,42
And I had gone to a press
conference at the track.


306
0:10:46,42 --> 0:10:48,1
And I wasn't racing.


307
0:10:48,1 --> 0:10:51,86
But the team that I drove
for in the lower level racing


308
0:10:51,86 --> 0:10:52,78
had an IndyCar team.


309
0:10:52,78 --> 0:10:54,91
And so I went to a press
conference on Thursday


310
0:10:54,91 --> 0:10:55,786
before the race.


311
0:10:55,786 --> 0:10:57,16
And all of a sudden
my boss said,


312
0:10:57,16 --> 0:10:59,59
and Danica's going to drive
in IndyCars next year.


313
0:10:59,59 --> 0:11:1,965
And I was like, I mean,
I'm not going to argue,


314
0:11:1,965 --> 0:11:3,84
but I didn't know you
were going to say that.


315
0:11:3,84 --> 0:11:7,55
So it came pretty suddenly.


316
0:11:7,55 --> 0:11:11,95
But I got into it in my first
year of Indy Car and thought,


317
0:11:11,95 --> 0:11:13,15
it's not a for sure thing.


318
0:11:13,15 --> 0:11:14,57
You still have to do it.


319
0:11:14,57 --> 0:11:16,77
Just getting there is not there.


320
0:11:16,77 --> 0:11:19,65
You need to do some good
things and establish yourself.


321
0:11:19,65 --> 0:11:21,2
And get some roots in the sport.


322
0:11:21,2 --> 0:11:24,3
And have proper
support from sponsors.


323
0:11:24,3 --> 0:11:26,8
And after that Indy 500 I did.


324
0:11:26,8 --> 0:11:31,272
There was a certain level I
felt a little better after that.


325
0:11:31,272 --> 0:11:32,98
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
I mean you clearly


326
0:11:32,98 --> 0:11:33,85
had earned your way.


327
0:11:33,85 --> 0:11:37,17
DANICA PATRICK: It was
definitely a pivotal year.


328
0:11:37,17 --> 0:11:39,78
And it was a magical month.


329
0:11:39,78 --> 0:11:42,3
And it was full
of highs and lows.


330
0:11:42,3 --> 0:11:45,25
And the lows were really just
that I was running out energy


331
0:11:45,25 --> 0:11:46,11
to do interviews.


332
0:11:46,11 --> 0:11:48,55
But that's a good
problem to have.


333
0:11:48,55 --> 0:11:49,453
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
Luckily we're catching her


334
0:11:49,453 --> 0:11:51,202
at the beginning before
the season starts.


335
0:11:51,202 --> 0:11:53,68
DANICA PATRICK: This is my
first day at work, everyone,


336
0:11:53,68 --> 0:11:56,172
this year.


337
0:11:56,172 --> 0:11:58,63
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: That's
true for a lot of us as well.


338
0:11:58,63 --> 0:11:58,926
DANICA PATRICK: Is it?


339
0:11:58,926 --> 0:11:59,426
OK.


340
0:11:59,426 --> 0:12:0,6
Well, welcome back.


341
0:12:0,6 --> 0:12:1,38
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
On the holidays.


342
0:12:1,38 --> 0:12:3,6
DANICA PATRICK: High on
sugar from the holidays?


343
0:12:3,6 --> 0:12:5,84
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Exactly.


344
0:12:5,84 --> 0:12:9,8
So, then, you won the
IndyCar race in Japan.


345
0:12:9,8 --> 0:12:13,279
And did that feel like--
how big a deal was that?


346
0:12:13,279 --> 0:12:14,32
Or was it not a big deal?


347
0:12:14,32 --> 0:12:16,278
Because you already kind
of made it in IndyCar.


348
0:12:16,278 --> 0:12:18,38
DANICA PATRICK: Well,
I mean it's something


349
0:12:18,38 --> 0:12:23,7
that I am-- I even said it
back then in 2008-- that it


350
0:12:23,7 --> 0:12:24,27
felt long overdue for me.


351
0:12:24,27 --> 0:12:27,2
There were opportunities that
were probably even better


352
0:12:27,2 --> 0:12:30,63
to win along the way
that didn't happen.


353
0:12:30,63 --> 0:12:33,38
Versus that day.


354
0:12:33,38 --> 0:12:36,49
So it was but there was
somebody-- another driver told


355
0:12:36,49 --> 0:12:40,4
me that year at some point,
he said, you know what?


356
0:12:40,4 --> 0:12:42,67
One day you're going to be doing
just the same thing that you've


357
0:12:42,67 --> 0:12:44,41
been doing every day
and you're going to win.


358
0:12:44,41 --> 0:12:45,85
And that's exactly
what happened.


359
0:12:45,85 --> 0:12:47,933
You're doing the same thing
that you do every day.


360
0:12:47,933 --> 0:12:52,0
And so it was a
feeling of relief.


361
0:12:52,0 --> 0:12:57,24
And for the casual fan
or the casual consumer,


362
0:12:57,24 --> 0:12:59,99
first place and winning is
very easy to understand.


363
0:12:59,99 --> 0:13:4,18
And so it was nice
from that perspective.


364
0:13:4,18 --> 0:13:11,1
And there was a lot of talk
and argumentative points


365
0:13:11,1 --> 0:13:12,29
about I haven't won.


366
0:13:12,29 --> 0:13:14,4
And so it did take care of that.


367
0:13:14,4 --> 0:13:14,36
And of course eventually--


368
0:13:14,36 --> 0:13:16,29
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
It checked off that box.


369
0:13:16,29 --> 0:13:17,33
DANICA PATRICK: So,
I mean, I wanted


370
0:13:17,33 --> 0:13:18,496
to win a lot more than that.


371
0:13:18,496 --> 0:13:20,11
And there were opportunities.


372
0:13:20,11 --> 0:13:25,35
But it seemed like my talent
as a driver in IndyCar


373
0:13:25,35 --> 0:13:28,86
was going like this and
my cars went like this.


374
0:13:28,86 --> 0:13:30,21
So that didn't really
interject at the right point.


375
0:13:30,21 --> 0:13:35,14
But they did kind
of right at 2008.


376
0:13:35,14 --> 0:13:38,7
Your equipment is
really important too.


377
0:13:38,7 --> 0:13:40,287
Your equipment is
very important.


378
0:13:40,287 --> 0:13:41,62
It's the chicken before the egg.


379
0:13:41,62 --> 0:13:42,32
What is it?


380
0:13:42,32 --> 0:13:42,62
Is it the driver?


381
0:13:42,62 --> 0:13:43,41
Or is it the car?


382
0:13:43,41 --> 0:13:45,493
Well, you really can't
have one without the other.


383
0:13:45,493 --> 0:13:48,37
So if things aren't where
they need to be there


384
0:13:48,37 --> 0:13:50,73
then the best
driver can't take--


385
0:13:50,73 --> 0:13:52,105
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: We kind of


386
0:13:52,105 --> 0:13:53,66
have that with computing power.


387
0:13:53,66 --> 0:13:54,1
DANICA PATRICK: Sure.


388
0:13:54,1 --> 0:13:54,6
Absolutely.


389
0:13:54,6 --> 0:13:56,99
You're only as good
as your resources.


390
0:13:56,99 --> 0:13:58,7
Your technology.


391
0:13:58,7 --> 0:14:1,52
Your coworkers.


392
0:14:1,52 --> 0:14:2,79
Your brainstorming.


393
0:14:2,79 --> 0:14:6,59
Your motherboard?


394
0:14:6,59 --> 0:14:8,87
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
Yeah, exactly.


395
0:14:8,87 --> 0:14:9,395
Your core.


396
0:14:9,395 --> 0:14:10,21
Your chip core.


397
0:14:10,21 --> 0:14:11,353
DANICA PATRICK: Yeah, that's it.


398
0:14:11,353 --> 0:14:12,4
Chip it up.


399
0:14:12,4 --> 0:14:13,11
Chip me up.


400
0:14:13,11 --> 0:14:15,26
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
That's what I'm saying.


401
0:14:15,26 --> 0:14:17,97



402
0:14:17,97 --> 0:14:19,47
Back to the
male-dominated thing.


403
0:14:19,47 --> 0:14:22,37
I have found-- and I think
some of the female engineers,


404
0:14:22,37 --> 0:14:25,16
hopefully some of them are
in the room-- sometimes


405
0:14:25,16 --> 0:14:27,15
the situation is you
don't get the respect.


406
0:14:27,15 --> 0:14:29,33
And you talked a
little bit about that.


407
0:14:29,33 --> 0:14:30,239
And then you earn it.


408
0:14:30,239 --> 0:14:31,78
And maybe it takes
little bit longer.


409
0:14:31,78 --> 0:14:34,37
And the other situation is maybe
you get too much attention.


410
0:14:34,37 --> 0:14:36,32
Where you're just a
person doing a job.


411
0:14:36,32 --> 0:14:38,66
And I think for you it's
probably frustrating.


412
0:14:38,66 --> 0:14:40,56
I mean, you've gotten
a lot of attention.


413
0:14:40,56 --> 0:14:41,81
I think as a driver.


414
0:14:41,81 --> 0:14:44,377
But maybe a little bit more
sometimes as a female race


415
0:14:44,377 --> 0:14:46,21
car-- and particularly
being the first woman


416
0:14:46,21 --> 0:14:47,67
to do some of the things--
we're going to talk about a few


417
0:14:47,67 --> 0:14:48,6
of them as well.


418
0:14:48,6 --> 0:14:48,86
DANICA PATRICK: And
that does happen.


419
0:14:48,86 --> 0:14:50,29
It's a double-edged sword.


420
0:14:50,29 --> 0:14:53,94
When you are different or
outside of the box and people


421
0:14:53,94 --> 0:14:55,25
are paying attention.


422
0:14:55,25 --> 0:14:59,39
You do something good or kind
of good and people realize it.


423
0:14:59,39 --> 0:15:1,7
You do something
bad or kind of bad


424
0:15:1,7 --> 0:15:3,29
and people realize that, too.


425
0:15:3,29 --> 0:15:4,54
So it's a double-edged sword.


426
0:15:4,54 --> 0:15:5,74
But I mean, I'll take it.


427
0:15:5,74 --> 0:15:9,6
Because there's times where
I finished fourth and it


428
0:15:9,6 --> 0:15:11,17
makes big news.


429
0:15:11,17 --> 0:15:13,39
And that doesn't
happen for anyone else.


430
0:15:13,39 --> 0:15:16,6
So they're noticing
the little things


431
0:15:16,6 --> 0:15:18,28
along the way a little bit more.


432
0:15:18,28 --> 0:15:20,8
What happened in my first year.


433
0:15:20,8 --> 0:15:22,25
Or something like that.


434
0:15:22,25 --> 0:15:24,61
Something a little bit
unique about it sticks out.


435
0:15:24,61 --> 0:15:26,64
And because I'm a
girl and I'm different


436
0:15:26,64 --> 0:15:28,39
and these things haven't
been done before.


437
0:15:28,39 --> 0:15:33,57



438
0:15:33,57 --> 0:15:37,7
All I know is that in my
career I just work really hard.


439
0:15:37,7 --> 0:15:41,28
And I know that when I've
done everything possible


440
0:15:41,28 --> 0:15:45,12
on and off the track to
perform, then people's opinions


441
0:15:45,12 --> 0:15:48,34
or judgments can't affect me.


442
0:15:48,34 --> 0:15:50,9
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
When you work hard,


443
0:15:50,9 --> 0:15:51,97
you've got a lot of, I
think, physical conditioning


444
0:15:51,97 --> 0:15:53,11
you probably have to do.


445
0:15:53,11 --> 0:15:55,12
And then, do you just
have to drive a lot?


446
0:15:55,12 --> 0:15:57,9
DANICA PATRICK: For my
physical conditioning?


447
0:15:57,9 --> 0:15:57,43
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: For both.


448
0:15:57,43 --> 0:15:58,79
I mean, how do
you stay in shape?


449
0:15:58,79 --> 0:15:59,34
Danica Patrick: I mean, I
take it to the streets--


450
0:15:59,34 --> 0:16:0,75
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
For driving 200mph.


451
0:16:0,75 --> 0:16:2,73
DANICA PATRICK: In a
calculated fashion.


452
0:16:2,73 --> 0:16:6,9
I do make a lot of
people mad on the road.


453
0:16:6,9 --> 0:16:7,26
I'm sorry about that.


454
0:16:7,26 --> 0:16:8,718
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: I meant more


455
0:16:8,718 --> 0:16:10,57
in a contained environment.


456
0:16:10,57 --> 0:16:12,28
DANICA PATRICK: No I mean I'm--


457
0:16:12,28 --> 0:16:13,1
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: On the track.


458
0:16:13,1 --> 0:16:14,53
Do you go and drive every day?


459
0:16:14,53 --> 0:16:16,8
DANICA PATRICK: There's testing.


460
0:16:16,8 --> 0:16:16,747
Practice.


461
0:16:16,747 --> 0:16:18,8
Or whatever you want to call it.


462
0:16:18,8 --> 0:16:20,52
We call it testing.


463
0:16:20,52 --> 0:16:22,46
This week-- this
Thursday and Friday--


464
0:16:22,46 --> 0:16:24,94
we'll be at Daytona getting
ready for the Daytona 500


465
0:16:24,94 --> 0:16:26,46
at the end of March.


466
0:16:26,46 --> 0:16:27,66
So you do some of that.


467
0:16:27,66 --> 0:16:30,54



468
0:16:30,54 --> 0:16:34,34
The real conditioning
comes in the season when


469
0:16:34,34 --> 0:16:36,93
you get in the car and you get
racing every single weekend.


470
0:16:36,93 --> 0:16:40,84
And we have two weekends
out of-- we have 38 races


471
0:16:40,84 --> 0:16:41,74
and two weekends off.


472
0:16:41,74 --> 0:16:44,59
So we race all year.


473
0:16:44,59 --> 0:16:46,76
I mean it just feels
like we race all year.


474
0:16:46,76 --> 0:16:49,27
And then we get five
minutes off and then


475
0:16:49,27 --> 0:16:51,27
you're right back at it again.


476
0:16:51,27 --> 0:16:54,69
So it goes pretty hard.


477
0:16:54,69 --> 0:16:55,46
For sure.


478
0:16:55,46 --> 0:16:59,54
But do you have to be the
fittest person in the world


479
0:16:59,54 --> 0:17:0,38
to drive a race car?


480
0:17:0,38 --> 0:17:0,88
No.


481
0:17:0,88 --> 0:17:2,13
But you do you have to be fit.


482
0:17:2,13 --> 0:17:5,2
You do have to be race
fit, as we call it.


483
0:17:5,2 --> 0:17:6,68
There's a lot of repetition.


484
0:17:6,68 --> 0:17:7,71
There's a lot of heat.


485
0:17:7,71 --> 0:17:9,81
There's a lot of adrenaline.


486
0:17:9,81 --> 0:17:14,28
And it's about being able to
control all that and keep cool.


487
0:17:14,28 --> 0:17:16,349
And literally keep cool.


488
0:17:16,349 --> 0:17:17,65
And keep cool in your head.


489
0:17:17,65 --> 0:17:20,48
And not grip the wheel so hard.


490
0:17:20,48 --> 0:17:24,442
And be conditioned for
the repetition, too.


491
0:17:24,442 --> 0:17:26,15
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
And the repetition


492
0:17:26,15 --> 0:17:27,56
meaning-- because you
don't want to zone out.


493
0:17:27,56 --> 0:17:28,518
Cause you got to keep--


494
0:17:28,518 --> 0:17:33,6
DANICA PATRICK: Well, it's
this and this and this and this


495
0:17:33,6 --> 0:17:37,817
and this--- so it's when the
car is not balanced right.


496
0:17:37,817 --> 0:17:39,65
It's not just a matter
of turning the wheel.


497
0:17:39,65 --> 0:17:40,85
It's a matter of
turning the wheel


498
0:17:40,85 --> 0:17:42,13
and feeling what it's doing.


499
0:17:42,13 --> 0:17:44,81
And catching it all the
way around the corner.


500
0:17:44,81 --> 0:17:48,87
So you're tensed
up the whole time.


501
0:17:48,87 --> 0:17:50,68
And then even down
the straightaway


502
0:17:50,68 --> 0:17:51,99
the car wants to turn left.


503
0:17:51,99 --> 0:17:52,94
It has stagger.


504
0:17:52,94 --> 0:17:54,99
It wants to turn left.


505
0:17:54,99 --> 0:17:57,3
So you still have to hold
it down the straightaway.


506
0:17:57,3 --> 0:18:1,17
But in the corner you
release and let it in.


507
0:18:1,17 --> 0:18:4,99
And then you're just chasing
it through the corner.


508
0:18:4,99 --> 0:18:7,99
Or you're adding a whole bunch
of wheel because it won't turn


509
0:18:7,99 --> 0:18:10,48
and then your shoulder
gets an impingement.


510
0:18:10,48 --> 0:18:12,94
And that's not good either.


511
0:18:12,94 --> 0:18:13,48
I know.


512
0:18:13,48 --> 0:18:14,77
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: And by
the way, speaking of the heat,


513
0:18:14,77 --> 0:18:16,887
I'm all worried because
the room is a little warm.


514
0:18:16,887 --> 0:18:17,97
She's looking at me like--


515
0:18:17,97 --> 0:18:21,68
DANICA PATRICK: No,
those cars are probably


516
0:18:21,68 --> 0:18:25,307
130 degrees inside
the whole time.


517
0:18:25,307 --> 0:18:27,14
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
So you must sweat off


518
0:18:27,14 --> 0:18:28,42
10 pounds riding it.


519
0:18:28,42 --> 0:18:29,92
DANICA PATRICK:
It's really awesome.


520
0:18:29,92 --> 0:18:31,6



521
0:18:31,6 --> 0:18:34,46
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: But
then you eat one Big Mac.


522
0:18:34,46 --> 0:18:35,98
DANICA PATRICK:
Before we started,


523
0:18:35,98 --> 0:18:40,45
we were just talking about
holidays and being in shape.


524
0:18:40,45 --> 0:18:44,0
And I said that by nature
that my job is athletic.


525
0:18:44,0 --> 0:18:48,9
And if not, I just sweat it off.


526
0:18:48,9 --> 0:18:51,2
By the end of the season I'm
always my fittest and leanest.


527
0:18:51,2 --> 0:18:55,35
Because every weekend
you're in the car three days


528
0:18:55,35 --> 0:18:56,8
a week minimum.


529
0:18:56,8 --> 0:18:57,33
I was in the car.


530
0:18:57,33 --> 0:19:1,44
I tested on average every
other week for two days.


531
0:19:1,44 --> 0:19:3,21
Every other week, I
would say, on average.


532
0:19:3,21 --> 0:19:7,19
So I'm in the car almost five
days a week most of the time.


533
0:19:7,19 --> 0:19:8,96
And then the races
are four hours long.


534
0:19:8,96 --> 0:19:12,4
So the pit stop isn't
like a pit stop down


535
0:19:12,4 --> 0:19:16,62
the road for a candy
bar and an energy drink.


536
0:19:16,62 --> 0:19:17,52
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: No smoothie.


537
0:19:17,52 --> 0:19:18,8
No Starbucks.


538
0:19:18,8 --> 0:19:21,28
DANICA PATRICK: I do drink
something with calories


539
0:19:21,28 --> 0:19:21,864
but it's not--


540
0:19:21,864 --> 0:19:24,238
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Like
those gel things or whatever?


541
0:19:24,238 --> 0:19:27,9
DANICA PATRICK: No, it's
like a premix shake stuff.


542
0:19:27,9 --> 0:19:31,424
But it's by no means a meal.


543
0:19:31,424 --> 0:19:32,965
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
Well, speaking


544
0:19:32,965 --> 0:19:35,756
of doing a ton of
racing, we we wanted


545
0:19:35,756 --> 0:19:36,88
to show a video-- Oh, look.


546
0:19:36,88 --> 0:19:40,79
And there you are
winning, as you win a lot.


547
0:19:40,79 --> 0:19:44,12
But one of the videos
we wanted to show--


548
0:19:44,12 --> 0:19:45,8
it's kind of a long
video guys, but it


549
0:19:45,8 --> 0:19:48,642
was an exciting, historic
event which was-- she's


550
0:19:48,642 --> 0:19:50,35
the first woman to
win the pole position.


551
0:19:50,35 --> 0:19:52,71
And this is at the Daytona 500.


552
0:19:52,71 --> 0:19:55,722
So we're going to watch that
video for a couple minutes


553
0:19:55,722 --> 0:19:56,93
and then we'll talk about it.


554
0:19:56,93 --> 0:20:5,74



555
0:20:5,74 --> 0:20:9,76
DANICA PATRICK: That happens
the week before the race.


556
0:20:9,76 --> 0:20:13,42
So when's the race?


557
0:20:13,42 --> 0:20:15,97
The Daytona 500 is usually
the third or fourth.


558
0:20:15,97 --> 0:20:17,98
February 23 this year?


559
0:20:17,98 --> 0:20:20,5
So it'll be the week
before that on Saturday.


560
0:20:20,5 --> 0:20:20,665
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: All right.


561
0:20:20,665 --> 0:20:21,748
So in about a month or so.


562
0:20:21,748 --> 0:20:23,97



563
0:20:23,97 --> 0:20:25,22
You're just doing a job there.


564
0:20:25,22 --> 0:20:28,2
But are you thinking, I'm
making history right now?


565
0:20:28,2 --> 0:20:31,9
Are you thinking, I just
need to get pole position?


566
0:20:31,9 --> 0:20:31,74
What was your--


567
0:20:31,74 --> 0:20:34,323
DANICA PATRICK: I mean, I'm just
thinking about taking the car


568
0:20:34,323 --> 0:20:37,67
and taking it to
its potential level.


569
0:20:37,67 --> 0:20:41,205
And not wasting its potential
by making a little mistake


570
0:20:41,205 --> 0:20:42,89
and missing a shift.


571
0:20:42,89 --> 0:20:43,96
Getting up to speed.


572
0:20:43,96 --> 0:20:47,5
Or clipping the apron when
you're going around the corner.


573
0:20:47,5 --> 0:20:49,61
Because the car doesn't
just go just dead straight.


574
0:20:49,61 --> 0:20:52,54
It kind of follows the road.


575
0:20:52,54 --> 0:20:53,54
And it pulls.


576
0:20:53,54 --> 0:20:55,97
And it moves.


577
0:20:55,97 --> 0:20:57,96
So it's not hard.


578
0:20:57,96 --> 0:21:0,56
Daytona's not the hardest
track at all to drive.


579
0:21:0,56 --> 0:21:3,726
But just the little things.


580
0:21:3,726 --> 0:21:5,92
I'm not going to be able
to take the car at Daytona


581
0:21:5,92 --> 0:21:10,65
and take it from a 15th
place car to a pole car.


582
0:21:10,65 --> 0:21:13,52
But I can screw it up and
lose the pole for sure


583
0:21:13,52 --> 0:21:15,46
by making little
mistakes on the track.


584
0:21:15,46 --> 0:21:17,12
By not getting up
to speed right.


585
0:21:17,12 --> 0:21:18,8
Not taking the right line.


586
0:21:18,8 --> 0:21:21,35
As in, letting the car
open up and pick up speed.


587
0:21:21,35 --> 0:21:23,7
Because every time
you hold wheel on it,


588
0:21:23,7 --> 0:21:25,144
it's going to scrub
speed and slow it down.


589
0:21:25,144 --> 0:21:26,81
But you also want the
shortest distance.


590
0:21:26,81 --> 0:21:29,12
So there's a little
marriage between letting


591
0:21:29,12 --> 0:21:31,6
it open up off the corner
to build up momentum,


592
0:21:31,6 --> 0:21:33,58
but also running
a short distance


593
0:21:33,58 --> 0:21:35,83
so that you're not adding
feet onto your lap.


594
0:21:35,83 --> 0:21:36,97
Making a longer lap.


595
0:21:36,97 --> 0:21:39,4
So just little things like that.


596
0:21:39,4 --> 0:21:40,254
And catching the apron.


597
0:21:40,254 --> 0:21:42,42
You're trying to be as low
as you can on the corner.


598
0:21:42,42 --> 0:21:45,8
But the track has
a transition point.


599
0:21:45,8 --> 0:21:48,24
And at that transition point,
if the car bottoms out,


600
0:21:48,24 --> 0:21:50,89
the body work will hit it
and scrub a bunch of speed


601
0:21:50,89 --> 0:21:51,43
off the car.


602
0:21:51,43 --> 0:21:53,26
So just little things like that.


603
0:21:53,26 --> 0:21:55,1
But I'm not really
thinking about history.


604
0:21:55,1 --> 0:21:56,1
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
Basically your answer is


605
0:21:56,1 --> 0:21:57,17
you're doing your job.


606
0:21:57,17 --> 0:21:58,641
DANICA PATRICK: Yeah,
I'm doing my job.


607
0:21:58,641 --> 0:21:59,18
Absolutely.


608
0:21:59,18 --> 0:21:59,465
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
You're looking


609
0:21:59,465 --> 0:22:0,33
to win is what you're doing.


610
0:22:0,33 --> 0:22:1,62
DANICA PATRICK: Yes, exactly.


611
0:22:1,62 --> 0:22:4,492
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
That's a good answer.


612
0:22:4,492 --> 0:22:5,95
DANICA PATRICK:
Watching qualifying


613
0:22:5,95 --> 0:22:8,65
is painful as a driver.


614
0:22:8,65 --> 0:22:10,934
After you go there's
literally nothing else


615
0:22:10,934 --> 0:22:12,35
that you can do
to make it better.


616
0:22:12,35 --> 0:22:13,35
It could only get worse.


617
0:22:13,35 --> 0:22:15,683
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: And
you need to hang around there


618
0:22:15,683 --> 0:22:16,44
and watch it, or?


619
0:22:16,44 --> 0:22:19,6
DANICA PATRICK: I went
and worked out actually.


620
0:22:19,6 --> 0:22:20,81
I was like, what do I do?


621
0:22:20,81 --> 0:22:25,48
And I just I went
back to the bus,


622
0:22:25,48 --> 0:22:27,72
got my gym clothes on,
and went into the gym


623
0:22:27,72 --> 0:22:30,94
and worked out and
watched qualifying.


624
0:22:30,94 --> 0:22:33,74
I was still in the gym when
the last cars were qualifying.


625
0:22:33,74 --> 0:22:37,3
And my PR people kept
coming in and saying,


626
0:22:37,3 --> 0:22:38,35
you need to get ready.


627
0:22:38,35 --> 0:22:39,31
You need to get ready.


628
0:22:39,31 --> 0:22:40,2
You're going to be on pole.


629
0:22:40,2 --> 0:22:42,9
I'm like, I'm not getting
out of these clothes


630
0:22:42,9 --> 0:22:44,16
until I see that
car pass the line


631
0:22:44,16 --> 0:22:45,285
and I know I'm on the pole.


632
0:22:45,285 --> 0:22:46,95
Because I'm not jinxing this.


633
0:22:46,95 --> 0:22:48,45
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: Good for you.


634
0:22:48,45 --> 0:22:50,39
DANICA PATRICK: I
forgot to eat then, too.


635
0:22:50,39 --> 0:22:54,73
So me with no food is no good.


636
0:22:54,73 --> 0:22:55,54
It's no good.


637
0:22:55,54 --> 0:22:58,34
Any girls in here
that feel me on that?


638
0:22:58,34 --> 0:23:1,394
Seems to be more
of a girl issue.


639
0:23:1,394 --> 0:23:3,56
So I didn't eat lunch because
I went and worked out.


640
0:23:3,56 --> 0:23:6,143
And then I had to go do all the
interviews for hours and hours


641
0:23:6,143 --> 0:23:8,79
afterwards.


642
0:23:8,79 --> 0:23:10,5
I probably kept Brian
Williams waiting,


643
0:23:10,5 --> 0:23:14,13
but I had to eat a sandwich
at some point in time.


644
0:23:14,13 --> 0:23:15,14
But it was exciting.


645
0:23:15,14 --> 0:23:16,12
It was a lot of fun.


646
0:23:16,12 --> 0:23:18,1
And it was really
neat to see number


647
0:23:18,1 --> 0:23:19,69
10 at the top of the boards.


648
0:23:19,69 --> 0:23:21,87
And it's cool just to have
number 10 back really.


649
0:23:21,87 --> 0:23:24,93
Because it was my go-kart
number, as you guys saw.


650
0:23:24,93 --> 0:23:26,73
So I got to choose that number.


651
0:23:26,73 --> 0:23:28,74
So it's really neat to
have my old number back.


652
0:23:28,74 --> 0:23:29,92
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
When you went to NASCAR


653
0:23:29,92 --> 0:23:30,49
you got to choose?


654
0:23:30,49 --> 0:23:33,2
DANICA PATRICK: When I went to
Stewart-Haas Racing and Sprint


655
0:23:33,2 --> 0:23:34,64
Cup I got to choose my number.


656
0:23:34,64 --> 0:23:35,33
Yeah.


657
0:23:35,33 --> 0:23:37,91
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: That's great.


658
0:23:37,91 --> 0:23:39,51
That's a factoid for us.


659
0:23:39,51 --> 0:23:40,28
That's good.


660
0:23:40,28 --> 0:23:43,13
So you are one of
the only 13 drivers


661
0:23:43,13 --> 0:23:45,571
who has led laps in both the
Indy 500 and the Daytona 500.


662
0:23:45,571 --> 0:23:47,32
DANICA PATRICK: So I
think that's probably


663
0:23:47,32 --> 0:23:48,72
the coolest statistic to me.


664
0:23:48,72 --> 0:23:49,928
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Is it?


665
0:23:49,928 --> 0:23:51,3
I wanted to ask you about.


666
0:23:51,3 --> 0:23:53,64
Is that-- again remembering
I don't know that


667
0:23:53,64 --> 0:23:56,7
much about race car driving--
so is that just totally


668
0:23:56,7 --> 0:23:57,89
different kinds of racing?


669
0:23:57,89 --> 0:24:0,44
And to be at the top of
your game in both of them


670
0:24:0,44 --> 0:24:1,38
is pretty amazing?


671
0:24:1,38 --> 0:24:2,91
DANICA PATRICK: I mean, they
both have the same elements.


672
0:24:2,91 --> 0:24:5,26
But they're just newly
learned disciplines.


673
0:24:5,26 --> 0:24:7,7
So I don't know
how to relate it.


674
0:24:7,7 --> 0:24:9,435
It's like a whole
new computer system.


675
0:24:9,435 --> 0:24:10,31
It's like, all right.


676
0:24:10,31 --> 0:24:11,83
I need to figure this out.


677
0:24:11,83 --> 0:24:12,32
But it's all the same--


678
0:24:12,32 --> 0:24:13,44
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
Different programming language.


679
0:24:13,44 --> 0:24:13,76
DANICA PATRICK: --sort of ideas.


680
0:24:13,76 --> 0:24:16,51
It's just trying to figure
it out all over again.


681
0:24:16,51 --> 0:24:17,26
And you'll get it.


682
0:24:17,26 --> 0:24:18,885
But it just takes a
little bit of time.


683
0:24:18,885 --> 0:24:20,39
And so it's the same thing.


684
0:24:20,39 --> 0:24:22,25
So, yeah.


685
0:24:22,25 --> 0:24:23,91
I thought that's the
coolest statistic.


686
0:24:23,91 --> 0:24:26,64
To be one of 13
drivers in history


687
0:24:26,64 --> 0:24:28,459
that have led Daytona and Indy.


688
0:24:28,459 --> 0:24:29,25
That's pretty neat.


689
0:24:29,25 --> 0:24:30,65
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: And
why are those two races


690
0:24:30,65 --> 0:24:31,37
such a big deal?


691
0:24:31,37 --> 0:24:31,95
I mean as you said--


692
0:24:31,95 --> 0:24:32,12
DANICA PATRICK:
They're the oldest.


693
0:24:32,12 --> 0:24:32,89
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
--the Daytona track--


694
0:24:32,89 --> 0:24:33,985
DANICA PATRICK: They're
some of the oldest.


695
0:24:33,985 --> 0:24:34,47
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: The oldest.


696
0:24:34,47 --> 0:24:34,979
Got it.


697
0:24:34,979 --> 0:24:36,77
DANICA PATRICK: Indy's
about 100 years old.


698
0:24:36,77 --> 0:24:38,322
And Daytona's
about 50 years old.


699
0:24:38,322 --> 0:24:40,53
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: And
they get great TV coverage


700
0:24:40,53 --> 0:24:40,95
and all that stuff.


701
0:24:40,95 --> 0:24:41,47
DANICA PATRICK: They do.


702
0:24:41,47 --> 0:24:42,97
There's a lot that
goes around them.


703
0:24:42,97 --> 0:24:45,54
Qualifying is the weekend
before for both of them.


704
0:24:45,54 --> 0:24:46,802
So qualifying happens.


705
0:24:46,802 --> 0:24:48,26
There's a lot of
media around that.


706
0:24:48,26 --> 0:24:50,81
And then it goes all
the way through the week


707
0:24:50,81 --> 0:24:53,21
into the race weekend.


708
0:24:53,21 --> 0:24:53,71
Yeah.


709
0:24:53,71 --> 0:24:56,43
They generally have
a culture of fun.


710
0:24:56,43 --> 0:24:59,6
I mean, there's a
lot of campsites.


711
0:24:59,6 --> 0:25:0,41
And people that hang out.


712
0:25:0,41 --> 0:25:1,87
And bonfire.


713
0:25:1,87 --> 0:25:3,47
And set up tiki bars.


714
0:25:3,47 --> 0:25:5,15
And play cornhole.


715
0:25:5,15 --> 0:25:8,7
And fly their Dale Jr flags.


716
0:25:8,7 --> 0:25:10,77
And some of them
have Danica flags.


717
0:25:10,77 --> 0:25:13,103
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: We
need to get more Danica flags.


718
0:25:13,103 --> 0:25:15,297
So let's talk a little
bit about things


719
0:25:15,297 --> 0:25:16,63
that are related to what you do.


720
0:25:16,63 --> 0:25:17,32
Teamwork.


721
0:25:17,32 --> 0:25:18,52
Advice you might have.


722
0:25:18,52 --> 0:25:19,85
Dealing with criticism.


723
0:25:19,85 --> 0:25:20,97
And one of things you've
already talked about--


724
0:25:20,97 --> 0:25:22,47
and I think people
here might relate


725
0:25:22,47 --> 0:25:24,761
is-- sometimes it feels like
you've got this repetitive


726
0:25:24,761 --> 0:25:26,5
stuff and you've
got to stay focused.


727
0:25:26,5 --> 0:25:30,35
And you're also dealing with a
lot of scrutiny, as you said.


728
0:25:30,35 --> 0:25:32,21
Maybe a little bit
more being a woman.


729
0:25:32,21 --> 0:25:34,42
What advice would
you have to people


730
0:25:34,42 --> 0:25:35,6
who are facing obstacles?


731
0:25:35,6 --> 0:25:38,7
Who need to maintain their
focus and their confidence.


732
0:25:38,7 --> 0:25:40,11
Even when day in
and day out they


733
0:25:40,11 --> 0:25:42,8
may not be getting
the rewards that they


734
0:25:42,8 --> 0:25:44,627
are hoping to get for
their work product.


735
0:25:44,627 --> 0:25:47,21
DANICA PATRICK: I mean, I think
the difference between someone


736
0:25:47,21 --> 0:25:51,48
who ultimately is successful
and someone who isn't, is just


737
0:25:51,48 --> 0:25:53,5
getting up and trying again.


738
0:25:53,5 --> 0:25:55,97
And I feel like I've
seen that in my life--


739
0:25:55,97 --> 0:25:59,79
again, to other people--
is that things get hard


740
0:25:59,79 --> 0:26:1,21
and people try again.


741
0:26:1,21 --> 0:26:4,23
And things got hard and people
might try again, might not.


742
0:26:4,23 --> 0:26:6,58
And then things got hard and
they just don't try again.


743
0:26:6,58 --> 0:26:10,89
And giving up
can't be an option.


744
0:26:10,89 --> 0:26:14,115
And I think that goes back
to the core of making sure


745
0:26:14,115 --> 0:26:15,99
that whatever it is
you're doing is something


746
0:26:15,99 --> 0:26:17,54
that you love to do.


747
0:26:17,54 --> 0:26:18,74
Something that you enjoy.


748
0:26:18,74 --> 0:26:21,74
Something that maybe if
you didn't even get paid,


749
0:26:21,74 --> 0:26:23,5
would you still do it?


750
0:26:23,5 --> 0:26:26,28
And I think that's what
pulls you through those times


751
0:26:26,28 --> 0:26:28,272
ultimately.


752
0:26:28,272 --> 0:26:30,23
And that's what keeps
you coming back for more.


753
0:26:30,23 --> 0:26:32,67
And that's what that
passion and that love


754
0:26:32,67 --> 0:26:35,542
for what it is that you do
is what keeps you going.


755
0:26:35,542 --> 0:26:37,0
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: So would you


756
0:26:37,0 --> 0:26:40,9
say your resilience
and that persistence


757
0:26:40,9 --> 0:26:41,96
is because you love
what you do so much?


758
0:26:41,96 --> 0:26:43,668
Or is there something
about your parents?


759
0:26:43,668 --> 0:26:45,95
Or anything in your upbringing?


760
0:26:45,95 --> 0:26:48,42
DANICA PATRICK: I
think that genetically


761
0:26:48,42 --> 0:26:50,27
I'm determined
because my dad was


762
0:26:50,27 --> 0:26:51,85
very much like that for sure.


763
0:26:51,85 --> 0:26:54,41
Very persistent and determined.


764
0:26:54,41 --> 0:26:56,5
But I think it's also
because I found something


765
0:26:56,5 --> 0:26:57,62
that I love to do.


766
0:26:57,62 --> 0:27:0,8
And there's plenty
of other stuff


767
0:27:0,8 --> 0:27:2,41
that I've done that
I didn't keep doing.


768
0:27:2,41 --> 0:27:4,36
I mean, I didn't keep
playing basketball.


769
0:27:4,36 --> 0:27:6,3
Let's face it.


770
0:27:6,3 --> 0:27:8,77
But I kept racing.


771
0:27:8,77 --> 0:27:10,88
So it was about finding that.


772
0:27:10,88 --> 0:27:11,85
I feel.


773
0:27:11,85 --> 0:27:13,21
And finding it really young.


774
0:27:13,21 --> 0:27:15,85
I'm very fortunate that
I found it really young.


775
0:27:15,85 --> 0:27:19,13
And I tell everyone,
young or old,


776
0:27:19,13 --> 0:27:22,28
if you could do anything in
the world, what would you do?


777
0:27:22,28 --> 0:27:24,35
Well, why can't
you do that, then?


778
0:27:24,35 --> 0:27:25,32
At least start.


779
0:27:25,32 --> 0:27:28,27
At least just try to make
an effort at doing it.


780
0:27:28,27 --> 0:27:30,19
You're not going to get
there within one shot.


781
0:27:30,19 --> 0:27:32,37
But you just need
to take baby steps.


782
0:27:32,37 --> 0:27:33,71
And opportunities along the way.


783
0:27:33,71 --> 0:27:35,46
And I feel like, especially
people get out of college


784
0:27:35,46 --> 0:27:36,94
and they have this idea
of what they want to do


785
0:27:36,94 --> 0:27:38,606
and their holding out
until they get it.


786
0:27:38,606 --> 0:27:39,84
Just get going.


787
0:27:39,84 --> 0:27:41,16
Just get working.


788
0:27:41,16 --> 0:27:42,44
And get the experience.


789
0:27:42,44 --> 0:27:45,765
And start working
your way there.


790
0:27:45,765 --> 0:27:47,89
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: I
think that's great advice.


791
0:27:47,89 --> 0:27:51,13
So you said what makes you
different makes you great.


792
0:27:51,13 --> 0:27:53,511
Where does that
advice come from?


793
0:27:53,511 --> 0:27:54,51
When you talk to people.


794
0:27:54,51 --> 0:27:56,1
DANICA PATRICK:
Well, I mean I think


795
0:27:56,1 --> 0:27:58,9
that the most obvious
one, really obviously,


796
0:27:58,9 --> 0:27:59,53
is being a girl.


797
0:27:59,53 --> 0:28:2,29
So when I was
younger, and living


798
0:28:2,29 --> 0:28:7,86
in England and
early teen years, I


799
0:28:7,86 --> 0:28:9,13
didn't care that I was a girl.


800
0:28:9,13 --> 0:28:10,921
I just didn't want to
make it real obvious.


801
0:28:10,921 --> 0:28:13,33
I mean, I didn't
want it to stand out.


802
0:28:13,33 --> 0:28:15,57
I didn't wear nail
polish because when


803
0:28:15,57 --> 0:28:17,75
I talk about the race
car I didn't want guys


804
0:28:17,75 --> 0:28:20,76
looking at my hands and
seeing pink fingernails.


805
0:28:20,76 --> 0:28:23,54
I didn't wear pink
and purple and make


806
0:28:23,54 --> 0:28:26,24
it really flashy and obvious.


807
0:28:26,24 --> 0:28:27,5
No hearts and bows.


808
0:28:27,5 --> 0:28:28,884
And just wanted to blend in.


809
0:28:28,884 --> 0:28:30,55
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
You're describing


810
0:28:30,55 --> 0:28:31,674
my seven-year-old daughter.


811
0:28:31,674 --> 0:28:32,87
DANICA PATRICK: Am I really?


812
0:28:32,87 --> 0:28:33,36
Hearts and bows?


813
0:28:33,36 --> 0:28:34,42
Or didn't want to
wear hearts and bows?


814
0:28:34,42 --> 0:28:35,36
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
She's now rejecting them.


815
0:28:35,36 --> 0:28:37,62
But she was all in them.


816
0:28:37,62 --> 0:28:39,52
DANICA PATRICK: Well, you go
through these phases where you


817
0:28:39,52 --> 0:28:40,57
feel comfortable and
sometimes you don't.


818
0:28:40,57 --> 0:28:43,11
And I didn't really feel
comfortable making it obvious.


819
0:28:43,11 --> 0:28:47,23
And so it really was--
I came back from England


820
0:28:47,23 --> 0:28:49,85
when I was 19.


821
0:28:49,85 --> 0:28:54,68
And I let myself go there
to be a girl a little bit.


822
0:28:54,68 --> 0:28:58,63
And it really came
from a racy photo shoot


823
0:28:58,63 --> 0:29:1,8
that I did that it
was more girly of me.


824
0:29:1,8 --> 0:29:3,96
And it just all of a sudden--
stuff started happening.


825
0:29:3,96 --> 0:29:6,49
And people were contacting me.


826
0:29:6,49 --> 0:29:8,77
And sponsors and teams.


827
0:29:8,77 --> 0:29:10,65
But nobody questioned
what I could do.


828
0:29:10,65 --> 0:29:13,25
It wasn't like people
didn't think I could race.


829
0:29:13,25 --> 0:29:15,9
Or their opinion
really changed on that.


830
0:29:15,9 --> 0:29:16,756
Maybe they had an
opinion on what I did.


831
0:29:16,756 --> 0:29:18,519
But it didn't change
the opportunity


832
0:29:18,519 --> 0:29:20,6
to be able to do
what I wanted to do.


833
0:29:20,6 --> 0:29:23,47
It just really was
opening doors and it


834
0:29:23,47 --> 0:29:26,49
was allowing-- it was me being
able to tap into something


835
0:29:26,49 --> 0:29:28,45
that was part of my personality.


836
0:29:28,45 --> 0:29:31,8
I mean, I think we're not
one-dimensional people.


837
0:29:31,8 --> 0:29:33,98
We have all kinds of
different sides to us.


838
0:29:33,98 --> 0:29:34,99
I don't just race.


839
0:29:34,99 --> 0:29:37,19
I don't just work on cars.


840
0:29:37,19 --> 0:29:37,88
I race.


841
0:29:37,88 --> 0:29:38,85
And I like to cook.


842
0:29:38,85 --> 0:29:40,0
And I like to travel.


843
0:29:40,0 --> 0:29:41,14
And I like to look pretty.


844
0:29:41,14 --> 0:29:42,746
And I like to get dressed up.


845
0:29:42,746 --> 0:29:43,87
And I like hair and makeup.


846
0:29:43,87 --> 0:29:45,286
And I like all
those other things.


847
0:29:45,286 --> 0:29:49,49
So it was a way for me to--
it was an extension of me.


848
0:29:49,49 --> 0:29:50,706
But it was celebrated.


849
0:29:50,706 --> 0:29:52,8
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: So success


850
0:29:52,8 --> 0:29:53,6
came to you as you
embraced who you were.


851
0:29:53,6 --> 0:29:54,6
DANICA PATRICK: Exactly.


852
0:29:54,6 --> 0:29:58,189
So, sometimes, I really
feel that whatever


853
0:29:58,189 --> 0:29:59,73
it is that's the
most different about


854
0:29:59,73 --> 0:30:1,225
you is probably
the most important.


855
0:30:1,225 --> 0:30:2,1
And the most special.


856
0:30:2,1 --> 0:30:2,934
And the most useful.


857
0:30:2,934 --> 0:30:4,308
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: I once had


858
0:30:4,308 --> 0:30:6,15
a boss who-- we
worked in consulting


859
0:30:6,15 --> 0:30:8,25
and we'd go and talk to
clients and I was usually


860
0:30:8,25 --> 0:30:9,57
the only woman in the room.


861
0:30:9,57 --> 0:30:11,6
And he said, whenever
you say something,


862
0:30:11,6 --> 0:30:13,2
everyone is going
to be listening.


863
0:30:13,2 --> 0:30:15,353
Because you're different than
everyone else in the room.


864
0:30:15,353 --> 0:30:17,35
And I was like, yeah.


865
0:30:17,35 --> 0:30:19,39
And I think you're
right on there.


866
0:30:19,39 --> 0:30:20,812
I like it.


867
0:30:20,812 --> 0:30:22,2
So let's talk about the team.


868
0:30:22,2 --> 0:30:22,87
You mentioned this a little bit.


869
0:30:22,87 --> 0:30:24,453
You've got a whole
team you work with.


870
0:30:24,453 --> 0:30:28,22
You've also got the car and
the technology of the car.


871
0:30:28,22 --> 0:30:30,6
How important is that
team for your success?


872
0:30:30,6 --> 0:30:31,85
And how do you work with them?


873
0:30:31,85 --> 0:30:34,525
What's your role in the team?


874
0:30:34,525 --> 0:30:36,4
DANICA PATRICK: I mean,
the team is critical.


875
0:30:36,4 --> 0:30:36,9
Obviously.


876
0:30:36,9 --> 0:30:38,805
I mean, you need a bus driver.


877
0:30:38,805 --> 0:30:40,93
You got to get a truck
driver to get the car there.


878
0:30:40,93 --> 0:30:43,64
You've got to get guys to
put the tires on, of course.


879
0:30:43,64 --> 0:30:46,1
So there's a whole bunch
of steps in the process.


880
0:30:46,1 --> 0:30:47,72
And it can't happen
without the other.


881
0:30:47,72 --> 0:30:49,97
But I think more importantly
with team, for me,


882
0:30:49,97 --> 0:30:52,19
is about morale.


883
0:30:52,19 --> 0:30:53,81
It's about attitude.


884
0:30:53,81 --> 0:30:59,64
It's about your mood and
keeping everyone in a good mood.


885
0:30:59,64 --> 0:31:0,73
All those guys that
you see right there,


886
0:31:0,73 --> 0:31:4,7
we see each other every
weekend of the year.


887
0:31:4,7 --> 0:31:4,62
Pretty much.


888
0:31:4,62 --> 0:31:7,4
And so that can wear on you.


889
0:31:7,4 --> 0:31:8,44
And it can get exhausting.


890
0:31:8,44 --> 0:31:9,75
That's the family vacation.


891
0:31:9,75 --> 0:31:10,9
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
There's your family.


892
0:31:10,9 --> 0:31:11,12
But you had that whole team
of guys behind the car.


893
0:31:11,12 --> 0:31:11,43
DANICA PATRICK: Yeah.


894
0:31:11,43 --> 0:31:13,18
So that's my crew
chief on the left.


895
0:31:13,18 --> 0:31:15,76
He's kind of the other
co-team leader with me.


896
0:31:15,76 --> 0:31:19,53
But the two of us dictate
the mood of the entire team.


897
0:31:19,53 --> 0:31:22,66



898
0:31:22,66 --> 0:31:25,14
Being a leader is also
being a cheerleader.


899
0:31:25,14 --> 0:31:27,41
And it's very important.


900
0:31:27,41 --> 0:31:30,677
So I think that team
is a lot attitude.


901
0:31:30,677 --> 0:31:33,26
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: And then
is your family with you a lot?


902
0:31:33,26 --> 0:31:34,51
We saw them all on the plane.


903
0:31:34,51 --> 0:31:35,635
DANICA PATRICK: Yeah, yeah.


904
0:31:35,635 --> 0:31:37,93
That was the day after
the season ended.


905
0:31:37,93 --> 0:31:39,21
We went on vacation.


906
0:31:39,21 --> 0:31:40,75
So that's Ricky's family.


907
0:31:40,75 --> 0:31:41,897
And my family.


908
0:31:41,897 --> 0:31:43,48
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
Did they go out


909
0:31:43,48 --> 0:31:45,47
for all those 38 weekends?


910
0:31:45,47 --> 0:31:48,5
DANICA PATRICK: They go out
for-- between the two families,


911
0:31:48,5 --> 0:31:49,7
we see them quite a bit.


912
0:31:49,7 --> 0:31:51,38
And we have two buses.


913
0:31:51,38 --> 0:31:54,53
So our family will
stay on my bus


914
0:31:54,53 --> 0:31:55,95
or his family will
stay on my bus.


915
0:31:55,95 --> 0:31:57,22
And we'll stay on Ricky's bus.


916
0:31:57,22 --> 0:32:0,1
And we have a total
fancy campground.


917
0:32:0,1 --> 0:32:1,84
We just open our
buses up together.


918
0:32:1,84 --> 0:32:2,6
Open up the tents.


919
0:32:2,6 --> 0:32:5,53
We've got picnic tables.


920
0:32:5,53 --> 0:32:6,22
Grills.


921
0:32:6,22 --> 0:32:8,4
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
You're making me want a bus.


922
0:32:8,4 --> 0:32:10,149
DANICA PATRICK: Family's
really important.


923
0:32:10,149 --> 0:32:12,59
And I think that as an
extension of your mood,


924
0:32:12,59 --> 0:32:14,61
family plays a role in that too.


925
0:32:14,61 --> 0:32:18,24
If your home life isn't good
that tends to bleed over.


926
0:32:18,24 --> 0:32:20,5
And vice versa.


927
0:32:20,5 --> 0:32:22,59
So keeping everything
in order and being happy


928
0:32:22,59 --> 0:32:25,3
is really important,
I think, for success.


929
0:32:25,3 --> 0:32:27,3
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
You talked a little bit--


930
0:32:27,3 --> 0:32:29,39
I think that's great and it
seems like having that support


931
0:32:29,39 --> 0:32:29,88
system--


932
0:32:29,88 --> 0:32:31,3
DANICA PATRICK: I think I
gotta cheer for the Colts.


933
0:32:31,3 --> 0:32:32,5
We were at a Colts game.


934
0:32:32,5 --> 0:32:34,39
I mean, I'm a Bears fan.


935
0:32:34,39 --> 0:32:37,2
But I don't know anymore.


936
0:32:37,2 --> 0:32:40,17
We haven't been doing so well.


937
0:32:40,17 --> 0:32:41,36
The Colts are on their way.


938
0:32:41,36 --> 0:32:42,94
Did anyone see them come back?


939
0:32:42,94 --> 0:32:43,63
28 points.


940
0:32:43,63 --> 0:32:44,925
Down a half.


941
0:32:44,925 --> 0:32:46,5
That was pretty impressive.


942
0:32:46,5 --> 0:32:48,258
I don't know if they'd beat
a California team or not.


943
0:32:48,258 --> 0:32:49,32
But I'm sorry but--


944
0:32:49,32 --> 0:32:50,76
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: We
have to get off this topic.


945
0:32:50,76 --> 0:32:52,26
DANICA PATRICK: But
I did watch the game.


946
0:32:52,26 --> 0:32:53,26
But I'm still a girl.


947
0:32:53,26 --> 0:32:55,9
I still don't always remember
all the details about it.


948
0:32:55,9 --> 0:32:57,65
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
Me either, but I like it.


949
0:32:57,65 --> 0:32:57,49
DANICA PATRICK: I do too.


950
0:32:57,49 --> 0:32:57,95
I love football.


951
0:32:57,95 --> 0:32:58,74
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
I love football.


952
0:32:58,74 --> 0:32:59,24
All right.


953
0:32:59,24 --> 0:33:1,51
So talking about-- not
related to the NFL--


954
0:33:1,51 --> 0:33:4,59
DANICA PATRICK: Anybody watch
the GoDaddy Bowl last night?


955
0:33:4,59 --> 0:33:5,892
Maybe next year.


956
0:33:5,892 --> 0:33:8,225
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: But
you went from NFL to college.


957
0:33:8,225 --> 0:33:9,1
You just confused
me for a second.


958
0:33:9,1 --> 0:33:10,5
DANICA PATRICK: I did.


959
0:33:10,5 --> 0:33:10,65
I did.


960
0:33:10,65 --> 0:33:12,483
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
But that was actually


961
0:33:12,483 --> 0:33:13,96
a good segue for what I needed.


962
0:33:13,96 --> 0:33:16,21
Sponsorship and brand building.


963
0:33:16,21 --> 0:33:19,584
So let's talk about it.


964
0:33:19,584 --> 0:33:21,0
It's an interesting
thing for you.


965
0:33:21,0 --> 0:33:22,179
You're a brand.


966
0:33:22,179 --> 0:33:23,22
You've got Danica Racing.


967
0:33:23,22 --> 0:33:25,114
You've got your name
as basically a brand.


968
0:33:25,114 --> 0:33:26,78
You've got your
sponsorship relationship


969
0:33:26,78 --> 0:33:29,8
with GoDaddy and
some other companies.


970
0:33:29,8 --> 0:33:31,484
But did you ever actively
think about-- I mean,


971
0:33:31,484 --> 0:33:32,9
you almost mentioned
this when you


972
0:33:32,9 --> 0:33:33,83
talked about the
photo-shoot and how


973
0:33:33,83 --> 0:33:35,57
things started to
happen for you.


974
0:33:35,57 --> 0:33:38,23
Do you ever think, I'm
building a brand here?


975
0:33:38,23 --> 0:33:39,66
When did you realize that?


976
0:33:39,66 --> 0:33:42,67
Or when did you start
to think that way?


977
0:33:42,67 --> 0:33:44,64
DANICA PATRICK: It
took a while for sure.


978
0:33:44,64 --> 0:33:47,2
I mean, I think that
the idea of brand


979
0:33:47,2 --> 0:33:50,42
and the idea of role model
took a little while to set in.


980
0:33:50,42 --> 0:33:52,572
Because it all seems so new.


981
0:33:52,572 --> 0:33:53,53
I'm like, I don't know.


982
0:33:53,53 --> 0:33:56,57
I'm just driving.


983
0:33:56,57 --> 0:33:58,19
And I'm trying to
figure myself out.


984
0:33:58,19 --> 0:34:1,97
But I've been really
fortunate in my career.


985
0:34:1,97 --> 0:34:3,92
I've had great
sponsors along the way.


986
0:34:3,92 --> 0:34:5,41
And Go Daddy being the best.


987
0:34:5,41 --> 0:34:9,8
Where I can be myself.


988
0:34:9,8 --> 0:34:11,15
They stand behind
me no matter what.


989
0:34:11,15 --> 0:34:16,19
And they have great core values.


990
0:34:16,19 --> 0:34:20,4
And they've done some really
great stuff and continue to.


991
0:34:20,4 --> 0:34:23,61
And so brand is very important.


992
0:34:23,61 --> 0:34:26,21
In this day and age,
especially with social media


993
0:34:26,21 --> 0:34:28,19
and everything like
that, we're all


994
0:34:28,19 --> 0:34:30,67
reading through authenticity
pretty quickly and easily.


995
0:34:30,67 --> 0:34:33,1
I think you can tell what's
real and what's not real.


996
0:34:33,1 --> 0:34:37,26
And if there's anything that
I want to do, it's be real.


997
0:34:37,26 --> 0:34:40,9
And be someone
that you can trust.


998
0:34:40,9 --> 0:34:46,219
And someone that you
look at what I'm doing


999
0:34:46,219 --> 0:34:47,52
and you believe in it.


1000
0:34:47,52 --> 0:34:50,179
And so I've been
lucky enough to be


1001
0:34:50,179 --> 0:34:52,73
able to be selective over
the years with my partners.


1002
0:34:52,73 --> 0:34:55,469
And I've got great ones.


1003
0:34:55,469 --> 0:34:57,8
And they're extensions
of who I am.


1004
0:34:57,8 --> 0:35:0,5
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Are
there are other things that


1005
0:35:0,5 --> 0:35:1,53
come to your mind when
you think about what


1006
0:35:1,53 --> 0:35:2,81
you hope everyone relate--


1007
0:35:2,81 --> 0:35:4,144
DANICA PATRICK: Other than fast?


1008
0:35:4,144 --> 0:35:5,31
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Fast.


1009
0:35:5,31 --> 0:35:5,85
Good one.


1010
0:35:5,85 --> 0:35:8,19
DANICA PATRICK:
Well, back in 2009,


1011
0:35:8,19 --> 0:35:12,34
I signed on with IMG, which
is now William Morris.


1012
0:35:12,34 --> 0:35:19,7
But we created a brand statement
or a brand title for me.


1013
0:35:19,7 --> 0:35:22,934
And it was Beautiful Revolution.


1014
0:35:22,934 --> 0:35:24,35
And it was really
just about being


1015
0:35:24,35 --> 0:35:27,6
able to be feminine, be who
you are, but yet be different.


1016
0:35:27,6 --> 0:35:30,87
And so that's the
statement from my--


1017
0:35:30,87 --> 0:35:31,92
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
And be revolutionary.


1018
0:35:31,92 --> 0:35:33,35
And were you an
active participant


1019
0:35:33,35 --> 0:35:33,89
in that whole process?


1020
0:35:33,89 --> 0:35:34,73
DANICA PATRICK: Absolutely.


1021
0:35:34,73 --> 0:35:36,48
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
That's pretty cool.


1022
0:35:36,48 --> 0:35:38,92
DANICA PATRICK: There was all
these storyboards going on.


1023
0:35:38,92 --> 0:35:41,2
And photos of me
doing certain things.


1024
0:35:41,2 --> 0:35:43,11
Categorized stuff
from the internet.


1025
0:35:43,11 --> 0:35:47,37
And it built a story of
what really stands out


1026
0:35:47,37 --> 0:35:49,19
about me in the public eye.


1027
0:35:49,19 --> 0:35:51,27
And what people are
paying attention to.


1028
0:35:51,27 --> 0:35:53,81
And then words start
to get developed


1029
0:35:53,81 --> 0:35:56,84
from those storyboards
and from those collages.


1030
0:35:56,84 --> 0:36:0,945
And then it keeps
whittling down to a title.


1031
0:36:0,945 --> 0:36:2,7
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Wow.


1032
0:36:2,7 --> 0:36:2,652
Cool.


1033
0:36:2,652 --> 0:36:4,11
So I think we have
a picture of you


1034
0:36:4,11 --> 0:36:8,7
at the Country Music Awards or--


1035
0:36:8,7 --> 0:36:10,25
DANICA PATRICK: The
American Country Awards.


1036
0:36:10,25 --> 0:36:12,12
Oh my gosh.


1037
0:36:12,12 --> 0:36:14,67
That's the best shot I've
seen of the height difference.


1038
0:36:14,67 --> 0:36:15,76
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
If we have time--


1039
0:36:15,76 --> 0:36:16,58
DANICA PATRICK: I have boots on.


1040
0:36:16,58 --> 0:36:16,86
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
If we have time


1041
0:36:16,86 --> 0:36:18,74
later we'll show a
funny video from this.


1042
0:36:18,74 --> 0:36:20,89
But we're going to
run short on time.


1043
0:36:20,89 --> 0:36:23,47
But I wanted to ask you about
when you do stuff like this.


1044
0:36:23,47 --> 0:36:25,27
When you make these choices.


1045
0:36:25,27 --> 0:36:27,835
Besides they don't let you
choose your co-host, I guess.


1046
0:36:27,835 --> 0:36:28,71
Or your co-presenter.


1047
0:36:28,71 --> 0:36:29,814
DANICA PATRICK:
No, he was great.


1048
0:36:29,814 --> 0:36:30,183
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: He's so tall.


1049
0:36:30,183 --> 0:36:32,26
DANICA PATRICK: Chris is great.


1050
0:36:32,26 --> 0:36:33,44
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Do
you think about your brand?


1051
0:36:33,44 --> 0:36:34,76
Do you think about
what's fun for you?


1052
0:36:34,76 --> 0:36:36,115
Or whether you have
time in your schedule?


1053
0:36:36,115 --> 0:36:37,24
DANICA PATRICK: Absolutely.


1054
0:36:37,24 --> 0:36:39,2
I think about
things that are fun.


1055
0:36:39,2 --> 0:36:40,78
I don't know--
Does anybody listen


1056
0:36:40,78 --> 0:36:42,85
to country music in here?


1057
0:36:42,85 --> 0:36:43,53
Not many.


1058
0:36:43,53 --> 0:36:44,85
I'm not surprised.


1059
0:36:44,85 --> 0:36:45,965
We're in California.


1060
0:36:45,965 --> 0:36:46,84
It's OK.


1061
0:36:46,84 --> 0:36:48,57
But I know there's
some of you out there.


1062
0:36:48,57 --> 0:36:51,59
So it was one of those
things-- country music


1063
0:36:51,59 --> 0:36:52,72
it just happened for me.


1064
0:36:52,72 --> 0:36:53,94
I never, ever listened to it.


1065
0:36:53,94 --> 0:36:56,44
And my dad always
said, it feels like I'm


1066
0:36:56,44 --> 0:36:59,8
kissing a horse when I
listen to this stuff.


1067
0:36:59,8 --> 0:37:3,47
So my upbringing, which
I feel like dictates


1068
0:37:3,47 --> 0:37:7,16
who we are-- seeing your parents
and seeing the way you grew up


1069
0:37:7,16 --> 0:37:9,319
is an explanation
and not an excuse.


1070
0:37:9,319 --> 0:37:11,11
You are who you are
because of your family.


1071
0:37:11,11 --> 0:37:13,53
And my dad hated country music.


1072
0:37:13,53 --> 0:37:15,28
So I never listened to it.


1073
0:37:15,28 --> 0:37:17,71
And so I got to NASCAR.


1074
0:37:17,71 --> 0:37:19,85
And I mean GAC.


1075
0:37:19,85 --> 0:37:21,43
GAC is on the TV.


1076
0:37:21,43 --> 0:37:23,27
And it's all country
bumpkin music.


1077
0:37:23,27 --> 0:37:27,43
And I just wasn't
having any of it.


1078
0:37:27,43 --> 0:37:30,59
I did a music video
with Miranda Lambert.


1079
0:37:30,59 --> 0:37:32,55
And it was called
"Fastest Girl in Town."


1080
0:37:32,55 --> 0:37:34,86
And I had not heard her song.


1081
0:37:34,86 --> 0:37:35,96
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
She seems pretty cool.


1082
0:37:35,96 --> 0:37:37,24
DANICA PATRICK:
She is very cool.


1083
0:37:37,24 --> 0:37:38,28
But I hadn't heard her song.


1084
0:37:38,28 --> 0:37:39,78
And it was already
out on the radio.


1085
0:37:39,78 --> 0:37:41,31
So I felt kind of bad.


1086
0:37:41,31 --> 0:37:44,42
So I thought, I'll
get her albums.


1087
0:37:44,42 --> 0:37:47,439
And she had just started a
new band with two other girls.


1088
0:37:47,439 --> 0:37:48,98
And they're called
the Pistol Annies.


1089
0:37:48,98 --> 0:37:50,35
So I got that too.


1090
0:37:50,35 --> 0:37:51,34
And I listened to them.


1091
0:37:51,34 --> 0:37:54,66
And I was like, I think
I like country music.


1092
0:37:54,66 --> 0:37:56,239
And it just happened like that.


1093
0:37:56,239 --> 0:37:57,78
Now it's pretty much
all I listen to.


1094
0:37:57,78 --> 0:38:0,97
So when the American
Country Awards


1095
0:38:0,97 --> 0:38:4,6
asked me to co-host
the show, I'm like,


1096
0:38:4,6 --> 0:38:5,65
you mean present, right?


1097
0:38:5,65 --> 0:38:6,86
No, co-host.


1098
0:38:6,86 --> 0:38:7,53
OK.


1099
0:38:7,53 --> 0:38:7,775
So--


1100
0:38:7,775 --> 0:38:8,2
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
That's a lot of work.


1101
0:38:8,2 --> 0:38:9,77
DANICA PATRICK: It was
a huge undertaking.


1102
0:38:9,77 --> 0:38:12,26
And I'm extremely decisive.


1103
0:38:12,26 --> 0:38:14,472
You don't have to ask twice.


1104
0:38:14,472 --> 0:38:15,93
You might have to
tell me something


1105
0:38:15,93 --> 0:38:16,889
twice because I forget.


1106
0:38:16,889 --> 0:38:18,68
But you don't have to
ask a question twice.


1107
0:38:18,68 --> 0:38:20,51
And my agent asked me
if I wanted to do it.


1108
0:38:20,51 --> 0:38:22,75
And he's like,
this is a big deal.


1109
0:38:22,75 --> 0:38:24,44
This is a definite yes.


1110
0:38:24,44 --> 0:38:27,8
And I'm like, I'm going
to need to call you back.


1111
0:38:27,8 --> 0:38:30,12
And in the past he would
tell me, call me back


1112
0:38:30,12 --> 0:38:30,91
and let me know.


1113
0:38:30,91 --> 0:38:33,55
And I would say, Alan, the
only thing I'm going to do


1114
0:38:33,55 --> 0:38:34,84
is forget to call you back.


1115
0:38:34,84 --> 0:38:36,36
I already know the answer.


1116
0:38:36,36 --> 0:38:38,7
And so I told him,
I think I'm going


1117
0:38:38,7 --> 0:38:40,49
to need to call you
back on this one.


1118
0:38:40,49 --> 0:38:42,51
And I asked around about
what people thought.


1119
0:38:42,51 --> 0:38:45,65
Basically, did anybody
think I could handle this?


1120
0:38:45,65 --> 0:38:47,686
So I said yes and it was--


1121
0:38:47,686 --> 0:38:50,6
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Because
that's like multiple hours


1122
0:38:50,6 --> 0:38:51,717
being up on that stage.


1123
0:38:51,717 --> 0:38:53,3
DANICA PATRICK: It's
a shorter country


1124
0:38:53,3 --> 0:38:54,57
show but it's two hours.


1125
0:38:54,57 --> 0:38:56,53
And you're co-hosting.


1126
0:38:56,53 --> 0:38:58,32
So it's important.


1127
0:38:58,32 --> 0:39:3,37
And I ended up singing
and dancing on the show.


1128
0:39:3,37 --> 0:39:6,429
I wore a showgirl outfit
at one point in time.


1129
0:39:6,429 --> 0:39:8,97
You should have seen the number
they wanted me to wear first.


1130
0:39:8,97 --> 0:39:10,841
I tempered it to
feel comfortable.


1131
0:39:10,841 --> 0:39:12,34
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: Good for you.


1132
0:39:12,34 --> 0:39:13,71
DANICA PATRICK: Because you've
got to feel comfortable.


1133
0:39:13,71 --> 0:39:15,25
And of course that's
the photo that


1134
0:39:15,25 --> 0:39:17,59
makes the magazine or newspaper.


1135
0:39:17,59 --> 0:39:18,55
But it went great.


1136
0:39:18,55 --> 0:39:19,49
It was a lot of fun.


1137
0:39:19,49 --> 0:39:21,906
And more than anything, it was
about having an experience.


1138
0:39:21,906 --> 0:39:23,34
And growing as a person.


1139
0:39:23,34 --> 0:39:26,25
And doing something
outside of my comfort zone.


1140
0:39:26,25 --> 0:39:27,9
I'm much more comfortable
answering questions


1141
0:39:27,9 --> 0:39:29,81
than I am reading a
prompter and having


1142
0:39:29,81 --> 0:39:31,101
to do something pre-programmed.


1143
0:39:31,101 --> 0:39:33,124



1144
0:39:33,124 --> 0:39:35,54
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Back
to the advice and we'll close.


1145
0:39:35,54 --> 0:39:37,59
And we'll talk a little
bit about internet


1146
0:39:37,59 --> 0:39:40,48
and small businesses and things.


1147
0:39:40,48 --> 0:39:42,11
You really stretched
yourself, right?


1148
0:39:42,11 --> 0:39:44,34
You did something you weren't
that comfortable doing.


1149
0:39:44,34 --> 0:39:44,97
Where do you--


1150
0:39:44,97 --> 0:39:45,986
DANICA PATRICK: I mean, I've
always wanted to be a singer,


1151
0:39:45,986 --> 0:39:46,791
but I'm not.


1152
0:39:46,791 --> 0:39:48,79
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
But you sang on the show.


1153
0:39:48,79 --> 0:39:49,82
DANICA PATRICK: I sang a lot.


1154
0:39:49,82 --> 0:39:50,69
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
Where does that come from?


1155
0:39:50,69 --> 0:39:52,28
I mean, if you're talking
to people in the room


1156
0:39:52,28 --> 0:39:54,48
here who are thinking
of trying something new


1157
0:39:54,48 --> 0:39:57,0
or doing something different.


1158
0:39:57,0 --> 0:39:59,579
DANICA PATRICK: I mean, I think
that's the only way you grow.


1159
0:39:59,579 --> 0:40:1,12
And that's the only
way you can start


1160
0:40:1,12 --> 0:40:2,78
to learn your real capabilities.


1161
0:40:2,78 --> 0:40:4,96
And what I've learned
over the years with me,


1162
0:40:4,96 --> 0:40:8,3
is that trying new things ends
up usually going pretty well.


1163
0:40:8,3 --> 0:40:10,2
And that's where
you start to get


1164
0:40:10,2 --> 0:40:11,77
more confidence in yourself.


1165
0:40:11,77 --> 0:40:15,96
And if anything, you
just learn something.


1166
0:40:15,96 --> 0:40:18,4
And you have an experience.


1167
0:40:18,4 --> 0:40:20,13
And life is about experiences.


1168
0:40:20,13 --> 0:40:24,71
And if something exciting
comes your way just say yes.


1169
0:40:24,71 --> 0:40:25,97
Just try something new.


1170
0:40:25,97 --> 0:40:26,98
And not be afraid.


1171
0:40:26,98 --> 0:40:28,92
And the worst thing
you do is fail.


1172
0:40:28,92 --> 0:40:30,47
And you just don't
do it anymore.


1173
0:40:30,47 --> 0:40:33,17
Or you try again.


1174
0:40:33,17 --> 0:40:36,29
So new experiences
are how you grow.


1175
0:40:36,29 --> 0:40:38,73
And I think that, that goes
back to the core of-- even


1176
0:40:38,73 --> 0:40:41,7
just living in a new
country when I was 16.


1177
0:40:41,7 --> 0:40:43,35
I grew up so fast
because I did that.


1178
0:40:43,35 --> 0:40:46,5
And it's about doing things
that are outside of your comfort


1179
0:40:46,5 --> 0:40:46,9
zone.


1180
0:40:46,9 --> 0:40:48,301
Something you would not do.


1181
0:40:48,301 --> 0:40:49,8
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: That's great.


1182
0:40:49,8 --> 0:40:55,95
So speaking of about building
businesses and brands


1183
0:40:55,95 --> 0:40:57,54
and doing some new things.


1184
0:40:57,54 --> 0:40:59,3
One of things that
is not new for you


1185
0:40:59,3 --> 0:41:0,38
is your relationship
with GoDaddy.


1186
0:41:0,38 --> 0:41:1,57
But we're going to
talk a little bit


1187
0:41:1,57 --> 0:41:2,94
about the commercial this year.


1188
0:41:2,94 --> 0:41:6,2
And the internet and
small businesses.


1189
0:41:6,2 --> 0:41:8,32
In your own brand building
and business building,


1190
0:41:8,32 --> 0:41:10,1
how important has
the internet been?


1191
0:41:10,1 --> 0:41:11,18
You mentioned social media.


1192
0:41:11,18 --> 0:41:12,79
You mentioned
people really being


1193
0:41:12,79 --> 0:41:15,72
able to smell whether
something's authentic or not.


1194
0:41:15,72 --> 0:41:18,78
Do you use any Google products?


1195
0:41:18,78 --> 0:41:20,357
Do you use technology a lot?


1196
0:41:20,357 --> 0:41:21,69
DANICA PATRICK: I google myself.


1197
0:41:21,69 --> 0:41:24,26
Is that bad?


1198
0:41:24,26 --> 0:41:26,1
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
No, that's not bad.


1199
0:41:26,1 --> 0:41:29,68
DANICA PATRICK: I actually
google my name and Ricky's name


1200
0:41:29,68 --> 0:41:33,17
and I look for new photos of us.


1201
0:41:33,17 --> 0:41:35,56
Because we get candid
ones taken at the track.


1202
0:41:35,56 --> 0:41:36,78
And I never see them.


1203
0:41:36,78 --> 0:41:38,45



1204
0:41:38,45 --> 0:41:40,17
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: I
do not have pictures of me


1205
0:41:40,17 --> 0:41:42,44
and my husband on the
internet when I google.


1206
0:41:42,44 --> 0:41:45,47
DANICA PATRICK: I will say that
Google is the only thing I ever


1207
0:41:45,47 --> 0:41:46,651
use for search engine.


1208
0:41:46,651 --> 0:41:47,15
Always.


1209
0:41:47,15 --> 0:41:48,94
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Oh,
we're very happy to hear that.


1210
0:41:48,94 --> 0:41:49,844
Thank you.


1211
0:41:49,844 --> 0:41:53,131



1212
0:41:53,131 --> 0:41:53,63
OK.


1213
0:41:53,63 --> 0:41:55,61
That was a shameless
Google question.


1214
0:41:55,61 --> 0:41:57,509
DANICA PATRICK:
That's the truth.


1215
0:41:57,509 --> 0:42:0,5
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Do you
think about building businesses


1216
0:42:0,5 --> 0:42:2,508
online or the work that GoDaddy
does with small businesses?


1217
0:42:2,508 --> 0:42:5,7
How do you think about that?


1218
0:42:5,7 --> 0:42:6,937
Or are you separate
from their business?


1219
0:42:6,937 --> 0:42:9,27
DANICA PATRICK: Where I came
from-- I mean my first Indy


1220
0:42:9,27 --> 0:42:13,732
500 in 2005.


1221
0:42:13,732 --> 0:42:16,7
My website shut down because
there was too much traffic.


1222
0:42:16,7 --> 0:42:17,76
It couldn't handle it.


1223
0:42:17,76 --> 0:42:18,301
I don't know.


1224
0:42:18,301 --> 0:42:19,69
The server wasn't big enough.


1225
0:42:19,69 --> 0:42:22,47
We didn't see that coming.


1226
0:42:22,47 --> 0:42:23,26
So--


1227
0:42:23,26 --> 0:42:24,52
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: So
that taught you a lesson.


1228
0:42:24,52 --> 0:42:26,95
DANICA PATRICK: It taught
me a lesson in 2005


1229
0:42:26,95 --> 0:42:28,7
about being prepared.


1230
0:42:28,7 --> 0:42:31,6
But also about how much
interest there is there.


1231
0:42:31,6 --> 0:42:34,37
And like you said,
I'm usually one


1232
0:42:34,37 --> 0:42:35,69
of the more searched athletes.


1233
0:42:35,69 --> 0:42:41,58
And so internet is a huge source
of how we learn about things.


1234
0:42:41,58 --> 0:42:45,45
How we maybe choose to
cheer for something.


1235
0:42:45,45 --> 0:42:47,0
Choose to like something.


1236
0:42:47,0 --> 0:42:50,31
I mean, I use it all
the time for everything.


1237
0:42:50,31 --> 0:42:52,81
I mean, GoDaddy is all
about small businesses.


1238
0:42:52,81 --> 0:42:55,12
And for me that
taps right into me.


1239
0:42:55,12 --> 0:42:57,0
I mean, I'm finding
new gyms to go


1240
0:42:57,0 --> 0:42:58,65
to because I'm
always on the road.


1241
0:42:58,65 --> 0:42:59,46
A restaurant.


1242
0:42:59,46 --> 0:43:0,19
A store.


1243
0:43:0,19 --> 0:43:0,88
You name it.


1244
0:43:0,88 --> 0:43:1,82
A hotel.


1245
0:43:1,82 --> 0:43:2,82
I need locations.


1246
0:43:2,82 --> 0:43:3,92
I need hours.


1247
0:43:3,92 --> 0:43:6,85
And if you're not on the
internet, I can't find you.


1248
0:43:6,85 --> 0:43:10,13
So I use the
internet constantly.


1249
0:43:10,13 --> 0:43:13,63
And it's been a
source of how I've


1250
0:43:13,63 --> 0:43:15,43
gotten to where I am today.


1251
0:43:15,43 --> 0:43:19,7
And it can also be a
source for someone else


1252
0:43:19,7 --> 0:43:21,25
to see their dreams
come true, too,


1253
0:43:21,25 --> 0:43:23,11
by making themselves relative.


1254
0:43:23,11 --> 0:43:25,44
I feel like if you're
not on the internet,


1255
0:43:25,44 --> 0:43:28,537
you're not relevant
in this day and age.


1256
0:43:28,537 --> 0:43:29,87
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: We agree.


1257
0:43:29,87 --> 0:43:30,97
Thank you for saying that.


1258
0:43:30,97 --> 0:43:32,97
We'd love to see more
businesses get online.


1259
0:43:32,97 --> 0:43:35,81
And we're thrilled that GoDaddy
does so much work to help them.


1260
0:43:35,81 --> 0:43:38,38
When you think about your
relationship with GoDaddy--


1261
0:43:38,38 --> 0:43:41,14
I mean you've been in the
most Superbowl commercials


1262
0:43:41,14 --> 0:43:43,27
of any celebrity or
some stat like that.


1263
0:43:43,27 --> 0:43:44,379
Which is kind of wild.


1264
0:43:44,379 --> 0:43:45,17
But think about it.


1265
0:43:45,17 --> 0:43:45,7
DANICA PATRICK: It
is kind of weird.


1266
0:43:45,7 --> 0:43:46,94
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: And
that's since 2007, right?


1267
0:43:46,94 --> 0:43:48,42
DANICA PATRICK: It's like 100
million people every time.


1268
0:43:48,42 --> 0:43:48,95
That's crazy.


1269
0:43:48,95 --> 0:43:49,68
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: That's a lot.


1270
0:43:49,68 --> 0:43:50,9
That's a lot of eyeballs.


1271
0:43:50,9 --> 0:43:53,53
A lot of impressions.


1272
0:43:53,53 --> 0:43:55,57
Then you've got
the YouTube people


1273
0:43:55,57 --> 0:43:58,67
watching it all over again,
which we see a lot of.


1274
0:43:58,67 --> 0:44:0,935
When you think about how
their advertising has evolved


1275
0:44:0,935 --> 0:44:2,81
and what they're planning
now for this year--


1276
0:44:2,81 --> 0:44:5,101
I don't know how much you're
allowed to talk about it--


1277
0:44:5,101 --> 0:44:7,68
but you've grown up together.


1278
0:44:7,68 --> 0:44:10,309
Do you work together on
the creative concepts?


1279
0:44:10,309 --> 0:44:12,6
Or do you do show up and
they're like, here's the plan.


1280
0:44:12,6 --> 0:44:13,43
How does it work?


1281
0:44:13,43 --> 0:44:14,805
DANICA PATRICK:
A little of both.


1282
0:44:14,805 --> 0:44:18,22
But there's always that trump
card of, I don't like that.


1283
0:44:18,22 --> 0:44:21,21
There always has been.


1284
0:44:21,21 --> 0:44:22,87
We both respect each other.


1285
0:44:22,87 --> 0:44:25,97
And so it's been a
great relationship


1286
0:44:25,97 --> 0:44:26,97
from the very beginning.


1287
0:44:26,97 --> 0:44:28,386
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: So anything


1288
0:44:28,386 --> 0:44:30,2
you could tell us
about this year's ad?


1289
0:44:30,2 --> 0:44:31,25
DANICA PATRICK: No, not really.


1290
0:44:31,25 --> 0:44:32,5
I mean, I think there was some
photos that got out there.


1291
0:44:32,5 --> 0:44:33,61
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
I heard it's different.


1292
0:44:33,61 --> 0:44:34,79
I heard it's different.


1293
0:44:34,79 --> 0:44:36,54
DANICA PATRICK: Yeah,
there's two of them.


1294
0:44:36,54 --> 0:44:37,74
I'm in one of them.


1295
0:44:37,74 --> 0:44:39,156
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: And they're


1296
0:44:39,156 --> 0:44:41,64
talking about
getting found online.


1297
0:44:41,64 --> 0:44:42,72
I've been told that much.


1298
0:44:42,72 --> 0:44:43,14
DANICA PATRICK: Yeah.


1299
0:44:43,14 --> 0:44:44,54
Well, it's all about that.


1300
0:44:44,54 --> 0:44:49,9
And it's definitely
about showing women now


1301
0:44:49,9 --> 0:44:53,15
in a really powerful way of
being small business owners.


1302
0:44:53,15 --> 0:44:55,29
Being confident.


1303
0:44:55,29 --> 0:44:57,76
And trying to see
their dreams come true.


1304
0:44:57,76 --> 0:45:0,1
And so I like that.


1305
0:45:0,1 --> 0:45:2,31
I mean, I completely
relate to that.


1306
0:45:2,31 --> 0:45:4,101
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
Do think of yourself


1307
0:45:4,101 --> 0:45:6,689
as a small business owner?


1308
0:45:6,689 --> 0:45:8,73
DANICA PATRICK: I mean,
I guess I do more so now.


1309
0:45:8,73 --> 0:45:10,23
I think about it.


1310
0:45:10,23 --> 0:45:12,42
And I think about it in
the long-term of like,


1311
0:45:12,42 --> 0:45:14,44
at some point in time I
won't be racing anymore.


1312
0:45:14,44 --> 0:45:15,731
And then what am I going to do?


1313
0:45:15,731 --> 0:45:18,2
So building the brand
up to a certain point


1314
0:45:18,2 --> 0:45:19,84
and then maybe
branching off so that


1315
0:45:19,84 --> 0:45:23,3
when I retire from
racing-- I'm probably


1316
0:45:23,3 --> 0:45:25,57
not going to be
65-- I'll still have


1317
0:45:25,57 --> 0:45:30,204
something fun to do
outside of racing.


1318
0:45:30,204 --> 0:45:31,62
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: Do you have


1319
0:45:31,62 --> 0:45:33,544
advice for women in business?


1320
0:45:33,544 --> 0:45:35,585
When you think about
yourself as a business woman


1321
0:45:35,585 --> 0:45:40,131
or your future-- you've given
a lot of great advice actually


1322
0:45:40,131 --> 0:45:42,63
this whole talk-- but when you
think about the business side


1323
0:45:42,63 --> 0:45:43,4
of it--


1324
0:45:43,4 --> 0:45:45,581
DANICA PATRICK: I mean, I think
that first and foremost, it's


1325
0:45:45,581 --> 0:45:48,3
making sure that it is
something that you love doing.


1326
0:45:48,3 --> 0:45:50,0
But then it's about confidence.


1327
0:45:50,0 --> 0:45:51,9
I mean, I remember
being a kid and going


1328
0:45:51,9 --> 0:45:53,8
into a business meeting.


1329
0:45:53,8 --> 0:45:57,63
And I said a lot of I
thinks and maybes and likes.


1330
0:45:57,63 --> 0:46:1,33
And it's about being
poignant, confident.


1331
0:46:1,33 --> 0:46:2,185
You want this.


1332
0:46:2,185 --> 0:46:3,96
This is what's going to happen.


1333
0:46:3,96 --> 0:46:5,91
And being aggressive
with your words.


1334
0:46:5,91 --> 0:46:10,48
And I think that that's
something to always keep


1335
0:46:10,48 --> 0:46:12,587
in mind-- is to
just be confident


1336
0:46:12,587 --> 0:46:13,67
through the whole process.


1337
0:46:13,67 --> 0:46:17,7
And the way that at least
I've generated confidence,


1338
0:46:17,7 --> 0:46:20,24
is by doing my homework and
being smart about something.


1339
0:46:20,24 --> 0:46:21,22
And knowledge is power.


1340
0:46:21,22 --> 0:46:22,72
And those old
commercials when I was


1341
0:46:22,72 --> 0:46:25,85
a kid watching Sunday morning
cartoons-- knowledge is power


1342
0:46:25,85 --> 0:46:27,57
and stars flew
across the screen.


1343
0:46:27,57 --> 0:46:28,33
It's true.


1344
0:46:28,33 --> 0:46:28,92
It's true.


1345
0:46:28,92 --> 0:46:33,49
You can't be in full
control and know everything


1346
0:46:33,49 --> 0:46:36,16
and do a good job unless
you really do your homework


1347
0:46:36,16 --> 0:46:37,556
and know what you're asking for.


1348
0:46:37,556 --> 0:46:38,93
What you're trying
to accomplish.


1349
0:46:38,93 --> 0:46:42,47
So confidence and
doing your homework.


1350
0:46:42,47 --> 0:46:43,88
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
You sound like you're


1351
0:46:43,88 --> 0:46:46,0
someone who works a lot
on being well-prepared.


1352
0:46:46,0 --> 0:46:48,809
I mean you must have prepared
for this thing a lot.


1353
0:46:48,809 --> 0:46:49,6
DANICA PATRICK: OK.


1354
0:46:49,6 --> 0:46:50,391
Quick little story.


1355
0:46:50,391 --> 0:46:53,18
So I got there to
Vegas and it was


1356
0:46:53,18 --> 0:46:55,17
like four or five
days before the show.


1357
0:46:55,17 --> 0:46:56,92
I didn't have anything yet.


1358
0:46:56,92 --> 0:46:58,62
I saw the opening.


1359
0:46:58,62 --> 0:47:0,88
The cold opening was a pre-tape.


1360
0:47:0,88 --> 0:47:1,86
And I had seen that.


1361
0:47:1,86 --> 0:47:3,4
But I saw nothing else.


1362
0:47:3,4 --> 0:47:4,86
So it's just how it works.


1363
0:47:4,86 --> 0:47:9,44
Because the writers that do
all the shows-- the writers


1364
0:47:9,44 --> 0:47:10,5
they do all the shows.


1365
0:47:10,5 --> 0:47:12,762
So they came off of
a show that had just


1366
0:47:12,762 --> 0:47:13,97
aired a couple weeks earlier.


1367
0:47:13,97 --> 0:47:15,71
And then they started
writing the ACA's.


1368
0:47:15,71 --> 0:47:18,43
So it was like, you don't
really have content.


1369
0:47:18,43 --> 0:47:20,1
So it kind of scared me.


1370
0:47:20,1 --> 0:47:25,16
So it wasn't until we went
into our first rehearsal was


1371
0:47:25,16 --> 0:47:28,9
on-- the show was on
Tuesday-- Saturday


1372
0:47:28,9 --> 0:47:32,14
we went and read prompter and
did blocks or whatever it is.


1373
0:47:32,14 --> 0:47:36,54
And we read the script
on the prompter.


1374
0:47:36,54 --> 0:47:37,99
I had never seen the script.


1375
0:47:37,99 --> 0:47:41,92
And I'm reading it on prompter
for the very first time.


1376
0:47:41,92 --> 0:47:45,8
And so it was a mild disaster.


1377
0:47:45,8 --> 0:47:50,69
And so, I mean, words
like, a bad rehearsal


1378
0:47:50,69 --> 0:47:53,54
is a good sign for a good
show, they were telling me.


1379
0:47:53,54 --> 0:47:55,1
And I'm like, shoot.


1380
0:47:55,1 --> 0:47:58,535
So it was a whole
new experience.


1381
0:47:58,535 --> 0:48:0,48
It was like cramming for a test.


1382
0:48:0,48 --> 0:48:2,46
As if I ever did that.


1383
0:48:2,46 --> 0:48:7,36
But it was solid Saturday,
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday of line


1384
0:48:7,36 --> 0:48:9,25
reads and going over things.


1385
0:48:9,25 --> 0:48:10,75
I mean, I had to
do a dance routine.


1386
0:48:10,75 --> 0:48:12,42
So I would just
stop, drop, and roll.


1387
0:48:12,42 --> 0:48:13,714
I would just do it on the spot.


1388
0:48:13,714 --> 0:48:15,13
Just so that I
could know I didn't


1389
0:48:15,13 --> 0:48:16,83
need to think about the dance.


1390
0:48:16,83 --> 0:48:19,47
And it was just all
about repetition.


1391
0:48:19,47 --> 0:48:21,67
So it was like cramming
for those days.


1392
0:48:21,67 --> 0:48:22,17
Completely.


1393
0:48:22,17 --> 0:48:23,93
Claire Hughes Johnson: You did
prepare, but it was intense.


1394
0:48:23,93 --> 0:48:24,66
DANICA PATRICK:
I mean, my calves


1395
0:48:24,66 --> 0:48:26,64
hurt from doing that
little dance so much.


1396
0:48:26,64 --> 0:48:28,29
It was only 17 seconds.


1397
0:48:28,29 --> 0:48:32,182
But it was long enough for my
calves to hurt for three days.


1398
0:48:32,182 --> 0:48:33,64
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: You couldn't


1399
0:48:33,64 --> 0:48:34,65
get me to dance
for five seconds.


1400
0:48:34,65 --> 0:48:35,1
So good job.


1401
0:48:35,1 --> 0:48:36,85
DANICA PATRICK: But
it was great because I


1402
0:48:36,85 --> 0:48:38,6
was by far outside
of my comfort zone.


1403
0:48:38,6 --> 0:48:39,517
But it was really fun.


1404
0:48:39,517 --> 0:48:41,58
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
That is great.


1405
0:48:41,58 --> 0:48:42,4
So a couple of final questions.


1406
0:48:42,4 --> 0:48:44,66
When you think about
all your balancing,


1407
0:48:44,66 --> 0:48:47,33
you're an entrepreneur, a
race car driver, obviously.


1408
0:48:47,33 --> 0:48:48,539
You've done things like this.


1409
0:48:48,539 --> 0:48:50,913
You've got your family that
you spend a lot of time with.


1410
0:48:50,913 --> 0:48:53,35
How do you balance all
those competing priorities?


1411
0:48:53,35 --> 0:48:55,73
Do you have a
framework in your head?


1412
0:48:55,73 --> 0:48:57,28
Or do you just take
it as it comes?


1413
0:48:57,28 --> 0:48:59,61
DANICA PATRICK: I think
you have to take some of it


1414
0:48:59,61 --> 0:49:1,49
as it comes because
sometimes it's new.


1415
0:49:1,49 --> 0:49:5,98
But for me it's definitely
been a little bit


1416
0:49:5,98 --> 0:49:6,88
of trial and error.


1417
0:49:6,88 --> 0:49:10,11
And as your life changes and
evolves, then gets bigger,


1418
0:49:10,11 --> 0:49:12,45
essentially I feel
like the older you get


1419
0:49:12,45 --> 0:49:14,2
there's more to
manage and balance.


1420
0:49:14,2 --> 0:49:17,7
And you just have to find
out what your own rhythm is.


1421
0:49:17,7 --> 0:49:19,93
How you like to
operate in your day?


1422
0:49:19,93 --> 0:49:21,357
How you like to
prioritize things?


1423
0:49:21,357 --> 0:49:22,94
Do you like to bunch
your schedule up?


1424
0:49:22,94 --> 0:49:24,13
Do you like to spread it out?


1425
0:49:24,13 --> 0:49:25,838
Do you need to make
sure there's lunches?


1426
0:49:25,838 --> 0:49:27,87
I mean, down to all
those kinds of things.


1427
0:49:27,87 --> 0:49:29,84
Just, how do you
like to run your day?


1428
0:49:29,84 --> 0:49:34,22
And so I've figured
out what that is.


1429
0:49:34,22 --> 0:49:36,71
Now mind you, I mean
I was pretty exhausted


1430
0:49:36,71 --> 0:49:38,247
by the end of that
show in December.


1431
0:49:38,247 --> 0:49:40,33
And the rest of the stuff
I had to do in December.


1432
0:49:40,33 --> 0:49:43,32
But sometimes you
have to bend a little.


1433
0:49:43,32 --> 0:49:45,497
But you just can't get to
the point that you break.


1434
0:49:45,497 --> 0:49:47,58
If you break then that's
where the problems start.


1435
0:49:47,58 --> 0:49:49,85
And then it breaks
everything else down.


1436
0:49:49,85 --> 0:49:52,8
So it's OK to say no.


1437
0:49:52,8 --> 0:49:55,519
And as long as it comes from
a good, honest place of,


1438
0:49:55,519 --> 0:49:57,31
I'm not going to be
good for this situation


1439
0:49:57,31 --> 0:50:0,93
if I say yes, or good for
myself or good for my family,


1440
0:50:0,93 --> 0:50:2,27
then you just say no.


1441
0:50:2,27 --> 0:50:5,27
And you move on and know
that you're better for it.


1442
0:50:5,27 --> 0:50:7,532
And find those
little things that


1443
0:50:7,532 --> 0:50:8,74
make you happy along the way.


1444
0:50:8,74 --> 0:50:12,16
Whether it's going to get
a pedicure or massage.


1445
0:50:12,16 --> 0:50:15,25
For me, just sitting down
and playing Candy Crush.


1446
0:50:15,25 --> 0:50:16,244
Just whatever it is.


1447
0:50:16,244 --> 0:50:18,41
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: Is
that on your mobile phone?


1448
0:50:18,41 --> 0:50:19,8
DANICA PATRICK: It is.


1449
0:50:19,8 --> 0:50:23,0
Ricky and I are always competing
against who's ahead of who.


1450
0:50:23,0 --> 0:50:24,189
I'm behind right now.


1451
0:50:24,189 --> 0:50:26,73
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: So you
need to get over done with this


1452
0:50:26,73 --> 0:50:29,26
and do some Candy Crush.


1453
0:50:29,26 --> 0:50:31,26
And the final thing you
mentioned for your team,


1454
0:50:31,26 --> 0:50:33,86
that you focus a lot
on morale and being


1455
0:50:33,86 --> 0:50:36,51
someone who keeps
them motivated and up.


1456
0:50:36,51 --> 0:50:40,31
When you think about leadership
and being a role model, which


1457
0:50:40,31 --> 0:50:41,98
you said came to
you, you realized,


1458
0:50:41,98 --> 0:50:44,756
wow-- you are a role
model, by the way.


1459
0:50:44,756 --> 0:50:47,15
I have a colleague here
who brought her daughter


1460
0:50:47,15 --> 0:50:49,14
because her daughter
wrote a paper about you.


1461
0:50:49,14 --> 0:50:50,83
I think.


1462
0:50:50,83 --> 0:50:55,49
How do you carry
that responsibility?


1463
0:50:55,49 --> 0:50:56,657
What kind of leader are you?


1464
0:50:56,657 --> 0:50:58,239
How do you think
about being a leader?


1465
0:50:58,239 --> 0:51:0,17
How do you think about
being a role model?


1466
0:51:0,17 --> 0:51:4,66
Is that hard to have to
think about all the time?


1467
0:51:4,66 --> 0:51:10,11
DANICA PATRICK: I think that
it's about being yourself.


1468
0:51:10,11 --> 0:51:12,7
And then you can
really never screw up.


1469
0:51:12,7 --> 0:51:17,59
And I always encourage everyone,
whether they're young or old,


1470
0:51:17,59 --> 0:51:21,25
to do what you love to
do and be who you are.


1471
0:51:21,25 --> 0:51:24,67
And then you can't ever make
a mistake along the way.


1472
0:51:24,67 --> 0:51:26,8
You just are being who you are.


1473
0:51:26,8 --> 0:51:28,73
And if I get fiery and
intense at the racetrack,


1474
0:51:28,73 --> 0:51:29,61
I'm not shocking you.


1475
0:51:29,61 --> 0:51:30,66
I've done this before.


1476
0:51:30,66 --> 0:51:31,61
But that's who I am.


1477
0:51:31,61 --> 0:51:34,78
And if you don't like it at
least you can respect it.


1478
0:51:34,78 --> 0:51:37,999
So that's how I operate
in my days and my life.


1479
0:51:37,999 --> 0:51:40,4
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
When did you realize that?


1480
0:51:40,4 --> 0:51:41,65
That you just have
to be who you are.


1481
0:51:41,65 --> 0:51:45,76



1482
0:51:45,76 --> 0:51:47,98
DANICA PATRICK: I think that
it just grows over time.


1483
0:51:47,98 --> 0:51:50,33
I think it's grown
over time to realize


1484
0:51:50,33 --> 0:51:53,57
that you can be
different and it's OK.


1485
0:51:53,57 --> 0:51:56,5
And that you can
have an opinion.


1486
0:51:56,5 --> 0:51:58,73
And in fact, I'm a
consumer, for sure.


1487
0:51:58,73 --> 0:52:1,51
And when I watch
things or people,


1488
0:52:1,51 --> 0:52:3,69
I don't just want to
watch people telling me


1489
0:52:3,69 --> 0:52:5,16
what I'm supposed to be hearing.


1490
0:52:5,16 --> 0:52:7,54
I want to see them be
honest and raw and real.


1491
0:52:7,54 --> 0:52:9,59
And maybe it sounds like
what I want to hear.


1492
0:52:9,59 --> 0:52:10,64
But maybe it doesn't.


1493
0:52:10,64 --> 0:52:12,99
And I respect them for that.


1494
0:52:12,99 --> 0:52:16,75
So I like people
to be who they are.


1495
0:52:16,75 --> 0:52:18,792
And the differences are
what make us interesting.


1496
0:52:18,792 --> 0:52:20,166
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: All right.


1497
0:52:20,166 --> 0:52:20,68
Final thing.


1498
0:52:20,68 --> 0:52:21,78
It's a new year.


1499
0:52:21,78 --> 0:52:23,31
Any big goals for this year?


1500
0:52:23,31 --> 0:52:25,624
DANICA PATRICK: To be
the most Googled athlete.


1501
0:52:25,624 --> 0:52:27,79
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON: I
think you already did that.


1502
0:52:27,79 --> 0:52:29,399
You already did that.


1503
0:52:29,399 --> 0:52:30,19
DANICA PATRICK: OK.


1504
0:52:30,19 --> 0:52:32,375
To be the most Googled
athlete at least today.


1505
0:52:32,375 --> 0:52:33,75
CLAIRE HUGHES
JOHNSON: All right.


1506
0:52:33,75 --> 0:52:34,64
I think you're already there.


1507
0:52:34,64 --> 0:52:35,49
DANICA PATRICK: No, I want
the whole one actually.


1508
0:52:35,49 --> 0:52:36,22
CLAIRE HUGHES JOHNSON:
You're all there.


1509
0:52:36,22 --> 0:52:37,63
But any races?


1510
0:52:37,63 --> 0:52:38,32
Anything?


1511
0:52:38,32 --> 0:52:38,987
Any race car driving thing?


1512
0:52:38,987 --> 0:52:39,31
I should ask.


1513
0:52:39,31 --> 0:52:41,851
DANICA PATRICK: I mean, it's my
second year in the Sprint Cup


1514
0:52:41,851 --> 0:52:42,43
Series.


1515
0:52:42,43 --> 0:52:45,1
It by no makes me
a veteran at all.


1516
0:52:45,1 --> 0:52:48,94
But for me it's
about progression.


1517
0:52:48,94 --> 0:52:50,47
And I don't think
that you can ever


1518
0:52:50,47 --> 0:52:53,87
know exactly where you should
be or what you should want.


1519
0:52:53,87 --> 0:52:56,13
And it's good to set goals.


1520
0:52:56,13 --> 0:52:59,42
For me I feel good to just
set progression goals.


1521
0:52:59,42 --> 0:53:0,97
And know that I'm
getting better.


1522
0:53:0,97 --> 0:53:3,22
And when I look back over
the last month, am I better?


1523
0:53:3,22 --> 0:53:5,2
Over the last six
months, am I better?


1524
0:53:5,2 --> 0:53:9,43
And of course my ultimate
