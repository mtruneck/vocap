###0 MORNING. I JUST WANT TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT
###3 THE LAB. MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE BEEN COMING
###6 THROUGH THE LABS AND TALKING TO YOU AND ONE OF THE
###8 THINGS THAT I HAVE NOTICED IS THAT I HAVE TRIED TO
###11 GIVE YOU A SETTING FOR THE EXAM QUESTIONS. AND
###15 SOMETIMES THE EXAM QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO PRESENT YOU
###17 WITH AN INTERMEDIATE STAGE. LIKE YOU MIGHT SAY SPORE,
###21 AND YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD
###24 IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF WHAT COULD COME FROM THAT SPORE.
###26 AND MOVE BACKWARDS WHAT MIGHT HAVE RESULTED IN THE
###30 PRODUCTION OF THAT SPORE. AND I AM TALKING TO SOME OF
###33 YOU I GET THE IMPRESSION THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO
###36 MEMORIZE IT. AND IF YOU TRY TO MEMORIZE IS IT IS
###39 GOING TO BE HARD BECAUSE YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO PUT THIS
###41 IN THE CONTEXT OF YOUR MEMORIZATION. BUT IF YOU
###44 UNDERSTAND IT, YOU WILL BE MUCH BETTER PLACE FOR THE
###46 MIDTERM.
###47 AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO I HAVE SPOKEN TO AND
###49 
###51 CLEARLY MEMORIZING IT, I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT I AM
###54 THERE TO HELP YOU AND TRYING TO IMPRESS UPON YOU THE
###57 IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING NOT MEMORIZING. THOSE OF
###61 YOU WHO TRY TO MEMORIZE WILL REALLY NOT VERY ABLE TO
###64 ANSWER THE QUESTIONS WHEN I CAME THROUGH THE LAB. AND
###66 I GUESS YOU SORT OF SENSED THAT WHEN I TALKED WITH
###69 YOU.
###71 ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS? ALL RIGHT. TODAY
###74 WHAT WE ARE GOING TO START DOING IS TO TALK ABOUT THE
###76 FIRST ORGAN IN THE PLANTS THAT WE ARE ENCOUNTERING.
###79 AN ORGAN IS SOMETHING WHICH IS MADE UP OF A NUMBER OF
###82 DIFFERENT CELL TYPES, A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TISSUE
###85 TYPES. AND THE FIRST ORGAN WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT
###89 BEGINNING TODAY IS THE ROOT SYSTEM. NOW FOR MOST OF
###93 US THE ROOT SYSTEM IS THE PART OF THE PLANT THAT IS,
###97 WE NEVER THINK ABOUT, WE NEVER SEE. IT IS THE PART OF
###100 THE PLANT THAT IS UNDERGROUND, AT LEAST THAT IS YOUR
###102 
###106 SIGHT, OUT OF MIND. I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOME SLIDES TO
###110 ILLUSTRATE TO YOU THAT ROOTS COME IN VERY MANY
###113 DIFFERENT FORMS OTHER THAN WHAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE THE
###116 STEREOTYPICAL FORM BELOW GROUND. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO
###119 BEGIN FIRST BY DISCUSSING SOME OF THE MAIN FUNCTIONS
###122 OF THE ROOT. SOME OF THESE MAIN FUNCTIONS AND WE WILL
###127 DISCUSS SOME OF THEM IN MORE DETAIL TODAY. THE FIRST
###131 ONE IS ANCHORAGE OR SUPPORT. AND YOU WILL SEE SOME
###137 GOOD EXAMPLES OF THIS. ANCHORAGE OR SUPPORT.
###139 THE SECOND, AND IT IS A MAJOR FUNCTION THAT WE
###144 WILL SPEND QUITE A BIT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT IT, IS
###147 ABSORPTION OF WATER AND NUTRIENTS. A THIRD FUNCTION
###159 AMONG THE MANY WHICH ROOTS HAVE AND WHAT WE WILL
###161 BRIEFLY TOUCH UPON TODAY IS THAT THEY CAN BECOME
###163 A STORAGE ORGAN.
###168 AND MANY OF YOU WITHOUT REALIZING THAT IT IS
###171 A ROOT OR REALIZING IT IS A STORAGE ORGAN ENCOUNTER
###173 
###178 ROOT STORAGE ORGANS, CARROTS, BEETS, THESE ARE STORAGE
###182 ORGANS WHERE SUGARS AND STARCHES ARE PLACED IN THE
###186 ROOT SYSTEM AND THEY PROVIDE THE PLANT MATERIAL TO
###189 START GROWING THE FOLLOWING YEAR WHEN THE SPRING COMES
###191 ALONG. WE CAN CONSUME THESE BECAUSE THEY ARE SWEET OR
###194 BECAUSE THEY HAVE STARCH IN THEM.
###196 A LESS COMMON, AT LEAST TO MANY OF YOU ROOT
###198 SYSTEM, IS CASABA. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO COME FROM
###201 TROPICAL CULTURES OR MAYBE EAST ASIAN CULTURES THIS IS
###204 SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD USE. IT REPRESENTS A ROOT
###207 SYSTEM IN WHICH LARGE AMOUNTS OF STARCH HAVE BEEN
###209 STORED.
###211 AN EXAMPLE OF A ROOT SYSTEM WHICH IS NOT STORAGE
###213 BUT ALSO HAS PLAYED PROMINENT ROLES IN MANY CULTURES
###216 PARTICULARLY IN ASIAN CULTURES IS OVER HERE, THIS IS
###220 A ROOT OF A GINSENG. GINSENG SUPPOSEDLY HAS MEDICINAL
###224 PROPERTIES AND THE PROPERTIES OF THE GINSENG ARE
###228 
###232 WHETHER IT HAS BRANCHES. THIS IS SORT OF A CULTURAL
###235 ONE. IT IS A THICKER ROOT. IT IS A STORAGE ROOT, BUT
###238 IT IS MAINLY INVOLVED IN CULTURAL PRACTICES NOT FOR
###241 THEIR STORAGE PROPERTIES. AND FINALLY WHAT I WANT TO
###245 MENTION AS FAR AS THE FUNCTION OF THE ROOTS IS THAT
###248 AND WE PROBABLY WON'T HAVE TIME TO TALK ABOUT IT, BUT
###250 IT IS AN IMPORTANT FUNCTION, IS THAT ROOTS FREQUENTLY
###253 ESTABLISH SYMBIOTIC ASSOCIATIONS WITH SOIL
###262 MICROORGANISMS.
###272 AND, THIS ESTABLISHMENT OF SOIL MICROORGANISMS
###275 BENEFITS BOTH THE ROOT SYSTEM AND THE MICROORGANISM.
###279 WE ARE HAVING SOME PROBLEMS HERE. OKAY. LET'S BEGIN
###283 WITH THE SLIDES, AND I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU SOME
###286 SLIDES NOW TO ILLUSTRATE THE DIVERSITY THAT ROOT
###290 SYSTEMS HAVE BEYOND WHAT YOU NORMALLY ASSOCIATE WITH
###294 A ROOT SYSTEM.
###297 THE FIRST SLIDE IS OF A TROPICAL, THESE ARE
###303 SCREW PINE
###304 OR PANDANUS, AND IN THIS PARTICULAR PLANT THE ROOTS
###308 FORM ON THE STEM AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT, AND THEY
###310 SUPPORT THE PLANT. THEY KEEP IT UPRIGHT AND THEY ALSO
###313 ABSORB WATER ONCE THEY ENTER THE SOIL. HERE IS
###316 ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A ROOT OF A TROPICAL PLANT OF
###319 A RELATED TO THE FIG FAMILY. THESE ARE ACTUALLY ROOTS
###322 HERE. THEY LOOK LIKE BRANCHES, WHAT THEY DO IS THEY
###324 SUPPORT THESE VERY LARGE BRANCHES WHICH ALLOW THIS
###327 TREE TO COVER A LARGE AREA. HERE IS AN EXAMPLES OF
###331 A ROOT SYSTEM IN A, OF A VERY TALL TREE IN THE
###334 TROPICS, AREA WHICH IS RECEIVES VERY HIGH WINDS
###339 OCCASIONALLY. AND THESE ARE SO CALLED BUTTRESS ROOTS,
###342 TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE DIVERSITY OF ROOTS, AND
###344 THEY PROVIDE SORT OF EXTRA SUPPORT FOR THE TREE IN
###347 WINDY WEATHER. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE BEEN TO
###350 FLORIDA OR DOWN TO MEXICO, YOU MAY HAVE ENCOUNTERED
###353 MANGROVE SWAMPS AND IN MANGROVE SWAMPS THE WATER COMES
###357 
###360 SYSTEMS ACT TO ELEVATE THE TREES, THE MANGROVE TREES,
###363 ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE WATER. THE MANGROVE ROOTS CAN
###366 ALSO BE MODIFIED TO GROW UP ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE
###370 WATER AND PROVIDE AN AIR TUBE SO TO SPEAK FOR AIR TO
###373 COME DOWN TO THE ROOT SYSTEM, WHICH OTHERWISE WOULD BE
###375 FLOODED AND WOULDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO OXYGEN. HERE IS
###379 A ROOT SYSTEM THAT MANY OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH, WITH
###381 THE ROOT SYSTEM OF CLIMBING IVY. THIS ROOT SYSTEM
###384 SECRETES A GLUE AND THIS GLUE, IF YOU TRY TO PULL THE
###387 IVY OFF FROM THE BUILDING, FREQUENTLY WILL STAY ON THE
###390 BUILDING, IT STICKS SO TIGHTLY. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO
###393 ARE INTERESTED IN BIOMIMICRY THAT IS USING NATURE TO
###396 DESIGN VARIOUS THINGS, THIS GLUE FOR EXAMPLE WOULD BE
###399 A GOOD START. NO ONE HAS EVER ANALYZED THIS GLUE TO
###402 SEE WHETHER IT IS SOMETHING WE AS HUMANS MIGHT BE ABLE
###406 TO USE IN OUR LIVES.
###408 HERE IS AN INTERESTING ROOT SYSTEM, NOT
###412 ON THE STEM
###413 OF A PALM TREE. AND THESE ROOTS, WHICH GREW OUT OF
###415 THE PALM TREE, STOP GROWING WHEN THEY ARE RELATIVELY
###417 SHORT AND THEY TURN INTO SPINES. AND THIS IS
###420 PRESUMABLY TO PREVENT ANIMALS FROM CLIMBING UP THE
###423 TREE AND EATING THE FRUITS OR THE FLOWERS.
###427 HERE IS A ROOT SYSTEM OF A PLANT WHERE
###429 ESSENTIALLY THE WHOLE BODY OF THE PLANT CONSISTS OF
###431 THE ROOT SYSTEM. EVERYTHING YOU SEE HERE THAT IS
###434 GREEN, AND IN FACT EVEN THIS WHITE STUFF, THIS GREEN
###437 IS ROOT SYSTEM. THE SHOOT SYSTEM IN THIS PLANT HAS
###440 BEEN REDUCED TO A VERY SMALL PORTION OF THE BODY. AND
###443 ALL OF THE BODY THAT YOU SEE HERE, WHICH IS GREEN, IS
###446 THE ROOT SYSTEM AND THE ROOT SYSTEM IS THE
###448 PHOTOSYNTHETIC PART OF THE PLANT. SHOW YOU AGAIN USES
###453 OF ROOTS IN OUR LIVES WHERE WE HAVE CASABA, BEETS AND
###456 CARROTS. THESE ARE STORAGE ROOTS WHICH STORE LARGE
###459 AMOUNTS OF SUGAR AND STARCH. AND FINALLY, I WANT TO
###462 
###464 ALL OVER THE WORLD, ROOT SYSTEMS CAUSE TREMENDOUS
###467 DAMAGE. VERY EXPENSIVE DAMAGE. THIS IS A PICTURE
###470 INSIDE A SEWER. AND MANY OF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED
###474 HAVING YOUR WATER PIPE OR YOUR DRAINS BACKED UP. MOST
###477 OFTEN IF IT IS NOT WITHIN THE HOUSE. IF IT IS OUTSIDE
###480 OF THE HOUSE, IT IS BECAUSE ROOT SYSTEMS HAVE INVADED
###482 THE PIPE AND ARE SUCKING THE MINERALS UP. IN THIS
###486 CASE, IN A SEWER, AND THESE MINERALS THEN ARE
###489 NOURISHING THE PLANT, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I THINK I
###492 WILL LEAVE THIS SCREEN DOWN, SORRY, AT THE SAME TIME,
###494 BLOCKING YOUR, YOUR WATER TO LEAVE. NOW, WHAT I WOULD
###501 LIKE TO DO, IS TO BEGIN A DISCUSSION OF THE
###506 DEVELOPMENT OF THE ROOT SYSTEM. AND I AM GOING TO
###508 LEAVE THIS SCREEN DOWN BECAUSE I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU
###510 MORE SLIDES IN A MOMENT. AND I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN
###512 WITH THE EMBRYO. IN THE EMBRYO THE FIRST ROOT SYSTEM
###516 IS PRESENT. SO, THE FIRST ROOT SYSTEM IS PRESENT IN
###525 
###531 AND WE CALL THAT FIRST ROOT OR ROOT SYSTEM THE
###534 PRIMARY ROOT. IT IS OFTEN REFERRED IN YOUR TEXT BOOK
###541 OR IN COMMON LITERATURE AS A TAP ROOT.
###544 A TAP ROOT.
###550 NOW, IF THIS WAS A EUDICOT THE TAP ROOT GROWS
###559 DOWN. GROWS STRONGLY DOWNWARD.
###566 AND GOES DEEPLY INTO THE SOIL.
###570 SO, YOU WOULD FIND THIS FIRST ROOT, WHICH COMES
###572 FROM THE EMBRYO GROWING DOWN, IT BECOMES PROMINENT,
###576 THE MOST PROMINENT OF THE ROOTS.
###583 IT CAN ALSO PRODUCE BRANCH ROOTS.
###591 AND THESE
###591 BRANCH ROOTS ARE KNOWN AS SECONDARY ROOTS. AS OPPOSED
###594 TO PRIMARY. OR LATERAL ROOTS. ANOTHER TERM.
###601 WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF THE
###607 BRANCH ROOTS AND LATERAL ROOTS IN A FEW MINUTES. THIS
###610 IS WHAT OCCURS IN A EUDICOT. IN A MONOCOT, IN
###616 A MONOCOT EMBRYO, WE ALSO HAVE A PRIMARY ROOT IN THE
###620 
###628 BUT THIS ROOT IS SHORT LIVED. THAT IS, IT
###632 DOESN'T LIVE VERY LONG. AND IS QUICKLY REPLACED BY
###638 SECONDARY ROOTS. I WILL ABBREVIATE SECONDARY WITH
###646 A 2. SECONDARY ROOTS.
###651 THIS DIFFERENCE IN THE ROOT SYSTEMS RESULTS IN
###654 THESE MONOCOTS HAVING A FIBROUS ROOT SYSTEM. FIBROUS
###659 ROOT SYSTEM. AND BECAUSE MONOCOTS PRODUCE
###666 A RELATIVELY SHALLOW FIBROUS ROOT SYSTEM, FOR THOSE OF
###671 YOU WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE OR WHO KNOW OF A FOREST FIRES
###675 OR FIRES WHICH BURN THE LAND, SAY IN SOUTHERN
###678 CALIFORNIA. BEFORE THE WINTER RAINS COME, THE LAND
###681 WHICH HAS BEEN BURNED IS BROADCAST AND COVERED WITH
###683 SEED USUALLY BY HELICOPTERS OF MONOCOT, MONOCOT SEEDS.
###687 AND IT IS HOPED THAT THESE SEEDS WILL GERMINATE AND
###690 BECAUSE OF THE FIBROUS NATURE OF THE ROOT SYSTEMS,
###693 THAT THEY WILL KNIT TOGETHER THE SOIL AND PREVENT
###695 EROSION. SO, THESE ROOT SYSTEMS HAVE A COMMON USE AS
###699 
###703 ROOT SYSTEMS. BECAUSE THEY ARE UNDER GROUND MOST OF
###705 US DON'T REALLY HAVE AN APPRECIATION OF THE SIZE OF
###708 ROOT SYSTEMS. THE RATIO OF SHOOT TO ROOT FREQUENTLY
###713 CHANGES THROUGHOUT THE LIFE OF A PLANT. WHEN A SEED
###716 IS TRYING TO ESTABLISH ITSELF, IT USUALLY HAS MORE
###719 ROOT THAN SHOOT. BECAUSE IT WANTS TO BE ABLE TO GET
###722 LOTS OF WATER AND NUTRIENTS BEFORE IT MAKES A BIG
###725 SHOOT SYSTEM. AS A PLANT AGES AND GETS TO BE AN ADULT
###729 OR MATURE INDIVIDUAL, THE ROOT AND SHOOT SYSTEM COME
###732 INTO BALANCE WITH EACH OTHER, SO THERE IS A ABOUT A 1
###734 TO 1 RATIO BETWEEN THE VEGETABLE MATTER AND THE ROOT
###738 AND THE SHOOT SYSTEM. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE
###739 GARDENERS, WHEN YOU TRANSPLANT THE PLANT AND WHEN YOU
###742 CUT IT OUT OF THE SOIL AND MOVE IT SOMEPLACE ELSE,
###745 WHAT ARE YOU DOING IS ESSENTIALLY SEVERING OR CUTTING
###748 OFF PART OF THE ROOT SYSTEM. YOU ARE CHANGING THAT
###750 RATIO BY CUTTING OFF THE ROOT SYSTEM. AND THAT IS WHY
###754 
###757 OFF SOME OF THE SHOOT SYSTEM AT THE SAME TIME.
###759 TO BETTER KEEP THIS RATIO IN ORDER. SO WHAT I
###763 WOULD LIKE TO DO NOW IS TO SHOW YOU A FEW SLIDES OF
###767 DIFFERENT ROOT SYSTEMS AND SHOW YOU SOMETHING ABOUT
###770 THE PRIMARY ROOTS. HERE IS A SEEDLING OF A RADISH
###775 WHICH HAS JUST GERMINATED AND HERE IS A EUDICOT. HERE
###779 IS THE PRIMARY ROOT. HERE ARE THE COTYLEDONS AND THE
###782 PRIMARY ROOT GROWS STRAIGHT DOWN. THIS IS A, AS
###785 OPPOSED TO THE ROOT SYSTEM OF A MONOCOT. THIS IS A
###788 CORN PLANT. MANY OF YOU HAVE SEEN CORN PLANTS BUT
###790 HAVEN'T REALIZED THAT THESE ARE ROOTS WHICH ARE
###793 FORMING ON THE STEM AND THEY ACTUALLY REPLACE THE
###797 PRIMARY ROOT, WHICH HAS DIED. SO, THAT IF WE COULD
###800 PEEL AWAY THE SOIL FROM A CORN ROOT SYSTEM, WE
###804 WOULDN'T FIND ANY ROOT PARTICULARLY PROMINENT, WE
###807 WOULD FIND A LOT OF ROOTS AT THE SURFACE AND THESE ARE
###809 ALL, THEY ARE NOT PRIMARY ROOTS, THEY ARE ALL
###812 
###814 THEY ARE NOT PRIMARY ROOTS.
###817 THIS IS, AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING LIKE EUDICOT,
###820 IN WHICH THE PRIMARY ROOT IS STILL EVIDENT HERE IN
###822 THIS PARTICULAR PLANT. THIS IS CLOVER, OR ALFALFA AND
###825 YOU CAN SEE THE PRIMARY ROOT GROWING STRAIGHT DOWN.
###828 BUT IT ALSO, THIS ROOT SYSTEM HAS MADE SECONDARIES OR
###830 BRANCH ROOTS ALONG THE SURFACE OF THE SOIL. HERE IS
###834 AN EXAMPLE OF A MATURE INDIVIDUAL, AN APPLE TREE, IN
###836 WHICH THE ROOT SYSTEM WAS EXCAVATED. HERE IS THE
###839 SHOOT SYSTEM, AND TO GIVE YOU SOME IDEA OF THE BIOMASS
###842 THAT IS IN THE ROOT SYSTEM, THIS EXCAVATION, NOTICE
###846 THAT THE ROOT SYSTEM HAS FREQUENTLY MORE EXTENSIVE,
###848 GOES OUT FURTHER THAN THE SHOOT SYSTEM DOES. AND
###851 PERHAPS THE BEST EXAMPLE I CAN SHOW YOU OF THAT, OF
###854 THE EXTENT OF THE ROOT SYSTEM, THIS IS TAKEN DOWN IN
###856 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN THE DESERT. HERE IS AN
###858 INDIVIDUAL OVER HERE AND HE HAS EXCAVATED A ROOT
###863 
###865 THAT THE ROOT SYSTEMS CAN HAVE QUITE EXTENSIVE AREAS
###869 THAT THEY COVER AND DEPENDING UPON THE ENVIRONMENT IN
###871 WHICH THE PLANT IS GROWING, THEY CAN COVER
###873 CONSIDERABLE AREAS.
###875 SO, THESE ARE THE ROOT SYSTEMS AS FAR AS THEIR
###878 DIVERSITY, AS FAR AS THEIR COVERAGE.
###881 AND NOW WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TO BEGIN TO
###885 TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ROOT DEVELOPMENT. AND,
###888 THIS WILL BE A SETTING FOR SOME OF THE GROWTH AND
###890 DEVELOPMENT THAT WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT LATER IN THE
###892 CLASS. AND, FOR THIS PARTICULAR INTRODUCTION, I HAVE
###898 BROUGHT A MODEL ALONG, AND YOU WILL HAVE THIS SAME
###900 MODEL IN THE CLASS. AND WHAT I WANT TO POINT OUT TO
###903 YOU ON THIS MODEL IS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THE
###906 MODEL AND THIS IS REALLY PRETTY GOOD FOR OUR CLASS,
###909 HAVE DIVIDED THE ROOT SYSTEM INTO TWO PARTS; INTO THIS
###912 KIND OF GRAYISH PART, WHICH IS AT THE TIP AND THIS
###915 
###917 WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TO TALK ABOUT THESE
###919 TWO PORTIONS. AND WE WILL BEGIN FIRST WITH THE GRAY
###922 PART. SO LET ME FIRST MAKE A SECTION DOWN THROUGH THE
###927 CENTER OF THIS ROOT. A SECTION, WHICH IS A
###929 LONGITUDINAL SECTION, WHICH IS ON THIS SIDE HERE. WE
###932 ARE GOING TO CUT THAT LONGITUDINALLY AND I AM GOING TO
###934 DRAW THAT SECTION FOR YOU UP HERE ON THE BOARD. SO,
###938 HERE IS A LONG STUDENT SIGNAL SECTION OF A ROOT. WE
###947 ARE GOING TO DRAW THESE TWO MAIN TISSUES THAT ARE
###951 ILLUSTRATED BY THIS MODEL HERE.
###955 THE GRAY TISSUE TOWARD THE BACK OR TOWARD THE
###957 BOTTOM, IS A TISSUE WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ROOT CAP.
###965 AND THE DARKER TISSUE, WHICH COMPRISES MOST OF THE
###968 MODEL OVER HERE, IS THE MAIN ROOT BODY.
###975 MAIN ROOT BODY. AND I WANT TO PUT ONE MORE
###978 LANDMARK ON THIS PICTURE BECAUSE WE WILL BE REFERRING
###980 TO IT AS WE GO THROUGH THE TALK TODAY. AND THAT
###983 
###987 WHICH IS THE REGION OF THE ROOT APICAL MERISTEM. AND
###1002 NOW WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TO BEGIN TO TALK TO YOU
###1004 ABOUT THOSE TWO MAIN TISSUES WHICH COMPRISE THE ROOT.
###1008 THE MAIN BODY OF THE ROOT, AND THE ROOT CAP. AND
###1010 LET'S BEGIN FIRST WITH THE ROOT CAP. THE ROOT CAP HAS
###1016 A NUMBER OF REMARKABLE FUNCTIONS. THE FIRST FUNCTION
###1021 IS THAT IT PROTECTS THE ROOT MERISTEM AS THE ROOT
###1033 ADVANCES THROUGH THE SOIL.
###1041 JUST LIKE IN THE SHOOT
###1042 WHERE WE SAID THERE WERE EITHER THE BENDING OF THE
###1045 EPICOTYL OR THE HYPOCOTYL OR A SHEATH COVERING THE
###1048 SHOOT APICAL MERISTEM, THIS ROOT CAP COVERS THE ROOT
###1052 APICAL MERISTEM AND PROTECTS IT AS THE ROOT GROWS
###1056 THROUGH THE SOIL. ANOTHER RELATIVELY INTERESTING
###1060 FUNCTION AND AGAIN SOMETHING WHICH WE HAVEN'T
###1062 EXPLOITED, WE HAVEN'T REALLY ANALYZED, IS TA IS ROOT
###1065 SYSTEM OR THE ROOT CAP SECRETES A LUBRICANT. AND THIS
###1073 LUBRICANT IS THOUGHT TO HELP OR EASE THE PASSAGE OF
###1077 
###1081 THE MANY, WHICH THE ROOT CAP DOES, AND WHICH WE CAN
###1083 ONLY TALK ABOUT TODAY, A THIRD FUNCTION IS THAT THE
###1086 ROOT CAP IS THE SITE OF PERCEPTION OF GRAVITY. IT IS
###1096 THE SITE WHERE GRAVITY IS PERCEIVED IN THE ROOT
###1099 SYSTEM. IN OTHER WORDS THE ACTIVITIES OF THE CAP
###1109 ALLOW A ROOT TO ORIENT TO GRAVITY. AND I WOULD LIKE
###1121 TO DISCUSS WITH YOU BRIEFLY HOW THIS OCCURS, BECAUSE
###1124 IT IS REALLY QUITE A REMARKABLE SYSTEM. I WILL DRAW
###1128 FOR YOU ON THIS PARTICULAR DIAGRAM JUST THE ROOT CAP.
###1132 NOT THE MAIN BODY. SO THE ROOT IS HERE AND HERE IS
###1136 THE CAP. AND I WANT TO PUT A COUPLE OF CELLS IN THIS
###1142 CAP, WHICH ARE INVOLVED, WE BELIEVE, IN THE PERCEPTION
###1145 OF GRAVITY. AND I AM JUST GOING TO MAKE TWO OF THEM,
###1147 ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MORE OF THEM IN THE CAP. THESE
###1151 CELLS ARE CALLED STATOCYTES. AND IF WE COULD LOOK AT
###1159 ONE OF THESE CELLS MORE CAREFULLY IN HIGHER POWER,
###1163 A HIGHER POWER VIEW, WE WOULD FIND THAT ON THEIR
###1167 
###1175 WOULD HAVE COLLECTIONS OF MEMBRANE-BOUND STARCH
###1187 GRAINS. MEMBRANE-BOUND STARCH GRAINS WHICH HAVE
###1194 COLLECTED ON THE BOTTOM SURFACE OF THE STATOCYTE.
###1200 THESE MEMBRANE-BOUND STARCH GRAINS ARE GIVEN
###1203 A NAME. THEY ARE CALLED AMYLOPLAST. AND NOW I WOULD
###1210 LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW WE THINK THE AMYLOPLAST
###1215 ARE INVOLVED IN THE PERCEPTION OF THE GRAVITY VECTOR.
###1221 YOU NOTICE THAT I SAID THAT THE AMYLOPLAST ARE ON THE
###1223 LOWER MOST SURFACE OF THE PARTICULAR STATOCYTE THAT
###1226 THEY ARE IN. THEY ARE ON THE LOWER MOST SURFACE
###1229 BECAUSE THEY ARE HEAVY. THEY ARE DENSE. SO, LET'S
###1232 TAKE A STATOCYTE AND WE WILL ONLY LOOK AT ONE
###1235 STATOCYTE HERE. IT IS IN THE CAP. AND WE ARE GOING
###1238 TO CALL THIS SIDE OF THE ROOT A, OF THE STATOCYTE A,
###1244 AND THIS SIDE B. AND AT TIME ZERO, THE ROOT IS IN
###1252 THIS PARTICULAR ORIENTATION LIKE SO, AND NOW WE ARE
###1256 GOING TO DO IS TAKE THE ROOT AND TURN IT ON ITS SIDE.
###1261 
###1266 ON ITS SIDE THE NEW LOWER SURFACE IS GOING TO BE B AND
###1274 A IS GOING TO BE OVER HERE. AND WHAT IS GOING TO
###1280 HAPPEN IS THAT THESE STARCH GRAINS ARE GOING TO FALL
###1285 TO THE NEW LOWER SURFACE. AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS
###1290 THE MOVEMENT OF THESE STARCH GRAINS TO THE LOWER MOST
###1294 SURFACE WHICH ACTUALLY ACCOUNTS FOR BOTH THE
###1298 PERCEPTION OF GRAVITY AND ULTIMATELY WITH TIME THE
###1304 REORIENTATION OF THE ROOT TO THE GRAVITY VECTOR. THIS
###1307 IS A VERY INTERESTING MECHANISM. IT WAS STUDIED BY
###1311 DARWIN AND HIS SON FRANCIS AND THEY HAVE WRITTEN
###1313 A LARGE NUMBER OF PAPERS ON THIS PARTICULAR SYSTEM AND
###1317 IT REALLY FASCINATED THEM. AND DARWIN WAS ONE OF THE
###1320 FIRST TO APPRECIATE THIS PARTICULAR ACTIVITY WHICH
###1323 WENT ON IN THE ROOT. NOW, IF YOU TAKE OFF THE ROOT
###1327 CAP OF A ROOT, WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN? WELL,
###1331 IF YOU TAKE OFF THE CAP OF A ROOT IT, YOU WILL SEE IN
###1334 A SLIDE THAT I SHOW YOU, IT DOESN'T RESPOND TO GRAVITY
###1336 
###1339 VECTOR IS. AND NASA HAS ACTUALLY TAKEN ROOT SYSTEMS
###1343 AND THEY HAVE TAKEN THEM UP INTO THE SPACE SHUTTLE OR
###1345 INTO THE SPACE STATIONS AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS, WHICH
###1349 WAY WOULD THE ROOT SYSTEM GROW. ANYBODY HAVE ANY IDEA
###1352 WHICH WAY THE ROOT SYSTEM WOULD GROW IN THE
###1354 MICROGRAVITY OR GRAVITY?
###1357 ANY IDEAS? EVERYWHERE. THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT.
###1361 IT GROWS EVERYWHERE. THERE IS NOTHING FOR IT, RANDOM,
###1363 NOTHING FOR IT TO PICK UP ON BUT IN FACT WHAT IT DOES
###1366 PICK UP ON AS THE ASTRONAUTS WALK AROUND THE SPACE
###1369 SHUTTLE OR THE SPACE STATION THEY IMPART SMALL MONTH
###1372 MEN TA AND THE ROOTS ARE ABLE TO PICK THAT UP AND SO
###1375 THEY DO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF PERCEPTION, BUT MOSTLY
###1378 THEY GROW EVERY DIRECTION BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE
###1380 ANYWAY OF SEDIMENTING THEIR STARCH GRAINS. NOW, WHAT
###1384 I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TO SPEND SOME TIME LOOKING AT
###1387 THE MAIN BODY OF THE ROOT. THIS OTHER PORTION OF THE
###1390 
###1396 ROOT, THE CAP IS ONLY A VERY TINY PART. AND LET'S
###1399 MAKE ANOTHER DRAWING OF THAT SAME ROOT, WHICH WE HAD
###1402 BEFORE. AND THE POINTS I WANT TO MAKE TO YOU ARE THE
###1405 FOLLOWING: WE HAVE THE MERISTEM, WHICH WE SAID WAS
###1413 A ZONE OF HIGH DIVISION. THAT IS WHERE CELLS ARE
###1416 BEING PRODUCED. IF WE GO A LITTLE FURTHER BACK ON THE
###1420 ROOT WE FIND WE HAVE CELLS ELONGATING. CELLS
###1427 ELONGATING. AND IF WE GO EVEN FURTHER BACK IN THE
###1432 ROOT WE FIND THAT THE CELLS ARE DIFFERENTIATING. THAT
###1441 IS, THEY ARE BECOMING THE VARIOUS CELL TYPES THAT WE
###1444 TALKED ABOUT BEFORE, COLLENCHYMA, FIBERS AND XYLEM AND
###1448 PHLOEM. NOW, BECAUSE THESE 3 DIFFERENT EVENTS OCCUR
###1454 WITHIN A SINGLE ROOT, DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGISTS HAVE
###1458 BEEN USING ROOTS FOR STUDIES FOR A LONG TIME. BECAUSE
###1461 IN A SINGLE ORGAN YOU CAN HAVE CELLS DIVIDING,
###1465 ENLARGING AND UNDERGOING A STATE OF DIFFERENTIATION
###1467 ALL AT THE SAME TIME. AND SO, ROOT SYSTEMS HAVE
###1470 
###1473 BIOLOGISTS BECAUSE ALL OF THESE EVENTS GO ON WITHIN
###1476 A SINGLE PLANT, A SINGLE ROOT SYSTEM. NOW WHAT I
###1480 WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TO TAKE THIS ROOT SYSTEM, WHICH WE
###1485 HAVE DRAWN AND LONGITUDINAL SECTION AND TO LOOK AT IT
###1488 IN CROSS SECTION, TO MAKE A CROSS SECTION OF THIS
###1491 ROOT. YOU WILL HAVE THIS MODEL IN THE LAB, YOU ARE
###1494 ALSO GOING TO HAVE A MICROSCOPE SLIDES TO ALLOW YOU TO
###1497 LOOK AT THESE VARIOUS CELL TYPES, BUT WHAT I WOULD
###1499 LIKE TO DO IS TO PUT THE LANDMARKS OF THE CELL TYPES
###1502 ON NOW IN A DRAWING BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO BE SEEING
###1505 THEM IN THE LAB, I THINK NEXT WEEK. SO, LET'S NOW
###1510 BEGIN WITH A CROSS SECTION, A CROSS SECTION OF
###1515 A TYPICAL EUDICOT ROOT. WE ARE MAKING A CUT ACROSS
###1524 THE ROOT. AND WE WILL BEGIN WITH A ROUND PICTURE
###1530 WHICH IS THE CROSS SECTION OF THE ROOT AND LET'S START
###1533 WITH A COUPLE OF LANDMARKS FOR OUR DISCUSSION, IN THE
###1538 VERY CENTER OF THE ROOT IS THE VASCULAR TISSUE, THAT
###1544 
###1550 TALKED ABOUT BEFORE. AND HAS VARIOUS ARRANGEMENTS AND
###1554 YOU WILL SEE SOME OF THE ARRANGEMENTS IN THE SLIDES
###1556 THAT I SHOW YOU AND ALSO IN THE LAB. AT THE VERY
###1560 OUTSIDE YOU HAVE THE EPIDERMIS. AND YOU MIGHT EVEN
###1565 HAVE A ROOT HERE.
###1572 THE MAJOR BODY OF THE ROOT, THE
###1573 MAJOR CELLS OF THE ROOT ARE IN THIS REGION HERE AND
###1579 THEY ARE THE CORTEX. THEY ARE MOSTLY PARENCHYMA
###1583 CELLS. MOSTLY PARENCHYMA CELLS AND THEY FUNCTION IN
###1594 STORAGE. THAT IS WHAT MAKES UP THE BODY OF THESE
###1596 ROOTS, MOSTLY PARENCHYMA CELLS. THEY FUNCTION IN
###1598 STORAGE OF STARCH AND SUGARS. NOW WE HAVE ONLY A TWO
###1602 MORE REAL IMPORTANT CELL TYPES TO PUT ON HERE FOR
###1604 DISCUSSION TODAY. AT THIS POINT OVER HERE THE
###1609 INNER-MOST LAYER OF THE CORTEX, INNER MOST LAYER OF
###1617 THE CORTEX IS GIVEN A SPECIAL NAME. AND IT IS GOING
###1621 TO FIGURE PROMINENTLY IN A MOMENT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT
###1624 HOW ROOTS FUNCTION. THAT INNER MOST LAYER IS CALLED
###1627 
###1638 AND THE LAST LAYER
###1639 WHICH I AM GOING TO PUT ON FOR YOU HERE IS THE LAYER
###1645 DIRECTLY INSIDE THE ENDODERMIS.
###1650 A LAYER DIRECTLY INSIDE THE ENDODERMIS THAT IS
###1657 THE LAST LAYER YOU HAVE TO KNOW.
###1660 AND THAT LAYER INDIRECTLY INSIDE THE ENDODERMIS
###1662 IS CALLED THE PARACYCLE. NOW WHY IS THE PARACYCLE
###1675 IMPORTANT? WHY AM I POINTING IT OUT TO YOU? THE
###1678 PARACYCLE IS THE SITE OF ORIGIN OF THE BRANCH ROOT OF
###1689 THE LATERAL BRANCH ROOTS.
###1699 IT IS THE PLACE WHERE WE
###1701 FIND THAT LATERALS ARE PRODUCED AND WHERE THEY
###1705 ORIGINATE AND THEY HAVE AN IMPORTANT FUNCTION AS FAR
###1709 AS INCREASING THE SURFACE AREA OF THE ROOT. WE WILL
###1713 TALK ABOUT THE LATERALS A LITTLE LATER ON TODAY. NOW,
###1716 WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TO SHOW YOU SOME PICTURES
###1719 OF THESE VARIOUS ITEMS THAT I HAVE JUST BRIEFLY
###1721 INTRODUCED YOU TO. THE FIRST PICTURE IS GOING TO BE
###1725 OF A ROOT WHICH IS SORT OF IN PREPARED TWO WAYS. ON
###1728 
###1731 ROOT, AND ON THE RIGHT IS A WHOLE ROOT, THEY HAVE SORT
###1735 OF BEEN PUT TOGETHER IN A SINGLE PICTURE. HERE IS THE
###1737 BODY OF THE ROOT, AND HERE IS THE ROOT CAP. AND WHAT
###1740 I WANT TO POINT OUT TO YOU IS THIS SORT OF TRANSLUCENT
###1743 TYPE OF MATERIAL HERE. THIS IS THE LUBRICANT WHICH
###1747 COMES FROM THE ROOT AND FROM THE ROOT CAP, AND WHICH
###1749 IS USED IN HELPING THE ROOT GET THROUGH THE SOIL.
###1752 NOW, HERE IS THE SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE TAKEN A CORN
###1754 SEEDLING AND THE ROOT WAS ORIGINALLY GROWING DOWN.
###1757 AND WE NOW REORIENTED IT AT 90 DEGREES AND THIS
###1760 REPRESENTS TIME ON THIS AXIS. AND AS TIME GOES ON YOU
###1765 NOTICE THAT THE ROOT SYSTEM IS PRECEDING GRAVITY AND
###1768 AS IT IS GROWING IT IS REORIENTING WITH REGARD, SO
###1771 THAT ITS ORIGINAL ORIENTATION WITH REGARD TO THE
###1773 GRAVITY VECTOR HAS BEEN RESTORED. THIS IS BECAUSE THE
###1776 AMYLOPLAST NOW HAS FALLEN TO THE NEW SURFACE AND HAS
###1780 STARTED THE PROCESS TO THE DETECTION OF GRAVITY AND
###1783 
###1786 THE ROOT. AS A CONTRAST WITH AN EXAMPLE HERE IN WHICH
###1790 THE ROOT CAP IS TAKEN OFF PRIOR TO THE TIME THE ROOT
###1793 IS REORIENTED, IT IS THEN REORIENTED AND THE ROOT
###1796 CONTINUES TO GROW ALONG BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE A CAP
###1799 NOW TO INDICATE WHERE THE GRAVITY VECTOR IS LOCATED.
###1804 TO GIVE YOU A SORT OF SOME CARTOONS OR BETTER VIEWS OF
###1806 THESE STATOCYTES, AS I SAID THERE ARE MORE THAN TWO IN
###1808 THE CAP. HERE ARE THE STATOCYTES. HERE ARE THE
###1812 AMYLOPLAST THESE ARE MEMBRANE-BOUND STARCH GRAINS. IF
###1815 WE CHANGE THE ORIENTATION OF THE ROOT, THAT IS OF THE
###1819 STATOCYTE, THEY FALL TO A NEW LOWER SURFACE AND THAT
###1822 IS HOW THE ROOT DETECTS THE NEW DIRECTION. AND THIS
###1824 IS JUST WHAT WE DRAW UP ON THE BOARD BEFORE WHERE WE
###1827 HAVE THE SURFACE WHICH IS HERE. WE NOW REORIENT THE
###1831 ROOT 90'S DEGREES AND THE STARCH GRAINS WHICH WERE
###1833 RESTING OR COLLECTING ON THIS SURFACE NOW COLLECT ON
###1837 THIS NEW LOWER SURFACE NOW AND COLLECT ON THIS NEW
###1839 
###1840 BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS FOR NOTING THAT THE GRAVITY
###1844 VECTOR HAS CHANGED IN ITS DIRECTION. HERE ARE SOME
###1847 AMYLOPLAST, THE ELCTROMICROGRAPH TO SHOW WHAT THEY
###1850 LOOK LIKE. EACH OF THESE DARK BODIES IS A STARCH
###1852 GRAIN AND YOU CAN SEE THE MEMBRANE, THE
###1854 ELECTROMICROGRAPH MEMBRANE SURROUNDING THIS COLLECTION
###1857 OF STARCH GRAINS, WHICH MAKES THEM VERY DENSE. CROSS
###1861 SECTION OF A TYPICAL DICOT ROOT, THE VASCULAR TISSUE,
###1864 THE XYLEM AND PHLOEM ARE IN THE MIDDLE AND I WILL SHOW
###1866 YOU A HIGHER POWER OF IT IN A MOMENT. MOST OF THE
###1868 ROOT IS MADE UP OF CORTEX AND THESE PURPLE CELLS ARE
###1871 DYED PURPLE BECAUSE OF THE STARCH, WHICH IS IN THE
###1874 CORTEX. WE HAVE THE EPIDERMIS ALONG THE OUTSIDE AND
###1877 NOW IF WE LOOK AT THAT CENTER PORTION WITH A LITTLE
###1879 MORE DETAIL THIS LAYER OF CELLS WITH THE RED ON IT IS
###1883 THE ENDODERMIS. AND DIRECTIONALLY INSIDE, BY
###1886 DEFINITION, IS THE PARACYCLE. THAT LAYER OF CELLS IN
###1889 
###1892 VASCULAR TISSUE. THE XYLEM AND THE PHLOEM AND WE WILL
###1894 TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE MORE.
###1896 WHEN THE LATERAL ROOTS GROW OUT, THEY GROW OUT
###1899 IN A PATTERN, THEY HAVE TO PUSH THEIR WAY THROUGH THE
###1902 CORTEX. HERE IS THE PARACYCLE WHERE THEY ORIGINATE
###1905 FROM AND THEY HAVE TO PUSH THEIR WAY THROUGH THE
###1907 CORTEX, ESSENTIALLY DISSOLVING THE CELL WALLS OF THE
###1911 CORTEX UNTIL THE LATERAL ROOT FINALLY MAKES IT OUT TO
###1914 THE SURFACE AND THEN BEGINS TO FUNCTION AS A ROOT ON
###1917 ITS OWN. OKAY. SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE LANDMARKS,
###1922 SORT OF THE GENERALIZED CHARACTERISTICS AND ACTIVITIES
###1924 OF ROOTS.
###1926 NOW WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS SPEND THE LAST 20
###1928 MINUTES OF TODAY TALKING TO YOU ABOUT PROBABLY THE
###1931 MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF THE ROOT. AND THAT
###1933 IMPORTANT FUNCTION HAS TO DO WITH WATER AND NUTRIENT
###1936 UPTAKE. AND I WANT TO BEGIN BY SAYING A ROOT IS
###1940 
###1942 GROWING IN THE SOIL AND IT IS EXPOSED TO LOTS OF
###1947 DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE SOIL. MANY OF THE THINGS THAT
###1949 ARE IN THE SOIL SURROUNDING THE ROOT SYSTEM THE CARROT
###1952 WANTS NITROGEN, MAGNESIUM, CALCIUM, THESE ARE ALL
###1956 IMPORTANT ELEMENTS FOR THE CARROT TO BE ABLE TO
###1958 SURVIVE. BUT, THERE ARE A LOT OF TOXIC COMPOUNDS IN
###1961 THE SOIL. A LOT OF COMPOUNDS IN THE SOIL THAT THE
###1963 CARROT DOESN'T WANT. IT DOESN'T WANT SALT, IT DOESN'T
###1966 WANT SODIUM. SODIUM IS BAD FOR ITS SYSTEM. SO THE
###1969 QUESTION IS, HOW IS THIS ROOT SYSTEM ABLE TO
###1972 DISCRIMINATE TO FUNCTION, TO TAKE IN MINERALS WHICH
###1975 ARE BENEFICIAL, BUT TO EXCLUDE THOSE TOXINS OR
###1979 POTENTIALLY TOXIC ELEMENTS OR OTHER COMPOUNDS IN THE
###1982 SOIL WHICH WOULD NOT BE SUITABLE FOR THE GROWTH OF THE
###1985 ROOT. WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS AND IN ORDER TO
###1988 CONSIDER THIS TOPIC, I WANT TO DRAW FOR YOU A COUPLE
###1994 MORE LANDMARKS THAT WE WILL BE DISCUSSING AND TO
###1997 
###2001 ROOT THAT WE HAVE ALREADY HAD. SO, WE WILL NOW MAKE
###2003 ANOTHER CROSS SECTION OF A ROOT. AGAIN, BUT WE ARE
###2007 GOING TO DO IT IN HIGH POWER AND WE ARE GOING TO DO IT
###2009 ONLY WITH A FEW CELLS. ON THIS SIDE WE ARE GOING TO
###2013 HAVE THE VASCULAR TISSUE, IN THE VARIOUS CENTER, SO
###2016 THIS IS THE XYLEM AND THE PHLOEM. THEN WE ARE GOING
###2023 TO HAVE AS WE MOVE OUT THE CELLS THAT WE NEED TO KNOW.
###2025 WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE ENDODERMIS AND THEN WE ARE
###2031 GOING TO HAVE, I WILL JUST MAKE ONE LAYER HERE RIGHT
###2034 NOW, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A NUMBER OF CELLS OF THE
###2039 CORTEX. AND THEN FINALLY, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE
###2045 EPIDERMIS.
###2050 NOW, IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS ROOT IS
###2053 ABLE TO TAKE IN ONLY THOSE THINGS THAT IT WANTS TO
###2056 TAKE IN, AND EXCLUDE THOSE THAT IT DOESN'T WANT, WE
###2059 HAVE TO PUT A FEW MORE THINGS ON HERE FOR YOU. THE
###2062 FIRST THING THAT WE NEED TO PUT ON AND THEN OUT HERE
###2065 
###2068 PUT ON THIS, WHICH IS IMPORTANT, IS THAT EACH OF THESE
###2071 CELLS WHICH MAKE UP THE ROOT HAVE A MEMBRANE. SO,
###2086 THIS IS A MEMBRANE. VERY IMPORTANT. AND IF WE COULD
###2093 LOOK WITH WITH AN ELECTROMICROGRAPH, AND I WILL SHOW
###2096 YOU SOME PICTURES OF THESE ELECTROMICROGRAPHS IN
###2097 A MOMENT, WE WOULD NOTICE THAT RUNNING BETWEEN CELLS
###2107 ARE TINY PORES.
###2113 TINY PORES.
###2115 WE CAN'T SEE THESE PORES WITH OUR EYE, WE NEED
###2117 AN ELECTROMICROSCOPE TO BE ABLE TO VISUALIZE THESE
###2119 PORES. BUT, IF YOU WERE A MOLECULE, IF YOU WERE AN
###2124 ATOM OR A MOLECULE OF SAY A CALCIUM, TO YOU THESE
###2129 PORES WOULD LOOK GIANT. THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO, THEY
###2132 WOULD BE LIKE FREEWAYS, YOU COULD MOVE THROUGH THEM
###2134 WITHOUT ANY, ANY PROBLEMS AT ALL.
###2136 THESE PORES ARE, AS I SAID, VIEWED ONLY WITH THE
###2142 ELECTROMICROSCOPE AND THEY ARE CALLED PLASMODESMATA.
###2152 SHORTLY.
###2155 NOW WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS AN EXPERIMENT. AND IN
###2158 THIS EXPERIMENT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS WE ARE
###2161 GOING TO HAVE A SOLUTION WITH WATER, DOESN'T MAKE ANY
###2167 DIFFERENCE, AND IN TO THIS SOLUTION OF WATER WE ARE
###2170 GOING TO DISSOLVE TWO COMPOUNDS. WE WILL CALL THEM A
###2173 AND B. A AND B. AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO PUT A PLANT
###2182 IN THIS WATER WITH ITS ROOT SYSTEM, IN THIS WATER, AND
###2186 ITS GOING TO SIT IN THERE AND WE ARE GOING TO ALLOW
###2188 FOR SOME TIME TO PASS. ALLOW FOR SOME TIME TO PASS.
###2196 SO HERE WE HAVE THIS PLANT SITTING IN THE WATER
###2199 WHICH HAS A AND B IN IT. AND NOW SOME TIME HAS PASSED
###2203 AND WE ARE GOING TO ASK WHAT IS HAPPENED TO A AND B.
###2207 WHERE ARE THEY? WHERE DID THEY GO INTO THIS
###2209 PARTICULAR PLANT? LET'S SAY FOR THIS EXAMPLE WHAT WE
###2213 FIND IS THAT A MAKES IT ALL OF THE WAY TO THE TOP OF
###2218 THE PLANT. IF WE LOOK FOR B WHERE DID B GO, B IS
###2224 CONFINED. IT APPEARS TO BE CONFINED TO THE ROOT
###2231 
###2231 IT IS CONFINED TO THE ROOT SYSTEM.
###2240 NOW, IN ORDER TO EXAMINE THIS A LITTLE MORE
###2243 CAREFULLY TO SEE WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE ROOT SYSTEM,
###2246 I AM GOING TO DRAW THIS AGAIN. NOT QUITE AS DETAILED,
###2251 BUT I AM GOING TO PUT SEVERAL LAYERS ON THIS ONE FOR
###2253 YOU. SO, WE WILL START OUT AGAIN WITH THE VASCULAR
###2257 TISSUE AND NOW WE HAVE SEVERAL LAYERS OF ENDODERMIS
###2262 AND NOW I AM GOING TO PUT ON SEVERAL LAYERS OF CORTEX.
###2268 AND THE EPIDERMIS. HERE IS ANOTHER EPIDERMAL CELL.
###2271 SO IT IS THE SAME THING YOU SAW BEFORE. NOW I AM GOING
###2273 TO PUT SEVERAL LAYERS OF CELLS ON. LIKE SO.
###2278 SAME THING, THIS IS A CROSS SECTION OF A ROOT.
###2285 AND NOW LET'S LOOK TO SEE WHERE A AND B ARE IN THIS
###2288 PARTICULAR ROOT, IN WHICH THAT PLANT HAS SHOWN US THAT
###2292 A HAS GOTTEN ALL OF THE WAY TO THE TOP. IF WE LOOK TO
###2296 SEE WHERE A IS, WE FIND THAT A IS INSIDE THE CELL OF
###2302 THE EPIDERMIS INSIDE ALL OF THE CORTEX CELLS. INSIDE
###2308 
###2313 VASCULAR TISSUE. THAT SEEMS LOGICAL BECAUSE A IS
###2316 CLEAR UP AT THE TOP OF THE PLANT. THIS PATHWAY THAT A
###2324 HAS TAKEN, THIS PATHWAY THAT A HAS TAKEN IN ORDER, WE
###2330 ARE WRITING THIS DOWN TO YOU, THIS PATHWAY OF A
###2342 INVOLVES CROSSING A MEMBRANE.
###2355 SO, LET'S GO BACK TO
###2357 THIS BIG PICTURE THAT I DREW OVER HERE AND IN ORDER
###2360 FOR A TO GET INSIDE OF THIS CELL IT HAD TO CROSS THE
###2365 MEMBRANE. THIS IS THE CRITICAL PART OF WHEN THE PLANT
###2370 DECIDES TO MAKE A CHOICE. IF IT ALLOWS A TO CROSS THE
###2376 MEMBRANE ITS MAKING A CHOICE. IT IS SAYING, I WANT
###2379 YOU A, I WANT YOU TO COME IN, WHATEVER YOU HAPPEN TO
###2381 BE. ONCE A ENTERS THOUGH, KEEP IN MIND IT NOW HAS
###2387 FREE ACCESS TO ALL OF THE CELLS THROUGH THE PORES.
###2392 FREE ACCESS AND IT CAN GO ALL OF THE WAY TO THE
###2395 CENTRAL PORTION BY PASSING THROUGH THE PORES. ANY
###2398 QUESTIONS ON THAT? AN IMPORTANT POINT.
###2402 THIS PATHWAY, THIS PATHWAY WHICH IS INSIDE
###2426 THE SYMPLASTIC
###2428 PATHWAY.
###2434 SYMPLASTIC PATHWAY.
###2437 ONCE AN ION ENTERS A SYMPLASTIC PATHWAY, THIS
###2450 PATHWAY, IT HAS ACCESS TO THE ENTIRE PLANT.
###2468 NOTICE THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO CROSS THE
###2471 MEMBRANE HERE, IT CAN CROSS THE MEMBRANE OVER HERE,
###2474 BUT WHENEVER IT CROSSES A MEMBRANE, ONCE IT GETS
###2477 ACROSS IT HAS ACCESS TO THE ENTIRE PLANT. THAT IS AN
###2480 IMPORTANT PATHWAY. NOW, LET'S LOOK TO SEE WHAT
###2483 HAPPENED WITH B. WE SAID B DIDN'T MAKE IT UP TO THE
###2486 TOP OF THE PLANT. LET'S SEE WHERE B IS IN THE ROOT
###2489 THOUGH. IF WE FOLLOW B WHAT WE FIND IS THAT B IS
###2494 LOCATED IN THESE SPACES BETWEEN CELLS. THESE SPACES
###2498 ARE KNOWN AS INTERCELLULAR SPACES.
###2507 AND IF WE HAD A
###2508 ELECTROMICROSCOPE WE WOULD ALSO FIND THAT B IS IN THE
###2511 CELL WALL. IT IS IN THE CELL WALL. B IS IN THE CELL
###2520 WALL. TO US THE CELL WALL MAY SEEM TO BE VERY SOLID.
###2524 BUT, TO A SMALL MOLECULE THE CELL WALL IS A MESH. IT
###2527 
###2530 FOLLOW B WE FIND THAT IT IS IN THE CELL WALLS, IT IS
###2534 IN THE INTRACELLULAR SPACES, IT GETS ALL OF THE WAY TO
###2539 THE ENDODERMIS IN THE ROOT SYSTEM. ALL OF THE WAY TO
###2542 THE ENDODERMIS. AND THEN IT IS STOPPED. IT CANNOT GO
###2546 ANY FURTHER.
###2556 THE PATHWAY WHICH INVOLVES THE INTRACELLULAR
###2559 SPACES AND THE CELL WALLS DOES NOT INVOLVE CROSSING
###2564 ANY MEMBRANES SO THE PATHWAY INVOLVING INTRACELLULAR
###2573 SPACES IS NOT INVOLVED IN CROSSING A MEMBRANE.
###2589 SO, WE GIVE A SEPARATE NAME TO THIS SECOND
###2599 PATHWAY, WHICH INCLUDES THE INTRACELLULAR SPACES AND
###2602 THE CELL WALL. WE CALL THIS THE APPLEPLAST OR THE
###2607 APPLEPLASTIC PATHWAY.
###2616 SO, THE PLANT DIDN'T WANT B, IT
###2619 DECIDED NOT TO ALLOW B TO CROSS THE MEMBRANE. BUT, B
###2623 WAS ABLE TO FUSE INTO THE ROOT SYSTEM, TO A CERTAIN
###2628 POINT, THEN IT WAS STOPPED. AND THIS IS THE SECRET OF
###2633 HOW THE PLANT WORKS. BECAUSE THIS SPECIAL LAYER HERE,
###2637 
###2641 A PARTICULAR FEATURE WHICH STOPS ANYTHING FROM MOVING
###2645 FURTHER INTO THE ROOT UNLESS THAT THING IS IN THE
###2649 SYMPLAST. IT ESSENTIALLY IS THE GATE FOR THE APPLE
###2654 PLAST. AND HOW DOES THE ENDODERMIS WORK?
###2658 I HAVE HERE A CARDBOARD BOX WHICH IS MEANT TO
###2661 SORT OF ILLUSTRATE FOR YOU AN ENDODERMAL CELL. AND
###2665 YOU NOTICE ON THIS CARDBOARD BOX, THAT I HAVE THIS RED
###2669 CIRCLE GOING AROUND. THIS RED CIRCLE, ASSUME THE
###2672 CARDBOARD BOX REPRESENTS THE WALL OF THE EPIDERMAL
###2675 CELL, AND THIS RED MATERIAL EXTENDS INTO THE WALL AND
###2680 IT EXTENDS INTO THE INSIDE, IT GOES THROUGH THE WALL.
###2683 WHAT IS THIS RED MATERIAL? WHAT DOES THIS RED
###2686 MATERIAL FUNCTION AS? THIS RED MATERIAL IS CALLED
###2689 SUBERIN. IT IS THE SAME MATERIAL WHICH MAKES CORK
###2696 FLOAT. IT IS WATER IMPERVIOUS.
###2705 WATER IMPERVIOUS.
###2706 THAT IS, BECAUSE IT IS WATER IMPERVIOUS AS SOMETHING
###2711 IN THE APPLE PLASTIC PATHWAY IS MOVING THROUGH THE
###2714 
###2720 SUBERIN LAYER IT CAN'T GO ANY FURTHER. IT CAN'T REACH
###2724 THE SITE OF THE CELL WALL BECAUSE OF THE BLOCKAGE.
###2729 THIS SUBERIN LAYER IS CALLED THE CASPERIAN STRIP. YOU
###2738 MIGHT SAY, OKAY, WELL, IT CAN'T GO THROUGH THIS WALL
###2743 ANY MORE, IT CAN'T GO THROUGH THE APPLE PLAST ANY
###2745 MORE. WHY CAN'T IT JUST GO AROUND IT, WHY CAN'T IT
###2747 JUST GO THROUGH THE CELL AND WIND UP ON THIS SIDE OVER
###2750 HERE? LET'S PRETEND LIKE THIS BALLOON REPRESENTS THE
###2753 MEMBRANE SYSTEM OF THE ENDODERMAL CELL. THIS MEMBRANE
###2757 SYSTEM IS TIGHTLY OPPRESSED ON ALL SIDES TO THE
###2762 CASPERIAN STRIP INSIDE. IT IS RIGHT NEXT TO IT. SO
###2765 THERE IS NO SPACE BETWEEN IT AND THE CELL WALL. SO,
###2769 IF AN ION WANTS TO ENTER WHERE I AM, FROM WHERE YOU
###2774 ARE, IT CAN'T SQUEEZE THROUGH THE CELL WALL. IT CAN'T
###2778 SQUEEZE THROUGH THE SPACES BETWEEN THE MEMBRANE AND
###2781 THE CASPERIAN STRIP. THE ONLY WAY IT CAN ENTER IS BY
###2785 NOW PASSING ACROSS THE MEMBRANE.
###2790 IN THE
###2791 SYMPLAST AND IT IS HOME FREE. AT THIS POINT THE
###2794 PLANT, THOUGH, HAS STOPPED B FROM GOING IN BY
###2797 PREVENTING IT FROM SQUEEZING THROUGH BETWEEN THE
###2801 MEMBRANE AND THE CELL WALL OR BY CONTINUING MOVEMENT
###2804 IN THE APPLE PLAST OF THIS CELL WALL. AND TO GIVE YOU
###2807 SORT OF A BETTER EXAMPLE OF THIS, IT IS HARD BECAUSE I
###2811 AM ASKING YOU TO THINK 3 DIMENSIONALLY HAVE THESE 3
###2813 XEROX BOXES AND I WANT TO PRETEND LIKE THESE ARE TWO
###2817 ENDODERMAL CELLS AND YOU SHOULD REALIZE THAT IF I AM
###2820 THE VASCULAR TISSUE THEY EXTEND ALL OF THE WAY AROUND
###2823 AND ALL OF THE WAY UP, BUT I CAN'T GO TOO FAR UP OKAY,
###2825 SO THEY EXTEND ALL OF THE WAY AROUND. THE CASPERIAN
###2829 STRIP IS REPRESENTED BY THE RED. AND THE CELLS ARE
###2833 TIGHTLY GLUED TOGETHER WHERE INDIVIDUAL CELLS COME IN
###2835 CONTACT. SO THERE IS NO WAY OF GETTING BETWEEN THE
###2838 CELLS INSIDE WHERE I AM. THIS BUBBLE WRAP IS MEANT TO
###2841 REPRESENT ONE OF THE MEMBRANES BETWEEN THE CELLS. SO
###2845 
###2847 WHERE YOU ARE AND THE BLUE REPRESENT THE
###2850 PLASMODESMATA, THE PORES. SO, ONCE YOU ARE INSIDE THE
###2853 SYMPLAST YOU ARE ABLE THEN, TO MOVE WHERE I AM IN THE
###2857 VASCULAR TISSUE. AND IF YOU WERE IN THE SYMPLAST AND
###2861 YOU MADE IT THROUGH THIS PARTICULAR MEMBRANE AND LET'S
###2864 SAY NOW YOU WERE INSIDE THE ENDODERMAL CELL, WHAT
###2867 WOULD YOU SEE? IF YOU WERE INSIDE THE ENDODERMAL
###2869 CELL SAY YOU ARE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CELL
###2871 HERE, YOU WOULD LOOK UP, AND DOWN, TO THE SIDE AND
###2874 AROUND. YOU WOULD SEE THE CASPERIAN STRIP. BUT YOU
###2877 WOULDN'T CARE BECAUSE YOU ARE ALREADY IN THE SYMPLAST
###2879 IN THE CASPERIAN STRIP IS A LONG THE OUTSIDE. THE
###2883 CASPERIAN TRIP IS NOT A CURTAIN, IT IS ONLY IMBEDDED
###2886 IN THE CELL WALL AND THE PROTOPLAST OR THE MEMBRANE IS
###2890 WHAT PREVENTS MOVEMENT BETWEEN THE CELL WALL AND THE
###2895 SYMPLAST, BECAUSE IT IS DIRECTLY AGAINST THE CASPERIAN
###2898 STRIP. SO MAKE SURE YOU READ THIS IN THE BOOK. IT IS
###2901 
###2903 THINK 3 DIMENSION ALLEY ABOUT THIS. LET ME NOW SHOW
###2908 YOU A FEW PICTURES OF THIS TO HELP YOU PUT IT IN TO
###2912 CONTEXT AS FAR AS 3 DIMENSIONS. I REALIZE IT IS HARD.
###2915 HERE IS THE CROSS SECTION OF THE ROOT JUST AS WE
###2917 LOOKED AT BEFORE. HERE WOULD BE THE CORTEX AND WHAT I
###2922 WANT TO POINT OUT TO THE CORTEX, HERE ARE THE INTRA
###2924 CELLULAR SPACES BETWEEN ADJACENT CORTICAL CELLS. SO,
###2928 IN THE APPLE PLASTIC PATHWAY, AND ION COULD MOVE ALL
###2932 OF THE WAY THROUGH THE CELL WALLS AND INTO
###2934 INTRACELLULAR SPACES. UP TO THIS POINT HERE, WHERE IT
###2936 WOULD ENCOUNTER THE CASPERIAN STRIP. ONCE IT GOT
###2939 INSIDE THE CELL THOUGH, JUST LIKE I DREW THOSE LITTLE
###2942 BLUE DOTS, THESE ARE THE PLASMODESMATA. THESE ARE THE
###2945 PORES THAT YOU WOULD SEE IF YOU WERE MOVING THROUGH
###2948 FROM ONE CELL TO ANOTHER. NOW, I WANT TO JUST POINT
###2952 OUT TO YOU THE CASPERIAN STRIP AGAIN AND ITS LOCATION
###2955 AROUND THIS HERE. IF YOU WERE A CELL MOVING, AN ION
###2958 
###2962 ENDODERMIS, AND HERE IS THE CASPERIAN STRIP ALL OF THE
###2964 WAY AROUND. IF YOU WERE IN THE SYMPLAST YOU COULD
###2967 MOVE DIRECTLY THROUGH FROM THE CORTEX TO THE CENTRAL
###2971 CYLINDER TO THE VASCULAR TISSUE. BUT YOU NEED TO BE
###2974 IN THE SYMPLAST. AND THE SLIDE THAT WILL TAKE THIS
###2977 HOME AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU LOOK AT IT, IF NOT
###2980 HERE, IN YOUR TEXT BOOK, THE SLIDE WHICH WILL TAKE IT
###2983 HOME IS THE SUMMARY SLIDE SHOWING YOU THE TWO
###2985 PATHWAYS. THE APPLEPLASTIC PATHWAY IN WHICH THE ION
###2989 IS STOPPED, HAVING TRAVELED THROUGH THE CELL WALL AND
###2992 INTO INTRACELLULAR SPACE. AND THIS SYMPLASTIC PATHWAY
###2995 WHERE THE ION HAS CROSSED THE MEMBRANE IN THIS
###2997 PARTICULAR CASE, CROSSED IT AT THE ROOT HERE. ONCE
###2999 HAVING CROSSED THE MEMBRANE, IT IS IN THE SYMPLAST AND
###3002 CAN MAKE IT ALL OF THE WAY TO THE VASCULAR TISSUE.
###3005 MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND HOW THIS FUNCTIONS. IT IS AN
###3007 IMPORTANT WAY THE ROOT WORKS.
