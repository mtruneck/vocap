1
0:2:28,604 --> 0:2:39,406
Defense, help, help, help!


2
0:2:39,406 --> 0:2:43,661
Time-out. Somebody call time-out.


3
0:2:43,661 --> 0:2:47,998
- Get over here! Come here. Come on!
- We're coming, we're coming.


4
0:2:47,998 --> 0:2:50,292
Antoine. Son, how many times
I gotta tell you


5
0:2:50,292 --> 0:2:52,628
don't knock the ball into the parking lot?


6
0:2:52,628 --> 0:2:55,256
- Yes, Dad.
- Nice shot.


7
0:2:55,256 --> 0:2:58,175
All right, fellas, listen up.
This is what it is.


8
0:2:58,175 --> 0:3:0,594
We're down by one point,
28 seconds to go.


9
0:3:0,594 --> 0:3:3,514
We gotta get the ball back.
Make 'em give it up, understand?


10
0:3:3,514 --> 0:3:5,182
- Yes.
- All right.


11
0:3:5,182 --> 0:3:7,393
- I want Kenny to take the last shot.
- Let me!


12
0:3:7,393 --> 0:3:9,144
- This one's on Kenny.
- He'll miss it!


13
0:3:9,144 --> 0:3:11,188
- Antoine!
- But the guy's all over me.


14
0:3:11,188 --> 0:3:14,65
- What if I can't get open for a shot?
- Henry, can you set a pick for him?


15
0:3:14,65 --> 0:3:16,443
- That's all it takes.
- Henry's wack!


16
0:3:16,443 --> 0:3:18,779
Antoine, get serious.


17
0:3:18,779 --> 0:3:21,365
Henry's gonna set the pick,
you gonna take the shot,


18
0:3:21,365 --> 0:3:26,12
you gonna bring it up, all right?
Now give me some hands.


19
0:3:26,12 --> 0:3:30,291
Hands! Last chance. Get real.


20
0:3:30,291 --> 0:3:32,1
Win!


21
0:3:32,1 --> 0:3:34,295
Now let's get out there
and beat somebody!


22
0:3:34,295 --> 0:3:37,923
You want me to shoot
to win the game? Me?


23
0:3:37,923 --> 0:3:43,846
I want you to shoot to win.
You can do it, son.


24
0:3:43,846 --> 0:3:46,307
A and K, all the way!


25
0:3:46,307 --> 0:3:49,685
- Oh, Ma.
- Oh, man.


26
0:3:49,685 --> 0:3:55,232
OK, boys, let's play some ball!


27
0:3:55,232 --> 0:3:57,234
Kenny!


28
0:3:57,234 --> 0:4:2,114
Go, Kenny!


29
0:4:2,114 --> 0:4:8,37
Go, go, go! Kenny, go! Shoot it!


30
0:4:8,37 --> 0:4:10,456
What?


31
0:4:10,456 --> 0:4:26,68
All right, all right.


32
0:4:26,68 --> 0:4:30,267
- I can't believe that.
- That's so not cool.


33
0:4:30,267 --> 0:4:33,2
You played great, guys.


34
0:4:33,2 --> 0:4:35,231
- Come on, bro, it's all right.
- Oh, man.


35
0:4:35,231 --> 0:4:38,484
- Come on.
- Dang.


36
0:4:38,484 --> 0:4:42,112
- I should have made that.
- It's all right. It's all right.


37
0:4:42,112 --> 0:4:45,533
Hold them heads up. It's all right.
It's all right. You're still my boys.


38
0:4:45,533 --> 0:4:47,868
Come on, man.
Just give me the ball.


39
0:4:47,868 --> 0:4:48,994
All right.


40
0:4:48,994 --> 0:4:51,705
Can't you see I'm in the zone?
Just pass the ball.


41
0:4:51,705 --> 0:4:54,83
All right.


42
0:4:54,83 --> 0:4:59,46
- You missed a lay-up. So what?
- So what? So what?!


43
0:4:59,46 --> 0:5:3,467
Man, we lost! We lost because of me!
Man, I don't get it.


44
0:5:3,467 --> 0:5:7,805
I had 'em with the Antoine lookaway.
I had my tongue hanging out like Mike.


45
0:5:7,805 --> 0:5:10,516
There's no way that shot doesn't drop.


46
0:5:10,516 --> 0:5:13,185
Unless that tongue's
got some aerodynamic properties,


47
0:5:13,185 --> 0:5:15,229
it's not gonna help you make a lay-up.


48
0:5:15,229 --> 0:5:17,439
That's what I said,
aerodynamic properties.


49
0:5:17,439 --> 0:5:18,566
Tell it to Mike.


50
0:5:18,566 --> 0:5:21,318
Come on, James.
Those two need to come on inside,


51
0:5:21,318 --> 0:5:23,487
get their homework done and go to bed.


52
0:5:23,487 --> 0:5:26,615
- Aw, Ma, just a couple more minutes?
- Come onů please!


53
0:5:26,615 --> 0:5:31,495
- Don't "Aw, Ma" me.
- Give us a minute, sweetheart.


54
0:5:31,495 --> 0:5:36,625
Looků if you play the game
with passion and dignity,


55
0:5:36,625 --> 0:5:40,546
it'll take you anywhere you want to go.


56
0:5:40,546 --> 0:5:48,22
Cut it out. Hook up.


57
0:5:48,22 --> 0:5:54,643
All you boys gotta do is stick together.
You do that, anything can happen.


58
0:5:54,643 --> 0:6:0,65
Do you understand
what that means? Anything.


59
0:6:0,65 --> 0:6:2,276
All right. Go on inside.


60
0:6:2,276 --> 0:6:5,321
- Aw, Dad.
- Go inside.


61
0:6:5,321 --> 0:6:9,241
Get in the house before your mom
come out here and snatch you up.


62
0:6:9,241 --> 0:6:18,25
Hey, hold up, little man.


63
0:6:18,25 --> 0:6:21,879
You know, I think you would've
made that shot today.


64
0:6:21,879 --> 0:6:27,51
You gotta have faith, Kenny.
It's in here, man. Right here.


65
0:6:27,51 --> 0:6:33,39
You just gotta trust it, all right?


66
0:6:33,39 --> 0:6:34,934
- Go on inside.
- OK.


67
0:6:34,934 --> 0:6:38,771
- Take Murphy with you.
- All right. Come on, Murphy. Let's go.


68
0:6:38,771 --> 0:7:3,587
If you help me do my homework,
I'll get you a biscuit.


69
0:7:3,587 --> 0:7:6,59
And Kenny Tyler
serves up the alley-oop


70
0:7:6,59 --> 0:7:9,51
and Antoine Tyler slams it home.


71
0:7:9,51 --> 0:7:15,57
And that's the one-two punch. And the
Tyler brothers cannot be stopped.


72
0:7:15,57 --> 0:7:16,433
A no-look pass from Kenny Tyler


73
0:7:16,433 --> 0:7:20,2
and a double-fisted "slam, bam,
thank you ma'am" from Antoine Tyler.


74
0:7:20,2 --> 0:7:22,147
The Huskies are within one
of the Wildcats.


75
0:7:22,147 --> 0:7:23,899
78-77, a ten-one run,


76
0:7:23,899 --> 0:7:26,485
and Lute Olson's gonna call
a time-out here to regroup.


77
0:7:26,485 --> 0:7:28,279
Bernie, what else
can we say about him?


78
0:7:28,279 --> 0:7:30,739
A lot, Ernie. Let me tell you,
there's no question


79
0:7:30,739 --> 0:7:33,117
he's the reason
the Huskies are 19 and six.


80
0:7:33,117 --> 0:7:36,996
Antoine Tyler just will
not allow this team to lose.


81
0:7:36,996 --> 0:7:39,915
Virtually overlooked in pre-season polls,
they have scraped


82
0:7:39,915 --> 0:7:43,335
and clawed their way
into the top of Pac-10 standings.


83
0:7:43,335 --> 0:7:47,548
You did a little scraping and clawing
yourself last night there, Bernie.


84
0:7:47,548 --> 0:7:51,594
Incidentally, if they win the Pac-10,
it'll be the first time since 1985.


85
0:7:51,594 --> 0:7:55,306
And that is a long, long,
long, long, long time to wait.


86
0:7:55,306 --> 0:7:59,602
And here's Harry the Husky
to attempt his patented slam dunk.


87
0:7:59,602 --> 0:8:6,317
Let's give him a big hand, folks.
And let's cross our fingers, too.


88
0:8:6,317 --> 0:8:9,904
Harry the Husky
on the run and the flyů


89
0:8:9,904 --> 0:8:13,115
Whoa! Split the crossbeams
on that one.


90
0:8:13,115 --> 0:8:16,66
Did we make it?


91
0:8:16,66 --> 0:8:20,289
- Huskies!
- Yeah!


92
0:8:20,289 --> 0:8:24,418
OK, we were 15 down at the half. We
fought like hell to get back in this thing,


93
0:8:24,418 --> 0:8:28,714
so let's not run out of steam, all right?
We gotta force a turnover.


94
0:8:28,714 --> 0:8:29,924
Malik?


95
0:8:29,924 --> 0:8:34,345
Malik, what are thoů Are those shorts
or a pair of damn hip-huggers?


96
0:8:34,345 --> 0:8:37,598
Yo, Coach, it's the '90s. It's a style thing.


97
0:8:37,598 --> 0:8:41,18
Here's my style thing.
I want you all over McCailiff, OK?


98
0:8:41,18 --> 0:8:43,771
He goes to the crapper,
I want you standing ready to wipe him.


99
0:8:43,771 --> 0:8:45,189
- I got him. Let's go.
- Good.


100
0:8:45,189 --> 0:8:48,359
Zigiů Listen, you're
the last line of defense.


101
0:8:48,359 --> 0:8:51,237
They get a breakaway,
I'll have you back in Siberia eating ice.


102
0:8:51,237 --> 0:8:53,614
- It is Serbia, Coach.
- Whatever.


103
0:8:53,614 --> 0:8:55,491
Listen, double-down on their guards.


104
0:8:55,491 --> 0:8:58,244
I want them to think we're playing
with eight guys out there.


105
0:8:58,244 --> 0:9:1,372
If they make a pass half-court,
they're gonna win the game.


106
0:9:1,372 --> 0:9:2,873
- Danny.
- Yeah, Coach?


107
0:9:2,873 --> 0:9:5,668
I know the game is getting intense,
but don't hit anybody.


108
0:9:5,668 --> 0:9:9,463
- Not unless they deserve it, Coach.
- Hey, hey, Coach? Put me in.


109
0:9:9,463 --> 0:9:14,26
Jimmy, sit down. Now, Kenny,
we need that ball. Go get it for us.


110
0:9:14,26 --> 0:9:16,345
- You got it.
- Are you boys ready for this?


111
0:9:16,345 --> 0:9:17,805
- Focus, baby.
- All right.


112
0:9:17,805 --> 0:9:20,224
- Yeah!
- Cos it's up to you. Come on.


113
0:9:20,224 --> 0:9:21,767
- Let's go!
- Dawgs up, baby!


114
0:9:21,767 --> 0:9:23,477
- Come on.
- Let's go, baby!


115
0:9:23,477 --> 0:9:25,855
- Hey, Coach, is that a new coat?
- Yeah.


116
0:9:25,855 --> 0:9:28,315
Still got the receipt?


117
0:9:28,315 --> 0:9:30,651
Antoine, no joking around.
You're my guy.


118
0:9:30,651 --> 0:9:36,282
You're my guy, too, Coach. No jokes.
We got this one. Hey, Dawgs up!


119
0:9:36,282 --> 0:9:38,742
Let's kick some ass!


120
0:9:38,742 --> 0:9:43,956
Kenny Tyler with an alley-oop
and Antoine Tyler, 360 for the slam!


121
0:9:43,956 --> 0:9:48,711
And the Huskies win!
The Huskies win it 79-78!


122
0:9:48,711 --> 0:9:52,631
Somebody slammed the refrigerator
door and the butter's melting.


123
0:9:52,631 --> 0:9:56,719
Antoine Tyler, he's a first-round
draft choice. Count on it.


124
0:9:56,719 --> 0:9:58,804
We'll see you next week
at Pauley Pavilion


125
0:9:58,804 --> 0:10:2,975
when the Huskies meet the Bruins
to clinch first place in the Pac-10.


126
0:10:2,975 --> 0:10:5,311
- Kenny! Antoine!
- Mom!


127
0:10:5,311 --> 0:10:9,148
You got it. You know you got it.


128
0:10:9,148 --> 0:10:14,612
Oh, gosh. Your father would have
been so proud of you both today.


129
0:10:14,612 --> 0:10:16,697
- I wish he could've seen you play.
- So do we.


130
0:10:16,697 --> 0:10:18,49
But his spirit lives on in you.


131
0:10:18,49 --> 0:10:19,658
- Hey, Ma?
- What?


132
0:10:19,658 --> 0:10:23,162
Dawgs up!


133
0:10:23,162 --> 0:10:43,182
It's the cabbage patch!


134
0:10:43,182 --> 0:10:49,188
Yo. You know what this game is about?
It's about looking good. It's a style thing.


135
0:10:49,188 --> 0:10:51,815
Do you know what I love about
this game? It's so physical.


136
0:10:51,815 --> 0:10:53,651
You know, cos I love contact.


137
0:10:53,651 --> 0:10:54,985
You know how I see myself?


138
0:10:54,985 --> 0:10:58,3
I see myself as the African
ambassador of basketball.


139
0:10:58,3 --> 0:11:0,366
Hello, ladies, I'm Zigi. Zigi Hrbacek.


140
0:11:0,366 --> 0:11:4,495
I'm from Serbia. I play for UDub.
I am seven feet tall.


141
0:11:4,495 --> 0:11:9,83
Today was an off night. I had 30 points,
I believe 15 assists, 12 rebounds.


142
0:11:9,83 --> 0:11:12,336
- Stubbs, you never play.
- Oh, you probably had bad seats.


143
0:11:12,336 --> 0:11:20,803
No, Stubbs, I go to every game.
This guy never plays.


144
0:11:20,803 --> 0:11:22,54
- Antoine!
- Yeah. OK.


145
0:11:22,54 --> 0:11:24,557
That's my boy right there!


146
0:11:24,557 --> 0:11:26,559
Can I have a pitcher of beer, please?


147
0:11:26,559 --> 0:11:30,396
- You got it, Kenny.
- Thank you.


148
0:11:30,396 --> 0:11:35,276
- You go, RC!
- Yeah, that's good.


149
0:11:35,276 --> 0:11:39,28
20 dollars. 20 dollars.


150
0:11:39,28 --> 0:11:44,76
Easy money. Easy cheese.


151
0:11:44,76 --> 0:11:47,997
Here you go, blind boy.


152
0:11:47,997 --> 0:11:50,833
Hey, man!


153
0:11:50,833 --> 0:11:56,46
Who took us all the way toů


154
0:11:56,46 --> 0:11:57,84
And Iů


155
0:11:57,84 --> 0:12:0,426
Hey, hey! Get your nasty ass outta here!


156
0:12:0,426 --> 0:12:11,103
Whoa! OK! OK!


157
0:12:11,103 --> 0:12:15,816
- Where am I at?
- Come on. Shoot it!


158
0:12:15,816 --> 0:12:19,945
What theů?


159
0:12:19,945 --> 0:12:28,162
I am soů I am so sorů
I am - I am so sorry.


160
0:12:28,162 --> 0:12:29,705
Sorry.


161
0:12:29,705 --> 0:12:42,885
It's over there.


162
0:12:42,885 --> 0:12:47,348
Can you believe that seven-foot Serbian
tried to pay me in traveller's cheques?


163
0:12:47,348 --> 0:12:50,559
Why are you taking that man's drachma
or whatever it's called?


164
0:12:50,559 --> 0:12:54,21
- I need 'em, that's why. Come on.
- Lucky shot, man. Lucky shot.


165
0:12:54,21 --> 0:12:57,691
Danny, don't even try it.
I'll shoot 'em on you all day.


166
0:12:57,691 --> 0:13:1,32
Hey, that was a hell of a shot, dog.
I bought you a drink.


167
0:13:1,32 --> 0:13:5,491
"l bought you a drink."
Sit your drunk ass down.


168
0:13:5,491 --> 0:13:8,536
Hey, Cheryl. Hey, Cheryl.
What's happening, baby?


169
0:13:8,536 --> 0:13:10,454
- I was just gonna call you.
- Yeah?


170
0:13:10,454 --> 0:13:13,582
- Yeah.
- Dialing cramps your shooting hand?


171
0:13:13,582 --> 0:13:17,336
No. We just got this tournament coming
up, see. I'm trying to keep my edge.


172
0:13:17,336 --> 0:13:20,506
- You don't want me to lose my edge?
- Oh, no, Antoine.


173
0:13:20,506 --> 0:13:24,844
I don't want you losing your edge, cos
I ain't gonna be around to help you find it.


174
0:13:24,844 --> 0:13:26,971
- Come on, now. Hold on.
- Let me go.


175
0:13:26,971 --> 0:13:29,974
Come on, girl. What you mean?
You not gonna be around?


176
0:13:29,974 --> 0:13:33,6
- No, I'm not gonna be around.
- You really not gonna be around?


177
0:13:33,6 --> 0:13:37,147
No, I'm not gonna be around.


178
0:13:37,147 --> 0:13:39,233
- Uh-huh.
- You know, a little something.


179
0:13:39,233 --> 0:13:40,568
- A little something?
- Yeah.


180
0:13:40,568 --> 0:13:42,653
- You'll be around for me?
- Yeah.


181
0:13:42,653 --> 0:13:50,369
Can I get some?


182
0:13:50,369 --> 0:13:53,414
- That's my girl. I'm crazy about you.
- You better be.


183
0:13:53,414 --> 0:13:55,374
- Crazy about you, girl.
- Later, baby.


184
0:13:55,374 --> 0:13:59,295
- Crazy about you, girl!
- What are you doing, man?


185
0:13:59,295 --> 0:14:1,297
If you can't treat her right, cut her loose.


186
0:14:1,297 --> 0:14:4,675
Stop it. Don't tell me nothing
about females. Stick to Nintendo.


187
0:14:4,675 --> 0:14:8,804
- Aw, come on. What are you saying?
- Your problem is you scared to play.


188
0:14:8,804 --> 0:14:11,265
Look here. I wrote the book
on macking, baby.


189
0:14:11,265 --> 0:14:12,808
- Really?
- Uh-huh.


190
0:14:12,808 --> 0:14:14,768
- With these hands.
- Prove it to me then.


191
0:14:14,768 --> 0:14:15,895
- What?
- Prove it.


192
0:14:15,895 --> 0:14:19,315
Hell, I will bet you ten dollars.
You pick any broad in this club,


193
0:14:19,315 --> 0:14:21,275
I'll get that number tonight.


194
0:14:21,275 --> 0:14:23,277
- OK, let meů
- You pick 'em out.


195
0:14:23,277 --> 0:14:28,115
Hey, hey, no midgets, no cockeyed
broads and no toothless chicks.


196
0:14:28,115 --> 0:14:31,202
- Cute ones.
- Ooh, I found her.


197
0:14:31,202 --> 0:14:33,454
- Where?
- At the bar. Cutie-pie.


198
0:14:33,454 --> 0:14:39,126
- Which one?
- 4 o'clock. Red bone.


199
0:14:39,126 --> 0:14:42,4
- You gotta pick somebody else, kid.
- Yeah, that's your type.


200
0:14:42,4 --> 0:14:47,426
Noů I'm just sayingů Hey, look,
I'm just trying to make this a fair bet.


201
0:14:47,426 --> 0:14:51,388
Better yet, I'll go down and pull her,
she'll make us eggs in the morning.


202
0:14:51,388 --> 0:14:54,558
You trying to play me.
I'm gonna show you a real mack, baby.


203
0:14:54,558 --> 0:14:56,56
- You gonna show me?
- Call me Golden.


204
0:14:56,56 --> 0:14:59,563
OK, all right. Go ahead, Golden.
I'm gonna sit up here and watch you


205
0:14:59,563 --> 0:15:3,4
with your mack-daddy crisscross ass.


206
0:15:3,4 --> 0:15:9,31
- I bet a Long Island iced tea.
- I'm betting, too.


207
0:15:9,31 --> 0:15:15,287
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
My bad. Excuse me. Excuse me.


208
0:15:15,287 --> 0:15:19,124
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.


209
0:15:19,124 --> 0:15:33,973
Excuse me.


210
0:15:33,973 --> 0:15:35,85
- Damn!
- Hey.


211
0:15:35,85 --> 0:15:38,18
Hey!


212
0:15:38,18 --> 0:15:40,187
For a guy with 11 assists
and eight rebounds,


213
0:15:40,187 --> 0:15:43,399
you sure got a set of clumsy hands.


214
0:15:43,399 --> 0:15:45,609
Well, sorry.


215
0:15:45,609 --> 0:15:48,153
- I take it you saw the game tonight.
- You look good.


216
0:15:48,153 --> 0:15:51,115
Thank you. I've been working out,
you know what I'm saying?


217
0:15:51,115 --> 0:15:55,35
Your game. You look good.


218
0:15:55,35 --> 0:15:59,248
Oh. Ow! Damn, that hurt.


219
0:15:59,248 --> 0:16:1,667
How you doing?
I'm the wounded Kenny Tyler.


220
0:16:1,667 --> 0:16:8,382
I know. Bit of advice, Kenny Tyler.
You shouldn't make bets you can't win.


221
0:16:8,382 --> 0:16:11,385
Wait. Hold up.
Wait. Hold on. What's your name?


222
0:16:11,385 --> 0:16:16,557
- RC St John.
- RC, I'm sorry about your purse!


223
0:16:16,557 --> 0:16:18,559
See that girl with the bloody nose?


224
0:16:18,559 --> 0:16:21,27
Got kicked out of the game
for elbowing that girl?


225
0:16:21,27 --> 0:16:23,147
- Heyů
- I like her. I like her. Ooh!


226
0:16:23,147 --> 0:16:26,442
- We got an article by a RC St John.
- Never heard of him.


227
0:16:26,442 --> 0:16:27,818
Who?


228
0:16:27,818 --> 0:16:31,363
RC St John, RC St Johnů That's that
new reporter from the UDub Daily.


229
0:16:31,363 --> 0:16:33,741
Thomas told my boys,
said she's the bomb.


230
0:16:33,741 --> 0:16:36,952
Yo, that's Red Bone.
The cutie I tried to talk to at the bar?


231
0:16:36,952 --> 0:16:39,413
Yo, yo, yo, listen to this. Listen to this.


232
0:16:39,413 --> 0:16:43,167
"And on a beautiful touch pass
from his brother Kenny,


233
0:16:43,167 --> 0:16:47,505
Antoine Tyler sealed one of the
biggest upsets in college basketball."


234
0:16:47,505 --> 0:16:50,716
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Yes, I did. Yes, I did.


235
0:16:50,716 --> 0:16:52,76
"While Antoine is theů" Whoa, whoa.


236
0:16:52,76 --> 0:16:56,43
- "..is the engine that runs this teamů"
- Oh, she can write now.


237
0:16:56,43 --> 0:17:0,976
"..it is his younger brother Kenny who
leaves his mark on virtually every play."


238
0:17:0,976 --> 0:17:3,729
That's a good one.


239
0:17:3,729 --> 0:17:11,111
Mouth is all open, you all cockeyed.
"I'm Antoine Tyler, star of the team."


240
0:17:11,111 --> 0:17:12,738
"I'm cross-eyed, so I wear glasses."


241
0:17:12,738 --> 0:17:15,449
Hey, you want me to beat
you up in front of everybody?


242
0:17:15,449 --> 0:17:19,62
- Damn, why you gotta go there?
- Cos I can, crybaby.


243
0:17:19,62 --> 0:17:21,121
OK, ladies, come on!


244
0:17:21,121 --> 0:17:24,41
Let's move it out! We got the
vans waiting. We got a big game.


245
0:17:24,41 --> 0:17:25,251
We're moving. Let's go.


246
0:17:25,251 --> 0:17:28,295
Oh, yeah. I feel good tonight, boy.
It's gonna be a good one.


247
0:17:28,295 --> 0:17:29,713
I'm gonna put on a show tonight.


248
0:17:29,713 --> 0:17:31,507
- I got front-row seats.
- Be there!


249
0:17:31,507 --> 0:17:33,676
Aw, come on now.
You know better, son.


250
0:17:33,676 --> 0:17:37,888
And that's 15 for UCLA's Seward,
but the Huskies still hold on


251
0:17:37,888 --> 0:17:40,724
by a narrow margin
as we near the five-minute mark.


252
0:17:40,724 --> 0:17:44,19
And this seems to be the year
for the Huskies as they topple


253
0:17:44,19 --> 0:17:47,64
one powerhouse after another
en route to their first berth


254
0:17:47,64 --> 0:17:49,525
in the NCAA tournament since 1984.


255
0:17:49,525 --> 0:17:53,445
O'Grady will bring it up. Lee guarding
him as they cross midcourt.


256
0:17:53,445 --> 0:17:55,781
O'Grady on the dribble.
Goes low post Hrbacek.


257
0:17:55,781 --> 0:17:59,743
Hrbacek back out to O'Grady.
Behind-the-back dribble.


258
0:17:59,743 --> 0:18:3,372
He's gonna feed Kenny Tyler
on the cutter, back to Antoine from 15.


259
0:18:3,372 --> 0:18:5,165
Buried it! 46 for Antoine.


260
0:18:5,165 --> 0:18:9,712
15 assists for brother Kenny, as they
continue their quest for NCAA magic.


261
0:18:9,712 --> 0:18:14,49
And the Huskies lead by two.


262
0:18:14,49 --> 0:18:18,971
As we close in on four minutes,
Lee will bring it up, guarded by O'Grady.


263
0:18:18,971 --> 0:18:21,98
Lee over to Rhem,
guarded by Antoine Tyler.


264
0:18:21,98 --> 0:18:24,56
Gonna try to drive the lane,
goes up and rejected by Kenny Tyler.


265
0:18:24,56 --> 0:18:27,354
They're gonna call a foul.
And that's number three on Kenny.


266
0:18:27,354 --> 0:18:28,647
That seemed clean to me.


267
0:18:28,647 --> 0:18:32,568
Next time down, run the fist out
and bring him hard across the middle.


268
0:18:32,568 --> 0:18:33,861
- A and K.
- All the way.


269
0:18:33,861 --> 0:18:36,155
- If you ain't open, who'll you pass it to?
- Who else?


270
0:18:36,155 --> 0:18:38,657
Just making sure you remember.
Don't you forget it.


271
0:18:38,657 --> 0:18:40,576
I can't. You keep pounding it in my head.


272
0:18:40,576 --> 0:18:44,38
Rhem at the line, a 67% foul shooter.
He's been cold tonight.


273
0:18:44,38 --> 0:18:46,832
Just four points on the evening.


274
0:18:46,832 --> 0:18:48,959
That one, nothing
but the bottom of the net.


275
0:18:48,959 --> 0:18:52,46
And he'll have another
to try to bring the Bruins even.


276
0:18:52,46 --> 0:18:53,464
Box out! Zigi, rebound!


277
0:18:53,464 --> 0:18:57,92
Rhem to try to tie things up. Young,
the rebound, trying to pass it out toů


278
0:18:57,92 --> 0:19:1,347
Picked off by O'Grady. O'Grady
to open Tyler, he starts a fast break.


279
0:19:1,347 --> 0:19:4,308
And he has brother Antoine
breaking for the basket.


280
0:19:4,308 --> 0:19:7,853
Kenny Tyler on the dish
to brother Antoine


281
0:19:7,853 --> 0:19:13,25
as they've done so many times before.
And Antoine for a monster jam!


282
0:19:13,25 --> 0:19:14,235
Yeah!


283
0:19:14,235 --> 0:19:30,292
He's a future NBA all-star in the making!


284
0:19:30,292 --> 0:19:34,922
Yeah, baby!


285
0:19:34,922 --> 0:19:40,803
Ant?


286
0:19:40,803 --> 0:19:43,597
- All right, back off.
- Watch it, Lik!


287
0:19:43,597 --> 0:19:45,224
Ant? Ant, what happened, man?


288
0:19:45,224 --> 0:19:48,102
Step back. I wanna check him out.
Please stand back.


289
0:19:48,102 --> 0:19:51,63
- Antoine? Antoine? Yo, you all right?
- It's OK, Kenny.


290
0:19:51,63 --> 0:19:53,399
Let's get the paramedics
and get him on a stretcher.


291
0:19:53,399 --> 0:19:54,775
I'm gonna come with you.


292
0:19:54,775 --> 0:19:58,779
No, you stay. We still got the lead.
Finish these bums off, all right?


293
0:19:58,779 --> 0:20:1,365
Step back, please.
Let's give him some room.


294
0:20:1,365 --> 0:20:3,284
- Let's go!
- All right.


295
0:20:3,284 --> 0:20:5,828
- You all right, man? You gonna be OK?
- I'm OK. I'm OK.


296
0:20:5,828 --> 0:20:10,4
Give us some room, please.


297
0:20:10,4 --> 0:20:15,337
- Nichols, go along with him, OK?
- OK, Coach. I'll go with him.


298
0:20:15,337 --> 0:20:19,3
- It's OK. It's gonna be OK.
- I'm right here, kid. You all right?


299
0:20:19,3 --> 0:20:23,345
- I'm all right. I'll be back.
- Ant?


300
0:20:23,345 --> 0:20:25,139
I'll be back, baby.


301
0:20:25,139 --> 0:20:28,517
- Respiration's 35 and shallow.
- You'll be all right.


302
0:20:28,517 --> 0:20:31,2
Is he asthmatic?
Medications? Histories?


303
0:20:31,2 --> 0:20:34,565
- No history.
- Let's get a BP on him.


304
0:20:34,565 --> 0:20:37,318
- I'll be back.
- You'll be OK, Antoine.


305
0:20:37,318 --> 0:20:38,611
Stay strong.


306
0:20:38,611 --> 0:20:44,95
- He's gonna be all right, OK?
- All right.


307
0:20:44,95 --> 0:20:49,955
- Move it! Move it!
- Let's move it!


308
0:20:49,955 --> 0:20:51,498
- I can't find a pulse!
- What?


309
0:20:51,498 --> 0:21:8,599
One, two, three, fourů


310
0:21:8,599 --> 0:21:13,854
You'll be all right, Antoine.


311
0:21:13,854 --> 0:21:18,817
- What are you doing?
- Just trying to get his heart started.


312
0:21:18,817 --> 0:21:34,458
- Do something! Come on. Come on.
- Clear!


313
0:21:34,458 --> 0:21:40,256
- Can't believe we lost this game!
- We suck. Pathetic.


314
0:21:40,256 --> 0:21:43,133
Let's get the hell outta here.


315
0:21:43,133 --> 0:21:59,733
Damn!


316
0:21:59,733 --> 0:22:0,985
Kenny?


317
0:22:0,985 --> 0:22:6,699
Hey, Coach, I'm about to visit Antoine
in the hospital. I gotta get his stuff.


318
0:22:6,699 --> 0:22:12,496
- Kenny.
- What, Coach?


319
0:22:12,496 --> 0:22:15,82
- We lost him, Kenny.
- What, Coach, for the season?


320
0:22:15,82 --> 0:22:17,459
I told that boy to stop dunking
like he was Jordan.


321
0:22:17,459 --> 0:22:21,839
- What? He dislocated his shoulder?
- Kennyů


322
0:22:21,839 --> 0:22:25,467
What, Coach?


323
0:22:25,467 --> 0:22:32,266
Antoine died on the way
to the university hospital.


324
0:22:32,266 --> 0:22:34,977
He what?


325
0:22:34,977 --> 0:22:40,24
It was his heart. They don't know why.
I mean, it justů


326
0:22:40,24 --> 0:22:43,527
Coachů He just said
he was coming right back.


327
0:22:43,527 --> 0:22:46,864
They tried everything, Kenny, but theyů
It happened so fast thatů


328
0:22:46,864 --> 0:22:51,452
Nah. Bullshit. Bullshit, he died.
I'm going to the hospital.


329
0:22:51,452 --> 0:22:52,745
- Kenny!
- Kenny, hold on.


330
0:22:52,745 --> 0:22:55,331
- Move. I gotta go. Get off me!
- Come on, man.


331
0:22:55,331 --> 0:22:56,874
- Get off me!
- Hold on a second.


332
0:22:56,874 --> 0:22:59,919
- Get off me, man! Luther, get off me!
- Hold up, man! Hold up!


333
0:22:59,919 --> 0:23:2,129
Get off me, man.


334
0:23:2,129 --> 0:23:4,59
Calm down, baby.
We'll get through this together.


335
0:23:4,59 --> 0:23:9,178
I'm so sorry, Kenny. I'm so sorry.


336
0:23:9,178 --> 0:23:51,345
Oh, man.


337
0:23:51,345 --> 0:23:53,764
Tyler slowly up court, brings it upů


338
0:23:53,764 --> 0:23:56,892
Oh, and it's stolen away.
Cubby took it like candy from a baby.


339
0:23:56,892 --> 0:23:58,853
This doesn't look good for the Huskies.


340
0:23:58,853 --> 0:24:1,689
This is their three-game losing streak.
They need to snap that


341
0:24:1,689 --> 0:24:3,44
and get on with the game.


342
0:24:3,44 --> 0:24:6,61
Major scoops it out.
And Tyler will take a threeů


343
0:24:6,61 --> 0:24:8,112
- Oh, another brick.
- Damn!


344
0:24:8,112 --> 0:24:10,656
That's another disappointing
shocker, as the Huskies


345
0:24:10,656 --> 0:24:14,702
just cannot win without their big star.


346
0:24:14,702 --> 0:24:18,414
Kenny. Kenny. Just a few questions.


347
0:24:18,414 --> 0:24:51,405
First your father has a heart attack
and then your brotherů


348
0:24:51,405 --> 0:24:56,327
It wasn't supposed to be like this, kid.


349
0:24:56,327 --> 0:25:0,122
First Pop.


350
0:25:0,122 --> 0:25:1,832
Now you.


351
0:25:1,832 --> 0:25:6,212
Our whole life.
Before school, after school,


352
0:25:6,212 --> 0:25:10,49
at night when it was too dark to seeů


353
0:25:10,49 --> 0:25:12,968
all we wanted to do
was play basketball.


354
0:25:12,968 --> 0:25:17,556
Win that championship, baby.


355
0:25:17,556 --> 0:25:29,68
A and K, allů


356
0:25:29,68 --> 0:25:34,73
What am I supposed to do now, man?


357
0:25:34,73 --> 0:25:38,619
I can't do this alone, Antoine.


358
0:25:38,619 --> 0:26:23,289
I need you, kid.


359
0:26:23,289 --> 0:26:25,4
- Hi.
- Come on, man. No interviews.


360
0:26:25,4 --> 0:26:27,543
- I'm not here toů
- I'm tired of talking to reporters.


361
0:26:27,543 --> 0:26:29,879
- I'm not a reporter.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.


362
0:26:29,879 --> 0:26:33,465
I mean, not right this minute.


363
0:26:33,465 --> 0:26:34,758
What?


364
0:26:34,758 --> 0:26:38,304
I just wanted to say I'm really sorry
about what happened to your brother.


365
0:26:38,304 --> 0:26:42,6
- I can't imagine.
- Thank you. But I'm fine, really.


366
0:26:42,6 --> 0:26:47,21
To be honest with you, I'm really tired
of all the sympathy, you know?


367
0:26:47,21 --> 0:26:52,26
So this was a bad idea? OK, I got it.
I'll just leave. Forget it.


368
0:26:52,26 --> 0:26:55,404
No, wait. Wait. RC, wait!


369
0:26:55,404 --> 0:26:58,282
It's not you. I'm just not used
to all this attention.


370
0:26:58,282 --> 0:27:0,951
I got all these people calling me,
asking me questions.


371
0:27:0,951 --> 0:27:4,997
ESPN, Time magazineů
Sticking all these cameras in my face.


372
0:27:4,997 --> 0:27:10,252
- All this just cos my brother dies?
- I know, it's been awful.


373
0:27:10,252 --> 0:27:14,632
Umbrella?


374
0:27:14,632 --> 0:27:17,927
- Thank you.
- If you just wanna talk, you knowů


375
0:27:17,927 --> 0:27:20,513
- Thank you very much.
- If you need someone to talk toů


376
0:27:20,513 --> 0:27:23,849
Look, I ain't gonna thank you again.
All right. I'm joking.


377
0:27:23,849 --> 0:27:25,768
- Come on!
- Watch your man, Zigi!


378
0:27:25,768 --> 0:27:29,146
Come on. All right. Watch the back pick!


379
0:27:29,146 --> 0:27:32,9
Kenny, set the offence!
Come on, you guys. Kenny, come on!


380
0:27:32,9 --> 0:27:34,61
- Luther, move it.
- Dammit!


381
0:27:34,61 --> 0:27:37,988
What is that? What is that?
Come on, Kenny.


382
0:27:37,988 --> 0:27:39,865
I am!


383
0:27:39,865 --> 0:27:42,952
Let's go. Come on, run the double fist.


384
0:27:42,952 --> 0:27:47,39
Luther, I can't run that play if you can't
get open. Move it, Luther! Move it!


385
0:27:47,39 --> 0:27:50,417
- Kenny!
- Hold it, hold it. Stop.


386
0:27:50,417 --> 0:27:55,84
Give me the ball.


387
0:27:55,84 --> 0:27:58,759
Luther, my wife's got a plastic
Jesus on her dashboard


388
0:27:58,759 --> 0:28:1,178
- moves better than you do.
- Luther!


389
0:28:1,178 --> 0:28:4,348
Listen, boys. We don't win this
next game, it's sayonara season.


390
0:28:4,348 --> 0:28:9,603
It's no NCAA. It's no nothing.
What do you say, Coach?


391
0:28:9,603 --> 0:28:13,524
I say we go out there and win.


392
0:28:13,524 --> 0:28:17,945
All right, feed on that enthusiasm.
Set the offence.


393
0:28:17,945 --> 0:28:22,408
Offence, come on, let's go.


394
0:28:22,408 --> 0:28:25,953
Give 'em the ball.


395
0:28:25,953 --> 0:28:27,288
- Come on!
- Here we go.


396
0:28:27,288 --> 0:28:29,498
- Come on.
- Let's go, Dawgs.


397
0:28:29,498 --> 0:28:31,417
- One to one.
- Come on, let's go.


398
0:28:31,417 --> 0:28:35,838
- Kenny! Kenny!
- Big man for the three!


399
0:28:35,838 --> 0:28:40,9
Hold it, hold it. Hold it a second!
Zigi, what the hell are you thinking?


400
0:28:40,9 --> 0:28:42,11
- Wellů
- You never shoot the three.


401
0:28:42,11 --> 0:28:47,16
You hear me?
You never shoot the three!


402
0:28:47,16 --> 0:28:52,605
Everybody, Iů


403
0:28:52,605 --> 0:28:55,941
- Hit the showers.
- All right. Go hit the showers. Take it in.


404
0:28:55,941 --> 0:28:58,611
Malik, three-point line in America
longer than in Serbia.


405
0:28:58,611 --> 0:29:2,72
Shut up, you seven-foot Tweety.


406
0:29:2,72 --> 0:29:16,45
Shit, man. Damn!


407
0:29:16,45 --> 0:29:18,881
Coach?


408
0:29:18,881 --> 0:29:22,51
Hey, Coach?


409
0:29:22,51 --> 0:29:23,677
Coach!


410
0:29:23,677 --> 0:29:26,96
The ball, it's gone!


411
0:29:26,96 --> 0:29:53,499
It disappeared! Coach!


412
0:29:53,499 --> 0:29:58,128
- Hm. How you doing?
- How you doing?


413
0:29:58,128 --> 0:30:0,172
- I'm fine. I'm chillin'.
- Really?


414
0:30:0,172 --> 0:30:3,676
- Yeah.
- Cos I'm worried about you.


415
0:30:3,676 --> 0:30:6,637
Coach, I'm a big boy.
You ain't gotta worry about me.


416
0:30:6,637 --> 0:30:8,389
Well, I do.


417
0:30:8,389 --> 0:30:12,726
You've been hit pretty hard lately.
I don't want to add to your problems.


418
0:30:12,726 --> 0:30:17,106
But Coach Nichols thinks I should
start Jimmy at the point tomorrow.


419
0:30:17,106 --> 0:30:20,484
I'd ignore him, but it's the first
original idea he's had in five seasons,


420
0:30:20,484 --> 0:30:23,529
so I'm trying it on for size.


421
0:30:23,529 --> 0:30:26,866
What do you think?


422
0:30:26,866 --> 0:30:31,787
- You're the Coach, right?
- Yes, I am.


423
0:30:31,787 --> 0:30:33,873
Jimmy can't set the pick or go to his left.


424
0:30:33,873 --> 0:30:39,67
I mean, he couldn't carry this team
with a forklift. Kenny, you're my guy now.


425
0:30:39,67 --> 0:30:41,839
I gotta know you're ready
to step up to the plate.


426
0:30:41,839 --> 0:30:45,926
Yesterday was the worst practice
I've seen from any team I've coached.


427
0:30:45,926 --> 0:30:48,554
And you didn't say a word.
Now why is that?


428
0:30:48,554 --> 0:30:51,974
- Coach, I'm not Antoine, man.
- I know who I'm talking to.


429
0:30:51,974 --> 0:30:55,144
I need you to take charge of this team.
Now I need a general.


430
0:30:55,144 --> 0:30:58,22
- That's not my game.
- I'm asking you to make it your game.


431
0:30:58,22 --> 0:31:4,486
- But if it's not my game, you can'tů
- I'mů


432
0:31:4,486 --> 0:31:8,908
Kenny, you know,
it was four years ago today


433
0:31:8,908 --> 0:31:13,537
that your brother signed a letter of intent
to play basketball at UDub.


434
0:31:13,537 --> 0:31:16,832
I remember that day. I opened
a ten-year-old bottle of Scotch,


435
0:31:16,832 --> 0:31:19,376
I went home for lunch,
I took a run at the wifeů


436
0:31:19,376 --> 0:31:22,87
- I don't wanna hear that.
- That was a great day.


437
0:31:22,87 --> 0:31:24,59
And the next year, we signed you
and I knew I had a team


438
0:31:24,59 --> 0:31:30,346
that could take Washington to the
Final Four for the first time since '63.


439
0:31:30,346 --> 0:31:39,647
And I'm not willing to say goodbye
to that dream, Kenny. Are you?


440
0:31:39,647 --> 0:31:44,944
I gotta go, Coach. I got a two o'clock.


441
0:31:44,944 --> 0:31:47,112
Hey, Kenny.


442
0:31:47,112 --> 0:31:50,282
You don't have to play
without your brother, you know.


443
0:31:50,282 --> 0:32:1,168
You got him. Right here.


444
0:32:1,168 --> 0:32:6,549
At the second half, the Cal Bears
lead the hapless Huskies, 43-31.


445
0:32:6,549 --> 0:32:10,386
But the big story tonight:
The continuing poor play of Kenny Tyler


446
0:32:10,386 --> 0:32:12,471
with no points on no attempts.


447
0:32:12,471 --> 0:32:18,477
- Hey, health food. All right.
- Mikulski, you're not eating?


448
0:32:18,477 --> 0:32:21,564
No, I can't eat any more
when I watch these guys.


449
0:32:21,564 --> 0:32:23,691
They make me sick.


450
0:32:23,691 --> 0:32:27,403
I feel like I'm wasting away.


451
0:32:27,403 --> 0:32:30,614
OK, guys. Now we're down 12,
but we don't stink.


452
0:32:30,614 --> 0:32:32,616
Now, that's an improvement, all right?


453
0:32:32,616 --> 0:32:36,78
OK, move 'em around on offence.
Move the basketball, OK?


454
0:32:36,78 --> 0:32:38,414
- Come on. Dawgs up here.
- OK, hands in.


455
0:32:38,414 --> 0:32:43,169
- One, two, three.
- Go.


456
0:32:43,169 --> 0:32:44,92
- Hey, Kenny. Kenny!
- Yeah?


457
0:32:44,92 --> 0:32:47,506
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.


458
0:32:47,506 --> 0:32:50,301
OK, listen. If you get open,
take the damn shot.


459
0:32:50,301 --> 0:32:53,512
- All right.
- OK.


460
0:32:53,512 --> 0:32:59,31
And if you're not open,
who are you gonna pass it to?


461
0:32:59,31 --> 0:33:2,73
Ten-foot fadeaway
and that'll drop off the rim.


462
0:33:2,73 --> 0:33:5,24
Tyler comes up with a rebound.
He'll bring it up.


463
0:33:5,24 --> 0:33:8,569
Let's see if Tyler will finally
take a shot this time downcourt.


464
0:33:8,569 --> 0:33:13,657
- Tyler stops, calls the play.
- Anything can happen.


465
0:33:13,657 --> 0:33:16,118
Tyler turns andů
We got a pass!


466
0:33:16,118 --> 0:33:17,578
Nice pass.


467
0:33:17,578 --> 0:33:22,458
Outside the three-point arc to O'Grady.
O'Grady for three!


468
0:33:22,458 --> 0:33:26,337
- And the Huskiesů
- Great pass! Great pass!


469
0:33:26,337 --> 0:33:27,713
What the heck?


470
0:33:27,713 --> 0:33:29,798
Cal bring it back up.
Tyler tries to run him down.


471
0:33:29,798 --> 0:33:35,137
He'll dish it off to Byron. Byron, easy
ten-footer. Got it. Nope, he didn't.


472
0:33:35,137 --> 0:33:38,15
It's in and out. What a heartbreak.


473
0:33:38,15 --> 0:33:40,476
Tyler with a rebound over to O'Grady.


474
0:33:40,476 --> 0:33:42,228
What kind of shot was that?


475
0:33:42,228 --> 0:33:44,313
O'Grady across the timeline,
he puts the move on Faby.


476
0:33:44,313 --> 0:33:47,525
Serves up the no-look pass,
and Major with a slam!


477
0:33:47,525 --> 0:33:53,28
And it's Dawgs up! Well, well, well.
The Huskies are back. They're on fire.


478
0:33:53,28 --> 0:33:56,534
That's five unanswered points by the
Huskies. They're back in the game.


479
0:33:56,534 --> 0:33:57,826
Fill me in, Bernie.


480
0:33:57,826 --> 0:34:1,539
Eight seconds left in the game.
Huskies 72, Bears 73. Bears up by one.


481
0:34:1,539 --> 0:34:4,834
- That makes the Huskies down by one.
- They in-bound the ball.


482
0:34:4,834 --> 0:34:7,628
Cal in-bounds the ball.
Eight seconds and counting.


483
0:34:7,628 --> 0:34:11,382
The Huskies need a turnover or they
can kiss the post-season goodbye.


484
0:34:11,382 --> 0:34:14,927
Jacksonů on the pass, over to Stevens.


485
0:34:14,927 --> 0:34:17,221
Stevens, top of the key with five, fourů


486
0:34:17,221 --> 0:34:19,181
Open, open!


487
0:34:19,181 --> 0:34:22,268
- And whoa! Hello!
- All the way, baby.


488
0:34:22,268 --> 0:34:26,522
That ball came outta there
like a greased pig.


489
0:34:26,522 --> 0:34:28,232
On the move now. Ahead to Tyler.


490
0:34:28,232 --> 0:34:30,109
- Malik!
- A chest pass for Major.


491
0:34:30,109 --> 0:34:36,31
And that ball loops up
to the basket and goes in!


492
0:34:36,31 --> 0:34:41,36
Nice shot there. You see that? I'm telling
ya, Dawgs up, baby. Dawgs up!


493
0:34:41,36 --> 0:34:44,123
75-73! The Huskies win!


494
0:34:44,123 --> 0:34:48,836
Kenny Tyler with a knuckleball
three-pointer from half-court!


495
0:34:48,836 --> 0:34:52,6
This is one for the highlight reels!


496
0:34:52,6 --> 0:34:54,925
This is one to remember!


497
0:34:54,925 --> 0:34:57,595
Here comes a bonus right now.
Kenny Tyler, folks.


498
0:34:57,595 --> 0:34:58,721
Kenny Tyler, wow!


499
0:34:58,721 --> 0:35:1,765
18 points, nine assists,
and a wild and wacky second half there.


500
0:35:1,765 --> 0:35:4,602
The easy two would've sealed
the game. You went for the three.


501
0:35:4,602 --> 0:35:7,396
Were you trying to send
the basketball world a message?


502
0:35:7,396 --> 0:35:13,319
Not really. I was dribbling down-court
and I saw Malik cut toů cut to the hair.


503
0:35:13,319 --> 0:35:15,196
I mean, to the hole andů


504
0:35:15,196 --> 0:35:17,615
- Kenny?
- Wellů


505
0:35:17,615 --> 0:35:18,866
Kenny?


506
0:35:18,866 --> 0:35:21,41
I'll see you at the Barking Dog.


507
0:35:21,41 --> 0:35:45,809
Did you see me elbow that guy?


508
0:35:45,809 --> 0:35:51,857
Nice game.


509
0:35:51,857 --> 0:35:54,902
Hello?


510
0:35:54,902 --> 0:35:59,31
Hey, Kenny. I'm right here.


511
0:35:59,31 --> 0:36:3,494
Do you hear me?


512
0:36:3,494 --> 0:36:7,81
Hello?


513
0:36:7,81 --> 0:36:11,418
Come on, y'all. Stop playin'.


514
0:36:11,418 --> 0:36:14,38
- Anybody there?
- I've been here for 20 years.


515
0:36:14,38 --> 0:36:15,589
Stop playin', y'all.


516
0:36:15,589 --> 0:36:19,51
All of a sudden,
you don't know my voice?


517
0:36:19,51 --> 0:36:24,39
That's cold.


518
0:36:24,39 --> 0:36:26,16
I don't hear anything.


519
0:36:26,16 --> 0:36:29,645
I might be having a nervous breakdown,
but I'm gonna be all right.


520
0:36:29,645 --> 0:36:34,692
Go home and I'm gonna get me some
sleep. I'll be back on top in the morning.


521
0:36:34,692 --> 0:37:37,171
I see you're gonna need
a little more convincing.


522
0:37:37,171 --> 0:37:41,342
Come on, Kenny. Buggin', man.
Buggin'. Come on now.


523
0:37:41,342 --> 0:37:46,305
Relax and get your shit together, Kenny.
Get your shit together.


524
0:37:46,305 --> 0:37:50,976
This is all a dream. That's all.


525
0:37:50,976 --> 0:37:53,771
I got you. I got you.


526
0:37:53,771 --> 0:37:55,814
Kenny! Kenny, it's me!


527
0:37:55,814 --> 0:37:57,858
- Back up.
- Kenny?


528
0:37:57,858 --> 0:38:0,444
Back up. I will smoke you. Back upů


529
0:38:0,444 --> 0:38:6,33
- Kenny. Kenny, it's me.
- I told you to back up off of me.


530
0:38:6,33 --> 0:38:9,912
God, would you wake up?


531
0:38:9,912 --> 0:38:11,497
- Come here.
- Get off me!


532
0:38:11,497 --> 0:38:13,832
- Listen to me.
- Get off me!


533
0:38:13,832 --> 0:38:18,254
It's just like Pop said:
If you and I stick togetherů


534
0:38:18,254 --> 0:38:25,261
anythingů anythingů


535
0:38:25,261 --> 0:38:31,225
Anythingů


536
0:38:31,225 --> 0:38:33,6
..can happen.


537
0:38:33,6 --> 0:38:40,901
Lock 'em up.


538
0:38:40,901 --> 0:38:44,29
Antoine? It's you?


539
0:38:44,29 --> 0:38:47,741
Yes, it's really me, boy. Come on.


540
0:38:47,741 --> 0:38:54,331
Come on, I told you I was coming back.
I told you I was coming back.


541
0:38:54,331 --> 0:38:55,666
Man.


542
0:38:55,666 --> 0:38:58,46
- I can't believe it, man.
- You better believe it.


543
0:38:58,46 --> 0:39:1,672
Oh, shů Whoa.


544
0:39:1,672 --> 0:39:7,428
It's a little too freaky.
I'mů I'm gonna take a seat.


545
0:39:7,428 --> 0:39:11,223
I'm just gonna get me a seat.


546
0:39:11,223 --> 0:39:13,976
Oh, wow. This is amazing, kid.


547
0:39:13,976 --> 0:39:17,938
I don't believe it, man. Yo, wait till
I tell Mom. She's gonna be so happy.


548
0:39:17,938 --> 0:39:20,107
- Kennyů
- Halloween'll be the bomb this year.


549
0:39:20,107 --> 0:39:23,444
That's not the way it works.
You are the only one that can see me.


550
0:39:23,444 --> 0:39:27,948
- Why?
- Because you called me.


551
0:39:27,948 --> 0:39:32,828
- You said you needed me.
- This will take a lot of getting used to.


552
0:39:32,828 --> 0:39:36,79
Well, get used to it fast, baby.
We got a trophy to get. All right?


553
0:39:36,79 --> 0:39:38,542
- A and K?
- All the way.


554
0:39:38,542 --> 0:39:41,795
- NCů
- Two A, baby!


555
0:39:41,795 --> 0:39:43,464
Yeah!


556
0:39:43,464 --> 0:39:46,217
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.


557
0:39:46,217 --> 0:39:49,887
- It's good to have my little brother back.
- It's good to have my big brother back.


558
0:39:49,887 --> 0:39:55,434
Oh, man. My man, Antoine.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!


559
0:39:55,434 --> 0:39:59,188
Oh, kid. It's is so good to see you.


560
0:39:59,188 --> 0:40:0,564
Tell me something I don't know.


561
0:40:0,564 --> 0:40:2,733
Folks, as the Huskies
take the floor today,


562
0:40:2,733 --> 0:40:5,569
they face Washington State
in a must-win situation.


563
0:40:5,569 --> 0:40:7,655
- Right.
- To clinch third place in the Pac-10


564
0:40:7,655 --> 0:40:11,75
and the wild-card berth
in the NCAA tourney.


565
0:40:11,75 --> 0:40:14,828
Tonight is huge, it's big, it's humongous.
It's Marlon Brando, I'll tell ya.


566
0:40:14,828 --> 0:40:17,164
It won't be easy, because
when the Cougars come here


567
0:40:17,164 --> 0:40:19,917
- to the Dawg House, they come to play.
- Who doesn't, Ernie?


568
0:40:19,917 --> 0:40:22,419
Unless the Huskies
have lady luck on their side,


569
0:40:22,419 --> 0:40:25,89
it's liable to be the end
of another long, disappointing season.


570
0:40:25,89 --> 0:40:27,7
- Long, disappointing season.
- Sure is.


571
0:40:27,7 --> 0:40:29,385
- Here we go. Let's huddle.
- All right. Let's go.


572
0:40:29,385 --> 0:40:30,845
- Bring it in.
- Hustle up!


573
0:40:30,845 --> 0:40:33,18
OK. OK, guys, here we go.


574
0:40:33,18 --> 0:40:35,724
Now remember, we just
gotta play our game, OK?


575
0:40:35,724 --> 0:40:37,56
Don't let them dictate the tempo.


576
0:40:37,56 --> 0:40:40,729
All we gotta do is put the biscuit
in the basket, the noodles in the soup,


577
0:40:40,729 --> 0:40:43,691
the cookies in the milk, the beef in theů


578
0:40:43,691 --> 0:40:47,444
You said you wanted me to be
a little bit more verbal, Coach.


579
0:40:47,444 --> 0:40:48,571
And when we get a leadů


580
0:40:48,571 --> 0:40:51,949
Hey, Kenny. If we win this one,
we go to the tournament.


581
0:40:51,949 --> 0:40:53,742
- You nervous, kid?
- Hell, no.


582
0:40:53,742 --> 0:40:56,745
Kenny, you got a problem
with running the press?


583
0:40:56,745 --> 0:41:0,374
Oh, no, Coach, I was just talků


584
0:41:0,374 --> 0:41:6,255
Kenny, look at this. Look at this. Huh?


585
0:41:6,255 --> 0:41:9,425
Kenny, look, I'm all thumbs. Watch. Oh!


586
0:41:9,425 --> 0:41:11,468
OK. Now I wantů


587
0:41:11,468 --> 0:41:14,513
We're gonna win this
with defense and rebounds.


588
0:41:14,513 --> 0:41:17,516
- Stop it.
- I want you to watch out forů Preston.


589
0:41:17,516 --> 0:41:19,435
- Watch this.
- Stop it.


590
0:41:19,435 --> 0:41:26,4
Hey, cutie-pie.


591
0:41:26,4 --> 0:41:34,2
Oh, shit!


592
0:41:34,2 --> 0:41:38,412
- Kenny, what are you doing?
- Huh?


593
0:41:38,412 --> 0:41:46,253
I got something in my throat, Coach.
Excuse me.


594
0:41:46,253 --> 0:41:49,6
Keep Preston off the boards.


595
0:41:49,6 --> 0:41:59,433
Water.


596
0:41:59,433 --> 0:42:2,311
Oh, I am so sorry.


597
0:42:2,311 --> 0:42:5,773
Oh, Iů Thank you.
I feel so much better now.


598
0:42:5,773 --> 0:42:8,317
Let me help you with that.


599
0:42:8,317 --> 0:42:10,653
Yeah, yeah. All right, great.


600
0:42:10,653 --> 0:42:12,821
Somebody get him a towel.
That was funny.


601
0:42:12,821 --> 0:42:14,573
What's the matter with you?


602
0:42:14,573 --> 0:42:17,785
The start of the second half,
and the Washington Cougars, 37,


603
0:42:17,785 --> 0:42:19,787
UDub Huskies, 34.


604
0:42:19,787 --> 0:42:22,122
- A three-point differential.
- That's what it is.


605
0:42:22,122 --> 0:42:25,292
LaSalle with the rebound
and over to Tyler.


606
0:42:25,292 --> 0:42:27,711
- Tyler will bring it up.
- Hit Lik. Hit Lik.


607
0:42:27,711 --> 0:42:30,881
Tyler shoots it ahead
to Major on the wingů


608
0:42:30,881 --> 0:42:32,91
Bring it, baby.


609
0:42:32,91 --> 0:42:36,929
Gonna work the baseline. He's forced
out of bounds. No, he's back in bounds.


610
0:42:36,929 --> 0:42:41,141
And a slam! Wow!
Somebody check his feet for jet packs!


611
0:42:41,141 --> 0:42:43,978
Peter Pan's in the house
and he's coming home for Christmas!


612
0:42:43,978 --> 0:42:46,313
- Here he goes and he's upů
- Oh, yowza!


613
0:42:46,313 --> 0:42:48,315
Oh! Did you see him fly?


614
0:42:48,315 --> 0:42:50,776
I'm telling you,
the video camera does not lie!


615
0:42:50,776 --> 0:42:53,904
- That was like Clyde Drexler.
- Dr J. Where you going on that?


616
0:42:53,904 --> 0:42:55,3
Michael Jordan.


617
0:42:55,3 --> 0:42:58,75
Major all over Preston.
Preston rolls inside.


618
0:42:58,75 --> 0:43:3,706
Hrbacek steps up to try to take the
charge. Train wreck. That's a foul.


619
0:43:3,706 --> 0:43:8,752
That's aů wait a minute.
No, a charge is called. Hello, Hrbacek!


620
0:43:8,752 --> 0:43:12,798
The Serb takes the charge and comes
up standing like a seven-foot statue.


621
0:43:12,798 --> 0:43:15,176
Preston outside for the three.
It looks good.


622
0:43:15,176 --> 0:43:17,52
No, it's out. Try to tip it in.


623
0:43:17,52 --> 0:43:20,222
No, not again.
It looks like a popcorn popper up there.


624
0:43:20,222 --> 0:43:23,976
- Too much English on that ball.
- It's got French, Spanish and Swahili.


625
0:43:23,976 --> 0:43:26,979
- There's 15 seconds left to the game.
- The Huskies are up by one.


626
0:43:26,979 --> 0:43:30,524
Washington has the ball. Huskies have
to keep the Cougars from scoring.


627
0:43:30,524 --> 0:43:33,861
Tyler on Davidson now
as he brings it up.


628
0:43:33,861 --> 0:43:36,739
Listen. Don't blow it.
That boy gonna go left.


629
0:43:36,739 --> 0:43:38,324
Davidson fakes left, goes right


630
0:43:38,324 --> 0:43:41,285
and leaves Tyler faked.
He drives in for an easy slam.


631
0:43:41,285 --> 0:43:45,289
- I thought you said he was going left.
- He went to our left.


632
0:43:45,289 --> 0:43:46,415
Hey, what? What?


633
0:43:46,415 --> 0:43:50,169
And Coach Pederson's gonna
call a time-out to regroup.


634
0:43:50,169 --> 0:43:52,588
- I thought you said he was going left.
- He mostly does.


635
0:43:52,588 --> 0:43:55,799
- What you mean "mostly"?
- I'm a ghost, not a psychic, all right?


636
0:43:55,799 --> 0:43:59,762
- Oh, shut up!
- Hey, hey, hey, you better watch it.


637
0:43:59,762 --> 0:44:1,764
- Stop that.
- I'll call Ghostbusters on your ass.


638
0:44:1,764 --> 0:44:3,182
You better call somebody.


639
0:44:3,182 --> 0:44:7,436
- What is Kennyů?
- Huh?


640
0:44:7,436 --> 0:44:11,148
Seven seconds to go. The Huskies' ball
as Coach Pederson draws up the play.


641
0:44:11,148 --> 0:44:14,401
You're gonna take the ball out.
Zigi, you set the screen here forů


642
0:44:14,401 --> 0:44:19,698
Go! Go!


643
0:44:19,698 --> 0:44:20,824
Go!


644
0:44:20,824 --> 0:44:23,869
Tyler'll step up
to make the in-bound pass.


645
0:44:23,869 --> 0:44:26,372
Throw it in. I'll do the rest.
Alley-oop at the basket.


646
0:44:26,372 --> 0:44:29,708
Tyler with the in-bound
to a breaking O'Grady.


647
0:44:29,708 --> 0:44:32,44
Quick pass, LaSalle.


648
0:44:32,44 --> 0:44:33,712
I got it, I got it, I got it.


649
0:44:33,712 --> 0:44:37,49
LaSalle, behind-the-back snow cone.


650
0:44:37,49 --> 0:44:43,13
Now with a one-hand
touch pass to Hrbacek.


651
0:44:43,13 --> 0:44:46,58
Between the legs of Preston.


652
0:44:46,58 --> 0:44:48,269
Major steps up,
lofts one over his shoulder.


653
0:44:48,269 --> 0:44:53,607
Kenny Tyler for the alley-oop.
It's gonna be close! Tylerů


654
0:44:53,607 --> 0:44:58,612
And he slams it home
as the clock runs out. What a win!


655
0:44:58,612 --> 0:45:3,117
The Huskies win 71 to 70. Huskies win.


656
0:45:3,117 --> 0:45:5,661
- What a game!
- Where are we going?


657
0:45:5,661 --> 0:45:7,538
- To the big dance!
- To the big show!


658
0:45:7,538 --> 0:45:11,166
The big show in the sky!


659
0:45:11,166 --> 0:45:22,553
Thank you.


660
0:45:22,553 --> 0:45:25,97
That was beautiful.


661
0:45:25,97 --> 0:45:28,35
Kenny. Kenny.
Kenny, not your game, huh?


662
0:45:28,35 --> 0:45:30,186
- Hey.
- Great finish.


663
0:45:30,186 --> 0:45:35,482
Hey, thank you. You the man, Coach.
You the man, baby.


664
0:45:35,482 --> 0:45:39,612
Yeah! English!


665
0:45:39,612 --> 0:45:42,156
Come on, man. You scared me.
You can't be doing that.


666
0:45:42,156 --> 0:45:46,243
Whoo! Tourney time, boy!


667
0:45:46,243 --> 0:46:6,222
We finally did it, kid.
We finally did it. We did it.


668
0:46:6,222 --> 0:46:18,317
We did it, kid. We did it.


669
0:46:18,317 --> 0:46:21,904
I bet you all wondering
what I'm doing, huh?


670
0:46:21,904 --> 0:46:28,577
- Personally, I'm curious.
- Well, umů Umů


671
0:46:28,577 --> 0:46:34,25
- The floor's all yours, baby.
- I was just giving myself a hug. See?


672
0:46:34,25 --> 0:46:37,2
Loving me. You know why?


673
0:46:37,2 --> 0:46:39,463
It's because I think that, you know,


674
0:46:39,463 --> 0:46:43,259
I feel really good about all that
we accomplished here today,


675
0:46:43,259 --> 0:46:47,263
and I think we should take
a moment and reflect,


676
0:46:47,263 --> 0:46:50,432
and then give ourselves a big hug.


677
0:46:50,432 --> 0:46:53,102
Yes, give yourself a hug.


678
0:46:53,102 --> 0:46:55,563
Yes, give yourself a hug.


679
0:46:55,563 --> 0:47:3,863
Wow. Doesn't that feel good? Zigi?


680
0:47:3,863 --> 0:47:6,156
- What's up with Kenny, man?
- He's just sad.


681
0:47:6,156 --> 0:47:9,869
What do you mean, he's sad?
Sadů He is nuts.


682
0:47:9,869 --> 0:47:12,705
We have to have a talk.
I'm not losing any tournament over him.


683
0:47:12,705 --> 0:47:50,75
- Let's go.
- No, he's crazy, man.


684
0:47:50,75 --> 0:47:51,994
- Hi.
- Hi.


685
0:47:51,994 --> 0:47:55,873
Um, anybody sitting there?


686
0:47:55,873 --> 0:48:1,295
- No, just that invisible man there.
- Oh. OK.


687
0:48:1,295 --> 0:48:8,594
Kenny? Sit down. He just went to class,
so you can sit now.


688
0:48:8,594 --> 0:48:14,558
Come on, sit. Sit, sit, sit.


689
0:48:14,558 --> 0:48:22,858
Damn invisible people
just keep popping up, you know.


690
0:48:22,858 --> 0:48:26,695
Soů


691
0:48:26,695 --> 0:48:31,575
I was like, you know,
wondering if maybeů


692
0:48:31,575 --> 0:48:34,703
me and youů you knowů


693
0:48:34,703 --> 0:48:37,206
- Like, me and you, right?
- Me and youů


694
0:48:37,206 --> 0:48:41,126
Like, together? Beů Damnů Umů


695
0:48:41,126 --> 0:48:44,88
If maybe, like, me and you could, likeů


696
0:48:44,88 --> 0:48:47,675
- Go out?
- Yeah?


697
0:48:47,675 --> 0:48:50,386
Yeah, why not?


698
0:48:50,386 --> 0:48:56,58
Yeah. Hell, yeah.


699
0:48:56,58 --> 0:49:0,271
You must be proud.
The team's been kicking ass.


700
0:49:0,271 --> 0:49:3,274
Oh, yeah. We've been really
hot lately, you know.


701
0:49:3,274 --> 0:49:6,485
No, you've been more than hot. It's been
weird. You know what I'm saying?


702
0:49:6,485 --> 0:49:9,53
Shots dropping in, hitting nothing
but net from no-business angles,


703
0:49:9,53 --> 0:49:12,74
guys skying with six-second hang-timeů


704
0:49:12,74 --> 0:49:16,412
Hey, well, you know, that's just
the great thing about the game.


705
0:49:16,412 --> 0:49:20,583
It's like on any given night,
anything can happen.


706
0:49:20,583 --> 0:49:25,45
Maybe.


707
0:49:25,45 --> 0:49:27,923
Damn, where you been, boy?
I've been trying to find you all day.


708
0:49:27,923 --> 0:49:30,259
- Would you stop that?
- Stop what?


709
0:49:30,259 --> 0:49:34,13
Stopů looking so good
with your bad self.


710
0:49:34,13 --> 0:49:37,141
Hey, man. This water's freezing.
My nipples is getting hard.


711
0:49:37,141 --> 0:49:40,144
Don't nobody wanna hear
about your perky nipples.


712
0:49:40,144 --> 0:49:45,566
Kenny, have you thought
about seeing someone?


713
0:49:45,566 --> 0:49:50,654
RC, trust me.
I'm seeing plenty right about now.


714
0:49:50,654 --> 0:49:54,825
- Uh-huh.
- Would youů excuse me, please?


715
0:49:54,825 --> 0:50:9,256
Kennyů


716
0:50:9,256 --> 0:50:11,967
Do me a favor. Take some advice
from your dead big brother.


717
0:50:11,967 --> 0:50:14,887
- What's that?
- Keep this girl at a distance, man.


718
0:50:14,887 --> 0:50:16,305
- Why?
- Trust me.


719
0:50:16,305 --> 0:50:19,975
Because right now, you're a hot story.
She's a reporter.


720
0:50:19,975 --> 0:50:24,271
If she breaks this story, you are the new
nut on the cover of National Enquirer.


721
0:50:24,271 --> 0:50:27,65
Hey, look, the girl ain't like that.
Hey, come on, baby. Relax.


722
0:50:27,65 --> 0:50:32,863
Relate. Release, baby. All right?
Don't be jealous just cos your prospects


723
0:50:32,863 --> 0:50:35,658
look like all the chicks
in the "Thriller" video.


724
0:50:35,658 --> 0:50:38,35
- You think that's funny?
- Necrophiliac.


725
0:50:38,35 --> 0:50:40,871
You remember how I used
to whoop your ass when we was kids?


726
0:50:40,871 --> 0:50:44,208
- Don't mess with a dead man.
- What? I ain't scared of nobody. What?


727
0:50:44,208 --> 0:50:47,711
What? What you saying, boy?
What? What? What?


728
0:50:47,711 --> 0:50:55,94
Whaů OK.


729
0:50:55,94 --> 0:50:59,89
One, two, threeů


730
0:50:59,89 --> 0:51:7,22
Get off me! Get off me.
Don't make me hurt you.


731
0:51:7,22 --> 0:51:9,191
Remember I used to put you
in the dofey?


732
0:51:9,191 --> 0:51:12,27
- No. No, not the dofey!
- It's dofey time.


733
0:51:12,27 --> 0:51:18,576
Get off me. Get off me.


734
0:51:18,576 --> 0:51:20,452
- Not the chicken wing!
- Chicken wing?


735
0:51:20,452 --> 0:51:22,37
No.


736
0:51:22,37 --> 0:51:29,753
All right, you got me. OK. All right, OK.


737
0:51:29,753 --> 0:51:32,381
All right, yeah.
How you like that, Space Ghost, huh?


738
0:51:32,381 --> 0:51:38,304
Hey, hey! Hey!


739
0:51:38,304 --> 0:51:46,437
I hateů you!


740
0:51:46,437 --> 0:51:49,648
- All right!
- Get it up, boy.


741
0:51:49,648 --> 0:51:51,233
You can't deal with me.


742
0:51:51,233 --> 0:52:6,707
Come on, Mohammed Ugly.
Come on, baby.


743
0:52:6,707 --> 0:52:15,174
Nipples!


744
0:52:15,174 --> 0:52:20,679
- Kenny!
- Hey, guys. Ow. OK. Ow, ow, ow.


745
0:52:20,679 --> 0:52:23,807
Me and the guys, we want to knowů
What's up with you, man?


746
0:52:23,807 --> 0:52:27,686
Nothing. I'm just loosening up.


747
0:52:27,686 --> 0:52:29,897
Doing a little bit of kung chi.


748
0:52:29,897 --> 0:52:32,525
- Kung chi?
- What the hell does kung chi mean?


749
0:52:32,525 --> 0:52:35,528
- Yeah, what the hell does it mean?
- Kung chi.


750
0:52:35,528 --> 0:52:38,72
- You know, kung chi, kung chi.
- Huh?


751
0:52:38,72 --> 0:52:40,407
It's an ancient oriental art form
of loosening up.


752
0:52:40,407 --> 0:52:42,493
All the sumo wrestlers do it.


753
0:52:42,493 --> 0:52:45,788
See, that's how they fit their big ass
in them little diapers.


754
0:52:45,788 --> 0:52:51,919
But for real, guys, I'm fine. I'm fine.
See, fine? Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine.


755
0:52:51,919 --> 0:52:53,587
You're buggin', man.


756
0:52:53,587 --> 0:52:55,923
Either you talk to us
or we're gonna talk to Coach.


757
0:52:55,923 --> 0:52:58,467
Coach don't say nothing
to you other than sit down.


758
0:52:58,467 --> 0:53:3,472
Would you shut up?
Listen, guys, wait, wait, listen.


759
0:53:3,472 --> 0:53:5,933
It's Antoine.


760
0:53:5,933 --> 0:53:11,313
Kennyů Big A is dead. He's gone.
You're gonna have to face it.


761
0:53:11,313 --> 0:53:14,233
- Not necessarily.
- Don't do it.


762
0:53:14,233 --> 0:53:16,986
He's back and he's right here, see?
Look at him, guys.


763
0:53:16,986 --> 0:53:19,154
- He's back.
- You need some serious help.


764
0:53:19,154 --> 0:53:21,198
- It's worse than I thought.
- You need help.


765
0:53:21,198 --> 0:53:23,409
Come on, Antoine!
You gotta tell 'em, man.


766
0:53:23,409 --> 0:53:25,995
I can't tell 'em.
This only works if I keep a low profile.


767
0:53:25,995 --> 0:53:30,624
Negro, you invisible! How much more
of a low profile you gonna get?


768
0:53:30,624 --> 0:53:32,918
- Who's he talking to?
- Let me slap him. Just once.


769
0:53:32,918 --> 0:53:35,337
- No, come here.
- Let me slap him. He'll snap out of it.


770
0:53:35,337 --> 0:53:37,548
Just grab him. Ready? Grab him.


771
0:53:37,548 --> 0:53:40,259
- Come on, guys. Wait, wait, wait.
- Grab him tight!


772
0:53:40,259 --> 0:53:43,47
Hey, man, I'm hungry. I'm going
to get some Chinese food. Bye-bye.


773
0:53:43,47 --> 0:53:46,473
Ant, you gotta do something!
Please do something, man. Please!


774
0:53:46,473 --> 0:53:48,934
- I can't hear you. I gotta go.
- You gotta show 'em!


775
0:53:48,934 --> 0:53:52,813
You the only one that can see me.


776
0:53:52,813 --> 0:53:56,567
Antoine, Antoine, please. I'll never ask
you for anything again in my life.


777
0:53:56,567 --> 0:53:59,82
Please, Antoine. Just show 'em, man.
Show 'em I'm not crazy, please?


778
0:53:59,82 --> 0:54:4,158
All right. I'll do it.


779
0:54:4,158 --> 0:54:8,287
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm gonna prove it to you.


780
0:54:8,287 --> 0:54:11,665
- Danny Partridge.
- What?


781
0:54:11,665 --> 0:54:12,791
Dunk it.


782
0:54:12,791 --> 0:54:15,2
- Bite me.
- Just do it.


783
0:54:15,2 --> 0:54:19,6
Kenny, he cannot possibly do it.
He's just too small.


784
0:54:19,6 --> 0:54:22,259
Man, who are you?
Seven foot and can't touch the rim.


785
0:54:22,259 --> 0:54:24,762
- At least I'm seven foot.
- Antoine's gonna make him do it.


786
0:54:24,762 --> 0:54:26,639
Oh, boy, here we go again.


787
0:54:26,639 --> 0:54:30,267
Danny misses the dunk, we take you
to the coach and get you some help.


788
0:54:30,267 --> 0:54:32,478
- OK. All right.
- This is stupid.


789
0:54:32,478 --> 0:54:34,146
- Go!
- Will you just do it?


790
0:54:34,146 --> 0:54:37,316
- All right.
- Come on, let's go.


791
0:54:37,316 --> 0:54:39,985
- Quit being scared. Just do it.
- Come on, white man, jump!


792
0:54:39,985 --> 0:54:44,448
Do you know how stupid this is?
This is stupid. Man, look at me.


793
0:54:44,448 --> 0:54:46,7
Do it.


794
0:54:46,7 --> 0:54:51,38
- All right.
- Come on, Opie, dunk it.


795
0:54:51,38 --> 0:55:3,259
Goddamn! Holy shit!


796
0:55:3,259 --> 0:55:6,53
See? Now do you believe me?


797
0:55:6,53 --> 0:55:10,432
Oh, he-he-he's just, um,
pumped for the tourney, that's all.


798
0:55:10,432 --> 0:55:13,561
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, this guyů


799
0:55:13,561 --> 0:55:15,604
Oh, tough crowd.


800
0:55:15,604 --> 0:55:23,904
Well, um, I have-I have been
working out a lot lately.


801
0:55:23,904 --> 0:55:26,49
Wait, hey, hey, hey, heyů


802
0:55:26,49 --> 0:56:9,45
See? See, now you done pissed him off.


803
0:56:9,45 --> 0:56:18,501
Oh, my God!


804
0:56:18,501 --> 0:56:20,878
- Oh, geez.
- I don't believe it.


805
0:56:20,878 --> 0:56:22,46
I don't believe it.


806
0:56:22,46 --> 0:56:27,927
- You better believe it, baby.
- Nice touch, baby.


807
0:56:27,927 --> 0:56:33,307
Welcome back.


808
0:56:33,307 --> 0:56:35,518
Welcome to the San Francisco Bay Area


809
0:56:35,518 --> 0:56:38,896
and the sights and sounds
of the NCAA West Regional.


810
0:56:38,896 --> 0:56:40,981
From the Oakland Memorial Coliseum,


811
0:56:40,981 --> 0:56:42,858
it's the University
of Washington Huskies


812
0:56:42,858 --> 0:56:45,69
against the Bulldogs of Fresno State.


813
0:56:45,69 --> 0:56:48,197
First though, we got a chance
to watch Harry the Husky


814
0:56:48,197 --> 0:56:51,75
as he'll perform his patented
slam-a-jam-a dunk.


815
0:56:51,75 --> 0:56:53,41
Looks like he's carrying a load.


816
0:56:53,41 --> 0:56:58,874
And the stat sheet says he is, um,
0 for 15 in the season so far.


817
0:56:58,874 --> 0:57:1,43
Come on. Here we go.


818
0:57:1,43 --> 0:57:3,796
And here he is, all set.


819
0:57:3,796 --> 0:57:6,799
He's up.


820
0:57:6,799 --> 0:57:9,885
- I hope that dog was wearing a cup.
- Yes, definitely.


821
0:57:9,885 --> 0:57:15,516
Slight miscalculation.
Go, Dawgs. Huskies!


822
0:57:15,516 --> 0:57:18,6
There's nothing like
the NCAA tournament.


823
0:57:18,6 --> 0:57:20,312
It's the most special, unbelievable event.


824
0:57:20,312 --> 0:57:23,482
The pageantry, the excitement.
I think it'll be awesome, baby.


825
0:57:23,482 --> 0:57:27,444
It wasn't too awesome for the Huskies
in their match-up with Fresno State.


826
0:57:27,444 --> 0:57:29,864
Coaches Pederson
and Tarkanian are really ready.


827
0:57:29,864 --> 0:57:32,741
But Tarkanian put the hurt on him
bigtime during the regular season.


828
0:57:32,741 --> 0:57:36,36
Blew 'em out by 20 points.
It was an M & M'er, a mismatch.


829
0:57:36,36 --> 0:57:39,331
They're loaded. They can shoot
the trifecta. They got diaper dandies.


830
0:57:39,331 --> 0:57:42,209
They got prime-time players.
They're awesome.


831
0:57:42,209 --> 0:57:48,34
Pederson better have his club ready
or it'll be Embarrassing City, baby.


832
0:57:48,34 --> 0:57:50,759
So you really like musicals a lot, huh?


833
0:57:50,759 --> 0:57:54,221
Oh, you know, when the
showboat appeared, it was magic.


834
0:57:54,221 --> 0:57:57,433
- Hey, St John, how ya doing?
- Great.


835
0:57:57,433 --> 0:57:59,81
See you got all dressed up
for the tournament.


836
0:57:59,81 --> 0:58:4,44
You like that? I like to look nice.
Hey, Gertz, why don't you take a stroll?


837
0:58:4,44 --> 0:58:9,111
Get yourself a complimentary hot dog.
I'm gonna talk to our friend here, OK?


838
0:58:9,111 --> 0:58:11,322
- What for?
- I'm shy.


839
0:58:11,322 --> 0:58:22,958
What do you care? Just go do it.
Today. While we're young.


840
0:58:22,958 --> 0:58:24,919
- So.
- Soů


841
0:58:24,919 --> 0:58:28,506
You and Kenny are pretty close, huh?


842
0:58:28,506 --> 0:58:31,91
- We've talked a few times.
- Yeah.


843
0:58:31,91 --> 0:58:35,12
- But that doesn't mean thatů
- No, no, no. Hey. Relax, relax.


844
0:58:35,12 --> 0:58:38,432
I know you're both adults,
and what you guys do during recess


845
0:58:38,432 --> 0:58:42,728
is no business of mine.


846
0:58:42,728 --> 0:58:46,774
Anyway, the thing is, there's
something going on with this team.


847
0:58:46,774 --> 0:58:49,193
I have a feeling Kenny's
got something to do with it.


848
0:58:49,193 --> 0:58:51,362
Hm. What are you
getting at, Mikulski?


849
0:58:51,362 --> 0:58:56,325
What I'm getting at is something
you ain't got: a break.


850
0:58:56,325 --> 0:58:59,87
Now if there's a story here
and you drop the dime,


851
0:58:59,87 --> 0:59:6,919
you know, it could be the cover
of Sporting News.


852
0:59:6,919 --> 0:59:12,466
- What do I have to do?
- Whatever it takes to get the story.


853
0:59:12,466 --> 0:59:15,636
Grab yourself a cold one
and hold on to the armrest, folks,


854
0:59:15,636 --> 0:59:19,723
cos it's game time. So the Huskies
and the Bulldogs set to square off.


855
0:59:19,723 --> 0:59:23,18
And Hrbacek will tip off
against O'Neil of Fresno State.


856
0:59:23,18 --> 0:59:26,647
O'Neil, you recall, earlier in the regular
season involved in an altercation


857
0:59:26,647 --> 0:59:29,66
with Kenny Tyler that resulted
in Tyler's ejection.


858
0:59:29,66 --> 0:59:32,194
Up, and controlled by Hrbacek
over to Tyler.


859
0:59:32,194 --> 0:59:34,989
He'll bring it up, guarded by Seymor.


860
0:59:34,989 --> 0:59:39,326
- Hey, hey. Start it off right.
- Come on, get a life. Leave me alone.


861
0:59:39,326 --> 0:59:42,58
- Let's go to Zigi for a three-pointer.
- Zigi can't shoot no three-pointer.


862
0:59:42,58 --> 0:59:46,292
- Hey, just do what I say, Kenny.
- Zig.


863
0:59:46,292 --> 0:59:50,45
Tyler, the dish to Hrbacek
way outside the three-point line.


864
0:59:50,45 --> 0:59:53,674
He's 0 for 12 outside
the arc this season.


865
0:59:53,674 --> 0:59:55,801
- Zigi, what the hell are youů?
- Do it, Zigi.


866
0:59:55,801 --> 0:59:59,597
- Zigi for threeů He got it!
- I can't believe it! Zigi goes downtown!


867
0:59:59,597 --> 1:0:4,977
Nice shot.


868
1:0:4,977 --> 1:0:8,23
This Serb is going long-distance.
Somebody call MCI.


869
1:0:8,23 --> 1:0:9,94
I mean, he deserves a discount.


870
1:0:9,94 --> 1:0:11,984
- You've been working with him?
- I, uhů


871
1:0:11,984 --> 1:0:14,612
- Good work, Coach.
- Thanks.


872
1:0:14,612 --> 1:0:17,489
Peabody brings it up,
guarded by O'Grady.


873
1:0:17,489 --> 1:0:19,658
Tark will call the play.


874
1:0:19,658 --> 1:0:22,286
Peabody over to Seymor.
Seymor, O'Neil.


875
1:0:22,286 --> 1:0:26,665
And a drive and a slam over Zigi.
And the foul. And now tempers flare.


876
1:0:26,665 --> 1:0:28,667
Malik, he better watch it. He'll get a T.


877
1:0:28,667 --> 1:0:31,462
Tyler now steps in to try
to calm things down,


878
1:0:31,462 --> 1:0:34,173
and there's no love lost
between those two.


879
1:0:34,173 --> 1:0:37,301
Better be careful. Big brother ain't here
to protect your ass no more.


880
1:0:37,301 --> 1:0:39,261
- What?
- Come on, bring it, little girl.


881
1:0:39,261 --> 1:0:40,763
- That's bullshit!
- Excuse me?


882
1:0:40,763 --> 1:0:42,306
I should head-butt you like Rodman.


883
1:0:42,306 --> 1:0:43,974
- What's that?
- All right, easy.


884
1:0:43,974 --> 1:0:46,477
O'Neil, known for his bad-boy ways.


885
1:0:46,477 --> 1:0:48,938
A regular Dennis Rodman in the making,


886
1:0:48,938 --> 1:0:52,733
but tonight he's more like Dennis
the Menace, out there looking for trouble.


887
1:0:52,733 --> 1:0:57,112
- Pour it in now, pour it in.
- Hey.


888
1:0:57,112 --> 1:1:0,616
- Whoo! Ooh!
- Shoot!


889
1:1:0,616 --> 1:1:5,246
Drops back like a quarterback and
he rifles a line drive off the backboardů


890
1:1:5,246 --> 1:1:10,543
Whoa. This ball is sailing,
sailing into the rafters.


891
1:1:10,543 --> 1:1:14,88
Somebody call 911.
This boy needs a doctor.


892
1:1:14,88 --> 1:1:18,592
Oh, yeah. That happens
on this planet all the time.


893
1:1:18,592 --> 1:1:21,47
What the hell are you doing?
Keep your head in the game.


894
1:1:21,47 --> 1:1:24,348
O'Neil left to ponder whether
he should've been trying outů


895
1:1:24,348 --> 1:1:27,81
- The ballů It went upů
- What?


896
1:1:27,81 --> 1:1:33,357
Huskies by nine now,
as we wind down here in the first half.


897
1:1:33,357 --> 1:1:37,486
Seymor brings it up, guarded by Major.


898
1:1:37,486 --> 1:1:40,573
O'Neil pushes Tyler.
That looks like a foul.


899
1:1:40,573 --> 1:1:46,245
And Seymor dishes
to O'Neil on the wing.


900
1:1:46,245 --> 1:1:49,582
You better leave my brother the hell
alone! And get your thumb outta my eye!


901
1:1:49,582 --> 1:1:52,293
And O'Neil turns it over on purpose.


902
1:1:52,293 --> 1:1:54,211
This boy has flipped his lid.


903
1:1:54,211 --> 1:1:58,215
Somebody call Bellevue
and see if there's a vacancy.


904
1:1:58,215 --> 1:1:59,341
Time-out.


905
1:1:59,341 --> 1:2:3,762
So a major upset. 76-61. Dick, you
and I have seen a lot of strange games.


906
1:2:3,762 --> 1:2:6,515
- This one was wild.
- I can't believe it. I mean, I'm stunned.


907
1:2:6,515 --> 1:2:8,184
Tarkanian's gonna be shocked.


908
1:2:8,184 --> 1:2:12,646
Look at the stats, Brad.
36 by Kenny Tyler. He was super.


909
1:2:12,646 --> 1:2:17,234
I mean, he was a PTP'er. Pederson
is on cloud nine. Tarkanian's crying.


910
1:2:17,234 --> 1:2:21,697
They wield some unbelievable
canine magic today, the Huskies.


911
1:2:21,697 --> 1:2:23,115
- Whoo!
- All right.


912
1:2:23,115 --> 1:2:25,993
- That's it, baby. Give me some!
- Chill. Chill.


913
1:2:25,993 --> 1:2:28,454
That's the way we do it, boy.
A and K all the way.


914
1:2:28,454 --> 1:2:31,29
- You know it, baby.
- Why don't we celebrate? Get grub.


915
1:2:31,29 --> 1:2:34,71
Or better yet, let's go to the cemetery,
see if I can get laid. I need some action.


916
1:2:34,71 --> 1:2:39,632
You know what? That sounds great,
but I think I'm gonna be busy tonight, bro.


917
1:2:39,632 --> 1:3:5,95
Oh, come on. Hey, Kenny, man.
Will you stopů?


918
1:3:5,95 --> 1:3:16,502
- We'll play that basketball.
- Yeah!


919
1:3:16,502 --> 1:3:19,338
Oh, no, I couldn't. I couldn't. All right.


920
1:3:19,338 --> 1:3:27,721
Go, Coach! Go, Coach!
Go, Coach! Go, Coach!


921
1:3:27,721 --> 1:3:43,112
Nichols, get in here.


922
1:3:43,112 --> 1:3:46,657
- We're going to the tournament!
- Yeah!


923
1:3:46,657 --> 1:3:50,494
One time, right,
my mom was being thrifty,


924
1:3:50,494 --> 1:3:53,497
and she went to Kmart
and bought us these cheap-ass shoes.


925
1:3:53,497 --> 1:3:56,584
- Stop.
- I couldn't tell the left from the right.


926
1:3:56,584 --> 1:4:1,38
They were like some
ambidextrous shoes. It was hilarious.


927
1:4:1,38 --> 1:4:8,345
Oh, man. Oh, God. Antoine.
That's my man.


928
1:4:8,345 --> 1:4:10,55
- Soů
- So.


929
1:4:10,55 --> 1:4:13,184
- We were talking about the game.
- Right.


930
1:4:13,184 --> 1:4:15,686
Have you been doing anything special?
Wearing lucky socks?


931
1:4:15,686 --> 1:4:19,523
Carrying a rabbit's foot?


932
1:4:19,523 --> 1:4:30,75
Taking anything?


933
1:4:30,75 --> 1:4:34,413
What do you mean, taking anything?


934
1:4:34,413 --> 1:4:42,588
I've just never seen
a team play like this before, it'sů


935
1:4:42,588 --> 1:4:45,966
So we gotta be on something?


936
1:4:45,966 --> 1:4:50,54
No. I didn't mean for it
to pop out like that.


937
1:4:50,54 --> 1:4:51,514
There it is. That's her headline.


938
1:4:51,514 --> 1:4:53,516
"Huskies Shooting Up",
"Dawgs on Dope".


939
1:4:53,516 --> 1:4:55,684
- Shut up.
- You're the only one that can hear me.


940
1:4:55,684 --> 1:5:1,398
So hear me, Kenny. Kenny. Move.


941
1:5:1,398 --> 1:5:8,489
- So what are you trying to say?
- I'm just, umů


942
1:5:8,489 --> 1:5:10,407
She babbling. She's stuttering.


943
1:5:10,407 --> 1:5:13,994
- Why are we talking like this?
- She ain't giving you no ass.


944
1:5:13,994 --> 1:5:16,497
- No reason.
- Stop that corny smile.


945
1:5:16,497 --> 1:5:19,959
- It's just that you look so bů
- Stop that. Don't get corny.


946
1:5:19,959 --> 1:5:21,752
..beautiful from this angle.


947
1:5:21,752 --> 1:5:25,256
Oh, you ain't gotta work that hard.
You ain't getting no ass.


948
1:5:25,256 --> 1:5:29,26
- Excuse me. Gotta go to the bathroom.
- There is no rhythm.


949
1:5:29,26 --> 1:5:31,387
Look, we've been through a lot together,


950
1:5:31,387 --> 1:5:34,223
and I love you more
than anything in this world,


951
1:5:34,223 --> 1:5:39,19
but you gotta stop popping up
all the time wanting to play.


952
1:5:39,19 --> 1:5:42,94
I'm on a date.
I can't play with you right now.


953
1:5:42,94 --> 1:5:48,904
Gosh. Why are you making it so hard?
People are starting to stare at me.


954
1:5:48,904 --> 1:5:52,825
- You know something?
- Hey!


955
1:5:52,825 --> 1:5:55,369
I have the same problem.


956
1:5:55,369 --> 1:6:1,917
Trust me. My problem's
a lot bigger than yours.


957
1:6:1,917 --> 1:6:4,503
Yeah.


958
1:6:4,503 --> 1:6:7,84
Oh, no, wait, my man. I'm not talking
aboutů Not that kind of problem.


959
1:6:7,84 --> 1:6:9,508
- That's not funny.
- You hurt him.


960
1:6:9,508 --> 1:6:11,218
He thinks I'm talking to my piece.


961
1:6:11,218 --> 1:6:13,679
You was having a little conversation
with your piece.


962
1:6:13,679 --> 1:6:16,932
- A little conversation piece.
- Conversationů OK.


963
1:6:16,932 --> 1:6:21,645
When I'm locked up in Bellevue,
I'm blaming you, OK?


964
1:6:21,645 --> 1:6:25,482
Great, the food is here.
I am starving.


965
1:6:25,482 --> 1:6:28,277
Look, Kenny, I didn't mean
to accuse you of anything.


966
1:6:28,277 --> 1:6:31,3
Oh, girl, stop it. We cool.
Don't worry about it.


967
1:6:31,3 --> 1:6:32,615
But there's been a lot of weirdů


968
1:6:32,615 --> 1:6:37,161
Weird? Nah. I didn't notice anything
weird happening. You trippin'.


969
1:6:37,161 --> 1:6:42,917
It's not just for steak any more.


970
1:6:42,917 --> 1:6:48,47
Steak sauce. Mmm.


971
1:6:48,47 --> 1:6:53,761
- Steak sauceů Mmm, mmm, mmm.
- Yes. Yeah.


972
1:6:53,761 --> 1:6:58,57
I love me some steak sauce.


973
1:6:58,57 --> 1:7:0,809
On salmon?


974
1:7:0,809 --> 1:7:4,813
Oh, yeah. It gives it that,
uh, nice, zesty, tangy flavor.


975
1:7:4,813 --> 1:7:12,154
Oh, that's gonna be good. Enjoy.


976
1:7:12,154 --> 1:7:17,76
- Mmm, mmm, mmmů
- Ooh. Gets you right back here, right?


977
1:7:17,76 --> 1:7:22,831
Gets you right back in the throat?


978
1:7:22,831 --> 1:7:28,629
Need some water?
Need some water? Ooh.


979
1:7:28,629 --> 1:7:35,427
Slow, slow, slow. Drink.


980
1:7:35,427 --> 1:7:37,638
- Thirsty?
- Yeah.


981
1:7:37,638 --> 1:7:44,228
- Yes. Yes. Sexy.
- I'm sorry, I'm just soů so hungry.


982
1:7:44,228 --> 1:7:53,612
Would you like some zesty salmon?
You sure?


983
1:7:53,612 --> 1:7:58,284
So, I had an interesting time tonight.


984
1:7:58,284 --> 1:8:5,207
Well, I had a pretty
interesting time myself.


985
1:8:5,207 --> 1:8:11,5
That's me.


986
1:8:11,5 --> 1:8:23,17
It's late.


987
1:8:23,17 --> 1:8:28,898
No. No, no, no.


988
1:8:28,898 --> 1:8:33,36
Put that thing back in your mouth.


989
1:8:33,36 --> 1:8:37,239
Maybe, um, maybe we're
rushing things a little bit.


990
1:8:37,239 --> 1:8:45,122
Yeah, maybe we're rushing things
a little bit. Maybe we areů


991
1:8:45,122 --> 1:8:46,999
- So embarrassing.
-ůrushing things.


992
1:8:46,999 --> 1:8:50,169
Yeah.


993
1:8:50,169 --> 1:9:0,346
Nowů take it easy.


994
1:9:0,346 --> 1:9:1,472
What was that?


995
1:9:1,472 --> 1:9:5,59
- It was stupid and embarrassing.
- I like to kiss on the move.


996
1:9:5,59 --> 1:9:7,937
- Oh, really?
- It's freaky.


997
1:9:7,937 --> 1:9:15,653
Oh, OK. It takes some getting used to.


998
1:9:15,653 --> 1:9:18,3
- OK, I think I better go.
- Oh, OK.


999
1:9:18,3 --> 1:9:19,907
- Yeah. OK.
- All right.


1000
1:9:19,907 --> 1:9:22,743
All right. OK, yeah.


1001
1:9:22,743 --> 1:9:24,828
- Bye.
- Bye.


1002
1:9:24,828 --> 1:9:26,997
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?


1003
1:9:26,997 --> 1:9:28,624
- Crybaby.
- Mind your business.


1004
1:9:28,624 --> 1:9:31,168
- Mind your business.
- You have no right doing that.


1005
1:9:31,168 --> 1:9:33,254
I don't wanna hear it.
I don't wanna hear it.


1006
1:9:33,254 --> 1:9:36,9
- Mind your business, man!
- You mind your business.


1007
1:9:36,9 --> 1:9:40,94
- Got no business telling me what to do.
- Kenny? Kenny, what's going on?


1008
1:9:40,94 --> 1:9:43,389
- Hey, Coach.
- Who are you talking to?


1009
1:9:43,389 --> 1:9:45,224
- Uhů
- Kenny.


1010
1:9:45,224 --> 1:9:47,268
- He'll glue your ass to the bench.
- Shut up!


1011
1:9:47,268 --> 1:9:49,61
I'm your Coach.
Don't talk to me that way.


1012
1:9:49,61 --> 1:9:50,771
You shouldn't have called me back.


1013
1:9:50,771 --> 1:9:54,4
- Well, maybe I'm sorry I did.
- All right then. I accept your apology.


1014
1:9:54,4 --> 1:9:56,151
- If you want me gone, I'm gone.
- Good.


1015
1:9:56,151 --> 1:9:59,113
Look. Look, Kenny, I'm not trying
to come down on you here.


1016
1:9:59,113 --> 1:10:1,657
- I'm just trying to help you here.
- Fuck it, I'm gone then!


1017
1:10:1,657 --> 1:10:4,952
- Good. Good.
- I'm gone!


1018
1:10:4,952 --> 1:10:7,746
- Kenny?
- You gonna be sorry. You need me!


1019
1:10:7,746 --> 1:10:10,249
What you doing?
You ain't gonna catch shit in here!


1020
1:10:10,249 --> 1:10:12,376
Stupid Frenchman. Get on my nerves.


1021
1:10:12,376 --> 1:10:17,214
Kenny? Just tell me
what's going on here.


1022
1:10:17,214 --> 1:10:27,6
Trust me, Coach.
You wouldn't understand.


1023
1:10:27,6 --> 1:10:32,771
Antoine?


1024
1:10:32,771 --> 1:10:37,568
Ant, I just wanted to say I'm sorry.


1025
1:10:37,568 --> 1:10:41,697
I didn't mean it, man.


1026
1:10:41,697 --> 1:10:49,163
You know that, right?


1027
1:10:49,163 --> 1:11:3,302
I know you didn't mean it. Crybaby.


1028
1:11:3,302 --> 1:11:6,96
Storm clouds continue
to brew from the Northwest.


1029
1:11:6,96 --> 1:11:8,682
What a story this has become
for the UW Huskies.


1030
1:11:8,682 --> 1:11:11,936
Their little guy Danny O'Grady
elevates his game to a new level.


1031
1:11:11,936 --> 1:11:14,21
So does his team,
as Coach Pederson's squad


1032
1:11:14,21 --> 1:11:16,941
upsets Dean Smith's
North Carolina Tar Heels,


1033
1:11:16,941 --> 1:11:19,401
sends the Heels packing
back to Chapel Hill.


1034
1:11:19,401 --> 1:11:21,362
For the Huskies, it's on to the Sweet 16.


1035
1:11:21,362 --> 1:11:24,281
O'Grady brings it up
into the front court, and the dishů


1036
1:11:24,281 --> 1:11:31,372
Zigi on the drive and the lay-in.
And Hrbacek's got 15.


1037
1:11:31,372 --> 1:11:33,666
Unbelievable!
A street brawl took place!


1038
1:11:33,666 --> 1:11:37,86
The Arkansas Razorbacks
cut themselves to shreds!


1039
1:11:37,86 --> 1:11:41,507
Three of their five starters were rejected
for fighting - with themselves!


1040
1:11:41,507 --> 1:11:43,8
How wacky can you get?


1041
1:11:43,8 --> 1:11:46,804
And their coach, Nolan Richardson,
he was sent to the showers, baby,


1042
1:11:46,804 --> 1:11:50,391
allowing the UW Huskies
to march on to the great A.


1043
1:11:50,391 --> 1:11:53,227
Husky hysteria's going wild.


1044
1:11:53,227 --> 1:11:56,272
So the clock's stopped.
3:20 remaining in the ballgame.


1045
1:11:56,272 --> 1:11:59,817
70-63 the Huskies, Dick, and they're
clinging to that seven-point advantage.


1046
1:11:59,817 --> 1:12:1,443
Well, Tito gets a TO, baby.


1047
1:12:1,443 --> 1:12:4,29
Right now, it's Maalox-mashing
time for both coaches.


1048
1:12:4,29 --> 1:12:6,907
Tito's talking to his team, sayin'
"We gotta speed up the tempo."


1049
1:12:6,907 --> 1:12:9,368
Pederson says "We gotta
spread out and slow it down."


1050
1:12:9,368 --> 1:12:12,413
OK, now, Danny and Kenny,
you keep that ball on the perimeter, OK?


1051
1:12:12,413 --> 1:12:16,25
And, guys, use the clock. Use that clock,
all right? Come on, let's go.


1052
1:12:16,25 --> 1:12:21,5
Let's go. One, two, threeů


1053
1:12:21,5 --> 1:12:22,798
UDub Huskies' ball.


1054
1:12:22,798 --> 1:12:26,427
Let's look for Major now to be
the triggerman on the in-bound.


1055
1:12:26,427 --> 1:12:28,721
Kirk will step up and force the press.


1056
1:12:28,721 --> 1:12:31,432
Wildcats in desperate
need of a turnover.


1057
1:12:31,432 --> 1:12:34,727
Major into O'Grady. And the little guy
will bring it up for the Dawgs.


1058
1:12:34,727 --> 1:12:38,522
And Marlowe covers him stride
for stride all the way up-court.


1059
1:12:38,522 --> 1:12:41,442
Four corners. Work the clock, guys.
Work it, work it!


1060
1:12:41,442 --> 1:12:45,863
O'Grady taking his time, working
that clock. Now crosscourt to Tyler.


1061
1:12:45,863 --> 1:12:48,365
- Throw an alley-oop to Luther.
- I can't. Coach saidů


1062
1:12:48,365 --> 1:12:50,951
Coach, my ass. Just do what I said.
I'm running this team.


1063
1:12:50,951 --> 1:12:54,58
And look for Tyler now to try to run
a four-corner slow-down offence.


1064
1:12:54,58 --> 1:13:0,836
He looks inside, fakes and now
he'll toss an alley-oop to LaSalle.


1065
1:13:0,836 --> 1:13:5,591
But LaSalle steamrolls Kirk
in the process.


1066
1:13:5,591 --> 1:13:9,803
And that is a foul. Charging call on Luther
LaSalle, Dick, and that's number five.


1067
1:13:9,803 --> 1:13:13,224
Wow. He's the big stork.
Goes to the sideline on a charge.


1068
1:13:13,224 --> 1:13:16,393
- Who they gonna put in?
- They'll have to go with Jimmy Stubbs.


1069
1:13:16,393 --> 1:13:17,978
- Who?
- Jimmy Stubbs.


1070
1:13:17,978 --> 1:13:22,942
- Jimmy who?
- Come on, move it, move it. Let's go!


1071
1:13:22,942 --> 1:13:25,569
- You call that using the clock?
- No, Coach, butů


1072
1:13:25,569 --> 1:13:28,739
Four fouls, you let yourself get called
for a charge? Sit down!


1073
1:13:28,739 --> 1:13:29,949
- Coachů
- Sit down!


1074
1:13:29,949 --> 1:13:31,158
- Sit down.
- Jimmy?


1075
1:13:31,158 --> 1:13:32,91
- Huh?
- You're going in.


1076
1:13:32,91 --> 1:13:34,36
- Who, me?
- Yeah.


1077
1:13:34,36 --> 1:13:36,288
Thank you. You will not be disappointed.


1078
1:13:36,288 --> 1:13:42,211
Nichols, huh?
Always looking out for a brother.


1079
1:13:42,211 --> 1:13:43,754
Lu, I just wanna say I'm sorryů


1080
1:13:43,754 --> 1:13:49,51
Get off me! And tell your damn
brother to get off me, too!


1081
1:13:49,51 --> 1:13:52,388
Whoo! Did you see that, boy?
Did you see me?


1082
1:13:52,388 --> 1:13:54,89
It was like old times.
Did you see how high I was, kid?


1083
1:13:54,89 --> 1:13:57,768
Ant, I ain't in the mood, man.
Leave me alone, all right?


1084
1:13:57,768 --> 1:14:1,63
- What?
- You buggin'. You're going too far.


1085
1:14:1,63 --> 1:14:6,235
I'm going to the Final Four, son.
I don't know where you going.


1086
1:14:6,235 --> 1:14:15,244
Another Husky shocker.
90-71, a 19-point win over Kentucky.


1087
1:14:15,244 --> 1:14:18,831
Excuse me. Kenny? Excuse me, baby.


1088
1:14:18,831 --> 1:14:22,793
Don't eat the cake till I get back. Kenny?


1089
1:14:22,793 --> 1:14:26,422
Where you at, Murphy? Whoo!


1090
1:14:26,422 --> 1:14:30,342
- Nice shot.
- Hey. Hey, what's up, Ma?


1091
1:14:30,342 --> 1:14:35,931
Whooů I remember when
you made that foul line.


1092
1:14:35,931 --> 1:14:38,309
I bought the paint.


1093
1:14:38,309 --> 1:14:42,313
You got sick of us drawing it
with your lipstick.


1094
1:14:42,313 --> 1:14:46,901
I, umů caught myself trying
to die a little with Antoine.


1095
1:14:46,901 --> 1:14:51,28
- Oh, Mom.
- Butů you wouldn't let me.


1096
1:14:51,28 --> 1:14:56,66
I watch you out thereů
alive and playing,


1097
1:14:56,66 --> 1:15:3,209
and, oh, God, it'sů
almost like he's right there beside you.


1098
1:15:3,209 --> 1:15:7,338
Honey, I don't know what's gonna
happen in New York and I don't care.


1099
1:15:7,338 --> 1:15:10,758
I just wanna say thank you, baby.


1100
1:15:10,758 --> 1:15:20,809
I just wish your daddy was here.
Ooh. He would be so proud of you.


1101
1:15:20,809 --> 1:15:23,62
- Who's your baby girl?
- You, Ma.


1102
1:15:23,62 --> 1:15:26,65
You better believe it.


1103
1:15:26,65 --> 1:15:27,983
Let's go inside. Uncle Jake's waiting.


1104
1:15:27,983 --> 1:15:29,735
- Oh, no, not Uncle Jake.
- Oh, yeah.


1105
1:15:29,735 --> 1:15:33,781
Ma, that man ain't got no teeth,
but always wants something to eat.


1106
1:15:33,781 --> 1:15:38,16
Look for Tyler now to try to run
a four-corner slow-down offence.


1107
1:15:38,16 --> 1:15:42,748
He looks insideů


1108
1:15:42,748 --> 1:15:45,334
- Yeah?
- Never eat a pizza after a burrito. Man!


1109
1:15:45,334 --> 1:15:46,794
What do you want, Mikulski?


1110
1:15:46,794 --> 1:15:48,45
- Talk to him?
- Yeah.


1111
1:15:48,45 --> 1:15:51,632
- What did you find out?
- Look, there's nothing to find out.


1112
1:15:51,632 --> 1:15:54,426
Mikulski, I gotta get back to this,
so if you don't mind,


1113
1:15:54,426 --> 1:15:56,53
I'd like for you to just leave meů


1114
1:15:56,53 --> 1:16:0,182
- Hello? RC, are you there?
-ůalone.


1115
1:16:0,182 --> 1:16:13,237
I can't believe it. Listen to meů


1116
1:16:13,237 --> 1:16:23,873
LaSalle steamrolls Kirk in the process.


1117
1:16:23,873 --> 1:16:27,1
Luther, you didn't evenů


1118
1:16:27,1 --> 1:16:42,433
You didn't even touch the ball.


1119
1:16:42,433 --> 1:16:44,685
Tell yourů


1120
1:16:44,685 --> 1:17:3,913
Tell your damn brother to get off me?


1121
1:17:3,913 --> 1:17:6,373
Yeah?


1122
1:17:6,373 --> 1:17:9,335
- Hey, what's up, Kenny?
- What's up, dog? What's poppin'?


1123
1:17:9,335 --> 1:17:13,339
Is it cool if we talk for a minute?
Is it cool I come in?


1124
1:17:13,339 --> 1:17:14,924
Yeah, come on.


1125
1:17:14,924 --> 1:17:17,635
- Come on, y'all, damn!
- Stop pushing!


1126
1:17:17,635 --> 1:17:21,347
- When I said "we", I meant the team.
- Damn.


1127
1:17:21,347 --> 1:17:24,266
- Is he here? Is Antoine here?
- Yeah, he's in the shower.


1128
1:17:24,266 --> 1:17:27,394
Dead people usually don't
take showers, Kenny.


1129
1:17:27,394 --> 1:17:32,983
And how many dead people
do you know, Zigi?


1130
1:17:32,983 --> 1:17:34,985
- Not too many.
- All right then.


1131
1:17:34,985 --> 1:17:40,74
What's up?
What y'all wanna talk about?


1132
1:17:40,74 --> 1:17:43,452
- Tell him. Come on.
- It's Antoine.


1133
1:17:43,452 --> 1:17:44,87
Yeah, what about him?


1134
1:17:44,87 --> 1:17:49,75
We don't want to play with him
any more. I mean, it feels wrong.


1135
1:17:49,75 --> 1:17:52,67
Yeah, just tell him to chill.
Maybe come sit on the bench with me.


1136
1:17:52,67 --> 1:17:56,507
Look, personally, I'm averaging 18
points a game since he's come back,


1137
1:17:56,507 --> 1:17:58,676
so I really don't give a shit, all right?


1138
1:17:58,676 --> 1:18:4,56
Look, look, look, look, look. He's a ball
hog. He was when he was alive.


1139
1:18:4,56 --> 1:18:10,771
And no disrespect,
he's even worse as a dead man.


1140
1:18:10,771 --> 1:18:22,908
He didn't hear us, did he?


1141
1:18:22,908 --> 1:18:25,119
- I think it's him.
- Me, too.


1142
1:18:25,119 --> 1:18:27,997
I still got that embalming fluid
in my ears. I can't getů


1143
1:18:27,997 --> 1:18:30,541
- Hi, Antoine.
- Calm down. Say it.


1144
1:18:30,541 --> 1:18:33,169
What's this? This looks like
some kind of lynch mob.


1145
1:18:33,169 --> 1:18:35,129
- Go ahead. Tell him.
- Huh?


1146
1:18:35,129 --> 1:18:36,839
- Just do it.
- You tell him, Luther.


1147
1:18:36,839 --> 1:18:39,133
Tell me what?
What are they talking about, Kenny?


1148
1:18:39,133 --> 1:18:42,94
I ain't telling him. You tell him, Jimmy.
It was your bright idea.


1149
1:18:42,94 --> 1:18:44,597
You're lying through
the space in your teeth.


1150
1:18:44,597 --> 1:18:50,436
- Talk to me, Kenny.
- They want you off the team, Ant.


1151
1:18:50,436 --> 1:18:53,898
Off the team? Me?
You want me off the team?!


1152
1:18:53,898 --> 1:18:59,153
Let me tell you something! You don't
tell me shit! You don't tell me shit!


1153
1:18:59,153 --> 1:19:4,158
- None of you!
- Antoine, chill!


1154
1:19:4,158 --> 1:19:8,162
- Shut up!
- Uh-oh. I think we pissed him off.


1155
1:19:8,162 --> 1:19:12,208
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Look, it's nothing personal.


1156
1:19:12,208 --> 1:19:15,669
- Nothing personal?!
- Don't throw that!


1157
1:19:15,669 --> 1:19:19,798
Nothing personal?! Nothing personal?!


1158
1:19:19,798 --> 1:19:24,97
I raised all your games to another level!
Me! I did that!


1159
1:19:24,97 --> 1:19:30,601
You on TV! You getting scouted!
Zigi, you might go lottery! I got that for you!


1160
1:19:30,601 --> 1:19:34,772
And this is the thanks I get?
You make me sick.


1161
1:19:34,772 --> 1:19:39,985
Uh, Antoine, if they don't want you
to use them, use me. I can see it now.


1162
1:19:39,985 --> 1:19:43,739
22 assists, 34 points, and ten boards.


1163
1:19:43,739 --> 1:19:46,867
Together we can win tournament MVP.
Sounds good?


1164
1:19:46,867 --> 1:19:49,328
- Man, shut up, Malik!
- I'm trying to go pro!


1165
1:19:49,328 --> 1:19:54,959
Kenny, I never wanted to die.
I had things I wanted to do. I had plans.


1166
1:19:54,959 --> 1:19:56,502
I know, man.


1167
1:19:56,502 --> 1:20:15,729
If you want me to go,
you just tell me and I'm gone.


1168
1:20:15,729 --> 1:20:19,567
Jimmy, this is my brother, and, umů


1169
1:20:19,567 --> 1:20:22,945
..if he wants to stay, then he stays.


1170
1:20:22,945 --> 1:20:25,99
- OK, let's take it in.
- Let's go, Huskies.


1171
1:20:25,99 --> 1:20:30,35
RC. RC. Hey.


1172
1:20:30,35 --> 1:20:32,705
Where have you been?
I've been looking for you.


1173
1:20:32,705 --> 1:20:36,0
You wasn't at the banquet last night
nor at the conference this morning.


1174
1:20:36,0 --> 1:20:38,2
- Where you at?
- Sorry, I've been busy.


1175
1:20:38,2 --> 1:20:39,461
Oh, you been writing?


1176
1:20:39,461 --> 1:20:42,715
Yes, writing, writing.
Uh, look, I have to go.


1177
1:20:42,715 --> 1:20:45,384
No, wait, RC, RCů I gotta talk to you.


1178
1:20:45,384 --> 1:20:48,47
It's really important, OK.
It's kinda difficult for me to say.


1179
1:20:48,47 --> 1:20:50,472
- You don't have to, really.
- No, I need to.


1180
1:20:50,472 --> 1:20:54,268
Sometimes things happen
that are bigger than us.


1181
1:20:54,268 --> 1:20:57,104
Things that we really can't explain.


1182
1:20:57,104 --> 1:20:59,565
Things that make absolutely
no rational senseů


1183
1:20:59,565 --> 1:21:3,319
- Kenny, you don'tů Really.
- I know this sounds crazy, believe me.


1184
1:21:3,319 --> 1:21:8,49
Butů it's about Antoine.


1185
1:21:8,49 --> 1:21:9,992
He's here.


1186
1:21:9,992 --> 1:21:12,244
Come on, Kenny.
Team meeting. Let's go.


1187
1:21:12,244 --> 1:21:14,413
OK.


1188
1:21:14,413 --> 1:21:17,374
- Sweetie, you gotta believe me, OK?
- Kenny, come on!


1189
1:21:17,374 --> 1:21:19,543
OK.


1190
1:21:19,543 --> 1:21:26,133
Coming, Coach.


1191
1:21:26,133 --> 1:21:29,345
Oh, yeah, it's a great hotel.
It's got hot water between 7 and 7.30.


1192
1:21:29,345 --> 1:21:33,349
- Here she is. You looking for me?
- Yes, I wrote this piece thatů


1193
1:21:33,349 --> 1:21:35,893
RC, this is David Gallagher,
Sporting News.


1194
1:21:35,893 --> 1:21:38,979
- Ron Hammer, the Boston Globe.
- Nice meeting you, gentlemen.


1195
1:21:38,979 --> 1:21:40,773
I wanted to talk to youů


1196
1:21:40,773 --> 1:21:43,859
Gentlemen, keep an eye on this girl,
because she has the drive.


1197
1:21:43,859 --> 1:21:47,738
You know, I think she'd sell
her own mother for a good story.


1198
1:21:47,738 --> 1:21:51,367
So, what do you got for me?
Ready to win that Pulitzer? Hm?


1199
1:21:51,367 --> 1:21:54,453
No. Not just yet anyway.


1200
1:21:54,453 --> 1:21:59,5
I got a little bit more work to do on it.
It was nice meeting you, gentlemen.


1201
1:21:59,5 --> 1:22:2,378
Wait, wait. Where are you going?


1202
1:22:2,378 --> 1:22:6,715
Come on! Come on.


1203
1:22:6,715 --> 1:22:18,561
I don't know. It must be my personality.


1204
1:22:18,561 --> 1:22:26,819
There goes the story of the year.


1205
1:22:26,819 --> 1:22:30,739
Welcome to The Meadowlands,
home of the NCAA,


1206
1:22:30,739 --> 1:22:32,908
home of college basketball's
highest honor,


1207
1:22:32,908 --> 1:22:40,249
and home of all the pageantry
and excitement that is the Final Four.


1208
1:22:40,249 --> 1:22:44,295
We kick off all the festivities
with UDub's Harry the Husky.


1209
1:22:44,295 --> 1:22:48,9
And Harry's gonna get set
for his patented slam dunk.


1210
1:22:48,9 --> 1:22:51,343
And I say "get set" because
the stat sheet doesn't look good.


1211
1:22:51,343 --> 1:22:56,765
0 for 16 on the season for Harry.
So, folks, this could get a little bit ugly.


1212
1:22:56,765 --> 1:22:58,726
- Harry's ready.
- I'm going downtown.


1213
1:22:58,726 --> 1:23:1,687
And he calls his shot ß la Babe Ruth.


1214
1:23:1,687 --> 1:23:4,94
Here we go.


1215
1:23:4,94 --> 1:23:9,82
Damn dog.


1216
1:23:9,82 --> 1:23:12,99
Oh, he got it!


1217
1:23:12,99 --> 1:23:14,533
Did you guys see that?


1218
1:23:14,533 --> 1:23:20,414
Thank you. Thank you.


1219
1:23:20,414 --> 1:23:24,251
Billy, it's gonna be a long night for the
Huskies unless they can find someone


1220
1:23:24,251 --> 1:23:27,796
to put those defensive handcuffs
on Georgetown's Jerrod Smith.


1221
1:23:27,796 --> 1:23:30,925
George, when you got a 6'5" point guard
that can go in the paint


1222
1:23:30,925 --> 1:23:34,22
and shoot the three, it's an impossible
match-up in the college level.


1223
1:23:34,22 --> 1:23:37,348
I don't think the Huskies have
another upset in 'em tonight.


1224
1:23:37,348 --> 1:23:39,475
- Kenny Tyler.
- The infamous Jerrod Smith.


1225
1:23:39,475 --> 1:23:40,726
- What's up?
- How are you?


1226
1:23:40,726 --> 1:23:43,479
- All right. How you feelin', man?
- I'm good, man. Yeah.


1227
1:23:43,479 --> 1:23:45,814
I'm really sorry to hear
about your brother.


1228
1:23:45,814 --> 1:23:49,36
- Oh, thanks, man. I appreciate that.
- I wish he was here.


1229
1:23:49,36 --> 1:23:51,362
Yeah. Me, too.


1230
1:23:51,362 --> 1:23:53,447
Get over there
and tell your team about me.


1231
1:23:53,447 --> 1:23:56,158
Aw, come on, man,
you better tell your team about me.


1232
1:23:56,158 --> 1:23:57,368
You better look up.


1233
1:23:57,368 --> 1:24:1,58
- I'm gonna get that ass, boy.
- We gonna get the ass.


1234
1:24:1,58 --> 1:24:4,75
Smith brings it up, over to Douglasů


1235
1:24:4,75 --> 1:24:6,71
- Pass, pass.
- Back over to Smith.


1236
1:24:6,71 --> 1:24:8,921
- You take it, Jerrod!
- Get on him!


1237
1:24:8,921 --> 1:24:12,132
Now Smith on the drive
at a 15-footer. Got it.


1238
1:24:12,132 --> 1:24:15,636
And that's 22 for Smith
here in the first half alone.


1239
1:24:15,636 --> 1:24:18,889
- Don't let Jerrod Smith do that.
- The Huskies just can't stop him.


1240
1:24:18,889 --> 1:24:22,768
That's 40-32 Hoyas,
as they roll on, led by Jerrod Smith.


1241
1:24:22,768 --> 1:24:25,896
Double-team Smith!
Double-team Smith!


1242
1:24:25,896 --> 1:24:29,692
Get the ball, Kenny! Get the ball!


1243
1:24:29,692 --> 1:24:33,612
- Oh, he's got the lane.
- Help out, Malik.


1244
1:24:33,612 --> 1:24:37,324
- Smith for two moreů
- Damn!


1245
1:24:37,324 --> 1:24:38,784
They're scoring at will here.


1246
1:24:38,784 --> 1:24:39,91
What are y'all doing?


1247
1:24:39,91 --> 1:24:43,706
O'Grady now will try to guard him.
Nobody else has been able to.


1248
1:24:43,706 --> 1:24:47,209
Tyler in a double-team.
Jerrod passes inside Gruck


1249
1:24:47,209 --> 1:24:50,88
and the no-look to Bergos
on the baseline. Easy deuce.


1250
1:24:50,88 --> 1:24:56,802
They call a double-team on Jerrod
and he hurts 'em in other ways.


1251
1:24:56,802 --> 1:24:58,137
Jerrod on the dribble.


1252
1:24:58,137 --> 1:25:1,515
Time to play good D. Solid D, Kenny.
Watch him, going left.


1253
1:25:1,515 --> 1:25:4,351
Slam bam, thank you ma'am.
This guy is amazing.


1254
1:25:4,351 --> 1:25:6,604
You want me to handle it?
You want me to do it my way?


1255
1:25:6,604 --> 1:25:11,4
Cos I'll take care of him.
He ain't shit! Man.


1256
1:25:11,4 --> 1:25:15,446
O'Grady now, across the timeline.
He runs into a Hoyas double-team.


1257
1:25:15,446 --> 1:25:17,239
Pass over to Tyler. Not a good one.


1258
1:25:17,239 --> 1:25:29,46
Intercepted by Smith.
Smith on the break.


1259
1:25:29,46 --> 1:25:33,964
- Smith is down and he's injured.
- What you doing, man?


1260
1:25:33,964 --> 1:25:36,884
Coach Thompson
and the trainers are called in.


1261
1:25:36,884 --> 1:25:40,179
And, man, you hate to see this kind
of injury in a game of this magnitude.


1262
1:25:40,179 --> 1:25:42,306
- My shoulder.
- Jerrod, what's wrong?


1263
1:25:42,306 --> 1:25:44,642
- My shoulder.
- Just be careful. Take your time.


1264
1:25:44,642 --> 1:25:47,603
Stay there. Stay there.


1265
1:25:47,603 --> 1:25:52,274
And the heavily favored Hoyas
lose to UDub 78-65.


1266
1:25:52,274 --> 1:26:11,669
And now, the Huskies
move on to the big show.


1267
1:26:11,669 --> 1:26:18,884
- Kenny?
- Hey. What's up, RC? How you doing?


1268
1:26:18,884 --> 1:26:20,427
How is he?


1269
1:26:20,427 --> 1:26:23,639
I don't know. He's been
in surgery for over an hour.


1270
1:26:23,639 --> 1:26:30,604
I know he got a broken collarbone.
Concussion, too. Yeah.


1271
1:26:30,604 --> 1:26:35,25
I hope he's all right. God.


1272
1:26:35,25 --> 1:26:41,699
Kenny, it's your brother, isn't it?


1273
1:26:41,699 --> 1:26:44,159
- Yeah.
- So tell him to stop.


1274
1:26:44,159 --> 1:26:49,164
It's no use, RC. He ain't gonna
listen to me. He never listens to me.


1275
1:26:49,164 --> 1:26:51,792
He's the older brother.
He calls the shots.


1276
1:26:51,792 --> 1:26:57,464
Kenny, look at yourself. Antoine is dead
and he's still running your life.


1277
1:26:57,464 --> 1:27:1,177
You don't know what you're talking
about. First of all, you don't know us.


1278
1:27:1,177 --> 1:27:16,942
You just don't know what it's like trying
to live my life without my brother.


1279
1:27:16,942 --> 1:27:20,404
Stupidů


1280
1:27:20,404 --> 1:27:25,492
No, I don't know what it's like.


1281
1:27:25,492 --> 1:27:38,464
But neither will you until you let him go.


1282
1:27:38,464 --> 1:27:51,435
Antoine?


1283
1:27:51,435 --> 1:27:54,897
Yo, Antoine.


1284
1:27:54,897 --> 1:27:58,484
Antoine?


1285
1:27:58,484 --> 1:28:1,237
Antoine, I know you in here.


1286
1:28:1,237 --> 1:28:3,572
Yeah, I'm here.


1287
1:28:3,572 --> 1:28:6,33
You always did like being
first in the locker room.


1288
1:28:6,33 --> 1:28:9,62
Oh, that's only because
I was always so nervous, kid.


1289
1:28:9,62 --> 1:28:11,539
- Word?
- Yeah, man.


1290
1:28:11,539 --> 1:28:16,585
I'd come into the locker room,
see all these jerseys hanging,


1291
1:28:16,585 --> 1:28:20,13
and I'd find the one with my name on it.


1292
1:28:20,13 --> 1:28:26,53
And I would just sit down, stare at itů
wondering if I could go out there,


1293
1:28:26,53 --> 1:28:31,183
Lace 'em one more time
and live up to the hype.


1294
1:28:31,183 --> 1:28:35,104
Damn. I didn't know you were scared.


1295
1:28:35,104 --> 1:28:39,984
Baby brother, I played scared
every game of my life.


1296
1:28:39,984 --> 1:28:44,154
Wondering how I would do,
what people would think.


1297
1:28:44,154 --> 1:28:47,157
But I tell you something,
I'm not scared no more. No, sir.


1298
1:28:47,157 --> 1:28:50,661
This is one game I am going to enjoy.


1299
1:28:50,661 --> 1:28:53,747
Yeah, well, umů


1300
1:28:53,747 --> 1:28:58,502
You're gonna have to enjoy it
from the bench, Ant.


1301
1:28:58,502 --> 1:29:0,838
What are you saying?


1302
1:29:0,838 --> 1:29:4,49
Wait a minute, if this is about
Jerrod Smith, that was an accident.


1303
1:29:4,49 --> 1:29:6,802
You know me better than that.
I didn't mean to hurt him.


1304
1:29:6,802 --> 1:29:11,14
Antoine, look. You got us here.
No doubt about it, man.


1305
1:29:11,14 --> 1:29:13,434
Without you,
we'd be watching this on TV.


1306
1:29:13,434 --> 1:29:20,107
- Exactly.
- But, kid, this is cheating. It's wrong.


1307
1:29:20,107 --> 1:29:23,194
I'm sorry, Ant. You can't play, man.


1308
1:29:23,194 --> 1:29:28,365
- Oh, please. I'm playing, Kenny.
- You're gonna be playing alone.


1309
1:29:28,365 --> 1:29:32,286
Kenny, think about it.
NCAA title - one more game.


1310
1:29:32,286 --> 1:29:34,663
It's what we always dreamed about,
me and you.


1311
1:29:34,663 --> 1:29:39,46
Since we was kids, we've been partners.


1312
1:29:39,46 --> 1:29:43,547
Antoine, we ain't never
been partners, man.


1313
1:29:43,547 --> 1:29:47,468
I've been your sidekick
for over 20 years, kid.


1314
1:29:47,468 --> 1:29:53,265
And I was happy to be that, but I can't
do it no more, Ant. I just can't do it.


1315
1:29:53,265 --> 1:29:55,601
Now if you step on
that court tonight, it's over.


1316
1:29:55,601 --> 1:30:8,572
What are you gonna do?
How you gonna stop me? Huh?


1317
1:30:8,572 --> 1:30:22,253
We'll walk.


1318
1:30:22,253 --> 1:30:30,344
- We'll just forfeit.
- You will lose without me.


1319
1:30:30,344 --> 1:31:9,3
Then we'll just lose.


1320
1:31:9,3 --> 1:31:12,803
Welcome to the NCAA
National Championship.


1321
1:31:12,803 --> 1:31:16,223
Come on, get in here, guys. Get in.
Listen up now. Listen up. Come on.


1322
1:31:16,223 --> 1:31:21,103
You know, when I was a kid, I played in
the biggest basketball game of my life.


1323
1:31:21,103 --> 1:31:25,149
It was the Wilmington-Delaware
Youth League Championship.


1324
1:31:25,149 --> 1:31:30,237
And the winning prize
was a shiny gold medal.


1325
1:31:30,237 --> 1:31:34,241
Well, you know, we should've won
that game, but we didn't.


1326
1:31:34,241 --> 1:31:38,787
And I always felt that if I had
played just a little bit betterů


1327
1:31:38,787 --> 1:31:42,833
You know, if I had really played
my guts out, that we would've won.


1328
1:31:42,833 --> 1:31:46,212
And I would've won that medal.


1329
1:31:46,212 --> 1:31:50,966
Well, now this is theů This is the
biggest game of your lives.


1330
1:31:50,966 --> 1:31:56,472
And it's just you guys, two orange
hoops, 94 feet of hardwood.


1331
1:31:56,472 --> 1:32:0,518
So go out there and play
the very best that you can,


1332
1:32:0,518 --> 1:32:2,77
and really play your guts out.


1333
1:32:2,77 --> 1:32:7,233
And believe me, you will have no
regrets. And you will win your medal.


1334
1:32:7,233 --> 1:32:11,403
Just go out there and play the game
that you love. Come on!


1335
1:32:11,403 --> 1:32:16,534
Let's go! Let's go!


1336
1:32:16,534 --> 1:32:19,495
And the Huskies take the floor,
led by Kenny Tyler,


1337
1:32:19,495 --> 1:32:22,623
who's assumed leadership of this team
following the tragic loss


1338
1:32:22,623 --> 1:32:24,834
of his brother Antoine earlier this year.


1339
1:32:24,834 --> 1:32:27,169
The UMass Minutemen,
they're the favorites.


1340
1:32:27,169 --> 1:32:30,381
They come into the tournament
the number-one ranking


1341
1:32:30,381 --> 1:32:32,258
in all of college basketball.


1342
1:32:32,258 --> 1:32:36,95
Won't look for any upsets here.
Three future NBA stars on this club:


1343
1:32:36,95 --> 1:32:39,807
6'5" point guard, Rudy Olivera,
6'9" power forward, JJ Sampson,


1344
1:32:39,807 --> 1:32:41,934
and 6'10" forward, Mark Tucker.


1345
1:32:41,934 --> 1:32:45,396
I don't even think lady luck
can help the Huskies tonight.


1346
1:32:45,396 --> 1:32:47,731
Hrbacek and Sampson, the jump center.


1347
1:32:47,731 --> 1:32:50,901
And it's controlled by UMass,
over to Olivera.


1348
1:32:50,901 --> 1:32:54,71
You gotta push the ball, Olivera.
Push the ball.


1349
1:32:54,71 --> 1:32:57,658
- Sampson, down low.
- Zigi, Zigi, stay on him!


1350
1:32:57,658 --> 1:33:2,538
In the paint, a finger roll
and the early lead goes to UMass.


1351
1:33:2,538 --> 1:33:5,708
Go down! Give me two, give me two!


1352
1:33:5,708 --> 1:33:7,543
Tyler to O'Grady.


1353
1:33:7,543 --> 1:33:9,879
Hustle up, Danny.
Move that ball. Come on.


1354
1:33:9,879 --> 1:33:14,3
Dish back to Tyler. Tyler, with a look
and a shot that's way off the mark.


1355
1:33:14,3 --> 1:33:16,969
- Ooh.
- Goddamn.


1356
1:33:16,969 --> 1:33:20,55
Crosscourts it to Sampson,
out to Olivera.


1357
1:33:20,55 --> 1:33:21,765
Breakaway, easy deuce.


1358
1:33:21,765 --> 1:33:24,435
The Huskies are still having
trouble getting started.


1359
1:33:24,435 --> 1:33:29,607
We're midway through the half. UMass
leads 20 to eight. Back the other way.


1360
1:33:29,607 --> 1:33:33,485
The dish outside.
Moore, top of the key, he got it.


1361
1:33:33,485 --> 1:33:38,699
Nothing but the bottom of the net.
And the Huskies are down 14.


1362
1:33:38,699 --> 1:33:40,34
Get your hands off me!


1363
1:33:40,34 --> 1:33:44,788
Major has a look and sets,
and he'll take the three and he got it.


1364
1:33:44,788 --> 1:33:48,751
The Husky fans cheer their underdog
UDub squad for that three,


1365
1:33:48,751 --> 1:33:52,671
but it's hardly enough to send
the Minutemen packing.


1366
1:33:52,671 --> 1:33:55,716
Bounce pass down
to the baseline to Moore.


1367
1:33:55,716 --> 1:33:59,678
To Tucker. Tucker tosses it to Olivera.
Downcourt back-door lob.


1368
1:33:59,678 --> 1:34:3,307
And Sampson finishes that one off.


1369
1:34:3,307 --> 1:34:5,935
UMass just too strong tonight
for the Huskies,


1370
1:34:5,935 --> 1:34:13,15
as they pull to a 14-point advantage
with five minutes to go in the half.


1371
1:34:13,15 --> 1:34:16,32
Olivera proving his all-American
status in this half,


1372
1:34:16,32 --> 1:34:19,657
and he'll finish it withů a score!


1373
1:34:19,657 --> 1:34:25,871
Well, UMass leads 42 to 22 at half-time,
Billy, and I guess the $64,000 question


1374
1:34:25,871 --> 1:34:29,291
right now is, has that magic
that brought the Huskies


1375
1:34:29,291 --> 1:34:34,129
into the Final Four
finally abandoned them?


1376
1:34:34,129 --> 1:34:40,261
- Oh, man, it's over!
- We suck. We suck!


1377
1:34:40,261 --> 1:34:43,97
- We are pathetic.
- How many points we down, man?


1378
1:34:43,97 --> 1:34:54,817
- We down 20 points!
- It feels worse than that.


1379
1:34:54,817 --> 1:34:57,653
Let's be honest. We never
expected them to get this far.


1380
1:34:57,653 --> 1:35:1,115
It's amazing where they are. Too much
talent down the other end of the floor.


1381
1:35:1,115 --> 1:35:3,868
They're outclassed tonight.


1382
1:35:3,868 --> 1:35:10,416
Fellas, fellas, the hole's been dug, man.
They're just gonna bury us.


1383
1:35:10,416 --> 1:35:17,423
Guys, we just can't do it without Antoine.


1384
1:35:17,423 --> 1:35:19,758
We don't have to, Zigi.


1385
1:35:19,758 --> 1:35:23,429
Man, what are you saying, Kenny?


1386
1:35:23,429 --> 1:35:28,475
I'm saying I wanna win this. I didn't
come this far to go home empty-handed.


1387
1:35:28,475 --> 1:35:30,644
You don't know what
you're talking about.


1388
1:35:30,644 --> 1:35:36,66
Malik, we are down 20 points, man.
20 points! Do you know why?


1389
1:35:36,66 --> 1:35:38,235
I know why! Cos we suck.


1390
1:35:38,235 --> 1:35:41,447
See, that's bull. We don't suck!
They suck!


1391
1:35:41,447 --> 1:35:44,909
It's bullshit, man!
We're playing with no soul!


1392
1:35:44,909 --> 1:35:49,705
Cos we played that first half
without Antoine. Face it.


1393
1:35:49,705 --> 1:35:54,585
There's only one way
we gonna get back in this game.


1394
1:35:54,585 --> 1:35:55,92
What you saying?


1395
1:35:55,92 --> 1:35:59,507
I'm saying we go back out in that court,
Jimmy, and we take Antoine with us.


1396
1:35:59,507 --> 1:36:5,429
- No, no, no. We already agreedů
- Right here. Right here, Jimmy.


1397
1:36:5,429 --> 1:36:9,99
Right here.


1398
1:36:9,99 --> 1:36:14,563
Everything my brother wasů


1399
1:36:14,563 --> 1:36:23,113
Everything he gave usů is all right there.


1400
1:36:23,113 --> 1:36:29,828
Right here. Right here.


1401
1:36:29,828 --> 1:36:33,165
We gotta go out there and we gotta
shoot with him, we gotta run with him,


1402
1:36:33,165 --> 1:36:54,19
we gotta play with himů
We have to win with him, Malik.


1403
1:36:54,19 --> 1:36:57,731
Are you all with me?


1404
1:36:57,731 --> 1:36:59,942
- We're with you. Let's go.
- We're with you.


1405
1:36:59,942 --> 1:37:2,695
Let's do this. Let's go all the way now!


1406
1:37:2,695 --> 1:37:5,865
- We're with you, Kenny.
- Malik? Jimmy?


1407
1:37:5,865 --> 1:37:11,829
- Let's go. Let's do this!
- Let's go out there and win this game.


1408
1:37:11,829 --> 1:37:14,665
Let's go, baby!


1409
1:37:14,665 --> 1:37:17,251
The Huskies have hit the floor running.


1410
1:37:17,251 --> 1:37:22,89
Start of the second half, they're on
a 10-0 run. And they are fired up.


1411
1:37:22,89 --> 1:37:24,592
Kenny Tyler, top of the key, for three!


1412
1:37:24,592 --> 1:37:27,845
Kenny Tyler is lighting it up
on both ends of the court now.


1413
1:37:27,845 --> 1:37:31,39
O'Grady looks for someone.
Gets it to Tyler on the wing.


1414
1:37:31,39 --> 1:37:34,852
Tyler drives to the paint,
the 15-footer. It's good.


1415
1:37:34,852 --> 1:37:37,771
Kenny Tyler has electrified this crowd.
They're on their feet.


1416
1:37:37,771 --> 1:37:40,399
Holy smokes, Billy.
Kenny Tyler's on fire.


1417
1:37:40,399 --> 1:37:42,985
What an incredible performance
by this young man.


1418
1:37:42,985 --> 1:37:46,28
It really is, George. You love to see
big players come up in big games.


1419
1:37:46,28 --> 1:37:49,45
He's put this team on his back
and he's carrying them tonight.


1420
1:37:49,45 --> 1:37:54,955
Tyler fakes left, circles in,
drives, jumpshot up and it is goodů


1421
1:37:54,955 --> 1:37:58,25
- They're doing it, Mikulski.
- Danny! Hit Lik. Hit Lik.


1422
1:37:58,25 --> 1:38:1,295
O'Grady, the lob. Major with a slam!


1423
1:38:1,295 --> 1:38:5,966
And, ladies and gentlemen,
we have a ballgame.


1424
1:38:5,966 --> 1:38:8,761
- Set up. I'm coming back now.
- That's it. That's it!


1425
1:38:8,761 --> 1:38:11,472
In. In, baby, right here!


1426
1:38:11,472 --> 1:38:12,848
Go, Kenny! Go, Kenny!


1427
1:38:12,848 --> 1:38:15,643
Major to O'Grady.
O'Grady back to Tyler.


1428
1:38:15,643 --> 1:38:18,854
Fakes left, goes right,
fadeaway. He got it.


1429
1:38:18,854 --> 1:38:21,315
- And the Huskies pull to within 11.
- Right here!


1430
1:38:21,315 --> 1:38:24,193
O'Grady now, over to Hrbacek.
Way out on the wing.


1431
1:38:24,193 --> 1:38:28,989
Sky-hook for three, and Zigi hit it
from downtown for the triple.


1432
1:38:28,989 --> 1:38:31,242
That's it, you American scum, that's it!


1433
1:38:31,242 --> 1:38:34,78
Motion, baby. Motion.


1434
1:38:34,78 --> 1:38:36,747
Olivera makes the lay-in
to hold the lead at five.


1435
1:38:36,747 --> 1:38:39,208
Two minutes. Two minutes
and we down five, baby.


1436
1:38:39,208 --> 1:38:41,377
Kenny Tyler cuts it down to three.


1437
1:38:41,377 --> 1:38:46,799
Major into Tyler. Tyler fakes,
high archer off the glass.


1438
1:38:46,799 --> 1:38:52,304
He got it. And the double
brings the Huskies to within two.


1439
1:38:52,304 --> 1:38:54,39
And a time-out called by the Huskies.


1440
1:38:54,39 --> 1:38:57,101
The Minutemen clinging
to a two-point advantage


1441
1:38:57,101 --> 1:38:59,395
with just 16 seconds left on the clock.


1442
1:38:59,395 --> 1:39:1,939
OK, guys, 16 seconds left
to a National Championship.


1443
1:39:1,939 --> 1:39:3,566
We gotta keep Tyler from beating us.


1444
1:39:3,566 --> 1:39:5,901
And then we run the three
with Kenny, OK?


1445
1:39:5,901 --> 1:39:7,653
Kenny, you make the shot, all right?


1446
1:39:7,653 --> 1:39:11,73
Let's take this one home, fellas. This
is it. This is what we came here for.


1447
1:39:11,73 --> 1:39:15,995
- OK, come on. Dawgs up, you guys!
- Dawgs up! Dawgs up!


1448
1:39:15,995 --> 1:39:17,288
Come on, Zigi!


1449
1:39:17,288 --> 1:39:18,581
UMass!


1450
1:39:18,581 --> 1:39:22,84
And who would've thought the Huskies
would even be in this position.


1451
1:39:22,84 --> 1:39:24,295
16 seconds on the clock.


1452
1:39:24,295 --> 1:39:28,299
A chance at being a giant killer
of the number-one team in the country.


1453
1:39:28,299 --> 1:39:32,11
The Huskies are lining up. The
Minutemen'll use man-to-man defense.


1454
1:39:32,11 --> 1:39:36,182
We have to assume Pederson's made
the call to Tyler for the game winner.


1455
1:39:36,182 --> 1:39:39,894
Moore is all over LaSalle.
He doesn't want a five-second call here.


1456
1:39:39,894 --> 1:39:44,23
Finally, the in-bound is stolen by Tucker.
And that is it.


1457
1:39:44,23 --> 1:39:46,525
If they can hold on to it,
the championship is theirs.


1458
1:39:46,525 --> 1:39:50,279
Nine seconds to go. All UMass
has to do is to occupy this ball.


1459
1:39:50,279 --> 1:39:54,7
The Huskies step up the D,
but time is running out.


1460
1:39:54,7 --> 1:39:58,996
Somebody's gotta force a turnover
or a foul here or this one's in the books.


1461
1:39:58,996 --> 1:40:2,291
O'Grady on Tucker. We're down
to seven seconds and counting.


1462
1:40:2,291 --> 1:40:6,86
O'Grady on him like a pit bull,
trying to make something happen.


1463
1:40:6,86 --> 1:40:10,7
Five seconds left.
Someone needs a play here.


1464
1:40:10,7 --> 1:40:11,425
No turnovers. Don't turn!


1465
1:40:11,425 --> 1:40:14,428
Tucker trying to pass to Olivera
and Tyler gets a hand on it.


1466
1:40:14,428 --> 1:40:18,265
- Here comes Tyler again.
- Go! Go!


1467
1:40:18,265 --> 1:40:23,479
Come on!


1468
1:40:23,479 --> 1:40:33,3
Tyler again, he's got it. He goes up.


1469
1:40:33,3 --> 1:40:36,492
I got it, Kenny!


1470
1:40:36,492 --> 1:40:40,579
Ant, no!


1471
1:40:40,579 --> 1:40:56,679
Let it go.


1472
1:40:56,679 --> 1:40:58,931
It's good!


1473
1:40:58,931 --> 1:41:6,647
Yeah!


1474
1:41:6,647 --> 1:41:24,54
Oh, my God!


1475
1:41:24,54 --> 1:41:30,254
Yeah! All the way!
Number one! All the way!


1476
1:41:30,254 --> 1:41:38,345
- We did it, baby!
- No, you did it.


1477
1:41:38,345 --> 1:41:40,681
I gotta go see the coach.
I'll be right back, OK?


1478
1:41:40,681 --> 1:41:42,892
OK.


1479
1:41:42,892 --> 1:41:50,399
- Hey, RC!
- Hey!


1480
1:41:50,399 --> 1:41:54,236
Antoine. Wait!


1481
1:41:54,236 --> 1:41:56,572
Antoine!


1482
1:41:56,572 --> 1:42:0,951
Antoine!


1483
1:42:0,951 --> 1:42:4,371
Antoine, wait! Ant!


1484
1:42:4,371 --> 1:42:9,919
Antoineů


1485
1:42:9,919 --> 1:42:11,337
We did it, baby.


1486
1:42:11,337 --> 1:42:17,92
No, you did it,
like I never let you do it before.


1487
1:42:17,92 --> 1:42:19,72
And you looked good doing it, too.


1488
1:42:19,72 --> 1:42:22,973
I had a good teacher.


1489
1:42:22,973 --> 1:42:27,436
Yeah.


1490
1:42:27,436 --> 1:42:31,482
They're calling me.
They want me to play on the team.


1491
1:42:31,482 --> 1:42:41,75
They said I might make the starting five
if I learn not to hog the ball.


1492
1:42:41,75 --> 1:42:44,37
- I love you. Come here, man.
- I love you.


1493
1:42:44,37 --> 1:42:47,873
It's OK. I love you.


1494
1:42:47,873 --> 1:42:49,708
Bye, Antoine.


1495
1:42:49,708 --> 1:42:55,422
No, no, no. No goodbyes.
Cos I'll always be with you.


1496
1:42:55,422 --> 1:42:59,844
Hey, it's like Pop says.


1497
1:42:59,844 --> 1:43:6,183
If you and I stick togetherů


1498
1:43:6,183 --> 1:43:9,603
..anything can happen.


1499
1:43:9,603 --> 1:43:14,66
You gonna be all right, man.


1500
1:43:14,66 --> 1:43:29,707
But if you don't repeat next year,
I'll be back.


1501
1:43:29,707 --> 1:43:35,838
Here I come.


1502
1:43:35,838 --> 1:43:38,757
Yeah!


1503
1:43:38,757 --> 1:43:40,301
All right. All right!


1504
1:43:40,301 --> 1:43:45,723
Yeah, baby! Huskies!
Number one, baby!


1505
1:43:45,723 --> 1:43:48,475
Yeah, Coach! Number one, baby!


1506
1:43:48,475 --> 1:43:53,105
Huskies! Whoo! Huskies, baby!


1507
1:43:53,105 --> 1:43:56,25
Huskies!


1508
1:43:56,25 --> 1:44:8,954
Whoo! Yeah, baby!


1509
1:44:8,954 --> 1:44:16,86
- That's our sixth man, isn't it?
- Yeah, Coach.


1510
1:44:16,86 --> 1:44:21,3
A and Ků all the way, baby.


1511
1:44:21,3 --> 1:44:27,765
Yeah! Yeah!


1512
1:44:27,765 --> 1:44:30,476
Yeah, baby!


1513
1:44:30,476 --> 1:46:30,476
You the man, Coach!
