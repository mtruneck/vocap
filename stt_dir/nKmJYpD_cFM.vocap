###0 JACOB SOBOROFF: Hey, Jacob here.
###0 Today, we've got a guy turning China
###2 into the world's biggest dance floor--
###5 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###8 JACOB SOBOROFF: --a DIY robot soaring over the Serengeti,
###12 and the psychedelic return of an internet legend.
###15 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###18 JACOB SOBOROFF: This is YouTube Nation.
###20 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###23 JACOB SOBOROFF: Competitive gaming is huge.
###25 Over 30 million people watched the League of Legends
###27 season three championship-- 30 million.
###29 Season four starts today.
###31 But old school gaming, it is alive and well, too.
###33 Motherboard from VICE made this short doc
###34 about one of the greatest rivalries in gaming history,
###37 ironically, between a plastic surgeon and a bodybuilder.
###41 VINCENT: Now, I don't want to see Hank win again.
###43 But I think that if I win, people will never
###46 be mad to see me win, because, I mean, come on, look at me.
###49 HANK: I don't feel like Vincent is nipping at my heels.
###52 I'm not too worried about him.
###53 No matter what score he puts up, I could probably top it.
###56 JACOB SOBOROFF: Competitive "Donkey Kong"
###58 went mainstream in 2007 with the cult hit "King of Kong."
###60 And this picks up where that left off.
###62 HANK: My mind is just cluttered with barrels.
###64 
###67 VINCENT: Who's going to win, the muscle or the brain?
###69 And of course, the muscle will win.
###71 JACOB SOBOROFF: Watch to see these titans clash
###73 and find out who wins.
###75 BEN: I've seen a million skate videos,
###77 but I've never seen anything like this.
###78 I shared it as soon as I saw it.
###79 They call this foot twerking in the description,
###81 but it's pretty much just doing unbelievable tricks
###84 on long boards that are so heavy,
###85 they're usually only used for cruising.
###87 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###95 The music, the locations, the skating-- pretty much
###97 everything about this captures the LA vibe
###99 I want everyone to see.
###100 JACOB SOBOROFF: Last weekend, the Dallas Safari Club
###103 auctioned off a permit to hunt the endangered African black
###106 rhino.
###106 Really?
###107 Thankfully, this next video is the opposite of that.
###109 A British wildlife photographer built this tiny helicopter
###112 that's flying the camera.
###113 He controls it remotely while he's watching a live feed.
###115 He's got a range of over half a mile.
###117 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###128 JACOB SOBOROFF: It kind of feels like "The Lion
###130 King" in real life.
###131 You've got to love a guy who says
###132 his goal is to inspire people to celebrate and conserve
###134 the natural wonders of our planet.
###137 CARLY: You know that inner scream
###138 that you get when someone tries to show you
###140 952 photos from a trip they just took?
###143 Well, this guy is completely changing the game.
###145 To remember his 100-day study abroad program in China
###148 last fall, Dartmouth sophomore Jake Gaba
###150 filmed himself dancing in over 60
###152 locations across the country.
###153 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###165 CARLY: Love the moves, love but shorts.
###167 Jake, you have officially inspired
###169 me to start saving for my own adventure.
###171 JACOB SOBOROFF: The friend zone-- you've been there.
###173 I've been there-- not a fan.
###175 The most recent video from sketch comedy gurus Extremely
###177 Decent speaks to all the dudes trapped in limbo.
###179 [MUSIC - UNSUNG HEROES, "NICE GUYS"]
###181 
###199 JACOB SOBOROFF: They've only been around for one year,
###201 but I went to their channel to watch one video,
###203 and it is easy to get sucked in for an hour.
###205 This poke at Facebook racked up four million views.
###208 MALE SPEAKER: Now it's way easier for your friends
###210 to keep you in the know.
###212 FEMALE SPEAKER: Nick, hi.
###213 Can you come to my birthday party?
###216 Nick, would you vote for my brother in his contest?
###219 Nick, will you come to my improv show tonight?
###222 NICK: No, I'm not going to any of those.
###224 JACOB SOBOROFF: "Nice Guys" is just the first
###226 in a series of Unsung Hero videos.
###228 You've got a suggestion for the next one, go over there.
###230 Give them a comment.
###230 I vote for my wife, because you have no idea.
###234 There is absolutely no way we can watch every video,
###237 so we rely on you guys to send us
###238 the stuff that you find or create.
###240 ALEX: Hi, I'm Alex, and I'm a curator on the show.
###241 And I come across all kinds of videos
###243 while looking for stuff to feature.
###244 But this part of the show will be
###245 where you can have a chance to tell us
###246 about your finds-- maybe something
###248 crazy, like this video, from the guy who did Nyan Cat.
###250 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###263 JACOB SOBOROFF: Thank you, Alex.
###264 The original Nyan Cat video has over 100 million views.
###267 You want your face right here, make a video like Alex did,
