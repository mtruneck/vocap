0:0:12,6 --> 0:0:14,42
ALEX MILLER: This is me
asleep on a plane,


3
0:0:14,42 --> 0:0:16,7
dreaming of being a killer.


4
0:0:16,7 --> 0:0:19,0
I'm heading to Ardnamurchan,
the most westerly point of


5
0:0:19,0 --> 0:0:20,14
mainland Britain.


6
0:0:20,14 --> 0:0:21,86
A place filled with
little more than


7
0:0:21,86 --> 0:0:24,911
seagulls, sheep, and deer.


8
0:0:24,911 --> 0:0:27,5
I've booked a week in the
hunting lodge of Ardnamurchan


9
0:0:27,5 --> 0:0:30,67
Estate, a huge expanse of
mountainous land where deer


10
0:0:30,67 --> 0:0:32,409
stalking is still
a way of life.


11
0:0:32,409 --> 0:0:35,1
Here, for a little more than
200 quid you can stalk and


12
0:0:35,1 --> 0:0:37,8
butcher your own
Highland deer.


13
0:0:37,8 --> 0:0:40,47
I'm a lifelong supermarket
carnivore, but soft as I am, I


14
0:0:40,47 --> 0:0:44,89
wanted to see, taste, and feel
the death behind my dinner.


15
0:0:44,89 --> 0:0:45,69
It was a long trip.


16
0:0:45,69 --> 0:0:47,86
And the roads were dark
and confusing.


17
0:0:47,86 --> 0:0:49,93
We were going to one of the
most isolated places in


18
0:0:49,93 --> 0:0:52,23
Britain with no idea what
was waiting for us.


19
0:0:52,23 --> 0:0:54,56
Would there be a blue-faced
"Deliverance" tribe dressing


20
0:0:54,56 --> 0:0:55,64
in the skin of outsiders?


21
0:0:55,64 --> 0:0:58,12
Or just a small group of old
women huddling around a pillow


22
0:0:58,12 --> 0:1:0,7
box and discussing heather?


23
0:1:0,7 --> 0:1:1,91
I'm a little bit worried that
I'm not going to fit.


24
0:1:1,91 --> 0:1:9,6
[MUSIC PLAYING]


25
0:1:9,6 --> 0:1:11,96
ALEX MILLER: Deer stalking is
the most traditional form of


26
0:1:11,96 --> 0:1:14,4
hunting in the world, as the
practice has remained


27
0:1:14,4 --> 0:1:16,34
practically unchanged since
the English aristocracy


28
0:1:16,34 --> 0:1:19,8
introduced it in the 1850s.


29
0:1:19,8 --> 0:1:22,35
It might seem quite primeval,
but stalking a deer looks


30
0:1:22,35 --> 0:1:24,73
practically vegetarian compared
to more common types


31
0:1:24,73 --> 0:1:25,97
of food production.


32
0:1:25,97 --> 0:1:28,68
We've all heard that intensive
farming is melting the planet.


33
0:1:28,68 --> 0:1:30,79
The battery chickens are
terribly depressed and ill


34
0:1:30,79 --> 0:1:34,76
educated and that every child
born since 1987 thinks meat is


35
0:1:34,76 --> 0:1:37,9
grown in freezer aisles.


36
0:1:37,9 --> 0:1:38,44
But it's not all like that.


37
0:1:38,44 --> 0:1:39,77
In the highlands of
Scotland, the


38
0:1:39,77 --> 0:1:43,71
hunter-gatherer is still king.


39
0:1:43,71 --> 0:1:47,32
So it's there that I'm going to
live, kill, and feast with


40
0:1:47,32 --> 0:1:49,715
the last remaining indigenous
tribe in Britain.


41
0:1:49,715 --> 0:1:54,38



42
0:1:54,38 --> 0:1:57,35
Is that the kind of
thing we trek on?


43
0:1:57,35 --> 0:2:0,69
The knife coming up
from the ground?


44
0:2:0,69 --> 0:2:1,868
It's completely sheer.


45
0:2:1,868 --> 0:2:4,82
Look at that.


46
0:2:4,82 --> 0:2:6,75
Surely deer can't
live in that?


47
0:2:6,75 --> 0:2:8,88
I can't live in that.


48
0:2:8,88 --> 0:2:11,19
There's no way I'm going to be
able to survive if you put me


49
0:2:11,19 --> 0:2:12,65
there for five minutes.


50
0:2:12,65 --> 0:2:14,54
We're going to go and stalk
some deer in the


51
0:2:14,54 --> 0:2:16,641
next couple of days.


52
0:2:16,641 --> 0:2:17,8
Do that.


53
0:2:17,8 --> 0:2:20,216
Do you not fancy my chances?


54
0:2:20,216 --> 0:2:22,9
-If you never shot a rifle
before, no chance.


55
0:2:22,9 --> 0:2:24,24
ALEX MILLER: What
you on about?


56
0:2:24,24 --> 0:2:26,6
He's telling us that we haven't
got a chance of


57
0:2:26,6 --> 0:2:27,33
getting a deer.


58
0:2:27,33 --> 0:2:28,1
-In Ardnamurchan?


59
0:2:28,1 --> 0:2:28,42
ALEX MILLER: We're going
to go stalking.


60
0:2:28,42 --> 0:2:29,55
-No chance.


61
0:2:29,55 --> 0:2:30,29
In Ardnamurchan?


62
0:2:30,29 --> 0:2:30,98
ALEX MILLER: Yeah.


63
0:2:30,98 --> 0:2:31,955
-Oh, you'll get a deer.


64
0:2:31,955 --> 0:2:32,56
ALEX MILLER: Yeah.


65
0:2:32,56 --> 0:2:34,746
-Ah, but it depends if he's
a good shot or not.


66
0:2:34,746 --> 0:2:36,326
ALEX MILLER: Do you think
I look like a good shot?


67
0:2:36,326 --> 0:2:36,638
-No.


68
0:2:36,638 --> 0:2:36,794
-No.


69
0:2:36,794 --> 0:2:39,134
ALEX MILLER: I mean I'm not--


70
0:2:39,134 --> 0:2:41,95
After traveling for 15 hours,
losing ourselves in the


71
0:2:41,95 --> 0:2:45,45
thundering roads, we arrived.


72
0:2:45,45 --> 0:2:47,25
We were greeted with nothing
but darkness.


73
0:2:47,25 --> 0:2:53,98



74
0:2:53,98 --> 0:2:55,98
Wow.


75
0:2:55,98 --> 0:3:0,71
This has got murder written
all over it.

77
0:3:7,867 --> 0:3:10,79
ALEX MILLER: When the morning
came the darkness had gone,


78
0:3:10,79 --> 0:3:13,29
exposing this incredible
landscape and the hunting


79
0:3:13,29 --> 0:3:15,8
lodge we were staying in.


80
0:3:15,8 --> 0:3:17,32
For a mere lodge, it looked an
awful lot like a castle.


81
0:3:17,32 --> 0:3:20,9



82
0:3:20,9 --> 0:3:22,27
Donald Houston, the owner
of the estate, came


83
0:3:22,27 --> 0:3:23,396
to welcome us in.


84
0:3:23,396 --> 0:3:26,38
DONALD HOUSTON: The reality
of living up here in the


85
0:3:26,38 --> 0:3:29,71
isolation is something that most
people can't cope with.


86
0:3:29,71 --> 0:3:31,3
The nearest supermarket
is two hours away.


87
0:3:31,3 --> 0:3:33,1
The nearest cinema's
two hours away,


88
0:3:33,1 --> 0:3:34,36
there's absolutely nothing.


89
0:3:34,36 --> 0:3:36,8
ALEX MILLER: Do you find that
all the people that come have


90
0:3:36,8 --> 0:3:40,276
the kind of right sense
of respect for the--


91
0:3:40,276 --> 0:3:41,49
DONALD HOUSTON: Some
do, some don't.


92
0:3:41,49 --> 0:3:44,37
There are a number of people
and, I suppose, an increasing


93
0:3:44,37 --> 0:3:48,52
number of people who get a list
of all the animals they


94
0:3:48,52 --> 0:3:50,9
want to shoot worldwide, and
then it's just ticking a box.


95
0:3:50,9 --> 0:3:53,44
So on occasion we have had
people that fly in in the


96
0:3:53,44 --> 0:3:55,47
morning, shoot an animal, fly
back out in the afternoon.


97
0:3:55,47 --> 0:3:56,95
ALEX MILLER: Do you find that
kind of approach a bit


98
0:3:56,95 --> 0:3:58,1
distasteful?


99
0:3:58,1 --> 0:3:59,866
DONALD HOUSTON: Yeah, yes.

102
0:4:6,44 --> 0:4:9,33
And while street crime may be
growing sport down south, I've


103
0:4:9,33 --> 0:4:11,25
never actually held
a gun before.

To train us up as marksman,
Alistair McLoughlin--

otherwise known as Titch-- the
local fisherman and sometimes


106
0:4:16,79 --> 0:4:17,89
poacher took us into an extinct


107
0:4:17,89 --> 0:4:19,76
volcano hunting for woodcock.


108
0:4:19,76 --> 0:4:22,18
This would be the first baby
step on my journey towards


109
0:4:22,18 --> 0:4:23,844
becoming a hunter.

shotgun here's a 12 bolt.

Be careful, don't put any bigger
shells in it or you


115

could end up with an explosion
on your hands.

shotguns, we started

are going to be to on either
side in a minute.

go around the corner.

out of the river and the sky

about doing this for about
the last three weeks.

slaughters beautiful creatures
for a documentary.

Last night I had some pretty
unsubtle dreams.

I was lying in a bed and someone
had cut a square into


197
0:7:56,19 --> 0:8:0,77
my stomach and ripped organs
out of me, which are two


198
0:8:0,77 --> 0:8:3,1
things that I pretty much have
to do to this deer today.

head stalker, Niall Rowntree.

Don't know that much
about him.

0:8:7,871 --> 0:8:11,52
But we know that every day he
gets up early in the morning,


202
0:8:11,52 --> 0:8:14,388
loads his rifle, and goes
and kills deer.

0:8:14,388 --> 0:8:17,196
So he should probably be able
to deliver what we want.


204
0:8:17,196 --> 0:8:20,472



205
0:8:20,472 --> 0:8:24,15
Yeah, you can tell a man's
serious about death when he


206
0:8:24,15 --> 0:8:28,88
keeps the carcasses
up on the wall.


207
0:8:28,88 --> 0:8:31,26
We don't get to shoot a stag
because it's the wrong time of


208
0:8:31,26 --> 0:8:31,82
the season.


209
0:8:31,82 --> 0:8:33,26
We're going to shoot a woman.


210
0:8:33,26 --> 0:8:36,317
Which is, for some
reason, darker.


211
0:8:36,317 --> 0:8:38,245
NIALL ROWENTREE: And what you
want to do today when we're


212
0:8:38,245 --> 0:8:41,82
out is any instructions you get,
for your own safety in


213
0:8:41,82 --> 0:8:44,105
particular, follow
them in detail.


214
0:8:44,105 --> 0:8:46,26
And if we're approaching
deer you want to be in


215
0:8:46,26 --> 0:8:48,57
single file behind me.


216
0:8:48,57 --> 0:8:50,98
Avoid fast movements.


217
0:8:50,98 --> 0:8:52,87
Avoid the classic thing
everybody does, and you can


218
0:8:52,87 --> 0:8:53,41
watch this.


219
0:8:53,41 --> 0:8:56,28
Is when you're out stalking up
on deer, very often people


220
0:8:56,28 --> 0:8:58,7
will do that to see what
you're looking at.


221
0:8:58,7 --> 0:9:1,56
And because they're programmed
on movement, If you stick your


222
0:9:1,56 --> 0:9:3,93
head around the corner of a hill
or a skyline they'll see


223
0:9:3,93 --> 0:9:7,17
it quite easily and
they'll take off.


224
0:9:7,17 --> 0:9:9,33
Their sense of preservation
is better than ours.


225
0:9:9,33 --> 0:9:12,3
ALEX MILLER: How close
are we able to get?


226
0:9:12,3 --> 0:9:14,38
NIALL ROWENTREE: We'll ideally
aim to be about 100 metres.


227
0:9:14,38 --> 0:9:15,2
ALEX MILLER: OK.


228
0:9:15,2 --> 0:9:17,48
If you do get a good shot in how
long does it take before


229
0:9:17,48 --> 0:9:17,3
the animal dies?


230
0:9:17,3 --> 0:9:19,39
NIALL ROWENTREE: If you hit it
properly with your instructor


231
0:9:19,39 --> 0:9:21,35
to shoot it today the animal
will die instantly.


232
0:9:21,35 --> 0:9:23,13
It'll collapse in
front of you.


233
0:9:23,13 --> 0:9:23,615
And that'll be it.


234
0:9:23,615 --> 0:9:26,43
ALEX MILLER: Before I was
allowed to take a life I had


235
0:9:26,43 --> 0:9:27,51
to pass a shooting test.


236
0:9:27,51 --> 0:9:30,44
If I missed the target more
than once in four shots I


237
0:9:30,44 --> 0:9:32,36
wouldn't be allowed to do it.


238
0:9:32,36 --> 0:9:34,68
This was to make sure I wouldn't
mess it up, blow an


239
0:9:34,68 --> 0:9:36,39
eye out, and leave a
disabled deer to


240
0:9:36,39 --> 0:9:38,38
slowly down on the mountain.


241
0:9:38,38 --> 0:9:40,55
Slowly, methodically, Niall
took me through


242
0:9:40,55 --> 0:9:42,92
the shooting process.


243
0:9:42,92 --> 0:9:44,775
Three times out of four
I nailed the target.


244
0:9:44,775 --> 0:9:48,494



245
0:9:48,494 --> 0:9:50,336
And so I was clear to hunt.


246
0:9:50,336 --> 0:9:51,906
NIALL ROWENTREE: That's smack
in the middle of the


247
0:9:51,906 --> 0:9:52,71
red plate this time.


248
0:9:52,71 --> 0:9:54,8
ALEX MILLER: Sweet.


249
0:9:54,8 --> 0:9:58,14
On the way to the store we
paused to feed some stag.


250
0:9:58,14 --> 0:10:0,3
I guess that was some cruel
perch on Niall's behalf.


251
0:10:0,3 --> 0:10:3,7
Because once hundreds of these
amazing animals have lept over


252
0:10:3,7 --> 0:10:5,69
the landscape to be fed by
you, you realize what a


253
0:10:5,69 --> 0:10:7,28
beautiful thing you're
killing.


254
0:10:7,28 --> 0:10:9,23
NIALL ROWENTREE: They've been
my whole life all my life.


255
0:10:9,23 --> 0:10:12,232
I mean I can remember going to
see deer since I was a tiny


256
0:10:12,232 --> 0:10:13,56
little boy.


257
0:10:13,56 --> 0:10:15,58
And I've been fascinated with
them since day one.


258
0:10:15,58 --> 0:10:20,21
For what we sell as a product
to foreign visitors we would


259
0:10:20,21 --> 0:10:23,56
probably cull that old stag
this coming year.


260
0:10:23,56 --> 0:10:25,25
That stag-- to give you an
idea-- is worth about a


261
0:10:25,25 --> 0:10:26,75
thousand pounds to
us to a client.


262
0:10:26,75 --> 0:10:28,37
But he's cheekier than
he ought to be.


263
0:10:28,37 --> 0:10:30,68
You see the head tilting
down at you there?


264
0:10:30,68 --> 0:10:32,94
But if you stare at him too
much he bottles it.


265
0:10:32,94 --> 0:10:35,768
They don't like being
stared at.


266
0:10:35,768 --> 0:10:37,54
ALEX MILLER: Do they ever
attack humans ever?


267
0:10:37,54 --> 0:10:41,42
NIALL ROWENTREE: My father was
very badly mauled by one when


268
0:10:41,42 --> 0:10:44,35
I was a kid, but it
was a park stag.


269
0:10:44,35 --> 0:10:46,57
If they lose their fear of man
they become dangerous.


270
0:10:46,57 --> 0:10:48,4
He was quite badly lacerated
with him.


271
0:10:48,4 --> 0:10:49,97
He was struck in the head
and then two or three


272
0:10:49,97 --> 0:10:52,896
times in the body.


273
0:10:52,896 --> 0:10:54,91
Yeah, I think if I hadn't shot
the stag when it was attacking


274
0:10:54,91 --> 0:10:56,5
him it might've killed him.


275
0:10:56,5 --> 0:10:57,452
ALEX MILLER: You shot the stag
when it was attacking him?


276
0:10:57,452 --> 0:10:58,47
NIALL ROWENTREE: Yeah.


277
0:10:58,47 --> 0:10:59,94
ALEX MILLER: You saved
your dad's life?


278
0:10:59,94 --> 0:11:1,125
NIALL ROWENTREE: Yes.


279
0:11:1,125 --> 0:11:3,5
ALEX MILLER: That's a pretty
cool thing to be able to do


280
0:11:3,5 --> 0:11:4,5
when you're 13.


281
0:11:4,5 --> 0:11:4,72
NIALL ROWENTREE: You
do your best.


282
0:11:4,72 --> 0:11:5,87
ALEX MILLER: A good one
to have over your


283
0:11:5,87 --> 0:11:7,61
old man, isn't it?


284
0:11:7,61 --> 0:11:11,66
So we've actually just been this
close to deer, beautiful,


285
0:11:11,66 --> 0:11:14,18
beautiful stags.


286
0:11:14,18 --> 0:11:16,67
Which is a lovely experience,
only we're on our way to kill


287
0:11:16,67 --> 0:11:17,42
their girlfriends.


288
0:11:17,42 --> 0:11:19,94
With any luck, one of the female
deers will attack us


289
0:11:19,94 --> 0:11:23,1
and I'll have to shoot her
out of an act of charity.


290
0:11:23,1 --> 0:11:25,55
Deer stalking is centuries
old, one of the most


291
0:11:25,55 --> 0:11:27,96
traditional forms of hunting
in the world.


292
0:11:27,96 --> 0:11:29,94
And the vast majority
of venison is still


293
0:11:29,94 --> 0:11:31,84
produced this way.


294
0:11:31,84 --> 0:11:33,9
The deer are culled in order to
promote the health of the


295
0:11:33,9 --> 0:11:36,22
land and the ecosystem.


296
0:11:36,22 --> 0:11:38,64
The stalker's prey is
chosen specifically.


297
0:11:38,64 --> 0:11:41,17
Once it's been shot, the carcass
is butchered locally


298
0:11:41,17 --> 0:11:43,8
and exported as organic
free-range meat.


299
0:11:43,8 --> 0:11:46,77
The process is a large part of
a local economy short of many


300
0:11:46,77 --> 0:11:47,84
other options.


301
0:11:47,84 --> 0:11:50,59
Tourists like me-- we were
continually assured--


302
0:11:50,59 --> 0:11:52,23
only help to keep this
part of the world


303
0:11:52,23 --> 0:11:53,59
from becoming a desert.


304
0:11:53,59 --> 0:11:56,325
So remember, getting these
pretty things is dead ethical.


305
0:11:56,325 --> 0:11:58,22
NIALL ROWENTREE: We'll try and
whisper to one another.


306
0:11:58,22 --> 0:12:0,6
But once we get really close we
might not be able to speak.


307
0:12:0,6 --> 0:12:1,995
It might just be hand signals.


308
0:12:1,995 --> 0:12:3,32
So if you're happy--


309
0:12:3,32 --> 0:12:4,795
quite simple-- thumbs up.


310
0:12:4,795 --> 0:12:8,87
You're not so happy, nod your
head, shake your head.


311
0:12:8,87 --> 0:12:10,19
Exactly like that.


312
0:12:10,19 --> 0:12:11,7
If you burst into tears
I'll know you're not


313
0:12:11,7 --> 0:12:13,42
feeling up for it.


314
0:12:13,42 --> 0:12:14,994
-Where's the nearest hospital?


315
0:12:14,994 --> 0:12:15,822
NIALL ROWENTREE: Fort William.


316
0:12:15,822 --> 0:12:16,65
-How far away is that?


317
0:12:16,65 --> 0:12:17,84
NIALL ROWENTREE: That's
about 70 miles away.


318
0:12:17,84 --> 0:12:19,214
ALEX MILLER: Good, good.


319
0:12:19,214 --> 0:12:22,42



320
0:12:22,42 --> 0:12:28,395
Is this kind of the normal
steepness that we'll be


321
0:12:28,395 --> 0:12:29,1
dealing with?


322
0:12:29,1 --> 0:12:29,83
NIALL ROWENTREE: Yes.


323
0:12:29,83 --> 0:12:32,724
This is going from sea level
to nearly 1800 feet.


324
0:12:32,724 --> 0:12:34,62
How heavy is this thing?


325
0:12:34,62 --> 0:12:37,83
The biggest stag we shot here
last season in 2008


326
0:12:37,83 --> 0:12:39,79
was 24 stone 1.


327
0:12:39,79 --> 0:12:42,33
ALEX MILLER: So I mean, when you
were dragging them back do


328
0:12:42,33 --> 0:12:43,45
we let gravity do most
of the work?


329
0:12:43,45 --> 0:12:44,66
NIALL ROWENTREE: No.


330
0:12:44,66 --> 0:12:44,938
ALEX MILLER: No?


331
0:12:44,938 --> 0:12:46,44
You let us do the work?


332
0:12:46,44 --> 0:12:46,78
NIALL ROWENTREE: Yeah,
you'll do the work.


333
0:12:46,78 --> 0:12:48,882
ALEX MILLER: Oh good.


334
0:12:48,882 --> 0:12:53,698
We haven't gone that far, still
really quite exhausting.


335
0:12:53,698 --> 0:12:54,705
NIALL ROWENTREE: How
old are you?


336
0:12:54,705 --> 0:12:55,71
ALEX MILLER: I'm 25.


337
0:12:55,71 --> 0:12:56,79
NIALL ROWENTREE: Embarrassing.


338
0:12:56,79 --> 0:12:57,93
ALEX MILLER: How old are you?


339
0:12:57,93 --> 0:13:1,802
NIALL ROWENTREE: 44.


340
0:13:1,802 --> 0:13:3,786
ALEX MILLER: We've just
climbed up some of the


341
0:13:3,786 --> 0:13:7,145
steepest stuff I've ever walked
up for about an hour.


342
0:13:7,145 --> 0:13:8,28
It's pretty tiring.


343
0:13:8,28 --> 0:13:10,696
The view's absolutely
incredible.


344
0:13:10,696 --> 0:13:14,6
But Niall's just told us that
he's spotted the deer just


345
0:13:14,6 --> 0:13:16,34
over the ridge there.


346
0:13:16,34 --> 0:13:18,49
As he puts it, the game is on.


347
0:13:18,49 --> 0:13:20,91
Which means it's going to be
quite quiet and single file


348
0:13:20,91 --> 0:13:21,395
from now on.


349
0:13:21,395 --> 0:13:34,78
[MUSIC PLAYING]


350
0:13:34,78 --> 0:13:36,695
NIALL ROWENTREE: The idea
is to disturb them


351
0:13:36,695 --> 0:13:38,82
as little as possible.


352
0:13:38,82 --> 0:13:42,48
So once you've shot,
you don't move.


353
0:13:42,48 --> 0:13:44,605
And if everything goes according
to plan, the animal


354
0:13:44,605 --> 0:13:47,4
will drop where it's shot, and
the others will look around to


355
0:13:47,4 --> 0:13:49,37
try and figure out what's
happened, and then quietly


356
0:13:49,37 --> 0:13:51,926
drift away.


357
0:13:51,926 --> 0:13:58,674
The main group is only
80 meters away.


358
0:13:58,674 --> 0:14:2,64
ALEX MILLER: Suddenly, Niall
dropped to his knees.


359
0:14:2,64 --> 0:14:4,83
We all followed him, and crawled
through icy mud for


360
0:14:4,83 --> 0:14:6,82
about 30 meters, until
we reached a


361
0:14:6,82 --> 0:14:9,32
mound, my grassy knoll.


362
0:14:9,32 --> 0:14:12,61

0:14:12,61 --> 0:14:15,35
We stayed frozen for at least
30 minutes while Niall chose


364
0:14:15,35 --> 0:14:16,6
our victim.


365
0:14:16,6 --> 0:14:18,39



366
0:14:18,39 --> 0:14:20,52
Eventually he beckoned.


367
0:14:20,52 --> 0:14:23,63
I crawled alongside him and he
pointed out which deer I was


368
0:14:23,63 --> 0:14:24,88
going to shoot.
