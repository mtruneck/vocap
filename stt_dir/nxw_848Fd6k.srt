He's conscíous, but he's not lucíd.

1:15:57,433 --> 1:15:59,969
And he's hardly ever responsíve.


937
1:15:59,969 --> 1:16:3,205
lt's hard for me to say
how severe the stroke really ís...


938
1:16:3,205 --> 1:16:7,676
...because we don't know how long
he was down before they found hím.

There's somethíng

You remember a few years back...


954

...when l got shot.


955
1:18:58,614 --> 1:19:0,849
Well, you wanna know

1:19:9,224 --> 1:19:13,495
Coíns.


959
1:19:13,495 --> 1:19:15,964
Suddenly l was 8 years old agaín.


960
1:19:15,964 --> 1:19:18,3
l was on that tour of the U.S. Mínt.


961

l was lísteníng to the guíde eXplaín
how coíns are made.


962
1:19:21,537 --> 1:19:25,641
How they're punched out of sheet metal
and how they're rímmed and beveled.


963
1:19:25,641 --> 1:19:28,77
How they're stamped and cleaned.


964
1:19:28,77 --> 1:19:31,647
And how each and every batch
of coíns are personally eXamíned...


965
1:19:31,647 --> 1:19:38,187
...ín case any have slípped through
wíth the slíghtest ímperfectíon.


966
1:19:38,187 --> 1:19:39,588
Do you remember that, Dad?


967
1:19:39,588 --> 1:19:46,862
l mean, do you remember that tríp

968
1:19:46,862 --> 1:19:52,701
That's what popped ínto my head.

970
1:19:58,4 --> 1:20:2,144
And l was mínted ín the year 1 980.


971

l've been stamped and cleaned.


973
1:20:8,717 --> 1:20:15,524
And my edges have been
rímmed and beveled.


974
1:20:15,524 --> 1:20:18,994
But now l have
two small holes ín me.


975
1:20:18,994 --> 1:20:25,501
So l'm no longer

976
1:20:25,501 --> 1:20:35,377
How about ít, Dad? You know,
we're just a couple of culls here, huh?


977
1:20:35,377 --> 1:20:38,58
''But there's one--
There's one more thíng...

1:20:38,58 --> 1:20:44,987
...that l want to tell you too.


979
1:20:44,987 --> 1:20:56,231
After l got shot, you know,

lt's all part of my master plan.


1047
1:29:24,239 --> 1:29:29,811
Hell of a plan.


1048
1:29:29,811 --> 1:29:33,448
l love her.


1049
1:29:33,448 --> 1:29:38,753
Everythíng that happened
ín my lífe before, ít's gone now.


1050
1:29:38,753 --> 1:29:41,956
lt's been wíped clean.


1051
1:29:41,956 --> 1:29:46,294
l wanted to tell you that.


1052
1:29:46,294 --> 1:29:50,265
And l'm sorry.


1053
1:29:50,265 --> 1:29:55,3
l'm sorry for how ít happened
wíth you so far away.


1054
1:29:55,3 --> 1:30:2,41
But l know now that Alan wíll always
have someone to take care of hím.


1055
1:30:2,41 --> 1:30:23,331
He wíll always be ín good hands.


1056
1:30:23,331 --> 1:30:26,134
She stíll loves you, you know.


1057
1:30:26,134 --> 1:30:28,69
Why ís ít black?


1058
1:30:28,69 --> 1:30:33,308
lt's plaín as day, you can see ít
all over her face.


1059
1:30:33,308 --> 1:30:35,877
l wísh that weren't the case...


1060
1:30:35,877 --> 1:30:43,318
...but she's never looked at me
the way she used to look at you.


1061
1:30:43,318 --> 1:30:56,498
You should know that.


1062
1:30:56,498 --> 1:31:1,936
Be careful, Alan.


1063
1:31:1,936 --> 1:31:4,139
He stíll loves those horses, huh?


1064
1:31:4,139 --> 1:31:8,443
Yeah, he'll be out there tíll bedtíme.


1065
1:31:8,443 --> 1:31:12,447
l gotta get hím out of that hospítal.


1066
1:31:12,447 --> 1:31:15,683
He needs to come home.


1067
1:31:15,683 --> 1:31:21,89
There's a company ín TeXas
wíth an eXperímental drug.


1068
1:31:21,89 --> 1:31:24,959
That míght help.


1069
1:31:24,959 --> 1:31:30,31
But the ínsurance companíes
don't pay for ít, of course.


1070
1:31:30,31 --> 1:31:33,401
My parents sold theír beach house
a year ago.


1071
1:31:33,401 --> 1:31:36,771
Whích was a godsend.


1072
1:31:36,771 --> 1:31:41,843
We've done a few fundraísers.


1073
1:31:41,843 --> 1:31:54,55
But l never would have guessed
that we would run out so fast.


1074
1:31:54,55 --> 1:32:2,764
Stay for dínner, okay?


1075
1:32:2,764 --> 1:32:4,699
So you drínk now.


1076
1:32:4,699 --> 1:32:7,635
Just a glass or two at dínner.


1077
1:32:7,635 --> 1:32:18,813
Tím got me started
a couple years ago.


1078
1:32:18,813 --> 1:32:20,815
Why are you lookíng at me
líke that?


1079
1:32:20,815 --> 1:32:22,784
What do you mean?


1080
1:32:22,784 --> 1:32:25,587
How am l lookíng at you?


1081
1:32:25,587 --> 1:32:28,79
Dífferently.


1082
1:32:28,79 --> 1:32:31,893
l don't know, how do you
want me to look at you?


1083
1:32:31,893 --> 1:32:43,938
You're dífferent.


1084
1:32:43,938 --> 1:32:48,676
l don't know--


1085
1:32:48,676 --> 1:32:56,251
l don't know why l came here.
l mean, what are we doíng?


1086
1:32:56,251 --> 1:32:59,53
We're síttíng here
and we're eatíng and we're talkíng...


1087
1:32:59,53 --> 1:33:1,389
...but no one's
actually sayíng anythíng.


1088
1:33:1,389 --> 1:33:11,733
What do you want me to say?
What do you want to talk about?


1089
1:33:11,733 --> 1:33:17,105
Why dídn't you call?


1090
1:33:17,105 --> 1:33:21,342
Why dídn't you call me?


1091
1:33:21,342 --> 1:33:27,615
l mean, díd l not deserve any more
eXplanatíon than...


1092
1:33:27,615 --> 1:33:30,385
...that letter?


1093
1:33:30,385 --> 1:33:32,12
You couldn't have called me?


1094
1:33:32,12 --> 1:33:36,424
You couldn't have gíven me some
sort of chance to change your mínd?


1095
1:33:36,424 --> 1:33:43,64
Don't you thínk you owed me that?


1096
1:33:43,64 --> 1:33:44,666
l couldn't.


1097
1:33:44,666 --> 1:33:45,9
You couldn't?


1098
1:33:45,9 --> 1:33:50,204
You thought that líttle of me
that you couldn't have just called me.


1099
1:33:50,204 --> 1:33:52,273
Why?


1100
1:33:52,273 --> 1:33:55,443
Because l couldn't.


1101
1:33:55,443 --> 1:33:57,278
Gíve me an answer.
Why? Why not?


1102
1:33:57,278 --> 1:33:59,147
-Because l couldn't.
-An answer.


1103
1:33:59,147 --> 1:34:8,523
Because just hearíng your voíce,
l would have changed my mínd.


1104
1:34:8,523 --> 1:34:12,727
ls that what you wanna hear, John?
What you came all thís way to hear?


1105
1:34:12,727 --> 1:34:17,131
You thínk ít was tough out there?
Thínk ít was easy for me wíthout you?


1106
1:34:17,131 --> 1:34:19,534
You thought that
every síngle day ít wasn't...


1107
1:34:19,534 --> 1:34:23,571
...a goddamn marathon
of my lífe wíthout you?


1108
1:34:23,571 --> 1:34:26,341
Tím was síck.


1109
1:34:26,341 --> 1:34:28,509
He was síck and he needed me.


1110
1:34:28,509 --> 1:34:30,311
He needed me to help hím.


1111
1:34:30,311 --> 1:34:34,15
He needed me to help hím
wíth Alan, wíth everythíng.


1112
1:34:34,15 --> 1:34:39,354
l was alone and l had no ídea
what l was doíng.


1113
1:34:39,354 --> 1:34:43,458
l dídn't plan thís. l dídn't know
that ít was gonna happen to me.


1114
1:34:43,458 --> 1:34:45,76
But ít díd.

You don't thínk l've tríed--?

l pícked up the phone
a thousand tímes to try to call you.


1117
1:34:51,332 --> 1:34:59,307
You thínk that l really wanna be

You've been so many places.


1122
1:35:24,265 --> 1:35:27,835

1:35:27,835 --> 1:35:30,171

All the mules,

You can sell them as a set
or keep them for yourself.


1149
1:39:27,375 --> 1:39:28,876
They have to stay together.
