0:1:13,766 --> 0:1:18,7
Leaving Africa was virtually impossible,

Can I find their trail out of Africa and across the world?

what did we come from?


126
0:11:33,886 --> 0:11:37,966
The evidence suggests that the very first human-like creatures


127
0:11:37,966 --> 0:11:42,246
evolved in Africa over four million years ago.


128
0:11:42,246 --> 0:11:45,726
They were much more ape-like than us.

130
0:11:49,927 --> 0:11:52,447

0:11:55,647 --> 0:11:59,647

136
0:12:14,407 --> 0:12:17,447
If We compare it With this modern skull,


137
0:12:17,447 --> 0:12:20,167
some things just leap out at you.


138
0:12:20,167 --> 0:12:23,606
This heidelbergensis skull has an enormous broW ridge


139
0:12:23,606 --> 0:12:27,206
and a sWept-back, sloping forehead.


140
0:12:27,206 --> 0:12:29,527
Much steeper in the modern skull.


141
0:12:29,527 --> 0:12:35,447
In fact, the Whole brain case here is much rounder.


142
0:12:35,447 --> 0:12:38,126
Using the skull of the ancient human,


143
0:12:38,126 --> 0:12:43,47
experts have reconstructed his face,


144
0:12:43,47 --> 0:12:45,647
to reveal our flatter-headed,


145
0:12:45,647 --> 0:12:53,966
beetle-browed predecessor.


146
0:12:53,966 --> 0:13:0,966
In contrast With this reconstruction of a very old but modern human,


147
0:13:0,966 --> 0:13:8,807
and I think you'll agree that she looks a lot more like me.


148
0:13:8,807 --> 0:13:12,606
But if East Africa is where the first humans were born,


149
0:13:12,606 --> 0:13:19,246
there are some big questions to answer.


150
0:13:19,246 --> 0:13:23,326
Are we all descended from black Africans?


151
0:13:23,326 --> 0:13:35,726
If so, why do most of us look so different?


152
0:13:35,726 --> 0:13:40,246
And how could a handful of people from such an isolated place


153
0:13:40,246 --> 0:13:44,927
go on to colonise first Africa


154
0:13:44,927 --> 0:13:54,246
and then the rest of the world?


155
0:13:54,246 --> 0:14:0,366
So what do we know about these shadowy first families?


156
0:14:0,366 --> 0:14:2,647
200,000 years ago,


157
0:14:2,647 --> 0:14:8,126
it's likely there were so few of them, living such a precarious existence,


158
0:14:8,126 --> 0:14:14,486
that today they'd be classified as an endangered species.


159
0:14:14,486 --> 0:14:17,206
Life was fragile.


160
0:14:17,206 --> 0:14:41,366
And the African savannah was a dangerous place.


161
0:14:41,366 --> 0:14:44,767
Well, I'm going to be spending the night out here in the bush -


162
0:14:44,767 --> 0:14:47,687
presumably something our ancestors did all the time,


163
0:14:47,687 --> 0:14:52,807
but years of living in civilisation have softened me.


164
0:14:52,807 --> 0:14:56,287
I've got a big torch here, so that if anything comes by


165
0:14:56,287 --> 0:14:58,366
I can get a better look at it in the dark.


166

167
0:15:1,567 --> 0:15:4,807
so I can make a video diary throughout the night


168
0:15:4,807 --> 0:15:8,366
and talk about What comes along.

(ANIMAL CALLING)


194
0:17:6,446 --> 0:17:7,567
Is that...


195
0:17:7,567 --> 0:17:9,767
(ANIMAL CALLING)


196
0:17:9,767 --> 0:17:13,807
Is that a hyena?


197
0:17:13,807 --> 0:17:17,326
(ANIMAL CALLING)


198
0:17:17,326 --> 0:17:20,406
Oh, I don't like that noise.


199
0:17:20,406 --> 0:17:22,166
That's really spooky.


200
0:17:22,166 --> 0:17:33,446
(ANIMAL CALLING)


201
0:17:33,446 --> 0:17:39,446
That's got to be one of the most frightening nights of my life.


202
0:17:39,446 --> 0:17:41,166
I did get some sleep,


203
0:17:41,166 --> 0:17:45,487
but then I got Woken up by these horrendous noises.


204
0:17:45,487 --> 0:17:47,967
Sometimes it Was hyenas.


205
0:17:47,967 --> 0:17:50,287
And then there Was something that sounded


206
0:17:50,287 --> 0:17:52,606
like a standoff betWeen a hyena and a leopard


207
0:17:52,606 --> 0:17:56,807
or some... I don't knoW What it Was. AWful noises.


208
0:17:56,807 --> 0:18:6,606
Really, really scary.


209
0:18:6,606 --> 0:18:10,86
With the return of the crew, I pluck up my courage


210
0:18:10,86 --> 0:18:18,7
and look for signs of the animals that I heard in the night.


211
0:18:18,7 --> 0:18:23,846
God, just look at this. This is a big, male leopard paW print.


212
0:18:23,846 --> 0:18:28,606
And there are large hyena prints as Well.


213
0:18:28,606 --> 0:18:31,366
So these predators, these carnivores,


214
0:18:31,366 --> 0:18:33,767
Were literally here, about 25 metres aWay


215
0:18:33,767 --> 0:18:36,287
from Where I Was sleeping,


216
0:18:36,287 --> 0:18:38,846
underneath that tree.


217
0:18:38,846 --> 0:18:41,767
They sounded really close during the night.


218
0:18:41,767 --> 0:18:51,126
And I can see noW that they Were.


219
0:18:51,126 --> 0:18:52,807
At night-time especially,


220
0:18:52,807 --> 0:18:57,646
our ancestors must have been very vulnerable.


221
0:18:57,646 --> 0:19:1,86
So how did those first families survive,


222
0:19:1,86 --> 0:19:15,126
let alone go on to spread across the world?


223
0:19:15,126 --> 0:19:32,967
In the hope of finding out more, I'm heading south to Namibia.


224
0:19:32,967 --> 0:19:37,686
I'm meeting one of the last groups of hunter-gatherers on this continent,


225
0:19:37,686 --> 0:19:41,606
the Bushmen of the Kalahari.


226
0:19:41,606 --> 0:19:43,967
-What's your name? -My name is Sedray.


227
0:19:43,967 --> 0:19:49,326
-Sedray? -Sedray.


228
0:19:49,326 --> 0:19:51,7
(COUGHING)


229
0:19:51,7 --> 0:19:58,406
Their Way of life is the closest I can find to that of our ancestors.


230
0:19:58,406 --> 0:20:1,807
(SPEAKING KHOISAN LANGUAGE)


231
0:20:1,807 --> 0:20:7,527
The Bushmen are expert hunters.


232
0:20:7,527 --> 0:20:10,86
But before I see hoW they do it,


233
0:20:10,86 --> 0:20:15,846
I Want to persuade Un and Lau to take part in a little experiment.


234
0:20:15,846 --> 0:20:20,326
Un, I need to check your body temperature using this.


235
0:20:20,326 --> 0:20:23,247
Is that all right? I'm going to put it in your ear, like that.


236
0:20:23,247 --> 0:20:24,767
-Yeah. -Stick it in your ear.


237
0:20:24,767 --> 0:20:31,7
-Mmm-hmm. -Right. Just going to pop it in there.


238
0:20:31,7 --> 0:20:32,686
(THERMOMETER BEEPING)


239
0:20:32,686 --> 0:20:34,7
Lovely.


240
0:20:34,7 --> 0:20:37,47
-36.2 -HoW is it?


241
0:20:37,47 --> 0:20:39,207
-That's hoW hot you are. -There's my ears.


242
0:20:39,207 --> 0:20:40,686
-Yes. -Okay.


243
0:20:40,686 --> 0:20:42,846
And Lau, I need to do it to you as Well.


244
0:20:42,846 --> 0:20:46,967
There We go, it's ready to take your temperature.

(THERMOMETER BEEPING)


246
0:20:48,366 --> 0:20:51,7
Right. 35.8.


247
0:20:51,7 --> 0:20:57,487
So you're even cooler. You're very cool.


248
0:20:57,487 --> 0:20:59,7
(LAUGHING)


249
0:20:59,7 --> 0:21:13,406
It's turned into a competition.


250
0:21:13,406 --> 0:21:15,727
Humans usually hunt in the day.


251
0:21:15,727 --> 0:21:19,606
So I want to see how our bodies cope with this blazing heat.


252
0:21:19,606 --> 0:21:23,166
It's a pretty relentless pace.


253
0:21:23,166 --> 0:21:35,646
We're looking for the trail of an antelope.


254
0:21:35,646 --> 0:21:38,47
What have you found?


255
0:21:38,47 --> 0:21:42,7
(SPEAKING KHOISAN LANGUAGE)


256
0:21:42,7 --> 0:21:44,686
(WHISPERING) Oh, yeah. Right, this is really exciting.


257
0:21:44,686 --> 0:21:48,487
We've got an oryx track. And We're going to folloW it.


258
0:21:48,487 --> 0:21:58,406
I'm going to have to be really quiet noW.


259
0:21:58,406 --> 0:22:10,86
We've got to move fast to gain on the oryx.


260
0:22:10,86 --> 0:22:16,247
We've been walking and running for over an hour, when we find more prints.


261
0:22:16,247 --> 0:22:21,166
But not the ones we were hoping for.

(SPEAKING KHOISAN LANGUAGE)


263
0:22:23,606 --> 0:22:25,606
I think We give up the chase at this point.


264
0:22:25,606 --> 0:22:27,606
The animal's being chased by a hyena.


265
0:22:27,606 --> 0:22:30,926
Don't knoW if it'll live to tell the tale, either.


266
0:22:30,926 --> 0:22:35,446
But no dinner for us.


267
0:22:35,446 --> 0:22:40,366
It's now just past midday and the temperature is in the high 30s.


268
0:22:40,366 --> 0:22:42,727
So what effect has all this running in the heat


269
0:22:42,727 --> 0:22:46,406
had on our body temperatures?


270
0:22:46,406 --> 0:22:50,646
Uh, 37.4, so a bit hotter than you Were before.


271
0:22:50,646 --> 0:22:53,646

0:22:59,686 --> 0:23:5,567

(THERMOMETER BEEPING)


277
0:23:6,926 --> 0:23:8,926
Thanks. 36.9!


278

-Ohh! -We beat him.


279
0:23:10,487 --> 0:23:13,727
Incredibly, our temperatures have barely risen.


280
0:23:13,727 --> 0:23:16,446
Well, the key to this is that We're all regulating our body temperatures


281
0:23:16,446 --> 0:23:23,126
even in this heat.


282
0:23:23,126 --> 0:23:25,326
And this is the secret.


283
0:23:25,326 --> 0:23:27,487
We keep cool by sweating.


284
0:23:27,487 --> 0:23:32,606
Something humans do more effectively than most mammals.


285
0:23:32,606 --> 0:23:38,446
Not having fur, we can sweat from glands all over our bodies,


286
0:23:38,446 --> 0:23:42,886
which allows us to keep moving in pursuit of prey for hours


287
0:23:42,886 --> 0:23:46,366
without overheating.


288
0:23:46,366 --> 0:23:48,846
Even in the middle of the day,


289
0:23:48,846 --> 0:23:55,767
when most big predators are just trying to keep cool.


290
0:23:55,767 --> 0:23:58,287
And there are other things about your body


291
0:23:58,287 --> 0:24:3,406
designed specifically for running.


292
0:24:3,406 --> 0:24:6,686
And this is one of them. Yes, it's a foot.


293
0:24:6,686 --> 0:24:10,247
And it is brilliantly designed to provide spring.


294
0:24:10,247 --> 0:24:13,886
The ligaments and tendons support the sprung arches of the foot


295
0:24:13,886 --> 0:24:17,487
so that every time our foot hits the ground, the spring stores


296
0:24:17,487 --> 0:24:23,807
and then releases energy, making running more efficient.


297
0:24:23,807 --> 0:24:27,767
And there's a really important muscle in our bums.


298
0:24:27,767 --> 0:24:30,646
Our gluteus maximus muscle is huge


299
0:24:30,646 --> 0:24:33,287
and We hardly use it at all When We're Walking.


300
0:24:33,287 --> 0:24:40,886
But it comes into its oWn When We run.


301
0:24:40,886 --> 0:24:44,686
So all of these adaptations suggest that running,


302
0:24:44,686 --> 0:24:46,807
especially over long distances,


303
0:24:46,807 --> 0:24:55,967
Was really important to our early ancestors.


304
0:24:55,967 --> 0:24:57,406
But there was something else


305
0:24:57,406 --> 0:25:2,487
that may have really given our ancient ancestors the edge.


306
0:25:2,487 --> 0:25:10,207
(SPEAKING KHOISAN LANGUAGE)


307
0:25:10,207 --> 0:25:11,487
Language.


308
0:25:11,487 --> 0:25:19,86
The ability to communicate and plan.


309
0:25:19,86 --> 0:25:21,846
Red, yelloW, green.


310
0:25:21,846 --> 0:25:23,406
HoW do you say it?


311
0:25:23,406 --> 0:25:29,606
(SPEAKING KHOISAN LANGUAGE)


312
0:25:29,606 --> 0:25:32,567
We don't know when people started to speak,


313
0:25:32,567 --> 0:25:36,967
but there's evidence that languages like this, click languages,


314
0:25:36,967 --> 0:25:40,967
may be the oldest in the world.


315
0:25:40,967 --> 0:25:45,846
(SPEAKING KHOISAN LANGUAGE)


316
0:25:45,846 --> 0:25:50,767
So it's possible that the first families sounded a bit like this.


317
0:25:50,767 --> 0:25:52,646
It is an amazing language.


318
0:25:52,646 --> 0:25:56,886
Every sentence is peppered With these clicks and tutting noises


319
0:25:56,886 --> 0:25:58,446
that are consonants.


320
0:25:58,446 --> 0:26:1,846
They're just very unlike any consonants that I'm used to pronouncing.


321
0:26:1,846 --> 0:26:3,326
So I'm struggling With it.


322
0:26:3,326 --> 0:26:4,686
So this is...


323
0:26:4,686 --> 0:26:11,807
(SPEAKING KHOISAN LANGUAGE)


324
0:26:11,807 --> 0:26:12,926
(LAUGHING)


325
0:26:12,926 --> 0:26:19,166
See, I think it's easier to say yelloW.


326
0:26:19,166 --> 0:26:21,886
And it's a type of language


327
0:26:21,886 --> 0:26:26,606
that could have been crucial to our ancestors' survival.


328
0:26:26,606 --> 0:26:30,567
It may be that these click languages have been around for so long


329
0:26:30,567 --> 0:26:34,287
because they're particularly useful during hunting.


330
0:26:34,287 --> 0:26:36,686
Apparently, When the Bushmen are stalking an animal,


331
0:26:36,686 --> 0:26:39,366
they drop their voices to a Whisper


332
0:26:39,366 --> 0:26:42,86
so they're talking almost entirely in clicks,


333
0:26:42,86 --> 0:26:43,686
Which makes a lot of sense to me.


334
0:26:43,686 --> 0:26:47,326
The clicks are high-pitched noises that don't travel far through the bush,


335
0:26:47,326 --> 0:26:51,86
so the hunters aren't going to scare off their quarry.


336
0:26:51,86 --> 0:27:1,166
(SPEAKING KHOISAN LANGUAGE)


337
0:27:1,166 --> 0:27:7,126
Equipped with language and hunting skills, we flourished.


338
0:27:7,126 --> 0:27:12,406
And began to do something else.. spread out.


339
0:27:12,406 --> 0:27:15,207
We don't know for sure which routes they took,


340
0:27:15,207 --> 0:27:18,247
but new evidence shows that very early on,


341
0:27:18,247 --> 0:27:27,686
modern humans were living at the extreme southern edge of the continent.


342
0:27:27,686 --> 0:27:31,247
I'm heading along the South African coast


343
0:27:31,247 --> 0:27:38,646
to a place called Pinnacle Point.


344
0:27:38,646 --> 0:27:42,527
Today it's a playground for the rich.


345
0:27:42,527 --> 0:27:45,366
But during the construction of this golf course,


346
0:27:45,366 --> 0:27:48,646
archaeologists discovered something amazing


347
0:27:48,646 --> 0:28:1,727
deep beneath the fairway.


348
0:28:1,727 --> 0:28:5,487
This could be the oldest knoWn dWelling of our species


349
0:28:5,487 --> 0:28:12,767
anyWhere in the World.


350
0:28:12,767 --> 0:28:17,326
-So this is Where you've been digging? -This is the oldest part of the cave.


351
0:28:17,326 --> 0:28:20,247
And What are the dates here, then, as We go doWn through these layers?


352
0:28:20,247 --> 0:28:24,567
Uh, these layers date from 130,000 to 167,000 years ago.


353
0:28:24,567 --> 0:28:27,926
-It's just so incredibly ancient. -It's amazing.


354
0:28:27,926 --> 0:28:32,487
Did you knoW hoW important What you Were excavating really Was?


355
0:28:32,487 --> 0:28:34,846
Not until We got those dates.


356
0:28:34,846 --> 0:28:43,287
But, yeah. Amazing, stunning.


357
0:28:43,287 --> 0:28:47,446
ROBERTS: The evidence in this cave reveals that those ancient families


358
0:28:47,446 --> 0:28:54,7
were behaving in ways quite unlike previous species of human.


359
0:28:54,7 --> 0:28:56,606
Well, Kyle, that's not from this cave, is it? 'Cause I recognise this.


360
0:28:56,606 --> 0:28:58,207
This is a hand axe, isn't it?


361
0:28:58,207 --> 0:29:0,527
That's correct. NoW, that's more typical of What you Would find


362
0:29:0,527 --> 0:29:4,86
from about a million and a half years ago to about 300,000 years ago.


363
0:29:4,86 --> 0:29:7,446
So, What sort of thing Were you finding in the cave, then?


364
0:29:7,446 --> 0:29:9,406
Okay, Well, tools like these.


365
0:29:9,406 --> 0:29:13,86
Blades and points are much more typical of What We find in this cave.


366
0:29:13,86 --> 0:29:17,7
Made on quartzite, locally available on the beach doWn here.


367
0:29:17,7 --> 0:29:20,487
And in our oldest levels here, alongside these types of tools,


368
0:29:20,487 --> 0:29:23,326
We also have these very small bladelet tools.


369
0:29:23,326 --> 0:29:25,126
These are tiny.


370
0:29:25,126 --> 0:29:29,527
What could such minute blades have been used for?


371
0:29:29,527 --> 0:29:32,846
Obviously, these Weren't used just in your hand like this,


372
0:29:32,846 --> 0:29:34,727
so hoW Would they have been used?


373
0:29:34,727 --> 0:29:37,86
It's more likely that those Were set in some kind of a handle


374
0:29:37,86 --> 0:29:39,446
to make a compound tool.


375
0:29:39,446 --> 0:29:41,166
Maybe something more like this.


376
0:29:41,166 --> 0:29:46,967
This is a series of small blades set into a handle for use as a knife.


377
0:29:46,967 --> 0:29:49,247
Yes, I think that Would Work.


378
0:29:49,247 --> 0:29:52,926
So you think that's hoW these stone tools Were used, then, as a knife?


379
0:29:52,926 --> 0:29:55,126
Um, that's one possibility.


380
0:29:55,126 --> 0:30:1,247
And it's also possible they Would have been used for hunting Weapons.


381
0:30:1,247 --> 0:30:3,247
ROBERTS: Kyle and his team have discovered


382
0:30:3,247 --> 0:30:7,487
you can make some lethal weapons with these bladelets.


383
0:30:7,487 --> 0:30:9,886
This one looks particularly vicious, I think.


384
0:30:9,886 --> 0:30:11,606
This is one interpretation of hoW


385
0:30:11,606 --> 0:30:17,567
those small back blades might have been mounted.


386
0:30:17,567 --> 0:30:20,406
The advantage to this Would be that there's these barbs


387
0:30:20,406 --> 0:30:23,886
that Would prevent the tip from pulling out immediately,


388
0:30:23,886 --> 0:30:28,686
um, and Would inflict a greater injury.


389
0:30:28,686 --> 0:30:32,7
ROBERTS: So by 160,000 years ago,


390
0:30:32,7 --> 0:30:48,86
those early resourceful families seem to have colonised much of Africa.


391
0:30:48,86 --> 0:30:52,926
But what about the rest of the world?


392
0:30:52,926 --> 0:30:57,287
How did some of those ancient wanderers get out of Africa


393
0:30:57,287 --> 0:31:1,767
to become me, and perhaps you?


394
0:31:1,767 --> 0:31:15,446
It's one of the most baffling mysteries of our origins.


395
0:31:15,446 --> 0:31:23,166
Africa south of the Sahara is cut off from the rest of the planet.


396
0:31:23,166 --> 0:31:32,126
To the west, south and east, ocean.


397
0:31:32,126 --> 0:31:41,527
To the north, the vast deserts of the Sahara and Arabia.


398
0:31:41,527 --> 0:31:43,767
So could there be another way


399
0:31:43,767 --> 0:31:49,686
that people first appeared all over the world?


400
0:31:49,686 --> 0:31:52,166
Did they, as some have suggested,


401
0:31:52,166 --> 0:31:55,446
evolve separately on different continents?


402
0:31:55,446 --> 0:32:2,326
It's a huge question.


403
0:32:2,326 --> 0:32:3,846
A different branch of science


404
0:32:3,846 --> 0:32:7,846
is beginning to provide very surprising answers.


405
0:32:7,846 --> 0:32:13,646
To find out more, I've come to Cape Town.


406
0:32:13,646 --> 0:32:17,846
Cape ToWn today is a World city With representatives of just about


407
0:32:17,846 --> 0:32:21,406
every group and creed you can possibly imagine.


408
0:32:21,406 --> 0:32:25,926
And every single one of these people unknoWingly carries inside them


409
0:32:25,926 --> 0:32:29,406
a story of their ancient ancestors.


410
0:32:29,406 --> 0:32:33,646
That's because, buried in the genes of each of us,


411
0:32:33,646 --> 0:32:39,886
is an indelible record of our past.


412
0:32:39,886 --> 0:32:43,646
By studying DNA from people all over the world,


413
0:32:43,646 --> 0:32:49,247
geneticists are piecing together that ancient story.


414
0:32:49,247 --> 0:32:52,406
Cape Town, a product of its colonial past,


415
0:32:52,406 --> 0:32:55,527
has citizens who bring their own genetic stories


416
0:32:55,527 --> 0:33:0,47
from every corner of the planet.


417
0:33:0,47 --> 0:33:4,567
And the minute differences in their DNA provide clues


418
0:33:4,567 --> 0:33:11,287
about the ancient migrations that led our species to colonise the world.


419
0:33:11,287 --> 0:33:16,326
Thanks again, folks, for coming. This is the tree of humanity, okay?


420
0:33:16,326 --> 0:33:20,86
ROBERTS: geneticist Raj Ramesar has used these differences


421
0:33:20,86 --> 0:33:23,247
to help build a global family tree


422
0:33:23,247 --> 0:33:28,207
by tracing genes down the female line.


423
0:33:28,207 --> 0:33:31,366
Our modern genes are the branches of the tree,


424
0:33:31,366 --> 0:33:38,686
and geneticists have followed them back in time to find our ancient roots.


425
0:33:38,686 --> 0:33:45,646
The DNA of everyone alive today fits somewhere on this tree.


426
0:33:45,646 --> 0:33:49,247
Although it's not always obvious exactly where you fit.


427
0:33:49,247 --> 0:33:50,686
Steven, What about you?


428
0:33:50,686 --> 0:33:54,47
Where do you think your maternal heritage stems from?


429
0:33:54,47 --> 0:33:55,247
Probably southern Europe.


430
0:33:55,247 --> 0:33:58,767
Um, just the Italian community, that's Where my family comes from.


431
0:33:58,767 --> 0:34:2,47
Well, actually, you are on a European branch,


432
0:34:2,47 --> 0:34:5,846
but you're on a European branch up here, and that's much more northern Europe.


433
0:34:5,846 --> 0:34:7,926
So I'm very sorry, Steven, you're not Italian.


434
0:34:7,926 --> 0:34:10,847
You're a Laplander.


435
0:34:10,847 --> 0:34:13,567
But follow the branches back to the beginning


436
0:34:13,567 --> 0:34:21,126
and the tree reveals that ultimately we all have our roots in the same place.


437
0:34:21,126 --> 0:34:23,126
There's no question from the genetic data


438
0:34:23,126 --> 0:34:25,126
that is generated on the people here,


439
0:34:25,126 --> 0:34:27,286
as Well as other studies that have been done,


440
0:34:27,286 --> 0:34:29,487
that humanity arose in Africa.


441
0:34:29,487 --> 0:34:33,407
And that's Where the depth of this thick trunk illustrates


442
0:34:33,407 --> 0:34:36,726
Where the majority of humanity can look for its roots.


443
0:34:36,726 --> 0:34:38,126
So because We originated in Africa,


444
0:34:38,126 --> 0:34:41,447
there's been more time for branches to develop here


445
0:34:41,447 --> 0:34:45,86
-than there has been anyWhere else. -Yeah, that's a crucial point.


446
0:34:45,86 --> 0:34:49,47
Humanity has spent most of its life in Africa.


447
0:34:49,47 --> 0:34:50,447
I'm African?


448
0:34:50,447 --> 0:34:51,967
(LAUGHING)


449
0:34:51,967 --> 0:34:55,47
-Yes, my cousin. -We all are.


450
0:34:55,47 --> 0:34:56,447
Absolutely.


451
0:34:56,447 --> 0:35:2,686
It's only more recently that We see this aspect of the tree.


452
0:35:2,686 --> 0:35:4,606
ROBERTS: But the really amazing thing


453
0:35:4,606 --> 0:35:11,206
is what the tree tells us about those who left Africa.


454
0:35:11,206 --> 0:35:15,646
You might expect lots of branches, lots of genetic lineages,


455
0:35:15,646 --> 0:35:20,126
leaving Africa at different times.


456
0:35:20,126 --> 0:35:25,246
But instead, the rest of the world connects back to Africa


457
0:35:25,246 --> 0:35:29,686
through one thin branch.


458
0:35:29,686 --> 0:35:32,726
What does that mean?


459
0:35:32,726 --> 0:35:35,766
There Was a single branching out of Africa.


460
0:35:35,766 --> 0:35:39,967
It amounts to, historically, a single band of individuals


461
0:35:39,967 --> 0:35:41,686
leaving the African continent.


462
0:35:41,686 --> 0:35:47,7
So that Was the original migration out of Africa that We can track With DNA.


463
0:35:47,7 --> 0:35:50,806
From there, there Were branchings out in many different directions


464
0:35:50,806 --> 0:35:55,766
into Europe, into the rest of Asia, Eurasia and to the north,


465
0:35:55,766 --> 0:35:58,447
and then doWn to Australia and Japan


466
0:35:58,447 --> 0:36:1,726
and ultimately to the Americas on the other side.


467
0:36:1,726 --> 0:36:5,967
ROBERTS: geneticists across the world have come to the same conclusions..


468
0:36:5,967 --> 0:36:9,766
everyone outside Africa descends from not many,


469
0:36:9,766 --> 0:36:13,927
but just one tiny group of pioneers.


470
0:36:13,927 --> 0:36:16,166
I just think it's absolutely remarkable.


471
0:36:16,166 --> 0:36:19,527
Isn't that amazing? It's stunning. Yeah.


472
0:36:19,527 --> 0:36:29,126
Oh, WoW, man.


473
0:36:29,126 --> 0:36:32,367
ROBERTS: It may be that others tried, too.


474
0:36:32,367 --> 0:36:37,686
But their descendants have not survived.


475
0:36:37,686 --> 0:36:40,887
So the genetics tells us our species


476
0:36:40,887 --> 0:36:44,487
made just one successful attempt to leave.


477
0:36:44,487 --> 0:36:46,527
And this Wasn't a mass exodus.


478
0:36:46,527 --> 0:36:51,806
It Was a small group of people taking one route out of Africa.


479
0:36:51,806 --> 0:36:54,847
And everybody in the World today Who isn't African


480
0:36:54,847 --> 0:36:58,646
is descended from that handful of people.


481
0:36:58,646 --> 0:37:3,246
It's just mind-boggling to think hoW different the World Would be today


482
0:37:3,246 --> 0:37:7,766
if it Weren't for that small group of pioneers.


483
0:37:7,766 --> 0:37:9,686
And it begs the next question:


484
0:37:9,686 --> 0:37:14,166
Which route did they take?


485
0:37:14,166 --> 0:37:25,126
The genetics may be convincing, but the geography is a huge problem.


486
0:37:25,126 --> 0:37:28,766
For these early families, deserts and oceans


487
0:37:28,766 --> 0:37:36,806
would have been massive obstacles.


488
0:37:36,806 --> 0:37:43,126
But we know they did it somehow.


489
0:37:43,126 --> 0:37:48,806
From this map, I think there are perhaps four possible routes out of Africa.


490
0:37:48,806 --> 0:37:53,47
Across the Straits of Gibraltar here, so a bit of a sea crossing,


491
0:37:53,47 --> 0:37:55,327
from Tunisia up through Sicily and Italy -


492
0:37:55,327 --> 0:37:57,646
even more sea to cross there -


493
0:37:57,646 --> 0:38:0,447
doWn here across the mouth of the Red Sea,


494
0:38:0,447 --> 0:38:4,86
but you'd need a boat for that, as Well.


495
0:38:4,86 --> 0:38:8,487
Or here, through the Sahara and Sinai deserts.


496
0:38:8,487 --> 0:38:10,967
Well, all of those routes have their challenges,


497
0:38:10,967 --> 0:38:14,606
but We knoW that it Was just one of them that Was taken.


498
0:38:14,606 --> 0:38:22,327
So Which one Was it?


499
0:38:22,327 --> 0:38:24,286
It's a real puzzle.


500
0:38:24,286 --> 0:38:30,367
But could it be that the world was different back then?


501
0:38:30,367 --> 0:38:37,86
Well, there is a way to find out.


502
0:38:37,86 --> 0:38:40,847
We've asked a team of Britain's leading climate scientists


503
0:38:40,847 --> 0:38:44,606
to work out how the global environment has changed,


504
0:38:44,606 --> 0:38:52,766
going back over thousands of years.


505
0:38:52,766 --> 0:38:54,686
And the ansWer is in here.


506
0:38:54,686 --> 0:38:59,806
With this climate computer, I can look at the changing environment over time.


507
0:38:59,806 --> 0:39:6,86
Starting at 140,000 years ago, we're moving towards the present.


508
0:39:6,86 --> 0:39:13,527
Forests and grasslands are green, and deserts light brown.


509
0:39:13,527 --> 0:39:15,527
NoW, this is interesting.


510
0:39:15,527 --> 0:39:18,967
1 25,000 years ago,


511
0:39:18,967 --> 0:39:20,686
there's a change in the climate.


512
0:39:20,686 --> 0:39:29,126
It's been very dry in this area and then suddenly it gets greener.


513
0:39:29,126 --> 0:39:32,246
And the World's biggest, driest,


514
0:39:32,246 --> 0:39:46,806
most impassable desert briefly blossoms.


515
0:39:46,806 --> 0:39:49,527
For just a few thousand years,


516
0:39:49,527 --> 0:39:54,407
the Sahara, Sinai and Arabian deserts


517
0:39:54,407 --> 0:39:59,967
were lush and green.


518
0:39:59,967 --> 0:40:4,86
So it looks like, 125,000 years ago,


519
0:40:4,86 --> 0:40:7,327
it Would have been possible for our ancestors to have Walked


520
0:40:7,327 --> 0:40:14,686
through the Sahara and leave Africa to the northeast.


521
0:40:14,686 --> 0:40:18,967
I'm after some evidence that at least one band of pioneers


522
0:40:18,967 --> 0:40:22,447
made it to the other side of the Sahara,


523
0:40:22,447 --> 0:40:31,606
and through that northern exit to the rest of the world.


524
0:40:31,606 --> 0:40:40,726
I'm on my way to Israel and the site of an intriguing discovery.


525
0:40:40,726 --> 0:40:48,806
But one which may present as many questions as answers.


526
0:40:48,806 --> 0:40:53,407
Back in the 1930s, an international team of archaeologists


527
0:40:53,407 --> 0:41:1,646
was excavating here at Skhul Cave.


528
0:41:1,646 --> 0:41:5,766
But it's What Was found outside the cave that Was really interesting.


529
0:41:5,766 --> 0:41:10,567
The archaeologists dug doWn through one and half metres of soil just here,


530
0:41:10,567 --> 0:41:14,927
finding masses and masses of stone tools.


531
0:41:14,927 --> 0:41:17,407
But as they got doWn close to the bedrock,


532
0:41:17,407 --> 0:41:20,606
they found something even more exciting -


533
0:41:20,606 --> 0:41:31,766
human burials, 10 of them.


534
0:41:31,766 --> 0:41:38,206
When the bones were dated, they were found to be about 100,000 years old,


535
0:41:38,206 --> 0:41:48,447
the oldest modern human remains outside Africa.


536
0:41:48,447 --> 0:41:54,487
The dates fit well with that greening of the Sahara.


537
0:41:54,487 --> 0:41:58,967
So could these people be the pioneers I'm looking for,


538
0:41:58,967 --> 0:42:8,806
whose descendants went on to populate the rest of the world?


539
0:42:8,806 --> 0:42:19,686
Some of their remains are now kept in the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem.


540
0:42:19,686 --> 0:42:23,286
This skeleton is incredibly Well-preserved.


541
0:42:23,286 --> 0:42:26,766
And the main reason for that is that the bodies at Skhul


542
0:42:26,766 --> 0:42:29,527
Weren't just left on the surface of the ground.


543
0:42:29,527 --> 0:42:32,447
They Were deliberately buried.


544
0:42:32,447 --> 0:42:35,686
And not only that, they Were buried With objects,


545
0:42:35,686 --> 0:42:38,766
With shell beads, and one of them


546
0:42:38,766 --> 0:42:43,327
even had a boar's jaW enclosed in its arms.


547
0:42:43,327 --> 0:42:49,766
Surely this is further evidence for modern Ways of thinking and behaving,


548
0:42:49,766 --> 0:42:51,887
for spirituality,


549
0:42:51,887 --> 0:43:5,887
and perhaps even a belief in the afterlife.


550
0:43:5,887 --> 0:43:10,286
But not everything here is what it seems.


551
0:43:10,286 --> 0:43:13,967
These people may well have been the first to leave Africa,


552
0:43:13,967 --> 0:43:18,686
but it looks like they can't be our ancestors.


553
0:43:18,686 --> 0:43:21,487
Because the trail then dries up.


554
0:43:21,487 --> 0:43:27,47
All evidence of modern humans disappears.


555
0:43:27,47 --> 0:43:34,927
It looks like these families died out completely...


556
0:43:34,927 --> 0:43:37,606
around 90,000 years ago,


557
0:43:37,606 --> 0:43:41,447
when the Middle East and Sahara returned to desert


558
0:43:41,447 --> 0:43:56,847
and life here became impossible.


559
0:43:56,847 --> 0:44:1,487
For our species, it seems that this Was a dead end.


560
0:44:1,487 --> 0:44:5,646
And it shoWs just hoW fragile our existence Was,


561
0:44:5,646 --> 0:44:11,367
and What a massive impact climate change could have on a human population.


562
0:44:11,367 --> 0:44:14,527
But it Wasn't the end of the human journey.


563
0:44:14,527 --> 0:44:22,206
So Where Was that elusive route out of Africa?


564
0:44:22,206 --> 0:44:27,646
The Sahara Desert once again closed the door on any migration north,


565
0:44:27,646 --> 0:44:33,806
leaving just one of my four routes out of Africa, the Red Sea.


566
0:44:33,806 --> 0:44:38,847
If they did try to cross it, the most likely point is at its mouth,


567
0:44:38,847 --> 0:44:51,246
the gate of grief.


568
0:44:51,246 --> 0:44:58,927
Could at least a few families have broken out of Africa here?


569
0:44:58,927 --> 0:45:0,686
BeloW me is the Red Sea,


570
0:45:0,686 --> 0:45:4,887
and to the West, the small African state of Djibouti.


571
0:45:4,887 --> 0:45:8,367
And over to my east, I can just about make out the coast of Yemen


572
0:45:8,367 --> 0:45:11,86
on the tip of the Arabian peninsula.


573
0:45:11,86 --> 0:45:21,206
At this point, it is just 30 kilometres betWeen Africa and Arabia.


574
0:45:21,206 --> 0:45:24,847
30 kilometres of sea is still a big problem


575
0:45:24,847 --> 0:45:28,967
if you don't have a seagoing vessel.


576
0:45:28,967 --> 0:45:36,847
But from about 90,000 years ago, something interesting began to happen.


577
0:45:36,847 --> 0:45:41,606
The very same climate change that had turned the Sahara back to desert


578
0:45:41,606 --> 0:45:43,927
had another impact.


579
0:45:43,927 --> 0:45:49,246
It made sea levels drop.


580
0:45:49,246 --> 0:45:55,7
And at the gate of grief, the gap between Africa and Arabia


581
0:45:55,7 --> 0:46:0,286
became much smaller.


582
0:46:0,286 --> 0:46:5,47
As sea levels fell, the distance across the Red Sea at this point


583
0:46:5,47 --> 0:46:7,927
dropped to just 1 1 kilometres.


584
0:46:7,927 --> 0:46:13,47
So perhaps, here at last, Was a chance to risk everything,


585
0:46:13,47 --> 0:46:22,726
to cross the Gate of Grief and take a step into the unknoWn.


586
0:46:22,726 --> 0:46:27,246
And geneticists working for this series have been able to estimate


587
0:46:27,246 --> 0:46:31,407
how many people made that leap out of Africa,


588
0:46:31,407 --> 0:46:38,567
whichever way they took.


589
0:46:38,567 --> 0:46:41,527
They estimate the size of this group that made the crossing


590
0:46:41,527 --> 0:46:46,646
from Africa to Arabia Was just a feW hundred people.


591
0:46:46,646 --> 0:46:48,567
And geneticists have noW tested the DNA


592
0:46:48,567 --> 0:46:52,806
of thousands and thousands of non-Africans,


593
0:46:52,806 --> 0:46:59,86
and not one single person has been found Who can't trace their ancestry back


594
0:46:59,86 --> 0:47:5,887
to this tiny group of Wanderers.


595
0:47:5,887 --> 0:47:12,487
It may have been just a single tribe.


596
0:47:12,487 --> 0:47:16,646
And whatever you look like, if you're not African,


597
0:47:16,646 --> 0:47:27,567
you descend from them.


598
0:47:27,567 --> 0:47:37,646
But getting beyond the Red Sea may have been the easy bit.


599
0:47:37,646 --> 0:47:45,367
I'm leaving Africa to travel deep into Arabia.


600
0:47:45,367 --> 0:47:56,967
And here I'm confronted by another great mystery.


601
0:47:56,967 --> 0:48:5,447
How could those pioneers have survived here?


602
0:48:5,447 --> 0:48:9,686
Back then, most of Arabia was brutal desert,


603
0:48:9,686 --> 0:48:16,367
pretty much as it is today.


604
0:48:16,367 --> 0:48:20,86
Is it really possible that a handful of Stone Age people


605
0:48:20,86 --> 0:48:23,766
could have trekked through hundreds of miles of this


606
0:48:23,766 --> 0:48:33,686
and gone on to populate the whole world?


607
0:48:33,686 --> 0:48:36,206
Well, here's one man who looks like he knows


608
0:48:36,206 --> 0:48:42,927
how to get around in the desert.


609
0:48:42,927 --> 0:48:48,86
Archaeologist Jeff Rose has spent years scouring Arabia for evidence


610
0:48:48,86 --> 0:48:59,407
of our earliest ancestors.


611
0:48:59,407 --> 0:49:5,606
And he's come to meet me in Oman.


612
0:49:5,606 --> 0:49:7,126
-Jeff. -Hello.


613
0:49:7,126 --> 0:49:9,206
Hello, hoW are you?


614
0:49:9,206 --> 0:49:11,766
So, Jeff, Why are We in this desolate place?


615
0:49:11,766 --> 0:49:13,726
It's actually quite a special location.


616
0:49:13,726 --> 0:49:15,527
If you look round, you see all these black rocks


617
0:49:15,527 --> 0:49:17,327
that are lying across the surface.


618
0:49:17,327 --> 0:49:20,927
Yeah, there's a particular concentration of them just round here.


619
0:49:20,927 --> 0:49:22,166
Well, they're not really rocks.


620
0:49:22,166 --> 0:49:25,206
They're all ancient stone tools made by early humans.


621
0:49:25,206 --> 0:49:28,126
So, for instance, We just pick this piece up here,


622
0:49:28,126 --> 0:49:29,407
it's got this flat surface


623
0:49:29,407 --> 0:49:32,7
and this surface With flake scars, they're called, on it.


624
0:49:32,7 --> 0:49:34,527
And then they've done some retouch on it.


625
0:49:34,527 --> 0:49:36,367
They've hit it here, and they've hit it here,


626
0:49:36,367 --> 0:49:38,487
to create this chisel-like edge.


627
0:49:38,487 --> 0:49:40,166
So that can't have occurred naturally?


628
0:49:40,166 --> 0:49:41,606
No. This couldn't have occurred naturally


629
0:49:41,606 --> 0:49:43,726
because of the pattern of scars that We see on here.


630
0:49:43,726 --> 0:49:45,246
It's called a burin.


631
0:49:45,246 --> 0:49:48,86
And it Would have been used for Working soft materials,


632
0:49:48,86 --> 0:49:51,646
hides, leather, bone, Wood, anything like that,


633
0:49:51,646 --> 0:49:53,967
for carving tools out of that.


634
0:49:53,967 --> 0:49:55,766
-So it's a little bit like a chisel. -Yeah.


635
0:49:55,766 --> 0:49:58,86
That's just amazing, to pick up a stone tool like that


636
0:49:58,86 --> 0:49:59,206
just lying on the surface.


637
0:49:59,206 --> 0:50:1,327
You get used to it Working in Arabia, 'cause they're everyWhere.


638
0:50:1,327 --> 0:50:2,407
Really?


639
0:50:2,407 --> 0:50:4,567
It's just covering the surface everyWhere you look.


640
0:50:4,567 --> 0:50:6,126
So you reckon most of these,


641
0:50:6,126 --> 0:50:7,686
if they've got sort of flat surfaces on...


642
0:50:7,686 --> 0:50:10,86
Yeah, just about anything you see that's flat lying...


643
0:50:10,86 --> 0:50:11,166
Even things like that?


644
0:50:11,166 --> 0:50:13,7
That's a blade. And that's from the edge of the blade,


645
0:50:13,7 --> 0:50:16,367
-so that's called a cortex. -Yeah.


646
0:50:16,367 --> 0:50:19,86
And a lot of times, they leave that cortex on


647
0:50:19,86 --> 0:50:21,327
because if you're using it, you're not going to cut yourself.


648
0:50:21,327 --> 0:50:24,47
So you can even see almost hoW they Would've held it, something like that.


649
0:50:24,47 --> 0:50:26,407
-That makes a neat little knife. -Exactly.


650
0:50:26,407 --> 0:50:30,686
Okay, so What is the date of this site? Putting you on the spot here, I knoW.


651
0:50:30,686 --> 0:50:33,246
Well, it's hard to say. It's a surface site,


652
0:50:33,246 --> 0:50:35,967
so it's impossible to date anything specifically,


653
0:50:35,967 --> 0:50:38,567
but from that technology, from that core I shoWed you,


654
0:50:38,567 --> 0:50:42,206
We can say it's anyWhere betWeen 70,000 and 12,000 years ago,


655
0:50:42,206 --> 0:50:45,487
-and maybe even earlier. -As long ago as 70,000 years?


656
0:50:45,487 --> 0:50:48,407
There Was a site that Was recently found on the Red Sea coast in Yemen


657
0:50:48,407 --> 0:50:50,407
that Was dated to about 70,000 years ago,


658
0:50:50,407 --> 0:51:0,527
and it's the same technology.


659
0:51:0,527 --> 0:51:5,806
So there Were people here 70,000 years ago.


660
0:51:5,806 --> 0:51:8,246
And I find that really difficult to believe,


661
0:51:8,246 --> 0:51:11,967
because at that time the landscape Would have been


662
0:51:11,967 --> 0:51:15,766
just as dry and harsh as it is today.


663
0:51:15,766 --> 0:51:20,47
I mean, okay, there's stone to make tools out of.


664
0:51:20,47 --> 0:51:37,327
But Where Were they living?


665
0:51:37,327 --> 0:51:40,847
The biggest problem for those pioneering families


666
0:51:40,847 --> 0:51:45,686
would have been the lack of water.


667
0:51:45,686 --> 0:51:49,766
But a few short miles from these arid mountains


668
0:51:49,766 --> 0:52:13,126
I'm in for a surprise.


669
0:52:13,126 --> 0:52:14,927
Well, just look at this.


670
0:52:14,927 --> 0:52:17,246
I'm only tWo miles aWay from the desert here,


671
0:52:17,246 --> 0:52:20,606
but I could be in rural Somerset -


672
0:52:20,606 --> 0:52:24,246
if it Weren't for the camels.


673
0:52:24,246 --> 0:52:37,927
Definitely in Arabia.


674
0:52:37,927 --> 0:52:40,646
This place near the coast of Oman


675
0:52:40,646 --> 0:52:49,407
sits right on the edge of the monsoon region of the Indian Ocean.


676
0:52:49,407 --> 0:52:57,7
Every year, the monsoons turn this valley into a green oasis,


677
0:52:57,7 --> 0:53:5,646
somewhere you can imagine our ancestors flourishing.


678
0:53:5,646 --> 0:53:10,527
But this is a green island in the middle of the desert.


679
0:53:10,527 --> 0:53:15,847
The desert stretches on for hundreds of miles around here.


680
0:53:15,847 --> 0:53:21,726
So hoW did our ancestors move through Arabia


681
0:53:21,726 --> 0:53:30,7
to reach the World beyond?


682
0:53:30,7 --> 0:53:32,47
There's no way they could have done it


683
0:53:32,47 --> 0:53:40,967
without more widespread sources of fresh water.


684
0:53:40,967 --> 0:54:5,567
But where are they?


685
0:54:5,567 --> 0:54:8,126
I'm at sea, just off the coast of Oman,


686
0:54:8,126 --> 0:54:11,567
a coastline that our ancestors may have passed along -


687
0:54:11,567 --> 0:54:15,447
except that 70,000 years ago the coast Wouldn't have been there


688
0:54:15,447 --> 0:54:18,246
because the sea level Was much loWer.


689
0:54:18,246 --> 0:54:28,847
It Was up to 50 kilometres in that direction.


690
0:54:28,847 --> 0:54:32,887
And Jeff Rose thinks that the key to our ancestors'journey


691
0:54:32,887 --> 0:54:38,246
along this coast lies at the bottom of the sea.


692
0:54:38,246 --> 0:54:41,726
One of the strangest things about Arabia is We have this dry surface,


693
0:54:41,726 --> 0:54:44,487
this completely arid landscape, and yet beneath the surface


694
0:54:44,487 --> 0:54:47,606
there are heaps of fresh Water that's bubbling toWard the coast,


695
0:54:47,606 --> 0:54:50,606
running toWard the coast, and coming up directly beneath us.


696
0:54:50,606 --> 0:54:53,7
So right doWn beloW, if you Were to dive doWn With a canteen,


697
0:54:53,7 --> 0:54:55,47
you could fill it up With fresh Water and have a drink.


698
0:54:55,47 --> 0:54:57,166
So the springs doWn there are still Working today?


699
0:54:57,166 --> 0:55:0,407
Still Working today. There are heaps of fresh Water coming toWard the coast.


700
0:55:0,407 --> 0:55:3,206
Only When the sea level Was loWer Would it have been available,


701
0:55:3,206 --> 0:55:6,126
so it really shoWs Why that coastline Was so important


702
0:55:6,126 --> 0:55:15,927
for the early humans moving out of Africa.


703
0:55:15,927 --> 0:55:18,887
ROBERTS: So, around 70,000 years ago,


704
0:55:18,887 --> 0:55:27,967
the Arabian coastline was very different to today.


705
0:55:27,967 --> 0:55:32,606
Freshwater springs bubbled up all the way along it.


706
0:55:32,606 --> 0:55:39,686
If our ancestors attempted this route, they would have found a lifeline


707
0:55:39,686 --> 0:55:46,847
stretching all the way from the Red Sea to the Persian gulf...


708
0:55:46,847 --> 0:55:57,367
a place which back then was a great fertile plain.


709
0:55:57,367 --> 0:55:59,407
So the Gulf as We knoW it today didn't exist.


710
0:55:59,407 --> 0:56:2,606
It Was a vast, green, lush plain.


711
0:56:2,606 --> 0:56:6,166
Green and lush, you had estuaries and rivers and lakes.


712
0:56:6,166 --> 0:56:8,726
It Was probably the most important place


713
0:56:8,726 --> 0:56:11,286
in southWest Asia for all of early humans


714
0:56:11,286 --> 0:56:14,166
because of so much fresh Water that Was available at that time.


715
0:56:14,166 --> 0:56:16,367
So they had everything they needed for survival.


716
0:56:16,367 --> 0:56:23,246
-Well, it sounds idyllic. -It Was.


717
0:56:23,246 --> 0:56:26,847
ROBERTS: Finding the route that our ancestors took out of Africa


718
0:56:26,847 --> 0:56:29,7
has been challenging.


719
0:56:29,7 --> 0:56:36,286
But I really think that this could have been it.


720
0:56:36,286 --> 0:56:40,806
And it's perhaps no wonder, with the obstacles they faced,


721
0:56:40,806 --> 0:56:46,726
that there seems to have been just one successful attempt,


722
0:56:46,726 --> 0:56:55,927
a massive leap in our ancestors'journey.


723
0:56:55,927 --> 0:56:59,567
Africa Was the original home of our species,


724
0:56:59,567 --> 0:57:4,47
and it Was our only home for tens of thousands of years


725
0:57:4,47 --> 0:57:9,487
until a small handful of people made their Way out of Africa.


726
0:57:9,487 --> 0:57:15,686
And it Was their descendants that Went on to colonise the rest of the World.


727
0:57:15,686 --> 0:57:18,367
I'm going to try to trace their footsteps


728
0:57:18,367 --> 0:57:28,286
as We continue on the great human journey.


729
0:57:28,286 --> 0:57:31,927
Come with me as I travel right across the world...


730
0:57:31,927 --> 0:57:34,367
This is looking like a pretty big footprint.


731
0:57:34,367 --> 0:57:39,327
...in search of the traces left by our ancestors.


732
0:57:39,327 --> 0:57:41,327
-That's the original? -Yeah, original.


733
0:57:41,327 --> 0:57:45,487
I didn't knoW any of it had survived.


734
0:57:45,487 --> 0:57:51,927
I want to know how so few people could have populated the rest of the planet...


735
0:57:51,927 --> 0:57:58,726
That makes us rethink all of our theories about early Americans.


736
0:57:58,726 --> 0:58:3,206
...facing the unimaginable,


737
0:58:3,206 --> 0:58:8,606
rival species and even near extinction...


738
0:58:8,606 --> 0:58:13,286

0:58:20,527 --> 0:58:24,7

742

And how did those journeys change us into who we are today?
