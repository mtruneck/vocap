ADRI MURGUIA: Hey,
this is Adri.


4
0:0:19,67 --> 0:0:22,25
And we're here in Santa Clarita
Valley to meet up with


5
0:0:22,25 --> 0:0:25,47
Jamie Nudie, who is Nudie
Cohn's granddaughter.


6
0:0:25,47 --> 0:0:27,335
And she is carrying
on his legacy.


7
0:0:27,335 --> 0:0:29,87
Let's go find out what
this is about.


8
0:0:29,87 --> 0:0:30,37
Hi.


9
0:0:30,37 --> 0:0:31,63
How are you?


10
0:0:31,63 --> 0:0:31,92
JAMIE NUDIE: I'm great.


11
0:0:31,92 --> 0:0:32,369
How are you?


12
0:0:32,369 --> 0:0:32,782
ADRI MURGUIA: Good.


13
0:0:32,782 --> 0:0:33,61
I'm Adri.


14
0:0:33,61 --> 0:0:34,36
JAMIE NUDIE: Nice to meet you.


15
0:0:34,36 --> 0:0:34,915
I'm Jamie.


16
0:0:34,915 --> 0:0:36,165
Please come in.


17
0:0:36,165 --> 0:0:42,65



18
0:0:42,65 --> 0:0:44,415
My grandfather was Nudie.


19
0:0:44,415 --> 0:0:46,145
He went by one name only.


20
0:0:46,145 --> 0:0:49,91
He immigrated here from Kiev,
Russia at age 11.


21
0:0:49,91 --> 0:0:51,17
He settled in New York.


22
0:0:51,17 --> 0:0:53,28
He first started making
g-strings for all the


23
0:0:53,28 --> 0:0:58,68
showgirls, and just had
a flair for it.


24
0:0:58,68 --> 0:1:1,9
And he traveled to Mankato,
Minnesota, where he met my


25
0:1:1,9 --> 0:1:2,81
grandmother.


26
0:1:2,81 --> 0:1:6,1
They fell in love, and finally
settled in Hollywood.


27
0:1:6,1 --> 0:1:8,69
He loved old Western film.


28
0:1:8,69 --> 0:1:11,35
And he'd sit there, and he
thought, gosh, they sort of


29
0:1:11,35 --> 0:1:13,67
were missing something
on stage.


30
0:1:13,67 --> 0:1:15,47
And he came up with the
idea of putting


31
0:1:15,47 --> 0:1:16,9
rhinestones on clothing.


32
0:1:16,9 --> 0:1:19,66
He first approached
Lefty Frizzell.


33
0:1:19,66 --> 0:1:22,45
And he said, Lefty, if you've
got the guts to wear a shirt


34
0:1:22,45 --> 0:1:25,49
of mine, I'll make it for
you, free of charge.


35
0:1:25,49 --> 0:1:28,59
If it takes off, you'll
start to pay me.


36
0:1:28,59 --> 0:1:31,67
Lefty got up on stage,
and it was a hit.


37
0:1:31,67 --> 0:1:35,5
They got a storefront on Victory
and Vineland in the


38
0:1:35,5 --> 0:1:39,81
early '60s, and approached Roy
and Dale when Roy was working


39
0:1:39,81 --> 0:1:41,67
for Republic Studios.


40
0:1:41,67 --> 0:1:44,59
And Roy had said to him, I've
heard about you around town.


41
0:1:44,59 --> 0:1:46,57
And sure I'll let you
do some work for me.


42
0:1:46,57 --> 0:1:50,24
But I want the kid in the
nosebleed section to be able


43
0:1:50,24 --> 0:1:50,86
to see me.


44
0:1:50,86 --> 0:1:54,86
-It's the king of the
cowboys, Roy Rogers.


45
0:1:54,86 --> 0:1:55,472
And here he is.


46
0:1:55,472 --> 0:1:58,71



47
0:1:58,71 --> 0:2:1,3
JAMIE NUDIE: So my grandfather
made shirts


48
0:2:1,3 --> 0:2:3,1
for Roy with fringe.


49
0:2:3,1 --> 0:2:7,47
And on every piece of fringe
was a rhinestone.


50
0:2:7,47 --> 0:2:10,6
And when Roy got up on stage,
that kid in the nosebleed


51
0:2:10,6 --> 0:2:11,25
section saw Roy.


52
0:2:11,25 --> 0:2:14,32
The lights hit the fringe
and the fringe danced.


53
0:2:14,32 --> 0:2:16,53
And it would sway
back and forth.


54
0:2:16,53 --> 0:2:18,25
From there it just took off.


55
0:2:18,25 --> 0:2:21,98
Everybody had heard of Nudie,
and wanted to come into his


56
0:2:21,98 --> 0:2:24,71
business, and have him
make suits for him.


57
0:2:24,71 --> 0:2:29,8
This is a vintage that was done
for "Rodeo Queen." And


58
0:2:29,8 --> 0:2:33,29
you can see, who's got
a waist that small?


59
0:2:33,29 --> 0:2:34,92
ADRI MURGUIA: Where did he
get all the rhinestones?


60
0:2:34,92 --> 0:2:36,14
JAMIE NUDIE: The rhinestones
were actually


61
0:2:36,14 --> 0:2:37,5
shipped in from New York.


62
0:2:37,5 --> 0:2:37,33
ADRI MURGUIA: Really?


63
0:2:37,33 --> 0:2:38,53
JAMIE NUDIE: Yeah.


64
0:2:38,53 --> 0:2:42,3
This was done for an
Elvis impersonator.


65
0:2:42,3 --> 0:2:43,31
ADRI MURGUIA: This is
like a replica?


66
0:2:43,31 --> 0:2:45,28
JAMIE NUDIE: It's
a replica, yes.


67
0:2:45,28 --> 0:2:46,33
ADRI MURGUIA: This
is so crazy.


68
0:2:46,33 --> 0:2:49,41
JAMIE NUDIE: Love
the gold lame.


69
0:2:49,41 --> 0:2:51,65
ADRI MURGUIA: Where's
the original?


70
0:2:51,65 --> 0:2:52,55
JAMIE NUDIE: The original
is in Graceland.


71
0:2:52,55 --> 0:2:54,1
ADRI MURGUIA: Oh, right.


72
0:2:54,1 --> 0:2:56,19
JAMIE NUDIE: Colonel gave
it to the museum.


73
0:2:56,19 --> 0:2:59,25
And that's where the
original's at.


74
0:2:59,25 --> 0:3:0,4
Here's a photograph.


75
0:3:0,4 --> 0:3:4,48
This was probably in the
early '50s, Oh, '57.


76
0:3:4,48 --> 0:3:7,97
Here's Colonel here, and
Elvis, and Nudie.


77
0:3:7,97 --> 0:3:10,43
Nearly and Colonel Parker
were great friends.


78
0:3:10,43 --> 0:3:14,3
Colonel Parker had been manager
for other artists, and


79
0:3:14,3 --> 0:3:17,1
Colonel had come to Nudie
and said, I'm


80
0:3:17,1 --> 0:3:19,2
taking on this new act.


81
0:3:19,2 --> 0:3:22,2
He said, I want you to make
something for him that's out


82
0:3:22,2 --> 0:3:24,96
of this world spectacular.


83
0:3:24,96 --> 0:3:29,11
In 1957, the gold lame suit
for Elvis was born.


84
0:3:29,11 --> 0:3:32,19
And, as a matter fact, my
mother was a young girl.


85
0:3:32,19 --> 0:3:35,11
And Colonel and Nudie got
together and surprised my


86
0:3:35,11 --> 0:3:38,24
mother on her 18th birthday,
having Elvis sing.


87
0:3:38,24 --> 0:3:39,79
They went on a date.


88
0:3:39,79 --> 0:3:42,89
The gold lame suit
was a huge hit.


89
0:3:42,89 --> 0:3:47,66
Here is Nudie on the cover of
"Rolling Stone" in 1969, the


90
0:3:47,66 --> 0:3:52,5
same year that John and
Yoko are in bed again.


91
0:3:52,5 --> 0:3:53,98
I mean, who makes the cover
of "Rolling Stone"?


92
0:3:53,98 --> 0:3:58,6
He was an immigrant from Kiev,
Russia, and he makes the cover


93
0:3:58,6 --> 0:3:59,65
of "Rolling Stone" in '69.


94
0:3:59,65 --> 0:4:0,18
That's crazy.


95
0:4:0,18 --> 0:4:1,95
ADRI MURGUIA: He looks
so badass.


96
0:4:1,95 --> 0:4:4,0
JAMIE NUDIE: Yeah.


97
0:4:4,0 --> 0:4:7,1
Not only did Nudie make
a lot of the clothes.


98
0:4:7,1 --> 0:4:11,72
But through the 50 years of
business, he made 18 cars.


99
0:4:11,72 --> 0:4:15,15
He thought he needed
a calling card.


100
0:4:15,15 --> 0:4:16,4
ADRI MURGUIA: Oh my god.


101
0:4:16,4 --> 0:4:23,55



102
0:4:23,55 --> 0:4:25,42
I mean, it's like in perfect--


103
0:4:25,42 --> 0:4:26,57
JAMIE NUDIE: It's in
perfect condition.


104
0:4:26,57 --> 0:4:28,78
It has under 30,000
miles on it.


105
0:4:28,78 --> 0:4:31,53
ADRI MURGUIA: I have four
guns right here.


106
0:4:31,53 --> 0:4:32,78
Just here I have four guns.


107
0:4:32,78 --> 0:4:35,456



108
0:4:35,456 --> 0:4:36,63
And you take this out?


109
0:4:36,63 --> 0:4:38,49
JAMIE NUDIE: Yeah.


110
0:4:38,49 --> 0:4:41,35
He started with a 1950 Hudson,
and went on to Pontiac


111
0:4:41,35 --> 0:4:42,11
Bonnevilles.


112
0:4:42,11 --> 0:4:45,66
And not too many people had
white cars back in those days.


113
0:4:45,66 --> 0:4:49,79
And so he was kind of like the
first to set the market and


114
0:4:49,79 --> 0:4:54,1
have a white car, but then put
steerhorns and guns and silver


115
0:4:54,1 --> 0:4:55,11
dollars on it.


116
0:4:55,11 --> 0:4:58,79
And some cars had embroidered
seats.


117
0:4:58,79 --> 0:5:0,4
We called them the horny cars.


118
0:5:0,4 --> 0:5:2,63



119
0:5:2,63 --> 0:5:5,88
In the '70s and in the '80s,
all the rock groups started


120
0:5:5,88 --> 0:5:6,44
wearing them.


121
0:5:6,44 --> 0:5:7,82
It wasn't just Western film.


122
0:5:7,82 --> 0:5:13,84
It was Chicago, America, ZZ
Top, Bootsy Collins, Teddy


123
0:5:13,84 --> 0:5:18,391
Pendergrass, a lot of rock
groups and stuff that he had


124
0:5:18,391 --> 0:5:19,63
done it for.


125
0:5:19,63 --> 0:5:23,99
It was something that was
unique, one of a kind,


126
0:5:23,99 --> 0:5:27,56
eccentric, very out
of this world.


127
0:5:27,56 --> 0:5:30,46
For example, in the '70s, the
Flying Burrito Brothers, Gram


128
0:5:30,46 --> 0:5:34,92
Parsons, him and Nudie were
more like father son.


129
0:5:34,92 --> 0:5:36,19
And he looked up to my


130
0:5:36,19 --> 0:5:39,2
grandfather as a father figure.


131
0:5:39,2 --> 0:5:40,865
Here's the Flying Burrito
Brothers.


132
0:5:40,865 --> 0:5:45,26
There's Gram Parsons with the
famous pill, marijuana suit.


133
0:5:45,26 --> 0:5:49,29
Here's a replica of
Gram Parsons's.

see the back.

ADRI MURGUIA: Love that.


137
0:5:54,968 --> 0:5:57,5



138
0:5:57,5 --> 0:5:57,825
Do you ever wear this?


139
0:5:57,825 --> 0:5:58,75

145

to bring it back, like


146
0:6:11,443 --> 0:6:12,1

And you can do anything if
you set your mind to it.

If you have the drive,
and you have the


157
0:6:32,39 --> 0:6:34,5
ambition, you can do that.


158
0:6:34,5 --> 0:6:37,88
And that's what I feel as
though I'm here for, to


159
0:6:37,88 --> 0:6:40,56
further educate younger
generations, let them know


160
0:6:40,56 --> 0:6:42,69
that you can do something
like this.


161
0:6:42,69 --> 0:6:46,14
And have an idea, and
let it sparkle.


162
0:6:46,14 --> 0:6:47,34
Put a rhinestone on it.
