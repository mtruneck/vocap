1
0:0:0,49 --> 0:0:4,9
PROFESSOR: WELCOME BACK. AND I THINK THAT
STARTING OUT TODAY


2
0:0:4,9 --> 0:0:10,84
WE SHOULD PROBABLY DECIDE ON A REVIEW SESSION.
OKAY, SO HOW MANY


3
0:0:10,84 --> 0:0:13,83
PEOPLE, WE HAVE TO DO IT THIS WEEK BECAUSE
UNFORTUNATELY NEXT


4
0:0:13,83 --> 0:0:17,9
WEEK THE ROOM'S NOT AVAILABLE. AND SO HOW
MANY PEOPLE WOULD


5
0:0:17,9 --> 0:0:21,65
LIKE TO DO IT ON WEDNESDAY AT THIS TIME?


6
0:0:21,65 --> 0:0:25,749
STUDENT: WE CAN'T HEAR YOU BACK HERE.


7
0:0:25,749 --> 0:0:30,859
PROFESSOR: OH, OKAY. SO WE NEED TO HOLD A
REVIEW SESSION OR I'D


8
0:0:30,859 --> 0:0:35,59
LIKE TO, IT'S NOT OBLIGATORY, BUT IT WOULD
BE NICE TO HOLD A


9
0:0:35,59 --> 0:0:38,32
REVIEW SESSION. AND IF WE DID IT ON, WE HAVE
TO DO IT EITHER


10
0:0:38,32 --> 0:0:42,66
WEDNESDAY OR FRIDAY OF THIS WEEK. SO HOW MANY
FOR WEDNESDAY


11
0:0:42,66 --> 0:0:48,91
AGAIN? OKAY, HOW ABOUT FRIDAY? IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S WEDNESDAY


12
0:0:48,91 --> 0:0:52,59
THEN. SO WE'LL MEET HERE ON WEDNESDAY. AND
I'LL CONTINUE TO


13
0:0:52,59 --> 0:0:56,8
HOLD OFFICE HOURS UP TO THE DAY OF THE FINAL.
BUT NEXT WEEK


14
0:0:56,8 --> 0:1:0,879
I'LL PROBABLY BE IN, I'LL ARRIVE AT THE OFFICE
AND IF NOBODY


15
0:1:0,879 --> 0:1:4,66
SHOWS UP WITHIN ABOUT, BY ABOUT 20 AFTER,
I'M PROBABLY GOING TO


16
0:1:4,66 --> 0:1:7,98
LEAVE BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE
WILL EVEN BE ON CAMPUS


17
0:1:7,98 --> 0:1:11,73
NEXT WEEK. BUT, SO BE SURE IF YOU COME TO
OFFICE HOUR NEXT WEEK


18
0:1:11,73 --> 0:1:15,18
THAT YOU SHOW UP WITHIN THE FIRST 10 MINUTES,
LIKE BETWEEN 10


19
0:1:15,18 --> 0:1:19,25
AFTER AND 20 AFTER. AND THE SAME GOES FOR
THE DAY OF THE FINAL.


20
0:1:19,25 --> 0:1:26,24
ALL RIGHT, SO LAST TIME I GAVE YOU A BIT OF
AN INTRODUCTION TO


21
0:1:26,24 --> 0:1:32,81
THE WHOLE TOPIC OF SIGNALING IN PLANTS, HOW
PLANTS CAN ACTUALLY


22
0:1:32,81 --> 0:1:38,6
PERCEIVE STIMULI. WE TALKED ABOUT THE STIMULUS
OF LIGHT AND


23
0:1:38,6 --> 0:1:41,56
PHOTOPERIODISM IN PARTICULAR, THAT IS PHYSIOLOGICAL
RESPONSES OF


24
0:1:41,56 --> 0:1:45,92
PLANTS TO THE RELATIVE LENGTH OF LIGHT AND
DARKNESS WHICH IS


25
0:1:45,92 --> 0:1:45,92



26
0:1:45,92 --> 0:1:49,22
IMPORTANT WITH REGARD TO FLOWERING IN PARTICULAR
IS ONE OF THE,


27
0:1:49,22 --> 0:1:53,36
THE THING WE MAINLY FOCUSED ON. I JUST WANT
TO FINISH UP ON


28
0:1:53,36 --> 0:1:58,84
THAT BY POINTING OUT THAT IT'S ACTUALLY NOT
THE, THE LENGTH OF


29
0:1:58,84 --> 0:2:3,32
THE DAY THAT'S IMPORTANT BUT IT'S THE UNINTERRUPTED
LENGTH OF THE


30
0:2:3,32 --> 0:2:8,84
NIGHT THAT PLANTS ARE ACTUALLY PERCEIVING.
AND THIS WAS


31
0:2:8,84 --> 0:2:12,55
ESTABLISHED AFTER THE NAME SHORT-DAY PLANT
AND LONG-DAY PLANT


32
0:2:12,55 --> 0:2:16,44
WERE ALREADY INGRAINED IN THE LITERATURE.
SO THOSE NAMES


33
0:2:16,44 --> 0:2:20,8
PERSIST FOR PLANTS THAT FLOWER DURING SHORT
DAYS AND PLANTS THAT


34
0:2:20,8 --> 0:2:23,38
FLOWER DURING LONG DAYS. AND AS I MENTIONED,
THERE'S SOME


35
0:2:23,38 --> 0:2:26,25
PLANTS THAT ARE DAY, DAY NEUTRAL. THEY JUST
FLOWER WHENEVER


36
0:2:26,25 --> 0:2:30,81
THEY'RE AT THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATE TO FLOWER.
BUT THE


37
0:2:30,81 --> 0:2:35,19
EXPERIMENTS THAT WERE DONE TO DEMONSTRATE
THAT THIS IS A, A


38
0:2:35,19 --> 0:2:37,81
NIGHT-LENGTH RESPONSE RATHER THAN A DAY-LENGTH
RESPONSE WERE


39
0:2:37,81 --> 0:2:41,67
PRETTY ELEGANT. JUST BASICALLY GROWING PLANTS
IN A GREENHOUSE


40
0:2:41,67 --> 0:2:46,93
SITUATION UNDER CONTROLLED LIGHT. AND WITH
A SHORT-DAY PLANT


41
0:2:46,93 --> 0:2:51,67
WHICH WOULD NORMALLY FLOWER AFTER THE NIGHT
OR AFTER THE DAY


42
0:2:51,67 --> 0:2:56,93
LENGTH WENT BELOW A CERTAIN LEVEL IN THE FALL
OR THE LATE SUMMER,


43
0:2:56,93 --> 0:3:0,569
A BRIEF FLASH OF LIGHT WAS INTRODUCED ABOUT
MIDWAY THROUGH THE


44
0:3:0,569 --> 0:3:6,56
DARK PERIOD AND THOSE PLANTS THEN WOULD, WOULD
FLOWER. SO AND


45
0:3:6,56 --> 0:3:10,14
THE SAME SORT OF THING WAS OBSERVED WITH THE
LONG-DAY PLANTS


46
0:3:10,14 --> 0:3:14,29
WHICH TYPICALLY WOULD FLOWER WHEN DAY LENGTH
REACHES A CERTAIN


47
0:3:14,29 --> 0:3:18,819
PERIOD OF TIME, THAT FLOWER IN THE LATE SPRING
OR EARLY SUMMER.


48
0:3:18,819 --> 0:3:22,209
AND IT TURNED OUT THAT A BRIEF FLASH OF INTENSE
LIGHT, JUST THE


49
0:3:22,209 --> 0:3:28,15
BRIEFEST FLASH IN BOTH CASES, WOULD INITIATE
FLOWERING EVEN


50
0:3:28,15 --> 0:3:31,15
THOUGH THE DARK PERIOD WAS TOO LONG STILL
FOR FLOWERING TO OCCUR


51
0:3:31,15 --> 0:3:32,99



52
0:3:32,99 --> 0:3:35,79
IN THIS CASE. SO IT APPEARS THAT BASED ON
OTHER WORK THAT


53
0:3:35,79 --> 0:3:38,959
PHYTOCHROME ACTUALLY IS INVOLVED HERE, AT
LEAST IN PART. IT'S


54
0:3:38,959 --> 0:3:43,98
ONE OF THE PHOTORECEPTORS SENSING THE OVERALL
LENGTH OF THE NIGHT


55
0:3:43,98 --> 0:3:48,15
PERIOD. AND WITH THE FLASH OF LIGHT PHYTOCHROME
SIGNALS THE END


56
0:3:48,15 --> 0:3:52,709
OF THAT NIGHT PERIOD. SO WITH THE LONG-DAY
PLANT, WHICH IS


57
0:3:52,709 --> 0:3:56,739
BASICALLY A SHORT NIGHT PLANT, THAT FLASH
OF LIGHT BREAKS UP THAT


58
0:3:56,739 --> 0:4:0,16
LONG DARK PERIOD INTO TWO SHORT PERIODS, AND
THE PLANT SENSES IT


59
0:4:0,16 --> 0:4:5,2
AS A SHORT NIGHT AND FLOWERING IS INITIATED.
AND HERE WHERE THE


60
0:4:5,2 --> 0:4:8,42
FLASH OF LIGHT IS ALSO INTRODUCED IN THE MIDDLE
OF THAT DARK


61
0:4:8,42 --> 0:4:13,84
PERIOD, I ACTUALLY MISSTATED THIS THAT THE,
THE SHORT-DAY PLANT


62
0:4:13,84 --> 0:4:19,849
WILL NOT FLOWER BECAUSE THE LONG NIGHT IS
NOT PERCEIVED.


63
0:4:19,849 --> 0:4:24,669
INSTEAD IT'S PERCEIVED AS A SHORT NIGHT. SO
THESE PLANTS FLOWER


64
0:4:24,669 --> 0:4:28,71
WHEN THE NIGHT LENGTH CROSSES A CRITICAL THRESHOLD,
BUT THE FLASH


65
0:4:28,71 --> 0:4:34,879
OF LIGHT CAUSES THE PLANT NOT TO PERCEIVE
THAT AS A LONG NIGHT.


66
0:4:34,879 --> 0:4:38,309
WHEREAS HERE THE FLASH OF LIGHT SUGGESTS THIS
IS A SHORT NIGHT


67
0:4:38,309 --> 0:4:41,779
WHICH IS WHAT IS REQUIRED FOR LONG-DAY PLANT
TO FLOWER. ARE


68
0:4:41,779 --> 0:4:48,71
THERE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT THEN? SO THIS
IS A, THIS IS ALL I


69
0:4:48,71 --> 0:4:51,52
REALLY HAD TO SAY ABOUT, WELL, THERE'S ONE
MORE THING TO SAY


70
0:4:51,52 --> 0:4:54,77
ABOUT PHOTOPERIODISM, AND IT'S PRETTY INTERESTING.
AND THIS


71
0:4:54,77 --> 0:5:0,379
SEGUES INTO THE NEXT TOPIC ABOUT GROWTH REGULATION.
AND THAT IS


72
0:5:0,379 --> 0:5:4,789
THAT EXPERIMENTS WERE ALSO DONE WHERE A PLANT
THAT WAS IN, WHERE


73
0:5:4,789 --> 0:5:9,909
A FLOWERING HAD BEEN INITIATED, IN THIS CASE
A SHORT-DAY PLANT,


74
0:5:9,909 --> 0:5:14,11
HAD A LONG-DAY PLANT SHOOT GRAFTED ON TO IT,
SO PHYSICALLY


75
0:5:14,11 --> 0:5:18,439
GRAFTED ONTO THE TISSUES OF THIS SHORT-DAY
PLANT. THIS IS A


76
0:5:18,439 --> 0:5:22,19
LONG-DAY PLANT THAT HADN'T FLOWERED AT THE
TIME. AND THIS PLANT


77
0:5:22,19 --> 0:5:22,189



78
0:5:22,189 --> 0:5:27,43
THEN FLOWERED EVEN THOUGH THE DAY LENGTH WASN'T,
WASN'T


79
0:5:27,43 --> 0:5:30,5
APPROPRIATE FOR A LONG-DAY PLANT TO FLOWER
UNDER THOSE


80
0:5:30,5 --> 0:5:33,779
CONDITIONS. SO THIS KIND OF EXPERIMENT CAN
BE DONE THE OTHER


81
0:5:33,779 --> 0:5:38,879
WAY AROUND TOO WITH DRAFTING A SHORT-DAY SHOOT
ONTO A LONG-DAY


82
0:5:38,879 --> 0:5:43,819
PLANT THAT HAD ALREADY INITIATED AND IT WOULD
FLOWER AT A TIME


83
0:5:43,819 --> 0:5:47,89
WHEN IT NORMALLY WOULDN'T. SO CLEARLY SOMETHING
IS BEING


84
0:5:47,89 --> 0:5:53,439
TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE TISSUES OF THIS PLANT
THAT'S UNDERGONE


85
0:5:53,439 --> 0:5:56,819
FLOWERING TO THE TISSUES OF ANOTHER, OF THIS
OTHER PLANT THAT'S


86
0:5:56,819 --> 0:6:1,839
RESULTING IN INITIATION OF FLOWERING. AND
THIS IS, THIS SORT OF


87
0:6:1,839 --> 0:6:7,65
EXPERIMENT DATES LONG AGO, I MEAN FOR NEARLY
THREE QUART-, THREE


88
0:6:7,65 --> 0:6:13,99
QUARTERS OF A CENTURY, PEOPLE HAVE POSTULATED
ON THE BASIS OF


89
0:6:13,99 --> 0:6:17,189
SUCH DATA THAT THERE'S A FLOWERING HORMONE
THAT'S TRANSMITTED


90
0:6:17,189 --> 0:6:21,569
WITHIN PLANTS. THEY'VE EVEN GIVEN IT THE NAME
FLORIGEN BUT NO


91
0:6:21,569 --> 0:6:24,969
ONE HAS EVER SUCCESSFULLY ISOLATED THIS HORMONE,
SO IT'S STILL A


92
0:6:24,969 --> 0:6:29,289
COMPLETE HYPOTHETICAL IF IT REALLY EXISTS.
BUT IT'S STILL CALLED


93
0:6:29,289 --> 0:6:31,96
BY THIS NAME IN THE LITERATURE AND PEOPLE
DISCUSS IT AS IF IT


94
0:6:31,96 --> 0:6:35,3
EXISTS. IT'S ONE OF THE MOST, IT'S ONE OF
THE STRANGER ASPECTS


95
0:6:35,3 --> 0:6:39,249
OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY. AND IT'S POSSIBLE BASED
ON SOME RECENT


96
0:6:39,249 --> 0:6:44,99
EXPERIMENTS IN ARABIDOPSIS WHICH IS A MODEL
SYSTEM FOR STUDYING


97
0:6:44,99 --> 0:6:50,43
PLANT BIOLOGY THAT THE STIMULUS MIGHT NOT
BE A HORMONE BUT MIGHT


98
0:6:50,43 --> 0:6:56,599
BE A MACROMOLECULE, DN, A PROTEIN OR A NUCLEIC
ACID RATHER THAN


99
0:6:56,599 --> 0:7:3,499
A MICROMOLECULE WHICH HORMONES TYPICALLY ARE.
SO THAT GETS TO


100
0:7:3,499 --> 0:7:8,29
THE POINT OF PLANT CHEMISTRY. AND I WANT TO
TALK ABOUT PLANT


101
0:7:8,29 --> 0:7:12,289
CHEMISTRY ONLY IN RELATION TO HOW PLANTS RESPOND
TO ENVIRONMENTAL


102
0:7:12,289 --> 0:7:18,909
STIMULI. AND THIS IS A REALLY FASCINATING
AREA ABOUT WHICH


103
0:7:18,909 --> 0:7:19,629



104
0:7:19,629 --> 0:7:22,5
WE'RE LEARNING MORE ALL THE TIME. HUGE AMOUNTS
HAVE BEEN


105
0:7:22,5 --> 0:7:26,69
LEARNED SINCE I ACTUALLY TOOK BOTANY AND TAUGHT
IT AS A GRADUATE


106
0:7:26,69 --> 0:7:31,169
STUDENT. BUT PLANTS, LIKE ANIMALS, HAVE A
LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS


107
0:7:31,169 --> 0:7:36,36
FOR COPING WITH THE, WITH ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE.
AND,


108
0:7:36,36 --> 0:7:41,499
OF COURSE, MOST ANIMALS CAN MOVE IN RESPONSE
TO EITHER A


109
0:7:41,499 --> 0:7:44,679
FAVORABLE STIMULUS OR AN UNFAVORABLE STIMULUS.
THEY CAN EITHER


110
0:7:44,679 --> 0:7:49,89
APPROACH IT OR RETREAT FROM IT. WHEREAS PLANTS
THROUGH MOST OF


111
0:7:49,89 --> 0:7:53,99
THEIR LIFE CYCLE ARE IMMOBILE AND ARE LOCKED
IN PLACE


112
0:7:53,99 --> 0:7:57,55
ESSENTIALLY, SO THEIR, THEIR RESPONSES REALLY
ARE TYPICALLY IN


113
0:7:57,55 --> 0:8:5,319
THE AREA OF GROWTH OR METABOLIC CHANGES. AND
PLANT HORMONES ARE


114
0:8:5,319 --> 0:8:11,449
ONE OF THE WAYS THAT THE PLANT CAN SIGNAL
THESE, THIS NECESSITY


115
0:8:11,449 --> 0:8:17,27
TO CHANGE, TO UNDERGO SOME KIND OF RESPONSE.
AND THESE ARE


116
0:8:17,27 --> 0:8:20,159
OFTEN CALLED PLANT GROWTH REGULATORS BECAUSE
THEY DIFFER FROM


117
0:8:20,159 --> 0:8:24,339
ANIMAL HORMONES IN SOME WAYS. THEY SOMETIMES
ACT CLOSE TO THE


118
0:8:24,339 --> 0:8:30,39
SOURCE OF PRODUCTION. BUT THEY'RE TYPICALLY
TRANSLOCATED WITHIN


119
0:8:30,39 --> 0:8:34,43
THE PLANT OR MOVE WITHIN THE PLANT LIKE AN
ANIMAL HORMONE. AND


120
0:8:34,43 --> 0:8:38,419
LIKE ANIMAL HORMONES THEY'RE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS
THAT MODIFY OR


121
0:8:38,419 --> 0:8:44,63
CONTROL ONE OR MORE PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES.
AND THOSE


122
0:8:44,63 --> 0:8:48,92
PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES OFTEN HAVE TO DO WITH
PROMOTING OR


123
0:8:48,92 --> 0:8:53,74
INHIBITING GROWTH. THOUGH THESE ARE RESPONSES
LIKE CELL


124
0:8:53,74 --> 0:8:58,779
DIVISION, CELL ELONGATION, OR CELLULAR DIFFERENTIATION
OR


125
0:8:58,779 --> 0:9:5,37
MATURATION, THE THREE MAJOR ASPECTS OF GROWTH.
AND I JUST


126
0:9:5,37 --> 0:9:7,3
MENTIONED THIS, THEY'RE OFTEN TRANSPORTED
FROM THE SITE OF


127
0:9:7,3 --> 0:9:11,48
STIMULUS RECEPTION TO THE SITE OF RESPONSE.
AND ONE OF THE


128
0:9:11,48 --> 0:9:14,79
INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT HORMONES IN GENERAL
IS THAT THEY, THEY


129
0:9:14,79 --> 0:9:14,79



130
0:9:14,79 --> 0:9:18,87
CAN BE, THEY CAN HAVE A VERY STRONG EFFECT
WITH VERY LOW


131
0:9:18,87 --> 0:9:23,72
CONCENTRATIONS. AND THE AMOUNT OF THE HORMONE
PRESENT CAN HAVE


132
0:9:23,72 --> 0:9:28,839
A HUGE EFFECT ON ITS, ON ITS ACTION ON, ON
THE SIGNAL THAT IT


133
0:9:28,839 --> 0:9:33,79
PROVIDES TO THE PLANT. AND ALSO THAT ACTION
CAN BE AFFECTED BY


134
0:9:33,79 --> 0:9:38,759
THE TYPE OF TISSUE IN WHICH THE HORMONE IS
IN CONTACT OR, OR THE


135
0:9:38,759 --> 0:9:45,29
AGE OF THAT TISSUE, ITS STATE OF MATURATION.
AND THESE ARE


136
0:9:45,29 --> 0:9:48,31
INVOLVED IN JUST ABOUT EVERY ASPECT OF PLANT
GROWTH AND


137
0:9:48,31 --> 0:9:52,94
DEVELOPMENT. AND ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS
ABOUT PLANT


138
0:9:52,94 --> 0:9:56,54
HORMONES THAT MAKES THEM SO DIFFICULT TO STUDY
BUT ALSO


139
0:9:56,54 --> 0:10:1,72
FASCINATING IS THAT THERE, AN INDIVIDUAL HORMONE
CAN BE INVOLVED


140
0:10:1,72 --> 0:10:5,56
IN MANY DIFFERENT RESPONSES IN PLANTS. AS
I JUST MENTIONED, THE


141
0:10:5,56 --> 0:10:10,24
SITE OF ACTION, THE AGE OF THE TISSUE, THE
AMOUNT OF HORMONE


142
0:10:10,24 --> 0:10:15,69
PRESENT CAN HAVE A BIG EFFECT ON THE RESPONSE.
AND ALSO AN


143
0:10:15,69 --> 0:10:18,829
INDIVIDUAL RESPONSE CAN INVOLVE MULTIPLE HORMONES,
DIFFERENT


144
0:10:18,829 --> 0:10:22,379
HORMONES. AND IT'S THE RELATIVE CONCENTRATION
OF THESE


145
0:10:22,379 --> 0:10:26,399
DIFFERENT HORMONES THAT'S MOST IMPORTANT GENERALLY,
WHAT WE CAN


146
0:10:26,399 --> 0:10:29,319
THINK OF AS HORMONAL BALANCE WHICH IS SOMETHING
WE ALSO THINK


147
0:10:29,319 --> 0:10:33,8
ABOUT IN ANIMALS. THOUGH THE HORMONAL BALANCE,
WE'LL TALK ABOUT


148
0:10:33,8 --> 0:10:40,829
THAT A COUPLE OF TIMES HERE TODAY, IS REALLY
IMPORTANT. SO JUST


149
0:10:40,829 --> 0:10:46,47
LIKE SO MANY THINGS IN BIOLOGY, SOME OF THE
EARLIEST INSIGHTFUL


150
0:10:46,47 --> 0:10:51,0
WORK ON THESE, ON PLANT HORMONES WAS DONE
BY CHARLES DARWIN IN


151
0:10:51,0 --> 0:10:54,36
ASSOCIATION WITH HIS SON FRANCIS BACK NEAR
THE END OF HIS LIFE IN


152
0:10:54,36 --> 0:10:59,329
THE 1880S. AND WHAT THEY DID IS THEY, THEY
GREW UP GRASS


153
0:10:59,329 --> 0:11:5,29
SEEDLINGS. AND REMEMBER GRASSES GERMINATE
DIRECTLY THROUGH THE


154
0:11:5,29 --> 0:11:9,55
SOIL, THE TIP OF THE SHOOT EMERGES SHEATHED
IN A, WHAT'S CALLED A


155
0:11:9,55 --> 0:11:9,55



156
0:11:9,55 --> 0:11:15,19
COLEOPTILE, THE SHEATH THAT EMERGES DIRECTLY
FROM THE, FROM THE


157
0:11:15,19 --> 0:11:20,91
SOIL. AND IT WAS THE BENDING OF THESE COLEOPTILES
IN RESPONSE


158
0:11:20,91 --> 0:11:25,379
TO LIGHT THAT, THAT THE DARWINS STUDIED. AND
SO THEY FOUND


159
0:11:25,379 --> 0:11:30,629
THAT, THAT THESE COLEOPTILES WOULD BEND TOWARD
THE LIGHT WHICH IS


160
0:11:30,629 --> 0:11:35,81
A PRETTY ADAPTIVE RESPONSE IT SEEMED TO IN
TERMS OF MAXIMIZING


161
0:11:35,81 --> 0:11:38,8
PHOTOSYNTHESIS. AND SO THEY WANTED TO UNDERSTAND
HOW THAT


162
0:11:38,8 --> 0:11:44,519
OCCURRED AND WHAT THAT INVOLVED. SO THEY DID
VARIOUS THINGS,


163
0:11:44,519 --> 0:11:47,36
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THEY DID THAT WAS INTERESTING
IS THEY CUT


164
0:11:47,36 --> 0:11:51,579
OFF THE TIP OF THAT COLEOPTILE, AND THEY SAW
THAT NO BENDING,


165
0:11:51,579 --> 0:11:57,649
THIS GROWTH RESPONSE THAT RESULTED IN BENDING
DIDN'T OCCUR. AND


166
0:11:57,649 --> 0:12:1,4
SO MAYBE THAT WAS JUST SOME SORT OF WOUND
RES, A PROBLEM WITH


167
0:12:1,4 --> 0:12:4,689
WOUNDING THE PLANTS. SO THEY COVERED UP THE
TIP WITH A, A LIGHT


168
0:12:4,689 --> 0:12:12,89
IMPENETRABLE COVER. AND THEY ALSO SAW NO BENDING.
SO THE NEXT


169
0:12:12,89 --> 0:12:14,98
THING THEY TRIED IS THEY COVERED UP THE AREA
WHERE THE BENDING


170
0:12:14,98 --> 0:12:21,779
ACTUALLY OCCURS, AND THE THING STILL BENT.
SO THEY CONCLUDED


171
0:12:21,779 --> 0:12:30,689
THAT LIGHT IS SENSED BY THE TOP OF THE SHOOT
AND THAT, THAT SOME


172
0:12:30,689 --> 0:12:36,43
SORT OF HORMONAL SIGNAL IS SENT DOWN THE,
THROUGH THE PLANT TO A,


173
0:12:36,43 --> 0:12:39,889
A POINT OF RESPONSE WHERE THERE'S A GROWTH
RESPONSE THAT RESULTS


174
0:12:39,889 --> 0:12:43,149
IN BENDING TOWARD LIGHT. SO THIS WAS THE FIRST
EVIDENCE FOR


175
0:12:43,149 --> 0:12:49,29
PLANT HORMONES. AND THIS ELICITED A LOT OF
INTEREST BY OTHERS.


176
0:12:49,29 --> 0:12:52,36
AND THERE WERE OTHER EXPERIMENTS DONE WITH
THE SAME SYSTEM AFTER


177
0:12:52,36 --> 0:12:57,86
DARWIN. AND ONE OF THEM WAS THIS ONE WHICH
ESTABLISHED THAT


178
0:12:57,86 --> 0:13:2,98
THIS PHOTOPTROPIC SIGNAL IS ACTUALLY A CHEMICAL
AS DARWIN


179
0:13:2,98 --> 0:13:7,319
SUSPECTED. AND WHAT WAS DONE HERE WAS THAT
THE SLICED OFF TIP


180
0:13:7,319 --> 0:13:12,22
OF THE COLEOPTILE IS PLACED ON A LITTLE BLOCK
OF AGAR. WE TALKED


181
0:13:12,22 --> 0:13:12,22



182
0:13:12,22 --> 0:13:16,66
ABOUT AGAR, OF COURSE, IS THE, THIS CARBOHYDRATE
EXTRACTED FROM


183
0:13:16,66 --> 0:13:22,379
RED ALGAE. AND IT'S PERMEABLE. THIS WAS PLACED
IN BETWEEN THE


184
0:13:22,379 --> 0:13:27,23
REST OF THE COLEOPTILE AND ITS TIP. AND WHAT
WAS SEEN IS THIS


185
0:13:27,23 --> 0:13:30,6
GROWTH RESPONSE STILL OCCURRED, WHEREAS IF
YOU PUT A PLACE,


186
0:13:30,6 --> 0:13:34,56
WHEREAS IF AN IMPENETRABLE OBJECT WAS PLACED
BETWEEN THE TIP AND


187
0:13:34,56 --> 0:13:39,579
THE REST OF THE COLEOPTILE, IN THIS CASE A
LITTLE SHEET OF MICA,


188
0:13:39,579 --> 0:13:43,17
THERE WAS NO BENDING. SO THE CONCLUSION FROM
THIS EXPERIMENT


189
0:13:43,17 --> 0:13:47,689
WAS THAT INDEED SOME CHEMICAL WAS TRANSMITTED
DOWN THROUGH THE,


190
0:13:47,689 --> 0:13:53,23
THROUGH THE COLEOPTILE AS DARWIN SUSPECTED.
OKAY, THEN IT


191
0:13:53,23 --> 0:14:1,249
WASN'T UNTIL THE 1920S THAT FRITZ WENT AT
CAL TECH PERFORMED A


192
0:14:1,249 --> 0:14:6,529
KIND OF DECISIVE EXPERIMENT HERE WHERE BASICALLY
USING THE SAME


193
0:14:6,529 --> 0:14:11,519
SYSTEM, THIS TIP OF THE COLEOPTILE THAT HAD
BEEN INITIATED OR HAD


194
0:14:11,519 --> 0:14:17,3
BEEN EXPOSED TO LIGHT AND HAD UNDERGONE SOME
EXPOSURE TO LIGHT


195
0:14:17,3 --> 0:14:23,73
WAS CUTOFF AND PLACED AGAIN ON A LITTLE BLOCK
OF AGAR WITH A


196
0:14:23,73 --> 0:14:28,66
SUFFICIENT TIME FOR ANY DIFFUSION TO OCCUR
INTO THIS AGAR WHICH


197
0:14:28,66 --> 0:14:35,49
WAS SHOWN HERE BY THE RED, THE ACTIVE SUBSTANCE
HERE. AND THEN


198
0:14:35,49 --> 0:14:40,6
THIS WAS PLACED ON DIFFERENT COLEOPTILES THAT
HAD ALSO HAD THEIR


199
0:14:40,6 --> 0:14:45,99
TOPS, THEIR TIPS EXCISED THAT HADN'T BEEN
EXPOSED TO LIGHT. AND


200
0:14:45,99 --> 0:14:50,209
IT WAS PLACED OFFSET TO ONE SIDE, EITHER ONE
SIDE OR THE OTHER ON


201
0:14:50,209 --> 0:14:54,319
DIFFERENT COLEOPTILES. AND A GROWTH RESPONSE
WAS SEEN WITH


202
0:14:54,319 --> 0:15:0,54
BENDING AWAY FROM THE, THE EDGE THAT THE AGAR
WAS PLACED ON.


203
0:15:0,54 --> 0:15:3,86
AND WHEN THE TISSUES OF THOSE COLEOPTILES
WAS LOOKED AT IN MORE


204
0:15:3,86 --> 0:15:10,42
DETAIL DOWN NEAR THE AREA OF BENDING, IT WAS,
WENT SAW THAT THE


205
0:15:10,42 --> 0:15:15,6
CELLS HAD ELONGATED ALONG THE SIDE THAT THE
AGAR WAS PLACED ON.


206
0:15:15,6 --> 0:15:19,3
SO THE IDEA HERE WAS THAT THEN NOT ONLY WAS
A CHEMICAL


207
0:15:19,3 --> 0:15:19,3



208
0:15:19,3 --> 0:15:23,29
TRANSMITTED DOWN HERE, THE CHEMICAL WAS RESULTING
IN AN


209
0:15:23,29 --> 0:15:28,769
ELONGATION OF CELLS ALONG THE SIDE OR IN RESPONSE
TO THIS


210
0:15:28,769 --> 0:15:34,79
CHEMICAL. AND SO APPARENTLY ON THE DARK SIDE
OF THE COLEOPTILE


211
0:15:34,79 --> 0:15:41,249
AWAY FROM LIGHT, THERE WAS, THERE WAS A GROWTH
RESPONSE BY THIS


212
0:15:41,249 --> 0:15:44,759
TRANSMITTED CHEMICAL WHICH HE CALLED AUXIN
WHICH JUST MEANS TO


213
0:15:44,759 --> 0:15:48,67
INCREASE. IT WASN'T KNOWN WHAT IT WAS AT THE
TIME. IT WAS


214
0:15:48,67 --> 0:15:52,649
LATER DISCOVERED TO BE INDOLEACETIC ACID.
AND THERE'S SOME


215
0:15:52,649 --> 0:15:59,35
OTHER RELATED SUBSTANCES CALLED AUXINS AS
WELL THAT HAVE A NUMBER


216
0:15:59,35 --> 0:16:2,819
OF DIFFERENT RESPONSES. AND SO THIS WAS THE
FIRST PLANT HORMONE


217
0:16:2,819 --> 0:16:5,23
THAT WAS REALLY STUDIED, AND IT TURNS OUT
TO BE A REALLY


218
0:16:5,23 --> 0:16:9,899
IMPORTANT PLANT HORMONE. AND LIKE OTHER PLANT
HORMONES, IT'S


219
0:16:9,899 --> 0:16:12,899
INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT EFFECTS.
AND ONE OF THE ONES


220
0:16:12,899 --> 0:16:16,779
WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT IS APICAL DOMINANCE,
THAT IS HOW A


221
0:16:16,779 --> 0:16:23,209
SHOOT WILL HAVE A, A PRIMARY APICAL MERISTEM
THAT'S ACTIVE


222
0:16:23,209 --> 0:16:26,249
WHEREAS AXILLARY MERISTEMS WILL BE SUPPRESSED,
THEY'LL BE


223
0:16:26,249 --> 0:16:31,699
INHIBITED OR WON'T BE ACTIVE. AND IT TURNS
OUT AS WE ALREADY


224
0:16:31,699 --> 0:16:36,949
MENTIONED, IF YOU CUT OFF THE TIP, THE ACTIVE
TIP OF A SHOOT,


225
0:16:36,949 --> 0:16:42,829
THESE AXILLARY BUDS THAT ARE FOUND IN THE
UPPER AXLES OF LEAVES


226
0:16:42,829 --> 0:16:47,509
HERE WILL SUDDENLY BE INITIATED. AND HERE
YOU CAN SEE A LITTLE,


227
0:16:47,509 --> 0:16:51,89
SOME EVIDENCE OF THIS. THIS TIP WAS JUT CUT
OFF. AND HERE GO


228
0:16:51,89 --> 0:16:55,249
THE AXILLARY BUDS BECOMING NEW SHOOTS THAT
ARE GROWING UPWARD


229
0:16:55,249 --> 0:17:3,66
LIKE THE ORIGINAL TIP. AND ONE TYPICALLY BECOMES
DOMINANT. SO


230
0:17:3,66 --> 0:17:10,94
THAT'S A PRETTY STRONG AND, AND CLEAR RESPONSE
TO, TO THE REMOVAL


231
0:17:10,94 --> 0:17:14,49
OF THE APICAL MERISTEM. AND IT TURNS OUT THAT
STUDIES OF THE


232
0:17:14,49 --> 0:17:19,42
PRESENCE OF AUXIN WITHIN SHOOTS SHOWS THAT
THE ACTIVE APICAL


233
0:17:19,42 --> 0:17:19,42



234
0:17:19,42 --> 0:17:23,99
MERISTEM IS WHERE AUXIN IS PRODUCED AT HIGH,
RELATIVELY HIGH


235
0:17:23,99 --> 0:17:30,19
CONCENTRATIONS. AND WITH ITS REMOVAL THEN
WE HAVE REMOVAL OF


236
0:17:30,19 --> 0:17:33,87
WHAT'S ASSUMED TO BE AN, WHAT APPEARS TO BE
AN INHIBITOR OF


237
0:17:33,87 --> 0:17:39,15
THESE, OF THESE SIDE SHOOTS OF THESE AXILLARY
BUDS. AND WE'LL


238
0:17:39,15 --> 0:17:45,16
GET MORE TO THAT IN A MINUTE. SO AS I MENTIONED
ALSO AROUND


239
0:17:45,16 --> 0:17:48,96
THESE PLANT HORMONES HAVE DIFFERENT EFFECTS
ON DIFFERENT TISSUES.


240
0:17:48,96 --> 0:17:54,3
AND ANOTHER COMPLETELY DIFFERENT EFFECT OCCURS
WITH AUXIN IN THE


241
0:17:54,3 --> 0:17:57,7
PRESENCE OF OVARY TISSUE. AND SO ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT'S BEEN


242
0:17:57,7 --> 0:18:2,32
SEEN IS THAT AUXIN IS PRODUCED IN PROXIMITY
TO OR PERHAPS BY THE


243
0:18:2,32 --> 0:18:10,29
SEEDS OF A DEVELOPING OVARY, A DEVELOPING
FRUIT. AND HERE WE


244
0:18:10,29 --> 0:18:13,36
CAN SEE A NORMAL TOMATO WHERE THERE WAS NORMAL
POLLINATION AND


245
0:18:13,36 --> 0:18:17,97
FERTILIZATION WITH THE AUXIN PRODUCED IN THE
VICINITY OF THE


246
0:18:17,97 --> 0:18:21,0
SEEDS BEING IMPORTANT FOR NORMAL FRUIT DEVELOPMENT.
AND IN THE


247
0:18:21,0 --> 0:18:24,99
ABSENCE OF FERTILIZATION OF THOSE SEEDS, IF
THERE'S NO


248
0:18:24,99 --> 0:18:29,34
POLLINATION, THE TOMATO FRUIT WON'T DEVELOP.
BUT IF YOU APPLY


249
0:18:29,34 --> 0:18:32,55
AUXIN, IF YOU SPRAY AUXIN ON THAT OVARY, EVEN
IF THERE'S NO


250
0:18:32,55 --> 0:18:36,84
POLLINATION, THE OVARY CAN DEVELOP, AND THIS
IS DONE TO ENSURE


251
0:18:36,84 --> 0:18:41,1
FRUIT DEVELOPMENT IN TOMATOES AND SOME OTHER
FRUITS IN THE


252
0:18:41,1 --> 0:18:47,46
ABSENCE OF ANY POLLINATORS. SO AUXIN DOES
HAVE THIS ABILITY,


253
0:18:47,46 --> 0:18:54,27
THIS, THIS SIGNALING FOR FRUIT DEVELOPMENT.
THOUGH AGAIN, AUXIN


254
0:18:54,27 --> 0:19:1,1
IS INVOLVED IN CELL ELONGATION, NOT DIVISION,
BUT ELONGATION IN


255
0:19:1,1 --> 0:19:3,65
COLEOPTILES ON THE DARK SIDE OF THE SHOOT,
ON STEMS ON THE LIGHT


256
0:19:3,65 --> 0:19:7,34
SIDE IT TURNS OUT. SO THOSE EXPERIMENTS BY
DARWIN AND OTHERS


257
0:19:7,34 --> 0:19:10,64
WERE A LITTLE BIT MISLEADING. AUXIN OPERATES
IN SLIGHTLY


258
0:19:10,64 --> 0:19:14,26
DIFFERENT WAYS IN STEMS BUT ALSO IN REGARD
TO ELONGATION OF


259
0:19:14,26 --> 0:19:14,71



260
0:19:14,71 --> 0:19:19,11
CELLS. IT ALSO OPERATES IN APICAL DOMINANCE,
FRUIT DEVELOPMENT,


261
0:19:19,11 --> 0:19:22,78
AND IN LATERAL ROOT FORMATION, FORMATION OF
BRANCHING FROM THE


262
0:19:22,78 --> 0:19:30,68
ROOTS AS I'LL TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT. ALL
RIGHT, SO ANOTHER


263
0:19:30,68 --> 0:19:32,97
POINT THAT I MADE EARLIER JUST BRIEFLY WAS
THAT DIFFERENT


264
0:19:32,97 --> 0:19:36,62
CONCENTRATIONS OF HORMONES CAN HAVE REALLY
DIFFERENT EFFECTS ON


265
0:19:36,62 --> 0:19:41,57
THE TISSUES THAT THEY'RE IN CONTACT WITH.
AND THIS IS THE CASE


266
0:19:41,57 --> 0:19:45,51
WITH AUXIN, AS YOU CAN SEE HERE'S A GRADIENT
OF AUXIN FROM LOW TO


267
0:19:45,51 --> 0:19:51,37
HIGH CONCENTRATION, HIGHER IN THIS DIRECTION.
AND HERE WE CAN


268
0:19:51,37 --> 0:19:54,92
SEE A POSITIVE EFFECT OF GROWTH EFFECT AND
AN INHIBITORY EFFECT


269
0:19:54,92 --> 0:20:0,64
OF AUXIN WITH NO EFFECT HERE. SO WHAT YOU
SEE HERE IS THAT


270
0:20:0,64 --> 0:20:3,28
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE PLANT ARE SENSITIVE
TO DIFFERENT


271
0:20:3,28 --> 0:20:11,49
CONCENTRATIONS. BUT IN EACH CASE THERE'S A,
A RESPONSE THAT'S


272
0:20:11,49 --> 0:20:15,4
QUITE SIMILAR AS AUXIN IS INCREASED BUT AT
DIFFERENT LEVELS. SO


273
0:20:15,4 --> 0:20:18,78
WE INITIALLY GET AN INCREASE IN GROWTH BUT
THEN AN INHIBITION OF


274
0:20:18,78 --> 0:20:23,11
GROWTH. AND IF WE LOOK AT THIS IN STEMS, YOU
CAN SEE THE


275
0:20:23,11 --> 0:20:27,9
CONCENTRATION OF AUXIN THAT'S MAXIMALLY STIMULATIVE
OF STEM


276
0:20:27,9 --> 0:20:31,21
GROWTH IS STRONGLY INHIBITING OF BUD GROWTH,
OF THOSE AXILLARY


277
0:20:31,21 --> 0:20:37,66
BUDS AS THAT EXPERIMENT WITH CUTTING OFF THE
TIP SHOWED. AND,


278
0:20:37,66 --> 0:20:40,87
OF COURSE, THE STEM TIP IS PRODUCING A LOT
OF AUXIN, SO YOU CUT


279
0:20:40,87 --> 0:20:46,88
OFF THAT TIP, THE AMOUNT OF AUXIN IS REDUCED
IN THE STEM. AND


280
0:20:46,88 --> 0:20:51,72
WE END UP WITH MAXIMAL INITIATION OF BUDS
AND SUPPRESSION OF


281
0:20:51,72 --> 0:20:55,39
ROOTS AT THAT LEVEL. STEMS AREN'T EVEN EFFECTED
AT THE LEVEL


282
0:20:55,39 --> 0:21:3,16
THAT INITIATES BUD GROWTH IN TERMS OF THE
MAIN STEM. SO,


283
0:21:3,16 --> 0:21:3,59
QUESTION? YEAH, BRAD?


284
0:21:3,59 --> 0:21:8,56
STUDENT: IS AUXIN JUST KIND OF A GENERIC TERM
FOR THE FAMILY OF


285
0:21:8,56 --> 0:21:8,56



286
0:21:8,56 --> 0:21:9,96
HORMONES.


287
0:21:9,96 --> 0:21:13,45
PROFESSOR: THAT'S RIGHT. YEAH, IT'S JUST A
GENERIC TERM. IT'S


288
0:21:13,45 --> 0:21:21,49
NOT SPECIFIC AS TO CHEMISTRY IN PARTICULAR,
THAT'S RIGHT.


289
0:21:21,49 --> 0:21:28,57
CYTOKININS ARE, WERE DISCOVERED MUCH LATER
IN THE 1940S, BUT


290
0:21:28,57 --> 0:21:31,53
THEY'RE ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT. AND IT TURNS
OUT THAT THE


291
0:21:31,53 --> 0:21:36,13
BALANCE OF CYTOKININ TO AUXIN IS, IS REALLY
IMPORTANT FOR A PLANT


292
0:21:36,13 --> 0:21:42,91
TO, FOR THE PLANT GROWTH RESPONSE. AND SO
CYTOKININS ARE NAMED


293
0:21:42,91 --> 0:21:47,2
BECAUSE THEY PROMOTE CELL DIVISION. AND CYTOKININ
COMES FROM


294
0:21:47,2 --> 0:21:51,7
CYTOKINESIS OR CELL DIVISION. OKAY, SO THAT'S
AN EASY WAY TO


295
0:21:51,7 --> 0:21:56,34
REMEMBER THE TERM. REMEMBER THAT AUXINS PROMOTE
ELONGATION OF


296
0:21:56,34 --> 0:22:2,5
CELLS, NOT DIVISION OF CELLS, SO CYTOKININS
OPERATING WITH AUXINS


297
0:22:2,5 --> 0:22:5,62
ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE OVERALL GROWTH RESPONSE
SINCE BOTH DIVISION


298
0:22:5,62 --> 0:22:10,32
AND ELONGATION ARE IMPORTANT IN GROWTH. AND
SO A HIGH


299
0:22:10,32 --> 0:22:17,18
CYTOKININ:AUXIN RATIO PROMOTES ACTIVATION
OF, OF SHOOT BRANCHING,


300
0:22:17,18 --> 0:22:22,52
THIS AXILLARY BUD BRANCHING THAT WE TALKED
ABOUT. AND THE, A


301
0:22:22,52 --> 0:22:27,76
LOW CYTOKININ:AUXIN RATIO PROMOTES ACTIVATION
OF LATERAL ROOTS,


302
0:22:27,76 --> 0:22:32,99
SO BRANCHING OF THE ROOTS. AND I MENTIONED
THAT AUXIN CAN


303
0:22:32,99 --> 0:22:36,36
STIMULATE LATERAL ROOT PRODUCTION. AND IT'S
REALLY THE LOW


304
0:22:36,36 --> 0:22:40,76
CYTOKININ:AUXIN RATIO THAT PROMOTES THAT RELATIVELY
HIGH AUXIN


305
0:22:40,76 --> 0:22:47,48
COMPARED TO CYTOKININ HERE. SO I ALREADY MENTIONED
THIS THAT


306
0:22:47,48 --> 0:22:51,65
CYTOKININ PROMOTES DEVELOPMENT OF BRANCHES
FOR, ACTUALLY I DIDN'T


307
0:22:51,65 --> 0:22:54,54
MENTION THAT. I MENTIONED THAT THE REDUCTION
IN THE AMOUNT OF


308
0:22:54,54 --> 0:23:1,5
AUXIN RESULTS IN THE BRANCHING OF THE SIDE
SHOOTS. BUT WHAT IT


309
0:23:1,5 --> 0:23:5,13
REALLY IS IS THAT THE CYTOKININ RATIO, THERE'S
A HIGH


310
0:23:5,13 --> 0:23:9,69
CYTOKININ:AUXIN RATIO WHEN, AFTER THE TIP
IS REMOVED. AND


311
0:23:9,69 --> 0:23:9,69



312
0:23:9,69 --> 0:23:13,64
THAT'S, THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT WITH REGARD
TO THE OVERALL


313
0:23:13,64 --> 0:23:22,66
BRANCHING OF THE SHOOT. AND INTERESTINGLY,
THE, THE CYTOKININS


314
0:23:22,66 --> 0:23:25,94
AND AUXINS ARE PRODUCED IN DIFFERENT PARTS
OF THE PLANT BODY,


315
0:23:25,94 --> 0:23:29,4
AND THEY'RE, THEY'RE MOBILIZED. THEY MOVE
IN OPPOSITE


316
0:23:29,4 --> 0:23:33,46
DIRECTIONS IN THE PLANT. SO THE AUXIN IS MOVING
AS I MENTIONED


317
0:23:33,46 --> 0:23:39,5
FROM THE SHOOT TIPS DOWNWARD, AND IT STILL
MOVES TOWARD THE ROOTS


318
0:23:39,5 --> 0:23:42,4
EVEN IF YOU TURN THE PLANT UPSIDE-DOWN. THIS
IS NOT A GRAVITY


319
0:23:42,4 --> 0:23:48,5
RESPONSE. AND CYTOKININS ARE TYPICALLY PRODUCED
IN THE ROOTS


320
0:23:48,5 --> 0:23:53,29
AND TRANSPORTED UPWARD TOWARD THE SHOOT. AND
SO THIS CREATES A


321
0:23:53,29 --> 0:23:57,64
GRADIENT OF CYTOKININ AND AUXIN WITHIN THE
PLANT BODY THAT'S


322
0:23:57,64 --> 0:24:3,11
IMPORTANT IN MAINTAINING THIS HORMONAL BALANCE
ACROSS THE PLANT.


323
0:24:3,11 --> 0:24:5,51
OKAY, SO THAT'S, THAT'S ONE OF THE INTERESTING
THINGS THAT WAS


324
0:24:5,51 --> 0:24:9,69
DISCOVERED ABOUT, ABOUT THIS INTERPLAY BETWEEN
CYTOKININS AND


325
0:24:9,69 --> 0:24:12,75
AUXINS IS THEIR DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT IS DIFFERENT,
THEIR PLACE


326
0:24:12,75 --> 0:24:15,88
OF PRODUCTION IS DIFFERENT, AND THAT HELPS
TO SET UP THIS


327
0:24:15,88 --> 0:24:21,53
GRADIENT THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IN GROWTH.
ALL RIGHT, SO


328
0:24:21,53 --> 0:24:25,83
CYTOKININS THEN IMPORTANT IN CELL DIVISION
AND DIFFERENTIATION


329
0:24:25,83 --> 0:24:29,52
IN CONCERT WITH, WITH AUXINS INVOLVED IN CELL
ELONGATION FOR THE


330
0:24:29,52 --> 0:24:38,39
OVERALL GROWTH RESPONSE, AND ALSO AXILLARY
BUD GROWTH,


331
0:24:38,39 --> 0:24:41,69
PARTICULARLY WHEN APICAL DOMINANCE IS REMOVED
BY DAMAGE TO THE


332
0:24:41,69 --> 0:24:46,67
SHOOT TIP. BUT ALSO, FOR EXAMPLE, AT LOWER
POINTS ON THE STEM


333
0:24:46,67 --> 0:24:51,11
WHERE YOU HAVE A HIGHER CYTOKININ:AUXIN RATIO,
AS YOU, AS YOU GET


334
0:24:51,11 --> 0:24:54,5
FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM THE SHOOT TIP,
THERE'S LESS


335
0:24:54,5 --> 0:25:0,64
INHIBITION OF BUDS TYPICALLY. ALL RIGHT, ANOTHER
CLASS OF,


336
0:25:0,64 --> 0:25:4,33
THIRD CLASS OF PLANT HORMONES ARE CALLED GIBBERELLINS.
AND


337
0:25:4,33 --> 0:25:4,81



338
0:25:4,81 --> 0:25:8,57
THESE ARE CALLED GIBBERELLINS BECAUSE THEY
WERE ORIGINALLY


339
0:25:8,57 --> 0:25:12,44
DISCOVERED IN A PLANT THAT WAS INFECTED BY
A FUNGUS CALLED


340
0:25:12,44 --> 0:25:16,7
GIBBERELLA. IT'S JUST AN ASIDE, BUT THAT'S
WHERE THE NAME COMES


341
0:25:16,7 --> 0:25:22,71
FROM. AND THIS FUNGUS PRODUCED A COMPOUND
THAT WE CALLED


342
0:25:22,71 --> 0:25:27,7
GIBBERELLIN THAT RESULTED IN RICE SEEDLINGS
BEING STRONGLY, BEING


343
0:25:27,7 --> 0:25:33,46
VERY SPINDLY, HAVING AN UNCONTROLLED GROWTH
RESPONSE. AND SO,


344
0:25:33,46 --> 0:25:39,45
SO GIBBERELLINS HAVE A STRONG EFFECT IN STEM
ELONGATION AND


345
0:25:39,45 --> 0:25:43,9
OVERALL HAVE A STRONG GROWTH STIMULATING EFFECT.
SO THESE ARE


346
0:25:43,9 --> 0:25:47,42
SUBSTANCES WHICH TEND TO HAVE A STRONG GROWTH
STIMULATING EFFECT.


347
0:25:47,42 --> 0:25:51,37
THEY'RE ALSO IMPORTANT IN PROMOTING SEED GERMINATION,
SO THE


348
0:25:51,37 --> 0:25:55,85
BREAKING OF DORMANCY IN SEEDS, IN, ESPECIALLY
PLANTS THAT HAVE A


349
0:25:55,85 --> 0:25:59,98
LIGHT REQUIREMENT FOR GERMINATION. AND WE
USE GIBBERELLINS ALL


350
0:25:59,98 --> 0:26:4,73
THE TIME AT LOW REALLY CONCENTRATIONS TO GERMINATE
SEEDS OF


351
0:26:4,73 --> 0:26:9,91
CERTAIN PLANT SPECIES IN MY LAB. AND YOU CAN
GO FROM A PLANT


352
0:26:9,91 --> 0:26:12,75
THAT YOU CAN BARELY GET TO GERMINATE, YOU
HAVE TO DISSECT THE


353
0:26:12,75 --> 0:26:16,75
EMBRYOS OUT TO GET THEM TO GERMINATE, TO HAVING
THEM ALMOST JUMP


354
0:26:16,75 --> 0:26:19,57
OUT OF THE SEEDS. I MEAN JUST WITHIN LESS
THAN 12 HOURS THEY'LL


355
0:26:19,57 --> 0:26:25,59
BE FULLY GERMINATED. SO THESE HAVE A PRETTY
STRONG EFFECT WHEN,


356
0:26:25,59 --> 0:26:33,26
IN PLANTS THAT RECOGNIZE THEM FOR, AS A STIMULUS
FOR GERMINATION.


357
0:26:33,26 --> 0:26:35,9
AND THEY'RE ALSO USED COMMERCIALLY TO PROMOTE
FRUIT ENLARGEMENT


358
0:26:35,9 --> 0:26:40,29
AND BUNCH LENGTH IN SEEDLESS GRAPES. WE ALREADY
TALKED ABOUT HOW


359
0:26:40,29 --> 0:26:45,46
AUXIN CAN STIMULATE THE INITIATION OF GROWTH
OF FRUIT


360
0:26:45,46 --> 0:26:48,66
DEVELOPMENT. AND GIBBERELLINS CAN ACTUALLY
RESULT IN LARGER


361
0:26:48,66 --> 0:26:52,78
FRUITS. HERE'S A, A BUNCH OF GRAPES THAT WEREN'T
TREATED WITH A


362
0:26:52,78 --> 0:26:56,6
GIBBERELLIN SPRAY. AND HERE ARE SOME THAT
WERE TREATED WITH A


363
0:26:56,6 --> 0:26:56,6



364
0:26:56,6 --> 0:27:5,2
GIBBERELLIN SPRAY. SO GIBBERELLINS HAVE A
LOT OF USES. AND


365
0:27:5,2 --> 0:27:10,13
THEY ALSO CAN BE PRODUCED BY PLANTS IN, AS
A WOUND RESPONSE AND


366
0:27:10,13 --> 0:27:14,7
CAN PROMOTE HEALING IN RESPONSE TO WOUNDING.
THEY HAVE A NUMBER


367
0:27:14,7 --> 0:27:16,9
OF RESPONSES. WE'RE JUST SORT OF SCRATCHING
THE SURFACE HERE IN


368
0:27:16,9 --> 0:27:22,3
TERMS OF SOME OF THE MORE OUTSTANDING FUNCTIONS.
AND YOU'VE


369
0:27:22,3 --> 0:27:28,17
PROBABLY SEEN BOLTING OCCUR BEFORE IN HERBS
THAT, HERBS THAT JUST


370
0:27:28,17 --> 0:27:32,23
HAVE BASAL LEAVES UNTIL THEY START TO PRODUCE
A FLOWERING SHOOT.


371
0:27:32,23 --> 0:27:34,36
AND THE PRODUCTION OF A FLOWERING SHOOT CAN
HAPPEN REALLY


372
0:27:34,36 --> 0:27:37,84
QUICKLY, SO QUICKLY THAT IT'S CALLED BOLTING.
AND THIS IS


373
0:27:37,84 --> 0:27:47,27
SOMETHING THAT'S STIMULATED BY GIBBERELLIC
ACID AS WELL.
AND


374
0:27:47,27 --> 0:27:52,21
WHEN I ACTUALLY WAS A GSI IN A CLASS LIKE
THIS MANY YEARS AGO, WE


375
0:27:52,21 --> 0:27:56,46
DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT THESE COMPOUNDS, THESE
BRASSINOSTEROIDS.


376
0:27:56,46 --> 0:27:59,6
THESE HAVE JUST BEEN RECENTLY DISCOVERED TO
BE PLANT HORMONES.


377
0:27:59,6 --> 0:28:3,8
AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY STEROIDS SIMILAR TO,
TO ANIMAL SEX HORMONES


378
0:28:3,8 --> 0:28:7,15
IN TERMS OF THEIR OVERALL CHEMISTRY. BUT THEY'RE
SO SIMILAR IN


379
0:28:7,15 --> 0:28:11,29
FUNCTION TO AUXIN IN TERMS OF PROMOTING ELONGATION
OF STEMS THAT


380
0:28:11,29 --> 0:28:17,78
THEY WEREN'T RECOGNIZED AS DISTINCT FROM AUXIN.
AND IT'S PLANTS


381
0:28:17,78 --> 0:28:21,28
LIKE THESE THAT ALLOW THEM TO BE RECOGNIZED.
THESE ARE, THESE


382
0:28:21,28 --> 0:28:25,78
PLANTS ARE ONES, THESE LITTLE DWARF ONES HERE
ARE ONES THAT HAVE


383
0:28:25,78 --> 0:28:31,52
MINIMAL INTERNODAL ELONGATION AND HAPPEN TO
BE MUTANTS THAT DON'T


384
0:28:31,52 --> 0:28:35,64
PRODUCE BRASSINOSTEROIDS. AND THIS NAME BRASSINOSTEROIDS
COMES


385
0:28:35,64 --> 0:28:39,12
FROM THE FACT THAT THESE WERE DISCOVERED IN
ARABIDOPSIS WHICH IS


386
0:28:39,12 --> 0:28:43,71
THE MODEL SYSTEM FOR PLANT BIOLOGY AND IT'S
IN THE BRASSICACEAE


387
0:28:43,71 --> 0:28:47,1
FAMILY OR THE MUSTARD FAMILY. JUST AN ASIDE.
BUT THAT'S WHAT


388
0:28:47,1 --> 0:28:51,86
THE NAME COMES FROM. SO JUST TO LET YOU KNOW
THAT THESE ARE


389
0:28:51,86 --> 0:28:51,86



390
0:28:51,86 --> 0:28:56,31
STILL BEING DISCOVERED. THIS WAS A FAIRLY
RECENT DISCOVERY,


391
0:28:56,31 --> 0:29:3,75
SIMILAR TO AUXIN. AND THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT
PLANT HORMONE,


392
0:29:3,75 --> 0:29:10,11
ABSCISSIC ACID. WE JUST CALL IT ABA. THIS
ACTUALLY WORKS


393
0:29:10,11 --> 0:29:15,5
ANTAGONISTICALLY TO GIBBERELLINS. AND THE
RELATIVE BALANCE OF


394
0:29:15,5 --> 0:29:20,88
GIBBERELLINS AND ABA CAN BE IMPORTANT IN THE
GROWTH RESPONSE.


395
0:29:20,88 --> 0:29:23,52
SO I MENTIONED GIBBERELLINS HAVE A REALLY
STRONGLY STIMULATIVE


396
0:29:23,52 --> 0:29:29,21
EFFECT TO GROWTH AND SEED GERMINATION WHEREAS,
ABSCISSIC


397
0:29:29,21 --> 0:29:33,63
ACID IS JUST THE OPPOSITE. IT'S IMPORTANT,
IT HAS AN INHIBITING


398
0:29:33,63 --> 0:29:38,0
EFFECT ON STEM GROWTH. AND IT'S IMPORTANT
IN INDUCING SEED


399
0:29:38,0 --> 0:29:43,28
DORMANCY AND PREPARING THE SEED FOR DESICCATION
AS THE SEED


400
0:29:43,28 --> 0:29:49,31
MATURES. SO DORMANCY IN SEEDS IS USUALLY OFTEN
RESPONSIBLE,


401
0:29:49,31 --> 0:29:54,1
ABSCISIC ACID'S OFTEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT.
AND IT REQUIRES


402
0:29:54,1 --> 0:29:59,51
LONG PERIODS OF COLD OR SOME OTHER STIMULUS
TO BREAK DOWN ABA AND


403
0:29:59,51 --> 0:30:5,23
RELEASE THE PLANT FROM THAT DORMANCY CONDITION.
INTERESTINGLY,


404
0:30:5,23 --> 0:30:8,58
THERE ARE SOME PLANTS THAT DON'T PRODUCE MUCH
ABA IN THEIR SEEDS


405
0:30:8,58 --> 0:30:12,34
AND DON'T HAVE DORMANCY. MANGROVES ARE REALLY
NOTABLE IN THIS


406
0:30:12,34 --> 0:30:15,61
SENSE. THEY GERMINATE WHILE THEY'RE STILL
ON THE PARENT PLANT.


407
0:30:15,61 --> 0:30:21,1
HERE YOU CAN SEE THE RADICLES, EMBRYONIC ROOTS
EMERGING FROM


408
0:30:21,1 --> 0:30:24,65
SEEDS STILL IN THE FRUITS OF A MANGROVE THAT
HAVEN'T BEEN DROPPED


409
0:30:24,65 --> 0:30:28,32
YET FROM THE PARENT PLANT. AND THIS KIND OF
PRECOCIOUS


410
0:30:28,32 --> 0:30:32,97
GERMINATION IS IMPORTANT FOR THE SURVIVAL
OF MANGROVES. AND IT


411
0:30:32,97 --> 0:30:36,31
JUST SO HAPPENS THAT THOSE SEEDS ARE REALLY
LACKING IN ABSCISIC


412
0:30:36,31 --> 0:30:41,57
ACID.


413
0:30:41,57 --> 0:30:44,65
ANOTHER THING THAT ABA DOES THAT HAS A GROWTH
INHIBITING


414
0:30:44,65 --> 0:30:48,84
EFFECT BUT IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT FOR THE SURVIVAL
OF A PLANT IS


415
0:30:48,84 --> 0:30:53,34
THAT ABA WILL SIGNAL THE CLOSURE OF THE GUARD
CELLS AND THE


416
0:30:53,34 --> 0:30:53,34



417
0:30:53,34 --> 0:30:58,81
CLOSURE OF THE STOMATES, STOMATA IN, IN RESPONSE
TO WILTING OR


418
0:30:58,81 --> 0:31:1,59
ANY KIND OF DROUGHT STRESS THAT MIGHT BE PERCEIVED
IN THE ROOTS.


419
0:31:1,59 --> 0:31:5,8
ABA WILL BE TRANSMITTED, FOR EXAMPLE, TO THE
ROOTS, TO THE SHOOT


420
0:31:5,8 --> 0:31:10,73
BEFORE IT STARTS TO WILT. AND THIS SETS IN
MOTION THE RELEASE


421
0:31:10,73 --> 0:31:16,49
OF, OF POTASSIUM IONS FROM THE GUARD CELLS.
SO THE SOLUTE


422
0:31:16,49 --> 0:31:21,59
CONCENTRATION IS REDUCED IN THE GUARD CELLS,
AND WATER MOVES OUT


423
0:31:21,59 --> 0:31:26,46
OF THE GUARD CELLS THROUGHOUT, BASED ON OSMOTIC
RESPONSE. SO


424
0:31:26,46 --> 0:31:35,6
THAT'S, THAT'S CRUCIAL FOR PLANTS TO, TO KEEP
THEIR WATER BALANCE


425
0:31:35,6 --> 0:31:40,74
INTACT. AND ABA IS THE IMPORTANT CHEMICAL
SIGNAL IN THIS


426
0:31:40,74 --> 0:31:46,72
REGARD. SO AGAIN, ABSCISSIC ACID'S IMPORTANT
FOR DORMANCY,


427
0:31:46,72 --> 0:31:50,28
CLOSING A STOMATA, AND IN GENERAL IT'S A GROWTH
INHIBITOR. AND


428
0:31:50,28 --> 0:31:54,49
IT'S THIS BALANCE OF ABA AND GIBBERELLINS
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT


429
0:31:54,49 --> 0:32:5,9
IN MANY CASES. ALL RIGHT, SO ETHYLENE IS A
SUBSTANCE THAT WAS


430
0:32:5,9 --> 0:32:9,84
ONLY RECOGNIZED TO BE A PLANT GROWTH REGULATOR
RELATIVELY LATE.


431
0:32:9,84 --> 0:32:15,32
AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT FUNCTIONS IN THE GAS
PHASE, WHICH IS A


432
0:32:15,32 --> 0:32:21,75
BIZARRE THING FOR A HORMONE TO DO. BUT THIS
IS A VERY IMPORTANT


433
0:32:21,75 --> 0:32:25,31
MOLECULE FOR SIGNALING THE ONSET OF, FOR EXAMPLE,
LEAF SENESCENCE


434
0:32:25,31 --> 0:32:30,83
AND ABSCISSION IN DECIDUOUS PLANTS LIKE A
DECIDUOUS HARDWOOD


435
0:32:30,83 --> 0:32:35,9
TREES. AND DECIDUOUS PLANTS HAVE WHAT'S CALLED
AN ABSCISSION


436
0:32:35,9 --> 0:32:39,93
LAYER. IT'S A LITTLE LAYER OF PARENCHYMA AT
THE BASE OF THE


437
0:32:39,93 --> 0:32:44,62
LEAF. THERE ARE NO FIBERS, SCLERIFIED CELLS
THAT CROSS THROUGH


438
0:32:44,62 --> 0:32:50,1
THAT ZONE, SO THESE ARE JUST LIVING CELLS
THAT HAVE RELATIVELY


439
0:32:50,1 --> 0:32:54,4
THIN CELL WALLS. AND ETHYLENE WHEN IT'S PRODUCED,
WHAT HAPPENS


440
0:32:54,4 --> 0:33:0,6
FIRST IS THAT IT ACTUALLY RESULTS IN A PROGRAMMED
DEATH OF CELLS


441
0:33:0,6 --> 0:33:3,9
INSIDE THE LEAF. SO THE LEAF WILL UNDERGO
THIS PROCESS WHERE


442
0:33:3,9 --> 0:33:3,9



443
0:33:3,9 --> 0:33:9,43
THE NUTRIENTS THAT ARE ENCLOSED OR CONTAINED
WITHIN THAT LEAF ARE


444
0:33:9,43 --> 0:33:14,1
MOBILIZED BY THE BREAKDOWN OF SUBSTANCES IN
THE LEAF. AND THEN


445
0:33:14,1 --> 0:33:18,94
THOSE ARE MOVED BACK INTO THE MAIN BODY OF
THE PLANT. AND THEN


446
0:33:18,94 --> 0:33:25,39
THE ABSCISSION LAYER CHANGES START TO OCCUR
THERE WHERE ETHYLENE


447
0:33:25,39 --> 0:33:29,19
WILL STIMULATE THE PRODUCTION OF ENZYMES THAT
BREAK DOWN THE CELL


448
0:33:29,19 --> 0:33:32,76
WALLS OF THOSE PARENCHYMA CELLS IN THAT ABSCISSION
LAYER SUCH


449
0:33:32,76 --> 0:33:35,64
THAT EVENTUALLY THE LEAF WILL JUST FALL OFF
BASED ON ITS OWN


450
0:33:35,64 --> 0:33:40,95
WEIGHT OR BASED ON WIND. AND THEN CORK WILL
FORM OVER THAT


451
0:33:40,95 --> 0:33:46,28
WOUND, SO THAT PREVENTS INFECTION OF THE PLANT.
SO ETHYLENE HAS


452
0:33:46,28 --> 0:33:50,68
A REALLY IMPORTANT EFFECT IN, IN PROGRAMMED
CELL DEATH THAT CAN


453
0:33:50,68 --> 0:33:54,97
BE IMPORTANT IN CAPTURING BACK THE NUTRIENTS
THAT A PLANT NEEDS


454
0:33:54,97 --> 0:34:2,25
FROM TISSUES THAT ARE GOING TO BE DISCARDED.
AND IT ALSO HAS A


455
0:34:2,25 --> 0:34:6,43
REALLY IMPORTANT EFFECT IN FRUIT RIPENING.
SO ETHYLENE IS


456
0:34:6,43 --> 0:34:12,55
CRUCIAL IN FRUIT RIPENING RESPONSE. SO IT'S
INVOLVED IN BOTH


457
0:34:12,55 --> 0:34:16,46
THE ENZYMATIC BREAKDOWN OF THE CELL WALLS.
I MEAN IT SIGNALS


458
0:34:16,46 --> 0:34:19,84
THE ENZYMATIC, PRODUCTION OF ENZYMES THAT
BREAKDOWN THE CELL


459
0:34:19,84 --> 0:34:24,53
WALLS OF, IN THE FRUIT WHICH MAKES THE FRUIT
SOFT, INEDIBLE IN


460
0:34:24,53 --> 0:34:33,19
THAT SENSE. AND IT ALSO SIGNALS THE ENZYMES
OR IT, IT


461
0:34:33,19 --> 0:34:35,649
RESULTS IN THE PRODUCTION OF ENZYMES THAT
CONVERT STARCH TO


462
0:34:35,649 --> 0:34:42,389
SUGAR, SO MAKES THE FRUIT SWEET AS WELL SO
THE FRUIT BECOMES


463
0:34:42,389 --> 0:34:48,929
ATTRACTIVE TO ANIMALS AND, THAT DISPERSE THE
SEEDS AS A RESULT.


464
0:34:48,929 --> 0:34:51,659
AND THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW CASES IN BIOLOGY
OF A POSITIVE


465
0:34:51,659 --> 0:34:55,55
FEEDBACK MECHANISM WHERE THE PRODUCTION OF
ETHYLENE LEADS TO


466
0:34:55,55 --> 0:34:59,8
RIPENING. RIPENING THEN TRIGGERS MORE ETHYLENE
PRODUCTION. SO


467
0:34:59,8 --> 0:35:4,48
THIS ETHYLENE PRODUCTION IS INCREASED. AND
AS A GAS, ETHYLENE


468
0:35:4,48 --> 0:35:4,48



469
0:35:4,48 --> 0:35:7,95
PRODUCED BY ONE FRUIT CAN TRIGGER THE RIPENING
OF OTHER FRUIT IN


470
0:35:7,95 --> 0:35:11,75
CLOSE PROXIMITY, ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE IN
CLOSED CONTAINERS LIKE


471
0:35:11,75 --> 0:35:15,43
A PAPER BAG, FOR EXAMPLE. SO YOU'VE KNOW DOUBT
HAD THAT


472
0:35:15,43 --> 0:35:19,84
EXPERIENCE WHERE ONE FRUIT CAN CAUSE THE,
ONE RIPE FRUIT CAN, CAN


473
0:35:19,84 --> 0:35:24,52
BE IMPORTANT WITH REGARD TO THE RIPENING OF
OTHERS. AND SO


474
0:35:24,52 --> 0:35:29,12
ETHYLENE SINCE IT WAS DISCOVERED AS BEING
IMPORTANT IN THIS


475
0:35:29,12 --> 0:35:33,91
REGARD, IT'S USED COMMERCIALLY TO ALLOW FOR
THE PICKING OF FRUIT


476
0:35:33,91 --> 0:35:38,18
WHEN IT'S STILL UNRIPE AND TRANSPORTING IT
WHILE IT'S UNRIPE SO


477
0:35:38,18 --> 0:35:42,3
IT'S NOT DAMAGED DURING TRANSPORT AND THAT
IT LASTS. AND THEN


478
0:35:42,3 --> 0:35:47,21
ETHYLENE GAS IS APPLIED AFTER TRANSPORTATION
OR AFTER THE FRUIT'S


479
0:35:47,21 --> 0:35:50,45
READY TO BE MARKETED AND THE FRUIT WILL START
RIPENING AT THAT


480
0:35:50,45 --> 0:35:53,99
POINT. AND YOU CAN STORE FRUIT FOR LONG PERIODS
OF TIME, FOR


481
0:35:53,99 --> 0:35:58,61
MANY MONTHS IN AN UNRIPE STATE AS LONG AS
YOU CAN CONTROL THE


482
0:35:58,61 --> 0:36:3,25
ETHYLENE PRODUCTION BY THE FRUIT. AND SO THERE
ARE VARIOUS


483
0:36:3,25 --> 0:36:7,15
FILTRATION SYSTEMS THAT COMMERCIAL, THAT ARE
COMMERCIALLY


484
0:36:7,15 --> 0:36:12,97
AVAILABLE TO REMOVE ETHYLENE. CARBON DIOXIDE'S
ALSO APPLIED TO


485
0:36:12,97 --> 0:36:19,44
REMOVE ETHYLENE, SO THAT'S, THIS IS AN IMPORTANT
COMMERCIAL


486
0:36:19,44 --> 0:36:26,91
SUBSTANCE AS WELL. OKAY. SO ETHYLENE THEN
IS REALLY IMPORTANT


487
0:36:26,91 --> 0:36:35,33
IN BOTH LEAF ABSCISSION AND FRUIT RIPENING
AMONG OTHER THINGS.


488
0:36:35,33 --> 0:36:40,54
SO THAT'S REALLY ALL I WANT TO SAY ABOUT PLANT
HORMONES PER SE.


489
0:36:40,54 --> 0:36:42,88
WE CAN JUST SUMMARIZE THEM HERE. OF COURSE
THEY CAN HAVE A


490
0:36:42,88 --> 0:36:47,47
VARIETY OF EFFECTS DEPENDING ON THE SITE OF
ACTION, CONCENTRATION


491
0:36:47,47 --> 0:36:55,2
OF THE HORMONE, FOR EXAMPLE. AND THIS IS BASICALLY
WHAT I'M


492
0:36:55,2 --> 0:36:58,64
SAYING HERE. DIFFERENT PLANT PARTS HAVE DIFFERENT
SENSITIVITIES


493
0:36:58,64 --> 0:37:3,15
AND DIFFERENT CONCENTRATIONS. SO THIS WHOLE
NOTION OF


494
0:37:3,15 --> 0:37:3,15



495
0:37:3,15 --> 0:37:10,86
DIFFERENTIAL SENSITIVITY IS REALLY IMPORTANT.
AND FINALLY THE,


496
0:37:10,86 --> 0:37:13,35
THEY OFTEN ACT TOGETHER. AND THIS, I'VE ALREADY
MENTIONED THIS


497
0:37:13,35 --> 0:37:19,19
WITH REGARD TO AUXIN AND CYTOKININS WORKING
TOGETHER, THIS


498
0:37:19,19 --> 0:37:21,87
HORMONE BALANCE IN REGARD TO THOSE TWO AND
THEN THE BALANCE IN


499
0:37:21,87 --> 0:37:28,47
REGARD TO GIBBERELLINS AND ABA. SO THIS MAKES
THEM REALLY


500
0:37:28,47 --> 0:37:32,47
DIFFICULT TO STUDY, OF COURSE. IT'S, IT'S
A MORE, IN MANY WAYS


501
0:37:32,47 --> 0:37:36,0
MORE DIFFICULT THAN STUDYING ANIMAL HORMONE
ACTION. AND THERE'S


502
0:37:36,0 --> 0:37:40,68
A LOT OF ACTIVITY STILL GOING ON IN TERMS
OF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND


503
0:37:40,68 --> 0:37:46,2
HOW PLANT HORMONES OPERATE. BUT IT'S PRETTY
CLEAR THAT HORMONAL


504
0:37:46,2 --> 0:37:53,2
BALANCE IS SUPER IMPORTANT IN PLANTS. OKAY,
SO IN THE LAST FEW


505
0:37:53,2 --> 0:37:57,74
MINUTES I JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT PLANT
CHEMISTRY CAN ALSO BE


506
0:37:57,74 --> 0:38:1,9
REALLY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF PLANT DEFENSE.
AND, OF COURSE,


507
0:38:1,9 --> 0:38:5,14
PLANTS ARE IN A, A REAL BIND WHEN IT COMES
TO DEFENDING


508
0:38:5,14 --> 0:38:8,71
THEMSELVES WHEN THEY CAN'T GET UP AND MOVE.
THEY CAN'T WARD OFF


509
0:38:8,71 --> 0:38:16,42
AN ENEMY OR AN ATTACKER BY GETTING AWAY FROM
IT. SO THEY HAVE


510
0:38:16,42 --> 0:38:22,89
EVOLVED A NUMBER OF REALLY AMAZING STRATEGIES.
AND I'VE JUST


511
0:38:22,89 --> 0:38:26,75
BROKEN THESE INTO MICROBIAL ATTACK VERSUS
ATTACK OF A


512
0:38:26,75 --> 0:38:34,6
MACRO HERBIVORE. BUT IN TERMS OF SAY A BACTERIUM
OR A FUNGUS THAT


513
0:38:34,6 --> 0:38:38,97
SAY MIGHT INVADE THE TISSUE THROUGH THE STOMATA
WHICH IS AN


514
0:38:38,97 --> 0:38:42,71
OPENING, A NATURAL OPENING THAT PLANTS HAVE
TO KEEP OPEN BUT IT


515
0:38:42,71 --> 0:38:48,32
DOES MAKE THEM VULNERABLE, THE CUTICLE CAN
WARD OFF A LOT OF


516
0:38:48,32 --> 0:38:51,84
MICROBES, BUT THE STOMATES ARE ONE PLACE WHERE
THEY CAN BE


517
0:38:51,84 --> 0:38:57,33
ATTACKED. A PARTICULAR MICROBE ENTERING THROUGH
THE STOMATES


518
0:38:57,33 --> 0:39:1,27
CAN BE RECOGNIZED BY PLANTS. AND THERE ARE
PROTEINS THAT ARE


519
0:39:1,27 --> 0:39:7,77
PRODUCED BY PLANT PATHOGENS, DISEASE-CAUSING
AGENTS THAT, WHERE


520
0:39:7,77 --> 0:39:7,77



521
0:39:7,77 --> 0:39:12,14
WE HAVE ESSENTIALLY AN ARMS RACE GOING ON
BETWEEN THE ATTACKER


522
0:39:12,14 --> 0:39:16,34
AND THE PLANT IN TERMS OF THE PLANT'S ABILITY
TO RECOGNIZE THAT


523
0:39:16,34 --> 0:39:22,4
ATTACKER, SO MUCH LIKE WE DO IN TERMS OF DISEASE
RESPONSE. AND


524
0:39:22,4 --> 0:39:27,8
PLANTS, IF THEY RECOGNIZE THE ATTACKER, THEY
OFTEN HAVE A VERY


525
0:39:27,8 --> 0:39:32,24
LOCAL AND SPECIFIC RESPONSE TO THAT PARTICULAR
AGENT. AND THEY


526
0:39:32,24 --> 0:39:38,38
CAN PRODUCE A NATURAL PESTICIDE THAT WILL
BE DEADLY TO THAT


527
0:39:38,38 --> 0:39:43,72
PARTICULAR AGENT. AND AT THE SAME TIME THEY
CAN UNDERGO


528
0:39:43,72 --> 0:39:48,73
PROGRAMMED CELL DEATH IN THE REGION OF THAT
ATTACK. SO THEY CAN


529
0:39:48,73 --> 0:39:52,9
WALL OFF THAT PART OF THEIR, THEIR BODY THAT'S
BEING ATTACKED BY


530
0:39:52,9 --> 0:39:57,92
A MICROBE AND AT THE SAME TIME THAT THEY'RE
ATTACKING IT WITH A


531
0:39:57,92 --> 0:40:1,68
NATURAL PESTICIDE. SO THIS IS WHAT WE CALL
A HYPERSENSITIVE


532
0:40:1,68 --> 0:40:7,8
RESPONSE ON THE PART OF THE PLANT. OKAY, SO
THAT'S ONE WAY IN


533
0:40:7,8 --> 0:40:11,33
WHICH THEY CAN PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM MICROBES.
AND WHEN


534
0:40:11,33 --> 0:40:14,71
THEY'RE UNDERGOING AN ATTACK LIKE THAT, THIS
IS ALSO GOING TO


535
0:40:14,71 --> 0:40:19,48
RESULT IN GENERAL STIMULATION OF PLANT DEFENSE
GENES IN GENERAL,


536
0:40:19,48 --> 0:40:24,65
NOT JUST THE SPECIFIC ONES, BUT OTHER PLANT
DEFENSE GENES. AND


537
0:40:24,65 --> 0:40:27,64
THIS CAN RESULT IN PROTECTION AGAINST THE
DIVERSITY OF PATHOGENS


538
0:40:27,64 --> 0:40:30,98
THAT CAN LAST FOR A NUMBER OF DAYS. THIS IS
WHAT WE CALL


539
0:40:30,98 --> 0:40:36,28
SYSTEMIC ACQUIRED RESISTANCE BY THE PLANT.
SO WE HAVE BOTH OF


540
0:40:36,28 --> 0:40:42,85
THESE THINGS GOING ON IN THE CASE OF A MICROBIAL
ATTACK. OKAY,


541
0:40:42,85 --> 0:40:50,29
AS FAR AS HERBIVORES GO, SO BIG CHOMPING ANIMALS
FOR EXAMPLE,


542
0:40:50,29 --> 0:40:58,43
ARTHROPODS LIKE INSECTS OR MITES OR LARGER
VERTEBRATE HERBIVORES,


543
0:40:58,43 --> 0:41:1,22
THESE CAN BE WARDED OFF BY PHYSICAL DEFENSES
OF COURSE LIKE THE


544
0:41:1,22 --> 0:41:6,4
CUTICLES, SPINES, THINGS LIKE THAT, HAIRS
ON THE LEAF THAT ARE


545
0:41:6,4 --> 0:41:10,98
DIFFICULT TO, FOR AN INSECT TO PENETRATE OR
GLANDULAR EXUDATES,


546
0:41:10,98 --> 0:41:11,4



547
0:41:11,4 --> 0:41:17,8
THEY PRODUCE. BUT THOSE GLANDULAR EXUDATES
AND CHEMISTRY THAT'S


548
0:41:17,8 --> 0:41:23,24
INSIDE THE, THE LEAF OF THE PLANT CAN ALSO
BE IMPORTANT IN


549
0:41:23,24 --> 0:41:29,27
WARDING OFF HERBIVORES BY PRODUCE, THESE SUBSTANCES
WHICH ARE


550
0:41:29,27 --> 0:41:32,52
CALLED SECONDARY METABOLITES WHICH ARE JUST
BASICALLY ANY


551
0:41:32,52 --> 0:41:37,119
CHEMICAL THAT'S PRODUCED BY A PLANT THAT'S
NOT INVOLVED, THAT'S


552
0:41:37,119 --> 0:41:42,47
NOT NECESSARY FOR SURVIVAL IN REPRODUCTION
OF THE PLANT PER SE.


553
0:41:42,47 --> 0:41:46,34
THESE, THERE'S A VAST DIVERSITY OF CHEMICALS
THAT PLANTS PRODUCE


554
0:41:46,34 --> 0:41:50,74
THAT ARE NOT INVOLVED IN PRIMARY METABOLISM.
AND WHEN I WAS A


555
0:41:50,74 --> 0:41:55,45
GRAD, AN UNDERGRADUATE, THE TYPICAL PLANT
ECOLOGIST WAS


556
0:41:55,45 --> 0:41:58,42
UNWILLING TO ACCEPT THAT THESE CHEMICALS WEREN'T
JUST WASTE


557
0:41:58,42 --> 0:42:2,16
PRODUCTS. YOU KNOW PLANTS CAN'T EASILY EXCRETE
THEIR WASTE, SO


558
0:42:2,16 --> 0:42:6,82
THESE ARE JUST ACCUMULATED WASTE PRODUCTS.
BUT IT TURNS OUT


559
0:42:6,82 --> 0:42:10,58
THAT, THAT THESE CHEMICALS OFTEN HAVE A REALLY,
REALLY ARE


560
0:42:10,58 --> 0:42:16,42
IMPORTANT IN, IN WARDING OFF ATTACK BY PARTICULAR
HERBIVORES.


561
0:42:16,42 --> 0:42:22,0
THEY'RE EITHER TOXIC, DIRECTLY TOXIC TO THE
HERBIVORE OR THEY'RE


562
0:42:22,0 --> 0:42:29,23
DISTASTEFUL. AND IN GENERAL THEY'RE HARMFUL
TO THEIR ENEMIES.


563
0:42:29,23 --> 0:42:35,6
ALSO IN SOME CASES THE ACTUAL ATTACK, THE
SALIVA, FOR EXAMPLE, OF


564
0:42:35,6 --> 0:42:41,56
THE ATTACKER IS RECOGNIZED BY THE PLANT AND
THE PLANT CAN PRODUCE


565
0:42:41,56 --> 0:42:47,55
VOLATILE AIRBORNE CHEMICALS THAT WILL SIGNAL
THAT THIS ATTACKER


566
0:42:47,55 --> 0:42:54,53
IS PRESENT. AND HERE WE CAN SEE, FOR EXAMPLE,
SOME MITES THAT


567
0:42:54,53 --> 0:43:1,23
ARE ATTACKING SOME TOMATOES. VOLATILE CHEMICAL'S
PRODUCED. FOR


568
0:43:1,23 --> 0:43:4,72
EXAMPLE, HERE IS A PREDATORY MITE, PICKS UP
ON THIS VOLATILE


569
0:43:4,72 --> 0:43:10,59
CHEMICAL THAT'S CARRIED IN THE AIR AND THAT
INITIATES A RESPONSE


570
0:43:10,59 --> 0:43:14,49
ON THE PART OF THE MITE TO GO TO THE TOMATO
PLANT BECAUSE THAT'S,


571
0:43:14,49 --> 0:43:18,869
THAT'S LIKE RINGING THE FOOD BELL. MEANS THAT
THERE ARE, THERE'S


572
0:43:18,869 --> 0:43:19,3



573
0:43:19,3 --> 0:43:25,26
A TASTY ITEM ON THOSE TOMATO PLANTS, AND THE
PREDATORY MITES THEN


574
0:43:25,26 --> 0:43:28,18
COME TO THE RESCUE. SO THIS IS ESSENTIALLY
LIKE A CHEMICAL CALL


575
0:43:28,18 --> 0:43:32,48
FOR HELP BY THE PLANT. OF COURSE, THE PREDATORY
MITE DOESN'T


576
0:43:32,48 --> 0:43:37,2
REALLY HAVE ALTRUISTIC INTENTIONS TO GO TO
RESCUE THE PLANT, BUT


577
0:43:37,2 --> 0:43:41,47
IT RESCUES THE PLANT ANYWAYS BY COMING AND
EATING ITS ATTACKER.


578
0:43:41,47 --> 0:43:47,33
SO PLANTS HAVE ALL KINDS OF PHYSICAL DEFENSES,
CHEMICAL DEFENSES


579
0:43:47,33 --> 0:43:51,72
LIKE ALKALOIDS, TERPENES, AND OTHER SECONDARY
CHEMICALS THAT


580
0:43:51,72 --> 0:43:57,25
WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH THAT ARE, CAN BE HIGHLY
TOXIC TO US OR, OR


581
0:43:57,25 --> 0:44:2,1
CAN BE USEFUL IN VARIOUS WAYS. AND THEY EVEN
CAN BASICALLY


582
0:44:2,1 --> 0:44:5,89
BRING ON AN ATTACKER. THEY CAN WARN NEIGHBORING
PLANTS ABOUT


583
0:44:5,89 --> 0:44:13,869
THE PRESENCE OF AN ATTACKER THAT CAN ALSO
HELP WITH REGARD TO,


584
0:44:13,869 --> 0:44:17,49
WITH, FOR EXAMPLE, SIGNALING CLOSE RELATIVES
OF THE PRESENCE OF


585
0:44:17,49 --> 0:44:23,24
AN ATTACKER. SO PLANTS DO A LOT OF AMAZING
THINGS. AND I HOPE


586
0:44:23,24 --> 0:44:28,54
THAT THIS PART OF THE COURSE HAS BEEN INTERESTING
TO YOU. AND


587
0:44:28,54 --> 0:44:32,14
IF DO YOU HAVE MORE INTEREST IN LEARNING MORE
ABOUT PLANT AND


588
0:44:32,14 --> 0:44:36,88
FUNGAL DIVERSITY OR ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,
THERE'S A LOT OF


589
0:44:36,88 --> 0:44:40,5
COURSES OFFERED HERE AT CAL BECAUSE WE HAVE
THE NATURAL HISTORY


590
0:44:40,5 --> 0:44:44,6
MUSEUMS. THERE ARE A LOT OF FACULTY HERE THAT
STUDY ORGANISMS


591
0:44:44,6 --> 0:44:46,6
OF GREAT DIVERSITY. AND THESE ARE JUST A FEW
OF THE COURSES


592
0:44:46,6 --> 0:44:51,75
THAT, ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND THE OTHER INSTRUCTORS,
I WANT TO


593
0:44:51,75 --> 0:44:56,38
STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER TAKING
AFTER YOU PASS THIS


594
0:44:56,38 --> 0:45:0,44
COURSE WHICH WILL, IS THE MAJOR PREREQUISITE
FOR, FOR MOST OF


595
0:45:0,44 --> 0:45:4,18
THESE COURSES. SO IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE HAVING
YOU IN THE COURSE


596
0:45:4,18 --> 0:45:7,81
AND GOOD LUCK WITH STUDYING. HOPE TO SEE YOU
WEDNESDAY.


597
0:45:7,81 --> 0:47:7,81
[APPLAUSE]. THANKS.
