###0 Let's talk a little bit about the structure of the cell.
###3 I've done a lot of videos where we deal with things that
###6 go on inside of them, but I haven't done one where we just
###8 talk about the entire structure of them.
###10 So a good place to start is-- let me just draw the membrane.
###14 And the cellular membrane is a good place to start because
###17 this is what separates the cell from the outside world,
###20 and to a large degree, it kind of defines the cell.
###24 It defines it as this very, very small compartment.
###27 That's where the word, "cell" came from.
###29 So let me label that.
###30 Cellular membrane.
###35 And all cells have a cellular membrane.
###39 Now if we think about maybe the most important thing that
###45 defines a cell, you've probably seen in the DNA
###48 videos and we're going to talk about translation and
###50 transcription and all of that, that what defines what a
###53 living organism is, is its DNA.
###55 So all cells have DNA inside of it.
###57 And I won't go into the details of how DNA defines
###60 what an organism is.
###61 I've done that in some detail on the DNA videos.
###63 But all cells have DNA.
###65 This is more of an anatomy of a cell video than necessarily
###69 the function, but we'll go into the function because we
###71 need to know what these different parts do.
###72 So this is, right here, this is the DNA.
###76 And it's in its chromatin form here.
###78 There's also little proteins here.
###81 Not in all organisms, but we're going to stick to
###83 eukaryotes, and I'll talk a little bit about the
###85 difference between eukaryotes and prokaryotes in a second.
###88 But we have DNA.
###89 As I've drawn this cell right now, this is pretty much any
###93 cell, and any animal or plant or whatever kingdom
###97 could look like this.
###98 I haven't drawn a lot of the details.
###100 I've just drawn the DNA and the cellular membrane.
###103 Now here's kind of the first major division in the living
###107 world, or at least from our point of view, or it seemed
###112 obvious, is that some cells have a
###114 membrane around the DNA.
###118 So they'll have a membrane around the DNA that separates
###121 the DNA and the chromatin and everything that makes up the
###125 stuff within the DNA, separates that from the rest
###128 of the cell, and this is called a nucleus.
###131 This is called a nucleus.
###134 And I said that's a major division because when some
###137 people looked at some cells and they saw a nucleus and
###139 other cells and they didn't see a nucleus, they said, hey,
###141 this is a good way to classify organisms. So they called the
###145 things that had nucleuses, eukaryotes.
###147 
###150 These have a nucleus.
###152 So as I've drawn this cell right here, it is a eukaryote.
###156 Now, if you do not have a nucleus, you are dealing with
###160 a prokaryote.
###161 
###164 No nucleus.
###168 And examples of prokaryotes, the two big groups of them,
###172 are bacteria and Archaea.
###177 Now, Archaea are really interesting.
###178 We know very little about them.
###180 They were originally thought to be types of bacteria, but
###184 now people are realizing that they're this whole completely
###186 other group, and we've actually observed a very small
###190 subset of them, so it's a very fascinating group.
###193 And it actually turns out that, evolutionarily speaking,
###196 you shouldn't make this division first. It actually
###198 makes more sense to divide things into eukaryotes, I'll
###201 just write that Euk, bacteria and Archaea.
###207 You don't want to do this division first. There are
###209 actually three separate groups that you want
###211 to start off with.
###213 We'll talk more about this in future videos.
###215 But if you want to say who has a nucleus?
###217 Well, eukaryotes have a nucleus by definition.
###220 Who does not have a nucleus?
###221 Well, the bacteria and the Archaea do not have nuclei,
###226 just like that.
###226 But I'm going to focus on eukaryotes because they tend
###229 to be a little bit more complex.
###231 They tend to be larger.
###233 And most of what we talk about, at least in the videos
###235 so far, are dealing with eukaryotes.
###237 Eukaryotes include plants, animals-- we're animals, at
###242 least I am-- animals and fungi, and there are other
###248 groups within eukaryotes, but these are the ones that we
###251 normally deal with in our everyday world.
###254 But let's go back to looking at the anatomy of the cell.
###256 So we have our DNA.
###258 We know that it gets transcribed into mRNA, That
###261 mRNA leaves the nucleus, and it gets translated into
###269 proteins at the ribosomes.
###272 So the ribosomes are these little complexes that could be
###276 floating all over the cell, and we'll see in a second that
###278 they can also be attached to these other membrane
###281 structures.
###282 So this is a ribosome.
###283 
###287 And if all this talk of DNA transcription into mRNA and
###291 mRNA leaving the nucleus and traveling to the ribosome to
###295 be translated into proteins makes no sense to you, there
###298 are several videos where I go into that in detail.
###300 But what I want to do is just focus on all of the different
###302 parts to kind of give a big picture of things.
###304 So ribosomes are where mRNA that gets transcribed inside
###311 the nucleus from DNA, where it gets translated into proteins.
###318 So you can kind of view them as the place where information
###321 actually turns into proteins, which then can be used
###324 anywhere else in the cell.
###327 And these ribosomes, they're made up of proteins, and
###330 actually they're made up RNA.
###333 And so one question is, well, where are the pieces of the
###336 ribosomes made?
###337 Well, some are made by proteins, which might be made
###339 in other ribosomes.
###340 But some of it, the mRNA, ribosomes, you can kind of
###343 view them as this big mess, if you were to
###346 look at it in detail.
###347 There's some protein there.
###349 And I'm not drawing it that realistically, but then you
###351 have some mRNA tied in with the protein, and the mRNA
###355 isn't used for actual information purposes like it
###358 normally is when it goes from DNA to the ribosome.
###361 Within the ribosome itself, ribosomal RNA is actually used
###365 as part of the structure.
###366 It actually helps the ribosome function as a ribosome.
###370 So it's actually part of the ribosome.
###372 And all of that gets built in a part of the nucleus called
###380 the nucleolus or the nucleole.
###382 Let me write that down.
###386 So this right here, this is interesting right here.
###388 This is the nucleolus or the nucleole.
###394 And it isn't a separate organelle, and it's not
###396 separated by a membrane, but it shows up in a microscope.
###399 So when people first saw it, they said, hey, there's like a
###401 bundle there.
###401 That must be like the core of the nucleus or something.
###405 But it turns out what it is, it's the densely packed--
###407 you've got DNA and RNA, and that's actually where the
###410 ribosomal RNA, the stuff that makes up the ribosomes, is
###414 actually produced.
###415 But it's so dense that it shows up on a microscope, and
###417 that's why people decided to name it something different.
###420 But it is not membrane bound.
###421 It's not an organelle within an organelle.
###423 It's just densely packed proteins and ribosomal RNA,
###428 and it's where ribosomal RNA gets produced.
###431 So anyway, we're at the ribosome.
###433 That's where proteins get produced.
###435 But if the ribosomes are just floating around, if they're
###438 free ribosomes, then those proteins will just-- once
###441 they're produced at the ribosome, they'll just float
###443 around here in the fluid inside the cell
###445 that we call cytosol.
###446 
###449 But what if we wanted to produce proteins that are
###452 supposed to end up, maybe in the membrane of the cell, or
###456 maybe outside of the cell itself?
###459 Cells produce things that are used by other cells, that are
###461 used by the rest of the body.
###463 And here we have to go to proteins that are attached to
###467 this membrane.
###468 You can kind of view it as a bunch of tunnels.
###470 Let me see how well I can draw that.
###472 I'm going to draw it very roughly.
###475 You have this thing called the endoplasmic reticulum.
###478 Endoplasmic reticulum.
###479 
###481 You can just view it as a bunch of tunnels like that.
###486 Endoplasmic reticulum.
###487 
###489 And they eventually lead to something called Golgi bodies,
###493 named after Mr. Golgi himself.
###495 So I'll do the endoplasmic reticulum in yellow and I'll
###498 do the Golgi bodies in green maybe, just like that.
###503 I'll tell you in a second what they are.
###505 So what's going on?
###506 This is kind of a big kind of stack, or you can kind of view
###510 it as a bunch of folded membranes together.
###512 And some ribosomes are actually attached to this
###516 part, which I call the endoplasmic reticulum.
###518 So we have ribosomes attached.
###522 Some of them are free, some of them are attached.
###525 And let me write my labels down.
###527 So this right here, and we use the space over here, this big
###531 flap of convoluted membrane, that's
###535 the endoplasmic reticulum.
###536 
###542 It's fun to say.
###544 Endoplasmic reticulum.
###545 Maybe a good name for a band.
###548 Endoplasmic reticulum, and the parts that have ribosomes
###551 attached to it are called the rough endoplasmic reticulum.
###554 Maybe even a better name for a band.
###557 So right here, where I have attached ribosomes, so these
###561 ribosomes are attached right here, this is the rough
###564 endoplasmic reticulum, or maybe the rough ER.
###568 The rough ER, ER standing for endoplasmic reticulum.
###575 And then where we don't have any ribosomes attached, that's
###578 the smooth endoplasmic reticulum.
###581 So right here, that is this smooth endoplasmic reticulum.
###588 And I'm going to tell you in a second what this is, but we
###590 can keep following the membranes.
###591 Eventually we get the Golgi bodies.
###593 
###597 And what happens is, I gave you a hint.
###599 In our free ribosomes, mRNA gets there, gets translated
###602 into proteins, and the proteins then just float
###604 around in the cytosol.
###606 But what if we want proteins that should end up in
###608 membranes or that end up outside of the cell?
###611 And that's where the endoplasmic reticulum and the
###614 Golgi bodies come into play.
###615 Because now what we can do is, we have mRNA coming outside of
###620 the nucleus, and it can attach to the ribosomes or it can be
###624 translated by the ribosomes in the rough ER.
###627 And what happens here is your mRNA comes here and it's
###630 getting-- and I drew that arrow very small-- it's
###632 getting translated on the outside of the endoplasmic
###634 reticulum, but as the protein gets produced, it's getting
###638 pushed into the inside of the endoplasmic reticulum.
###642 And when I say the inside of the endoplasmic reticulum, I'm
###644 talking about this area.
###646 I'm coloring it in.
###647 This is the inside of the endoplasmic reticulum.
###651 And so the proteins will get pushed into
###653 the endoplasmic reticulum.
###654 The ones that are to be used outside of the cytosol,
###657 outside of the cell or maybe in the cell's membrane.
###659 So proteins will end up here.
###661 That's why those ribosomes are on the membrane, because they
###664 can translate things that are outside of the endoplasmic
###666 reticulum, but as the proteins get produced, the amino acid
###671 chain ends up inside of it.
###673 Let me make a blow-up of that because I
###676 think that'll be useful.
###678 So let me draw-- let's say this is the membrane of the
###683 endoplasmic reticulum and then you have
###686 ribosomes attached to it.
###689 Let's say that's a ribosome on the endoplasmic reticulum.
###692 And is this is going to be the rough endoplasmic reticulum.
###695 And what you can have is mRNA coming into one side of it.
###699 
###703 mRNA can kind of come in through here.
###706 Maybe it's going in that direction.
###708 It's getting translated into the proteins.
###711 But then the protein, as the amino acid chain is built up,
###714 will pop out on this end of the membrane.
###717 Remember, this is our membrane of our endoplasmic reticulum.
###720 So even though the mRNA is on the outside, because the
###723 ribosome is attached to it, the protein can
###725 show up on the inside.
###726 So once the protein is built, maybe then it folds all up,
###729 you know, a protein is just a folded chain of amino acids,
###733 it can travel through the endoplasmic reticulum.
###736 And it travels through it.
###737 It travels through the smooth endoplasmic reticulum all the
###741 way until it gets to the Golgi bodies.
###742 And all sorts of other things happen.
###743 I'm oversimplifying things, but I just want to give you a
###746 sense of what everything in the cell does.
###748 And once the protein travels to the Golgi bodies and they
###751 get ready for traveling outside of the cell, or maybe
###755 traveling to the cell's membrane, they'll actually bud
###758 out of the Golgi bodies.
###759 So let's say this same protein, when it gets to the
###762 Golgi bodies-- remember it's inside of the Golgi body, so
###765 let me draw the membrane of the Golgi body right there.
###768 The protein might end up there.
###770 It's just a big chain of amino acids.
###772 And then it will bud out.
###774 So let's say it looks like that, and then maybe the next
###776 step it will look something like.
###779 It will look like that.
###780 
###787 And the very next step, you could imagine, will look
###789 something like this, where it's actually completely
###791 budded out.
###792 It's popped out a little of the membrane of the
###795 Golgi body with it.
###798 So now the protein is surrounded by
###800 its own little membrane.
###802 So let's think about what happened.
###804 We had DNA transcribed into mRNA.
###807 mRNA goes to a ribosome that's attached to
###810 the endoplasmic reticulum.
###812 It is translated into a protein that travels through
###815 the endoplasmic reticulum.
###817 First, the rough, where all the ribosomes
###819 are, then this smooth.
###820 The smooth has other functions.
###821 It also helps produce hormones and other fatty compounds, but
###828 I won't go into detail there.
###829 But it just travels.
###830 It connects to the Golgi bodies.
###833 Then the Golgi bodies, the proteins can bud off and take
###836 a little bit of the membrane with it.
###838 And this idea of something being surrounded by a membrane
###841 and just traveling in the cell, so maybe the protein now
###844 looks like this.
###846 I'm enlarging it.
###846 Maybe the protein is there and then it took a little bit of
###849 the Golgi body membrane with it.
###852 This is called a vesicle.
###854 And this right here, let's add another one right here.
###857 I'm just doing that to label it.
###859 That's called a vesicle.
###863 And a vesicle is really just a very general term for
###866 anything, little small things, mostly proteins, in the cell
###870 that are just floating around, that are surrounded by their
###872 own little mini-membranes.
###874 And the reason why this mini-membrane is useful is now
###876 this protein can now float to the outer
###879 membrane of the cell.
###880 It can also float to other parts of the cell.
###882 I'm doing a simplification.
###883 And then it can merge either with the membrane of the cell,
###887 or it can use this membrane, this little vesicle membrane
###890 it has, to facilitate it getting out of the cell.
###894 You can imagine that it eventually, you know this
###896 thing-- let's say this is the outer membrane of the cell.
###900 And I'm doing a gross oversimplification.
###902 I'm not even drawing the bilipid layer.
###904 But just to have a visual impression of what it might
###907 look like, that's the vesicle there, the little protein
###911 inside of it, and it gets closer and closer to the
###914 membrane, and then it can merge with the membrane
###918 because it's made up of the same stuff.
###920 It merges with the membrane, your protein inside.
###924 I switched colors arbitrarily.
###926 But now, all of a sudden, once it merges with the membrane,
###928 then the protein can exit the actual cell, or maybe it can
###931 actually embed itself within this membrane, within the
###935 outer cellular membrane, which I drew very thin, but it has
###939 two layers to it.
###939 And we'll talk more about that.
###940 And I could probably make a whole video on it.
###944 So those are-- we've already made pretty good progress on
###947 showing the anatomy of the cell.
###949 There are a few other things we can throw in there.
###952 There are things called lysosomes, which exist in
###958 animal cells that contain enzymes in them that help
###963 dissolve other things.
###965 
###968 So if a lysosome attaches to something else and is able to
###972 spew its enzymes into it, it usually kills it.
###974 It usually digests it.
###976 So that's what a lysosome does.
###978 In plants, you have things called lytic vacuoles, and
###983 those are really the same thing as a lysosome in terms
###985 of their function in that they're really big vesicles.
###988 In fact, in general, a vacuole is just a big vesicle.
###991 It's just a general term for a big membrane-bound organelle.
###996 Vacuole.
###998 And once again, what's an organelle?
###1000 Let me write down that word.
###1002 Organelle.
###1004 It's just a membrane-bound subunit of a cell.
###1008 Just like my liver is a subunit of Sal and it's an
###1011 organ, an organelle is a subunit of a cell.
###1015 So a vacuole is just a general term for a membrane-bound
###1019 organelle that stores stuff inside of our cells.
###1022 
###1025 So a lytic vacuole would be a vacuole in a plant cell that
###1028 stores a bunch of enzymes, and if it were attached to
###1030 something else it would dissolve it if it were able to
###1032 spew its enzymes into the other thing.
###1036 Now, there's several organelles that we've talked
###1039 about within the context of respiration and
###1041 photosynthesis, and I go into detail in those videos.
###1044 But we have things called mitochondria.
###1048 Mitochondrion cells.
###1050 And they have inner and outer membranes, and this is where
###1053 we produce our energy, where sugars are turned into ATP.
###1058 I've done detailed videos on this.
###1060 These actually contain their own DNA, and they can actually
###1063 reproduce on their own, which makes people believe that they
###1070 exist-- that their ancestors once existed as independent
###1074 prokaryotic organisms, that at some point they just kind of
###1079 stumbled upon the notion of, hey, why don't I live inside
###1083 of other organisms and kind of live in symbiosis?
###1086 So mitochondria, these are organelles that at one time
###1091 their ancestors might have been independent prokaryotes.
###1093 
###1097 Mitochondria.
###1099 That's where cellular respiration takes part, and we
###1102 go into detail on that.
###1103 And then on the plant cells, this is only in-- well,
###1106 definitely not in animal cells-- you have chloroplasts,
###1109 which are a subset of things called plastids, but
###1111 chloroplasts are the most famous.
###1113 Maybe I should do that in especially green, green.
###1117 So we have chloroplasts.
###1118 And we know they have little thylakoids in there.
###1119 This is where photosynthesis takes place.
###1121 You have your grana and all of that.
###1123 And I do go into detail in the photosynthesis videos, but
###1125 it's good to know.
###1126 These are other organelles.
###1128 And just like mitochondria, they have their own DNA and
###1131 their own ribosomes.
###1133 And so the belief is that they were once independent
###1136 prokaryotes that learned to live in symbiosis inside of
###1141 larger eukaryotic cells.
###1144 So we're almost done, really, with the structure cells.
###1146 There's other things we can throw on here.
###1148 If we're dealing with plant cells or non-animal cells,
###1152 we'll have something called a cell wall, which will give
###1155 some strength to the outer membrane.
###1157 You can kind of view it that way, or it
###1159 gives it some rigidity.
###1161 So you have things called cell walls, although they're not
###1163 necessarily completely rigid.
###1165 You can almost view them as balloons that provide just a
###1167 little bit more rigidity.
###1169 Things like wood actually have double cell walls for really
###1172 hard-core rigidity.
###1173 So this is a cell wall.
###1177 This is in non-animals.
###1179 And in plants it's made out of cellulose, not cellulite.
###1183 That used to confuse me.
###1184 So this gives extra rigidity or form to
###1187 the cellular membrane.
###1189 And then to actually give the cell its actual structure, you
###1193 have these things called microfilaments, or sometimes
###1196 actin filaments, and these are these little pipes that go
###1198 throughout the cell.
###1200 These actually help give the cell its actual structure in
###1203 three dimensions, and actually, they can participate
###1205 in things moving around within the cell or even the cell
###1208 moving around itself.
###1209 And just to be complete and make sure we're covering
###1211 everything, if you watch the mitosis and meiosis videos,
###1215 you have these things called centrioles.
###1218 I go into detail there.
###1219 Centrioles that are right outside of the nucleus.
###1224 Two centrioles that are at right angles to each other
###1228 make up a centrosome, and they kind of coordinate the
###1232 microtubules when we start splitting the cells in mitosis
###1236 and meiosis.
###1237 I won't go into detail there.
###1238 I've done many videos on that as well.
###1240 But so far, this is pretty much everything you need to
###1242 know-- or at least a first overview-- of the
###1246 structure of the cell.
###1248 And in one video, we finally got it all in one place.
###1250 This is pretty much-- I haven't delved into detail on
###1254 everything-- on all of the major pieces of the cell.
###1257 So hopefully, you have a better big-picture view of how
###1260 things are organized inside of it.
