###82 succulent and tasty and wonderful
###85 if you haven't uh... tasted a lot of things in their natural state
###90 being run right out and do it because it's great i mean it's really fantastic
###95 and it's efficient so many people miss out on that because the so-called
###99 convenience foods
###101 because i get up which should go i guess change considerably in the past
###104 twenty five years
###106 until nineteen fifty we had essentially in agriculture and food supply that is a
###110 situation where
###112 who has grown by the farmer taken to the uh...
###116 boats
###117 unchanged by the housewife
###120 and cook and bake this for a family
###123 since nineteen fifty and increasingly since nineteen sixty
###127 that we have given up
###128 they all week
###130 bush come to us
###132 and industrial food supplies that is one where foods were more and more processed
###137 anywhere and stayed out of the food uh... has grown being sold
###142 the food was in a sense my
###145 an entirely new
###148 made from it
###157 food itself
###158 is not a new idea
###160 new methods and processes
###162 are changing our reading habits with factory food wheels and number two okay
###176 many of the modern
###178 so-called modern
###179 are not nearly as nutritious as the old fashioned
###183 fruits and vegetables and other products we got from
###187 any of these
###188 foods are high in sugar
###189 clients office
###191 the number of cases nutrients have been removed from
###196 when he had this up the nutritional
###199 of the american diet
###200 has actually deteriorated in recent years things are getting worse
###209 today so we can buy good for them
###211 our diets are worse than they were ten years ago
###215 too many of us have health problems because we need for me
###218 too many non nutritious foods
###220 too few vitamins and minerals
###224 this bad but i'm making right now is made
###228 with whole wheat flour
###230 which is just elf
###231 stone ground and honey and milk and synthetic meecham
###236 so if you know they will be a good but i mean you will not only taste really
###240 delicious but they were ruby
###242 a really useful and good
###245 white bread they combined store white leading maker so far we find in a white
###250 flowers have that we can we moved in branding moved
###254 is
###255 almost entirely starch
###260 as food is processed
###262 nutrients are usually removed
###265 knowing of green is a glaring example
###268 most of the minerals and vitamins and all week colonel are on the surface
###272 from the brannon outer layers
###274 and in the growing center calm creature
###277 flour made from the complete week colonel
###280 all week long
###281 contains these nutritious parts of the week
###285 but most lowered his ground
###288 to make whitewater
###290 making quite plan or the week german brand are removed
###293 and the major portions of many minerals inside a man's are lost
###297 part of the protein and most of the fiber are also lost
###304 brannon outer layers are sold for cattle
###307 and i will emerge
###321 blue bread company makes quite bridge
###323 they put back a few of the lawsuit
###332 hand-held of some of the british
###335 because it is in rich
###337 okay jumps
###338 seven ridge st contains only a few of the original message
###343 happily you don't have to buy white
###346 most stores have a
###347 variety of nutritious whole grain bread
###353 supposed to be
###356 fleets to fight by
###359 if i can't fake anything else
###363 but i thought we'd
###364 we have a very good
###369 he get at least read like this
###371 getting more vitamins and more efficient
###375 uh... white bread
###383 many states don't even required in richmond for some power crowd
###387 nutritional loss from snacks pastries and doughnuts maybe almost total
###398 rice is another one of the range from which we managed to remove most of the
###402 nutritious elements
###403 by taking off the outer layers
###407 enriched quite rise has had several vitamins and iron restored
###413 but brown rice
###414 whole grain rice that has not been mailed
###416 has all the original nutrients
###419 the rights which advertisers urgency
###422 is even less nutritious than white rice
###425 after making instant prize
###427 food companies who tend to make up for the loss of nutrients
###430 by dusting the grains with the vitamin up
###434 such highly processed foods are increasingly replacing more nutritious
###438 foods and i've died i'd like it might look like
###441 my colleague hamburger helper thing
###443 right there were only an outback
###449 larry when i get home from work what am i gonna do it if cooked up five minute
###452 becky everybody in that
###454 created by fabricate spirit and stuff we would like to fix up might think that it
###458 in a long-running polly was alright
###461 sapo doesn't
###462 it goes over possible long-term consequences to i don't think they have
###466 more we are hang on to do
###469 daily on bruce's foods and the less we did that would supply debated by all the
###473 voices foods that it would be for us
###484 not only good for you but
###485 fantastically delicious
###487 you can be great to eat and that's the thing about whole grains is that there
###491 are always
###492 not only much much better for you in grains that are tampered with but
###496 always without exception much more delicious
###499 we you know what was wrong
###509 sodium content
###511 sat over the
###514 facility in sterile school lacked away
###518 lacked the light
###521 killian
###523 tomorrow morning for a which arrives
###527 cry potassium
###529 prostrate
###530 slowly along with the shift in the last twenty years highly refined and
###534 processed foods
###536 there's been an enormous increase in the use of food additives
###542 a typical instant mashed potato package s potatoes
###545 but also these ingredients day
###552 breakfast cake as trigger for water and shortening
###556 but also ca
###565 a package salad dressing as all these ingredients
###569 xx
###576 their diets
###577 but first bleach is amal suppliers preservatives flavors morse directions
###582 and so forth
###585 doesn't have a little bit earlier today
###592 one reason companies like to use these attitudes
###595 is because it helps sales and profits
###598 using preservatives mall suppliers and stabilizers food manufacturers can
###603 concoct completely new products like putting caps
###608 bheji mph thier added to potato chips
###611 so packages can sit on the shelf for three months without going straight
###616 artificial flavors are used in ice cream
###619 because they are much cheaper than natural flavors
###623 caramel coloring makes white bread looked like whole wheat bread
###629 egg bread is dyed yellow to make it look rich in eggs
###633 and a frozen breakfast drink imitates real orange juice with the aid of an
###636 orange dot
###639 it's all imitation of the real work right
###642 and there's nothing
###643 you know that's is versions of beautiful finely is the real thing
###660 there's controversy over the use of some attitudes however
###664 because they're potentially dangerous to our help
###668 it's not necessarily the case that attitudes are always bear
###670 that certainly isn't
###672 but many attitude survey useful purposes
###675 for instance the addition of vitamin
###678 is is very useful
###679 it getting high tax office has been very useful in preventing
###685 we have to be very careful about attitudes
###687 because the turns out that anyone additive
###691 very dangerous
###692 that could mean higher
###693 a tremendous number of people
###696 and down through the years many additives
###698 and found to be dangerous
###700 most of these is an artificial colors
###702 so i think if there's any
###704 any worry we should be worrying about artificial colors
###707 they've been found to cause allergic reactions
###711 and damage of several
###713 uh... internal organs like liver and heart
###718 one controversy or who died that was once widely used
###722 is red number two
###724 it was the most common of all food items
###727 all of us consumed it
###729 yet it has now been banned because it was found to be dangerous to our help
###734 other red does have been substituted for it
###738 hundreds of foods are colored with red dot
###741 the does make them look good
###743 they help sales
###745 a
###750 it
###753 boone
###761 right
###764 right
###768 there are other evidence which are also controversy
###772 political opponents comic
###776 in small print you'll find the words sodium nitrite this is one of the
###779 attitudes
###780 to stay away from
###781 sodium nitrite itself wasn't so great
###784 problem arises
###785 went sodium nitrite reacts with other chemicals either in the
###789 a radar summary
###790 to create nitrosamines
###793 tiny amounts of nitrosamines
###795 have been found to cause cancer in animals
###799 food processors say sodium nitrite is needed for tearing me
###803 and to prevent botulism bacteria from growing
###807 off limits you simply to give meets a bright pinkish color to increase their
###811 sales appeal
###813 many scientists and others think it should be banned for this purpose
###819 one place where it is definitely unnecessary is invading
###826 a few years ago another added mono sodium gluconate m_s_g_
###830 was widely used in baby foods
###833 the purpose was to increase sales by making the food more tasty to mothers
###837 when doubts arose about the safety of the mystery for babies
###841 the manufacturers fought against removing
###844 eventually they were forced to
###846 there was no need for to have been there in the first place
###852 each have a stake in an average of five pounds of that it is a year
###855 some clearly serve no legitimate need and should be eliminated from our food
###861 we need to be very carefully and i think they've been dignity
###865 indefinite multiplication
###867 of any busy now put you brian we have more than two thousand now
###872 on the other end today in the morning discriminatory act
###875 it is that you be ignorant of the fact that in some cases they increase rylan
###880 decrease the safety of the food supply
###887 still another change in our reading habits as the high percentage of sugar
###890 in our diet
###891 by eating a lot of sugar we invite tooth decay and other health problems
###896 yet many of us have a sweet tooth and food processors are happy to encourage
###901 it
###903 why don't they
###903 keep out the email i promise you that they have been in that because their
###906 statements
###907 secure again
###908 hidden instead
###910 had something terrible and tragic accident and tomato crop
###914 their father security and feel
###917 incident this property is right kidney have civilian week about a hundred and
###924 and parking around
###927 secured and year replace them
###930 tonight since i'm not a shipping is officially and beverages
###942 a twelve ounce bottle of america's favorite soft drink
###945 has seven
###950 nine teaspoons of sugar
###955 americans are on the sugar drink bench
###957 week annually consume more sugar drinks than milk and fruit juices combined
###965 peaches or do dessert
###967 when they're packed in a heavy syrup you get forty spoons of sugar per serving
###975 in many cases we have substituted sugar based products for more nutritious wants
###980 artificially colored and flavored breakfast ranks
###983 have not only more sugar
###984 but fewer vitamins and none of the minerals that real fruit juices hair
###991 ingredients in food are listed in order by weight
###994 if shivers first it means it's the largest items
###1028 some breakfast cereals are almost fifty percent
###1033 i like
###1036 contract yet
###1038 shantytowns
###1042 carey's here
###1044 i don't do this
###1046 they didn't report
###1049 we need to use headed to note
###1052 are likely to gamble
###1058 yeah i think if you could say that i'm typing doing now
###1068 pressured rock break that you can
###1075 cabinet
###1078 can
###1081 hahha
###1082 very tasty
###1083 who can't laugh at satisfied because like it can see that had sent a c
###1088 and if there's settlements that they get the first debate
###1091 an intent to santa monica and i think talk about
###1094 i've turned into a fight with supply and trying to improve are provided
###1101 have come out of typing media
###1104 uh... kibuye these products frank
###1109 to again today saying its considerable means about one and a half billion
###1113 dollars on media about
###1115 three billion dollars both though
###1118 packets is a very different function from advertising in general
###1122 acting general advertising actin stupid increase consumption a certain goods and
###1127 then shift preference to seven brands
###1130 in the case of food however the total amount of full would you believe these
###1134 independent of the amount of advertising you see
###1137 all of the pacing does these shifts
###1140 your food supply for you putting take from one type of food to another
###1145 we can bring consumes in four different groups with nutrition declining from
###1148 group to group
###1150 and the first group would be
###1152 vegetables fruits eggs milk cheese meat
###1156 and hope we products
###1158 and the second
###1160 white bread potatoes macaroni products
###1162 some of the better breakfast cereals
###1164 and soups
###1166 and the third
###1167 and now a nutritional value is going down rapidly
###1170 suru coated breakfast cereals some snack foods
###1173 cake mixes and so forth
###1175 and in the fourth
###1177 soft drinks and many snack foods
###1180 however if we hate these foods in proportion to the advertising given to
###1184 them
###1185 this is how much we might need from each group uh...
###1192 we're
###1212 within their big break down of the event that is in really the issue
###1215 tried to shift the food preferences of americans
###1219 from the better foolish to the worst foods and i'm afraid very successful at
###1223 the all the date that we have on the nutrient consumption by the american
###1228 people to show that since
###1230 nineteen fifty-five there's been a really beat deregulation
###1233 eating the food supply yes consumed and i think that the banking very
###1237 responsible
###1242 we have a choice
###1244 we can eat the factory foods that are pushed on this by advertising
###1248 or we can save money any better with more unprocessed natural foods
###1254 there
###1256 yell
###1263 aravind crowd
