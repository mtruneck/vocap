1
0:0:0,11 --> 0:0:4,69
ron paul is now meeting in ohio are
twenty three to twenty he is now second


2
0:0:4,69 --> 0:0:7,72
place in new hampshire if he is rising


3
0:0:7,72 --> 0:0:10,389
uh... tied looks really strong


4
0:0:10,389 --> 0:0:15,79
so they sent the panic it throughout
this talbot when in fact politico has an


5
0:0:15,79 --> 0:0:20,279
article titled paul panic seizes i waste
abolition


6
0:0:20,279 --> 0:0:24,14
quotes inside article ours so damning


7
0:0:24,14 --> 0:0:25,699
for what this that was friend


8
0:0:25,699 --> 0:0:30,829
thinks of outsiders like ron paul one
actually overturn their apple cart


9
0:0:30,829 --> 0:0:33,979
uh... so they talk to one republican
after another look at these closures


10
0:0:33,979 --> 0:0:35,33
becky beach


11
0:0:35,33 --> 0:0:37,34
along tomorrow republican who helped


12
0:0:37,34 --> 0:0:38,19
president


13
0:0:38,19 --> 0:0:41,56
george h_i_v_ bush and george w_ bush
she says


14
0:0:41,56 --> 0:0:46,88
it would make the caucuses mostly
irrelevant if not entirely irrelevant if


15
0:0:46,88 --> 0:0:48,21
all winners


16
0:0:48,21 --> 0:0:51,15
she continues you would have a very
damaging effect


17
0:0:51,15 --> 0:0:54,56
because i don't think he could be
elected president i'm booked iowa and


18
0:0:54,56 --> 0:0:55,93
national public unease


19
0:0:55,93 --> 0:1:0,99
wouldn't think he represents the will of
the voters


20
0:1:0,99 --> 0:1:6,12
so not only does iowa caucus become
irrelevant iran paul wins


21
0:1:6,12 --> 0:1:7,409
but she says


22
0:1:7,409 --> 0:1:10,19
that if he wins it doesn't even
represent


23
0:1:10,19 --> 0:1:13,72
feelings but the real milo bombs let
alone the nationalist


24
0:1:13,72 --> 0:1:15,509
but how can i represent them


25
0:1:15,509 --> 0:1:21,49
phillies iowa voters every trust voted
and he came in number one


26
0:1:21,49 --> 0:1:25,53
the establishment is so deathly afraid
of ron paul


27
0:1:25,53 --> 0:1:27,38
that anytime that he is


28
0:1:27,38 --> 0:1:30,149
got any advantage they want to minimize
it


29
0:1:30,149 --> 0:1:31,36
in obliterated


30
0:1:31,36 --> 0:1:33,14
firstly was coming in


31
0:1:33,14 --> 0:1:36,64
atherton some of these uh... polls is
out there like a high just a friendly


32
0:1:36,64 --> 0:1:40,7
guy comes unplugged secular make
anything of it second out doesn't count


33
0:1:40,7 --> 0:1:43,95
as ron paul is a lot of active
supporters on the ground when although i


34
0:1:43,95 --> 0:1:47,15
had a lot of actors words on another
level off at all bob i had to absorb


35
0:1:47,15 --> 0:1:47,89
llama


36
0:1:47,89 --> 0:1:50,87
broad walton irrelevant rotate


37
0:1:50,87 --> 0:1:53,55
i tell you as a hundred times over


38
0:1:53,55 --> 0:1:57,74
totally disagree with the ron paul on at
least half of those issues


39
0:1:57,74 --> 0:2:2,42
on social security on the income tax i'm
getting really part of education i don't


40
0:2:2,42 --> 0:2:3,59
agree with them


41
0:2:3,59 --> 0:2:5,81
but this is a right


42
0:2:5,81 --> 0:2:9,629
in telugu i_d_ even if he wins he will
be comes in number one


43
0:2:9,629 --> 0:2:14,729
not only is it dot calvo isn't although
on board i will cut is becoming relevant


44
0:2:14,729 --> 0:2:17,519
but that the bhosale just bali


45
0:2:17,519 --> 0:2:18,829
but do you need


46
0:2:18,829 --> 0:2:21,709
it's absurd but it goes on such as one
person


47
0:2:21,709 --> 0:2:24,139
his house speaker cried paulson


48
0:2:24,139 --> 0:2:27,67
uh... i don't think any candidate for
burning the process in that fashion


49
0:2:27,67 --> 0:2:28,94
hopes the caucuses


50
0:2:28,94 --> 0:2:33,919
in anyway referring to ron paul's
fervent supporters on the ground


51
0:2:33,919 --> 0:2:35,939
but that's about all caucuses about


52
0:2:35,939 --> 0:2:39,249
people are talking about a candidate who
shot the caucuses


53
0:2:39,249 --> 0:2:42,699
we've only been doing this for her
decades everybody knows or that's what a


54
0:2:42,699 --> 0:2:43,69
caucuses


55
0:2:43,69 --> 0:2:45,26
anytime anybody else wins


56
0:2:45,26 --> 0:2:48,62
they'd all look at that they've got a
real momentum then side people on the


57
0:2:48,62 --> 0:2:49,169
net


58
0:2:49,169 --> 0:2:53,1
all hallways in alabama won the primary
was because he does so well in iowa


59
0:2:53,1 --> 0:2:57,28
and the national presently huge stake
out a bit and i think you're right to


60
0:2:57,28 --> 0:3:1,22
now when rob was about two and i'm now
it's pervert in the process


61
0:3:1,22 --> 0:3:4,49
to actually win the caucus


62
0:3:4,49 --> 0:3:9,899
crocs are mind-blowing so uh... politico
summarized by the way a what is that new


63
0:3:9,899 --> 0:3:15,799
short version of what the republican to
do ron paul wins ignore him anyway


64
0:3:15,799 --> 0:3:18,88
if he was losing then are tempted these
one day you know right


65
0:3:18,88 --> 0:3:22,2
did just don't want him to drop off our
on call


66
0:3:22,2 --> 0:3:25,22
this is the interest in the same corrupt
politics


67
0:3:25,22 --> 0:3:28,24
that has been going on in washington
robert that's why this bothers me is


68
0:3:28,24 --> 0:3:31,95
that a panic disease not to take away
their money for their that they're black


69
0:3:31,95 --> 0:3:35,49
money they like what while we get with a
cold or money being corrupt rotblat


70
0:3:35,49 --> 0:3:37,39
let's do it


71
0:3:37,39 --> 0:3:39,79
so here is that


72
0:3:39,79 --> 0:3:42,249
governor terry branstad the governor of
iowa quote


73
0:3:42,249 --> 0:3:45,25
people had a look at who comes in second
and who comes in third


74
0:3:45,25 --> 0:3:47,18
alter christ sake


75
0:3:47,18 --> 0:3:50,54
and he continues government-run
seagram's metro because in a strong


76
0:3:50,54 --> 0:3:55,189
second it definitely helps im going to
new hampshire and other states


77
0:3:55,189 --> 0:3:58,359
what we do it that way when ron paul was
coming a second or third being the


78
0:3:58,359 --> 0:4:1,989
center of the rosy relevant iran balls
first know that what's relevant is


79
0:4:1,989 --> 0:4:4,719
coming second author


80
0:4:4,719 --> 0:4:9,129
this is a joke by his i've never seen a
joke this it grotesque


81
0:4:9,129 --> 0:4:10,68
wages and this combo


82
0:4:10,68 --> 0:4:14,1
who could possibly say who wins is
irrelevant the most important thing is


83
0:4:14,1 --> 0:4:16,529
to go that far


84
0:4:16,529 --> 0:4:18,7
piece we work


85
0:4:18,7 --> 0:4:20,769
this gifted death of ron paul


86
0:4:20,769 --> 0:4:24,479
uh... finally like in the nineteen th
paragraph of this political article


87
0:4:24,479 --> 0:4:25,71
by fire exit quote


88
0:4:25,71 --> 0:4:29,6
this is doctor paul's hands on the most
authentic principal came in the race


89
0:4:29,6 --> 0:4:31,81
might go quietly philip


90
0:4:31,81 --> 0:4:34,85
paul's campaign chairman joseph it


91
0:4:34,85 --> 0:4:39,37
outside of can appalls campaign there's
not one positive things that about the


92
0:4:39,37 --> 0:4:43,709
leading candidate in iowa from the
entire party okay


93
0:4:43,709 --> 0:4:48,61
uh... when they ask doug rosalie
republican lawyer and brent said advisor


94
0:4:48,61 --> 0:4:50,889
uh... how uh... severe old


95
0:4:50,889 --> 0:4:52,37
warned it would be appalled


96
0:4:52,37 --> 0:4:54,439
one he said it would be quote


97
0:4:54,439 --> 0:4:56,55
a moral wound


98
0:4:56,55 --> 0:5:0,449
look at how much this that was really
scared to death of ron paul


99
0:5:0,449 --> 0:5:4,449
they're like old day and the doctors
coming he's gonna throw throw over


100
0:5:4,449 --> 0:5:8,29
terrible crime said no don't you don't
get to take money anymore


101
0:5:8,29 --> 0:5:10,259
and is due to the beating of your
daughters


102
0:5:10,259 --> 0:5:14,479
reading these quotes makes me wanna
campaign for ron paul


103
0:5:14,479 --> 0:5:16,439
totally thoroughly


104
0:5:16,439 --> 0:5:19,74
and that we disagree with them i'm
probably more than fifty percent


105
0:5:19,74 --> 0:5:20,949
of his issues


106
0:5:20,949 --> 0:5:24,899
here's at ten oh one he had not done yet
i love this one


107
0:5:24,899 --> 0:5:26,8
sam clovis


108
0:5:26,8 --> 0:5:30,749
he he's a local talk shows he says i
think up all win would be devastating


109
0:5:30,749 --> 0:5:34,16
for the state of iowa and the caucus
process


110
0:5:34,16 --> 0:5:37,58
now you ready for who her clothes and
supporting us that


111
0:5:37,58 --> 0:5:39,599
rick sent or


112
0:5:39,599 --> 0:5:40,36
now that's


113
0:5:40,36 --> 0:5:41,49
you get that


114
0:5:41,49 --> 0:5:46,779
rick sendo chance of winning the overall
the national uh... into eric candidacy


115
0:5:46,779 --> 0:5:49,74
for the republicans insofar lower than
ron paul's


116
0:5:49,74 --> 0:5:53,99
so if they are excuse was all rob hall
can win over on national race for the


117
0:5:53,99 --> 0:5:57,979
republicans that's why we think it would
hurt the iowa caucuses and make them


118
0:5:57,979 --> 0:6:0,13
irrelevant if you want i will talk this


119
0:6:0,13 --> 0:6:2,299
well how could you possibly say


120
0:6:2,299 --> 0:6:5,969
that every state or wins it'll be better
now would be worth some of that logic


121
0:6:5,969 --> 0:6:8,36
because it isn't about ron paul


122
0:6:8,36 --> 0:6:11,999
effect on the highway caucuses it's
about is if


123
0:6:11,999 --> 0:6:13,62
endemic corruption


124
0:6:13,62 --> 0:6:15,39
but they're all pumped up


125
0:6:15,39 --> 0:6:18,699
though i don't know i don't think i
think your boss doctor ballpark village


126
0:6:18,699 --> 0:6:23,249
what went down that reject was ralph
corrupts sellout all patients


127
0:6:23,249 --> 0:6:25,59
mexicano people going


128
0:6:25,59 --> 0:6:29,259
repairing that running autos i think i
think it is not even god don't do it to


129
0:6:29,259 --> 0:6:31,419
us doctor weir u_n_ aid


130
0:6:31,419 --> 0:6:34,79
while you covering the process by weight


131
0:6:34,79 --> 0:6:38,99
critical finally conserve activists
hammer scott


132
0:6:38,99 --> 0:6:40,43
she's bypassed a co-chair right so she's
got it


133
0:6:40,43 --> 0:6:43,58
force in this race but nonetheless
another quote just like the others i


134
0:6:43,58 --> 0:6:45,28
think your pervasiveness


135
0:6:45,28 --> 0:6:46,689
to see the process


136
0:6:46,689 --> 0:6:47,889
hijacked


137
0:6:47,889 --> 0:6:51,759
would be a concern for those who
consider the pot or we have


138
0:6:51,759 --> 0:6:53,719
are being first-in-the-nation


139
0:6:53,719 --> 0:6:57,659
so when michelle bachman was leading the
repair polls in iowa


140
0:6:57,659 --> 0:7:1,35
it was the greatest thing in the world
and of course she deserved it


141
0:7:1,35 --> 0:7:8,71
but if ron paul wins he is hijacked the
prize process


142
0:7:8,71 --> 0:7:12,46
and still not quite there but the more i
read this stuff the more i think


143
0:7:12,46 --> 0:7:14,6
uh... you know what


144
0:7:14,6 --> 0:7:16,979
maybe some bigger chances with tucker on
for


145
0:7:16,979 --> 0:7:20,94
because of this ellison is this deathly
afraid of them he's certainly must be


146
0:7:20,94 --> 0:9:20,94
doing something right
