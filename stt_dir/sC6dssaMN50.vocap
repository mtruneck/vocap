###1 DYLAN RIEDER: I got the new Alien Workshop
###2 Warhol series for us.
###4 Those are pretty cool.
###4 Have you seen those?
###5 MALE SPEAKER: No.
###5 DYLAN RIEDER: They're sick.
###6 The Berra one's pretty good.
###7 He looks like a weirdo.
###8 
###11 There's that one.
###13 Fucking Dyrdek.
###16 You got Arto's.
###19 Grant's.
###20 
###23 Mine's the bananas.
###26 And I feel like that'll be the hot seller.
###29 Dill's.
###30 
###33 MALE SPEAKER: Dang, there's a lot of that Alien pros.
###35 DYLAN RIEDER: Yeah.
###36 I think Workshop 2, there's not really a genre.
###43 Everybody's so different.
###43 You got Heath and then AVE and then Dyrdek and a
###51 broad expand of dudes.
###54 MALE SPEAKER: Kalis.
###55 DYLAN RIEDER: Kalis.
###56 Well, now he's DGKalis.
###58 Kalis left.
###59 I'm sure he was feeling a bit like an outcast.
###62 Going on tour, I think it would just be AVE, Jake, Dill,
###66 Heath, and then Kalis.
###70 BILL STROBECK: I could see where it seemed like if Kalis
###72 felt that way, which I feel like he did, that he felt like
###75 he didn't fit in.
###76 Because Josh has been on since forever.
###80 Someone like Josh is more of a team guy.
###82 He likes to have the whole team get together.
###85 He's real about that.
###87 I felt like he didn't feel like he fit in when he was
###90 there before all those guys.
###93 They all took over, all those new kids and AVE and Dylan--
###98 and those guys.
###100 It just seemed like it was their team, kind of.
###103 
###106 JASON DILL: Workshop got divided into upriver and
###109 downriver at one point.
###110 And now that Kalis is gone, there's less upriver.
###114 Dyrdek, Mikey Taylor, Berra is so upriver.
###117 MALE SPEAKER: What does that mean?
###118 JASON DILL: They're upriver.
###120 They're where TVs exist, the internet, fishing's better.
###126 Who's in the van on tour?
###128 Who's dirty and in the streets all the time?
###131 The downriver kids.
###133 So Dylan was instantly downriver with us.
###136 As far as Dylan goes, between the time he got on the
###138 Workshop and him just being with us all the time and being
###144 so much like AVE and I, it seemed like he
###146 wasn't ever not there.
###148 
###151 ANTHONY VAN ENGELEN: He just embodies a classic, good
###154 style, gnarly, talented skater, and into just who he
###159 is and stuff.
###160 It just fit into the Workshop.
###163 Whatever.
###163 He's his own person.
###166 JASON DILL: Dylan's like me and AVE--
###167 hand tattoos, smoking cigarettes.
###169 There's so many times me and AVE looked at him and we were
###171 like, wow, look at him.
###173 He's growing up so fast.
###174 Oh, boy.
###175 And then shit gets new with him.
###178 DYLAN RIEDER: These guys are pretty tight.
###180 Burgundy loafers.
###182 They're slip-ons, kind of cool.
###185 MALE SPEAKER: These shoes are pretty infamous.
###187 DYLAN RIEDER: Yeah.
###188 I think they got a lot of talk when they came out.
###191 I definitely got some shit for them.
###193 But I fucking dig them.
###195 They're awesome.
###195 When you skate them, this red comes off.
###198 It's super thin leather, so it bleeds kind of crazy.
###205 MARK OBLOW: Well, Dylan was on Vans.
###206 And at the time, he was wearing the slip-ons.
###210 That's all he wore, slip-on, slip-on.
###212 So when we started Gravis, that was the thing was for him
###216 and Arto, it's like this was going to be their deal.
###218 And they could do whatever they wanted.
###220 It was just really like, what do you want?
###223 And that's what he wanted.
###224 Because he wanted something that when he's skating, looks
###228 like when he's walking around at night.
###231 So at the time, Dylan was super influenced by fashion
###234 and just stuff in that world.
###237 And that's where it stemmed from was not going, oh, how
###242 can we rip off the Nike Dunk again?
###247 You look at a lot of shoes.
###248 And it's sad to say, but they rip off the classics.
###252 He wanted to do something different as well.
###254 He was willing to take the risk and said, fuck it.
###257 I don't care.
###258 Because he did get a lot of heat for it.
###259 And that's a part of Dylan, too, where he is a tough kid,
###263 where you can go, fuck you.
###264 I don't care.
###265 And yeah, that's my shoe.
###266 Ha.
###267 JASON DILL: Everybody secretly wants those shoes.
###269 Did you hear the story about the enjoy team?
###272 So the enjoy team was on a tour with Joe Brook.
###275 He just told me this.
###276 And they kept talking about Dylan's shoe.
###278 And at first, it was like, [DISCONTENTED MUTTERING]
###280 who is this?
###281 Maybe not so bad, but probably something like that.
###284 And they were like, man, someone must have said,
###286 actually, I saw them.
###287 And they're fucking so comfortable and
###288 they're super sick.
###289 And I just thought, see, that's what it's about.
###293 It's about, fuck you guys.
###296 Fuck me what I think.
###299 Look at this original little fucker running around with his
###301 cute little rolled-up pants and his fucking shirts with
###303 the buttons on and a little necklace and shit.
###305 He looks great.
###306 That's what's funny.
###307 You talk about the way that Dylan dresses.
###309 Look what we're doing now, talking about Dylan.
###312 So joke's on you.
###314 You're not as good-looking as him.
###315 GREG HUNT: You should be able to dress
###316 however you want to dress.
###318 Look at how Hosoi dressed in the '80s.
###321 He was full rock star.
###323 It's all about doing your own thing.
###326 But what it really comes down to is your skating.
###329 | think he's a full skate rat.
###333 Yeah, he might wear sometimes nice clothes.
###334 He might skate in nice clothes.
###335 But dude, it's not keeping him from trying something insane
###340 and slamming for five hours till he gets something.
###343 So there's definitely a little bit of
###345 negativity towards Dylan.
###346 But that's all people who don't know him.
###349 
###352 JASON DILL: I think that the thing is, I think that the way
###353 that Dylan dresses in "Mind Field" sticks out so much.
###358 Because when it starts, you have Dylan, Vans shoe.
###362 And someone would say a normal type of that kid.
###367 Then as the video part progresses, all of a sudden,
###371 Dylan's got some fucking jeans, his little dance shoes
###377 on, and a tank top.
###378 And it's fucking great.
###381 It's like, yeah, of course.
###384 And now when you see Dylan, the look
###387 is perfectly together.
###388 I back a look big time, give a fuck.
###392 I'm always coming up with looks.
###394 I love it.
###394 But now I'm stuck in a look.
###396 I can't get out of the pulled-up socks.
###398 BILL STROBECK: The way Dylan dresses reminds me of
###401 Dill at that time.
###402 When I first met Dill, it was like, here are my fancy,
###404 fashionable shoes.
###405 And here is these pants that no one's wearing.
###409 Dill had those cut-off pants that were big and short.
###413 They were like high waters.
###414 But it had something to do with fashion.
###417 And I think that Dylan's into that.
###419 MALE SPEAKER: Do you think that Dylan
###420 takes that from Dill?
###421 BILL STROBECK: I don't think he takes it from Dill.
###423 I think that he just expresses himself in the same way that
###426 Dill did when he felt like he could be his own person.
###430 He's young.
###430 When I was that age, I had Richard Avedon CK One photos
###434 on my wall.
###435 And this is his age to do that kind of stuff.
###439 He likes model chicks.
###441 He'll grow out of that.
###442 I'd say if you could look up the words "cool breeze"
###445 online, that's the perfect explanation for Dylan.
###448 He's a cool breeze, sunglasses, and fucking
###451 sitting in the corner and not really talking to that many
###454 people, especially around that time.
###456 He was just a fucking young, mellow dude.
###459 MARK OBLOW: And that's how he's always been.
###460 And that's part of the mystique of Dylan, and even
###464 covering up in the hoodies, and all the shit is he doesn't
###467 like that attention.
###469 He doesn't like the whole pretty boy and all this stuff.
###472 And it's like, Dylan is a good-looking kid.
###474 And then because of that, he gets points taken away, you
###479 know what I mean?
###479 Where if he was fucking ugly, he would
###484 be looked at different.
###485 But he had to prove himself.
###487 JASON DILL: You can give Dylan all the shit you want.
###490 But he looks great.
###494 He's goddamn good-looking.
###496 MARK OBLOW: That's obviously, too, the big difference
###498 fucking the chicks.
###500 It's like, at his video premiere, we had that party.
###504 And it's like, you look at all the people in the crowd and
###506 all the guys.
###508 And then there's just rows of all these good-looking girls.
###511 And they're all just staring, watching the
###513 whole entire parks.
###514 And they're like, oh, he's so good, his style.
###516 He's so smooth.
###517 You're just like, fucking asshole, man.
###520 What a dick.
###521 BILL STROBECK: Dylan can get ass, man.
###523 He's confident.
###524 He's real confident.
###525 He'll fuck them and chuck them, dude.
###528 He gets some.
###530 Him and Alex both have--
###532 they're both good-looking, like fucking Johnny Depp.
###536 This one night, I went to this place, this club out in LA,
###541 and went and met Dylan.
###545 And then I look over and I'm like--
###547 Alex is getting in.
###548 He's like, hey, what's up?
###549 What's up?
###550 I was like, hey man.
###550 What are you doing?
###551 But they didn't really say hi to each other.
###555 I go, what's going on with that?
###556 And they have a nightlife beef or something.
###561 We'll see who gets the girls tonight.
###564 Usually, it's Dylan.
###567 But it's real funny.
###569 I think that girls probably think little
###571 Alex is better looking.
###574 Dylan's more like a woman.
###576 Not like a woman, but he's very pretty.
###579 And I guess little Alex is more--
###582 I don't know.
###584 He's like his dad.
###586 Except for his dad gets more ass than him.
###588 But little Alex, though, doesn't really say that much
###594 because he's kind of shy.
###595 And I think that girls are intimidated by him.
###598 So they won't go up to him.
###599 And meanwhile, he won't go up to them.
###602 
###605 Oddly enough, he ends up going home probably alone.
###607
