CARL AZUZ, HOST: If you`ve ever posted something
on Twitter an thought "I should delete that,"


2
0:0:5,46 --> 0:0:9,78
we have another reason. You might be able
to get rid of it on a Twitter feed, but someone


3
0:0:9,78 --> 0:0:12,1
else is holding onto it forever.


4
0:0:12,1 --> 0:0:18,64
The explanation`s coming up. I`m Carl Azuz.
Welcome to CNN STUDENT NEWS.


5
0:0:18,64 --> 0:0:25,64
(MUSIC PLAYING)


6
0:0:25,64 --> 0:0:33,66
AZUZ: First up: coughing, sneezing, fever,
running nose. There`s nothing unusual about


7
0:0:33,66 --> 0:0:37,97
that stuff this time of year. But if it feels
like you can`t go anywhere without seeing


8
0:0:37,97 --> 0:0:43,489
these symptoms of sickness, you might be right.
Flu season is here and from what we`re seeing,


9
0:0:43,489 --> 0:0:45,14
it`s a bad one.


10
0:0:45,14 --> 0:0:49,3
Check out this map. All those states in red,
that`s where officials are reporting widespread


11
0:0:49,3 --> 0:0:54,78
outbreaks of the flu. There are more than
40 states with that. Normally, flu season


12
0:0:54,78 --> 0:1:1,2
hits its peak around late January, early February.
By the end of December, more than 22,000 had


13
0:1:1,2 --> 0:1:6,28
checked into the hospital with flu-like symptoms.
Doctors say it`s hard to predict just how


14
0:1:6,28 --> 0:1:12,299
bad the flu season might get but some are
concerned there are so many cases this early


15
0:1:12,299 --> 0:1:13,539
in the season.


16
0:1:13,539 --> 0:1:17,99
A couple weeks ago, I sat down with CNN`s
Dr. Sanjay Gupta -- he`s our chief medical


17
0:1:17,99 --> 0:1:22,6
correspondent -- to talk about the flu. One
of the things I asked him is, "How do you


18
0:1:22,6 --> 0:1:24,79
know when you`re too sick to go to school?"


19
0:1:24,79 --> 0:1:25,209
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


20
0:1:25,209 --> 0:1:29,7
AZUZ: With what symptoms should a student
stay home? Like, you wake up, you`re not feeling


21
0:1:29,7 --> 0:1:31,909
well. At what point should you say, "I`m not
going to school"?


22
0:1:31,909 --> 0:1:34,579
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:
Fever`s going to be one of the things that`s


23
0:1:34,579 --> 0:1:40,689
going to be a hallmark. Usually when you talk
about a fever that`s above 101.3, 101.4, that


24
0:1:40,689 --> 0:1:41,979
area. That`s a true fever.


25
0:1:41,979 --> 0:1:47,24
If you have some of the classic symptoms including
sore throat but also specifically muscle aches


26
0:1:47,24 --> 0:1:50,99
are something that distinguish flu from a
regular cold. You should probably stay home


27
0:1:50,99 --> 0:1:53,149
with both. That`s one way you can tell the
difference.


28
0:1:53,149 --> 0:1:54,479
AZUZ: How effective is a flu shot?


29
0:1:54,479 --> 0:1:58,679
GUPTA: Flu shots can be very effective. You
know, there`s numbers that vary every year,


30
0:1:58,679 --> 0:2:4,409
but it`s in the 70 to 80 percent range. It`s
not 100 percent but it is pretty good and


31
0:2:4,409 --> 0:2:5,52
really the best thing that we have.


32
0:2:5,52 --> 0:2:6,229
(END VIDEO CLIP)


33
0:2:6,229 --> 0:2:10,75
AZUZ: All right, now, Dr. Gupta and I talked
about a lot more regarding the flu. We discussed


34
0:2:10,75 --> 0:2:14,77
how the flu spreads, how to keep it from spreading.
There`s something you can do and it`s pretty


35
0:2:14,77 --> 0:2:20,5
easy. Check out the interview. It`s in the
Spotlight section of our homepage, that`s


36
0:2:20,5 --> 0:2:20,61
cnnstudentnews.com.


37
0:2:20,61 --> 0:2:22,29
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


38
0:2:22,29 --> 0:2:27,59
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s shoutout goes
out to Ms. Bzdawka and the students at Achieve


39
0:2:27,59 --> 0:2:31,39
Language Academy in St. Paul, Minnesota.


40
0:2:31,39 --> 0:2:35,91
Jeannette Rankin wa the first woman elected
to what U.S. government body?


41
0:2:35,91 --> 0:2:41,47
Here we go: was it the Supreme Court? Senate?
House of Representatives? Or Joint Chiefs


42
0:2:41,47 --> 0:2:43,53
of Staff?


43
0:2:43,53 --> 0:2:48,68
You`ve got three seconds. Go.


44
0:2:48,68 --> 0:2:56,5
Rankin was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives
in 1916 and then again in 1940.


45
0:2:56,5 --> 0:2:59,67
That`s your answer and that`s your shoutout.


46
0:2:59,67 --> 0:3:1,87
(END VIDEO CLIP)


47
0:3:1,87 --> 0:3:6,52
AZUZ: When Jeanette Rankin first walked into
the Capitol as a U.S. representative, she


48
0:3:6,52 --> 0:3:12,43
certainly stood out. She was the only woman
there. If she were a member of the 113th Congress,


49
0:3:12,43 --> 0:3:15,71
the one that just started this year, she`d
have a lot more company.


50
0:3:15,71 --> 0:3:22,79
Ninety-eight women: 78 in the House, 20 in
the Senate. In fact, the Senators from California,


51
0:3:22,79 --> 0:3:27,75
New Hampshire, and Washington are all women.
That`s just part of the diversity that this


52
0:3:27,75 --> 0:3:33,25
Congress represents. With nearly 100 female
members, there are more women serving together


53
0:3:33,25 --> 0:3:36,819
in Congress now than there ever have been
before.


54
0:3:36,819 --> 0:3:44,35
The 113th Congress also includes 43 African-Americans,
31 Latinos, 12 Asian-Americans and Pacific


55
0:3:44,35 --> 0:3:50,45
Islanders. The House and Senate have 7 gay
or bisexual members. The Senate has its first


56
0:3:50,45 --> 0:3:53,87
Buddhist member. And the House has its first
member who is a Hindu.


57
0:3:53,87 --> 0:3:59,4
Some interesting former jobs among the members
of Congress as well. Five had former careers


58
0:3:59,4 --> 0:4:5,37
in professional sports. Two were physicists.
And one worked as a Santa impersonator before


59
0:4:5,37 --> 0:4:9,27
running for Congress. That might explain why
he owns six reindeer.


60
0:4:9,27 --> 0:4:11,9
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


61
0:4:11,9 --> 0:4:12,9
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See if you can ID me.


62
0:4:12,9 --> 0:4:22,9
I was established in 1800. I`m part of the
legislative branch of the U.S. government.


63
0:4:22,9 --> 0:4:30,83
I`m home to more than 150 million items, which
makes me the largest library in the world.


64
0:4:30,83 --> 0:4:38,349
I`m the Library of Congress and my collections
include a lot more than just books.


65
0:4:38,349 --> 0:4:40,629
(END VIDEO CLIP)


66
0:4:40,629 --> 0:4:45,979
AZUZ: The Library of Congress does hold more
than 34 million books, but it also collects


67
0:4:45,979 --> 0:4:52,24
recordings, photographs, maps, sheet music,
and for the past two years, tweets.


68
0:4:52,24 --> 0:4:58,9
Back in April of 2010, the Library signed
a deal with Twitter to get access to all public


69
0:4:58,9 --> 0:5:3,249
tweets since the site was founded. That means
if you tweet something and it`s public, meaning


70
0:5:3,249 --> 0:5:8,15
it`s not a direct message, the Library of
Congress is going to get it. This includes


71
0:5:8,15 --> 0:5:11,52
everything ever publicly tweeted.


72
0:5:11,52 --> 0:5:16,889
So far the Library has collected more than
170 billion tweets; millions more, as you


73
0:5:16,889 --> 0:5:22,49
might expect, roll in every day. But collecting
all these tweets is only part of the Library`s


74
0:5:22,49 --> 0:5:28,279
challenge. What it`s working on now is figuring
out a way to make all of that data available


75
0:5:28,279 --> 0:5:29,729
to the public.


76
0:5:29,729 --> 0:5:34,27
Researchers all over the world use the Library
of Congress to their work. Library officials


77
0:5:34,27 --> 0:5:39,3
say they started collecting tweets because
society was communicating more over social


78
0:5:39,3 --> 0:5:43,9
media than it was through letters or journals.


79
0:5:43,9 --> 0:5:46,84
So the Library of Congress is starting to
focus more on the digital world. Consumer


80
0:5:46,84 --> 0:5:53,349
Electronics Show has always been about technology.
This thing is the largest gadget conference


81
0:5:53,349 --> 0:5:56,62
in the world. It`s going on right now in Las
Vegas, Nevada.


82
0:5:56,62 --> 0:6:2,27
Dan Simon hit the convention early for a look
at what could be some of this year`s trends


83
0:6:2,27 --> 0:6:3,89
in technology.


84
0:6:3,89 --> 0:6:3,559
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


85
0:6:3,559 --> 0:6:7,24
DAN SIMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It`s a January
tradition here in Las Vegas as crews work


86
0:6:7,24 --> 0:6:11,449
furiously to get the booths and exhibits ready
for the start of the Consumer Electronics


87
0:6:11,449 --> 0:6:17,12
Show. More than 150,000 people are expected
to roam these vast halls the next couple of


88
0:6:17,12 --> 0:6:21,509
days to get a glimpse of the technologies
that might hit the store shelves in the coming


89
0:6:21,509 --> 0:6:22,139
year.


90
0:6:22,139 --> 0:6:28,27
TVs are always the biggest crowd-draw at CES.
Last year, the companies were pushing 3D TVs.


91
0:6:28,27 --> 0:6:32,449
They didn`t really take off with consumers.
This year, they`re hoping that a technology


92
0:6:32,449 --> 0:6:36,96
called Ultra HD will win over consumers. These
are screens that have over four times the


93
0:6:36,96 --> 0:6:41,589
resolution as a typical HD TV. But they`re
expensive. Some of these sets cost almost


94
0:6:41,589 --> 0:6:42,969
as much as a car.


95
0:6:42,969 --> 0:6:47,439
And speaking of cars, they`re becoming a bigger
deal every year at CES. This year you`ll hear


96
0:6:47,439 --> 0:6:51,77
the term "connected car" a lot. That means
using your smartphone for a lot of different


97
0:6:51,77 --> 0:6:57,4
things, including using the phone to start
the car on those especially cold winter days.


98
0:6:57,4 --> 0:7:2,229
Another big theme, home automation. Run your
home from wherever you are. This category


99
0:7:2,229 --> 0:7:6,18
used to be for people who were really wealthy.
Now these products are a lot more affordable,


100
0:7:6,18 --> 0:7:11,129
and it`s about being able to control your
lights, your thermostat, your appliances while


101
0:7:11,129 --> 0:7:11,71
on the go.


102
0:7:11,71 --> 0:7:17,36
And of course look for the latest innovations
in PCs, tablets, and cameras. More than 3000


103
0:7:17,36 --> 0:7:23,129
companies are on display here, all of them
really vying for one thing: attention.


104
0:7:23,129 --> 0:7:25,229
Dan Simon, CNN. Las Vegas.


105
0:7:25,229 --> 0:7:26,409
(END VIDEO CLIP)


106
0:7:26,409 --> 0:7:30,46
AZUZ: Well at the end of yesterday`s show,
we told you about a blog. We posted a question


107
0:7:30,46 --> 0:7:33,979
asking whether your New Year`s resolutions
were holding up.


108
0:7:33,979 --> 0:7:38,439
Marie resolved to stay in shape and not to
eat as much. She`s happy to say she`s partly


109
0:7:38,439 --> 0:7:41,159
kept it by eating right and going to the gym.


110
0:7:41,159 --> 0:7:45,819
Alex wanted to tackle procrastination. But
with homework to read a novel, that resolution


111
0:7:45,819 --> 0:7:48,5
hasn`t been holding up so well.


112
0:7:48,5 --> 0:7:52,9
Addison wants to spend more time with the
family, friends, and dog instead of video


113
0:7:52,9 --> 0:7:54,749
games. Says it`s so hard!


114
0:7:54,749 --> 0:7:59,18
Elizabeth resolves not to complain at all.
"Life is wonderful and I should be grateful


115
0:7:59,18 --> 0:8:0,669
for it," she writes.


116
0:8:0,669 --> 0:8:5,279
Bardock is committed to winning the spelling
bee. "I know I will one- hundred percent"


117
0:8:5,279 --> 0:8:7,419
and of course spelled everything right in
that post.


118
0:8:7,419 --> 0:8:13,229
Ethan didn`t make any resolutions so he has
a 100 percent success rate. OK, Ethan.


119
0:8:13,229 --> 0:8:18,9
Keisuke resolves to help people in Fukushima,
Japan, and study English to let people know


120
0:8:18,9 --> 0:8:20,259
more about Fukushima.


121
0:8:20,259 --> 0:8:23,779
Justin was working on getting another job
so he could be more independent.


122
0:8:23,779 --> 0:8:28,409
Greta wants to learn more about gymnastics
to be come a gymnastics teacher.


123
0:8:28,409 --> 0:8:33,77
And Somil and Aaron resolve to watch CNN Student
News every day and they`ve been doing it.


124
0:8:33,77 --> 0:8:37,0
I`m thinking extra credit on that.


125
0:8:37,0 --> 0:8:41,3
Before we go, we`re going to stir up the waters
a little bit. Actually, we`re going to let


126
0:8:41,3 --> 0:8:41,95
these guys do it.


127
0:8:41,95 --> 0:8:42,37
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


128
0:8:42,37 --> 0:8:45,4
AZUZ (voice-over): People on a boat in this
YouTube video were just planning on doing


129
0:8:45,4 --> 0:8:50,78
some whale watching. Instead, look at this.
They were witnesses to a stampeding pod of


130
0:8:50,78 --> 0:8:55,56
dolphins. I guess the marine animals are actually
attention hogs. We`re not sure exactly what


131
0:8:55,56 --> 0:9:0,59
caused the stampede; these dolphins aren`t
just out for a leisurely swim. It`s pretty


132
0:9:0,59 --> 0:9:2,54
obvious they`re moving with a porpoise.


133
0:9:2,54 --> 0:9:2,97
(END VIDEO CLIP)


134
0:9:2,97 --> 0:9:6,15
There`s a probably some crazy idea for why
this kind of thing happens and maybe you could


135
0:9:6,15 --> 0:9:10,32
blow holes in the theory, but there`s no reason
to make waves. After all, this kind of story


136
0:9:10,32 --> 0:9:11,46
is just fin and games.


137
0:9:11,46 --> 0:9:15,47
Remember, we`re looking for your iReports
describing Dr. Martin Luther King Jr in just


138
0:9:15,47 --> 0:9:20,14
one word. You have less than one week to get
those in. All the details in the spotlight


139
0:9:20,14 --> 0:9:21,56
at cnnstudentnews.com.


140
0:9:21,56 --> 0:11:21,56
I`m Carl Azuz. We`ll see you tomorrow.
