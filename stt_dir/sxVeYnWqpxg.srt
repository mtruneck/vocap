1
0:0:0,399 --> 0:0:4,52
Today Im in Arizona and I couldnt be happier
to be here because Im about to attend the


2
0:0:4,52 --> 0:0:7,4
Bondurant
School of High Performance Driving. And the


3
0:0:7,4 --> 0:0:9,86
coolest part of all is that my objective today
is to learn to


4
0:0:9,86 --> 0:0:28,81
tame the ZR1.


5
0:0:28,81 --> 0:0:35,61
Powered by a 6.2 liter LS9 aluminum block
V8, the ZR1 produces 638 horsepower at 6500


6
0:0:35,61 --> 0:0:40,4
RPM and 604
pound feet of torque at 3800 RPM. It can go


7
0:0:40,4 --> 0:0:43,71
from zero to sixty in 3.4 seconds and has
a top speed of


8
0:0:43,71 --> 0:0:45,69
205 miles per hour.


9
0:0:45,69 --> 0:0:49,48
Ive been trying to find a time to come out
to this school for months so when we finally


10
0:0:49,48 --> 0:0:52,24
put it in the
books I was supremely happy. But just when


11
0:0:52,24 --> 0:0:54,85
I thought I couldnt be any more jazzed, I
found out that


12
0:0:54,85 --> 0:0:57,5
my instructor was going to be Darren Law.


13
0:0:57,5 --> 0:1:1,9
Hes the only driver to have competed in every
one of the Grand Am Rolex Sports Car Series


14
0:1:1,9 --> 0:1:4,64
races
since the series started in 2000. And hes


15
0:1:4,64 --> 0:1:9,0
the 2001 Rolex Series GT champion. In 2003,
he moved into


16
0:1:9,0 --> 0:1:14,35
Daytona prototypes and posted a fourth place
finish. Since 2006, hes been racing for Brumos


17
0:1:14,35 --> 0:1:17,4
Racing
and in 2007, along with his teammate David


18
0:1:17,4 --> 0:1:21,11
Donahue, finished twelve consecutive races
in the top ten.


19
0:1:21,11 --> 0:1:25,68
Suffice it to say, Darren has spent a lot
of time at the podium and has no shortage


20
0:1:25,68 --> 0:1:27,56
of bragging rights.


21
0:1:27,56 --> 0:1:32,78
The first objective for our day was to do
the heel-toe rev-matching. It sounds pretty


22
0:1:32,78 --> 0:1:35,32
simple.
Conceptually, its not that complex, but it


23
0:1:35,32 --> 0:1:37,18
definitely takes practice to master it.


24
0:1:37,18 --> 0:1:40,5
So these revs, when you go to give it the
rev, when you put on the brake, youre gonna


25
0:1:40,5 --> 0:1:42,17
give it a rev
and youre gonna get out of there. You dont


26
0:1:42,17 --> 0:1:43,36
want to stay. You dont want to leave your
foot twisted


27
0:1:43,36 --> 0:1:50,58
and stay on the RPM. Dont be afraid to get
it up to at least 4000.


28
0:1:50,58 --> 0:1:51,38
Okay.


29
0:1:51,38 --> 0:1:53,81
There you go.


30
0:1:53,81 --> 0:1:57,909
I have particularly small feet so I had to
really come up with a maneuver and crank my


31
0:1:57,909 --> 0:2:0,0
leg so that I
could be on the gas and the brake at the same


32
0:2:0,0 --> 0:2:0,51
time.


33
0:2:0,51 --> 0:2:6,72
Clutch in. Rev it. There you go. Perfect.
Alright, that was good.


34
0:2:6,72 --> 0:2:12,159
One of my favorite things that we did all
day was when we got in the skid car and messed


35
0:2:12,159 --> 0:2:14,1
around with
understeer and oversteer.


36
0:2:14,1 --> 0:2:19,12
So understeer. Why does it happen? Youve basically
lost grip on the front of the car. You could


37
0:2:19,12 --> 0:2:27,6
possibly just be going too fast. You basically
dont have traction on the front end. Youve


38
0:2:27,6 --> 0:2:30,62
either
overloaded the front end with too much brake,


39
0:2:30,62 --> 0:2:33,45
or theres not enough braking or weight on
the front of


40
0:2:33,45 --> 0:2:34,19
the car.


41
0:2:34,19 --> 0:2:39,169
So Darren, obviously, is operating these controls
and he can lift my wheels off the ground and


42
0:2:39,169 --> 0:2:41,1
completely cause me to lose control.


43
0:2:41,1 --> 0:2:49,389
Alright, so first things first. Well do the
understeer, the front-wheel skid.


44
0:2:49,389 --> 0:2:56,879
But it gives you this awesome education on
how to recover, how to course correct and


45
0:2:56,879 --> 0:2:58,629
save your life
and other peoples lives.


46
0:2:58,629 --> 0:3:4,99
Youve got to ease in here. Ease up. Let it
get turned. There you go. Then youve got to


47
0:3:4,99 --> 0:3:7,18
come off the
throttle. Add a little brake. Wait til the


48
0:3:7,18 --> 0:3:9,349
car starts to turn a bit more. Now back on
the gas and straight


49
0:3:9,349 --> 0:3:15,45
for the line.


50
0:3:15,45 --> 0:3:20,349
After messing around with the nuances of understeer,
it was on to oversteer. So oversteer is, of


51
0:3:20,349 --> 0:3:24,9
course, the opposite. This is when you lose
control of your back end. Now, most peoples


52
0:3:24,9 --> 0:3:26,59
first impulse
is to brake but, in fact, what you need to


53
0:3:26,59 --> 0:3:29,4
do is to utilize the throttle to regain your
grip.


54
0:3:29,4 --> 0:3:30,76
This is awesome!


55
0:3:30,76 --> 0:3:32,73
Isnt this a great learning tool?


56
0:3:32,73 --> 0:3:33,209
Yeah!


57
0:3:33,209 --> 0:3:37,569
Gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas.


58
0:3:37,569 --> 0:3:40,969
Good. That was good. That was smooth.


59
0:3:40,969 --> 0:3:44,37
And then it was on to the next maneuver. Autocross!


60
0:3:44,37 --> 0:3:47,529
When you come in and you turn in the corner,
if it starts to understeer, you need to get


61
0:3:47,529 --> 0:3:49,529
out of the
throttle. If its still sliding, you have to


62
0:3:49,529 --> 0:3:52,449
ease it with a little bit of brake until the
front end starts to come


63
0:3:52,449 --> 0:3:55,76
down. Just like we did with the skid car.
And again, oversteer, if you come in and the


64
0:3:55,76 --> 0:3:57,569
back end gets
sideways, turn into it, add a little throttle.


65
0:3:57,569 --> 0:3:58,749
Not too much, this thing has so much power.
It will just light


66
0:3:58,749 --> 0:3:59,219
them up.


67
0:3:59,219 --> 0:4:5,199
Start it now.
So youll hit the brake. Youll have some understeer.


68
0:4:5,199 --> 0:4:7,18
You see how it got a little sideways?


69
0:4:7,18 --> 0:4:7,43
Yeah.


70
0:4:7,43 --> 0:4:13,12
For the sake of friendly competition, we decided
to do some loosely timed trials, so Darren


71
0:4:13,12 --> 0:4:15,139
went first.


72
0:4:15,139 --> 0:4:18,68
Okay, stop!


73
0:4:18,68 --> 0:4:20,449
53.4


74
0:4:20,449 --> 0:4:21,539
And then it was my turn.


75
0:4:21,539 --> 0:4:27,24
I dont know, theres something about autocross,
man. It speaks to me. I love it! But I think


76
0:4:27,24 --> 0:4:30,199
that the
ZR1 has ruined me because I am not sure if


77
0:4:30,199 --> 0:4:33,31
I will ever be satisfied competing in an autocross
in


78
0:4:33,31 --> 0:4:34,3
anything less.


79
0:4:34,3 --> 0:4:36,25
Heres Jessis best time so far.


80
0:4:36,25 --> 0:4:39,349
There was some understeer.


81
0:4:39,349 --> 0:4:49,56
I 
was actually able to improve more than one
second from my first trail to my fifth, which


82
0:4:49,56 --> 0:4:52,33
is a really big
deal. Hundredths of a second matter greatly


83
0:4:52,33 --> 0:4:53,46
in autocross.


84
0:4:53,46 --> 0:4:58,6
For the second part of the day, we moved on
to the oval and this was where I got to put


85
0:4:58,6 --> 0:5:1,729
together all of
the pieces Id learned throughout the day.


86
0:5:1,729 --> 0:5:7,3
Some apexes are long, some are short, some
are early in the corner, some are late in


87
0:5:7,3 --> 0:5:12,49
the corner. So its
the closest point to the inside of the corner


88
0:5:12,49 --> 0:5:18,81
to which your car comes in contact.


89
0:5:18,81 --> 0:5:25,169
Hard on the gas.


90
0:5:25,169 --> 0:5:26,229
Brake point.


91
0:5:26,229 --> 0:5:38,629
Ease off of the brake, turn into your apex,
look to the throttle.


92
0:5:38,629 --> 0:5:38,639
Come back out.


93
0:5:38,639 --> 0:5:38,669
Brake. Okay, so far so good?


94
0:5:38,669 --> 0:5:38,68
Yeah.


95
0:5:38,68 --> 0:5:38,77
What if we dont drive out here and we dive
down in here before our apex cone? Look at


96
0:5:38,77 --> 0:5:38,77
this.


97
0:5:38,77 --> 0:5:38,78
Woah!


98
0:5:38,78 --> 0:5:42,419
With each exercise, I begin with Darren in
the drivers seat, me in the passengers seat,


99
0:5:42,419 --> 0:5:45,9
and hed give me
pointed instruction as we would go around


100
0:5:45,9 --> 0:5:47,849
the course. Then, he would get out and it
would be just


101
0:5:47,849 --> 0:6:4,939
me and the ZR1. And I savored every single
minute of alone-time we got.


102
0:6:4,939 --> 0:6:9,59
I just became much more familiar with spotting
the apex, you know, in a decreasing radius


103
0:6:9,59 --> 0:6:11,939
turn, in an
increasing radius turn, in a constant radius


104
0:6:11,939 --> 0:6:14,229
turn. You know, the more practice you have,
you begin to


105
0:6:14,229 --> 0:6:21,949
sort of get a sense for where the apex is
located.


106
0:6:21,949 --> 0:6:24,75
So its the end of day one, but lucky for me,
we are coming back tomorrow. We are going


107
0:6:24,75 --> 0:6:27,219
to spend the
whole day on the track and I cant wait to


108
0:6:27,219 --> 0:6:29,96
see how much more Im able to learn and gain
and grow.


109
0:6:29,96 --> 0:6:34,84
Alright, it is day two. Last night at Wild
Horse Pass Hotel and Casino, I resisted all


110
0:6:34,84 --> 0:6:37,889
urges to gamble and
instead got a good nights rest. And I am ready


111
0:6:37,889 --> 0:6:38,909
to go.


112
0:6:38,909 --> 0:6:44,69
Although I couldnt wait to get back in the
ZR1, when we arrived, I ran into Bob Bondurant


113
0:6:44,69 --> 0:6:46,449
and I could
not let him leave without treating me to some


114
0:6:46,449 --> 0:6:47,34
hot laps.


115
0:6:47,34 --> 0:6:54,689
Are we ready to go?


116
0:6:54,689 --> 0:7:3,729
Ready to go!


117
0:7:3,729 --> 0:7:6,749
[Laughter]


118
0:7:6,749 --> 0:7:9,77
Woohoo!


119
0:7:9,77 --> 0:7:13,96
He is just balls out, man. You would never
know hes about to be eighty years old. And


120
0:7:13,96 --> 0:7:17,129
hes such a
good driver still. Hes remarkable. I learned


121
0:7:17,129 --> 0:7:20,93
a lot as his passenger.


122
0:7:20,93 --> 0:7:29,65
You recover it so quickly. When you get oversteer
or understeer, in a second you correct it.


123
0:7:29,65 --> 0:7:32,949
And he is such a kid in a candy store in that
ZR1.


124
0:7:32,949 --> 0:7:35,43
Wanna go for a couple more laps?


125
0:7:35,43 --> 0:7:35,789
Sure!


126
0:7:35,789 --> 0:7:40,99
He kept going and going and going. Darren
had to come out on the track and throw the


127
0:7:40,99 --> 0:7:44,669
checkered flag
and say stop already!


128
0:7:44,669 --> 0:7:47,219
That was amazing! Absolutely amazing!


129
0:7:47,219 --> 0:7:49,24
Was that fun?


130
0:7:49,24 --> 0:7:53,31
Yeah, I wanna be you, man. I just wanna be
you.


131
0:7:53,31 --> 0:7:57,229
Today functioned as the culmination of everything
we learned. We put everything together and


132
0:7:57,229 --> 0:7:59,199
spent
the entire day on the track.


133
0:7:59,199 --> 0:8:9,759
Remember where your apex is. Okay, that looks
good. That looks good.


134
0:8:9,759 --> 0:8:14,139
When the day began, you know theres always
this time when you have to reacclimate yourself


135
0:8:14,139 --> 0:8:16,33
and
reorient yourself with the car and its particulars.


136
0:8:16,33 --> 0:8:21,259
Remember, just like we were talking about
even with the skid cars. Look at your apex,


137
0:8:21,259 --> 0:8:23,68
look where you
want to go. You need to drive to that point.


138
0:8:23,68 --> 0:8:25,11
Okay, look for your cones. Stay left, stay
left. Now turn


139
0:8:25,11 --> 0:8:29,719
into your apex right there. Good. Much better.
See now how we are pointed down the road already?


140
0:8:29,719 --> 0:8:40,35
Again, early in is gonna be early out.


141
0:8:40,35 --> 0:8:45,15
A whole lot of the progress I was able to
demonstrate throughout these two days was


142
0:8:45,15 --> 0:8:48,52
a testament to
how fantastic a teacher Darren is.


143
0:8:48,52 --> 0:8:51,47
Okay, this is way too tight through here and
youre way too early. Look at how youre going


144
0:8:51,47 --> 0:8:56,16
off in the
dirt. You see that?


145
0:8:56,16 --> 0:8:57,23
Yes.


146
0:8:57,23 --> 0:9:2,37
Nice downshift! Wow! That sounds good.


147
0:9:2,37 --> 0:9:6,95
He just gives you the most pointed feedback.
He constantly is correcting, tells you what


148
0:9:6,95 --> 0:9:9,68
you did well,
tells you where you were lacking, and then


149
0:9:9,68 --> 0:9:13,7
puts you back out there right away again to
implement that


150
0:9:13,7 --> 0:9:20,73
feedback.


151
0:9:20,73 --> 0:9:32,31
In addition to trying to execute all of these
skills simultaneously, today we also had a


152
0:9:32,31 --> 0:9:35,0
lot of other
drivers on the track, which introduces a completely


153
0:9:35,0 --> 0:9:37,9
new element and a whole lot of pressure on
the


154
0:9:37,9 --> 0:9:38,1
driver.


155
0:9:38,1 --> 0:9:43,88
Im really happy to say though that I was absolutely
able to hang! I was able to keep up with the


156
0:9:43,88 --> 0:9:47,12
fastest
car in the other group and, man, that was


157
0:9:47,12 --> 0:9:56,23
such a satisfying feeling.


158
0:9:56,23 --> 0:10:0,52
So throughout the ZR1 course, youre being
evaluated constantly and youre given a grade


159
0:10:0,52 --> 0:10:3,52
at the end,
upon completion of the course. Its on a scale


160
0:10:3,52 --> 0:10:6,18
of 1 to 5 and 5 is perfect, you made absolutely
no


161
0:10:6,18 --> 0:10:11,31
mistakes, so nobody gets a 5. But I am proud
to say I got a 4 and I was told that is something


162
0:10:11,31 --> 0:10:18,8
to be
proud of.


163
0:10:18,8 --> 0:10:23,91
So my whole objective here was to tame the
ZR1 and what I came away from this knowing


164
0:10:23,91 --> 0:10:27,29
is that the
ZR1 is not meant to be tamed. It should be


165
0:10:27,29 --> 0:12:27,29
wild, free, and unbroken, and you just need
to respect it.
