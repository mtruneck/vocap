0:0:32,431 --> 0:0:36,902
This week on Waterways,


2
0:0:36,902 --> 0:1:0,226
Inasive Exotics in
South Florida.


3
0:1:0,226 --> 0:1:3,863
Dumeril's boa,
Argentine boa,


4
0:1:3,863 --> 0:1:7,7
Cockatoos! These animals are
just a few of the pets


5
0:1:7,7 --> 0:1:9,969
handed over to the Florida
Fish and Wildlife


6
0:1:9,969 --> 0:1:13,139
Conservation Commission
at Pet Amnesty Day.


7
0:1:13,139 --> 0:1:16,142
The list is long; and the
potential danger to the south


8
0:1:16,142 --> 0:1:22,481
Florida ecosystem from some
of these invaders is grave.


9
0:1:22,481 --> 0:1:25,751
One particular invasive exotic
animal has captured many


10
0:1:25,751 --> 0:1:33,325
media headlines: the
Burmese python.


11
0:1:33,325 --> 0:1:35,628
A native to Asia,
the Burmese python


12
0:1:35,628 --> 0:1:37,363
is one of the six
largest snakes in


13
0:1:37,363 --> 0:1:40,399
the world, but it's just one
of an estimated three to


14
0:1:40,399 --> 0:1:43,2
four hundred different
invasive plant and animal


15
0:1:43,2 --> 0:1:46,572
species in south Florida and
that's just south


16
0:1:46,572 --> 0:1:49,508
of Lake Okeechobee. Some
of these organisms


17
0:1:49,508 --> 0:1:52,878
are known to be invasive; while
others have proven to be


18
0:1:52,878 --> 0:1:55,981
invasive elsewhere, but have not
yet reached critical numbers


19
0:1:55,981 --> 0:2:1,53
here.But how did these
snakes get here from Asia?


20
0:2:1,53 --> 0:2:4,56
One theory postulates that
pythons were introduced in


21
0:2:4,56 --> 0:2:7,359
1992 when Hurricane Andrew
tore through Homestead,


22
0:2:7,359 --> 0:2:10,462
Florida, a town near the
southeastern boundary of


23
0:2:10,462 --> 0:2:13,832
Everglades National Park.
The storm flattened a flimsy


24
0:2:13,832 --> 0:2:16,569
storage facility for
imported snakes and other


25
0:2:16,569 --> 0:2:19,471
reptiles resulting in a
release of snakes into the


26
0:2:19,471 --> 0:2:23,108
surrounding ecosystem.
But a more likely theory


27
0:2:23,108 --> 0:2:26,145
is that Burmese pythons in the
Everglades are a cumulative


28
0:2:26,145 --> 0:2:28,647
effect of multiple pet
owners releasing their


29
0:2:28,647 --> 0:2:33,219
snakes into the wild. It
became obvious really early


30
0:2:33,219 --> 0:2:34,853
on that the reason we were
having problems with


31
0:2:34,853 --> 0:2:37,156
constrictors out here in
Everglades National Park and


32
0:2:37,156 --> 0:2:40,326
elsewhere in south Florida
was because people were,


33
0:2:40,326 --> 0:2:43,229
perhaps, making poor,
uninformed decisions about


34
0:2:43,229 --> 0:2:46,599
purchasing these snakes
while they were small and


35
0:2:46,599 --> 0:2:51,3
then in a year when that
snake got out to seven or


36
0:2:51,3 --> 0:2:53,339
eight feet or two years when
it hits double digits they


37
0:2:53,339 --> 0:2:55,241
had no alternatives. To be
honest with you that


38
0:2:55,241 --> 0:2:57,142
question of how these
animals arrived here in the


39
0:2:57,142 --> 0:2:59,245
first place is somewhat
moot. We know that they were


40
0:2:59,245 --> 0:3:0,946
here for one purpose
and one purpose only:


41
0:3:0,946 --> 0:3:3,482
to be eventually sold into
the pet trade at one time or


42
0:3:3,482 --> 0:3:5,384
another. These are animals
that are brought in here


43
0:3:5,384 --> 0:3:7,319
specifically for ownership,
for pet ownership. In south


44
0:3:7,319 --> 0:3:10,589
Florida, Burmese pythons
are considered an invasive


45
0:3:10,589 --> 0:3:14,393
exotic species. Exotic
species are non-native


46
0:3:14,393 --> 0:3:17,329
plants and animals
introduced intentionally or


47
0:3:17,329 --> 0:3:21,267
accidentally to an area
through human activity. It


48
0:3:21,267 --> 0:3:23,235
is crucial to draw a
distinction between an


49
0:3:23,235 --> 0:3:27,72
exotic species and an
invasive exotic species. An


50
0:3:27,72 --> 0:3:30,676
organism can be exotic and
not be invasive. An exotic


51
0:3:30,676 --> 0:3:34,28
organism is not necessarily
harmful to an ecosystem; an


52
0:3:34,28 --> 0:3:39,418
invasive exotic can be
disastrous. Fortunately for


53
0:3:39,418 --> 0:3:42,488
us, the vast majority of
species that are introduced


54
0:3:42,488 --> 0:3:45,19
into an area, exotic
species, don't turn out to


55
0:3:45,19 --> 0:3:48,494
be invasive. Invasive
species are those that go


56
0:3:48,494 --> 0:3:51,43
out of control; that move
beyond cultivation and get


57
0:3:51,43 --> 0:3:53,999
into areas where we don't
intend them to be and begin


58
0:3:53,999 --> 0:3:59,71
reproducing on the
landscape. It's that small


59
0:3:59,71 --> 0:4:0,172
percentage of those
non-native invasive species


60
0:4:0,172 --> 0:4:2,41
that we target in our
management efforts here in


61
0:4:2,41 --> 0:4:3,209
Everglades National
Park. Invasive exotic


62
0:4:3,209 --> 0:4:4,777
species are able to dominate
an ecosystem because they


63
0:4:4,777 --> 0:4:6,578
often have no or few
predators. In their new


64
0:4:6,578 --> 0:4:8,347
environment, there are no
mechanisms to keep the


65
0:4:8,347 --> 0:4:11,884
population in check.
Invasive exotics have not


66
0:4:11,884 --> 0:4:14,53
evolved to live in the
delicate balance of their


67
0:4:14,53 --> 0:4:17,723
new surroundings. Thus, some
invasive species can


68
0:4:17,723 --> 0:4:22,361
decimate the flora and fauna
of an entire ecosystem. The


69
0:4:22,361 --> 0:4:26,165
first line of attack to keep
out invaders? Prevention.


70
0:4:26,165 --> 0:4:28,934
Biologists at Everglades
National Park knew that


71
0:4:28,934 --> 0:4:31,937
eradicating ALL the pythons
within the park boundary


72
0:4:31,937 --> 0:4:34,573
would not solve the problem;
they still needed to


73
0:4:34,573 --> 0:4:38,577
eliminate the source. So in
2006, the Don't Let It Loose


74
0:4:38,577 --> 0:4:42,47
campaign was developed.
Through publications, school


75
0:4:42,47 --> 0:4:45,784
posters, PSAs, billboards
and presentations,


76
0:4:45,784 --> 0:4:48,754
Everglades National Park
made a concerted effort to


77
0:4:48,754 --> 0:4:52,458
reach out to the community
and remind them of the


78
0:4:52,458 --> 0:4:55,794
danger posed by invasive
plants and animals. As part


79
0:4:55,794 --> 0:4:59,565
of the Don't Let It Loose
campaign, resource managers


80
0:4:59,565 --> 0:5:2,0
decided to give people a way
to get rid of their exotic


81
0:5:2,0 --> 0:5:10,8
pets in ways that did not
hurt the environment.


82
0:5:10,8 --> 0:5:13,679
Starting in 2008, the Park
partnered with The Florida


83
0:5:13,679 --> 0:5:15,848
Fish and Wildlife
Conservation Commission and


84
0:5:15,848 --> 0:5:18,25
actually presented the first
non-native pet amnesty day


85
0:5:18,25 --> 0:5:21,19
here in south Florida at
Miami Metro Zoo. And it was


86
0:5:21,19 --> 0:5:23,889
a phenomenally successful
event where we offered folks


87
0:5:23,889 --> 0:5:26,725
the opportunity to come out
with their animals and no


88
0:5:26,725 --> 0:5:31,196
questions asked surrender
their non-domestic pets with


89
0:5:31,196 --> 0:5:36,235
us. A wide range of animals
appear at Amnesty Day


90
0:5:36,235 --> 0:5:41,573
events; turtles, birds and
of course snakes. Resource


91
0:5:41,573 --> 0:5:44,476
managers in Everglades
National Park also knew that


92
0:5:44,476 --> 0:5:47,45
they could not control
python populations or other


93
0:5:47,45 --> 0:5:49,681
invasive exotics if they
could not reach beyond their


94
0:5:49,681 --> 0:5:53,318
borders. So in 2006, the
Everglades Cooperative


95
0:5:53,318 --> 0:5:56,789
Invasive Species Management
Area, or Everglades CISMA,


96
0:5:56,789 --> 0:6:0,492
was created. This
interagency working group


97
0:6:0,492 --> 0:6:2,694
operates across
administrative boundaries to


98
0:6:2,694 --> 0:6:4,596
better manage invasive
species in south


99
0:6:4,596 --> 0:6:8,167
Florida. We've been dealing
with some of these organisms


100
0:6:8,167 --> 0:6:11,69
for literally a century or
more that they've been here


101
0:6:11,69 --> 0:6:13,806
in south Florida and have
been actively managing them


102
0:6:13,806 --> 0:6:16,508
for decades. And they're
species that you're familiar


103
0:6:16,508 --> 0:6:19,611
with; things like melaleuca,
Brazilian pepper, Australian


104
0:6:19,611 --> 0:6:22,748
pine. And the reason we
focus so much attention on


105
0:6:22,748 --> 0:6:25,25
these plant species is that
they are capable of


106
0:6:25,25 --> 0:6:30,289
consuming entire
acreages. While invasive


107
0:6:30,289 --> 0:6:33,592
exotic animals, like the
python, get most of the


108
0:6:33,592 --> 0:6:36,562
media attention, invasive
exotic plants could pose an


109
0:6:36,562 --> 0:6:40,399
even greater threat. Large
areas of the Everglades that


110
0:6:40,399 --> 0:6:43,502
were once dominated by
melaleuca, a native of


111
0:6:43,502 --> 0:6:46,605
Australia, are now at
maintenance levels. Despite


112
0:6:46,605 --> 0:6:49,475
these successes, there are
many areas of south Florida


113
0:6:49,475 --> 0:6:52,478
severely impacted by
invasive exotic plants.


114
0:6:52,478 --> 0:6:57,49
Brazilian pepper,imported in
the 1800s, now covers more


115
0:6:57,49 --> 0:7:1,353
than 700,000 acres in
Florida and Old World


116
0:7:1,353 --> 0:7:4,723
Climbing Fern which can
smother entire forests. It's


117
0:7:4,723 --> 0:7:9,294
unlikely these species will
ever fully be


118
0:7:9,294 --> 0:7:12,898
eradicated. We have five
success stories where our


119
0:7:12,898 --> 0:7:15,701
management actions have
deliberately resulted in the


120
0:7:15,701 --> 0:7:17,603
eradication of a species
from the south Florida


121
0:7:17,603 --> 0:7:20,138
landscape. And now I will
tell you, again this depends


122
0:7:20,138 --> 0:7:22,107
on your definition of
eradication, it's the


123
0:7:22,107 --> 0:7:27,379
black-tailed jack rabbit;
the red-bellied piranha; the


124
0:7:27,379 --> 0:7:31,316
giant Gambian pouch rat; the
giant African snail; really


125
0:7:31,316 --> 0:7:33,51
I don't think we should
importing anything with the


126
0:7:33,51 --> 0:7:36,355
word ëgiant' in its name;
but that's just me. And,


127
0:7:36,355 --> 0:7:39,358
most recently a bird called
the sacred ibis. Upon


128
0:7:39,358 --> 0:7:41,894
closer look at those five
successful eradication


129
0:7:41,894 --> 0:7:45,464
efforts, there is one common
thread: resource managers


130
0:7:45,464 --> 0:7:53,205
learned about those
invasions early on;


131
0:7:53,205 --> 0:8:9,187
and they took action
immediately.


132
0:8:9,187 --> 0:8:13,458
This is Tony Pernas. Tony works
for Everglades National Park


133
0:8:13,458 --> 0:8:16,762
and one of his jobs is to track
an invasive exotic lizard


134
0:8:16,762 --> 0:8:24,169
called the Tegu.


135
0:8:24,169 --> 0:8:26,104
Well we basically, what
we want to find out


136
0:8:26,104 --> 0:8:30,375
about the tegus is
their movements in the


137
0:8:30,375 --> 0:8:32,244
Florida City area and
whether they're moving into


138
0:8:32,244 --> 0:8:34,546
natural areas and what
habitats they're using. We


139
0:8:34,546 --> 0:8:36,415
just want to find out as
much information as we can


140
0:8:36,415 --> 0:8:39,451
about the tegus so we can
hopefully effectively manage


141
0:8:39,451 --> 0:8:43,555
their population. Tony and
his team have caught tegus


142
0:8:43,555 --> 0:8:45,724
within the boundaries of
Everglades National Park.


143
0:8:45,724 --> 0:8:48,727
Today, they are collecting
images from their field


144
0:8:48,727 --> 0:8:53,198
cameras in areas surrounding
the Park. So as part of an


145
0:8:53,198 --> 0:8:56,68
effort to assess the
population of Argentine


146
0:8:56,68 --> 0:8:59,638
black and white tegus, we
have a system or a network


147
0:8:59,638 --> 0:9:3,508
of camera monitoring traps
and this is one of them that


148
0:9:3,508 --> 0:9:7,779
we check periodically to see
if any tegus are present in


149
0:9:7,779 --> 0:9:12,751
the area. These cameras are
triggered by motion and


150
0:9:12,751 --> 0:9:16,154
infrared sensors. Using
chicken eggs as bait, the


151
0:9:16,154 --> 0:9:18,757
researchers have had a lot
of success capturing images


152
0:9:18,757 --> 0:9:23,195
of tegus. Really quickly,
we're just downloading the


153
0:9:23,195 --> 0:9:25,964
data card and see if we had
any activity on this one


154
0:9:25,964 --> 0:9:29,67
particular camera. This is a
good thing about these


155
0:9:29,67 --> 0:9:31,136
cameras, because you don't
actually have to be there.


156
0:9:31,136 --> 0:9:33,605
You can set up a network of
these cameras with bait so


157
0:9:33,605 --> 0:9:35,841
you get a record of anything
that's visiting this site,


158
0:9:35,841 --> 0:9:39,778
twenty-four hours a day. So
why are all of these exotic


159
0:9:39,778 --> 0:9:42,47
species showing up in south
Florida in the first


160
0:9:42,47 --> 0:9:45,283
place? We are a biological
hot spot for these


161
0:9:45,283 --> 0:9:48,153
invasions. We're up there
with southern California and


162
0:9:48,153 --> 0:9:51,189
Hawaii for being just a hub
of having these things


163
0:9:51,189 --> 0:9:52,724
introduced; largely because
of the large amount of


164
0:9:52,724 --> 0:9:55,394
commerce in the area as well
as the favorable climate


165
0:9:55,394 --> 0:9:58,697
that hosts these organisms.
So we've had a lot of things


166
0:9:58,697 --> 0:10:0,799
introduced, but we've been
lucky so far that we haven't


167
0:10:0,799 --> 0:10:4,569
really had that one
cataclysmic species. That


168
0:10:4,569 --> 0:10:12,511
was until very
recently. MUSIC Beautiful,


169
0:10:12,511 --> 0:10:15,213
bold, maroon and white
striped patterns across the


170
0:10:15,213 --> 0:10:22,788
body; ornate spires jutting
in all directions, regal and


171
0:10:22,788 --> 0:10:26,925
striking with long pectoral
fins and prominent dorsal


172
0:10:26,925 --> 0:10:32,898
spines: the lionfish. So
beautiful that people buy


173
0:10:32,898 --> 0:10:38,3
them for their home
aquariums; However, these


174
0:10:38,3 --> 0:10:40,739
beautiful fish now threaten
the coral reefs of


175
0:10:40,739 --> 0:10:46,545
the Florida Keys.


176
0:10:46,545 --> 0:10:49,414
Lionfish are an
Indo-Pacific reef fish


177
0:10:49,414 --> 0:10:52,951
and the Florida Keys are far
away from their native range.


178
0:10:52,951 --> 0:10:55,32
Today, however, they are
established from North


179
0:10:55,32 --> 0:11:1,46
Carolina throughout the
Caribbean, and are now


180
0:11:1,46 --> 0:11:5,97
invading the Gulf of
Mexico. And if you look at


181
0:11:5,97 --> 0:11:7,866
the time in which they have
achieved that geographic


182
0:11:7,866 --> 0:11:11,369
range, it is astounding. We
first saw lionfish off the


183
0:11:11,369 --> 0:11:16,208
coast of North Carolina in
2000. That marked the


184
0:11:16,208 --> 0:11:19,1
beginning of the
establishment of


185
0:11:19,1 --> 0:11:24,149
lionfish. And the Bahamas
are probably the most


186
0:11:24,149 --> 0:11:26,184
heavily invaded area in the
Caribbean right now. And the


187
0:11:26,184 --> 0:11:28,22
density of lionfish in the
Bahamas now are among the


188
0:11:28,22 --> 0:11:30,288
highest we know of anywhere
in the world. We're talking


189
0:11:30,288 --> 0:11:32,9
in excess of four hundred
lionfish per hectare. That's


190
0:11:32,9 --> 0:11:35,6
a lot of lionfish. They are
becoming one of the biggest


191
0:11:35,6 --> 0:11:37,95
predatory fish on the reef.


192
0:11:37,95 --> 0:11:43,668
A big question everyone has


193
0:11:43,668 --> 0:11:46,605
is how did this invasion
start? And of course there


194
0:11:46,605 --> 0:11:49,7
are a number of different
potential pathways; ballast


195
0:11:49,7 --> 0:11:53,645
water from ships; natural
migration is highly unlikely


196
0:11:53,645 --> 0:11:56,81
seeing that it is a long way
to the Indo-Pacific and


197
0:11:56,81 --> 0:11:59,251
there have been no
populations established


198
0:11:59,251 --> 0:12:2,387
along the way. But aquarium
releases are another


199
0:12:2,387 --> 0:12:5,423
pathway. And that's the most
likely pathway that these


200
0:12:5,423 --> 0:12:8,59
fish were introduced
from. Releases usually


201
0:12:8,59 --> 0:12:11,429
happen because it gets too
big for the aquarium; it


202
0:12:11,429 --> 0:12:14,65
costs too much to keep
feeding it; the person


203
0:12:14,65 --> 0:12:16,835
holding the fish feels sorry
for the fish because it's a


204
0:12:16,835 --> 0:12:19,404
pet and they want to release
it- sort of the ëNemo'


205
0:12:19,404 --> 0:12:23,642
syndrome. Or they're moving
and they don't want to kill


206
0:12:23,642 --> 0:12:28,213
the fish or give it back to
the pet store. Once


207
0:12:28,213 --> 0:12:31,116
introduced to the Atlantic,
lionfish spread rapidly.


208
0:12:31,116 --> 0:12:35,287
They have a superior ability
to colonize, and their life


209
0:12:35,287 --> 0:12:38,19
history creates a perfect
storm of propagation,


210
0:12:38,19 --> 0:12:41,92
starting with the
larvae. The long larval


211
0:12:41,92 --> 0:12:44,863
duration period of lionfish
allows them to basically be


212
0:12:44,863 --> 0:12:47,766
distributed anywhere in
their invaded range. So


213
0:12:47,766 --> 0:12:51,102
lionfish spawned in the
Caribbean for example can


214
0:12:51,102 --> 0:12:55,24
end up off of North Carolina
waters because of that


215
0:12:55,24 --> 0:12:59,411
larval duration. And so that
is one of the many


216
0:12:59,411 --> 0:13:2,314
characteristics of lionfish
that has facilitated or


217
0:13:2,314 --> 0:13:5,283
allowed this invasion
to take hold.


218
0:13:5,283 --> 0:13:7,853
Another reason lionfish have
been able to colonize so


219
0:13:7,853 --> 0:13:11,289
effectively, is due to the lack
of competition for reef space


220
0:13:11,289 --> 0:13:14,426
and food. For years,
top-level predators that


221
0:13:14,426 --> 0:13:16,494
inhabit the Florida Keys
reefs have been


222
0:13:16,494 --> 0:13:20,565
over-fished - this reduction
of native species has left a


223
0:13:20,565 --> 0:13:24,703
vacant niche. And in the
case of invasive species, we


224
0:13:24,703 --> 0:13:27,906
see classically that
invaders can come in and


225
0:13:27,906 --> 0:13:30,609
occupy vacant niches in new
environments and can cause


226
0:13:30,609 --> 0:13:33,712
real problems to those
environments. Such is the


227
0:13:33,712 --> 0:13:36,214
case with lionfish and the
real concern is that if


228
0:13:36,214 --> 0:13:38,683
lionfish come in and take
over that niche then how


229
0:13:38,683 --> 0:13:41,419
will that impact our stock
rebuilding efforts for the


230
0:13:41,419 --> 0:13:44,322
snapper grouper complex? And
how will that impact the


231
0:13:44,322 --> 0:13:46,825
structure of the
reef communutities?


232
0:13:46,825 --> 0:13:49,961
Lionfish competing for a food
source with economically


233
0:13:49,961 --> 0:13:53,999
important species is bad;
lionfish eating economically


234
0:13:53,999 --> 0:14:0,639
important species is worse.
Biologists have found Nassau


235
0:14:0,639 --> 0:14:4,175
Grouper, yellowtail snapper,
and vermillion snapper in


236
0:14:4,175 --> 0:14:8,613
the stomachs of lionfish in
the Atlantic. We're


237
0:14:8,613 --> 0:14:13,151
concerned that as lionfish
continue to prey upon these


238
0:14:13,151 --> 0:14:15,82
species and prey down the
numbers, beircause lionfish


239
0:14:15,82 --> 0:14:19,824
are one of the most dominant
reef fishes now in some


240
0:14:19,824 --> 0:14:23,61
coral reef environments like
in the Bahamas, that they


241
0:14:23,61 --> 0:14:26,665
will then go to some of the
juveniles of economically


242
0:14:26,665 --> 0:14:29,2
important species. And
that's a real concern


243
0:14:29,2 --> 0:14:31,369
because increase predation
pressure on those


244
0:14:31,369 --> 0:14:33,905
economically important
species could in fact hamper


245
0:14:33,905 --> 0:14:36,241
stock rebuilding
efforts. Lionfish also


246
0:14:36,241 --> 0:14:39,177
consume ecologically
important species, such as


247
0:14:39,177 --> 0:14:42,881
parrotfish and wrasses; fish
that graze the reef and eat


248
0:14:42,881 --> 0:14:46,785
algae, which competes with
coral. Lad Akins from Reef


249
0:14:46,785 --> 0:14:49,688
Environmental Education
Foundation sees signs in the


250
0:14:49,688 --> 0:14:51,723
Bahamas that alarm
him. They're becoming one


251
0:14:51,723 --> 0:14:55,694
of the most abundant
predatory fish on the reef.


252
0:14:55,694 --> 0:14:59,97
And the impacts that those
fish are having are being


253
0:14:59,97 --> 0:15:1,99
seen as simply
unsustainable. They're


254
0:15:1,99 --> 0:15:5,37
consuming native reef fish
at a rate far faster than


255
0:15:5,37 --> 0:15:7,939
the native fish can
recover. The first


256
0:15:7,939 --> 0:15:10,508
confirmed lionfish sighting
in the Florida Keys National


257
0:15:10,508 --> 0:15:14,646
Marine Sanctuary was in
January 2009, and resource


258
0:15:14,646 --> 0:15:17,816
managers in the Keys were
ready for it. NOAA had been


259
0:15:17,816 --> 0:15:20,385
working on a lionfish
invasion response program


260
0:15:20,385 --> 0:15:22,754
for nearly a decade. The
program's key


261
0:15:22,754 --> 0:15:26,358
element engaging the public.
Months before the first


262
0:15:26,358 --> 0:15:28,76
confirmed sighting,
sanctuary staff and their


263
0:15:28,76 --> 0:15:30,929
partners at Reef
Environmental Education


264
0:15:30,929 --> 0:15:34,366
Foundation and Mote Marine
Lab educated the public on


265
0:15:34,366 --> 0:15:37,369
how to identify the fish and
who to call to report a


266
0:15:37,369 --> 0:15:40,972
sighting. When the first
lionfish sighting report


267
0:15:40,972 --> 0:15:44,642
came in January 2009, a
response team from Reef


268
0:15:44,642 --> 0:15:47,746
Environmental Education
Foundation, also known as


269
0:15:47,746 --> 0:15:50,782
REEF, was mobilized and
caught the culprit the very


270
0:15:50,782 --> 0:15:54,152
next morning. Sanctuary
managers even issued the


271
0:15:54,152 --> 0:15:58,69
fish a mock citation for
trespassing. As reef


272
0:15:58,69 --> 0:16:1,76
managers anticipated,
lionfish populations spread


273
0:16:1,76 --> 0:16:5,33
quickly throughout the
Florida Keys reef tract. Six


274
0:16:5,33 --> 0:16:7,565
months after the first
sanctuary sighting, the


275
0:16:7,565 --> 0:16:10,568
first lionfish was caught
just south of Miami, in


276
0:16:10,568 --> 0:16:13,772
Biscayne National Park, the
largest marine park in the


277
0:16:13,772 --> 0:16:18,71
National Park System. So
far, park staff have caught


278
0:16:18,71 --> 0:16:21,88
nearly 900. Invasive
exotics are a problem in


279
0:16:21,88 --> 0:16:24,215
Biscayne National Park. The
lionfish represents the


280
0:16:24,215 --> 0:16:26,584
first case of a marine
invasive that we've been


281
0:16:26,584 --> 0:16:30,88
concerned about. Before our
main issues had been with


282
0:16:30,88 --> 0:16:35,193
plants, so this is a whole
new realm for us. As the


283
0:16:35,193 --> 0:16:41,433
invasion progressed, so too
did the response. In 2009,


284
0:16:41,433 --> 0:16:44,969
sanctuary managers and REEF
began training dive-shop


285
0:16:44,969 --> 0:16:48,44
personnel, marine-life
collectors and researchers


286
0:16:48,44 --> 0:16:53,111
on how to safely collect
lionfish. Since 2009, more


287
0:16:53,111 --> 0:16:56,314
than 500 divers have been
trained to safely handle and


288
0:16:56,314 --> 0:17:4,322
collect lionfish in
the Florida Keys.


289
0:17:4,322 --> 0:17:7,459
Lionfish are very quick over
short distances, which make


290
0:17:7,459 --> 0:17:11,83
them a challenge to catch. Many
people say, well what is the


291
0:17:11,83 --> 0:17:14,399
best way to collect a
lionfish? And certainly


292
0:17:14,399 --> 0:17:17,702
spearing a lionfish is an
option where spearing is


293
0:17:17,702 --> 0:17:23,74
allowed. But because the
fish are so quick and have


294
0:17:23,74 --> 0:17:26,911
such fast reflexes, it's
easy to miss with a spear;


295
0:17:26,911 --> 0:17:31,749
even on a very close
approach. The lionfish just


296
0:17:31,749 --> 0:17:35,19
moves at the very last
second and you miss. And


297
0:17:35,19 --> 0:17:38,256
once the spear goes flying
by, the lionfish gets the


298
0:17:38,256 --> 0:17:42,93
idea- when I see a person,
they are trying to get me


299
0:17:42,93 --> 0:17:44,462
and I'm going to leave. And
it makes subsequent


300
0:17:44,462 --> 0:17:45,964
collection efforts for that
fish very


301
0:17:45,964 --> 0:17:53,872
difficult. Lionfish hunters
have had much more success


302
0:17:53,872 --> 0:17:57,976
using nets. Using two nets,
the diver can gingerly


303
0:17:57,976 --> 0:18:5,884
maneuver the nets
around the lionfish.


304
0:18:5,884 --> 0:18:8,586
That doesn't mean don't use a
spear, in fact on some of the


305
0:18:8,586 --> 0:18:11,689
bigger fish that may be a better
option. But especially for


306
0:18:11,689 --> 0:18:15,86
small fish and a higher success
rate, the nets seem to work


307
0:18:15,86 --> 0:18:23,701
very, very well. Those who
hunt lionfish need to


308
0:18:23,701 --> 0:18:26,738
exercise caution. It is
highly recommended that


309
0:18:26,738 --> 0:18:29,908
anyone who handles lionfish
receive training on how to


310
0:18:29,908 --> 0:18:33,511
do it safely. Although the
spines on a lionfish are not


311
0:18:33,511 --> 0:18:37,348
lethal, reactions to the
stings can vary and usually


312
0:18:37,348 --> 0:18:40,84
include pain and swelling.
If you're stung, the best


313
0:18:40,84 --> 0:18:42,954
treatment is to immerse the
wound in hot, but not


314
0:18:42,954 --> 0:18:45,523
scalding water. A lionfish
is venomous. Just the spines


315
0:18:45,523 --> 0:18:48,393
contain the venom. You don't
eat the spines and therefore


316
0:18:48,393 --> 0:18:51,829
you are not, you are not
going to be exposed to any


317
0:18:51,829 --> 0:18:55,266
of the venom. We eat the
flesh, we eat the filets and


318
0:18:55,266 --> 0:18:58,136
they are not poisonous in
any way. If you haven't


319
0:18:58,136 --> 0:19:0,738
been trained or you don't
feel comfortable capturing a


320
0:19:0,738 --> 0:19:3,7
lionfish, the next best
thing is to mark down the


321
0:19:3,7 --> 0:19:7,78
location where you saw
it. The good news about


322
0:19:7,78 --> 0:19:11,349
that information is that if
we get a report, it's very


323
0:19:11,349 --> 0:19:13,818
likely that fish is going to
be in the same spot when we


324
0:19:13,818 --> 0:19:16,721
go out to respond. So we can
have high confidence in


325
0:19:16,721 --> 0:19:19,123
being able to respond in our
early detection and rapid


326
0:19:19,123 --> 0:19:28,533
response efforts.


327
0:19:28,533 --> 0:19:29,901
We have been looking
at what's going


328
0:19:29,901 --> 0:19:32,837
to keep them in check here.
What keeps them in check in


329
0:19:32,837 --> 0:19:35,373
their native range; what
keeps them in check in their


330
0:19:35,373 --> 0:19:37,475
invaded range. And what
we're finding is that few


331
0:19:37,475 --> 0:19:38,676
things eat lionfish. In
feeding trials conducted fin


332
0:19:38,676 --> 0:19:46,417
a lab, Morris tested whether
or not native groupers would


333
0:19:46,417 --> 0:19:50,388
feed upon lionfish. In
almost every situation, the


334
0:19:50,388 --> 0:19:53,358
native groupers fed upon
alternative prey when given


335
0:19:53,358 --> 0:19:56,928
a choice, avoiding lionfish
even during extreme


336
0:19:56,928 --> 0:20:1,699
starvation. Not to say that
nothing eats lionfish, but


337
0:20:1,699 --> 0:20:3,901
we're finding that few
things eat lionfish. That


338
0:20:3,901 --> 0:20:5,837
again is one of the
characteristics in their


339
0:20:5,837 --> 0:20:7,872
life history that has
probably allowed them to


340
0:20:7,872 --> 0:20:10,942
become so
invasive. However, there is


341
0:20:10,942 --> 0:20:13,478
one predator at the top of
the food chain that could


342
0:20:13,478 --> 0:20:18,583
help manage lionfish
populations, us. Lionfish is


343
0:20:18,583 --> 0:20:22,754
actually a very good eating
fish; and REEF and NOAA's


344
0:20:22,754 --> 0:20:26,624
Eat Lionfish campaign are
working to create demand for


345
0:20:26,624 --> 0:20:30,995
lionfish. Restaurants in the
Florida Keys have already


346
0:20:30,995 --> 0:20:35,633
begun serving lionfish, and
REEF has published The


347
0:20:35,633 --> 0:20:37,669
Lionfish Cookbook: The
Caribbean's New


348
0:20:37,669 --> 0:20:41,105
Delicacy. Encouraging
restaurants to serve them on


349
0:20:41,105 --> 0:20:43,474
the menu is important. And
trying lionfish; it is a


350
0:20:43,474 --> 0:20:46,11
great eating fish. It's kind
of a cross between on


351
0:20:46,11 --> 0:20:49,747
hogfish and a grouper; very
delicate, light flavored


352
0:20:49,747 --> 0:20:53,951
meat. So encouraging that
and eating lionfish when it


353
0:20:53,951 --> 0:20:56,354
is available. It's going to
help create that market


354
0:20:56,354 --> 0:21:1,192
demand. Lionfish are here
to stay, but resource


355
0:21:1,192 --> 0:21:4,162
managers are working hard to
keep their numbers in check


356
0:21:4,162 --> 0:21:8,766
using some novel control
strategies. In 2010, REEF


357
0:21:8,766 --> 0:21:11,369
and the Florida Keys
National Marine Sanctuary


358
0:21:11,369 --> 0:21:16,107
hosted three lionfish
derbies in which 660


359
0:21:16,107 --> 0:21:19,177
lionfish were removed from
sanctuary waters by dive


360
0:21:19,177 --> 0:21:22,246
teams competing for more
than $10,000 in cash and


361
0:21:22,246 --> 0:21:25,983
prizes. More than 1200
lionfish were removed in two


362
0:21:25,983 --> 0:21:32,623
derbies in 2011 and more
round-ups are being planned.


363
0:21:32,623 --> 0:21:35,93
Researchers collected
samples from lionfish caught


364
0:21:35,93 --> 0:21:38,229
at the derbies to learn more
about lionfish genetics,


365
0:21:38,229 --> 0:21:41,499
growth and impacts to native
marine life, and tournament


366
0:21:41,499 --> 0:21:45,69
attendees sampled lionfish
dishes. These events, along


367
0:21:45,69 --> 0:21:51,275
with diver involvement and
lionfish consumption are


368
0:21:51,275 --> 0:21:53,578
important strategies in
keeping lionfish under


369
0:21:53,578 --> 0:21:57,448
control. If the lionfish
populations are going to be


370
0:21:57,448 --> 0:22:0,17
kept in check, the National
Parks and the Marine


371
0:22:0,17 --> 0:22:3,454
Sanctuary need your help. To
report a lionfish sighting


372
0:22:3,454 --> 0:22:10,61
or capture, take note of the
location and submit a report


373
0:22:10,61 --> 0:22:12,797
to www.reef.org. I don't
want to minimize that fact


374
0:22:12,797 --> 0:22:15,166
that people are going to be
the controlling factor of


375
0:22:15,166 --> 0:22:18,636
this. And if anyone wants to
get involved and take part,


376
0:22:18,636 --> 0:22:20,805
they are really going to be
doing a lot to help protect


377
0:22:20,805 --> 0:22:23,841
the oceans. Minimizing and
managing lionfish


378
0:22:23,841 --> 0:22:26,878
populations is also
dependent upon eliminating


379
0:22:26,878 --> 0:22:29,614
the historic source of
lionfish introductions into


380
0:22:29,614 --> 0:22:32,784
the wild: people. The best
thing to do if you have an


381
0:22:32,784 --> 0:22:35,52
unwanted fish is first
contact the store at which


382
0:22:35,52 --> 0:22:37,288
you purchased the fish and
see if they're willing to


383
0:22:37,288 --> 0:22:41,359
take it back; and many are.
If that's not feasible, you


384
0:22:41,359 --> 0:22:44,662
may have other aquarium
owners that may be


385
0:22:44,662 --> 0:22:47,832
interested in your fish. And
finally if you just can't do


386
0:22:47,832 --> 0:22:50,301
anything else, the most
humane way to deal with the


387
0:22:50,301 --> 0:22:53,905
fish is probably just freeze
it. Put it in a container,


388
0:22:53,905 --> 0:22:57,175
put ice in there, the
temperature will cool off


389
0:22:57,175 --> 0:23:0,344
very quickly and the fish
will just kind of shut down


390
0:23:0,344 --> 0:23:7,652
and end up passing away. You
certainly don't want to


391
0:23:7,652 --> 0:23:11,422
release it into the
wild. The Keys is an


392
0:23:11,422 --> 0:23:13,825
especially sensitive
environment. One, because of


393
0:23:13,825 --> 0:23:16,527
the status of coral reef
environments in general; the


394
0:23:16,527 --> 0:23:19,831
stressors that are happening
in coral reef environments,


395
0:23:19,831 --> 0:23:23,601
like coral bleaching and
others, can in fact compound


396
0:23:23,601 --> 0:23:24,702
the stress felt by a
lionfish invasion. And how


397
0:23:24,702 --> 0:23:28,706
these stressors all work
together and impact the fish


398
0:23:28,706 --> 0:23:33,11
community and the coral
community is really unknown.


399
0:23:33,11 --> 0:23:36,214
And we're sort of getting
out on virgin territory in


400
0:23:36,214 --> 0:23:38,649
terms of assessing or
forecasting or predicting


401
0:23:38,649 --> 0:23:46,657
the impact of an
invader like this.


402
0:23:46,657 --> 0:23:49,827
Each year, at least two or three
new ìinvadersî appear in south


403
0:23:49,827 --> 0:23:53,3
Florida that don't belong
here. Will these exotic


404
0:23:53,3 --> 0:23:56,601
species become invasive?
What will their impact be on


405
0:23:56,601 --> 0:24:0,872
the south Florida
ecosystem? When we do have


406
0:24:0,872 --> 0:24:3,474
a new introduction, we count
on those five to six million


407
0:24:3,474 --> 0:24:6,611
people out here to be our
twelve million eyes and


408
0:24:6,611 --> 0:24:9,347
ears; our first line of
defense in letting us know


409
0:24:9,347 --> 0:24:12,55
when new introductions
happen. Recently, the


410
0:24:12,55 --> 0:24:15,19
Everglades Cooperative
Invasive Species Management


411
0:24:15,19 --> 0:24:18,55
Area, launched a new
campaign called I've Got


412
0:24:18,55 --> 0:24:21,425
One. Anybody in south
Florida who sees a plant or


413
0:24:21,425 --> 0:24:24,195
animal that they don't think
is quite right it looks


414
0:24:24,195 --> 0:24:27,265
different, sounds different,
they think it's an invasive


415
0:24:27,265 --> 0:24:30,835
species, they can report it,
either by calling


416
0:24:30,835 --> 0:24:38,743
1-888-I-GOT-ONE or online at
www.Ivegot1.org. Making


417
0:24:38,743 --> 0:24:41,245
that report sets into motion
a team of responders, just


418
0:24:41,245 --> 0:24:44,715
like a call to 911. A group
of individuals goes out,


419
0:24:44,715 --> 0:24:47,618
verifies that report and if
management actions mandate


420
0:24:47,618 --> 0:24:50,388
it, we can act quickly,
interagency, to go and quell


421
0:24:50,388 --> 0:24:53,524
that population before it
expands out of control. And


422
0:24:53,524 --> 0:24:56,694
that's the key  acting
quickly before a population


423
0:24:56,694 --> 0:24:59,897
gets out of control. But the
local, state and federal


424
0:24:59,897 --> 0:25:2,4
land management agencies
can't do it without your


425
0:25:2,4 --> 0:25:6,17
help. Here's what you can
do: first and foremeost  be


426
0:25:6,17 --> 0:25:9,6
a responsible pet owner. If
you have an exotic pet you


427
0:25:9,6 --> 0:25:14,545
can no longer take care of,
go to myfwc.com/nonnatives


428
0:25:14,545 --> 0:25:17,448
for dates and locations of
upcoming non-native pet


429
0:25:17,448 --> 0:25:21,586
amnesty days. Second, learn
to identify what's native


430
0:25:21,586 --> 0:25:24,822
and what's not. If you spot
a plant or animal that


431
0:25:24,822 --> 0:25:27,291
shouldn't be here, like the
elusive Burmese python,


432
0:25:27,291 --> 0:25:30,328
report it at www.IvegotOne.org.


433
0:25:30,328 --> 0:25:37,34
To report a lionfish sighting or
capture, go to www.reef.org.


434
0:25:37,34 --> 0:27:37,34
In the end, the natives
will thank you.
