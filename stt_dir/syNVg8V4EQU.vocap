###19 Over the last few months, I've been approached several times about the
###22 subject of death,
###23 including a tag by the wonderful Largo64, and the glorious Rozeboosje,
###28 enquires about psychological studies,
###30 assertions that I'm 'pro-mortality',
###33 questions about my responses to some thought-terminating cliches,
###36 and about my personal outlook.
###39 I've always been fascinated by how we cope with death --
###42 or more interestingly how we fail to cope with it,
###45 with all the destructive consequences those failures bring.
###48 It's also had some personal residence for me recently.
###52 It feels the right time to share that I started experiencing throat problems a few
###55 months ago that wouldn't go away.
###58 When I reported the symptoms,
###60 the doctors immediately suspected an aggressive type of cancer that one of my
###63 brothers died of, and I was rushed through a series of tests.
###67 I recently received the results of those tests.
###70 My condition is benign.
###73 Given this temporary stay of execution, I thought I'd address all of these
###76 solicitations in two videos,
###79 dedicated to death.
###80 But before I begin,
###82 I'd like to invite you to take a moment to consider your personal reaction to
###86 these videos about death --
###88 your reactions as you watch them
###89 and also before you started watching, when you saw they were available.
###94 What with the thoughts and feelings that came up for you?
###96 Were they positive?
###98 Negative? Mixed?
###99 Blank?
###101 I'd invite you to hold these responses in mind
###104 and, if it feels ok,
###106 perhaps share some of them.
###111 We have a lot to deal with in this experience we call life don't we?
###114 At the most basic level, we're faced with the physical challenges of survival:
###118 finding and competing for food,
###121 water, shelter,
###122 and -- if we so inclined --
###124 sexual partners,
###125 while distancing ourselves from diseases,
###128 parasites,
###129 predators,
###130 natural disasters.
###132 On the social level, we find ourselves within a species containing huge
###135 variation.
###136 We must determine the significance of these differences -- if indeed there is any --
###140 and find our own place within this variety.
###143 On the psychological level
###145 we wrestle with all kinds of unknowns,
###147 unpredictabilities,
###149 ambiguities, dissonances.
###151 We live with swathes of unanswered questions:
###154 questions about the universe we find around us,
###157 and the one we find inside us:
###159 our own mind, with so many of its processes blocked out of our awareness.
###164 Perhaps the most profound paradox we experience comes when we bring the
###167 universe and the mind together -- as the meaningless meets the meaning-hungry.
###172 Within that paradox, the task we seem to find most intimidating of all is
###176 the business of confronting death.
###178 We can infer that level of intimidation by the extreme lengths we employ to deny
###182 death.
###183 Extreme protected lengths,
###185 employing a range of physical and psychological barriers to block
###188 the fear out,
###189 and extreme aggressive lengths, dehumanising, attacking and killing those
###193 who face us with our fears.
###196 We witness and experience all kinds of disproportionate emotional responses in
###200 life.
###201 An example familiar to us all is phobias.
###203 For the phobic individual, there's a sizeable mismatch between the perceived
###207 and actual levels of threat associated with the phobic object or situation.
###212 As a child, I was arachnophobic. I ascribed a quasi-human intelligence to
###217 the spider's stealthy behaviour,
###218 and imagined that its goal was to get into my mouth.
###221 I never questioned why it might want to do that.
###224 But that's the self-preserving nature of fair -- it facilitates irrational
###228 fantasies and pseudo-explanations that maintain the fear,
###232 while simultaneously diminishing our capacity for the kinds of rational
###235 processing that might break its hold.
###237 One of the saving graces of phobias is that they're generally owned by the
###241 individual.
###242 As that arachnophobic child, I didn't go round thinking everyone else was
###246 wrong not to have a spider phobia.
###248 I knew the problem was mine.
###250 But there are other kinds of disproportionate emotional responses
###253 where ownership of one's own fears aren't so easily accepted.
###257 As a child coming up to 14,
###259 about to announce my departure from the religion into which I'd been
###261 indoctrinated,
###263 I actually expected a positive reaction.
###265 Having spent months in private thought, trying to justify my belief in that
###269 religion,
###270 it dawned on me:
###271 every magical being so far had been hoaxes played by the adults.
###275 I kicked myself for spending so much time working through the arguments and I looked forward
###279 to having a laugh with the adults when they found out I'd seen through this
###282 religion hoax too.
###284 My announcement of non-belief was greeted with rage,
###287 contempt and punishment.
###290 When the fatwa was declared on Salman Rushdie in 1989,
###293 I initially dismissed it as a prank.
###295 Appealing to worldwide followers to implement a death sentence
###299 just for writing a novel?
###300 I'd never heard anything so pathetic and ridiculous â€” but Khomeini's decree was
###305 genuine.
###306 Such homicidal theocracies actually existed.
###309 Ten years ago, a muslim friend of mine shared that her nephew had come out to her
###313 as a homosexual.
###314 She told me that if their family found out, he'd be taken to India and
###318 buried alive.
###319 Furthermore, if her family found out that she knew and hadn't told them,
###323 the same would happen to her.
###326 Five years ago, when I first heard of the anti-atheist hate widely promulgated
###329 across the US, I thought it had to be some big national joke.
###333 Some trendy,
###335 ironic, faux-prejudice.
###337 When I realised it was serious,
###339 I joined the discourse.
###341 My focus back then was purely on the prejudicial aspects, rather than debating
###344 the existence of gods.
###346 But in response to simply revealing my atheism
###349 I received death wishes,
###351 death threats,
###352 suggestions that I was already dead
###354 spiritually -- and of course salivating references to my perpetual living death
###359 in hell.
###360 Talk about overkill. But I recognised some of my own stuff here too.
###364 At age 12, when I was an active christian, a religious education teacher
###368 asked me why I believe what I believed. The question seemed innocuous enough at
###372 first.
###374 But as I reflected on it, I realised nothing valid was coming to mind.
###378 An appropriate response would've been to simply admit that.
###381 My actual response?
###382 I wanted that teacher wiped from the face of the planet.
###387 What drives these extreme reactions? What's the big deal?
###391 Were the believers here any less free to believe whatever they wanted?
###394 Divine beliefs are generally claimed to bring inner peace -- but what kind of inner
###398 peace is it that demands that other people get their inner peace the same way ....
###403 or else!
###405 Clearly in each of these cases,
###407 with such hyper-aggressive defences being mobilised,
###410 the aggressor was protecting something tremendously fragile.
###413 Emerging out of the cocoon of religion,
###416 the big deal for me was death --
###418 realising that there was no reason whatsoever to believe I'd be reborn,
###422 reincarnated,
###423 resurrected or reconstituted in any way after my physical demise --
###428 let alone reunited with loved ones in some sugary hereafter.
###432 It quickly occurred to me that this was of course the prime psychological function
###436 of the part of our culture we label 'religion':
###440 to deny death.
###442 To reject the unthinkable thought that when our brains stop,
###445 we stop.
###447 We have a host of other cultural props and mechanisms explicitly designed to
###450 help us deal with the passing of friends and family:
###453 ceremonies where we can share our feelings;
###456 professional services to help us process our bereavement;
###459 dedicated locations we can visit to keep our memories alive.
###463 But for many of us, these things just aren't enough.
###465 The pain of fully letting go
###468 feels unendurable.
###469 Added to which,
###470 if we admit the finality of our loved ones,
###473 we're implicitly faced with our own finality.
###476 In this state of denial, we seek out illusions
###479 that offer a promise of perpetuity.
###485 On the physical front, there's not much scope for illusions of perpetuity --
###489 corpses wreak of finality.
###492 In the initial stages, while they still maintain some semblance of the living state,
###496 we might just about be able to sustain some fantasies consistent with
###500 natural processes --
###501 for example that the person's merely sleeping.
###503 But when the decay really kicks in,
###505 the evidence of finality is just too uncomfortable.
###509 To deny death,
###510 we turn to the non-physical -- to the realm of symbolic thought.
###514 Our capacity for this kind of thinking has led us to entertain a multitude of
###518 figurative forms of immortality.
###520 Some folks see themselves preserved in their children.
###523 Some folks pursue their own individual fame or power as a buffer against extinction.
###527 Some devote themselves to influential figures, or invest themselves
###532 in a group they feel to be emblematic of their own values.
###535 Impersonal cultural institutions like the law offer a sense of order and
###540 protection,
###541 diminishing our awareness of disorder and vulnerability.
###545 Architecture, built to spend many lifetimes, provides a huge reinforcement
###549 of symbolic permanence. But our ultimate psychological alchemy came when we
###553 managed to convince ourselves our symbolic self could exist outside
###557 our literal self.
###559 We called it a 'soul'.
###561 Once humans had committed this violation, there was really no end to the
###564 possibilities on offer.
###566 The soul could be reborn in another body --
###568 perhaps another species.
###570 It could be reinserted in the same body.
###572 It could even simply continue with nobody at all.
###576 On the face of it, the concept of the independent soul
###579 would seem to provide enough denial to keep everyone happy.
###583 So why isn't everyone happy?
###585 The problem with illusions is that they're devilishly difficult things to maintain.
###589 Not only do they constantly run up against reality -- they're also vulnerable to
###593 competing illusions.
###595 Group A denies death with a fantasy in which the soul departs to a paradise or
###600 realm of torture
###602 after one physical life.
###603 Group B denies death with a fantasy in which the soul just keeps getting
###607 reincarnated on Earth.
###609 When these fantasies meet
###611 there's gonna be a clash.
###612 The existence of the competing illusion serves as a constant contradiction to
###616 the other --
###617 undermining its death-denying capability.
###621 It soon becomes clear that, in order to keep a death-denying illusion going, everyone has
###626 to believe the same thing.
###627 Over the years, I've noticed a range of strategies to reduce the threat of
###631 conflicting ideas.
###633 They might simply be dismissed as ridiculous, implausible,
###637 maybe primitive.
###638 But however much we try to dismiss conflicting ideas psychologically,
###642 it's much better if they're just not there at all.
###644 History's festooned with aggressive proselytisation programmes,
###649 where one death-denying illusion is displaced by another.
###652 Sometimes the poison's sweetened by the addition of medical aid,
###655 or enhanced educational prospects,
###658 supporting the aggressors' delusion that they're 'helping the savages' -- rather than
###662 eliminating the competition.
###664 History also abounds with the more violent step up from that,
###668 when members of the competing death-denying illusion are exterminated.
###672 Where dismissal, proselytisation or murder seen non-viable,
###677 we have the truce.
###678 Here parties focus on common aspects between the illusions,
###682 while trying to downplay the threatening differences.
###685 Some folks have tried this with christianity and islam
###688 saying it's the same god.
###690 Problem is, it isn't the same god
###692 The god that gave its only son
###694 in explicit reference to a purported original sin
###698 is not the god that had no such son.
###700 This is not a minor detail that can be discarded.
###703 It informs the whole rationale for the belief.
###706 And beneath all the magnanimous gestures towards inclusion,
###710 multiculturalism and pluralism,
###712 these differences are not forgotten.
###715 The inherent supremacism of the individual's ideology merely moves from
###720 overt
###720 to covert.
###722 And when things get rocky,
###723 that supremacism is quick to surface.
###726 Out come the flags, the icons,
###728 and the feverish assertions
###730 of monoculture.
###733 Truces have an elastic limit. Finding common ground gets harder as differences
###737 between groups increase. When confronted with groups who have no divine beliefs
###742 at all, it is of course possible to offer a truce based on human values.
###746 But that tacitly acknowledges the redundancy of divine beliefs.
###751 Hence
###752 strategy number five: emotional blackmail. Here, folks attempt to coerce those who
###757 don't share their illusions into silence by evoking guilt or fear.
###762 Sometimes the blackmail his preemptive.
###764 The blackmailer lets it be known publicly that they couldn't bear it if anyone
###768 confronted their illusions.
###770 Other times, the blackmail's reactive.
###772 The blackmailer tries to stifle any further challenge with the same manipulative
###775 methods --
###776 casting folks who expose their illusions as cruel,
###780 destructive and heartless --
###782 hoping they'll be persuaded to mask their dissent.
###785 Whatever the strategy, the goal is the same. Unable to withstand scrutiny or challenge,
###789 the poorly constructed illusion can only survive by blocking
###794 them out.
###794 Having reflected on this death denial over several years, it was intriguing to
###799 come across experimental support last year, when my friend Tim introduced me to
###803 the work of Sheldon Solomon, Tom Pyszczynski
###806 and Jeff Greenberg --
###808 the proponents of 'terror management theory'.
###816 Sheldon Solomon explains:
###818 'If culture serves a death-denying function
###821 then if you remind people that they're going to die,
###823 that should momentarily .... increase the need for the death-denying aspects of
###826 their particular beliefs about reality --
###828 and that should be reflected by their reactions to other individuals, who
###832 either bolster or support those beliefs,
###834 or who undermine those beliefs by either being hostile to them,
###838 or merely different from them.
###840 The terror management team have conducted scores of studies to
###843 investigate this
###844 'mortality salience hypothesis'.
###847 In a study into attitudes, two groups of christian subjects were asked to
###851 fill out a questionnaire, ostensibly about how people form impressions of others.
###855 The questions in one group were specifically phrased to remind the reader
###858 of his or her own death.
###860 Both groups were then asked for their impressions of two fictitious students
###864 who shared personality traits.
###867 One student was a christian.
###868 The other was jewish.
###870 Subjects who'd been reminded of their own death gave an especially positive
###873 assessment of the christian and an especially negative one of the jew.
###877 The subjects who weren't reminded of their death showed no preference.
###881 Another study investigated the effects of mortality salience on behaviour,
###885 looking at subjects' willingness to use cultural symbols and icons in
###888 inappropriate ways.
###890 In the first of two tasks, subjects were given a variety of objects
###895 and asked sift sand from a jar with water and ink.
###899 The American flag was the only object that would do the job.
###903 In the second task,
###904 subjects had to hang a crucifix on the wall -- but in order to do that
###908 they had to use the crucifix to bang the nail in.
###911 Subjects who'd been reminded of death in a prior questionnaire
###914 took twice as long as those who hadn't.
###917 The researchers also looked into the effects of mortality salience on
###920 subjects' choice a political candidate,
###922 using campaign statements expressing three different leadership styles.
###926 The task-orientated leader's statement emphasised high but achievable goals
###931 implemented through efficient resourcing and delegation. The relationship-orientated
###935 leader's statement focused on respect, compassion, trust,
###940 communication
###941 and appreciation.
###942 The charismatic leader's statement alluded to the nation's greatness
###946 and stressed the importance of vision and group identity. Initially, only 4%
###951 voted for the charismatic leader,
###953 with the remainder fairly evenly split between the other two.
###957 But when subjects were reminded of death,
###959 votes for the charismatic leader soared to 33%.
###963 Interestingly,
###964 votes for the relationship-orientated statement fell sharply.
###968 The researchers noted how these results echoed George Bush's rise in popularity
###972 around the 9/11 attacks, with his appeals to the nation's greatness and
###977 righteous war against the axis of evil.
###980 In a subsequent experiment, the researchers found that reminders of both
###983 mortality and 9/11 significantly increased support for Bush --
###988 not just among conservatives
###990 but also liberals.
###991 As the researchers pointed out, we should be extremely concerned
###995 at how easy it is to manipulate an electorate's political preferences through
###999 appeals to a combination of nationalism and fear.
###1002 While it's natural to fear legitimate threats, we'd do well to keep some
###1006 rational perspective and demand facts, rather than allow ourselves to be seduced by
###1011 heroic, fear-based rhetoric.
###1016 In this video, I looked at the illusions we construct to deny death
###1021 and how they lead to divisive and disproportionate emotional responses
###1025 to folks who don't share those illusions.
###1028 In the second video, I'll be exploring several other grave subjects, including the label
###1033 of 'pro-mortality atheist', the demands of immortality, the claim that there are
###1038 'no atheists in foxholes', and the possibility of peace of mind without
###1042 recourse to illusion.
