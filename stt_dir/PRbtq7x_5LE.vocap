###7 THE MATURE SPERM IN THE EPIDIDYMIS
###9 WILL PASS OUT OF THE MAN'S BODY THROUGH EJACULATION
###13 200 TO 300 MILLION AT A TIME
###17 OR THEY WILL EVENTUALLY DIE AND BE REABSORBED.
###23 THESE SPERM CARRY THE MAN'S GENETIC MATERIAL
###26 AND THEY ARE FULLY MATURE.
###31 BUT THEY ARE NOT YET ABLE TO FERTILIZE A WOMAN'S EGG.
###35 THEY DO NOT ATTAIN THAT ABILITY
###38 UNTIL THEY ARE ACTUALLY FAR UP INSIDE THE WOMAN'S BODY.
###48 THEY MAY STAY IN THE EPIDIDYMIS
###50 THE BAG-LIKE STRUCTURE ON THE LEFT
###52 FOR SEVERAL WEEKS.
###57 WHILE HERE, THEY DEVELOP THE ABILITY TO SWIM.
###64 A SPERM PROPELS ITSELF
###67 BY MEANS OF A LONG TAIL, A FLAGELLUM
###70 WHICH LASHES VIGOROUSLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE.
###73 THIS EXTRAORDINARY ACTIVITY HAS BUT A SINGLE PURPOSE:
###77 TO DELIVER THE GENETIC MATERIAL IN THE SPERM'S HEAD
###82 QUICKLY AND PRECISELY TO THE WOMAN'S EGG.
###85 ON THE TIP OF THE SPERM'S HEAD IS A LAYER OF ENZYMES
###89 AND ENZYME INHIBITORS.
###91 THE INHIBITORS PRESERVE THE ENZYMES
###93 WHICH WILL BE NEEDED LATER
###96 TO PENETRATE THE SURFACE OF THE EGG.
###99 THIS IS HOW THE SPERM'S HEAD LOOKS WITHOUT ITS ENZYME CAP.
###104 THE MATERIAL OF THE HEAD ITSELF IS LOADED
###107 WITH THE ACTUAL GENETIC INFORMATION
###110 WHICH WILL BE TRANSMITTED TO THE EGG.
###112 THESE ARE THE STRANDS OF DNA
###115 WHICH WILL BE TRANSFORMED INTO CHROMOSOMES.
###120 THIS IS ONE OF THE MANY FUEL PACKETS
###123 ARRANGED ALONG THE MIDPIECE OF THE SPERM.
###126 THE FUEL CONSISTS OF SUGARS
###129 WHICH IS CONVERTED INTO ENERGY FOR THE SPERM'S LOCOMOTION.
###134 THE PROPULSION SYSTEM OF THE SPERM'S TAIL
###138 IS MADE UP OF A BUNDLE OF CORDS, OR FILAMENTS.
###144 THE FILAMENTS ARE COVERED WITH THOUSANDS OF TINY HOOKS.
###149 AS THE HOOKS INTERMESH, THE WHOLE BUNDLE BEGINS TO BEND
###153 AND THE TAILS OF THE SPERM BEGIN TO WHIP AROUND LIKE THIS.
###160 IT IS A PRIMITIVE, BUT HIGHLY EFFICIENT, SYSTEM OF PROPULSION.
###171 THE SYSTEM DOES NOT FUNCTION PERFECTLY EVERY TIME.
###179 ON THE AVERAGE, UP TO 20% OF A NORMAL MAN'S SPERM
###183 ARE DEFORMED OR IMPERFECT IN SOME WAY.
###190 PERHAPS ONE REASON WHY A MAN PRODUCES SO VERY MANY SPERM
###194 IS THAT SO VERY MANY THINGS CAN GO WRONG
###197 WITH THE SPERM THEMSELVES.
###202 THEY MAY HAVE TWO TAILS, LIKE THIS ONE.
###205 SOME EVEN HAVE THREE TAILS.
###210 IN ANOTHER COMMON DEFORMITY, THE HEADS OF THESE SPERM
###215 APPEAR TO BE NEARLY SEVERED FROM THEIR TAILS.
###218 THIS SPERM HAS BEEN ATTACKED BY BACTERIA.
###225 AND THIS ONE MAY HAVE BEEN PRODUCED TOO RAPIDLY.
###229 IT WILL NEVER COMPLETE ITS DEVELOPMENT.
###234 WHITE BLOOD CORPUSCLES, THE LARGE, ROUND CELLS
###238 ARE OFTEN FOUND TOGETHER WITH DEFECTIVE SPERM.
###241 THEIR PRESENCE INDICATES THE LIKELIHOOD
###244 OF INFECTION, FEVER OR EVEN A COMMON COLD.
###248 MOST OF THESE SPERM DEFORMITIES COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED
###251 BY JUST A SLIGHT ELEVATION
###253 IN THE TEMPERATURE OF THE TESTICLES.
###259 ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, TOO, OFTEN DAMAGE SPERM PRODUCTION.
###266 OVERCROWDING...
###270 STRESS...
###272 SMOKING...
###275 CHEMICAL POLLUTION OF AIR AND WATER...
###278 OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS...
###281 RADIATION...
###283 POOR NUTRITION...
###286 ALL PART OF MODERN LIFE.
###290 EVEN OUR MODERN CLOTHING MAY AFFECT SPERM PRODUCTION.
###295 TIGHT BLUE JEANS, FOR EXAMPLE
###297 HOLD THE TESTICLES UP CLOSE TO THE BODY
###299 PERHAPS RAISING THEIR TEMPERATURE
###302 THOSE FEW CRITICAL DEGREES.
###304 BUT IN SPITE OF SUCH OBSTACLES
###306 HUMAN BEINGS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY REPRODUCING
###309 FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS.
###314 SINCE THE FIRST ORGANISMS SWAM IN THE SEA
###317 THE CYCLE OF LIFE HAS BEEN CONTINUOUS
###320 FUELED BY THE NEED AND THE DRIVE TO REPRODUCE.
###328 AMONG HUMAN BEINGS
###331 THAT DRIVE IS INTIMATELY LINKED WITH ATTRACTION AND DESIRE.
###343 AFFECTION AND ROMANTIC LOVE MAY INITIATE THE DANCE OF COURTSHIP
###349 WHICH MAY LEAD TO CONCEPTION.
###361 SEXUALITY, AFFECTION AND TENDERNESS
###364 CAN ALL BE PART OF THE COMPLEX RITUALS OF MATING.
###381 BUT DESIRE AND PHYSICAL LOVE
###384 POSSESS A SILENT LANGUAGE ALL THEIR OWN
###388 THAT SIGNAL PARTNERS' READINESS TO EACH OTHER.
###393 THE EYES ARE PART OF THAT SILENT LANGUAGE.
###399 VISUAL IMPRESSIONS STIMULATE AND EXCITE SPECIAL NERVE CELLS
###403 IN THE SEXUAL AREAS THROUGHOUT THE BODY.
###409 THE SKIN, TOO, IS PART OF THE SILENT LANGUAGE.
###414 IT IS AMAZINGLY SENSITIVE AND RESPONSIVE TO THE TOUCH.
###421 IT CONTAINS MILLIONS OF THESE SENSORY RECEPTORS
###425 WHICH WHEN STIMULATED
###427 DIRECT MESSAGES OF SEXUAL AROUSAL TO THE BRAIN.
###430 MANY OF THESE ARE CONCENTRATED
###433 IN THE BODY'S MOST RESPONSIVE AREAS: THE EROGENOUS ZONES.
###437 ONE OF THESE, THE MAN'S PENIS
###439 IS DENSELY PACKED WITH SENSORY RECEPTORS--
###442 HERE SEEN AT ENORMOUS MAGNIFICATION.
###445 THEY RELAY MESSAGES OF SEXUAL STIMULATION TO THE BRAIN
###450 WHICH TRIGGERS THE COMPLEX SEQUENCE OF EVENTS
###453 LEADING UP TO EJACULATION.
###456 THE LENGTH OF THE PENIS IS MADE UP OF MANY SMALL CAVITIES
###459 CALLED ERECTILE TISSUE.
###462 WHEN A MAN IS SEXUALLY AROUSED, THE SIGNALS FROM THE BRAIN
###467 CAUSE THESE ERECTILE TISSUES TO BECOME ENGORGED WITH BLOOD.
###483 AS WE CAN SEE IN THESE IMAGES FROM THE THERMAL CAMERA
###488 THE SUDDEN FLOW OF BLOOD TO THE PENIS RAISES ITS TEMPERATURE.
###498 THE MAN'S BLOOD PRESSURE, HEARTBEAT
###501 AND RESPIRATION INCREASE.
###504 AND THE BLOOD CAUSES THE PENIS TO BECOME ERECT AND ELONGATED
###509 SO THAT SPERM CAN BE MOST EASILY DELIVERED TO THE WOMAN'S EGG.
###517 IN THE EPIDIDYMIS, THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF WAITING SPERM
###521 WHICH WILL SOON BE EXPELLED FROM THE MAN'S BODY
###524 ACCUMULATE IN A MASS.
###527 AS SEXUAL AROUSAL REACHES ITS PEAK
###530 THE ENTIRE MALE SEXUAL SYSTEM MUST FUNCTION PERFECTLY
###535 FOR EJACULATION TO TAKE PLACE.
###539 COWPER'S GLAND...
###544 PROSTATE...
###545 SEMINAL VESICLES...
###548 AND EPIDIDYMIS.
###557 THIS IS THE ACTUAL JOURNEY MADE BY THE SPERM.
###561 AT THE CLIMAX OF SEXUAL AROUSAL
###563 THE MAN'S NERVOUS SYSTEM TRIGGERS
###566 RAPID INVOLUNTARY CONTRACTIONS OF THE MUSCLES
###569 IN THE WALLS OF THE EPIDIDYMIS.
###572 THESE PROPEL THE SPERM UP INTO THE MAN'S BODY
###576 ALONG THIS TUNNEL-LIKE TUBE, THE VAS DEFERENS.
###580 THE SPERM THEMSELVES TRAVEL THE DISTANCE--
###584 A LITTLE OVER 12 INCHES-- IN ONLY A FEW SECONDS.
###594 THE SEMINAL VESICLES RELEASE NOURISHING FRUCTOSE
###598 WHICH BLENDS WITH THE SPERM AS THEY PASS BY.
###604 THEY MIX WITH THE PROSTATE FLUID.
###611 THE BLENDED SEMEN APPROACHES THE URETHRA.
###615 ITS TOTAL VOLUME IS ACTUALLY ABOUT ONE HALF A TEASPOON.
###625 THIS IS THE LAST LEG OF THE JOURNEY.
###633 THE SEMEN CONTAINING THE SPERM IS FORCED OUT THROUGH THE PENIS
###638 BY THE MAN'S MUSCLE CONTRACTIONS.
###646 AND AT LAST, IT IS EJACULATED INTO THE WOMAN'S VAGINA.
###676 AS THE SEMEN ENTERS THE WOMAN'S BODY
###679 IT IMMEDIATELY SLOWS DOWN AND COAGULATES.
###697 PERHAPS IT BECOMES THICKER
###700 TO ENSURE THAT MOST OF THE SPERM STAY WITHIN THE VAGINA
###704 OR PERHAPS THE COAGULATION IS A KIND OF DEFENSE
###708 FOR THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE VAGINA IS EXTREMELY ACID.
###714 THE ACIDITY PROTECTS THE WOMAN AGAINST BACTERIA AND INFECTIONS
###720 BUT IT IS ALSO DANGEROUSLY INHOSPITABLE TO THE SPERM.
###725 NEARLY ONE-QUARTER OF THEM WILL DIE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.
###737 ABOUT 20 MINUTES AFTER EJACULATION
###739 THE SEMEN BECOMES FLUID AGAIN.
###742 THE SURVIVING SPERM BECOME VIGOROUSLY ACTIVE
###745 SWIMMING RAPIDLY AGAINST THE DOWNWARD CURRENTS
###748 IN THE WOMAN'S BODY.
###752 THERE IS GREAT URGENCY
###754 FOR THE SPERM WILL REMAIN VIABLE-- ABLE TO FERTILIZE--
###758 FOR ONLY 28 TO 48 HOURS.
###768 THIS IS THE SOUND MADE BY THOUSANDS OF ACTIVE SPERM.
###772 (<i> rumbling</i> )
###785 THE SPERM'S GREAT ACTIVITY HAS BUT ONE GOAL:
###789 TO FIND AND FERTILIZE THE EGG.
###792 THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM THAT SUCCESS MIGHT SEEM ASSURED
###796 BUT THE BARRIERS, TOO, ARE NUMEROUS.
###804 THE HIGH PERCENTAGE OF DEFECTIVE SPERM
###807 HAS ALREADY LOWERED THE ODDS.
###817 SO HAS THE VAGINA'S HOSTILE, ACID ENVIRONMENT.
###835 AND THE WOMAN'S OWN DEFENSE SYSTEM ATTACKS THE SPERM.
###839 THEY ARE UNWELCOME CELLS FROM ANOTHER ORGANISM
###843 AND THEY ARE POTENTIAL ENEMIES.
###847 HER DEFENSE CELLS AGGRESSIVELY PROTECT HER FROM THE INVADERS
###851 BY DESTROYING THEM.
###867 THE SPERM ARE PROGRAMMED TO SEEK THE EGG
###870 BUT SOME OF THEM TRY TO FERTILIZE
###873 THE FIRST ROUND OBJECT THEY FIND--
###875 IN THIS CASE, AN ORDINARY BODY CELL.
###884 STILL, IN SPITE OF THE OBSTACLES
###886 HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SPERM
###888 MAKE THEIR WAY UP THROUGH THE VAGINA
###891 TO THE CERVIX-- THE MOUTH OF THE UTERUS--
###894 WHICH WILL LEAD TO THE FALLOPIAN TUBES AND THE EGG.
###910 THE CERVIX SECRETES STRANDS OF A SPECIAL FLUID PROTEIN
###913 CALLED MUCIN.
###917 DURING OVULATION, IT IS VERY LIQUID
###920 AND EASY FOR THE SPERM TO SWIM IN.
###930 THE STRANDS OF MUCIN PROVIDE TINY CHANNELS
###933 LESS THAN 1/100th OF A MILLIMETER WIDE
###937 DIRECTING THE SPERM CLOSER TO THEIR OBJECTIVE.
###945 BUT MANY OF THEM NEVER FIND THE STRANDS OF MUCIN
###949 AND THEY WILL DIE IN THE VAGINA.
###954 THOSE THAT SURVIVE
###956 WILL SWIM UP THE MUCIN CHANNELS TOWARD THE UTERUS.
###961 THEY SWIM IN DENSE BUNCHES.
###965 THE OUTER ONES MAY PROTECT THE INNER ONES
###968 FROM THE WOMAN'S ACIDITY AND DEFENSE SYSTEMS.
###977 ONCE INSIDE THE CERVIX
###979 THE SPERM CONTINUE ON THEIR JOURNEY.
###982 SOME REMAIN HERE
###985 PERHAPS TO PROVIDE A BACKUP FOR THOSE THAT CONTINUE ON.
###992 THE REST PROCEED UP THROUGH THE CAVITY OF THE UTERUS
###996 IN SEARCH OF THE EGG.
###1007 THEIR NUMBER IS NOTICEABLY REDUCED.
###1021 HERE, FROM INSIDE THE UTERUS
###1024 WE SEE THE OPENINGS TO THE TWO FALLOPIAN TUBES.
###1032 THE SPERM SWIM TOWARD THEM.
###1040 ONE LEADS TO THE WAITING EGG...
###1044 THE OTHER TO AN EMPTY TUBE.
###1053 ONLY HALF OF THE FEW REMAINING SPERM
###1056 WILL SWIM UP THE TUBE WHICH HOLDS THE EGG.
###1080 THE TUBES ARE LINED WITH MILLIONS OF TINY CILIA--
###1084 THE SAME CILIA WHICH HELPED DRAW THE EGG
###1087 FROM THE OVARY TOWARD THE UTERUS AT OVULATION.
###1091 THESE CILIA SWAY CONSTANTLY
###1093 CREATING A GENTLE DOWNWARD CURRENT
###1096 THAT THE SPERM MUST SWIM AGAINST.
###1109 SOME SPERM GET STUCK
###1111 IN AMONG THE CELLS LINING THE WALLS OF THE TUBE.
###1118 OTHERS LOSE THEIR SENSE OF DIRECTION.
###1129 DURING THIS PART OF THE SPERM'S JOURNEY
###1132 THE LAYER OF ENZYME INHIBITORS AT THE TIPS OF THEIR HEADS
###1136 IS SLOWLY BEING WORN AWAY.
###1140 THE SPERM ARE FULLY CAPACITATED AND ABLE TO FERTILIZE THE EGG
###1144 IF THEY EVER ENCOUNTER IT.
###1159 OF THE 200 MILLION SPERM THAT BEGIN THIS LONG JOURNEY
###1165 ONLY ABOUT 50 EVER REACH THE EGG.
###1172 THE EGG IS SURROUNDED BY TWO LAYERS OF THE NUTRITIVE CELLS
###1177 WHICH HAVE NOURISHED IT ON ITS JOURNEY IN THE FALLOPIAN TUBE.
###1185 THE SPERM IMMEDIATELY RELEASE THEIR DIGESTIVE ENZYMES
###1188 TO BREAK THROUGH THESE PROTECTIVE NUTRITIVE LAYERS
###1192 IN ORDER TO REACH THE EGG ITSELF.
###1198 AT BEST, ONLY ONE WILL EVENTUALLY ENTER
###1202 AND FERTILIZE THE EGG.
###1210 THE JOINT FORCE OF THEIR EXERTIONS
###1213 STARTS THE EGG ROLLING AROUND
###1216 LIKE A MYSTERIOUS CELESTIAL BODY.
