###0 HARMONY KORINE: All right, so we're going to look at some
###1 pictures today from the set of Spring Breakers.
###4 Behind the scenes shit.

###13 In between takes, the girls would blast, like, pop music,
###16 and Drake and stuff, and dance.
###19 They would be doing that mostly to keep themselves up
###22 and keep themselves in character and the momentum.
###24 
###27 Selena's character is a little more
###28 naive, and more religious.
###30 The other girls are super hardcore.
###32 
###36 I mostly knew her at that point from just peripherally,
###39 and from her show on Disney.
###42 But it seems to have built over the course of the making
###46 of this film into something approaching mania.
###52 I think she was nervous to do this sequence, because it
###54 required a lot of dudes rubbing up on her.
###56 I don't think she'd ever had that happen, so
###58 it was pretty intense.
###59 I remember there were a lot of dudes wanting to hump her, but
###62 she was a trooper.
###65 Looks like Vanessa and Ashley in ski masks.
###68 The pink ski masks with the unicorn patches was their
###70 robbing mode.
###71 Kind of [INAUDIBLE] gangster.
###74 The real robbery scene, where they're robbing tourists and
###77 stuff, they were pretty amped up.
###79 I usually shoot the scene from beginning to end, and just let
###82 them go through it all in real time.
###83 And so it was really like they were doing it.
###86 
###89 This is the girls getting arrested, the
###90 party at the motel.
###92 And this was hard, because there was paparazzi around,
###94 and sometimes there would be more people
###95 around than crew members.
###96 
###102 There's Selena and Rachel.
###104 Rachel was kind of trying to protect her, I think, in real
###107 life and it even just became a character trait in the film.
###111 They kind of became close friends.
###113 -[INAUDIBLE] miss something out there.
###116 HARMONY KORINE: Selena is crying in this sequence, and
###118 she was freaked out in real life.
###120 I didn't tell her about what was going to happen.
###122 This was something that I'd been saving in my mind for
###125 about three or four months before.
###127 I didn't want her to be prepared for it.
###129 I didn't want her to be thinking about it, so we just
###131 kind of threw it on her.
###133 And she was pretty freaked to do the sequence, but I think
###136 it's her best scene in the movie.
