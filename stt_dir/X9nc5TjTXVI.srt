1
0:0:3,52 --> 0:0:6,9
In many cases you start with the innovation, but it's not enough,


2
0:0:6,9 --> 0:0:8,4
you have to build something on top of that


3
0:0:8,4 --> 0:0:10,7
and that typically is the insight.


4
0:0:10,7 --> 0:0:14,43
That insight is how that innovation actually takes root,


5
0:0:14,43 --> 0:0:16,36
how it has impact, why it's meaningful.


6
0:0:16,36 --> 0:0:18,73
And I'd argue the type of entrepreneur that starts


7
0:0:18,73 --> 0:0:21,32
with the innovation usually is what I call an


8
0:0:21,32 --> 0:0:23,2
"innovation-based entrepreneur".


9
0:0:23,2 --> 0:0:25,31
But there is another typology of entrepreneurship,


10
0:0:25,31 --> 0:0:27,49
as a matter of fact that starts in a very different way.


11
0:0:27,49 --> 0:0:29,5
How many of you would start this way,


12
0:0:29,5 --> 0:0:32,92
start with the idea and then start to find a market for it?


13
0:0:32,92 --> 0:0:35,18
And maybe, okay, a lot of you are raising your hands.


14
0:0:35,18 --> 0:0:38,24
I think that's a typical modality, right?


15
0:0:38,24 --> 0:0:39,45
Ideas are inherently valuable,


16
0:0:39,45 --> 0:0:42,12
but ideas that are applied are invaluable.


17
0:0:42,12 --> 0:0:44,38
I would suggest that ideas that are left on your


18
0:0:44,38 --> 0:0:47,47
list that are not acted on are valueless.


19
0:0:47,47 --> 0:0:50,1
These are ideas that need to be released,


20
0:0:50,1 --> 0:0:53,83
make them available to society, don't leave them behind.


21
0:0:53,83 --> 0:0:56,31
I can't tell you and I bet some of you have been in that


22
0:0:56,31 --> 0:0:59,14
situation where some of the best ides you've had,


23
0:0:59,14 --> 0:1:2,91
you see someone else implement, you've that experience, right?


24
0:1:2,91 --> 0:1:5,3
You just let the world just pass you on by because


25
0:1:5,3 --> 0:1:7,1
you hadn't had the time to make it happen.


26
0:1:7,1 --> 0:1:9,66
Think about that leverage, the individuals who are doing two,


27
0:1:9,66 --> 0:1:12,69
three, four ideas at a time or working with teams of


28
0:1:12,69 --> 0:1:15,81
people to actually make these concepts available.


29
0:1:15,81 --> 0:1:19,43
You know, emulate them. Make that happen.


30
0:1:19,43 --> 0:1:21,26
The second piece is a game-changing solution.


31
0:1:21,26 --> 0:1:23,2
This is an ingredient that's really critical


32
0:1:23,2 --> 0:1:26,5
to high-performance entrepreneurship. What do I mean by that?


33
0:1:26,5 --> 0:1:29,31
Ultimately, as you look and this is a great illustration of all the things


34
0:1:29,31 --> 0:1:32,35
that are happening in the software and the web environment here,


35
0:1:32,35 --> 0:1:33,64
in the social media environment,


36
0:1:33,64 --> 0:1:35,24
and that it occurs to me that it's almost


37
0:1:35,24 --> 0:1:39,45
a daunting set of solutions, right?


38
0:1:39,45 --> 0:1:42,57
Which solutions are going to actually make their way through?


39
0:1:42,57 --> 0:1:44,84
You know, many of these started with, just like you started,


40
0:1:44,84 --> 0:1:47,22
an idea, but many of these solutions need


41
0:1:47,22 --> 0:1:49,69
to find their impact in the market.


42
0:1:49,69 --> 0:1:51,51
Only a few will make it through, right?


43
0:1:51,51 --> 0:1:53,72
There are certain applications,


44
0:1:53,72 --> 0:1:57,66
for instance, certain concepts that end up becoming platforms


45
0:1:57,66 --> 0:2:1,64
and then becoming kind of central to our lifestyles, right?


46
0:2:1,64 --> 0:2:3,58
It occurs to me when you look at your smartphone,


47
0:2:3,58 --> 0:2:7,12
for instance, how many of you have over 100 applications


48
0:2:7,12 --> 0:2:9,21
on your - apps on your iPhone now?


49
0:2:9,21 --> 0:2:11,96
Can I ask? More than 100 apps? Pretty common.


50
0:2:11,96 --> 0:2:14,37
How many do you use on a typical day?


51
0:2:14,37 --> 0:2:17,55
One, two, three, right, am I right?


52
0:2:17,55 --> 0:2:19,16
How many of you are developing apps, I'm just curious?


53
0:2:19,16 --> 0:2:23,1
How many of you are developing apps as we speak? Okay.


54
0:2:23,1 --> 0:2:26,3
What's it going to take to make yours a game-changing app?


55
0:2:26,3 --> 0:2:30,68
Think about it. What is it going to take to become a game-changer?


56
0:2:30,68 --> 0:2:32,76
That is what it's going to take.


57
0:2:32,76 --> 0:2:35,79
You've got to dial-in the notion of need,


58
0:2:35,79 --> 0:2:38,27
how ultimately is that need being satisfied,


59
0:2:38,27 --> 0:2:43,0
how is that pain ultimately being mitigated?


60
0:2:43,0 --> 0:2:44,89
I would argue that the intersection of opportunity


61
0:2:44,89 --> 0:2:47,1
and need is where the entrepreneur needs to live.


62
0:2:47,1 --> 0:2:51,0
Opportunity is the most exciting type of platform


63
0:2:51,0 --> 0:2:52,69
an entrepreneur lives in their life,


64
0:2:52,69 --> 0:2:58,16
but need ultimately crystallizes it. That's the acid test.


65
0:2:58,16 --> 0:3:0,2
I would argue that there's a class of entrepreneurs,


66
0:3:0,2 --> 0:3:3,26
you might be surprised by this, they don't start with an idea at all,


67
0:3:3,26 --> 0:3:5,32
they start maybe with the market try to understand


68
0:3:5,32 --> 0:3:7,87
what the problems are that we all face.


69
0:3:7,87 --> 0:3:10,61
As they're reading the blogs or as they're going through


70
0:3:10,61 --> 0:3:12,57
the web or as they're reading the newspaper,


71
0:3:12,57 --> 0:3:15,64
believe it or not, in the morning, they actually see compelling need.


72
0:3:15,64 --> 0:3:19,31
And on top of that, they define a real customer in their mind.


73
0:3:19,31 --> 0:3:22,45
They see a customer, I call that the beachhead.


74
0:3:22,45 --> 0:3:25,75
That need is critical. And I would argue that kind of entrepreneur


75
0:3:25,75 --> 0:3:27,23
is a marketplace entrepreneur.


76
0:3:27,23 --> 0:3:28,76
They don't start with the innovation,


77
0:3:28,76 --> 0:3:30,79
they start with the problem and then they


78
0:3:30,79 --> 0:3:33,3
acquire innovation to solve the problem.


79
0:3:33,3 --> 0:3:36,94
These are conjoined and they match.


80
0:3:36,94 --> 0:3:39,33
So, the market is my wisest teacher.


81
0:3:39,33 --> 0:3:42,34
Honestly, the market will tell you whether or not your idea is going


82
0:3:42,34 --> 0:3:45,64
to gain relevance because people will walk with their feet.


83
0:3:45,64 --> 0:3:48,61
The market is a beautiful crystallizing test,


84
0:3:48,61 --> 0:3:50,8
launch and learns where it's better than learn and launch,


85
0:3:50,8 --> 0:3:52,3
you know, I saw that Steve Blank was here,


86
0:3:52,3 --> 0:3:54,54
for instance, absolutely true,


87
0:3:54,54 --> 0:3:57,35
they're bringing the market into the equation much earlier.


88
0:3:57,35 --> 0:3:59,17
We'll hope it'd test your ideas to see if


89
0:3:59,17 --> 0:5:59,17
they actually will make their way through.
