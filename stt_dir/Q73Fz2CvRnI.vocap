###0 Say what you will about the healthcare system in this country,
###2 but when they're afraid of lawsuits, they sure test everything.
###6 I really don't think the colonoscopy was necessary.
###12 You know, before you got all swollen up,
###14 I actually thought you were trying to keep me out of the apartment
###16 so you could throw me a surprise party.
###19 Right, it's your birthday. I had no idea it was your birthday.
###22 I completely forgot. What a lousy way to spend a birthday.
###25 It's all over now.
###30 There is a party, isn't there?
###33 Maybe.
###37 - Are you mad? - How could I be mad?
###40 You actually risked your life because you care about me.
###45 Yeah, that's why I did it.
###50 All right.
###52 Here we go.
###54 My first birthday party.
###66 Dude,
###67 everybody left an hour ago.
###72 Surprise!
###78 Okay, Leonard. I am at your birthday party.
###81 I don't know where you are, dude, but it's really kick-ass!
###85 Everyone is very, very drunk and...
###90 And look, there's a girl taking her shirt off!
###95 That's my friend Carol.
###96 Remind me, I gotta introduce her to Howard.
###100 Oh, sweet Krishna, shake that rupee maker!
###105 I'm so sorry you didn't get your party.
###108 It's okay.
###111 Happy birthday, anyways.
###121 When's your birthday?
