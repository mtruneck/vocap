###3 Word up Food Tubers. Ok it's only a few days until Pancake Day! So we're gonna do a whole
###9 bunch of pancake recipes across Food Tube. So everybody's gonna have a little go, and
###14 today I'm gonna do a lovely little brunchy sort of L.A twist on fluffy pancakes with
###21 gorgeous smoky bacon. In the pancakes there's gonna be sweetcorn and feta cheese. There's
###26 gonna be avocado, it's gonna be gorgeous. But I have a new guest, yeah! Alex is here.
###33 French Guy Cooking is in the house. Hello Food Tubers how are you?
###38 Hi guys and welcome to French Guy Cooking. This is an amazing fruit. Then blaze it! We
###43 pour this over the steak. He's come here to cook and he's French. And
###48 he was one of the runner-uppers in the competition we did to find a new Food Tube star and he
###53 did fantastic and his channel is going down really well.
###56 I'm an Essex boy now. You are an Essex boy now. There's a few more
###60 initiations that we have to go through but you're nearly there, yes.
###63 And if you wanna see some pancakes, you wanna check out his channel. You gonna do a lovely
###67 Crepe? Oh yeah, totally. Sweet, sweet one.
###70 Beautiful. So are you ready to see my one? I'm waiting for it.
###73 It's not classic French. This is a really, really easy recipe guys. All you need is a
###78 tea mug, a builders mug, whatever you wanna call it. We're gonna pour this into the mug.
###84 See the thing is Alex, I don't really like weighing things too much. It's all about cups
###88 and spoons and handfuls. For one cup of self-raising flour we're gonna do one cup of milk. Do you
###94 mind pouring that in there for me. Yeah totally, totally. And one egg, Okay? And then a little
###99 pinch of salt. But if you can just whisk that for me my French brother. Yeah totally. But
###105 we're gonna go savoury. You don't want any lumps do you? You can try and get rid of the
###109 lumps, yeah. 20g of feta. But I wanna use a sweetcorn.
###113 We're gonna hold it like this and I'm gonna run my knife all the way down like this. So
###118 I'm just gonna take that off like that. How's it going Alex? It's good, it's perfect.
###124 Lovely, I would expect nothing less from you. Mmm. So Alex over here with the batter my
###129 friend. And what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna crumble some feta in there. We're gonna go
###135 in with the sweetcorn. I've got a pan here on a medium heat so I'm just gonna put in
###141 my rashers here. So Alex you've got your own channel now - French Guy Cooking.
###145 It is. Come on, tell them all about it.
###147 It really is a simple channel, you know, the most simple you can get French cooking to.
###151 I mean, hearty dishes, don't want to be Frenchy only. I want it to be, you know, worldwide;
###157 Asian twists, Italian, Lebanese. But that's nice, it's inspiring because it means if he
###163 can do it, you can do it. Ok push this down, let's get it crispy. It's
###168 totally amazing! It's smelling really good. We wanna just turn those over. Perfectly golden.
###173 The best bit at the moment happening here is like the caramelisation of the bacon, but
###179 the fat coming out. So I'm gonna use that fat to cook my pancakes. So the bacon's nearly
###185 there. I'm gonna do a very, very simple piece of avocado and I'm literally just gonna dress
###191 it in a little salt, a little pepper, just a little bit of lime zest over the top is
###197 very, very nice and a little lime juice. This will stop the avocado discolouring but it
###202 will just give it the most wonderful sort of flavour. And the whole point of this dish
###207 is it's comforting but also it wakes you up. So just remove the bacon, lovely and crisp.
###212 That goes here. Just gonna turn it down a little bit.
###215 So I'm gonna give you bacon fat. Give it a shake my brother. I wanna do nice, just a
###221 couple of little pancakes there, just like that.
###226 Can you do the same my friend? Beautiful. I'll try.
###231 It doesn't matter if they're not perfectly round. As my Nan used to say - it all goes
###235 down the same hole. What we wanna do is when these little bubbles
###237 come to the top here, right I'm gonna get in, under and just flip that bad boy over.
###243 Look at that! So the pancakes they're nearly done. I've
###245 got my bacon, I've got my avocado and of course I'm gonna take a couple of our lovely pancakes
###251 here. I'm gonna stack them up just like this. I'm gonna just hit up the bacon, just a couple
###261 of bits of that with some avocado. So a little bit of the old lime juice on the avocados
###268 and then just a little bit of yoghurt and.. Chilli sauce!
###272 Yes, chilli. And then just a little coriander. So there you go. That is my Californian style
###277 brunch. This one is for this lovely man right here. Thank you Jamie. There you go Alex.
###283 There's a fork to eat it with. And Alex is gonna make a beautiful French style Crepe
###288 with, tell us what's on the topping. I mean the topping will be a sweet one. we
###293 will have some caramel, some butter and you know, it's just sweetness. What do you call
###298 it in French? We call it Caramel beurre sale.
###301 Come on! If you want a little bit of Caramel beurre sale then click on his head right now,
###306 go through to his channel, don't forget to subscribe. If you're cooking pancakes on Pancake
###311 Day, or any day of the year, can you put the picture up on Instagram or Twitter, #MYPANCAKEDAY.

###329 Madame. Goodbye, see you.
