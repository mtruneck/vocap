According to police, a small
farmer named Ze Rodriguez had

ordered the assassination, which
was carried out by his

0:27:58,76 --> 0:28:2,72

299
0:28:2,72 --> 0:28:3,996
de Nascimento.


300
0:28:3,996 --> 0:28:5,93
The immediate reason for
the murder was a


301
0:28:5,93 --> 0:28:7,572
dispute over land.


302
0:28:7,572 --> 0:28:10,28
Ze Rodriguez had tried to

had stopped him.
