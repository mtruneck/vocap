###0 >> DRUMMOND: Another great day at Google. So I want to welcome everybody to the latest
###11 installment of Candidates at Google. For those of you who don't know me, I'm David Drummond,
###16 Senior Vice President of Corporate Development, the company's Chief Legal Officer. I'm very
###22 pleased and distinctly honored here to welcome back to Google Senator Barack Obama. I say
###33 welcome back because for those of you who were around in the summer of 2004, you may
###38 remember at TGIF in which I joined Larry and Sergey on this stage and introduced to the
###44 assembled Googlers then senate candidate Obama. And Barack had been in the Bay Area and he
###51 wanted to come down and see what we were up to here at Google, see what this Google thing
###56 was all about. And he had a great visit. He came and did the tour. He saw the GeoDisplay,
###61 the Search Traffic, and he saw the servers, and everything we had at Google. We sat down
###67 with Larry and Sergey. We had a great talk about innovation, about policy, and he later
###72 wrote about that in his book, The Audacity of Hope. And I know all of you have a copy
###79 of that. And all in all a great visit. And, you know, while it was a fantastic visit,
###85 I now realized that we made a grave error that day at TGI, we didn't let him speak.
###92 So, ladies and gentlemen, today, we are going to rectify that error. We are thrilled that
###100 Senator Obama has chosen Google to unveil his innovation agenda. And you're going to
###106 hear that today and we're very, very excited about what that means for the country and
###113 I think you will be too. Following that, Eric's going to come up on the stage and do a Q&A
###121 with Senator Obama. And following that, you'll have your chance to ask your question. So,
###125 without anything further, please join me in giving an enormous Google welcome back to
###132 Senator Barack Obama. Thanks. >> OBAMA: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you,
###167 every body. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. What a--what a wonderful reception.
###172 I am so grateful to all of you for showing such interest in taking the time to be here
###178 today. I want to thank Larry and Sergey and Eric and, obviously, David for helping to
###187 set this up. I am extremely grateful to all of them for their leadership and their friendship.
###193 And I also want to acknowledge state Senator Elaine Alquist who is here. This is her district,
###199 and since I used to be a state senator I always want to give her, her props, so it's wonderful
###204 to see her as well. So, thank you. Well, it is wonderful to be back. As David said I was
###215 here about 3 years ago and had just a wonderful visit. It was such a striking visit for me.
###222 It made such an impression that I ended up writing about it in my book. And so it's always
###227 good to be back in Mountain View and it's good to see that Google is maintaining its
###232 strict dress code.
###238 When you stop to think about it, there is something improbable about this gathering.
###245 After all it wasn't much more than a decade ago that Larry and Sergey got together in
###253 a dorm room as graduate students, with a big idea to organize all of the world's information
###259 into an accessible form. And at that time, I was an Illinois state senator doing my best
###265 to help people get a better shot at their dreams. What we shared is a belief in changing
###272 the world from the bottom-up, not the top-down. That a bunch of--that ordinary people can
###280 do extraordinary things. We shared that. We also shared a bunch of student loans that
###286 still needed to be paid off. And you would have found it hard to predict that Larry and
###293 Sergey would now be the co-founders of one of the most successful companies in recent
###297 history and that I would be standing on this stage today as a candidate for president of
###303 the United States. But this is where improbable journeys have led. This is where the moment
###312 finds us. And I'd like to say a few words about what I believe we have to do together,
###318 to seize this moment with a sense of purpose and a sense of urgency. We know how the first
###325 chapters of the Google story have turned out. After all, all of you have good jobs. But
###331 we also know that the Google story is more than just being about the bottom line. It's
###338 about seeing what we can accomplish when we believe in things that are unseen, when we
###343 take the measure of our changing times and we take action to shape them. And that's why
###348 we're here today, that's why many of you decided to work here instead of someplace else. Technology
###356 and innovation have reshaped our economy and our lives at breathtaking speed. America's
###362 been fighting to figure out how to tap this awesome new resource that we have, and Google
###369 has helped to show us the way. But the story is far from over. Google’s story is far
###375 from over. The story of how we shaped our changing times is far from over. What comes
###381 next depends on the choices that we make right now, at this moment, in this election. We
###388 could see the spirit of innovation that started this company be stifled. We could see the
###396 internet divided up to the highest bidders. We could see a government that uses technology
###401 to shut people out, instead of letting them in. Tax break shuffled to special interests
###408 while the next start-up, the next Google can't get a fair shot. Challenges like healthcare
###414 and energy that hold our country back while competition from other nations picks up. That's
###421 one alternative. Another alternative is for us to unlock a new future of opportunity.
###428 Together we could open up the government and invite all citizens in while connecting all
###434 of America to 21st century Broadband. We could use technology to help achieve universal healthcare,
###441 to reach for a clean energy future, and to ensure that young Americans can compete and
###447 win in the global economy. If America recommits itself to science and innovation, then we
###455 can lead the world to a new future of productivity and prosperity. That's what we can do if we
###461 seize this moment. That's the choice we face. And as president, I intend to work with you
###468 to write the next chapter in the story of American innovation. That's part of the reason
###474 why I'm running for president of the United States. To seize this moment, we have to ensure
###480 free and full exchange of information, and that starts with an open internet. I will
###487 take--I
###496 will take a backseat to no one in my commitment to network neutrality, because once providers
###503 start to privilege some applications or websites over others, then the smaller voices get squeezed
###509 out and we all lose. The internet is perhaps the most open network in history and we have
###515 to keep it that way. To seize this moment, we have to connect all of America to 21st
###521 century infrastructure. As president, I will set a goal of ensuring that every American
###527 has Broadband access, no matter where you live, no matter how much money you have or
###532 don't have. We will raise the standards for Broadband speed. We will connect schools and
###538 libraries and hospitals. And we’ll take on the special interest so that we can finally
###542 unleash the power of wireless spectrum for our safety, our security, and our connectivity.
###550 To seize this moment, we have to use technology to open up our democracy. It's no coincidence
###557 that one of the most secretive administrations in our history, has favored special interests
###562 and pursued policies that could not stand up to the sunlight. As president, I'm going
###567 to change that. We will put government data online in universally accessible formats.
###574 I'll let citizens--I'll let citizens check federal grants, contracts, earmarks, and lobbying
###586 contracts. I'll let you participate in government forums, ask questions in real time, offer
###593 suggestions that will be reviewed before decisions are made, and let you comment on legislation
###600 before it is signed. And to ensure that every government agency is meeting 21st century
###606 standards, I will appoint the nation's first chief technology officer to coordinate and
###611 make certain that we are always at the forefront of technology and that we are incorporating
###615 it into every decision that we make. And if you want to know how I'll govern, just look
###629 at our campaign. We’ve received over 370,000 donations online, half of which have been
###638 under $25. Nearly 300,000 Americans have their own accounts on BarackObama.com. They’ve
###648 created—they’ve created thousands of grassroots groups. They've offered up over 15,000 policy
###656 ideas, because we believe the real change can only come from the bottom-up, and technology
###662 empowers people to come together to make that change. Because at this moment, I think we
###668 have to do more than to get our house in order, the opportunity in front of us is bigger than
###673 that. Seizing this opportunity is going to depend on more than what the government does
###678 or even what the technology sector does. It's going to depend on how together we harness
###683 technology to confront the biggest challenges that America faces. Just imagine what we could
###689 do. If we commit ourselves to electronic medical records, then we can lift up the quality of
###694 healthcare and reduce error and dramatically lower costs. If we take on--if we take on
###705 special interests and make aggressive investments and clean a renewable energy like Google has
###710 done with solar here in Mountainview, that we can end our addiction to ore, create millions
###716 of jobs and save the planet in the bargain. If we make technological literacy a fundamental
###722 part of education then we can give our children the skills they need to compete and ensure
###727 the next generation of scientists and engineers as being educated right here in America. We
###735 can do this, but we can't wait because Silicon Valley is not the only corner of innovation
###741 in the world. If America doesn't seize this moment, then we will face only more competition
###747 from Dubai and Dublin, from Shanghai and Mumbai. So, instead of George Bush's policy of undermining
###755 science, I intend to double federal funding for basic research and make the R&D tax credit
###761 permanent. To keep--to keep the door open for the next generation of start-ups, I'll
###773 enforce tough anti-trust laws, and to ensure that America continues to track the world's
###779 best and brightest, we need comprehensive immigration reform that strengthens permanent
###785 resident visas like the H-1B program. We need to make sure that the next success story,
###798 the next Google, happens here in America. The Google stories about what can be achieved
###805 when we cultivate new ideas and keep the playing field level for new businesses. But it's also
###812 about not settling for what we've already achieved, it's about constantly raising the
###817 bar so that we're more competitive. And so we use technology to reach ever expanding
###822 horizons. You know, the first time I was back here in 2004, Larry showed me the image that
###830 tracks all the internet searches taking place in the world. I wrote about this in my book.
###836 And I saw the earth rotating on a flat panel monitor with the different lights for different
###842 languages marking all the traffic on this wondrous network, the network that didn't
###847 even exist when almost all of us here were born, almost. But what struck me wasn't the
###859 light on that globe; it was the darkness. Most of Africa, chunks of Asia, even parts
###868 of the United States, the disconnected corners of our interconnected world where the promise
###875 of the 21st century is being eclipsed by peril. You and I must not settle for anything less
###882 than an America that replaces that darkness with a new light, because the promise and
###888 prosperity of the new economy must not be the property of the few. It must be a force
###894 that lifts up our entire country and ultimately lifts up the entire world. We have the privilege to live in a transformational
###910 moment, a moment when an idea can change the world, a moment when technology empowers us
###917 to come together as never before while letting each of us reach for our own individual dreams,
###924 a moment when we can finally progress and move beyond the huge challenges that have
###929 stood in the way of progress for far too long. We cannot and we must not look back and regret
###938 that we settled for anything less. And that's why I'm asking you to join me in seizing this
###943 moment, I'm asking you to join me in changing the world. Thank you very much everybody.
###948 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Eric, come on up. Thank you.
###973 >> SCHMIDT: Brilliant. Brilliant. >> OBAMA: Thank you so much.
###973 >> SCHMIDT: Thank--thank you, Senator, for such a strong message about innovation.
###975 >> OBAMA: Thank you. >> SCHMIDT: Senator Obama, the product of
###980 a Kansas mother and a father from Kenya, born in Hawaii; your history, of course, Columbia,
###988 Harvard, state senator, now, senator running for president, welcome to Google.
###993 >> OBAMA: Thank you so much. Thank you. >> SCHMIDT: When you see yourself in the presidency
###1004 in 2008, 2009, and for many years, what is it that you're going to do that's exceptional?
###1013 What is your fundamental reason why you think this company--this country, excuse me, is
###1017 going to be--is going to be a great country? And by the way...
###1026 >> OBAMA: Is this the kind of interview that you guys want too?
###1030 >> SCHMIDT: And your book is really extraordinary, its title is The Audacity of Hope.
###1035 >> OBAMA: Yeah. Well, Eric, first of all, thanks, thanks for letting me be here, and
###1041 the reason that book is called The Audacity of Hope is it captures an idea that got me
###1047 into politics in the first place, which is that part of what has been great about America
###1053 is there’s a certain audacious quality, this belief that this ragtag bunch of revolutionaries
###1061 can overthrow the greatest empire on earth, start a government that we've never seen operate
###1067 before, spread across the continent, create the greatest economy and the greatest democracy
###1074 in our history, and then overcome barriers, both internal and external that would prevent
###1082 us from making progress. There's a certain confidence and boldness to the idea of America.
###1087 And the reason I'm running for president right now, because oftentimes people ask me, "Why
###1094 now?" You know, if I waited 10 years, I'd be still younger than most of the other candidates,
###1101 that's true. It is because I think we are at a defining moment in our history, our nation
###1113 is at war, the planet is in peril, ordinary Americans are working harder for less. They
###1120 feel as if the dream that generations fought for is slowly slipping away. There are costs
###1126 for everything, from healthcare to college have gone up. They're finding it more difficult
###1134 to save, difficult to retire, and they don't feel as if anybody in Washington is listening
###1138 to them. And when I made the decision, I sat down with my wife, and I asked myself three
###1143 questions: One, could my family survive the rigors of presidential campaign? And because
###1149 my wife is exceptional and my children are above average, we figured we could do it,
###1153 and they’ve been great. That's also true. The second question we asked was, "Could we
###1162 win?" And we determined that we could. But the third question was, I asked myself the
###1166 question you asked, because I think so much is at stake right now that running for president
###1171 can't be about just ambition this time, there's got to be a rationale. And what I concluded
###1176 is this; I believe I can more effectively bring this country together to solve problems
###1182 than on the other candidate. And, yeah, we have seen a gridlock where 45% of the country
###1190 is on one side, 45% of the country is on the other, we've got 10% in the middle, they all
###1194 live in Ohio and Florida apparently, and so, political contest just become beating down
###1202 the other side and eking out of victory one way or the other, but you can't govern. And
###1208 the problems we face, whether it's climate change or healthcare or our standing in the
###1214 world are so enormous that we have to govern, we have to make good decisions, so that's
###1219 number one. Number two, is I--I have taken on the special interest in the past and of
###1230 one and I've got an instinct of bias to push against the status quo, which I think is really
###1235 needed right now because Washington has become captive of special interest that are making
###1240 decisions not based on reason, not based on competition, not based on innovation, but
###1246 all too often based on who's got the most juice, who's got the most clout, and that
###1251 has to change. And the third--the third thing and this is the last thing is--you mentioned
###1262 in my background--I was shaped by a new global perspective. I grew up in Hawaii. I lived
###1273 in Indonesia. I have family all around the globe. And the damage that's been done over
###1281 the last seven years and outstanding in the world is so significant that we have to have
###1289 the next president engage in a level of personal presidential diplomacy that I think is unmatched
###1295 at least since World War II. And I believe that the day I'm inaugurated, the--not only
###1301 does the country look at itself differently but the world looks at America differently.
###1305 And I'm able to go to Africa and speak to them about development and problems of corruption
###1312 and our obligations towards that continent, and I could say--I've got a grandmother in
###1318 a small African village without electricity or running water. So I have a little credibility
###1325 that no other president could match. If I go to a Muslim leader, I can speak to them
###1330 and I can say, "I am a Christian but I live in the country with the largest Muslim population
###1335 in the world. And so, I don't assume a clash of civilizations. I think that there's something
###1342 we have in common that we can potentially build on. And I have a level of credibility
###1347 that no other president has. That I think is what's going to be necessary to lead us
###1352 out of the problems that we're in right now. >> SCHMIDT: You know--well. Now, Senator,
###1372 you're here at Google and I like to think of the presidency as a job interview. Now,
###1379 it's hard to get a job... >> OBAMA: Right.
###1382 >> SCHMIDT: As president... >> OBAMA: Right.
###1383 >> SCHMIDT: And--I mean, you're going to do a great job. It's also hard to get a job at
###1386 Google. >> OBAMA: Right.
###1387 >> SCHMIDT: We have questions and we ask our candidates questions. And this one is from
###1393 Larry Schwimmer. >> OBAMA: Okay.
###1393 >> SCHMIDT: What--you guys think I'm kidding, it's right here. What is the most efficient
###1402 way to sort a million 32-bit integers? >> OBAMA: Well...
###1409 >> SCHMIDT: Maybe--I'm sorry... >> OBAMA: No, no, no, no. I think--I think
###1413 the bubble sort would be the wrong way to go.
###1419 >> SCHMIDT: Come on. Who told him this? Okay. I didn't see computer science in your background.
###1427 >> OBAMA: We've got our spies in there. >> SCHMIDT: Well, why not--okay, let's ask
###1433 a different interview question. Well, obviously, more serious. You're notable in this campaign
###1446 for your steadfast opposition to the Iraq War.
###1451 >> OBAMA: Right. >> SCHMIDT: On the assumption that you're
###1454 elected president on day one, you'll walk in...
###1455 >> OBAMA: Yeah. >> SCHMIDT: And the war will probably still
###1456 be on. >> OBAMA: Yeah.
###1458 >> SCHMIDT: And we know your view that the war was a mistake.
###1461 >> OBAMA: Right. >> SCHMIDT: But here it is, you're at the
###1463 desk, what are you going to do? >> OBAMA: We will call in--I will call in
###1468 the Joint Chief of Staff, my Secretary Of State Nominee, my National Security Advisor
###1475 Nominee, and they will have a new mission, which is to end this war. And it appears based
###1485 on the advice that I've gotten from military commanders that we can safely bring out one
###1490 to two brigades per month. At that phase, we will have our combat troops out in sixteen
###1497 months. The only mission--we will not have permanent basis in Iraq and we will not have
###1506 combat operations in Iraq. The only mission that I will allow will be to protect our embassy
###1514 and our civilian personnel, diplomats, humanitarian workers and we will have a narrowly targeted
###1523 mission of if there are terrorist camps that are amassing in Iraq that we have a strike
###1530 capability. Now, it is important during those 16 months that we are redoubling our diplomatic
###1537 efforts. The reason that it is so important, I believe, to start getting our troops out
###1543 is because the Iraqi government has declined to negotiate with the various factions. The
###1550 Sunnis, the Shiites, the Kurds have not come together and arrive at the political accommodations
###1555 that are necessary to solve this problem. And we have not reached out to the regional
###1561 powers including Iran, Syria--so not just our friends, but also our enemies to arrive
###1568 at a workable and stable Iraq. And this is an argument that I've had with some of the
###1574 other candidates, including Senator Clinton in this race. And I think it's part of what
###1578 signals a break from Bush-Cheney diplomacy; the willingness to speak to our adversaries.
###1586 President Kennedy once said, "We should never negotiate out of fear, but we should never
###1590 fear to negotiate." And the notion that not talking to leaders we don't like makes us
###1595 look tough is fundamentally flawed. It makes us look arrogant and it sends a message to
###1601 the world that we're not listening. And if we change our diplomatic approach led by me,
###1608 the president of the United States, that I think will allow us to shift not just the
###1615 situation in Iraq but change the climate in the Middle East around the world. It will
###1621 give us more leverage then to deal with terrorist activity that's taking place in Afghanistan,
###1627 in the border areas around Pakistan and elsewhere in the region.
###1632 >> SCHMIDT: Let's ask about--let's ask about Iran, Guantanamo...
###1638 >> OBAMA: Right. >> SCHMIDT: Pakistan, give us your sense as
###1646 leader what you would do with all of these issues.
###1650 >> OBAMA: I will talk to Iran directly. That does not mean that we will be conceding any
###1658 positions with Iran. It means that we will listen and see where we can find common ground.
###1664 I think Iran is a grave threat to security. If they develop nuclear weapons, they could
###1671 trigger another arms race in the Middle East. It is indisputable that they have assisted
###1677 Hezbollah and Hamas in terrorist activity and--you know, their language, when it comes
###1682 to Israel is unacceptable. But what is also true is that we have repeatedly rebuffed gestures
###1691 that might allow for some resolution of these conflicts in a non-military way. And so, for
###1697 us to say to them, "You stand out on the nuclear issue and you may be able to join the World
###1702 Trade organization. You stop supporting terrorist activity; we are in a position to start normalizing
###1711 relations." Having those conversations face-to-face are important. Not--it may be that Ahmadinejad
###1719 rejects it, but it will send a message to Iranian people that they are not our enemy
###1726 and it sends a message around the world that we are doing business differently. Sarkozy,
###1731 President Sarkozy, I know you just met with him, Eric. He was quoted in the New Yorker
###1736 a while back, and he said--he was asked what's the most important thing America could do
###1742 to help you, and he said, "Be more liked." Be more liked. You know, and he wasn't joking
###1751 because when our standing is low, it gives us less leverage. We can't negotiate and maneuver.
###1757 Many people are concerned probably here about the genocide in Darfur. We would be in such
###1762 a stronger position to ensure there was a protective force on the ground and to save
###1767 people's lives if we had more credibility and more trust so that people--so that the
###1776 Khartoum government couldn't say that, "Oh, we're just trying to invade another Muslim
###1779 country." So that's on Iran. Pakistan--Pakistan is in a difficult situation right now. And
###1792 in some ways, we've got the worst of both worlds; we’ve got a military ruler who has
###1798 locked up political opposition and institute an emergency rule. So he's violating human
###1805 rights in Pakistan and he also has not dealt with terrorist activity inside his borders.
###1812 We need to reverse course. I've already said that we should suspend military that's not
###1818 related to--directly to hunting down terrorists. We should suspend that until military--emergency
###1824 rule is lifted and prisoners were released and they can proceed with what the Constitution
###1831 of Pakistan has called for. This is a mistake we repeatedly make. We think somehow and we
###1839 made this all throughout the Cold War. We think that by latching on to non-democratic
###1845 authoritarian rule, we somehow contain--in this case, Islamist extremism, it doesn’t
###1851 contain as Islamist extremism. It makes people believe that somehow the United States is
###1859 opposed to their liberty, opposed to their democracy. And that's not the side of history
###1864 that we want to be on. Now, we have to make sure that the nuclear weapons in Pakistan
###1870 are secure. And that has to be our number one priority and will be my number one priority
###1874 as president. But understand Pakistan--the democratic element in Pakistan, a big chunk
###1881 of this movement is secular, it is middle-class. And what they're seeking is for the kind of
###1888 political liberty that we hope for. Last point, Guantanamo, that's easy. We close down Guantanamo,
###1894 restore Habeas Corpus, say no to renditions, no to wireless wiretaps, you know, Part of
###1909 my job as the next president is to break the fever of fear that has been exploited by this
###1915 administration, that--you know, we're told--you know, we're told that we should be afraid
###1925 of terrorists and immigrants and each other, and it becomes the means by which our civil
###1937 liberties are subverted, our values are distorted, we start hearing our attorney general nominee
###1944 not being certain as to whether simulated drownings are torture. That's not who we are
###1951 as Americans. And sometimes I’m accused of being, you know, this progressive far--I'm
###1957 conservative in a sense that I want us to get back to those values that were essential
###1964 to building America. Well.... >> SCHMIDT: The--let's talk a little about
###1976 America, and the America that you see today is one of extremes. And in your campaign,
###1984 you've talked a lot about the people who are not the--the economic winners, the educational
###1989 winners, or whatever, and many people are responding very strongly and positively to
###1995 that message. >> OBAMA: Right.
###1996 >> SCHMIDT: Take us through what would be different. What are you going to do, how are
###2001 you going to deal with the very serious economic problems, educational problems, a set of problems
###2007 that we face here in the United States. >> OBAMA: Well, let's start with acknowledging
###2013 that our economy is out of balance. We have seen extraordinary economic growth and, obviously,
###2021 Google is a symbol of one sector of our economy that's just been extraordinary; innovative,
###2031 creative and lucrative, but there's a whole another part of America that has been left
###2042 behind. You know, if you look economically, all the growth over the last two decades is
###2048 essentially been captured by not just the top five percent, but really the top one percent.
###2054 And the average American worker's wages and incomes have flatlined; they're not making
###2064 progress. And they feel anxious about it, and because they feel anxious about it, they
###2070 are afraid of globalization. And that fear has been fed by our politics. Now, my strong
###2077 belief is that globalization is here to stay and it is a powerful potential tool for good.
###2084 But we've got to--but we've--but we have to make sure that everybody has the ability to
###2091 access what's good about globalization. And right now, people are locked up. So very specifically,
###2097 what would I do, I would transform our education system and that means that we invest in early
###2102 childhood education to close the achievement gap that exists right now. And that's not
###2111 just pre-kindergarten, I mean, it's zero over to three. From the moment the child is born,
###2114 if they're born to an at-risk parent, we're going to that parent and we are helping them.
###2118 If that parent can't read, we'll teach the parent to read so they can read to their child.
###2122 But make sure they're prepared for school. That's step number one. The--in terms of K
###2128 through 12, we know that the most important element other than the parent in the child's
###2135 learning is the teacher. So we--I will be a president who stops talking about how great
###2140 teachers are and actually starts rewarding them for being great by paying them more money.
###2155 We need to pay them higher salaries. We have to give them more professional development,
###2161 especially in their early years where they start and we have to change how we asses progress
###2168 for teachers because No Child Left Behind has created a situation where people are being
###2173 taught just the standardized test. They're not being thought art, they're not being thought
###2177 music, and it is stifling for the teacher and for the student. Now, we have to have
###2182 high standards, but those standards have to build on what is best about the American education
###2187 system, which is innovation, and creativity. So that we have to take or we have to make
###2193 college way more affordable. And one way to--one way I will immediately do that is get to banks
###2201 and financial institutions out of the business of providing student loans. You can take billions
###2206 of dollars of profits with the direct loan program. So that's on the education front.
###2210 We have to make investments in Broadband line and infrastructure so that we are competitive.
###2216 There has to be lifelong learning available so that people can continually retrain. I
###2221 mean, you know, I will steal a phrase from--I think it was Tony Blair who said that, "We
###2232 can't guarantee employment for everybody, but we can guarantee that everybody is employable."
###2239 And that means that people have to be able to constantly transition in terms of their
###2244 ability to adapt to new circumstances. And technology can play a critical role in that,
###2250 but we've got to make sure that it's accessible and available to every person. And the last
###2254 point I would make is that we've got to rebuild our social safety net that has not been adapted
###2264 since FDR. So, we've got to make sure that healthcare is available even when you lose
###2274 your job, that you have a retirement account that follows you with the job. Part of the
###2280 reason where an innovative society is--that we've always felt that, you know what, if
###2285 we take a risk and we make a misstep, that there's some cushion there for--not just us
###2292 but for our families as well. And that's why universal healthcare is so important, that's
###2298 why creating new systems for--to help people say this is so important, so that we'll actually
###2302 spur on people's willingness to take risks in the marketplace. Right now, they don't
###2307 feel as if they're able to do so. >> A couple of final questions from me and
###2318 then we'll ask some audience questions. I had a privilege. I was watching 60 Minutes
###2324 and I saw an interview with yourself and your wife, Michelle, and there were a number of
###2328 questions to you and then they asked--asked your wife about it, and excuse, it’s rather
###2333 a personal question. It's a question about race.
###2334 >> OBAMA: Uh-hmmm. >> SCHMIDT: How did she feel about race, the
###2337 dangers of presidency and so forth, and she looked straight in the camera and she said,
###2342 "I worry more about my husband walking down the street from the Senate than anything else."
###2349 At that moment, I understood the gap and perception between people of races in America. And it
###2358 was made vivid to me how different her view and my view would be. The same question.
###2363 >> OBAMA: All right. >> SCHMIDT: Can you talk a little bit about
###2365 that issue in America? >> OBAMA: Absolutely. Look, the W. B. Du Bois
###2372 said that the problem of the 21st--the problem of the 20th century is the problem of the
###2377 colored one. And if you expand that, the problem of the 21st century is the problem of the
###2386 other, people who are not like us, whether it's in religious terms. If you go to Sri
###2392 Lanka, it's, you know, what's been fueling as a vicious civil war there even though everybody
###2399 looks exactly the same, same with--in Northern Ireland, or it manifests itself in this country
###2406 in racial terms. And that--it has always been a nagging problem. There have been reports
###2413 just this week that African-Americans feel more pessimistic than they have in a very
###2417 long time and there's statistics that bear out. Why--how they in fact have not kept pace
###2427 when it comes to economic growth in this country. The virulent and anti-immigrant sentiment
###2434 that we're seeing all across the country is something that has been striking. I mean,
###2440 just in the last two years, you're seeing a shift where, you know, I fought for comprehensive
###2445 immigration reform two years ago and we didn't succeed, but there wasn't this raw anger about
###2453 it that you see now even when I'm campaigning among Democrats sometimes. So part of what
###2461 I believe I bring to this office is somebody who sees the world through a variety of different
###2468 races. My mother was white, my father was African. I grew up in Hawaii. I've got a sister
###2474 who's half Indonesian. She's married to a Chinese Canadian. You know, I've said...
###2479 >> SCHMIDT: It sounds like Google. >> OBAMA: Yeah. It's--my family would fit
###2484 right in here, no doubt about it. But people talk about our federal budget deficit, right?
###2495 We have an empathy deficit. We aren’t able to see the world through other people's eyes.
###2500 And that's what I think I can provide. Now, very concretely, what we need to do when it
###2506 comes to issues of race, I think a lot of the tensions are tied to economics. African-Americans
###2513 and Latinos are much more likely to be unemployed, employed in lower-wage jobs, will not have
###2520 healthcare, and be in substandard schools, drops out of school. So on in every indicator,
###2528 they're doing worse. And that contributes to that gap in perceptions that you're talking
###2534 about because, you know, the glass often looks half empty to a lot of African-American and
###2539 Latino children. And so, part of our job in investing an early childhood education or
###2546 making sure that they're going to outstanding schools, or insuring equality of opportunity
###2553 when it comes to employment, enforcing our Civil Rights laws, investigating crimes like
###2562 news is being hanged in classrooms. All that contributes to a sense that these kids matter
###2568 to us, that they're not those kids, they’re our kids, and when we can have a culture and
###2577 a government that perceives every child as mattering, and then they will respond differently.
###2584 And I think we will start stitching together the kind of America that all of us hope and
###2590 dream for. >> SCHMIDT: That's promising, absolutely riveting.
###2595 Let's get a couple of questions from the audience. I've also got--why don't you go ahead--and
###2599 I've also got some that were submitted that we also ranked, so, go ahead.
###2604 >> First of all, thank so much for coming. Your words are really inspiring.
###2607 >> OBAMA: Thank you. >> And we really appreciate it. You know,
###2610 I've been voting for quite few a years, a little older than the average Googler. And…
###2611 >> OBAMA: Yeah, you know, you, like, look like you might almost be my age.
###2618 >> Maybe a little older. >> OBAMA: Yeah.
###2621 >> And, you know, Bill Clinton is the only Democrat elected in the last 30 years. And
###2627 he's the only Democrat elected twice since World War II.
###2631 >> OBAMA: Right. >> I'm tired of losing.
###2633 >> OBAMA: Right. >> So, what have you learned from Clinton
###2638 that is going to make you win? What are you going to do differently? And what have you
###2643 learned from Gore and from Kerry and all those guys that you're going to avoid so that history
###2649 doesn’t reoccur? >> OBAMA: Well, first of all, I think--there's
###2652 a lot to learn from Bill Clinton. I mean, one of the things that Clinton did I think
###2657 was recognize the moment. We were in a particular moment in 1991-'92 when the Democrats had
###2669 not wrung out the excesses of the '60s and the early '70s, we were still deeply invested
###2678 in identity politics and interest group politics. And the Democratic Congress wasn’t showing
###2686 itself adaptable and shaking off some of the orthodoxies of the past. And he came in and
###2691 he said, "You know what? I'm a different kind of Democrat, and I'm willing to do things
###2695 in some new ways." And that was a powerful message for that moment. The reason I'm running
###2704 and the reason I believe I'm going to win is because we are in a different moment. So
###2708 you can't just copy what Bill Clinton did, but you have to take the same approach. What
###2712 is it that's needed right now? And I believe that what's needed right now is the capacity
###2718 to bring people together to think in practical reasoned ways about big problems that we face
###2726 to be straight with the American people about--and honest with them about the challenges that
###2731 we face. So part of what our message is built around is that we are in this defining moment
###2737 and we can't keep doing the same things that we've been doing that haven’t been working.
###2743 So that's point number one. What I've learned in terms of how Democrats lose? Democrats
###2750 lose when they are not clear about what they stand for. Democrats lose when they are attacked,
###2758 and because they don't know where they stand, they end up getting defensive instead of going
###2764 on the offensive. So, let me give you a very specific example, I am looking forward to
###2769 having a debate with whether it's Rudy Giuliani or Mitt Romney about the fear mongering that
###2777 has dominated the Republican debate of, like, where they're going to say I'm going to double
###2782 Guantanamo. Or, I'm going to, I think torture is okay. Or, you know, at least we'll redefine
###2790 torture. So torture is not okay, but these things that look on off are like--like it,
###2795 are okay. Or we need to do whatever it takes to read people's e-mails. And I am looking
###2804 forward to having that debate. But the problem we have is when we get defensive, and we're
###2809 not sure about our beliefs and our convictions, and so we start trying to sound a little bit
###2816 like them, and that is a profound mistake. One of the things that my wife and I, we said
###2822 to ourselves when we got into this race is if we start sounding like anybody--everybody
###2827 else, then what's the point, you know? I should go work for Google, you know, it'll be more
###2832 fun. >> SCHMIDT: You answered the question correctly.
###2835 >> OBAMA: I did answer the question correctly. So making sure that we're clear about where
###2843 we stand, honest with the American people, seizing the moment and recognizing that we
###2851 have to deal with climate change now, we have to deal with healthcare now. We have to revamp
###2860 our education system now. We have to double our investment and research and science now
###2868 and understanding that we don't have a lot of time to waste. That I think is going to
###2874 be a compelling message for the American people. Thank you. Thanks.
###2884 >> SCHMIDT: We--okay, thank you very much, Senator. We have an electronically submitted
###2887 question dealing with federal deficit. >> OBAMA: Okay.
###2887 >> SCHMIDT: What concrete steps will the Obama Administration take to address the federal
###2890 government's deficit and debt? What specific tax measures and program changes will you
###2895 recommend to Congress? >> OBAMA: This has been the fiscally the most
###2900 irresponsible administration that we have seen. I mean, we have increased the national
###2905 debt, almost doubled it since George Bush took office. It is now over $9 trillion. And
###2915 that is money that we're all going to have to pay back. So, the first thing that we have
###2923 to do is to bring an end to this war in Iraq. We're spending $10 to $12 billion per month.
###2929 The latest request for both Iraq and Afghanistan are $196 billion for next year. One year,
###2940 a $196 billion. That is money that could be providing health insurance to all Americans.
###2950 It could be rebuilding our schools. It could be providing higher teachers’ salaries.
###2955 It could be providing scholarships for every American, young persons going to college.
###2961 So we are using our resources in a way that's not sound. We can recapture some of that money.
###2970 Some of it will go to taking care of our veterans, some of it should go to social programs, and
###2977 some of it should go towards deficit reduction. Second principle is a very similar principle
###2983 called Pay Go. If you want to cut taxes, you’ve got to cut spending, if you want to raise
###2987 spending, you got to raise revenue, so that you have honest accounting. Right now, the
###2993 federal budget is not honest. And unless we have good numbers, we can't end up dealing
###3002 with this budget issue. Now, the biggest problem we have in terms of our budget though long
###3006 term. And look, I want to eliminate no-bid contracts. I want to scrub the federal budget
###3015 free of earmarks and pet projects that are not based on our national priorities and that
###3022 require transparency in government. I talked earlier about the power of technology. One
###3026 of the things that we've done, you'll be pleased to know that we call this the Google for Government
###3030 bill and… >> SCHMIDT: Google is in favor of it.
###3036 >> OBAMA: Yes. And what it does is we're going to set up a searchable database for every
###3040 dollar of federal spending so that we can track it, which means that we'll be able to--journalist
###3045 and ordinary citizens and think tanks and, you know, advocacy groups will be able to
###3050 see it. There are moneys going to a bridge to nowhere instead of going to a bridge to
###3056 somewhere. We'll be able to challenge it in real time and that's going to be important.
###3061 But the last thing I was going to mention--and this is probably the biggest problem we have
###3064 with the federal budget is healthcare spending; Medicare and Medicaid. That's the big budget
###3070 buster. That's the scary thing out there that it will be, like, the blop. It will just consume
###3077 everything unless we do something about it now. And again, technology is part of the
###3082 answer. And innovation is going to be part of the answer in reducing these costs. The
###3087 reason that healthcare cost is skyrocketing is not so much that the population is getting
###3092 older, that contributes a little bit to it, but the main problem is healthcare inflation
###3096 goes up six, eight, ten percent per year. It's unsustainable. And so for example, if
###3105 we use Health I. T., just simple stuff, making sure that everybody's medical records are
###3113 on digital--in a digital form, so that when a nurse pulls up somebody's chart, they can
###3121 actually read the writing, and they’re not administering the wrong drug. Making sure
###3127 that billing is all electronic. That can make a huge difference, investing and prevention,
###3132 so that children are getting regular check-ups instead of having to go to the emergency room
###3139 for treatable illnesses like asthma. That makes an enormous difference. That will probably
###3143 be the biggest savings item for our federal budget if we do it right. And people like
###3149 yourselves can be a part of that process. >> SCHMIDT: Thank you. Ethan.
###3153 >> ETHAN: Thank you, Senator Obama, for coming to visit us. And we’re really pulling for
###3157 you out here in the Bay area. >> OBAMA: Thank you.
###3158 >> ETHAN: I'm a big supporter and a vocal supporter, and the biggest issue that I constantly
###3164 hear brought up about you is the lack of experience, the inexperience issue.
###3168 >> OBAMA: Right. >> ETHAN: And I heard about it amongst my
###3172 friends, you read about that in the press, I'm sure you’ve had the answers to lots
###3173 of questions about it, without getting into--frankly, I guess you can--but without getting whether
###3177 experience makes a difference or not, but what you’re actually going to do to address
###3181 this perceived weakness and allow a lot of voters that want to get behind you and want
###3187 to support you to get past this issue of inexperience. >> OBAMA: Right. Well, look. The--first of
###3192 all, Sergey and Larry didn’t have a lot of experience starting a fortune 100 companies.
###3203 And it's a--and I suppose when they came in, we're talking to Dave Drummond about incorporating
###3213 Google. You could have said, "Duh, these guys don't know what they’re doing." But, you
###3221 know, what we're looking for, I believe, when it comes to leadership is judgment, vision,
###3231 character. And that's what I bring to bear in this race. I have the experience of bringing
###3242 people together to get things done that I would put up against any candidate in this
###3248 race. When I was in Illinois, I expanded healthcare to Illinoisians by getting Democrats and Republicans
###3255 to agree and work together. We were able to reform a death penalty system that was broken
###3260 by getting law enforcement and Civil Rights advocates to agree on things that people said
###3268 was--were impossible, but I was able to get it done, probably, because I'm pretty good
###3272 at listening to people and finding common ground. I've also got the ability to stand
###3280 up for what I believe in even when it's unpopular, which I think is the quality that the next
###3286 president has to provide. I mean part of the reason I was opposed to the war--I was opposed
###3292 to the war in Iraq back in 2002 when George Bush was at 65%, I didn’t just stumble into
###3298 that. It was based on having thought through what the consequences would be, understanding
###3304 that I was running in the U.S. Senate race, and I might lose my race, but I thought that
###3309 it was important to speak out forcefully on what I believed in. I think that's what the
###3315 next president has to offer. And I know how to choose talent, get smart people around
###3323 me who are capable and independent and bring together a variety of different points of
###3330 views and then set a vision and move in the same direction, that, more than anything is
###3337 what we need. We're not looking for a Chief Operating Officer when we select a president.
###3344 What were looking for is somebody who will say--will chart a course and say, "Here's
###3349 where America needs to go. Here's how we need to solve our energy crises. Here's how we
###3354 need to revamp our education system," and then gather the talent together and mobilize
###3360 that talent to achieve that goal and to inspire a sense of hope and possibility. So one way
###3366 to answer this question is to say, "Look, the guy has been in the public service for
###3369 20 years. He's a constitutional law professor. He was a Civil Rights lawyer. He did X, Y,
###3376 and Z in the state legislature. He's done all these wonderful things in the United States
###3380 Senate." But I think the main way to respond is to say, "This is all about judgment and
###3386 character." And also, I think, a little sense of impatience because part of the reason I'm
###3393 running is I'm impatient with the status quo. And what we've seen out of Democrats and Republicans--what
###3402 we’ve seen from Democrats and Republicans is a certain willingness to tolerate, what
###3413 I consider to be an intolerable status quo. And I think the American people feel that
###3417 same frustration. So, thank you. >> SCHMIDT: Thank you. Then we have our--we're
###3424 going to have our, unfortunately, our last question, so why don't you go ahead.
###3426 >> Senator, you said you had a bias to act against special interest.
###3432 >> OBAMA: Yeah. >> But if special interests were having a
###3435 perverting influence on the entire legislative process, what can you propose as president
###3440 that can make it through that process intact? >> OBAMA: Yeah, it is the classic question
###3446 of how do you get insiders to fix the system that they’re benefiting from, and it's hard.
###3453 You have to use shame. No, and I mean it. I'll give you an example. Last year, I passed
###3462 the toughest ethics reform legislation since Watergate. And I worked with Russ Feingold
###3469 and we eliminated corporate gifts or gifts from lobbyists, meals from lobbyists, and
###3475 corporate jets from lobbyists. We required the disclosure of campaign contributions that
###3480 were bundled from lobbyists. And I'll be honest with you, when we first started, it wasn’t
###3486 just resistance from Republicans, there were Democrats who didn’t want to see this happen
###3492 either. But what I knew was that if you stuck with it and you got it to the floor where
###3501 the people had to vote, then it was going to be hard for them to vote against it. So
###3506 part of the key for any reform is going to be getting the American people to pay enough
###3518 attention, that members of Congress start worrying, "You know what, the American are
###3523 looking at us. And so we better change how we behave," that's why this Google for Government
###3531 is so important because it--that's why transparency generally is so important in this entire process
###3538 because the more American people know, the more government is going to be held accountable.
###3544 And I'll give you just one very specific example around healthcare. I've mention that I want
###3549 to set up a system where every American has healthcare that's at least as good as the
###3553 healthcare I've got as a member of Congress. And if people want to--and if you’re interested
###3561 in the details of the healthcare plan, you can go to my website, barackobama.com. But
###3569 people asked me, "Well, why do you think you can get it done and overcome the insurance
###3573 and the drug companies to spent a billion dollars over the last decade preventing the
###3577 reform from happening in lobbying and campaign contributions?" And what I tell them is, "Yeah,
###3584 I respect what the Clintons tried to do in 1993, in moving health reform forward." But
###3590 they made one really big mistake and that is they took all their people and all their
###3595 experts into a room and then they close the door and they try to design the plan in isolation
###3603 from the American people. And during that period of time, the insurance companies and
###3608 the drug companies, and the HMOs they mobilized, and by the time the Clintons announced their
###3613 plan, you already have this Harry and Louise heads up, you guys don't remember this, you
###3617 weren’t born, maybe, I'm teasing. You were six. But these ads were out there that convinced
###3627 the American people they should be afraid of healthcare reform. Now, I will do it entirely
###3632 differently. Within the first 100 days of my administration, we are going to have a
###3638 big table, and everybody is going to be invited; laborer, employers, doctors, nurses, hospital
###3645 administrators, patient advocate groups, the drug and insurance company, they’re all
###3649 going to sit at the table, they just won't get to buy every chair. And we will work on
###3658 this process publicly. It will be on C-SPAN. It will be streaming over the net. And every
###3666 time we hit a glitch where somebody says, "Well, no, no, no, we can't lower drug prices
###3670 because of, yeah, RND cost that drug companies need." Well, we'll present data and facts
###3681 that make it more difficult for people to carry the water of their special interest
###3686 because it's public. And if they start running Harry and Louise ads, I'll make my own ads
###3690 or I'll send out something on YouTube, I’m president, and I'll be able to--I'll let them
###3698 know what the facts are. But, you know, one of the things that you learn when you’re
###3706 traveling and running for president is the American people at their core are a decent
###3711 people. There's a generosity of spirit there and there's common sense their, but it's not
###3717 tapped. And many people are--they are just misinformed or they’re too busy, they're
###3723 trying to get their kids to school, they're working, but they just don't have enough information
###3727 or just they're not professionals at sorting out all information that's out there. And
###3731 so our political process gets skewed, but if you give them good information, their instincts
###3737 are good and they will make good decisions. And the president has the bully pulpit to
###3741 give them good information, and that's what we have to return to as a government where
###3747 the American people trust the information they’re getting. And I'm really looking
###3752 forward to doing that because I am a big believer in reason, in facts, in evidence, in science,
###3758 in feedback, everything that allows you to do what you do, that's what we should be doing
###3764 in our government. I want people in technology. I want innovators and engineers and scientists
###3772 like yourselves, I want you helping us make policy based on facts, based on reason. You
###3780 know, one of my favorite stories I have from Washington is Daniel Patrick Moynihan, he
###3784 was a giant of the Senate and a very, you know, towering intellect. And he got an argument
###3792 one time with another senator, and the other senator apparently was losing the argument,
###3798 and so he got kind of huffy, and he said, "Well, Pat, you know, you're entitled to your
###3802 opinion and I'm entitled to mine." And Moynihan says, "You are entitled to your own opinion,
###3807 but you’re not entitled to your own facts." And part of the problem that we're having
###3814 and special interests exploit this is we constantly have a contest where facts don't matter. And
###3824 I want to restore that sense of decisions being based on facts to the White House. And
###3834 I think that many of you can help me, so I want you to be involved. Thank you so much
###3838 everybody. >> SCHMIDT: Thank you.
###3838 >> OBAMA: Thank you. >> SCHMIDT: Senator, thank you very much.
###3838 >> OBAMA: Thank you.
