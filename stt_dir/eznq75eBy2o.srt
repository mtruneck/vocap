0:0:12,47 --> 0:0:14,773
Professor Paul Bloom:
So, most of what we do these


2
0:0:14,773 --> 0:0:16,172
days – our methods,
our theories,


3
0:0:16,172 --> 0:0:17,818
our ideas – are shaped,
to some extent,


4
0:0:17,818 --> 0:0:21,1
by Piaget's influence.
And so, what I want to do is


5
0:0:21,1 --> 0:0:25,643
begin this class that's going to
talk about cognitive development


6
0:0:25,643 --> 0:0:29,696
by talking about his ideas.
His idea was that children are


7
0:0:29,696 --> 0:0:32,425
active thinkers;
they're trying to figure out


8
0:0:32,425 --> 0:0:34,807
the world.
He often described them as


9
0:0:34,807 --> 0:0:37,9
little scientists.
And incidentally,


10
0:0:37,9 --> 0:0:44,47
to know where he's coming from
on this, he had a very dramatic


11
0:0:44,47 --> 0:0:48,257
and ambitious goal.
He didn't start off because he


12
0:0:48,257 --> 0:0:51,171
was interested in children.
He started off because he was


13
0:0:51,171 --> 0:0:54,8
interested in the emergence of
knowledge in general.


14
0:0:54,8 --> 0:0:57,591
It was a discipline he
described as genetic


15
0:0:57,591 --> 0:1:1,27
epistemology – the origins of
knowledge.


16
0:1:1,27 --> 0:1:4,51
But he studied development of
the individual child because he


17
0:1:4,51 --> 0:1:7,427
was convinced that this
development will tell him about


18
0:1:7,427 --> 0:1:10,19
the development of knowledge
more generally.


19
0:1:10,19 --> 0:1:13,26
There's a very snooty phrase
that--I don't know if you ever


20
0:1:13,26 --> 0:1:15,349
heard it before.
It's a great phrase.


21
0:1:15,349 --> 0:1:19,34
It's "Ontogeny recapitulates
phylogeny."


22
0:1:19,34 --> 0:1:23,995
And the idea of this--What that
means is that development of an


23
0:1:23,995 --> 0:1:28,349
individual mimics or repeats
development of the species.


24
0:1:28,349 --> 0:1:32,519
Now, it's entirely not true,
but it's a beautiful phrase and


25
0:1:32,519 --> 0:1:35,566
Piaget was committed to this.
He was very interested in


26
0:1:35,566 --> 0:1:37,816
saying, "Look.
We'll figure how a kid develops


27
0:1:37,816 --> 0:1:41,176
and that will tell us about the
development of knowledge more


28
0:1:41,176 --> 0:1:44,173
generally."
So, Piaget viewed the child as


29
0:1:44,173 --> 0:1:47,418
a scientist who developed this
understanding,


30
0:1:47,418 --> 0:1:49,41
these schemas,
these little,


31
0:1:49,41 --> 0:1:52,14
miniature theories of the
world.


32
0:1:52,14 --> 0:1:56,83
And they did this through two
sorts of mechanisms:


33
0:1:56,83 --> 0:2:1,296
assimilation and accommodation.
So, assimilation would be the


34
0:2:1,296 --> 0:2:6,409
act of expanding the range of
things that you respond to.


35
0:2:6,409 --> 0:2:10,593
Piaget's example would be a
baby who's used to sucking on a


36
0:2:10,593 --> 0:2:14,56
breast might come to suck on a
bottle or on a rattle.


37
0:2:14,56 --> 0:2:19,3
That's changing the scope of
things that you respond to.


38
0:2:19,3 --> 0:2:23,729
Accommodation is changing how
you do it.


39
0:2:23,729 --> 0:2:26,766
A baby will form his mouth
differently depending on what


40
0:2:26,766 --> 0:2:29,984
he's sucking on.
And so, these processes where


41
0:2:29,984 --> 0:2:34,5
you take in--I'm giving this in
a very physical way,


42
0:2:34,5 --> 0:2:36,322
but in a more psychological
sense you have a way of looking


43
0:2:36,322 --> 0:2:38,552
at the world.
You could expand it to


44
0:2:38,552 --> 0:2:41,24
encompass new things,
assimilation.


45
0:2:41,24 --> 0:2:45,376
But you could also change your
system of knowledge itself –


46
0:2:45,376 --> 0:2:48,515
accommodation.
And Piaget argued that these


47
0:2:48,515 --> 0:2:52,803
two mechanisms of learning drove
the child through different


48
0:2:52,803 --> 0:2:55,15
stages.
And he had a stage theory,


49
0:2:55,15 --> 0:2:58,89
which was quite different from
the Freudian stage theory that


50
0:2:58,89 --> 0:3:2,813
we have been introduced to.
So his methods were to ask


51
0:3:2,813 --> 0:3:7,8
children to solve problems and
to ask them questions.


52
0:3:7,8 --> 0:3:10,978
And his discoveries that--they
did them in different ways at


53
0:3:10,978 --> 0:3:14,81
different ages led to the
emergence of the Stage Theory.


54
0:3:14,81 --> 0:3:19,193
So, for Piaget,
the first stage is the


55
0:3:19,193 --> 0:3:24,879
sensorimotor stage or the
sensorimotor period.


56
0:3:24,879 --> 0:3:31,3
For here the child is purely a
physical creature.


57
0:3:31,3 --> 0:3:35,609
The child has no understanding
in any real way of the external


58
0:3:35,609 --> 0:3:38,184
world.
There's no understanding of the


59
0:3:38,184 --> 0:3:41,368
past, no understanding of the
future, no stability,


60
0:3:41,368 --> 0:3:45,56
no differentiation.
The child just touches and


61
0:3:45,56 --> 0:3:48,78
sees, but doesn't yet reason.


62
0:3:48,78 --> 0:3:52,55



63
0:3:52,55 --> 0:3:56,63
And it's through this stage
that a child gradually comes to


64
0:3:56,63 --> 0:3:57,76
acquire object permanence.


65
0:3:57,76 --> 0:4:0,86



66
0:4:0,86 --> 0:4:5,52
Object permanence is the
understanding that things exist


67
0:4:5,52 --> 0:4:9,973
when you no longer see them.
So those of you in front,


68
0:4:9,973 --> 0:4:14,364
you're looking at me and I go.
It occurred to me it'd be a


69
0:4:14,364 --> 0:4:16,28
great magic trick if I then
appeared in back.


70
0:4:16,28 --> 0:4:19,759
But no, I'm just here.
That's object permanence.


71
0:4:19,759 --> 0:4:23,162
If I went under here and then
the people said,


72
0:4:23,162 --> 0:4:27,759
"Where the hell did he go?
Class is over," that would show


73
0:4:27,759 --> 0:4:31,762
a lack of object permanence.
So, adults have object


74
0:4:31,762 --> 0:4:35,573
permanence.
Piaget's very interesting claim


75
0:4:35,573 --> 0:4:39,75
is that kids don't.
Before six-month-olds,


76
0:4:39,75 --> 0:4:42,197
Piaget observed,
you take an object the kid


77
0:4:42,197 --> 0:4:44,576
likes like a rattle,
you hide it,


78
0:4:44,576 --> 0:4:48,589
you put it behind something,
it's like it's gone.


79
0:4:48,589 --> 0:4:52,149
And he claimed the child really
thinks it's just gone.


80
0:4:52,149 --> 0:4:55,612
Things don't continue to exist
when I'm not looking at them


81
0:4:55,612 --> 0:4:58,678
anymore.
And so he noticed they--they're


82
0:4:58,678 --> 0:5:1,872
surprised by peek-a-boo.
And Piaget's claim was one


83
0:5:1,872 --> 0:5:4,694
reason why they're surprised at
peek-a-boo is you go--you look


84
0:5:4,694 --> 0:5:6,285
at a kid,
the kid's smiling and go,


85
0:5:6,285 --> 0:5:8,562
"Oh, peek-a-boo," and you
close--and you cover your face


86
0:5:8,562 --> 0:5:10,59
and the kid says,
"He's gone."


87
0:5:10,59 --> 0:5:13,75
"Peek-a-boo."
"Oh, there he is.


88
0:5:13,75 --> 0:5:17,999
He's gone."
And you really--That's the


89
0:5:17,999 --> 0:5:20,798
claim.
Piaget also discovered that


90
0:5:20,798 --> 0:5:25,419
older children fail at a task
that's known as the A-not-B


91
0:5:25,419 --> 0:5:27,484
task.
And Peter Gray in his


92
0:5:27,484 --> 0:5:31,698
psychology textbook refers to it
as the "changing hiding places"


93
0:5:31,698 --> 0:5:35,11
problem, which is probably a
better name for it.


94
0:5:35,11 --> 0:5:38,187
And here's the idea.
You take a nine-month-old and


95
0:5:38,187 --> 0:5:41,782
for Piaget a nine-month-old is
just starting to make sense of


96
0:5:41,782 --> 0:5:46,31
objects and their permanence.
You take an object and you put


97
0:5:46,31 --> 0:5:49,372
it here in a cup where the kid
can't see it,


98
0:5:49,372 --> 0:5:52,314
but it's in the cup.
So the kid, if you were the


99
0:5:52,314 --> 0:5:55,58
kid, will reach for it.
You do it again, reach for it.


100
0:5:55,58 --> 0:5:57,879
You do it again, reach for it.
That's point A.


101
0:5:57,879 --> 0:6:1,9
Then you take--you move it over
here.


102
0:6:1,9 --> 0:6:3,97
Piaget observed kids would
still reach for this.


103
0:6:3,97 --> 0:6:6,77
It's like they're not smart
enough to figure out that it's


104
0:6:6,77 --> 0:6:9,29
not there anymore,
even if they see it move.


105
0:6:9,29 --> 0:6:13,365
And this was more evidence that
they just don't understand


106
0:6:13,365 --> 0:6:17,929
objects, and that this thing
takes a lot of time and learning


107
0:6:17,929 --> 0:6:20,554
to develop.
The next stage is the


108
0:6:20,554 --> 0:6:24,48
preoperational stage.
The child starts off grasping


109
0:6:24,48 --> 0:6:29,139
the world only in a physical
way, in a sensorimotor way,


110
0:6:29,139 --> 0:6:31,996
but when he gets to the
preoperational period the


111
0:6:31,996 --> 0:6:36,77
capacity to represent the world,
to have the world inside your


112
0:6:36,77 --> 0:6:40,61
head, comes into being.
But it's limited and it's


113
0:6:40,61 --> 0:6:43,529
limited in a couple of striking
ways.


114
0:6:43,529 --> 0:6:48,61
One way in which it's limited
is that children are egocentric.


115
0:6:48,61 --> 0:6:53,9
Now, egocentrism has a meaning
in common English which means to


116
0:6:53,9 --> 0:6:55,379
be selfish.
Piaget meant it in a more


117
0:6:55,379 --> 0:6:58,38
technical way.
He claimed that children at


118
0:6:58,38 --> 0:7:1,734
this age literally can't
understand that others can see


119
0:7:1,734 --> 0:7:6,395
the world differently from them.
So, one of his demonstrations


120
0:7:6,395 --> 0:7:9,788
was the three mountains task.
We have three mountains over


121
0:7:9,788 --> 0:7:11,865
there.
You put a child on one side of


122
0:7:11,865 --> 0:7:15,192
the mountains and you ask him to
draw it, and a four- or


123
0:7:15,192 --> 0:7:19,358
five-year-old can do it easily,
but then you ask him to draw it


124
0:7:19,358 --> 0:7:23,98
as it would appear from the
other side and children find


125
0:7:23,98 --> 0:7:27,794
this extraordinarily difficult.
They find it very difficult to


126
0:7:27,794 --> 0:7:31,61
grasp the world as another
person might see it.


127
0:7:31,61 --> 0:7:36,797
Another significant finding
Piaget had about this phase of


128
0:7:36,797 --> 0:7:41,529
development concerns what's
called "conservation."


129
0:7:41,529 --> 0:7:46,635
The notion of conservation is
that there's ways to transform


130
0:7:46,635 --> 0:7:51,914
things such that some aspects of
them change but others remain


131
0:7:51,914 --> 0:7:54,646
the same.
So, for instance,


132
0:7:54,646 --> 0:7:59,936
if you take a glass of water
and you pour it into another


133
0:7:59,936 --> 0:8:4,261
glass that's shallow or tall,
it won't change the amount of


134
0:8:4,261 --> 0:8:6,472
water you have.
If you take a bunch of pennies


135
0:8:6,472 --> 0:8:9,11
and you spread them out,
you don't get more pennies.


136
0:8:9,11 --> 0:8:12,924
But kids, according to Piaget,
don't know that and this is one


137
0:8:12,924 --> 0:8:16,725
of the real cool demonstrations.
Any of you who have access to a


138
0:8:16,725 --> 0:8:18,509
four- or five-year-old,
[laughter]


139
0:8:18,509 --> 0:8:21,86
a sibling or something--Do not
take one without permission,


140
0:8:21,86 --> 0:8:24,177
but if you have access to a
four- or five-year-old you can


141
0:8:24,177 --> 0:8:26,22
do this yourself.
This is what it looks like.


142
0:8:26,22 --> 0:8:29,111
The first one has no sound.
The second one is going to be


143
0:8:29,111 --> 0:8:31,69
sound that's going to come on at
the end.


144
0:8:31,69 --> 0:8:33,59
But there's two rows of
checkers.


145
0:8:33,59 --> 0:8:37,37
She asks the kid which one has
more.


146
0:8:37,37 --> 0:8:43,162
The kid says they're the same.
Then she says--Now she asks him


147
0:8:43,162 --> 0:8:47,31
which one has more,
that or that.


148
0:8:47,31 --> 0:8:51,601
So that's really stupid.
And it's an amazing finding


149
0:8:51,601 --> 0:8:55,12
kids will do that and it's a
robust finding.


150
0:8:55,12 --> 0:8:58,49
Here's another example.
So, they're the same.


151
0:8:58,49 --> 0:9:7,529



152
0:9:7,529 --> 0:9:11,919
So, it's a cool finding of that
stage, suggesting a limitation


153
0:9:11,919 --> 0:9:15,23
in how you deal and make sense
of the world.


154
0:9:15,23 --> 0:9:17,426
The next phase,
concrete operations,


155
0:9:17,426 --> 0:9:20,626
from seven to twelve,
you can solve the conservation


156
0:9:20,626 --> 0:9:23,439
problem,
but still you're limited to the


157
0:9:23,439 --> 0:9:26,429
extent you're capable of
abstract reasoning.


158
0:9:26,429 --> 0:9:31,85
So the mathematical notions of
infinity or logical notions like


159
0:9:31,85 --> 0:9:34,99
logical entailment are beyond a
child of this age.


160
0:9:34,99 --> 0:9:38,37
The child is able to do a lot,
but still it's to some extent


161
0:9:38,37 --> 0:9:41,641
stuck in the concrete world.
And then finally,


162
0:9:41,641 --> 0:9:45,929
at around age twelve,
you could get abstract and


163
0:9:45,929 --> 0:9:50,163
scientific reasoning.
And this is the Piagetian


164
0:9:50,163 --> 0:9:56,141
theory in very brief form.
Now, Piaget fared a lot better


165
0:9:56,141 --> 0:10:2,49
than did Freud or Skinner for
several reasons.


166
0:10:2,49 --> 0:10:5,23
One reason is these are
interesting and falsifiable


167
0:10:5,23 --> 0:10:8,948
claims about child development.
So claims that--about the


168
0:10:8,948 --> 0:10:12,702
failure of conservation in
children at different ages could


169
0:10:12,702 --> 0:10:15,679
be easily tested and
systematically tested,


170
0:10:15,679 --> 0:10:18,25
and in fact,
there's a lot of support for


171
0:10:18,25 --> 0:10:20,377
them.
Piaget had a rich theoretical


172
0:10:20,377 --> 0:10:23,558
framework, pulling together all
sorts of observations in


173
0:10:23,558 --> 0:10:25,976
different ways,
wrote many, many books and


174
0:10:25,976 --> 0:10:28,57
articles and articulated his
theory very richly.


175
0:10:28,57 --> 0:10:30,74
And most of all,
I think, he had some really


176
0:10:30,74 --> 0:10:32,618
striking findings.
Before Piaget,


177
0:10:32,618 --> 0:10:35,35
nobody noticed these
conservation findings.


178
0:10:35,35 --> 0:10:38,355
Before Piaget,
nobody noticed that babies had


179
0:10:38,355 --> 0:10:41,769
this problem tracking and
understanding objects.


180
0:10:41,769 --> 0:10:44,99
At the same time,
however, there are limitations


181
0:10:44,99 --> 0:10:49,343
in Piaget's theory.
Some of these limitations are


182
0:10:49,343 --> 0:10:52,418
theoretical.
It's an interesting question as


183
0:10:52,418 --> 0:10:55,899
to whether he really explains
how a child goes from a concrete


184
0:10:55,899 --> 0:10:59,629
thinker to an abstract thinker,
or how he goes from not having


185
0:10:59,629 --> 0:11:2,85
object permanence to
understanding object permanence.


186
0:11:2,85 --> 0:11:5,519
There's methodological
limitations.


187
0:11:5,519 --> 0:11:8,95
Piaget was really big into
question and answer,


188
0:11:8,95 --> 0:11:11,342
but one problem with this is
that children aren't very good


189
0:11:11,342 --> 0:11:13,936
with language,
and this might lead you to


190
0:11:13,936 --> 0:11:16,9
underestimate how much they
know.


191
0:11:16,9 --> 0:11:20,23
And this is particularly a
problem the younger you get.


192
0:11:20,23 --> 0:11:24,493
Methodology is going to loom
heavy in the discussion of any


193
0:11:24,493 --> 0:11:27,36
science and that includes
psychology.


194
0:11:27,36 --> 0:11:32,45
Often 90% of the game is
discovering a clever method


195
0:11:32,45 --> 0:11:35,72
through which to test your
hypotheses.


196
0:11:35,72 --> 0:11:38,429
We're going to talk a little
bit about that regarding babies.


197
0:11:38,429 --> 0:11:41,49
I'll give you another example
from a very different domain.


198
0:11:41,49 --> 0:11:45,97
There was a set of scientists
interested in studying tickling.


199
0:11:45,97 --> 0:11:49,196
So, when you tickle somebody,
under what circumstances will


200
0:11:49,196 --> 0:11:51,106
they laugh?
Where do you have to tickle


201
0:11:51,106 --> 0:11:52,61
them?
Can you tickle yourself?


202
0:11:52,61 --> 0:11:55,179
Does it have to be a surprise,
and so on?


203
0:11:55,179 --> 0:11:58,149
It turns out very difficult to
study this in a lab.


204
0:11:58,149 --> 0:11:59,529
You're not going to have your
experimental credit.


205
0:11:59,529 --> 0:12:0,66
You come into the lab and say,
"Okay.


206
0:12:0,66 --> 0:12:3,19
I'm the graduate student.
Ha, ha, ha."


207
0:12:3,19 --> 0:12:5,305
And [laughter]
in fact, an example of a


208
0:12:5,305 --> 0:12:8,756
methodological attempt was done
by Henry Gleitman at University


209
0:12:8,756 --> 0:12:11,751
of Pennsylvania,
who built a tickle machine,


210
0:12:11,751 --> 0:12:15,514
which was this box with these
two giant hands that went


211
0:12:15,514 --> 0:12:17,829
"r-r-r-r."
This was a failure because


212
0:12:17,829 --> 0:12:20,54
people could not go near the
tickle machine without


213
0:12:20,54 --> 0:12:24,521
convulsing in laughter.
But we will discuss when we


214
0:12:24,521 --> 0:12:29,95
have a lecture on laughter a bit
of the tickle sciences.


215
0:12:29,95 --> 0:12:33,887
And finally there's factual.
What do infants and children


216
0:12:33,887 --> 0:12:36,748
really know?
It's possible that due to the


217
0:12:36,748 --> 0:12:40,73
methodological limitations of
Piaget, he systematically


218
0:12:40,73 --> 0:12:44,269
underestimated what children and
babies know.


219
0:12:44,269 --> 0:12:46,461
And in fact,
I'll present some evidence


220
0:12:46,461 --> 0:12:49,75
suggesting that this is in
fact--that this is the case.


221
0:12:49,75 --> 0:12:54,555
So, I want to introduce you to
the modern science of infant


222
0:12:54,555 --> 0:12:57,115
cognition.
Infant cognition has been


223
0:12:57,115 --> 0:12:59,62
something studied for a very
long time.


224
0:12:59,62 --> 0:13:3,308
And there was a certain view
that has had behind it a


225
0:13:3,308 --> 0:13:7,21
tremendous philosophical and
psychological consensus.


226
0:13:7,21 --> 0:13:11,71
And it's summarized in this
Onion headline here.


227
0:13:11,71 --> 0:13:17,68
And the idea is that babies are
stupid, that babies really don't


228
0:13:17,68 --> 0:13:20,855
know much about the world.
Now, the work that this


229
0:13:20,855 --> 0:13:23,787
Onion headline is
satirizing is the recent


230
0:13:23,787 --> 0:13:26,227
studies,
which I'm going to talk about,


231
0:13:26,227 --> 0:13:29,704
suggested that on the contrary,
babies might be smarter than


232
0:13:29,704 --> 0:13:31,773
you think.
And to discover the


233
0:13:31,773 --> 0:13:35,958
intelligence of babies we have
to ourselves be pretty smart in


234
0:13:35,958 --> 0:13:39,705
developing different techniques.
To study what a baby knows,


235
0:13:39,705 --> 0:13:43,61
you can't ask your questions.
Babies can't talk.


236
0:13:43,61 --> 0:13:46,638
You could look at what it does
but babies are not very


237
0:13:46,638 --> 0:13:50,9
coordinated or skilled so you
need to use clever methods.


238
0:13:50,9 --> 0:13:55,399
One clever method is to look at
their brain waves [laughter].


239
0:13:55,399 --> 0:13:58,919
This child on the right died
during testing.


240
0:13:58,919 --> 0:14:1,42
It was a tragic--It was crushed
by the weights [laughter]


241
0:14:1,42 --> 0:14:3,45
of the electrodes.
He's happy though.


242
0:14:3,45 --> 0:14:6,169
You could study their brain
waves.


243
0:14:6,169 --> 0:14:9,423
One of the few things babies
can do is they could suck on a


244
0:14:9,423 --> 0:14:10,867
pacifier.
And you might think,


245
0:14:10,867 --> 0:14:12,769
well, how could you learn
anything from that?


246
0:14:12,769 --> 0:14:15,569
Well, for instance,
you could build machines that


247
0:14:15,569 --> 0:14:18,951
when babies suck on a pacifier
they hear music or they hear


248
0:14:18,951 --> 0:14:21,61
language,
and then you could look at how


249
0:14:21,61 --> 0:14:25,409
much they suck on the pacifier
to determine what they like.


250
0:14:25,409 --> 0:14:29,91
But undeniably we know most of
our--we got most of our


251
0:14:29,91 --> 0:14:35,9
knowledge about babies from
studies of their looking times.


252
0:14:35,9 --> 0:14:39,659
That's one thing babies can do.
They can look.


253
0:14:39,659 --> 0:14:42,906
And I have up here--This is a
picture of Elizabeth Spelke,


254
0:14:42,906 --> 0:14:45,981
who is a developmental
psychologist who's developed the


255
0:14:45,981 --> 0:14:49,227
most research on looking at
babies' looking times and what


256
0:14:49,227 --> 0:14:52,491
you could learn from them.
And I have here two ways you


257
0:14:52,491 --> 0:14:55,87
could learn from looking.
One is preference.


258
0:14:55,87 --> 0:14:58,236
So for instance,
suppose you want to know,


259
0:14:58,236 --> 0:15:0,948
for whatever reason,
do babies like the looks of


260
0:15:0,948 --> 0:15:3,859
dogs or cats?
Well, you could put a baby


261
0:15:3,859 --> 0:15:8,236
down, have a picture of a dog
here, a picture of a cat here,


262
0:15:8,236 --> 0:15:11,129
and see which one the baby
looks at.


263
0:15:11,129 --> 0:15:14,409
Babies can move their eyes and
that could tell you something.


264
0:15:14,409 --> 0:15:18,129
Do babies distinguish pretty
faces from ugly faces?


265
0:15:18,129 --> 0:15:20,65
Well, put a pretty face here,
an ugly face here,


266
0:15:20,65 --> 0:15:23,44
see if the baby prefers to look
at the pretty one.


267
0:15:23,44 --> 0:15:28,48
You could also do habituation
and surprise.


268
0:15:28,48 --> 0:15:31,457
And much of the studies I'm
going to talk about here involve


269
0:15:31,457 --> 0:15:35,524
habituation and surprise.
Habituation is a fancy word for


270
0:15:35,524 --> 0:15:38,267
boredom.
What you do is you show a baby


271
0:15:38,267 --> 0:15:42,393
something over and over again.
Now, remember from behaviorism


272
0:15:42,393 --> 0:15:45,83
the baby will learn this isn't
very interesting.


273
0:15:45,83 --> 0:15:48,45
Then you show the baby
something different.


274
0:15:48,45 --> 0:15:52,124
If the baby really sees it as
different, the baby will look


275
0:15:52,124 --> 0:15:56,52
longer, and you could use that
as a measure of what babies find


276
0:15:56,52 --> 0:15:57,605
different.
For instance,


277
0:15:57,605 --> 0:16:0,779
suppose you want to know if the
baby can tell green from red.


278
0:16:0,779 --> 0:16:3,438
Well, you could show the baby a
green patch, a green patch,


279
0:16:3,438 --> 0:16:4,86
a green patch,
a green patch;


280
0:16:4,86 --> 0:16:7,21
the baby'll get bored,
then a red patch.


281
0:16:7,21 --> 0:16:10,73
If they all look the same to
the baby, the baby will just


282
0:16:10,73 --> 0:16:13,935
continue to tune out,
but if the red looks different


283
0:16:13,935 --> 0:16:16,456
the baby will perk up.
And this is,


284
0:16:16,456 --> 0:16:20,3
in fact, one way they study
color vision in babies.


285
0:16:20,3 --> 0:16:25,105
Surprise is related to this.
You could show babies something


286
0:16:25,105 --> 0:16:28,802
that shouldn't happen.
If babies are like--If babies


287
0:16:28,802 --> 0:16:32,11
also think it shouldn't happen,
they might look longer,


288
0:16:32,11 --> 0:16:36,344
and essentially what happens is
scientists do magic tricks to


289
0:16:36,344 --> 0:16:39,85
explore this very thing.
And to start with some real


290
0:16:39,85 --> 0:16:43,5
examples, a lot of this infant
research has gone back to the


291
0:16:43,5 --> 0:16:46,159
Piagetian question of object
permanence,


292
0:16:46,159 --> 0:16:51,67
asking, "Is it really true
babies don't know that objects


293
0:16:51,67 --> 0:16:54,659
remain even when they're out of
sight?"


294
0:16:54,659 --> 0:16:59,118
So one very simple study by
Spelke and Baillargeon:


295
0:16:59,118 --> 0:17:4,557
Have babies shown a block with
a bar going back and forth like


296
0:17:4,557 --> 0:17:7,99
that.
So the bar just goes back and


297
0:17:7,99 --> 0:17:9,244
forth.
Now, there's something you do


298
0:17:9,244 --> 0:17:13,49
that's so obvious you probably
don't even know you're doing it.


299
0:17:13,49 --> 0:17:15,829
When you see a display like
that, what you assume is there's


300
0:17:15,829 --> 0:17:18,608
a bar there, and what that means
is there's something in the


301
0:17:18,608 --> 0:17:20,539
middle that you've never seen
before.


302
0:17:20,539 --> 0:17:23,39
But of course,
if you were a simple perceptual


303
0:17:23,39 --> 0:17:27,19
creature, you would just see
that there'd be a bar on top and


304
0:17:27,19 --> 0:17:29,654
a bar on the bottom.
You wouldn't expect anything in


305
0:17:29,654 --> 0:17:31,39
the middle because you never saw
anything in the middle.


306
0:17:31,39 --> 0:17:35,213
So, what you do then is you
show babies this and then you


307
0:17:35,213 --> 0:17:39,36
show them either B or C and if
we do this with adults you


308
0:17:39,36 --> 0:17:42,165
expect B, C is almost a joke.
And, in fact,


309
0:17:42,165 --> 0:17:46,49
babies respond the same way.
Babies expect there to be an


310
0:17:46,49 --> 0:17:50,185
entire, complete bar and are
surprised and look longer at the


311
0:17:50,185 --> 0:17:52,153
broken bar.
Other studies,


312
0:17:52,153 --> 0:17:55,52
some of them--Well,
here's another study by Rene


313
0:17:55,52 --> 0:17:59,819
Baillargeon looking at the same
thing in a different way.


314
0:17:59,819 --> 0:18:3,631
You show the baby,
say a six-month-old,


315
0:18:3,631 --> 0:18:8,273
a stage with a block on it.
Then a screen rises and


316
0:18:8,273 --> 0:18:12,261
obscures the block.
Now, if the babies expect the


317
0:18:12,261 --> 0:18:16,625
block to still be there,
they should think the block


318
0:18:16,625 --> 0:18:19,822
should stop the screen.
On the other hand,


319
0:18:19,822 --> 0:18:22,901
if out of sight out of mind,
they should expect the screen


320
0:18:22,901 --> 0:18:25,523
to keep going.
So, what you do is you set up a


321
0:18:25,523 --> 0:18:28,38
couple of displays,
one where the block is stopped,


322
0:18:28,38 --> 0:18:31,968
the other one where you take
this away with a trap door and


323
0:18:31,968 --> 0:18:34,235
it keeps going.
And, as you see,


324
0:18:34,235 --> 0:18:36,97
the baby screams when this
happens.


325
0:18:36,97 --> 0:18:41,23
That doesn't really happen,
but they do look longer.


326
0:18:41,23 --> 0:18:44,339
One final example of an object
permanence study.


327
0:18:44,339 --> 0:18:48,53
Some of this work's been done
at Yale in Karen Wynn's lab,


328
0:18:48,53 --> 0:18:51,637
where they look at babies'
understanding of addition and


329
0:18:51,637 --> 0:18:54,62
subtraction.
And a lot of it is done with


330
0:18:54,62 --> 0:18:55,937
real objects,
but there's also animated


331
0:18:55,937 --> 0:18:58,6
versions so here is an animated
example.


332
0:18:58,6 --> 0:19:21,61



333
0:19:21,61 --> 0:19:27,813
Babies are surprised.
They expect 2 - 1 = 1 and when


334
0:19:27,813 --> 0:19:31,394
2 - 1 = 2 or 3 or 0,
they look longer,


335
0:19:31,394 --> 0:19:35,39
indicating surprise.
And even six-month-olds are


336
0:19:35,39 --> 0:19:38,799
sensitive to these rudimentary
facts of arithmetic,


337
0:19:38,799 --> 0:19:41,377
telling us something about
their mathematical knowledge,


338
0:19:41,377 --> 0:19:44,236
but also telling us something
about that they expect things to


339
0:19:44,236 --> 0:19:45,97
remain when they're out of
sight.


340
0:19:45,97 --> 0:19:50,678
Now, this research suggests
that infants' understanding of


341
0:19:50,678 --> 0:19:54,56
the physical world is there from
the very start,


342
0:19:54,56 --> 0:19:57,7
but at the same time not
entirely.


343
0:19:57,7 --> 0:20:0,29
We know there are certain
things babies don't know.


344
0:20:0,29 --> 0:20:4,789
Here's an example.
Suppose you show babies this.


345
0:20:4,789 --> 0:20:7,936
You have a block here and then
you have something above there


346
0:20:7,936 --> 0:20:11,829
floating in mid air.
Babies find this surprising.


347
0:20:11,829 --> 0:20:14,69
Even six-month-olds find this
surprising.


348
0:20:14,69 --> 0:20:18,289
It violates gravity,
but six-month-olds aren't smart


349
0:20:18,289 --> 0:20:22,839
enough to know that a block just
stuck over here is also


350
0:20:22,839 --> 0:20:25,474
surprising.
Twelve-month-olds will think


351
0:20:25,474 --> 0:20:27,884
that it should fall.
Six-month-olds don't,


352
0:20:27,884 --> 0:20:31,849
and even 12-month-olds don't
find anything weird about this,


353
0:20:31,849 --> 0:20:36,329
while adults are sophisticated
enough to understand that that's


354
0:20:36,329 --> 0:20:39,869
an unstable configuration and
should fall over.


355
0:20:39,869 --> 0:20:44,589
So, although some things are
built in, some things develop.


356
0:20:44,589 --> 0:20:47,482
And this raises the question
of, "How do we explain


357
0:20:47,482 --> 0:20:50,373
development?"
How do we explain when babies


358
0:20:50,373 --> 0:20:54,14
come to know things that they
didn't originally know?


359
0:20:54,14 --> 0:21:0,839
Well, one answer is neural
maturation, growth of the brain.


360
0:21:0,839 --> 0:21:4,517
Most of the neurons you have
now in your head,


361
0:21:4,517 --> 0:21:9,339
right now, you had when you
were in your mother's uterus.


362
0:21:9,339 --> 0:21:12,143
What happens in development
isn't for the most part the


363
0:21:12,143 --> 0:21:15,289
growth of new neurons.
It's for the most part pruning,


364
0:21:15,289 --> 0:21:18,32
getting rid of neurons.
So, the neural structures


365
0:21:18,32 --> 0:21:22,4
change radically as babies kind
of get rid of excess neurons


366
0:21:22,4 --> 0:21:25,238
through development.
At the same time though,


367
0:21:25,238 --> 0:21:29,435
connections between neurons
grow like crazy and they--and


368
0:21:29,435 --> 0:21:34,82
this process of synaptic growth
where there are the connections


369
0:21:34,82 --> 0:21:38,279
across different synapses peaks
at about two years.


370
0:21:38,279 --> 0:21:41,276
Finally, remember myelination,
where you sort of get this


371
0:21:41,276 --> 0:21:44,38
fatty sheath over your neuron to
make it more effective?


372
0:21:44,38 --> 0:21:47,694
That also happens through
development, and in fact,


373
0:21:47,694 --> 0:21:51,605
it goes through development and
even teenagers are not fully


374
0:21:51,605 --> 0:21:53,373
myelinated.
In particular,


375
0:21:53,373 --> 0:21:56,299
they're not fully myelinated in
their frontal lobes.


376
0:21:56,299 --> 0:22:0,793
Recall that frontal lobes are
involved in things like


377
0:22:0,793 --> 0:22:4,921
restraint and willpower.
And so, it could be the problem


378
0:22:4,921 --> 0:22:7,41
is the baby's brain doesn't
develop yet.


379
0:22:7,41 --> 0:22:12,349
Another possibility is there's
problems with inhibition.


380
0:22:12,349 --> 0:22:15,372
This is related,
again, to the frontal lobes and


381
0:22:15,372 --> 0:22:18,9
this comes out with the A,
not B error.


382
0:22:18,9 --> 0:22:22,69
So, remember the baby reaches,
reaches, reaches.


383
0:22:22,69 --> 0:22:27,34
It's moved, reach,
follow, keeps reaching the same


384
0:22:27,34 --> 0:22:29,232
place.
And it could be that babies


385
0:22:29,232 --> 0:22:30,7
don't know anything about
objects.


386
0:22:30,7 --> 0:22:33,948
But another possibility is once
you do something it's kind of


387
0:22:33,948 --> 0:22:36,472
hard to stop.
It takes a bit of control to


388
0:22:36,472 --> 0:22:38,71
stop.
And there's all sorts of


389
0:22:38,71 --> 0:22:40,74
independent evidence that babies
lack this control.


390
0:22:40,74 --> 0:22:45,839
The part of their brain that
could control certain behaviors


391
0:22:45,839 --> 0:22:49,136
is just not active yet.
There's a very nice


392
0:22:49,136 --> 0:22:52,247
illustration of inhibitory
problems from a "Simpsons"


393
0:22:52,247 --> 0:22:55,777
episode that actually sort of
covers anything you might want


394
0:22:55,777 --> 0:22:58,47
to know about developmental
differences.


395
0:22:58,47 --> 0:23:1,74



396
0:23:1,74 --> 0:23:4,33
And that basically may sum up
much of developmental


397
0:23:4,33 --> 0:23:8,25
psychology.
That the child essentially--he


398
0:23:8,25 --> 0:23:10,77
does A, A, A.
It's moved.


399
0:23:10,77 --> 0:23:13,569
You go, "doh!"
and he keeps going for it.


400
0:23:13,569 --> 0:23:15,7
And there's some evidence
that's true.


401
0:23:15,7 --> 0:23:19,871
Adele Diamond who studies this
finds that although kids reach


402
0:23:19,871 --> 0:23:23,63
for A, they look for B,
as if they know it's there but


403
0:23:23,63 --> 0:23:26,46
they can't stop themselves from
reaching.


404
0:23:26,46 --> 0:23:28,799
And we'll continue this theme a
little bit later.


405
0:23:28,799 --> 0:23:32,73
Finally, it might be kids don't
know things.


406
0:23:32,73 --> 0:23:36,7
Some things you've got to learn.
And this is true in all sorts


407
0:23:36,7 --> 0:23:40,73
of domains – in the social
world, in the economic world,


408
0:23:40,73 --> 0:23:43,57
in the political world – and
it's true as well in the


409
0:23:43,57 --> 0:23:45,712
physical world.
In fact, there's some things


410
0:23:45,712 --> 0:23:49,366
even adults don't know.
So, here's a study by Michael


411
0:23:49,366 --> 0:23:54,18
McCloskey with college students.
Here's the idea.


412
0:23:54,18 --> 0:23:58,342
You have a tube,
a transparent--a tube--a hollow


413
0:23:58,342 --> 0:24:3,833
tube, and at the top of the tube
you throw a ball through so it


414
0:24:3,833 --> 0:24:7,73
whips through the tube and it
comes out.


415
0:24:7,73 --> 0:24:9,809
The question is,
"What happens to it?"


416
0:24:9,809 --> 0:24:15,509
Does it go in the path of A,
or does it go in the path of B?


417
0:24:15,509 --> 0:24:18,81
Without looking around,
who votes for A?


418
0:24:18,81 --> 0:24:22,869
Who votes for B?
Here's the weird thing.


419
0:24:22,869 --> 0:24:26,608
Whenever I do this at Yale
everybody gets the damn thing


420
0:24:26,608 --> 0:24:29,808
right [laughter].
At Johns Hopkins,


421
0:24:29,808 --> 0:24:33,29
50/50, [laughter]
for A and B.


422
0:24:33,29 --> 0:24:37,741
I got to get a better demo.
But anyway, college students


423
0:24:37,741 --> 0:24:42,929
not here, show systematic biases
of incorrect physical


424
0:24:42,929 --> 0:24:45,391
intuitions.
Here's a twist,


425
0:24:45,391 --> 0:24:49,394
and if you found people who
were less wonderful than you


426
0:24:49,394 --> 0:24:53,979
all, and asked them you'd get a
lot of people saying the curving


427
0:24:53,979 --> 0:24:55,789
thing.
But here's a twist.


428
0:24:55,789 --> 0:24:58,491
Ask somebody,
"What if you took a tube and


429
0:24:58,491 --> 0:25:2,4
you squirted water through it?
Where would the water go?"


430
0:25:2,4 --> 0:25:5,698
Nobody chooses B.
Everybody knows the water would


431
0:25:5,698 --> 0:25:8,783
continue in a straight line,
suggesting that when you have


432
0:25:8,783 --> 0:25:12,25
experience that helps you out,
but in absence of experience


433
0:25:12,25 --> 0:25:16,3
you're kind of lost.
We've talked about the physical


434
0:25:16,3 --> 0:25:18,13
world.
What about the social world?


435
0:25:18,13 --> 0:25:21,614
What about the world of people?
Well, there's a lot of research


436
0:25:21,614 --> 0:25:24,184
on this as well.
Babies start off with some


437
0:25:24,184 --> 0:25:26,634
social preferences.
If you take newborn


438
0:25:26,634 --> 0:25:30,35
babies--It's very hard to do
research with newborn babies


439
0:25:30,35 --> 0:25:33,68
actually because of the consent
procedure and everything,


440
0:25:33,68 --> 0:25:37,271
so most of this work is done in
France [laughter],


441
0:25:37,271 --> 0:25:40,697
where they have no laws at all.
They just rush in to--Women


442
0:25:40,697 --> 0:25:42,488
give birth and they rush in and
they say, "We are


443
0:25:42,488 --> 0:25:44,885
psychologists,"
and then we do experiments on


444
0:25:44,885 --> 0:25:49,577
the babies, and it's terrific.
And this is one of them where


445
0:25:49,577 --> 0:25:54,39
they compare babies looking at
this versus this.


446
0:25:54,39 --> 0:25:57,3
Babies like the one that looks
like a face.


447
0:25:57,3 --> 0:26:1,0
These are newborns.
There are some preferences with


448
0:26:1,0 --> 0:26:4,79
humans and with other primates
to favor faces.


449
0:26:4,79 --> 0:26:8,45
Babies are also social animals
too, so they're natural mimics.


450
0:26:8,45 --> 0:26:10,372
Andrew Meltzoff,
for instance,


451
0:26:10,372 --> 0:26:13,155
has found that if you go to a
newborn baby,


452
0:26:13,155 --> 0:26:16,999
and if you find a newborn baby,
this is the first thing you


453
0:26:16,999 --> 0:26:19,979
should do.
Stick your face right up to the


454
0:26:19,979 --> 0:26:23,509
newborn baby and go like this
and stick your tongue out.


455
0:26:23,509 --> 0:26:28,443
And Meltzoff finds that babies
more often than not stick their


456
0:26:28,443 --> 0:26:31,714
tongues out back,
suggesting some sort of social


457
0:26:31,714 --> 0:26:34,895
connection from one person to
another, and then later on


458
0:26:34,895 --> 0:26:38,406
babies are mimics.
Babies more often than not will


459
0:26:38,406 --> 0:26:42,895
copy the face next to them.
Now, these--the nature of these


460
0:26:42,895 --> 0:26:47,259
responses, this preferring
faces, this sort of mimicry,


461
0:26:47,259 --> 0:26:49,917
is a matter of debate,
and there's a lot of research


462
0:26:49,917 --> 0:26:51,95
going on asking how smart are
babies.


463
0:26:51,95 --> 0:26:55,813
Can we see--use some of the
same methods that we've looked


464
0:26:55,813 --> 0:26:59,609
at for the physical world to
look at the social world?


465
0:26:59,609 --> 0:27:2,984
And to illustrate one of the
studies, I'll tell you about a


466
0:27:2,984 --> 0:27:6,299
study that I did with Valerie
Kuhlmeier and Karen Wynn.


467
0:27:6,299 --> 0:27:8,819
And so, what we tested was
nine-month-olds and


468
0:27:8,819 --> 0:27:11,45
twelve-month-olds,
and we showed them movies.


469
0:27:11,45 --> 0:27:14,144
So, they're sitting down and
they're seeing a movie where one


470
0:27:14,144 --> 0:27:16,39
character's going to help a ball
achieve a goal,


471
0:27:16,39 --> 0:27:18,4
and another character's going
to hinder the ball.


472
0:27:18,4 --> 0:27:22,184
And then we're going to see
whether they expect the ball to


473
0:27:22,184 --> 0:27:26,49
approach the one that helped it
versus the one that hindered it.


474
0:27:26,49 --> 0:27:30,69
So, this is what a baby would
see.


475
0:27:30,69 --> 0:27:32,9
This is literally the same
movie a baby would see in the


476
0:27:32,9 --> 0:27:35,194
experiment.
The thing is for these sorts of


477
0:27:35,194 --> 0:27:38,287
experiments there is a lot of
control, so something that's a


478
0:27:38,287 --> 0:27:41,38
square in one movie will be a
triangle in another movie;


479
0:27:41,38 --> 0:27:44,407
something that's on the top in
one movie will be on the bottom


480
0:27:44,407 --> 0:27:46,532
in another movie.
So, this is an example movie


481
0:27:46,532 --> 0:27:48,1
but this is what babies would
see.


482
0:27:48,1 --> 0:28:4,15



483
0:28:4,15 --> 0:28:8,1
And they'd see this over and
over again and the question is


484
0:28:8,1 --> 0:28:11,671
would they expect babies--would
babies expect the one to


485
0:28:11,671 --> 0:28:15,331
approach the one that helped it
or approach the one that


486
0:28:15,331 --> 0:28:17,616
hindered it?
And what we find is,


487
0:28:17,616 --> 0:28:20,61
statistically,
babies look longer when shown a


488
0:28:20,61 --> 0:28:23,104
movie where it approaches the
one that hindered it versus


489
0:28:23,104 --> 0:28:26,775
helped it.
And this we take as preliminary


490
0:28:26,775 --> 0:28:31,289
evidence that they have a social
interpretation.


491
0:28:31,289 --> 0:28:34,95
They see this movie as you see
this movie in terms of helping


492
0:28:34,95 --> 0:28:36,153
and hindering,
and somebody going to somebody


493
0:28:36,153 --> 0:28:37,93
that helped it versus hindered
it.


494
0:28:37,93 --> 0:28:41,799
You could then ask--This makes
a prediction that babies should


495
0:28:41,799 --> 0:28:45,415
themselves prefer the creature
who's the helper versus the


496
0:28:45,415 --> 0:28:47,408
hinderer,
and to explore this,


497
0:28:47,408 --> 0:28:50,387
a graduate student in this
department, Kiley Hamlin,


498
0:28:50,387 --> 0:28:53,483
has started a series of studies
where they show babies


499
0:28:53,483 --> 0:28:56,813
three-dimensional scenes and
then give them the characters


500
0:28:56,813 --> 0:28:59,15
and see which one they reach
for.


501
0:28:59,15 --> 0:29:1,81
So, here's video so you could
see how this experiment is done.


502
0:29:1,81 --> 0:30:1,849



503
0:30:1,849 --> 0:30:4,79
Now, the next trial is from a
different study.


504
0:30:4,79 --> 0:30:8,269
A different thing we use,
and the baby is given a choice.


505
0:30:8,269 --> 0:30:11,495
One thing to know
methodologically is the person


506
0:30:11,495 --> 0:30:14,24
giving a choice is blind to the
study.


507
0:30:14,24 --> 0:30:17,682
And blind here is a technical
term meaning she had no idea


508
0:30:17,682 --> 0:30:20,637
what the baby saw,
and the point about this is to


509
0:30:20,637 --> 0:30:24,16
avoid either intentional or
unintentional sort of trying to


510
0:30:24,16 --> 0:30:26,882
get the answer you want.
She couldn't do that because


511
0:30:26,882 --> 0:30:28,819
she didn't know what the right
answer is.


512
0:30:28,819 --> 0:30:29,41
So, here's what the baby would
see.


513
0:30:29,41 --> 0:30:40,569



514
0:30:40,569 --> 0:30:47,524
So, this suggests that some
social understanding may be


515
0:30:47,524 --> 0:30:52,939
there from the very start.
This evidence is tentative,


516
0:30:52,939 --> 0:30:57,16
very controversial.
But now, I want to raise a huge


517
0:30:57,16 --> 0:31:2,313
developmental puzzle and the
puzzle is there are some ways in


518
0:31:2,313 --> 0:31:5,579
which babies are--not just
babies,


519
0:31:5,579 --> 0:31:10,336
but young children are very
clueless when it comes to


520
0:31:10,336 --> 0:31:13,178
people.
And so, I have a film clip here


521
0:31:13,178 --> 0:31:16,824
of two very nice studies showing
babies' ignorant--sorry,


522
0:31:16,824 --> 0:31:19,819
young children's ignorance of
other people.


523
0:31:19,819 --> 0:31:26,161
I'll show you the studies and
then we'll briefly discuss what


524
0:31:26,161 --> 0:31:28,944
they mean.
Professor Paul Bloom:


525
0:31:28,944 --> 0:31:32,8
Before discussing that example
in a little bit more detail,


526
0:31:32,8 --> 0:31:33,91
any questions?
What are your questions?


527
0:31:33,91 --> 0:31:36,551
Yes, in back.
Student: [inaudible]


528
0:31:36,551 --> 0:31:39,346
Professor Paul Bloom:
Typically--I don't know for


529
0:31:39,346 --> 0:31:42,86
those particular children,
but typically on those tasks


530
0:31:42,86 --> 0:31:46,869
three-year-olds and young
four-year-olds tend to fail,


531
0:31:46,869 --> 0:31:50,49
and around the age of four or
five kids tend to succeed.


532
0:31:50,49 --> 0:31:53,465
There's sort of a period around
the age of four,


533
0:31:53,465 --> 0:31:56,377
four and a half,
where kids make the transition


534
0:31:56,377 --> 0:31:58,765
from failure to success.
The question,


535
0:31:58,765 --> 0:32:1,178
by the way, was when do
children--in that video when


536
0:32:1,178 --> 0:32:4,112
were the--what were the ages of
the children who failed and who


537
0:32:4,112 --> 0:32:4,68
passed?


538
0:32:4,68 --> 0:32:7,72



539
0:32:7,72 --> 0:32:13,855
Yes.
Student: [inaudible]


540
0:32:13,855 --> 0:32:19,231
Professor Paul Bloom:
The question of whether


541
0:32:19,231 --> 0:32:25,66
discriminant conditioning has
been used with babies to explore


542
0:32:25,66 --> 0:32:31,18
what sort of concepts they have.
I don't know.


543
0:32:31,18 --> 0:32:34,41
Does anybody--It has been--
Graduate Student:


544
0:32:34,41 --> 0:32:37,14
--It's not as effective--
Professor Paul Bloom:


545
0:32:37,14 --> 0:32:40,324
Koleen answered and said that
it's not as effective as other


546
0:32:40,324 --> 0:32:42,945
methods.
Part of the problem with using


547
0:32:42,945 --> 0:32:46,861
operant conditioning with babies
is it's difficult to get them to


548
0:32:46,861 --> 0:32:51,889
behave in any systematic way.
So, the looking-time measures


549
0:32:51,889 --> 0:32:56,1
tend to be more subtle.
Any other questions?


550
0:32:56,1 --> 0:33:1,17



551
0:33:1,17 --> 0:33:3,7
Oh.
Yes.


552
0:33:3,7 --> 0:33:9,786
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:


553
0:33:9,786 --> 0:33:11,644
Oh.
The question of why they


554
0:33:11,644 --> 0:33:14,958
chose--the baby--the kids chose
the rocket ship one as opposed


555
0:33:14,958 --> 0:33:17,455
to the Rafael one.
It wasn't what they were


556
0:33:17,455 --> 0:33:20,974
interested in in the experiment.
And my bet is when they chose


557
0:33:20,974 --> 0:33:23,714
the stickers they had a pretty
good sense of why,


558
0:33:23,714 --> 0:33:26,91
of which ones the boys would
prefer in those studies.


559
0:33:26,91 --> 0:33:30,593
The question of why a boy might
prefer one sort of sticker,


560
0:33:30,593 --> 0:33:33,96
and you might get a different
response with a girl,


561
0:33:33,96 --> 0:33:36,935
is going to come up later when
we discuss different theories of


562
0:33:36,935 --> 0:33:38,822
sex differences.
But that was something I think


563
0:33:38,822 --> 0:33:40,97
they were just assuming in the
study to get it off the ground.


564
0:33:40,97 --> 0:33:47,74



565
0:33:47,74 --> 0:33:48,82
Okay.


566
0:33:48,82 --> 0:33:54,15



567
0:33:54,15 --> 0:33:58,23
There's a huge debate over
what's going on there.


568
0:33:58,23 --> 0:34:2,13
And if you listened at the end
to the psychologist summarizing


569
0:34:2,13 --> 0:34:5,735
the data, the psychologist had a
very good and very clear and


570
0:34:5,735 --> 0:34:8,3
strong idea of what was going
on.


571
0:34:8,3 --> 0:34:11,23
It was that children need to
know more about minds.


572
0:34:11,23 --> 0:34:15,886
The children don't know about
that you can do something with


573
0:34:15,886 --> 0:34:19,816
the intent to deceive.
They don't understand that


574
0:34:19,816 --> 0:34:24,28
somebody could choose what you
chose in a malicious way.


575
0:34:24,28 --> 0:34:29,935
This is possible.
This is one respectable theory,


576
0:34:29,935 --> 0:34:34,154
but the alternative is they
have the right knowledge,


577
0:34:34,154 --> 0:34:38,13
but they suffer from problems
with inhibition.


578
0:34:38,13 --> 0:34:40,679
So, consider both studies.
The first study,


579
0:34:40,679 --> 0:34:43,682
the one with the deceptive
dolls with the big shoes and


580
0:34:43,682 --> 0:34:46,239
little shoes,
is actually fairly difficult.


581
0:34:46,239 --> 0:34:50,445
And it's possible that children
kind of got overwhelmed with it,


582
0:34:50,445 --> 0:34:53,449
and when asked what would the
mother think,


583
0:34:53,449 --> 0:34:56,29
who the mother would think
stole the food,


584
0:34:56,29 --> 0:34:59,269
responded with who really stole
the food.


585
0:34:59,269 --> 0:35:2,371
And that there's some pull
towards the right answer that


586
0:35:2,371 --> 0:35:6,47
makes this task difficult.
The second one--the second


587
0:35:6,47 --> 0:35:9,92
study illustrates this issue
even more clearly.


588
0:35:9,92 --> 0:35:14,53
Take the boy who kept failing.
He kept pointing to the rocket


589
0:35:14,53 --> 0:35:16,969
ship and mean monkey kept taking
it away.


590
0:35:16,969 --> 0:35:20,839
It's possible that he genuinely
didn't know what to do,


591
0:35:20,839 --> 0:35:24,995
that he wasn't smart enough to
understand that he needed to


592
0:35:24,995 --> 0:35:28,82
point to the other one.
But it's also possible that


593
0:35:28,82 --> 0:35:32,46
it's a Homer Simpson-like
effect, where when asked to


594
0:35:32,46 --> 0:35:36,233
point to what he wants,
he just couldn't help but point


595
0:35:36,233 --> 0:35:40,2
to the one he wanted.
And that the extra work it


596
0:35:40,2 --> 0:35:45,151
takes to lie was beyond him.
And, in support of the second


597
0:35:45,151 --> 0:35:50,304
alternative, even adults find
these tasks involving lying and


598
0:35:50,304 --> 0:35:53,96
deception more difficult.
They were slower at them.


599
0:35:53,96 --> 0:35:58,992
We make more mistakes than
tasks that don't involve lying


600
0:35:58,992 --> 0:36:1,914
and deception.
So, I'm raising this not to


601
0:36:1,914 --> 0:36:4,799
solve the problem.
You'll read more about it in


602
0:36:4,799 --> 0:36:8,806
the Peter Gray textbook and more
about it in The Norton


603
0:36:8,806 --> 0:36:12,885
readings on development,
but just to raise this as an


604
0:36:12,885 --> 0:36:17,614
interesting area of debate.
Another interesting area of


605
0:36:17,614 --> 0:36:22,284
debate is, "What's the
relationship between different


606
0:36:22,284 --> 0:36:27,525
sorts of development?"
So, I started off with Piaget,


607
0:36:27,525 --> 0:36:31,818
and Piaget, like Freud,
believed in general,


608
0:36:31,818 --> 0:36:36,809
across the board changes in how
children think.


609
0:36:36,809 --> 0:36:39,841
An alternative,
though, is that there's


610
0:36:39,841 --> 0:36:43,75
separate modules,
and this is a view developed,


611
0:36:43,75 --> 0:36:47,331
again, by Noam Chomsky,
and also by the philosopher of


612
0:36:47,331 --> 0:36:50,575
mind Jerry Fodor,
who claimed that the whole idea


613
0:36:50,575 --> 0:36:54,36
of a child developing as a
single story is mistaken.


614
0:36:54,36 --> 0:36:58,866
What you get instead is there
are separate pre-wired systems


615
0:36:58,866 --> 0:37:2,981
for reasoning about the world.
These systems have some


616
0:37:2,981 --> 0:37:6,107
built-in knowledge,
and they have to do some


617
0:37:6,107 --> 0:37:9,268
learning,
but the learning pattern varies


618
0:37:9,268 --> 0:37:13,55
from system to system and
there's a separateness to them.


619
0:37:13,55 --> 0:37:15,829
Why should we take this view
seriously?


620
0:37:15,829 --> 0:37:20,77
Well, one reason is that there
are developmental disorders that


621
0:37:20,77 --> 0:37:24,5
seem to involve damage to one
system but not to another.


622
0:37:24,5 --> 0:37:27,65
And the classic case of this is
a disorder known as autism.


623
0:37:27,65 --> 0:37:31,285
And autism is something I've
always found a fascinating


624
0:37:31,285 --> 0:37:34,644
disorder for many reasons.
It's actually why I entered


625
0:37:34,644 --> 0:37:37,98
psychology.
I started off working with


626
0:37:37,98 --> 0:37:40,522
children with autism.
And it could be taken as a


627
0:37:40,522 --> 0:37:44,913
striking illustration of how the
social part of your brain is


628
0:37:44,913 --> 0:37:48,59
distinct from other parts of
your brain.


629
0:37:48,59 --> 0:37:51,9
So, what autism is is a
disorder that strikes about one


630
0:37:51,9 --> 0:37:54,46
in a thousand people,
mostly boys.


631
0:37:54,46 --> 0:37:59,439
And the dominant problems
concern--consist of a lack of


632
0:37:59,439 --> 0:38:2,944
social connectedness,
problems with language,


633
0:38:2,944 --> 0:38:5,833
problems dealing with people,
and more generally,


634
0:38:5,833 --> 0:38:8,119
a problem of what the
psychologist,


635
0:38:8,119 --> 0:38:12,1
Simon Baron-Cohen has described
as "mind blindness."


636
0:38:12,1 --> 0:38:15,146
In that autistic people show no
impairments dealing with the


637
0:38:15,146 --> 0:38:17,626
physical world,
they show no impairments


638
0:38:17,626 --> 0:38:21,7
on--they don't necessarily show
any impairments on mathematical


639
0:38:21,7 --> 0:38:25,477
skills or spatial skills,
but they have a lot of problems


640
0:38:25,477 --> 0:38:28,791
with people.
Now, many autistic children


641
0:38:28,791 --> 0:38:31,963
have no language;
they're totally shut off from


642
0:38:31,963 --> 0:38:33,727
society.
But even some of them who'd


643
0:38:33,727 --> 0:38:36,755
learned language and who managed
to get some sort of independent


644
0:38:36,755 --> 0:38:39,489
life,
nevertheless will suffer from a


645
0:38:39,489 --> 0:38:42,84
severe social impairment.
And this could be shown in all


646
0:38:42,84 --> 0:38:45,617
sorts of ways.
A simple experiment developed


647
0:38:45,617 --> 0:38:48,28
by Simon Baron-Cohen goes like
this.


648
0:38:48,28 --> 0:38:50,44
You show this to three- and
four-year-olds.


649
0:38:50,44 --> 0:38:52,882
There's four candies there,
and you say,


650
0:38:52,882 --> 0:38:56,654
"This is Charlie in the middle.
Which chocolate will Charlie


651
0:38:56,654 --> 0:38:59,128
take?"
For most children and most of


652
0:38:59,128 --> 0:39:2,659
you, I hope, the answer's pretty
clear: This one.


653
0:39:2,659 --> 0:39:5,685
Autistic children will often
just shrug, say,


654
0:39:5,685 --> 0:39:8,268
"How could I know?"
because they don't


655
0:39:8,268 --> 0:39:11,998
instinctively appreciate that
people's interests and desires


656
0:39:11,998 --> 0:39:14,969
tend to be attuned to where
they're looking.


657
0:39:14,969 --> 0:39:18,43
Another sort of task,
which is a task that's been


658
0:39:18,43 --> 0:39:20,668
done hundreds,
perhaps thousands of times,


659
0:39:20,668 --> 0:39:24,51
is known as "the false-belief
task" and here's the idea.


660
0:39:24,51 --> 0:39:28,73
You show the child the
following situation.


661
0:39:28,73 --> 0:39:34,54
There's a doll named Maxie and
Maxie puts the ball in the


662
0:39:34,54 --> 0:39:38,171
cupboard.
Maxie leaves and a second doll


663
0:39:38,171 --> 0:39:41,471
enters.
The second doll takes the ball


664
0:39:41,471 --> 0:39:45,36
out of the cupboard and puts it
under the bed.


665
0:39:45,36 --> 0:39:49,557
Maxie comes back and the
question is, "Where will Maxie


666
0:39:49,557 --> 0:39:53,429
look for the ball?"
Now, this is a question about


667
0:39:53,429 --> 0:39:58,0
your understanding about minds.
The question of where is the


668
0:39:58,0 --> 0:40:1,9
ball really is a question about
the physical world.


669
0:40:1,9 --> 0:40:5,619
Everyone can solve it,
but this question is hard.


670
0:40:5,619 --> 0:40:9,888
The right answer is Max
will--Maxie will look in the


671
0:40:9,888 --> 0:40:15,77
cupboard, even though it's not
really there because Maxie has a


672
0:40:15,77 --> 0:40:19,409
false belief about the world.
Three-year-olds find this


673
0:40:19,409 --> 0:40:21,371
difficult.
Two-year-olds find this


674
0:40:21,371 --> 0:40:23,45
difficult.
Four-year-olds and


675
0:40:23,45 --> 0:40:25,59
five-year-olds are able to pass
this task.


676
0:40:25,59 --> 0:40:28,1
Normal adults are able to pass
this task.


677
0:40:28,1 --> 0:40:30,739
Children with autism have
serious problems.


678
0:40:30,739 --> 0:40:34,6
And often, people with autism
who are otherwise very high


679
0:40:34,6 --> 0:40:36,514
functioning will fail this task.
They'll say,


680
0:40:36,514 --> 0:40:38,873
"Oh, he must think it's
not--He'll--He's going to check


681
0:40:38,873 --> 0:40:43,69
under the bed."
Any questions about autism?


682
0:40:43,69 --> 0:40:47,97



683
0:40:47,97 --> 0:40:52,423
Yes.
Student: [inaudible]


684
0:40:52,423 --> 0:40:57,14
Professor Paul Bloom:
Good question.


685
0:40:57,14 --> 0:41:0,119
It isn't.
They're both experiments


686
0:41:0,119 --> 0:41:3,55
designed to tap an appreciation
of false belief.


687
0:41:3,55 --> 0:41:7,196
The deception one with the
shoes and everything looked at


688
0:41:7,196 --> 0:41:10,864
it in the course of deception.
Can you understand that the


689
0:41:10,864 --> 0:41:14,269
mother might think it's that
person even though it's really


690
0:41:14,269 --> 0:41:16,489
that person?
And our kid failed.


691
0:41:16,489 --> 0:41:22,175
This is a sort of stripped-down
version without all the


692
0:41:22,175 --> 0:41:27,23
fanciness but it tests exactly
the same thing.


693
0:41:27,23 --> 0:41:30,666
Yes.
Student: [inaudible]


694
0:41:30,666 --> 0:41:33,136
Professor Paul Bloom:
Nobody knows,


695
0:41:33,136 --> 0:41:36,51
but there's a theory which
won't answer your question but


696
0:41:36,51 --> 0:41:38,92
will put it into a broader
context.


697
0:41:38,92 --> 0:41:42,785
Simon Baron-Cohen argues that
there are certain abilities that


698
0:41:42,785 --> 0:41:45,32
tend to be more sequestered for
males,


699
0:41:45,32 --> 0:41:48,89
and other abilities that are
more sequestered,


700
0:41:48,89 --> 0:41:51,6
more focused on females.
Social abilities,


701
0:41:51,6 --> 0:41:54,69
he argues, tend to be more
female than male.


702
0:41:54,69 --> 0:41:57,543
So, the way Baron puts it,
provocatively,


703
0:41:57,543 --> 0:42:1,68
is to be a man is to suffer
from a very mild form of autism


704
0:42:1,68 --> 0:42:4,853
[laughter].
The idea is then that autistic


705
0:42:4,853 --> 0:42:8,989
individuals suffer from what he
calls extreme male brains,


706
0:42:8,989 --> 0:42:11,459
and as such,
it stands to reason that they'd


707
0:42:11,459 --> 0:42:14,618
be more sampled from the male
population than the female


708
0:42:14,618 --> 0:42:16,922
population.
That's such an interesting


709
0:42:16,922 --> 0:42:19,474
issue, that again,
when we return to talk about


710
0:42:19,474 --> 0:42:22,858
sex differences we'll look at
that in a little bit more detail


711
0:42:22,858 --> 0:42:25,41
to see if it's supported by the
evidence.


712
0:42:25,41 --> 0:42:30,552
Yes.
Student: [inaudible]


713
0:42:30,552 --> 0:42:36,17
Professor Paul Bloom:
I'm sorry.


714
0:42:36,17 --> 0:42:41,328
Tell me the--Is the severity of
autism… Student:


715
0:42:41,328 --> 0:42:44,92
[inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:


716
0:42:44,92 --> 0:42:49,62
It's an interesting question.
The question is,


717
0:42:49,62 --> 0:42:52,99
"How do you think about the
severity of autism with regard


718
0:42:52,99 --> 0:42:57,69
to developmental stages?"
And sort of surprisingly,


719
0:42:57,69 --> 0:43:1,11
autism can't really be thought
of in that way.


720
0:43:1,11 --> 0:43:4,678
So, it's not like an adult with
autism is like a three-year-old


721
0:43:4,678 --> 0:43:6,688
or a two-year-old.
In some ways,


722
0:43:6,688 --> 0:43:9,858
somebody with autism isn't like
any child at all,


723
0:43:9,858 --> 0:43:12,5
any normally developing child
at all.


724
0:43:12,5 --> 0:43:16,462
So, it's not really a
developmental delay in the way


725
0:43:16,462 --> 0:43:20,736
that it might make sense to
think about certain forms of


726
0:43:20,736 --> 0:43:22,897
retardation.
On the other hand,


727
0:43:22,897 --> 0:43:25,954
when we think about how severe
autism is we do look at things


728
0:43:25,954 --> 0:43:28,349
like how much language does the
person have,


729
0:43:28,349 --> 0:43:32,75
and in that sense,
it is related to development.


730
0:43:32,75 --> 0:43:34,789
Yes.
Student:


731
0:43:34,789 --> 0:43:37,772
What are the chances that
someone who's autistic would be


732
0:43:37,772 --> 0:43:39,849
able to overcome their
deficiencies?


733
0:43:39,849 --> 0:43:42,11
Professor Paul Bloom:
The majority of people with


734
0:43:42,11 --> 0:43:43,309
autism.
It's a good question.


735
0:43:43,309 --> 0:43:45,642
The question is,
"What are the chances that


736
0:43:45,642 --> 0:43:48,42
somebody with autism will be
able to overcome their


737
0:43:48,42 --> 0:43:50,947
deficiencies?"
Autism is a funny disorder in


738
0:43:50,947 --> 0:43:53,476
that there's a lot of media
publication and media


739
0:43:53,476 --> 0:43:55,665
presentation.
Often the people who are


740
0:43:55,665 --> 0:43:58,579
showcased in the media tend to
be very exceptional.


741
0:43:58,579 --> 0:44:0,597
So, there's a woman,
Temple Grandin,


742
0:44:0,597 --> 0:44:4,23
who's autistic and--Has anybody
here heard of Temple Grandin?


743
0:44:4,23 --> 0:44:7,475
She wrote some wonderful books
about her experience as an


744
0:44:7,475 --> 0:44:9,909
autistic person,
but she's very unusual.


745
0:44:9,909 --> 0:44:12,522
So a lot depends,
to answer your question,


746
0:44:12,522 --> 0:44:15,518
how one defines autism,
and whether one includes


747
0:44:15,518 --> 0:44:18,531
Asperger syndrome,
which is a limited,


748
0:44:18,531 --> 0:44:22,179
a more mild syndrome,
as a form of autism.


749
0:44:22,179 --> 0:44:25,587
The answer is that the majority
of people with autism have


750
0:44:25,587 --> 0:44:27,5
severe problems,
and will not,


751
0:44:27,5 --> 0:44:30,469
and at this stage,
with this level of therapy,


752
0:44:30,469 --> 0:44:33,664
will not lead a normal life.
Student:


753
0:44:33,664 --> 0:44:36,499
More specifically,
what I meant was,


754
0:44:36,499 --> 0:44:41,358
when you showed the example of
Rain Man, ere they exceptional


755
0:44:41,358 --> 0:44:44,517
[inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:


756
0:44:44,517 --> 0:44:48,189
Right.
The question is about so-called


757
0:44:48,189 --> 0:44:50,395
autistic savants.
So, Rain Man,


758
0:44:50,395 --> 0:44:53,348
the character played by Dustin
Hoffman, had extraordinary


759
0:44:53,348 --> 0:44:56,851
mathematical abilities.
And some people with autism


760
0:44:56,851 --> 0:45:0,958
have extraordinary artistic
abilities or mathematical


761
0:45:0,958 --> 0:45:5,38
abilities or musical abilities
and these are amazing.


762
0:45:5,38 --> 0:45:9,455
It's an amazing question why
they have it but this is a very


763
0:45:9,455 --> 0:45:11,706
small minority.
This is a very--It's


764
0:45:11,706 --> 0:45:15,42
fascinating that it happens at
all, that you have severe damage


765
0:45:15,42 --> 0:45:17,409
but compensated with some
powerful skill.


766
0:45:17,409 --> 0:45:20,59
Now, I know I'm answering your
question I think in a better


767
0:45:20,59 --> 0:45:22,51
way, but it's actually very
rare.


768
0:45:22,51 --> 0:45:24,909
Most people with autism do not
have any exceptional abilities


769
0:45:24,909 --> 0:45:25,87
that go along with it.


770
0:45:25,87 --> 0:45:31,98



771
0:45:31,98 --> 0:45:37,18
Another question is if you
believe in modules--If there are


772
0:45:37,18 --> 0:45:41,396
modules, what are they?
And so far when reviewing the


773
0:45:41,396 --> 0:45:45,125
developmental data we've talked
about two of them:


774
0:45:45,125 --> 0:45:49,261
physics and people.
An object module and a social


775
0:45:49,261 --> 0:45:51,453
module.
But other people have argued


776
0:45:51,453 --> 0:45:54,697
that there is a special module
in your brain for dealing with


777
0:45:54,697 --> 0:45:57,366
artifacts,
that is, things like tables and


778
0:45:57,366 --> 0:46:1,171
chairs and cars and forks.
Some people have argued there's


779
0:46:1,171 --> 0:46:4,748
a module for sociology,
for dealing with human groups,


780
0:46:4,748 --> 0:46:8,578
races and classes and so on.
Some have even argued that


781
0:46:8,578 --> 0:46:12,257
there is an intuitive biology,
a common-sense biological


782
0:46:12,257 --> 0:46:15,667
understanding of the world
that's separate from your


783
0:46:15,667 --> 0:46:18,409
understanding of people and
physics.


784
0:46:18,409 --> 0:46:22,67
And, in fact,
the most dominant proponent of


785
0:46:22,67 --> 0:46:25,3
the view is our very own Frank
Keil,


786
0:46:25,3 --> 0:46:29,92
Master of Morse College at
Yale, who has strongly defended


787
0:46:29,92 --> 0:46:33,73
the notion of an intuitive
biological module.


788
0:46:33,73 --> 0:46:35,907
Final question,
just to raise:


789
0:46:35,907 --> 0:46:40,38
I've talked in terms of the
modular view but there might


790
0:46:40,38 --> 0:46:44,243
also be profound general
differences between children and


791
0:46:44,243 --> 0:46:46,369
adults,
not just specific to how you


792
0:46:46,369 --> 0:46:48,79
think about objects or how you
think about people or how you


793
0:46:48,79 --> 0:46:50,76
think about this or how you
think about that,


794
0:46:50,76 --> 0:46:53,211
but rather more general.
And one claim,


795
0:46:53,211 --> 0:46:57,94
which we're going to return to
briefly next class when we talk


796
0:46:57,94 --> 0:46:59,923
about language,
is that there's a very,


797
0:46:59,923 --> 0:47:3,95
very big difference between a
creature that doesn't have


798
0:47:3,95 --> 0:47:6,659
language and a creature that
does.


799
0:47:6,659 --> 0:47:9,971
And part of the claim is that
learning a language,


800
0:47:9,971 --> 0:47:13,282
learning to speak,
reconfigures the human brain in


801
0:47:13,282 --> 0:47:16,119
such a way that is really
exceptional.


802
0:47:16,119 --> 0:47:19,369
And that has no parallel in any
other species.


803
0:47:19,369 --> 0:47:24,57
And this is an interesting
claim and one we'll talk about.


804
0:47:24,57 --> 0:47:29,14
Finally, I want to end with an
example from Stephen Jay Gould.


805
0:47:29,14 --> 0:47:33,485
Suppose you hate development;
you hate developmental


806
0:47:33,485 --> 0:47:35,3
psychology;
you hate babies;


807
0:47:35,3 --> 0:47:37,28
you hate children;
they're not cute;


808
0:47:37,28 --> 0:47:39,26
they're ugly;
you don't want to have them;


809
0:47:39,26 --> 0:47:41,722
you don't want to study them;
you're annoyed that we have to


810
0:47:41,722 --> 0:47:43,739
discuss them.
Fine.


811
0:47:43,739 --> 0:47:49,294
But there are reasons to study
development even if you are not


812
0:47:49,294 --> 0:47:54,848
interested in children because
sometimes developmental studies


813
0:47:54,848 --> 0:48:0,129
and developmental data and
developmental science can inform


814
0:48:0,129 --> 0:48:3,885
questions about adults.
And Stephen Jay Gould has a


815
0:48:3,885 --> 0:48:7,302
very nice example of this.
He asked the question "Is a


816
0:48:7,302 --> 0:48:12,504
zebra a black animal with white
stripes or a white animal with


817
0:48:12,504 --> 0:48:15,843
black stripes?"
Now, you could look at adult


818
0:48:15,843 --> 0:48:19,9
zebras all day long and you're
never going to figure this out.


819
0:48:19,9 --> 0:48:22,36
But if you want to know the
answer, and I knew it,


820
0:48:22,36 --> 0:48:24,619
but I forget what it is--It
doesn't matter.


821
0:48:24,619 --> 0:48:26,82
But if you wanted to know it
you could.


822
0:48:26,82 --> 0:48:29,3
You would look at development
and you'd watch the


823
0:48:29,3 --> 0:48:31,731
embryological development of a
zebra and that's how you would


824
0:48:31,731 --> 0:48:33,46
learn the answer to your
question.


825
0:48:33,46 --> 0:48:36,28
In fact, I'll end with a nice
quote.


826
0:48:36,28 --> 0:48:40,447
This is by the famous
biologist, D'Arcy Thompson,


827
0:48:40,447 --> 0:48:44,179
who wrote the book On Growth
and Form,


828
0:48:44,179 --> 0:48:47,233
 and it's sort of the model
of many developmental


829
0:48:47,233 --> 0:48:50,229
psychologists and many
evolutionary psychologists so


830
0:48:50,229 --> 0:48:52,989
I'll end with this:
"Everything is the way it is


831
0:48:52,989 --> 0:48:55,68
because it got that way."
Okay.


832
0:48:55,68 --> 0:50:55,68
I'll see you next week.
