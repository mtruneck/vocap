0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,65
STEVE SPANGLER: All right.


2
0:0:0,65 --> 0:0:1,9
Well, today is a good day.


3
0:0:1,9 --> 0:0:3,48
My chemistry teacher
is coming over.


4
0:0:3,48 --> 0:0:5,15
I know the secret to
get him over here.


5
0:0:5,15 --> 0:0:6,6
I want to show him a demo.


6
0:0:6,6 --> 0:0:7,76
All I have do is put a
lot of food out, and


7
0:0:7,76 --> 0:0:8,81
everything is just fine.


8
0:0:8,81 --> 0:0:10,88
So mix up a little bit
of this for lunch.


9
0:0:10,88 --> 0:0:12,66
This is a variation of something
he taught me


10
0:0:12,66 --> 0:0:14,19
over 25 years ago.


11
0:0:14,19 --> 0:0:15,67
The old is forever new.


12
0:0:15,67 --> 0:0:18,68
And chances are he'll have no
memory that he taught me this


13
0:0:18,68 --> 0:0:20,12
25 years ago.

0:0:20,12 --> 0:0:20,44
[MUSIC PLAYING]


15
0:0:20,44 --> 0:0:21,76
STEVE SPANGLER: I'm
Steve Spangler.


16
0:0:21,76 --> 0:0:23,5
And I'm all about making
science fun.


17
0:0:23,5 --> 0:0:26,66
For the last 20 years, I've
been teaching ways to turn


18
0:0:26,66 --> 0:0:29,67
ordinary science experiments
into unforgettable learning


19
0:0:29,67 --> 0:0:30,68
experiences.


20
0:0:30,68 --> 0:0:33,31
I have an amazing team who will
do whatever it takes to


21
0:0:33,31 --> 0:0:35,525
affect the way people
think about science.


22
0:0:35,525 --> 0:0:39,76
And to do that, I live by one
motto, make it big, do it


23
0:0:39,76 --> 0:0:41,855
right, give it class.


24
0:0:41,855 --> 0:0:47,8
[MUSIC PLAYING]


25
0:0:47,8 --> 0:0:49,67
STEVE SPANGLER: Oh, here he is,
my first chemistry teacher


26
0:0:49,67 --> 0:0:51,93
ever, the amazing Doug Houdus.


27
0:0:51,93 --> 0:0:53,16
DOUG HOUDUS: Hi, Steve.


28
0:0:53,16 --> 0:0:54,433
How are you?


29
0:0:54,433 --> 0:0:55,62
Geez, where is--


30
0:0:55,62 --> 0:0:57,65
I thought you said we
were having lunch?


31
0:0:57,65 --> 0:0:58,33
STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah.


32
0:0:58,33 --> 0:0:59,82
And I thought you were going
to be here two hours ago.


33
0:0:59,82 --> 0:1:2,25
Did the home, the nursing
home bus not pick


34
0:1:2,25 --> 0:1:3,54
you up on time or--


35
0:1:3,54 --> 0:1:4,61
DOUG HOUDUS: Well,
what day is this?


36
0:1:4,61 --> 0:1:5,566
STEVE SPANGLER: Thank you.


37
0:1:5,566 --> 0:1:6,458
DOUG HOUDUS: OK.


38
0:1:6,458 --> 0:1:7,15
I thought this was Thursday.


39
0:1:7,15 --> 0:1:9,596
STEVE SPANGLER: Oh my god This
is going to be a long taping.


40
0:1:9,596 --> 0:1:11,13
Here's what I'd like
you to do.


41
0:1:11,13 --> 0:1:14,35
I have got a new demo for you
that I thought it would be fun


42
0:1:14,35 --> 0:1:14,77
to show you.


43
0:1:14,77 --> 0:1:15,42
DOUG HOUDUS: Oh, excellent.


44
0:1:15,42 --> 0:1:16,87
STEVE SPANGLER: I just made it
a little bit bigger in size.


45
0:1:16,87 --> 0:1:18,8
So, here, watch this.


46
0:1:18,8 --> 0:1:19,53
So it uses an Erlenmeyer
flask.


47
0:1:19,53 --> 0:1:20,1
DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah.


48
0:1:20,1 --> 0:1:21,51
STEVE SPANGLER: And of
course, safe science.


49
0:1:21,51 --> 0:1:22,114
DOUG HOUDUS: Oh, you
always have to


50
0:1:22,114 --> 0:1:22,51
have your safety glasses.


51
0:1:22,51 --> 0:1:24,21
STEVE SPANGLER: Put your
safety glasses on.


52
0:1:24,21 --> 0:1:26,23
Isn't it weird that I'm
now telling you this?


53
0:1:26,23 --> 0:1:26,93
Isn't that strange?


54
0:1:26,93 --> 0:1:28,755
DOUG HOUDUS: I think
it's great.


55
0:1:28,755 --> 0:1:29,32
STEVE SPANGLER: All right.


56
0:1:29,32 --> 0:1:30,54
So here's what we're
going to do.


57
0:1:30,54 --> 0:1:32,2
There's fire, and then
there's a balloon.


58
0:1:32,2 --> 0:1:34,88
So instead of doing
the classic way,


59
0:1:34,88 --> 0:1:36,13
this is a water balloon.


60
0:1:36,13 --> 0:1:36,46
Got it?


61
0:1:36,46 --> 0:1:36,93
DOUG HOUDUS: Uh-huh.


62
0:1:36,93 --> 0:1:38,55
STEVE SPANGLER: So the object is
to put the water balloon in


63
0:1:38,55 --> 0:1:38,94
the bottle.


64
0:1:38,94 --> 0:1:39,42
DOUG HOUDUS: OK.


65
0:1:39,42 --> 0:1:40,49
STEVE SPANGLER: So here's how
we get the water balloon in


66
0:1:40,49 --> 0:1:41,19
the bottle.


67
0:1:41,19 --> 0:1:42,19
We have to have paper here.


68
0:1:42,19 --> 0:1:44,92
So you can light the
paper on fire.


69
0:1:44,92 --> 0:1:46,25
I know you're pretty
excited about this.


70
0:1:46,25 --> 0:1:47,62
But you get to be in
charge of this.


71
0:1:47,62 --> 0:1:47,84
OK.


72
0:1:47,84 --> 0:1:48,236
DOUG HOUDUS: Wow.


73
0:1:48,236 --> 0:1:48,434
I love fire.


74
0:1:48,434 --> 0:1:48,5
I--


75
0:1:48,5 --> 0:1:50,1
STEVE SPANGLER: In today's
day and age, this


76
0:1:50,1 --> 0:1:50,97
is how we make fires.


77
0:1:50,97 --> 0:1:51,25
This is--


78
0:1:51,25 --> 0:1:52,16
DOUG HOUDUS: We don't
need a match.


79
0:1:52,16 --> 0:1:54,58
STEVE SPANGLER: This is a little
stick that you squeeze,


80
0:1:54,58 --> 0:1:56,9
like magic, fire comes out.


81
0:1:56,9 --> 0:1:56,35
All right.


82
0:1:56,35 --> 0:1:57,463
So you're ready?


83
0:1:57,463 --> 0:1:58,17
All right.


84
0:1:58,17 --> 0:1:59,9
So light it up.


85
0:1:59,9 --> 0:2:0,777
DOUG HOUDUS: You really
want to get a good,


86
0:2:0,777 --> 0:2:1,62
good flame, like this.


87
0:2:1,62 --> 0:2:1,9
STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah.


88
0:2:1,9 --> 0:2:2,7
There you go.


89
0:2:2,7 --> 0:2:3,198
So a good flame that
goes down inside.


90
0:2:3,198 --> 0:2:3,265
Nice.


91
0:2:3,265 --> 0:2:3,754
DOUG HOUDUS: Put
that in there.


92
0:2:3,754 --> 0:2:3,87
Oh, perfect.


93
0:2:3,87 --> 0:2:5,22
STEVE SPANGLER: So this
goes here like this.


94
0:2:5,22 --> 0:2:6,6
DOUG HOUDUS: Oh, look
at it vibrate.


95
0:2:6,6 --> 0:2:7,27
STEVE SPANGLER: All over
the [INAUDIBLE].


96
0:2:7,27 --> 0:2:7,654
Good.


97
0:2:7,654 --> 0:2:8,31
Here it goes.


98
0:2:8,31 --> 0:2:8,509
All right.


99
0:2:8,509 --> 0:2:9,13
Come on baby.


100
0:2:9,13 --> 0:2:9,55
Come on.


101
0:2:9,55 --> 0:2:9,87

102
0:2:9,87 --> 0:2:10,78
DOUG HOUDUS: Oh, wow.


103
0:2:10,78 --> 0:2:11,97
STEVE SPANGLER: Yes.


104
0:2:11,97 --> 0:2:12,69
That's good, huh?


105
0:2:12,69 --> 0:2:13,61
DOUG HOUDUS: That's
really good.


106
0:2:13,61 --> 0:2:14,6
STEVE SPANGLER: Because
it's visual.


107
0:2:14,6 --> 0:2:15,785
It's huge for an audience.


108
0:2:15,785 --> 0:2:16,37
DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah.


109
0:2:16,37 --> 0:2:17,25
It's bigger.


110
0:2:17,25 --> 0:2:18,69
I never had a flask like this.


111
0:2:18,69 --> 0:2:20,4
Where did you get a
flask like this?


112
0:2:20,4 --> 0:2:22,72
STEVE SPANGLER: Actually, from
your lab, so that's why you


113
0:2:22,72 --> 0:2:24,0
didn't have a flask like that.


114
0:2:24,0 --> 0:2:24,64
DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah.


115
0:2:24,64 --> 0:2:25,7
STEVE SPANGLER: You know, right
before you retired--


116
0:2:25,7 --> 0:2:25,52
DOUG HOUDUS: I was
just wondering.


117
0:2:25,52 --> 0:2:27,165
STEVE SPANGLER: --obviously,
that came to you.


118
0:2:27,165 --> 0:2:28,73
Now it's mine.


119
0:2:28,73 --> 0:2:30,21
DOUG HOUDUS: I was wondering
if we could do it--


120
0:2:30,21 --> 0:2:31,2
STEVE SPANGLER: When
you had your--


121
0:2:31,2 --> 0:2:31,64
DOUG HOUDUS: -- the old
traditional one.


122
0:2:31,64 --> 0:2:32,72
STEVE SPANGLER: -- that's
all you had.


123
0:2:32,72 --> 0:2:33,305
DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah.


124
0:2:33,305 --> 0:2:35,64
But I think everybody would like
to see the traditional


125
0:2:35,64 --> 0:2:37,6
one with the egg going
into the bottle.


126
0:2:37,6 --> 0:2:38,61
Is that possible?


127
0:2:38,61 --> 0:2:39,57
STEVE SPANGLER: It's
pretty easy.


128
0:2:39,57 --> 0:2:40,4
You just take an egg and
put it in the bottle.


129
0:2:40,4 --> 0:2:40,81
DOUG HOUDUS: Ohh, no, no, no.


130
0:2:40,81 --> 0:2:42,6
STEVE SPANGLER: How
hard is that?


131
0:2:42,6 --> 0:2:43,54
DOUG HOUDUS: What I want
you to see is this.


132
0:2:43,54 --> 0:2:45,12
And don't take your
eyes away from it.


133
0:2:45,12 --> 0:2:47,292
I want you see that egg actually
going bla, la, loo,


134
0:2:47,292 --> 0:2:48,345
loo, loo, a little fluttering.


135
0:2:48,345 --> 0:2:49,47
STEVE SPANGLER: How
does that go?


136
0:2:49,47 --> 0:2:50,32
DOUG HOUDUS: Bla, la,
loo, loo, loo.


137
0:2:50,32 --> 0:2:51,4
Can you do that?


138
0:2:51,4 --> 0:2:51,33
STEVE SPANGLER: No.


139
0:2:51,33 --> 0:2:51,65
I can't.


140
0:2:51,65 --> 0:2:52,28
DOUG HOUDUS: [INAUDIBLE].


141
0:2:52,28 --> 0:2:54,9
STEVE SPANGLER: OK.


142
0:2:54,9 --> 0:2:56,44
And what is the fluttering
action that we're seeing?


143
0:2:56,44 --> 0:2:57,72
DOUG HOUDUS: Well, let's
actually see


144
0:2:57,72 --> 0:2:58,87
how this takes place.


145
0:2:58,87 --> 0:2:59,23

146
0:2:59,23 --> 0:3:0,98
DOUG HOUDUS: And then we want
do the experiment of course


147
0:3:0,98 --> 0:3:3,32
first and the explanation
second.


148
0:3:3,32 --> 0:3:3,98
STEVE SPANGLER: You
know what this is?


149
0:3:3,98 --> 0:3:5,32
This is a fuse--


150
0:3:5,32 --> 0:3:5,52
DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah.


151
0:3:5,52 --> 0:3:6,378

you'll get going with this.


152
0:3:6,378 --> 0:3:6,43
All right.

get it going.


154
0:3:7,19 --> 0:3:7,46
OK.


155
0:3:7,46 --> 0:3:8,13
Now watch this.


156
0:3:8,13 --> 0:3:8,46

STEVE SPANGLER: It didn't?


161
0:3:13,78 --> 0:3:14,58
There was a little
bit of flutter.


162
0:3:14,58 --> 0:3:15,23
I saw that.


163
0:3:15,23 --> 0:3:15,85
DOUG HOUDUS: No,
there was not.


164

show there was a little


165
0:3:17,42 --> 0:3:18,71
fluttering.


166
0:3:18,71 --> 0:3:19,906
DOUG HOUDUS: Watch this.


167
0:3:19,906 --> 0:3:21,364
STEVE SPANGLER: Good.

170
0:3:26,224 --> 0:3:28,16
DOUG HOUDUS: It didn't
flutter.


171
0:3:28,16 --> 0:3:29,33
STEVE SPANGLER: It didn't?


172
0:3:29,33 --> 0:3:30,36
There is a little
bit of flutter.


173
0:3:30,36 --> 0:3:30,98
I saw that--


174
0:3:30,98 --> 0:3:31,6
DOUG HOUDUS: No,
there was not.


175
0:3:31,6 --> 0:3:33,17
STEVE SPANGLER: Video will
show there was a little


176
0:3:33,17 --> 0:3:33,79
fluttering.


177
0:3:33,79 --> 0:3:35,45
And I liked your way
of getting it in.


178
0:3:35,45 --> 0:3:38,28
So, again, just as
a quick review.


179
0:3:38,28 --> 0:3:41,59
The hot air that was inside,
as soon as you put the fire


180
0:3:41,59 --> 0:3:44,1
that goes down inside,
you now have all that


181
0:3:44,1 --> 0:3:45,4
air that heats up.


182
0:3:45,4 --> 0:3:47,44
As the air heats up, just as we
saw with the balloon and a


183
0:3:47,44 --> 0:3:49,65
little bit with this, you
see the air escaping


184
0:3:49,65 --> 0:3:50,72
from the very top.


185
0:3:50,72 --> 0:3:53,96
Then when the fire goes out,
that warm air inside begins to


186
0:3:53,96 --> 0:3:55,38
cool, contract.


187
0:3:55,38 --> 0:3:57,45
And the outside air pressure
pushes the


188
0:3:57,45 --> 0:3:57,95
egg into the bottle.


189
0:3:57,95 --> 0:3:59,62
DOUG HOUDUS: Well, the
gravity, also,


190
0:3:59,62 --> 0:4:1,13
because the egg has mass.


191
0:4:1,13 --> 0:4:2,75
And why I was trying to
get a little bit more


192
0:4:2,75 --> 0:4:3,31
fluttering in there--


193
0:4:3,31 --> 0:4:4,82
STEVE SPANGLER: Did you just
say gravity to me?


194
0:4:4,82 --> 0:4:6,97
Yes, the egg will fall
into the bottle.


195
0:4:6,97 --> 0:4:9,96
But don't you think the air
is pushing it in more than


196
0:4:9,96 --> 0:4:12,18
gravity is pulling it down?


197
0:4:12,18 --> 0:4:12,98
Here let's see how well--


198
0:4:12,98 --> 0:4:13,78
DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah.


199
0:4:13,78 --> 0:4:14,89
STEVE SPANGLER: --
gravity works.


200
0:4:14,89 --> 0:4:15,625
DOUG HOUDUS: Wait.


201
0:4:15,625 --> 0:4:17,269
STEVE SPANGLER: Let's just sit
here and wait for gravity.


202
0:4:17,269 --> 0:4:17,584
Hmmm.


203
0:4:17,584 --> 0:4:19,35

is doing?


204
0:4:19,35 --> 0:4:19,89
DOUG HOUDUS: No.


205
0:4:19,89 --> 0:4:21,5
STEVE SPANGLER: All that
gravity is pretty good.

0:4:21,5 --> 0:4:22,1
DOUG HOUDUS: No.


207
0:4:22,1 --> 0:4:22,48
Yeah.


208
0:4:22,48 --> 0:4:22,69
You were right.


209
0:4:22,69 --> 0:4:24,34
STEVE SPANGLER: Doug, I got
another way to put the egg


210
0:4:24,34 --> 0:4:25,0
inside the bottle.


211
0:4:25,0 --> 0:4:27,15
It's the upside down
egg in the bottle.


212
0:4:27,15 --> 0:4:27,8
DOUG HOUDUS: No,
it won't work.


213
0:4:27,8 --> 0:4:27,99
STEVE SPANGLER: It is.


214
0:4:27,99 --> 0:4:28,64
Watch this.


215
0:4:28,64 --> 0:4:30,7
DOUG HOUDUS: No, un-uh.


216
0:4:30,7 --> 0:4:31,76
STEVE SPANGLER: So new
Erlenmeyer flask.


217
0:4:31,76 --> 0:4:32,6
DOUG HOUDUS: OK.


218
0:4:32,6 --> 0:4:32,98
STEVE SPANGLER: Got it.


219
0:4:32,98 --> 0:4:34,98
And let's find an egg this time
that actually seals all


220
0:4:34,98 --> 0:4:35,63
the way around.


221
0:4:35,63 --> 0:4:35,92
All right.


222
0:4:35,92 --> 0:4:36,15
DOUG HOUDUS: [INAUDIBLE].


223
0:4:36,15 --> 0:4:37,28
STEVE SPANGLER: So why don't
we look and see if this--


224
0:4:37,28 --> 0:4:37,66
DOUG HOUDUS: OK.


225
0:4:37,66 --> 0:4:38,97
STEVE SPANGLER: You just want
to make sure there's a seal


226
0:4:38,97 --> 0:4:39,95
all the way around.


227
0:4:39,95 --> 0:4:40,21
OK.


228
0:4:40,21 --> 0:4:41,18
Perfect.


229
0:4:41,18 --> 0:4:43,49
In fact, that would
be even better.


230
0:4:43,49 --> 0:4:43,96
OK.


231
0:4:43,96 --> 0:4:45,3
So now watch.


232
0:4:45,3 --> 0:4:47,24
So now instead of putting paper
inside because you got


233
0:4:47,24 --> 0:4:48,32
to warm up the air inside.


234
0:4:48,32 --> 0:4:48,58
You--


235
0:4:48,58 --> 0:4:48,97
DOUG HOUDUS: Absolutely.


236
0:4:48,97 --> 0:4:50,0
STEVE SPANGLER: -- want
the air to escape.


237
0:4:50,0 --> 0:4:53,6
So now we just simply
put birthday candles


238
0:4:53,6 --> 0:4:54,37
down inside like this.


239
0:4:54,37 --> 0:4:55,19
DOUG HOUDUS: OK.


240
0:4:55,19 --> 0:4:55,6
Got it.


241
0:4:55,6 --> 0:4:57,4
STEVE SPANGLER: So here's a
little birthday candle.


242
0:4:57,4 --> 0:4:58,365
And here's your birthday
candle.


243
0:4:58,365 --> 0:5:0,3
DOUG HOUDUS: Can I light
it this time, Steve?


244
0:5:0,3 --> 0:5:1,3
STEVE SPANGLER: Yes.


245
0:5:1,3 --> 0:5:1,83
DOUG HOUDUS: All right.


246
0:5:1,83 --> 0:5:2,17
STEVE SPANGLER: OK.


247
0:5:2,17 --> 0:5:2,8
Here we go.


248
0:5:2,8 --> 0:5:3,2
Ready?


249
0:5:3,2 --> 0:5:3,765
DOUG HOUDUS: All right.


250
0:5:3,765 --> 0:5:4,77
STEVE SPANGLER: This
goes over the top.


251
0:5:4,77 --> 0:5:5,61
Watch how it works.


252
0:5:5,61 --> 0:5:6,7
It's here like this.


253
0:5:6,7 --> 0:5:6,775
DOUG HOUDUS: So we're going to
heat that air up inside again.


254
0:5:6,775 --> 0:5:7,72
STEVE SPANGLER: [INAUDIBLE]
air like this.


255
0:5:7,72 --> 0:5:7,756
Watch.


256
0:5:7,756 --> 0:5:8,166
See the fluttering?


257
0:5:8,166 --> 0:5:9,1
DOUG HOUDUS: [INAUDIBLE]
the air.


258
0:5:9,1 --> 0:5:10,45
STEVE SPANGLER: Watch
when it goes out.


259
0:5:10,45 --> 0:5:11,33
It's going to go out.


260
0:5:11,33 --> 0:5:12,16
DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah?


261
0:5:12,16 --> 0:5:12,392
[POP]


262
0:5:12,392 --> 0:5:13,2
DOUG HOUDUS: Amazing.


263
0:5:13,2 --> 0:5:14,65
STEVE SPANGLER: Ta-da!


264
0:5:14,65 --> 0:5:16,64
DOUG HOUDUS: So the
air heated up.


265
0:5:16,64 --> 0:5:18,52
STEVE SPANGLER: Upside down
egg in the bottle.


266
0:5:18,52 --> 0:5:19,39
Pops up.


267
0:5:19,39 --> 0:5:21,2
You could actually feel
the little fluttering


268
0:5:21,2 --> 0:5:21,34
that's going on.


269
0:5:21,34 --> 0:5:24,45
DOUG HOUDUS: So I guess maybe
it's just the air heating up


270
0:5:24,45 --> 0:5:26,33
instead of the gravity
doing it.


271
0:5:26,33 --> 0:5:28,69
STEVE SPANGLER: I don't think
gravity has anything to do


272
0:5:28,69 --> 0:5:29,91
with this, Doug.


273
0:5:29,91 --> 0:5:30,275
It's not--


274
0:5:30,275 --> 0:5:30,9
DOUG HOUDUS: [INAUDIBLE].


275
0:5:30,9 --> 0:5:32,27
STEVE SPANGLER: --
a gravity thing.


276
0:5:32,27 --> 0:5:33,6
Why did you say gravity?


277
0:5:33,6 --> 0:5:36,876
DOUG HOUDUS: I just wanted
to say gravity.


278
0:5:36,876 --> 0:5:39,812
STEVE SPANGLER: I don't know
why you would say gravity.


279
0:5:39,812 --> 0:5:40,37
DOUG HOUDUS: I [INAUDIBLE]


280
0:5:40,37 --> 0:5:41,26
STEVE SPANGLER: We got
to get the egg out.


281
0:5:41,26 --> 0:5:41,77
DOUG HOUDUS: OK.


282
0:5:41,77 --> 0:5:42,75
STEVE SPANGLER: And the way
you get the egg out is you


283
0:5:42,75 --> 0:5:45,75
just take a knife, and you kind
of cut it up inside--


284
0:5:45,75 --> 0:5:46,28
DOUG HOUDUS: No, no, no.


285
0:5:46,28 --> 0:5:47,3
We don't want to do that.


286
0:5:47,3 --> 0:5:48,615
That's not a scientific
way of doing it.


287
0:5:48,615 --> 0:5:51,94
Remember, we had a decrease in
air pressure, OK, and that


288
0:5:51,94 --> 0:5:56,4
made the egg actually fall in or
get sucked into the bottle.


289
0:5:56,4 --> 0:5:57,23
Now we want to is just
the opposite.


290
0:5:57,23 --> 0:5:57,94
STEVE SPANGLER: I'm so proud.


291
0:5:57,94 --> 0:6:0,376
That's exactly what was on the
script, and he remembered.


292
0:6:0,376 --> 0:6:2,165
DOUG HOUDUS: We're both going
to blow into the bottle.


293
0:6:2,165 --> 0:6:2,78
STEVE SPANGLER: Right.


294
0:6:2,78 --> 0:6:4,59
DOUG HOUDUS: And we're going to
create extra air in here,


295
0:6:4,59 --> 0:6:5,92
extra air pressure--


296
0:6:5,92 --> 0:6:6,41
STEVE SPANGLER: So you push
the air that's in here.


297
0:6:6,41 --> 0:6:7,21
DOUG HOUDUS: -- and that's
going to blow it out.


298
0:6:7,21 --> 0:6:7,76
STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah.


299
0:6:7,76 --> 0:6:8,33
And then air comes out.


300
0:6:8,33 --> 0:6:10,7
DOUG HOUDUS: But what happens
if we get the egg caught in


301
0:6:10,7 --> 0:6:11,53
our throat?


302
0:6:11,53 --> 0:6:12,44
STEVE SPANGLER: I don't know.


303
0:6:12,44 --> 0:6:13,17
You choke.


304
0:6:13,17 --> 0:6:13,75
DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah.


305
0:6:13,75 --> 0:6:16,6
But does anybody in here know
the Heimlich Maneuver?


306
0:6:16,6 --> 0:6:16,58
STEVE SPANGLER: Oh, I do.


307
0:6:16,58 --> 0:6:17,4
DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah.


308
0:6:17,4 --> 0:6:18,122
But you'll be doing the egg.


309
0:6:18,122 --> 0:6:19,45
STEVE SPANGLER: I'll help you.


310
0:6:19,45 --> 0:6:19,99
DOUG HOUDUS: OK.


311
0:6:19,99 --> 0:6:20,55
STEVE SPANGLER: I've
got your back.


312
0:6:20,55 --> 0:6:20,97
DOUG HOUDUS: OK.


313
0:6:20,97 --> 0:6:22,5
You got me back?


314
0:6:22,5 --> 0:6:22,64
STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah.


315
0:6:22,64 --> 0:6:23,46
DOUG HOUDUS: OK.


316
0:6:23,46 --> 0:6:24,4
STEVE SPANGLER: So
you're ready?


317
0:6:24,4 --> 0:6:25,2
This is a race?


318
0:6:25,2 --> 0:6:26,42
DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah.


319
0:6:26,42 --> 0:6:26,6
Wait.


320
0:6:26,6 --> 0:6:27,2
Three, two--


321
0:6:27,2 --> 0:6:28,506
STEVE SPANGLER: OK, I say,
three, two, one, go.


322
0:6:28,506 --> 0:6:28,994
OK?


323
0:6:28,994 --> 0:6:29,97
Ready?


324
0:6:29,97 --> 0:6:31,894
Three, two, one, go.


325
0:6:31,894 --> 0:6:32,372
[SWOOSH]


326
0:6:32,372 --> 0:6:34,51
STEVE SPANGLER: Oh, perfect.


327
0:6:34,51 --> 0:6:37,59
And this is my egg right
out of there.


328
0:6:37,59 --> 0:6:40,22
The most amazing thing that
can happen along the--


329
0:6:40,22 --> 0:6:41,11
oh, oh, I'm sorry.


330
0:6:41,11 --> 0:6:44,27
DOUG HOUDUS: Ahh.


331
0:6:44,27 --> 0:6:45,41
Ohh.


332
0:6:45,41 --> 0:6:48,265
Oh, my own student
saved my life.


333
0:6:48,265 --> 0:6:51,14
Oh, I am so thankful you
were here, Steve.


334
0:6:51,14 --> 0:6:52,63
You are my hero.


335
0:6:52,63 --> 0:6:53,88
Give me five.


336
0:6:53,88 --> 0:6:56,19
Oh.


337
0:6:56,19 --> 0:6:58,22
STEVE SPANGLER: I think
it's going well.


338
0:6:58,22 --> 0:6:59,43
Here's what I'm afraid.


339
0:6:59,43 --> 0:7:2,4
In all the kind of having fun,
that we might have missed the


340
0:7:2,4 --> 0:7:3,95
actual science behind this.


341
0:7:3,95 --> 0:7:6,5
So let's do it again using what
people would normally


342
0:7:6,5 --> 0:7:6,81
probably use.


343
0:7:6,81 --> 0:7:7,53
DOUG HOUDUS: [INAUDIBLE].


344
0:7:7,53 --> 0:7:8,75
STEVE SPANGLER: In fact, I have
to tell you that this


345
0:7:8,75 --> 0:7:11,8
technique was really shared by
Don Herbert, so Mr. Wizard


346
0:7:11,8 --> 0:7:15,68
shared it with me in about 1997
or 1998 at Sacred Heart


347
0:7:15,68 --> 0:7:18,4
University when he was
doing a presentation.


348
0:7:18,4 --> 0:7:20,71
He said that over the years
that he found that a water


349
0:7:20,71 --> 0:7:22,39
balloon worked even
better than that.


350
0:7:22,39 --> 0:7:24,2
So I made this water balloon.


351
0:7:24,2 --> 0:7:26,38
Of course, it's bigger, and it
would be impossible to push it


352
0:7:26,38 --> 0:7:27,7
in the bottle.


353
0:7:27,7 --> 0:7:28,69
One of the reasons why
is because there's


354
0:7:28,69 --> 0:7:29,56
air inside the bottle.


355
0:7:29,56 --> 0:7:32,7
So when you push down like this,
you can't get it down


356
0:7:32,7 --> 0:7:32,71
inside the bottle.


357
0:7:32,71 --> 0:7:33,84
DOUG HOUDUS: You're
forcing the air.


358
0:7:33,84 --> 0:7:34,39
STEVE SPANGLER: Correct.


359
0:7:34,39 --> 0:7:37,47
So the object here is this, is
if we use the fire here like


360
0:7:37,47 --> 0:7:40,93
this, and we heat it up, as
you heat up the air, the


361
0:7:40,93 --> 0:7:43,1
molecules will move away
from each other.


362
0:7:43,1 --> 0:7:44,31
It forces the hot air out.


363
0:7:44,31 --> 0:7:46,64
That's the fluttering that you
said that you saw before.


364
0:7:46,64 --> 0:7:49,46
And then when it cools down, as
soon as this goes out, you


365
0:7:49,46 --> 0:7:52,23
see, it cools down, the air
contracts, and the outside air


366
0:7:52,23 --> 0:7:53,107
pressure kind of pushes
down inside.


367
0:7:53,107 --> 0:7:54,37
DOUG HOUDUS: That air goes
up 30 miles, and


368
0:7:54,37 --> 0:7:55,0
it's pushing down.


369
0:7:55,0 --> 0:7:56,81
STEVE SPANGLER: Tremendous
amount.


370
0:7:56,81 --> 0:7:58,69
And the other secret here is
sometimes I'll get this a


371
0:7:58,69 --> 0:8:1,21
little wet just so that it will
slip past here a little


372
0:8:1,21 --> 0:8:1,675
bit easier.


373
0:8:1,675 --> 0:8:2,74
DOUG HOUDUS: That's an
[INAUDIBLE] idea.


374
0:8:2,74 --> 0:8:3,48
STEVE SPANGLER: That's kind
of what's going on there.


375
0:8:3,48 --> 0:8:4,53
You handle the fire.


376
0:8:4,53 --> 0:8:4,96
DOUG HOUDUS: I will.


377
0:8:4,96 --> 0:8:5,67
STEVE SPANGLER: And we'll
do it together.


378
0:8:5,67 --> 0:8:5,81
Ready?


379
0:8:5,81 --> 0:8:6,24
DOUG HOUDUS: All right.


380
0:8:6,24 --> 0:8:6,72
STEVE SPANGLER: So
this goes in.


381
0:8:6,72 --> 0:8:8,33
We're going to get this burning
pretty well because we


382
0:8:8,33 --> 0:8:9,82
need to have that fire
down inside.


383
0:8:9,82 --> 0:8:11,17
And you'll actually see
the fluttering here.


384
0:8:11,17 --> 0:8:11,47
So this goes in.


385
0:8:11,47 --> 0:8:12,3
DOUG HOUDUS: We want
to heat up that air


386
0:8:12,3 --> 0:8:13,312
inside really good.


387
0:8:13,312 --> 0:8:15,38
STEVE SPANGLER: So listen,
hear the fluttering?


388
0:8:15,38 --> 0:8:15,85
[BANG]


389
0:8:15,85 --> 0:8:16,735
DOUG HOUDUS: Whoa.


390
0:8:16,735 --> 0:8:17,15
Wow.


391
0:8:17,15 --> 0:8:17,85
STEVE SPANGLER: Bam.


392
0:8:17,85 --> 0:8:19,6
Isn't that a great one?


393
0:8:19,6 --> 0:8:20,2
DOUG HOUDUS: That
is excellent.


394
0:8:20,2 --> 0:8:21,825
I think much more dramatic.


395
0:8:21,825 --> 0:8:24,12
STEVE SPANGLER: Now the kicker
here is getting it out.


396
0:8:24,12 --> 0:8:26,156
Using the egg, you can
kind of blow in and


397
0:8:26,156 --> 0:8:26,63
kind of get it out.


398
0:8:26,63 --> 0:8:28,71
But I have not found good
success this way.


399
0:8:28,71 --> 0:8:31,74
And it's fun to have people
try to do it like this, so


400
0:8:31,74 --> 0:8:33,5
it's almost like a bet.


401
0:8:33,5 --> 0:8:34,22
DOUG HOUDUS: Oh, yeah.


402
0:8:34,22 --> 0:8:36,2
STEVE SPANGLER: Can you
get the balloon out?


403
0:8:36,2 --> 0:8:37,74
DOUG HOUDUS: You're creating a
slight vacuum back here when


404
0:8:37,74 --> 0:8:38,549
you're doing that.


405
0:8:38,549 --> 0:8:38,78
STEVE SPANGLER: Right.


406
0:8:38,78 --> 0:8:41,99
So I could say, I'll give you
$20 if you can get the balloon


407
0:8:41,99 --> 0:8:43,5
out of the bottle.


408
0:8:43,5 --> 0:8:44,515
DOUG HOUDUS: How about $100?


409
0:8:44,515 --> 0:8:45,86
STEVE SPANGLER: How about $20?


410
0:8:45,86 --> 0:8:46,6
All right.


411
0:8:46,6 --> 0:8:48,225
So how would you
do that, Doug?


412
0:8:48,225 --> 0:8:50,37
DOUG HOUDUS: I think if you had
something like a straw,


413
0:8:50,37 --> 0:8:52,52
you could actually put it
along the side here.


414
0:8:52,52 --> 0:8:54,1
STEVE SPANGLER: Look at what
your star student has.


415
0:8:54,1 --> 0:8:54,75
DOUG HOUDUS: Wow.


416
0:8:54,75 --> 0:8:55,82
STEVE SPANGLER: A straw.


417
0:8:55,82 --> 0:8:56,765
DOUG HOUDUS: Where did
you get that at?


418
0:8:56,765 --> 0:8:58,52
STEVE SPANGLER: Watch this.


419
0:8:58,52 --> 0:8:59,455
So here we go.


420
0:8:59,455 --> 0:9:1,43
We push this down
here like this.


421
0:9:1,43 --> 0:9:2,2
DOUG HOUDUS: Yes.


422
0:9:2,2 --> 0:9:3,3
STEVE SPANGLER: All your--


423
0:9:3,3 --> 0:9:3,575
[SHHHHH]


424
0:9:3,575 --> 0:9:4,98
STEVE SPANGLER: Did you hear
that little shhhh there?


425
0:9:4,98 --> 0:9:5,59
DOUG HOUDUS: Yes.


426
0:9:5,59 --> 0:9:6,6
STEVE SPANGLER: So now watch.


427
0:9:6,6 --> 0:9:8,44
If we stick a straw down
inside like this.


428
0:9:8,44 --> 0:9:8,86
OK.


429
0:9:8,86 --> 0:9:10,2
And this is here.


430
0:9:10,2 --> 0:9:10,46
DOUG HOUDUS: Ahhh.


431
0:9:10,46 --> 0:9:12,16
You're going to avoid that
vacuum creation, huh.


432
0:9:12,16 --> 0:9:15,1
STEVE SPANGLER: So now if we
pull like this, we should be


433
0:9:15,1 --> 0:9:19,0
able to let the air come in
and the balloon come out.


434
0:9:19,0 --> 0:9:19,27
[POP]


435
0:9:19,27 --> 0:9:20,5
STEVE SPANGLER: Ahh.


436
0:9:20,5 --> 0:9:21,11
DOUG HOUDUS: Don't you
just love science?


437
0:9:21,11 --> 0:9:22,2
STEVE SPANGLER: Isn't
that good?


438
0:9:22,2 --> 0:9:23,9
But there's something
you need to know.


439
0:9:23,9 --> 0:9:26,3
You don't have to use fire to
get the egg into the bottle.


440
0:9:26,3 --> 0:9:30,5
Here's the solution, 320
degrees below zero.


441
0:9:30,5 --> 0:9:31,52
So we had heat.


442
0:9:31,52 --> 0:9:33,56
This time why don't we
go to extreme cold.


443
0:9:33,56 --> 0:9:35,23
And this is perfect.


444
0:9:35,23 --> 0:9:37,63
So this is our bath of
liquid nitrogen.


445
0:9:37,63 --> 0:9:39,84
And unlike using the other
bottles that we were playing


446
0:9:39,84 --> 0:9:41,65
with before, you have
to use an Erlenmeyer


447
0:9:41,65 --> 0:9:42,465
flask for this one.


448
0:9:42,465 --> 0:9:42,6
Got it?


449
0:9:42,6 --> 0:9:44,76
DOUG HOUDUS: That's because
it won't crack.


450
0:9:44,76 --> 0:9:46,88
STEVE SPANGLER: So here's what
we're going to do with this.


451
0:9:46,88 --> 0:9:49,71
If we got it hot on the first
time, and it forced the air


452
0:9:49,71 --> 0:9:52,47
out, and then when it cooled
down, the outside pressure


453
0:9:52,47 --> 0:9:55,27
pushed it in, why don't we start
with the air at room


454
0:9:55,27 --> 0:9:58,63
temperature, put this on top,
and submerge it in here, get


455
0:9:58,63 --> 0:10:0,562
it cold, and see if the
contraction will allow that to


456
0:10:0,562 --> 0:10:0,78
push it in?


457
0:10:0,78 --> 0:10:2,31
DOUG HOUDUS: So we're going to
see if some of those molecules


458
0:10:2,31 --> 0:10:3,68
will actually come a
little bit closer,


459
0:10:3,68 --> 0:10:4,99
creating a partial vacuum.


460
0:10:4,99 --> 0:10:5,51
STEVE SPANGLER: All right.


461
0:10:5,51 --> 0:10:5,92
You're ready?


462
0:10:5,92 --> 0:10:7,6
This goes on top
here like this.


463
0:10:7,6 --> 0:10:11,77
And now we put it in the liquid
nitrogen like this.


464
0:10:11,77 --> 0:10:13,55
Make sure that we've
got a good seal.


465
0:10:13,55 --> 0:10:15,64
It's getting colder.


466
0:10:15,64 --> 0:10:16,79
It's getting colder.


467
0:10:16,79 --> 0:10:18,235
Doug, it's working.


468
0:10:18,235 --> 0:10:19,65
DOUG HOUDUS: It is.


469
0:10:19,65 --> 0:10:19,49
STEVE SPANGLER: Bam.


470
0:10:19,49 --> 0:10:20,58
DOUG HOUDUS: Excellent.


471
0:10:20,58 --> 0:10:23,5
STEVE SPANGLER: That is
how to get the egg--


472
0:10:23,5 --> 0:10:23,71
DOUG HOUDUS: Very, very cool.


473
0:10:23,71 --> 0:10:24,16
STEVE SPANGLER: --
in the bottle.


474
0:10:24,16 --> 0:10:25,21
Isn't that cool?


475
0:10:25,21 --> 0:10:25,76
DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah.


476
0:10:25,76 --> 0:10:26,86
STEVE SPANGLER: Sticking
to the bottle.


477
0:10:26,86 --> 0:10:27,81
[BANG, BANG]


478
0:10:27,81 --> 0:10:28,32
DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah, it is.


479
0:10:28,32 --> 0:10:28,65
Maybe because it's cold.


480
0:10:28,65 --> 0:10:30,1
STEVE SPANGLER: There
it is, bingo.


481
0:10:30,1 --> 0:10:30,78
Here's a cool thing.


482
0:10:30,78 --> 0:10:33,15
You could possibly get the egg
back out of the bottle.


483
0:10:33,15 --> 0:10:35,62
You have to warm this
part of it up.


484
0:10:35,62 --> 0:10:36,54
DOUG HOUDUS: OK.


485
0:10:36,54 --> 0:10:37,84
STEVE SPANGLER: Do you do
pretty good clucking?


486
0:10:37,84 --> 0:10:39,414
Can you go [CLUCKS LIKE ?


487
0:10:39,414 --> 0:10:40,82
CHICKEN].


488
0:10:40,82 --> 0:10:43,0
DOUG HOUDUS: Do I have to
scratch while I'm doing that?


489
0:10:43,0 --> 0:10:44,11
STEVE SPANGLER: Can you do--


490
0:10:44,11 --> 0:10:44,69
DOUG HOUDUS: [CLUCKS
LIKE A CHICKEN].


491
0:10:44,69 --> 0:10:45,3
STEVE SPANGLER: Hold
on to this.


492
0:10:45,3 --> 0:10:45,28
Hold onto this.


493
0:10:45,28 --> 0:10:46,44
And just make chicken sounds.


494
0:10:46,44 --> 0:10:46,56
Hold on right here.


495
0:10:46,56 --> 0:10:48,354
DOUG HOUDUS: [CLUCKS
LIKE A CHICKEN]


496
0:10:48,354 --> 0:10:48,866
STEVE SPANGLER: OK.


497
0:10:48,866 --> 0:10:49,124
Hold onto it.


498
0:10:49,124 --> 0:10:49,845
You can do it.


499
0:10:49,845 --> 0:10:50,46
DOUG HOUDUS: OK.


500
0:10:50,46 --> 0:10:52,31
We've got to warm this
up and increase the


501
0:10:52,31 --> 0:10:53,73
pressure, right at this--


502
0:10:53,73 --> 0:10:54,46
STEVE SPANGLER: Just
warm it up.


503
0:10:54,46 --> 0:10:54,93
DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah.


504
0:10:54,93 --> 0:10:55,615
STEVE SPANGLER: Use our hands.


505
0:10:55,615 --> 0:10:55,92
Warm it.


506
0:10:55,92 --> 0:10:56,56
DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah.


507
0:10:56,56 --> 0:10:57,195
Use your hands.


508
0:10:57,195 --> 0:10:57,51
STEVE SPANGLER: Come on.


509
0:10:57,51 --> 0:10:58,26
Come on.


510
0:10:58,26 --> 0:11:0,4
[CLUCKING LIKE CHICKENS]


511
0:11:0,4 --> 0:11:3,45
DOUG HOUDUS: Maybe if I
scratch a little bit.


512
0:11:3,45 --> 0:11:13,655
[CLUCKING LIKE CHICKENS]


513
0:11:13,655 --> 0:11:14,31
STEVE SPANGLER: Come on.


514
0:11:14,31 --> 0:11:15,7
Do it harder.


515
0:11:15,7 --> 0:11:16,528
[CLUCKING LIKE CHICKENS]


516
0:11:16,528 --> 0:11:17,5
STEVE SPANGLER: Ahh.


517
0:11:17,5 --> 0:11:18,25
DOUG HOUDUS: It did--


518
0:11:18,25 --> 0:11:18,74
[COUGHS].


519
0:11:18,74 --> 0:11:19,55
STEVE SPANGLER: Isn't
that great?


520
0:11:19,55 --> 0:11:20,55
Are you OK?


521
0:11:20,55 --> 0:11:20,69
DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah.


522
0:11:20,69 --> 0:11:21,95
I have a cold, see.


523
0:11:21,95 --> 0:11:22,85
STEVE SPANGLER: This
is your lunch.


524
0:11:22,85 --> 0:11:24,24
DOUG HOUDUS: Wait a minute.


525
0:11:24,24 --> 0:11:24,72
STEVE SPANGLER: There you go.


526
0:11:24,72 --> 0:11:24,88
There's your lunch.


527
0:11:24,88 --> 0:11:25,34
DOUG HOUDUS: Thank you.


528
0:11:25,34 --> 0:11:25,77
STEVE SPANGLER: Thank you.


529
0:11:25,77 --> 0:11:26,9
DOUG HOUDUS: This is what
I came here for?


530
0:11:26,9 --> 0:11:27,94
STEVE SPANGLER: Oh, guess
what I hear right now?


531
0:11:27,94 --> 0:11:28,355
Beep, beep.


532
0:11:28,355 --> 0:11:29,33
Oh, that's the bus.


533
0:11:29,33 --> 0:11:30,37
The bus is here.


534
0:11:30,37 --> 0:11:31,76
DOUG HOUDUS: Oh, it is?


535
0:11:31,76 --> 0:11:32,5
Will I be going back
to the home?


536
0:11:32,5 --> 0:11:33,3
STEVE SPANGLER: [SINGING]


537
0:11:33,3 --> 0:11:35,1
The wheels on the bus
go round and round--

See you later.

DOUG HOUDUS: Bye-bye.


545
0:11:40,38 --> 0:11:40,89
STEVE SPANGLER: Bye-bye.


546
0:11:40,89 --> 0:11:41,62
DOUG HOUDUS: See you again.


547
0:11:41,62 --> 0:11:45,1
STEVE SPANGLER: Thank you.


548
0:11:45,1 --> 0:11:46,26
I think that went pretty well.

0:11:46,26 --> 0:11:49,6

0:12:0,62 --> 0:12:2,5
STEVE SPANGLER: Oh,
my goodness.


552
0:12:2,5 --> 0:12:4,12
DOUG HOUDUS: It's on fire now.


553
0:12:4,12 --> 0:12:6,64
It's still on fire.


554
0:12:6,64 --> 0:12:7,165
STEVE SPANGLER: The [BLEEP]


555
0:12:7,165 --> 0:12:7,535
are you thinking?


556
0:12:7,535 --> 0:12:10,5
DOUG HOUDUS: Well, he said
he wanted a good fire.


557
0:12:10,5 --> 0:12:10,79
STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah.


558
0:12:10,79 --> 0:12:13,57
DOUG HOUDUS: I'm going to hold
this piece of [BLEEP]


559
0:12:13,57 --> 0:12:14,82
in my hand--
