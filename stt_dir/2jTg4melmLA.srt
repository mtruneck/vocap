1
0:0:2,72 --> 0:0:9,64
MS. NULAND: All right, everybody. Happy Friday.
We are late. I apologize for that, but there


2
0:0:9,64 --> 0:0:14,87
were more interesting things going on at the
White House with personnel announcements today.


3
0:0:14,87 --> 0:0:17,41
I have a bunch of things at the top.


4
0:0:17,41 --> 0:0:26,929
I want to start by noting that our Reuters
colleague and Arshad's partner, Andy Quinn,


5
0:0:26,929 --> 0:0:32,95
is moving on after 25 years at Reuters and
more than three years here at the State Department.


6
0:0:32,95 --> 0:0:39,5
He's heading to the Aspen Institute to lead
a new Africa-focused program. Those of you


7
0:0:39,5 --> 0:0:46,49
who are briefing regulars know that Andy is
an extraordinary colleague, that he was completely


8
0:0:46,49 --> 0:0:53,94
committed to the story and to reporting it
with integrity and with passion. He was also


9
0:0:53,94 --> 0:0:59,46
a joy to travel with and to be with. We're
going to miss you, Andy, but we're very glad


10
0:0:59,46 --> 0:1:6,43
that you're staying in the foreign policy
realm and continuing to contribute internationally.


11
0:1:6,43 --> 0:1:14,78
I have one other thing, which is with regard
to the Jordanian parliamentary elections.


12
0:1:14,78 --> 0:1:19,21
We want to take this opportunity, since we
didn't brief yesterday right after the elections,


13
0:1:19,21 --> 0:1:25,33
to congratulate the people of Jordan on their
January 23rd parliamentary elections. We view


14
0:1:25,33 --> 0:1:30,76
these elections as an important step in the
ongoing reform process initiated by King Abdullah


15
0:1:30,76 --> 0:1:38,1
II. We note that international election observers
found that the voting process saw an improvement


16
0:1:38,1 --> 0:1:43,34
over past elections and that the elections
were conducted in a transparent and credible


17
0:1:43,34 --> 0:1:50,14
manner. But they also offered recommendations
about continuing to improve Jordan's electoral


18
0:1:50,14 --> 0:1:51,63
process going forward.


19
0:1:51,63 --> 0:1:57,58
In particular, the observers praised the work
of the independent electoral commission which


20
0:1:57,58 --> 0:2:2,189
administered these elections for the first
time. We look forward to the Government and


21
0:2:2,189 --> 0:2:7,15
people of Jordan building on this milestone
and carrying out additional political and


22
0:2:7,15 --> 0:2:12,84
economic reforms for the benefit of all Jordanians.
Jordan is a vital strategic partner of the


23
0:2:12,84 --> 0:2:17,51
United States, and we will continue to support
Jordan's leadership and the Jordanian people


24
0:2:17,51 --> 0:2:18,88
in their reform process.


25
0:2:18,88 --> 0:2:21,34
Let's go to what's on your minds.


26
0:2:21,34 --> 0:2:26,3
QUESTION: One quick thing, Toria. Thanks so
much for your comments about Andy. Speaking


27
0:2:26,3 --> 0:2:33,17
for myself, but I suspect also for my colleagues
here and at Reuters, he really is an unusually


28
0:2:33,17 --> 0:2:38,92
elegant writer and a decent and thoroughly
good-hearted man, and a very wry - with a


29
0:2:38,92 --> 0:2:40,89
very wry and gentle wit. And I will miss him.


30
0:2:40,89 --> 0:2:45,45
Maybe we can go to substance, now that we've
--


31
0:2:45,45 --> 0:2:50,63
QUESTION: (Inaudible) say is that we're going
to miss Andy, I guess.


32
0:2:50,63 --> 0:2:56,53
QUESTION: North Korea threatening to go to
war with the South?


33
0:2:56,53 --> 0:3:5,41
MS. NULAND: As you know, my colleague Jay
Carney spoke to these issues yesterday. These


34
0:3:5,41 --> 0:3:11,41
statements coming out in North Korea are needlessly
provocative. Any kind of further test would


35
0:3:11,41 --> 0:3:18,12
be another significant violation of UN Security
Council resolutions and only will serve to


36
0:3:18,12 --> 0:3:25,37
further Pyongyang's isolation. As you all
know, the UN Security Council passed Resolution


37
0:3:25,37 --> 0:3:34,94
2087 earlier in the week in response to the
December missile launch, and that resolution


38
0:3:34,94 --> 0:3:42,129
tightens the sanctions on North Korea and
works hard to ensure that it cannot succeed


39
0:3:42,129 --> 0:3:46,48
as a proliferator of missile technology, et
cetera.


40
0:3:46,48 --> 0:3:55,129
And it's just - it's really a pretty sad story
because the new North Korean leader has a


41
0:3:55,129 --> 0:4:0,64
choice to make, as the Secretary has said
so many times. He can serve to focus on the


42
0:4:0,64 --> 0:4:5,5
needs of his people, to bring his country
out of isolation and back into compliance


43
0:4:5,5 --> 0:4:11,86
with international obligations, open it back
up to the world, or he can continue to waste


44
0:4:11,86 --> 0:4:17,9
what little money the country has on missile
technologies and things while his people go


45
0:4:17,9 --> 0:4:18,669
hungry. So --


46
0:4:18,669 --> 0:4:24,13
QUESTION: I have a question on that. The new
leader is not all that new. I mean, you have


47
0:4:24,13 --> 0:4:33,3
a pattern of events that you can look at - the
original failed test, the subsequent missile


48
0:4:33,3 --> 0:4:42,22
test that was successful, and now the threat
to conduct a third nuclear test. Does it seem


49
0:4:42,22 --> 0:4:51,22
to you all now that he has made his choice
and how - what kind of a strategy, a diplomatic


50
0:4:51,22 --> 0:4:58,76
strategy, can you pursue if he is not interested
in serious talks about his nuclear and ballistic


51
0:4:58,76 --> 0:4:59,68
missile programs?


52
0:4:59,68 --> 0:5:4,3
MS. NULAND: Well, you're not wrong that the
pattern of choices is concerning, which is


53
0:5:4,3 --> 0:5:10,77
why we felt very strongly that the international
community - oh, we seem to have some guests.


54
0:5:10,77 --> 0:5:19,75
Hi, guys. Not sure who they were, but I think
they were lost.


55
0:5:19,75 --> 0:5:25,55
So again, the pattern of choices appears to
be quite concerning. That's why it's been


56
0:5:25,55 --> 0:5:33,18
so important to keep the international community
united in response to these negative choices,


57
0:5:33,18 --> 0:5:40,82
why we took the time we did to get it right
with Resolution 2087, to make clear to North


58
0:5:40,82 --> 0:5:48,16
Korea that particularly the Six-Party states,
including all of North Korea's neighbors,


59
0:5:48,16 --> 0:5:55,21
are united in ensuring that there is a price
to say, that there will be increasing sanctions,


60
0:5:55,21 --> 0:5:59,66
that we are going to be vigilant about their
proliferation activity, the activities of


61
0:5:59,66 --> 0:6:3,169
their banks, and that it's going to take the
country in the wrong direction.


62
0:6:3,169 --> 0:6:9,97
I think you know that Ambassador Glyn Davies
is out in the region now. He is in Beijing


63
0:6:9,97 --> 0:6:16,68
today, had very productive and useful meetings
with counterparts there, including Vice Foreign


64
0:6:16,68 --> 0:6:22,19
Minister Fu Ying, his counterpart Special
Representative for Korean Peninsula Affairs


65
0:6:22,19 --> 0:6:30,1
Wu Dawei, and others. He was in Seoul yesterday
and he's going on to Tokyo tomorrow. So very


66
0:6:30,1 --> 0:6:38,22
much a project to stay coordinated with our
Six-Party counterparts in watching this and


67
0:6:38,22 --> 0:6:43,52
in ensuring that North Korea gets the message
that nothing good is going to come from this.


68
0:6:43,52 --> 0:6:51,539
QUESTION: And turn back to the China issue
in this whole mix. Today, the Chinese press


69
0:6:51,539 --> 0:6:56,8
seemed to be suggesting that they've told
North Korea that if it goes ahead with its


70
0:6:56,8 --> 0:7:2,6
nuclear test that they will actually - Beijing
could cut its aid to Pyongyang. That seems


71
0:7:2,6 --> 0:7:7,35
to be an interesting move on the part of the
Chinese. What would you have to say on that?


72
0:7:7,35 --> 0:7:13,4
MS. NULAND: Well, I didn't see those particular
comments. But we have, as you know, regularly


73
0:7:13,4 --> 0:7:19,91
encouraged Beijing to use the significant
influence that it has with Pyongyang. They


74
0:7:19,91 --> 0:7:28,1
have, at various times, been able to make
clear that the continued support of Beijing


75
0:7:28,1 --> 0:7:35,81
in terms of trade, aid, the energy relationship,
et cetera, depends on North Korea making the


76
0:7:35,81 --> 0:7:43,19
right choices. Again, China joins strongly
with us in Resolution 2087, which was important,


77
0:7:43,19 --> 0:7:47,59
and we, as Glyn Davies said - he had a very
good visit to Beijing in terms of plotting


78
0:7:47,59 --> 0:7:48,759
the course forward together.


79
0:7:48,759 --> 0:7:52,11
QUESTION: How important - if they go ahead
and do something like that - how important


80
0:7:52,11 --> 0:7:58,3
could such a cut in Chinese aid to North Korea
be in changing the calculations of the North


81
0:7:58,3 --> 0:7:58,77
Korean leadership?


82
0:7:58,77 --> 0:8:4,91
MS. NULAND: Well, I don't want to speculate
on scenarios to be determined. But obviously,


83
0:8:4,91 --> 0:8:8,94
North Korea remains quite dependent on its
aid and trade relationship with Beijing.


84
0:8:8,94 --> 0:8:8,94
Jill, still on this?


85
0:8:8,94 --> 0:8:13,0
QUESTION: Toria, are the Six-Party Talks off,
as they seem to be indicating in the North


86
0:8:13,0 --> 0:8:14,139
Korean statement?


87
0:8:14,139 --> 0:8:21,789
MS. NULAND: Well, we've made clear for more
than a year now that the Six-Party Talks couldn't


88
0:8:21,789 --> 0:8:28,99
go forward to a new round unless we saw real
evidence that the DPRK was prepared to meet


89
0:8:28,99 --> 0:8:33,519
its obligations. So we're still in the state
that we've been for more than a year in terms


90
0:8:33,519 --> 0:8:36,679
of not having the kind of intent that we need
to go forward.


91
0:8:36,679 --> 0:8:37,809
QUESTION: New topic?


92
0:8:37,809 --> 0:8:39,209
MS. NULAND: Still on North Korea?


93
0:8:39,209 --> 0:8:39,759
QUESTION: Still on North Korea.


94
0:8:39,759 --> 0:8:40,319
MS. NULAND: Yeah. Please, here.


95
0:8:40,319 --> 0:8:44,759
QUESTION: Do you - this time around, do you
have any reason to believe the North Koreans


96
0:8:44,759 --> 0:8:50,129
will get that message and actually take astep
on - well, make the - what you would call


97
0:8:50,129 --> 0:8:55,589
the right choice and actually open up to dialogue,
or perhaps discontinue their programs or even


98
0:8:55,589 --> 0:8:57,129
do anything in the right direction?


99
0:8:57,129 --> 0:9:2,199
MS. NULAND: Well, anybody who endeavored to
be predictive about North Korean behavior


100
0:9:2,199 --> 0:9:8,649
is probably foolish. But what's been important
to us is strong unity among the Six-Party


101
0:9:8,649 --> 0:9:14,19
Talks countries, strong unity in the region
about a positive course forward, and the fact


102
0:9:14,19 --> 0:9:16,929
that there will be consequences if they keep
making bad choices.


103
0:9:16,929 --> 0:9:18,73
QUESTION: One more?


104
0:9:18,73 --> 0:9:20,519
MS. NULAND: Yeah.


105
0:9:20,519 --> 0:9:23,509
QUESTION: What types of consequences?


106
0:9:23,509 --> 0:9:24,73
MS. NULAND: Well, I think --


107
0:9:24,73 --> 0:9:27,269
QUESTION: Because there's been few besides
UN resolutions that haven't changed their


108
0:9:27,269 --> 0:9:29,17
behavior. There hasn't really been any significant
consequences otherwise.


109
0:9:29,17 --> 0:9:36,279
MS. NULAND: I would reject that, Brad. If
you look at UN Security Council that was just


110
0:9:36,279 --> 0:9:43,319
passed, 2087, and go through it, and I would
commend to you the fact sheet that USUN put


111
0:9:43,319 --> 0:9:49,35
out on this, it imposes new sanctions on North
Korean companies and government agencies,


112
0:9:49,35 --> 0:9:54,189
including a broad range of sanctions against
their space agency, which was responsible


113
0:9:54,189 --> 0:9:59,209
for the launch, as well as the Bank of East
Land and several individuals in the North


114
0:9:59,209 --> 0:10:4,329
Korean system who had previously not been
sanctioned. Six entities and four individuals


115
0:10:4,329 --> 0:10:10,29
will have their assets frozen and will be
prohibited from engaging in financial transactions.


116
0:10:10,29 --> 0:10:15,179
This is UN sanctions, not just U.S. sanctions.
There's an updated list of nuclear and ballistic


117
0:10:15,179 --> 0:10:20,119
missile technology that's going to be banned
from transfer to or from the DPRK. I could


118
0:10:20,119 --> 0:10:20,639
continue. But --


119
0:10:20,639 --> 0:10:25,389
QUESTION: Do you think there's space to squeeze
them further on the sanctions route, that


120
0:10:25,389 --> 0:10:30,509
this country which is perhaps the most heavily
sanctioned in the world can still be - there's


121
0:10:30,509 --> 0:10:33,809
still consequences along this sanctions route
left?


122
0:10:33,809 --> 0:10:37,199
MS. NULAND: Well, obviously, and we wouldn't
have put new sanctions on them if we didn't


123
0:10:37,199 --> 0:10:38,339
think that they would be effective.


124
0:10:38,339 --> 0:10:38,529
Please.


125
0:10:38,529 --> 0:10:41,899
QUESTION: I just wanted to follow up quickly
as far as North Korea's missile technology


126
0:10:41,899 --> 0:10:48,679
or missiles are concerned. Despite UN Security
Council resolutions or UN sanctions, international


127
0:10:48,679 --> 0:10:53,29
sanctions, still North Korea is continuing
and not listening to the international community.


128
0:10:53,29 --> 0:10:59,16
So if China is with you, Madam, since China
was always helping North Korea. But who else


129
0:10:59,16 --> 0:11:2,61
is behind this technology or behind North
Korea?


130
0:11:2,61 --> 0:11:8,799
MS. NULAND: Well, again, I think what we just
have been through here is the fact that the


131
0:11:8,799 --> 0:11:13,66
international community now with this new
resolution has spoken with one voice in putting


132
0:11:13,66 --> 0:11:20,519
on increasingly tough sanctions on the DPRK,
including getting at the space agency, getting


133
0:11:20,519 --> 0:11:27,66
at the banks, naming individuals who had not
previously been named, as contributing to


134
0:11:27,66 --> 0:11:32,449
taking the country in the wrong direction.
And we will continue to look for further opportunities


135
0:11:32,449 --> 0:11:38,579
to make our views clear in this kind of a
way if the DPRK doesn't change course.


136
0:11:38,579 --> 0:11:42,91
QUESTION: And when this new leader came in
North Korea, everybody hoped that things will


137
0:11:42,91 --> 0:11:48,4
change to the right direction for the people
of North Korea, but still they are going in


138
0:11:48,4 --> 0:11:50,35
the worst direction as far as the people are
concerned.


139
0:11:50,35 --> 0:11:55,839
MS. NULAND: Well, again, we would certainly
agree with that. I mean, as you know, we were


140
0:11:55,839 --> 0:12:2,649
a year ago engaged in trying to work out some
kind of a food assistance deal, but we didn't


141
0:12:2,649 --> 0:12:7,239
get the kind of assurance that we needed from
the government that it was going to go to


142
0:12:7,239 --> 0:12:9,309
the right place. So it's very disappointing.


143
0:12:9,309 --> 0:12:9,54
Please.


144
0:12:9,54 --> 0:12:10,22
QUESTION: Thank you.


145
0:12:10,22 --> 0:12:18,959
QUESTION: Does the United States have any
separate plan for additional sanctions toward


146
0:12:18,959 --> 0:12:23,259
North Korea for the third nuclear test?


147
0:12:23,259 --> 0:12:28,689
MS. NULAND: In response to the December test,
what you will see and what you've seen in


148
0:12:28,689 --> 0:12:36,279
the last couple of days are U.S. decisions
that implement the larger UN Security Council


149
0:12:36,279 --> 0:12:46,9
decisions in 2087. So you're starting to see
us put out our own sanctioning information


150
0:12:46,9 --> 0:12:50,589
to ensure that we are complying now in our
own law with 2087.


151
0:12:50,589 --> 0:12:51,49
Said.


152
0:12:51,49 --> 0:12:53,319
QUESTION: Can we change topics?


153
0:12:53,319 --> 0:12:54,689
MS. NULAND: Yes.


154
0:12:54,689 --> 0:12:56,509
QUESTION: The Israeli elections?


155
0:12:56,509 --> 0:12:57,4
MS. NULAND: Yeah.


156
0:12:57,4 --> 0:13:0,629
QUESTION: Okay. I wonder if you have a reaction
to the outcome of the election, the election


157
0:13:0,629 --> 0:13:4,679
result, and how is that likely to impact the
peace process?


158
0:13:4,679 --> 0:13:10,209
MS. NULAND: Well, I think we said, whether
it was - I guess it was on Tuesday before


159
0:13:10,209 --> 0:13:17,569
the election or on election day that Israel
has a vibrant democracy. We are at the stage


160
0:13:17,569 --> 0:13:23,389
now, as you know, where we're going to have
to wait and see what the makeup of the Israeli


161
0:13:23,389 --> 0:13:29,829
Government is going to be and how it approaches
the longstanding critical issues that we share.


162
0:13:29,829 --> 0:13:34,679
But we've been absolutely clear that as soon
as the parties are ready, we want to make


163
0:13:34,679 --> 0:13:37,69
a renewed push to try to get them back to
the table.


164
0:13:37,69 --> 0:13:43,449
QUESTION: Do you believe that the new coalition
is likely to be more inclined towards some


165
0:13:43,449 --> 0:13:45,329
sort of a peace resolution?


166
0:13:45,329 --> 0:13:49,35
MS. NULAND: The new coalition which hasn't
yet been decided and announced?


167
0:13:49,35 --> 0:13:53,899
QUESTION: I mean, there is - okay, let me
rephrase that. Do you expect the new coalition


168
0:13:53,899 --> 0:13:57,309
to be more engaged in the peace process than
the former one?


169
0:13:57,309 --> 0:14:1,609
MS. NULAND: I think we're not going to be
evaluating a coalition that's still trying


170
0:14:1,609 --> 0:14:2,439
to come together, Said.


171
0:14:2,439 --> 0:14:4,73
QUESTION: Okay. Let me just - let's follow
up with another point.


172
0:14:4,73 --> 0:14:5,35
MS. NULAND: Yeah.


173
0:14:5,35 --> 0:14:11,79
QUESTION: I asked a former U.S. ambassador
to Israel yesterday what is the overriding


174
0:14:11,79 --> 0:14:18,47
message of this Israeli election, and he said
that the message to the Palestinians is that


175
0:14:18,47 --> 0:14:21,769
you are not on our radar screen. Do you see
that as the case?


176
0:14:21,769 --> 0:14:28,4
MS. NULAND: I don't think we've had any indication
from Israel that that is the case. As you


177
0:14:28,4 --> 0:14:32,369
know, before these elections there was - there
were - there have been public statements from


178
0:14:32,369 --> 0:14:36,399
both Israelis and Palestinians that they want
to try to get back to the table. And we're


179
0:14:36,399 --> 0:14:37,829
going to try to work on those as soon as we
can.


180
0:14:37,829 --> 0:14:45,199
QUESTION: Can I ask you, did you find it reassuring
that centrist movement performed better than


181
0:14:45,199 --> 0:14:51,489
expected and that parties that seem to be
more hostile to the two-state peace solution


182
0:14:51,489 --> 0:14:54,129
performed worse than had been prognosticated?


183
0:14:54,129 --> 0:14:59,119
MS. NULAND: Again, I think the wonderful thing
about democracy is that the people get to


184
0:14:59,119 --> 0:15:4,41
speak, then politicians have to take the lessons
from that and move forward. In the case of


185
0:15:4,41 --> 0:15:7,959
a system like Israel, they've got to form
a government, and we're not going to prejudge


186
0:15:7,959 --> 0:15:11,73
how the Israeli - those elected --


187
0:15:11,73 --> 0:15:15,609
QUESTION: I'm not asking about the coalition.
I'm just talking about what the Israeli people


188
0:15:15,609 --> 0:15:20,859
chose, what they voted for. Do you find that
reassuring that they voted primarily for parties


189
0:15:20,859 --> 0:15:27,29
that agree or in broad brushstrokes agree
with the principles you've espoused?


190
0:15:27,29 --> 0:15:32,709
MS. NULAND: I think what we find reassuring
is that Israel continues to be a democratic


191
0:15:32,709 --> 0:15:38,47
beacon out there in the world and to have
a very vibrant system and process for ensuring


192
0:15:38,47 --> 0:15:42,549
that the people's voices are heard in the
political process. But how that's going to


193
0:15:42,549 --> 0:15:46,589
translate in terms of either government formation
or government policy is to be determined.


194
0:15:46,589 --> 0:15:48,22
QUESTION: All right. But I'm asking you specifically
about the peace process --


195
0:15:48,22 --> 0:15:50,85
MS. NULAND: I understand, Brad, and I don't
think --


196
0:15:50,85 --> 0:15:55,999
QUESTION: -- and there was a wide range of
views regarding the - how peace should be


197
0:15:55,999 --> 0:16:0,509
pursued or not pursued or however. And do
you find it reassuring that parties that seem


198
0:16:0,509 --> 0:16:8,609
- that want peace and that have publicly called
for a two-state peace solution, according


199
0:16:8,609 --> 0:16:13,629
to the principles you've outlined, are in
the driver's seat?


200
0:16:13,629 --> 0:16:17,639
MS. NULAND: Again, you can ask this question
however many ways you want, Brad. I'm not


201
0:16:17,639 --> 0:16:24,299
going to comment or opine or speculate as
to how the election results are going to --


202
0:16:24,299 --> 0:16:25,49
QUESTION: Speculation? It's just not even
a speculation question.


203
0:16:25,49 --> 0:16:29,329
MS. NULAND: Will you let me finish? How the
election results are going to translate into


204
0:16:29,329 --> 0:16:34,229
either coalition formulation or the policies
of the government, which are what will matter,


205
0:16:34,229 --> 0:16:37,629
obviously, until the Israelis have had a chance
to make those decisions.


206
0:16:37,629 --> 0:16:41,89
QUESTION: (Inaudible) a renewed push on that.
You're ready to make a - the Administration


207
0:16:41,89 --> 0:16:47,389
is ready to make a renewed push in the region
for peace. Have you ideas on how to set that


208
0:16:47,389 --> 0:16:49,689
forward, where we talk about direct talks
between the two sides, are we talking about


209
0:16:49,689 --> 0:16:53,359
another exchange of letters? What would it
consist of it?


210
0:16:53,359 --> 0:16:59,639
MS. NULAND: Well, we've always favored getting
the parties to direct talks, to a table together,


211
0:16:59,639 --> 0:17:4,679
as quickly as we can. So we will continue
to talk to both sides about what makes most


212
0:17:4,679 --> 0:17:6,669
sense and how quickly we can move.


213
0:17:6,669 --> 0:17:10,549
QUESTION: Because I think there might have
to be some kind of guarantees on both sides.


214
0:17:10,549 --> 0:17:14,99
I mean, obviously the Palestinians have long
asked for the settlement building to be halted,


215
0:17:14,99 --> 0:17:22,439
and that would bring them back to the table.
And on the Israeli side, there are also obviously


216
0:17:22,439 --> 0:17:27,5
similar conditions that they'd like to lay
down. Do you see some kind of the United States


217
0:17:27,5 --> 0:17:31,44
facilitating some kind of conditions? How
would it - how would it work?


218
0:17:31,44 --> 0:17:36,509
MS. NULAND: Well, for decades, as you know,
we have endeavored to facilitate this process


219
0:17:36,509 --> 0:17:41,62
however appears best based on where the parties
are at the time. But I think again, at the


220
0:17:41,62 --> 0:17:47,8
stage that we're at, which is three days after
an Israeli election and before a new government


221
0:17:47,8 --> 0:17:50,88
is formed and we've had a chance to talk to
them about policies going forward, I'm certainly


222
0:17:50,88 --> 0:17:55,929
not going to speculate on the how. We know
where we want to go and we know where we believe


223
0:17:55,929 --> 0:18:0,169
they also want to go. If we can be helpful,
we will continue to try.


224
0:18:0,169 --> 0:18:1,29
Jill.


225
0:18:1,29 --> 0:18:2,75
QUESTION: Syria?


226
0:18:2,75 --> 0:18:3,399
MS. NULAND: Yeah.


227
0:18:3,399 --> 0:18:6,7
QUESTION: Before we go on to Syria, I have
one more question. What steps should the Palestinians


228
0:18:6,7 --> 0:18:12,33
take as a result of this election right now?
What kind of thing do you urge them to do


229
0:18:12,33 --> 0:18:12,72
immediately?


230
0:18:12,72 --> 0:18:18,539
MS. NULAND: I'm not going to be, from this
podium here, giving advice to one side or


231
0:18:18,539 --> 0:18:23,95
the other. You know the general principles
that we're speaking of here in terms of undergirding


232
0:18:23,95 --> 0:18:29,34
an environment for peace. I think we've spoken
both in the Israeli context and in the Palestinian


233
0:18:29,34 --> 0:18:35,11
context about avoiding unilateral actions
that could undercut the environment for peace.


234
0:18:35,11 --> 0:18:41,39
That's still our message for both sides as
we get to a place where we've got interlocutors


235
0:18:41,39 --> 0:18:42,12
who are ready to talk.


236
0:18:42,12 --> 0:18:48,529
QUESTION: And finally, I know the Secretary
has been very busy, but did she call Mr. Netanyahu


237
0:18:48,529 --> 0:18:48,919
personally to congratulate him?


238
0:18:48,919 --> 0:18:54,38
MS. NULAND: To my knowledge, she has not made
any calls out to Israel at this stage.


239
0:18:54,38 --> 0:19:0,179
QUESTION: On Syria, there was a bit of confusion
yesterday about the former spokesman either


240
0:19:0,179 --> 0:19:4,5
being in the United States, somebody - the
U.S. wanting to give him the visa, et cetera.


241
0:19:4,5 --> 0:19:6,58
Can you set the record straight, please?


242
0:19:6,58 --> 0:19:13,39
MS. NULAND: I can. Mr. Makdisi is not in the
United States. Ambassador Ford misspoke. He


243
0:19:13,39 --> 0:19:13,529
is not here.


244
0:19:13,529 --> 0:19:15,2
QUESTION: Is there any intent to bring him
here?


245
0:19:15,2 --> 0:19:18,58
MS. NULAND: I don't have anything for you
on that. I don't - I also don't have anything


246
0:19:18,58 --> 0:19:20,649
for you on where he actually is.


247
0:19:20,649 --> 0:19:25,909
QUESTION: Do you have anything on where Assad's
mother may be?


248
0:19:25,909 --> 0:19:28,289
MS. NULAND: I do not.


249
0:19:28,289 --> 0:19:31,549
QUESTION: So there was a statement attributed
to Ambassador Ford suggesting that Assad's


250
0:19:31,549 --> 0:19:34,88
mother was in the Gulf region. Is that wrong?


251
0:19:34,88 --> 0:19:40,539
MS. NULAND: Again, on that one, I'll leave
Ambassador Ford's comments where they were.


252
0:19:40,539 --> 0:19:41,99
QUESTION: But you have no reason to doubt
them?


253
0:19:41,99 --> 0:19:42,799
MS. NULAND: I don't.


254
0:19:42,799 --> 0:19:44,9
QUESTION: Thank you.


255
0:19:44,9 --> 0:19:51,0
QUESTION: Okay. And also rumors that Mr. Brahimi
is submitting a very bleak report on Tuesday,


256
0:19:51,0 --> 0:19:56,139
and thereafter he might turn in his resignation
that - because he's meeting a brick wall.


257
0:19:56,139 --> 0:19:58,29
Do you have any comment on that?


258
0:19:58,29 --> 0:20:2,1
MS. NULAND: Well, obviously, I think we need
to let Mr. Brahimi bring his report forward


259
0:20:2,1 --> 0:20:8,59
before we prejudge where it might go. We have,
as you know, tried very hard to be supportive


260
0:20:8,59 --> 0:20:18,73
of his efforts, to collaborate with him in
his work, to flesh out the transitional government


261
0:20:18,73 --> 0:20:24,22
idea, to work to bring the Russians in. But
we look forward to hearing what he thinks


262
0:20:24,22 --> 0:20:25,85
needs to be done now when he reports.


263
0:20:25,85 --> 0:20:30,19
QUESTION: Do you believe that his mission
and his effort has run its course?


264
0:20:30,19 --> 0:20:34,529
MS. NULAND: We have not had those indications
from him, but we await to hear what he has


265
0:20:34,529 --> 0:20:39,25
to say. We continue to believe that the role
that he is playing, the facilitation he's


266
0:20:39,25 --> 0:20:44,19
trying to do, can be useful in conjunction
with a lot of other things that we're also


267
0:20:44,19 --> 0:20:45,799
working on, as we've been clear about.


268
0:20:45,799 --> 0:20:49,809
QUESTION: And finally, in his testimony yesterday,
Senator Kerry said that we want to bring in


269
0:20:49,809 --> 0:20:56,39
the Russians on the Syria situation. In what
ways, what different ways would he do that


270
0:20:56,39 --> 0:21:1,549
other than what, let's say, Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton has done so far with the Russians?


271
0:21:1,549 --> 0:21:9,84
MS. NULAND: Well, Said, let me just say, and
let me say to everybody for the record, just


272
0:21:9,84 --> 0:21:17,48
to remind you how our democratic process works
here, as you all saw, Senator Kerry had a


273
0:21:17,48 --> 0:21:23,95
chance in his confirmation hearings yesterday
to have a really full exchange with the members


274
0:21:23,95 --> 0:21:28,21
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
on a huge range of issues, not just Syria


275
0:21:28,21 --> 0:21:35,72
but it was really a tour all the way around
the world. That is American democracy in action.


276
0:21:35,72 --> 0:21:42,98
We want to see his speedy confirmation. But
until we have the Senate's advice and consent,


277
0:21:42,98 --> 0:21:50,59
it would not be appropriate for me to speak
from this podium for him or to try to parse


278
0:21:50,59 --> 0:21:59,98
his words or speculate as to where a secretaryship
led by a Secretary Kerry will take us. He


279
0:21:59,98 --> 0:22:5,799
obviously spoke extremely eloquently for himself,
and I would commend the transcript to you.


280
0:22:5,799 --> 0:22:6,39
Please.


281
0:22:6,39 --> 0:22:6,779
QUESTION: New subject?


282
0:22:6,779 --> 0:22:8,49
MS. NULAND: Yeah.


283
0:22:8,49 --> 0:22:15,59
QUESTION: Follow up Syria? A U.S. delegation
has visited Jordan and Turkey. I don't know


284
0:22:15,59 --> 0:22:21,639
if they are still in the region. Is there
any readout or update? We have seen some photo


285
0:22:21,639 --> 0:22:27,149
ops. But I'm - what's your readout on those
visits?


286
0:22:27,149 --> 0:22:33,87
MS. NULAND: Well, you are right, Ilhan, that
we have a U.S. delegation comprised of our


287
0:22:33,87 --> 0:22:41,7
Assistant Secretary for Population, Refugees,
and Migration Anne Richard, USAID Assistant


288
0:22:41,7 --> 0:22:49,45
Administrator Nancy Lindborg, and Ambassador
Ford. They visited the Islahiyah refugee camp


289
0:22:49,45 --> 0:22:55,389
in Turkey yesterday. They also had a chance
yesterday to be in Ankara to meet with Turkish


290
0:22:55,389 --> 0:23:0,97
officials and some of the members of the Syrian
Opposition Coalition Assistance Coordination


291
0:23:0,97 --> 0:23:6,87
Unit. This is the unit that the SOC created
to try to work better with the international


292
0:23:6,87 --> 0:23:15,25
community both on humanitarian and on other
kinds of assistance to the Syrian people.


293
0:23:15,25 --> 0:23:21,129
Tomorrow, Assistant Secretary Richard and
Assistant Administrator Lindborg will go to


294
0:23:21,129 --> 0:23:28,5
Amman to continue their consultations on the
humanitarian situation. And Ambassador Ford


295
0:23:28,5 --> 0:23:33,639
is going to go to Paris to attend a meeting
on assistance to the Syrian opposition that


296
0:23:33,639 --> 0:23:39,25
the French Government is hosting. It's a - they're
calling it a partner support meeting on better


297
0:23:39,25 --> 0:23:45,159
targeting assistance. I think we'll have a
little bit of a announcement right after the


298
0:23:45,159 --> 0:23:51,389
briefing. One of the things that they are
announcing on this trip is an additional $10


299
0:23:51,389 --> 0:24:0,39
million from the United States, primarily
directed at getting flour into the north of


300
0:24:0,39 --> 0:24:5,49
Syria, into bakeries in Aleppo, where there's
a real crying need. And we'll have more on


301
0:24:5,49 --> 0:24:13,549
that for you later in the day. And then from
there, Ambassador Ford goes on to Kuwait for


302
0:24:13,549 --> 0:24:17,259
the humanitarian assistance meeting.


303
0:24:17,259 --> 0:24:24,86
QUESTION: In recent days, one of the Syrian
groups start petition. It's about this new


304
0:24:24,86 --> 0:24:34,559
program by the UN revised Humanitarian Assistance
Response Plan launched by the United Nations.


305
0:24:34,559 --> 0:24:46,19
And apparently it's about half a billion dollars,
about $519 million. This petition, it says


306
0:24:46,19 --> 0:24:52,62
that the plan states that it aims at supporting
the Government of Syria. So there's a partnership


307
0:24:52,62 --> 0:25:1,389
with the current Syrian Government to send
half a billion humanitarian assistance to


308
0:25:1,389 --> 0:25:9,12
Syrians. So there is this apparently the problem
that how this, the government is going to


309
0:25:9,12 --> 0:25:15,45
help Syrians while they keep bombing across
country.


310
0:25:15,45 --> 0:25:22,19
MS. NULAND: Well, I don't - I'm not sure what
you are looking at there, Ilhan, as your backdrop,


311
0:25:22,19 --> 0:25:31,35
but the humanitarian aid situation has been
difficult and complicated for a long time,


312
0:25:31,35 --> 0:25:40,39
as you know. UN agencies are required to work
with the host government in order to get access


313
0:25:40,39 --> 0:25:47,73
in the country. And so the UN doesn't have
any choice but to continue to pound on the


314
0:25:47,73 --> 0:25:53,49
Syrian regime to let them get into the most
difficult areas. And you know that this is


315
0:25:53,49 --> 0:26:2,7
not a new problem, particularly when the regime
is conducting military operations. And we've


316
0:26:2,7 --> 0:26:7,669
seen this for more than a year, whether you're
talking about Homs or Hama or Aleppo or Damascus.


317
0:26:7,669 --> 0:26:14,94
So that is one of the constraints. And as
we look - as we work with UN agencies, we


318
0:26:14,94 --> 0:26:23,9
are continually urging them to find new and
different ways to get assistance into Syria.


319
0:26:23,9 --> 0:26:30,269
So that's one problem. But it also speaks
to the need to work with nongovernmental organizations


320
0:26:30,269 --> 0:26:35,999
and others who are in the border states who
are able to get assistance directly to Syrians


321
0:26:35,999 --> 0:26:40,19
who are going back and forth, because sometimes
they are able to get access to areas that


322
0:26:40,19 --> 0:26:41,34
the UN is not.


323
0:26:41,34 --> 0:26:46,96
QUESTION: I have a bunch of questions on that,
but I'm going to - not going to ask today.


324
0:26:46,96 --> 0:26:53,909
This apparently raises some questions. First
of all, the government doesn't have control


325
0:26:53,909 --> 0:26:59,96
of most of the country. And second, in the
past experiences, apparently there is a huge


326
0:26:59,96 --> 0:27:7,33
corruption. Even the humanitarian aid goes
only to places that the regime has control


327
0:27:7,33 --> 0:27:8,539
over.


328
0:27:8,539 --> 0:27:18,59
Yesterday, I believe, the president of Syrian
coalition said that they need $3 billion for


329
0:27:18,59 --> 0:27:26,999
a transitional government, to create transitional
government. Do you have a comment on that?


330
0:27:26,999 --> 0:27:32,299
Everybody pressures them to create this transitional
government, and they say they - we need $3


331
0:27:32,299 --> 0:27:34,289
billion to do that.


332
0:27:34,289 --> 0:27:40,46
MS. NULAND: I hadn't seen that number or those
comments either. However, we are in broad


333
0:27:40,46 --> 0:27:45,6
consultation with the Syrian Opposition Coalition,
including at this meeting that the French


334
0:27:45,6 --> 0:27:52,169
are going to host tomorrow, about moving forward
on transitional governing structures, about


335
0:27:52,169 --> 0:27:56,35
what the needs are going to be, and this is
one of the reasons to bring the major donor


336
0:27:56,35 --> 0:27:57,799
partners together with the SOC.


337
0:27:57,799 --> 0:27:58,72
QUESTION: Change of subject?


338
0:27:58,72 --> 0:27:59,409
MS. NULAND: Yeah.


339
0:27:59,409 --> 0:28:0,24
QUESTION: Can I --


340
0:28:0,24 --> 0:28:2,509
MS. NULAND: Still on Syria, Jill? No?


341
0:28:2,509 --> 0:28:7,549
QUESTION: The French also announced that there
is a meeting in Paris on the 28th (inaudible).


342
0:28:7,549 --> 0:28:9,749
Who's representing the United States in that
meeting?


343
0:28:9,749 --> 0:28:11,659
MS. NULAND: I think I just said Ambassador
Ford.


344
0:28:11,659 --> 0:28:12,769
QUESTION: Ambassador Ford - I'm sorry.


345
0:28:12,769 --> 0:28:15,659
QUESTION: Okay. On Russia, can you tell us
--


346
0:28:15,659 --> 0:28:16,71
MS. NULAND: Still - Scott on Syria.


347
0:28:16,71 --> 0:28:17,32
QUESTION: One on Syria, sorry.


348
0:28:17,32 --> 0:28:17,69
MS. NULAND: Yeah.


349
0:28:17,69 --> 0:28:23,35
QUESTION: Does contact between U.S. officials
and the Free Syrian Army include the issue


350
0:28:23,35 --> 0:28:27,8
of combat between FSA and Kurds?


351
0:28:27,8 --> 0:28:38,44
MS. NULAND: We are, in our contacts with the
FSA, expressing concern about including the


352
0:28:38,44 --> 0:28:49,74
Kurds in a broader opposition approach, that
when opposition groups are in conflict with


353
0:28:49,74 --> 0:28:57,879
each other, it doesn't help the broader cause
of a unified opposition to take the country


354
0:28:57,879 --> 0:29:5,139
in another - in a more democratic direction.
So one of our messages, both to the Kurds


355
0:29:5,139 --> 0:29:10,9
of Syria all the way through and to other
groups in Syria in the opposition, whether


356
0:29:10,9 --> 0:29:13,97
it's the FSA or whether it's the political
opposition, is that their cause is better


357
0:29:13,97 --> 0:29:20,789
served by unity and common cause. But we are
aware of some of these skirmishes that have


358
0:29:20,789 --> 0:29:24,24
been going on in the north, and we're concerned
about it.


359
0:29:24,24 --> 0:29:27,11
QUESTION: Can we - can I ask you about Russia?


360
0:29:27,11 --> 0:29:27,11
MS. NULAND: Yeah.


361
0:29:27,11 --> 0:29:31,44
QUESTION: Can you explain the U.S. decision
to end the Civil Society Working Group, a


362
0:29:31,44 --> 0:29:32,389
U.S.-Russian working group?


363
0:29:32,389 --> 0:29:49,899
MS. NULAND: As you know, this is a working
group that we set up a couple of years ago


364
0:29:49,899 --> 0:29:57,369
in the interest of exploring how we could
support civil society as a key underpinning


365
0:29:57,369 --> 0:30:5,34
of the U.S.-Russia relationship. We have now
decided to withdraw from the Civil Society


366
0:30:5,34 --> 0:30:10,59
Working Group of the U.S.-Russia Bilateral
Presidential Commission in light of recent


367
0:30:10,59 --> 0:30:16,45
steps taken by the Russian Government which
impose really strong restrictions on civil


368
0:30:16,45 --> 0:30:23,899
society. This working group was a bilateral
mechanism that was designed to foster the


369
0:30:23,899 --> 0:30:29,539
development of civil society, and the United
States will continue to work with Russian


370
0:30:29,539 --> 0:30:38,49
civil society organizations and to help them
in their efforts to support the Russian people


371
0:30:38,49 --> 0:30:43,159
and support their full human rights, their
access to healthcare, all of these other kinds


372
0:30:43,159 --> 0:30:50,6
of things. And we remain committed to a dialogue
with the Government of Russia on democracy


373
0:30:50,6 --> 0:30:55,289
issues and human rights issues, but this particular
working group was not working.


374
0:30:55,289 --> 0:31:3,19
QUESTION: Why is it not better to stay in
the working group and try to convince your


375
0:31:3,19 --> 0:31:11,22
interlocutors there either to try to reverse
some of the recent moves that you oppose or


376
0:31:11,22 --> 0:31:15,259
to do other things that would promote civil
society? I mean, did you just come to the


377
0:31:15,259 --> 0:31:17,48
conclusion that that was never going to happen
in this working group?


378
0:31:17,48 --> 0:31:22,499
MS. NULAND: Well, as I said, the working group
was not working. The new restrictions that


379
0:31:22,499 --> 0:31:27,33
the Government of Russia was placing on civil
society in recent months were increasingly


380
0:31:27,33 --> 0:31:32,69
calling into questions whether maintaining
this government-to-government mechanism was


381
0:31:32,69 --> 0:31:38,46
either useful or appropriate, and it was not
advancing the cause of civil society in Russia,


382
0:31:38,46 --> 0:31:40,129
so we will do that other ways.


383
0:31:40,129 --> 0:31:47,429
QUESTION: One other thing. Sorry. Just sticking
with Russia, I don't know if you are aware


384
0:31:47,429 --> 0:31:57,249
that the Duma today voted - I think it's 388
to 1 in favor a law that would criminalize


385
0:31:57,249 --> 0:32:8,649
what it describes as homosexual propaganda
and that would allow for - it would ban the


386
0:32:8,649 --> 0:32:16,519
promotion of gay events across Russia, and
it would allow fines of up to 500,000 rubles


387
0:32:16,519 --> 0:32:22,49
to be imposed on organizers of such events.
Do you have any comment on that specifically?


388
0:32:22,49 --> 0:32:26,69
MS. NULAND: Well, we are aware and we are
deeply concerned by this draft legislation


389
0:32:26,69 --> 0:32:32,95
in Russia that severely restricts freedom
of expression and assembly for lesbian, gay,


390
0:32:32,95 --> 0:32:38,7
bisexual, and transgender individuals and
indeed for all Russians. This is similar to


391
0:32:38,7 --> 0:32:43,71
legislation that already exists in St. Petersburg
that we have been expressing our concern about


392
0:32:43,71 --> 0:32:49,119
including in the Secretary's bilateral meetings
with Foreign Minister Lavrov for more than


393
0:32:49,119 --> 0:32:53,49
a year and in several other regions of Russia.


394
0:32:53,49 --> 0:32:58,45
We call on Russia as a signatory to the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to


395
0:32:58,45 --> 0:33:3,529
meet its obligations to protect its citizens'
rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of


396
0:33:3,529 --> 0:33:10,29
expression without discrimination. You know
how strongly we feel about LGBT rights around


397
0:33:10,29 --> 0:33:15,619
the world, how strongly the Secretary of State
personally feels, that nobody should be discriminated


398
0:33:15,619 --> 0:33:22,249
against for who they love. I would note that
Russian citizens are also concerned. I understand


399
0:33:22,249 --> 0:33:28,49
that there was a kiss-in outside the Duma
today to protest this legislation.


400
0:33:28,49 --> 0:33:35,57
QUESTION: So Toria, on that, in other words,
just getting back to that civil society group


401
0:33:35,57 --> 0:33:40,46
withdrawal, then we could - from that organization,
we can interpret as a protest by the United


402
0:33:40,46 --> 0:33:40,96
States?


403
0:33:40,96 --> 0:33:46,789
MS. NULAND: We formed the group in an effort
to have government support for the development


404
0:33:46,789 --> 0:33:52,21
of civil society. Our concern is that what
we're seeing from the Russian Government is


405
0:33:52,21 --> 0:33:59,19
taking the position of civil society in Russia
in the wrong direction. So we would rather


406
0:33:59,19 --> 0:34:5,379
direct our efforts in other ways and continue
to work on our direct support for civil society


407
0:34:5,379 --> 0:34:7,21
organizations who want to work with us.


408
0:34:7,21 --> 0:34:10,36
QUESTION: And yet direct support now is more
difficult than ever.


409
0:34:10,36 --> 0:34:11,2
MS. NULAND: Absolutely.


410
0:34:11,2 --> 0:34:13,569
QUESTION: So how do you propose to do that?


411
0:34:13,569 --> 0:34:18,53
MS. NULAND: Well, we do continue to work with
a broad cross-section of Russian civil society


412
0:34:18,53 --> 0:34:26,53
organizations. They obviously have to manage
to do that within their own law. I think you


413
0:34:26,53 --> 0:34:31,619
know that there are lots of countries where
we do this from the United States. We do it


414
0:34:31,619 --> 0:34:38,329
from offices in third countries. But as long
as there are Russian civil society activists


415
0:34:38,329 --> 0:34:43,599
who want our help, who want our support, who
want to connect with civil society organizations


416
0:34:43,599 --> 0:34:46,139
in the United States, we will help them.


417
0:34:46,139 --> 0:34:52,179
QUESTION: Can I just ask you, these working
groups were established as part of the reset,


418
0:34:52,179 --> 0:34:57,71
if I remember correctly. And if I remember
right, it was this notion that you'd work


419
0:34:57,71 --> 0:35:4,24
together where you can and talk through differences
where they exist. In this case, you're now


420
0:35:4,24 --> 0:35:11,349
not even going to talk about this central
difference of opinion on civil society. So


421
0:35:11,349 --> 0:35:14,89
what does that say about the reset three,
four years on?


422
0:35:14,89 --> 0:35:22,4
MS. NULAND: Well, let me say that we will
obviously continue to talk about human rights,


423
0:35:22,4 --> 0:35:28,4
we will continue to talk about civil society
issues, we will continue to talk about democracy


424
0:35:28,4 --> 0:35:33,95
in Russia in our bilateral conversations with
the Russians at every level from the President


425
0:35:33,95 --> 0:35:39,95
on down. That's a different matter than whether
it makes sense under the Bilateral Presidential


426
0:35:39,95 --> 0:35:48,52
Commission to have a working group when that
working group is not advancing the ball. So


427
0:35:48,52 --> 0:35:53,68
you'll remember that as part of the reset
we established this Presidential Commission


428
0:35:53,68 --> 0:36:0,17
with lots of different working groups on everything
from economy to health to nuclear things to


429
0:36:0,17 --> 0:36:6,47
many other issues that we work on together.
This particular subgroup is not doing what


430
0:36:6,47 --> 0:36:8,859
we set it out to do, and so we've withdrawn.


431
0:36:8,859 --> 0:36:12,799
QUESTION: So I suppose the question is: Are
the other groups working? Are the other working


432
0:36:12,799 --> 0:36:14,42
groups working on the different issues you
-


433
0:36:14,42 --> 0:36:17,819
MS. NULAND: Yeah, and in fact, I would - I
can't remember when we last - I think it was


434
0:36:17,819 --> 0:36:27,809
in the context of the President's meeting
in - on the margins of his Asia trip with


435
0:36:27,809 --> 0:36:33,5
President Putin that we released a joint statement
that went through the work of many of these


436
0:36:33,5 --> 0:36:36,48
working groups. I would commend that to you.
It was on the White House website.


437
0:36:36,48 --> 0:36:41,349
QUESTION: Do you see - because we've got this
now, you withdrawing from this group on civil


438
0:36:41,349 --> 0:36:50,16
society, there was the decision towards the
back end of last year to - by Moscow to kick


439
0:36:50,16 --> 0:36:57,339
out USAID. Are these just bumps in the road
of your relations with Russia, or is it indicative


440
0:36:57,339 --> 0:36:59,43
of something much more serious?


441
0:36:59,43 --> 0:37:7,9
MS. NULAND: Well, I think beyond saying what
we've been saying, which is that we will continue


442
0:37:7,9 --> 0:37:13,91
to work with Russia on as many areas as we
can where we see interest in cooperation,


443
0:37:13,91 --> 0:37:17,66
whether they are bilateral issues, whether
they are regional issues, or whether they


444
0:37:17,66 --> 0:37:23,39
are global issues, but we will also speak
straight when we have disagreements, as we


445
0:37:23,39 --> 0:37:27,2
have, whether it was on the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Georgia, whether


446
0:37:27,2 --> 0:37:33,319
it was on human rights, whether it was on
Syria. I don't think it makes sense to try


447
0:37:33,319 --> 0:37:37,52
to give that relationship a grade. It has
always been something that we've both had


448
0:37:37,52 --> 0:37:41,79
to work hard on, and I think we'll continue
to have to do so.


449
0:37:41,79 --> 0:37:41,77
Please.


450
0:37:41,77 --> 0:37:47,339
QUESTION: Speaking of USAID, some in Congress
now are questioning USAID, demanding information


451
0:37:47,339 --> 0:37:53,53
on this investigation into a contract that
apparently some would allege was steered toward


452
0:37:53,53 --> 0:38:2,599
a former USAID employee. What can you tell
us about that, the status of that right now?


453
0:38:2,599 --> 0:38:9,29
MS. NULAND: Well, let me first say that my
understanding is that this relates to an investigation


454
0:38:9,29 --> 0:38:17,53
that is still ongoing, so I am quite constrained
in what I can say in terms of discussing the


455
0:38:17,53 --> 0:38:24,299
details. What I will say is from this building,
we are confident that the investigation has


456
0:38:24,299 --> 0:38:30,67
not been compromised, and that USAID has cooperated
with the investigation. But I think we have


457
0:38:30,67 --> 0:38:32,2
to wait until it's completed.


458
0:38:32,2 --> 0:38:35,66
QUESTION: What do you mean you're confident
that the investigation has not been compromised?


459
0:38:35,66 --> 0:38:40,27
MS. NULAND: There were some concerns about
that, and I would just like to affirm here


460
0:38:40,27 --> 0:38:43,109
that it is our view that it has not been compromised.


461
0:38:43,109 --> 0:38:54,28
QUESTION: And are you confident that the employees
that - who are alleged to be under investigation,


462
0:38:54,28 --> 0:38:57,799
or are reported to be under investigation,
acted properly?


463
0:38:57,799 --> 0:39:2,25
MS. NULAND: I'm not in a position to make
that judgment in the middle of an investigation.


464
0:39:2,25 --> 0:39:3,589
That's why the investigation is ongoing.


465
0:39:3,589 --> 0:39:7,89
QUESTION: And when you - last thing - when
you refer to the investigation, you are indeed


466
0:39:7,89 --> 0:39:14,28
referring to the Justice Department investigation
into this, correct, not into an IG investigation


467
0:39:14,28 --> 0:39:15,93
or a congressional investigation?


468
0:39:15,93 --> 0:39:19,869
MS. NULAND: My understanding is we were talking
about an IG investigation. I don't know what


469
0:39:19,869 --> 0:39:20,89
else you would be talking about.


470
0:39:20,89 --> 0:39:25,96
QUESTION: The AP reported yesterday that the
Justice Department is conducting a criminal


471
0:39:25,96 --> 0:39:32,309
investigation into possible contract-rigging
by the general counsel at USAID.


472
0:39:32,309 --> 0:39:37,69
MS. NULAND: What I have pertains to an IG
investigation. If we have anything more on


473
0:39:37,69 --> 0:39:39,7
that or how they might link, I'll get back
to you.


474
0:39:39,7 --> 0:39:40,79
QUESTION: Victoria.


475
0:39:40,79 --> 0:39:40,64
MS. NULAND: Yeah.


476
0:39:40,64 --> 0:39:45,309
QUESTION: You said you didn't want to give
the relationship with Russia a grade. I mean,


477
0:39:45,309 --> 0:39:50,53
why not? How do you evaluate your relationship
with Russia? I mean, the President spoke of


478
0:39:50,53 --> 0:39:58,349
a reset policy, I think, at the time, provided
that Russia cooperates with you on a number


479
0:39:58,349 --> 0:40:3,4
of issues. So when do you know that the situation
or the relationship is so tense that you cannot


480
0:40:3,4 --> 0:40:3,71
cooperate?


481
0:40:3,71 --> 0:40:8,13
MS. NULAND: I don't think it's useful in any
context to be giving grades unless you're


482
0:40:8,13 --> 0:40:9,7
in high school or elementary school. I think
I have enough of that at home.


483
0:40:9,7 --> 0:40:15,25
QUESTION: No, I don't mean a grade, per se,
but how do you say - how do you put a status


484
0:40:15,25 --> 0:40:15,71
on that relationship?


485
0:40:15,71 --> 0:40:19,359
MS. NULAND: Said, I think I spoke to the general
principles that undergird the relationship.


486
0:40:19,359 --> 0:40:20,0
QUESTION: (Off-mike.)


487
0:40:20,0 --> 0:40:21,599
MS. NULAND: Yeah, go ahead.


488
0:40:21,599 --> 0:40:27,69
QUESTION: Firstly, we had a story a few days
ago on Saeed Abedini, this U.S. citizen jailed


489
0:40:27,69 --> 0:40:33,77
in Iran, reporting that he might get bail.
Do you have any information on that and on


490
0:40:33,77 --> 0:40:34,44
his status?


491
0:40:34,44 --> 0:40:39,339
MS. NULAND: We remain very concerned about
U.S. citizen Saeed Abedini, who is detained


492
0:40:39,339 --> 0:40:45,349
in Iran on charges related to his religious
beliefs. Mr. Abedini's attorney had only one


493
0:40:45,349 --> 0:40:50,52
day to present his defense. And we remain
deeply concerned about the fairness and the


494
0:40:50,52 --> 0:40:56,21
transparency of his trial. We condemn Iran's
continued violation of the universal rights


495
0:40:56,21 --> 0:41:1,28
of freedom of religion, and we call on the
Iranian authorities to respect Mr. Abedini's


496
0:41:1,28 --> 0:41:6,359
human rights and to release him. We are in
close contact with his family as well and


497
0:41:6,359 --> 0:41:8,89
we're actively engaged in the case.


498
0:41:8,89 --> 0:41:14,609
QUESTION: So no indication that he was let
out on bail as, I think it was, this Iranian


499
0:41:14,609 --> 0:41:16,43
news agency seemed to suggest that might be
--


500
0:41:16,43 --> 0:41:19,67
MS. NULAND: I don't have any positive news
to report on this, unfortunately.


501
0:41:19,67 --> 0:41:26,369
QUESTION: Okay. And then on another issue,
there's been some reports about a mysterious


502
0:41:26,369 --> 0:41:33,15
gold transfer that seemed to have made its
way from Ghana to Turkey, had a brief pause


503
0:41:33,15 --> 0:41:38,99
there, then to Dubai, and then to Iran. Do
you know anything about this, and do you know


504
0:41:38,99 --> 0:41:40,95
what it means?


505
0:41:40,95 --> 0:41:46,4
MS. NULAND: I don't appear to have much on
this other than to say that we continue to


506
0:41:46,4 --> 0:41:53,39
consult closely with Turkey and on all countries
regarding the scope of U.S. sanctions against


507
0:41:53,39 --> 0:41:59,27
Iran, and we will pursue any evidence of sanctionable
transactions. But I don't have anything on


508
0:41:59,27 --> 0:42:1,17
this particular set of alleged circumstances.


509
0:42:1,17 --> 0:42:4,96
QUESTION: You haven't had any discussions
with Turkey specifically on this?


510
0:42:4,96 --> 0:42:7,849
MS. NULAND: I don't have anything to share
on that one way or the other.


511
0:42:7,849 --> 0:42:8,27
QUESTION: Okay.


512
0:42:8,27 --> 0:42:9,52
QUESTION: Staying in the region, Iraq?


513
0:42:9,52 --> 0:42:10,14
MS. NULAND: Yeah.


514
0:42:10,14 --> 0:42:16,359
QUESTION: A very quick question: According
to reports, five protestors got killed today


515
0:42:16,359 --> 0:42:25,0
in Fallujah, Iraq. Have - are you able to
confirm - during protests by the Iraqi security


516
0:42:25,0 --> 0:42:25,26
forces.


517
0:42:25,26 --> 0:42:31,539
MS. NULAND: I'm not in a position to confirm
numbers, but I will say that we are concerned


518
0:42:31,539 --> 0:42:37,0
about the use of deadly force during today's
protests in Iraq. We understand that the Iraqi


519
0:42:37,0 --> 0:42:42,76
Government has now issued a statement indicating
that they are initiating a very prompt investigation


520
0:42:42,76 --> 0:42:47,89
into the incidents, and that they have called
for restraint by security forces. We obviously


521
0:42:47,89 --> 0:42:56,39
stand ready to assist in that investigation
if asked, but we would also say that as the


522
0:42:56,39 --> 0:43:0,48
government and government forces show restraint,
the demonstrators also have a responsibility


523
0:43:0,48 --> 0:43:6,45
to exercise their right to protest in a nonviolent
manner, as well as to continue to press their


524
0:43:6,45 --> 0:43:8,96
demands through the political process.


525
0:43:8,96 --> 0:43:10,51
QUESTION: On Mali?


526
0:43:10,51 --> 0:43:13,77
MS. NULAND: Please. Arshad.


527
0:43:13,77 --> 0:43:17,859
QUESTION: I have two (inaudible).


528
0:43:17,859 --> 0:43:18,28
MS. NULAND: Yeah.


529
0:43:18,28 --> 0:43:19,609
QUESTION: One is: We have a report saying
that P-5+1 talks with the Iranians that had


530
0:43:19,609 --> 0:43:28,599
hoped to be held next week are actually likely
now to slide into February. Do you have anything


531
0:43:28,599 --> 0:43:29,859
on that?


532
0:43:29,859 --> 0:43:35,859
MS. NULAND: Other than to say we are continuing
to consult with the Iranians to determine


533
0:43:35,859 --> 0:43:44,17
dates and a venue, unfortunately I don't.
We've been surprised that the Iranians keep


534
0:43:44,17 --> 0:43:48,809
coming back again and again with new preconditions,
new dates and venues. And we haven't been


535
0:43:48,809 --> 0:43:50,869
able to settle yet, but we're going to keep
trying.


536
0:43:50,869 --> 0:43:55,15
QUESTION: They've been coming back with substantive
preconditions or with date and venue-related


537
0:43:55,15 --> 0:43:55,559
preconditions?


538
0:43:55,559 --> 0:44:0,89
MS. NULAND: They've been coming back with
preconditions on the modalities for the talks.


539
0:44:0,89 --> 0:44:5,14
We're not to the point of substance yet; we're
still trying to figure out when and where.


540
0:44:5,14 --> 0:44:12,93
QUESTION: And then one other one: We have
reported that South Korean petrochemical company


541
0:44:12,93 --> 0:44:21,41
Samsung Total Petrochemicals has revived a
contract to buy Iranian oil after more than


542
0:44:21,41 --> 0:44:27,88
a year of not buying any. And it appears that
the reason they have done so is that they're


543
0:44:27,88 --> 0:44:34,4
getting the oil pretty cheaply. I realize
that the NDAA sanctions refer to purchases


544
0:44:34,4 --> 0:44:44,859
by a country as a whole and not individual
companies, but are you troubled by the - by


545
0:44:44,859 --> 0:44:49,14
this, by the prospect that one of our ally's
oil companies, after stopping buying Iranian


546
0:44:49,14 --> 0:44:52,299
oil, is now starting up again?


547
0:44:52,299 --> 0:44:58,49
MS. NULAND: Arshad, let me take that one because
I need to check on whether our facts and yours


548
0:44:58,49 --> 0:44:59,65
are the same and how we would react.


549
0:44:59,65 --> 0:44:59,95
Please.


550
0:44:59,95 --> 0:45:0,829
QUESTION: On Mali?


551
0:45:0,829 --> 0:45:2,1
MS. NULAND: Mali, yeah.


552
0:45:2,1 --> 0:45:7,52
QUESTION: There have been increasingly harsher
tones coming out of Paris both from the President,


553
0:45:7,52 --> 0:45:13,16
President Hollande, and the Defense Minister
with regard to the determination of the French


554
0:45:13,16 --> 0:45:18,94
of going further to clean up this situation
in Mali, whereas initially it was seen on


555
0:45:18,94 --> 0:45:24,41
the French side as a temporary operation by
French troops which would be replaced by these


556
0:45:24,41 --> 0:45:30,41
ECOWAS. The French were not so inclined to
get deeply involved in Francophone Africa


557
0:45:30,41 --> 0:45:36,49
for obvious reasons. They are treated like
heroes, people are putting out French flags,


558
0:45:36,49 --> 0:45:39,96
but that's not going to last forever if the
French remain a long time.


559
0:45:39,96 --> 0:45:45,66
Now, after the statements of Prime Minister
Cameron, the intervention, I think, of the


560
0:45:45,66 --> 0:45:49,329
EU is going to get involved in this. This
looks like it's going to be a much longer


561
0:45:49,329 --> 0:45:55,28
war and more serious operation. What is the
U.S. view of the situation as it's developing


562
0:45:55,28 --> 0:45:56,0
in Mali?


563
0:45:56,0 --> 0:46:2,42
MS. NULAND: Well, let me just commend to you
some of the comments that the Secretary made


564
0:46:2,42 --> 0:46:10,89
during her Benghazi hearings with regard to
the challenge that we are all having to confront,


565
0:46:10,89 --> 0:46:17,789
not only in Mali but in the entire region.
I think she obviously spoke quite eloquently


566
0:46:17,789 --> 0:46:22,68
about the challenge; that it's not only a
security challenge but it's also a challenge


567
0:46:22,68 --> 0:46:30,25
of governance and democracy and values. Our
understanding of the ground situation is that


568
0:46:30,25 --> 0:46:36,799
French and Malian forces have been able to
have some success in recent days. We talked


569
0:46:36,799 --> 0:46:43,2
about Diabali the other day and Kona. They
are now taking up positions in the city of


570
0:46:43,2 --> 0:46:49,9
Menaka, which is just to the east of Gao,
and moving up into Gao and Timbuktu.


571
0:46:49,9 --> 0:46:58,14
But you're not wrong that the strategy here
depends on both Malian and ECOWAS forces being


572
0:46:58,14 --> 0:47:5,99
able to come in behind, secure the gains,
not only hold them but extend them, and also


573
0:47:5,99 --> 0:47:12,18
prepare the country for a restoration of democracy
through elections this spring. So in that


574
0:47:12,18 --> 0:47:18,27
context, as you know, in addition to supporting
some of the French requests, we are focusing


575
0:47:18,27 --> 0:47:26,64
our efforts on facilitating the ECOWAS forces,
the AFISMA forces to get into Mali. Our understanding


576
0:47:26,64 --> 0:47:32,45
is that there are currently some 600 AFISMA
troops in Mali, including 44 African staff


577
0:47:32,45 --> 0:47:39,869
at ECOWAS headquarters. We've got 162 from
Nigeria, 50 from Benin, 204 from Togo, 36


578
0:47:39,869 --> 0:47:47,44
from Senegal, 159 from Burkina. And we have
some 500-plus Nigerian troops on the Niger


579
0:47:47,44 --> 0:47:50,42
border getting ready to go in.


580
0:47:50,42 --> 0:47:59,39
The U.S. is also, as we've been talking about,
using our ACOTA facility to work with Niger,


581
0:47:59,39 --> 0:48:5,88
Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Togo, Ghana
in the coming weeks to ensure that they can


582
0:48:5,88 --> 0:48:12,299
sustain and continue these deployments, and
with longer-term training in terms of what'll


583
0:48:12,299 --> 0:48:19,68
be necessary to not only come in behind the
French, but also to train and support the


584
0:48:19,68 --> 0:48:22,609
Malian forces in eventually being able to
secure their country themselves.


585
0:48:22,609 --> 0:48:25,49
QUESTION: Your what facility? You said our
--


586
0:48:25,49 --> 0:48:28,91
MS. NULAND: Our ACOTA facility, which we've
talked about before. I'll see if I've got


587
0:48:28,91 --> 0:48:33,74
it written out here - the African Contingency
Operations Training and Assistance program.


588
0:48:33,74 --> 0:48:38,29
I think I'm going to - we're going to put
out a fact sheet shortly on ACOTA. Yeah.


589
0:48:38,29 --> 0:48:42,13
QUESTION: There's a P missing from the acronym
at the end.


590
0:48:42,13 --> 0:48:42,7
MS. NULAND: Is there?


591
0:48:42,7 --> 0:48:42,96
QUESTION: Anyhow.


592
0:48:42,96 --> 0:48:45,96
MS. NULAND: African Contingency Operations
Training and Assistance, ACOTA.


593
0:48:45,96 --> 0:48:46,99
QUESTION: Okay.


594
0:48:46,99 --> 0:48:53,279
QUESTION: Staying - just moving slightly in
the region, on Algeria, has there been any


595
0:48:53,279 --> 0:48:59,279
contact since the end of the hostage crisis
between the Algerian authorities and the State


596
0:48:59,279 --> 0:49:6,95
Department to update you on how the attack
at the oil facility took place, and their


597
0:49:6,95 --> 0:49:12,42
subsequent - the subsequent decisions that
were made by the Algerian authorities in handling


598
0:49:12,42 --> 0:49:14,88
the situation and releasing the hostages?


599
0:49:14,88 --> 0:49:20,559
MS. NULAND: Well, we are, obviously, in close
contact with the Algerians, including via


600
0:49:20,559 --> 0:49:26,369
Ambassador Ensher on the ground there. I think
I mentioned that we have an open FBI investigation


601
0:49:26,369 --> 0:49:31,52
now, so I'm not going to get into details,
as that moves forward. But we, like the Algerians,


602
0:49:31,52 --> 0:49:37,599
are obviously looking to get a full understanding
of exactly how this transpired and what the


603
0:49:37,599 --> 0:49:40,49
motives were and who was involved so that
they can be brought to justice.


604
0:49:40,49 --> 0:49:42,89
QUESTION: So that understanding hasn't evolved
since we spoke on Tuesday?


605
0:49:42,89 --> 0:49:47,339
MS. NULAND: I don't have anything to share.
It certainly has evolved, but you understand


606
0:49:47,339 --> 0:49:50,98
that once these things become a matter of
investigation, there's very - not a lot we


607
0:49:50,98 --> 0:49:52,95
can say until the investigations are complete.


608
0:49:52,95 --> 0:49:54,89
QUESTION: New subject, ma'am?


609
0:49:54,89 --> 0:49:58,119
MS. NULAND: Goyal quickly, and then we'll
go to Scott, and poor old Dana that was way


610
0:49:58,119 --> 0:49:59,67
in the back and I missed her.


611
0:49:59,67 --> 0:50:0,2
Okay, go ahead.


612
0:50:0,2 --> 0:50:0,72
QUESTION: New subject?


613
0:50:0,72 --> 0:50:1,25
MS. NULAND: Yeah.


614
0:50:1,25 --> 0:50:6,72
QUESTION: My question is the Chicago courts
on India. As Indians celebrate the Republic


615
0:50:6,72 --> 0:50:13,319
Day of India tomorrow, and India is shocked
and Indians are very angry as far as the Chicago


616
0:50:13,319 --> 0:50:20,5
court's outcomes are concerned for Mr. Rana
last week, only 14 years, what they are saying,


617
0:50:20,5 --> 0:50:26,109
and now yesterday, 35 years for David Coleman
Headley.


618
0:50:26,109 --> 0:50:36,13
Now, what they are saying is this is the price
of - cost of the 166 people killed in Mumbai


619
0:50:36,13 --> 0:50:43,21
attacks, and including six Americans. And
what Indians are really saying, that why this


620
0:50:43,21 --> 0:50:50,339
has happened - only 35 years, but why he was
not extradited to India to face justice, because


621
0:50:50,339 --> 0:50:58,619
U.S. and India both believes in - that anyone
who - criminals must face justice?


622
0:50:58,619 --> 0:51:5,91
MS. NULAND: Let me just underscore what the
Justice Department announced when this trial


623
0:51:5,91 --> 0:51:12,79
completed - it was completed. David Headley,
a key conspirator in the Mumbai terrorist


624
0:51:12,79 --> 0:51:18,789
attacks, has been brought to justice in the
United States. He will serve 35 years in prison


625
0:51:18,789 --> 0:51:24,9
for his role in these heinous acts that claimed
the lives of 166 people, including six Americans.


626
0:51:24,9 --> 0:51:33,46
He also gave - the investigation and the prosecution
of David Headley stems from the unprecedented


627
0:51:33,46 --> 0:51:40,13
and intense collaboration between the United
States and Indian authorities in the counterterrorism


628
0:51:40,13 --> 0:51:45,5
sphere to bring all the people responsible
for Mumbai to justice.


629
0:51:45,5 --> 0:51:52,46
Let me just add, and I would commend to you
the fact sheet put out by our Embassy in Delhi


630
0:51:52,46 --> 0:51:58,589
and the comments made by the Justice Department
yesterday, not only did he stand trial, face


631
0:51:58,589 --> 0:52:3,91
conviction, now have to serve 35 years. But
in the context of this prosecution, Mr. Headley


632
0:52:3,91 --> 0:52:9,99
provided information of substantial value
in our efforts against terrorism, including


633
0:52:9,99 --> 0:52:18,79
testifying against co-conspirator Mr. Rana,
providing extensive detail about accused terrorist


634
0:52:18,79 --> 0:52:24,94
Kashmiri and his network, who was indicted
in 2009, as you know, and as well as submitting


635
0:52:24,94 --> 0:52:29,589
to questions from Indian law enforcement and
working with U.S. investigators.


636
0:52:29,589 --> 0:52:35,79
So from our perspective, justice was served,
and this is a very positive example of U.S.-Indian


637
0:52:35,79 --> 0:52:37,299
collaboration in the counterterrorism realm.


638
0:52:37,299 --> 0:52:41,529
QUESTION: Madam, what message would be from
the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to


639
0:52:41,529 --> 0:52:47,52
the people, or the victims of 166 people and
their loved ones, and including six Americans


640
0:52:47,52 --> 0:52:48,279
on this day?


641
0:52:48,279 --> 0:52:52,789
MS. NULAND: That we promised that justice
would be served, that justice is being served


642
0:52:52,789 --> 0:52:53,849
in this case.


643
0:52:53,849 --> 0:52:55,0
Please, Scott.


644
0:52:55,0 --> 0:52:56,96
QUESTION: On the same subject --


645
0:52:56,96 --> 0:52:59,65
MS. NULAND: Scott. Yeah, sorry. Go ahead.


646
0:52:59,65 --> 0:53:3,15
QUESTION: So the two ministers, Indian ministers,
expressed concern that they wanted to keep


647
0:53:3,15 --> 0:53:10,73
up the effort to extradite him. Are you continuing
to that dialogue, or is this just a matter


648
0:53:10,73 --> 0:53:15,619
of - because of the U.S. legal system, this
is a closed, locked door that they're banging


649
0:53:15,619 --> 0:53:16,2
at?


650
0:53:16,2 --> 0:53:19,619
MS. NULAND: The Justice Department spoke to
this. He's been tried, convicted, and will


651
0:53:19,619 --> 0:53:20,51
serve in the United States.


652
0:53:20,51 --> 0:53:20,71
Scott?


653
0:53:20,71 --> 0:53:21,51
QUESTION: Well, just quickly --


654
0:53:21,51 --> 0:53:23,99
MS. NULAND: Scott - I think we're - I think
we've done this one.


655
0:53:23,99 --> 0:53:23,2
Scott?


656
0:53:23,2 --> 0:53:23,38
QUESTION: Azerbaijan.


657
0:53:23,38 --> 0:53:23,66
MS. NULAND: Yeah.


658
0:53:23,66 --> 0:53:28,119
QUESTION: Do you have anything? There's been
some instability in Ismaili. There was a warning


659
0:53:28,119 --> 0:53:34,79
for U.S. citizens. But do you have anything
more specific to talk about the violence in


660
0:53:34,79 --> 0:53:35,39
Azerbaijan, police response?


661
0:53:35,39 --> 0:53:38,0
MS. NULAND: Let me take that one as well,
Scott, and we'll get to you.


662
0:53:38,0 --> 0:53:38,21
Dana.


663
0:53:38,21 --> 0:53:42,2
QUESTION: I have two unrelated questions.
The first is a follow-up to Mali, and I'm


664
0:53:42,2 --> 0:53:50,559
wondering about the funding for ACOTA and
these troops. Has the State Department asked


665
0:53:50,559 --> 0:53:56,41
Congress for more money beyond the initial
$8 million that was allocated, and how much?


666
0:53:56,41 --> 0:54:2,79
MS. NULAND: We have, Dana. We have the 8 million
that we already had, and then we've just notified


667
0:54:2,79 --> 0:54:8,97
Congress either yesterday or today requesting
an additional 32 million for the ACOTA effort,


668
0:54:8,97 --> 0:54:13,349
and we will continue to evaluate what more
we might need as we work with our African


669
0:54:13,349 --> 0:54:13,7
partners.


670
0:54:13,7 --> 0:54:18,71
QUESTION: And secondly, I just wondered if
you would be able to confirm that the specialty


671
0:54:18,71 --> 0:54:25,63
glasses that the Secretary is wearing have
a Fresnel prism in them, or how long she's


672
0:54:25,63 --> 0:54:27,299
expected to wear the glasses.


673
0:54:27,299 --> 0:54:35,289
MS. NULAND: Well, let me just say in response
to lots of speculation, the Secretary is going


674
0:54:35,289 --> 0:54:40,95
to be wearing the glasses instead of her contacts
for some period of time because of lingering


675
0:54:40,95 --> 0:54:48,849
issues that stemmed from her concussion. She
sees just fine with them, and she also enjoyed


676
0:54:48,849 --> 0:54:54,93
some of the comments she saw in the press
about the extra sort of diplomatic lift she


677
0:54:54,93 --> 0:54:58,38
gets from gesturing with them. So - all right?


678
0:54:58,38 --> 0:54:59,269
QUESTION: May I just --


679
0:54:59,269 --> 0:55:1,47
MS. NULAND: Thank you very much. I think we've
gone a long while here, Goyal. Thanks.


680
0:55:1,47 --> 0:55:1,849
QUESTION: Thank you.


681
0:55:1,849 --> 0:57:1,849
MS. NULAND: All right.
