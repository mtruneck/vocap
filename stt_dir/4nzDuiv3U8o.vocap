###17 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: We have a big fire behind us.
###19 There's going to be an even bigger fire at 12 o'clock.
###21 And we're doing it for a reason.
###23 
###38 This is Belfast, capital city of Northern Ireland, and long
###41 considered the European capital of terrorism.
###44 To outsiders, it's a city defined by the centuries-long
###47 conflict between Catholics and Protestants, which, reduced to
###50 its simplest parts, pits nationalist Catholics
###52 demanding unity with Republic of Ireland against unionist
###55 Protestants who want to remain part of the United Kingdom.
###58 In 1969, the modern version of the Troubles, as the conflict
###61 is locally known, kicked off when British troops were
###64 dispatched to Northern Ireland to quell a spike
###66 in sectarian violence.
###67 It would turn into a 30 year troop deployment, a violent
###70 civil war that claimed 3,600 lives.
###73 In 1998, after years of killings, bombings, hunger
###76 strikes, kneecappings, torture, and terror, the
###78 political parties of Northern Ireland and representatives of
###81 both Catholic and Protestant paramilitary groups signed the
###83 Good Friday Agreement.
###85 Weapons were decommissioned, paramilitary prisoners were
###87 released, and peace came to Ulster.
###89 But it's been a tenuous, brittle peace.
###91 We went to Northern Ireland during the height of the
###93 marching season, when unionists bang their drums and
###96 celebrate a centuries-old Protestant military victory
###98 over a Catholic king.
###100 Tensions were high and, we soon discovered, while the war
###102 may have ended, the conflict is far from over.
###104 
###109 [CHEERING]
###112 
###149 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: Our guide to the Catholic side of the
###151 conflict was Gerry Foster, a former member of the INLA, a
###154 Catholic paramilitary group that's a lot like the
###156 better-known IRA, but with more references to socialism
###159 and Che Guevara.
###160 GERRY FOSTER: I was in prison for a [INAUDIBLE] bomb,
###163 attacked [INAUDIBLE] party headquarters, which would have
###166 been the biggest pro-British party in Ireland at that time.
###170 And their leadership was having a meeting.
###172 And [INAUDIBLE]
###173 a young lad and planted a bomb.
###175 The intention was to wipe them out, to kill them all.
###179 The bomb did go off and did destroy the building.
###181 But the British were able to get out of the
###184 building just before--
###185 no one was hurt-- just before the bomb went off.
###188 There was a feeling of disappointment.
###191 And now that sounds a bit mad now-- looking back and you
###193 were disappointed that people weren't killed.
###195 But I'm talking about how I felt at that time.
###197 I had that naivete that if we got rid of the British, the
###201 world would be great.
###202 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: This guy with Gerry is Alistair Little.
###204 Alistair joined the Ulster Volunteer Force, a Protestant
###207 paramilitary organization, before he was
###209 old enough to drive.
###210 He was convicted of murder and spent 13 years in the
###213 notorious H-block of the Maze Prison.
###215 Upon his release, Alastair, repentant for the crimes he
###217 committed, teamed up with Gerry, his former enemy, and
###220 dedicated himself to peace work between the two
###222 communities.
###223 ALISTAIR LITTLE: When I was a paramilitary, I didn't care.
###225 I would have done anything.
###226 I'm on record, and it's been published where I would have
###229 wanted to go onto a bus and take all the Protestants off
###233 it and kill everybody on.
###234 
###237 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: So when you went to jail, it
###239 was for dong what?
###242 For shooting somebody, right?
###243 ALISTAIR LITTLE: Yeah, There's a number of charges.
###244 But the main charge was going into a house of a a Catholic
###250 nationalist gang, shooting them dead.
###252 
###255 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: In Belfast, Protestant and Catholic
###256 communities zigzag across the landscape, often
###259 abutting each other.
###260 If the political murals and flags don't provide enough of
###262 a guide to neighborhood divides, the confused visitor
###265 can simply follow the peace walls, unsightly physical
###268 barriers that, 13 years after the Good Friday Agreement,
###271 still separate communities by religion.
###274 ALISTAIR LITTLE: There's more peace walls exist today than
###277 there was during the conflict.
###279 In the whole of Northern Ireland, there's over 80 walls
###282 and gates that separate communities.
###285 GERRY FOSTER: So the gates are closed, because once it starts
###287 for young people, it only escalates and
###289 gets worse and worse.
###290 So it's easier now just to close the gates at night,
###292 leave it at that.
###293 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: And they do close them?
###294 GERRY FOSTER: Yeah.
###294 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: Yeah.
###296 I mean, these are really enormous.
###299 Are they to prevent people from hurling things over?
###301 Petrol bombs?
###302 ALISTAIR LITTLE: Yeah.
###302 They increased the height of that because
###304 they were still throwing.
###305 GERRY FOSTER: Still throwing.
###307 GERRY FOSTER: Because the past hasn't really been dealt with
###310 politically, there's still tensions, there's still fears,
###314 there's still suspicions.
###315 
###323 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: What's the kind of mix now between those
###324 two communities?
###325 What is the level of interaction, whether it's
###327 people dating one another, kids--
###330 do they see the divide the way that you guys
###331 did 20 years ago?
###333 ALISTAIR LITTLE: In Belfast, in the city center, there
###336 would be more of that now happening among students or
###339 through peace work that's been done through community groups.
###342 In the housing estate that I grew up in, in the early years
###346 of the conflict, if a girl had been going with a Catholic,
###350 they might have been tied to a lamp post and their heads
###353 sheared or a placard put around there--
###354 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: Has that actually happened?
###355 ALISTAIR LITTLE: Yeah.
###356 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: That's like Nazi Germany shit.
###358 ALISTAIR LITTLE: Well, especially in Belfast--
###359 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: Shaving heads and--
###360 ALISTAIR LITTLE: If you'd have got a Republican girl or a
###364 nationalist girl going with a soldier, they would have been
###368 tarred and feathered.
###369 So they would have had tar poured over them.
###371 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: Let's be clear about is.
###372 That's not a metaphorical thing.
###373 You mean literally tarred and feathered?
###375 ALISTAIR LITTLE: Yeah.
###376 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: And that's happened?
###377 GERRY FOSTER: Yeah.
###377 ALISTAIR LITTLE: Yeah.
###380 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: In a small loyalist enclave nestled
###382 between Catholic neighborhoods and the Falls Road, we came
###385 across a throng of kids stacking pallets for the
###388 evening's pre-July 12 bonfire.
###390 Identifying himself as a former UVF prisoner, Alistair
###393 negotiated our entry into the area.
###396 ALISTAIR LITTLE: It's a commemoration of the Battle of
###398 the Boyne in 1690, King William defeating King James.
###404 So they would have lit beacons all along the way to send a
###408 message, which was just a celebration of that.
###411 It's also very symbolic in terms of identity.
###414 Notice, you can see the flags that they're burning as the
###418 flags of the Republic of Ireland, which is seen as the
###422 enemy or foreign state.
###423 
###425 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: You guys aren't going to burn
###426 that one, are you?
###428 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: You're going to burn that one, right?
###429 
###431 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: Who's this guy?
###433 
###435 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: What's on his head?
###437 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: Yeah?
###438 Why does he have a penis on his head?
###440 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: He's a wank dog.
###442 
###444 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: Fuck a Pope.
###446 Fuck a Pope?
###448 You don't like the Pope?
###450 
###453 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: Pope's a dick.
###454 All right.
###455 There we go.
###456 For all the Americans out there, what's the celebration?
###459 Explain it to them.
###460 
###467 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: The kids over here are sort of
###470 impregnated with all these phrases.
###472 When you ask them a little more about them, they don't
###474 seem to know what they're talking about.
###475 But they do hate the IRA.
###478 They hate Fenians.
###479 One kid said, don't use "Fenian,"
###481 because it's too nice.
###482 Call them Taigs.
###483 And they really, really cannot stand Catholics.
###486 And the strange thing about it is on every side that you see
###489 here, and even right behind us, are Catholic
###491 neighborhoods.
###492 And they have a sort of weird siege mentality.
###494 They said people throw petrol bombs, people throw rocks into
###497 the estate.
###498 So I suppose it's a bit understandable.
###500 
###503 ALISTAIR LITTLE: One of the difficulties a lot of people
###506 involved in peace work would encounter--
###509 and many don't understand--
###511 is that they ask young people to do things that they're not
###513 prepared to do themselves.
###514 If the conflict gives them a sense of importance, and if it
###519 seems significant as a young person, if there's a sense of
###522 belonging with each other because they're involved in
###525 something special, if they believe that they're standing
###528 up for the community--
###530 all of those things give them such a sense of identity.
###535 When you're asking people to give all that up, there's no
###538 adult would give that up.
