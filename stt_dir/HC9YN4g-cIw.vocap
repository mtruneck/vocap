###23 ARTO SAARI: It's the day of the crooked eyes after the Day
###26 of the Dead.
###28 That was a good kick in the nuts.
###30 I'm going to have to do that again.
###33 Where are we going, Cabo today?
###34 -I think so, yeah.
###35 ARTO SAARI: Holy shit.
###36 Yeah.
###36 Oh, yeah.
###38 Cabo's not in the itinerary.
###40 But we're trying to stretch it and make it all the way to the
###43 [WHISPERING]
###43 tip, if possible.
###46 
###50 How much longer do you think the loop is?
###54 BILL BRYANT: It says that it's 100 to Cabo.
###56 So we would come down that.
###59 ARTO SAARI: That looks [INAUDIBLE] pinnacle, sort of
###61 there a little, that road.
###62 We might just go straight.
###64 BILL BRYANT: Or we can go--
###65 what Chris was saying, let's just go to Pescadero, set up
###68 so everybody knows where we're at, where everything is, and
###70 then just ride down to Cabo.
###72 It's supposed to be--
###72 ARTO SAARI: And then we can drive up.
###73 On the way up, we can go, though.
###75 BILL BRYANT: Yeah, you can do whatever you want.
###76 -Yeah, let's go straight then.
###77 BILL BRYANT: So everybody knows where the base camp is.
###78 And you can do things at your own pace.
###80 ARTO SAARI: All right.
###80 Straight down.
###81 -[INAUDIBLE] sit there and keep driving in
###82 circles if you want.
###83 BILL BRYANT: Right.
###83 You can go up to Sierra La Laguna if you like.
###85 We're just cutting right across the peninsula again.
###87 -How long will that take?
###89 BILL BRYANT: All day.
###90 -Really?
###91 HIME HERBERT: All fucking day, bro.
###93 Seven days of motorcycle riding.
###95 BILL BRYANT: It'll take as much as we've got.
###97 HIME HERBERT: And we're still alive.
###98 
###99 BILL BRYANT: It'll be pinnacle.
###100 HIME HERBERT: My ass is numb, but my mind is strong.
###103 [ROCK AND ROLL]
###121 BILL BRYANT: I was really excited to go to a part of
###125 Baja that I hadn't seen.
###125 I'd seen Cabo from a boat.
###126 And I'd been as far as La Paz before.
###128 But I'd never been in that stretch in between.
###132 Sometimes you have to pay attention to the riding so
###133 much that you forget to stop and smell the
###137 roses, so to speak.
###138 I really enjoyed it.
###139 Pescadero was fun.
###140 [ROCK AND ROLL]
###151 ARTO SAARI: You could retire there fairly peacefully by
###155 yourself, I reckon.
###156 
###159 I think the place is named after fish.
###162 HIME HERBERT: El Pescadero means the fish.
###165 ARTO SAARI: El fucking fish-eria?
###165 HIME HERBERT: Fish-eria.
###166 What's Black Bart's mean in Spanish?
###169 ARTO SAARI: Black Bart's?
###172 Black Horses.
###174 -What?
###175 HIME HERBERT: What was it called?
###177 Lord Black's.
###178 
###183 ARTO SAARI: Take me to your biggest skate park.
###185 Take me to your biggest whatever it is
###187 to skate right now.
###190 The [SPANISH]
###191 in my stomach wants to roll around.
###192 
###197 -I don't see no skate park.
###198 
###210 
###213 HEATH KIRCHART: Played for the Chargers and the Colts, that
###215 never skated?
###217 -Yeah.
###217 HEATH KIRCHART: Just thought the town needed it?
###220 That's the story, right?
###221 -Yeah.
###222 
###230 ARTO SAARI: There's no way.
###231 It looked pretty fucking insane.
###234 It looked like whoever built it were pretty fucking amped
###237 and a few margaritas deep when they started digging that, and
###242 obviously digging more and then pouring concrete on it
###245 and then even building it on top of the concrete, coping
###249 fucking semi lobbing down on it.
###252 I mean, it looked awesome.
###253 It was just fucking full of water.
###254 And you couldn't skate it.
###258 -What are you doing?
###259 HIME HERBERT: I'm doing a test run.
###260 
###263 -You got it.
###264 [LAUGHING]
###267 HIME HERBERT: Oh, god.
###269 Fuck you.
###270 -Want some help?
###271 HIME HERBERT: Oh, god.
###272 
###277 I definitely got some kind of fucking
###279 disease out of this shit.
###280 
###311 HARVEY FOSTER: I had fun skating in that park.
###314 And we didn't do rad tricks because of the situation.
###319 But I don't know.
###322 I had fun.
###323 It could have been the worst skate park.
###325 It could've been really nice.
###327 
###332 ARTO SAARI: What is this?
###333 HIME HERBERT: It's a helmet.
###336 ARTO SAARI: When life sucks, you ride the helmet.
###339 
###351 I got to go take a poo now.
###352 
###356 Because obviously no one--
###360 HIME HERBERT: No one skates sleeveless anymore.
###362 ARTO SAARI: No one brought toilet paper to the session.
###364 So you gotta come up with something.
###369 -Hey, [INAUDIBLE], please film that.
###373 HARVEY FOSTER: So remote, man.
###375 
###383 [DOGS BARKING]
###391 KEEGAN SAUDER: I think it was when I figured out that there
###393 was a full moon and that the rental hut,
###398 although nice, was concrete--
###402 and then I found out that the beach was a half a mile away,
###406 and you can camp on it for free.
###410 So that pretty much sealed the deal.
###413 
###416 I just was going to go down there no matter what, even if
###421 it was alone.
###422 And then everyone seemed to get stoked on it.
###425 
###429 -Ah!
###430 -It bit you?
###431 
###442 ARTO SAARI: Grab a seat, fellas.
###443 
###446 I found two gods on this trip, the god of fire
###451 and the god of margarita.
###453 
###455 A-fucking-men.
###456 
###459 -And that was the story?
###463 -How old were you when you lost your virginity?
###465 HIME HERBERT: Wait.
###465 How old are you, Harvey?
###466 HARVEY FOSTER: 19.
###468 -No, I was 17.
###470 KEEGAN SAUDER: 18.
###473 Arto, what about you?
###473 -For some reason when I was at 17, I thought everyone--
###475 KEEGAN SAUDER: Viking lord?
###477 ARTO SAARI: 15, I think.
###479 KEEGAN SAUDER: Wow.
###480 I could see boning at that age.
###481 But I just never had the balls to do that.
###485 I don't think I could have pulled it off.
###486 ARTO SAARI: It was like, I didn't know at
###488 all what I was doing.
###489 It was just like, [MAKING SOUNDS].
###491 A few pumps.
###492 Oh.
###494 Oh, no.
###495 What happened?
###496 KEEGAN SAUDER: It's pretty rad that we're at an amazing
###499 beach, full moon, and we're just talking about dicks.
###504 Fucking typical.
###505 
###509 -Were you sponsored when you went to Munster
###512 when you were a kid?
###514 ARTO SAARI: I got boards from this local shop
###517 and stuff back home.
###521 -What year was that?
###524 ARTO SAARI: '98, I think.
###527 Somewhere in '98.
###530 HEATH KIRCHART: Wasn't your hair straight back then?
###532 ARTO SAARI: No.
###532 It's always been pretty fucked.
###535 I had a Zoo York cap on the whole time.
###538 HEATH KIRCHART: Zoo York?
###538 ARTO SAARI: Zoo York.
###541 HEATH KIRCHART: I'll never forget that gap, front board
###543 over the pyramid.
###545 ARTO SAARI: I either got second or
###546 third, I can't remember.
###547 I think it was me, Chris Senn, and BA.
###550 But BA won it.
###552 It was like us three.
###553 -You must have been pretty stoked.
###555 That's a solid entrance.
###557 -Do you get health insurance?
###560 KEEGAN SAUDER: I pay for it.
###562 -He's Canadian.
###564 KEEGAN SAUDER: Oh, in the US, though.
###566 Because I live here now.
###568 ARTO SAARI: I just got mine a couple months ago.
###571 I guess I turned into a pussy head.
###574 KEEGAN SAUDER: We can't talk about stuff like that.
###575 We're rebels.
###577 
###579 ARTO SAARI: We're filming for the Flip video.
###580 Early on when I got on, my travel insurance ran out.
###584 I wasn't even living in the States at the time.
###588 I knocked myself out in San Dieguito, trying to warm up on
###591 this rail, knocked myself out.
###596 -Is that the one where you puked?
###597 ARTO SAARI: Yeah, that's the cartoon out of-- yeah.
###600 -Oh, that was fucking gnarly.
###602 ARTO SAARI: That's the first one.
###603 And then two months later, I go to the Vancouver Slam City
###607 Jam, knock myself out in the contest.
###614 Mike Vallely starts a riot.
###617 Someone steps on my hand or kicks it or whatever.
###620 And fucking I wake up at the hospital, my fingers
###623 pointed that way.
###624 My finger is like that.
###627 So there's--
###628 get some beers!
###629 -That's what they're doing.
###630 ARTO SAARI: Get couple.
###632 -[CHUCKLES]
###632 Get couple.
###635 You start using less and less words in your speech later on,
###640 as Reggie takes over.
###642 Beers.
###642 Couple.
###644 Get.
###646 Warrior need drink.
###647 
###649 ARTO SAARI: Eventually, at the end of this trip, it's just
###651 going to be grunts.
###652 [GRUNTING]
###657 That means let's go or I got to get gas.
###660 
###678 KEEGAN SAUDER: Woke up at dawn.
###681 Woke up every hour, really, through the night because it's
###685 camping sleep.
###687 
###695 HEATH KIRCHART: You look at Keegan, and Keegan is just, I
###697 think, the freest one on the trip.
###699 Keegan would be out here camping on
###702 the beach by himself.
###704 Keegan is the most adventurous one of the group.
###708 KEEGAN SAUDER: I just need to do something physical.
###712 I have to feel drained somehow, physically drained.
###718 So that day at the beach, the owner of the surf camp showed
###721 up with boards, surfed all day.
###724 And then I just figured, we've been riding for six days.
###727 And we're definitely going to do that again.
###731 So if this is my one chance to do something completely the
###734 opposite of being on a motorcycle, this is it.
###736 [SURF ROCK]
###743 HEATH KIRCHART: He was out there surfing with people, and
###744 they're telling him their life stories.
###748 That would never happen to me.
###751 There's like a spot where 20 surfers are.
###754 And Keegan will be in there, mixing it up.
###756 I don't want to be in that mix.
###758 I don't want to have to fight a surfer because I don't know
###761 what I'm doing.
###763 I've been skating for 20 years.
###764 You'd think if I stood on a surfboard, I'd look OK.
###767 But I'm just stiff.
###769 [SURF ROCK]
###784 HARVEY FOSTER: Tomas, I hate surfing.
###787 HEATH KIRCHART: I'm that person that when I look back
###789 on shit, I love it.
###791 But when I'm experiencing it, when I'm in it, I'm just kind
###793 of like, all right.
###796 Let's get through it.
###797 HARVEY FOSTER: Just sitting there with this fucking ball
###799 and chain, trying to get out there.
###801 HEATH KIRCHART: I've just been way too [INAUDIBLE] on myself.
###803 That is not how I see it.
###805 Like, I enjoyed this.
###807 I think this is the best city so far.
###810 There's a beach.
###811 It's free to stay on.
###813 People surfing, there's beautiful girls
###817 on the beach here.
###818 There's a bar right there.
###819 
###822 I'd definitely stay longer.
###824 -Reggie!
###825 ARTO SAARI: Aloha.
###827 Mahalo.
###830 [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###832 Surf's up, bro.
###833 [WHISTLES]
###835 
###842 ARTO SAARI: Reginald, how's Harvey doing?
###846 Getting the hang of it?
###848 
###851 Harvey Foster, I can tell that you're cool just by the way
###856 you wear your jeans on the wave.
###857 
###867 HIME HERBERT: Waves were bitching.
###868 It was two to four, south swell, peeling like a mango.
###871 So I had to get out there.
###872 
###878 Yeah, we had a high five moment.
###879 We shred the gnar out there.
###880 HARVEY FOSTER: You did.
###881 HIME HERBERT: We.
###884 HARVEY FOSTER: It was one of the funnest nights of the
###885 trip, funnest nights followed by one of the funnest days.
###889 That whole thing was so worthwhile.
###893 I felt funny after because I was like, man, I was laughing
###896 and having such a good time.
###897 I probably got the worst laugh ever.
###900 Those guys are probably so sick of me laughing right now.
###902 Because I was having a good time.
###904 In this trip, everyone brought something to the table.
###908 Everyone did.
###909 I don't think anybody lacked in any area.
###913 HIME HERBERT: I think collectively, it's an awesome
###916 group of people.
###916 And if one person was missing, it wouldn't be the same.
###919 I imagine we'll all be friends or acquaintances for life at
###924 this point, depending who talks to me after I'm done
###927 with this interview.
###929 KEEGAN SAUDER: It's a bummer that's it's coming to the end
###931 because everyone's seeming to really meld together nicely.
###936 Sad to see the trip done because it's pretty awesome.
###940 But pretty psyched to go home.
###942 It's both, both things.
###944 The end of the road looks pretty good.
###946 But at the same time, it's the end of something.
###950 HARVEY FOSTER: Now that we're going back, I'm kind of like,
###952 whoa, it'd be kind of sick to stay longer now.
###955 I don't mind staying longer.
###957 
###961 HIME HERBERT: You've reached the end.
###963 
###966 So coming back was definitely weird.
###968 Just because you knew that the trip was coming--
###971 not to an end because it still had, fuck, who knows how many
###974 more days until we get back?
###976 That was the first point of the trip that it was like,
###979 we're on our way back home.
###981 -You excited to go back, Bill?
###983 BILL BRYANT: Yes.
###985 -What do you look forward to?
###989 BILL BRYANT: As Arto would say, we have hit the apex on
###992 our way home.
###994 We achieved the pinnacle.
###996 ARTO SAARI: I don't know.
###997 As soon as you reach the apex, and you're going back the same
###999 route, it's just kind of like, let's just fucking go.
###1004 Now it's just like, all right.
###1005 -The relationship is in a slump.
###1007 ARTO SAARI: Yeah.
###1009 Everyone's sick of each other.
###1012 Everyone's heard everyone's stories.
###1015 We need to figure out how to make it a little bit more
###1017 "bromantic." We're going up.
###1020 We're going up north.
###1022 [ROCK]
###1076 -Oh, my god.
###1077 [LAUGHING]
###1082 [INAUDIBLE]
###1083 [ROCK]
###1113 HARVEY FOSTER: I'm trying to get us dinner tonight.
###1115 [ROCK]
###1126 HIME HERBERT: Get out of the way.
###1129 [SPANISH].
###1130 [ROCK]
###1147 BILL BRYANT: The new guys, I think, are generally pretty
###1151 alert at first.
###1152 And then they have a day or two of success and start going
###1156 faster, getting a little crazier and
###1158 having a little fun.
###1159 And that wild west part kicks in.
###1161 And guys are like, pfft, I can do what I want.
###1163 I can take my helmet off.
###1163 And then I think that's when you start getting in trouble.
###1166 
###1174 So we were leaving the old mills in San Quintin, really
###1177 our last day here before we head to the border on the way
###1180 to Ensenada.
###1181 And I was rolling up.
###1182 And I could see something up in the distance.
###1183 And I thought, oh, it's one of those guys
###1185 stopped for a smoke.
###1186 Whatever.
###1186 And then I realized it's a bike laying on its side, and a
###1189 guy who's just sitting on it.
###1189 And I thought, oh, crap.
###1190 This is not good.
###1191 At least he's not laying out in the road.
###1193 He's sitting up, which means he's alert.
###1196 And can't be dead if he's sitting up on his bike.
###1200 Because the way the bike looked was shocking.
###1203 You don't see a Harley turned on its side without some
###1206 damage to man and machine.
###1209 Had that been a day when somebody was wearing skate
###1211 shoes and a t-shirt, it would have been a lot worse.
###1217 KEEGAN SAUDER: If I hadn't have been wearing that helmet,
###1218 I might be dead.
###1221 -[INAUDIBLE]
###1222 KEEGAN SAUDER: I took it off forever.
###1223 And then yesterday I did that skid.
###1226 And then Harvey's like, you should wear a helmet.
###1229 So I was like, OK, I'm taking Harvey's advice.
###1233 I was tumbling.
###1235 The tank slappers, the handlebars, it's just like,
###1238 build up, more and more.
###1239 And then it's [WOOSH].
###1242 I could feel that helmet hitting--
###1244 [WOOSH]
###1245 I could feel it hitting rocks and stuff, too.
###1247 That would have split my head open.
###1250 Maybe I'll slow down now.
###1254 That's the moral.
###1255 -All right.
###1258 Don't scratch it now.
###1259 
###1262 HARVEY FOSTER: Look at this stuff, dude.
###1263 The holes could be gouges in your ribs.
###1265 KEEGAN SAUDER: There was a fucking machete sticking off
###1268 the back.
###1268 -The machete.
###1269 KEEGAN SAUDER: What if it had landed on me?
###1271 -I've thought of that so many times.
###1272 Like, dude, there's a machete right here, sticking up.
###1276 HARVEY FOSTER: I said that to you too.
###1277 I was like, dude, are you sure that's safe?
###1278 And you're like, oh, yeah.
###1279 It's totally fine.
###1281 -All the shit happens.
###1283 And you have--
###1285 KEEGAN SAUDER: I don't know how the fuck [INAUDIBLE].
###1286 -You're going to be sore.
###1287 KEEGAN SAUDER: I got away with it.
###1289 -No road rash.
###1289 No--
###1290 -Oh, yeah.
###1291 Rib cage.
###1292 
###1298 KEEGAN SAUDER: That's the worst one.
###1301 -That would have been all on the top of your head.
###1303 
###1307 KEEGAN SAUDER: I could've just been dead.
###1308 
###1314 -That little fucking ball.
###1318 HARVEY FOSTER: Because you rode through it.
###1320 You rode through it too.
###1322 I'm psyched on you guys for doing that.
###1324 That's a good ride.
###1325 I did it too.
###1326 [ROCK]
###1337 ARTO SAARI: I'll go on a motorcycle trip to anywhere.
###1340 Tierra de Fuego.
###1342 That's it, right?
###1343 Tierra del Fuego.
###1344 The tip of fire.
###1347 Alaska's one place I want to go.
###1349 And fucking tip of fire is one place I want to go.
###1353 If you can combine the two, it would be most apex.
###1357 [ROCK]
###1364 ARTO SAARI: Or start from the bottom.
###1365 Fuck.
###1365 Who knows?
###1366 Go all the way up and then take the Bering Strait across
###1370 to Russia, take the Road of Bones, Mongolia, side by side
###1376 Siberian Express, or even ride on the tracks.
###1379 Go to Scando.
###1381 
###1386 Go up Norway all the way down to Morocco, the
###1390 southern tip of Africa.
###1393 
###1398 Retire in Australia.
###1401 -Jesus.
###1403 -What you just said there was--
###1405 -You're a real go-getter.
###1406 ARTO SAARI: Fucking go get her done while you're at it.
###1411 So what's going on with these beers, anyway?
###1414 It's as important as fuel at this point of the trip.
###1419 This is very important.
###1420
