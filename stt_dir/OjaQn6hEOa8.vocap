###3 This is Bob Marley here, 'nuff respect going out to FoodTube.
###6 Me and Bob are gonna be making Jamaican Ginger Cake. Your Nan loves it, little kids love it,
###10 everybody loves it, it's fantastic. You can have it with butter, ice cream, or just
###15 on its own as a little cake. Beautiful. It is such a great little dessert and its all
###20 the way from the Caribbean to rainy old England so let's brighten up our day, shall we?!
###26 So, we've got some Golden Syrup. Now 125g is what you need. Beautiful. Now I'm gonna
###33 put it all in first then I'm gonna put it on a heat ok? So it's probably 3 of these
###37 big old spoons. I mean it is very, very naughty, which is not a bad thing because it's a dessert
###43 and you deserve it. Treacle! This stuff is lethal. Look at that!
###49 Wow! I wouldn't lick the spoon because you'll probably pass out. Ha ha it's really sweet!
###56 A bit of Rum. 60ml of dark Rum. Now we've got some sugar! Dark brown sugar. You can
###62 use a bit of Demerara if you like. So pop that in. It just makes it really sort of a caramelly
###67 sort of flavour going on, rather than just using normal caster sugar, ok.
###71 50ml of water in there. Unsalted butter, 125g, get that in there. And I'm just gonna turn
###80 that on now. Now, while that's melting you've got enough
###84 time to chop up your stemmed ginger. It's in a lovely syrup so it's really sweet, so
###89 we're doing a dessert so it really does work. You can buy it in the supermarket like this
###93 already. Roughly chop it because you want those little bits of ginger in there. You
###98 don't want it to disappear completely. In with the old stemmed ginger. Now that's
###103 ticking away nicely, you don't wanna boil it. We only want this to tick away until the
###107 butter has melted and all the ingredients have come together. Have a little taste. Aww
###114 that's marvellous! Honestly, it' so good! Our cake or our bread needs to rise to the
###120 occasion so we need a bit of bicarbonate of soda, 3/4 of a tsp there. I'll just pour that
###125 in there now. Alright, lovely. Flour, I've sieved out 250g of the lovely plain flour.
###132 Now we're gonna add our spices. We've got a tsp of ginger in there, half a tsp of all
###136 spices. That is the actual spice of Jamaica. I've got half a tsp of nutmeg and 1 and a
###143 half of cinnamon. Alright, so in you go. Obviously try and distribute it around. Mix it together.
###149 If you can find a smaller spoon, do so. What am I doing?! Get a big one, why not!
###157 Beautiful! Now I'm just gonna crack 2 eggs and whisk them up ok because the yolks are
###161 gonna add that nice richness and the whites gonna help it rise up.
###165 Give it a whisky whisky, ok. We're gonna add this lovely, naughty mixture into our eggs
###174 ok. But you gotta do a little bit at a time because you don't want to scramble the eggs,
###178 do you know what I'm saying?! Once a little bit's gone in there it sort of brings the
###181 temperature down. I'm just gonna whisk it up a little bit, make sure it all comes together.
###188 Now we mix this into our flour. Make sure you really do give it a good old whisk because
###194 you don't want any lumps in there. You can see bubbles moving there. That's the bicarb.
###198 Can you see it working?! Delicious! That is it.
###205 All we have to do now is bake it. So I've got this nice little loaf tin over here. A
###209 little bit of butter inside and some greaseproof paper, that's it. Now make sure your oven
###215 is preheated to 170°C. Let's introduce this into the tin now. Here we go. Wow!
###224 Give it a little knock like that, make sure the bubbles have gone out and it's distributed
###228 nicely in the tin. So there we go. That goes into an oven at 170°C for about an hour and
###233 fifteen minutes. An hour and fifteen minutes has passed! What
###238 Jamaicing? Ginger cake. Ooooh. Let's see if it's ready. Boom, straight in
###244 the middle. Now this, should, in theory come out nice and clear. Spot on every time. Look
###251 at that. Beautiful. If it's got a bit of goo on it whack it back in for another 5-10 minutes.
###259 Yummy! I've had this on a cooling rack for half an hour now. Beautiful! Look at that
###265 little baby there. You can see lovely, sticky treacle in there. What better accompany than
###273 a nice bit of vanilla ice-cream. Look at that! Praline, oooh yeah!
###284 What's that? He prefers it with butter, I like it with ice-cream. Guys, go for it. Mmm
###292 really works with that ice-cream. Wooo, that's lovely! Yep alright, in a minute.
