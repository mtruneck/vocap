###0 Are you ready?
###3 Because it's time to
###6 cause an uproar.
###8 Right now,
###9 Big Cats are
###10 Disappearing from our planet
###13 at an alarming rate
###15 Lions, cheetahs, leopards, tigers
###21 In fact, at this moment,
###23 there are more tigers
###26 in captivity,
###27 than there are left in the wild.
###30 Really?
###32 We have to stop
###33 the decline of big cats now
###35 before we end up talking about
###37 lions
###38 and leopards
###40 the way we talk about dinosaurs.
