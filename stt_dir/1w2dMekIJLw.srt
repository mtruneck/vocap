1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:1,62



2
0:0:1,62 --> 0:0:3,81
NARRATOR: For as long as I can
remember, I've had an interest


3
0:0:3,81 --> 0:0:6,17
in what some people
condescendingly term


4
0:0:6,17 --> 0:0:8,31
conspiracy theory.


5
0:0:8,31 --> 0:0:11,7
You see, I was born November 22,
the anniversary of John F


6
0:0:11,7 --> 0:0:13,42
Kennedy's assassination.


7
0:0:13,42 --> 0:0:15,47
And every year on my birthday
there's been televised


8
0:0:15,47 --> 0:0:18,42
specials on practically every
channel talking about magic


9
0:0:18,42 --> 0:0:23,86
bullets, grassy knolls, other
shooters, as well as CIA, FBI,


10
0:0:23,86 --> 0:0:25,66
and mafia involvement.


11
0:0:25,66 --> 0:0:29,23
Even by the age of 10
this spoke to me.


12
0:0:29,23 --> 0:0:32,21
And, of course, there were UFOs,
the Illuminati, occult


13
0:0:32,21 --> 0:0:35,66
Nazis, organized satanic
networks, faked moon landings


14
0:0:35,66 --> 0:0:37,73
and CIA mind control programs.


15
0:0:37,73 --> 0:0:40,9
Hell, even if this is
all bullshit, it


16
0:0:40,9 --> 0:0:41,34
was fun to read about.


17
0:0:41,34 --> 0:1:4,78



18
0:1:4,78 --> 0:1:7,78
It was in 2000 that I first
discovered David Icke's book,


19
0:1:7,78 --> 0:1:10,86
"The Biggest Secret." In it
he writes about a global


20
0:1:10,86 --> 0:1:12,37
conspiracy.


21
0:1:12,37 --> 0:1:14,86
A hidden hand manipulating
humanity's destiny through the


22
0:1:14,86 --> 0:1:18,53
shadows using those who
seem to be in power.


23
0:1:18,53 --> 0:1:20,82
And the goal of these
shadow people?


24
0:1:20,82 --> 0:1:24,7
Nothing less than an Orwellian
global super state with total


25
0:1:24,7 --> 0:1:26,3
control at the hands of
an ancient reptilian


26
0:1:26,3 --> 0:1:28,31
shapeshifting race.


27
0:1:28,31 --> 0:1:30,87
So we took a ferry to the Isle
of Wight to spend the day with


28
0:1:30,87 --> 0:1:34,25
David Icke, Britain's leading
conspiracy evangelist, and the


29
0:1:34,25 --> 0:1:38,172
one man standing between us
and total enslavement.


30
0:1:38,172 --> 0:1:38,608
NARRATOR: Hey!


31
0:1:38,608 --> 0:1:39,48
DAVID ICKE: Ah.


32
0:1:39,48 --> 0:1:40,29
NARRATOR: Mr. Icke.


33
0:1:40,29 --> 0:1:40,66
DAVID ICKE: Kev, nice
to meet you.


34
0:1:40,66 --> 0:1:41,332
NARRATOR: Nice to meet you.


35
0:1:41,332 --> 0:1:42,36
DAVID ICKE: Good trip?


36
0:1:42,36 --> 0:1:43,12
NARRATOR: Yes.


37
0:1:43,12 --> 0:1:43,5
Yes.


38
0:1:43,5 --> 0:1:44,11
It was.


39
0:1:44,11 --> 0:1:45,26
DAVID ICKE: Welcome
to my abode.


40
0:1:45,26 --> 0:1:48,4
There's not much to see,
but I like it.


41
0:1:48,4 --> 0:1:49,6
NARRATOR: What have
we got here?


42
0:1:49,6 --> 0:1:51,24
DAVID ICKE: Well, this is things
that I've collected


43
0:1:51,24 --> 0:1:51,92
over the years.


44
0:1:51,92 --> 0:1:52,92
This is fantastic.


45
0:1:52,92 --> 0:1:57,81
Someone in Hawaii actually
painted this.


46
0:1:57,81 --> 0:1:59,32
This is what the painting is.


47
0:1:59,32 --> 0:2:2,33
This is the original of the
front cover of my last book,


48
0:2:2,33 --> 0:2:4,447
"Human Race Get Off Your Knees:
The Lion Sleeps No


49
0:2:4,447 --> 0:2:10,62
More." And I asked my great
friend, an artist called Neil


50
0:2:10,62 --> 0:2:12,86
Hague, to paint this picture
for me with, particularly,


51
0:2:12,86 --> 0:2:14,9
those eyes.


52
0:2:14,9 --> 0:2:16,983
And that's humanity
saying, no more.


53
0:2:16,983 --> 0:2:17,67
Enough.


54
0:2:17,67 --> 0:2:19,4
No more little me.


55
0:2:19,4 --> 0:2:21,82
We're not having it anymore.


56
0:2:21,82 --> 0:2:24,32
NARRATOR: In 1991 David Icke
didn't believe in secret


57
0:2:24,32 --> 0:2:26,5
shapeshifting lizard fascists.


58
0:2:26,5 --> 0:2:28,68
He was a television celebrity.


59
0:2:28,68 --> 0:2:31,19
After arthritis had ended a
promising career in football,


60
0:2:31,19 --> 0:2:32,69
he'd become a broadcaster.


61
0:2:32,69 --> 0:2:35,2
But that all ended in one
remarkable appearance on the


62
0:2:35,2 --> 0:2:35,98
Terry Wogan show.


63
0:2:35,98 --> 0:2:37,67
-David Icke.


64
0:2:37,67 --> 0:2:39,74
NARRATOR: In a turquoise
tracksuit he'd announced that


65
0:2:39,74 --> 0:2:41,1
he was the son of God.


66
0:2:41,1 --> 0:2:43,45
And the world would be
ending that year.


67
0:2:43,45 --> 0:2:45,72
It didn't, and Icke seemed
destined to disappear beneath


68
0:2:45,72 --> 0:2:48,3
a typhoon of public laughter.


69
0:2:48,3 --> 0:2:50,46
-It's quite funny really.


70
0:2:50,46 --> 0:2:55,4
2000 years ago had a guy called
Jesus sat here and said


71
0:2:55,4 --> 0:2:56,75
these same things, you would
still be laughing.


72
0:2:56,75 --> 0:2:59,11
It's really, really funny that
we've not really moved on that


73
0:2:59,11 --> 0:2:59,52
much.


74
0:2:59,52 --> 0:3:0,67
-They're laughing at you.


75
0:3:0,67 --> 0:3:2,677
They're not laughing with you.


76
0:3:2,677 --> 0:3:5,6
-Fine.


77
0:3:5,6 --> 0:3:7,34
NARRATOR: But Icke wouldn't
disappear.


78
0:3:7,34 --> 0:3:8,94
He began to write.


79
0:3:8,94 --> 0:3:11,38
And over a series of
increasingly successful books,


80
0:3:11,38 --> 0:3:14,13
he began to outline
his philosophy.


81
0:3:14,13 --> 0:3:16,75
Humankind was not in charge
of its destiny.


82
0:3:16,75 --> 0:3:19,15
It was the unwitting prisoner
of a race of shapeshifting


83
0:3:19,15 --> 0:3:20,69
lizards who occupied
the roles in the


84
0:3:20,69 --> 0:3:22,59
highest echelons of society.


85
0:3:22,59 --> 0:3:25,43
From presidents to royal
families, all trusted public


86
0:3:25,43 --> 0:3:28,39
figures were secretly part of a
reptilian satanist pedophile


87
0:3:28,39 --> 0:3:31,89
group who had been on this
planet for centuries.


88
0:3:31,89 --> 0:3:34,89
People began to take notice of
Icke, and today he spends most


89
0:3:34,89 --> 0:3:38,22
of his year preaching to
amphitheaters full of fans.


90
0:3:38,22 --> 0:3:40,795
He's still making startling
revelations, and recently he


91
0:3:40,795 --> 0:3:42,99
declared the moon to be a
hollowed out planetoid space


92
0:3:42,99 --> 0:3:45,77
station from which our
minds are controlled.


93
0:3:45,77 --> 0:3:48,226
The lizard's very
own Death Star.


94
0:3:48,226 --> 0:3:50,13
Don't mention the reptiles,
chapter two.


95
0:3:50,13 --> 0:3:51,34
DAVID ICKE: Don't mention
the reptiles, yeah.


96
0:3:51,34 --> 0:3:54,6
Because people-- when they
started to come in people were


97
0:3:54,6 --> 0:3:56,62
kind of into my stuff
up to that point.


98
0:3:56,62 --> 0:3:57,82
Which was kind of regular--


99
0:3:57,82 --> 0:3:58,87
well it was a bit strange.


100
0:3:58,87 --> 0:4:0,73
It was all the way the world was
manipulated by few people,


101
0:4:0,73 --> 0:4:3,46
but it was all kind
of regular stuff.


102
0:4:3,46 --> 0:4:5,17
And then I came across with this
stuff and it was like--


103
0:4:5,17 --> 0:4:6,2
NARRATOR: Get it
out of the way.


104
0:4:6,2 --> 0:4:8,68
DAVID ICKE: --don't mention
the reptiles.


105
0:4:8,68 --> 0:4:9,84
They'll just laugh
at you again.


106
0:4:9,84 --> 0:4:10,96
I said, I know.


107
0:4:10,96 --> 0:4:13,16
But I've seen enough
and heard enough to


108
0:4:13,16 --> 0:4:14,26
believe that it's real.


109
0:4:14,26 --> 0:4:15,56
And so I say it.


110
0:4:15,56 --> 0:4:20,7
I don't care about the
consequences for me.


111
0:4:20,7 --> 0:4:21,209
Are you frightened?


112
0:4:21,209 --> 0:4:21,82
No.


113
0:4:21,82 --> 0:4:22,92
I'm not.


114
0:4:22,92 --> 0:4:24,2
I don't care.


115
0:4:24,2 --> 0:4:27,18
Because the consequences for the
world and my children, and


116
0:4:27,18 --> 0:4:30,71
my grandchildren, and everyone
else's, of humans not


117
0:4:30,71 --> 0:4:33,64
intervening in this process
that's going on now ever more


118
0:4:33,64 --> 0:4:37,34
quickly, are that we are
condemning our children and


119
0:4:37,34 --> 0:4:37,93
grandchildren--


120
0:4:37,93 --> 0:4:40,6
indeed ourselves, it's
that close--


121
0:4:40,6 --> 0:4:45,78
to a world that George Orwell
so massively understated.


122
0:4:45,78 --> 0:4:47,93
NARRATOR: Can we have a look at
where the work gets done?


123
0:4:47,93 --> 0:4:48,4
DAVID ICKE: Yes.


124
0:4:48,4 --> 0:4:50,95
NARRATOR: Where it
all happens.


125
0:4:50,95 --> 0:4:54,5



126
0:4:54,5 --> 0:4:56,29
DAVID ICKE: This is where
it all happens.


127
0:4:56,29 --> 0:4:58,2
As you can see it's
really small.


128
0:4:58,2 --> 0:4:59,38
NARRATOR: It is really small.


129
0:4:59,38 --> 0:5:3,41
DAVID ICKE: Because I look at
my life and I don't see my


130
0:5:3,41 --> 0:5:4,8
life as a life anymore.


131
0:5:4,8 --> 0:5:5,785
I haven't for a while.


132
0:5:5,785 --> 0:5:8,16
I see it as a job.


133
0:5:8,16 --> 0:5:9,615
NARRATOR: So this
is the new one.


134
0:5:9,615 --> 0:5:9,94
In German?


135
0:5:9,94 --> 0:5:10,59
DAVID ICKE: Yeah.


136
0:5:10,59 --> 0:5:12,13
This is the German version,
isn't it?


137
0:5:12,13 --> 0:5:12,93
Look at the size of that.


138
0:5:12,93 --> 0:5:13,52
NARRATOR: Jeez, yeah.


139
0:5:13,52 --> 0:5:14,68
DAVID ICKE: 250,000 words.


140
0:5:14,68 --> 0:5:18,79
That, in one book, is the scale
of information that has


141
0:5:18,79 --> 0:5:20,88
come into my life about
these things.


142
0:5:20,88 --> 0:5:23,5
See, that is not a theory.


143
0:5:23,5 --> 0:5:26,1
That is evidence supporting
a fact.


144
0:5:26,1 --> 0:5:28,43
NARRATOR: What was the first
book that really struck you?


145
0:5:28,43 --> 0:5:31,25
Because, I know, there
was a couple for me.


146
0:5:31,25 --> 0:5:33,56
Are you familiar with
Robert Anton Wilson?


147
0:5:33,56 --> 0:5:33,895
DAVID ICKE: Yeah.


148
0:5:33,895 --> 0:5:34,23
Yeah.


149
0:5:34,23 --> 0:5:36,835
NARRATOR: And I just liked it
because it was funny and it


150
0:5:36,835 --> 0:5:38,48
tied a lot of points of
interest together.


151
0:5:38,48 --> 0:5:40,57
And he sort of pointed me
in different directions.


152
0:5:40,57 --> 0:5:43,38
Even though he wasn't really a
conspiracy theorist trying to


153
0:5:43,38 --> 0:5:45,91
say anything.


154
0:5:45,91 --> 0:5:47,41
He put things together
I never saw.


155
0:5:47,41 --> 0:5:48,1
DAVID ICKE: Right.


156
0:5:48,1 --> 0:5:49,75
NARRATOR: He'd connect dots that
had never occurred to me.


157
0:5:49,75 --> 0:5:52,67
Which turned me to "Holy, Blood,
Holy Grail," and some


158
0:5:52,67 --> 0:5:53,71
of these other things.


159
0:5:53,71 --> 0:5:55,69
DAVID ICKE: You've just hit the
nail right on the head of


160
0:5:55,69 --> 0:5:58,4
my work and what you need
to do to understand


161
0:5:58,4 --> 0:5:58,64
what's going on.


162
0:5:58,64 --> 0:6:0,7
Connect the dots.


163
0:6:0,7 --> 0:6:4,84
See, there are dots, like
banking, government, all these


164
0:6:4,84 --> 0:6:8,97
different things, 9/11, which
in and of themselves are


165
0:6:8,97 --> 0:6:9,76
interesting.


166
0:6:9,76 --> 0:6:11,81
And you can see that something's
not right.


167
0:6:11,81 --> 0:6:16,0
But when you connect the dots
between apparently unconnected


168
0:6:16,0 --> 0:6:18,91
people and situations and
organizations, that's when the


169
0:6:18,91 --> 0:6:20,22
tapestry appears.


170
0:6:20,22 --> 0:6:21,77
And you go, whoa.


171
0:6:21,77 --> 0:6:24,48
So that's what's happening.


172
0:6:24,48 --> 0:6:26,9
NARRATOR: David had told us
that his first moment of


173
0:6:26,9 --> 0:6:28,34
enlightenment had occurred when
a voice entered his head


174
0:6:28,34 --> 0:6:31,6
while shopping with his
son on the sea front.


175
0:6:31,6 --> 0:6:33,51
DAVID ICKE: This is the news
agent I told you about where,


176
0:6:33,51 --> 0:6:35,4
basically, it all started.


177
0:6:35,4 --> 0:6:40,74
I was walking along here and I
walked in this door and turned


178
0:6:40,74 --> 0:6:43,7
to where Gareth was reading
his Spin Train books.


179
0:6:43,7 --> 0:6:44,66
And this is where it happened.


180
0:6:44,66 --> 0:6:46,18
Just the other side
of this door.


181
0:6:46,18 --> 0:6:48,74
Where I'm like, what's
going on?


182
0:6:48,74 --> 0:6:50,27
Go and look at the books
on the far side.


183
0:6:50,27 --> 0:6:51,8
What?


184
0:6:51,8 --> 0:6:51,89
What?


185
0:6:51,89 --> 0:6:52,91
And that's where it started.


186
0:6:52,91 --> 0:6:53,79
1990.


187
0:6:53,79 --> 0:6:55,41
March, 1990.


188
0:6:55,41 --> 0:6:57,31
And I never thought it was going
to lead where it has.


189
0:6:57,31 --> 0:6:59,284
But it has.


190
0:6:59,284 --> 0:6:59,771
Yeah.


191
0:6:59,771 --> 0:7:1,79
NARRATOR: Well, it was
a great beginning.


192
0:7:1,79 --> 0:7:3,4
Platform Fun.


193
0:7:3,4 --> 0:7:6,6



194
0:7:6,6 --> 0:7:10,9
DAVID ICKE: In simple terms,
there is a predator race which


195
0:7:10,9 --> 0:7:12,26
take a reptilian form.


196
0:7:12,26 --> 0:7:13,86
They're feeding off humanity.


197
0:7:13,86 --> 0:7:16,86
They've turned humanity
into a slave race.


198
0:7:16,86 --> 0:7:18,64
They demand human sacrifice.


199
0:7:18,64 --> 0:7:20,56
That's where satanism
comes in.


200
0:7:20,56 --> 0:7:23,9
They feed off human energy,
particularly feed off the


201
0:7:23,9 --> 0:7:26,2
energy of children.


202
0:7:26,2 --> 0:7:27,3
NARRATOR: David's latest
revelations have


203
0:7:27,3 --> 0:7:28,93
been about the moon.


204
0:7:28,93 --> 0:7:31,96
Far from a lump of benign rock
orbiting us, it is in fact an


205
0:7:31,96 --> 0:7:35,63
artificial construct, a gigantic
spacecraft, probably


206
0:7:35,63 --> 0:7:37,93
a hollowed out planetoid.


207
0:7:37,93 --> 0:7:40,92
It is from the moon that the
nefarious Illuminati


208
0:7:40,92 --> 0:7:43,5
manipulate the collective
human mind.


209
0:7:43,5 --> 0:7:44,86
Warping our perception
of reality.


210
0:7:44,86 --> 0:7:47,89
DAVID ICKE: I'm saying it's
broadcasting something.


211
0:7:47,89 --> 0:7:52,32
That it acts as a blocking
frequency that stops us seeing


212
0:7:52,32 --> 0:7:55,7
and perceiving things that we
would normally perceive.


213
0:7:55,7 --> 0:7:57,97
That is creating what I call the
moon matrix, or the satin


214
0:7:57,97 --> 0:7:59,1
moon matrix.


215
0:7:59,1 --> 0:8:2,58

216
0:8:2,58 --> 0:8:4,45
in "The Matrix" movies.


217
0:8:4,45 --> 0:8:6,4
NARRATOR: I guess that makes
David the Isle of


218
0:8:6,4 --> 0:8:7,39
Wight's very own Neo.

0:8:7,39 --> 0:10:7,39
