###25 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Well, of course, we wish you a very happy new year and a very
###30 warm welcome as we kick off 2013 on CNN STUDENT NEWS. My name is Carl Azuz. We are glad you`re
###36 joining us. We hope your year is off to a good start.
###39 One question we had going in to the break was, will Congress and President Obama find
###44 a way to avoid the fiscal cliff? When we put this show together last night, we still had
###49 that question. What came to be knows is the fiscal cliff was really a series of automatic
###54 tax increases and government spending cuts that were scheduled to take effect at the
###58 start of the year.
###59 The reason - U.S. Government has too much debt. Now, the president and Congress could
###64 have avoided that fiscal cliff by coming up with the compromise, a different plan to reduce
###69 the debt. But as of yesterday, still no agreement. There are two main ways to reduce debt: cut
###75 down on spending and or raise taxes. One big sticking point was whom to raise taxes on
###82 and by how much? The president wanted families making more than $250,000 a year to pay more
###88 in taxes. He said they could afford it. Critics said the economy is too weak to raise taxes
###94 on anyone.
###95 The Senate came up with a bipartisan compromise to raise taxes, but only on families making
###101 more than $450,00 a year. The plan would be a temporary fix, it would last for two months,
###108 and it would delay any cuts in government spending. The thing is, the compromise also
###112 has to pass the U.S. House of Representatives, and it wasn`t clear yesterday if it would
###117 do that. Cnn.com has your latest updates.

###121 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See if you can I.D. me. I was born in Chicago in 1947. In 1992, my
###131 husband was elected president and in the year 2000, I was elected to the U.S. Senate. I`m
###138 the only former first lady to have served there and in the presidential cabinet.
###144 I`m Hillary Clinton, the current U.S. Secretary of State.

###153 AZUZ: Secretary Clinton spent New Year`s day in the hospital after getting a blood clot
###157 in her head. Doctors say she`s on blood thinners to dissolve the clot and they expect she`ll
###162 be OK. This is the latest of a few health issues she had. Clinton caught a stomach virus
###167 in December, which made her dehydrated. She fainted because of that, which gave her a
###172 concussion. This blood clot was a result of that concussion. Clinton had to stay home
###176 for most of December. She didn`t testify as scheduled about September`s deadly terrorist
###182 attack on the U.S. Building in Benghazi, Libya. Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores what`s next in her
###187 recovery.
###188 DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It is a blood vessel that actually drains blood
###192 away from the brain. It`s called the cerebral vein, and I want to show you here, we know
###196 that in Secretary Clinton`s case it is actually on the right side of her head, somewhere in
###200 this area, it`s called the right transverse sinus.
###203 Let me show you on this model here, I`ll show you the left side just for sake of demonstration
###208 here. I removed the hemisphere of the brain here. You can actually see where the - where
###213 the veins are. You see that blue area right in there. That is the area that is actually
###217 draining blood away from the brain. And one of these veins in this area, that`s where
###223 that clot actually has occurred. Most likely, due to a combination of the head trauma that
###228 she had a few weeks ago in addition to the fact that she has had a problem with blood
###233 clots in the past, dating back to 1998. We heard from her doctors. They say that she`s
###238 on blood winners, they say she`s awake, she`s talking. And most importantly, there is no
###242 evidence of stroke or neurological damage.
###246 My guess is that they are going to monitor her at least for another couple of days in
###249 the hospital and probably get another scan at some point to make sure that clot is in
###253 fact dissolved as the result of those blood- thinning medications. As we get more details,
###258 we certainly bring them to you. Back to you for now.
###261 AZUZ: Thank you, Dr. Gupta.
###262 For a while now, Secretary Clinton has been planning to step down from her position, once
###266 a new nominee is confirmed by the Senate. The president`s choice for the job is this
###271 man, Senator John Kerry. You might have heard that name before. He ran for president and
###275 lost to incumbent president, George W. Bush in 2004. On December 21st, President Obama
###282 nominated Kerry for U.S. Secretary of State. He`s done extensive traveling and met with
###287 international officials on behalf of the Obama administration, but as many of you have already
###292 learned, Kerry`s nomination doesn`t necessarily mean he`ll get the job. The Senate will have
###297 the final say as part of the advice and consent it gives the president.

###302 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Time for the year`s first "Shoutout." Which of the following is associated
###307 with Abraham Lincoln: if you think you know the answer, then shout it out!
###312 Is it the Treaty of Paris, Emancipation Proclamation, Articles of Confederation or Treaty of Versailles?
###319 You`ve got three seconds, go!
###328 President Abraham Lincoln`s Emancipation Proclamation took effect on January 1, 1863. That`s your
###336 answer and that`s your shoutout.
###340 And that made January 1, 2013 the 150th anniversary of when the Emancipation Proclamation took
###347 effect. In honor of that. U.S. Postal Service unveiled this new stamp yesterday.
###353 President Lincoln`s proclamation was made during the U.S. Civil War. It said that anyone
###357 who was a slave in a rebellious state was set free. It didn`t apply to all U.S. States,
###363 and it didn`t officially end slavery in the U.S. The 13th Amendment did that. But the
###368 Emancipation Proclamation helped pave the way to the end of slavery.
###371 Of course, there are a number of new laws in effect as of yesterday. Last fall, we told
###376 you a couple of states were legalizing recreational marijuana. In some others, voters approved
###381 same sex marriage. Here are a few laws you might not have known about. In Illinois and
###387 California, employers can no longer require workers to share their social media passwords.
###392 Some privacy concerns about that. Also, if you live in Illinois, forget about shark fins
###397 soup, it`s now illegal to have shark fins at all. And you could get fined to thousand
###402 bucks if you pop a wheely on a motorcycle. If you own a swamp buggy in Florida, you no
###407 longer have to register it as a motor vehicle, that will save some folks a step. Concord,
###412 Massachusetts has officially banned plastic bottles. They could be confiscated and as
###416 far as animals go, cat lovers in Wellington, Kansas, might call a new law, catty (ph).
###422 It says you can`t have more than four felines living in your house. And if you`ve got a
###426 wild hog in Kentucky, you`d better not release it into the wild. Officials don`t want their
###430 state to become a hog haven.
###433 Well, if you live in or near major city, you might have heard some fire works the other
###437 night, as people welcome 2013 with a bang. Times Square topped off today`s show, but
###442 before we sign off we are going to give you a glimpse of the pyrotechnics prowess proudly
###447 portrayed by cities around the world. Sit back and enjoy our international tour of how
###452 12 a.m on January 1 looked, as the world`s spun around to a new year.
