###0 PROFESSOR: OKAY. SO I GUESS IT'S TIME TO GET STARTED. ALL
###7 RIGHT SO THE LECTURE EXAM'S GOING TO BE A WEEK FROM MONDAY. AND
###11 THERE'LL BE 50 QUESTIONS FROM ME AND THEN THE REST FROM THE OTHER
###16 TWO INSTRUCTORS. AND AS FAR AS RUNNING THIS REVIEW GOES, AND
###21 THERE'S A LOT OF MATERIAL TO REVIEW IN AN HOUR, BUT I THOUGHT
###27 QUITE A LOT ABOUT THE EXAM. AND I WANTED TO GO OVER SOME
###32 GENERAL POINTS THAT I THINK YOU SHOULD BE SURE TO STUDY. I MEAN
###38 PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME WHAT DEPTH OF STUDY THEY SHOULD GO INTO.
###42 AND I DEFINITELY WANT TO REITERATE THAT THE BOOK IS JUST
###44 SUPPLEMENTARY TO THE LECTURE MATERIAL, SO WHAT'S ON THOSE SLIDES
###47 THAT I MADE PDFS OF AND POSTED IS THE MATERIAL YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE
###52 FOR. AND THE READING WAS JUST TO AUGMENT THAT TO TRY TO HELP TO
###58 UNDERSTAND THOSE CONCEPTS RATHER THAN IF THERE ARE NEW CONCEPTS
###61 AND TERMS THAT COME UP IN THE READING, YOU DON'T NEED TO, TO BE
###65 ABLE TO RECALL THOSE. SO I KNOW THAT THERE IS SOME MATERIAL I
###70 DIDN'T GET TO IN THE, IN THE ASSIGNED READING. AND YOU KNOW
###75 THAT'S REALLY JUST TO PUT THINGS IN CONTEXT RATHER THAN TO, YOU
###79 KNOW, PROVIDE YOU WITH NEW INFORMATION THAT YOU, YOU'RE
###82 RESPONSIBLE FOR. ALL RIGHT, SO ONE OF THE, THE FIRST THINGS I
###92 WANT TO MENTION IS AS FAR AS ALL THE DIFFERENT GROUPS OF
###96 ORGANISMS WE COVERED, THE MAJOR GROUPS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT YOU
###102 SHOULD BE FAMILIAR WITH. I MEAN WE TALKED ABOUT THESE THREE
###104 DOMAINS OF LIFE, THE BACTERIA, THE ARCHAEA, AND THE EUKARYOTES,
###109 EUKARYA, BUT WE DIDN'T FOCUS ON, ON A LOT OF THESE GROUPS. YOU
###117 
###117 KNOW, WITH THE MAIN ONES WE FOCUSED ON WERE THE FUNGI AND THE
###121 PHOTOSYNTHETIC GROUPS. AND JUST THESE MAIN GROUPS ARE THE ONES
###128 THAT, THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN ADDITION TO, OF COURSE, LAND
###131 PLANTS. SO THE FUNGI, THE MAJOR GROUPS OF ALGAE, AND THE, THE
###140 LAND PLANTS. AND WE WENT INTO MORE DETAIL THAN, THAN JUST THIS,
###145 OF COURSE. WE WENT INTO, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE FUNGI, THE MAJOR
###152 PHYLA, THOSE FIVE MAJOR GROUPS, AND, AND THE ALGAE. WE DIDN'T
###158 TALK IN MUCH DETAIL ABOUT THE MAJOR CLADES SHOWN HERE AS FAR AS
###163 TAXA WITHIN THOSE. BUT YOU SHOULD BE, YOU SHOULD BE FAMILIAR
###168 WITH THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE GROUPS THAT I TALKED ABOUT AND
###171 BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW DISTINGUISH A DINOFLAGELLATE FROM A DIATOM OR
###176 A BROWN ALGAE FROM A RED ALGAE IN TERMS OF THE SORTS OF THINGS WE
###179 TALKED ABOUT. NOT BEYOND THAT, BUT, BUT THOSE ARE, THAT'S THE
###185 LEVEL OF DETAIL I'M LOOKING FOR. I WOULDN'T BE ASKING YOU TO
###187 RECALL A PARTICULAR GENUS OR YOU KNOW FINE SCALE TAXON OF SOME
###192 KIND WITHIN THOSE GROUPS, BUT THERE WAS QUITE A LOT OF TIME SPENT
###197 ON THESE DIFFERENT, DIFFERENT GROUPS. AND WITHIN THE LAND
###202 PLANTS, OF COURSE, WE TALKED ABOUT BRYOPHYTES, VASCULAR PLANTS,
###206 SEED PLANTS. AND THEN WITHIN THE SEED PLANTS, GYMNOSPERMS AND
###211 ANGIOSPERMS. SO, AND WITHIN THE ANGIOSPERMS YOU KNOW WE SPENT
###214 QUITE A BIT OF TIME COMPARING THE EUDICOT'S AND THE MONOCOT'S
###219 CHARACTERISTICS THERE. SO IT'S THAT LEVEL THAT, THAT WE COVERED
###223 IN CLASS THAT I WANT YOU TO, TO STUDY. ARE THERE QUESTIONS
###230 ABOUT THAT? ALL RIGHT, SO AS FAR AS THE LIFE CYCLES GO, THERE
###239 ARE A LOT OF LIFE CYCLES THAT WERE PRESENTED IN THE READING THAT
###243 
###243 I DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IN LECTURE, FOR EXAMPLE, BROWN ALGAE AND
###247 DIFFERENT GROUPS. YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST FOR YOUR INFORMATION
###251 ONLY, NOT FOR, YOU KNOW, THE EXAM. BUT I DID SHOW THIS SLIDE.
###256 AND I WOULD LIKE YOU TO REMEMBER THE SORT OF GENERAL POINTS ABOUT
###261 LIFE CYCLES THAT, YOU KNOW THESE ARE, THESE ARE SEXUAL LIFE
###265 CYCLES WE TALKED ABOUT THAT INVOLVE MEIOSIS AND FERTILIZATION.
###269 AND IT'S THE RELATIVE TIMING OF THOSE TWO PROCESSES THAT
###272 DISTINGUISHES THESE MAJOR LIFE CYCLES, LIKE WHAT OCCURS IN US AND
###277 OTHER ANIMALS COMPARED TO WHAT HAPPENS IN PLANTS AND IN FUNGI.
###282 SO BE SURE TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH THIS MATERIAL. YOU KNOW KEEP
###287 IN MIND IT'S, WHETHER MITOSIS IS LIMITED TO ONE OF THE TWO PLOIDY
###293 STAGES IS CRITICAL TO INTERPRETING THESE LIFE CYCLES TOO. SO
###299 UNLIKE US, THE PLANTS HAVE MITOSIS GOING ON IN THIS HAPLOID PHASE
###306 AND IT ENDS UP, THEY END UP WITH A MULTICELLULAR BODY, YOU KNOW,
###312 A GAMETOPHYTE, A MULTICELLULAR ORGANISM THAT'S HAPLOID, SO THAT'S
###315 COMPLETELY ALIEN TO US AND OTHER ANIMALS BUT IT'S COMMON, OF
###318 COURSE, IN THE, ALL THE, COMMON TO ALL THE LAND PLANTS AND EVEN
###323 SOME OF THE GREEN ALGAE AND OTHER GROUPS WE DIDN'T REALLY TALK
###326 ABOUT. SO WERE THERE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE GENERAL LIFE CYCLE
###334 ISSUES HERE? SO THESE WERE THE FIVE MAJOR GROUPS OF FUNGI WE
###341 TALKED ABOUT. AND YOU KNOW I'M NOT LOOKING FOR A HUGE AMOUNT OF
###344 DETAIL HERE, JUST WHAT WAS MENTIONED IN THE CLASS WHICH WAS
###348 FAIRLY LIMITED. AND THE CHYTRIDS ARE THAT GROUP THAT STILL HAS
###351 SOME FLAGELLATED STAGES THAT CAN SWIM AROUND AS FAR AS THE SPORES
###355 AND GAMETES GO, WHICH IS UNUSUAL FOR, FOR THE FUNGI. AND
###360 
###360 THEY'RE THE SISTER TO ALL THE OTHER FUNGI. THEY'RE AN EARLY
###363 DIVERGING BRANCH. AND LIKE THE ZYGOMYCETES, THE ZYGOMYCOTA,
###370 THEY HAVE COENOCYTIC HYPHAE WHEN THEY HAVE HYPHAE. REMEMBER
###375 COENOCYTIC MEANING THAT THE NUCLEI AREN'T SEPARATED BY ANY
###378 PARTITIONS OR PARTIAL PARTITIONS IN THE, IN THE BODY OF THE, OF
###384 THE FILAMENTS OR THE MYCELIUM IN GENERAL. SAME GOES WITH THESE
###389 ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI. THEY'RE SO IMPORTANT WITH REGARD
###393 TO RELATIONSHIPS WITH PLANT ROOTS. AND IT'S THIS GROUP OF THE,
###398 THAT MAKES UP THE MOST OF THE FUNGI, THE ASCOMYCETES AND
###401 BASIDIOMYCETES WHERE WE SEE THE SEPTATE HYPHAE AND WHERE YOU GET
###408 THIS INTERESTING SITUATION WHERE PLASMOGAMY AND KARYOGAMY, THE
###416 FUSION OF THE CYTOPLASM AND THE FUSION OF THE NUCLEI IS DELAY-,
###420 ARE WIDELY SEPARATED IN TIME. AND YOU HAVE THIS DIKARYOTIC
###424 STAGE. REMEMBER WE HAVE TWO NUCLEI PER SEGMENT OF EACH HYPHA
###432 SEPARATED BY PARTITION, PARTIAL PARTITIONS. SO THIS IS
###436 SOMETHING WE JUST SAW IN THE FUNGI, RIGHT, JUST THESE HIGHER
###438 FUNGI WHERE WE HAVE THIS LIFE CYCLE WHICH IS OTHERWISE VERY
###445 SIMILAR TO, WELL, IT'S, IT HAS ONLY THE, THE ONLY DIPLOID STAGE
###453 IS THE ZYGOTE. BUT YOU HAVE THIS LONG PERIOD WHERE YOU HAVE THE
###457 FUSION OF THE CYTOPLASM PRIOR TO THE FUSION OF THE NUCLEI WHERE
###464 MUCH OF THE PLANT BODY, FOR EXAMPLE OF THE BASIDIOMYCETES, IS
###469 DIKARYOTIC LIKE YOU CAN SEE HERE WITH TWO NUCLEI PER PARTITION.
###477 AND THEN THEY PRODUCE THESE FRUITING BODIES WHERE YOU ACTUALLY
###480 GET THE FUSION OF THE NEW NUCLEI AND MEIOSIS OCCURRING RIGHT
###485 AFTER THAT TO PRODUCE SEXUAL SPORES. THOUGH THAT'S, AND THEN
###494 
###494 ALSO REMEMBER THAT IN THE FUNGI THERE ARE THESE, QUITE A WIDE
###499 DIVERSITY OF DIFFERENT GROUPS WHERE THERE'S NO, NO SEXUAL
###503 REPRODUCTION THAT'S BEEN DOCUMENTED. AND THESE HAVE BEEN PLACED
###507 IN THIS GROUP DEUTEROMYCOTA, THE SO-CALLED IMPERFECT FUNGI THAT
###512 DON'T HAVE ANY KNOWN SEXUAL PHASE. AND THESE ARE IMPORTANT IN
###517 MEDICINE ET CETERA. BUT THEY'RE, THEY'RE AN ARTIFICIAL GROUP IN
###521 A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF FUNGI. SO WE DID TALK ABOUT THIS
###524 GROUP AS WELL. AND I DID MENTION ALSO THE SLIME MOLDS AND THE
###530 WATER MOLDS WHICH AREN'T TRUE FUNGI BUT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY
###533 TREATED AS FUNGI. SO ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT FUNGI THAT ANYONE
###543 WANTED TO ASK? ALL RIGHT SO, OH, ONE OTHER THING ABOUT THE
###556 FUNGI. I'LL GET, MAYBE WE'LL GET TO IT LATER, BUT THEY HAVE A
###559 LOT OF INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER ORGANISMS, OF COURSE. AND YOU
###564 KNOW IN ADDITION TO BEING DECOMPOSERS, PARASITES AND SUCH, THEY
###567 CAN ALSO BE MUTUALISTS. WELL, THEY CAN BE IN ASSOCIATION,
###571 REGARDLESS OF THEIR MODE OF NUTRITION, THEY CAN BE IN ASSOCIATION
###574 WITH, WITH DIFFERENT ORGANISMS, LIKE ALGAE, GREEN ALGAE OR
###580 BLUE-GREEN ALGAE IN THE CASE OF LICHENS, THAT MUTUALISTIC
###585 ASSOCIATION THAT WE GET, IT'S IMPORTANT IN PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY
###591 IN ECOSYSTEMS. AND ALSO THE, THE MYCORRHIZAE. TALKED QUITE A
###598 LOT ABOUT THAT BOTH IN TERMS OF, IN FUNGAL LECTURES AND LATER ON
###601 IN TALKING ABOUT ROOTS. REMEMBER THE MYCORRHIZAE IS AN
###604 ASSOCIATION BETWEEN FUNGI AND PLANT ROOTS THAT IS IMPORTANT TO
###610 THE SUCCESS OF PLANTS. AND IT LOOKS LIKE THAT ESTABLISHMENT OF
###613 THAT RELATIONSHIP GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE EARLY, EARLIEST
###617 
###617 LAND PLANTS. AND SO THAT'S QUITE A, IT'S QUITE SUGGESTIVE THAT
###622 THE FUNGI WERE PRETTY IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF LAND PLANTS AND
###626 THEY VERY MUCH ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE, THE PRODUCTIVITY OF PLANTS
###633 TODAY. I MEAN A LOT OF PLANTS CAN SURVIVE WITHOUT THE
###635 MYCORRHIZAL ASSOCIATION BUT THEY DON'T DO NEARLY AS WELL AS THEY
###639 DO WITH IT. SO THAT'S ANOTHER THING TO KEEP IN MIND AS FAR AS
###643 FUNGI, THAT THEY, THEY HAVE REALLY IMPORTANT ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS.
###647 SO ANY ... ALL RIGHT, SO LET'S, SO THE ALGAE, WE SPENT QUITE A
###656 BIT OF TIME ON THE ALGAE GROUPS. AND REMEMBER THE ALGAE ARE NOT
###660 A NATURAL GROUP. THE FUNGI ARE A MONOPHYLETIC GROUP IF YOU
###663 THROW OUT THE WATER MOLDS, THE YELLOW MYCETES, AND THE SLIME
###668 MOLDS, AND PRETTY CLOSELY RELATED TO ANIMALS. BUT HERE THE
###674 CELLULAR SLIME MODELS AND THE PLASMODIAL ONES ARE CLOSELY
###677 RELATED. BUT REMEMBER THE ALGAE ARE SCATTERED. THE
###681 PHOTOSYNTHETIC ORGANISMS ARE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE TREE OF
###685 LIFE. THERE AREN'T ANY IN THE ARCHAEA. BUT WE DO HAVE, YOU KNOW
###691 CYANOBACTERIA REMEMBER WERE FUNDAMENTAL TO THE EVOLUTION OF
###695 PHOTOSYNTHESIS. THEY'RE THE ONES THAT REALLY EVOLVED
###698 PHOTOSYNTHESIS. AND IT'S THESE OTHER LINEAGES THAT JUST
###700 CAPTURED CYANOBACTERIA. AND REMEMBER THERE'S THIS, PUTATIVELY
###710 AT LEAST, WE CAN ONLY BE SURE OF ONE EVENT LIKE THAT THAT
###715 HAPPENED WHERE CYANOBACTERIUM WAS CAPTURED BY AN EARLY EUKARYOTE
###721 THROUGH PHAGOCYTOSIS, YOU KNOW BASICALLY JUST ENGULFING IT. AND
###727 THEN LATER WE GET THIS SPLIT BETWEEN THE GREEN ALGAE AND THE RED
###731 ALGAE FOLLOWED BY THE SECONDARY SYMBIOSES WHERE WE HAVE
###736 
###737 UNICELLULAR EUKARYOTES THAT ALREADY POSSESS A, A CYANOBACTERIUM
###744 OR PLASTID AT THIS POINT IN THEIR EVOLUTION THAT'S BEEN CAPTURED
###748 AND RECRUITED FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN THIS DIVERSE SET OF LINEAGES.
###751 SO ARE THERE QUESTIONS ABOUT ENDOSYMBIOSIS? NO? BE SURE TO
###764 STUDY THIS. I MEAN THIS IS REALLY, I MEAN PRETTY NOVEL
###767 INFORMATION. I MEAN NOT SO LONG AGO WE FOUND, YOU KNOW WE'VE
###770 BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT VARIOUS OF THESE LINEAGES REPRESENT
###774 CAPTURES OF EUKARYOTES. YEAH?
###779 STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
###783 PROFESSOR: SO THE RED ALGAE APPEARED TO, APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN
###788 THE ONE SECONDARY ENDOSYMBIOSIS THAT GAVE RISE TO THE, THE
###792 DINOFLAGELLATES WHICH, MANY OF WHICH ARE PHOTOSYNTHETIC. AND
###798 THEY'RE A BIG COMPONENT OF PHYTOPLANKTON RESPONSIBLE FOR RED
###804 TIDES. STRAMENOPILES ARE THE OTHER MAJOR GROUP. THE
###810 APICOMPLEXANS HAVE LOST THEIR ABILITY TO PHOTOSYNTHESIZE. THEY
###813 JUST HAVE A VESTIGIAL PLASTID, AND I DIDN'T MENTION THEM MUCH
###816 EXCEPT TO SAY THAT THE MALARIUM, THE MALARIAL ORGANISM IS IN THIS
###821 CLADE. BUT THE STRAMENOPILES INCLUDE THE BROWN ALGAE AND THE
###828 DIATOMS AND THE GOLDEN BROWNS. SO, YEAH, THERE ARE SEVERAL
###832 GROUPS OF PHOTOSYNTHETIC ALGAE WITHIN THAT GROUP WE CALL
###836 STRAMENOPILES, WHICH ALSO INCLUDE SOME NON-PHOTOSYNTHETIC GROUPS
###840 THAT PRESUMABLY LOST THEIR ABILITY TO PHOTOSYNTHESIZE, LIKE THE
###843 OOMYCETES, THOSE WATER MOLDS THAT USED TO BE THOUGHT TO BE FUNGI.
###848 ALL RIGHT, SO THEN, SO IN ADDITION TO UNDERSTANDING ENDOSYMBIOSIS
###861 IN TERMS OF THIS, I'D REALLY LIKE YOU TO STUDY, I PRESENTED
###864 
###864 SEVERAL SLIDES ON, ON THE EVIDENCE FOR, FOR ENDOSYMBIOSIS.
###870 REMEMBER THERE'S A WHOLE SERIES OF, OF DIFFERENT LINES OF
###874 EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT I PRESENTED. AND SO
###880 YOU SHOULD FOCUS ON THAT DATA TOO IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT,
###887 WHAT'S REALLY BEHIND THE HYPOTHESIS IN TERMS OF, OF EVIDENCE,
###891 OKAY. ALL RIGHT, SO THE ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS THEN IS THE
###902 MAIN LIFE CYCLE WE FOCUSED ON AFTER WE GOT TO LAND PLANTS. ALL
###906 THE LAND PLANTS HAVE THIS. AND AGAIN, WE HAVE BOTH
###913 MULTICELLULAR DIPLOID ORGANISM AND A MULTICELLULAR HAPLOID
###916 ORGANISM. HAVING A MULTICELLULAR, HAVING BOTH HAPLOID AND
###921 DIPLOID MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS IS DIAGNOSTIC OF THIS TYPE OF
###926 LIFE CYCLE, THIS ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS. REMEMBER AN ANIMAL
###929 LIFE CYCLE, THE ONLY HAPLOID PHASE IS THE GAMETE. IT'S NOT A
###935 MULTICELLULAR ORGANISM. AND IN THE FUNGI THE ONLY TRULY DIPLOID
###940 STAGE IS THE ZYGOTE. THAT'S NOT MULTICELLULAR. WE HAVE MEIOSIS
###944 RIGHT AFTER THAT. SO THIS IS THE, THE MAIN LIFE CYCLE WE FOCUSED
###949 ON FOR ALL THE LAND PLANTS, ESPECIALLY. AND I SHOWED YOU THIS
###960 EXAMPLE, IT'S A BIT OF AN ASIDE IN TERMS OF THE ORGANISM, BUT
###963 JUST TO POINT OUT THAT THERE ARE ORGANISMS LIKE SEA LETTUCE WHICH
###967 IS A GREEN ALGAE WHERE YOU HAVE VERY SIMILAR HAPLOID AND DIPLOID
###972 PHASES. AND I MAINLY SHOWED YOU THIS EXAMPLE JUST TO MAKE IT A
###976 LITTLE EASIER TO UNDERSTAND THIS ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS
###979 BECAUSE IN THE LAND PLANTS EITHER ONE PHASE OR THE OTHER IS SO
###983 HIGHLY REDUCED, THE GAMETOPHYTE OR SPOROPHYTE, THAT IT'S OFTEN
###988 HARD TO KIND OF PICTURE THOSE AS DISTINCT ORGANISMS, BUT THEY
###992 
###992 ARE. AND SO REMEMBER THE SPOROPHYTE IS THE SPORE PRODUCING
###997 PLANT. SPORES ARE PRODUCED BY MEIOSIS. WE GO FROM DIPLOID TO
###1002 HAPLOID HERE. BUT UNLIKE IN AN ANIMAL WHERE AFTER MEIOSIS WE
###1006 HAVE GAMETES, HERE WE HAVE SPORES. AND SPORES UNLIKE GAMETES DO
###1009 NOT FUSE WITH ONE ANOTHER. THEY GERMINATE TO CREATE AND UNDERGO
###1015 MITOSES TO PRODUCE A HAPLOID GAMETOPHYTE. AND SO IN THIS CASE
###1023 THEN WE'RE PRODUCING GAMETES BY MITOSIS RATHER THAN MEIOSIS.
###1027 THE MEIOSIS OCCURRED BACK HERE. THAT'S TOTALLY UNLIKE US IN
###1031 THAT SENSE. THOUGH THE GAMETES ARE GENETICALLY IDENTICAL TO THE
###1036 GAMETOPHYTE. AND THEN WE HAVE THE FUSION OF THE GAMETES AND
###1041 THEN THE FORMATION OF THE ZYGOTE AND THE DIPLOID SPOROPHYTE. SO
###1052 THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER TOO THAT THE LAND PLANTS ARE
###1056 INTIMATELY RELATED TO THE GREEN ALGAE. SO THE GREEN, WHAT WE
###1059 CAUSED TO CALL GREEN ALGAE AND WHAT WE STILL DO TODAY LOOSELY IS
###1063 A PARAPHYLETIC GROUP. IT'S NOT MONOPHYLETIC. SOME OF THE GREEN
###1067 ALGAE ARE MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO THE LAND PLANTS THAN THEY ARE
###1069 TO OTHER GREEN ALGAE, OKAY. AND REMEMBER THESE ARE FRESHWATER
###1076 GREEN ALGAE. SO THE LAND PLANTS DIDN'T COME OUT OF THE OCEAN.
###1079 THEY DIDN'T DESCEND FROM SOME MARINE FORM DIRECTLY. THE CONQUEST
###1084 OF LAND WAS VIA WATER INTO THE FRESHWATER AND THEN TO LAND. SO
###1089 IT'S A STEP-WISE PROCESS IT APPEARS. ALL RIGHT? OKAY, AND SO
###1101 THEN WE TALKED ABOUT THESE MAJOR SEVEN GROUPS OF VASCULAR PLANTS.
###1107 AND THREE OF THEM ARE CONSIDERED BRYOPHYTES EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT
###1110 A MONOPHYLETIC GROUP. THEY'RE A GRADE OF LINEAGES, THE MOSSES,
###1114 HORNWORTS, AND LIVERWORTS THAT I MENTIONED THAT, THAT HAVE A
###1120 
###1120 SUBSET OF THE FEATURES THAT WE, SUBSET OF ADAPTATIONS TO LAND
###1125 THAT WE SEE IN THE VASCULAR PLANTS BUT NOT ALL OF THEM. SO AND
###1133 THE MAIN THINGS THAT WE FOCUSED ON AS FAR AS -- THOUGH THE
###1142 FRESHWATER GREEN ALGAE, REMEMBER THEY, EVEN THOUGH THE SEA
###1146 LETTUCE WHICH IS A MARINE ALGA HAS THAT ALTERNATION OF
###1150 GENERATIONS, THE CLOSEST RELATIVES OF LAND PLANTS DO NOT HAVE AN
###1155 ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS. THEIR ONLY DIPLOID PHASE IS A
###1159 ZYGOTE. SO THEY JUST HAVE, ESSENTIALLY THEY JUST HAVE A
###1164 GAMETOPHYTE. THEY JUST HAVE A HAPLOID PHASE. AND THEN WE SEE
###1168 THE INTERJECTION OF A SPOROPHYTE IN THE BRYOPHYTES. SO THESE DO
###1172 HAVE A SPOROPHYTE, BUT IT'S HIGHLY REDUCED. BUT THE MAIN PLANT
###1176 BODY IS HAPLOID. IT'S A GAMETOPHYTE. AND SO BASED ON THIS
###1181 RELATIONSHIP HERE, THE FACT THAT THIS IS PARAPHYLETIC RELATIVE TO
###1186 THE VASCULAR PLANTS, IT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THE FEATURES SHARED
###1190 BY THESE TAXA WERE ANCESTRAL FOR ALL LAND PLANTS. OKAY, SO THE
###1196 BRYOPHYTES PROVIDE US WITH SOME REAL CLUES TO WHAT THE ORIGINAL
###1200 LAND PLANT WAS LIKE AND THE FEATURES THESE LINEAGES SHARE WAS
###1204 LIKELY ANCESTRAL. SO THE GAMETOPHYTE BEING DOMINANT AND THE
###1209 SPOROPHYTE BEING JUST PARASITIC AND CONNECTED TO THE GAMETOPHYTE
###1214 THROUGHOUT ITS LIFE, THAT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ANCESTRAL IN THE
###1217 LAND PLANTS. AND THESE ARE FREE-SPORING PLANTS. THESE ARE NOT
###1224 SEED PLANTS. REMEMBER THE SEED PLANTS ARE ONLY DOWN HERE. AND
###1229 HERE WE HAVE THE MOSS LIFE CYCLE. SO AGAIN, WE HAVE A HAPLOID
###1235 PHASE AND A DIPLOID PHASE. BUT THIS DIPLOID PHASE EVEN THOUGH
###1239 THIS MAKES IT LOOK FAIRLY EXTENSIVE, IT'S JUST THIS PARASITIC
###1242 
###1243 VERY HIGHLY, YOU KNOW, VERY MINOR ORGANISM THAT'S PARASITIC ON
###1249 THE PHOTOSYNTHETIC GAMETOPHYTE BY THIS FOOT HERE. IT'S JUST
###1252 BASICALLY JUST A SPORANGIUM ON A STALK. SO IT'S PRETTY MINIMAL
###1256 AS FAR AS AN ORGANISM GOES, BUT IT IS A MULTICELLULAR ORGANISM.
###1260 AND IT'S GENETICALLY DISTINCT FROM THIS GAMETOPHYTE. OKAY. SO
###1270 THAT'S THE, THE MOSS LIFE CYCLE. ARE THERE QUESTIONS ABOUT
###1275 BRYOPHYTES OR -- YEAH?
###1277 STUDENT: SO [INAUDIBLE]
###1278 PROFESSOR: YEAH, I'M GOING TO GET TO THAT IN JUST A MINUTE.
###1283 BUT, BUT IT'S A WORTHWHILE POINT TO MAKE HERE TOO. IT'S GOOD
###1286 THAT YOU SAID THAT BECAUSE IN THIS PARTICULAR EXAMPLE FROM THE
###1291 BOOK, YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE, THERE IS IN THIS CASE WE HAVE SEP-,
###1299 WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF GAMETOPHYTES, A FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE
###1303 AND A MALE GAMETOPHYTE. SOME MOSSES DO SHOW THAT SORT OF
###1309 DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THEIR GAMETOPHYTES WHERE THEY HAVE MALE
###1312 AND FEMALE GAMETOPHYTES. BUT THE SPORE SIZES REMAIN THE SAME,
###1316 AND THEY DON'T HAVE DISTINCTIVE SPORANGIA THAT PRODUCE A
###1320 MEGASPORE THAT GERMINATES TO BE THE FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE AND A
###1323 SMALLER MICROSPORE THAT GERMINATES TO BE THE MALE GAMETOPHYTE.
###1327 SO THAT, THAT CONCEPT OF HETEROSPORY IS GENERALLY DISCUSSED ONLY
###1332 IN, IN THE CONTEXT OF, OF VASCULAR PLANTS NOT THE BRYOPHYTES.
###1337 BUT NONETHELESS ONE OF THE MAIN DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN
###1339 HETEROSPOROUS AND HOMOSPOROUS VASCULAR PLANTS IS THAT IN
###1343 HETEROSPOROUS VASCULAR PLANTS YOU HAVE UNISEXUAL GAMETOPHYTES.
###1346 YOU HAVE MALE GAMETOPHYTES THAT PRODUCE SPERM AND YOU HAVE FEMALE
###1351 
###1351 GAMETOPHYTES THAT PRODUCE EGGS. YOU DON'T HAVE BISEXUAL
###1355 GAMETOPHYTES THAT PRODUCE BOTH. OKAY, SO THAT'S, AND THAT'S
###1359 GOING ON HERE IN THIS PARTICULAR MOSS. BUT SOME MOSSES DO IT
###1362 THIS WAY, AND SOME MOSSES HAVE BISEXUAL GAMETOPHYTES. YEAH?
###1367 STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
###1370 PROFESSOR: HERE THEY CAN BE TO SOME EXTENT, YEAH. SO THAT CAN
###1375 BE TRUE IN BRYOPHYTES. IT'S A RELATIVELY MINOR AMOUNT OF
###1379 PHOTOSYNTHATE THEY PRODUCE COMPARED TO WHAT, WHAT THE
###1382 GAMETOPHYTES PRODUCE. BUT, YEAH, THAT'S TRUE. IN FACT, SOME OF
###1385 THEM HAVE STOMATA. SO THERE ARE SOME BRYOPHYTES, NOT, NOT
###1388 LIVERWORTS, BUT THERE ARE SOME SPOROPHYTES THAT PRODUCE, MOSSES
###1393 AND HORNWORTS THAT PRODUCE STOMATA. SO THAT'S, THAT'S AN
###1398 INTERESTING SITUATION TOO. YEAH?
###1405 STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
###1409 PROFESSOR: SORRY?
###1412 STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
###1416 PROFESSOR: OH, NO, NOT THE DATES. BUT IT SHOULD, ONE THING
###1424 THAT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THOUGH IS THAT IT'S CLEAR THAT THE
###1427 BRYOPHYTES, BASICALLY THE BRYOPHYTE LINEAGE FOLLOWS THIS, IF YOU
###1432 FOLLOW THE MAIN BACKBONE OF THIS LAND PLANT PHYLOGENY, THE
###1440 BRYOPHYTES ARE EARLY BRANCHING HERE. SO YOU KNOW THE ORGANISMS
###1444 THAT EXISTED THROUGH THIS PART OF THE TREE WOULD HAVE SHARED THE
###1446 FEATURES THAT ALL OF THESE THREE GROUPS HAVE. THOUGH THE
###1451 BRYOPHYTE BIOLOGY WAS IN PLACE HERE PRIOR TO THE, THE VASCULAR
###1457 PLANT BIOLOGY, THE DISTINGUISHING FEATURES OF THE VASCULAR
###1460 
###1460 PLANTS. THOUGH THE SPOROPHYTE DOMINANCE DOESN'T COME INTO PLAY
###1464 UNTIL AFTER, SOMEWHERE ALONG THIS BRANCH. OKAY. REMEMBER I
###1471 DID POINT OUT THAT THERE WAS, THERE ARE SOME FOSSIL VASCULAR
###1474 PLANTS THAT ARE, WOULD BE SOMEWHERE ALONG THIS BRANCH THAT HAVE
###1477 ISOMORPHIC ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS WHERE THE GAMETOPHYTE AND
###1480 AND THE SPOROPHYTE LOOK THE SAME. SO THERE'S A TRANSITIONAL
###1484 FOSSIL BETWEEN GAMETOPHYTE DOMINANCE AND SPOROPHYTE DOMINANCE,
###1488 BUT NONE OF THOSE PLANTS ARE STILL EXTANT. THEY'RE WAY BACK IN
###1492 THE PALEOZOIC. ALL RIGHT, AND THIS IS JUST, YOU SAW THIS
###1506 EARLIER. THIS IS JUST REITERATING THE POINT THAT I ALREADY MADE
###1510 THAT YOU KNOW THE LAND PLANTS HAVE BOTH MULTICELLULAR HAPLOID AND
###1515 DIPLOID GENERATIONS, WHEREAS THAT'S NOT TRUE FOR FUNGI AND
###1520 ANIMALS. THEY HAVE ONE OR THE OTHER. OKAY, THEN WE GOT INTO
###1528 THE, INTO THE VASCULAR PLANTS. THE FERN LIFE CYCLE IS THE FIRST
###1536 ONE WE TALKED ABOUT. AND IN THINKING ABOUT ALL OF THIS, YOU
###1542 SHOULD ALSO BE, AS YOU GO THROUGH THE NOTES, THINK ABOUT THE
###1548 FEATURES THAT, THAT WE SEE HAP-, COMING INTO PLACE WITHIN THE,
###1553 THE LAND PLANT PHYLOGENY THAT HAVE POTENTIAL VALUE FOR LIFE ON
###1561 LAND. THOUGH, YOU KNOW, THINGS LIKE A CUTICLE, AND I'LL GO
###1565 THROUGH SOME OF THOSE IN A MINUTE, BUT JUST I WANT TO MAKE THAT
###1568 POINT NOW SINCE WE'RE GETTING INTO LAND PLANTS MORE THAT THIS
###1572 THEME OF LIFE ON LAND, YOU KNOW, KEEP THAT IN MIND AS, AS YOU'RE
###1575 STUDYING. AND THERE'S A, THERE'S A DIAGRAM I'LL SHOW YOU IN A
###1581 MINUTE THAT'S HELPFUL WITH REGARD TO THAT. BUT THE FERN LIFE
###1585 CYCLE THEN IS ONE WHERE, IS THE FIRST ONE WE LOOKED AT WHERE THE
###1588 
###1588 SPOROPHYTE IS DOMINANT. AND I SPENT A LITTLE TIME TALKING ABOUT
###1593 THE, THE FERN MORPHOLOGY. SO REMEMBER IN FERNS THE AERIAL PART,
###1599 THE PART THAT'S ACTUALLY ABOVE GROUND IS, IS USUALLY JUST THE
###1602 LEAVES. AND THE MAIN PART OF THE PLANT UNDERGROUND IS THE STEM
###1607 AND THE ROOTS. SO THE STEMS ARE TYPICALLY HORIZONTAL EXCEPT IN
###1611 THE TREE FERNS WHICH ARE A PRETTY MINOR GROUP OVERALL IN TERMS OF
###1615 DIVERSITY. AND ALSO WE TALKED ABOUT HOW THE SPORANGIA ARE BORNE
###1621 ON THESE UNDERSIDES OF THE LEAVES IN THESE STRUCTURES CALLED SORI
###1626 THAT ARE CLUSTERS OF SPORANGIA. AND THEN THE SPORANGIA THEN
###1630 PRODUCE SPORES. SO I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO KEEP IN MIND THE,
###1635 THE SCALE HERE, YOU KNOW, IN TERMS OF WHAT THE, YOU KNOW, SPORES
###1639 ARE INSIDE SPORANGIA. SPORANGIA ARE INSIDE SORI. YOU KNOW
###1644 SORI ARE ON THE LEAVES. I MEAN YOU SHOULD HAVE SOME SENSE OF
###1647 THE OVERALL SCALE OR THE SIZE OF THESE THINGS RELATIVE TO ONE
###1649 ANOTHER, AND, YOU KNOW, REALIZE THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S SORT OF A
###1655 BASIC POINT. BUT, I KNOW IT'S EASY TO GET CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT'S
###1659 A SPORE, WHAT'S A SPORANGIUM. BUT YOU KNOW THE SPORANGIUM IS A
###1663 MULTICELLULAR SAC THAT BEARS SPORES, AS A GAMETANGIUM IS A
###1668 MULTICELLULAR SAC THAT BEARS GAMETES ON THE GAMETOPHYTE. AND
###1673 THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF GAMETANGIA. THE ANTHERIDIUM THAT
###1677 PRODUCES SPERM AND THE ARCHEGONIUM THAT PRODUCES EGGS. I MEAN
###1682 THAT'S SOME BASIC TERMINOLOGY THAT, THAT APPLIES ACROSS, ACROSS
###1686 THESE GROUPS THAT, THAT YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF, YOU KNOW AND
###1689 SHOULD BE FAMILIAR WITH. AND SOMETHING LIKE SORUS YOU KNOW OR
###1696 SORI, THAT'S, THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH FEATURE THAT YOU KNOW I
###1699 
###1700 WOULD EXPECT YOU TO REMEMBER THAT. BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT
###1704 OF THIS TERMINOLOGY COMES UP AGAIN AND AGAIN. THERE'S A LITTLE
###1708 BIT OF SPECIFIC TERMINOLOGY IN THE FERNS THAT, THAT I THINK, YOU
###1711 KNOW THAT I FOCUSED ON THAT'S WORTH REMEMBERING. QUESTIONS
###1715 ABOUT FERNS? YEAH?
###1718 STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]. WHAT IS THE FUNCTION OF RHIZOIDS?
###1724 PROFESSOR: OH, RHIZOIDS. WELL, THEY CAN SERVE TO ANCHOR A
###1732 PLANT TO THE, TO THEIR SUBSTRATE. THEY'RE NOT SO FUNCTIONAL IN
###1738 ABSORPTION AS A ROOT. ROOTS COME INTO PLAY, THAT'S ONE OF THE
###1744 THINGS I MENTIONED IN TERMS OF ADAPTATIONS TO LAND IN THE, IN THE
###1748 VASCULAR PLANTS WE HAVE THE EVALUATION OF ROOTS. WE DON'T SEE
###1751 THOSE IN THE BRYOPHYTES. WE JUST HAVE RHIZOIDS. AND IN THE
###1756 FERN GAMETOPHYTE WE HAVE RHIZOIDS TOO, BUT NOT IN THE SPOROPHYTE.
###1761 BUT, YEAH, THEY'RE, THEY MAINLY HAVE AN ANCHORAGE FUNCTION, NOT
###1764 SO MUCH AN ABSORPTION FUNCTION. THOUGH GAMETOPHYTES CAN ABSORB
###1770 MOISTURE RIGHT THROUGH THEIR, THROUGH THE MAIN BODY OF THE
###1774 PHALLUS AS IN A BRYOPHYTE. SO HERE'S HETEROSPORY AGAIN. AND
###1784 THIS OCCURS REMEMBER IN THE LYCOPHYTES AND SOME OF THEM, THAT'S
###1787 WHAT THIS IS, IS A LYCOPHYTE CONE FROM THE SELAGINELLA WHERE YOU
###1792 CAN SEE MEGASPORES ON THE LEFT AND MICROSPORES ON THE RIGHT IN
###1796 THESE, IN A MICROSPORANGIUM AND A MEGASPORANGIUM. SO AGAIN,
###1803 THESE ARE SPORES PRODUCED BY MEIOSIS FROM THE SPOROPHYTE, BUT IT
###1807 JUST SO HAPPENS THE SPOROPHYTE PRODUCES TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF
###1809 SPORES IN DIFFERENT SPORANGIA. AND THESE GERMINATE TO BE FEMALE
###1815 GAMETOPHYTES AND THESE GERMINATE TO BE MALE GAMETOPHYTES. SO WE
###1819 
###1819 HAVE A SEPARATION OF FUNCTION HERE. LESS CHANCE FOR SELFING.
###1824 AND IN ALL THESE ORGANISMS THAT HAVE THIS UNISEXUAL GAMETOPHYTE,
###1831 YOU HAVE GERMINATION OR YOU HAVE THE MULTICELLULAR GAMETOPHYTE
###1835 LIVING WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE SPORE WALL. SO THEY, THEY CAN
###1840 EMERGE TO SOME EXTENT LIKE THE POLLEN TUBE YOU KNOW THAT GROWS
###1844 OUT OF IN THE CASE OF SEED PLANTS, THE POLLEN YOU KNOW EMERGES AS
###1848 A TUBE. BUT FOR THE MOST PART THERE'S, THERE'S CONTAINMENT
###1853 WITHIN THIS SPORE WALL FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. SO THE, THE
###1859 HETEROSPOROUS ORGANISMS WHICH INCLUDED SOME LYCOPHYTES, A VERY
###1863 SMALL NUMBER OF FERNS WHICH WE DIDN'T FOCUS ON AT ALL OR IT'S NOT
###1867 REALLY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER BUT THE WATER FERNS, AND ALL OF THE
###1871 SEED PLANTS. ALL THE SEED PLANTS ARE HETEROSPOROUS. IN THOSE
###1875 WE GET THIS DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THE SPORE TO SOME EXTENT. ARE
###1881 THERE QUESTIONS ABOUT HETEROSPORY THEN? YEAH?
###1885 STUDENT: ARE ALL THE HETEROSPOROUS [INAUDIBLE]
###1893 PROFESSOR: NO, THEY DON'T. THEY DON'T HAVE ALL STROBILI. BUT
###1899 THE ONES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT DO. BECAUSE WE JUST, REALLY THE
###1903 ONLY HETEROSPOROUS PLANTS WE REALLY FOCUSED ON MUCH WERE, WERE
###1908 GYMNO- WERE IN THE SEED PLANTS. I DID MENTION SELAGINELLA IN
###1915 THE LYCOPHYTES, THESE MOSS-LIKE PLANTS WHICH THIS IS. AND THIS
###1919 DOES HAVE A STROBILUS. BUT THERE'S, THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED
###1922 QUILLWORTS THAT WE DIDN'T GET INTO, THESE ISOETES THAT DON'T HAVE
###1926 STROBILI. AND THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE LARGEST OF ALL MEGASPORES.
###1930 YOU CAN SEE THEM WITH YOUR NAKED EYE PRETTY WELL. BUT, BUT YEAH
###1937 THAT, OFTENTIMES YOU DO HAVE, GENERALLY YOU HAVE STROBILI OR
###1940 
###1940 CONES. SO SEED PLANTS THEN,
###1957 SO IN THE CASE OF, WE WENT INTO THE
###1959 PINE LIFE CYCLE, AN EXAMPLE OF A GYMNOSPERM LIFE CYCLE. SO
###1964 REMEMBER WE'RE SEEING THIS TREND IN THE LAND PLANTS FROM, THAT'S
###1970 BASICALLY, OR AT LEAST IN THE WAY THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT THESE
###1972 GROUPS, WE'RE SEEING PROGRESSIVE REDUCTION OF THE GAMETOPHYTE
###1977 GENERATION AND INCREASING DOMINANCE OF THE SPOROPHYTE GENERATION.
###1984 AND IN THE CASE OF THE SEED PLANTS THEN, THE GAMETOPHYTES
###1991 REPRESENT THE POLLEN IN THE CASE OF THE MALE GAMETOPHYTE, SO THE
###1993 POLLEN IS THE MALE GAMETOPHYTE. AND IT'S DISPERSED IN AN
###1998 IMMATURE STAGE, BUT IT'S ALREADY UNDERGONE AT LEAST ONE MITOTIC
###2004 DIVISION BEFORE IT'S DISPERSED FROM THE MICROSPORANGIA OR THE
###2008 POLLEN SACS. AND, AND THEN THE MEGAGAMETOPHYTE REMEMBER IS
###2013 CONTAINED WITHIN THE OVULE. SO THE OVULE, THE IMMATURE SEED IS
###2019 THE HOME OF THE FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE AND IT NEVER LEAVES THAT, THAT
###2022 SITE. SO IT'S NEVER SHED FROM THE MEGASPORANGIUM WHICH IS ALSO
###2028 CONTAINED WITHIN THE OVULE. THE OVULE IN ITS EARLIEST STAGE
###2031 REMEMBER IS JUST A MEGASPORANGIUM WITH INTEGUMENT AROUND IT WHICH
###2035 IS A NOVEL STRUCTURE THAT BECOMES THE SEED COAT. IT DOESN'T
###2040 HAVE A HOMOLOGUE IN THE, WE'RE CLEAR ABOUT AT LEAST IN THESE
###2044 OTHER, IN THE NON-SEED PLANTS. AND WENT THROUGH THE STAGES OF
###2057 POLLINATION AND FERTILIZATION AND, IN THE CONIFER, IN THE PINE.
###2063 SO REMEMBER POLLINATION IN THE GYMNOSPERMS MEANS THE POLLEN IS
###2068 ACTUALLY LANDING AT THE MICROPYLAR OPENING INTO THE OVULE. THIS
###2073 IS DIFFERENT REMEMBER THAN IN FLOWERING PLANTS. WE'LL GET TO
###2076 BACK IN A MINUTE. BUT HERE POLLINATION MEANS THE POLLEN HAS TO
###2080 
###2080 ARRIVE AT THE OVULE ITSELF, SO RIGHT AT THE DOORSTEP OF THE
###2083 FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE, THOUGH IT HAS TO GET TO THIS POINT INTO THE
###2088 POLLEN CHAMBER AND THEN THE POLLEN TUBE GERMINATES, WE GET MORE
###2092 MITOTIC DIVISION, AND GROWS DOWN TO THE EGG INSIDE THE
###2098 ARCHEGONIUM. OKAY. AND THEN WE'VE ULTIMATELY HAVE
###2106 GERMINATION, OR WE HAVE, SORRY, WE HAVE THE FERTILIZATION OF THE
###2110 EGG. AND REMEMBER THERE'S JUST ONE FERTILIZATION EVENT IN THE
###2116 CONIFERS IN THE SEED, IN THE PINES. AND THEN WE ULTIMATELY GET
###2120 THE EMBRYO DEVELOPING INSIDE HERE. SO REMEMBER THERE ARE
###2124 EMBRYOS IN ALL OF THE LAND PLANTS. IT'S IN THE SEED PLANTS
###2128 WHERE THE EMBRYO HAS THIS LONG DORMANT PHASE OR LONG INACTIVE
###2134 PHASE WHERE THE SEED BECOMES DESICCATED. AND REMEMBER I
###2141 MENTIONED IN THE LAST LECTURE THAT ABA, ABSCISIC ACID, IS
###2144 INVOLVED IN PREPARING THE SEED FOR THAT. BUT IN ANY CASE WE
###2148 HAVE THREE GENERATIONS OF TISSUE HERE. WE'VE GOT THE ORIGINAL
###2152 PARENT SPOROPHYTE, THE DIPLOID TISSUE ON THE OUTSIDE. WE HAVE
###2156 THE HAPLOID FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE TISSUE. THAT'S THE NUTRITIVE
###2160 TISSUE FOR THE EMBRYO WHICH IS THE NEXT GENERATION OF DIPLOID
###2164 SPOROPHYTE. THOUGH DIPLOID, HAPLOID, DIPLOID, THREE GENERATIONS
###2170 OF TISSUE THERE IN THE PINE. ARE THERE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS?
###2177 THIS DOESN'T REQUIRE FREESTANDING WATER. WE HAVE VERY, MUCH
###2182 MORE SHELTERING OF THE GAMETOPHYTES FROM THE ENVIRONMENT. AND
###2187 WE HAVE A LOT OF PROTECTION PROVIDED NOW TO THE FEMALE
###2190 GAMETOPHYTE AND TO THE SUBSEQUENT SPOROPHYTE GENERATION AS WELL
###2194 AS DISPERSAL PROTECTION DURING DISPERSAL FROM THE PARENT
###2199 
###2199 SPOROPHYTE. OKAY, ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT? SO NOW TO THE
###2205 FLOWERING PLANTS. SO REMEMBER THE FLOWERING PLANTS, ON THE
###2210 FLOWER IS BASICALLY A STROBILUS OR A CONE, A CONE. AND ONE OF
###2219 THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURES OF THE FLOWERING PLANTS
###2222 DIFFERENTIATING THEM FROM THE GYMNOSPERMS IS THE CARPEL OR THE
###2228 PRESENCE OF A PISTOL COMPRISED OF ONE OR MORE CARPELS WHICH ARE
###2232 BASICALLY LEAVES THAT HAVE FUSED ALONG THEIR MARGIN TO PRODUCE A
###2237 CHAMBER IN WHICH THE OVULES ARE CONTAINED. SO THE OVULES ARE
###2241 PROTECTED FROM THE ENVIRONMENT. POLLINATION INVOLVES
###2244 GERMINATION OF THE POLLEN AWAY FROM THE OVULES ON THE STIGMA.
###2249 AND THEN WE HAVE A LOT MORE FEMALE SELECTIVITY HERE IN TERMS OF
###2253 OR AT LEAST PARENTAL SELECTIVITY ON THE PART OF THE PARENT OF
###2257 THESE FEMALE GAMETOPHYTES WITH REGARD TO POLLEN, PARENT OF THOSE
###2263 GAMETOPHYTE, MALE PARENT, OR MALE MATE FOR THESE FEMALE
###2268 GAMETOPHYTES, AND ALSO COMPETITION BETWEEN THE MALES HERE GROWING
###2276 DOWN THROUGH THE STYLE. OKAY, SO THAT, THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN
###2283 THINGS I WANTED TO MENTION ABOUT. AND REMEMBER THE CARPEL
###2286 DEVELOPS, OR THE PISTIL OR THE CARPEL DEVELOPS INTO FRUIT WHICH
###2290 IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT FEATURE OF ANGIOSPERMS IN TERMS OF
###2293 DISPERSAL. THE MATURE OVARY, AND SOMETIMES OTHER PARTS,
###2298 ACCESSORY TISSUES OF ONE OR MORE FLOWERS BECOMES A DISPERSAL UNIT
###2303 OFTENTIMES. ALL RIGHT. AND I JUST MENTIONED THEN POLLINATION
###2311 IN FLOWERING PLANTS INVOLVING SOME SORT OF ATTRACTANT OR
###2315 ADVERTISEMENT. SO REMEMBER POLLINATION INVOLVES A, MINIMALLY AN
###2318 ATTRACTANT OR AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR A POLLINATOR, IF IT'S ANIMAL
###2323 
###2323 POLLINATION. THERE IS WIND POLLINATION IN ANGIOSPERMS. IT'S
###2326 DERIVED FROM, FROM ANIMAL POLLINATION. BUT WHERE WE DO GET
###2332 BIOTIC OR ANIMAL POLLINATION THERE'S AN ATTRACTANT. AND
###2335 SOMETIMES THERE'S A REWARD, BUT NOT ALWAYS. I TALKED ABOUT
###2338 DECEIT POLLINATION WITH FLY POLLINATION AND THE BEE ORCHIDS AND
###2343 THERE ARE SOME OTHER EXAMPLES TOO. BUT USUALLY THERE'S A REWARD
###2347 OF SOME KIND. AND REMEMBER I SPENT SOME TIME TALKING ABOUT
###2351 DIFFERENT POLLINATION SYNDROMES THAT, WHERE THERE SEEMS TO HAVE
###2354 BEEN CO-EVOLUTION OR AT LEAST ON THE SITE OF THE PLANT WITH
###2359 REGARD TO DIFFERENT KINDS OF POLLINATORS. SO YOU SHOULD STUDY
###2362 THOSE TOO, THOSE POLLINATION SYNDROMES, FOR EXAMPLE LIKE FLY
###2367 POLLINATION, BEE POLLINATION, THAT SORT OF THING. QUESTIONS ON
###2374 ANY OF THAT? ALL RIGHT, AND THEN AGAIN, THE MALE GAMETOPHYTE AND
###2382 FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE EVEN BECOMING MORE REDUCED IN THE FLOWERING
###2385 PLANTS THAN IN THE, THAN IN THE CONIFERS. SO THE POLLEN OF, OF
###2391 ANGIOSPERMS, FLOWERING PLANTS IS ONLY COMPRISED OF TWO CELLS AT
###2398 THE TIME OF, OF DISPERSAL. AND THEN LATER THE GENERATIVE CELL
###2403 UNDERGOES MITOSIS TO GIVE RISE TO TWO SPERMS. SO WE JUST HAVE
###2408 THE BARE MINIMUM NUMBER OF CELLS TO MAKE THIS THING WORK AS AN
###2412 ORGANISM TO GROW THE POLLEN TUBE AND, AND TO FERTILIZE BOTH THE
###2419 EGG AND, THE OTHER SPERM REMEMBER FUSES WITH THE TWO POLAR NUCLEI
###2427 OF THE FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE THAT BECOME THE ENDOSPERM, THE
###2431 NUTRITIVE TISSUE. SO THE ANGIOSPERMS WAIT TO INVEST IN THEIR
###2435 NUTRITIVE TISSUE UNTIL AFTER FERTILIZATION HAS HAPPENED. SO
###2438 THAT'S A REALLY, PROBABLY A VERY IMPORTANT INNOVATION IN TERMS
###2441 
###2445 OF, OF YOU KNOW CONSERVING RESOURCES UNTIL THEY'RE NEEDED. SO,
###2448 THAT'S A POINT ABOUT REWARD AND POLLINATION. AND AGAIN THE
###2459 FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE HIGHLY REDUCED BY COMPARISON WITH THE CONIFER
###2464 OR THE PINE FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE. JUST A FEW CELLS, TYPICALLY
###2469 ABOUT SEVEN AND EIGHT NUCLEI. AGAIN THOSE TWO POLAR NUCLEI HERE
###2477 UNDERGO FUSION WITH ONE OF THE SPERM TO PRODUCE THE ENDOSPERM
###2480 MOTHER CELL THAT GOES ON TO UNDERGO MITOSES TO GIVE RISE TO
###2484 TRIPLOID. AND THIS IS TRIPLOID TISSUE. NOT DIPLOID OR HAPLOID
###2489 BUT 3N BECAUSE TWO NUCLEI OF THE FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE FUSED WITH
###2495 ONE OF THE SPERM. SO YOU GET THREE GENOMES TOGETHER HERE. AND
###2500 THAT NOURISHES THE ZYGOTE AND THE, THE DEVELOPING EMBRYO.
###2507 THOUGH THIS DOUBLE FERTILIZATION PROCESS IS THOUGHT TO BE ANOTHER
###2510 REALLY IMPORTANT INNOVATION TO THE FLOWERING PLANTS IN TERMS OF
###2514 WAITING TO PRODUCE THE NUTRITIVE TISSUE UNTIL AFTER
###2517 FERTILIZATION.
###2525 OKAY, SO THEN I ALSO TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
###2527 FRUIT, SO DO STUDY THOSE FRUIT TYPES. I TALKED ABOUT THOSE
###2531 DIFFERENT FRUIT TYPES. AND ALSO TALKED ABOUT, SO YEAH, I MEAN
###2538 THERE WERE VARIOUS TYPES OF DISPERSAL WE TALKED ABOUT INVOLVING
###2541 SEEDS OR WHOLE FRUITS OR PLANTS, BOTH ABIOTIC AND BIOTIC, BOTH BY
###2547 ANIMAL AND BY PHYSICAL FORCES. AND I ALSO TALKED ABOUT
###2554 MECHANISMS AGAINST SELFING IN FLOWERING PLANTS. I DON'T HAVE A
###2558 SLIDE HERE TO SHOW YOU THAT BUT REMEMBER WE TALKED ABOUT THINGS
###2562 LIKE SPATIAL SEPARATION OF THE, OF THE STIGMA AND THE STAMENS.
###2567 DIFFERENTIAL TIMING OF MATURATION OF STAMENS AND PISTOLS.
###2574 UNISEXUAL, EVOLUTION OF UNISEXUAL OR I SHOULD SAY EVOLUTION OF
###2577 
###2577 PISTILLATE FUNCTION OCCURRING ON ONLY ONE SPOROPHYTE AND
###2583 STAMINATE FUNCTION ON ANOTHER SPOROPHYTE. THE DIOECIOUS
###2585 CONDITION. THINGS LIKE THAT. MAKE SURE TO REVIEW THOSE
###2589 IMPORTANT FEATURES IN TERMS OF MINIMIZING SELF-POLLINATION,
###2593 SELF-FERTILIZATION. AND THIS IS THAT FIGURE THAT I MENTIONED
###2600 THAT SHOW SOME OF THE IMPORTANT CHANGES WE SEE IN THE, IN THE
###2604 LAND PLANTS. SO HERE WE HAVE THE BRYOPHYTES AGAIN. AND HERE
###2610 ARE THE LAND, THE VASCULAR PLANTS. AND HERE ARE THE FLOWERING
###2615 PLANTS. SO AGAIN THE ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS IS SOMETHING
###2620 ALL THE LAND PLANTS SHARE. BUT AFTER THE LAND PLANTS DIVERGE
###2625 FROM THE GREEN ALGAE, THE CLOSEST FRESHWATER GREEN ALGAE HERE, WE
###2631 HAVE GAMETANGIA EVOLVING, SO ARCHEGONIA AND ANTHERIDIA. WE
###2637 ACTUALLY HAVE EMBRYOS EVOLVE. SO THESE ARE ALL CALLED THE
###2641 EMBRYOPHYTES. THAT'S ANOTHER NAME FOR ALL THE LAND PLANTS. AND
###2646 REMEMBER THE TRUE VASCULAR TISSUE EVOLVED IN THE SPOROPHYTES OF
###2653 THE VASCULAR PLANTS. WE DON'T GET TRUE VASCULAR TISSUE IN THE
###2658 BRYOPHYTES. TRUE ROOTS EVOLVE IN THE TRUE VASCULAR PLANTS. THE
###2663 BRYOPHYTES DON'T HAVE TRUE ROOTS. AND AS I MENTIONED THERE IS
###2670 HETEROSPORY THAT EVOLVED IN OTHER PLACES OTHER THAN JUST IN THE
###2674 SEED PLANTS BUT THE SEED PLANTS EVOLVE FROM HETEROSPOROUS
###2678 ANCESTORS. AND WE HAVE THIS REDUCTION IN THE GAMETOPHYTES
###2684 EVENTUALLY RESULTING IN THE LOSS OF THE ANTHERIDIA. THE POLLEN
###2689 DOESN'T HAVE ANTHERIDIA. AND IN THE FLOWERING PLANTS WE'VE EVEN
###2693 LOST THE ARCHEGONIUM AND WE HAVE DOUBLE FERTILIZATION. THE
###2698 CARPEL HERE AND THE EVOLUTION OF FRUIT. THOUGH THAT JUST
###2703 
###2703 REITERATES SOME OTHER POINTS ALREADY MADE. OKAY SO OTHER THINGS
###2709 TO STUDY, WE GET INTO STRUCTURE HERE, SO YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF
###2716 THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN DETERMINATE AND INDETERMINATE GROWTH.
###2718 ALL RIGHT, SO STEMS AND ROOTS UNDERGO INDETERMINATE GROWTH. AND
###2725 THEY HAVE GROWTH FROM THE APICAL MERISTEM, THE PRIMARY GROWTH
###2729 THAT RESULTS IN LENGTHENING, BOTH THE APICAL MERISTEM OF THE
###2733 SHOOT AS WELL AS THE ROOTS. BUT LEAVES HAVE DETERMINATE GROWTH
###2739 TYPICALLY. THEY ONLY, THE MERISTEMS AND LEAVES LAST ONLY A
###2744 BRIEF TIME UNTIL THE LEAF IS FULLY FORMED. AND THE SAME GOES
###2747 WITH THE FLOWER. REMEMBER THE FLOWER IS A DETERMINATE SHOOT
###2753 AFTER THE PISTOLS ARE FORMED. IT DOESN'T CONTINUE TO DEVELOP.
###2756 IT TERMINATES. BUT INDETERMINATE GROWTH IS THIS WHOLE, WHAT WE
###2761 SEE WHICH IS SO DIFFERENT FROM ANIMALS WHERE HAVE THESE TISSUES
###2765 THAT CONTINUE TO BE, THESE GROWING POINTS THAT CONTINUE TO
###2770 DEVELOP AND THOSE INCLUDE NOT ONLY APICAL MERISTEMS AND PRIMARY
###2773 GROWTH BUT LATERAL MERISTEMS AND SECONDARY GROWTH OF EUDICOTS,
###2780 CONIFERS, BUT NOT MONOCOTS. REMEMBER MONOCOTS DON'T HAVE
###2783 SECONDARY GROWTH. SO BE AWARE OF BOTH TYPES OF LATERAL
###2787 MERISTEMS, THE VASCULAR CAMBIUM AND THE CORK CAMBIUM THAT ARE
###2792 BOTH RESULTING IN THICKENING GROWTH. INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF
###2797 VASCULAR TISSUE IN THE CASE OF THE VASCULAR CAMBIUM. INCREASE
###2800 IN THE AMOUNT OF DERMAL TISSUE IN THE CASE OF THE CORK CAMBIUM.
###2805 OKAY WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME LEFT. BUT SO REVIEW CELL TYPES AND
###2816 TISSUE SYSTEMS. THERE ARE JUST A FEW OF EACH. AND BE FAMILIAR
###2820 WITH THOSE. REMEMBER WE TALKED ABOUT PARENCHYMA, COLLENCHYMA,
###2823 
###2823 SCLERENCHYMA, VASCULAR TISSUE OF WHICH WE HAVE A COUPLE OF TYPES,
###2828 PHLOEM AND XYLEM, AND THOSE CELL TYPES. MODIFIED STRUCTURES, I
###2837 TALKED ABOUT MODIFIED ROOTS, MODIFIED STEMS, MODIFIED LEAVES.
###2841 YOU SHOULD BE FAMILIAR WITH THOSE AND BE ABLE TO SAY WHICH IS A
###2844 LEAF, WHICH IS A STEM, WHICH IS A ROOT. AND AGAIN THE TYPES OF
###2850 MERISTEMS, LATERAL MERISTEMS, FOR EXAMPLE. SOME OF THE
###2856 CONSEQUENCES OF SECONDARY GROWTH IN TERMS OF, YOU KNOW THIS
###2861 THICKENING GROWTH AND WHAT, THERE ARE SOME SLIDES THAT HAD TO DO
###2865 WITH THAT. I TALKED ABOUT NUTRIENTS BRIEFLY SO MOBILE VERSUS
###2873 IMMOBILE NUTRIENTS. I'M NOT EXPECTING YOU TO MEMORIZE ALL OF
###2877 THE DIFFERENT MACRO AND MICRONUTRIENTS. BUT REALIZE THERE ARE
###2881 MACRONUTRIENTS AND MICRONUTRIENTS. THE CASPARIAN STRIP HERE IN
###2890 THE ENDODERMIS AND ITS IMPORTANCE FOR SERVING AS A BUFFER,
###2894 SERVING AS A BARRIER TO MOVEMENT FROM THE SOIL, MOVEMENT OF
###2899 SOLUTES AND SUBSTANCES FROM THE SOIL INTO THE VASCULAR TISSUE.
###2903 WE TALKED QUITE A BIT ABOUT THIS. AND I ALSO TALKED ABOUT,
###2913 WELL, WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT MYCORRHIZAL. WE TALKED ABOUT WATER
###2916 POTENTIAL AND THE IMPORTANCE OF WATER POTENTIAL IN TERMS OF
###2920 MOVEMENT OF WATER, FREE ENERGY OF WATER, SO WATER GOES FROM HIGH
###2925 WATER POTENTIAL TO LOW WATER POTENTIAL. IT'S GOING TO, WE
###2928 TALKED ABOUT OSMOSIS, VERY SIMILAR PRINCIPLES. AND HOW WATER'S
###2934 TRANSPORTED IN THE XYLEM VERSUS THE PHLOEM, REMEMBER? SO HERE
###2939 IT'S NEGATIVE PRESSURE BASICALLY THAT'S PULLING THE WATER UP
###2944 WHEREAS HERE WE HAVE POSITIVE, POSITIVE PRESSURE PUSHING THE
###2948 PHLOEM THROUGH THE SIEVE TUBES. SO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PASSIVE
###2956 
###2956 AND ACTIVE TRANSPORT VERSUS BULK FLOW. REMEMBER PASSIVE AND
###2961 ACTIVE TRANSPORT IS MOVEMENT ACROSS A MEMBRANE. BULK FLOW IS
###2965 NOT. IT'S MOVEMENT WITHIN TUBES AND WE HAVE THESE TWO DIFFERENT
###2968 TYPES HERE. AND PHOTOPERIODISM. I TALKED QUITE A BIT ABOUT
###2974 THAT. SO BE AWARE ABOUT PHOTOPERIODISM. YOU SHOULD BE
###2978 FAMILIAR WITH WHAT A SHORT DAY AND WHAT A LONG-DAY PLANT ARE
###2981 RESPONDING TO IN TERMS OF STIMULI TO FLOWER. AND I TALKED, SO
###2987 HAVE A GENERAL UNDERSTANDING ALSO OF HORMONE ACTION. SO I
###2992 TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF DOSAGE IN HORMONES, THE IMPORTANCE
###2996 OF HOW THEY CAN HAVE DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS ON DIFFERENT TISSUES OR
###3000 TISSUES OF DIFFERENT AGES OR YOU KNOW THE DOSAGE CAN HAVE, MAKE,
###3004 CAN RESULT IN A DIFFERENT EFFECT. AND THAT THE BALANCE OF
###3008 HORMONES IS REALLY IMPORTANT. SO THOSE WERE SOME MAJOR POINTS.
###3014 AND ALSO FINALLY, THE MAJOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE HORMONES AND
###3017 THEIR PRIMARY ACTION. SO I HAD A LIST OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF
###3021 HORMONES AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THOSE HORMONES ARE MOST
###3025 IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF, WHAT KINDS OF RESPONSES THEY TEND TO
###3029 SIGNAL. ARE THERE ANY LAST QUESTIONS? OFFICE HOURS I'M GOING
###3035 TO CONTINUE TO HOLD THEM THROUGH, UP UNTIL THE DAY OF THE FINAL
###3038 SO YOU KNOW JUST, JUST COME WHEN YOU CAN IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL
###3042 QUESTIONS. OKAY.
###3044
