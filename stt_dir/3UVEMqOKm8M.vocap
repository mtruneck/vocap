###0 KEVIN SCHWANTZ: Red Bull Rookies Cup is the toughest
###3 playing field that you can play in.
###6 Last year I had kids from 14 different countries competing
###8 in eight different races.
###11 You really got to have the right attitude.
###13 You've got to have a big heart and a ton of motivation.
###17 DANNY WALKER: You've got to compete against the best kids
###19 in front of 200,000 fans.
###21 If that's not pressure, I don't know what is.
###23 
###26 ADRIANA SOLIS: They say, aren't you scared?
###27 Yes, I am, I'm scared.
###30 KEVIN SCHWANTZ: At any level, MotoGP is what you strive to
###33 be if you want to be the best that there is in the world.
###37 [BASS MUSIC PLAYING]
###68 JAKE GAGNE: Yeah, coming over here to race in Europe, it's
###70 definitely a shock.
###71 It's hard to get around sometimes, not knowing the
###73 language and whatnot.
###74 But overall, it's fun.
###76 It's adventure, and you get to see a lot of new things.
###79 HAYDEN GILLIM: I think it's a positive thing that I'm doing
###82 this, and that it's a blessing because God gave me this
###86 talent and I want to use it as best I can.
###93 BENNY SOLIS: I was watching every race on the
###94 Internet and all that.
###95 And I was like, talking to my dad, wouldn't that be cool if
###98 I was there.
###98 And once I got accepted, I was so happy.
###101 
###109 -Scholtz has got an absolute fire there, his head down,
###112 looking behind him.
###113 It's fanned out behind him.
###115 Stuck with 20 forwards in the-- oh, and he got caught up
###117 with somebody else.
###120 Fagerhaug is crashed, my goodness, what an absolute
###123 disaster for Sterla.
###124 It's all gone wrong for him this weekend.
###128 Now who's going to make it?
###129 Who's bravest?
###129 It's Mayer that's bravest on the brakes, but Scholtz got a
###132 better drive on the inside coming out.
###134 It's side by side, they're rubbing elbows now.
###135 Scholtz and Mayer, rubbing elbows into the left hander.
###138 Oh, and that's Harry Stafford!.
###140 He's gone down, and he's clipped by another rider.
###142 Harry Stafford goes down, let's hope he's OK.
###145 Holding up the inside comes Fagerhaug.
###146 Fagerhaug with the red helmet, way up the inside, he does the
###149 Valentino last lap maneuver there.
###152 He's done it brilliantly.
###154 absolutely sensational job.
###156 Sterla Fagerhaug turned his weekend around completely, and
###159 it's Sterla Fagerhaug who wins from Matthew
###162 Scholtz and Danny Kent.

###174 KEVIN SCHWANTZ: Red Bull Rookies Cup's main initiative
###176 is to try and create a program for 13 to 17-year-old kids to
###181 be able to then step directly into grand prix racing.
###184 It's a program that, last year, had kids from 14
###187 different countries competing in eight different races.
###191 When I started racing in the mid '80s, it was a set of my
###194 uncle's borrowed dirt track leathers, and probably a
###197 helmet that didn't fit exactly right, and whatever boots I
###200 could find at the time, and going and racing on a bike
###204 that I had prepared.
###205 The Red Bull Rookies Cup gives these kids a first class
###208 operation, first class equipment, the best tires, the
###212 best suspension, engineers set behind everything.
###215 
###217 MotoGP is what, if you've ever become a road racer of any
###222 kind at any level, what you strive to be if you want to be
###225 the best that there is in the world.
###227 So from a rider's standpoint, it's the toughest playing
###230 field that you can play in.
###232 It's a sport that, at the top, pays some
###235 really, really big paychecks.
###238 Any place in Europe, anybody who races grand prix bikes is
###241 obviously just as big a name as any sports
###243 star here in America.
###245 PETER CLIFFORD: We start here in Harris, where Sunday sees
###247 like 200,000 people packing the place, and that just
###251 really buoys the level of intensity about
###254 the whole race meeting.
###255 And the kids sort of rise to the occasion.
###257 HAYDEN GILLIM: It's just a little different than what a
###259 normal teenager's life is like.
###262 BENNY SOLIS: Last season went really good for me actually.
###264 I won four races out of, I think it was nine.
###266 And ended up winning a championship.
###268 So that's why I'm here, racing this.
###272 PETER CLIFFORD: There's no doubt that coming into 2009,
###274 we have some favorites for the cup.
###276 That's still Fagerhaug in his third year now.
###279 It was tremendous force last year.
###281 STERLA FAGERHAUG: Considering I've been one of the fastest
###283 guys from the beginning, it's hard to improve on your riding
###287 when you're at the top already in this cup.
###289 Still, it's not like I'm freaking out, like it's too
###291 much pressure on me.
###292 It's not like that.
###293 PETER CLIFFORD: We know that the three Americans that are
###294 here are strong.
###295 Benny Solis won the AMA Cup, and he
###297 didn't do that by accident.
###299 So I would expect that as he gets into his stride, Benny
###301 and Jake Gagne and Hayden Gillim, they'll be fighting at
###304 the front as well.
###307 Really, there are two ways that riders can get into the
###309 Rookies Cup.
###310 Riders can send in their CVs and convince us that they
###312 really should be considered for selection.
###314 Than there are championships around the world, which we
###317 take a look at and really invite the best riders into
###320 the selection process.
###321 KEVIN SCHWANTZ: We look for kids that have good attitudes.
###323 We look for kids that don't, after the first practice
###326 session and they're not the fastest kids out there, they
###328 come out with a list of excuses.
###329 We look for a kid that asks questions.
###331 Hey, how can I better myself?
###333 How can I work better?
###334 How can I work with the team better?
###335 There's lots of kids out there that, given the right
###337 opportunity, I think could do this.
###340 But you really got to have the right attitude, you got to
###342 have a big heart and a ton of motivation.
###344 PETER CLIFFORD: There's a very intense level
###346 of competition here.
###348 I've heard some of the young Americans say that things are
###350 a bit rough here.
###351 There's a lot of elbowing that goes on, and that's something
###354 that they've got to get used to.
###355 But it is a bit of a shock for them at first.
###358 [ROCK MUSIC PLAYS]
###371 -From the third row, but it looks like Scholz has got
###373 another good start.
###374 Scholz [INAUDIBLE] pulls across to the left hand side
###377 to get a run into the first corner.
###378 And Hayden Gillim seems to have problems.
###380 He's not going anywhere in a hurry, I think.
###383 Now Fagerhaug pulls out of the slipstream, Scholtz comes
###385 across the track.
###386 Now Emery is there, number 21 as well there.
###388 Hard on the brakes.
###389 Fagerhaug goes up the inside and into the lead.
###394 Trying to chase this man, Alex
###395 Christian, down goes Christian.
###398 These guys have not learned from yesterday.
###400 It shows their lack of experience.
###402 -Marino with Fagerhaug in the red helmet has
###403 a lock on the inside.
###404 Very nicely through.
###406 Fagerhaug and three of them in side by side.
###408 Well that's desperate stuff as they go past on
###410 either side of Fagerhaug.
###411 Absolutely sensational stuff there.
###414 Fagerhaug passes now by Danny Kent, and it's his favorite
###417 passing move, but Kent has done that to Fagerhaug now
###420 three times.
###421 Danny runs wide, Fagerhaug gets [INAUDIBLE].
###423 Kent is in front of him.
###424 Really, Kent should have it.
###426 It's Danny Kent that's going to win his first Rookie Cup
###428 Race on Sterla Fagerhaug.
###429 
###435 [MUSIC -- "GOD SAVE THE QUEEN"]
###437 
###453 HAYDEN GILLIM: In Europe, everybody's more aggressive--
###458 brake a lot earlier, but run the corners a lot faster.
###462 It's just a little bit harder.
###464 JAKE GAGNE: This is where you want to be.
###465 If you want to be at the top and race against the fastest
###470 guys, then Europe is where you want to be.
###473 DANNY WALKER: You're 12, 13, 14, 15 years old, you've got
###476 to travel clear across the world to be here, and then
###478 you've got to compete against the best kids in front of
###481 200,000 fans.
###482 If that's not pressure, I don't what is.
###486 BENNY SOLIS: The race didn't go like I wanted it to.
###489 Second to last lap the bike started sputtering, so I
###492 didn't finish the race.
###494 Yeah, we're going straight home now.
###496 And then, hopefully, when we get to Italy it'll be a better
###498 weekend for me.
###499 [BASS MUSIC PLAYING]
###520 BENNY SOLIS: This was actually the Red Bull suit from the
###522 first year of the Rookies Cup.
###524 I'm just afraid to wear it.
###525 I don't want to crash in it 'cause I'm kind of keeping it
###527 as a memory, 'cause that year went really good for me.
###530 Most I'm I'm just nervous, but I'm trying
###532 to calm myself down.
###533 But before a race, if I'm real calm, I
###535 normally don't do good.
###536 So I know it's a good sign when I'm nervous.
###538 
###547 I can do sometimes 50 to 100 laps 'cause it's pretty small.
###550 But it's a good work out.
###551 I like it.
###553 I play the video game a lot.
###554 I just like to know where the track goes around, the
###556 configuration and what turn comes up next.
###559 But the game doesn't help much with anything,
###561 like bumps or anything.
###562 It's just the shape of the track and all that.
###565 
###570 ADRIANA SOLIS: When they ask me, like, what kind of
###571 motorcycles?
###572 And I usually say the one that drags the knee.
###575 And they're like really?
###576 Then I'm like, yeah.
###577 It's like, aren't you scared?
###579 Aren't you?
###579 Yes, I am.
###580 BEN SOLIS: I get scared, but I've been there, and I know
###583 what Benny's feeling.
###585 And when you race, it's like OK, crashes are normal.
###590 So when I see my boy crash, and as long as he gets up
###594 right away or he's moving and he's OK then I feel OK.
###597 ADRIANA SOLIS: I guess I changed from fear to
###600 excitement.
###602 It's really exciting to see him race.
###604 
###611 BEN SOLIS: Sometimes we stretch it to the limit, like
###613 OK we can't pay this bill because we've got to go buy
###616 tires for the 125.
###618 So my wife kind of gets mad, and she tells me, well you're
###621 not going to pay the bill, you're going
###622 to buy him the tires?
###623 And I said well, we got to go race.
###626 BENNY SOLIS: My mom and my dad also support me because they
###629 work really hard to help me do it.
###633 ADRIANA SOLIS: It's what he wants.
###634 I have to support him either way.
###636 Because if I was in his position, he'd be doing the
###638 same for me, right?
###640 Right?
###641 [LAUGHTER]
###645 ADRIANA SOLIS: This is a gift that God gave my son and he's
###649 putting all his energy and effort to it.
###651 Now we need to be with him.
###654 BENNY SOLIS: We're leaving tomorrow
###654 around 11, around there.
###657 And then we arrive Italy, in, I think, the next day.
###661 ADRIANA SOLIS: I'm the one who takes them to the airport.
###664 So I stay home nervous, waiting for them to come back.
###670 BEN SOLIS: I got to think about it like,
###671 is this really happening?
###673 So it's amazing.
###675
