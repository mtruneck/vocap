###49 Cave Hotel
###51 Is a large and commodious establishment
###53 capable of entertaining 500 guests.
###56 It is constructed on the cottage plan
###58 and the rooms are furnished in a style equal to any first class hotel.
###63 It is the beau ideal of a fashionable summer resort
###66 in the South.
###68 A magnificent ball room is attached to the Hotel.
###71 Curious Sand-Stone Rock
###74 Excavated near the cave about 15 years since,
###77 and now to be seen in the hotel yard.
###81 Path Leading to the Mouth of Cave
###84 Is about a quarter of a mile in length
###86 extending from the hotel
###87 through a gorge in a dense wood.
###90 Visitors generally supply themselves with stout branches from the trees
###94 to assist themselves in their explorations of the rugged paths of the cave.
###100 Out for the Last Time
###102 This is a picture of the gentlemen who conceived
###104 and executed the project
###106 of Photographing the cave,
###108 with the reflectors and etcetera used.
###112 Mouth of the Cave
###114 is 194 feet above Green River,
###117 125 feet in height by
###120 30 in width.
###121 In summer visitors experience a sudden change of temperature when
###126 they stand on the embankment
###127 above the entrance
###129 and a cold blast rushes out from the cave,
###132 the temperature is invariably 59 degrees.
###136 The scene, looking down towards the immediate entrance,
###139 a distance of 100 yards
###141 is picturesque in the extreme
###144 and impresses the beholder
###145 with a feeling of awe at the contemplation of the subterraneous
###149 world beneath his feet.
###152 Mouth of the Cave
###154 This view introduces three well know guides.
###157 The one on the right is old Mat,
###159 he has acted in the capacity of guide for the last 30 years.
###165 Gothic Chapel
###166 A mile from the entrance is a large room
###169 from the ceiling of which hang gigantic stalactites, extending to the floor.
###174 It is represented here as it appeared when lightedup with magnesium light,
###178 the glare of which may be seen behind the columns on the right.
###182 Column of Hercules
###185 Is also in the Gothic Chapel.
###187 It is formed by the union of stalactites and stalagmites
###191 is eight feet in height
###193 and thirty in circumference.
###195 The length of time necessary to form such a column
###198 may be inferred from the fact that it takes fifty years to form
###202 an incrustation no thicker than a wafer.
###206 The Altar
###207 In the foreground is a cluster of columns called the Altar,
###211 at which a romantic marriage took place between two parties
###215 whose union on the face of the earth
###218 was prevented by family interference.
###221 Devil's Arm Chair,
###223 In Gothic Avenue is a large column about 500 yards beyond the chapel.
###228 There is a niche or seat
###230 and which one of the guides maybe seen sitting.
###233 The ceiling of Gothic Avenue
###235 singularly beautiful
###236 as the stalactites assume the most fantastic shapes.
###240 In the niche of this column
###241 the celebrated Jenny Lind rested for some time
###244 during her visit to the cave.
###247 End of Gothic Avenue
###249 The avenue terminates about a half mile beyond the chapel
###253 at "Elephant's Head" and "Lover's Leap."
###256 The former is a large stalagmite
###258 shaped like the head of the animal after which it is named
###261 and the latter is a rock projecting 16 feet
###264 over a black abyss.
###267 Wandering Willie's Spring
###269 trickling down from the roof and the wall of rock
###274 on the left hand side of the Main Cave
###276 beyond the Rotunda and Methodist Church.
###279 It is named after a country violinist who wandered away from his party,
###283 had his lamp extinguished
###285 and was found lying asleep beside the spring.
###288 On the left will be observed some names of visitors
###291 cut on the rock.
###293 The spring is about half a mile from the entrance.
###296 Standing Rocks
###298 Are fifteen feet in length and many tons in weight
###301 and evidently fell from the roof of the cave
###304 at a time when the entire cave was filled with water.
###307 They stand in a upright position
###309 and are 3/4 of a mile from the entrance.
###313 Entrance to Rocky Hall
###315 Looking from Main Cave.
###317 A few feet beyond Standing Rocks
###319 to the left of Main Cave is Rocky Hall.
###322 It is reached by ascending a few steps on rocks piled up at the entrance.
###327 Giant's Coffin
###329 Is an immense rock 40 feet long,
###331 twenty wide and eight high,
###334 which has been detached from the avenue against which it rests.
###338 On the left
###339 beneath the coffin may be seen a narrow passage
###342 which leads into Deserted Chamber.
###345 Giant's Coffin presents a gloomy sepulchral appearance
###348 when lighted up by the glare of the magnesium light.
###352 It is on the right of Main Cave,
###353 one mile from the entrance.
###356 Entrance to Long Route,
###358 Is on the left of Giant's Coffin and so narrow and low that visitors
###362 have to stoop almost to almost to the ground in passing through it.
###366 On the right may be seen the end of Giant's Coffin.
###369 By some it is supposed that the water receded from the main cave
###373 through this passage.
###375 Deserted Chamber,
###377 Is a dreary looking room about 100 feet in length.
###380 The guide in the picture is entering the chamber
###383 from the narrow passage beneath the Giant's Coffin.
###386 In Wooden Bowl Chamber
###388 adjoining this apartment
###389 curious looking Indian bowl was found.
###392 The Indians used long reeds
###394 filled with deer's fat
###396 as torches to guide them through the cave.
###399 Gorin's Dome
###400 Is 200 feet high and 60 wide.
###404 It is reached by descending from the Deserted Chamber
###407 to a narrow rugged causeway called the Labyrinth, passing over a small bridge
###412 and ascending a ladder.
###414 The far side appears like an immense curtain.
###417 When there is a rise in the subterraneous rivers,
###420 the floor of the dome is covered with water
###423 in which eyeless fish are caught.
###425 The view is taken half way between the roof and the floor.
###429 It is called after one of the former proprietors of the cave.
###434 Bottomless Pit and Bridge of Sighs,
###437 Are on the main route to Echo River
###439 and mile-and-a-half from the entrance
###441 The pit is of a immense depth and over it
###444 is thrown a substantial wooden bridge,
###447 across which visitors pass
###449 in the long route and
###450 towards Pensacola Avenue.
###452 The pit presents a sight of awful sublimity
###456 hen its steep sides are lighted
###458 up by the guide.
###459 View From Bridge of Sighs,
###462 Shows a part of Shelby?s Dome overhanging the terrible pit.
###466 It is wild and dreary beyond conception.
###469 The dark avenue to the right is inaccessible to human footsteps,
###473 that is supposed to lead a vast distance
###476 further into the bowels of he earth.
###479 Beyond The Bridge of Sighs,
###481 This view represents two of the guides, just having crossed the bridge towards Reveler's Hall.
###487 They are facing the Bottomless Pit,
###489 overhanging which is the rock in the foreground.
###493 Pit Beneath the Bridge,
###495 Here are the steep sides of the Bottomless Pit
###498 far below the bridge.
###500 The view was taken from a narrow ledge of rocks overhanging the fearful chasm.
###505 The rock on the right projects 30 feet
###508 and extends from the brink of the pit
###510 to 50 feet below the bridge.
###513 Wild Hall,
###514 Is in Pensacola Avenue.
###516 The floor is strewn with immense rocks
###519 that have become detached from the roof.
###521 The cliffs on the left are called the Snow Cliffs,
###525 as they seem to be covered with flakes of snow.
###528 It is two miles from the entrance.
###531 Snowball Archway,
###533 Is also in Pensacola Avenue.
###537 The ceiling of white gypsum looks as if it was covered with snow
###539 and presents a most beautiful appearance.
###542 Symmetry of the natural buttresses which project from the side of the cliff
###546 is also striking and interesting.
###549 Grand Crossing
###551 Is in Pensacola Avenue.
###553 Here four large avenues branch off from the main one.
###557 The rocks here are completely covered
###559 with the names of visitors scratched on them.
###562 Grand Crossing is about 2 miles and a 1/4 from the entrance.
###566 Angelica's Grotto
###568 Is also in Pensacola Avenue.
###571 The little girl in the picture
###572 is resting on Angelica's Couch
###574 over the foot of which hangs the Pine Apple Bush,
###578 a curious looking rock.
###580 Scotchman's Trap
###582 Is on the road to the river,
###584 about 500 yards beyond the Bottomless Pit.
###587 The trap is a small circular opening
###589 through which it is necessary to descend a few steps
###592 to go toward the river.
###594 Over this narrow opening is
###596 suspended a huge rock many tons in weight,
###600 which, if it fell
###601 would completely close up the avenue leading to the Echo River.
###606 The guide in the picture is
###607 standing at the head of the steps.
###610 Dinning in Great Relief
###613 Is entered after passing through the narrow, tortuous passage
###617 called Fat Man's Misery.
###619 It is indeed a relief
###621 for the aching bones of the
###623 visitor after threading the narrow path above mentioned
###626 and the dinner party in the picture
###628 seem to think so.
###629 One of the guides is pouring out some of
###632 Kentucky's unrivaled beverage,
###634 Bourbon Whiskey,
###635 for the relief of his companions.
###638 Bacon Chamber
###639 Is situated to the right of River Hall which is entered from Great Relief.
###644 The curious projections from the roof
###647 resembling flitches of bacon, are caused by the action of water at a period when
###652 the chamber was completely filled with water.
###654 It is one of the best views taken in the cave.
###659 Is immediately above Bacon Chamber
###662 and at the commencement of Spark's Avenue which leads to Mammoth Dome.
###666 Several unexplored avenues branch off here in every direction.
###671 The scene represents a party of bandits
###672 at dinner and as reviewed by the magnesium light
###677 exceeds in Romantic wildness the most extravagant conceptions of Salvator Rosa.
###685 Pillars in Mammoth Dome
###687 The Mammoth Dome is one of the largest in the world.
###690 It is 250 feet in height
###692 and of immense size.
###694 Those pillars are of
###695 colossal dimensions
###697 and standing beneath them
###698 one would imagine himself amid the ruins
###701 of some Egyptian temple.
###704 Corinthian Columns
###706 Those columns are at the furthest extremity of Mammoth Dome
###710 and resemble the broken columns of the Acropolis of Athens and Corinth.
###715 Cliffs Over the Dead Sea
###717 The Dead Sea is a black ominous looking body of water,
###720 about 40 feet below the terrace
###723 on which the three persons in the picture are standing.
###727 Visitors pass along the terrace
###729 and descend the ladder on their way to the river.
###732 The sea lies below the foot of the rock
###734 over which the parties in the view are looking.
###738 Ole Bull?s Concert Room
###740 Is a mile and a half beyond Echo River
###742 and five miles from the entrance.
###745 from the entrance. It is at the end of Silliman?s Avenue.
###748 The black gorge to the right
###749 is the entrance to Pass of El Ghor.
###752 he celebrated violinist performed in this room during his visit to the cave.
###757 Hanging Rocks
###759 Are in the Pass of El Ghor
###761 about a mile from Ole Bull?s concert room.
###764 Visitors experience much uneasiness
###766 in passing under these rocks,
###769 as they seem to be on the point of tumbling down on their heads,
###772 but since the discovery of the cave,
###775 no rocks have been known to fall
###777 in any part of it.
###778 Martha's Vineyard
###779 Is elevated about 20 feet above the Pass of El Ghor
###784 and receives it name from the appearance,
###787 shape and size of the dark stalactites formations on the side and roof
###791 which closely resemble grapes
###794 Martha?s Vineyard is six miles and a half from the entrance.
###798 Grape Clusters
###800 This view shows a section of the side of Martha?s Vineyard
###804 and sufficiently explains the meaning of the name
###807 which has been given it.
###809 The entire walls of the vineyard
###811 are covered with pendant clusters of mineral grapes.
###816 Snowball Chamber
###817 Is about a quarter of a mile beyond Martha?s Vineyard.
###821 The roof seems to be one mass of snowballs
###824 each of which is from 2 to 4 inches in diameter.
###828 Mary's Bower
###830 Is situated in Cleveland?s Cabinet
###832 The flowers here represented are of a very delicate formation.

###854 Two crevices intersect each other at right angles
###859 and are lined with beautiful flowers formed of plaster of Paris.
###863 the last rose of summer
###866 This is one of the most beautiful gypsum formations in the cave.
###870 It is eight inches in diameter
###873 and of snowy whiteness.
###875 The distance from the entrance to this point in Cleveland Cabinet is 7 and a half miles
###881 and from here to the end of the Long Route one and a half miles.
