NARRATOR: Much has changed
in the valley, and


3
0:0:11,5 --> 0:0:12,34
much remains the same.


4
0:0:12,34 --> 0:0:15,34
The farmer tills his
fields today as his


5
0:0:15,34 --> 0:0:17,801
ancestors did in ages past.


6
0:0:17,801 --> 0:0:20,16
A heritage endures.

0:0:20,16 --> 0:0:22,96
The people of the valley
come and go.


8
0:0:22,96 --> 0:0:27,5
Life, in village and city goes
on as generations have come


9
0:0:27,5 --> 0:0:30,45
and gone, the mountain streams
have flowed on.


10
0:0:30,45 --> 0:0:33,72
The friendly earth still
yields its produce.


11
0:0:33,72 --> 0:0:37,6
And cradling the valley, now
as always, silent, lofty


12
0:0:37,6 --> 0:0:39,93

eternal vigil.

DAVID FEINBERG: Every piece of
coal in China is intended to


15
0:0:53,93 --> 0:0:57,32
go through one of the national
coal factories.


16
0:0:57,32 --> 0:0:59,9
This is a private coal mine
that was shut down by the


17
0:0:59,9 --> 0:1:1,35
authorities.


18
0:1:1,35 --> 0:1:4,16
Private mining is illegal, but
since there's such a crazy


19
0:1:4,16 --> 0:1:7,14
demand for coal, a lot of people
try to start their own


20
0:1:7,14 --> 0:1:11,72
mine in order to profit from
the lucrative black market.


21
0:1:11,72 --> 0:1:14,5
Most of them are not successful
and get fined or


22
0:1:14,5 --> 0:1:15,75
put in jail.

DAVID FEINBERG: The enormous
government


27
0:1:55,15 --> 0:1:56,89
factories are easy to spot.


28
0:1:56,89 --> 0:2:0,0
We drove by a lot of them but
never hung out for very long


29
0:2:0,0 --> 0:2:3,245
because we didn't want the
security guards to see us.

DAVID FEINBERG: To get a better
sense of the illegal


33
0:2:22,44 --> 0:2:25,56
coal industry, we went into
the hills about two hours


34
0:2:25,56 --> 0:2:27,25
outside of Linfen.


35
0:2:27,25 --> 0:2:30,33
The area was still dense with
pollution, and we started to


36
0:2:30,33 --> 0:2:33,9
see smaller factories and then
what appeared to be some


37
0:2:33,9 --> 0:2:35,77
illegal mines.


38
0:2:35,77 --> 0:2:38,3
Since they're not regulated
by the government and are


39
0:2:38,3 --> 0:2:41,68
operated using old methods, the
illegal mines are a big


40
0:2:41,68 --> 0:2:42,95
part of the pollution problem.

DAVID FEINBERG: Most of the
people we approached for


54
0:4:35,64 --> 0:4:37,4
interviews were very
friendly with us.


55
0:4:37,4 --> 0:4:40,1



56
0:4:40,1 --> 0:4:42,53
But pretty soon they realized
that the questions we were


57
0:4:42,53 --> 0:4:46,11
asking could get them
in trouble.


58
0:4:46,11 --> 0:4:48,88
A lot of the residents of Linfen
have been excluded from


59
0:4:48,88 --> 0:4:52,54
the economic prosperity that
has come to the region.


60
0:4:52,54 --> 0:4:55,35
It's basically what happens when
a bunch of farmers are


61
0:4:55,35 --> 0:4:58,41
forced to try to make a living
from harvesting coal instead


62
0:4:58,41 --> 0:5:1,44
of harvesting crops.


63
0:5:1,44 --> 0:5:4,5
Everywhere we went, people
seemed to be scavenging for


64
0:5:4,5 --> 0:5:6,76
bricks, metal, wire
or anything else


65
0:5:6,76 --> 0:5:8,1
to make some money.


66
0:5:8,1 --> 0:5:44,71



67
0:5:44,71 --> 0:5:46,45
After spending a week
in Linfen, my


68
0:5:46,45 --> 0:5:47,83
eyes burned a little.


69
0:5:47,83 --> 0:5:51,56
My throat itched, and when I
picked my nose, my burgers had


70
0:5:51,56 --> 0:5:52,81
turned black.

DAVID FEINBERG: After almost a
week in Linfen, the police


75
0:7:2,95 --> 0:7:4,36
came to our hotel.


76
0:7:4,36 --> 0:7:7,27
They didn't come to our rooms,
but they had the hotel staff


77
0:7:7,27 --> 0:7:11,21
bring us what our translator
said were registration forms.


78
0:7:11,21 --> 0:7:14,71
We were afraid that our tapes
might get confiscated because,


79
0:7:14,71 --> 0:7:17,17
after all, we were filming
illegally.


80
0:7:17,17 --> 0:7:20,2
We were basically there as
tourists who happened to have


81
0:7:20,2 --> 0:7:22,75
professional video cameras.


82
0:7:22,75 --> 0:7:26,91
We got a last glimpse of the
factories and empty rivers.


83
0:7:26,91 --> 0:7:28,6
It was as good a time
as any to leave.


84
0:7:28,6 --> 0:7:31,73



85
0:7:31,73 --> 0:7:35,34
-We are faced with a very short
tiny window to make the


86
0:7:35,34 --> 0:7:37,71
right choices about
our future.


87
0:7:37,71 --> 0:7:40,33
So it's not a question
about whether or not


88
0:7:40,33 --> 0:7:41,98
China should develop.


89
0:7:41,98 --> 0:7:44,26
China has to develop in
order to lift more


90
0:7:44,26 --> 0:7:46,17
people out of poverty.


91
0:7:46,17 --> 0:7:49,75
However, it's more about how
China should develop.


92
0:7:49,75 --> 0:7:53,41
The local-level officials are
still very much obsessed with


93
0:7:53,41 --> 0:7:55,27
just economic growth.


94
0:7:55,27 --> 0:7:59,79
Really, the evaluation of
officials' performance have to


95
0:7:59,79 --> 0:8:3,16
change in a big way in order
to give more incentive for


96
0:8:3,16 --> 0:8:6,1
those people on the local
level to do more for the


97
0:8:6,1 --> 0:8:7,46
environment.


98
0:8:7,46 --> 0:8:9,56
DAVID FEINBERG: When the World
Bank first named Linfen the


99
0:8:9,56 --> 0:8:12,66
most polluted city on earth,
the Chinese government set


100
0:8:12,66 --> 0:8:14,63
about to improve
the situation--


101
0:8:14,63 --> 0:8:18,8
closing down factories,
rerouting truck traffic, and


102
0:8:18,8 --> 0:8:20,17
there were even some signs
around the city calling


103
0:8:20,17 --> 0:8:21,42
attention to the problem.


104
0:8:21,42 --> 0:8:56,58



105
0:8:56,58 --> 0:8:59,13
As for the coal trucks, we were
surrounded by them for


106
0:8:59,13 --> 0:9:1,45
another 20 hours as we drove
back to Beijing.


107
0:9:1,45 --> 0:9:4,655



108
0:9:4,655 --> 0:9:8,34
And we sat in our van at one
tollbooth for about six hours


109
0:9:8,34 --> 0:9:10,92
in the middle of the night.


110
0:9:10,92 --> 0:9:13,59
All of the fumes helped me sleep
through most of it, as


111
0:9:13,59 --> 0:9:16,87
coal trucks idled around us, and
the car in front of us ran


112
0:9:16,87 --> 0:9:18,12
out of gas.


113
0:9:18,12 --> 0:9:40,8



114
0:9:40,8 --> 0:9:43,51
Growing up, my impression of
China was of a huge boulevard


115
0:9:43,51 --> 0:9:45,82
entirely full of bicycles.


116
0:9:45,82 --> 0:9:48,64
They've obviously been replaced
by cars and trucks.


117
0:9:48,64 --> 0:9:51,98
And if you add the burning of
coal to that, as well as all


118
0:9:51,98 --> 0:9:55,46
of the manufacturing that goes
on, China is now the world's


119
0:9:55,46 --> 0:9:57,25
leading polluter.


120
0:9:57,25 --> 0:10:2,7
-I think that China is trying
its best, tried to host a good


121
0:10:2,7 --> 0:10:8,88
Olympic game, and try to give
a good impression for the


122
0:10:8,88 --> 0:10:11,7
whole rest of the word.


123
0:10:11,7 --> 0:10:15,7
Measures tried to clean up air
for the Beijing Olympics--


124
0:10:15,7 --> 0:10:18,97
if you look at them, a lot of
them are very short term.


125
0:10:18,97 --> 0:10:23,57
It's about shutting down
factories, and it's about


126
0:10:23,57 --> 0:10:27,72
having strict transport
restrictions.


127
0:10:27,72 --> 0:10:32,3
You would actually be much
more smart if we tried to


128
0:10:32,3 --> 0:10:36,33
think of long-term structural
solutions.


129
0:10:36,33 --> 0:10:41,5
As a Beijing citizen, if I would
have clean air for those


130
0:10:41,5 --> 0:10:45,75
two weeks in Beijing, and then
afterwards, I would think, why


131
0:10:45,75 --> 0:10:48,4
can't I have that
have every day?


132
0:10:48,4 --> 0:10:50,86
These are all things that can
lead to much long-term


133
0:10:50,86 --> 0:10:54,5
thinking after the Olympics.


134
0:10:54,5 --> 0:10:56,32
DAVID FEINBERG: A lot of people
say China is going


135
0:10:56,32 --> 0:10:59,55
through its own industrial
revolution, but I think that


136
0:10:59,55 --> 0:11:2,68
China's problem is kind
of a global problem.


137
0:11:2,68 --> 0:11:5,91
One of the biggest winners from
China's economic rise are


138
0:11:5,91 --> 0:11:8,77
the Americans and other
multinational companies who


139
0:11:8,77 --> 0:11:11,82
use cheap labor and materials to
produce goods that are sent


140
0:11:11,82 --> 0:11:13,91
all over the world.


141
0:11:13,91 --> 0:11:17,5
As big a mess as China has to
clean up, the United States is


142
0:11:17,5 --> 0:11:21,23
still the largest per-capita
polluter in the world.


143
0:11:21,23 --> 0:11:24,95
China's claims that the blue
skies have opened over Linfen


144
0:11:24,95 --> 0:11:29,22
is obviously false, especially
when you watch the sunset end


145
0:11:29,22 --> 0:11:32,42
about 20 minutes early, when
the sun sets behind an


146
0:11:32,42 --> 0:11:33,92

0:11:33,92 --> 0:11:39,69

However, once the sun goes down,
the stars do come out to

shine in Linfen.
