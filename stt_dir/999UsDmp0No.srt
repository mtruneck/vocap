2
0:0:36,8 --> 0:0:39,56
- Um, how much is this?
- £3.


3
0:0:39,56 --> 0:0:42,8
Ahh. Mmm...


4
0:0:42,8 --> 0:0:46,32
Is there something wrong
with your head?


5
0:0:46,32 --> 0:0:49,64
Are you wagging it to say no
or is it just uncontrollable?


6
0:0:49,64 --> 0:0:52,56
- Uh...
- You want the price put down?


7
0:0:52,56 --> 0:0:54,4
Well, I was thinking £2.


8
0:0:54,4 --> 0:0:59,88
Because £3 is just naked profiteering
for a book a mere...


9
0:0:59,88 --> 0:1:1,8
912 pages long?


10
0:1:1,8 --> 0:1:4,8
What'll I do with that extra pound?


11
0:1:4,8 --> 0:1:6,12
I'll add an acre to the grounds,


12
0:1:6,12 --> 0:1:9,36
I'll chuck some more koi carp
in my piano-shaped pond.


13
0:1:9,36 --> 0:1:13,4
No, I'll build a wing
on the National Gallery in my name.


14
0:1:13,4 --> 0:1:16,24
- 2.50.
- That's more like it.


15
0:1:16,24 --> 0:1:21,52
- Hm.
- Now you're being reasonable.


16
0:1:21,52 --> 0:1:23,8
2.50...


17
0:1:23,8 --> 0:1:26,64
gets you... this much,


18
0:1:26,64 --> 0:1:29,36
you can have the rest for the other 50p.


19
0:1:29,36 --> 0:1:35,96
- But you...
- Thank you.


20
0:1:35,96 --> 0:1:38,56
- Bernard...
- Don't start, customer lover.


21
0:1:38,56 --> 0:1:41,28
I was just gonna say
I'm off to get the paint.


22
0:1:41,28 --> 0:1:44,6
Why? The shop is the way it is
because it is the way it is.


23
0:1:44,6 --> 0:1:46,88
Otherwise it wouldn't be the way it is.


24
0:1:46,88 --> 0:1:50,48
- It needs doing.
- It has character.


25
0:1:50,48 --> 0:1:53,36
Character is an ambience, a feeling.


26
0:1:53,36 --> 0:1:56,76
It's not something with fur and a beak.


27
0:1:56,76 --> 0:2:1,16
(Scampering, grunting)


28
0:2:1,16 --> 0:2:5,36
(Anguished yowl)


29
0:2:5,36 --> 0:2:8,4
They've moved the nest again.


30
0:2:8,4 --> 0:2:10,96
I was gonna get two brushes, by the way.


31
0:2:10,96 --> 0:2:12,68
You can paint with both hands?


32
0:2:12,68 --> 0:2:15,72
- I was thinking...
- No, you just thought you were.


33
0:2:15,72 --> 0:2:17,44
- Well, maybe if...
- No!


34
0:2:17,44 --> 0:2:19,44
- But if...
- No!


35
0:2:19,44 --> 0:2:25,2
I don't want to be bothered,
you big, hairy...


36
0:2:25,2 --> 0:2:27,96
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.


37
0:2:27,96 --> 0:2:31,24
- What's the matter with you?
- Dunno.


38
0:2:31,24 --> 0:2:35,16
I'm just a big cloud of dunno.


39
0:2:35,16 --> 0:2:38,16
Since my shop closed
I feel empty all the time.


40
0:2:38,16 --> 0:2:39,68
You hated your shop.


41
0:2:39,68 --> 0:2:43,2
Yeah, but hating it took up my whole life.


42
0:2:43,2 --> 0:2:47,36
Without it I'm disconnected.
I buy things to cheer myself up.


43
0:2:47,36 --> 0:2:52,88
I go to get a paper
and I come back with all this.


44
0:2:52,88 --> 0:2:57,0
Chocolate, magazines.


45
0:2:57,0 --> 0:3:0,24
- And a Vauxhall Astra.
- Ah.


46
0:3:0,24 --> 0:3:3,8
Well, this is a very difficult
time for you, you know.


47
0:3:3,8 --> 0:3:6,2
You should get professional help.


48
0:3:6,2 --> 0:3:9,76
- So I should talk to a...
- Barman, yes. The pub, now.


49
0:3:9,76 --> 0:3:12,44
- It's that serious?
- Oh, yes.


50
0:3:12,44 --> 0:3:17,4
Manny, can you look after
the shop until Manny gets...


51
0:3:17,4 --> 0:3:22,84
You're not busy. Keep an eye
on the shop. For an hour.


52
0:3:22,84 --> 0:3:43,28
(Scampering, grunting)


53
0:3:43,28 --> 0:3:58,44
(Till chiming)


54
0:3:58,44 --> 0:4:0,48
(# Quiet classical)


55
0:4:0,48 --> 0:4:20,36
Sorry, wrong shop.


56
0:4:20,36 --> 0:4:22,4
Manny!


57
0:4:22,4 --> 0:4:35,44
(Cappuccino machine gurgling)


58
0:4:35,44 --> 0:4:39,64
Hello, sir. I am the information point.
Can I help you?


59
0:4:39,64 --> 0:4:43,68
I hope so. I was looking
for a pair of hobnail boots.


60
0:4:43,68 --> 0:4:46,52
I want to jump on somebody
who's ruining my life.


61
0:4:46,52 --> 0:4:48,72
I can explain. I went to get paint


62
0:4:48,72 --> 0:4:52,2
and I went to
that big bookshop, Saga Books.


63
0:4:52,2 --> 0:4:55,4
They had coffee and places to sit.


64
0:4:55,4 --> 0:4:57,84
I thought, "We need to
be more like them."


65
0:4:57,84 --> 0:5:1,32
I walked in and I instantly bought
£114 worth of books,


66
0:5:1,32 --> 0:5:3,16
all because it was so nice.


67
0:5:3,16 --> 0:5:6,64
Look at this.
A novel by a 12-year-old Spaniard.


68
0:5:6,64 --> 0:5:9,6
An account of
the Nazi space programme.


69
0:5:9,6 --> 0:5:11,28
- Er...
- This won't work!


70
0:5:11,28 --> 0:5:13,8
A large-print biography of Basil Brush.


71
0:5:13,8 --> 0:5:17,0
Actually, that's quite good.


72
0:5:17,0 --> 0:5:21,12
No one needs sofas that eat you.
No one needs information points.


73
0:5:21,12 --> 0:5:23,96
Fran did. She wanted
something to occupy her,


74
0:5:23,96 --> 0:5:26,6
so I suggested
she check out her family tree.


75
0:5:26,6 --> 0:5:29,92
And I informed her
of our new genealogy section.


76
0:5:29,92 --> 0:5:34,4
Hey right, if you trace it back,
and I might be wrong about this,


77
0:5:34,4 --> 0:5:36,12
I come from a very good line


78
0:5:36,12 --> 0:5:40,16
and apparently, I am Queen Victoria's...


79
0:5:40,16 --> 0:5:43,24
uncle.


80
0:5:43,24 --> 0:5:47,44
- I'll start again.
- It's all going back to how it was.


81
0:5:47,44 --> 0:5:49,96
Coffee and books is a fad.


82
0:5:49,96 --> 0:5:52,32
Nobody is gonna be fooled by this.


83
0:5:52,32 --> 0:5:54,52
Excuse me, could I have these, please?


84
0:5:54,52 --> 0:5:56,92
- They're £80.
- It's a lot, isn't it?


85
0:5:56,92 --> 0:6:0,2
But your information point
showed me where they were,


86
0:6:0,2 --> 0:6:3,76
I sat on your comfortable sofa
and scanned them and thought,


87
0:6:3,76 --> 0:6:9,36
"Oh, treat yourself."


88
0:6:9,36 --> 0:6:11,2
Come again!


89
0:6:11,2 --> 0:6:51,88
With coffee that good, I think I will.


90
0:6:51,88 --> 0:6:56,8
(Door opens)


91
0:6:56,8 --> 0:7:3,32
Bernard, Bernard, put your thing on.


92
0:7:3,32 --> 0:7:4,8
I'm back now.


93
0:7:4,8 --> 0:7:11,88
I KNOW!


94
0:7:11,88 --> 0:7:14,6
I've been to the shops.
That deserves a star.


95
0:7:14,6 --> 0:7:18,64
No, stars are for achievement.


96
0:7:18,64 --> 0:7:21,52
My 40th cigarette this afternoon,


97
0:7:21,52 --> 0:7:24,72
that deserves a star.


98
0:7:24,72 --> 0:7:33,84
(Scampering, grunting)


99
0:7:33,84 --> 0:7:37,4
(Squealing)


100
0:7:37,4 --> 0:7:39,0
OK, this is brilliant.


101
0:7:39,0 --> 0:7:41,12
I had another go at my family tree


102
0:7:41,12 --> 0:7:43,88
and I've got relatives
from eastern Europe


103
0:7:43,88 --> 0:7:46,12
living practically round the corner!


104
0:7:46,12 --> 0:7:48,16
- Is that news or what?
- Ooh.


105
0:7:48,16 --> 0:7:50,44
It's amazing, putting it together.


106
0:7:50,44 --> 0:7:53,6
Stop me if this gets boring.
You check the records...


107
0:7:53,6 --> 0:7:57,72
Stop.


108
0:7:57,72 --> 0:8:1,32
Well, I don't care. Because I've got roots.


109
0:8:1,32 --> 0:8:3,8
I don't need you.


110
0:8:3,8 --> 0:8:6,8
- Sorry to be such a BORE!
- (Feedback)


111
0:8:6,8 --> 0:8:11,8
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I am going to be with my people.


112
0:8:11,8 --> 0:8:34,76
(Squealing)


113
0:8:34,76 --> 0:8:36,48
Um...


114
0:8:36,48 --> 0:8:47,84
- poliknish.
- Poliknish!


115
0:8:47,84 --> 0:8:50,64
No, no, don't wipe.


116
0:8:50,64 --> 0:8:55,8
You've never had a traditional
Tishtayan kiss before.


117
0:8:55,8 --> 0:9:0,72
You poor girl!


118
0:9:0,72 --> 0:9:6,48
- Here she is.
- Oh, Fran! Poliknish!


119
0:9:6,48 --> 0:9:10,68
This is Frederic.


120
0:9:10,68 --> 0:9:17,24
Martina.


121
0:9:17,24 --> 0:9:19,76
- And Gregor.
- (Grunting)


122
0:9:19,76 --> 0:9:21,96
Naughty!


123
0:9:21,96 --> 0:9:26,36
- Our long-Iost cousin.
- Sit, Fran, sit.


124
0:9:26,36 --> 0:9:30,12
Drink bean tea with us.


125
0:9:30,12 --> 0:9:34,2
Oh, it's in a little glass.


126
0:9:34,2 --> 0:9:36,64
No, no, that's your right hand.


127
0:9:36,64 --> 0:9:39,28
That's how they drink tea in Athbekistan.


128
0:9:39,28 --> 0:9:50,2
Anyone who drinks tea
with their right hand is an enemy.


129
0:9:50,2 --> 0:9:52,2
Hooray.


130
0:9:52,2 --> 0:9:55,0
So, tell us all about yourself, Fran.


131
0:9:55,0 --> 0:9:59,32
- Well, I was born...
- Do you have a car?


132
0:9:59,32 --> 0:10:2,0
Yes. I mean, it's just an Astra.


133
0:10:2,0 --> 0:10:6,48
- (AII gasping)
- To have such a success in our family.


134
0:10:6,48 --> 0:10:12,0
Someone who owns an Astra!


135
0:10:12,0 --> 0:10:16,0
- (Whispering)
- P-Poliknish.


136
0:10:16,0 --> 0:10:22,64
Oh, isn't this nice?


137
0:10:22,64 --> 0:10:28,0
P-Poliknish.


138
0:10:28,0 --> 0:10:32,92
I have to have the rest of that book.
Here's that 50p.


139
0:10:32,92 --> 0:10:35,4
(Sighs)


140
0:10:35,4 --> 0:10:38,4
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.


141
0:10:38,4 --> 0:10:40,8
I was thinking £15.


142
0:10:40,8 --> 0:10:43,8
- What?
- No, you're right. 25.


143
0:10:43,8 --> 0:10:48,28
This is totally unfair.


144
0:10:48,28 --> 0:10:53,56
Mmm. Mmm.


145
0:10:53,56 --> 0:10:57,72
What you did contravenes
our Customer Code Promise Pledge.


146
0:10:57,72 --> 0:10:59,76
- What?
- If we're gonna compete,


147
0:10:59,76 --> 0:11:1,64
we must offer equal service.


148
0:11:1,64 --> 0:11:4,96
- That's why we made the CCPP.
- Oh, we did, did we?


149
0:11:4,96 --> 0:11:7,44
You were helping a customer at the time.


150
0:11:7,44 --> 0:11:11,68
The fellow with the red hair,
kept calling you Bern cos of your badge.


151
0:11:11,68 --> 0:11:16,44
That's quite funny, actually. Bern.


152
0:11:16,44 --> 0:11:19,16
One - the customer
is not only always right,


153
0:11:19,16 --> 0:11:21,8
he or she is also fun to be around.


154
0:11:21,8 --> 0:11:25,52
Remark on their wise choices
and laugh at their jokes.


155
0:11:25,52 --> 0:11:29,12
If you happen to be wearing
a top of lower cut than usual,


156
0:11:29,12 --> 0:11:33,12
- well, no harm done.
- Can't say it's not working.


157
0:11:33,12 --> 0:11:37,96
Two - if the sides of your head
don't hurt, smile more.


158
0:11:37,96 --> 0:11:40,16
Yes. More, more...


159
0:11:40,16 --> 0:11:45,16
No, that looks nasty.
Take it down. That's it.


160
0:11:45,16 --> 0:11:49,0
The management should have
regular meetings with the staff


161
0:11:49,0 --> 0:11:51,8
to sound out any grievances.


162
0:11:51,8 --> 0:11:52,88
- How's it going?
- Fine.


163
0:11:52,88 --> 0:11:56,68
Good. Meeting over.


164
0:11:56,68 --> 0:12:3,72
- Oh, look, you've popped out.
- (Snap)


165
0:12:3,72 --> 0:12:12,8
(Gasping, stammering)


166
0:12:12,8 --> 0:12:15,4
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- Nothing planned.


167
0:12:15,4 --> 0:12:19,36
Martina's moving into a new flat
and she needs a bit of help


168
0:12:19,36 --> 0:12:23,4
- and none of us have a car.
- Oh, no, no. I couldn't.


169
0:12:23,4 --> 0:12:26,52
- I'll help, no problem.
- Ta, ta.


170
0:12:26,52 --> 0:12:30,4
After that, there's some ham
I need to pick up from Folkestone.


171
0:12:30,4 --> 0:12:34,76
- Lots of ham.
- Folkestone?


172
0:12:34,76 --> 0:12:37,2
S-Sure, I'll take you, yeah.


173
0:12:37,2 --> 0:12:42,6
Hooray!


174
0:12:42,6 --> 0:12:45,36
Bernard, see that bloke
with the cappuccino?


175
0:12:45,36 --> 0:12:49,56
I sold him Ulysses, a Ulysses guide
and a handbook to the Ulysses guide.


176
0:12:49,56 --> 0:12:52,56
Can I have a star, please?


177
0:12:52,56 --> 0:12:57,32
You... can have... as many stars


178
0:12:57,32 --> 0:12:59,52
as you... like


179
0:12:59,52 --> 0:13:2,8
because I'm not doing this any more.


180
0:13:2,8 --> 0:13:6,12
I want less people in the shop.
If we're not reordering books,


181
0:13:6,12 --> 0:13:8,92
we're steaming milk
for the bambaccinos.


182
0:13:8,92 --> 0:13:11,0
We're like a high-street chain.


183
0:13:11,0 --> 0:13:18,16
They don't respect us
because we've given them everything.


184
0:13:18,16 --> 0:13:20,84
Wait a minute...


185
0:13:20,84 --> 0:13:22,96
Where did they go? What did we do?


186
0:13:22,96 --> 0:13:25,28
It's 12:45, they're getting food.


187
0:13:25,28 --> 0:13:27,0
Is our coffee not enough?


188
0:13:27,0 --> 0:13:29,96
- You wanted less people here.
- Don't twist my words.


189
0:13:29,96 --> 0:13:32,24
You said "less people in the shop".


190
0:13:32,24 --> 0:13:35,96
We can't let them leave.
We can feed them. Lunch and dinner.


191
0:13:35,96 --> 0:13:38,16
And we'll build a pool. And a gym!


192
0:13:38,16 --> 0:13:42,4
And an Egyptian-style casino.
No, that's a bit much.


193
0:13:42,4 --> 0:13:45,52
But if they could eat,
they'd stay and buy books all day.


194
0:13:45,52 --> 0:13:48,68
From now on,
we run a full restaurant service.


195
0:13:48,68 --> 0:13:52,4
Do your friends at Saga Books
do that, huh? I don't think so.


196
0:13:52,4 --> 0:13:55,8
- We can't run a restaurant.
- Course we can.


197
0:13:55,8 --> 0:13:59,88
Because from now on, the only stars
we'll be looking at will be Dunlop stars!


198
0:13:59,88 --> 0:14:4,88
- Michelin stars.
- Them as well!


199
0:14:4,88 --> 0:14:16,6
(Laughter)


200
0:14:16,6 --> 0:14:20,12
Oh, I'm tired, Grandma.
Can I have a cold drink, please?


201
0:14:20,12 --> 0:14:24,48
Oh, Fran, what you need
is some hot bean tea, eh?


202
0:14:24,48 --> 0:14:26,44
(Chuckling)


203
0:14:26,44 --> 0:14:32,16
I'm sorry I couldn't help with the hams
but it musses up my hair.


204
0:14:32,16 --> 0:14:35,92
I, uh, I think I'll go home, get to bed.


205
0:14:35,92 --> 0:14:40,96
Yes, rest, Fran. Then on Saturday
you'll take Gregor to the hospital.


206
0:14:40,96 --> 0:14:43,6
It's a little out of the way - Aberdeen.


207
0:14:43,6 --> 0:14:45,88
Oh, no, no, I can't.


208
0:14:45,88 --> 0:14:48,8
Take a jiffy, maybe two little jiffies.


209
0:14:48,8 --> 0:14:51,64
I can't, because I'm...


210
0:14:51,64 --> 0:14:55,12
I'm giving a talk.
At the London School of Economics.


211
0:14:55,12 --> 0:14:57,96
And also, I have to have a bath.


212
0:14:57,96 --> 0:15:3,8
Let me explain, Fran.


213
0:15:3,8 --> 0:15:8,0
Any one member of the family
is like this bean.


214
0:15:8,0 --> 0:15:13,76
But the family is tightly bound,
like this sausage.


215
0:15:13,76 --> 0:15:18,48
And if one member
does not help the family,


216
0:15:18,48 --> 0:15:24,0
well...


217
0:15:24,0 --> 0:15:42,24
Saturday, you drive.


218
0:15:42,24 --> 0:15:44,0
Have you got the lobsters?


219
0:15:44,0 --> 0:15:46,88
Put them in the pot.


220
0:15:46,88 --> 0:15:51,4
- What's it gonna be?
- Our signature dish - luxury pie.


221
0:15:51,4 --> 0:15:53,2
The food of kings.


222
0:15:53,2 --> 0:15:55,92
Truffles, saffron,


223
0:15:55,92 --> 0:15:59,68
caviar... and champagne.


224
0:15:59,68 --> 0:16:11,36
Drizzle it, drizzle it.


225
0:16:11,36 --> 0:16:12,96
(Sniffing deeply)


226
0:16:12,96 --> 0:16:14,8
Mmmmm.


227
0:16:14,8 --> 0:16:18,64
Rich. OK, starter's done.


228
0:16:18,64 --> 0:16:20,92
- Now for the mains.
- (Scampering)


229
0:16:20,92 --> 0:16:24,6
The food's attracting those creatures.
They've got bigger.


230
0:16:24,6 --> 0:16:26,64
Look, he's got an onion!


231
0:16:26,64 --> 0:16:31,16
All the best kitchens are dirty.
Slice the garlic.


232
0:16:31,16 --> 0:16:33,12
They're getting huge.


233
0:16:33,12 --> 0:16:37,4
We'll soon be able to saddle 'em up
and ride into town.


234
0:16:37,4 --> 0:16:40,4
I'm not totally convinced
we should open as a restaurant


235
0:16:40,4 --> 0:16:42,76
and if we do - and I'm not entirely sure -


236
0:16:42,76 --> 0:16:45,92
I don't think we should open tonight.


237
0:16:45,92 --> 0:16:53,84
Shut up. I'm trying to make crème brûlée.


238
0:16:53,84 --> 0:16:55,28
Must you drink so much?


239
0:16:55,28 --> 0:16:59,16
How else will we get candles
in empty wine bottles?


240
0:16:59,16 --> 0:17:3,16
Here's two for you, get stuck in.


241
0:17:3,16 --> 0:17:6,56
Why are you talking in English?
Only French in my kitchen.


242
0:17:6,56 --> 0:17:12,52
- Il n'y a pas d'anything else.
- (Creatures grunting)


243
0:17:12,52 --> 0:17:15,68
Putain!


244
0:17:15,68 --> 0:17:17,88
Mine, I think.


245
0:17:17,88 --> 0:17:30,2
- I'm in trouble, I need advice.
- Hang on.


246
0:17:30,2 --> 0:17:32,52
- Right.
- That family I found.


247
0:17:32,52 --> 0:17:36,8
I met them, became one of them
and I want to get rid of them.


248
0:17:36,8 --> 0:17:39,72
Right.


249
0:17:39,72 --> 0:17:44,36
And you got me into it. So
Mr Information Man, how do I get out?


250
0:17:44,36 --> 0:17:50,32
OK. What about this?


251
0:17:50,32 --> 0:17:53,84
- Fran!
- How's the car?


252
0:17:53,84 --> 0:17:55,68
Never better.


253
0:17:55,68 --> 0:17:58,28
Ooh, tea.


254
0:17:58,28 --> 0:18:0,4
(AII gasping)


255
0:18:0,4 --> 0:18:5,28
Oh! My right hand, how awful.


256
0:18:5,28 --> 0:18:10,76
Oh, I'll make it up to you, by singing
the Tishtayan national anthem.


257
0:18:10,76 --> 0:18:12,4
I've been practising it.


258
0:18:12,4 --> 0:18:14,4
Ahem.


259
0:18:14,4 --> 0:18:21,92
(# Sings deeply and off-key)


260
0:18:21,92 --> 0:18:26,4
No, no, that's the Athbekistan
national anthem -


261
0:18:26,4 --> 0:18:29,64
that verse mocks our country's
nuclear power facilities.


262
0:18:29,64 --> 0:18:33,36
Well, you'll have to disown
me now, won't you?


263
0:18:33,36 --> 0:18:38,2
People with Astras can drink with their
right hand and sing whatever they like.


264
0:18:38,2 --> 0:18:41,52
That's how it's been for centuries.


265
0:18:41,52 --> 0:18:44,68
So, we forgive you.


266
0:18:44,68 --> 0:18:52,4
Let's celebrate with a drive
around town and an up-slap meal.


267
0:18:52,4 --> 0:19:0,4
- Where's the thing?
- On top of the thing!


268
0:19:0,4 --> 0:19:2,64
Blancmange is always so fiddly.


269
0:19:2,64 --> 0:19:6,16
Gourmet food is always presented
in little towers. What's that?


270
0:19:6,16 --> 0:19:8,6
- Soup.
- Well, get it in a tower.


271
0:19:8,6 --> 0:19:12,96
You're a cook, you have to commit.
Show me your hands.


272
0:19:12,96 --> 0:19:15,56
Cooks have burns.


273
0:19:15,56 --> 0:19:17,32
We're cooks.


274
0:19:17,32 --> 0:19:19,76
I'll do it to myself... later.


275
0:19:19,76 --> 0:19:24,88
Come on, quickly, quickly!


276
0:19:24,88 --> 0:19:28,96
Come on!


277
0:19:28,96 --> 0:19:35,8
- Fran, our food's very late.
- Fran, make food come.


278
0:19:35,8 --> 0:19:37,32
Manny, I can't get rid of them.


279
0:19:37,32 --> 0:19:41,16
- Fran, be a waitress.
- No, I'm sick of doing favours.


280
0:19:41,16 --> 0:19:42,64
- I can pay you.
- Really?


281
0:19:42,64 --> 0:19:44,88
- No.
- OK.


282
0:19:44,88 --> 0:19:46,88
Take this out to table 12...


283
0:19:46,88 --> 0:19:48,64
No, there are no plates.


284
0:19:48,64 --> 0:19:50,52
Well, use...


285
0:19:50,52 --> 0:19:53,0
recipe books with pictures of plates!


286
0:19:53,0 --> 0:19:58,48
Do I have to explain everything here?


287
0:19:58,48 --> 0:20:0,32
Not enough mint.


288
0:20:0,32 --> 0:20:8,8
Manny, do you have
a tower of soup for me?


289
0:20:8,8 --> 0:20:10,88
What's this? Where are the turrets?


290
0:20:10,88 --> 0:20:13,68
It's rubbish, start again!


291
0:20:13,68 --> 0:20:16,76
- Where are my ingredients?
- We've cooked them all!


292
0:20:16,76 --> 0:20:18,8
I don't care!


293
0:20:18,8 --> 0:20:21,56
I can make a feast
from anything. This paint.


294
0:20:21,56 --> 0:20:25,32
This paint will make a tasty dish.


295
0:20:25,32 --> 0:20:29,76
My oven can cook anything,
my oven can cook...


296
0:20:29,76 --> 0:20:32,96
bits of oven.


297
0:20:32,96 --> 0:20:35,92
Yes. Yes!


298
0:20:35,92 --> 0:20:46,8
Yes, oh yes, oh yes.


299
0:20:46,8 --> 0:20:49,44
Excellent food at reasonable prices -
it's not that hard.


300
0:20:49,44 --> 0:20:52,24
Is everyone finished being sick yet?


301
0:20:52,24 --> 0:20:54,92
(Woman moaning)


302
0:20:54,92 --> 0:20:58,4
No, I think Grandma
has some way still to go.


303
0:20:58,4 --> 0:21:2,12
(Moaning)


304
0:21:2,12 --> 0:21:4,24
I brought you here.


305
0:21:4,24 --> 0:21:7,64
You all got food poisoning.
It's all my fault.


306
0:21:7,64 --> 0:21:10,28
I can't ask you to forgive me now.


307
0:21:10,28 --> 0:21:15,44
The bonds of third cousinhood
can never be broken.


308
0:21:15,44 --> 0:21:18,4
Now, you take us home.


309
0:21:18,4 --> 0:21:27,52
Wait a minute.


310
0:21:27,52 --> 0:21:31,36
(Glass shatters)


311
0:21:31,36 --> 0:21:48,4
Oh, no!
Something terrible has happened.


312
0:21:48,4 --> 0:21:52,12
Someone set fire to the car!


313
0:21:52,12 --> 0:21:57,44
Still, I know that
in this moment of hardship,


314
0:21:57,44 --> 0:22:0,44
my family will stick by me.


315
0:22:0,44 --> 0:22:12,36
The...


316
0:22:12,36 --> 0:22:19,8
No, no, they didn't go there,
they went over there.


317
0:22:19,8 --> 0:22:21,28
We're a book shop, Manny.


318
0:22:21,28 --> 0:22:24,96
- What is wrong with that?
- Yeah.


319
0:22:24,96 --> 0:22:27,84
Trying to be a restaurant,
what were we thinking?


320
0:22:27,84 --> 0:22:31,4
- Yeah.
- (Scampering and grunting)


321
0:22:31,4 --> 0:22:34,24
With the bloody sofa
and the stupid coffee.


322
0:22:34,24 --> 0:22:40,16
Ridiculous. The place is lovely as it is.


323
0:22:40,16 --> 0:22:43,56
Oh, I'm free.


324
0:22:43,56 --> 0:22:47,96
Anyway, my friends
have always been my real family.


325
0:22:47,96 --> 0:22:50,0
- What do you want?
- Tenner.


326
0:22:50,0 --> 0:22:53,84
- For a taxi to my evening class.
- What are you doing?


327
0:22:53,84 --> 0:22:58,84
Persian Cats Throughout
French History, just to fill the time.


328
0:22:58,84 --> 0:23:3,0
(Mewing, grunting)


329
0:23:3,0 --> 0:23:6,96
(Snorting)


330
0:23:6,96 --> 0:23:11,76
(Squealing)


331
0:23:11,76 --> 0:23:19,0
I did it. I got the queen.


332
