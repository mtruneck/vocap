###14 SIMON OSTROVSKY: After spending the night in Tel
###16 Aviv, it was time to head back to the West Bank for a
###19 Palestinian protest, which was only about 30 miles away, but
###23 things are never as easy as they sound.
###26 In addition to all the usual barriers between Israel and
###29 the Palestinian territories, the heavens had conspired to
###33 shut down traffic across Tel Aviv for the annual marathon.
###37 This was a celebration of fitness that I
###40 hadn't prepared for.
###41 
###43 It's Friday morning in Tel Aviv.
###45 We're going to the West Bank where it's Land Day, and all
###50 of Palestine celebrates their land.
###53 But it's also an occasion when they clash with Israeli
###56 troops, so we're going to see what that vibe is like.
###59 We're having to carry all of our stuff across the entire
###61 city, and frankly, it's really pissing me off.
###64 
###68 This is the Qalandia checkpoint.
###70 There's tons of soldiers and police here today because
###73 they're expecting a confrontation with the
###77 Palestinian demonstrators.
###79 We're going across the checkpoint while we can
###81 because once the trouble starts, they're
###84 going to shut it down.
###85 
###90 Oh, man.
###91 Not another one.
###92 You've got to be kidding me.
###94 
###98 OK.
###98 Now I'm pretty sure we're here.
###101 Three hours after we set out from Tel Aviv, we were finally
###104 in the seat of the Palestinian Authority--
###106 Ramallah.
###108 We met Tawfiq Haddad, a Palestinian-American who'd
###112 agreed to take us on a sporting event
###114 of a different kind.
###115 
###121 Palestinians were marking Land Day, an annual event that
###125 draws attention to the fact that the territory they
###127 control keeps shrinking and shrinking in inverse
###130 proportion to the amount of land controlled by Israel and
###133 its settlers.
###134 JAMAL JUMA: Land [INAUDIBLE] for the Palestinians
###137 [INAUDIBLE].
###138 When the Palestinian land has been taken, Palestinians
###140 became refugees around the world because the Zionists
###143 have been expelled them from their land in '48.
###145 We are still, until now, suffering from--
###148 in the diaspora--
###149 from this refugee problem.
###150 They want to keep their occupation and
###152 colonization forever.
###153 This is not going to happen.
###154 SIMON OSTROVSKY: But their politicians say they want to
###156 have a two-state solution.
###157 JAMAL JUMA: This is lip services.
###159 If you really, as a politician, want two-state
###161 solution, prove it on the ground.
###163 Stop your settlements.
###164 Take out your settlers from the West Bank and Jerusalem,
###166 and stop demolishing the houses and the ethnic
###169 cleansing and confiscating the land.
###172 Stop the wall that you are building.
###173 Then we can believe that you want two-state solution.

###185 SIMON OSTROVSKY: The protests were taking place at the
###187 Qalandia checkpoint that I'd crossed through earlier.
###191 And Israel's security forces were determined not to let any
###194 of the Palestinians near it.
###198 Meanwhile, a local cell phone company decided that the
###201 madness erupting all around was the perfect place to
###204 advertise its services.
###206 So the funny thing is while this protest is going on,
###209 somebody's handing out these hats.
###211 And what these actually are are from the local cell phone
###214 company because apparently, Palestinians never miss an
###218 opportunity to do some direct marketing.
###219 MALE SPEAKER: What are they fucking-- people are going to
###222 die today and they just want them to be
###223 wearing the Jawwal hat?
###225 
###228 Land Day demonstrations like this one were taking place all
###231 around the West Bank and along the borders of Israel and
###234 Syria-Lebanon and in Gaza, where one of the protesters,
###238 just 20 years old, was shot dead as he approached an
###241 Israeli crossing.
###242 But I'd heard that Palestinian demonstrators weren't the only
###245 ones in the habit of throwing stones, so I headed to an
###248 ordinary Palestinian town a bit further away from all the
###252 commotion to hear their side of the story.
