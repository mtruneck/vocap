0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:2,77



2
0:0:2,77 --> 0:0:4,3
HARRY CHEADLE: My name is Harry,
and I've been a loser


3
0:0:4,3 --> 0:0:5,54
for most of my life.


4
0:0:5,54 --> 0:0:7,88
I thought I was done with my
awkward phase when Vice hired


5
0:0:7,88 --> 0:0:10,52
me to write about politics,
culture, and other important


6
0:0:10,52 --> 0:0:12,8
world affairs, which should
make me cool.


7
0:0:12,8 --> 0:0:14,1
But it doesn't.


8
0:0:14,1 --> 0:0:16,32
I'm still just a weird kid
who creeps people out.


9
0:0:16,32 --> 0:0:19,88
This is "All Around Losing"
with Harry Cheadle.


10
0:0:19,88 --> 0:0:22,24
This season on "All
Around Losing"--


11
0:0:22,24 --> 0:0:24,886



12
0:0:24,886 --> 0:0:28,585
Whoa, who's going to
get laid tonight?


13
0:0:28,585 --> 0:0:31,21
Guns are basically just
giant metal penises


14
0:0:31,21 --> 0:0:32,553
that ejaculate death.


15
0:0:32,553 --> 0:0:37,685



16
0:0:37,685 --> 0:0:39,1
INSTRUCTOR: You feel
comfortable?


17
0:0:39,1 --> 0:0:39,52
HARRY CHEADLE: Uh.


18
0:0:39,52 --> 0:0:40,7
INSTRUCTOR: Don't lie to me.


19
0:0:40,7 --> 0:0:42,67
HARRY CHEADLE: Let me talk more
about sex for a second.


20
0:0:42,67 --> 0:0:46,33



21
0:0:46,33 --> 0:0:48,372
HARRY CHEADLE: That's how
my life usually goes.


22
0:0:48,372 --> 0:0:51,6



23
0:0:51,6 --> 0:0:53,9
This is going to go really bad.


24
0:0:53,9 --> 0:2:53,9
