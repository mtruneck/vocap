###7 Welcome to DoDEA News in a Minute.
###9 Since it's beginning in 1989, millions of students in grades 4th through 8th
###13 have competed each year for a twenty-five thousand dollar college scholarship,
###15 and the honor of being crowned the National Geographic Bee Champion.
###18 Winners of the state-level competitions met in Washington late last month.
###22 Representing DoDEA this year was Gavin Moulton, a 7th Grade student from
###25 Naples American Middle School in Naples, Italy.
###28 While in the Nation's Capitol, the Moulton family toured DoDEA Headquarters,
###32 and met with Deputy Director Charlie Toth.
###35 Moulton, who placed a respectable 16th in this year's event,
###37 had one piece of advice for future competitors.
###39 "Study, study, study.  If you want to do well, you have to study.
###43 Many kids there spend a lot of their time and they're very, very, very smart.
###49 I mean if you watched any of the DVD's they had of the finals,
###52 you can tell that all the kids are very, very smart."
###54 National Geographic Channel will air the BEE competition over
###57 four nights beginning Monday, June 13th.
###59 That's all for this edition of DoDEA News in a Minute, thanks for watching.
