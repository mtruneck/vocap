BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:
We have endured too many of these tragedies


2
0:0:13,19 --> 0:0:21,33
in the past few years, and each time I learn
the news, I react not as a president, but


3
0:0:21,33 --> 0:0:27,72
as anybody else would, as a parent. And that
was especially true today.

CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: President Obama speaking
last Friday about a shooting at Sandy Hook


6
0:0:32,719 --> 0:0:36,889
elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut.
We`re going to be focusing exclusively on


7
0:0:36,889 --> 0:0:38,769
that story today.


8
0:0:38,769 --> 0:0:43,46
There are a lot of questions about what happened
on Friday. Right now, there aren`t very many


9
0:0:43,46 --> 0:0:47,479
answers. As people struggle to understand
this tragedy, they are mourning the victims


10
0:0:47,479 --> 0:0:53,129
who lost their lives and looking for ways
to honor those victims and support their families.


11
0:0:53,129 --> 0:0:57,549
President Obama ordered the flag at the U.S.
Capitol building and at all U.S. Government


12
0:0:57,549 --> 0:1:1,839
buildings to be lowered to half-staff on Friday.
Governors across the country asked for flags


13
0:1:1,839 --> 0:1:6,71
in their states to be lowered as well. Messages
of sympathy for the shooting victims came


14
0:1:6,71 --> 0:1:11,53
in from all over the world. A lot of people
shared similar thoughts on social media.


15
0:1:11,53 --> 0:1:16,14
In the community of Newtown where this happened,
services and candle-light vigils like this


16
0:1:16,14 --> 0:1:20,659
one had been going on since Friday night.
There has been an emotional reaction to the


17
0:1:20,659 --> 0:1:24,789
shooting, as you might expect, and you could
see some of that emotion from President Obama


18
0:1:24,789 --> 0:1:26,31
when he talked about it on Friday.

20
0:1:27,479 --> 0:1:34,249
OBAMA: I know there is not a parent in America
who doesn`t feel the same overwhelming grief


21
0:1:34,249 --> 0:1:42,7
that I do. The majority of those who died
today were children, beautiful little kids


22
0:1:42,7 --> 0:2:2,249
between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They
had their entire lives ahead of them - birthdays,


23
0:2:2,249 --> 0:2:15,37
graduations, weddings, kids of their own.
Among the fallen were also teachers, men and


24
0:2:15,37 --> 0:2:21,19
women who devoted their lives to helping our
children fulfill their dreams. So our hearts


25
0:2:21,19 --> 0:2:30,54
are broken today for the parents and grandparents,
sisters and brothers of these little children,


26
0:2:30,54 --> 0:2:32,58
and for the families of the adults who were
lost.

28
0:2:33,689 --> 0:2:38,15
AZUZ: 26 people from Sandy Hook elementary
were killed on Friday. Earlier this year,


29
0:2:38,15 --> 0:2:42,76
the principal put in a new security system.
It locks the doors at 9:30, and it requires


30
0:2:42,76 --> 0:2:47,95
visitors to be identified and then buzzed
in. Officials say the alleged shooter, 20-year-old


31
0:2:47,95 --> 0:2:52,7
Adam Lanza, used a gun to force his way into
the building, a gun authorities say belonged


32
0:2:52,7 --> 0:2:56,34
to his mother, whom he`s also accused of shooting.


33
0:2:56,34 --> 0:3:1,819
Around 9:30 Friday morning, witnesses reported
hearing gunshots inside Sandy Hook elementary.


34
0:3:1,819 --> 0:3:7,31
Police say the gunman opened fire in two classrooms
after killing the principal and school psychologist


35
0:3:7,31 --> 0:3:12,1
in the hallway. Officials said the shooter
eventually took his own life. The attack claimed


36
0:3:12,1 --> 0:3:17,909
the lives of 20 students, all 6- or 7-year-olds,
and six adults, and left the community of


37
0:3:17,909 --> 0:3:24,54
Newtown, Connecticut in shock.

0:3:30,99 --> 0:3:48,12
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Just a tragic, tragic
situation for the teachers, the principals,


40
0:3:48,12 --> 0:4:3,549
and those angels, that`s all I keep thinking
about is those angels.


41
0:4:3,549 --> 0:4:28,67
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When things happen to
your children, and to other people`s children,


42
0:4:28,67 --> 0:5:23,59
I can`t look at my children`s faces now without
seeing the faces of every one of their schoolmates.

44
0:5:40,7 --> 0:6:1,47
AZUZ: The shooting at Sandy Hook elementary
is a story of violence and tragedy. It`s also


45
0:6:1,47 --> 0:6:6,4
a story of heroism. Certainly the police and
emergency workers who responded to this attack,


46
0:6:6,4 --> 0:6:11,75
but especially the teachers and administrators
at Sandy Hook and their actions last Friday.


47
0:6:11,75 --> 0:6:16,35
When one kindergarten teacher heard shots,
she locked her classroom door, took her students


48
0:6:16,35 --> 0:6:21,56
to a safe area in the back of the room, and
read to them in order to keep them calm. A


49
0:6:21,56 --> 0:6:25,82
first-grade teacher ushered her students into
the class bathroom and then keep them there


50
0:6:25,82 --> 0:6:30,44
until the police came to evacuate them. Another
first-grade teacher moved her students into


51
0:6:30,44 --> 0:6:35,12
a corner away from the door. When the gunman
came into the room, the teacher stood in front


52
0:6:35,12 --> 0:6:38,76
of the students, protecting them while sacrificing
her life.

GOV. DANNEL MALLOY, D-CONNECTICUT: In this
time of troubles and travails, when the unthinkable


55
0:6:46,34 --> 0:6:57,41
happens in our very midst, our faith is tested.
Not just in the religious sense, not just


56
0:6:57,41 --> 0:7:4,39
necessarily our faith in God, but our faith
in community and who we are and what we collectively


57
0:7:4,39 --> 0:7:13,75
are. And it`s in so many ways permissible
to have those thoughts and those doubts about


58
0:7:13,75 --> 0:7:19,4
who we are and what we are and what community
represents, but then we turn to understand,


59
0:7:19,4 --> 0:7:27,72
as we turn around this room, and recognizes
our friends and our neighbors, those we have


60
0:7:27,72 --> 0:7:35,62
done things for and those who have done things
for us. This is a great and beautiful community,


61
0:7:35,62 --> 0:7:40,77
located in a great and beautiful state and
a great and beautiful nation.

AZUZ: There are a number of organizations
that are working to help the community of


64
0:7:45,65 --> 0:7:50,94
Newtown. Some are fund raising, some are offering
counseling and other services to families.


65
0:7:50,94 --> 0:7:55,4
Some are collecting messages of support. CNN

66
0:7:55,4 --> 0:7:59,77

to come together to help the families that


71
0:8:18,69 --> 0:8:22,72
were hurt and affected by the shooting. We
need to put the focus on them and helping


72
0:8:22,72 --> 0:8:26,8

we must now begin to heal and ensure that

From Kelsey, "I`m proud of all the brave teachers
who risked their lives to save those poor

0:8:45,31 --> 0:8:46,829
little kids."


79
0:8:46,829 --> 0:8:51,16
From Chris, who is a teacher. "No student
or teacher should have to fear going to school.


80
0:8:51,16 --> 0:8:53,61
My heart goes out to everyone in that community."


81
0:8:53,61 --> 0:8:57,72
And from Alicia, "I think the whole nation`s
thoughts, prayers and love should go straight


82
0:8:57,72 --> 0:9:2,73
to the families affected by this tragedy."
Alicia, I could not agree more. I join everyone


83
0:9:2,73 --> 0:9:6,12
who is praying for this community and for
all of you around the world who`ve been affected


84
0:9:6,12 --> 0:9:10,399
by this. We know many of you still have a
lot of questions. We have a lot of questions.


85
0:9:10,399 --> 0:11:10,399
But we`ll continue searching for answers in
the days ahead.
