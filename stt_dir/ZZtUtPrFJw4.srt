1
0:0:35,0 --> 0:0:36,919
- Way to go, champ!
- Wow!


2
0:0:36,919 --> 0:0:38,719
Neutral corner!


3
0:0:38,719 --> 0:0:42,0
One, two, three, four, five--
All right.


4
0:0:42,0 --> 0:0:43,918
Let's go!


5
0:0:43,918 --> 0:0:56,716
- You got him, champ!
- Let's go!


6
0:0:56,716 --> 0:1:8,475
- Hit him again, champ!
- Break! Take him to his corner.


7
0:1:8,475 --> 0:1:10,435
The champ is really awesome.


8
0:1:10,435 --> 0:1:13,33
No one has even lasted five rounds
in his last eight fights.


9
0:1:13,33 --> 0:1:14,833
He's definitely the eliminator.


10
0:1:14,833 --> 0:1:19,513
Watch this kid.
He's goin' down in this round.


11
0:1:19,513 --> 0:1:33,991
- You can do it, champ!
- Let's fight!


12
0:1:33,991 --> 0:1:39,228
- Yeah, champ!
- You're the best!


13
0:1:39,228 --> 0:1:46,668
- You got it, champ!
- That's it. It's over.


14
0:1:46,668 --> 0:1:50,308
The winner in 38 seconds
of the fourth round...


15
0:1:50,308 --> 0:1:53,707
and still heavyweight champion
of the world...


16
0:1:53,707 --> 0:2:4,265
Eric "the Eliminator" Stone!


17
0:2:4,265 --> 0:2:6,864
Hey, champ, how come you don't
use a trainer anymore?


18
0:2:6,864 --> 0:2:9,744
Got my kid brother in my corner for now.
He says he's going to be a vet.


19
0:2:9,744 --> 0:2:12,864
I say he's going to be a lawyer,
or I'm gonna kick his butt!


20
0:2:12,864 --> 0:2:15,863
Now that you've beaten everyone
there is to beat, what's next?


21
0:2:15,863 --> 0:2:18,104
Take on the worldís best.
Show 'em who's boss.


22
0:2:18,104 --> 0:2:20,23
- What about Thailand?
- What about it?


23
0:2:20,23 --> 0:2:23,302
I understand kickboxing was invented
there, and they're the best at it.


24
0:2:23,302 --> 0:2:28,181
Oh, really? Kid, book us a flight
to Taiwan, first.


25
0:2:28,181 --> 0:2:31,141
- Bangkok.
- Bangkok, Taiwan, Tokyo--


26
0:2:31,141 --> 0:4:59,837
What's the difference?
I'm kickin' ass wherever I go.


27
0:4:59,837 --> 0:5:1,156
See ya, kid.


28
0:5:1,156 --> 0:5:4,395
Just don't forget,
you're fighting your champ next week.


29
0:5:4,395 --> 0:5:6,316
I know. I'm ready.
Don't worry.


30
0:5:6,316 --> 0:5:8,916
- Watch your wallet.
- She doesn't want my wallet.


31
0:5:8,916 --> 0:5:19,233
She wants to make it
with the champ.


32
0:5:19,233 --> 0:5:21,952
You sure had it easy
with Mom in Europe.


33
0:5:21,952 --> 0:5:23,873
Dad never let up.


34
0:5:23,873 --> 0:5:28,431
If I wasn't the best at every sport
l played, he'd call me a loser.


35
0:5:28,431 --> 0:5:30,591
He was always on my case...


36
0:5:30,591 --> 0:5:34,151
but he made me strong.


37
0:5:34,151 --> 0:5:38,31
You know, Eric, Mom,
she was a very special lady too.


38
0:5:38,31 --> 0:5:40,231
She wanted me
to learn three languages...


39
0:5:40,231 --> 0:5:44,949
to take ballet,
before I learned karate.


40
0:5:44,949 --> 0:5:48,188
I really miss her.


41
0:5:48,188 --> 0:5:52,227
I wish they wouldíve been there
to see me win the championship.


42
0:5:52,227 --> 0:5:55,148
Well, big brother,
they could never get along.


43
0:5:55,148 --> 0:5:57,226
But I'm glad we do.


44
0:5:57,226 --> 0:6:0,987
- They'd be proud.
- Yeah.


45
0:6:0,987 --> 0:6:4,146
You're right, kid. Kurt!


46
0:6:4,146 --> 0:6:24,183
Come on.


47
0:6:24,183 --> 0:6:25,662
Damn it, kid!


48
0:6:25,662 --> 0:6:29,581
How many times do I have to tell ya?
You don't win with that "tip tap" shit.


49
0:6:29,581 --> 0:6:32,61
Power. Power kicks.


50
0:6:32,61 --> 0:6:34,261
Take your gloves off.
Let's go hit the pads.


51
0:6:34,261 --> 0:6:47,78
Come on.


52
0:6:47,78 --> 0:6:53,338
That's power, kid.


53
0:6:53,338 --> 0:6:56,618
Whoa! Take it easy.


54
0:6:56,618 --> 0:7:11,976
Got to learn, kid.
Come on.


55
0:7:11,976 --> 0:7:14,494
Hi. Welcome to Bangkok.


56
0:7:14,494 --> 0:7:16,974
Thanks.


57
0:7:16,974 --> 0:7:20,773
How do you feel about
fighting our champ Tong Po?


58
0:7:20,773 --> 0:7:23,172
- Piece of cake.
- Think so?


59
0:7:23,172 --> 0:7:57,168
Think you're going to win
this time?


60
0:7:57,168 --> 0:7:59,527
Where's the goddamn ice
in this dump?


61
0:7:59,527 --> 0:8:3,607
- Go get me some, huh?
- Okay.


62
0:8:3,607 --> 0:8:6,486
Hey, how much time we got?


63
0:8:6,486 --> 0:8:11,685
About 30 minutes.


64
0:8:11,685 --> 0:8:14,165
You never fought this style before.
It's so different.


65
0:8:14,165 --> 0:8:18,44
Hey, a punch is a punch.
A kick's a kick. We came to fight.


66
0:8:18,44 --> 0:9:22,194
Get me some ice, will ya?
Let's go.


67
0:9:22,194 --> 0:9:31,192
Where the hell you been?
Gimme the ice.


68
0:9:31,192 --> 0:9:32,912
Eric, don't do it.


69
0:9:32,912 --> 0:9:35,472
I saw the look in his eyes.
This guy's crazy.


70
0:9:35,472 --> 0:9:40,75
- He's fucking crazy!
- Good. The crowd'll love it.


71
0:9:40,75 --> 0:9:43,59
- You don't understand.
- No, you don't understand, kid.


72
0:9:43,59 --> 0:9:46,869
I'm the best. This is just
another chance for me to prove it.


73
0:9:46,869 --> 0:9:50,31
So watch and learn.
It's all in the legs.


74
0:9:50,31 --> 0:9:51,509
Legs!


75
0:9:51,509 --> 0:9:56,67
This guy was kicking one of these
with his fucking legs.


76
0:9:56,67 --> 0:9:58,229
The dust was failing down.


77
0:9:58,229 --> 0:10:4,186
So what?
Can he move like me?


78
0:10:4,186 --> 0:10:8,585
No. We got him.


79
0:10:8,585 --> 0:10:12,465
Eric, please, I've got
a bad feeing about this one.


80
0:10:12,465 --> 0:10:16,65
- Hey!
- Trust me. Don't fight this guy.


81
0:10:16,65 --> 0:10:18,944
Hey! I brought you here
to work my corner.


82
0:10:18,944 --> 0:10:31,701
What's your problem? You're either
with me, or go the fuck home.


83
0:10:31,701 --> 0:10:40,54
We're family.
Let's kick some ass. Come on.


84
0:10:40,54 --> 0:12:31,442
Okay. Let's go, champ.


85
0:12:31,442 --> 0:12:41,41
No!


86
0:12:41,41 --> 0:13:5,157
Stop!


87
0:13:5,157 --> 0:13:8,916
- Fuckin' music's drivin' me crazy.
- Let's forget about the music.


88
0:13:8,916 --> 0:13:11,717
Did you see that?
He got me with an elbow.


89
0:13:11,717 --> 0:13:14,516
That's the way they fight here.
I told you.


90
0:13:14,516 --> 0:13:17,394
Motherfucker wants to street fight?
I'll show him.


91
0:13:17,394 --> 0:13:52,629
- Let's cancel.
- No.


92
0:13:52,629 --> 0:13:55,69
Asshole!


93
0:13:55,69 --> 0:14:0,948
Can't do that!


94
0:14:0,948 --> 0:14:12,625
Jesus Christ, get off of me!
You can give Americans a bad rep!


95
0:14:12,625 --> 0:14:15,106
They'd just as soon kill you
as look at you, kid.


96
0:14:15,106 --> 0:14:18,266
That's my brother!


97
0:14:18,266 --> 0:14:20,664
- Just tryin' to help you.
- Take us to a hospital!


98
0:14:20,664 --> 0:14:44,181
There's two more fights!


99
0:14:44,181 --> 0:14:47,939
Hey, where're you going?


100
0:14:47,939 --> 0:14:50,301
Where's the goddamn hospital?


101
0:14:50,301 --> 0:14:58,59
You hear me?


102
0:14:58,59 --> 0:15:1,97
Don't move.


103
0:15:1,97 --> 0:15:4,777
Taxi!


104
0:15:4,777 --> 0:15:20,734
Hospital.
I want to go to hospital.


105
0:15:20,734 --> 0:15:24,55
Asshole wouldíve probably
taken you to a whorehouse.


106
0:15:24,55 --> 0:15:29,413
He looks bad.
Let's move it.


107
0:15:29,413 --> 0:15:42,611
It's cool.
I'll take him to a good hospital.


108
0:15:42,611 --> 0:15:46,73
All right, out. Go on.
We'll party later. Out!


109
0:15:46,73 --> 0:15:48,729
Bitches never get
enough of my stuff.


110
0:15:48,729 --> 0:15:51,33
My name's Taylor,
Army special Forces.


111
0:15:51,33 --> 0:15:52,69
Retired, sort of.


112
0:15:52,69 --> 0:16:15,846
Hang on, my man. You're riding
the fastest wheels in Bangkok.


113
0:16:15,846 --> 0:16:20,165
- Can I see him now?
- The doctor say stop by tomorrow.


114
0:16:20,165 --> 0:16:23,244
- Tomorrow?
- Yes. We're doing all we can.


115
0:16:23,244 --> 0:16:27,324
It's going to be a long night.
You may as well get some sleep.


116
0:16:27,324 --> 0:16:29,243
Sleep? I can't sleep!


117
0:16:29,243 --> 0:16:57,318
Please try.
It's better for you.


118
0:16:57,318 --> 0:17:0,717
I'm sorry.
There's nothing more I can do.


119
0:17:0,717 --> 0:17:6,717
Your brother is paralyzed.


120
0:17:6,717 --> 0:17:10,277
- What do you mean, paralyzed?
- The spinal chord was damaged...


121
0:17:10,277 --> 0:17:12,996
around the tenth vertebrae.


122
0:17:12,996 --> 0:17:19,315
I'm afraid he can never walk again.


123
0:17:19,315 --> 0:17:22,914
You're going to make him
walk again.


124
0:17:22,914 --> 0:17:24,394
Easy, easy!


125
0:17:24,394 --> 0:17:33,113
Okay! Take it easy!


126
0:17:33,113 --> 0:17:34,912
It's fortunate...


127
0:17:34,912 --> 0:17:38,113
even to survive.


128
0:17:38,113 --> 0:17:42,99
He'll be in the hospital for at least
three months before he can be moved.


129
0:17:42,99 --> 0:18:9,786
I'm very sorry.


130
0:18:9,786 --> 0:18:13,906
I want--


131
0:18:13,906 --> 0:18:16,546
I want to bowl!


132
0:18:16,546 --> 0:18:24,65
Forget about it.
I'm not signing your death warrant too!


133
0:18:24,65 --> 0:18:28,24
- Just tell me where he is.
- Goddamn it, no!


134
0:18:28,24 --> 0:18:31,863
I don't want to be fuckin' part of it!
Go home!


135
0:18:31,863 --> 0:18:36,141
Wait your three months
and go home where you're safe!


136
0:18:36,141 --> 0:18:41,382
I don't want your blood on my hands.
I got enough all ready.


137
0:18:41,382 --> 0:18:48,62
He's going to pay for this.
You hear me?


138
0:18:48,62 --> 0:18:51,62
I'll find him.
I don't need your help.


139
0:18:51,62 --> 0:18:56,539
The only way you'll find him is inside
the ring, and you're not good enough!


140
0:18:56,539 --> 0:19:0,698
- I don't know where-- I'll get him.
- You don't understand.


141
0:19:0,698 --> 0:19:4,57
You go after him outside the ring
and we're dead-- all of us!


142
0:19:4,57 --> 0:19:6,337
He's too valuable to them!


143
0:19:6,337 --> 0:19:9,737
The only way is inside the ring.


144
0:19:9,737 --> 0:19:15,896
And like I said,
you ain't good enough!


145
0:19:15,896 --> 0:19:42,531
Weíll see. Okay?


146
0:19:42,531 --> 0:19:47,69
Excuse me, sir.
We have to go.


147
0:19:47,69 --> 0:21:39,712
Please, sir.


148
0:21:39,712 --> 0:21:41,752
- Hello.
- I help you?


149
0:21:41,752 --> 0:21:43,751
Yes, I want to try muay thai.


150
0:21:43,751 --> 0:21:46,831
- Oh, really?
- Yes.


151
0:21:46,831 --> 0:21:49,87
I want him. I want Tong Po.
I want to fight him.


152
0:21:49,87 --> 0:22:27,704
- You?
- Yes.


153
0:22:27,704 --> 0:22:31,623
- What do you want?
- You're serious about this muay thai.


154
0:22:31,623 --> 0:22:34,543
- What do you think?
- I think you're out of your mind.


155
0:22:34,543 --> 0:22:38,183
If I can't stop you, I might know
somebody who'll train you.


156
0:22:38,183 --> 0:22:41,982
- Someone?
- Maybe.


157
0:22:41,982 --> 0:22:44,501
- Who?
- There's one person crazy enough...


158
0:22:44,501 --> 0:22:47,781
to put you in the ring
with Tong Po.


159
0:22:47,781 --> 0:22:49,221
Name's Xian.


160
0:22:49,221 --> 0:22:52,461
- Lives out in the sticks.
- Will he do it?


161
0:22:52,461 --> 0:22:56,42
I don't have any fuckin' idea.
That's your problem.


162
0:22:56,42 --> 0:23:0,179
- I just know how to find him.
- Let's go.


163
0:23:0,179 --> 0:23:2,818
- What if he doesn't take you?
- He will. Let's go.


164
0:23:2,818 --> 0:23:6,179
- Now.
- Now? Fuck now. I'm goin' drinkin'.


165
0:23:6,179 --> 0:23:9,657
- I don't want to drink.
- You want me to take you tomorrow...


166
0:23:9,657 --> 0:23:15,777
we go drinkin' tonight,
and it's a deal.


167
0:23:15,777 --> 0:23:17,416
Deal.


168
0:23:17,416 --> 0:23:23,655
So, what's it gonna be? The Pink Pussy
or the Kitten Candy Club?


169
0:23:23,655 --> 0:23:25,974
I don't suppose we can just
go back to the hotel.


170
0:23:25,974 --> 0:23:27,414
Fuck no!


171
0:23:27,414 --> 0:23:41,53
Relax. I know a nice,
mellow place close by.


172
0:23:41,53 --> 0:23:43,171
Baby, do it!


173
0:23:43,171 --> 0:23:46,211
Hurt me!


174
0:23:46,211 --> 0:23:49,73
- Come on.
- This is your idea of a mellow place?


175
0:23:49,73 --> 0:23:58,609
Oh, yeah.
I don't go to raunchy cubs any more.


176
0:23:58,609 --> 0:24:8,568
All she offers is soda pop.


177
0:24:8,568 --> 0:24:17,687
Sit. Come on.


178
0:24:17,687 --> 0:24:20,406
Bring my usual.
What do you want to drink?


179
0:24:20,406 --> 0:24:27,685
- Water.
- Bring him a Perrier. Yeah!


180
0:24:27,685 --> 0:24:30,644
I just couldnít see
no reason to go back.


181
0:24:30,644 --> 0:24:33,724
Wasn't nothin' there for me,
so I stayed.


182
0:24:33,724 --> 0:24:37,42
I'm better off here.
Less of a danger to anybody.


183
0:24:37,42 --> 0:24:39,43
Why? What do you do?


184
0:24:39,43 --> 0:24:42,522
Guns, grenades, mines,
armoured cars, tanks.


185
0:24:42,522 --> 0:24:45,602
Whatever I can get my hands on.
Don't worry, you're safe with me.


186
0:24:45,602 --> 0:24:47,921
I'm a survivor.


187
0:24:47,921 --> 0:24:50,2
A high-livin', slick-talkin',
fast-walkin'...


188
0:24:50,2 --> 0:24:53,521
cool-drinkin' dude.


189
0:24:53,521 --> 0:24:58,72
I just like to enjoy
life's many good pleasures.


190
0:24:58,72 --> 0:25:3,319
Let me tell you about Tong Po's boss,
Freddy Li.


191
0:25:3,319 --> 0:25:5,478
That's one bad motherfucker.


192
0:25:5,478 --> 0:25:10,39
It's a different culture.
Different world.


193
0:25:10,39 --> 0:25:16,997
You gotta come to terms with that
or you won't last a heartbeat.


194
0:25:16,997 --> 0:25:21,36
Why are you helping me?


195
0:25:21,36 --> 0:25:26,915
Had a buddy in 'Nam--
like an older brother.


196
0:25:26,915 --> 0:25:29,355
Taught me everything.


197
0:25:29,355 --> 0:25:33,835
How to survive
and come out alive.


198
0:25:33,835 --> 0:25:37,393
He needed me once...


199
0:25:37,393 --> 0:25:40,74
and I wasn't there.


200
0:25:40,74 --> 0:25:43,33
Couldíve saved him...


201
0:25:43,33 --> 0:25:50,63
and I froze.


202
0:25:50,63 --> 0:26:2,391
Anyway, I saw a kid wanting
to help his brother. Here we are.


203
0:26:2,391 --> 0:26:43,942
Thanks.


204
0:26:43,942 --> 0:26:50,182
Here we are, my man.
Shangri-La meets Alice In Wonderland.


205
0:26:50,182 --> 0:26:53,541
- What is this?
- This is Xian Land.


206
0:26:53,541 --> 0:26:57,78
I'm telling you, man, he's weirder
than a three-headed cat. Good luck.


207
0:26:57,78 --> 0:27:1,138
- You're leaving?
- Yeah, I got some business up the road.


208
0:27:1,138 --> 0:27:4,139
- You're welcome to come along.
- No, I'll take my chances here.


209
0:27:4,139 --> 0:27:6,59
I'll be back in a few hours.


210
0:27:6,59 --> 0:27:18,697
By the way,
don't you provoke him, you hear?


211
0:27:18,697 --> 0:27:31,135
Don't provoke him?


212
0:27:31,135 --> 0:27:34,894
- May I help you?
- Yes. Help me down.


213
0:27:34,894 --> 0:27:38,14
- No. I cannot.
- Why?


214
0:27:38,14 --> 0:27:40,333
Don't know who you are,
what you want.


215
0:27:40,333 --> 0:27:46,892
I want down. And I want you
to teach me muay thai.


216
0:27:46,892 --> 0:27:51,851
Really?
But you are American.


217
0:27:51,851 --> 0:27:54,89
- So?
- Americans have swelled heads.


218
0:27:54,89 --> 0:28:0,5
Especially when hanging
upside-down for too long.


219
0:28:0,5 --> 0:28:3,409
Very funny.
Can you cut me down, please?


220
0:28:3,409 --> 0:28:8,568
Heard about American champion last week.
Very swelled head.


221
0:28:8,568 --> 0:28:11,167
Lost badly in fight.


222
0:28:11,167 --> 0:28:21,206
That was my brother,
and now he cannot walk.


223
0:28:21,206 --> 0:28:23,487
Wait! Wait!


224
0:28:23,487 --> 0:28:36,124
Yo! Hey, wait!


225
0:28:36,124 --> 0:28:41,603
Revenge is a dangerous motive.


226
0:28:41,603 --> 0:28:46,962
It's also a powerful one.


227
0:28:46,962 --> 0:28:54,241
Don't step there.


228
0:28:54,241 --> 0:28:57,44
So why you think
l teach you muay thai?


229
0:28:57,44 --> 0:29:2,719
Taylor. He say you're the only one
who might train me.


230
0:29:2,719 --> 0:29:5,318
Winston Taylor?


231
0:29:5,318 --> 0:29:8,159
- You know him?
- Yeah.


232
0:29:8,159 --> 0:29:11,678
Funny guy. Crazy.


233
0:29:11,678 --> 0:29:16,398
He said the same stuff about you.


234
0:29:16,398 --> 0:29:18,518
- You fight before?
- Yeah.


235
0:29:18,518 --> 0:29:22,836
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.


236
0:29:22,836 --> 0:29:31,354
- Good defence?
- Yeah.


237
0:29:31,354 --> 0:29:37,395
Must train different in America.
Your defence stinks.


238
0:29:37,395 --> 0:29:41,234
Teach me.


239
0:29:41,234 --> 0:29:44,673
Don't know who you are.
Maybe next year.


240
0:29:44,673 --> 0:29:47,472
No! I must train now.


241
0:29:47,472 --> 0:30:3,35
- Why?
- My brother. Remember?


242
0:30:3,35 --> 0:30:5,949
Take this path.
Go to the village.


243
0:30:5,949 --> 0:30:10,428
- At Mylee's store, get groceries.
- Groceries?


244
0:30:10,428 --> 0:30:15,68
- Groceries. Rice, flour, honey--
- What for?


245
0:30:15,68 --> 0:30:19,507
For lunch.
Catching people in rope make me hungry.


246
0:30:19,507 --> 0:30:26,786
What about training?


247
0:30:26,786 --> 0:30:43,543
Never make decision
on empty stomach.


248
0:30:43,543 --> 0:32:20,488
Kiki.


249
0:32:20,488 --> 0:32:22,606
Is this the Mylee store?


250
0:32:22,606 --> 0:32:25,407
Yes, I'm Mylee.
May I help you?


251
0:32:25,407 --> 0:32:30,206
I was sent by Mr. Xian
to get his groceries.


252
0:32:30,206 --> 0:32:32,125
Uncle Xian sent you?


253
0:32:32,125 --> 0:32:36,644
- He's your uncle?
- Yes, but how do you know him?


254
0:32:36,644 --> 0:32:40,644
I asked him to teach me muay thai.


255
0:32:40,644 --> 0:32:42,643
And Uncle Xian's
going to teach you?


256
0:32:42,643 --> 0:32:49,163
My uncle does not
teach anyone anymore.


257
0:32:49,163 --> 0:32:55,281
Too many people come before.
Now he prefers to be alone.


258
0:32:55,281 --> 0:32:59,88
Let me get his things.


259
0:32:59,88 --> 0:33:1,799
Where are you from?


260
0:33:1,799 --> 0:33:6,0
I was born in Belgium,
but now I live in Los Angeles.


261
0:33:6,0 --> 0:33:9,719
Why you come to Thailand?


262
0:33:9,719 --> 0:33:14,759
My brother came here
to fight Tong Po.


263
0:33:14,759 --> 0:33:19,518
Got hurt.
That's why I'm here.


264
0:33:19,518 --> 0:33:22,317
You're going to fight Tong Po?


265
0:33:22,317 --> 0:33:26,157
Yes. That's why I went
to see your uncle.


266
0:33:26,157 --> 0:33:31,316
Tong Po very mean man.
Very dangerous.


267
0:33:31,316 --> 0:33:33,515
He run this province
from Freddy Li.


268
0:33:33,515 --> 0:33:38,354
- What do you mean?
- We must all pay, or there is trouble.


269
0:33:38,354 --> 0:33:40,475
Get the police.


270
0:33:40,475 --> 0:33:43,754
Freddy Li pay police
not to interfere.


271
0:33:43,754 --> 0:33:46,632
Please, you must say nothing.


272
0:33:46,632 --> 0:33:56,511
I cannot lose my store.
It is all I have.


273
0:33:56,511 --> 0:33:59,232
Please, do not interfere.


274
0:33:59,232 --> 0:34:2,71
Don't let those jerks
take your money.


275
0:34:2,71 --> 0:34:6,309
- I must pay. It is all right.
- No, it's not!


276
0:34:6,309 --> 0:34:33,186
Give back the money.


277
0:34:33,186 --> 0:34:36,585
That was very stupid!


278
0:34:36,585 --> 0:34:40,63
- What do you mean?
- I get in big trouble now!


279
0:34:40,63 --> 0:34:44,904
- But I did it, not you
- Freddy Li won't care.


280
0:34:44,904 --> 0:34:49,142
Look what you did to my store!


281
0:34:49,142 --> 0:34:53,382
What was I supposed to do?
Let them take your money?


282
0:34:53,382 --> 0:34:58,82
I'm going to talk
to Uncle Xian about this.


283
0:34:58,82 --> 0:35:18,538
You don't understand.


284
0:35:18,538 --> 0:35:22,777
- Did you get my things?
- Yeah. I got everything.


285
0:35:22,777 --> 0:35:25,456
- Good.
- Hey, my man.


286
0:35:25,456 --> 0:35:28,777
What's happening?
You stayin', comin' or what?


287
0:35:28,777 --> 0:35:35,255
You will stay a while.
We have many things to discuss.


288
0:35:35,255 --> 0:35:37,815
Taylor.


289
0:35:37,815 --> 0:35:41,254
I mean, who wants
to stay here anyway?


290
0:35:41,254 --> 0:35:44,695
I'll be back in a few days
to pick you up to see Eric.


291
0:35:44,695 --> 0:35:46,215
And, uh--


292
0:35:46,215 --> 0:35:50,372
You're gonna live to regret this.
Mark my words.


293
0:35:50,372 --> 0:35:53,653
- Not a chance.
- Come inside.


294
0:35:53,653 --> 0:36:6,69
Bye.


295
0:36:6,69 --> 0:37:18,758
Change clothes.


296
0:37:18,758 --> 0:37:23,638
Breathe. Store here.


297
0:37:23,638 --> 0:37:32,956
Breathe out when hit.


298
0:37:32,956 --> 0:37:36,235
Breathe in.


299
0:37:36,235 --> 0:37:40,195
Protect.


300
0:37:40,195 --> 0:37:44,554
If you can do both at same time...


301
0:37:44,554 --> 0:38:16,748
that's good.


302
0:38:16,748 --> 0:38:24,748
- Ready to protect?
- Uh-huh.


303
0:38:24,748 --> 0:38:29,307
Guess not.


304
0:38:29,307 --> 0:38:38,184
Kurt.


305
0:38:38,184 --> 0:38:40,424
This will make run faster.


306
0:38:40,424 --> 0:38:51,23
This? How?


307
0:38:51,23 --> 0:38:54,742
- He did that?
- Yes. Can you believe it?


308
0:38:54,742 --> 0:38:57,222
Good for him.


309
0:38:57,222 --> 0:38:59,822
Good?


310
0:38:59,822 --> 0:39:2,66
My store was a mess.


311
0:39:2,66 --> 0:39:6,54
I worked four days cleaning it up.


312
0:39:6,54 --> 0:39:10,38
But Freddy Li's goons
are also a mess.


313
0:39:10,38 --> 0:39:13,859
Something I want to do for you
a long time ago.


314
0:39:13,859 --> 0:39:17,259
But if I do,
l put you in danger.


315
0:39:17,259 --> 0:39:21,379
American can get away it,
so it's good.


316
0:39:21,379 --> 0:39:27,897
Yes, but what if he doesn't
get away with it?


317
0:39:27,897 --> 0:39:50,252
- I worry for him.
- He will learn my way.


318
0:39:50,252 --> 0:40:0,51
- You're late for dinner.
- I was supposed to get--


319
0:40:0,51 --> 0:40:4,292
Look, I'm sorry
if I caused you any trouble.


320
0:40:4,292 --> 0:40:7,89
It's okay.
Do you like the food?


321
0:40:7,89 --> 0:40:10,61
- Excellent.
- My niece has many talent.


322
0:40:10,61 --> 0:40:13,729
Good to help training too.
Youíll see.


323
0:40:13,729 --> 0:40:18,768
I'm sure.
I can't wait.


324
0:40:18,768 --> 0:40:24,887
Eat your food.


325
0:40:24,887 --> 0:40:30,247
Our parents divorced when Eric and I
were both in grade school.


326
0:40:30,247 --> 0:40:35,86
Mom raised me in Europe,
and Dad raised Eric in America.


327
0:40:35,86 --> 0:40:37,646
In some ways, we're different...


328
0:40:37,646 --> 0:40:41,4
but we're brothers.


329
0:40:41,4 --> 0:40:44,44
And now it's all
the family we've got.


330
0:40:44,44 --> 0:40:46,684
You are very fortunate.


331
0:40:46,684 --> 0:40:50,883
At least the both of you
had the love of one parent.


332
0:40:50,883 --> 0:40:53,684
I never knew mine.


333
0:40:53,684 --> 0:40:58,882
My entire family was taken
when I was just an infant.


334
0:40:58,882 --> 0:41:2,761
But fate has also provided me
with Uncle Xian...


335
0:41:2,761 --> 0:41:6,76
so I am happy.


336
0:41:6,76 --> 0:41:10,24
Uncle Xian.
He is very different.


337
0:41:10,24 --> 0:41:14,96
Yes. And very wise.


338
0:41:14,96 --> 0:41:22,639
If you stay with him,
he will make you the best you can be.


339
0:41:22,639 --> 0:41:25,997
And you're going to help?


340
0:41:25,997 --> 0:41:29,357
I used to help my uncle.


341
0:41:29,357 --> 0:41:35,916
I'm going to need
all the help I can get.


342
0:41:35,916 --> 0:41:45,595
- Must you fight him?
- I have to.


343
0:41:45,595 --> 0:42:1,312
You're so beautiful.


344
0:42:1,312 --> 0:42:18,748
I have to go now.


345
0:42:18,748 --> 0:42:20,908
What is this?


346
0:42:20,908 --> 0:42:26,628
This is Stone City,
where many ancient warriors come.


347
0:42:26,628 --> 0:42:31,668
While you train here, listen.


348
0:42:31,668 --> 0:42:33,987
Listen to what?


349
0:42:33,987 --> 0:42:35,946
Just listen...


350
0:42:35,946 --> 0:42:41,825
with your mind, your heart,
your whole being.


351
0:42:41,825 --> 0:42:46,424
You must learn to be faster
than any punch or kick.


352
0:42:46,424 --> 0:43:9,1
That way, won't get hit.


353
0:43:9,1 --> 0:45:0,402
No kick. Move legs.
Okay? Okay!


354
0:45:0,402 --> 0:45:54,33
Is that enough?


355
0:45:54,33 --> 0:47:41,56
Winner, palm tree.


356
0:47:41,56 --> 0:47:52,14
Kick the tree.


357
0:47:52,14 --> 0:47:54,893
That's it.


358
0:47:54,893 --> 0:47:58,694
Take your bag and leave my house.


359
0:47:58,694 --> 0:48:0,53
What?


360
0:48:0,53 --> 0:48:3,371
- What's going on?
- You don't want training.


361
0:48:3,371 --> 0:48:11,53
Hey, you want me
to break my leg?


362
0:48:11,53 --> 0:48:19,609
Your brother. Remember?


363
0:48:19,609 --> 0:48:21,729
You want this?


364
0:48:21,729 --> 0:50:27,148
What about this? Huh?


365
0:50:27,148 --> 0:50:28,868
Ready to protect?


366
0:50:28,868 --> 0:50:38,547
Yeah!


367
0:50:38,547 --> 0:50:58,344
I am okay.


368
0:50:58,344 --> 0:51:2,384
No step there.


369
0:51:2,384 --> 0:51:4,342
Good timing.


370
0:51:4,342 --> 0:51:15,62
I go make lunch,
then maybe we take a walk?


371
0:51:15,62 --> 0:51:17,18
What did he say?


372
0:51:17,18 --> 0:51:20,38
He said your training
not finished today.


373
0:51:20,38 --> 0:52:8,132
- After lunch you go to special place.
- Special place?


374
0:52:8,132 --> 0:52:10,492
What am I supposed to learn here?


375
0:52:10,492 --> 0:52:26,89
Learn later. First, relax.


376
0:52:26,89 --> 0:52:39,687
Hot.


377
0:52:39,687 --> 0:52:42,407
It's good stuff.
What is this?


378
0:52:42,407 --> 0:52:46,685
Translated, "kiss of death."
You like?


379
0:52:46,685 --> 0:52:50,166
Oh, yeah. It's good stuff, man.


380
0:52:50,166 --> 0:52:53,5
- You good dancer?
- Dancing?


381
0:52:53,5 --> 0:52:55,844
Yeah, American dancing. Disco.


382
0:52:55,844 --> 0:52:58,764
Oh, yeah, dancing.
I'm good. Why?


383
0:52:58,764 --> 0:53:7,243
Like to see you dance,
observe your balance.


384
0:53:7,243 --> 0:53:24,479
Here? Really?


385
0:53:24,479 --> 0:53:42,956
It's all right


386
0:53:42,956 --> 0:53:44,437
Feeling


387
0:53:44,437 --> 0:53:46,916
So good today


388
0:53:46,916 --> 0:53:48,356
Ain't nobody


389
0:53:48,356 --> 0:53:50,635
Standing in my way


390
0:53:50,635 --> 0:53:51,996
Tomorrow


391
0:53:51,996 --> 0:53:59,113
There's gonna be a price to pay


392
0:53:59,113 --> 0:54:2,474
There's a mountain
that I have to climb


393
0:54:2,474 --> 0:54:6,592
It's so high
and I'm so behind


394
0:54:6,592 --> 0:54:8,672
Got to get on up


395
0:54:8,672 --> 0:54:10,513
Move on out


396
0:54:10,513 --> 0:54:30,309
Ain't no place for having doubt


397
0:54:30,309 --> 0:54:34,268
There's a river that I have to cross


398
0:54:34,268 --> 0:54:36,228
On the side


399
0:54:36,228 --> 0:54:40,347
And getting close
l won't bend


400
0:54:40,347 --> 0:54:42,26
I won't break


401
0:54:42,26 --> 0:54:43,745
Right now


402
0:54:43,745 --> 0:55:14,621
I want to celebrate


403
0:55:14,621 --> 0:55:34,697
Yeah. Yes!


404
0:55:34,697 --> 0:55:37,858
Brother lose very badly to Tong Po.


405
0:55:37,858 --> 0:55:40,137
But this brother different.


406
0:55:40,137 --> 0:55:43,256
You see how he embarrassed
your young fighters inside?


407
0:55:43,256 --> 0:55:45,976
Why not set up fight
with your good fighters?


408
0:55:45,976 --> 0:55:56,95
You will not be disappointed.


409
0:55:56,95 --> 0:55:59,934
What happened?
Why those guys try to hurt me?


410
0:55:59,934 --> 0:56:1,853
- Did they succeed?
- No.


411
0:56:1,853 --> 0:56:3,333
Good.


412
0:56:3,333 --> 0:56:7,492
Why did you leave?
And why they were so pissed at me?


413
0:56:7,492 --> 0:56:10,772
Because I tell them you say
they no good fighters...


414
0:56:10,772 --> 0:56:13,452
and that their mother
have sex with mules.


415
0:56:13,452 --> 0:56:15,51
You what?


416
0:56:15,51 --> 0:56:17,731
Oh, make them very angry,
fight hard.


417
0:56:17,731 --> 0:56:21,691
Good training.


418
0:56:21,691 --> 0:56:31,61
And now, you drive me in Pedi cab.


419
0:56:31,61 --> 0:56:37,448
Go.


420
0:56:37,448 --> 0:56:42,686
He looks pretty mean to me.


421
0:56:42,686 --> 0:56:44,406
And tough.


422
0:56:44,406 --> 0:56:47,286
Thanks, Taylor. What about Xian?


423
0:56:47,286 --> 0:56:51,885
What does he have to tell me?


424
0:56:51,885 --> 0:56:54,124
Roughly translated...


425
0:56:54,124 --> 0:57:49,915
"Kick the motherfucker's ass."


426
0:57:49,915 --> 0:58:35,189
Yes!


427
0:58:35,189 --> 0:58:38,508
What are they saying?


428
0:58:38,508 --> 0:58:47,26
"White warrior."


429
0:58:47,26 --> 0:58:51,105
I want Tong Po!


430
0:58:51,105 --> 0:59:29,58
Give me Tong Po!


431
0:59:29,58 --> 0:59:33,458
Hey, Eric!
They let you out early?


432
0:59:33,458 --> 0:59:38,898
I told them they'd be sorry
if they didn't; I'd raise hell.


433
0:59:38,898 --> 0:59:41,817
Congratulations.
Heard about your fight last night.


434
0:59:41,817 --> 0:59:43,577
I wish you were there.


435
0:59:43,577 --> 0:59:46,937
They called me nack suk cao--
"the white warrior."


436
0:59:46,937 --> 0:59:48,216
- Really?
- Yeah.


437
0:59:48,216 --> 0:59:51,56
Let's talk more about that later.
Right now I'm starved.


438
0:59:51,56 --> 0:59:52,856
You got any breakfast out here?


439
0:59:52,856 --> 0:59:56,175
Are you kidding? The best.
I go make some right now.


440
0:59:56,175 --> 0:59:58,255
Wait! I'll help.
I ain't cooked in ages.


441
0:59:58,255 --> 1:0:2,855
I'll make my specialty:
Jungle Survivor Quiche.


442
1:0:2,855 --> 1:0:5,134
What do you need for that quiche?


443
1:0:5,134 --> 1:0:6,734
It's cobra heads.


444
1:0:6,734 --> 1:0:8,414
Morning, Xian.


445
1:0:8,414 --> 1:0:43,607
See you inside.


446
1:0:43,607 --> 1:0:48,87
Good morning, Eric.


447
1:0:48,87 --> 1:0:51,605
- Is Kurt around?
- He's training on his own.


448
1:0:51,605 --> 1:3:29,9
Be back late.


449
1:3:29,9 --> 1:3:36,499
So, Kiki, what do you think?
I am ready or what?


450
1:3:36,499 --> 1:3:39,618
Yes. Thanks. Thanks a lot.


451
1:3:39,618 --> 1:3:41,898
- Huh?
- Let's talk.


452
1:3:41,898 --> 1:3:45,218
One day that dog
is going to believe in me.


453
1:3:45,218 --> 1:3:48,137
What's up?


454
1:3:48,137 --> 1:3:51,976
- I don't want you to fight him.
- What?


455
1:3:51,976 --> 1:3:56,17
I don't want you to fight Tong Po.
You know what I'm saying.


456
1:3:56,17 --> 1:3:59,14
He put you
in that wheelchair for life.


457
1:3:59,14 --> 1:4:2,254
That's right. And I don't want
you in one alongside me.


458
1:4:2,254 --> 1:4:6,254
Give it up.
Let's go home.


459
1:4:6,254 --> 1:4:9,653
I shouldíve listened to you.


460
1:4:9,653 --> 1:4:13,253
Now it's your turn
to listen to me.


461
1:4:13,253 --> 1:4:16,213
Look at me.
I can beat him.


462
1:4:16,213 --> 1:4:19,533
- That's what I thought.
- I trained muay thai with the old man.


463
1:4:19,533 --> 1:4:20,972
It's different.


464
1:4:20,972 --> 1:4:23,491
Tong Po is a killer!


465
1:4:23,491 --> 1:4:28,691
Wake up! He's not going to let you
out of that ring alive.


466
1:4:28,691 --> 1:4:33,73
Eric, I'm in the best shape
of my life.


467
1:4:33,73 --> 1:4:37,329
I'm a better fighter
than I ever was before...


468
1:4:37,329 --> 1:4:41,289
than you ever were.


469
1:4:41,289 --> 1:4:43,168
I can beat Tong Po.


470
1:4:43,168 --> 1:4:49,807
I'll win that fight
for you and me.


471
1:4:49,807 --> 1:4:52,286
Come, quick!


472
1:4:52,286 --> 1:5:1,45
Let's go.


473
1:5:1,45 --> 1:5:2,884
What's going on?


474
1:5:2,884 --> 1:5:4,925
Message from Freddy Li.


475
1:5:4,925 --> 1:5:7,45
Why is he dressed like that?


476
1:5:7,45 --> 1:5:9,763
He is wearing the traditional robes
of a messenger...


477
1:5:9,763 --> 1:5:14,523
sent to bring news of a fight,
the ancient way.


478
1:5:14,523 --> 1:5:30,841
Ancient way?


479
1:5:30,841 --> 1:5:34,359
It says you will fight the old ways--


480
1:5:34,359 --> 1:5:38,238
Hands wrapped in hemp and resin...


481
1:5:38,238 --> 1:5:40,39
dipped in broken glass.


482
1:5:40,39 --> 1:6:0,795
Bullshit!


483
1:6:0,795 --> 1:6:3,154
I have to go.


484
1:6:3,154 --> 1:6:6,635
Wait a goddamn minute! You're not
fighting that asshole like that!


485
1:6:6,635 --> 1:6:8,994
Kurt, listen to me!


486
1:6:8,994 --> 1:6:12,673
I'll kick your ass
all over the place.


487
1:6:12,673 --> 1:6:14,554
Listen to me!


488
1:6:14,554 --> 1:6:31,47
Damn.


489
1:6:31,47 --> 1:6:33,31
This is Stone City...


490
1:6:33,31 --> 1:6:37,669
where many ancient warriors come.


491
1:6:37,669 --> 1:7:11,343
While you train here, listen.


492
1:7:11,343 --> 1:7:14,102
Tao Liu, master warlord...


493
1:7:14,102 --> 1:7:17,263
I come with a good news
and request.


494
1:7:17,263 --> 1:7:18,542
Speak.


495
1:7:18,542 --> 1:7:20,622
I have arranged a fight...


496
1:7:20,622 --> 1:7:27,462
between Tong Po
and American challenger.


497
1:7:27,462 --> 1:7:31,98
He has been trained by Xian Chou.


498
1:7:31,98 --> 1:7:35,99
- Xian Chou?
- The American will not win.


499
1:7:35,99 --> 1:7:38,819
I promise you they will fight...


500
1:7:38,819 --> 1:7:40,259
the ancient way...


501
1:7:40,259 --> 1:7:44,378
in the old underground tomb.


502
1:7:44,378 --> 1:7:47,98
What is your request?


503
1:7:47,98 --> 1:7:49,617
I want to borrow one million dollars...


504
1:7:49,617 --> 1:7:54,857
to bet on Tong Po.


505
1:7:54,857 --> 1:7:59,774
I trust you will not fail me.


506
1:7:59,774 --> 1:9:14,803
It's all being arranged.


507
1:9:14,803 --> 1:10:45,69
Tong Po.


508
1:10:45,69 --> 1:11:8,25
Get him, Kiki!


509
1:11:8,25 --> 1:11:37,899
Eric, we got to get going.
I got held up on some business--


510
1:11:37,899 --> 1:11:40,58
What the hell happened?


511
1:11:40,58 --> 1:11:41,339
Freddy Li.


512
1:11:41,339 --> 1:11:43,379
- You were here?
- No.


513
1:11:43,379 --> 1:11:46,778
You think I wouldíve let them
take him if I was?


514
1:11:46,778 --> 1:11:51,618
You've done it before.


515
1:11:51,618 --> 1:11:53,657
Taylor, Kiki's still alive.


516
1:11:53,657 --> 1:11:57,216
Take us to town, to the doctor.


517
1:11:57,216 --> 1:12:1,736
Please.


518
1:12:1,736 --> 1:12:4,534
I'll get the van.


519
1:12:4,534 --> 1:12:12,853
They want to make sure
you not win.


520
1:12:12,853 --> 1:12:14,414
You can find him.


521
1:12:14,414 --> 1:12:17,534
Youíll do whatever they tell you to do,
or they'll kill both of you.


522
1:12:17,534 --> 1:12:21,494
Come on. Listen.
Help me.


523
1:12:21,494 --> 1:12:27,612
I ain't crossing Freddy Li.


524
1:12:27,612 --> 1:12:29,451
Okay, go!


525
1:12:29,451 --> 1:12:31,531
Be a chickenshit all your life.


526
1:12:31,531 --> 1:12:33,53
Like I said before...


527
1:12:33,53 --> 1:12:50,487
I don't need your help.


528
1:12:50,487 --> 1:12:53,448
- You must help Kurt.
- I'm out of it.


529
1:12:53,448 --> 1:13:0,566
Listen to me.


530
1:13:0,566 --> 1:13:5,806
Tong Po raped me...


531
1:13:5,806 --> 1:13:8,126
but I did not tell Kurt.


532
1:13:8,126 --> 1:13:11,724
His mind must be clear
for the fight.


533
1:13:11,724 --> 1:13:14,764
So, you see...


534
1:13:14,764 --> 1:15:30,341
you must help him find Eric.


535
1:15:30,341 --> 1:15:33,23
Xian...


536
1:15:33,23 --> 1:16:38,131
where is he?


537
1:16:38,131 --> 1:16:39,89
You want brother alive?


538
1:16:39,89 --> 1:16:43,291
My br--


539
1:16:43,291 --> 1:16:45,85
Make crowd happy.


540
1:16:45,85 --> 1:16:48,368
Let Tong Po punish you...


541
1:16:48,368 --> 1:16:51,248
all the rounds.


542
1:16:51,248 --> 1:16:54,47
You must last to the end...


543
1:16:54,47 --> 1:16:56,367
or brother die...


544
1:16:56,367 --> 1:16:58,127
very slowly.


545
1:16:58,127 --> 1:17:8,486
You understand, huh?


546
1:17:8,486 --> 1:21:48,28
Let's go.


547
1:21:48,28 --> 1:22:28,113
Go on, kill him!


548
1:22:28,113 --> 1:22:30,232
I was waiting for you, Winston.


549
1:22:30,232 --> 1:22:33,392
- Why so late?
- Sorry it took so long.


550
1:22:33,392 --> 1:22:50,63
Traffic was a mess.
There's a big fight in town.


551
1:22:50,63 --> 1:22:53,69
Thanks. Now we're even.


552
1:22:53,69 --> 1:24:22,895
Now Kiki even too.


553
1:24:22,895 --> 1:24:26,173
You bleed like Mylee.


554
1:24:26,173 --> 1:24:45,73
Mylee good fuck.


555
1:24:45,73 --> 1:24:47,85
Tell me.


556
1:24:47,85 --> 1:24:50,891
Tell me the truth.


557
1:24:50,891 --> 1:25:2,327
Tell me!


558
1:25:2,327 --> 1:25:44,12
I love you.


559
1:25:44,12 --> 1:25:52,96
Get him, Kurt!


560
1:25:52,96 --> 1:25:55,479
Mylee, cut these ropes.


561
1:25:55,479 --> 1:26:6,316
- What?
- Just cut them.


562
