1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:3,597
Knebworth, baby girl!
Stop the car.


2
0:0:3,597 --> 0:0:6,316
I hurt myself.


3
0:0:6,316 --> 0:0:6,956
Hello?


4
0:0:6,956 --> 0:0:8,916
All right, fine. Bye.


5
0:0:8,916 --> 0:0:14,76
I need to go. We'll talk about this
when I get back, I promise.


6
0:0:14,76 --> 0:0:16,157
Will you stop staring at me?
It freaks me out.


7
0:0:16,157 --> 0:0:17,916
I'm not staring at you.


8
0:0:17,916 --> 0:0:20,476
You absolute scrubber.


9
0:0:20,476 --> 0:0:23,875
You apologise to her now
or I will curl you up, all right?


10
0:0:23,875 --> 0:0:25,195
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!


11
0:0:25,195 --> 0:0:27,477
How could I have got him so wrong?


12
0:0:27,477 --> 0:0:36,676
Y'all right?


13
0:0:36,676 --> 0:0:38,396
Dear diary.


14
0:0:38,396 --> 0:0:43,476
Lust has taken over. No matter
what else is going on in my life,


15
0:0:43,476 --> 0:0:47,277
there's only one thing allowed
inside my head right now.


16
0:0:47,277 --> 0:0:50,436
And his name is Finn.


17
0:0:50,436 --> 0:0:53,356
And that's because I kissed him.


18
0:0:53,356 --> 0:0:56,316
Well, technically kissed him.


19
0:0:56,316 --> 0:0:58,956
Let me explain.


20
0:0:58,956 --> 0:1:2,76
As you know, I kissed Archie.


21
0:1:2,76 --> 0:1:6,596
This is before I knew he was gay,
so it still counts.


22
0:1:6,596 --> 0:1:9,676
Archie kissed a girl...


23
0:1:9,676 --> 0:1:12,756
reluctantly, called Tracey Croft.


24
0:1:12,756 --> 0:1:18,116
Tracey Croft shared a bit of her
kebab, and tongue, with Chop.


25
0:1:18,116 --> 0:1:20,636
Bleurgh!


26
0:1:20,636 --> 0:1:25,156
Chop unknowingly kissed Izzy
up near Rutland Waters.


27
0:1:25,156 --> 0:1:28,235
Whoever that was, can't kiss.
It's like kissing a bloody corpse.


28
0:1:28,235 --> 0:1:33,596
Izzy swapped lips minutes later
with a girl called Julia Fisher.


29
0:1:33,596 --> 0:1:36,556
That's how you kiss someone.
Oo-ooh!


30
0:1:36,556 --> 0:1:42,36
And finally, Julia Fisher kissed...


31
0:1:42,36 --> 0:1:46,356
my Finn.


32
0:1:46,356 --> 0:1:50,756
So there,
technically we've sort of kissed.


33
0:1:50,756 --> 0:1:51,876
Simple.


34
0:1:51,876 --> 0:1:54,556
Maybe you're in love.
I'm not in love!


35
0:1:54,556 --> 0:1:57,635
How many men do I fancy per week?
Well, this sounds different.


36
0:1:57,635 --> 0:2:0,77
It's not different
and I'm not in love.


37
0:2:0,77 --> 0:2:1,636
I don't even know him.


38
0:2:1,636 --> 0:2:4,715
I used to think he was shallow,
and maybe he is.


39
0:2:4,715 --> 0:2:8,876
Maybe I'm just confused because
I want him to tickle my kidneys.


40
0:2:8,876 --> 0:2:10,436
What's he like?


41
0:2:10,436 --> 0:2:13,595
Well, he's got this shy, but would-be
nuclear-in-bed thing going on.


42
0:2:13,595 --> 0:2:14,797
He really likes music and...


43
0:2:14,797 --> 0:2:18,876
Oh, bollocks! Hide!


44
0:2:18,876 --> 0:2:25,236
What the hell is he doing here?


45
0:2:25,236 --> 0:2:28,316
I thought you said he was shallow.


46
0:2:28,316 --> 0:2:31,716
I think I might be about
to commit a sex crime.


47
0:2:31,716 --> 0:2:35,156
I think I might be your accomplice.


48
0:2:35,156 --> 0:2:36,596
Bollocks!


49
0:2:36,596 --> 0:2:39,307
I'm in love, aren't I?


50
0:2:39,307 --> 0:3:17,516
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>


51
0:3:17,516 --> 0:3:19,836
Rae, it's Chloe... again.


52
0:3:19,836 --> 0:3:21,956
Look, we should meet up.


53
0:3:21,956 --> 0:3:37,276
We've got loads to chat about,
so please call me back.


54
0:3:37,276 --> 0:3:39,996
That's it.


55
0:3:39,996 --> 0:3:41,916
What the hell is going on?


56
0:3:41,916 --> 0:3:44,757
We've installed a chin-up bar
in your doorway.


57
0:3:44,757 --> 0:3:46,236
Why?


58
0:3:46,236 --> 0:3:49,37
Karim says it's the strongest
doorway in the house.


59
0:3:49,37 --> 0:3:51,516
You can't do that.


60
0:3:51,516 --> 0:3:53,635
Rae, he can't leave the house,
remember.


61
0:3:53,635 --> 0:3:57,676
He's got to stay in shape
if he wants to keep me interested.


62
0:3:57,676 --> 0:3:59,715
There's no point arguing with you,
is there?


63
0:3:59,715 --> 0:4:3,235
No, not really, not unless
you want to pay the mortgage.


64
0:4:3,235 --> 0:4:7,756
Dear diary, it's been over a decade
since a man's lived in this house


65
0:4:7,756 --> 0:4:11,876
and now I have a six-foot tall
Tunisian sweating in my doorway.


66
0:4:11,876 --> 0:4:14,717
I give it two weeks
before Mum scares him off.


67
0:4:14,717 --> 0:4:20,476
This came for you.


68
0:4:20,476 --> 0:4:22,76
Just look at my dad.


69
0:4:22,76 --> 0:4:25,157
My mum is so annoying
that when they split up,


70
0:4:25,157 --> 0:4:27,396
he moved to the Outer Hebrides.


71
0:4:27,396 --> 0:4:30,675
He's sent a couple of postcards
a year since I was six.


72
0:4:30,675 --> 0:4:32,877
He never leaves a return address.


73
0:4:32,877 --> 0:4:36,396
He says he doesn't want
to stand on my mum's toes.


74
0:4:36,396 --> 0:4:37,716
Dear Rae...


75
0:4:37,716 --> 0:4:40,477
I always imagine him
to have a Scottish accent.


76
0:4:40,477 --> 0:4:42,516
I'm not sure why.


77
0:4:42,516 --> 0:4:44,596
I think he was born in Derby.


78
0:4:44,596 --> 0:4:48,557
Just wanted to drop you a card
to say that I'm thinking of you.


79
0:4:48,557 --> 0:4:52,516
Stay out of trouble.
Lots of love, Victor.


80
0:4:52,516 --> 0:4:53,636
Dad.


81
0:4:53,636 --> 0:4:57,236
He always finishes
with a piece of life advice.


82
0:4:57,236 --> 0:5:1,556
PS, he who is dishonest
only ever lies to himself.


83
0:5:1,556 --> 0:5:6,556
The truthful path is the only one
that leads to happiness.


84
0:5:6,556 --> 0:5:13,436
Rae.


85
0:5:13,436 --> 0:5:15,996
What does that look mean?


86
0:5:15,996 --> 0:5:17,555
You mean you don't know.


87
0:5:17,555 --> 0:5:20,997
I thought you knew what was going on
in my head at every moment.


88
0:5:20,997 --> 0:5:26,196
Well, maybe I do
and I want you to tell me.


89
0:5:26,196 --> 0:5:29,196
I'm just...


90
0:5:29,196 --> 0:5:31,356
tired of being a phoney.


91
0:5:31,356 --> 0:5:33,557
I feel like I've been carrying around


92
0:5:33,557 --> 0:5:37,316
this big backpack of bullshit
for months.


93
0:5:37,316 --> 0:5:42,36
It's exhausting, you know?


94
0:5:42,36 --> 0:5:45,37
When I told Chloe I'd been ill,
I felt nervous.


95
0:5:45,37 --> 0:5:48,836
And then angry
because she walked out.


96
0:5:48,836 --> 0:5:51,796
But afterwards...


97
0:5:51,796 --> 0:5:55,597
I felt like I'd put down
the big bag of bullshit for a while.


98
0:5:55,597 --> 0:6:0,596
Relief. Right, relief.


99
0:6:0,596 --> 0:6:2,516
I want to be like...


100
0:6:2,516 --> 0:6:4,356
a new Rae.


101
0:6:4,356 --> 0:6:7,116
No more backpack. Exactly.


102
0:6:7,116 --> 0:6:9,637
And I want us
to be able to talk about anything.


103
0:6:9,637 --> 0:6:12,916
Be really honest with each other.
I mean...


104
0:6:12,916 --> 0:6:14,876
why not?


105
0:6:14,876 --> 0:6:18,157
I'm loving the new Rae.
So what do you want to talk about?


106
0:6:18,157 --> 0:6:20,236
First of all...


107
0:6:20,236 --> 0:6:22,796
I think I'm in love.


108
0:6:22,796 --> 0:6:25,237
Oh, oh. What happened?
I don't know.


109
0:6:25,237 --> 0:6:27,516
I feel... sick.


110
0:6:27,516 --> 0:6:28,915
I feel like I'm floating,


111
0:6:28,915 --> 0:6:32,755
like a warm breeze could just blow me
off the face of the earth.


112
0:6:32,755 --> 0:6:34,837
Oh, yes, sounds like love to me.
So?


113
0:6:34,837 --> 0:6:36,556
What do I do?


114
0:6:36,556 --> 0:6:44,716
Well, what would the new Rae do?


115
0:6:44,716 --> 0:6:49,516
New Rae needed a manifesto
of honesty.


116
0:6:49,516 --> 0:6:52,237
Tell Finn I kind of, sort of,
love him.


117
0:6:52,237 --> 0:6:54,796
Tell Chloe everything that happened.


118
0:6:54,796 --> 0:7:4,156
Tell everyone I was ill.


119
0:7:4,156 --> 0:7:5,356
This is crazy.


120
0:7:5,356 --> 0:7:7,836
He's like looking at porn.


121
0:7:7,836 --> 0:7:10,956
As if he's ever going to like me.


122
0:7:10,956 --> 0:7:16,316
Rae!


123
0:7:16,316 --> 0:7:17,677
What are you doing here?


124
0:7:17,677 --> 0:7:19,796
I just came for a walk.


125
0:7:19,796 --> 0:7:22,157
Just keeping it real,
keeping it busy.


126
0:7:22,157 --> 0:7:25,636
Real busy.


127
0:7:25,636 --> 0:7:29,36
So how was Knebworth, then?


128
0:7:29,36 --> 0:7:30,756
Crap. Liar.


129
0:7:30,756 --> 0:7:36,836
I were gutted you couldn't come.


130
0:7:36,836 --> 0:7:39,35
Finn...
I wanted to tell you something.


131
0:7:39,35 --> 0:7:40,795
I wanted to talk to you too,
actually.


132
0:7:40,795 --> 0:7:44,77
Look, I'm sorry I was a bit
of a dick when we first met.


133
0:7:44,77 --> 0:7:45,596
I just...


134
0:7:45,596 --> 0:7:47,117
I got you wrong, I guess.


135
0:7:47,117 --> 0:7:49,196
I didn't know you were sound.


136
0:7:49,196 --> 0:7:50,636
Finn!


137
0:7:50,636 --> 0:8:6,516
Anyway, look, I'd better go.


138
0:8:6,516 --> 0:8:9,636
Oh... my... Lord!


139
0:8:9,636 --> 0:8:14,396
I'm never using this hand again
for anything.


140
0:8:14,396 --> 0:8:15,756
Well...


141
0:8:15,756 --> 0:8:39,636
maybe for one thing.


142
0:8:39,636 --> 0:8:42,116
Rae, thank God, look, don't panic.


143
0:8:42,116 --> 0:8:43,235
Nobody is panicking,


144
0:8:43,235 --> 0:8:45,757
but me and Karim, we've got to
leave the country.


145
0:8:45,757 --> 0:8:46,836
What?


146
0:8:46,836 --> 0:8:49,37
We think someone's tipped off
Immigration.


147
0:8:49,37 --> 0:8:50,396
Who?


148
0:8:50,396 --> 0:8:52,516
Fucking Sally Crowther's mum.


149
0:8:52,516 --> 0:8:55,475
Tess, who works behind the Lottery
counter at Food Giant, right,


150
0:8:55,475 --> 0:8:58,395
says she's been asking questions
about the exotic man who lives here.


151
0:8:58,395 --> 0:9:1,877
What exactly do you mean,
you're leaving the country?


152
0:9:1,877 --> 0:9:3,276
I'm buggering off.


153
0:9:3,276 --> 0:9:5,556
Outside of England, to Tunisia.


154
0:9:5,556 --> 0:9:7,516
This is crazy.


155
0:9:7,516 --> 0:9:9,675
No, it's all right,
it's only for three nights.


156
0:9:9,675 --> 0:9:11,675
It's not like we're going on
holiday.


157
0:9:11,675 --> 0:9:13,117
Oh, Karim, make sure you
bring the camera.


158
0:9:13,117 --> 0:9:14,516
Camera.


159
0:9:14,516 --> 0:9:16,876
Right.


160
0:9:16,876 --> 0:9:18,275
I'm really not happy
about leaving you.


161
0:9:18,275 --> 0:9:19,637
Are you sure you're
going to be right?


162
0:9:19,637 --> 0:9:21,516
I'll be fine.


163
0:9:21,516 --> 0:9:24,517
Maybe I shouldn't go. Cos last time
you were on your own...


164
0:9:24,517 --> 0:9:31,396
It's not like last time.
I'm much better than I was.


165
0:9:31,396 --> 0:9:32,917
Mum, you're scaring me.


166
0:9:32,917 --> 0:9:34,596
Taxi man. Taxi man.


167
0:9:34,596 --> 0:9:36,77
Right... out of the way.


168
0:9:36,77 --> 0:9:38,196
No parties.


169
0:9:38,196 --> 0:9:40,635
I've asked Mrs Dewhurst to keep an
eye on you


170
0:9:40,635 --> 0:9:42,235
and I'm going to ring Kester


171
0:9:42,235 --> 0:9:46,195
to make sure he can bring forward
your second appointment. No parties.


172
0:9:46,195 --> 0:9:48,595
I've left a list of things
by the kettle.


173
0:9:48,595 --> 0:9:51,277
Go to the hospital
if you don't feel well.


174
0:9:51,277 --> 0:9:56,676
Bye, love.


175
0:9:56,676 --> 0:10:4,236
No parties.


176
0:10:4,236 --> 0:10:7,475
What should you do when the bane of
your existence


177
0:10:7,475 --> 0:10:22,676
finally pisses off for a bit?


178
0:10:22,676 --> 0:10:51,392
Hmm... maybe I'll just start with
a movie and some ice-cream.


179
0:10:51,392 --> 0:10:52,673
How long's she away for?


180
0:10:52,673 --> 0:10:57,431
She's back on Thursday.


181
0:10:57,431 --> 0:10:58,471
What's that?


182
0:10:58,471 --> 0:11:3,391
It's a present... to say sorry.


183
0:11:3,391 --> 0:11:10,231
I was a mess when you came round to
mine.


184
0:11:10,231 --> 0:11:15,991
Well, I was a twat. Really.


185
0:11:15,991 --> 0:11:22,191
Here.


186
0:11:22,191 --> 0:11:23,751
So...


187
0:11:23,751 --> 0:11:25,831
what happened with Stephen?


188
0:11:25,831 --> 0:11:28,512
Well, we dragged it out
for another three hours...


189
0:11:28,512 --> 0:11:30,991
is what happened.


190
0:11:30,991 --> 0:11:34,551
But I don't want to talk about that.


191
0:11:34,551 --> 0:11:36,71
So...


192
0:11:36,71 --> 0:11:37,351
So...


193
0:11:37,351 --> 0:11:40,67
I guess I never finished telling you
what happened to me.


194
0:11:40,67 --> 0:11:43,832
Well, you don't have to tell me
if you don't want to, it's fine.


195
0:11:43,832 --> 0:11:52,191
No, I want to.


196
0:11:52,191 --> 0:11:55,591
You said you hate yourself.


197
0:11:55,591 --> 0:12:6,511
I just, um...


198
0:12:6,511 --> 0:12:9,191
It was March.


199
0:12:9,191 --> 0:12:13,991
My mum was on nights.


200
0:12:13,991 --> 0:12:17,151
I'd be at school in the day,
I'd come back,


201
0:12:17,151 --> 0:12:19,43
my tea would be in the oven
with a note.


202
0:12:19,43 --> 0:12:21,71
I didn't see her for three or four
days.


203
0:12:21,71 --> 0:12:24,712
It was too quiet.
Time to think about things.


204
0:12:24,712 --> 0:12:28,951
My mind started screaming.


205
0:12:28,951 --> 0:12:31,111
Getting into weird patterns.


206
0:12:31,111 --> 0:12:33,31
Weird repetitions.


207
0:12:33,31 --> 0:12:34,951
Random bad thoughts.


208
0:12:34,951 --> 0:12:38,231
Something broke inside me.


209
0:12:38,231 --> 0:12:41,99
And the weight of one thing just
pulled everything else apart...


210
0:12:41,99 --> 0:12:51,711
everything else apart.
Pulled everything else apart.


211
0:12:51,711 --> 0:12:53,71
Rae...


212
0:12:53,71 --> 0:12:55,831
why did you do that?


213
0:12:55,831 --> 0:12:57,191
I don't know.


214
0:12:57,191 --> 0:12:59,472
Something must have made you do it.


215
0:12:59,472 --> 0:13:10,871
What were you thinking about?


216
0:13:10,871 --> 0:13:12,511
I don't know.


217
0:13:12,511 --> 0:13:17,151
I think sometimes people just go
crazy.


218
0:13:17,151 --> 0:13:18,951
But it doesn't matter.


219
0:13:18,951 --> 0:13:23,391
I'm not like that any more.


220
0:13:23,391 --> 0:13:25,791
I'm getting better.


221
0:13:25,791 --> 0:13:29,31
Are you sure?


222
0:13:29,31 --> 0:13:31,71
Yeah.


223
0:13:31,71 --> 0:13:56,191
Yeah, I am.


224
0:13:56,191 --> 0:13:58,912
I've decided I'm going to tell
everyone.


225
0:13:58,912 --> 0:14:2,831
Why?


226
0:14:2,831 --> 0:14:4,47
I just feel like a phoney.


227
0:14:4,47 --> 0:14:6,32
I'm tired of having secrets.


228
0:14:6,32 --> 0:14:8,511
Rae, everyone's got secrets.


229
0:14:8,511 --> 0:14:11,391
I need to do this.


230
0:14:11,391 --> 0:14:12,431
For me.


231
0:14:12,431 --> 0:14:24,951
OK.


232
0:14:24,951 --> 0:14:28,591
One down, two to go.


233
0:14:28,591 --> 0:14:31,231
Bollocks to a saliva tree.


234
0:14:31,231 --> 0:14:35,471
I needed to give him
some of my real saliva.


235
0:14:35,471 --> 0:14:40,111
On whichever part of his body
he wanted.


236
0:14:40,111 --> 0:14:43,431
And if being honest
might make this happen,


237
0:14:43,431 --> 0:14:54,831
it was time to truth the fuck up.


238
0:14:54,831 --> 0:14:57,471
Anyway, then he hugged me.


239
0:14:57,471 --> 0:14:59,551
Shirtless?
Oh!


240
0:14:59,551 --> 0:15:1,951
He smelt of boy sweat and CK One.


241
0:15:1,951 --> 0:15:4,23
I thought my ovaries
were going to explode.


242
0:15:4,23 --> 0:15:6,27
So, are you still going to tell him
you like him?


243
0:15:6,27 --> 0:15:8,32
You're heading towards
the friend zone.


244
0:15:8,32 --> 0:15:12,951
What? You're heading towards
the friend zone.


245
0:15:12,951 --> 0:15:14,752
What the hell are you talking about?


246
0:15:14,752 --> 0:15:18,951
So this is basically the zone
where Finn's friends live.


247
0:15:18,951 --> 0:15:24,631
And this is the zone where Finn's
romantic possibilities live.


248
0:15:24,631 --> 0:15:28,471
And this...


249
0:15:28,471 --> 0:15:29,951
is you, Rae.


250
0:15:29,951 --> 0:15:32,27
Now, you're getting to know the guy
and you're gonna end up


251
0:15:32,27 --> 0:15:33,55
in one of these two areas.


252
0:15:33,55 --> 0:15:35,99
Now, tell me, which area do you want
to end up in?


253
0:15:35,99 --> 0:15:38,63
Tix? She wants to be in
the romantic zone.


254
0:15:38,63 --> 0:15:41,43
Correct, Tix, she wants to be
in the romantic zone.


255
0:15:41,43 --> 0:15:44,232
But at the moment, Rae,
you are heading over here.


256
0:15:44,232 --> 0:15:46,551
But we hugged.


257
0:15:46,551 --> 0:15:50,72
Exactly. Now, that's exactly my
point. Now, who do you ever hug, hm?


258
0:15:50,72 --> 0:15:52,711
Your gran, your mum, your mates.


259
0:15:52,711 --> 0:15:56,192
AKA, people you have
no romantic interest in whatsoever.


260
0:15:56,192 --> 0:15:58,31
So, go on then.


261
0:15:58,31 --> 0:16:1,431
How do I make it to
the romantic zone?


262
0:16:1,431 --> 0:16:5,511
Well, first off, as a general rule,
no hugging.


263
0:16:5,511 --> 0:16:9,271
OK? No... hugging.


264
0:16:9,271 --> 0:16:12,32
Then all you have to do
is act like you don't like him.


265
0:16:12,32 --> 0:16:14,871
Treat him mean to keep him keen.


266
0:16:14,871 --> 0:16:18,991
What, am I 11 years old or something?
It'll create tension,


267
0:16:18,991 --> 0:16:22,671
and tension... tension is the key


268
0:16:22,671 --> 0:16:24,471
to getting here.


269
0:16:24,471 --> 0:16:26,67
Why can't I just be honest with him?


270
0:16:26,67 --> 0:16:28,27
Look, take it or leave it.


271
0:16:28,27 --> 0:16:31,512
Danny knows what he's talking about.
Thanks, Dix.


272
0:16:31,512 --> 0:16:36,551
See me after class for some
extra-curricular shenanigans.


273
0:16:36,551 --> 0:16:46,431
Tix, do you fancy him?


274
0:16:46,431 --> 0:16:47,631
Chloe?


275
0:16:47,631 --> 0:16:50,83
Have you ever heard of the friend
zone? Heard of it?


276
0:16:50,83 --> 0:16:52,75
You're looking at it right now.


277
0:16:52,75 --> 0:16:57,271
Do you think they like each other?
Izzy definitely likes Chop.


278
0:16:57,271 --> 0:17:0,47
I reckon Chop likes Izzy,
I just don't think he knows it yet.


279
0:17:0,47 --> 0:17:2,472
Do you think they'll ever go out
with each other?


280
0:17:2,472 --> 0:17:3,711
I doubt it.


281
0:17:3,711 --> 0:17:10,991
There's no way out of the
friend zone, Rae.


282
0:17:10,991 --> 0:17:13,231
All right?


283
0:17:13,231 --> 0:17:16,671
S-Stop. What?


284
0:17:16,671 --> 0:17:23,751
I really need to talk to Archie.


285
0:17:23,751 --> 0:17:25,312
What was all that about?


286
0:17:25,312 --> 0:17:28,711
Right... so are you gonna tell me
what happened


287
0:17:28,711 --> 0:17:32,551
with that guy that you fancy?


288
0:17:32,551 --> 0:17:34,711
So... we kissed.


289
0:17:34,711 --> 0:17:36,671
Ugh, filth!


290
0:17:36,671 --> 0:17:38,231
But...


291
0:17:38,231 --> 0:17:41,911
I just...


292
0:17:41,911 --> 0:17:43,791
There was nothing.


293
0:17:43,791 --> 0:17:45,671
What do you mean?


294
0:17:45,671 --> 0:17:47,191
I'm shitting it, Rae.


295
0:17:47,191 --> 0:17:51,991
I've kissed girls and I've kissed
boys and I felt nothing.


296
0:17:51,991 --> 0:17:54,872
I'm starting to think
I've got no sexuality.


297
0:17:54,872 --> 0:17:58,391
Archie, how can you have
no sexuality?


298
0:17:58,391 --> 0:18:0,83
Especially when you're peeping
all the time.


299
0:18:0,83 --> 0:18:1,99
I did that three times.


300
0:18:1,99 --> 0:18:3,792
But you said it was...
All right!


301
0:18:3,792 --> 0:18:8,631
Less than ten times.


302
0:18:8,631 --> 0:18:12,991
I'm just a bit of a mess right now.


303
0:18:12,991 --> 0:18:16,591
Archie, come here.


304
0:18:16,591 --> 0:18:20,151
All right, love birds?
Hey, Chop.


305
0:18:20,151 --> 0:18:21,831
Where's Finn?


306
0:18:21,831 --> 0:18:24,27
He's gone off home to his mum.
His gran's not well.


307
0:18:24,27 --> 0:18:26,632
Don't say owt, but he's pretty
cut up about it.


308
0:18:26,632 --> 0:18:28,791
Here he is, the big knobhead.


309
0:18:28,791 --> 0:18:30,71
What?


310
0:18:30,71 --> 0:18:34,471
So, Raemundo, a little birdie
told me you've got an empty.


311
0:18:34,471 --> 0:18:37,152
Chop!
What? I didn't tell her who told me.


312
0:18:37,152 --> 0:18:40,991
Anyway... you know what
I'm thinking...


313
0:18:40,991 --> 0:18:42,671
No, no parties.


314
0:18:42,671 --> 0:18:46,43
I'm not talking any old party.
I'm talking a sexy party.


315
0:18:46,43 --> 0:18:50,471
What's a sexy party? It's exactly
the same as a normal party,


316
0:18:50,471 --> 0:18:51,83
but everyone brings sleeping bags


317
0:18:51,83 --> 0:18:53,63
and no-one asks any questions
in the morning.


318
0:18:53,63 --> 0:18:55,19
Oh, so it's basically like
a sleepover, yeah?


319
0:18:55,19 --> 0:18:58,712
Can I borrow a duvet, Rae,
cos I haven't got a sleeping bag.


320
0:18:58,712 --> 0:19:1,271
Oh, no, cos we're not having a party,


321
0:19:1,271 --> 0:19:4,271
sexy or otherwise.


322
0:19:4,271 --> 0:19:6,432
Oh, my God, Finn, show everyone
your love letter.


323
0:19:6,432 --> 0:19:7,831
Huh?


324
0:19:7,831 --> 0:19:9,431
Oh, who's that?


325
0:19:9,431 --> 0:19:10,832
Finn's got an admirer.


326
0:19:10,832 --> 0:19:12,191
What?


327
0:19:12,191 --> 0:19:15,431
Let's see it. Get it out.


328
0:19:15,431 --> 0:19:17,31
Pink.


329
0:19:17,31 --> 0:19:18,71
Ooh!


330
0:19:18,71 --> 0:19:20,751
"Dear Finn, you are so fit
and lovely.


331
0:19:20,751 --> 0:19:22,551
"I want to make you mine.


332
0:19:22,551 --> 0:19:25,391
"Love from... X."


333
0:19:25,391 --> 0:19:26,591
Ooh!


334
0:19:26,591 --> 0:19:31,751
Who would even send a love letter?
That is so stupid.


335
0:19:31,751 --> 0:19:33,83
It's franked from Lincolnshire,
so it must be a local girl.


336
0:19:33,83 --> 0:19:36,31
But all letters are stamped
"Lincolnshire"


337
0:19:36,31 --> 0:19:38,39
if that's where they're delivered.


338
0:19:38,39 --> 0:19:42,791
What? Letters are stamped where
they're sent from, not sent to.


339
0:19:42,791 --> 0:19:44,471
You're not serious?


340
0:19:44,471 --> 0:19:46,31
You're 16 years old


341
0:19:46,31 --> 0:19:49,432
and you think letters are stamped
where they're sent... to?


342
0:19:49,432 --> 0:19:55,911
It's what my mum said.


343
0:19:55,911 --> 0:21:29,1
I'm joking.


344
0:21:29,1 --> 0:21:34,652
Diary, maybe I wasn't the only one
with a backpack full of bullshit.


345
0:21:34,652 --> 0:21:36,559
Maybe most people had at least


346
0:21:36,559 --> 0:21:39,601
a pocket full of bullshit on them
at all times.


347
0:21:39,601 --> 0:21:43,4
But that didn't mean everyone did.


348
0:21:43,4 --> 0:21:48,72
And it didn't mean I had to.


349
0:21:48,72 --> 0:21:53,72
In some ways, I never wanted to see
my mum's face ever again.


350
0:21:53,72 --> 0:21:56,15
In some ways, I couldn't wait
for her to get back,


351
0:21:56,15 --> 0:21:59,146
so I could finally destroy her.


352
0:21:59,146 --> 0:22:0,952
Chop? "All right, Rae!"


353
0:22:0,952 --> 0:22:3,738
So how do you host a sexy party?


354
0:22:3,738 --> 0:22:14,18
"Whoo! Yes!"


355
0:22:14,18 --> 0:22:19,338
All right, Rae?


356
0:22:19,338 --> 0:22:21,738
Hey! Mwah!


357
0:22:21,738 --> 0:22:23,739
All right, Rae. Give us a hug.


358
0:22:23,739 --> 0:22:26,18
No.


359
0:22:26,18 --> 0:22:28,939
I've got a no-hugging policy.
You just hugged Archie.


360
0:22:28,939 --> 0:22:37,698
Yeah, I just implemented it
in the last few seconds.


361
0:22:37,698 --> 0:22:41,417
What are you doing? I said come round
at seven. You're three hours early.


362
0:22:41,417 --> 0:22:43,737
I just thought I'd give you
a bit of time to bed in.


363
0:22:43,737 --> 0:22:48,378
Bed in? Chop, sexy parties aren't as
big as normal parties, are they?


364
0:22:48,378 --> 0:22:50,577
No. It's very much
an intimate affair.


365
0:22:50,577 --> 0:22:56,218
Just a few guests.
Don't you worry.


366
0:22:56,218 --> 0:22:59,521
Chloe.


367
0:22:59,521 --> 0:23:0,601
What?


368
0:23:0,601 --> 0:23:3,721
- Nice one.
- What?


369
0:23:3,721 --> 0:23:6,24
I've got a bit of a problem.
Well, what's up?


370
0:23:6,24 --> 0:23:7,682
I've got therapy in an hour.


371
0:23:7,682 --> 0:23:9,761
Skip it. I can't.


372
0:23:9,761 --> 0:23:12,0
Right, so what are you going
to tell them, then?


373
0:23:12,0 --> 0:23:14,24
Oh, bollocks to it,
I'm just going to tell them all.


374
0:23:14,24 --> 0:23:16,402
Rae, I've thought about that
and I don't think you should.


375
0:23:16,402 --> 0:23:17,841
Well, why not?


376
0:23:17,841 --> 0:23:21,76
They're my friends, Chloe, they're
not going to judge me. You didn't.


377
0:23:21,76 --> 0:23:23,282
Well, they might
treat you differently.


378
0:23:23,282 --> 0:23:27,561
Besides, it is none
of their business.


379
0:23:27,561 --> 0:23:28,842
But I'm sick of lying.


380
0:23:28,842 --> 0:23:30,641
Rae, everyone lies.


381
0:23:30,641 --> 0:23:33,602
I don't believe that.
Oh, Chloe, I can't believe that.


382
0:23:33,602 --> 0:23:36,521
Rae, listen to me.


383
0:23:36,521 --> 0:23:38,321
They might not understand.


384
0:23:38,321 --> 0:23:42,179
Are you sure you want to take
that risk?


385
0:23:42,179 --> 0:23:43,539
Look, don't.


386
0:23:43,539 --> 0:23:46,19
Everyone...
Yeah, here we go.


387
0:23:46,19 --> 0:23:49,499
I've, um... got to nip out for a bit.


388
0:23:49,499 --> 0:23:52,59
So... don't trash the place.


389
0:23:52,59 --> 0:23:53,34
What? Where are you going?


390
0:23:53,34 --> 0:23:56,139
Um...
She's got to go to her uncle's.


391
0:23:56,139 --> 0:23:57,46
Get some more booze.


392
0:23:57,46 --> 0:24:0,899
Sweet. Sweet.


393
0:24:0,899 --> 0:24:2,299
Here y'are, Rae.


394
0:24:2,299 --> 0:24:5,258
I've got some tunes here
that you might not have.


395
0:24:5,258 --> 0:24:8,338
Right, just stick them
by the rest of the CDs then.


396
0:24:8,338 --> 0:24:10,319
But I don't step on your toes
music-wise.


397
0:24:10,319 --> 0:24:11,599
I know how you like to think


398
0:24:11,599 --> 0:24:14,281
you have that superior knowledge of
music and all that.


399
0:24:14,281 --> 0:24:17,72
Yeah, right. Whatever.


400
0:24:17,72 --> 0:24:22,2
I've got to go.


401
0:24:22,2 --> 0:24:26,92
Right. See you later, buddy.


402
0:24:26,92 --> 0:24:29,56
Buddy? Buddy.


403
0:24:29,56 --> 0:24:31,0
This is not good.


404
0:24:31,0 --> 0:24:33,719
You are at the very brink of the
border of the friend zone.


405
0:24:33,719 --> 0:24:36,79
You're at the checkpoint.
So what do I do?


406
0:24:36,79 --> 0:24:39,441
You need tension,
you need to do something drastic.


407
0:24:39,441 --> 0:24:44,16
You need to make him see you
in a romantic way.


408
0:24:44,16 --> 0:24:47,239
I'll come to the party. I'll
pretend to be your ex-boyfriend.


409
0:24:47,239 --> 0:24:49,841
I'll tell everybody how amazing
you were when we were going out.


410
0:24:49,841 --> 0:24:51,24
How good in bed.


411
0:24:51,24 --> 0:24:52,84
What? Why not?


412
0:24:52,84 --> 0:24:56,8
Because it's just more bullshit.


413
0:24:56,8 --> 0:24:58,759
I don't give a shit, that's why.
Please, keep your voice down.


414
0:24:58,759 --> 0:25:1,679
This is where I work.
Don't tell me to keep my voice down.


415
0:25:1,679 --> 0:25:4,439
What do you want me to say?
I don't want you to say anything.


416
0:25:4,439 --> 0:25:6,79
I tried, there's no point.


417
0:25:6,79 --> 0:25:10,16
What are we going to do about
the car? I need this for work.


418
0:25:10,16 --> 0:25:14,56
Oh, for fuck's sake!


419
0:25:14,56 --> 0:25:18,0
So how is the new Rae thing going?


420
0:25:18,0 --> 0:25:20,681
I don't think everyone's ready
for the new Rae.


421
0:25:20,681 --> 0:25:24,12
Well, they'd better start
getting ready.


422
0:25:24,12 --> 0:25:26,479
So how are you coping
with your mum being away?


423
0:25:26,479 --> 0:25:28,359
The first time you've been
on your own


424
0:25:28,359 --> 0:25:30,159
since the night you came in, right?


425
0:25:30,159 --> 0:25:31,801
Yeah, but that was only bad


426
0:25:31,801 --> 0:25:37,0
because there was no-one there
to stop me sinking.


427
0:25:37,0 --> 0:25:40,8
What started you sinking?


428
0:25:40,8 --> 0:25:44,4
I was just alone and... miserable.


429
0:25:44,4 --> 0:25:46,401
It's just random bad thoughts,
isn't it?


430
0:25:46,401 --> 0:25:48,4
No.


431
0:25:48,4 --> 0:25:49,4
Behaviour...


432
0:25:49,4 --> 0:25:51,36
it's not chaotic.


433
0:25:51,36 --> 0:25:54,76
Being on your own that night
was just a trigger.


434
0:25:54,76 --> 0:25:58,159
What we need to figure out is
why you don't like yourself.


435
0:25:58,159 --> 0:26:1,759
We need to start digging deeper,
looking at things in your past


436
0:26:1,759 --> 0:26:3,919
and seeing how you've made sense
of them,


437
0:26:3,919 --> 0:26:9,4
things you might not have thought
about for years.


438
0:26:9,4 --> 0:26:13,4
You said that being honest
made you feel better.


439
0:26:13,4 --> 0:26:15,88
Well, this is about being
really honest.


440
0:26:15,88 --> 0:26:17,88
Painfully so.


441
0:26:17,88 --> 0:26:23,96
About being honest with yourself.


442
0:26:23,96 --> 0:26:27,92
You know you can talk to me
about stuff, don't you?


443
0:26:27,92 --> 0:26:30,8
What do you mean?
I mean...


444
0:26:30,8 --> 0:26:34,4
what have you been up to
the last few days?


445
0:26:34,4 --> 0:26:37,161
Oh, not much, my life
isn't as interesting as yours.


446
0:26:37,161 --> 0:26:39,48
Has anything happened?


447
0:26:39,48 --> 0:26:41,76
No, nothing's happened.


448
0:26:41,76 --> 0:26:43,96
My life's very dull.


449
0:26:43,96 --> 0:26:48,68
So, we can talk about anything
as long as it's to do with me,


450
0:26:48,68 --> 0:26:50,441
that's just the way it is?


451
0:26:50,441 --> 0:26:54,32
I'm sorry,
have I missed something here?


452
0:26:54,32 --> 0:26:57,92
Just forget it.


453
0:26:57,92 --> 0:27:1,28
OK, let's go back
to the night you came in.


454
0:27:1,28 --> 0:27:4,601
Let's just start examining how you
were feeling,


455
0:27:4,601 --> 0:27:8,32
what you were thinking.


456
0:27:8,32 --> 0:27:9,52
I can't remember.


457
0:27:9,52 --> 0:27:11,241
You can't remember what happened?


458
0:27:11,241 --> 0:27:12,6
No.


459
0:27:12,6 --> 0:27:14,681
Well, that's quite common.
A lot of people have...


460
0:27:14,681 --> 0:27:17,16
'Why should you be honest?


461
0:27:17,16 --> 0:27:20,48
'Why should you ever tell anyone
anything?


462
0:27:20,48 --> 0:27:23,279
'Adults will tell you
that you should always be truthful,


463
0:27:23,279 --> 0:27:25,561
'but they're as full of it
as everyone else.'


464
0:27:25,561 --> 0:27:28,12
but it's all in there somewhere.


465
0:27:28,12 --> 0:27:29,28
I'm sure it is.


466
0:27:29,28 --> 0:27:56,64
Look, can we finish early,
I've got something on.


467
0:27:56,64 --> 0:27:59,36
Chop.


468
0:27:59,36 --> 0:28:3,12
Chop. Chop!


469
0:28:3,12 --> 0:28:4,2
What happened?


470
0:28:4,2 --> 0:28:5,759
Yeah, the numbers seem
to have swelled up a bit,


471
0:28:5,759 --> 0:28:7,39
but I know everyone here personally.


472
0:28:7,39 --> 0:28:10,121
I can vouch for every one of them.
Who's that, then?


473
0:28:10,121 --> 0:28:11,24
Hannah.


474
0:28:11,24 --> 0:28:12,641
All right, who's that?


475
0:28:12,641 --> 0:28:15,16
Hannah.


476
0:28:15,16 --> 0:28:17,161
All right, so I don't know everyone.


477
0:28:17,161 --> 0:28:26,12
For example,
he's definitely not from Stamford.


478
0:28:26,12 --> 0:28:28,16
Danny.
Oh, here she is.


479
0:28:28,16 --> 0:28:31,479
I've been telling everybody about
when we were going out, you know.


480
0:28:31,479 --> 0:28:33,719
Our romantic break in Staffordshire.
You did what?


481
0:28:33,719 --> 0:28:34,599
Anyway, like I said,


482
0:28:34,599 --> 0:28:36,961
even though we bought a two-day pass
for Alton Towers,


483
0:28:36,961 --> 0:28:40,28
we didn't really want to leave
the hotel room.


484
0:28:40,28 --> 0:28:42,601
I've still never been
on the Corkscrew.


485
0:28:42,601 --> 0:28:44,24
Rae, that is so wild.


486
0:28:44,24 --> 0:28:51,8
Good... good times.


487
0:28:51,8 --> 0:28:53,319
Next thing I know,
we were at reception


488
0:28:53,319 --> 0:28:55,759
and she said,
"Can you keep the noise down a bit?


489
0:28:55,759 --> 0:28:57,41
"We've had complaints
from next door."


490
0:28:57,41 --> 0:29:0,84
That's a load of bollocks, that,
isn't it?


491
0:29:0,84 --> 0:29:3,76
Isn't it?


492
0:29:3,76 --> 0:29:5,639
Why didn't you tell me you were
going out


493
0:29:5,639 --> 0:29:7,119
with someone at the hospital?


494
0:29:7,119 --> 0:29:9,239
How do you know he's
from the hospital?


495
0:29:9,239 --> 0:29:10,719
I don't know, he's a bit odd.


496
0:29:10,719 --> 0:29:12,121
I said to just turn the TV up,


497
0:29:12,121 --> 0:29:14,52
or just enjoy the park,


498
0:29:14,52 --> 0:29:20,4
like the rest of the people
who do it, know what I mean?


499
0:29:20,4 --> 0:29:22,279
Listen, Rae, please don't make
me leave.


500
0:29:22,279 --> 0:29:24,321
It's so boring back at the hospital.


501
0:29:24,321 --> 0:29:25,44
Danny...


502
0:29:25,44 --> 0:29:28,39
Listen, I've been telling everyone
what an amazing lover you are.


503
0:29:28,39 --> 0:29:29,919
You know, not too gentle
and not too strong,


504
0:29:29,919 --> 0:29:33,161
that perfect harmonious pitch
between giving and greedy.


505
0:29:33,161 --> 0:29:36,8
Right, Danny, you can stay.


506
0:29:36,8 --> 0:29:39,32
Just... just don't do anything crazy.


507
0:29:39,32 --> 0:29:41,239
But I am crazy.
I've got a certificate


508
0:29:41,239 --> 0:29:43,161
from the Government that proves it.


509
0:29:43,161 --> 0:29:47,84
Listen, do they all know
that you've been ill?


510
0:29:47,84 --> 0:29:51,44
I'm going to tell them in
my own time.


511
0:29:51,44 --> 0:29:53,68
Just promise me, yeah?


512
0:29:53,68 --> 0:30:1,92
I promise, Scout's honour.


513
0:30:1,92 --> 0:30:5,6
Archie, who has he been talking to?


514
0:30:5,6 --> 0:30:7,12
I don't know.


515
0:30:7,12 --> 0:30:12,24
But I think he might have found out
who sent him that love letter.


516
0:30:12,24 --> 0:30:15,76
Rae, mind if I use your phone
to ring home?


517
0:30:15,76 --> 0:30:17,281
There's one in my mum's room.


518
0:30:17,281 --> 0:30:22,8
I'm going to freshen up,
so I'll show you where it is.


519
0:30:22,8 --> 0:30:24,199
You're being way too subtle.


520
0:30:24,199 --> 0:30:26,199
Remember, he's a boy,
we don't do subtle.


521
0:30:26,199 --> 0:30:41,32
Ignore him, you need tension.


522
0:30:41,32 --> 0:30:45,4
Is this where the party is?


523
0:30:45,4 --> 0:30:46,719
Come on, we ain't gonna
cause any trouble.


524
0:30:46,719 --> 0:30:48,79
Everything all right here, Rae?


525
0:30:48,79 --> 0:30:49,199
Who's this mickey?


526
0:30:49,199 --> 0:30:50,481
I'm her ex-boyfriend.


527
0:30:50,481 --> 0:30:52,6
Jesus, you poor fucker!


528
0:30:52,6 --> 0:30:53,799
Is there going to be a problem here?


529
0:30:53,799 --> 0:30:55,599
Yeah, there is going to be
a problem.


530
0:30:55,599 --> 0:30:57,279
What are you going to do
about it?


531
0:30:57,279 --> 0:30:59,639
I don't know.
I'm a bit mental, you see.


532
0:30:59,639 --> 0:31:1,839
I'm a bit unpredictable.
Right, well,


533
0:31:1,839 --> 0:31:4,801
why don't you piss off inside
before I get unpredictable?


534
0:31:4,801 --> 0:31:7,0
What do you lot want?


535
0:31:7,0 --> 0:31:9,81
Nothing, I just want to have
a drink.


536
0:31:9,81 --> 0:31:10,6
You're not welcome.


537
0:31:10,6 --> 0:31:12,119
I told my brother
about Finn last week


538
0:31:12,119 --> 0:31:13,759
and he said if any of you
touch me again,


539
0:31:13,759 --> 0:31:15,81
he's gonna knock you out.


540
0:31:15,81 --> 0:31:17,48
Yeah, well, you're not coming in.


541
0:31:17,48 --> 0:31:20,81
I guess we'll just have to stand
here all night.


542
0:31:20,81 --> 0:31:23,4
Jog on, you big bunch of fannies.


543
0:31:23,4 --> 0:31:24,44
You fuckin' scumbag!


544
0:31:24,44 --> 0:31:41,24
Go on, fuck off!


545
0:31:41,24 --> 0:31:46,2
Right, right, we'll have a couple
of rounds of normal spin the bottle,


546
0:31:46,2 --> 0:31:48,0
just as a warm-up.


547
0:31:48,0 --> 0:31:55,8
Then we can spice things up a bit.


548
0:31:55,8 --> 0:31:57,201
You know he only organises
things like this


549
0:31:57,201 --> 0:32:0,44
so he can get off with someone,
don't you?


550
0:32:0,44 --> 0:32:1,52
Rae.


551
0:32:1,52 --> 0:32:3,16
Rae!


552
0:32:3,16 --> 0:32:5,8
What?


553
0:32:5,8 --> 0:32:6,519
Seriously, are you deaf?


554
0:32:6,519 --> 0:32:8,79
How? I couldn't hear you.


555
0:32:8,79 --> 0:32:9,401
Of course you could hear me.


556
0:32:9,401 --> 0:32:11,56
Right, one, two, three.


557
0:32:11,56 --> 0:32:15,6
Ohhhhh!


558
0:32:15,6 --> 0:32:18,4
The almighty Barnstaple!
Yes!


559
0:32:18,4 --> 0:32:19,36
Next one.


560
0:32:19,36 --> 0:32:24,6
Ohhhh!


561
0:32:24,6 --> 0:32:25,76
Archibald.


562
0:32:25,76 --> 0:32:28,72
I'm not even playing, mate, no.


563
0:32:28,72 --> 0:32:36,12
No.


564
0:32:36,12 --> 0:32:38,96
So... so who's this Danny guy then?


565
0:32:38,96 --> 0:32:40,36
What's it to you?


566
0:32:40,36 --> 0:32:42,439
It's nowt to me, I just wondered


567
0:32:42,439 --> 0:32:45,39
what school he went to
or if he's from around here.


568
0:32:45,39 --> 0:32:46,641
No, he's not from around here.


569
0:32:46,641 --> 0:32:47,84
Ready?


570
0:32:47,84 --> 0:32:55,72
Ohhhhhhh!


571
0:32:55,72 --> 0:32:59,4
Again. Whoa, whoa, yeah.


572
0:32:59,4 --> 0:33:0,641
Go and get me a drink. What?


573
0:33:0,641 --> 0:33:4,76
Quick, now.
Get your own drink.


574
0:33:4,76 --> 0:33:17,48
Go on, lad, get in there!


575
0:33:17,48 --> 0:33:19,519
Right, right, no messing about.


576
0:33:19,519 --> 0:33:21,79
We're upping the stakes.


577
0:33:21,79 --> 0:33:25,28
Couples have to go into the landing
cupboard together, for a minute.


578
0:33:25,28 --> 0:33:30,48
No exceptions, you cheeky little...


579
0:33:30,48 --> 0:33:34,48
Ohhhhhhh!


580
0:33:34,48 --> 0:33:36,6
Raemundo!


581
0:33:36,6 --> 0:33:38,721
She's only going in the cupboard
of lust.


582
0:33:38,721 --> 0:33:40,6
But who will it be with?


583
0:33:40,6 --> 0:33:41,96
Whoo!


584
0:33:41,96 --> 0:33:46,4
One, two, three.


585
0:33:46,4 --> 0:33:47,721
'I wished for Archie.


586
0:33:47,721 --> 0:33:50,88
'We could just go in there and
chat.


587
0:33:50,88 --> 0:33:54,8
'I wished for Chop,
just a friendly fumble.


588
0:33:54,8 --> 0:33:56,281
'I just wished for someone


589
0:33:56,281 --> 0:34:0,56
'who wouldn't be disappointed that
they had the kiss me.


590
0:34:0,56 --> 0:34:1,6
'Oh, my God!


591
0:34:1,6 --> 0:34:3,56
'What if it's Finn?


592
0:34:3,56 --> 0:34:5,44
'What if my breath smells?


593
0:34:5,44 --> 0:34:8,8
'What if I burp in his mouth?


594
0:34:8,8 --> 0:34:12,48
'It won't be Finn, it won't be Finn,
it won't be Finn.


595
0:34:12,48 --> 0:34:37,0
'Oh, shit!'


596
0:34:37,0 --> 0:34:38,28
Rae?


597
0:34:38,28 --> 0:34:39,92
Yeah.


598
0:34:39,92 --> 0:34:43,81
Why are you being
such a complete knobhead to me?


599
0:34:43,81 --> 0:34:44,2
Sorry?


600
0:34:44,2 --> 0:34:47,4
Did I do something to annoy you?


601
0:34:47,4 --> 0:34:49,36
No, I just...


602
0:34:49,36 --> 0:34:51,79
Then why are you mugging me off
all the time?


603
0:34:51,79 --> 0:34:53,359
I apologised for being a bit funny
when they first met,


604
0:34:53,359 --> 0:34:54,999
but that's because
I didn't know you.


605
0:34:54,999 --> 0:34:56,799
Now, one minute
you're dead nice to me


606
0:34:56,799 --> 0:34:59,1
and the next you're just being
totally rude.


607
0:34:59,1 --> 0:35:1,0
I'm not trying to be rude.


608
0:35:1,0 --> 0:35:4,88
Then maybe it just comes naturally
to you.


609
0:35:4,88 --> 0:35:6,841
I thought we were getting on.


610
0:35:6,841 --> 0:35:9,2
30 seconds left, love birds.


611
0:35:9,2 --> 0:35:11,41
It's not as simple as that, is it?


612
0:35:11,41 --> 0:35:13,8
It is as simple as that, Rae.


613
0:35:13,8 --> 0:35:15,519
Either we're friends
or we're not friends.


614
0:35:15,519 --> 0:35:17,201
Maybe I don't want to be your friend.


615
0:35:17,201 --> 0:35:18,88
You what?


616
0:35:18,88 --> 0:35:20,4
Maybe...


617
0:35:20,4 --> 0:35:22,76
I don't want to be your friend.


618
0:35:22,76 --> 0:35:29,4
Why not?


619
0:35:29,4 --> 0:36:0,348
Hey-hey! Right, who's next?


620
0:36:0,348 --> 0:36:3,196
I'm not being funny,
but can we stop playing this now?


621
0:36:3,196 --> 0:36:4,956
No, I haven't kissed anyone yet.


622
0:36:4,956 --> 0:36:6,956
Are you even capable of still
kissing someone?


623
0:36:6,956 --> 0:36:9,314
I don't think anyone else
is playing.


624
0:36:9,314 --> 0:36:10,313
I'm playing.


625
0:36:10,313 --> 0:36:11,952
Well, great, you two kiss
each other then.


626
0:36:11,952 --> 0:36:13,274
Everyone else can just chill out.


627
0:36:13,274 --> 0:36:15,433
What?! Izzy?


628
0:36:15,433 --> 0:36:33,833
Jesus!


629
0:36:33,833 --> 0:36:35,73
Eww!


630
0:36:35,73 --> 0:36:39,33
It's like kissing a corpse.


631
0:36:39,33 --> 0:36:52,753
Ugh! Minging!


632
0:36:52,753 --> 0:36:55,553
Chop.


633
0:36:55,553 --> 0:37:5,393
Where's Finn?


634
0:37:5,393 --> 0:37:9,433
Finn?


635
0:37:9,433 --> 0:37:14,993
Oh, shit.


636
0:37:14,993 --> 0:37:21,233
Oh, Finn, I'm so sorry.


637
0:37:21,233 --> 0:37:24,433
Sorry.


638
0:37:24,433 --> 0:38:21,793
Oh, it's all right.


639
0:38:21,793 --> 0:38:23,714
I thought you weren't having
a party.


640
0:38:23,714 --> 0:38:28,313
I wanted to piss my mum off.


641
0:38:28,313 --> 0:38:29,713
Are you all right?


642
0:38:29,713 --> 0:38:32,953
Yeah, I suppose.


643
0:38:32,953 --> 0:38:34,593
You'd have liked my nan.


644
0:38:34,593 --> 0:38:38,993
She was always talking about
something.


645
0:38:38,993 --> 0:38:40,754
What are you trying to say?


646
0:38:40,754 --> 0:38:44,353
Nothing. Just... you're always
banging on about it.


647
0:38:44,353 --> 0:38:46,593
You cheeky bas...


648
0:38:46,593 --> 0:38:47,953
No, in a good way.


649
0:38:47,953 --> 0:38:51,33
I like it.


650
0:38:51,33 --> 0:38:53,593
I like talking to you.


651
0:38:53,593 --> 0:39:1,73
And I don't like talking to anybody.


652
0:39:1,73 --> 0:39:3,793
So are we all right?


653
0:39:3,793 --> 0:40:14,474
Yeah. We're all right.


654
0:40:14,474 --> 0:40:17,193
Are you all right?


655
0:40:17,193 --> 0:40:20,153
You seem happy today.


656
0:40:20,153 --> 0:40:22,753
I'm gay, Rae.


657
0:40:22,753 --> 0:40:25,73
Are you pleased about it?


658
0:40:25,73 --> 0:40:48,673
I'm fucking delirious.


659
0:40:48,673 --> 0:40:51,193
Here it is, Churchill.


660
0:40:51,193 --> 0:40:53,73
Where's Tix?


661
0:40:53,73 --> 0:40:55,234
It was... it was something about...


662
0:40:55,234 --> 0:40:57,513
- Danny?
- Danny, it's Rae.


663
0:40:57,513 --> 0:40:58,592
I've had a great time.


664
0:40:58,592 --> 0:41:0,714
It's just nice to get out of the
hospital, isn't it?


665
0:41:0,714 --> 0:41:4,713
It was noisy, wasn't it?
It was... it was something.


666
0:41:4,713 --> 0:41:6,273
Yeah.


667
0:41:6,273 --> 0:41:9,354
It was about something, wasn't it?
It was nice.


668
0:41:9,354 --> 0:41:12,73
Loud.
Yeah. Right, come on.


669
0:41:12,73 --> 0:41:13,353
Noise.


670
0:41:13,353 --> 0:41:16,233
Music.


671
0:41:16,233 --> 0:41:33,394
All right?


672
0:41:33,394 --> 0:41:35,33
Will he be all right?


673
0:41:35,33 --> 0:41:36,713
Yeah, he's fine.


674
0:41:36,713 --> 0:41:38,434
Do you need your hat back?


675
0:41:38,434 --> 0:41:42,193
No, mate, it's yours.
You can keep it.


676
0:41:42,193 --> 0:41:46,73
All right, I'll see you later.
See you.


677
0:41:46,73 --> 0:41:47,833
Thanks.


678
0:41:47,833 --> 0:41:51,673
Bye. Bye.


679
0:41:51,673 --> 0:41:53,473
Oh, bye.


680
0:41:53,473 --> 0:41:57,633
Yeah.


681
0:41:57,633 --> 0:42:17,273
I'll give you a ring this week,
yeah? All right, cool.


682
0:42:17,273 --> 0:42:18,834
I hope he's going to be all right.


683
0:42:18,834 --> 0:42:22,273
Yeah, he'll be fine
when he gets back.


684
0:42:22,273 --> 0:42:27,33
Chloe, listen, I was thinking,
you know about me telling everyone?


685
0:42:27,33 --> 0:42:29,393
Let's just keep it between us.


686
0:42:29,393 --> 0:42:34,433
OK.


687
0:42:34,433 --> 0:42:38,953
So, what happened with you and Finn
in the cupboard last night?


688
0:42:38,953 --> 0:42:41,393
It was interesting.


689
0:42:41,393 --> 0:42:45,913
Can I tell you something?
What?


690
0:42:45,913 --> 0:42:49,73
It was me who sent the letter
to Finn.


691
0:42:49,73 --> 0:42:51,713
What? When did you do that?


692
0:42:51,713 --> 0:42:54,33
When I broke up with Stephen.


693
0:42:54,33 --> 0:42:56,593
I just... wanted to feel normal.


694
0:42:56,593 --> 0:43:0,113
You know, be involved
in something normal.


695
0:43:0,113 --> 0:43:4,33
Does that even make sense?
No.


696
0:43:4,33 --> 0:43:7,632
The more time I spent with him this
week, I don't know, I just...


697
0:43:7,632 --> 0:43:10,234
I think there's something about him.
D'you know what I mean?


698
0:43:10,234 --> 0:43:11,273
Definitely not.


699
0:43:11,273 --> 0:43:13,154
Watch this space, anyway.
No.


700
0:43:13,154 --> 0:43:15,753
What? What?


701
0:43:15,753 --> 0:43:20,873
Do you like anyone at the minute?


702
0:43:20,873 --> 0:43:22,73
No.


703
0:43:22,73 --> 0:43:29,193
No. No.


704
0:43:29,193 --> 0:43:32,234
'Maybe some bullshit is best
kept in your pocket.


705
0:43:32,234 --> 0:43:34,233
'Or your backpack.


706
0:43:34,233 --> 0:43:41,713
'Or even your Olympic-sized
swimming pool.'


707
0:43:41,713 --> 0:43:43,512
The weather here is relentless.


708
0:43:43,512 --> 0:43:48,73
They've called off the local games -
no caber tossing for this year.


709
0:43:48,73 --> 0:43:50,314
I don't know if you've heard of
a rock band called Oasis.


710
0:43:50,314 --> 0:43:53,793
Anyway, I'm rockin'
out. You'd be embarrassed.


711
0:43:53,793 --> 0:43:55,553
I hope school is OK.


712
0:43:55,553 --> 0:43:57,393
I was terrible at school.


713
0:43:57,393 --> 0:43:59,794
Don't feel bad if you get frustrated
with your exams,


714
0:43:59,794 --> 0:44:2,393
it's a really difficult time.


715
0:44:2,393 --> 0:44:5,232
But know that I love you
and care about you so much,


716
0:44:5,232 --> 0:44:7,274
even though it may not seem like it.


717
0:44:7,274 --> 0:44:9,153
Hiya, chuck!


718
0:44:9,153 --> 0:44:11,873
Hello.
We're back.


719
0:44:11,873 --> 0:44:14,193
Oh, my God!


720
0:44:14,193 --> 0:44:21,873
Right, I'm going to put a brew on.
Karim, tell her.


721
0:44:21,873 --> 0:44:25,233
Er... we are...


722
0:44:25,233 --> 0:44:26,313
Married!


723
0:44:26,313 --> 0:44:27,833
Yes, marriage.


724
0:44:27,833 --> 0:44:30,993
Married!


725
0:44:30,993 --> 0:44:34,74
Well, what do you think about it,
Rae? No more sneaking about.


726
0:44:34,74 --> 0:44:36,993
Karim can stay.
What do you think?


727
0:44:36,993 --> 0:44:54,913
I know it's a bit sudden,
but we had no choice, really.


728
0:44:54,913 --> 0:45:5,273
Is everything all right?


729
0:45:5,273 --> 0:45:12,553
What?


730
0:45:12,553 --> 0:47:12,553
Congratulations.
