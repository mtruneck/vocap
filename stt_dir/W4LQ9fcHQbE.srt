1
0:0:3,761 --> 0:0:5,0
Oh, hey,


2
0:0:5,0 --> 0:0:6,876
you mind if Kevin
hangs out with me on Thursday?


3
0:0:6,876 --> 0:0:8,116
What for?


4
0:0:8,116 --> 0:0:9,627
Well, he'd been wanting


5
0:0:9,627 --> 0:0:11,436
to get into other sports
besides soccer.


6
0:0:11,436 --> 0:0:13,345
Maybe the cool Uncle
can succeed


7
0:0:13,345 --> 0:0:15,451
where the father has failed.


8
0:0:15,451 --> 0:0:16,721
You're not his Uncle.


9
0:0:16,721 --> 0:0:18,361
That is a minor technicality.


10
0:0:18,361 --> 0:0:20,533
You're not cool.


11
0:0:20,533 --> 0:0:22,574
Okay, now you're just
being ridiculous.


12
0:0:22,574 --> 0:0:24,12
What are you guys
gonna do?


13
0:0:24,12 --> 0:0:25,48
Oh, I don't know,


14
0:0:25,48 --> 0:0:26,386
maybe shop for purses,


15
0:0:26,386 --> 0:0:28,857
go to a knitting class,
water ballet.


16
0:0:28,857 --> 0:0:29,859
What do you think?


17
0:0:29,859 --> 0:0:30,795
We're just gonna hang out,


18
0:0:30,795 --> 0:0:32,397
you know,
like guys do.


19
0:0:32,397 --> 0:0:34,534
If it's okay with him,
it's okay with me,


20
0:0:34,534 --> 0:0:36,204
as long as you stay
out of trouble.


21
0:0:36,204 --> 0:0:38,209
If you're referring
to Kevin's birthday party,


22
0:0:38,209 --> 0:0:40,213
the ad said entertainer.


23
0:0:40,213 --> 0:0:41,181
How was I supposed to know


24
0:0:41,181 --> 0:0:42,585
she was that kind
of entertainer?


25
0:0:42,585 --> 0:0:43,921
Hey, Martin.


26
0:0:43,921 --> 0:0:44,924
Morning, Suzanne.


27
0:0:44,924 --> 0:0:47,61
You're out of corn flakes.


28
0:0:47,61 --> 0:0:48,96
Hey, baby.


29
0:0:48,96 --> 0:0:51,706
Good morning.


30
0:0:51,706 --> 0:0:53,744
Mom, can I borrow
your credit card?


31
0:0:53,744 --> 0:0:55,47
What for?


32
0:0:55,47 --> 0:0:56,451
I want to buy the sweater


33
0:0:56,451 --> 0:0:58,69
that Michelle Obama's going
to wear at her next speech.


34
0:0:58,69 --> 0:1:0,428
You can only get it online.


35
0:1:0,428 --> 0:1:1,931
The first time,
I took too long.


36
0:1:1,931 --> 0:1:4,27
The second time,
I didn't even have enough money.


37
0:1:4,27 --> 0:1:6,544
This time,
I'm ready.


38
0:1:6,544 --> 0:1:8,849
But I need a credit card.


39
0:1:8,849 --> 0:1:9,918
No.


40
0:1:9,918 --> 0:1:11,587
Why not?


41
0:1:11,587 --> 0:1:14,89
Because every time I ask you
to help me with something,


42
0:1:14,89 --> 0:1:15,189
you give me attitude.


43
0:1:15,189 --> 0:1:16,855
So why should I help you
get what you want


44
0:1:16,855 --> 0:1:18,223
when you won't help me?


45
0:1:18,223 --> 0:1:20,627
These dishes have been
sitting here since last night.


46
0:1:20,627 --> 0:1:21,762
But I've been busy.


47
0:1:21,762 --> 0:1:23,532
Besides, I didn't dirty
all these dishes.


48
0:1:23,532 --> 0:1:26,168
That's exactly the attitude
I'm talking about.


49
0:1:26,168 --> 0:1:27,303
But--
but nothing.


50
0:1:27,303 --> 0:1:29,407
I can't hear you.


51
0:1:29,407 --> 0:1:32,11
My plates are screaming,
"clean me."


52
0:1:32,11 --> 0:1:33,848
No,
they're screaming,


53
0:1:33,848 --> 0:1:36,352
"let Lindsey
use the credit card."


54
0:1:36,352 --> 0:1:38,554
My plates aren't stupid.

hello.


60
0:1:57,213 --> 0:1:58,816
Hi.


61
0:1:58,816 --> 0:2:5,24
[Sighs]


62
0:2:5,24 --> 0:2:10,64
[Sighs loudly]


63
0:2:10,64 --> 0:2:12,567
[Sighs]


64
0:2:12,567 --> 0:2:16,272
What's up, Lindsey?


65
0:2:16,272 --> 0:2:17,574
I want to buy the sweater


66
0:2:17,574 --> 0:2:19,943
that Michelle Obama's wearing
at her next speech.


67
0:2:19,943 --> 0:2:22,46
Have you saved up
your money?


68
0:2:22,46 --> 0:2:23,448
Yeah.


69
0:2:23,448 --> 0:2:24,516
Where do you get it?


70
0:2:24,516 --> 0:2:25,985
At J. Crew.


71
0:2:25,985 --> 0:2:28,21
Well, why don't you just
go to the mall and get it?


72
0:2:28,21 --> 0:2:29,656
Anybody can go
to J. Crew.


73
0:2:29,656 --> 0:2:31,659
It's not like
it's rodeo drive.


74
0:2:31,659 --> 0:2:33,428
They never make it
to the store.


75
0:2:33,428 --> 0:2:36,231
Everyone buys them online,
and they sell out.


76
0:2:36,231 --> 0:2:37,733
It's easier
to get Michelle Obama


77
0:2:37,733 --> 0:2:39,902
than it is to get
a Michelle Obama sweater.


78
0:2:39,902 --> 0:2:41,37
Did you forget


79
0:2:41,37 --> 0:2:42,739
that I used to own
a sports collectible shop


80
0:2:42,739 --> 0:2:45,743
that specialized in acquiring
hard-to-find items?


81
0:2:45,743 --> 0:2:47,445
Kind of.


82
0:2:47,445 --> 0:2:49,914
I am the master
of getting hard-to-find items.


83
0:2:49,914 --> 0:2:51,917
I got Kobe Bryant's
8 Jersey,


84
0:2:51,917 --> 0:2:54,153
a Plaxico Burress
gun holster.


85
0:2:54,153 --> 0:2:56,556
I even got a pair
of Michael Phelps' floaties.


86
0:2:56,556 --> 0:2:59,25
So...


87
0:2:59,25 --> 0:3:1,128
So you're doing it
the wrong way.


88
0:3:1,128 --> 0:3:4,365
Let me show you
how a professional does it.


89
0:3:4,365 --> 0:3:6,501
Can I use your credit card?


90
0:3:6,501 --> 0:3:8,204
Yeah.
That's not a problem.


91
0:3:8,204 --> 0:3:9,672
And because you're family,


92
0:3:9,672 --> 0:3:12,208
I'll offer you my services
free of charge.


93
0:3:12,208 --> 0:3:13,643
I wasn't gonna pay you.


94
0:3:13,643 --> 0:3:16,847
That's also
why it's free of charge.


95
0:3:16,847 --> 0:3:18,115
So let me get this straight.


96
0:3:18,115 --> 0:3:19,416
A man offered you money


97
0:3:19,416 --> 0:3:22,153
to get him a signed bat
A-Rod used in a game,


98
0:3:22,153 --> 0:3:24,389
so you sent letters
to a children's foundation


99
0:3:24,389 --> 0:3:25,958
pretending to be an orphan


100
0:3:25,958 --> 0:3:28,161
whose dream was to have
a signed A-Rod bat.


101
0:3:28,161 --> 0:3:29,429
Yes.


102
0:3:29,429 --> 0:3:31,365
But now someone
from the children's foundation


103
0:3:31,365 --> 0:3:32,7
is coming here
to meet that kid,


104
0:3:32,7 --> 0:3:34,669
so you want me
to be that fake kid,


105
0:3:34,669 --> 0:3:36,37
lie to them
and my dad,


106
0:3:36,37 --> 0:3:38,172
who just thinks
we're going to hang out?


107
0:3:38,172 --> 0:3:39,507
Well, when you say it
like that,


108
0:3:39,507 --> 0:3:41,42
it sounds negative.


109
0:3:41,42 --> 0:3:42,611
Yeah, it doesn't seem right.


110
0:3:42,611 --> 0:3:43,612
That's 'cause you left out


111
0:3:43,612 --> 0:3:45,313
the good, wholesome part
of the story.


112
0:3:45,313 --> 0:3:47,649
That guy is gonna give me
500 bucks for that bat,


113
0:3:47,649 --> 0:3:49,318
and I'll give you $50.


114
0:3:49,318 --> 0:3:50,219
You're right.


115
0:3:50,219 --> 0:3:51,954
That does make it
seem better.


116
0:3:51,954 --> 0:3:53,288
It's a deal.


117
0:3:53,288 --> 0:3:55,56
All right,
sit down.


118
0:3:55,56 --> 0:3:57,58
Okay, this is everything
I could find online


119
0:3:57,58 --> 0:3:58,459
about A-Rod, okay?


120
0:3:58,459 --> 0:3:59,927
I need you
to study these stats


121
0:3:59,927 --> 0:4:1,462
in case it comes up
in conversation,


122
0:4:1,462 --> 0:4:3,998
talking rbis,
slugging percentage,


123
0:4:3,998 --> 0:4:5,199
girlfriend history,


124
0:4:5,199 --> 0:4:7,8
both celebrity
and noncelebrity, okay?


125
0:4:7,8 --> 0:4:8,701
And these are letters.


126
0:4:8,701 --> 0:4:10,69
I need you
to take a look at these,


127
0:4:10,69 --> 0:4:12,704
because, well,
you wrote them.


128
0:4:12,704 --> 0:4:14,472
What's a crack whore?


129
0:4:14,472 --> 0:4:21,778
Unfortunately,
your mom.


130
0:4:21,778 --> 0:4:23,446
Mmm.


131
0:4:23,446 --> 0:4:26,81
I smell cinnamon toast.


132
0:4:26,81 --> 0:4:28,217
No, you smell cinnamon.


133
0:4:28,217 --> 0:4:29,218
The toast is gone.


134
0:4:29,218 --> 0:4:30,652
Oh, I'm starved.


135
0:4:30,652 --> 0:4:32,521
I didn't eat dinner
last night.


136
0:4:32,521 --> 0:4:34,589
Why didn't you eat dinner?


137
0:4:34,589 --> 0:4:36,324
Because
I'm in between boyfriends,


138
0:4:36,324 --> 0:4:38,393
and I didn't have anyone
to take me out.


139
0:4:38,393 --> 0:4:41,295
So why don't you just
go to the grocery store?


140
0:4:41,295 --> 0:4:44,97
I'm not gonna be without
a boyfriend for that long.


141
0:4:44,97 --> 0:4:46,533
Besides, I spend my money
on looking good


142
0:4:46,533 --> 0:4:50,102
so other people
will buy me food.


143
0:4:50,102 --> 0:4:51,403
But for now,


144
0:4:51,403 --> 0:4:56,306
I'll have to depend
on me, myself, and I.


145
0:4:56,306 --> 0:4:59,208
I'm hungry.


146
0:4:59,208 --> 0:5:0,909
What do you have
for me to eat?


147
0:5:0,909 --> 0:5:10,182
[Sighs]


148
0:5:10,182 --> 0:5:11,249
Are you gonna watch


149
0:5:11,249 --> 0:5:13,519
Michelle Obama's speech
this afternoon?


150
0:5:13,519 --> 0:5:14,955
Yeah, of course.
Why?


151
0:5:14,955 --> 0:5:17,524
Well, Lindsey wants
whatever J. Crew sweater


152
0:5:17,524 --> 0:5:19,159
she's gonna be wearing,
and apparently,


153
0:5:19,159 --> 0:5:20,994
so does every other girl
in the country.


154
0:5:20,994 --> 0:5:21,961
Really?


155
0:5:21,961 --> 0:5:23,63
Girls care
about J. Crew sweaters?


156
0:5:23,63 --> 0:5:26,666
If Michelle Obama wore it.


157
0:5:26,666 --> 0:5:28,534
But, you know, she wanted
to use my credit card,


158
0:5:28,534 --> 0:5:29,835
but I wouldn't let Lindsey,


159
0:5:29,835 --> 0:5:31,87
because she hasn't been
helping me around the house.


160
0:5:31,87 --> 0:5:34,605
You know, if those sweaters
are that popular,


161
0:5:34,605 --> 0:5:36,64
maybe I can sell one online


162
0:5:36,64 --> 0:5:40,177
and it'll help tide me over
while I'm in between boyfriends.


163
0:5:40,177 --> 0:5:44,281
Did you know
gas is over $3 a gallon?


164
0:5:44,281 --> 0:5:45,716
Yes.


165
0:5:45,716 --> 0:5:49,86
Anyway, I think
you should help Lindsey.


166
0:5:49,86 --> 0:5:51,155
Housework will be here
every week.


167
0:5:51,155 --> 0:5:55,126
Michelle Obama sweaters are here
for a limited time only.


168
0:5:55,126 --> 0:5:57,329
Toaster waffles, huh?


169
0:5:57,329 --> 0:6:1,488
How do you make these?


170
0:6:1,488 --> 0:6:2,589
Okay.


171
0:6:2,589 --> 0:6:5,125
In what year was A-Rod
drafted by the Mariners?


172
0:6:5,125 --> 0:6:7,27
Uh, 1993?


173
0:6:7,27 --> 0:6:9,296
Correct.


174
0:6:9,296 --> 0:6:10,964
When was A-Rod born?


175
0:6:10,964 --> 0:6:15,425
July 27...1975.


176
0:6:15,425 --> 0:6:16,592
Correct.


177
0:6:16,592 --> 0:6:17,893
What's A-Rod's middle name?


178
0:6:17,893 --> 0:6:18,654
Emmanuel.


179
0:6:18,654 --> 0:6:21,524
Correct.


180
0:6:21,524 --> 0:6:22,892
I can't believe you.


181
0:6:22,892 --> 0:6:25,61
What are you
talking about?


182
0:6:25,61 --> 0:6:27,963
I was actually thinking
about giving you my credit card.


183
0:6:27,963 --> 0:6:29,898
But you just don't get it,
Lindsey.


184
0:6:29,898 --> 0:6:32,667
This basket of clothes
has been in there all day.


185
0:6:32,667 --> 0:6:33,868
You could have folded them.


186
0:6:33,868 --> 0:6:35,302
You could have
put them away.


187
0:6:35,302 --> 0:6:37,4
But no, you left them there
to remind me


188
0:6:37,4 --> 0:6:40,407
that you don't do anything
to help me around this house.


189
0:6:40,407 --> 0:6:41,508
You know what?


190
0:6:41,508 --> 0:6:43,91
Michelle Obama did not
get to be the first lady


191
0:6:43,91 --> 0:6:51,217
by being lazy.


192
0:6:51,217 --> 0:6:53,582
She didn't get there
by folding clothes either.


193
0:6:53,582 --> 0:7:0,117
Now you're definitely
not getting it.


194
0:7:0,117 --> 0:7:1,285
Bam!


195
0:7:1,285 --> 0:7:2,853
You ready to get this?


196
0:7:2,853 --> 0:7:5,255
Okay, so how does
all this stuff work?


197
0:7:5,255 --> 0:7:6,59
We got to see
Michelle Obama


198
0:7:6,59 --> 0:7:8,123
the second
she walks out onstage,


199
0:7:8,123 --> 0:7:9,423
and I mean
the first second,


200
0:7:9,423 --> 0:7:10,691
not the second second.

206
0:7:21,3 --> 0:7:22,534
When I say
all the angles,


207
0:7:22,534 --> 0:7:23,968
I mean all the angles.


208
0:7:23,968 --> 0:7:26,27

how valuable they were,

and the bidding price
is skyrocketing.


393
0:14:16,283 --> 0:14:18,451
But you don't actually
have one to sell.


394
0:14:18,451 --> 0:14:19,619
Right,
I thought I could just


395

go down to the store
and buy one,


396
0:14:20,887 --> 0:14:22,722
but those things
are impossible to find.

they're so valuable.

0:14:24,456 --> 0:14:27,58
Well, I know that now.


399
0:14:27,58 --> 0:14:29,127
I'm gonna change the channel
from <i>Sportscenter.</i>


400
0:14:29,127 --> 0:14:30,161
Is that okay?


401
0:14:30,161 --> 0:14:31,562
Yes.


402
0:14:31,562 --> 0:14:32,863
Can I say hi
to Gigi?


403
0:14:32,863 --> 0:14:33,831
Yes.


404
0:14:33,831 --> 0:14:34,999
Hi, Gigi.


405
0:14:34,999 --> 0:14:36,33
Hi.


406
0:14:36,33 --> 0:14:37,234
You know what?


407
0:14:37,234 --> 0:14:39,136
You should have let Lindsey
get that sweater.


408
0:14:39,136 --> 0:14:40,137
Why?


409
0:14:40,137 --> 0:14:41,606
Because then
you could have told her


410
0:14:41,606 --> 0:14:42,64
she couldn't have it,


411
0:14:42,64 --> 0:14:44,75
and then you could have
given it to me.


412
0:14:44,75 --> 0:14:45,977
As a matter of fact,
Lindsey did buy the sweater,


413
0:14:45,977 --> 0:14:47,812
and I did tell her
she couldn't have it.


414
0:14:47,812 --> 0:14:48,88
Great.
Can I have it?


415
0:14:48,88 --> 0:14:50,782
No.
I'm making her take it back.


416
0:14:50,782 --> 0:14:53,84
Well, how do you take
something back to the Internet?


417
0:14:53,84 --> 0:14:55,586
She's taking it back
to the mall.


418
0:14:55,586 --> 0:14:57,655
Can I watch
a cool thing about cheetahs


419
0:14:57,655 --> 0:14:59,255
on the Discovery Channel?


420
0:14:59,255 --> 0:15:2,222
Yes.


421
0:15:2,222 --> 0:15:3,455
You know what?


422
0:15:3,455 --> 0:15:5,423
You can't take that sweater
back to the mall.


423
0:15:5,423 --> 0:15:7,191
I'll buy it from you.


424
0:15:7,191 --> 0:15:8,259
With what?


425
0:15:8,259 --> 0:15:9,26
I'll give you a cut.


426
0:15:9,26 --> 0:15:10,361
How you gonna
give me a cut


427
0:15:10,361 --> 0:15:13,129
of something you don't have?


428
0:15:13,129 --> 0:15:15,332
Besides, Gigi,
it's not about the money.


429
0:15:15,332 --> 0:15:16,966
It's about the principle.


430
0:15:16,966 --> 0:15:18,68
Oh, please.


431
0:15:18,68 --> 0:15:19,603
I've said that before,
and believe me,


432
0:15:19,603 --> 0:15:20,604
it's about the money.


433
0:15:20,604 --> 0:15:21,638
How much?


434
0:15:21,638 --> 0:15:23,671
I'm not selling you
the sweater.


435
0:15:23,671 --> 0:15:25,704
Can I put my feet up
on the coffee table?


436
0:15:25,704 --> 0:15:29,84
Yes.


437
0:15:29,84 --> 0:15:31,41
I can't believe


438
0:15:31,41 --> 0:15:32,81
you're gonna sacrifice
hundreds of dollars


439
0:15:32,81 --> 0:15:34,211
just to teach
your daughter a lesson


440
0:15:34,211 --> 0:15:35,68
when you could teach her
two lessons.


441
0:15:35,68 --> 0:15:37,882
One: Do not
disobey your mother.


442
0:15:37,882 --> 0:15:39,917
Two:
Even you can earn money


443
0:15:39,917 --> 0:15:43,588
in the comfort and privacy
of your own home.


444
0:15:43,588 --> 0:15:45,357
No.


445
0:15:45,357 --> 0:15:50,628
Three: It's better to give
than to receive.


446
0:15:50,628 --> 0:15:52,196
Sometimes.


447
0:15:52,196 --> 0:15:59,563
No.


448
0:15:59,563 --> 0:16:2,65
You're lucky all you do
is bobble, Chuck.


449
0:16:2,65 --> 0:16:3,233
Oh, you know,
I'm sorry.


450
0:16:3,233 --> 0:16:4,866
I probably
shouldn't be talking to you.


451
0:16:4,866 --> 0:16:6,734
I didn't ask permission.


452
0:16:6,734 --> 0:16:7,968
[Knocking]


453
0:16:7,968 --> 0:16:9,67
Hey.


454
0:16:9,67 --> 0:16:11,5
Hey, honey.


455
0:16:11,5 --> 0:16:12,308
What are you doing?


456
0:16:12,308 --> 0:16:13,31
Breathing.


457
0:16:13,31 --> 0:16:15,677
Oh, is that okay?


458
0:16:15,677 --> 0:16:19,547
Nick, I shouldn't have
blamed you for what Lindsey did.


459
0:16:19,547 --> 0:16:21,681
I was angry,
and I'm sorry.


460
0:16:21,681 --> 0:16:22,882
Thank you.


461
0:16:22,882 --> 0:16:28,385
Come here, babe.


462
0:16:28,385 --> 0:16:30,22
Look, Lindsey saved up
for a sweater


463
0:16:30,22 --> 0:16:32,488
Michelle Obama was wearing.


464
0:16:32,488 --> 0:16:34,623
She wants to dress
like the first lady.


465
0:16:34,623 --> 0:16:36,724
I could think
of a lot worse things.


466
0:16:36,724 --> 0:16:39,393
She could be looking up
to Amy Winehouse,


467
0:16:39,393 --> 0:16:42,195
Heidi Montag,
Courtney Love,


468
0:16:42,195 --> 0:16:44,463
the Real Housewives
of Orange County,


469
0:16:44,463 --> 0:16:47,867
you know, white women.


470
0:16:47,867 --> 0:16:49,335
You're right.


471
0:16:49,335 --> 0:16:50,469
Hey, where's Kevin?


472
0:16:50,469 --> 0:16:52,137
I haven't seen him all day.


473
0:16:52,137 --> 0:16:54,773
I told him
he could hang out with Martin.


474
0:16:54,773 --> 0:16:57,41
Why would Martin want
to hang out with a ten-year-old?


475
0:16:57,41 --> 0:16:59,549
He said he wanted
to teach him guy stuff.


476
0:16:59,549 --> 0:17:1,451
Well, he could have just
stayed here with you


477
0:17:1,451 --> 0:17:3,455
and watched baseball.


478
0:17:3,455 --> 0:17:4,589
[Crowd cheering]


479
0:17:4,589 --> 0:17:5,557
Ladies and gentlemen,


480
0:17:5,557 --> 0:17:8,26
this is a truly
heartwarming story.


481
0:17:8,26 --> 0:17:10,195
A-Rod is dedicating
this at bat


482
0:17:10,195 --> 0:17:11,662
to young Kevin Martin,


483
0:17:11,662 --> 0:17:13,664
an orphan
whose drug-addicted parents


484
0:17:13,664 --> 0:17:15,599
gave him up
for an eight ball.


485
0:17:15,599 --> 0:17:17,635
Gave him up
for an eight ball?


486
0:17:17,635 --> 0:17:20,203
That is awful.


487
0:17:20,203 --> 0:17:22,72
Oh, my God!
That's Kevin!


488
0:17:22,72 --> 0:17:23,39
What?


489
0:17:23,39 --> 0:17:24,174
Poor kid.


490
0:17:24,174 --> 0:17:25,675
Kevin Martin's
cracked-out parents


491
0:17:25,675 --> 0:17:27,209
should be ashamed
of themselves.


492
0:17:27,209 --> 0:17:28,21
Crack?


493
0:17:28,21 --> 0:17:29,978
I'm not on crack!


494
0:17:29,978 --> 0:17:31,579
Kevin Martin?


495
0:17:31,579 --> 0:17:33,648
Did Martin have something
to do with this?


496
0:17:33,648 --> 0:17:35,382
And A-Rod steps up
to the plate


497
0:17:35,382 --> 0:17:37,17
and points to the bleachers.


498
0:17:37,17 --> 0:17:41,621
Oh, he's gonna hit a home run
for poor little Kevin.


499
0:17:41,621 --> 0:17:42,989
First pitch,


500
0:17:42,989 --> 0:17:44,791
and it's a swing
and a miss.


501
0:17:44,791 --> 0:17:45,791
Strike one.


502
0:17:45,791 --> 0:17:46,792
[Groans]


503
0:17:46,792 --> 0:17:47,826
You suck, A-Rod.


504
0:17:47,826 --> 0:17:48,894
Come on, man.


505
0:17:48,894 --> 0:17:50,662
A-Rod steps back
to the plate.


506
0:17:50,662 --> 0:17:52,73
Here's the windup
and the pitch,


507
0:17:52,73 --> 0:17:54,699
and it's fouled away.


508
0:17:54,699 --> 0:17:58,35
Both: What is wrong
with you, man?


509
0:17:58,35 --> 0:18:0,7
A-Rod just can't
catch a break.


510
0:18:0,7 --> 0:18:1,404
Here comes the pitch.


511
0:18:1,404 --> 0:18:2,438
And it's a bunt.


512
0:18:2,438 --> 0:18:3,873
A bunt?


513
0:18:3,873 --> 0:18:7,376
A surprise bunt
for young Kevin Martin.


514
0:18:7,376 --> 0:18:8,977
And A-Rod's thrown out
at first,


515
0:18:8,977 --> 0:18:13,18
just like young Kevin
was thrown out of life.


516
0:18:13,18 --> 0:18:25,556
You do realize
I'm gonna kill your friend.


517
0:18:25,556 --> 0:18:26,757
Hey.


518
0:18:26,757 --> 0:18:28,225
Hey.


519
0:18:28,225 --> 0:18:30,559
Thank you
for cleaning up the kitchen.


520
0:18:30,559 --> 0:18:32,793
I'm sorry
for disrespecting you


521
0:18:32,793 --> 0:18:34,394
and lying to dad.


522
0:18:34,394 --> 0:18:36,329
I just really wanted
that sweater.


523
0:18:36,329 --> 0:18:37,697
I know.


524
0:18:37,697 --> 0:18:39,131
Can we do this?


525
0:18:39,131 --> 0:18:40,466
Yeah.


526
0:18:40,466 --> 0:18:41,833
Bam!


527
0:18:41,833 --> 0:18:42,834
Really?


528
0:18:42,834 --> 0:18:44,136
Mm-hmm.


529
0:18:44,136 --> 0:18:45,337
[Gasps]


530
0:18:45,337 --> 0:18:46,972
Thank you, mom.


531
0:18:46,972 --> 0:18:48,473
You're welcome.


532
0:18:48,473 --> 0:18:51,476
[Giggles]


533
0:18:51,476 --> 0:18:53,144
She did a good job.


534
0:18:53,144 --> 0:18:55,613
Yeah, look at this.


535
0:18:55,613 --> 0:18:58,482
Oh, hey, guys.
Hey.


536
0:18:58,482 --> 0:18:59,615
Hey.
Hey.


537
0:18:59,615 --> 0:19:1,683
Kevin, did you have
a good time with Martin?


538
0:19:1,683 --> 0:19:2,784
It was cool.


539
0:19:2,784 --> 0:19:3,851
What did you do?


540
0:19:3,851 --> 0:19:5,953
We went
to the Mariners-Yankees game.


541
0:19:5,953 --> 0:19:8,321
You don't say.
Oh, yeah.


542
0:19:8,321 --> 0:19:11,69
I even got this bat signed
by one Alex Rodriguez.


543
0:19:11,69 --> 0:19:13,992
Mm.


544
0:19:13,992 --> 0:19:15,693
I'll take that.
Thank you.


545
0:19:15,693 --> 0:19:16,66
Be careful with that.


546
0:19:16,66 --> 0:19:18,28
It's worth $1,000.


547
0:19:18,28 --> 0:19:19,295
$1,000?


548
0:19:19,295 --> 0:19:21,264
I thought you said
it was worth $500.


549
0:19:21,264 --> 0:19:22,567
Yeah, I lied.


550
0:19:22,567 --> 0:19:25,603
What else
did you lie about, Martin?


551
0:19:25,603 --> 0:19:28,238
Are you the one
who told millions of people


552
0:19:28,238 --> 0:19:30,739
that my child
was a crack baby?


553
0:19:30,739 --> 0:19:34,41
I never said that Kevin
was a crack baby.


554
0:19:34,41 --> 0:19:37,179
I said his mother
was a crack whore.


555
0:19:37,179 --> 0:19:38,714
[Doorbell rings]


556
0:19:38,714 --> 0:19:39,849
You've got three seconds


557
0:19:39,849 --> 0:19:41,751
to tell her
I had nothing to do with this.


558
0:19:41,751 --> 0:19:42,986
All right, fine.
I admit it.


559
0:19:42,986 --> 0:19:44,88
It was all my doing.


560
0:19:44,88 --> 0:19:45,723
I mean, you know Nick,
Suzanne.


561
0:19:45,723 --> 0:19:47,57
Does he seem
like he could come up


562
0:19:47,57 --> 0:19:49,59
with a plan
this complicated?


563
0:19:49,59 --> 0:19:50,627
Fortunately,
no one was harmed.


564
0:19:50,627 --> 0:19:52,529
So can I get my bat,
please?


565
0:19:52,529 --> 0:19:54,698
Your bat?


566
0:19:54,698 --> 0:19:58,769
You got this using my child
under false pretenses.


567
0:19:58,769 --> 0:19:59,703
Yeah.


568
0:19:59,703 --> 0:20:2,239
That's why I said
I was sorry.


569
0:20:2,239 --> 0:20:3,774
This is my bat.


570
0:20:3,774 --> 0:20:5,75
What?


571
0:20:5,75 --> 0:20:7,51
Never trust a crack whore.


572
0:20:7,51 --> 0:20:10,79
Suzanne,
I'm in big trouble.


573
0:20:10,79 --> 0:20:11,214
What's wrong?


574
0:20:11,214 --> 0:20:12,949
I sold that
Michelle Obama sweater online,


575
0:20:12,949 --> 0:20:15,251
and now the winning bidder
is threatening to sue me.


576
0:20:15,251 --> 0:20:16,452
Here.


577
0:20:16,452 --> 0:20:18,953
Maybe A-Rod can help you.


578
0:20:18,953 --> 0:20:20,455
What am I gonna do
with this?


579
0:20:20,455 --> 0:20:22,79
Sell it to Martin
for $1,000.


580
0:20:22,79 --> 0:20:23,891
I'll give you $500.


581
0:20:23,891 --> 0:20:25,825
I still need
to make a profit on this.


582
0:20:25,825 --> 0:20:26,725
$750.


583
0:20:26,725 --> 0:20:28,459
You still get $250
out of it.


584
0:20:28,459 --> 0:20:29,725
$650,


585
0:20:29,725 --> 0:20:32,392
and I don't tell Suzanne
what you said about her ankles.


586
0:20:32,392 --> 0:20:33,525
I know my friend,


587
0:20:33,525 --> 0:20:36,16
and she didn't say anything
about my ankles.


588
0:20:36,16 --> 0:20:37,962
$850.


589
0:20:37,962 --> 0:20:39,879
Fine, deal.


590
0:20:39,879 --> 0:20:41,489
What about my $100 buck?


591
0:20:41,489 --> 0:20:43,719
$100. We agreed on $50.


592
0:20:43,719 --> 0:20:46,649
That's when you said
it was worth $500.


593
0:20:46,649 --> 0:20:48,279
You're dead to me.


594
0:20:48,279 --> 0:20:51,409
Kevin... you were in on this?


595
0:20:51,409 --> 0:20:53,9
I only did it for the money.
