1
0:0:0,6 --> 0:0:4,233
First Lady Michelle Obama:
So welcome to the White
House, the South Lawn!


2
0:0:4,233 --> 0:0:5,233
What do you think?


3
0:0:5,233 --> 0:0:5,967
Child:
I like it!


4
0:0:5,967 --> 0:0:7,266
First Lady Michelle Obama:
You like it?


5
0:0:7,266 --> 0:0:9,9
It's okay?


6
0:0:9,9 --> 0:0:10,867
It's awesome?


7
0:0:10,867 --> 0:0:11,633
It's awesome.


8
0:0:11,633 --> 0:0:13,667
Well, you -- this is a beautiful
day, because it was like a


9
0:0:13,667 --> 0:0:17,3
hundred-and-a-million degrees
here on Monday and it would have


10
0:0:17,3 --> 0:0:18,967
been miserable to be out here.


11
0:0:18,967 --> 0:0:23,2
But we got a perfect day, and
this is a very special day for


12
0:0:23,2 --> 0:0:26,233
the White House Kitchen
Garden because in addition to


13
0:0:26,233 --> 0:0:29,367
harvesting some of the lettuces,
I think we've got broccoli


14
0:0:29,367 --> 0:0:30,3
that's ready.


15
0:0:30,3 --> 0:0:31,934
What else are we going to do?


16
0:0:31,934 --> 0:0:33,233
What's ready?


17
0:0:33,233 --> 0:0:35,3
Are we going to get some
of the rhubarb that we --


18
0:0:35,3 --> 0:0:36,166
we got rhubarb.


19
0:0:36,166 --> 0:0:38,6
You see those big huge leaves?


20
0:0:38,6 --> 0:0:40,6
That's rhubarb.


21
0:0:40,6 --> 0:0:41,7
And it's huge!


22
0:0:41,7 --> 0:0:43,834
It's like an elephant's ear.


23
0:0:43,834 --> 0:0:45,9
So we're going to pick some of
that and we're going to use some


24
0:0:45,9 --> 0:0:49,9
of that food in the White House
to feed the President's family


25
0:0:49,9 --> 0:0:50,834
and our guests.


26
0:0:50,834 --> 0:0:54,433
But we're also going to give it
away to people who need good,


27
0:0:54,433 --> 0:0:57,166
healthy food who
don't have homes.


28
0:0:57,166 --> 0:0:59,33
So we're going to be
able to get a lot done.


29
0:0:59,33 --> 0:1:4,233
But we're also going to do a
Three Sisters planting today


30
0:1:4,233 --> 0:1:8,934
because last week we launched
a special new part of our


31
0:1:8,934 --> 0:1:9,934
"Let's Move" initiative.


32
0:1:9,934 --> 0:1:11,7
Do you guys know all
about "Let's Move,"


33
0:1:11,7 --> 0:1:13,734
what we're trying to do?


34
0:1:13,734 --> 0:1:15,767
Have you heard about it?


35
0:1:15,767 --> 0:1:18,667
We're going to try to make
sure that all you kids grow up


36
0:1:18,667 --> 0:1:21,767
healthy, knowing what to eat,
knowing how to exercise.


37
0:1:21,767 --> 0:1:25,967
It's a whole initiative to work
with people all across the


38
0:1:25,967 --> 0:1:29,633
country to think about how we
eat and how we move our bodies


39
0:1:29,633 --> 0:1:33,767
so that you guys grow up healthy
and strong and able to do well


40
0:1:33,767 --> 0:1:35,767
in school and be
successful in life.


41
0:1:35,767 --> 0:1:38,5
That's what the whole "Let's
Move" effort is about.


42
0:1:38,5 --> 0:1:43,9
But last week we launched a new
component of the program called


43
0:1:43,9 --> 0:1:46,166
Let's Move Indian Country.


44
0:1:46,166 --> 0:1:50,2
And we're working specifically
with young kids in the Native


45
0:1:50,2 --> 0:1:53,3
American community all
across the country.


46
0:1:53,3 --> 0:1:58,433
And this planting is a
special way to highlight that


47
0:1:58,433 --> 0:2:0,133
new initiative.


48
0:2:0,133 --> 0:2:2,6
And this is the first time ever
that we're going to do a Three


49
0:2:2,6 --> 0:2:5,533
Sisters planting here in the
White House Kitchen Garden.


50
0:2:5,533 --> 0:2:8,0
And you all are going to be a
part of making that happen.


51
0:2:8,0 --> 0:2:10,5
Is that -- does that sound okay?


52
0:2:10,5 --> 0:2:12,1
Yeah, yeah, sounds fun?


53
0:2:12,1 --> 0:2:13,7
So we're not going
to talk too long.


54
0:2:13,7 --> 0:2:17,467
I'm going to turn it over to our
special guest, Jefferson Keel,


55
0:2:17,467 --> 0:2:20,66
and he's going to tell us a
little bit about the Three


56
0:2:20,66 --> 0:2:24,533
Sisters planting, and he's
going to do a blessing, okay?


57
0:2:24,533 --> 0:2:28,133
So let's listen up, and then
we'll get to work, okay?


58
0:2:28,133 --> 0:2:28,9
All right, here we go.


59
0:2:28,9 --> 0:2:30,834
I'm going to turn it over.


60
0:2:30,834 --> 0:2:32,367
Jefferson keel:
Thank you, ma'am.


61
0:2:32,367 --> 0:2:33,3
Thank you.


62
0:2:33,3 --> 0:2:38,6
The idea for the three
sisters as we call it,


63
0:2:38,6 --> 0:2:40,2
they are interconnected.


64
0:2:40,2 --> 0:2:45,133
The three sisters are
beans, squashes, and corn.


65
0:2:45,133 --> 0:2:49,0
And they work together to
protect each other and to help


66
0:2:49,0 --> 0:2:50,333
each other grow.


67
0:2:50,333 --> 0:2:54,867
The beans provide protection
or nutrients for the corn,


68
0:2:54,867 --> 0:2:58,2
the corn converts
nitrogen for the beans,


69
0:2:58,2 --> 0:3:4,8
and the squash has large leaves
to protect the beans from animals.


70
0:3:4,8 --> 0:3:8,834
And, of course, the Secret
Service here will protect 
these I am sure.


71
0:3:8,834 --> 0:3:13,4
But they work together
to nurture each other,


72
0:3:13,4 --> 0:3:19,9
to help us to reap those and
then help us as we consume those.


73
0:3:19,9 --> 0:3:24,233
So that is what we call -- that
is why we call them the three sisters.


74
0:3:24,233 --> 0:3:26,3
So today we are
going to plant those.


75
0:3:26,3 --> 0:3:33,7
But before that, we always
prepare ourselves and we go


76
0:3:33,7 --> 0:3:36,7
prior to planting,
we go to the creator.


77
0:3:36,7 --> 0:3:38,767
We ask God to bless those.


78
0:3:38,767 --> 0:3:41,433
So I am going to
do a brief prayer.


79
0:3:41,433 --> 0:3:44,4
And I am going to ask for a
special blessing on three things.


80
0:3:44,4 --> 0:3:47,166
One, I am going to ask for a
special blessing on all things


81
0:3:47,166 --> 0:3:49,0
God has created.


82
0:3:49,0 --> 0:3:52,66
Ask a special blessing on the
First Lady and her efforts to


83
0:3:52,66 --> 0:3:57,66
help us to move Native America.


84
0:3:57,66 --> 0:4:0,633
And then for the healing of
Mother Earth and the seeds that


85
0:4:0,633 --> 0:4:3,7
were planted so that that they
can continue to nurture us.


86
0:4:3,7 --> 0:4:5,567
So will you pray with me?


87
0:4:5,567 --> 0:4:6,867
Okay.


88
0:4:6,867 --> 0:4:17,266
(speaking foreign
language)


89
0:4:17,266 --> 0:4:21,1
Father, we thank you for this 
beautiful day that you have given us.


90
0:4:21,1 --> 0:4:25,7
We ask a special blessing on
the First Lady and her family.


91
0:4:25,7 --> 0:4:28,867
We ask that you would just keep
your hand on them and guide them


92
0:4:28,867 --> 0:4:30,567
and protect them Lord.


93
0:4:30,567 --> 0:4:34,33
We ask a special blessing on
the seeds that we planted here today.


94
0:4:34,33 --> 0:4:38,734
The corn, (foreign lanuage)
the beans, (foreign language),


95
0:4:38,734 --> 0:4:42,66
and the squash,
(foreign language).


96
0:4:42,66 --> 0:4:45,734
We ask that you would just heal
Mother Earth so that she can


97
0:4:45,734 --> 0:4:47,934
continue to nurture us.


98
0:4:47,934 --> 0:4:51,1
And, Father, I want to ask a
special blessing on the young


99
0:4:51,1 --> 0:4:54,266
men and women around the world
who are protecting our freedoms


100
0:4:54,266 --> 0:4:58,567
that we might enjoy today and
the freedoms that we enjoy in America.


101
0:4:58,567 --> 0:5:1,467
Father, we ask all of these
things in the precious and holy


102
0:5:1,467 --> 0:5:3,6
name of Jesus, amen.


103
0:5:3,6 --> 0:5:5,734
All:
Amen.


104
0:5:5,734 --> 0:5:7,433
First lady Michelle Obama:
Amen.


105
0:5:7,433 --> 0:5:7,9
All right.


106
0:5:7,9 --> 0:5:8,367
Let's go plant.


107
0:5:8,367 --> 0:5:9,834
You guys ready?


108
0:5:9,834 --> 0:5:19,7
Let's go.


109
0:5:19,7 --> 0:5:22,6
Sam Kass:
We will harvest this lettuce and
then we are going to


110
0:5:22,6 --> 0:5:24,166
pull that rhubarb.


111
0:5:24,166 --> 0:5:30,367
First lady Michelle Obama:
Oh, I love pulling rhubarb.


112
0:5:30,367 --> 0:5:45,4
Sam Kass:
My two water people are over 
here with me.


113
0:5:45,4 --> 0:5:49,5
You and I are going
to stand right here.


114
0:5:49,5 --> 0:5:51,433
This one is going to have --


115
0:5:51,433 --> 0:5:52,767
(cross talk)


116
0:5:52,767 --> 0:5:54,6
First lady Michelle Obama:
 Okay.


117
0:5:54,6 --> 0:5:57,467
When I cut --


118
0:5:57,467 --> 0:5:58,5
Sam Kass:
All right, guys.


119
0:5:58,5 --> 0:5:59,633
Come over here.


120
0:5:59,633 --> 0:6:15,8
There you go.


121
0:6:15,8 --> 0:6:17,3
First lady Michelle Obama:
Okay.


122
0:6:17,3 --> 0:6:18,266
We have to take all of these.


123
0:6:18,266 --> 0:6:22,133
Sam Kass:
It is so cold.


124
0:6:22,133 --> 0:6:22,934
I need your help now.


125
0:6:22,934 --> 0:7:23,4
Ready.


126
0:7:23,4 --> 0:7:24,9
First lady Michelle Obama:
All right.


127
0:7:24,9 --> 0:7:26,166
We need more baskets.


128
0:7:26,166 --> 0:7:30,1
Sam, we need more baskets.


129
0:7:30,1 --> 0:7:33,8
We are moving.


130
0:7:33,8 --> 0:7:37,166
You want to try?


131
0:7:37,166 --> 0:7:40,633
Sam Kass:
All right.


132
0:7:40,633 --> 0:7:46,266
Here you go.


133
0:7:46,266 --> 0:7:47,567
Is it getting cold?


134
0:7:47,567 --> 0:7:50,367
You can pull out all of those
plants just like those.


135
0:7:50,367 --> 0:7:56,133
All right.


136
0:7:56,133 --> 0:7:56,867
You can put it down here.


137
0:7:56,867 --> 0:7:57,767
You don't need a basket.


138
0:7:57,767 --> 0:7:59,367
You can put it down.


139
0:7:59,367 --> 0:8:0,2
Dig it out.


140
0:8:0,2 --> 0:8:5,133
Dig it out.


141
0:8:5,133 --> 0:8:6,66
Child:
I am ready.


142
0:8:6,66 --> 0:8:7,333
I got another half.


143
0:8:7,333 --> 0:8:14,66
I got another half.


144
0:8:14,66 --> 0:8:17,467
I got you one.


145
0:8:17,467 --> 0:8:24,667
I would like to do that one.


146
0:8:24,667 --> 0:8:27,834
Sam Kass:
Put it in there.


147
0:8:27,834 --> 0:8:29,133
Child:
Hi Mommy.


148
0:8:29,133 --> 0:8:34,233
Sam Kass:
It is so cold.


149
0:8:34,233 --> 0:8:36,9
Right in there.


150
0:8:36,9 --> 0:8:40,467
How are we doing, guys?


151
0:8:40,467 --> 0:9:1,33
Good job, guys.


152
0:9:1,33 --> 0:9:3,767
You don't have to put
those in the water.


153
0:9:3,767 --> 0:9:4,9
Child:
Where do I put them?


154
0:9:4,9 --> 0:9:6,767
Sam Kass:
I don't think
they go in the ice.


155
0:9:6,767 --> 0:9:10,3
Sam Kass:
I don't know about the ice.


156
0:9:10,3 --> 0:9:12,233
Sam Kass:
Look at those.


157
0:9:12,233 --> 0:9:16,2
They are pretty good, huh?


158
0:9:16,2 --> 0:9:16,834
All right.


159
0:9:16,834 --> 0:9:17,934
Dump them in.


160
0:9:17,934 --> 0:9:19,667
Good job, guys.


161
0:9:19,667 --> 0:9:25,3
Look at these.


162
0:9:25,3 --> 0:9:30,767
Come on there.


163
0:9:30,767 --> 0:9:37,433
Dump them in.


164
0:9:37,433 --> 0:9:40,834
Pretty good, right?


165
0:9:40,834 --> 0:9:46,867
Yeah.


166
0:9:46,867 --> 0:9:53,2
These are beets.


167
0:9:53,2 --> 0:9:54,33
There you go.


168
0:9:54,33 --> 0:9:56,467
Good job.


169
0:9:56,467 --> 0:9:58,0
No, those don't
need to go in there.


170
0:9:58,0 --> 0:10:2,7
You can just dump
these right here.


171
0:10:2,7 --> 0:10:3,967
You can put them right here.


172
0:10:3,967 --> 0:10:8,33
Pour them out right here.


173
0:10:8,33 --> 0:10:9,1
There you go.


174
0:10:9,1 --> 0:10:10,5
Great job.


175
0:10:10,5 --> 0:10:12,66
Nice.


176
0:10:12,66 --> 0:10:14,333
Child:
What is that?


177
0:10:14,333 --> 0:10:20,7
What is that?


178
0:10:20,7 --> 0:10:23,567
First lady Michelle Obama:
What about the little one?


179
0:10:23,567 --> 0:10:40,567
Child:
What are these for?


180
0:10:40,567 --> 0:10:41,567
Sam Kass:
All right.


181
0:10:41,567 --> 0:10:43,66
Take this basket back to
somebody who needs it.


182
0:10:43,66 --> 0:10:44,433
We don't have enough baskets.


183
0:10:44,433 --> 0:10:47,967
Good job.


184
0:10:47,967 --> 0:10:52,5
Child:
Do you need
anymore baskets?


185
0:10:52,5 --> 0:10:56,967
First Lady Michelle Obama:
I think we are good.


186
0:10:56,967 --> 0:11:8,4
Child:
You need a basket?


187
0:11:8,4 --> 0:11:41,233
First Lady Michelle Obama:
I will take that basket.


188
0:11:41,233 --> 0:11:42,2
Sam Kass:
You can sit down here.


189
0:11:42,2 --> 0:11:42,967
Yes.


190
0:11:42,967 --> 0:11:46,967
You need a basket?


191
0:11:46,967 --> 0:11:47,7
Yes.


192
0:11:47,7 --> 0:11:53,533
First lady Michelle Obama:
You know what, why don't I help you?


193
0:11:53,533 --> 0:11:55,633
Sam Kass:
Awesome.


194
0:11:55,633 --> 0:12:4,767
Perfect.


195
0:12:4,767 --> 0:12:7,367
Keep it in there.


196
0:12:7,367 --> 0:12:15,0
Put it in the basket.


197
0:12:15,0 --> 0:12:25,5
Child:
Look over here.


198
0:12:25,5 --> 0:13:0,5
First lady Michelle Obama:
Okay.


199
0:13:0,5 --> 0:13:5,233
Take it in.


200
0:13:5,233 --> 0:13:14,66
Sam Kass:
You can put these over here.


201
0:13:14,66 --> 0:13:15,633
Good job, guys.


202
0:13:15,633 --> 0:13:19,3
Look at how much food this is.


203
0:13:19,3 --> 0:13:24,233
Sam Kass:
