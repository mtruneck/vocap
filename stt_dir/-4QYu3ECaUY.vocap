###9 Word up Food Tubers. Ok, today we're having a little bit of a picnic. But in, not a normal
###13 place. We're doing on the top of a mountain. Look at that!
###27 That counts, c'mon, that counts! That wasn't down! That was not down.
###31 Absolutely beautiful! Got some friends! Heeeeeeey!
###34 We've put all of this together. Have a little look at this. We have got some beautiful local
###39 cheeses. This is Bang cheese. This is amazing.
###41 How did they make that? I tell you, I do know what they do. They have
###46 a little.. this cheese, this bang cheese, they have it.. it's about 6/7 inches, like
###52 a little Pecorino, they take the top off and they've got this little stirry thing and it
###55 shaves it. Potato salad. A lovely sweet potato, a little
###60 sort of galette with puff pastry, feta, nice bits and pieces. Some salad, some lovely seafood.
###66 Over here we've got some dressing, we've got some roast chicken. Lovely! And a nice little fig and almond tart for dessert.
###73 There you go. Thank you to the CK Verbier posse in the background.
###77 Yaaaaay! Best, best, best chalets and food and everything
###82 on the planet. And to my lovely friends who I love very much.
###85 Yaaaay!!
