0:0:12,3 --> 0:0:13,55
SHANE SMITH: After getting
kicked out of the logging


3
0:0:13,55 --> 0:0:15,44
camp, we headed into
the forest in


4
0:0:15,44 --> 0:0:16,88
search of actual loggers.


5
0:0:16,88 --> 0:0:19,47
The Fish knew all the lumber
hot spots, and, after some


6
0:0:19,47 --> 0:0:21,93
very lurchy driving, he
found us a working


7
0:0:21,93 --> 0:0:23,64
cadre deep in the forest.


8
0:0:23,64 --> 0:0:25,94
This guy is really going
to want to talk to us.


9
0:0:25,94 --> 0:0:28,92
Maybe I should soften it up a
bit with the shotgun before we


10
0:0:28,92 --> 0:0:30,54
get out, so they know
we mean business.


11
0:0:30,54 --> 0:0:31,79
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Good idea.


12
0:0:31,79 --> 0:0:37,22



13
0:0:37,22 --> 0:0:39,33
SHANE SMITH: After our heated
words at the logging camp, we


14
0:0:39,33 --> 0:0:41,8
decided to try to irrigate
the conversation with the


15
0:0:41,8 --> 0:0:43,52
universal tongue-loosener--


16
0:0:43,52 --> 0:0:44,864

0:1:56,68 --> 0:2:6,14



50
0:2:6,14 --> 0:2:7,8
SHANE SMITH: So what he's
saying here is that the


51
0:2:7,8 --> 0:2:12,9
majority of workers have a
10-year-plus labor commitment


52
0:2:12,9 --> 0:2:15,11
to live and work out in
the middle of nowhere


53
0:2:15,11 --> 0:2:16,46
for almost no pay.


54
0:2:16,46 --> 0:2:19,8

off, he seemed confused.
