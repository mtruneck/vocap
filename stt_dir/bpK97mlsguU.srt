1
0:0:2,846 --> 0:0:5,449
- Honey, remember, you have
to make dinner tomorrow night,


2
0:0:5,449 --> 0:0:7,551
Because I have to go to Kevin's
school for that meeting.


3
0:0:7,551 --> 0:0:9,86
- You do?
Why?


4
0:0:9,86 --> 0:0:10,454
- Because your tests came back


5
0:0:10,454 --> 0:0:12,389
And they need to discuss
your mental challenges.


6
0:0:12,389 --> 0:0:15,192
- I have to go to
a fund-raiser meeting.


7
0:0:15,192 --> 0:0:16,76
Why do you think I have to go?


8
0:0:16,76 --> 0:0:18,395
- Fund-raiser meeting?


9
0:0:18,395 --> 0:0:20,3
- Mm-Hmm.


10
0:0:20,3 --> 0:0:22,299
I can't stand these stupid meetings.


11
0:0:22,299 --> 0:0:24,401
And those women get on my nerves.


12
0:0:24,401 --> 0:0:25,469
- How come?


13
0:0:25,469 --> 0:0:28,405
- Because all they do is
nitpick and gossip


14
0:0:28,405 --> 0:0:29,539
And criticize.


15
0:0:29,539 --> 0:0:31,742
And every time I go to one
of these things,


16
0:0:31,742 --> 0:0:34,11
Somehow I end up running another event.


17
0:0:34,11 --> 0:0:36,713
And then all they do
is sit around and say no


18
0:0:36,713 --> 0:0:38,348
To everything I suggest.


19
0:0:38,348 --> 0:0:40,283
And then they wait till the last minute


20
0:0:40,283 --> 0:0:41,952
And look at me like I'm crazy.


21
0:0:41,952 --> 0:0:43,12
Well, I'll tell you what.


22
0:0:43,12 --> 0:0:44,354
They're gonna
have to find another fool.


23
0:0:44,354 --> 0:0:45,355
- I'll tell you what.


24
0:0:45,355 --> 0:0:47,24
Why don't I go with you?


25
0:0:47,24 --> 0:0:48,458
- You don't have to do that.


26
0:0:48,458 --> 0:0:49,626
- Well, yes, I do.


27
0:0:49,626 --> 0:0:50,827
I've seen you mad.


28
0:0:50,827 --> 0:0:52,596
I'm not gonna let you
run around that room


29
0:0:52,596 --> 0:0:55,365
Snatching off wigs and weaves
"Ahh, Ahh!"


30
0:0:55,365 --> 0:0:56,8
Screaming at the top of your voice,


31
0:0:56,8 --> 0:0:58,468
And running up on the roof,
talking about,


32
0:0:58,468 --> 0:0:59,603
"you'll never take me alive!"


33
0:0:59,603 --> 0:1:1,471
And then the police
have to surround the place


34
0:1:1,471 --> 0:1:3,173
With guns and megaphones.


35
0:1:3,173 --> 0:1:4,141
And then they arrest you.


36
0:1:4,141 --> 0:1:6,9
And then I end up a single father.


37
0:1:6,9 --> 0:1:7,11
That's not why I got married.


38
0:1:7,11 --> 0:1:9,579
- Aw, honey.


39
0:1:9,579 --> 0:1:11,214
That's very nice.


40
0:1:11,214 --> 0:1:12,249
What about the kids?


41
0:1:12,249 --> 0:1:14,51
Do you think we need a sitter?


42
0:1:14,51 --> 0:1:15,52
- No.


43
0:1:15,52 --> 0:1:16,42
By the time I was 15,


44
0:1:16,42 --> 0:1:18,555
My mother was leaving me alone
with food, keys, bus fare,


45
0:1:18,555 --> 0:1:20,39
And a couple of blank
post-dated checks


46
0:1:20,39 --> 0:1:21,558
Just in case something came up.


47
0:1:21,558 --> 0:1:23,93
- All right, Lindsey.


48
0:1:23,93 --> 0:1:24,594
You can handle things around here.


49
0:1:24,594 --> 0:1:25,896
But if you want to get paid,


50
0:1:25,896 --> 0:1:27,898
You're actually gonna have
to watch your brother.


51
0:1:27,898 --> 0:1:29,9
- Why would you pay her to watch me


52
0:1:29,9 --> 0:1:32,469
When you can cut a deal with me
to watch myself for free?


53
0:1:32,469 --> 0:1:45,182
- Because we don't negotiate
with terrorists.

55
0:1:49,186 --> 0:1:51,188
- Okay, guys, we'll see you
about 10:00 P.M.


56
0:1:51,188 --> 0:1:52,989
- Nick!


57
0:1:52,989 --> 0:1:57,194
- What?


58
0:1:57,194 --> 0:1:58,595
You're not supposed to tell them


59
0:1:58,595 --> 0:2:0,163
What time we're actually coming back.


60
0:2:0,163 --> 0:2:1,932
You're supposed to tell them
an hour later.


61
0:2:1,932 --> 0:2:3,8
This way, when we come home early,


62
0:2:3,8 --> 0:2:5,35
We can catch them in the act.


63
0:2:5,35 --> 0:2:6,77
- In the act of what?


64
0:2:6,77 --> 0:2:8,105
- Whatever they were doing


65
0:2:8,105 --> 0:2:10,207
When they thought we weren't
coming home for an hour.


66
0:2:10,207 --> 0:2:12,342
- Ooh, that's a good idea.


67
0:2:12,342 --> 0:2:14,44
- Okay.


68
0:2:14,44 --> 0:2:16,613
- Actually, guys, we'll see you
about 11:00.


69
0:2:16,613 --> 0:2:17,647
- 11:00?


70
0:2:17,647 --> 0:2:18,815
Got it.


71
0:2:18,815 --> 0:2:20,15
- Kevin.
- I know, I know.


72
0:2:20,15 --> 0:2:22,319
Behave, clean up the dishes,


73
0:2:22,319 --> 0:2:26,56
Do my homework,
and don't set Lindsey on fire.


74
0:2:26,56 --> 0:2:28,91
- Bye.
- Bye, guys.


75
0:2:28,91 --> 0:2:33,93
- Bye.
- Bye.


76
0:2:33,93 --> 0:2:35,665
- Okay, so here's the deal.


77
0:2:35,665 --> 0:2:36,666
I'm going over to Kelly's,


78
0:2:36,666 --> 0:2:38,34
And I'll be back in about an hour.


79
0:2:38,34 --> 0:2:39,202
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.


80
0:2:39,202 --> 0:2:42,72
What about my dinner?


81
0:2:42,72 --> 0:2:43,373
Here's ten bucks.


82
0:2:43,373 --> 0:2:45,275
Go to up-and-down burger.
It's just a few blocks.


83
0:2:45,275 --> 0:2:46,476
- Whoa, whoa, hey.
Make it $20.


84
0:2:46,476 --> 0:2:49,12
$10 for the burger
and $10 for my sides.


85
0:2:49,12 --> 0:2:51,348
- How much to make you shut up forever?


86
0:2:51,348 --> 0:2:52,949
- Leave and never come back.


87
0:2:52,949 --> 0:2:54,317
- Never gonna happen, bro.


88
0:2:54,317 --> 0:2:58,822
Nice try.


89
0:2:58,822 --> 0:3:0,23
- Okay, take your seats, people.


90
0:3:0,23 --> 0:3:1,725
We're back, we're back, we're back.


91
0:3:1,725 --> 0:3:2,893
Okay, people.


92
0:3:2,893 --> 0:3:4,828
As you know, we are here tonight


93
0:3:4,828 --> 0:3:8,965
To discuss the annual
baby got buck dinner.


94
0:3:8,965 --> 0:3:12,402
- My idea.
Said they hated it.


95
0:3:12,402 --> 0:3:15,705
It was a great idea, so thank you.


96
0:3:15,705 --> 0:3:17,307
It was a huge success last year.


97
0:3:17,307 --> 0:3:18,642
We were able to get books


98
0:3:18,642 --> 0:3:22,145
For the entire fourth grade class.


99
0:3:22,145 --> 0:3:24,648
- It was a great idea, baby.


100
0:3:24,648 --> 0:3:28,819
- As you know, we are going to
need a volunteer chair person.


101
0:3:28,819 --> 0:3:31,254
- What they need is a volunteer sucka.


102
0:3:31,254 --> 0:3:33,59
Ain't gonna be me.


103
0:3:33,59 --> 0:3:34,724
- Okay, I do understand.


104
0:3:34,724 --> 0:3:36,126
It takes a lot of time.


105
0:3:36,126 --> 0:3:38,862
But when you see those kids
coming in to school


106
0:3:38,862 --> 0:3:42,599
Knowing how much work their
parents are doing for them,


107
0:3:42,599 --> 0:3:45,35
It is always worth it.


108
0:3:45,35 --> 0:3:47,404
- Not to me.
- Mm-mm.


109
0:3:47,404 --> 0:3:50,507
- Okay, so I see nobody wants
to volunteer.


110
0:3:50,507 --> 0:3:52,542
- That's 'cause nobody is stupid.


111
0:3:52,542 --> 0:3:53,543
- I have a suggestion.


112
0:3:53,543 --> 0:3:54,778
- She got a suggestion.


113
0:3:54,778 --> 0:3:55,779
- Since last year's event


114
0:3:55,779 --> 0:3:57,347
Was such a huge success...


115
0:3:57,347 --> 0:3:58,815
- Because of me.


116
0:3:58,815 --> 0:4:3,153
- I nominate
Suzanne Kingston-persons.


117
0:4:3,153 --> 0:4:6,957
- What?


118
0:4:6,957 --> 0:4:10,6
- Suzanne, would you?


119
0:4:10,6 --> 0:4:12,62
- Of course I would.


120
0:4:12,62 --> 0:4:13,83
Yay!


121
0:4:13,83 --> 0:4:15,65
- You would?


122
0:4:15,65 --> 0:4:19,469
- Yay, yeah!


123
0:4:19,469 --> 0:4:22,105
- Man, I'll be glad
when I can babysit myself.


124
0:4:22,105 --> 0:4:24,107
Then I won't have to deal
with my stupid sister.


125
0:4:24,107 --> 0:4:25,609
- Don't take it for granted.


126
0:4:25,609 --> 0:4:28,144
Sometimes I wish I had a stupid
sister who hated me


127
0:4:28,144 --> 0:4:29,88
And left me to fend for myself.


128
0:4:29,88 --> 0:4:35,118
You got it good, man.


129
0:4:35,118 --> 0:4:36,887
Aw, man, nothing.


130
0:4:36,887 --> 0:4:39,155
- Yeah, that's usually what that
sound means.


131
0:4:39,155 --> 0:4:41,658
- No, I mean I didn't win the prize.


132
0:4:41,658 --> 0:4:43,426
These are big bonus cups.


133
0:4:43,426 --> 0:4:44,494
When you finish your drink,


134
0:4:44,494 --> 0:4:46,496
The cup reveals a prize at the bottom.


135
0:4:46,496 --> 0:4:47,898
Finish yours and see if you won.


136
0:4:47,898 --> 0:4:52,936
- Oh, okay.


137
0:4:52,936 --> 0:4:54,404
Oh, oh, brain freeze.
Brain freeze.


138
0:4:54,404 --> 0:4:56,773
Ah, ah, I hate those!


139
0:4:56,773 --> 0:4:58,909
- Dude, you won.


140
0:4:58,909 --> 0:5:0,443
- Dude, quit lying!


141
0:5:0,443 --> 0:5:3,58
Let me see that.


142
0:5:3,58 --> 0:5:5,315
$500?


143
0:5:5,315 --> 0:5:6,316
Wait, wait, wait.


144
0:5:6,316 --> 0:5:7,35
$500?


145
0:5:7,35 --> 0:5:8,652
$500...


146
0:5:8,652 --> 0:5:9,986
Five... what?


147
0:5:9,986 --> 0:5:17,26
Hit it!


148
0:5:17,26 --> 0:5:19,729
- Kevin, you know you're not
supposed to have people over.


149
0:5:19,729 --> 0:5:21,631
- Oh, well, I would like to thank you


150
0:5:21,631 --> 0:5:23,333
For leaving me home alone,


151
0:5:23,333 --> 0:5:25,101
Because now I have $500.


152
0:5:25,101 --> 0:5:26,77
What?


153
0:5:26,77 --> 0:5:31,241
- How?


154
0:5:31,241 --> 0:5:32,609
I can't believe this.


155
0:5:32,609 --> 0:5:33,643
- I know.


156
0:5:33,643 --> 0:5:34,945
I can't wait to tell mom and dad.


157
0:5:34,945 --> 0:5:36,513
- No, you can't.


158
0:5:36,513 --> 0:5:38,515
- Why not?
- Allow me.


159
0:5:38,515 --> 0:5:39,616
You can't tell your parents,


160
0:5:39,616 --> 0:5:40,717
Because you weren't supposed


161
0:5:40,717 --> 0:5:41,985
To be out of the house.


162
0:5:41,985 --> 0:5:43,19
If you show them the cup,


163
0:5:43,19 --> 0:5:45,455
They'll know you went out.


164
0:5:45,455 --> 0:5:46,456
That's okay.


165
0:5:46,456 --> 0:5:47,457
I won't tell them.


166
0:5:47,457 --> 0:5:48,758
I'll just go get my money.


167
0:5:48,758 --> 0:5:50,36
- Yeah.
- Yeah!


168
0:5:50,36 --> 0:5:52,95
- Nope, you can't do that either.


169
0:5:52,95 --> 0:5:53,296
- Why?


170
0:5:53,296 --> 0:5:55,498
- It says right here in order
to claim the prize


171
0:5:55,498 --> 0:5:57,233
You have to be at least 18 or older.


172
0:5:57,233 --> 0:6:1,4
- So how are we supposed
to cash the cup in?


173
0:6:1,4 --> 0:6:2,5
- Do you trust me?


174
0:6:2,5 --> 0:6:3,39
- No.


175
0:6:3,39 --> 0:6:4,4
- Let me rephrase that.


176
0:6:4,4 --> 0:6:5,208
Do you want your money?


177
0:6:5,208 --> 0:6:6,309
- Yeah.


178
0:6:6,309 --> 0:6:14,15
- Then you're gonna have to trust me.


179
0:6:14,15 --> 0:6:15,585
- Ha ha!


180
0:6:15,585 --> 0:6:18,154
You didn't think we'd be back
so early, did you?


181
0:6:18,154 --> 0:6:19,456
- Actually, we did.


182
0:6:19,456 --> 0:6:22,258
Mom always comes home an hour
early from meetings.


183
0:6:22,258 --> 0:6:24,961
- Then how come you guys
are sitting on the couch


184
0:6:24,961 --> 0:6:28,398
Watching tv, eating popcorn?


185
0:6:28,398 --> 0:6:30,834
- Because we wanted popcorn?


186
0:6:30,834 --> 0:6:31,835
- Come on.


187
0:6:31,835 --> 0:6:33,336
Watch your tone.


188
0:6:33,336 --> 0:6:34,904
- Now go to bed.


189
0:6:34,904 --> 0:6:38,274
And next time, don't y'all
be trying to outsmart people.


190
0:6:38,274 --> 0:6:39,342
- You're right.


191
0:6:39,342 --> 0:6:43,947
I don't know what we were thinking.


192
0:6:43,947 --> 0:6:47,217
- Can't believe I'm in charge
of this committee again.


193
0:6:47,217 --> 0:6:49,452
- Baby, all you had
to say was "no."


194
0:6:49,452 --> 0:6:51,821
- How do I look standing there
saying "no"


195
0:6:51,821 --> 0:6:54,324
In a room full of people
who are clapping for me,


196
0:6:54,324 --> 0:6:55,625
Including my husband?


197
0:6:55,625 --> 0:6:58,561
- You look like someone
who doesn't want to do it.


198
0:6:58,561 --> 0:7:0,764
- Fine, make fun of me.


199
0:7:0,764 --> 0:7:2,732
- Baby, let me help you with this.


200
0:7:2,732 --> 0:7:3,733
- What are you gonna do?


201
0:7:3,733 --> 0:7:4,834
Go back in your time machine


202
0:7:4,834 --> 0:7:6,69
And not clap when they pick me?


203
0:7:6,69 --> 0:7:12,308
- No, I was thinking I could do it.


204
0:7:12,308 --> 0:7:13,643
You're kidding, right?


205
0:7:13,643 --> 0:7:16,79
Those women are a nightmare.


206
0:7:16,79 --> 0:7:18,948
They will suck you in,
set you up, and spit you out.


207
0:7:18,948 --> 0:7:22,118
- It can't be no worse than what
your kids try to do to me.


208
0:7:22,118 --> 0:7:25,88
Hey, I played football.


209
0:7:25,88 --> 0:7:26,589
I ran a business.


210
0:7:26,589 --> 0:7:30,6
I ain't scared of no moms
and a fund-raiser. Shoot.


211
0:7:30,6 --> 0:7:32,328
- Okay, homey.


212
0:7:32,328 --> 0:7:33,763
But don't come crying back to me


213
0:7:33,763 --> 0:7:36,533
When you get played like a boy band.


214
0:7:36,533 --> 0:7:38,101
Yeah!


215
0:7:38,101 --> 0:7:40,3
- I don't do it like that.


216
0:7:40,3 --> 0:7:41,204
I don't do it like that.


217
0:7:41,204 --> 0:7:43,683
You got to have the swagger.


218
0:7:43,683 --> 0:7:44,784
- So what happened with Suzanne?


219
0:7:44,784 --> 0:7:46,352
Is she okay?
- Oh, she's fine.


220
0:7:46,352 --> 0:7:48,388
She just didn't realize
how swamped she was with work


221
0:7:48,388 --> 0:7:50,189
Before you asked her to chair
the event again.


222
0:7:50,189 --> 0:7:52,992
- Oh, well, if you are anything
at all like her,


223
0:7:52,992 --> 0:7:55,228
I imagine we are in excellent hands.


224
0:7:55,228 --> 0:7:56,929
- Okay, you guys ready to get to work?


225
0:7:56,929 --> 0:7:59,799
- I just want to say,
what you're doing is fantastic.


226
0:7:59,799 --> 0:8:1,801
It's nice to see a dad step up
for a change.


227
0:8:1,801 --> 0:8:3,569
- And it's good to break up


228
0:8:3,569 --> 0:8:4,904
Some of the female energy.


229
0:8:4,904 --> 0:8:10,777
- Kind of like a security guard
at a shoe sale.


230
0:8:10,777 --> 0:8:12,178
- Tell me, Nick.


231
0:8:12,178 --> 0:8:14,313
How did Suzanne convince you


232
0:8:14,313 --> 0:8:16,616
To come down here in her place?


233
0:8:16,616 --> 0:8:18,418
- Well, she didn't.
I volunteered.


234
0:8:18,418 --> 0:8:20,586
Oh!


235
0:8:20,586 --> 0:8:21,854
- That's amazing.


236
0:8:21,854 --> 0:8:24,824
I can barely get my husband
to read a report card.


237
0:8:24,824 --> 0:8:25,858
- Send it to ESPN.


238
0:8:25,858 --> 0:8:31,898
Have them put it on the ticker.


239
0:8:31,898 --> 0:8:35,134
- My husband doesn't even know
where the children go to school.


240
0:8:35,134 --> 0:8:36,402
- Let me tell you something, honey.


241
0:8:36,402 --> 0:8:38,337
Take the tv remote.
Put it in heir backpacks.


242
0:8:38,337 --> 0:8:42,842
He'll find 'em.


243
0:8:42,842 --> 0:8:44,31
- Can we not talk about husbands?


244
0:8:44,31 --> 0:8:46,879
The only reason I don't kill
mine is because I am too lazy


245
0:8:46,879 --> 0:8:49,182
To row his dead body
out to sea and dump it.


246
0:8:49,182 --> 0:8:51,84
- Is that why Suzanne keeps trying


247
0:8:51,84 --> 0:8:54,687
To get me to go on that cruise?


248
0:8:54,687 --> 0:8:58,191
I finally figured that out.


249
0:8:58,191 --> 0:8:59,158
You know what?


250
0:8:59,158 --> 0:9:0,927
I just have to be honest with you guys.


251
0:9:0,927 --> 0:9:3,162
Suzanne said you would be rough on me,


252
0:9:3,162 --> 0:9:4,697
But, you know, you're all right.


253
0:9:4,697 --> 0:9:7,2
- Now, why would she say
something like that?


254
0:9:7,2 --> 0:9:8,367
- We love her.


255
0:9:8,367 --> 0:9:9,836
- If anything,
she's kind of tough on us.


256
0:9:9,836 --> 0:9:10,937
- I know what you mean.


257
0:9:10,937 --> 0:9:14,54
Suzanne does not play.


258
0:9:14,54 --> 0:9:15,541
- You know what?


259
0:9:15,541 --> 0:9:16,542
- We do.


260
0:9:16,542 --> 0:9:17,543
- Ooh, Carol!


261
0:9:17,543 --> 0:9:18,544
- Drinks, anyone?


262
0:9:18,544 --> 0:9:20,847
- Carol, what are you doing?


263
0:9:20,847 --> 0:9:21,881
Oh, my goodness.


264
0:9:21,881 --> 0:9:28,387
Pta stands
for "pass the alcohol."


265
0:9:28,387 --> 0:9:29,822
- So let me see if I've got this right.


266
0:9:29,822 --> 0:9:32,24
You're gonna take the cup
and give it to your friend Eric.


267
0:9:32,24 --> 0:9:33,526
- Eric, right.
- And he's gonna take it


268
0:9:33,526 --> 0:9:34,861
To the place and cash it in.


269
0:9:34,861 --> 0:9:37,63
- Right, then he takes 20 bucks,
and gives the rest to us.


270
0:9:37,63 --> 0:9:38,531
- You mean me.


271
0:9:38,531 --> 0:9:39,866
- No, us.


272
0:9:39,866 --> 0:9:42,34
You need me to cash it in, so it's us.


273
0:9:42,34 --> 0:9:43,369
- But it's my cup.


274
0:9:43,369 --> 0:9:44,704
I bought it


275
0:9:44,704 --> 0:9:47,206
When you left me in the house
by myself.


276
0:9:47,206 --> 0:9:49,8
- Which I'm prepared
to tell mom and dad


277
0:9:49,8 --> 0:9:51,711
If you don't share your money with me.


278
0:9:51,711 --> 0:9:55,414
- So you would tell mom and dad
that you left me alone


279
0:9:55,414 --> 0:9:56,782
Just so I don't get the money,


280
0:9:56,782 --> 0:9:58,518
Even though you know
you'd get in trouble?


281
0:9:58,518 --> 0:10:0,319
- Yeah, they'll forgive me.


282
0:10:0,319 --> 0:10:6,125
- You just took evil
to a whole new level.


283
0:10:6,125 --> 0:10:7,226
- Hey.


284
0:10:7,226 --> 0:10:9,829
I thought you had a school thing
this afternoon.


285
0:10:9,829 --> 0:10:11,931
- I sent Nick in my place.


286
0:10:11,931 --> 0:10:13,399
- Why would you send Nick down there?


287
0:10:13,399 --> 0:10:14,734
You hate those women.


288
0:10:14,734 --> 0:10:15,902
They hate me.


289
0:10:15,902 --> 0:10:16,903
And I was ambushed.


290
0:10:16,903 --> 0:10:18,4
We have another fund-raiser,


291
0:10:18,4 --> 0:10:20,39
And they nominated me
to be chairperson.


292
0:10:20,39 --> 0:10:21,774
- Fund-raising is easy.


293
0:10:21,774 --> 0:10:24,443
You put on a nice dress,
find a man of means,


294
0:10:24,443 --> 0:10:25,978
And tell him what he has to pay for.


295
0:10:25,978 --> 0:10:28,681
- That may work with a trip to Vegas,


296
0:10:28,681 --> 0:10:30,75
But you can't use that on your kids.


297
0:10:30,75 --> 0:10:32,218
- Okay.


298
0:10:32,218 --> 0:10:34,187
So Nick is there.


299
0:10:34,187 --> 0:10:36,88
- Mm-Hmm.


300
0:10:36,88 --> 0:10:37,156
- Hmm.


301
0:10:37,156 --> 0:10:38,925
- "Hmm" what?


302
0:10:38,925 --> 0:10:40,92
- I just, you know, okay.


303
0:10:40,92 --> 0:10:41,694
I don't want to overstep my boundaries,


304
0:10:41,694 --> 0:10:43,829
But I have a question for you.
- What?


305
0:10:43,829 --> 0:10:45,198
- Are you crazy?


306
0:10:45,198 --> 0:10:46,699
These women hate you,


307
0:10:46,699 --> 0:10:49,68
Which means they can't be
trusted around your husband.


308
0:10:49,68 --> 0:10:50,836
- I'm not worried about Nick.


309
0:10:50,836 --> 0:10:53,406
- Well, you should be,
because you and I both know


310
0:10:53,406 --> 0:10:54,373
Men are stupid.


311
0:10:54,373 --> 0:10:56,275
- Nick is not stupid.


312
0:10:56,275 --> 0:10:57,843
- I love you.
Yes, he is.


313
0:10:57,843 --> 0:10:59,278
- Gigi!


314
0:10:59,278 --> 0:11:0,98
- I'm sorry, but you throw a man


315
0:11:0,98 --> 0:11:2,315
In a room with a bunch of women,


316
0:11:2,315 --> 0:11:4,383
He can't help but try to be liked,


317
0:11:4,383 --> 0:11:6,118
Even by women who hate you.


318
0:11:6,118 --> 0:11:8,2
And they know that.


319
0:11:8,2 --> 0:11:9,855
- You're overreacting.


320
0:11:9,855 --> 0:11:10,856
And trust me.


321
0:11:10,856 --> 0:11:12,191
I can handle my man.


322
0:11:12,191 --> 0:11:15,294
And the good news is,
after a hard day's work here,


323
0:11:15,294 --> 0:11:29,909
I don't have to see them.


324
0:11:29,909 --> 0:11:35,181
- Ow, ow!


325
0:11:35,181 --> 0:11:36,882
- Hey, everybody!


326
0:11:36,882 --> 0:11:38,951
- Hey, baby!


327
0:11:38,951 --> 0:11:40,186
Hi, Suzanne.


328
0:11:40,186 --> 0:11:41,12
- Hi!


329
0:11:41,12 --> 0:11:45,496
hi.


330
0:11:45,496 --> 0:11:46,831
- Wow!


331
0:11:46,831 --> 0:11:51,369
Nick, you didn't tell me
all the ladies were coming by.


332
0:11:51,369 --> 0:11:52,837
- Well, it just kind of happened.


333
0:11:52,837 --> 0:11:54,38
Pop!


334
0:11:54,38 --> 0:11:55,84
- You know, we ran over our time
at the school,


335
0:11:55,84 --> 0:11:57,908
But we were on such a role,


336
0:11:57,908 --> 0:12:0,778
I said, "let's just go to their house.


337
0:12:0,778 --> 0:12:1,979
And you have a lovely home.


338
0:12:1,979 --> 0:12:3,13
- Mm-Hmm.


339
0:12:3,13 --> 0:12:4,715
- And Nick is so great.


340
0:12:4,715 --> 0:12:7,118
He said it would be no problem.


341
0:12:7,118 --> 0:12:8,152
- He did?


342
0:12:8,152 --> 0:12:9,253
Mm-Hmm.


343
0:12:9,253 --> 0:12:10,121
- Your husband is quite


344
0:12:10,121 --> 0:12:11,222
The idea man, Suzanne


345
0:12:11,222 --> 0:12:13,19
We love having him on the committee.


346
0:12:13,19 --> 0:12:14,692
- Adore.


347
0:12:14,692 --> 0:12:16,327
- Is that so?


348
0:12:16,327 --> 0:12:19,29
- We are already moving so much
faster than last year.


349
0:12:19,29 --> 0:12:20,131
- Oh, it's amazing.


350
0:12:20,131 --> 0:12:21,832
- Your husband is such a doll.


351
0:12:21,832 --> 0:12:26,303
- Oh, he is, isn't he?


352
0:12:26,303 --> 0:12:28,773
Nick, can I show you something
I brought home from work?


353
0:12:28,773 --> 0:12:29,807
- Oh, can it wait?


354
0:12:29,807 --> 0:12:30,841
We're almost done here.


355
0:12:30,841 --> 0:12:32,41
- Not really.


356
0:12:32,41 --> 0:12:37,114
It kind of has something
to do with your health.


357
0:12:37,114 --> 0:12:39,183
- Okay, well,


358
0:12:39,183 --> 0:12:40,217
Keep it moving.


359
0:12:40,217 --> 0:12:41,719
Bend it;
don't break it.


360
0:12:41,719 --> 0:12:48,192
We'll be right back.


361
0:12:48,192 --> 0:12:50,828
- Nick, you know I can't stand
those women.


362
0:12:50,828 --> 0:12:52,329
Why would you have them here?


363
0:12:52,329 --> 0:12:53,664
- We got caught up.


364
0:12:53,664 --> 0:12:56,0
- I mean, everyone has something
going on at their houses.


365
0:12:56,0 --> 0:12:57,134
- They were lying.


366
0:12:57,134 --> 0:12:58,869
They're just trying to get
in our business.


367
0:12:58,869 --> 0:13:0,938
I can't believe you fell for that.


368
0:13:0,938 --> 0:13:2,373
- Fell for what?


369
0:13:2,373 --> 0:13:4,8
You're being paranoid.


370
0:13:4,8 --> 0:13:6,143
Those ladies are out there
trying to figure out a way


371
0:13:6,143 --> 0:13:7,144
To make money for the kids.


372
0:13:7,144 --> 0:13:8,946
You said they were gossips,


373
0:13:8,946 --> 0:13:11,949
But they haven't said anything
but nice things about you.


374
0:13:11,949 --> 0:13:13,517
They love my ideas,


375
0:13:13,517 --> 0:13:15,252
And you know, this might be shocking,


376
0:13:15,252 --> 0:13:17,555
But I think they're quite nice.


377
0:13:17,555 --> 0:13:20,391
- The only reason they're being
nice to you


378
0:13:20,391 --> 0:13:22,59
Is so that they can get at me.


379
0:13:22,59 --> 0:13:24,428
- Is it possible that they could
just like me?


380
0:13:24,428 --> 0:13:26,397
- No!


381
0:13:26,397 --> 0:13:27,631
Because they know that I don't
like them.


382
0:13:27,631 --> 0:13:29,99
And they know that if they're
nice to you,


383
0:13:29,99 --> 0:13:31,235
You're gonna come back
and tell me how nice they are.


384
0:13:31,235 --> 0:13:33,471
And it's gonna get under my skin
like it is right now.


385
0:13:33,471 --> 0:13:36,941
- You guys almost finished?
- Aw, yes, Melissa.


386
0:13:36,941 --> 0:13:38,676
Nick will be right back out.
Thanks so much.


387
0:13:38,676 --> 0:13:40,478
- I was just telling the ladies
it's so nice


388
0:13:40,478 --> 0:13:41,879
That Nick is such a great husband,


389
0:13:41,879 --> 0:13:43,147
Especially since you work


390
0:13:43,147 --> 0:13:45,249
And can't be with your kids
like you want to.


391
0:13:45,249 --> 0:13:46,383
- It is.


392
0:13:46,383 --> 0:13:47,885
I'm blessed.


393
0:13:47,885 --> 0:13:53,9
- By the way,
your kitchen is so...Charming.


394
0:13:53,9 --> 0:13:55,25
- You see what I mean?


395
0:13:55,25 --> 0:13:56,227
- No!


396
0:13:56,227 --> 0:13:57,561
Look, baby,


397
0:13:57,561 --> 0:13:59,96
If I thought for one minute


398
0:13:59,96 --> 0:14:1,198
That those ladies had
anything against you,


399
0:14:1,198 --> 0:14:2,633
Believe me, they would be out of here


400
0:14:2,633 --> 0:14:3,767
Faster than you could say,
"backstab."


401
0:14:3,767 --> 0:14:6,37
- Backstab.


402
0:14:6,37 --> 0:14:8,172
- Oh, look.


403
0:14:8,172 --> 0:14:9,139
You know what?


404
0:14:9,139 --> 0:14:10,14
You don't like them.


405
0:14:10,14 --> 0:14:11,509
I understand it.


406
0:14:11,509 --> 0:14:13,611
But I just cannot go out there
and kick them out of here.


407
0:14:13,611 --> 0:14:14,612
- You could.


408
0:14:14,612 --> 0:14:15,88
You won't, but you could.


409
0:14:15,88 --> 0:14:17,581
- You know what, sweetheart?


410
0:14:17,581 --> 0:14:19,316
If it means that much to you,


411
0:14:19,316 --> 0:14:21,719
I'm just gonna go out there,
and I'm gonna end the meeting.


412
0:14:21,719 --> 0:14:27,992
- Thank you.


413
0:14:27,992 --> 0:14:29,66
- All right, here's the cup.


414
0:14:29,66 --> 0:14:31,295
- There's been a change
in the agreement.


415
0:14:31,295 --> 0:14:33,3
I want $100.


416
0:14:33,3 --> 0:14:34,64
- $100?


417
0:14:34,64 --> 0:14:35,766
- Either that, or find somebody else.


418
0:14:35,766 --> 0:14:37,134
- $40.


419
0:14:37,134 --> 0:14:38,669
$75.


420
0:14:38,669 --> 0:14:40,4
- $50.


421
0:14:40,4 --> 0:14:42,54
And if you don't do it,
we'll get a homeless guy.


422
0:14:42,54 --> 0:14:43,607
- Fine.


423
0:14:43,607 --> 0:14:45,109
- We'll meet you tomorrow night.


424
0:14:45,109 --> 0:14:46,477
- Okay, that it?


425
0:14:46,477 --> 0:14:48,779
- One more thing?
- What?


426
0:14:48,779 --> 0:14:50,247
- Keep your mouth shut.


427
0:14:50,247 --> 0:14:51,749
- Get your finger off me.


428
0:14:51,749 --> 0:14:54,118
- I'm sorry.


429
0:14:54,118 --> 0:14:55,92
- What is wrong with you, man?


430
0:14:55,92 --> 0:14:59,39
Get in the house.


431
0:14:59,39 --> 0:15:1,892
- Baby, I'm sorry that those
ladies don't like you.


432
0:15:1,892 --> 0:15:4,628
But I can't help it if they like me.


433
0:15:4,628 --> 0:15:7,464
- For the last time,
they don't like you.


434
0:15:7,464 --> 0:15:9,366
They're doing it to annoy me.


435
0:15:9,366 --> 0:15:10,701
- Prove it.


436
0:15:10,701 --> 0:15:11,869
- Okay, you want me to prove it?


437
0:15:11,869 --> 0:15:12,87
I'll prove it.


438
0:15:12,87 --> 0:15:14,4
What is this idea you have


439
0:15:14,4 --> 0:15:16,54
That the ladies think is so wonderful?


440
0:15:16,54 --> 0:15:20,778
- Well, I suggested the
fund-raiser be '80s funk themed.


441
0:15:20,778 --> 0:15:22,146
Huh?


442
0:15:22,146 --> 0:15:24,114
- And what does that mean, exactly?


443
0:15:24,114 --> 0:15:25,316
- You know,


444
0:15:25,316 --> 0:15:28,519
Shoulder pads, space suits, codpieces.


445
0:15:28,519 --> 0:15:30,187
Ow!


446
0:15:30,187 --> 0:15:32,256
- And where are you supposed to
get these codpieces,


447
0:15:32,256 --> 0:15:34,491
At a cameo yard sale?


448
0:15:34,491 --> 0:15:36,827
- I don't know.
A costume store?


449
0:15:36,827 --> 0:15:38,662
- In the spring?


450
0:15:38,662 --> 0:15:40,764
Who do you know that carries
costumes in the spring


451
0:15:40,764 --> 0:15:42,566
Or are you just gonna make
your space suits


452
0:15:42,566 --> 0:15:44,768
Out of aluminum foil?


453
0:15:44,768 --> 0:15:46,637
- No.


454
0:15:46,637 --> 0:15:49,54
- Nick, these ladies couldn't
plan a bottle opening.


455
0:15:49,54 --> 0:15:51,508
They don't know a good idea
from a bad idea


456
0:15:51,508 --> 0:15:52,643
When they hear one.


457
0:15:52,643 --> 0:15:55,512
- Well, my next idea
was a Mardi Gras party.


458
0:15:55,512 --> 0:15:57,114
- Mardi gras?
- Mm-Hmm.


459
0:15:57,114 --> 0:15:58,215
- Okay, when's the party?


460
0:15:58,215 --> 0:15:59,583
- April.


461
0:15:59,583 --> 0:16:1,652
- A mardi gras party in April?


462
0:16:1,652 --> 0:16:3,187
- Sure.
Why not?


463
0:16:3,187 --> 0:16:5,689
- Because mardi gras is in February.


464
0:16:5,689 --> 0:16:9,493
- It's a mardi gras party.
Not mardi gras.


465
0:16:9,493 --> 0:16:12,162
- Okay, what day in April?


466
0:16:12,162 --> 0:16:15,633
- April 15th.


467
0:16:15,633 --> 0:16:17,301
- Tax day?


468
0:16:17,301 --> 0:16:19,47
You're seriously going to plan
a fund-raiser


469
0:16:19,47 --> 0:16:23,507
On the day people
have to file their taxes?


470
0:16:23,507 --> 0:16:30,147
- Well, not anymore.


471
0:16:30,147 --> 0:16:31,348
So you guys don't think


472
0:16:31,348 --> 0:16:33,651
It's weird celebrating
mardi gras in April?


473
0:16:33,651 --> 0:16:35,719
- Oh, no, not at all, Nick.


474
0:16:35,719 --> 0:16:37,154
It's a theme party.


475
0:16:37,154 --> 0:16:39,99
- I have Easter themed parties
in September all the time.


476
0:16:39,99 --> 0:16:42,526
- But we're scheduling it for tax day.


477
0:16:42,526 --> 0:16:43,627
- All the better.


478
0:16:43,627 --> 0:16:45,329
People will want to celebrate.


479
0:16:45,329 --> 0:16:47,364
- It can be a mardi tax day party.


480
0:16:47,364 --> 0:16:48,365
- Ladies, no.


481
0:16:48,365 --> 0:16:50,267
These are all bad ideas.


482
0:16:50,267 --> 0:16:52,136
- Oh, Nick, Nick.


483
0:16:52,136 --> 0:16:54,71
It doesn't really matter.


484
0:16:54,71 --> 0:16:55,72
We'll make it work.


485
0:16:55,72 --> 0:16:56,106
We'll figure it out.


486
0:16:56,106 --> 0:16:57,241
- We're just glad you're here.


487
0:16:57,241 --> 0:16:58,342
- Right.


488
0:16:58,342 --> 0:16:59,977
Things are so much better
than last year.


489
0:16:59,977 --> 0:17:2,78
- You mean when Suzanne was here?


490
0:17:2,78 --> 0:17:4,14
- Well...


491
0:17:4,14 --> 0:17:6,25
- I hear you.
It's okay.


492
0:17:6,25 --> 0:17:9,53
So you do agree that
these ideas are bad?


493
0:17:9,53 --> 0:17:10,688
- A little.


494
0:17:10,688 --> 0:17:11,722
- A lot.


495
0:17:11,722 --> 0:17:13,123
- Okay.


496
0:17:13,123 --> 0:17:14,425
Here's another idea.


497
0:17:14,425 --> 0:17:16,326
You're probably gonna hate it.


498
0:17:16,326 --> 0:17:17,628
But I think it's gonna work.


499
0:17:17,628 --> 0:17:21,432
- We're all ears.


500
0:17:21,432 --> 0:17:23,233
- Can you hear me now?


501
0:17:23,233 --> 0:17:24,702
- Suzanne, terrific.


502
0:17:24,702 --> 0:17:26,87
- Oh, Carol, just zip it.


503
0:17:26,87 --> 0:17:29,673
You're trying to play me
like the quick pick.


504
0:17:29,673 --> 0:17:32,91
You put on a bigger show
than lady gaga at the grammy's.


505
0:17:32,91 --> 0:17:34,678
- I don't know
what you're talking about.


506
0:17:34,678 --> 0:17:36,814
- "I don't know
what you're talking about."


507
0:17:36,814 --> 0:17:38,182
That's because you're so fake


508
0:17:38,182 --> 0:17:40,451
You don't know you have
a real problem on your hands.


509
0:17:40,451 --> 0:17:41,385
- Suzanne...


510
0:17:41,385 --> 0:17:43,153
- Oh, you want some?
Here you go.


511
0:17:43,153 --> 0:17:46,49
- Melissa, your kids are stupid.


512
0:17:46,49 --> 0:17:47,658
- That's crossing the line.


513
0:17:47,658 --> 0:17:49,93
- No, no, that's telling the truth.


514
0:17:49,93 --> 0:17:51,462
Crossing the line
is asking your husband


515
0:17:51,462 --> 0:17:53,297
Why he's always down at the math class


516
0:17:53,297 --> 0:17:56,433
Talking to the 22-year-old
teacher's aid.


517
0:17:56,433 --> 0:17:58,202
That's right.
Tap out.


518
0:17:58,202 --> 0:17:59,369
- That was uncalled for.


519
0:17:59,369 --> 0:18:1,371
- Oh, you got something
you want to say, Theresa?


520
0:18:1,371 --> 0:18:3,73
- I think we should go.


521
0:18:3,73 --> 0:18:5,609
- Oh, give that woman a hand,


522
0:18:5,609 --> 0:18:7,878
Because that is the first good idea


523
0:18:7,878 --> 0:18:9,98
That she has had in her whole life.


524
0:18:9,98 --> 0:18:12,182
Kick rocks.


525
0:18:12,182 --> 0:18:13,383
Bye-bye.


526
0:18:13,383 --> 0:18:17,588
- See, I don't need y'all
to plan nothing.


527
0:18:17,588 --> 0:18:20,29
Don't, don't, 'cause I got
vaseline in my purse, Carol.


528
0:18:20,29 --> 0:18:22,96
You better turn that around.


529
0:18:22,96 --> 0:18:29,848
I'll snap your fingers right off.


530
0:18:29,848 --> 0:18:31,983
- Okay, here's your cut.


531
0:18:31,983 --> 0:18:33,51
$440.


532
0:18:33,51 --> 0:18:34,986
- Say what?


533
0:18:34,986 --> 0:18:36,788
Did he just say...
yeah, I think he did. Yeah.


534
0:18:36,788 --> 0:18:38,256
- Okay, we agreed on $450.


535
0:18:38,256 --> 0:18:39,291
That's ten bucks short.


536
0:18:39,291 --> 0:18:40,458
- Transaction fee.


537
0:18:40,458 --> 0:18:41,726
- You're not even a bank.


538
0:18:41,726 --> 0:18:44,396
- Dude, everybody charges
transaction fees.


539
0:18:44,396 --> 0:18:45,463
It's like taxes.


540
0:18:45,463 --> 0:18:47,332
You can't get around them.


541
0:18:47,332 --> 0:18:48,967
- Just take the money, Kevin.


542
0:18:48,967 --> 0:18:50,902
- Fine.


543
0:18:50,902 --> 0:18:53,939
Oh, I can't believe it.


544
0:18:53,939 --> 0:18:54,973
I'm rich!


545
0:18:54,973 --> 0:18:59,377
Hit it!


546
0:18:59,377 --> 0:19:1,68
- Ah, I'll just
roll around in it naked.


547
0:19:1,68 --> 0:19:3,148
- I know!


548
0:19:3,148 --> 0:19:11,323
- Let me get my cut first.


549
0:19:11,323 --> 0:19:14,593
- Baby, baby.


550
0:19:14,593 --> 0:19:17,529
That was exactly what I was
trying to avoid


551
0:19:17,529 --> 0:19:19,3
By me taking over for you.


552
0:19:19,3 --> 0:19:20,332
The only thing missing


553
0:19:20,332 --> 0:19:22,968
Was you on the roof
with a wig and a weave


554
0:19:22,968 --> 0:19:24,2
Screaming at the police.


555
0:19:24,2 --> 0:19:28,206
"Ahh!
You'll never take me alive!"


556
0:19:28,206 --> 0:19:30,442
"I'm still alive!"


557
0:19:30,442 --> 0:19:32,344
"Ahh!"


558
0:19:32,344 --> 0:19:34,713
Okay, I'm trying to tell you.


559
0:19:34,713 --> 0:19:36,181
Look, the joke is still on you though.


560
0:19:36,181 --> 0:19:37,682
- Oh, really?


561
0:19:37,682 --> 0:19:39,317
And how is that?


562
0:19:39,317 --> 0:19:42,387
- Well, you are chairman
of yet another committee.


563
0:19:42,387 --> 0:19:44,422
- Darn it.


564
0:19:44,422 --> 0:19:46,291
Well, I'm not doing it again next year.


565
0:19:46,291 --> 0:19:47,459
You can count on that.


566
0:19:47,459 --> 0:19:49,94
- Until they call your name.


567
0:19:49,94 --> 0:19:51,563
You can count on that.


568
0:19:51,563 --> 0:19:53,164
"stop it."


569
0:19:53,164 --> 0:19:55,533
- Stop.


570
0:19:55,533 --> 0:19:57,569
Hey, you realize something?


571
0:19:57,569 --> 0:19:58,837
- No, what?


572
0:19:58,837 --> 0:20:0,839
- It's quiet.


573
0:20:0,839 --> 0:20:10,815
- Too quiet.


574
0:20:10,815 --> 0:20:15,72
- Just remember, no buying
any big-ticket items.


575
0:20:15,72 --> 0:20:18,923
No cars, no houses,


576
0:20:18,923 --> 0:20:20,892
No nothing.


577
0:20:20,892 --> 0:20:23,928
Don't spend it on dames, booze.


578
0:20:23,928 --> 0:20:26,31
Stay away from the ponies.


579
0:20:26,31 --> 0:20:27,832
- The ponies?


580
0:20:27,832 --> 0:20:29,234
- Got to lay low for a while.


581
0:20:29,234 --> 0:20:32,203
Start doing stuff like that,


582
0:20:32,203 --> 0:20:34,72
They're likely to tip off the feds.


583
0:20:34,72 --> 0:20:37,42
- What year do you think this is?


584
0:20:37,42 --> 0:20:38,43
- Oh, Eric,


585
0:20:38,43 --> 0:20:39,377
Dude, you better get out of here.


586
0:20:39,377 --> 0:20:40,845
- No worries.
It's only 9:00.


587
0:20:40,845 --> 0:20:42,747

588
0:20:42,747 --> 0:20:43,982
Which means we have

589
0:20:43,982 --> 0:20:46,718

590
0:20:46,718 --> 0:20:51,289
- You'll never take me alive, coppers!


591
0:20:51,289 --> 0:20:53,692
- Freeze!


592
0:20:53,692 --> 0:20:55,26
- It worked.


593
0:20:55,26 --> 0:20:57,587
- Mm-Hmm.
