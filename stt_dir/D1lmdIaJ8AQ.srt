PAUL KAHAN: I've been
in Chicago for the


3
0:0:8,69 --> 0:0:10,38
better part of 48 years.


4
0:0:10,38 --> 0:0:12,62
And I've been cooking basically
my whole life, but


5
0:0:12,62 --> 0:0:16,3
I've been cooking professionally
about 28 years.


6
0:0:16,3 --> 0:0:18,64
You guys want to stay and have
a drink, you should.


7
0:0:18,64 --> 0:0:23,19
My name is Paul Kahan, I am
the executive chef, a word


8
0:0:23,19 --> 0:0:25,97
that I've never wanted to
attach to my name but


9
0:0:25,97 --> 0:0:28,3
unfortunately I have to.


10
0:0:28,3 --> 0:0:32,439
I am the executive chef for

11
0:0:32,439 --> 0:0:33,59

12
0:0:33,59 --> 0:0:35,84
I don't get to cook as much
as I would like anymore,


13
0:0:35,84 --> 0:0:36,75
unfortunately.


14
0:0:36,75 --> 0:0:37,81
When I do, it's joyous.


15
0:0:37,81 --> 0:0:42,21
I guess I'd say that I am
a motivator, organizer,


16
0:0:42,21 --> 0:0:46,3
conceptualizer, numbers guy,
concept guy, market guy,


17
0:0:46,3 --> 0:0:53,69
forager, food lover, goofball,
political man.

First restaurant that
I was part owner of.


25
0:1:17,6 --> 0:1:19,8
I get the question all the time,
what are your favorite


26
0:1:19,8 --> 0:1:20,14
food trends of the year?


27
0:1:20,14 --> 0:1:22,55
Which makes me want
to spit blood.


28
0:1:22,55 --> 0:1:24,1
And I say the same
thing every time.


29
0:1:24,1 --> 0:1:26,71
The only food trend for
us is great food,


30
0:1:26,71 --> 0:1:28,24
great wine, great service.


31
0:1:28,24 --> 0:1:30,14
I remember people telling me
that we're at Blackbird for


32
0:1:30,14 --> 0:1:32,17
the first time in year 10, and
that this is a great new


33
0:1:32,17 --> 0:1:32,68

34
0:1:32,68 --> 0:1:33,52
It feels new.

really, really nice people.

47
0:2:6,51 --> 0:2:7,23
great simple food.

I mean, the place is a salad,
three pizzas, cookies or

itself.

grate it, it turns into slime.

178
0:7:1,5 --> 0:7:4,55
conceptualize based on a food
sound bite, basically.


179
0:7:4,55 --> 0:7:5,77
For the Publican, the
sound bite was


180
0:7:5,77 --> 0:7:7,15
oysters, pork, and beer.


181
0:7:7,15 --> 0:7:10,17
And I'd test it out
with chefs.

They're like, what's your next
restaurant going to be?


183

And I'd say, oysters,
pork, and beer.

0:7:13,8 --> 0:7:15,4
And everyone would be like,
how could that be bad?


185
0:7:15,4 --> 0:7:17,97
We like to take flavors from
all around the world.


186
0:7:17,97 --> 0:7:22,12
From Germany and from Belgium,
we'll do a schnitzel with


187
0:7:22,12 --> 0:7:24,17
Mediterranean flavors
on top of it.


188
0:7:24,17 --> 0:7:27,73
The other concepts are so
tightly defined and we don't


189
0:7:27,73 --> 0:7:30,24
stray outside the flavors
that define the place.


190
0:7:30,24 --> 0:7:31,7

do whatever the hell we


191

comes from Tunisia.

the name of it?

named Lior who has a

0:8:0,405 --> 0:8:0,89

these ideas on

about eating it.

0:8:12,91 --> 0:8:21,4



213
0:8:21,4 --> 0:8:21,34
Come on!


214
0:8:21,34 --> 0:8:22,88
Dude, give them some
fucking beer!


215
0:8:22,88 --> 0:8:26,1
You know, these guys
are drinking Point?


216
0:8:26,1 --> 0:8:28,621
MALE SPEAKER: I'm
drinking Point.


217
0:8:28,621 --> 0:8:32,3
MICHAEL MCAVENA: Everyone else
is drinking cider and Cezanne.


218
0:8:32,3 --> 0:8:34,343
I don't know why these gentlemen
are drinking


219
0:8:34,343 --> 0:8:34,952
[? Point ?].


220
0:8:34,952 --> 0:8:36,413
Well, whatever you guys want.


221
0:8:36,413 --> 0:8:37,387
The bar is yours.


222
0:8:37,387 --> 0:8:39,299
PAUL KAHAN: Get more beer,
the bar is yours.


223
0:8:39,299 --> 0:8:41,88
We have these giant weiss beer
glasses that Michael got.


224
0:8:41,88 --> 0:8:43,19
I call him the beer
boy, my wife gets


225
0:8:43,19 --> 0:8:43,95
mad at me, but he's--


226
0:8:43,95 --> 0:8:47,91
I don't know, in his mid- 20s
and he looks like he's 14.


227
0:8:47,91 --> 0:8:50,56
But he's an incredible beer guy,
and I guess him and David


228
0:8:50,56 --> 0:8:53,3
were hanging out by the bar,
and David talked about the


229
0:8:53,3 --> 0:8:54,57
soda fountain thing called
the suicide.


230
0:8:54,57 --> 0:8:56,88
Where you take one
of everything.


231
0:8:56,88 --> 0:8:59,34
We have 12 beers on tap, so
they filled it up with 12


232
0:8:59,34 --> 0:9:0,59
different beers.


233
0:9:0,59 --> 0:9:2,42



234
0:9:2,42 --> 0:9:2,9
BEN FASMAN: What's in there?


235
0:9:2,9 --> 0:9:7,38
MICHAEL MCAVENA: We made the
first beer suicide, ever, at


236
0:9:7,38 --> 0:9:7,7
the Publican.


237
0:9:7,7 --> 0:9:9,12
BEN FASMAN: What's in there?


238
0:9:9,12 --> 0:9:11,872
MICHAEL MCAVENA: Every single
thing we have on tap.


239
0:9:11,872 --> 0:9:12,818
BEN FASMAN: Come on,
that's disgusting.


240
0:9:12,818 --> 0:9:15,19
I'm going to barf.


241
0:9:15,19 --> 0:9:16,53
LAURENT LEBEC: I'll definitely
take a sip of it.


242
0:9:16,53 --> 0:9:18,91
PAUL KAHAN: And then a drunken
guy, me, started pouring


243
0:9:18,91 --> 0:9:20,81
whiskey in it as we went.


244
0:9:20,81 --> 0:9:23,14
It was really fun, with
all the cooks.


245
0:9:23,14 --> 0:9:24,87
I think they were like, we've
got to get out of here.


246
0:9:24,87 --> 0:9:29,99



247
0:9:29,99 --> 0:9:30,7
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, yeah.


248
0:9:30,7 --> 0:9:31,8
Tasty.


249
0:9:31,8 --> 0:9:31,8
It's pretty good, man.


250
0:9:31,8 --> 0:9:33,105
We should put that on
the brunch menu.


251
0:9:33,105 --> 0:9:36,456



252
0:9:36,456 --> 0:9:37,944
Come on, David.


253
0:9:37,944 --> 0:9:41,92



254
0:9:41,92 --> 0:9:47,5
If you can't finish that,
you're such a pussy.


255
0:9:47,5 --> 0:9:49,96
Pull it back, pull it back.


256
0:9:49,96 --> 0:9:50,445
You got it!


257
0:9:50,445 --> 0:9:52,385
Take it, take it!


258
0:9:52,385 --> 0:9:56,75
[APPLAUSE]


259
0:9:56,75 --> 0:9:57,54
PAUL KAHAN: I think we probably
should have filled it


260
0:9:57,54 --> 0:9:59,46
up again and done it again.


261
0:9:59,46 --> 0:10:2,13
But that's the alcohol still
in my system talking.


262
0:10:2,13 --> 0:10:4,86



263
0:10:4,86 --> 0:10:5,74
MALE SPEAKER: Prost.


264
0:10:5,74 --> 0:10:8,685
Prost.


265
0:10:8,685 --> 0:10:8,922
Come on, Michael.


266
0:10:8,922 --> 0:10:10,172
Come on, man.


267
0:10:10,172 --> 0:10:12,485



268
0:10:12,485 --> 0:10:12,97
It doesn't get any more
fucked up than this.


269
0:10:12,97 --> 0:10:14,25
PAUL KAHAN: That was so wrong.


270
0:10:14,25 --> 0:12:14,25
