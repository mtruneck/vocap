I love to cook, but sometimes after a hard
days' work, I just want to come home and have


2
0:0:13,9 --> 0:0:16,669
food magically appear on my plate. Can you
please recommend a one pot recipe of guaranteed


3
0:0:16,669 --> 0:0:22,21
good grub. Thank you!
One pot cooking's really great because it


4
0:0:22,21 --> 0:0:25,99
saves you time, you can get really amazing
depth of flavour in there. I have a really


5
0:0:25,99 --> 0:0:30,38
good recipe that hopefully Fiona will really
like. A lovely beef and ale stew and there's


6
0:0:30,38 --> 0:0:33,629
loads of variations on it. But I think it's
a good place to start.


7
0:0:33,629 --> 0:0:40,53
In the base of your one pot dish you want
to use two onions, two cloves of garlic, two


8
0:0:40,53 --> 0:0:46,729
carrots, two celery, two bay leaves. All you
want to do is peel and roughly chop them,


9
0:0:46,729 --> 0:0:51,96
put it all in a pan. This is not your one
pot pan, this is a different pan. On the heat,


10
0:0:51,96 --> 0:0:57,9
you can just add it all to the slow cooker.
But to get more flavour. It's better to just


11
0:0:57,9 --> 0:1:3,689
spend. 10 to 15minutes cooking off this base
bit first, and then adding it into here.


12
0:1:3,689 --> 0:1:8,36
In here I've got 400g of stewing beef. So
that will serve about four to six people.


13
0:1:8,36 --> 0:1:11,76
With slow cooking you want to use the cheaper
cuts of meat because they tend to be the cuts


14
0:1:11,76 --> 0:1:16,84
that are tighter so then when you slow cook
it, it kind of breaks it down. The meat kind


15
0:1:16,84 --> 0:1:21,4
of goes ahhh.
I'm going to add flour, this will coat the


16
0:1:21,4 --> 0:1:27,35
beef and also help thicken the sauce. Salt
and pepper's going to go in here too. Just


17
0:1:27,35 --> 0:1:31,659
toss it all around so you get a nice coating
on the beef.


18
0:1:31,659 --> 0:1:35,64
And then I'm also going to add this to my
base ingredients. Just to brown it off for


19
0:1:35,64 --> 0:1:42,49
literally five minutes. You can see it's slightly
coloured, keeps the flavour in. Fiona, you


20
0:1:42,49 --> 0:1:48,89
don't have to do this, but I think it's good
to take this time. You know, 20minutes in


21
0:1:48,89 --> 0:1:54,17
total max. To cook all this off to then put
it in here and then you can leave it for hours


22
0:1:54,17 --> 0:1:57,2
and hours.
This one we're doing is beef and ale which


23
0:1:57,2 --> 0:2:3,0
is a classic. You can do chicken and white
wine, you could do pork and cider, you could


24
0:2:3,0 --> 0:2:7,44
do lamb red wine. So yeah, those are the classic
combinations.


25
0:2:7,44 --> 0:2:17,8
So this is now ready to go in here. So that's
on. Different cookers will have different


26
0:2:17,8 --> 0:2:21,34
settings. You probably want it on sort of
medium because the lower the setting, the


27
0:2:21,34 --> 0:2:30,819
longer the time you can keep it in there for.
I'm going to add, one tin of chopped tomatoes.


28
0:2:30,819 --> 0:2:35,58
And then some ale, 500mls. That all goes in.
Just give it a mix around.


29
0:2:35,58 --> 0:2:43,48
It will all cook off, it won't be sort of
alcoholic. Now, just going to put the lid


30
0:2:43,48 --> 0:2:52,52
on and then that's it! Four, five hours later.
Done.


31
0:2:52,52 --> 0:2:58,73
So, this has been cooking for four to five
hours. If you were coming in from work take


32
0:2:58,73 --> 0:3:3,14
the lid off and then just leave it without
the lid on cooking for like 20minutes. Just


33
0:3:3,14 --> 0:3:7,709
to thicken it up a bit. Just let's the liquid
evaporate slightly. Obviously it's all cooked


34
0:3:7,709 --> 0:3:11,45
and lovely. You can see the meat is starting
to break down a bit, it's thickened up.


35
0:3:11,45 --> 0:3:17,89
Bay leaves, remember to take those out. You
don't want to eat a whole bayleaf.


36
0:3:17,89 --> 0:3:23,73
Let's serve up, I have got for you some mash
and then some nice savoy cabbage.


37
0:3:23,73 --> 0:3:30,54
This is a pretty simple beef and ale stew,
but you can make it more complicated if you


38
0:3:30,54 --> 0:3:37,27
want to. To the base you can add marmalade
or Worcestershire sauce or tomato puree.


39
0:3:37,27 --> 0:4:5,53
This is the perfect one pot recipe. Leave
it, you don't have to worry about it. Perfect.
