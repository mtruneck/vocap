1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:6,8



2
0:0:6,8 --> 0:0:8,144
MALE SPEAKER 1: Hey.


3
0:0:8,144 --> 0:0:11,13
What time is it?


4
0:0:11,13 --> 0:0:14,8
Right now, what time is it?


5
0:0:14,8 --> 0:0:15,635
ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: 7:15.


6
0:0:15,635 --> 0:0:17,72
MALE SPEAKER 1: 7:15 what?


7
0:0:17,72 --> 0:0:20,36
ANTHONY PAPPALARDO:
In the morning.


8
0:0:20,36 --> 0:0:24,36
Gotta get a little footage, but
can't even have a board.


9
0:0:24,36 --> 0:0:25,75
Joke!


10
0:0:25,75 --> 0:0:27,85
Look what you're making
me skate.


11
0:0:27,85 --> 0:0:29,52
You forget to send me boards.


12
0:0:29,52 --> 0:0:34,27
Look at this soggy, chipped
piece of wood that you expect


13
0:0:34,27 --> 0:0:36,7
me to get footage on.


14
0:0:36,7 --> 0:0:38,0
Are you serious?


15
0:0:38,0 --> 0:0:46,17



16
0:0:46,17 --> 0:0:49,4
I was going to Philly a lot, and
then I just finished high


17
0:0:49,4 --> 0:0:54,46
school, and Bill had a house out
there with his girlfriend


18
0:0:54,46 --> 0:0:55,77
at the time.


19
0:0:55,77 --> 0:0:59,65
I just was staying with him a
lot of weekends and stuff and


20
0:0:59,65 --> 0:1:2,67
ended up just getting my
own place out there.


21
0:1:2,67 --> 0:1:8,28
Still at that time, 17 years
old, skating was so consuming,


22
0:1:8,28 --> 0:1:11,97
and Philadelphia was complete
skate, too.


23
0:1:11,97 --> 0:1:15,17
And we would just skate all
day and night, have some


24
0:1:15,17 --> 0:1:18,2
beers, go to bed, skate, and
that's all there was.


25
0:1:18,2 --> 0:1:43,708



26
0:1:43,708 --> 0:1:44,958
BRIAN WENNING: Where is it at?


27
0:1:44,958 --> 0:1:49,17



28
0:1:49,17 --> 0:1:51,16
[LAUGHTER]


29
0:1:51,16 --> 0:1:53,47
ROB PLUHOWSKI: Philadelphia was
a great fit for anybody.


30
0:1:53,47 --> 0:1:57,4
You know, there was love
at the prime time.


31
0:1:57,4 --> 0:2:0,26
It was, like, everyone would
skate in the park all day.


32
0:2:0,26 --> 0:2:1,52
It was just love all day--


33
0:2:1,52 --> 0:2:3,12
City Hall, love City Hall.


34
0:2:3,12 --> 0:2:6,742
I mean, those guys definitely
put it more on the map, you


35
0:2:6,742 --> 0:2:10,93
know, with the Habitat video,
and the Workshop video.


36
0:2:10,93 --> 0:2:13,7
It came down to, just, turning
things around for everyone,


37
0:2:13,7 --> 0:2:15,145
you know, skateboard-wise.


38
0:2:15,145 --> 0:2:18,36
And they really opened people's
eyes to who they were


39
0:2:18,36 --> 0:2:19,7
really fast.


40
0:2:19,7 --> 0:2:21,167
You know, when those guys first
came down, it was nose


41
0:2:21,167 --> 0:2:22,5
grind pop out era.


42
0:2:22,5 --> 0:2:23,57
You know, everything
was nosegrind


43
0:2:23,57 --> 0:2:25,42
pop out at the ledge.


44
0:2:25,42 --> 0:2:26,5
And they just do it all.


45
0:2:26,5 --> 0:2:27,96
They could just-- and, fuck,
none of us could even


46
0:2:27,96 --> 0:2:31,47
nosegrind the Love ledges,
you know, besides Kalis.


47
0:2:31,47 --> 0:2:34,1
And those guys just come down
there and just blew everyone's


48
0:2:34,1 --> 0:2:35,306
minds away.


49
0:2:35,306 --> 0:2:38,15
I mean, Wenning was doing shit
on ledges that he couldn't


50
0:2:38,15 --> 0:2:38,945
even, like, fathom.


51
0:2:38,945 --> 0:2:40,99
You know, it was amazing.


52
0:2:40,99 --> 0:2:42,51
I would say Wenning,
more first.


53
0:2:42,51 --> 0:2:44,33
But Anthony was kind of--


54
0:2:44,33 --> 0:2:46,474
Anthony came up real fast,
you know what I mean.


55
0:2:46,474 --> 0:2:57,41



56
0:2:57,41 --> 0:2:59,41
They weren't much alike,
that's for sure.


57
0:2:59,41 --> 0:3:0,84
I mean, Wenning was, like--


58
0:3:0,84 --> 0:3:3,4
Wenning always wanted the
attention, You know, he was,


59
0:3:3,4 --> 0:3:7,27
like, doing stupid shit to get
people to look at him.


60
0:3:7,27 --> 0:3:11,32
And then, you know, Anthony
would just be skating.


61
0:3:11,32 --> 0:3:12,33
ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: You know,
I look at my skating when I


62
0:3:12,33 --> 0:3:13,85
was 15 or 16, now.


63
0:3:13,85 --> 0:3:18,76
I don't regret a lot of the
stuff I did, but it's just,


64
0:3:18,76 --> 0:3:19,99
definitely, you change.


65
0:3:19,99 --> 0:3:21,68
I hope you would change.


66
0:3:21,68 --> 0:3:24,95
I hope everyone would change
from when they're 15, 16 years


67
0:3:24,95 --> 0:3:28,8
old, otherwise, it would be
a fucked up place, man.


68
0:3:28,8 --> 0:3:32,49
But I don't have the fucking
mentals to do a lot of the


69
0:3:32,49 --> 0:3:35,4
skating I used to
do back then.


70
0:3:35,4 --> 0:3:38,7



71
0:3:38,7 --> 0:3:39,32
MALE SPEAKER 1: Oh, oh.


72
0:3:39,32 --> 0:3:42,509



73
0:3:42,509 --> 0:3:44,0
ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: Did
I almost do it?


74
0:3:44,0 --> 0:3:45,474
MALE SPEAKER 1: You all right?


75
0:3:45,474 --> 0:3:47,21
ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: Yeah,
let me see it.


76
0:3:47,21 --> 0:3:49,88
ROB PLUHOWSKI: I would say the
one that stands out in my


77
0:3:49,88 --> 0:3:52,7
mind, right now--


78
0:3:52,7 --> 0:3:55,6
that was the switch ollie into
the fountain, for sure.


79
0:3:55,6 --> 0:3:56,66
They had never even ollied it.


80
0:3:56,66 --> 0:3:58,91
You know what I mean, they
didn't even try to ollie it,


81
0:3:58,91 --> 0:4:0,24
ever, just straight
to switch ollie.


82
0:4:0,24 --> 0:4:2,338
That blows my mind away.


83
0:4:2,338 --> 0:4:4,84
MALE SPEAKER 1: Ugh.


84
0:4:4,84 --> 0:4:5,58
ROB PLUHOWSKI: He,
just, did it.


85
0:4:5,58 --> 0:4:6,62
I mean, he got broke.


86
0:4:6,62 --> 0:4:7,275
He got beat up.


87
0:4:7,275 --> 0:4:9,51
I mean, I was scared
for him, sometimes.


88
0:4:9,51 --> 0:4:11,64
Yeah, like, switch ollie into
the fountain at night, what


89
0:4:11,64 --> 0:4:14,431
the hell are you thinking?


90
0:4:14,431 --> 0:4:14,918
AUDIENCE: Woo!


91
0:4:14,918 --> 0:4:20,275
[CHEERS]


92
0:4:20,275 --> 0:4:23,21
AUDIENCE: Whoa!


93
0:4:23,21 --> 0:4:23,78
BRIAN WENNING: I don't know.


94
0:4:23,78 --> 0:4:26,42
Hanging with PJ Ladd in
California, sometimes, it


95
0:4:26,42 --> 0:4:28,372
gives me the feeling
that hanging with


96
0:4:28,372 --> 0:4:29,845
Anthony back then.


97
0:4:29,845 --> 0:4:32,791



98
0:4:32,791 --> 0:4:37,701
AUDIENCE: [CHEERS]


99
0:4:37,701 --> 0:4:39,174
BRIAN WENNING: That's why
we were in competition.


100
0:4:39,174 --> 0:4:41,138
It would help both of us.


101
0:4:41,138 --> 0:4:43,102
AUDIENCE: Oh!


102
0:4:43,102 --> 0:4:44,575
BRIAN WENNING: I don't know
if he just forgot


103
0:4:44,575 --> 0:4:46,6
about himself or what.


104
0:4:46,6 --> 0:4:48,83
I mean, I still skate
the same exact shit.


105
0:4:48,83 --> 0:4:54,198
But maybe he thought it
was time to move on.


106
0:4:54,198 --> 0:4:55,677
AUDIENCE: Yeah.


107
0:4:55,677 --> 0:4:57,876
BRIAN WENNING: That was the time
when, like, he'd be at


108
0:4:57,876 --> 0:5:2,738
the spot at Love Park, and
we wouldn't even talk.


109
0:5:2,738 --> 0:5:7,76



110
0:5:7,76 --> 0:5:8,4
[CHEERING]


111
0:5:8,4 --> 0:5:10,45
MALE SPEAKER 2: But you
switch 180'd it.


112
0:5:10,45 --> 0:5:11,414
BRIAN WENNING: Oh, yeah.


113
0:5:11,414 --> 0:5:12,88
MALE SPEAKER 2: Did you have
it in mind that, OK, he


114
0:5:12,88 --> 0:5:13,29
switch ollied it?


115
0:5:13,29 --> 0:5:13,78
BRIAN WENNING: I don't know.


116
0:5:13,78 --> 0:5:15,77
Somebody was telling me, in the
background, like, when I--


117
0:5:15,77 --> 0:5:16,85
because he did it, like,
a week before.


118
0:5:16,85 --> 0:5:21,2
Then I, like how, that Vern
Larid character likes to say


119
0:5:21,2 --> 0:5:22,25
it on video--


120
0:5:22,25 --> 0:5:23,786
"oh, that was before Brian did


121
0:5:23,786 --> 0:5:25,1
switchbacks." I went hey, whatever.


122
0:5:25,1 --> 0:5:26,16
So I landed that.


123
0:5:26,16 --> 0:5:28,55
I got a cheesesteak, and like,
everybody went crazy.


124
0:5:28,55 --> 0:5:30,365
And then you look over, and
Anthony's, like, trying to do


125
0:5:30,365 --> 0:5:32,448
a nollie tre-flip no spin or
nollie flipout no spin or


126
0:5:32,448 --> 0:5:33,798
nollie flipout, or something
to make [INAUDIBLE]


127
0:5:33,798 --> 0:5:36,208
But yeah, I don't--
we just separated.


128
0:5:36,208 --> 0:5:36,69
That was it.


129
0:5:36,69 --> 0:5:37,654
That was, like, the breaking--


130
0:5:37,654 --> 0:5:41,3
That was, just ridiculous.


131
0:5:41,3 --> 0:5:42,983
He claims-- there was something
in some magazine--


132
0:5:42,983 --> 0:5:46,4
I remember, that we only had
skateboarding in common, but.


133
0:5:46,4 --> 0:5:49,33
It's probably true,
but whatever.


134
0:5:49,33 --> 0:5:50,28
ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: Yeah,
I don't know, man.


135
0:5:50,28 --> 0:5:52,16
I think we just, kind
of, grew apart.


136
0:5:52,16 --> 0:5:54,68
Like, you know, when you're
young, something like


137
0:5:54,68 --> 0:5:56,11
skateboarding could just--


138
0:5:56,11 --> 0:5:58,5
you know, you just have that
little thing that two people


139
0:5:58,5 --> 0:6:1,14
do, and that you guys could just
grow and be, like, the


140
0:6:1,14 --> 0:6:3,8
sickest friends, ever.


141
0:6:3,8 --> 0:6:4,36
And it's just skateboarding,
you know.


142
0:6:4,36 --> 0:6:6,42
But as you get older, it's,
like, you kind of get involved


143
0:6:6,42 --> 0:6:7,79
in other stuff--


144
0:6:7,79 --> 0:6:9,4
good, bad--


145
0:6:9,4 --> 0:6:11,49
it doesn't even have to be,
like, other, you know.


146
0:6:11,49 --> 0:6:14,114
And I think that's just, kind
of, what happened with us.


147
0:6:14,114 --> 0:6:17,495
You know, I think at a point,
all's we did have was skating.


148
0:6:17,495 --> 0:6:20,25



149
0:6:20,25 --> 0:6:21,21
BRIAN WENNING: I don't know.


150
0:6:21,21 --> 0:6:23,62
I don't know.


151
0:6:23,62 --> 0:6:29,785
I could talk to him, now,
like, man to man, easy.


152
0:6:29,785 --> 0:6:31,765
ANTHONY PAPPALARDO:
Is that swollen?


153
0:6:31,765 --> 0:6:33,15
MALE SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE].


154
0:6:33,15 --> 0:6:38,2



155
0:6:38,2 --> 0:6:39,731
BILL STROBECK: Everyone regrets
shit they do when


156
0:6:39,731 --> 0:6:40,59
they're 16, you know.


157
0:6:40,59 --> 0:6:42,205
He had, like, huge gear.


158
0:6:42,205 --> 0:6:43,88
He was, like--


159
0:6:43,88 --> 0:6:45,7
he looks totally different,
you know what I mean.


160
0:6:45,7 --> 0:6:46,67
He grew out of that.


161
0:6:46,67 --> 0:6:51,25
He was, like hip hop-- like,
he looked funny.


162
0:6:51,25 --> 0:6:52,627
I mean, we all looked
funny back then.


163
0:6:52,627 --> 0:6:53,85
We were young, you know.


164
0:6:53,85 --> 0:6:57,53
He skated very conventionally,
then, you know what I mean I


165
0:6:57,53 --> 0:7:0,81
think he was, like, doing what
he thought other people


166
0:7:0,81 --> 0:7:2,558
wanted him to do.


167
0:7:2,558 --> 0:7:6,9
I think that now he kind of does
what he wants, and that's


168
0:7:6,9 --> 0:7:7,79
what makes him happy.


169
0:7:7,79 --> 0:7:9,366
And I think that's fine.


170
0:7:9,366 --> 0:7:12,81



171
0:7:12,81 --> 0:7:14,46
MALE SPEAKER 2: By the time he
got to Mosaic, do you think he


172
0:7:14,46 --> 0:7:17,365
was a different person than he
was from Photosynthesis?


173
0:7:17,365 --> 0:7:18,282
BILL STROBECK: I feel
like around the end


174
0:7:18,282 --> 0:7:20,26
of Mosaic, he was.


175
0:7:20,26 --> 0:7:22,29
But people change every,
like, 10 minutes.


176
0:7:22,29 --> 0:7:25,17
Like 10 minutes ago, I was in
my sweatpants in that bed,


177
0:7:25,17 --> 0:7:26,4
right there, you know
what I mean.


178
0:7:26,4 --> 0:7:27,13
He was, definitely, changing.


179
0:7:27,13 --> 0:7:32,1
I mean, those years from like 16
to 24, people change, like,


180
0:7:32,1 --> 0:7:34,31
significantly.


181
0:7:34,31 --> 0:7:35,2
You're a kid.


182
0:7:35,2 --> 0:7:35,82
You don't know what
you're doing.


183
0:7:35,82 --> 0:7:37,54
You're trying things to
see what you like,


184
0:7:37,54 --> 0:7:38,52
you know what I mean.


185
0:7:38,52 --> 0:7:40,94
And then, eventually, down the
line, you know what you like.


186
0:7:40,94 --> 0:7:46,76



187
0:7:46,76 --> 0:7:48,1
AUDIENCE: Whoa!


188
0:7:48,1 --> 0:7:50,16



189
0:7:50,16 --> 0:7:51,39
BILL STROBECK: All his
friends that skated


190
0:7:51,39 --> 0:7:52,87
don't skate no more.


191
0:7:52,87 --> 0:7:57,35
He skated with Rob Pluhowski,
who has two kids and works in


192
0:7:57,35 --> 0:8:1,901
fucking sanding wood all day.


193
0:8:1,901 --> 0:8:3,85
What's up, Rob?


194
0:8:3,85 --> 0:8:4,59
I love Rob.


195
0:8:4,59 --> 0:8:6,14
Rob is one of my best
friends, man.


196
0:8:6,14 --> 0:8:8,33
I haven't seen him in
a long time but--


197
0:8:8,33 --> 0:8:9,42
we were real--


198
0:8:9,42 --> 0:8:10,81
us three were real close.


199
0:8:10,81 --> 0:8:12,25
Like, we were, like--
hang everyday.


200
0:8:12,25 --> 0:8:17,55



201
0:8:17,55 --> 0:8:19,38
MALE SPEAKER 1: Come on, Papp.


202
0:8:19,38 --> 0:8:20,288
Get off of this.


203
0:8:20,288 --> 0:8:24,445



204
0:8:24,445 --> 0:8:25,53
ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: You
know, they were


205
0:8:25,53 --> 0:8:26,96
just my friends growing--


206
0:8:26,96 --> 0:8:29,246
like, since 15 on.


207
0:8:29,246 --> 0:8:31,59
You know, in skating or outside
of skating, we could,


208
0:8:31,59 --> 0:8:34,95
like, we could have a cup of
coffee and have a chat or


209
0:8:34,95 --> 0:8:39,9
something, talk about
normal shit.


210
0:8:39,9 --> 0:8:41,63
Rob always had a good
attitude of kind of


211
0:8:41,63 --> 0:8:43,51
knowing this isn't--


212
0:8:43,51 --> 0:8:45,34
and kind of trained
me, where--


213
0:8:45,34 --> 0:8:47,88
I think it's a good mentality,
where people take this skating


214
0:8:47,88 --> 0:8:49,56
thing too serious.


215
0:8:49,56 --> 0:8:53,86
And it's, like, you're not a
fucking rock star, and like,


216
0:8:53,86 --> 0:8:57,11
just, skaters have a problem
being, like, a realist, and


217
0:8:57,11 --> 0:8:59,5
just, you know, it's
going to end.


218
0:8:59,5 --> 0:9:1,227
And Rob always had a good level
head of, like, well this


219
0:9:1,227 --> 0:9:2,7
isn't going to last forever.


220
0:9:2,7 --> 0:9:6,36
So while we have off time, and
we're getting paid to do


221
0:9:6,36 --> 0:9:8,1
nothing, you know, let's go to
Cook-- like, let's go do


222
0:9:8,1 --> 0:9:10,3
something, and go on a road
trip or something.


223
0:9:10,3 --> 0:9:11,18
And it was always fun.


224
0:9:11,18 --> 0:9:12,73
It was cool.


225
0:9:12,73 --> 0:9:13,95
ROB PLUHOWSKI: Philly
was dead.


226
0:9:13,95 --> 0:9:15,79
It was just--


227
0:9:15,79 --> 0:9:16,77
It wasn't--


228
0:9:16,77 --> 0:9:18,75
there was-- it was just dead.


229
0:9:18,75 --> 0:9:21,36
I felt like I needed a
change in my life.


230
0:9:21,36 --> 0:9:23,76
So I always wanted to
live in New York.


231
0:9:23,76 --> 0:9:25,65
And Anthony was--


232
0:9:25,65 --> 0:9:26,255
he's always--


233
0:9:26,255 --> 0:9:27,94
You know, he's from
Long Island.


234
0:9:27,94 --> 0:9:29,48
He came up there with me.


235
0:9:29,48 --> 0:9:30,38
We got an apartment together.


236
0:9:30,38 --> 0:9:31,23
We lived together.


237
0:9:31,23 --> 0:9:34,24
It was great That was a
good year of my life,


238
0:9:34,24 --> 0:9:36,22
living on 1st and 10th.


239
0:9:36,22 --> 0:9:38,897
And then things started
to change, and,


240
0:9:38,897 --> 0:9:40,38
like, I had a kid.


241
0:9:40,38 --> 0:9:42,59
And I had to do what
I had to do here.


242
0:9:42,59 --> 0:9:45,8
And then I got kicked
off of Habitat.


243
0:9:45,8 --> 0:9:47,86
You know, then I started to
realize that skateboarding


244
0:9:47,86 --> 0:9:50,41
wasn't for me, you know,
in the long run.


245
0:9:50,41 --> 0:9:52,19
I would skate with them
everyday, kind of.


246
0:9:52,19 --> 0:9:55,58
You know, I think when I left,
it was, kind of, like a last


247
0:9:55,58 --> 0:9:57,34
friend on the team, you know.


248
0:9:57,34 --> 0:9:59,28
It's like, Anthony is a really
down to earth guy, you know


249
0:9:59,28 --> 0:9:59,63
what I mean.


250
0:9:59,63 --> 0:10:2,2
He's like, there's
no ego involved.


251
0:10:2,2 --> 0:10:3,93
There's no, like--


252
0:10:3,93 --> 0:10:6,222
He just wants to go skateboard
and have a good time, you know


253
0:10:6,222 --> 0:10:7,39
what I mean.


254
0:10:7,39 --> 0:10:8,98
He, just, enjoys his
time, there.


255
0:10:8,98 --> 0:10:13,77
And you get in a van and you go
on a trip, and within five


256
0:10:13,77 --> 0:10:16,52
minutes, like, dudes, they
won't stop talking about


257
0:10:16,52 --> 0:10:18,15
themselves.


258
0:10:18,15 --> 0:10:20,34
ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: Hey man,
it's a great company.


259
0:10:20,34 --> 0:10:23,62
It's, like, at one time, I
think, when I first got on


260
0:10:23,62 --> 0:10:28,34
Alien, it was heavily East
Coast and had all those


261
0:10:28,34 --> 0:10:32,65
influences and those people
behind it and style and ideas


262
0:10:32,65 --> 0:10:33,51
and aesthetics.


263
0:10:33,51 --> 0:10:36,57
And I think that did die
out, you know, and


264
0:10:36,57 --> 0:10:37,84
I don't think it's--


265
0:10:37,84 --> 0:10:39,46
And I don't know who to
say if that's a good


266
0:10:39,46 --> 0:10:40,38
thing or a bad thing.


267
0:10:40,38 --> 0:10:43,19
It just, that's what makes
it just skating.


268
0:10:43,19 --> 0:10:44,57
And It's just--


269
0:10:44,57 --> 0:10:47,54
I'm sure there's tons of kids,
you know, in California, that


270
0:10:47,54 --> 0:10:50,215
love Alien now, that
didn't like it, you


271
0:10:50,215 --> 0:10:51,6
know, when it was more.


272
0:10:51,6 --> 0:10:54,49
So it's just, like, who's to say
that it was better then,


273
0:10:54,49 --> 0:11:0,92
but I think it was more of an
East Coast vibe, at a point,


274
0:11:0,92 --> 0:11:2,99
like one of those older
types of teams-- like


275
0:11:2,99 --> 0:11:4,135
Rick and those dudes.


276
0:11:4,135 --> 0:11:6,79
You know, you'll catch them
all skating together in


277
0:11:6,79 --> 0:11:9,1
California.


278
0:11:9,1 --> 0:11:9,47
BILL STROBECK: I feel like--


279
0:11:9,47 --> 0:11:11,84
I mean, dude, he was
Workshop forever.


280
0:11:11,84 --> 0:11:13,805
I mean, he had the tattoo.


281
0:11:13,805 --> 0:11:15,49
He had a Workshop tattoo,
you know.


282
0:11:15,49 --> 0:11:16,95
I don't even know if
he still has it.


283
0:11:16,95 --> 0:11:18,2
I think he does.


284
0:11:18,2 --> 0:11:19,84
It's right on his wrist, but--


285
0:11:19,84 --> 0:11:22,33
And then, you know, Alien
changed, but like, it was like


286
0:11:22,33 --> 0:11:23,3
that, dude.


287
0:11:23,3 --> 0:11:25,62
It was, like, then all these
new dudes got on.


288
0:11:25,62 --> 0:11:28,15
Anthony got in Chocolate
right after that.


289
0:11:28,15 --> 0:11:30,54
It was like, seriously, like,
I feel like a couple months


290
0:11:30,54 --> 0:11:32,92
after that, he was just, like,
you know, I'm on Chocolate.


291
0:11:32,92 --> 0:11:33,592
ROB PLUHOWSKI: I don't know.


292
0:11:33,592 --> 0:11:36,1
You know, Anthony just wanted
to be with dudes


293
0:11:36,1 --> 0:11:37,385
that kind of, like--


294
0:11:37,385 --> 0:11:39,54
you know, like Mike Carroll,
Rick Howard.


295
0:11:39,54 --> 0:11:41,16
You know, they went out and
skated and had a good time,


296
0:11:41,16 --> 0:11:41,9
came home--


297
0:11:41,9 --> 0:11:44,52
like, did their own thing, had,
like, a little family


298
0:11:44,52 --> 0:11:45,71
feeling thing going on.


299
0:11:45,71 --> 0:11:49,25
But at Workshop at that time, it
was kind of like, everyone


300
0:11:49,25 --> 0:11:51,17
was out to be number one.


301
0:11:51,17 --> 0:11:53,55
He was, like, you know, I just
need something changed,


302
0:11:53,55 --> 0:11:54,47
something more me.


303
0:11:54,47 --> 0:11:55,8
You know what I mean?


304
0:11:55,8 --> 0:11:58,1
Something more--


305
0:11:58,1 --> 0:12:0,24
more, his style.


306
0:12:0,24 --> 0:12:1,5
ANTHONY PAPPALARDO:
So this is it.


307
0:12:1,5 --> 0:12:3,58
You guys made it over here.


308
0:12:3,58 --> 0:12:6,46
No one's really seen it to
this level in a while.


309
0:12:6,46 --> 0:12:8,92
Everyone, kind of, when I first
got it, people came over


310
0:12:8,92 --> 0:12:11,34
here and were, like, what are
you going to do in this


311
0:12:11,34 --> 0:12:14,28
dungeon, just be by yourself
like you always do?


312
0:12:14,28 --> 0:12:17,54
And it's just like-- no, no,
like, I'm going to fix it up


313
0:12:17,54 --> 0:12:21,728
and do what I want to do
and, like, make stuff.


314
0:12:21,728 --> 0:12:30,63
[SAW RUNNING]


315
0:12:30,63 --> 0:12:31,61
ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: This
stuff's beautiful.


316
0:12:31,61 --> 0:12:34,1
It looks like a painting,
almost, you know.


317
0:12:34,1 --> 0:12:36,1
But it's just like skating-- you
know, you just get older.


318
0:12:36,1 --> 0:12:38,3
And it's like skating can--


319
0:12:38,3 --> 0:12:40,82
you want it to, but physically,
your body doesn't


320
0:12:40,82 --> 0:12:43,67
let you do what you
want to be doing.


321
0:12:43,67 --> 0:12:46,12
And it could frustrate you, and
you could put that energy


322
0:12:46,12 --> 0:12:50,32
into something totally negative,
which is sad.


323
0:12:50,32 --> 0:12:56,3
I think a lot of people in
the skateboard world do.


324
0:12:56,3 --> 0:12:57,65
Or you could try to
do something.


325
0:12:57,65 --> 0:12:58,61
I don't know what's cooler.


326
0:12:58,61 --> 0:13:0,39
I don't know, you could
try to make something,


327
0:13:0,39 --> 0:13:4,12
and do other stuff.


328
0:13:4,12 --> 0:13:5,59
That's pretty much
what this is.


329
0:13:5,59 --> 0:13:12,9



330
0:13:12,9 --> 0:13:16,73
Yeah, I mean, woodworking and
just trying to make stuff--


331
0:13:16,73 --> 0:13:19,63
you know, if this is what I'm
going to be doing for the next


332
0:13:19,63 --> 0:13:20,825
50 years, I don't know.


333
0:13:20,825 --> 0:13:22,26
You know, it's keeping
me busy, now.


334
0:13:22,26 --> 0:13:24,806
I really enjoy doing it.


335
0:13:24,806 --> 0:13:28,42
And like I said, it's, like,
East Coast Pro, it's like, I


336
0:13:28,42 --> 0:13:29,5
mean, you see it.


337
0:13:29,5 --> 0:13:32,55
It's a lot of downtime,
not skating.


338
0:13:32,55 --> 0:13:35,5
You know, you piss away
a lot of free time.


339
0:13:35,5 --> 0:13:38,66
And I think I just hit a point
where that free time was


340
0:13:38,66 --> 0:13:39,11
killing me.


341
0:13:39,11 --> 0:13:41,51
I couldn't do it anymore.


342
0:13:41,51 --> 0:13:46,17
I needed a place or something
to make myself feel like I'm


343
0:13:46,17 --> 0:13:50,79
doing something productive when
I'm not skating, instead


344
0:13:50,79 --> 0:13:54,27
of, you know, sitting at
the bar or something


345
0:13:54,27 --> 0:13:57,23
or watching TV or--


346
0:13:57,23 --> 0:14:1,0
which I, you know,
no hard feelings.


347
0:14:1,0 --> 0:14:3,79
You know, to each their own, but
I just know, as a personal


348
0:14:3,79 --> 0:14:8,25
thing, where I was at a year
or two ago, I just needed


349
0:14:8,25 --> 0:14:11,64
something more than just numbing
myself out when I was


350
0:14:11,64 --> 0:14:13,5
done skating.


351
0:14:13,5 --> 0:14:16,37
You just have to
keep it going.


352
0:14:16,37 --> 0:14:19,68
TED BARROW: I guess I met
Pappalardo in late 2003, when


353
0:14:19,68 --> 0:14:21,2
he moved to New York.


354
0:14:21,2 --> 0:14:24,8
I don't know, you know, like, on
one hand, like, you sort of


355
0:14:24,8 --> 0:14:24,97
have a preconceived idea.


356
0:14:24,97 --> 0:14:27,39
You know, like, you think about
dudes that skate for


357
0:14:27,39 --> 0:14:31,5
Alien, and you think of, like,
Van Englen and fucking Kalis


358
0:14:31,5 --> 0:14:32,33
and people like that.


359
0:14:32,33 --> 0:14:33,61
And they're, like, sort
of intimidating.


360
0:14:33,61 --> 0:14:36,81
So you've got to think like a
kid from the East Coast that


361
0:14:36,81 --> 0:14:38,71
came up skating in Philly,
essentially.


362
0:14:38,71 --> 0:14:41,66
Like you know when you see his
first couple parts, like, he


363
0:14:41,66 --> 0:14:42,76
might be kind of a dick.


364
0:14:42,76 --> 0:14:45,508
He definitely was a lot more
down to earth, it comes to


365
0:14:45,508 --> 0:14:47,75
meeting him, you know.


366
0:14:47,75 --> 0:14:49,69
I mean, every interview where
people are talking about the


367
0:14:49,69 --> 0:14:52,23
Lakai video, they're like, oh,
there's such this, like, big,


368
0:14:52,23 --> 0:14:53,26
long expectation.


369
0:14:53,26 --> 0:14:55,81
Everyone's hopes are so high,
like, blah blah blah.


370
0:14:55,81 --> 0:14:58,99
Like, I'm sure he doesn't
respond to that at all.


371
0:14:58,99 --> 0:15:2,15
Like that's the last thing
he wants to think about.


372
0:15:2,15 --> 0:15:5,6
And so like, probably
woodworking or whatever he's


373
0:15:5,6 --> 0:15:7,39
doing off the board is probably,
like, in some ways


374
0:15:7,39 --> 0:15:8,98
therapeutic, or it's just,
kind of, keeping him


375
0:15:8,98 --> 0:15:11,99
grounded, you know.


376
0:15:11,99 --> 0:15:13,145
BILL STROBECK: Anthony's
just like, not--


377
0:15:13,145 --> 0:15:15,1
I feel like he's just not
gung ho about it.


378
0:15:15,1 --> 0:15:17,84
Like I don't feel like he,
like, wakes up and, like,


379
0:15:17,84 --> 0:15:23,91
"fuck, dude, I got to, like, go
out and backslide 360 flip


380
0:15:23,91 --> 0:15:28,95
tailslide on this ledge, right
now." Like I think he does


381
0:15:28,95 --> 0:15:32,82
what he thinks looks
good, and it's not


382
0:15:32,82 --> 0:15:35,27
about impressing anyone.


383
0:15:35,27 --> 0:15:37,7
It's not about impressing
anyone at all.


384
0:15:37,7 --> 0:15:40,92
It's kind of just being
true to yourself.


385
0:15:40,92 --> 0:15:45,702



386
0:15:45,702 --> 0:15:46,658
AUDIENCE: Woo!


387
0:15:46,658 --> 0:15:47,85
ROB PLUHOWSKI: Yeah,
he doesn't--


388
0:15:47,85 --> 0:15:49,85
he's definitely not a spotlight
person, you know.


389
0:15:49,85 --> 0:15:52,176
He doesn't really--


390
0:15:52,176 --> 0:15:54,41
yeah, it, definitely, frustrates
him, for sure.


391
0:15:54,41 --> 0:15:57,51
You know, he doesn't like people
caring or even wanting


392
0:15:57,51 --> 0:15:58,76
to care about what he's up to.


393
0:15:58,76 --> 0:16:4,99



394
0:16:4,99 --> 0:16:5,63
He's just to himself,
you know.


395
0:16:5,63 --> 0:16:7,91
He's just a normal person,
who just--


396
0:16:7,91 --> 0:16:8,77
he's good at skateboarding.


397
0:16:8,77 --> 0:16:10,37
And people might say, hey, you
know, what's Anthony doing,


398
0:16:10,37 --> 0:16:11,282
what's he up to?


399
0:16:11,282 --> 0:16:13,72
Like, he's out skateboarding
in Brooklyn somewhere.


400
0:16:13,72 --> 0:16:14,5
You know what I mean?


401
0:16:14,5 --> 0:16:15,5
Maybe he's by himself.


402
0:16:15,5 --> 0:16:18,15
Maybe he's with Bill, you
know, I don't know.


403
0:16:18,15 --> 0:16:26,952



404
0:16:26,952 --> 0:16:28,908
MALE SPEAKER 1: Is that
asphalt all right?


405
0:16:28,908 --> 0:16:36,19



406
0:16:36,19 --> 0:16:38,31
TED BARROW: I had to go to
Williamsburg early in the


407
0:16:38,31 --> 0:16:40,98
morning on a fucking Sunday,
8:00 in the morning.


408
0:16:40,98 --> 0:16:46,1
I rode my bike over the bridge,
and I get a text from


409
0:16:46,1 --> 0:16:47,72
Pappalardo, like 15
minutes later.


410
0:16:47,72 --> 0:16:49,685
And he's, like, riding
your bike over the


411
0:16:49,685 --> 0:16:51,43
Williamsburg Bridge?


412
0:16:51,43 --> 0:16:52,7
And I was, like, what
are you doing up?


413
0:16:52,7 --> 0:16:55,55
And he's like, "killing it."
Like, where the fuck was he?


414
0:16:55,55 --> 0:16:58,29
Like, I don't-- you know, what
was he doing at 8:00 the


415
0:16:58,29 --> 0:16:59,54
morning on a Sunday?


416
0:16:59,54 --> 0:17:9,69



417
0:17:9,69 --> 0:17:12,55
TY EVANS: Like, the root of
skateboarding has, and always


418
0:17:12,55 --> 0:17:14,43
will be, fun.


419
0:17:14,43 --> 0:17:17,7
And making skate videos, you
definitely have to put in


420
0:17:17,7 --> 0:17:20,4
work, and it takes the
fun aspect out of it.


421
0:17:20,4 --> 0:17:22,25
You know, we've got to go
[INAUDIBLE] this, we've got to


422
0:17:22,25 --> 0:17:22,93
go write this up.


423
0:17:22,93 --> 0:17:23,589
We've got to go here.


424
0:17:23,589 --> 0:17:24,78
We've got to do that.


425
0:17:24,78 --> 0:17:27,823
And skating's not like that.


426
0:17:27,823 --> 0:17:32,88
You know, skating's like, what
Pappalardo's part's about.


427
0:17:32,88 --> 0:17:34,56
It is about going out
your door and


428
0:17:34,56 --> 0:17:36,482
skating down the street.


429
0:17:36,482 --> 0:17:39,78
I don't think you'd ever see
Papps skating like one of


430
0:17:39,78 --> 0:17:41,79
those makeshift jump ramp
ledges, or something.


431
0:17:41,79 --> 0:17:42,65
You know what I mean.


432
0:17:42,65 --> 0:17:45,7
It's like, he skates, like, true
stuff that you would find


433
0:17:45,7 --> 0:17:46,32
just lurking around.


434
0:17:46,32 --> 0:17:59,26



435
0:17:59,26 --> 0:18:2,62
Out of all the parts in the
video, look at Papps' part,


436
0:18:2,62 --> 0:18:5,472
and it's the most
true to skating.


437
0:18:5,472 --> 0:18:9,15
It's the less contrived part out
of everything, you know.


438
0:18:9,15 --> 0:18:12,78
And that's what makes Papps'
part stand out, you know,


439
0:18:12,78 --> 0:18:15,55
aside from the fact that it's
all on the East Coast.


440
0:18:15,55 --> 0:18:19,1
You know, that's the totally
raw, pure form of skating.


441
0:18:19,1 --> 0:18:21,9
That's, basically, the
equivalent of jumping out of


442
0:18:21,9 --> 0:18:23,284
your front door and
skating something.


443
0:18:23,284 --> 0:18:36,46



444
0:18:36,46 --> 0:18:39,11
MALE SPEAKER 2: Do you think,
like, the vibe of Fully


445
0:18:39,11 --> 0:18:41,82
Flaired or the vibe of, like,
the rest of the team had


446
0:18:41,82 --> 0:18:44,35
anything to do with him not
skating for Lakai anymore


447
0:18:44,35 --> 0:18:46,6
after that?


448
0:18:46,6 --> 0:18:48,7
TY EVANS: No.


449
0:18:48,7 --> 0:18:51,8
I mean, I don't know if it's
common knowledge, but that was


450
0:18:51,8 --> 0:18:53,95
going on before the video
was even over.


451
0:18:53,95 --> 0:18:56,69
You know, it's like--


452
0:18:56,69 --> 0:19:1,14
I think the one thing about
Lakai is that there's so many


453
0:19:1,14 --> 0:19:4,11
good guys on there, they all
deserve to have shoes and


454
0:19:4,11 --> 0:19:5,94
these great deals.


455
0:19:5,94 --> 0:19:10,17
And I don't care what company
you are, it's like, how do you


456
0:19:10,17 --> 0:19:13,87
support 19 pro shoes?


457
0:19:13,87 --> 0:19:15,72
That's a huge salary.


458
0:19:15,72 --> 0:19:19,62
You've got to be, like, the
swoosh or the three stripes to


459
0:19:19,62 --> 0:19:21,46
support some shit like that.


460
0:19:21,46 --> 0:19:26,0
You know, and I'm sure when
Papps was filming his part, he


461
0:19:26,0 --> 0:19:28,57
knew, like, I'm just going to
get through this Lakai fucking


462
0:19:28,57 --> 0:19:30,57
thing, get through this beast,
and then I'll get on a shoe


463
0:19:30,57 --> 0:19:31,75
company and pay some bills.


464
0:19:31,75 --> 0:19:35,15
Like you know, I think it's
great that someone like Alex


465
0:19:35,15 --> 0:19:37,58
and Papps can go and live
a little bit more


466
0:19:37,58 --> 0:19:39,326
comfortably, you know.


467
0:19:39,326 --> 0:19:42,17
You know It's not affecting
their positions on


468
0:19:42,17 --> 0:19:43,49
Chocolate or Girl.


469
0:19:43,49 --> 0:19:45,16
I think, like, what Federico
was saying, like, you know,


470
0:19:45,16 --> 0:19:47,27
it's pretty cool that, like,
everything just kind of worked


471
0:19:47,27 --> 0:19:47,99
out, you know.


472
0:19:47,99 --> 0:19:49,63
BILL STROBECK: Like, he's
doing all right.


473
0:19:49,63 --> 0:19:51,2
He's doing good.


474
0:19:51,2 --> 0:19:52,6
He's stoked.


475
0:19:52,6 --> 0:19:54,57
And out of everything, I think
leaving Lakai was a


476
0:19:54,57 --> 0:19:56,5
good thing for him.


477
0:19:56,5 --> 0:20:0,1
I think it was like, you know,
Rick and Mike left their,


478
0:20:0,1 --> 0:20:2,33
like, companies, you know, when
they're younger, like, to


479
0:20:2,33 --> 0:20:4,29
try their own things and
to see if they like it.


480
0:20:4,29 --> 0:20:8,782
I mean-- and they seem to be
doing well themselves, so.


481
0:20:8,782 --> 0:20:10,75
Hmm.


482
0:20:10,75 --> 0:20:12,33
He seems to be like
the forefront--


483
0:20:12,33 --> 0:20:15,742
like, he seems to be, like, the
dude at Converse, you know


484
0:20:15,742 --> 0:20:16,32
what I mean.


485
0:20:16,32 --> 0:20:18,91
So that's, like, a good thing,
you know, because he's like,


486
0:20:18,91 --> 0:20:20,91
oh, I want this shoe,
like, I can get it.


487
0:20:20,91 --> 0:20:21,2
You know what I mean?


488
0:20:21,2 --> 0:20:22,95
Like, I can tell them I
want this in suede--


489
0:20:22,95 --> 0:20:24,97
I want this, like,
and it's there.


490
0:20:24,97 --> 0:20:27,39
You know, they're super
down for him.


491
0:20:27,39 --> 0:20:28,94
MALE SPEAKER 2: Is Converse--


492
0:20:28,94 --> 0:20:30,76
they get behind this
kind of stuff?


493
0:20:30,76 --> 0:20:32,16
ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: Yeah,
they were psyched.


494
0:20:32,16 --> 0:20:35,69
They were, like, the initial
people that helped me out with


495
0:20:35,69 --> 0:20:40,95
the space and getting the space
going, and then pushing


496
0:20:40,95 --> 0:20:45,3
me to do some more
of this stuff.


497
0:20:45,3 --> 0:20:49,54
And that's a good feeling
to have, you know.


498
0:20:49,54 --> 0:20:53,43
Not just like, "send me your
footage tape for 30 seconds of


499
0:20:53,43 --> 0:20:53,94
footage."


500
0:20:53,94 --> 0:20:57,51
And you know, they know I'm
skating when I'm skating.


501
0:20:57,51 --> 0:21:0,47
And in here, I'm not trying
to fool anyone, or--


502
0:21:0,47 --> 0:21:2,68
it's a really good
relationship.


503
0:21:2,68 --> 0:21:8,12
And I think some of the first
20, 25 people, like shops and


504
0:21:8,12 --> 0:21:11,36
stuff that kind of order
Converse, and just shops in


505
0:21:11,36 --> 0:21:15,45
general that carry the product
and back it will get, like,


506
0:21:15,45 --> 0:21:16,84
one of these benches
or something.


507
0:21:16,84 --> 0:21:20,41
We're trying to work
something out.


508
0:21:20,41 --> 0:21:23,3
Not like the dudes
at the skate shop


509
0:21:23,3 --> 0:21:26,242
give a shit, but whatever.


510
0:21:26,242 --> 0:21:28,54
If I'm not skating,
I'm in here.


511
0:21:28,54 --> 0:21:34,33
It used to be the bar, so yeah
I'd rather just come here and


512
0:21:34,33 --> 0:21:39,6
just play around, and try
to make something.


513
0:21:39,6 --> 0:21:40,95
Yeah, cocobolo is really
interesting.


514
0:21:40,95 --> 0:21:46,32
This stuff's really cool, like
this spalted maple--


515
0:21:46,32 --> 0:21:49,52
like, I want to do a huge table
of just this stuff.


516
0:21:49,52 --> 0:21:51,43
Yeah, my grandfather gave
me a lot of stuff.


517
0:21:51,43 --> 0:21:54,36
He was an electrician, and he
always did this as, kind of,


518
0:21:54,36 --> 0:21:58,17
like a hobby, as well--
kind of woodworking


519
0:21:58,17 --> 0:22:0,51
and anything craftsman.


520
0:22:0,51 --> 0:22:1,38
He would just--


521
0:22:1,38 --> 0:22:4,24
he, like, built his own
house, type of guy.


522
0:22:4,24 --> 0:22:8,21
So he gave me a lot of his old
stuff to play around with.


523
0:22:8,21 --> 0:22:9,24
And it was actually cool.


524
0:22:9,24 --> 0:22:12,99
He came over here about
a month ago.


525
0:22:12,99 --> 0:22:15,19
And he's, just, like the guy
that you can never get a


526
0:22:15,19 --> 0:22:17,78
reaction out of, and he
was, like, proud.


527
0:22:17,78 --> 0:22:19,3
It was cool.


528
0:22:19,3 --> 0:22:21,46



529
0:22:21,46 --> 0:22:22,71
Stray.


530
0:22:22,71 --> 0:22:24,439



531
0:22:24,439 --> 0:22:25,86
MALE SPEAKER 2: Stray's
the friendliest dog.


532
0:22:25,86 --> 0:22:28,35
ANTHONY PAPPALARDO:
Friendliest dog.


533
0:22:28,35 --> 0:22:30,45
MALE SPEAKER 2: She looks like
Santa's Little Helper, but the


534
0:22:30,45 --> 0:22:31,7
black version.


535
0:22:31,7 --> 0:24:31,7
