1
0:0:44,0 --> 0:0:49,32
I can't always explain my experiences
in relation to the dogmas or doctrines of


2
0:0:49,32 --> 0:0:54,5
every faith, but as bad as some of these
demons are, which they are very, very serious


3
0:0:54,5 --> 0:1:8,0
and they are by far so rabid in this world.
It's almost impossible to even explain.


4
0:1:8,0 --> 0:1:15,31
One night I was given to go over a particular
US city and the entire upper atmosphere was


5
0:1:15,31 --> 0:1:21,25
filled with so many demons it was almost impossible
to get through it... and when I got through


6
0:1:21,25 --> 0:1:26,909
it I was exhausted for like two weeks, and
it was a particular city where there was just


7
0:1:26,909 --> 0:1:34,67
really dominantly dark at that point, and
so we have to recognize that much of what


8
0:1:34,67 --> 0:1:40,0
we believe to be true really isn't. There
is more to what we're doing here than what


9
0:1:40,0 --> 0:1:48,57
we maybe want to deal with.


10
0:1:48,57 --> 0:1:52,75
I believe that this world that we're experiencing is,


11
0:1:52,75 --> 0:2:1,99
to put it kindly, small potatoes. It's like a
little experience that God has given us for our


12
0:2:1,99 --> 0:2:9,25
benefit and edification and our spiritual
development. This is not graduate school by


13
0:2:9,25 --> 0:2:18,0
any means. It's more like nursery school.
When I asked Jesus, 'Is this like elementary


14
0:2:18,0 --> 0:2:22,99
school? He said no. And I said kindergarden?
He goes no. And I said, "Nursery school?"


15
0:2:22,99 --> 0:2:30,0
And He says, "Mmm, like nursery school." The
lessons of this world are avoid evil and love


16
0:2:30,0 --> 0:2:37,0
good, be kind to one another... these are
not really difficult or intellectually challenging


17
0:2:37,0 --> 0:2:42,28
lessons that were learning down here and which
plenty of people are failing to learn.


18
0:2:42,28 --> 0:2:47,34
It's possible that if you are not progressing
properly in this realm that you could go backwards


19
0:2:47,34 --> 0:2:56,28
but that's usually for people who are engaging
in seriously destructive things. Dominantly


20
0:2:56,28 --> 0:3:5,0
dark and evil would be people who are engaging
in murder, rape... serious, serious acts against


21
0:3:5,0 --> 0:3:11,65
life, because the way energy is perceived
in the mystical realms is acts for or against


22
0:3:11,65 --> 0:3:18,54
life. And so to go into the dominantly dark
and evil realms you would have to do some


23
0:3:18,54 --> 0:3:26,0
pretty bad stuff. However, just having the
issues of vanity and lust could put you in


24
0:3:26,0 --> 0:3:30,85
a lower realm.


25
0:3:30,85 --> 0:3:34,319
This is just a small portion
of what I was shown, it's called the universal


26
0:3:34,319 --> 0:3:39,54
sphere of realms. We are in here... this is
the third realm and this is the fourth realm.


27
0:3:39,54 --> 0:3:45,739
This fourth realm is the astral plane. This
third realm would be a third dimensional reality


28
0:3:45,739 --> 0:3:50,72
which we reside on. In the very center is
the first realm which, as you can see, is


29
0:3:50,72 --> 0:3:55,75
totally black - that's total darkness, that's
where pure evil resides. The second realm


30
0:3:55,75 --> 0:4:0,379
is where dominant darkness resides. When you're
dealing with realms one and two, you're dealing


31
0:4:0,379 --> 0:4:6,349
with purgatories and hell realms - both of
these are even lower realms than we are. And


32
0:4:6,349 --> 0:4:10,269
when you're dealing with three and four you're
dealing with purgatories and people who are


33
0:4:10,269 --> 0:4:16,239
trying to reach beyond into realms five and
above, which go out into higher and higher


34
0:4:16,239 --> 0:4:21,37
gradations of light. But these four realms
together make up what is called the border


35
0:4:21,37 --> 0:4:27,59
worlds - the underworlds - and so the reason
why this is important is because if you understand


36
0:4:27,59 --> 0:4:33,52
this is where we are... and God is somewhere
way out there, than what I'm going to try


37
0:4:33,52 --> 0:4:37,0
to describe and explain makes a lot more sense.


38
0:4:37,0 --> 0:4:39,36
When we die, we human beings have no power


39
0:4:39,36 --> 0:4:52,0
to ascend or descend spiritually. We are taken
by guides... who could be either angels or


40
0:4:52,0 --> 0:5:1,0
demons... to what we carry in our hearts. If
we carry hate in our hearts we go to a world of


41
0:5:1,0 --> 0:5:6,8
hate, and if we carry love in our hearts
we're carried to world of love.


42
0:5:6,8 --> 0:5:12,25
It's not good enough just to be nice, to speak
nicely and have a seething mind filled with eros


43
0:5:12,25 --> 0:5:16,87
and thanatos. Because when you die, it's
that seething mind that will carry your spiritual


44
0:5:16,87 --> 0:5:22,2
gene into places where seething beings live...
and you don't want to go in seething places.


45
0:5:22,2 --> 0:5:27,87
In the mystical realms you see what
is called the energetic truth about a person


46
0:5:27,87 --> 0:5:35,0
or another being or a spirit. In the physical
realm we can all disguise ourselves in any


47
0:5:35,0 --> 0:5:41,22
way that we choose. We can be a wolf in sheep's
clothing in the physical realm, but when


48
0:5:41,22 --> 0:5:46,15
you're in the mystical realm what you really
are is what people see.


49
0:5:46,15 --> 0:5:53,0
And there's no deception and there's
no fooling around. You can't get out of it.


50
0:5:53,0 --> 0:5:57,13
You can say, "I don't want this."
Well, that ain't going to do you any good because 


51
0:5:57,13 --> 0:6:3,0
you spent your whole life building your heart.
What we are doing here in this world


52
0:6:3,0 --> 0:6:8,15
is building a heart of love
or building a heart that's not love.


53
0:6:8,15 --> 0:6:14,41
We have to become more like God
in order to go to a higher place.


54
0:6:14,41 --> 0:6:23,71
We go where we're compatible,
as depressing as that may be.


55
0:6:23,71 --> 0:6:26,979
I remember many times that the angels would


56
0:6:26,979 --> 0:6:32,699
show me, "How would you save a world that
serves its function to perfection?" And I


57
0:6:32,699 --> 0:6:38,36
would say, "What you do mean?" And they would
say, "The mortal realms are where the battles


58
0:6:38,36 --> 0:6:45,3
between good and evil rage. They rage around
you, they rage inside of you. This world


59
0:6:45,3 --> 0:6:51,49
is functioning to perfection." The purpose
of being in a mortal realm is to become aware


60
0:6:51,49 --> 0:6:57,21
of that interior process that has to begin,
of purification, and that's when we start


61
0:6:57,21 --> 0:7:3,5
understanding... we understand
that the goal is God.


62
0:7:3,5 --> 0:7:5,349
If you leave your mind filled with


63
0:7:5,349 --> 0:7:10,83
unconscious drives of greed and hatred, eros
and thanatos, then they will drive you into


64
0:7:10,83 --> 0:7:15,97
bad life forms. So the whole goal in a contemplative
culture is to go into the unconscious and


65
0:7:15,97 --> 0:7:22,83
become conscious of it, and to cleanse yourself
of the negative, ego-centered, ignorance-dominated


66
0:7:22,83 --> 0:7:25,5
drives. Like 'I want this' or 'I hate that.'


67
0:7:25,5 --> 0:7:28,259
Why is it so important to purify the soul?


68
0:7:28,259 --> 0:7:32,65
Because that's the true you; that's
who you are. Most people get caught


69
0:7:32,65 --> 0:7:38,22
up with how they look, or they look at the
vehicle that carries the self. It's just


70
0:7:38,22 --> 0:7:44,22
like the person who wants to get a nice body.
They go to Gold's Gym and they lift the


71
0:7:44,22 --> 0:7:48,33
weights and they do the push-ups and the sit-ups
and all these kinds of things. So now, you


72
0:7:48,33 --> 0:7:52,229
do all of that so that you can have a beautiful
body, and what do you do for the inside? So


73
0:7:52,229 --> 0:7:57,0
there's work that you have to do on the
inside so that you can make sure that you


74
0:7:57,0 --> 0:7:58,85
get rid of those vices.


75
0:7:58,85 --> 0:8:1,96
One of the things I've learned
in the spiritual realms is that


76
0:8:1,96 --> 0:8:10,0
a thought of vice is actually what gives dominion
for a demon of that vice to come in and be


77
0:8:10,0 --> 0:8:18,0
around you. So let's say you have a greedy
thought... that is enough grounds for a demon


78
0:8:18,0 --> 0:8:23,919
to come around and start suggesting things
to you. If you have the opposite thought where


79
0:8:23,919 --> 0:8:30,27
you want to be charitable to somebody... that
also gives the same permission for an angel


80
0:8:30,27 --> 0:8:36,14
of that virtue to come in and be around you,
as well. And this is where you begin understanding


81
0:8:36,14 --> 0:8:39,74
the battle that goes on around us.


82
0:8:39,74 --> 0:8:44,1
We've all seen these movies in
which you've got a good


83
0:8:44,1 --> 0:8:49,39
angel and a demon sitting on someone's shoulders
saying, "Go ahead and do this, no, go ahead


84
0:8:49,39 --> 0:8:54,75
and do that." Pulling the dark side and the
bright side of us sort of thing. It's the


85
0:8:54,75 --> 0:9:2,75
truth. As we sit here right now there are
myriads of angels and myriads of demons, there's


86
0:9:2,75 --> 0:9:6,54
light and darkness that's constantly
vying for our soul.


87
0:9:6,54 --> 0:9:9,0
The best way to always describe


88
0:9:9,0 --> 0:9:15,44
what a demon is... is something that was cast
out, tossed down here on earth, into hell,


89
0:9:15,44 --> 0:9:21,1
the pit, whatever you want to call it, and
it's to wreak havoc, to undo everything on


90
0:9:21,1 --> 0:9:26,2
a positive level, to be able to break down
people, to break down their life structures


91
0:9:26,2 --> 0:9:29,1
and to do things on a totally negative level.


92
0:9:29,1 --> 0:9:32,87
In order to begin purifying and begin getting


93
0:9:32,87 --> 0:9:38,33
rid of some of our vices, we have to start
behaving differently and thinking differently


94
0:9:38,33 --> 0:9:42,8
because if you understand that when you
have a simple thought of greed or a simple


95
0:9:42,8 --> 0:9:47,77
thought of vanity, you're giving dominion
for a dark force to be around you and influencing


96
0:9:47,77 --> 0:9:56,8
your thoughts, then you become more and more
aware of how much more vigilance you have


97
0:9:56,8 --> 0:10:0,23
to keep over your mind, heart, and soul so
that you are progressing.


98
0:10:0,23 --> 0:10:5,95
Those that want to change have to first change
the way they think. If you don't change it, you can


99
0:10:5,95 --> 0:10:11,86
dress up a certain way and it seems like everything
is okay... a person could, even a Muslim, he


100
0:10:11,86 --> 0:10:17,67
can learn so many verses from the Koran, he
can stop eating pork, he can fast in the month


101
0:10:17,67 --> 0:10:24,67
of Ramadan, but if he or she have not changed
the way they think, then their behavior is


102
0:10:24,67 --> 0:10:29,68
going to be the same. They might camouflage
it for a while, but then when they get back


103
0:10:29,68 --> 0:10:40,97
into the environment, the same thinking is
there, so the behavior is going to come right back.


104
0:10:40,97 --> 0:10:46,17
St. Francis was gathered in the field
with some of his brothers right outside of


105
0:10:46,17 --> 0:10:53,27
a small town in Umbria and there was a fellow
who had the ability to see demons. And as


106
0:10:53,27 --> 0:11:1,79
he stood in this field he saw legions of demons
as far as he could see that were lined up


107
0:11:1,79 --> 0:11:8,26
in the field who were just plotting as to
how to tempt these Franciscan Friars. Then


108
0:11:8,26 --> 0:11:14,8
he walks down the street to the entrance to
the town and there's one old demon sitting


109
0:11:14,8 --> 0:11:19,0
there yawning, leaning back by the side of
the entrance to the town, and he went to


110
0:11:19,0 --> 0:11:24,19
one of the Franciscan Friars and he said,
"Brother, I've been given this gift to be


111
0:11:24,19 --> 0:11:30,99
able to see these things. Why are there millions
of demons here with you twenty in the field and


112
0:11:30,99 --> 0:11:36,89
only one by the gate that's filled with all
these people," And he said, "Because all that's


113
0:11:36,89 --> 0:11:43,52
needed is one little old demon in order to
bring those people to perdition... but the


114
0:11:43,52 --> 0:11:52,43
devil has to work very hard in order to tempt
those who have given their lives completely to God."


115
0:11:52,43 --> 0:11:57,7
What you have to understand is that
there's a continual warfare that goes on for


116
0:11:57,7 --> 0:12:1,8
every soul on this earth. Much of the time
when we're here on earth, we're thinking all


117
0:12:1,8 --> 0:12:6,55
the battles between good and evil are going
on outside of us but we don't recognize that


118
0:12:6,55 --> 0:12:9,54
that battle is going on inside of us as well.


119
0:12:9,54 --> 0:12:12,54
Anything that's good, a demon or a devil will


120
0:12:12,54 --> 0:12:16,5
do in reverse. Now what do I mean by that?
If a person is a good person and they go to


121
0:12:16,5 --> 0:12:22,36
church and they're trying to lead a halfway
decent life... they will rebel against that,


122
0:12:22,36 --> 0:12:26,51
they'll try to break down that individual,
wear that individual down to be able to get


123
0:12:26,51 --> 0:12:32,53
them to do mean, rotten types of things
and create all kinds of havoc.


124
0:12:32,53 --> 0:12:37,18
What the forces of darkness want us to do is to
spend our life trying to grab for all the gusto that


125
0:12:37,18 --> 0:12:46,2
we can get. To get stuff, and to get things...
and to treat people like things.


126
0:12:46,2 --> 0:12:54,0
There really is a purpose for us being here, and
the purpose is not to live a worldly life, be


127
0:12:54,0 --> 0:12:59,99
successful and all this stuff. The purpose has
to do with this purification process that God sent


128
0:12:59,99 --> 0:13:6,49
us to the mortal realms to overcome. But
if you think about how brilliant this is of


129
0:13:6,49 --> 0:13:14,7
the dark side, if the dark side can get
us to focus entirely on worldly things and


130
0:13:14,7 --> 0:13:21,18
waste our time... works for him, doesn't it? Because
we waste an entire lifetime and accomplish nothing. 


131
0:13:21,18 --> 0:13:27,99
Are demons clever? They are the most
sophisticated, most cunning things you could


132
0:13:27,99 --> 0:13:33,37
ever deal with. Why? They have the wisdom
of the ages. They have the knowledge of the


133
0:13:33,37 --> 0:13:37,74
ages. They know how to manipulate things.
They know how to trick people. They know how


134
0:13:37,74 --> 0:13:43,0
to do things very, very... cunning is the
best way I can describe it.


135
0:13:43,0 --> 0:13:45,5
Now usually what happens


136
0:13:45,5 --> 0:13:52,26
when people really turn their path towards
God is that they will begin what will become


137
0:13:52,26 --> 0:13:58,52
almost a real warfare for their soul. And
a lot of people are really surprised by this.


138
0:13:58,52 --> 0:14:5,37
But as long as we're kind of content and lackadaisical
about just living life and not doing anything,


139
0:14:5,37 --> 0:14:12,26
the demons and Satan already has dominion
over us, so they don't have to make themselves


140
0:14:12,26 --> 0:14:19,5
known. But when we turn away and we start saying,
"We want God," then they have to fight for us.


141
0:14:19,5 --> 0:14:24,18
The more spiritual an individual
is, the more they pray, the more that they


142
0:14:24,18 --> 0:14:31,18
are into their belief system, the more of
a target that individual actually can be.


143
0:14:31,18 --> 0:14:37,46
Because trying to win a very spiritual individual
over - no matter what denomination you're


144
0:14:37,46 --> 0:14:40,6
talking about... that's like the grand prize.


145
0:14:40,6 --> 0:14:42,66
But you have to push through this warfare,


146
0:14:42,66 --> 0:14:46,51
you cannot back down. Because that's their
goal, is that they want to wear you down


147
0:14:46,51 --> 0:14:50,51
so you're so tired you're like, "This is
too hard, I'm just going to go back to my


148
0:14:50,51 --> 0:14:53,5
lackadaisical lifestyle, nothing
bothered me then."


149
0:14:53,5 --> 0:14:55,2
I think it's probably wise to


150
0:14:55,2 --> 0:15:0,82
admit this about ourselves and our society
that evil is real, people are not always


151
0:15:0,82 --> 0:15:6,38
going to be good or do good. And to be open
to the idea that some of those forces of evil


152
0:15:6,38 --> 0:15:11,1
just as the forces of good may be
invisible, and that whether one calls it a


153
0:15:11,1 --> 0:15:17,19
devil or not is maybe less important than
realizing that there are evils that we cannot


154
0:15:17,19 --> 0:15:22,54
see, evils that are spiritual that we only
partially grasp, and we should be humbled


155
0:15:22,54 --> 0:15:27,5
before reality, that we don't control
the good, we don't control the evil, and


156
0:15:27,5 --> 0:15:32,18
there may be forces around us that can hurt us and
help us and we have to find our way between them.


157
0:15:32,18 --> 0:15:37,79
The most powerful thing against
the demons in any of the spheres is - I'm


158
0:15:37,79 --> 0:15:42,0
going to say something that the exorcists usually
say - which is confession. The sacrament of


159
0:15:42,0 --> 0:15:48,19
confession is, according to many exorcists,
more powerful than the rite of exorcism, but


160
0:15:48,19 --> 0:15:52,5
in my experience in the mystical realms...
the reason that's the case is because by confessing


161
0:15:52,5 --> 0:15:58,58
your sins, you are taking away the dominion
that they have. They have dominion because


162
0:15:58,58 --> 0:16:4,58
of your agreement to certain sins or vices
or ways of thinking.


163
0:16:4,58 --> 0:16:6,89
You are your catalyst.


164
0:16:6,89 --> 0:16:12,86
That's the best way I can describe that to
you. You are in control of your vessel. You


165
0:16:12,86 --> 0:16:18,81
have to fight back. You have to protect yourself.
And the way I recommend to anybody is


166
0:16:18,81 --> 0:16:23,0
I don't care if you worship a 5 pound quartz
crystal. I don't care what it is. As long


167
0:16:23,0 --> 0:16:29,4
as it's on a positive. You call upon that
positive to be able to help protect yourself...


168
0:16:29,4 --> 0:16:35,44
and you have to fight back.


169
0:16:35,44 --> 0:16:39,48
In regards to some of the demons
associated with the deadly sins,


170
0:16:39,48 --> 0:16:46,96
there is a demon of rage... and it's interesting
because the demon of rage operates


171
0:16:46,96 --> 0:16:52,51
and appears very much like a person who has
an uncontrollable rage issue. It's a small


172
0:16:52,51 --> 0:17:0,0
little snake, and you can see it in the mystical
realm, but when it becomes energized it becomes


173
0:17:0,0 --> 0:17:8,48
huge, red, pumping with fury, and you've
got to get out of it's way... and so that's


174
0:17:8,48 --> 0:17:12,5
one of the demons of rage.


175
0:17:12,5 --> 0:17:17,569
Narcissism, which is an aspect
of pride, and a lot of these


176
0:17:17,569 --> 0:17:22,329
things are offshoots of the deadly sins, but
like narcissism in particular there's a demon


177
0:17:22,329 --> 0:17:29,329
called Gold Eyes. He's a very frightening
demon. When he is inside the soul of a person


178
0:17:29,329 --> 0:17:35,68
he will appear as this gold light coming through
their eyes and he's so enraged... and it's


179
0:17:35,68 --> 0:17:40,86
an imperialistic rage. It's like the rage
that you would see from someone who feels


180
0:17:40,86 --> 0:17:47,65
very entitled. When you get this creature
to come out it's like a big raging wall of


181
0:17:47,65 --> 0:17:54,4
fire... and that's narcissism and imperialistic rage.


182
0:17:54,4 --> 0:17:57,17
The Gull demon is a demon of destructive


183
0:17:57,17 --> 0:18:2,84
sexuality. The worst ones, which would be
the incubus and the succubus, these are much


184
0:18:2,84 --> 0:18:8,2
more higher caliber demons, they have a lot
more strength and they can do a lot more damage


185
0:18:8,2 --> 0:18:13,81
to a soul. These have to do with lust. You'll
see them as very attractive but when they


186
0:18:13,81 --> 0:18:19,72
reveal themselves they're like a skeleton
with flesh hanging from it, spider webs... almost


187
0:18:19,72 --> 0:18:26,31
like a corpse that's been decomposing. You
know how it says in the scriptures somewhere,


188
0:18:26,31 --> 0:18:30,56
"Outside they look one way and inside
they're like a ravening wolf."


189
0:18:30,56 --> 0:18:34,56
That's the way the demonic is.


190
0:18:34,56 --> 0:18:41,0
One of the most important and most
disturbing demons to mention is called


191
0:18:41,0 --> 0:18:48,1
the Lord Demon, and one of the reasons it's
so disturbing is because of its commonality.


192
0:18:48,1 --> 0:18:55,2
Christ showed me this demon and I was so overwhelmed
by the power of this demon... and then He showed


193
0:18:55,2 --> 0:19:2,17
me... it was a real, real mortal battle
to the death kind of thing. I mean, this demon


194
0:19:2,17 --> 0:19:9,31
was really sneaky. The Lord Demon represents,
more than anything, self-intelligence... so


195
0:19:9,31 --> 0:19:17,4
you have to have the ego, you have to have
the greed, and the avarice is anger that's


196
0:19:17,4 --> 0:19:24,4
disordered. The Lord Demon is the most common
demon in the world today because we're so


197
0:19:24,4 --> 0:19:30,2
smart as human beings, we're so self-intelligent,
that we're smarter than God, right? We want


198
0:19:30,2 --> 0:19:37,29
the opinion of God, the opinion of the prophets,
saints, mystics and sages from all time, to


199
0:19:37,29 --> 0:19:45,59
be of equal value to every single one of us
down here below. But in reality, it's not.


200
0:19:45,59 --> 0:19:53,95
If you have to hold on to the self-intelligence
that, "I'm right. This whole concept of demons


201
0:19:53,95 --> 0:20:2,0
is illogical. The concept that God would not
just love all His creatures no matter what


202
0:20:2,0 --> 0:20:9,0
is illogical," then you're going to be visiting
with the Lord Demon. And the Lord Demon, Jesus


203
0:20:9,0 --> 0:20:15,83
Christ also told me, was the most common cause
of damnation today. And that's interesting


204
0:20:15,83 --> 0:20:22,88
because in Fatima in 1917, when the Blessed
Virgin appeared to the three shepherd children,


205
0:20:22,88 --> 0:20:29,0
she had said the most common reason for souls
to go to hell at that time was sins of impurity.


206
0:20:29,0 --> 0:20:33,51
But our society has become so arrogant


207
0:20:33,51 --> 0:20:39,41
that we have become smarter than God. Think
about that. Think about us down here in the


208
0:20:39,41 --> 0:20:47,85
third and fourth realm, and God somewhere
ad infinitum, and we believe that. That's


209
0:20:47,85 --> 0:20:52,8
not going to allow us to grow. And the Lord
Demon is so sneaky, all he has to do is convince


210
0:20:52,8 --> 0:20:59,73
you that it's illogical... religion is illogical,
the moral code is illogical, the ten commandments


211
0:20:59,73 --> 0:21:6,45
are illogical. But if we think that we're
smarter than the simple moral code, we think


212
0:21:6,45 --> 0:21:14,8
that anything can be changed according to
our simple whims, we become really vulnerable


213
0:21:14,8 --> 0:21:23,82
to having a voice speaking inside of us telling
us we're right, and it gets harder and harder


214
0:21:23,82 --> 0:21:27,98
to get away from this one because the Lord
Demon is really, really powerful. This is


215
0:21:27,98 --> 0:21:36,44
not like some little pansy demon. This Lord
Demon is a scary creature, and he will come


216
0:21:36,44 --> 0:21:40,51
to you and when you see him in the mystical,
when he becomes his true self, his teeth


217
0:21:40,51 --> 0:21:47,38
are all pointy, he turns red and black and
blood oozes from his pores and his teeth,


218
0:21:47,38 --> 0:21:51,82
and there's flesh on his teeth... he's the
most disgusting creature you'll ever see, but...


219
0:21:51,82 --> 0:22:33,0
boy, is he good at what he does.


220
0:22:33,0 --> 0:22:37,75
Before my experience with Jesus I was a successful,


221
0:22:37,75 --> 0:22:46,17
A+, American guy, who believed that it's a
dog-eat-dog world, life is about competition


222
0:22:46,17 --> 0:22:54,36
and winning and not being a loser. Life is
about not being the victim but being the aggressor


223
0:22:54,36 --> 0:23:2,2
and I tried to bully my way in my relationships.
I tried to intimidate people. I didn't hesitate


224
0:23:2,2 --> 0:23:9,58
to physically assault people and verbally
assault them. I did very well. I got


225
0:23:9,58 --> 0:23:18,1
promotions, I got money, I got prestige, I
got honors. I was a winner. I was very aggressive


226
0:23:18,1 --> 0:23:27,57
with my wife, with my children. A lot of people
despised me and I was glad of it because I


227
0:23:27,57 --> 0:23:32,73
figured part of the quality of being a winner
was that there were casualties in your relationships


228
0:23:32,73 --> 0:23:38,82
along the way. And my friends were people
that subscribed to the same sort of highly


229
0:23:38,82 --> 0:23:47,75
assertive, self-centered, narcissistic, point
of view. I believe that there is no such thing


230
0:23:47,75 --> 0:23:52,5
as an atheist, I believe that everybody has
a God. The only question is, "Who's your


231
0:23:52,5 --> 0:23:58,39
god?" And for atheists, their god is themselves.
So they have these little bitty gods, which


232
0:23:58,39 --> 0:24:3,33
is their self, and that was me and my friends.
We were all in love with ourselves and that's


233
0:24:3,33 --> 0:24:11,79
who we worshipped. Having yourself as a god
fails in a crisis because you have nobody


234
0:24:11,79 --> 0:24:16,309
to turn to because you can't do anything about
the circumstances, they're just collapsing


235
0:24:16,309 --> 0:24:22,25
around you. I was dying in a hospital and
it was catastrophic, and you have nothing


236
0:24:22,25 --> 0:24:29,17
left but hopelessness and despair and a very
fatalistic, nihilistic view of the world, that


237
0:24:29,17 --> 0:24:35,3
life sucks and then you die and who cares.
Which is pretty bleak when you think about it.


238
0:24:35,3 --> 0:24:48,72
And that's what I was believing when I
died on June 1, 1985 at 38 years old. 


239
0:24:48,72 --> 0:24:51,11
Your consciousness, when you die, doesn't


240
0:24:51,11 --> 0:24:57,96
cease. That's the interesting thing is that
consciousness survives bodily death. And so


241
0:24:57,96 --> 0:25:4,96
when you have a negative consciousness you
get to go into negative world... the world


242
0:25:4,96 --> 0:25:13,77
where 'of like' people and like consciousness
and it's a very cruel and brutal and horrible place.


243
0:25:13,77 --> 0:25:20,68
It was much like what has been described
as rats when they over-reproduce in too small


244
0:25:20,68 --> 0:25:26,0
a cage and they just start gnawing on each
other. That's what they were doing... basically


245
0:25:26,0 --> 0:25:35,2
people biting, tearing, ripping each
other apart continuously.


246
0:25:35,2 --> 0:25:37,0
One of the things as a priest,


247
0:25:37,0 --> 0:25:41,36
I've been a priest for 31 years, and
one of the things that is the most wonderful


248
0:25:41,36 --> 0:25:46,61
moment in the day is when at 2:30 in the morning
you get a call to go to the hospital and somebody's


249
0:25:46,61 --> 0:25:52,71
dying. At first you grumble that it's 2:30
in the morning - I got this 7 o'clock mass


250
0:25:52,71 --> 0:25:59,0
tomorrow, I'm going to be tired all day, and
you whine about that. And then you get up


251
0:25:59,0 --> 0:26:5,24
and you go to the hospital. But when you're
standing by that bed, and you look at everybody


252
0:26:5,24 --> 0:26:14,94
standing around it, life is clearer and makes
more sense at that moment than it does any


253
0:26:14,94 --> 0:26:22,4
other time during the day. Because at that
moment there's no one who dies saying, "I


254
0:26:22,4 --> 0:26:29,67
wish I'd gotten more stuff. I wish I'd committed
more sin. I wish I'd been more selfish."


255
0:26:29,67 --> 0:26:37,57
They all die saying, "I wish I'd loved more."


256
0:26:37,57 --> 0:26:39,53
I thought about my life, and as I thought


257
0:26:39,53 --> 0:26:46,18
about my life I realized, since I'd been a
teacher all my life, that somehow I'd missed


258
0:26:46,18 --> 0:26:51,87
the whole point, that whatever the point
of life was not only had I missed it but I


259
0:26:51,87 --> 0:26:58,17
failed it. I'd failed to recognize what the
course was about and I was clueless and whatever


260
0:26:58,17 --> 0:27:4,87
I was supposed to have achieved I didn't achieve
it because I ended up in this cesspool... this


261
0:27:4,87 --> 0:27:9,16
horrible cesspool. And so obviously
I was a big failure.


262
0:27:9,16 --> 0:27:11,16
One of the beautiful things


263
0:27:11,16 --> 0:27:14,87
about Hindu tradition is that God is very,
very accommodating, God is very open to


264
0:27:14,87 --> 0:27:21,15
adjustment and whatever way a human being
happens to be heading or wandering, God is


265
0:27:21,15 --> 0:27:26,73
able to go there and meet the person there.
The example is given in some scriptures that


266
0:27:26,73 --> 0:27:31,51
if we are seeking God in a very basic way,
we're like little children running around


267
0:27:31,51 --> 0:27:37,59
in the courtyard and God is like our mother
who will find us wherever we are, both to


268
0:27:37,59 --> 0:27:40,16
protect us from harm and to make us well.


269
0:27:40,16 --> 0:27:43,7
We can trust that God's love and mercy will


270
0:27:43,7 --> 0:27:49,72
overcome our sinfulness. And that's true whether
we're the worst sinner in the world or whether


271
0:27:49,72 --> 0:27:56,59
we've actually led a pretty decent God-fearing
upright life of kindness and mercy and compassion.


272
0:27:56,59 --> 0:28:2,7
That God's grace is what brings us into a
right relationship with Him in the last analysis.


273
0:28:2,7 --> 0:28:7,62
Yes, we respond by good works and so on and
so forth, and all we have to do is simply


274
0:28:7,62 --> 0:28:9,76
acknowledge that we need that grace.


275
0:28:9,76 --> 0:28:13,46
After the people in darkness had devastated me and


276
0:28:13,46 --> 0:28:24,76
emotionally, psychologically, spiritually
had torn me down to nothing... I heard my voice


277
0:28:24,76 --> 0:28:31,98
say, "Pray to God." And I thought I don't
pray, I don't believe in God... that's what


278
0:28:31,98 --> 0:28:37,58
I thought... and the voice said, "Pray to God."
And I thought I don't know how to pray, I


279
0:28:37,58 --> 0:28:45,57
don't pray. And the voice said, "Pray to God."
And I thought - I used to pray, I knew how


280
0:28:45,57 --> 0:28:47,51
to pray once!


281
0:28:47,51 --> 0:28:52,51
No matter where we are, the second
a soul wants God, God comes - just


282
0:28:52,51 --> 0:29:0,22
like that! It's amazing to me because to me
that demonstrates mercy... that's what love


283
0:29:0,22 --> 0:29:5,809
and mercy is, and that's the corrective,
merciful love of God. Because every single


284
0:29:5,809 --> 0:29:10,21
one of these people - and many of these people
have written to me who've had these experiences


285
0:29:10,21 --> 0:29:16,22
to hell and have called out for help - have
been so blown away by that merciful nature


286
0:29:16,22 --> 0:29:18,52
of God their entire life changes.


287
0:29:18,52 --> 0:29:23,37
There is in the universe a caring,
a love, a compassion,


288
0:29:23,37 --> 0:29:28,14
some kind of meaning to the universe, and
I called out to that and I said, "Jesus please


289
0:29:28,14 --> 0:29:34,9
save me." And with that, He - Jesus - the
being of light, the ambassador of God, came


290
0:29:34,9 --> 0:29:41,15
over me and loved me and took me out of that
place. And that changed everything and my


291
0:29:41,15 --> 0:29:47,5
whole life, my entire life for the past 25
years has all been about that moment and


292
0:29:47,5 --> 0:29:57,57
trying to get people to say, "God I need you.
Jesus I need you. Allah help me." However


293
0:29:57,57 --> 0:29:59,57
they can express it.


294
0:29:59,57 --> 0:30:3,2
If we put our reliance back towards
where it should be, which is


295
0:30:3,2 --> 0:30:11,2
on God, and we don't make ourselves our own
gods, we humble ourselves and let God lovingly


296
0:30:11,2 --> 0:30:18,83
correct us and bring us through that path
of purification. He will! He will not leave


297
0:30:18,83 --> 0:30:25,83
you behind. The only time people are left
where they are is because the really, truly,


298
0:30:25,83 --> 0:30:30,38
honestly want to be there - and that's one
of the hardest things for people to understand


299
0:30:30,38 --> 0:30:35,45
is that you stay there because you don't want
to do anything different, you like it the


300
0:30:35,45 --> 0:30:45,59
way things are. You're compatible to it!


301
0:30:45,59 --> 0:30:48,36
The dogma of materialism I think arose from


302
0:30:48,36 --> 0:30:56,26
the dogma of the inquisition, of the Christian
Church, and burning Giordano Bruno and muzzling


303
0:30:56,26 --> 0:31:2,15
Galileo Galilei and many other lesser people...
burning and muzzling. And so to escape from


304
0:31:2,15 --> 0:31:9,1
that after the Renaissance and Reformation
and Enlightenment, the thinkers and intelligentsia


305
0:31:9,1 --> 0:31:14,82
in Europe went to another extreme to get away
from being dominated by the church and being


306
0:31:14,82 --> 0:31:19,0
threatened with hell and so forth, and so
they abandoned having a soul. They decided


307
0:31:19,0 --> 0:31:26,62
we don't even have one. We're just
a species, we have genes, we have drives,


308
0:31:26,62 --> 0:31:32,73
survival of the fittest, and went on through
all of those different theories. And then


309
0:31:32,73 --> 0:31:38,49
they got to where they, like Carl Sagan, one
of his last books was When Demons Stalked


310
0:31:38,49 --> 0:31:42,79
the Earth, and it had to do with the Fundamentalists
that he'd had to tangle with in Arkansas


311
0:31:42,79 --> 0:31:48,38
and other places as a scientist. And the idea
was that if anything non-physical were admitted


312
0:31:48,38 --> 0:31:55,38
to exist in the world, this would open the
door for all kinds of crazies and new inquisitions


313
0:31:55,38 --> 0:32:1,99
and demented creationists... like the world
is 7,000 years old and the Grand Canyon was


314
0:32:1,99 --> 0:32:7,799
made in a flash flood and Adam was a white
guy... just a silly bunch of stuff. And then


315
0:32:7,799 --> 0:32:12,26
they'd end up getting political power, these
religions, and they'd start clamping down


316
0:32:12,26 --> 0:32:15,559
on free thought and scientific discovery
like they did before.


317
0:32:15,559 --> 0:32:17,559
Did the Garden of Eden really happen?


318
0:32:17,559 --> 0:32:23,559
Was the world made, the universe made
in literally seven days... or six days and


319
0:32:23,559 --> 0:32:28,77
a day of rest? I mean, is that how it really
happened? That God spoke the universe into


320
0:32:28,77 --> 0:32:35,2
being? And sometimes in discourse religious
people can't get passed that - that it's real


321
0:32:35,2 --> 0:32:42,2
facts - into a discourse about an even deeper
truth underneath which is a description of


322
0:32:42,2 --> 0:32:47,45
the estrangement in the human community
and between human beings and God.


323
0:32:47,45 --> 0:32:50,59
We let the details trip us up.


324
0:32:50,59 --> 0:32:54,96
So the dogma of materialism in
a spiritual sense boils down to that view


325
0:32:54,96 --> 0:33:1,25
of not understanding the common sense reality
and scientific viability of former and future


326
0:33:1,25 --> 0:33:10,86
lives - in some form - and that's the heart
wrong view of our psychotic culture, which


327
0:33:10,86 --> 0:33:15,37
thinks it's not connected to the world,
it can keep messing with the climate, it can


328
0:33:15,37 --> 0:33:21,23
kill off all the animals, cut all the trees,
do whatever it is. The rapture people do it


329
0:33:21,23 --> 0:33:25,86
as a sort of warped spiritual thing, but the
materialists do it because, 'I'm not


330
0:33:25,86 --> 0:33:29,74
going to be here, so I'm going to use it
up.' And then they will say, 'Oh, no,


331
0:33:29,74 --> 0:33:33,53
but I'm not unethical, I'm a humanist
and I care about my children so I'm


332
0:33:33,53 --> 0:33:36,73
not going to wreck the planet." But actually
they are wrecking the planet.


333
0:33:36,73 --> 0:33:44,88
If we waste the time here, if we don't take the
time to purify ourselves or to move upwards then


334
0:33:44,88 --> 0:33:52,59
we're going to start circling. And what I
mean by circling is when you see people


335
0:33:52,59 --> 0:33:56,66
for those who believe in reincarnation... and
I've had a lot of experiences myself - I didn't


336
0:33:56,66 --> 0:34:0,91
believe in the reincarnation until I started
having mystical experiences about them and


337
0:34:0,91 --> 0:34:6,35
I've had thousands of them now... but for those
who believe in reincarnation you end up coming


338
0:34:6,35 --> 0:34:11,179
back and doing the same thing over and over
again, with the same characters, the same


339
0:34:11,179 --> 0:34:17,329
configuration. And until you see, "I'm doing
something wrong here... there's a reason why


340
0:34:17,329 --> 0:34:21,83
I keep doing the same thing." And it's made
more difficult because most people don't remember


341
0:34:21,83 --> 0:34:28,46
their previous lives. But sometimes when people
become more spiritually alert you'd be surprised


342
0:34:28,46 --> 0:34:30,1
how quickly they start remembering.


343
0:34:30,1 --> 0:34:33,1
There's a very strong sense
in the most ancient parts


344
0:34:33,1 --> 0:34:41,129
of Hinduism that we are, in fact, on a journey
that takes many lifetimes. To be a being in


345
0:34:41,129 --> 0:34:46,52
this world is not done in a short period of
time, even if that short period of time is


346
0:34:46,52 --> 0:34:53,8
100 years, but that the purification of nature,
the discovery of true identity comes in small


347
0:34:53,8 --> 0:35:0,109
packets, which we would call one lifetime
or another lifetime. And in Hinduism, as in


348
0:35:0,109 --> 0:35:5,28
Jainism and Buddhism, there is a sense that
one can be reborn again and again into new


349
0:35:5,28 --> 0:35:10,68
bodies as one journeys along one's path.
There is no guarantee, of course, that every


350
0:35:10,68 --> 0:35:15,95
body and every rebirth is better than the
one before because we're really faced with


351
0:35:15,95 --> 0:35:19,66
the prospect of what do you do with the body
you have, what do you do with the opportunities


352
0:35:19,66 --> 0:35:25,67
of your current life? And then, in a sense,
that if we use those well, we move into


353
0:35:25,67 --> 0:35:32,74
more pure, more focused bodies that are directed
to the divine. And if we become distracted,


354
0:35:32,74 --> 0:35:38,17
if we begin to forget who we are, then we
might come back in a body that is more immersed


355
0:35:38,17 --> 0:35:43,609
in matter and less able to be open to the
divine. So, there is a way in which every


356
0:35:43,609 --> 0:35:48,53
life is extremely important because it really
charts our way on the course, and yet every


357
0:35:48,53 --> 0:35:52,219
life also is simply part of a much larger
journey that takes a much longer time.


358
0:35:52,219 --> 0:35:57,97
There's a karmic understanding to everything
which is something that's not quite correct, and


359
0:35:57,97 --> 0:36:3,43
there's an eternal understanding which is
the real truth. And so we circle and we keep


360
0:36:3,43 --> 0:36:8,64
doing the same thing over because we have
a karmic understanding, which doesn't create


361
0:36:8,64 --> 0:36:15,32
peace. It's very chaotic... we're usually
messed up. Once we reach that eternal understanding


362
0:36:15,32 --> 0:36:21,52
there's peace. And that's one of the ways
you can tell. Like when someone meets a new


363
0:36:21,52 --> 0:36:28,369
person, if it's an eternal thing there'll
be a lot of peace. If it's karmic, there may


364
0:36:28,369 --> 0:36:33,51
be a lot of chaos and a lot of really intense
emotions and things like that. That may very


365
0:36:33,51 --> 0:36:39,79
well indicate that there is an issue that's
coming up from previous existences that either


366
0:36:39,79 --> 0:36:45,99
has to do with you and that particular person,
or it's just that this particular person is


367
0:36:45,99 --> 0:36:52,6
going to play that role that has been played
for you before in previous existences... and


368
0:36:52,6 --> 0:36:59,0
that's why it brings up all this intensity.
But a lot of times even something that starts


369
0:36:59,0 --> 0:37:8,56
out karmic, if the two parties are seeking
an eternal solution, it can end up well. It


370
0:37:8,56 --> 0:37:15,35
can become eternal. It can amend to an eternal
situation if the two parties both go in that direction.


371
0:37:15,35 --> 0:37:20,84
I think a lot of individuals can
be reincarnated because there was karma carried


372
0:37:20,84 --> 0:37:25,98
over from a past life. And some of the traditional
belief systems in that is that people keep


373
0:37:25,98 --> 0:38:5,0
reincarnating and reincarnating until
they actually get it right.


374
0:38:5,0 --> 0:38:8,3
So how does one become more spiritually alert?


375
0:38:8,3 --> 0:38:12,27
You do so by doing what every
human being has done for the last


376
0:38:12,27 --> 0:38:16,72
several thousand years. If you look at the
ancient sacred texts throughout history from


377
0:38:16,72 --> 0:38:23,119
every single world religion it's the same
process. It's prayer - prayer is speaking


378
0:38:23,119 --> 0:38:29,98
to God; Meditation is listening and trying
to get that answer; and Spiritual Reading,


379
0:38:29,98 --> 0:38:36,619
which is utilizing the works of all those
people who've come before us who have figured


380
0:38:36,619 --> 0:38:43,0
it out. And there are many, many people like
that from Tibet's Milarepa to Catholicism's


381
0:38:43,0 --> 0:38:51,359
St. Francis DeSales and St. Catherine of Siena
to... Earth Store Bodhisattva was a Buddhist


382
0:38:51,359 --> 0:38:55,8
monk who had a similar calling that I have
where he would actually go into hell realms


383
0:38:55,8 --> 0:39:2,76
and liberate souls. So you do the spiritual
reading to form your conscience better. The


384
0:39:2,76 --> 0:39:8,0
more of the spiritual reading you do, the
more sensitive you become to what is vice


385
0:39:8,0 --> 0:39:10,35
and what is a virtue.


386
0:39:10,35 --> 0:39:13,4
If you're not putting good thoughts
or good scripture in your mind


387
0:39:13,4 --> 0:39:18,6
and in your soul, then something else is coming
in. So if you're a person who's always


388
0:39:18,6 --> 0:39:23,0
in front of the television, always watching
violent movies or whatever the case may be,


389
0:39:23,0 --> 0:39:28,23
always involved with that, then your soul
is being fed something but it's not being


390
0:39:28,23 --> 0:39:33,2
fed anything that's going to elevate you
or lift you up. In order for your soul to


391
0:39:33,2 --> 0:39:40,5
be lifted up you have read and study and reflect
and meditate on good things.


392
0:39:40,5 --> 0:39:45,84
The worship, the prayer, the visits to Holy sites,
the reading of the books, are not to say the more


393
0:39:45,84 --> 0:39:52,22
we have the better off we'll be, but all
of these are wisdom and advice that lead us


394
0:39:52,22 --> 0:39:59,22
toward letting go of the things
that stand in the way.


395
0:39:59,22 --> 0:40:2,46
Prayer is saying I want to be


396
0:40:2,46 --> 0:40:7,71
a part of that life of God in me and to let
it more and more fill me, my conscious life,


397
0:40:7,71 --> 0:40:14,57
so that more and more of how I live, how
I speak, how I listen, how I make choices


398
0:40:14,57 --> 0:40:19,0
is caught up in what God
wants to do through me.


399
0:40:19,0 --> 0:40:21,53
Just think about being in this world,


400
0:40:21,53 --> 0:40:26,74
where you have to make a living, and it's
the hustle and bustle in life... always


401
0:40:26,74 --> 0:40:32,32
running, always running and you take
out five times of the day where you have this


402
0:40:32,32 --> 0:40:38,17
spiritual refreshment called prayer. You take
a break from all that hustle and bustle. It's


403
0:40:38,17 --> 0:40:43,47
something that empowers you, and it's something
that keeps you grounded, because you can


404
0:40:43,47 --> 0:40:50,0
get lost out there just going after the dollar. And then,
it's like nothing else counts, nothing else matters.


405
0:40:50,0 --> 0:40:56,27
Prayer is a very powerful thing.
I recommend it to people continuously


406
0:40:56,27 --> 0:41:2,1
no matter what your structure is, no matter
what your belief system is. There are all


407
0:41:2,1 --> 0:41:7,41
sets of prayers in different belief systems
out there. I recommend very strongly to people


408
0:41:7,41 --> 0:41:14,4
call upon that. It doesn't hurt to say prayers.
It's a very positive element in our lives.


409
0:41:14,4 --> 0:41:21,99
A lot of times we believe when we're praying
that we should be answered in a certain way,


410
0:41:21,99 --> 0:41:28,99
but in reality, we have to remember that God
knows exactly what we need at any given time.


411
0:41:28,99 --> 0:41:34,47
And God's purpose isn't the same as ours.
Our purpose is often very motivated by the


412
0:41:34,47 --> 0:41:41,1
fact that we're in denial that this is a temporary
place of existence. So God is not motivated


413
0:41:41,1 --> 0:41:47,0
by continuing our denial about the impermanence
of this life. He's motivated by what is going


414
0:41:47,0 --> 0:41:55,16
to give this soul the most progress spiritually
at this time. And I have seen many situations


415
0:41:55,16 --> 0:42:3,74
where miraculous things have occurred and
many other situations where the answer is no.


416
0:42:3,74 --> 0:42:8,79
Nobody can explain that except God because
only God knows why He says yes and why He


417
0:42:8,79 --> 0:42:17,7
says no and why other times He says no, but
how about this? But it's because God has that


418
0:42:17,7 --> 0:42:28,0
all-knowing where He understands
what we need to progress.


419
0:42:28,0 --> 0:42:32,369
We live in a society that's got a lot of noise.


420
0:42:32,369 --> 0:42:36,71
Listen to yourself and see what yourself
is saying. Take time out.


421
0:42:36,71 --> 0:42:40,53
There are so many people that don't take
time out. Some people can't even go to


422
0:42:40,53 --> 0:42:45,19
sleep unless the music is playing. They can't
go to sleep unless the television is on. And


423
0:42:45,19 --> 0:42:48,63
there's noise everywhere, so shut it down.
Once you shut it down you're going to hear


424
0:42:48,63 --> 0:42:51,66
something inside yourself. You have
something talking within you.


425
0:42:51,66 --> 0:42:53,66
God will use anything and everything


426
0:42:53,66 --> 0:42:57,4
to reach out to us. God always is.
God's always trying to connect with us.


427
0:42:57,4 --> 0:43:2,3
We forget that. We think, 'Oh, I have to
go and find God.' But, in fact, it's more


428
0:43:2,3 --> 0:43:6,0
like opening our eyes to what's already there.
God is reaching out to us all the time.


429
0:43:6,0 --> 0:43:10,859
It's a lot like tuning your radio. Like when
you're in a rural area and you're trying to find


430
0:43:10,859 --> 0:43:17,75
something to listen to and you're either pressing
the digital thing or turning the dial trying


431
0:43:17,75 --> 0:43:24,33
to find a radio station. Then you get some
real terrible country-western thing... you're


432
0:43:24,33 --> 0:43:28,859
searching, searching, searching for something
good to listen to - then finally you found it,


433
0:43:28,859 --> 0:43:35,23
and you fine tune your radio just so you
get it. You got to seek God. And there's


434
0:43:35,23 --> 0:43:44,2
a lot of voices out there like... chase the
ladies, get more money, grow more hair, have


435
0:43:44,2 --> 0:43:49,95
flat abdominal muscles so you'll be desirable
to chicks... whatever. There are all these


436
0:43:49,95 --> 0:43:54,619
voices out there booming at you all the time,
telling you all this like crazy and often


437
0:43:54,619 --> 0:44:0,99
stupid stuff - and it's bad stuff. And so
to tune in God, which is always the voice


438
0:44:0,99 --> 0:44:10,2
of love and kindness and peace and hope and
joy - that's how you recognize it, because


439
0:44:10,2 --> 0:44:14,609
that's what it sounds like... when you get to
that voice and then to be able to focus on it.


440
0:44:14,609 --> 0:44:22,84
And the thing that's not so hard is
it's there, and if you contemplate love,


441
0:44:22,84 --> 0:44:26,5
contemplate goodness - you can find it.


442
0:44:26,5 --> 0:44:28,97
I seek to be with God in praying. I seek to


443
0:44:28,97 --> 0:44:32,82
be with God in hanging around with Him and
those who nobody else will have anything to


444
0:44:32,82 --> 0:44:39,39
do with. I seek to be with God through the
sacraments in a wonderful way. I seek to be


445
0:44:39,39 --> 0:44:44,95
with God through doing what is right, through
working for justice. So there are all kinds


446
0:44:44,95 --> 0:44:53,7
of ways I seek to be with God, but at the base
of it all is shutting up and letting Him talk to me.


447
0:44:53,7 --> 0:44:58,72
We all have guardian angels, we all have
forces around us that are trying to lead


448
0:44:58,72 --> 0:45:5,46
us towards the good, but we've blocked it
all out with noise, with sin, with vice, with


449
0:45:5,46 --> 0:45:11,46
just certain ways of thinking - so they can't
reach us. We have to re-open the channel so


450
0:45:11,46 --> 0:45:18,38
that God can show us what He put us here to
do. And if we do that He will show us and


451
0:45:18,38 --> 0:45:23,0
it becomes really easy because He does show
you every step of the way.


452
0:45:23,0 --> 0:45:26,5
If you get quiet and say,


453
0:45:26,5 --> 0:45:31,98
"God, what do I need to do?" God will
let you know, but it's not necessarily


454
0:45:31,98 --> 0:45:43,82
in a big Charlton Heston booming voice broadcast.
It's more in the Elijah sense... in the small,


455
0:45:43,82 --> 0:46:0,43
still inner voice. You just contemplate something
and then you know that you know that you know.


456
0:46:0,43 --> 0:46:5,109
When my journey began Jesus came to me and
He said it was time for my purification and


457
0:46:5,109 --> 0:46:11,25
He said, "Gather the ancient sacred texts
and all the ancient prayer books because you're


458
0:46:11,25 --> 0:46:15,359
going to learn from them." And He took me
through - I didn't even know what they were.


459
0:46:15,359 --> 0:46:20,63
He showed me and He told me... He would give
me these strange names, like the Holy Teaching


460
0:46:20,63 --> 0:46:26,359
of Vimalakirti... I was like, "How am I going
to find that?" But I went through this process


461
0:46:26,359 --> 0:46:31,17
and He would tell me what to look for. One
was the Dialogues of St. Catherine of Siena,


462
0:46:31,17 --> 0:46:39,25
which explains Christian mysticism and redemption
in such a way that it remains my favorite


463
0:46:39,25 --> 0:46:45,76
books to this day. I really loved the writings,
and was led to read the writings of Imam Ghazali


464
0:46:45,76 --> 0:46:52,16
who is one of the mystical theologians of
Islam. He wrote a really great text called


465
0:46:52,16 --> 0:47:0,0
the Ihya Ulumuddin - and I actually ordered
that from overseas. And it's interesting because


466
0:47:0,0 --> 0:47:7,45
I compared that with the Catholic contemporary
which is Father Adolf Tanqueray's The Spiritual


467
0:47:7,45 --> 0:47:12,77
Life: A Treatise On Ascetical And Mystical
Theology. And it's so interesting when you


468
0:47:12,77 --> 0:47:16,84
look at the two and you look at many of these
things - because there's some Jewish books


469
0:47:16,84 --> 0:47:23,5
that I'd like to mention as well - that they're
just like different sides of the same coin.


470
0:47:23,5 --> 0:47:28,42
There might be a few different terms used
but it's the same idea - they go through the


471
0:47:28,42 --> 0:47:37,0
purification of the soul through the virtues.


472
0:47:37,0 --> 0:47:38,83
So what are the seven deadly sins?


473
0:47:38,83 --> 0:47:43,5
They are gluttony, lust, greed, pride,
sloth, vanity, and avarice.


474
0:47:43,5 --> 0:47:47,0
And the seven virtues which counterbalance
the seven deadly sins


475
0:47:47,0 --> 0:47:51,77
would be prudence, justice, fortitude,
temperance, and faith, hope, and love.


476
0:47:51,77 --> 0:47:56,109
And love is also charity - and faith, hope,
and love are in the area that's considered


477
0:47:56,109 --> 0:48:1,26
supernatural virtues, as well. If you want
to talk about how to attain to the virtues


478
0:48:1,26 --> 0:48:8,26
and to discard some of the vices, you have
to really take a close self-examination of


479
0:48:8,26 --> 0:48:12,99
yourself, and spiritual reading is one of
the ways that you do this because that's how


480
0:48:12,99 --> 0:48:18,369
you make yourself aware of things, because
many of the vices we have are so habitual


481
0:48:18,369 --> 0:48:23,7
that we would never see it in ourselves. We
might see in someone else but not in ourselves.


482
0:48:23,7 --> 0:48:27,57
So in order to attain those virtues you want
to engage in the spiritual reading, the prayer,


483
0:48:27,57 --> 0:48:32,89
and the meditation, but then you also have
to practice the virtues that are opposite


484
0:48:32,89 --> 0:48:49,0
to the vices that you know you have.


485
0:48:49,0 --> 0:48:51,87
Let's say, for instance, you have an issue with lust.


486
0:48:51,87 --> 0:48:57,67
You're going to need some temperance.
If you have a problem with greed, you're going


487
0:48:57,67 --> 0:49:4,92
to need to experience the virtue of justice in order
to be more willing to part with your goods.


488
0:49:4,92 --> 0:49:16,0
If you have a vice of greed, then you have to
become mindful of that and you have to give.


489
0:49:16,0 --> 0:49:21,42
Greedy people don't like to give.
So if you turn it around and you start giving,


490
0:49:21,42 --> 0:49:26,65
you can loosen that up a bit, and the hope
will be that at some point you're no longer


491
0:49:26,65 --> 0:49:30,65
that greedy type person because you're
giving. If it's gluttony, again, you have


492
0:49:30,65 --> 0:49:32,42
to back off from the table.


493
0:49:32,42 --> 0:49:35,72
For those of us who, when we start
realizing that we have


494
0:49:35,72 --> 0:49:41,99
some failings - because I've had a lot - and
I have been shown all of them and I'm sure


495
0:49:41,99 --> 0:49:49,19
there's more to come. When you see them there's
a tendency to feel ashamed of yourself. I'll


496
0:49:49,19 --> 0:49:55,79
never forget the moment when I got to see
my vanity through the eyes of God. It was


497
0:49:55,79 --> 0:50:2,79
so profoundly humbling in the sense of I saw
vanity in all its ugliness. Everything I had


498
0:50:2,79 --> 0:50:8,77
ever done up to that point in my life, including
the things that were good, were all done


499
0:50:8,77 --> 0:50:15,64
for the wrong reason, because they all had
some kind of self-serving reason behind it.


500
0:50:15,64 --> 0:50:18,28
Whether it's to make you do something good
for someone else to make yourself to feel


501
0:50:18,28 --> 0:50:24,48
better, or you do something that's good but
you're doing it because it'll make you look


502
0:50:24,48 --> 0:50:31,19
good... you do, whatever it is, some kind of
self-serving reason. That was really a big


503
0:50:31,19 --> 0:50:36,82
turning point for me - it took me about a
month to recover from it. And I have been


504
0:50:36,82 --> 0:50:41,869
told many times by my angels in the spirit,
"This is a time we want you to apply Buddhist


505
0:50:41,869 --> 0:50:46,0
principles because otherwise we're going to
waste too much time with you in shame, where


506
0:50:46,0 --> 0:50:54,609
we want you to understand this as a fetter,
this is something holding you back." Christianity


507
0:50:54,609 --> 0:50:59,74
has it right - it's very correct - it's just
that Buddhism takes it more from an intellectual


508
0:50:59,74 --> 0:51:7,45
standpoint, and that makes it a little quicker
because rather than spending a lot of time


509
0:51:7,45 --> 0:51:11,5
thinking about how ashamed we are of what
we've done, we say, well, this is a fetter,


510
0:51:11,5 --> 0:51:17,41
this is a hindrance, this is keeping me
from moving up towards the love that is God


511
0:51:17,41 --> 0:51:21,0
so I'm going to let these things fall away.


512
0:51:21,0 --> 0:51:23,91
When the Bhagavad Gita, like other Hindu texts,


513
0:51:23,91 --> 0:51:30,27
talks about this yogic practice of simplifying
our lives, focusing, getting our bodies in


514
0:51:30,27 --> 0:51:36,22
order, our morality in order, our spiritual
practice in order, it can at first sound very


515
0:51:36,22 --> 0:51:41,14
complicated, it can sound as if there's
so many things to do. But, generally speaking,


516
0:51:41,14 --> 0:51:48,18
it really is an effort to stop doing things,
stop worrying about things, stop needing things...


517
0:51:48,18 --> 0:51:55,619
physically, mentally, psychologically coming
into a simpler and simpler state where one


518
0:51:55,619 --> 0:52:1,66
is confronting and being confronted by ultimate
reality. And because traditions like that


519
0:52:1,66 --> 0:52:7,339
of Hinduism and the Bhagavad Gita believe
that one finds one's joy in the presence


520
0:52:7,339 --> 0:52:15,17
of the divine, ultimately being happy, rejoicing
in life, finding peace, come down to uncluttering


521
0:52:15,17 --> 0:52:20,67
one's life, doing away with the things
that stand in our way and our obstacles and


522
0:52:20,67 --> 0:52:25,849
coming to that simple presence of ourselves
and the divine. Once one gets there, this


523
0:52:25,849 --> 0:52:31,88
is what we are made for, this is who we are.
And in that moment, we find the joy of our


524
0:52:31,88 --> 0:53:12,8
life, we find the bliss - and there's no
reason ever to leave that condition.


525
0:53:12,8 --> 0:53:18,46
The most difficult part of my experience was not
the hellish part that I experienced to get


526
0:53:18,46 --> 0:53:26,4
to the good part - that was insignificant
compared to what Jesus told me about God's


527
0:53:26,4 --> 0:53:33,4
disappointment with this world because it's
a whole lot bigger than me. The human race


528
0:53:33,4 --> 0:53:40,869
has failed miserably in what God's hope and
expectation was what we can be. Granted, God


529
0:53:40,869 --> 0:53:47,15
put us in a very challenging world - this
world is not easy - but the world that God


530
0:53:47,15 --> 0:53:52,9
wants, and that God will get in the future...
it's going to happen because it's what God


531
0:53:52,9 --> 0:54:0,49
wants, and God gets what God wants - one way
or another. That world is going to come about


532
0:54:0,49 --> 0:54:6,49
and it's so different than the world we have.
God doesn't like the idea of propelling bits


533
0:54:6,49 --> 0:54:12,2
of metal through exploding gases into each
other's guts to prove that you're right and


534
0:54:12,2 --> 0:54:18,0
they're wrong. God doesn't like the idea that
a small portion of the planet has so much


535
0:54:18,0 --> 0:54:23,99
resources and meanwhile there are people in
the world who literally don't have enough


536
0:54:23,99 --> 0:54:27,72
to eat, don't have enough clothes to wear,
don't have enough shelter to keep themselves


537
0:54:27,72 --> 0:54:33,22
dry when it rains. They don't have the minimal
resources for survival. And when they show


538
0:54:33,22 --> 0:54:39,2
those miserable pictures of them on T.V. - it's
like, "Change the channel, don't bore me


539
0:54:39,2 --> 0:54:41,0
with the starving children."


540
0:54:41,0 --> 0:54:44,75
I remember I went to a church
to speak many years ago and


541
0:54:44,75 --> 0:54:50,339
the pastor told me that he has a problem with
his congregation because they're rich - and


542
0:54:50,339 --> 0:54:58,5
because they're rich they don't believe
they commit sin. So it's a challenge for


543
0:54:58,5 --> 0:55:2,7
him to teach them certain things because
they think, 'Oh, I don't do that.' But


544
0:55:2,7 --> 0:55:5,0
no, they can do it just like anybody else.


545
0:55:5,0 --> 0:55:8,27
We don't realize how dumb it is that we focus


546
0:55:8,27 --> 0:55:15,27
so much on mortal, impermanent things in this
world. We focus on how we look on the outside,


547
0:55:15,27 --> 0:55:21,3
whether or not we have enough degrees, whether
or not we make enough money... and you know


548
0:55:21,3 --> 0:55:27,13
the only thing that matters when you're on
that deathbed is the people you love and whether


549
0:55:27,13 --> 0:55:35,63
or not you loved well, whether or not you
actually improved and progressed in your spiritual


550
0:55:35,63 --> 0:55:39,0
life, if you moved closer to God
rather than further away.


551
0:55:39,0 --> 0:55:40,75
People who want more and more


552
0:55:40,75 --> 0:55:46,1
things are trying to make up for an inner
feeling of inadequacy and unfulfillment by


553
0:55:46,1 --> 0:55:52,28
piling on outer things, but it never works,
right? And then as they do that, they get


554
0:55:52,28 --> 0:55:55,349
angry with others because they think that
they want to take things from other people


555
0:55:55,349 --> 0:55:58,19
so they imagine that other people
want to take things from them.


556
0:55:58,19 --> 0:56:0,829
Living from your center, knowing who


557
0:56:0,829 --> 0:56:6,54
you are, having a sense that you are living
what God created you to live is a pearl of


558
0:56:6,54 --> 0:56:13,6
great price. And it can't be bought and no
one or nothing can take it away from you.


559
0:56:13,6 --> 0:56:18,31
Careers come and go. Money can come and go.
There's nothing wrong with money. Money can


560
0:56:18,31 --> 0:56:24,44
do great things, but it's a poor master.
It's a great tool, terrible master. We need


561
0:56:24,44 --> 0:56:29,52
more to ground our sense of worth than money.
When people live too far from their center


562
0:56:29,52 --> 0:56:33,56
you can tell, because they're always looking
to be entertained and distracted from the


563
0:56:33,56 --> 0:56:37,0
emptiness they find inside.


564
0:56:37,0 --> 0:56:41,8
The Buddhist legend of coming to the
guide and saying, "I'm suffering...


565
0:56:41,8 --> 0:56:45,5
I can't deal with it." "Okay, well, I want
to help you. This is what you do: Go find


566
0:56:45,5 --> 0:56:49,79
a home that has known no suffering." So the
person goes off to the home and says, "I'm


567
0:56:49,79 --> 0:56:53,57
looking for a home where there's no suffering."
"Oh, no, that's not here." Tells him all the


568
0:56:53,57 --> 0:56:56,599
suffering, and the person starts working with
them... then goes to the next home, same thing,


569
0:56:56,599 --> 0:56:58,46
works with them. Before they know it, they
forget about their own suffering.


570
0:56:58,46 --> 0:57:4,48
As the Dalai Lama says, if you want to be happier
yourself then make other people happy, and forget


571
0:57:4,48 --> 0:57:9,45
about being happy yourself. Because as long as
you're worried about being happy yourself, you'll


572
0:57:9,45 --> 0:57:13,2
be unhappy because you'll measure how
happy you are and then you'll not think


573
0:57:13,2 --> 0:57:17,38
it's happy enough. You'll want another
ice cream cone, you'll want another extra


574
0:57:17,38 --> 0:57:21,72
thing. But if you forget about how happy you
are and you're just trying to make another


575
0:57:21,72 --> 0:57:26,89
person happy, then without even trying you'll
be happy. So as the Dalai Lama says, if you're


576
0:57:26,89 --> 0:57:30,89
going to be selfish seeking your own happiness,


577
0:57:30,89 --> 0:57:34,75
at least be a wise selfish and affect
other being's happiness.


578
0:57:34,75 --> 0:57:41,53
Good deeds done well encourage more good
deeds done well. A lot of these


579
0:57:41,53 --> 0:57:50,91
kinds of things we don't realize the astronomical
effect it has when we try to bring God into


580
0:57:50,91 --> 0:57:57,96
what we are doing and we try to keep in mind
the well-being of everyone involved and everyone


581
0:57:57,96 --> 0:58:4,44
around us that others mimic that and they start
doing the same. And so it multiplies, and


582
0:58:4,44 --> 0:58:7,0
you bring more and more light into this world.


583
0:58:7,0 --> 0:58:11,63
Every time there's an act of goodness, of


584
0:58:11,63 --> 0:58:15,25
bringing God's light in the world, you're
bringing healing. There's a wonderful traditional


585
0:58:15,25 --> 0:58:20,0
phrase in Jewish mysticism, it's very much
used in normative Jewish practice today, it's


586
0:58:20,0 --> 0:58:26,339
Tikkun Olam. Literally, it means to repair
the world. The acts that we can do on a daily


587
0:58:26,339 --> 0:58:32,7
basis that help bring healing to the world.
You're not commanded by God to fix everything...


588
0:58:32,7 --> 0:58:39,2
but you are commanded by God to keep trying.


589
0:58:39,2 --> 0:58:42,1
When Jesus told me that my fate was to come


590
0:58:42,1 --> 0:58:46,0
back in this world and that I was not going
to go to heaven - which is what I wanted to do,


591
0:58:46,0 --> 0:58:53,359
I argued as forcibly as I could to not send
me back here. I told Him that the world was


592
0:58:53,359 --> 0:58:58,52
full of evil, it was a terrible place. And
He said, "Yeah, there's a lot of evil in the


593
0:58:58,52 --> 0:59:1,839
world and there's a lot of bad stuff in the
world, but there's a lot of good and a lot


594
0:59:1,839 --> 0:59:7,56
of loving people." He said, "What you
are in your heart is what you're going


595
0:59:7,56 --> 0:59:13,3
to seek. If you seek hate, you'll find hate,
and you are hate. If you seek love,


596
0:59:13,3 --> 0:59:19,98
you'll find love and you'll be love. If you
seek kindness, you'll find kindness, and you'll


597
0:59:19,98 --> 0:59:26,68
be kindness." And so we have to be it, and
seek it, and then we will find it. So I said,


598
0:59:26,68 --> 0:59:35,21
"But what's the point of sending me back?
Why would you want me to go back to that world?


599
0:59:35,21 --> 0:59:38,269
If you really loved me you wouldn't send me
back to that place." And He said, "I need


600
0:59:38,269 --> 0:59:42,56
you. I need you back there." I said, "You
need me to do what?" And He said, "I need


601
0:59:42,56 --> 0:59:47,47
you to change the world." I said, "Whoa, whoa,
whoa... I'm not going to change the world!"


602
0:59:47,47 --> 0:59:55,79
I said,"I don't even know if I could change
me. I don't know if I can be what you want


603
0:59:55,79 --> 1:0:3,99
me to be, be the loving, kind person you
want me to be and asking me to be the Savior


604
1:0:3,99 --> 1:0:10,2
of the world." He didn't say that, I said
it... I was sort of exaggerating my role. He


605
1:0:10,2 --> 1:0:16,26
said, "No, that's really what I want you to
do. I want you to change the world." "That's


606
1:0:16,26 --> 1:0:23,5
crazy," I said, "people that try and change
the world come out to a bad end. We're talking


607
1:0:23,5 --> 1:0:29,19
about Stalin and Hitler and Genghis Khan... they
all wanted to change the world and they were


608
1:0:29,19 --> 1:0:34,0
all megalomaniacs. I don't want to go back
and be a megalomaniac." He said, "No, no,


609
1:0:34,0 --> 1:0:42,0
no... you got it all wrong. They were bad,
they were megalomaniacs. That's not how I


610
1:0:42,0 --> 1:0:44,77
want you to change the world." And I said,
"Well, how do want me to change the world?"


611
1:0:44,77 --> 1:0:52,39
He said, "Love somebody." And I said, "Okay...
but what's the rest of the plan?" He said,


612
1:0:52,39 --> 1:0:57,26
"No, that's the whole plan." And I said, "If
I go back and love someone... that changes


613
1:0:57,26 --> 1:1:1,25
the world?" And He said, "That's the plan.
That's it." I said, "What's the rest of the


614
1:1:1,25 --> 1:1:5,43
plan?" He said, "That's the whole plan, there
is no more. Just love somebody." And I said,


615
1:1:5,43 --> 1:1:9,0
"If I love somebody, how in the world will
that change anything?" And He said, "If you


616
1:1:9,0 --> 1:1:15,69
love someone, really truly love them, they
will love someone, and that person will love


617
1:1:15,69 --> 1:1:19,74
someone, and that person will love someone."
And me, being a clever fellow I was, I said,


618
1:1:19,74 --> 1:1:25,359
"Yeah, and then they get run over by a truck
and that's the end of the plan." And He said,


619
1:1:25,359 --> 1:1:32,359
"No... because I never said you're the only
one." He said, "There's a lot." And I said,


620
1:1:32,359 --> 1:1:39,18
"Well, how many." He said, "Millions. Millions
of people are the instrument of change." And


621
1:1:39,18 --> 1:1:44,8
I said, "Okay, but there are a lot of trucks
down there and a lot of bad stuff can happen


622
1:1:44,8 --> 1:1:49,359
to thwart the millions of people trying to
love somebody." And He said, "Yeah, but I


623
1:1:49,359 --> 1:1:55,24
have a backup." I said, "What's the backup?"
And He said, "Angels." And I said, "So you're


624
1:1:55,24 --> 1:1:58,5
going to bring the angels into this?" And
He said, "The angels are already in it, they're


625
1:1:58,5 --> 1:2:6,38
already intervening." He said, "So I got millions
of people, I got angels beyond counting all


626
1:2:6,38 --> 1:2:11,89
trying to inspire people, encourage people,
help people." He said, "This is God's Will.


627
1:2:11,89 --> 1:2:17,56
It is inevitable. It's going to happen one
way or another. It has to happen because


628
1:2:17,56 --> 1:2:24,0
it's what God wants." And I said, "Well, when
you put it that way... when you put it as like


629
1:2:24,0 --> 1:2:28,859
God's going to make it happen... sure, I'd
be happy to be part of it!" So anyways, this


630
1:2:28,859 --> 1:2:37,55
is my interpretation: You're either part of
the program or you're against it. There's


631
1:2:37,55 --> 1:2:43,78
no longer an opportunity to sit on the
fence and say, oh, look at the foolish loving


632
1:2:43,78 --> 1:2:48,2
people doing the loving thing. Good luck
to them and the Boston Red Sox. And look at


633
1:2:48,2 --> 1:2:55,1
the bad people going around fermenting hate
and fear and strife in the world. Good


634
1:2:55,1 --> 1:3:2,46
luck to them. You can't do that anymore. You're
either in the program, which is God's program


635
1:3:2,46 --> 1:3:12,849
of turning this world into a loving and kind
place or you're against the program. And


636
1:3:12,849 --> 1:3:17,0
there's nothing in between.


637
1:3:17,0 --> 1:3:20,52
We are told that you can't even go
to sleep if your neighbor's


638
1:3:20,52 --> 1:3:26,119
hungry and you have food. The Prophet Muhammad,
peace be upon him, told us that our neighbors


639
1:3:26,119 --> 1:3:30,78
are forty houses in front of us, forty houses
in back of us, and forty houses on the side


640
1:3:30,78 --> 1:3:37,78
of us. And he told us that he received so
many instructions from Almighty about the


641
1:3:37,78 --> 1:3:41,4
neighbor that he thought that the neighbor
was going to actually be in the will. That


642
1:3:41,4 --> 1:3:44,19
you have to actually put the neighbor in the
will. So he told us to treat our neighbor


643
1:3:44,19 --> 1:3:46,99
as we treat ourselves.


644
1:3:46,99 --> 1:3:50,99
How do I love God in this life?
I don't do it by putting on all


645
1:3:50,99 --> 1:3:55,27
kinds of fancy clothes with jewels and standing
and waving my hand and saying, "I love God."


646
1:3:55,27 --> 1:3:59,72
I don't do it by standing in a pulpit and
saying, "I love God." I don't do it by wearing


647
1:3:59,72 --> 1:4:4,76
a button that says, "I love God and He loves
me." I do it by going to the soup kitchen


648
1:4:4,76 --> 1:4:11,0
down the street. I do it by buying a coat
for the guy I know is cold. I do it by taking


649
1:4:11,0 --> 1:4:19,0
care of those who are the most broken in life
and loving them. How do you get to heaven?


650
1:4:19,0 --> 1:4:22,719
By loving God... and by loving Him in my neighbor.


651
1:4:22,719 --> 1:4:25,319
We can't journey back to God without taking


652
1:4:25,319 --> 1:4:29,49
into account our obligation to our neighbor.
It's not just about me and God. It's about


653
1:4:29,49 --> 1:4:36,27
me and the whole human community and how together
this earth can be more like the kingdom of


654
1:4:36,27 --> 1:4:54,83
God, which is a community of justice, of love, of
peace. No one's God says, 'Hate your neighbor.'


655
1:4:54,83 --> 1:4:59,79
Some fanatics in every religion distort,
perhaps, but rightly understood


656
1:4:59,79 --> 1:5:4,58
the core of all religions is a journey of
love. A journey toward our fellow human beings


657
1:5:4,58 --> 1:5:6,44
and toward God not away from them.


658
1:5:6,44 --> 1:5:10,14
A lot of the times God is saying, "Just be. Just be


659
1:5:10,14 --> 1:5:16,69
there with that person. You don't you have
to fix them. They're not broken. If they


660
1:5:16,69 --> 1:5:20,66
got brokenness I'll fix them, you just love
them the way they are... just love them the


661
1:5:20,66 --> 1:5:27,66
way they are." I've been with drug users,
prostitutes, alcoholics, murderers... I did


662
1:5:27,66 --> 1:5:31,65
a ministry with a guy on death row for a long
time... and God was saying, "You don't have


663
1:5:31,65 --> 1:5:37,25
to preach to these people, just love them.
I'll take care of the rest."


664
1:5:37,25 --> 1:5:40,5
Love your neighbor as yourself,
everything else is commentary.


665
1:5:40,5 --> 1:5:44,8
If you're really serious about that, you're
starting in a position of love.


666
1:5:44,8 --> 1:5:48,409
If everyone just started with that,
that one thing, imagine


667
1:5:48,409 --> 1:5:56,5
how different the world would be. "I love
you. Now let's talk."


668
1:5:56,5 --> 1:5:59,0
In the Hindu religious traditions


669
1:5:59,0 --> 1:6:3,69
there is a very universal sense
that we are all on the path, and that all


670
1:6:3,69 --> 1:6:10,9
beings are destined toward a higher development,
toward true knowledge, toward ultimately bliss,


671
1:6:10,9 --> 1:6:15,49
in union with the ultimate reality, or as
that reality, or with God. And I think the


672
1:6:15,49 --> 1:6:21,78
good Hindu teacher can see a crowd before
her or him and realize that each person here


673
1:6:21,78 --> 1:6:28,89
is on the spiritual path, has the same destiny,
and yet needs to be allowed to travel at his


674
1:6:28,89 --> 1:6:33,28
or her own pace. And trying to make somebody
travel at somebody else's pace and speed


675
1:6:33,28 --> 1:6:38,2
things up or slow things down only leads to
unhappiness for everyone. So everyone is on


676
1:6:38,2 --> 1:6:42,67
the journey and yet people are at different
stages, just as we tend to be at different


677
1:6:42,67 --> 1:6:45,5
stages of life depending on
our age or circumstances.


678
1:6:45,5 --> 1:6:48,599
The goal for all of us is that we're trying


679
1:6:48,599 --> 1:6:54,5
to get to God, and the only way we can do
that is by becoming more and more holy. Does


680
1:6:54,5 --> 1:6:59,9
that mean that any of us are going to achieve
perfection in this life? Mm-mmm (no). But


681
1:6:59,9 --> 1:7:6,16
we can become more aware and even just having
the humility to realize who we really are


682
1:7:6,16 --> 1:7:9,0
in relation to God is a really good place to start.


683
1:7:9,0 --> 1:7:11,55
I feel that as we are trying to


684
1:7:11,55 --> 1:7:17,869
move forward and I think that the church is
trying to recognize the fact that they need


685
1:7:17,869 --> 1:7:24,64
to open up and change some of their old methods.
I feel that a lot of them were looking at


686
1:7:24,64 --> 1:7:30,69
it from the perspective that devils and demons
and these things were something from the stone


687
1:7:30,69 --> 1:7:34,5
ages and it really didn't encompass our world.


688
1:7:34,5 --> 1:7:36,7
The book of Revelation is a very unique piece


689
1:7:36,7 --> 1:7:43,53
of literature because it's a kind of a literature...
apocalyptic literature, that was very popular


690
1:7:43,53 --> 1:7:48,55
in those years immediately after the death
and resurrection of Christ in the early days


691
1:7:48,55 --> 1:7:55,46
of the church, and it was not necessarily
meant as a prediction of the way things are


692
1:7:55,46 --> 1:8:4,63
going to happen in a physical, historical
way. So to say that, in effect, we each participate


693
1:8:4,63 --> 1:8:10,3
in our own kind of cosmic battle, our own
internal battle between light and darkness,


694
1:8:10,3 --> 1:8:15,3
well, that's the theme of everything I've
saying along the way, it's true. And so one


695
1:8:15,3 --> 1:8:21,0
can see this kind of cosmic battle as simply
being a description of what's going on inside


696
1:8:21,0 --> 1:8:22,5
of each of us.


697
1:8:22,5 --> 1:8:29,13
I think the very idea of the end of the
world is one of those concepts


698
1:8:29,13 --> 1:8:35,479
that we have in mind without ever really knowing
what to make of it in terms of history. We


699
1:8:35,479 --> 1:8:44,369
do have a sense that everything ends... summer
ends, winter ends, the day ends. We know through


700
1:8:44,369 --> 1:8:48,469
the experience of death that so many people
we love, their lives come to an end. And I


701
1:8:48,469 --> 1:8:53,989
think we can expand that and say the world,
too, will come to an end. It may be that the


702
1:8:53,989 --> 1:9:1,719
Armageddon or the last judgment matters most
in terms of my life, my facing up to my destiny,


703
1:9:1,719 --> 1:9:6,17
my facing up to the fact that some day this
life will be over and there are basic choices


704
1:9:6,17 --> 1:9:8,87
to be made about to live
in the face of that reality.


705
1:9:8,87 --> 1:9:11,17
Judgment is a little different than


706
1:9:11,17 --> 1:9:16,669
people think because people think of judgment
as like an external group or individual saying,


707
1:9:16,669 --> 1:9:21,799
"You're good, you're bad." That's not the way
it works. Our judgment is what our hearts are.


708
1:9:21,799 --> 1:9:30,559
When I had my life review... I could summarize
my life review simply by saying I was judged


709
1:9:30,559 --> 1:9:37,59
entirely by the quality of my relationships,
of whether my relationships were loving


710
1:9:37,59 --> 1:9:44,539
and caring and compassionate and kind, or
whether my relationships with other people


711
1:9:44,539 --> 1:9:51,539
were me being manipulative, and greedy, and
self-centered. And, unfortunately, I was the


712
1:9:51,539 --> 1:9:54,43
latter and not the former.


713
1:9:54,43 --> 1:9:58,13
One of the biggest issues that I see in
the world today is too


714
1:9:58,13 --> 1:10:4,539
many people not realizing that there is a
function and a purpose for us being here, and


715
1:10:4,539 --> 1:10:9,309
that function was told to me in a near-death
experience I had with Jesus Christ, and it's


716
1:10:9,309 --> 1:12:9,309
very simple: We're supposed to go
from selfishness to selflessness.
