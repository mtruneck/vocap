2
0:0:3,276 --> 0:0:8,54
-We actually came specifically
from Ohio for spring break.


3
0:0:8,54 --> 0:0:11,8
MATT: When you come from
Tennessee, Georgia, South


4
0:0:11,8 --> 0:0:14,44
Carolina, any Southern state,
Daytona Beach might as well be


5
0:0:14,44 --> 0:0:15,84
the south of France
for these people.


6
0:0:15,84 --> 0:0:17,33
SEAN BISHOP: The way I've always
described Daytona Beach


7
0:0:17,33 --> 0:0:20,18
to people is it reminds me of
somebody who fell in love with


8
0:0:20,18 --> 0:0:22,18
a hooker and is trying to
turn her into a lady.


9
0:0:22,18 --> 0:0:23,62
She's always going
to be a whore.


10
0:0:23,62 --> 0:0:40,91



11
0:0:40,91 --> 0:0:43,455
On a good spring break night,
we'll have well over 100 girls


12
0:0:43,455 --> 0:0:43,77
dancing here.


13
0:0:43,77 --> 0:0:46,515
NADIA: By the time midnight
hits, this place is crazy.


14
0:0:46,515 --> 0:0:48,49
SEAN BISHOP: At first, when we
started letting the spring


15
0:0:48,49 --> 0:0:50,63
breakers in, the girls looked at
them like they were a bunch


16
0:0:50,63 --> 0:0:53,2
of young kids without any money
until they find out they


17
0:0:53,2 --> 0:0:54,8
were spending money.


18
0:0:54,8 --> 0:0:55,52
And now they embrace it.


19
0:0:55,52 --> 0:0:57,63
And the unique thing about it
is if you look at the age


20
0:0:57,63 --> 0:1:0,3
group, our average dancer
is a girl in her


21
0:1:0,3 --> 0:1:1,47
young 20s, late teens.


22
0:1:1,47 --> 0:1:3,73
NADIA: I've had girls say
they've walked out of here


23
0:1:3,73 --> 0:1:4,59
with $2,000.


24
0:1:4,59 --> 0:1:7,23
I mean, crazy, off-the-hook
amounts.


25
0:1:7,23 --> 0:1:9,108
What happens in Daytona
stays in Daytona.


26
0:1:9,108 --> 0:1:17,92



27
0:1:17,92 --> 0:1:21,2
DAVE: Daytona is just the Vegas
of Florida, because it's


28
0:1:21,2 --> 0:1:24,2
so trashy as it is that people
come down here for spring


29
0:1:24,2 --> 0:1:26,319
break, leave all their
morals at home.


30
0:1:26,319 --> 0:1:30,151



31
0:1:30,151 --> 0:1:32,38
SEAN BISHOP: You go to bed one
night, and you wake up and


32
0:1:32,38 --> 0:1:34,46
there's an extra 200,000
people in town.


33
0:1:34,46 --> 0:1:35,75
So the place just explodes.


34
0:1:35,75 --> 0:1:40,37



35
0:1:40,37 --> 0:1:43,13
MATT: It's just a bunch of
people who came to one place


36
0:1:43,13 --> 0:1:46,25
with good weather to just get
hammered and have sex.


37
0:1:46,25 --> 0:1:47,77
RANDY PHILLIPS: Dirtona
Beach, man.


38
0:1:47,77 --> 0:1:49,73
That's the name that sticks.


39
0:1:49,73 --> 0:1:50,98
That is Dirtona.


40
0:1:50,98 --> 0:1:57,95



41
0:1:57,95 --> 0:2:1,41
MATT: If you spend five minutes
in a hotel room during


42
0:2:1,41 --> 0:2:4,32
spring break, you have to wonder
all the atrocities that


43
0:2:4,32 --> 0:2:5,1
are going on.


44
0:2:5,1 --> 0:2:6,73
All the hotel room
doors are open.


45
0:2:6,73 --> 0:2:9,52
There's a beer bong in every
room, people having sex as


46
0:2:9,52 --> 0:2:11,85
loudly as possible, belongings
everywhere.


47
0:2:11,85 --> 0:2:13,7
Like people just left
their shit, and


48
0:2:13,7 --> 0:2:14,95
they're down on the beach.


49
0:2:14,95 --> 0:2:17,35
There could be a whale that just
washed up on the beach


50
0:2:17,35 --> 0:2:19,55
and is decaying and
smells like shit.


51
0:2:19,55 --> 0:2:21,225
If there's people around it,
they'll flock to it and


52
0:2:21,225 --> 0:2:22,35
they'll get hammered by it.


53
0:2:22,35 --> 0:2:25,41
RANDY PHILLIPS: These two girls
were totally going at it


54
0:2:25,41 --> 0:2:26,66
right on one of my mop sinks.


55
0:2:26,66 --> 0:2:27,48
And I literally walked in.


56
0:2:27,48 --> 0:2:28,815
I was like, are you
women serious?


57
0:2:28,815 --> 0:2:31,28
Do you realize what I
put in that sink?


58
0:2:31,28 --> 0:2:33,53
And they're totally going
to town on each other.


59
0:2:33,53 --> 0:2:36,57
MATT: The sweetest girls
back home are the


60
0:2:36,57 --> 0:2:40,4
craziest girls down here.


61
0:2:40,4 --> 0:2:42,85
You could definitely have at
least two girls every night.


62
0:2:42,85 --> 0:2:44,91
SEAN BISHOP: The whole "Girls
Gone Wild" thing started here


63
0:2:44,91 --> 0:2:46,7
in Daytona Beach, Florida.


64
0:2:46,7 --> 0:2:48,255
I mean, if you look at it, it
is the perfect environment.


65
0:2:48,255 --> 0:2:50,52
MATT: These girls don't
care what's going on.


66
0:2:50,52 --> 0:2:52,61
You can pass them to your
buddies even though they know


67
0:2:52,61 --> 0:2:53,86
what has happened.


68
0:2:53,86 --> 0:2:57,666



69
0:2:57,666 --> 0:3:1,12
DAVE: It's a really great town
to be a drug dealer, because


70
0:3:1,12 --> 0:3:2,93
everyone's on drugs.


71
0:3:2,93 --> 0:3:4,68
Everyone's a customer.


72
0:3:4,68 --> 0:3:7,6
As a spring breaker in Daytona
Beach, you're looking to get


73
0:3:7,6 --> 0:3:9,6
those things that you don't
think you can get at home.


74
0:3:9,6 --> 0:3:13,66
Recently, it has been more
meth, ecstasy, coke.


75
0:3:13,66 --> 0:3:15,18
Pills are really big now.


76
0:3:15,18 --> 0:3:17,73
And the pills are cheap down
here, so they know


77
0:3:17,73 --> 0:3:18,63
they can get them.


78
0:3:18,63 --> 0:3:21,85
Mostly you can sell them
whatever you want.


79
0:3:21,85 --> 0:3:22,97
Ripping them off is real easy.


80
0:3:22,97 --> 0:3:24,82
Quality doesn't have
to be there.


81
0:3:24,82 --> 0:3:26,98
Sometimes you can just take
the money and run.


82
0:3:26,98 --> 0:3:31,26
Sometimes you can give them a
bad bag, a lot of cut, bad


83
0:3:31,26 --> 0:3:32,94
weed, tell them it's
good weed.


84
0:3:32,94 --> 0:3:35,145
Hook them real easy, because
they don't have a lot of


85
0:3:35,145 --> 0:3:36,455
options when they're
on vacation.


86
0:3:36,455 --> 0:3:45,532



87
0:3:45,532 --> 0:3:48,315
SCOTT EDWARDS: Fifteen or 20
years ago, spring break would


88
0:3:48,315 --> 0:3:50,88
bring about $100 million
into this economy.


89
0:3:50,88 --> 0:3:52,39
We have MTV.


90
0:3:52,39 --> 0:3:55,18
We had the Miss Hawaiian Tropic
International pageant.


91
0:3:55,18 --> 0:3:58,39
STEVE PENDLEND: We had 250,000
to 300,000 kids for an


92
0:3:58,39 --> 0:3:59,88
eight-week period of time.


93
0:3:59,88 --> 0:4:4,25
-We would do, I would say, on
an average, anywhere from 30


94
0:4:4,25 --> 0:4:7,2
to 45 tattoos a day.


95
0:4:7,2 --> 0:4:9,21
It was really good for
everything, all the way down


96
0:4:9,21 --> 0:4:12,26
to gas stations and
restaurants.


97
0:4:12,26 --> 0:4:13,96
I don't see where all
the problem--


98
0:4:13,96 --> 0:4:15,405
what they tried to say was
such a big problem.


99
0:4:15,405 --> 0:4:21,93



100
0:4:21,93 --> 0:4:24,7
-So everybody thinks, oh, it's
spring break, it's party time.


101
0:4:24,7 --> 0:4:25,78
In reality, there's another
element that


102
0:4:25,78 --> 0:4:26,86
comes into this city.


103
0:4:26,86 --> 0:4:27,59
They're out there
selling drugs.


104
0:4:27,59 --> 0:4:28,445
They're looking to do rapes.


105
0:4:28,445 --> 0:4:29,77
They're looking to
do burglaries.


106
0:4:29,77 --> 0:4:30,77
They're looking to
hurt somebody.


107
0:4:30,77 --> 0:4:34,506
DAVE: There's nothing really
to do but do drugs, so it's


108
0:4:34,506 --> 0:4:35,941
right up someone's alley
if they want to get


109
0:4:35,941 --> 0:4:39,2
fucked up all the time.


110
0:4:39,2 --> 0:4:42,503
MATT: If this was mid-October,
the owners would


111
0:4:42,503 --> 0:4:43,14
just kill us all.


112
0:4:43,14 --> 0:4:46,61
But it's during spring break,
so they just let the


113
0:4:46,61 --> 0:4:49,8
ridiculousness happen.


114
0:4:49,8 --> 0:4:54,12
SCOTT EDWARDS: We are marketing
to America's best


115
0:4:54,12 --> 0:4:56,92
and brightest young people.


116
0:4:56,92 --> 0:4:58,3
I don't see what
the problem is.


117
0:4:58,3 --> 0:5:1,76
RANDY PHILLIPS: They want to
make it this pristine, clean,


118
0:5:1,76 --> 0:5:5,7
clear, no vacationers, no
whatever, family town.


119
0:5:5,7 --> 0:5:7,24
STEVE PENDLEND: They didn't
replace it with any business.


120
0:5:7,24 --> 0:5:10,5
SCOTT EDWARDS: The newspaper did
an expose about two months


121
0:5:10,5 --> 0:5:14,43
ago in talking about all the
closed businesses on A1A.


122
0:5:14,43 --> 0:5:16,645
And I think they
counted up 205.


123
0:5:16,645 --> 0:5:18,9
RANDY PHILLIPS: I hate to use
the word blight, but it has


124
0:5:18,9 --> 0:5:19,525
become a blight.


125
0:5:19,525 --> 0:5:21,71
Look at the cityscape
around you.


126
0:5:21,71 --> 0:5:24,6
It literally looks like
a bomb went off.


127
0:5:24,6 --> 0:5:25,92
This town could be
something again.


128
0:5:25,92 --> 0:5:27,51
I want it to change
for the better.


129
0:5:27,51 --> 0:5:29,85
I want to go back, not
necessarily to what it was,


130
0:5:29,85 --> 0:5:35,59
but I definitely want it to
aspire to be something better.


131
0:5:35,59 --> 0:5:39,18
But Daytona's got that unique
quality about it.


132
0:5:39,18 --> 0:5:47,132



133
0:5:47,132 --> 0:5:50,87
SCOTT EDWARDS: The college
students really took a bad rap


134
0:5:50,87 --> 0:5:52,9
in a lot of ways.


135
0:5:52,9 --> 0:5:53,67
We are still a spring
break destination.


136
0:5:53,67 --> 0:5:57,15
DAVE: More spring breakers are
starting to come back.


137
0:5:57,15 --> 0:5:58,5
Every year there's
more and more.


138
0:5:58,5 --> 0:5:59,53
SEAN BISHOP: Embrace the kids.


139
0:5:59,53 --> 0:6:0,1
Come down.


140
0:6:0,1 --> 0:6:1,12
Let them have fun.


141
0:6:1,12 --> 0:6:2,575
I mean, that's what this
town's known for.


142
0:6:2,575 --> 0:6:6,515
MATT: If spring break was to
ever class it up, I think it


143
0:6:6,515 --> 0:6:8,91
would lose the element
of freedom.


144
0:6:8,91 --> 0:8:8,91
