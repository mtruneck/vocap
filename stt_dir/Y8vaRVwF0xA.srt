HAMILTON MORRIS: Today is
Queen's Day in Amsterdam, and


4
0:0:24,48 --> 0:0:26,27
I have three containers of


5
0:0:26,27 --> 0:0:28,21
psilocybin-containing truffles.


6
0:0:28,21 --> 0:0:31,75
I'm going to start by taking
8 grams of this 15-gram


7
0:0:31,75 --> 0:0:34,52
container, because that's what
the man at the smart shop


8
0:0:34,52 --> 0:0:36,4
advised me to do.


9
0:0:36,4 --> 0:0:40,66
And then I suppose I'm going to
go out and walk around on


10
0:0:40,66 --> 0:0:43,34
Queen's Day, which is incredibly
chaotic and


11
0:0:43,34 --> 0:0:44,0
disgusting.


12
0:0:44,0 --> 0:0:48,64

place to take them.

very much at all.

0:1:11,761 --> 0:1:13,11
OK.


23
0:1:13,11 --> 0:1:32,21



24
0:1:32,21 --> 0:1:36,28
Yesterday, I arrived in
Amsterdam, doubtlessly one of


25
0:1:36,28 --> 0:1:40,515
the sickest places on Earth to
get blazed on dank nugs.


26
0:1:40,515 --> 0:1:46,335



27
0:1:46,335 --> 0:1:51,58
But my interest is not solely
confined to blazing dank nugs.


28
0:1:51,58 --> 0:1:53,74
Amsterdam is fertile ground
for all manner of


29
0:1:53,74 --> 0:1:54,99
psychoactive substance.


30
0:1:54,99 --> 0:2:1,37



31
0:2:1,37 --> 0:2:4,26
I came here to find the
psilocybe tampanensis


32
0:2:4,26 --> 0:2:8,78
sclerotium, or philosopher's
stone truffle.


33
0:2:8,78 --> 0:2:12,75
It was not until the infamous
mushroom ban of 2008 that the


34
0:2:12,75 --> 0:2:16,39
psychedelic sclerotium gained
widespread popularity, due to


35
0:2:16,39 --> 0:2:19,47
the fact that its effects and
chemical composition are


36
0:2:19,47 --> 0:2:24,15
almost indistinguishable from
the psilocybin mushroom.


37
0:2:24,15 --> 0:2:26,39
Mushrooms were once
completely legal.


38
0:2:26,39 --> 0:2:29,62
And since the early '90s, the
Netherlands led the world in


39
0:2:29,62 --> 0:2:31,84
the development of commercial
psychedelic mushroom-growing


40
0:2:31,84 --> 0:2:33,82
techniques.


41
0:2:33,82 --> 0:2:36,54
But everything changed in
2008, when the Dutch


42
0:2:36,54 --> 0:2:38,85
government banned
psilocybin-containing


43
0:2:38,85 --> 0:2:42,42
mushrooms, responding to a
number of highly publicized


44
0:2:42,42 --> 0:2:47,38
deaths misguidedly blamed
on the innocent fungus.


45
0:2:47,38 --> 0:2:51,57
Truffles escaped the ban
unscathed and hold a place


46
0:2:51,57 --> 0:2:54,55
inside the hearts of
all true Dutch.


47
0:2:54,55 --> 0:2:57,61
I am here to learn about how
these strange protuberances


48
0:2:57,61 --> 0:3:1,38
are cultivated and why they
have not been banned.


49
0:3:1,38 --> 0:3:3,76
There are no better people to
consult than the Truffle

52
0:3:8,785 --> 0:3:12,68



53
0:3:12,68 --> 0:3:16,71
I visited the brothers' farm in
Hazerwoude-Dorp, formerly


54
0:3:16,71 --> 0:3:19,223
the second-largest mushroom
farm in the Netherlands.


55

56
0:3:23,0 --> 0:3:26,21
Having survived the mushroom
ban, the Truffle Brothers now


57
0:3:26,21 --> 0:3:27,4
dominate the


58
0:3:27,4 --> 0:3:30,62

0:3:30,62 --> 0:3:34,93
I sat down with Murat and Ali to
discuss the secrets of the

ALI: First of all,
my name is Ali.


63
0:3:42,9 --> 0:3:44,3
Next to me is sitting
my brother, Murat.


64
0:3:44,3 --> 0:3:48,96
We are, in fact, known as
the Truffle Brothers.

You are here at the farm
of magictruffles.com.


66

known as magic truffles.

HAMILTON MORRIS: And how did
this company get started?


68
0:4:0,18 --> 0:4:2,4
ALI: Interesting story.


69
0:4:2,4 --> 0:4:5,61
Long story that started
somewhere around


70
0:4:5,61 --> 0:4:9,61
1993, '94, I guess.


71
0:4:9,61 --> 0:4:11,67
I learned mushroom growing
in Belgium.


72
0:4:11,67 --> 0:4:14,18
Mushrooms for eating-- normal,
white button mushrooms.


73
0:4:14,18 --> 0:4:15,65
That was my occupation before I


74
0:4:15,65 --> 0:4:17,48
started with these mushrooms.


75
0:4:17,48 --> 0:4:20,769
And so I had quite a great
network in that


76
0:4:20,769 --> 0:4:22,39
area, in that field.


77
0:4:22,39 --> 0:4:25,44
And one day, a friend of mine
comes up to me and says, look


78
0:4:25,44 --> 0:4:28,16
what I found.


79
0:4:28,16 --> 0:4:32,35
He shows me a Petri
dish with spores.


80
0:4:32,35 --> 0:4:35,76
That's interesting, what
kind of mushroom is it?


81
0:4:35,76 --> 0:4:38,33
He said, well, it's
a magic mushroom.


82
0:4:38,33 --> 0:4:40,53
And I'd never heard of it.


83
0:4:40,53 --> 0:4:42,93
So I took a closer look.


84
0:4:42,93 --> 0:4:46,48
I went to a friend of mine
who owned a laboratory, a


85
0:4:46,48 --> 0:4:50,41
mycological laboratory, and
asked him, can we do something


86
0:4:50,41 --> 0:4:51,13
with these spores?


87
0:4:51,13 --> 0:4:52,65
He says, well, let's
give it a try.


88
0:4:52,65 --> 0:4:55,75
And after two weeks, there was
one mushroom in the aquarium.


89
0:4:55,75 --> 0:4:56,81
But it was a giant mushroom.


90
0:4:56,81 --> 0:4:59,92

91
0:4:59,92 --> 0:5:1,755
this tall.

0:5:1,755 --> 0:5:3,12
And we were looking at it.


93
0:5:3,12 --> 0:5:6,14
I said, OK, let's harvest it.

HAMILTON MORRIS: And you were
operating a pizza restaurant


95
0:5:8,68 --> 0:5:9,72
beforehand, you said?

0:5:9,72 --> 0:5:13,2
MURAT: At that time, yes.


97
0:5:13,2 --> 0:5:14,96
HAMILTON MORRIS: The life cycle
of a mushroom begins


98
0:5:14,96 --> 0:5:18,7
when two spores of opposite
mating types germinate in a


99
0:5:18,7 --> 0:5:22,22
growth substrate and send out
threads called "hyphae." The


100
0:5:22,22 --> 0:5:25,2
hyphae form a clamp connection
where genetic information is


101
0:5:25,2 --> 0:5:28,69
exchanged and then expand into
a web of undifferentiated


102
0:5:28,69 --> 0:5:32,54
threads called "mycelium." If
the conditions are right, the


103
0:5:32,54 --> 0:5:36,9
mycelium organizes itself into
a mushroom with special


104
0:5:36,9 --> 0:5:39,71
reproductive cells called
basidia, which catapult spores


105
0:5:39,71 --> 0:5:43,415
into the air and give rise
to new mushrooms.


106
0:5:43,415 --> 0:5:45,67
And you bought this property?

we were in the--


109

in the bedroom of my daughter.

With several aquaria
this time.


111
0:5:55,56 --> 0:5:58,86
After the one aquarium, I
started to get our aquariums.


112
0:5:58,86 --> 0:6:0,96
ALI: Start searching on the
street at night and people


113
0:6:0,96 --> 0:6:2,51
were throwing out their
old aquariums.


114
0:6:2,51 --> 0:6:3,53

118

119
0:6:9,85 --> 0:6:10,39
MURAT: Or something.


120
0:6:10,39 --> 0:6:12,48
And we started to grow
mushrooms in there.


121
0:6:12,48 --> 0:6:15,6
Then we rented our first
place, in a town called


122
0:6:15,6 --> 0:6:17,6
Leiderdorp, not far from here.


123
0:6:17,6 --> 0:6:20,99
We made some sheds out
of plastic foil


124
0:6:20,99 --> 0:6:21,99
with shelves in it.


125
0:6:21,99 --> 0:6:25,16
And there we started our first
professional growth.


126
0:6:25,16 --> 0:6:26,9
ALI: Yeah, yeah.


127
0:6:26,9 --> 0:6:29,12

a bigger plays with ten

130
0:6:31,576 --> 0:6:33,17
The demand was so high that we


131
0:6:33,17 --> 0:6:36,6
couldn't make enough mushrooms.


132
0:6:36,6 --> 0:6:39,72

which was far more ideal.

you growing before the

136
0:6:44,77 --> 0:6:49,37

of the psilocybe cubensis.

And the panaeolus cyanescens.

that was what you

you sold?

from any other countries.


152

So we have lists of drugs
that are illegal--


153

to buy it, to use it, to bring
it over the border to trade.


154
0:7:35,53 --> 0:7:37,2
It's completely illegal.


155
0:7:37,2 --> 0:7:40,9
Then we have a small
portion of drugs--


156
0:7:40,9 --> 0:7:43,74
in Holland, we call it the "soft
drugs"-- where you have


157
0:7:43,74 --> 0:7:47,1
weed and hashish
and the joints.


158
0:7:47,1 --> 0:7:49,92
Or we call it joints, because
we smoke joints.


159
0:7:49,92 --> 0:7:54,8
I don't know if that's the
correct term, but we have


160

161

And they have on paper saying
that if the amount isn't


163
0:8:2,95 --> 0:8:7,86
bigger than so-and-so much, then
it's allowed to have it,


164

it's allowed to smoke it, and
you are allowed to sell it.

207
0:10:28,92 --> 0:10:29,32
KAREM CANATAN: Yeah.


208
0:10:29,32 --> 0:10:32,25
Well, part of them were
already on it.


209
0:10:32,25 --> 0:10:35,44
But especially this
list from here.


210
0:10:35,44 --> 0:10:37,51
The magic mushroom list.


211
0:10:37,51 --> 0:10:41,41
And it says here that magic
mushrooms are mushrooms who


212
0:10:41,41 --> 0:10:45,89
have by nature these and these
active ingredients.


213
0:10:45,89 --> 0:10:50,69
And then all these species
are on the list.


214
0:10:50,69 --> 0:10:52,34
ALI: The law changed in 2008--


215
0:10:52,34 --> 0:10:54,68
1st of December, 2008.


216
0:10:54,68 --> 0:10:55,4
Sad day.


217
0:10:55,4 --> 0:10:56,65
Saddest day of my life.


218
0:10:56,65 --> 0:11:1,43



219
0:11:1,43 --> 0:11:3,21
HAMILTON MORRIS: How much time
did they give you after the


220
0:11:3,21 --> 0:11:6,4
ban to get rid of your
stock of mushrooms?


221
0:11:6,4 --> 0:11:8,82
MURAT: 10 days.


222
0:11:8,82 --> 0:11:12,88
ALI: 10 days to clear 16
growing houses, all the


223
0:11:12,88 --> 0:11:14,7
equipment, and so on.


224
0:11:14,7 --> 0:11:15,78
HAMILTON MORRIS: And you were
saying all these other


225
0:11:15,78 --> 0:11:18,74
different bans have been given
enormous amounts of time,


226
0:11:18,74 --> 0:11:20,87
years before they have to--


227
0:11:20,87 --> 0:11:23,2
ALI: Mink farms, for instance.


228
0:11:23,2 --> 0:11:25,94
They got 10 years to
change the plans.


229
0:11:25,94 --> 0:11:26,56
HAMILTON MORRIS: 10 years?


230
0:11:26,56 --> 0:11:27,19
ALI: 10 years.


231
0:11:27,19 --> 0:11:28,105
HAMILTON MORRIS: And
you got ten days.


232
0:11:28,105 --> 0:11:29,38
ALI: 10 days.


233
0:11:29,38 --> 0:11:31,32
Look at that.


234
0:11:31,32 --> 0:11:33,15
HAMILTON MORRIS: How did you
get rid of the mushrooms?


235
0:11:33,15 --> 0:11:36,18
ALI: That was the easiest part,
because people were


236
0:11:36,18 --> 0:11:37,9
lined up here.


237
0:11:37,9 --> 0:11:41,35
the last mushrooms, the
last mushrooms.


238
0:11:41,35 --> 0:11:43,23
HAMILTON MORRIS: Despite the
chemical and biological


239
0:11:43,23 --> 0:11:46,81
similarity to the mushroom,
parliament decided not to ban


240
0:11:46,81 --> 0:11:48,85
the magic truffle.


241
0:11:48,85 --> 0:11:52,57
ALI: When the law changed in
2008, we just continued with


242
0:11:52,57 --> 0:11:56,47
the truffles that we were
already growing in that time.


243
0:11:56,47 --> 0:11:57,98
HAMILTON MORRIS: So
what is a truffle?


244
0:11:57,98 --> 0:12:1,29
And how is it different
from a mushroom?


245
0:12:1,29 --> 0:12:2,54
MURAT: [INAUDIBLE]


246
0:12:2,54 --> 0:12:5,53
for nutrients and moisture.


247
0:12:5,53 --> 0:12:7,16
HAMILTON MORRIS: Like
all organisms, a


248
0:12:7,16 --> 0:12:9,37
fungus seeks to reproduce.


249
0:12:9,37 --> 0:12:13,0
But environmental conditions are
not always ideal to do so.


250
0:12:13,0 --> 0:12:16,82
If the substrate is too dry,
cold, hot, or poor in


251
0:12:16,82 --> 0:12:20,35
nutrients, the mycelium will
grow inwards, forming a


252
0:12:20,35 --> 0:12:24,8
tangled clump of globular fungus
called a sclerotium.


253
0:12:24,8 --> 0:12:27,75
These hard structures are
able to survive in harsh


254
0:12:27,75 --> 0:12:31,1
environmental conditions until
the time is right to send


255
0:12:31,1 --> 0:12:32,35
forth mushrooms.


256
0:12:32,35 --> 0:12:34,57



257
0:12:34,57 --> 0:12:37,38
Murat offered to give me
a guided tour of their


258
0:12:37,38 --> 0:12:42,37
innovative sclerotium
cultivation facilities.


259
0:12:42,37 --> 0:12:44,31
MURAT: We'll start where
it all begins.


260
0:12:44,31 --> 0:12:49,53
That's the dirty side where
all raw materials come in.


261
0:12:49,53 --> 0:12:54,91



262
0:12:54,91 --> 0:12:57,1
HAMILTON MORRIS: First, the rye
grass seed substrate is


263
0:12:57,1 --> 0:13:0,15
sterilized in an
industrial-sized autoclave to


264
0:13:0,15 --> 0:13:3,47
kill opportunistic bacteria and
fungi, which are equally


265
0:13:3,47 --> 0:13:6,906
eager to consume the bags of
warm, moist nutrients.


266
0:13:6,906 --> 0:13:13,13



267
0:13:13,13 --> 0:13:15,8
Then the bags are inoculated
with a


268
0:13:15,8 --> 0:13:18,1
liquid culture of mycelium.


269
0:13:18,1 --> 0:13:20,46
MURAT: This is a class
100 cleanroom.


270
0:13:20,46 --> 0:13:27,51
That means that only 100
particles of 0.00096 micron


271
0:13:27,51 --> 0:13:30,79
may be present in one
cubic feet of air.


272
0:13:30,79 --> 0:13:34,39
Normally in an operating room
it's class 10,000, so 10,000


273
0:13:34,39 --> 0:13:39,512
particles may appear in
a cubic foot of air.


274
0:13:39,512 --> 0:13:40,43
HAMILTON MORRIS: Impressive.


275
0:13:40,43 --> 0:13:43,11
ALI: If you do everything, like
your laboratory work and


276
0:13:43,11 --> 0:13:46,57
your growing, under one roof,
you get a cross-contamination


277
0:13:46,57 --> 0:13:47,54
somewhere, somehow.


278
0:13:47,54 --> 0:13:51,97
And that risk was so big that
we looked for a proper


279
0:13:51,97 --> 0:13:55,84
building with at least two
separate departments.


280
0:13:55,84 --> 0:13:57,51
HAMILTON MORRIS: Then the bags
are transported to an


281
0:13:57,51 --> 0:14:0,65
incubation chamber, where a
temperature of 28 degrees


282
0:14:0,65 --> 0:14:4,8
Celsius is maintained to
accelerate the colonization of


283
0:14:4,8 --> 0:14:5,58
the substrate.


284
0:14:5,58 --> 0:14:8,52
How do you prevent the
growth of mushrooms?


285
0:14:8,52 --> 0:14:10,49
MURAT: By controlling the
temperature and the


286
0:14:10,49 --> 0:14:12,2
microclimate in the bag.


287
0:14:12,2 --> 0:14:15,72
The microclimate in the bag
is not suitable for


288
0:14:15,72 --> 0:14:18,53
formation of mushrooms.


289
0:14:18,53 --> 0:14:20,62
HAMILTON MORRIS: The final stage
is the nursery, where


290
0:14:20,62 --> 0:14:23,64
the bags are kept in darkness
for as many as five months


291
0:14:23,64 --> 0:14:26,55
before the sclerotia
are mature.


292
0:14:26,55 --> 0:14:30,89
And what is the capacity of
this plant at the moment?


293
0:14:30,89 --> 0:14:35,44
MURAT: Full capacity, if we
worked 24 hours a day in three


294
0:14:35,44 --> 0:14:38,62
shifts, 18,000 tons per year.


295
0:14:38,62 --> 0:14:40,18
ALI: Something like
that, yeah.


296
0:14:40,18 --> 0:14:40,95
HAMILTON MORRIS: 18,000 tons?


297
0:14:40,95 --> 0:14:41,433
ALI: Yes.


298
0:14:41,433 --> 0:14:42,4
MURAT: Yeah.


299
0:14:42,4 --> 0:14:45,46
MURAT: I think that sclerotia,
to go for the mushroom market


300
0:14:45,46 --> 0:14:47,61
one-on-one, by now--


301
0:14:47,61 --> 0:14:50,17
ALI: By now it's one-on-one,
yeah.


302
0:14:50,17 --> 0:14:53,1
HAMILTON MORRIS: Upon maturity,
the bags are opened


303
0:14:53,1 --> 0:14:56,43
the sclerotia are plucked from
their substrate, cleaned with


304
0:14:56,43 --> 0:15:0,55
a soft-bristled brush, and
packaged for distribution.


305
0:15:0,55 --> 0:15:3,41
It seems your brand is the only
brand, except for one


306
0:15:3,41 --> 0:15:5,37
another that I saw, that
you can get at


307
0:15:5,37 --> 0:15:6,74
smart shops in Amsterdam.


308
0:15:6,74 --> 0:15:7,2
MURAT: Yeah.


309
0:15:7,2 --> 0:15:7,92
That might be correct.


310
0:15:7,92 --> 0:15:10,83
There are some home growers,
but as far as commercially


311
0:15:10,83 --> 0:15:13,88
grown sclerotia, I think
we're the largest.


312
0:15:13,88 --> 0:15:16,33
HAMILTON MORRIS: Do you
have any competitors?


313
0:15:16,33 --> 0:15:19,484
MURAT: Everyone who grows a
truffle is a competitor.


314
0:15:19,484 --> 0:15:20,78
HAMILTON MORRIS: Ah.


315
0:15:20,78 --> 0:15:24,4
Each package contains a single
serving of fresh,


316
0:15:24,4 --> 0:15:26,71
psilocybin-containing
sclerotia.


317
0:15:26,71 --> 0:15:31,195
MURAT: We deliver them to
the shop in boxes of 24.


318
0:15:31,195 --> 0:15:35,66
We give the shops 24 booklets so
that people get the proper


319
0:15:35,66 --> 0:15:36,815
information.


320
0:15:36,815 --> 0:15:38,65
HAMILTON MORRIS: Good.


321
0:15:38,65 --> 0:15:44,18



322
0:15:44,18 --> 0:15:47,53
Murat invited me to join him
on his delivery route and


323
0:15:47,53 --> 0:15:49,895
visit the magic truffle
storefront in Amsterdam.


324
0:15:49,895 --> 0:15:57,52



325
0:15:57,52 --> 0:16:0,9
The Dutch countryside touched
us both deeply, but we could


326
0:16:0,9 --> 0:16:3,76
not linger on these
natural delights.


327
0:16:3,76 --> 0:16:6,6
We had important sclerotium
deliveries to make.


328
0:16:6,6 --> 0:16:9,43



329
0:16:9,43 --> 0:16:12,23
One of the stops was a wholesale
psychedelics


330
0:16:12,23 --> 0:16:15,57
distributor specializing
in peyote cacti.


331
0:16:15,57 --> 0:16:19,674



332
0:16:19,674 --> 0:16:22,6
We finally made it to the shop,
and not a minute too


333
0:16:22,6 --> 0:16:25,99
soon as the hoards of
truffle-hungry Dutch waited


334
0:16:25,99 --> 0:16:28,98
eagerly for their Queen's
Day delights.


335
0:16:28,98 --> 0:16:38,86
[BACKGROUND CHATTER]


336
0:16:38,86 --> 0:16:41,2
HAMILTON MORRIS: Chills and
Thrills was not the truffle


337
0:16:41,2 --> 0:16:45,3
theme park I was expecting, but
I knew the real ride would


338
0:16:45,3 --> 0:16:47,16
come later.


339
0:16:47,16 --> 0:16:48,18
SPEAKER 1: you?


340
0:16:48,18 --> 0:16:49,37
HAMILTON MORRIS: I'm good.


341
0:16:49,37 --> 0:16:53,27
I would like to buy some
P. Tampanensis.


342
0:16:53,27 --> 0:16:55,35
SPEAKER 1:


343
0:16:55,35 --> 0:16:56,715
HAMILTON MORRIS: Thank you.


344
0:16:56,715 --> 0:16:58,49
SPEAKER 1: you.


345
0:16:58,49 --> 0:17:1,43
Enjoy.


346
0:17:1,43 --> 0:17:4,27
HAMILTON MORRIS: The truffles
require no preparation.


347
0:17:4,27 --> 0:17:6,22
And thought the truffle
brothers recommended a


348
0:17:6,22 --> 0:17:10,99
truffle-based milkshake, I chose
to take them raw so that


349
0:17:10,99 --> 0:17:11,72
I could savor their essences.


350
0:17:11,72 --> 0:17:18,112



351
0:17:18,112 --> 0:17:19,75
That's not bad at all.


352
0:17:19,75 --> 0:17:22,96
It's actually kind of good.


353
0:17:22,96 --> 0:17:24,21
Well.


354
0:17:24,21 --> 0:17:26,7



355
0:17:26,7 --> 0:17:31,5
It has almost a sour aftertaste,
but sour is the


356
0:17:31,5 --> 0:17:36,68
last taste I would associate
with a truffle.


357
0:17:36,68 --> 0:17:47,34



358
0:17:47,34 --> 0:17:50,436
Do you want some
truffle crumbs?


359
0:17:50,436 --> 0:17:53,838
Scarf them down.


360
0:17:53,838 --> 0:17:55,32
Mmm.


361
0:17:55,32 --> 0:17:57,42
Tastes pretty darn--


362
0:17:57,42 --> 0:17:59,1
uh, like a wet nut.


363
0:17:59,1 --> 0:18:2,46
This is a drug?


364
0:18:2,46 --> 0:18:3,9
This is a drug?


365
0:18:3,9 --> 0:18:6,34
This is technically a drug?


366
0:18:6,34 --> 0:18:7,59
All right.


367
0:18:7,59 --> 0:18:20,66



368
0:18:20,66 --> 0:18:21,74
KAREM CANATAN: Well,
I don't have any


369
0:18:21,74 --> 0:18:23,93
experience with the truffles.


370
0:18:23,93 --> 0:18:27,86
But if it's not a health risk
and it doesn't have any other


371
0:18:27,86 --> 0:18:31,31
negative side effects,
I would say allow it.


372
0:18:31,31 --> 0:18:34,49
And then make sure you
can control it.


373
0:18:34,49 --> 0:18:35,7
HAMILTON MORRIS: What
sort of person


374
0:18:35,7 --> 0:18:38,65
buys psychedelic truffles?


375
0:18:38,65 --> 0:18:41,45
MURAT: I don't think there's
a specific type of person.


376
0:18:41,45 --> 0:18:43,25
Age has nothing to do with it.


377
0:18:43,25 --> 0:18:49,77
We've had people in their 80s
coming for mushrooms.


378
0:18:49,77 --> 0:18:52,94
ALI: Yeah, or people who are
curious for the experience who


379
0:18:52,94 --> 0:18:57,26
think there's more
in life than the


380
0:18:57,26 --> 0:18:58,92
regular things we see.


381
0:18:58,92 --> 0:19:3,52
And there's also the real
cosmonauts, who use it for the


382
0:19:3,52 --> 0:19:7,46
real spiritual thing, like
the shamanic experiences.


383
0:19:7,46 --> 0:19:11,938
HAMILTON MORRIS: What category
would you put yourselves into?


384
0:19:11,938 --> 0:19:13,28
ALI: None.


385
0:19:13,28 --> 0:19:15,18
HAMILTON MORRIS: None?


386
0:19:15,18 --> 0:19:16,899
You don't use your
own product?


387
0:19:16,899 --> 0:19:18,895
ALI: No.


388
0:19:18,895 --> 0:19:20,145
MURAT: Bummer.


389
0:19:20,145 --> 0:19:40,86



390
0:19:40,86 --> 0:19:43,17
HAMILTON MORRIS: While the
Mazatec Indians prescribed


391
0:19:43,17 --> 0:19:46,82
special conditions under which
the sacred mushroom should be


392
0:19:46,82 --> 0:19:49,58
consumed, there exist
little-known rituals


393
0:19:49,58 --> 0:19:52,44
surrounding the psychedelic
sclerotium.


394
0:19:52,44 --> 0:19:56,24
Their history remains
unwritten.


395
0:19:56,24 --> 0:19:59,35
Though I feel sweaty and
overwhelmed by the chaos of


396
0:19:59,35 --> 0:20:2,56
Queen's Day, I feel no
compulsion to ritualistically


397
0:20:2,56 --> 0:20:6,24
stab a dog and play with its
internal organs in a van.


398
0:20:6,24 --> 0:20:11,29
Nor do I wish to jump off a
bridge to a watery death.


399
0:20:11,29 --> 0:20:13,84
I'm glad that the resilient
structure of the sclerotium


400
0:20:13,84 --> 0:20:17,44
has survived the inhospitable
