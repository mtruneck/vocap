CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: A big thanks to Mr.
Merrill students for getting things started


5
0:0:30,159 --> 0:0:35,579
today, we have a packed show, so let`s go
ahead and get to it.


6
0:0:35,579 --> 0:0:39,55
First up, hearings on Capitol Hill. Now, you
are not going to see any pictures from these


7
0:0:39,55 --> 0:0:43,78
hearings, and you are not going to hear anything
that was said in them, either. That is because


8
0:0:43,78 --> 0:0:47,84
these are closed hearings. That means no members
of the media, no members of the public are


9
0:0:47,84 --> 0:0:49,3
allowed in.


10
0:0:49,3 --> 0:0:55,35
We do know what they are about, though. This
-- the attack on the U.S. facility in Benghazi,


11
0:0:55,35 --> 0:0:59,1
Libya. It happened just over two months ago,
the members of Congress who are running the


12
0:0:59,1 --> 0:1:3,5
hearings have questions about how the attacks
happened and what happened afterward. And


13
0:1:3,5 --> 0:1:8,189
they are hoping to get answers. Martha Shade
has more on who`ll be at the hearings and


14
0:1:8,189 --> 0:1:9,89
what issues are expected to come up.


15
0:1:9,89 --> 0:1:10,159
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


16
0:1:10,159 --> 0:1:13,17
MARTHA SHADE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Several of
Washington`s power players will be on Capitol


17
0:1:13,17 --> 0:1:18,38
Hill, expecting to be grilled about the deadly
consulate attack in Benghazi, Libya. U.S.


18
0:1:18,38 --> 0:1:24,179
ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans
were killed in the September 11th assault.


19
0:1:24,179 --> 0:1:28,409
Former CIA director David Petraeus is scheduled
to address this Senate House Intelligence


20
0:1:28,409 --> 0:1:32,289
Committee, his testimony was in question after
his sudden resignation last week.


21
0:1:32,289 --> 0:1:35,799
REP. PATRICK MEEHAN, (R ), PENNSYLVANIA: He
is necessary, he understands and was there


22
0:1:35,799 --> 0:1:39,28
during the time when the Benghazi events occurred.


23
0:1:39,28 --> 0:1:45,9
SHADE: Some Republicans have been going after
U.N. ambassador Susan Rice. After the violence,


24
0:1:45,9 --> 0:1:50,549
she said intelligence pointed to a spontaneous,
not pre-planned attack. Senator John McCain


25
0:1:50,549 --> 0:1:54,81
said Rice was deceptive, while Lindsey Graham
just doesn`t trust her.


26
0:1:54,81 --> 0:1:57,359
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, (R ), SOUTH CAROLINA:
And the reason I don`t trust her, is because


27
0:1:57,359 --> 0:2:0,799
I think she knew better, and if she didn`t
know better she shouldn`t be the voice of


28
0:2:0,799 --> 0:2:1,52
America.


29
0:2:1,52 --> 0:2:5,109
SHADE: President Barack Obama had a message
to the senators in Rice`s defense.


30
0:2:5,109 --> 0:2:8,649
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA: If Senator McCain and Senator


31
0:2:8,649 --> 0:2:15,95
Graham and others want to go after somebody,
they should go after me, and I`m happy to


32
0:2:15,95 --> 0:2:17,42
have that discussion with them.


33
0:2:17,42 --> 0:2:22,33
SHADE: The senators oppose Rice possibly being
nominated to secretary of state to replace


34
0:2:22,33 --> 0:2:26,53
Hillary Clinton, and say they will do whatever
they can do to block it.


35
0:2:26,53 --> 0:2:30,22
Senator Rand Paul says he is no fun of Rice,
but there are bigger issues at play.


36
0:2:30,22 --> 0:2:32,67
SEN. RAND PAUL, (R ), KENTUCKY: But I think
the more important question is, why were there


37
0:2:32,67 --> 0:2:34,72
no Marines guarding our ambassador.


38
0:2:34,72 --> 0:2:39,86
SHADE: Who made that decision, is likely to
be discussed during these hearings. I`m Martha


39
0:2:39,86 --> 0:2:41,9
Shade reporting.


40
0:2:41,9 --> 0:2:42,23
(END VIDEOTAPE)


41
0:2:42,23 --> 0:2:47,22
AZUZ: Next stop, we are looking at a fine,
not just any old fine, the largest criminal


42
0:2:47,22 --> 0:2:54,26
fine in U.S. history: it`s $1.2 billion, and
the company that`s paying it, is BP. You might


43
0:2:54,26 --> 0:3:0,59
remember this: an explosion in 2010 in a BP
oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. A massive oil


44
0:3:0,59 --> 0:3:6,6
spill that leaked more than 200 million gallons
of oil into the water. And the serious environmental


45
0:3:6,6 --> 0:3:11,76
problems when some of that oil washed up along
the U.S. Gulf coast. Yesterday, BP reached


46
0:3:11,76 --> 0:3:17,29
the settlement with the U.S. government. The
company will pay $4.5 billion. That includes


47
0:3:17,29 --> 0:3:22,46
the record fine, and it covers other criminal
charges and government penalties. BP has already


48
0:3:22,46 --> 0:3:28,15
agreed to pay 20 billion to cover damages
from the spill, and nearly 8 billion to private


49
0:3:28,15 --> 0:3:34,1
victims. For perspective in a two year since
the oil spill happened, BP has made $43 billion


50
0:3:34,1 --> 0:3:35,27
in profits.


51
0:3:35,27 --> 0:3:40,88
You`ve heard this talk about this fiscal cliff.
It`s a series automatic government spending


52
0:3:40,88 --> 0:3:46,53
cuts and tax increases that could hit Americans
next year, if Congress and President Obama


53
0:3:46,53 --> 0:3:51,46
don`t figure out a way around them. Here is
a look at how the fiscal cliff could impact


54
0:3:51,46 --> 0:3:56,71
education: school districts nationwide would
have less money, so after school programs,


55
0:3:56,71 --> 0:4:1,9
enrichment programs, sports could be cut.
More teachers could lose their jobs or get


56
0:4:1,9 --> 0:4:6,68
paid less. And many schools wouldn`t be able
to make needed repairs, upgrade computers


57
0:4:6,68 --> 0:4:11,43
or get new textbooks. Because so many schools
have been struggling with less money after


58
0:4:11,43 --> 0:4:15,98
the recession hit, this fiscal cliff could
make things worse: and that`s why so many


59
0:4:15,98 --> 0:4:20,16
people in education are paying attention to
what happens as Congress and the president


60
0:4:20,16 --> 0:4:21,669
try to find the solution.


61
0:4:21,669 --> 0:4:23,1
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


62
0:4:23,1 --> 0:4:30,74
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See, if you can ID me.
I`m a country that`s been around for centuries,


63
0:4:30,74 --> 0:4:36,71
but I established my current Communist form
of government in 1949. I`m one of the world`s


64
0:4:36,71 --> 0:4:42,8
largest nations in size. And I`m the largest
in population.


65
0:4:42,8 --> 0:4:49,73
I`m China and I`m home to more than 1.3 billion
people.


66
0:4:49,73 --> 0:4:51,29
(END VIDEOCLIP)


67
0:4:51,29 --> 0:4:57,68
AZUZ: There`s been a change at the top of
China`s Communist Party. In the U.S., presidential


68
0:4:57,68 --> 0:5:1,63
candidates are out in public all the time.
That`s not how things work in China. When


69
0:5:1,63 --> 0:5:6,75
that country`s leadership goes through a transition,
it all happens behind closed doors. These


70
0:5:6,75 --> 0:5:11,6
seven men are those new leaders. They make
up the most powerful committee in the Chinese


71
0:5:11,6 --> 0:5:17,32
government. And the one who is front and center,
is Xi Jinping, he is the new head of China`s


72
0:5:17,32 --> 0:5:21,69
Communist Party and is expected to lead the
country for the next ten years. A lot of other


73
0:5:21,69 --> 0:5:26,32
nations are wondering, what to expect from
Xi in this committee. That`s because in addition


74
0:5:26,32 --> 0:5:30,62
to having the world`s biggest population,
China also has the world`s second biggest


75
0:5:30,62 --> 0:5:35,96
economy. That means it has a lot of influence
on the world`s economic issues.


76
0:5:35,96 --> 0:5:41,139
Back into U.S., 13 deaths have been reported
to the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration.


77
0:5:41,139 --> 0:5:46,73
The reports say that those 13 people died
after using a supplement called "5-hour Energy."


78
0:5:46,73 --> 0:5:52,26
The FDA launched an investigation, it`s required
to by law. But it also says, that a report


79
0:5:52,26 --> 0:5:58,52
by itself doesn`t mean that a product is responsible
for health issue. So far, connection between


80
0:5:58,52 --> 0:6:4,18
the deaths and 5-hour Energy hasn`t been established.
One thing the FDA is likely looking at is


81
0:6:4,18 --> 0:6:11,29
caffeine. One 5-hour Energy has 207 milligrams
of caffeine. To compare, a cup of coffee can


82
0:6:11,29 --> 0:6:17,639
have anywhere from 95 to 200 milligrams. A
regular can of Red Bull has about 80 milligrams.


83
0:6:17,639 --> 0:6:23,169
Dr. Sanjay Gupta is CNN`s chief medical correspondent.
He was talking to a colleague recently, and


84
0:6:23,169 --> 0:6:27,94
this other doctor brought up an issue that
he described as the biggest manmade epidemic


85
0:6:27,94 --> 0:6:32,9
in the United States. He was talking about
accidental death from overdoses. But not from


86
0:6:32,9 --> 0:6:39,639
illegal drugs, from prescription drugs. Accidental
overdoses are the number one cause of accidental


87
0:6:39,639 --> 0:6:44,66
death in America. We talked to Dr. Gupta about
ways to prevent this, and some of the surprising


88
0:6:44,66 --> 0:6:46,48
numbers associated with the issue.


89
0:6:46,48 --> 0:6:47,0
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


90
0:6:47,0 --> 0:6:50,53
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Carl,
I think the statistics that gets everyone`s


91
0:6:50,53 --> 0:6:56,1
attention here, is that every 90 minutes in
this country, someone dies from an accidental


92
0:6:56,1 --> 0:7:0,87
overdose of prescription drugs. You keep that
in mind, and I think that tells you a large


93
0:7:0,87 --> 0:7:4,72
tale. And also, if you look at the world,
and you think about young people and old people


94
0:7:4,72 --> 0:7:9,93
alike, 80 percent of the world`s pain pills
are taken in the United States. We prescribe


95
0:7:9,93 --> 0:7:14,71
enough to give every man, woman and child
a doze every 4 hours for three weeks. So,


96
0:7:14,71 --> 0:7:18,24
look, we are talking a lot about this, but
best advice: if you have pain pills in your


97
0:7:18,24 --> 0:7:20,32
medicine cabinet, get rid of them.


98
0:7:20,32 --> 0:7:24,5
People have a preconceived notion of who this
people are that are dying, but oftentimes


99
0:7:24,5 --> 0:7:28,4
it`s your friends, your families, your neighbors,
it`s not people who you would think of as


100
0:7:28,4 --> 0:7:31,76
addicts. There are people who have legitimate
pain that need to have those pain concerns


101
0:7:31,76 --> 0:7:36,72
addressed. Don`t misuse these pills, and ask
yourself, every time you are given a prescription,


102
0:7:36,72 --> 0:7:40,88
do I really need this? Hopefully, that`s going
to help a lot of people, Carl. Back to you.


103
0:7:40,88 --> 0:7:41,919
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


104
0:7:41,919 --> 0:7:47,24
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today "Shoutout" goes
out to Mr. Love`s journalism technology student


105
0:7:47,24 --> 0:7:51,43
at Sandpoint High School in Sand Point, Idaho.


106
0:7:51,43 --> 0:7:57,169
Francis Scott Key wrote the lyrics o which
of these songs? You know what to do, is it


107
0:7:57,169 --> 0:8:3,16
"My Country "Tis of Thee." "America the Beautiful,"
God Bless America" or the "Star-Spangled Banner."


108
0:8:3,16 --> 0:8:11,9
You`ve got three seconds, go!


109
0:8:11,9 --> 0:8:17,449
Key wrote the lyrics to the "Star-Spangled
Banner" during the war of 1812. That`s your


110
0:8:17,449 --> 0:8:19,87
answer and that`s your "Shoutout."


111
0:8:19,87 --> 0:8:21,13
(END VIDEO CLIP)


112
0:8:21,13 --> 0:8:25,55
AZUZ: You might expect to hear the "Star-Spangled
Banner" before a sports event, that tradition


113
0:8:25,55 --> 0:8:30,56
is connected to some controversy in part of
Pennsylvania. The commissioner in charge of


114
0:8:30,56 --> 0:8:36,24
high school hockey emailed teams and suggested
that they not sing the anthem. He says it`s


115
0:8:36,24 --> 0:8:40,169
not a question of patriotism, it`s a concern
about costs.


116
0:8:40,169 --> 0:8:45,19
High school hockey rents ice time for games,
so every game is carefully timed. When time


117
0:8:45,19 --> 0:8:50,6
runs out, the game ends, even if the clock
hasn`t hit zero. If the singer takes longer


118
0:8:50,6 --> 0:8:55,14
with the national anthem, it eats into that
game time. Some people aren`t happy with the


119
0:8:55,14 --> 0:8:59,58
idea of skipping the national anthem. They`ve
suggested extending the time for the game


120
0:8:59,58 --> 0:9:4,69
or cutting time somewhere else. One person
suggested using a pre- recorded rendition


121
0:9:4,69 --> 0:9:7,77
of the anthems, so you always know how long
it will be.


122
0:9:7,77 --> 0:9:13,44
Tile, linoleum, marble, carpet, hardwood,
there are a lot of types of floors. But the


123
0:9:13,44 --> 0:9:18,83
owner of this business in Pittsburgh went
a different route: she paid pennies for her


124
0:9:18,83 --> 0:9:24,89
flooring, actually, she didn`t pay them, she
used them. 250,000 pennies took her and some


125
0:9:24,89 --> 0:9:30,57
volunteers about 300 hours to lay it all down,
but she said it`s actually a lot cheaper than


126
0:9:30,57 --> 0:9:35,8
paying for tile. So, how do you make a floor
from all these? I guess, you lay the pennies


127
0:9:35,8 --> 0:9:37,67
down and then start linking them together.


128
0:9:37,67 --> 0:9:41,18
Suppose, if you don`t want to be ordinary
that`s certainly on the way to change. You


129
0:9:41,18 --> 0:9:44,89
imagine when the customers walking and see
it, though. They are going to be floored.


130
0:9:44,89 --> 0:9:48,48
They might not be able to make sense of it,
but I know just how to ask them for their


131
0:9:48,48 --> 0:9:51,86
opinions. Penny for your thoughts? All right,
that`s all the puns we can handle for now.


132
0:9:51,86 --> 0:11:51,86
I hope you have a great weekend.
