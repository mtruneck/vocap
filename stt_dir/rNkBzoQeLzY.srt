1
0:0:0,41 --> 0:0:5,87
PROFESSOR: OKAY, SO LAST TIME WE CONCLUDED
TALKING ABOUT MUCH OF


2
0:0:5,87 --> 0:0:9,24
THE ANGIOSPERM DIVERSITY, BUT I DIDN'T GET
THROUGH A CHANCE TO


3
0:0:9,24 --> 0:0:12,809
GET THROUGH THE LAST OF THE DIFFERENCES THAT
DISTINGUISH, EASILY


4
0:0:12,809 --> 0:0:18,39
DISTINGUISHED THE TWO MAJOR GROUPS OF ANGIOSPERMS,
THE EUDICOTS


5
0:0:18,39 --> 0:0:23,289
AND THE MONOCOTS. AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE
IN TALKING


6
0:0:23,289 --> 0:0:25,439
ABOUT SEED GERMINATION AFTERWARDS THERE ARE
SOME MAJOR


7
0:0:25,439 --> 0:0:30,65
DIFFERENCES THERE. AND ALSO WITH REGARD TO
THE STRUCTURE AND


8
0:0:30,65 --> 0:0:35,8
GROWTH OF, OF ANGIOSPERMS, THE EUDICOTS AND
THE MONOCOTS DIFFER


9
0:0:35,8 --> 0:0:40,14
PRETTY DRAMATICALLY IN REALLY INTERESTING
WAYS. SO THIS ISN'T


10
0:0:40,14 --> 0:0:45,899
JUST A COMPLETELY ESOTERIC DISCUSSION ABOUT
THE, DISTINCTION


11
0:0:45,899 --> 0:0:50,51
BETWEEN THESE TWO MAJOR GROUPS OF FLOWERING
PLANTS. AND SO


12
0:0:50,51 --> 0:0:55,239
TODAY WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FROM TALKING ABOUT
DIVERSITY IN GENERAL


13
0:0:55,239 --> 0:1:1,149
AND START TALKING ABOUT THE STRUCTURE AND
FUNCTION OF PLANTS AND


14
0:1:1,149 --> 0:1:6,44
REALLY THE ELEGANT ANATOMY AND MORPHOLOGY
OF PLANTS AND THE WAY,


15
0:1:6,44 --> 0:1:12,6
WAYS IN WHICH THEY GROW WHICH ARE PRETTY STEREO-,
PRETTY


16
0:1:12,6 --> 0:1:17,6
CONSERVED ACROSS THE GROUPS OF FLOWERING PLANTS
AS WELL AS IN


17
0:1:17,6 --> 0:1:25,36
OTHER CASES, OTHER, OTHER VASCULAR PLANTS.
AND IT'S, IT FOLLOWS


18
0:1:25,36 --> 0:1:30,67
SOME BASIC RULES WHICH ARE REALLY ELEGANT
AND, AND FAIRLY EASY TO


19
0:1:30,67 --> 0:1:33,3
UNDERSTAND ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE TO KEEP SORT
OF A 3-DIMENSIONAL


20
0:1:33,3 --> 0:1:38,68
PERSPECTIVE AS WE GO THROUGH THIS. OKAY, SO
LAST TIME I WENT


21
0:1:38,68 --> 0:1:42,85
THROUGH THESE FEW CHARACTERS HERE THAT DISTINGUISH
MONOCOTS ON


22
0:1:42,85 --> 0:1:47,8
THE LEFT FROM THE EUDICOTS ON THE RIGHT. THE
SINGLE COTYLEDON,


23
0:1:47,8 --> 0:1:51,27
OF COURSE THE BASIS OF THE NAME HERE, IN MONOCOTS
WHICH IS THE


24
0:1:51,27 --> 0:1:55,36
DERIVED FEATURE, THIS SINGLE EMBRYONIC LEAF,
AND I'LL TALK MORE


25
0:1:55,36 --> 0:1:55,36



26
0:1:55,36 --> 0:1:59,71
ABOUT THIS IN A MINUTE. AND THEN TWO COTYLEDONS
OR TWO


27
0:1:59,71 --> 0:2:5,24
EMBRYONIC LEAVES IN EUDICOTS WHICH IS ANCESTRAL
IN FLOWERING


28
0:2:5,24 --> 0:2:11,3
PLANTS, THE MONOCOT CONDITION BEING DERIVED.
AS FAR AS LEAF


29
0:2:11,3 --> 0:2:15,18
VENATION GOES, THE LEAVES ARE, HAVE THEIR
VEINS ORIENTED IN THIS


30
0:2:15,18 --> 0:2:18,7
PARALLEL PATTERN TYPICALLY AND MONOCOTS, WHICH
IS A DERIVED


31
0:2:18,7 --> 0:2:23,83
FEATURE, YOU KNOW, VERSUS THE EUDICOTS WE
HAVE MORE OF A NET-LIKE


32
0:2:23,83 --> 0:2:28,44
OPENLY BRANCHING SORT OF VENATION PATTERN
WHICH IS SOMETHING


33
0:2:28,44 --> 0:2:31,82
ANCESTRAL IN ANGIOSPERMS. AND WE'RE GOING
TO GET INTO THE STEM


34
0:2:31,82 --> 0:2:35,71
ANATOMY A LOT MORE, BUT I'LL JUST MENTION
AGAIN THE VASCULAR


35
0:2:35,71 --> 0:2:41,2
TISSUE OF THE CONDUCTING TISSUE THAT TRANSPORTS
WATER AND SUGARS


36
0:2:41,2 --> 0:2:47,4
THROUGH THE PLANT AND THE ANGIOSPERMS AND
IN GENERAL THE XYLEM


37
0:2:47,4 --> 0:2:50,11
AND PHLOEM, WHICH WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT,
IS IN THESE LITTLE


38
0:2:50,11 --> 0:2:53,72
BUNDLES THAT RUN THROUGH THE STEMS, BUT IN
MONOCOTS THE BUNDLES


39
0:2:53,72 --> 0:2:58,12
ARE SCATTERED THROUGH THE STEM. THIS IS A
CROSS-SECTION. YOU


40
0:2:58,12 --> 0:3:3,78
CAN SEE HOW THE BUNDLES RUN DOWN THE STEM
HERE. AND EUDICOTS


41
0:3:3,78 --> 0:3:8,34
THOUGH, THE VASCULAR BUNDLES ARE ARRANGED
IN A RING. AND THIS


42
0:3:8,34 --> 0:3:12,88
IS REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN WE GET TO TALKING
ABOUT HOW WOOD AND


43
0:3:12,88 --> 0:3:15,9
BARK ARE FORMED IN PLANTS THAT, IN WOODY PLANTS
THAT UNDERGO


44
0:3:15,9 --> 0:3:24,26
SECONDARY GROWTH. BUT MORE ON THAT IN A MINUTE.
THE LAST


45
0:3:24,26 --> 0:3:26,13
FEATURES HERE THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE
TO GET THROUGH


46
0:3:26,13 --> 0:3:32,33
ENTIRELY, MONOCOTS HAVE A FIBROUS ROOT SYSTEM
TYPICALLY, AND


47
0:3:32,33 --> 0:3:35,319
THAT'S BECAUSE THEIR TAPROOT, WHICH IS THE
ROOT THAT FORMS FROM


48
0:3:35,319 --> 0:3:40,819
THE EMBRYONIC ROOT, I MEAN THE SOLE ROOT IN
THE EMBRYO, IT


49
0:3:40,819 --> 0:3:46,319
DOESN'T PERSIST. IT GROWS FOR AWHILE, AND
THEN IT'S REPLACED BY


50
0:3:46,319 --> 0:3:50,29
ADVENTITIOUS ROOTS. AND THESE ARE JUST ROOTS
THAT ARE FORMED


51
0:3:50,29 --> 0:3:50,29



52
0:3:50,29 --> 0:3:54,94
FROM A, FROM THE BASE OF THE STEM. ANYTHING
THAT'S ADVENTITIOUS


53
0:3:54,94 --> 0:4:0,3
IN PLANTS IS BASICALLY A STRUCTURE THAT'S
FORMED FROM SOMEPLACE


54
0:4:0,3 --> 0:4:4,69
OTHER THAN ITS NORMAL ORIGIN. SO ROOTS DON'T
NORMALLY FORM FROM


55
0:4:4,69 --> 0:4:7,76
THE SIDES OF STEMS, BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
IN MONOCOTS. AND YOU


56
0:4:7,76 --> 0:4:11,68
END UP WITH A, A PRETTY DIFFUSE ROOT SYSTEM
LIKE YOU GET IN


57
0:4:11,68 --> 0:4:17,44
GRASSES, OFTEN PRETTY SHALLOW. WHEREAS IN
EUDICOTS LIKE IN OTHER


58
0:4:17,44 --> 0:4:22,66
SEED PLANTS, YOU GET A TAPROOT THAT IS THE
EMBRYONIC ROOT THAT


59
0:4:22,66 --> 0:4:25,59
PERSISTS THROUGH THE LIFE OF THE PLANT, AND
IT'S THE DOMINANT


60
0:4:25,59 --> 0:4:31,52
ROOT FROM WHICH LATERAL ROOTS ARE FORMED.
AND THESE CAN HAVE


61
0:4:31,52 --> 0:4:36,419
VERY DEEP ROOT SYSTEMS. POLLEN DIFFERS FUNDAMENTALLY
BETWEEN


62
0:4:36,419 --> 0:4:41,82
MONOCOTS AND EUDICOTS. IN THE MONOCOTS WE
HAVE THE ANCESTRAL


63
0:4:41,82 --> 0:4:45,31
CONDITION OF JUST ONE OPENING IN THE POLLEN
GRAIN THAT ALLOWS THE


64
0:4:45,31 --> 0:4:49,53
POLLEN TUBE TO EMERGE. AND THAT'S WHAT WE
ALSO SEE IN THE


65
0:4:49,53 --> 0:4:53,46
GYMNOSPERMS. BUT IN THE EUDICOTS WE HAVE THREE
OPENINGS WHICH


66
0:4:53,46 --> 0:4:58,169
IS A DERIVED CONDITION. THEY CAN EITHER BE
SLITS OR PORES.


67
0:4:58,169 --> 0:5:1,87
BUT, AND SOMETIMES YOU'LL GET POLLEN THAT
HAS ADDITIONAL OPENINGS


68
0:5:1,87 --> 0:5:6,74
TOO IN THE EUDICOTS, BUT AT LEAST THREE. AND
THAT HELPS TO


69
0:5:6,74 --> 0:5:11,79
RECOGNIZE EUDICOTS IN THE FOSSIL RECORD BECAUSE
NO OTHER PLANT


70
0:5:11,79 --> 0:5:16,26
PRODUCES POLLEN LIKE THAT EXCEPT THE EUDICOTS.
AND THEN IN


71
0:5:16,26 --> 0:5:21,63
TERMS OF JUST THE FLOWER ORGANIZATION, IN
MONOCOTS THE FLOWER


72
0:5:21,63 --> 0:5:26,85
PARTS ARE USUALLY IN MULTIPLES OF THREE. AND
THAT ACTUALLY IS


73
0:5:26,85 --> 0:5:29,57
WHAT WE ALSO SEE IN SOME OF THE MAGNOLIIDS
AND SOME OF THESE


74
0:5:29,57 --> 0:5:34,1
EARLY DIVERGING LINEAGES OF FLOWERING PLANTS
THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF


75
0:5:34,1 --> 0:5:37,96
BOTH OF THESE GROUPS. SO THIS IS THE ANCESTRAL
CONDITION IN


76
0:5:37,96 --> 0:5:42,6
FLOWERING PLANTS OR CLOSE TO IT. WHEREAS IN
THE EUDICOTS THE


77
0:5:42,6 --> 0:5:42,49



78
0:5:42,49 --> 0:5:47,19
FLOWER PARTS, LIKE THE PETALS AND THE SEPALS,
STAMENS, CARPELS,


79
0:5:47,19 --> 0:5:50,74
THEY'RE IN MULTIPLES OF FOUR OR FIVE. SO YOU
TYPICALLY HAVE FOUR


80
0:5:50,74 --> 0:5:54,48
OR FIVE PETALS, FOUR OR FIVE SEPALS. THAT'S
SOMETHING YOU DON'T


81
0:5:54,48 --> 0:5:59,24
SEE TYPICALLY OUTSIDE THE EUDICOTS. SO THERE
ARE A LOT OF WAYS


82
0:5:59,24 --> 0:6:5,949
YOU CAN TELL THESE GROUPS APART THAT ARE PRETTY
RELIABLE.


83
0:6:5,949 --> 0:6:8,889
THOUGH THE QUESTION OF WHY ANGIOSPERM DIVERSITY
IS SO HIGH,


84
0:6:8,889 --> 0:6:13,56
THEY'RE FAR OUTSTRIPPING THAT OF ALL THE OTHER
SEED PLANTS AND


85
0:6:13,56 --> 0:6:16,84
REALLY THE LAND PLANTS TAKEN TOGETHER IS SORT
OF AN OPEN


86
0:6:16,84 --> 0:6:19,729
QUESTION. WE JUST REVIEWED ALL THESE DIFFERENT
FEATURES THAT


87
0:6:19,729 --> 0:6:25,87
DIFFERENTIATE ANGIOSPERMS FROM OTHER SEED
PLANTS, THEIR REDUCED


88
0:6:25,87 --> 0:6:29,3
GAMETOPHYTES, THE DOUBLE FERTILIZATION, THE
FLOWER WITH ITS


89
0:6:29,3 --> 0:6:34,15
OVARY, THE FRUIT, THERE'S A BUNCH OF FEATURES
THERE THAT


90
0:6:34,15 --> 0:6:37,93
DISTINGUISH THEM. BUT ONE INTRIGUING POSSIBILITY
THAT MIGHT


91
0:6:37,93 --> 0:6:42,7
EXPLAIN A LOT OF THE DIVERSITY IS THE FACT
THAT THEY'VE UNDERGONE


92
0:6:42,7 --> 0:6:47,389
SO MUCH CO-EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE WITH OTHER
ORGANISMS IN REGARDS TO


93
0:6:47,389 --> 0:6:53,0
POLLINATION AND DISPERSAL THAT WE TALKED ABOUT
AS WELL AS WITH


94
0:6:53,0 --> 0:6:58,11
HERBIVORES THAT HAS LEAD TO REALLY RICH SECONDARY
CHEMISTRY.


95
0:6:58,11 --> 0:7:0,9
THERE'S A LOT OF, THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE NOW
FROM LOOKING AT


96
0:7:0,9 --> 0:7:4,66
GROUPS, THERE'S SO MANY GROUPS OF ANGIOSPERMS
THAT YOU CAN DO


97
0:7:4,66 --> 0:7:8,27
INTERESTING COMPARISONS ACROSS TRAITS, AND
SOME OF THE FLORAL


98
0:7:8,27 --> 0:7:12,11
SPECIALIZATION THAT I MENTIONED LAST TIME,
FOR EXAMPLE, BILATERAL


99
0:7:12,11 --> 0:7:18,19
SYMMETRY OF FLOWERS, TRAITS LIKE THAT SEEM
TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH


100
0:7:18,19 --> 0:7:21,97
DIVERSIFICATION, SO IT REALLY DOES APPEAR
THAT TO SOME EXTENT THE


101
0:7:21,97 --> 0:7:26,21
COEVOLUTION OF FLOWERING PLANTS WITH ANIMALS
AND OTHER ORGANISMS


102
0:7:26,21 --> 0:7:30,95
HAS IN PART LEAD TO THIS INCREASED SPECIALIZATION
AND INCREASED


103
0:7:30,95 --> 0:7:30,949



104
0:7:30,949 --> 0:7:35,9
DIVERSIFICATION. AND IN FACT, OF COURSE, THERE'S
SO MANY


105
0:7:35,9 --> 0:7:38,639
FLOWERING PLANTS THAT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW
HOW MANY THERE ARE.


106
0:7:38,639 --> 0:7:43,0
THEY'RE BEING DISCOVERED AND DESCRIBED FASTER
OR AT A SLOWER PACE


107
0:7:43,0 --> 0:7:46,59
UNFORTUNATELY THAN THEY'RE GOING EXTINCT.
THEY'RE STILL BEING


108
0:7:46,59 --> 0:7:50,8
DISCOVERED AT A VERY FAST PACE BUT, ESPECIALLY
DOWN IN THE


109
0:7:50,8 --> 0:7:55,74
TROPICS, THE RATE OF DEFORESTATION AND LOSS
OF FLOWERING PLANT


110
0:7:55,74 --> 0:7:59,669
DIVERSITY IS SO HIGH THAT THERE'S A REAL RACE
AGAINST TIME FOR


111
0:7:59,669 --> 0:8:4,66
BOTANISTS TO TRY TO DESCRIBE AND, WILL DISCOVER
AND DESCRIBE AND


112
0:8:4,66 --> 0:8:8,0
TRY TO PROTECT SOME OF THIS DIVERSITY AND
CHARACTERIZE IT IN


113
0:8:8,0 --> 0:8:11,88
TERMS OF ITS ECOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE AND ITS
ECONOMIC, POTENTIAL


114
0:8:11,88 --> 0:8:17,83
ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE BECAUSE MUCH OF OUR, MOST
OF OUR FOOD, OUR


115
0:8:17,83 --> 0:8:21,789
MEDI-, A LOT OF OUR MEDICINES, OUR WOOD PRODUCTS,
AND IN SOME


116
0:8:21,789 --> 0:8:25,66
CULTURES OUR, THEIR FUEL IS REALLY CRUCIALLY
DEPENDENT ON


117
0:8:25,66 --> 0:8:30,39
ANGIOSPERM DIVERSITY. AND SO THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT WE REALLY


118
0:8:30,39 --> 0:8:40,729
HAVE TO TAKE SERIOUSLY AND TRY TO INVEST MORE
IN.
AND ACTUALLY


119
0:8:40,729 --> 0:8:44,279
SOME OF THE SAME CHALLENGES ACTUALLY EXIST
IN THE TEMPERATE PARTS


120
0:8:44,279 --> 0:8:47,809
OF THE WORLD TOO, LIKE HERE IN CALIFORNIA
WHERE THE HERBARIA THAT


121
0:8:47,809 --> 0:8:52,59
I CARRY DOWNSTAIRS, WE'RE DISCOVERING AND
DESCRIBING NEW PLANT


122
0:8:52,59 --> 0:8:55,959
SPECIES ENDEMIC TO CALIFORNIA ALL THE TIME.
AND SOME OF THE


123
0:8:55,959 --> 0:8:59,639
THESE ARE FOUND IN PROXIMITY TO HIGHWAYS,
THINGS THAT HAVE NEVER


124
0:8:59,639 --> 0:9:3,48
BEEN COLLECTED BEFORE. THIS IS A BIODIVERSITY
HOT SPOT RIGHT


125
0:9:3,48 --> 0:9:6,509
HERE THAT'S IN GRAVE JEOPARDY IN TERMS OF
THE RATE AT WHICH IT'S


126
0:9:6,509 --> 0:9:10,259
BEING ALTERED. AND WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AND
ALL, WE'VE GOT OUR


127
0:9:10,259 --> 0:9:16,329
WORK CUT OUT FOR US, EVEN IN THE NEARBY VICINITY
HERE. OKAY, SO


128
0:9:16,329 --> 0:9:21,139
SEED MORPHOLOGY IS SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO
INTRODUCE NOW BECAUSE


129
0:9:21,139 --> 0:9:21,139



130
0:9:21,139 --> 0:9:24,55
WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
OF PLANTS AND,


131
0:9:24,55 --> 0:9:26,839
OF COURSE, AS FAR AS THE SPOROPHYTE GOES,
THIS IS WHERE IT


132
0:9:26,839 --> 0:9:30,629
STARTS. AND THIS SEGUES RIGHT FROM WHAT WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT


133
0:9:30,629 --> 0:9:35,3
WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SEED. AND SOME
OF THE DISTINCTIONS


134
0:9:35,3 --> 0:9:40,399
BETWEEN EUDICOTS AND MONOCOTS ARE SEEN AT
THIS, IN REGARDS TO


135
0:9:40,399 --> 0:9:46,36
SEED GERMINATION. SO GETTING BACK TO THE ANGIOSPERM
LIFE CYCLE,


136
0:9:46,36 --> 0:9:49,48
THE END, THE END OF IT HERE WITH REGARD TO
THE FORMATION OF THE


137
0:9:49,48 --> 0:9:53,519
SEED, REMEMBER THAT THE ENDOSPERM IS THE NUTRITIVE
TISSUE FORMED


138
0:9:53,519 --> 0:9:57,529
FROM THE FUSION OF ONE OF THE SPERM WITH THE
POLAR NUCLEI OF THE


139
0:9:57,529 --> 0:10:2,329
CENTRAL CELL OF THE FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE. AND
THE IMPORTANT THING


140
0:10:2,329 --> 0:10:5,579
AS I MENTIONED IS THAT THE ANGIOSPERMS WAIT
TO INVEST IN THAT


141
0:10:5,579 --> 0:10:9,6
NUTRITIVE TISSUE FOR THE EMBRYO UNTIL AFTER
FERTILIZATION IS


142
0:10:9,6 --> 0:10:12,73
ASSURED RATHER THAN IN THE GYMNOSPERMS WHERE
THEY MAKE THE


143
0:10:12,73 --> 0:10:16,569
INVESTMENT BEFORE FERTILIZATION WHICH CAN
POTENTIALLY RESULT IN


144
0:10:16,569 --> 0:10:22,519
WASTAGE OF RESOURCES. AND ACTUALLY THE ENDOSPERM
BEGINS TO


145
0:10:22,519 --> 0:10:26,389
DEVELOP REALLY BEFORE WE HAVE THE EMBRYO START
TO DEVELOP FROM


146
0:10:26,389 --> 0:10:30,42
THE ZYGOTE. SO THE ENDOSPERM GETS A HEAD START
DEVELOPMENTALLY


147
0:10:30,42 --> 0:10:33,17
EVEN THOUGH THE FERTILIZATION AND, THE DOUBLE
FERTILIZATION


148
0:10:33,17 --> 0:10:38,119
EVENTS OCCUR MORE OR LESS SIMULTANEOUSLY.
AND WE EVENTUALLY GET


149
0:10:38,119 --> 0:10:43,129
THIS EMBRYO FORMING THAT HAS THESE EMBRYONIC
LEAVES, THE


150
0:10:43,129 --> 0:10:49,649
COTYLEDONS, AS WELL AS AN EMBRYONIC SHOOT
TIP AND AN EMBRYONIC


151
0:10:49,649 --> 0:10:58,5
ROOT. SO THE, THE TWO MAJOR EMBRYONIC REGIONS
OF THE FLOWERING


152
0:10:58,5 --> 0:11:3,899
PLANT, THE SHOOT APEX AND THE ROOT APEX, ARE
ALREADY PRESENT IN


153
0:11:3,899 --> 0:11:8,439
THE, IN THE EMBRYO AT THAT STAGE. AND SO THE
PLANT HAS REALLY


154
0:11:8,439 --> 0:11:13,589
EVERYTHING IT NEEDS FOR DEVELOPMENT AS WE'LL
SEE SHORTLY. AND


155
0:11:13,589 --> 0:11:13,589



156
0:11:13,589 --> 0:11:18,749
AS THE SEED REACHES MATURITY, IT UNDERGOES
MASSIVE DEHYDRATION


157
0:11:18,749 --> 0:11:24,949
DOWN TO 5 TO 15 PERCENT WATER BY WEIGHT. AND
AS THAT HAPPENS,


158
0:11:24,949 --> 0:11:29,29
IT ENTERS WHAT'S CALLED DORMANCY WHICH IS
A SITUATION WHERE THE


159
0:11:29,29 --> 0:11:33,749
METABOLISM OF THE SEED ALMOST CEASES, SO IT'S
ALMOST INDETECTIBLE


160
0:11:33,749 --> 0:11:37,59
THE AMOUNT OF METABOLISM GOING ON HERE. AND,
OF COURSE, THIS IS


161
0:11:37,59 --> 0:11:40,91
A FEATURE THAT ALLOWS SEED PLANTS TO POTENTIALLY
PERSIST IN A


162
0:11:40,91 --> 0:11:46,42
SEED BANK FOR DECADES, MAYBE HUNDREDS OF YEARS.
SOME OF OUR


163
0:11:46,42 --> 0:11:51,67
FIRE FOLLOWERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT ONLY
GERMINATE AFTER FIRES


164
0:11:51,67 --> 0:11:57,29
HAVE GONE WELL OVER A HUNDRED YEARS BETWEEN
FIRES, BETWEEN


165
0:11:57,29 --> 0:12:0,879
GERMINATION EVENTS, SO SEEDS HAVE A GREAT
WAY OF BEING ABLE TO


166
0:12:0,879 --> 0:12:6,179
PERSIST, KEEP A ANGIOSPERM BASICALLY ALIVE
DURING PERIODS THAT


167
0:12:6,179 --> 0:12:13,519
ARE NOT VERY CONDUCIVE TO, TO SURVIVAL. OKAY,
SO HERE'S A MAJOR


168
0:12:13,519 --> 0:12:18,41
DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE SEEDS OF, OF SOME
EUDICOTS AT LEAST AND


169
0:12:18,41 --> 0:12:22,189
SOME MONOCOTS. THESE ARE SORT OF EXTREMES
THAT DEMONSTRATE SOME


170
0:12:22,189 --> 0:12:28,149
OF THE VARIATION WE SEE IN THE SEED. AND SOME
EUDICOTS, THE


171
0:12:28,149 --> 0:12:34,299
EXAMPLE HERE BEING A BEAN, THE ENDOSPERM DOESN'T
PERSIST. THE


172
0:12:34,299 --> 0:12:39,179
EMBRYO ABSORBS THE ENDOSPERM AND STORES THE
NUTRIENTS OF THE


173
0:12:39,179 --> 0:12:42,899
ENDOSPERM INSIDE THE COTYLEDONS, THOSE EMBRYONIC
LEAVES. SO


174
0:12:42,899 --> 0:12:47,189
WHEN YOU EAT A BEAN OR PEA, THE BULK OF THE
TISSUE THERE THAT


175
0:12:47,189 --> 0:12:50,759
YOU'RE EATING ARE THE TWO COTYLEDONS. AND
IF YOU CAREFULLY PULL


176
0:12:50,759 --> 0:12:55,59
THESE APART IN THE RIGHT ORIENTATION, YOU
CAN SEE THE TWO


177
0:12:55,59 --> 0:12:58,299
COTYLEDONS HERE, THE TWO HALVES OF THE BEAN.
AND THEY'RE


178
0:12:58,299 --> 0:13:5,97
ATTACHED TO A, A LITTLE MINIATURE PLANT ACCESS
HERE WHICH IS


179
0:13:5,97 --> 0:13:9,819
ABOVE THE POINT OF ATTACHMENT OF THE COTYLEDONS
IS THE SHOOT


180
0:13:9,819 --> 0:13:15,7
APEX, WHAT WE CALL THE EPICOTYL IN THE SEED
WHICH IS BASICALLY


181
0:13:15,7 --> 0:13:15,69



182
0:13:15,69 --> 0:13:18,519
JUST MEANS OVER THE COTYLEDONS, THE PART ABOVE
THE POINT OF


183
0:13:18,519 --> 0:13:21,629
ATTACHMENT OF THE COTYLEDONS WHERE WE HAVE,
HERE YOU CAN SEE THE


184
0:13:21,629 --> 0:13:25,379
FIRST TWO FOLIAGE LEAVES, NOT THE EMBRYONIC
LEAVES BUT THE TWO


185
0:13:25,379 --> 0:13:29,519
FIRST FOLIAGE LEAVES WHICH IN A BEAN ARE ALREADY
FORMED IN THE


186
0:13:29,519 --> 0:13:34,769
SEED. BUT IN SOME EUDICOTS THEY ONLY FORM
DURING GERMINATION.


187
0:13:34,769 --> 0:13:39,199
AND THEN BELOW THE POINT OF ATTACHMENT OF
THE COTYLEDONS WE HAVE


188
0:13:39,199 --> 0:13:42,79
WHAT'S CALLED A HYPOCOTYL WHICH IS JUST, MEANS
BELOW THE


189
0:13:42,79 --> 0:13:48,829
COTYLEDONS, THE HEART OF THE, OF THE STEM,
THE EMBRYONIC STEM


190
0:13:48,829 --> 0:13:53,139
THAT'S BELOW THAT POINT. AND THEN THE RADICLE
IS JUST THE


191
0:13:53,139 --> 0:13:58,239
EMBRYONIC ROOT, THE EMBRYONIC TAPROOT WHICH
ATTACHES TO THE


192
0:13:58,239 --> 0:14:1,699
HYPOCOTYL. AND YOU CAN'T SEE IT VERY WELL
THERE, BUT WE HAVE A


193
0:14:1,699 --> 0:14:4,819
LITTLE MINIATURE PLANT ACCESS HERE WITH THESE
GARGANTUAN


194
0:14:4,819 --> 0:14:10,369
COTYLEDONS ATTACHED TO IT. OKAY, SO IN THE
MONOCOTS LIKE THE


195
0:14:10,369 --> 0:14:16,389
GRASSES, AND THIS INCLUDES ALL THEIR GRAINS
LIKE WHEAT AND RYE,


196
0:14:16,389 --> 0:14:21,19
RICE, BUT THIS EXAMPLE IS CORN. THIS IS A
CORN KERNEL HERE, A


197
0:14:21,19 --> 0:14:28,609
CORN FRUIT. THE GRASSES RETAIN MOST OF THE
ENDOSPERM INSIDE THE


198
0:14:28,609 --> 0:14:32,22
SEED UNTIL GERMINATION. AND THEN THEY ABSORB
THE ENDOSPERM


199
0:14:32,22 --> 0:14:36,299
THROUGH THE COTYLEDON WHICH IS THE SHIELD-LIKE
STRUCTURE RIGHT


200
0:14:36,299 --> 0:14:39,749
HERE. SO THE COTYLEDON ARE JUST ONE OF THEM
IN MONOCOTS


201
0:14:39,749 --> 0:14:48,189
REMEMBER. IT'S BASICALLY, IT BASICALLY IS
A SHIELD-SHAPED OBJECT


202
0:14:48,189 --> 0:14:52,73
THAT ABSORBS THE ENDOSPERM MAKING IT AVAILABLE
TO THE REST OF


203
0:14:52,73 --> 0:14:57,879
EMBRYO WHICH IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COTYLEDON
RIGHT HERE.


204
0:14:57,879 --> 0:15:2,389
AND SO WITH THIS PARTITIONING OF THE ENDOSPERM
FROM THE EMBRYO,


205
0:15:2,389 --> 0:15:7,299
IT'S EASY TO MILL GRAIN AND REMOVE THE ENDOSPERM
FROM THE REST OF


206
0:15:7,299 --> 0:15:11,119
THE, THE GRASS FRUIT. AND THIS ISN'T JUST
THE SEED ACTUALLY.


207
0:15:11,119 --> 0:15:11,119



208
0:15:11,119 --> 0:15:15,85
THIS IS THE ENTIRE FRUIT OF THE GRASS BECAUSE
THE, THE FRUIT WALL


209
0:15:15,85 --> 0:15:20,249
IS FUSED TO THE, THE SEED HERE. SO THIS YELLOW
PART, THIS THICK


210
0:15:20,249 --> 0:15:24,199
PART HERE IS THE ACTUAL, ACTUALLY THE FRUIT
WALL, THE OVARY WALL


211
0:15:24,199 --> 0:15:29,769
IN A GRAIN. AND THAT'S WHAT WE CALL COMMERCIALLY
THE BRAN.


212
0:15:29,769 --> 0:15:33,579
YOU'VE HEARD OF THE BRAN, THE ROUGHAGE OR
FIBER CONTENT OF WHOLE


213
0:15:33,579 --> 0:15:37,859
GRAIN. THAT'S MILLED AWAY FROM THE ENDOSPERM.
AND SO IS THE


214
0:15:37,859 --> 0:15:41,449
EMBRYO WHICH IS REFERRED TO AS THE GERM, THE
GERM IN OUR


215
0:15:41,449 --> 0:15:45,879
COMMERCIAL TERMS. SO REFINED GRAIN IS JUST
ENDOSPERMS,


216
0:15:45,879 --> 0:15:49,149
SOMETHING LIKE WHITE RICE OR WHITE WHEAT FLOWER
IS JUST


217
0:15:49,149 --> 0:15:53,639
ENDOSPERM. ENDOSPERM IS ALSO THE WHITE FLUFFY
SUBSTANCE OF


218
0:15:53,639 --> 0:15:58,54
POPCORN. AND SO THE ENDOSPERM IS RELATIVELY
LACKING IN


219
0:15:58,54 --> 0:16:1,59
NUTRITION COMPARED TO THE EMBRYO WHERE THERE'S
A LOT MORE


220
0:16:1,59 --> 0:16:6,259
INVESTMENT OF RESOURCES. AND SO THAT'S IN
PART WHY IN ADDITION


221
0:16:6,259 --> 0:16:9,309
TO THE ROUGHAGE PROVIDED BY THE BRAN OR THE
FRUIT WALL THAT WHOLE


222
0:16:9,309 --> 0:16:14,79
GRAIN IS MORE HEALTHY THAN REFINED GRAIN.
IN ANY CASE THAT'S


223
0:16:14,79 --> 0:16:23,839
THE GENERAL LAYOUT THERE IN TERMS OF A EUDICOT
AND A, AND A


224
0:16:23,839 --> 0:16:28,91
MONOCOT SEED. SO SEED PLANTS HAVE A NUMBER
OF INNOVATIONS THAT


225
0:16:28,91 --> 0:16:33,149
PROMOTE OPTIMAL TIMING FOR GERMINATION. AND
THIS IS REALLY


226
0:16:33,149 --> 0:16:37,85
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SEEDLING
AT THE SEED


227
0:16:37,85 --> 0:16:40,389
STAGE WHEN IT'S UNDERGOING GERMINATION, THAT'S
THE PERIOD OF


228
0:16:40,389 --> 0:16:44,69
HIGHEST MORTALITY. THAT'S THE MOST VULNERABLE
STAGE IN THE LIFE


229
0:16:44,69 --> 0:16:47,989
OF A PLANT. SO IF YOU LOOK AT A MORTALITY
CURVE FOR PLANTS, THE


230
0:16:47,989 --> 0:16:51,269
MORTALITY PEAK IS RIGHT DURING THE ESTABLISHMENT
OF THE SEEDLING


231
0:16:51,269 --> 0:16:56,859
WHEN IT HAS TO GET A ROOT SYSTEM DOWN TO CON-,
IN CONTACT WITH


232
0:16:56,859 --> 0:17:1,199
MOISTURE SO IT CAN DRAW WATER UP INTO THE
PLANT WHICH IS EXPOSED


233
0:17:1,199 --> 0:17:1,199



234
0:17:1,199 --> 0:17:4,16
TO THE AT-, MOST OF THE PLANT, THE UPPER,
THE SHOOT SYSTEM'S


235
0:17:4,16 --> 0:17:8,69
EXPOSED TO THE ATMOSPHERE. WE ALSO HAVE TO
GET THE PLANT UP


236
0:17:8,69 --> 0:17:12,43
INTO THE LIGHT SO, THE SHOOT UP INTO THE LIGHT
SO IT CAN ACTUALLY


237
0:17:12,43 --> 0:17:16,23
START PRODUCING FOOD FROM LIGHT AND CARBON
DIOXIDE. SO IT'S


238
0:17:16,23 --> 0:17:21,54
THAT PERIOD OF TIME THAT PLANTS ARE IN REALLY
MAJOR JEOPARDY TO


239
0:17:21,54 --> 0:17:25,699
GET ESTABLISHED IN THIS LAND ENVIRONMENT.
AND SO THE TIMING,


240
0:17:25,699 --> 0:17:30,3
THE CUES THAT STIMULATE GERMINATION VARY WIDELY
ACROSS PLANTS,


241
0:17:30,3 --> 0:17:33,39
EVEN REALLY CLOSELY RELATED WILD PLANTS CAN
HAVE REALLY DIFFERENT


242
0:17:33,39 --> 0:17:37,74
CUES FOR GERMINATION, AND THEY'RE OFTEN COMPLEX.
BUT THEY CAN


243
0:17:37,74 --> 0:17:41,9
INVOLVE THINGS LIKE LIGHT AND, SOME SMALL
SEEDED PLANTS MIGHT


244
0:17:41,9 --> 0:17:45,32
NEED LIGHT TO GERMINATE. THAT MAKES SENSE
BECAUSE THEY NEED TO


245
0:17:45,32 --> 0:17:48,65
BE CLOSE TO THE SURFACE IN ORDER TO SUCCESSFULLY
GERMINATE.


246
0:17:48,65 --> 0:17:55,18
THEY MIGHT NEED A COLD PERIOD THAT SIMULATES
WINTER SO THAT THEY


247
0:17:55,18 --> 0:17:59,83
DON'T ACCIDENTALLY GERMINATE TOO SOON AND
ARE KILLED BY FROST, OR


248
0:17:59,83 --> 0:18:5,74
BY, POTENTIALLY BY FROST OR IN SOME PARTS
OF THE WORLD


249
0:18:5,74 --> 0:18:9,51
INSUFFICIENT LIGHT TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND THEY
MIGHT NEED


250
0:18:9,51 --> 0:18:12,43
CHEMICAL CUES LIKE ARE REQUIRED FROM PASSING
THROUGH THE GUT OF


251
0:18:12,43 --> 0:18:19,99
AN ANIMAL OR FROM SMOKE OR CHARCOAL IN THE
CASE OF FIRE


252
0:18:19,99 --> 0:18:23,31
FOLLOWERS. AND THERE MIGHT BE COMBINATIONS
OF THOSE CUES THAT


253
0:18:23,31 --> 0:18:28,12
ARE NECESSARY IN ADDITION TO THE PRESENCE
OF ABUNDANT MOISTURE.


254
0:18:28,12 --> 0:18:32,6
SO MOISTURE ALONE DOESN'T NECESSARILY RESULT
IN GERMINATION.


255
0:18:32,6 --> 0:18:37,28
OUR CROP PLANTS HAVE BEEN SELECTED TO GERMINATE
READILY, AND SO


256
0:18:37,28 --> 0:18:42,4
THEY'RE NOT A VERY GOOD GAUGE OF HOW DIVERSE
PLANTS ARE IN TERMS


257
0:18:42,4 --> 0:18:47,99
OF THEIR, THEIR ADAPTATIONS TO DIFFERENT KINDS
OF CUES FOR


258
0:18:47,99 --> 0:18:51,68
GERMINATION. SO IN THE PROCESS OF GERMINATION
WHAT BASICALLY


259
0:18:51,68 --> 0:18:51,68



260
0:18:51,68 --> 0:18:57,12
HAPPENS IS THAT THE SEED STARTS AFTER ITS,
AFTER ITS BEEN


261
0:18:57,12 --> 0:19:1,77
STIMULATED TO GERMINATE WHICH CAN BE A HORMONAL
RESPONSE, WE HAVE


262
0:19:1,77 --> 0:19:6,19
WATER STARTS TO BE ABSORBED BY THE SEED. IT
STARTS TO RESUME


263
0:19:6,19 --> 0:19:11,66
METABOLIC ACTIVITY. AND AS IT WELLS, IT RUPTURES
THE SEED COAT


264
0:19:11,66 --> 0:19:16,55
AND THEN WE GET THE EMERGENCE OF THE SEEDLING.
AND THIS HAPPENS


265
0:19:16,55 --> 0:19:20,59
IN TWO VERY DIFFERENT WAYS IN THE EUDICOTS
AND THE MONOCOTS THAT


266
0:19:20,59 --> 0:19:31,44
I JUST MENTIONED. SO IN THE EUDICOTS LIKE
THE BEANS WHAT WE SEE


267
0:19:31,44 --> 0:19:37,23
IS FIRST OF ALL THE, IN BOTH THE EUDICOTS
AND THE MONOCOTS WE


268
0:19:37,23 --> 0:19:42,88
HAVE THE EMERGENCE OF THE, THE ROOT. SO THE
ROOTS EMERGE FIRST.


269
0:19:42,88 --> 0:19:48,12
AND THEY HAVE POSITIVE GEOTROPISM WHICH MEANS
THAT BASICALLY THEY


270
0:19:48,12 --> 0:19:54,24
GROW WITH GRAVITY, AND THIS IS A HORMONALLY-INDUCED
RESPONSE THAT


271
0:19:54,24 --> 0:19:58,8
RESULTS IN THE ROOT GROWING DOWN INTO THE
SOIL. THE TAPROOT


272
0:19:58,8 --> 0:20:3,52
GROWS QUICKLY IN BOTH THE MONOCOTS AND THE
EUDICOTS. THEY START


273
0:20:3,52 --> 0:20:7,72
PRODUCING ROOT HAIRS WHICH INCREASE THE SURFACE
AREA OF THE ROOT.


274
0:20:7,72 --> 0:20:10,86
AND YOU'LL SEE THAT IN THE VIDEO IN A SECOND.
BUT THESE ROOT


275
0:20:10,86 --> 0:20:15,41
HAIRS ARE JUST EPIDERMAL OUTGROWTHS THAT INCREASE
THE SURFACE


276
0:20:15,41 --> 0:20:19,72
AREA FROM WHICH THEY CAN ABSORB WATER AND
NU-, AND MINERALS.


277
0:20:19,72 --> 0:20:23,94
AND IN THE CASE OF THE MONOCOTS AS I MENTIONED,
THE TAPROOT


278
0:20:23,94 --> 0:20:27,94
DOESN'T SURVIVE VERY LONG. WE START GETTING
THESE ADVENTITIOUS


279
0:20:27,94 --> 0:20:31,63
ROOTS FORMING FROM THE BASE OF THE SHOOT THAT,
THAT CREATE THE


280
0:20:31,63 --> 0:20:35,1
FIBROUS ROOT SYSTEM. SO AFTER THE ROOT SYSTEM
IS ACTUALLY


281
0:20:35,1 --> 0:20:38,86
PRETTY WELL-ESTABLISHED, ONLY THEN DOES THE
SHOOT START TO EMERGE


282
0:20:38,86 --> 0:20:44,97
FROM THE SEED OR START TO EMERGE FROM THE
GROUND I SHOULD SAY.


283
0:20:44,97 --> 0:20:49,16
AND THE FIRST THING THAT WE SEE HAPPENING
IN THE EUDICOTS THAT


284
0:20:49,16 --> 0:20:53,72
ARE SIMILAR TO THE BEAN HERE IS THAT THE HYPOCOTYL,
THAT REGION


285
0:20:53,72 --> 0:20:53,72



286
0:20:53,72 --> 0:20:58,51
BELOW THE ATTACHMENT OF THE COTYLEDONS, THE
LOWER PART OF


287
0:20:58,51 --> 0:21:6,83
EMBRYONIC STEM, IT STARTS TO GROW UP WITH
NEGATIVE GEOTROPISM


288
0:21:6,83 --> 0:21:11,79
GROWING AGAINST GRAVITY. AND AS IT EMERGES,
IT FORMS THIS


289
0:21:11,79 --> 0:21:15,97
GERMINATION HOOK THAT YOU CAN SEE THAT. AND
SO BY DOING THAT,


290
0:21:15,97 --> 0:21:19,75
BY HAVING A HYPOCOTYL RATHER THAN THE OTHER
PARTS OF THE SHOOT


291
0:21:19,75 --> 0:21:26,82
RESPOND TO, TO BE THE LEADING EDGE OF THE
GROWTH, THIS HOLDS THE


292
0:21:26,82 --> 0:21:32,3
COTYLEDONS AND THE PROTECTED SHOOT APEX THROUGH
THE SOIL. SHOOT


293
0:21:32,3 --> 0:21:35,92
APEX IS SHIELDED BETWEEN THESE COTYLEDONS,
AND SO WE DON'T HAVE


294
0:21:35,92 --> 0:21:40,61
THE ABRASION POTENTIALLY DAMAGING THE COTYLEDONS
WHICH ARE GOING


295
0:21:40,61 --> 0:21:45,39
TO BE THE IMPORTANT FOR INITIAL PHOTOSYNTHESIS
FOOD PRODUCTION.


296
0:21:45,39 --> 0:21:48,65
AND THE SHOOT APEX WHICH IS AS I'LL POINT
OUT IS THE CRITICAL


297
0:21:48,65 --> 0:21:52,47
THING TO PROTECT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOUR
EMBRYONIC TISSUE IS


298
0:21:52,47 --> 0:21:57,34
THAT'S GOING TO RESULT IN THE FURTHER GROWTH
OF THE STEM. SO


299
0:21:57,34 --> 0:22:0,84
YOU PULL THE COTYLEDONS AND THE SHOOT APEX
UP THIS WAY. AFTER


300
0:22:0,84 --> 0:22:8,31
FULL EMERGENCE, THE WHOLE THING STRAIGHTENS
OUT. AND WE GET THE


301
0:22:8,31 --> 0:22:11,6
GREENING UP OF THE COTYLEDONS, THE, THE EXPANSION
OF THE FIRST


302
0:22:11,6 --> 0:22:15,4
FOLIAGE LEAVES AND ELONGATION OF THE STEM
THAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT


303
0:22:15,4 --> 0:22:20,8
IN A MINUTE. OKAY, NOW CONTRAST THIS WITH
WHAT GOES ON IN THE


304
0:22:20,8 --> 0:22:25,1
MONOCOTS WHERE YOU HAVE, WE ALREADY TALKED
ABOUT THE ROOT SYSTEM


305
0:22:25,1 --> 0:22:29,25
GETTING ESTABLISHED. BUT HERE THERE'S A, A
SHEATH CALLED THE


306
0:22:29,25 --> 0:22:34,52
COLEOPTILE THAT DOESN'T HAVE A HOMOLOGUE IN
THE EUDICOTS. IT'S


307
0:22:34,52 --> 0:22:39,59
BASICALLY A SHEATH, A HOLLOW SHEATH THAT SURROUNDS
THE SHOOT APEX


308
0:22:39,59 --> 0:22:48,41
OR THE, SHOOT APEX OF THE, OF THE, OF THE
EMBRYO. AND IT GROWS


309
0:22:48,41 --> 0:22:51,93
STRAIGHT UP. THERE'S NO GERMINATION UP HERE.
IT GROWS STRAIGHT


310
0:22:51,93 --> 0:22:57,97
UP, AND AS SOON AS IT EMERGES FROM THE SOIL,
THE SHOOT EMERGES


311
0:22:57,97 --> 0:22:58,13



312
0:22:58,13 --> 0:23:1,57
THROUGH THAT SHEATH. AND SO IT'S BEEN PROTECTED
FROM THE


313
0:23:1,57 --> 0:23:7,85
ABRASION OF THE SOIL FROM EMERGENCE HERE AND
THEN IT UNDERGOES


314
0:23:7,85 --> 0:23:11,6
EXPANSION OF THE LEAVES AND ELONGATION OF
THE SHOOT. SO IN THIS


315
0:23:11,6 --> 0:23:15,59
CASE THE SEED AND ACTUALLY THE WHOLE FRUIT
REMAINS UNDERGROUND


316
0:23:15,59 --> 0:23:19,38
WHEREAS HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT THE SEED EMERGES
FROM THE GROUND


317
0:23:19,38 --> 0:23:22,94
ALTHOUGH THE SEED COAT IS SLOUGHED OFF AS
ITS PULLED THROUGH OR


318
0:23:22,94 --> 0:23:25,68
IN THE COURSE OF THE BREAKING OPEN OF THE
COTYL-, THE SPREADING


319
0:23:25,68 --> 0:23:29,11
OF THE COTYLEDONS, THE SEED COAT IS FURTHER
RUPTURED. WHEREAS


320
0:23:29,11 --> 0:23:32,35
HERE THE SEED AND THE FRUIT REMAIN UNDERGROUND
AS DOES THE, AS


321
0:23:32,35 --> 0:23:36,12
DOES THE COTYLEDON. BUT IT'S A REALLY DIFFERENT
SORT OF


322
0:23:36,12 --> 0:23:42,53
DEVELOPMENT IN THE CASE OF EUDICOTS AND MONOCOTS.
AND SO NOW


323
0:23:42,53 --> 0:23:46,29
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THIS PROCESS IN VIDEO,
AND SO YOU'LL SEE


324
0:23:46,29 --> 0:23:48,61
THESE STEPS. WE'RE GOING TO FIRST LOOK AT
THE, AT A BEAN


325
0:23:48,61 --> 0:23:55,2
EMERGING. SO YOU CAN SEE HERE THE ROOT'S STARTING
TO FORM.


326
0:23:55,2 --> 0:23:59,34
AND THESE ARE THE ROOT HAIRS ON THE TAPROOT.
SO WE HAVE RAPID


327
0:23:59,34 --> 0:24:3,53
GROWTH. AND NOW THAT, THAT HAPPENED QUICKLY
BUT YOU CAN, THE


328
0:24:3,53 --> 0:24:9,66
GERMINATION HOOK AND IT FORMED. THE THING
STRAIGHTENED OUT.


329
0:24:9,66 --> 0:24:12,98
HERE ARE THE COTYLEDONS. YOU CAN SEE THE TWO
COTYLEDONS


330
0:24:12,98 --> 0:24:19,51
EXPANDED. AND NOW THE SHOOT APEX HERE, THE
EPICOTYL WILL START


331
0:24:19,51 --> 0:24:27,44
TO GROW.


332
0:24:27,44 --> 0:24:30,1
OVER HERE WE CAN SEE IT BETTER WHERE WE HAVE
THE FIRST


333
0:24:30,1 --> 0:24:38,41
FOLIAGE LEAVES NOW HAVE EMERGED AND WELL ON
ITS WAY. YOU CAN


334
0:24:38,41 --> 0:24:42,47
SEE HERE THAT THE SEED COAT'S LEFT UNDERGROUND
OR IN SOME CASES


335
0:24:42,47 --> 0:24:47,23
IT'S LEFT CLINGING TO THE, TO THE PLANT. WHEREAS
IN THE


336
0:24:47,23 --> 0:24:52,0
MONOCOT, IN THE CORN, WE ALSO GET THE ROOT
SYSTEM ESTABLISHED


337
0:24:52,0 --> 0:24:57,86
QUICKLY. AND HERE WE HAVE THE COLEOPTILE GOING
STRAIGHT UP.


338
0:24:57,86 --> 0:24:57,86



339
0:24:57,86 --> 0:25:1,1
THERE'S NO GERMINATION HOOK HERE. AND AS SOON
AS IT EMERGES, THE


340
0:25:1,1 --> 0:25:7,83
SHOOT, THE SHOOT COMES OUT OF THE COLEOPTILE,
AND WE GET THE


341
0:25:7,83 --> 0:25:11,41
DEVELOPMENT OF THE SEEDLING HERE. YOU CAN
SEE HERE THE


342
0:25:11,41 --> 0:25:19,23
ADVENTITIOUS ROOTS STARTING TO FORM FROM THE
BASE OF THE STEM.


343
0:25:19,23 --> 0:25:23,38
AND SO THE SEEDS, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NOTICED
IT BUT THE, THE


344
0:25:23,38 --> 0:25:29,39
CORN'S FRUITS REMAINED UNDERGROUND THERE.
THEY DIDN'T EMERGE.


345
0:25:29,39 --> 0:25:33,27
OKAY, SO THAT'S THE GERMINATION PROCESS. AND
NOW WE'RE GOING TO


346
0:25:33,27 --> 0:25:37,6
START TO LOOK AT, ARE THERE QUESTIONS ABOUT
THIS? YEAH?


347
0:25:37,6 --> 0:25:39,44
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].


348
0:25:39,44 --> 0:25:42,76
PROFESSOR: IT DOES HAVE A TAPROOT INITIALLY,
RIGHT. YEAH, IT


349
0:25:42,76 --> 0:25:46,68
DOES. AND IT LIVES FOR AWHILE. IT WAS LIVING
THROUGH THAT


350
0:25:46,68 --> 0:25:50,63
WHOLE PART OF THE VIDEO WE SAW THERE. AND
YOU COULD START TO


351
0:25:50,63 --> 0:25:53,68
SEE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THOSE ADVENTITIOUS
ROOTS, BUT THE TAPROOT


352
0:25:53,68 --> 0:25:58,69
WOULDN'T PERSIST INDEFINITELY, YEAH. GOOD
POINT. YEAH?


353
0:25:58,69 --> 0:26:1,47
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]


354
0:26:1,47 --> 0:26:5,86
PROFESSOR: OH, THE COTYLEDON, GOOD QUESTION.
THE COTYLEDONS


355
0:26:5,86 --> 0:26:9,51
DON'T PERSIST FOR VERY LONG. AS SOON AS THE
FIRST FOLIAGE


356
0:26:9,51 --> 0:26:12,93
LEAVES GET ESTABLISHED, THEY CAN HANG ON FOR
QUITE AWHILE, BUT


357
0:26:12,93 --> 0:26:16,5
EVENTUALLY THEY'LL DROP OFF. YEAH, AFTER THE
RESERVES ARE


358
0:26:16,5 --> 0:26:20,18
EXHAUSTED IN THEM. THEY ALSO FUNCTION IN PHOTOSYNTHESIS
YOU


359
0:26:20,18 --> 0:26:28,57
SAW. THEY GREEN UP AS WELL. BUT THEY DON'T
PERSIST TOO LONG.


360
0:26:28,57 --> 0:26:35,22
OKAY, SO WE'RE GOING TO START NOW LOOKING
AT THE, AT THE GROWTH


361
0:26:35,22 --> 0:26:39,98
AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE PLANT BODY. AND BEFORE
WE CAN REALLY DO


362
0:26:39,98 --> 0:26:44,73
THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT CELL AND TISSUE
TYPES IN PLANTS. AND


363
0:26:44,73 --> 0:26:48,799
THERE'S SOME REALLY DISTINCT CELL AND TISSUE
TYPES THAT WE SEE


364
0:26:48,799 --> 0:26:48,8



365
0:26:48,8 --> 0:26:53,84
REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN, IN DIFFERENT
PLANT ORGANS.


366
0:26:53,84 --> 0:27:2,43
THOUGH THE FIRST TYPE OF CELL THAT WE'RE GOING
TO TALK ABOUT ARE,


367
0:27:2,43 --> 0:27:9,75
IS PARENCHYMA. AND PARENCHYMA IS A CELL TYPE
THAT'S GOOD TO


368
0:27:9,75 --> 0:27:12,97
START OUT WITH BECAUSE THESE ARE THE MOST
METABOLICALLY ACTIVE


369
0:27:12,97 --> 0:27:15,81
CELLS IN THE PLANT. THESE ARE THE CELLS THAT
UNDERGO


370
0:27:15,81 --> 0:27:21,74
PHOTOSYNTHESIS, RESPONSIBLE FOR STORAGE OF
FOOD, FOR EXAMPLE.


371
0:27:21,74 --> 0:27:28,4
AND THEY HAVE ALSO THE CAPABILITY OF CONTINUING
TO DIVIDE AND


372
0:27:28,4 --> 0:27:31,76
DIFFERENTIATE INTO OTHER CELL TYPES IF THERE'S
WOUNDING OF THE


373
0:27:31,76 --> 0:27:35,95
PLANT. BUT AT MATURITY THEY'RE TYPICALLY NOT
DIVIDING, AND THEY


374
0:27:35,95 --> 0:27:39,64
HAVE VERY THIN WALLS. YOU CAN SEE HERE THE
THIN WALLS OF A


375
0:27:39,64 --> 0:27:43,61
PARENCHYMA CELL THAT ALLOWS THEM SOME FLEXIBILITY.
SO THESE


376
0:27:43,61 --> 0:27:46,74
CELLS CAN BE FULLY MATURE IN PARTS OF THE
PLANT THAT ARE STILL


377
0:27:46,74 --> 0:27:53,1
GROWING. AND THEY'RE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO CONFORM
TO THAT.


378
0:27:53,1 --> 0:28:1,89
THOUGH THAT'S A MAJOR CELL TYPE WITHIN THE
PLANT BODY IN GENERAL.


379
0:28:1,89 --> 0:28:6,88
ANOTHER TYPE IS COLLENCHYMA. AND COLLENCHYMA
LIKE PARENCHYMA,


380
0:28:6,88 --> 0:28:10,22
THESE ARE CELLS THAT ARE LIVING AT FUNCTIONAL
MATURITY WHICH MAY


381
0:28:10,22 --> 0:28:13,3
SOUND A LITTLE BIZARRE BECAUSE ISN'T EVERYTHING
LIVING WHEN IT'S


382
0:28:13,3 --> 0:28:15,55
MATURE, BUT ACTUALLY SOME OF THESE CELL TYPES
WE'RE GOING TO BE


383
0:28:15,55 --> 0:28:19,73
TALKING ABOUT RIGHT AWAY ARE NOT LIVING AT
FUNCTIONAL MATURITY,


384
0:28:19,73 --> 0:28:22,42
THAT IS WHEN THEY ACTUALLY ARE FUNCTIONALLY
ACTIVE FOR THE, OR


385
0:28:22,42 --> 0:28:25,82
WHEN THEY ACTUALLY SERVE A FUNCTION FOR THE
PLANT. BUT


386
0:28:25,82 --> 0:28:31,57
COLLENCHYMA CELLS HAVE VERY, HAVE UNEVENLY
THICKENED WALLS. YOU


387
0:28:31,57 --> 0:28:34,94
CAN SEE ALL THIS DARK STAINING AREA. THESE
ARE CROSS SECTIONS BY


388
0:28:34,94 --> 0:28:39,89
THE WAY. SO YOU CAN SEE THESE, THAT THE WALLS
ARE THICKENED


389
0:28:39,89 --> 0:28:43,98
UNEVENLY HERE WHICH GIVES THEM SOME RIGIDITY
AND STRENGTH. SO


390
0:28:43,98 --> 0:28:43,98



391
0:28:43,98 --> 0:28:48,51
THIS TYPE OF CELL CAN INPART SOME STRUCTURAL
SUPPORT. BUT


392
0:28:48,51 --> 0:28:52,65
THESE, THESE CELL WALLS ARE JUST PRIMARY WALLS.
WE'LL GET TO


393
0:28:52,65 --> 0:28:56,59
SECONDARY WALLS IN A MINUTE. BUT PRIMARY WALLS
RETAIN SOME


394
0:28:56,59 --> 0:29:1,64
FLEXIBILITY. SO EVEN THOUGH THESE HAVE SOME
STRUCTURAL, CAN


395
0:29:1,64 --> 0:29:4,71
PROVIDE SOME STRUCTURAL SUPPORT, THEY ALSO
HAVE FLEXIBILITY AND


396
0:29:4,71 --> 0:29:10,9
CAN OCCUR IN GROWING PARTS OF THE PLANT. SO
THEY CAN, CAN


397
0:29:10,9 --> 0:29:13,51
PROVIDE SUPPORT IN GROWING AREAS. AND WE OFTEN
FIND THESE KINDS


398
0:29:13,51 --> 0:29:18,21
OF CELLS JUST INSIDE THE EPIDERMIS, THE OUTERMOST
LAYER OF CELLS


399
0:29:18,21 --> 0:29:23,33
ON A PLANT. AND ESPECIALLY IN THE PRIMARY
PLANT BODY WHICH


400
0:29:23,33 --> 0:29:27,95
WE'LL GET TO THAT IN A MINUTE. SO AN EXAMPLE,
LET'S SEE, FOR


401
0:29:27,95 --> 0:29:31,38
EXAMPLE, FIRST OF ALL FOR PARENCHYMA, I SHOULD
MENTION THAT THESE


402
0:29:31,38 --> 0:29:34,5
ARE CELLS THAT ARE WIDELY FOUND THROUGHOUT
THE PLANT BODY.


403
0:29:34,5 --> 0:29:37,7
THEY'RE MUCH OF THE SOFT TISSUE IN A PLANT.
SO IF YOU EAT A


404
0:29:37,7 --> 0:29:41,98
FRUIT, FOR EXAMPLE, A LOT OF THAT TISSUE IS
PARENCHYMA. WHEREAS


405
0:29:41,98 --> 0:29:45,17
COLLENCHYMA, WHAT YOU MIGHT BE FAMILIAR WITH
THERE IS IF YOU BITE


406
0:29:45,17 --> 0:29:49,87
INTO A STALK OF CELERY, THE STRINGS THAT CAN
GET CAUGHT BETWEEN


407
0:29:49,87 --> 0:29:54,88
YOUR TEETH IN THOSE, IN A STEM, IN A STALK
OF CELERY WHICH IS A


408
0:29:54,88 --> 0:30:1,21
PETIOLE OF A, OF A CELERY LEAF, THAT'S COLLENCHYMA.
SO IF YOU'VE


409
0:30:1,21 --> 0:30:4,32
PULLED THOSE OUT OF YOUR TEETH, YOU'LL NOTICE
THAT THEY'RE GREEN.


410
0:30:4,32 --> 0:30:6,79
THEY'RE LIVING CELLS, AND THEY'RE, THEY DO
PROVIDE SOME


411
0:30:6,79 --> 0:30:12,71
STRUCTURAL SUPPORT AS YOU CAN APPRECIATE.
THEY'RE PRETTY STRONG.


412
0:30:12,71 --> 0:30:18,2
SO A THIRD TISSUE TYPE OR THIRD CELL TYPE
IS SCLERENCHYMA. AND


413
0:30:18,2 --> 0:30:23,5
SCLERENCHYMA CELLS ARE DEAD AT FUNCTIONAL
MATURITY. SO WHEN


414
0:30:23,5 --> 0:30:27,3
THEY'RE FULLY FORMED, THE PROTOPLAST DIES
AND THEY BECOME


415
0:30:27,3 --> 0:30:31,84
HOLLOWED OUT. AND THEY LAY, BEFORE THEY DIE,
THEY LAY DOWN


416
0:30:31,84 --> 0:30:32,0



417
0:30:32,0 --> 0:30:37,18
SECONDARY WALL BETWEEN THE PRIMARY WALL AND
THE CELL MEMBRANE.


418
0:30:37,18 --> 0:30:40,59
AND THESE SECONDARY WALLS ARE NOT ONLY ADDING
THICKNESS TO THE


419
0:30:40,59 --> 0:30:45,32
CELL WALL BUT THEY ALSO ARE IMPREGNATED WITH
LIGNIN WHICH IS A


420
0:30:45,32 --> 0:30:50,4
COMPOUND THAT IMPARTS RIGIDITY TO PLANT PARTS.
AND SO EXAMPLES


421
0:30:50,4 --> 0:30:54,88
OF SCLERENCHYMA ARE THINGS LIKE, WELL, THERE
ARE A COUPLE OF


422
0:30:54,88 --> 0:31:0,4
DIFFERENT TYPES OF SCLERENCHYMA. THERE ARE
SCLEREIDS WHICH ARE


423
0:31:0,4 --> 0:31:5,57
NOT ELONGATED CELLS BUT PROVIDE STRUCTURAL
SUPPORT, FOR EXAMPLE,


424
0:31:5,57 --> 0:31:9,89
THE SEED COAT, RIGID SEED COATS ARE MADE OF
THESE REALLY TOUGH


425
0:31:9,89 --> 0:31:16,809
SCLEREIDS AS IS SAY THE OUTER FRUIT WALL OF
THE NUT, YOU KNOW


426
0:31:16,809 --> 0:31:20,99
LIKE A WALNUT SHELL, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
THOSE, THAT, THOSE


427
0:31:20,99 --> 0:31:26,2
ARE SCLEREIDS THAT IMPART THAT HARDNESS. AND
IF YOU BITE INTO A


428
0:31:26,2 --> 0:31:31,7
PEAR, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW, YOU'VE EXPERIENCED
THAT SORT OF


429
0:31:31,7 --> 0:31:39,39
GRITTINESS OF A PEAR FRUIT. THESE ARE SCLEREIDS
INSIDE THE


430
0:31:39,39 --> 0:31:42,179
FRUIT OF A PEAR WHICH IS OTHERWISE MOSTLY
PARENCHYMA TISSUE.


431
0:31:42,179 --> 0:31:44,27
BUT THERE ARE SCLEREIDS IN THERE THAT GIVE
IT THAT GRITTY


432
0:31:44,27 --> 0:31:51,5
TEXTURE. ANOTHER TYPE OF SCLERENCHYMA ARE
FIBERS. NOW FIBERS


433
0:31:51,5 --> 0:31:58,76
ARE ELONGATED CELLS THAT FORM THREAD-LIKE,
THEY'RE OFTEN IN A


434
0:31:58,76 --> 0:32:2,89
THREAD-LIKE ORGANIZATION. AND YOU MIGHT BE
FAMILIAR WITH FIBERS


435
0:32:2,89 --> 0:32:7,59
FOR LIKE HEMP FIBER WHICH IS USED TRADITIONALLY
TO MAKE ROPE OR


436
0:32:7,59 --> 0:32:12,7
FLAX FIBER, IT'S USED FOR WEAVING. FIBERS
ARE REALLY TOUGH AND


437
0:32:12,7 --> 0:32:17,69
IMPART RIGIDITY TO TISSUE. BUT THESE SCLERENCHYMA
CELLS ARE


438
0:32:17,69 --> 0:32:21,44
ONLY FORMED IN PARTS OF THE PLANT THAT HAVE
QUIT GROWING, BECAUSE


439
0:32:21,44 --> 0:32:28,5
SCLERENCHYMA IS RIGID AND IT CAN'T ELONGATE.
IT'S INFLEXIBLE.


440
0:32:28,5 --> 0:32:32,34
OKAY, SO ONLY IN THE PARTS OF THE PLANT THAT
ARE NO LONGER


441
0:32:32,34 --> 0:32:37,61
GROWING IS SCLERENCHYMA FULLY DIFFERENTIATED.
ARE THERE


442
0:32:37,61 --> 0:32:37,61



443
0:32:37,61 --> 0:32:43,36
QUESTIONS ABOUT CELL TYPES? THERE ARE OTHER
COUPLE, THERE ARE A


444
0:32:43,36 --> 0:32:47,25
COUPLE OF OTHER CELL TYPES IN THE VASCULAR
TISSUE, THE CONDUCTING


445
0:32:47,25 --> 0:32:49,88
TISSUE. WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THOSE IN A MINUTE.
BUT THESE ARE


446
0:32:49,88 --> 0:32:53,2
CELL TYPES THAT ARE FOUND, FOUND THROUGHOUT
ALL THE TISSUES OF


447
0:32:53,2 --> 0:33:0,179
THE PLANT, NOT JUST THE VASCULAR TISSUE. OKAY,
SO THERE ARE


448
0:33:0,179 --> 0:33:4,2
TISSUE SYSTEMS IN PLANTS AND JUST LIKE THOSE,
WELL, THERE ARE


449
0:33:4,2 --> 0:33:7,8
MORE THAN THOSE THREE CELL TYPES, BUT THERE
ARE THREE TISSUES


450
0:33:7,8 --> 0:33:10,89
TYPES. THERE ARE ONLY THREE TISSUE TYPES IN
PLANTS. AND


451
0:33:10,89 --> 0:33:15,27
TISSUES ARE JUST A FUNCTIONAL UNIT THAT CONNECTS
ALL THE PLANT


452
0:33:15,27 --> 0:33:22,83
ORGANS. AND THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF PLANT
ORGANS REGARDLESS OF


453
0:33:22,83 --> 0:33:25,98
WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REPRODUCTIVE PARTS
OF THE PLANT OR


454
0:33:25,98 --> 0:33:29,94
VEGETATIVE PARTS OF THE PLANT. PLANTS ARE
MADE UP OF LEAVES,


455
0:33:29,94 --> 0:33:33,95
STEMS, AND ROOTS. REMEMBER THE FLOWER IS BASICALLY
A, A SIMPLE


456
0:33:33,95 --> 0:33:39,4
SHOOT THAT'S, THAT'S A STEM, THE AXIS OF IT
WITH MODIFIED LEAVES,


457
0:33:39,4 --> 0:33:45,72
BOTH STERILE AND FERTILE, AND STEMS AND ROOTS.
AND THESE ALL


458
0:33:45,72 --> 0:33:52,19
HAVE CHARACTERISTIC ATTRIBUTES WE'LL TALK
ABOUT IN A MOMENT.


459
0:33:52,19 --> 0:33:55,179
AND ACROSS ALL OF THE, ACROSS THE LEAVES,
THE STEM, AND THE ROOT


460
0:33:55,179 --> 0:34:0,179
WE HAVE THREE TYPES OF TISSUE SYSTEMS THAT
ARE KNOWN AS DERMAL,


461
0:34:0,179 --> 0:34:6,2
GROUND, AND VASCULAR TISSUE. SO THE DERMAL
TISSUE IS THE TISSUE


462
0:34:6,2 --> 0:34:10,46
THAT FORMS THE OUTER PROTECTIVE COVERING OF
THE PLANT, SO THE


463
0:34:10,46 --> 0:34:13,97
OUTERMOST LAYER IN THE CASE OF THE PRIMARY
PLANT BODY, JUST THE


464
0:34:13,97 --> 0:34:17,559
EPIDERMIS, A SINGLE CELL LAYER IN THICKNESS.
WHEN WE GET TO


465
0:34:17,559 --> 0:34:22,419
SECONDARY GROWTH, IT CAN BE MORE THAN ONE
LAYER IN THICKNESS.


466
0:34:22,419 --> 0:34:27,629
AND THEN THE VASCULAR TISSUE IN PURPLE HERE
IS THE CONDUCTING


467
0:34:27,629 --> 0:34:32,879
TISSUE, CONDUCTING WATER AND FOOD, SUGARS
AND OTHER ORGANIC


468
0:34:32,879 --> 0:34:32,879



469
0:34:32,879 --> 0:34:36,44
NUTRIENTS. AND THE GROUND TISSUE IN YELLOW
HERE IS BASICALLY


470
0:34:36,44 --> 0:34:41,579
EVERYTHING ELSE. MOSTLY PARENCHYMA THAT IS
THE MOST


471
0:34:41,579 --> 0:34:45,859
METABOLICALLY ACTIVE TISSUE IN THE PLANT.
AND YOU CAN SEE HOW


472
0:34:45,859 --> 0:34:49,149
THESE THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF TISSUE WITH
THE EXCEPTION OF THE


473
0:34:49,149 --> 0:34:52,97
EPIDERMIS, ACTUALLY THE VASCULAR TISSUE AND
THE, AND THE GROUND


474
0:34:52,97 --> 0:34:56,71
TISSUE ARE ORGANIZED IN DIFFERENT WAYS IN
THE THREE DIFFERENT


475
0:34:56,71 --> 0:35:0,89
ORGANS. THOUGH THERE'S A VERY DIFFERENT ORGANIZATION,
FOR


476
0:35:0,89 --> 0:35:4,39
EXAMPLE, THE VASCULAR TISSUE AND THE STEM
COMPARED TO THE ROOT,


477
0:35:4,39 --> 0:35:7,839
AND THE GROUND TISSUE AS WELL. AND THE SAME
APPLIES TO THE


478
0:35:7,839 --> 0:35:10,95
LEAVES. BUT IT'S ALL INTERCONNECTED. IT'S
ALL A UNIFIED WHOLE.


479
0:35:10,95 --> 0:35:13,769
THESE TISSUE SYSTEMS ARE ALL INTERCONNECTED
ACROSS THESE THREE


480
0:35:13,769 --> 0:35:19,69
ORGANS, THREE TYPES OF ORGANS. BUT WE'LL TALK
ABOUT THE SHOOT


481
0:35:19,69 --> 0:35:22,89
SYSTEM AND THE ROOT SYSTEM SEPARATELY IN TERMS
OF DEVELOPMENT


482
0:35:22,89 --> 0:35:29,92
BECAUSE THEY ARE SO DIFFERENT ANATOMICALLY
AND DEVELOPMENTALLY.


483
0:35:29,92 --> 0:35:34,67
THE SAME APPLIES TO THE LEAVES ACTUALLY. SO
THE DERMAL TISSUE


484
0:35:34,67 --> 0:35:38,519
AS I MENTIONED, THIS IS JUST THE OUTER PROTECTIVE
COVERING OF THE


485
0:35:38,519 --> 0:35:41,65
PLANT BODY WHICH IN THE PRIMARY PLANT BODY
WHICH IS ALL THERE


486
0:35:41,65 --> 0:35:47,46
EVER IS IN A MONOCOT, IN MOST, ALMOST ALL
MONOCOTS AND IN ALL


487
0:35:47,46 --> 0:35:52,809
NON-WOODY EUDICOTS, THE DERMAL SYSTEM IS JUST
THE EPIDERMIS, A


488
0:35:52,809 --> 0:35:56,589
SINGLE CELL LAYER IN THICKNESS AROUND THE
OUTSIDE OF THE ENTIRE


489
0:35:56,589 --> 0:36:2,589
PLANT. AND IT'S TYPICALLY COVERED WITH THIS
WAXY SUBSTANCE


490
0:36:2,589 --> 0:36:7,489
CALLED THE CUTE- OR WAXY SUBSTANCE THAT CONSTITUTES
THE CUTICLE,


491
0:36:7,489 --> 0:36:11,13
WHICH YOU CAN SEE IS TYPICALLY THICKER ON
THE OUTERMOST WALLS,


492
0:36:11,13 --> 0:36:14,46
THE ONES THAT ARE MOST EXPOSED TO THE ATMOSPHERE
THAN ON THE


493
0:36:14,46 --> 0:36:18,659
INNER WALLS. AND THIS CUTICLE IS CRITICAL,
OF COURSE, TO


494
0:36:18,659 --> 0:36:18,66



495
0:36:18,66 --> 0:36:22,38
PROVIDE A BARRIER SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE WATER
LOSS FROM THE PLANT


496
0:36:22,38 --> 0:36:26,369
OUT INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. BUT THE PLANTS HAVE
TO BE ABLE TO TAKE


497
0:36:26,369 --> 0:36:30,94
IN GASSES, ESPECIALLY, IN PARTICULAR CO2 IN
ORDER FOR


498
0:36:30,94 --> 0:36:35,819
PHOTOSYNTHESIS TO OCCUR. SO THERE HAS TO BE,
HAS TO BE A WAY FOR


499
0:36:35,819 --> 0:36:41,529
CO2 TO GET IN. DURING PHOTOSYNTHESIS OXYGEN
IS GENERATED SO


500
0:36:41,529 --> 0:36:45,309
SOME OF THE RESPIRATORY NEEDS CAN BE MET BY
THAT OXYGEN. BUT


501
0:36:45,309 --> 0:36:50,569
SOMETIMES OXYGEN NEEDS TO BE TAKEN IN THROUGH
THE EPIDERMIS AS


502
0:36:50,569 --> 0:36:54,359
WELL. AND THAT'S DONE THROUGH WHAT ARE CALLED,
WHAT'S CALLED A


503
0:36:54,359 --> 0:37:1,759
STOMA, WHICH THE PLURAL IS STOMATA, ADDING
A TA TO THAT, JUST


504
0:37:1,759 --> 0:37:6,799
REFERRING TO MULTIPLE STOMA. AND HERE YOU
CAN SEE INDIVIDUAL


505
0:37:6,799 --> 0:37:11,869
STOMA HERE. AND THESE ARE THE PORES RIGHT
HERE THAT ALLOW AIR


506
0:37:11,869 --> 0:37:16,18
EXCHANGE WITH THE OUTSIDE OF THE PLANT. AND
THESE TWO, THERE'S


507
0:37:16,18 --> 0:37:20,749
TWO CELLS HERE ON EITHER SIDE HERE WHICH ARE
CALLED GUARD CELLS


508
0:37:20,749 --> 0:37:24,259
THAT REGULATE THE AIR FLOW. THEY REGULATE
THE SIZE OF THAT


509
0:37:24,259 --> 0:37:28,43
PORE. THEY CAN COMPLETELY CLOSE THAT PORE
IF THE PLANT'S


510
0:37:28,43 --> 0:37:32,9
EXPERIENCING DROUGHT STRESS FOR EXAMPLE, OR
THEY CAN OPEN IT


511
0:37:32,9 --> 0:37:39,13
WIDELY, ALLOWING MAXIMUM ENTRY OF CARBON DIOXIDE.
BUT THE


512
0:37:39,13 --> 0:37:41,96
PROBLEM WITH HAVING THIS OPEN, OF COURSE,
IS THAT IT IS A WAY


513
0:37:41,96 --> 0:37:45,92
THAT WATER CAN LEAVE THE PLANT. AND SO IT'S
A TRADEOFF THAT THE


514
0:37:45,92 --> 0:37:50,109
PLANT'S ALWAYS JUGGLING IS GETTING ENOUGH
CO2 INTO THE PLANT FOR


515
0:37:50,109 --> 0:37:55,789
PHOTOSYNTHESIS TO OCCUR. AND IN SOME CASES
SUFFICIENT OXYGEN


516
0:37:55,789 --> 0:37:59,999
FOR RESPIRATION BUT ALSO NOT LETTING OUT TOO
MUCH WATER AND


517
0:37:59,999 --> 0:38:4,96
CAUSING THE PLANT TO WILT. THOUGH THAT'S,
THESE ARE STRUCTURES


518
0:38:4,96 --> 0:38:9,39
THAT WE SEE ON THE EPIDERMIS OF THE PLANT,
AND ESPECIALLY ON THE


519
0:38:9,39 --> 0:38:13,75
LEAVES, AND ESPECIALLY ON THE UNDERSIDE OF
THE LEAVES OF PLANTS


520
0:38:13,75 --> 0:38:13,749



521
0:38:13,749 --> 0:38:18,99
THAT HAVE BIFACIAL OR FLATTENED LEAVES WHERE
THEY'RE NOT IN


522
0:38:18,99 --> 0:38:21,839
DIRECT EXPOSURE TO THE SUN AND THERE'S LESS
POTENTIAL FOR


523
0:38:21,839 --> 0:38:28,4
EVAPORATIVE WATER LOSS. AND ALSO THE EPIDERMIS
CAN PRODUCE SOME


524
0:38:28,4 --> 0:38:32,259
EXTENSIONS. SO EVEN THOUGH IT'S ONLY A CELL
LAYER IN THICKNESS


525
0:38:32,259 --> 0:38:36,63
AROUND THE PLANT BODY, THERE CAN BE EPIDERMAL
CELLS THAT EXTEND


526
0:38:36,63 --> 0:38:41,539
OUTSIDE THE, THIS LAYER AND EVEN MULTIPLE
EPIDERMAL CELLS THAT


527
0:38:41,539 --> 0:38:45,17
CAN MAKE UP THINGS LIKE THESE HAIRS HERE YOU
SEE. AND WE CAN


528
0:38:45,17 --> 0:38:49,17
HAVE HAIRS ON ROOTS. WE CAN HAVE HAIRS ON
STEMS. WE CAN HAVE


529
0:38:49,17 --> 0:38:52,579
HAIRS AN LEAVES. AND THEY SERVE A VARIETY
OF FUNCTION. THOSE


530
0:38:52,579 --> 0:38:56,72
ROOT HAIRS THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT ARE
COMING OFF THE TAP,


531
0:38:56,72 --> 0:38:59,999
WERE COMING OFF THE TAPROOT THAT YOU COULD
SEE IN THAT VIDEO,


532
0:38:59,999 --> 0:39:4,59
THOSE ARE EPIDERMAL OUTGROWTHS. THEY'RE JUST
EXTENSIONS OF THE


533
0:39:4,59 --> 0:39:7,43
EPIDERMAL CELLS OF THE ROOT. AND THEY ALLOW
FOR AN INCREASED


534
0:39:7,43 --> 0:39:11,539
SURFACE AREA FOR ABSORPTION TO OCCUR. AND
SOME OF THE EPIDERMAL


535
0:39:11,539 --> 0:39:16,79
HAIRS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE SHOOT SYSTEM ON
THE STEMS AND THE


536
0:39:16,79 --> 0:39:21,269
LEAVES, THOSE HAIRS CAN FUNCTION IN A VARIETY
OF WAYS. THEY CAN


537
0:39:21,269 --> 0:39:28,269
DETER HERBIVORES BY PRODUCING TOXIC GLANDULAR
EXUDATES. YOU


538
0:39:28,269 --> 0:39:31,22
OFTEN, MAYBE YOU'VE FELT STICKY PLANT PARTS
BEFORE THAT ARE


539
0:39:31,22 --> 0:39:36,45
PRODUCING GLANDULAR SUBSTANCES THAT ARE DISTASTEFUL
TO HERBIVORES


540
0:39:36,45 --> 0:39:40,4
OR MAYBE EVEN POISONOUS. THEY CAN ALSO FORM
A REFLECTIVE LAYER


541
0:39:40,4 --> 0:39:44,95
IF THEY'RE DENSELY PACKED ON THE SURFACE.
YOU'VE SEEN HAIR,


542
0:39:44,95 --> 0:39:47,93
LEAVES THAT ARE COVERED WITH WHITE HAIRS THAT
ALLOW THEM TO


543
0:39:47,93 --> 0:39:51,72
REFLECT LIGHT. SO IF THEY GROW IN A HIGH-LIGHT
ENVIRONMENT,


544
0:39:51,72 --> 0:39:54,309
REFLECTING LIGHT CAN BE BENEFICIAL TO KEEP
THE LEAF FROM


545
0:39:54,309 --> 0:39:58,189
OVERHEATING. SO THERE ARE THINGS LIKE THAT
THE EPIDERMIS CAN


546
0:39:58,189 --> 0:39:58,239



547
0:39:58,239 --> 0:40:3,749
SERVE TO PROTECT THE PLANT BODY. ARE THERE
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE


548
0:40:3,749 --> 0:40:9,529
DERMAL SYSTEM? WE'RE GOING TO TALK MORE ABOUT
IT SOON. OKAY, SO


549
0:40:9,529 --> 0:40:15,239
NOW THE VASCULAR TISSUE INVOLVES SOME ADDITIONAL
CELL TYPES IN


550
0:40:15,239 --> 0:40:19,29
ADDITION TO PARENCHYMA, COLLENCHYMA, AND SCLERENCHYMA
THAT I


551
0:40:19,29 --> 0:40:23,45
MENTIONED BEFORE. YEAH, UNFORTUNATE NAMES,
BUT WE'RE SORT OF


552
0:40:23,45 --> 0:40:29,9
STUCK WITH THOSE NAMES. VASCULAR TISSUE IS
OF TWO TYPES. AND


553
0:40:29,9 --> 0:40:32,749
REMEMBER, THESE ARE THE CONDUCTING TISSUES
THAT TRANSPORT WATER


554
0:40:32,749 --> 0:40:36,289
AND NUTRIENTS IN THE PLANT. SO THERE ARE JUST
TWO DISCREET


555
0:40:36,289 --> 0:40:40,869
TYPES OF VASCULAR TISSUE. THERE'S THE XYLEM
WHICH CONDUCTS


556
0:40:40,869 --> 0:40:48,67
WATER AND MINERALS THROUGH THE PLANT AND,
OF COURSE, FROM THE


557
0:40:48,67 --> 0:40:53,509
ROOTS WHERE WATER'S ABSORBED TO THE OTHER
PARTS. AND THE XYLEM


558
0:40:53,509 --> 0:40:57,529
HAS A COUPLE OF TYPES OF CELLS THAT WE HAVEN'T
SEEN YET, NAMELY


559
0:40:57,529 --> 0:41:4,319
TRACHEIDS ON THE RIGHT HERE AND VESSEL ELEMENTS
HERE ON THE LEFT.


560
0:41:4,319 --> 0:41:7,9
AND LIKE SCLERENCHYMA THESE ARE CELLS THAT
ARE DEAD AT FUNCTIONAL


561
0:41:7,9 --> 0:41:13,289
MATURITY, SO THE PROTOPLAST DIES AND DISAPPEARS.
AND THESE ARE


562
0:41:13,289 --> 0:41:19,519
BASICALLY HOLLOW TUBES THAT CONDUCT WATER.
AND THEY'RE ARRANGED


563
0:41:19,519 --> 0:41:23,279
TOGETHER IN A CONDUCTING SYSTEM, BASICALLY
A PLUMBING SYSTEM


564
0:41:23,279 --> 0:41:29,45
THROUGH THE PLANT. AND TRACHEIDS ARE THE TYPE
OF CONDUCTING


565
0:41:29,45 --> 0:41:34,96
ELEMENT IN THE XYLEM THAT'S FOUND ACROSS ALL
VASCULAR PLANTS.


566
0:41:34,96 --> 0:41:37,43
AND, IN FACT, THAT'S WHY THE VASCULAR PLANTS
ARE TECHNICALLY


567
0:41:37,43 --> 0:41:41,44
KNOWN AS TRACHEOPHYTES, WHICH JUST MEANS TRACHEID-BEARING
PLANTS,


568
0:41:41,44 --> 0:41:44,579
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH SOME MOSSES HAVE CONDUCTING
TISSUES, IT'S NOT


569
0:41:44,579 --> 0:41:50,489
HOMOLOGOUS TO TRACHEIDS. NOW THE TRACHEIDS
AND THE VESSEL


570
0:41:50,489 --> 0:41:54,79
ELEMENTS LIKE THE SCLERENCHYMA ARE NOT ONLY
DEAD AT FUNCTIONAL


571
0:41:54,79 --> 0:41:57,75
MATURITY, BUT THEY HAVE SECONDARY WALLS THAT
ARE LAID DOWN BEFORE


572
0:41:57,75 --> 0:41:57,749



573
0:41:57,749 --> 0:42:1,7
THE CELL DIES ON TOP OF THE PRIMARY WALLS.
SO THESE THICKEN THE


574
0:42:1,7 --> 0:42:4,979
WALLS, MAKE THEM STRONGER. AND AGAIN, LIKE
IN SCLERENCHYMA, THE


575
0:42:4,979 --> 0:42:9,539
WALLS ARE IMPREGNATED WITH LIGNIN, THE STRENGTHENING
SUBSTANCE


576
0:42:9,539 --> 0:42:13,94
THAT IMPARTS A LOT OF STRENGTH TO THE, TO
THESE PARTICULAR TYPES


577
0:42:13,94 --> 0:42:16,309
OF CELLS. AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR
THEM TO BE ABLE TO


578
0:42:16,309 --> 0:42:19,68
WITHSTAND THE KINDS OF PRESSURES, NEGATIVE
PRESSURES THAT THEY'RE


579
0:42:19,68 --> 0:42:26,2
UNDER DURING WATER CONDUCTION. THE WATER MOVES
BETWEEN THESE


580
0:42:26,2 --> 0:42:32,21
TRACHEIDS NOT BY ACTUALLY BIG OPENINGS BETWEEN
THEM BUT BY PLACES


581
0:42:32,21 --> 0:42:37,9
IN THE TRACHEID WHERE THE SECONDARY WALL WASN'T
LAID DOWN AND


582
0:42:37,9 --> 0:42:40,69
WHERE THERE'S JUST PRIMARY WALL THAT'S VERY
THIN. AND THAT'S


583
0:42:40,69 --> 0:42:45,39
WHAT WE CALL PITS. AND YOU CAN SEE PITS ALONG
THE SIDE OF THE


584
0:42:45,39 --> 0:42:48,839
TRACHEID. THERE ARE ALSO PITS HERE ALONG THE
SIDE OF THE VESSEL


585
0:42:48,839 --> 0:42:54,45
ELEMENT. AND SO WATER CAN MOVE THROUGH THESE
PRIMARY WALLS.


586
0:42:54,45 --> 0:43:1,68
THERE ARE SMALL HOLES, VERY TINY HOLES IN
THE PRIMARY WALL. BUT


587
0:43:1,68 --> 0:43:5,839
YOU MIGHT THINK, WELL, THAT DOESN'T SOUND
VERY EFFICIENT TO HAVE


588
0:43:5,839 --> 0:43:9,29
THE WATER HAVE TO CROSS THESE MEMBRANES OR
TRY TO CROSS, CROSS


589
0:43:9,29 --> 0:43:13,19
THROUGH THESE VERY SMALL OPENINGS. BUT ONE
OF THE FUNCTIONS OF


590
0:43:13,19 --> 0:43:18,91
HAVING, ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF HAVING SOME
RESTRICTION TO


591
0:43:18,91 --> 0:43:24,49
MOVEMENT HERE IS THAT IT PREVENTS AIR BUBBLES
FROM MOVING THROUGH


592
0:43:24,49 --> 0:43:28,339
THE CONDUCTION SYSTEM. SO IF AN AIR BUBBLE
FORMS INSIDE OF A


593
0:43:28,339 --> 0:43:32,7
TRACHEID, THAT'S GOING TO PREVENT CONDUCTION
FROM CONTINUING, AND


594
0:43:32,7 --> 0:43:35,549
IT'S MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR AN AIR BUBBLE
TO MOVE THROUGH THESE


595
0:43:35,549 --> 0:43:39,489
SMALL OPENINGS THAN IT WOULD BE IF THERE WERE
LARGE OPENINGS.


596
0:43:39,489 --> 0:43:44,979
SO AN EMBOLISM IN VASCULAR TISSUE CAN HAVE
DIRE CONSEQUENCES FOR


597
0:43:44,979 --> 0:43:49,649
CONDUCTION. AND TRACHEIDS HAVE MEANS OF PREVENTING
THESE


598
0:43:49,649 --> 0:43:49,65



599
0:43:49,65 --> 0:43:55,109
EMBOLISMS FROM SPREADING THROUGH THE CONDUCTING
TISSUE WITH


600
0:43:55,109 --> 0:43:59,359
REGARD TO THESE PITS. NOW VESSEL ELEMENTS
HAVE MORE POTENTIAL


601
0:43:59,359 --> 0:44:3,999
FOR EMBOLISMS TO SPREAD. BUT THEY ALSO HAVE
MORE EFFICIENT


602
0:44:3,999 --> 0:44:6,65
MOVEMENT OF WATER BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE
PERFORATION PLATES


603
0:44:6,65 --> 0:44:10,96
IN THE ENDS. YOU CAN SEE ONE RIGHT HERE, AN
OBLIQUE VIEW. SO


604
0:44:10,96 --> 0:44:16,47
THAT'S ACTUALLY, THERE ARE ACTUALLY OPENINGS,
THESE PERFORATION


605
0:44:16,47 --> 0:44:23,839
PLATES HAVE OPENINGS THAT ARE NOT COVERED
BY PRIMARY WALL.


606
0:44:23,839 --> 0:44:28,599
THERE'S NO WALL THERE AT ALL. AND SO THE ENDS
OF VESSEL


607
0:44:28,599 --> 0:44:31,529
ELEMENTS HAVE PRETTY FREE MOVEMENT BETWEEN
THEM, AND TOGETHER


608
0:44:31,529 --> 0:44:35,479
THEY MAKE UP WHAT'S CALLED THE VESSELS. SO
THESE THINGS ARE


609
0:44:35,479 --> 0:44:39,47
HOOKED TOGETHER END-TO-END AND PROVIDE FOR
A VERY EFFICIENT WATER


610
0:44:39,47 --> 0:44:42,749
MOVEMENT. BUT UNDER SEVERE DROUGHT STRESS,
THESE ARE MORE PRONE


611
0:44:42,749 --> 0:44:46,579
TO FORMING AIR BUB-, FOR AIR BUBBLES TO REALLY
MOVE THROUGH THE


612
0:44:46,579 --> 0:44:52,859
SYSTEM AND CAUSE, CAUSE A PROBLEM. SO WE CAN
GET BOTH VESSEL


613
0:44:52,859 --> 0:44:57,63
ELEMENTS AND TRACHEARY, TRACHEIDS WITHIN ANGIOSPERM
WOOD OR


614
0:44:57,63 --> 0:44:59,68
ANGIOSPERM XYLEM. YEAH?


615
0:44:59,68 --> 0:45:5,119
STUDENT: IS THERE ANY [INAUDIBLE]?


616
0:45:5,119 --> 0:45:10,72
PROFESSOR: WELL, THE TRACHEIDS BOTH SERVE
A STRUCTURAL FUNCTION


617
0:45:10,72 --> 0:45:14,65
AS WELL AS A CONDUCTION FUNCTION. IN GENERAL
THEY'RE NARROWER.


618
0:45:14,65 --> 0:45:18,42
THEY'RE MORE TIGHTLY PACKED IN THE TISSUE.
AND SO THEY IMPART


619
0:45:18,42 --> 0:45:23,769
SOME MORE RIGIDITY TO THE, TO THE CONDUCTING
TISSUE THAN THE


620
0:45:23,769 --> 0:45:26,869
VESSELS DO. THE VESSELS ARE USUALLY FOUND
IN ASSOCIATION WITH


621
0:45:26,869 --> 0:45:33,299
FIBERS, A TYPE OF SCLERENCHYMA I MENTIONED.
AND SO WE HAVE IN


622
0:45:33,299 --> 0:45:36,94
THE CASES OF PLANTS THAT HAVE VESSEL ELEMENTS,
THEY OFTEN HAVE A


623
0:45:36,94 --> 0:45:40,29
MIXTURE OF FIBERS AND VESSELS. THE FIBER'S
SERVING A MORE OF A


624
0:45:40,29 --> 0:45:40,289



625
0:45:40,289 --> 0:45:44,39
STRUCTURAL FUNCTION AND THE VESSEL'S SERVING
MORE OF A CONDUCTION


626
0:45:44,39 --> 0:45:49,539
FUNCTION WITHIN THE VASCULAR TISSUE. SO MORE
OF A SEPARATION OF


627
0:45:49,539 --> 0:45:53,92
FUNCTION THAN WE SEE IN SOME PLANTS THAT JUST
HAVE TRACHEIDS.


628
0:45:53,92 --> 0:45:58,339
AND SO VESSEL ELEMENTS ARE ONLY FOUND IN ANGIOSPERMS
AND IN THE


629
0:45:58,339 --> 0:46:1,64
THE GNETOPHYTES, THOSE WEIRD THINGS LIKE THE
PLATYPUS OF THE


630
0:46:1,64 --> 0:46:5,289
PLANT KINGDOM I MENTIONED, THE WELWITSCHIA.
AND IT USED TO BE


631
0:46:5,289 --> 0:46:7,759
THE REASON THAT PEOPLE THOUGHT THE GNETOPHYTES
AND THE


632
0:46:7,759 --> 0:46:9,609
ANGIOSPERMS, ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THEY
WERE THOUGHT TO BE


633
0:46:9,609 --> 0:46:14,47
CLOSELY RELATED. BUT THEY'VE INDEPENDENTLY
EVOLVED VESSELS.


634
0:46:14,47 --> 0:46:17,95
VESSELS ARE, ARE NOT FOUND VERY WIDELY OUTSIDE
OF THOSE TWO


635
0:46:17,95 --> 0:46:23,559
GROUPS, THE FLOWERING PLANTS AND THE GNETOPHYTES.
ALTHOUGH


636
0:46:23,559 --> 0:46:27,17
THEY'RE CONTINUING TO BE DISCOVERED IN SOME
OTHER GROUPS. BUT,


637
0:46:27,17 --> 0:46:29,95
FOR EXAMPLE, CONIFERS LACK THEM ALL TOGETHER
AND JUST HAVE


638
0:46:29,95 --> 0:46:36,549
TRACHEIDS. OKAY, THE OTHER TYPE OF CONDUCTING
TISSUE IS THE


639
0:46:36,549 --> 0:46:41,95
PHLOEM. AND THE PHLOEM CONDUCTS THE FOOD THROUGH
THE PLANT, THE


640
0:46:41,95 --> 0:46:47,259
SUGAR AND ORGANIC NUTRIENTS. AND WE'LL TALK
ABOUT EXACTLY HOW


641
0:46:47,259 --> 0:46:50,329
THAT HAPPENS SOON AS WELL AS HOW THE WATER
MOVES THROUGH THE


642
0:46:50,329 --> 0:46:54,239
PLANT. BUT IN TERMS OF THE CELL TYPES THAT
MAKE UP THE PHLOEM,


643
0:46:54,239 --> 0:47:0,759
THERE ARE TWO MAJOR CELL TYPES THAT YOU NEED
TO REALIZE. ONE IS


644
0:47:0,759 --> 0:47:5,559
THE SIEVE-TUBE ELEMENT WHICH IS THE TYPE OF
ELEMENT THAT ACTUALLY


645
0:47:5,559 --> 0:47:14,14
CONDUCTS THE, THE SUGAR SOLUTION THROUGH THE
PLANT. AND THESE


646
0:47:14,14 --> 0:47:20,68
ARE LIVING AT MATURITY. BUT THE BULK OF THIS
ELONGATE CELL IS


647
0:47:20,68 --> 0:47:24,479
OPEN IN THE CENTER BECAUSE THE CYTOPLASM IS
JUST RESTRICTED TO A


648
0:47:24,479 --> 0:47:32,809
LITTLE LAYER AROUND THE INSIDE, JUST INSIDE
THE WALL OF THE, OF


649
0:47:32,809 --> 0:47:36,779
THE CELL. AND IT'S LOST THE NUCLEI. IT LOST
THE RIBOSOMES.


650
0:47:36,779 --> 0:47:36,779



651
0:47:36,779 --> 0:47:40,38
IT'S LOST THE VACUOLES. IT'S LOST ALL THE
ORGANELLES, INCLUDING


652
0:47:40,38 --> 0:47:44,96
THE NUCLEI WHICH ALLOWS THE CYTOPLASM TO TAKE
UP A VERY SMALL


653
0:47:44,96 --> 0:47:47,869
AMOUNT OF SPACE JUST AROUND THE PERIPHERY
OF THE INSIDE OF THIS


654
0:47:47,869 --> 0:47:55,549
SIEVE-TUBE ELEMENT. AND SO IT ALLOWS THE CENTER
OF THIS ELEMENT


655
0:47:55,549 --> 0:48:0,359
TO MOSTLY BE OPEN FOR CONDUCTION. AND THESE
SIEVE-TUBE ELEMENTS


656
0:48:0,359 --> 0:48:5,19
ARE JOINED END-TO-END WITH ONE ANOTHER INTO
SIEVE TUBES. AND


657
0:48:5,19 --> 0:48:8,68
BETWEEN THE SIEVE TUBES WE HAVE WHAT'S CALLED
A SIEVE PLATE THAT


658
0:48:8,68 --> 0:48:13,44
HAS OPENINGS IN IT THAT ALLOW THE SUGAR WATER
TO MOVE THROUGH THE


659
0:48:13,44 --> 0:48:18,839
PLANT. THIS IS A LONGITUDINAL SECTION HERE.
AND AS I


660
0:48:18,839 --> 0:48:21,109
MENTIONED, THE FACT THAT THERE'S NO NUCLEUS,
THERE'S VERY LITTLE


661
0:48:21,109 --> 0:48:25,68
IN THE WAY OF THE ABILITY OF A SIEVE TUBE
TO BE ABLE, SIEVE-TUBE


662
0:48:25,68 --> 0:48:30,7
ELEMENT TO BE ABLE TO REGULATE ITS METABOLISM.
IT'S IN


663
0:48:30,7 --> 0:48:36,229
ASSOCIATION, EACH SIEVE-TUBE ELEMENT HAS A
COMPANION CELL WHICH


664
0:48:36,229 --> 0:48:41,41
IS A, A TYPE OF PARENCHYMA CELL THAT HAS A
NUCLEUS AND ALL THE


665
0:48:41,41 --> 0:48:46,16
OTHER ORGANELLES OF THE PLANT CELL. AND IT
REGULATES, IT HELPS


666
0:48:46,16 --> 0:48:50,239
TO REGULATE THE METABOLISM OF THE ADJOINING
SIEVE-TUBE ELEMENT


667
0:48:50,239 --> 0:48:55,769
WHICH IS ALIVE BUT LACKING IN SOME REALLY
CRITICAL PARTS OF ITS


668
0:48:55,769 --> 0:49:0,769
CELL. AND ACTUALLY, THE COMPANION CELL IN
THE SIEVE-TUBE


669
0:49:0,769 --> 0:49:5,499
ELEMENT ARE FORMED FROM THE SAME INITIAL CELL.
THERE'S A CELL


670
0:49:5,499 --> 0:49:9,39
DIVISION THAT RESULTS IN A COMPANION CELL
AND A SIEVE-TUBE


671
0:49:9,39 --> 0:49:12,69
ELEMENT, SO THEY'RE DEVELOPMENTALLY CONJOINED.
THEY ACTUALLY


672
0:49:12,69 --> 0:49:20,339
COME FROM A COMMON ANCESTRAL CELL THAT DIVIDES.
AND SO IF, THE


673
0:49:20,339 --> 0:49:22,99
INTERESTING THING ABOUT THE SIEVE PLATE, WE'LL
TALK ABOUT IT


674
0:49:22,99 --> 0:49:26,619
LATER, IS IF, THESE ARE REALLY PRECIOUS SUBSTANCES
THAT THE


675
0:49:26,619 --> 0:49:30,239
PLANT'S MOVING THROUGH HERE, THE SUGARS. SO
IF THERE'S ANY


676
0:49:30,239 --> 0:49:30,239



677
0:49:30,239 --> 0:49:34,799
WOUNDING OF THIS, IF THE, THERE'S A BREACH
OF THE SIEVE-TUBE, IT


678
0:49:34,799 --> 0:49:38,92
BEHOOVES THE PLANT TO SEAL THIS UP IMMEDIATELY.
AND IT DOES.


679
0:49:38,92 --> 0:49:42,29
IN FACT, IT SEALS IT UP SO QUICKLY THAT IT'S
REALLY HARD TO STUDY


680
0:49:42,29 --> 0:49:45,88
THE ANATOMY OF THESE CELLS BECAUSE THE SUBSTANCE
CALLED CALLOSE


681
0:49:45,88 --> 0:49:49,93
IS FORMED INSTANTANEOUSLY THAT SEALS UP THE
SIEVE PLATE HOLES


682
0:49:49,93 --> 0:49:55,109
HERE AND PREVENTS ANY FURTHER CONDUCTION.
THOUGH THESE, THESE


683
0:49:55,109 --> 0:50:1,589
HAVE REALLY GOOD WOUND RESPONSE TO KEEP FROM
LOSING SUGARS. ARE


684
0:50:1,589 --> 0:50:4,91
THERE QUESTIONS ABOUT XYLEM OR PHLOEM AT THIS
POINT? WE'RE GOING


685
0:50:4,91 --> 0:50:9,799
TO GET INTO IT MORE LATER. OKAY, SO WE'RE
OUT OF TIME. AND


686
0:50:9,799 --> 0:50:13,59
WE'LL JUST TALK ABOUT THE WAY THESE ARE ORGANIZED
AND GET TO THE


687
0:50:13,59 --> 0:50:14,15
OTHER SYSTEMS SHORTLY.


688
0:50:14,15 --> 0:52:14,15
