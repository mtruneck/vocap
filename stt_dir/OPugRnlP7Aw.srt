0:0:28,717 --> 0:0:30,757
'This is fucking wicked.


2
0:0:30,757 --> 0:0:34,517
'I'm almost definitely a musical genius. '


3
0:0:34,517 --> 0:0:36,397
# This is outrageous


4
0:0:36,397 --> 0:0:39,397
# This is contagious
Yeah?


5
0:0:39,397 --> 0:0:41,797
'Maybe a tattoo on my chest.


6
0:0:41,797 --> 0:0:43,877
'But of my face.


7
0:0:43,877 --> 0:0:46,237
'Yeah. Double me!


8
0:0:46,237 --> 0:0:48,277
'Feel it. '


9
0:0:48,277 --> 0:0:50,797
# So futile... #


10
0:0:50,797 --> 0:0:53,397
'She's on there. '


11
0:0:53,397 --> 0:0:58,397
'Got to get the same bus home.
Don't go. Almost there.


12
0:0:58,397 --> 0:1:2,957
'Yes. I am the lord of the bus, said he.


13
0:1:2,957 --> 0:1:4,597
'Where is she?


14
0:1:4,597 --> 0:1:6,797
'Knickers, she's not on. '


15
0:1:6,797 --> 0:1:8,517
- Hey, Mark.
- Sophie!


16
0:1:8,517 --> 0:1:11,797
- We must stop meeting like this.
- Heh, yeah.


17
0:1:11,797 --> 0:1:14,317
I was... running. Were you... running?


18
0:1:14,317 --> 0:1:18,557
- Right behind you. I shouted but...
- Of course. Stupid... music.


19
0:1:18,557 --> 0:1:21,197
- Why don't you...?
- What did you make of...?


20
0:1:21,197 --> 0:1:24,477
'Oh, no, shit, she's... I should say.


21
0:1:24,477 --> 0:1:27,437
'No, too late. Already it's too late.


22
0:1:27,437 --> 0:1:30,37
'Maybe if we hit a bump I can slip it out.


23
0:1:30,37 --> 0:1:32,117
'Or keep shtoom, ride it out.


24
0:1:32,117 --> 0:1:36,157
'Gonna need to waggle eventually
to keep the circulation going. '


25
0:1:36,157 --> 0:1:38,197
God, there's something Mark...


26
0:1:38,197 --> 0:1:41,277
- Your hand!
- Er, oh.


27
0:1:41,277 --> 0:1:45,557
I was gonna say but... I just... Sorry.


28
0:1:45,557 --> 0:1:48,757
No, no, it's fine.


29
0:1:48,757 --> 0:1:51,677
'Of course, she's giving you the book-off.


30
0:1:51,677 --> 0:1:55,357
'Women don't want your hand
under their bottoms, Mark.


31
0:1:55,357 --> 0:1:57,997
'That's been established, that's a given.


32
0:1:57,997 --> 0:2:0,917
"'She sat on it, officer,
it was an accident. "


33
0:2:0,917 --> 0:2:7,717
"'Of course it was, now get in
with the nonces. " What a disaster. '


34
0:2:7,717 --> 0:2:11,237
Oi, mate, er, can I have
some of your Coke?


35
0:2:11,237 --> 0:2:14,717
'They'll trap me
and their brothers will hack me to... '


36
0:2:14,717 --> 0:2:16,757
- I said, can I have...
- Here.


37
0:2:16,757 --> 0:2:19,237
- Look, he's a paedo!
- Paedo!


38
0:2:19,237 --> 0:2:22,797
'You're not a paedo.
You're definitely not a paedo. '


39
0:2:22,797 --> 0:2:24,797
Go home, man!


40
0:2:24,797 --> 0:2:29,317
'Those kids have no idea whatsoever
of what went on at Stalingrad.


41
0:2:29,317 --> 0:2:32,837
'Although I can in no way
compare my struggle reading it


42
0:2:32,837 --> 0:2:34,877
'with that of the Red Army,


43
0:2:34,877 --> 0:2:36,917
'it has been a very big read. '


44
0:2:36,917 --> 0:2:40,357
I'm basically wanting to meet someone
like myself.


45
0:2:40,357 --> 0:2:43,397
'That's the opposite
of what I'm looking for. '


46
0:2:43,397 --> 0:2:47,317
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.


47
0:2:47,317 --> 0:2:52,797
Now I know how whatshisname
felt when he finished the Mona Lisa.


48
0:2:52,797 --> 0:2:56,957
Knackered. So how was your day?


49
0:2:56,957 --> 0:2:58,477
Shit.


50
0:2:58,477 --> 0:3:1,757
Well, Toni came round to drop this off.


51
0:3:1,757 --> 0:3:3,597
Oh. A party.


52
0:3:3,597 --> 0:3:6,357
Did you, you know, make your move?


53
0:3:6,357 --> 0:3:10,717
No, no. She was going to Starbucks
to read a book. It's one of her things.


54
0:3:10,717 --> 0:3:15,477
Besides, the move... it's not a whole
Sophie uptight situation.


55
0:3:15,477 --> 0:3:19,637
We're just gradually sliding into
a fuck buddy scenario.


56
0:3:19,637 --> 0:3:23,277
- Fuck buddy?
- Yeah. A buddy you can fuck.


57
0:3:23,277 --> 0:3:27,837
We're both so relaxed about sex. Last
time I was there, we watched a porno.


58
0:3:27,837 --> 0:3:30,197
Four in the afternoon, just me and her.


59
0:3:30,197 --> 0:3:32,237
I mean, that's me.


60
0:3:32,237 --> 0:3:36,197
I'm not ready for the kind of thing
you're after. The whole...


61
0:3:36,197 --> 0:3:39,637
- someone to go to Waitrose with.
- Yeah, I suppose.


62
0:3:39,637 --> 0:3:43,77
'I don't want to go to Waitrose,
I want a fuck buddy. '


63
0:3:43,77 --> 0:3:47,757
'I wish I was her fuck buddy
next door, we'd do it through the wall. '


64
0:3:47,757 --> 0:3:50,597
- How thick is wall?
- Depends.


65
0:3:50,597 --> 0:3:55,837
So, er, which Starbucks does she go to?


66
0:3:55,837 --> 0:3:59,957
'Come on, come on, piss off.
I want to go to the shop.


67
0:3:59,957 --> 0:4:2,917
'Need a poo, got to have loo paper.


68
0:4:2,917 --> 0:4:7,237
'I should be able to walk out of
my own door. What's wrong with me?


69
0:4:7,237 --> 0:4:10,837
'Be great if a car just ploughed
into the lot of them.


70
0:4:10,837 --> 0:4:12,837
'Twisted broken bones. '


71
0:4:12,837 --> 0:4:15,837
Jesus, Mark! Are you OK?


72
0:4:15,837 --> 0:4:18,37
Hi, Toni. I'm fine. I was just...


73
0:4:18,37 --> 0:4:20,157
checking the letter box for...


74
0:4:20,157 --> 0:4:24,437
Sometimes they get stuck in there
and next thing your phone's cut off.


75
0:4:24,437 --> 0:4:25,877
Right.


76
0:4:25,877 --> 0:4:28,917
You know they haven't got Alpen
at that corner shop?


77
0:4:28,917 --> 0:4:31,797
- No.
- I said, "Have you got any Alpen?"


78
0:4:31,797 --> 0:4:35,397
He said, "No. "
I said, "Are you going to order any in?"


79
0:4:35,397 --> 0:4:38,397
- And he said he didn't know.
- That is a bit crap.


80
0:4:38,397 --> 0:4:41,797
It's ridiculous!
What kind of shop doesn't have Alpen?


81
0:4:41,797 --> 0:4:44,317
- I don't know.
- 'Go on. '


82
0:4:44,317 --> 0:4:47,597
I've got Alpen!


83
0:4:47,597 --> 0:4:50,677
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I mean, you can have some.


84
0:4:50,677 --> 0:4:54,637
'What are you doing?
What about the poo? '


85
0:4:54,637 --> 0:4:56,677
'Lf I can just... hold it in.


86
0:4:56,677 --> 0:4:58,877
'I think it's retreating. '


87
0:4:58,877 --> 0:5:2,77
So, here we are then. Bowl o' Alpen.


88
0:5:2,77 --> 0:5:6,757
Makes me think of skiing holidays.
We always used to go skiing.


89
0:5:6,757 --> 0:5:9,197
- Me, my mum, my sister.
- Wicked.


90
0:5:9,197 --> 0:5:12,157
I've got a sister. She's a lawyer, actually.


91
0:5:12,157 --> 0:5:13,637
'Don't boast. '


92
0:5:13,637 --> 0:5:15,717
What does your sister do?


93
0:5:15,717 --> 0:5:18,757
Not much. She's got leukaemia.


94
0:5:18,757 --> 0:5:21,437
'That's what you get for trying to flirt. '


95
0:5:21,437 --> 0:5:23,557
That's terrible. I'm so sorry.


96
0:5:23,557 --> 0:5:25,437
I suppose...


97
0:5:25,437 --> 0:5:27,477
I mean, at least it's not cancer.


98
0:5:27,477 --> 0:5:29,597
It's a form of cancer.


99
0:5:29,597 --> 0:5:32,277
Shit. That's terrible.


100
0:5:32,277 --> 0:5:35,997
My gran... died of cancer.


101
0:5:35,997 --> 0:5:40,397
Although, hopefully, your sister... won't.


102
0:5:40,397 --> 0:5:45,37
Obviously. Listen, let's talk about
something else. Something fun.


103
0:5:45,37 --> 0:5:48,877
Do you like Blackadder?
I got the Blackadder set for Christmas.


104
0:5:48,877 --> 0:5:54,397
- I never really...
- No, sure, forget it. Terrible idea.


105
0:5:54,397 --> 0:5:56,717
I know. I know something funny.


106
0:5:56,717 --> 0:5:58,357
# This is outrageous!


107
0:5:58,357 --> 0:6:0,517
# This is contagious!#


108
0:6:0,517 --> 0:6:3,37
And he's been working on it for a month!


109
0:6:3,37 --> 0:6:6,117
- # So futile... #
- Wait, this is the best bit.


110
0:6:6,117 --> 0:6:10,557
# Waaaaaaaaaah!#


111
0:6:10,557 --> 0:6:13,877
'This Grammy goes out
to my homeboys in Compton,


112
0:6:13,877 --> 0:6:16,957
'the Japanese people
who mean so much to me.


113
0:6:16,957 --> 0:6:20,517
'Mark's playing my track!
He can't get enough of that shit. '


114
0:6:20,517 --> 0:6:25,557
#... dangerous!#


115
0:6:25,557 --> 0:6:28,277
- Jez.
- What's going...?


116
0:6:28,277 --> 0:6:30,797
Toni. I...


117
0:6:30,797 --> 0:6:34,237
# And it's dangerous


118
0:6:34,237 --> 0:6:37,477
# Keep away from it... #


119
0:6:37,477 --> 0:6:40,877
'Great idea, Mark.
Humiliate your best mate just to...


120
0:6:40,877 --> 0:6:44,77
'Why didn't we play Othello?


121
0:6:44,77 --> 0:6:46,117
'I'd love to bang her.


122
0:6:46,117 --> 0:6:50,37
'Just buckle down, do your time,
like Leslie Grantham. '


123
0:6:50,37 --> 0:6:52,77
Hey, Jez, you're up.


124
0:6:52,77 --> 0:6:54,557
Yes, that's right. I'm up.


125
0:6:54,557 --> 0:6:58,877
I'm making chicken tikka.
Plus I've bought us loads of great stuff.


126
0:6:58,877 --> 0:7:1,957
Dune on DVD, Bakewell slices,


127
0:7:1,957 --> 0:7:3,797
gin, and...


128
0:7:3,797 --> 0:7:7,357
Sara Lee.


129
0:7:7,357 --> 0:7:10,757
Plus I was thinking -
you know that 30 quid you owe me?


130
0:7:10,757 --> 0:7:13,157
Let's call it quits, yeah?


131
0:7:13,157 --> 0:7:18,597
I mean, not quits but, you know...


132
0:7:18,597 --> 0:7:22,557
I'm just really, really, really, really sorry,
Jeremy.


133
0:7:22,557 --> 0:7:27,397
'Does he mind? Maybe nobody
minds about things as much as me. '


134
0:7:27,397 --> 0:7:31,117
Cos it was only a balls-up. I ballsed up.
And now we're fine.


135
0:7:31,117 --> 0:7:34,717
This'll be ready soon. We can eat it
in front of Hitler's Henchmen.


136
0:7:34,717 --> 0:7:36,677
Yeah.


137
0:7:36,677 --> 0:7:39,277
Listen, you know Kerry, cancer Kerry?


138
0:7:39,277 --> 0:7:42,317
- Yeah?
- I need to find out for a friend


139
0:7:42,317 --> 0:7:46,557
the name of that Chinese doctor she was
raving about. Can you remember?


140
0:7:46,557 --> 0:7:49,997
Sure.


141
0:7:49,997 --> 0:7:54,237
It was Dr Ying Fu Yip.


142
0:7:54,237 --> 0:7:57,597
Wang Shong.


143
0:7:57,597 --> 0:7:59,517
Pang Fang Wang


144
0:7:59,517 --> 0:8:2,557
Dang Dong Ning Po Ku.


145
0:8:2,557 --> 0:8:4,597
Oh, right.


146
0:8:4,597 --> 0:8:6,957
I see. I get it.


147
0:8:6,957 --> 0:8:9,117
You were lampooning me.


148
0:8:9,117 --> 0:8:12,117
It was a simple lampoon.


149
0:8:12,117 --> 0:8:16,637
- Hey, Jez, what's up, man?
- Super Hans.


150
0:8:16,637 --> 0:8:19,677
Pint of Guinness, please.
No logo on the foam.


151
0:8:19,677 --> 0:8:22,197
- No logo?
- You don't buy into that, do ya?


152
0:8:22,197 --> 0:8:26,77
The old, "Ooh, I've got a clover
in me foam.


153
0:8:26,77 --> 0:8:28,117
"I'm so important. " No.


154
0:8:28,117 --> 0:8:33,157
What you're doing there is you're
drinking an advert, ain't ya, eh, shithead?


155
0:8:33,157 --> 0:8:35,637
- Thank you.
- Right.


156
0:8:35,637 --> 0:8:38,837
- So you got our track?
- Er, no.


157
0:8:38,837 --> 0:8:41,157
I've been thinking, I'm not sure.


158
0:8:41,157 --> 0:8:43,597
I think maybe it's shit.


159
0:8:43,597 --> 0:8:46,677
Whoa. Hold it, cowboy. Rewind. Wash it.


160
0:8:46,677 --> 0:8:49,997
The track's shit?
Jez, the track's THE shit.


161
0:8:49,997 --> 0:8:53,77
It's just I found Mark laughing at it.


162
0:8:53,77 --> 0:8:57,117
What, so, Mr fuckin' Ocean Colour Pants
don't get it?


163
0:8:57,117 --> 0:8:58,717
Quelle fuckin' surprise.


164
0:8:58,717 --> 0:9:1,317
Plus he was doing it in front of Toni.


165
0:9:1,317 --> 0:9:3,997
Mate, you gotta get some rewengay.


166
0:9:3,997 --> 0:9:5,637
He broke omertà.


167
0:9:5,637 --> 0:9:7,677
- You think?
- Listen,


168
0:9:7,677 --> 0:9:11,77
the whole industry is run
by suits like your mate.


169
0:9:11,77 --> 0:9:14,597
- Is that why we haven't got a deal?
- Course. They're all Marks.


170
0:9:14,597 --> 0:9:17,757
Sitting at marble desks,
ties done up to eleven,


171
0:9:17,757 --> 0:9:20,797
clicking their fingers
to the Lighthouse Family,


172
0:9:20,797 --> 0:9:23,197
getting their dick sucked by an Alsatian.


173
0:9:23,197 --> 0:9:24,717
Yeah?


174
0:9:24,717 --> 0:9:28,157
They're all perverts, mate.
All in with each other.


175
0:9:28,157 --> 0:9:31,517
It's not who you know, it's who you blow.


176
0:9:31,517 --> 0:9:33,157
Right.


177
0:9:33,157 --> 0:9:35,637
'So Toni scares me.


178
0:9:35,637 --> 0:9:39,917
'I can have a relationship with someone
that scares me. Look at me and Dad. '


179
0:9:39,917 --> 0:9:42,757
'Oh, shit. Relax, relax, it's OK.


180
0:9:42,757 --> 0:9:47,437
'You're not a paedo, you're just a normal
man walking past some simple children. '


181
0:9:47,437 --> 0:9:50,117
- Hi there.
- Look, it's Clean Shirt.


182
0:9:50,117 --> 0:9:52,917
'Clean Shirt? Isn't that good? '


183
0:9:52,917 --> 0:9:57,637
- How do you get that shirt so clean?
- 'Use the power of reason. '


184
0:9:57,637 --> 0:10:2,957
Look, I know it must be difficult
being a kid. Not a lot of schemes.


185
0:10:2,957 --> 0:10:6,757
But... You know, I'm not the borough.
I wish I was but...


186
0:10:6,757 --> 0:10:10,677
- Fuck off, Clean Shirt.
- I'm just a man. Can't we just...?


187
0:10:10,677 --> 0:10:13,237
Hey, no! No! Kicking's not...


188
0:10:13,237 --> 0:10:16,77
Don't kick my foot! That's my... Stop it!


189
0:10:16,77 --> 0:10:21,117
Don't kick my foot!


190
0:10:21,117 --> 0:10:23,637
'Me and Toni, Toni and me.


191
0:10:23,637 --> 0:10:27,197
'When his kooky charm starts to cloy,
I'll be there.


192
0:10:27,197 --> 0:10:29,237
'Fuck buddy number two.


193
0:10:29,237 --> 0:10:33,157
'Great. Wait for the crumbs to fall
while my nuts slowly shrivel.


194
0:10:33,157 --> 0:10:35,517
'Actually, I hope they do shrivel... '


195
0:10:35,517 --> 0:10:37,557
- Oh!
- What's the matter?


196
0:10:37,557 --> 0:10:40,477
I thought you liked pork.


197
0:10:40,477 --> 0:10:43,117
How did...? What does it mean?


198
0:10:43,117 --> 0:10:45,477
It means... omertà.


199
0:10:45,477 --> 0:10:47,877
It means rewengay.


200
0:10:47,877 --> 0:10:52,77
I'm sorry, OK? I'm sorry I humiliated you
in front of Toni.


201
0:10:52,77 --> 0:10:55,437
Don't think I can't see you
trying to get a slice of my action


202
0:10:55,437 --> 0:10:57,477
because Sophie won't put out.


203
0:10:57,477 --> 0:11:2,317
Oh, the gloves are off? Perhaps you
should know what I think of your music.


204
0:11:2,317 --> 0:11:5,277
Well, let's have some more truth,
shall we?


205
0:11:5,277 --> 0:11:7,957
Cos the truth is you're a posh spaz.


206
0:11:7,957 --> 0:11:11,837
Oh, really? I'd love to know
in what way I am a posh spaz.


207
0:11:11,837 --> 0:11:14,517
In the way that you do
posh spazzy things


208
0:11:14,517 --> 0:11:17,397
like tidying up and ironing your socks.


209
0:11:17,397 --> 0:11:19,437
I do not iron my socks.


210
0:11:19,437 --> 0:11:27,37
Socks, shirt, whatever.


211
0:11:27,37 --> 0:11:30,837
'I'm going to the party
and I'll get her in the end.


212
0:11:30,837 --> 0:11:34,557
'I have the power of the brain -
the most erotic muscle.


213
0:11:34,557 --> 0:11:42,237
'A longbow beats the crossbow,
my idiotic friend. '


214
0:11:42,237 --> 0:11:45,877
Hey, look, just lay off.


215
0:11:45,877 --> 0:11:48,997
- That's my bit of lager!
- Oh, I get it.


216
0:11:48,997 --> 0:11:52,157
- Are you gonna do me in?
- Don't be ridiculous.


217
0:11:52,157 --> 0:11:55,997
Are you gonna punch me, Mark?
Is that what's going to happen?


218
0:11:55,997 --> 0:11:59,157
You just... You... You're lucky I don't...


219
0:11:59,157 --> 0:12:2,77
- You're just very lucky.
- You're an animal.


220
0:12:2,77 --> 0:12:4,357
You keep your tie done up to eleven


221
0:12:4,357 --> 0:12:8,197
otherwise all this grey office envy sludge
will spill out.


222
0:12:8,197 --> 0:12:10,237
And you've got weird nuts!


223
0:12:10,237 --> 0:12:12,557
What? How did you...?


224
0:12:12,557 --> 0:12:22,317
If you're watching TV in your dressing
gown, you should put some pants on.


225
0:12:22,317 --> 0:12:25,397
So I'm glad we cleared the air.


226
0:12:25,397 --> 0:12:27,37
Me too.


227
0:12:27,37 --> 0:12:29,677
I feel better. Much better.


228
0:12:29,677 --> 0:12:31,717
Like a weight has been lifted.


229
0:12:31,717 --> 0:12:38,237
Me too. That's exactly how I feel.


230
0:12:38,237 --> 0:12:41,317
Hey, hey, hey. It's the guys.


231
0:12:41,317 --> 0:12:47,197
Come on in.


232
0:12:47,197 --> 0:12:49,237
So... Toni's friends.


233
0:12:49,237 --> 0:12:51,717
Who, what, why, and where?


234
0:12:51,717 --> 0:12:54,677
Well, that's the fun - I don't know anyone!


235
0:12:54,677 --> 0:12:57,517
- These are our neighbours.
- Neighbours?


236
0:12:57,517 --> 0:12:59,677
Did you think I'd invited friends?


237
0:12:59,677 --> 0:13:2,717
You know who your friends are when
you set fire to Hampton Court maze


238
0:13:2,717 --> 0:13:4,757
because you can't take
your husband's shit.


239
0:13:4,757 --> 0:13:8,597
It's great to know your neighbours,
not just for security...


240
0:13:8,597 --> 0:13:11,157
Right, exactly. Drinks?


241
0:13:11,157 --> 0:13:15,157
Wicked.


242
0:13:15,157 --> 0:13:20,317
'If I laugh at everything she says,
I'll at least get a suck job. '


243
0:13:20,317 --> 0:13:24,757
'I should forget it, leave her
to him. Concentrate on the long game.


244
0:13:24,757 --> 0:13:27,597
'Work on a six-pack by Christmas, then...


245
0:13:27,597 --> 0:13:32,957
'Why should I? We had something going
when we were laughing at Jeremy. '


246
0:13:32,957 --> 0:13:37,397
'Oh, too late. They're bonding. '


247
0:13:37,397 --> 0:13:46,277
- What's funny? It's a fridge magnet.
- I know but it looks just like a fried egg.


248
0:13:46,277 --> 0:13:50,397
'Heh-heh. Twot. '


249
0:13:50,397 --> 0:13:53,677
But if I pull out now,
that's the deposit gone.


250
0:13:53,677 --> 0:13:55,877
Right. Nightmare.


251
0:13:55,877 --> 0:13:59,597
- On the other hand...
- 'How did I get trapped with her?


252
0:13:59,597 --> 0:14:2,37
'She's the most boring person here.


253
0:14:2,37 --> 0:14:8,477
'They look great. They might be talking
about making a porno. I'll do the music. '


254
0:14:8,477 --> 0:14:11,197
So where do you live in the building?


255
0:14:11,197 --> 0:14:13,877
Oh, I don't live here, I'm Toni's sister.


256
0:14:13,877 --> 0:14:18,37
- And what do you do?
- I work in the music business.


257
0:14:18,37 --> 0:14:20,797
You do?


258
0:14:20,797 --> 0:14:24,757
Well, that's amazing.
That's just really amazing.


259
0:14:24,757 --> 0:14:27,477
Everyone writes down
someone famous.


260
0:14:27,477 --> 0:14:29,997
We swap, put them on our foreheads,


261
0:14:29,997 --> 0:14:35,317
and you work out who we are by asking
questions. It's really funny because...


262
0:14:35,317 --> 0:14:38,837
Anyway, let's just play.


263
0:14:38,837 --> 0:14:42,477
'Heh-heh. Yeah, this is it.
Paula's gonna love this.


264
0:14:42,477 --> 0:14:46,917
'Very Iggy. '


265
0:14:46,917 --> 0:14:50,437
No, when you've finished,
drop your Rizla in the bowl.


266
0:14:50,437 --> 0:14:53,317
Oh. Er, I'll... Could I do mine again?


267
0:14:53,317 --> 0:14:55,757
We're not playing for points, mate.


268
0:14:55,757 --> 0:14:58,717
Come on, just drop it in, old chap.


269
0:14:58,717 --> 0:15:0,477
That's it.


270
0:15:0,477 --> 0:15:4,357
- I give up.
- No, don't. Just one... This one's mine.


271
0:15:4,357 --> 0:15:7,397
- Tim Henman?
- Yeah, how did you...?


272
0:15:7,397 --> 0:15:11,357
- Jeremy, have you worked out your...?
- Don't even go there.


273
0:15:11,357 --> 0:15:14,677
It is literally impossible.
I'm just someone's secretary.


274
0:15:14,677 --> 0:15:19,157
- The Home Secretary, Jeremy.
- Yeah, right, whatever.


275
0:15:19,157 --> 0:15:21,917
- We're popping next door.
- You're going?


276
0:15:21,917 --> 0:15:24,317
'The coast is clear! '


277
0:15:24,317 --> 0:15:27,517
Yeah, I'm taking Paula
to listen to my work.


278
0:15:27,517 --> 0:15:30,757
She seems like she'd appreciate
a good track.


279
0:15:30,757 --> 0:15:34,197
Cool! Don't do anything
I wouldn't do, sis. Ha-ha!


280
0:15:34,197 --> 0:15:36,957
Which leaves her a hell of a lot of leeway!


281
0:15:36,957 --> 0:15:39,957
'Heh-heh-heh. I am in here!


282
0:15:39,957 --> 0:15:42,517
'Sis... Sister! Shit! '


283
0:15:42,517 --> 0:15:44,477
Excuse me.


284
0:15:44,477 --> 0:15:49,597
- Jez, can I have a word?
- Yeah, I'm going, the coast is clear.


285
0:15:49,597 --> 0:15:53,357
I don't expect you'll get very far
but by all means have a pop.


286
0:15:53,357 --> 0:15:56,237
I thought I'd better tell you. Paula, she's...


287
0:15:56,237 --> 0:15:58,277
She has cancer.


288
0:15:58,277 --> 0:16:0,917
What? Are you serious?


289
0:16:0,917 --> 0:16:4,717
I thought I'd better mention it.
You don't wanna drop a clanger.


290
0:16:4,717 --> 0:16:7,37
No. Right.


291
0:16:7,37 --> 0:16:8,597
Blimey.


292
0:16:8,597 --> 0:16:10,477
Is it Jamie Oliver?


293
0:16:10,477 --> 0:16:14,517
Look, you're a cockmuncher, OK?


294
0:16:14,517 --> 0:16:16,517
# Feel it, yeah#


295
0:16:16,517 --> 0:16:20,837
'You can't catch cancer.
I'd have heard. Someone would've said. '


296
0:16:20,837 --> 0:16:25,637
OK, I think I've heard enough.


297
0:16:25,637 --> 0:16:28,797
- Yeah. It's OK.
- Do you really think so?


298
0:16:28,797 --> 0:16:31,997
'What kind? Blood? Bone? Knee? Face? '


299
0:16:31,997 --> 0:16:34,717
- Yeah, I mean, I like it.
- Great!


300
0:16:34,717 --> 0:16:36,717
I mean, that's great.


301
0:16:36,717 --> 0:16:42,157
But I'm guessing you didn't invite me
to your room just to listen to some tape.


302
0:16:42,157 --> 0:16:45,317
'Shit. Of Course. "It's who you blow. "'


303
0:16:45,317 --> 0:16:49,357
No. No, sure. I know the rules.


304
0:16:49,357 --> 0:16:55,117
Yeah, let's get it on... baby.


305
0:16:55,117 --> 0:16:57,317
Barry.


306
0:16:57,317 --> 0:17:2,357
That guy is one serious power tripper.
He was all over my Rizla game.


307
0:17:2,357 --> 0:17:5,517
'OK, Mark, you asked for it,
now you've got it.


308
0:17:5,517 --> 0:17:9,717
'She's looking for a fuck buddy.
Change gears, sauce things up. '


309
0:17:9,717 --> 0:17:13,477
He's just so, "Yah, take the A304."


310
0:17:13,477 --> 0:17:16,917
I mean, yes! We can see your hairy chest.


311
0:17:16,917 --> 0:17:18,957
And no, we're not impressed!


312
0:17:18,957 --> 0:17:24,677
Yeah, so, er, Jeremy tells me
you two watched a porno together.


313
0:17:24,677 --> 0:17:26,717
You know, I'd be into...


314
0:17:26,717 --> 0:17:28,997
No, that was The English Patient.


315
0:17:28,997 --> 0:17:32,837
'Ha! What an idiotic boob.
He's out, I'm in.


316
0:17:32,837 --> 0:17:35,637
'Now, what's my shtick? Yeah... '


317
0:17:35,637 --> 0:17:41,477
You know, the Red Army shot 16,000
of their own men at Stalingrad.


318
0:17:41,477 --> 0:17:43,117
OK.


319
0:17:43,117 --> 0:17:47,157
And of course, the majority of
the Wehrmacht had no winter clothing.


320
0:17:47,157 --> 0:17:49,197
'I'm the tank commander now, Barry. '


321
0:17:49,197 --> 0:17:54,677
I know how they feel. You buy classic
but classic keeps changing.


322
0:17:54,677 --> 0:17:57,957
See, by the winter of '42,


323
0:17:57,957 --> 0:18:0,477
the whole city was surrounded


324
0:18:0,477 --> 0:18:3,517
by the massed Sixth Army.


325
0:18:3,517 --> 0:18:5,677
It was pressing...


326
0:18:5,677 --> 0:18:8,77
and pressing.


327
0:18:8,77 --> 0:18:12,557
The Russians couldn't hold on
much longer. Many wanted to submit.


328
0:18:12,557 --> 0:18:17,517
Mark, I don't just bang anyone.
I'm not some next-door fuck jar.


329
0:18:17,517 --> 0:18:20,957
No. No, of course not.


330
0:18:20,957 --> 0:18:25,557
What I mean is that the German
supply lines were stretched.


331
0:18:25,557 --> 0:18:27,997
Zhukov countered...


332
0:18:27,997 --> 0:18:31,717
and the siege was broken.


333
0:18:31,717 --> 0:18:36,517
And that's all the story of Stalingrad.


334
0:18:36,517 --> 0:18:39,957
'You're a sunshine coach,
bringing a last smile to... '


335
0:18:39,957 --> 0:18:43,837
Erm, if we've got to do this,
do you mind keeping the hat on?


336
0:18:43,837 --> 0:18:45,837
It's just...


337
0:18:45,837 --> 0:18:48,837
- Sorry.
- We don't have to do anything, Jeremy.


338
0:18:48,837 --> 0:18:51,157
- No?
- No.


339
0:18:51,157 --> 0:18:54,77
I mean, I don't mind. I'd just rather not...


340
0:18:54,77 --> 0:18:57,437
We could take Polaroids of me,
you know, all excited


341
0:18:57,437 --> 0:18:59,957
and you could take them away...


342
0:18:59,957 --> 0:19:5,797
I am very keen to sort you out,
so to speak.


343
0:19:5,797 --> 0:19:7,277
'That was embarrassing.


344
0:19:7,277 --> 0:19:10,637
"'Not a fuck jar".
Don't dwell. No need to dwell.


345
0:19:10,637 --> 0:19:14,197
'Think charming, considerate. '


346
0:19:14,197 --> 0:19:17,477
So your sister,
she looks great considering...


347
0:19:17,477 --> 0:19:20,157
Considering what?
She doesn't have any dress sense?


348
0:19:20,157 --> 0:19:23,877
No. You know, the whole thing,
the leukaemia.


349
0:19:23,877 --> 0:19:27,757
Oh, no, that's not Paula.
Paula's my half-sister.


350
0:19:27,757 --> 0:19:32,677
Paula's doing fine! Except her idea
of a present is a bunch of CD singles,


351
0:19:32,677 --> 0:19:35,357
and I do know you get them for free.


352
0:19:35,357 --> 0:19:40,437
Toni, we're dry. I was thinking someone
should run to the offy before it shuts.


353
0:19:40,437 --> 0:19:43,717
'The second front.
I can win on the second front.


354
0:19:43,717 --> 0:19:47,357
'This is perfect. I'm gonna be
the knight on horseback


355
0:19:47,357 --> 0:19:51,437
'with an armful of booze and enough
nachos to feed the Mexican army.


356
0:19:51,437 --> 0:19:55,877
'Oh, shit. Shit! Fuck off.
Why don't you fuck the fuck off?


357
0:19:55,877 --> 0:19:59,277
'Just run the gauntlet.
The little bastards will...


358
0:19:59,277 --> 0:20:1,637
'It's gonna shut as well. '


359
0:20:1,637 --> 0:20:3,637
Er, excuse me, mate.


360
0:20:3,637 --> 0:20:6,77
Er, sorry to bother you.


361
0:20:6,77 --> 0:20:8,357
This is a bit embarrassing, really.


362
0:20:8,357 --> 0:20:12,157
You couldn't possibly buy me
a couple of bottles of wine?


363
0:20:12,157 --> 0:20:14,557
Pinot grigio, maybe. Or...


364
0:20:14,557 --> 0:20:17,197
Oi! Look, it's that paedo!


365
0:20:17,197 --> 0:20:21,197
- Ha-haaa!
- Paedo.


366
0:20:21,197 --> 0:20:23,797
But on the song, do you really like it?


367
0:20:23,797 --> 0:20:26,597
Yeah, it's hard to get that excited about.


368
0:20:26,597 --> 0:20:28,757
I guess you're not
in the right frame of mind...


369
0:20:28,757 --> 0:20:31,157
'Don't go on about it. Jesus. '


370
0:20:31,157 --> 0:20:34,797
- Are you gonna do more work on it?
- 'How much time has she got? '


371
0:20:34,797 --> 0:20:38,877
Maybe. I mean, how long are you
planning to... stay in your job?


372
0:20:38,877 --> 0:20:44,317
- Oh, you know, as long as I last.
- Right.


373
0:20:44,317 --> 0:20:48,717
- Look, should you be doing that?
- Probably not. But, you know, fuck it.


374
0:20:48,717 --> 0:20:50,877
Jesus.


375
0:20:50,877 --> 0:20:54,597
You know, I do think you're brave.


376
0:20:54,597 --> 0:20:57,837
I just think you're very, very brave.


377
0:20:57,837 --> 0:21:1,517
I make my decisions, I stick by them.


378
0:21:1,517 --> 0:21:5,797
Everybody said you couldn't market
acid jazz to the over 30s,


379
0:21:5,797 --> 0:21:9,917
and I was like, "Fuck that shit. "


380
0:21:9,917 --> 0:21:14,597
Listen to you, you beautiful, crazy thing.


381
0:21:14,597 --> 0:21:17,397
I meant the cancer.


382
0:21:17,397 --> 0:21:19,437
I'm sorry... which cancer?


383
0:21:19,437 --> 0:21:22,437
The bloody cancer eating you away.


384
0:21:22,437 --> 0:21:24,437
OK.


385
0:21:24,437 --> 0:21:27,637
Would you like it if I did have cancer?


386
0:21:27,637 --> 0:21:31,757
'I bet Zhukov
would've got booze. Oh. '


387
0:21:31,757 --> 0:21:36,517
Oh. You're back. I think it's winding
down a bit now, actually, mate.


388
0:21:36,517 --> 0:21:39,557
- 'Bastard. '
- Oh, yeah, very funny!


389
0:21:39,557 --> 0:21:43,157
I suppose you think cancer is just
this huge practical joke!


390
0:21:43,157 --> 0:21:46,317
What? Oh, Jeremy, I'm so sorry.


391
0:21:46,317 --> 0:21:48,517
- I thought...
- You're quite the guy.


392
0:21:48,517 --> 0:21:52,757
Certainly not the kind of sicko
to ruin someone's music career


393
0:21:52,757 --> 0:21:56,357
by suggesting that certain people
have cancer.


394
0:21:56,357 --> 0:21:59,637
What joke is next?
"Hey, Jez, your mum's dead!"


395
0:21:59,637 --> 0:22:1,877
- Bloody hilarious.
- What's going on?


396
0:22:1,877 --> 0:22:4,997
I accidentally told him Paula had cancer.


397
0:22:4,997 --> 0:22:10,277
Jeremy, Mark got it wrong. He thought
Paula was ill. She's not, it was a mistake.


398
0:22:10,277 --> 0:22:13,517
I'm sure Kerry would be rolling
round the floor


399
0:22:13,517 --> 0:22:17,397
except she's head to toe
in acupuncture needles.


400
0:22:17,397 --> 0:22:22,477
I made a mistake. You wouldn't give
the name of the doctor for Toni's sister.


401
0:22:22,477 --> 0:22:25,597
He wouldn't give the name for Sal?


402
0:22:25,597 --> 0:22:30,237
What's the big deal? So I didn't give him
the number for Dr Tang?


403
0:22:30,237 --> 0:22:38,357
She's got leukaemia. Sticking a few
needles in her face is not gonna fix that.


404
0:22:38,357 --> 0:22:41,797
OK. I think it's time for you boys


405
0:22:41,797 --> 0:22:50,877
to fuck off now. Hmm?


406
0:22:50,877 --> 0:22:55,37
Well, really, really nice to catch up, Soph.
See you tomorrow?


407
0:22:55,37 --> 0:22:57,437
- Tomorrow. Great.
- 'Yeah, that's the way.


408
0:22:57,437 --> 0:22:59,357
'Sophie's the one.


409
0:22:59,357 --> 0:23:2,917
'Toni is Russia -
vast, mysterious, unconquerable.


410
0:23:2,917 --> 0:23:8,437
'Sophie is Poland - manageable,
won't put up too much of a fight.


411
0:23:8,437 --> 0:23:11,37
'Shit. Oh, shit. '


412
0:23:11,37 --> 0:23:14,877
- It's paedo!
- 'OK, you want some, do you?


413
0:23:14,877 --> 0:23:26,837
'Do you want a taste of my steel? '


414
0:23:26,837 --> 0:23:30,357
# And did those feet in ancient times


415
0:23:30,357 --> 0:23:34,957
# Feel it!
# Walk upon England's pastures green


416
0:23:34,957 --> 0:23:37,357
# Rah!
# Outrageous


417
0:23:37,357 --> 0:23:39,397
# Ah, yeah!


418
0:23:39,397 --> 0:23:41,637
# Uh! Uh! Eeh! Oh!


419
0:23:41,637 --> 0:23:45,997
# Ohhh!


420
0:23:45,997 --> 0:25:45,997
# God save our gracious que... #
