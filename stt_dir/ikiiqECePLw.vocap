###9 -Going a little higher today than in practice.
###13 Yeah.
###16 Oh, [INAUDIBLE].
###18 DANNY KASS: If you go to the US Open and you've been
###21 practicing a run for three months, and you've landed it
###23 for two months straight.
###25 Well then, you know what?
###25 You're running it good enough.
###27 Because it's got to be something that you come up
###29 with that's just there.
###31 You got to feed off the crowd of the energy to really do it.
###34 And I did it.
###34 I did my first ever frontside 1080, after a
###37 cab 1080 in the 2002.
###41 And it was a time where I think a lot of people thought
###43 that the sport really wasn't going to
###44 progress much further.
###45 And when they saw this young kid from Jersey just kind of
###49 pushing and pushing, I think a lot of people really realized
###52 that it was time to shit or get off the pot.
###58 -This is Danny Kass [INAUDIBLE].
###59 
###63 Cab 1080.
###66 Yeah!
###68 JAKE BURTON: I think Danny Kass, he just epitomizes what
###73 the Open's about, which is amplitude,
###76 technical tricks, and style.
###78 TOM MONTEROSSO: Take any pro snowboarder that's alive
###80 today, any big name pro snowboarder.
###82 Chances are at some point they either went to the US Open or
###86 competed in the US Open.
###88 I remember in the early 2000s when Danny Kass went on his
###92 crazy winning streak.
###93 Once he won the US Open, which is one of the last contests of
###96 the year, that's when it was like, holy shit, Danny Kass is
###99 hands down the best pipe rider in the world.
###100 The whole thing was a huge, huge win for anybody.
###103 ROSS POWERS: I always looked at it like, I want to just go,
###106 put on the best show I can, have the best
###107 time, and go for it.
###109 And nowadays in snowboarding there's so many events that it
###112 gets all the top riders together, kind of end of the
###115 year battle.
###116 Everyone's been working hard through the year.
###117 What tricks do you got?
###118 Throw them down.
###120 
###126 TODD KOHLMAN: Just with the US Open being like the longest
###128 running event in snowboarding, and keeping it an open where
###134 people can sign up and then work their way up to ride
###137 against the big riders kind of has a soulful feel to
###141 snowboarding.
###142 Just back to the roots.
###143 
###148 BARRY DUGAN: They were pros.
###149 You kind of knew who was going to show up and contend.
###151 But there was always that mystery about what teenager or
###158 tween was going to show up and throw down.
###161 JASON FORD: Not only has it been an iconic competition for
###164 Vermont and the East Coast, and all the people that drive
###167 four or five hours to attend it.
###169 But it's been good for snowboarding, because having a
###172 US Open title, or win, or even a podium has been, for many
###177 people, a highlight in their career.
###179 TOM MONTEROSSO: You didn't really have a lot of events on
###181 the East Coast that you could go to.
###182 It was the US Open every March where you could see
###186 [INAUDIBLE].
###187 Jamie Lynn would make an appearance.
###189 Mike Michaelchuk, Jim Rippey, Daniel Frank, all these icons.
###194 KELLY CLARK: The people who drive up from Jersey all night
###197 and sleep in their car to come watch the US Open, it's almost
###203 got like-- what do you want to call?
###204 Like a cultish following.
###206 PAT BRIDGES: Just like kind of like a meeting of the tribe.
###209 And you had all these college kids, and ex-ski racers, and
###214 sort of like burnouts, drop outs, kind of people who
###217 wanted to be a part of a fringe group.
###219 SETH NEARY: I remember being at the gondola and seeing Noah
###223 Salasnek and Chris Roach, and just being completely
###226 starstruck.
###226 I mean, like holy shit, these dudes are here.
###229 One hand you're kind of like fanning out.
###230 But at the other side, you're like competing.
###232 You want to compete against them and win.
###235 
###247 ANDY COHGLAN: Back then it was just a straight shot downhill.
###251 I had Vans high top checkered shoes on.
###254 Man, was it scary.
###256 You're just on this old--
###258 this stuff.
###258 It just made it so much harder.
###260 JAKE BURTON: It was sort of a daredevil type scene.
###264 Probably the appropriate word.
###266 And table upside down for the starting gate.
###268 And it was wild because in the
###271 beginning, it was like downhills.
###272 I don't know, it's sort of where we were at, just
###274 charging down the hill.
###275 DONNA CARPENTER: If you were willing, you were welcome.
###277 
###279 I do remember the first woman rider.
###282 And she cried at the top for like 20 minutes until we
###287 talked her into going.
###289 So it was very intimidating.
###290 I mean, it was these alpine courses.
###292 They were icy.
###292 We didn't have great equipment.
###294 ANDY COGHLAN: The US Open was really important for Jake, and
###297 he took it over from Paul Graves who ran the first one
###301 in Woodstock, Vermont, in '82 and wasn't
###304 going to do it again.
###305 And so Jake, kind of out of necessity, was trying to find
###309 a way to expose snowboarding to the world.
###314 JAKE BURTON: The freestyle thing hadn't really happened.
###316 And a lot of people look back and say, why not?
###319 But it was a necessary time for snowboarding.
###321 We had to develop boards, riders had
###324 to develop the technique.
###325 And we had to develop product that you could get down the
###327 hill on, and turn right, and left, and stop, and do all
###330 those sort of necessary functions.
###333 ANDY COGHLAN: It was great.
###333 I mean, especially when Burton started making the halfpipe, I
###337 think the whole sport really progressed.
###340 And the media really started to cover it.
###342 TERRY KIDWELL: It was 1988, they had
###344 their first half pipe.
###346 And I was like surprised.
###348 We get out there and they have this huge
###349 backhoe digging the pipe.
###352 That's the first time I've ever seen a piece of equipment
###354 digging the walls for us, probably the
###356 best pipe to date.
###357 I mean, it had to have been.
###358 Jake always put a lot of effort into having that event
###362 be the event of the year.
###364 JAKE BURTON: We had Craig Kelly riding for us at the
###366 time, and he was a phenomenal pipe rider.
###369 I can remember that first year, Terry Kidwell won it.
###371 And he and Craig would just go at it.
###375 And it was an incredible competition.
###378 It was super fun to see.
###380 ANDY COGHLAN: It was also a kind of the
###381 changing of the guard.
###383 Because that was the year that all the young guns were
###385 supposed to win.
###386 Terry Kidwell won the halfpipe and I won the downhill.
###389 So the two old guys ended up winning for one more year,
###393 until the young guys came the next year and took over.
###397 MIKE HAYES: As soon as they introduced the halfpipe,
###400 that's when we started to see the crowds show up.
###402 Basically, the whole event started to gravitate towards
###406 the freestyle events just because that was the real
###408 crowd pleaser.
###409 It's a lot more fun to watch the halfpipe than it is to
###412 watch some slalom races.
###414 And so eventually they phased out the alpine events, and
###417 that's pretty much when I retired.
###419 They retired me.
###421 PAT BRIDGES: I mean, it used to be like an underground
###424 where you'd hear the Stratton pipe got cut,
###426 and you'd go there.
###427 And then, part of the mythology of the Open was the
###429 fact that not only was it open to competing, but once that
###433 last competitor dropped in for the finals,
###436 that pipe was open.
###437 And it was mayhem.
###438 
###447 CHRIS COPLEY: As an announcer, it was really tough.
###448 Because we would have to say, all right, hold the course.
###453 They're cutting to a commercial right now.
###455 And so everyone's standing around going, what--
###457 come on, man.
###459 It broke up the whole flow of the event.
###461 And then, like a couple dudes were like, hey, I don't care.
###465 I'm just bombing it.
###466 And they would just cut under the fence and charge it.
###469 And the crowd would go so berserk.
###470 
###478 HANNAH TETER: People loved to see the [INAUDIBLE]
###479 in between.
###479 It just adds the fun element to it and the non-seriousness
###483 effect kind of goes away, which is nice.
###485 JAKE BURTON: Not that anybody's encouraging
###487 anybody to do it.
###488 I mean, you've got to have a certain amount of balls.
###491 Abe Teter, I think, probably gets the best career poacher.
###495 I mean, that guy just always went huge.
###497 And people loved to see him ride, so nobody ever
###500 complained about it.
###503 BARRY DUGAN: It was to see who was going to be king and
###505 queen, that's for damn sure.
###506 But it was to have a lot of fun doing it.
###508 And be within touching distance and getting the high
###511 fives from the crowd, and being able to hear that roar
###514 and walk through the crowd and be at the same parties with
###517 the athletes.
###518 I think that's the legacy of the Open, is being
###521 the best of the best.
###522 TERRY KIDWELL: There are a lot of big events around the world
###524 from the past to the present, but I think US Open has stood
###529 the test of time.
###530 I'm super stoked to hear they're going
###534 into their 30th year.
###535 That is super cool.
###536
