###0 democrats are the only people who were matter rent paul for his filibuster of
###3 some republics were mad uh... and you know we're all right side when the
###7 republican and democratic establishment or opposed to us so the wall street
###11 journal of course
###13 there to a scientist
###14 tremendously conservative or they clearly think it's a really their
###17 corporate us they love uh... all the multinational corporations and protect
###21 them and the establishment so in this case alike
###24 extra u_s_ citizens of plus a pro stylish banquet allotted i'll get your
###28 empl
###29 uh... here's a wall street journal quote
###32 gear rental credit for theatrical timing
###36 as a snowstorm to settle on a washington
###38 the filibuster fill their attention void on twitter and cable t_v_
###43 it's always reasoning match the showmanship
###46 people
###48 of the area is supposed to go
###50 uh... all right so what is your best of your argument i'm curious
###54 well here's what they see
###55 calm down center
###57 how awesome we do mean is that
###59 uh... mister holder is right
###61 even if he doesn't explain the low very well u_s_ government cannot randomly
###65 target america citizens on u_s_ soil or anywhere else
###68 what it can do under the laws of war is target than enemy combatant
###73 anywhere anytime
###75 including on u_s_ soil
###77 this includes and u_s_ citizen who is also
###81 an enemy combatant and all of that
###84 his that's the wall street journal being smug and say
###86 up all quote
###90 yourselves so i read for a number is there is other sister
###93 and would you rate and there are even though i
###95 well when i killing u_s_ citizens work ily enemy combatants who are u_s_
###99 citizens
###100 but wait a minute you schwantz that's the whole point
###103 who gets to the side of their an enemy combatant
###106 okay so if i'm the president
###108 and i decided you are an enemy combatant kenai execute you
###113 unlike not everyday probably wouldn't
###116 probably
###119 we don't do that in this country or we weren't we didn't use to do that in this
###123 country they give the executive branch that authority to just the claire people
###126 guilty
###128 you know that so they should do that so we are the magna carta the kings would
###130 say autograph power wrong
###135 intended for robert
###137 and then
###138 he would be executed without a trial without anything
###141 hitting a citizen
###142 meetings as i declared it a bit outlawing your dog
###145 in a wall street journal on these republican knuckle heads want to go back
###148 to that time and by the way so the democratic not collapse
###151 so they when when paul says
###154 undermines all western civilization he's absolutely right for the wall street
###158 journal snickers with sharply execute them
###163 well of course and i want her comes walmart or john mccain
###167 hooters ones this stuff he says
###170 i watch some of that quote debate on quote yesterday i don't think that same
###174 quoting but
###175 bailey says i saw carcinoma better
###178 teleflora voice some of this
###180 uh... some concern
###181 we just totally unfounded really john white
###184 but let's say that the user jane fonda's name
###186 does a book certain memories with me and i must say that she is not my favorite
###189 american
###190 as reported mission
###192 uh... could we kill her during the vietnam war
###195 uh... but i also believe that as audiences it was miss pond acted within
###198 our constitutional rights
###200 and is somehow say the someone who disagrees with american policy and even
###204 demonstrates against it
###205 is somehow member of an organization which makes that individual an enemy
###208 combatant assembly false someone falls
###211 well how do you know john
###213 you've never seen any of the evidence
###215 so we killed on or all of locking sixteen-year-old son
###218 how do you know he was there any combat
###221 in fact we ask the united states government why did you kill 'em they say
###224 we're not gonna say about but when it was not purpose or was it an accident
###228 when i can say anything about
###230 so you can execute sixty or u_s_ citizens
###234 and not tell us
###235 what u_s_ senate executed them
###237 on what evidence let alone on what legal principle
###241 and what do you want it or not
###243 but don't worry distrust the wall street journal and john mccain
###246 effing second because i want to get out more
###249 then they can
###250 we executed without any due process
###254 so he wrote some republicans the so-called conservatives
###258 including the one thing
###259 angry with obon administration on this
###263 extreme
###264 on her door unconstitutional executive power over your services
###270 of course who's going to rework them here comes the canes laptop
###274 lindsey graham william lindsay
###276 to my republican colleagues are in memory of you coming down here
###280 suggesting that president bush was gonna kill anybody with a draft
###286 are only remember the harshest critics of the
###288 uh... for our president bush on the democratic side they had a drone program
###292 back then
###293 so what is it
###294 all of a sudden
###296 that this trial program
###298 has gotten every republican so spina
###302 whether we ought to hear
###304 people are astonished that president obama center mccain is doing many of the
###309 things that president bush did
###312 i'm not a scottish i congratulated
###315 or having the good judgment understand where war
###320 though i agree with the first part you know the bombs are being hypocrites
###323 because they didn't someone from doing any of this
###326 but then the second was like
###327 this is the one thing lizzie grams below will probably have some bad briefly
###332 right
###333 he's also ya bums the woodwork forthrightly l mama until one or more
###336 than one there were resolved on please vote for me
###339 but on this what all he has great judgment
###342 lindsey graham
###343 was that attorney in the military
###346 that was his job an attorney
###348 and here is turns around and says
###350 well president says he's a man he come back
###354 well then obviously edits
###357 no it's not his
###358 that's why we have trials
###360 that's why it's a democracy but lindsey graham john mccain and wrestle war
###364 mongers
###365 i've totally forgotten that
###367 thank god that ran paul stood up to them
###370 and the republican establishment and the democratic establishment
###373 they've all fergan
###374 but the constitution sposed to be about
###378 and they're also smart mode
###380 they're not gonna give these guys and i deleted poets
###384 that you and i might get put on a list of some point somebody without power
###388 might get put on a list they've gotta go on a list right
###391 but you'd given executive or anybody
###394 unlimited power
###397 tick tock
###398 ticked off
###399 only a matter of time
###400 before they start abusing that power
###402 there are any sort of museum abroad
###404 there is a wall street journal article ironically given their editorial says
###409 here
###409 where they explain
###411 and the c_i_a_ and then a little caterpillar the drone program
###415 and uh... they realize ever while they were just using
###418 subleasing interest rates
###420 they had no idea who they were killing and risk ratings so much blow back from
###423 the local populations that they decide to go radon test aloo you know a bit
###429 you know what this continued until people that they don't know have
###433 but not quite as much as before
###434 but exactly power would never corrupt right
###439 if they're asking for a list one day all watch them
###443 goal
###444 how
###445 but you know was intrigued
###447 that they can i mean the president
###450 can put anybody honest killers
###452 as long as he calls an enemy combatant there is no check on him
###458 you've got a big damn sure you're not an enemy combatant
