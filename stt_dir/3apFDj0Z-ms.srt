[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]

0:0:21,242 --> 0:0:23,94
TREVOR GRAVES: In Portland I own
Nemo Design with a couple


3
0:0:23,94 --> 0:0:26,7
other guys and we have a 20,000
square foot building.


4
0:0:26,7 --> 0:0:28,85
And Dave Seoane rents
the basement.


5
0:0:28,85 --> 0:0:30,44
So he's part of our folklore.


6
0:0:30,44 --> 0:0:32,89
And when people come through
the shop and do the factory


7
0:0:32,89 --> 0:0:35,375
tour and they're like, "yeah,
there's this weird guy that


8
0:0:35,375 --> 0:0:36,18
lives in the basement."


9
0:0:36,18 --> 0:0:38,46
The editors come in.


10
0:0:38,46 --> 0:0:39,69
"Hey, we're going to do
a story about Nemo.


11
0:0:39,69 --> 0:0:40,76
And Dave steals the show.


12
0:0:40,76 --> 0:0:42,18
It's always about Dave.


13
0:0:42,18 --> 0:0:43,1
So that's cool.


14
0:0:43,1 --> 0:0:44,41
We like it that way.


15
0:0:44,41 --> 0:0:48,31
DAVE SEOANE: Well I guess
I could-- the truth is--


16
0:0:48,31 --> 0:0:51,96
can I say anything about
the fire marshals, or--


17
0:0:51,96 --> 0:0:55,39
because technically this space,
which I don't live


18
0:0:55,39 --> 0:0:57,83
here, because you're not
supposed to live here.


19
0:0:57,83 --> 0:1:0,78
But I do get tired and I do
have to take naps here.


20
0:1:0,78 --> 0:1:4,37
So the couch is not a
good place to really


21
0:1:4,37 --> 0:1:5,3
concentrate and focus.


22
0:1:5,3 --> 0:1:8,542
So this is why I built the
Mobile Sleeping Device that


23
0:1:8,542 --> 0:1:14,23
you can wheel around anywhere
in the house.


24
0:1:14,23 --> 0:1:20,11
It has a complete surround
sound, bed, the bare basics.


25
0:1:20,11 --> 0:1:21,65
I have this.


26
0:1:21,65 --> 0:1:24,3
This is my tactic in case
anybody breaks in.


27
0:1:24,3 --> 0:1:25,13
What are you going to do?


28
0:1:25,13 --> 0:1:26,552
Are you going to shoot them?


29
0:1:26,552 --> 0:1:27,29
I don't have a gun.


30
0:1:27,29 --> 0:1:33,56
So you take this and you
just go [SIREN SOUND]


31
0:1:33,56 --> 0:1:35,23
That would scare the shit out
of you, right, if you walked


32
0:1:35,23 --> 0:1:37,58
into a dark warehouse trying
to rob something.


33
0:1:37,58 --> 0:1:40,46
You'd run.


34
0:1:40,46 --> 0:1:42,43
I don't know.


35
0:1:42,43 --> 0:1:43,68
That's my theory.


36
0:1:43,68 --> 0:1:46,43



37
0:1:46,43 --> 0:1:49,344
But the best room is this
one right here.


38
0:1:49,344 --> 0:1:51,212
This is the room the fire
marshal [INAUDIBLE].


39
0:1:51,212 --> 0:1:55,81



40
0:1:55,81 --> 0:1:57,965
Every room should have
a soundproof room.


41
0:1:57,965 --> 0:1:59,45
-Every house?


42
0:1:59,45 --> 0:2:0,7
DAVE SEOANE: Every house,
every warehouse.


43
0:2:0,7 --> 0:2:3,21



44
0:2:3,21 --> 0:2:7,52
This belongs to a friend of
mine, Jason Brown who is a--


45
0:2:7,52 --> 0:2:9,46
as you can see, his set up--


46
0:2:9,46 --> 0:2:12,66
he's very experimental.


47
0:2:12,66 --> 0:2:14,99
It's got two layers
of drywall.


48
0:2:14,99 --> 0:2:18,36
It's kind a six-inch air pocket
that's insulated.


49
0:2:18,36 --> 0:2:21,25
And it's got another two by
four wall with another two


50
0:2:21,25 --> 0:2:22,72
layers of sheet rock all
the way around it.


51
0:2:22,72 --> 0:2:23,9
So it's completely--


52
0:2:23,9 --> 0:2:24,99
it's pretty soundproof.


53
0:2:24,99 --> 0:2:26,59
You can't-- you can hear,
like, the lows.


54
0:2:26,59 --> 0:2:27,8
You can hear the kick drum.


55
0:2:27,8 --> 0:2:29,79
But you can't hear any of the
highs at all and everything


56
0:2:29,79 --> 0:2:30,76
else is muted out.


57
0:2:30,76 --> 0:2:31,17
-That's awesome.


58
0:2:31,17 --> 0:2:32,42
DAVE SEOANE: So it works
out really well.


59
0:2:32,42 --> 0:2:38,68



60
0:2:38,68 --> 0:2:40,502
I have this but I have
no affiliation to it.


61
0:2:40,502 --> 0:2:43,295



62
0:2:43,295 --> 0:2:46,8
Squaw Valley art
sale for $0.98.


63
0:2:46,8 --> 0:2:49,31
I remember as a little kid,
seeing this as a skate shop,


64
0:2:49,31 --> 0:2:51,71
like, wow, you just put those on
your skateboard and you can


65
0:2:51,71 --> 0:2:55,238
go down the snow?


66
0:2:55,238 --> 0:2:57,9
That's incredible.


67
0:2:57,9 --> 0:2:58,44
It was like, this old stuff.


68
0:2:58,44 --> 0:2:59,39
But I didn't learn on this.


69
0:2:59,39 --> 0:3:0,41
I learned on a Burton
Backhill.


70
0:3:0,41 --> 0:3:6,73
But I do definitely share
my respect for Shuman.


71
0:3:6,73 --> 0:3:10,23
He's a good man.


72
0:3:10,23 --> 0:3:14,65
MIKE BASICH: Dave Seoane, met
him '86, Donner Ski Ranch,


73
0:3:14,65 --> 0:3:16,64
first contest ever entered.


74
0:3:16,64 --> 0:3:20,29
I actually met Chris Roach that
day too, and Monty Roach,


75
0:3:20,29 --> 0:3:22,85
Tucker Francis.


76
0:3:22,85 --> 0:3:24,83
Seoane's someone I've
always kind of


77
0:3:24,83 --> 0:3:26,28
related to pretty well.


78
0:3:26,28 --> 0:3:30,66
We've always been curious
about creating stuff.


79
0:3:30,66 --> 0:3:36,53
And Dave was a bit of a
scavenger in the younger age.


80
0:3:36,53 --> 0:3:38,54
He's always the guy who
slept on someone's


81
0:3:38,54 --> 0:3:41,39
deck out on the curb.


82
0:3:41,39 --> 0:3:44,81
He was always someone that came
in with a surprise and


83
0:3:44,81 --> 0:3:46,6
something new.


84
0:3:46,6 --> 0:3:48,21



85
0:3:48,21 --> 0:3:50,19
DAVE SEOANE: I have the original
Squaw Valley Gas


86
0:3:50,19 --> 0:3:53,3
Station sign that I'm going to
sell to somebody that lives in


87
0:3:53,3 --> 0:3:59,11
Squaw Valley, for $60,000.


88
0:3:59,11 --> 0:4:1,102
Exhibit A, this is the--


89
0:4:1,102 --> 0:4:5,15



90
0:4:5,15 --> 0:4:7,97
Can I interest you in an SR?


91
0:4:7,97 --> 0:4:10,59
A K100?


92
0:4:10,59 --> 0:4:11,84
Scrap yard.


93
0:4:11,84 --> 0:4:13,95



94
0:4:13,95 --> 0:4:15,86
-Which one you shoot, though?


95
0:4:15,86 --> 0:4:18,11
DAVE SEOANE: I shot,
probably, this ASR.


96
0:4:18,11 --> 0:4:21,67
This is probably the one
that I use the most.


97
0:4:21,67 --> 0:4:24,66
This was the work horse.


98
0:4:24,66 --> 0:4:26,9
That thing's been all
over the world.


99
0:4:26,9 --> 0:4:27,32
What's that?


100
0:4:27,32 --> 0:4:28,81
-Is that my lens?


101
0:4:28,81 --> 0:4:30,45
DAVE SEOANE: No


102
0:4:30,45 --> 0:4:32,64
TREVOR GRAVES: My relationship
with Dave has been like the


103
0:4:32,64 --> 0:4:35,26
high school buddy you're
friends with forever.


104
0:4:35,26 --> 0:4:37,51
Like I say, he goes, he figures
out to weld, figures


105
0:4:37,51 --> 0:4:40,405
out how to cut movies, how to
film, how to snowboard.


106
0:4:40,405 --> 0:4:42,39
He just kind of has that--


107
0:4:42,39 --> 0:4:44,89
he always wants to
keep learning.


108
0:4:44,89 --> 0:4:47,84
I think that's why I like
hanging out with him and I


109
0:4:47,84 --> 0:4:48,458
respect being around him.


110
0:4:48,458 --> 0:4:50,69
He, he gets it done, you know?


111
0:4:50,69 --> 0:4:51,84
He's got the best program.


112
0:4:51,84 --> 0:4:54,68
Dave's on the best program,
I'm telling you.


113
0:4:54,68 --> 0:4:57,51
DAVE SEOANE: This, see this
right here though?


114
0:4:57,51 --> 0:4:58,715
This is my future home.


115
0:4:58,715 --> 0:5:0,87
This is what I'm working
towards right here.


116
0:5:0,87 --> 0:5:2,77
-This is the proper
mobile home?


117
0:5:2,77 --> 0:5:3,85
DAVE SEOANE: This is the
proper mobile home.


118
0:5:3,85 --> 0:5:7,0
This will be a legal
mobile home.


119
0:5:7,0 --> 0:5:9,39
It's a 1949 Silver
Streak Clipper.


120
0:5:9,39 --> 0:5:13,75
It's going to be put back
to original form.


121
0:5:13,75 --> 0:5:15,79
-Are you going to chrome
it and everything?


122
0:5:15,79 --> 0:5:18,83
DAVE SEOANE: Well you can see
I polished an area here.


123
0:5:18,83 --> 0:5:23,19
So it is possible to get
some sheen out of it.


124
0:5:23,19 --> 0:5:24,835
Oh, this is an English wheel.


125
0:5:24,835 --> 0:5:29,69
This is for pretty much bending
aluminum and rolling.


126
0:5:29,69 --> 0:5:32,22
It's what they made cars, and
that's what they made


127
0:5:32,22 --> 0:5:33,6
airplanes out of back
in the day.


128
0:5:33,6 --> 0:5:35,34
Probably they're still
with us today, a lot


129
0:5:35,34 --> 0:5:36,76
of prototype parts.


130
0:5:36,76 --> 0:5:41,8
But it has been taken into the
motorcycle industry, and it's


131
0:5:41,8 --> 0:5:43,86
been popularized.


132
0:5:43,86 --> 0:5:48,34
This is the wood room here,
which is building a lot of


133
0:5:48,34 --> 0:5:50,29
table tops and furniture
and prototypes.


134
0:5:50,29 --> 0:5:52,22
So it's good to come up with
ideas and concepts.


135
0:5:52,22 --> 0:5:54,53
And then you can come in here
and build it out of wood.


136
0:5:54,53 --> 0:5:56,55
And then I do a lot of welding
as well out there.


137
0:5:56,55 --> 0:5:59,687
So I can put pieces together
and build it up and fab up


138
0:5:59,687 --> 0:6:1,6
whatever comes to mind.


139
0:6:1,6 --> 0:6:2,39
So it's nice.


140
0:6:2,39 --> 0:6:5,65
It's a complete luxury to have
all this at my fingertips.


141
0:6:5,65 --> 0:6:7,63



142
0:6:7,63 --> 0:6:9,98
MIKE BASICH: Seoane and Jamie
Lynn were probably the two


143
0:6:9,98 --> 0:6:12,85
snowboarders that started
marketing


144
0:6:12,85 --> 0:6:15,13
their image as artists.


145
0:6:15,13 --> 0:6:19,45
And Jamie was the painter and
Seoane was the welder.


146
0:6:19,45 --> 0:6:21,71
And it's good stuff.


147
0:6:21,71 --> 0:6:24,58
He makes good stuff.


148
0:6:24,58 --> 0:6:26,19
It's stuff within reason.


149
0:6:26,19 --> 0:6:28,866
It's not non-purpose art.


150
0:6:28,866 --> 0:6:29,97
He made a chair.


151
0:6:29,97 --> 0:6:31,22
He needed to sit
down somewhere.


152
0:6:31,22 --> 0:6:33,7



153
0:6:33,7 --> 0:6:38,21
DAVE SEOANE: I moved to
Tahoe in probably '87.


154
0:6:38,21 --> 0:6:40,93
In Tahoe area, I mean there was,
like Terry Kidwell and


155
0:6:40,93 --> 0:6:42,91
Shaun Palmer, and
Keith Kimmel.


156
0:6:42,91 --> 0:6:45,55
Like, those guys were-- and
Jim Zellers and Tom Burt.


157
0:6:45,55 --> 0:6:47,19
Those guys were all kind
of established.


158
0:6:47,19 --> 0:6:49,77
And it was like, Chris
Roach and Palmer.


159
0:6:49,77 --> 0:6:52,8
Those guys were the ones
that started getting


160
0:6:52,8 --> 0:6:53,7
sponsored by Sims.


161
0:6:53,7 --> 0:6:56,21
And they were the first
real, like, force of--


162
0:6:56,21 --> 0:6:57,46
the start of getting product.


163
0:6:57,46 --> 0:6:59,79



164
0:6:59,79 --> 0:7:3,45
This is like right after the
second or third World Cup.


165
0:7:3,45 --> 0:7:8,5
But I think it was probably
in '88 or '89 that the Cal


166
0:7:8,5 --> 0:7:12,63
Series, they had an event that
went all around California,


167
0:7:12,63 --> 0:7:14,44
amateur and pro snowboard
contest.


168
0:7:14,44 --> 0:7:17,67
And that's where Chris Roach
and Tucker and everybody


169
0:7:17,67 --> 0:7:19,7
would, we would all
tour around that.


170
0:7:19,7 --> 0:7:20,465
And so there's that kind
of first generation.


171
0:7:20,465 --> 0:7:24,1
And I feel like I'm kind of
the second generation with


172
0:7:24,1 --> 0:7:26,13
Chris Roach and Tucker
Francis.


173
0:7:26,13 --> 0:7:28,59
Steve Graham and Damian Sanders
came up to Tahoe a


174
0:7:28,59 --> 0:7:29,5
little bit later.


175
0:7:29,5 --> 0:7:34,26
So they're kind of like third
wave, I should say.


176
0:7:34,26 --> 0:7:36,47
I didn't know Steve
before Look.


177
0:7:36,47 --> 0:7:39,5
So we hooked up and met through
Look Snowboards


178
0:7:39,5 --> 0:7:40,19
through Burt Lamar.


179
0:7:40,19 --> 0:7:41,88
STEVE GRAHAM: That was pretty
much my partner in crime for


180
0:7:41,88 --> 0:7:45,14
traveling with and living with,
because we were both on


181
0:7:45,14 --> 0:7:48,3
Look and filming together too.


182
0:7:48,3 --> 0:7:51,83
We just had so much fun back
then, probably because our


183
0:7:51,83 --> 0:7:53,3
equipment sucked so bad.


184
0:7:53,3 --> 0:7:54,26
We rode for Look.


185
0:7:54,26 --> 0:7:58,96
And there was no real design
there for years.


186
0:7:58,96 --> 0:8:0,78
We were both screwed.


187
0:8:0,78 --> 0:8:3,29
But we would make
the most of it.


188
0:8:3,29 --> 0:8:4,99
DAMIAN SANDERS: Dave's
a great guy.


189
0:8:4,99 --> 0:8:5,84
We actually lived together.


190
0:8:5,84 --> 0:8:8,42
So yeah, when Steve Graham and
Dave and I all started riding


191
0:8:8,42 --> 0:8:11,46
together, we got this place in
Donner, three or four bedroom.


192
0:8:11,46 --> 0:8:12,3
And they moved in with me.


193
0:8:12,3 --> 0:8:13,45
And it was just a blast.


194
0:8:13,45 --> 0:8:16,18
So three pro snowboarders living
together, and my wife


195
0:8:16,18 --> 0:8:17,25
Brandi at the time.


196
0:8:17,25 --> 0:8:19,72
And we'd wake up, go to
squaw, meet the rat


197
0:8:19,72 --> 0:8:20,8
pack, ride all day.


198
0:8:20,8 --> 0:8:21,8
And then back to our house.


199
0:8:21,8 --> 0:8:23,39
And then we kind of lived
in a mountainous area.


200
0:8:23,39 --> 0:8:25,69
So we were always just up on
the hill, building jumps,


201
0:8:25,69 --> 0:8:26,93
building rail slides.


202
0:8:26,93 --> 0:8:28,984
It was just nonstop snowboarding
from the time we


203
0:8:28,984 --> 0:8:31,7
woke up to the time
we went to sleep.


204
0:8:31,7 --> 0:8:32,559
DAVE SEOANE: Right at that
time is when snowboarding


205
0:8:32,559 --> 0:8:35,58
started to get more
recognized.


206
0:8:35,58 --> 0:8:38,48
And there was a French guy at
one of the trade shows.


207
0:8:38,48 --> 0:8:40,799
We'd go there and these French
guys were in suits.


208
0:8:40,799 --> 0:8:42,64
And we're like, oh shit,
this is serious stuff.


209
0:8:42,64 --> 0:8:44,53
These guys are in suits.


210
0:8:44,53 --> 0:8:45,96
These guys are all biz.


211
0:8:45,96 --> 0:8:48,72
And the guy who was running
Look, his name was Jacques


212
0:8:48,72 --> 0:8:51,3
Gris, this French gentleman.


213
0:8:51,3 --> 0:8:53,85
And we went out that night and
had the funnest time ever.


214
0:8:53,85 --> 0:8:55,9
He was like the loosest
guy I've ever met.


215
0:8:55,9 --> 0:8:56,78
He was hilarious.


216
0:8:56,78 --> 0:8:58,89
And after that, it was
like, OK, no problem.


217
0:8:58,89 --> 0:9:1,77
I can easily work
with these guys.


218
0:9:1,77 --> 0:9:3,84
Waking up, going to work,
and complaining


219
0:9:3,84 --> 0:9:5,62
about work all day.


220
0:9:5,62 --> 0:9:7,68
If you're complaining
about it so much,


221
0:9:7,68 --> 0:9:9,41
then why are you there?


222
0:9:9,41 --> 0:9:12,4
And you should just be out doing
what you want to do, no


223
0:9:12,4 --> 0:9:13,895
matter what you're doing, as
long as you're having a good


224
0:9:13,895 --> 0:9:15,6
time, that's all that counts.


225
0:9:15,6 --> 0:9:18,43
MIKE BASICH: He's the one guy
that really never competed.


226
0:9:18,43 --> 0:9:21,42
He made a pretty new career.


227
0:9:21,42 --> 0:9:24,91
Because back then, everyone
competed to be sponsored.


228
0:9:24,91 --> 0:9:28,19
And Seoane, he went straight
into filming, pretty much.


229
0:9:28,19 --> 0:9:29,13
He did a few contests.


230
0:9:29,13 --> 0:9:34,7
But he got sponsored for being
in Fall Line Films.


231
0:9:34,7 --> 0:9:35,68
TREVOR GRAVES: Usually where
he works is "Snowboarder


232
0:9:35,68 --> 0:9:38,16
Magazine," which sponsors
Snowboarders in Exile.


233
0:9:38,16 --> 0:9:41,91
My job was to go and cover it
and make stills and write a


234
0:9:41,91 --> 0:9:44,83
story about whatever it was
that we were doing.


235
0:9:44,83 --> 0:9:49,85
And so I'd sleep on Jerry's
couch countless nights.


236
0:9:49,85 --> 0:9:51,13
And that's where I met Dave.


237
0:9:51,13 --> 0:9:52,355
So Seoane--


238
0:9:52,355 --> 0:9:54,51
it's funny, I lose track
of it, actually.


239
0:9:54,51 --> 0:9:56,825
I've been on some of my best
road trips with Seoane.


240
0:9:56,825 --> 0:10:0,16
Juneau, Alaska, we've been to
New Zealand, so I'm stoked


241
0:10:0,16 --> 0:10:3,55
that we've still got a
good relationship.


242
0:10:3,55 --> 0:10:7,4
DAVE SEOANE: Yeah, we did
actually go to the contest.


243
0:10:7,4 --> 0:10:9,3
But it was never, we never had
any pressure that we had to do


244
0:10:9,3 --> 0:10:10,8
good in the contest.


245
0:10:10,8 --> 0:10:14,2
It was more like a great way to
see your buddies and have


246
0:10:14,2 --> 0:10:17,43
few hundred cases of beer
and have a good time.


247
0:10:17,43 --> 0:10:17,94
Yes?


248
0:10:17,94 --> 0:10:21,49
-What's the most important
thing to you right now?


249
0:10:21,49 --> 0:10:24,65
DAVE SEOANE: Trying to find
a '59 dying station wagon.


250
0:10:24,65 --> 0:10:25,642
-And food.


251
0:10:25,642 --> 0:10:27,515
DAVE SEOANE: I'm not
worried about food.


252
0:10:27,515 --> 0:10:29,61
Once I get the wagon I'll be
able to drive anywhere in the


253
0:10:29,61 --> 0:10:31,502
world and eat.


254
0:10:31,502 --> 0:10:32,921
I just need to get there.


255
0:10:32,921 --> 0:10:34,63
MIKE BASICH: Yeah, Seoane's,
like I said,


256
0:10:34,63 --> 0:10:35,71
he's a bit of a scavenger.


257
0:10:35,71 --> 0:10:38,73
I mean, I've been in Japan with
him and seen him pull out


258
0:10:38,73 --> 0:10:43,74
an ice cream upside down in an
ashtray and eat it for $10.


259
0:10:43,74 --> 0:10:46,43
Not because he wanted to, but
mostly because he was in Japan


260
0:10:46,43 --> 0:10:50,32
and didn't have $10.


261
0:10:50,32 --> 0:10:52,24
DAVE SEOANE: The old
ice cream story.


262
0:10:52,24 --> 0:10:54,51
Well what happened was we--


263
0:10:54,51 --> 0:10:56,52
Steve Graham and I were Japan.


264
0:10:56,52 --> 0:10:59,12
I think I had probably
$23 to my name.


265
0:10:59,12 --> 0:11:1,76
I think Steve had, maybe-- he
probably had, like $100.


266
0:11:1,76 --> 0:11:5,89
And I just walked by the table
and they were making


267
0:11:5,89 --> 0:11:6,74
all these big bets.


268
0:11:6,74 --> 0:11:9,9
And, like, who would need this
ice cream cone with cigarette


269
0:11:9,9 --> 0:11:10,68
butts and hair and gum on it.


270
0:11:10,68 --> 0:11:12,15
STEVE GRAHAM: It was Brushie,
Jeff Brushie was


271
0:11:12,15 --> 0:11:13,4
eating this ice cream.


272
0:11:13,4 --> 0:11:15,45
We were all sitting around this
table and it has this


273
0:11:15,45 --> 0:11:18,1
huge Japanese ashtray in there
which just nothing but


274
0:11:18,1 --> 0:11:21,47
cigarette butts and gum and
just all this crap.


275
0:11:21,47 --> 0:11:24,49
And for some reason, Brushie
grabs the ice cream--


276
0:11:24,49 --> 0:11:25,3
yeah, Dave.


277
0:11:25,3 --> 0:11:26,79
Remember this one?


278
0:11:26,79 --> 0:11:31,36
We got the money up to
like $80 or $100.


279
0:11:31,36 --> 0:11:35,48
And we're going to get $20 from
Jacobi, even, and from


280
0:11:35,48 --> 0:11:38,11
him and getting $20 from
him was tight.


281
0:11:38,11 --> 0:11:39,86
Then Dave walks up
and goes, what?


282
0:11:39,86 --> 0:11:40,93
How much for that?


283
0:11:40,93 --> 0:11:44,58
Just grabs it and just, boom,
take a huge bite.


284
0:11:44,58 --> 0:11:47,56
He was pretty much supposed to
eat pretty much anything that


285
0:11:47,56 --> 0:11:48,53
was on that ice cream.


286
0:11:48,53 --> 0:11:52,44
Not the whole thing, but spit
out the cigarette butts.


287
0:11:52,44 --> 0:11:55,7
DAVE SEOANE: And I walked by
and they were like, yeah,


288
0:11:55,7 --> 0:11:56,91
we're not sure who's
going to do it.


289
0:11:56,91 --> 0:11:59,78
And so I was like, wait, $120
to eat that right now?


290
0:11:59,78 --> 0:12:0,49
And they're like, yeah.


291
0:12:0,49 --> 0:12:2,7
And I just grabbed the
thing and I ate it.


292
0:12:2,7 --> 0:12:4,4
And I spit out the cigarette
butts but I ate the


293
0:12:4,4 --> 0:12:4,56
cigarettes.


294
0:12:4,56 --> 0:12:7,88
There was probably like three or
four cigarettes that I ate.


295
0:12:7,88 --> 0:12:11,21
And that's probably the sickest
I've ever been in my


296
0:12:11,21 --> 0:12:13,28
life, for three days.


297
0:12:13,28 --> 0:12:14,45
I was completely dehydrated.


298
0:12:14,45 --> 0:12:17,4
I couldn't take on any
food or water.


299
0:12:17,4 --> 0:12:20,33
I shit the bed like
four times.


300
0:12:20,33 --> 0:12:21,8
Don't eat tobacco.


301
0:12:21,8 --> 0:12:23,44
It's the worst thing
for you ever.


302
0:12:23,44 --> 0:12:27,3
It was the hardest $120 I've
ever made in my life.


303
0:12:27,3 --> 0:12:28,48
STEVE GRAHAM: He was
sick for four days.


304
0:12:28,48 --> 0:12:29,73
But he got his--


305
0:12:29,73 --> 0:12:34,66



306
0:12:34,66 --> 0:12:37,97
he got his electronic item
he wanted the $80 for.


307
0:12:37,97 --> 0:12:40,84
He was sick the whole
damn trip.


308
0:12:40,84 --> 0:12:43,11
DAVE SEOANE: No, with that money
I bought beer out of the


309
0:12:43,11 --> 0:12:44,261
vending machine.


310
0:12:44,261 --> 0:12:48,12



311
0:12:48,12 --> 0:12:50,9
MIKE BASICH: Sometimes after
that he got so curious about


312
0:12:50,9 --> 0:12:53,26
the filming part, he
got involved on the


313
0:12:53,26 --> 0:12:54,76
other side the camera.


314
0:12:54,76 --> 0:12:57,63
That's what he does now.


315
0:12:57,63 --> 0:12:59,9
JERRY DUGAN: I taught Seoane
how to shoot film.


316
0:12:59,9 --> 0:13:2,28
Then he went off to make his
own films after a while.


317
0:13:2,28 --> 0:13:3,64
DAVE SEOANE: I think I came
into the picture doing a


318
0:13:3,64 --> 0:13:5,84
little bit on Critical
Condition, doing


319
0:13:5,84 --> 0:13:7,24
the helmet cam stuff.


320
0:13:7,24 --> 0:13:10,38
The only reason why the helmet
cam came into play is because


321
0:13:10,38 --> 0:13:11,83
the Blizzard of Ozz.


322
0:13:11,83 --> 0:13:13,4
Like, those guys were
skiing with it.


323
0:13:13,4 --> 0:13:16,93
And the only reason I got
chose to wear the helmet


324
0:13:16,93 --> 0:13:18,185
camera is because I was the
closest to the ground and I


325
0:13:18,185 --> 0:13:20,24
had the fattest neck to
support the thing.


326
0:13:20,24 --> 0:13:23,44
Because the thing probably
weighed like--


327
0:13:23,44 --> 0:13:25,31
I think it had to weigh
like 15, 20 pounds.


328
0:13:25,31 --> 0:13:28,73
It had a camera and then they
were putting on lead pieces to


329
0:13:28,73 --> 0:13:29,9
counterbalance.


330
0:13:29,9 --> 0:13:32,7
So it was a pretty cumbersome
contraption.


331
0:13:32,7 --> 0:13:34,93
Yeah, if you're short and have
a fat neck, you're going to


332
0:13:34,93 --> 0:13:38,45
have a helmet cam
thrown on you.


333
0:13:38,45 --> 0:13:41,89
The other reason I got thrown
onto a helmet cam is because I


334
0:13:41,89 --> 0:13:44,2
can keep up with the
other snowboarders.


335
0:13:44,2 --> 0:13:49,32
There was a trip to go to
Valle Nevado, Chile with


336
0:13:49,32 --> 0:13:50,26
Palmer and Roach.


337
0:13:50,26 --> 0:13:52,11
And I wanted to go
to snowboard.


338
0:13:52,11 --> 0:13:54,69
And there was no room to
go as a snowboarder.


339
0:13:54,69 --> 0:13:57,684
But Jerry had offered me a
chance if I wanted to go to


340
0:13:57,684 --> 0:14:0,45
shoot second camera angle,
or third camera angle.


341
0:14:0,45 --> 0:14:2,81
And it wasn't even
a hesitation.


342
0:14:2,81 --> 0:14:4,685
I just got a camera.


343
0:14:4,685 --> 0:14:7,5
And we did a little film
test and it worked out.


344
0:14:7,5 --> 0:14:10,36
And I'd always had an interest
in still photography.


345
0:14:10,36 --> 0:14:14,52
So I can adapt to the
film playing.


346
0:14:14,52 --> 0:14:16,52
CIRCE WALLACE: Seoane
is such an art fag.


347
0:14:16,52 --> 0:14:18,33
I don't even think he
knew what an art fag


348
0:14:18,33 --> 0:14:19,24
he was early on.


349
0:14:19,24 --> 0:14:22,41
I think now he would totally
embrace that title.


350
0:14:22,41 --> 0:14:24,57
So I think he got--


351
0:14:24,57 --> 0:14:27,14
I think he saw a great
opportunity for him to get


352
0:14:27,14 --> 0:14:28,41
involved on a creative level.


353
0:14:28,41 --> 0:14:31,33
And I think Jerry and
Artie needed it.


354
0:14:31,33 --> 0:14:33,8
He had a really fun idea.


355
0:14:33,8 --> 0:14:35,3
Let's go on a road trip.


356
0:14:35,3 --> 0:14:37,34
DAVE SEOANE: That's when I
talked Jerry and Artie into


357
0:14:37,34 --> 0:14:40,18
letting me do a couple little
side projects with them.


358
0:14:40,18 --> 0:14:45,14
And that's when I came up the
concept and directed Roadkill


359
0:14:45,14 --> 0:14:47,59
and 8-Tracks and RPM,
those three films.


360
0:14:47,59 --> 0:14:51,37
Which we try to do same season
releases, so we'd go out the


361
0:14:51,37 --> 0:14:53,8
first, like November, December,
January, and try to


362
0:14:53,8 --> 0:14:55,28
release it in February.


363
0:14:55,28 --> 0:14:56,8
And we did that for three
years in a row.


364
0:14:56,8 --> 0:14:58,76
I mean snowboarding was like,
the progression of it was


365
0:14:58,76 --> 0:15:0,26
going pretty quick.


366
0:15:0,26 --> 0:15:3,24
When we first did Roadkill, at
the end of-- what was that?


367
0:15:3,24 --> 0:15:5,32
I think, like, Riders on the
Storm-- at the end of that,


368
0:15:5,32 --> 0:15:8,75
everybody started buttering
tricks and nose presses and


369
0:15:8,75 --> 0:15:10,37
all that funky stuff.


370
0:15:10,37 --> 0:15:14,55
But this was a way to, instead
of waiting a whole other year


371
0:15:14,55 --> 0:15:16,46
to capture this and show this,
was to be like, OK.


372
0:15:16,46 --> 0:15:17,87
This is what's going on now.


373
0:15:17,87 --> 0:15:19,299
So here you go.


374
0:15:19,299 --> 0:15:35,28
[OUT-OF-TUNE GUITAR PLAYING]


375
0:15:35,28 --> 0:15:38,13
JASON BORGSTEDE: Oh yeah,
Roadkill and RPM, those--


376
0:15:38,13 --> 0:15:39,93
I think Roadkill was
the first one.


377
0:15:39,93 --> 0:15:42,77
And that was our hard
core movie.


378
0:15:42,77 --> 0:15:46,12
That was our first half-hour
movie, just


379
0:15:46,12 --> 0:15:47,14
quick, quick, quick.


380
0:15:47,14 --> 0:15:50,27
But they put together a super
sick lineup right when


381
0:15:50,27 --> 0:15:54,3
freestyle was really busting
out, when this gear here right


382
0:15:54,3 --> 0:15:56,39
here was the stuff to be.


383
0:15:56,39 --> 0:15:58,9
Blind Jeans, what's up?


384
0:15:58,9 --> 0:16:2,16
And Brushie right here
was killing it.


385
0:16:2,16 --> 0:16:7,27
And that's why, it must have
been 15 years later, I'm on


386
0:16:7,27 --> 0:16:11,5
the internet looking to buy a
Brushie board, because of


387
0:16:11,5 --> 0:16:12,65
those videos in those days.


388
0:16:12,65 --> 0:16:15,99
Reminded of the time when we
were first getting into it and


389
0:16:15,99 --> 0:16:18,16
first really pushing to
try to get better


390
0:16:18,16 --> 0:16:22,24
and emulate our idols.


391
0:16:22,24 --> 0:16:26,24
DAVE SEOANE: Roadkill was with
Terje Haakonsen and John


392
0:16:26,24 --> 0:16:33,95
Cardiel was in it, Bryan Iguchi,
Graham, Palmer, Jamie


393
0:16:33,95 --> 0:16:38,43
Lynn was in it, Circie was in
it, a couple others that I


394
0:16:38,43 --> 0:16:39,92
can't think off the
top my head.


395
0:16:39,92 --> 0:16:41,7
But that was--


396
0:16:41,7 --> 0:16:44,97
we started off in Tahoe.


397
0:16:44,97 --> 0:16:45,84
We took a limousine.


398
0:16:45,84 --> 0:16:48,82
And then Palmer came with us
with his limousine, because he


399
0:16:48,82 --> 0:16:51,5
has a whole garage full of
limousines for some reason.


400
0:16:51,5 --> 0:16:53,85
That was like, in a matter of
like a month and a half.


401
0:16:53,85 --> 0:16:57,46
And that was a brutal
month and a half.


402
0:16:57,46 --> 0:16:59,3
And Bud Fawcett was--


403
0:16:59,3 --> 0:17:1,51
we were driving down
in Colorado.


404
0:17:1,51 --> 0:17:2,74
We were on one of the
main interstates.


405
0:17:2,74 --> 0:17:5,96
And it was 11 o'clock at night
and one of the belts


406
0:17:5,96 --> 0:17:7,4
blew off the car.


407
0:17:7,4 --> 0:17:9,23
And Bud was driving.


408
0:17:9,23 --> 0:17:9,99
So luckily Bud--


409
0:17:9,99 --> 0:17:12,4
I don't know how he did it--
but got us there safely.


410
0:17:12,4 --> 0:17:13,48
We found a gas station.


411
0:17:13,48 --> 0:17:14,56
And I'm trying to--


412
0:17:14,56 --> 0:17:15,48
they're just getting
ready to close.


413
0:17:15,48 --> 0:17:17,359
But I found a replacement
belt.


414
0:17:17,359 --> 0:17:19,13
And in the car, and
I'm trying to--


415
0:17:19,13 --> 0:17:19,97
I mean, it's cold.


416
0:17:19,97 --> 0:17:22,23
It's like 11 o'clock in the
middle Colorado at night.


417
0:17:22,23 --> 0:17:23,13
And then I'm--


418
0:17:23,13 --> 0:17:24,39
those guys are all
just hanging out,


419
0:17:24,39 --> 0:17:25,4
partying in the limousine.


420
0:17:25,4 --> 0:17:27,46
And I'm out there getting
my hands dirty and


421
0:17:27,46 --> 0:17:28,349
trying to fix this belt.


422
0:17:28,349 --> 0:17:30,37
And I open the door try
to get something.


423
0:17:30,37 --> 0:17:33,75
And the Gooch, I remember, Bryan
Iguchi, he was like,


424
0:17:33,75 --> 0:17:35,47
Dave, can you shut the door?


425
0:17:35,47 --> 0:17:36,46
It's cold out there.


426
0:17:36,46 --> 0:17:37,94
And I was like, you
fucking asshole.


427
0:17:37,94 --> 0:17:40,835
And I just totally snapped at
him and yelled at him so hard.


428
0:17:40,835 --> 0:17:42,2
I was so pissed.


429
0:17:42,2 --> 0:17:43,74
And then after they all
came out of the


430
0:17:43,74 --> 0:17:44,975
car, and were quiet.


431
0:17:44,975 --> 0:17:46,47
And they were like,
we're sorry.


432
0:17:46,47 --> 0:17:48,82
Do you need a hand
with anything?


433
0:17:48,82 --> 0:17:51,3
And I was like, thanks
you guys.


434
0:17:51,3 --> 0:17:54,64
So that was one of just many
little highlights.


435
0:17:54,64 --> 0:17:59,5
CIRCE WALLACE: I really remember
Jamie and Palmer


436
0:17:59,5 --> 0:18:1,95
jumping the Donner cliffs, that


437
0:18:1,95 --> 0:18:3,74
little section in Roadkill.


438
0:18:3,74 --> 0:18:6,62
I remember watching Palmer
backside 360 that Donner


439
0:18:6,62 --> 0:18:9,85
cliff, thinking like that maybe
was one of the gnarliest


440
0:18:9,85 --> 0:18:11,26
things I've ever seen.


441
0:18:11,26 --> 0:18:12,51
And he had that clown hairdo.


442
0:18:12,51 --> 0:18:16,17



443
0:18:16,17 --> 0:18:18,61
DAVE SEOANE: Yeah, it was Jamie
Lynn and Circe actually


444
0:18:18,61 --> 0:18:21,515
came down from Washington to
do a segment in Tahoe.


445
0:18:21,515 --> 0:18:25,67
That's when we went out into
the back country in Donner


446
0:18:25,67 --> 0:18:27,93
Summit and just built a jump.


447
0:18:27,93 --> 0:18:30,966
He was just one of the guys that
I wanted to work with.


448
0:18:30,966 --> 0:18:32,73
And I think Jerry already
had enough


449
0:18:32,73 --> 0:18:34,34
credibility where people--


450
0:18:34,34 --> 0:18:35,89
they were approached
by people--


451
0:18:35,89 --> 0:18:37,71
that people wanted to
work with them.


452
0:18:37,71 --> 0:18:40,45
So it was kind of nice that
they had established


453
0:18:40,45 --> 0:18:40,93
themselves.


454
0:18:40,93 --> 0:18:43,1
And people were coming to them
and we were already kind of


455
0:18:43,1 --> 0:18:45,44
grandfathered in there.


456
0:18:45,44 --> 0:18:49,71
JAMIE LYNN: I just remember
hiking up Donner Pass, and


457
0:18:49,71 --> 0:18:54,2
Sugar Bowl, and the
Donner Ski Ranch.


458
0:18:54,2 --> 0:18:56,7
And the days we rode
after that were the


459
0:18:56,7 --> 0:18:57,42
days that were filmed--


460
0:18:57,42 --> 0:19:1,62
that we got to film all the
shots for Roadkill.


461
0:19:1,62 --> 0:19:5,1
Because it had just snowed,
like, 10 feet.


462
0:19:5,1 --> 0:19:7,29
And then Tahoe is so
concentrated with different


463
0:19:7,29 --> 0:19:10,2
areas, you can just go from one
area to the next and just


464
0:19:10,2 --> 0:19:11,1
pick, like--


465
0:19:11,1 --> 0:19:17,82
and with those guys's kind of
pass to access that stuff, it


466
0:19:17,82 --> 0:19:20,75
allowed us to get up into some
really, really good snow.


467
0:19:20,75 --> 0:19:24,0
Like early up, some KT-22
at Squaw Valley.


468
0:19:24,0 --> 0:19:25,41
No one does that.


469
0:19:25,41 --> 0:19:28,36
DAVE SEOANE: While I was making
those films, Roadkill


470
0:19:28,36 --> 0:19:30,52
and 8-Tracks and RPM, I was
still working with Rossignol


471
0:19:30,52 --> 0:19:31,9
at the time.


472
0:19:31,9 --> 0:19:33,49
So I was just going
to work in film.


473
0:19:33,49 --> 0:19:36,61
And then Rossignol offered me a
position to design and build


474
0:19:36,61 --> 0:19:39,1
boards and still keep doing
what I was doing.


475
0:19:39,1 --> 0:19:40,55
So I couldn't say no to it.


476
0:19:40,55 --> 0:19:42,68
So I was working with Rossignol,
helping them design


477
0:19:42,68 --> 0:19:46,56
boards and helping to promote
Rossignol, and like a little


478
0:19:46,56 --> 0:19:48,2
bit of film segments.


479
0:19:48,2 --> 0:19:49,5
But it was kind of dying off.


480
0:19:49,5 --> 0:19:52,12
And that's when I just got into
more of the filmmaking


481
0:19:52,12 --> 0:19:53,27
aspect of it.


482
0:19:53,27 --> 0:19:56,2
And the reason why I got in the
film aspect of it was just


483
0:19:56,2 --> 0:19:58,31
because I had a really
good relationship


484
0:19:58,31 --> 0:20:0,41
with most of the riders.


485
0:20:0,41 --> 0:20:3,13
So it was pretty seamless.


486
0:20:3,13 --> 0:20:6,24
MIKE BASICH: I think he jumped
ship just a year or two early


487
0:20:6,24 --> 0:20:7,89
from the pro snowboarder
to filming.


488
0:20:7,89 --> 0:20:9,49
But I think he was so interested
in the filming


489
0:20:9,49 --> 0:20:13,45
part, he just dove into
that pretty quick.


490
0:20:13,45 --> 0:20:14,7
It's been good for the sport.


491
0:20:14,7 --> 0:20:18,21
I mean, he's brought the athlete
side of the eye more


492
0:20:18,21 --> 0:20:21,67
on the other side of the camera
to capture the sport a


493
0:20:21,67 --> 0:20:25,3
little better from the rider's
point of view.


494
0:20:25,3 --> 0:20:28,35
I think Fall Line was working
with him for so long he


495
0:20:28,35 --> 0:20:30,62
learned a lot from them.


496
0:20:30,62 --> 0:20:33,386
DAVE SEOANE: Let's get these
girls to start working here.


497
0:20:33,386 --> 0:20:35,3
It's getting late here.


498
0:20:35,3 --> 0:20:36,91
JEFF CURTES: I always knew of
him from the videos, like


499
0:20:36,91 --> 0:20:39,1
watching Snowboarders in Exile,
and watching him fly


500
0:20:39,1 --> 0:20:43,87
off huge cliffs in Jackson Hole,
but definitely part of


501
0:20:43,87 --> 0:20:45,76
different circles of people.


502
0:20:45,76 --> 0:20:48,51
He wasn't part of the Burton
world in his pro snowboarding


503
0:20:48,51 --> 0:20:49,56
scene at all.


504
0:20:49,56 --> 0:20:53,82
So he was part of a Tahoe
kind of scene.


505
0:20:53,82 --> 0:20:59,79
So the paths really didn't
cross for me until he got


506
0:20:59,79 --> 0:21:1,6
behind the camera.


507
0:21:1,6 --> 0:21:5,15
Burton hired him to kind
of come on a shoot.


508
0:21:5,15 --> 0:21:6,72
We became friends there.


509
0:21:6,72 --> 0:21:9,24
He's got a really cool way about
him, a really quirky


510
0:21:9,24 --> 0:21:12,5
style, and really different than
the way I shoot photos.


511
0:21:12,5 --> 0:21:14,19
So I just watched
him do his deal.


512
0:21:14,19 --> 0:21:17,26
And I'm like, wow, I can learn
a lot from his approach and


513
0:21:17,26 --> 0:21:19,86
how he interacts with the
riders and things.


514
0:21:19,86 --> 0:21:23,51
Full immersion, like
just, party scene?


515
0:21:23,51 --> 0:21:24,6
He's in there.


516
0:21:24,6 --> 0:21:25,69
Or a shred scene?


517
0:21:25,69 --> 0:21:26,43
He's in there.


518
0:21:26,43 --> 0:21:30,9
Like, he's such a sick rider.


519
0:21:30,9 --> 0:21:32,3
And he has evolved quite
a bit as well.


520
0:21:32,3 --> 0:21:35,9
He was just super loose and part
of the scene and would


521
0:21:35,9 --> 0:21:36,96
just capture it better
than anyone else.


522
0:21:36,96 --> 0:21:39,2
He made Haakonsen movies,
Subjekt Haakonsen.


523
0:21:39,2 --> 0:21:42,22
And he's just shredding, and
probably just right in there


524
0:21:42,22 --> 0:21:45,5
with Terje, living the
lifestyle, and just getting it


525
0:21:45,5 --> 0:21:46,19
all on film.


526
0:21:46,19 --> 0:21:48,55
So nothing that you
can really learn.


527
0:21:48,55 --> 0:21:52,48
I think you just have to be that
person, be part of it.


528
0:21:52,48 --> 0:21:54,94
Be a good friend first and then
get the relationships on


529
0:21:54,94 --> 0:21:56,84
the camera.


530
0:21:56,84 --> 0:21:58,75
SHAUN WHITE: I'm not sure
exactly how we met.


531
0:21:58,75 --> 0:22:0,29
I know it was a long,
long time ago.


532
0:22:0,29 --> 0:22:3,85
We were probably either
around Mount Hood or


533
0:22:3,85 --> 0:22:4,84
something like that.


534
0:22:4,84 --> 0:22:7,69
But all I remember was watching
Subjekt Haakonsen and


535
0:22:7,69 --> 0:22:10,88
just thought that was
the best movie ever.


536
0:22:10,88 --> 0:22:11,68
I love the riding.


537
0:22:11,68 --> 0:22:14,42
I love the way it was put
together and the music.


538
0:22:14,42 --> 0:22:18,19
And it had a vibe to it
and I liked that.


539
0:22:18,19 --> 0:22:20,6
DAVE SEOANE: That
came through--


540
0:22:20,6 --> 0:22:23,6
I'd been friends with Richard
Woolcott and been friends with


541
0:22:23,6 --> 0:22:24,98
Terje at this time.


542
0:22:24,98 --> 0:22:28,46
So we had kind of like thrown
the idea around to do it.


543
0:22:28,46 --> 0:22:31,43
So Richard Woolcott, Terje, and
I, we just sat down and


544
0:22:31,43 --> 0:22:32,87
talked about it to see how
it would work out.


545
0:22:32,87 --> 0:22:34,34
And we were like, yeah, it
totally makes sense.


546
0:22:34,34 --> 0:22:36,39
And Terje was totally into it.


547
0:22:36,39 --> 0:22:39,98
Volcom put up the dough for
it and produced it.


548
0:22:39,98 --> 0:22:42,58
It was good because this was
kind of before Terje would be


549
0:22:42,58 --> 0:22:47,29
so like, closed off to
everybody, when he was still


550
0:22:47,29 --> 0:22:50,61
kind of user friendly
for the public.


551
0:22:50,61 --> 0:22:53,51
But he was into it, so we
definitely had to take


552
0:22:53,51 --> 0:22:54,6
advantage of that.


553
0:22:54,6 --> 0:22:56,68
And that was a lot of fun too.


554
0:22:56,68 --> 0:22:58,91
That was a lot of traveling.


555
0:22:58,91 --> 0:23:1,98
Terje is, like, he's funny
because once you get out there


556
0:23:1,98 --> 0:23:6,38
and turn the camera on, you
can't really stop him.


557
0:23:6,38 --> 0:23:9,49
ANDREAS WIIG: So I had his main
movie that was called


558
0:23:9,49 --> 0:23:10,43
Subjekt Haakonsen.


559
0:23:10,43 --> 0:23:14,86
I've probably seen it, I don't
know, like 2,000 times.


560
0:23:14,86 --> 0:23:19,49
I can't watch it anymore because
it's a VHS and it's


561
0:23:19,49 --> 0:23:21,78
just too old now.


562
0:23:21,78 --> 0:23:23,3
I liked a lot of parts.


563
0:23:23,3 --> 0:23:27,7
I remember I really liked the
part when him and Daniel Frank


564
0:23:27,7 --> 0:23:29,12
are riding the half pipe--


565
0:23:29,12 --> 0:23:30,93
I think it was at Mount Hood--


566
0:23:30,93 --> 0:23:32,66
and had a part together.


567
0:23:32,66 --> 0:23:35,47
That's one of my
favorite parts.


568
0:23:35,47 --> 0:23:38,72
Other than that, there's this
part where it's hailing.


569
0:23:38,72 --> 0:23:40,81
He's doing this huge
back flip.


570
0:23:40,81 --> 0:23:44,53
The whole movie just has
so much variety.


571
0:23:44,53 --> 0:23:47,27
It's way more work to film
a whole movie than


572
0:23:47,27 --> 0:23:48,93
just to film a part.


573
0:23:48,93 --> 0:23:51,19
You have to be a pretty
complete rider to


574
0:23:51,19 --> 0:23:52,44
be able to do that.


575
0:23:52,44 --> 0:23:54,91



576
0:23:54,91 --> 0:23:58,11
At the time when his movie came
out, it was for sure the


577
0:23:58,11 --> 0:24:5,16
best movie ever made as far as
snowboarding, trick-wise and


578
0:24:5,16 --> 0:24:7,65
how technical he was riding.


579
0:24:7,65 --> 0:24:10,61
Not just like technical as far
as doing tricks, but just the


580
0:24:10,61 --> 0:24:13,0
way he was riding the terrain.


581
0:24:13,0 --> 0:24:14,91
DAVE SEOANE: Yeah, and not
just through the movie, I


582
0:24:14,91 --> 0:24:18,33
think, just his in general
popularity.


583
0:24:18,33 --> 0:24:21,81
It seemed like he's more of an
icon and in the US and Japan


584
0:24:21,81 --> 0:24:23,59
than he was in Europe.


585
0:24:23,59 --> 0:24:25,23
I don't know if that's
because he spent so


586
0:24:25,23 --> 0:24:27,72
much time over here.


587
0:24:27,72 --> 0:24:30,23
Because even in Norway--
it's different now.


588
0:24:30,23 --> 0:24:32,12
But back then in Norway, when
you'd walk around with him, he


589
0:24:32,12 --> 0:24:33,8
wasn't such a recognized guy.


590
0:24:33,8 --> 0:24:35,48
He was still, like, low key.


591
0:24:35,48 --> 0:24:37,52
We tried to get into
some club.


592
0:24:37,52 --> 0:24:42,0
And he had no pull to
get us in there.


593
0:24:42,0 --> 0:24:45,5
But here in the US, people
recognize him a lot more.


594
0:24:45,5 --> 0:24:45,64
But that's changed now.


595
0:24:45,64 --> 0:24:52,2
He's a big name in his
hometown, or in Oslo.


596
0:24:52,2 --> 0:24:53,51
What was after that?


597
0:24:53,51 --> 0:24:58,13
Then I did another film with
Terje, The Haakonsen Faktor.


598
0:24:58,13 --> 0:25:2,31
Terje's riding had developed
more into bigger free riding.


599
0:25:2,31 --> 0:25:6,9
So we were just trying
to capture that.


600
0:25:6,9 --> 0:25:7,73
But we got skunked
on so many trips.


601
0:25:7,73 --> 0:25:9,64
And then it was the end of the
season and we didn't really


602
0:25:9,64 --> 0:25:10,4
have much in the can.


603
0:25:10,4 --> 0:25:12,9
And we were like, OK, we've
got to go to New Zealand.


604
0:25:12,9 --> 0:25:14,67
So we'll go there for a couple
weeks and see what we can get.


605
0:25:14,67 --> 0:25:16,5
And then we were there
for six weeks.


606
0:25:16,5 --> 0:25:18,8
And there was times when--


607
0:25:18,8 --> 0:25:26,15
it was like, Iker Fernandez,
Michi Albin, the Gooch, Terje.


608
0:25:26,15 --> 0:25:28,13
Like, we were there for
the fourth week in.


609
0:25:28,13 --> 0:25:30,97
And they were like, it's
just not happening.


610
0:25:30,97 --> 0:25:32,44
We want to go home.


611
0:25:32,44 --> 0:25:33,13
And I was just like--


612
0:25:33,13 --> 0:25:34,52
I almost broke down in tears.


613
0:25:34,52 --> 0:25:35,97
I was like, you guys
can't leave.


614
0:25:35,97 --> 0:25:36,87
We're so close.


615
0:25:36,87 --> 0:25:38,93
We have a helicopter.


616
0:25:38,93 --> 0:25:40,2
I had to convince those
guys to stay.


617
0:25:40,2 --> 0:25:42,35
Because I mean, we were all
completely burnt down on being


618
0:25:42,35 --> 0:25:47,25
in one place, snowboarding
in the summertime.


619
0:25:47,25 --> 0:25:49,45
So they stuck it out.


620
0:25:49,45 --> 0:25:52,52
And we ended up--


621
0:25:52,52 --> 0:25:54,35
the weather finally cleared
and we got good shots.


622
0:25:54,35 --> 0:25:58,43
So it was worth putting in
the extra two weeks for.


623
0:25:58,43 --> 0:26:0,95
But it's hard traveling
and being in one


624
0:26:0,95 --> 0:26:3,4
spot for that long.


625
0:26:3,4 --> 0:26:12,59



626
0:26:12,59 --> 0:26:15,7
-Man, I thought you said no
one was going to be here.


627
0:26:15,7 --> 0:26:18,3
-It's that red-headed
snowboard kid.


628
0:26:18,3 --> 0:26:20,2
-Isn't there snow somewhere?


629
0:26:20,2 --> 0:26:21,99
-Yeah, there's some freshies
on the super


630
0:26:21,99 --> 0:26:23,82
jib in Tahoe, bro.


631
0:26:23,82 --> 0:26:24,14
-Come on.


632
0:26:24,14 --> 0:26:25,39
I got an idea.


633
0:26:25,39 --> 0:26:30,32



634
0:26:30,32 --> 0:26:30,47
-Hey.


635
0:26:30,47 --> 0:26:32,446
What's up, guys.


636
0:26:32,446 --> 0:26:33,598
-Tomato, how are you?


637
0:26:33,598 --> 0:26:35,75
-How you doing?


638
0:26:35,75 --> 0:26:38,98
SHAUN WHITE: I was about 16
and we paired up to do a


639
0:26:38,98 --> 0:26:40,54
movie, The White Album.


640
0:26:40,54 --> 0:26:42,4
And it was awesome.


641
0:26:42,4 --> 0:26:46,94
And it was just funny because
he's just this kind of like--


642
0:26:46,94 --> 0:26:48,95
I don't know how to describe
his personality.


643
0:26:48,95 --> 0:26:51,2
It's just one of a kind.


644
0:26:51,2 --> 0:26:53,47
It's awesome because we'd
be hanging out and


645
0:26:53,47 --> 0:26:54,6
shooting the movie.


646
0:26:54,6 --> 0:26:56,5
And I totally would forget
the fact that he just


647
0:26:56,5 --> 0:26:57,795
shreds on his own.


648
0:26:57,795 --> 0:27:0,5
And he's a really talented
snowboarder, especially back


649
0:27:0,5 --> 0:27:0,75
in the day.


650
0:27:0,75 --> 0:27:3,35
He had stories, but they were
mostly, like, oh this is when


651
0:27:3,35 --> 0:27:7,35
Farmer jumped out the window
at this hotel.


652
0:27:7,35 --> 0:27:8,46
Something like that, you
know what I mean.


653
0:27:8,46 --> 0:27:10,11
Just random, random
things like that.


654
0:27:10,11 --> 0:27:13,31
Because it was a wild
time back then.


655
0:27:13,31 --> 0:27:16,22
Because it was just a lot
different than now.


656
0:27:16,22 --> 0:27:19,78
So it was a humbling experience
to have him working


657
0:27:19,78 --> 0:27:22,46
on a project with me.


658
0:27:22,46 --> 0:27:24,32
DAVE SEOANE: I came up with the
idea of the Shaun White


659
0:27:24,32 --> 0:27:25,52
album probably--


660
0:27:25,52 --> 0:27:26,92
I wanted to do it the
year before--


661
0:27:26,92 --> 0:27:28,46
two years before it
was even released.


662
0:27:28,46 --> 0:27:31,64
And the reason for that is Shaun
White came on the Tony


663
0:27:31,64 --> 0:27:33,44
Hawk state park tours.


664
0:27:33,44 --> 0:27:35,98
And you could just see him, in
like a two week period of his


665
0:27:35,98 --> 0:27:37,57
progression was just
so much higher.


666
0:27:37,57 --> 0:27:40,22
And his snowboarding was
starting to pick up, and like,


667
0:27:40,22 --> 0:27:42,32
this is the year.


668
0:27:42,32 --> 0:27:43,54
Things are going to happen
for this kid.


669
0:27:43,54 --> 0:27:44,78
And it would be great
to document it.


670
0:27:44,78 --> 0:27:47,11
And I've known Shaun since he
was probably like eight years


671
0:27:47,11 --> 0:27:48,81
old, since he was
a little kid.


672
0:27:48,81 --> 0:27:51,4
And I've just watched him
grow up and develop.


673
0:27:51,4 --> 0:27:54,8
And his progression curve
was way bigger


674
0:27:54,8 --> 0:27:55,99
than anybody else's.


675
0:27:55,99 --> 0:27:58,23
So that year we were
going to do it.


676
0:27:58,23 --> 0:27:59,79
And then there was like,
he wasn't sure.


677
0:27:59,79 --> 0:28:0,84
And then his brother
wasn't sure.


678
0:28:0,84 --> 0:28:3,97
And then Renee from Burton
was like, no, Shaun's


679
0:28:3,97 --> 0:28:4,69
not ready for it.


680
0:28:4,69 --> 0:28:7,46
And Shaun won all these contests
all year round.


681
0:28:7,46 --> 0:28:9,23
And Renee and I just
butted heads.


682
0:28:9,23 --> 0:28:10,14
And I was so frustrated.


683
0:28:10,14 --> 0:28:13,4
But it gave us time to set
up for the next one.


684
0:28:13,4 --> 0:28:15,95
And so it gave us
more prep work.


685
0:28:15,95 --> 0:28:17,46
Then everybody was
completely in.


686
0:28:17,46 --> 0:28:19,42
And Renee and I are
now friends again.


687
0:28:19,42 --> 0:28:21,66
So it's nice.


688
0:28:21,66 --> 0:28:25,64
Oh, yeah, we used to totally get
into verbal feuds all the


689
0:28:25,64 --> 0:28:27,32
time on the phone.


690
0:28:27,32 --> 0:28:28,1
But it's funny now.


691
0:28:28,1 --> 0:28:30,82
We joke around about it.


692
0:28:30,82 --> 0:28:32,55
But Shaun was 17 at the time.


693
0:28:32,55 --> 0:28:35,56
And it just--


694
0:28:35,56 --> 0:28:38,61
that was a really tough film
because that one, he blew his


695
0:28:38,61 --> 0:28:39,77
knee out twice.


696
0:28:39,77 --> 0:28:45,21
And we thought for sure that
was another one, like, OK.


697
0:28:45,21 --> 0:28:46,99
And we're so far into this.


698
0:28:46,99 --> 0:28:49,19
And I had committed everything
to doing this.


699
0:28:49,19 --> 0:28:51,78
But we just had to wait and
see how his knee went.


700
0:28:51,78 --> 0:28:55,83
And we went down and we all sat
down with our negotiator,


701
0:28:55,83 --> 0:28:56,565
Richard Woolcott.


702
0:28:56,565 --> 0:28:58,28
And he said OK, this
is the deal.


703
0:28:58,28 --> 0:29:0,35
In two months, we shouldn't
throw the towel in yet.


704
0:29:0,35 --> 0:29:2,45
You should try and make
the call in a month


705
0:29:2,45 --> 0:29:3,77
and a half from now.


706
0:29:3,77 --> 0:29:6,665
And we just waited out and he
just snapped right back in.


707
0:29:6,665 --> 0:29:13,0
And we ended up, we went to New
Zealand for a month and it


708
0:29:13,0 --> 0:29:14,92
worked out fine.


709
0:29:14,92 --> 0:29:19,42
So it was John Gotgart, Sean
Aaron was on that New Zealand


710
0:29:19,42 --> 0:29:20,48
trip, and myself.


711
0:29:20,48 --> 0:29:22,33
So it was pretty much the
three of us shooting.


712
0:29:22,33 --> 0:29:27,54
But mostly G and I, and
a lot of G traveling.


713
0:29:27,54 --> 0:29:28,16
SHAUN WHITE: It was fun.


714
0:29:28,16 --> 0:29:30,81
It was really nice to be able
to work with someone who had


715
0:29:30,81 --> 0:29:31,89
their own vision.


716
0:29:31,89 --> 0:29:34,16
Because he knew how the movie
was going to play out way


717
0:29:34,16 --> 0:29:37,31
before I did, and way before
anyone else that was working


718
0:29:37,31 --> 0:29:39,44
on it with us really thought.


719
0:29:39,44 --> 0:29:42,91
So it was cool to see him
kind of, go OK, well we


720
0:29:42,91 --> 0:29:43,86
really need this shot.


721
0:29:43,86 --> 0:29:44,28
Or, you know what?


722
0:29:44,28 --> 0:29:45,22
This doesn't even matter.


723
0:29:45,22 --> 0:29:48,83
Because it was a really heavy
point my life because I had my


724
0:29:48,83 --> 0:29:51,12
first actual injury, I felt.


725
0:29:51,12 --> 0:29:52,58
I had to get surgery
on my knee.


726
0:29:52,58 --> 0:29:54,2
And we were going through
all this drama.


727
0:29:54,2 --> 0:29:56,5
And he just turned it
into such a cool


728
0:29:56,5 --> 0:29:57,9
thing for the movie.


729
0:29:57,9 --> 0:29:58,81
So I was surprised.


730
0:29:58,81 --> 0:30:0,208
Normally it's like,
oh, movie's over.


731
0:30:0,208 --> 0:30:0,7
Can't do anything.


732
0:30:0,7 --> 0:30:2,28
But he's like, no,
we can work it.


733
0:30:2,28 --> 0:30:5,27
We can figure it out.


734
0:30:5,27 --> 0:30:6,87
MIKE BASICH: His movies
he's done are usually


735
0:30:6,87 --> 0:30:9,4
pretty unique and--


736
0:30:9,4 --> 0:30:13,56
he's done the Haakonsen one,
and White's album.


737
0:30:13,56 --> 0:30:16,73
I think he's the one for
unique projects.


738
0:30:16,73 --> 0:30:19,84
I never see him going in the
business of making a movie


739
0:30:19,84 --> 0:30:20,32
every year.


740
0:30:20,32 --> 0:30:24,98
It's just something to really,
if it's right, right recipe


741
0:30:24,98 --> 0:30:27,89
for him, he dives into
that project.


742
0:30:27,89 --> 0:30:31,54
DAVE SEOANE: As far as future
films, if there's something


743
0:30:31,54 --> 0:30:36,21
that comes along that I'm
completely inspired, that I


744
0:30:36,21 --> 0:30:39,12
can see the beginning, middle,
and end to do on a--


745
0:30:39,12 --> 0:30:40,83
whether it's an athlete
or a film, then


746
0:30:40,83 --> 0:30:41,59
I'd like to do something.


747
0:30:41,59 --> 0:30:44,78
But I don't really-- there's
enough really good filmmakers.


748
0:30:44,78 --> 0:30:46,82
And there's really a shortage
of athletes who go out and


749
0:30:46,82 --> 0:30:50,21
just, like, turn a film out.


750
0:30:50,21 --> 0:30:52,79
But if something unique
really comes about, I


751
0:30:52,79 --> 0:30:53,48
definitely want to do it.


752
0:30:53,48 --> 0:30:55,13
And I think that's the
biggest thing.


753
0:30:55,13 --> 0:30:58,22
And everything is like, unless
you're passionate about it,


754
0:30:58,22 --> 0:30:59,4
it's just going to
be watered down.


755
0:30:59,4 --> 0:31:2,44
And I've had projects where
I wasn't really


756
0:31:2,44 --> 0:31:3,3
passionate about it.


757
0:31:3,3 --> 0:31:4,67
I felt like I just had to make
a film because I did one the


758
0:31:4,67 --> 0:31:5,24
year before.


759
0:31:5,24 --> 0:31:5,76
And I did it.


760
0:31:5,76 --> 0:31:6,95
And it was really
watered down.


761
0:31:6,95 --> 0:31:7,82
And it was just like, ugh.


762
0:31:7,82 --> 0:31:9,4
It just takes all the
fun out of it.


763
0:31:9,4 --> 0:31:11,3
But The White Album,
I was completely


764
0:31:11,3 --> 0:31:11,8
passionate about it.


765
0:31:11,8 --> 0:31:13,275
And it worked out really well.


766
0:31:13,275 --> 0:31:15,2
And I'm really proud
of that film.


767
0:31:15,2 --> 0:31:17,66
That's like the one film I love
showing people, like that


768
0:31:17,66 --> 0:31:19,94
and the movie with Terje.


769
0:31:19,94 --> 0:31:21,79
So those two films.


770
0:31:21,79 --> 0:33:21,79
