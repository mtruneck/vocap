###23 BEN LASHES: Brad O'Farrell kind of
###24 started this whole thing.
###25 BRAD O'FARRELL: Oh yeah, I guess.
###27 BEN LASHES: The internet, he started the internet.
###31 BRAD O'FARRELL: My name is Brad O'Farrell, and I posted
###33 the first Keyboard Cat video and started the meme of
###36 mashing up Keyboard Cat to fail videos so he's playing
###39 people off.
###40 
###47 So the actual video of the cat was filmed in 1985, I think.
###51 And I was born in 1986, so I didn't film the video.
###53 The original video was made by a guy named Charlie Schmidt.
###57 And he's an artist who does lots of different mediums.
###61 He's kind of like an old hippie.
###63 It sounds mean that I said that, but that's very much
###65 what he is.
###66 CHARLIE SCHMIDT: You're not getting anything done on this
###68 spray paint thing.
###68 Look at this mess.
###70 If you want to see weird, just be it.
###72 BRAD O'FARRELL: Completely unrelated to Keyboard Cat, he
###74 has a nose that he can move like an elephant.
###76 He can move it in directions, and he used to be in Japanese
###80 commercials and stuff.
###81 And he has an agent for his nose.
###84 And that was his job at some point.
###86 I can't remember exactly how I came across it.
###89 I was looking at a lot of videos at the time.
###92 Every day, my job was to look at videos.
###94 So somebody sent it to me, but I can't remember
###96 who sent it to me.
###97 The first video that I made was just a fail video of a guy
###103 trying to go up an escalator on a wheelchair, and then he
###106 tumbles backwards.
###106 And then Keyboard Cat plays him off.
###107 
###117 -You OK, man?
###118 -Yeah.
###119 BEN LASHES: So that's when all of a sudden this video that no
###122 one had cared about started exploding, going viral, and
###126 turning his life upside down a little bit.
###128 BRAD O'FARRELL: And I was originally going to do a
###128 series of them, so I sort of made it into a template of--
###132 I can easily repeat this template later, like a
###135 knock-knock joke type template.
###137 BEN LASHES: And why it was smart and why it
###138 caught on so well was--
###140 so much about the internet that's about shocking people
###143 as much as you can.
###144 BRAD O'FARRELL: Then I saw people starting unprompted
###147 doing parodies.
###147 I was like, whoa.
###149 BEN LASHES: A lot of these videos that it got put with,
###151 you almost don't know if it's right to laugh.
###155 It could be the most awful thing that you've ever seen,
###158 and if you put Keyboard Cat at the end of it,
###161 then you can smile.
###164 BRAD O'FARRELL: When it was happening, I was like, yeah.
###166 I was talking to people about that all the time.
###167 Because something I did was on MTV Movie Awards, and Bill
###171 O'Reilly said that Keyboard Cat was a patriot.
###173 I just wanted to talk about it, because it was an
###175 interesting thing that was going on in my life.
###177 BEN LASHES: About a year and a half into it, we'd already
###178 done a Wonderful Pistachios commercial.
###183 -Keyboard Cat does it purrrfectly.
###186 BEN LASHES: Movie trailer from "Exit Through the Gift Shop,"
###189 but he did it with all cats and he called it "Exit Through
###192 the Pet Shop." Still getting some cool deals coming across
###197 that was making Keyboard Cat a household name.
###200 BRAD O'FARRELL: Most of the stuff that's popular on
###201 YouTube isn't bloggers trying really hard to be popular.
###204 It's a baby biting another baby.
###207 -Charlie, that really hurt.
###210 
###213 Charlie bit me.
###214 BRAD O'FARRELL: You know, all these people that do things on
###216 the internet, there's two different categories.
###218 There's some people who ended up doing internet stuff, and
###223 they don't know how they got there, Like "David After the
###225 Dentist," where the little boy was at the dentist, and then
###228 he was on drugs.
###229 And he's in the car, and he's like, is this real life?
###232 -Stay in your seat.
###234 -[SCREAMING]
###240 I don't feel tired.
###243 -You don't?
###244 -Uh uh.
###245 BRAD O'FARRELL: You ever seen Tron Guy?
###246 He's this guy in a latex Tron costume, but he's really old
###251 and fat and has a pot belly.
###253 TRON GUY: I will never again be anonymous.
###255 And one of these days, somebody's going to come up
###257 with a way to synthesize 3D images from
###260 pictures on the internet.
###261 And 3D models of me are going to float around known space
###264 until there isn't any more.
###265 BRAD O'FARRELL: You know "Where the Hell is Matt," the
###266 guy who dances all over the world?
###268 
###273 His wife is somebody at Google.
###276 
###281 I've met him like eight times and never on purpose.
###285 I'll be traveling to a place, and he'll just happen to be
###287 also in that place, because we both go to
###288 internet videos things.
###290 People I've met on the internet and at internet
###293 conferences and stuff is like an alternate set of high
###295 school alumni friends, where you just follow where everyone
###298 is and you vaguely keep in touch.
###301 Do you guys know about meme characters at all?
###305 So Scumbag Steve is one of those.
###308 It's a photo of a guy in a really obnoxious hat.
###311 And he just looks like a douche.
###314 And people caption it stuff like, borrows your lighter and
###318 never gives it back.
###319 Your girlfriend's drunk, I'll take her home--
###321 stuff like that.
###322 He turned out to be a real person.
###323 BLAKE BOSTON: Yo, what's up?
###324 This is Blake Boston aka Scumbag Steve.
###326 [MUSIC PLAYING - BLAKE BOSTON, "SCUMBAG STEVE OVERTURE"]
###328 
###331 BLAKE BOSTON: Scumbag Steve is that guy you do not want
###333 around, all right?
###335 He'll steal your lighter, he'll steal your girlfriend,
###338 he'll steal anything that you have.
###339 You have him sleep over at your house,
###341 he's taking your mama.
###344 BRAD O'FARRELL: He's also not a scumbag at all, but he has
###347 the demeanor of a scumbag.
###348 He talks and makes jokes like he's a scumbag, but he's
###350 actually super nice.
###352 [MUSIC PLAYING - BLAKE BOSTON, "SCUMBAG STEVE OVERTURE"]
###353 
###365 BRAD O'FARRELL: I think I've run out of things really with
###367 Keyboard Cat.
###367 I'm sort of just sick of doing stuff related to Keyboard Cat.
###372 I don't care about it that much anymore, but it's
###374 interesting that it happened to me at some point.
