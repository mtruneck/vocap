1
0:1:51,756 --> 0:1:54,89
I'll try anything once, me,


2
0:1:54,89 --> 0:1:56,6
except bestiality.


3
0:1:56,6 --> 0:1:57,923
And maybe Morris dancing.


4
0:1:57,923 --> 0:1:59,84
Yeah, I'll try
and give them aswerve.


5
0:1:59,84 --> 0:2:3,215
Now round here where I live,
everyone's heard of Jason Locke.


6
0:2:3,215 --> 0:2:7,8
He'd just done a five stretch for armed
robbery. Been outless than 24 hours.


7
0:2:7,8 --> 0:2:9,633
Mr. D. had asked me
to drive him about for a few days,


8
0:2:9,633 --> 0:3:1,264
so I said, "Yeah, sure."


9
0:3:1,264 --> 0:3:3,14
We pick up this van, and Jason says...


10
0:3:3,14 --> 0:3:31,393
he wants to look up an old friend
who he knew from before.


11
0:3:31,393 --> 0:3:35,31
You squealin' git!
You fucker!


12
0:3:35,31 --> 0:3:38,269
You want some, huh?
Yeah, you cunt!


13
0:3:38,269 --> 0:3:42,103
Please, no more!


14
0:3:42,103 --> 0:3:48,103
Fucking grass!
Come here!


15
0:3:48,103 --> 0:3:56,48
Leave him alone!


16
0:3:56,48 --> 0:4:1,522
You fucking grass!


17
0:4:1,522 --> 0:4:4,939
This is what you get.


18
0:4:4,939 --> 0:4:9,273
Fuckin' grass!


19
0:4:9,273 --> 0:4:19,691
Get in there!


20
0:4:19,691 --> 0:4:22,691
Oh, my face!


21
0:4:22,691 --> 0:4:24,608
Shit.


22
0:4:24,608 --> 0:5:1,446
My face is burning up!


23
0:5:1,446 --> 0:5:3,446
Come on.
Let's go home.


24
0:5:3,446 --> 0:5:6,405
And that was that.Job done.


25
0:5:6,405 --> 0:5:24,491
Jason needed a new shirt.
The geezer needed a new face.


26
0:5:24,491 --> 0:5:28,283
Next, I take him to his mate's place,


27
0:5:28,283 --> 0:5:54,494
which he's been hearing
things about.


28
0:5:54,494 --> 0:6:12,538
Fucking bastards.


29
0:6:12,538 --> 0:6:16,747
Lisa?


30
0:6:16,747 --> 0:6:20,623
I've seen his house.
He's taking the piss.


31
0:6:20,623 --> 0:6:23,623
Nice, isn't it?


32
0:6:23,623 --> 0:6:25,623
Oh, yeah. How'd he get
that sort of dough?


33
0:6:25,623 --> 0:6:31,707
How'd he stay
out of prison?


34
0:6:31,707 --> 0:6:35,916
- You want egg with this?
- No. Yeah, go on.


35
0:6:35,916 --> 0:6:40,75
- Would you like anything?
- No, I'm all right. Ta.


36
0:6:40,75 --> 0:6:42,667
He had a Porsche
and a Bentley, the bastard.


37
0:6:42,667 --> 0:6:47,459
What, a Porsche now?
That must be new.


38
0:6:47,459 --> 0:6:50,46
- What about Wayne?
- Oh, he's got a five-series BMW...


39
0:6:50,46 --> 0:7:3,586
and a nice little three-bedroom house
in Billericay.


40
0:7:3,586 --> 0:7:7,45
It was a fucking mansion...
great big drive, electric gates,


41
0:7:7,45 --> 0:7:9,629
fucking statues of lions
on the gate posts.


42
0:7:9,629 --> 0:7:12,962
- You could have told me.
- What, spoil the surprise?


43
0:7:12,962 --> 0:7:15,588
Anyway, so look, I'm thinking,
"It's been a really interesting morning.


44
0:7:15,588 --> 0:7:17,963
Thanks very much.
If it's all the same to you..."


45
0:7:17,963 --> 0:7:20,172
- And then he says,
- Gonna need you some more, Billy.


46
0:7:20,172 --> 0:7:22,422
- All right? Later on.
- And I say...


47
0:7:22,422 --> 0:7:25,797
- Yeah, sure.
- And that's it. I've got the job.


48
0:7:25,797 --> 0:7:27,964
Your girlfriend won't mind,
will she, Billy?


49
0:7:27,964 --> 0:7:29,84
You have got a girlfriend,
haven'tyou?


50
0:7:29,84 --> 0:7:32,548
Yeah, I got a girlfriend.
She won't mind.


51
0:7:32,548 --> 0:7:46,8
Liar.


52
0:7:46,8 --> 0:7:48,842
One-nine. Yes, that's right.


53
0:7:48,842 --> 0:7:50,8
Mrs. Knight for Brentwood.


54
0:7:50,8 --> 0:7:54,384
Yeah, one-nine. Yeah, on my way.


55
0:7:54,384 --> 0:7:58,135
- The geezer grassed him up.
What else could he do?
- Oh, yeah?


56
0:7:58,135 --> 0:8:1,177
I ain't sayin' he should have gone
that far, but you know how it is.


57
0:8:1,177 --> 0:8:4,469
Oh, he just sounds
like an animal to me.


58
0:8:4,469 --> 0:8:7,719
They should put him back inside,
do us all a favor.


59
0:8:7,719 --> 0:8:9,97
He's just done a five-year stretch
'cause of this mug.


60
0:8:9,97 --> 0:8:12,47
- I'd have done exactly the same thing.
- That's you, is it, Billy?


61
0:8:12,47 --> 0:8:14,387
You could do that
to someone?


62
0:8:14,387 --> 0:8:20,54
In principle.


63
0:8:20,54 --> 0:8:38,98
Billy, don't get involved
with this bloke.


64
0:8:38,98 --> 0:8:41,473
See him, Peter, oh, he's the top boy.
He runs the show.


65
0:8:41,473 --> 0:8:44,474
Him, Wayne, does whatever
Peter tells him.


66
0:8:44,474 --> 0:8:50,35
And Jason... Well, every firm needs
a mad acidbath murderer, don't they?


67
0:8:50,35 --> 0:8:52,308
What do you think
of my hair, Billy?


68
0:8:52,308 --> 0:8:54,183
- You look like a fuckin' poof.
- Fuck off!


69
0:8:54,183 --> 0:8:56,642
What?


70
0:8:56,642 --> 0:9:0,643
Fuck of, will ya?


71
0:9:0,643 --> 0:9:2,684
It's all right, isn't it?


72
0:9:2,684 --> 0:9:21,979
It looks really,
really fucking stupid.


73
0:9:21,979 --> 0:9:24,771
Can't you go any faster, Billy?
I'm racing in the back here.


74
0:9:24,771 --> 0:9:29,646
I thought you were supposed
to be Billy fuckin' Whizz.


75
0:9:29,646 --> 0:9:34,605
It's all come from the doors.
You run the doors, and you
control what get inside.


76
0:9:34,605 --> 0:9:37,814
Clubs don't give a shit.
Just don't want any aggro.


77
0:9:37,814 --> 0:9:41,564
Most weeks now, we're...
turning over 20 grand.


78
0:9:41,564 --> 0:9:43,856
- Yeah?
- Mm.


79
0:9:43,856 --> 0:9:46,648
Fucking hell.


80
0:9:46,648 --> 0:9:48,982
We, uh, do a bit of weed
in the week maybe,


81
0:9:48,982 --> 0:9:51,691
but pills is where
the money's really at.


82
0:9:51,691 --> 0:9:53,608
I keep away from them
when they're on them.


83
0:9:53,608 --> 0:9:57,15
Fucking eyes all go wonky, don't they?
He's done 'em, soppy nuts.


84
0:9:57,15 --> 0:9:59,9
I won't touch 'em meself.


85
0:9:59,9 --> 0:10:2,9
They're not for you, Jase.
They make you wanna love everyone.


86
0:10:2,9 --> 0:10:18,277
I love you!


87
0:10:18,277 --> 0:10:30,237
Pull in here, Billy Whizz.


88
0:10:30,237 --> 0:10:32,154
What's happened to the Honeycomb?


89
0:10:32,154 --> 0:10:35,196
Half a million on a refit,
and it's now called Blondz.


90
0:10:35,196 --> 0:10:37,78
- Packed every night of the week.
- Is it still ours?


91
0:10:37,78 --> 0:10:40,697
No. They gave it
to that prick, Perry Elley.


92
0:10:40,697 --> 0:10:42,614
Perry fucking Elley?


93
0:10:42,614 --> 0:10:44,531
Yeah. It's him and us now, Jase.


94
0:10:44,531 --> 0:10:46,489
That fucking wanker.


95
0:10:46,489 --> 0:10:48,364
He was knocking out
dodgy Sierras.


96
0:10:48,364 --> 0:10:51,656
Yeah, well, he's moved in
on the doors now, like us,


97
0:10:51,656 --> 0:10:53,573
'cause that's
where the money is.


98
0:10:53,573 --> 0:11:2,116
Every door he gets is one
we could be making money from.
You know what I'm saying, Jase?


99
0:11:2,116 --> 0:11:4,33
Billy.


100
0:11:4,33 --> 0:11:6,825
I want you to pull up outside
in exactly five minutes, yeah?


101
0:11:6,825 --> 0:11:9,117
- Sure.
- Don't fuck about.


102
0:11:9,117 --> 0:12:12,542
You make sure
you're right outside.


103
0:12:12,542 --> 0:12:14,417
You all right, Nic?


104
0:12:14,417 --> 0:12:18,626
All right, listen, darling,
I don't think I'm gonna be
back till about midnight.


105
0:12:18,626 --> 0:12:20,918
Yeah. No, it's nothing
like that.


106
0:12:20,918 --> 0:12:23,71
No, I'm just waiting
for 'em outside Blondz in Southend.


107
0:12:23,71 --> 0:12:26,502
You know, the one
with the glass.


108
0:12:26,502 --> 0:12:29,835
Nic, I gotta go.


109
0:12:29,835 --> 0:12:42,379
Bloody hell, they've
thrown him from the bloody window.


110
0:12:42,379 --> 0:12:45,837
Leave him!


111
0:12:45,837 --> 0:12:56,214
Fuckin' leave him!


112
0:12:56,214 --> 0:12:58,631
Go forward!


113
0:12:58,631 --> 0:13:24,509
Go forward and run the bastard over!
We ain't got time to fuck up about.


114
0:13:24,509 --> 0:13:31,385
Careful, Billy Whizz.


115
0:13:31,385 --> 0:13:33,76
Fucking amateur!


116
0:13:33,76 --> 0:13:36,177
Shit!


117
0:13:36,177 --> 0:13:56,93
Oh, God!


118
0:13:56,93 --> 0:14:10,931
Get down.


119
0:14:10,931 --> 0:14:13,348
You are fucking Billy Whizz.


120
0:14:13,348 --> 0:14:42,477
Yeah. Let's move.


121
0:14:42,477 --> 0:14:45,19
Well done, Billy Whizz.
You did all right.


122
0:14:45,19 --> 0:14:48,103
Yeah, nice one, Billy.


123
0:14:48,103 --> 0:14:50,353
What do you think
of the barnet, Billy?


124
0:14:50,353 --> 0:14:52,728
- It's all right, isn't it?
- Yeah, it looks all right.


125
0:14:52,728 --> 0:14:54,687
See, I told you.


126
0:14:54,687 --> 0:14:57,354
And this boy knows
what he's talking about.


127
0:14:57,354 --> 0:15:44,235
Mm, pair of fucking poofs.


128
0:15:44,235 --> 0:15:57,695
Nicole. Nicole.


129
0:15:57,695 --> 0:16:1,82
Oi, look. Ta-da.


130
0:16:1,82 --> 0:16:5,71
Ta-da!


131
0:16:5,71 --> 0:16:8,29
You said you was going to be back
at 12:00, Billy.


132
0:16:8,29 --> 0:16:10,446
I know. I'm sorry.


133
0:16:10,446 --> 0:16:13,197
I've had a right result, though.
Look at that, 500 quid.


134
0:16:13,197 --> 0:16:18,864
That's for one night's work.


135
0:16:18,864 --> 0:16:25,615
- Where are you going?
- I needa wee.


136
0:16:25,615 --> 0:16:27,532
So, what happened?


137
0:16:27,532 --> 0:16:29,949
Well, it just seemed to go on,
and I couldn't get away.


138
0:16:29,949 --> 0:16:33,199
If I'd known you was going
to be out all night, I wouldn't
have bothered coming around.


139
0:16:33,199 --> 0:16:36,366
- I'm sorry.
- I've got to pick up Candice
in a couple of hours.


140
0:16:36,366 --> 0:16:38,533
Yeah, but that's 500 quid.
It's not bad, is it?


141
0:16:38,533 --> 0:16:42,75
That's just for driving them
about. And I tell you what,
they're well pleased with me.


142
0:16:42,75 --> 0:16:46,117
All of a sudden,
I have just become Billy Whizz.


143
0:16:46,117 --> 0:16:49,826
It's like Billy Whizz this
and Billy Whizz that.


144
0:16:49,826 --> 0:16:51,91
- Better than cabbing, isn't it?
- o you mind?


145
0:16:51,91 --> 0:16:53,868
Sorry.


146
0:16:53,868 --> 0:16:56,327
They'll want me again tomorrow.


147
0:16:56,327 --> 0:16:59,494
Thank you very much.


148
0:16:59,494 --> 0:17:1,369
Come on, get into bed.


149
0:17:1,369 --> 0:17:15,954
Warm me up.
Make yourself useful.


150
0:17:15,954 --> 0:17:18,205
The following night, I'm out with them again.


151
0:17:18,205 --> 0:17:20,372
Pete Chaseruns the security
at Dantes,


152
0:17:20,372 --> 0:17:22,955
which means I don't have to queue up
with all the other mugs,


153
0:17:22,955 --> 0:17:24,914
which is nice.


154
0:17:24,914 --> 0:17:45,875
Billy Whizz, come on, son.
You're with the A-team now.


155
0:17:45,875 --> 0:17:47,833
Who's he, Billy?


156
0:17:47,833 --> 0:17:50,292
Oh, my God, that's Jason Locke,
isn't it?


157
0:17:50,292 --> 0:17:52,209
He's just come out.


158
0:17:52,209 --> 0:17:54,834
did she?


159
0:17:54,834 --> 0:17:58,96
It's a simple question,
and I want an answer.


160
0:17:58,96 --> 0:18:2,502
Why'd you have to ask me?


161
0:18:2,502 --> 0:18:4,377
It's insulting.


162
0:18:4,377 --> 0:18:7,211
No is the answer.
Absolutely not. No.


163
0:18:7,211 --> 0:18:9,128
did you see her
spending time with anyone?


164
0:18:9,128 --> 0:18:11,378
Come on, Jase.
I just told you.


165
0:18:11,378 --> 0:18:14,128
That I know of,
she didn't mess around.


166
0:18:14,128 --> 0:18:27,505
What do you mean,
"that you know of"?


167
0:18:27,505 --> 0:18:30,255
Hey, Billy Whizz,
come over here.


168
0:18:30,255 --> 0:18:35,881
Stay there.


169
0:18:35,881 --> 0:18:37,84
How you doing, Billy?


170
0:18:37,84 --> 0:18:47,91
- Not too bad, Mr. Chase.
- Call me, Peter.


171
0:18:47,91 --> 0:18:49,8
- All right?
- Are you Jason?


172
0:18:49,8 --> 0:18:51,133
Yeah.


173
0:18:51,133 --> 0:18:54,8
What you gonna do when you've finished
with Jason, go back to cabbing?


174
0:18:54,8 --> 0:18:56,175
Er, yeah. I mean, I thought
I might do the knowledge.


175
0:18:56,175 --> 0:18:59,342
- You know what I mean, do it properly.
- That's a hard game, that.


176
0:18:59,342 --> 0:19:3,1
All them fuckin' tests. Sloggin'
about onmopeds. Goodluck to you, boy.


177
0:19:3,1 --> 0:19:5,218
Well, you've gotta
do something, ain't ya?


178
0:19:5,218 --> 0:19:7,885
I don't like to see anybody
work when they don't have to.


179
0:19:7,885 --> 0:19:10,302
And you're
a bright bloke, Billy.


180
0:19:10,302 --> 0:19:13,969
We've been very impressed
with you. Very impressed.


181
0:19:13,969 --> 0:19:16,553
We'd like to make you
an offer.


182
0:19:16,553 --> 0:19:19,345
How about when you finish driving Jason
around, you don't go back to cabbing?


183
0:19:19,345 --> 0:19:22,47
How about you stay
driving for us?


184
0:19:22,47 --> 0:19:27,221
- What, you mean...
- I mean, you work full-time for us.


185
0:19:27,221 --> 0:19:29,805
What's the matter, Billy?


186
0:19:29,805 --> 0:19:32,597
You saw a few things last night,
Billy, but, er, well...


187
0:19:32,597 --> 0:19:37,972
in my book...
makes you one of the boys.


188
0:19:37,972 --> 0:19:41,806
Yeah, but you know I'd never
say nothing about last night, don't ya?


189
0:19:41,806 --> 0:19:46,557
Oh, yeah. I know that, Billy.
I know I can trust you.


190
0:19:46,557 --> 0:19:51,307
It was either that, Billy,
or we stick a knife in ya.


191
0:19:51,307 --> 0:19:57,558
Bing.


192
0:19:57,558 --> 0:20:0,558
did you speak to Peter
about the business?


193
0:20:0,558 --> 0:20:2,434
Pete's me mate.


194
0:20:2,434 --> 0:20:4,392
Yeah.


195
0:20:4,392 --> 0:20:8,101
You tell him you want to
be his partner, not his mate.


196
0:20:8,101 --> 0:20:10,6
He'll sort me out,
all right.


197
0:20:10,6 --> 0:20:12,393
Look. I know how they work.
I've been watching them.


198
0:20:12,393 --> 0:20:14,268
There's too many people
in the chain.


199
0:20:14,268 --> 0:20:16,227
What fucking chain?
What are you on about?


200
0:20:16,227 --> 0:20:19,394
Jason!


201
0:20:19,394 --> 0:20:22,561
Anyway...


202
0:20:22,561 --> 0:20:26,478
he's given me
some spending money.


203
0:20:26,478 --> 0:20:37,48
It's in me pocket.


204
0:20:37,48 --> 0:20:41,689
It's five grand.


205
0:20:41,689 --> 0:20:48,398
A thousand a year...
that's all you're worth to him.


206
0:20:48,398 --> 0:20:51,856
That's just for starters.


207
0:20:51,856 --> 0:20:55,65
Anyway, what was I supposed to do,
grass them up like Chippy?


208
0:20:55,65 --> 0:20:57,732
Oh, no, he knewy ou wouldn't
do that. You were a sure thing.


209
0:20:57,732 --> 0:21:1,66
Yeah?And what about you?
You're asure thing.


210
0:21:1,66 --> 0:21:3,108
Yeah, I'm a sure thing.


211
0:21:3,108 --> 0:21:5,567
Yeah? Well, you waited
for me, did ya?


212
0:21:5,567 --> 0:21:7,858
All that time for five years,
did ya?


213
0:21:7,858 --> 0:21:9,984
didn't let anyone inside your knickers
while I was away?


214
0:21:9,984 --> 0:21:11,651
What's brought this on?


215
0:21:11,651 --> 0:21:13,859
Wh-Why didn't you
just say no?


216
0:21:13,859 --> 0:21:16,776
Why did you have to fuck about
being clever?


217
0:21:16,776 --> 0:21:19,485
Why didn't you just say no?


218
0:21:19,485 --> 0:21:21,402
Because I was at it
all the time.


219
0:21:21,402 --> 0:21:25,277
I had so much cock I started
a cock factory... big, fat, small, short.


220
0:21:25,277 --> 0:21:28,236
- Anyone bought me a drink,
I fucked them in our bed.
- Shut up!


221
0:21:28,236 --> 0:21:30,278
- Shut up!
- Just for the price ofa drink!


222
0:21:30,278 --> 0:21:32,403
Shut up! Shut your fucking mouth!


223
0:21:32,403 --> 0:21:38,821
Shut up!
Fucking shut up!


224
0:21:38,821 --> 0:21:45,71
Why do you have to ask me?


225
0:21:45,71 --> 0:21:51,614
Because I'm a jealous fucking bastard,
and I don't trust you.


226
0:21:51,614 --> 0:21:54,239
I'm sorry.


227
0:21:54,239 --> 0:21:57,74
If I was gonna mess about,
I'd have done it a long time ago.


228
0:21:57,74 --> 0:22:0,448
Yeah, I know.


229
0:22:0,448 --> 0:22:2,615
Jason.


230
0:22:2,615 --> 0:22:7,449
I waited for you
because I believe in you.


231
0:22:7,449 --> 0:22:22,76
I don't ever want handouts
from them again. We can't
go back to how it was before.


232
0:22:22,76 --> 0:22:26,702
You get in that bedroom.


233
0:22:26,702 --> 0:23:33,877
You get in that bedroom.


234
0:23:33,877 --> 0:23:35,877
I get a call from Mr. D.


235
0:23:35,877 --> 0:23:38,794
I mean, strictly speaking,
I'm still working for him.


236
0:23:38,794 --> 0:23:41,753
He's asked me to pick up Henry
and drive him to this place.


237
0:23:41,753 --> 0:23:44,336
I've never been there before,
some farm.


238
0:23:44,336 --> 0:23:47,128
I just thought probably not a good idea
to tell Jason and the others...


239
0:23:47,128 --> 0:24:23,716
about where I was going
that night.


240
0:24:23,716 --> 0:24:26,55
Old Henry Hobbs never said much.


241
0:24:26,55 --> 0:24:29,592
And when he did, hes till never said much.


242
0:24:29,592 --> 0:24:47,553
Switch.


243
0:24:47,553 --> 0:24:50,261
The pilotis Mr. D.


244
0:24:50,261 --> 0:24:52,137
Wow.


245
0:24:52,137 --> 0:24:56,512
Dropped it down sweet as you like,
just like he said he could.


246
0:24:56,512 --> 0:24:59,596
This is fucking fantastic.


247
0:24:59,596 --> 0:25:3,221
- Can touch down and be in the air
again in less than 30 seconds.
- Right.


248
0:25:3,221 --> 0:25:7,763
The other chap is Peter Chase's
big rival on the club scene,
the infamous Perry Elley.


249
0:25:7,763 --> 0:25:11,222
You just keep yourself wrapped in cotton
wool for awhile and we're home and dry.


250
0:25:11,222 --> 0:25:13,973
Mr. D. and Perry had been hatching
this one for months.


251
0:25:13,973 --> 0:25:15,931
This was the final
dress rehearsal.


252
0:25:15,931 --> 0:25:19,64
Boys, this is gonna work.


253
0:25:19,64 --> 0:25:22,432
So, John Dyke... Mr. D...


254
0:25:22,432 --> 0:25:24,349
he was the one
who got me into this.


255
0:25:24,349 --> 0:25:26,766
I was doing me cabbing,
and I picked him up one day.


256
0:25:26,766 --> 0:25:29,85
We had a little chat and got talking,
and he asked for me again.


257
0:25:29,85 --> 0:25:32,933
I used to deliver things for him,
packages, and drive a few people about.


258
0:25:32,933 --> 0:25:44,893
But I didn't ask any questions.
I think he liked that.


259
0:25:44,893 --> 0:25:46,768
What do you make of Jason?


260
0:25:46,768 --> 0:25:50,602
I wouldn't like to get on the wrong
side of him. He's an 18-carat nutter.


261
0:25:50,602 --> 0:25:54,936
- He's kept you busy.
- Yeah.


262
0:25:54,936 --> 0:25:58,728
Actually, um, him and his pals
have asked me to do a bit
of driving about for 'em.


263
0:25:58,728 --> 0:26:1,312
Well, full-time.


264
0:26:1,312 --> 0:26:3,27
How do you feel about that?


265
0:26:3,27 --> 0:26:5,187
I don't know.


266
0:26:5,187 --> 0:26:7,438
Thought, "Why not?"


267
0:26:7,438 --> 0:26:9,313
I mean, they're all right.
They look after me.


268
0:26:9,313 --> 0:26:12,23
I wouldn't mind seeing
where it'd take me.


269
0:26:12,23 --> 0:26:15,397
I can still do a bit of driving for you.
That's no ta problem, is it?


270
0:26:15,397 --> 0:26:18,106
Well, good luck to you, Billy.


271
0:26:18,106 --> 0:26:21,814
do you think
it's a bad idea?


272
0:26:21,814 --> 0:26:46,401
It's not for me to say.


273
0:26:46,401 --> 0:26:48,776
Now it's starting to get complicated.


274
0:26:48,776 --> 0:26:51,568
Straightaway, Peter Chase asked me
to do a little job for him.


275
0:26:51,568 --> 0:27:26,197
I drive 'em to this burger bar,
and they tell me to wait.


276
0:27:26,197 --> 0:27:36,615
Police, stop!


277
0:27:36,615 --> 0:27:38,574
Armed police!


278
0:27:38,574 --> 0:27:41,449
Sit.


279
0:27:41,449 --> 0:27:55,159
I just lost
200 fucking grand.


280
0:27:55,159 --> 0:27:57,326
How'd it go?


281
0:27:57,326 --> 0:27:59,243
A total disaster.


282
0:27:59,243 --> 0:28:2,994
Couriers got arrested.
We lost thegear.


283
0:28:2,994 --> 0:28:6,619
Pete lost his money.


284
0:28:6,619 --> 0:28:12,12
Couldn't have gone
much better really, could it?


285
0:28:12,12 --> 0:28:15,12
- Oh! Oh, God!
- Eh?


286
0:28:15,12 --> 0:28:17,79
- Are you gonna see him then, babe?
- Yeah.


287
0:28:17,79 --> 0:28:19,246
Oh!


288
0:28:19,246 --> 0:28:23,121
Now he owes you, you know that.
Now's the time to call in the debt.


289
0:28:23,121 --> 0:28:42,165
Yeah, I know.


290
0:28:42,165 --> 0:28:44,457
What was her name again,
that blond one at the club?


291
0:28:44,457 --> 0:28:47,249
- Suzy.
- Yeah.


292
0:28:47,249 --> 0:28:50,333
She had a beautiful
little arse.


293
0:28:50,333 --> 0:28:52,292
You get her number
for me, yeah?


294
0:28:52,292 --> 0:29:32,963
Either her arse or your arse,
Billy Whizz.


295
0:29:32,963 --> 0:29:37,964
Welcome back, Jason.


296
0:29:37,964 --> 0:29:39,881
You didn't tell me
you were rich, John.


297
0:29:39,881 --> 0:29:42,631
I'm not rich.


298
0:29:42,631 --> 0:29:52,799
Everybody's suddenly rich
while I'm inside.


299
0:29:52,799 --> 0:29:57,3
It's a nice place, John.


300
0:29:57,3 --> 0:30:0,467
Could easily get a swimming pool
in this garden. Yeah.


301
0:30:0,467 --> 0:30:3,175
Nice pool with a cover on it.


302
0:30:3,175 --> 0:30:7,884
Gym upstairs.


303
0:30:7,884 --> 0:30:10,135
I could handle that.


304
0:30:10,135 --> 0:30:13,635
I leave the garden to Henry.
That's his domain.


305
0:30:13,635 --> 0:30:18,344
- Cheers.
- Cheers, John.


306
0:30:18,344 --> 0:30:22,386
I'm very grateful for what
you did for me inside, Jason.


307
0:30:22,386 --> 0:30:24,886
That's all right.


308
0:30:24,886 --> 0:30:26,97
I was wondering whether
I could repay the favor.


309
0:30:26,97 --> 0:30:30,387
Is there anything
I can do for you?


310
0:30:30,387 --> 0:30:33,429
Well, if you're asking,
John, maybe there is.


311
0:30:33,429 --> 0:30:36,18
I've got some friends who need
some gear brought into the country.


312
0:30:36,18 --> 0:30:42,139
- Gear?
- Naughty gear, John.


313
0:30:42,139 --> 0:30:44,139
All right, Henry?


314
0:30:44,139 --> 0:30:46,264
How's it going?


315
0:30:46,264 --> 0:30:49,473
Been having a lot of trouble
with drainage.


316
0:30:49,473 --> 0:30:53,39
Clay soil round here.
Water lies on the surface.


317
0:30:53,39 --> 0:30:55,724
Heavy rain drowns
everything off.


318
0:30:55,724 --> 0:31:0,183
Yeah. Gutting when
that happens, isn't it?


319
0:31:0,183 --> 0:31:2,141
All right, come on.
Come on.


320
0:31:2,141 --> 0:31:7,225
The truth is I work just for
one person now, then only occasionally.


321
0:31:7,225 --> 0:31:9,642
Working outside that arrangement
would be too dangerous.


322
0:31:9,642 --> 0:31:11,601
And, you see, I...


323
0:31:11,601 --> 0:31:16,81
I simply cannot
go to prison again... ever.


324
0:31:16,81 --> 0:31:19,227
Well, you think
about it, John.


325
0:31:19,227 --> 0:31:21,143
See if you can't
get your head around it.


326
0:31:21,143 --> 0:31:24,61
See, the way I see it,


327
0:31:24,61 --> 0:31:27,853
people with special
relationships, like us;


328
0:31:27,853 --> 0:31:30,436
people who've got secrets,
like us...


329
0:31:30,436 --> 0:31:33,312
Yeah? Well,
we should stick together.


330
0:31:33,312 --> 0:31:35,562
Oh, yes, yes,
I agree with you, Jason.


331
0:31:35,562 --> 0:31:39,646
That's why I-I'd be, uh, I'd be happy
to help you out fi nancially,


332
0:31:39,646 --> 0:31:41,813
- until you get on your feet.
- Mm. No, no.


333
0:31:41,813 --> 0:31:45,105
I don't want your money.


334
0:31:45,105 --> 0:31:48,689
I'm looking to the future
now, John.


335
0:31:48,689 --> 0:32:1,774
I wanna go into
business with you.


336
0:32:1,774 --> 0:32:3,649
Welcome home, Jason.


337
0:32:3,649 --> 0:32:5,607
Thanks for keeping
your mouth shut.


338
0:32:5,607 --> 0:32:8,733
One or two of the boys have overdone
the sunbed tonight, but we're all here.


339
0:32:8,733 --> 0:32:10,65
And we're wondering
what's next.


340
0:32:10,65 --> 0:32:24,86
Come on.


341
0:32:24,86 --> 0:32:26,902
Look at this!
Look, look at this!


342
0:32:26,902 --> 0:32:29,69
Hello, leader.
How are you doing?


343
0:32:29,69 --> 0:32:32,986
Oi! Billy Whizz, drinks.
Tell Tommy to get the scotch.


344
0:32:32,986 --> 0:32:34,861
The good stuff,
the malt, all right?


345
0:32:34,861 --> 0:32:38,778
Oi, you little sods. Hey, come on,
this is not a toy. Off you get!


346
0:32:38,778 --> 0:32:41,654
Hey, Beverley. Beverley, would you
come and look after these sods?


347
0:32:41,654 --> 0:32:43,654
Jason Locke!


348
0:32:43,654 --> 0:32:49,446
Out from under lock and key at last.
Here he is! Yea!


349
0:32:49,446 --> 0:32:52,822
That's the color of the moon


350
0:32:52,822 --> 0:32:55,155
Secretin the rainbow


351
0:32:55,155 --> 0:32:57,114
Him, with Jason...


352
0:32:57,114 --> 0:32:59,947
that's his old mate,
Kiri Christos, the banker.


353
0:32:59,947 --> 0:33:3,156
Well, geezers couldn't very well
go to the NatWest, could they?


354
0:33:3,156 --> 0:33:13,533
So, they went to him.


355
0:33:13,533 --> 0:33:17,116
You are looking
just as beautiful as ever.


356
0:33:17,116 --> 0:33:19,33
- Oh!
- Beautiful!


357
0:33:19,33 --> 0:33:20,992
Oh, and fiery!


358
0:33:20,992 --> 0:33:23,742
Oh, yes, it's that
Peter Chase spouting off.


359
0:33:23,742 --> 0:33:25,784
Oh, my God, Kiri!


360
0:33:25,784 --> 0:33:28,993
Can you believe it? We're in
our thirties. I feel so ancient.


361
0:33:28,993 --> 0:33:31,451
If I looked as good as you,
it wouldn't bother me much.


362
0:33:31,451 --> 0:33:34,702
o you know how upsetting it is to have
hair coming out your nose and ears?


363
0:33:34,702 --> 0:33:37,536
That's what they should have told us
in biology, not how to cut up...


364
0:33:37,536 --> 0:33:39,494
What were they, locusts?


365
0:33:39,494 --> 0:33:45,36
You always did make me laugh.


366
0:33:45,36 --> 0:33:47,203
Jason says he wants to
go into business.


367
0:33:47,203 --> 0:33:49,12
Yeah, well,
isn't it about time he did?


368
0:33:49,12 --> 0:33:52,871
- Haven't they made enough money
off his back?
- So, he needs a banker.


369
0:33:52,871 --> 0:33:55,954
- But he's got a problem.
- What's that?


370
0:33:55,954 --> 0:33:59,288
- He's got no security.
- Okay. How's he get that?


371
0:33:59,288 --> 0:34:2,997
Well, he needs to put up
something against the loan.


372
0:34:2,997 --> 0:34:7,498
Something valuable.
Something I want.


373
0:34:7,498 --> 0:34:9,998
I didn't know Jason had
anything you wanted.


374
0:34:9,998 --> 0:34:17,832
Well, you haven't been paying much
attention all these years, have you?


375
0:34:17,832 --> 0:34:20,333
Kiri, um,


376
0:34:20,333 --> 0:34:22,291
would you just excuse me
a minute?


377
0:34:22,291 --> 0:34:35,293
It was just getting interesting.


378
0:34:35,293 --> 0:34:38,1
- All right?
- Who's that?


379
0:34:38,1 --> 0:34:42,835
don't know. I just said
hello to her tonight.


380
0:34:42,835 --> 0:34:45,794
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- I said, "Who is she?"


381
0:34:45,794 --> 0:34:47,836
don't know.Just some little bird
Billy's knocking off.


382
0:34:47,836 --> 0:34:49,753
Anyway, it went well
with Kiri.


383
0:34:49,753 --> 0:34:54,795
don't shame me, Jason.


384
0:34:54,795 --> 0:34:57,254
- Beverley, all right?
- Mm.


385
0:34:57,254 --> 0:34:59,587
- So, what you been up to then, Lisa?
- Oh, you know,


386
0:34:59,587 --> 0:35:1,588
getting beasted by Jason.


387
0:35:1,588 --> 0:35:4,796
When they've been inside for so long,
they want to do it up the arse.


388
0:35:4,796 --> 0:35:8,839
If that's what your mate's been
doing to you for five years,
it's bound to have an efect.


389
0:35:8,839 --> 0:35:10,797
- Anyway, what about you girls?
- Oh, yeah.


390
0:35:10,797 --> 0:35:13,381
I didn't tell you what Pete bought me
for Christmas, did I?


391
0:35:13,381 --> 0:35:16,881
A horse.
I've called him Toby.


392
0:35:16,881 --> 0:35:19,923
- Oh, he's mad, isn't he?
- Put him down then.


393
0:35:19,923 --> 0:35:21,84
And the horse.


394
0:35:21,84 --> 0:35:25,507
I'm trying to be nice to you, Lisa.
Oh, you've got a short memory, babe.


395
0:35:25,507 --> 0:35:28,591
Bit too quick to forget who's been
helping you while Jason's been inside?


396
0:35:28,591 --> 0:35:31,841
Two hundred and fifty quid a week?
Helping us out? do me a favor.


397
0:35:31,841 --> 0:35:34,592
Well, I didn't expect for one minute
that you'd be grateful.


398
0:35:34,592 --> 0:35:39,9
Okay, Beverley. I'm so fucking grateful.
Will that do?


399
0:35:39,9 --> 0:35:42,801
Oo-er. You just make sure you enjoy
this party tonight, darling,


400
0:35:42,801 --> 0:35:45,176
'cause it's the last thing
you're gonna get from us.


401
0:35:45,176 --> 0:35:50,177
Make sure you keep your legs
pressed tight together when you
ride Toby, make you all tingly.


402
0:35:50,177 --> 0:35:53,177
You do remember that feeling,
don't you?


403
0:35:53,177 --> 0:35:55,469
- Who's a naughty boy then?
- What?


404
0:35:55,469 --> 0:35:58,553
That little blond bit. That's why
you didn't bring your girlfriend.


405
0:35:58,553 --> 0:36:0,845
Who, her? No, she's not
with me. She's just...


406
0:36:0,845 --> 0:36:3,97
Well, she's with anyone,
if you know what I mean.


407
0:36:3,97 --> 0:36:23,39
Where is she?


408
0:36:23,39 --> 0:36:29,682
Groaning Continues]


409
0:36:29,682 --> 0:36:33,516
Oh, shit.


410
0:36:33,516 --> 0:36:35,849
You bastard.


411
0:36:35,849 --> 0:36:41,58
You do this here
in front of everyone.


412
0:36:41,58 --> 0:36:44,309
You bastard! Bastard!


413
0:36:44,309 --> 0:36:46,184
- Fucking bastard!
- Shut up!


414
0:36:46,184 --> 0:36:49,226
- You bastard! Get off me!
- Shut your fucking mouth!


415
0:36:49,226 --> 0:36:51,31
Just fucking cool off!


416
0:36:51,31 --> 0:36:54,852
Go on, fucking cool off!
You think you own me?


417
0:36:54,852 --> 0:36:58,102
"do this, Jason. do that, Jason."
Well, fuck you!


418
0:36:58,102 --> 0:37:2,978
I waited for you for five years!


419
0:37:2,978 --> 0:37:6,2
Yeah, you waited for me, did you?
You think I'm fucking stupid?


420
0:37:6,2 --> 0:37:9,979
- I didn't do anything!
- I don't believe you.


421
0:37:9,979 --> 0:37:13,979
I didn't do anything!


422
0:37:13,979 --> 0:37:20,938
Fuck off! You're like
a fucking leech!


423
0:37:20,938 --> 0:37:23,522
What the fuck
do I need you for, eh?


424
0:37:23,522 --> 0:37:26,22
I mean, why do you think
I go with other women, eh?


425
0:37:26,22 --> 0:37:27,939
Because you're
a fucking nuisance!


426
0:37:27,939 --> 0:37:30,356
You're not even a good fuck!


427
0:37:30,356 --> 0:37:32,232
I don't even fancy you anymore.


428
0:37:32,232 --> 0:37:34,482
That's a lie!


429
0:37:34,482 --> 0:37:36,399
That's a lie!


430
0:37:36,399 --> 0:38:10,57
Get her out of here.


431
0:38:10,57 --> 0:38:12,653
You all right?


432
0:38:12,653 --> 0:38:16,654
That bastard's done this
to me before.


433
0:38:16,654 --> 0:38:19,29
He got the last one pregnant.


434
0:38:19,29 --> 0:38:22,529
Another little blond bit.


435
0:38:22,529 --> 0:38:25,822
He had a little boy with her.


436
0:38:25,822 --> 0:38:29,155
You see...


437
0:38:29,155 --> 0:38:32,989
I can't have kids, Billy.


438
0:38:32,989 --> 0:38:35,448
That was a fucking laugh,
weren't it, for everyone else?


439
0:38:35,448 --> 0:38:40,907
Everyone looking at me, knowing.


440
0:38:40,907 --> 0:38:59,159
The joke is...
I actually waited for him.


441
0:38:59,159 --> 0:39:4,243
I used to sit
behind him in class.


442
0:39:4,243 --> 0:39:7,868
did you know that?


443
0:39:7,868 --> 0:39:12,119
I thought he was God's gift.


444
0:39:12,119 --> 0:39:15,828
All the girls fancied him.


445
0:39:15,828 --> 0:39:19,203
But I got him.


446
0:39:19,203 --> 0:39:25,537
I thought I was
such a lucky girl.


447
0:39:25,537 --> 0:39:34,955
Mm.


448
0:39:34,955 --> 0:39:37,205
Lisa. Lisa!


449
0:39:37,205 --> 0:39:40,123
Wait, hold on. I don't think
we should, all right.


450
0:39:40,123 --> 0:39:45,4
It's not that
I don't want to.


451
0:39:45,4 --> 0:39:52,624
Thanks, Billy.


452
0:39:52,624 --> 0:39:58,291
Thanks for not taking advantage of me
when I'm like this.


453
0:39:58,291 --> 0:40:3,0
Most of the other guys
would have jumped on me.


454
0:40:3,0 --> 0:40:6,626
You're different.


455
0:40:6,626 --> 0:40:10,168
Thanks.


456
0:40:10,168 --> 0:40:13,21
Um, it's just, um, you know...


457
0:40:13,21 --> 0:40:17,586
Billy. Billy, I'm taking
the piss out of you.


458
0:40:17,586 --> 0:40:19,544
Look at you.
You're no good to me.


459
0:40:19,544 --> 0:40:23,92
You're just a fucking pussy
like all the rest of them.


460
0:40:23,92 --> 0:40:50,381
Bring my bag.


461
0:40:50,381 --> 0:40:52,715
Tell Billy the groceries
are ready.


462
0:40:52,715 --> 0:41:49,555
I want this over
as quickly as possible.


463
0:41:49,555 --> 0:41:57,265
- All right? It's all in there.
- Yeah.


464
0:41:57,265 --> 0:42:0,39
You fucking beauty.


465
0:42:0,39 --> 0:42:2,807
There you go.


466
0:42:2,807 --> 0:42:5,141
Thanks.


467
0:42:5,141 --> 0:42:7,58
See you later.


468
0:42:7,58 --> 0:42:14,225
Have fun.


469
0:42:14,225 --> 0:42:17,225
Spotty dogs.


470
0:42:17,225 --> 0:42:21,726
Seen them, Billy?


471
0:42:21,726 --> 0:42:24,143
No.


472
0:42:24,143 --> 0:42:26,435
Here you are.


473
0:42:26,435 --> 0:42:29,435
Try one.


474
0:42:29,435 --> 0:42:31,352
Cheers, Wayne.


475
0:42:31,352 --> 0:42:35,144
Now, Jason is very anti-drugs.


476
0:42:35,144 --> 0:42:37,395
Thatis anti anyone else's drugs.


477
0:42:37,395 --> 0:42:40,978
It's an odanda wink and in goes
his man with a bag of Spotty Dogs.


478
0:42:40,978 --> 0:42:44,354
Thank you very much.


479
0:42:44,354 --> 0:42:50,48
See you later.


480
0:42:50,48 --> 0:42:54,522
- Oi!
- All right?


481
0:42:54,522 --> 0:42:56,897
- How's it going?
- Sweet.


482
0:42:56,897 --> 0:42:58,814
This is a piece of piss.


483
0:42:58,814 --> 0:43:1,231
What are we looking at
when we knock this lot out?


484
0:43:1,231 --> 0:43:3,648
I don't know,
200, maybe 250 profit.


485
0:43:3,648 --> 0:43:6,648
Quarter of a million?
Fuckin' hell!


486
0:43:6,648 --> 0:43:10,732
You've done well, Jase. You've come
through for us, just when we needed it.


487
0:43:10,732 --> 0:43:13,191
You know what this is?
It's a contract...


488
0:43:13,191 --> 0:43:16,316
to provide security for
Blondz nightclub in Southend.


489
0:43:16,316 --> 0:43:19,775
Sorted it out with the owners.
Got fed up with the other lot.
Too much aggravation.


490
0:43:19,775 --> 0:43:23,609
People flying through windows.
Perry Elley's out, we're in.


491
0:43:23,609 --> 0:43:26,651
Partners?


492
0:43:26,651 --> 0:43:43,695
Partners.


493
0:43:43,695 --> 0:43:48,737
I fuckin' love it here.
don'tyou?


494
0:43:48,737 --> 0:43:51,571
I tell you, I'm never going back
inside again, I tell you that.


495
0:43:51,571 --> 0:43:54,154
Where do you live, Billy?


496
0:43:54,154 --> 0:43:55,988
I'm in Canvey Island.


497
0:43:55,988 --> 0:43:59,53
Yeah?


498
0:43:59,53 --> 0:44:3,489
There she is!Hey!


499
0:44:3,489 --> 0:44:6,239
Bring the motor. Hey!


500
0:44:6,239 --> 0:44:8,114
Hey.


501
0:44:8,114 --> 0:44:10,365
Jason, I didn't mean to cause
any trouble the other night.


502
0:44:10,365 --> 0:44:12,282
- I'm really sorry.
- That's all right.


503
0:44:12,282 --> 0:44:14,198
Get in the motor.
Let's have a laugh.


504
0:44:14,198 --> 0:44:16,157
- I didn't know you were married.
- I'm divorced.


505
0:44:16,157 --> 0:44:18,282
do you wanna marry me?
do you wanna get married?


506
0:44:18,282 --> 0:44:20,366
Billy. Billy,
you can be the witness.


507
0:44:20,366 --> 0:44:28,492
- I don't wanna cause any trouble.
- Well, I do. Come on.


508
0:44:28,492 --> 0:44:32,367
drive, Billy Whizz.


509
0:44:32,367 --> 0:44:42,785
Give me a couple of them Spotty dogs,
will you, Billy?


510
0:44:42,785 --> 0:44:46,953
Okay. Let's see
what this shit's like.


511
0:44:46,953 --> 0:44:49,286
No, Jason, please.
Please, will you just take me home?


512
0:44:49,286 --> 0:44:52,412
No chance.


513
0:44:52,412 --> 0:45:10,872
That's it.


514
0:45:10,872 --> 0:45:12,872
You and me, Billy Whizz.


515
0:45:12,872 --> 0:45:23,582
We'll run
that fuckin' gaff, eh?


516
0:45:23,582 --> 0:45:25,624
Nice one.


517
0:45:25,624 --> 0:45:27,833
You got some booze,
Billy Whizz?


518
0:45:27,833 --> 0:45:29,916
There's loads up there, Jase.


519
0:45:29,916 --> 0:45:36,75
Which way's the bedroom?


520
0:45:36,75 --> 0:45:39,251
This one?


521
0:45:39,251 --> 0:45:42,126
Jason, can't we just
have a drink first?


522
0:45:42,126 --> 0:45:44,168
- Come on.
- Ow!


523
0:45:44,168 --> 0:45:46,85
Bring some in later.


524
0:45:46,85 --> 0:45:48,919
Billy! Billy!
Get him off me!


525
0:45:48,919 --> 0:45:54,669
don't be silly.


526
0:45:54,669 --> 0:45:57,92
Jason, please, why don't
we go out another night?
Why don't we go out tomorrow?


527
0:45:57,92 --> 0:46:1,42
don't play hard-to-get, babe.
don't like that game.


528
0:46:1,42 --> 0:46:3,754
But I don't want to.
I just wanna go home.


529
0:46:3,754 --> 0:46:6,87
Billy! Billy, help me!


530
0:46:6,87 --> 0:46:13,588
Help me!
Jason, stop!


531
0:46:13,588 --> 0:46:16,89
Get off me!


532
0:46:16,89 --> 0:46:19,922
Get off me! Billy!


533
0:46:19,922 --> 0:46:24,215
Please, Billy!


534
0:46:24,215 --> 0:46:29,299
Get off me!
Get off me!


535
0:46:29,299 --> 0:46:31,549
I don't want to!


536
0:46:31,549 --> 0:46:35,883
Get off me!


537
0:46:35,883 --> 0:46:39,92
No!


538
0:46:39,92 --> 0:46:40,967
No!


539
0:46:40,967 --> 0:46:45,592
Get of me!
You're hurting...


540
0:46:45,592 --> 0:46:51,968
No!


541
0:46:51,968 --> 0:46:58,802
Why didn't you
just say no, eh?


542
0:46:58,802 --> 0:47:6,262
Why'd you have to fuck
about being clever?


543
0:47:6,262 --> 0:47:8,762
Why didn't you just say no?


544
0:47:8,762 --> 0:48:4,352
Fucking about being clever.


545
0:48:4,352 --> 0:48:9,103
Suzy, wake up.


546
0:48:9,103 --> 0:48:16,895
Suzy, wake up.


547
0:48:16,895 --> 0:48:32,606
Suzy, wake up, babe.


548
0:48:32,606 --> 0:48:45,191
Fuck.


549
0:48:45,191 --> 0:48:49,4
Come on, open up. We're freezing.


550
0:48:49,4 --> 0:48:51,816
Just wait a sec!


551
0:48:51,816 --> 0:49:4,86
It's cold, isn't it?


552
0:49:4,86 --> 0:49:8,11
Hiya. What's happened?
Look at the state of ya.


553
0:49:8,11 --> 0:49:10,777
- You can't come in. I'm sorry.
- Why not?


554
0:49:10,777 --> 0:49:12,777
You just can't.


555
0:49:12,777 --> 0:49:15,653
Why not, Billy?


556
0:49:15,653 --> 0:49:17,778
-You got some one in there, haven'tyou?
-No.


557
0:49:17,778 --> 0:49:21,279
Yes, you have.
Who is it?


558
0:49:21,279 --> 0:49:24,29
Come on, Candy.


559
0:49:24,29 --> 0:49:26,446
- Sorry, Candy.
- Don't talk toher!


560
0:49:26,446 --> 0:49:34,322
Just go back inside
and leave us alone, all right?


561
0:49:34,322 --> 0:49:37,364
This is a fucking nightmare.


562
0:49:37,364 --> 0:49:39,239
Twenty kids in hospital,


563
0:49:39,239 --> 0:49:41,864
throwing up, hallucinating.


564
0:49:41,864 --> 0:49:44,448
I've never seen Spotty dogs before.
Must have been a bad batch.


565
0:49:44,448 --> 0:49:46,365
Bad? It's disastrous!


566
0:49:46,365 --> 0:49:50,324
-It makes us look like fuckin' amateurs.
-What about her?


567
0:49:50,324 --> 0:49:52,866
I don't know.
Think of something.


568
0:49:52,866 --> 0:49:55,74
You're the fucking driver.
Fucking drive her!


569
0:49:55,74 --> 0:49:56,95
Somewhere! Anywhere!
I don't care!


570
0:49:56,95 --> 0:50:12,952
Just get rid of it!
I don't wanna hear about it again!


571
0:50:12,952 --> 0:50:33,413
Hurry up, Billy.
It'll be light soon.


572
0:50:33,413 --> 0:50:36,121
It's moments like this
that either make you...


573
0:50:36,121 --> 0:50:38,496
or break you.


574
0:50:38,496 --> 0:50:41,789
Come on.


575
0:50:41,789 --> 0:50:48,289
Either you learn
to live with it...


576
0:50:48,289 --> 0:50:53,79
or you crack up.


577
0:50:53,79 --> 0:51:7,292
Now which one
is it going to be?


578
0:51:7,292 --> 0:51:11,959
Henry!


579
0:51:11,959 --> 0:51:35,92
Henry.


580
0:51:35,92 --> 0:51:42,421
All right, John?


581
0:51:42,421 --> 0:51:44,421
do you think
I'd try and stiff you?


582
0:51:44,421 --> 0:51:47,47
Do you think I'm mad?


583
0:51:47,47 --> 0:51:51,797
It was a bad batch.
There was nothing I could do.


584
0:51:51,797 --> 0:51:55,48
You know,
when I was inside,


585
0:51:55,48 --> 0:51:57,34
I heard this screaming one day.


586
0:51:57,34 --> 0:52:0,173
So I went to have a look,
and I found yke here...


587
0:52:0,173 --> 0:52:4,7
bent over the table with his trousers
round his ankles,


588
0:52:4,7 --> 0:52:8,841
four big, hairy paddies holding
him down, about to bugger him.


589
0:52:8,841 --> 0:52:19,717
Old Henry, he's off playing bingo.
Ain't that right, Henry?


590
0:52:19,717 --> 0:52:23,135
Please. Please, Jason,
don't do...


591
0:52:23,135 --> 0:52:27,468
don't do anything stupid.


592
0:52:27,468 --> 0:52:29,969
That was the first time
I met you, wasn't it?


593
0:52:29,969 --> 0:52:31,886
Well, in a little while,


594
0:52:31,886 --> 0:52:33,803
you're gonna be wishing I'd walk
straight past you that day...


595
0:52:33,803 --> 0:52:36,11
- and just let 'em get on with it.
- I'm sorry.


596
0:52:36,11 --> 0:52:46,304
I'm sorry, Jason.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.


597
0:52:46,304 --> 0:52:50,305
You've got 48 hours
to get me my money back...


598
0:52:50,305 --> 0:52:52,847
and the profit we lost.


599
0:52:52,847 --> 0:53:46,145
You fucking worm!


600
0:53:46,145 --> 0:53:48,395
What you gonna do about Lisa?


601
0:53:48,395 --> 0:53:51,312
Fuck all!


602
0:53:51,312 --> 0:53:55,354
- Hey, Billy Whizz, have you seen her?
- No.


603
0:53:55,354 --> 0:53:58,813
Where'd you take her then?
You drove her away.


604
0:53:58,813 --> 0:54:0,98
I brought her back here
and I went home.


605
0:54:0,98 --> 0:54:3,147
Leave her. She'll come back
with her tail between her legs,


606
0:54:3,147 --> 0:54:4,981
-likes he always does.
- What about that other business?


607
0:54:4,981 --> 0:54:9,148
- You sort that out as well?
- Yeah.


608
0:54:9,148 --> 0:54:11,856
- Where did you dump it?
- I sorted it out.


609
0:54:11,856 --> 0:54:15,732
That's all you need to know.


610
0:54:15,732 --> 0:54:18,482
- You ought to watch your fucking mouth.
- Leave him.


611
0:54:18,482 --> 0:54:21,941
- No! Fucking kid!
- Leave him, leave him. Come on.


612
0:54:21,941 --> 0:54:25,525
Billy, which one
do you want, eh?


613
0:54:25,525 --> 0:54:28,275
Huh? You can have
first choice,


614
0:54:28,275 --> 0:54:31,401
as long as it's not
the blond one.


615
0:54:31,401 --> 0:54:37,151
Um, I'll pass, thanks.


616
0:54:37,151 --> 0:54:41,652
Is it all right
if I see you lot later?


617
0:54:41,652 --> 0:54:44,986
Which one, Billy?
Where you going?


618
0:54:44,986 --> 0:54:48,278
I'm going home. I'm tired.


619
0:54:48,278 --> 0:54:51,278
- You're not leaving.
- Look, I've had enough. I want out.


620
0:54:51,278 --> 0:54:54,153
You don't want out on me,
you skinny, little prick!


621
0:54:54,153 --> 0:54:58,571
Now I said,
which one do you want, eh?


622
0:54:58,571 --> 0:55:1,154
This one? Eh?


623
0:55:1,154 --> 0:55:5,113
do you want this one,
or do you want this one, eh?


624
0:55:5,113 --> 0:55:8,947
No? Well, why not
do 'em both, eh?


625
0:55:8,947 --> 0:55:18,99
Now get in there and don't fucking
come out till you've done 'em!


626
0:55:18,99 --> 0:55:21,407
You know, I went to that place...
what's it called?


627
0:55:21,407 --> 0:55:24,241
Lakeside last week.


628
0:55:24,241 --> 0:55:27,324
I spent the whole afternoon
in a tea shop just watching.


629
0:55:27,324 --> 0:55:32,95
Something about the women
in that part of the world that
I find absolutely irresistible.


630
0:55:32,95 --> 0:55:37,659
Thought you were only
interested in Henry.


631
0:55:37,659 --> 0:55:41,326
No, they're fiercely pretty,
yet hard as nails,


632
0:55:41,326 --> 0:55:45,743
and it's a perfect combination.


633
0:55:45,743 --> 0:55:51,77
What I wouldn't give to have
my youth again in Essex.


634
0:55:51,77 --> 0:55:54,244
All I remember of my youth is getting
freezing cold under Southend Pier...


635
0:55:54,244 --> 0:55:58,37
with me knickers around me ankles.


636
0:55:58,37 --> 0:56:1,829
Well, I'll take you
under that pier again.


637
0:56:1,829 --> 0:56:8,913
You can haveyour knickers
around your ankles again.


638
0:56:8,913 --> 0:56:15,205
You know, I'm gonna
have to go back to him,
don'tyou?


639
0:56:15,205 --> 0:56:21,81
You know, I'm just about
to do something... really big.


640
0:56:21,81 --> 0:56:22,998
After that, I'll be able
to pay them of,


641
0:56:22,998 --> 0:56:25,79
and I'll still be
a very rich man.


642
0:56:25,79 --> 0:56:42,75
We could go somewhere
where he'd never find us.


643
0:56:42,75 --> 0:56:46,167
It's just a little investment. Spreading
out the old tentacles, youknow.


644
0:56:46,167 --> 0:56:48,126
Had bit of spare cash
laying about,


645
0:56:48,126 --> 0:56:52,71
and I fucking hate
waiting for cabs, so why not?


646
0:56:52,71 --> 0:56:55,377
- Perry.
- Oh, thanks, darling.


647
0:56:55,377 --> 0:56:58,169
-did you, uh, watch 'em make it?
- Yeah. Smoked salmon?


648
0:56:58,169 --> 0:57:1,669
Yeah, great.


649
0:57:1,669 --> 0:57:6,503
You know they gob in these things
in those places.


650
0:57:6,503 --> 0:57:9,295
So, what happened
to your face?


651
0:57:9,295 --> 0:57:12,171
Oh, I, I, uh...
I had some, um...


652
0:57:12,171 --> 0:57:15,629
- I had some problems the other night.
- Uh-huh.


653
0:57:15,629 --> 0:57:18,713
- So speak to me.
- Well, I just wanted
to talk about the drop,


654
0:57:18,713 --> 0:57:20,672
make sure everything's
going to plan.


655
0:57:20,672 --> 0:57:24,589
Oh, yeah. Everything's
still going to plan, John,


656
0:57:24,589 --> 0:57:26,673
except for one small detail.


657
0:57:26,673 --> 0:57:30,34
You're no longer
part of that plan.


658
0:57:30,34 --> 0:57:33,173
What's the matter?
You think I don't know about things?


659
0:57:33,173 --> 0:57:35,924
Perry, I need this job.
We've been friends for a long time.


660
0:57:35,924 --> 0:57:37,841
Are you taking me
for a cunt, John?


661
0:57:37,841 --> 0:57:40,674
Perry, that was a one-off.


662
0:57:40,674 --> 0:57:43,258
John, are you
taking me for a cunt?


663
0:57:43,258 --> 0:57:46,175
- It's a very simple little question.
- No. No, of course not.


664
0:57:46,175 --> 0:57:51,51
Well, listen. Take my advice
and fuck off right now...


665
0:57:51,51 --> 0:57:53,468
before I lose my temper,
all right?


666
0:57:53,468 --> 0:57:58,218
Perry, you...
you can't just cut me out.


667
0:57:58,218 --> 0:58:1,302
Can't? Can't?


668
0:58:1,302 --> 0:58:3,594
You just watch me.


669
0:58:3,594 --> 0:58:7,678
The minute that you do business
with those fuckers, you become dirty.


670
0:58:7,678 --> 0:58:9,845
I can no longer trust you.


671
0:58:9,845 --> 0:58:14,12
So now... you're gone.


672
0:58:14,12 --> 0:58:17,596
Fuck off.


673
0:58:17,596 --> 0:58:25,138
Nothing personal, John.


674
0:58:25,138 --> 0:58:28,222
I haven't got your money.


675
0:58:28,222 --> 0:58:30,18
But I've got something better,
a new proposition.


676
0:58:30,18 --> 0:58:32,181
Something that will be
worth much more.


677
0:58:32,181 --> 0:58:34,181
-It'll make you a million each. Minimum.
-Come on, Jason.


678
0:58:34,181 --> 0:58:37,431
Let's listen to what he's gotta say.


679
0:58:37,431 --> 0:58:40,557
Perry Elley is flying in
a consignment of coke.


680
0:58:40,557 --> 0:58:42,599
- A big one.
- Mm-hmm.


681
0:58:42,599 --> 0:58:45,807
I know when and where
the drop is going to be made.


682
0:58:45,807 --> 0:58:50,35
I can put you in the right place
at the right time to hit the courier.


683
0:58:50,35 --> 0:58:53,892
We divide the consignment
into four,


684
0:58:53,892 --> 0:58:57,642
and that's a million a piece.


685
0:58:57,642 --> 0:58:59,517
And we get to whack
Perry Elley.


686
0:58:59,517 --> 0:59:1,476
It's perfect.


687
0:59:1,476 --> 0:59:3,351
There are two stipulations.


688
0:59:3,351 --> 0:59:6,31
Stipulations?
Like what?


689
0:59:6,31 --> 0:59:12,61
First, this wipes the slate clean.


690
0:59:12,61 --> 0:59:15,644
And?


691
0:59:15,644 --> 0:59:30,688
And we never cross
each other's paths again.


692
0:59:30,688 --> 1:0:1,442
Why not? Who wants
to see you again anyway?


693
1:0:1,442 --> 1:0:4,26
So, now they're all in it together.


694
1:0:4,26 --> 1:1:4,991
A nice little
jolly boys outing.


695
1:1:4,991 --> 1:1:21,91
Well, we're gonna need
a four-wheel drive, ain't we?


696
1:1:21,91 --> 1:1:25,36
The plane will come in
over the top of those trees,


697
1:1:25,36 --> 1:1:28,744
and the pilot will probably set it down
in that stretch of field over there.


698
1:1:28,744 --> 1:1:32,328
They have runway lights
that flick on at the last moment.


699
1:1:32,328 --> 1:1:35,37
Oh, yeah? Well, what if it's
raining then, like tonight?


700
1:1:35,37 --> 1:1:38,579
Shouldn't make any difference.


701
1:1:38,579 --> 1:1:43,871
Well, we can hole up over there
for a couple of hours
before they make the drop.


702
1:1:43,871 --> 1:1:48,372
Yeah. Get here nice and early.


703
1:1:48,372 --> 1:1:51,789
And then boom, boom,
fucking boom.


704
1:1:51,789 --> 1:1:54,914
Take out
the reception committee...


705
1:1:54,914 --> 1:1:57,248
and the courier.


706
1:1:57,248 --> 1:2:2,165
We'll need automatic weapons
and night sights.


707
1:2:2,165 --> 1:2:8,208
Yeah, we can do this.


708
1:2:8,208 --> 1:2:11,875
- When then?
- Oh.


709
1:2:11,875 --> 1:2:14,42
Soon.


710
1:2:14,42 --> 1:2:17,626
Look, I've, uh... I got the keys
to the, uh, to the gate here.


711
1:2:17,626 --> 1:2:19,542
You won't want me around,
will you?


712
1:2:19,542 --> 1:2:21,459
It's not my scene, really.


713
1:2:21,459 --> 1:2:25,377
What's the matter,
ykey? Squeamish?


714
1:2:25,377 --> 1:2:29,835
This is a field.
This is where worms belong.


715
1:2:29,835 --> 1:2:33,378
I wouldn't let you miss this,
not for the world.


716
1:2:33,378 --> 1:2:48,213
That goes for you too,
Billy Whizz.


717
1:2:48,213 --> 1:2:51,38
Who wants to be a millionaire


718
1:2:51,38 --> 1:2:55,88
We do


719
1:2:55,88 --> 1:2:59,339
Who wants to be a millionaire
We do


720
1:2:59,339 --> 1:3:1,964
There's no way we're gonna chuck
it all away, not what we've got.


721
1:3:1,964 --> 1:3:5,48
- Good.
- Yeah. I mean, we're really great together.


722
1:3:5,48 --> 1:3:10,674
Get us another bottle, will you, babe?


723
1:3:10,674 --> 1:3:13,883
Come here.


724
1:3:13,883 --> 1:3:16,91
You know, we've
discovered the secret...


725
1:3:16,91 --> 1:3:18,883
to a happy relationship,
haven't we, Lisa?


726
1:3:18,883 --> 1:3:23,384
I do what I want,
and she does what I tell her.


727
1:3:23,384 --> 1:3:25,384
That's what works for us.


728
1:3:25,384 --> 1:3:29,176
And a back hander every now and then.


729
1:3:29,176 --> 1:3:32,968
Only it's important to have a secret
when they get to this age, you know.


730
1:3:32,968 --> 1:3:37,177
Once they get past 30,
they start getting saggy, you know?


731
1:3:37,177 --> 1:3:43,22
imples in their arses,
eh, Lisa?


732
1:3:43,22 --> 1:3:47,345
And their tits
start to hang down.


733
1:3:47,345 --> 1:3:56,805
And they still wear frilly underwear,
but it don'tlook very nice, no.


734
1:3:56,805 --> 1:4:1,389
But I tell you, they're still handy
for carrying and fetching.


735
1:4:1,389 --> 1:4:4,472
Now go on, get some glasses.


736
1:4:4,472 --> 1:4:22,141
Billy Whizz, give her a hand.


737
1:4:22,141 --> 1:4:24,225
He's a fucking arsehole.


738
1:4:24,225 --> 1:4:27,225
Forget it.
I can handle him.


739
1:4:27,225 --> 1:4:30,559
When this all comes off, perhaps
you should bury the hatchet with yke.


740
1:4:30,559 --> 1:4:36,143
- He could be useful.
- Oh, I'll bury it in his fucking head.


741
1:4:36,143 --> 1:4:39,518
Look, I've made up me mind.


742
1:4:39,518 --> 1:4:42,352
We hit yke
and have his share between us.


743
1:4:42,352 --> 1:4:45,894
About the other night,
I'm really sorry for what I said.


744
1:4:45,894 --> 1:4:48,19
I was hurt, and when
I'm hurt, I lash out.


745
1:4:48,19 --> 1:4:50,811
You just happened
to be in the way.


746
1:4:50,811 --> 1:4:54,228
- Are we still friends?
- Yeah, no problem.


747
1:4:54,228 --> 1:5:0,146
What about Billy Whizz?
Can we trust him?


748
1:5:0,146 --> 1:5:56,28
No. Better do him and all.


749
1:5:56,28 --> 1:6:21,239
Evening, Billy.


750
1:6:21,239 --> 1:6:24,906
How many of them
will there be?


751
1:6:24,906 --> 1:6:29,782
About three or four,
I should think.


752
1:6:29,782 --> 1:6:37,908
They'll all have to
be taken out.


753
1:6:37,908 --> 1:7:8,495
Fucking hell.


754
1:7:8,495 --> 1:7:13,246
Wish me luck.


755
1:7:13,246 --> 1:7:26,664
All right, Billy Whizz!
You wanker!


756
1:7:26,664 --> 1:7:29,331
Heckler & Koch MP5.


757
1:7:29,331 --> 1:7:31,957
Fires a standard
9mm Parabellum round.


758
1:7:31,957 --> 1:7:35,82
Thirty rounds a magazine, eight hundred
rounds a minute on full auto.


759
1:7:35,82 --> 1:7:38,291
Fucking quality.


760
1:7:38,291 --> 1:7:40,708
We couldn't get
the night sights,


761
1:7:40,708 --> 1:7:44,125
so we're just gonna have
to get in close, eh?


762
1:7:44,125 --> 1:7:46,83
Shall we go?


763
1:7:46,83 --> 1:7:56,418
What's up, Mr. Worm?


764
1:7:56,418 --> 1:7:58,793
Who wants to be a millionaire


765
1:7:58,793 --> 1:8:0,752
We do, we do


766
1:8:0,752 --> 1:8:2,669
- Who do?
- We do!


767
1:8:2,669 --> 1:9:10,177
Yeah!


768
1:9:10,177 --> 1:9:40,723
I'll get the gate, shall I?


769
1:9:40,723 --> 1:9:50,265
Boom.


770
1:9:50,265 --> 1:9:52,266
Hello.


771
1:9:52,266 --> 1:9:57,1
Where are you?
You sound funny.


772
1:9:57,1 --> 1:10:28,27
Yeah? Yeah,
get a couple of bottles.


773
1:10:28,27 --> 1:10:30,104
Shut up, Billy!


774
1:10:30,104 --> 1:10:32,21
There's no need
for this, John.


775
1:10:32,21 --> 1:10:33,938
You can keep it all.


776
1:10:33,938 --> 1:10:37,605
Oh, Jason,
you foolish, greedy boy.


777
1:10:37,605 --> 1:10:40,605
There are no drugs.


778
1:10:40,605 --> 1:10:42,689
There is noplane.


779
1:10:42,689 --> 1:10:47,564
You want to mess with me?
You're not in the same league.


780
1:10:47,564 --> 1:10:49,648
I thought we were mates.


781
1:10:49,648 --> 1:10:51,606
I looked after you in prison.


782
1:10:51,606 --> 1:10:53,857
I'm a man of honor, Jason.
I always pay my debts.


783
1:10:53,857 --> 1:10:56,315
Please.


784
1:10:56,315 --> 1:10:58,357
This is silly.


785
1:10:58,357 --> 1:11:2,441
Billy, you said you wanted to know
how far this was going to take you.


786
1:11:2,441 --> 1:11:18,61
- No! don't!
- Hold it, John.


787
1:11:18,61 --> 1:11:20,61
- Leave him, Henry.
- He's a witness.


788
1:11:20,61 --> 1:11:24,611
I'm not having this little bastard
hanging over me.


789
1:11:24,611 --> 1:11:32,778
No, no, no.
Leave him alone, Henry.


790
1:11:32,778 --> 1:12:4,907
That's enough for tonight.


791
1:12:4,907 --> 1:12:8,741
Who wants to be a millionaire


792
1:12:8,741 --> 1:13:32,793
They don't


793
1:13:32,793 --> 1:13:36,46
Hello, Billy.
Yeah, come in.


794
1:13:36,46 --> 1:13:38,502
You can listen to this.


795
1:13:38,502 --> 1:13:40,461
Obviously,
if you don't mind, Lisa.


796
1:13:40,461 --> 1:13:42,419
I had no idea where
Jason was going that night.


797
1:13:42,419 --> 1:13:45,42
Yeah, but... That's weird though, isn't
it? It's not very romantic, is it?


798
1:13:45,42 --> 1:13:49,129
He'd been out of prison for,
what, two weeks?


799
1:13:49,129 --> 1:13:53,921
I mean, he's hanging out with
all sorts of strange people,
leaving you here home alone.


800
1:13:53,921 --> 1:13:55,88
Don't know who he's with,
where he is.


801
1:13:55,88 --> 1:14:1,797
My husband fucked around.
Is that what you want to hear?


802
1:14:1,797 --> 1:14:4,714
- You ever heard of Suzy Welch?
- Who?


803
1:14:4,714 --> 1:14:8,214
Suzy Welch. Young girl.


804
1:14:8,214 --> 1:14:12,215
Very pretty.


805
1:14:12,215 --> 1:14:16,9
on't know whether your husband
associated with her in the last
couple of weeks, do you?


806
1:14:16,9 --> 1:14:18,132
It's possible.


807
1:14:18,132 --> 1:14:20,633
If she had a cute arse,
it's certainly possible.


808
1:14:20,633 --> 1:14:24,3
Hmm. She disappeared.


809
1:14:24,3 --> 1:14:26,3
And you think Jason's death
may have something to do with it?


810
1:14:26,3 --> 1:14:28,5
Some one killed him
because of her?


811
1:14:28,5 --> 1:14:29,967
Thanks. Makes me feel really great.


812
1:14:29,967 --> 1:14:32,342
Oh. I've upset you now, ain't I?


813
1:14:32,342 --> 1:14:35,968
I didn't mean to do that.


814
1:14:35,968 --> 1:14:39,552
All right.
I'll leavey ou here.


815
1:14:39,552 --> 1:14:42,469
Leave you two in your grief.


816
1:14:42,469 --> 1:14:46,636
Billy.


817
1:14:46,636 --> 1:14:48,553
Used to drive for Jason,
didn't you?


818
1:14:48,553 --> 1:14:51,845
Yeah, now and again,
but not that night, obviously.


819
1:14:51,845 --> 1:14:55,762
Obviously.


820
1:14:55,762 --> 1:15:25,391
I'll be in touch.


821
1:15:25,391 --> 1:15:28,641
You didn't think I'd go through
with it, did you? Admit it.


822
1:15:28,641 --> 1:15:31,766
No.


823
1:15:31,766 --> 1:15:34,308
I did it for you.


824
1:15:34,308 --> 1:15:38,309
Where have you been?
I've been waiting for two hours.


825
1:15:38,309 --> 1:15:40,226
I've had the police around.


826
1:15:40,226 --> 1:15:44,226
- I'm sorry.
- It worries me how much they know.


827
1:15:44,226 --> 1:15:46,143
Oh, what can they know?
They know nothing.


828
1:15:46,143 --> 1:15:49,435
The only people who can
tell them anything... can't speak.


829
1:15:49,435 --> 1:15:53,228
Billy can. They know
he drove for Jason.


830
1:15:53,228 --> 1:15:55,644
No. Billy's all right.
on't worry about Billy.


831
1:15:55,644 --> 1:15:57,561
You sure you can trust him?


832
1:15:57,561 --> 1:16:1,77
No. He's too scared
to say anything.


833
1:16:1,77 --> 1:16:3,687
So, how are you?


834
1:16:3,687 --> 1:16:6,271
Is the burden of knowledge
weighing you down?


835
1:16:6,271 --> 1:16:8,313
No. I'm fine.


836
1:16:8,313 --> 1:16:10,521
It's like I told you, Billy.


837
1:16:10,521 --> 1:16:15,105
It's moments like this
that will make you...


838
1:16:15,105 --> 1:16:17,689
or break you.


839
1:16:17,689 --> 1:16:20,23
Have the police been to see you?


840
1:16:20,23 --> 1:16:22,815
Yeah. There was a smart arse
Old Bill around Lisa's.


841
1:16:22,815 --> 1:16:24,815
- What did he ask you?
- Nothing.


842
1:16:24,815 --> 1:16:27,107
- He just give me his card
and said he'd get in touch.
- Good.


843
1:16:27,107 --> 1:16:29,315
We must expect this, Billy.
It's perfectly normal.


844
1:16:29,315 --> 1:16:31,399
They'll be questioning
all his associates.


845
1:16:31,399 --> 1:16:33,191
I'm sure they'll be
talking to me at some point.


846
1:16:33,191 --> 1:16:37,483
The situation
is very simple, Billy.


847
1:16:37,483 --> 1:16:39,692
The only people who
know what happened...


848
1:16:39,692 --> 1:16:43,4
are you, me and Henry.


849
1:16:43,4 --> 1:16:45,942
The other people who knew...


850
1:16:45,942 --> 1:16:48,68
are, of course, dead.


851
1:16:48,68 --> 1:16:50,735
Mr... you know, I...
I, like...


852
1:16:50,735 --> 1:16:55,902
I wouldn't say a word
about this to anyone.


853
1:16:55,902 --> 1:17:0,69
Look. All this work
for a drainage trench.


854
1:17:0,69 --> 1:17:6,737
Can you believe how obsessed
Henry gets about this garden?


855
1:17:6,737 --> 1:17:10,445
I'm bringing a shipment in
this week.


856
1:17:10,445 --> 1:17:13,779
I wanted to make sure
I could rely on you.


857
1:17:13,779 --> 1:17:15,696
Y-Yeah, ofcourse.
Nothing's changed.


858
1:17:15,696 --> 1:17:19,72
Now tell me, how's Lisa?
I haven't seen her for awhile.


859
1:17:19,72 --> 1:17:23,322
Uh, she's a bit upset.


860
1:17:23,322 --> 1:17:27,489
I want you to, uh,
look after her a bit.


861
1:17:27,489 --> 1:17:32,198
drive her around, make sure
she doesn't come to any harm.


862
1:17:32,198 --> 1:17:45,158
I'm worried about her.


863
1:17:45,158 --> 1:17:47,658
I'm taking over
the business, Beverley.


864
1:17:47,658 --> 1:17:49,575
- I want the books.
- Go fuck yourself.


865
1:17:49,575 --> 1:17:51,867
Lend me one of your vibrators,
and I will.


866
1:17:51,867 --> 1:17:53,951
Which one's been your favorite
since Peter got splattered?


867
1:17:53,951 --> 1:17:55,576
You bitch!


868
1:17:55,576 --> 1:17:58,243
Fucking try that again,
I'll fucking do you!


869
1:17:58,243 --> 1:18:3,77
What gives you the right to think you
can just come in here and take over?


870
1:18:3,77 --> 1:18:6,411
'Cause who's gonna stop me?
You, Beverley?


871
1:18:6,411 --> 1:18:9,119
don't make me laugh.
Look at you.


872
1:18:9,119 --> 1:18:11,786
This place. This stuff.


873
1:18:11,786 --> 1:18:14,162
You got your drinks trolley,
chandelier, piano.


874
1:18:14,162 --> 1:18:16,495
Can you even play
the piano, Beverley?


875
1:18:16,495 --> 1:18:19,162
And how'd you get all of this, eh?
Of of Jason's back.


876
1:18:19,162 --> 1:18:22,413
- That's how.
- You're the one's who's
got everything on your back.


877
1:18:22,413 --> 1:18:25,663
don't annoy me, Beverley. The terms
are getting worse all the time.


878
1:18:25,663 --> 1:18:27,914
Now, you can keep
this house and the cars.


879
1:18:27,914 --> 1:18:30,497
I'm taking over the doors.
If you have a problem with that,


880
1:18:30,497 --> 1:18:33,248
you can have a chat with Kiri Christos
about the money you owe him.


881
1:18:33,248 --> 1:18:36,206
What am I supposed to live on?


882
1:18:36,206 --> 1:18:38,707
Yeah.


883
1:18:38,707 --> 1:18:47,416
I've been thinking about that.


884
1:18:47,416 --> 1:18:49,833
250 quid a week.


885
1:18:49,833 --> 1:18:54,667
Remember? That's what Peter
was paying me when Jason was inside.


886
1:18:54,667 --> 1:18:57,876
That's when he wasn't trying
to get inside my knickers.


887
1:18:57,876 --> 1:19:41,173
Fair's fair, eh, Beverley?


888
1:19:41,173 --> 1:20:35,679
Where now?


889
1:20:35,679 --> 1:20:39,847
I keep turning it
over and over in my mind.


890
1:20:39,847 --> 1:20:42,97
I must have been speaking to him
just before he died.


891
1:20:42,97 --> 1:20:46,347
Yeah?


892
1:20:46,347 --> 1:20:50,265
- Where were you, Billy?
- Me? I was at home watching the telly.


893
1:20:50,265 --> 1:20:52,182
Well, I knew they were
planning something.


894
1:20:52,182 --> 1:20:54,348
Why didn't they
want you to drive 'em?


895
1:20:54,348 --> 1:20:56,515
don't know. They were all
very secretive about it.


896
1:20:56,515 --> 1:21:1,724
- You wouldn't lie to me,
would you, Billy?
- I weren't there.


897
1:21:1,724 --> 1:21:3,683
So, who do you think done it?


898
1:21:3,683 --> 1:21:6,642
don't know. Perry Elley?


899
1:21:6,642 --> 1:21:9,184
What about John yke? do you think he
could have had anything to do with it?


900
1:21:9,184 --> 1:21:15,768
No. Mr...? No.
Why, do you?


901
1:21:15,768 --> 1:21:17,685
I don't know.


902
1:21:17,685 --> 1:22:9,858
There's just something about him
that's not quite right.


903
1:22:9,858 --> 1:22:13,15
Lisa, there's...


904
1:22:13,15 --> 1:22:15,692
- there's something I gotta tell ya.
- What?


905
1:22:15,692 --> 1:22:18,67
It's been playing on my mind.


906
1:22:18,67 --> 1:22:20,234
What has?


907
1:22:20,234 --> 1:22:22,943
It's about Jason.


908
1:22:22,943 --> 1:22:24,985
And just, like...


909
1:22:24,985 --> 1:22:30,861
The way he died.


910
1:22:30,861 --> 1:22:34,986
How did he die, Billy?


911
1:22:34,986 --> 1:22:36,903
I just...


912
1:22:36,903 --> 1:22:48,238
I just keep thinking it... it's
gonna happen to you and me.


913
1:22:48,238 --> 1:22:52,405
- Hello?
- Billy, the groceries are ready.


914
1:22:52,405 --> 1:22:55,864
Oh, right, yeah.
Um, I'll be there as soon as I can.


915
1:22:55,864 --> 1:22:59,406
- Where are you?
- I'm at home. I'm on me way.


916
1:22:59,406 --> 1:23:1,364
Where's Lisa?


917
1:23:1,364 --> 1:23:4,865
I, uh, I... I... She went shopping.
I dropped her off.


918
1:23:4,865 --> 1:24:44,711
Okay. Be as quick as you can.


919
1:24:44,711 --> 1:24:48,919
Yeah, you fuck.


920
1:24:48,919 --> 1:27:3,52
Fuck.


921
1:27:3,52 --> 1:27:7,728
I had high hopes of you, Billy.


922
1:27:7,728 --> 1:27:10,354
Thought you had brains.


923
1:27:10,354 --> 1:27:13,688
Not like those other animals.


924
1:27:13,688 --> 1:27:18,146
I was prepared to help you.


925
1:27:18,146 --> 1:27:23,22
I knew you'd make mistakes.


926
1:27:23,22 --> 1:27:27,731
Then you went too far.


927
1:27:27,731 --> 1:27:31,65
She belongs to me, Billy.


928
1:27:31,65 --> 1:28:5,152
I don't want you to touch her!


929
1:28:5,152 --> 1:28:8,653
You wanted to know
where this would take you.


930
1:28:8,653 --> 1:29:36,747
Billy, it ends here!


931
1:29:36,747 --> 1:30:3,42
You fucker!


932
1:30:3,42 --> 1:30:6,876
Lisa, it's me. They just fucking
shot me. I can't believe this shit.


933
1:30:6,876 --> 1:30:9,418
- Are you okay?
- No, I fuckin' ain't okay!


934
1:30:9,418 --> 1:30:12,502
They just tried to kill me! Why didn't
you tell me about you and yke?


935
1:30:12,502 --> 1:30:15,44
- What the fuck's going on?
- Listen, it's a little difficult.


936
1:30:15,44 --> 1:30:17,586
Little difficult?
Well, I'll tell you something, Lisa.


937
1:30:17,586 --> 1:30:19,502
They fucking killed Jason.


938
1:30:19,502 --> 1:30:21,378
Okay. Can you drive?


939
1:30:21,378 --> 1:30:24,42
did you hear what I just said?
They killed Jason, Lisa.


940
1:30:24,42 --> 1:30:26,42
- I fucking saw them.
- I can't talk right now.


941
1:30:26,42 --> 1:30:28,462
- Can you drive?
- Yeah, I can drive.


942
1:30:28,462 --> 1:30:31,421
- Okay. I'll meet you at number six.
- Number six? The motel?


943
1:30:31,421 --> 1:30:33,379
- Yeah, that's right.
- You will be there?


944
1:30:33,379 --> 1:30:35,254
Yeah, I'll be there.


945
1:30:35,254 --> 1:30:39,255
don't fuck me up, Lisa.
I need you.


946
1:30:39,255 --> 1:30:42,714
I'm really sorry, Perry.
Something's come up.


947
1:30:42,714 --> 1:30:46,381
It's girl stuff.
Can we continue this later?


948
1:30:46,381 --> 1:30:50,256
Oh, that's a shame. do you know
they make these with fresh fruit?


949
1:30:50,256 --> 1:30:52,34
Tell you what.


950
1:30:52,34 --> 1:31:14,176
You can have my cherry.


951
1:31:14,176 --> 1:31:17,93
We can't stay here 'cause
he'll come here. He'll find us.


952
1:31:17,93 --> 1:31:19,218
It's all right, it's all right.
We're safe for the time being.


953
1:31:19,218 --> 1:31:22,51
- Let's get you out of this.
- It fucking hurts.


954
1:31:22,51 --> 1:31:31,762
It's okay. We've gotta get you
cleaned up, get you in the bath.


955
1:31:31,762 --> 1:31:33,762
Why didn't you tell me
about you and him?


956
1:31:33,762 --> 1:31:35,72
There's nothing to tell.


957
1:31:35,72 --> 1:31:37,637
He's got some sort of
obsession with me, that's all.


958
1:31:37,637 --> 1:31:40,138
Just got out of hand.


959
1:31:40,138 --> 1:31:45,888
Well, he's just tried to fucking
kill me. He nearly did and all.


960
1:31:45,888 --> 1:31:48,639
- He'll kill you too.
- Let's deal with
one problem at a time, eh?


961
1:31:48,639 --> 1:31:55,98
What have you done here?


962
1:31:55,98 --> 1:31:57,515
Well, we got them "E's" next door.


963
1:31:57,515 --> 1:32:0,473
We can sell them two bags of pills
and just get out of here.


964
1:32:0,473 --> 1:32:2,515
What do you think?


965
1:32:2,515 --> 1:32:5,932
I'm gonna need some antiseptic,
some tweezers and a dressing.
What's the time?


966
1:32:5,932 --> 1:32:8,516
Look, I'm gonna find
a late night chemist.


967
1:32:8,516 --> 1:32:10,433
I'll take your clothes
to the laundry too.


968
1:32:10,433 --> 1:32:12,892
We can't have you checking out
covered in mud.


969
1:32:12,892 --> 1:32:14,809
Come on, drink up.


970
1:32:14,809 --> 1:32:18,101
What do you think?


971
1:32:18,101 --> 1:32:24,435
I think it's a really good idea, Billy.
Just you and me together.


972
1:32:24,435 --> 1:32:26,727
Well, don't be too long.


973
1:32:26,727 --> 1:33:7,94
I won't.


974
1:33:7,94 --> 1:33:10,649
Where are you?


975
1:33:10,649 --> 1:33:14,108
don't know.
You sound funny.


976
1:33:14,108 --> 1:33:37,611
Good-bye, Jason.


977
1:33:37,611 --> 1:33:50,362
- Hello.
- Good-bye, Billy.


978
1:33:50,362 --> 1:33:52,279
John, you don't
have to do this!


979
1:33:52,279 --> 1:33:54,238
I didn't know nothing
about you and her!


980
1:33:54,238 --> 1:33:56,905
I swear to God!
I wouldn't have happened if I had.


981
1:33:56,905 --> 1:33:58,988
John, John, here's the gear.


982
1:33:58,988 --> 1:34:1,364
Look!


983
1:34:1,364 --> 1:34:7,739
I'm not gonna keep it.
You have it.


984
1:34:7,739 --> 1:34:9,865
I'll go away, John,
and I'll never come back!


985
1:34:9,865 --> 1:34:11,782
You'll never see me again!


986
1:34:11,782 --> 1:34:20,449
John, I won't say a fucking word!
I'll disappear!


987
1:34:20,449 --> 1:34:23,75
We are the police! We are armed!


988
1:34:23,75 --> 1:34:38,493
Come out of the cabin
with your arms up in the air!


989
1:34:38,493 --> 1:34:42,494
Come out of the cabin.


990
1:34:42,494 --> 1:34:46,744
Walk forward.
Walk forward!


991
1:34:46,744 --> 1:34:49,495
Get down on your knees.


992
1:34:49,495 --> 1:34:56,37
Face down. Face down!


993
1:34:56,37 --> 1:35:1,496
Now spread your legs.


994
1:35:1,496 --> 1:35:4,996
It was... very funny.


995
1:35:4,996 --> 1:35:6,913
It was hilarious.


996
1:35:6,913 --> 1:35:11,39
I mean, Mr. D. 's gonna kill Lisa,
and I've become a liability.


997
1:35:11,39 --> 1:35:13,248
And now she's rubbing noses
with Perry Elley.


998
1:35:13,248 --> 1:35:16,998
- She needs both of us out ofher life.
- Hello, Billy Whizz.


999
1:35:16,998 --> 1:35:19,707
So, the Old Bill
gets ananonymous tip,


1000
1:35:19,707 --> 1:35:22,415
and they catch this fella
red-handed...


1001
1:35:22,415 --> 1:35:27,458
in a Southend motel room
with 50 grand's worth of pills.


1002
1:35:27,458 --> 1:35:30,291
This fella's looking at
ten years inside, easy,


1003
1:35:30,291 --> 1:35:32,208
unless he can make a trade.


1004
1:35:32,208 --> 1:35:38,542
Turns outhe's only the witness
to a shocking triple murder.


1005
1:35:38,542 --> 1:35:40,501
Essex boys?


1006
1:35:40,501 --> 1:37:40,501
She done the lot of us.
