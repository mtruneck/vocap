###2 To a working system, that’s beneficial to most people. Now you can be so aberrated that
###9 you can’t see the benefits of the system. Can you understand that? You can be - it’s
###16 like the Jews going to the Nazis for free money to expand Jewish knowledge. Now, you
###23 know what a real, in the old days, liberal  - a liberal can’t go to a clan meeting
###29 and say “you guys are ridiculous” he can talk to them, but he can’t talk to them,
###36 he’ll talk at them. They won’t hear a word he says, because they listen as a clans
###44 man with those tools. Is man a reasoning animal? He can’t be because he couldn’t change
###51 then. If he’s subject to change then he can’t have a fixed set of values, you know
###59 what that means? These are very tough things, you have to think about them a lot, toss them
###65 around, meaning, listen to normal people, see if there’s any signal in what they say.
###72 Except “I like being with you” that means, they’re not dissatisfied. But you must provide
###82 tools and to tell people that they need tools, they take as an insult “who the hell are
###93 you to tell me what I need?” You understand? The ego becomes involved because they think
###100 you’re downing them. You know what that means? You’re not downing them, you’re
###105 trying to equip them, with better tools. There’s a glass cleaner that’s available called
###114 ‘transparent glass’ are you familiar with it? You rub it on your windshield and you
###119 can’t see the glass. It deflects light in such a way that the glass looks like there’s
###127 no glass there. It’s called transparent fluid, which they use on optics now on cameras.
###134 But it’s temporary, it then fogs up a little. But anyway, with the advent of science and
###143 technology say assume we don’t kill each other we live another thousand years, the
###148 average person, it’s not just a laptop but it’s what it does that’s - you can turn
###157 pages of a book you can move it with your fingers, it’s doing so many new things which
###163 invite thousands of other new things especially if people are in the business of making new
###169 things. So the exponential curve will go very sharp leaving people behind continuously,
###177 that’s why an IQ test has nothing to do with anything except your responses in relation
###187 to a fixed set of conditions. IQ does not measure intelligence. You may have neurons,
###198 neurotransmitters more than the other person has and you might remember more but that doesn’t
###205 make you better. If you’re a specialist say psychologist and you study human behavior
###213 how can you study human behavior without studying the monetary system? You know what I mean?
###223 So you tell ‘em to give a little, she’ll give a little, you know? Shit like that. Gotta
###247 get a drink. If you know psychologists or a neurologist, you ask ’em what does their
###257 profession do? Well, it tries to adjust people so they can respond to the culture, that would
###261 be insane. Do you know what I mean? Do you know what I’m talking about? A psychologist
###273 would have to ask other questions “what is it I want? What is it that I want? I want
###279 a flexibility in human behavior” but a flexibility that doesn’t bring any money in might make
###291 the person a hobo. You know what I mean? Normal people have ideas of well adjusted person,
###300 a well adjusted Indian is a well adjusted Indian, a well adjusted Mexican is a well
###308 adjusted Mexican, but there’s no such thing as well adjusted people. Do you know what
###315 that means? So trying to be well adjusted is updating your tools. Well adjusted to change.
###323 Yeah. If you know what that means. So, the problems become more difficult with this system
###334 to change people, they don’t even know they need change. I think when the laptop came
###344 out you had to show people what it does, they didn’t just sit there and do it. When something
###352 new comes out they show you what it does and they say “oh these are new tools” so.
###364 Now if a guy lives in the south seas learning celestial mechanics or high level mathematics,
###375 there’s no use for it out there if he’s a native. That’s information superfluous
###383 to his needs. You know what that means? If you teach a native - primitive person, biological
###391 systems, it might be superfluous to his lifestyle there, you know what that means? Ok. I would
###400 imagine that if there is such a thing as advanced people out in the universe I don’t believe
###409 they would communicate with us. I don’t believe they would even try. I don’t believe
###415 they’d have “well let’s give ‘em a hand” I don’t think they’d think that
###421 way. It’s like you and ants, you know what I mean? Humans think that they would welcome
###428 a new civilisation. so you don’t think we’d be of interest. I don’t think so, how could
###437 we be of interest? We can’t say anything new, especially if they land in the south
###445 specific and they meet the natives and the natives say “the volcanoes angry” what
###451 can they do with that? They can leave the area or, I don’t even think they’d know,
###459 they’d know the guy has primitive associations, and they wouldn’t have to ask him anything
###464 alls they have to do is watch our TV shows, which they watch for 2 seconds, “what a
###470 bunch of shit” I don’t think they’d say that but, it’s very hard - people say
###480 to me “will people be happier in the future?” they’re using today's standards with the
###486 future. It isn’t happiness that people need, it’s security and evaluation of the real
###493 world, that brings equilibrium, and to the extent that your notions about the world are
###500 unreal, you will suffer. I would say, I think you told me that your father used to beat
###509 your mother, that was the best tools he had, getting mad at him does not give him new tools
###517 and when he doesn’t say “what do you think I ought to do?” that would be rare, I don’t
###523 think he’d ever say that to you, would he? “What do you think I ought to do?” He
###538 doesn’t even have that in his head. I gave him that opportunity one time and he rejected
###539  - I didn’t speak to him in 2 years. Yeah, but that’s because you believe that people
###542 can think and reason, only if you give them the tools, that takes time for the tools to
###549 gel too. You just can’t hand people tools they won’t even know what it is. You know
###558 what a stage is on a microscope? You can move the film minuet quantities of distance that
###566 you’re looking at the specimen can be turned to the right, where you have to turn it 50
###570 times to move it 1000th of an inch. So if you’re looking at bacteria that’s extensional,
###578 so again, all extensional devices change, that’s why you can never become sane. You
###585 can never become well adjusted, you know what I mean? If all things keep changing how can
###593 you become sane? And sane means, you’re sane, that can’t be, because there’s so
###600 much we don’t know, we can become saner, but never sane. Do you know what that means?
###606 You mean define sane? what’s that? Can you define sane? can’t hear ya. Define sane.
###617 Sane meaning, the most operant behavior to fit a given set of circumstances. Now that’s
###623 alls that it means. Now if a person comes over and says “I broke a leg” say “call
###630 911, go to the nearest hospital, I can’t deal with that” that would be saner, than
###636 saying “oh my god, how did that happen?”- “I fell off a 20 foot ladder” you still
###642 have to call 911 cause you can’t deal with it. Well the person says “don’t you have
###649 any sympathy? What do you mean call 911?”  - “yeah, I’m sorry you broke your leg”
###654 they’d feel better with that, but sane means, to do what you can to help them out of that
###663 situation. Saner, never sane. Wiser, never wise. Smarter, never smart. You know what
###671 that means? So, when a person says “well what’s the answer to all these problems?”
###678 that’s a stupid question, there’s no answer, there are answers as you go along. “I wonder
###689 what Fresco meant by a sane society?” well, nobody ever asked me, but that would be a
###696 lecture in itself. “What’s a sane society?” That society is saner, do you understand what
###705 I’m saying? Now those are the tools I wanted you to know about, to make sure, so when you’re
###714 look at a neurologist, he’s just measuring the reaction the brain has when you stick
###717 a needle here, there, he knows what zone of the brain, he can draw a map of feelings,
###725 depression, he can map out the brain. Then he can look for toxins in the brain, but he
###732 can’t understand the mind, he can’t understand that it’s responding organism. When you
###735 use ‘mind’ you think like the associative system? - Yes, that’s alls you have is the
###745 associative system, you never become sane, can you understand that? If there’s a society
###753 out there that says “boy they’ve attained the ultimate” there could be no such thing.
###755 Ultimate means they’re all [UNKNOWN] when you die it’s ultimate. But we all adjust
###767 constantly? We don’t adjust, we are made that way by circumstances. We either do or
###775 we blow our top. There are people that insist that the world that they have in their head
###781 is the real world, they wind up in institutions. What’s what they have in their head is only
###790 their own little unique differences. So, if you ask a person, they say “I’m not well
###800 mentally” say “what is it that you want?”  - “well I want a fair relationship with
###805 people” or if you went to live in a seminal Indian village, if you don’t talk their
###811 language you’ll never get along with them. So do you wanna become a seminal Indian? Or
###817 do you wanna be you in a seminal village? You can’t be you in a seminal village, you
###822 have to change the village. You have to go into the village and say “everything you
###829 guys do are wrong” and show them a new way, that’s almost impossible, so it’s easier
###832 to kill you, that’s what the Arab Israeli thing is, it can go no where, it’ll never
###841 workout cause they don’t even know what the problem is. The problem is everybody wants
###847 a piece of the pie. Now what does that mean? They want same opportunities other people
###854 have, without discrimination, can’t have that, cause there are people already in power,
###862 only if they lose that power. As I understand it, things were so bad in Russia that the
###870 people revolted, and they shot the royal family, kids an’ all, they didn’t want any carryovers.
###879 So, when Joe Stalin sent people to Siberia to work, they were disruptive to his culture,
###888 or his concept of culture. Now Joe Stalin never said “what kind of concepts should
###896 I have had?” he would never talk that way, he wouldn’t be Joe Stalin if he did. If
###901 you walked over to Hitler and said “suppose you killed all the Jews, then what?” he
###906 doesn’t think about those things, you know what I mean? It isn’t the Jews, it’s the
###915 business world that he doesn’t like. I don’t like Jewish conditioning, but I don’t like
###922 Catholic conditioning, I don’t like Presbyterian conditioning, I don’t like American conditioning,
###929 so it’s the conditioning that’s a problem. But you only do what you can do.
