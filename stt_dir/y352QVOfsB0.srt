2
0:0:3,87 --> 0:0:4,32
JULIE GILHART: Thank you.


3
0:0:4,32 --> 0:0:10,33
So Tess, I have to preface
this to say that when I first


4
0:0:10,33 --> 0:0:12,97
met Tess, I was a
very hungry fashion


5
0:0:12,97 --> 0:0:15,16
director, looking for talent.


6
0:0:15,16 --> 0:0:19,52
And I was obsessed with
finding the best talent first.


7
0:0:19,52 --> 0:0:23,15
And so rumor had
it that there was


8
0:0:23,15 --> 0:0:27,4
someone who was doing production
for fashion shows that


9
0:0:27,4 --> 0:0:32,24
was, in her spare time,
obsessively sewing things.


10
0:0:32,24 --> 0:0:34,74
So in the meatpacking
district-- I


11
0:0:34,74 --> 0:0:36,99
think that's where I first
met you, in the meatpacking


12
0:0:36,99 --> 0:0:39,68
district, before the meatpacking
district was the meatpacking


13
0:0:39,68 --> 0:0:44,73
district-- I went to
her studio, and I did.


14
0:0:44,73 --> 0:0:47,52
I found this girl, and
she was obsessively


15
0:0:47,52 --> 0:0:49,26
sewing at a sewing machine.


16
0:0:49,26 --> 0:0:55,664
But when I say obsessively, it
was, the crux of her collection


17
0:0:55,664 --> 0:0:57,33
was-- or there wasn't
even a collection.


18
0:0:57,33 --> 0:0:58,72
It was just shirts.


19
0:0:58,72 --> 0:1:2,0
And she was obsessively,
like, sewing


20
0:1:2,0 --> 0:1:3,6
on the shirts' top stitching.


21
0:1:3,6 --> 0:1:7,32
So in essence, you
had a shirt that


22
0:1:7,32 --> 0:1:11,48
just had all these crazy
zigzaggy lines on the shirt.


23
0:1:11,48 --> 0:1:13,85
So it looked very crafted.


24
0:1:13,85 --> 0:1:17,6
And it was very
expensive, but very cool.


25
0:1:17,6 --> 0:1:20,69
So I guess my first
question is-- and I never


26
0:1:20,69 --> 0:1:23,87
thought about asking
this-- but what


27
0:1:23,87 --> 0:1:32,39
possessed you to do
that in your spare time,


28
0:1:32,39 --> 0:1:38,87
and how it led you to the--
I want to say indie brand,


29
0:1:38,87 --> 0:1:43,46
but you're not up there in
the "lights, camera, action,"


30
0:1:43,46 --> 0:1:44,61
I always like to say.


31
0:1:44,61 --> 0:1:48,37
You're very, like,
steadfast and artistic


32
0:1:48,37 --> 0:1:51,7
and doing your own thing,
and have garnered, actually,


33
0:1:51,7 --> 0:1:54,81
a lot of respect in a
very-- without having


34
0:1:54,81 --> 0:1:58,14
to shout your brand name.


35
0:1:58,14 --> 0:2:4,3
So what inspired you or
possessed you to start that?


36
0:2:4,3 --> 0:2:6,62
TESS GIBERSON: I knew I
wanted to have my own company.


37
0:2:6,62 --> 0:2:9,41
So I was actually doing
the show production


38
0:2:9,41 --> 0:2:12,99
to support building
my own company.


39
0:2:12,99 --> 0:2:15,92
But I wanted to do it in my
own time, in my own pace.


40
0:2:15,92 --> 0:2:17,73
So I was working with
the show production


41
0:2:17,73 --> 0:2:21,34
to make enough money,
so then I could take off


42
0:2:21,34 --> 0:2:24,22
two to three months at a time
to develop the collection.


43
0:2:24,22 --> 0:2:26,84
So I always knew
in my head that was


44
0:2:26,84 --> 0:2:29,0
my end goal was to
build my own company.


45
0:2:29,0 --> 0:2:32,45
It was always just like, I
wanted something of my own.


46
0:2:32,45 --> 0:2:34,5
But my way of doing
it-- at that point,


47
0:2:34,5 --> 0:2:36,0
I wanted to make
it very-- because I


48
0:2:36,0 --> 0:2:37,63
had been at Calvin Klein.


49
0:2:37,63 --> 0:2:39,56
And I had seen things
on a bigger scale.


50
0:2:39,56 --> 0:2:42,11
And I had seen
things where it was


51
0:2:42,11 --> 0:2:46,2
very-- everything was very
refined and very clean and very


52
0:2:46,2 --> 0:2:46,52
modern.


53
0:2:46,52 --> 0:2:48,11
But I wanted to make it my own.


54
0:2:48,11 --> 0:2:51,68
So when I started working
on my own collection,


55
0:2:51,68 --> 0:2:55,48
it was all about having this
personalization with the pieces


56
0:2:55,48 --> 0:2:59,6
and really, really
making my own mark.


57
0:2:59,6 --> 0:3:1,54
So that was my feeling,
but it was also, literally,


58
0:3:1,54 --> 0:3:4,33
I was making my own
mark by making the mark


59
0:3:4,33 --> 0:3:7,31
making that I was doing
on every single piece.


60
0:3:7,31 --> 0:3:10,5
And in the beginning--
I mean, I think


61
0:3:10,5 --> 0:3:14,63
I just wanted to
experiment, and to really


62
0:3:14,63 --> 0:3:16,1
push myself as much as I could.


63
0:3:16,1 --> 0:3:20,77
Because I knew at a certain
point, it would be more public.


64
0:3:20,77 --> 0:3:24,3
And at that point when I met
you, it was still so personal.


65
0:3:24,3 --> 0:3:26,15
And I could do anything.


66
0:3:26,15 --> 0:3:29,21
And I hadn't revealed
it to anyone yet.


67
0:3:29,21 --> 0:3:32,29
And I remember-- I mean, this is
stuff they always tell people.


68
0:3:32,29 --> 0:3:36,88
Julie came, and she had me
come up to the Barney's offices


69
0:3:36,88 --> 0:3:40,27
and said they wanted
to place an order.


70
0:3:40,27 --> 0:3:42,23
And at the time I
was like, I really


71
0:3:42,23 --> 0:3:43,95
don't think I can take an order.


72
0:3:43,95 --> 0:3:47,96
I just don't know if I'm
ready to expand that much.


73
0:3:47,96 --> 0:3:48,72
Because I was just
selling to one store


74
0:3:48,72 --> 0:3:50,3
and making one of a kind pieces.


75
0:3:50,3 --> 0:3:53,2
And Julie had to-- actually,
she took me aside and she had


76
0:3:53,2 --> 0:3:56,73
to really convince me that
I should take the order


77
0:3:56,73 --> 0:3:58,33
for Barney's.


78
0:3:58,33 --> 0:4:1,9
But it was really--
honestly, Julie


79
0:4:1,9 --> 0:4:4,83
was the one who got me
started, who kind of just


80
0:4:4,83 --> 0:4:9,34
got me into making
the production,


81
0:4:9,34 --> 0:4:11,32
following the deliveries.


82
0:4:11,32 --> 0:4:13,56
And I think I did it
for two more seasons


83
0:4:13,56 --> 0:4:16,98
when I was working
part-time on my collection.


84
0:4:16,98 --> 0:4:19,22
And then after that,
I just did full-time,


85
0:4:19,22 --> 0:4:22,81
and then I started just full-on
doing my own collection.


86
0:4:22,81 --> 0:4:30,88
JULIE GILHART: It's interesting
because there's so much support


87
0:4:30,88 --> 0:4:38,1
for designers now, in terms
of mentorship and grants


88
0:4:38,1 --> 0:4:42,11
and money and all
kinds of things.


89
0:4:42,11 --> 0:4:44,8
And then, there wasn't.


90
0:4:44,8 --> 0:4:46,26
But it's really interesting.


91
0:4:46,26 --> 0:4:50,29
And maybe you can comment on
this, because in thinking, I've


92
0:4:50,29 --> 0:4:53,6
been developing
designers my whole life.


93
0:4:53,6 --> 0:4:57,74
And so the really great talents,
like the Nicolas Ghesquieres,


94
0:4:57,74 --> 0:5:2,942
the [INAUDIBLE] the
Olivier Theyskens,


95
0:5:2,942 --> 0:5:6,87
those people didn't have
any of this support.


96
0:5:6,87 --> 0:5:13,33
Now I can't say that today
there is that caliber out there.


97
0:5:13,33 --> 0:5:17,95
So the only thing
I can think of is


98
0:5:17,95 --> 0:5:21,29
it's the way that
we're doing things.


99
0:5:21,29 --> 0:5:24,28
But I'm not sure--
I'm not a designer.


100
0:5:24,28 --> 0:5:29,58
So I'm wondering what you think
of what you were doing back


101
0:5:29,58 --> 0:5:32,34
then, because how you
describe that is exactly


102
0:5:32,34 --> 0:5:35,92
the same way that Olivier
Theyskens started,


103
0:5:35,92 --> 0:5:38,2
Alexander McQueen started.


104
0:5:38,2 --> 0:5:39,9
That it's very
much more concerned


105
0:5:39,9 --> 0:5:42,71
about the craft of the
clothing, rather than


106
0:5:42,71 --> 0:5:44,88
the commerciality
of the clothing.


107
0:5:44,88 --> 0:5:47,18
And it was a very
personal thing.


108
0:5:47,18 --> 0:5:52,78
So I'm wondering, what are
your thoughts about that?


109
0:5:52,78 --> 0:5:55,75
TESS GIBERSON: I
think when I started,


110
0:5:55,75 --> 0:5:58,64
it was-- I left
Calvin Klein in '98.


111
0:5:58,64 --> 0:6:4,32
So I spent from '98 to 2001 just
kind of incubating it myself,


112
0:6:4,32 --> 0:6:6,75
just developing it.


113
0:6:6,75 --> 0:6:13,31
And I think back then, the
only way to make it happen,


114
0:6:13,31 --> 0:6:14,67
I wanted it so badly.


115
0:6:14,67 --> 0:6:16,54
And it was just out of passion.


116
0:6:16,54 --> 0:6:20,9
And there wasn't any CFDA,
Vogue fund didn't exist.


117
0:6:20,9 --> 0:6:24,56
That wasn't until,
I think, 2003.


118
0:6:24,56 --> 0:6:27,714
It was just, there was a
community of other designers.


119
0:6:27,714 --> 0:6:28,88
And we supported each other.


120
0:6:28,88 --> 0:6:32,64
And it was through,
I think, peer support


121
0:6:32,64 --> 0:6:36,6
and just-- I knew
inside what I wanted.


122
0:6:36,6 --> 0:6:38,53
JULIE GILHART: What did
you want most, though?


123
0:6:38,53 --> 0:6:42,31
What was it that
you wanted most?


124
0:6:42,31 --> 0:6:43,53
TESS GIBERSON: For
me at that point,


125
0:6:43,53 --> 0:6:45,74
it was just the
personal expression.


126
0:6:45,74 --> 0:6:47,82
I wanted to do
something that was me.


127
0:6:47,82 --> 0:6:57,27
I wanted to put
my own vision out.


128
0:6:57,27 --> 0:6:58,96
Now I think about a company.


129
0:6:58,96 --> 0:7:2,7
At that time, I wanted
to develop my own vision,


130
0:7:2,7 --> 0:7:3,98
and I wanted to express it.


131
0:7:3,98 --> 0:7:7,93
And I knew-- I've always
been very organized,


132
0:7:7,93 --> 0:7:10,13
so I did things in
an organized way.


133
0:7:10,13 --> 0:7:14,74
But it was about having
this personal expression.


134
0:7:14,74 --> 0:7:15,49
JULIE GILHART:
That's probably why


135
0:7:15,49 --> 0:7:17,8
Calvin-- working
at Calvin-- I mean,


136
0:7:17,8 --> 0:7:21,12
I can kind of see a creative
person working there and seeing


137
0:7:21,12 --> 0:7:24,1
how it's done on a mass
scale, but that you


138
0:7:24,1 --> 0:7:27,2
would want to do
something that was yours.


139
0:7:27,2 --> 0:7:30,98
And that's how Calvin started,
and Ralph Lauren and Donna


140
0:7:30,98 --> 0:7:32,4
Karan.


141
0:7:32,4 --> 0:7:33,62
I mean, it's really interesting.


142
0:7:33,62 --> 0:7:37,81
But I think what's
interesting now


143
0:7:37,81 --> 0:7:40,95
is all the access that we have.


144
0:7:40,95 --> 0:7:44,13
Like, we have two really
amazing collaborators


145
0:7:44,13 --> 0:7:45,26
that work with you.


146
0:7:45,26 --> 0:7:50,93
And I think designers
have always collaborated


147
0:7:50,93 --> 0:7:56,78
with people, but it's
almost a part of your--


148
0:7:56,78 --> 0:8:3,13
it's a criteria in a way, like
who you're collaborating also


149
0:8:3,13 --> 0:8:4,28
is reflecting on you.


150
0:8:4,28 --> 0:8:7,47
Because everyone's
collaborating.


151
0:8:7,47 --> 0:8:11,52
TESS GIBERSON: I went to RISD,
and when I was in school,


152
0:8:11,52 --> 0:8:13,97
that was part of being at
RISD, was you collaborated.


153
0:8:13,97 --> 0:8:18,97
You collaborated with painters
or graphic designers or textile


154
0:8:18,97 --> 0:8:21,85
designers, and it was just
part of this give and take.


155
0:8:21,85 --> 0:8:25,13
And good ideas always came
from working with other people.


156
0:8:25,13 --> 0:8:28,4
So it was just very much the
way that I'm used to working.


157
0:8:28,4 --> 0:8:30,37
And when I first started,
I worked with my husband


158
0:8:30,37 --> 0:8:32,13
all the time, who's a painter.


159
0:8:32,13 --> 0:8:35,282
And it was just-- we started
the first couple of collections.


160
0:8:35,282 --> 0:8:36,49
We always were collaborating.


161
0:8:36,49 --> 0:8:38,87
And I pulled my sister,
who's an artist, into it.


162
0:8:38,87 --> 0:8:42,679
And then we started looking
out to friends who are artists.


163
0:8:42,679 --> 0:8:46,16
And I worked with filmmakers,
photographers, set designers,


164
0:8:46,16 --> 0:8:47,89
lighting designers.


165
0:8:47,89 --> 0:8:48,63
And they were just
very close friends


166
0:8:48,63 --> 0:8:50,81
who also I respected
their work a lot.


167
0:8:50,81 --> 0:8:53,11
So it's just like,
I've always known


168
0:8:53,11 --> 0:8:54,88
collaboration is exciting.


169
0:8:54,88 --> 0:8:57,7
And when you respect
the other person's work,


170
0:8:57,7 --> 0:8:58,56
it's always good no matter what.


171
0:8:58,56 --> 0:9:1,72
I don't think about what
it has to look like.


172
0:9:1,72 --> 0:9:3,56
And I don't second-guess it.


173
0:9:3,56 --> 0:9:6,39
It's just if I respect someone's
work and I like it a lot,


174
0:9:6,39 --> 0:9:7,35
it works out well.


175
0:9:7,35 --> 0:9:12,88
And so when I relaunched
the new company,


176
0:9:12,88 --> 0:9:14,97
that was very important
to continue that.


177
0:9:14,97 --> 0:9:17,3
And so I've continued
it, even though now we


178
0:9:17,3 --> 0:9:19,6
do things-- I don't
sew it myself anymore.


179
0:9:19,6 --> 0:9:22,82
I don't-- it's different.


180
0:9:22,82 --> 0:9:23,4
It's on a bigger scale.


181
0:9:23,4 --> 0:9:24,78
But I still maintain
the collaborations,


182
0:9:24,78 --> 0:9:27,5
because that's for my heart.


183
0:9:27,5 --> 0:9:28,55
That's what I love to do.


184
0:9:28,55 --> 0:9:31,86
And that gives me so
much more creatively.


185
0:9:31,86 --> 0:9:34,59
And I met Alia, and
I loved her work.


186
0:9:34,59 --> 0:9:36,63
And I asked her to do
a video and it just


187
0:9:36,63 --> 0:9:38,1
continued from there.


188
0:9:38,1 --> 0:9:41,73
And then through a
friend, I met Caroline.


189
0:9:41,73 --> 0:9:43,8
And I loved what I heard.


190
0:9:43,8 --> 0:9:44,66
And then I met
her, and I thought,


191
0:9:44,66 --> 0:9:48,62
it was just an instant-- it was
just something intuitive that I


192
0:9:48,62 --> 0:9:50,84
knew and we
connected right away.


193
0:9:50,84 --> 0:9:54,98
And first I asked her to be
in a presentation last year.


194
0:9:54,98 --> 0:9:56,83
And then I had her
do music, and then it


195
0:9:56,83 --> 0:9:59,29
was natural to ask her to
do the music for the video.


196
0:9:59,29 --> 0:10:1,892
So everything I do
is very intuitive.


197
0:10:1,892 --> 0:10:3,85
JULIE GILHART: So you
have sort of an entourage


198
0:10:3,85 --> 0:10:4,94
of collaborators.


199
0:10:4,94 --> 0:10:7,972



200
0:10:7,972 --> 0:10:9,93
TESS GIBERSON: I have a
lot of nice collections


201
0:10:9,93 --> 0:10:11,155
of collaborations.


202
0:10:11,155 --> 0:10:12,155
But they're all genuine.


203
0:10:12,155 --> 0:10:15,6
They're people I
love and I respect.


204
0:10:15,6 --> 0:10:18,575
And it's just such a
natural relationship.


205
0:10:18,575 --> 0:10:22,94
JULIE GILHART: Isn't it
funny, because collaboration


206
0:10:22,94 --> 0:10:26,28
with many designers is all
about making more money.


207
0:10:26,28 --> 0:10:28,37
You collaborate with
a certain person


208
0:10:28,37 --> 0:10:30,58
so that it will
sell more product.


209
0:10:30,58 --> 0:10:34,58
And it sounds like
in your vernacular,


210
0:10:34,58 --> 0:10:37,52
that it's really collaborating
from an artistic and respect


211
0:10:37,52 --> 0:10:38,104
point of view.


212
0:10:38,104 --> 0:10:39,936
CAROLINE POLACHEK: Well,
if I may interject,


213
0:10:39,936 --> 0:10:42,92
Tess is actually a really easy
person to collaborate with too.


214
0:10:42,92 --> 0:10:45,71
I think a lot of designers have
gimmicks in each collection,


215
0:10:45,71 --> 0:10:47,917
or like maybe even a kind
of extremely intense theme


216
0:10:47,917 --> 0:10:49,75
that continues throughout
their collections.


217
0:10:49,75 --> 0:10:52,412
And I think in order to
collaborate with someone


218
0:10:52,412 --> 0:10:53,87
like that, you feel
like you really


219
0:10:53,87 --> 0:10:57,689
have to make something that
goes with the particular story


220
0:10:57,689 --> 0:10:58,23
or the theme.


221
0:10:58,23 --> 0:11:2,2
But Tess' work is so
open that it really


222
0:11:2,2 --> 0:11:6,56
allows you to not only explore
within your own medium,


223
0:11:6,56 --> 0:11:9,967
like for example, the music
I did for this video is


224
0:11:9,967 --> 0:11:12,3
the kind of music I had been
wanting to make for a while


225
0:11:12,3 --> 0:11:14,258
actually, but hadn't had
the right opportunity.


226
0:11:14,258 --> 0:11:17,0
And the clothes presented
the perfect way to do it.


227
0:11:17,0 --> 0:11:19,68



228
0:11:19,68 --> 0:11:23,35
But also, I think it allows
people to do something that's,


229
0:11:23,35 --> 0:11:27,9
like, peaceful and neutral
and tasteful and textured.


230
0:11:27,9 --> 0:11:31,805
And it's really a great
environment to collaborate in.


231
0:11:31,805 --> 0:11:34,21
JULIE GILHART: What's
the-- both of you


232
0:11:34,21 --> 0:11:37,99
all should comment--
what's the process?


233
0:11:37,99 --> 0:11:41,78
Like, do you come
together and say, well,


234
0:11:41,78 --> 0:11:43,1
what are we going to do?


235
0:11:43,1 --> 0:11:46,63
Or is it like, I have this
idea, and you expand on it?


236
0:11:46,63 --> 0:11:49,41
How does that work, or is
it different every time?


237
0:11:49,41 --> 0:11:52,1
ALIA RAZA: It's been--
we've collaborated together


238
0:11:52,1 --> 0:11:53,9
three times now.


239
0:11:53,9 --> 0:11:56,96
We've made three short little
films, or videos together.


240
0:11:56,96 --> 0:12:1,1
And I think each time started
with a meeting, just talking,


241
0:12:1,1 --> 0:12:5,1
lunch, whatever-- talking
about what she was working on,


242
0:12:5,1 --> 0:12:6,53
what I was working on.


243
0:12:6,53 --> 0:12:9,15
And then me looking
at the clothes


244
0:12:9,15 --> 0:12:12,7
that she was working on that
she wanted to put in the video.


245
0:12:12,7 --> 0:12:14,85
And then, just thinking
about the practical stuff,


246
0:12:14,85 --> 0:12:16,71
like the music and the location.


247
0:12:16,71 --> 0:12:20,585
And all of that comes
together to-- it's


248
0:12:20,585 --> 0:12:22,71
not like we're working with
million-dollar budgets,


249
0:12:22,71 --> 0:12:25,422
so you're not dreaming
up fantasy worlds


250
0:12:25,422 --> 0:12:26,38
and making them happen.


251
0:12:26,38 --> 0:12:28,2
You have to work
with what you have.


252
0:12:28,2 --> 0:12:31,24
So the location, the music,
the clothes, all of it


253
0:12:31,24 --> 0:12:34,82
comes together to inspire
what you end up with.


254
0:12:34,82 --> 0:12:36,78
And what you end
up with is usually


255
0:12:36,78 --> 0:12:40,43
a little bit different from
what the original idea is.


256
0:12:40,43 --> 0:12:45,15
Like, for the video that we
all just worked on together,


257
0:12:45,15 --> 0:12:47,4
I had this idea of
spiders in my head.


258
0:12:47,4 --> 0:12:52,56
And Tess had this kind of giant
crochet piece in her runway


259
0:12:52,56 --> 0:12:55,85
show, and it kind of
looked like a spider web.


260
0:12:55,85 --> 0:12:58,96
It just all felt right to me.


261
0:12:58,96 --> 0:13:3,54
And now when you see the video,
you don't think of a spider.


262
0:13:3,54 --> 0:13:7,3
There's no spiders in the video.


263
0:13:7,3 --> 0:13:8,58
The clothes aren't spidery.


264
0:13:8,58 --> 0:13:12,65
It sounds crazy,
but the idea shifts


265
0:13:12,65 --> 0:13:14,24
over time, and with each step.


266
0:13:14,24 --> 0:13:15,405
JULIE GILHART: [INAUDIBLE].


267
0:13:15,405 --> 0:13:17,4
ALIA RAZA: Yeah.


268
0:13:17,4 --> 0:13:19,45
It's a fashion
thing, I think, and I


269
0:13:19,45 --> 0:13:24,4
think if you're making films,
or if you're making art,


270
0:13:24,4 --> 0:13:26,26
or whatever you're
making, it always


271
0:13:26,26 --> 0:13:27,83
changes during the process.


272
0:13:27,83 --> 0:13:29,855
It always changes
as you're working.


273
0:13:29,855 --> 0:13:36,83
JULIE GILHART: It's interesting,
because now-- for the audience,


274
0:13:36,83 --> 0:13:39,4
I'm working on this very
cool project for [INAUDIBLE]


275
0:13:39,4 --> 0:13:43,19
and it's the
initiation of a prize.


276
0:13:43,19 --> 0:13:46,34
And it's for talent
all over the world.


277
0:13:46,34 --> 0:13:49,53
And it's for really,
really new talent.


278
0:13:49,53 --> 0:13:54,15
So it's really interesting is
you have access to people that


279
0:13:54,15 --> 0:13:58,77
are doing things on a
fashion level in places


280
0:13:58,77 --> 0:14:4,24
like Afghanistan or Nigeria
or just crazy places


281
0:14:4,24 --> 0:14:9,3
that I would never look, or
you would never have access to.


282
0:14:9,3 --> 0:14:11,505
But the thing that
I look at the most


283
0:14:11,505 --> 0:14:15,67
is videos, because
they all have videos.


284
0:14:15,67 --> 0:14:19,94
And so you're looking at
a picture of girls or men


285
0:14:19,94 --> 0:14:23,9
in clothing, and you're
reading, and you're


286
0:14:23,9 --> 0:14:25,53
looking at all their facts--
the age of the designer,


287
0:14:25,53 --> 0:14:27,321
and how many collections
that they've done.


288
0:14:27,321 --> 0:14:29,39
But it's really the
video that speaks.


289
0:14:29,39 --> 0:14:34,17
And then, addressing the
music thing for a show,


290
0:14:34,17 --> 0:14:37,68
that is so much a
part of the show.


291
0:14:37,68 --> 0:14:42,68
You could have a great
show with great clothes,


292
0:14:42,68 --> 0:14:46,15
and if the music isn't
good, it can fall flat.


293
0:14:46,15 --> 0:14:48,97
And it can actually change
your perception of the clothes.


294
0:14:48,97 --> 0:14:51,1
It's distracting.


295
0:14:51,1 --> 0:14:56,926
But the reverse, if you have
great music, it can also--


296
0:14:56,926 --> 0:14:58,8
CAROLINE POLACHEK: It's
so subconscious, too.


297
0:14:58,8 --> 0:15:0,522
It totally sneaks
in the back door.


298
0:15:0,522 --> 0:15:2,48
You're looking at the
clothes, and if the music


299
0:15:2,48 --> 0:15:4,355
is heavy and hard, you
don't even realize it,


300
0:15:4,355 --> 0:15:7,41
but you're attributing that
energy to the clothes, too.


301
0:15:7,41 --> 0:15:9,602
Like, you could show a
piece that's really dainty.


302
0:15:9,602 --> 0:15:11,6
And if it's paired
with hard music,


303
0:15:11,6 --> 0:15:12,7
you all of a sudden
imagine it being


304
0:15:12,7 --> 0:15:15,67
worn in a really specific way.


305
0:15:15,67 --> 0:15:19,404
I'm kind of new to
working in fashion at all.


306
0:15:19,404 --> 0:15:21,7
And one thing that I
love that designers


307
0:15:21,7 --> 0:15:23,6
say when they're designing,
is they talk about their girl.


308
0:15:23,6 --> 0:15:25,25
Like, who's your
girl this season?


309
0:15:25,25 --> 0:15:26,65
And at first I didn't
really understand


310
0:15:26,65 --> 0:15:27,858
what they were talking about.


311
0:15:27,858 --> 0:15:29,51
But they visualize a person.


312
0:15:29,51 --> 0:15:30,76
And it's not just the clothes.


313
0:15:30,76 --> 0:15:32,26
You can visualize
where it's going


314
0:15:32,26 --> 0:15:37,37
to be worn, where she
lives, how old she is,


315
0:15:37,37 --> 0:15:38,329
what she listens to.


316
0:15:38,329 --> 0:15:40,37
And I think the fashion
show is the manifestation


317
0:15:40,37 --> 0:15:42,23
not of just a
collection, but the girl.


318
0:15:42,23 --> 0:15:44,41
And that plays back into
marketing and branding.


319
0:15:44,41 --> 0:15:46,999
And that to me is actually
the most interesting aspect


320
0:15:46,999 --> 0:15:47,79
of the whole thing.


321
0:15:47,79 --> 0:15:50,88
JULIE GILHART: If you
ever go into a showroom--


322
0:15:50,88 --> 0:15:52,91
and this happens
at a high level--


323
0:15:52,91 --> 0:15:55,97
and you have them showing
you the collection,


324
0:15:55,97 --> 0:16:0,8
they'll call each--
like they'll say "she,"


325
0:16:0,8 --> 0:16:3,22
she's really going
to be a good seller.


326
0:16:3,22 --> 0:16:7,447
Or she is perfect,
or she's my favorite.


327
0:16:7,447 --> 0:16:9,78
ALIA RAZA: Who are they talking
about when you say she--


328
0:16:9,78 --> 0:16:12,7
JULIE GILHART: They're talking
about garments on a hanger.


329
0:16:12,7 --> 0:16:17,9
And I just like, I got
to get out of here.


330
0:16:17,9 --> 0:16:20,51
I just lose it when they
start talking-- when they just


331
0:16:20,51 --> 0:16:22,99
put this person.


332
0:16:22,99 --> 0:16:25,46
But this is the "she" thing.


333
0:16:25,46 --> 0:16:29,29
I never realized that yeah,
they talk about their girl.


334
0:16:29,29 --> 0:16:31,57
ALIA RAZA: Well, I have to
say that working with Tess,


335
0:16:31,57 --> 0:16:36,1
she might have a girl in mind
when she does every collection,


336
0:16:36,1 --> 0:16:40,72
but she's never imposed
that on me or told me,


337
0:16:40,72 --> 0:16:44,86
this is the kind of girl or the
persona or the characterization


338
0:16:44,86 --> 0:16:45,49
that you should
put in the video.


339
0:16:45,49 --> 0:16:49,101
It's never-- she almost
tells me nothing.


340
0:16:49,101 --> 0:16:50,6
She just lets me
look at the clothes


341
0:16:50,6 --> 0:16:52,61
and decide who I
want the girl to be.


342
0:16:52,61 --> 0:16:54,64
And that's a great
thing about working


343
0:16:54,64 --> 0:16:56,45
with people who
are more interested


344
0:16:56,45 --> 0:17:1,584
in kind of the collaboration
between different artists,


345
0:17:1,584 --> 0:17:3,0
rather than, like
you were saying,


346
0:17:3,0 --> 0:17:5,72
on a purely commercial level
of trying to sell this image,


347
0:17:5,72 --> 0:17:6,56
or this one girl.


348
0:17:6,56 --> 0:17:7,935
CAROLINE POLACHEK:
Actually, when


349
0:17:7,935 --> 0:17:10,27
I met with Tess to discuss
the music for this collection


350
0:17:10,27 --> 0:17:13,49
for the runway show, there
wasn't any discussion


351
0:17:13,49 --> 0:17:17,859
of the girl or anything
situational or social at all.


352
0:17:17,859 --> 0:17:19,99
It was only about line quality.


353
0:17:19,99 --> 0:17:21,49
She was showing me
Bauhaus drawings.


354
0:17:21,49 --> 0:17:25,1
She was showing me
photographs from the '60s


355
0:17:25,1 --> 0:17:27,15
of a girl inside a huge
crochet installation.


356
0:17:27,15 --> 0:17:29,256
She was showing me the
drawings of the pieces.


357
0:17:29,256 --> 0:17:30,63
And I went to
school for drawing,


358
0:17:30,63 --> 0:17:32,7
so this totally
resonated with me.


359
0:17:32,7 --> 0:17:37,54
And I just instantly heard
string, piano, digital lines,


360
0:17:37,54 --> 0:17:39,59
acoustic lines,
lines out of tune.


361
0:17:39,59 --> 0:17:41,7
And that music came right
out of that, and nothing


362
0:17:41,7 --> 0:17:43,45
to do with-- is she a traveler?


363
0:17:43,45 --> 0:17:46,15
Is she young?


364
0:17:46,15 --> 0:17:47,65
What does she do?


365
0:17:47,65 --> 0:17:51,44
It was just very formal and
very abstract, and I loved that.


366
0:17:51,44 --> 0:17:54,61
TESS GIBERSON: And I can work
that way because of the people


367
0:17:54,61 --> 0:17:57,57
I choose to collaborate with.


368
0:17:57,57 --> 0:17:59,69
I'm very picky
about who I choose.


369
0:17:59,69 --> 0:18:2,21
And it's always, there
has to be the respect,


370
0:18:2,21 --> 0:18:3,38
and I like their work.


371
0:18:3,38 --> 0:18:5,7
And then I know it's--
like I was saying before,


372
0:18:5,7 --> 0:18:8,52
then I can have that trust
that it's going to be OK.


373
0:18:8,52 --> 0:18:10,89
And I don't have to say,
this is how it has to be.


374
0:18:10,89 --> 0:18:12,89
And I think that's what
a good collaboration is,


375
0:18:12,89 --> 0:18:14,63
is where you can let go.


376
0:18:14,63 --> 0:18:16,719
Like for me, I come
with, I have the idea


377
0:18:16,719 --> 0:18:18,1
and I know what my clothes are.


378
0:18:18,1 --> 0:18:21,535
But I don't-- I can't tell
you what the video should look


379
0:18:21,535 --> 0:18:22,91
like, because I'm
not a director.


380
0:18:22,91 --> 0:18:25,42
And I can't tell you what
the music should sound like.


381
0:18:25,42 --> 0:18:26,23
I don't make music.


382
0:18:26,23 --> 0:18:28,5
And I think it gets
tricky when you


383
0:18:28,5 --> 0:18:32,29
try-- when someone who-- if a
designer tries to direct when


384
0:18:32,29 --> 0:18:34,6
they're not a director, you
don't get the right result.


385
0:18:34,6 --> 0:18:38,9
But if I can just let
it go, and really trust,


386
0:18:38,9 --> 0:18:39,9
and then it's exciting.


387
0:18:39,9 --> 0:18:41,95
I love not knowing
what it will look like,


388
0:18:41,95 --> 0:18:47,53
and then it's a really cool
surprise to see the end result.


389
0:18:47,53 --> 0:18:50,3
JULIE GILHART: It's
interesting because I think--


390
0:18:50,3 --> 0:18:54,47
I've seen so many
designers when they start


391
0:18:54,47 --> 0:18:56,73
in the business of
fashion, pre-collections


392
0:18:56,73 --> 0:18:59,46
have become so important.


393
0:18:59,46 --> 0:19:2,72
Those collections that are
before the runway, that


394
0:19:2,72 --> 0:19:4,1
come into the stores early.


395
0:19:4,1 --> 0:19:10,47
And that's actually where
you can address the more


396
0:19:10,47 --> 0:19:14,36
day-to-day needs, rather than
the fantasy needs, in a way.


397
0:19:14,36 --> 0:19:17,76
But it's interesting,
because usually when


398
0:19:17,76 --> 0:19:21,15
a show comes around,
collaborators come in.


399
0:19:21,15 --> 0:19:24,21
And what the designer told me
the show was going to be about


400
0:19:24,21 --> 0:19:28,92
is never what they say.


401
0:19:28,92 --> 0:19:32,54
And I think it's because
of the collaborators.


402
0:19:32,54 --> 0:19:33,789
ALIA RAZA: Do you like that?


403
0:19:33,789 --> 0:19:35,83
Do you like seeing a new
angle on it, or do you--


404
0:19:35,83 --> 0:19:36,663
JULIE GILHART: Yeah.


405
0:19:36,663 --> 0:19:39,87
I mean, I like for people
to be spontaneous and not


406
0:19:39,87 --> 0:19:41,99
get stuck, and have to do that.


407
0:19:41,99 --> 0:19:44,85
You have to be open,
but that probably


408
0:19:44,85 --> 0:19:46,83
happens in your
process, like one idea


409
0:19:46,83 --> 0:19:51,1
you have because you talked to
her, and you all start to talk,


410
0:19:51,1 --> 0:19:52,97
it sort of morphs
into something else,


411
0:19:52,97 --> 0:19:56,23
which really enhances
the creative thing.


412
0:19:56,23 --> 0:19:59,19
And it gets you away from
the business of fashion,


413
0:19:59,19 --> 0:20:3,32
and the trends, and feeling all
these subliminal messages that


414
0:20:3,32 --> 0:20:5,429
come in that you feel
like, I have to do that.


415
0:20:5,429 --> 0:20:7,97
TESS GIBERSON: And that's what's
so important about coming up


416
0:20:7,97 --> 0:20:11,98
with new ideas and actually
finding new designs that


417
0:20:11,98 --> 0:20:13,31
come from yourself.


418
0:20:13,31 --> 0:20:15,63
I think that's what
collaborations really


419
0:20:15,63 --> 0:20:20,8
give me, is they continue
to give me that creativity.


420
0:20:20,8 --> 0:20:23,89
Otherwise, it's too
easy to get stuck


421
0:20:23,89 --> 0:20:27,5
into the deadlines,
the deliveries.


422
0:20:27,5 --> 0:20:30,27
That's all part of the business.


423
0:20:30,27 --> 0:20:33,25
And I like that part
separately, but I also


424
0:20:33,25 --> 0:20:36,45
know I need the creative
energy to come in.


425
0:20:36,45 --> 0:20:38,56
And I get that through
the collaborations.


426
0:20:38,56 --> 0:20:40,52
JULIE GILHART: So
it's also interesting,


427
0:20:40,52 --> 0:20:49,75
because how do you tell people
about you, in terms of, like,


428
0:20:49,75 --> 0:20:55,713
you don't advertise, and you
don't have a big publicist.


429
0:20:55,713 --> 0:21:0,97



430
0:21:0,97 --> 0:21:4,71
But yet, people-- how
are you communicating


431
0:21:4,71 --> 0:21:6,62
some of these
things that you do?


432
0:21:6,62 --> 0:21:8,81
And I'm saying
that in the context


433
0:21:8,81 --> 0:21:14,27
of being at Barney's
when we first started.


434
0:21:14,27 --> 0:21:16,66
And you'd have to
put it practically


435
0:21:16,66 --> 0:21:18,31
when people got off
the escalator so


436
0:21:18,31 --> 0:21:20,6
that they would see it.


437
0:21:20,6 --> 0:21:23,14
And then you'd have to talk
to the salespeople a lot.


438
0:21:23,14 --> 0:21:25,72
And then you have to
try and see if you


439
0:21:25,72 --> 0:21:28,3
can put it in the catalog.


440
0:21:28,3 --> 0:21:31,9
And so it was very basic now.


441
0:21:31,9 --> 0:21:34,62
And now we have all the social
media and visual things.


442
0:21:34,62 --> 0:21:38,699
So one has to choose
how they do that.


443
0:21:38,699 --> 0:21:40,49
And that's also now
I'm seeing a reflection


444
0:21:40,49 --> 0:21:43,19
of how you are as a brand, too.


445
0:21:43,19 --> 0:21:45,62
TESS GIBERSON: We've
actually-- social media


446
0:21:45,62 --> 0:21:46,52
has been great for
us, because it's


447
0:21:46,52 --> 0:21:49,74
a way for us to directly
tell the story of what


448
0:21:49,74 --> 0:21:54,57
the collection is, who I
am, the project I'm doing.


449
0:21:54,57 --> 0:21:59,31
It's a direct
connection to customers,


450
0:21:59,31 --> 0:22:0,58
anyone who's interested.


451
0:22:0,58 --> 0:22:3,56
It's just like, it
reaches out directly.


452
0:22:3,56 --> 0:22:7,23
We still work through PR,
working with magazines,


453
0:22:7,23 --> 0:22:10,734
working online, and
also just publications.


454
0:22:10,734 --> 0:22:11,9
JULIE GILHART: Traditional--


455
0:22:11,9 --> 0:22:13,24
TESS GIBERSON: Traditional.


456
0:22:13,24 --> 0:22:14,8
So I do both.


457
0:22:14,8 --> 0:22:16,85
But the last two
years, we've really


458
0:22:16,85 --> 0:22:18,48
embraced the social
media in just


459
0:22:18,48 --> 0:22:20,96
being able to tell
our own story.


460
0:22:20,96 --> 0:22:23,15
And that's been really exciting.


461
0:22:23,15 --> 0:22:25,88
And it's just, for a
brand, for our brand


462
0:22:25,88 --> 0:22:27,94
it's also through
direct relationship


463
0:22:27,94 --> 0:22:30,5
with the customers--
going to the store,


464
0:22:30,5 --> 0:22:33,0
working with customers,
meeting customers.


465
0:22:33,0 --> 0:22:36,72
And when people wear the
clothes, they become fans.


466
0:22:36,72 --> 0:22:40,5
And it's really been this
just growing word of mouth,


467
0:22:40,5 --> 0:22:43,87
and directly
working with people.


468
0:22:43,87 --> 0:22:44,702
And they get it.


469
0:22:44,702 --> 0:22:46,41
When they put the
clothes on, they really


470
0:22:46,41 --> 0:22:47,489
get what it's about.


471
0:22:47,489 --> 0:22:48,78
They get what I'm trying to do.


472
0:22:48,78 --> 0:22:50,51
And I don't have
to say anything.


473
0:22:50,51 --> 0:22:52,78
They tell me how they
feel about the clothes.


474
0:22:52,78 --> 0:22:54,75
And that's been so
exciting to see.


475
0:22:54,75 --> 0:22:59,37



476
0:22:59,37 --> 0:23:0,94
JULIE GILHART: I
can't help but think


477
0:23:0,94 --> 0:23:3,55
that that's going to be really
important for the future,


478
0:23:3,55 --> 0:23:7,5
that because you see
all these mass brands,


479
0:23:7,5 --> 0:23:12,13
and they're communicated a
lot, and they sell a lot.


480
0:23:12,13 --> 0:23:14,17
I don't know, how do
you all feel about that?


481
0:23:14,17 --> 0:23:17,35
I mean, I'm more
attracted to something--


482
0:23:17,35 --> 0:23:19,12
and today people say "luxury."


483
0:23:19,12 --> 0:23:21,45
But luxury to me
is something now


484
0:23:21,45 --> 0:23:23,66
that's not so easily accessible.


485
0:23:23,66 --> 0:23:26,665
CAROLINE POLACHEK: Well, I
think that actually-- maybe this


486
0:23:26,665 --> 0:23:28,79
is a little bit grim-- but
I do see it as a luxury,


487
0:23:28,79 --> 0:23:29,831
especially in the future.


488
0:23:29,831 --> 0:23:32,6
Because now that
so much production


489
0:23:32,6 --> 0:23:36,36
is outsourced and expected to
happen at very cheap prices,


490
0:23:36,36 --> 0:23:38,36
our idea of how much we
need to pay for a shirt,


491
0:23:38,36 --> 0:23:40,485
and with the quality of
what we're going to expect,


492
0:23:40,485 --> 0:23:41,34
has gotten very low.


493
0:23:41,34 --> 0:23:46,3
Like maybe a girl who's like
25 thinks the average price


494
0:23:46,3 --> 0:23:48,23
you should expect to pay
for a shirt is, like,


495
0:23:48,23 --> 0:23:49,999
between $30 and
$50 or something.


496
0:23:49,999 --> 0:23:51,79
But in order to make
something really well,


497
0:23:51,79 --> 0:23:53,789
in order to source
nice fabrics--


498
0:23:53,789 --> 0:23:56,33
you're not even doing something
fancy, like you said earlier.


499
0:23:56,33 --> 0:23:58,871
Just something that you can wear
every day that will last you


500
0:23:58,871 --> 0:24:1,12
for years, that's going
to look beautiful on you.


501
0:24:1,12 --> 0:24:3,92
To do something well costs a lot
more than that, and especially


502
0:24:3,92 --> 0:24:8,38
if you're working on
a small batch sizes.


503
0:24:8,38 --> 0:24:10,64
And I think it's almost
similar to the model


504
0:24:10,64 --> 0:24:13,96
for organic small farms
going into the future.


505
0:24:13,96 --> 0:24:18,8
You can't compete with, like,
Monsanto-grown corn seed.


506
0:24:18,8 --> 0:24:23,65
It, for better or for worse,
is a certain kind of luxury.


507
0:24:23,65 --> 0:24:25,75
ALIA RAZA: And why
would you want to?


508
0:24:25,75 --> 0:24:28,6
I feel like I don't
think Tess wants


509
0:24:28,6 --> 0:24:31,16
to be making fast
fashion, and selling--


510
0:24:31,16 --> 0:24:32,8
CAROLINE POLACHEK:
[INAUDIBLE] money but you


511
0:24:32,8 --> 0:24:33,34
can't compete with those prices.


512
0:24:33,34 --> 0:24:34,166
ALIA RAZA: Oh, yeah.


513
0:24:34,166 --> 0:24:34,666
True.


514
0:24:34,666 --> 0:24:36,59
JULIE GILHART: I
think it's a decision


515
0:24:36,59 --> 0:24:41,39
if you want to be really big,
or if you just want to be big.


516
0:24:41,39 --> 0:24:45,31
I think that we have
a-- fashion has this,


517
0:24:45,31 --> 0:24:51,15
you just have to be-- to be
valid, you have to be huge.


518
0:24:51,15 --> 0:24:51,65
And--


519
0:24:51,65 --> 0:24:53,52
ALIA RAZA: Everybody has to know
who you are, and you have to--


520
0:24:53,52 --> 0:24:54,68
JULIE GILHART: Yeah.


521
0:24:54,68 --> 0:24:58,13
But I will tell you with
every single brand, that


522
0:24:58,13 --> 0:25:2,57
goes into that direction, it
does lose that connection,


523
0:25:2,57 --> 0:25:4,24
that personal connection.


524
0:25:4,24 --> 0:25:6,0
There's always a
brand connection,


525
0:25:6,0 --> 0:25:8,55
but I think the kind
of thing that you


526
0:25:8,55 --> 0:25:12,4
stand for, very
intimate collaborations.


527
0:25:12,4 --> 0:25:13,36
And you have a platform.


528
0:25:13,36 --> 0:25:15,36
Like you were saying,
you have social media.


529
0:25:15,36 --> 0:25:17,56
You can tell them exactly
what you're doing,


530
0:25:17,56 --> 0:25:20,93
and that's going to be
interesting, I think.


531
0:25:20,93 --> 0:25:24,38
TESS GIBERSON: And we do want
to be big, but with integrity.


532
0:25:24,38 --> 0:25:25,22
Don't get me wrong.


533
0:25:25,22 --> 0:25:28,33
We are very aggressive,
and we do want to grow,


534
0:25:28,33 --> 0:25:30,44
but we want to do it
always with integrity,


535
0:25:30,44 --> 0:25:33,37
always aligning ourselves with
projects that we believe in.


536
0:25:33,37 --> 0:25:35,68
We have, like, with
my partners we all


537
0:25:35,68 --> 0:25:38,27
have very core values
that we agree on.


538
0:25:38,27 --> 0:25:40,99
And so as we're growing
and we're always


539
0:25:40,99 --> 0:25:43,43
talking about where we're
going with the company,


540
0:25:43,43 --> 0:25:45,66
it's about maintaining
the integrity,


541
0:25:45,66 --> 0:25:48,56
maintaining what the
collection's about,


542
0:25:48,56 --> 0:25:50,24
what the feeling is about.


543
0:25:50,24 --> 0:25:51,75
And it's about
connecting directly


544
0:25:51,75 --> 0:25:54,28
with the women who are
wearing the clothes.


545
0:25:54,28 --> 0:25:56,625
Eventually, we want to do
men's, but right now it's


546
0:25:56,625 --> 0:25:57,25
just the women.


547
0:25:57,25 --> 0:26:0,55
So we're excited to
do that in the future.


548
0:26:0,55 --> 0:26:5,35
But it's really making sure that
everything that we're making,


549
0:26:5,35 --> 0:26:7,51
we believe in, we
would wear, we want


550
0:26:7,51 --> 0:26:9,181
to see other people wearing.


551
0:26:9,181 --> 0:26:10,93
There's a lot of thought
and consideration


552
0:26:10,93 --> 0:26:12,3
that goes into it.


553
0:26:12,3 --> 0:26:15,67
And I believe as we grow
we can maintain that,


554
0:26:15,67 --> 0:26:17,54
as long as that's
always important to us.


555
0:26:17,54 --> 0:26:19,839
JULIE GILHART: Do you
ever thing about Calvin?


556
0:26:19,839 --> 0:26:21,13
TESS GIBERSON: How do you mean?


557
0:26:21,13 --> 0:26:23,588
JULIE GILHART: Do you just ever
think about how he started,


558
0:26:23,588 --> 0:26:27,36
and how his business grew, and--


559
0:26:27,36 --> 0:26:29,19
TESS GIBERSON: Yeah, definitely.


560
0:26:29,19 --> 0:26:30,72
That's an amazing story.


561
0:26:30,72 --> 0:26:34,8
And I have a lot of respect,
so much respect for the way


562
0:26:34,8 --> 0:26:36,18
that he built his company.


563
0:26:36,18 --> 0:26:40,37
And that was a great
experience working there.


564
0:26:40,37 --> 0:26:42,57
It was such a good
foundation for me.


565
0:26:42,57 --> 0:26:44,88
And I love how
systematic, how clear,


566
0:26:44,88 --> 0:26:47,61
the marketing was brilliant.


567
0:26:47,61 --> 0:26:50,79
You knew when you walked
in where you were.


568
0:26:50,79 --> 0:26:55,49
And it was so thorough,
and I loved that.


569
0:26:55,49 --> 0:26:58,3
I loved that then and I still
love that way of doing things.


570
0:26:58,3 --> 0:27:1,82
And it really had a
huge impact on me,


571
0:27:1,82 --> 0:27:3,72
even though I after
wanted to do something


572
0:27:3,72 --> 0:27:6,55
super, super personal.


573
0:27:6,55 --> 0:27:10,68
Things I learned at Calvin, I
still work in that same way.


574
0:27:10,68 --> 0:27:14,87
There's some things I
just learned structurally


575
0:27:14,87 --> 0:27:18,35
that I still use when I'm
working-- the way I organize.


576
0:27:18,35 --> 0:27:21,937



577
0:27:21,937 --> 0:27:25,26
JULIE GILHART: Well,
we're going to have


578
0:27:25,26 --> 0:27:29,79
to continue this
conversation off-camera.


579
0:27:29,79 --> 0:27:35,36
But I think it's really,
really, really, really exciting.


580
0:27:35,36 --> 0:27:37,73
Really exciting.


581
0:27:37,73 --> 0:27:41,76
I think it's the most
exciting part of fashion.


582
0:27:41,76 --> 0:27:46,76
I have to say this one thing,
because I was in the fashion


583
0:27:46,76 --> 0:27:52,35
arena when they-- referring back
to the Antwerp Six, Margiela,


584
0:27:52,35 --> 0:27:55,33
Dries Van Noten,
Ann Demeulemeester.


585
0:27:55,33 --> 0:28:0,19
And they have those
same principles.


586
0:28:0,19 --> 0:28:4,3
And believe it or not, it
was like over 25 years ago.


587
0:28:4,3 --> 0:28:9,58
But they really-- and so
I think you, all of you


588
0:28:9,58 --> 0:28:11,442
all have like a
really bright future.


589
0:28:11,442 --> 0:28:12,9
ALIA RAZA: Those
were the designers


590
0:28:12,9 --> 0:28:14,83
that, when I was
a teenager, I used


591
0:28:14,83 --> 0:28:18,51
to pay attention to, and wish
I could buy those clothes,


592
0:28:18,51 --> 0:28:21,29
and save up money
for those clothes,


593
0:28:21,29 --> 0:28:28,53
and Margiela and [INAUDIBLE]
and Demeulemeester.


594
0:28:28,53 --> 0:28:32,687
So it makes sense
that you said that.


595
0:28:32,687 --> 0:28:34,2
JULIE GILHART: So thank you all.


596
0:28:34,2 --> 0:28:35,13
ALIA RAZA: Thank you.


597
0:28:35,13 --> 0:28:40,9
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you,
Julie, Tess, Alia and Caroline.


598
0:28:40,9 --> 0:28:45,76
We're going to now show Tess'
video for her spring, summer


599
0:28:45,76 --> 0:28:47,23
2014 collection.


600
0:28:47,23 --> 0:28:51,4
And then we're going to go into
10 minutes of Q&A. If anyone


601
0:28:51,4 --> 0:28:53,27
has any questions,
there's two mics.


602
0:28:53,27 --> 0:28:55,33
You can line up,
and after the video


603
0:28:55,33 --> 0:28:58,29
you can ask these folks any
questions that you may have.


604
0:28:58,29 --> 0:30:55,281
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]


605
0:30:55,281 --> 0:31:1,19
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]


606
0:31:1,19 --> 0:31:4,74
AUDIENCE: Hi, I have a
question for you guys.


607
0:31:4,74 --> 0:31:5,63
My name is Michael.


608
0:31:5,63 --> 0:31:8,506
I work here on the sales
side of the organization.


609
0:31:8,506 --> 0:31:10,63
And I don't know why I
introduced myself like that,


610
0:31:10,63 --> 0:31:12,77
because it has no
pertinence to my question.


611
0:31:12,77 --> 0:31:16,4
But I guess I would just love
to hear all of your takes


612
0:31:16,4 --> 0:31:21,74
on-- I think one of the things
I took away from your guys


613
0:31:21,74 --> 0:31:24,18
speaking about, sort
of, your philosophy


614
0:31:24,18 --> 0:31:28,77
and how you think
about collaborating,


615
0:31:28,77 --> 0:31:33,1
is maybe the idea that you want
people to come to your store


616
0:31:33,1 --> 0:31:37,11
or fashion or even
your video, and be


617
0:31:37,11 --> 0:31:39,49
able to express
themselves through sort


618
0:31:39,49 --> 0:31:43,47
of the blank canvas of your
style and of your fashion.


619
0:31:43,47 --> 0:31:49,72
And when I think about the
brands from yesteryear,


620
0:31:49,72 --> 0:31:52,86
all the big fashion brands
that you guys were also


621
0:31:52,86 --> 0:31:55,45
talking about, I think
there's something more


622
0:31:55,45 --> 0:31:59,7
about them wanting to gift
you with their perspective,


623
0:31:59,7 --> 0:32:4,31
or their brand, or their
personality, or the her, right?


624
0:32:4,31 --> 0:32:5,6
They want to give you the her.


625
0:32:5,6 --> 0:32:8,99
They want to make you the her,
by you exchanging with them


626
0:32:8,99 --> 0:32:10,21
and interacting with them.


627
0:32:10,21 --> 0:32:12,77
So I was wondering your
thoughts on that idea


628
0:32:12,77 --> 0:32:16,67
of the thirst for
self-discovery,


629
0:32:16,67 --> 0:32:18,52
even in the things
that we purchase.


630
0:32:18,52 --> 0:32:22,7
And not to be defined by
them, but to define ourselves


631
0:32:22,7 --> 0:32:25,7
in that process, and
maybe how you think about


632
0:32:25,7 --> 0:32:29,7
that in regards to your art,
and if that's sort of on point


633
0:32:29,7 --> 0:32:31,84
or not.


634
0:32:31,84 --> 0:32:33,48
TESS GIBERSON: What
I am always thinking


635
0:32:33,48 --> 0:32:35,92
about when I'm designing,
I want the clothes


636
0:32:35,92 --> 0:32:38,204
to become part of the
woman who's buying them.


637
0:32:38,204 --> 0:32:39,62
The woman who wears
the clothes, I


638
0:32:39,62 --> 0:32:44,37
want-- it's about bringing
her own personality out, not


639
0:32:44,37 --> 0:32:47,39
putting on to her anything else.


640
0:32:47,39 --> 0:32:50,29
But it's just like, when
I think about the clothes,


641
0:32:50,29 --> 0:32:53,18
it's about feeling
comfortable, confident,


642
0:32:53,18 --> 0:32:55,64
just bringing out your
own inner confidence.


643
0:32:55,64 --> 0:32:56,65
It's always about that.


644
0:32:56,65 --> 0:32:58,75
And to mix it however
the woman wants to,


645
0:32:58,75 --> 0:33:1,25
wear it however she wants to.


646
0:33:1,25 --> 0:33:4,69
That's a very big part
of actually how I design.


647
0:33:4,69 --> 0:33:8,8
And I think it's not
putting something onto them,


648
0:33:8,8 --> 0:33:12,74
but just bringing out
the strength inside.


649
0:33:12,74 --> 0:33:16,33
And it can be really subtle,
but it's always there.


650
0:33:16,33 --> 0:33:18,1
It's always something
I'm thinking about.


651
0:33:18,1 --> 0:33:19,9
And I love-- I see it.


652
0:33:19,9 --> 0:33:21,264
I see when the women
wear the clothes, that's


653
0:33:21,264 --> 0:33:22,68
actually something
that comes out.


654
0:33:22,68 --> 0:33:26,67
Because everything I do,
it's about feeling it's easy,


655
0:33:26,67 --> 0:33:28,86
it's comfortable, it's cool.


656
0:33:28,86 --> 0:33:32,92
And it's just about having
this inner confidence.


657
0:33:32,92 --> 0:33:34,81
CAROLINE POLACHEK:
Tess loaned me


658
0:33:34,81 --> 0:33:37,605
a couple looks on Trail
of Summer tour, one


659
0:33:37,605 --> 0:33:39,73
of which I found myself
going back to all the time.


660
0:33:39,73 --> 0:33:41,938
And not even just for stage,
but just for everything.


661
0:33:41,938 --> 0:33:44,316
And on the rack, it
looks like a white shirt


662
0:33:44,316 --> 0:33:45,94
with a bunch of
strings hanging off it,


663
0:33:45,94 --> 0:33:48,8
and a white skirt with a bunch
of strings hanging off it.


664
0:33:48,8 --> 0:33:48,88
And that's it.


665
0:33:48,88 --> 0:33:52,2
But when you put it
on, it's-- I mean,


666
0:33:52,2 --> 0:33:55,606
I know this kind of
idea of modular play,


667
0:33:55,606 --> 0:33:56,98
because it's in
a lot of things--


668
0:33:56,98 --> 0:34:0,26
in our actual websites
and furniture now.


669
0:34:0,26 --> 0:34:2,537
But it really
transformed characters.


670
0:34:2,537 --> 0:34:4,37
If I'd tie it one way
or tie it another way,


671
0:34:4,37 --> 0:34:7,37
it could look angelic
and straitjackety


672
0:34:7,37 --> 0:34:10,36
from one minute to another.


673
0:34:10,36 --> 0:34:12,326
And even leaving the
strings all hanging off


674
0:34:12,326 --> 0:34:14,659
was amazing for me, because
I play synthesizer on stage.


675
0:34:14,659 --> 0:34:16,242
And that is the most
boring instrument


676
0:34:16,242 --> 0:34:18,368
to watch anyone play in
the history of instruments.


677
0:34:18,368 --> 0:34:19,95
It's a person standing
at a rectangle.


678
0:34:19,95 --> 0:34:20,469
Great.


679
0:34:20,469 --> 0:34:22,87
But if I have a bunch of
strings hanging off me,


680
0:34:22,87 --> 0:34:25,429
every one of my emotions--
if I hit a chord,


681
0:34:25,429 --> 0:34:27,67
you see it translate [BRRRAHH]
into the entire thing


682
0:34:27,67 --> 0:34:28,58
I'm wearing.


683
0:34:28,58 --> 0:34:29,989
And that was really
exciting too.


684
0:34:29,989 --> 0:34:32,9
But ultimately, I could have
kind of laced it up nicely


685
0:34:32,9 --> 0:34:33,48
and gone out to dinner.


686
0:34:33,48 --> 0:34:37,4
And I think that kind of
sensitivity to the wearer


687
0:34:37,4 --> 0:34:39,81
is kind of what
Tess specializes in.


688
0:34:39,81 --> 0:34:42,792



689
0:34:42,792 --> 0:34:45,33
ALIA RAZA: I completely
agree with you.


690
0:34:45,33 --> 0:34:47,199
From all the clothes that
I have that Tess has made,


691
0:34:47,199 --> 0:34:48,32
I feel the same way.


692
0:34:48,32 --> 0:34:51,94
You can wear them in-- sometimes
you wear them in multiple ways


693
0:34:51,94 --> 0:34:54,139
and totally make them your own.


694
0:34:54,139 --> 0:34:56,59
In terms of my own
work, I don't think


695
0:34:56,59 --> 0:35:1,32
that I've thought much
about-- I mean making art,


696
0:35:1,32 --> 0:35:3,79
whether it's video art
or art objects-- I never


697
0:35:3,79 --> 0:35:7,15
think about how somebody's
going to make it their own.


698
0:35:7,15 --> 0:35:9,65
I'm just trying to
kind of impose my view,


699
0:35:9,65 --> 0:35:14,16
and give somebody an experience.


700
0:35:14,16 --> 0:35:18,95
But I've recently started
making perfume as well.


701
0:35:18,95 --> 0:35:23,59
And I think that's similar
to clothing, in that people


702
0:35:23,59 --> 0:35:25,48
wear perfume to
make it their own.


703
0:35:25,48 --> 0:35:27,86
They don't wear it--
people aren't really


704
0:35:27,86 --> 0:35:30,17
interested in
fragrance and scent


705
0:35:30,17 --> 0:35:33,8
as something that's
imposed on them.


706
0:35:33,8 --> 0:35:35,73
They want it to
become part of them.


707
0:35:35,73 --> 0:35:38,3
So it's like a whole
new thing to do.


708
0:35:38,3 --> 0:35:49,754



709
0:35:49,754 --> 0:35:52,46
AUDIENCE: You spoke a little
bit about pre-collections,


710
0:35:52,46 --> 0:35:56,42
and the role of having a
pre-collection that translates


711
0:35:56,42 --> 0:36:1,82
into a full line, fall
or spring collection.


712
0:36:1,82 --> 0:36:5,11
Tess, when you start designing
for one of your main seasons,


713
0:36:5,11 --> 0:36:6,9
where do you start?


714
0:36:6,9 --> 0:36:10,335
Like, what's step one
in your design process?


715
0:36:10,335 --> 0:36:12,89
TESS GIBERSON: I
always start, actually


716
0:36:12,89 --> 0:36:15,45
with a conversation
with my husband.


717
0:36:15,45 --> 0:36:20,44
We've-- honestly, since college,
we've been collaborating


718
0:36:20,44 --> 0:36:23,47
on just the ideas with
our work together.


719
0:36:23,47 --> 0:36:25,0
I talk to him about
his paintings,


720
0:36:25,0 --> 0:36:27,0
and he talks to me
about my collections.


721
0:36:27,0 --> 0:36:27,72
And we just talk.


722
0:36:27,72 --> 0:36:29,45
And it's through
talking and we kind of


723
0:36:29,45 --> 0:36:32,55
think about different
ideas, what we could do.


724
0:36:32,55 --> 0:36:34,85
So with the collections--
and I did this


725
0:36:34,85 --> 0:36:38,81
with my original collection--
and even when I worked at TSE,


726
0:36:38,81 --> 0:36:40,2
I worked this way.


727
0:36:40,2 --> 0:36:43,9
And now it's just like talking,
and kind of brainstorming


728
0:36:43,9 --> 0:36:46,51
what it could be, what
would be a fun collection


729
0:36:46,51 --> 0:36:47,24
to build off of?


730
0:36:47,24 --> 0:36:48,38
And what would the show be?


731
0:36:48,38 --> 0:36:51,63
And I think about
what the show might


732
0:36:51,63 --> 0:36:53,7
be when I'm starting
the collection.


733
0:36:53,7 --> 0:36:58,25
And then I usually start with
a word, an idea, a thought.


734
0:36:58,25 --> 0:37:0,33
And I take that and
I just brainstorm


735
0:37:0,33 --> 0:37:4,39
words from that, and
then ideas of what it


736
0:37:4,39 --> 0:37:7,17
could be in clothing,
and how can I bring those


737
0:37:7,17 --> 0:37:10,697
into details in the clothing,
and how could I build up


738
0:37:10,697 --> 0:37:12,28
a whole collection
around it, and then


739
0:37:12,28 --> 0:37:15,83
what would the show be,
the music, the feeling?


740
0:37:15,83 --> 0:37:17,51
So it's just a lot of words.


741
0:37:17,51 --> 0:37:22,77
And I kind of build trees off
of words, and that's my process.


742
0:37:22,77 --> 0:37:25,33
And I think I just,
sometimes I make it more


743
0:37:25,33 --> 0:37:27,8
elaborate than I need to.


744
0:37:27,8 --> 0:37:30,3
Because really, when it comes
down to it, it's a formula.


745
0:37:30,3 --> 0:37:33,68
You kind of know what your plan
is, you know what you need.


746
0:37:33,68 --> 0:37:36,3
But for me creatively
to maintain


747
0:37:36,3 --> 0:37:38,2
my love of what
I'm doing, I need


748
0:37:38,2 --> 0:37:43,43
to work like that, because
it's how I discover new--


749
0:37:43,43 --> 0:37:45,62
how do I come up with a
new shirt every season?


750
0:37:45,62 --> 0:37:48,62
I have to push myself
a little bit more.


751
0:37:48,62 --> 0:37:50,385
And it's fun.


752
0:37:50,385 --> 0:37:51,76
CAROLINE POLACHEK:
That makes you


753
0:37:51,76 --> 0:37:54,29
think about what Alia was
saying about spiders being


754
0:37:54,29 --> 0:37:56,28
a reference for her video.


755
0:37:56,28 --> 0:37:58,9
Because by the time
I saw the video,


756
0:37:58,9 --> 0:37:59,81
it was pretty close
to being completed.


757
0:37:59,81 --> 0:38:1,58
And I did not see
anything spidery in it,


758
0:38:1,58 --> 0:38:3,83
nor did I hear anything
spidery in the soundtrack.


759
0:38:3,83 --> 0:38:8,9
ALIA RAZA: But I asked you to do
something spidery, and you did.


760
0:38:8,9 --> 0:38:11,75
And then it kind of shifted
and turned into something else,


761
0:38:11,75 --> 0:38:13,27
but it-- go ahead.


762
0:38:13,27 --> 0:38:13,73
CAROLINE POLACHEK:
Well, what I mean


763
0:38:13,73 --> 0:38:15,51
is there's a process
of distillation.


764
0:38:15,51 --> 0:38:16,56
Like you were talking
about word trees.


765
0:38:16,56 --> 0:38:19,1
And I think often, when you're
chewing on the same idea


766
0:38:19,1 --> 0:38:21,16
and elaborating on it,
and trying to interpret it


767
0:38:21,16 --> 0:38:23,86
across so many different
kinds of media,


768
0:38:23,86 --> 0:38:27,44
you suddenly realize that
it's not the spider itself


769
0:38:27,44 --> 0:38:28,21
that you were interested in.


770
0:38:28,21 --> 0:38:31,35
Maybe it's the energy
of a way a spider moves,


771
0:38:31,35 --> 0:38:33,64
or it's that idea
of angles, or it's


772
0:38:33,64 --> 0:38:35,95
that idea of a thing
disseminating [INAUDIBLE] web.


773
0:38:35,95 --> 0:38:38,85
Or the kind of quiet
predator aspect of it.


774
0:38:38,85 --> 0:38:41,61
You find that there's like
a thing, a quality to it.


775
0:38:41,61 --> 0:38:43,8
And you could scrap
the spider idea


776
0:38:43,8 --> 0:38:44,64
and just go for that energy.


777
0:38:44,64 --> 0:38:47,33
And I feel like
that's what you're


778
0:38:47,33 --> 0:38:49,4
talking about when you're
going for the expanding


779
0:38:49,4 --> 0:38:50,81
from a single word.


780
0:38:50,81 --> 0:38:52,31
ALIA RAZA: And
that's what happened,


781
0:38:52,31 --> 0:38:54,93
because it went from-- I
think when you said, what


782
0:38:54,93 --> 0:38:56,48
are you thinking for the music,
and I said, I don't know,


783
0:38:56,48 --> 0:38:57,8
a spider.


784
0:38:57,8 --> 0:38:58,35
And you were like, OK.


785
0:38:58,35 --> 0:39:3,21
And then it turned into
kind of like more alien girl


786
0:39:3,21 --> 0:39:7,87
who crash landed onto a rooftop
in Brooklyn in the Apocalypse.


787
0:39:7,87 --> 0:39:10,85
And all of that is
very subtle, but that's


788
0:39:10,85 --> 0:39:13,15
what I was thinking of
when we were shooting it.


789
0:39:13,15 --> 0:39:13,65
Yeah.


790
0:39:13,65 --> 0:39:14,15
It switched.


791
0:39:14,15 --> 0:39:19,6



792
0:39:19,6 --> 0:39:22,27
CAROLINE POLACHEK: Don't be shy.


793
0:39:22,27 --> 0:39:24,11
ALIA RAZA: Ryan?


794
0:39:24,11 --> 0:39:25,802
Question?


795
0:39:25,802 --> 0:39:27,51
AUDIENCE: I just had
a question, in terms


796
0:39:27,51 --> 0:39:33,11
of how do you see your own
fashions evolving from what you


797
0:39:33,11 --> 0:39:34,76
were, say, 10 years back to now.


798
0:39:34,76 --> 0:39:36,46
Like, what's the
difference, even


799
0:39:36,46 --> 0:39:37,92
in terms of-- even your art.


800
0:39:37,92 --> 0:39:39,642
When you do
something, what do you


801
0:39:39,642 --> 0:39:42,15
compose maybe five years
back or two years back?


802
0:39:42,15 --> 0:39:43,27
How has it changed?


803
0:39:43,27 --> 0:39:45,311
And what do you feel are
some of the factors that


804
0:39:45,311 --> 0:39:48,355
contribute to this change?


805
0:39:48,355 --> 0:39:50,67
TESS GIBERSON: The
biggest change for me is,


806
0:39:50,67 --> 0:39:53,79
I always, originally I
felt this compulsion.


807
0:39:53,79 --> 0:39:55,38
I had to make it myself.


808
0:39:55,38 --> 0:39:58,87
And it was just like
crazy, very obsessive,


809
0:39:58,87 --> 0:40:3,5
like I had to put my hand on do
every single thing I produced,


810
0:40:3,5 --> 0:40:5,94
which was great in
the first two years


811
0:40:5,94 --> 0:40:8,65
when I was doing limited
edition-- was like smaller


812
0:40:8,65 --> 0:40:9,72
productions.


813
0:40:9,72 --> 0:40:14,876
Once I started producing,
selling more and more


814
0:40:14,876 --> 0:40:16,25
and the collections
were growing,


815
0:40:16,25 --> 0:40:17,23
there became a problem.


816
0:40:17,23 --> 0:40:22,82
Because it was like
physically killing me.


817
0:40:22,82 --> 0:40:24,97
And then I had my first child.


818
0:40:24,97 --> 0:40:27,342
And at that point I
realized, this is crazy.


819
0:40:27,342 --> 0:40:29,5
And I have to change
the way I'm working,


820
0:40:29,5 --> 0:40:31,49
because I can't keep
working this way.


821
0:40:31,49 --> 0:40:35,42
I mean I would literally
be working 16-hour days.


822
0:40:35,42 --> 0:40:39,46
And my husband has
his painting studio.


823
0:40:39,46 --> 0:40:40,39
We had a big loft.


824
0:40:40,39 --> 0:40:41,7
He painted one side.


825
0:40:41,7 --> 0:40:44,5
I had my sewing machines
on the other side.


826
0:40:44,5 --> 0:40:45,63
And we both just would work.


827
0:40:45,63 --> 0:40:47,6
Then when we had
our first child,


828
0:40:47,6 --> 0:40:50,2
we realized we
can't work this way.


829
0:40:50,2 --> 0:40:53,35
And so it was at that point
I was able to step back.


830
0:40:53,35 --> 0:40:55,63
And I took a few years,
I worked for TSE.


831
0:40:55,63 --> 0:40:58,454
And then when I restarted,
I knew the essence


832
0:40:58,454 --> 0:40:59,87
of what I wanted
to keep, and that


833
0:40:59,87 --> 0:41:4,59
was having integrity,
having the creative ideas,


834
0:41:4,59 --> 0:41:7,581
it was of the approach that
could keep the creativity,


835
0:41:7,581 --> 0:41:8,706
keeping the collaborations.


836
0:41:8,706 --> 0:41:11,5



837
0:41:11,5 --> 0:41:13,91
So there was a spirit
that was maintained.


838
0:41:13,91 --> 0:41:16,94
But I knew I didn't have
to make it any more myself.


839
0:41:16,94 --> 0:41:20,429
Wasn't about me making the
patterns, sewing the pieces,


840
0:41:20,429 --> 0:41:21,47
doing the hand stitching.


841
0:41:21,47 --> 0:41:24,39
I could step back and
give more direction,


842
0:41:24,39 --> 0:41:26,48
and tell other
people what I wanted,


843
0:41:26,48 --> 0:41:28,27
what I wanted it to look like.


844
0:41:28,27 --> 0:41:30,17
And actually, I could
be a lot more precise.


845
0:41:30,17 --> 0:41:34,94
And I could get more
of what I wanted,


846
0:41:34,94 --> 0:41:36,92
because I wasn't
making it myself.


847
0:41:36,92 --> 0:41:39,89
And that was a really
exciting and liberating point


848
0:41:39,89 --> 0:41:40,88
that I got to.


849
0:41:40,88 --> 0:41:44,13
So now, I can go through
the creative process,


850
0:41:44,13 --> 0:41:47,97
but I don't have to be-- it's
not as physically exhausting.


851
0:41:47,97 --> 0:41:51,83
And it's a lot more fun
that it was towards the end.


852
0:41:51,83 --> 0:41:57,966



853
0:41:57,966 --> 0:42:0,4
JULIE GILHART: Did
you have a question?


854
0:42:0,4 --> 0:42:1,105
OK, go ahead.


855
0:42:1,105 --> 0:42:2,813
AUDIENCE: Also, maybe
a selfish question.


856
0:42:2,813 --> 0:42:4,28
But you mentioned menswear.


857
0:42:4,28 --> 0:42:5,585
I'm just curious.


858
0:42:5,585 --> 0:42:7,46
I think there are
definitely some test givers


859
0:42:7,46 --> 0:42:9,16
and pieces that
I would wear now.


860
0:42:9,16 --> 0:42:14,32
But I'm curious how your designs
could translate to menswear.


861
0:42:14,32 --> 0:42:17,196
TESS GIBERSON: There's so many
pieces that I think already


862
0:42:17,196 --> 0:42:19,57
that I do in women's that
could just be modified a little


863
0:42:19,57 --> 0:42:20,7
for men's.


864
0:42:20,7 --> 0:42:21,197
ALIA RAZA: Even this.


865
0:42:21,197 --> 0:42:22,53
TESS GIBERSON: So yeah, exactly.


866
0:42:22,53 --> 0:42:25,75
There's a lot of and the
sweaters and the outerwear.


867
0:42:25,75 --> 0:42:28,9
When I was working at
TSE I was overseeing


868
0:42:28,9 --> 0:42:29,43
the men's collection.


869
0:42:29,43 --> 0:42:30,23
And I loved it.


870
0:42:30,23 --> 0:42:33,62
I loved working-- I think
because originally I


871
0:42:33,62 --> 0:42:34,62
started at Calvin Klein.


872
0:42:34,62 --> 0:42:38,13
I was in the men's collection,
designing sweaters.


873
0:42:38,13 --> 0:42:40,14
And there's something
about menswear


874
0:42:40,14 --> 0:42:43,42
that I really like a lot.


875
0:42:43,42 --> 0:42:46,14
I think that with my aesthetic,
what I do with women's, it's


876
0:42:46,14 --> 0:42:49,69
not such a stretch to be
able to modify it a bit.


877
0:42:49,69 --> 0:42:52,73
But I'm also not trying
to do everything at once.


878
0:42:52,73 --> 0:42:56,2
I'm trying to do it the right
way, with this relaunching


879
0:42:56,2 --> 0:42:57,78
the company with my partners.


880
0:42:57,78 --> 0:42:59,84
We have a plan of
how we want to grow.


881
0:42:59,84 --> 0:43:3,18
And we're right now just
working on really getting


882
0:43:3,18 --> 0:43:5,76
everything right with
the women's collection,


883
0:43:5,76 --> 0:43:9,12
the distribution, really
developing the collection,


884
0:43:9,12 --> 0:43:10,99
working with the customers.


885
0:43:10,99 --> 0:43:13,15
And we need to just get
a little bit bigger,


886
0:43:13,15 --> 0:43:15,85
so we can hire someone else.


887
0:43:15,85 --> 0:43:21,271
Because I don't want anymore
to work the 16-18 hour days.


888
0:43:21,271 --> 0:43:23,2
So I know what I want
it to be, and I also


889
0:43:23,2 --> 0:43:26,71
know the time I need to
allow to do it the right way.


890
0:43:26,71 --> 0:43:29,225
But it's absolutely
in the near future.


891
0:43:29,225 --> 0:43:33,212



892
0:43:33,212 --> 0:43:37,835
JULIE GILHART: So, all men
out there, come and see.


893
0:43:37,835 --> 0:43:39,47
ALIA RAZA: And then
we can do a video


894
0:43:39,47 --> 0:43:44,598
with cute boys
wearing cute clothes.


895
0:43:44,598 --> 0:43:47,42
JULIE GILHART: Are
all our dreams.


896
0:43:47,42 --> 0:43:50,84
So thank you for hosting this.


897
0:43:50,84 --> 0:43:52,38
Thank you for the introductions.


898
0:43:52,38 --> 0:43:54,82
Thank you, Google.


899
0:43:54,82 --> 0:43:57,465
Maybe you'll collaborate
with Google someday.


900
0:43:57,465 --> 0:44:0,382
TESS GIBERSON: Love to.


901
0:44:0,382 --> 0:44:1,59
ALIA RAZA: Thank you, Google.


902
0:44:1,59 --> 0:44:3,95
TESS GIBERSON:
Thank you, Google.


903
0:44:3,95 --> 0:46:3,95
