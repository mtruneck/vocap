###9 SHANE SMITH: We'd finally found our North Koreans deep
###11 in the bush and were busy talking to them when things
###13 started to get a bit hairy.
###15 
###19 Now these guys are coming back here.
###21 The dude with the crowbar is coming back.
###23 
###26 MALE SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###28 KIM YUN ZUN: [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###31 IGOR "THE FISH" RYBAKOV: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###33 SHANE SMITH: He says, what is that, your off switch?
###35 MALE SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###36 
###39 SIMON OSTROVSKY: He says I use it for fixing tractors.
###42 SHANE SMITH: I like the Fish more and more.
###43 He took the crowbar from him and said, what is that, your
###45 off switch?
###47 And two North Koreans came back.
###49 Now they're giving Mr. Kim shit.
###52 And they're quite angry.
###54 So we're probably going to have to get out of here.
###58 MALE SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###59 
###64 SHANE SMITH: And so, oh shit, here comes another truck.
###67 Now we're surrounded.
###68 They're got a truck up there.
###69 They've got a truck behind here.
###72 What'd he say?
###72 SIMON OSTROVSKY: He said he came to tell us that he
###74 doesn't want us filming anymore, and he's come to
###77 block the road.
###78 SHANE SMITH: Really?
###79 
###87 All right.
###88 Well, let's go find another crew.
###89 Let's go.
###91 The Fish is the boss.
###92 
###95 As the Fish took us further into the forest on these
###98 rutted dirt tracks, the atmosphere in the truck got a
###100 little bit goofy because of the lunacy that was being
###103 played out in the oddest game of low-grade cat and mouse
###106 I've ever seen.
###107 Ask about how we get home.
###110 We're in a high-speed car chase at five miles an hour
###114 through the wilds of Siberia.
###117 They're stopping, we go to try to pass them, and
###119 then they speed up.
###120 We sort of go on a side road, and then they head
###123 us off at the pass.
###124 It's a game of chicken out in the middle of nowhere.
###127 IGOR "THE FISH" RYBAKOV: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###129 
###135 SIMON OSTROVSKY: He was just telling us.
###136 KIM YUN ZUN: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###137 IGOR "THE FISH" RYBAKOV: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###138 SIMON OSTROVSKY: He says he's on their blacklist.
###140 SHANE SMITH: The Fish seemed tired of this game and
###142 suggested we pull over for some lunch, which consisted of
###145 paprika chips, bread, vodka, and a shotgun.
###149 
###151 IGOR "THE FISH" RYBAKOV: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN], cowboy.
###152 SHANE SMITH: Cowboy.
###153 SIMON OSTROVSKY: Cowboy.
###154 
###162 SHANE SMITH: The North Koreans are going-- what the fuck kind
###164 of journalists are these?
###166 Well, we found our North Koreans.
###167 Now let's get wasted and shoot off guns with the mafia.
###172 I hit it, but I didn't break it.
###174 [APPLAUSE]
###176 SHANE SMITH: It turned out there was method
###177 in the Fish's madness.
###178 Because our lunchtime shooting party seemed to have cowed the
###181 North Koreans just enough to get us out of the wilderness,
###184 which was very good because the all-menacing Siberian
###187 darkness was fast approaching.
###190 When we finally got to town, they, of course,
###193 were waiting for us.
###194 And the North Korean security dude just showed up.
###196 And he won't leave us alone.
###198 And he's just standing there trying
###199 to look at our passports.
###200 And trying to see all of our stuff.
###203 He's trying to be scary.
###204 SIMON OSTROVSKY: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###205 MALE SPEAKER 2: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###208 SHANE SMITH: And when we got on the train and said our
###210 teary goodbyes to the Fish, we realized that half the one-car
###212 train was our crew, and the other half were North Koreans.
###216 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###217 SIMON OSTROVSKY: That was the captain of the camp.
###219 SHANE SMITH: Great.
###219 So we locked ourselves into our compartment and spent the
###222 night backing up our hard drives and hiding all of our
###225 footage, which turned out be wise because we were met back
###228 in Tynda by the FSB, the local militia, the North Koreans,
###231 and some plainclothes detectives who promptly
###234 detained us.
###234 So they asked us a lot of questions.
###236 And they kept asking us about the pipeline.
###238 Are you here to shoot the pipeline?
###240 Are you here to shoot the pipeline?
###241 We were like, we don't know anything about a pipeline.
###242 We're here to shoot North Koreans.
###244 They knew about the Russian cop who had taken us to the
###247 North Korean camp.
###247 They knew about the chief of police in the north.
###249 Simon refused to be intimidated, and he said, if
###253 you want to ask any questions, ask me here.
###255 I'm not going with you.
###256 I'm not going away with you.
###257 They finally let us go.
###258 We freaked out a little bit, grabbed our
###260 stuff, and took off.
###262 We quickly hired a car and made a break
###264 for the Chinese border.
###265 When we finally got to the border, we realized that part
###268 of the reason for all this panic and fear on the North
###270 Korean and Russian side was that Kim Jong-Il, who almost
###273 never leaves North Korea, had secretly come to the same
###275 place we were, the Amur region of Russia, coincidentally at
###279 the exact same time we were there to hold talks with
###282 President Medvedev about more trade and labor agreements
###285 between the two countries.
###287 So this means that, while we were there, the Great Leader
###290 was selling even more of his people off, so he could make
###293 even more money, so you could make more weapons, so he could
###297 extort more food and aid and supplies from America and
###301 Japan, who he's technically still at war with.
###304 
###310 And this, better than almost anything I could think of,
###314 sums up the lunacy of the modern world.
###317 Thank you and goodnight.
