1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:3,44
this will show how to work the double crochet


2
0:0:3,44 --> 0:0:5,91
once you have completed the chain


3
0:0:5,91 --> 0:0:8,34
wrap the yarn over your hook


4
0:0:8,34 --> 0:0:10,51
skip three chains


5
0:0:10,51 --> 0:0:14,51
work the double crochet in the fourth chain


6
0:0:14,51 --> 0:0:16,38
insert your hook through the chain


7
0:0:16,38 --> 0:0:17,92
wrap the yarn over, pull it through


8
0:0:17,92 --> 0:0:20,42
there are three loops on the hook


9
0:0:20,42 --> 0:0:23,66
wrap the yarn over, pull through two loops


10
0:0:23,66 --> 0:0:27,29
wrap the yarn over, pull through two loops


11
0:0:27,29 --> 0:0:30,9
you have completed your first double crochet


12
0:0:30,9 --> 0:0:34,17
the beginning chain three will count as the first stitch


13
0:0:34,17 --> 0:0:35,97
that is something to keep in mind


14
0:0:35,97 --> 0:0:38,64
when you come back round on row two


15
0:0:38,64 --> 0:0:40,77
you will need to work a double crochet


16
0:0:40,77 --> 0:0:42,24
in top of the chain three


17
0:0:42,24 --> 0:0:45,21
so your stitch count is even on each row


18
0:0:45,21 --> 0:0:48,45
to work the next stitch, wrap the yarn over your hook


19
0:0:48,45 --> 0:0:50,58
put it through the next chain


20
0:0:50,58 --> 0:0:53,62
wrap the yarn over the hook, pull it through


21
0:0:53,62 --> 0:0:57,69
wrap the yarn over the hook, pull through two loops


22
0:0:57,69 --> 0:1:1,2
wrap the yarn over the hook, pull through two loops


23
0:1:1,2 --> 0:1:3,73
that completes the next double crochet


24
0:1:3,73 --> 0:1:6,3
wrap the yarn over your hook


25
0:1:6,3 --> 0:1:8,5
insert the hook through the next chain


26
0:1:8,5 --> 0:1:11,24
wrap the yarn over, pull it through


27
0:1:11,24 --> 0:1:14,47
wrap the yarn over, pull through two loops


28
0:1:14,47 --> 0:1:18,15
wrap the yarn over your hook, pull through two loops


29
0:1:18,15 --> 0:1:21,88
working the next double crochet, wrap the yarn over your hook


30
0:1:21,88 --> 0:1:29,66
put the hook through the next chain


31
0:1:29,66 --> 0:1:48,77
wrap the yarn over the hook, pull it through, there are three loops on the hook


32
0:1:48,77 --> 0:2:9,1
wrap the yarn over, pull through two loops


33
0:2:9,1 --> 0:2:22,54
wrap the yarn over, pull through two loops


34
0:2:22,54 --> 0:2:29,58
wrap the yarn over your hook


35
0:2:29,58 --> 0:2:37,62
put the hook through the next chain


36
0:2:37,62 --> 0:2:47,4
wrap the yarn over, pull it through


37
0:2:47,4 --> 0:2:49,5
there are three loops on the hook


38
0:2:49,5 --> 0:3:1,65
wrap the yarn over, pull through two loops


39
0:3:1,65 --> 0:3:14,96
wrap the yarn over, pull through two loops, to complete the double crochet


40
0:3:14,96 --> 0:3:18,7
the next few stitches will be worked in slow motion


41
0:3:18,7 --> 0:3:20,73
there will be no sound


42
0:3:20,73 --> 0:3:31,28
wrap the yarn over your hook 


43
0:3:31,28 --> 0:3:38,52
put your hook through the next chain


44
0:3:38,52 --> 0:3:46,36
wrap the yarn over, pull through the chain


45
0:3:46,36 --> 0:3:49,16
wrap the yarn over your hook


46
0:3:49,16 --> 0:3:58,24
pull through two loops


47
0:3:58,24 --> 0:4:7,58
wrap the yarn over


48
0:4:7,58 --> 0:4:12,79
pull through two loops


49
0:4:12,79 --> 0:4:15,99
that completes the double crochet


50
0:4:15,99 --> 0:4:20,56
wrap the yarn over your hook


51
0:4:20,56 --> 0:4:27,57
insert the hook through the next chain


52
0:4:27,57 --> 0:4:34,84
wrap the yarn over, pull through the chain


53
0:4:34,84 --> 0:4:39,55
wrap the yarn over the hook


54
0:4:39,55 --> 0:4:47,92
pull through two loops


55
0:4:47,92 --> 0:4:50,86
wrap the yarn over the hook


56
0:4:50,86 --> 0:4:55,56
pull the yarn through two loops


57
0:4:55,56 --> 0:5:0,6
that completes the double crochet


58
0:5:0,6 --> 0:5:3,64
wrap the yarn over your hook


59
0:5:3,64 --> 0:5:13,8
put the hook through the next chain


60
0:5:13,8 --> 0:5:14,41
wrap the yarn over the hook


61
0:5:14,41 --> 0:5:17,75
pull through the chain


62
0:5:17,75 --> 0:5:20,19
wrap the yarn over the hook


63
0:5:20,19 --> 0:5:25,99
pull through two loops


64
0:5:25,99 --> 0:5:28,36
wrap the yarn over


65
0:5:28,36 --> 0:5:36,24
pull through two loops


66
0:5:36,24 --> 0:5:39,17
that completes the double crochet


67
0:5:39,17 --> 0:5:41,58
we are at the last chain


68
0:5:41,58 --> 0:5:46,55
working the last double crochet


69
0:5:46,55 --> 0:5:49,15
of this row


70
0:5:49,15 --> 0:5:51,65
this is what it looks like


71
0:5:51,65 --> 0:5:54,2
we have ten double crochet


72
0:5:54,2 --> 0:5:58,96
this includes the beginning chain three, which will count as a stitch


73
0:5:58,96 --> 0:6:2,2
working a chain three


74
0:6:2,2 --> 0:6:5,5
this is the technique that is taught by many of the books


75
0:6:5,5 --> 0:6:9,5
I do have other tutorials with variations 


76
0:6:9,5 --> 0:6:12,67
showing how to work the step up, to the next row


77
0:6:12,67 --> 0:6:17,48
sometimes the chain may not give the edge a very neat appearance


78
0:6:17,48 --> 0:6:19,88
which is why you may want to use something different


79
0:6:19,88 --> 0:6:22,88
working the first double crochet


80
0:6:22,88 --> 0:6:24,42
wrap the yarn over the hook


81
0:6:24,42 --> 0:6:30,69
put the hook below the two loops at the top of the stitch


82
0:6:30,69 --> 0:6:32,36
just like that


83
0:6:32,36 --> 0:6:34,9
wrap the yarn over, pull it through


84
0:6:34,9 --> 0:6:37,3
there are three loops on the hook, wrap the yarn over


85
0:6:37,3 --> 0:6:40,23
pull through two loops, then two loops 


86
0:6:40,23 --> 0:6:41,8
this is what it looks like


87
0:6:41,8 --> 0:6:43,8
wrap the yarn over the hook


88
0:6:43,8 --> 0:6:47,24
put it below the two loops at the top of the stitch


89
0:6:47,24 --> 0:6:50,68
wrap the yarn over, pull it through, there are three loops on the hook 


90
0:6:50,68 --> 0:6:54,61
wrap the yarn over, pull through two loops


91
0:6:54,61 --> 0:6:57,85
wrap the yarn over the hook, pull through two loops


92
0:6:57,85 --> 0:7:0,15
wrap the yarn over the hook 


93
0:7:0,15 --> 0:7:3,59
put the hook below the two loops at the top of the stitch


94
0:7:3,59 --> 0:7:9,8
wrap the yarn over, pull through, there are three loops on the hook


95
0:7:9,8 --> 0:7:13,54
wrap the yarn over, pull through two loops


96
0:7:13,54 --> 0:7:17,54
wrap the yarn over, pull through two loops


97
0:7:17,54 --> 0:7:21,57
I will work the next few stitches in slow motion


98
0:7:21,57 --> 0:7:23,58
so there will be no sound


99
0:7:23,58 --> 0:7:27,35
wrap the yarn over your hook


100
0:7:27,35 --> 0:7:33,62
put your hook below the two loops at the top of the next stitch


101
0:7:33,62 --> 0:7:36,6
wrap the yarn over your hook 


102
0:7:36,6 --> 0:7:40,76
pull the yarn through


103
0:7:40,76 --> 0:7:43,0
there are three loops on the hook


104
0:7:43,0 --> 0:7:45,8
wrap the yarn over your hook


105
0:7:45,8 --> 0:7:51,71
pull through two loops


106
0:7:51,71 --> 0:7:54,27
wrap the yarn over your hook


107
0:7:54,27 --> 0:8:0,21
pull through two loops


108
0:8:0,21 --> 0:8:3,8
that completes the double crochet


109
0:8:3,8 --> 0:8:7,5
wrap the yarn over your crochet hook


110
0:8:7,5 --> 0:8:11,79
put your hook below the two loops at the top of the stitch


111
0:8:11,79 --> 0:8:17,23
wrap the yarn over, pull through the stitch


112
0:8:17,23 --> 0:8:19,57
wrap the yarn over the hook


113
0:8:19,57 --> 0:8:24,27
pull through two loops


114
0:8:24,27 --> 0:8:26,64
wrap the yarn over your hook


115
0:8:26,64 --> 0:8:31,28
pull through two loops


116
0:8:31,28 --> 0:8:35,22
wrap the yarn over your hook


117
0:8:35,22 --> 0:8:41,39
put your hook through the next stitch


118
0:8:41,39 --> 0:8:47,9
wrap the yarn over, pull through


119
0:8:47,9 --> 0:8:53,33
wrap the yarn over, pull through two 


120
0:8:53,33 --> 0:9:2,88
wrap the yarn over, pull through two


121
0:9:2,88 --> 0:9:9,18
wrap the yarn over your hook


122
0:9:9,18 --> 0:9:16,39
insert your hook through the next stitch


123
0:9:16,39 --> 0:9:23,3
wrap the yarn over the hook, pull through


124
0:9:23,3 --> 0:9:29,7
wrap the yarn over the hook, pull through two loops


125
0:9:29,7 --> 0:9:37,14
wrap the yarn over the hook, pull through two loops


126
0:9:37,14 --> 0:9:41,21
wrap the yarn over your hook


127
0:9:41,21 --> 0:9:46,59
put your hook through the next stitch


128
0:9:46,59 --> 0:9:50,89
wrap the yarn over, pull through the stitch


129
0:9:50,89 --> 0:9:56,73
wrap the yarn over, pull through two loops


130
0:9:56,73 --> 0:10:10,14
wrap the yarn over, pull through two loops


131
0:10:10,14 --> 0:10:15,35
we are at the edge, working the last double crochet


132
0:10:15,35 --> 0:10:17,78
this is working in the top of the chain


133
0:10:17,78 --> 0:10:20,42
when you look at the chain


134
0:10:20,42 --> 0:10:22,76
there are two loops at the top of the chain


135
0:10:22,76 --> 0:10:25,33
one loop on the back side


136
0:10:25,33 --> 0:10:30,26
I like to put my hook below the two loops


137
0:10:30,26 --> 0:10:32,53
at the top of the chain


138
0:10:32,53 --> 0:10:41,17
the one loop is at the back side


139
0:10:41,17 --> 0:10:45,45
wrap the yarn over, pull it through


140
0:10:45,45 --> 0:10:50,72
complete the double crochet


141
0:10:50,72 --> 0:10:53,35
and it goes through the chain, just like that


142
0:10:53,35 --> 0:11:1,3
work a chain three


143
0:11:1,3 --> 0:11:3,3
turn


144
0:11:3,3 --> 0:12:55,28
continue working the double crochet


145
0:12:55,28 --> 0:12:57,95
working the last stitch on the edge


146
0:12:57,95 --> 0:13:9,5
working the double crochet the same as the previous row


147
0:13:9,5 --> 0:15:9,5
that completes the double crochet
