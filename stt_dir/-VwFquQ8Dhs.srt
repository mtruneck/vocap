<i>The human brain is remarkable,</i>


2
0:0:5,927 --> 0:0:8,407
<i>For nine years</i>
<i>I thought I'd lost my watch</i>


3
0:0:8,407 --> 0:0:10,687
<i>cos I can't remember</i>
<i>which wrist it's on,</i>


4
0:0:10,687 --> 0:0:12,687
<i>And yet after two weeks</i>


5
0:0:12,687 --> 0:0:18,407
<i>the things that scared me at first</i>
<i>catheters chest tubes IVs,,,</i>


6
0:0:18,407 --> 0:1:21,927
<i>Everything has started to click,</i>


7
0:1:21,927 --> 0:1:25,887
Are you?
lf you have time to listen to music,


8
0:1:25,887 --> 0:1:37,327
then l assume you have time
to finish your paperwork.


9
0:1:37,327 --> 0:1:59,927
Keep moving.


10
0:1:59,927 --> 0:2:6,767
<i>That work day</i>
<i>started like every other,</i>


11
0:2:6,767 --> 0:2:10,927
- How's it goin'?
- l'm a 37-year-old janitor.


12
0:2:10,927 --> 0:2:12,407
How d'you think it's going?


13
0:2:12,407 --> 0:2:15,47
There is nothing wrong
with being a janitor.


14
0:2:15,47 --> 0:2:19,607
Really? Thank you,
you've turned my life around.


15
0:2:19,607 --> 0:2:24,167
l'll tell my janitor wife and all our
janitor kids that life is worth living.


16
0:2:24,167 --> 0:2:28,807
And that comes straight from our hero,
Dr Whozits, Dr Nothing.


17
0:2:28,807 --> 0:2:30,407
No, seriously, come on.


18
0:2:30,407 --> 0:2:34,607
Come over to my humble house and
point out things that are cheap.


19
0:2:34,607 --> 0:2:39,407
<i>Luckily I had the night off to regroup,</i>


20
0:2:39,407 --> 0:2:43,447
- That dog is creepy.
- Be nice to Rowdy.


21
0:2:43,447 --> 0:2:49,847
The guy we bought him from kept
him in a box full of old hats.


22
0:2:49,847 --> 0:2:51,927
Why is she here all the time?


23
0:2:51,927 --> 0:2:56,487
- Just give her a chance, man.
- You want to hit that.


24
0:2:56,487 --> 0:2:58,7
- No!
- Yeah!


25
0:2:58,7 --> 0:3:0,887
She's just a friend.


26
0:3:0,887 --> 0:3:5,807
lt's healthy, hanging out with a girl
without the ultimate goal being sex.


27
0:3:5,807 --> 0:3:11,847
- You know?
- l'm not following.


28
0:3:11,847 --> 0:3:14,847
Creepy. l had a run-in
with that nurse, Carla.


29
0:3:14,847 --> 0:3:18,327
She forgot to check the stats
on a patient and gave me attitude.


30
0:3:18,327 --> 0:3:20,127
Did you tell on her?


31
0:3:20,127 --> 0:3:24,807
- Who's responsible for this?
- She is.


32
0:3:24,807 --> 0:3:28,647
l don't remember.
Why do you assume it was my fault?


33
0:3:28,647 --> 0:3:32,7
<i>It'd be a good point except Elliot</i>
<i>puts her foot in her mouth,</i>


34
0:3:32,7 --> 0:3:34,887
<i>A lot,</i>
<i>She can't really seem to stop,</i>


35
0:3:34,887 --> 0:3:38,487
Just because l occasionally
say something stupid doesn't mean


36
0:3:38,487 --> 0:3:44,207
l go door-to-door annoying people,
like some crazed Jehovah's Witness.


37
0:3:44,207 --> 0:3:47,87
- You're not?
- No.


38
0:3:47,87 --> 0:3:50,767
My mother is.


39
0:3:50,767 --> 0:3:53,967
He's black, too.
You should tease him about that.


40
0:3:53,967 --> 0:3:58,87
<i>I'm doing better with new people,</i>
<i>Like Carla for instance,</i>


41
0:3:58,87 --> 0:4:5,527
Bambi, that blonde stick
you hang out with? Tell her...


42
0:4:5,527 --> 0:4:7,967
You might have to
write that down for me.


43
0:4:7,967 --> 0:4:11,727
<i>And Dr Cox, We've really connected,</i>
<i>I'm kind of like his protégé,</i>


44
0:4:11,727 --> 0:4:15,327
- l need to see his chart...
- Done, copied and highlighted.


45
0:4:15,327 --> 0:4:20,7
Unfortunately, radar,
l'm fresh out of gold stars.


46
0:4:20,7 --> 0:4:23,87
Multilobar pneumonia at 31 .
How much does he smoke?


47
0:4:23,87 --> 0:4:24,847
l don't know.


48
0:4:24,847 --> 0:4:29,847
lt's your attention to detail
that impresses me most.


49
0:4:29,847 --> 0:4:32,927
- How many packs a day, genius?
- Half a pack.


50
0:4:32,927 --> 0:4:35,927
l'm sorry.
l phrased the question wrong.


51
0:4:35,927 --> 0:4:38,367
How many packs a day, really?


52
0:4:38,367 --> 0:4:40,367
Eleven.


53
0:4:40,367 --> 0:4:42,567
You don't know where l'm coming from.


54
0:4:42,567 --> 0:4:45,487
Two or three packs.


55
0:4:45,487 --> 0:4:47,367
Let's hear it.


56
0:4:47,367 --> 0:4:52,407
l don't smoke so... Zero packs.


57
0:4:52,407 --> 0:4:54,287
What tests have you ordered?


58
0:4:54,287 --> 0:4:57,247
l was just...
l was totally kidding with you.


59
0:4:57,247 --> 0:4:59,447
He was. We're all in on it.


60
0:4:59,447 --> 0:5:3,87
<i>I like Will, That makes this harder,</i>


61
0:5:3,87 --> 0:5:6,327
l ordered blood cultures
and a high-resolution CT.


62
0:5:6,327 --> 0:5:10,767
What are you looking for?


63
0:5:10,767 --> 0:5:11,887
Cancer.


64
0:5:11,887 --> 0:5:15,527
<i>When you say ''cancer ''</i>
<i>every person reacts the same way,</i>


65
0:5:15,527 --> 0:5:20,47
- Excellent.
- <i>Not like that,</i>


66
0:5:20,47 --> 0:5:22,967
<i>There it is,</i>


67
0:5:22,967 --> 0:5:26,847
<i>I never know what to say to</i>
<i>Turk's buddies, But I'm getting better,</i>


68
0:5:26,847 --> 0:5:28,647
So...


69
0:5:28,647 --> 0:5:31,407
- How's surgery?
- lt rocks.


70
0:5:31,407 --> 0:5:36,87
But my bedroom, that's where
l really operate. Am l right?


71
0:5:36,87 --> 0:5:42,7
- Come on, show Todd some love!
- <i>I hate showing Todd love,</i>


72
0:5:42,7 --> 0:5:45,87
Bambi, why are you slumming
with these scalpel jocks?


73
0:5:45,87 --> 0:5:49,367
Please, baby.
This here's the VlP table.


74
0:5:49,367 --> 0:5:53,927
Why don't you
sit your fine self down?


75
0:5:53,927 --> 0:5:57,87
''Baby, this here's the VlP table...''


76
0:5:57,87 --> 0:5:59,487
l'm not really interested in her.


77
0:5:59,487 --> 0:6:7,767
Then the Todd'll show
that little biscuit some love.


78
0:6:7,767 --> 0:6:9,967
<i>Maybe he's a bit interested,</i>


79
0:6:9,967 --> 0:6:15,927
Fine. Todd'll show himself some love.


80
0:6:15,927 --> 0:6:18,47
l'm going to ask Carla out.


81
0:6:18,47 --> 0:6:22,7
- l think the janitor's out to get me.
- Thank you so much for your help.


82
0:6:22,7 --> 0:6:24,87
Why not be a bit more paranoid?


83
0:6:24,87 --> 0:6:32,607
- Wait, Turk...
- That's him.


84
0:6:32,607 --> 0:6:36,247
Hi, how are you?


85
0:6:36,247 --> 0:6:39,287
l need David Farr's chart.


86
0:6:39,287 --> 0:6:41,727
We all need lots of things.


87
0:6:41,727 --> 0:6:44,767
Great. Dr Kelso?
You're the Chief of Medicine.


88
0:6:44,767 --> 0:6:48,407
ls there a special way
to communicate with nursing staff?


89
0:6:48,407 --> 0:6:54,7
Sugar won't work.
They're already so sweet.


90
0:6:54,7 --> 0:6:57,47
Now, listen,
Dr Whatever-the-hell-your-name-is,


91
0:6:57,47 --> 0:6:59,487
you tattled yesterday, l responded.


92
0:6:59,487 --> 0:7:3,207
l feel closer to you than ever.
But the ramifications are yours.


93
0:7:3,207 --> 0:7:7,407
Don't drag me into your pathetic,
whiny, little squabble


94
0:7:7,407 --> 0:7:11,47
with that bunch of malcontents.
l hope you all kill each other.


95
0:7:11,47 --> 0:7:17,7
Have a great day, ladies.


96
0:7:17,7 --> 0:7:19,167
l hate this place.


97
0:7:19,167 --> 0:7:22,207
Dr Cox, l got Will's CT results back.


98
0:7:22,207 --> 0:7:25,87
No cancer.
So what shall l tell him?


99
0:7:25,87 --> 0:7:26,727
l'd open with that.


100
0:7:26,727 --> 0:7:30,327
He's headed down such a bad road,
maybe we could talk to him...


101
0:7:30,327 --> 0:7:34,367
<i>When you have a mentor you understand</i>
<i>the meaning behind their words,</i>


102
0:7:34,367 --> 0:7:37,767
- You do whatever you want.
- <i>Means ''Great idea'',</i>


103
0:7:37,767 --> 0:7:40,727
l'm just happy
you haven't messed up yet today.


104
0:7:40,727 --> 0:7:43,647
<i>Means ''You're really</i>
<i>coming along as a doctor'',</i>


105
0:7:43,647 --> 0:7:49,447
- Don't ever touch me.
- <i>Means ''Don't ever touch him'',</i>


106
0:7:49,447 --> 0:7:53,847
Just thought it was a nice moment.


107
0:7:53,847 --> 0:7:59,407
- l don't wanna.
- Come on.


108
0:7:59,407 --> 0:8:3,327
Carla, l shouldn't have
told Dr Kelso on you.


109
0:8:3,327 --> 0:8:7,287
No, you shouldn't have.


110
0:8:7,287 --> 0:8:9,327
<i>Comfortable silences,</i>


111
0:8:9,327 --> 0:8:13,527
But thank you for apologising.


112
0:8:13,527 --> 0:8:15,447
Good.


113
0:8:15,447 --> 0:8:19,727
- l wanna make one thing clear.
- Nothing needs to be clear.


114
0:8:19,727 --> 0:8:22,47
l still think you were in the wrong.


115
0:8:22,47 --> 0:8:27,847
Checking orthostatics is your job.
l need to know you'll take care of it.


116
0:8:27,847 --> 0:8:31,127
That's all l'm saying.


117
0:8:31,127 --> 0:8:35,367
There. All better.


118
0:8:35,367 --> 0:8:38,967
As of now,
you have no signs of cancer.


119
0:8:38,967 --> 0:8:41,327
Who rules? Will rules.


120
0:8:41,327 --> 0:8:43,767
This isn't great news.


121
0:8:43,767 --> 0:8:46,567
Are you sure?
That's how it first hit me.


122
0:8:46,567 --> 0:8:48,647
You're on a slippery slope.


123
0:8:48,647 --> 0:8:51,447
<i>I had to scare him but</i>
<i>I sensed he'd heard it before,</i>


124
0:8:51,447 --> 0:8:54,687
<i>Part of being a doctor</i>
<i>is your ability to improvise,</i>


125
0:8:54,687 --> 0:8:59,287
Right now, the one thing
l want you to think about...


126
0:8:59,287 --> 0:9:2,687
<i>How would you like to sound like this?</i>


127
0:9:2,687 --> 0:9:7,7
Let me see.


128
0:9:7,7 --> 0:9:9,967
- <i>This is so cool,</i>
- No, it's not.


129
0:9:9,967 --> 0:9:14,487
- <i>Biddy biddy biddy,</i>
- lt's not a toy.


130
0:9:14,487 --> 0:9:16,887
<i>Would you like to play a game?</i>


131
0:9:16,887 --> 0:9:19,407
<i>Sometimes</i>
<i>if all you have is old words</i>


132
0:9:19,407 --> 0:9:22,567
<i>all you can do is</i>
<i>hope they say something new,</i>


133
0:9:22,567 --> 0:9:25,767
Look, man. You're a great patient.


134
0:9:25,767 --> 0:9:28,287
l like you enough
to hope l never see you again.


135
0:9:28,287 --> 0:9:32,607
But if you keep smoking,
you'll be back here.


136
0:9:32,607 --> 0:9:38,127
l bet my own life on that.


137
0:9:38,127 --> 0:9:51,807
<i>Dr Reid to Room 402 then down</i>
<i>to 20 1 then back up to Room 403,</i>

139
0:9:53,887 --> 0:9:56,527
l'm your wing man.
l will not leave your side.


140
0:9:56,527 --> 0:10:0,487
- Hey, baby.
- Keep moving, frat boy.


141
0:10:0,487 --> 0:10:5,87
- Come on. Out with it.
- Don't rush me.


142
0:10:5,87 --> 0:10:6,807
l mean...


143
0:10:6,807 --> 0:10:12,87
You shouldn't be impatient
with the opportunity of a lifetime.


144
0:10:12,87 --> 0:10:18,287
l'm gonna sit down because
you're so sexy? My knees are weak.


145
0:10:18,287 --> 0:10:19,887
Really?


146
0:10:19,887 --> 0:10:21,967
Dr Cox?
l know l'm being annoying,


147
0:10:21,967 --> 0:10:24,407
but l'm getting used
to talking to patients.


148
0:10:24,407 --> 0:10:27,247
This is why l became a doctor, right?


149
0:10:27,247 --> 0:10:30,727
l heard, ''l know l'm being
annoying'' and then white noise.


150
0:10:30,727 --> 0:10:33,447
Will, l got him to quit smoking.


151
0:10:33,447 --> 0:10:36,967
For ever? No last one?
The last ones are better than sex.


152
0:10:36,967 --> 0:10:39,47
Trust me, l've had 1 ,000 of them.


153
0:10:39,47 --> 0:10:49,47
Done forever, he swore to me.
l reached him. l reached him.


154
0:10:49,47 --> 0:10:56,127
You're having a big day, there, Susan.


155
0:10:56,127 --> 0:11:4,167
Private party.


156
0:11:4,167 --> 0:11:7,167
<i>Gotta get right back on the horse,</i>


157
0:11:7,167 --> 0:11:9,247
- Dr Cox, about Will.
- Not now!


158
0:11:9,247 --> 0:11:12,727
l've a 1 0-minute break
and my soap is on.


159
0:11:12,727 --> 0:11:16,727
Hey, Skeech, if you go ahead
and change the channels,


160
0:11:16,727 --> 0:11:19,967
l swear l'll suture
your hands together.


161
0:11:19,967 --> 0:11:23,207
- Right. So with Will...
- This woman is just fantastic.


162
0:11:23,207 --> 0:11:27,887
The breasts are probably fake
but by God, those tears are real.


163
0:11:27,887 --> 0:11:35,527
<i>Time for a bold move,</i>


164
0:11:35,527 --> 0:11:38,47
How are we gonna fix this Will thing?


165
0:11:38,47 --> 0:11:41,7
Do you know what you've just done?


166
0:11:41,7 --> 0:11:43,447
You just lost all lapdog privileges.


167
0:11:43,447 --> 0:11:46,647
- Excuse me?
- No more walkies, no more treats,


168
0:11:46,647 --> 0:11:48,887
no more following me around.


169
0:11:48,887 --> 0:11:51,447
- l'm not your lapdog.
- You back there.


170
0:11:51,447 --> 0:11:54,727
What do we do with lapdogs
who can't behave in the house?


171
0:11:54,727 --> 0:11:56,807
Make them stay outside?


172
0:11:56,807 --> 0:11:59,447
You have five seconds
to get out of this room,


173
0:11:59,447 --> 0:12:2,807
or l'm gonna start whacking you
on the nose with this.


174
0:12:2,807 --> 0:12:5,407
Don't laugh, this isn't a joke. Get out.


175
0:12:5,407 --> 0:12:12,47
- But l was thinking...
- Go!


176
0:12:12,47 --> 0:12:14,247
What do you want to watch?


177
0:12:14,247 --> 0:12:19,207
- <i>Days of our Lives?</i>
- Attaboy.


178
0:12:19,207 --> 0:12:24,87
Come in.


179
0:12:24,87 --> 0:12:27,447
He smells the food.


180
0:12:27,447 --> 0:12:30,7
Move your butt.


181
0:12:30,7 --> 0:12:33,287
Peace offering?


182
0:12:33,287 --> 0:12:37,567
l know l don't always
make the best first impression.


183
0:12:37,567 --> 0:12:40,447
Or second, for that matter.


184
0:12:40,447 --> 0:12:45,7
l'd like us to be friends. l thought
l could get to know you a bit better.


185
0:12:45,7 --> 0:12:48,567
See what you're about.


186
0:12:48,567 --> 0:12:51,687
For instance,
when did you meet Morgan Freeman?


187
0:12:51,687 --> 0:12:55,127
That's my mom.


188
0:12:55,127 --> 0:13:0,647
l like her freckles.


189
0:13:0,647 --> 0:13:3,727
Rowdy, no!


190
0:13:3,727 --> 0:13:6,847
l can't figure out why
Dr Cox tore me a new one today.


191
0:13:6,847 --> 0:13:9,487
Enough already! He's a jerk.


192
0:13:9,487 --> 0:13:12,87
- He's a jerk.
- He's a jerk.


193
0:13:12,87 --> 0:13:14,687
- He's a jerk.
- You're a jerk.


194
0:13:14,687 --> 0:13:17,807
He's just Dr Cox.
He's always like that.


195
0:13:17,807 --> 0:13:20,607
Who really knows him?
Who does he hang out with?


196
0:13:20,607 --> 0:13:23,167
- No one.
- <i>That must be lonely,</i>


197
0:13:23,167 --> 0:13:26,847
''Take two Turks as needed,
apply to sensitive areas...''


198
0:13:26,847 --> 0:13:28,927
Who wrote this?


199
0:13:28,927 --> 0:13:33,647
Whassup?


200
0:13:33,647 --> 0:13:38,247
Come on, Carla. Give me one good reason
why you won't go out with me.


201
0:13:38,247 --> 0:13:41,407
You're a surgeon,
so you got the God complex,


202
0:13:41,407 --> 0:13:43,687
the ''married to the job'' thing.


203
0:13:43,687 --> 0:13:46,47
You're cute,
but you're very aware of it.


204
0:13:46,47 --> 0:13:50,287
You've no idea what l'm like, so your
feelings for me come from down there.


205
0:13:50,287 --> 0:13:53,367
But most of all,
l'm looking for the real thing.


206
0:13:53,367 --> 0:13:57,727
You're nothing but a little boy
who's not used to being told ''No''.


207
0:13:57,727 --> 0:14:1,807
So there's a bunch of reasons.
Pick your favourite.


208
0:14:1,807 --> 0:14:4,567
l'd go with the God complex.


209
0:14:4,567 --> 0:14:7,607
But it's hard to choose.
They're all so good.


210
0:14:7,607 --> 0:14:9,887
<i>A hospital is a tricky place,</i>


211
0:14:9,887 --> 0:14:12,847
<i>It's very cliquey</i>
<i>and you have to watch what you say,</i>


212
0:14:12,847 --> 0:14:37,567
<i>It's a lot like high school,</i>


213
0:14:37,567 --> 0:14:39,767
<i>If I didn't have</i>
<i>somewhere else to be</i>


214
0:14:39,767 --> 0:14:44,87
<i>I would have gone</i>
<i>and sat with her,</i>


215
0:14:44,87 --> 0:14:53,647
<i>But tonight there's somebody</i>
<i>else I have to take care of,</i>


216
0:14:53,647 --> 0:14:56,687
l know watching Will
kill himself hurts you, too.


217
0:14:56,687 --> 0:14:59,167
lt's harder if you have
no one to talk with.


218
0:14:59,167 --> 0:15:2,967
So l figured l'd pick up
a few cold ones, right?


219
0:15:2,967 --> 0:15:6,967
And you and l, we'll talk it out,
we'll just break the whole thing down.


220
0:15:6,967 --> 0:15:12,967
Right? What do you say to that?


221
0:15:12,967 --> 0:15:17,87
Everyone keeps ignoring me.
l'm like a plague around here.


222
0:15:17,87 --> 0:15:19,287
Don't look at me
when you're talking.


223
0:15:19,287 --> 0:15:23,847
Dr Reid. l just wanted to say,
you're out of my doghouse.


224
0:15:23,847 --> 0:15:27,527
That was a great catch
on that patient with meningococcus.


225
0:15:27,527 --> 0:15:31,207
That actually wasn't me.
Carla noticed the rash on his legs.


226
0:15:31,207 --> 0:15:34,687
You could have been
back into my good graces


227
0:15:34,687 --> 0:15:37,567
and instead you passed
the credit on to a nurse.


228
0:15:37,567 --> 0:15:42,407
How noble. l tell you what,
l'll get the cafeteria staff to write


229
0:15:42,407 --> 0:15:46,847
''Was it worth it?''
on a big cake for you.


230
0:15:46,847 --> 0:15:53,527
''...station''.
This is the nurses' station.


231
0:15:53,527 --> 0:15:58,207
- Do you think l've damaged ligaments?
- l don't care.


232
0:15:58,207 --> 0:16:2,207
Now, can l count on you
to never drop by here again?


233
0:16:2,207 --> 0:16:4,287
Or shall l just move?


234
0:16:4,287 --> 0:16:7,727
You can't leave a place
with this much warmth.


235
0:16:7,727 --> 0:16:13,167
l especially love this shelf filled with
photos of your friends and family.


236
0:16:13,167 --> 0:16:16,727
<i>If he comes at you</i>
<i>just try and roll out the door,</i>


237
0:16:16,727 --> 0:16:20,487
Actually, you have a point.


238
0:16:20,487 --> 0:16:24,87
l guess watching the game
by yourself with a Scotch


239
0:16:24,87 --> 0:16:28,247
isn't really the only way
to watch a game.


240
0:16:28,247 --> 0:16:34,767
lt's just that... l've always thought
of needing people as a sign of weakness.


241
0:16:34,767 --> 0:16:37,567
- lt's not.
- Well, then...


242
0:16:37,567 --> 0:16:40,887
Would you stay and
watch the game with me?


243
0:16:40,887 --> 0:16:44,567
Maybe have a slice of pizza?


244
0:16:44,567 --> 0:16:48,847
- Of course l will.
- l can braid your hair.


245
0:16:48,847 --> 0:16:52,887
l know the couch isn't very deep,
but we could move the back cushion


246
0:16:52,887 --> 0:16:56,167
and spoon.


247
0:16:56,167 --> 0:16:59,687
Hey, you guys, what do you say?
Beer and chips in the back.


248
0:16:59,687 --> 0:17:1,847
Just ignore them.


249
0:17:1,847 --> 0:17:4,127
Tell me the answer to this question.


250
0:17:4,127 --> 0:17:8,927
Do you want to be the big spoon
or the little spoon?


251
0:17:8,927 --> 0:17:11,767
Kelso didn't ask her,
she gave you full credit.


252
0:17:11,767 --> 0:17:16,487
l don't care. Too little too late.
Plus, l know why you're really here.


253
0:17:16,487 --> 0:17:20,127
So l'm gonna plop myself
right here in the VlP section,


254
0:17:20,127 --> 0:17:23,127
so you can give me what you got.


255
0:17:23,127 --> 0:17:26,367
l was gonna tell you
how l busted JD's chops the other day


256
0:17:26,367 --> 0:17:28,607
for wanting to be friends with a girl.


257
0:17:28,607 --> 0:17:31,847
And now l find it so amazing
to see how strong you are,


258
0:17:31,847 --> 0:17:33,927
how well you carry yourself,


259
0:17:33,927 --> 0:17:38,247
how l'd give anything to wake up
and watch you read the paper.


260
0:17:38,247 --> 0:17:41,287
But instead l think you should
hop off your broom,


261
0:17:41,287 --> 0:17:44,447
remember what it was like
when you first started here


262
0:17:44,447 --> 0:17:52,327
and give Elliot a break. Because she may
be a chore but she is a good person.


263
0:17:52,327 --> 0:17:55,647
And your ass is especially fine today.


264
0:17:55,647 --> 0:17:58,687
Pick me up tomorrow at seven.


265
0:17:58,687 --> 0:18:2,927
She's not the only one
who can do a speech. l can do a speech.


266
0:18:2,927 --> 0:18:8,767
Return that umbrella to me at
the hospital. Not here. ls that clear?


267
0:18:8,767 --> 0:18:11,7
And, Newbie...


268
0:18:11,7 --> 0:18:13,727
- Know what your problem is?
- My bones hurt?


269
0:18:13,727 --> 0:18:19,327
You were gonna rescue me from loneliness
with a $3 six-pack of light beer?


270
0:18:19,327 --> 0:18:22,647
lt turns out we can't
save people from themselves.


271
0:18:22,647 --> 0:18:26,367
We just treat 'em. Treat that kid
with a respiratory problem


272
0:18:26,367 --> 0:18:29,767
and when he comes back with cancer,
go ahead and treat that.


273
0:18:29,767 --> 0:18:33,327
Thanks for the pick-me-up.


274
0:18:33,327 --> 0:18:36,927
Smokers, drinkers, druggies,
fatties, whatever.


275
0:18:36,927 --> 0:18:44,87
lf you keep living and dying on whether
or not a person changes, well...


276
0:18:44,87 --> 0:18:50,47
You're not gonna make it as a doctor.


277
0:18:50,47 --> 0:18:55,887
Now come here and give me a hug.
lt's OK, come here.


278
0:18:55,887 --> 0:18:57,247
Get outta here!


279
0:18:57,247 --> 0:19:0,327
Take this piss water with you.
lt's embarrassing.


280
0:19:0,327 --> 0:19:5,7
- l'll drink it!
- l'll take the beer. You'll beat it.


281
0:19:5,7 --> 0:19:7,207
- You apologise.
- No, l don't wanna.


282
0:19:7,207 --> 0:19:11,807
OK, come on. Just do it really fast.
Like a Band-Aid.


283
0:19:11,807 --> 0:19:15,847
l wrote out the pharmacy renewals
on all your patients.


284
0:19:15,847 --> 0:19:21,287
Great. You know what else
would be helpful?


285
0:19:21,287 --> 0:19:24,527
<i>The one thing we never</i>
<i>stop looking for is acceptance,</i>


286
0:19:24,527 --> 0:19:26,847
- Thank you, Carla.
- You're welcome.


287
0:19:26,847 --> 0:19:29,287
<i>Acceptance of our own shortcomings,</i>


288
0:19:29,287 --> 0:19:32,367
- So when's the baby due?
- What baby?


289
0:19:32,367 --> 0:19:36,7
<i>Acceptance that some things</i>
<i>are gonna be what they're gonna be,</i>


290
0:19:36,7 --> 0:19:39,567
This is a strange resort.
The wheelchair service is great


291
0:19:39,567 --> 0:19:42,767
but that suite l rented,
there was another person in it.


292
0:19:42,767 --> 0:19:49,967
- And the bellhop gave me an enema.
- Yeah, he's new here.


293
0:19:49,967 --> 0:19:51,767
So...


294
0:19:51,767 --> 0:19:57,7
- Anything you wanna say?
- You know it all, man.


295
0:19:57,7 --> 0:19:59,87
<i>Still I hated Will a little</i>


296
0:19:59,87 --> 0:20:1,847
<i>cos I looked at people</i>
<i>who are important to me</i>


297
0:20:1,847 --> 0:20:4,127
<i>in terms of what</i>
<i>will probably kill them,</i>


298
0:20:4,127 --> 0:20:6,247
<i>Heart disease,</i>


299
0:20:6,247 --> 0:20:8,447
<i>Liver disease,</i>


300
0:20:8,447 --> 0:20:12,167
<i>Somebody choking her,</i>


301
0:20:12,167 --> 0:20:14,367
<i>I don't know,</i>


302
0:20:14,367 --> 0:20:21,287
<i>Probably stress,</i>


303
0:20:21,287 --> 0:20:23,727
- Say anything else to him?
- No.


304
0:20:23,727 --> 0:20:25,807
But you wanted to.


305
0:20:25,807 --> 0:20:28,687
- You told me not to.
- Would you be a man?


306
0:20:28,687 --> 0:20:37,487
Stick to your convictions
or you'll never make it as a doctor.


307
0:20:37,487 --> 0:20:39,727
l can't believe your head exploded.


308
0:20:39,727 --> 0:20:42,447
lf it does,
you'll never make it as a doctor.


309
0:20:42,447 --> 0:22:42,447
l mean, come on.
You look ridiculous.
