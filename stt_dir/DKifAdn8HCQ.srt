1
0:0:0,4 --> 0:0:4,85
thirty one-year-old woman in ireland
uh... died after she had a miscarriage


2
0:0:4,85 --> 0:0:9,74
and doctors refuse to terminate the
pregnancy uh... when she was about


3
0:0:9,74 --> 0:0:13,44
seventeen weeks pregnant she went into
the hospital and complained about severe


4
0:0:13,44 --> 0:0:14,749
back pain


5
0:0:14,749 --> 0:0:19,589
and the doctors realized that she was
miscarrying so she started asking them


6
0:0:19,589 --> 0:0:24,48
after an abortion because the pain was
excruciating however out the fetus


7
0:0:24,48 --> 0:0:26,289
allegedly still had a heart beat


8
0:0:26,289 --> 0:0:30,96
and uh... the doctors told her that they
would not uh... abort because they only


9
0:0:30,96 --> 0:0:35,86
abort in cases where the woman's life is
in danger


10
0:0:35,86 --> 0:0:38,56
and so they they had not heard the
abortion


11
0:0:38,56 --> 0:0:40,48
uh... few days later


12
0:0:40,48 --> 0:0:43,89
uh... it she died from something known
is that set the senior


13
0:0:43,89 --> 0:0:48,85
and uh... it was a yuko live uh...
infection that she had


14
0:0:48,85 --> 0:0:54,19
and you know she left behind a husband
and their devastated and the fact that


15
0:0:54,19 --> 0:0:57,38
doctors denied her this abortion


16
0:0:57,38 --> 0:0:58,7
is just


17
0:0:58,7 --> 0:1:0,66
ridiculous it's ludicrous


18
0:1:0,66 --> 0:1:1,479
yet in


19
0:1:1,479 --> 0:1:4,98
this is a problem when we make decisions
like this


20
0:1:4,98 --> 0:1:6,63
uh... that are not based


21
0:1:6,63 --> 0:1:8,76
on logical reason


22
0:1:8,76 --> 0:1:12,68
or even honest the humanity of the
people say they do this for morality is


23
0:1:12,68 --> 0:1:16,75
this for al is this moral miss the
muslim world we have ever heard doctor


24
0:1:16,75 --> 0:1:18,21
saying that they won't


25
0:1:18,21 --> 0:1:21,51
operate when she obviously even she was
vomiting proper


26
0:1:21,51 --> 0:1:26,12
whole day she was an extreme pain
obvious issue has and we pay


27
0:1:26,12 --> 0:1:29,86
long infection in the beginning to our
meeting today in the right before so for


28
0:1:29,86 --> 0:1:30,55
us


29
0:1:30,55 --> 0:1:33,72
but that by the end of the baby was in a
survive anyway


30
0:1:33,72 --> 0:1:38,57
she asks for an abortion multiple times
and he she was desperate at one point


31
0:1:38,57 --> 0:1:40,99
com she was fully dilated


32
0:1:40,99 --> 0:1:44,63
uh... and and feed the miscarriage it
shoes in the process of having a


33
0:1:44,63 --> 0:1:49,11
miscarriage and she asked for them to
you know opal abort you know get get


34
0:1:49,11 --> 0:1:50,52
this out of my body


35
0:1:50,52 --> 0:1:54,26
uh... and the doctors told her it only
take a few minutes just you know just


36
0:1:54,26 --> 0:1:55,4
wait it out


37
0:1:55,4 --> 0:1:59,34
uh... as she was you know japan meeting
and the arctic fluid it was an issue


38
0:1:59,34 --> 0:2:4,5
isn't horrible condition and they still
denied what she asks for and out her


39
0:2:4,5 --> 0:2:8,92
husband says that doctors told her uh...
i'm sorry the doctor said that you know


40
0:2:8,92 --> 0:2:10,919
this is a catholic hospitals


41
0:2:10,919 --> 0:2:14,29
and that's what the long island that's
the law yeah


42
0:2:14,29 --> 0:2:18,58
uh... and at the husband says i had
neither irish nor catholic


43
0:2:18,58 --> 0:2:21,79
but they said there was nothing they
could do


44
0:2:21,79 --> 0:2:23,579
this vessel exactly what's wrong with
this


45
0:2:23,579 --> 0:2:26,65
why are you putting your morality on me


46
0:2:26,65 --> 0:2:28,36
begin this to my wife


47
0:2:28,36 --> 0:2:29,869
hinman


48
0:2:29,869 --> 0:2:33,379
curious i'm furious and it is that my
wife


49
0:2:33,379 --> 0:2:37,19
why do why i have to listen to your
insane rules


50
0:2:37,19 --> 0:2:42,12
from new orleans is taxed well i think
that no one should marketing handle


51
0:2:42,12 --> 0:2:46,1
religion was fall it's that's what's out
there we would do


52
0:2:46,1 --> 0:2:48,31
for western democracies assault


53
0:2:48,31 --> 0:2:50,69
believe in that is just


54
0:2:50,69 --> 0:2:53,5
this barbarism when you see the actual
effects of it


55
0:2:53,5 --> 0:2:57,23
you know oftentimes when we talk about
extremism we talk about countries in the


56
0:2:57,23 --> 0:3:0,94
middle east but when you look at some of
the laws that island house when it comes


57
0:3:0,94 --> 0:3:3,2
to contraception when it comes to you


58
0:3:3,2 --> 0:3:7,25
abortion you realize just how religious
there really are


59
0:3:7,25 --> 0:3:11,27
for instance it wasn't until nineteen
eighty five that ireland allowed uh...


60
0:3:11,27 --> 0:3:17,89
people over the age of eighteen to
purchase condoms without a prescription


61
0:3:17,89 --> 0:3:22,289
contraband completely until about
nineteen seventy nine on cell n and


62
0:3:22,289 --> 0:3:26,59
recently what relatively recently in two
thousand five


63
0:3:26,59 --> 0:3:30,309
three women now filed a lawsuit against
ireland because they have to travel out


64
0:3:30,309 --> 0:3:34,179
of the country to receive an abortion so
understand because that sounds really


65
0:3:34,179 --> 0:3:35,29
confusing


66
0:3:35,29 --> 0:3:38,739
are they supposed to be a billboard
generally not get the life is in danger


67
0:3:38,739 --> 0:3:41,0
as it was in this case and we started
talking about


68
0:3:41,0 --> 0:3:44,839
well that's the problem according to the
constitution abortion is


69
0:3:44,839 --> 0:3:46,3
flat out the legal


70
0:3:46,3 --> 0:3:48,78
but in nineteen eighty two supreme court
ruled that


71
0:3:48,78 --> 0:3:52,369
it could be legalized the situation one
woman's lives at risk


72
0:3:52,369 --> 0:3:55,519
if you continue the pregnancy the
problem is nobody knows how to interpret


73
0:3:55,519 --> 0:3:56,11
that


74
0:3:56,11 --> 0:3:57,86
this for that's conflicting


75
0:3:57,86 --> 0:4:1,48
and so some hospital say well no we're
not gonna do the work no matter what


76
0:4:1,48 --> 0:4:3,149
some hospitals do


77
0:4:3,149 --> 0:4:6,79
that's nowhere to run a country and that
not only is that no way to run the


78
0:4:6,79 --> 0:4:8,479
country apples completely


79
0:4:8,479 --> 0:4:14,62
and against your pro-life stance because
women are dying as a result of your


80
0:4:14,62 --> 0:4:16,859
refusing to terminate


81
0:4:16,859 --> 0:4:19,62
uh... a pregnancy you know i've done up


82
0:4:19,62 --> 0:4:21,85
fears that is not viable


83
0:4:21,85 --> 0:4:24,749
right fears that isn't even gonna
survive


84
0:4:24,749 --> 0:4:28,289
you know it like in this case they know
that she is going through a miscarriage


85
0:4:28,289 --> 0:4:32,189
so you're not saving anyone's life in
this situation but in this case i think


86
0:4:32,189 --> 0:4:36,469
the doctors were so afraid of breaking
the law that they decided to play it


87
0:4:36,469 --> 0:4:40,34
safe and just not do anything about it
army go further i think uh...


88
0:4:40,34 --> 0:4:42,69
for the most religious people


89
0:4:42,69 --> 0:4:44,939
that take it for this kind of extreme
ravine most


90
0:4:44,939 --> 0:4:47,18
the moral people


91
0:4:47,18 --> 0:4:48,229
in the world


92
0:4:48,229 --> 0:4:54,9
and so it's not like already religion
and its morality or dividend or they're


93
0:4:54,9 --> 0:4:55,999
just the same as there is no doubt


94
0:4:55,999 --> 0:4:57,65
they're not the same as everybody's


95
0:4:57,65 --> 0:5:1,56
when you takes stupid laws that don't
meet any sense


96
0:5:1,56 --> 0:5:4,669
that our team in your bible it doesn't
even say you should have an abortion


97
0:5:4,669 --> 0:5:5,629
your bible


98
0:5:5,629 --> 0:5:9,27
anne apply to everybody what they are in
your religion about your religion


99
0:5:9,27 --> 0:5:13,289
whether a group and they don't agree and
some people dying because of it that's


100
0:5:13,289 --> 0:5:17,129
is the moral of act as you could
possibly do and why


101
0:5:17,129 --> 0:5:18,62
because law an auto


102
0:5:18,62 --> 0:5:22,889
some and purpose in teen sixteen hundred
years ago made a political document


103
0:5:22,889 --> 0:5:26,77
that he said jesus might have said
o_j_'s of those friends might have said


104
0:5:26,77 --> 0:5:29,5
before that he has been swept this
assaults


105
0:5:29,5 --> 0:5:31,21
don't they


106
0:5:31,21 --> 0:5:36,129
there in the pump daring leonard i like
that and now we have these neanderthals


107
0:5:36,129 --> 0:5:40,78
in america that want to take us back to
me is dark in the thousands nobel's


108
0:5:40,78 --> 0:5:42,729
across the country


109
0:5:42,729 --> 0:5:44,86
walk back


110
0:5:44,86 --> 0:5:46,539
reproductive rights


111
0:5:46,539 --> 0:5:49,969
i can't believe we're having this comes
as it did so many states


112
0:5:49,969 --> 0:5:52,71
their weight


113
0:5:52,71 --> 0:5:55,26
i'm so sick of people's religion then


114
0:5:55,26 --> 0:5:57,69
and so sick of it


115
0:5:57,69 --> 0:6:1,949
and possibly know you have to do my
review that do my religion


116
0:6:1,949 --> 0:6:3,11

have a conversation about haiti


126
0:6:28,56 --> 0:6:32,99
update here as a result


127
0:6:32,99 --> 0:6:35,459
basis for this law ok fine don't talk
about it


128
0:6:35,459 --> 0:6:39,32

135
0:6:57,569 --> 0:6:59,99

0:6:59,99 --> 0:8:59,99
fundamentalist bullshit
