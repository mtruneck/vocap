###17 JESSE HUGHES: When you think about rock and roll, and you
###19 think about the road, you're thinking about a mystical,
###21 mythical place that seems like everybody in the whole world
###24 dreams about being on, but nobody really
###26 knows what it's about.
###28 Legalize it.
###29 Don't criticize it, you know what I'm saying?
###31 
###35 Those who do go down that road soon come to a realization at
###39 their life that it's the place they always knew they should
###41 be, and the place they always wanted to be, even
###44 before they knew it.
###45 She loves me not.
###46 She loves me.
###47 She loves me not.
###47 She loves me.
###49 I believe the most thankless element of the rock roadie
###51 must truly exist within the metal world.
###54 The harbingers of the strip club and the strip pole, and
###56 the true strokers of the self ego.
###58 We're going to go to the Golden God Awards and see how
###61 much they truly love the road hero that they
###64 sing so much about.

###89 JESSE HUGHES: Yeah, so I realize that turning up to a
###90 parade of '80s rockers wearing a "Legalize Gay" shirt could
###93 be a little close to the bone, so I switched to something a
###96 little more appropriate.
###97 [MUSIC CONTINUES]
###107 JESSE HUGHES: Now this is supposed to be heavy metal.
###109 Is that William Shatner?
###110 Is that his toupee as well?
###111 It's William Shatner and his toupee.
###114 Would you like to see a reward recognizing the meritorious
###117 achievements of the road crew?
###119 SEBASTIAN BACH: What a-- look.
###120 You just gave me fucking chill bumps, dude.
###122 JESSE HUGHES: Oh, thanks.
###122 SEBASTIAN BACH: Cause that would be really cool.
###125 You know, the bands make it rock, but the
###126 crews make it roll.
###128 CHRIS JERICHO: Without a good road crew, you
###129 don't have a good band.
###129 I mean, that's the truth.
###130 That's why bands like Maiden have had their same crew for
###134 like 20 years.
###135 MALE SPEAKER: It'd be like Elton John going
###137 out without a toupee.
###138 You couldn't do it.
###139 CHRIS JERICHO: You just couldn't--
###139 [LAUGHTER]
###141 DAVID COVERDALE: Oh, are you kidding me?
###141 They're the cowboys of the 21st century.
###144 Totally.
###144 ROBB FLYNN: That would be a good award.
###145 DAVE MCCLAIN: It would be a sleazy award, I would imagine.
###149 JESSE HUGHES: The road crew members are what we're
###151 doing a story on.
###152 Do you have any experiences with road crew that you would
###154 like to tell us about?
###154 JENNA HAZE: With road crew?
###156 I don't-- like, you mean like the roadies and stuff?
###158 JESSE HUGHES: Yes.
###160 SEBASTIAN BACH: [MAKES HORN SOUND WITH MOUTH]
###164 DEZ FAFARA: They're more important than anything.
###165 They get up while we're sleeping.
###166 JESSE HUGHES: Have you ever killed any hookers and used
###168 the road crew to hide the body?
###169 DEZ FAFARA: No.
###170 JESSE HUGHES: Have you ever attempted to kill any member
###172 of a road crew, or has any member of a road crew
###174 attempted to kill you in any way, shape or form?
###176 JENNA HAZE: No, not at all.
###177 I have good security, so.
###179 SEBASTIAN BACH: [SINGING]
###181 Like what note--you know--
###182 JESSE HUGHES: Yeah, what the fuck is going on?
###183 SEBASTIAN BACH: What note is this?
###185 JESSE HUGHES: How do you feel about the
###185 road crew in general?
###187 TAYLOR MOMSEN: Fantastic
###187 FRANK BELLO: I used to be a road crew.
###188 I used to be a roadie for Anthrax before
###189 I got in the band.
###190 So I relate, brother.
###191 It's all good.
###192 VINCE NEIL: There are so many guys that
###195 could win this award.
###196 SHAWN CRAHAN: They actually work harder than
###197 the band, you know?
###198 So much respect to all those people.
###201 STEVEN ADLER: The band don't play unless
###203 there's a road crew.
###204 Road crew eats first.
###205 VINNIE PAUL: The road crew really is the unsung heroes of
###207 everything, man.
###208 And without them this doesn't happen, you know?
###210 So we appreciate them, and we always made them part of our
###213 families, part of our home videos, and it
###215 really was our family.
###217 JESSE HUGHES: Well I think we've learned that the metal
###218 gods truly love their boys of the road crew.
###222 Machismo in the brodeo goes without saying.
###224 There's a little bit of a broner.
###225 And I saw a big broner in the metal scene
###227 for their road crew.
###228 But you know what?
###230 We're not getting the whole picture yet.
###231 We need to uncover the rock and let the
###233 cockroaches run free.
###235 [ROCK MUSIC]
###238 JESSE HUGHES: So we've caught wind, and in our scent is now
###241 Mr. Hickey himself.
###243 He is one of the last, and a true god of
###245 the road crew scene.
###246 This man has seen it all.
###247 He's been naked with Nick Oliveri on stage, and he's
###250 swapped heroin with more junkies and trannies than
###253 anybody would ever care to know.
###255 I'm going to take you all to see the Hickey.
###257 Now the Hickey, he's gonna leave more than a mark.
###260 JEF HICKEY: My first day on the road?
###262 Well, it was Megadeth, and it was in Providence, Rhode
###264 Island, [GRUNTING].
###265 And--
###266 [GRUNTING]
###268 near the end of the night, they asked me if I wanted to
###271 go with them.
###272 I said, can I go home and get some clothes?
###274 And they said, no, we don't have time for that.
###275 You got to come with us now.
###277 So I left with the clothes on my back, and then that night I
###280 was sleeping in the back of a Ryder truck, cradling a
###283 shotgun, laying on top of Marshall cabinets.
###286 It was the ultimate life-altering decision that
###289 changed everything.
###291 I don't think I slept the whole tour.
###293 It was--
###293 I absorbed everything.
###295 I did every drug for the first time on that tour.
###298 I saw my first, like, nine guys fucking one chick, and
###302 then throwing her out of the Winnebago.
###304 And then I had my first taste of speed.
###306 And then my first taste of coke.
###309 I fucked a stripper with a broken leg in the ass in
###311 Mississauga, Ontario, at the Coronet Motor Hotel.
###314 
###317 JESSE HUGHES: Hickey is a slippery snake.
###319 I had to get my grips on him outside a tattoo parlor, and I
###322 ended whipping him and his tattooist back to my place.
###325 Hickey reveals one of the uncompromising facts of the
###328 rock world.
###329 If you love it, it will twist you and leave its
###330 mark upon your body.
###331 JESSE HUGHES: Put it anywhere?
###332 JEF HICKEY:Yeah, right there.
###333 JESSE HUGHES: You can't fall asleep without the rumble of a
###334 tour bus or without being wedged between two flight
###336 cases in an uncomfortable position
###338 at a midnight airport.
###341 You just wanted to go where the rock was, see your
###343 favorite brands and you saw, wow, if I do this, I get to be
###346 where the rock is, right?
###346 JEF HICKEY: Yup.
###347 JESSE HUGHES: And then next thing you know you're in a
###349 fucking Ryder truck with a shotgun.
###350 JEF HICKEY: Shotgun.
###351 Protecting the gear.
###352 Scared out of my fucking mind.
###354 I was with of my favorite thrash metal bands, and I was
###356 in awe, because I was working with Dave Mustaine and--
###359 JESSE HUGHES: And you went for it.
###360 Never looked back.
###361 JEF HICKEY: Never looked back.
###361 DAVE MUSTAINE: It's real!
###362 Fuck, it's real!
###363 MALE SPEAKER: Two, two.
###364 Hey, yeah, two, two two.
###367 JEF HICKEY: And then it was just kind of word of mouth.
###369 I went from Megadeth to Celtic Frost, to Nuclear Assault, to
###374 Samhain, to Danzig, to Tora Tora.
###376 I just get jumping from band to band.
###377 
###380 I did Mariah Carey.
###381 I did Madonna.
###382 I learned with Billy Joel that if the red cup was in the
###386 dressing room, that meant Christie's not coming.
###388 Put booze in there.
###389 But if there was a blue cup, that meant Christie's coming.
###391 They're better be water in every cup.
###395 And Luther Vandross would FedEx his toilet
###397 seat ahead of time.
###398 And we would have to install his toilet seat, so that when
###401 Luther came in, he would sit on his toilet
###402 seat, and it was his.
###405 I did Lemmy from Motorhead.
###406 I got the Maker's Mark ready at the end of the night, with
###409 the cigarette going.
###410 I had to hand him both.
###411 I was a glorified waiter, is what I was.
###413 But man, it was the best cigarette I've ever lit.
###416 And it was the greatest drink I've ever poured.
###417 And I did it every night.
###419 And I was looking forward to that moment, because I knew I
###422 had made it through another war day.
###424 And he didn't break a string, and he wasn't giving me that
###427 dirty look, or he wasn't screaming about this or that.
###430 It was awesome.
###431 He was just--
###432 it was great.
###433 JESSE HUGHES: So I want hear this burger story.
###436 JEF HICKEY: I make it across the border.
###439 I'm out of it.
###440 I've been up for three days.
###441 And I'm fucking hungry.
###442 And Phil--
###443 the guitar player from Motorhead-- tells me that
###445 there's some burgers on the bus, and I should go have one.
###448 So I go into the bus, and I grab the burger off the plate,
###452 and everybody's looking at me.
###454 And it's just one of those moments where you're like,
###455 wait, something's not right.
###457 I go to bite, and then I realize it's a patty of shit.
###461 JESSE HUGHES: I personally have seen people walk off the
###463 stage for far less.
###465 JEF HICKEY: Sure.
###465 I've had guitars broken across my leg.
###467 I had an SG thrown at me.
###469 I've been hit with mic stands.
###470 I've been kicked.
###471 Yeah, I was just kinda caught in the line of fire.
###474 I'm the guy.
###475 JESSE HUGHES: This is a calling, almost.
###477 JEF HICKEY: Oh no, dude, I would do anything for the
###480 show, dude.
###481 Anything for the show.
###482 Because every show that I went to, some guy put it on.
###485 And that show changed my life.
###487 So I'm hoping that the show that I helped put on changes
###490 some other kid's life.
###491 And then he's the next Lemmy, or the next Josh, or the next
###494 Nick, or whoever.
###496 JESSE HUGHES: That sums it up, right there.
###498 But would you recommend this?
###500 And if you would, who would you recommend it to, and what
###502 would you recommend?
###503 JEF HICKEY: I'm not here to tell anybody what to do,
###505 'cause I didn't want anybody telling me what to do.
###506 But it's a lot of fun, man.
###509 It's a great fucking existence.
###511 I got to some really great shows.
###512 I got to meet a lot of cool people.
###515 I got to fuck a lot of amazing chicks that normally wouldn't
###517 even serve me dinner.
###519 So.
###520 JESSE HUGHES: Any regrets?
###522 JEF HICKEY: Uh, wow.
###523 Yeah, herpes.
###524 
###527 Herpes.
###528 
###530 That's it.
###531 JESSE HUGHES: There's a phrase often said that if you can't
###533 do the crime, do not do the time.
###536 Rock and roll is a beautiful and amazing vicious animal,
###538 but it takes no prisoners, and it will leave
###540 its mark upon you.
###541 It's definitely not for those who want to lead the
###543 disciple's life of Christ.
###545 And it's certainly not for people trying to save whales
###547 or stop global warming.
###549 In order to be alive in the belly of the whale, you have
###552 to be just as mean.
###554 If not meaner.
###555 JEF HICKEY: that's--
###556 [LAUGHS]
###557 that feels fine.
###560 [LAUGHING/CRYING]
###564 I just really miss my mom, right now.
###566 Simultaneously, just coincidentally at the same
###569 time that this tattoo's happening.
###571 You know, and I'm just thinking about,
###573 like AIDS and cancer.
###574 Just makes me sad.
###575 [LAUGHTER]
