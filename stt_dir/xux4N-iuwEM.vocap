###5 Something new is happening on planet Earth,
###9 big enough to be seen from space.
###13 Hot spots, buzzing with the energy of millions of people.
###20 For the first time in human history, more of us live in cities than in the country.
###26 But these are cities on a different scale.
###30 In just 50 years, we've seen the birth, the growth
###35 and now the dominance of the megacity.
###43 Sprawling, seething, noisy, polluted,
###47 crammed with 10 million, 15, sometimes even 30 million people.
###53 These cities are complicated, fragile places,
###58 constantly on the edge.
###62 These are places of overcrowded squalor.
###68 But these are also the most exciting places on the earth.
###73 Brim with optimism and fun and energy.
###76 Hey! HE GRUNTS
###79 Love them or loathe them, fear them or embrace them,
###83 the megacities are the human future of the planet.
###91 We have, at the last count,
###93 created 21 of these extraordinary urban sprawls.
###97 Pulsing and beating entities, giant organisms in their own right.
###103 And these cities and our experience of them
###107 is shaped by how we move around them.
###110 Total chaos! I would call it anarchy,
###113 but that would be extremely unfair on anarchists.
###116 In this film, I'm going to be asking how our megacities can survive
###120 without having a colossal heart attack.
###123 Motorways, the freeways, the railways below us
###127 are the veins and the arteries.
###130 But all round the world, these arteries are getting clogged up and congested.
###135 They're gobbling ever more resources...
###139 That's some cow!
###141 ..and dumping grotesque amounts of waste.
###146 So, how does the metropolis deal with all the stuff its people don't want?
###151 Solid fat!
###154 Now I want to wipe my nose but, on the whole, I think I won't.
###158 And what length do people go to
###160 to stop the modern metropolis from drowning in its own excess?
###164 It's unimaginable, what he's just lowered himself into.
###183 Why are our great cities where they are
###187 and why are they the shape they are?
###191 All around the world,
###192 you see the same pattern.
###195 Coastlines and river mouths.
###198 And there's no mystery
###199 in why the great cities love to dangle their feet in the water.
###204 Because throughout history,
###206 sea lanes and rivers were the original superhighways
###211 and even today, it's transport - that basic need to get in and out -
###218 that shapes and stretches
###221 and sometimes even strangles the cities of the world.
###240 How to move millions of people around a megacity 24 hours a day,
###244 without bringing the place to a shuddering halt
###247 and without literally choking its citizens to death,
###250 is one of the major challenges we will face in the 21st century.
###258 I'm starting this journey in one of the poorest,
###261 most chaotic and overcrowded cities of them all -
###264 Dhaka in Bangladesh.
###269 There's simply no money for fancy subways or slick freeways here.
###274 And with a population of 13 million, and rising, to shunt around,
###277 Dhaka is feeling the squeeze.
###284 People still have to move around. Whatever it takes.
###289 And it's hot, intense and rather dangerous.
###295 Every great city depends entirely on its transport system.
###300 But if there's one choke point all round the world, it's the morning rush hour,
###305 when millions upon millions of people
###308 struggle to get to their jobs
###310 and, seemingly, will do almost anything to make it in.
###316 The megacities are the most extreme example of this,
###321 and the poorer ones the most extreme of the extreme.
###329 There are so many people trying to move around this dense city
###333 that it feels like there isn't a rush hour, because the entire day is one massive rush hour.
###338 A rush day.
###339 With just two train lines to serve a population the same size as London's,
###344 and only one major highway,
###346 the result is predictable mayhem.
###351 So, how can you get around a city of 13 million people effectively?
###356 Actually, it's using one of the most primitive modes of modern transport,
###361 pedal power.
###363 Because Dhaka is the rickshaw capital of the world.
###367 Noisy, stinking, slow
###371 and extremely dangerous.
###374 CAR HORNS BEEP
###376 But for most people around the world
###379 this is the reality of urban transport,
###383 not some dinky high-speed train.
###389 There are well over half a million rickshaws in downtown Dhaka,
###393 that's roughly one for every 20 people.
###396 Hardly surprising, then, that 80 percent of all male newcomers to Dhaka
###401 start out as one of these human taxis.
###404 They work ten hours a day, seven days a week,
###408 pulling some seriously heavy loads.
###411 And so, as a new arrival, I think it only right I should have a go.
###417 Now, I'm a keen cyclist in London, so how hard can this really be?
###422 MAN SPEAKS BENGALI
###425 TRANSLATION: It isn't the traffic. He's saying it's difficult to ride in a...
###430 Straight line? Yeah. Yeah.
###432 What are the most important rules of the street?
###435 TRANSLATOR SPEAKS BENGALI
###440 The brake is the most important thing. The brake's the most important thing, OK.
###444 Is it as easy as riding a bike?
###447 THEY CHATTER IN BENGALI
###457 I think that means it's not as easy as riding a bike!
###461 Here I go.
###467 HE LAUGHS
###469 Hey! HE GRUNTS
###475 CHILDREN CHEER
###482 Apparently, there are 600,000 of these in the city.
###488 And I'm beginning to get a sense
###491 of how much human horsepower
###493 it takes to move Dhaka around.
###511 I'm supposed to keep to the left, but it's so crowded here
###515 I'm being forced into the middle of the road.
###518 And with a cab on the back, it's difficult to judge exactly how tight a gap I can squeeze through.
###524 Oh, my God! Oh, I'm sorry.
###527 Oh, I'm sorry.
###528 What you soon realise is, you can never get up a good head of steam.
###532 You're constantly stopping and starting.
###536 And it's far harder and much more exhausting than it looks.
###541 That was both great fun and really, really hard work.
###546 More difficult than it seems.
###549 I had a great time doing it for about 20 minutes, but I think that's about my lot.
###553 These guys do it for, what, ten hours at a time or more?
###558 It's astonishing.
###559 They're said to be as fit as Olympic athletes
###562 and I have to say, I can well believe it.
###565 Thank you. OK. Thanks, guys.
###570 But Dhaka's reliance on rickshaws
###572 means more than simply back-breaking labour
###575 for tens of thousands of its citizens.
###577 It also affects the shape of the city.
###580 Because if your only means of getting around is by rickshaw,
###584 then you are restricted to travelling fairly short distances.
###588 Which means, in turn,
###590 that Dhaka is one of the most densely-populated metropolises in the world.
###596 If you look at the map of any old city and see how it grows,
###601 you can see that it expands in concentric rings as the transport gets better.
###607 From horses to bicycles,
###609 to cars and trams and trains and metro,
###613 the bigger the rings, the more effective the transport.
###616 There's one very simple truth...
###621 The better the transport, the bigger the city can grow.
###625 And today's megacities have taken that simple truth
###629 and pushed it to the absolute extreme.
###635 London. One of the planet's first great metropolises.
###639 With a population of 13 million, including all its surrounding areas,
###643 this city was built not on roads but on steel.
###648 In the early 19th Century,
###650 London was 30 times smaller than it is today.
###655 With only horsepower to move its people around, it simply couldn't get any bigger.
###660 And then a revolutionary new form of transport started to reshape this great metropolis
###665 and all of Britain's other big cities.
###669 The oldest megacities, like London, were only ever able to gobble up the land around them
###674 thanks to whizzy new technologies like the train.
###678 As the tendrils of train and tram networks spread out from the centre,
###683 the suburbs followed and the population mushroomed.
###686 And just when it looked as if the train companies couldn't demolish any more houses
###690 to build any more lines,
###692 they had another bright idea - to go under the houses instead.
###700 From the opening of the first underground station in 1863,
###704 in just 40 years, the population trebled to six million.
###710 London's roots would become criss-crossed by a web of tunnels,
###714 transporting more than 2.5 million people every day.
###720 It was revolutionary.
###723 And in the 150 years or so since then,
###726 the London Underground has hugely expanded
###729 and been rebuilt and patched up and grown and copied.
###732 But everything has its limits.
###736 The number of people you can squeeze through these tubes
###740 has now reached its maximum.
###745 It's a bit as if you were given one pair of trousers for life
###751 at the age of 12.
###753 You get bigger and bigger
###756 and, first of all, the trousers start to squeeze a little bit
###760 and then it's a really painful squeeze.
###764 Well, this wonderful piece of world-breaking technology
###769 has now become London's painful squeeze.
###778 That is the problem with these arteries of megacities.
###781 Very easily, they become crammed and sclerotic
###784 and they're on the edge of collapse again.
###787 The men who built the London Underground thought they had their city sorted.
###791 Nothing lasts forever.
###793 Success sucks in many more people
###796 until it starts to feel like failure.
###799 That doesn't stop people on the other side of the world trying just the same thing,
###803 though bigger and faster than London.
###810 This is the Shanghai Metro.
###814 20 years ago, Shanghai didn't have an underground at all.
###818 Now it boasts the largest one in the world,
###821 and they've built it at an awesome speed.
###829 TRANSLATION: The total soil excavated after completion of the networks
###833 will be around 22 million tonnes,
###835 including all the soil that needs to be dug out of the stations.
###839 22 million tonnes!
###846 I'm very proud of what we've done.
###848 In the last few years, we've managed to complete the same length of lines
###852 that it's taken 100 years for foreigners to build.
###855 It's a great method of transport.
###862 I'm sure London's engineers were just as confident all that time ago.
###866 But the Chinese Government haven't stopped with a mere subway.
###869 They've spent well over a billion pounds
###872 on a revolutionary new overground train system
###875 known as the Maglev.
###877 These trains, built in Germany, have no wheels.
###880 Using magnetic levitation,
###883 they literally float along the track at extraordinary speeds.
###888 We're doing 380 kilometres an hour.
###892 385. 388. 390.
###896 400 kilometres an hour.
###900 425, six, seven.
###902 431. We're now doing more than 431 kilometres an hour.
###907 I think that's about 270 miles an hour.
###910 This thing is flying.
###913 It makes a British InterCity train look like a horse and cart.
###922 And just as the tubes reshaped London,
###925 it's thought that these super-fast services
###928 will reshape this entire area of China.
###936 It's too soon to say
###939 how Maglev trains might reshape China,
###943 but experts are already talking about giant urban areas
###949 of perhaps 100 million people each.
###954 This is how futuristic transport
###957 can entirely reshape the way we think now about cities.
###966 Then again, I'm not so sure.
###970 People's dreams of futuristic freedom
###972 rarely pan out the way that's expected,
###975 and there's no clearer example of that
###977 than what's become the true curse of the megacity the world over -
###982 the humble car.
###985 And the people of Shanghai are in love with that.
###990 In China, just 25 years ago, private cars were banned.
###996 Now they're joining the roads of Shanghai alone
###1000 at the rate of 1,000 every day.
###1003 And China has become the largest car market in the world.
###1015 Meet Shanghai citizens, Wenbing Wu and his wife Jee Chen.
###1020 They've come to the BYD, or Build Your Dream, car showroom in Shanghai
###1026 to take a look at a new motor.
###1029 This would be the first vehicle that they, or any of their family, have ever owned.
###1034 As far as I'm concerned, they have no idea of what they're letting themselves in for.
###1041 TRANSLATION: We had to save every month. We've been saving up for a really long time.
###1047 Wenbing and Jee are typical of the megacity-dwelling Chinese.
###1051 The thing about cars, is that they are just so appealing.
###1056 Who would want to sit on a sweaty subway
###1059 or cram into a crowded bus when you can cruise in air-conditioned comfort?
###1064 For many of us, commuting by public transport
###1067 is such a gruelling experience
###1070 that getting a private car is a tempting alternative.
###1073 But this is about more than just getting from A to B.
###1076 It's about status.
###1079 Now, in a place like Shanghai,
###1081 having a shiny new car of your own shows that you have made it.
###1087 For this couple, it's clearly cost them a lot,
###1090 but they seem convinced that their new car's going to be worth it.
###1096 Now we've managed to get a car, all of my family are really happy about it.
###1100 It's like you've realised what you've been dreaming about for so long.
###1105 So all of us are really happy.
###1111 If only we could take them by the hand and lead them to the streets of...
###1116 Mexico City, say.
###1123 For this really is a city built on tarmac.
###1128 Here there are almost 20 million people
###1130 and nearly five million cars.
###1136 Traffic here is so heavy
###1138 that commuters can spend six hours a day, a third of their waking lives,
###1145 sitting in their cars
###1147 just trying to get to work.
###1149 This is transport not just shaping the megacity,
###1152 it's in danger of killing it.
###1162 The motorways, the freeways, the railways below us
###1166 are the veins and the arteries of any city.
###1171 We're in Mexico City, one of the most congested places on the planet.
###1175 These arteries are getting clogged up and congested.
###1179 And we know what happens if you get too much of that.
###1184 You get an urban heart attack.
###1188 Mexico City's traffic cops are fighting a war, and they are not winning.
###1199 I'm with the police helicopter pilot Captain Oscar Cardenta
###1203 to get a whirlybird's-eye-view of the morning commute.
###1209 Just 7:30am. Already jams are forming down below,
###1213 and they stretch as far as we can see.
###1218 Right now, we're going to be coming up on, uh,
###1222 on Periferico, which is usually very busy at this time of day.
###1226 Mexico City's Periferico is the city's major ring road.
###1229 If anything goes wrong here, the police know it will spawn rush-hour hell.
###1235 How can you help from the air? I have a traffic specialist
###1239 and he's giving orders to the people on the ground
###1242 to detour the traffic, control the flow.
###1246 It isn't long before Oscar spots trouble.
###1248 Something's slowing down the traffic on a critical flyover.
###1252 Left unchecked, this could spell gridlock, so he's straight onto it
###1255 and a team of motorbike traffic police are despatched.
###1262 They're going to need to act quickly
###1264 because any hold-ups can degenerate into city-wide chaos.
###1269 This time, it just turns out to be a broken-down car.
###1272 The young couple driving it have simply run out of petrol.
###1280 No hanging around for the AA here.
###1282 So dire is the congestion, that in Mexico City
###1286 the police have learned to improvise.
###1294 Unconventional, but it works.
###1301 So if we're all going to live in the megacity, and it rather looks like most of us will,
###1306 are we all condemned to a future of choking jams and sweat-packed tube trains?
###1313 No, I think that maybe we don't want to turn our backs on our low-tech past.
###1318 Maybe Dhaka and its half a million cycle rickshaws
###1324 does have something to teach us.
###1328 Across the globe
###1330 and London is gearing up for a three-speed revolution.
###1339 To get real change in the city, you need two things.
###1342 You need pent-up demand on the streets and you need proper leadership.
###1346 When the two come together, change can happen very, very fast.
###1350 A good example would be the London bicycle scheme.
###1355 When this got going...
###1359 ..a lot of people said, "It's not going to work,"
###1361 and within the first ten weeks there were a million journeys made.
###1365 # I seen you riding around The streets at night
###1369 # On your bicycle #
###1372 There's no single magic bullet that's going to solve the megacity transport crisis.
###1377 We have to snaffle ideas from all over the place,
###1381 taking smaller, smarter solutions
###1383 which, when you take them together, can have an impact.
###1386 London's first large-scale public bike-hire scheme
###1389 is part of that potential mix.
###1397 In the economy of the great cities,
###1401 they're always learning and copying and stealing from each other.
###1405 And it's not just from the hi-tech cities.
###1408 So Dhaka in Bangladesh may be a nightmare,
###1411 but it's a nightmare run on pedal power
###1415 and that's something that modern cities are re-learning.
###1418 And so to have a transport system that really works you need everything.
###1423 You need the taxis and the cars and the buses.
###1428 You need the trains and you need bicycles
###1432 and, of course, decent places to be able to walk safely, as well.
###1437 It's a bit like fusion food, you know, that we eat all the time.
###1442 You bring in all sorts of lessons, all sorts of flavours
###1448 and you mix them up
###1449 and with a bit of luck and leadership,
###1452 you get a city that's moving again.
###1459 This is an example of how the megacity can function at its best.
###1464 A bit of technological innovation, some risk,
###1467 fingers crossed, and openness to what's worked elsewhere.
###1472 And what goes for transport
###1474 goes for what is transported, as well.
###1476 And not just people.
###1479 Moving all of those commuters around,
###1482 that's just one layer of the amazing web of activity.
###1486 Because these people need to be clothed and fed
###1489 and kept warm and watered,
###1492 and that means that the megacity's routes
###1496 stretch far beyond the ordinary city boundaries,
###1501 to far-off generators providing the electricity
###1504 or distant mountain reservoirs providing the piped water.
###1509 But the greatest appetite is, of course, for food.
###1514 The megacities are monstrous hungry.
###1521 24 hours a day, seven days a week,
###1524 they suck in an astonishing array of food.
###1527 Flown, shipped and driven in from all round the world,
###1530 and we expect it served how, when and where we want it.
###1546 London is no exception. It's one very hungry and thirsty megacity.
###1551 Every year, London eats seven million tonnes of food
###1555 and downs 94 million litres of bottled water alone.
###1560 London's total food footprint is 125 times its size.
###1566 In other words, it requires the equivalent of the entire productive land of mainland Britain
###1572 to feed London.
###1582 Such is the megacity's demand for fresh food,
###1586 we're forced to grow it on an increasingly industrial scale.
###1590 Even the humble lettuce gets the treatment.
###1596 This farm produces over 60 million lettuces every year.
###1601 And to do that, it takes a well-drilled small army of pickers.
###1608 Plants get lifted, and then creeping just behind is a machine
###1612 with yet more workers bagging and packing.
###1617 Within another 24 to 48 hours, they'll have been whisked down a motorway,
###1622 unloaded, sorted, packed, loaded up again,
###1625 and now they're in your fridge perhaps.
###1628 Or they might end up here, in one of the strangest supermarkets I've ever been to.
###1637 It is supersized.
###1642 It looks like an ordinary supermarket, but it plainly isn't.
###1647 The aisles are too big, the trolleys in those aisles are too big
###1650 and the people doing the picking are all dressed in uniforms.
###1654 Because the food that they're choosing, they're not going to take home and eat.
###1658 They're not going to wash with the shampoo that they're selecting
###1662 or drink the drinks they're taking off the shelves.
###1665 They are buying for online shoppers
###1668 and they're being told what to pick and how to pick it by a computer.
###1677 So right now, to help feed the megacity, welcome to the mega supermarket.
###1683 The shelves of this unique London Tesco online store
###1686 groan with 22,500 items,
###1689 spread over the equivalent of three football pitches.
###1695 There are no bright and shiny signs enticing you to buy here,
###1699 just series of numbers and codes guiding the pickers.
###1706 When we pick, we have to pick by location.
###1709 OK. So pick by location first...
###1713 It's the numbers of the aisles you're looking for? Yes.
###1716 So you're looking for 61. Yeah. D2. Right.
###1720 Almond milk. Almond?
###1724 That's the one. That's the one. That's the one.
###1729 Sharon and her fellow workers end up picking a total of 1,800 orders every day.
###1735 That's like shopping 600,000 times for groceries a year.
###1738 Quite a lot, it's a battle with the clock
###1741 to juggle up to six separate customer orders at one go.
###1745 They've all booked their delivery slots.
###1748 And how quick do you have to be normally, when you're not surrounded by people like me?
###1753 Erm, we've got a time bar at the bottom
###1757 that tells us how quickly we're going.
###1761 At the moment, it's red and... You're not going fast enough? No.
###1766 I'm well out of time.
###1768 So they're possibly waiting for me, but...
###1772 So there's a specific van waiting for you? Yeah.
###1776 Being ordered around by a computer might make this a seemingly alienating job,
###1782 but I'm reassured there is a personal touch, however small.
###1786 So, what happens if you get to your number
###1789 and what they want isn't there?
###1793 We have to put a substitution in.
###1795 I mean, like, I've substituted this morning, erm, red wine.
###1799 They wanted Cabernet Sauvignon. Yeah. I substituted it with Shiraz.
###1805 Right. Shiraz is better anyway!
###1811 The megacity says, "Make it bigger, do it faster."
###1815 These people are presumably shopping online
###1817 because their own lives are so stressed and under the cosh,
###1820 they haven't got time to shop for themselves.
###1823 The result is that they produce a whole other group of people
###1826 who are also rushing around, shopping against the clock.
###1830 But it's a curious business. What you choose to put in your mouth
###1834 or put down your throat or clean yourself with,
###1837 these are intimate decisions
###1839 and we rely if not on the kindness of strangers
###1843 then the choice of strangers.
###1846 The honesty of strangers. The hard work of strangers.
###1855 Of course, all this consumption inevitably has a consequence.
###1858 Our modern megacities spew out huge quantities of waste.
###1864 Every year, London throws away 20 million tonnes of the stuff.
###1868 Trying to cope with just some of the deluge
###1871 is causing a massive strain for megacities.
###1873 An astonishing 40,000 miles of sewers
###1877 lurk beneath Greater London.
###1880 Uncoiled and laid end-to-end,
###1882 they'd stretch twice around the world.
###1886 But the original sewer system, a Victorian labyrinth of 450 miles of interconnecting tunnels,
###1891 still serves the city above.
###1893 And just like that other Victorian innovation, the London Underground,
###1898 the sewers are struggling to cope.
###1901 The arteries of the megacity are clogging up.
###1906 I came into television to start with because I was looking for glamour.
###1913 HE LAUGHS Now you've got it!
###1915 'Rob Smith's one of 39 flushers
###1919 'who maintain Central London's sewer network, and they do it the old-fashioned way - by hand.'
###1924 Are you ready to go then? Ready to go. Come this way.
###1929 Here we go.
###1933 Here it is.
###1936 It smells exactly as you expect. I don't have to describe it.
###1943 The Victorian sewer system was built when London was a mere toddler of a megacity,
###1949 home to only 2.5 million people.
###1951 150 years later, it has to deal with the end product of at least ten million.
###1957 The biggest headache for Rob and the small army of flushers
###1960 is not just what all those millions eat,
###1963 but what it's cooked in, too.
###1968 Wow.
###1969 HE CHUCKLES
###1971 Yeah. So, that's fat? That's fat.
###1975 Where does it come from?
###1978 About a couple of miles up in that direction.
###1981 We've got Leicester Square, Trafalgar Square.
###1983 So, is this fat from restaurants and kebab shops and so on?
###1989 Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, that's where it comes from.
###1992 So when we talk about, you know, you eat too much fat, too many burgers and chips,
###1996 your arteries get furred up... Same with the sewers.
###2000 This is London's arteries getting furred up with fat. That's right.
###2004 It's astonishing and very, very disgusting, as well!
###2010 I suppose we'd better go and take a closer look.
###2012 I think we ought to now we're down here.
###2015 WATER GUSHES
###2019 That is truly foul.
###2021 Really hard. That's old fat, that.
###2025 Oh, right. We'll go back up the top. Back up again? Yeah.
###2034 There we go. That's the product of our fast-food burger-eating,
###2040 chip-eating, kebab-eating lifestyle.
###2043 Solid fat.
###2047 Choking up the sewers underneath London.
###2050 Now I want to wipe my nose but, on the whole,
###2053 I think I won't.
###2057 Across the globe, the consequences of the waste crisis in Mexico City
###2062 are on an epic and al fresco scale compared to London's sewers.
###2066 This is what's known as the Grand Canal.
###2069 No gondolas, no palazzos and no tourists either.
###2074 It's a hundred-mile-long open sewer,
###2078 designed to transport waste water to the central sewage works.
###2084 I fear it is time for me to experience sewer cleaning
###2088 on an altogether different level.
###2095 I'm told that at this moment,
###2098 clever people are working on a form of television that you can actually smell.
###2103 And all I can say is, be very glad they haven't got there yet!
###2109 The reek here is unbelievable.
###2115 These canals were designed 100 years ago
###2118 to handle the run-off from Mexico City's rainy season.
###2122 But their history has been overtaken.
###2124 The modern mania for casually throwing things away
###2127 reaches its inevitable consequence here.
###2131 Clogged and festering, almost everything gets tossed in here.
###2142 And the truth is, we are becalmed on a sea of plastic,
###2147 dead dogs - there's one just there - and much worse.
###2152 I am, quite literally, up a certain creek
###2156 with a paddle, which is doing me no good.
###2159 I won't give you the statistics about how much excrement the average human produces each year,
###2164 you don't want to know, except that it's lots,
###2167 or as the scientists would say, lots and lots.
###2171 And so a city the size of this one, with nearly 20 million people,
###2174 produces the equivalent of an Olympic swimming pool-full of excrement every minute,
###2180 and something has to happen to it.
###2184 But blockages can't be got rid of from the relative safety of a boat, or with a spade,
###2190 as in London's ancient sewers.
###2192 This calls for someone with a diver's license, a cool head and a very strong stomach.
###2198 When it comes to unclogging, Ricardo Vazquez is the go-to guy.
###2204 Is it dangerous, what you're doing now?
###2206 HE SPEAKS SPANISH
###2210 TRANSLATION: It's dangerous because of all the pollution in the water. Also because of the glass and nails.
###2217 Is there anything you wish you hadn't found?
###2220 Dead bodies.
###2223 Two or three every year.
###2225 I hope you have a good day today. I hope it's not too bad.
###2229 I should say that Health and Safety
###2232 have insisted that I can't go down there.
###2235 And I think, for the first time in my life, I'm thinking, "Go Health and Safety!"
###2242 Once he's submerged, the only contact Ricardo will have with the outside world
###2247 is via a radio in his suit.
###2249 His suit is the only thing between him and the highly toxic broth.
###2258 That's one of the most bizarre things I've ever seen. I mean...
###2263 It's unimaginable, what he's just lowered himself into.
###2267 With glass, nails, sewage
###2270 and maybe even the odd decomposing animal to contend with, it's a risky operation.
###2275 Ricardo now has to dive to the bottom of the tank
###2278 and clear out the filters.
###2281 Down there, I'm told it's completely pitch black.
###2284 So you can't see anything at all.
###2286 What you know is that horrible things are blocking up the system.
###2291 And if they're allowed to keep blocking it up,
###2294 the entire sewage system starts to malfunction.
###2303 There's a metre of just solid trash at this bottom of this, as well, so there's no ground, if you like.
###2312 After five minutes, a radio message comes from the deep.
###2317 He's found a tree.
###2318 While still submerged, working by touch alone,
###2322 Ricardo sets about dislodging the offending tree.
###2326 I can't think of somebody who is more useful to the people of Mexico City
###2331 than the man who's just gone down there.
###2337 Blockage dealt with,
###2339 Ricardo's winched out for a shower and a strong dose of disinfectant.
###2347 The size of the megacity food-and-waste footprint
###2350 threatens the future of the planet.
###2353 But the metropolis has always been a great engine for innovation and radical change.
###2359 And the solutions aren't all top-down or about civil engineering.
###2364 They can start off deceptively small and simple.
###2369 Cooking oil.
###2371 In every city in the world,
###2373 this stuff is as common as cigarette butts and beer cans. It's everywhere.
###2378 Megacities produce millions of gallons of it all the time
###2382 and it's normally seen as a problem.
###2386 You've seen what happens when you stick it down drains and that is not pretty.
###2390 But imagine if it was, in fact, liquid gold.
###2394 An answer to transport problems.
###2398 It's a pretty weird idea,
###2401 but often, salvation...
###2405 is in the detail.
###2407 This restaurant has signed up to a pioneering scheme
###2410 that takes all their waste oil, which would simply get poured away, adding to London's sewer blockages,
###2416 and transforms it into something useful.
###2419 And it's all thanks to this man.
###2422 Every day, Nigel Jewison and his team do their restaurant round,
###2426 picking up drums of dirty, used oil.
###2431 But the HQ for Operation Cooking Oil is here,
###2434 down in the heart of old London.
###2437 Crammed in among the grimy railway arches,
###2440 this mini refinery is a magnet for London's cabbies.
###2445 Hundreds of them queue here every week to get their fill.
###2450 You can see the lovely quality of that oil. That's, er...
###2454 And this is how we like it. Classy restaurant, classy oil.
###2457 That's not always the case, though. There's a few restaurants I won't eat at, even with their good names,
###2463 after seeing their waste oil.
###2465 So this is a very straightforward filtration system.
###2469 Dirty oil becomes less dirty oil,
###2473 sits in these tanks and becomes clean-ish oil,
###2477 and then, eventually, clean oil.
###2479 At which point, it can be made into fuel for the taxis.
###2484 Hiya, Pete. How's it going? Busy on the streets? It's OK. It could be better!
###2489 It always can. Always better. Hello there. Hiya.
###2492 Have you been doing it for a while, using the biodiesel?
###2495 Is it good for you, as a taxi driver? Fantastic. Why?
###2499 It's cheaper, for a start. It's cleaner. Yeah.
###2502 With the new legislation coming on the older cabs, it could be a way to get us to last a bit longer.
###2508 Do you notice the lack of black smoke and smells?
###2511 Definitely. But because it smells of fish and chips, you're always hungry!
###2516 If you go to classier restaurants, it would smell of garlic and all sorts of stuff. Garlicky cabs.
###2522 One of my dreams when I first started up, when people started talking about smells,
###2527 was that, if I could collect all the Chinese restaurants, on another round, Indian restaurants,
###2532 we could open up a filling station with Chinese-smelling fuel, Indian-smelling fuel.
###2536 So you could choose your nationality of fuel!
###2540 It'd be brilliant, wouldn't it?
###2542 But it's good news for you guys. I think it's very good. It's a shame they can't put it in buses. Yes.
###2552 Coming to the amount of cooking oil in the city centre, around London,
###2557 how widespread could this be in fuelling taxis, fuelling cars?
###2562 If we can collect all the oil in London, we could probably fuel all the taxis,
###2567 which would be a fantastic thing. Amazing. It would be.
###2574 If a great city like London had to rely on the elected politicians and the planners for its solutions,
###2580 I think it would be a much less interesting and more constipated sort of place.
###2585 Very often, the big ideas are found
###2589 in the little nooks and side streets of the city.
###2593 And the job of the politicians is to get hold of those ideas
###2597 and, using their taxes and their rules,
###2599 to ensure that they then spread and seed much more widely.
###2608 Putting old cooking oil to good use is one thing,
###2611 but what about all the other stuff we chuck away without a thought?
###2615 Well, that ends up here, in a landfill site.
###2619 London is near to the bottom of the European cities landfill league,
###2623 only recycling about 25 percent of its waste.
###2629 And it's running out of space to dump its growing, growling
###2634 mountains of rubbish.
###2636 The truth is that we in the West throw away far too much.
###2641 I do. You probably do, as well.
###2645 And when we think about it, we may feel a bit guilty.
###2648 And increasingly, we're being kind of mildly bullied
###2653 by councils and government to throw away less.
###2657 But when you come to a place like this,
###2661 you realise why.
###2664 Perhaps we do have to learn from those parts of the world
###2667 where they recycle everything they possibly can.
###2680 In Dhaka, it isn't a case of recycling with a conscience.
###2684 This is the extreme end and it's driven by necessity.
###2688 Here, entire communities are completely reliant on salvaging the scraps,
###2694 the megacity's leftovers,
###2696 to carve out some kind of living.
###2701 It's sort of like when a large animal is killed in the jungle
###2706 and the carcass is picked completely.
###2709 And this is an urban version of the same thing.
###2712 Rather than microbes doing the picking, it's little boys.
###2718 Dhaka's main rubbish dump is the size of a small town,
###2723 and a town with its own people.
###2726 Here, anything that can be melted down or reshaped and reused
###2730 is bagged up and carted off to be resold.
###2733 And when I say anything, I really do mean anything.
###2736 What are you looking for?
###2738 TRANSLATOR SPEAKS BENGALI
###2740 Plates, cartons, bottles. Plastic... Plastic. I can understand that.
###2746 And what does she do with them when she's got them?
###2749 SHE SPEAKS BENGALI
###2751 TRANSLATION: Takes it to the shops and sell it.
###2754 Everything there is scrunched and dirty.
###2757 These are not bottles that could ordinarily be recycled.
###2760 This is absolutely the leavings of the leavings, the scraps of the scraps,
###2764 the final pickings
###2765 after everybody else further up the food chain
###2768 has taken what's worth something.
###2772 Here, even the insidious plastic shopping bag is given another life,
###2776 melted down and recycled.
###2780 In a sort of most unpleasant way, I suppose,
###2783 poverty is very efficient.
###2785 Everything is used.
###2791 This might seem like a rather hardcore solution
###2793 to the waste problem of the metropolis,
###2796 but perhaps the Dhaka necessity for re-use and recycling
###2801 has lessons for us at home.
###2804 The longer all of us live in the city, the more disconnected we get.
###2809 More of our food is processed and pre-packaged.
###2812 It arrives in cartons and little plastic boxes.
###2816 And instead of being sure about when something has gone off
###2821 and it's no longer acceptable,
###2824 we rely on those rather timid sell-by dates.
###2827 "If in doubt, chuck it out."
###2829 Which is a wasteful way of living and of eating.
###2839 Dinner with Simon and Fran,
###2842 another pair of metropolis innovators.
###2845 They call themselves freegans.
###2847 There's bread here. That's £1.30 for that.
###2851 £1.30 that'd cost in the shop. It's good bakery bread. Nothing wrong with that at all.
###2857 Large whites.
###2858 Can you find a date on there? The 16th. That's yesterday.
###2862 Bread doesn't just go off overnight.
###2864 What are these? Diet Pepsi.
###2867 I'll just pass them to you. There's a lot of it.
###2871 You'll be belching for a week! Yeah!
###2875 It makes me feel gaseous and horrible!
###2879 Just look at this!
###2883 Twice a week for the past two years, Simon and Fran have sifted through the skips
###2887 of the back of London's high-street stores and they've yet to go hungry.
###2891 Apart from the fact that it's good news for you, does it make you angry?
###2895 It does. Because of the waste.
###2897 Because there's people in the world who are starving, and we have an abundance and we throw it away.
###2903 What's that? Hold on a minute.
###2906 What have you got? Ha-ha! Chocolates. Chocolate. OK.
###2910 Not bad.
###2912 Why would that be thrown away? I have no idea. What's the...?
###2915 February. Chocolates don't just go off.
###2920 'I don't generally make a habit of routing through rubbish bins, and it does feel a little odd.
###2925 'Legally speaking, however, what's thrown away is fair game.'
###2929 And so to the getaway vehicle! THEY LAUGH
###2934 What's the range of stuff that you're picking up?
###2938 Meats. A lot of meat that we find. Yeah. Cheese. Milk.
###2941 Yoghurts. Yoghurts.
###2943 What would you say to people who say, "It's past its best-by date?"
###2948 Use your common sense and have a look at it.
###2950 Best-by date, obviously it's saying, "If you want it perfect, eat it before then."
###2954 But, you know, the food's still perfectly edible.
###2958 Have you ever been unable to feed yourselves
###2962 by freegan... lifting of stuff out of bins?
###2965 Not in London. No.
###2967 There's too much abundance and waste to not be able to do it. Yeah.
###2974 Simon and Fran's fight against the waste footprint is only half the battle.
###2978 Managing to work out how to supply a metropolis with all the resources it needs
###2983 requires an equally smart way of thinking.
###2987 Food often travels thousands of miles before it arrives on our plates.
###2992 It's inefficient, it's wasteful.
###2995 But to find a solution, perhaps we need to travel back in time.
###3006 Away, at last, from the madness of the megacity.
###3011 Birdsong, nature... Back in the countryside.
###3017 Except that I'm not in the countryside.
###3020 I am inside Mexico City
###3024 and we're on our way to see its famous floating farms.
###3029 They go right the way back as an idea to the original Aztec city,
###3033 which was built on a lake.
###3036 And the way they fed themselves was, the created little floating islands,
###3040 and on those islands, they grew the plants they needed to eat.
###3048 In the 16th century, Mexico City, or Tenochtitlan,
###3053 was the largest city in the world.
###3055 The Aztecs' floating islands, or farms, were vast rafts
###3059 made out of reeds, fertilised with mud from the lake, and organic waste.
###3064 The result was highly productive. An amazing two-thirds of the city's food
###3069 was grown within the city limits.
###3073 DOG BARKS
###3076 Now we're in the 21st century,
###3078 one of the questions is, could we go right the way back?
###3082 Could we learn to grow more of our own food actually inside the city?
###3089 Pedro Castillo is keeping traditions alive
###3093 from before the Spanish Conquest.
###3099 It's a beautiful. Claro.
###3101 His fertile little holding of vegetables
###3105 is home to livestock and an abundance of fruit and vegetables,
###3109 which are all sold back to downtown Mexico City
###3112 a couple of miles away.
###3114 Why did they start to grow the food on the island?
###3118 And is it a good way of growing food, to have a floating farm?
###3121 HE SPEAKS SPANISH
###3125 TRANSLATION: It was more about necessity.
###3128 It was the lack of space, the lack of room to cultivate their crops that brought them here.
###3134 And then they noticed it was very good for farming.
###3137 So, you yourself, what do you grow here and where do you sell what you grow?
###3146 They grow lettuce, spinach, tomato,
###3149 corn, radish.
###3151 < HE SPEAKS SPANISH
###3153 Normally, they sell it in the market here in Xochimilco,
###3157 but right now, they're selling to very selective restaurants in Mexico City. Very good.
###3163 Pedro makes a mean tamale, that's a kind of corn dough served in leaves.
###3169 Mm. Very good.
###3170 And like all good farmers, Pedro does a nice line in home brew, as well.
###3176 This is a traditional tipple which is made out of cactus sap.
###3180 It's got a kind of caramel taste. And it would be extremely rude not to sample it properly.
###3186 It is damn fine!
###3187 Mm! Very good. HE SPEAKS SPANISH
###3196 TRANSLATION: You're offering it to the mother earth.
###3206 Of course, this is very much a Mexico City story.
###3209 You don't get tamales and floating farms most places.
###3214 But perhaps there's a lesson here.
###3216 Because although they're built by humans,
###3219 cities depend on nature.
###3222 We're inside nature, we're part of nature.
###3225 And the great cities that we build thrive or die
###3231 because of the natural world around them.
###3239 We tear up the past and we ignore nature at our peril.
###3243 Just like Mexico City, London used to grow a substantial amount of its own food
###3248 within a few short miles of the centre.
###3251 This fertile farmland, known as the breadbasket of London,
###3255 is better known today as Heathrow Airport,
###3259 where food, very often similar food,
###3263 now arrives from South America, Africa, Asia.
###3268 I'm not saying we should rip up and plough what we've built over,
###3272 but we do need to be more clever about how we use what we've got.
###3277 If the future shape of metropolis seems to be ever more dense and increasingly high rise,
###3283 then, maybe, some of the answers to feeding the city have to be urban ones.
###3289 For decades, people have imagined a science-fiction future.
###3294 A vertical city and farms in the sky.
###3297 It's not entirely far-fetched.
###3300 Architects are already hard at work.
###3310 Nearer to hand, inside this inner-city London terrace,
###3314 the seeds of something pretty big could be growing.
###3321 Like most ground-breaking ideas, they start small.
###3327 This is a mini hydroponic and aquaponic farm.
###3333 There is no soil here. The plants are grown under light, in mineral solutions and water,
###3339 fertilised by fish droppings.
###3344 Fresh eggs are laid daily in a rooftop coop.
###3348 I'm under no illusion that a few salad plants and hens are going to solve the food crisis,
###3354 but think how much neglected space London has to offer
###3358 a whole city of potential 21st century urban farmers.
###3363 Farmers like Paul Smith.
###3365 Our big plan is to grow food all around the city,
###3369 in warehouses, empty buildings and old derelict spaces.
###3374 When you're growing inside a building,
###3377 the best way to make use of the space is to grow upwards, create vertical installations,
###3381 layers of food within buildings.
###3383 This a movement happening all around the world that we hope to be part of.
###3387 We're trying to demonstrate you can get the best of both worlds.
###3390 You can have an ecological food system in the city,
###3393 and if you do that, we'll have a much lower food footprint for everybody.
###3398 If we can get enough people growing food in cities, it'll be one part of the picture.
###3404 The city has an absolute, in our view, critical role
###3407 in fulfilling the future food needs of a place like London.
###3417 Over the next century, disasters permitting,
###3421 the growth of the megacities will stretch onwards.
###3424 In the last hour, in the time that it's taken to watch this programme,
###3429 7,500 people have moved from the country to a big city.
###3433 In that hour, the world's slum population has gone up by 3,000 people.
###3441 Shanghai's underground, already the longest in the world,
###3444 will have grown by a further five metres.
###3449 And so is the inexorable rise and the dominance of the megacity
###3453 a cause for despair or hope?
###3459 There's no single answer to any of this.
###3462 We need the planners. We need the Shanghai-sized ambitions.
###3468 But we also need the kick from the streets.
###3471 We need the stroppy cyclists, the backyard innovators,
###3474 and the idealistic freegans trying new ways of living.
###3478 Because cities don't belong to the town hall or the architects or the commissars.
###3486 Cities belong to citizens.
###3489 Are they going to be new urban nightmares
###3493 or are they going to be places where we dream new dreams and bring them into effect?
###3498 Well, that's up to me. And you.
