him twice in a week.


613
0:22:27,7 --> 0:22:28,59
Really hospitable.


614
0:22:28,59 --> 0:22:31,764
I don't know, maybe he was like
into Stephanie, he wanted


615
0:22:31,764 --> 0:22:34,1
a little panda love.


616
0:22:34,1 --> 0:22:36,26
But yeah, that's--


617
0:22:36,26 --> 0:22:36,36
I think that's--


618
0:22:36,36 --> 0:22:38,1
-Yeah, I was getting that vibe
where he was trying to pick up


619
0:22:38,1 --> 0:22:38,232
on me.


620
0:22:38,232 --> 0:22:41,13
-You know, this day started
off real stressful--


621
0:22:41,13 --> 0:22:43,14
getting picked up by the cops,
changed the outfits, going


622
0:22:43,14 --> 0:22:44,17
into hiding--


623
0:22:44,17 --> 0:22:45,68
but now I think we're cool.


624
0:22:45,68 --> 0:22:46,72
I think we're covert.


625
0:22:46,72 --> 0:22:47,58
No one can find us.


626
0:22:47,58 --> 0:22:49,26
We're all good.


627
0:22:49,26 --> 0:22:50,145
Let's go.
