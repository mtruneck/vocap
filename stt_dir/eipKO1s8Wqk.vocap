###5 How's he doing?
###7 He has neutropenic fever. His white blood cell count's stabilised.
###11 He's not getting any worse.
###14 - How you feeling, Jared? - OK, l guess.
###16 l heard your dad arranged for a visit from The Rock?
###19 l'm 1 3, l must love wrestling, right?
###22 Come on, The Rock's a movie star.
###24 What could a guy possibly wanna see more?
###28 Guys, we need an answer.
###31 Name one thing guys wanna see more than anything in the world?
###35 Louie, we're gonna go with boobs.
###39 Show me boobs.
###41 There they are.
###43 Good job!
###46 l wanna see 'em on a real girl. A cute girl.
###50 You're cute.
###69 <i>The janitor,</i> <i>This guy is always bothering me,</i>
###73 <i>Don't look at him</i> <i>don't talk to him don't,,,</i>
###77 What's your point? Ammonia too strong?
###80 - No, l have a... - That's one.
###83 Keep pushin'.
###85 Hey, sport. Got your page.
###87 This better be good. Paging the Chief of Medicine.
###90 <i>Dr Steadman, Resident</i> <i>and first-class teacher's pet,</i>
###98 Sir, l was going over Mr Martinez's chart,
###102 and it seems the TlPS procedure he's scheduled for is unnecessary.
###106 Why unnecessary?
###108 He's dead.
###112 Excellent catch, Dr...
###116 Dr...
###117 <i>Dorian! You see me every day,</i>
###120 - <i>Say my name, Say it!</i> - Martinez.
###122 That was the name of the patient, sir.
###125 - Avery. - That's the clipboard manufacturer.
###128 - Fine work, doctor. Fine work. - <i>I hear that,</i>
###133 Ammonia's a little strong today.
###137 That's two.
###142 Steady, boy.
###145 Now, Rowdy.
###149 - When you're not here, he does it. - l'm sure. He's shy.
###153 l think you should go ahead and do it.
###155 - l am not flashing my breasts. - lt's easy.
###158 - You just go like this. - That's hot.
###162 l went by paediatrics.
###166 - They thought it was funny. - l'm borrowing a sweatshirt.
###172 What did we agree you would do whenever l left a room?
###175 - l'm sorry, baby. - That's better.
###185 My man Turk is getting it daily, nightly and ever-so-rightly.
###188 What up, dawg!
###191 <i>Once every 4,2 seconds</i> <i>a man says something stupid</i>
###194 <i>that a woman hears and punishes him for,</i> <i>This wasn't one of those times,</i>
###199 What did you just say?
###201 What up, dawg?
###203 Why would you think we'd slept together?
###205 Because l'm a nurse? Because l'm Latina?
###208 Because you guys have been dating for a while.
###210 Do Latina women put out more? That's not something l've heard.
###215 - Turk told me. - No! l didn't! He assumed.
###218 And did you correct him?
###220 l've been really busy at the hospital lately.
###225 ls that how you see this relationship? As some mad dash to the finish line?
###229 l'll take you into that bedroom now
###232 and you will be walking sideways for the rest of your life,
###235 because l will have used all your up and down. Now, is that what you want?
###239 - No. - Good.
###241 Because what l want is for this to be a real relationship.
###245 l want us to know each other better than we know ourselves.
###248 - Wow. - That's right, ''wow''.
###251 So if you really want me ''daily and nightly and ever-so-rightly'',...
###256 That sounds like something you'd say.
###258 ...show me you know me.
###262 l think you should let the kid meet the ladies.
###265 You're the one who told Kelso that Mr Martinez was dead?
###269 - That's terrific work. - <i>Looks like word gets around,</i>
###273 What in the name of <i>Are You There God?</i> <i>It's Me Margaret</i> were you thinking?
###277 l'm certain invasive vascular procedures have a low success rate on dead people.
###283 That TlPS procedure was for Mrs Blitt down in 1 03.
###287 You see, she doesn't have insurance.
###290 But Mr Martinez had great insurance.
###293 Should l talk slower or get a nurse who speaks fluent Moron?
###296 - You don't have to be mean about it. - What do you want from me?
###315 l don't know if they taught you this in the land of puppy-dog tails
###319 where you obviously, if not grew up, then spent most of your summers,
###323 but you're in the real world now.
###330 - <i>Don't say it,</i> - l still think l was right.
###332 <i>Once every 6,3 seconds</i> <i>a man says something stupid</i>
###335 <i>that another man hears and punishes</i> <i>him for, Luckily this wasn't,,,</i>
###339 - That's it! - <i>Oh no,</i>
###341 Do you know what this is? This is me washing my hands of you.
###346 l will not be in the same room with you again, starting...
###350 now.
###362 Tissue?
###363 <i>It's a challenge,,,</i>
###365 <i>Little bit of flow like,,,</i>
###367 <i>''Fighting Joe'' Hooker,,,</i>
###372 <i>I don't need Dr Cox, Big jerk,</i>
###376 <i>I hate him,</i>
###380 Hey, sport. Or should l say howdy, Mr Pouty?
###384 lt's been a rough day.
###386 So l hear. Well, anyway, l'm very proud of you, Dr...
###391 <i>Just look at my badge,</i>
###393 Dr Turk.
###394 This is my roommate's badge. We must have switched...
###398 That's a great anecdote. You should write that down in your journal.
###402 Then your kids can read about it when you're dead.
###405 - They're waiting for us... - ln a moment.
###407 lf you go easy on the stories, l'd love you to join me for golf tomorrow.
###412 - That'd be terrific, sir. - Super.
###425 You wanna show a woman you know her, buy her a little something.
###429 None of my patients are improving.
###431 - l'm gonna buy her flowers. - Yeah!
###434 Please, been done to death.
###437 l don't get it. l do everything by the book.
###440 Maybe that's the problem. You approach things too clinically.
###444 How about chocolates?
###446 With rich cliché centres?
###449 Have you ever treated your patients
###451 with something other than traditional medicine?
###455 l'm gonna buy her a really nice pen.
###458 No, she loves to write. She handwrites all of her letters
###462 because she says e-mail's too impersonal. That's perfect.
###466 - A pen is good. - Yeah!
###473 All l gotta do is find time to get out of here and maybe l'll buy her one.
###477 All l'm saying is there's more to healing than what's in the books.
###482 l talk to my patients. l sing to them, ask what their hobbies are,
###487 and tell them ghost stories about an old sea captain.
###492 Thought you'd be interested in that kid Jared's chart.
###499 Look at that white blood cell count.
###501 And all it took was a visit from The Rock.
###504 The Rock was here and nobody told me?
###506 - The Rock couldn't make it. - Well, somebody did something.
###516 <i>It felt weird knowing Dr Cox and I would</i> <i>never be working in the same room again,</i>
###520 Check her LFTs and coags.
###521 <i>Every time I think something</i> <i>the opposite happens,</i>
###524 <i>I'm not having sex this weekend,</i>
###526 You're cute.
###530 Who's the present from?
###532 - My boyfriend. - When did he give it to you?
###535 <i>He's pretending yesterday didn't happen,</i> <i>If he thinks I'll forgive him,,,</i>
###540 The reason l was bent out of shape yesterday...
###543 - l accept! - Don't interrupt me. Come here.
###547 Pull that curtain.
###550 Mrs Blitt over there needs the TlPS procedure, no insurance.
###553 She can now look forward to a lifetime
###556 of encephalopathy and jaundice thanks to Bottom-Line Bob.
###560 - ls he really that bad? - l hate Robert Kelso.
###563 l hate his family, friends, the guy that cleans his racist lawn jockey.
###568 l hate anybody who even associates with him. ls that clear?
###573 Totally.
###578 Call me.
###581 Elliot, check out these ass slides.
###584 How's that stuff even get up there?
###588 l fell on it.
###589 l fell on it.
###591 l fell on it.
###592 l was bored.
###594 The doctors in the ER have a box where they keep all this junk.
###598 - Next to the Lost and Found Box? - There's no Lost and Found Box.
###603 There's an Ass Box.
###607 - That's not Carla's pen? - l had no time to shop!
###620 Beautiful day for golf, sports?
###622 Yes, sir, Dr Kelso.
###625 l don't know what you're trying to pull, but l am not a guy you wanna mess with.
###630 Steadman, l need a tee.
###632 A tee, or some tea, sir? Because l've brought both.
###635 <i>It's just a friendly game of golf</i> <i>with a couple of guys from work,</i>
###639 Excellent, our fourth has arrived.
###642 What's up, Newbie?
###657 <i>He's got nothing to say,</i> <i>After all he's here too,</i>
###661 - l thought you hated Kelso. - l do.
###664 And watching his face as l kick his worthless butt
###667 up and down this golf course every week, is basically...
###671 lt's the most fun l can have without having to cuddle afterwards.
###676 Good night, lrene! Fantastic golf shot, sir.
###679 Real nice length. Now, does your husband happen to play?
###684 But, no, l'm not a hypocrite for being here.
###687 What's your pathetic excuse, you whiny little suck-up?
###691 <i>Ignore him,</i> <i>Just let your game do all the talking,</i>
###699 That'll play.
###707 Don't open it! Please, don't open it!
###711 Since we've been chatting, maybe you could raise your heart rate for me?
###721 What am l doing? This is stupid.
###744 Don't make her open it.
###749 Are you that busy?
###751 You do know me. Sweetie, l love this!
###757 lt's so, it's so cool. lt's cool.
###759 - l'm woozy. - You're fine.
###763 Today's the day l finally beat his uppity, insubordinate...
###766 Great shot, doctor!
###769 You see, l always say keep your friends close
###773 and your enemies closer.
###777 Can you believe him? You're away and yet he hit first.
###780 - lt's a technicality. - But there's the rub.
###783 The rules are there for a reason.
###785 lf you break one, why not break them all?
###800 Before medicine ever became a business,
###802 the only rule was to do your best to help the patient.
###806 Like it or not, medicine is a business.
###808 lf the hospital shuts down, then who are we helping then?
###813 So, only people with money deserve medical treatment?
###818 Dammit!
###819 lt's about what's best for the hospital.
###824 lt's about what's best for the patient.
###835 The only reason l go back to that hospital day after day
###838 is because l care about those patients.
###841 Every one of 'em.
###845 You've got a lot of potential, sport.
###848 You stick with me
###850 and you're going to be climbing the ladder very quickly.
###854 lsn't that what you want?
###858 You have to sink this for the win, Cox.
###860 Newbie, l almost forgot.
###862 l'm gonna get Mrs Blitt her TlPS procedure tomorrow,
###866 with or without insurance, and l want you to help me.
###870 Now tell me, do you have the stones to sink a putt when you have to?
###883 See you next Wednesday.
###888 l love this game.
###890 l can't decide if l should help Cox.
###893 At least you didn't give your girlfriend a gift that used to be inside someone.
###897 That's true.
###900 l have magic breasts.
###904 How many has she had?
###908 Almost one.
###910 You know what, Cox doesn't need your help
###912 taking her down for a TlPS procedure.
###916 He shouldn't even be putting you in that situation.
###919 - You're right. - Hell, yeah, l'm right!
###921 Screw Cox.
###924 - Not afraid of him, are you? - Hell, no!
###928 <i>Maybe a little,</i>
###933 - That's four. - That's three.
###935 That's five.
###940 All righty, we're through here.
###942 - Somebody call it. - Wait.
###948 Right. Time of death, 6.20.
###956 Hey. There's my buppy.
###960 Did you just say ''buppy''?
###962 Cos that's not gonna work for me.
###966 Carla, we gotta talk.
###969 We can talk later.
###973 Later's good.
###976 Let's just worry about getting you better. OK, gorgeous?
###980 <i>I decided Cox was wrong,</i>
###982 <i>There's room to play by the rules</i> <i>and care about the patients,</i>
###986 Do a wallet biopsy on her, and if the insurance doesn't check out,
###991 l want her in the nursing home before she can gum down a single fruit cup.
###995 <i>That was when I realised</i> <i>how Dr Kelso truly saw these people,</i>
###1002 <i>Could I have a price check</i> <i>on a 7 4-year-old female</i>
###1005 <i>with prerenal azotemia?</i>
###1007 Bag her.
###1015 Come on, l wanna show you something.
###1017 Wait. lt's about the pen.
###1019 l thought a really nice one would be a great gift,
###1022 and l see a great one... in the Lost and Found Box.
###1026 There is no Lost and Found Box. There's an Ass Box...
###1030 Yeah, there is.
###1037 And you were this close to getting everything you wanted.
###1041 l assume this is what you wanted.
###1043 Yes.
###1044 And yet you tell me that your thoughtful token of love
###1048 wasn't a token of love at all. lt was an ass pen.
###1052 You come home and tell me this because being open and honest
###1056 is more important to you than having sex with me?
###1063 Are you coming or what?
###1066 Hell, yeah.
###1075 Stay, Rowdy, stay.
###1077 lt took me three hours to realise...
###1079 - Excuse me, miss. - Can l help you?
###1081 l'm afraid l have an awful case of the gotta-see-'ems.
###1087 That's not even a real disease.
###1089 At what point did l become a crazy person?
###1091 Come on. Yes, exposing yourself to a dead guy
###1094 might have been a tad unorthodox,
###1096 and it might be hard to live down.
###1100 - l'm waiting for the ''but''. - So's everyone else.
###1103 That's not funny.
###1105 - Thanks. Glad l shared. - Come on.
###1108 When l look at you, l look at a doctor
###1110 who will do whatever it takes to help a patient.
###1113 - Really? - Yeah, really.
###1115 <i>And on that note,,,</i>
###1117 lf you still want my help, l'm on board.
###1119 lt's way too big of a risk for a peon.
###1121 l just wanted to see what team you were playing for.
###1124 - <i>So it was all a test,</i> - Besides,
###1128 - l already did it. - Cox!
###1131 Run, Junior. Daddy's home.
###1135 Did you think l wouldn't find out what you did?
###1138 - What did l do? - You insolent...
###1140 l'm insolent?
###1141 <i>I know it sounds melodramatic</i> <i>but as I watched the two of them</i>
###1145 <i>they weren't battling for patients</i> <i>or insurance but for my soul,</i>
###1150 - She needed the TlPS... - l've got you this time.
###1153 l can taste it!
###1155 <i>It's an old story really,</i> <i>Good versus bad, Right versus wrong,</i>
###1160 <i>The dark side versus the light,</i>
###1168 l've been waiting for this moment all my life.
###1180 Easy, Chewie.
###1186 l'll teach you to respect this institution.
###1191 l hope you learn from this.
###1195 No!
###1200 You're suspended. Effective immediately.
###1210 Well, sport. lt looks like a permanent spot just opened up
###1215 on the golf course.
###1217 How does joining the Chief of Medicine for a weekly round sound?
###1221 l'm not really that into golf.
###1223 l guess that's your choice, isn't it, Dr Dorian?
###1229 <i>I liked it better</i> <i>when he didn't know my name,</i>
###1234 That's one for me.
###1242 That's two.
###1243 l'm hurt. �
