###15 JOANNA FUERTES-KNIGHT: The Royals!
###17 Rulers of this mighty kingdom.
###20 Now, the queen may be having a glorious nationwide party for
###23 her Diamond Jubilee, but it's going to be nowhere near as
###26 good as my patriotic picnic.
###29 Harry!
###29 MALE SPEAKER: Jubilee picnic.
###31 JOANNA FUERTES-KNIGHT: So today for my royal hamper, I'm
###34 going to be making a pink lemonade Victoria sponge, some
###38 cava-jam with scones, and then some dog food sausage rolls
###42 for the corgis.
###43 Arf, arf, arf.
###44 MALE SPEAKER: Pink lemonade cake.
###47 JOANNA FUERTES-KNIGHT: So I've decided to bring the Victoria
###50 sponge up-to-date and make a pink lemonade cake.
###54 It's like any other cake, you're going to start with
###57 breaking some eggs.
###59 Harry's my favorite, because I imagine if it wasn't a royal
###62 he'd just be daggering some girl at Oceana,
###64 knocking back Reefs.
###67 I kind of feel sorry for the queen, because her life is
###70 just an endless stream of being forced to go to public
###73 events, looking at things.
###75 When I bet all she really wants to do
###77 is hang out at Windsor.
###78 Walking around with a rifle, with a Rothman fag hanging out
###81 of her mouth and just finding wild rabbits to
###83 shoot in the face.
###84 If I were the queen, I would just get a hologram like
###87 Tupac, and send it out to do all the shitty work.
###90 Make sure it's whisked thoroughly.
###91 And then you're going to put it in the two tins.
###94 So it's one in the pink and two in the tins.
###98 MALE SPEAKER: Cava-jam scones.
###100 JOANNA FUERTES-KNIGHT: So the jam is really simple.
###103 It's just blueberries, sugar, and some cava.
###107 And you're going to dump that all in a pan.
###109 It's really funny.
###110 I guess from the outside looking in, as a nation we
###113 must look really patriotic.
###115 Because whenever there's any kind of royal bank holiday,
###118 everyone has a party and gets shit-faced.
###120 It's almost like a nationwide Nottinghill
###123 carnival for white people.
###125 MALE SPEAKER: Dog sausage rolls.
###128 JOANNA FUERTES-KNIGHT: Now, I don't want to leave out the
###130 best bit of the royal family, and that's the Queen's corgis.
###134 So I'm going to make them some dog food sausage rolls.
###137 So the first step is to roll out some puff pastry.
###141 I couldn't be fucked to make my own.
###143 You have to be an idiot with too much time on their hands
###146 to make your own puff pastry.
###147 I like corgis.
###149 Because you know when you look at something really cute and
###152 you want to crush it?
###153 Just things that are already pudgy with big eyes, you want
###156 to squeeze it to death.
###157 They're so cute, I want to crush their skulls.
###159 
###168 Oh, fuck it.
###170 Oh, I got it on my crotch.
###172 And now to roll them up into roll shapes.
###177 You're going to pop these in the oven.
###179 They go all puffed up and golden.
###181 
###185 MALE SPEAKER: Cake layers.
###186 
###193 JOANNA FUERTES-KNIGHT: So I've used most of the homemade
###196 cava-jam already in my scones.
###199 I'm just going to put it in the filling
###200 of my lemonade cake.
###202 I'd rather have a chemical rainbow in my mouth than bite
###207 into a bean burger that takes like a coaster.
###209 That's what science is for, making things better.
###214 I'm really sick of all these pretentious foodies.
###218 Good food doesn't need fancy
###220 ingredients to taste delicious.
###223 There you go.
###225 It's a cake fit for a queen.
###226 
###230 Who's a good corgi, hm?
###233 Good corgi.
###234 
###238 Aw!
###239 
###244 Good corgi.
###246
