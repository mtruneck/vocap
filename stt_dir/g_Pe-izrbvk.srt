2
0:0:0,2 --> 0:0:1,86
STEVE SPANGLER: Science
and magic-- they seem


3
0:0:1,86 --> 0:0:2,88
to go hand in hand.


4
0:0:2,88 --> 0:0:5,65
In fact, science is a magician's
biggest fear,


5
0:0:5,65 --> 0:0:8,55
because if you think like a
scientist, it makes their job


6
0:0:8,55 --> 0:0:9,65
so much harder.


7
0:0:9,65 --> 0:0:12,36
That's why I want you to be
thinking like a scientist on


8
0:0:12,36 --> 0:0:14,53
this episode with
science magic.


9
0:0:14,53 --> 0:0:17,725
I'm Steve Spangler, and I'm all
about making science fun.


10
0:0:17,725 --> 0:0:20,75
For the last 20 years, I've
been teaching ways to turn


11
0:0:20,75 --> 0:0:23,77
ordinary science experiments
into unforgettable learning


12
0:0:23,77 --> 0:0:24,462
experiences.


13
0:0:24,462 --> 0:0:27,41
I have an amazing team who will
do whatever it takes to


14
0:0:27,41 --> 0:0:30,9
affect the way people think
about science, and to do that,


15
0:0:30,9 --> 0:0:32,45
I live by one motto--


16
0:0:32,45 --> 0:0:35,49
make it big, do it right,
give it class.


17
0:0:35,49 --> 0:0:40,33



18
0:0:40,33 --> 0:0:41,92
Take a look at this.


19
0:0:41,92 --> 0:0:45,17
I have two cut-out shapes
that are here.


20
0:0:45,17 --> 0:0:45,91
I don't know what
to call them--


21
0:0:45,91 --> 0:0:47,46
French fries, arcs.


22
0:0:47,46 --> 0:0:48,76
The yellow one is here.


23
0:0:48,76 --> 0:0:51,44
The red one I've cut so
that it's smaller


24
0:0:51,44 --> 0:0:52,12
than the yellow one.


25
0:0:52,12 --> 0:0:53,42
How much smaller?--


26
0:0:53,42 --> 0:0:54,125
hard to estimate.


27
0:0:54,125 --> 0:0:55,55
I don't know--six
centimeters--


28
0:0:55,55 --> 0:0:56,56
something like that.


29
0:0:56,56 --> 0:0:57,35
No camera tricks.


30
0:0:57,35 --> 0:0:58,11
Don't blink an eye.


31
0:0:58,11 --> 0:1:0,8
Watch this.


32
0:1:0,8 --> 0:1:1,94
Bam!


33
0:1:1,94 --> 0:1:4,489
Maybe it's the yellow one that's
small, and it's the red


34
0:1:4,489 --> 0:1:5,14
one that's big.


35
0:1:5,14 --> 0:1:8,11
No, wait, maybe it's the red one
that's small, and it's the


36
0:1:8,11 --> 0:1:9,87
yellow one that's bigger.


37
0:1:9,87 --> 0:1:12,725
That's a pretty amazing
optical illusion.


38
0:1:12,725 --> 0:1:14,61
So it's not actually
a magic trick.


39
0:1:14,61 --> 0:1:16,92
Indeed, it is an optical
illusion, because watch what


40
0:1:16,92 --> 0:1:19,29
happens when you flip
it over here.


41
0:1:19,29 --> 0:1:21,88
They're exactly equal.


42
0:1:21,88 --> 0:1:26,11
One goes over the top like this,
and it almost looks like


43
0:1:26,11 --> 0:1:29,79
they're perfectly equal until
you snap, and watch this.


44
0:1:29,79 --> 0:1:32,775
The red one is bigger
than yellow one--


45
0:1:32,775 --> 0:1:34,8
(WHISPERING) magic.


46
0:1:34,8 --> 0:1:35,7
All right-- easy to make.


47
0:1:35,7 --> 0:1:38,5
It's classic science magic with
a super optical illusion.


48
0:1:38,5 --> 0:1:40,81
Now, you cut these, for example,
out of a paper plate,


49
0:1:40,81 --> 0:1:42,69
so you cut the rim off
of a paper plate.


50
0:1:42,69 --> 0:1:43,75
That would be perfect.


51
0:1:43,75 --> 0:1:47,86
You're just trying to get an
arc that has just a nice


52
0:1:47,86 --> 0:1:49,39
smooth edge that's here.


53
0:1:49,39 --> 0:1:51,79
If truth be told, you can
actually go to Starbucks and


54
0:1:51,79 --> 0:1:54,2
take the little thing that
goes on the outside-- you


55
0:1:54,2 --> 0:1:56,59
know, to keep your hand from
getting hot-- and peel that


56
0:1:56,59 --> 0:1:58,97
apart-- not while somebody's
holding the cup-- and lay it


57
0:1:58,97 --> 0:2:0,9
down, and it gets a pretty good
arc, so you can do the


58
0:2:0,9 --> 0:2:2,44
same thing that way, as well.


59
0:2:2,44 --> 0:2:5,36
The secret is that your eyes
played a trick on your brain.


60
0:2:5,36 --> 0:2:5,665
Watch.


61
0:2:5,665 --> 0:2:8,949
If you haven't guessed it by
now, the arcs are exactly the


62
0:2:8,949 --> 0:2:11,94
same, so you need to make two
arcs, but make sure that


63
0:2:11,94 --> 0:2:12,75
they're different colors.


64
0:2:12,75 --> 0:2:14,7
You could make them out of
plastic if you wanted to.


65
0:2:14,7 --> 0:2:17,89
Like these, this is a material
that you could write on, so


66
0:2:17,89 --> 0:2:19,75
maybe a message could be written
here if you want to


67
0:2:19,75 --> 0:2:20,95
compare two different things.


68
0:2:20,95 --> 0:2:24,52
These are just made out a kind
of plasticy material.


69
0:2:24,52 --> 0:2:27,43
Watch what happens when you put
the first one down, and


70
0:2:27,43 --> 0:2:30,0
this one goes on the top, notice
what your eye does


71
0:2:30,0 --> 0:2:30,66
immediately.


72
0:2:30,66 --> 0:2:32,21
It's a comparison game.


73
0:2:32,21 --> 0:2:36,21
Immediately, your eye compares
this long line here with the


74
0:2:36,21 --> 0:2:39,87
shorter line here, and
your brain says this


75
0:2:39,87 --> 0:2:40,82
is the bigger one.


76
0:2:40,82 --> 0:2:44,0
Now, the optical illusion looks
better even the farther


77
0:2:44,0 --> 0:2:46,44
away you get it, so from
there, it looks great.


78
0:2:46,44 --> 0:2:49,5
Even if it's in the center, it
looks like this one is the


79
0:2:49,5 --> 0:2:51,9
small one and this one's
the big one.


80
0:2:51,9 --> 0:2:55,49
When you trade it out like this,
it's the same illusion,


81
0:2:55,49 --> 0:2:57,84
but you're just switching
it back and forth.


82
0:2:57,84 --> 0:2:59,0
Now, some people will
do it like this.


83
0:2:59,0 --> 0:3:0,28
It's all part of the
presentation.


84
0:3:0,28 --> 0:3:2,32
You could very easily
say this--


85
0:3:2,32 --> 0:3:4,55
the red one is bigger
than the yellow one.


86
0:3:4,55 --> 0:3:6,5
You can actually see that
by holding it up.


87
0:3:6,5 --> 0:3:8,8
See how the red one is bigger
than the yellow one like this.


88
0:3:8,8 --> 0:3:11,81
That's OK, because I can stretch
the yellow one, and


89
0:3:11,81 --> 0:3:14,81
now the yellow one is larger
than the red one.


90
0:3:14,81 --> 0:3:16,58
No, maybe the red one's larger
than the yellow one.


91
0:3:16,58 --> 0:3:18,695
I'm so confused.


92
0:3:18,695 --> 0:3:21,6
The comparison is great.


93
0:3:21,6 --> 0:3:22,66
So what does this have
to do with science?


94
0:3:22,66 --> 0:3:24,98
It's great for comparison,
because you can come to the


95
0:3:24,98 --> 0:3:26,92
wrong conclusion very
easily if you're


96
0:3:26,92 --> 0:3:29,5
not comparing equals.


97
0:3:29,5 --> 0:3:32,7
So, for example, this here, the
bottom one looks bigger


98
0:3:32,7 --> 0:3:35,23
than the top one because you're
allowing your eyes to


99
0:3:35,23 --> 0:3:37,72
compare this long line
with the short line.


100
0:3:37,72 --> 0:3:39,58
If you're coming to a conclusion
in a science


101
0:3:39,58 --> 0:3:42,17
experiment, or you're gathering
all the data, it's


102
0:3:42,17 --> 0:3:44,81
easy to come to a false
conclusions unless you're


103
0:3:44,81 --> 0:3:47,8
comparing the same things.


104
0:3:47,8 --> 0:3:49,22
This happens all the time when
people do an experiment with


105
0:3:49,22 --> 0:3:51,51
multiple variables, and they
get a different result, and


106
0:3:51,51 --> 0:3:53,4
they do a comparison,
and they come to a


107
0:3:53,4 --> 0:3:54,51
conclusion that's wrong--


108
0:3:54,51 --> 0:3:56,72
come to find out they had
too many variables.


109
0:3:56,72 --> 0:3:59,71
You have to be a
good comparer.


110
0:3:59,71 --> 0:4:2,35
Is that a word-- "comparer"?


111
0:4:2,35 --> 0:4:4,0
Just compare things correctly.


112
0:4:4,0 --> 0:4:6,43
So I've got a little treat
for you on this episode.


113
0:4:6,43 --> 0:4:9,53
What happens when you take
magicians and you put them all


114
0:4:9,53 --> 0:4:11,11
together in one place?


115
0:4:11,11 --> 0:4:13,36
Things disappear, and things
float in the air.


116
0:4:13,36 --> 0:4:15,48
It's called a magic convention,
and we're lucky


117
0:4:15,48 --> 0:4:16,839
here, because in Colorado--


118
0:4:16,839 --> 0:4:18,459
in Fort Collins, Colorado--


119
0:4:18,459 --> 0:4:21,79
there are 250 magicians or so
from all over the world that


120
0:4:21,79 --> 0:4:23,53
get together to magish for the
weekend and kind of share


121
0:4:23,53 --> 0:4:26,22
their secrets, and we have some
access to a place that I


122
0:4:26,22 --> 0:4:27,525
want to show you.


123
0:4:27,525 --> 0:4:28,55
So close the doors.


124
0:4:28,55 --> 0:4:30,12
We're going on a field trip.


125
0:4:30,12 --> 0:4:32,23
Open the doors, open the
doors, open, open--


126
0:4:32,23 --> 0:4:34,97
can I have my keys?


127
0:4:34,97 --> 0:4:36,325
Close the doors.


128
0:4:36,325 --> 0:4:38,61
All right, well, here we are
at Magic in the Rockies.


129
0:4:38,61 --> 0:4:40,76
This is one of the premier
magic conventions.


130
0:4:40,76 --> 0:4:45,3
It's like nerd week here in
Fort Collins, Colorado.


131
0:4:45,3 --> 0:4:47,92
Top notch magicians from all
over the country-- people who


132
0:4:47,92 --> 0:4:50,52
play Las Vegas, and people who
work corporate events, and


133
0:4:50,52 --> 0:4:53,47
people that do the birthday
parties and stuff on


134
0:4:53,47 --> 0:4:54,0
television--


135
0:4:54,0 --> 0:4:58,2
they're here, and they're here
to share their magic, and how


136
0:4:58,2 --> 0:5:2,9
they do it, and share it with
other people, so I'm totally


137
0:5:2,9 --> 0:5:3,33
in nerd heaven.


138
0:5:3,33 --> 0:5:4,58
Here we go.


139
0:5:4,58 --> 0:5:11,755



140
0:5:11,755 --> 0:5:13,85
One of the coolest things about
being at a magician's


141
0:5:13,85 --> 0:5:15,94
convention is you meet
the coolest people.


142
0:5:15,94 --> 0:5:17,72
And Gene Turner, from Kansas,
City, Missouri--


143
0:5:17,72 --> 0:5:18,16
is that right?


144
0:5:18,16 --> 0:5:19,39
GENE TURNER: Kansas City, yes.


145
0:5:19,39 --> 0:5:22,51
STEVE SPANGLER: And you
have this finger


146
0:5:22,51 --> 0:5:23,34
manipulation kind of thing.


147
0:5:23,34 --> 0:5:25,42
They call it sleight
of hand, right?--


148
0:5:25,42 --> 0:5:26,26
close up magic.


149
0:5:26,26 --> 0:5:26,82
GENE TURNER: Right.


150
0:5:26,82 --> 0:5:27,77
STEVE SPANGLER: You
do that so well.


151
0:5:27,77 --> 0:5:29,37
GENE TURNER: Yeah, my favorite
thing is to go ahead and


152
0:5:29,37 --> 0:5:29,955
remove these.


153
0:5:29,955 --> 0:5:32,62
It'll sound louder to you, so go
ahead and get those out of


154
0:5:32,62 --> 0:5:33,75
there for you.


155
0:5:33,75 --> 0:5:36,58
Here, you hold-- never
mind, you're busy.


156
0:5:36,58 --> 0:5:38,1
Just go ahead and hold your
hand out here for me.


157
0:5:38,1 --> 0:5:39,41
You can put that one away.


158
0:5:39,41 --> 0:5:40,98
Now, I have two red balls.


159
0:5:40,98 --> 0:5:41,64
My hand's [INAUDIBLE].


160
0:5:41,64 --> 0:5:43,62
I have no sleeves,
actually, today.


161
0:5:43,62 --> 0:5:45,91
I will go slowly, but if you
blink, you will miss it.


162
0:5:45,91 --> 0:5:47,72
Close it tightly--
just one ball.


163
0:5:47,72 --> 0:5:48,565
Put it right up here.


164
0:5:48,565 --> 0:5:50,22
[INTERPOSING VOICES]


165
0:5:50,22 --> 0:5:51,24
GENE TURNER: How many
in the hand?


166
0:5:51,24 --> 0:5:51,89
STEVE SPANGLER: One.


167
0:5:51,89 --> 0:5:52,525
GENE TURNER: How many in mine?


168
0:5:52,525 --> 0:5:53,31
STEVE SPANGLER: One.


169
0:5:53,31 --> 0:5:54,64
GENE TURNER: Now, mine goes
right through your elbow.


170
0:5:54,64 --> 0:5:55,4
My hands are empty.


171
0:5:55,4 --> 0:5:56,62
Check it out.


172
0:5:56,62 --> 0:5:57,71
Just one.


173
0:5:57,71 --> 0:5:57,99
Right.


174
0:5:57,99 --> 0:5:58,72
See, I'm a man of my word.


175
0:5:58,72 --> 0:6:1,41
I said mine would go through
your elbow, and mine went


176
0:6:1,41 --> 0:6:2,57
right through your elbow.


177
0:6:2,57 --> 0:6:3,15
Hands out.


178
0:6:3,15 --> 0:6:3,86
I went too quickly.


179
0:6:3,86 --> 0:6:5,8
I'll slow it down.


180
0:6:5,8 --> 0:6:5,96
Two hands empty.


181
0:6:5,96 --> 0:6:6,64
I'll hold this one.


182
0:6:6,64 --> 0:6:7,59
You hold that one tightly.


183
0:6:7,59 --> 0:6:9,59
Now, this one goes
to my pocket.


184
0:6:9,59 --> 0:6:11,45
It really goes down
there, see?


185
0:6:11,45 --> 0:6:12,5
The hand's empty.


186
0:6:12,5 --> 0:6:13,42
Watch that elbow--


187
0:6:13,42 --> 0:6:15,9
scientific principle--
centrifugal force.


188
0:6:15,9 --> 0:6:17,97
You feel anything go in,
anything leave, let me know.


189
0:6:17,97 --> 0:6:19,6
Put both hands together.


190
0:6:19,6 --> 0:6:20,92
How many red balls
in your hand?


191
0:6:20,92 --> 0:6:21,91
STEVE SPANGLER: Two.


192
0:6:21,91 --> 0:6:22,76
GENE TURNER: Right.


193
0:6:22,76 --> 0:6:23,8
Absolutely.


194
0:6:23,8 --> 0:6:24,19
Now, there are two.


195
0:6:24,19 --> 0:6:26,7
See, this one goes in,
that one goes in.


196
0:6:26,7 --> 0:6:27,66
How many here, again?


197
0:6:27,66 --> 0:6:28,1
I went too quickly.


198
0:6:28,1 --> 0:6:31,14
STEVE SPANGLER: I--I--I
All right.


199
0:6:31,14 --> 0:6:31,72
I'm confused.


200
0:6:31,72 --> 0:6:32,87
GENE TURNER: I don't
understand it.


201
0:6:32,87 --> 0:6:33,83
I don't understand it.


202
0:6:33,83 --> 0:6:35,38
Well, listen, I was going
to let you know,


203
0:6:35,38 --> 0:6:36,21
too, I found this.


204
0:6:36,21 --> 0:6:39,25
I don't know if you've seen
that around, but I'm sorry


205
0:6:39,25 --> 0:6:39,76
about that.


206
0:6:39,76 --> 0:6:41,57
It's just kind of a habit.


207
0:6:41,57 --> 0:6:43,593
We'll go ahead and put
that back on there.


208
0:6:43,593 --> 0:6:45,23
STEVE SPANGLER: He
stole my watch.


209
0:6:45,23 --> 0:6:46,2
GENE TURNER: There you go.


210
0:6:46,2 --> 0:6:46,65
All right.


211
0:6:46,65 --> 0:6:48,7
Do you have anything
in the [INAUDIBL


212
0:6:48,7 --> 0:6:48,66
STEVE SPANGLER: Yes, I have


213
0:6:48,66 --> 0:6:49,19
--pocket over there.


214
0:6:49,19 --> 0:6:50,9
OK, something over there.


215
0:6:50,9 --> 0:6:51,43
That's great.


216
0:6:51,43 --> 0:6:52,295
OK.


217
0:6:52,295 --> 0:6:53,14
Well, I'll tell you what.


218
0:6:53,14 --> 0:6:54,88
I'm going to try to take the
watch again in five seconds.


219
0:6:54,88 --> 0:6:57,53
Time it-- five, four, three--


220
0:6:57,53 --> 0:6:58,59
that was so close.


221
0:6:58,59 --> 0:6:59,59
That was so close.


222
0:6:59,59 --> 0:7:0,1
Now--


223
0:7:0,1 --> 0:7:1,45
STEVE SPANGLER: Can
I have my watch?


224
0:7:1,45 --> 0:7:3,7
GENE TURNER: Oh, no, but
your wallet, I can give


225
0:7:3,7 --> 0:7:3,66
that back to you.


226
0:7:3,66 --> 0:7:4,16
I'm sorry.


227
0:7:4,16 --> 0:7:6,77
I didn't mean to-- that wallet
came out of this pocket right


228
0:7:6,77 --> 0:7:8,275
down here, but you can put
it wherever you'd like.


229
0:7:8,275 --> 0:7:8,785
STEVE SPANGLER: Gosh.


230
0:7:8,785 --> 0:7:10,2
GENE TURNER: Yeah, oh,
and I'm sorry.


231
0:7:10,2 --> 0:7:10,86
I got the watch again.


232
0:7:10,86 --> 0:7:11,21
STEVE SPANGLER: Ahhh!


233
0:7:11,21 --> 0:7:11,56
GENE TURNER: You're right.


234
0:7:11,56 --> 0:7:14,192
I probably should put that
back on there for you.


235
0:7:14,192 --> 0:7:14,95
STEVE SPANGLER: All right.


236
0:7:14,95 --> 0:7:15,64
GENE TURNER: There Ever go.


237
0:7:15,64 --> 0:7:17,2
Now, I want to make sure
that's buckled,


238
0:7:17,2 --> 0:7:18,18
and on there good.


239
0:7:18,18 --> 0:7:18,48
STEVE SPANGLER: Yes.


240
0:7:18,48 --> 0:7:18,95
You should use--


241
0:7:18,95 --> 0:7:19,78
GENE TURNER: Buckled
through the loops?


242
0:7:19,78 --> 0:7:20,0
STEVE SPANGLER: Yes,
it's buckled.


243
0:7:20,0 --> 0:7:21,88
GENE TURNER: OK, you concentrate
on it, all right?


244
0:7:21,88 --> 0:7:23,53
Bring your right hand
over, and hold this.


245
0:7:23,53 --> 0:7:23,87
STEVE SPANGLER: Ahh!


246
0:7:23,87 --> 0:7:24,6
GENE TURNER: All right.


247
0:7:24,6 --> 0:7:25,16
We'll get started again.


248
0:7:25,16 --> 0:7:25,865
STEVE SPANGLER: Oh!


249
0:7:25,865 --> 0:7:26,22
GENE TURNER: [INAUDIBLE].


250
0:7:26,22 --> 0:7:26,72
STEVE SPANGLER: All right.


251
0:7:26,72 --> 0:7:28,21
I'm putting it on myself.


252
0:7:28,21 --> 0:7:30,43
At a magic convention, just
like any other convention,


253
0:7:30,43 --> 0:7:32,2
there's a trade show
room, right?


254
0:7:32,2 --> 0:7:34,86
So this is called the dealers'
room or the exhibit hall.


255
0:7:34,86 --> 0:7:38,16
So this is where magicians go
around from table to table and


256
0:7:38,16 --> 0:7:41,26
they watch other magicians sell
tricks so that they can


257
0:7:41,26 --> 0:7:42,21
put them in their acts.


258
0:7:42,21 --> 0:7:46,22
And one of the most genius minds
that's out there right


259
0:7:46,22 --> 0:7:48,18
now is a gentleman by the
name of Losander.


260
0:7:48,18 --> 0:7:50,46
And he just does
amazing things.


261
0:7:50,46 --> 0:7:52,54
All you have to do is watch,
and you're amazed.


262
0:7:52,54 --> 0:7:52,9
Welcome.


263
0:7:52,9 --> 0:7:53,33
LOSANDER: [INAUDIBLE]


264
0:7:53,33 --> 0:7:54,71
STEVE SPANGLER: And will you
show me something very cool?


265
0:7:54,71 --> 0:7:55,175
LOSANDER: Yeah.


266
0:7:55,175 --> 0:7:56,105
Check out the chain.


267
0:7:56,105 --> 0:7:57,5
Is it really solid?


268
0:7:57,5 --> 0:7:58,57
STEVE SPANGLER: It is.


269
0:7:58,57 --> 0:8:2,3
LOSANDER: Now, this here,
as you really can see is


270
0:8:2,3 --> 0:8:2,89
electrical tape.


271
0:8:2,89 --> 0:8:4,84
OK, so my plan is very simple.


272
0:8:4,84 --> 0:8:8,7
I take a piece of the
electrical tape.


273
0:8:8,7 --> 0:8:11,32
I'm to going to tie these two
fingers together, and I'm


274
0:8:11,32 --> 0:8:13,736
going to do this as tight
as even possible.


275
0:8:13,736 --> 0:8:16,14
Watch.


276
0:8:16,14 --> 0:8:16,82
Check it out.


277
0:8:16,82 --> 0:8:17,675
Is it really tight?


278
0:8:17,675 --> 0:8:18,29
STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah.


279
0:8:18,29 --> 0:8:19,46
Your fingers are turning red.


280
0:8:19,46 --> 0:8:20,38
LOSANDER: Right, it's
turning red.


281
0:8:20,38 --> 0:8:22,78
They will turn blue so
we have to hurry up.


282
0:8:22,78 --> 0:8:24,65
On the count of three, OK?


283
0:8:24,65 --> 0:8:27,226
One, two, three.


284
0:8:27,226 --> 0:8:29,69
STEVE SPANGLER: I'm standing
right here.


285
0:8:29,69 --> 0:8:32,309
I'm standing in the spot the
magician doesn't want you.


286
0:8:32,309 --> 0:8:34,26
I mean, I'm right
in front of him.


287
0:8:34,26 --> 0:8:35,47
LOSANDER: Yeah, it's all
in there, right?


288
0:8:35,47 --> 0:8:36,25
STEVE SPANGLER: It
is in there.


289
0:8:36,25 --> 0:8:37,361
LOSANDER: Now, for most people,
that was a little


290
0:8:37,361 --> 0:8:38,92
fast, so let's do it again.


291
0:8:38,92 --> 0:8:40,84
Let's pretend we [INAUDIBLE].


292
0:8:40,84 --> 0:8:42,365
STEVE SPANGLER: Wait, hold on.


293
0:8:42,365 --> 0:8:43,324
LOSANDER: Is that
a real thumb?


294
0:8:43,324 --> 0:8:43,84
Check this out.


295
0:8:43,84 --> 0:8:44,606
STEVE SPANGLER: Yes,
it's a real thumb.


296
0:8:44,606 --> 0:8:46,87
LOSANDER: Look, I'm going to
penetrate that thumb for you.


297
0:8:46,87 --> 0:8:48,196
STEVE SPANGLER: Thank you.


298
0:8:48,196 --> 0:8:49,2
LOSANDER: It's going to hurt.


299
0:8:49,2 --> 0:8:49,91
STEVE SPANGLER: It's going
to hurt you, right?


300
0:8:49,91 --> 0:8:52,84
LOSANDER: One, two, and three.


301
0:8:52,84 --> 0:8:54,45
It goes right through.


302
0:8:54,45 --> 0:8:55,584
Here, please hold the chains.


303
0:8:55,584 --> 0:8:57,9
One of these days,
I'll teach you.


304
0:8:57,9 --> 0:9:1,674
Meanwhile, you are the only guy
at this convention who can


305
0:9:1,674 --> 0:9:4,446
actually keep the
electrical tape.


306
0:9:4,446 --> 0:9:5,895
[CHUCKLING]


307
0:9:5,895 --> 0:9:7,827
STEVE SPANGLER: It's
really good.


308
0:9:7,827 --> 0:9:8,793
This guy is good.


309
0:9:8,793 --> 0:9:11,6
The cool thing is you
get to meet a


310
0:9:11,6 --> 0:9:12,6
bunch of cool magicians.


311
0:9:12,6 --> 0:9:14,22
I've known Danny Archer here
for years, and years, and


312
0:9:14,22 --> 0:9:17,42
years-- probably 30 years
doing magic, not only


313
0:9:17,42 --> 0:9:20,91
performing magic, but being
able to teach a


314
0:9:20,91 --> 0:9:21,3
little bit, as well.


315
0:9:21,3 --> 0:9:24,12
And I asked if maybe you'd teach
us a trick, but I want


316
0:9:24,12 --> 0:9:25,77
you to blow us away first.


317
0:9:25,77 --> 0:9:26,23
Show me a magic trick.


318
0:9:26,23 --> 0:9:27,34
DANNY ARCHER: All right, we'll
do a trick first, and then


319
0:9:27,34 --> 0:9:28,1
we'll teach you one.


320
0:9:28,1 --> 0:9:30,225
Do you have some change--
a quarter, maybe?


321
0:9:30,225 --> 0:9:31,98
STEVE SPANGLER: I
have a quarter.


322
0:9:31,98 --> 0:9:34,14
DANNY ARCHER: Do
you have a pen?


323
0:9:34,14 --> 0:9:35,2
STEVE SPANGLER: I thought you
were going to ask for a


324
0:9:35,2 --> 0:9:35,35
hundred dollar bill.


325
0:9:35,35 --> 0:9:35,79
DANNY ARCHER: No.


326
0:9:35,79 --> 0:9:36,66
STEVE SPANGLER: I don't
have that have that.


327
0:9:36,66 --> 0:9:37,5
I have a pen.


328
0:9:37,5 --> 0:9:37,79
DANNY ARCHER: OK, cool.


329
0:9:37,79 --> 0:9:40,19
Here's what's going to happen,
on the count of three, the


330
0:9:40,19 --> 0:9:41,235
coin is going to disappear.


331
0:9:41,235 --> 0:9:43,51
Don't take your eyes
off that coin.


332
0:9:43,51 --> 0:9:46,52
One, two, three.


333
0:9:46,52 --> 0:9:48,89
Oh, you see the quarter didn't
disappear, but [INAUDIBLE].


334
0:9:48,89 --> 0:9:49,59
STEVE SPANGLER: Where's
the pen?


335
0:9:49,59 --> 0:9:50,24
DANNY ARCHER: No, I'm kidding.


336
0:9:50,24 --> 0:9:50,67
Right there.


337
0:9:50,67 --> 0:9:51,37
If you look right there.


338
0:9:51,37 --> 0:9:52,0
There's the--


339
0:9:52,0 --> 0:9:52,7
STEVE SPANGLER: How
cool is that?


340
0:9:52,7 --> 0:9:52,63
DANNY ARCHER: Watch the coin.


341
0:9:52,63 --> 0:9:55,72
This time the coin will
disappear for real.


342
0:9:55,72 --> 0:9:57,4
STEVE SPANGLER: That is cool.


343
0:9:57,4 --> 0:9:58,405
DANNY ARCHER: Do you want
your quarter back?


344
0:9:58,405 --> 0:9:59,66
STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah, I guess.


345
0:9:59,66 --> 0:10:0,19
DANNY ARCHER: Sometimes
they [INAUDIBLE]--


346
0:10:0,19 --> 0:10:1,44
hold on a minute.


347
0:10:1,44 --> 0:10:3,452



348
0:10:3,452 --> 0:10:5,56
STEVE SPANGLER: Look at this.


349
0:10:5,56 --> 0:10:6,78
Get out of here.


350
0:10:6,78 --> 0:10:7,235
[GASPING]


351
0:10:7,235 --> 0:10:8,155
DANNY ARCHER: You
want it back?


352
0:10:8,155 --> 0:10:9,83
STEVE SPANGLER: How in the--


353
0:10:9,83 --> 0:10:11,6
that is totally good.


354
0:10:11,6 --> 0:10:12,7
Now, you're really going to
teach us how to do this?


355
0:10:12,7 --> 0:10:13,51
DANNY ARCHER: I'm going to teach
you how to do that--


356
0:10:13,51 --> 0:10:15,86
really easy to do.


357
0:10:15,86 --> 0:10:16,805
You need--


358
0:10:16,805 --> 0:10:19,29
I had one quarter already
in my shoe.


359
0:10:19,29 --> 0:10:19,68
STEVE SPANGLER: Get
out of here.


360
0:10:19,68 --> 0:10:20,84
DANNY ARCHER: So when I
get up in the morning.


361
0:10:20,84 --> 0:10:22,36
You put a quarter
in each shoe.


362
0:10:22,36 --> 0:10:23,44
You're ready to do
this two times.


363
0:10:23,44 --> 0:10:25,0
STEVE SPANGLER: Have you figured
this out?-- magicians


364
0:10:25,0 --> 0:10:28,39
are liars, so they lie a little
bit, but that's OK.


365
0:10:28,39 --> 0:10:29,33
DANNY ARCHER: We lie a lot.


366
0:10:29,33 --> 0:10:29,925
STEVE SPANGLER: You lie a lot.


367
0:10:29,925 --> 0:10:31,2
DANNY ARCHER: So you [INAUDIBLE]
the coin.


368
0:10:31,2 --> 0:10:32,45
STEVE SPANGLER: So you start
with the coin here.


369
0:10:32,45 --> 0:10:33,15
DANNY ARCHER: One
is in the shoe.


370
0:10:33,15 --> 0:10:34,12
One is in each shoe.


371
0:10:34,12 --> 0:10:35,24
STEVE SPANGLER: And this is
what you borrowed from me.


372
0:10:35,24 --> 0:10:37,2
DANNY ARCHER: I borrowed the
coin, I borrowed the pen.


373
0:10:37,2 --> 0:10:39,91
So I turn my body a little
bit, because I'm going to


374
0:10:39,91 --> 0:10:43,33
secretly leave the pen behind
my ear, and if I did that


375
0:10:43,33 --> 0:10:46,54
here, they would see that, so
I turn my body a little bit,


376
0:10:46,54 --> 0:10:48,78
but I put all the focus
on the pen.


377
0:10:48,78 --> 0:10:50,42
STEVE SPANGLER: And I'm
looking down here.


378
0:10:50,42 --> 0:10:52,3
DANNY ARCHER: And I bent over a
little bit, too, on purpose.


379
0:10:52,3 --> 0:10:54,29
That forces you down
a little bit.


380
0:10:54,29 --> 0:10:56,31
So what I do is I come
here, and I tap my


381
0:10:56,31 --> 0:10:58,28
nail or tap the pen.


382
0:10:58,28 --> 0:11:0,255
And I'll just show you, here
is the exposed view.


383
0:11:0,255 --> 0:11:3,14
I put it behind my ear one--


384
0:11:3,14 --> 0:11:4,86
behind the ear--


385
0:11:4,86 --> 0:11:5,79
two--


386
0:11:5,79 --> 0:11:8,23
behind the ear-- leave
it-- three.


387
0:11:8,23 --> 0:11:12,22
But that all happens when I'm
here, so I come down.


388
0:11:12,22 --> 0:11:15,6
Now I come up a little bit,
and I'm holding this here.


389
0:11:15,6 --> 0:11:15,77
STEVE SPANGLER: I see it.


390
0:11:15,77 --> 0:11:17,8
DANNY ARCHER: So keep
the camera here.


391
0:11:17,8 --> 0:11:21,19
As I start to turn around, and
I point right here, this hand


392
0:11:21,19 --> 0:11:22,84
goes to the edge of
the pocket and I--


393
0:11:22,84 --> 0:11:24,51
STEVE SPANGLER: You just
drop it in your pocket.


394
0:11:24,51 --> 0:11:26,91
DANNY ARCHER: I just drop it
in my pocket, but all the


395
0:11:26,91 --> 0:11:28,54
attention is right here.


396
0:11:28,54 --> 0:11:31,16
Now, I take this off, but
I say, watch the coin.


397
0:11:31,16 --> 0:11:32,6
I have no coin.


398
0:11:32,6 --> 0:11:35,13
I'm tapping my thumbnail just to
make a little bit of noise


399
0:11:35,13 --> 0:11:35,65
right there.


400
0:11:35,65 --> 0:11:37,82
He can't hear it, but-- so
I say, watch the coin.


401
0:11:37,82 --> 0:11:41,18
This time it disappears, and I
just flick this off the top of


402
0:11:41,18 --> 0:11:43,236
the nail for real.


403
0:11:43,236 --> 0:11:45,2
So now the coin is gone.


404
0:11:45,2 --> 0:11:46,39
You give the guy the pen back.


405
0:11:46,39 --> 0:11:47,21
You say, do you want it back?


406
0:11:47,21 --> 0:11:50,77
Now, I didn't have one in both
shoes, but usually, if you do,


407
0:11:50,77 --> 0:11:52,35
I say pick a foot.


408
0:11:52,35 --> 0:11:54,35
STEVE SPANGLER: And see, that's
what blows you away is


409
0:11:54,35 --> 0:11:55,9
that you go, no--


410
0:11:55,9 --> 0:11:55,42
DANNY ARCHER: Pick a foot.


411
0:11:55,42 --> 0:11:56,1
STEVE SPANGLER: --how
did you--


412
0:11:56,1 --> 0:11:57,34
I want this foot right here.


413
0:11:57,34 --> 0:11:58,86
DANNY ARCHER: I stamp
the foot like that.


414
0:11:58,86 --> 0:12:0,7
I show my hands empty.


415
0:12:0,7 --> 0:12:1,8
I come down.


416
0:12:1,8 --> 0:12:3,53
I shake it down like that.


417
0:12:3,53 --> 0:12:5,23
I let them see it
inside the shoe.


418
0:12:5,23 --> 0:12:7,83
Now, a lot of times, they don't
want the coin back.


419
0:12:7,83 --> 0:12:8,24
STEVE SPANGLER: No.


420
0:12:8,24 --> 0:12:10,39
DANNY ARCHER: So you do this
10,000 times, you can buy


421
0:12:10,39 --> 0:12:11,534
yourself a new car.


422
0:12:11,534 --> 0:12:11,961
STEVE SPANGLER: Oh.


423
0:12:11,961 --> 0:12:12,61
All right.


424
0:12:12,61 --> 0:12:14,48
So the deal is is how many
times do you think you've


425
0:12:14,48 --> 0:12:17,53
performed this until you felt
really good at doing it?


426
0:12:17,53 --> 0:12:19,84
DANNY ARCHER: Probably
after 20--


427
0:12:19,84 --> 0:12:21,75
30 times.


428
0:12:21,75 --> 0:12:23,5
I've done it thousands
of times.


429
0:12:23,5 --> 0:12:25,8
It's a great trick to
do when someone


430
0:12:25,8 --> 0:12:26,34
says, do a trick, Danny.


431
0:12:26,34 --> 0:12:28,235
I have none of my props on me.


432
0:12:28,235 --> 0:12:28,59
STEVE SPANGLER: You
can just do it.


433
0:12:28,59 --> 0:12:30,22
DANNY ARCHER: Do you
have a coin?


434
0:12:30,22 --> 0:12:30,9
It doesn't have to be a coin.


435
0:12:30,9 --> 0:12:33,745
It could be a bill, it can
be another small object.


436
0:12:33,745 --> 0:12:37,15
Do you have a pen, a straw, a
crayon-- it could be anything.


437
0:12:37,15 --> 0:12:37,254
STEVE SPANGLER: All right.


438
0:12:37,254 --> 0:12:38,5
Let's challenge our
YouTube viewers.


439
0:12:38,5 --> 0:12:39,67
Here's what I want to do.


440
0:12:39,67 --> 0:12:42,45
You just saw Danny Archer, an
amazing magician, do this.


441
0:12:42,45 --> 0:12:43,13
He taught you how to do it.


442
0:12:43,13 --> 0:12:44,56
I want you to do it.


443
0:12:44,56 --> 0:12:46,9
Get somebody to videotape you
doing it in front of a group


444
0:12:46,9 --> 0:12:49,45
of kids at school, at work,
wherever you are.


445
0:12:49,45 --> 0:12:51,49
Post it, and send it
to us, and we'll


446
0:12:51,49 --> 0:12:52,37
feature it on the channel.


447
0:12:52,37 --> 0:12:54,28
We're going to pick the best
one, and we'll feature it on


448
0:12:54,28 --> 0:12:54,74
the channel.


449
0:12:54,74 --> 0:12:55,176
DANNY ARCHER: [INAUDIBLE].


450
0:12:55,176 --> 0:12:55,612
STEVE SPANGLER: Fair enough?


451
0:12:55,612 --> 0:12:56,5
All right.


452
0:12:56,5 --> 0:12:57,35
OK, that's your homework.


453
0:12:57,35 --> 0:12:58,27
Thank you.


454
0:12:58,27 --> 0:12:58,996
Nice job.


455
0:12:58,996 --> 0:13:0,24
DANNY ARCHER: [INAUDIBLE]


456
0:13:0,24 --> 0:13:2,47
STEVE SPANGLER: All right,
no-- away I'm done, OK.


457
0:13:2,47 --> 0:13:3,175
I'm going to the bathroom.


458
0:13:3,175 --> 0:13:4,425
Don't follow me in.


459
0:13:4,425 --> 0:13:9,846



460
0:13:9,846 --> 0:13:14,34
How many times did I tell you
no, not in the bathroom.


461
0:13:14,34 --> 0:13:15,866
All right?


462
0:13:15,866 --> 0:13:17,653
It's a zero kind of thing.


463
0:13:17,653 --> 0:13:18,535
Hey, Eddie.


464
0:13:18,535 --> 0:13:21,392
EDDIE: What's happening,
Steve?


465
0:13:21,392 --> 0:13:22,42
STEVE SPANGLER: This is
going to be good.


466
0:13:22,42 --> 0:13:24,97
EDDIE: This is a great
convention, isn't it?


467
0:13:24,97 --> 0:13:26,333
STEVE SPANGLER: Do
a trick for me.


468
0:13:26,333 --> 0:13:27,2
EDDIE: [INAUDIBLE].


469
0:13:27,2 --> 0:13:29,755
STEVE SPANGLER: If you're a
real magician, do a trick.


470
0:13:29,755 --> 0:13:31,155
EDDIE: I can do that.


471
0:13:31,155 --> 0:13:31,81
I can do that.


472
0:13:31,81 --> 0:13:34,26
Would you like me to teach you
to the trick or just do it?


473
0:13:34,26 --> 0:13:35,5
This is a great one.


474
0:13:35,5 --> 0:13:36,76
STEVE SPANGLER: Do you know
we're going to be in trouble


475
0:13:36,76 --> 0:13:38,14
for having cameras
in the restroom.


476
0:13:38,14 --> 0:13:38,83
It's just--


477
0:13:38,83 --> 0:13:39,974
EDDIE: It's OK.


478
0:13:39,974 --> 0:13:40,83
It's all right.


479
0:13:40,83 --> 0:13:42,79
This is one of my favorites.


480
0:13:42,79 --> 0:13:46,3
It's the torn restored
handkerchief trick--


481
0:13:46,3 --> 0:13:46,82
napkin trick.


482
0:13:46,82 --> 0:13:51,21
And what you do is before you
start, you crumple one of them


483
0:13:51,21 --> 0:13:54,52
up, and you put it
in that hand.


484
0:13:54,52 --> 0:13:55,135
They don't know about it.


485
0:13:55,135 --> 0:13:56,25
STEVE SPANGLER: So you're
teaching this?


486
0:13:56,25 --> 0:13:57,2
EDDIE: I'm going to show
you how to do it.


487
0:13:57,2 --> 0:13:58,59
This is great, because we're
in the bathroom.


488
0:13:58,59 --> 0:13:59,49
No one's watching.


489
0:13:59,49 --> 0:13:59,64
STEVE SPANGLER: This
is awesome.


490
0:13:59,64 --> 0:14:0,625
You're learning how to
do a magic trick


491
0:14:0,625 --> 0:14:1,38
in the men's bathroom.


492
0:14:1,38 --> 0:14:3,632
EDDIE: So what you do, is
see, now, this looks


493
0:14:3,632 --> 0:14:4,28
a little bit fishy.


494
0:14:4,28 --> 0:14:5,26
STEVE SPANGLER: [INAUDIBLE],
all right.


495
0:14:5,26 --> 0:14:6,345
DANNY ARCHER: This
looks fishy.


496
0:14:6,345 --> 0:14:8,4
See how my hand--


497
0:14:8,4 --> 0:14:12,2
if I say I want to borrow one of
these papers, when you hold


498
0:14:12,2 --> 0:14:15,52
it, it's not so obvious that
there's something in there,


499
0:14:15,52 --> 0:14:17,67
especially if you hold
the other hand


500
0:14:17,67 --> 0:14:18,86
sort of the same way.


501
0:14:18,86 --> 0:14:19,48
You know what I mean?


502
0:14:19,48 --> 0:14:19,83
STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah.


503
0:14:19,83 --> 0:14:22,2
DANNY ARCHER: And you also
need a magic wand.


504
0:14:22,2 --> 0:14:23,625
STEVE SPANGLER: I've
got a magic--


505
0:14:23,625 --> 0:14:24,73
EDDIE: No, no, no.


506
0:14:24,73 --> 0:14:25,8
STEVE SPANGLER: What,
you got one?


507
0:14:25,8 --> 0:14:26,5
EDDIE: I've got a little--


508
0:14:26,5 --> 0:14:26,954
STEVE SPANGLER: Look at you.


509
0:14:26,954 --> 0:14:27,406
All right.


510
0:14:27,406 --> 0:14:29,42
EDDIE: Yeah, I'll tell you,
I'm like ready to go here.


511
0:14:29,42 --> 0:14:32,69
So what you do is you
start ripping up


512
0:14:32,69 --> 0:14:33,97
this paper like this.


513
0:14:33,97 --> 0:14:35,23
STEVE SPANGLER: If somebody
says, let me see a trick, you


514
0:14:35,23 --> 0:14:36,95
just grab a napkin--


515
0:14:36,95 --> 0:14:37,72
EDDIE: --and you just
stick that in there.


516
0:14:37,72 --> 0:14:38,81
They don't know about that.


517
0:14:38,81 --> 0:14:41,75
And you're ripping this up,
and you're doing all this


518
0:14:41,75 --> 0:14:44,42
stuff, and you squeeze
it down.


519
0:14:44,42 --> 0:14:47,38
So they know about this, but
they don't know about that.


520
0:14:47,38 --> 0:14:48,12
STEVE SPANGLER: They
have no idea.


521
0:14:48,12 --> 0:14:48,42
EDDIE: OK.


522
0:14:48,42 --> 0:14:49,57
So you're standing there.


523
0:14:49,57 --> 0:14:51,11
You take it in this hand.


524
0:14:51,11 --> 0:14:52,48
Now, here's the cool part.


525
0:14:52,48 --> 0:14:54,53
When you get the magic wand--


526
0:14:54,53 --> 0:14:59,27
now, check over there-- see how
I'm switching those two?


527
0:14:59,27 --> 0:15:7,32
You just go and tap like that,
and then this blows them away.


528
0:15:7,32 --> 0:15:8,575
You go like that--


529
0:15:8,575 --> 0:15:10,1
STEVE SPANGLER: All right,
so the wand is the total


530
0:15:10,1 --> 0:15:10,665
misdirection.


531
0:15:10,665 --> 0:15:13,46
EDDIE: That's it,
and that's it.


532
0:15:13,46 --> 0:15:15,7
STEVE SPANGLER: OK,
but if you're--


533
0:15:15,7 --> 0:15:18,18
I'm just going to tell you this
from one kind of magician


534
0:15:18,18 --> 0:15:21,1
to another professional
magician, I can see it


535
0:15:21,1 --> 0:15:21,79
in that hand, so--


536
0:15:21,79 --> 0:15:22,4
EDDIE: You can see that?


537
0:15:22,4 --> 0:15:22,74
STEVE SPANGLER: Yes.


538
0:15:22,74 --> 0:15:24,3
But you gotta have-- if you're
doing this at home, you


539
0:15:24,3 --> 0:15:24,65
[INAUDIBLE]--


540
0:15:24,65 --> 0:15:25,45
EDDIE: There's no problem.


541
0:15:25,45 --> 0:15:25,98
STEVE SPANGLER: What?


542
0:15:25,98 --> 0:15:28,767
EDDIE: What you do is
you just go in, tap


543
0:15:28,767 --> 0:15:32,26
that, and that one--


544
0:15:32,26 --> 0:15:33,55
STEVE SPANGLER: Holy cow.


545
0:15:33,55 --> 0:15:34,885
EDDIE: --goes back
[INAUDIBLE]--


546
0:15:34,885 --> 0:15:38,564
STEVE SPANGLER: I have a
feeling we've been had.


547
0:15:38,564 --> 0:15:39,32
[SIGHING]


548
0:15:39,32 --> 0:15:39,968
EDDIE: Huh.


549
0:15:39,968 --> 0:15:40,436
STEVE SPANGLER: What
a surprise.


550
0:15:40,436 --> 0:15:42,776
EDDIE: It's getting
stuffy in here.


551
0:15:42,776 --> 0:15:43,712
STEVE SPANGLER: OK.


552
0:15:43,712 --> 0:15:45,44
Oh, sorry sir.


553
0:15:45,44 --> 0:15:47,42
STEVE SPANGLER: Magicians who
do stuff with money is


554
0:15:47,42 --> 0:15:50,5
fantastic, but it scares me, so
when Sean [INAUDIBLE] said,


555
0:15:50,5 --> 0:15:50,94
do you have some money?--


556
0:15:50,94 --> 0:15:54,35
I thought, I do have a dollar
if you want a dollar.


557
0:15:54,35 --> 0:15:55,47
SEAN: Yes, can I borrow
some money?


558
0:15:55,47 --> 0:15:55,87
STEVE SPANGLER: Absolutely.


559
0:15:55,87 --> 0:15:56,25
SEAN: That'd be great.


560
0:15:56,25 --> 0:15:57,68
STEVE SPANGLER: See, this is
where they ask me can I have


561
0:15:57,68 --> 0:15:58,873
some money.


562
0:15:58,873 --> 0:16:0,14
SEAN: Oh, great.


563
0:16:0,14 --> 0:16:1,81
Oh, it looks like you
have more than--


564
0:16:1,81 --> 0:16:2,86
you actually--


565
0:16:2,86 --> 0:16:5,28
STEVE SPANGLER: I was hoping
that you would pick a dollar.


566
0:16:5,28 --> 0:16:6,76
SEAN: Yeah, well, no,
that's perfect.


567
0:16:6,76 --> 0:16:7,18
Cool.


568
0:16:7,18 --> 0:16:8,9
Now if I could have some car
keys, that would be--


569
0:16:8,9 --> 0:16:11,12
STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah, no, Gene
Turner's got the car keys.


570
0:16:11,12 --> 0:16:14,84
SEAN: All right, so we have
looks like five bucks here.


571
0:16:14,84 --> 0:16:16,18
STEVE SPANGLER: You can
see I'm a big spender.


572
0:16:16,18 --> 0:16:18,71
SEAN: You are, yeah.


573
0:16:18,71 --> 0:16:21,13
But let's face it, you
can't go very far


574
0:16:21,13 --> 0:16:21,715
with five bucks, right?


575
0:16:21,715 --> 0:16:23,705
STEVE SPANGLER: Yes, it's my
allowance for the week, so--


576
0:16:23,705 --> 0:16:26,19
SEAN: The value menu's not
even a value these days.


577
0:16:26,19 --> 0:16:27,39
But this is what I do.


578
0:16:27,39 --> 0:16:30,6
OK, watch.


579
0:16:30,6 --> 0:16:30,79
OK, ready?


580
0:16:30,79 --> 0:16:31,55
STEVE SPANGLER: Yes.


581
0:16:31,55 --> 0:16:31,805
SEAN: Whoosh!


582
0:16:31,805 --> 0:16:33,745
Just like that.


583
0:16:33,745 --> 0:16:35,6
Yeah.


584
0:16:35,6 --> 0:16:38,68
That's $100, $200,
$300, $400--


585
0:16:38,68 --> 0:16:40,36
that's $500 right there.


586
0:16:40,36 --> 0:16:43,33
STEVE SPANGLER: See, if you only
knew where he lived, you


587
0:16:43,33 --> 0:16:45,51
would know what I know, and
that is, I give him five


588
0:16:45,51 --> 0:16:48,37
bucks, he gives me $500,
and the trick is


589
0:16:48,37 --> 0:16:49,51
over, I would assume.


590
0:16:49,51 --> 0:16:51,7
SEAN: Well, let's face it, you
know, because you don't want


591
0:16:51,7 --> 0:16:52,57
to walk around with--


592
0:16:52,57 --> 0:16:54,707
I mean, you want to walk around
with $500, it's just


593
0:16:54,707 --> 0:16:56,37
not a good idea to walk
around with $500.


594
0:16:56,37 --> 0:16:57,83
STEVE SPANGLER: OK, if I've
got five bills, and I'm


595
0:16:57,83 --> 0:16:58,82
walking in here, they're
going to be gone.


596
0:16:58,82 --> 0:17:0,115
SEAN: Have you see this crowd?


597
0:17:0,115 --> 0:17:0,525
STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah,
they're a bunch of


598
0:17:0,525 --> 0:17:1,13
cheaters and stealers.


599
0:17:1,13 --> 0:17:4,17
SEAN: That Gene guy, he'd
totally go for this, which is


600
0:17:4,17 --> 0:17:7,839
why I just carry the ones, and
that way, if I'm mugged, you


601
0:17:7,839 --> 0:17:11,6
know, then I'm only out
five bucks, so--


602
0:17:11,6 --> 0:17:12,359
STEVE SPANGLER: This is--


603
0:17:12,359 --> 0:17:12,75
that's it?


604
0:17:12,75 --> 0:17:13,173
SEAN: There you go.


605
0:17:13,173 --> 0:17:14,19
You can have that.


606
0:17:14,19 --> 0:17:15,52
Get yourself something nice.


607
0:17:15,52 --> 0:17:17,32
STEVE SPANGLER: [SIGHING]


608
0:17:17,32 --> 0:17:19,555
Do you see why it's frustrating
to be at a magic


609
0:17:19,555 --> 0:17:19,89
convention?


610
0:17:19,89 --> 0:17:20,78
SEAN: [CHUCKLING]


611
0:17:20,78 --> 0:17:25,828
LOSANDER: Harry Houdini, right,
in his later years, was


612
0:17:25,828 --> 0:17:28,51
kind of like obsessed with
collecting [INAUDIBLE].


613
0:17:28,51 --> 0:17:30,195
STEVE SPANGLER: Right.


614
0:17:30,195 --> 0:17:31,54
And this is Harry Houdini.


615
0:17:31,54 --> 0:17:32,875
LOSANDER: Yeah, that's
Harry Houdini.


616
0:17:32,875 --> 0:17:34,2
He created this device.


617
0:17:34,2 --> 0:17:36,7
It's like a cabinet-- and
a very simple one.


618
0:17:36,7 --> 0:17:38,935
There is a chalkboard, chalk
hanging on the string.


619
0:17:38,935 --> 0:17:41,45
STEVE SPANGLER: So it's
just a piece of chalk.


620
0:17:41,45 --> 0:17:41,53
LOSANDER: Exactly.


621
0:17:41,53 --> 0:17:44,18
So, of course, we do not want
to necessarily contact his


622
0:17:44,18 --> 0:17:45,6
dead mother--


623
0:17:45,6 --> 0:17:45,496
[CHUCKLING]


624
0:17:45,496 --> 0:17:45,932
but--


625
0:17:45,932 --> 0:17:47,285
STEVE SPANGLER: --because
she would be angry.


626
0:17:47,285 --> 0:17:48,895
LOSANDER: Yeah, she'd
be angry.


627
0:17:48,895 --> 0:17:50,844
If you see a dice, what
number do you see?


628
0:17:50,844 --> 0:17:53,37
STEVE SPANGLER: Like
a regular die?


629
0:17:53,37 --> 0:17:53,915
Number six.


630
0:17:53,915 --> 0:17:54,56
LOSANDER: Number six.


631
0:17:54,56 --> 0:17:57,5
Was that your choice or
did I manipulate you?


632
0:17:57,5 --> 0:17:58,1
STEVE SPANGLER: No.


633
0:17:58,1 --> 0:17:59,7
I just see the number six.


634
0:17:59,7 --> 0:17:59,47
LOSANDER: Right.


635
0:17:59,47 --> 0:18:2,54
This one here is just a cloth.


636
0:18:2,54 --> 0:18:4,63
It has nothing to do with the
trick, per se, but Harry


637
0:18:4,63 --> 0:18:7,505
Houdini used to perform in
complete darkness, so that's


638
0:18:7,505 --> 0:18:10,384
why we're using this to
cover up the cabinet,


639
0:18:10,384 --> 0:18:12,839
OK, just like so.


640
0:18:12,839 --> 0:18:16,59
Now, there was usually a long
meditation involved, but then


641
0:18:16,59 --> 0:18:19,724
he found out, just the simple
word "spirit" would actually


642
0:18:19,724 --> 0:18:22,209
do the trick [INAUDIBLE].


643
0:18:22,209 --> 0:18:25,191
STEVE SPANGLER: Would
you look at that?


644
0:18:25,191 --> 0:18:26,441
Wow.


645
0:18:26,441 --> 0:18:29,68



646
0:18:29,68 --> 0:18:33,21
Absolutely amazing.


647
0:18:33,21 --> 0:18:35,58
I'm here to tell you there are
absolutely no strings.


648
0:18:35,58 --> 0:18:39,948



649
0:18:39,948 --> 0:18:42,403
LOSANDER: And that's quite
unusual because Harry Houdini


650
0:18:42,403 --> 0:18:45,349
could only do this in complete
darkness, but-- ooh!--


651
0:18:45,349 --> 0:18:46,822
sometimes he'd get
carried away.


652
0:18:46,822 --> 0:18:47,804
Gotta be careful.


653
0:18:47,804 --> 0:18:51,241
But that's true to the fact
that he may actually


654
0:18:51,241 --> 0:18:53,696
[INAUDIBLE] contact.


655
0:18:53,696 --> 0:18:54,678
[INAUDIBLE].


656
0:18:54,678 --> 0:18:58,11
STEVE SPANGLER: I'm standing
right here.


657
0:18:58,11 --> 0:18:58,956
LOSANDER: Yeah.


658
0:18:58,956 --> 0:18:59,965
STEVE SPANGLER: You're
amazing.


659
0:18:59,965 --> 0:19:0,38
LOSANDER: Right.


660
0:19:0,38 --> 0:19:0,71
Thank you.


661
0:19:0,71 --> 0:19:2,52
STEVE SPANGLER: And this is why
the people around here at


662
0:19:2,52 --> 0:19:6,876
the table want to have your
secrets, so to speak.


663
0:19:6,876 --> 0:19:7,792
LOSANDER: So to speak, yes.


664
0:19:7,792 --> 0:19:9,17
STEVE SPANGLER: Now you know.


665
0:19:9,17 --> 0:19:10,87
Well, one of the things that
magicians want to do is to


666
0:19:10,87 --> 0:19:13,3
make sure the art is preserved,
and so that's why


667
0:19:13,3 --> 0:19:14,44
they're always attracting
young magicians.


668
0:19:14,44 --> 0:19:17,88
And this young man here, Max
Davidson's, been doing magic


669
0:19:17,88 --> 0:19:19,11
more than half of your life.


670
0:19:19,11 --> 0:19:21,82
So you've been six and a half
years, which means you're 12


671
0:19:21,82 --> 0:19:23,11
years old, right?


672
0:19:23,11 --> 0:19:24,15
Psychic powers.


673
0:19:24,15 --> 0:19:25,457
I can't turn the ones
into hundreds, but


674
0:19:25,457 --> 0:19:27,105
I got psychic powers.


675
0:19:27,105 --> 0:19:28,66
And you have just rope
in your hand.


676
0:19:28,66 --> 0:19:29,58
Show me what you're
going to do.


677
0:19:29,58 --> 0:19:30,32
MAX DAVIDSON: All right.


678
0:19:30,32 --> 0:19:32,82
So this is a cool little
effect with


679
0:19:32,82 --> 0:19:33,75
three pieces of rope.


680
0:19:33,75 --> 0:19:35,56
We have a short rope--


681
0:19:35,56 --> 0:19:37,57
if you check that out--
a long rope--


682
0:19:37,57 --> 0:19:38,5
STEVE SPANGLER: Good,
a long rope.


683
0:19:38,5 --> 0:19:40,31
MAX DAVIDSON: --and
a medium rope.


684
0:19:40,31 --> 0:19:44,65
So if I could just have
the long rope for me.


685
0:19:44,65 --> 0:19:45,87
This is the long rope
right here.


686
0:19:45,87 --> 0:19:47,806
This is the short rope, and then
in your hand, you have


687
0:19:47,806 --> 0:19:48,595
the medium rope.


688
0:19:48,595 --> 0:19:50,24
[INAUDIBLE] see that--
wonderful.


689
0:19:50,24 --> 0:19:51,87
So this is actually
quite interesting.


690
0:19:51,87 --> 0:19:54,69
All we have to do is give the
rope a pull, just like this,


691
0:19:54,69 --> 0:19:57,27
and they change into the
same exact size.


692
0:19:57,27 --> 0:20:0,2
You see, now, the short one is
the same size as the long one,


693
0:20:0,2 --> 0:20:2,55
which is the same size
as the medium rope.


694
0:20:2,55 --> 0:20:3,64
STEVE SPANGLER: I checked them
and they don't stretch.


695
0:20:3,64 --> 0:20:4,87
MAX DAVIDSON: They don't
stretch, do they?


696
0:20:4,87 --> 0:20:7,153
So three ropes is a bit
confusing to follow because


697
0:20:7,153 --> 0:20:9,92
you have two eyes, so we'll
just go with two.


698
0:20:9,92 --> 0:20:11,51
As a matter of fact,
so is two ropes.


699
0:20:11,51 --> 0:20:13,13
That's hard to follow, so
let's just start out


700
0:20:13,13 --> 0:20:14,49
with one, like this.


701
0:20:14,49 --> 0:20:15,5
STEVE SPANGLER: Wow.


702
0:20:15,5 --> 0:20:18,3
MAX DAVIDSON: Now, here's what
I'll do is take the rope and


703
0:20:18,3 --> 0:20:20,32
tie it into a loop,
like this, OK?


704
0:20:20,32 --> 0:20:21,6
I have a ring.


705
0:20:21,6 --> 0:20:22,28
If you could check
that out for me.


706
0:20:22,28 --> 0:20:24,4
It's a solid, good ring?


707
0:20:24,4 --> 0:20:24,71
STEVE SPANGLER: It is.


708
0:20:24,71 --> 0:20:25,41
MAX DAVIDSON: Any holes?


709
0:20:25,41 --> 0:20:26,14
STEVE SPANGLER: No.


710
0:20:26,14 --> 0:20:26,993
MAX DAVIDSON: There's
that one.


711
0:20:26,993 --> 0:20:28,11
STEVE SPANGLER: How
did I know?


712
0:20:28,11 --> 0:20:29,12
MAX DAVIDSON: [INAUDIBLE]
you know that joke.


713
0:20:29,12 --> 0:20:32,27
All right, what we do is take
the knot, just like this.


714
0:20:32,27 --> 0:20:33,59
Place it through the ring.


715
0:20:33,59 --> 0:20:34,3
That's all we have to do.


716
0:20:34,3 --> 0:20:37,8
Give it a blow, and the ring
actually just melts onto the


717
0:20:37,8 --> 0:20:37,86
rope, like that.


718
0:20:37,86 --> 0:20:38,23
STEVE SPANGLER: Wow.


719
0:20:38,23 --> 0:20:39,97
MAX DAVIDSON: Now, it's
really on there.


720
0:20:39,97 --> 0:20:41,36
If you can just give
that a pull.


721
0:20:41,36 --> 0:20:41,92
STEVE SPANGLER: It
is on there.


722
0:20:41,92 --> 0:20:42,26
MAX DAVIDSON: It is.


723
0:20:42,26 --> 0:20:42,85
OK.


724
0:20:42,85 --> 0:20:44,955
So, watch, we can take it
off just as easily.


725
0:20:44,955 --> 0:20:48,19
I'll blow like that, and the
ring is off the rope.


726
0:20:48,19 --> 0:20:51,5
If you want to check that
out again, feel free.


727
0:20:51,5 --> 0:20:52,83
STEVE SPANGLER: The kid's
only 12 years old.


728
0:20:52,83 --> 0:20:54,51
MAX DAVIDSON: Here, let
me show you how I get


729
0:20:54,51 --> 0:20:55,19
the ring on the rope.


730
0:20:55,19 --> 0:20:55,87
This is really cool.


731
0:20:55,87 --> 0:20:59,4
You see, what I do, it's
with the middle.


732
0:20:59,4 --> 0:21:0,896
I just take the middle
off the rope.


733
0:21:0,896 --> 0:21:3,2
Then I take the ring, and I
put it on, and I take the


734
0:21:3,2 --> 0:21:6,8
middle, and I just put
it back on like that.


735
0:21:6,8 --> 0:21:8,26
Now, sometimes the middle won't
come off, so this is


736
0:21:8,26 --> 0:21:11,16
what I have to do, is actually
take the ends off


737
0:21:11,16 --> 0:21:12,58
the road like that.


738
0:21:12,58 --> 0:21:15,35
And that leaves me with an
infinite loop of rope.


739
0:21:15,35 --> 0:21:16,46
You know, it makes no sense.


740
0:21:16,46 --> 0:21:18,14
I've got an infinite
loop of rope.


741
0:21:18,14 --> 0:21:20,87
The funny thing is you can't
really get a knot in an


742
0:21:20,87 --> 0:21:22,14
infinite loop of rope.


743
0:21:22,14 --> 0:21:22,95
STEVE SPANGLER: Wow.


744
0:21:22,95 --> 0:21:24,33
MAX DAVIDSON: --unless you have
ends, which I have in my


745
0:21:24,33 --> 0:21:26,88
pocket, so we'll take those and
stick them on just like


746
0:21:26,88 --> 0:21:29,87
that, so the knot
becomes reality.


747
0:21:29,87 --> 0:21:32,21
Now, here's how you get
the loop of rope.


748
0:21:32,21 --> 0:21:34,32
You just need some static
electricity, so if you get a


749
0:21:34,32 --> 0:21:37,8
little from here and a little
from here, you get that


750
0:21:37,8 --> 0:21:38,16
infinite loop of rope.


751
0:21:38,16 --> 0:21:40,98
Now, you need ends, and I had
those in my pocket, so we'll


752
0:21:40,98 --> 0:21:44,7
take the ends and just put them
on the rope like that.


753
0:21:44,7 --> 0:21:45,88
I'll show you that again
in slow motion.


754
0:21:45,88 --> 0:21:49,7
You just take the ends off the
rope, and then putting them on


755
0:21:49,7 --> 0:21:49,64
is just as easy.


756
0:21:49,64 --> 0:21:52,66
You just give them
a tie like that.


757
0:21:52,66 --> 0:21:53,97
And then they're on the rope.


758
0:21:53,97 --> 0:21:57,5
Now, remember, we started out
with three ropes, right?


759
0:21:57,5 --> 0:21:59,95
So there's one on my shoulder.


760
0:21:59,95 --> 0:22:2,8
The ends go in this hand,
the middle in this hand.


761
0:22:2,8 --> 0:22:4,99
Actually, if I take my fingers
like scissors, just like this,


762
0:22:4,99 --> 0:22:7,65
I can cut the rope into
two ropes like this.


763
0:22:7,65 --> 0:22:10,71
Now, two ropes of the exact
same size change into two


764
0:22:10,71 --> 0:22:13,51
ropes of different sizes, and
then back to one rope.


765
0:22:13,51 --> 0:22:14,85
I'll do that one more
time, except I want


766
0:22:14,85 --> 0:22:15,9
you to cut it, OK?


767
0:22:15,9 --> 0:22:17,78
Ends go in this hand, the middle
goes in this hand.


768
0:22:17,78 --> 0:22:18,86
Take your fingers
like scissors.


769
0:22:18,86 --> 0:22:19,13
STEVE SPANGLER: Like this?


770
0:22:19,13 --> 0:22:19,59
MAX DAVIDSON: Yeah, yeah.


771
0:22:19,59 --> 0:22:21,16
Just cut the rope-- perfect--
just like that--


772
0:22:21,16 --> 0:22:22,72
into two ropes.


773
0:22:22,72 --> 0:22:26,23
Now, what I'm going to to is
change them back to a short


774
0:22:26,23 --> 0:22:27,94
rope, a long rope, and
a medium rope.


775
0:22:27,94 --> 0:22:30,25
This is the short rope
and the long rope.


776
0:22:30,25 --> 0:22:30,895
I'm going to change--


777
0:22:30,895 --> 0:22:31,19
STEVE SPANGLER: This is
the short and long?


778
0:22:31,19 --> 0:22:32,5
MAX DAVIDSON: Yeah, yeah, but if
you blink, you'll miss it.


779
0:22:32,5 --> 0:22:34,24
So don't blink, but you actually
might have already


780
0:22:34,24 --> 0:22:35,83
because the knot isn't in
the middle anymore.


781
0:22:35,83 --> 0:22:39,73
It's actually on the end,
leaving us with a short rope--


782
0:22:39,73 --> 0:22:40,83
STEVE SPANGLER: Look
at this one.


783
0:22:40,83 --> 0:22:42,6
MAX DAVIDSON: --a long rope,
and a medium rope.


784
0:22:42,6 --> 0:22:44,7
STEVE SPANGLER: You
are amazing.


785
0:22:44,7 --> 0:22:46,3
You understand what a
little practice--


786
0:22:46,3 --> 0:22:50,31
the guy blows your mind,
and I'm right here.


787
0:22:50,31 --> 0:22:51,372
All right, cut.


788
0:22:51,372 --> 0:22:52,235
Show me how to do this.


789
0:22:52,235 --> 0:22:54,79
So if you want to try to stump
a magician, you grab them at


790
0:22:54,79 --> 0:22:56,6
the most inopportune time.


791
0:22:56,6 --> 0:22:56,995
You go, show me trick.


792
0:22:56,995 --> 0:23:0,19
And so Chad Wonder, Nickelodeon
Entertainer the


793
0:23:0,19 --> 0:23:3,745
Year, is grabbing a coffee,
and I go, stop, show me a


794
0:23:3,745 --> 0:23:5,39
trick, and so, here
we are here.


795
0:23:5,39 --> 0:23:7,88
And if you can catch them this
way, you know they're good.


796
0:23:7,88 --> 0:23:8,26
All right.


797
0:23:8,26 --> 0:23:8,43
CHAD WONDER: OK.


798
0:23:8,43 --> 0:23:10,8
STEVE SPANGLER: Please,
Chad, show me a trick.


799
0:23:10,8 --> 0:23:11,945
CHAD WONDER: So check
out nickels.


800
0:23:11,945 --> 0:23:13,37
This is a trick about nickels.


801
0:23:13,37 --> 0:23:14,77
So just make sure we
got nickels there.


802
0:23:14,77 --> 0:23:15,51
STEVE SPANGLER: We do.


803
0:23:15,51 --> 0:23:16,67
We've got nickels.


804
0:23:16,67 --> 0:23:17,9
They look like they're
real nickels.


805
0:23:17,9 --> 0:23:18,94
CHAD WONDER: And then
check this out.


806
0:23:18,94 --> 0:23:19,91
That's the important part.


807
0:23:19,91 --> 0:23:23,22
That is the old cap that--


808
0:23:23,22 --> 0:23:24,69
[INTERPOSING VOICES]


809
0:23:24,69 --> 0:23:25,79
STEVE SPANGLER: It's
just a cap?


810
0:23:25,79 --> 0:23:28,743
CHAD WONDER: Well, it's
actually from a gun--


811
0:23:28,743 --> 0:23:30,85
this was the back of a gun--
anyway, long story.


812
0:23:30,85 --> 0:23:31,67
STEVE SPANGLER: I understand.


813
0:23:31,67 --> 0:23:32,76
CHAD WONDER: It fits
perfectly--


814
0:23:32,76 --> 0:23:33,772
hold on.


815
0:23:33,772 --> 0:23:35,57
STEVE SPANGLER: So
magicians tinker


816
0:23:35,57 --> 0:23:36,6
around with stuff, right?


817
0:23:36,6 --> 0:23:37,81
You're always looking for--


818
0:23:37,81 --> 0:23:38,82
CHAD WONDER: [INAUDIBLE]
like this.


819
0:23:38,82 --> 0:23:39,71
STEVE SPANGLER: Where would you
find a cap that goes over


820
0:23:39,71 --> 0:23:40,6
and it goes--


821
0:23:40,6 --> 0:23:42,92
CHAD WONDER: Well, my grandpa
was on a battleship, and these


822
0:23:42,92 --> 0:23:44,4
are the little things
that fell off.


823
0:23:44,4 --> 0:23:45,25
STEVE SPANGLER: Too
much information.


824
0:23:45,25 --> 0:23:46,32
CHAD WONDER: All right,
here we go.


825
0:23:46,32 --> 0:23:49,68
So we're going to do this, and
then you get that right over


826
0:23:49,68 --> 0:23:51,35
the nickels, and then this
is the part where


827
0:23:51,35 --> 0:23:52,38
everybody gets fooled.


828
0:23:52,38 --> 0:23:54,79
I make them disappear
just like that.


829
0:23:54,79 --> 0:23:55,8
See [INAUDIBLE] was--


830
0:23:55,8 --> 0:23:56,69
STEVE SPANGLER: I'm
going to tell you,


831
0:23:56,69 --> 0:23:57,7
I saw you do something.


832
0:23:57,7 --> 0:24:0,416
I saw you kind of slip something
in underneath.


833
0:24:0,416 --> 0:24:2,32
CHAD WONDER: Uh--


834
0:24:2,32 --> 0:24:3,4
STEVE SPANGLER: I mean,
I'm not trying to--


835
0:24:3,4 --> 0:24:4,45
CHAD WONDER: But look--
they're gone.


836
0:24:4,45 --> 0:24:7,0
STEVE SPANGLER: OK, I know
they're gone, but I saw you


837
0:24:7,0 --> 0:24:8,15
shoot something under
your hand.


838
0:24:8,15 --> 0:24:10,6
I mean, I'm not trying to be a
jerk about it, but I saw you


839
0:24:10,6 --> 0:24:11,825
put something under your hand.


840
0:24:11,825 --> 0:24:15,98
CHAD WONDER: Steve, you're
supposed to be helping me out.


841
0:24:15,98 --> 0:24:17,62
STEVE SPANGLER: It doesn't
have to make the cut.


842
0:24:17,62 --> 0:24:18,73
I mean, if you don't
want to do it--


843
0:24:18,73 --> 0:24:20,92
CHAD WONDER: All right, well,
I turned them into dimes.


844
0:24:20,92 --> 0:24:21,8
STEVE SPANGLER: [CHUCKLING]


845
0:24:21,8 --> 0:24:22,73
CHAD WONDER: But,
wait, hold on.


846
0:24:22,73 --> 0:24:24,45
Here's the thing-- the nickels
are still here.


847
0:24:24,45 --> 0:24:26,6
You just have to-- they're
really big


848
0:24:26,6 --> 0:24:26,68
and jammed in there.


849
0:24:26,68 --> 0:24:26,96
Check it out.


850
0:24:26,96 --> 0:24:28,1
Look in there really hard, OK?


851
0:24:28,1 --> 0:24:28,72
STEVE SPANGLER: Look at this.


852
0:24:28,72 --> 0:24:30,58
They are not big in there, and
they're not jammed in there.


853
0:24:30,58 --> 0:24:31,18
CHAD WONDER: Look, I'll
show you why.


854
0:24:31,18 --> 0:24:32,494
I'll shake them out for you.


855
0:24:32,494 --> 0:24:32,932
There you go.


856
0:24:32,932 --> 0:24:33,9
See, it's right there.


857
0:24:33,9 --> 0:24:36,23
STEVE SPANGLER: Why do I think
I fell for this one hook,


858
0:24:36,23 --> 0:24:38,7
line, and sinker?


859
0:24:38,7 --> 0:24:39,244
Now I'm going to get a coffee.


860
0:24:39,244 --> 0:24:41,514
CHAD WONDER: I'll get
one with you.


861
0:24:41,514 --> 0:24:43,58
STEVE SPANGLER: John T. Sheets
is an amazing magician that


862
0:24:43,58 --> 0:24:46,12
does a stage act with doves
that appear everywhere.


863
0:24:46,12 --> 0:24:48,345
But you also are a master of
closeup magic, as well.


864
0:24:48,345 --> 0:24:50,25
And I stopped you and said, show
me something, and you've


865
0:24:50,25 --> 0:24:51,125
got something with quarters.


866
0:24:51,125 --> 0:24:51,99
JOHN T. SHEETS: I do.


867
0:24:51,99 --> 0:24:53,16
I've got a couple
quarters here.


868
0:24:53,16 --> 0:24:55,98
And if you will, take one,
and it's a free choice.


869
0:24:55,98 --> 0:24:57,11
That is a regular coin.


870
0:24:57,11 --> 0:25:0,38
Now, we could use your coin or
mine, but we'll just use this.


871
0:25:0,38 --> 0:25:1,58
If you will, take the pen.


872
0:25:1,58 --> 0:25:2,64
STEVE SPANGLER: I'm telling
you it's real.


873
0:25:2,64 --> 0:25:4,32
JOHN T. SHEETS: It
is a real coin.


874
0:25:4,32 --> 0:25:6,54
So take that and write your
initials on the coin.


875
0:25:6,54 --> 0:25:8,38
Now, you can write it
on one side or both.


876
0:25:8,38 --> 0:25:10,36
It's totally up to you.


877
0:25:10,36 --> 0:25:12,79
Now, what you've done is you've
identified it, so


878
0:25:12,79 --> 0:25:15,5
there's no other coin in the
world that looks like that.


879
0:25:15,5 --> 0:25:16,14
I'll take the pen.


880
0:25:16,14 --> 0:25:17,54
Go ahead and show that around.


881
0:25:17,54 --> 0:25:19,48
Show it to these people.
show it to the camera.


882
0:25:19,48 --> 0:25:21,78
Now, there's no way I could have
made those marks on there


883
0:25:21,78 --> 0:25:23,1
before you got here, right?


884
0:25:23,1 --> 0:25:24,7
STEVE SPANGLER: Not at all.


885
0:25:24,7 --> 0:25:24,47
JOHN T. SHEETS: Perfect.


886
0:25:24,47 --> 0:25:25,83
I'll take the coin.


887
0:25:25,83 --> 0:25:27,22
Now, do you know what
a quarter's


888
0:25:27,22 --> 0:25:29,56
made out of by chance?


889
0:25:29,56 --> 0:25:30,99
STEVE SPANGLER: I don't know.


890
0:25:30,99 --> 0:25:33,48
There's maybe some zinc
in there, you think?


891
0:25:33,48 --> 0:25:34,55
JOHN T. SHEETS: Nickel
and copper.


892
0:25:34,55 --> 0:25:36,58

sorry, yeah.

Look, nothing else
in my hands--


898

just the coin.


899
0:25:43,3 --> 0:25:45,68
Steve, if you will, hold
out your hand, and your


900
0:25:45,68 --> 0:25:47,13
initials are there.

looks like this, but if

you watch--

0:25:56,97 --> 0:25:58,9
JOHN T. SHEETS: It's now bent.


906

same initials--

you, yes, it is.

amazing.

really bent.

have a lot of good luck.

How does he bend a quarter?

There's a theme of young
magicians here at this


919
0:26:26,7 --> 0:26:28,9
conference, and magicians
have big conferences.

us some cool card magic?

TOMMY WALKER: Absolutely.

ahead and memorize it.

it back in the deck.

0:26:55,72 --> 0:26:57,646
I'll mix up the cards.

just like that.

fancy work.

snap, your card comes all the


943
0:27:3,33 --> 0:27:4,886
way up to the top.

not my card.

I could lie.

not my card.

TOMMY WALKER: Could you
hold open your hand?

0:27:10,56 --> 0:27:12,54
All right, I'll put
your card there.

other hand.

that's not my card.

try it again.

It always works the
second time.

0:27:18,8 --> 0:27:18,44
Watch.

0:27:18,44 --> 0:27:19,1
I just snap.

0:27:19,1 --> 0:27:20,881
It comes all the way
up to the top.

0:27:20,881 --> 0:27:22,43
STEVE SPANGLER: No, that's--


959
0:27:22,43 --> 0:27:23,3
wait-- that was--


960
0:27:23,3 --> 0:27:25,711
TOMMY WALKER: Take a
look in your hand.


961
0:27:25,711 --> 0:27:27,99
STEVE SPANGLER: That's
my card.


962
0:27:27,99 --> 0:27:28,675
That's amazing.


963
0:27:28,675 --> 0:27:29,42
TOMMY WALKER: Thank you.


964
0:27:29,42 --> 0:27:31,17
STEVE SPANGLER: Wait-- that
happened in my hand.


965
0:27:31,17 --> 0:27:33,554
You put that card--


966
0:27:33,554 --> 0:27:36,19
do I have my wallet still?


967
0:27:36,19 --> 0:27:37,78
You know when you're at a
magic convention, these


968
0:27:37,78 --> 0:27:39,93
magicians take over
the entire hotel.


969
0:27:39,93 --> 0:27:42,307
You'll find them, well, you've
seen them in the bathroom, at


970
0:27:42,307 --> 0:27:45,15
the bar, the front lobby.


971
0:27:45,15 --> 0:27:48,86
Brian Daniel South not only is
a great magician, but he came


972
0:27:48,86 --> 0:27:51,26
up with this idea of teaching
teachers how to do magic in


973
0:27:51,26 --> 0:27:51,81
the classroom.


974
0:27:51,81 --> 0:27:54,5
So if you see a teacher that's
doing magic in the classroom,


975
0:27:54,5 --> 0:27:56,66
pretty good idea that they were
part of your Teach by


976
0:27:56,66 --> 0:27:57,41
Magic program.


977
0:27:57,41 --> 0:27:59,96
So I have to ask you, will you
teach me how to do a trick?


978
0:27:59,96 --> 0:28:0,625
BRIAN DANIEL SOUTH:
I'd love to.


979
0:28:0,625 --> 0:28:1,69
STEVE SPANGLER: Teach our
viewers how to do a trick.


980
0:28:1,69 --> 0:28:2,68
BRIAN DANIEL SOUTH: We're going
to do a real simple


981
0:28:2,68 --> 0:28:3,64
trick with a rope.


982
0:28:3,64 --> 0:28:5,62
And it's not even a trick
so much as it is


983
0:28:5,62 --> 0:28:7,13
kind of a circus stunt.


984
0:28:7,13 --> 0:28:10,15
The idea is that I'm going to
tie a knot in a piece of rope


985
0:28:10,15 --> 0:28:12,0
just by waving it
just like that.


986
0:28:12,0 --> 0:28:13,31
See, that'd be pretty
good, right?


987
0:28:13,31 --> 0:28:14,34
STEVE SPANGLER: That'd be
awesome if you could do that.


988
0:28:14,34 --> 0:28:14,92
BRIAN DANIEL SOUTH: So
if I just do that.


989
0:28:14,92 --> 0:28:16,2
STEVE SPANGLER: [INAUDIBLE]
been working one hand.


990
0:28:16,2 --> 0:28:16,94
BRIAN DANIEL SOUTH: Just
one hand, yeah.


991
0:28:16,94 --> 0:28:18,59
You can even put one hand
behind your back.


992
0:28:18,59 --> 0:28:19,59
I've been practicing this one.


993
0:28:19,59 --> 0:28:22,3
It's kind of new, and that's the
idea is that we can learn


994
0:28:22,3 --> 0:28:24,51
simple little tricks like this,
but it doesn't always


995
0:28:24,51 --> 0:28:25,62
work the first time.


996
0:28:25,62 --> 0:28:27,81
And that's the idea you can
share with your students.


997
0:28:27,81 --> 0:28:31,4
Sometimes you have to practice
and you just wave it, ta-da!


998
0:28:31,4 --> 0:28:31,8
STEVE SPANGLER: Nice job.


999
0:28:31,8 --> 0:28:33,15
BRIAN DANIEL SOUTH: And then
you'll have the knot just like


1000
0:28:33,15 --> 0:28:35,38
that, so I like to use this one
with teachers because it


1001
0:28:35,38 --> 0:28:37,61
shows how simple magic can be.


1002
0:28:37,61 --> 0:28:39,84
It might look like it took a lot
of practice, and a lot of


1003
0:28:39,84 --> 0:28:42,16
hard work, and I've been
studying for years how to wave


1004
0:28:42,16 --> 0:28:45,49
a rope to make a knot, but the
simple secret was I had it in


1005
0:28:45,49 --> 0:28:47,291
my hand the whole time.


1006
0:28:47,291 --> 0:28:48,24
STEVE SPANGLER: So that's it?


1007
0:28:48,24 --> 0:28:50,63
So all you're doing is holding
it, but all the time, I never


1008
0:28:50,63 --> 0:28:53,48
once questioned what you
were doing, so I'm


1009
0:28:53,48 --> 0:28:53,92
just doing this thing.


1010
0:28:53,92 --> 0:28:55,7
BRIAN DANIEL SOUTH: I have
a rope with no knots.


1011
0:28:55,7 --> 0:28:56,25
I had a rope.


1012
0:28:56,25 --> 0:28:57,64
STEVE SPANGLER: So what if a
kid's, like, doing this to you


1013
0:28:57,64 --> 0:28:57,84
all the time?


1014
0:28:57,84 --> 0:28:58,75
BRIAN DANIEL SOUTH: Yeah,
that makes it more fun.


1015
0:28:58,75 --> 0:28:59,78
STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah,
that's more fun.


1016
0:28:59,78 --> 0:29:0,26
BRIAN DANIEL SOUTH: It's
more interactive.


1017
0:29:0,26 --> 0:29:2,0
STEVE SPANGLER: But you grab it
like that, and then all the


1018
0:29:2,0 --> 0:29:3,665
sudden, ta-da, but you have to
use your kind of flourish.


1019
0:29:3,665 --> 0:29:5,37
BRIAN DANIEL SOUTH: Yeah, you
got to, you know, build it up.


1020
0:29:5,37 --> 0:29:6,8
That's what magic's all
about-- the show.


1021
0:29:6,8 --> 0:29:7,76
STEVE SPANGLER: Because if you
just do that, then everybody


1022
0:29:7,76 --> 0:29:7,91
catches it.


1023
0:29:7,91 --> 0:29:9,71
BRIAN DANIEL SOUTH: If I just
said, here, have a rope, and


1024
0:29:9,71 --> 0:29:11,51
there's a knot, that's not
going to fool anyone.


1025
0:29:11,51 --> 0:29:12,38
STEVE SPANGLER: But if you
could really do it with


1026
0:29:12,38 --> 0:29:13,4
sleight of hand,
that would be--


1027
0:29:13,4 --> 0:29:15,39
I mean, can a real magician
actually-- is there a weight


1028
0:29:15,39 --> 0:29:15,84
in the [INAUDIBLE]--


1029
0:29:15,84 --> 0:29:16,51
BRIAN DANIEL SOUTH: That
would be [INAUDIBLE]--


1030
0:29:16,51 --> 0:29:16,855
STEVE SPANGLER: --with
manipulation?


1031
0:29:16,855 --> 0:29:17,56
BRIAN DANIEL SOUTH:
Well, let's see.


1032
0:29:17,56 --> 0:29:18,83
Let's try it out here.


1033
0:29:18,83 --> 0:29:20,3
We're going to take
out the knot.

0:29:20,42 --> 0:29:21,53

let me see.

1037
0:29:21,82 --> 0:29:23,24
BRIAN DANIEL SOUTH: Oh, yeah,
he's got [INAUDIBLE] sneaky.


1038
0:29:23,24 --> 0:29:23,71
STEVE SPANGLER: All right.


1039
0:29:23,71 --> 0:29:24,68
There is no knot.


1040
0:29:24,68 --> 0:29:25,41
BRIAN DANIEL SOUTH: No knot.


1041
0:29:25,41 --> 0:29:26,53
STEVE SPANGLER: I promise,
there's no knot.


1042
0:29:26,53 --> 0:29:28,16
BRIAN DANIEL SOUTH: All right,
so we're going to do the never


1043
0:29:28,16 --> 0:29:29,29

1044
0:29:29,29 --> 0:29:30,3
Here we go.


1045
0:29:30,3 --> 0:29:31,1
No knot.


1046
0:29:31,1 --> 0:29:33,69
Watch.


1047
0:29:33,69 --> 0:29:34,953
Just like that.


1048
0:29:34,953 --> 0:29:36,22
STEVE SPANGLER: (WHISPERING)
Bam!


1049
0:29:36,22 --> 0:29:37,34
See what happens when
you practice?


1050
0:29:37,34 --> 0:29:40,2
You get to be that good.


1051
0:29:40,2 --> 0:29:41,99
So this is what's so great about
Magic in the Rockies.

STEVE SPANGLER: No, I haven't.

supposed to-- get the camera

STEVE SPANGLER: The microphone's
back here, if you


1070
0:30:11,496 --> 0:30:12,5
want me to switch sides.


1071
0:30:12,5 --> 0:30:15,47

keys over here.


1072
0:30:15,47 --> 0:30:17,82
That way, again, I don't have to
cross over in front of you.


1073
0:30:17,82 --> 0:30:18,62
STEVE SPANGLER: OK, so where
do you want the keys?


1074
0:30:18,62 --> 0:30:20,435
GENE TURNER: Just put them in
this pocket right here.


1075
0:30:20,435 --> 0:30:21,865
STEVE SPANGLER: So
hold on a second.


1076
0:30:21,865 --> 0:30:23,57
I have to find where keys are.
