Don't get too leaned out to

We got cats who like to do the
syrup and jam they screw.

0:32:20,18 --> 0:32:21,1
But we got--

0:32:21,1 --> 0:32:25,2
today we had cats like KB,
from Street Military.

0:32:25,2 --> 0:32:27,35

And then the Screwed Up Clique
had a different style.


816
0:32:30,78 --> 0:32:34,14
So it's not all just based on
this one, everything's slow


817
0:32:34,14 --> 0:32:35,98
and you've got to be syruped
out to listen.
