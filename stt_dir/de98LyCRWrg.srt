[MUSIC PLAYING]


3
0:0:1,61 --> 0:0:2,71
STEVE SPANGLER: Well,
April Fools is


4
0:0:2,71 --> 0:0:3,47
right around the corner.


5
0:0:3,47 --> 0:0:6,14
That's why we dedicated
this entire episode


6
0:0:6,14 --> 0:0:8,39
to April Fools pranks.


7
0:0:8,39 --> 0:0:10,49
Now, there's lots of different
pranks on the internet, and


8
0:0:10,49 --> 0:0:15,37
hopefully these are smart,
clever, responsible pranks.


9
0:0:15,37 --> 0:0:17,23
I think you're going to enjoy
them, especially the thing


10
0:0:17,23 --> 0:0:18,53
with the Starbucks cup.


11
0:0:18,53 --> 0:0:23,29
So I want you to watch the
entire video, and if you want


12
0:0:23,29 --> 0:0:25,92
to do any of these, then post
them as response videos.


13
0:0:25,92 --> 0:0:27,93
Because we'd like to feature
some of your videos here on


14
0:0:27,93 --> 0:0:30,975
the channel, and we'll
send some prizes.


15
0:0:30,975 --> 0:0:33,161
Do we have money
for surprises?


16
0:0:33,161 --> 0:0:34,93
All right.


17
0:0:34,93 --> 0:0:35,65
Yeah, we'll send some prizes.


18
0:0:35,65 --> 0:0:36,55
We'll pick a couple of them.


19
0:0:36,55 --> 0:0:37,66
Why not?


20
0:0:37,66 --> 0:0:39,47
Happy April Fools!


21
0:0:39,47 --> 0:0:41,975
Don't get in trouble.


22
0:0:41,975 --> 0:0:43,12
Here's the deal.


23
0:0:43,12 --> 0:0:47,25
If you can turn lunch into a
science department, that's a


24
0:0:47,25 --> 0:0:47,71
good thing.


25
0:0:47,71 --> 0:0:49,646
Because you don't have to be
in a stuffy laboratory or


26
0:0:49,646 --> 0:0:50,79
anything like that.


27
0:0:50,79 --> 0:0:51,61
This is Sarah.


28
0:0:51,61 --> 0:0:54,33
She has been nice enough to hang
with me today, because


29
0:0:54,33 --> 0:0:56,89
we're going to get ready
for April Fools.


30
0:0:56,89 --> 0:0:59,5
And not you could have to just
do pranks on April Fools.


31
0:0:59,5 --> 0:1:2,53
This is just a reminder that
it's a good time to do pranks.


32
0:1:2,53 --> 0:1:4,959
And you could do some pretty
clever pranks.


33
0:1:4,959 --> 0:1:7,39
That said, this is the part of
the program where I say don't


34
0:1:7,39 --> 0:1:8,7
try this at home.


35
0:1:8,7 --> 0:1:10,414
This is all stuff you can try at
home, I'm just going to ask


36
0:1:10,414 --> 0:1:11,61
you to be responsible.


37
0:1:11,61 --> 0:1:13,61
Because I'm going to show you
how to do some things--


38
0:1:13,61 --> 0:1:15,26
you just have to be in control
of it, so neither


39
0:1:15,26 --> 0:1:16,22
of us get in trouble.


40
0:1:16,22 --> 0:1:17,216
Fair enough?


41
0:1:17,216 --> 0:1:18,71
All right.


42
0:1:18,71 --> 0:1:19,74
Let me dig back a little bit.


43
0:1:19,74 --> 0:1:23,18
Do you remember a
couple episodes


44
0:1:23,18 --> 0:1:25,5
back, we used a polymer.


45
0:1:25,5 --> 0:1:26,92
So I'm going to show you the
behind-the-scenes first, and


46
0:1:26,92 --> 0:1:28,206
then we're going
to prepare it.


47
0:1:28,206 --> 0:1:29,17
And we'll go play the prank
on somebody else.


48
0:1:29,17 --> 0:1:29,36
SARAH: All right.


49
0:1:29,36 --> 0:1:29,99
STEVE SPANGLER: Fair enough?


50
0:1:29,99 --> 0:1:32,93
So a couple episodes back,
we used a diaper.


51
0:1:32,93 --> 0:1:34,95
So we just took a baby
diaper, cut it open,


52
0:1:34,95 --> 0:1:35,66
and dumped it out.


53
0:1:35,66 --> 0:1:36,91
And we got this super absorbent


54
0:1:36,91 --> 0:1:38,36
polymer out of the diaper.


55
0:1:38,36 --> 0:1:40,76
If you buy it from a science
company, it looks like this,


56
0:1:40,76 --> 0:1:43,89
or a jar of a material
called water gel--


57
0:1:43,89 --> 0:1:46,3
actual chemical name is
sodium polyacrylate.


58
0:1:46,3 --> 0:1:48,18
It's just a super absorbent
polymer.


59
0:1:48,18 --> 0:1:51,79
So if you haven't seen it
before, so it's not a complete


60
0:1:51,79 --> 0:1:53,54
surprise to you, watch this.


61
0:1:53,54 --> 0:1:56,79
I'm just going to take some of
the powder and put some of the


62
0:1:56,79 --> 0:1:58,48
polymer in the cup like this.


63
0:1:58,48 --> 0:1:58,87
All right?


64
0:1:58,87 --> 0:2:2,26
It looks a lot like Sweet'N
Low or NutraSweet.


65
0:2:2,26 --> 0:2:4,2
I mean, there's a lot of Sweet'N
Low or NutraSweet, but


66
0:2:4,2 --> 0:2:5,79
again, that's kind of
what it looks like.


67
0:2:5,79 --> 0:2:8,439
OK, now here, you go ahead
and pour the water in.


68
0:2:8,439 --> 0:2:8,759
Ready?


69
0:2:8,759 --> 0:2:10,11
Pour the water in, quickly.


70
0:2:10,11 --> 0:2:10,5
Keep going.


71
0:2:10,5 --> 0:2:11,44
Keep going.


72
0:2:11,44 --> 0:2:15,38
That's it, and now turn the
whole thing upside down.


73
0:2:15,38 --> 0:2:16,34
Isn't that awesome?


74
0:2:16,34 --> 0:2:16,82
SARAH: It's cool.


75
0:2:16,82 --> 0:2:17,3
STEVE SPANGLER: OK.


76
0:2:17,3 --> 0:2:21,12
So, this is the super absorbent
material, and


77
0:2:21,12 --> 0:2:23,89
there's lots of things to be
able to do with the polymer.


78
0:2:23,89 --> 0:2:25,97
But people don't expect
that to happen.


79
0:2:25,97 --> 0:2:28,23
And because it looks like
Splenda, or NutraSweet, or


80
0:2:28,23 --> 0:2:32,9
Sweet'N Low the thought is what
if we took these packets


81
0:2:32,9 --> 0:2:35,46
here, actually dumped the
contents out that you would


82
0:2:35,46 --> 0:2:37,5
normally eat, put the polymer
back inside--


83
0:2:37,5 --> 0:2:39,86
I'll show you how
to seal it up.


84
0:2:39,86 --> 0:2:42,84
Now this is pretty good, because
then somebody has no


85
0:2:42,84 --> 0:2:44,13
suspicion whatsoever.


86
0:2:44,13 --> 0:2:45,99
And I actually have made
some here, so here,


87
0:2:45,99 --> 0:2:47,13
take a look at this.


88
0:2:47,13 --> 0:2:49,83
These are my prepared packets
that I did already.


89
0:2:49,83 --> 0:2:52,1
So I just gotta hide
these, right?


90
0:2:52,1 --> 0:2:53,42
So look at this.


91
0:2:53,42 --> 0:2:54,71
I don't want to mix
the two up.


92
0:2:54,71 --> 0:2:57,96
You really cannot tell that
they've been prepared, and


93
0:2:57,96 --> 0:2:59,64
they have the polymer
that's inside.


94
0:2:59,64 --> 0:3:2,49
If you look very closely, you
can see some of the tape marks


95
0:3:2,49 --> 0:3:3,18
and so forth.


96
0:3:3,18 --> 0:3:5,61
These have not been prepared,
these have been prepared.


97
0:3:5,61 --> 0:3:6,87
And it looks really,
really good.


98
0:3:6,87 --> 0:3:7,32
Right?


99
0:3:7,32 --> 0:3:8,415
All right, so here's
everything that


100
0:3:8,415 --> 0:3:9,3
you're going to need.


101
0:3:9,3 --> 0:3:11,68
I just went and got some of the
Splenda packets and some


102
0:3:11,68 --> 0:3:14,3
of these Sweet'N Low-- it's
perfect, all right?


103
0:3:14,3 --> 0:3:15,54
And so here's what
I'm going to do.


104
0:3:15,54 --> 0:3:16,57
You do yours, Sarah,
like this.


105
0:3:16,57 --> 0:3:18,22
What you do is you're
just going to shake


106
0:3:18,22 --> 0:3:19,3
it down like this.


107
0:3:19,3 --> 0:3:22,13
So you want to shake the actual
Sweet'N Low down all


108
0:3:22,13 --> 0:3:23,91
the way to the bottom
like this.


109
0:3:23,91 --> 0:3:26,38
And then, this one here
has this line that's


110
0:3:26,38 --> 0:3:27,66
perfectly cut on it.


111
0:3:27,66 --> 0:3:29,63
See that little line that goes
across here like that?


112
0:3:29,63 --> 0:3:30,38
SARAH: Yeah.


113
0:3:30,38 --> 0:3:32,24
STEVE SPANGLER: All right, so
now I'm just going to take the


114
0:3:32,24 --> 0:3:34,42
X-acto Knife for that little
sharp piece there, and I'm


115
0:3:34,42 --> 0:3:36,73
just going to cut into
it like this.


116
0:3:36,73 --> 0:3:39,28
And because I put the polymer
down there like that, it's


117
0:3:39,28 --> 0:3:41,28
going to be easy for
me to take it out.


118
0:3:41,28 --> 0:3:41,717
OK?


119
0:3:41,717 --> 0:3:42,591
Try yours.


120
0:3:42,591 --> 0:3:43,3
SARAH: All right.


121
0:3:43,3 --> 0:3:44,3
STEVE SPANGLER: And see
what it looks like.


122
0:3:44,3 --> 0:3:44,295
Good?


123
0:3:44,295 --> 0:3:44,56
SARAH: All right.


124
0:3:44,56 --> 0:3:45,16
STEVE SPANGLER: All right.


125
0:3:45,16 --> 0:3:48,32
So now, just in an empty cup,
just got to dump this out.


126
0:3:48,32 --> 0:3:52,28
So this is the actual
sweetener-- right, the


127
0:3:52,28 --> 0:3:53,2
artificial sweetener.


128
0:3:53,2 --> 0:3:54,85
So dump that out.


129
0:3:54,85 --> 0:3:55,31
Good.


130
0:3:55,31 --> 0:4:0,44
And now we have a packet that's
perfect, right there.


131
0:4:0,44 --> 0:4:2,94
So now this is going to be
perfect for us to dump the


132
0:4:2,94 --> 0:4:4,62
polymer back into.


133
0:4:4,62 --> 0:4:4,504
All right?


134
0:4:4,504 --> 0:4:6,95
Now let's fill this one up.


135
0:4:6,95 --> 0:4:6,91
OK, ready?


136
0:4:6,91 --> 0:4:8,1
Here's yours.


137
0:4:8,1 --> 0:4:9,4
Good.


138
0:4:9,4 --> 0:4:11,2
And so this goes in.


139
0:4:11,2 --> 0:4:12,2
This is perfect.


140
0:4:12,2 --> 0:4:13,92
Now we just have to seal
this back up again.


141
0:4:13,92 --> 0:4:17,63
And I'll just get a piece of
tape like this, pull it off,


142
0:4:17,63 --> 0:4:19,24
and put it across there.


143
0:4:19,24 --> 0:4:21,754
And it's that Scotch Tape
that kind of disappears.


144
0:4:21,754 --> 0:4:22,85
SARAH: Oh wow.


145
0:4:22,85 --> 0:4:24,1
STEVE SPANGLER: And couldn't
see it on the other ones.


146
0:4:24,1 --> 0:4:24,76
SARAH: No I couldn't.


147
0:4:24,76 --> 0:4:25,12
STEVE SPANGLER: Right?


148
0:4:25,12 --> 0:4:26,5
On all of them that
I set out there.


149
0:4:26,5 --> 0:4:29,47
Now these are the gimmick
packets that are over there.


150
0:4:29,47 --> 0:4:31,46
Let me clean this off.


151
0:4:31,46 --> 0:4:34,24
So that's the gimmick packet,
and these are the regular


152
0:4:34,24 --> 0:4:35,17
packets here.


153
0:4:35,17 --> 0:4:39,96
So when I do this to somebody,
I could it just mix these in,


154
0:4:39,96 --> 0:4:41,71
and I would suggest that
you don't put it


155
0:4:41,71 --> 0:4:43,5
in the sugar container.


156
0:4:43,5 --> 0:4:44,38
Because if you put it in
the sugar container,


157
0:4:44,38 --> 0:4:45,37
you're going to forget.


158
0:4:45,37 --> 0:4:47,21
Then you're going to waste
everything and you're going to


159
0:4:47,21 --> 0:4:48,51
think, well that's funny.


160
0:4:48,51 --> 0:4:50,37
But if it's not in your control,
it's not a funny


161
0:4:50,37 --> 0:4:51,25
prank, all right?


162
0:4:51,25 --> 0:4:52,42
You gotta take--


163
0:4:52,42 --> 0:4:53,24
So let me show you.


164
0:4:53,24 --> 0:4:53,93
Here's the move.


165
0:4:53,93 --> 0:4:55,48
Just hold it in your
fingers, like this,


166
0:4:55,48 --> 0:4:56,86
like a magician would.


167
0:4:56,86 --> 0:4:58,68
Just kind of clip it in your
fingers like this.


168
0:4:58,68 --> 0:4:59,12
SARAH: OK.


169
0:4:59,12 --> 0:4:59,56
STEVE SPANGLER: OK?


170
0:4:59,56 --> 0:5:1,27
And just kind of curl your
fingers around--


171
0:5:1,27 --> 0:5:3,4
yeah, like this.


172
0:5:3,4 --> 0:5:4,31
Now turn your hand over.


173
0:5:4,31 --> 0:5:5,565
Nobody really cares.


174
0:5:5,565 --> 0:5:6,786
See, look at you.


175
0:5:6,786 --> 0:5:7,84
See how you're trying
to cover it?


176
0:5:7,84 --> 0:5:9,71
No, you don't have to do that,
because if I really had my


177
0:5:9,71 --> 0:5:10,62
hands here, it'd be like this.


178
0:5:10,62 --> 0:5:12,75
Or if I was holding my drink--
so, here hold your drink.


179
0:5:12,75 --> 0:5:13,81
Nobody even suspects it.


180
0:5:13,81 --> 0:5:16,4
So if you want to show somebody,
you go like this.


181
0:5:16,4 --> 0:5:17,91
You go, oh, here look
at this you.


182
0:5:17,91 --> 0:5:20,56
And you just pick up a bunch
of them, and drop it on the


183
0:5:20,56 --> 0:5:21,895
very top, like that.


184
0:5:21,895 --> 0:5:23,76
Drop it on the top,
and then grab it.


185
0:5:23,76 --> 0:5:25,92
Yeah, that's it.


186
0:5:25,92 --> 0:5:26,6
Nobody really cares.


187
0:5:26,6 --> 0:5:27,84
You're just picking up one,
and you just reach


188
0:5:27,84 --> 0:5:28,41
in and pick it up.


189
0:5:28,41 --> 0:5:28,73
See?


190
0:5:28,73 --> 0:5:29,5
SARAH: Very cool.


191
0:5:29,5 --> 0:5:30,44
STEVE SPANGLER: Now, you're in
control of it the whole time,


192
0:5:30,44 --> 0:5:31,77
and we don't get in trouble.


193
0:5:31,77 --> 0:5:32,35
All right?


194
0:5:32,35 --> 0:5:34,105
So now shake it down
like this.


195
0:5:34,105 --> 0:5:35,515
Oh this is the best part.


196
0:5:35,515 --> 0:5:37,9
OK, so now here, try it.


197
0:5:37,9 --> 0:5:40,52
You just don't want
to do too much.


198
0:5:40,52 --> 0:5:41,42
And tear it open.


199
0:5:41,42 --> 0:5:41,805
SARAH: All right.


200
0:5:41,805 --> 0:5:42,59
STEVE SPANGLER: Good.


201
0:5:42,59 --> 0:5:43,71
And you do it to the waiter.


202
0:5:43,71 --> 0:5:45,83
So when the waiter comes over,
say I think there's really a


203
0:5:45,83 --> 0:5:47,9
problem with the sweetener.


204
0:5:47,9 --> 0:5:47,81
Here watch.


205
0:5:47,81 --> 0:5:49,83
Tear it open in front of
them, and dump it in.


206
0:5:49,83 --> 0:5:50,34
Good job.


207
0:5:50,34 --> 0:5:52,18
Put that off to the side.


208
0:5:52,18 --> 0:5:54,95
Yeah, and now you want to be
careful to get rid of that


209
0:5:54,95 --> 0:5:55,67
here in a second.


210
0:5:55,67 --> 0:5:57,56
So once they're playing with
this, and it's all gelled,


211
0:5:57,56 --> 0:5:59,222
you're going to get rid of that,
because they're going to


212
0:5:59,222 --> 0:6:1,22
want to go back to the packet.


213
0:6:1,22 --> 0:6:3,3
Or you could push
it on the floor.


214
0:6:3,3 --> 0:6:3,77
That's perfect.


215
0:6:3,77 --> 0:6:4,13
All right?


216
0:6:4,13 --> 0:6:6,69
So now, when you pour it in,
you gotta pour it kind of


217
0:6:6,69 --> 0:6:7,4
fast, ready?


218
0:6:7,4 --> 0:6:9,88
Because you don't want
it to all solidify


219
0:6:9,88 --> 0:6:10,65
there on the bottom.


220
0:6:10,65 --> 0:6:13,57
I love the fact that in pure
water, it absorbs about


221
0:6:13,57 --> 0:6:16,65
500-800 times it's weight in
water, but this-- it's a


222
0:6:16,65 --> 0:6:17,32
little bit longer.


223
0:6:17,32 --> 0:6:17,72
SARAH: I love it.


224
0:6:17,72 --> 0:6:18,28
STEVE SPANGLER: This is good.


225
0:6:18,28 --> 0:6:21,41
All right, but just be
responsible about the whole


226
0:6:21,41 --> 0:6:22,51
thing, and it'll
be just great.


227
0:6:22,51 --> 0:6:24,87
Because there's nothing better
than to shake it down, and


228
0:6:24,87 --> 0:6:27,41
stir your spoon, and it stands
straight up in the tea.


229
0:6:27,41 --> 0:6:27,75
Like look at that.


230
0:6:27,75 --> 0:6:29,4
That's awesome.


231
0:6:29,4 --> 0:6:31,95
Why isn't that great as a
great practical joke.


232
0:6:31,95 --> 0:6:32,48
SARAH: Oh my gosh.


233
0:6:32,48 --> 0:6:34,24
STEVE SPANGLER: But we have
people at the office, as you


234
0:6:34,24 --> 0:6:35,63
know, that don't use
the packets.


235
0:6:35,63 --> 0:6:37,5
What do they use
in the morning?


236
0:6:37,5 --> 0:6:38,53
SARAH: They use the
big can-- the jar.


237
0:6:38,53 --> 0:6:40,81
STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah, so our job
is going to be to go back


238
0:6:40,81 --> 0:6:41,85
and to substitute--


239
0:6:41,85 --> 0:6:45,26
even though they work with us,
and they work with us all the


240
0:6:45,26 --> 0:6:46,99
time, they package
it and so forth--


241
0:6:46,99 --> 0:6:47,985
they'll never guess.


242
0:6:47,985 --> 0:6:50,44
So we'll go dump it in, then
we'll take some of the GoPro


243
0:6:50,44 --> 0:6:51,39
cameras and we'll hide them.


244
0:6:51,39 --> 0:6:53,3
And let's just watch in the
morning what happens


245
0:6:53,3 --> 0:6:53,88
when they do their--


246
0:6:53,88 --> 0:6:55,648
and they'll never suspect it.


247
0:6:55,648 --> 0:6:56,532
SARAH: It's going to be great.


248
0:6:56,532 --> 0:6:57,42
STEVE SPANGLER: It's
going to be great.


249
0:6:57,42 --> 0:6:58,97
All right, so there's a couple
things that you need for this


250
0:6:58,97 --> 0:6:59,46
next prank.


251
0:6:59,46 --> 0:7:2,45
You're going to need a super
strong magnet-- a neodymium


252
0:7:2,45 --> 0:7:4,9
magnet and you're going to
need a ball bearing.


253
0:7:4,9 --> 0:7:6,16
And we're at a hardware store,
kind of an obscure little


254
0:7:6,16 --> 0:7:8,1
hardware store, this
will be perfect.


255
0:7:8,1 --> 0:7:9,35
OK?


256
0:7:9,35 --> 0:7:12,86



257
0:7:12,86 --> 0:7:15,76
So you're looking for not
just an ordinary magnet.


258
0:7:15,76 --> 0:7:16,755
This is a neodymium magnet.


259
0:7:16,755 --> 0:7:19,67
It's a super, super strong
rare earth magnet.


260
0:7:19,67 --> 0:7:20,635
Super strong--


261
0:7:20,635 --> 0:7:25,24
I mean it's really, really,
really strong.


262
0:7:25,24 --> 0:7:28,75
Neodymium is a permanent
earth magnet.


263
0:7:28,75 --> 0:7:29,37
Isn't that great?


264
0:7:29,37 --> 0:7:31,27
So we're going to need
that magnet.


265
0:7:31,27 --> 0:7:31,78
All right?


266
0:7:31,78 --> 0:7:32,88
So buy one.


267
0:7:32,88 --> 0:7:34,86
Don't just take it out
of the package.


268
0:7:34,86 --> 0:7:35,92
You bought it.


269
0:7:35,92 --> 0:7:37,12
SARAH: OK.


270
0:7:37,12 --> 0:7:38,37
STEVE SPANGLER: Now we
need a ball bearing.


271
0:7:38,37 --> 0:7:41,27



272
0:7:41,27 --> 0:7:45,12
When you're in these obscure,
tiny, little hardware stores,


273
0:7:45,12 --> 0:7:46,37
you can usually find anything.


274
0:7:46,37 --> 0:7:49,552



275
0:7:49,552 --> 0:7:51,8
That seems to be--


276
0:7:51,8 --> 0:7:53,68
that's probably perfect
size, OK?


277
0:7:53,68 --> 0:7:55,17
That's a ball bearing.


278
0:7:55,17 --> 0:7:57,97
Now why you need a
ball bearing--


279
0:7:57,97 --> 0:7:59,49
the normal person needs
a ball bearing--


280
0:7:59,49 --> 0:8:2,48
I have no idea, but that's the
ball bearing we need, OK?


281
0:8:2,48 --> 0:8:4,33
So now we're set up
for our joke.


282
0:8:4,33 --> 0:8:7,44
We have our neodymium magnet,
and we have our ball bearing.


283
0:8:7,44 --> 0:8:10,52
The last thing that we need is
a can of paint, all right?


284
0:8:10,52 --> 0:8:15,74
So not all cans of paint are the
same, so let me show you.


285
0:8:15,74 --> 0:8:17,36
All right, so we have everything
we need-- the


286
0:8:17,36 --> 0:8:21,27
neodymium magnet, we've got the
ball bearing, and now we


287
0:8:21,27 --> 0:8:22,52
need to have a can of paint.


288
0:8:22,52 --> 0:8:26,28
Now, a long time ago, they made
cans of paint that had


289
0:8:26,28 --> 0:8:28,592
metal ball bearings inside--


290
0:8:28,592 --> 0:8:31,11
that classic sound
that you here.


291
0:8:31,11 --> 0:8:33,65
A lot of them now are marbles,
so it's ceramic.


292
0:8:33,65 --> 0:8:35,14
So you would hope for them--


293
0:8:35,14 --> 0:8:36,95
so you might have to
play into your own.


294
0:8:36,95 --> 0:8:37,58
OK?


295
0:8:37,58 --> 0:8:39,39
So here's what I
want you to do.


296
0:8:39,39 --> 0:8:42,89
I want you to hold the magnet
in this hand, like this.


297
0:8:42,89 --> 0:8:43,809
Got it?


298
0:8:43,809 --> 0:8:44,705
You're going to hold
the ball bearing in


299
0:8:44,705 --> 0:8:45,52
this hand, like this.


300
0:8:45,52 --> 0:8:46,72
And just--


301
0:8:46,72 --> 0:8:48,2
nobody will care, OK?


302
0:8:48,2 --> 0:8:49,68
Because we've got a can
of paint in our hand.


303
0:8:49,68 --> 0:8:53,6
So hopefully, the guy
is going to find you


304
0:8:53,6 --> 0:8:53,71
that's in the aisle.


305
0:8:53,71 --> 0:8:56,847
So when you're walking the
aisle, you want to make sure


306
0:8:56,847 --> 0:8:58,22
you're just making some noise.


307
0:8:58,22 --> 0:9:0,69
Somebody will inevitably come
over and say, may I help you?


308
0:9:0,69 --> 0:9:1,0
All right?


309
0:9:1,0 --> 0:9:1,682
So that's where you pick it up.


310
0:9:1,682 --> 0:9:1,98
Ready?


311
0:9:1,98 --> 0:9:3,12
So you're going like this--


312
0:9:3,12 --> 0:9:3,55
shake.


313
0:9:3,55 --> 0:9:7,375
And as you shake it like this,
if you put his hand on there,


314
0:9:7,375 --> 0:9:9,21
the ball bearing will stick.


315
0:9:9,21 --> 0:9:9,53
Ready?


316
0:9:9,53 --> 0:9:10,88
So shake like this,
see how it sticks?


317
0:9:10,88 --> 0:9:13,1
As soon as they hear that stick,
this hand comes up at


318
0:9:13,1 --> 0:9:14,4
the same time.


319
0:9:14,4 --> 0:9:15,51
So it looks like this.


320
0:9:15,51 --> 0:9:17,196
Oopsie.


321
0:9:17,196 --> 0:9:18,8
Isn't that great?


322
0:9:18,8 --> 0:9:21,4
And so that little dink dink
is great, because now when


323
0:9:21,4 --> 0:9:23,81
they look back up at ya,
you're doing this.


324
0:9:23,81 --> 0:9:25,285
And as long as your hand
is covering the


325
0:9:25,285 --> 0:9:26,68
magnet, it's great.


326
0:9:26,68 --> 0:9:27,51
Isn't that perfect?


327
0:9:27,51 --> 0:9:29,63
And now you reach down, and
you pick it up like this.


328
0:9:29,63 --> 0:9:33,4
You say lucky for you,
I can put it back.


329
0:9:33,4 --> 0:9:35,83
All I'm doing is just smashing
it like this, and pulling this


330
0:9:35,83 --> 0:9:36,66
off at the same time.


331
0:9:36,66 --> 0:9:40,44
So I'm just doing this-- like
this-- and then shaking.


332
0:9:40,44 --> 0:9:42,45
And now you know the paint
trick, all right?


333
0:9:42,45 --> 0:9:44,74
There's a lot of uses for
neodymium magnets, but this is


334
0:9:44,74 --> 0:9:47,11
probably the best one if you
have nothing to do on a


335
0:9:47,11 --> 0:9:49,56
Saturday afternoon and you want
to go to hardware store.


336
0:9:49,56 --> 0:9:51,49
It's just hours of fun at
the hardware store.

0:9:52,91 --> 0:9:54,29
STEVE SPANGLER: OK.

0:9:54,29 --> 0:9:55,69
So here's what's great.


341
0:9:55,69 --> 0:9:58,1
It's just right around the
corner, so Sarah and I are


342
0:9:58,1 --> 0:10:1,91
just going to stand there and
ask questions about paint, OK?

here's another prank you can


354
0:10:48,14 --> 0:10:51,98
do since you already have the
neodymium magnet, try this.


355
0:10:51,98 --> 0:10:53,35
So what did I ask
you to just do?


356
0:10:53,35 --> 0:10:55,38
We pulled up, what did
you have to do?


357

SARAH: I got you an empty
cup and a lid.


358

STEVE SPANGLER: So she walks
into Starbucks, and she just


359
0:10:59,71 --> 0:11:1,8
asked may I please have
an empty cup?


360

why or anything?

0:11:5,13 --> 0:11:6,4
So now, here's what do.


366

You take the neodymium

368
0:11:9,69 --> 0:11:10,94
See how it's here in the cup?


369
0:11:10,94 --> 0:11:11,94
And then--


370
0:11:11,94 --> 0:11:14,49
so see, it just rests in
the bottom, no liquid--


371
0:11:14,49 --> 0:11:16,23
and now you just put
this on top.

a real drink.

0:11:18,232 --> 0:11:18,63
OK?

is so strong, watch this.
