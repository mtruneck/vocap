1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:1,25



2
0:0:1,25 --> 0:0:7,22



3
0:0:7,22 --> 0:0:8,63
SHANE SMITH: Last time we
talked to you, Mr. Ben


4
0:0:8,63 --> 0:0:13,74
Anderson, you had just come back
from doing a documentary


5
0:0:13,74 --> 0:0:17,65
on Afghanistan, following the
British troops there.


6
0:0:17,65 --> 0:0:20,18
And it was a bit of a cock-up.


7
0:0:20,18 --> 0:0:21,44
BEN ANDERSON: Yeah.


8
0:0:21,44 --> 0:0:23,91
SHANE SMITH: And now you just
got back from Dubai.


9
0:0:23,91 --> 0:0:24,78
BEN ANDERSON: Yep.


10
0:0:24,78 --> 0:0:26,82
SHANE SMITH: Now most people
know about Dubai because


11
0:0:26,82 --> 0:0:29,34
they're trying to be the
hub of the Middle East.


12
0:0:29,34 --> 0:0:32,33
And you went and found
out some stuff about?


13
0:0:32,33 --> 0:0:34,2
BEN ANDERSON: The guys actually
building the big,


14
0:0:34,2 --> 0:0:36,43
shiny skyscrapers and the
world's biggest mall and the


15
0:0:36,43 --> 0:0:38,47
world's biggest aquarium
and all that stuff.


16
0:0:38,47 --> 0:0:41,28
The guys who are being paid
almost nothing to build it.


17
0:0:41,28 --> 0:0:45,72
SHANE SMITH: So they're
being built by slaves.


18
0:0:45,72 --> 0:0:46,545
BEN ANDERSON: That's not
an exaggeration.


19
0:0:46,545 --> 0:0:47,1
Yeah.


20
0:0:47,1 --> 0:0:48,15
SHANE SMITH: Really.


21
0:0:48,15 --> 0:0:49,67
BEN ANDERSON: Once they find
themselves out there, and they


22
0:0:49,67 --> 0:0:51,37
realize how much they're getting
paid or how much


23
0:0:51,37 --> 0:0:53,72
they're not getting paid,
they're indebted by the time


24
0:0:53,72 --> 0:0:54,18
they arrive there.


25
0:0:54,18 --> 0:0:55,43
So it is bonded labor.


26
0:0:55,43 --> 0:1:8,36



27
0:1:8,36 --> 0:1:10,64
We focused on the Bangladeshi
workers.


28
0:1:10,64 --> 0:1:12,42
The local agents approach
them in their villages.


29
0:1:12,42 --> 0:1:14,34
Say, you've heard about
Dubai, you've heard


30
0:1:14,34 --> 0:1:14,53
how amazing it is.


31
0:1:14,53 --> 0:1:16,93
I can get you a job out there
where you get paid


32
0:1:16,93 --> 0:1:18,12
300 pounds a month.


33
0:1:18,12 --> 0:1:20,2
Which to them is an
amazing salary.


34
0:1:20,2 --> 0:1:24,11
Pay me 2,000 pounds, 200,000
taka, local money, I'll get


35
0:1:24,11 --> 0:1:24,71
you out there.


36
0:1:24,71 --> 0:1:26,26
It'll take you six months,
a year, to pay


37
0:1:26,26 --> 0:1:27,92
off the 2,000 pounds.


38
0:1:27,92 --> 0:1:29,561
Then you'll start sending
loads of money home.


39
0:1:29,561 --> 0:1:32,44
And before you know it, you'll
be buying your family a shop


40
0:1:32,44 --> 0:1:34,57
or a farm or whatever it is.


41
0:1:34,57 --> 0:1:37,31
As soon as they land, their
passports are taken away.


42
0:1:37,31 --> 0:1:39,82
They also then find out they're
getting paid between


43
0:1:39,82 --> 0:1:42,78
120 and 160 pounds a month.


44
0:1:42,78 --> 0:1:46,8
And this is for six days a
week, 12 hours a day, and


45
0:1:46,8 --> 0:1:49,79
living eight men to a room and
in what we saw were absolutely


46
0:1:49,79 --> 0:1:51,6
squalid conditions.


47
0:1:51,6 --> 0:1:54,18
The dream of escaping the dreary
British winters and


48
0:1:54,18 --> 0:1:57,54
joining the celebs in the sun
is one many Brits share.


49
0:1:57,54 --> 0:2:0,465
So I pretended to be one of them
and signed up for a First


50
0:2:0,465 --> 0:2:3,326
Group tour that they promised
would show me a side of Dubai


51
0:2:3,326 --> 0:2:5,806
which simply can't be revealed
from a web site


52
0:2:5,806 --> 0:2:8,289
or newspaper article.


53
0:2:8,289 --> 0:2:10,55
The First Group sales team are
adamant the workers building


54
0:2:10,55 --> 0:2:12,547
their project were
treated well.


55
0:2:12,547 --> 0:2:32,63



56
0:2:32,63 --> 0:2:33,75
SHANE SMITH: This is what I
found interesting about this


57
0:2:33,75 --> 0:2:37,44
is, this is a common perception,
even when I was


58
0:2:37,44 --> 0:2:40,54
there in Dubai, is that,
oh, it's good for them.


59
0:2:40,54 --> 0:2:40,943
BEN ANDERSON: Yeah.


60
0:2:40,943 --> 0:2:41,75
Looks bad to us, but--


61
0:2:41,75 --> 0:2:43,685
SHANE SMITH: Yeah, it looks
bad to us but, yeah,


62
0:2:43,685 --> 0:2:45,5
it's good for them.


63
0:2:45,5 --> 0:2:46,33
BEN ANDERSON: We can't
get onsite to


64
0:2:46,33 --> 0:2:47,841
interview the workers.


65
0:2:47,841 --> 0:2:49,98
We're going to wait until they
knock off, follow them back to


66
0:2:49,98 --> 0:2:53,26
their labor camp and see what
conditions are like on this,


67
0:2:53,26 --> 0:2:55,68
which is one of the most
high-profile projects in the


68
0:2:55,68 --> 0:2:57,84
whole of Dubai.


69
0:2:57,84 --> 0:2:59,9



70
0:2:59,9 --> 0:3:2,73
This is pretty much how we
worked for over a period of


71
0:3:2,73 --> 0:3:3,68
three months out there.


72
0:3:3,68 --> 0:3:6,49
Sneak in or speak to them before
they went into the


73
0:3:6,49 --> 0:3:6,87
labor camp.


74
0:3:6,87 --> 0:3:9,43
Because there's a camp boss at
every single gate, stopping


75
0:3:9,43 --> 0:3:10,58
people going in.


76
0:3:10,58 --> 0:3:11,65
SHANE SMITH: You're not allowed
to talk to them?


77
0:3:11,65 --> 0:3:12,36
BEN ANDERSON: No, no, no, no.


78
0:3:12,36 --> 0:3:15,79
So we would try and grab them
before they went in and say--


79
0:3:15,79 --> 0:3:18,65
SHANE SMITH: What would happen
if you got caught?


80
0:3:18,65 --> 0:3:19,952
BEN ANDERSON: Well, journalists
in the past have


81
0:3:19,952 --> 0:3:23,18
been imprisoned and been slapped
with massive, massive


82
0:3:23,18 --> 0:3:25,274
fines out there.


83
0:3:25,274 --> 0:3:28,55
First impressions are, if you
didn't know it was a place


84
0:3:28,55 --> 0:3:31,32
where workers lived, you'd think
it was a place where


85
0:3:31,32 --> 0:3:32,54
machinery was stored.


86
0:3:32,54 --> 0:3:37,36
No street lights, can even
smels the sewage.


87
0:3:37,36 --> 0:3:42,583
Just sheets of corrugated iron
protecting rows of huts.


88
0:3:42,583 --> 0:3:44,539
It looks like a shanty town.


89
0:3:44,539 --> 0:3:54,83



90
0:3:54,83 --> 0:3:54,99
So how many?


91
0:3:54,99 --> 0:3:58,272
There's two, four, six eight,
eight people in this room?


92
0:3:58,272 --> 0:3:59,14
WORKER 1: Nine.


93
0:3:59,14 --> 0:4:0,9
BEN ANDERSON: Nine people.


94
0:4:0,9 --> 0:4:1,87
But before we could interview
the workers, the


95
0:4:1,87 --> 0:4:3,12
camp boss turned up.


96
0:4:3,12 --> 0:4:19,18



97
0:4:19,18 --> 0:4:22,11
There was fear among the unit
workers about speaking to us.


98
0:4:22,11 --> 0:4:24,6
They felt they could be sacked
and sent home if they were


99
0:4:24,6 --> 0:4:27,25
discovered speaking out.


100
0:4:27,25 --> 0:4:31,54
That shot is basically my
vision of Dubai now.


101
0:4:31,54 --> 0:4:33,893
All the glittering skyscrapers
on the horizon, and you're in


102
0:4:33,893 --> 0:4:36,71
this sort of black hole
a few miles away.


103
0:4:36,71 --> 0:4:37,96
Which is where these
guys live.


104
0:4:37,96 --> 0:4:55,9



105
0:4:55,9 --> 0:4:55,82
SHANE SMITH: So what are
we going to see now?


106
0:4:55,82 --> 0:4:58,32
BEN ANDERSON: We met an Indian
agent who's been sending


107
0:4:58,32 --> 0:5:1,78
workers to Dubai for years,
making a lot of money.


108
0:5:1,78 --> 0:5:3,52
And they complained to her a
lot, and she just put it down


109
0:5:3,52 --> 0:5:4,6
to them whinging.


110
0:5:4,6 --> 0:5:6,353
But these guys were particularly
persistent, so


111
0:5:6,353 --> 0:5:8,6
she thought she'd investigate.


112
0:5:8,6 --> 0:5:10,75
When she finally found these
guys-- it took her two months


113
0:5:10,75 --> 0:5:13,36
to find these guys-- it made
her so angry that she's now


114
0:5:13,36 --> 0:5:14,54
the first-- as far as I know--


115
0:5:14,54 --> 0:5:18,54
first agent to speak out about
this, and speak out with us.


116
0:5:18,54 --> 0:5:20,79
As we drove into it, she said,
that building over


117
0:5:20,79 --> 0:5:21,602
there, that's it.


118
0:5:21,602 --> 0:5:25,2
You wouldn't even keep cattle
in that building.


119
0:5:25,2 --> 0:5:26,9
The story of the migrant
workers is the


120
0:5:26,9 --> 0:5:28,49
dark side of Dubai.


121
0:5:28,49 --> 0:5:32,44
The side which the annual 1.1
million British visitors to


122
0:5:32,44 --> 0:5:33,356
this country never see.


123
0:5:33,356 --> 0:5:37,79



124
0:5:37,79 --> 0:5:39,4
ALMASS PARDIWALA: We'll see
the living conditions are


125
0:5:39,4 --> 0:5:40,61
really, really appalling.


126
0:5:40,61 --> 0:5:43,765
Almost inhuman conditions
they're been living out here.


127
0:5:43,765 --> 0:5:46,886



128
0:5:46,886 --> 0:5:52,33
This is their very, very, very
basic toilet facilities


129
0:5:52,33 --> 0:5:53,71
available to them.


130
0:5:53,71 --> 0:5:54,82
BEN ANDERSON: That's
the toilet.


131
0:5:54,82 --> 0:5:57,6
Two toilets and one shower
unit for 45 people.


132
0:5:57,6 --> 0:6:0,56
ALMASS PARDIWALA: 45 people.


133
0:6:0,56 --> 0:6:4,2
Right now, I seriously wish the
world would wake up and


134
0:6:4,2 --> 0:6:6,2
look beyond the glitter
to the actual darkness


135
0:6:6,2 --> 0:6:7,29
which is there behind.


136
0:6:7,29 --> 0:6:11,96
I seriously don't think there
is a lot of moral


137
0:6:11,96 --> 0:6:15,16
consciousness amongst the
employers over here.


138
0:6:15,16 --> 0:6:19,22
And I would not say just
one of the companies.


139
0:6:19,22 --> 0:6:22,0
Most of the companies have
absolutely no regard for the


140
0:6:22,0 --> 0:6:24,71
human life or the human
element of this job.


141
0:6:24,71 --> 0:6:26,58
That doesn't [INAUDIBLE].


142
0:6:26,58 --> 0:6:27,49
Absolutely no regard.


143
0:6:27,49 --> 0:6:29,79
No.


144
0:6:29,79 --> 0:6:31,77
BEN ANDERSON: You see they're
building a fire there.


145
0:6:31,77 --> 0:6:34,47
There is a hob in the building,
but there's no gas.


146
0:6:34,47 --> 0:6:36,9
They company doesn't supply
them with gas.


147
0:6:36,9 --> 0:6:38,32
So they just build themselves
a fire out in the back yard.


148
0:6:38,32 --> 0:6:40,72
And that's how they cook
for all 45 men.


149
0:6:40,72 --> 0:6:43,77
SHANE SMITH: So they don't have
water, they don't have


150
0:6:43,77 --> 0:6:45,7
cooking facilities?


151
0:6:45,7 --> 0:6:45,77
BEN ANDERSON: No.


152
0:6:45,77 --> 0:6:46,12
No.


153
0:6:46,12 --> 0:6:47,37
They're completely
independent.


154
0:6:47,37 --> 0:6:49,1
Whatever they get, they scrape
together themselves.


155
0:6:49,1 --> 0:6:51,85
We spoke to guys who said,
all month, they eat


156
0:6:51,85 --> 0:6:53,15
bread, rice, potatoes.


157
0:6:53,15 --> 0:6:54,35
That's all they eat.


158
0:6:54,35 --> 0:6:55,685
I said, what about
meat or fish?


159
0:6:55,685 --> 0:6:56,95
Don't you eat ever
meat or fish?


160
0:6:56,95 --> 0:6:58,47
They said, two or three
times a month they


161
0:6:58,47 --> 0:6:59,8
can eat meat or fish.


162
0:6:59,8 --> 0:7:2,96
And we went into one kitchen,
and we saw the guys cooking


163
0:7:2,96 --> 0:7:5,99
their luxury portion of
fish for the month.


164
0:7:5,99 --> 0:7:7,68
And it was like four guppies.


165
0:7:7,68 --> 0:7:9,5
I mean, four fish
like this big.


166
0:7:9,5 --> 0:7:11,34
That was all it was.


167
0:7:11,34 --> 0:7:13,49
They're easy prey for
recruitment agents in their


168
0:7:13,49 --> 0:7:16,73
home countries, who charge them
huge fees just for the


169
0:7:16,73 --> 0:7:19,36
privilege of working in Dubai.


170
0:7:19,36 --> 0:7:22,83
On average, they pay around
2,000 pounds, a sum of money


171
0:7:22,83 --> 0:7:25,6
so high that they have to
take out loans or sell


172
0:7:25,6 --> 0:7:28,25
family land to pay it.


173
0:7:28,25 --> 0:7:31,84
There are an estimated three
million of these workers in


174
0:7:31,84 --> 0:7:33,34
the United Arab Emirates.


175
0:7:33,34 --> 0:7:35,24
So if they're paying 2,000
pounds each, that's some


176
0:7:35,24 --> 0:7:36,2
serious money.


177
0:7:36,2 --> 0:7:38,34
SHANE SMITH: What's that for?


178
0:7:38,34 --> 0:7:39,25
BEN ANDERSON: It's called
a visa fee.


179
0:7:39,25 --> 0:7:41,58
And it's supposed to cover
the visa and the flight.


180
0:7:41,58 --> 0:7:43,9
Which, of course, is much
less than 2,000 pounds.


181
0:7:43,9 --> 0:7:46,56
But that's what it's called,
the visa fee.


182
0:7:46,56 --> 0:7:50,335
It's actually the fee for the
agent to arrange the privilege


183
0:7:50,335 --> 0:7:52,37
of being able to go and
work in this paradise.


184
0:7:52,37 --> 0:7:55,74
SHANE SMITH: And is there
actually a visa fee that they


185
0:7:55,74 --> 0:7:56,52
have to pay the government?


186
0:7:56,52 --> 0:7:58,44
BEN ANDERSON: It's illegal
for the company or its


187
0:7:58,44 --> 0:8:0,35
representatives to charge
the workers for


188
0:8:0,35 --> 0:8:2,97
the visa or the transport.


189
0:8:2,97 --> 0:8:3,77
NICK MCGEEHAN: There
would be a contract


190
0:8:3,77 --> 0:8:5,38
signed in the host state.


191
0:8:5,38 --> 0:8:7,71
And he would then be
flown to Dubai.


192
0:8:7,71 --> 0:8:9,74
On arrival in Dubai,
that contract would


193
0:8:9,74 --> 0:8:10,98
effectively be ripped up.


194
0:8:10,98 --> 0:8:14,64
He would be paid sometimes
half of what the intended


195
0:8:14,64 --> 0:8:15,98
salary was.


196
0:8:15,98 --> 0:8:18,47
And his passport would
also be confiscated.


197
0:8:18,47 --> 0:8:20,0
BEN ANDERSON: This Scottish
guy is very interesting.


198
0:8:20,0 --> 0:8:22,73
Almass, the Indian agent, was so
outraged by what she found


199
0:8:22,73 --> 0:8:25,11
when she found these workers,
that she wrote to everybody


200
0:8:25,11 --> 0:8:26,25
she could think of.


201
0:8:26,25 --> 0:8:28,21
I mean, obviously everyone in
the Dubai government, but


202
0:8:28,21 --> 0:8:30,38
Amnesty International, Human
Rights-- everybody.


203
0:8:30,38 --> 0:8:31,52
Nobody replied.


204
0:8:31,52 --> 0:8:33,22
He's the only person
that replied.


205
0:8:33,22 --> 0:8:35,77
He used to work for an oil
company in Abu Dhabi and was


206
0:8:35,77 --> 0:8:38,809
so outraged by what he saw being
done to the workers,


207
0:8:38,809 --> 0:8:41,46
that he's now set up an
NGO called Mafiwasta.


208
0:8:41,46 --> 0:8:43,436
And he was the only one that
replied to Almass.


209
0:8:43,436 --> 0:8:44,43
SHANE SMITH: Wow.


210
0:8:44,43 --> 0:8:45,46
So nobody cares.


211
0:8:45,46 --> 0:8:46,132
BEN ANDERSON: No.


212
0:8:46,132 --> 0:8:47,9
SHANE SMITH: So they're the
forgotten slaves of Dubai.


213
0:8:47,9 --> 0:8:48,33
BEN ANDERSON: Yeah, yeah.


214
0:8:48,33 --> 0:8:51,99
Well, they're largely not known
in the first place.


215
0:8:51,99 --> 0:8:54,94
These men were shunted from camp
to camp, before ending up


216
0:8:54,94 --> 0:8:59,34
here, either jobless or forced
to serve out their contracts.


217
0:8:59,34 --> 0:9:1,32
The families they left
behind do not receive


218
0:9:1,32 --> 0:9:2,69
any money from them.


219
0:9:2,69 --> 0:9:4,202
There is no get-out clause.


220
0:9:4,202 --> 0:9:6,29
Even if their passports were
returned to them, they


221
0:9:6,29 --> 0:9:9,41
couldn't afford to go home.


222
0:9:9,41 --> 0:9:11,34
They're trapped.


223
0:9:11,34 --> 0:9:12,96
ALMASS PARDIWALA: Basically,
yes, you can say they are in


224
0:9:12,96 --> 0:9:16,33
kind of a bondage to the company
for the span of the


225
0:9:16,33 --> 0:9:17,95
contract that they are here.


226
0:9:17,95 --> 0:9:19,63
BEN ANDERSON: Isn't
holding passports


227
0:9:19,63 --> 0:9:19,92
supposed to be illegal?


228
0:9:19,92 --> 0:9:20,21
ALMASS PARDIWALA: Illegal?


229
0:9:20,21 --> 0:9:20,58
Yes.


230
0:9:20,58 --> 0:9:22,595
There are a lot of things
which are supposed to be


231
0:9:22,595 --> 0:9:23,8
illegal, but they still
happen here.


232
0:9:23,8 --> 0:9:25,35
And it's very regular.


233
0:9:25,35 --> 0:9:26,2
BEN ANDERSON: That happens
very often.


234
0:9:26,2 --> 0:9:28,48
There are some laws in place.


235
0:9:28,48 --> 0:9:31,35
For example, there was a law
introduced recently where, if


236
0:9:31,35 --> 0:9:34,12
the temperature goes above 50
degrees, I think it is, the


237
0:9:34,12 --> 0:9:36,5
workers are supposed to
down tools and rest


238
0:9:36,5 --> 0:9:38,41
until it gets cooler.


239
0:9:38,41 --> 0:9:41,11
As a result, the temperature
never went above 50 degrees.


240
0:9:41,11 --> 0:9:41,885
SHANE SMITH: How can
it not go above--


241
0:9:41,885 --> 0:9:42,67
BEN ANDERSON: Well, officially
it never


242
0:9:42,67 --> 0:9:43,58
went above 50 degrees.


243
0:9:43,58 --> 0:9:45,22
I mean, it did go above
50 degrees.


244
0:9:45,22 --> 0:9:47,38
But according to official
records, it never went above


245
0:9:47,38 --> 0:9:47,845
50 degrees.


246
0:9:47,845 --> 0:9:50,1
So the workers never
stopped working.


247
0:9:50,1 --> 0:9:53,11
WORKER 1: [SPEAKIING BENGALI]


248
0:9:53,11 --> 0:9:54,88
TRANSLATOR: There is
nothing for me.


249
0:9:54,88 --> 0:9:56,91
I've borrowed from other
people to buy food.


250
0:9:56,91 --> 0:9:58,98
It's been five months, and he
has not paid me at all.


251
0:9:58,98 --> 0:10:2,91



252
0:10:2,91 --> 0:10:5,43
I have begged for good
or remained hungry.


253
0:10:5,43 --> 0:10:8,7
Somehow or other,
I'm surviving.


254
0:10:8,7 --> 0:10:9,56
My wife and children tell
me to send some


255
0:10:9,56 --> 0:10:11,456
money or come back.


256
0:10:11,456 --> 0:10:12,404
Where will I go?


257
0:10:12,404 --> 0:10:14,866
[CRYING]


258
0:10:14,866 --> 0:10:28,48



259
0:10:28,48 --> 0:10:30,32
BEN ANDERSON: It took an hour
for the workers to travel back


260
0:10:30,32 --> 0:10:31,41
to their camp.


261
0:10:31,41 --> 0:10:34,101
They wanted to speak out but
didn't dare reveal their


262
0:10:34,101 --> 0:10:36,59
identities.


263
0:10:36,59 --> 0:10:39,25
Like every other worker we spoke
to in Dubai, they were


264
0:10:39,25 --> 0:10:41,79
in debt and claimed they were
not being paid the money they


265
0:10:41,79 --> 0:10:44,4
were promised by their
recruiting agents.


266
0:10:44,4 --> 0:10:46,89
So I grabbed a hard hat and
snuck into the camp with a


267
0:10:46,89 --> 0:10:48,416
secret camera.


268
0:10:48,416 --> 0:10:50,16
SHANE SMITH: Did you have to
shoot a lot on hidden camera?


269
0:10:50,16 --> 0:10:50,5
BEN ANDERSON: Yeah.


270
0:10:50,5 --> 0:10:52,82
I mean, a lot of the interviews,
all of the footage


271
0:10:52,82 --> 0:10:54,9
inside the camps were
on a hidden camera.


272
0:10:54,9 --> 0:10:55,4
SHANE SMITH: Because
if you get caught,


273
0:10:55,4 --> 0:10:56,65
you can get in trouble.


274
0:10:56,65 --> 0:10:58,67
BEN ANDERSON: And allegedly, the
government have got paid


275
0:10:58,67 --> 0:11:0,7
informants all over the place.


276
0:11:0,7 --> 0:11:1,68
In hotels, taxis, everywhere.


277
0:11:1,68 --> 0:11:4,302
So yeah, you've got to be really
careful out there.


278
0:11:4,302 --> 0:11:7,71
So basically the big sort of
main thoroughfare that


279
0:11:7,71 --> 0:11:13,848
separates the accommodation from
the toilets is just all


280
0:11:13,848 --> 0:11:16,794
deep, thick mud and,
they say, urine and


281
0:11:16,794 --> 0:11:18,758
shit from the toilets.


282
0:11:18,758 --> 0:11:21,213
Actually, the areas around the
toilets are the wettest,


283
0:11:21,213 --> 0:11:25,141
muddiest, and smelliest
areas, so [INAUDIBLE]


284
0:11:25,141 --> 0:11:27,105
telling the truth.


285
0:11:27,105 --> 0:11:30,13
There were so many rivers of
sewage blocking so many of the


286
0:11:30,13 --> 0:11:33,57
walkways that workers had
actually set up a network of


287
0:11:33,57 --> 0:11:36,89
stepping stones to get back
to their accommodation.


288
0:11:36,89 --> 0:11:38,49
SHANE SMITH: So it
must have reeked.


289
0:11:38,49 --> 0:11:39,335
BEN ANDERSON: Yeah.


290
0:11:39,335 --> 0:11:39,68
Horrible.


291
0:11:39,68 --> 0:11:42,26
They said to me, this
is all raw sewage.


292
0:11:42,26 --> 0:11:44,33
And I didn't know whether they
were telling the truth or not.


293
0:11:44,33 --> 0:11:47,46
As soon as you get close
to it, it hits you.


294
0:11:47,46 --> 0:11:48,68
SHANE SMITH: So their toilets
are just going


295
0:11:48,68 --> 0:11:49,76
out onto the streets?


296
0:11:49,76 --> 0:11:52,8
BEN ANDERSON: Yeah.


297
0:11:52,8 --> 0:11:54,125
The areas between the toilet
blocks were the most


298
0:11:54,125 --> 0:11:55,28
disgusting.


299
0:11:55,28 --> 0:11:57,2
There was no doubt that this
is where the problem was


300
0:11:57,2 --> 0:11:58,45
coming from.


301
0:11:58,45 --> 0:12:3,877



302
0:12:3,877 --> 0:12:7,194
I wonder if the water works?


303
0:12:7,194 --> 0:12:10,22
They can't flush it away after
they've used the toilet.


304
0:12:10,22 --> 0:12:12,1
I tried to check every
single tap.


305
0:12:12,1 --> 0:12:14,42
A lot of them, there
was no tap to turn.


306
0:12:14,42 --> 0:12:16,34
A lot of them, you turn it
and no water comes out.


307
0:12:16,34 --> 0:12:18,85
So yeah, they can't flush it
away, and it just sits there.


308
0:12:18,85 --> 0:12:22,196
I got to, I admit, the fourth
or fifth toilet, and I just


309
0:12:22,196 --> 0:12:24,92
started retching because I
couldn't take it anymore.


310
0:12:24,92 --> 0:12:29,94
[SOUND OF RETCHING]


311
0:12:29,94 --> 0:12:31,16
SHANE SMITH: And you're
not a squeamish guy.


312
0:12:31,16 --> 0:12:33,5
You've been to Afghanistan,
you've been to the Congo,


313
0:12:33,5 --> 0:12:35,25
you've been to all the
bad places on Earth.


314
0:12:35,25 --> 0:12:36,53
BEN ANDERSON: I worked as an
undertaker with dead bodies.


315
0:12:36,53 --> 0:12:38,28
SHANE SMITH: You worked
as an undertaker.


316
0:12:38,28 --> 0:12:40,26
So this has got to
be pretty bad.


317
0:12:40,26 --> 0:12:42,67
BEN ANDERSON: And the workers
I spoke to that night said,


318
0:12:42,67 --> 0:12:46,71
this is good, compared
to how it has been.


319
0:12:46,71 --> 0:12:49,67
In a statement, the company
blamed the workers, saying


320
0:12:49,67 --> 0:12:52,13
their "standards of cleanliness
and hygiene are


321
0:12:52,13 --> 0:12:55,54
not up to your or
our standards.


322
0:12:55,54 --> 0:12:57,51
It is very difficult to change
the habits that they


323
0:12:57,51 --> 0:12:59,85
unfortunately bring with them
from their countries of


324
0:12:59,85 --> 0:13:2,9
origin."


325
0:13:2,9 --> 0:13:4,93
Panorama has obtained documents
which reveal it's


326
0:13:4,93 --> 0:13:7,58
more likely to be Arabtec's own
cleaning regime which is


327
0:13:7,58 --> 0:13:8,95
the problem.


328
0:13:8,95 --> 0:13:12,22
A day before I'd filmed in the
camp toilets in January, the


329
0:13:12,22 --> 0:13:14,24
Dubai authorities warned Arabtec
about insufficient


330
0:13:14,24 --> 0:13:16,61
cleaning of toilets.


331
0:13:16,61 --> 0:13:18,94
SHANE SMITH: So the government
knows about it.


332
0:13:18,94 --> 0:13:20,12
What are they doing about it?


333
0:13:20,12 --> 0:13:21,47
BEN ANDERSON: We were quite
impressed that the government


334
0:13:21,47 --> 0:13:23,46
had been there and said the
situation was critical.


335
0:13:23,46 --> 0:13:25,28
But they fined them
2,000 pounds.


336
0:13:25,28 --> 0:13:26,53
SHANE SMITH: And they hadn't
done anything?


337
0:13:26,53 --> 0:13:26,88
BEN ANDERSON: No.


338
0:13:26,88 --> 0:13:28,96
It was still awful
a month later.


339
0:13:28,96 --> 0:13:30,91
And we've put these allegations
to the company,


340
0:13:30,91 --> 0:13:32,94
and they basically say it's
the workers fault.


341
0:13:32,94 --> 0:13:34,77
Trade unions and collective
bargaining


342
0:13:34,77 --> 0:13:36,19
are illegal in Dubai.


343
0:13:36,19 --> 0:13:38,65
With the companies themselves
now suffering because of the


344
0:13:38,65 --> 0:13:41,39
international financial crisis,
the consequences of


345
0:13:41,39 --> 0:13:43,93
complaining are worse
than ever before.


346
0:13:43,93 --> 0:13:46,96
WORKER 1: [SPEAKING BENGALI]


347
0:13:46,96 --> 0:13:49,17
TRANSLATOR: They're telling,
now that you have come, you


348
0:13:49,17 --> 0:13:50,2
stay and work.


349
0:13:50,2 --> 0:13:53,74
If we find any mistakes in
your work, then finish.


350
0:13:53,74 --> 0:13:54,88
Back to Bangladesh.


351
0:13:54,88 --> 0:13:56,4
We will no longer keep you.


352
0:13:56,4 --> 0:13:59,29
If you work well, if the
company prospers in the


353
0:13:59,29 --> 0:14:3,4
future, we will see what can
be arranged for you.


354
0:14:3,4 --> 0:14:4,71
BEN ANDERSON: Do you think
there's a chance things could


355
0:14:4,71 --> 0:14:5,99
improve for you here?


356
0:14:5,99 --> 0:14:6,37
WORKER 1: [SPEAKING BENGALI]


357
0:14:6,37 --> 0:14:8,45
TRANSLATOR: We have no
hope for the future.


358
0:14:8,45 --> 0:14:10,78
We are helpless.


359
0:14:10,78 --> 0:14:13,29
SHANE SMITH: So you've got three
million workers that are


360
0:14:13,29 --> 0:14:14,15
brought over.


361
0:14:14,15 --> 0:14:16,45
Their passports are
taken away.


362
0:14:16,45 --> 0:14:19,6
They're not getting paid the
money that they should.


363
0:14:19,6 --> 0:14:21,34
In fact, they don't have enough
money really, to eat.


364
0:14:21,34 --> 0:14:25,25
They have squalid conditions,
raw sewage.


365
0:14:25,25 --> 0:14:26,64
You just came back from there.


366
0:14:26,64 --> 0:14:31,33
How do you feel coming back
from the City of Lights?


367
0:14:31,33 --> 0:14:33,7
BEN ANDERSON: The reality of
Dubai is the complete opposite


368
0:14:33,7 --> 0:14:35,38
to what you see on television
and in magazines.


369
0:14:35,38 --> 0:14:37,76
In fact, I asked the Indian
agent, I said, what do you


370
0:14:37,76 --> 0:14:40,1
think of now when you see all
these glossy pictures and


371
0:14:40,1 --> 0:14:41,4
videos from Dubai?


372
0:14:41,4 --> 0:14:42,69
She said, now I just
see skeletons.


373
0:14:42,69 --> 0:16:42,69
