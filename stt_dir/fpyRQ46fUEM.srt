1
0:0:6,16 --> 0:0:10,5
The rover has been investigating the YellowKnife
bay area as part of an effort to pick the


2
0:0:10,5 --> 0:0:15,32
exact location of our first drill activity
on Mars.


3
0:0:15,32 --> 0:0:19,57
The images being returned by Curiosity show
a diverse collection of interesting features,


4
0:0:19,57 --> 0:0:26,5
including sedimentary rocks, pebbles, cracks,
nodules, and veins.


5
0:0:26,5 --> 0:0:30,199
The vein features are seen as a bright white
material, and we see them just about everywhere


6
0:0:30,199 --> 0:0:35,47
we look in Yellowknife bay. The Chemcam instrument
has found that these veins contain elevated


7
0:0:35,47 --> 0:0:41,719
levels of calcium sulfate, likely in the form
of bassanite or gypsum. Gypsum veins are also


8
0:0:41,719 --> 0:0:47,95
seen here on Earth and associated with water
percolating through cracks and fractured rocks.


9
0:0:47,95 --> 0:0:51,82
The exciting news from all of this analysis
is the candidate site where Curiosity will


10
0:0:51,82 --> 0:0:55,17
conduct its first drilling activity.


11
0:0:55,17 --> 0:0:59,3
This site is located only a few meters away
from the rover's current location, and lies


12
0:0:59,3 --> 0:1:1,46
in a flat area, suitable for drilling.


13
0:1:1,46 --> 0:1:5,46
The team hopes to drill directly into one
of the veins and place the powder into the


14
0:1:5,46 --> 0:1:9,75
SAM and ChemMin analytical instruments. These
instruments will give us detailed information


15
0:1:9,75 --> 0:1:12,209
about the composition of the material. We'll
be driving over there in the next few days.


16
0:1:12,209 --> 0:1:15,69
We began our first drilling campaign at the
site we named John Klein.


17
0:1:15,69 --> 0:1:19,2
John Klein has an area that has a set of flat
"plate-y" rocks that are perfect for the first


18
0:1:19,2 --> 0:1:20,38
use of the drill.


19
0:1:20,38 --> 0:1:24,53
We were able to place the arm safely and drill
vertically down into the rock to collect as


20
0:1:24,53 --> 0:1:26,319
much sample as possible.


21
0:1:26,319 --> 0:1:31,69
We started by making a very small divot to
test the hammering mechanism in the drill.


22
0:1:31,69 --> 0:1:35,6
This worked perfectly, so we proceeded on
to make a mini hole.


23
0:1:35,6 --> 0:1:37,91
Our mini drill test drilled 2 centimeters
down into the rock


24
0:1:37,91 --> 0:1:41,78
We compared the tailings created by the mini
drill to the extensive set of test rocks that


25
0:1:41,78 --> 0:1:46,229
we drilled here on Earth here at JPL and determine
that what we see on Mars are safe to ingest


26
0:1:46,229 --> 0:1:47,289
in the system.


27
0:1:47,289 --> 0:1:50,149
After these preparations we were all very
excited to move on to ready to move on to


28
0:1:50,149 --> 0:1:51,479
the big event.


29
0:1:51,479 --> 0:1:53,95
We drilled 6-and-a-half centimeters down into
the rock.


30
0:1:53,95 --> 0:1:56,75
We used the camera at the end of the arm to
take pictures.


31
0:1:56,75 --> 0:2:0,569
Here we see two holes, first on the right
is the mini drill hole and in the center of


32
0:2:0,569 --> 0:2:2,149
the picture, we have the full hole.


33
0:2:2,149 --> 0:2:5,42
The gray tailing tells us that there's something
different about the inside of this rock than


34
0:2:5,42 --> 0:2:6,97
the surface of the rock.


35
0:2:6,97 --> 0:2:10,539
In the coming weeks, one of the things we're
trying to do with this first hole is to use


36
0:2:10,539 --> 0:2:14,35
this gray powder that we collect to clean
the internal surfaces of the drill.


37
0:2:14,35 --> 0:2:17,59
We do that by moving the arm and swishing
the powder around.


38
0:2:17,59 --> 0:2:21,42
This was a great week for Curiosity. We got
to see something we've all been waiting for


39
0:2:21,42 --> 0:2:26,49
quite some time: sample in the scoop confirming
that our first drill on Mars collected as


40
0:2:26,49 --> 0:2:27,9
we had expected.


41
0:2:27,9 --> 0:2:31,18
This was an important event as this is the
first time the drill has been used on Mars


42
0:2:31,18 --> 0:2:34,74
to collect sample for analysis by instruments
on the rover.


43
0:2:34,74 --> 0:2:41,88
We use these computer-generated images to
help us visually identify how much we've collected.


44
0:2:41,88 --> 0:2:47,21
We were able to estimate that we collected
about 14 cubic centimeters of sample, or about


45
0:2:47,21 --> 0:2:51,63
a tablespoon, and this matched our expectations
of what we would see in the scoop when we


46
0:2:51,63 --> 0:2:53,2
got to this point.


47
0:2:53,2 --> 0:2:57,64
Our drilling capability gives us the ability
to get inside this rock. The first thing you


48
0:2:57,64 --> 0:3:2,21
notice about the material is that it's a different
color. Gray not the reddish orange color on


49
0:3:2,21 --> 0:3:7,2
the surface all around us. That reddish orange
color is a sign of an iron oxidation. A kind


50
0:3:7,2 --> 0:3:10,4
of rusting process that's occurred all around
on Mars.


51
0:3:10,4 --> 0:3:14,72
The next steps for the team are to finish
processing the sample with Chimera and then


52
0:3:14,72 --> 0:3:20,22
put small portions into the SAM and Chemin
instruments for analysis of chemistry and


53
0:3:20,22 --> 0:3:21,38
mineralogy.


54
0:3:21,38 --> 0:3:26,12
This week the Curiosity science team released
its initial findings from its first ever drilled


55
0:3:26,12 --> 0:3:30,87
sample on Mars. This sample was collected
from the "John Klein" drill site, which is


56
0:3:30,87 --> 0:3:35,569
located about 500 meters east of where we
landed about 7 months ago.


57
0:3:35,569 --> 0:3:41,1
Curiosity obtained her first drill sample
and passed that sample on to her onboard analytical


58
0:3:41,1 --> 0:3:46,0
lab instruments, called CheMin and SAM. These
powerful instruments tell us about what minerals


59
0:3:46,0 --> 0:3:50,44
are present in these rocks and whether they
contain the ingredients necessary to sustain


60
0:3:50,44 --> 0:3:52,19
life as we know it.


61
0:3:52,19 --> 0:3:57,39
What the Curiosity team has found is incredibly
exciting. When we combine what we have learned


62
0:3:57,39 --> 0:4:1,98
from our remote sensing and contact science
instruments with the data that's coming in


63
0:4:1,98 --> 0:4:7,28
from CheMin and SAM, we get a picture of an
ancient watery environment, which would have


64
0:4:7,28 --> 0:4:10,39
been habitable had life been present in it.


65
0:4:10,39 --> 0:4:13,94
As an example, the information that we're
getting from the CheMin instrument, tells


66
0:4:13,94 --> 0:4:18,709
us that the minerals that are present in this
lakebed sedimentary rock at John Klein are


67
0:4:18,709 --> 0:4:23,52
very different from just about anything we've
ever analyzed before on Mars. And they tell


68
0:4:23,52 --> 0:4:28,34
us that the John Klein rock was deposited
in a fresh water environment.


69
0:4:28,34 --> 0:4:33,1
This is an important contrast with other sedimentary
environments that we've visited on Mars, like


70
0:4:33,1 --> 0:4:37,4
the Meridiani Planum landing site where the
Mars Exploration Rover, Opportunity, has been


71
0:4:37,4 --> 0:4:38,9
operating since 2004.


72
0:4:38,9 --> 0:4:44,27
At that site, the sedimentary rocks record
evidence of an environment that was only wet


73
0:4:44,27 --> 0:4:49,15
on a very intermittent basis, and when it
was, the waters that were there were highly


74
0:4:49,15 --> 0:4:54,66
acidic, very salty, and not favorable for
the survival of organic compounds.


75
0:4:54,66 --> 0:4:58,5
This is in direct contrast to the fresh water
environment we're seeing here at the John


76
0:4:58,5 --> 0:4:59,43
Klein Site.


77
0:4:59,43 --> 0:5:3,32
The SAM instrument is telling us that these
rocks contained all of the ingredients necessary


78
0:5:3,32 --> 0:5:8,84
for a habitable environment. We found carbon,
sulfur and oxygen, all present and a number


79
0:5:8,84 --> 0:5:11,52
of other elements in states that life could
have taken advantage of.


80
0:5:11,52 --> 0:5:15,53
All in all, these few tablespoons of powder
from a Martian rock have provided the Curiosity


81
0:5:15,53 --> 0:5:20,31
science team with an exciting new dataset
that tells us that Gale Crater, and perhaps


82
0:5:20,31 --> 0:5:25,3
all of Mars, contained habitable environments.
This is an incredible success for the Curiosity


83
0:5:25,3 --> 0:5:29,59
mission to Gale, and the science team is looking
forward to digging deeper into Mars' ancient


84
0:5:29,59 --> 0:7:29,59
watery past in the weeks, months, and years
ahead.
