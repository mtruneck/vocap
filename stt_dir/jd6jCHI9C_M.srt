1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:3,22



2
0:0:3,22 --> 0:0:5,2
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: The most
important thing to know about


3
0:0:5,2 --> 0:0:8,83
fresh water in California is
that there just isn't enough.


4
0:0:8,83 --> 0:0:11,64
The second thing you quickly
find out is that the state's


5
0:0:11,64 --> 0:0:14,11
no stranger to full-on
water wars.


6
0:0:14,11 --> 0:0:17,57
Basically, whoever controls
the water in California


7
0:0:17,57 --> 0:0:19,78
controls the future.


8
0:0:19,78 --> 0:0:23,55
Currently the dominant player in
the state's big agriculture


9
0:0:23,55 --> 0:0:25,6
is Paramount Farms,
which is owned and


10
0:0:25,6 --> 0:0:27,7
operated by Stewart Resnick.


11
0:0:27,7 --> 0:0:30,55
Stewart's goals have recently
aligned very closely with


12
0:0:30,55 --> 0:0:32,549
Governor Jerry Brown's.


13
0:0:32,549 --> 0:0:34,55
WALT GRAY: California's water
war is heating up.


14
0:0:34,55 --> 0:0:37,89
The governor has just unveiled
a new $14 billion plan to


15
0:0:37,89 --> 0:0:41,2
build two tunnels underneath the
delta, transferring water


16
0:0:41,2 --> 0:0:44,39
from northern California
to southern California.


17
0:0:44,39 --> 0:0:47,25
The governor says his plan will
create a reliable water


18
0:0:47,25 --> 0:0:49,1
supply and still maintain
a healthy


19
0:0:49,1 --> 0:0:51,3
ecosystem in the delta.


20
0:0:51,3 --> 0:0:53,27
Not everyone agrees.


21
0:0:53,27 --> 0:0:55,12
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: That's
why we came out west.


22
0:0:55,12 --> 0:0:57,84
We wanted a firsthand look into
the newest chapter of


23
0:0:57,84 --> 0:0:59,472
California's water works.


24
0:0:59,472 --> 0:1:10,32



25
0:1:10,32 --> 0:1:13,146
So, our first job was to meet
Congressman John Garamendi,


26
0:1:13,146 --> 0:1:15,12
who has been fighting
Jerry Brown's water


27
0:1:15,12 --> 0:1:20,7
proposals since the '70s.


28
0:1:20,7 --> 0:1:23,41
JOHN GARAMENDI: This proposal
goes back at least 40 years.


29
0:1:23,41 --> 0:1:27,5
Jerry Brown, in the 1970s, when
he was governor, wanted


30
0:1:27,5 --> 0:1:31,5
to build this system, got it
through the legislature.


31
0:1:31,5 --> 0:1:34,61
I and several other folks
decided that was a bad thing


32
0:1:34,61 --> 0:1:35,38
and we fought it.


33
0:1:35,38 --> 0:1:36,76
We had a referendum.


34
0:1:36,76 --> 0:1:39,32
And now he's back.


35
0:1:39,32 --> 0:1:43,59
He said it very clearly, I'm
going to do it this time.


36
0:1:43,59 --> 0:1:45,77
What are you going
to do, governor?


37
0:1:45,77 --> 0:1:50,8
You're so determined to relive
your old life that you want to


38
0:1:50,8 --> 0:1:51,7
destroy this thing?


39
0:1:51,7 --> 0:1:54,55
You want to build a system that
would destroy the largest


40
0:1:54,55 --> 0:1:56,96
estuary on the west coast of
the Western hemisphere?


41
0:1:56,96 --> 0:1:58,45
Is that what this is
all about, just so


42
0:1:58,45 --> 0:2:0,24
you say I did it?


43
0:2:0,24 --> 0:2:2,375
It's the north versus
the south.


44
0:2:2,375 --> 0:2:4,16
It's the war of water
in California.


45
0:2:4,16 --> 0:2:8,15
It's been going on since the
gold rush, and it's continuing


46
0:2:8,15 --> 0:2:9,4
to this day.


47
0:2:9,4 --> 0:2:13,21



48
0:2:13,21 --> 0:2:15,57
ADAM KEATS: This area right here
is the point at which the


49
0:2:15,57 --> 0:2:18,89
water leaves the public realm
and enters the private realm,


50
0:2:18,89 --> 0:2:19,415
so to speak.


51
0:2:19,415 --> 0:2:24,58
The equation is solely focused
on big, Southern California


52
0:2:24,58 --> 0:2:25,31
agribusiness.


53
0:2:25,31 --> 0:2:28,4
Huge mega-corporations that are
some of the largest farm


54
0:2:28,4 --> 0:2:30,93
interests in the world,
producing big-money crops.


55
0:2:30,93 --> 0:2:33,25
And that's the primary thing
driving this thing.


56
0:2:33,25 --> 0:2:35,34
And no one has a right
to own the water.


57
0:2:35,34 --> 0:2:37,1
It doesn't mean you can totally
deprive the rest of


58
0:2:37,1 --> 0:2:40,26
the state of its access
to the water--


59
0:2:40,26 --> 0:2:42,27
and when I say rest of the
state, that includes the fish


60
0:2:42,27 --> 0:2:44,74
and the birds and the animals.


61
0:2:44,74 --> 0:2:48,76
Early on, in the early 2000s,
mid 2000s, we noticed huge


62
0:2:48,76 --> 0:2:51,39
declines of fish species
in the delta.


63
0:2:51,39 --> 0:2:55,36
6 million splittail were killed
in one count, and


64
0:2:55,36 --> 0:2:58,23
14,000, 15,000 salmon.


65
0:2:58,23 --> 0:3:1,81
Instead of having the power in
one interest, the San Joaquin


66
0:3:1,81 --> 0:3:5,44
Valley farmers-- and that's
primarily one company,


67
0:3:5,44 --> 0:3:6,71
Paramount Farms--


68
0:3:6,71 --> 0:3:9,54
instead of having one big boy
controlling the whole game,


69
0:3:9,54 --> 0:3:12,66
have the state control it, and
have the state control with


70
0:3:12,66 --> 0:3:15,5
very strict rules, in terms of
who gets water, when they get


71
0:3:15,5 --> 0:3:16,65
water, why they get water.


72
0:3:16,65 --> 0:3:19,61
And include in that mix all
the birds and fish in the


73
0:3:19,61 --> 0:3:21,29
environment and ecosystem
up here.


74
0:3:21,29 --> 0:3:23,52
But you can answer all the
questions just by figuring out


75
0:3:23,52 --> 0:3:25,57
where the money is, who's
making the most


76
0:3:25,57 --> 0:3:27,62
money off the deal.


77
0:3:27,62 --> 0:3:29,13
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: Moving large
amounts of water from


78
0:3:29,13 --> 0:3:32,16
one place to another
isn't anything new.


79
0:3:32,16 --> 0:3:34,79
But the water from the San
Joaquin delta is already


80
0:3:34,79 --> 0:3:35,82
spoken for.


81
0:3:35,82 --> 0:3:39,37
By law, farmers who have lived
here in the San Joaquin Valley


82
0:3:39,37 --> 0:3:44,15
for over 250 years still
maintain priority rights over


83
0:3:44,15 --> 0:3:45,69
the delta's water.


84
0:3:45,69 --> 0:3:49,9
They get it first, and their
livelihoods depend on it.


85
0:3:49,9 --> 0:3:50,51
RUDY MUSSI: My father
was a farmer.


86
0:3:50,51 --> 0:3:53,23
I farm with my brother,
and I've done that


87
0:3:53,23 --> 0:3:55,19
for the last 50 years.


88
0:3:55,19 --> 0:3:59,61
All this proposal does is just
steal the water from one area


89
0:3:59,61 --> 0:4:1,77
and ship it to another area.


90
0:4:1,77 --> 0:4:5,11
The reasoning changes
all the time.


91
0:4:5,11 --> 0:4:9,92
At first, it was to enhance the
aquatic species out here.


92
0:4:9,92 --> 0:4:14,63
Well, the Academy of Science
said the peripheral tunnels or


93
0:4:14,63 --> 0:4:17,41
canal won't enhance
the species.


94
0:4:17,41 --> 0:4:21,32
So then they said, well, we'll
do adaptive management.


95
0:4:21,32 --> 0:4:23,1
So, in other words, we're going
to build this and then


96
0:4:23,1 --> 0:4:25,17
we'll figure it out
how to work it.


97
0:4:25,17 --> 0:4:29,34
We fought this battle in 1982,
and I think my dad fought this


98
0:4:29,34 --> 0:4:32,6
battle in the '50s
and the '60s.


99
0:4:32,6 --> 0:4:34,86
It's always been somebody trying
to steal our water.


100
0:4:34,86 --> 0:4:39,9
Anytime there's a finite amount
of water, there's


101
0:4:39,9 --> 0:4:44,9
always somebody that doesn't
have it that wants it.


102
0:4:44,9 --> 0:4:46,32
And don't get me wrong.


103
0:4:46,32 --> 0:4:49,13
We don't mind sharing any
surplus water, but


104
0:4:49,13 --> 0:4:50,65
don't take my water.


105
0:4:50,65 --> 0:4:52,1
I depend on it for
my livelihood.


106
0:4:52,1 --> 0:4:54,92



107
0:4:54,92 --> 0:4:56,39
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: Right now,
we're heading into Clarksburg,


108
0:4:56,39 --> 0:5:0,44
where we're going to film where
they want to begin these


109
0:5:0,44 --> 0:5:1,69
new tunnels.


110
0:5:1,69 --> 0:5:9,59



111
0:5:9,59 --> 0:5:12,87
Sacramento River, chilling
on a private levee.


112
0:5:12,87 --> 0:5:15,27
Snuck out here so we can
see it for ourselves.


113
0:5:15,27 --> 0:5:18,96
If Jerry Brown's peripheral
canal proposal goes through,


114
0:5:18,96 --> 0:5:23,71
they'll take two large tunnels
underground, right under here,


115
0:5:23,71 --> 0:5:28,45
and 9,000 cubic inches of water
per second will be taken


116
0:5:28,45 --> 0:5:32,53
from Sacramento River all
the way down south.


117
0:5:32,53 --> 0:5:35,89
And basically, all the farmers
out here are completely


118
0:5:35,89 --> 0:5:37,42
dependent on this water.


119
0:5:37,42 --> 0:5:41,34
Potentially, that could
all end as quickly as


120
0:5:41,34 --> 0:5:42,59
shutting off a faucet.


121
0:5:42,59 --> 0:5:48,6



122
0:5:48,6 --> 0:5:51,6
John Herrick is one of a number
of lawyers working to


123
0:5:51,6 --> 0:5:52,2
stop the Bay Delta


124
0:5:52,2 --> 0:5:54,31
conservation plan from approval.


125
0:5:54,31 --> 0:5:56,72
Along with a number of
colleagues, John's been on the


126
0:5:56,72 --> 0:5:58,37
job for about 30
years already.


127
0:5:58,37 --> 0:6:1,3



128
0:6:1,3 --> 0:6:2,92
JOHN HERRICK: Their proposal is,
we're going to improve the


129
0:6:2,92 --> 0:6:5,54
delta by moving our intake.


130
0:6:5,54 --> 0:6:8,57
So their plan is to make the
delta better by having less


131
0:6:8,57 --> 0:6:12,75
fresh water flow through it.


132
0:6:12,75 --> 0:6:14,27
It's that nuts.


133
0:6:14,27 --> 0:6:16,42
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: Why does
the Department of Water


134
0:6:16,42 --> 0:6:21,55
Resources and the Department of
the Interior want them to


135
0:6:21,55 --> 0:6:23,16
have those water rights?


136
0:6:23,16 --> 0:6:24,99
JOHN HERRICK: That's an
interesting question.


137
0:6:24,99 --> 0:6:25,62
I don't know.


138
0:6:25,62 --> 0:6:28,62
One of the things that should
be separated, but isn't, is


139
0:6:28,62 --> 0:6:33,48
the fact that the Department of
Water Resources is a seller


140
0:6:33,48 --> 0:6:34,84
to the contractors.


141
0:6:34,84 --> 0:6:38,74
So large amounts of money go
from the people who want the


142
0:6:38,74 --> 0:6:41,22
water, exporters, to
the department.


143
0:6:41,22 --> 0:6:43,9
That connection of buyer-seller
has resulted in


144
0:6:43,9 --> 0:6:47,64
the Department of Water
Resources following the


145
0:6:47,64 --> 0:6:51,24
desires of their clients,
their buyers.


146
0:6:51,24 --> 0:6:53,23
In our opinion, although we
haven't figured out a way,


147
0:6:53,23 --> 0:6:54,38
there are people that
should be put in


148
0:6:54,38 --> 0:6:55,678
jail for these things.


149
0:6:55,678 --> 0:7:1,426



150
0:7:1,426 --> 0:7:3,86
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: All right,
so basically, all of the


151
0:7:3,86 --> 0:7:8,38
proponents of the peripheral
canal have pointed us in the


152
0:7:8,38 --> 0:7:11,58
direction of the Department
of Water Resources.


153
0:7:11,58 --> 0:7:14,17
But unfortunately, after we
set up an appointment with


154
0:7:14,17 --> 0:7:19,14
them, they claimed that they
heard some things about us and


155
0:7:19,14 --> 0:7:22,53
decided to cancel our 2
o'clock appointment.


156
0:7:22,53 --> 0:7:24,55
So it is 10 o'clock now.


157
0:7:24,55 --> 0:7:27,24
We figure we might jump in,
because we have to hear from


158
0:7:27,24 --> 0:7:30,283
their side, and their reasons
behind wanting


159
0:7:30,283 --> 0:7:31,73
this peripheral canal.


160
0:7:31,73 --> 0:7:39,5



161
0:7:39,5 --> 0:7:42,318
Yeah, we're doing
an interview.


162
0:7:42,318 --> 0:7:43,312
How's it going?


163
0:7:43,312 --> 0:7:45,8
-Oh, you know.


164
0:7:45,8 --> 0:7:47,275
I work for state parks.


165
0:7:47,275 --> 0:7:49,9
How good can it be?


166
0:7:49,9 --> 0:7:51,59
-This too shall pass.


167
0:7:51,59 --> 0:7:52,84
-It's entertaining.


168
0:7:52,84 --> 0:8:0,66



169
0:8:0,66 --> 0:8:1,54
EMERSON ROSENTHAL:
Uh, yeah we did.


170
0:8:1,54 --> 0:8:26,24
For 10 o'clock, originally.


171
0:8:26,24 --> 0:8:30,11
The secretary was sharp enough
to divert us away from the


172
0:8:30,11 --> 0:8:32,419
building and not let
us talk to anybody.


173
0:8:32,419 --> 0:8:33,659
But we got some good pizza


174
0:8:33,659 --> 0:8:35,85
recommendations, so we're cool.


175
0:8:35,85 --> 0:8:39,57



176
0:8:39,57 --> 0:8:42,799
Once we got back to New York, we
realized that after all of


177
0:8:42,799 --> 0:8:45,23
our appointments were canceled
with the Department of Water


178
0:8:45,23 --> 0:8:48,56
Resources, the Natural Resources
Agency, and the


179
0:8:48,56 --> 0:8:51,64
chemist who helped back the
proposal's science, we didn't


180
0:8:51,64 --> 0:8:54,63
have a single statement from
the proponents of the plan,


181
0:8:54,63 --> 0:8:56,7
let alone a positive one.


182
0:8:56,7 --> 0:8:58,85
So we tried again.


183
0:8:58,85 --> 0:9:3,17
OK, so I just found the list
of all of the supporters.


184
0:9:3,17 --> 0:9:5,877
This is everybody who
is a proponent of


185
0:9:5,877 --> 0:9:7,69
the peripheral canal.


186
0:9:7,69 --> 0:9:9,577
Let's see if we can
talk to somebody.


187
0:9:9,577 --> 0:9:12,379
[PHONE RINGING]


188
0:9:12,379 --> 0:9:14,946
-Financial Resources Agency,
this is Kim, how may


189
0:9:14,946 --> 0:9:16,5
I direct your call?


190
0:9:16,5 --> 0:9:16,55
Hi there.


191
0:9:16,55 --> 0:9:19,14
My name is Emerson Rosenthal,
and I'm calling on behalf of


192
0:9:19,14 --> 0:9:19,98
Vice Media.


193
0:9:19,98 --> 0:9:20,3
OK.


194
0:9:20,3 --> 0:9:21,345
Can you hold for just
one second?


195
0:9:21,345 --> 0:9:24,344
Let me see if there's
somebody available.


196
0:9:24,344 --> 0:9:27,56
Hi, this is Nancy Vogel,
director of public affairs for


197
0:9:27,56 --> 0:9:27,51
the department.


198
0:9:27,51 --> 0:9:29,14
Hi, you've reached [INAUDIBLE]


199
0:9:29,14 --> 0:9:31,6
with Paramount Farms, please
leave a message and I will


200
0:9:31,6 --> 0:9:32,48
return your call.


201
0:9:32,48 --> 0:9:35,63
We had someone here in the
office that covers Bay Delta.


202
0:9:35,63 --> 0:9:37,37
They're not in right now, you
can leave a message--


203
0:9:37,37 --> 0:9:38,46
Were you the woman that
sent us to that


204
0:9:38,46 --> 0:9:40,39
really great pizza place?


205
0:9:40,39 --> 0:9:40,876
Yes.


206
0:9:40,876 --> 0:9:42,334
That's me.


207
0:9:42,334 --> 0:9:42,82
OK.


208
0:9:42,82 --> 0:9:44,26
Oh good, you guys liked
Zelda's, after all?


209
0:9:44,26 --> 0:9:46,518
Yeah, it was delicious.


210
0:9:46,518 --> 0:9:48,8
Just one second, let me see if
there's somebody available.


211
0:9:48,8 --> 0:9:50,33
Will you please hold for
just one second?


212
0:9:50,33 --> 0:9:50,645
One moment.


213
0:9:50,645 --> 0:9:50,96
Thank you.


214
0:9:50,96 --> 0:9:51,66
One moment.

EMERSON ROSENTHAL: The only
response we got was an email


217
0:10:5,55 --> 0:10:8,16
from the governor's press
office, with a link to their


218
0:10:8,16 --> 0:10:10,3
press release.


219
0:10:10,3 --> 0:10:12,34
In the meantime, the governor's
been hard at work


220
0:10:12,34 --> 0:10:15,36
pushing the proposal past a
legislative vote, in spite of


221
0:10:15,36 --> 0:10:16,35
the opposition.


222
0:10:16,35 --> 0:10:19,47
JERRY BROWN: This proposal
balances the concerns of those


223
0:10:19,47 --> 0:10:22,43
who live and work on the delta,
those who rely on it


224
0:10:22,43 --> 0:10:25,62
for water, and those who
appreciate its beauty, its


225
0:10:25,62 --> 0:10:28,7
fish, waterfowl and wildlife.


226
0:10:28,7 --> 0:10:30,16
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: So we'll have
to go with that as their


227
0:10:30,16 --> 0:10:31,6
official statement.


228
0:10:31,6 --> 0:10:34,26
And with all lines of
communication cut off between


229
0:10:34,26 --> 0:10:36,916
the designers of the plan and
the people asking questions,


230
0:10:36,916 --> 0:10:39,79
the Bay Delta conservation plan
is quickly becoming an


231
0:10:39,79 --> 0:10:42,91
imminent reality in the haze
of California politics.


232
0:10:42,91 --> 0:10:45,76
Will governor Jerry Brown win
the water war he's been waging


233
0:10:45,76 --> 0:10:46,98
since the '70s?


234
0:10:46,98 --> 0:10:50,37
Is this a new precedent for
controlling water in America?


235
0:10:50,37 --> 0:10:52,82
In the words of Detective Walsh,
in perhaps the most


236
0:10:52,82 --> 0:10:56,18
famous film about California's
water, "Forget it, Jake.


237
0:10:56,18 --> 0:10:56,68
It's Chinatown."
