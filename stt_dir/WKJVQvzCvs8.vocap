###25 MALE SPEAKER: Whoa.
###26 
###32 SEAN MALTO: The first time I ever heard of Eric Koston?
###34 
###36 You know what?
###38 It was probably "Yeah Right." Like, that was
###42 way later, I know.
###43 Like, there's so much of Eric before that I never really
###47 realize, but like, "Yeah Right" and that whole video
###50 coming out was probably the first time I'd
###53 ever heard of him.
###56 And I saw the trailer, and it was him yelling at some kid.
###60 And I knew he was the best, you know, Eric Koston having
###64 last par, and just being that dude at the time was crazy.
###69 He did an ollie backside noseblunt at Arco.
###71 I learned an ollie backside noseblunt like two weeks ago.
###75 And for him to do it at Arco, like, 2003.
###81 That is crazy.
###83 ATIBA JEFFERSON: It's always fun to watch Eric get a video
###85 deadline, because that's when he starts like, fuck this, I'm
###89 doing this, we're getting tricks.
###91 You know, tray flip noseblunt slide in "Yeah Right."
###94 It's an hour and a half away, Santa Barbara, and we just
###96 drove up right to get that trick.
###98 And that's what he did.
###100 Drove up there at night, lit it up, got it, and came home.
###103 And to me that, that's like a Michael Jordan moment.
###109 Like, he literally took over the game and won it.
###114 TY EVANS: He was just killing stuff.
###116 I remember going to like that big hub ledge in Philly, and
###120 he just destroyed that thing.
###122 180 nose grind, black lip, like did all
###124 that stuff over then.
###125 And then, like when he went out to Japan and skated that
###128 white hub, and just murdered that thing, and did a ton of
###130 shit on that.
###131 ATIBA JEFFERSON: He did so many tricks on this hub in
###134 that one night.
###135 And this whole trip, it was him, McCrank, and Rodrigo.
###138 And Rodrigo got sick, and literally him and McCrank were
###141 like, just two fucking wild dogs doing
###144 demos and skating street.
###146 They were very tight at that point.
###148 GUY MARIANO: Eric and Rick McCrank.
###150 That was a good combo.
###152 Because Rick is like, just like Eric.
###154 He's super good.
###155 Tranny, rail, gap, whatever.
###157 And I think McCrank, being like a bigger rail skater at
###160 that time, he really pushed Eric to start doing some
###163 bigger rails and bigger gaps.
###165 And like, in that "Yeah Right" thing, you see them feeding
###167 off each other.
###169 I like the Rick McCrank and Eric Koston better than the
###172 Guy Mariano Eric Koston.
###175 My opinion.
###176 MALE SPEAKER: You were dragging him down.
###177 GUY MARIANO: I was dragging Eric down, and
###178 Rick brought him up.
###179 MALE SPEAKER: You were like, let's [INAUDIBLE].
###181 GUY MARIANO: I'm trying to get Eric to bum walls, McCrank's
###184 getting him to the double kinks.
###185 
###188 TY EVANS: The early, early 2000 era of Eric, he was
###192 unstoppable.
###192 Dudes are in their prime in their certain time where all
###195 that stuff works, and like, that was like his chunk right
###197 there where he was just killing it.
###201 Back then, all that stuff came, like, so quick that like
###204 now, it's like, forget it.
###206 Guys are like, checking the wind.
###208 Fucking, every distraction in the world's like, crazy now.
###214 
###217 ERIC KOSTON: 2001 Reader's Choice Award.
###219 Best all around skater.
###222 You know, now it's pretty high pressure, where when we
###224 started, it was pretty fun.
###226 Now it's like a virus, or some antibiotic.
###232 You know?
###234 It only works for so long, and then the virus gets stronger.
###238 That's how I look at it.
###240 Like guys, OK, that trick was gnarly.
###242 Now it's not gnarly.
###243 Now it's just like, another trick in the bag.
###246 MIKE CARROLL: That's one thing I've felt sorry for him about,
###250 is just like, seeing how much pressure I would assume he
###253 puts on himself.
###254 ERIC KOSTON: Aw, you son of a bitch.
###257 MIKE CARROLL: And he feels that everyone's expecting,
###259 like, I wouldn't even want to have that.
###263 MALE SPEAKER: For filming "Fully Flared," did he have a
###265 lot of the pressure that some of the other
###267 dudes talk about, or?
###269 KELLY BIRD: Yeah.
###269 I feel like he did, because he was the guy that like, came in
###273 and really was like, the final piece of the puzzle.
###276 Where everybody was like, oh my God.
###277 Look, OK.
###278 This is going to be ridiculous.
###279 Like, the guy thing was already in motion.
###281 Everything else had been going for so long, and then it's
###283 like, oh, here comes this dude to like ice the whole thing.
###287 So I'm sure he felt the pressure to be like, well,
###289 everybody's going to expect me to have like the last part,
###294 caliber part.
###295 And then having a year and a half, maybe fucking a little
###298 bit longer than that at best to do it.
###300 I'm sure it wasn't the most pleasurable thing for him.
###303 MALE SPEAKER: A lot of people thought that you kind of came
###306 in just to film the part, and that the plan
###308 was to leave anyway.
###311 That's what I heard.
###311 ERIC KOSTON: That pretty absurd to think that I would
###314 come in just to film a part and then leave.
###317 Timewise, you just don't have that kind of luxury in life to
###320 be just bouncing around.
###321 The thing is, when Lakai started, I'd been a long time
###324 at S. My contract was up, and I wanted to feel like, sort of
###329 secure at where I was going to end up at that point on.
###334 I wanted to have, like, some sort of stake in a company.
###337 At a brand that I, you know, back and believe in.
###343 And that's what I thought.
###345 And we had come out with like, a pretty fucking insane video
###350 with "Fully Flared." Probably one of the best marketing
###354 tools a brand could come up with.
###357 You know what I mean?
###358 I guess it didn't translate.
###360 KELLY BIRD: His business manager unearthed some stuff
###363 that was going on, that I think people either just
###366 didn't take the time to realize, or were just too busy
###370 that they didn't, you know what I mean?
###371 They didn't have the time to deal with it previous to that.
###373 But that really was a point where everybody was like OK,
###378 some shit's going on here that's probably not that great
###381 for the brand.
###383 TIM GAVIN: That sucked.
###384 He just came on at a shitty time.
###386 And he quit.
###390 It really affected me and him in our relationship.
###393 And you always hear business and friends, and it sucked.
###397 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###397 TIM GAVIN: You know, if I were to do it all over again, man,
###399 I would never, I would've fucking never have done it.
###402 You know, Rick and the Girl guys, those guys, like, were
###404 so close, and they're family.
###406 I mean, literally, like were just so close.
###408 So I always wanted to do something with them.
###410 And for it to not work out is really hard to deal with.
###413 ERIC KOSTON: I didn't know what else to do.
###416 I'd sort of had to take just the choice of making kind of a
###421 life decision.
###423 Of like, having to--
###425 I've got to go and do what's best for me.
###429 MALE SPEAKER: Did you know you were going to go to Nike?
###431 ERIC KOSTON: No, when I left Lakai, no.
###433 I left knowing I'm just going to go out and
###436 like, free agent style.
###438 I mean, if you asked me five years earlier, I'd have been
###440 like, fuck no.
###441 Fuck those dudes.
###442 Fuck that place.
###443 Fuck that.
###444 No, I don't fucking trust them.
###445 You remember the fucking first run they did?
###447 It sucked.
###448 But after time, seeing like, how they run things and what
###452 they do, and how they get behind their team.
###455 It's crazy how far it's come along in skateboarding.
###459 It's like, skateboarding's this huge responsibility to
###462 Nike, you know what I mean?
###464 That we all have.
###466 Now, looking back at all my shoes that I
###470 designed I copied Nikes.
###473 it's all these Jordans and Nikes.
###475 MALE SPEAKER: And now you can make a shoe that, like,
###477 someone else is going to copy.
###478 ERIC KOSTON: Hopefully, that's like--
###480 MALE SPEAKER: You're like, the starting point.
###481 ERIC KOSTON: Yeah.
###482 
###485 It's a great spot.
###486 
###493 SEAN MALTO: When he does something, he kind of gets
###496 involved in it to the fullest.
###498 Like, Four Star, Girl, Nike, whatever sponsors he has, he
###502 kind of like, fully gets into it.
###505 You know, now that he's like, doing Oakley stuff, has a lot
###508 of responsibilities.
###508 But he's handling it well, and he's had like, a great career.
###513 And if I've ever learned anything from
###515 him, it's like, yeah.
###516 You know what I mean?
###517 You gotta work for it.
###519 This shit doesn't just like, come to you.
###521 You've got to like, work hard towards something, and just
###526 try to do it right.
###527 And I think that's what he's done.
###528 He's done a great job at it.
###530 
###535 GUY MARIANO: There's a lot of people that think that he was
###537 just a great skateboarder, and everything just
###539 fell into his lap.
###540 But that's not true.
###541 Like, Eric worked really hard.
###543 He battled for his stuff, you know what I mean?
###545 Like, he put together like, over 15 video parts like
###548 "Bangers," you know what I mean?
###550 Like, I don't need another Koston "Banger" video part to
###554 know that he's amazing.
###555 You know what I mean?
###556 I have tons of that.
###557 It makes me happy to see him with his family, like, doing
###560 good, and being almost like the Michael
###563 Jordan of our industry.
###564 And I can say that, and a lot of people will back that.
###568 ERIC KOSTON: This is Finn.
###570 FEMALE SPEAKER: Finny.
###570 ERIC KOSTON: Yeah?
###572 You want me to help you on your skateboard?
###573 FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###574 ERIC KOSTON: OK.
###575 I have to like, tighter her wheels up.
###576 I tighten the wheels up, too.
###578 But still, it's like, I've gotta crank them even more.
###581 MALE SPEAKER: You know, us at Girl, and just skateboarding
###583 in general, we've always looked to Eric to show us the
###586 way, and that's why he is Eric Koston.
###589 ERIC KOSTON: Take your paci out when you skate.
###592 It's safer.
###593 FEMALE SPEAKER: It goes back and forth.
###594 ERIC KOSTON: It does.
###595 It goes back and forth.
###597 MALE SPEAKER: Have you ever seen your dad skate?
###600 ERIC KOSTON: She saw me at a contest.
###601 I think it was like a Maloof, or something.
###605 But she was there.
###607 And she was following me the whole way, I guess, and like,
###609 laughing and like, tripping out.
###612 I don't think she could even talk then.
###615 That's so sick.
###616 
###618 Sketchy.
###620 Stay on your knees.
###620 Whoa.
###621 Stay on your knees, June.
###623
