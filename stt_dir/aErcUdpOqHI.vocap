###0 MALE SPEAKER 1: And now, the CEO of K-Swiss, Kenny Powers.
###2 [APPLAUSE]
###3 KENNY POWERS: Woo hoo, yeah!
###5 Kenny fucking Powers!
###6 Come on, raise it up!
###8 Woo hoo!
###8 Come on!
###9 There you go, two at you!
###11 Let me hear fucking more!
###12 [APPLAUSE]
###12 KENNY POWERS: All right, cool!
###13 OK.
###14 OK, OK, shut the fuck up!
###17 I have a dream, a wet dream, and today you get the pleasure
###22 of witnessing my dream come true.
###26 The way I see it, there's three things an athlete needs
###29 to succeed.
###31 Talent, strippers, and most importantly, speed.
###35 Because speed is what takes an athlete to the next level.
###39 Today, it's time to unleash my greatest creation ever, my
###43 magnum fucking opus, Blades!
###46 [APPLAUSE]
###50 [MUSIC]
###52 KENNY POWERS: Witness and behold the world's most
###54 advanced running shoe.
###55 
###57 He's doing the running man, get it?
###59 That's hilarious.
###60 Look how nimble he is.
###61 OK, running man, that's cool.
###63 You're overdoing it now.
###63 You're making yourself look stupid.
###65 Get the fuck out of here.
###66 Now, let me give you a sneak peek into the
###69 brilliant mind of me.
###72 Yo, word.
###73 Welcome to the K-Swiss R and double D lab.
###76 Double D for development, and also for huge tits.
###79 Come on in.
###80 
###86 Cool science, dog.
###88 In order to create a shoe that will make an athlete run
###90 faster than fuck, I not only watch how fast
###91 this cheetah runs.
###92 I watch how that motherfucker kills.
###94 Suck it, slow ass animal.
###96 What's up?
###97 Me and my smart as hell scientists here have developed
###100 what I like to call speed activated technology.
###102 Run slow and the blades will become soft and pillowy, like
###105 these awesome things.
###106 Or, flip the fucking turbo switch and
###108 blades will react quickly.
###110 Like a spring loaded shotgun for your fucking feet parts.
###113 Nice work, dickheads.
###114 But next level technology like this doesn't mean jack shit if
###117 it doesn't translate to peak performance on game day.
###120 That's why I enlisted the help of all pro
###121 linebacker Patrick Willis.
###122 PATRICK WILLIS: Aah!
###123 KENNY POWERS: See if he can run this motherfucker through
###124 some tests.
###125 Fuck that wildebeest up!
###127 PATRICK WILLIS: [YELLING]
###128 Aah!
###129 
###132 KENNY POWERS: Willis, that is fucking bad ass!
###133 That is how I invented Blades.
###135 [APPLAUSE]
###136 KENNY POWERS: As for the name, I got to give credit where
###138 credit is due.
###139 To a Chinese man by the name of Bruce.
###144 Ni Hao, player.
###145 You're fucking blown up these days.
###147 You got like a bagillion Facebook fans.
###149 BRUCE LEE: Definitely, definitely.
###150 [LAUGHING]
###150 KENNY POWERS: Whoa, whoa.
###151 Don't get cocky on me there kimosabe.
###153 BRUCE LEE: I meant that as a joke, of course.
###154 [LAUGHTER]
###154 KENNY POWERS: All right, time for serious.
###156 Remember that time when me and you were fucking around in
###158 your dojo playing with swords and shit and those derelicts
###160 tried to step to us?
###161 BRUCE LEE: Violence man.
###162 [LAUGHTER]
###162 KENNY POWERS: Oh yeah, that was violence.
###163 Well while you were busy tearing them a new asshole, I
###165 saw something.
###166 You see these motherfuckers?
###168 These little scratches on your titties, they were the
###170 inspiration for the name Blades.
###172 BRUCE LEE: And it's a heck of a name, man.
###174 KENNY POWERS: Yeah, no shit.
###174 I came up with it.
###175 BRUCE LEE: All type of knowledge ultimately means
###179 self knowledge.
###182 Now you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup--.
###185 KENNY POWERS: OK, how about this?
###187 How about instead of doing all this poetry shit, we just go
###189 fuck some dudes up with this blade, huh?
###191 BRUCE LEE: [LAUGHTER]
###192 KENNY POWERS: [LAUGHTER]
###193 Woo!
###195 [APPLAUSE]
###195 KENNY POWERS: Yep, that was me.
###197 That exchange was completely real.
###199 But all this blood, sweat, and innovation doesn't mean a
###201 goddamn thing if we don't get feet in the shoes.
###205 So we're making Saturday morning commercials
###207 specifically for the soft little minds of children.
###209 Let's get these kids fucking hooked on speed!
###211 
###215 All right ladies, let's see what these blades can do.
###217 
###220 Fuck yeah, Blades!
###222 Woo!
###223 Speed!
###224 Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
###225 You just shit your pants, nerd.
###227 Blades!
###228 Woo!
###229 
###231 Aw shit, evil dude.
###234 Run fast or die, hombre.
###235 
###237 Speed!
###238 Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
###239 Speed!
###240 
###243 Take that, fuckers!
###246 Blades, go buy them.
###247 [APPLAUSE]
###251 [MUSIC]
###256 [ASTRONAUT BREATHING]
###261 KENNY POWERS: Walking on the--
###263 fuck.
###265 Walking on the moon was the greatest thing that man had
###269 ever done, until now.
###272 I've basically taken all the fastest shit I've ever seen--
###274 bionic missiles, fucking Bruce Lee, cheetahs--
###277 and I've combined them together to make the best shoe
###281 you've ever seen.
###283 You may applaud now.
###284 [APPLAUSE]
###285 KENNY POWERS: Oh yeah, water on the moon feels just right.
###290 What do you ladies say we take a trip to Uranus?
###293 You get it?
###293 MALE SPEAKER 2: Blades.
###295
