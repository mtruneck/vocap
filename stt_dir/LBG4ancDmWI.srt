1
0:0:9,559 --> 0:0:13,509
In this Crochet for Knitters Series weíve
been covering a lot of different techniques,


2
0:0:13,509 --> 0:0:16,109
and finally we get to put them together for
a project.


3
0:0:16,109 --> 0:0:19,13
And weíre going to learn how to make granny
squares here.


4
0:0:19,13 --> 0:0:23,199
And when I say granny squares, I mean these
squares like this.


5
0:0:23,199 --> 0:0:30,89
In this little sample here, these are squares
that are this big, that are all seamed together


6
0:0:30,89 --> 0:0:32,79
like this.


7
0:0:32,79 --> 0:0:39,97
And you can do it that way, or I have this
long-term project here [laughs] excuse me.


8
0:0:39,97 --> 0:0:46,7
Where I am making one giant granny square,
without seaming anything together.


9
0:0:46,7 --> 0:0:50,79
And Iím using leftover yarn for this. And
so this is a really long term project because


10
0:0:50,79 --> 0:0:56,29
Iím collecting more dk weight yarn. Or, this
is actually fingering weight yarn, to keep


11
0:0:56,29 --> 0:0:57,769
making this project.


12
0:0:57,769 --> 0:1:2,29
And Iíve used a lot of yarn so far, and now
Iím waiting for more leftovers so I can keep


13
0:1:2,29 --> 0:1:3,39
working on this.


14
0:1:3,39 --> 0:1:8,229
But, the granny squares work up really quickly,
itís an easy way to make a blanket, a quick


15
0:1:8,229 --> 0:1:9,52
way to make a blanket.


16
0:1:9,52 --> 0:1:15,679
And so far in these crochet techniques, weíve
been stabbing into stitches, which can be


17
0:1:15,679 --> 0:1:18,2
hard to get your crochet hook in there.


18
0:1:18,2 --> 0:1:23,46
This goes so much faster. Because granny squares,
we stab into these big gaps that are created


19
0:1:23,46 --> 0:1:25,3
when we chain.


20
0:1:25,3 --> 0:1:26,149
It will all be clear in just a minute.


21
0:1:26,149 --> 0:1:29,659
Letís go ahead and get started right away
with this.


22
0:1:29,659 --> 0:1:33,869
Oh! There is a download associated with this
video. If youíd like to get your free copy


23
0:1:33,869 --> 0:1:38,689
of the granny squares pattern, you can click
the link below, take you to my website, and


24
0:1:38,689 --> 0:1:39,74
you can get your pattern.


25
0:1:39,74 --> 0:1:45,289
Okay, letís take a look.


26
0:1:45,289 --> 0:1:49,399
Here we are, weíre going to start with a
slip knot, like we always do.


27
0:1:49,399 --> 0:1:56,39
Iím going to chain four.


28
0:1:56,39 --> 0:1:58,17
Okay.


29
0:1:58,17 --> 0:2:5,88
Weíre going to make a chain ring with this,
so I want to connect this around to itself.


30
0:2:5,88 --> 0:2:9,619
Actually, for demonstration, Iím going to
go ahead and chain an extra one.


31
0:2:9,619 --> 0:2:14,45
I want to slip stitch into this stitch here,
and Iím going to slip stitch into the left


32
0:2:14,45 --> 0:2:17,0
leg of this stitch.


33
0:2:17,0 --> 0:2:22,33
If you need a review of the slip stitch, Iíll
give you a link here.


34
0:2:22,33 --> 0:2:28,6
So Iíll stab into there, pull up a loop,
and pull it through the second one as well.


35
0:2:28,6 --> 0:2:31,51
Ta-da! We have a tiny ring.


36
0:2:31,51 --> 0:2:36,349
Now granny squares are just a bunch of clusters
of three double crochets together.


37
0:2:36,349 --> 0:2:41,3
Iím going to chain three to get myself setup
to work a double crochet.


38
0:2:41,3 --> 0:2:45,829
And if you need a review of double crochet,
Iíll give you a link right here.


39
0:2:45,829 --> 0:2:52,72
Iím going to yarn over, stab into the center
of the ring, grab a loop and pull it up, giving


40
0:2:52,72 --> 0:2:57,989
me three loops on the hook, grab the yarn
pull through two, grab the yarn pull through


41
0:2:57,989 --> 0:2:58,599
two.


42
0:2:58,599 --> 0:3:2,18
Just a regular double crochet.


43
0:3:2,18 --> 0:3:7,329
Yarn over, stab into the center of the ring,
grab the yarn and pull up a loop, grab the


44
0:3:7,329 --> 0:3:9,92
yarn pull through two, grab the yarn pull
through two.


45
0:3:9,92 --> 0:3:14,0
Iím going to smush those together, those
double crochets.


46
0:3:14,0 --> 0:3:17,3
What I have here, when I start out itís a
bit different than the rest of it.


47
0:3:17,3 --> 0:3:21,879
I have a chain three here, then I have a double
crochet and a double crochet.


48
0:3:21,879 --> 0:3:25,989
It looks like three double crochets, because
we are counting that chain three as the first


49
0:3:25,989 --> 0:3:27,299
double crochet.


50
0:3:27,299 --> 0:3:28,969
So that counts as a cluster of three.


51
0:3:28,969 --> 0:3:31,579
Iím going to chain two.


52
0:3:31,579 --> 0:3:41,53
And Iím going to work another cluster of
double crochets.


53
0:3:41,53 --> 0:4:0,849
Okay, I actually worked three this time, smush
those around.


54
0:4:0,849 --> 0:4:2,549
Chain two.


55
0:4:2,549 --> 0:4:6,129
And work another cluster.


56
0:4:6,129 --> 0:4:15,609
And while youíre working through this, I
am working kind of quickly, you can just pause


57
0:4:15,609 --> 0:4:24,56
the video to catch up, and work your double
crochets, and then we can essentially move


58
0:4:24,56 --> 0:4:26,97
on to the next step together.


59
0:4:26,97 --> 0:4:32,759
So now I have one, two, three clusters of
double crochets. I need to work one more.


60
0:4:32,759 --> 0:4:43,389
Chain two.


61
0:4:43,389 --> 0:4:59,25
Okay. Four clusters of three double crochets,
chain two.


62
0:4:59,25 --> 0:5:6,99
And I want to connect this into, umm, kind
of a circle, kind of a square, at this point.


63
0:5:6,99 --> 0:5:11,21
So Iím going to slip stitch into one, two,
the third chain.


64
0:5:11,21 --> 0:5:13,59
This is the chain three that we did right
at the beginning.


65
0:5:13,59 --> 0:5:20,21
Iím going to slip stitch into this third
chain.


66
0:5:20,21 --> 0:5:23,319
And there we are.


67
0:5:23,319 --> 0:5:25,39
Take a look at this.


68
0:5:25,39 --> 0:5:32,62
You should have four distinct gaps, where
you chained two, with a double crochet cluster


69
0:5:32,62 --> 0:5:33,83
between each one.


70
0:5:33,83 --> 0:5:40,919
And it is already looking like a square.


71
0:5:40,919 --> 0:5:45,9
Go ahead and catch up with me, and what weíve
done here, and next up weíre going to move


72
0:5:45,9 --> 0:5:57,819
on to the next round, or the second round.


73
0:5:57,819 --> 0:6:0,96
Hopefully youíve caught up with me and youíve
finished your first round, weíre going to


74
0:6:0,96 --> 0:6:4,259
go into the second round of the granny square.


75
0:6:4,259 --> 0:6:8,699
And when I work granny squares ñ you can
do all kinds of different things with colors


76
0:6:8,699 --> 0:6:11,8
and the way you put them together and everything
else.


77
0:6:11,8 --> 0:6:15,24
Iím kind of stuck on this thing where I change
colors every two rounds.


78
0:6:15,24 --> 0:6:17,84
So we did the first round in this red color.


79
0:6:17,84 --> 0:6:20,819
Iím going to continue with the second round
in this red color.


80
0:6:20,819 --> 0:6:22,599
Letís go ahead and take a look.


81
0:6:22,599 --> 0:6:25,74
Hereís a granny square that I did.


82
0:6:25,74 --> 0:6:30,46
And thereís my first round, and thereís
my second round, in pink.


83
0:6:30,46 --> 0:6:34,44
And then I changed to this cream color for
the third and fourth round, and then I did


84
0:6:34,44 --> 0:6:39,62
border colors in this green, for the fifth
and sixth round.


85
0:6:39,62 --> 0:6:41,919
Okay.


86
0:6:41,919 --> 0:6:45,229
Here we are with our first round finished.


87
0:6:45,229 --> 0:6:49,2
And we were stabbing into the center circle
for the first round.


88
0:6:49,2 --> 0:6:55,39
Weíre going to be stabbing into these four
corner gaps right here, for the second round.


89
0:6:55,39 --> 0:6:56,919
And our working loop is right here.


90
0:6:56,919 --> 0:7:0,44
We need to travel over to get to this gap
here.


91
0:7:0,44 --> 0:7:7,49
And to do that, Iím going to slip stitch,
usually I find that just two slipped stitches


92
0:7:7,49 --> 0:7:9,18
will get me close enough to this gap.


93
0:7:9,18 --> 0:7:18,0
Iím going to slip stitch into the back leg
the right leg, I guess of the V here, grab


94
0:7:18,0 --> 0:7:23,4
the yarn, pull through both, stab, grab the
yarn, pull through both.


95
0:7:23,4 --> 0:7:27,659
And then I want to slip stitch into this gap.


96
0:7:27,659 --> 0:7:32,15
So I stab into the gap, grab the yarn, pull
up a loop, pull it through the loop on the


97
0:7:32,15 --> 0:7:32,53
hook.


98
0:7:32,53 --> 0:7:36,53
Let me show you that one more time.


99
0:7:36,53 --> 0:7:40,21
Stab into the gap, grab the yarn and pull
up a loop, then pull it through the loop on


100
0:7:40,21 --> 0:7:40,789
the hook.


101
0:7:40,789 --> 0:7:44,8
Okay, now Iím actually in this gap and ready
to start working.


102
0:7:44,8 --> 0:7:49,3
So I chain three to get started, get myself
set up for double crochet.


103
0:7:49,3 --> 0:8:0,2
And Iím going to work ñ you guessed it.
Another cluster of three double crochets.


104
0:8:0,2 --> 0:8:5,99
Just like with the first row, that first chain
that I did counts as one of the double crochets.


105
0:8:5,99 --> 0:8:8,22
So one, two, three, chain two.


106
0:8:8,22 --> 0:8:20,99
And Iím going to work a second cluster into
this same corner.


107
0:8:20,99 --> 0:8:30,3
Okay.


108
0:8:30,3 --> 0:8:35,5
So I have two clusters of three double crochets
with a chain two between them in this corner.


109
0:8:35,5 --> 0:8:38,659
Iím ready to travel over and start working
in this corner.


110
0:8:38,659 --> 0:8:44,76
Iím going to chain one this time. We only
chain two on the corners, we chain one when


111
0:8:44,76 --> 0:8:47,4
weíre working across to the next corner.


112
0:8:47,4 --> 0:9:5,11
Iím going to work my first cluster.


113
0:9:5,11 --> 0:9:8,29
Chain two.


114
0:9:8,29 --> 0:9:16,38
[laughs] My working yarn fell on the floor
a long time ago, and I didnít bother picking


115
0:9:16,38 --> 0:9:21,38
it up [laughs], so Iím just going to pull
a bunch of yarn on the table.


116
0:9:21,38 --> 0:9:32,62
You notice Iím always squishing the stitches
over to make room for the next one.


117
0:9:32,62 --> 0:9:33,43
Okay.


118
0:9:33,43 --> 0:9:42,19
One, two, three, chain two, one, two, three.
Iím ready to travel over to the next gap,


119
0:9:42,19 --> 0:9:46,55
so I chain one.


120
0:9:46,55 --> 0:9:58,95
And work two more double crochet clusters.


121
0:9:58,95 --> 0:10:19,74
Smush those over, chain two.


122
0:10:19,74 --> 0:10:27,31
Chain one to move on to the next gap.


123
0:10:27,31 --> 0:10:31,44
You see how much more quickly this goes when
youíre not carefully stabbing into a stitch.


124
0:10:31,44 --> 0:10:36,709
I think thatís the slowest part of crochet,
is when you have to really watch where youíre


125
0:10:36,709 --> 0:10:40,42
putting your hook into the work. And you just
donít with granny squares.


126
0:10:40,42 --> 0:10:42,56
Chain two.


127
0:10:42,56 --> 0:10:47,49
Work my second cluster.


128
0:10:47,49 --> 0:10:51,93
Okay.


129
0:10:51,93 --> 0:11:0,339
Iím going to chain one here, because Iím
traveling over to this one.


130
0:11:0,339 --> 0:11:4,62
And just like we did with the first round,
I need to connect this side to this side.


131
0:11:4,62 --> 0:11:12,19
So I count up one, two, three, and slip stitch
into that stitch to connect them.


132
0:11:12,19 --> 0:11:15,35
Now let me straighten this out so we can take
a look.


133
0:11:15,35 --> 0:11:19,6
I should have four distinct corners.


134
0:11:19,6 --> 0:11:27,269
With a chain one gap between each one.


135
0:11:27,269 --> 0:11:35,1
Next up in round three, Iím going to show
you how to change colors.


136
0:11:35,1 --> 0:11:42,26
Okay, hopefully youíve caught up with finishing
that round.


137
0:11:42,26 --> 0:11:45,769
Weíre going to move on to the third round,
and change colors this time.


138
0:11:45,769 --> 0:11:49,19
Letís go ahead and take a look.


139
0:11:49,19 --> 0:11:53,29
This is exactly where we left off in the last
video, I have this one loop left here.


140
0:11:53,29 --> 0:11:57,81
And all Iím going to do is just break the
yarn, and pull that through, just like how


141
0:11:57,81 --> 0:12:0,23
we fasten off in knitting.


142
0:12:0,23 --> 0:12:6,73
Now, last time, we had to travel with slip
stitches over to get to the next gap.


143
0:12:6,73 --> 0:12:10,1
When you change colors you donít have to
do that.


144
0:12:10,1 --> 0:12:16,66
Umm, I apologize for the colors here. I guess
itís kind of christmasey looking. [laughs]


145
0:12:16,66 --> 0:12:20,5
But, it should be easy to see, at least!


146
0:12:20,5 --> 0:12:23,399
I am going to start in a corner. Because I
always start a new color in a corner.


147
0:12:23,399 --> 0:12:25,55
You can start in a side gap if you like.


148
0:12:25,55 --> 0:12:29,839
But I am going to stab into a corner, and
just like when Iím attaching new yarn when


149
0:12:29,839 --> 0:12:34,42
Iím knitting, Iím going to fold the yarn
over, leaving myself about a six inch tail,


150
0:12:34,42 --> 0:12:38,66
and make a loop, put that on the hook and
pull up a loop.


151
0:12:38,66 --> 0:12:42,48
Now to get started weíre going to chain three.
To get started with double crochet I want


152
0:12:42,48 --> 0:12:43,209
to chain three.


153
0:12:43,209 --> 0:12:49,11
The one thing that I like to do to help secure
the tail end is I hold both strands together


154
0:12:49,11 --> 0:12:53,949
for the chain three.


155
0:12:53,949 --> 0:13:3,76
Okay. So my end is kind ofÖuhh, Itís probably
pretty much woven in there. I might want to


156
0:13:3,76 --> 0:13:6,37
weave it in a little bit more, but itís pretty
much woven in.


157
0:13:6,37 --> 0:13:10,19
Now Iím going to work two clusters of three
double crochet in this corner.


158
0:13:10,19 --> 0:13:14,209
Anyway, thatís the way to change colors.
You really just start working with it, and


159
0:13:14,209 --> 0:13:16,89
chain up.


160
0:13:16,89 --> 0:13:20,67
Oh, this yarn is so much smoother than the
red yarn!


161
0:13:20,67 --> 0:13:25,99
So again, just like with the other corners,
the chain three that I did counts as double


162
0:13:25,99 --> 0:13:32,26
crochet, Iím did two more, Iím going to
chain two ñ Iím sorry, Iím going to chain


163
0:13:32,26 --> 0:13:38,76
one. Because Iím going to travel over to
this side gap here.


164
0:13:38,76 --> 0:13:43,49
And Iím going to work one cluster of double
crochets in this side gap.


165
0:13:43,49 --> 0:13:47,589
This is where it starts to get a little bit
different. Because the sides are becoming


166
0:13:47,589 --> 0:13:49,139
longer.


167
0:13:49,139 --> 0:13:50,959
So not everything is a corner anymore.


168
0:13:50,959 --> 0:13:54,36
It will be clear here in just a minute.


169
0:13:54,36 --> 0:14:0,3
So Iím going to chain one to travel over
here.


170
0:14:0,3 --> 0:14:10,579
To work two double crochet clusters in this
corner.


171
0:14:10,579 --> 0:14:18,1
And after I get these worked, I will go over
again how the pattern is emerging here.


172
0:14:18,1 --> 0:14:39,949
Hereís one, Iím going to chain two, because
itís a corner.


173
0:14:39,949 --> 0:14:41,47
Okay, letís talk about what we just did.


174
0:14:41,47 --> 0:14:44,97
Whoops! I only worked one over here in this
corner!


175
0:14:44,97 --> 0:14:47,6
I need a second one! But I can catch it on
the way over.


176
0:14:47,6 --> 0:14:50,44
Okay, letís just look at the part I did here.
[laughs]


177
0:14:50,44 --> 0:14:56,4
We have two clusters of double crochets here,
because itís a corner.


178
0:14:56,4 --> 0:14:59,0
We have just one cluster here, because itís
a side.


179
0:14:59,0 --> 0:15:1,529
And Iím going to work a second one here.


180
0:15:1,529 --> 0:15:5,67
If I had been thinking about it, I would have
worked the second one while I was there, but


181
0:15:5,67 --> 0:15:10,17
since itís the beginning of the row, I can
just work it in there when I get all the way


182
0:15:10,17 --> 0:15:12,13
around the whole side.


183
0:15:12,13 --> 0:15:16,72
So now, as I go over to this side, I have
this side gap here, where Iím going to work


184
0:15:16,72 --> 0:15:18,61
one double crochet cluster.


185
0:15:18,61 --> 0:15:20,769
And I have the corner, where Iím going to
work two.


186
0:15:20,769 --> 0:15:26,269
When Iím traveling from one gap to the next,
I chain one between.


187
0:15:26,269 --> 0:15:32,279
So Iím going to chain one, one double crochet
cluster, chain one, and then a double crochet


188
0:15:32,279 --> 0:15:36,93
cluster here, chain two, a second double crochet
cluster in here.


189
0:15:36,93 --> 0:15:40,0
Letís actually do it.


190
0:15:40,0 --> 0:15:45,69
Chain one.


191
0:15:45,69 --> 0:15:50,389
One cluster of three double crochets.


192
0:15:50,389 --> 0:15:53,5
I should have been working with this yarn
all along! It is so smooth!


193
0:15:53,5 --> 0:15:57,529
It has baby alpaca in it.


194
0:15:57,529 --> 0:15:58,88
Chain one.


195
0:15:58,88 --> 0:16:14,569
To travel over to this gap.


196
0:16:14,569 --> 0:16:37,48
Chain two after the first cluster.


197
0:16:37,48 --> 0:16:43,41
And there you have it. You continue that around
for this whole round.


198
0:16:43,41 --> 0:16:47,44
And then from here on out, the only thing
that really changes is that youíre going


199
0:16:47,44 --> 0:16:51,6
to end up with more side gaps, thatís what
I call them.


200
0:16:51,6 --> 0:16:56,259
There is always going to be four corners,
but youíll have more side gaps like these


201
0:16:56,259 --> 0:17:5,92
here, where youíll work a cluster of one
in each one.


202
0:17:5,92 --> 0:17:10,12
If you follow the pattern, it will tell you
exactly how to continue working for the other


203
0:17:10,12 --> 0:17:11,329
rounds.


204
0:17:11,329 --> 0:17:24,3
Next up, Iím going to show you how to seam
the granny squares together.


205
0:17:24,3 --> 0:17:28,63
As I mentioned at the beginning of this lesson,
you have the option of doing a bunch of granny


206
0:17:28,63 --> 0:17:34,33
squares and seaming them together like this,
or you can keep working around and around,


207
0:17:34,33 --> 0:17:39,15
like I did here, where itís just one giant
granny square with no seaming.


208
0:17:39,15 --> 0:17:44,19
I will tell you that if you choose to do it
this way, youíre going to need greater and


209
0:17:44,19 --> 0:17:48,83
greater and greater amounts of yarn to actually
make it all the way around the whole thing!


210
0:17:48,83 --> 0:17:51,21
[laughs] in one color.


211
0:17:51,21 --> 0:17:55,68
Which is one of the reasons this project is
on hold until I get a lot more of this weight


212
0:17:55,68 --> 0:17:58,49
of yarn to keep working on that leftover blanket.


213
0:17:58,49 --> 0:18:1,4
Okay, Iím going to show you how to seam here.


214
0:18:1,4 --> 0:18:6,14
And crocheted seaming is really easy to do.
Easier than mattress stitch. Letís go ahead


215
0:18:6,14 --> 0:18:9,6
and take a look.


216
0:18:9,6 --> 0:18:13,78
I have these two giant granny squares finished
here.


217
0:18:13,78 --> 0:18:18,96
And crochet isnít all that different from
the right side to the wrong side.


218
0:18:18,96 --> 0:18:22,72
But the wrong side youíll have your tail
end, hopefully sticking out on the wrong side,


219
0:18:22,72 --> 0:18:27,8
and the stitches look a little flatter.


220
0:18:27,8 --> 0:18:31,79
Once you look at it, crochet for a while,
it becomes easy to tell which is which.


221
0:18:31,79 --> 0:18:35,54
The reason Iím mentioning this is because
weíre going to seam on the wrong side of


222
0:18:35,54 --> 0:18:35,77
the work.


223
0:18:35,77 --> 0:18:38,6
Weíre going to have the wrong side of the
work facing out.


224
0:18:38,6 --> 0:18:41,43
And Iím actually going to turn it this way.


225
0:18:41,43 --> 0:18:45,8
Now, the sides of the crochet looks like a
bind off row.


226
0:18:45,8 --> 0:18:50,83
With a bunch of Vs, and thatís exactly how
weíre going to be ñ thatís exactly what


227
0:18:50,83 --> 0:18:53,11
weíre going to work into as we seam.


228
0:18:53,11 --> 0:18:59,89
Weíre going to find the bottom corner over
here on this first one, and Iím going to


229
0:18:59,89 --> 0:19:5,8
work into the bottom V, or what I would call
the right leg of the V.


230
0:19:5,8 --> 0:19:8,23
Iím going to stab into there.


231
0:19:8,23 --> 0:19:13,15
And then over here, my Vs are going this way,
Iím going to work into the top leg of the


232
0:19:13,15 --> 0:19:13,78
V.


233
0:19:13,78 --> 0:19:17,96
So Iím leaving a leg of V on the inside of
the work.


234
0:19:17,96 --> 0:19:19,38
Or on the right side of the work.


235
0:19:19,38 --> 0:19:24,12
So I stab into both of those, and this is
really just slip stitch.


236
0:19:24,12 --> 0:19:28,86
Iím going to attach the yarn. If you were
thinking ahead, you could have left long tails,


237
0:19:28,86 --> 0:19:30,61
I suppose, at the end of your work.


238
0:19:30,61 --> 0:19:35,1
Iím going to fold the yarn over, leaving
myself like a six inch tail to weave in.


239
0:19:35,1 --> 0:19:38,92
Loop it around the hook, and pull it through
both loops.


240
0:19:38,92 --> 0:19:47,72
Then again, Iím going to stab into the outside
leg of the top, and the outside leg of the


241
0:19:47,72 --> 0:19:57,2
bottom.


242
0:19:57,2 --> 0:20:2,94
Grab the yarn and pull it through all three
loops.


243
0:20:2,94 --> 0:20:9,17
Outside leg, outside leg. Whoops, I grabbed
too much there.


244
0:20:9,17 --> 0:20:10,99
Grab the yarn and pull it through all three
loops.


245
0:20:10,99 --> 0:20:13,57
Iím slip stitching these, as I seam them.


246
0:20:13,57 --> 0:20:19,29
And I want to show you what Iím talking about
here, why weíre grabbing the outside legs.


247
0:20:19,29 --> 0:20:22,37
Because it gives you this border, between
the squares.


248
0:20:22,37 --> 0:20:27,43
By leaving the leg of the V on the right side
of the work and just grabbing the ones on


249
0:20:27,43 --> 0:20:31,6
the outside, it gives you this border, which
is really nice.


250
0:20:31,6 --> 0:20:34,79
If you donít want the border, you can stab
through both legs of the V, and have it go


251
0:20:34,79 --> 0:20:36,92
like that, but I think it looks good.


252
0:20:36,92 --> 0:20:43,83
Let me show you again.


253
0:20:43,83 --> 0:20:48,25
Stab into the outside leg, the outside leg,
grab the yarn, and pull it through all three


254
0:20:48,25 --> 0:20:56,27
loops.


255
0:20:56,27 --> 0:20:57,35
You see how quickly this goes.


256
0:20:57,35 --> 0:21:7,15
And itís not just because Iím using super
bulky yarn, this really does go quickly.


257
0:21:7,15 --> 0:21:10,95
Whoops.


258
0:21:10,95 --> 0:21:17,78
Letís take a quick look at how this looks
on the right side.


259
0:21:17,78 --> 0:21:23,5
Youíll see that border that I was talking
about, showing up here like this.


260
0:21:23,5 --> 0:21:28,45
Doesnít it look good?


261
0:21:28,45 --> 0:21:31,82
Now when youíre seaming granny squares, I
recommend that you do it just like you were


262
0:21:31,82 --> 0:21:34,83
seaming blocks in knitting.


263
0:21:34,83 --> 0:21:38,88
Seam blocks together all the way across to
make a long strip.


264
0:21:38,88 --> 0:21:42,56
And then seam the long strips together.


265
0:21:42,56 --> 0:21:48,64
So seam these boxes together this way, and
then seam the long strips together like that.


266
0:21:48,64 --> 0:21:52,71
And that will do it! Youíre well on your
way to making your granny square blanket!


267
0:21:52,71 --> 0:21:55,34
Good luck.


268
0:21:55,34 --> 0:23:55,34
