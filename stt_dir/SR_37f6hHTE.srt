USSR, it's Russian

Second--


202

connections with the KGB, and

have connections.

0:9:53,84 --> 0:9:55,86
It's all under one roof.

And that's what makes Russia an
entirely different country.


206

a night of good, clean vodka


210
0:10:10,91 --> 0:10:15,54
fun, it's good to get naked and
beaten with branches, even


211
0:10:15,54 --> 0:10:16,79
if it's by a dude.


212
0:10:16,79 --> 0:10:19,41



213
0:10:19,41 --> 0:10:20,66
[SHOUTING]


214
0:10:20,66 --> 0:10:23,83



215
0:10:23,83 --> 0:10:27,72
IVAR BERGLIN: Gives you time to
really think about stuff.


216
0:10:27,72 --> 0:10:30,37
If cleared my mind and reminded
me that even though


217
0:10:30,37 --> 0:10:33,99
Oleg's Russia is kind of
ominous, it actually was


218
0:10:33,99 --> 0:10:35,9
Poland the that the
first shot in the


219
0:10:35,9 --> 0:10:37,59
world's first Vodka War.


220
0:10:37,59 --> 0:10:42,38



221
0:10:42,38 --> 0:10:46,7
In the fall of 1977, a trade
war took place between USSR


222
0:10:46,7 --> 0:10:48,1
and Poland.


223
0:10:48,1 --> 0:10:50,52
Known as the Vodka War, it
saw Poland claim in the


224
0:10:50,52 --> 0:10:54,7
International Trade Court that
vodka first came from Poland.


225
0:10:54,7 --> 0:10:57,65
As such, only they had the right
to call their product


226
0:10:57,65 --> 0:11:1,19
vodka, and all others, including
the USSR, had to be


227
0:11:1,19 --> 0:11:3,23
labeled bread wine.


228
0:11:3,23 --> 0:11:5,37
At first, the Soviets dismissed


229
0:11:5,37 --> 0:11:6,79
Poland's claims as a joke.


230
0:11:6,79 --> 0:11:10,5
But when they realized their
small neighbor was serious,


231
0:11:10,5 --> 0:11:13,36
they ask well-known historian
and Soviet patriot William


232
0:11:13,36 --> 0:11:15,78
Pokhlebkin to investigate.


233
0:11:15,78 --> 0:11:18,75
This dude claimed that vodka was
first instilled in Moscow


234
0:11:18,75 --> 0:11:23,16
in 1440, decades before it
apparently appeared in Poland.


235
0:11:23,16 --> 0:11:25,46
Based on his research,
the court ruled


236
0:11:25,46 --> 0:11:27,14
in the USSR's favor.


237
0:11:27,14 --> 0:11:30,4
Poland lost the first
Vodka War.


238
0:11:30,4 --> 0:11:33,72
Recently, many academics have
disputed Pokhlebkin's work and


239
0:11:33,72 --> 0:11:36,3
this date, 1440.


240
0:11:36,3 --> 0:11:40,33
Pokhlebkin died in 2000, but we
managed to find his friend


241
0:11:40,33 --> 0:11:41,82
and publisher in Moscow.


242
0:11:41,82 --> 0:11:44,595
We wanted to know more about
the man that wrote the book


243
0:11:44,595 --> 0:11:47,64
that squashed Poland's
vodka ambitions.


244

0:11:48,99 --> 0:11:54,66



246
0:11:54,66 --> 0:11:54,9
IVAR BERGLIN: Pokhlebkin?


247
0:11:54,9 --> 0:11:55,44
BORIS PASTERNAK: Pokhlebkin.

0:11:55,44 --> 0:11:56,69

249
0:11:56,69 --> 0:12:24,75



250
0:12:24,75 --> 0:12:26,36
IVAR BERGLIN: Was the book
"The History of Vodka"


251
0:12:26,36 --> 0:12:28,46
well-received here in Russia?


252
0:12:28,46 --> 0:12:29,71
BORIS PASTERNAK:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


253
0:12:29,71 --> 0:12:43,3



254
0:12:43,3 --> 0:12:45,48
IVAR BERGLIN: Pokhlebkin's
book can't be trusted.


255
0:12:45,48 --> 0:12:48,62
In fact, one academic was
particularly blunt.


256
0:12:48,62 --> 0:12:51,61
"If you read this book, keep a
strong bottle of vodka by your


257
0:12:51,61 --> 0:12:53,89
side to stun the more thoughtful
parts of your


258
0:12:53,89 --> 0:12:57,9
brain." So we went looking for
some evidence of our own.


259
0:12:57,9 --> 0:13:4,28



260
0:13:4,28 --> 0:13:8,5
We went to Oxford, England to
find out something that we


261
0:13:8,5 --> 0:13:10,47
thought would be
crystal clear--


262
0:13:10,47 --> 0:13:13,39
the origins of the
word "vodka."


263
0:13:13,39 --> 0:13:16,27
NINA KRUGLIKOVA: The origin of
the book "vodka" is not as


264
0:13:16,27 --> 0:13:18,91
crystal clear as it may
seem at first sight.


265
0:13:18,91 --> 0:13:23,19
Most Russian speakers would
consider it to be a word of


266
0:13:23,19 --> 0:13:24,55
purely Russian origin.


267
0:13:24,55 --> 0:13:28,97
And even the first etymological
dictionaries of


268
0:13:28,97 --> 0:13:32,62
the Russian language did
not include this word.


269
0:13:32,62 --> 0:13:37,22
Some Slavonic scholars think
that its origin can be traced


270
0:13:37,22 --> 0:13:41,21
to the Polish language, to
the Polish word "wodka."


271
0:13:41,21 --> 0:13:42,72
IVAR BERGLIN: Most dictionaries
have the word


272
0:13:42,72 --> 0:13:48,87
"vodka" spelled with a V. And
the Poles have it spelled with


273
0:13:48,87 --> 0:13:52,762
a W. How come the West
excepted the V


274
0:13:52,762 --> 0:13:55,142
as its common spelling?


275
0:13:55,142 --> 0:13:58,91



276
0:13:58,91 --> 0:14:0,5
NINA KRUGLIKOVA: I'm not sure
about this question.


277
0:14:0,5 --> 0:14:5,58
But it might get back
to that particular


278
0:14:5,58 --> 0:14:8,81
case in 1972, I think.


279
0:14:8,81 --> 0:14:11,75
No, 1982--


280
0:14:11,75 --> 0:14:17,66
the year [INAUDIBLE] was given a
priority to produce vodka as


281
0:14:17,66 --> 0:14:21,78
the Russian original alcoholic
drink and has exclusive rights


282
0:14:21,78 --> 0:14:25,92
on its advertising under this
label in the international


283
0:14:25,92 --> 0:14:28,68
market, as the book says.


284
0:14:28,68 --> 0:14:29,93
IVAR BERGLIN: Is that right?


285
0:14:29,93 --> 0:14:38,13



286
0:14:38,13 --> 0:14:40,31
NINA KRUGLIKOVA: It depends
on what you mean by right.


287
0:14:40,31 --> 0:14:42,6
IVAR BERGLIN: Do you think that
vodka might be Polish?


288
0:14:42,6 --> 0:14:45,17
NINA KRUGLIKOVA: I think
that there is great


289
0:14:45,17 --> 0:14:46,73
likelihood of this.


290
0:14:46,73 --> 0:14:49,52
IVAR BERGLIN: So I went all the
way to Oxford just to end


291
0:14:49,52 --> 0:14:51,9
up right back with Pokhlebkin's
book, "The


292
0:14:51,9 --> 0:14:55,73
History of Vodka." Bummer.


293
0:14:55,73 --> 0:14:58,98
If Pokhlebkin's book isn't to
be trusted, why didn't the


294
0:14:58,98 --> 0:15:1,3
Poles fight back with some
evidence of their own?


295
0:15:1,3 --> 0:17:1,3
