###1 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: What is it like to have your life uprooted by a natural disaster?
###4 Today, we are sharing the story of one young victim and his family. I`m Carl Azuz, this
###9 is CNN STUDENT NEWS.
###24 We start with a search for hundreds of missing people. They haven`t been seen since the typhoon
###28 hit their home country last week. Typhoons are the same kinds of storms as hurricanes,
###34 and Typhoon Bopha was the strongest one that hit the Philippines this year. You can see
###38 some of the damage that it left behind in this "I-Report" video. The storm`s heavy rains
###43 led the flash floods and landslides, more than 600 people were killed in this, and almost
###48 1500 others were injured. More than 700 people are missing including more than 300 Filipino
###55 fishermen. Search efforts are underway, relief groups are trying to get supplies to some
###59 of the areas that were hit the worst, but it`s difficult, because of damage to roads
###63 and communication lines.
###65 Next, we are looking at the civil war in Syria. It`s been going on for almost two years now
###71 with Syrian government forces fighting against rebel groups. And official who`s represented
###76 the United Nations in the Arab League says the solution is possible, but he also described
###81 the situation in Syria as bad and getting worse. Some of the violence is happening in
###86 the city of Aleppo. And this Youtube video shows the fire in the city`s old market earlier
###91 this year. The old section of Aleppo is a world heritage site, it`s full of historical
###96 and cultural significance. Arwa Damon explores how it`s been effected by the civil war.
###101 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###102 ARWA DAMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Aleppo`s old city has not seen such devastation since occupied
###108 by the Mongol invaders eight centuries ago.
###112 This mosque, for example, dates back to 1315. This is Syria`s rich cultural heritage, and
###120 now everywhere we look, it`s been scarred by war. Once bustling winding streets, now
###127 a maze of ever shifting front lines.
###129 Overhead, the thundering of fighter jets, a small khan, lodging for caravans down the
###139 ages, lies in ruins. For more than three millennia, Aleppo has been a crossroads for traders.
###147 We hurry through the courtyard of a traditional home.
###155 Sheets are strung across streets to block snipers line of sight. Those who dare venture
###163 quickly across. A unit of fighters records people`s names and license plates, only those
###169 who have shops here are allowed through.
###172 Abu Bashir says, they`re trying to clamp down on robberies.
###178 (woman talking Arabic)
###179 DAMON: She shows us the list, the highlighted names have cleared out all their possessions.
###186 In one market, a shop recently hit by army fire, still smolders. The heart of old Aleppo,
###193 now the historic battleground for the very uncertain future of Syria.
###198 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###199 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###200 REP. JERROLD NADLER, NEW YORK: Although the emergency response agencies work hard to get
###205 the city back up and running, there were gaps in the recovery operations and there are many
###209 challenges that remain, particularly for a dense urban area like New York. Our transportation
###214 system is too vulnerable, our infrastructure is old and hard to replace. The power grid
###219 runs more than just lights and computers, it also powers heat and hot water and all
###223 water in the high-rises all over the city. And that operates the elevators that the elderly
###228 and disabled rely upon to escape their homes when they become unsafe.
###232 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###235 AZUZ: President Obama is asking Congress for more than $60 billion to help the states that
###241 have been effected by Superstorm Sandy. Now, that money is not going to cover all of the
###245 estimated damage from the storm, it would be used for recovery and the prepare for future
###250 natural disasters. Ryan Panetta and his family are going through that recovery process right
###255 now. Every day Ryan gets up and goes to school, after classes he rides the bus to his house,
###260 and all that sounds normal, but for Ryan and his family, life is nothing like it was before
###265 the storm.
###266 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###266 POPPY HARLOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The sun isn`t up at breakfast time for the Panettas.
###270 (on camera): How tired are you?
###274 RYAN PANETTA, 8TH GRADER, SCHOLARS ACADEMY: Very.
###274 HARLOW (voice over): Tim, Ryan, Christian and Carly are now living in a borrowed one-bedroom
###277 apartment with their parents.

###283 HARLOW: And what did it use to be?
###287 RYAN PANETTA: 15 minutes.
###288 HARLOW: Wow.
###289 (voice over): 6:30 a.m and they are out the door. A long car ride ...

###296 HARLOW: Then a bus to Ryan`s temporary school, PS-13.
###300 KAREN PANETTA: It`s unreal how much our life has changed. You know, and we are trying to
###305 make the best of it.
###305 HARLOW: He is an 8th grade honor student, one of 5400 New York students still in different
###311 schools because of Sandy.
###312 CARRIE JAMES, SCHOLAR`S ACADEMY HUMANITIES TEACHER: He is the one that I think was probably
###314 impacted the most, and yet he has the strongest will to be here every day.
###319 RYAN PANETTA: When something brings you down, you`ve got to get up.
###323 HARLOW (on camera): You are OK, buddy?
###327 What makes you sad?
###329 RYAN PANETTA: I honestly don`t know.
###332 HARLOW: Everything?
###333 RYAN PANETTA: It`s everything.
###336 KAREN PANETTA: How did it go today, Ryan?
###340 RYAN PANETTA: Good.
###342 HARLOW (VOICE OVER): Every day after school Ryan returns to Broad Channel to help his
###349 dad try to put their home back together.
###351 JOE PANETTA, RYAN`S FATHER: Everything that I owned, everything I worked hard for everything
###355 was there, and it`s gone, it`s nothing.
###357 HARLOW: Joe was working overnights, and Karen was home with their four children when Sandy
###361 hit.
###362 KAREN PANETTA: It was unbelievable, though, how quickly it came in.
###364 HARLOW: The water rushed into their one-story house, Ryan swam to neighbor for help.
###369 RYAN PANETTA: I jumped out.
###370 HARLOW (on camera): You jumped out here in the water?
###372 RYAN PANETTA: Yes. I wasn`t even thinking that like a log would hit me or anything.
###375 HARLOW: Or the electrical power lines?
###376 RYAN PANETTA: Yes.
###377 HARLOW: You swam to this house?
###378 RYAN PANETTA: Yeah, it`s right here. And they took us in to the second floor.
###382 HARLOW (voice over): The neighbor helped bring the rest of the family over, and they watched
###386 as the water engulfed the only home they`ve known.
###388 (on camera): What did you think when your 13-old son jumped in the water?
###392 KAREN PANETTA: You know, I was panicking. I was panicking.
###395 HARLOW: Did Ryan helped save your family?
###397 KAREN PANETTA: Absolutely.
###398 HARLOW: No question?
###398 KAREN PANETTA: Absolutely.
###399 HARLOW (voice over): Now, all the Panettas are working to rebuild their home and erase
###404 the bad memories.
###405 RYAN PANETTA: After what I`ve just been through like I don`t hope I have to see anything that
###411 terrifying again.

###417 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See, if you can I.D. me.
###421 I`m a planet in our Solar System. I`m not one of the gas giants, but I am the largest
###427 of the terrestrial or rocky planets. I`m the only planet whose name doesn`t come from Greek
###432 or Roman mythology.
###435 I`m Earth, the fifth largest planet in the Solar System.
###442 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###444 AZUZ: You`ve seen a lot of pictures of the Earth, most of the time they are taken during
###448 the day because we have a lot of satellites that can do that for us. There is a new sensor
###452 on a satellite that was launched last year, that`s especially designed to observe the
###456 Earth at night. Scientists say these cloud free images are from more detailed view of
###461 our planet than ever before. What`s really interesting are the lights, and how they sort
###467 of define our world. For example, this is Egypt, and that long line is the Nile River,
###472 the satellite can distinguish the brightly lit boats traveling along it. Some of the
###476 lights around the Arabian Peninsula are gas flares from oil exploration, and this border
###481 between light and dark is marked by the Himalayan Mountains, an example of how natural borders
###485 can effect human settlement. You can see political borders, too. The lights here in South Korea,
###491 the darkness is North Korea.
###493 There are some new officers on patrol in metro stations around Washington, and they come
###497 equipped with a unique skill set: it all starts with their noses, these bomb-sniffing dogs
###503 worked with the Marine Corps in Afghanistan. They were recently donated to the Metro Transit
###508 Police. Their new handlers are impressed by their pedigree.
###511 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###511 SGT. ANDY KEAHON, METRO TRANSIT POLICE DEPARTMENT: Every single one of the nine dogs that we
###515 receive from the Marine Corps found bombs in Afghanistan. We have one in particular
###518 that found 37 improvised explosive devises that were all buried down the road. We had
###523 no idea that these dogs where as good they are, and they are fantastic.
###526 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###527 AZUZ: And good looking, too. Now, we did a dog story. So, before we go, in order to be
###531 fair we are going to finish up with felines. This little guy is down for a catnap. But
###535 something seems to have spooked him, look at those poor paws, flailing. Leave it to
###540 mom to know just what to do: you brush down the arms and come in for a quick kitty cuddle.
###546 A classic move seems to do the trick, and now you know the secret. If your pet is suffering
###551 from nightmares, a simple hug will take care of the whole kitten caboodle. Without any
###556 fears of further catastrophe. CNN STUDENT NEWS returns tomorrow. I hope to see you then,
###560 bye-bye.
