###11 DAVID CHOE: I'd spent the early part of my childhood
###13 traveling a lot.
###14 Train hopping, hitch hiking, doing all these things.
###17 The sense of adventure, the sense of wonder, I don't know.
###21 I guess it's real childish, but I wanted to see and go
###24 places where no one's been before.
###26 I've been reading about this dinosaur in "National
###28 Geographic" and online.
###29 And I didn't give a shit.
###31 I just wanted to go to this crazy place and see what I can
###34 find, you know?
###35 The Congo is the heart of darkness.
###37 There's an area of thick, dense, untouched rainforest
###39 about the size of Florida.
###40 It's the only area that survived the last ice age, and
###44 it's the lastly place on Earth believed to have living,
###45 breathing dinosaurs .
###46 The one the locals talk about the most is
###48 [FOREIGN LANGUAGE].
###49 In Pygmy language, it means one who
###51 stops the flow of rivers.
###52 And it's fucking huge.
###53 It's supposed to be several times bigger than an elephant.
###56 Scientific expeditions come out every couple of years from
###58 all over the world.
###59 The British army saw glimpses of it. "National Geographic"
###63 found something.
###64 The consensus is that it lives deep in the rainforest near a
###67 lake called Lake Tele, so that's where we went.
###70 And it was a hell of a ride.
###71 
###88 We're in Brazzaville, Congo today.
###91 I haven't been here for 10 years.
###93 I've been with my group, Roch and Stephane for three days
###99 now, and there's a growing dissent within our group.
###101 Other people in the group want to, like, pursue other
###103 stories, like, I guess albinos are treated as gods out here.
###107 Another guy in our group is obsessed with trying to get
###109 Pygmy porn.
###110 This is not what we came here for.
###111 We came here for the fucking dinosaur.
###113 We've talked to experts.
###114 We've talked to scientists.
###115 We've talked to local sorcerers, and everyone's seen
###118 this fucking thing.
###119 
###124 JOSEPH HARVEY: What I know is that before we came, first in
###126 1992, I grew up with family friends who were
###131 missionaries here.
###132 Gene Thomas and his wife, Sandy, who was a nurse, they
###135 were going through this area where the river became a
###139 little bit wider.
###140 It was almost like a pond, or a lake.
###142 And he saw this huge thing raise up out of
###146 the water, and he--
###151 it sounds so dumb, because this is
###152 what happens to everybody.
###154 He went to get his camera, and he couldn't get it in time,
###157 and it submerged.
###158 
###169 MARK BIEDLINGMAIER: I ask you just to be very open mind in
###172 your travels.
###173 It isn't the United States.
###174 It's not New York.
###176 It isn't Washington, DC.
###178 Infrastructure is very challenging.
###180 DAVID CHOE: Right.
###180 MARK BIEDLINGMAIER: I don't know if they told you, but
###182 where you're going has very, very limited
###184 electricity, water.
###185 DAVID CHOE: Has basically nothing.
###187 MARK BIEDLINGMAIER: Exactly.
###187 DAVID CHOE: And every animal and poisonous insect, and
###191 every disease we can imagine.
###192 MARK BIEDLINGMAIER: So consider yourself sort of on
###194 the wilderness, and on the frontier of Africa.
###197 But I wholeheartedly support your venture here, and I wish
###201 you the best of success.
###202 DAVID CHOE: Thank you.
###203 MARK BIEDLINGMAIER: Thank you very much.
###203 DAVID CHOE: Nice meeting you.
###204 MARK BIEDLINGMAIER: Super.
###205 DAVID CHOE: We've got our team together, our Pygmy force to
###208 take us into the jungle.
###211 We've got our guide here.
###212 He's got a nice Photoshop shirt of the
###216 dinosaur with the president.
###218 He's sort of like the Charles Grodin, Philip Seymour Hoffman
###222 guy of the group.
###223 Over here we have a Ben Kingsley, sexy beast guy of
###228 the group, and then over here we have the Richard Grieco,
###231 Terrence Howard, Benicio Del Toro guy of the group.
###234 And this is our force to go into the jungle.
###237 
###248 We were wandering in the jungle for a while.
###250 It was dark and light, and disorientating.
###253 We got lost a couple times, and even
###255 with the Pygmy guides.
###256 
###262 We would have been dead without them.
###263 Like, there were some areas that we can't even get
###265 through, because we're so tall, and they're the only
###268 ones-- them and children are the only ones, midgets are the
###270 only ones that could get through there.
###272 
###295 My team looks like they're about to die.
###299 We're sweating like dogs.
###301 I've noticed the Pygmies, they don't sweat
###304 and they don't fart.
###305 I think they don't fart because they
###307 don't eat any food.
###308 
###315 So once we got to the village, the chief and his henchmen,
###318 they kept asking us what we wanted to do
###320 while we were there.
###322 Did we want to go to the waterfalls?
###323 Did we want to go shoot pigs?
###325 We just said we wanted to see the dinosaur.
###327 And then they kept saying, do you want to see the dinosaur?
###329 Do you want to see this dinosaur?
###331 Yes, we want to see the dinosaur.
###333 Do you really want to see this dinosaur?
###334 Yeah, we want to see this dinosaur.
###336 So we had to do this ritual, and this ritual involved lots
###341 and lots of alcohol.
###342 
###347 DAVID CHOE: So they pour us this clear liquid.
###349 It tastes like gasoline, and I guess it's made from
###352 [INAUDIBLE] husks, and I don't know what else.
###356 Tastes like fucking acid.
###359 
###365 It put me on my ass right away.
###368 I feel really crazy right now, huh?
###370 
###373 During all this, looking over at Ben, he was doing this
###375 weird thing with branches, and I was like, fuck, man.
###377 Is he like, reading my mind right now?
###380 Does he know what a fucking scumbag I am?
###381 He was giving me this weird look, like he knew me.
###384 
###390 That's a skinny dog.
###392 
###394 [DRUM MUSIC]
###406 I don't know what was in that stuff.
###408 They did not stop.
###410 Not to take a break, not to eat, and they just keep going,
###413 and they just keep going.
###414 And then, like, some kind of dream or something.
###416 This thing just came out, and the people just screamed.
###419 And it was, you know, obviously it was a dude
###421 dressed up like something.
###423 He had all these leaves, and, you know, they were either
###426 saying he's an evil spirit, or it's the dinosaur.
###428 And I'm like, oh, I guess that's the dinosaur.
###430 And as fucked up as I was, you know, I was
###433 believing it at the time.
###434 It felt like there was a hole in my stomach.
###436 I kept staring at my feet.
###438 I thought my face was eating at my own face.
###440 And I thought of eating my own feet.
###442 I thought I was fucked, and I knew I was
###443 fucked while I was fucked.
###445 Laying there, going, shit.
###446 This is going to be really bad.
###448 
###460 [FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###464 DAVID CHOE: I didn't come all this way to see a guy dance
###467 around in a dinosaur costume and participate in fucked up
###470 rituals for the chance of maybe catching a blurry shot
###474 of a fuzzy dinosaur head.
###476 We didn't even get close to the beginning point of where
###478 the dinosaur was.
###479 
###499 I think we're in Lake Tele, but I don't know.
###502 It's been so long since I've eaten anything, or showered,
###508 or anyone's spoken any word of English.
###512 You have to really be careful when you're in the jungle.
###514 You have to always, like, cloud your thoughts, because
###517 you never know where there's going to be a sorcerer, "Harry
###519 Potter" type Pygmy ready to psionically mind fuck you.
###523 So I don't know.
###526 Who knows?
###526 We might have come back.
###528 We'll see.
###529
