1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:8,49



2
0:0:8,49 --> 0:0:10,46
ERICA HILL: Two more Americans
dead as a result of the


3
0:0:10,46 --> 0:0:11,78
violence in Mexico.


4
0:0:11,78 --> 0:0:15,52
Those victims gunned down this
week by drug cartel killers.


5
0:0:15,52 --> 0:0:17,59
MALE REPORTER: We've done a lot
of stories about polygamy


6
0:0:17,59 --> 0:0:20,61
and a lot of stories about
Mexican drug cartel violence.


7
0:0:20,61 --> 0:0:23,59
But we never imagined the two
topics would mesh like this in


8
0:0:23,59 --> 0:0:25,8
a very tragic way.


9
0:0:25,8 --> 0:0:28,61



10
0:0:28,61 --> 0:0:30,63
SHANE SMITH: The freeing of
one of their own, by the


11
0:0:30,63 --> 0:0:33,61
LeBarons protesting in
Chihuahua, had sent a message


12
0:0:33,61 --> 0:0:34,77
to the narcos.


13
0:0:34,77 --> 0:0:36,2
They weren't going
to back down.


14
0:0:36,2 --> 0:0:37,28
They weren't going to submit.


15
0:0:37,28 --> 0:0:38,38
They were going to fight.


16
0:0:38,38 --> 0:0:40,3
But it didn't take El
Rikin long to send a


17
0:0:40,3 --> 0:0:41,55
message right back.


18
0:0:41,55 --> 0:0:48,48



19
0:0:48,48 --> 0:0:50,69
BRENT LEBARON: Yeah, this is
my cousin Benjamin's home.


20
0:0:50,69 --> 0:0:51,65
SHANE SMITH: Right.


21
0:0:51,65 --> 0:0:55,15
BRENT LEBARON: This Rikin guy
actually ordered the hit on


22
0:0:55,15 --> 0:0:57,49
him because of a
stand he took.


23
0:0:57,49 --> 0:0:59,44
SHANE SMITH: He was a
serious criminal.


24
0:0:59,44 --> 0:1:2,68
I mean, famously he got caught
on the American side of the


25
0:1:2,68 --> 0:1:6,11
border dressed as Mexican
military, had a shootout with


26
0:1:6,11 --> 0:1:8,8
the border guards, and
then came back here.


27
0:1:8,8 --> 0:1:10,45
BRENT LEBARON: Yeah.


28
0:1:10,45 --> 0:1:12,22
SHANE SMITH: So they came
here to his house?


29
0:1:12,22 --> 0:1:13,47
BRENT LEBARON: Yeah.


30
0:1:13,47 --> 0:1:18,17



31
0:1:18,17 --> 0:1:23,14
He showed up with 15, 20 guys,
two, three trucks, pickups.


32
0:1:23,14 --> 0:1:25,66
Benjamin and his family were
sleeping in the house when


33
0:1:25,66 --> 0:1:28,59
these guys come, surround the
house, breaking down his door,


34
0:1:28,59 --> 0:1:31,65
ended up breaking pretty much
most of his windows out.


35
0:1:31,65 --> 0:1:34,88
There's still marks on the door
where they're trying to


36
0:1:34,88 --> 0:1:37,77
bash in with guns, whatever
they had.


37
0:1:37,77 --> 0:1:39,57
Those are sledgehammer marks.


38
0:1:39,57 --> 0:1:42,23
At that point, they had
threatened his family with a


39
0:1:42,23 --> 0:1:42,97
hand grenade.


40
0:1:42,97 --> 0:1:44,242
SHANE SMITH: So they said they'd
blow up the family with


41
0:1:44,242 --> 0:1:45,68
a grenade unless
he surrendered?


42
0:1:45,68 --> 0:1:46,96
BRENT LEBARON: Unless
he opened the door.


43
0:1:46,96 --> 0:1:48,46
And so he opened the door.


44
0:1:48,46 --> 0:1:51,7
At that point, his
brother-in-law, Luis, came


45
0:1:51,7 --> 0:1:52,56
over to see what was going on.


46
0:1:52,56 --> 0:1:54,34
He literally showed
up in sandals.


47
0:1:54,34 --> 0:1:55,27
He came to the rescue.


48
0:1:55,27 --> 0:1:56,59
He was an innocent bystander.


49
0:1:56,59 --> 0:1:59,91
SHANE SMITH: So he came here
barefoot with no gun--


50
0:1:59,91 --> 0:2:0,26
BRENT LEBARON: At all.


51
0:2:0,26 --> 0:2:1,82
SHANE SMITH: --against guys
who are armed with machine


52
0:2:1,82 --> 0:2:2,21
guns and grenades?


53
0:2:2,21 --> 0:2:2,78
BRENT LEBARON: Yes.


54
0:2:2,78 --> 0:2:9,139
But they beat him and picked him
and Benjamin up, and took


55
0:2:9,139 --> 0:2:12,9
them about 2 miles down the road
here, and shot them both,


56
0:2:12,9 --> 0:2:14,703
and left them on the
side of the road.


57
0:2:14,703 --> 0:2:17,98
SHANE SMITH: So because El
Rikin put the hit out on


58
0:2:17,98 --> 0:2:21,79
Benjamin, it put enough domestic
pressure here that


59
0:2:21,79 --> 0:2:24,51
they would offer him up to the
American authorities for the


60
0:2:24,51 --> 0:2:26,65
Mexican incident where he was
dressed as the military with


61
0:2:26,65 --> 0:2:27,44
the border police?


62
0:2:27,44 --> 0:2:29,64
BRENT LEBARON: Very much
so, very much so, yeah.


63
0:2:29,64 --> 0:2:32,43
Because I don't think they had
enough here to hold him here.


64
0:2:32,43 --> 0:2:34,79
So they actually shipped
him to the US.


65
0:2:34,79 --> 0:2:36,64
SHANE SMITH: And although El
Rikin was extradited to


66
0:2:36,64 --> 0:2:39,79
America for his firefights with
the border patrol, none


67
0:2:39,79 --> 0:2:42,14
of the other 20-plus men
involved in this double


68
0:2:42,14 --> 0:2:43,97
homicide have ever
been convicted.


69
0:2:43,97 --> 0:2:49,2



70
0:2:49,2 --> 0:2:51,48
But the LeBarons
wouldn't quit.


71
0:2:51,48 --> 0:2:55,9
In fact, Julian LeBaron,
Benjamin's brother, has since


72
0:2:55,9 --> 0:2:57,42
taken up his dead sibling's
mantle of activism.


73
0:2:57,42 --> 0:3:0,13



74
0:3:0,13 --> 0:3:4,25
JULIAN LEBARON: The main thing
is we want to be respected.


75
0:3:4,25 --> 0:3:5,91
In Mexico, nobody's respected.


76
0:3:5,91 --> 0:3:7,72
We're not respected by the
criminals, and we're not


77
0:3:7,72 --> 0:3:8,97
respected by the government.


78
0:3:8,97 --> 0:3:14,885



79
0:3:14,885 --> 0:3:16,82
This is for messing
with [INAUDIBLE]


80
0:3:16,82 --> 0:3:18,23
people or some stupid shit.


81
0:3:18,23 --> 0:3:19,75
I don't remember what it was.


82
0:3:19,75 --> 0:3:21,635
And that's where they
found them.


83
0:3:21,635 --> 0:3:23,54
They shot them four times
in the head each.


84
0:3:23,54 --> 0:3:24,56
SHANE SMITH: Shit.


85
0:3:24,56 --> 0:3:26,45
JULIAN LEBARON: I think that
most of us felt really


86
0:3:26,45 --> 0:3:30,15
thankful that we found them,
because sometimes they'll take


87
0:3:30,15 --> 0:3:32,51
them and torture
them to death.


88
0:3:32,51 --> 0:3:35,11
People from our neighboring
communities participated in


89
0:3:35,11 --> 0:3:36,36
this murder.


90
0:3:36,36 --> 0:3:42,94



91
0:3:42,94 --> 0:3:45,33
Those are some of the
people that are


92
0:3:45,33 --> 0:3:46,432
involved with this shit.


93
0:3:46,432 --> 0:3:46,81
SHANE SMITH: Really?


94
0:3:46,81 --> 0:3:48,24
Those guys are bad boys?


95
0:3:48,24 --> 0:3:55,803



96
0:3:55,803 --> 0:3:56,55
SHANE SMITH: Jesus Christ.


97
0:3:56,55 --> 0:3:57,846
I thought you guys
were friends.


98
0:3:57,846 --> 0:4:0,792



99
0:4:0,792 --> 0:4:3,37
JULIAN LEBARON: 10 children
under the age of seven were


100
0:4:3,37 --> 0:4:7,79
left orphans when that
happened that night.


101
0:4:7,79 --> 0:4:10,87
My brother and his
brother-in-law, they were some


102
0:4:10,87 --> 0:4:12,92
of the most valuable people
in our community.


103
0:4:12,92 --> 0:4:15,49
This can never acceptable,
never.


104
0:4:15,49 --> 0:4:19,589
Because if this is acceptable,
there's no future left.


105
0:4:19,589 --> 0:4:22,66
The community, initially, what
we said is, for every person


106
0:4:22,66 --> 0:4:25,23
they kill from our community,
we'll kill 10 of them, because


107
0:4:25,23 --> 0:4:26,31
we know who they are.


108
0:4:26,31 --> 0:4:29,212
And then we said, well, that's
not a solution because then


109
0:4:29,212 --> 0:4:30,462
you become just like them.


110
0:4:30,462 --> 0:4:35,8



111
0:4:35,8 --> 0:4:36,56
SHANE SMITH: So the sun
was going down.


112
0:4:36,56 --> 0:4:37,75
It was getting a little
bit late.


113
0:4:37,75 --> 0:4:39,65
And the LeBarons told us that
we should get back to our


114
0:4:39,65 --> 0:4:41,93
hotel before it got dark.


115
0:4:41,93 --> 0:4:44,9
We are going to a hotel that's
actually in the LeBaron


116
0:4:44,9 --> 0:4:47,18
colony, which hopefully will
a little bit safer.


117
0:4:47,18 --> 0:4:49,31
But after you hear stories
like that, you just can't


118
0:4:49,31 --> 0:4:52,99
believe the fear of violence
that these people


119
0:4:52,99 --> 0:4:54,72
live under every day.


120
0:4:54,72 --> 0:4:56,86
It makes you paranoid to
hear stories like that.


121
0:4:56,86 --> 0:5:0,27
So we're going to go to our
hotel and lock ourselves in.


122
0:5:0,27 --> 0:5:3,9



123
0:5:3,9 --> 0:5:6,36
MALE SPEAKER 2: When it came
to them now kidnapping our


124
0:5:6,36 --> 0:5:9,49
family members, that what
we took a stand against.


125
0:5:9,49 --> 0:5:10,15
MALE SPEAKER 3: We have illegal


126
0:5:10,15 --> 0:5:11,69
weapons in our community.


127
0:5:11,69 --> 0:5:13,125
Come in and find them
if you want.


128
0:5:13,125 --> 0:5:15,15
MALE SPEAKER 4: When it comes
to protecting our family, if


129
0:5:15,15 --> 0:5:16,9
we have to die doing
it, we're going to.


130
0:5:16,9 --> 0:7:16,9
