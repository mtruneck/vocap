###0 JIM LEHRER: Good evening from the Magness Arena at the University of Denver in Denver,
###5 Colorado. I'm Jim Lehrer of the PBS NewsHour, and I welcome you to the first of the 2012
###12 presidential debates between President Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee, and former
###17 Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee.
###22 This debate and the next three — two presidential, one vice- presidential — are sponsored by
###27 the Commission on Presidential Debates.
###31 Tonight's 90 minutes will be about domestic issues, and will follow a format designed
###37 by the commission. There will be six roughly 15-minute segments, with two-minute answers
###43 for the first question, then open discussion for the remainder of each segment.
###49 Thousands of people offered suggestions on segment subjects of questions via the Internet
###55 and other means, but I made the final selections, and for the record, they were not submitted
###61 for approval to the commission or the candidates.
###64 The segments, as I announced in advance, will be three on the economy and one each on health
###72 care, the role of government, and governing, with an emphasis throughout on differences,
###80 specifics and choices. Both candidates will also have two-minute closing statements.
###86 The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, applause, boos,
###92 hisses — among other noisy distracting things — so we may all concentrate on what the
###99 candidates have to say. There is a noise exception right now, though, as we welcome President
###106 Obama and Governor Romney. (Cheers, applause.)
###131 Gentlemen, welcome to you both.
###140 Let's start the economy, segment one. And let's begin with jobs. What are the major
###148 differences between the two of you about how you would go about creating new jobs? You
###157 have two minutes — each of you have two minutes to start. The coin toss has determined,
###161 Mr. President, you go first.
###161 PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well, thank you very much, Jim, for this opportunity. I want to
###165 thank Governor Romney and the University of Denver for your hospitality.
###169 There are a lot of points that I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that
###174 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry
###180 me. (Laughter.) And so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you
###186 know that a year from now, we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people.
###190 (Laughter.)
###191 You know, four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.
###198 Millions of jobs were lost. The auto industry was on the brink of collapse. The financial
###203 system had frozen up. And because of the resilience and the determination of the American people,
###210 we've begun to fight our way back.
###212 Over the last 30 months, we've seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created. The auto
###218 industry has come roaring back and housing has begun to rise. But we all know that we've
###225 still got a lot of work to do. And so the question here tonight is not where we've been
###229 but where we're going. Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed
###238 towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations that we'll be better off.
###243 I've got a different view. I think we've got to invest in education and training. I think
###247 it's important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America, that we change
###252 our tax code to make sure that we're helping small businesses and companies that are investing
###256 here in the United States, that we take some of the money that we're saving as we wind
###261 down two wars to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that
###267 allows us to make these critical investments.
###270 Now, it ultimately is going to be up to the voters, to you, which path we should take.
###275 Are we going to double down on the top-down economic policies that helped to get us into
###279 this mess, or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says, America does best when
###286 the middle class does best? And I'm looking forward to having that debate.
###289 MR. LEHRER: Governor Romney, two minutes.
###291 MR. ROMNEY: Thank you, Jim. It's an honor to be here with you, and I appreciate the
###294 chance to be with the president. I am pleased to be at the University of Denver, appreciate
###298 their welcome and also the presidential commission on these debates.
###302 And congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary. I'm sure this was the
###305 most romantic place you could imagine here — here with me, so I — (laughter) — congratulations.
###311 This is obviously a very tender topic. I've had the occasion over the last couple of years
###317 of meeting people across the country. I was in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm,
###322 and she said, I've been out of work since May. Can you help me?
###325 Ann yesterday was a rally in Denver, and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms
###331 and said, Ann, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs. He's lost
###336 his most recent job, and we've now just lost our home. Can you help us?
###341 And the answer is yes, we can help, but it's going to take a different path, not the one
###347 we've been on, not the one the president describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich. That's
###353 not what I'm going to do.
###354 My plan has five basic parts. One, get us energy independent, North American energy
###359 independent. That creates about four million jobs. Number two, open up more trade, particularly
###364 in Latin America; crack down on China if and when they cheat. Number three, make sure our
###369 people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world. We're far
###373 away from that now. Number four, get us to a balanced budget. Number five, champion small
###380 business.
###380 It's small business that creates the jobs in America. And over the last four years small-business
###386 people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business, because
###390 new business startups are down to a 30-year low. I know what it takes to get small business
###396 growing again, to hire people.
###397 Now, I'm concerned that the path that we're on has just been unsuccessful. The president
###402 has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years ago, that a bigger
###407 government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more — if you will, trickle-down government
###412 would work. That's not the right answer for America. I'll restore the vitality that gets
###417 America working again.
###419 Thank you.
###419 MR. LEHRER: Mr. President, please respond directly to what the governor just said about
###424 trickle-down — his trickle-down approach. He's — as he said yours is.
###429 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do.
###434 First, we've got to improve our education system. And we've made enormous progress drawing
###440 on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in
###446 some of the toughest-to- deal-with schools. We've got a program called Race to the Top
###450 that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving
###457 how we train teachers. So now I want to hire another hundred thousand new math and science
###461 teachers and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can
###467 get trained for the jobs that are out there right now. And I want to make sure that we
###471 keep tuition low for our young people.
###474 When it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate
###479 is too high. So I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent.
###486 But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are
###492 shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing
###496 here in the United States.
###498 On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that we've got to boost American energy
###503 production.
###504 And oil and natural gas production are higher than they've been in years. But I also believe
###511 that we've got to look at the energy source of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels,
###516 and make those investments.
###518 So, all of this is possible. Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit,
###522 and one of the things I'm sure we'll be discussing tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code,
###527 and how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also how
###531 do we have enough revenue to make those investments? And this is where there's a difference because
###535 Governor Romney's central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of the extension
###542 of the Bush tax cuts, so that's another $2 trillion, and $2 trillion in additional military
###547 spending that the military hasn't asked for. That's $8 trillion. How we pay for that, reduce
###553 the deficit and make the investments that we need to make without dumping those costs
###558 on the middle-class Americans I think is one of the central questions of this campaign.
###562 MR. LEHRER: Both of you have spoken about a lot of different things, and we're going
###566 to try to get through them in as specific a way as we possibly can.
###570 But first, Governor Romney, do you have a question that you'd like to ask the president
###574 directly about something he just said?
###576 MR. ROMNEY: Well, sure. I'd like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece.
###579 First of all, I don't have a $5 trillion tax cut. I don't have a tax cut of a scale that
###584 you're talking about. My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle
###588 class. But I'm not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high- income people. High-income
###593 people are doing just fine in this economy. They'll do fine whether you're president or
###596 I am.
###597 The people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans. Under the
###601 president's policies, middle-income Americans have been buried. They're — they're just
###605 being crushed. Middle-income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300. This
###612 is a — this is a tax in and of itself. I'll call it the economy tax. It's been crushing.
###618 The same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president, electric rates are up,
###622 food prices are up, health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family.
###628 Middle-income families are being crushed. And so the question is how to get them going
###631 again, and I've described it. It's energy and trade, the right kind of training programs,
###636 balancing our budget and helping small business. Those are the — the cornerstones of my plan.
###641 But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas, and I'll just note: first, education.
###645 I agree, education is key, particularly the future of our economy. But our training programs
###650 right now, we got 47 of them housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different
###655 agencies. Overhead is overwhelming. We got to get those dollars back to the states and
###660 go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to getting the training they
###663 need for jobs that will really help them.
###666 The second area: taxation. We agree; we ought to bring the tax rates down, and I do, both
###670 for corporations and for individuals. But in order for us not to lose revenue, have
###675 the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions so that
###680 we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth.
###683 The third area: energy. Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that
###689 production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up. But not due to his policies. In spite of his
###694 policies. Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private
###700 land, not on government land. On government land, your administration has cut the number
###705 of permits and license in half. If I'm president, I'll double them. And also get the — the
###712 oil from offshore and Alaska. And I'll bring that pipeline in from Canada.
###716 And by the way, I like coal. I'm going to make sure we continue to burn clean coal.
###721 People in the coal industry feel like it's getting crushed by your policies. I want to
###725 get America and North America energy independent, so we can create those jobs.
###730 And finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, I'm not looking to cut massive taxes
###735 and to reduce the — the revenues going to the government. My — my number one principle
###740 is there'll be no tax cut that adds to the deficit.
###742 I want to underline that — no tax cut that adds to the deficit. But I do want to reduce
###747 the burden being paid by middle-income Americans. And I — and to do that that also means that
###753 I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans. So any — any language to the
###758 contrary is simply not accurate.
###759 MR. LEHRER: Mr. President.
###760 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, I think — let's talk about taxes because I think it's instructive.
###766 Now, four years ago when I stood on this stage I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class
###773 families. And that's exactly what I did. We cut taxes for middle-class families by about
###779 $3,600. And the reason is because I believe we do best when the middle class is doing
###786 well.
###787 And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket and so
###793 maybe they can buy a new car. They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary
###799 recession that we went through. They can buy a computer for their kid who's going off to
###803 college, which means they're spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses
###807 make more profits and then hire more workers.
###809 Now, Governor Romney's proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5
###816 trillion tax cut on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military. And
###822 he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. The problem
###828 is that he's been asked a — over a hundred times how you would close those deductions
###833 and loopholes and he hasn't been able to identify them.
###836 But I'm going to make an important point here, Jim.
###838 MR. LEHRER: All right.
###838 PRESIDENT OBAMA: When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper income individuals
###845 can — are currently taking advantage of — if you take those all away — you don't
###848 come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military
###853 spending. And that's why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet
###859 Governor Romney's pledge of not reducing the deficit — or — or — or not adding to
###865 the deficit, is by burdening middle-class families.
###869 The average middle-class family with children would pay about $2,000 more. Now, that's not
###874 my analysis; that's the analysis of economists who have looked at this. And — and that
###878 kind of top — top-down economics, where folks at the top are doing well so the average
###883 person making 3 million bucks is getting a $250,000 tax break while middle- class families
###889 are burdened further, that's not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth.
###894 MR. LEHRER: All right. What is the difference?
###895 MR. ROMNEY: Well —
###895 MR. LEHRER: Let's just stay on taxes for —
###897 MR. ROMNEY: But I — but I — right, right.
###897 MR. LEHRER: OK. Yeah, just — let's just stay on taxes for a moment.
###900 MR. ROMNEY: Yeah. Well, but — but —
###900 MR. LEHRER: What is the difference?
###901 MR. ROMNEY: — virtually every — virtually everything he just said about my tax plan
###903 is inaccurate.
###904 MR. LEHRER: All right, go —
###904 MR. ROMNEY: So — so if — if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to
###909 support, I'd say absolutely not. I'm not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut. What I've said
###914 is I won't put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit. That's part one. So there's
###919 no economist can say Mitt Romney's tax plan adds 5 trillion (dollars) if I say I will
###923 not add to the deficit with my tax plan.
###926 Number two, I will not reduce the share paid by high-income individuals. I — I know that
###931 you and your running mate keep saying that, and I know it's a popular things to say with
###934 a lot of people, but it's just not the case. Look, I got five boys. I'm used to people
###939 saying something that's not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping
###943 I'll believe it — (scattered laughter) — but that — that is not the case, all right?
###946 I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans.
###951 And number three, I will not, under any circumstances, raise taxes on middle-income families. I will
###957 lower taxes on middle-income families. Now, you cite a study. There are six other studies
###961 that looked at the study you describe and say it's completely wrong. I saw a study that
###965 came out today that said you're going to raise taxes by 3(,000 dollars) to $4,000 on — on
###970 middle-income families. There are all these studies out there.
###973 But let's get to the bottom line. That is, I want to bring down rates. I want to bring
###977 down the rates down, at the same time lower deductions and exemptions and credits and
###981 so forth so we keep getting the revenue we need.
###984 And you think, well, then why lower the rates? And the reason is because small business pays
###990 that individual rate. Fifty-four percent of America's workers work in businesses that
###995 are taxed not at the corporate tax rate but at the individual tax rate. And if we lower
###1000 that rate, they will be able to hire more people.
###1004 For me, this is about jobs.
###1006 MR. LEHRER: All right. That's where we started.
###1006 MR. ROMNEY: This is about getting jobs for the American people.
###1008 MR. LEHRER: Yeah.
###1009 Do you challenge what the governor just said about his own plan?
###1013 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, for 18 months he's been running on this tax plan. And now, five
###1019 weeks before the election, he's saying that his big, bold idea is "never mind." And the
###1026 fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you describe, Governor, then it is
###1033 not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income
###1037 individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class. It's — it's
###1045 math. It's arithmetic.
###1047 Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth.
###1052 So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families,
###1060 I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times. And what I want to do is continue
###1068 the tax rates — the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families.
###1074 But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year that we should go back to the rates
###1081 that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went
###1085 from deficit to surplus and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot.
###1089 And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we can not only reduce the
###1093 deficit, we can not only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we're also able
###1099 to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy.
###1104 And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business.
###1108 Now, under — under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income
###1113 taxes go up. Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they're the job creators. They'd
###1119 be burdened.
###1120 But under Governor Romney's definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires
###1125 who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business. And I know Donald Trump
###1129 doesn't like to think of himself as small anything, but — but that's how you define
###1135 small businesses if you're getting business income. And that kind of approach, I believe,
###1141 will not grow our economy because the only way to pay for it without either burdening
###1146 the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education,
###1155 making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things
###1161 that are helping America grow. And I think that would be a mistake.
###1163 MR. LEHRER: All right.
###1164 MR. ROMNEY: Jim, let me just come back on that — on that point.
###1166 MR. LEHRER: Just for the — just for the record —
###1168 MR. ROMNEY: These small businesses we're talking about —
###1169 MR. LEHRER: Excuse me. Just so everybody understands —
###1171 MR. ROMNEY: Yeah.
###1171 MR. LEHRER: — we're way over our first 15 minutes.
###1174 MR. ROMNEY: It's fun, isn't it?
###1175 MR. LEHRER: It's OK. It's great.
###1176 PRESIDENT OBAMA: That's OK.
###1176 MR. LEHRER: No problem. No, you don't have — you don't have a problem, I don't have
###1179 a problem, because we're still on the economy, but we're going to come back to taxes and
###1183 we're going to move on to the deficit and a lot of other things, too.
###1186 OK, but go ahead, sir.
###1187 MR. ROMNEY: You bet.
###1188 Well, President, you're — Mr. President, you're absolutely right, which is that with
###1192 regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not — not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate,
###1196 they're taxed at a lower rate. But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses
###1201 happen to employ half — half — of all of the people who work in small business.
###1206 Those are the businesses that employ one quarter of all the workers in America. And your plan
###1211 is take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent.
###1215 Now, I talked to a guy who has a very small business. He's in the electronics business
###1219 in — in St. Louis. He has four employees.
###1222 He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes. Federal income tax, federal
###1226 payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, state property tax, gasoline tax — it
###1231 added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned.
###1234 And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent.
###1242 The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs. I don't
###1249 want to cost jobs. My priority is jobs. And so what I do is I bring down the tax rates,
###1256 lower deductions and exemptions — the same idea behind Bowles-Simpson, by the way. Get
###1260 the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions to create more jobs, because there's nothing
###1265 better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more
###1270 money, paying — (chuckles) — more taxes. That's by far the most effective and efficient
###1274 way to get this budget balanced.
###1277 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Jim, I — you may want to move on to another topic, but I would just
###1280 say this to the American people. If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add
###1288 $2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for — $7 trillion,
###1294 just to give you a sense, over 10 years that's more than our entire defense budget — and
###1301 you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end
###1306 up picking up the tab, then Governor Romney's plan may work for you.
###1312 But I think math, common sense and our history shows us that's not a recipe for job growth.
###1319 Look, we've tried this — we've tried both approaches. The approach that Governor Romney's
###1326 talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003. And we ended up
###1333 with the slowest job growth in 50 years. We ended up moving from surplus to deficits.
###1341 And it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.
###1345 Bill Clinton tried the approach that I'm talking about. We created 23 million new jobs. We
###1350 went from deficit to surplus, and businesses did very well.
###1357 So in some ways, we've got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and
###1362 opportunity for Americans, and I believe that the economy works best when middle-class families
###1368 are getting tax breaks so that they've got some money in their pockets and those of us
###1372 who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in,
###1378 that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure we're not blowing up the deficit.
###1381 MR. LEHRER: OK. (Inaudible) —
###1382 MR. ROMNEY: Jim, the president began this segment, so I think I get the last word, so
###1385 I'm going to take it. All right? (Chuckles.)
###1386 MR. LEHRER: Well, you're going to get the first word in the next segment.
###1387 MR. ROMNEY: Well, but — but he gets the first word of that segment. I get the last
###1390 word of that segment, I hope. Let me just make this comment.
###1391 PRESIDENT OBAMA: (Chuckles.) He can — you can have it. He can —
###1392 MR. ROMNEY: First of all —
###1393 MR. LEHRER: That's not how it works.
###1394 MR. ROMNEY: Let me — let me repeat — let me repeat what I said — (inaudible). I'm
###1396 not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut. That's not my plan. My plan is not to put in place
###1402 any tax cut that will add to the deficit. That's point one. So you may keep referring
###1406 to it as a $5 trillion tax cut, but that's not my plan.
###1409 PRESIDENT OBAMA: OK.
###1409 MR. ROMNEY: Number two, let's look at history. My plan is not like anything that's been tried
###1414 before. My plan is to bring down rates but also bring down deductions and exemptions
###1419 and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to
###1424 get more people working. My priority is putting people back to work in America. They're suffering
###1429 in this country. And we talk about evidence — look at the evidence of the last four
###1434 years. It's absolutely extraordinary. We've got 23 million people out of work or stop
###1440 looking for work in this country.
###1441 MR. LEHRER: All right.
###1442 MR. ROMNEY: It's just — it's — we've got — we got — when the president took office,
###1445 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today. Economic growth this
###1450 year slower than last year, and last year slower than the year before. Going forward
###1456 with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling
###1459 today.
###1460 MR. LEHRER: All right. Let's talk — we're still on the economy. This is, theoretically
###1464 now, a second segment still on the economy, and specifically on what do about the federal
###1472 deficit, the federal debt. And the question — you each have two minutes on this — and,
###1478 Governor Romney you go first because the president went first on segment one. And the question
###1483 is this: What are the differences between the two of you as to how you would go about
###1488 tackling the deficit problem in this country?
###1490 MR. ROMNEY: Well, good. I'm glad you raised that. And it's a — it's a critical issue.
###1494 I think it's not just an economic issue. I think it's a moral issue. I think it's, frankly,
###1500 not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those
###1505 burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation. And they're going to be paying
###1508 the interest and the principle all their lives. And the amount of debt we're adding, at a
###1513 trillion a year, is simply not moral.
###1515 So how do we deal with it? Well, mathematically there are — there are three ways that you
###1519 can cut a deficit. One, of course, is to raise taxes. Number two is to cut spending. And
###1526 number three is to grow the economy because if more people work in a growing economy they're
###1530 paying taxes and you can get the job done that way.
###1533 The presidents would — president would prefer raising taxes. I understand. The problem with
###1537 raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth and you could never quite get the
###1541 job done. I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time.
###1546 What things would I cut from spending? Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs
###1550 by this test — if they don't pass it: Is the program so critical it's worth borrowing
###1555 money from China to pay for it? And if not, I'll get rid of it. "Obamacare" is on my list.
###1559 I apologize, Mr. President. I use that term with all respect.
###1562 PRESIDENT OBAMA: I like it.
###1563 MR. ROMNEY: Good. OK, good. (Laughter.) So I'll get rid of that. I'm sorry, Jim. I'm
###1567 going to stop the subsidy to PBS. I'm going to stop other things. I like PBS. I love Big
###1571 Bird. I actually like you too. But I'm not going to — I'm not going to keep on spending
###1575 money on things to borrow money from China to pay for it. That's number one.
###1578 Number two, I'll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more
###1582 efficiently at the state level and send them to state.
###1586 Number three, I'll make government more efficient, and to cut back the number of employees, combine
###1590 some agencies and departments. My cutbacks will be done through attrition, by the way.
###1595 This is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget. The president
###1599 said he'd cut the deficit in half. Unfortunately, he doubled it. Trillion-dollar deficits for
###1605 the last four years. The president's put it in place as much public debt — almost as
###1610 much debt held by by the public as all prior presidents combined.
###1614 MR. LEHRER: Mr. President. two minutes.
###1616 PRESIDENT OBAMA: When I walked in the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion dollar
###1620 deficit greeting me, and we know where it came from. Two wars that were paid for on
###1626 a credit card. Two tax cuts that were not paid for, and a whole bunch of programs that
###1633 were not paid for. And then a massive economic crisis.
###1639 And despite that, what we've said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures
###1644 to make sure we didn't slip into a Great Depression. But what we've also said is, let's make sure
###1650 that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow.
###1653 So, 77 government programs — everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered
###1659 but weren't working very well. Eighteen government — 18 government programs for education that
###1665 were well- intentioned but weren't helping kids learn. We went after medical fraud in
###1672 Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively — more aggressively than ever before, and have saved
###1676 tens of billions of dollars. Fifty billion dollars of waste taken out of the system.
###1681 And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary
###1686 domestic budget. That's the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight
###1691 Eisenhower.
###1692 Now, we all know that we've got to do more. And so I've put forward a specific $4 trillion
###1698 deficit-reduction plan.
###1701 It's on a website. You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue
###1706 we raise.
###1707 And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for a dollar of additional revenue,
###1714 paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this
###1719 country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit.
###1722 And Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission. Well, that's how
###1727 the commission — bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested
###1732 we have to do it — in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts. And this
###1738 is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have.
###1740 Let — let me just finish this point because you're looking for contrast. You know, when
###1745 Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination,
###1751 and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue, and he said no.
###1762 Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting
###1768 our investments in schools and education. It means that — Governor Romney talked about
###1774 Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively this means a 30
###1778 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for
###1783 kids who are with disabilities —
###1784 MR. LEHRER: Mr. President, I'm sorry —
###1785 PRESIDENT OBAMA: And that is not a right strategy for us to move forward.
###1788 MR. LEHRER: Way over the two minutes.
###1789 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Sorry.
###1790 MR. LEHRER: Governor, what about Simpson-Bowles. Will you support Simpson-Bowles?
###1793 MR. ROMNEY: Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that.
###1796 MR. LEHRER: No, I mean do you support Simpson-Bowles?
###1797 MR. ROMNEY: I have my own plan. It's not the same as Simpson- Bowles. But in my view, the
###1802 president should have grabbed it. If you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go
###1805 to Congress, fight for it.
###1807 PRESIDENT OBAMA: That's what we've done, made some adjustments to it; and we're putting
###1809 it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan, (a balanced ?) —
###1811 MR. ROMNEY: But you've been — but you've been president four years. You've been president
###1814 four years. You said you'd cut the deficit in half. It's now four years later. We still
###1817 have trillion- dollar deficits.
###1819 The CBO says we'll have a trillion-dollar deficit each of the next four years. If you're
###1823 re-elected, we'll get to a trillion-dollar debt. You have said before you'd cut the deficit
###1828 in half. And this four — I love this idea of 4 trillion (dollars) in cuts. You've found
###1831 $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show
###1836 trillion dollar deficits every year. That doesn't get the job done.
###1839 Let me come back and say, why is that I don't want to raise taxes? Why don't I want to raise
###1845 taxes on people? And actually, you said it back in 2010. You said, look, I'm going to
###1851 extend the tax policies that we have. Now, I'm not going to raise taxes on anyone because
###1855 when the economy's growing slow like this, when we're in recession you shouldn't raise
###1859 taxes on anyone.
###1860 Well, the economy is still growing slow. As a matter of fact, it's growing much more slowly
###1865 now than when you made that statement. And so if you believe the same thing, you just
###1869 don't want to raise taxes on people. And the reality is it's not just wealthy people — you
###1873 mentioned Donald Trump — it's not just Donald Trump you're taxing; it's all those businesses
###1877 that employ one-quarter of the workers in America. These small businesses that are taxed
###1881 as individuals. You raise taxes and you kill jobs. That's why the National Federation of
###1887 Independent Businesses said your plan will kill 700,000 jobs. I don't want to kill jobs
###1892 in this environment.
###1893 Let me make one more point. And that's — and that —
###1896 MR. LEHRER: Let's let him answer the taxes thing for a moment, OK?
###1897 MR. ROMNEY: OK.
###1898 MR. LEHRER: Mr. President.
###1899 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, we've had this discussion before.
###1901 MR. LEHRER: No, about the idea that in order to reduce the deficit there has to be revenue
###1907 in addition to cuts.
###1908 PRESIDENT OBAMA: There has to be revenue in addition to cuts. Now, Governor Romney has
###1911 ruled out revenue. He's — he's ruled out revenue.
###1913 MR. LEHRER: That's true, right?
###1915 MR. ROMNEY: Absolutely.
###1915 PRESIDENT OBAMA: OK, so —
###1916 MR. LEHRER: Completely?
###1917 MR. ROMNEY: I — look, the revenue I get is by more people working, getting higher
###1921 pay, paying more taxes. That's how we get growth and how we balance the budget. But
###1925 the idea of taxing people more, putting more people out of work — you'll never get there.
###1930 You never balance the budget by raising taxes.
###1934 Spain — Spain spends 42 percent of their total economy on government. We're now spending
###1939 42 percent of our economy on government.
###1941 I don't want to go down the path to Spain. I want to go down the path of growth that
###1945 puts Americans to work, with more money coming in because they're working.
###1949 MR. LEHRER: Yeah.
###1950 But Mr. President, you're saying in order to get it — the job done, it's got to be
###1954 balanced. You've got to have —
###1955 PRESIDENT OBAMA: If we're serious, we've got to take a balanced, responsible approach.
###1959 And by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes.
###1963 Let's talk about corporate taxes. Now, I've identified areas where we can, right away,
###1970 make a change that I believe would actually help the economy. The — the oil industry
###1974 gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare. Basically, they get deductions that those
###1981 small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don't get. Now, does anybody think
###1987 that ExxonMobil needs some extra money when they're making money every time you go to
###1994 the pump? Why wouldn't we want to eliminate that?
###1998 Why wouldn't we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets? My attitude is if you got a corporate
###2004 jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it.
###2009 When it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue-neutral
###2014 way, close loopholes, deductions — he hasn't identified which ones they are — but thereby
###2020 bring down the corporate rate. Well, I want to do the same thing, but I've actually identified
###2026 how we can do that.
###2028 And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping
###2032 jobs overseas. Right now you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas.
###2039 I think most Americans would say that doesn't make sense. And all that raises revenue.
###2044 And so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help
###2051 young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can
###2055 afford to go to college. It means that the teacher that I met in Las Vegas, wonderful
###2060 young lady, who describes to me — she's got 42 kids in her class.
###2065 The first two weeks, she's got them — some of them sitting on the floor until finally
###2070 they get reassigned. They're using textbooks that are 10 years old. That is not a recipe
###2076 for growth; that's not how America was built.
###2079 And so budgets reflect choices. Ultimately we're going to have to make some decisions.
###2084 And if we're asking for no revenue, then that means that we've got to get rid of a whole
###2089 bunch of stuff, and the magnitude of the tax cuts that you're talking about, Governor,
###2094 would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not
###2100 help us grow.
###2101 As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we're talking
###2106 about potentially a — a 30 — a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time. Now, you know,
###2113 that may not seem like a big deal when it just is — you know, numbers on a sheet of
###2120 paper, but if we're talking about a family who's got an autistic kid and is depending
###2124 on that Medicaid, that's a big problem. And governors are creative. There's no doubt about
###2129 it. But they're not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something
###2133 like Medicaid. What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help.
###2137 MR. ROMNEY: Jim, let's — we — we've gone on a lot of topics there, and — so I've
###2141 got to take — it's going to take a minute to go from Medicaid to schools to —
###2144 PRESIDENT OBAMA: (Inaudible.)
###2145 MR. LEHRER: Come back to Medicaid, here, yeah, yeah, right.
###2145 MR. ROMNEY: — oil to tax breaks and companies overseas. So let's go through them one by
###2148 one. First of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is
###2153 $2.8 billion a year. And it's actually an accounting treatment, as you know, that's
###2157 been in place for a hundred years. Now —
###2159 PRESIDENT OBAMA: It's time to end it.
###2160 MR. ROMNEY: And — and in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy
###2167 world. Now, I like green energy as well, but that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and
###2173 gas receives, and you say Exxon and Mobil — actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely
###2178 to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth.
###2180 But you know, if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why, that $2.8
###2185 billion is on the table. Of course it's on the table. That's probably not going to survive,
###2189 you get that rate down to 25 percent.
###2191 But — but don't forget, you put $90 billion — like 50 years worth of breaks — into
###2198 solar and wind, to — to Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1. I mean, I — I had a
###2204 friend who said, you don't just pick the winners and losers; you pick the losers. All right?
###2208 So — so this is not — this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want
###2212 to get America energy-secure.
###2214 The second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for getting a plant overseas.
###2218 Look, I've been in business for 25 years. I have no idea what you're talking about.
###2223 I maybe need to get a new accountant.
###2224 MR. LEHRER: Let's —
###2225 MR. ROMNEY: But the — the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is
###2228 simply not the case.
###2229 MR. LEHRER: Let's have —
###2229 MR. ROMNEY: What we do have right now is a setting —
###2231 MR. LEHRER: Excuse me.
###2231 MR. ROMNEY: — where I'd like to bring money from overseas back to this country.
###2234 And finally, Medicaid to states, I'm not quite sure where that came in, except this, which
###2238 is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you're
###2243 going to get what you got last year plus inflation — inflation — plus 1 percent. And then
###2249 you're going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best.
###2252 And I remember as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors,
###2258 Republican and Democrats, said, please let us do that. We can care for our own poor in
###2263 so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how
###2268 to care for our poor.
###2270 So let states — one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that
###2274 states are the laboratories of democracy. Don't have the federal government tell everybody
###2278 what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to
###2283 have. Let states do this.
###2284 And by the way, if a states get — gets in trouble, why, we could step in and see if
###2287 we could find a way to help them. But —
###2289 MR. LEHRER: Let's go.
###2289 MR. ROMNEY: But — but the right — the right approach is one which relies on the
###2293 brilliance —
###2293 MR. LEHRER: Two seconds.
###2293 MR. ROMNEY: — of our people and states, not the federal government.
###2295 MR. LEHRER: Two seconds and we're going on, still on the economy on another — but another
###2298 part of it.
###2299 PRESIDENT OBAMA: OK.
###2299 MR. LEHRER: All right? All right, this is this is segment three, the economy, entitlements.
###2305 First answer goes to you. It's two minutes. Mr. President, do you see a major difference
###2311 between the two of you on Social Security?
###2312 PRESIDENT OBAMA: You know, I suspect that on Social Security, we've got a somewhat similar
###2319 position. Social Security is structurally sound. It's going to have to be tweaked the
###2323 way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker — Democratic Speaker Tip O'Neill. But it is — the basic
###2330 structure is sound. But — but I want to talk about the values behind Social Security
###2335 and Medicare and then talk about Medicare, because that's the big driver —
###2339 MR. LEHRER: Sure — it — you bet.
###2339 PRESIDENT OBAMA: — of our deficits right now.
###2341 You know, my grandmother, some of you know, helped to raise me. My grandparents did. My
###2348 grandfather died awhile back. My grandmother died three days before I was elected president.
###2354 And she was fiercely independent. She worked her way up, only had a high school education,
###2357 started as a secretary, ended up being the vice president of a local bank. And she ended
###2364 up living alone by choice. And the reason she could be independent was because of Social
###2370 Security and Medicare. She had worked all her life, put in this money and understood
###2376 that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go.
###2380 And that's the perspective I bring when I think about what's called entitlements. You
###2384 know, the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks. These
###2389 are folks who've worked hard, like my grandmother. And there are millions of people out there
###2393 who are counting on this.
###2395 So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term? And in Medicare,
###2402 what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if we're going to
###2407 deal with our long- term deficits, but to do that, let's look where some of the money
###2412 is going. Seven hundred and sixteen billion dollars we were able to save from the Medicare
###2417 program by no longer overpaying insurance companies, by making sure that we weren't
###2423 overpaying providers.
###2426 And using that money, we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors
###2429 by an average of $600, and we were also able to make a — make a significant dent in providing
###2435 them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the — throughout
###2439 the system.
###2440 So the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs.
###2446 But when it comes to Social Security, as I said, you don't need a major structural change
###2451 in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future.
###2454 MR. LEHRER: We'll follow up on this.
###2455 First, Governor Romney, you have two minutes on Social Security and entitlements.
###2460 MR. ROMNEY: Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs. And I know any time we
###2465 talk about entitlements, people become concerned that something's going to happen that's going
###2469 to change their life for the worst, and the answer is, neither the president nor I are
###2474 proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security
###2480 or Medicare. So if you're 60 or around 60 or older, you don't need to listen any further.
###2485 But for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring.
###2489 Oh, I just thought about one, and that is in fact I was wrong when I said the president
###2493 isn't proposing any changes for current retirees. In fact, he is on Medicare. On Social Security,
###2497 he's not.
###2498 But on Medicare, for current retirees he's cutting $716 billion from the program. Now,
###2505 he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers, actually just going to them and saying we're
###2510 going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody's going to get a lower
###2514 rate. That's not just going after places where there's abuse, that's saying we're cutting
###2517 the rates. Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won't take anymore
###2522 Medicare patients under that scenario.
###2525 We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won't take more Medicare patients. This
###2531 — we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because
###2535 of those $716 billion in cuts. I can't understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for
###2544 current recipients of Medicare.
###2546 Now, you point out, well, we're putting some back; we're going to give a better prescription
###2549 program. That's one — that's $1 for every 15 (dollars) you've cut. They're smart enough
###2554 to know that's not a good trade.
###2556 I want to take that $716 billion you've cut and put it back into Medicare. By the way,
###2562 we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it, but the idea of cutting
###2566 $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of "Obamacare" is, in
###2572 my opinion, a mistake. And with regards to young people coming along, I've got proposals
###2576 to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question.
###2581 MR. LEHRER: Mr. President.
###2583 PRESIDENT OBAMA: First of all, I think it's important for Governor Romney to present this
###2587 plan that he says will only affect folks in the future. And the essence of the plan is
###2593 that he would turn Medicare into a voucher program. It's called premium support, but
###2600 it's understood to be a voucher program. His running mate —
###2603 MR. LEHRER: And you — and you don't support that?
###2603 PRESIDENT OBAMA: I don't. And — and let me explain why.
###2606 MR. ROMNEY: Again, that's for future people —
###2608 PRESIDENT OBAMA: I understand.
###2608 MR. ROMNEY: — right, not for current retirees.
###2609 PRESIDENT OBAMA: For — for — so if you're — if you — you're 54 or 55, you might
###2613 want to listen, because this — this will affect you. The idea, which was originally
###2619 presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors,
###2628 and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance. The problem
###2634 is that because the voucher wouldn't necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was
###2639 estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year.
###2644 Now, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is he'll maintain traditional Medicare
###2649 alongside it. But there's still a problem, because what happens is those insurance companies
###2655 are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors.
###2660 They recruit them leaving the older, sicker seniors in Medicare. And every health care
###2666 economist who looks at it says over time what'll happen is the traditional Medicare system
###2670 will collapse. And then what you've got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of
###2675 the private insurance system, precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent
###2681 health care.
###2682 So I don't think vouchers are the right way to go. And this is not my own — only my
###2688 opinion. AARP thinks that the — the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the
###2695 system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by 8 years. Benefits were not affected at all
###2702 and ironically if you repeal "Obamacare" — and I have become fond of this term, "Obamacare"
###2708 — (laughter) — if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going
###2712 to be paying $600 more in prescription care. They're now going to have to be paying copays
###2717 for basic check-ups that can keep them healthier.
###2721 And the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated
###2730 to gain billions of dollars back when they aren't making seniors any healthier. And I
###2735 — I don't think that's right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger
###2740 over the long term.
###2740 MR. LEHRER: We'll talk about — specifically about health care in a moment, but what is
###2744 — do you support the voucher system, Governor?
###2746 MR. ROMNEY: What I support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare
###2753 and the president supports taking $716 billion out of that program.
###2757 MR. LEHRER: What about the vouchers?
###2758 MR. ROMNEY: So that's — that's number one.
###2759 MR. LEHRER: OK. All right.
###2759 MR. ROMNEY: Number two is for people coming along that are young. What I'd do to make
###2764 sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the
###2769 current Medicare program or a private plan — their choice. They get to — and they'll
###2774 have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them. So they don't have to
###2779 pay additional money, no additional $6,000. That's not going to happen.
###2782 They'll have at least two plans.
###2783 And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer
###2787 premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare,
###2792 or they'll be able to get a private plan. I know my own view is I'd rather have a private
###2796 plan. I — I'd just as soon not have the government telling me what kind of health
###2799 care I get. I'd rather be able to have an insurance company. If I don't like them, I
###2802 can get rid of them and find a different insurance company. But people will make their own choice.
###2806 The other thing we have to do to save Medicare, we have to have the benefits high for those
###2810 that are low-income, but for higher-income people, we're going to have to lower some
###2815 of the benefits. We have to make sure this program is there for the long term. That's
###2819 the plan that I've put forward.
###2820 And by the way, the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or — or Senator Wyden, who's a
###2824 co-author of the bill with — with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill
###2828 Clinton's — Bill Clinton's chief of staff. This is an idea that's been around a long
###2832 time, which is saying, hey, let's see if we can't get competition into the Medicare world
###2837 so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality. I believe
###2842 in competition.
###2843 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Jim, if I — if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every
###2847 study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative cost than private insurance does, which is
###2853 why seniors are generally pretty happy with it. And private insurers have to make a profit.
###2858 Nothing wrong with that; that's what they do. And so you've got higher administrative
###2864 costs, plus profit on top of that, and if you are going to save any money through what
###2872 Governor Romney's proposing, what has to happen is is that the money has to come from somewhere.
###2877 And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those
###2883 insurance companies. And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then
###2891 they're stuck. And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken
###2898 Medicare substantially, and that's why they were supportive of the approach that we took.
###2904 One last point I want to make. We do have to lower the cost of health care. Not just
###2909 in Medicare and —
###2910 MR. LEHRER: We'll talk about that in a minute.
###2910 PRESIDENT OBAMA: — but — but overall.
###2911 MR. LEHRER: Go. OK.
###2913 PRESIDENT OBAMA: And so —
###2914 MR. ROMNEY: That's — that's a big topic. Could we — could we stay on Medicare?
###2915 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Is that a — is that a separate topic? I'm sorry.
###2915 MR. LEHRER: Yeah, we're going to — yeah. I want to get to it, but all I want to do
###2918 is very quickly —
###2919 MR. ROMNEY: Let's get back to Medicare.
###2920 MR. LEHRER: — before we leave the economy —
###2921 MR. ROMNEY: Let's get back to Medicare.
###2922 MR. LEHRER: No, no, no, no —
###2922 MR. ROMNEY: The president said that the government can provide the service at lower —
###2926 MR. LEHRER: No.
###2926 MR. ROMNEY: — cost and without a profit.
###2927 MR. LEHRER: All right.
###2927 MR. ROMNEY: If that's the case, then it will always be the best product that people can
###2931 purchase. But my experience —
###2933 MR. LEHRER: Wait a minute, Governor.
###2933 MR. ROMNEY: My experience is the private sector typically is able to provide a better product
###2936 at a lower cost.
###2937 MR. LEHRER: Can we — can the two of you agree that the voters have a choice, a clear
###2942 choice between the two of you —
###2943 MR. ROMNEY: Absolutely.
###2944 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yes.
###2944 MR. LEHRER: — on Medicare?
###2945 MR. ROMNEY: Absolutely.
###2945 MR. LEHRER: All right. So, to finish quickly, briefly, on the economy, what is your view
###2950 about the level of federal regulation of the economy right now? Is there too much, and
###2955 in your case, Mr. President, is there — should there be more? Beginning with you — this
###2961 is not a new two-minute segment — to start, and we'll go for a few minutes and then we're
###2965 going to go to health care. OK?
###2966 MR. ROMNEY: Regulation is essential. You can't have a free market work if you don't have
###2972 regulation. As a business person, I had to have — I needed to know the regulations.
###2976 I needed them there. You couldn't have people opening up banks in their — in their garage
###2980 and making loans. I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy
###2985 work. Every free economy has good regulation.
###2987 At the same time, regulation can become excessive.
###2990 MR. LEHRER: Is it excessive now, do you think?
###2991 MR. ROMNEY: In some places, yes, in other places, no.
###2993 MR. LEHRER: Like where?
###2993 MR. ROMNEY: It can become out of date. And what's happened in — with some of the legislation
###2998 that's been passed during the president's term, you've seen regulation become excessive
###3003 and it's hurt the — it's hurt the economy. Let me give you an example. Dodd- Frank was
###3008 passed, and it includes within it a number of provisions that I think have some unintended
###3013 consequences that are harmful to the economy. One is it designates a number of banks as
###3018 too big to fail, and they're effectively guaranteed by the federal government.
###3021 This is the biggest kiss that's been given to — to New York banks I've ever seen. This
###3026 is an enormous boon for them. There's been — 122 community and small banks have closed
###3031 since Dodd-Frank. So there's one example.
###3033 Here's another. In Dodd-Frank, it says that —
###3035 MR. LEHRER: You want to repeal Dodd-Frank?
###3036 MR. ROMNEY: Well, I would repeal it and replace it. You — we're not going to get rid of
###3039 all regulation. You have to have regulation. And there's some parts of Dodd-Frank that
###3043 make all the sense in the world. You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits
###3049 for institutes —
###3050 MR. LEHRER: Well, here's a specific — let's — excuse me —
###3051 MR. ROMNEY: Let me mention the other one. Let's talk the —
###3053 MR. LEHRER: No, no, let's do — right now, let's not. Let's let him respond.
###3056 MR. ROMNEY: OK.
###3056 MR. LEHRER: Let's let him respond to this specific on Dodd-Frank and what the governor
###3060 just said.
###3061 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, I think this is a great example. The reason we have been in such a
###3068 enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board. Now, it wasn't
###3077 just on Wall Street. You had — loan officers were — they were giving loans and mortgages
###3082 that really shouldn't have been given, because they're — the folks didn't qualify. You
###3087 had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn't afford. You had
###3091 credit agencies that were stamping these as A-1 (ph) great investments when they weren't.
###3097 But you also had banks making money hand-over-fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves
###3103 didn't even understand in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire
###3110 system vulnerable.
###3112 So what did we do? We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the
###3119 1930s. We said you've got — banks, you've got to raise your capital requirements. You
###3123 can't engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk. We're
###3127 going to make sure that you've got to have a living will, so — so we can know how you're
###3132 going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don't have other taxpayer bailouts.
###3136 In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided those
###3141 banks was paid back, every single dime, with interest.
###3144 Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank, and, you know, I appreciate,
###3151 and it appears we've got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation,
###3156 but in the past, Governor Romney has said he just wants to repeal Dodd-Frank, roll it
###3160 back. And so the question is does anybody out there think that the big problem we had
###3168 is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street? Because if you do, then Governor
###3176 Romney is your candidate. But that's not what I believe.
###3181 MR. ROMNEY: (Inaudible) — sorry, Jim. That — that's just not — that's just not the
###3183 facts. Look, we have to have regulation of Wall Street.
###3186 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yeah.
###3186 MR. ROMNEY: That — that's why I'd have regulation. But I wouldn't designate five banks as too
###3190 big to fail and give them a blank check. That's one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank.
###3196 It wasn't thought through properly. We need to get rid of that provision, because it's
###3199 killing regional and small banks. They're getting hurt.
###3202 Let me mention another regulation of Dodd-Frank. You say we were giving mortgages to people
###3206 who weren't qualified. That's exactly right. It's one of the reasons for the great financial
###3210 calamity we had. And so Dodd-Frank correctly says we need to —
###3215 MR. LEHRER: All right.
###3215 MR. ROMNEY: — have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that's not qualified,
###3218 there are big penalties. Except they didn't ever go on to define what a qualified mortgage
###3223 was.
###3223 MR. LEHRER: All right.
###3224 MR. ROMNEY: It's been two years. We don't know what a qualified mortgage is yet. So
###3227 banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages. Try and get a mortgage these days. It's hurt
###3233 the housing market —
###3234 MR. LEHRER: All right —
###3235 MR. ROMNEY: — because Dodd-Frank didn't anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations
###3239 you have to have. It's not that Dodd- Frank always was wrong with too much regulation.
###3244 Sometimes they didn't come out with a clear regulation.
###3246 MR. LEHRER: OK.
###3246 MR. ROMNEY: I will make sure we don't hurt the functioning of our — of our marketplace
###3251 and our businesses, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs.
###3254 MR. LEHRER: All right, I think we have another clear difference between the two of you. Now
###3260 let's move to health care, where I know there is a clear difference — (laughter) — and
###3265 that has to do with the Affordable Care Act, "Obamacare."
###3268 And it's a two-minute new segment, and it's — that means two minutes each. And you go
###3274 first, Governor Romney. You wanted repeal. You want the Affordable Care Act repealed.
###3279 Why?
###3279 MR. ROMNEY: I sure do. Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience. I was in New Hampshire.
###3286 A woman came to me, and she said, look, I can't afford insurance for myself or my son.
###3290 I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, we're thinking of dropping our
###3295 insurance; we can't afford it. And the number of small businesses I've gone to that are
###3298 saying they're dropping insurance because they can't afford it — the cost of health
###3302 care is just prohibitive. And — and we've got to deal with cost.
###3306 And unfortunately, when — when you look at "Obamacare," the Congressional Budget Office
###3311 has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance. So it's adding to cost.
###3318 And as a matter of fact, when the president ran for office, he said that by this year
###3322 he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2,500 a family. Instead,
###3328 it's gone up by that amount. So it's expensive. Expensive things hurt families. So that's
###3333 one reason I don't want it.
###3334 Second reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for it. I want to put that money back
###3340 in Medicare for our seniors.
###3342 Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that's going to tell people, ultimately,
###3347 what kind of treatments they can have. I don't like that idea.
###3350 Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country. It said, what's been the
###3356 effect of "Obamacare" on your hiring plans? And three-quarters of them said, it makes
###3360 us less likely to hire people. I just don't know how the president could have come into
###3366 office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at
###3371 the — at the kitchen table and spent his energy and passion for two years fighting
###3375 for "Obamacare" instead of fighting for jobs for the American people.
###3379 It has killed jobs. And the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state,
###3385 craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state. And then let's focus
###3391 on getting the costs down for people rather than raising it with the $2,500 additional
###3396 premium.
###3396 MR. LEHRER: Mr. President, the argument against repeal.
###3399 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, four years ago when I was running for office I was traveling around
###3404 and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about. And it wasn't just that
###3410 small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldn't get affordable coverage
###3415 even if they wanted to provide it to their employees; it wasn't just that this was the
###3419 biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs. But it was families
###3424 who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick — millions of families, all across
###3429 the country.
###3430 If they had a pre-existing condition they might not be able to get coverage at all.
###3435 If they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit. And so as
###3443 a consequence, they're paying their premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold they
###3447 don't have enough money to pay the bills because the insurance companies say that they've hit
###3452 the limit. So we did work on this alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making
###3459 sure that middle-class families are secure in this country.
###3462 And let me tell you exactly what "Obamacare" did. Number one, if you've got health insurance
###3468 it doesn't mean a government take over. You keep your own insurance. You keep your own
###3474 doctor. But it does say insurance companies can't jerk you around. They can't impose arbitrary
###3479 lifetime limits. They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance — your insurance
###3485 plan till you're 26 years old. And it also says that they're — you're going to have
###3491 to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and
###3497 profits than they are on actual care.
###3501 Number two, if you don't have health insurance, we're essentially setting up a group plan
###3506 that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if
###3512 you're out there trying to get insurance on the individual market.
###3515 Now, the last point I'd make before —
###3518 MR. LEHRER: Two minutes —
###3518 PRESIDENT OBAMA: — before —
###3519 MR. LEHRER: Two minutes is up, sir.
###3519 PRESIDENT OBAMA: No, I — I think I've — I had five seconds before you interrupted me
###3522 — was — (laughter) — that the irony is that we've seen this model work really
###3530 well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in
###3540 the state to set up what is essentially the identical model. And as a consequence, people
###3547 are covered there. It hasn't destroyed jobs. And as a consequence, we now have a system
###3554 in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down cost, as opposed to just —
###3558 MR. LEHRER: Your five —
###3559 PRESIDENT OBAMA: — leaving millions of people out in the cold.
###3561 MR. LEHRER: Your five seconds went away a long time ago. (Laughter.)
###3563 PRESIDENT OBAMA: That —
###3564 MR. LEHRER: All right, Governor. Governor, tell the — tell the president directly why
###3569 you think what he just said is wrong about "Obamacare."
###3571 MR. ROMNEY: Well, I did with my first statement.
###3573 PRESIDENT OBAMA: You did.
###3573 MR. ROMNEY: But I'll go on.
###3575 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Please elaborate.
###3575 MR. ROMNEY: I'll elaborate.
###3576 Exactly right.
###3577 First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts. I like the fact that in my
###3582 state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together. What you did instead
###3587 was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote. As a matter of fact, when
###3591 Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary, elected a Republican senator to stop "Obamacare,"
###3596 you pushed it through anyway. So entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America
###3600 together and having a discussion on this important topic, you pushed through something that you
###3604 and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best answer and drove it through.
###3608 What we did, in a legislature 87 percent Democrat, we worked together. Two hundred legislators
###3615 in my legislature — only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished.
###3619 What were some differences?
###3620 We didn't raise taxes. You've raised them by a trillion dollars under "Obamacare." We
###3624 didn't cut Medicare. Of course, we don't have Medicare, but we didn't cut Medicare by $716
###3629 billion. We didn't put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments
###3633 they're going to receive.
###3635 We didn't — we didn't also do something that I think a number of people across this
###3640 country recognize, which is put — put people in a position where they're going to lose
###3643 the insurance they had and they wanted. Right now, the CBO says up to 20 million people
###3649 will lose their insurance as "Obamacare" goes into effect next year. And likewise, a study
###3654 by McKinsey & Company of American businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping
###3659 people from coverage. So for those reasons, for the tax, for Medicare, for this board
###3664 and for people losing their insurance, this is why the American people don't want — don't
###3669 want "Obamacare." It's why Republicans said, do not do this.
###3673 And the Republicans had a — had a plan. They put a plan out. They put out a plan,
###3676 a bipartisan plan. It was swept aside. I think something this big, this important has to
###3682 be done in a bipartisan basis. And we have to have a president who can reach across the
###3686 aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties.
###3691 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis. This
###3695 was a bipartisan idea. In fact, it was a Republican idea.
###3699 And Governor Romney, at the beginning of this debate, wrote and said, what we did in Massachusetts
###3704 could be a model for the nation. And I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts
###3710 might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the
###3715 fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it's the same plan.
###3721 It — when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example — unelected board that
###3727 we've created — what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera,
###3733 to figure out how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall, because the — there
###3741 are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis.
###3745 One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves,
###3750 to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally
###3755 they just give up and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that's been the
###3759 trend line. Or, alternatively, we can figure out how do we make the cost of care more effective.
###3764 And there are ways of doing it.
###3766 So at — at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they
###3772 actually provide great care cheaper than average. And the reason they do is because they do
###3779 some smart things. They — they say, if a patient's coming in, let's get all the doctors
###3783 together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests. Let's
###3790 make sure that we're providing preventive care so we're catching the onset of something
###3794 like diabetes. Let's — let's pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to
###3802 on the basis of how many procedures they've — they've engaged in. Now, so what this
###3810 board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let's use the purchasing power of
###3815 Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do.
###3821 And the fact of the matter is that when "Obamacare" is fully implemented, we're going to be in
###3828 a position to show that costs are going down. And over the last two years, health care premiums
###3835 have gone up, it's true, but they've gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years.
###3840 So we're already beginning to see progress. In the meantime, folks out there with insurance,
###3845 you're already getting a rebate.
###3847 Let me make one last point. Governor Romney says we should replace it. I'm just going
###3853 to repeal it, but we can replace it with something. But the problem is he hasn't described what
###3858 exactly we'd replace it with other than saying we're going to leave it to the states.
###3862 But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he's offered, like
###3868 letting you buy insurance across state lines, there's no indication that that somehow is
###3872 going to help somebody who's got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance.
###3876 In fact, it's estimated that by repealing "Obamacare," you're looking at 50 million
###3881 people losing health insurance at a time when it's vitally important.
###3885 MR. LEHRER: Let's let the governor explain what you would do if "Obamacare" is repealed.
###3889 How would you replace it? What do you have in mind?
###3891 MR. ROMNEY: Let — well, actually — actually it's — it's — it's a lengthy description,
###3895 but number one, pre-existing conditions are covered under my plan. Number two, young people
###3900 are able to stay on their family plan. That's already offered in the private marketplace;
###3904 you don't have — have the government mandate that for that to occur.
###3907 But let's come back to something the president — I agree on, which is the — the key task
###3912 we have in health care is to get the costs down so it's more affordable for families,
###3917 and — and then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government,
###3923 an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you
###3927 ought to have.
###3927 PRESIDENT OBAMA: No, it isn't.
###3928 MR. ROMNEY: In my opinion, the government is not effective in — in bringing down the
###3934 cost of almost anything. As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to
###3939 find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the costs
###3943 than the government will ever be. Your example of the Cleveland clinic is my case in point,
###3948 along with several others I could describe. This is the private market. These are small
###3953 — these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better
###3958 jobs.
###3958 I used to consult to businesses — excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers.
###3962 I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people. In order
###3969 to bring the cost of health care down, we don't need to have a — an — a board of
###3972 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have. We instead need to put insurance
###3979 plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on targets such that they have an incentive, as you say,
###3985 performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that's happening.
###3989 Intermountain Health Care does it superbly well.
###3991 PRESIDENT OBAMA: They do.
###3992 MR. ROMNEY: Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others. But the right
###3996 answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating
###4002 to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment
###4007 they can have. That's the wrong way to go. The private market and individual responsibility
###4013 always work best.
###4014 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Let me just point out, first of all, this board that we're talking about
###4018 can't make decisions about what treatments are given. That's explicitly prohibited in
###4024 the law.
###4026 But let's go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan he would be
###4031 able to cover people with pre-existing conditions. Well, actually, Governor, that isn't what
###4038 your plan does. What your plan does is to duplicate what's already the law, which says
###4044 if you are out of health insurance for three months then you can end up getting continuous
###4051 coverage and an insurance company can't deny you if you've — if it's been under 90 days.
###4059 But that's already the law. And that doesn't help the millions of people out there with
###4064 pre-existing conditions. There's a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he
###4069 did in Massachusetts. It wasn't a government takeover of health care. It was the largest
###4073 expansion of private insurance. But what it does say is that insurers, you've got to take
###4080 everybody. Now, that also means that you've got more customers.
###4084 But when Governor Romney says that he'll replace it with something but can't detail how it
###4091 will be in fact replaced, and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts
###4097 is because there isn't a better way of dealing with the pre-existing conditions problem,
###4102 it — it just reminds me of — you know, he says that he's going to close deductions
###4105 and loopholes for his tax plan.
###4108 That's how it's going to be paid for. But we don't know the details. He says that he's
###4112 going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform. But we don't know exactly which ones. He won't
###4120 tell us. He now says he's going to replace "Obamacare" and assure that all the good things
###4124 that are in it are going to be in there and you don't have to worry.
###4129 And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that
###4133 Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they're too good?
###4141 Is — is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from
###4145 them? No, the — the reason is because when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the
###4152 problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems, and we've
###4158 got to make choices. And the choices we've made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting
###4162 middle-class families all across the country.
###4164 MR. LEHRER: All right, we're going to move to a —
###4165 MR. ROMNEY: No, I — I have to respond to that —
###4166 MR. LEHRER: No, but —
###4166 MR. ROMNEY: — which is — which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and — and
###4172 lay down a piece of legislation and say it's my way or the highway, I don't get a lot done.
###4177 What I do is the same way that Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years
###4180 ago. When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going
###4186 to foster. He said he was going to lower tax rates. He said he was going to broaden the
###4190 base. You've said the same thing: You're going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base.
###4194 Those are my principles.
###4195 I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families. And I'm going to work together with
###4199 Congress to say, OK, what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance?
###4204 One way, for instance, would be to have a single number. Make up a number — 25,000
###4208 (dollars), $50,000. Anybody can have deductions up to that amount. And then that number disappears
###4213 for high-income people. That's one way one could do it. One could follow Bowles-Simpson
###4218 as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way.
###4222 There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden
###4227 the base, simplify the code and create incentives for growth.
###4232 And with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre-existing condition
###4237 plan. You obviously studied up on — on my plan. In fact, I do have a plan that deals
###4241 with people with pre-existing conditions. That's part of my health care plan. And what
###4245 we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation, state by state. And I said that at
###4250 that time. The federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking
###4255 aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not
###4260 the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy.
###4263 MR. LEHRER: That is a terrific segue to our next segment, and is the role of government.
###4273 And let's see, role of government and it is — you are first on this, Mr. President.
###4278 The question is this. Do you believe — both of you — but you have the first two minutes
###4284 on this, Mr. President — do you believe there's a fundamental difference between the
###4288 two of you as to how you view the mission of the federal government?
###4293 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, I definitely think there are differences.
###4296 MR. LEHRER: And — yeah.
###4298 PRESIDENT OBAMA: The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people
###4301 safe. That's its most basic function. And as commander in chief, that is something that
###4308 I've worked on and thought about every single day that I've been in the Oval Office.
###4315 But I also believe that government has the capacity — the federal government has the
###4320 capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks
###4327 where the American people can succeed. Look, the genius of America is the free enterprise
###4332 system, and freedom, and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work
###4338 on an idea, make their own decisions.
###4341 But as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together.
###4347 So in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said, let's help to finance the Transcontinental
###4353 Railroad. Let's start the National Academy of Sciences. Let's start land grant colleges,
###4362 because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all Americans, because if
###4368 all Americans are getting opportunity, we're all going to be better off. That doesn't restrict
###4372 people's freedom; that enhances it.
###4375 And so what I've tried to do as president is to apply those same principles. And when
###4381 it comes to education, what I've said is we've got to reform schools that are not working.
###4386 We use something called Race to the Top. Wasn't a top-down approach, Governor. What we've
###4390 said is to states, we'll give you more money if you initiate reforms. And as a consequence,
###4397 you had 46 states around the country who have made a real difference.
###4401 But what I've also said is let's hire another hundred thousand math and science teachers
###4406 to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to
###4411 succeed. And hard-pressed states right now can't all do that. In fact, we've seen layoffs
###4418 of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney
###4423 doesn't think we need more teachers. I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment
###4428 where the federal government can help. It can't do it all, but it can make a difference,
###4433 and as a consequence, we'll have a better-trained workforce, and that will create jobs, because
###4437 companies want to locate in places where we've got a skilled workforce.
###4440 MR. LEHRER: Two minutes, Governor, on the role of government, your view.
###4443 MR. ROMNEY: Well, first, I love great schools. Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number
###4447 one of all 50 states. And the key to great schools: great teachers. So I reject the idea
###4452 that I don't believe in great teachers or more teachers. Every school district, every
###4456 state should make that decision on their own.
###4458 The role of government — look behind us: the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.
###4464 The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents. First,
###4472 life and liberty. We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our
###4476 people, and that means the military, second to none. I do not believe in cutting our military.
###4481 I believe in maintaining the strength of America's military.
###4484 Second, in that line that says, we are endowed by our Creator with our rights — I believe
###4490 we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country. That
###4496 statement also says that we are endowed by our Creator with the right to pursue happiness
###4501 as we choose. I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate
###4505 and can't care for themselves are cared by — by one another.
###4508 We're a nation that believes we're all children of the same God. And we care for those that
###4513 have difficulties — those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that
###4517 disabled, we care for them. And we look for discovery and innovation, all these thing
###4521 desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens.
###4528 But we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams, and not
###4533 to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals. And what we're
###4538 seeing right now is, in my view, a — a trickle-down government approach which has government thinking
###4544 it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams. And it's not working.
###4549 And the proof of that is 23 million people out of work. The proof of that is one out
###4552 of six people in poverty. The proof of that is we've gone from 32 million on food stamps
###4557 to 47 million on food stamps. The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates
###4563 this year can't find work.
###4564 PRESIDENT OBAMA: (Inaudible) —
###4565 MR. ROMNEY: We know that the path we're taking is not working. It's time for a new path.
###4569 MR. LEHRER: All right, let's go through some specifics in terms of what — how each of
###4572 you views the role of government. How do — education. Does the federal government have a responsibility
###4579 to improve the quality of public education in America?
###4582 MR. ROMNEY: Well, the primary responsibility for education is — is of course at the state
###4586 and local level. But the federal government also can play a very important role. And I
###4589 — and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan. He's — there's some ideas he's put forward
###4593 on Race to the Top — not all of them but some of them I agree with, and congratulate
###4597 him for pursuing that. The federal government can get local and — and state schools to
###4601 do a better job.
###4602 My own view, by the way, is I've added to that. I happen to believe — I want the kids
###4607 that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or — or Title I — these are disabled kids
###4611 or — or poor kids or — or lower-income kids, rather. I want them to be able to go
###4616 to the school of their choice. So all federal funds, instead of going to the — to the
###4621 state or to the school district, I'd have go — if you will, follow the child and let
###4625 the parent and the child decide where to send their — their — their student.
###4628 MR. LEHRER: How do you see the federal government's responsibility to — as I say, to improve
###4633 the quality of public education in this country?
###4635 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, as I've indicated, I think that it has a significant role to
###4638 play. Through our Race to the Top program, we've worked with Republican and Democratic
###4643 governors to initiate major reforms, and they're having an impact right now.
###4647 MR. LEHRER: Do you think you have a difference with your views and those of Governor Romney
###4651 on — about education and the federal government?
###4653 PRESIDENT OBAMA: You know, this is where budgets matter because budgets reflect choices. So
###4659 when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks
###4668 like me and him, and to pay for it, we're having to initiate significant cuts in federal
###4676 support for education, that makes a difference.
###4679 You know, his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of
###4684 the principles that Governor Romney's talked about. And it wasn't very detailed. This seems
###4690 to be a trend. But — but what it did do is to — if you extrapolated how much money
###4695 we're talking about, you'd look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent.
###4701 When it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over
###4707 the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right
###4711 now. And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting
###4715 businesses to work with community colleges so that they're setting up their training
###4719 programs —
###4719 MR. LEHRER: Do you agree, Governor?
###4720 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Let — let — let me just finish the point.
###4722 MR. ROMNEY: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
###4723 PRESIDENT OBAMA: I suspect it'll be a small agreement.
###4725 MR. ROMNEY: It's going over well in my state, by the way, yeah.
###4727 PRESIDENT OBAMA: The — where their partnering so that — they're designing training programs,
###4733 and people who are going through them know that there's a job waiting for them if they
###4736 complete them. That makes a big difference. But that requires some federal support.
###4740 Let me just say one final example. When it comes to making college affordable — whether
###4747 it's two-year or four-year — one of the things that I did as president was we were
###4751 sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middle men for the student loan program, even
###4757 though the loans were guaranteed. So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders but
###4762 they were taking billions out of the system.
###4763 And we said, why not cut out the middle man? And as a consequence, what we've been able
###4768 to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates
###4776 on student loans. And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference. Governor
###4782 Romney, I genuinely believe, cares about education. But when he tells a student that, you know,
###4790 you should borrow money from your parents to go to college, you know, that indicates
###4795 the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks
###4801 like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver just don't
###4807 have that option.
###4807 And for us to be able to make sure that they've got that opportunity and they can walk through
###4812 that door, that is vitally important — not just to those kids. It's how we're going to
###4816 grow this economy over the long term.
###4818 MR. LEHRER: We're running out of time.
###4820 MR. ROMNEY: Jim, Jim —
###4820 MR. LEHRER: I'm certainly going give you a chance to respond to that. Yes, sir, Governor.
###4823 MR. ROMNEY: Mr. — Mr. President, you're entitled, as the president, to your own airplane
###4826 and to your own house, but not to your own facts — (laughter) — all right? I'm — I'm
###4829 not going to cut education funding. I don't have any plan to cut education funding and
###4834 grants that go to people going to college. I'm planning on continuing to grow, so I'm
###4837 not planning on making changes there.
###4839 But you make a very good point, which is that the — the place you put your money makes
###4843 a pretty clear indication of where your heart is. You put $90 billion into — into green
###4850 jobs. And — and I — look, I'm all in favor of green energy. Ninety billion (dollars)
###4855 — that — that would have — that would have hired 2 million teachers. Ninety billion
###4859 dollars. And these businesses — many of them have gone out of business. I think about
###4863 half of them, of the ones have been invested in, they've gone out of business. A number
###4866 of them happened to be owned by — by people who were contributors to your campaigns.
###4870 Look, the right course for — for America's government — we were talking about the role
###4875 of government — is not to become the economic player picking winners and losers, telling
###4880 people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system
###4885 that — that has existed in this country for — for a long, long time and has produced
###4889 the best health records in the world. The right answer for government is to say, how
###4893 do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective?
###4896 How do we get schools to be more competitive? Let's grade them. I propose we grade our schools
###4901 so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child
###4905 to a — to a school that's being more successful. I don't — I don't want to cut our commitment
###4909 to education; I wanted to make it more effective and efficient.
###4913 And by the way, I've had that experience. I don't just talk about it. I've been there.
###4918 Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation. This is not because I didn't
###4922 have commitment to education. It's because I care about education for all of our kids.
###4927 MR. LEHRER: All right, gentlemen, look —
###4927 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Jim, I — (inaudible) —
###4928 MR. LEHRER: Excuse me, one sec — excuse, me sir. (Laughter.) We've got — we've got
###4932 — barely have three minutes left. I'm not going to grade the two of you and say you've
###4936 — your answers have been too long or I've done a poor job —
###4940 PRESIDENT OBAMA: You've done a great job, Jim.
###4941 MR. LEHRER: Oh, well, no. But the fact is, government — the role of government and
###4945 governing, we've lost a (pod ?), in other words, so we only have three minutes left
###4951 in the — in the debate before we go to your closing statements. And so I want to ask finally
###4958 here — and remember, we've got three minutes total time here.
###4963 And the question is this: Many of the legislative functions of the federal government right
###4968 now are in a state of paralysis as a result of partisan gridlock. If elected in your case,
###4976 if re-elected in your case, what would you do about that?
###4979 Governor?
###4980 MR. ROMNEY: Jim, I had the great experience — it didn't seem like it at the time — of
###4984 being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat, and that meant I
###4989 figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get
###4993 anything done. We drove our schools to be number one in the nation. We cut taxes 19
###4997 times.
###4998 MR. LEHRER: Well, what would you do as president?
###4998 MR. ROMNEY: We — as president, I will sit down on day one — actually the day after
###5003 I get elected, I'll sit down with leaders — the Democratic leaders as well as Republican
###5007 leaders and — as we did in my state. We met every Monday for a couple hours, talked
###5011 about the issues and the challenges in the — in the — in our state, in that case.
###5015 We have to work on a collaborative basis — not because we're going to compromise our principle(s),
###5020 but because there's common ground.
###5022 And the challenges America faces right now — look, the reason I'm in this race is there
###5026 are people that are really hurting today in this country, and we face — this deficit
###5030 could crush the future generations. What's happening in the Middle East? There are developments
###5035 around the world that are of real concern. And Republicans and Democrats both love America,
###5042 but we need to have leadership — leadership in Washington that will actually bring people
###5046 together and get the job done and could not care less if it's a Republican or a Democrat.
###5052 I've done it before. I'll do it again.
###5054 MR. LEHRER: Mr. President.
###5055 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney's going to have a busy first
###5057 day, because he's also going to repeal "Obamacare," which will not be very popular among Democrats
###5061 as you're sitting down with them.
###5063 (Laughter.)
###5065 But look, my philosophy has been I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican,
###5072 as long as they're advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and
###5076 giving ladders of opportunity into the middle class. That's how we cut taxes for middle-class
###5081 families and small businesses. That's how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that
###5084 wasn't advancing that cause. That's how we signed three trade deals into law that are
###5089 helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world. That's
###5094 how we repealed "don't ask, don't tell." That's how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised,
###5099 and that's how we're going to wind down the war in Afghanistan. That's how we went after
###5103 al-Qaida and bin Laden.
###5105 So we've — we've seen progress even under Republican control of the House or Representatives.
###5112 But ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to
###5117 describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, I'll sit down, but
###5122 you have to have a plan.
###5124 Number two, what's important is occasionally you've got to say now to — to — to folks
###5130 both in your own party and in the other party. And you know, yes, have we had some fights
###5135 between me and the Republicans when they fought back against us, reining in the excesses of
###5140 Wall Street? Absolutely, because that was a fight that needed to be had. When — when
###5145 we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans had more
###5149 security with their health insurance and they said no, yes, that was a fight that we needed
###5153 to have. And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for,
###5160 but also being willing to say no to some things.
###5162 And I've got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the
###5166 course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the
###5170 more extreme parts of his party.
###5172 MR. LEHRER: That brings us to closing statements. There was a coin toss. Governor Romney, you
###5178 won the toss, and you elected to go last.
###5181 So you have a closing two minutes, Mr. President.
###5184 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, Jim, I want to thank you and I want to thank Governor Romney, because
###5187 I think this was a terrific debate and I very much appreciate it.
###5191 And I want to thank the University of Denver.
###5194 You know, four years ago we were going through a major crisis, and yet my faith and confidence
###5205 in the American future is undiminished. And the reason is because of its people. Because
###5212 of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted
###5217 to inspire her daughter, and now has a new job from that new training that she's gotten.
###5221 Because of the company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for
###5226 their executives to make sure that they didn't lay off workers during a recession. The auto
###5231 workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars
###5236 in the world — not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride,
###5242 that they're helping to build America.
###5244 And so the question now is, how do we build on those strengths? And everything that I've
###5247 tried to do and everything that I'm now proposing for the next four years in terms of improving
###5251 our education system, or developing American energy, or making sure that we're closing
###5257 loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses
###5260 and companies that are creating jobs here in the United States, or — or closing our
###5264 deficit in a responsible, balanced way that allows us to invest in our future — all
###5269 those things are designed to make sure that the American people, their genius, their grit,
###5276 their determination is — is channeled, and — and — and they have an opportunity to
###5283 succeed.
###5283 And everybody's getting a fair shot and everybody's getting a fair share. Everybody's doing a
###5287 fair share and everybody's playing by the same rules.
###5290 You know, four years ago I said that I'm not a perfect man and I wouldn't be a perfect
###5296 president. And that's probably a promise that Governor Romney thinks I've kept. But I also
###5301 promised that I'd fight every single day on behalf of the American people and the middle
###5306 class and all those who are striving to get in the middle class.
###5308 I've kept that promise and if you'll vote for me, then I promise I'll fight just as
###5314 hard in a second term.
###5315 MR. LEHRER: Governor Romney, your two-minute closing.
###5317 MR. ROMNEY: Thank you, Jim and Mr. President. And thank you for tuning in this evening.
###5322 This is a — this is an important election. And I'm concerned about America. I'm concerned
###5326 about the direction America has been taking over the last four years. I know this is bigger
###5332 than election about the two of us as individuals. It's bigger than our respective parties. It's
###5338 an election about the course of America — what kind of America do you want to have for yourself
###5342 and for your children.
###5344 And there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening.
###5347 And over the course of this month we're going to have two more presidential debates and
###5350 vice presidential debate. We'll talk about those two paths. But they lead in very different
###5354 directions. And it's not just looking to our words that you have to take in evidence of
###5359 where they go; you can look at the record.
###5360 There's no question in my mind that if the president were to be re-elected you'll continue
###5364 to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up. I'll get incomes
###5369 up again. You'll see chronic unemployment. We've had 43 straight months with unemployment
###5375 above 8 percent. If I'm president, I will create — help create 12 million new jobs
###5380 in this country with rising incomes.
###5382 If the president's re-elected, "Obamacare" will be fully installed. In my view, that's
###5387 going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan
###5391 they had in the past. Many will lose it. You're going to see health premiums go up by some
###5395 $2,500 per — per family. If I'm elected, we won't have "Obamacare." We'll put in place
###5401 the kind of principles that I put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft
###5405 their own programs to get people insured. And we'll focus on getting the cost of health
###5409 care down.
###5410 If the president were to be re-elected, you're going to see a $716 billion cut to Medicare.
###5416 You'll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare advantage. You'll have hospitals
###5420 and providers that'll no longer accept Medicare patients.
###5423 I'll restore that $716 billion to Medicare.
###5427 And finally, military. If the president's re-elected, you'll see dramatic cuts to our
###5431 military. The secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating. I will not
###5436 cut our commitment to our military. I will keep America strong and get America's middle
###5441 class working again.
###5442 Thank you, Jim.
###5443 MR. LEHRER: Thank you, Governor.
###5444 Thank you, Mr. President.
###5446 The next debate will be the vice presidential event on Thursday, October 11th at Center
###5451 College in Danville, Kentucky. For now, from the University of Denver, I'm Jim Lehrer.
###5456 Thank you, and good night. (Cheers, applause.)
