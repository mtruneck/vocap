1
0:0:15,99 --> 0:0:20,869
Can you achieve balance? I would take people
that believe in nature and let them build


2
0:0:20,869 --> 0:0:28,16
a natural farm, and people believe in science
live in this city. All the cities would be


3
0:0:28,16 --> 0:0:33,52
saner in design, but there'd be different
value systems and you can check them out,


4
0:0:33,52 --> 0:0:41,789
see how it works. If you wanna live on organic
food and you have a community of 40,000 people,


5
0:0:41,789 --> 0:0:48,449
living on organic food, they're all healthier,
but mentally they're not. Physically they're


6
0:0:48,449 --> 0:0:55,269
in perfect shape but mentally, they believe
they've made metaphysical temples and all


7
0:0:55,269 --> 0:1:2,339
that, you know what I mean? So, you might
check out different cultures and say yes they're


8
0:1:2,339 --> 0:1:8,56
all healthy physically, mentally they're aborted.
Do you think you know what I mean? You know


9
0:1:8,56 --> 0:1:19,35
Hitler was a vegetarian don't you? He didn't
believe in eating living things. But his brain


10
0:1:19,35 --> 0:1:26,17
was no better than it was. So if a person
eats nothing but organic food, never had cancer


11
0:1:26,17 --> 0:1:31,1
never had heart disease, but is fucked up
at here, has associative disease, you know


12
0:1:31,1 --> 0:1:39,78
what that means? Doesn't like Swedes, or Catholics,
or gays, that's associate disease. So we don't


13
0:1:39,78 --> 0:1:47,2
measure all of that stuff. A language is an
attempt at controlling the behavior of people.


14
0:1:47,2 --> 0:1:55,759
It isn't a mechanism for controlling behavior,
it's an attempt. People write books cause


15
0:1:55,759 --> 0:2:1,999
they think they can impart their values to
other people, the book is only 1 piece of


16
0:2:1,999 --> 0:2:9,16
the action, and many other things necessary,
conversing with one another, up and back,


17
0:2:9,16 --> 0:2:17,11
disagreements, areas where you're little foggy,
not quite clear. So when I tell you that a


18
0:2:17,11 --> 0:2:22,96
neurologist doesn't know what the problem
is, unless they're social. He has no idea


19
0:2:22,96 --> 0:2:28,33
if he works on the brain there's a study,
how does the brain work? The brain doesn't


20
0:2:28,33 --> 0:2:35,0
work it responds to different cultures. Do
you understand that? Asking a question how


21
0:2:35,0 --> 0:2:43,0
does the brain work? Can not be asked outside
of the culture. You can't do that, it's like


22
0:2:43,0 --> 0:2:51,76
saying, how do we walk? Well, if you lived
on a planet with 1 tenth of gravity, the guy


23
0:2:51,76 --> 0:2:57,16
says let's go for a 20 mile walk you say okay,
because gravity doesn't bother you too much,


24
0:2:57,16 --> 0:3:2,9
but if you live in a planet with 5 times the
gravity of the earth, the guy says wanna walk


25
0:3:2,9 --> 0:3:13,1
a hundred feet? Says that's too much for me,
do you understand by you respond to the environment?


26
0:3:13,1 --> 0:3:20,41
Senators make laws, but they can't change
natural law. They can't change the law of


27
0:3:20,41 --> 0:3:26,56
gravity, at a congress meeting, so it's easier
to go up the steps of the capital. They can't


28
0:3:26,56 --> 0:3:37,58
change natural law, although to a limited
extent we can affect it. So all of us live


29
0:3:37,58 --> 0:3:45,62
within the trap called time and culture. You
know what that means? We live within the trap


30
0:3:45,62 --> 0:3:54,9
called time and culture. So an anthropologist
can't study culture, unless he studies his


31
0:3:54,9 --> 0:4:0,59
own culture, and if he does, he's not gonna
become an anthropologist, becomes a student


32
0:4:0,59 --> 0:4:10,98
of life systems. Maybe, if you know what I
mean? All single professions will disappear


33
0:4:10,98 --> 0:4:17,87
in the future, I've no question about it.
You have to become so general. Encompassing


34
0:4:17,87 --> 0:4:25,44
is a better word than general, cause that
sounds like it's less. I can't use that word


35
0:4:25,44 --> 0:4:36,13
all encompassing. Well, more encompassing,
more encompassing. Emotions get in the way,


36
0:4:36,13 --> 0:4:43,2
because they block you from looking at things
in a more general viewpoint, but when you


37
0:4:43,2 --> 0:4:49,47
like the way you think, that's called arrested
development. You said one time there's no


38
0:4:49,47 --> 0:5:3,2
emotional problems, what did you mean by that?
Well by that I meant there are relating problems,


39
0:5:3,2 --> 0:5:10,49
relating to different things, and you get
hopped up about it, or you get angry, or you


40
0:5:10,49 --> 0:5:16,81
feel depressed, the only way you should feel
depressed, there are real reasons, fairly


41
0:5:16,81 --> 0:5:24,1
depressed if Hitler won the war and they put
you both in solitary confinement, you would


42
0:5:24,1 --> 0:5:33,76
feel depressed, cause there's nothing you
can do about it. If you were around 500 normal


43
0:5:33,76 --> 0:5:41,92
people, they can make you feel depressed.
They can cut you out. But it depends how much


44
0:5:41,92 --> 0:5:48,15
you know about normal people so you don't
let them do that to you. You know how far


45
0:5:48,15 --> 0:5:57,85
you can go, or you think how far you can go.
You'll find out fast enough how far you can


46
0:5:57,85 --> 0:6:7,8
go. When people call up and say what is the
Venus Project? You say have you got 2 weeks?


47
0:6:7,8 --> 0:6:12,72
You can't say this is what it is, oh thank
you very much. It's like answering questions,


48
0:6:12,72 --> 0:6:17,36
you can't answer questions. But you still
have to have a couple of sentences. Yes you


49
0:6:17,36 --> 0:6:22,639
do. Or you can't get around it. If you're
really interested in knowing how people work,


50
0:6:22,639 --> 0:6:29,19
and how they relate to one another and the
environment, get the book, cause you got too


51
0:6:29,19 --> 0:6:35,33
many calls every day to go into detail. After
you get the book, if you've got problems we


52
0:6:35,33 --> 0:6:43,7
can discuss it. You ask a person what do you
want? I want a car. No, they wanna be a certain


53
0:6:43,7 --> 0:6:49,56
place at a given time, that can be done by
television, you know what I mean? You can't


54
0:6:49,56 --> 0:6:56,93
visit your aunt Minnie on a screen full size.
You don't wanna drive to Aunt Minnie's, and


55
0:6:56,93 --> 0:7:3,1
you don't wanna drive to work, you want the
pay cheque. Not every week, when you want


56
0:7:3,1 --> 0:7:9,43
it, right? A guy says I want a job. He doesn't
know what he's talking about, he wants some


57
0:7:9,43 --> 0:7:16,389
money to buy the things he needs. So then
he needs things, not money. You ask a person


58
0:7:16,389 --> 0:7:28,48
what do you want? A decent home, 40,000 dollar
home? 20,000 dollar, what do you mean by decent


59
0:7:28,48 --> 0:7:36,25
home? But in this culture, people really can't
use that kind of logic. They have to think


60
0:7:36,25 --> 0:7:43,31
within. They're incapable. You can give them
a whole new set of tools, and there'll be


61
0:7:43,31 --> 0:7:52,28
people that'll be gunning for you too, cause
you're taking their tools away, or their controls.


62
0:7:52,28 --> 0:8:4,979
So when you say, what does the Venus Project
really think? That's an abstract question,


63
0:8:4,979 --> 0:8:8,96
depends on the situation. Lock your frame
of referent. What? Said lock your frame of


64
0:8:8,96 --> 0:8:17,1
referent. Yeah. A person says what if you
build a Venus Project and a meteor hits it


65
0:8:17,1 --> 0:8:27,41
and destroys it. Then we're fucked. Or we
start over again if we're still around. It's


66
0:8:27,41 --> 0:8:34,56
just a lot of unnecessary aberrant responses.
That's why I would never talk to a psychiatrist,


67
0:8:34,56 --> 0:8:43,79
cause they think they're on the right track.
Although, there are some that know they know


68
0:8:43,79 --> 0:8:48,519
very little about human behavior, you know
there are people like that, that have studied


69
0:8:48,519 --> 0:8:54,97
the field of medicine and really feel that
they don't have much control over health.


70
0:8:54,97 --> 0:9:1,509
And a person says I want a healthy body and
I say what do you want it for? If you're just


71
0:9:1,509 --> 0:9:6,79
healthy so what? I'd rather have a healthy
mind and a warped body. You know what I mean?


72
0:9:6,79 --> 0:9:21,47
But what we talk about is associative systems
that correlate, you know what that means?


73
0:9:21,47 --> 0:9:28,97
With changing conditions.


74
0:9:28,97 --> 0:9:34,199
You know they ask you in school what do you
wanna do with your life? What a stupid question.


75
0:9:34,199 --> 0:9:42,18
What can I do with my life? School doesn't
offer you everything. You got it? You usually


76
0:9:42,18 --> 0:9:47,66
say a healthy associative system correlates
with the real world, but that was good, it


77
0:9:47,66 --> 0:9:52,54
correlates with changing conditions. Yes.
More appropriate huh? Yes. Which is the real


78
0:9:52,54 --> 0:9:58,69
world I guess. But then you've gotta remember,
you're drifting away from the average person,


79
0:9:58,69 --> 0:10:7,36
and you've gotta update your communication,
or try. If you don't work on the people around


80
0:10:7,36 --> 0:10:17,16
you, you will get lost. And they might say
what are you a perfectionist? You know, they


81
0:10:17,16 --> 0:10:28,459
have no other words. A perfectionist is a
guy that died, that's it. You can't be a perfectionist.


82
0:10:28,459 --> 0:10:35,42
You can be particular about things. Just get
away from the holistic words like truth, the


83
0:10:35,42 --> 0:10:45,79
absolute truth, the absolute truth. I said
this before, in order to tell the truth you


84
0:10:45,79 --> 0:10:56,379
have to know everything, to know that which
is true. Okay you guys I'm gonna relax. That


85
0:10:56,379 --> 0:11:6,259
was good Jacque. Thanks Jacque. So that wraps
up this lecture on behavior. He's pretty busy


86
0:11:6,259 --> 0:11:12,73
for a guy his age who needs to be resting
up after about 6 or 7 months of traveling.


87
0:11:12,73 --> 0:11:17,589
He actually has been drawing a lot since he
got back, he did this whole stack in about,


88
0:11:17,589 --> 0:11:23,69
actually 3 times this much but a lot of em
he just rips them up, throws them away. The


89
0:11:23,69 --> 0:11:28,529
usual Venus Project tours which are held on
some Saturdays will resume this month so please


90
0:11:28,529 --> 0:11:34,839
check the website for the dates on those if
you'd like to attend. Since he got back from


91
0:11:34,839 --> 0:11:40,759
traveling he's had a couple of groups, this
particular group was out of Miami and they


92
0:11:40,759 --> 0:11:50,689
have to do with permaculture, and were interested
in the Venus Project. He also had a small


93
0:11:50,689 --> 0:11:57,36
group of 3 or 4 people before them that was
from his original group in Miami when it was


94
0:11:57,36 --> 0:12:6,79
called Sociocyberneering. So thanks for watching
and keep an eye out for more lectures and


95
0:12:6,79 --> 0:14:6,79
other things that we'll be posting soon. Thanks.
There's so much of it.
