part of the job.

5
0:0:35,762 --> 0:0:38,83
HARRY STAFFORD: The first race
of this season at Jerez, I got


6
0:0:38,83 --> 0:0:39,51
a really good start.


7
0:0:39,51 --> 0:0:42,82
I got second into the
first corner.


8
0:0:42,82 --> 0:0:45,26
ROY STAFFORD: He was in a bunch
of four or five riders


9
0:0:45,26 --> 0:0:48,27
at the front and the
next group were


10
0:0:48,27 --> 0:0:50,82
very, very close behind.


11
0:0:50,82 --> 0:0:52,32
He made a slight mistake
at the hairpin.


12
0:0:52,32 --> 0:0:55,19



13
0:0:55,19 --> 0:0:59,82
Nearly high sided, and then
another rider hit him, which


14
0:0:59,82 --> 0:1:3,51
consequently injured him,
breaking his collarbone and


15
0:1:3,51 --> 0:1:4,76
having a severe concussion.


16
0:1:4,76 --> 0:1:9,61



17
0:1:9,61 --> 0:1:14,7
All I could see was what was on
the monitor, and I just saw


18
0:1:14,7 --> 0:1:16,8
number 24 rider crashed.


19
0:1:16,8 --> 0:1:19,55
And I was hoping that it said
then afterwards, rider okay,


20
0:1:19,55 --> 0:1:21,43
but it didn't.


21
0:1:21,43 --> 0:1:24,91
He was very expertly
attended to.


22
0:1:24,91 --> 0:1:26,49
The concussion was the worst.


23
0:1:26,49 --> 0:1:32,11
He had two small blood clots on
the front right-hand lobe


24
0:1:32,11 --> 0:1:32,89
of his brain.


25
0:1:32,89 --> 0:1:35,1
This is what they were
concerned about.


26
0:1:35,1 --> 0:1:38,6
I hadn't slept from Saturday
night, and I


27
0:1:38,6 --> 0:1:41,28
was absolutely shattered.


28
0:1:41,28 --> 0:1:44,195
But when your little boy is
in the hospital, and he's


29
0:1:44,195 --> 0:1:46,99
injured, and he might need
you at any time,


30
0:1:46,99 --> 0:1:48,4
you can't go to sleep.


31
0:1:48,4 --> 0:1:50,28
The bike came over his
shoulder, broke his


32
0:1:50,28 --> 0:1:54,21
collarbone, went up here--
this is Dunlop rubber--


33
0:1:54,21 --> 0:1:56,56
and then glanced off.


34
0:1:56,56 --> 0:1:59,7
So consequently, the helmet
cracked here, because of the


35
0:1:59,7 --> 0:1:59,98
side pressure.


36
0:1:59,98 --> 0:2:2,21
This is the first time I've seen
it since the crash and


37
0:2:2,21 --> 0:2:6,43
it's the first time Harry had
seen it since the crash.


38
0:2:6,43 --> 0:2:9,81
So whether it's brought back
any memories, I don't know.


39
0:2:9,81 --> 0:2:12,63
But I wouldn't have thought so,
because you can't really


40
0:2:12,63 --> 0:2:13,89
remember much.


41
0:2:13,89 --> 0:2:15,82
HARRY STAFFORD: I can't remember
the lights going out


42
0:2:15,82 --> 0:2:17,74
or anything.


43
0:2:17,74 --> 0:2:21,72
Everything was a blank from
near enough a week.


44
0:2:21,72 --> 0:2:26,1
And then the last two days in
hospital, I just barely


45
0:2:26,1 --> 0:2:27,535
remember that.


46
0:2:27,535 --> 0:2:30,48
I just remember pulling
up to the grid.


47
0:2:30,48 --> 0:2:31,46
That's it.


48
0:2:31,46 --> 0:2:33,35
So--


49
0:2:33,35 --> 0:2:36,2
ROY STAFFORD: Yeah, it's taken
him two months to fully


50
0:2:36,2 --> 0:2:37,91
recuperate.


51

But this was on the advice
of Red Bull.

you shouldn't ride.

0:3:7,11 --> 0:3:10,19
not a lot you can do about it.

He wants to race motorcycles
and that's it.


60

The minute he says he doesn't
want to do it anymore, I shall


61

HARRY STAFFORD: My mom is really
nervous because she


70
0:3:45,92 --> 0:3:47,52
thinks there's something
wrong with me now,


71
0:3:47,52 --> 0:3:48,69
because I keep on crashing.


72
0:3:48,69 --> 0:3:53,0
But when you get to ride at this
level, and you have to


73
0:3:53,0 --> 0:3:56,3
push hard to ride with the
front, you start crashing.

And Gusto tells me that whenever
you crash, you learn


75
0:4:0,7 --> 0:4:5,205
from the crash so you know
not to do it next time.

0:10:23,38 --> 0:10:26,22
Out of the picture already
has gone Kornfeil.


204
0:10:26,22 --> 0:10:29,5
Fagerhaug and Brown go
past Kristiansson.


205
0:10:29,5 --> 0:10:33,82
So Fagerhaug now takes it down
to a 1.9 second advantage, and


206
0:10:33,82 --> 0:10:37,2
he's really got Kornfeil
in his sights.


207
0:10:37,2 --> 0:10:40,46
And Fagerhaug goes down,
Fagerhaug goes down and out.


208
0:10:40,46 --> 0:10:44,28
Well, it's an absolute disaster
for the cup leader.


209
0:10:44,28 --> 0:10:47,84
And we're just saying that
before the race that really


210
0:10:47,84 --> 0:10:49,39
Sturla had it all to lose.


211
0:10:49,39 --> 0:10:51,81
He went into this race
with a handsome


212
0:10:51,81 --> 0:10:53,75
40 plus point advantage.


213
0:10:53,75 --> 0:10:56,0
High sided, out of the
race, goes Fagerhaug.


214
0:10:56,0 --> 0:11:2,724



215
0:11:2,724 --> 0:11:6,8
Fastest man on the track,
though, is Hayden Gillim in


216
0:11:6,8 --> 0:11:8,275
sixth place.


217
0:11:8,275 --> 0:11:11,66
He's riding brilliantly in these
tricky wet conditions.


218
0:11:11,66 --> 0:11:13,86
Hayden Gillim in the black
helmet has passed the white


219
0:11:13,86 --> 0:11:17,3
helmet of Danny Kent, and Gillim
now is right there in


220
0:11:17,3 --> 0:11:19,196
the battle for the last
rostrum position.


221
0:11:19,196 --> 0:11:26,6



222
0:11:26,6 --> 0:11:28,73
PETER CLIFFORD: There is Hayden
Gillim, he's now on his


223
0:11:28,73 --> 0:11:30,17
own, though.


224
0:11:30,17 --> 0:11:32,31
Gillim on his own.


225
0:11:32,31 --> 0:11:35,45
So what has happened to Scholtz
and Kristiansson, has


226
0:11:35,45 --> 0:11:37,11
he just ridden away from them?


227
0:11:37,11 --> 0:11:40,38



228
0:11:40,38 --> 0:11:42,98
Ah, no it's Gillim who had the
fall and he's on his own


229
0:11:42,98 --> 0:11:45,82
because he's just got himself
back into action.


230
0:11:45,82 --> 0:11:46,28
DANNY WALKER: Ooh.


231
0:11:46,28 --> 0:11:46,74
Ooh.


232
0:11:46,74 --> 0:11:47,66
Ooh.


233
0:11:47,66 --> 0:11:49,4
That close.


234
0:11:49,4 --> 0:11:50,85
It's called racing, otherwise
it'd be a parade.


235
0:11:50,85 --> 0:11:54,55
You'd just nod and wave.


236
0:11:54,55 --> 0:11:57,65
ROY STAFFORD: Hey,
he's up to 11th.


237
0:11:57,65 --> 0:12:0,36
Yeah, he's riding OK, he's
riding within himself, he's


238
0:12:0,36 --> 0:12:3,43
riding according to the
conditions, not doing anything


239
0:12:3,43 --> 0:12:4,78
stupid, opting out.


240
0:12:4,78 --> 0:12:5,91
PETER CLIFFORD: It's
Kent and Scholtz.


241
0:12:5,91 --> 0:12:9,235
Scholtz goes up the inside
on the brakes


242
0:12:9,235 --> 0:12:11,24
into the tight section.


243
0:12:11,24 --> 0:12:15,47
Here comes Jakub Kornfeil around
the last climbing left


244
0:12:15,47 --> 0:12:19,75
hander, out on to the start and
finish to win his first


245
0:12:19,75 --> 0:12:20,2
Rookies Cup Race.


246
0:12:20,2 --> 0:12:24,35
And down goes Danny Kent, out of
the last corner, down goes


247
0:12:24,35 --> 0:12:24,6
Danny Kent.


248
0:12:24,6 --> 0:12:27,24
And it's Scholtz that
takes second place.


249
0:12:27,24 --> 0:12:29,33
And across the line
comes Jake Gagne.


250
0:12:29,33 --> 0:12:31,23
He didn't expect
that, I'm sure.


251
0:12:31,23 --> 0:12:57,119
[BAND PLAYING]


252
0:12:57,119 --> 0:12:59,26
JAKE GAGNE: Everybody kept going
down, and going down, it


253
0:12:59,26 --> 0:12:59,8
was really slippery.


254
0:12:59,8 --> 0:13:2,737
So I just sat back and let
everybody else scratch,


255
0:13:2,737 --> 0:13:4,866
because I already was too far
back at the beginning, so I


256
0:13:4,866 --> 0:13:6,948
just let everybody go down
and ended up third.


257
0:13:6,948 --> 0:13:8,352
So it's good.


258
0:13:8,352 --> 0:13:18,73



259
0:13:18,73 --> 0:13:20,14
COLLEEN SCHOLTZ: I am
proud of Mathew.


260
0:13:20,14 --> 0:13:23,2
He started eighth on the grid
and worked his way up to


261
0:13:23,2 --> 0:13:27,2
second, and I'm very
pleased for him.


262
0:13:27,2 --> 0:13:27,475
COLLEEN SCHOLTZ:
Nerve wracking.


263
0:13:27,475 --> 0:13:29,46
[LAUGHS].


264
0:13:29,46 --> 0:13:32,7
Especially as you can see him
going, and you just keep


265
0:13:32,7 --> 0:13:33,774
thinking in your head, keep
it smooth, you can


266
0:13:33,774 --> 0:13:35,354
do it, keep it smooth.


267
0:13:35,354 --> 0:13:38,672



268
0:13:38,672 --> 0:14:0,82



269
0:14:0,82 --> 0:14:2,8
ROY STAFFORD: Well, it was
absolutely bang on.


270
0:14:2,8 --> 0:14:4,81
He started from 15th
on the grid.


271
0:14:4,81 --> 0:14:7,22
Rode his own race, rode nice
and steady, quite within


272
0:14:7,22 --> 0:14:10,1
himself, to the track
conditions.


273
0:14:10,1 --> 0:14:12,17
And dash me, he come
home ninth.


274
0:14:12,17 --> 0:14:14,42
So I'm well happy with that.


275
0:14:14,42 --> 0:14:41,288



276
0:14:41,288 --> 0:14:44,14
HAYDEN GILLIM: These
guys are idiots.


277
0:14:44,14 --> 0:14:46,74
HAYDEN GILLIM: I got
a black eye.


278
0:14:46,74 --> 0:14:50,15
STURLA FAGERHAUG: I got some
ice on my lower back, yeah.


279
0:14:50,15 --> 0:14:52,987
I landed straight on my
back, so I'm feeling


280
0:14:52,987 --> 0:14:54,166
a bit of pain there.


281
0:14:54,166 --> 0:14:55,416
HAYDEN GILLIM: I landed
on my head.


282
0:14:55,416 --> 0:14:58,982



283
0:14:58,982 --> 0:15:0,115
HAYDEN GILLIM: Yeah, it is.


284
0:15:0,115 --> 0:15:3,41
GUSTL AUINGER: It
was a race like


285
0:15:3,41 --> 0:15:5,5
professional racers are racing.


286
0:15:5,5 --> 0:15:9,19
And someone was very
lucky today, and


287
0:15:9,19 --> 0:15:10,28
some were not so lucky.


288
0:15:10,28 --> 0:15:12,34
But I'm proud of my boys.


289
0:15:12,34 --> 0:15:15,456
They did a great, great job.


290
0:15:15,456 --> 0:15:19,5
ROY STAFFORD: Well, people often
will say to you, how the


291
0:15:19,5 --> 0:15:23,95
hell can you let your child race
around a circuit at 130


292
0:15:23,95 --> 0:15:29,69
mile an hour, putting
them in danger.


293
0:15:29,69 --> 0:15:32,47
But what they don't
realize is, these


294
0:15:32,47 --> 0:15:35,97
children want to do this.


295
0:15:35,97 --> 0:15:38,91
It is their life,
their passion.


296
0:15:38,91 --> 0:15:41,53
And they are not
forced at all.


297
0:15:41,53 --> 0:15:42,78
Not at all.


298
0:15:42,78 --> 0:17:42,78
