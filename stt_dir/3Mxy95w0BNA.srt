0:0:5,225 --> 0:0:9,6
KRISHNA: Here we are at the
World Cup of Biathlon, which


3
0:0:9,6 --> 0:0:11,81
is being held in Jamtland
this week.


4
0:0:11,81 --> 0:0:13,68
So this is a big sport
here in Jamtland?

a big sport.


6
0:0:14,385 --> 0:0:16,66
CHRIS: Hopefully today
we can give it a go.


7
0:0:16,66 --> 0:0:18,78
And especially with my hangover
after too much


8
0:0:18,78 --> 0:0:20,58
Presidential beer, I
won't make too much


9
0:0:20,58 --> 0:0:21,3
of a mess of myself.


10
0:0:21,3 --> 0:0:24,115
KRISHNA: I can't wait to
see tomorrow Chris.


11
0:0:24,115 --> 0:0:28,28
MALE SPEAKER: Today is
biathlon practice.


12
0:0:28,28 --> 0:0:29,52

0:0:29,52 --> 0:0:30,4
CHRIS: Cool.


14
0:0:30,4 --> 0:0:33,356
MALE SPEAKER: And then we will
go out and do the skiing.


15
0:0:33,356 --> 0:0:34,42
CHRIS: All right, sounds good.


16
0:0:34,42 --> 0:0:35,99
MALE SPEAKER: The green
targets are hits,


17
0:0:35,99 --> 0:0:37,3
red light is a miss.


18
0:0:37,3 --> 0:0:40,56
KRISHNA: And so in real life
is this the distance?


19
0:0:40,56 --> 0:0:43,208
Chris, perfect.


20
0:0:43,208 --> 0:0:44,622
MALE SPEAKER: OK, so winner?


21
0:0:44,622 --> 0:0:45,48

22
0:0:45,48 --> 0:0:47,1
MALE SPEAKER: Now it's
time for skiing.


23
0:0:47,1 --> 0:0:48,3
KRISHNA: All right.


24
0:0:48,3 --> 0:0:50,65
I feel like just get
us on that course.


25
0:0:50,65 --> 0:0:53,89
Men's pursuit, 12:15, that's
going to be us.


26
0:0:53,89 --> 0:0:54,79
CHRIS: We need to warm-up.


27
0:0:54,79 --> 0:0:57,69
KRISHNA: Got to warm-up
for men's pursuit.


28
0:0:57,69 --> 0:0:58,37
Look at this guy.


29
0:0:58,37 --> 0:0:59,57
He's like who the fuck
are these guys?


30
0:0:59,57 --> 0:1:2,4
MALE SPEAKER: Remember to
keep your hands close.


31
0:1:2,4 --> 0:1:3,98
Look at me first.


32
0:1:3,98 --> 0:1:5,86
Bend your knees, pull
down on the poles.


33
0:1:5,86 --> 0:1:9,836



34
0:1:9,836 --> 0:1:10,333
That's it!


35
0:1:10,333 --> 0:1:11,583
That's it!


36
0:1:11,583 --> 0:1:28,722



37
0:1:28,722 --> 0:1:29,716
CHRIS: Oi.


38
0:1:29,716 --> 0:1:31,704
MALE SPEAKER: Ready?


39
0:1:31,704 --> 0:1:33,692
Go!


40
0:1:33,692 --> 0:1:37,745
And we're heading out with
a good start for Chris.


41
0:1:37,745 --> 0:1:41,547
Krishna has gained a half
of the lead two


42
0:1:41,547 --> 0:1:44,36
yards from the start.


43
0:1:44,36 --> 0:1:47,417
And it will be a close finish!


44
0:1:47,417 --> 0:1:48,866
A tactical finish!


45
0:1:48,866 --> 0:1:53,675



46
0:1:53,675 --> 0:1:58,11
And as the referee, I
can still not see


47
0:1:58,11 --> 0:2:0,512
anyone passing the line.


48
0:2:0,512 --> 0:2:3,46
And Krishna goes
over the line.


49
0:2:3,46 --> 0:2:4,79
Winner!


50
0:2:4,79 --> 0:2:7,975
KRISHNA: Yes!


51
0:2:7,975 --> 0:2:10,297
CHRIS: Should get a
little pose here.


52
0:2:10,297 --> 0:2:12,272
KRISHNA: Oh, of course,
of course.


53
0:2:12,272 --> 0:2:14,24
MALE SPEAKER: The winner.


54
0:2:14,24 --> 0:2:16,7
Hooray!


55
0:2:16,7 --> 0:2:19,15
KRISHNA: Thank you sir, I get a
handshake from the President


56
0:2:19,15 --> 0:2:20,73
of Jamtland.


57
0:2:20,73 --> 0:2:21,82
Thank you sir, thank you.


58
0:2:21,82 --> 0:2:23,7
Photo finish.
