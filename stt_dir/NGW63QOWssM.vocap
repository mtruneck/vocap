###0 PROFESSOR: WELCOME BACK. AND I THINK THAT STARTING OUT TODAY
###4 WE SHOULD PROBABLY DECIDE ON A REVIEW SESSION. OKAY, SO HOW MANY
###10 PEOPLE, WE HAVE TO DO IT THIS WEEK BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY NEXT
###13 WEEK THE ROOM'S NOT AVAILABLE. AND SO HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD
###17 LIKE TO DO IT ON WEDNESDAY AT THIS TIME?
###21 STUDENT: WE CAN'T HEAR YOU BACK HERE.
###25 PROFESSOR: OH, OKAY. SO WE NEED TO HOLD A REVIEW SESSION OR I'D
###30 LIKE TO, IT'S NOT OBLIGATORY, BUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO HOLD A
###35 REVIEW SESSION. AND IF WE DID IT ON, WE HAVE TO DO IT EITHER
###38 WEDNESDAY OR FRIDAY OF THIS WEEK. SO HOW MANY FOR WEDNESDAY
###42 AGAIN? OKAY, HOW ABOUT FRIDAY? IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S WEDNESDAY
###48 THEN. SO WE'LL MEET HERE ON WEDNESDAY. AND I'LL CONTINUE TO
###52 HOLD OFFICE HOURS UP TO THE DAY OF THE FINAL. BUT NEXT WEEK
###56 I'LL PROBABLY BE IN, I'LL ARRIVE AT THE OFFICE AND IF NOBODY
###60 SHOWS UP WITHIN ABOUT, BY ABOUT 20 AFTER, I'M PROBABLY GOING TO
###64 LEAVE BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL EVEN BE ON CAMPUS
###67 NEXT WEEK. BUT, SO BE SURE IF YOU COME TO OFFICE HOUR NEXT WEEK
###71 THAT YOU SHOW UP WITHIN THE FIRST 10 MINUTES, LIKE BETWEEN 10
###75 AFTER AND 20 AFTER. AND THE SAME GOES FOR THE DAY OF THE FINAL.
###79 ALL RIGHT, SO LAST TIME I GAVE YOU A BIT OF AN INTRODUCTION TO
###86 THE WHOLE TOPIC OF SIGNALING IN PLANTS, HOW PLANTS CAN ACTUALLY
###92 PERCEIVE STIMULI. WE TALKED ABOUT THE STIMULUS OF LIGHT AND
###98 PHOTOPERIODISM IN PARTICULAR, THAT IS PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES OF
###101 PLANTS TO THE RELATIVE LENGTH OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS WHICH IS
###105 
###105 IMPORTANT WITH REGARD TO FLOWERING IN PARTICULAR IS ONE OF THE,
###109 THE THING WE MAINLY FOCUSED ON. I JUST WANT TO FINISH UP ON
###113 THAT BY POINTING OUT THAT IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THE, THE LENGTH OF
###118 THE DAY THAT'S IMPORTANT BUT IT'S THE UNINTERRUPTED LENGTH OF THE
###123 NIGHT THAT PLANTS ARE ACTUALLY PERCEIVING. AND THIS WAS
###128 ESTABLISHED AFTER THE NAME SHORT-DAY PLANT AND LONG-DAY PLANT
###132 WERE ALREADY INGRAINED IN THE LITERATURE. SO THOSE NAMES
###136 PERSIST FOR PLANTS THAT FLOWER DURING SHORT DAYS AND PLANTS THAT
###140 FLOWER DURING LONG DAYS. AND AS I MENTIONED, THERE'S SOME
###143 PLANTS THAT ARE DAY, DAY NEUTRAL. THEY JUST FLOWER WHENEVER
###146 THEY'RE AT THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATE TO FLOWER. BUT THE
###150 EXPERIMENTS THAT WERE DONE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS IS A, A
###155 NIGHT-LENGTH RESPONSE RATHER THAN A DAY-LENGTH RESPONSE WERE
###157 PRETTY ELEGANT. JUST BASICALLY GROWING PLANTS IN A GREENHOUSE
###161 SITUATION UNDER CONTROLLED LIGHT. AND WITH A SHORT-DAY PLANT
###166 WHICH WOULD NORMALLY FLOWER AFTER THE NIGHT OR AFTER THE DAY
###171 LENGTH WENT BELOW A CERTAIN LEVEL IN THE FALL OR THE LATE SUMMER,
###176 A BRIEF FLASH OF LIGHT WAS INTRODUCED ABOUT MIDWAY THROUGH THE
###180 DARK PERIOD AND THOSE PLANTS THEN WOULD, WOULD FLOWER. SO AND
###186 THE SAME SORT OF THING WAS OBSERVED WITH THE LONG-DAY PLANTS
###190 WHICH TYPICALLY WOULD FLOWER WHEN DAY LENGTH REACHES A CERTAIN
###194 PERIOD OF TIME, THAT FLOWER IN THE LATE SPRING OR EARLY SUMMER.
###198 AND IT TURNED OUT THAT A BRIEF FLASH OF INTENSE LIGHT, JUST THE
###202 BRIEFEST FLASH IN BOTH CASES, WOULD INITIATE FLOWERING EVEN
###208 THOUGH THE DARK PERIOD WAS TOO LONG STILL FOR FLOWERING TO OCCUR
###211 
###212 IN THIS CASE. SO IT APPEARS THAT BASED ON OTHER WORK THAT
###215 PHYTOCHROME ACTUALLY IS INVOLVED HERE, AT LEAST IN PART. IT'S
###218 ONE OF THE PHOTORECEPTORS SENSING THE OVERALL LENGTH OF THE NIGHT
###223 PERIOD. AND WITH THE FLASH OF LIGHT PHYTOCHROME SIGNALS THE END
###228 OF THAT NIGHT PERIOD. SO WITH THE LONG-DAY PLANT, WHICH IS
###232 BASICALLY A SHORT NIGHT PLANT, THAT FLASH OF LIGHT BREAKS UP THAT
###236 LONG DARK PERIOD INTO TWO SHORT PERIODS, AND THE PLANT SENSES IT
###240 AS A SHORT NIGHT AND FLOWERING IS INITIATED. AND HERE WHERE THE
###245 FLASH OF LIGHT IS ALSO INTRODUCED IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT DARK
###248 PERIOD, I ACTUALLY MISSTATED THIS THAT THE, THE SHORT-DAY PLANT
###253 WILL NOT FLOWER BECAUSE THE LONG NIGHT IS NOT PERCEIVED.
###259 INSTEAD IT'S PERCEIVED AS A SHORT NIGHT. SO THESE PLANTS FLOWER
###264 WHEN THE NIGHT LENGTH CROSSES A CRITICAL THRESHOLD, BUT THE FLASH
###268 OF LIGHT CAUSES THE PLANT NOT TO PERCEIVE THAT AS A LONG NIGHT.
###274 WHEREAS HERE THE FLASH OF LIGHT SUGGESTS THIS IS A SHORT NIGHT
###278 WHICH IS WHAT IS REQUIRED FOR LONG-DAY PLANT TO FLOWER. ARE
###281 THERE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT THEN? SO THIS IS A, THIS IS ALL I
###288 REALLY HAD TO SAY ABOUT, WELL, THERE'S ONE MORE THING TO SAY
###291 ABOUT PHOTOPERIODISM, AND IT'S PRETTY INTERESTING. AND THIS
###294 SEGUES INTO THE NEXT TOPIC ABOUT GROWTH REGULATION. AND THAT IS
###300 THAT EXPERIMENTS WERE ALSO DONE WHERE A PLANT THAT WAS IN, WHERE
###304 A FLOWERING HAD BEEN INITIATED, IN THIS CASE A SHORT-DAY PLANT,
###309 HAD A LONG-DAY PLANT SHOOT GRAFTED ON TO IT, SO PHYSICALLY
###314 GRAFTED ONTO THE TISSUES OF THIS SHORT-DAY PLANT. THIS IS A
###318 LONG-DAY PLANT THAT HADN'T FLOWERED AT THE TIME. AND THIS PLANT
###322 
###322 THEN FLOWERED EVEN THOUGH THE DAY LENGTH WASN'T, WASN'T
###327 APPROPRIATE FOR A LONG-DAY PLANT TO FLOWER UNDER THOSE
###330 CONDITIONS. SO THIS KIND OF EXPERIMENT CAN BE DONE THE OTHER
###333 WAY AROUND TOO WITH DRAFTING A SHORT-DAY SHOOT ONTO A LONG-DAY
###338 PLANT THAT HAD ALREADY INITIATED AND IT WOULD FLOWER AT A TIME
###343 WHEN IT NORMALLY WOULDN'T. SO CLEARLY SOMETHING IS BEING
###347 TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE TISSUES OF THIS PLANT THAT'S UNDERGONE
###353 FLOWERING TO THE TISSUES OF ANOTHER, OF THIS OTHER PLANT THAT'S
###356 RESULTING IN INITIATION OF FLOWERING. AND THIS IS, THIS SORT OF
###361 EXPERIMENT DATES LONG AGO, I MEAN FOR NEARLY THREE QUART-, THREE
###367 QUARTERS OF A CENTURY, PEOPLE HAVE POSTULATED ON THE BASIS OF
###373 SUCH DATA THAT THERE'S A FLOWERING HORMONE THAT'S TRANSMITTED
###377 WITHIN PLANTS. THEY'VE EVEN GIVEN IT THE NAME FLORIGEN BUT NO
###381 ONE HAS EVER SUCCESSFULLY ISOLATED THIS HORMONE, SO IT'S STILL A
###384 COMPLETE HYPOTHETICAL IF IT REALLY EXISTS. BUT IT'S STILL CALLED
###389 BY THIS NAME IN THE LITERATURE AND PEOPLE DISCUSS IT AS IF IT
###391 EXISTS. IT'S ONE OF THE MOST, IT'S ONE OF THE STRANGER ASPECTS
###395 OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY. AND IT'S POSSIBLE BASED ON SOME RECENT
###399 EXPERIMENTS IN ARABIDOPSIS WHICH IS A MODEL SYSTEM FOR STUDYING
###404 PLANT BIOLOGY THAT THE STIMULUS MIGHT NOT BE A HORMONE BUT MIGHT
###410 BE A MACROMOLECULE, DN, A PROTEIN OR A NUCLEIC ACID RATHER THAN
###416 A MICROMOLECULE WHICH HORMONES TYPICALLY ARE. SO THAT GETS TO
###423 THE POINT OF PLANT CHEMISTRY. AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT PLANT
###428 CHEMISTRY ONLY IN RELATION TO HOW PLANTS RESPOND TO ENVIRONMENTAL
###432 STIMULI. AND THIS IS A REALLY FASCINATING AREA ABOUT WHICH
###438 
###439 WE'RE LEARNING MORE ALL THE TIME. HUGE AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN
###442 LEARNED SINCE I ACTUALLY TOOK BOTANY AND TAUGHT IT AS A GRADUATE
###446 STUDENT. BUT PLANTS, LIKE ANIMALS, HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS
###451 FOR COPING WITH THE, WITH ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. AND,
###456 OF COURSE, MOST ANIMALS CAN MOVE IN RESPONSE TO EITHER A
###461 FAVORABLE STIMULUS OR AN UNFAVORABLE STIMULUS. THEY CAN EITHER
###464 APPROACH IT OR RETREAT FROM IT. WHEREAS PLANTS THROUGH MOST OF
###469 THEIR LIFE CYCLE ARE IMMOBILE AND ARE LOCKED IN PLACE
###473 ESSENTIALLY, SO THEIR, THEIR RESPONSES REALLY ARE TYPICALLY IN
###477 THE AREA OF GROWTH OR METABOLIC CHANGES. AND PLANT HORMONES ARE
###485 ONE OF THE WAYS THAT THE PLANT CAN SIGNAL THESE, THIS NECESSITY
###491 TO CHANGE, TO UNDERGO SOME KIND OF RESPONSE. AND THESE ARE
###497 OFTEN CALLED PLANT GROWTH REGULATORS BECAUSE THEY DIFFER FROM
###500 ANIMAL HORMONES IN SOME WAYS. THEY SOMETIMES ACT CLOSE TO THE
###504 SOURCE OF PRODUCTION. BUT THEY'RE TYPICALLY TRANSLOCATED WITHIN
###510 THE PLANT OR MOVE WITHIN THE PLANT LIKE AN ANIMAL HORMONE. AND
###514 LIKE ANIMAL HORMONES THEY'RE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS THAT MODIFY OR
###518 CONTROL ONE OR MORE PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES. AND THOSE
###524 PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES OFTEN HAVE TO DO WITH PROMOTING OR
###528 INHIBITING GROWTH. THOUGH THESE ARE RESPONSES LIKE CELL
###533 DIVISION, CELL ELONGATION, OR CELLULAR DIFFERENTIATION OR
###538 MATURATION, THE THREE MAJOR ASPECTS OF GROWTH. AND I JUST
###545 MENTIONED THIS, THEY'RE OFTEN TRANSPORTED FROM THE SITE OF
###547 STIMULUS RECEPTION TO THE SITE OF RESPONSE. AND ONE OF THE
###551 INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT HORMONES IN GENERAL IS THAT THEY, THEY
###554 
###554 CAN BE, THEY CAN HAVE A VERY STRONG EFFECT WITH VERY LOW
###558 CONCENTRATIONS. AND THE AMOUNT OF THE HORMONE PRESENT CAN HAVE
###563 A HUGE EFFECT ON ITS, ON ITS ACTION ON, ON THE SIGNAL THAT IT
###568 PROVIDES TO THE PLANT. AND ALSO THAT ACTION CAN BE AFFECTED BY
###573 THE TYPE OF TISSUE IN WHICH THE HORMONE IS IN CONTACT OR, OR THE
###578 AGE OF THAT TISSUE, ITS STATE OF MATURATION. AND THESE ARE
###585 INVOLVED IN JUST ABOUT EVERY ASPECT OF PLANT GROWTH AND
###588 DEVELOPMENT. AND ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT PLANT
###592 HORMONES THAT MAKES THEM SO DIFFICULT TO STUDY BUT ALSO
###596 FASCINATING IS THAT THERE, AN INDIVIDUAL HORMONE CAN BE INVOLVED
###601 IN MANY DIFFERENT RESPONSES IN PLANTS. AS I JUST MENTIONED, THE
###605 SITE OF ACTION, THE AGE OF THE TISSUE, THE AMOUNT OF HORMONE
###610 PRESENT CAN HAVE A BIG EFFECT ON THE RESPONSE. AND ALSO AN
###615 INDIVIDUAL RESPONSE CAN INVOLVE MULTIPLE HORMONES, DIFFERENT
###618 HORMONES. AND IT'S THE RELATIVE CONCENTRATION OF THESE
###622 DIFFERENT HORMONES THAT'S MOST IMPORTANT GENERALLY, WHAT WE CAN
###626 THINK OF AS HORMONAL BALANCE WHICH IS SOMETHING WE ALSO THINK
###629 ABOUT IN ANIMALS. THOUGH THE HORMONAL BALANCE, WE'LL TALK ABOUT
###633 THAT A COUPLE OF TIMES HERE TODAY, IS REALLY IMPORTANT. SO JUST
###640 LIKE SO MANY THINGS IN BIOLOGY, SOME OF THE EARLIEST INSIGHTFUL
###646 WORK ON THESE, ON PLANT HORMONES WAS DONE BY CHARLES DARWIN IN
###651 ASSOCIATION WITH HIS SON FRANCIS BACK NEAR THE END OF HIS LIFE IN
###654 THE 1880S. AND WHAT THEY DID IS THEY, THEY GREW UP GRASS
###659 SEEDLINGS. AND REMEMBER GRASSES GERMINATE DIRECTLY THROUGH THE
###665 SOIL, THE TIP OF THE SHOOT EMERGES SHEATHED IN A, WHAT'S CALLED A
###669 
###669 COLEOPTILE, THE SHEATH THAT EMERGES DIRECTLY FROM THE, FROM THE
###675 SOIL. AND IT WAS THE BENDING OF THESE COLEOPTILES IN RESPONSE
###680 TO LIGHT THAT, THAT THE DARWINS STUDIED. AND SO THEY FOUND
###685 THAT, THAT THESE COLEOPTILES WOULD BEND TOWARD THE LIGHT WHICH IS
###690 A PRETTY ADAPTIVE RESPONSE IT SEEMED TO IN TERMS OF MAXIMIZING
###695 PHOTOSYNTHESIS. AND SO THEY WANTED TO UNDERSTAND HOW THAT
###698 OCCURRED AND WHAT THAT INVOLVED. SO THEY DID VARIOUS THINGS,
###704 BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THEY DID THAT WAS INTERESTING IS THEY CUT
###707 OFF THE TIP OF THAT COLEOPTILE, AND THEY SAW THAT NO BENDING,
###711 THIS GROWTH RESPONSE THAT RESULTED IN BENDING DIDN'T OCCUR. AND
###717 SO MAYBE THAT WAS JUST SOME SORT OF WOUND RES, A PROBLEM WITH
###721 WOUNDING THE PLANTS. SO THEY COVERED UP THE TIP WITH A, A LIGHT
###724 IMPENETRABLE COVER. AND THEY ALSO SAW NO BENDING. SO THE NEXT
###732 THING THEY TRIED IS THEY COVERED UP THE AREA WHERE THE BENDING
###734 ACTUALLY OCCURS, AND THE THING STILL BENT. SO THEY CONCLUDED
###741 THAT LIGHT IS SENSED BY THE TOP OF THE SHOOT AND THAT, THAT SOME
###750 SORT OF HORMONAL SIGNAL IS SENT DOWN THE, THROUGH THE PLANT TO A,
###756 A POINT OF RESPONSE WHERE THERE'S A GROWTH RESPONSE THAT RESULTS
###759 IN BENDING TOWARD LIGHT. SO THIS WAS THE FIRST EVIDENCE FOR
###763 PLANT HORMONES. AND THIS ELICITED A LOT OF INTEREST BY OTHERS.
###769 AND THERE WERE OTHER EXPERIMENTS DONE WITH THE SAME SYSTEM AFTER
###772 DARWIN. AND ONE OF THEM WAS THIS ONE WHICH ESTABLISHED THAT
###777 THIS PHOTOPTROPIC SIGNAL IS ACTUALLY A CHEMICAL AS DARWIN
###782 SUSPECTED. AND WHAT WAS DONE HERE WAS THAT THE SLICED OFF TIP
###787 OF THE COLEOPTILE IS PLACED ON A LITTLE BLOCK OF AGAR. WE TALKED
###792 
###792 ABOUT AGAR, OF COURSE, IS THE, THIS CARBOHYDRATE EXTRACTED FROM
###796 RED ALGAE. AND IT'S PERMEABLE. THIS WAS PLACED IN BETWEEN THE
###802 REST OF THE COLEOPTILE AND ITS TIP. AND WHAT WAS SEEN IS THIS
###807 GROWTH RESPONSE STILL OCCURRED, WHEREAS IF YOU PUT A PLACE,
###810 WHEREAS IF AN IMPENETRABLE OBJECT WAS PLACED BETWEEN THE TIP AND
###814 THE REST OF THE COLEOPTILE, IN THIS CASE A LITTLE SHEET OF MICA,
###819 THERE WAS NO BENDING. SO THE CONCLUSION FROM THIS EXPERIMENT
###823 WAS THAT INDEED SOME CHEMICAL WAS TRANSMITTED DOWN THROUGH THE,
###827 THROUGH THE COLEOPTILE AS DARWIN SUSPECTED. OKAY, THEN IT
###833 WASN'T UNTIL THE 1920S THAT FRITZ WENT AT CAL TECH PERFORMED A
###841 KIND OF DECISIVE EXPERIMENT HERE WHERE BASICALLY USING THE SAME
###846 SYSTEM, THIS TIP OF THE COLEOPTILE THAT HAD BEEN INITIATED OR HAD
###851 BEEN EXPOSED TO LIGHT AND HAD UNDERGONE SOME EXPOSURE TO LIGHT
###857 WAS CUTOFF AND PLACED AGAIN ON A LITTLE BLOCK OF AGAR WITH A
###863 SUFFICIENT TIME FOR ANY DIFFUSION TO OCCUR INTO THIS AGAR WHICH
###868 WAS SHOWN HERE BY THE RED, THE ACTIVE SUBSTANCE HERE. AND THEN
###875 THIS WAS PLACED ON DIFFERENT COLEOPTILES THAT HAD ALSO HAD THEIR
###880 TOPS, THEIR TIPS EXCISED THAT HADN'T BEEN EXPOSED TO LIGHT. AND
###885 IT WAS PLACED OFFSET TO ONE SIDE, EITHER ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER ON
###890 DIFFERENT COLEOPTILES. AND A GROWTH RESPONSE WAS SEEN WITH
###894 BENDING AWAY FROM THE, THE EDGE THAT THE AGAR WAS PLACED ON.
###900 AND WHEN THE TISSUES OF THOSE COLEOPTILES WAS LOOKED AT IN MORE
###903 DETAIL DOWN NEAR THE AREA OF BENDING, IT WAS, WENT SAW THAT THE
###910 CELLS HAD ELONGATED ALONG THE SIDE THAT THE AGAR WAS PLACED ON.
###915 SO THE IDEA HERE WAS THAT THEN NOT ONLY WAS A CHEMICAL
###919 
###919 TRANSMITTED DOWN HERE, THE CHEMICAL WAS RESULTING IN AN
###923 ELONGATION OF CELLS ALONG THE SIDE OR IN RESPONSE TO THIS
###928 CHEMICAL. AND SO APPARENTLY ON THE DARK SIDE OF THE COLEOPTILE
###934 AWAY FROM LIGHT, THERE WAS, THERE WAS A GROWTH RESPONSE BY THIS
###941 TRANSMITTED CHEMICAL WHICH HE CALLED AUXIN WHICH JUST MEANS TO
###944 INCREASE. IT WASN'T KNOWN WHAT IT WAS AT THE TIME. IT WAS
###948 LATER DISCOVERED TO BE INDOLEACETIC ACID. AND THERE'S SOME
###952 OTHER RELATED SUBSTANCES CALLED AUXINS AS WELL THAT HAVE A NUMBER
###959 OF DIFFERENT RESPONSES. AND SO THIS WAS THE FIRST PLANT HORMONE
###962 THAT WAS REALLY STUDIED, AND IT TURNS OUT TO BE A REALLY
###965 IMPORTANT PLANT HORMONE. AND LIKE OTHER PLANT HORMONES, IT'S
###969 INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT EFFECTS. AND ONE OF THE ONES
###972 WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT IS APICAL DOMINANCE, THAT IS HOW A
###976 SHOOT WILL HAVE A, A PRIMARY APICAL MERISTEM THAT'S ACTIVE
###983 WHEREAS AXILLARY MERISTEMS WILL BE SUPPRESSED, THEY'LL BE
###986 INHIBITED OR WON'T BE ACTIVE. AND IT TURNS OUT AS WE ALREADY
###991 MENTIONED, IF YOU CUT OFF THE TIP, THE ACTIVE TIP OF A SHOOT,
###996 THESE AXILLARY BUDS THAT ARE FOUND IN THE UPPER AXLES OF LEAVES
###1002 HERE WILL SUDDENLY BE INITIATED. AND HERE YOU CAN SEE A LITTLE,
###1007 SOME EVIDENCE OF THIS. THIS TIP WAS JUT CUT OFF. AND HERE GO
###1011 THE AXILLARY BUDS BECOMING NEW SHOOTS THAT ARE GROWING UPWARD
###1015 LIKE THE ORIGINAL TIP. AND ONE TYPICALLY BECOMES DOMINANT. SO
###1023 THAT'S A PRETTY STRONG AND, AND CLEAR RESPONSE TO, TO THE REMOVAL
###1030 OF THE APICAL MERISTEM. AND IT TURNS OUT THAT STUDIES OF THE
###1034 PRESENCE OF AUXIN WITHIN SHOOTS SHOWS THAT THE ACTIVE APICAL
###1039 
###1039 MERISTEM IS WHERE AUXIN IS PRODUCED AT HIGH, RELATIVELY HIGH
###1043 CONCENTRATIONS. AND WITH ITS REMOVAL THEN WE HAVE REMOVAL OF
###1050 WHAT'S ASSUMED TO BE AN, WHAT APPEARS TO BE AN INHIBITOR OF
###1053 THESE, OF THESE SIDE SHOOTS OF THESE AXILLARY BUDS. AND WE'LL
###1059 GET MORE TO THAT IN A MINUTE. SO AS I MENTIONED ALSO AROUND
###1065 THESE PLANT HORMONES HAVE DIFFERENT EFFECTS ON DIFFERENT TISSUES.
###1068 AND ANOTHER COMPLETELY DIFFERENT EFFECT OCCURS WITH AUXIN IN THE
###1074 PRESENCE OF OVARY TISSUE. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S BEEN
###1077 SEEN IS THAT AUXIN IS PRODUCED IN PROXIMITY TO OR PERHAPS BY THE
###1082 SEEDS OF A DEVELOPING OVARY, A DEVELOPING FRUIT. AND HERE WE
###1090 CAN SEE A NORMAL TOMATO WHERE THERE WAS NORMAL POLLINATION AND
###1093 FERTILIZATION WITH THE AUXIN PRODUCED IN THE VICINITY OF THE
###1097 SEEDS BEING IMPORTANT FOR NORMAL FRUIT DEVELOPMENT. AND IN THE
###1101 ABSENCE OF FERTILIZATION OF THOSE SEEDS, IF THERE'S NO
###1104 POLLINATION, THE TOMATO FRUIT WON'T DEVELOP. BUT IF YOU APPLY
###1109 AUXIN, IF YOU SPRAY AUXIN ON THAT OVARY, EVEN IF THERE'S NO
###1112 POLLINATION, THE OVARY CAN DEVELOP, AND THIS IS DONE TO ENSURE
###1116 FRUIT DEVELOPMENT IN TOMATOES AND SOME OTHER FRUITS IN THE
###1121 ABSENCE OF ANY POLLINATORS. SO AUXIN DOES HAVE THIS ABILITY,
###1127 THIS, THIS SIGNALING FOR FRUIT DEVELOPMENT. THOUGH AGAIN, AUXIN
###1134 IS INVOLVED IN CELL ELONGATION, NOT DIVISION, BUT ELONGATION IN
###1141 COLEOPTILES ON THE DARK SIDE OF THE SHOOT, ON STEMS ON THE LIGHT
###1143 SIDE IT TURNS OUT. SO THOSE EXPERIMENTS BY DARWIN AND OTHERS
###1147 WERE A LITTLE BIT MISLEADING. AUXIN OPERATES IN SLIGHTLY
###1150 DIFFERENT WAYS IN STEMS BUT ALSO IN REGARD TO ELONGATION OF
###1154 
###1154 CELLS. IT ALSO OPERATES IN APICAL DOMINANCE, FRUIT DEVELOPMENT,
###1159 AND IN LATERAL ROOT FORMATION, FORMATION OF BRANCHING FROM THE
###1162 ROOTS AS I'LL TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT. ALL RIGHT, SO ANOTHER
###1170 POINT THAT I MADE EARLIER JUST BRIEFLY WAS THAT DIFFERENT
###1172 CONCENTRATIONS OF HORMONES CAN HAVE REALLY DIFFERENT EFFECTS ON
###1176 THE TISSUES THAT THEY'RE IN CONTACT WITH. AND THIS IS THE CASE
###1181 WITH AUXIN, AS YOU CAN SEE HERE'S A GRADIENT OF AUXIN FROM LOW TO
###1185 HIGH CONCENTRATION, HIGHER IN THIS DIRECTION. AND HERE WE CAN
###1191 SEE A POSITIVE EFFECT OF GROWTH EFFECT AND AN INHIBITORY EFFECT
###1194 OF AUXIN WITH NO EFFECT HERE. SO WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS THAT
###1200 DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE PLANT ARE SENSITIVE TO DIFFERENT
###1203 CONCENTRATIONS. BUT IN EACH CASE THERE'S A, A RESPONSE THAT'S
###1211 QUITE SIMILAR AS AUXIN IS INCREASED BUT AT DIFFERENT LEVELS. SO
###1215 WE INITIALLY GET AN INCREASE IN GROWTH BUT THEN AN INHIBITION OF
###1218 GROWTH. AND IF WE LOOK AT THIS IN STEMS, YOU CAN SEE THE
###1223 CONCENTRATION OF AUXIN THAT'S MAXIMALLY STIMULATIVE OF STEM
###1227 GROWTH IS STRONGLY INHIBITING OF BUD GROWTH, OF THOSE AXILLARY
###1231 BUDS AS THAT EXPERIMENT WITH CUTTING OFF THE TIP SHOWED. AND,
###1237 OF COURSE, THE STEM TIP IS PRODUCING A LOT OF AUXIN, SO YOU CUT
###1240 OFF THAT TIP, THE AMOUNT OF AUXIN IS REDUCED IN THE STEM. AND
###1246 WE END UP WITH MAXIMAL INITIATION OF BUDS AND SUPPRESSION OF
###1251 ROOTS AT THAT LEVEL. STEMS AREN'T EVEN EFFECTED AT THE LEVEL
###1255 THAT INITIATES BUD GROWTH IN TERMS OF THE MAIN STEM. SO,
###1263 QUESTION? YEAH, BRAD?
###1263 STUDENT: IS AUXIN JUST KIND OF A GENERIC TERM FOR THE FAMILY OF
###1268 
###1268 HORMONES.
###1269 PROFESSOR: THAT'S RIGHT. YEAH, IT'S JUST A GENERIC TERM. IT'S
###1273 NOT SPECIFIC AS TO CHEMISTRY IN PARTICULAR, THAT'S RIGHT.
###1281 CYTOKININS ARE, WERE DISCOVERED MUCH LATER IN THE 1940S, BUT
###1288 THEY'RE ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT. AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THE
###1291 BALANCE OF CYTOKININ TO AUXIN IS, IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR A PLANT
###1296 TO, FOR THE PLANT GROWTH RESPONSE. AND SO CYTOKININS ARE NAMED
###1302 BECAUSE THEY PROMOTE CELL DIVISION. AND CYTOKININ COMES FROM
###1307 CYTOKINESIS OR CELL DIVISION. OKAY, SO THAT'S AN EASY WAY TO
###1311 REMEMBER THE TERM. REMEMBER THAT AUXINS PROMOTE ELONGATION OF
###1316 CELLS, NOT DIVISION OF CELLS, SO CYTOKININS OPERATING WITH AUXINS
###1322 ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE OVERALL GROWTH RESPONSE SINCE BOTH DIVISION
###1325 AND ELONGATION ARE IMPORTANT IN GROWTH. AND SO A HIGH
###1330 CYTOKININ:AUXIN RATIO PROMOTES ACTIVATION OF, OF SHOOT BRANCHING,
###1337 THIS AXILLARY BUD BRANCHING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT. AND THE, A
###1342 LOW CYTOKININ:AUXIN RATIO PROMOTES ACTIVATION OF LATERAL ROOTS,
###1347 SO BRANCHING OF THE ROOTS. AND I MENTIONED THAT AUXIN CAN
###1352 STIMULATE LATERAL ROOT PRODUCTION. AND IT'S REALLY THE LOW
###1356 CYTOKININ:AUXIN RATIO THAT PROMOTES THAT RELATIVELY HIGH AUXIN
###1360 COMPARED TO CYTOKININ HERE. SO I ALREADY MENTIONED THIS THAT
###1367 CYTOKININ PROMOTES DEVELOPMENT OF BRANCHES FOR, ACTUALLY I DIDN'T
###1371 MENTION THAT. I MENTIONED THAT THE REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF
###1374 AUXIN RESULTS IN THE BRANCHING OF THE SIDE SHOOTS. BUT WHAT IT
###1381 REALLY IS IS THAT THE CYTOKININ RATIO, THERE'S A HIGH
###1385 CYTOKININ:AUXIN RATIO WHEN, AFTER THE TIP IS REMOVED. AND
###1389 
###1389 THAT'S, THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT WITH REGARD TO THE OVERALL
###1393 BRANCHING OF THE SHOOT. AND INTERESTINGLY, THE, THE CYTOKININS
###1402 AND AUXINS ARE PRODUCED IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE PLANT BODY,
###1405 AND THEY'RE, THEY'RE MOBILIZED. THEY MOVE IN OPPOSITE
###1409 DIRECTIONS IN THE PLANT. SO THE AUXIN IS MOVING AS I MENTIONED
###1413 FROM THE SHOOT TIPS DOWNWARD, AND IT STILL MOVES TOWARD THE ROOTS
###1419 EVEN IF YOU TURN THE PLANT UPSIDE-DOWN. THIS IS NOT A GRAVITY
###1422 RESPONSE. AND CYTOKININS ARE TYPICALLY PRODUCED IN THE ROOTS
###1428 AND TRANSPORTED UPWARD TOWARD THE SHOOT. AND SO THIS CREATES A
###1433 GRADIENT OF CYTOKININ AND AUXIN WITHIN THE PLANT BODY THAT'S
###1437 IMPORTANT IN MAINTAINING THIS HORMONAL BALANCE ACROSS THE PLANT.
###1443 OKAY, SO THAT'S, THAT'S ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS THAT WAS
###1445 DISCOVERED ABOUT, ABOUT THIS INTERPLAY BETWEEN CYTOKININS AND
###1449 AUXINS IS THEIR DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT IS DIFFERENT, THEIR PLACE
###1452 OF PRODUCTION IS DIFFERENT, AND THAT HELPS TO SET UP THIS
###1455 GRADIENT THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IN GROWTH. ALL RIGHT, SO
###1461 CYTOKININS THEN IMPORTANT IN CELL DIVISION AND DIFFERENTIATION
###1465 IN CONCERT WITH, WITH AUXINS INVOLVED IN CELL ELONGATION FOR THE
###1469 OVERALL GROWTH RESPONSE, AND ALSO AXILLARY BUD GROWTH,
###1478 PARTICULARLY WHEN APICAL DOMINANCE IS REMOVED BY DAMAGE TO THE
###1481 SHOOT TIP. BUT ALSO, FOR EXAMPLE, AT LOWER POINTS ON THE STEM
###1486 WHERE YOU HAVE A HIGHER CYTOKININ:AUXIN RATIO, AS YOU, AS YOU GET
###1491 FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM THE SHOOT TIP, THERE'S LESS
###1494 INHIBITION OF BUDS TYPICALLY. ALL RIGHT, ANOTHER CLASS OF,
###1500 THIRD CLASS OF PLANT HORMONES ARE CALLED GIBBERELLINS. AND
###1504 
###1504 THESE ARE CALLED GIBBERELLINS BECAUSE THEY WERE ORIGINALLY
###1508 DISCOVERED IN A PLANT THAT WAS INFECTED BY A FUNGUS CALLED
###1512 GIBBERELLA. IT'S JUST AN ASIDE, BUT THAT'S WHERE THE NAME COMES
###1516 FROM. AND THIS FUNGUS PRODUCED A COMPOUND THAT WE CALLED
###1522 GIBBERELLIN THAT RESULTED IN RICE SEEDLINGS BEING STRONGLY, BEING
###1527 VERY SPINDLY, HAVING AN UNCONTROLLED GROWTH RESPONSE. AND SO,
###1533 SO GIBBERELLINS HAVE A STRONG EFFECT IN STEM ELONGATION AND
###1539 OVERALL HAVE A STRONG GROWTH STIMULATING EFFECT. SO THESE ARE
###1543 SUBSTANCES WHICH TEND TO HAVE A STRONG GROWTH STIMULATING EFFECT.
###1547 THEY'RE ALSO IMPORTANT IN PROMOTING SEED GERMINATION, SO THE
###1551 BREAKING OF DORMANCY IN SEEDS, IN, ESPECIALLY PLANTS THAT HAVE A
###1555 LIGHT REQUIREMENT FOR GERMINATION. AND WE USE GIBBERELLINS ALL
###1559 THE TIME AT LOW REALLY CONCENTRATIONS TO GERMINATE SEEDS OF
###1564 CERTAIN PLANT SPECIES IN MY LAB. AND YOU CAN GO FROM A PLANT
###1569 THAT YOU CAN BARELY GET TO GERMINATE, YOU HAVE TO DISSECT THE
###1572 EMBRYOS OUT TO GET THEM TO GERMINATE, TO HAVING THEM ALMOST JUMP
###1576 OUT OF THE SEEDS. I MEAN JUST WITHIN LESS THAN 12 HOURS THEY'LL
###1579 BE FULLY GERMINATED. SO THESE HAVE A PRETTY STRONG EFFECT WHEN,
###1585 IN PLANTS THAT RECOGNIZE THEM FOR, AS A STIMULUS FOR GERMINATION.
###1593 AND THEY'RE ALSO USED COMMERCIALLY TO PROMOTE FRUIT ENLARGEMENT
###1595 AND BUNCH LENGTH IN SEEDLESS GRAPES. WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT HOW
###1600 AUXIN CAN STIMULATE THE INITIATION OF GROWTH OF FRUIT
###1605 DEVELOPMENT. AND GIBBERELLINS CAN ACTUALLY RESULT IN LARGER
###1608 FRUITS. HERE'S A, A BUNCH OF GRAPES THAT WEREN'T TREATED WITH A
###1612 GIBBERELLIN SPRAY. AND HERE ARE SOME THAT WERE TREATED WITH A
###1616 
###1616 GIBBERELLIN SPRAY. SO GIBBERELLINS HAVE A LOT OF USES. AND
###1625 THEY ALSO CAN BE PRODUCED BY PLANTS IN, AS A WOUND RESPONSE AND
###1630 CAN PROMOTE HEALING IN RESPONSE TO WOUNDING. THEY HAVE A NUMBER
###1634 OF RESPONSES. WE'RE JUST SORT OF SCRATCHING THE SURFACE HERE IN
###1636 TERMS OF SOME OF THE MORE OUTSTANDING FUNCTIONS. AND YOU'VE
###1642 PROBABLY SEEN BOLTING OCCUR BEFORE IN HERBS THAT, HERBS THAT JUST
###1648 HAVE BASAL LEAVES UNTIL THEY START TO PRODUCE A FLOWERING SHOOT.
###1652 AND THE PRODUCTION OF A FLOWERING SHOOT CAN HAPPEN REALLY
###1654 QUICKLY, SO QUICKLY THAT IT'S CALLED BOLTING. AND THIS IS
###1657 SOMETHING THAT'S STIMULATED BY GIBBERELLIC ACID AS WELL. AND
###1667 WHEN I ACTUALLY WAS A GSI IN A CLASS LIKE THIS MANY YEARS AGO, WE
###1672 DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT THESE COMPOUNDS, THESE BRASSINOSTEROIDS.
###1676 THESE HAVE JUST BEEN RECENTLY DISCOVERED TO BE PLANT HORMONES.
###1679 AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY STEROIDS SIMILAR TO, TO ANIMAL SEX HORMONES
###1683 IN TERMS OF THEIR OVERALL CHEMISTRY. BUT THEY'RE SO SIMILAR IN
###1687 FUNCTION TO AUXIN IN TERMS OF PROMOTING ELONGATION OF STEMS THAT
###1691 THEY WEREN'T RECOGNIZED AS DISTINCT FROM AUXIN. AND IT'S PLANTS
###1697 LIKE THESE THAT ALLOW THEM TO BE RECOGNIZED. THESE ARE, THESE
###1701 PLANTS ARE ONES, THESE LITTLE DWARF ONES HERE ARE ONES THAT HAVE
###1705 MINIMAL INTERNODAL ELONGATION AND HAPPEN TO BE MUTANTS THAT DON'T
###1711 PRODUCE BRASSINOSTEROIDS. AND THIS NAME BRASSINOSTEROIDS COMES
###1715 FROM THE FACT THAT THESE WERE DISCOVERED IN ARABIDOPSIS WHICH IS
###1719 THE MODEL SYSTEM FOR PLANT BIOLOGY AND IT'S IN THE BRASSICACEAE
###1723 FAMILY OR THE MUSTARD FAMILY. JUST AN ASIDE. BUT THAT'S WHAT
###1727 THE NAME COMES FROM. SO JUST TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THESE ARE
###1731 
###1731 STILL BEING DISCOVERED. THIS WAS A FAIRLY RECENT DISCOVERY,
###1736 SIMILAR TO AUXIN. AND THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PLANT HORMONE,
###1743 ABSCISSIC ACID. WE JUST CALL IT ABA. THIS ACTUALLY WORKS
###1750 ANTAGONISTICALLY TO GIBBERELLINS. AND THE RELATIVE BALANCE OF
###1755 GIBBERELLINS AND ABA CAN BE IMPORTANT IN THE GROWTH RESPONSE.
###1760 SO I MENTIONED GIBBERELLINS HAVE A REALLY STRONGLY STIMULATIVE
###1763 EFFECT TO GROWTH AND SEED GERMINATION WHEREAS, ABSCISSIC
###1769 ACID IS JUST THE OPPOSITE. IT'S IMPORTANT, IT HAS AN INHIBITING
###1773 EFFECT ON STEM GROWTH. AND IT'S IMPORTANT IN INDUCING SEED
###1778 DORMANCY AND PREPARING THE SEED FOR DESICCATION AS THE SEED
###1783 MATURES. SO DORMANCY IN SEEDS IS USUALLY OFTEN RESPONSIBLE,
###1789 ABSCISIC ACID'S OFTEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT. AND IT REQUIRES
###1794 LONG PERIODS OF COLD OR SOME OTHER STIMULUS TO BREAK DOWN ABA AND
###1799 RELEASE THE PLANT FROM THAT DORMANCY CONDITION. INTERESTINGLY,
###1805 THERE ARE SOME PLANTS THAT DON'T PRODUCE MUCH ABA IN THEIR SEEDS
###1808 AND DON'T HAVE DORMANCY. MANGROVES ARE REALLY NOTABLE IN THIS
###1812 SENSE. THEY GERMINATE WHILE THEY'RE STILL ON THE PARENT PLANT.
###1815 HERE YOU CAN SEE THE RADICLES, EMBRYONIC ROOTS EMERGING FROM
###1821 SEEDS STILL IN THE FRUITS OF A MANGROVE THAT HAVEN'T BEEN DROPPED
###1824 YET FROM THE PARENT PLANT. AND THIS KIND OF PRECOCIOUS
###1828 GERMINATION IS IMPORTANT FOR THE SURVIVAL OF MANGROVES. AND IT
###1832 JUST SO HAPPENS THAT THOSE SEEDS ARE REALLY LACKING IN ABSCISIC
###1836 ACID.
###1841 ANOTHER THING THAT ABA DOES THAT HAS A GROWTH INHIBITING
###1844 EFFECT BUT IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT FOR THE SURVIVAL OF A PLANT IS
###1848 THAT ABA WILL SIGNAL THE CLOSURE OF THE GUARD CELLS AND THE
###1853 
###1853 CLOSURE OF THE STOMATES, STOMATA IN, IN RESPONSE TO WILTING OR
###1858 ANY KIND OF DROUGHT STRESS THAT MIGHT BE PERCEIVED IN THE ROOTS.
###1861 ABA WILL BE TRANSMITTED, FOR EXAMPLE, TO THE ROOTS, TO THE SHOOT
###1865 BEFORE IT STARTS TO WILT. AND THIS SETS IN MOTION THE RELEASE
###1870 OF, OF POTASSIUM IONS FROM THE GUARD CELLS. SO THE SOLUTE
###1876 CONCENTRATION IS REDUCED IN THE GUARD CELLS, AND WATER MOVES OUT
###1881 OF THE GUARD CELLS THROUGHOUT, BASED ON OSMOTIC RESPONSE. SO
###1886 THAT'S, THAT'S CRUCIAL FOR PLANTS TO, TO KEEP THEIR WATER BALANCE
###1895 INTACT. AND ABA IS THE IMPORTANT CHEMICAL SIGNAL IN THIS
###1900 REGARD. SO AGAIN, ABSCISSIC ACID'S IMPORTANT FOR DORMANCY,
###1906 CLOSING A STOMATA, AND IN GENERAL IT'S A GROWTH INHIBITOR. AND
###1910 IT'S THIS BALANCE OF ABA AND GIBBERELLINS THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
###1914 IN MANY CASES. ALL RIGHT, SO ETHYLENE IS A SUBSTANCE THAT WAS
###1925 ONLY RECOGNIZED TO BE A PLANT GROWTH REGULATOR RELATIVELY LATE.
###1929 AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT FUNCTIONS IN THE GAS PHASE, WHICH IS A
###1935 BIZARRE THING FOR A HORMONE TO DO. BUT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT
###1941 MOLECULE FOR SIGNALING THE ONSET OF, FOR EXAMPLE, LEAF SENESCENCE
###1945 AND ABSCISSION IN DECIDUOUS PLANTS LIKE A DECIDUOUS HARDWOOD
###1950 TREES. AND DECIDUOUS PLANTS HAVE WHAT'S CALLED AN ABSCISSION
###1955 LAYER. IT'S A LITTLE LAYER OF PARENCHYMA AT THE BASE OF THE
###1959 LEAF. THERE ARE NO FIBERS, SCLERIFIED CELLS THAT CROSS THROUGH
###1964 THAT ZONE, SO THESE ARE JUST LIVING CELLS THAT HAVE RELATIVELY
###1970 THIN CELL WALLS. AND ETHYLENE WHEN IT'S PRODUCED, WHAT HAPPENS
###1974 FIRST IS THAT IT ACTUALLY RESULTS IN A PROGRAMMED DEATH OF CELLS
###1980 INSIDE THE LEAF. SO THE LEAF WILL UNDERGO THIS PROCESS WHERE
###1983 
###1983 THE NUTRIENTS THAT ARE ENCLOSED OR CONTAINED WITHIN THAT LEAF ARE
###1989 MOBILIZED BY THE BREAKDOWN OF SUBSTANCES IN THE LEAF. AND THEN
###1994 THOSE ARE MOVED BACK INTO THE MAIN BODY OF THE PLANT. AND THEN
###1998 THE ABSCISSION LAYER CHANGES START TO OCCUR THERE WHERE ETHYLENE
###2005 WILL STIMULATE THE PRODUCTION OF ENZYMES THAT BREAK DOWN THE CELL
###2009 WALLS OF THOSE PARENCHYMA CELLS IN THAT ABSCISSION LAYER SUCH
###2012 THAT EVENTUALLY THE LEAF WILL JUST FALL OFF BASED ON ITS OWN
###2015 WEIGHT OR BASED ON WIND. AND THEN CORK WILL FORM OVER THAT
###2020 WOUND, SO THAT PREVENTS INFECTION OF THE PLANT. SO ETHYLENE HAS
###2026 A REALLY IMPORTANT EFFECT IN, IN PROGRAMMED CELL DEATH THAT CAN
###2030 BE IMPORTANT IN CAPTURING BACK THE NUTRIENTS THAT A PLANT NEEDS
###2034 FROM TISSUES THAT ARE GOING TO BE DISCARDED. AND IT ALSO HAS A
###2042 REALLY IMPORTANT EFFECT IN FRUIT RIPENING. SO ETHYLENE IS
###2046 CRUCIAL IN FRUIT RIPENING RESPONSE. SO IT'S INVOLVED IN BOTH
###2052 THE ENZYMATIC BREAKDOWN OF THE CELL WALLS. I MEAN IT SIGNALS
###2056 THE ENZYMATIC, PRODUCTION OF ENZYMES THAT BREAKDOWN THE CELL
###2059 WALLS OF, IN THE FRUIT WHICH MAKES THE FRUIT SOFT, INEDIBLE IN
###2064 THAT SENSE. AND IT ALSO SIGNALS THE ENZYMES OR IT, IT
###2073 RESULTS IN THE PRODUCTION OF ENZYMES THAT CONVERT STARCH TO
###2075 SUGAR, SO MAKES THE FRUIT SWEET AS WELL SO THE FRUIT BECOMES
###2082 ATTRACTIVE TO ANIMALS AND, THAT DISPERSE THE SEEDS AS A RESULT.
###2088 AND THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW CASES IN BIOLOGY OF A POSITIVE
###2091 FEEDBACK MECHANISM WHERE THE PRODUCTION OF ETHYLENE LEADS TO
###2095 RIPENING. RIPENING THEN TRIGGERS MORE ETHYLENE PRODUCTION. SO
###2099 THIS ETHYLENE PRODUCTION IS INCREASED. AND AS A GAS, ETHYLENE
###2104 
###2104 PRODUCED BY ONE FRUIT CAN TRIGGER THE RIPENING OF OTHER FRUIT IN
###2107 CLOSE PROXIMITY, ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE IN CLOSED CONTAINERS LIKE
###2111 A PAPER BAG, FOR EXAMPLE. SO YOU'VE KNOW DOUBT HAD THAT
###2115 EXPERIENCE WHERE ONE FRUIT CAN CAUSE THE, ONE RIPE FRUIT CAN, CAN
###2119 BE IMPORTANT WITH REGARD TO THE RIPENING OF OTHERS. AND SO
###2124 ETHYLENE SINCE IT WAS DISCOVERED AS BEING IMPORTANT IN THIS
###2129 REGARD, IT'S USED COMMERCIALLY TO ALLOW FOR THE PICKING OF FRUIT
###2133 WHEN IT'S STILL UNRIPE AND TRANSPORTING IT WHILE IT'S UNRIPE SO
###2138 IT'S NOT DAMAGED DURING TRANSPORT AND THAT IT LASTS. AND THEN
###2142 ETHYLENE GAS IS APPLIED AFTER TRANSPORTATION OR AFTER THE FRUIT'S
###2147 READY TO BE MARKETED AND THE FRUIT WILL START RIPENING AT THAT
###2150 POINT. AND YOU CAN STORE FRUIT FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME, FOR
###2153 MANY MONTHS IN AN UNRIPE STATE AS LONG AS YOU CAN CONTROL THE
###2158 ETHYLENE PRODUCTION BY THE FRUIT. AND SO THERE ARE VARIOUS
###2163 FILTRATION SYSTEMS THAT COMMERCIAL, THAT ARE COMMERCIALLY
###2167 AVAILABLE TO REMOVE ETHYLENE. CARBON DIOXIDE'S ALSO APPLIED TO
###2172 REMOVE ETHYLENE, SO THAT'S, THIS IS AN IMPORTANT COMMERCIAL
###2179 SUBSTANCE AS WELL. OKAY. SO ETHYLENE THEN IS REALLY IMPORTANT
###2186 IN BOTH LEAF ABSCISSION AND FRUIT RIPENING AMONG OTHER THINGS.
###2195 SO THAT'S REALLY ALL I WANT TO SAY ABOUT PLANT HORMONES PER SE.
###2200 WE CAN JUST SUMMARIZE THEM HERE. OF COURSE THEY CAN HAVE A
###2202 VARIETY OF EFFECTS DEPENDING ON THE SITE OF ACTION, CONCENTRATION
###2207 OF THE HORMONE, FOR EXAMPLE. AND THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT I'M
###2215 SAYING HERE. DIFFERENT PLANT PARTS HAVE DIFFERENT SENSITIVITIES
###2218 AND DIFFERENT CONCENTRATIONS. SO THIS WHOLE NOTION OF
###2223 
###2223 DIFFERENTIAL SENSITIVITY IS REALLY IMPORTANT. AND FINALLY THE,
###2230 THEY OFTEN ACT TOGETHER. AND THIS, I'VE ALREADY MENTIONED THIS
###2233 WITH REGARD TO AUXIN AND CYTOKININS WORKING TOGETHER, THIS
###2239 HORMONE BALANCE IN REGARD TO THOSE TWO AND THEN THE BALANCE IN
###2241 REGARD TO GIBBERELLINS AND ABA. SO THIS MAKES THEM REALLY
###2248 DIFFICULT TO STUDY, OF COURSE. IT'S, IT'S A MORE, IN MANY WAYS
###2252 MORE DIFFICULT THAN STUDYING ANIMAL HORMONE ACTION. AND THERE'S
###2256 A LOT OF ACTIVITY STILL GOING ON IN TERMS OF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND
###2260 HOW PLANT HORMONES OPERATE. BUT IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT HORMONAL
###2266 BALANCE IS SUPER IMPORTANT IN PLANTS. OKAY, SO IN THE LAST FEW
###2273 MINUTES I JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT PLANT CHEMISTRY CAN ALSO BE
###2277 REALLY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF PLANT DEFENSE. AND, OF COURSE,
###2281 PLANTS ARE IN A, A REAL BIND WHEN IT COMES TO DEFENDING
###2285 THEMSELVES WHEN THEY CAN'T GET UP AND MOVE. THEY CAN'T WARD OFF
###2288 AN ENEMY OR AN ATTACKER BY GETTING AWAY FROM IT. SO THEY HAVE
###2296 EVOLVED A NUMBER OF REALLY AMAZING STRATEGIES. AND I'VE JUST
###2302 BROKEN THESE INTO MICROBIAL ATTACK VERSUS ATTACK OF A
###2306 MACRO HERBIVORE. BUT IN TERMS OF SAY A BACTERIUM OR A FUNGUS THAT
###2314 SAY MIGHT INVADE THE TISSUE THROUGH THE STOMATA WHICH IS AN
###2318 OPENING, A NATURAL OPENING THAT PLANTS HAVE TO KEEP OPEN BUT IT
###2322 DOES MAKE THEM VULNERABLE, THE CUTICLE CAN WARD OFF A LOT OF
###2328 MICROBES, BUT THE STOMATES ARE ONE PLACE WHERE THEY CAN BE
###2331 ATTACKED. A PARTICULAR MICROBE ENTERING THROUGH THE STOMATES
###2337 CAN BE RECOGNIZED BY PLANTS. AND THERE ARE PROTEINS THAT ARE
###2341 PRODUCED BY PLANT PATHOGENS, DISEASE-CAUSING AGENTS THAT, WHERE
###2347 
###2347 WE HAVE ESSENTIALLY AN ARMS RACE GOING ON BETWEEN THE ATTACKER
###2352 AND THE PLANT IN TERMS OF THE PLANT'S ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE THAT
###2356 ATTACKER, SO MUCH LIKE WE DO IN TERMS OF DISEASE RESPONSE. AND
###2362 PLANTS, IF THEY RECOGNIZE THE ATTACKER, THEY OFTEN HAVE A VERY
###2367 LOCAL AND SPECIFIC RESPONSE TO THAT PARTICULAR AGENT. AND THEY
###2372 CAN PRODUCE A NATURAL PESTICIDE THAT WILL BE DEADLY TO THAT
###2378 PARTICULAR AGENT. AND AT THE SAME TIME THEY CAN UNDERGO
###2383 PROGRAMMED CELL DEATH IN THE REGION OF THAT ATTACK. SO THEY CAN
###2388 WALL OFF THAT PART OF THEIR, THEIR BODY THAT'S BEING ATTACKED BY
###2392 A MICROBE AND AT THE SAME TIME THAT THEY'RE ATTACKING IT WITH A
###2397 NATURAL PESTICIDE. SO THIS IS WHAT WE CALL A HYPERSENSITIVE
###2401 RESPONSE ON THE PART OF THE PLANT. OKAY, SO THAT'S ONE WAY IN
###2407 WHICH THEY CAN PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM MICROBES. AND WHEN
###2411 THEY'RE UNDERGOING AN ATTACK LIKE THAT, THIS IS ALSO GOING TO
###2414 RESULT IN GENERAL STIMULATION OF PLANT DEFENSE GENES IN GENERAL,
###2419 NOT JUST THE SPECIFIC ONES, BUT OTHER PLANT DEFENSE GENES. AND
###2424 THIS CAN RESULT IN PROTECTION AGAINST THE DIVERSITY OF PATHOGENS
###2427 THAT CAN LAST FOR A NUMBER OF DAYS. THIS IS WHAT WE CALL
###2430 SYSTEMIC ACQUIRED RESISTANCE BY THE PLANT. SO WE HAVE BOTH OF
###2436 THESE THINGS GOING ON IN THE CASE OF A MICROBIAL ATTACK. OKAY,
###2442 AS FAR AS HERBIVORES GO, SO BIG CHOMPING ANIMALS FOR EXAMPLE,
###2450 ARTHROPODS LIKE INSECTS OR MITES OR LARGER VERTEBRATE HERBIVORES,
###2458 THESE CAN BE WARDED OFF BY PHYSICAL DEFENSES OF COURSE LIKE THE
###2461 CUTICLES, SPINES, THINGS LIKE THAT, HAIRS ON THE LEAF THAT ARE
###2466 DIFFICULT TO, FOR AN INSECT TO PENETRATE OR GLANDULAR EXUDATES,
###2470 
###2471 THEY PRODUCE. BUT THOSE GLANDULAR EXUDATES AND CHEMISTRY THAT'S
###2477 INSIDE THE, THE LEAF OF THE PLANT CAN ALSO BE IMPORTANT IN
###2483 WARDING OFF HERBIVORES BY PRODUCE, THESE SUBSTANCES WHICH ARE
###2489 CALLED SECONDARY METABOLITES WHICH ARE JUST BASICALLY ANY
###2492 CHEMICAL THAT'S PRODUCED BY A PLANT THAT'S NOT INVOLVED, THAT'S
###2497 NOT NECESSARY FOR SURVIVAL IN REPRODUCTION OF THE PLANT PER SE.
###2502 THESE, THERE'S A VAST DIVERSITY OF CHEMICALS THAT PLANTS PRODUCE
###2506 THAT ARE NOT INVOLVED IN PRIMARY METABOLISM. AND WHEN I WAS A
###2510 GRAD, AN UNDERGRADUATE, THE TYPICAL PLANT ECOLOGIST WAS
###2515 UNWILLING TO ACCEPT THAT THESE CHEMICALS WEREN'T JUST WASTE
###2518 PRODUCTS. YOU KNOW PLANTS CAN'T EASILY EXCRETE THEIR WASTE, SO
###2522 THESE ARE JUST ACCUMULATED WASTE PRODUCTS. BUT IT TURNS OUT
###2526 THAT, THAT THESE CHEMICALS OFTEN HAVE A REALLY, REALLY ARE
###2530 IMPORTANT IN, IN WARDING OFF ATTACK BY PARTICULAR HERBIVORES.
###2536 THEY'RE EITHER TOXIC, DIRECTLY TOXIC TO THE HERBIVORE OR THEY'RE
###2542 DISTASTEFUL. AND IN GENERAL THEY'RE HARMFUL TO THEIR ENEMIES.
###2549 ALSO IN SOME CASES THE ACTUAL ATTACK, THE SALIVA, FOR EXAMPLE, OF
###2555 THE ATTACKER IS RECOGNIZED BY THE PLANT AND THE PLANT CAN PRODUCE
###2561 VOLATILE AIRBORNE CHEMICALS THAT WILL SIGNAL THAT THIS ATTACKER
###2567 IS PRESENT. AND HERE WE CAN SEE, FOR EXAMPLE, SOME MITES THAT
###2574 ARE ATTACKING SOME TOMATOES. VOLATILE CHEMICAL'S PRODUCED. FOR
###2581 EXAMPLE, HERE IS A PREDATORY MITE, PICKS UP ON THIS VOLATILE
###2584 CHEMICAL THAT'S CARRIED IN THE AIR AND THAT INITIATES A RESPONSE
###2590 ON THE PART OF THE MITE TO GO TO THE TOMATO PLANT BECAUSE THAT'S,
###2594 THAT'S LIKE RINGING THE FOOD BELL. MEANS THAT THERE ARE, THERE'S
###2598 
###2599 A TASTY ITEM ON THOSE TOMATO PLANTS, AND THE PREDATORY MITES THEN
###2605 COME TO THE RESCUE. SO THIS IS ESSENTIALLY LIKE A CHEMICAL CALL
###2608 FOR HELP BY THE PLANT. OF COURSE, THE PREDATORY MITE DOESN'T
###2612 REALLY HAVE ALTRUISTIC INTENTIONS TO GO TO RESCUE THE PLANT, BUT
###2617 IT RESCUES THE PLANT ANYWAYS BY COMING AND EATING ITS ATTACKER.
###2621 SO PLANTS HAVE ALL KINDS OF PHYSICAL DEFENSES, CHEMICAL DEFENSES
###2627 LIKE ALKALOIDS, TERPENES, AND OTHER SECONDARY CHEMICALS THAT
###2631 WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH THAT ARE, CAN BE HIGHLY TOXIC TO US OR, OR
###2637 CAN BE USEFUL IN VARIOUS WAYS. AND THEY EVEN CAN BASICALLY
###2642 BRING ON AN ATTACKER. THEY CAN WARN NEIGHBORING PLANTS ABOUT
###2645 THE PRESENCE OF AN ATTACKER THAT CAN ALSO HELP WITH REGARD TO,
###2653 WITH, FOR EXAMPLE, SIGNALING CLOSE RELATIVES OF THE PRESENCE OF
###2657 AN ATTACKER. SO PLANTS DO A LOT OF AMAZING THINGS. AND I HOPE
###2663 THAT THIS PART OF THE COURSE HAS BEEN INTERESTING TO YOU. AND
###2668 IF DO YOU HAVE MORE INTEREST IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT PLANT AND
###2672 FUNGAL DIVERSITY OR ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION, THERE'S A LOT OF
###2676 COURSES OFFERED HERE AT CAL BECAUSE WE HAVE THE NATURAL HISTORY
###2680 MUSEUMS. THERE ARE A LOT OF FACULTY HERE THAT STUDY ORGANISMS
###2684 OF GREAT DIVERSITY. AND THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE COURSES
###2686 THAT, ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND THE OTHER INSTRUCTORS, I WANT TO
###2691 STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER TAKING AFTER YOU PASS THIS
###2696 COURSE WHICH WILL, IS THE MAJOR PREREQUISITE FOR, FOR MOST OF
###2700 THESE COURSES. SO IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE HAVING YOU IN THE COURSE
###2704 AND GOOD LUCK WITH STUDYING. HOPE TO SEE YOU WEDNESDAY.
###2707 [APPLAUSE]. THANKS.
