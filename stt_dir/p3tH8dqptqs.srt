carted back to world


213
0:12:26,81 --> 0:12:29,98
inherited money which comes from the
second reason using them


214
0:12:29,98 --> 0:12:34,13
squeeze we care about infestations
triumphant there's course off the coast


215
0:12:34,13 --> 0:12:39,36
of then see if there is wondrous things
like candlesticks enable treasure


216
0:12:39,36 --> 0:12:44,86
the taxes which the jason taking
template now infestation strengths


217
0:12:44,86 --> 0:12:49,79
soldiers marched tens of thousands of
genes back to rumors slayings


218
0:12:49,79 --> 0:12:53,96
there is a popular myth but they were
forced to work on the coliseum


219
0:12:53,96 --> 0:12:55,39
but the truth


220
0:12:55,39 --> 0:12:57,68
is more complex


221
0:12:57,68 --> 0:13:1,95
does not mean likely you just bring over
huge workforce thirty thousand jews to


222
0:13:1,95 --> 0:13:3,9
build the coliseum


223
0:13:3,9 --> 0:13:4,95
that was taking too long or the taking
too long


224
0:13:4,95 --> 0:13:7,61
trained and this is not about on-the-job
training


225
0:13:7,61 --> 0:13:14,7
in the policy is all about being
efficient and fast in getting it done


226
0:13:14,7 --> 0:13:16,63
real values the slaves to the cities you
know


227
0:13:16,63 --> 0:13:18,24
was money


228
0:13:18,24 --> 0:13:24,2
thirty thousand jewish prisoners and to
the world in chains


229
0:13:24,2 --> 0:13:25,76
total public parade


230
0:13:25,76 --> 0:13:28,49
and


231
0:13:28,49 --> 0:13:31,71
they were sold


232
0:13:31,71 --> 0:13:34,72
there was a ready mark


233
0:13:34,72 --> 0:13:38,21
slaves were an integral part of her life


234
0:13:38,21 --> 0:13:41,37
a rich from a montana several hundred


235
0:13:41,37 --> 0:13:45,8
but even the average citizen could
afford a housewife


236
0:13:45,8 --> 0:13:46,47
the race card to nation


237
0:13:46,47 --> 0:13:50,47
what without slates slaves a part of
their lives and it's part of this


238
0:13:50,47 --> 0:13:51,43
five-c_


239
0:13:51,43 --> 0:13:53,48
it's their expectations


240
0:13:53,48 --> 0:13:57,97
if you sell thirty thousand slaves you
get past huge amounts of money would go


241
0:13:57,97 --> 0:13:58,81
away


242
0:13:58,81 --> 0:14:2,19
the labor of the third of the population
of writing for a whole year it is


243
0:14:2,19 --> 0:14:15,64
something which then he can catchy


244
0:14:15,64 --> 0:14:20,61
aunt espy's ian would need has returned
to painting for his coliseum


245
0:14:20,61 --> 0:14:22,17
williams were


246
0:14:22,17 --> 0:14:25,71
constantly will organized


247
0:14:25,71 --> 0:14:28,96
professor michael davis isn't
architectural historian from mount


248
0:14:28,96 --> 0:14:32,13
holyoke college in the united states


249
0:14:32,13 --> 0:14:35,7
he's in and out about the manpower quiet


250
0:14:35,7 --> 0:14:36,61
it's been estimated that


251
0:14:36,61 --> 0:14:40,529
uh... perhaps as many except quarter of
the population of loan


252
0:14:40,529 --> 0:14:46,38
was involved in some ways or other


253
0:14:46,38 --> 0:14:49,1
homes interviews were accomplished
buildings


254
0:14:49,1 --> 0:14:53,17
this would be the greatest challenge


255
0:14:53,17 --> 0:14:56,33
they needed a nafta theater beacon
strong enough to hold over fifty


256
0:14:56,33 --> 0:14:57,77
thousand people


257
0:14:57,77 --> 0:15:2,15
without collapsing under its own weight


258
0:15:2,15 --> 0:15:6,0
the solution late in three ke
architectural innovations that formed


259
0:15:6,0 --> 0:15:9,27
the secrets of rooms great monuments


260
0:15:9,27 --> 0:15:10,98
the most important


261
0:15:10,98 --> 0:15:12,73
is the bachche


262
0:15:12,73 --> 0:15:17,79
he launches an almost perfect designs
daring halos


263
0:15:17,79 --> 0:15:20,4
and that designed so simple


264
0:15:20,4 --> 0:15:25,83
a series of when she blocks is assembled
together in a semi circular forum


265
0:15:25,83 --> 0:15:30,33
and supported on top of tubular spot the
side


266
0:15:30,33 --> 0:15:35,72
the weight of the building is absorbed
by the keystone the center of the march


267
0:15:35,72 --> 0:15:41,57
and distributed evenly over the entire
span of the margin went down into this


268
0:15:41,57 --> 0:15:44,5
tubes side pillars


269
0:15:44,5 --> 0:15:48,16
this allows the pillars to bear enormous
loads


270
0:15:48,16 --> 0:15:52,36
and because displease in between the
killers instantly


271
0:15:52,36 --> 0:15:56,41
this reduces the weight of the building
even further


272
0:15:56,41 --> 0:15:57,72
starts would become hooked


273
0:15:57,72 --> 0:16:2,29
greenstein throughout the building with
the coliseum


274
0:16:2,29 --> 0:16:5,23
eighty gigantic auctions seven meters
high


275
0:16:5,23 --> 0:16:9,23
former judge removed on the perimeter


276
0:16:9,23 --> 0:16:12,73
on top of the secession other eighty
patches on top of the uses of food


277
0:16:12,73 --> 0:16:13,709
making two hundred


278
0:16:13,709 --> 0:16:17,72
forty arches in or


279
0:16:17,72 --> 0:16:19,529
the coliseum really


280
0:16:19,529 --> 0:16:20,68
is nothing


281
0:16:20,68 --> 0:16:23,44
but arches it's symphony


282
0:16:23,44 --> 0:16:32,16
of arches


283
0:16:32,16 --> 0:16:39,17
uh...


284
0:16:39,17 --> 0:16:44,3
the organization required to achieve his
feet of engineering was phenomenal


285
0:16:44,3 --> 0:16:49,18
even here brooms engineers had a trickle
to a determines


286
0:16:49,18 --> 0:16:52,12
building was a business of mass
production


287
0:16:52,12 --> 0:16:55,66
standardization uski efficient building
of the cards


288
0:16:55,66 --> 0:17:0,41
for example the romans used the arch and
artistic p_d_ again to begin weekend by


289
0:17:0,41 --> 0:17:2,119
countless teams


290
0:17:2,119 --> 0:17:4,99
of builders and that kind of
standardization


291
0:17:4,99 --> 0:17:10,17
is very keen to what we have been in
industrialized world today


292
0:17:10,17 --> 0:17:15,209
breaking down of the building allows
them to have lots of workdays


293
0:17:15,209 --> 0:17:20,2
you skills to just disagree with it


294
0:17:20,2 --> 0:17:20,909
in this way


295
0:17:20,909 --> 0:17:24,259
thousands of labor is working on the
policy that could be left to build a


296
0:17:24,259 --> 0:17:27,51
section with minimal supervision


297
0:17:27,51 --> 0:17:31,12
confident in the knowledge that made
this would be repeated pulled over the


298
0:17:31,12 --> 0:17:32,96
structure


299
0:17:32,96 --> 0:17:34,929
it and have a lot of unskilled


300
0:17:34,929 --> 0:17:38,48
levers you could have a lot of prickly
you can have a lot of people


301
0:17:38,48 --> 0:17:40,36
that's have some sort of skill


302
0:17:40,36 --> 0:17:41,95
all but they're not going to be


303
0:17:41,95 --> 0:17:44,5
replied no more than a whole lot


304
0:17:44,5 --> 0:17:47,85
they didn't have a lot but still leaves
people they're going to be carvings


305
0:17:47,85 --> 0:17:50,94
columns people they're going to be
carving the statues that are going to go


306
0:17:50,94 --> 0:17:52,9
and it is in the upper floors


307
0:17:52,9 --> 0:17:55,7
steven have a lot of skill classmate


308
0:17:55,7 --> 0:17:59,59
if they have a lot of unskilled people
participating in this very massive


309
0:17:59,59 --> 0:18:6,28
important instructions


310
0:18:6,28 --> 0:18:11,8
the concept of repetition was at the
heart of the coliseum is design


311
0:18:11,8 --> 0:18:14,79
the architects put to theaters
back-to-back to create one john and


312
0:18:14,79 --> 0:18:16,6
theater in the round war


313
0:18:16,6 --> 0:18:21,32
and if the actual since the greeks
contact


314
0:18:21,32 --> 0:18:24,27
is trying to remember to acquire
encountering


315
0:18:24,27 --> 0:18:29,24
eighteen options


316
0:18:29,24 --> 0:18:34,57
this estee seems engineers planned for
the six concentric rings of options


317
0:18:34,57 --> 0:18:38,73
written into the center of the coliseum


318
0:18:38,73 --> 0:18:42,2
the space between the central beans was
bound together with rough looks a bulk


319
0:18:42,2 --> 0:18:44,21
annexed to fire


320
0:18:44,21 --> 0:18:47,3
versatile building style


321
0:18:47,3 --> 0:18:48,72
peaceful in the case


322
0:18:48,72 --> 0:18:52,79
of the superstructure


323
0:18:52,79 --> 0:18:59,85
but even building with options would
require an enormous amount of stone


324
0:18:59,85 --> 0:19:3,169
more than two hundred thousand tons of
limestone would be used to


325
0:19:3,169 --> 0:19:6,29
policies


326
0:19:6,29 --> 0:19:7,25

331
0:19:23,31 --> 0:19:25,32
the material has to be coming in


332
0:19:25,32 --> 0:19:28,87

in fact his estimate of the two hundred
carts making dietrich specific six who


336
0:19:41,27 --> 0:19:46,43
used to transport systems of the site


337
0:19:46,43 --> 0:19:51,68
stone arches made a building with the
coliseum possible


338
0:19:51,68 --> 0:19:57,74
but it was so she chick the building
still face the unthinkable


339
0:19:57,74 --> 0:20:0,61
if it was made entirely understand


340
0:20:0,61 --> 0:20:4,5
mystery seems grand arena could simply
crumbled


341
0:20:4,5 --> 0:20:8,27
under its too late


342
0:20:8,27 --> 0:20:14,1
it


343
0:20:14,1 --> 0:20:17,22
eighty seventy five


344
0:20:17,22 --> 0:20:21,33
the coliseum has been under construction
for five years now the scale of the


345
0:20:21,33 --> 0:20:26,3
project is becoming clear


346
0:20:26,3 --> 0:20:31,98
the buildings and he's convinced me to
finds it together


347
0:20:31,98 --> 0:20:36,49
beaches more tourism tourism controlled
the part of intelligence


348
0:20:36,49 --> 0:20:39,5
grumman continue to solve the problem


349
0:20:39,5 --> 0:20:39,77
mixes


350
0:20:39,77 --> 0:20:41,83
folk access


351
0:20:41,83 --> 0:20:45,22
but the more times down


352
0:20:45,22 --> 0:20:48,59
they called it cooper's sick leave


353
0:20:48,59 --> 0:20:49,17
request


354
0:20:49,17 --> 0:20:50,15
concrete


355
0:20:50,15 --> 0:20:52,94
use completely revolutionized


356
0:20:52,94 --> 0:20:54,2
roman architecture


357
0:20:54,2 --> 0:20:58,37
so what you have to ease this material
that he she feeds you


358
0:20:58,37 --> 0:20:59,32
at parts


359
0:20:59,32 --> 0:21:0,48
or faults


360
0:21:0,48 --> 0:21:3,549
so it's very fluid and contains on


361
0:21:3,549 --> 0:21:8,72
uh... for idea of shapes and this is
what i think again white battle in such


362
0:21:8,72 --> 0:21:13,47
a distinctive quality to roman
architecture


363
0:21:13,47 --> 0:21:14,95
it's main advantage


364
0:21:14,95 --> 0:21:16,919
his versatility


365
0:21:16,919 --> 0:21:19,98
concrete was much stronger than
traditional molter


366
0:21:19,98 --> 0:21:21,32
responses


367
0:21:21,32 --> 0:21:22,83
and waterproof


368
0:21:22,83 --> 0:21:24,68
much liked instead


369
0:21:24,68 --> 0:21:29,28
throughout the rooms to create a
lightweight version of the college


370
0:21:29,28 --> 0:21:33,95
ideal for spamming largest pieces


371
0:21:33,95 --> 0:21:37,78
like those between the crucial
structural beams


372
0:21:37,78 --> 0:21:41,79
concrete was also used to create the
superstructure on which the city was


373
0:21:41,79 --> 0:21:43,37
late


374
0:21:43,37 --> 0:21:49,46
and it allows the seating to be raised
two key optimum angle for the spectators


375
0:21:49,46 --> 0:21:55,3
so minorities sleepers in angola thirty
degrees rising to fifty five degrees


376
0:21:55,3 --> 0:21:58,51
thirteen


377
0:21:58,51 --> 0:21:59,419
that's great


378
0:21:59,419 --> 0:22:3,69
spectators at the back quickly review of
the people


379
0:22:3,69 --> 0:22:7,12
vinod verma


380
0:22:7,12 --> 0:22:11,48
but the seating plan at another time


381
0:22:11,48 --> 0:22:12,16
seating


382
0:22:12,16 --> 0:22:15,2
because see unlike the seeking a
different standard building


383
0:22:15,2 --> 0:22:16,359
inbred world


384
0:22:16,359 --> 0:22:21,5
has a hierarchy of weight you've got it


385
0:22:21,5 --> 0:22:23,83
at the very firm to the stadiums the
podium


386
0:22:23,83 --> 0:22:30,38
web room senators have reserved seats


387
0:22:30,38 --> 0:22:31,35
behind them


388
0:22:31,35 --> 0:22:37,53
on nine terraces of model seats puts it
the equestrian is rooms business class


389
0:22:37,53 --> 0:22:41,73
these aristocrats chose not to into
politics so they could concentrate on


390
0:22:41,73 --> 0:22:46,309
the business of making money


391
0:22:46,309 --> 0:22:52,8
must belong to the families of the
senators in front of him


392
0:22:52,8 --> 0:22:56,88
into tears about sethi ordinary citizens
of road packed together along twenty


393
0:22:56,88 --> 0:23:1,69
miles thirty terrorists


394
0:23:1,69 --> 0:23:2,8
this is that


395
0:23:2,8 --> 0:23:6,81
limits of the space isn't subregional
amphitheater but it sounds out of the


396
0:23:6,81 --> 0:23:10,35
fifteen years working terraces to which
the poorest members of roman society


397
0:23:10,35 --> 0:23:13,38
will relegated


398
0:23:13,38 --> 0:23:18,89
so the coliseum would be much more than
just a sporting arena


399
0:23:18,89 --> 0:23:20,63
it'll be a microcosm


400
0:23:20,63 --> 0:23:22,12
society


401
0:23:22,12 --> 0:23:23,69
as you go up to say


402
0:23:23,69 --> 0:23:27,46
will lie in all of these where do i fit
in


403
0:23:27,46 --> 0:23:32,73
spelled out to a precise position in the
higher


404
0:23:32,73 --> 0:23:33,7
received


405
0:23:33,7 --> 0:23:37,169
right around that into see uh... the
whole populace of rome


406
0:23:37,169 --> 0:23:45,169
city where they were supposed to


407
0:23:45,169 --> 0:23:47,27
but with a build still in its infancy


408
0:23:47,27 --> 0:23:53,6
species as engineers would bristling
with more fundamental boxes


409
0:23:53,6 --> 0:23:56,56
concrete wasn't suitable for every
structural job


410
0:23:56,56 --> 0:24:2,26
they still needed like sweet alternative
that would be a strong stone


411
0:24:2,26 --> 0:24:3,59
what we turn to


412
0:24:3,59 --> 0:24:4,8
so monday


413
0:24:4,8 --> 0:24:7,31
so common to lot everyday lives


414
0:24:7,31 --> 0:24:11,36
renewed on the even notice it


415
0:24:11,36 --> 0:24:16,88
it's a good revolutionize the way the
buildings were made


416
0:24:16,88 --> 0:24:18,7
the romans


417
0:24:18,7 --> 0:24:21,81
invented to read to bring


418
0:24:21,81 --> 0:24:24,82
the romans traditionally used terra
cotta


419
0:24:24,82 --> 0:24:27,49
the red clay found throughout the
mediterranean today


420
0:24:27,49 --> 0:24:30,12
roofing tiles


421
0:24:30,12 --> 0:24:32,59
they started experimenting


422
0:24:32,59 --> 0:24:34,12
ray mysteriously take


423
0:24:34,12 --> 0:24:36,59
details of the bridges


424
0:24:36,59 --> 0:24:41,48
in houston as facing material or
involves in architecture


425
0:24:41,48 --> 0:24:45,98
and this leads the news review
possibilities and ways of building the


426
0:24:45,98 --> 0:24:48,37
haven't existed before


427
0:24:48,37 --> 0:24:52,79
nowhere uses more obvious that the
coliseum


428
0:24:52,79 --> 0:24:54,95
these everywhere


429
0:24:54,95 --> 0:24:56,78
and when combined with concrete


430
0:24:56,78 --> 0:24:59,279
he gave the ever-present uh... chin


431
0:24:59,279 --> 0:25:5,61
which is so important to the coliseum a
whole new lease of life


432
0:25:5,61 --> 0:25:9,22
the romans skillfully combined different
materials


433
0:25:9,22 --> 0:25:13,49
to build structures that were very large
and high


434
0:25:13,49 --> 0:25:15,57
off the ground for at least built


435
0:25:15,57 --> 0:25:20,1
but he's still not arches to support the
weight of the structure above


436
0:25:20,1 --> 0:25:23,83
using the language reveals a brick and
concrete


437
0:25:23,83 --> 0:25:24,87
they've built a second


438
0:25:24,87 --> 0:25:27,39
level of arches about that


439
0:25:27,39 --> 0:25:31,37
and then the third level of arches about
that


440
0:25:31,37 --> 0:25:36,61
they could plant your point era arches
to build structures that were higher n


441
0:25:36,61 --> 0:25:42,15
lighter than any that have been built
before


442
0:25:42,15 --> 0:25:48,71
but building a types of up to fifty
meters had created yet another child


443
0:25:48,71 --> 0:25:53,27
new cream existed that could lift
building materials so high


444
0:25:53,27 --> 0:25:56,6
the whole she go to the construction the
coliseum


445
0:25:56,6 --> 0:25:58,1
uh... resides in the fact that we have


446
0:25:58,1 --> 0:26:1,729
before main stories we can see right
over here that we have the first story


447
0:26:1,729 --> 0:26:3,34
with a series of arches


448
0:26:3,34 --> 0:26:7,799
than we have the people standing robert
second-story and it didn't work out for


449
0:26:7,799 --> 0:26:11,19
and that's where you put it you're
praying to get more building material


450
0:26:11,19 --> 0:26:12,48
and working on that level


451
0:26:12,48 --> 0:26:15,26
building up the next week


452
0:26:15,26 --> 0:26:19,53
to move all this material groomsmen
peter cantik cranes operated by large


453
0:26:19,53 --> 0:26:24,33
trade


454
0:26:24,33 --> 0:26:27,5
he seems to clean genius block and
tackle system


455
0:26:27,5 --> 0:26:29,54
depicted in accounting for the time


456
0:26:29,54 --> 0:26:30,98
too pleased to have you got


457
0:26:30,98 --> 0:26:32,73
onto the platform


458
0:26:32,73 --> 0:26:35,75
and summed up by forwarding the same
thing you're pushing at the cranes are


459
0:26:35,75 --> 0:26:38,7
putting up a building materials and
working on that very clear


460
0:26:38,7 --> 0:26:41,48
finally you're able to work on the top
floor


461
0:26:41,48 --> 0:26:42,82
at that point they getting


462
0:26:42,82 --> 0:26:52,94
quite high yes


463
0:26:52,94 --> 0:26:56,59
there are more than a million breaks in
the coliseum


464
0:26:56,59 --> 0:26:58,17
to keep the project on the track


465
0:26:58,17 --> 0:27:4,63
the romans needed to produce bricks and
a terrific right


466
0:27:4,63 --> 0:27:9,44
the solution is something we can will
recognize today


467
0:27:9,44 --> 0:27:13,76
governments purchased at bricks in
factories all over the city


468
0:27:13,76 --> 0:27:16,96
he's recalled fabricate


469
0:27:16,96 --> 0:27:19,66
two thousand years before henry ford


470
0:27:19,66 --> 0:27:23,93
improvements they devised the production


471
0:27:23,93 --> 0:27:28,38
the building of the coliseum round like
of well loyalty mission


472
0:27:28,38 --> 0:27:29,61
so you can imagine that


473
0:27:29,61 --> 0:27:34,48
as this goes up units stories you've got
things are still going on in the lower


474
0:27:34,48 --> 0:27:39,66
floors like decoration on the vaults the
painting in the stock going into self


475
0:27:39,66 --> 0:27:44,32
this is going on for you here's in years
and years


476
0:27:44,32 --> 0:27:50,81
given


477
0:27:50,81 --> 0:27:56,65
coliseum project would consume the whole
of room for more than a decade


478
0:27:56,65 --> 0:28:2,17
and ultimately outlived its creator


479
0:28:2,17 --> 0:28:5,66
in eighty seventy nine improve the
spacing


480
0:28:5,66 --> 0:28:9,0
the man whose vision that made between
the reality


481
0:28:9,0 --> 0:28:13,55
dies


482
0:28:13,55 --> 0:28:16,3
as room mourns the loss of its popular
and


483
0:28:16,3 --> 0:28:19,88
is some titus takes the throne


484
0:28:19,88 --> 0:28:26,86
he decrees that his father's great
amphitheater will


485
0:28:26,86 --> 0:28:28,25
the new emperor


486
0:28:28,25 --> 0:28:40,71
has just said his workers


487
0:28:40,71 --> 0:28:44,11
the builders of the coliseum and they
seem to compute the stadium in time for


488
0:28:44,11 --> 0:28:46,62
its king local games


489
0:28:46,62 --> 0:28:51,279
they have only partially succeeded


490
0:28:51,279 --> 0:28:53,559
as the students to learn from the time
shes


491
0:28:53,559 --> 0:28:57,22
it's still missing sometimes for


492
0:28:57,22 --> 0:28:59,2
true to role in tradition


493
0:28:59,2 --> 0:29:3,34
this building probably wasn't even told
we can't just so you have many


494
0:29:3,34 --> 0:29:6,99
inaugurations many dates in which the
people show up and you still have a


495
0:29:6,99 --> 0:29:9,77
staffing up by the staffing behind


496
0:29:9,77 --> 0:29:13,42
exp teaching team


497
0:29:13,42 --> 0:29:18,0
first still


498
0:29:18,0 --> 0:29:22,79
now brooms coliseum opens for business


499
0:29:22,79 --> 0:29:26,16
must have been locked spectator


500
0:29:26,16 --> 0:29:27,79
really got everyone's attention


501
0:29:27,79 --> 0:29:30,36
was the scale


502
0:29:30,36 --> 0:29:31,64
gleaming white


503
0:29:31,64 --> 0:29:34,169
no one's been here before your
inaugurates place


504
0:29:34,169 --> 0:29:36,98
all of this would an incredible
spectacle


505
0:29:36,98 --> 0:29:40,899
every sports fan in room is clamoring to
see the including sc


506
0:29:40,899 --> 0:29:42,24
tens of thousands of people


507
0:29:42,24 --> 0:29:45,81
crowd outside the stadium


508
0:29:45,81 --> 0:29:48,26
newspeople safely and quickly to the
seeds


509
0:29:48,26 --> 0:29:50,58
will be a mammoth task


510
0:29:50,58 --> 0:29:52,23
the coliseum still does


511
0:29:52,23 --> 0:29:54,83
of cracks the proper


512
0:29:54,83 --> 0:29:56,62
on the northwestern corner


513
0:29:56,62 --> 0:30:0,89
there five bwz embedded into the
pavement


514
0:30:0,89 --> 0:30:4,1
all that remains of distinctions crowd
control system


515
0:30:4,1 --> 0:30:6,0
this is to keep people back


516
0:30:6,0 --> 0:30:11,14
prior to entry this is where you could
check the people going aight


517
0:30:11,14 --> 0:30:14,399
it what people think so they can't be
directed


518
0:30:14,399 --> 0:30:16,659
towards the right numbered gateway


519
0:30:16,659 --> 0:30:20,62
didn't feel coliseum itself


520
0:30:20,62 --> 0:30:22,799
just like a modern spectator today


521
0:30:22,799 --> 0:30:25,899
every room in the coming to the games
was issued a ticket


522
0:30:25,899 --> 0:30:28,279
deficit to them


523
0:30:28,279 --> 0:30:33,35
that's about one of the total which of
the seventy-six stadium entrances to use


524
0:30:33,35 --> 0:30:36,83
you can still see many of the intrigued
and discarded into the stand above the


525
0:30:36,83 --> 0:30:39,919
entrances today


526
0:30:39,919 --> 0:30:41,7
they have used a crafty trick


527
0:30:41,7 --> 0:30:44,17
up the excitement


528
0:30:44,17 --> 0:30:47,85
i think that the seating was
deliberately restricted it was a tough


529
0:30:47,85 --> 0:30:49,15
ticket to get


530
0:30:49,15 --> 0:30:54,39
and opt for a specially for the big
games


531
0:30:54,39 --> 0:30:55,73
these tensions


532
0:30:55,73 --> 0:30:58,93
is dedicated to a certain sectors of the
society


533
0:30:58,93 --> 0:31:0,46
the more important to her


534
0:31:0,46 --> 0:31:5,149
these here it was to get a seat


535
0:31:5,149 --> 0:31:8,24
entered through a richly decorated came
to the south side


536
0:31:8,24 --> 0:31:11,9
which was later replaced by an
underground passageway direct to his


537
0:31:11,9 --> 0:31:14,47
house


538
0:31:14,47 --> 0:31:18,9
the grand entrance opposite allowed
rooms official magistrates to walk


539
0:31:18,9 --> 0:31:20,429
straight to bed bugs


540
0:31:20,429 --> 0:31:24,6
right next to the arena


541
0:31:24,6 --> 0:31:27,9
this entrance was shared by the senators


542
0:31:27,9 --> 0:31:29,419
over the next step down in the pecking


543
0:31:29,419 --> 0:31:35,0
people sit in georgia ringside


544
0:31:35,0 --> 0:31:37,87
in each culture of the stadium three
gates who is a


545
0:31:37,87 --> 0:31:39,76
further questions


546
0:31:39,76 --> 0:31:46,799
and in a corridor commercial flight of
stairs bullpen out into their seats


547
0:31:46,799 --> 0:31:50,179
ordinary citizens of rome had to let
them pass before it using the remaining


548
0:31:50,179 --> 0:31:59,29
fourteen gates to spiral up several
flights of stairs onto the terraces


549
0:31:59,29 --> 0:32:0,61
just stoked up


550
0:32:0,61 --> 0:32:6,51
thirteen eight steps to get to the
wooden benches


551
0:32:6,51 --> 0:32:7,95
so if your plan


552
0:32:7,95 --> 0:32:11,67
and upload without money keeping or even
a slave on the day off you're going up


553
0:32:11,67 --> 0:32:14,83
to the newest but since there are no
elevators you could have the pulpit all


554
0:32:14,83 --> 0:32:15,789
the way up there


555
0:32:15,789 --> 0:32:18,54
in your view that can be a good deal


556
0:32:18,54 --> 0:32:20,61
this extremely efficient system


557
0:32:20,61 --> 0:32:24,45
maintained a constant flow of people
eliminated choke points as much as


558
0:32:24,45 --> 0:32:26,21
possible


559
0:32:26,21 --> 0:32:27,9
it's been estimated that


560
0:32:27,9 --> 0:32:32,58
the fifteen fifty five thousand people
that would feel the coliseum uh... could


561
0:32:32,58 --> 0:32:39,85
exit within half an hour that kind opt
for active called efficient planning


562
0:32:39,85 --> 0:32:45,539
hasn't been surpassed today and in many
ways still provides a kind of model


563
0:32:45,539 --> 0:32:50,8
uh... four uh... modern steel design


564
0:32:50,8 --> 0:32:53,39
listen sign consent


565
0:32:53,39 --> 0:32:55,31
but when it was first okay


566
0:32:55,31 --> 0:32:56,48
onto the computer


567
0:32:56,48 --> 0:32:57,909
court economists


568
0:32:57,909 --> 0:33:0,46
besides and hans the since the practice


569
0:33:0,46 --> 0:33:8,62
constraints


570
0:33:8,62 --> 0:33:11,68
and the stadium corridors winter storm
in the spring


571
0:33:11,68 --> 0:33:15,34
everywhere he went to pick a random
approves this whole thing selling every


572
0:33:15,34 --> 0:33:20,11
kind of merchandise civilians fast food


573
0:33:20,11 --> 0:33:22,14
sex you name it


574
0:33:22,14 --> 0:33:24,72
they've got it because several for


575
0:33:24,72 --> 0:33:26,25
was the gladiators


576
0:33:26,25 --> 0:33:28,48
justice with boldness for stocks


577
0:33:28,48 --> 0:33:33,82
there is merchandising all of packet we
find gladiators appearing on raymond


578
0:33:33,82 --> 0:33:35,14
land speed fine


579
0:33:35,14 --> 0:33:41,5
gladiators born strom speak freind
literally soldier like traci exits for


580
0:33:41,5 --> 0:33:41,89
aids


581
0:33:41,89 --> 0:33:44,58
and these are extremely popular that's a
great souvenirs


582
0:33:44,58 --> 0:33:46,37
and you think that when these people


583
0:33:46,37 --> 0:33:48,499
were the superstars update date


584
0:33:48,499 --> 0:33:49,82
they're being in recognized


585
0:33:49,82 --> 0:33:53,41
fourteen so many ways including
emergence


586
0:33:53,41 --> 0:33:55,15
now for the first time


587
0:33:55,15 --> 0:33:56,859
the spectators steps out


588
0:33:56,859 --> 0:33:58,98
into the stadium


589
0:33:58,98 --> 0:34:0,179
i was hit


590
0:34:0,179 --> 0:34:12,879
by a wall of sound


591
0:34:12,879 --> 0:34:14,209
the super dome


592
0:34:14,209 --> 0:34:19,429
dominates the romans skyline


593
0:34:19,429 --> 0:34:23,709
encompassed resumes vision has become
the most spectacular amphitheater vote


594
0:34:23,709 --> 0:34:28,39
world has


595
0:34:28,39 --> 0:34:30,69
upwards of fifty thousand


596
0:34:30,69 --> 0:34:32,569
crowded constancy


597
0:34:32,569 --> 0:34:34,289
according to one side


598
0:34:34,289 --> 0:34:38,789
appt eighty seven thousand might
compacting


599
0:34:38,789 --> 0:34:41,299
that's more than most super jones today


600
0:34:41,299 --> 0:34:44,62
modern sports stadium or allot less
claustrophobic


601
0:34:44,62 --> 0:34:45,51
contributing


602
0:34:45,51 --> 0:34:46,629
roman coliseum


603
0:34:46,629 --> 0:34:49,659
very little seed space for forty two
percent


604
0:34:49,659 --> 0:34:50,759
they work past


605
0:34:50,759 --> 0:34:59,79
quite literally cheek by job


606
0:34:59,79 --> 0:35:3,13
and it could get unbearably hot on the
terraces during summer months


607
0:35:3,13 --> 0:35:11,49
up to forty degrees celsius


608
0:35:11,49 --> 0:35:14,329
top malval's uh... unhappy mob


609
0:35:14,329 --> 0:35:18,59
