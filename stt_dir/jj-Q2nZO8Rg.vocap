###85 I discussed the fishy story of fishapods last week - the alleged history of the
###90 fishees growing legs and walking up onto land and becoming amphibians -
###94 tetrapods.  A wonderful story, complete with an alleged fossil ancestral tree!
###99 So now we look to this weeks report of a find of bizarre, legless amphibians which
###105 live predominantly underground.  Although they are called Caecilians, rest assured
###110 they have nothing to do with Italy.  The report discusses finding a whole mess of
###115 these strange creatures nesting in Northern India.  Now this is not the first
###118 find of ceacilians, they are well known, just not in India.
###123 However, you'll recall the convoluted history of evolution presented last week,
###130 which has now gotten even weirder: according to the evolutionism myth, fish
###136 grew legs, walked up on to land to become four-legged amphibians which
###140 diversified into all kinds of other land creatures - including cows, dogs,
###145 cheetahs, apes and humans....while many other organisms decided to go on strike
###150 and never evolve, while still yet some of those four-legged amphibians
###154 mysteriously decided they were better off without legs, and evolved into these
###160 legless amphibians.  And so the evolutionism myth takes another bizarre
###166 twist in its just-so story. So obviously these legless amphbians
###173 have been quite successful without legs, so why did the fish evolve legs in the first
###178 place?  If there was an advantage to legs, then why did these amphibians de-evolve,
###185 losing their legs? In the end, the answer is irrelevent,
###191 because Evolution will simply make it fit - answers or not, because evolution
###197 conforms to whatever evidence it is presented with, because it is not science.
###203 You are certainly welcome to believe evolution, just please, don't call it
###208 science.
###210 General Electric released details on its stunning new thermal-imaging technology
###215 last week, along with a report in Nature Photonics.  Researchers were studying
###219 the wings of butterflies, and made a surprise discovery.  The Morpho butterfly
###225 glistens with a stunning, beautiful blue. It's what causes this colour that caught
###230 the eye of researchers and inspired the design of an electronic eye.
###235 Examined under an electron microscope, the researchers discovered the surface of
###240 the wings were covered in an array of tree-like nanostructures.  This "forest" did
###247 several things: It refracted light, enhancing blues and removing other
###252 colours of light.  That was already interesting, but what they also realized
###257 was that this forest expands and contracts with temperature, which alters
###264 what colour of light is enhanced or removed.
###267 Taking this tip from the butterfly, GE engineers then set out to design a camera
###273 that "sees" temperature - thermal imaging - based on what they learned from the
###278 butterfly wings. The results are stunning - with the
###282 camera able to see temperature differences less than 0.2 degrees Celcius
###288 - and with incredible speed - a response time of about 1/40th of a second.  To give
###295 you an idea of just how fast that is, consider that this video is a series of
###300 different pictures, every picture on the screen for a fleeting moment - 1/30th of a
###305 second.  In less time then it took for you to see this subliminal message ***********,
###310 the GE thermal camera has taken millions of temperature readings and recorded
###314 them!.
###316 But of course, even though the camera was intelligently designed, why is it so
###321 hard for people to believe the butterfly was also designed?  Such intricacies in
###327 the butterfly wing have no apparent evolutionary purpose.  Yet it is within the
###331 character of a Creator God to make things that are just plain pleasing to the
###336 eye, which He also created.
###339 A baffling mystery was revealed this week in National Geographic magazine: The
###345 European Space Agency's Venus Express orbiter has been mapping the surface of
###349 Venus. A problem arose when the photographic maps did not line up with
###355 the photographic maps taken by NASA a mere 16 years ago.  After checking, double
###360 checking and triple checking, the planet's features almost seemed to have moved
###365 12.4 MILES from where they were last seen!
###371 It would appear that the rotation of the planet is slowing down - and dramatically
###377 so.  Venus is already an odd-ball in our solar system with a retrograde rotation - it
###384 spins in a direction opposite the majority of planets.  This is already a fatal problem
###390 for the naturalist theories of the origin of the planet. But now to discover the
###395 planet's spin slowing down? And dramatically so at that!  It remains to be
###401 seen exactly what is going on here, but one thing can be said: If this change in
###406 spin rate is consistent, it poses astronomical problems for an old universe
###412 - pun intended.  The farther you go back in time, hypothetically the faster it was
###418 spinning - to the point where forces would rip the planet apart long before you hit
###423 the alleged age of 4.6 billions years old. We'll follow this story with interest.
###430 [scary, dramatic music]
###435 Wahoo! Mail for me?
###439 [beeping sounds]
###444 Hmmm...I forget - are you supposed to cut the red wire or blue wire first?
###450 Or I could just pull the detonator...
###452 [dramatic, scary music]
###456 WilliamTyndale1 made a comment on last week's show, the likes of which I hear
###460 often:
###495 OnceForgivenNowFree also expressed the exasperation so many feel when
###500 reading the skeptical comments:
###525 It should be noted that I frequently get similar comments from non-Christians
###529 and non-creationists. Interestingly, I was having a discussion
###533 with my friend Shannon this week, and she made a very interesting observation
###537 which I think is quite accurate. She had seen some studies written up on road
###541 rage - how people can become absolutely insane from their rage - completely
###548 irrational, emotional, even physically violent.  Normal people who suddenly lose
###553 all control of reason or rationale.  This study apparently concluded that people
###559 considered their cars an extension of their person, and thus violating your car's
###564 personal space was a very personal violation against themselves.
###569 In like fashion, Shannon I think correctly deduced that some people
###574 subconsciously consider evolutionism theory an extension of themselves - for
###579 whatever reason.  And thus when evolutionism is questioned, it becomes an
###583 attack on their person, and they respond with a completely irrational, unreasonable
###589 reaction akin to road rage.  I don't want to pick out examples from the comments,
###594 because I have no interest in publically humiliating people, but the very irrational,
###599 illogical, yea even stupid comments that are persistently and consistently made,
###605 are made by people that I would not consider stupid.  Why? Look at the
###611 comments - they're in a rage. An irrational, illogical, unreasonable rage.
###617 One lady on twitter responded to my last video response to the living dinosaur with
###621 "Ian, he's only going to rub your nose into the dirt even more. You have no chance
###625 of winning against him. None!"
###628 Umm.....who said anything about "winning?"  Such comment is emotional,
###634 personal, irrational - such people are only interested in "winning" - whatever that
###640 means. Personally, I'm interested in the truth, not "winning."  So let the skeptics
###648 rage.

###661 Thanks for writing in.  However, apparently you are unaware that fossil
###665 footprints are very seldom found with the track maker. Of all of the dinosaur
###670 megatrack sites in the world, I only know of four that had some dinosaur remains
###675 contained within the track bearing layers, for example.  I am unaware of a single
###680 body fossil found anywhere in the Coconino sandstone, though there are
###685 innumerable fossil tracks scattered throughout the layers.  The lack of body
###689 fossils has nothing to do with the legitimacy of the tracks.  Police at a crime
###693 scene who see human tracks can positively identify that it's a human, even
###698 if they don't have the human who made the tracks.

###721 Excellent question, but you're mixing things up there. For example, the same
###726 comments could be applied to evolution: What practical benefits for humanity has
###730 evolution produced?  You could also ask the same question for the science of
###734 paleontology.  What are the benefits to humanity? The science you are referring
###739 to uses physics, chemistry, etc... applied to the here and now. Both Creation and
###745 Evolutionism are attempts to explain the past - it's totally different.  Paleontology
###751 and aspects of Geology also have this limitation.
###755 In fact, evolutionism has been detrimental to scientific research - medical research
###760 in particular.  For example: Eugenics. Or Junk DNA and vestigial organs.  The
###767 original, evolutionary interpretation for these things was that they were useless
###772 leftovers from our evolutionary history. We now know that all of the alleged
###777 vestigial organs have purpose, as does the alleged "Junk DNA."
###784 Creationary thinkers would claim that any DNA has purpose - there is no such thing
###790 as useless leftovers. There may be broken DNA or organs, but creationary
###794 thinking would inspire, not hinder scientific research. As a result of
###799 evolutionary teaching that things like the tonsils were useless leftovers, doctors
###804 cut them out of patients quite regularly.....until the discovery that a
###809 tonsillectomy left you prone to polio, and paralysis.  Evolution has HINDERED
###815 scientific process.
###817 The difference here is how your worldview affects how you do science.  In
###822 this case, one world view expects useless leftovers, and deters scientists from
###827 seeking the purpose of useless leftovers. The other worldview would say that
###832 everything had purpose and was part of the overall design, thus compelling
###836 scientists to seek out the purpose and design.  Creationary thinking looks to
###842 nature as DESIGNED, with the intention of copying the Designer's ideas - because
###847 He is such an incredible designer.
###850 A very lengthy discussion about stasis went on last week, and I must give kudos
###854 to Youtuber Fusion840 who attempted to explain the significance and obvious case
###859 for stasis in the fossil record to people who would not listen nor believe.  Hey - at
###865 least you tried!  But the discussion was ended and summed up so nicely in one
###870 sentence by Answersquestions1:
###888 You nailed it!  Thanks to everyone who wrote in comments.

###929 of the dinosaur badlands, the Big Valley Creation Science Museum was built from
###933 the ground up to give credit to our Creator, portraying the scientific evidence
###937 showing that creation is the faith that fits the facts, and that evolution is the faith
###943 that the facts have failed. Visit BVCSM.com for more details.
