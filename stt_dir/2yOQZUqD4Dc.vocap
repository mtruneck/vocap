###2 Earth
###3 a 4,5 billion year old planet
###6 still evolving
###8 As continents shift and clash, volcanoes erupt
###13 and glaciers grow and recede
###16 the earth's crust is carved in numerous and fascinating ways
###22 leaving a trail of geological mysteries behind
###26 In this episode, Iceland
###27 the wolrd's largest volcanic island is explored
###33 This barren and alien landscape generates 1/3 of the world's lava
###40 Steam billows from the ground
###43 and boiling water is thrusted into the air
###47 It's a land of violent extremes
###50 where fire meets it's nemesis, ice
###55 where clues to understanding Iceland's formation
###59 also provide a window into the formation of the earth itself
###74 In the middle of the North Atlantic ocean lies Iceland
###77 a lone island only 300 miles (480 Km) wide
###82 a volcanic hot pit
###83 it holds some of the most diverse geological wonders known to mankind
###89 To understand how it formed
###91 and the dynamic forces that are shaping this land
###93 scientists are scouring the strange landscape for clues
###98 And the investigation starts here
###100 in the southwest of Iceland: Thingvellir plane
###106 This broad inland valley runs through the centre of Iceland
###110 giant cracks scar the valley floor
###113 leaving this unusual landscape behind
###122 Geologist Mike Poland believes there are major clues in the mystery of Iceland's formation
###130 I'm standing at a really spectacular place. There's evidence for volcanic activity all around,
###135 this valley is covered in lava, and the plane has been ripped apart
###139 Everywhere I look there's massive tears in the ground like this one right here
###146 This crack is getting bigger and bigger every year
###148 In fact, this entire valley is spreading apart
###152 at about the same rate the fingernails grow
###154 Imagine the forces that must be involved to rip the land apart like this
###161 Something powerful is spreading this valley at a rate of 1 inch (2,5 cm) per year
###168 A force so inmense it's pulling the entire country apart
###177 But what force on earth could have such power?
###182 In 1912 german climatologist Alfred Wegener,
###186 found an essential clue. Browsing through maps,
###190 he noticed that the great land masses of the Americas and Eurasia appeared to fit together
###198 This observation led Wegener to propose a radical new theory:
###202 That these great continents had once been joined together.
###207 So some unseen force must have pushed them apart
###210 allowing water to rush into the space between them
###214 creating the Atlantic ocean
###218 It was inspired detective work, and a major step forward
###221 in the search for what was pulling Iceand apart
###226 But with no method to prove such a force existed
###229 Wegener's theory was ignored for the next 40 years.
###235 Then in 1946, new evidence was discovered to support Wegener's ideas
###243 The U.S. navy, using a technology called SONAR IMAGING
###248 mapped the Atlantic ocean floor for the first time
###252 The pictures revealed a 10.000 mile (16.000 Km) network of underwater mountains
###257 separated by a giant tear which passes through the center of the Atlantic
###263 Scientists called this the Mid-Atlantic Ridge
###268 This huge tear through the earth's crust is the boundary between the American and Eurasian plates
###274 and the tear runs right through the center of Iceland
###280 I'm actually standing on what's the center of the ocean floor
###283 Where the Mid-Atlantic Ridge comes on the land
###285 and this puts the North American plate on this side
###289 from the Eurasian plate on this side
###291 and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge starts way south, down by Antarctica
###293 comes all the way up through the Atlantic
###295 and splits this country right in two
###299 Scientists suspected this was pushing the continents and Iceland apart
###305 They came up with a theory: Deep below the ocean,
###310 convection currents of molten rock tear open the earth's crust
###313 allowing magma to seep up and push the continents apart
###319 But there was a problem: It was so deep, scientists had no way of proving
###325 where the magma was seeping through the crust at the centre of the ridge
###330 Until in 1974. Alvin, a human-operated submersible
###336 was launched by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute
###341 with its ability to withstand deep-sea pressures, scientists could finally travel down
###346 to the depths needed to reach the Mid-Atlantic Ridge
###351 It was by examining the tear that runs through the center of this ridge
###356 that they spotted the evidence they had been looking for
###359 Hot volcanic gases billowing into the ocean
###366 Finding this told them that the Mid-Atlantic Ridge was highly volcanic
###370 and, like a giant wedge, was capable of spreading great land masses apart
###377 Iceland's cracked Thingvellir Valley is a continuation of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge
###384 The same process that is pushing America further away from Europe
###388 is happening here, on land
###393 Finally, here was a force powerful enough to explain why the cracks are getting wider
###398 and Iceland is getting bigger
###401 As the ridge continues to spread, it's going to add more and more land to Iceland
###406 so in a way Iceland will start getting longer and longer
###410 in an east-west sense, as the plates spread apart from one another
###415 So, in a way, Iceland is not getting torn apart so much as it's getting built
###420 The investigation into how Iceland is growing has revealed:
###424 Cracks on the Thingvellir plane are widening at a rate of 1 inch (2,5 cm) per year
###430 And hot gases prove that this spreading force is volcanic
###435 forming the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which cuts right through Iceland
###442 Scientists concluded it's THIS that's widening the country
###448 Convection currents of hot rock pull the Mid-Atlantic Ridge apart,
###454 magma surges up to fill the cracks,
###457 and as it approaches the surface it cools, hardens, and forms new land
###462 Like a conveyor belt, it continually pushes Iceland apart
###468 But something didn't add up: Why wasn't Iceland at the bottom of the ocean,
###473 like the rest of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge?
###476 There's something strange about the amount of volcanic activity on this island
###481 Because this is not a normal section of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge
###484 There's a tremendous amount of volcanism that's happening in this part of the ridge
###488 as opposed to the ridge that's off in the Atlantic Ocean
###494 The hunt is now on to discover how Iceland rose a mile and a half (2.400 m) off the ocean floor
###500 and became the biggest volcanic island in the world
###510 Iceland
###511 There are more active volcanoes concentrated here
###514 than anywhere else on the planet
###520 Geologists are searching for what has helped to push Iceland off the ocean floor
###525 and lights the firy volcanoes that rage across this barren land
###535 On the hunt for clues, the investigation heads to one of Iceland's most active volcanoes,
###541 Hekla
###542 Known locally as the "Gateway to Hell"
###546 Like all active volcanoes in Iceland, Hekla sits alongside the Mid-Atlantic Ridge
###553 Volcanologist Dr. Pete La Femina is taking a High-resolution scan of the volcano
###559 to see if its geology hides any clues about its inner workings
###564 This is a terrestrial laser scanner
###566 and the laser produces a 3D image of the earth's surface
###571 and that allows us to see parts of Hekla volcano here that we can't see with the naked eye
###579 His scan reveals a giant crack, or fissure, running right through the centre of the volcano
###585 similar to those found in the Thingvellir Valley
###590 But this fissure doesn't just expand the width of the volcano,
###593 it extends either side along a 5-mile (8 Km) tear in the earth
###598 It's this tear that is key to understanding how Iceland's volcanoes erupt
###607 When Hekla erupted in the year 2000 it wasn't just a volcanic cone that exploded
###613 The earth actually ripped open along the entire 5-mile (8 Km) lenght of the fissure,
###619 a weakness created by the stretching along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge
###624 In the geological world these are known as "Fissure Eruptions"
###629 Forced open by the sheer volume of magma pushing up from below,
###634 the tear spewed out a terrifying 750 million cubic feet (21 million m3) of molten rock an hour
###641 flodding the land with lava
###644 These fissure eruptions are so huge they can change the landscape drastically in a matter of days
###652 leaving behind mountains like these
###659 You can see to the North here, where the earth's surface actually opened up
###662 during a fissure eruption, and lava erupted out
###665 This fissure starts to the north and extends 8 Km through
###670 Hekla volcano here
###672 The sheer volume of magma produced can be seen very well here
###677 at Hekla volcano, specially with these lava flows
###680 that have graved the land's surface
###682 And to me this is really exciting, because you can see very large volmes of erupted material
###687 produced over very short amount of time
###690 and Hekla is a beautiful place to study that
###694 But what is creating the vast quantities of lava that are forced out during these eruptions?
###700 For many years the answer remained elusive
###704 until geologists found incriminating evidence locked inside the rocks
###711 The composition of the rocks here in Iceland is quite different
###713 to what we see in other places
###715 By taking this rock back to the Lab we can get a very good idea
###717 of under what conditions it formed
###719 whether it formed deep within the earth or near the surface
###726 This rock was once molten lava which erupted from one of Iceland's volcanoes
###732 Analysis of the chemicals in the rock revealed unusually high concentrations
###737 of rare earth elements, lanthium and cesium,
###741 chemicals which are only found in magma with a very deep origin
###747 It's the breakthrough scentists had been searching for
###750 It was evidence that another, much deeper heath source
###754 was combining with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge
###756 to power the volcanoes of Iceland
###760 The rock evidence suggested this second force laid hidden from view
###765 deep beneath Iceland's surface
###769 But, it is possible to get a glimpse of what's happening down there
###776 Scientists monitor the seismic waves triggered by earthquakes all over the world
###782 As the earth's plates move, they release shockwaves called seimic waves
###787 that pass through the earth's crust
###790 These travel at a steady speed unless they hit a region of hard rock
###795 Then, they slow down
###798 Now as seismic waves arrive in Iceland
###801 they're travelling very slowly through the subsurface
###803 and this is something unique to Iceland and a few other places in the world
###807 It tells us as there's a very hard column of rock
###812 perhaps even some molten material beneath the surface
###816 These massive columns or "plumes" are known as HOT SPOTS
###819 and are not unique to Iceland
###822 They're found beneath certain volcanic areas in the world, like Hawaii and Yellowstone
###828 Hot Spots are these unwavering plumes of hot material
###832 including molten rock -magma- that stream up to the surface from deep within the earth
###840 The scientists finally had a snapshot of the second force
###844 that was helping to create Iceland
###847 The Hot Spot that lies beneath the island
###849 is almost 100 miles (160 Km) wide
###852 and 400 miles (640 Km) deep
###855 It channels rock slowly upwards at temperatures over 700º Fahrenheit
###862 It pushes against the crust, heating the land from below
###866 and forcing magma up onto the surface, as lava
###870 The investigation has identified the two colossal forces that built Iceland
###877 The Mid-Atlantic Ridge
###879 and the deeper Icelandic Hot Spot
###883 Millions of years ago,
###885 the Mid-Atlantic Ridge drifted eastwards
###888 creeping towards the fixed Icelandic Hot Spot
###892 Finally they met, and have been locked together in a deadly partnership
###896 ever since
###901 The result: A truly formidable volcanic beast
###905 capable of creating magma on a monumental scale
###910 As the Mid Ocean Ridge pulls apart
###913 there's decompression of the material underneath it, and that creates melting
###916 Decompression is simply removing the pressure from a pile of rock
###921 it's much like opening a can of soda
###923 or popping the cork off of a champagne bottle
###925 The removal of so much pressure
###927 makes the rock melt into liquid magma
###930 And the Hot Spot is transporting heat directly from the interior of the earth to the surface
###934 which also creates melting
###936 So this combination of decompression of existing rock beneath the surface
###940 and the direct transport of heat from the center of the earth created huge amounts of magma
###946 This incredible meeting of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Hot Spot
###950 began to build the island beneath the waves
###953 pushing it upwards and giving birth to Iceland
###959 Scientists have dated the island's emergence to 20 million years ago
###962 but could only imagine what this might have looked like
###965 But on November 14th, 1963, off the south coast of Iceland
###971 The world watched an action-replay of Iceland's spectacular birth
###980 A column of rock and ash blasted out of the ocean
###983 18.000 feet (5.400 m) into the sky
###986 So high it could be seen 70 miles (110 Km) away in Iceland's capital city, Reykjavík
###993 A new island was forming, right in front of the world's eyes
###1000 Scientists called it Surtsey after the Norse god of fire: Surtr
###1008 Located 20 miles (32 Km) off the mainland,
###1010 the small island of Surtsey is now a magnet for geologists
###1015 It offers a wealth of forensic evidence for Dr. La Femina,
###1019 who is investigating how Iceland first formed
###1026 It'a amazing to see Surtsey for the first time
###1028 I've seen pictures, I've seen aerial photographs
###1030 but actually be here and get a chance to
###1033 to go out and see it up close and actually look at the geology
###1036 it's just inspiring
###1045 This type of eruption that formed Surtsey has now been named after Surtsey
###1049 We call them "Surtseyan Eruptions",
###1050 and they're very, very explosive
###1053 The interaction of hot magma or lava with the ocean
###1057 causes these very steam-rich and highly explosive eruptions
###1061 of ash and water
###1064 When scientists first stepped foot into the island in the summer of '64
###1068 they found it hard to believe that this was an island whose age
###1071 was measured in MONTHS, not millenia
###1074 In about 9,5 months this whole volcanic cone built up
###1080 In addition, lava flows came out of the volcanic center here
###1084 and we seen those as nice black cliffs in front of us
###1089 Now geologists had an insight into how early Iceland might have formed
###1094 In only 20 million years, Iceland grew from a tiny island into a 40.000 square mile (104.000 Km2) landmass,
###1102 as big as the state of Kentucky
###1107 The forces that powered Iceland's volcanoes
###1109 have been revealed
###1112 Cracks along Hekla volcano unleashed gigantic fissure eruptions
###1118 and rare chemicals in the rock proved
###1121 that these eruptions were fuelled by two separated forces:
###1125 Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the Hot Spot
###1130 Iceland grew to become the world's largest volcanic island
###1135 But volcanism alone doesn't explain how the land of Iceland was formed
###1141 The investigation will honour another equally dramatic force
###1144 that sculpted the distinctive shape of the Iceland we know today
###1149 A force which would challenge the might of Iceland's volcanoes
###1161 If Iceland was formed by fire alone,
###1163 it should look like other volcanic islands such as Hawaii or Tahiti
###1168 But something else was at work here to transform this island
###1173 into the distinctive shape it is today
###1177 Its shape is another clue to Iceland's formation
###1181 An extraordinary force indented Iceland's Northern coastline
###1185 burrowing deep fjords which extended far inland
###1191 But, what colossal force could cause such a dramatic change to Iceland's volcanic landscape?
###1197 There's an obvious suspect that is found scattered across the island:
###1201 Ice
###1203 As its name suggests, Iceland has a long history of being covered in ice, like this
###1211 Today it covers 10% of the island
###1214 all year round
###1216 And in the middle of the country lies Europe's biggest ice cap:
###1222 The mighty Vatnajökull
###1226 Over 3000 square miles (7.800 Km2) in size
###1228 Vatnajökull is so large it even has its own climatic conditions
###1237 Up to two thirds of a mile (1 Km) thick,
###1238 it squashes the land like a giant slab of rock
###1242 and at its edges great tongues of ice
###1244 flow out through deep valleys
###1254 Glacier expert Dr. Mattew Roberts
###1256 is investigating how ice can gauge out solid rock
###1260 and discover the role it is playing in Iceland's past
###1269 This is a GPS receiver, just like in car satellite navigation
###1273 it's used here to measure glacier movement
###1276 this will be left on the ice surface for a few days
###1277 and I'll come back and analyse the data
###1280 to discover just how far the glacier has moved
###1284 Dr. Roberts data reveals that this whole glacier is sliding forward
###1289 at an astounding rate of 2 feet (0,6 m) ... per day!
###1294 This is an amazing ever changing environement: The ice around me is like
###1297 an icy sea that has been frozen in place
###1300 As the ice flows out to the confines of the valley
###1304 it expands, it spreads to occupy a greater area
###1306 Now as it expands, crevasses form
###1309 In large depressions, just like the one here,
###1311 (here's a smaller crevasse that is formed)
###1314 ocasionally when these crevasses open, as it begin to open,
###1317 sounds can be heard
###1319 Also, the glacier ocasionally makes a groaning sound
###1323 it's all signs that the glacier is alive and moving forward
###1326 very slowly
###1330 Vatnajökull is one of the largest ice caps in the northern hemisphere
###1335 flowing down the valleys, the great mass of ice
###1338 bears down with the weight of 100 tons per square foot (975 tons/m2)
###1344 Dr. Roberts believes this moving giant is a force
###1347 capable of eroding solid rock,
###1349 and he has found crucial evidence to prove it
###1352 This is an excellent example of the power of glacial erosion
###1355 This boulder would have been trapped beneath the base of the ice
###1358 and, as the ice flowed over the surface of it,
###1360 it would have progressively eroded the surface of the boulder
###1363 to produce these very distinctive marks, called striations, in its surface
###1368 We can even tell the direction in wich the ice was flowing
###1371 If I take a rock, I can illustrate this
###1373 Imagine this is the base of the ice,
###1376 the material trapped inside the ice
###1379 being dragged across as the glacier moved
###1382 to produce this very distinctive marks in the surface
###1385 This is just like sandpaper over wood,
###1388 the same erosive effect
###1391 The erosive process that's happening on this boulder
###1394 is the same process that's happening on a much larger scale
###1397 along the surface of these valleys
###1400 The glacier is responsible for literally carving the landscape,
###1403 producing very distinctive throughs and basins
###1407 which were formerly infilled with solid rock
###1409 This really testifies the erosive power of a glacier
###1415 The ancient fjords on the north coast
###1417 are the same deep-basin shape
###1420 Which means they must once have been filled with ice
###1426 Scientists now know that around 1,5 million years ago
###1429 changes in the earth's orbit and the tilt of its axis
###1433 began to cool the planet
###1437 An enormous ice sheet descended from the north
###1440 and shrouded Iceland in a cloak of ice
###1445 As the ice advanced and retreated,
###1447 it carved out deep fjords
###1449 and indented Iceland's northern coastline
###1454 Ice was a formidable force in Iceland
###1456 and many volcanoes laid at tomb beneath it
###1462 Fire and ice were now locked in a titanic battle of supremacy
###1467 When the giant ice sheets that carved the fjords
###1470 put out the fires that created Iceland
###1479 The first clue lies in this ancient valley, 5 miles (8 Km) west of the glacier
###1485 The valley floor is strewed with hundreds of giant boulders
###1489 but it's how they got here that interests Dr. Roberts
###1494 These boulders provide a lot of insight into how this landscape was formed
###1498 The boulders clusted together and, interestingly,
###1501 this boulders are rounded, which shows they've been rolling
###1504 And the boulders have been brought together by some dynamical force
###1508 We can also see smaller boulders trapped in the center
###1511 And it's quite clear that flowing water is the cause of this
###1514 But this would haven't been water in the stream that we see in the background
###1518 this would have been water produced by a much larger, faster flow
###1523 that would have inundated this entire valley
###1526 Dr. Roberts has an extraordinay theory about what happened here:
###1531 In ancient times, a cataclysmic flood 100 feet (30 m) high cut through this valley
###1538 It was so powerful that it rolled this giant boulders like pebbles in a stream
###1542 before dumping them on the landscape
###1548 But what could create such a colossal flow of water?
###1553 Dr. Roberts suspects the flood came from the mighty Vatnajökull glacier
###1557 and he's hunting for clues
###1561 With such a huge area to cover, Dr. Roberts takes to the air
###1572 His investigation leads him to a crucial peace of evidence:
###1578 This strange bowl-like depression on the surface of the ice
###1583 This is an amazing location. This giant depression in the ice has been formed
###1587 as a pocket of water drained from beneath the base of the ice cap
###1592 The beautiful concentric crevasses that you see on the ice surface were formed
###1596 as the ice slowly crept into the hole of this pit created as the waters drained the way
###1605 Beneath the ice, a dynamic process is happening
###1609 Hot magma and steam are melting the glacier from underneath
###1614 The meltwater collects in a huge ice basin at the top of the volcano
###1620 The basin slowly fills. But as it does, the surrounding ice becomes unstable,
###1628 cracks up here, in the ice basin. And as the hot water drains away,
###1632 it forms a tunnel which channels the water to the edge of the glacier
###1638 This would suggest that volcanic eruptions still happen even under the enormous weight of ice
###1646 Is this process the key to explaining the ancient cataclysmic flood?
###1652 To answer this, we must go to one of Iceland's largest volcanoes:
###1658 Grímsvötn
###1661 Lying entombed beneath the ice in the heart of Vatnajökull
###1664 This massive volcano violently erupts every 10 years
###1671 Here fire and ice spectacularly collide, with Iceland's volcanoes emerging victorious
###1679 Ice cannot supress the invincible power of Iceland's volcanoes
###1683 which have now found a new way to vent their anger
###1689 During a huge eruption like this, Grímsvötn can melt enough ice
###1693 to fill America's largest man-made reservoir: Lake Mead
###1698 But this vast volume of water cannot be held back by the ice for long
###1702 and leads inevitabily to a massive glacial flood
###1708 Such a force of nature struck Iceland in 1996 with devastating consequences,
###1714 the floodwater taking out everyting in its path
###1720 Bridges were torn down and swept away
###1723 and the highway was submerged under water
###1728 The flood itself reached a peak discharge of over 1,8 million cubic feet per second (50.000 m3/s),
###1734 that's a remarkable discharge, prevalent to the summertime discharge of the river Amazon
###1739 Imagine that sort of condition over a relatively small area
###1745 The sheer force of the water carried icebergs the size of 4 storey buildings
###1751 It's floods like these that can change the landscape in a matter of days
###1757 The erosive power of the flowing water can result in tremendous amounts of rock
###1761 being eroded, literally being fractured away by the high water pressure that is being created
###1767 so, literally a landscape can form before your eyes during a very severe glacial flood
###1775 The story of Iceland's bizarre landscape is taking shape
###1780 Striations on rock prove that ice is a formidable force
###1784 that carved out Iceland's unique coastline
###1788 Boulders strewn in an empty valley
###1791 reveal cataclysmic floods of the past
###1794 And depressions in the ice confirm that Iceland's volcanoes could not be supressed
###1801 But 12.000 years ago the great ice sheets retreated
###1804 and Iceland was liberated from their wintery grip,
###1808 Now, the effects of Iceland's volcanoes would be felt on a global scale
###1819 For thusands of years Iceland's volcanoes were locked in a titanic battle with ice
###1825 But then, 12.000 years ago, the giant ice sheets finally retreated
###1832 This would open a new chapter in Iceland's volcanic history,
###1836 as they were now free to wreak havoc
###1840 But, what effect would this have on Iceland and its surroundings?
###1847 One of the most dramatic effects can be found in the south-central region of the island
###1855 This alien landscape is known as Laki
###1861 A road of strange craters and solidified lava flows
###1864 that have bubbled up from a huge tear in the earth
###1868 A massive fissure eruption, it stretches for an astounding 16 miles (25 Km) across the landscape
###1879 Volcanologist Dr. Thor Thordarson is investigating Laki,
###1883 the site of one of the greatest eruptions in recent history,
###1887 one which would have devastating effects worldwide
###1891 The Laki fissures, which extend from here in the southwest,
###1896 continue here through the landscape as roll cones, up in through Mount Laki
###1902 which was split into 2 during the eruption
###1904 and continue futher to the northeast all the way to the margins of the glaciers here
###1912 Eyewitness accounts accurately date the eruption to 1783
###1918 This was one of the most disastrous years in Icelandic history
###1923 Fallout from the eruption caused harvests all over the island to fail
###1928 75% of the livestock died, plunging Iceland into a great famine which killed 10.000 people
###1938 But mysteriously, at the same time the rest of the northern hemisphere
###1942 reported freakishly cold weather
###1947 Averaging 2,3 ºF (1,28ºC) below normal, the northern hemisphere froze over
###1955 The North Sea along the coast of Holland froze,
###1958 so people skated between villages along the coast
###1961 There was on Mississippi down by New Orleans in that winter
###1969 For many years it was thought the Laki eruption and this climatic events were unrelated,
###1975 but advances in geology found it wasn't just a bizarre coincidence
###1981 Comparing eyewitness accounts with the geological remains
###1985 Dr. Thordarson has reconstructed what happened
###1991 He discovered that the eruption started with a bang on the morning of June 8, 1783
###1997 It sent rocks flying high into the air
###2000 and ripped the earth open along a 1 mile (1,6 Km) tear
###2005 But this was just the beginning
###2009 3 days later, a second eruption ripped open, then a 3rd, 4th, 5th...
###2016 In total, the earth unzipped along 10 vast tears in the crust
###2021 erupting lava continuously for over 8 months
###2026 The mammoth amounts of lava that poured out of the ground here
###2030 would have buried Manhattah to a depth of 830 feet (250 m)
###2036 But how an eruption on this small, remote island could cause climatic chaos
###2040 thousands of miles away, remained a mystery
###2047 The evidence that would link Laki with this worldwide catastrophe
###2050 was locked inside these boulders
###2057 The story is in the rocks. This rock here is part of
###2061 the material, the magma that came out during the eruption
###2065 These holes are cold bubbles,
###2068 and they form as the magma raises from deep within the ground and approaches the surface
###2074 and it really starts to boil!
###2076 The gas, which is dissolved in the magma at depth, goes into the bubbles
###2080 then it escapes into the atmosphere
###2084 When this bubble rock erupted onto the surface
###2086 it would have poured gas out into the Icelandic atmosphere
###2094 Could this gas have caused climatic chaos across the globe?
###2102 The identity of this gas can be found in the microscopic structure of the rock
###2107 If you look closely at this rock, you can see a lot of white specks
###2111 these little white specks are the crystals who grow in the magma at depth
###2116 Sometimes this crystals, as they're growing, they would encapsulate
###2119 pristine magma and bring it up to the surface
###2124 Like time capsules, the white crystals contained untouched magma from deep in the earth
###2130 locked away since 1783
###2134 Dr. Thordarson has analysed this magma and found it to contain poisonous Sulphur Dioxide
###2142 And because there was so much lava here, it would have released enormous amounts
###2148 A staggering 100 million tons of Sulphur Dioxide gas was pumped into the atmosphere
###2158 But how could gases released from Laki cause bitterly cold weather across the globe?
###2164 The answer laid in accounts of a thick, red fog reported over Iceland in June 1783
###2172 Within a few weeks it had been blown over London and Paris
###2176 By July, it had dispersed across the entire northern hemisphere
###2182 Scientists now know that the red fog was caused by the Sulphur Dioxide which rose high into the air
###2190 Mixing with water, it created a Sulphuric Acid haze
###2196 The haze blocked out the sun, and it sent temperatures plummeting
###2202 As a result, the northern hemisphere endured 3 bitterly cold winters
###2207 which brought spring floods, famine and widespread poverty to Europe
###2214 Some historians have long believed that these climatic conditions
###2218 triggered social and political unrest, which led to the French Revolution in 1789
###2226 But scientists now suspect Laki had ramifications even further afield
###2232 The cold temperatures in the north changed air currents in the south
###2236 causing dramatic climate changes
###2240 India was hit by a terrible drought
###2243 People say that more than half a million people died from the drought in India
###2250 Also, this change in atmospheric circulation caused a very cold summer in Japan
###2256 It was cold and wet
###2258 The rice harvest failed,
###2261 and the result was the greatest famine in japanese history
###2266 It is estimated that Laki killed over 2 million people worldwide,
###2272 and was one of the most devastating volcanic eruptions in the history of mankind
###2279 The evidence has proven that Iceland's recent volcanic history
###2283 has had a devastating effect on the island and the rest of the world
###2288 Enormous lava fields reveal that Laki was a gigantic eruption
###2294 Bubbles in the rock indicate that huge volumes of gas were released from Laki
###2300 The white crystals reveal that this gas was poisonous Sulphur Dioxide,
###2306 evidence that Iceland's volcanoes caused climatic mayhem across the globe
###2313 But eruptions like Laki may not be confined to the past
###2318 Some believe that the balance between fire and ice is shifting,
###2322 and has the potential to propel Iceland into another hell on earth
###2332 The evidence is mounting, that Iceland has the potential to be the most lethal island on the planet
###2339 A fearsome volcanic force lies beneath it, creating powerful volcanoes
###2344 capable of generating gigantic lava flows and altering global climates
###2352 Yet many of Iceland's volcanoes are covered in glaciers,
###2356 fire and ice are held in a delicate balance
###2361 Scientists fear if this balance were tipped the volcanoes favour,
###2365 Iceland could become even deadlier
###2369 If the remaining ice were to melt,
###2372 what effect would it have on the activity of Iceland's volcanoes?
###2378 The first clue in the investigation lies in these innocuous-looking piles of rock and rubble
###2386 They're found all over Iceland,
###2387 and yet this rocks don't come from a volcano
###2392 They're Morraines:
###2394 The geological term for rock piles deposited at the mouth of a glacier
###2400 These deposits are evidence that the glaciers are shrinking
###2406 Year by year, the glacier has melted and retreated back up the valley,
###2410 leaving a Morraine like this behind
###2419 Dr. Roberts has studied the Vatnajökull glacier for the last ten years
###2422 and has noticed this dramatic trend
###2426 The glacier is retreating at a remarkable rate since I've been visiting the area
###2430 I've seen tremendous changes. The ice has retreated annually at a rate of about
###2434 200 feet (61 m) per year. This lake over here used to be filled with ice
###2440 I've seen the ice progressively melt, this morraine has formed,
###2442 this whole valley has become almost bare
###2446 Maybe in the next 20 years this whole glacier will disappear and a lake will form in that valley
###2452 Iceland's glaciers are melting at an unprecedented rate
###2456 With 5% of Iceland's ice caps melting in the last 40 years,
###2461 the question that scientists are keen to understand
###2464 is: What effect this rapid melting will have on the volcanoes that lie beneath?
###2472 The only other time that glaciers have melted this quickly
###2474 is when Iceland came out of the last Ice Age
###2480 But what can past events tell us about the future?
###2486 Geologist professor Bill McGuire is investigating how volcanic activity changed
###2491 at the end of the last Ice Age
###2494 And he's unearthed some surprising results
###2498 Around about 11 or 12 thousand years ago you started to see quite rapid melting of glaciers
###2504 in Iceland and elsewhere
###2505 And that triggered a recognisable increase of volcanic activity,
###2509 because you were removing this large mass of ice very, very quickly
###2513 The rapid melting of ice kick-starts volcanic eruptions beneath
###2517 Volcanic eruptions are triggered by the gas in the magma,
###2521 which expands to form bubbles and the bubbles drive the eruption
###2524 It's rather like taking the cork out of a bottle of champagne
###2528 Now, if you have a very heavy weight on top of a volcano,
###2531 if it's a heavy mass of water or ice,
###2533 that can help supress eruptive activity
###2538 But when ice melts quickly, this downward pressure is suddenly released
###2542 and that's when the trouble starts
###2546 As the ice melts, so the pressure on the magma underneath is reduced,
###2550 the gas in the magma can form bubbles, they can coalesce and they can eventually
###2554 drive the magma upwards towards the surface and trigger
###2557 other explosive eruptions or effusions of lava that are spared out at a huge distances
###2565 Iceland's glaciers are melting rapidly
###2569 This has led scientists to believe that a devastating eruption on the scale of Laki
###2574 could happen again
###2575 The question is WHEN? These are things that we have to think about
###2579 and try to prepare ourselves to deal with if they happen in our lifetime
###2585 Is it possible that we can get another eruption like this in Iceland?
###2591 Definetely
###2593 The investigation has revealed how the vast and voilent island of Iceland was formed
###2602 Cracks in the Thingvellir plane and traces of chemicals in the rocks
###2606 revealed how the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Hot Spot joined forces to create a collossal volcanic force
###2616 Massive fissure eruptions ripped the land open
###2620 Hemorrhaging millions of tons of lava, Iceland rapidly formed
###2626 Deep northern fjords were evidence that a giant ice sheet eroded the land
###2630 and entombed the volcanoes, locking fire and ice in a titanic battle
###2638 Boulders strewn in an ancient valley reveal how fire emerged victorious
###2644 unleashing cataclysmic floods
###2648 And specks of Sulphur in the rocks showed how Iceland's volcanoes
###2652 have the potential to cause global destruction
###2657 Now, glaciers melting above some of the world's most deadly volcanoes
###2662 are increasing the threat of future eruptions
###2669 Over the last 20 million years, Iceland's almighty volcanic force
###2673 has created a vast, alien landscape
###2678 Volatile and unpredictable, it may one day unleash a massive eruption
###2683 which could devastate both Iceland and a wider world beyond
