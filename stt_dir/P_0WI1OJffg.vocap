###8 (SINGING) Little red corvette.
###10 
###14 See if you can hear me.
###16 PATRICK O'DELL: Yeah I can hear you.
###16 DUSTIN DOLLIN: Can you hear me?
###18 Is that way better?
###20 Can you hear me now?
###21 
###23 Aren't you the fucking filmer?
###26 I'm just a puppet.
###29 PATRICK O'DELL: Hi.
###29 Welcome to the very first episode of the Epicly Later'd
###32 skateboard show.
###33 Today as our first guest we have Dustin Dollin who's
###36 visiting from Australia.
###37 And I'm really excited because Dustin is just like an awesome
###41 skater and he's an insane person.
###43 DUSTIN DOLLIN: This way or that way?
###45 PATRICK O'DELL: He's completely fearless and for
###47 years has just been doing stuff that I think has pushed
###50 progression in skateboarding ahead.
###52 Always getting tricks done.
###53 Always landing everything.
###55 We're just hoping to follow him around, go gear shopping,
###58 skateboarding.
###59 I don't know.
###59 We'll see what we get into.
###61 This is sort of a day in the life of Dustin Dollin.
###66 DUSTIN DOLLIN: The fucking--
###67 it's so hard to find a button-up with like one pocket
###70 with a good print on it these days.
###71 They're all like polyester fuckin' fag seventies shit.
###75 And they have that dude downstairs, the crazy dude
###78 that's been here forever.
###80 Do you have these in a small?
###82 MALE SPEAKER 2: In a small?
###83 DUSTIN DOLLIN: No, it's just what's on the shelf, right?
###86 I like this kind of shit.
###87 [INAUDIBLE].
###88 Just like the old Gothic wallpaper kind of shirt.
###92 MALE SPEAKER 2: Too Gothic?
###94 DUSTIN DOLLIN: Yep.
###95 MALE SPEAKER 2: Here you go!
###98 DUSTIN DOLLIN: It's a bit hot though.
###100 MALE SPEAKER 2: Right.
###101 It's supposed to be hot.
###102 Like in rock-n-roll it's hot.
###104 If it's not hot, what's the point?
###107 Like if your pants don't hurt, why wear them?
###109 We carry this thing, that's Dustin Dollin.
###111 I even know your last name now.
###112 DUSTIN DOLLIN: Oh really.
###113 MALE SPEAKER 2: You're famous.
###113 Yeah.
###114 Upstairs you're famous.
###115 He's famous.
###115 He's really famous.
###116 DUSTIN DOLLIN: No.
###117 MALE SPEAKER 2: Yes!
###118 DUSTIN DOLLIN: I'm not.
###118 MALE SPEAKER 2: Humbly famous.
###121 DUSTIN DOLLIN: Ah, [INAUDIBLE] mob blocks.
###123 These are mob blocks.
###125 Trying to get shit done with these is virtually impossible.
###127 [BELCHING]
###130 It's so funny letting a [INAUDIBLE].
###133 Hated and proud and then like cover it up
###135 with my chick socks.
###136 
###139 SHANNON MARTINEZ: I got nothing to say right now.
###141 I'm jealous.
###141 I don't have any shoes.
###143 DUSTIN DOLLIN: I feel so much better actually
###144 having some gear on.
###146 It's been so long.
###148 It's been skate dude on tour for fucking months and months.
###152 Thank you.
###155 CHAD MUSKA: I know one good story about Dustin.
###157 When we first met, the first time I went to Australia, it
###159 was me and Ronnie Creager.
###160 We went on-- it was a Blind Shorties tour.
###163 And we went to every fuckin' place in Australia, Justin was
###167 probably like 11 or 12 years old or something.
###169 And he showed up at every spot that went to, no matter if we
###173 were on the other side-- we were in Tasmania, to Perth, to
###177 Adelaide, and he showed up at every demo and he was the
###179 hyperest little shit in the world.
###181 And he was kickflip indy grabbing everything in sight
###184 and he was just like, ah, hey mate, hey check this kickflip
###187 indy, aye, aye, aye.
###188 And he was kickflipping everything.
###189 He was just this hyper little fucking rat.
###192 And then I just remember like a couple of years after that
###194 just seeing him and damn, he really fuckin'
###196 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###196 CHAD MUSKA: Came through.
###197 You know?
###197 But I think like he's one of the sickest skaters ever right
###201 now, for sure, man.
###202 PATRICK O'DELL: To me, something that's interesting
###203 about Dustin Dollin is that a lot of pro skaters when they
###206 turn old enough to start drinking they start drinking,
###209 they start doing drugs, they just vanish off the face of
###212 the earth as far as skateboarding coverage goes.
###214 DUSTIN DOLLIN: I'm gonna get run over by cars.
###217 PATRICK O'DELL: Dustin has never slowed down partying and
###220 he's never slowed down skateboarding.
###222 And I know that might be a bad message because trust me,
###224 nobody else has been able to pull this off and I've seen
###228 pros come and go for 10 years.
###230 He's always the first one awake in the morning and the
###233 last one asleep.
###234 [CAR HORN]
###236 DUSTIN DOLLIN: Fuck off!
###238 Fuckin' hell!
###239 What the fuck's wrong with these people?
###241 PATRICK O'DELL: He just seems to have this lust for life
###243 that a lot of people don't have.
###245 DUSTIN DOLLIN: When you like walk past the bar and they're
###247 playing a song that you really like you just got to go in and
###249 have a drink.
###251 KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: Dustin's like the king of pressuring
###253 people who don't drink.
###255 He seriously has a hard time breathing when he's around
###258 people who we know that don't drink.
###261 DUSTIN DOLLIN: One time me and Spanky were in Brooklyn and
###262 we're just like walking down the street talking to each
###265 like, man, I got to take it easy.
###267 I got to slow down on having drinks like this week.
###271 And then we walk past a bar and Morrissey was playing out
###273 of it and we just had to go in and have a drink.
###275 
###278 Times like that, you know?
###279 KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: I guess he probably taught me a new
###281 way to drink or like--
###285 DUSTIN DOLLIN: Afternoon mimosa, huh?
###287 FEMALE SPEAKER: Why not?
###288 DUSTIN DOLLIN: Yeah.
###288 Why not.
###289 FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm gonna find me some
###290 nice big, giant mojito.
###293 DUSTIN DOLLIN: Oh, yeah.
###296 She's like mimosa and a mojito.
###300 I need some washing man.
###301 
###304 It said same day on the laundromat and then the next
###309 day you have to pick it up.
###312 I don't know, it's fucked.
###314 You know what else I hate?
###314 Is in the elevators, they have the button that closes the
###318 door quicker but it never fucking closes it quicker.
###321 Never.
###322 Guys that wear their sunglasses on their head,
###325 that's pretty heinous, especially at night.
###328 That's bad.
###328 People wear strange gear in New York.
###332 I seen girls like wearing most old grandmother
###336 fucking shit ever.
###337 Like the prettiest girls just like ruining their shit by
###341 wearing these big flowery grandmother dresses.
###345 It's stupid.
###347 Lot of girls cover up their tits here like they don't like
###350 showing any of them.
###351 I think it's because they're all models and they're all
###353 skinny and they all got little tits.
###355 I hate lots of things though.
###358 I'm sure a lot of people just hate me.
###359 
###364 Fuck 'em.
###365 Two for one.
###366 I guess I can get my--
###367 [BELCHING]
###369 Get another one for free.
###370 PATRICK O'DELL: When did you first meet Dustin?
###372 SHANNON MARTINEZ: Almost seven years ago at a bar in
###374 Melbourne, in Australia.
###376 We pretty much met because he ran after me and pulled down
###380 my skirt in front of all the Baker crew and through a drink
###384 on my face and I liked it so that's how we met.
###391 PATRICK O'DELL: And you guys started dating right away?
###393 SHANNON MARTINEZ: Yep.
###393 I moved to Sydney after pretty much knowing him for a day.
###396 So I moved into state to live with him for
###398 awhile during the Olympics.
###400 And then I made him come back down to Melbourne.
###402 And he's been there ever since.
###403 DUSTIN DOLLIN: I'm always here just drinking.
###405 I don't know where all you kids are every other fucking
###407 time where I was hanging out at Tompkins having beers.
###410 I didn't think anyone even liked me in New York.
###413 
###416 Professional pile of shit.
###418 PATRICK O'DELL: Did he make some kind of deal with you,
###419 like if you put up with him?
###421 SHANNON MARTINEZ: For five years he'd marry me?
###424 Yeah!
###426 PATRICK O'DELL: What did he say?
###427 How did he put it to you?
###428 SHANNON MARTINEZ: I actually read it in a magazine.
###430 I never heard of the deal.
###433 He made up the deal in a magazine and then I read it
###435 and he told me that's what was going to happen so I don't
###438 know if that's like a prize or punishment or what.
###442 PATRICK O'DELL: How much shit do you think you
###444 have to put up with?
###445 SHANNON MARTINEZ: More than anyone else.
###447 PATRICK O'DELL: Do you think maybe it's almost a relief
###448 when he goes on tour?
###449 SHANNON MARTINEZ: Definitely.
###449 It's the only reason why we're together still.
###451 We usually see each other between eight--
###453 around eight months a year.
###454 And if we didn't have the breaks, we'd kill each other.
###457 Because he's way too torturous.
###458 24 hours a day?
###459 There's no way.
###461 No way.
###462 DUSTIN DOLLIN: Now what do we do?
###464 Let's go get a beer.
###465 
###468 Trying not to throw up, man.
###472 I need to go somewhere private to throw up.
###474 I got to go throw up.
###476 [GAGGING]
###483 [VOMITING]
###490 Kids running over to take pictures of me throwing up.
###492 That's great.
###493 PATRICK O'DELL: What do you think of Dustin Dollin?
###494 TIM O'CONNOR: I like that dude, yep.
###496 Plus he doesn't really give a flying fuck about anything.
###499 A lot of people say they don't give a fuck but he most
###503 definitely doesn't, for sure.
###505 DUSTIN DOLLIN: We're doing a documentary on me drinking.
###509 It's going very well.
###511 FEMALE SPEAKER: It's going to be great.
###512 MALE SPEAKER: Dustin, nice meeting you, man.
###513 DUSTIN DOLLIN: You too, man.
###514 See ya.
###515 
###526 Tell them what the fuck you're wearing I mean while you're
###529 getting it on your ears.
###531 SHANNON MARTINEZ: Huh?
###533 Are you wasted right now after like five beers?
###536 DUSTIN DOLLIN: Three Jagers.
###539 Can I get a tattoo?
###541 FEMALE SPEAKER: Which you want?
###542 DUSTIN DOLLIN: A skull and crossbones in my earlobe.
###545 SHANNON MARTINEZ: No.
###546 You don't do it there?
###547 FEMALE SPEAKER: I've never tattooed there before.
###549 Inside the ear is like way different than below here.
###552 I'm game if you are.
###555 DUSTIN DOLLIN: Isn't there a gay side and a non-gay side?
###557 FEMALE SPEAKER: You know what?
###558 I wish I knew the answer to that.
###560 SHANNON MARTINEZ: The left, apparently.
###560 DUSTIN DOLLIN: The left is non-gay?
###561 SHANNON MARTINEZ: Yeah, apparently.
###563 FEMALE SPEAKER: The left side is non-gay?
###564 DUSTIN DOLLIN: Well I want to get it on the gay side.
###566 
###570 I can't get it right.
###571 The pen's not thin enough but I guess that's how thick
###574 tattoos are.
###574 MALE SPEAKER: You should get that one.
###577 Rat bone.
###579 DUSTIN DOLLIN: It's got to be really tiny.
###580 MALE SPEAKER: You want it that small?
###583 DUSTIN DOLLIN: I'm gonna out it in my ear.
###584 
###586 All these skulls look gay.
###589 We need an evil skull.
###593 That's good.
###593 Even just that is good.
###595 
###605 FEMALE SPEAKER: This is going where inside your ear?
###608 DUSTIN DOLLIN: In there.
###610 MALE SPEAKER: You're gonna go deaf.
###612 DUSTIN DOLLIN: Do you think it'll work?
###613 FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes.
###614 DUSTIN DOLLIN: I bet it won't hurt.
###617 Do you think it'll hurt?
###619 No, I ain't got no pain there.
###620 FEMALE SPEAKER: Really?
###621 
###636 DUSTIN DOLLIN: It's all weird.
###637 It doesn't hurt.
###640 There's nothing.
###640 All you can hear is the sound.
###642 FEMALE SPEAKER: It's done.
###642 DUSTIN DOLLIN: And it's done.
###643 FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###644 You're totally done.
###646 [INAUDIBLE].
###648 
###659 JASON DILL: Dustin's rad, man.
###660 He's just-- he's so psycho.
###661 He'll be like hurt or whatever and you'll think like, god
###664 dammit he can barely fucking kickflip and all of a sudden
###667 he'll like, wah!
###668 Like fucking kickflip fucking frontside flips on some big
###672 ass thing or into some big huge thing and you're just
###674 like, holy shit!
###675 Yeah, he's a maniac.
###678 PATRICK O'DELL: So you think with all this drinking and
###680 everything you still manage to skate a lot?
###683 SHANNON MARTINEZ: Yeah.
###683 DUSTIN DOLLIN: I mean, I've had knee surgery a couple of
###686 times, three times and I don't know, I haven't slowed down.
###692 Still in all the magazines like covers coming out.
###696 It doesn't really affect me.
###699 PATRICK O'DELL: You seem like you're one of the few people
###701 that can get away with-- like so many people that get into
###704 drinking and all this shit and then they just
###707 vanish from the magazines.
###708 DUSTIN DOLLIN: Yeah, well, I mean a lot of people are have
###711 addictive personalities and it just fucks their life up but I
###714 can not drink, I can drink.
###716 I'd rather drink because a lot to do with drinking is it
###720 makes me think of new tricks to do.
###722 It makes me like-- when I wake up hungover, I feel like doing
###725 something weird.
###727 I don't know.
###727 It's hard to explain.
###728 If I don't get a good night out, it's hard for me to have
###730 fun the next day on a skateboard.
###731 If I don't drink and I go out the next day I'm
###734 just like, a zombie.
###737 And then if I drink and I'm kind of still drunk in the
###740 morning I feel like jumping off something.
###742 It's just the way it goes.
###743 KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: He's told me this before.
###745 He wakes up drunk and drinks another beer
###747 and he skates better.
###750 And I've seen him go to a rail, not be able to commit
###752 and he's like, oh no, I'll come back with a few Jack and
###755 Cokes and I'll be able to do it.
###756 And I believed him because I've seen it happen.
###759 DUSTIN DOLLIN: Just drinking, being hungover has never
###761 stopped me from trying to get a trick before so I don't
###764 think it's going to stop me ever unless--
###765 I'll skate as hard as I can until my body will let me.
###768
