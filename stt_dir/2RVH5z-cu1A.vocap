###32 DITULLIO: HELLO AND WELCOME TO
###33 SPORTSZONE. I'M JOHN DITULLIO.
###35 LAST NOVEMBER ALUMNUS STEVE
###36 SCHULTZ DONATED ONE MILLION
###38 DOLLARS TO RIT OFFICIALLY
###40 KICKING OFF THE SCHOOL'S POWER
###42 PLAY CAMPAIGN TO HELP FUND THE
###44 CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW ARENA HERE
###45 ON CAMPUS FOR HOCKEY. NOW ONE
###47 YEAR LATER RIT'S POWER PLAY HAS
###50 SCORED ITS MOST SIGNIFICANT
###51 DONATION YET. SHELBY HILL HAS
###59 THE LATEST. HILL: CONSTRUCTION
###60 ON THE FUTURE HOME OF RIT HOCKEY
###62 HASN'T EVEN BEGUN, BUT THE NEW
###64 FACILITY ALREADY HAS A NAME,
###66 THANKS TO A 4.5 MILLION DOLLAR
###68 PARTNERSHIP WITH THE POLISSENI
###69 FOUNDATION AND TOM GOLISANO, THE
###71 HOCKEY PROGRAM WILL SOON CALL
###73 THE GENE POLISSENI CENTER THEIR
###75 NEW HOME. DESTLER: THIS IS AN
###76 AMAZING STORY AND WE JUST
###77 COULDN'T HAVE A BETTER NAME FOR
###79 THIS ARENA. YOU KNOW, GENE
###80 POLISSENI AND TOM GOLISANO WERE
###82 CHILDHOOD FRIENDS. WHEN TOM
###85 GOLISANO DECIDED THAT HE WAS
###86 GOING TO TRY AND START A
###87 COMPANY, WHICH EVENTUALLY BECAME
###89 PAYCHEX, TOGETHER THEY BUILT THE
###90 COMPANY INTO WHAT IT IS TODAY.
###93 IT'S A TREMENDOUS STORY OF
###94 PERSONAL FRIENDSHIP, HARD WORK,
###96 PERSEVERANCE AND I THINK RIT OF
###98 COURSE IS THE BENEFICIARY OF
###101 THAT EXTRAORDINARY RELATIONSHIP,
###103 AND WHAT A BETTER WAY TO HONOR
###104 GENE POLISSENI'S MEMORY THAN TO
###106 HAVE HIS NAME ON THIS
###107 MAGNIFICENT NEW FACILITY. HILL:
###108 NOW WHAT DOES THIS DONATION SAY
###110 TO THE POLISSENIS AND TOM
###110 GOLISANO'S COMMITMENT TO THE
###112 COMMUNITY? WILSON: WELL, I
###113 THINK, AND MAYBE NOT AS
###115 PUBLICIZED ALL THE TIME THE
###116 MONEY THAT THEY CERTAINLY HELP
###120 OUT MANY, MANY CAUSES THROUGHOUT
###123 OUR COMMUNITY. THE COMMUNITY IS
###124 VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM. THESE
###127 ARE PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW,
###128 ROCHESTER'S VERY SPECIAL TO THEM
###130 AND REALLY HELP ROCHESTER
###133 THRIVE. WE REALLY, REALLY
###135 APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THAT
###136 THEY'VE DONE. HILL: HOW
###137 GRATIFYING IS THIS TO YOU AND
###139 THE CAMPAIGN? DESTLER: YOU KNOW,
###140 IT COULDN'T BE BETTER! IT'S
###141 EXACTLY THE BIG GIFT WE NEEDED
###143 TO GET THIS CAMPAIGN GOING. I
###145 THINK WE'RE OVER HALFWAY THERE
###147 NOW. I THINK THIS WILL BUILD
###149 EXCITEMENT TOWARD THE CAMPAIGN
###150 AND HOPEFULLY IF WE RAISE A
###152 COUPLE MILLION DOLLARS MORE,
###153 THIS SPRING WILL GET AN
###155 ARCHITECT AND MAYBE IF WE GET A
###157 COUPLE MILLION AFTER THAT WE'LL
###158 START CONSTRUCTION IN THE FALL.
###159 HILL: SO HOW MUCH HAVE YOU
###160 RAISED SO FAR? DESTLER: A LITTLE
###162 OVER EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS AND
###163 WE'RE VERY ENCOURAGED BY WHAT WE
###165 HEAR FROM THE COMMUNITY. WE HAVE
###166 SOME OTHER LARGE ASKS OUT. IT'S
###168 NO QUESTION, WE'RE REALLY GOING
###169 TO BUILD THIS THING, THE ONLY
###170 QUESTION IS WHEN. HILL: NOW DO
###172 YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO START
###173 BUILDING BEFORE YOU GET THE 15
###175 MILLION OR WAIT UNTIL THEN? NEW
###176 SPEAKER: WELL NOW THAT WE HAVE A
###177 NAME FOR THE CENTER, IT MAKES IT
###179 EASIER FOR US TO START LOOKING
###180 FORWARD TO GETTING AN ARCHITECT
###182 AND THINKING ABOUT THE PLACEMENT
###184 AND MAKING SOME MORE FIRM PLANS
###185 TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. IT'S
###186 EXCITING! HILL: WHAT DOES THIS
###188 DO TO THE MOMENTUM OF THE
###190 CAMPAIGN? DESTLER: IT'S A BIG
###191 SURGE, LET'S PUT IT THAT WAY.
###193 YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU GET A 4.5
###195 MILLION DOLLAR GIFT IT SENDS A
###197 MESSAGE OUT TO FOLKS THAT WE'RE
###199 SERIOUS, WE'VE GOT SOME PEOPLE
###200 BEHIND US WHO ARE SERIOUS ABOUT
###202 IT AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO
###204 DEVELOP KIND OF A SNOWBALL, A
###205 LITTLE DOMINO EFFECT, WE'LL GET
###207 MORE GIFTS, BIGGER GIFTS,
###208 HOPEFULLY. WE'LL GET TO THAT 15
###211 MILLION DOLLAR POINT SOONER THAN
###212 WE THINK. HILL: ARE YOU TALKING
###214 TO SOME OTHER MAJOR COMPANIES
###215 AND IS THERE ANOTHER MAJOR
###217 DONATION IN THE WORKS? DESTLER:
###219 WE HAVE SEVERAL THINGS IN THE
###220 WORKS, THEY'RE NOT NEARLY AS BIG
###221 AS THIS, BUT WE HAVE QUITE A FEW
###223 THINGS IN THE WORKS AND YOU
###224 KNOW, THEY ALL ADD UP AND WE'RE
###227 GOING TO GET THERE AND I
###230 COULDN'T BE MORE THRILLED, NOT
###232 ONLY WITH THIS WONDERFUL DAY AND
###233 THIS WONDERFUL ANNOUNCEMENT, BUT
###234 THE TEAM'S PLAYING WELL TONIGHT,
###235 SO WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE? HILL: IS
###237 IT KIND OF HITTING YOU THAT A
###238 NEW RINK IS GOING TO COME TO
###239 CAMPUS? WILSON: YEAH, IT IS, I
###240 MEAN WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT
###242 FOR A WHILE AND VERY HOPEFUL AND
###244 WE'VE HAD SOME VERY GENEROUS
###246 GIFTS ALREADY AND THE THING THAT
###248 I GUESS I APPRECIATE MORE THAN
###250 ANYTHING ELSE OR I THINK
###252 ESPECIALLY ABOUT THIS IS THAT
###253 IT'S COMING FROM PEOPLE WITH
###255 SINCERE INTEREST IN HOCKEY, AND
###256 I THINK IT MAKES IT THAT MUCH
###257 MORE MEANINGFUL. THE NAME GENE
###258 POLISSENI WILL LIVE ON FOR A
###260 LONG, LONG TIME AND IT WILL BE A
###261 VERY SPECIAL BUILDING IN OUR
###262 COMMUNITY. NEW SPEAKER: WHEN YOU
###264 SEE THE PRESIDENT STANDING OUT
###264 THERE SAYING THAT THIS THING IS
###266 GOING TO BECOME A REALITY, AND I
###267 KIND OF WATCHED, I LOOKED UP IN
###270 THE STANDS AND I JUST SAW THE
###272 EXCITEMENT IN THEIR EYES AND
###274 THEIR VOICES. WHAT WE HAVE HERE
###278 IS A PRETTY DARN SPECIAL THING.
###280 NOW WE HAVE THE GENE POLISSENI
###282 CENTER; WE'LL HAVE PEOPLE WHO
###285 KNEW ABOUT GENE, HIS WORK, HIS
###287 CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE COMMUNITY.
###289 I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS CAN'T
###293 SUCCEED NOW. DITULLIO: TO DATE
###295 RIT HAS RAISED OVER HALF OF THE
###297 CAMPAIGN'S 15 MILLION DOLLAR
###298 GOAL. NOW FOR MORE INFORMATION
###300 ON HOW YOU CAN JOIN THE EFFORT
###302 TO HELP BUILD THE GENE POLISSENI
###307 CENTER, VISIT RIT.EDU/POWERPLAY.
###308 WELL STILL TO COME ON
###309 SPORTSZONE, A FAMILIAR FACE
###310 RETURNS TO THE ICE AFTER A FIVE
###312 GAME SUSPENSION AND MEN'S SOCCER
###314 PLAYS FOR ITS FIRST LIBERTY
###316 LEAGUE TITLE. HIGHLIGHTS ARE ON
###317 THE WAY. YOU'RE WATCHING RIT
###338 WELCOME BACK TO SPORTSZONE.
###339 SINCE 2007, RIT AND AIR FORCE
###342 HAVE BEEN THE TEAMS TO BEAT IN
###344 ATLANTIC HOCKEY, WITH THE
###345 FALCONS CLAIMING FOUR AHA CROWNS
###347 AND THE TIGERS EARNING ONE. RIT
###349 WELCOMED THEIR RIVALS TO
###350 ROCHESTER FOR THE FIRST TIME
###352 THIS SEASON LOOKING TO HALT THE
###353 FALCONS SEVEN GAME UNBEATEN
###355 STREAK. BATTAGLIA: EVERYONE
###356 TAKING A LOOK AT SHANE MADOLORA.
###358 HOW ABOUT THE APPLAUSE, JOHNNY,
###360 FOR SHANE MADOLORA TONIGHT.
###361 DITULLIO: SHANE MADOLORA BACK IN
###362 NET AFTER SITTING OUT FIVE
###363 GAMES, MORE ON HIM IN A MOMENT.
###364 LATE FIRST PERIOD ADAM MITCHELL
###365 SHOT IS STOPPED BUT BRYAN POTTS
###369 IS THERE TO PUT HOME THE
###370 REBOUND. ONE NOTHING RIT AFTER
###372 ONE. SECOND PERIOD, MITCHELL
###374 FORCES A TURNOVER, MIKE
###375 COLAVECCHIA FINDS POTTS, CROSS
###377 ICE FOR HIS SECOND OF THE NIGHT,
###380 RIT LED TWO ZIP. SHANE MADOLORA
###381 STOPPED 25 OF THE 26 SHOTS HE
###383 FACED AS RIT HELD ON TO BEAT AIR
###386 FORCE AS THEIR NUMBER ONE GOALIE
###388 MADE A SUCCESSFUL RETURN TO THE
###394 LINEUP. HILL: SHANE MADOLORA
###395 RETURNED TO THE LINEUP TONIGHT
###396 AFTER SERVING A FIVE GAME
###398 SUSPENSION FOR VIOLATING AN NCAA
###400 RULE. THE INFRACTION INCURRED IN
###402 2009, WHEN MADOLORA FORGOT TO
###404 OFFICIALLY ASK THE NCAA TO
###406 CERTIFY HIM FOR COMING TO RIT.
###408 BUT NOW WITH THAT BEHIND HIM,
###410 MADOLORA AND THE TIGERS ARE
###421 READY TO MOVE FORWARD. YOU WERE
###422 BACK IN THE NET TONIGHT; WHAT
###423 WERE YOU THINKING? MADOLORA: I
###425 SORT OF GOT REALLY EXCITED WHEN
###426 I CAME OUT BECAUSE LIKE I SAID,
###428 THE FANS WERE CHANTING MY NAME
###431 AND ALL THAT, BUT I HAD TO CALM
###432 MYSELF DOWN AND JUST REMEMBER
###433 THAT IT'S ANOTHER HOCKEY GAME.
###434 I'VE BEEN PLAYING HOCKEY MY
###435 WHOLE LIFE, SO I HAD TO SETTLE
###436 BACK DOWN AND GET BACK INTO THE
###438 GROOVE OF THINGS AND FOCUS ON
###440 THE FIRST SHOT OF THE GAME.
###441 HILL: YOU DIDN'T PLAY FOR FIVE
###443 GAMES. CAN YOU TELL ME THE
###444 REASONING BEHIND THAT? MADOLORA:
###445 I GUESS IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO
###446 WITH THE CLEARINGHOUSE AND THE
###447 NCAA AND THEY SAID THAT WHEN I
###448 WAS GOING THROUGH THE WHOLE
###450 PROCESS OF CLEARINGHOUSE THAT I
###452 DIDN'T SIGN A WAIVER OR CHECK A
###454 BOX OR SOMETHING, SO I GUESS
###456 THEY DEEMED THAT A FIVE GAME
###459 SUSPENSION. WILSON: REALLY, HE
###461 TOOK A WRONG SCIENCE COURSE, HE
###463 TOOK AN AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
###464 CLASS. HIS DAD'S A FARMER OUT IN
###466 CALIFORNIA, AND IT DID NOT COUNT
###469 TOWARDS THE REQUIRED THREE
###470 SCIENCES THAT HE NEEDED TO TAKE.
###472 HE SAT OUT THE YEAR AND THEN
###474 WHEN HE CAME IN, HE DID ALL HIS
###476 PAPERWORK. HE WAS CLEARLY
###478 ELIGIBLE, BUT WHAT HE FORGOT TO
###479 DO WAS CHECK A BOX BASICALLY
###482 THAT SAYS REQUESTING TO BE
###484 REINSTATED. THAT'S ABOUT THE
###486 BEST I CAN EXPLAIN IT. FOR HIM I
###487 GUESS THE PUNISHMENT WAS FIVE
###489 GAMES BECAUSE HE PLAYED FIVE
###490 GAMES. THANK GOD HE DIDN'T PLAY
###492 30 GAMES. HILL: WHEN YOU HEARD
###493 THE NEWS THAT SHANE WASN'T GOING
###494 TO BE PLAYING FOR A FEW GAMES,
###496 HOW DID YOU AND THE TEAM REACT?
###497 NEW SPEAKER: I THINK IT JUST
###498 KIND OF BLINDSIDED US. WE REALLY
###499 HAD NO IDEA. WE FOUGHT THROUGH
###501 IT WELL. OBVIOUSLY SHANE'S OUR
###504 GO TO GOALIE RIGHT NOW AND HE'S
###506 PROVEN WELL AND IT'S NICE TO
###507 HAVE HIM BACK IN THE LINEUP, BUT
###509 JUST FOR A LITTLE TIME THERE IT
###510 WAS A LITTLE WEIRD. NO ONE
###511 REALLY KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON
###513 AND THEN THERE WERE JUST RUMORS
###514 HERE AND THERE AND WE KIND OF
###515 FIGURED IT OUT AND THAT'S THAT.
###516 NEW SPEAKER: WE TRIED TO STAY
###517 POSITIVE ABOUT THE WHOLE
###518 SITUATION. I DON'T KNOW ALL THE
###520 DETAILS, BUT SHANE'S A GREAT
###521 GOALIE, HE'S THE BEST IN THE
###522 LEAGUE AND HE SHOWED IT AGAIN
###523 TONIGHT. HILL: WAS IT HARD TO
###525 WATCH YOUR TEAM AND YOU COULDN'T
###526 DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT? MADOLORA:
###527 YEAH, IT WAS DEFINITELY
###528 FRUSTRATING TO COME TO THE GAME
###530 AND TO HAVE TO SIT IN THE STANDS
###531 AND HAVE PEOPLE COME AND ASK
###533 YOU, "WHY AREN'T YOU PLAYING?
###534 WHAT'S GOING ON?" EVERY SINGLE
###536 GAME FOR WHAT SEEMED LIKE A HALF
###538 HOUR STRAIGHT ALMOST, BUT IT WAS
###540 DEFINITELY FRUSTRATING TO HAVE
###541 TO SIT THERE AND WATCH,
###542 ESPECIALLY WHEN WE WERE
###543 STRUGGLING A BIT FOR A FEW
###544 GAMES. IT WAS HARD; IT WAS
###545 DIFFICULT. HILL: HOW GOOD DOES
###546 IT FEEL TO HAVE SHANE BACK?
###548 WILSON: GOOD. COMFORTING THAT
###549 YOU'VE GOT YOUR NUMBER ONE
###550 GOALIE BACK, SOMEONE THAT YOU
###552 CAN RELY ON, SOMEONE THAT'S BEEN
###553 TESTED, SOMEONE THAT'S PROVEN
###555 HIMSELF, CERTAINLY LAST YEAR AND
###557 EVE IN SOME GAMES AND THE YEAR
###558 BEFORE. NEW SPEAKER: SHANE OVER
###560 THE LAST YEAR OR YEAR AND A
###562 HALF, HE'S PLAYED REAL WELL FOR
###565 US. HE'S A GAMER, AND HAVING HIM
###567 BACK IN THE NET TONIGHT HE
###568 SHOWED WHY HE'S THE NUMBER ONE
###569 GUY. HE PLAYED REAL WELL. HILL:
###571 NOW WITH SHANE GONE FOR ALMOST A
###572 MONTH, WERE YOU WORRIED HE MIGHT
###573 BE A LITTLE RUSTY COMING BACK
###575 IN? WILSON: I THOUGHT MAYBE HE
###576 WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT RUSTY AND
###578 THEN MAYBE JUST PRESSING A
###579 LITTLE BIT. HE WAS HIS OLD SELF.
###581 HE JUST KIND OF PLAYS VERY
###583 STRONG AND HE DOES A GREAT JOB.
###585 HE DOES GIVE US CONFIDENCE AND I
###587 THINK WE'RE ABLE TO BUILD OFF OF
###589 THAT AND A COUPLE SAVES EARLY IN
###591 THE GAME I THINK SOLIDIFIES THAT
###593 FOR US AND HE WAS GOOD TO HAVE.
###594 HILL: WHAT DOES IT DO FOR THE
###595 TEAM'S CONFIDENCE, NOT ONLY TO
###596 HAVE YOU BACK, BUT YOU KNOW,
###597 BEAT AIR FORCE, A BIG RIVAL? NEW
###598 SPEAKER: IT WAS A HUGE
###599 CONFIDENCE BOOST JUST BECAUSE
###601 AIR FORCE BEAT US LAST YEAR IN
###602 THE PLAYOFFS AND THEN THEY EVEN
###604 WENT ON TO THE REGIONALS, SO
###606 THEY'RE ALWAYS A TEAM THAT'S
###607 GOING TO BE AT THE TOP OF THE
###608 LEAGUE AND UNTIL WE GET TO THE
###609 REGIONALS, THAT'S THE TEAM WE
###610 HAVE TO GO THROUGH. NEW SPEAKER:
###611 IT WAS A BIG WIN FOR US. WE WERE
###612 IN A LITTLE BIT OF A RUT THERE
###614 AND TWO BIG WINS, WE'VE HAD TWO
###616 GOOD WEEKENDS IN A ROW AND
###618 HOPEFULLY WE CAN MOVE ON FROM
###619 THERE. HILL: HOW MUCH OF A
###621 WEIGHT IS OFF OF YOUR SHOULDERS
###622 NOW THAT YOU'RE BACK ON THE ICE?
###623 MADOLORA: A HUGE WEIGHT! BECAUSE
###623 TO START OFF I WAS DOWN ON
###625 MYSELF JUST BECAUSE I WAS
###628 SUSPENDED, I DIDN'T KNOW WHY, I
###630 DIDN'T KNOW HOW LONG AND JUST
###631 ALL THE UNKNOWNS ARE JUST
###632 DIFFICULT AND FRUSTRATING AND
###634 NOW THAT I'M BACK IT FEELS LIKE
###636 A WEIGHT'S BEEN LIFTED OFF MY
###637 SHOULDERS AND I CAN JUST FOCUS
###638 ON PLAYING AND THE REST OF THE
###639 YEAR AND THE REST OF THE SCHOOL
###646 YEAR TOO. DITULLIO: AHEAD ON
###647 SPORTSZONE: FROM RIT TO THE
###649 SILVER SCREEN, WE'RE GOING TO
###650 SHOW YOU HOW THIS FORMER NTID
###652 STUDENT'S LIFE STORY IS
###655 INSPIRING COUNTLESS INDIVIDUALS.
###674 1755 HILL: MATT HAMILL WAS THE
###675 FIRST DEAF WRESTLER TO WIN A
###677 NATIONAL COLLEGIATE
###678 CHAMPIONSHIP. AND THE FORMER RIT
###679 STUDENT WAS ALSO THE FIRST DEAF
###681 STUDENT TO PARTICIPATE IN MIXED
###683 MARTIAL ARTS. THROUGH THE YEARS,
###684 HAMILL'S BEEN AN INSPIRATION TO
###686 MANY, BY OVERCOMING ADVERSITY TO
###688 MAKE HIS DREAMS COME TRUE. NOW,
###690 AFTER YEARS OF PRODUCTION, HIS
###692 LIFE STORY, FILLED WITH MANY UPS
###693 AND DOWNS, HAS FINALLY HIT THE
###702 BIG SCREEN. NEW SPEAKER: OK,
###708 WE'RE ROLLING, AND ACTION! HILL:
###710 IT'S BEEN OVER TWO YEARS SINCE
###712 THE BRIGHT LIGHTS OF HOLLYWOOD
###713 CAME TO RIT TO FEATURE ONE OF
###715 OUR OWN. NEW SPEAKER: HE WAS
###717 ALWAYS THE CENTER OF ATTENTION
###719 WHEREVER WE WENT, WHEREVER WE
###721 TRAVELED, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE, YOU
###722 COULD ALWAYS HEAR THEM WHISPER
###723 UNDER THEIR BREATH, "OH, THAT'S
###726 MATT HAMILL! I'VE GOT TO WATCH
###727 HIM WRESTLE!" HILL: MATT HAMILL,
###728 A FORMER RIT NTID STUDENT AND
###731 THREE TIME DIVISION THREE
###732 WRESTLING CHAMPION FIRST CAUGHT
###734 HOLLYWOOD PRODUCER'S ATTENTION
###735 WHEN HE BECAME A CONTESTANT ON
###737 THE ULTIMATE FIGHTER REALITY
###739 SHOW. NEW SPEAKER: MY WRITING
###742 PARTNER, EBAN CASPAR, SAW IT ON
###743 THE UFC REALITY SHOW A FEW YEARS
###744 BACK, AND THOUGHT MATT WAS AN
###747 INSPIRING GUY HIMSELF AND WE
###750 LOOKED INTO IT, WE TRACKED HIM
###752 DOWN, MET HIM, INTERVIEWED HIM,
###754 THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA
###756 FOR A SCRIPT AND WROTE THE
###758 SCRIPT. I THINK THE WRITING
###759 PROCESS WAS DIFFICULT IN THE
###761 BEGINNING BECAUSE TO TRY TO
###765 EXPLAIN TO SOMEONE, WE'RE GOING
###766 TO WRITE YOUR LIFE STORY BUT
###768 WE'RE GOING TO JUST FIT IT INTO
###769 A THREE ACT STRUCTURE AND IN AN
###771 HOUR AND A HALF FILM. NEW
###772 SPEAKER: WE'RE GOING TO COMBINE
###773 YOUR DAD AND YOUR GRANDFATHER
###774 INTO ONE CHARACTER. HILL: NOT
###776 ONLY IS HIS STORY UNIQUE, THE
###777 FINAL RESULT IS THE FIRST OF ITS
###782 KIND. NEW SPEAKER: ONE OF THE
###782 REALLY COOL THINGS I THINK THAT
###784 WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS
###785 PROJECT FROM THE BEGINNING IS
###786 THAT IT'S GOING TO BE TOTALLY
###787 SUBTITLED SO THE HEARING PEOPLE
###789 WILL BE ABLE TO HEAR THE
###790 ENGLISH, BUT THEY'LL HAVE TO
###790 READ THE SUBTITLES FOR THE ASL
###792 AND VICE VERSA FOR THE DEAF
###793 PEOPLE. NEW SPEAKER: I TOLD YOU
###795 YOUR WHOLE LIFE YOU DON'T HAVE
###797 YTO BE TREATED DIFFERENT! NEWE
###798 SPEAKER: BUT I AM DIFFERENT! NEW
###799 SPEAKER: THERE AREN'T A LOT OF
###801 MOVIES THAT YOU CAN GO TO THE
###802 THEATER AND WATCH HEARING AND
###803 DEAF TOGETHER UNLESS THEY'RE
###803 FOREIGN FILMS BECAUSE THE DEAF
###804 PEOPLE NEED THE SUBTITLES, SO
###805 IT'S KIND OF THIS ONE OF A KIND
###807 MOVIE WHERE DEAF PEOPLE AND
###808 HEARING PEOPLE CAN WATCH IT
###809 TOGETHER IN THE THEATER. HILL:
###811 AFTER YEARS OF PRODUCTION, THE
###812 MOVIE TITLED "THE HAMMER", AFTER
###814 HAMILL HIMSELF, HAS ALREADY WON
###816 EIGHT FILM FESTIVAL AWARDS AND
###818 HAS FINALLY HIT THE BIG SCREEN
###820 IN OVER A HUNDRED THEATERS
###822 NATIONWIDE. NEW SPEAKER: LET ME
###824 TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE A HIGHLY
###825 INTELLIGENT GRANDSON WHO'S
###827 PROFOUNDLY DEAF. NEW SPEAKER:
###830 ALREADY WE'VE GONE EIGHT FOR
###832 EIGHT IN FILM FESTIVALS, WHICH
###833 IS AWESOME. I THINK IT WAS AFI
###838 IN CALIFORNIA, MAUI, CLEVELAND.
###840 WE JUST WANT IT TO HIT THE RIGHT
###841 AUDIENCES AND KIND OF BRIDGE THE
###843 GAP AND HAVE IT BE A "THE
###845 BLINDSIDE" MEETS "ROCKY" MEETS
###847 "RUDY" TYPE OF FILM. NEW
###848 SPEAKER: WE KNEW THE FILM WAS
###849 SPECIAL FROM THE BEGINNING. AND
###850 EVERYBODY'S BEEN INVOLVED WITH
###852 IT, ESPECIALLY I MYSELF WAS VERY
###853 LATE IN THE PROCESS, BUT IT'S
###855 BEEN PHENOMENAL TO SEE THAT
###856 EVERYBODY ELSE IS COMING OUT AND
###857 SUPPORTING IT AND THE VAST
###859 MAJORITY OF THOSE AWARDS CAME
###861 NOT FROM CRITICS, BUT THEY CAME
###862 FROM THE AUDIENCE MEMBERS
###865 THEMSELVES WHO LOVED THE FILM
###866 AND JUST WANT TO SEE IT SUCCEED.
###871 (CHEERING) HILL: WHAT'S IT LIKE
###872 FOR YOU, THIS FEELING THAT YOU
###873 HAVE NOW THAT YOUR LIFE IS MADE
###876 INTO A MOVIE? HAMILL: WELL,
###881 YEAH, IT'S SOMETHING THAT, UHM,
###884 IT'S SO WEIRD, IT'S REALLY
###885 WEIRD, BECAUSE IT WAS A STRANGE
###887 THING TO ME. I THINK IT'S BEST
###889 TO (INAUDIBLE). I MEAN, LET'S GO
###891 BACK A LITTLE BIT. THIS MOVIE,
###894 "THE HAMMER", IT TOOK US SIX
###896 YEARS FOR THIS PROJECT. I
###897 THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, IT WON'T BE
###900 REALLY SPECIAL OR ELSE I THOUGHT
###901 IT WOULD BE REAL SHORT
###903 (INAUDIBLE).I REALIZED THAT THE
###905 MOVIE PRODUCERS DID NOT GIVE UP,
###906 BUT OVERALL, YOU KNOW, WOW! IT'S
###908 VERY SPECIAL. IT'S A SPECIAL
###911 MOMENT YOU KNOW, TO HAVE
###913 SOMETHING YOU KNOW, ABOUT MY
###915 LIFE SHOWN ROUND THE WORLD. IT'S
###918 REALLY AMAZING. HILL: HAMILL'S
###919 STORY WILL CERTAINLY SERVE AS AN
###921 INSPIRATION TO BOTH THE DEAF AND
###922 HEARING COMMUNITY. NEW SPEAKER:
###923 YOU KNOW I HOPE THAT THEY JUST
###925 ENJOY THE FILM AND FEEL GOOD
###926 ABOUT IT. OBVIOUSLY THE MESSAGE
###927 IS ABOUT OVERCOMING STRUGGLES AT
###928 ANY POINT IN YOUR LIFE. I
###930 HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM UNTIL
###932 TONIGHT, BUT THE PARTS I'VE SEEN
###933 ARE REALLY UPLIFTING AND YOU
###935 KNOW, IT'S A GREAT MESSAGE AND I
###937 THINK IT COMES AT A PRETTY COOL
###938 TIME. HILL: ALTHOUGH MATT HAMILL
###939 HAS ACHIEVED SO MUCH IN HIS
###941 LIFE, AT THE YOUNG AGE OF 35, HE
###943 SAYS THERE'S STILL MORE TO COME.
###945 HAMILL: I'M STILL RETIRED FROM
###948 UFC, BUT I'M GOING TO SEE WHAT
###949 HAPPENS AFTER CHRISTMAS. I HAVE
###952 A TORN ROTATOR CUFF. I'M JUST
###954 GOING TO LET IT FLOW AND SEE HOW
###956 IT GOES FROM THERE. I'M 35. I
###959 DON'T WANT TO REGRET WHEN I GET
###961 OLDER, I'M JUST HOPING THERE
###963 MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT OF A SPARK
###965 (INAUDIBLE)BUT RIGHT NOW I'M
###967 JUST TAKING CARE OF MY BODY.
###969 HILL: YOU'RE A MOTIVATIONAL
###971 SPEAKER, YOU'RE A UFC FIGHTER,
###972 YOU CAN SPEAK SIX LANGUAGES,
###974 LIKE FOR YOU, WHAT IS YOUR
###976 BIGGEST ACCOMPLISHMENT? HAMILL:
###979 WELL, I'M STILL NOT SATISFIED;
###981 I'M STILL NOT SATISFIED. IF
###985 EVERYBODY COULD SEE MY EYES,
###986 YOU'D KNOW I'M JUST NOT REALLY
###987 HAPPY, BUT I STILL HAVE MORE TO
###990 PROVE TO A LOT OF THE WORLD. I
###992 STILL HAVE SOMETHING TO PROVE,
###994 BUT LET'S WAIT AND THERE'S
###996 SOMETHING BIG IN THE WORKS FOR
###1017 AND AUTO. HILL: IN JUST THEIR
###1018 FIRST SEASON IN THE LIBERTY
###1020 LEAGUE, THE RIT MEN'S SOCCER
###1021 TEAM PROVED THEY BELONG. THE
###1023 TIGERS SHUT OUT NINTH RANKED
###1024 HOBART IN THE LEAGUE SEMIFINAL
###1026 EARNING THE RIGHT TO HOST THE
###1027 CONFERENCE TITLE GAME. DITULLIO:
###1029 TIGERS HOSTING VASSAR, A TEAM
###1031 THEY BEAT TWO NOTHING EARLIER
###1032 THIS YEAR, BUT VASSAR CONTROLLED
###1034 THINGS EARLY. THE FIFTH MINUTE,
###1035 OFF THE CORNER KICK, JULIANO
###1037 PEREIRA FINDS THE TOP RIGHT
###1039 CORNER TO GIVE THE BREWERS AN
###1041 EARLY ONE NOTHING LEAD. RIT
###1042 WOULD ANSWER, THE 28TH MINUTE
###1043 OFF THE THROW IN, MATT BROEDEL
###1045 WITH THE CHANCE AND HE PUTS IT
###1047 IN TO KNOT THE GAME AT ONE.
###1048 (CHEERING) SECOND HALF TIED AT
###1049 TWO, THE 85TH MINUTE OFF THE
###1050 FREE KICK, ZANDER MRLIK ELEVATES
###1051 AND HEADS IN THE EVENTUAL GAME
###1053 WINNER AS VASSAR ENDS RIT'S
###1056 SEASON WITH A THREE TWO VICTORY.
###1060 HILL: THE RIT MEN'S SOCCER TEAM
###1063 SUCCESSFUL RUN IN A NEW LEAGUE
###1065 ENDED IN DISAPPOINTMENT. THE RIT
###1067 TIGERS WERE DEFEATED THREE TWO
###1069 AGAINST VASSAR TO LOSE THE
###1070 LIBERTY LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP AND
###1076 A BID TO THE NCAA TOURNAMENT.
###1082 (CHEERING) SO IT WASN'T THE
###1084 IDEAL OUTCOME, BUT WHAT DOES IT
###1085 MEAN TO YOU TO HAVE SUCH A GREAT
###1087 SEASON AND COME TO THE
###1088 CHAMPIONSHIP YOUR FIRST TIME IN
###1089 THE LIBERTY LEAGUE? NEW SPEAKER:
###1090 IT WAS GREAT FOR THE TEAM. YOU
###1091 KNOW, WE WANTED TO GO OUT STRONG
###1093 AND YOU KNOW, MOST OF THE TEAMS
###1095 IN THE LIBERTY LEAGUE DIDN'T
###1096 EXPECT US TO DO WHAT WE DID AND
###1097 I'M PROUD OF OUR BOYS, THE
###1099 COACHING STAFF, EVERYBODY, WE
###1100 GAVE IT OUR ALL AND IT'S TRAGIC
###1102 THE WAY IT ENDED, BUT IT WAS
###1103 STILL A GREAT RUN AND WE LOOK
###1105 FORWARD TO SEEING THEM HERE NEXT
###1106 YEAR AGAIN. NEW SPEAKER: WE WANT
###1107 TO WIN CHAMPIONSHIPS. TODAY WE
###1109 HAD A SHOT; DIDN'T PLAY OUR BEST
###1112 GAME AND RAN INTO A TEAM THAT'ST
###1114 BEEN FLYING LATELY AND HATS OFF
###1116 TO THEM. UNFORTUNATE FOR US
###1121 TODAY. HILL: BEATING VASSAR TWO
###1123 NOTHING EARLIER IN THE SEASON,
###1124 DO YOU THINK IT MADE YOU GUYS A
###1125 LITTLE TOO OVERCONFIDENT COMING
###1127 INTO TODAY'S GAME? NEW SPEAKER:
###1128 NO, IT DIDN'T. WE KNEW WHAT WE
###1129 HAD TO DO. WE ONLY EXECUTED FOR
###1131 PART OF THE GAME. THEY'RE A
###1132 GREAT TEAM. ALL THE TEAMS IN THE
###1134 LIBERTY LEAGUE ARE SO
###1135 COMPETITIVE THAT ONE DAY YOU
###1136 KNOW YOU CAN BEAT A TEAM FIVE
###1137 NOTHING, THE NEXT DAY YOU CAN
###1139 LOSE, SO IT'S A TOUGH
###1141 CONFERENCE, ONE OF THE TOUGHEST
###1142 IN THE NATION, AND FOR US TO BE
###1146 IN IT IS A REAL PRIVILEGE. HILL:
###1147 HOW DID NOT HAVING YOUR STARTING
###1148 GOALTENDER IN NET AFFECT THE
###1149 TEAM CHEMISTRY? NEW SPEAKER:
###1151 WELL, WE DIDN'T HAVE HIM TUESDAY
###1152 EITHER. THERE'S SOME EFFECT,
###1153 SURE, SEAN WAS ARGUABLY ONE OF
###1155 THE BEST GOALIES IN THE REGION
###1157 ALL YEAR, STRONG PART OF OUR
###1158 SUCCESS, BUT THIS IS A TEAM, WE
###1160 HAVE OTHER PLAYERS TO STEP IN.
###1164 BEN STEPPED IN AND GOT A SHUTOUT
###1166 TUESDAY AGAINST THE 8TH RANKED
###1168 TEAM IN THE COUNTRY. I THOUGHT
###1170 HE DID, YOU KNOW, HE DIDN'T HURT
###1171 US TODAY, BUT SURE, WE MISS, YOU
###1173 MISS A PLAYER OF CONWAY'S
###1175 CALIBER, NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
###1177 HILL: WHY DO YOU THINK YOU GUYS
###1178 MATCHED UP SO WELL TO THE TEAMS
###1179 IN THE LIBERTY LEAGUE AND DID SO
###1180 WELL? NEW SPEAKER: WE'RE A
###1183 SIMPLE TEAM; WE LIKE TO PLAY
###1184 SOCCER, YOU KNOW, BUT A LOT OF
###1186 THE OTHER TEAMS PLAY MORE
###1188 DIRECT, PLAY PHYSICAL, THAT'S
###1189 THE AMERICAN WAY, BUT WE LIKE TO
###1191 PLAY SOCCER AND WE BEAT TEAMS BY
###1193 WEARING THEM OUT WITH OUR
###1194 FITNESS AND THEN IN THE END WE
###1197 BEAT THEM WITH OUR PLAY AND GET
###1198 A FEW GOALS. NEW SPEAKER: I
###1199 THINK WE DID WELL AGAINST IT
###1201 DIDN'T MATTER WHO IT WAS BECAUSE
###1203 WE HAD SOME RELATIVELY TOUGH
###1205 PLAYERS MENTALLY WHO FOUGHT AND
###1208 WE PLAYED A SIMPLE GAME. WE HAD
###1209 A LOT OF CLOSE GAMES, WE GOT A
###1211 LOT OF POSITIVE RESULTS IN CLOSE
###1212 GAMES, SO THAT TELLS YOU A
###1214 LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE MENTAL
###1215 MAKEUP OF SOME OF THE GUYS. WE
###1217 BELIEVED, WE WORKED HARD AND IF
###1219 YOU DO THOSE THINGS SOME GOOD
###1221 THINGS CAN HAPPEN. WE GOT A WAYS
###1222 TO GO, BUT I THINK WE GOT A
###1225 TASTE THIS YEAR, ESPECIALLY FOR
###1227 SOME OF THE YOUNGER GUYS, YOU
###1228 KNOW WE WERE STARTING TWO OR
###1229 THREE FRESHMAN MOST GAMES. TODAY
###1231 WAS ABOUT TODAY AND ABOUT THIS
###1233 YEAR, BUT WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A
###1235 LITTLE BIT OF LOOK AND SAY, YOU
###1237 KNOW, WHAT DOES THIS PRESENT FOR
###1239 US FOR THE FUTURE? HILL: WHAT
###1245 WILL YOU TAKE AWAY FROM THIS
###1246 SEASON AND YOUR TIME HERE
###1248 PLAYING WITH THE TIGERS? NEW
###1250 SPEAKER: JUST THE GREAT MEMORIES
###1252 ON AND OFF THE FIELD, IN THE
###1253 LOCKER ROOM, YOU KNOW, I MET
###1255 SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS THAT
###1257 I'LL KEEP FOR THE REST OF MY
###1259 LIFE AND YOU KNOW, THE MEMORIES
###1260 WHEN I TALK TO MY GRANDKIDS
###1261 ABOUT ME PLAYING COLLEGE SOCCER
