###0 w reheat is when organization is not a poser but was in fact it's run by the
###5 mcmahon's and linda mcmahon
###7 ran for senate
###9 twice
###9 as a republican
###11 so you think they'd be pretty pro quo begin but apparently
###13 in a bone to debate with the tea party or they thought it was a good story line
###17 and uh... they got a new character that was revealed last week
###21 jack's slacker
###23 and he's a tea party guy and his dad
###25 his at manager co real american phys ed boulter
###29 and zeb coulter goes out there and talks about you know
###33 t partylite principles
###35 the nelson said that uh...
###37 by he gets fan mail from rush limbaugh glenn beck and alex jones
###42 outsourcing prop course the realities alex is probably fuming about the
###46 conspiracy and obviously the rock chosen the rockefellers of taken over to the
###49 beat of the all these things are obvious
###52 uh... anyway
###54 mandate
###55 so the conservative fans arm
###58 so melissa closely rates in the deputies making a big mistake with this jack
###62 swagger storyline
###64 and then uh... marks god or rights in amused by this
###70 for are you doing does them culture guy a killer tea party saratoga angle
###75 this a lot of money
###77 military immediately for about a month right
###80 during your guest i sound like they're maker is i'm not like
###83 did they wait but data and
###88 that there is no favorite
###89 i see the w_b_ scrapping all over the tea party right now with the jack
###93 swaggert jimmy not cool law definitely select out teacup
###100 but here's what's my favorite
###101 with their handle sister bolger
###105 defense bloody the idea that they were that's funny
###108 but they're checking pilot does arise that would every where in that direction
###112 you met pads flatness while ago data
###116 liberal that was the bad guy
###118 and think that was funny too
###119 and by the way he's gonna be fighting
###121 jack swagger is alberto del rio
###124 are all heavyweight championship
###127 so the team for a guy
###128 against m_x_ kya
###130 come on house that not fun
###132 the matter with you guys that's fun drama
###134 and you never know team forty guys maybe your guide keep them asking guys as and
###137 then you guys can point out something wrong
###140 the buses dog
###148 so are miss
###149 needlessly reminded us
###151 well john stossel than doctor david initials
###156 these days wrestling inmates that their faith which drives me crazy i don't
###159 think that your government
###162 like storylines what is this uh... soap opera now
###165 all wrestling is the end
###166 in this poor or in print and interest as well as the one out
###170 okay
###171 uh... everybody's lives is a drama new store that's a site map in the old days
###175 we just saw solidity view that doctor david the schultz
###178 uh... irish also still
###180 carrying out a storyline is singled convincing
###184 what you have a good bit her the odds are good that i would be a good one
###188 propelled only without the babbitt's renewing it and apart from the camera
###192 related pretty redneck dot hearing any part of the top didn't
###198 separate like that all you got
###200 so that's what you knew the interview was going south
###204 antoine miller direction and he's rednecks adhered ainit barricaded
###208 sadness
###210 and then what happened next was living there
###213 i think it's a site
###214 today despite cut
###217 dot
###218 uh... what they are hardly at all but
###221 dot holder
###225 bulky six
###229 now that was terribly wrong of course it is thrown out a wrestling and he's
###233 probably
###235 your grocery bags and
###236 thank you have a good day router worry is right
###239 of and dr feel bad for john stossel
###243 and then he had to run away only goof that i wasn't there
###246 and of course just levels are of course it was fake except for that one e crazy
###250 mo moment from those schultz
###252 anil
###254 jericho multiple at at fault to this that we've never shown any interest
###258 before
###258 voice also goes and gets in the bible walters on it
###262 franchise tax had heard that this happened here are not until i start that
###266 i
###267 realized the impact of this i'd hope nobody thinks that this was part of your
###271 story you really weren't because i understand
###275 all right now that it's been difficult or you mostly just to watch it
###279 laptop power to protect their what part of the left and it's just it just makes
###283 me mad armenian orion each year
###285 dr arthur the editor damage but probably permanent lightyears works
###290 uh... winter a lot of fans of the time of both of those buyers people talk live
###294 with her
###295 information p it's not about in
###298 and entertaining and then became very clear and very their own unfortunately
###302 in your case in that part of it to him
###304 happy about it
###309 if it doesn't tell them having trouble hearing which doctor doctor shields
###315 so the recipe just as a huge libertarian guide now at very likely republican
###321 voter so im coarsely wrestles with the republicans are on for a long time now
