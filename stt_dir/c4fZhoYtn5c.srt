2
0:0:0,14 --> 0:0:1,62
STEVE SPANGLER: Well, it's
happening according to plan.


3
0:0:1,62 --> 0:0:3,91
We're launching our big weather
balloon in the middle


4
0:0:3,91 --> 0:0:6,7
of Denver, which is fantastic.


5
0:0:6,7 --> 0:0:10,14
10,000 screaming kids, and the
balloon's ready to go up.


6
0:0:10,14 --> 0:0:11,88
10 minutes.


7
0:0:11,88 --> 0:0:12,51
It's going to be good.


8
0:0:12,51 --> 0:0:16,78



9
0:0:16,78 --> 0:0:19,85
I'm Steve Spangler, and I'm all
about making science fun.


10
0:0:19,85 --> 0:0:22,91
For the last 20 years, I've
been teaching ways to turn


11
0:0:22,91 --> 0:0:25,92
ordinary science experiments
into unforgettable learning


12
0:0:25,92 --> 0:0:26,93
experiences.


13
0:0:26,93 --> 0:0:29,55
I have an amazing team who will
do whatever it takes to


14
0:0:29,55 --> 0:0:32,32
affect the way people
think about science.


15
0:0:32,32 --> 0:0:34,6
And do that, I live
by one motto--


16
0:0:34,6 --> 0:0:43,826
"Make it big, do it right,
give it class."


17
0:0:43,826 --> 0:0:47,2
[MUSIC PLAYING]


18
0:0:47,2 --> 0:0:49,15
STEVE MEER: This is Edge
of Space Sciences.


19
0:0:49,15 --> 0:1:17,394
And today's flight is
flight number 175.


20
0:1:17,394 --> 0:1:20,866
LARRY NOBLE: OK, we have a PVC
nozzle, which has been turned


21
0:1:20,866 --> 0:1:21,85
on a lathe.


22
0:1:21,85 --> 0:1:23,74
It's specially designed.


23
0:1:23,74 --> 0:1:26,9
It fits in the balloon
and neck.


24
0:1:26,9 --> 0:1:29,8
So when this bag starts lifting
off the ground, we


25
0:1:29,8 --> 0:1:33,3
know we have sufficient helium
in the balloon to lift the


26
0:1:33,3 --> 0:1:37,44
entire payload string to
the edge of space.


27
0:1:37,44 --> 0:1:51,33

28
0:1:51,33 --> 0:1:53,18
MALE SPEAKER: Are you ready
to get started?


29
0:1:53,18 --> 0:1:56,12



30
0:1:56,12 --> 0:1:56,77
All right.


31
0:1:56,77 --> 0:1:58,81
Well, we're going to bring him
up right now and introduce to


32
0:1:58,81 --> 0:2:0,81
you Steve Spangler.


33
0:2:0,81 --> 0:2:4,268
[CROWD CHEERING]


34
0:2:4,268 --> 0:2:5,75
STEVE SPANGLER: Welcome,
everybody.


35
0:2:5,75 --> 0:2:9,27
You know, meteorologists have
the coolest tools nowadays.


36
0:2:9,27 --> 0:2:12,3
They've got all this tracking
device and everything else.


37
0:2:12,3 --> 0:2:15,11
But believe it or not, a long
time ago, all they had was a


38
0:2:15,11 --> 0:2:16,51
simple balloon.


39
0:2:16,51 --> 0:2:20,84
So here is what a weather
balloon looks like.


40
0:2:20,84 --> 0:2:22,61
Kids, you want one of these
for your birthday.


41
0:2:22,61 --> 0:2:24,27
Just ask mom and
dad, all right?


42
0:2:24,27 --> 0:2:25,41
[CHEERING]


43
0:2:25,41 --> 0:2:27,65
STEVE SPANGLER: Say, mom and
dad, can I please have a


44
0:2:27,65 --> 0:2:30,91
weather balloon and about
$500 of helium?


45
0:2:30,91 --> 0:2:32,63
It'll be awesome, right?


46
0:2:32,63 --> 0:2:35,38
The mere fact that I just
unrolled this means that they


47
0:2:35,38 --> 0:2:36,84
probably can't launch this.


48
0:2:36,84 --> 0:2:39,71
We'll only use it for teaching
purposes, because that balloon


49
0:2:39,71 --> 0:2:40,87
is so delicate.


50
0:2:40,87 --> 0:2:43,59
I told you early on that we
partnered up with Edge of


51
0:2:43,59 --> 0:2:45,1
Space Science.


52
0:2:45,1 --> 0:2:47,8
Kathy is on the field right now
with our team from Edge of


53
0:2:47,8 --> 0:2:48,84
Space Science.


54
0:2:48,84 --> 0:2:50,91
They're going to tell us a
little bit about the weather


55
0:2:50,91 --> 0:2:53,405
balloon that we got permission
to launch today.


56
0:2:53,405 --> 0:2:54,73
Kathy, tell us all about it.


57
0:2:54,73 --> 0:2:55,93
KATHY SABINE: Hey, Steve.


58
0:2:55,93 --> 0:2:58,81
I've got Steve Meer with
me, and he is with


59
0:2:58,81 --> 0:3:0,69
Edge of Space Science.


60
0:3:0,69 --> 0:3:3,59
And this is a one of a kind
event that you all are going


61
0:3:3,59 --> 0:3:5,43
to be witnessing today,
isn't it?


62
0:3:5,43 --> 0:3:7,23
STEVE MEER: First time we've
ever launched out of a stadium


63
0:3:7,23 --> 0:3:9,21
like this with so many people
watching, so we're very


64
0:3:9,21 --> 0:3:10,2
excited to be here.


65
0:3:10,2 --> 0:3:11,49
KATHY SABINE: Is this
the biggest weather


66
0:3:11,49 --> 0:3:13,8
balloon ever made?


67
0:3:13,8 --> 0:3:14,22
STEVE MEER: No, this is
actually kind of a


68
0:3:14,22 --> 0:3:15,3
small one for us.


69
0:3:15,3 --> 0:3:17,64
This is what we call
1,200 grams.


70
0:3:17,64 --> 0:3:21,44
And it's got about 230 feet of
helium in it when it leaves.


71
0:3:21,44 --> 0:3:24,25
When it gets up to the edge of
space, it'll be about half the


72
0:3:24,25 --> 0:3:25,74
size of a school bus.


73
0:3:25,74 --> 0:3:28,47
KATHY SABINE: My colleagues
are holding pieces of this


74
0:3:28,47 --> 0:3:29,27
weather balloon.


75
0:3:29,27 --> 0:3:31,65
Steve, can you kind of help
me show the kids what


76
0:3:31,65 --> 0:3:32,83
we have behind us?


77
0:3:32,83 --> 0:3:33,25
STEVE MEER: Sure.


78
0:3:33,25 --> 0:3:35,29
So the first thing we
have is a parachute.


79
0:3:35,29 --> 0:3:37,53
And so when the balloon breaks,
it'll all come down


80
0:3:37,53 --> 0:3:38,23
under the parachute.


81
0:3:38,23 --> 0:3:40,21
It's about 5 feet in diameter.


82
0:3:40,21 --> 0:3:42,98
Then we come down to this
payload right here, the green


83
0:3:42,98 --> 0:3:44,0
and orange one.


84
0:3:44,0 --> 0:3:47,4
This is the tracking and
telemetry receiver.


85
0:3:47,4 --> 0:3:49,7
This sends us information about
where the balloon is so


86
0:3:49,7 --> 0:3:50,76
we can find it.


87
0:3:50,76 --> 0:3:53,24
And if we need to abort the
mission for some reason, we


88
0:3:53,24 --> 0:3:55,69
can send it a radio signal,
and it'll cut the balloon


89
0:3:55,69 --> 0:3:57,77
away, and it'll come back
under the parachute.


90
0:3:57,77 --> 0:3:58,99
KATHY SABINE: We've got
Amelia down here.


91
0:3:58,99 --> 0:4:0,1
What's she holding?


92
0:4:0,1 --> 0:4:0,86
STEVE MEER: So Amelia's holding


93
0:4:0,86 --> 0:4:2,48
what we call the batmobile.


94
0:4:2,48 --> 0:4:4,83
The batmobile has two
cameras in it--


95
0:4:4,83 --> 0:4:7,46
one that'll point down and
one that points up.


96
0:4:7,46 --> 0:4:10,37
And then these long rods provide
inertia so it doesn't


97
0:4:10,37 --> 0:4:12,45
spin too much under the thing.


98
0:4:12,45 --> 0:4:14,645
So hopefully on the website
later today, you'll be able to


99
0:4:14,645 --> 0:4:15,81
see some cool video.


100
0:4:15,81 --> 0:4:16,22
KATHY SABINE: All right.


101
0:4:16,22 --> 0:4:18,459
Marty Coniglio's holding
an orange box, Steve.


102
0:4:18,459 --> 0:4:20,26
STEVE MEER: So this orange
box is another camera.


103
0:4:20,26 --> 0:4:22,18
This camera is also
a high-def camera.


104
0:4:22,18 --> 0:4:23,93
And it's going to take video
out to the side.


105
0:4:23,93 --> 0:4:26,1
In fact, it's taping
us as we speak.


106
0:4:26,1 --> 0:4:27,8
And then again, the inertia
rods to keep it


107
0:4:27,8 --> 0:4:29,3
from spinning so much.


108
0:4:29,3 --> 0:4:32,38
So Parker has probably the
most important job here,


109
0:4:32,38 --> 0:4:35,11
because this is the main
tracking and relay beacon.


110
0:4:35,11 --> 0:4:37,21
So this gives us the
latitude and the


111
0:4:37,21 --> 0:4:39,1
longitude and the altitude.


112
0:4:39,1 --> 0:4:41,58
And it also serves as a relay
point for all the trackers on


113
0:4:41,58 --> 0:4:43,92
the ground to talk through, so
we know exactly where the


114
0:4:43,92 --> 0:4:44,84
balloon is at all times.


115
0:4:44,84 --> 0:4:46,39
KATHY SABINE: Now, Steve, I
understand you had to get


116
0:4:46,39 --> 0:4:49,16
special permission, and we have
to get a special window


117
0:4:49,16 --> 0:4:51,6
in sending this balloon
up today.


118
0:4:51,6 --> 0:4:52,59
STEVE MEER: We very much want
to stay out of the way of


119
0:4:52,59 --> 0:4:54,4
everything in the air
that could suck


120
0:4:54,4 --> 0:4:54,79
it into their engines.


121
0:4:54,79 --> 0:4:57,8
So we're on a kind of
a deadline here.


122
0:4:57,8 --> 0:4:57,98
And it's about time.


123
0:4:57,98 --> 0:4:58,29
KATHY SABINE: All right.


124
0:4:58,29 --> 0:4:59,63
I'm going to let you
take over, then.


125
0:4:59,63 --> 0:5:0,29
STEVE MEER: OK, let's go--


126
0:5:0,29 --> 0:5:2,68
STEVE SPANGLER: Hey, Steve,
Kathy, there's two things.


127
0:5:2,68 --> 0:5:5,18
Would you show us the flags
that are on there?


128
0:5:5,18 --> 0:5:7,6
We have a Colorado
Rockies flag.


129
0:5:7,6 --> 0:5:9,69
This is what we're going to
bring back to 9NEWS today,


130
0:5:9,69 --> 0:5:11,96
hopefully for the
4 o'clock show.


131
0:5:11,96 --> 0:5:15,23
Everybody on the weather team
signed that flag, so that


132
0:5:15,23 --> 0:5:17,53
we've got to be able to
get that one back.


133
0:5:17,53 --> 0:5:20,4
And then we put a scientist
on board.


134
0:5:20,4 --> 0:5:22,4
Never before has this scientist
ever gone to the


135
0:5:22,4 --> 0:5:23,44
edge of space.


136
0:5:23,44 --> 0:5:25,76
Ladies and gentlemen, it's
Beaker right there in the


137
0:5:25,76 --> 0:5:26,535
middle of the line.


138
0:5:26,535 --> 0:5:27,31
[CHEERING]


139
0:5:27,31 --> 0:5:29,26
STEVE SPANGLER: And you have to
know that there's tracking


140
0:5:29,26 --> 0:5:30,83
devices on here.


141
0:5:30,83 --> 0:5:33,15
And we're going to learn
something about it right now.


142
0:5:33,15 --> 0:5:36,67
Let me introduce to you the
president of Edge of Space


143
0:5:36,67 --> 0:5:38,17
Sciences organization.


144
0:5:38,17 --> 0:5:39,1
It's Rob Wright.


145
0:5:39,1 --> 0:5:40,852
Nice round of applause
for Rob.


146
0:5:40,852 --> 0:5:42,81
All right, Rob, how do
you know where it's


147
0:5:42,81 --> 0:5:43,58
going to come down?


148
0:5:43,58 --> 0:5:45,44
I mean, what kind of tracking
do you have to let it know


149
0:5:45,44 --> 0:5:46,34
where it's coming down?


150
0:5:46,34 --> 0:5:48,44
ROB WRIGHT: The National Weather
Service compiles a lot


151
0:5:48,44 --> 0:5:51,4
of information about the
upper-level winds.


152
0:5:51,4 --> 0:5:54,28
And what we do is we gather that
information, we base that


153
0:5:54,28 --> 0:5:56,78
information on how fast our
balloon is going up in the


154
0:5:56,78 --> 0:5:58,51
air, and what level
it's going to hit


155
0:5:58,51 --> 0:6:0,5
those directional winds.


156
0:6:0,5 --> 0:6:3,54
And when we graph all that out,
it shows us a nice line


157
0:6:3,54 --> 0:6:5,3
of where it's going to
go direction-wise.


158
0:6:5,3 --> 0:6:5,57
STEVE SPANGLER: All right.


159
0:6:5,57 --> 0:6:6,85
So here we go with
a prediction.


160
0:6:6,85 --> 0:6:7,59
Ready?


161
0:6:7,59 --> 0:6:10,53
You have to do a prediction for
a science hypothesis, but


162
0:6:10,53 --> 0:6:13,13
this guy's on the line with
his organization.


163
0:6:13,13 --> 0:6:15,6
I want you to look right
into that camera.


164
0:6:15,6 --> 0:6:16,94
Tell us where it's going to
come down, because that's


165
0:6:16,94 --> 0:6:19,87
where the chase team from 9NEWS
and the Spangler Effect,


166
0:6:19,87 --> 0:6:20,81
we're all going.


167
0:6:20,81 --> 0:6:21,72
ROB WRIGHT: Hm, thank.


168
0:6:21,72 --> 0:6:21,92
All right.


169
0:6:21,92 --> 0:6:22,47
STEVE SPANGLER: All right,
look right into the


170
0:6:22,47 --> 0:6:23,6
camera and tell them.


171
0:6:23,6 --> 0:6:25,68
ROB WRIGHT: We're going to land
just north of Wiggins, I


172
0:6:25,68 --> 0:6:27,37
say about 10 miles.


173
0:6:27,37 --> 0:6:27,98
STEVE SPANGLER: Wow.


174
0:6:27,98 --> 0:6:28,35
All right?


175
0:6:28,35 --> 0:6:30,44
So 10 miles north of Wiggins.


176
0:6:30,44 --> 0:6:33,43
We've got a track team that's
starting their way there so


177
0:6:33,43 --> 0:6:34,99
that they can see this
all the way through.


178
0:6:34,99 --> 0:6:36,91
Nice round of applause
for Rob, would ya?


179
0:6:36,91 --> 0:6:38,16
From Edge of Space Science.


180
0:6:38,16 --> 0:6:41,75



181
0:6:41,75 --> 0:6:42,93
Here's what had to happen.


182
0:6:42,93 --> 0:6:46,56
In all seriousness, you don't
normally launch from the


183
0:6:46,56 --> 0:6:47,81
middle of Denver.


184
0:6:47,81 --> 0:6:51,19
The FAA has given us permission
for this window of


185
0:6:51,19 --> 0:6:52,18
opportunity.


186
0:6:52,18 --> 0:6:56,45
It means that air traffic right
now for jets has been


187
0:6:56,45 --> 0:6:59,54
diverted around Denver for the
next 10 minutes so that you


188
0:6:59,54 --> 0:7:0,66
can see a launch.


189
0:7:0,66 --> 0:7:2,7
I think that's pretty cool.


190
0:7:2,7 --> 0:7:4,91
So say thanks to the Edge
of Space Science people.

0:7:7,97 --> 0:7:9,81
STEVE SPANGLER: Kathy and
Steve, are you ready?


193
0:7:9,81 --> 0:7:10,203
STEVE MEER: OK.


194
0:7:10,203 --> 0:7:10,99
We're good.


195
0:7:10,99 --> 0:7:12,93
STEVE SPANGLER: We're going
to a countdown from 10.


196
0:7:12,93 --> 0:7:13,72
Are you ready?


197
0:7:13,72 --> 0:7:14,37
Here we go.


198
0:7:14,37 --> 0:7:24,583
10 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4,
3, 2, 1, let go!


199
0:7:24,583 --> 0:7:26,31
Here it goes.

0:7:26,31 --> 0:7:27,115
Here it goes.


201
0:7:27,115 --> 0:7:28,6
Here it goes.


202

There's Beaker.


203
0:7:29,59 --> 0:7:30,58
I love it.


204
0:7:30,58 --> 0:7:33,55
Look at him go.


205
0:7:33,55 --> 0:7:33,55
Wow.


206
0:7:33,55 --> 0:9:26,114
[MUSIC PLAYING]


207
0:9:26,114 --> 0:10:57,248



208
0:10:57,248 --> 0:10:59,738
SPEAKER: 93,715.


209
0:10:59,738 --> 0:11:2,726
93,715 was max.


210
0:11:2,726 --> 0:11:4,33
[INAUDIBLE].


211
0:11:4,33 --> 0:11:6,11
ROB WRIGHT: Made it
up to 93,000 feet.


212
0:11:6,11 --> 0:11:14,29
It's currently at 92,800 feet.


213
0:11:14,29 --> 0:11:15,433
STEVE SPANGLER: I think
you can call off


214
0:11:15,433 --> 0:11:16,25
the tracking team.


215
0:11:16,25 --> 0:11:17,72
I think we see it in the sky.


216
0:11:17,72 --> 0:11:19,68
So we'll just head
towards that.


217
0:11:19,68 --> 0:11:20,17
SPEAKER: Oh, OK.


218
0:11:20,17 --> 0:11:21,42
You're all good.


219
0:11:21,42 --> 0:11:26,5



220
0:11:26,5 --> 0:11:27,51
STEVE SPANGLER: See these
guys over here?


221
0:11:27,51 --> 0:11:29,9
These are the mart guys.


222
0:11:29,9 --> 0:11:31,27
We've just got a car
and a [INAUDIBLE].


223
0:11:31,27 --> 0:11:32,59
That's all we have.


224
0:11:32,59 --> 0:11:34,8
And some gummy bears
and some chips.


225
0:11:34,8 --> 0:11:40,87



226
0:11:40,87 --> 0:11:41,34
All right.


227
0:11:41,34 --> 0:11:42,52
We're here.


228
0:11:42,52 --> 0:11:43,58
I don't know where we are.


229
0:11:43,58 --> 0:11:45,58
All I know is there's a whole
bunch of people, and it's


230
0:11:45,58 --> 0:11:48,1
supposed to be in that
field somewhere.


231
0:11:48,1 --> 0:11:50,19
And I understand the farmer's
not going to shoot us.


232
0:11:50,19 --> 0:11:52,27
So we can climb over
the fence.


233
0:11:52,27 --> 0:11:53,98
We're going to go find
the payload.


234
0:11:53,98 --> 0:11:55,77
Beep, beep, beep, beep,
beep, beep.


235
0:11:55,77 --> 0:12:3,12



236
0:12:3,12 --> 0:12:5,285
All right, so what
does this do?


237
0:12:5,285 --> 0:12:6,6
DOUG: This is a directional
antenna.


238
0:12:6,6 --> 0:12:7,46
STEVE SPANGLER: OK.


239
0:12:7,46 --> 0:12:7,89
DOUG: OK.


240
0:12:7,89 --> 0:12:10,19
And so what it does is it
receives the signal really


241
0:12:10,19 --> 0:12:12,3
well here and not
very well there.


242
0:12:12,3 --> 0:12:13,18
So you can hear it, right?


243
0:12:13,18 --> 0:12:13,54
STEVE SPANGLER: Right.


244
0:12:13,54 --> 0:12:16,465
DOUG: So when it's pointed at
the payload, now I know which


245
0:12:16,465 --> 0:12:17,11
way I'm walking.


246
0:12:17,11 --> 0:12:19,34
If I point it over here, I'm
not walking that way.


247
0:12:19,34 --> 0:12:22,678
STEVE SPANGLER: Oh,
how cool is that?


248
0:12:22,678 --> 0:12:23,928
There it is.


249
0:12:23,928 --> 0:12:32,125



250
0:12:32,125 --> 0:12:32,62
Look at this.


251
0:12:32,62 --> 0:12:34,2
It's from the end of the
Spangler Effect.


252
0:12:34,2 --> 0:12:35,465
We have nothing.


253
0:12:35,465 --> 0:12:37,3
No Spangler Effect anymore.


254
0:12:37,3 --> 0:12:40,46



255
0:12:40,46 --> 0:12:41,635
This is our flag.


256
0:12:41,635 --> 0:12:43,73
S-- that's as much
as we have left.


257
0:12:43,73 --> 0:12:46,29
While the logos may not have
lasted, look at this--


258
0:12:46,29 --> 0:12:48,1
Beaker made the flight.


259
0:12:48,1 --> 0:12:49,69
And he actually looks good.


260
0:12:49,69 --> 0:12:52,2
Doesn't look like there's
any problem at all.


261
0:12:52,2 --> 0:12:53,76
He made the flight.


262
0:12:53,76 --> 0:12:58,35
Popped at 93,000 feet, and
he's back down again.


263
0:12:58,35 --> 0:12:58,85
Edge of space--


264
0:12:58,85 --> 0:13:1,56
I can hardly wait to see the
video of him just flopping


265
0:13:1,56 --> 0:13:3,578
around up here like this.


266
0:13:3,578 --> 0:13:4,88
This is really cool.


267
0:13:4,88 --> 0:13:7,41
At 11 o'clock today,
we launched this


268
0:13:7,41 --> 0:13:8,4
massive weather balloon.


269
0:13:8,4 --> 0:13:9,61
We had a wonderful payload.


270
0:13:9,61 --> 0:13:11,68
And here we are at
about 3 o'clock.


271
0:13:11,68 --> 0:13:14,94
We finally have tracked it
15 miles north of Snyder.


272
0:13:14,94 --> 0:13:16,71
The payload's intact.


273
0:13:16,71 --> 0:13:18,74
Looks like we have our GoPro
cameras that will


274
0:13:18,74 --> 0:13:20,0
grab all of our video.


275
0:13:20,0 --> 0:13:21,35
Of course, the scientist
is here.


276
0:13:21,35 --> 0:13:22,87
Beaker made it back.


277
0:13:22,87 --> 0:13:24,48
I have no idea what
this guy saw.


278
0:13:24,48 --> 0:13:28,68
And our flag from 9NEWS all
signed has come back as well.


279
0:13:28,68 --> 0:13:29,43
Success--


280
0:13:29,43 --> 0:13:31,96
this is the whole process,
the scientific process.


281
0:13:31,96 --> 0:13:34,3
And it takes a team of really,
really smart people to teach


282
0:13:34,3 --> 0:13:35,58
us how to do this.


283
0:13:35,58 --> 0:13:37,416
I just want to get kids
excited about science.


284
0:13:37,416 --> 0:13:38,83
It's fun.


285
0:13:38,83 --> 0:13:40,84
