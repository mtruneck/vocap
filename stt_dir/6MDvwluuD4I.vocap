###57 Welcome back to Mississippi Roads.
###59 I'm your host Walt Grayson.
###61 This week we've traveled up to Clarksdale
###64 for the 25th annual Sunflower River Blues & Gospel Festival.
###76 ♪♪
###81 It was always on the map, it's just being on the map itself,
###85 Clarksdale did not realize how much it was on the map.
###92 Bill and I sort of helped along in that sense.
###96 People were coming here from everywhere
###98 to hear blues and you couldn't guarantee it.
###105 So we made it so you could guarantee it.
###108 They are still coming from everywhere,
###110 but now they stay.
###114 If you stick around long enough,
###116 people hear about you.
###118 They will come.
###119 We say build it, they'll come.
###121 Grayson: And that's exactly what people
###122 from all over the world are doing:
###124 Traveling to Clarksdale, Mississippi
###125 for the 25th annual Sunflower Blues Festival.
###128 Freeman: I'm feeling pretty good
###130 about how it is now and where it's basing itself
###133 after only been involved with it for the last,
###135 what, 15 years?
###139 But look outside.
###140 We're smoking along.
###155 Grayson: While Clarksdale has always been
###157 a popular destination for European travelers
###159 looking to trace the Blues Trail,
###161 The Sunflower Blues Festival offers three days
###163 of Blues and Gospel music that
###165 generations of family members can all enjoy.
###168 During the 2012 festival, Robert Plant,
###170 former front man for Led Zeppelin showed up
###172 to give Clarksdale his perspective on The Blues.
###174 Plant: The only reason to come to America
###176 is to come here, really.
###178 Clarksdale is a sort of condition
###183 I've had since I was a kid.
###186 I was so moved by the music when I had
###191 no knowledge of the social structure of this state
###197 or even the kind of racial interplay,
###205 if you want to call it that.
###206 I had no idea when I was a kid.
###209 I just heard the music and I think
###211 like so many kids around the world,
###214 no matter what language you speak,
###215 it's very evocative and infectious and alluring.
###223 But once you're drawn to the sound of the music
###225 and the scales, then you start learning more and more
###228 about the story behind it all.
###237 I was 13 when I first heard,
###240 I suppose, black music generally.
###243 I guess it was Sonny Boy Rice Miller
###247 and he was playing and he became
###249 quite a celebrity in England when I was in school.
###252 So I picked up the harmonica.
###254 I loved the way that he played and swung.
###258 He was a real star in the UK.
###262 Grayson: And with the popularity
###263 of Mississippi Delta Blues in Britain
###264 came the British Invasion with all of their roots
###267 stemming from right here in Mississippi.
###270 Freeman: It's important because
###272 this is like the Nativity.
###275 This is where American music actually gets its base.
###281 All of American music, somehow you can trace it
###285 all the way back down here to Blues and Gospel
###290 right here in the Delta.
###299 Plant: I see my own mortality in a different light
###302 now to when I was a kid and I know that when I
###305 was a kid, I did see a lot of the people who are now
###310 heralded in this room who were real space shifters.
###317 And I come back here because I connect.
###324 There's a lot of unfinished business down here.
###327 I don't know what it is even,
###328 I just know that and sometimes I feel
###333 very evocative moments where I can feel history
###338 and I can feel... I don't know.
###344 And on that note,
###346 I must wish you all a very good night.
###348 (Applause)
###360 Grayson: Clarksdale is located in Coahoma County
###362 in the heart of the Mississippi Delta
###364 and home to the Blues.
###366 We are at one of Clarksdale's most famous
###368 or maybe should I say one of Clarksdale's
###370 most infamous blues landmarks:
###373 the intersection of Highways 61 and 49.
###376 The notorious crossroads where,
###378 local legend has it that world-renown blues
###380 guitarist Robert Johnson sold his soul to the devil.
###384 Or was that blues guitarist Tommy Johnson?
###387 No, that was in Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?
###390 Anyway, in our first story we're going
###392 to visit a Clarksdale landmark
###393 with a reputation a little less sinister.
###398 1930's Radio Announcer: We interrupt this broadcast
###400 to bring you this breaking news:
###401 Jazz and Blues legend, Bessie Smith,
###403 has been pronounced dead in Clarksdale, Mississippi.
###404 Details are not known at this time.
###406 Please stay tuned for more information.
###408 Now, in memory, Bessie Smith's,
###410 "'Taint Nobody's Business If I Do."
###417 Bessie Smith was known- or is known-
###420 as the empress of the blues.
###423 She was making records and people were buying them.
###428 In late September 1937, late at night
###433 coming from Memphis to Clarksdale,
###435 Bessie and her driver were coming down old 61.
###439 (tires squealing)
###444 She was brought by ambulance to Clarksdale's
###447 G.T. Thomas Hospital, but it was too late by then.
###459 Man: It is the most blues-historic place
###461 in the world that you can stay.
###463 It's got the rich history of pre-hotel,
###466 which when it was the G.T. Thomas
###468 Afro-American hospital,
###469 Bessie Smith, the great blues singer
###471 from the 1920s died there in 1937.
###474 Then in 1944 Frank Ratliff's mother started
###477 the Riverside Hotel and it has been continuously
###479 operating ever since then.
###481 This place was built in 1920-something.
###486 These doors are the originals.
###489 August 10th, 1944 that's when my mother
###493 brought me through these doors
###495 when she opened this business up.
###498 She's one of the best-known ladies
###501 that's ever been in these parts.
###503 She's seen the hardship and her being a black woman,
###506 or a woman period, she withstood the test of time
###510 because she kept business going on even in the old days
###514 and stuff when things were really tight.
###516 You have to consider where we are
###518 and what that time was like.
###520 Here's a lady that had multiple businesses,
###523 had great store credit.
###524 She was a seamstress, she had a café,
###526 she had a hotel.
###527 It was a lady who was obviously very together
###530 and a very strong and intelligent woman.
###534 When mother looked at this place there were only 8 rooms.
###538 From this wall to the back,
###541 that's what mother had added.
###547 I don't buy furniture.
###548 I got furniture in here over a hundred years old.
###552 That furniture there: 1944.
###561 You look around at all these pictures,
###563 these people have stayed here, lived here.
###567 Some of them lived here.
###570 Room nine: Ike Turner.
###572 He lived here for about four
###574 or five years before he left.
###578 "Rocket 88," Ike Turner.
###580 It was written by Jackie Brenston,
###583 the music and everything was put together
###585 in the basement.
###586 They went to Memphis and recorded it.
###592 Everybody that stayed here called mom, "Mom."
###595 John Lee Hooker, Sam Cooke,
###599 Muddy Waters lived here.
###601 Stolle: When he tells you you're staying
###602 in the Muddy Waters room or the Pop Staples room
###605 or the John Lee Hooker room or whatever,
###607 they stayed there.
###608 So the music history is just incredibly rich.
###611 You're staying right where it happened,
###613 where the guys that made the music stayed.
###616 They played with me when I was small,
###618 when I was 4, 5, and 6 years old.
###621 They lived here and after they'd come from a gig,
###625 from playing, they'd go back there
###627 and get me out of my bed.
###629 You're staying here because of its history
###632 in a lot of ways but part of the history
###635 happens to be the living guy
###638 that owns and runs the place.
###641 My impression of the place is
###643 it's a very unassuming place.
###645 Appearances aren't that important.
###646 It's one of the most unpretentious places
###648 I've ever been to.
###649 Came in and fell in love with it
###651 immediately, learned about all the people
###653 who had stayed here.
###654 I think we're in Sam Cooke's room.
###656 It's all really cool stuff.
###659 And then Rat, the owner, is quality.
###661 He's a really good guy.
###663 Stolle: Rat is actually connected to the history.
###666 He's not a tour guide that's sort of studied
###669 the patter and gives it out.
###671 He's not an MA history student just telling you
###673 what he'd learned.
###675 He's actually lived the experience.
###681 Ritter: Rat and the Riverside are pillars
###683 of Clarksdale and the historical community.
###688 Clarksdale isn't like a museum piece,
###690 it's not this thing that's just sunk in formaldehyde.
###693 It's still a living city.
###696 Everyone's very friendly.
###697 We've been hanging out in bars and restaurants
###699 and everyone's very hospitable.
###702 One of the really awesome things for guests who stay
###704 at the Riverside Hotel, is that not only are you
###707 welcomed when you check in;
###708 you might get a tour if you've never been there
###710 and some conversation and history.
###712 But also he'll come down and check on you.
###714 If you go to Red's Lounge,
###715 he'll come and check on you.
###717 Not because he thinks something will happen
###719 but because he wants you to feel at home.
###722 Try to get that out of a five-star hotel.
###726 Riverside Hotel: home away from home.
###732 See I'm just a caretaker.
###734 The people that come here, they are the owners.
###739 And I tell them: if you rent from me,
###742 then you just bought stock in the Riverside.
###752 Not only is Mississippi the birthplace of the Blues,
###755 but County Music, Rock and Roll and a lot
###757 of other forms of popular music can trace
###759 their roots back to the Magnolia State.
###762 Maybe that's one of the reasons why
###764 so many nationally renowned artists
###766 have once called Mississippi home.
###787 I'm sitting on the third row I can't help
###790 but tell the person next to me,
###795 "You see the guy on the right?
###797 He's my boy!"
###808 That's when it dawned on me
###810 that I think I'm the father of a rock star.
###812 I'm not sure.
###814 It's like a storybook.
###816 Some people can't believe your boy
###818 is playing with Wilco.
###829 Pat's just one of the most natural musicians
###833 I've ever met.
###835 I've always been involved with music from day one.
###840 My family is very musical.
###842 Pat's grandmother was a great musician, too.
###844 She played piano.
###846 And my grandmother was a great musician.
###847 She played piano, too.
###849 They were sisters.
###850 So we kind of grew up in that whole environment
###852 of living around a house or going
###854 to a house on Sundays or holidays
###856 where there was a lot of music going on.
###858 That's the environment that we grew up in.
###860 My dad grew up in a very musically active family.
###867 They were always doing shows around the house
###872 and for people in the neighborhood.
###874 Show business was kind of always part
###877 of their mode of being.
###882 So he was getting music
###884 from both sides pretty much all the time.
###910 The fact that my dad, Tony Sansone,
###915 was involved with a festival called
###917 the Lively Arts Festival.
###919 He booked acts in Meridian
###921 at the Temple Theatre
###922 all through the 1970's and 1980's.
###926 He was responsible for bringing
###928 a lot of legendary acts to Meridian.
###934 We had some great shows here.
###937 My boy spent a lot of time on the stage.
###940 That was his growing up time.
###942 He would come down here with me
###944 and do sound checks.
###946 He got to see Ray Charles and Tony Bennett.
###950 Gladys Knight and the Commodores
###954 and lots of great country acts.
###957 All these famous people on the stage,
###961 he can kind of relate to that even as a kid.
###964 Meridian is a very musical city.
###982 He graduated down there and he was staying
###984 down in Hattiesburg and worked at a T-shirt place.
###989 When I left Hattiesburg and moved
###991 to New Orleans in the mid-1990's, John had moved
###994 from Oxford to New Orleans as well.
###998 So both ended up in New Orleans at the same time.
###1000 We had really similar tastes in terms of music
###1003 that we bonded over favorite records.
###1009 So I started bouncing songs off of him.
###1012 We recorded the first Autumn Defense record
###1015 at King's Way in New Orleans, a really great studio.
###1036 Through that connection and through our band,
###1040 that's how I got to know Jeff and Glenn and the Wilco guys.
###1046 Everyone knew him and that was
###1048 sort of the way with Wilco.
###1050 It was always not about auditions.
###1053 It was more about who was in the area
###1057 and just friends.
###1060 That's the way it has always been with the band.
###1062 Jeff knew that Nells Kline would be a good fit
###1066 and try to make a super band or something
###1068 to have Pat involved and they both really raised
###1073 the level of musicianship in the band.
###1085 He and Jeff have had this wonderful sort of rapport
###1090 where Jeff has more of a vision,
###1094 more of a big picture guy and Pat is more
###1097 of a small detail-oriented guy in the studio.
###1100 He has sort of been with Jeff almost a musical director
###1106 at different times with the band.
###1109 Pat: It happened very organically.
###1111 It wasn't really set out that I was going to be the coproducer
###1117 of the record when we started the record.
###1120 We started making the record in our own studio
###1122 in Chicago without an outside producer.
###1125 There just came a point in the process where there
###1131 needed to be someone filling the hole that was there
###1137 because we didn't have an outside producer.
###1140 I think Jeff trusted me in that situation enough to allow
###1145 me to fill that role with this record.
###1160 They are different animals,
###1162 the studio and the stage.
###1163 I love to perform.
###1166 Just the feeling that you get in that conversation
###1171 between yourself and the audience
###1173 and the guys that you are playing with.
###1175 It can be a really thrilling feeling
###1179 when it's going well.
###1181 There is no other place that you can get that.
###1190 We tried to do a show that's satisfying
###1194 to the crowd and satisfying to us.
###1197 There is a big catalog.
###1198 The Wilco catalog is pretty big at this point.
###1201 There is a lot of music to draw upon.
###1212 I think of The Temple as sort of a sacred place to me.
###1216 That was the place where my dad put on
###1218 all of those shows in the 1970's.
###1220 We said, "Let's see if we can get Wilco."
###1222 So I called the office.
###1224 I told him if you want to book Wilco at The Temple
###1228 like you always have, good luck.
###1233 He went through the same process
###1236 that anybody would to book Wilco.
###1239 He still makes fun of me about that,
###1241 but that's okay.
###1243 We were only going to do one show,
###1244 so we didn't have any computer
###1246 or credit cards set up.
###1248 We didn't have anything.
###1249 I said you are going to be getting people
###1251 from all over the South, maybe all over the country.
###1254 There are going to be people from all over
###1257 that are going to be coming to the show.
###1259 Have you got your credit card--
###1262 do you have an online thing happening
###1265 for ticket buyers or credit cards?
###1266 He said oh no.
###1268 We're probably not going to do any credit cards.
###1270 I said you have to have a credit card set up.
###1278 How are you going to sell tickets
###1280 to people all over the country?
###1281 He said we'll probably just do like we always did.
###1284 They can send me a self-addressed
###1286 stamped envelope and the money for the tickets
###1291 and we will send their tickets back.
###1294 I said that is never going to work.
###1296 You just can't do it.
###1298 We couldn't send them to the wrong place
###1300 because they addressed the envelope.
###1303 We sold this theater out in three or four days.
###1307 Every single person that sat in that theater,
###1311 he had talked to on the phone
###1312 and helped them pick out their seats.
###1315 I think that's the way that Tony had always produced
###1317 and done shows and it still worked for him
###1321 with the Wilco show.
###1322 And then the next thing I know,
###1324 we are booked at The Temple Theater.
###1344 It's a very rare and unique opportunity
###1348 to be able to play with five other guys
###1352 that get along so well and also are
###1356 able to connect so deeply musically.
###1360 I feel very lucky to be able to do this
###1363 with these guys.
###1365 I think he is a goodwill ambassador for our state.
###1368 We've had a lot of other musicians
###1369 that were goodwill ambassadors, too.
###1371 Chris Etheridge who just left us
###1373 was a goodwill ambassador for our state.
###1375 I think Pat is kind of filling those shoes now.
###1379 I'm about as proud as a dad can be of a son who's
###1383 done real well and he's a nice person.
###1387 Patrick is a nice person
###1392 who happens to be a great musician.
###1404 (Applause)
###1413 Regrettably, that's all the time we have for this episode.
###1415 But if you'd like any information about anything
###1417 you've seen on tonight's show,

###1423 Until next time, I'm Walt Grayson.
###1424 I'll be seeing you on Mississippi Roads.
###1431 We close tonight with a song written by Graham Parsons
###1434 and Meridian's own Chris Etheridge.
###1436 We lost the legendary Chris Etheridge a few months ago.
