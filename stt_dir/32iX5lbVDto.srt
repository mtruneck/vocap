IVAR BERGLIN: Gorgoroth may
not be the most celebrated


5
0:1:14,56 --> 0:1:17,33
band to rise out of the infamous
Norwegian black metal


6
0:1:17,33 --> 0:1:20,45
scene, but they are by far the
most feared and controversial.


7
0:1:20,45 --> 0:1:23,41
With their abrasive sound,
chaotic live shows, and


8
0:1:23,41 --> 0:1:26,18
well-publicized criminal
convictions, Gorgoroth have


9
0:1:26,18 --> 0:1:28,98
spread their message of fear
and hate across the world.


10
0:1:28,98 --> 0:1:31,53
At the center of the storm
of controversy is Gaahl,


11
0:1:31,53 --> 0:1:34,9
Gorgoroth lead vocalist
and arguably the most


12
0:1:34,9 --> 0:1:35,65
despised man in Norway.


13
0:1:35,65 --> 0:1:39,535
In 2005, Gaahl was charged with
torture-like violence and


14
0:1:39,535 --> 0:1:40,91
served nine months in prison.


15
0:1:40,91 --> 0:1:43,65
His second incarceration
for violent acts.


16
0:1:43,65 --> 0:1:46,25
The court claims he tortured his
victim for six hours while


17
0:1:46,25 --> 0:1:48,58
collecting his blood into
a cup and threatened to


18
0:1:48,58 --> 0:1:49,62
make him drink it.


19
0:1:49,62 --> 0:1:52,89
In January of 2007, when he
was ready for release,


20
0:1:52,89 --> 0:1:55,77
photographer Peter Beste took
us to Gaahl's hometown in


21
0:1:55,77 --> 0:1:59,25
Norway to get to know the guy
Terrorizer magazine calls the


22
0:1:59,25 --> 0:2:1,24
most evil man alive.


23
0:2:1,24 --> 0:2:3,436
I'm Ivar Berglin, welcome
to Norway.


24
0:2:3,436 --> 0:2:25,59



25
0:2:25,59 --> 0:2:28,35
But the story of Gaahl and
Norwegian black metal actually


26
0:2:28,35 --> 0:2:32,6
starts in Newcastle, England
back in 1979, when a local


27
0:2:32,6 --> 0:2:34,52
metal band named Venom,
responding to the rampant


28
0:2:34,52 --> 0:2:37,48
commercialism of heavy metal,
decided to take their music in


29
0:2:37,48 --> 0:2:40,1
a darker, more extreme direction
through satanic


30
0:2:40,1 --> 0:2:41,41
lyrics and imagery.


31
0:2:41,41 --> 0:2:44,4
This spawned black metal, a
term coined by their 1982


32
0:2:44,4 --> 0:2:45,66
album of the same name.


33
0:2:45,66 --> 0:2:48,17
From there, the door opened for
bands with similar ideas


34
0:2:48,17 --> 0:2:48,98
and sounds.


35
0:2:48,98 --> 0:2:52,12
Bands like Mercyful Fate from
Denmark, Hellhammer from


36
0:2:52,12 --> 0:2:55,47
Switzerland, and Bathory
from Sweden.


37
0:2:55,47 --> 0:2:58,2
At the end of the '80s, a second
wave of black metal


38
0:2:58,2 --> 0:2:59,12
surfaced in Norway.


39
0:2:59,12 --> 0:3:2,63
Bands like Dark Throne, Emperor,
Immortal, and Mayhem


40
0:3:2,63 --> 0:3:5,2
perfected the black metal sound,
taking the music's


41
0:3:5,2 --> 0:3:9,59
lyrics and stage imagery to
even darker extremes.


42
0:3:9,59 --> 0:3:11,5
KING: We chose a
different path.


43
0:3:11,5 --> 0:3:17,29
It was getting the music not
as fast but atmospheric.


44
0:3:17,29 --> 0:3:21,15
It was also not as
well-produced.


45
0:3:21,15 --> 0:3:24,77
It was more about the atmosphere
the music created.


46
0:3:24,77 --> 0:3:29,52
And also the fact that we
chose to have a satanic


47
0:3:29,52 --> 0:3:32,63
approach towards the lyrics
and also combining those


48
0:3:32,63 --> 0:3:35,53
things to be an art form
called black metal.


49
0:3:35,53 --> 0:3:38,49
PYTTEN: Euronymous called me,
and I started working with him


50
0:3:38,49 --> 0:3:45,36
together with Varg Vikernes
until '94, when all this stuff


51
0:3:45,36 --> 0:3:46,61
started happening to churches.

IVAR BERGLIN: In the mid '90s,
a series of crimes in Norway


54
0:3:52,81 --> 0:3:54,52
brought black metal to
the attention of


55
0:3:54,52 --> 0:3:55,72
the mainstream media.


56
0:3:55,72 --> 0:3:58,36
The arson of over a dozen
Christian churches and the


57
0:3:58,36 --> 0:4:1,48
murder of Mayhem guitarist
Euronymous by band-mate Varg


58
0:4:1,48 --> 0:4:4,6
Vikernes, who stabbed
him 23 times in the


59
0:4:4,6 --> 0:4:6,39
face, neck, and back.


60
0:4:6,39 --> 0:4:9,91
LARS NEDLIN: When it comes to
the media coverage of the


61
0:4:9,91 --> 0:4:15,76
black metal in Norway,
it all started with


62
0:4:15,76 --> 0:4:16,93
the criminal cases.


63
0:4:16,93 --> 0:4:19,209
I mean, it didn't start with the
music when it comes to the


64
0:4:19,209 --> 0:4:20,36
tabloid in Norway.


65
0:4:20,36 --> 0:4:26,77
It started with the church
burnings, with the murders and


66
0:4:26,77 --> 0:4:31,805
everything surrounding that
era with Burzum and Varg


67
0:4:31,805 --> 0:4:35,99
Vikernes and, well, good tabloid
stories basically.


68

EINAR ENGELSTAD: I couldn't
believe that


69
0:4:37,51 --> 0:4:38,74
they were that foolish.


70
0:4:38,74 --> 0:4:46,75
On the other hand, they had an
identity because everybody was


71
0:4:46,75 --> 0:4:48,16
against them.

in a lot of funny things.

75
0:5:16,63 --> 0:5:18,41
LARS NEDLIN: Then there's
the music.


76
0:5:18,41 --> 0:5:21,1
And I think most of the
bands today are


77
0:5:21,1 --> 0:5:22,5
centered around the music.


78
0:5:22,5 --> 0:5:25,6
But of course you have bands
like Gorgoroth who have the


79
0:5:25,6 --> 0:5:28,34
ideology still very much
intact within the band.


80
0:5:28,34 --> 0:5:29,59
There's a satanic ideology.

84
0:5:50,11 --> 0:5:59,244

of them should be erased.

ever seen a live gig,


94
0:6:52,12 --> 0:6:54,4
you'd definitely understand.


95
0:6:54,4 --> 0:6:56,51
They're all extreme in the
way that they look.

KVITRAFN: The whole makeup and
spikes and flames and all of


98
0:7:4,4 --> 0:7:8,4
that is about putting faces
to the music, really.


99
0:7:8,4 --> 0:7:11,8
And enhancing the things we
are trying to express.


100
0:7:11,8 --> 0:7:15,48

to an audience, it's a


101
0:7:15,48 --> 0:7:18,64
message that's important,
it's not the music.


102

to the our main agenda,

Satan, or satanism himself.

spreading fear.

create a change and

0:7:50,76 --> 0:7:55,7
also get our ideas across.

of things to the media in a


124
0:8:24,84 --> 0:8:28,66
way that makes it
highly usable.


125
0:8:28,66 --> 0:8:32,539

or bands around


126
0:8:32,539 --> 0:8:36,48

IVAR BERGLIN: On February 1,
2004, Gorgoroth appalled the


138
0:9:7,59 --> 0:9:10,48
Catholic nation of Poland with
a blasphemous display of


139
0:9:10,48 --> 0:9:13,82
satanic imagery at their most
controversial show to date.


140
0:9:13,82 --> 0:9:18,29
KING: We had a lot of sheep
skulls, as well as a lot of


141
0:9:18,29 --> 0:9:22,39
sheep heads on poles all over
the front of the stage and


142
0:9:22,39 --> 0:9:23,94
four crosses.


143
0:9:23,94 --> 0:9:28,7
Up on the crosses were two naked
men, hooded, and two


144
0:9:28,7 --> 0:9:29,9
naked hooded women.


145
0:9:29,9 --> 0:9:29,91
Covered in blood.


146
0:9:29,91 --> 0:9:33,13
The sheep represents the flock,
and we represent the


147
0:9:33,13 --> 0:9:37,58
goat, the individual striving
to go our own ways, not


148
0:9:37,58 --> 0:9:40,5
necessarily following
the flock.


149
0:9:40,5 --> 0:9:42,88
GAAHL: The flock and the sheep,
it's the Christian


150
0:9:42,88 --> 0:9:47,36
themselves that's chosen this
word from the Bible.


151
0:9:47,36 --> 0:9:49,73
You have the goat, and
you have the sheep.


152
0:9:49,73 --> 0:9:52,7
The sheep is the one that
belongs to God, and the goat


153
0:9:52,7 --> 0:9:54,37
is the one that will
be punished because


154
0:9:54,37 --> 0:9:56,97
they have a free will.


155
0:9:56,97 --> 0:9:58,81
IVAR BERGLIN: To get a better
understanding of Gaahl and


156
0:9:58,81 --> 0:10:1,65
where he comes from, we
travelled across Norway to the


157
0:10:1,65 --> 0:10:3,8
small mountain village
where he was born


158
0:10:3,8 --> 0:10:5,5
and still lives today.

rumors about Gorgoroth and


161
0:10:11,88 --> 0:10:15,3
always a lot of rumors
about Gaahl.


162
0:10:15,3 --> 0:10:16,95
And--


163
0:10:16,95 --> 0:10:18,57
IVAR BERGLIN: Are they true?


164
0:10:18,57 --> 0:10:22,696
KVITRAFN: Well, no, of c--


165
0:10:22,696 --> 0:10:24,19
well, maybe some.


166
0:10:24,19 --> 0:11:59,63



167
0:11:59,63 --> 0:12:2,12
IVAR BERGLIN: I'm standing
outside of Gaahl's house.


168
0:12:2,12 --> 0:12:4,47
Everything you see around us is
owned by his family and has


169
0:12:4,47 --> 0:12:6,49
been so for generations.


170
0:12:6,49 --> 0:12:8,71
We're the first ever journalists
to be here.


171
0:12:8,71 --> 0:12:12,46
And I'm quite honored but
actually feeling quite scared.


172
0:12:12,46 --> 0:12:22,35



173
0:12:22,35 --> 0:12:23,457
PETER BESTE: This town, I
guess we could call it a


174
0:12:23,457 --> 0:12:24,93
valley, is named after
his family.


175
0:12:24,93 --> 0:12:27,6
There's maybe five or six
houses, each of which belong


176
0:12:27,6 --> 0:12:28,57
to a different member
of the family.


177
0:12:28,57 --> 0:12:31,55
No other house as far as the eye
can see in any direction.


178
0:12:31,55 --> 0:12:33,5
Closest town is about
a 20 minute drive.


179
0:12:33,5 --> 0:12:36,4
ROB SEMMER: I mean the guy lives
in complete isolation.


180
0:12:36,4 --> 0:12:38,11
No telephone, no nothing.


181
0:12:38,11 --> 0:12:39,99
I had to walk.


182
0:12:39,99 --> 0:12:43,37
His brother was the only one who
had plumbing in the house.


183
0:12:43,37 --> 0:12:46,18
And his brother lived about
a mile up the road.


184
0:12:46,18 --> 0:12:48,7
So every time I needed to take
a shit or anything, I had to


185
0:12:48,7 --> 0:12:52,6
walk literally in ankle high
mud because it had been


186
0:12:52,6 --> 0:12:59,52
raining for 72 days straight.


187
0:12:59,52 --> 0:13:1,5
IVAR BERGLIN: The first few
hours in Espedal were


188
0:13:1,5 --> 0:13:2,82
nerve-wracking to
say the least.


189
0:13:2,82 --> 0:13:4,87
I couldn't stop thinking about
what could happen over the


190
0:13:4,87 --> 0:13:5,77
next couple of days.


191
0:13:5,77 --> 0:13:8,21
But after a few bottles from
Gaahl's extensive wine


192
0:13:8,21 --> 0:13:10,64
collection, we all began
to loosen up, laugh,


193
0:13:10,64 --> 0:13:12,81
and have a good time.


194
0:13:12,81 --> 0:13:13,97
IVAR BERGLIN: You know we're
here because we're interested


195
0:13:13,97 --> 0:13:20,63
in the man behind all the spikes
and skull makeup and--


196
0:13:20,63 --> 0:13:21,46
GAAHL: Of course.


197
0:13:21,46 --> 0:13:23,71
This might be one
of my problems.


198
0:13:23,71 --> 0:13:31,1
When I talk to journalists, I
talk to them as persons and


199
0:13:31,1 --> 0:13:33,24
not as journalists.


200
0:13:33,24 --> 0:13:34,96
IVAR BERGLIN: To keep it
personal, Gaahl asked if


201
0:13:34,96 --> 0:13:37,48
instead of doing a traditional
interview, we could just put


202
0:13:37,48 --> 0:13:39,4
the camera on a tripod
and talk.


203
0:13:39,4 --> 0:13:42,96
GAAHL: What to follow the false
gods will do basically.


204
0:13:42,96 --> 0:13:50,41
You will be allowed to focus
on the god within yourself


205
0:13:50,41 --> 0:13:53,48
because that's the
only true god.


206
0:13:53,48 --> 0:13:54,73
The god within everything.


207
0:13:54,73 --> 0:13:57,27



208
0:13:57,27 --> 0:14:7,17
That's the only thing that for
me is worth calling god.


209
0:14:7,17 --> 0:14:9,78



210
0:14:9,78 --> 0:14:14,7
It is the highest spirit of
everything and not this


211
0:14:14,7 --> 0:14:19,81
control freak that's telling you
you're not supposed to do


212
0:14:19,81 --> 0:14:24,56
this, you're not supposed to do
this, you're only supposed


213
0:14:24,56 --> 0:14:28,67
to bow down and kneel
before what I say.


214
0:14:28,67 --> 0:14:29,21
Don't think.


215
0:14:29,21 --> 0:14:35,5
It's more than anything else.


216
0:14:35,5 --> 0:14:36,63
God is within man.


217
0:14:36,63 --> 0:14:40,63
God is within nature, and
nature will always grow.


218
0:14:40,63 --> 0:14:44,305
That's the force of all
life is to grow.


219
0:14:44,305 --> 0:14:50,25



220
0:14:50,25 --> 0:14:52,65
ROB SEMMER: He personally took
us all aside and critiqued us


221
0:14:52,65 --> 0:14:54,79
on what he thinks we
could change about


222
0:14:54,79 --> 0:14:55,44
our lives and shit.


223
0:14:55,44 --> 0:14:58,79
And it's like he met us
like a day before.


224
0:14:58,79 --> 0:15:1,27
And the thing that was blowing
all of our minds, and we all


225
0:15:1,27 --> 0:15:4,2
got together the next day and
had these little huddles when


226
0:15:4,2 --> 0:15:7,17
he wasn't around to talk about
it, was how right on he was.


227
0:15:7,17 --> 0:15:9,7
PETER BESTE: I think everyone
was just speaking very freely,


228
0:15:9,7 --> 0:15:13,1
and, of course, the wine was
flowing, and I think we all


229
0:15:13,1 --> 0:15:16,23
saw a special side to Gaahl.


230
0:15:16,23 --> 0:15:17,78
PATRIZIA MAZZUOCCOLO: There
are many sides to him.


231
0:15:17,78 --> 0:15:20,53
I think there's many sides
to every human being.


232
0:15:20,53 --> 0:15:24,21
And of course, we can all be
a little evil sometimes.


233
0:15:24,21 --> 0:15:27,675
DAVID: The kind of character
that he is scares people.


234
0:15:27,675 --> 0:15:31,11
How direct he is about
what he believes in.


235
0:15:31,11 --> 0:15:34,69
ERLEND ERICHSEN: One single word
me and Gaahl never will


236
0:15:34,69 --> 0:15:36,77
forget, and that's honest.


237
0:15:36,77 --> 0:15:38,42
The word honest.


238
0:15:38,42 --> 0:15:40,21
PETER BESTE: This guy that has
a reputation of being a


239
0:15:40,21 --> 0:15:43,5
bad-ass and a satanist and all
sorts of other things, the


240
0:15:43,5 --> 0:15:46,45
rednecks out there want to
challenge him, or fuck with


241
0:15:46,45 --> 0:15:48,474
him just like it would be in the
States growing up if you


242
0:15:48,474 --> 0:15:49,81
were one of these
kind of guys.


243
0:15:49,81 --> 0:15:52,16
So I think he gets people
who will mess with


244
0:15:52,16 --> 0:15:52,75
him a little bit.


245
0:15:52,75 --> 0:15:58,67
And when he, as he says, when
someone crosses my borders or


246
0:15:58,67 --> 0:16:1,19
steps on his foot, so
to speak, that he


247
0:16:1,19 --> 0:16:2,63
teaches them a lesson.


248
0:16:2,63 --> 0:16:4,14
ROB SEMMER: We were walking down
the road one day, and he


249
0:16:4,14 --> 0:16:7,95
showed me this little building,
and he's like,


250
0:16:7,95 --> 0:16:9,19
that's my schoolhouse.


251
0:16:9,19 --> 0:16:12,6
He's like, yeah, between
kindergarten and 18 years of


252
0:16:12,6 --> 0:16:15,45
age, I went to school there.


253
0:16:15,45 --> 0:16:18,901
And it was just me and
one other kid.


254
0:16:18,901 --> 0:16:21,9
I was like, for 18 years you
only went to school with one


255
0:16:21,9 --> 0:16:22,57
other person?


256
0:16:22,57 --> 0:16:24,22
And he was like, yeah
and that kid lived


257
0:16:24,22 --> 0:16:25,89
like 45 minutes away.


258
0:16:25,89 --> 0:16:29,25
So when school was done, he had
to get on a car or a bus


259
0:16:29,25 --> 0:16:29,83
to go home.


260
0:16:29,83 --> 0:16:32,86
Like I never got to
hang out with him.

0:16:32,86 --> 0:16:35,11

[INTERPOSING VOICES]


263
0:16:36,69 --> 0:16:41,34
GAAHL: Having an
excellent time.


264
0:16:41,34 --> 0:16:42,59
ROB SEMMER: It's
one of a kind.


265
0:16:42,59 --> 0:17:45,5



266
0:17:45,5 --> 0:17:48,68
GAAHL: I don't think of myself
as someone who can paint.


267
0:17:48,68 --> 0:17:53,33
That's why I quit art school
because you cannot go to


268
0:17:53,33 --> 0:17:54,25
school to become an artist.


269
0:17:54,25 --> 0:17:58,43
IVAR BERGLIN: I've seen
some of the stuff


270
0:17:58,43 --> 0:17:59,36
you did before prison.


271
0:17:59,36 --> 0:18:2,58
It would be interesting to see
something you did in prison.


272
0:18:2,58 --> 0:18:5,4
You and me talked about
how an extreme


273
0:18:5,4 --> 0:18:7,6
situation it was for you.


274
0:18:7,6 --> 0:18:11,81
GAAHL: My whole process of
creating is based on being


275
0:18:11,81 --> 0:18:16,184
away from people.


276
0:18:16,184 --> 0:18:19,69
I think this was the last one
I did before I went into


277
0:18:19,69 --> 0:18:20,52
prison maybe.


278
0:18:20,52 --> 0:18:21,2
IVAR BERGLIN: Yeah?


279
0:18:21,2 --> 0:18:22,45
GAAHL: I'm not certain.


280
0:18:22,45 --> 0:18:28,47



281
0:18:28,47 --> 0:18:30,78
IVAR BERGLIN: Gaahl rarely shows
anyone his paintings.


282
0:18:30,78 --> 0:18:32,52
He doesn't sell them,
and he hasn't shown


283
0:18:32,52 --> 0:18:34,54
publicly since 1993.


284
0:18:34,54 --> 0:18:37,13
So after days of asking, he
finally let us take a look.


285
0:18:37,13 --> 0:18:40,68



286
0:18:40,68 --> 0:18:46,81
GAAHL: I had an exhibition in
'93, and then I just wrote


287
0:18:46,81 --> 0:18:50,75
completely ridiculous prices,
way overpriced at first,


288
0:18:50,75 --> 0:18:52,76
because I didn't want
to sell them.


289
0:18:52,76 --> 0:18:57,6
There was this person that
wanted to buy it anyway, and I


290
0:18:57,6 --> 0:19:1,8
said, of course, that no,
I have already sold it.


291
0:19:1,8 --> 0:19:3,94
So he didn't get it.


292
0:19:3,94 --> 0:19:7,33
I have hidden them
away since then.


293
0:19:7,33 --> 0:19:15,65



294
0:19:15,65 --> 0:19:17,74
IVAR BERGLIN: On our third day
in Espedal, the rain finally


295
0:19:17,74 --> 0:19:20,38
let up, so we travelled to Dale,
the closest thing to


296
0:19:20,38 --> 0:19:22,795
Gaahl's house resembling
civilization.


297
0:19:22,795 --> 0:19:25,37
Yeah, Gaahl just told me that
the water's about one and a


298
0:19:25,37 --> 0:19:28,2
half to two meters higher than
it usually is because they've


299
0:19:28,2 --> 0:19:32,85
had 76 days of rain here
in a row, nonstop.


300
0:19:32,85 --> 0:19:35,51
I made several phone calls to
everyone from reporters to


301
0:19:35,51 --> 0:19:38,52
local police trying to get
anyone to comment on Gaahl.


302
0:19:38,52 --> 0:19:40,46
I was met with excuse
after excuse.


303
0:19:40,46 --> 0:19:43,15
It seemed like the whole town
was afraid of him until I


304
0:19:43,15 --> 0:19:45,35
finally convinced one journalist
that had followed


305
0:19:45,35 --> 0:19:48,45
his case since the beginning to
give me a brief interview.

307
0:19:49,7 --> 0:20:0,11



308
0:20:0,11 --> 0:20:1,74
PETER BESTE: The more recent
case that he just got out of


309
0:20:1,74 --> 0:20:3,41
prison for was something
similar.


310
0:20:3,41 --> 0:20:6,38
He was attacked, he beat this
guy, held him down for a


311
0:20:6,38 --> 0:20:11,65
number of hours, I think tied
him up, while slapping him.


312
0:20:11,65 --> 0:20:16,92
Supposedly squeezing his balls,
singing to him pretty


313
0:20:16,92 --> 0:20:19,29
Norwegian lullabies while
collecting his


314
0:20:19,29 --> 0:20:20,2
blood into a cup.


315
0:20:20,2 --> 0:20:23,22
The courts tried to say that he
drank the guy's blood, or


316
0:20:23,22 --> 0:20:25,28
he forced the guy to drink his
own blood, but Gaahl claims it


317
0:20:25,28 --> 0:20:28,18
was just to prevent it from
getting on his carpet.


318
0:20:28,18 --> 0:20:30,77
GAAHL: All of them have been
just self-defense actually.


319
0:20:30,77 --> 0:20:34,4



320
0:20:34,4 --> 0:20:37,43
But that I've crossed borders.


321
0:20:37,43 --> 0:20:38,47
It's like with a painting.


322
0:20:38,47 --> 0:20:41,63
You don't stop until
it's finished.


323
0:20:41,63 --> 0:20:48,55



324
0:20:48,55 --> 0:20:51,225
IVAR BERGLIN: And you think your
punishment methods have


325
0:20:51,225 --> 0:20:51,84
been effective?


326
0:20:51,84 --> 0:20:54,486
Of course these people aren't
going to attack you again, but


327
0:20:54,486 --> 0:20:58,93
do you think you removed the
sickness from their mind that


328
0:20:58,93 --> 0:21:2,3
would allow them to do this
in the first place?


329
0:21:2,3 --> 0:21:3,582
Or do you think you just
perpetuated it?


330
0:21:3,582 --> 0:21:7,47



331
0:21:7,47 --> 0:21:13,31
GAAHL: Let's put it this way, if
they were a bad seed, they


332
0:21:13,31 --> 0:21:15,46
wouldn't spread it.

GAAHL: Just by saying no to
someone, punish them enough.


336
0:21:49,84 --> 0:21:57,8
And someone, you probably need
to cut to small pieces and sew


337
0:21:57,8 --> 0:21:59,5
back together.

0:21:59,5 --> 0:22:15,66



339
0:22:15,66 --> 0:22:17,36
IVAR BERGLIN: From the day we
met Gaahl, he kept talking


340
0:22:17,36 --> 0:22:19,34
about bringing us to a
place that was very


341
0:22:19,34 --> 0:22:20,43
important to him.


342
0:22:20,43 --> 0:22:23,37
After three days of waiting on a
window of decent weather, we


343
0:22:23,37 --> 0:22:26,15
threw caution to the wind and
followed him blindly into the


344
0:22:26,15 --> 0:22:27,6
wilderness.


345
0:22:27,6 --> 0:22:28,52
Only three of us had jackets.


346
0:22:28,52 --> 0:22:30,3
Only two of us had boots.


347
0:22:30,3 --> 0:22:33,22
And none of us had any idea
where he'd take us.


348
0:22:33,22 --> 0:22:36,37
GAAHL: Up there, it's this
waterfall I was talking about.


349
0:22:36,37 --> 0:22:38,92
IVAR BERGLIN: Yeah, we can
get across the river.


350
0:22:38,92 --> 0:22:42,21
GAAHL: I don't think so, but
maybe we can walk up there and


351
0:22:42,21 --> 0:22:43,68
walk around.


352
0:22:43,68 --> 0:22:45,51
IVAR BERGLIN: Let's do that.


353
0:22:45,51 --> 0:22:47,45
GAAHL: It's quite a long
journey though.


354
0:22:47,45 --> 0:22:48,967
IVAR BERGLIN: Let's see
how long we make it.


355
0:22:48,967 --> 0:23:3,4



356
0:23:3,4 --> 0:23:5,31
PETER BESTE: From the valley,
he pointed out where we were


357
0:23:5,31 --> 0:23:8,28
headed, and it was this
snow-capped mountain off in


358
0:23:8,28 --> 0:23:8,82
the distance.


359
0:23:8,82 --> 0:23:9,97
And I thought he was joking.


360
0:23:9,97 --> 0:23:10,93
It was quite far.


361
0:23:10,93 --> 0:23:13,18
ROB SEMMER: So I put on
basically every piece of


362
0:23:13,18 --> 0:23:15,9
clothing I had in my bag.


363
0:23:15,9 --> 0:23:18,12
I was wearing a pair of Nike
hi-tops with plastic bags


364
0:23:18,12 --> 0:23:19,526
wrapped around my feet.


365
0:23:19,526 --> 0:23:35,43



366
0:23:35,43 --> 0:23:37,97
GAAHL: I have become what never
fails, following in the


367
0:23:37,97 --> 0:23:40,8
footsteps behind me.


368
0:23:40,8 --> 0:23:44,89
I don't like to explain things
to people because it's written


369
0:23:44,89 --> 0:23:48,75
in a way that it should
open the mind of the


370
0:23:48,75 --> 0:23:50,16
listeners on tours.


371
0:23:50,16 --> 0:23:53,26



372
0:23:53,26 --> 0:23:57,65
I have no interest in getting
a flock of sheep that's just


373
0:23:57,65 --> 0:24:0,56
following me because I'm the
same one direction, and they


374
0:24:0,56 --> 0:24:1,56
walk that direction.


375
0:24:1,56 --> 0:24:5,2
Then I would be just as
bad as society is.


376
0:24:5,2 --> 0:24:11,27
So fear is necessary to separate
the ones that's


377
0:24:11,27 --> 0:24:13,31
willing to be led.


378
0:24:13,31 --> 0:24:16,63
Or the one who choose
to lead himself.

towards it as fans.


384
0:24:28,99 --> 0:24:31,54



385
0:24:31,54 --> 0:24:35,52
There's so many low-lifes

0:24:35,52 --> 0:24:39,8
There's so many just there for
the music and nothing else.

You don't perform black metal

0:24:43,34 --> 0:24:50,13
Black metal is a war against
what everyone knows.


389
0:24:50,13 --> 0:24:52,77
IVAR BERGLIN:
[SPEAKING NORWEGIAN]


390
0:24:52,77 --> 0:24:54,9
GAAHL: [SPEAKING NORWEGIAN]


391
0:24:54,9 --> 0:24:55,34
IVAR BERGLIN:
[SPEAKING NORWEGIAN]


392
0:24:55,34 --> 0:25:2,82



393
0:25:2,82 --> 0:25:6,21
GAAHL: As long as nature is
not allowed to rule by the


394
0:25:6,21 --> 0:25:9,48
laws of nature, there will
always be king, and there will


395
0:25:9,48 --> 0:25:10,73
always be slave.


396
0:25:10,73 --> 0:25:28,24



397
0:25:28,24 --> 0:26:14,34



398
0:26:14,34 --> 0:26:16,7
ROB SEMMER: And at this point
I just fucking went into a


399
0:26:16,7 --> 0:26:19,4
panic, and I was just like,
this is fucking stupid.


400
0:26:19,4 --> 0:26:19,94
I don't know.


401
0:26:19,94 --> 0:26:22,96
He won't even really tell us
where you're bringing us or


402
0:26:22,96 --> 0:26:26,4
why you're bringing us or
what this is about.


403
0:26:26,4 --> 0:26:29,2
At a point, I was just like, I
don't care what the fuck is at


404
0:26:29,2 --> 0:26:29,82
the top of the mountain.


405
0:26:29,82 --> 0:26:31,54
You know what I mean?


406
0:26:31,54 --> 0:26:32,59
It makes no difference to me.


407
0:26:32,59 --> 0:26:35,93
We're going to jeopardize this
whole entire project for some


408
0:26:35,93 --> 0:26:37,41
stupid fucking nature walk.


409
0:26:37,41 --> 0:26:38,73
This is about heavy metal.


410
0:26:38,73 --> 0:26:40,12
This is about a band.


411
0:26:40,12 --> 0:26:41,43
This isn't Field and
Stream magazine.


412
0:26:41,43 --> 0:27:11,414



413
0:27:11,414 --> 0:27:12,664
MIKE: Yeah, man.


414
0:27:12,664 --> 0:27:15,9



415
0:27:15,9 --> 0:27:17,11
MIKE: Well sit tight, and
I can go get them.


416
0:27:17,11 --> 0:27:18,44
ROB SEMMER: I can't sit tight.


417
0:27:18,44 --> 0:27:18,822
I'll freeze.


418
0:27:18,822 --> 0:27:18,95
Seriously.


419
0:27:18,95 --> 0:27:20,3
MIKE: What do you want
me to do, man?


420
0:27:20,3 --> 0:27:21,55
ROB SEMMER: I got
to keep going.


421
0:27:21,55 --> 0:27:24,0



422
0:27:24,0 --> 0:27:26,25
And I know, but the
way down, even.


423
0:27:26,25 --> 0:27:35,47



424
0:27:35,47 --> 0:27:36,85
PETER BESTE: Well, there's
no choice at this point.


425
0:27:36,85 --> 0:27:48,27



426
0:27:48,27 --> 0:27:50,5
GAAHL: The Superman.


427
0:27:50,5 --> 0:27:56,45
And the idea will always conquer
or always rise above,


428
0:27:56,45 --> 0:28:0,32
no matter what, but you can
not put down your sword


429
0:28:0,32 --> 0:28:1,81
because then you'll lose.


430
0:28:1,81 --> 0:28:9,98



431
0:28:9,98 --> 0:28:12,155
IVAR BERGLIN: So do you get
frustrated being a lone wolf,


432
0:28:12,155 --> 0:28:13,41
or do you like it?


433
0:28:13,41 --> 0:28:17,57
Being one of the very few people
who is worthy of the


434
0:28:17,57 --> 0:28:19,37
title of a lead person?


435
0:28:19,37 --> 0:28:22,29



436
0:28:22,29 --> 0:28:23,54
Is it lonely?


437
0:28:23,54 --> 0:28:27,2



438
0:28:27,2 --> 0:28:33,32
GAAHL: I don't think that you
ask me the right questions.


439
0:28:33,32 --> 0:28:42,15
I don't think you're focusing
on what's being told.


440
0:28:42,15 --> 0:28:45,74



441
0:28:45,74 --> 0:28:46,99
IVAR BERGLIN: Guide me.


442
0:28:46,99 --> 0:30:46,99
