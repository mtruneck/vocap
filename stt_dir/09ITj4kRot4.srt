1
0:2:45,687 --> 0:2:48,607
At the end of the World War
Tomainia weakened.


2
0:2:48,607 --> 0:2:52,767
Revolution had broken out,
her diplomats sued for peace


3
0:2:52,767 --> 0:2:54,967
whiIe Tomainia's army fought on,


4
0:2:54,967 --> 0:2:59,527
confident its war machine
wouId smash the enemy's Iines.


5
0:2:59,527 --> 0:3:2,207
Big Bertha,
abIe to fire 100 miIes,


6
0:3:2,207 --> 0:3:4,607
was to make its appearance
on the Western Front,


7
0:3:4,607 --> 0:3:7,327
and strike terror into the enemy.


8
0:3:7,327 --> 0:3:14,287
75 miles away was her target:
the cathedral of Notre-Dame.


9
0:3:14,287 --> 0:3:19,847
Range: 95,452.


10
0:3:19,847 --> 0:3:21,447
Stand cIear!


11
0:3:21,447 --> 0:3:39,607
Fire!


12
0:3:39,607 --> 0:3:42,247
Stand by your trigger!


13
0:3:42,247 --> 0:3:49,47
Range correction: 95,455.


14
0:3:49,47 --> 0:3:50,407
Breach secured.


15
0:3:50,407 --> 0:3:51,607
Stand cIear.


16
0:3:51,607 --> 0:4:8,407
Ready... Fire!


17
0:4:8,407 --> 0:4:20,807
Defective sheII. We'II examine it.


18
0:4:20,807 --> 0:4:22,207
Check the fuse.


19
0:4:22,207 --> 0:4:57,207
Yes, the fuse.


20
0:4:57,207 --> 0:5:13,727
Look out! Run!


21
0:5:13,727 --> 0:5:14,687
What's that?


22
0:5:14,687 --> 0:5:16,607
- Air raid.
- After Big Bertha.


23
0:5:16,607 --> 0:5:18,287
The anti-aircraft gun!


24
0:5:18,287 --> 0:5:44,807
To the gun!


25
0:5:44,807 --> 0:5:47,7
Have you gone crazy?


26
0:5:47,7 --> 0:5:58,607
Come down!


27
0:5:58,607 --> 0:6:2,727
What do you think you're doing?
Have you gone crazy?


28
0:6:2,727 --> 0:6:6,607
Sir, the enemy have broken through.
Every man to the front.


29
0:6:6,607 --> 0:6:11,727
Muster the gun crew!


30
0:6:11,727 --> 0:6:15,167
Get your hand grenades, soIdiers.


31
0:6:15,167 --> 0:6:19,207
Where's your hand grenade?


32
0:6:19,207 --> 0:6:25,687
Give him one.


33
0:6:25,687 --> 0:6:29,647
Keep moving. Come aIong, hurry up!


34
0:6:29,647 --> 0:6:31,767
Pardon me, but to work this...


35
0:6:31,767 --> 0:6:46,327
PuII the pin,
count to ten and throw it!


36
0:6:46,327 --> 0:7:7,807
Let them have it!


37
0:7:7,807 --> 0:7:13,807
This is no time to scratch.


38
0:7:13,807 --> 0:7:16,207
PuII yourseIf together.


39
0:7:16,207 --> 0:7:18,647
Take this.


40
0:7:18,647 --> 0:7:21,47
Forward!


41
0:7:21,47 --> 0:7:23,327
FaII in!


42
0:7:23,327 --> 0:7:30,127
Hey you, come on!


43
0:7:30,127 --> 0:7:34,167
Order arms!


44
0:7:34,167 --> 0:7:35,847
Prepare to attack.


45
0:7:35,847 --> 0:8:17,7
Forward!


46
0:8:17,7 --> 0:8:29,247
There you are.


47
0:8:29,247 --> 0:8:39,687
The enemy!
Come on, Iet's get him!


48
0:8:39,687 --> 0:8:41,127
May I come in, sir?


49
0:8:41,127 --> 0:8:47,527
- Who is it?
- Friend.


50
0:8:47,527 --> 0:8:49,967
- What division?
- 21st artiIIery, sir.


51
0:8:49,967 --> 0:9:11,367
Take this and keep firing.
I'II be back.


52
0:9:11,367 --> 0:9:18,607
Comrade! HeIp!


53
0:9:18,607 --> 0:9:19,487
What is it?


54
0:9:19,487 --> 0:9:25,487
I'm exhausted.
Quick, heIp me to my pIane.


55
0:9:25,487 --> 0:9:29,287
Thank you. I'II see you get
the Tomainian Cross for this.


56
0:9:29,287 --> 0:9:41,7
OnIy too wiIIing to obIige, sir.


57
0:9:41,7 --> 0:9:42,887
You saved my Iife. Thank you.


58
0:9:42,887 --> 0:9:44,327
I'II strap you in.


59
0:9:44,327 --> 0:9:48,487
I can't make it aIone.
You'II have to stay with me.


60
0:9:48,487 --> 0:9:49,847
Can you fIy?


61
0:9:49,847 --> 0:9:52,567
I can try.


62
0:9:52,567 --> 0:9:56,727
Lift my hand to the stick.
I haven't the strength.


63
0:9:56,727 --> 0:9:59,527
Take charge of that gun!


64
0:9:59,527 --> 0:10:4,527
The enemy!
Quick, Iift my hand to the throttIe.


65
0:10:4,527 --> 0:10:26,407
We'II fooI 'em!


66
0:10:26,407 --> 0:10:28,367
HoId on to these dispatches.


67
0:10:28,367 --> 0:10:30,607
If we get them
to GeneraI SchmeIIoffeI,


68
0:10:30,607 --> 0:10:34,207
Tomainia may yet win.


69
0:10:34,207 --> 0:10:35,647
I'm going to faint.


70
0:10:35,647 --> 0:10:37,927
Don't say that.


71
0:10:37,927 --> 0:10:46,967
Sorry.


72
0:10:46,967 --> 0:10:48,207
Where am I?


73
0:10:48,207 --> 0:10:52,207
Don't you know me?


74
0:10:52,207 --> 0:10:54,447
Yes, I feeI better now.


75
0:10:54,447 --> 0:10:56,447
The bIood's returning to my head.


76
0:10:56,447 --> 0:10:58,207
What's beIow?.


77
0:10:58,207 --> 0:11:0,247
The sun?


78
0:11:0,247 --> 0:11:1,767
Shining upwards.


79
0:11:1,767 --> 0:11:3,927
Strange. How's the gas?


80
0:11:3,927 --> 0:11:5,487
Kept me awake aII night.


81
0:11:5,487 --> 0:11:8,567
No, the gasoIine in the tank!


82
0:11:8,567 --> 0:11:9,607
AImost empty.


83
0:11:9,607 --> 0:11:14,7
We must be nearIy there.
What time is it?


84
0:11:14,7 --> 0:11:22,7
ApproximateIy one minute to tweIve.


85
0:11:22,7 --> 0:11:29,647
Strange.


86
0:11:29,647 --> 0:11:37,847
We seem to be defying
the Iaws of gravity.


87
0:11:37,847 --> 0:11:40,167
Water. Quick, I'm going to faint.


88
0:11:40,167 --> 0:11:42,207
Wait a whiIe.


89
0:11:42,207 --> 0:11:46,847
We'II get into troubIe
if you faint any more.


90
0:11:46,847 --> 0:11:49,247
Just hoId it.


91
0:11:49,247 --> 0:11:58,207
I think I... Now...


92
0:11:58,207 --> 0:12:0,567
Take it!


93
0:12:0,567 --> 0:12:2,807
Something's wrong.


94
0:12:2,807 --> 0:12:7,527
I can't reach it.


95
0:12:7,527 --> 0:12:9,487
It's aII gone.


96
0:12:9,487 --> 0:12:10,727
What's the matter?


97
0:12:10,727 --> 0:12:11,967
BeIt too tight.


98
0:12:11,967 --> 0:12:12,967
Loosen it.


99
0:12:12,967 --> 0:12:16,487
I'm trying to!


100
0:12:16,487 --> 0:12:17,807
We're upside down.


101
0:12:17,807 --> 0:12:18,767
I know it!


102
0:12:18,767 --> 0:12:19,807
The stick!


103
0:12:19,807 --> 0:12:21,607
ImpossibIe.


104
0:12:21,607 --> 0:12:24,567
There it goes. We're out of gas.


105
0:12:24,567 --> 0:12:28,327
WeII, I suppose this is the end.
Cigarette?


106
0:12:28,327 --> 0:12:29,527
Not now!


107
0:12:29,527 --> 0:12:31,527
I shan't need this any more.


108
0:12:31,527 --> 0:12:33,7
What month is it?


109
0:12:33,7 --> 0:12:36,567
ApriI. Spring in Tomainia.


110
0:12:36,567 --> 0:12:38,167
HiIda wiII be in the garden,


111
0:12:38,167 --> 0:12:40,127
tending the daffodiIs.


112
0:12:40,127 --> 0:12:42,807
How she Ioves daffodiIs!


113
0:12:42,807 --> 0:12:45,847
She'd never cut them
for fear of hurting them.


114
0:12:45,847 --> 0:12:49,647
It was Iike taking a Iife
to cut a daffodiI.


115
0:12:49,647 --> 0:12:57,487
Sweet, gentIe HiIda.


116
0:12:57,487 --> 0:12:59,527
A beautifuI souI.


117
0:12:59,527 --> 0:13:8,727
She Ioved animaIs,
and IittIe chiIdren, too.


118
0:13:8,727 --> 0:13:11,367
We've Ianded! Dispatches!


119
0:13:11,367 --> 0:13:19,47
Comrade, where are you?


120
0:13:19,47 --> 0:13:24,807
The dispatches... Where are they?


121
0:13:24,807 --> 0:13:28,247
- Are you hurt?
- Take me to GeneraI SchmeIIoffeI.


122
0:13:28,247 --> 0:13:31,47
If we don't deIiver these,
we're defeated.


123
0:13:31,47 --> 0:13:32,527
- The war's over.
- What?


124
0:13:32,527 --> 0:14:27,487
We Iost.


125
0:14:27,487 --> 0:14:30,127
HynkeI takes power.
The Jewish soIdier


126
0:14:30,127 --> 0:14:34,807
suffered a Ioss of memory
and remained in hospitaI for years,


127
0:14:34,807 --> 0:14:37,607
ignorant of the change in Tomainia.


128
0:14:37,607 --> 0:14:40,167
HynkeI ruIed the nation
with an iron fist.


129
0:14:40,167 --> 0:14:44,127
Under the doubIe-cross embIem
Iiberty was banished.


130
0:14:44,127 --> 0:15:28,927
OnIy the voice of HynkeI
was heard.


131
0:15:28,927 --> 0:15:30,367
Adenoid HynkeI said,


132
0:15:30,367 --> 0:15:52,367
''Tomainia was down
but today has risen.''


133
0:15:52,367 --> 0:15:55,927
''Democracy is fragrant.''


134
0:15:55,927 --> 0:16:0,207
''Liberty is odious.''


135
0:16:0,207 --> 0:16:5,727
''Freedom of speech
is objectionabIe.''


136
0:16:5,727 --> 0:16:9,687
''Tomainia has the greatest army.''


137
0:16:9,687 --> 0:16:15,687
''The greatest navy.''


138
0:16:15,687 --> 0:16:21,767
''But to remain great
we must sacrifice.''


139
0:16:21,767 --> 0:16:38,767
''We must tighten our beIts.''


140
0:16:38,767 --> 0:16:51,847
He now speaks to FieId MarshaI
Herring, Minister of War.


141
0:16:51,847 --> 0:17:4,447
Now Herr Garbitsch,
Minister of the Interior.


142
0:17:4,447 --> 0:17:6,767
He remembers his earIy struggIes,


143
0:17:6,767 --> 0:18:40,607
shared by his two IoyaI comrades.


144
0:18:40,607 --> 0:19:33,847
A reference to the Jewish peopIe.


145
0:19:33,847 --> 0:19:36,847
The Phooey remarks
that for the worId


146
0:19:36,847 --> 0:20:8,247
he has peace in his heart.


147
0:20:8,247 --> 0:20:10,967
We now pause
for station identification.


148
0:20:10,967 --> 0:20:13,887
This is the Pari-MutuaI network,
bringing you


149
0:20:13,887 --> 0:20:16,967
HynkeI's address to the chiIdren
of the doubIe-cross.


150
0:20:16,967 --> 0:20:18,127
The interpreter


151
0:20:18,127 --> 0:20:20,527
is HynkeI's personaI transIator,


152
0:20:20,527 --> 0:20:23,167
reading from a prepared manuscript.


153
0:20:23,167 --> 0:20:26,927
Stand by for further commentary.
Go ahead, Tomainia.


154
0:20:26,927 --> 0:20:36,887
His ExceIIency
is about to descend the stairs.


155
0:20:36,887 --> 0:21:10,127
Your ExceIIency, are you hurt?


156
0:21:10,127 --> 0:21:20,327
Ride in the other car.


157
0:21:20,327 --> 0:21:21,687
His ExceIIency


158
0:21:21,687 --> 0:21:26,127
seems pIeased as he is greeted
by Tomainian chiIdren.


159
0:21:26,127 --> 0:21:31,487
He pauses before a woman
with a chiId.


160
0:21:31,487 --> 0:21:33,487
Camera!


161
0:21:33,487 --> 0:21:35,207
Even the baby is thriIIed


162
0:21:35,207 --> 0:22:1,487
and seems aII smiIes
at the attention.


163
0:22:1,487 --> 0:22:3,807
His ExceIIency Ieaves the scene


164
0:22:3,807 --> 0:22:5,687
and wiII return
aIong HynkeIstrasse,


165
0:22:5,687 --> 0:22:8,927
where he'II pass Tomainia's
modern masterpieces:


166
0:22:8,927 --> 0:22:20,87
the Venus of Today
and the Thinker of Tomorrow.


167
0:22:20,87 --> 0:22:22,167
- How was it?
- The speech?


168
0:22:22,167 --> 0:22:23,687
Very good.


169
0:22:23,687 --> 0:22:26,687
Your reference to the Jews
might have been more vioIent.


170
0:22:26,687 --> 0:22:27,807
What?


171
0:22:27,807 --> 0:22:29,527
To arouse the peopIe's anger.


172
0:22:29,527 --> 0:22:34,647
VioIence against the Jews might make
the peopIe forget their stomach.


173
0:22:34,647 --> 0:23:1,407
You're right. Things have been quiet
in the ghetto IateIy.


174
0:23:1,407 --> 0:23:3,367
Good morning, Mr JaeckeI.


175
0:23:3,367 --> 0:23:4,767
What's good about it?


176
0:23:4,767 --> 0:23:6,807
Conditions couId be worse.


177
0:23:6,807 --> 0:23:10,127
If you think so,
you have a great imagination.


178
0:23:10,127 --> 0:23:12,327
You heard HynkeI's speech.


179
0:23:12,327 --> 0:23:15,607
I heard nothing.
I've got my own troubIes.


180
0:23:15,607 --> 0:23:18,487
You're better off
than a Iot of peopIe.


181
0:23:18,487 --> 0:23:20,287
What about the barber?


182
0:23:20,287 --> 0:23:21,927
StiII in hospitaI.


183
0:23:21,927 --> 0:23:25,687
He's been there since the war.


184
0:23:25,687 --> 0:23:28,327
Why not rent
his barbershop for him?


185
0:23:28,327 --> 0:23:33,167
He won't Iet me. Every few weeks
he writes to say he's coming back.


186
0:23:33,167 --> 0:23:36,47
A pity it shouId be idIe
aII these years.


187
0:23:36,47 --> 0:23:37,807
Why worry?


188
0:23:37,807 --> 0:23:40,767
The government
wiII soon take it from him.


189
0:23:40,767 --> 0:23:44,927
Perhaps you're right.
Not such a good morning after aII.


190
0:23:44,927 --> 0:23:47,767
Now you said it.


191
0:23:47,767 --> 0:23:50,247
Hannah.


192
0:23:50,247 --> 0:23:56,367
On the manteIpiece is my tobacco
pouch. WiII you get it?


193
0:23:56,367 --> 0:23:58,247
Everyone is fuII of troubIes.


194
0:23:58,247 --> 0:24:2,47
Yeah, everyone.
Look at Hannah, poor girI.


195
0:24:2,47 --> 0:24:4,487
A hard worker, can't get ajob.


196
0:24:4,487 --> 0:24:7,927
Father was kiIIed in the war,
mother died Iast year.


197
0:24:7,927 --> 0:24:10,247
Can't earn enough to pay her rent.


198
0:24:10,247 --> 0:24:21,367
What can I do?
I can't throw her out.


199
0:24:21,367 --> 0:24:22,727
You need some more.


200
0:24:22,727 --> 0:24:25,807
- Where are you going?
- Mrs Shoemaker's Iaundry.


201
0:24:25,807 --> 0:24:30,327
You'd better take the key.
Mrs JaeckeI and I are going out.


202
0:24:30,327 --> 0:24:31,647
I'm Iocking up


203
0:24:31,647 --> 0:24:47,127
in case the storm troopers
start their monkey business again.


204
0:24:47,127 --> 0:24:52,7
Aryan! We're Aryans!


205
0:24:52,7 --> 0:24:56,47
And we go marching by!


206
0:24:56,47 --> 0:25:1,887
Look, feIIows!
Tomatoes and potatoes.


207
0:25:1,887 --> 0:25:7,367
I'II take a box home.


208
0:25:7,367 --> 0:25:9,247
Hey, the Iorry.


209
0:25:9,247 --> 0:25:13,407
HoId it there, wiII you?


210
0:25:13,407 --> 0:25:14,967
You have no right!


211
0:25:14,967 --> 0:25:20,647
Just charge it to my account!


212
0:25:20,647 --> 0:25:22,487
Nice ripe tomatoes.


213
0:25:22,487 --> 0:25:24,887
Why don't some of you
do something?


214
0:25:24,887 --> 0:25:27,167
If I were a man I'd show you.


215
0:25:27,167 --> 0:25:29,7
What wouId you do, pretty?


216
0:25:29,7 --> 0:25:33,687
Not one of you has the guts
to stand up aIone and fight!


217
0:25:33,687 --> 0:25:36,87
Is the Iorry
in case someone hits back?


218
0:25:36,87 --> 0:25:37,327
Shut up!


219
0:25:37,327 --> 0:25:40,447
Come and take me.
You'II get medaIs for it.


220
0:25:40,447 --> 0:25:43,607
You pick on women
and rob defenceIess peopIe.


221
0:25:43,607 --> 0:26:25,687
Don't rob the poor girI, boys.
Give her back her tomatoes.


222
0:26:25,687 --> 0:26:30,207
I'II have to do it again.


223
0:26:30,207 --> 0:26:35,87
Pigs!


224
0:26:35,87 --> 0:26:37,807
- Patient 33!
- Yes, sir.


225
0:26:37,807 --> 0:26:40,167
An interesting case: amnesia.


226
0:26:40,167 --> 0:26:42,607
Jewish soIdier.
Been here since the war.


227
0:26:42,607 --> 0:26:44,567
He thinks it's onIy been weeks.


228
0:26:44,567 --> 0:26:46,767
Does he knows what's happened?


229
0:26:46,767 --> 0:26:50,47
No. His one interest
seems to be in his barbershop,


230
0:26:50,47 --> 0:26:52,807
which he beIieves he Ieft
a few weeks ago.


231
0:26:52,807 --> 0:26:54,887
He'II have many surprises.


232
0:26:54,887 --> 0:26:57,487
I'm afraid so.


233
0:26:57,487 --> 0:26:59,487
- Yes?
- Number 33 is gone.


234
0:26:59,487 --> 0:27:1,407
He was to be examined.


235
0:27:1,407 --> 0:27:3,87
But he's disappeared.


236
0:27:3,87 --> 0:27:4,247
Disappeared?


237
0:27:4,247 --> 0:27:7,407
Let him go.
It isn't a serious case.


238
0:27:7,407 --> 0:28:30,847
There's IittIe we can do for him.


239
0:28:30,847 --> 0:28:59,487
Come on, get out of here!


240
0:28:59,487 --> 0:29:1,607
What are you doing?


241
0:29:1,607 --> 0:29:2,567
I don't know.


242
0:29:2,567 --> 0:29:5,367
Leave that aIone.


243
0:29:5,367 --> 0:29:7,407
- Don't be siIIy.
- I'm not siIIy!


244
0:29:7,407 --> 0:29:8,727
I appreciate that.


245
0:29:8,727 --> 0:29:11,407
When you taIk to me, ''HaiI HynkeI''!


246
0:29:11,407 --> 0:29:14,647
Who are you?


247
0:29:14,647 --> 0:29:18,367
I'II show you who I am!
Come down to headquarters!


248
0:29:18,367 --> 0:29:19,247
That's my shop.


249
0:29:19,247 --> 0:29:21,767
I don't care if it is or not.


250
0:29:21,767 --> 0:29:27,127
Going to put up a fight, are you?
Come to headquarters.


251
0:29:27,127 --> 0:29:32,367
Let me teII you something.


252
0:29:32,367 --> 0:29:35,287
PoIiceman?
Arrest that man for assauIt.


253
0:29:35,287 --> 0:29:37,287
- Come here, you!
- Leave me aIone.


254
0:29:37,287 --> 0:29:40,47
Attacking a storm trooper!


255
0:29:40,47 --> 0:29:47,607
You'II hear from my Iawyer.


256
0:29:47,607 --> 0:30:38,527
He bit my finger!


257
0:30:38,527 --> 0:30:41,7
Sorry, I didn't mean to hit you.


258
0:30:41,7 --> 0:30:42,967
I enjoyed that.


259
0:30:42,967 --> 0:30:44,887
But you'd better beat it.


260
0:30:44,887 --> 0:30:46,807
- I'II caII a poIiceman.
- No!


261
0:30:46,807 --> 0:30:48,807
- Why not?
- Are you crazy?


262
0:30:48,807 --> 0:30:50,247
More are coming!


263
0:30:50,247 --> 0:30:58,247
- More what?
- Wait!


264
0:30:58,247 --> 0:31:2,527
Come in here.


265
0:31:2,527 --> 0:31:14,87
What's wrong with you?
Don't be fooIhardy.


266
0:31:14,87 --> 0:31:16,647
What's this? Who hit you?


267
0:31:16,647 --> 0:31:18,567
I think it was a gang.


268
0:31:18,567 --> 0:31:22,567
You'd better get fixed up.
We'II investigate Iater.


269
0:31:22,567 --> 0:31:44,167
What time is it?


270
0:31:44,167 --> 0:31:46,167
AII right, they've gone.


271
0:31:46,167 --> 0:31:52,807
Thanks, mister.
That did me a Iot of good.


272
0:31:52,807 --> 0:31:55,167
You've sure got some nerve.


273
0:31:55,167 --> 0:31:57,807
We shouId aII fight back.


274
0:31:57,807 --> 0:32:2,647
We can't fight aIone,
but we can Iick 'em together.


275
0:32:2,647 --> 0:32:24,647
We didn't do so bad.


276
0:32:24,647 --> 0:32:27,687
You're the barber,
who was in hospitaI!


277
0:32:27,687 --> 0:32:29,887
Mr JaeckeI has taIked about you.


278
0:32:29,887 --> 0:32:33,567
We didn't think you'd come back.


279
0:32:33,567 --> 0:32:37,207
The storm troopers
wiII be after you.


280
0:32:37,207 --> 0:32:48,207
You'd better hide.
I'II get the key to the ceIIar.


281
0:32:48,207 --> 0:32:50,767
- Is this the man?
- That's him.


282
0:32:50,767 --> 0:32:52,527
HaiI HynkeI!


283
0:32:52,527 --> 0:32:54,167
Who's he?


284
0:32:54,167 --> 0:32:58,487
Don't fooI with me. HaiI HynkeI!


285
0:32:58,487 --> 0:32:59,447
Your hands.


286
0:32:59,447 --> 0:33:6,287
Just a moment. Not here.
Bring him outside.


287
0:33:6,287 --> 0:33:10,847
First you'II finish this.
Here.


288
0:33:10,847 --> 0:33:50,287
Go on, paint that!


289
0:33:50,287 --> 0:34:9,967
Wait a minute, boys.
I've got a bright idea.


290
0:34:9,967 --> 0:34:17,367
Commander SchuItz!


291
0:34:17,367 --> 0:34:22,287
First in command.


292
0:34:22,287 --> 0:34:26,367
Second in command.


293
0:34:26,367 --> 0:34:28,287
Oh, never mind. You!


294
0:34:28,287 --> 0:34:31,687
Who toId you
to hang peopIe from Iampposts?


295
0:34:31,687 --> 0:34:34,207
What was the troubIe?


296
0:34:34,207 --> 0:34:36,7
A Jew attacking storm troopers.


297
0:34:36,7 --> 0:34:38,47
- Where is he?
- There.


298
0:34:38,47 --> 0:34:41,887
Break ranks.


299
0:34:41,887 --> 0:34:45,367
So there you are. Stand him up.


300
0:34:45,367 --> 0:34:52,447
Get up.


301
0:34:52,447 --> 0:34:56,607
You?
Don't you remember me?


302
0:34:56,607 --> 0:34:59,487
- You saved my Iife.
- Me?


303
0:34:59,487 --> 0:35:3,207
Strange. And I aIways thought
of you as an Aryan.


304
0:35:3,207 --> 0:35:4,727
I'm a vegetarian.


305
0:35:4,727 --> 0:35:8,127
Don't you remember?
We got away in my pIane.


306
0:35:8,127 --> 0:35:9,527
PIane?


307
0:35:9,527 --> 0:35:18,167
Then we crashed.


308
0:35:18,167 --> 0:35:21,367
Now I remember.


309
0:35:21,367 --> 0:35:22,647
WeII, how are you?


310
0:35:22,647 --> 0:35:23,807
What's my friend done?


311
0:35:23,807 --> 0:35:26,207
He resisted my men
painting his windows.


312
0:35:26,207 --> 0:35:28,287
Any brave man wouId resist.


313
0:35:28,287 --> 0:35:30,247
I'm sorry for this.


314
0:35:30,247 --> 0:35:31,407
No harm.


315
0:35:31,407 --> 0:35:34,727
In future you wiII not
be moIested again.


316
0:35:34,727 --> 0:35:40,7
If you or your friends
ever need heIp...


317
0:35:40,7 --> 0:35:43,87
Who did that?


318
0:35:43,87 --> 0:35:53,447
One of my friends.


319
0:35:53,447 --> 0:35:56,87
HynkeI's paIace was the centre


320
0:35:56,87 --> 0:35:58,927
of the worId's
greatest war machine.


321
0:35:58,927 --> 0:36:1,727
Behind it
was the dynamic Adenoid HynkeI,


322
0:36:1,727 --> 0:36:3,927
whose genius ran the nation,


323
0:36:3,927 --> 0:36:34,287
whose ceaseIess activity kept him
occupied every moment of the day.


324
0:36:34,287 --> 0:36:35,967
MarshaI Herring is waiting.


325
0:36:35,967 --> 0:36:40,567
Enough!


326
0:36:40,567 --> 0:36:43,167
I beIieve we've got something now.


327
0:36:43,167 --> 0:36:46,487
A buIIetproof uniform.
The materiaI is as Iight as siIk.


328
0:36:46,487 --> 0:36:47,407
Where?


329
0:36:47,407 --> 0:36:52,167
I've arranged for a demonstration.
It wiII onIy take two minutes.


330
0:36:52,167 --> 0:36:57,927
I can spare one.


331
0:36:57,927 --> 0:37:0,447
Professor Herr Kibitzen.


332
0:37:0,447 --> 0:37:4,127
Actions speak Iouder than words.
A buIIetproof uniform.


333
0:37:4,127 --> 0:37:8,47
One hundred percent perfect.


334
0:37:8,47 --> 0:37:14,727
Shoot!


335
0:37:14,727 --> 0:37:57,87
Far from perfect.


336
0:37:57,87 --> 0:37:59,247
- Where's my secretary?
- In the outer office.


337
0:37:59,247 --> 0:38:12,687
CaII her.


338
0:38:12,687 --> 0:38:39,327
Take a Ietter.


339
0:38:39,327 --> 0:38:42,807
Herring here in the tower room.
We've got something marveIIous.


340
0:38:42,807 --> 0:39:0,887
I shaII be up.


341
0:39:0,887 --> 0:39:3,927
A parachute.
The most compact in the worId.


342
0:39:3,927 --> 0:39:7,447
Worn Iike a hat.


343
0:39:7,447 --> 0:39:9,407
It wiII open in 25 feet.


344
0:39:9,407 --> 0:39:30,247
344: 0 344.


345
0:39:30,247 --> 0:39:44,767
Herring,
why do you waste my time Iike this?


346
0:39:44,767 --> 0:39:57,7
Send Garbitsch here.


347
0:39:57,7 --> 0:39:58,687
Herr Garbitsch is waiting.


348
0:39:58,687 --> 0:40:4,967
Enough!


349
0:40:4,967 --> 0:40:7,367
What's the meaning of this?


350
0:40:7,367 --> 0:40:10,807
25 miIIion for prison camps?
We need to manufacture munitions.


351
0:40:10,807 --> 0:40:13,247
- We've made a few arrests.
- How many?


352
0:40:13,247 --> 0:40:15,47
Five or ten thousand...


353
0:40:15,47 --> 0:40:16,327
a day.


354
0:40:16,327 --> 0:40:18,527
- A day?
- Just a few dissenters.


355
0:40:18,527 --> 0:40:19,607
Dissenting about?


356
0:40:19,607 --> 0:40:21,647
Working hours, wage cuts,


357
0:40:21,647 --> 0:40:25,247
the synthetic food, the quaIity
of the sawdust in the bread.


358
0:40:25,247 --> 0:40:31,127
What more do they want?
It's from the finest Iumber!


359
0:40:31,127 --> 0:40:35,487
NevertheIess, the peopIe
are overworked. They need diversion.


360
0:40:35,487 --> 0:40:36,807
The peopIe, bah!


361
0:40:36,807 --> 0:40:40,207
We might go further with the Jews.
Burn some of their houses.


362
0:40:40,207 --> 0:40:42,687
An assauIt on the ghetto.


363
0:40:42,687 --> 0:40:46,967
Something more dramatic. When can
we be ready to invade OsterIich?


364
0:40:46,967 --> 0:40:48,127
Three months.


365
0:40:48,127 --> 0:40:51,607
I can't wait.
NapaIoni's army might invade first.


366
0:40:51,607 --> 0:40:53,127
We must strike now.


367
0:40:53,127 --> 0:40:55,127
We'II require foreign capitaI.


368
0:40:55,127 --> 0:40:56,247
Borrow it!


369
0:40:56,247 --> 0:40:57,687
The bankers have refused.


370
0:40:57,687 --> 0:41:0,767
One man
might make us a Ioan: Epstein.


371
0:41:0,767 --> 0:41:4,767
- Epstein? He's a Jew, isn't he?
- Yes.


372
0:41:4,767 --> 0:41:9,247
WeII, Iet's be big about it.
We'II borrow from Epstein.


373
0:41:9,247 --> 0:41:12,407
It might be difficuIt in view
of our poIicy towards his peopIe.


374
0:41:12,407 --> 0:41:14,927
Then we'II change our poIicy.


375
0:41:14,927 --> 0:41:18,407
TeII SchuItz aII persecution
of the Jews must cease.


376
0:41:18,407 --> 0:41:27,447
At Ieast
tiII we've negotiated this Ioan.


377
0:41:27,447 --> 0:41:31,487
I don't understand it.
The whoIe ghetto is so quiet.


378
0:41:31,487 --> 0:41:34,527
You can't imagine
what was going on.


379
0:41:34,527 --> 0:41:36,967
This HynkeI business.


380
0:41:36,967 --> 0:41:40,767
You weren't here, you were
in the hospitaI, unconscious.


381
0:41:40,767 --> 0:41:45,367
You don't appreciate
what a good time you were having.


382
0:41:45,367 --> 0:41:48,567
If things get worse
we can go to OsterIich.


383
0:41:48,567 --> 0:41:50,607
That's stiII free.


384
0:41:50,607 --> 0:41:53,967
Sooner or Iater we'II have to go.


385
0:41:53,967 --> 0:41:57,447
Anyway, it's nice to see you back.


386
0:41:57,447 --> 0:42:0,407
It's Iike the oId days again, eh?


387
0:42:0,407 --> 0:42:1,927
How's business?


388
0:42:1,927 --> 0:42:5,87
Very sIow.


389
0:42:5,87 --> 0:42:8,287
The men are in concentration camp.


390
0:42:8,287 --> 0:42:11,47
You shouId fix up the women.


391
0:42:11,47 --> 0:42:14,7
The beauty parIour business.


392
0:42:14,7 --> 0:42:20,487
Know anything about it?


393
0:42:20,487 --> 0:42:26,767
You can Iearn.
You can practise on Hannah.


394
0:42:26,767 --> 0:42:30,447
Hannah, get in that chair,
we'II make you Iook beautifuI.


395
0:42:30,447 --> 0:42:32,127
What for?


396
0:42:32,127 --> 0:42:37,407
He's going to practise on you.


397
0:42:37,407 --> 0:42:39,647
Not with mud on my face?


398
0:42:39,647 --> 0:42:43,687
No, we'II take some off.


399
0:42:43,687 --> 0:42:45,447
Make me Iook beautifuI?


400
0:42:45,447 --> 0:42:51,687
Sure.
He can't make you Iook any worse!


401
0:42:51,687 --> 0:42:53,327
Mrs Shoemaker's Iaundry!


402
0:42:53,327 --> 0:42:58,407
I'II give it to her.
You sit here and enjoy yourseIf.


403
0:42:58,407 --> 0:43:4,527
I know.
I've seen you making eyes.


404
0:43:4,527 --> 0:43:9,487
Don't pay any attention to him.


405
0:43:9,487 --> 0:43:13,207
I Iike your shop
since it's fixed up.


406
0:43:13,207 --> 0:43:17,647
I wish I had a business Iike this.
There's no future in housework.


407
0:43:17,647 --> 0:43:21,407
Maybe if I save my money
I can have a barbershop some day.


408
0:43:21,407 --> 0:43:26,47
But I can never save.
Money sIips through my fingers.


409
0:43:26,47 --> 0:43:29,287
I've aIways Iived
up to every penny I've earned.


410
0:43:29,287 --> 0:43:34,447
Why shouIdn't I? You're here today
and gone tomorrow.


411
0:43:34,447 --> 0:43:36,527
Do you beIieve in God?


412
0:43:36,527 --> 0:43:40,407
I do. But if there wasn't one,
wouId you Iive any different?


413
0:43:40,407 --> 0:43:41,807
I wouIdn't.


414
0:43:41,807 --> 0:43:45,287
Life couId be wonderfuI
if peopIe'd Ieave you aIone.


415
0:43:45,287 --> 0:43:47,407
Things are Iooking brighter now.


416
0:43:47,407 --> 0:43:50,847
Maybe because of you saving SchuItz.


417
0:43:50,847 --> 0:43:53,487
Funny how they've Ieft us aIone.


418
0:43:53,487 --> 0:44:1,607
Too good to be true.


419
0:44:1,607 --> 0:44:5,647
Do you ever daydream?
I do.


420
0:44:5,647 --> 0:44:13,207
That's the onIy time
I'm reaIIy happy: dreaming.


421
0:44:13,207 --> 0:44:15,647
Sometimes I get so carried away
I don't know what I'm doing.


422
0:44:15,647 --> 0:44:19,7
Aren't you Iike that?


423
0:44:19,7 --> 0:44:21,207
We're very much aIike.


424
0:44:21,207 --> 0:44:28,87
- Both absent-minded.
- You think so?


425
0:44:28,87 --> 0:44:35,167
I Iike absent-minded peopIe.


426
0:44:35,167 --> 0:44:46,687
Like the man who put his watch
in boiIing water and heId the egg!


427
0:44:46,687 --> 0:44:51,287
AII great men are absent-minded.
It's a sign you're smart.


428
0:44:51,287 --> 0:44:56,127
My foIks didn't think so.


429
0:44:56,127 --> 0:44:59,647
You have an excuse.
You were injured in the war.


430
0:44:59,647 --> 0:45:8,887
I was born that way.


431
0:45:8,887 --> 0:45:20,407
I wonder
why women never grow whiskers.


432
0:45:20,407 --> 0:45:22,607
Isn't that fooIish of me?


433
0:45:22,607 --> 0:45:26,407
I couId kick myseIf in the shins,
I couId...


434
0:45:26,407 --> 0:45:43,647
I'II give you a shampoo.


435
0:45:43,647 --> 0:45:47,687
Ain't I cute?


436
0:45:47,687 --> 0:45:50,927
How did you do it?


437
0:45:50,927 --> 0:45:53,767
You shouId try it on yourseIf.


438
0:45:53,767 --> 0:46:0,967
Fixed up, you'd Iook handsome.


439
0:46:0,967 --> 0:46:3,927
Four pecks a pound, new potatoes!


440
0:46:3,927 --> 0:46:20,487
The potato man! I have to go.


441
0:46:20,487 --> 0:46:23,647
Take it easy there.


442
0:46:23,647 --> 0:46:31,7
Did you hurt yourseIf?


443
0:46:31,7 --> 0:46:36,807
- CarefuI next time.
- Here's another one.


444
0:46:36,807 --> 0:46:46,287
How do you do?


445
0:46:46,287 --> 0:46:50,527
Something's happened.
The storm troopers heIped me up.


446
0:46:50,527 --> 0:46:52,887
How wonderfuI
if they stopped hating us,


447
0:46:52,887 --> 0:46:56,647
if they Iet us go about our business
Iike we used to.


448
0:46:56,647 --> 0:47:0,207
How wonderfuI if we didn't have
to go to another country.


449
0:47:0,207 --> 0:47:1,807
I don't want to go.


450
0:47:1,807 --> 0:47:5,167
With aII the persecution,
I stiII Iove it here.


451
0:47:5,167 --> 0:47:7,607
Perhaps we don't have to go.


452
0:47:7,607 --> 0:47:47,167
WouIdn't it be wonderfuI if they'd
Iet us Iive and be happy again?


453
0:47:47,167 --> 0:48:16,447
FuII stop.


454
0:48:16,447 --> 0:48:18,847
Nothing works!
Not even a sharp penciI.


455
0:48:18,847 --> 0:48:22,367
I'm surrounded by incompetent,
stupid, steriIe stenographers.


456
0:48:22,367 --> 0:48:23,527
I'II get you a pen.


457
0:48:23,527 --> 0:48:26,847
Don't bother! I won't send it.


458
0:48:26,847 --> 0:48:33,687
Get out, get out!


459
0:48:33,687 --> 0:48:39,447
We've just discovered
the most wonderfuI poison gas.


460
0:48:39,447 --> 0:48:41,967
It wiII kiII everybody...


461
0:48:41,967 --> 0:48:44,127
AII right. Later.


462
0:48:44,127 --> 0:48:46,847
B76 to see Herr Herring.


463
0:48:46,847 --> 0:48:49,647
A Iady. My secret agent.


464
0:48:49,647 --> 0:48:52,327
Your secret agent?
TeII her to come here.


465
0:48:52,327 --> 0:48:55,847
Have B76 come right in.


466
0:48:55,847 --> 0:48:57,567
Any news from Epstein?


467
0:48:57,567 --> 0:49:1,247
Our agent reports that aII
the board of directors are Aryans.


468
0:49:1,247 --> 0:49:12,207
- The Ioan's bound to go through.
- Good.


469
0:49:12,207 --> 0:49:14,127
A strike at the arms factory.


470
0:49:14,127 --> 0:49:16,447
- The Ieader?
- Five of them.


471
0:49:16,447 --> 0:49:22,127
- Have them shot.
- They were.


472
0:49:22,127 --> 0:49:23,927
How many were going to strike?


473
0:49:23,927 --> 0:49:25,607
Three thousand of them.


474
0:49:25,607 --> 0:49:28,687
Have them aII shot.
I don't want dissatisfied workers.


475
0:49:28,687 --> 0:49:30,887
These men are skiIIed craftsmen.


476
0:49:30,887 --> 0:49:33,767
Let's train others first,
then shoot them!


477
0:49:33,767 --> 0:49:35,407
Cannot afford to be Ienient.


478
0:49:35,407 --> 0:49:37,887
The rhythm of production
wiII be affected.


479
0:49:37,887 --> 0:49:40,727
Rhythm...
AII right, have your rhythm.


480
0:49:40,727 --> 0:49:44,567
Spare the strikers and permit them
to return to work.


481
0:49:44,567 --> 0:49:47,407
But mark them for future reference.


482
0:49:47,407 --> 0:49:55,207
That's my department.
I'II attend to that. This way.


483
0:49:55,207 --> 0:49:59,7
The strike Ieaders are aII
brunettes. Not one bIond.


484
0:49:59,7 --> 0:50:1,87
TroubIemakers!
Worse than Jews.


485
0:50:1,87 --> 0:50:3,407
- Then wipe them out!
- ''Doucement''.


486
0:50:3,407 --> 0:50:7,367
We'II get rid of the Jews first,
then concentrate on the brunettes.


487
0:50:7,367 --> 0:50:10,967
We shaII never have peace
tiII we have a pure Aryan race.


488
0:50:10,967 --> 0:50:15,167
How wonderfuI! Tomainia,
a nation of bIue-eyed bIonds.


489
0:50:15,167 --> 0:50:18,127
Why not
a bIond Europe, Asia, America?


490
0:50:18,127 --> 0:50:20,767
- And a brunette dictator.
- Of the worId!


491
0:50:20,767 --> 0:50:22,487
Why not?


492
0:50:22,487 --> 0:50:26,567
Aut Caesar aut nuIIus. The worId's
effete, worn out, afraid.


493
0:50:26,567 --> 0:50:28,767
No nation wouId dare oppose you.


494
0:50:28,767 --> 0:50:29,967
Dictator of the WorId!


495
0:50:29,967 --> 0:50:34,367
It's your destiny. We'II kiII off
the Jews, wipe out the brunettes,


496
0:50:34,367 --> 0:50:37,87
then wiII come forth
a pure Aryan race.


497
0:50:37,87 --> 0:50:38,487
BeautifuI bIond Aryans.


498
0:50:38,487 --> 0:50:41,887
They wiII Iove you,
they wiII worship you as a god.


499
0:50:41,887 --> 0:50:47,447
No, you mustn't say it.


500
0:50:47,447 --> 0:50:57,287
You make me afraid of myseIf.


501
0:50:57,287 --> 0:50:59,407
Dictator of the WorId!


502
0:50:59,407 --> 0:51:3,327
We'II invade OsterIich first.
After that we can bIuff.


503
0:51:3,327 --> 0:51:5,247
The nations wiII capituIate.


504
0:51:5,247 --> 0:51:8,287
The worId wiII be under your thumb.


505
0:51:8,287 --> 0:51:40,367
Leave me! I want to be aIone.


506
0:51:40,367 --> 0:51:43,807
Aut Caesar aut nuIIus.


507
0:51:43,807 --> 0:51:49,887
Emperor of the WorId!


508
0:51:49,887 --> 0:53:38,487
My worId.


509
0:53:38,487 --> 0:53:40,807
The happy hour programme.


510
0:53:40,807 --> 0:53:43,487
Work with the rhythm of music.


511
0:53:43,487 --> 0:55:31,47
Our next seIection: Brahms'
Hungarian Dance number five.


512
0:55:31,47 --> 0:55:40,47
Fifteen cents, pIease.


513
0:55:40,47 --> 0:55:41,927
Happy hour signing off.


514
0:55:41,927 --> 0:55:44,487
At six, Adenoid HynkeI wiII address


515
0:55:44,487 --> 0:55:46,887
the chiIdren of the doubIe-cross.


516
0:55:46,887 --> 0:55:49,567
It seems Iike the oId days again.


517
0:55:49,567 --> 0:55:51,607
How Iong is it going to Iast?


518
0:55:51,607 --> 0:55:52,847
In the papers


519
0:55:52,847 --> 0:55:56,767
it's rumoured that HynkeI's going
to give the Jews back their rights.


520
0:55:56,767 --> 0:55:58,207
Maybe.


521
0:55:58,207 --> 0:55:59,607
What do you want?


522
0:55:59,607 --> 0:56:3,247
Business is much better.
Nobody interferes with us any more.


523
0:56:3,247 --> 0:56:6,967
Doesn't that make you feeI good?


524
0:56:6,967 --> 0:56:8,767
The troubIe, Mr JaeckeI,


525
0:56:8,767 --> 0:56:13,207
is you're so used to bad times,
you're unhappy without them.


526
0:56:13,207 --> 0:56:17,247
Get my Sunday shoes.
They're on the windowsiII.


527
0:56:17,247 --> 0:56:18,687
I can't find the shawI.


528
0:56:18,687 --> 0:56:20,247
I've got a shawI.


529
0:56:20,247 --> 0:56:21,727
What's going on?


530
0:56:21,727 --> 0:56:24,647
They're dressing Hannah up
to go out.


531
0:56:24,647 --> 0:56:26,527
Is that so?


532
0:56:26,527 --> 0:56:27,887
She's got a beau.


533
0:56:27,887 --> 0:56:30,567
- Who is it?
- The barber.


534
0:56:30,567 --> 0:56:34,447
Now, turn around.


535
0:56:34,447 --> 0:56:37,487
- My dear! Those hands!
- What's the matter with them?


536
0:56:37,487 --> 0:56:39,927
Those caIIuses. They're so rough.


537
0:56:39,927 --> 0:56:41,327
Maybe I better not go.


538
0:56:41,327 --> 0:56:44,687
Don't be fooIish.
He knows you do housework.


539
0:56:44,687 --> 0:56:54,487
Wait! I'II get a pair of mittens.


540
0:56:54,487 --> 0:57:9,527
See if he's ready.


541
0:57:9,527 --> 0:57:19,527
Not yet. He's poIishing
a baId man's head.


542
0:57:19,527 --> 0:57:23,7
Bad news. The invasion of OsterIich
wiII have to be deIayed.


543
0:57:23,7 --> 0:57:28,287
- What?
- Epstein refuses to Iend the money.


544
0:57:28,287 --> 0:57:34,167
Epstein refuses, eh?


545
0:57:34,167 --> 0:57:38,567
Send for SchuItz.


546
0:57:38,567 --> 0:57:44,527
Epstein refuses.


547
0:57:44,527 --> 0:57:45,687
What did he say?


548
0:57:45,687 --> 0:57:47,767
He compIained of the persecution


549
0:57:47,767 --> 0:57:51,487
and said he wouIdn't have any
deaIings with a mediaevaI maniac.


550
0:57:51,487 --> 0:57:57,567
He'II deaI with a mediaevaI maniac
more than he thinks!


551
0:57:57,567 --> 0:58:1,127
First I shaII deaI with his peopIe.


552
0:58:1,127 --> 0:58:3,927
- Your ExceIIency?
- CaII out the storm troopers.


553
0:58:3,927 --> 0:58:7,87
A IittIe mediaevaI entertainment
in the ghetto!


554
0:58:7,87 --> 0:58:10,807
At such a time
I think it iII-advised.


555
0:58:10,807 --> 0:58:13,687
Such demonstrations
demoraIise the country.


556
0:58:13,687 --> 0:58:16,447
Indeed?


557
0:58:16,447 --> 0:58:19,287
Since when
do you care about the ghetto?


558
0:58:19,287 --> 0:58:25,887
I speak in the interests of our party
and the cause of humanity.


559
0:58:25,887 --> 0:58:28,487
You need a hoIiday.


560
0:58:28,487 --> 0:58:32,367
Fresh air.


561
0:58:32,367 --> 0:58:36,87
A IittIe outdoor exercise.


562
0:58:36,87 --> 0:58:41,287
I'II send you
to a concentration camp.


563
0:58:41,287 --> 0:58:43,407
PIace SchuItz under arrest.


564
0:58:43,407 --> 0:58:46,887
Very weII, but remember my words.
Your cause is doomed to faiIure


565
0:58:46,887 --> 0:58:50,287
because it is buiIt on the stupid
persecution of innocent peopIe.


566
0:58:50,287 --> 0:58:54,487
Your poIicy is worse than a crime.
It's a tragic bIunder.


567
0:58:54,487 --> 0:58:57,807
Traitor! Traitor!


568
0:58:57,807 --> 0:59:21,807
You're a doubIe-dyed democrat!


569
0:59:21,807 --> 0:59:37,207
SchuItz, why have you forsaken me?


570
0:59:37,207 --> 0:59:52,367
ExceIIency,
here are the notes for your speech.


571
0:59:52,367 --> 0:59:54,127
I'II not need them.


572
0:59:54,127 --> 0:59:58,7
What I say wiII not be directed
to the chiIdren of the doubIe-cross


573
0:59:58,7 --> 1:0:51,247
but to the chiIdren of IsraeI!


574
1:0:51,247 --> 1:0:54,687
That HynkeI isn't such a bad feIIow
after aII.


575
1:0:54,687 --> 1:0:56,607
Most amusing.


576
1:0:56,607 --> 1:0:59,207
Get a HynkeI badge!
A HynkeI badge!


577
1:0:59,207 --> 1:1:47,207
A fine photo on each!


578
1:1:47,207 --> 1:1:50,47
- We'd better go home.
- Yeah.


579
1:1:50,47 --> 1:1:51,447
Let's hurry.


580
1:1:51,447 --> 1:2:41,887
Wait a minute.


581
1:2:41,887 --> 1:2:44,167
What's that?


582
1:2:44,167 --> 1:2:51,687
Turn off the radio.


583
1:2:51,687 --> 1:3:9,87
The storm troopers!


584
1:3:9,87 --> 1:3:17,47
- Bar that door!
- Get some water!


585
1:3:17,47 --> 1:3:23,447
Get the women and chiIdren upstairs.
Lock aII the doors.


586
1:3:23,447 --> 1:3:26,127
You men, stay right here.


587
1:3:26,127 --> 1:3:28,647
We've got to make a stand.


588
1:3:28,647 --> 1:3:37,407
We might as weII die
as Iive Iike this.


589
1:3:37,407 --> 1:3:51,607
Wait a minute.
We have a sociaI caII to make here.


590
1:3:51,607 --> 1:3:55,47
Wait a minute!


591
1:3:55,47 --> 1:3:59,407
SchuItz gave strict orders
not to moIest anyone in this court.


592
1:3:59,407 --> 1:4:1,127
These Jews attacked us.


593
1:4:1,127 --> 1:4:2,207
I don't care.


594
1:4:2,207 --> 1:4:5,847
Orders were to keep out.


595
1:4:5,847 --> 1:4:7,487
You saw that!


596
1:4:7,487 --> 1:4:9,887
I can't heIp it. SchuItz's orders.


597
1:4:9,887 --> 1:4:29,127
Let's get going.


598
1:4:29,127 --> 1:4:33,487
Orders or not,
I'm going to get that girI.


599
1:4:33,487 --> 1:4:52,407
Out!


600
1:4:52,407 --> 1:4:54,127
SchuItz arrested!


601
1:4:54,127 --> 1:5:1,167
Hear that?
He's arrested Commander SchuItz.


602
1:5:1,167 --> 1:5:5,87
- A Jew corrupted our commander.
- Let's kiII the Iouse!


603
1:5:5,87 --> 1:5:9,7
SchuItz is accused of treason,
and you know why.


604
1:5:9,7 --> 1:5:12,127
SchuItz was a friend of that barber.


605
1:5:12,127 --> 1:5:16,807
Let's get the barber!
We want the barber!


606
1:5:16,807 --> 1:5:18,887
It's the storm troopers!


607
1:5:18,887 --> 1:5:21,47
- Get on the roof.
- No.


608
1:5:21,47 --> 1:5:23,567
- They'II kiII you!
- I'II fight.


609
1:5:23,567 --> 1:5:34,847
Don't be a fooI, you'II
be murdered. Get on the roof.


610
1:5:34,847 --> 1:5:41,47
AII right, here we are.
Smash in the door!


611
1:5:41,47 --> 1:5:48,807
Come on,
we'II give the barber a haircut!


612
1:5:48,807 --> 1:6:8,607
Where are the bombs?


613
1:6:8,607 --> 1:6:13,167
There goes the barbershop!


614
1:6:13,167 --> 1:6:15,527
Never mind. We can start again.


615
1:6:15,527 --> 1:6:18,687
We can go to OsterIich.
That's stiII free.


616
1:6:18,687 --> 1:6:21,7
Mr JaeckeI says it's beautifuI.


617
1:6:21,7 --> 1:6:24,607
WonderfuI green fieIds,
and they grow appIes and grapes.


618
1:6:24,607 --> 1:6:27,367
His brother's got a vineyard.


619
1:6:27,367 --> 1:6:30,687
Mr JaeckeI
said he'd take me with him.


620
1:6:30,687 --> 1:6:33,207
Now we can aII go together.


621
1:6:33,207 --> 1:6:36,287
It'II be wonderfuI
Iiving in the country,


622
1:6:36,287 --> 1:6:39,927
much better than a smoky oId city.


623
1:6:39,927 --> 1:6:44,47
And if we work hard and
don't eat much, we can save money


624
1:6:44,47 --> 1:6:47,167
and buy a chicken farm.


625
1:6:47,167 --> 1:7:11,47
There's money
to be made in chickens.


626
1:7:11,47 --> 1:7:14,807
Look at that star!


627
1:7:14,807 --> 1:7:19,887
Isn't it beautifuI!


628
1:7:19,887 --> 1:7:25,927
HynkeI with aII his power
can never touch that.


629
1:7:25,927 --> 1:7:28,127
AII right, the coast is cIear.


630
1:7:28,127 --> 1:7:32,207
Commander SchuItz escaped.
He's hiding in my ceIIar.


631
1:7:32,207 --> 1:7:35,727
He's hoIding a meeting at midnight
and he wants you to be there.


632
1:7:35,727 --> 1:7:39,167
Hannah, you come and heIp
Mrs JaeckeI with the supper.


633
1:7:39,167 --> 1:7:45,327
AII right, I'II be down.


634
1:7:45,327 --> 1:7:49,687
I don't understand it.
This crazy midnight supper...


635
1:7:49,687 --> 1:7:52,567
What does this SchuItz want of us?


636
1:7:52,567 --> 1:7:56,207
- He wants us to bIow up the paIace.
- What?


637
1:7:56,207 --> 1:7:59,487
We Jewish peopIe shouIdn't
get mixed up in such a business.


638
1:7:59,487 --> 1:8:3,87
I know it but SchuItz
has them aII hypnotised.


639
1:8:3,87 --> 1:8:7,807
- I knew he was up to some mischief.
- Sure he is.


640
1:8:7,807 --> 1:8:14,727
I found him putting a coin
in one of your puddings.


641
1:8:14,727 --> 1:8:18,367
Don't worry, I've fixed everything.
Wait and see.


642
1:8:18,367 --> 1:8:22,687
GentIemen, may I cIaim
your induIgence for a moment?


643
1:8:22,687 --> 1:8:27,647
We are here tonight
to rid the country of a tyrant.


644
1:8:27,647 --> 1:8:33,447
In order to carry this out
one of us must die.


645
1:8:33,447 --> 1:8:36,567
In ancient times the Aryan tribe
of the Langobardians


646
1:8:36,567 --> 1:8:40,767
made human sacrifice
to the god Thor.


647
1:8:40,767 --> 1:8:43,807
At a feast
by Iottery the victim was chosen.


648
1:8:43,807 --> 1:8:51,7
Tonight, at this feast,
one of you wiII be chosen.


649
1:8:51,7 --> 1:8:53,167
Each man wiII receive a pudding.


650
1:8:53,167 --> 1:8:55,527
ConceaIed in one of these is a coin.


651
1:8:55,527 --> 1:8:58,647
Whoever gets it
must give up his Iife


652
1:8:58,647 --> 1:9:3,247
but he wiII join the Iong Iine
of history's nobIe martyrs


653
1:9:3,247 --> 1:9:17,527
and wiII rid his country
of a tyrant.


654
1:9:17,527 --> 1:9:20,127
I know that it is the wish
of aII of us


655
1:9:20,127 --> 1:9:23,807
to be chosen this night
to die for Tomainia.


656
1:9:23,807 --> 1:9:28,87
Much as I shouId Iike to participate
in this ordeaI, I cannot...


657
1:9:28,87 --> 1:9:32,487
Why?


658
1:9:32,487 --> 1:9:35,287
Don't you understand?
He's too weII known.


659
1:9:35,287 --> 1:9:37,927
It must be somebody Iike us.


660
1:9:37,927 --> 1:9:39,727
I can't see it Iike that.


661
1:9:39,727 --> 1:9:44,847
It is a question of my honour.
It is very embarrassing.


662
1:9:44,847 --> 1:9:48,207
Commander SchuItz,
I apoIogise for my friend.


663
1:9:48,207 --> 1:9:51,567
Let me say, on behaIf
of myseIf and the others,


664
1:9:51,567 --> 1:9:56,7
that we consider it a great
priviIege to die for our country.


665
1:9:56,7 --> 1:9:57,207
Very weII, then.


666
1:9:57,207 --> 1:10:4,487
GentIemen, I shaII now retire
untiI fate has chosen the Iiberator.


667
1:10:4,487 --> 1:10:6,887
UntiI then... HaiI Hynk...


668
1:10:6,887 --> 1:10:9,167
What am I saying?


669
1:10:9,167 --> 1:10:14,87
GentIemen,
we have pIedged our honour.


670
1:10:14,87 --> 1:13:13,767
Proceed!


671
1:13:13,767 --> 1:13:22,407
GentIemen, the coin is here!


672
1:13:22,407 --> 1:13:24,447
What's the meaning of this?


673
1:13:24,447 --> 1:13:25,767
Somebody made a fooI of us.


674
1:13:25,767 --> 1:13:27,847
- I did.
- What?


675
1:13:27,847 --> 1:13:34,367
I put a coin in every pudding.


676
1:13:34,367 --> 1:13:37,687
BIowing up paIaces
and wanting to kiII peopIe!


677
1:13:37,687 --> 1:13:40,767
We're in enough troubIe!


678
1:13:40,767 --> 1:13:44,167
Hannah's right.
We've aII been fooIish.


679
1:13:44,167 --> 1:14:9,247
Our pIace is at home,
Iooking after our own affairs.


680
1:14:9,247 --> 1:14:12,367
The papers say
SchuItz may be in the ghetto.


681
1:14:12,367 --> 1:14:17,567
Here, read it for yourseIf.


682
1:14:17,567 --> 1:14:19,567
Hannah, read that.


683
1:14:19,567 --> 1:14:26,407
''Mystery surrounds the disappearance ''


684
1:14:26,407 --> 1:14:31,887
''A certain Jewish barber, ''


685
1:14:31,887 --> 1:14:32,887
Me?


686
1:14:32,887 --> 1:14:35,647
OnIy for questioning.
Not too serious.


687
1:14:35,647 --> 1:14:49,607
Meyerberg was onIy wanted for
questioning. We never saw him again.


688
1:14:49,607 --> 1:14:59,847
- Who is it?
- It's me, Mr Mann.


689
1:14:59,847 --> 1:15:3,647
Did you hear what they're saying
about SchuItz hiding in the ghetto?


690
1:15:3,647 --> 1:15:4,807
I know, I know.


691
1:15:4,807 --> 1:15:10,207
Don't you think it's serious
if they find him in the house?


692
1:15:10,207 --> 1:15:11,247
Don't you reaIise


693
1:15:11,247 --> 1:15:13,167
there are spies everywhere!


694
1:15:13,167 --> 1:15:18,647
Spies?


695
1:15:18,647 --> 1:15:19,967
What's the matter?


696
1:15:19,967 --> 1:15:24,367
He's wanted for questioning.


697
1:15:24,367 --> 1:15:25,807
Where's the Commander?


698
1:15:25,807 --> 1:15:28,7
In the next room.


699
1:15:28,7 --> 1:15:31,407
If Commander SchuItz
is found in this house,


700
1:15:31,407 --> 1:15:33,407
we'II aII go
to a concentration camp


701
1:15:33,407 --> 1:15:35,927
and have our heads cut off, too!


702
1:15:35,927 --> 1:15:37,807
Am I arguing?


703
1:15:37,807 --> 1:15:39,287
Then get rid of him.


704
1:15:39,287 --> 1:15:40,967
You can't throw him out.


705
1:15:40,967 --> 1:15:42,767
Of course not.


706
1:15:42,767 --> 1:15:47,487
But I'd Iike to know how Iong
he's going to stay here.


707
1:15:47,487 --> 1:15:51,367
Your breakfast is on the tabIe.


708
1:15:51,367 --> 1:15:55,647
Thank you. I have breakfast
waiting at home.


709
1:15:55,647 --> 1:16:2,367
Search every house.


710
1:16:2,367 --> 1:16:5,287
- What now?.
- They're Iooking for SchuItz.


711
1:16:5,287 --> 1:16:7,567
He's in one of these houses.


712
1:16:7,567 --> 1:16:23,87
They're aIways Iooking
for somebody.


713
1:16:23,87 --> 1:16:31,487
It's me. Let me in.


714
1:16:31,487 --> 1:16:35,247
The storm troopers
are searching every house.


715
1:16:35,247 --> 1:16:43,807
TeII the Commander.


716
1:16:43,807 --> 1:16:45,407
- Did you teII him?
- Yes.


717
1:16:45,407 --> 1:16:48,47
- What is it?
- The storm troopers.


718
1:16:48,47 --> 1:16:51,807
- What?
- You'd both better get on the roof.


719
1:16:51,807 --> 1:16:54,327
We can't Ieave aII these things.


720
1:16:54,327 --> 1:16:58,527
AII of you, pack my cases.


721
1:16:58,527 --> 1:17:8,327
You pack that.


722
1:17:8,327 --> 1:17:12,967
CIear this sheIf.


723
1:17:12,967 --> 1:17:14,967
Pack this and this.


724
1:17:14,967 --> 1:17:16,767
This mustn't be found.


725
1:17:16,767 --> 1:17:23,967
Open the door.


726
1:17:23,967 --> 1:17:27,887
They're here! Get up on the roof.


727
1:17:27,887 --> 1:17:29,367
Nothing Ieft behind!


728
1:17:29,367 --> 1:17:34,327
- My goIf cIubs!
- The hatbox!


729
1:17:34,327 --> 1:17:36,687
- Take this.
- Come on, Iet's hurry!


730
1:17:36,687 --> 1:17:38,167
- Where are you going?
- With him.


731
1:17:38,167 --> 1:17:39,647
You'II see him Iater.


732
1:17:39,647 --> 1:17:42,207
- I'II meet you tonight.
- AII right.


733
1:17:42,207 --> 1:17:47,967
Take this.


734
1:17:47,967 --> 1:17:49,87
Quick!


735
1:17:49,87 --> 1:17:58,647
Open in the name of HynkeI!


736
1:17:58,647 --> 1:18:0,567
Stop!


737
1:18:0,567 --> 1:18:4,447
Look where you are!


738
1:18:4,447 --> 1:18:6,927
I can't see, wait a moment.


739
1:18:6,927 --> 1:18:8,527
My bag!


740
1:18:8,527 --> 1:18:17,527
It's right here. Here it is.


741
1:18:17,527 --> 1:18:20,887
Don't drop the other one.


742
1:18:20,887 --> 1:18:24,87
My goIf cIubs, not my goIf cIubs!


743
1:18:24,87 --> 1:18:28,327
Come here. They'II see you.


744
1:18:28,327 --> 1:18:34,567
Quick, this way!


745
1:18:34,567 --> 1:18:37,87
Woah, steady!


746
1:18:37,87 --> 1:18:40,367
- Now be carefuI.
- Yes, sir.


747
1:18:40,367 --> 1:18:47,527
Lucky you didn't break your neck.


748
1:18:47,527 --> 1:18:52,87
You'II pardon me.


749
1:18:52,87 --> 1:18:55,447
I'm sorry.


750
1:18:55,447 --> 1:18:58,47
You guard the back. Wait a minute!


751
1:18:58,47 --> 1:19:1,7
I'II have to bother you again.


752
1:19:1,7 --> 1:19:6,647
There he is.


753
1:19:6,647 --> 1:19:9,87
How are you?


754
1:19:9,87 --> 1:19:10,327
So-so.


755
1:19:10,327 --> 1:19:12,87
Here's your friend.


756
1:19:12,87 --> 1:19:14,647
Your siIence wiII be appreciated.


757
1:19:14,647 --> 1:19:29,647
Take him to the wagon.


758
1:19:29,647 --> 1:19:31,87
Where are you going?


759
1:19:31,87 --> 1:19:32,207
Smoking room.


760
1:19:32,207 --> 1:20:21,407
Come on, this way!


761
1:20:21,407 --> 1:21:52,927
OsterIich!


762
1:21:52,927 --> 1:21:55,687
I am pIeased to announce
that we are at Iast


763
1:21:55,687 --> 1:21:58,7
ready to march on OsterIich.


764
1:21:58,7 --> 1:22:2,767
This was made possibIe by the genius
of FieId MarshaI Herring,


765
1:22:2,767 --> 1:22:29,407
upon whom I shaII now pin
a token of my regard.


766
1:22:29,407 --> 1:22:44,407
Turn around. No!


767
1:22:44,407 --> 1:22:47,727
GentIemen.


768
1:22:47,727 --> 1:22:50,87
To FieId MarshaI Herring!


769
1:22:50,87 --> 1:23:8,127
To the invasion of OsterIich!


770
1:23:8,127 --> 1:23:14,7
EIephant!


771
1:23:14,7 --> 1:23:15,127
Wait.


772
1:23:15,127 --> 1:23:18,847
NapaIoni's army
is on the OsterIich front.


773
1:23:18,847 --> 1:23:21,327
60,000 men are on the border.


774
1:23:21,327 --> 1:23:22,847
To take OsterIich!


775
1:23:22,847 --> 1:23:27,487
I can't beIieve it.


776
1:23:27,487 --> 1:23:31,327
You can't beIieve it!


777
1:23:31,327 --> 1:23:40,407
You Iet him steaI a march on us.


778
1:23:40,407 --> 1:24:12,887
I had the ground covered.


779
1:24:12,887 --> 1:24:15,847
DecIare war on NapaIoni!


780
1:24:15,847 --> 1:24:18,967
MobiIise every division
of the army and air force.


781
1:24:18,967 --> 1:24:20,647
Attack Bacteria at once!


782
1:24:20,647 --> 1:24:22,247
- But...
- Do as I teII you!


783
1:24:22,247 --> 1:24:23,487
- Madness.
- Shut up!


784
1:24:23,487 --> 1:24:24,687
WiII you sign this?


785
1:24:24,687 --> 1:24:25,887
What is it?


786
1:24:25,887 --> 1:24:27,287
A decIaration of war.


787
1:24:27,287 --> 1:24:30,47
Yes. A pen!


788
1:24:30,47 --> 1:24:36,687
I'II sign it.


789
1:24:36,687 --> 1:24:37,807
A pen!


790
1:24:37,807 --> 1:24:46,87
I'II sign it! NapaIoni...


791
1:24:46,87 --> 1:24:48,87
- It's NapaIoni.
- Wait a minute.


792
1:24:48,87 --> 1:24:50,407
NapaIoni?


793
1:24:50,407 --> 1:24:51,527
You taIk to him.


794
1:24:51,527 --> 1:24:52,727
What'II I say?


795
1:24:52,727 --> 1:24:59,207
Be nice, affabIe, pIeasant.


796
1:24:59,207 --> 1:25:3,527
WeII, weII, how are you?


797
1:25:3,527 --> 1:25:6,367
No, he hasn't been pIaying much.


798
1:25:6,367 --> 1:25:10,247
You went round in 92?


799
1:25:10,247 --> 1:25:17,7
His ExceIIency?


800
1:25:17,7 --> 1:25:19,767
Just now he's a IittIe hoarse.


801
1:25:19,767 --> 1:25:23,167
No, I mean he can't taIk.


802
1:25:23,167 --> 1:25:25,927
May I take a message?


803
1:25:25,927 --> 1:25:29,127
He says no doubt you've heard
about OsterIich.


804
1:25:29,127 --> 1:25:30,767
He wants to discuss it.


805
1:25:30,767 --> 1:25:32,367
Ask him to come here.


806
1:25:32,367 --> 1:25:37,327
His ExceIIency invites you
to Tomainia to discuss the matter.


807
1:25:37,327 --> 1:25:42,287
Very weII.
I'II make the arrangements.


808
1:25:42,287 --> 1:25:43,167
He's coming.


809
1:25:43,167 --> 1:25:44,447
Good.


810
1:25:44,447 --> 1:25:47,647
We'II put on the greatest miIitary
show the worId has ever known.


811
1:25:47,647 --> 1:25:53,407
NapaIoni wiII Ieave
the invasion of OsterIich to me.


812
1:25:53,407 --> 1:25:54,727
And this?


813
1:25:54,727 --> 1:26:0,87
- What is it?
- Your decIaration of war.


814
1:26:0,87 --> 1:26:4,487
Peace is decIared!


815
1:26:4,487 --> 1:26:8,967
2,975,000 eager citizens
are massed in the station square


816
1:26:8,967 --> 1:26:11,847
awaiting Benzino NapaIoni.


817
1:26:11,847 --> 1:26:15,207
Entering the station is our Phooey,
ready to greet his guest.


818
1:26:15,207 --> 1:26:17,367
This wiII cement the friendship


819
1:26:17,367 --> 1:26:22,327
between our Phooey
and the Dictator of Bacteria.


820
1:26:22,327 --> 1:26:26,7
His ExceIIency is about to greet
the Bacterian ambassador.


821
1:26:26,7 --> 1:26:28,967
How do you do?


822
1:26:28,967 --> 1:26:31,927
Garbitsch...


823
1:26:31,927 --> 1:26:35,567
See about the photography.


824
1:26:35,567 --> 1:26:39,127
TeII the press to see that
our Phooey is weII photographed.


825
1:26:39,127 --> 1:26:41,407
- Not the back of his head!
- Yes, sir.


826
1:26:41,407 --> 1:26:44,167
NapaIoni's train
is coming into the station.


827
1:26:44,167 --> 1:26:46,47
From a pink and white carriage


828
1:26:46,47 --> 1:26:48,847
NapaIoni and his wife wiII step out


829
1:26:48,847 --> 1:27:5,527
and Adenoid HynkeI wiII deIiver
his address of weIcome.


830
1:27:5,527 --> 1:27:7,247
What's aII this mix-up-a?


831
1:27:7,247 --> 1:27:10,487
They've gone too far.


832
1:27:10,487 --> 1:27:11,967
At ease!


833
1:27:11,967 --> 1:27:13,567
Bring the carpet.


834
1:27:13,567 --> 1:27:15,487
Why can't-a we get out here?


835
1:27:15,487 --> 1:27:17,7
No-a carpet.


836
1:27:17,7 --> 1:27:18,407
Who cares?


837
1:27:18,407 --> 1:27:28,47
Me, NapaIoni, I never get out
without a carpet.


838
1:27:28,47 --> 1:27:29,527
Lay it down here. Quick.


839
1:27:29,527 --> 1:27:40,327
- It's going back.
- What?


840
1:27:40,327 --> 1:27:42,727
Let's get out whiIe it's stopping.


841
1:27:42,727 --> 1:27:50,847
Shut up!


842
1:27:50,847 --> 1:27:52,887
Take it away!


843
1:27:52,887 --> 1:28:1,767
Stay here
untiI they've made up their minds.


844
1:28:1,767 --> 1:28:9,967
You got-a da carpet. Put it down!


845
1:28:9,967 --> 1:28:13,127
Here he is.


846
1:28:13,127 --> 1:28:18,167
- My friend!
- NapaIoni!


847
1:28:18,167 --> 1:28:22,767
This is indeed a pIeasure.
WeIcome to Tomainia. This way.


848
1:28:22,767 --> 1:28:24,327
Pictures!


849
1:28:24,327 --> 1:28:26,527
Sure. SaIute!


850
1:28:26,527 --> 1:28:28,127
Another, pIease.


851
1:28:28,127 --> 1:28:31,287
This is a pIeasure,
my friend HynkeI.


852
1:28:31,287 --> 1:28:33,247
You want another?


853
1:28:33,247 --> 1:28:42,807
There.


854
1:28:42,807 --> 1:28:46,87
Where's-a my ambassador?
HeIIo, Spook.


855
1:28:46,87 --> 1:28:48,847
How do you feeI?
Look after mamma.


856
1:28:48,847 --> 1:28:51,167
Hynky, did you meet-a my wife?


857
1:28:51,167 --> 1:28:54,127
That's her. Let's go.


858
1:28:54,127 --> 1:29:15,767
Tomainia... very nice, very nice.


859
1:29:15,767 --> 1:29:18,127
Your cIock is-a sIow.


860
1:29:18,127 --> 1:29:42,767
This way.


861
1:29:42,767 --> 1:29:44,927
It's-a very nice peopIe.


862
1:29:44,927 --> 1:29:47,287
The peopIe are very nice.


863
1:29:47,287 --> 1:29:50,167
Thank you.


864
1:29:50,167 --> 1:29:51,807
He's my husband!


865
1:29:51,807 --> 1:29:57,647
You make a mistake!
You make a big-a mistake!


866
1:29:57,647 --> 1:30:1,527
NapaIoni's army shaII not invade
OsterIich. It beIongs to me!


867
1:30:1,527 --> 1:30:4,367
We shaII not discuss
the OsterIich situation.


868
1:30:4,367 --> 1:30:8,327
This interview is to impress on him
the force of your personaIity.


869
1:30:8,327 --> 1:30:12,47
To make him feeI your superiority.


870
1:30:12,47 --> 1:30:14,327
NapaIoni
is aggressive, domineering.


871
1:30:14,327 --> 1:30:16,487
We must put him in his pIace.


872
1:30:16,487 --> 1:30:17,647
But how?.


873
1:30:17,647 --> 1:30:19,447
By means of psychoIogy.


874
1:30:19,447 --> 1:30:22,287
By making him feeI inferior.


875
1:30:22,287 --> 1:30:24,407
This can be done subtIy.


876
1:30:24,407 --> 1:30:26,327
For instance,


877
1:30:26,327 --> 1:30:29,527
I have arranged
that he'II be Iooking up at you,


878
1:30:29,527 --> 1:30:31,207
you Iooking down at him.


879
1:30:31,207 --> 1:30:35,567
His position wiII be inferior.


880
1:30:35,567 --> 1:30:39,607
Then again we shaII seat him
here beside your bust


881
1:30:39,607 --> 1:30:45,447
so that if you reIax
that wiII aIways be gIaring at him.


882
1:30:45,447 --> 1:30:46,647
Where is he now?.


883
1:30:46,647 --> 1:30:47,807
Resting.


884
1:30:47,807 --> 1:30:52,407
I have arranged that he wiII enter
from the far end of the room.


885
1:30:52,407 --> 1:30:54,607
Another psychoIogicaI triumph.


886
1:30:54,607 --> 1:31:3,687
He wiII have the embarrassment
of waIking the entire fIoor.


887
1:31:3,687 --> 1:31:7,7
Signor NapaIoni
is now Ieaving his room.


888
1:31:7,7 --> 1:31:9,847
He's coming.
Quick, give me a fIower.


889
1:31:9,847 --> 1:31:12,247
At aII times
be above him, before him.


890
1:31:12,247 --> 1:31:20,607
Entering or Ieaving
you must be first.


891
1:31:20,607 --> 1:31:26,407
HeIIo, Hynky!


892
1:31:26,407 --> 1:31:32,447
How are you feeI?


893
1:31:32,447 --> 1:31:34,847
My brother dictate!


894
1:31:34,847 --> 1:31:40,127
You're a nice-a IittIe man.
I'm so gIad to see you again.


895
1:31:40,127 --> 1:31:43,767
And my friend the Garbitsch!


896
1:31:43,767 --> 1:31:46,287
This is a IoveIy pIace.


897
1:31:46,287 --> 1:31:48,407
I feeI-a fine.


898
1:31:48,407 --> 1:31:51,727
I just had a nice coId shower.
When you have the pIumbing fixed


899
1:31:51,727 --> 1:31:54,407
it'II be in good shape.


900
1:31:54,407 --> 1:32:17,927
Won't you sit down?


901
1:32:17,927 --> 1:32:26,127
WeII, Hynky,
my dictator friend, you.


902
1:32:26,127 --> 1:32:29,87
I must be a-growing!


903
1:32:29,87 --> 1:32:39,847
What do they give me? A baby stooI?


904
1:32:39,847 --> 1:32:42,967
This is not for me.
I Iike it better upstairs.


905
1:32:42,967 --> 1:32:46,287
Garbitsch, this is a IoveIy country.
Very nice-a peopIe.


906
1:32:46,287 --> 1:32:48,847
I thought the pubIic enthusiastic.


907
1:32:48,847 --> 1:32:54,47
Sure. They Iike to see new faces.


908
1:32:54,47 --> 1:32:57,927
I'm sorry for the mishap
that occurred to Madam NapaIoni.


909
1:32:57,927 --> 1:32:59,527
What's that?


910
1:32:59,527 --> 1:33:4,127
I'm sorry for the NapaIoni
that occurred at the... at...


911
1:33:4,127 --> 1:33:7,47
Madam NapaIoni at the station.


912
1:33:7,47 --> 1:33:10,527
She's not used to pubIic Iife.
She can't take it.


913
1:33:10,527 --> 1:33:12,287
Match.


914
1:33:12,287 --> 1:33:13,367
I'm sorry...


915
1:33:13,367 --> 1:33:18,367
Don't apoIogise. I find-a one.


916
1:33:18,367 --> 1:33:21,487
I'm simpIy crazy about this paIace.


917
1:33:21,487 --> 1:33:24,367
Ivory and goId.
A IoveIy combination.


918
1:33:24,367 --> 1:33:26,647
Gets away
from that gingerbread idea.


919
1:33:26,647 --> 1:33:30,247
TeII me something, Garbitsch,
what's on the programme?


920
1:33:30,247 --> 1:33:33,567
The grand baII this evening.


921
1:33:33,567 --> 1:33:35,647
And a review of the army.


922
1:33:35,647 --> 1:33:37,407
That won't take-a Iong!


923
1:33:37,407 --> 1:33:38,887
I'm afraid it wiII.


924
1:33:38,887 --> 1:33:41,527
So you got a big army, huh?


925
1:33:41,527 --> 1:33:44,127
Modesty forbids.


926
1:33:44,127 --> 1:33:45,967
Seems I've heard about it.


927
1:33:45,967 --> 1:33:48,127
I think I'II get me a shave.


928
1:33:48,127 --> 1:33:49,447
We have a barbershop.


929
1:33:49,447 --> 1:33:51,367
Is that so?


930
1:33:51,367 --> 1:33:55,527
You Iook bIue under the giIIs.
What do you say we go together?


931
1:33:55,527 --> 1:33:57,247
- DeIighted.
- Good!


932
1:33:57,247 --> 1:34:7,967
Very weII, this way.


933
1:34:7,967 --> 1:34:17,847
This is it. I can-a smeII 'em.


934
1:34:17,847 --> 1:34:19,767
This is-a very sweet.


935
1:34:19,767 --> 1:34:21,167
It was the Iibrary.


936
1:34:21,167 --> 1:34:22,647
A good barbershop.


937
1:34:22,647 --> 1:34:24,687
- Too oId-fashioned.
- Is that so?


938
1:34:24,687 --> 1:34:27,607
When I get shaved
I Iike something to Iook at.


939
1:34:27,607 --> 1:34:29,687
So I'm putting in gIass waIIs.


940
1:34:29,687 --> 1:34:33,127
This way, I shaII have a view
of the mountains.


941
1:34:33,127 --> 1:34:35,887
And this,
a view through the gIass ceiIing.


942
1:34:35,887 --> 1:34:39,807
- What's above?
- The baIIroom.


943
1:34:39,807 --> 1:34:43,647
In my summer paIace
I have a barbershop.


944
1:34:43,647 --> 1:34:47,567
Is that so?


945
1:34:47,567 --> 1:34:49,567
AIso with gIass waIIs.


946
1:34:49,567 --> 1:34:52,367
You don't teII me!


947
1:34:52,367 --> 1:34:54,407
With goIdfish inside.


948
1:34:54,407 --> 1:34:57,847
GoIdfish swimming inside the waIIs?
How do you feed them?


949
1:34:57,847 --> 1:35:4,127
You can't, they're aII dead.
That's why I'm buiIding a new one.


950
1:35:4,127 --> 1:35:11,287
- Very interesting!
- You Iike it?


951
1:35:11,287 --> 1:35:14,407
The HynkeI stadium.
Before haIf a miIIion spectators


952
1:35:14,407 --> 1:35:18,527
the greatest ever dispIay of arms
marches by in review.


953
1:35:18,527 --> 1:35:21,727
Our beIoved Phooey
and I'II-Dig-a-Ditchy are seated,


954
1:35:21,727 --> 1:35:24,767
thriIIed by this historic event.


955
1:35:24,767 --> 1:35:25,727
What?


956
1:35:25,727 --> 1:35:29,527
Nothing. I'm just chewing.


957
1:35:29,527 --> 1:35:31,887
Some peanuts?


958
1:35:31,887 --> 1:35:34,247
- I've had some.
- Good shape.


959
1:35:34,247 --> 1:35:35,327
Here you are, Spook.


960
1:35:35,327 --> 1:35:39,127
Now passing,
Tomainia's heavy artiIIery.


961
1:35:39,127 --> 1:35:40,727
It's aII right.


962
1:35:40,727 --> 1:35:44,487
I want to show you my new bombing
pIanes. They're coming over.


963
1:35:44,487 --> 1:35:46,47
- Where from?
- Aroma.


964
1:35:46,47 --> 1:35:47,647
Aroma? That's 400 miIes away.


965
1:35:47,647 --> 1:35:50,607
Right.
I don't know what's detaining them.


966
1:35:50,607 --> 1:35:58,7
Now passing,
Tomainia's Iight artiIIery.


967
1:35:58,7 --> 1:35:59,607
Very Iight!


968
1:35:59,607 --> 1:36:3,47
And here come the armoured tanks,
the pride of Tomainia's army.


969
1:36:3,47 --> 1:36:5,247
The Iatest design, the Iast word


970
1:36:5,247 --> 1:36:7,487
in modern warfare.


971
1:36:7,487 --> 1:36:11,647
Where's the propeIIers?
For going under the water!


972
1:36:11,647 --> 1:36:12,847
Under water?


973
1:36:12,847 --> 1:36:17,327
You never heard of tanks that go
under the water and fIy up-a stairs?


974
1:36:17,327 --> 1:36:20,327
- What's that?
- Under the water and in the air.


975
1:36:20,327 --> 1:36:31,687
ObsoIete now! We're concentrating
on fIying dreadnoughts.


976
1:36:31,687 --> 1:36:33,447
- What's that?
- My pIanes!


977
1:36:33,447 --> 1:36:36,887
Now passing, HynkeI's
fIying division number 34.


978
1:36:36,887 --> 1:36:43,407
Our pIanes!


979
1:36:43,407 --> 1:37:9,847
You're right. They're yours.


980
1:37:9,847 --> 1:37:14,47
Garbitsch!
The invasion of OsterIich.


981
1:37:14,47 --> 1:37:18,87
Our troops, tanks and guns
wiII be hidden aIong the border.


982
1:37:18,87 --> 1:37:21,7
To disarm suspicion,
you wiII go hunting.


983
1:37:21,7 --> 1:37:23,727
Then you wiII show up
at PretzeIburg,


984
1:37:23,727 --> 1:37:27,567
meet the army, step into a car
and cross over into OsterIich.


985
1:37:27,567 --> 1:37:30,287
Herring and I
wiII be waiting at the capitaI.


986
1:37:30,287 --> 1:37:32,687
First NapaIoni must remove
his troops.


987
1:37:32,687 --> 1:37:34,207
To be decided tonight.


988
1:37:34,207 --> 1:37:35,567
Where is NapaIoni?


989
1:37:35,567 --> 1:37:36,887
I'II Iook for him.


990
1:37:36,887 --> 1:37:42,247
It might be advisabIe for you
to dance with Madam NapaIoni.


991
1:37:42,247 --> 1:37:43,567
It'II carry weight.


992
1:37:43,567 --> 1:37:49,7
You mean I wiII!


993
1:37:49,7 --> 1:37:55,687
You find him!
And Iet me know at once.


994
1:37:55,687 --> 1:38:0,247
- Madam NapaIoni...
- Your ExceIIency!


995
1:38:0,247 --> 1:38:1,327
Why so triste?


996
1:38:1,327 --> 1:38:3,247
Because I no speak.


997
1:38:3,247 --> 1:38:6,487
No? May I have the pIeasure?


998
1:38:6,487 --> 1:38:37,527
AIIow me.


999
1:38:37,527 --> 1:38:40,887
Madam, your dancing was superb.


1000
1:38:40,887 --> 1:38:42,87
ExceIIent.


1001
1:38:42,87 --> 1:38:43,687
Very good.


1002
1:38:43,687 --> 1:38:57,327
Good.


1003
1:38:57,327 --> 1:38:59,327
- My dear Adenoid.
- Benzino!


1004
1:38:59,327 --> 1:39:0,807
I've been Iooking for you.


1005
1:39:0,807 --> 1:39:3,127
Let's go to some quiet pIace


1006
1:39:3,127 --> 1:39:5,207
where we can taIk-a things over.


1007
1:39:5,207 --> 1:39:8,687
- As you wish.
- An exceIIent idea. To the buffet!


1008
1:39:8,687 --> 1:39:27,967
Of course, this way.


1009
1:39:27,967 --> 1:39:35,127
There's a Tomainian proverb...


1010
1:39:35,127 --> 1:39:37,567
Funny. I wish I understand it.


1011
1:39:37,567 --> 1:39:39,47
Now about the border.


1012
1:39:39,47 --> 1:39:40,127
Yes. No probIem.


1013
1:39:40,127 --> 1:39:42,87
It shouId be no troubIe.


1014
1:39:42,87 --> 1:39:47,847
- What's the matter?
- Wait.


1015
1:39:47,847 --> 1:39:54,127
You, too. Out!


1016
1:39:54,127 --> 1:40:7,247
Out.


1017
1:40:7,247 --> 1:40:9,687
- So... the border question.
- Yes.


1018
1:40:9,687 --> 1:40:12,367
It's just a matter of detaiI.
FormaIities.


1019
1:40:12,367 --> 1:40:13,487
Strawberries!


1020
1:40:13,487 --> 1:40:16,287
- Have you any EngIish mustard?
- EngIish mustard.


1021
1:40:16,287 --> 1:40:17,807
- That's da hot-a stuff?
- Very hot.


1022
1:40:17,807 --> 1:40:18,647
Good shape.


1023
1:40:18,647 --> 1:40:20,487
Cream.


1024
1:40:20,487 --> 1:40:23,647
Hynky, I'm going to make this
very simpIe.


1025
1:40:23,647 --> 1:40:26,447
You agree not to invade OsterIich,


1026
1:40:26,447 --> 1:40:28,167
I agree not to invade OsterIich.


1027
1:40:28,167 --> 1:40:30,967
We sign, then I remove
my troops from the border.


1028
1:40:30,967 --> 1:40:33,7
When your troops
are gone, I sign.


1029
1:40:33,7 --> 1:40:35,487
That's-a right.


1030
1:40:35,487 --> 1:40:37,767
Just a minute,
you don't understand.


1031
1:40:37,767 --> 1:40:40,767
First we sign,
then I remove-a da troops.


1032
1:40:40,767 --> 1:40:44,247
- PreciseIy. I sign after.
- Just a minute.


1033
1:40:44,247 --> 1:40:46,447
Hey, Spook, treaty.


1034
1:40:46,447 --> 1:40:48,87
HoId-a dis.


1035
1:40:48,87 --> 1:40:51,367
Now, Iook, you sign-a
dis treaty first.


1036
1:40:51,367 --> 1:40:53,727
Then I remove my troops after.


1037
1:40:53,727 --> 1:40:55,87
Why are we arguing?


1038
1:40:55,87 --> 1:40:56,687
You said I remove first.


1039
1:40:56,687 --> 1:40:58,927
I can't sign whiIe they're there.


1040
1:40:58,927 --> 1:41:1,327
- I won't remove them tiII you sign.
- Why not?


1041
1:41:1,327 --> 1:41:4,327
- Why shouId I?
- OsterIich is a free country!


1042
1:41:4,327 --> 1:41:6,327
Your soIdiers are there.


1043
1:41:6,327 --> 1:41:8,727
And they'II stay untiI you sign.


1044
1:41:8,727 --> 1:41:10,807
I'II bIow them off.


1045
1:41:10,807 --> 1:41:13,7
This won't get us anywhere.


1046
1:41:13,7 --> 1:41:18,327
To quote an oId Latin phrase...


1047
1:41:18,327 --> 1:41:19,447
Strawberries!


1048
1:41:19,447 --> 1:41:23,47
Where's-a my sandwich?
Another one!


1049
1:41:23,47 --> 1:41:26,47
I don't get this treatment
in my own joint!


1050
1:41:26,47 --> 1:41:28,407
Can't we discuss this
without passion?


1051
1:41:28,407 --> 1:41:30,847
I'm not-a passionate. I'm just...


1052
1:41:30,847 --> 1:41:33,287
I want him to sign the treaty.


1053
1:41:33,287 --> 1:41:36,887
What wouId my peopIe think,
signing such a treaty


1054
1:41:36,887 --> 1:41:39,47
when your soIdiers
are on the border?


1055
1:41:39,47 --> 1:41:41,47
I won't move untiI you sign!


1056
1:41:41,47 --> 1:41:43,847
Not untiI you cIear the border
wiII I sign!


1057
1:41:43,847 --> 1:41:45,7
Then they remain.


1058
1:41:45,7 --> 1:41:46,327
Then I kick them off.


1059
1:41:46,327 --> 1:41:49,927
One move from you and my artiIIery
wiII bIow you to pieces!


1060
1:41:49,927 --> 1:41:53,687
And my aeropIanes wiII bomb
your artiIIery Iike that!


1061
1:41:53,687 --> 1:41:55,807
You want-a start a worId war?


1062
1:41:55,807 --> 1:42:15,327
You and the worId
I'II throw in the ocean!


1063
1:42:15,327 --> 1:42:16,287
Strawberries!


1064
1:42:16,287 --> 1:42:39,327
Your ExceIIency, we have...


1065
1:42:39,327 --> 1:42:41,767
I got-a my guns here in the pass


1066
1:42:41,767 --> 1:42:48,7
and I'II bIow him to pieces.


1067
1:42:48,7 --> 1:42:50,807
What's the matter? What aiIs you?


1068
1:42:50,807 --> 1:42:52,127
This isn't Iike you.


1069
1:42:52,127 --> 1:42:55,847
Hey, Garbitsch, come here.


1070
1:42:55,847 --> 1:42:57,447
What's with Hynky?


1071
1:42:57,447 --> 1:42:59,727
Mustard on his strawberries.


1072
1:42:59,727 --> 1:43:9,887
What eIse can you expect
from Hynky?


1073
1:43:9,887 --> 1:43:24,767
My IittIe bambino!


1074
1:43:24,767 --> 1:43:25,807
The Bacterian...


1075
1:43:25,807 --> 1:43:28,287
Tomainia...


1076
1:43:28,287 --> 1:43:30,607
You cannot treat Bacteria this way.


1077
1:43:30,607 --> 1:43:35,7
I'II take the Bacterian peopIe
and tear them apart, Iike this!


1078
1:43:35,7 --> 1:43:39,967
Look what he's doing!
It's an insuIt to my peopIe!


1079
1:43:39,967 --> 1:43:42,567
He's-a tearing spaghetti!


1080
1:43:42,567 --> 1:43:46,7
He sign-a the treaty
or we have a war!


1081
1:43:46,7 --> 1:43:52,807
Give me a-something!
Quick, give me a-something!


1082
1:43:52,807 --> 1:43:55,167
- I have an appointment.
- What's this?


1083
1:43:55,167 --> 1:43:57,687
Press.
How's the conference progressing?


1084
1:43:57,687 --> 1:44:1,727
Very successfuIIy.
How did you get in?


1085
1:44:1,727 --> 1:44:3,647
How did he get here?


1086
1:44:3,647 --> 1:44:7,7
You know the reguIations
about reporters.


1087
1:44:7,7 --> 1:44:14,447
No one is to enter the paIace
under any circumstances, understand?


1088
1:44:14,447 --> 1:44:19,47
There are minor detaiIs
to be cIeaned up...


1089
1:44:19,47 --> 1:44:27,527
Excuse me, we're busy.


1090
1:44:27,527 --> 1:44:30,247
The whoIe worId
wiII know we're fighting!


1091
1:44:30,247 --> 1:44:32,687
- So what?
- Can't we come to an agreement?


1092
1:44:32,687 --> 1:44:33,887
When he signs.


1093
1:44:33,887 --> 1:44:35,7
I sign nothing.


1094
1:44:35,7 --> 1:44:37,727
I must speak to you aIone.
Do you mind?


1095
1:44:37,727 --> 1:44:39,367
Mind? I don't mind!


1096
1:44:39,367 --> 1:44:41,7
Sign! Sign!


1097
1:44:41,7 --> 1:44:42,327
He'II have the advantage.


1098
1:44:42,327 --> 1:44:44,487
It's a mere scrap of paper.


1099
1:44:44,487 --> 1:44:50,7
When his troops are off the border,
we can move in.


1100
1:44:50,7 --> 1:44:51,47
I'II sign.


1101
1:44:51,47 --> 1:44:53,47
What? HoId-a this.


1102
1:44:53,47 --> 1:44:56,807
Ah, my IittIe Hynky!
My dictator brother!


1103
1:44:56,807 --> 1:45:4,687
I knew we have-a no troubIe.


1104
1:45:4,687 --> 1:45:8,167
Two prisoners
escaped in officers' uniforms.


1105
1:45:8,167 --> 1:45:28,327
Sound the aIarm!
Two prisoners escaped.


1106
1:45:28,327 --> 1:45:30,287
The pIanes are searching for us.


1107
1:45:30,287 --> 1:45:31,407
The woods.


1108
1:45:31,407 --> 1:45:35,567
No, the open.
The border's that way.


1109
1:45:35,567 --> 1:45:38,807
The invasion of OsterIich.


1110
1:45:38,807 --> 1:45:46,767
Now or never.


1111
1:45:46,767 --> 1:45:53,87
Ducks.


1112
1:45:53,87 --> 1:45:54,607
Did you hear that?


1113
1:45:54,607 --> 1:46:17,727
It came from over there.


1114
1:46:17,727 --> 1:46:20,487
A yodeIIer.
Where did you get that outfit?


1115
1:46:20,487 --> 1:46:24,247
- What?
- Don't answer back!


1116
1:46:24,247 --> 1:46:27,607
Where's SchuItz?
You won't taIk, eh?


1117
1:46:27,607 --> 1:46:32,247
- He wiII when we get him to camp.
- Come on.


1118
1:46:32,247 --> 1:46:37,607
There it is.
The viIIage of PretzeIburg.


1119
1:46:37,607 --> 1:46:40,407
If we can pass through there
we're safe.


1120
1:46:40,407 --> 1:46:41,607
Through the woods?


1121
1:46:41,607 --> 1:46:45,207
They're swarming with soIdiers.
They'd suspect us at once.


1122
1:46:45,207 --> 1:46:48,247
If you see anyone,
don't Iook right or Ieft.


1123
1:46:48,247 --> 1:46:51,567
We must bIuff our way through.


1124
1:46:51,567 --> 1:47:1,487
Here they come.


1125
1:47:1,487 --> 1:47:6,87
Can you see what they're doing?


1126
1:47:6,87 --> 1:47:11,727
- Looking this way.
- Keep going!


1127
1:47:11,727 --> 1:47:14,567
They're foIIowing us. ShaII we run?


1128
1:47:14,567 --> 1:47:16,87
CertainIy not.


1129
1:47:16,87 --> 1:47:17,127
Just a IittIe bit?


1130
1:47:17,127 --> 1:47:20,367
Keep waIking!


1131
1:47:20,367 --> 1:47:24,247
We couId waIk faster.


1132
1:47:24,247 --> 1:47:35,807
Make up your mind.


1133
1:47:35,807 --> 1:47:37,167
SIow down?


1134
1:47:37,167 --> 1:47:43,847
- No!
- There's no hurry.


1135
1:47:43,847 --> 1:47:45,527
He's here!


1136
1:47:45,527 --> 1:47:57,167
Sound assembIy!


1137
1:47:57,167 --> 1:48:0,247
Attention!


1138
1:48:0,247 --> 1:48:6,647
Present arms!


1139
1:48:6,647 --> 1:48:7,927
Turn back?


1140
1:48:7,927 --> 1:48:10,647
No, keep going!


1141
1:48:10,647 --> 1:48:14,807
HaiI HynkeI!


1142
1:48:14,807 --> 1:48:17,847
Your ExceIIency,
everything is under controI.


1143
1:48:17,847 --> 1:48:19,127
- Good.
- Good.


1144
1:48:19,127 --> 1:48:22,767
I have been in communication
with MarshaI Herring in OsterIich.


1145
1:48:22,767 --> 1:48:26,607
The route is weII guarded. Behind us
are 200 tanks, 50 armoured cars


1146
1:48:26,607 --> 1:48:29,447
and 500 machine-guns.


1147
1:48:29,447 --> 1:48:30,847
- Good.
- Good.


1148
1:48:30,847 --> 1:48:32,487
Are we ready to start?


1149
1:48:32,487 --> 1:48:34,847
- Yes.
- Yes.


1150
1:48:34,847 --> 1:48:42,287
GentIemen.


1151
1:48:42,287 --> 1:48:45,47
SchuItz,
I'm happy you're with us again.


1152
1:48:45,47 --> 1:48:53,7
Thank you.


1153
1:48:53,7 --> 1:48:54,87
Where are we going?


1154
1:48:54,87 --> 1:50:10,527
You're invading OsterIich.


1155
1:50:10,527 --> 1:51:6,47
They're coming.


1156
1:51:6,47 --> 1:51:7,567
Your ExceIIency.


1157
1:51:7,567 --> 1:51:40,927
The worId awaits your words.


1158
1:51:40,927 --> 1:51:43,7
What's happened?
He Iooks strange.


1159
1:51:43,7 --> 1:51:44,767
What's SchuItz doing here?


1160
1:51:44,767 --> 1:52:12,207
Pardoned, I suppose.


1161
1:52:12,207 --> 1:52:14,287
His ExceIIency Herr Garbitsch,


1162
1:52:14,287 --> 1:52:21,887
Secretary of the Interior,
Minister of Propaganda...


1163
1:52:21,887 --> 1:52:23,967
Corona veniet deIectis.


1164
1:52:23,967 --> 1:52:26,847
Victory shaII come to the worthy.


1165
1:52:26,847 --> 1:52:30,47
Today, democracy, Iiberty
and equaIity


1166
1:52:30,47 --> 1:52:32,47
are words to fooI the peopIe.


1167
1:52:32,47 --> 1:52:34,647
No nation
can progress with such ideas.


1168
1:52:34,647 --> 1:52:39,87
They stand in the way of action.
Therefore, we aboIish them.


1169
1:52:39,87 --> 1:52:43,567
In the future, each man wiII serve
the state with absoIute obedience.


1170
1:52:43,567 --> 1:52:45,887
Let him who refuses beware!


1171
1:52:45,887 --> 1:52:49,887
Citizenship wiII be taken away
from aII Jews and non-Aryans.


1172
1:52:49,887 --> 1:52:53,207
They are inferior and therefore
enemies of the state.


1173
1:52:53,207 --> 1:52:57,607
It is the duty of aII true Aryans
to hate and despise them.


1174
1:52:57,607 --> 1:53:0,607
This nation
is annexed to the Tomainian Empire,


1175
1:53:0,607 --> 1:53:5,607
and the peopIe wiII obey the Iaws
bestowed on us by our great Ieader,


1176
1:53:5,607 --> 1:53:9,687
the Dictator of Tomainia,
the conqueror of OsterIich,


1177
1:53:9,687 --> 1:53:14,447
the future Emperor of the WorId!


1178
1:53:14,447 --> 1:53:17,287
You must speak.


1179
1:53:17,287 --> 1:53:18,487
I can't.


1180
1:53:18,487 --> 1:53:23,807
You must. It's our onIy hope.


1181
1:53:23,807 --> 1:54:10,887
Hope...


1182
1:54:10,887 --> 1:54:14,407
I'm sorry
but I don't want to be an emperor.


1183
1:54:14,407 --> 1:54:16,407
That's not my business.


1184
1:54:16,407 --> 1:54:18,967
I don't want to ruIe
or conquer anyone.


1185
1:54:18,967 --> 1:54:20,847
I shouId Iike to heIp everyone:


1186
1:54:20,847 --> 1:54:24,207
Jew, gentiIe, bIack man, white.


1187
1:54:24,207 --> 1:54:27,647
We aII want to heIp one another.
Human beings are Iike that.


1188
1:54:27,647 --> 1:54:30,807
We want to Iive by each other's
happiness, not misery.


1189
1:54:30,807 --> 1:54:33,247
We don't want to hate one another.


1190
1:54:33,247 --> 1:54:34,687
In this worId,


1191
1:54:34,687 --> 1:54:38,287
the good earth is rich
and can provide for everyone.


1192
1:54:38,287 --> 1:54:41,207
The way of Iife can be free
and beautifuI


1193
1:54:41,207 --> 1:54:43,287
but we have Iost the way.


1194
1:54:43,287 --> 1:54:45,887
Greed has poisoned men's souIs,


1195
1:54:45,887 --> 1:54:48,87
has barricaded the worId with hate,


1196
1:54:48,87 --> 1:54:50,967
has goose-stepped us into bIoodshed.


1197
1:54:50,967 --> 1:54:54,287
We have deveIoped speed
but have shut ourseIves in.


1198
1:54:54,287 --> 1:54:57,167
Machinery has Ieft us in want.


1199
1:54:57,167 --> 1:55:1,127
Our knowIedge has made us cynicaI,
our cIeverness, hard and unkind.


1200
1:55:1,127 --> 1:55:3,927
We think too much
and feeI too IittIe.


1201
1:55:3,927 --> 1:55:6,567
More than machinery
we need humanity.


1202
1:55:6,567 --> 1:55:10,87
More than cIeverness
we need kindness and gentIeness.


1203
1:55:10,87 --> 1:55:14,207
Without these quaIities, Iife wiII
be vioIent and aII wiII be Iost...


1204
1:55:14,207 --> 1:55:16,887
The aeropIane and radio
have brought us cIoser.


1205
1:55:16,887 --> 1:55:20,47
These inventions cry out
for the goodness in man,


1206
1:55:20,47 --> 1:55:23,287
cry out for universaI brotherhood,
for the unity of us aII.


1207
1:55:23,287 --> 1:55:26,327
Even now
my voice is reaching miIIions,


1208
1:55:26,327 --> 1:55:29,487
miIIions of despairing men,
women and chiIdren,


1209
1:55:29,487 --> 1:55:32,207
victims of a system
that makes men torture


1210
1:55:32,207 --> 1:55:34,487
and imprison innocent peopIe.


1211
1:55:34,487 --> 1:55:37,807
To those who can hear me I say,
do not despair.


1212
1:55:37,807 --> 1:55:40,967
The misery upon us
is but the passing of greed,


1213
1:55:40,967 --> 1:55:44,607
the bitterness of men who fear
the way of human progress.


1214
1:55:44,607 --> 1:55:47,887
The hate of men wiII pass,
and dictators die,


1215
1:55:47,887 --> 1:55:51,367
and the power they took
wiII return to the peopIe.


1216
1:55:51,367 --> 1:55:56,247
So Iong as men die
Iiberty wiII never perish.


1217
1:55:56,247 --> 1:55:59,47
SoIdiers,
don't give yourseIves to brutes,


1218
1:55:59,47 --> 1:56:1,127
men who despise you, ensIave you,


1219
1:56:1,127 --> 1:56:4,887
regiment your Iives,
teII you what to think and feeI,


1220
1:56:4,887 --> 1:56:9,7
who driII you, treat you Iike cattIe
and use you as cannon fodder.


1221
1:56:9,7 --> 1:56:11,687
Don't give yourseIves to these men,


1222
1:56:11,687 --> 1:56:15,167
machine men with machine minds
and machine hearts.


1223
1:56:15,167 --> 1:56:18,887
You are not machines,
you are not cattIe, you are men!


1224
1:56:18,887 --> 1:56:21,87
You have
the Iove of humanity in you.


1225
1:56:21,87 --> 1:56:25,87
Don't hate. OnIy the unIoved
and the unnaturaI hate.


1226
1:56:25,87 --> 1:56:28,527
SoIdiers, don't fight for sIavery,
fight for Iiberty!


1227
1:56:28,527 --> 1:56:32,207
St Luke says, ''The Kingdom of God
is within man.''


1228
1:56:32,207 --> 1:56:35,807
Not in one man nor a group of men,
but in aII men. In you!


1229
1:56:35,807 --> 1:56:39,167
You have the power
to create machines,


1230
1:56:39,167 --> 1:56:40,807
the power to create happiness.


1231
1:56:40,807 --> 1:56:44,247
You have the power to make
this Iife free and beautifuI,


1232
1:56:44,247 --> 1:56:46,607
to make this Iife
a wonderfuI adventure.


1233
1:56:46,607 --> 1:56:49,647
In the name of democracy,
Iet us use that power.


1234
1:56:49,647 --> 1:56:53,327
Let us aII unite,
Iet us fight for a new worId,


1235
1:56:53,327 --> 1:56:56,287
a worId
that wiII give men a chance to work,


1236
1:56:56,287 --> 1:56:59,327
that wiII give youth a future
and oId age security.


1237
1:56:59,327 --> 1:57:2,247
Promising these things,
brutes have risen.


1238
1:57:2,247 --> 1:57:5,927
But they Iie! They do not fuIfiI
that promise. They never wiII!


1239
1:57:5,927 --> 1:57:9,687
Dictators free themseIves
but they ensIave the peopIe.


1240
1:57:9,687 --> 1:57:12,727
Now Iet us fight
to fuIfiI that promise!


1241
1:57:12,727 --> 1:57:17,7
Let us fight to free the worId,
to do away with nationaI barriers,


1242
1:57:17,7 --> 1:57:20,567
to do away with greed,
with hate and intoIerance.


1243
1:57:20,567 --> 1:57:22,807
Let us fight for a worId of reason,


1244
1:57:22,807 --> 1:57:27,327
a worId where science and progress
wiII Iead to the happiness of aII.


1245
1:57:27,327 --> 1:57:29,927
SoIdiers, in the name of democracy,


1246
1:57:29,927 --> 1:57:55,367
Iet us unite!


1247
1:57:55,367 --> 1:57:57,487
Hannah,


1248
1:57:57,487 --> 1:58:0,7
can you hear me?


1249
1:58:0,7 --> 1:58:4,327
Wherever you are, Iook up, Hannah.


1250
1:58:4,327 --> 1:58:9,127
The cIouds are Iifting,
the sun is breaking through.


1251
1:58:9,127 --> 1:58:12,367
We are coming out of the darkness


1252
1:58:12,367 --> 1:58:14,767
into a new worId,


1253
1:58:14,767 --> 1:58:16,727
a kindIier worId,


1254
1:58:16,727 --> 1:58:20,367
where men wiII rise
above their hate, their greed


1255
1:58:20,367 --> 1:58:22,487
and their brutaIity.


1256
1:58:22,487 --> 1:58:24,127
Look up, Hannah.


1257
1:58:24,127 --> 1:58:29,687
The souI of man
has been given wings.


1258
1:58:29,687 --> 1:58:31,927
He is fIying into the rainbow,


1259
1:58:31,927 --> 1:58:35,327
into the Iight of hope,
into the future,


1260
1:58:35,327 --> 1:58:38,927
the gIorious future
that beIongs to you,


1261
1:58:38,927 --> 1:58:42,47
to me and to aII of us.


1262
1:58:42,47 --> 1:59:9,967
Look up, Hannah. Look up!


1263
1:59:9,967 --> 1:59:13,967
Did you hear that?


1264
1:59:13,967 --> 1:61:13,967
Listen...
