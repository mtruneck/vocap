1
0:0:1,267 --> 0:0:2,535
TRAVIS:
Now on Rocket City Rednecks...


2
0:0:2,535 --> 0:0:3,769
ROG: Three, two, one.


3
0:0:3,769 --> 0:0:7,406
TRAVIS: We build
a one-man flying machine.


4
0:0:7,406 --> 0:0:9,842
But, since I'm off at
a sci-fi convention,


5
0:0:9,842 --> 0:0:12,478
can the guys get airborne?


6
0:0:12,478 --> 0:0:17,316
Or are they facing
a Hillbilly Hindenburg?


7
0:0:17,316 --> 0:0:19,85
ROG: Oh, the humanity!


8
0:0:19,85 --> 0:0:20,553
TRAVIS: I'm Travis Taylor.


9
0:0:20,553 --> 0:0:22,621
I'm a rocket scientist in
the space and defense industry


10
0:0:22,621 --> 0:0:25,357
here in my hometown of
Huntsville, Alabama,


11
0:0:25,357 --> 0:0:27,93
where my daddy helped
build the rockets


12
0:0:27,93 --> 0:0:28,727
that sent us to the moon.


13
0:0:28,727 --> 0:0:31,397
DADDY: Have y'all been drinking
the rocket fuel again?


14
0:0:31,397 --> 0:0:34,133
TRAVIS: Sometimes, big science
moves too slow for me.


15
0:0:34,133 --> 0:0:37,236
So come the weekend,
I round up my best friend Rog...


16
0:0:37,236 --> 0:0:38,471
ROG: Hey!


17
0:0:38,471 --> 0:0:40,573
TRAVIS: ...my nephew Michael
and my buddy Pete


18
0:0:40,573 --> 0:0:42,108
to tackle important problems


19
0:0:42,108 --> 0:0:45,211
with a little
down-home ingenuity.


20
0:0:45,211 --> 0:0:49,849
ROG: Damn it, boy!


21
0:0:49,849 --> 0:0:51,16
TRAVIS: Right on.


22
0:0:51,16 --> 0:0:54,286
Hey, is there any more beers
in the cooler?


23
0:0:54,286 --> 0:0:56,589
Human beings have always
wanted to fly.


24
0:0:56,589 --> 0:0:59,191
From Leonardo Da Vinci
to the Wright brothers.


25
0:0:59,191 --> 0:1:1,994
So this weekend, I wanted us
to fulfill the dream


26
0:1:1,994 --> 0:1:5,297
by creating
a one-man flying machine.


27
0:1:5,297 --> 0:1:7,967
In fact, the US military
has been trying to create


28
0:1:7,967 --> 0:1:12,671
a personal aerial device
since the 1950s.


29
0:1:12,671 --> 0:1:15,274
Ours has got to be small,
portable,


30
0:1:15,274 --> 0:1:19,512
and able to soar into the sky
without killing the pilot.


31
0:1:19,512 --> 0:1:22,815
The only problem is
I've got a scheduling conflict.


32
0:1:22,815 --> 0:1:25,151
The guys are gonna have to wait
until I get back this afternoon


33
0:1:25,151 --> 0:1:27,186
before they get started.


34
0:1:27,186 --> 0:1:29,155
DADDY: Y'all doing good
cleaning up, huh?


35
0:1:29,155 --> 0:1:30,456
ROG: Where's Travis at


36
0:1:30,456 --> 0:1:33,492
when we all cleaning up
his ideas and crap over here?


37
0:1:33,492 --> 0:1:35,227
DADDY: Well, you're doing
a good job of cleaning up,


38
0:1:35,227 --> 0:1:38,697
but he's at the science fiction
convention is where he's gone.


39
0:1:38,697 --> 0:1:40,499
TRAVIS: I'm a huge fan
of science fiction


40
0:1:40,499 --> 0:1:42,34
and a science fiction author.


41
0:1:42,34 --> 0:1:43,969
This weekend I'm at
a science fiction convention


42
0:1:43,969 --> 0:1:46,205
talking about my writing.


43
0:1:46,205 --> 0:1:49,74
What I like to see, what
I usually do with my characters


44
0:1:49,74 --> 0:1:50,809
is they get what's
coming to 'em,


45
0:1:50,809 --> 0:1:52,678
and then we blow 'em up
some more.


46
0:1:52,678 --> 0:1:54,28
[laughter]


47
0:1:54,28 --> 0:1:58,417
It's a lot of fun, and you never
know what you're gonna see next.


48
0:1:58,417 --> 0:1:59,985
GORDO: I was at both panels.
It was awesome.


49
0:1:59,985 --> 0:2:2,154
TRAVIS: Oh, thanks, man!
Thanks a lot.


50
0:2:2,154 --> 0:2:3,155
GORDO: I really like
what you said.


51
0:2:3,155 --> 0:2:4,59
TRAVIS: I appreciate it.


52
0:2:4,59 --> 0:2:5,925
What's your name?


53
0:2:5,925 --> 0:2:6,759
GORDO: Uh, Gordo.


54
0:2:6,759 --> 0:2:11,664
TRAVIS: Gordo, "To Gordo...


55
0:2:11,664 --> 0:2:13,199
Stay with it."


56
0:2:13,199 --> 0:2:15,1
GORDO: Yeah, if you ever have
like an assistant


57
0:2:15,1 --> 0:2:18,404
you could hire or something,
'cause, like, I write a lot.


58
0:2:18,404 --> 0:2:19,805
TRAVIS: This one fanboy, Gordo,


59
0:2:19,805 --> 0:2:21,707
he's been following me around
pretty much in this con.


60
0:2:21,707 --> 0:2:23,75
It happens sometimes.


61
0:2:23,75 --> 0:2:24,376
I have no idea
what he looked like,


62
0:2:24,376 --> 0:2:26,312
because he's wearing
a gray alien suit.


63
0:2:26,312 --> 0:2:33,953
TRAVIS: All right, thanks, man.
Thanks, Gordo.


64
0:2:33,953 --> 0:2:35,588
ROG: Travis ain't here,


65
0:2:35,588 --> 0:2:38,457
but that's no reason we can't
start the project without him.


66
0:2:38,457 --> 0:2:40,192
We've got enough brainpower here
to surprise him


67
0:2:40,192 --> 0:2:42,761
with a flying machine
by the time he gets back.


68
0:2:42,761 --> 0:2:43,896
Let's make a jetpack


69
0:2:43,896 --> 0:2:46,332
like they had on
the Six Million Dollar Man.


70
0:2:46,332 --> 0:2:47,299
You remember?


71
0:2:47,299 --> 0:2:48,3
He wanted to be an astronaut


72
0:2:48,3 --> 0:2:49,835
when he was, like,
six years old.


73
0:2:49,835 --> 0:2:51,303
That's why we have rocket stuff
laying around,


74
0:2:51,303 --> 0:2:53,239
because he's a rocket guy.


75
0:2:53,239 --> 0:2:54,84
DADDY:
Y'all think we can build one?


76
0:2:54,84 --> 0:2:56,875
ROG: Shoot, yeah,
we got some rockets.


77
0:2:56,875 --> 0:2:59,211
Well, Charlie, you care if
we rage and go power around,


78
0:2:59,211 --> 0:3:0,446
we get all the stuff we need?


79
0:3:0,446 --> 0:3:1,814
DADDY: Would it make
any difference?


80
0:3:1,814 --> 0:3:2,948
ROG: Well, you don't care.


81
0:3:2,948 --> 0:3:4,183
DADDY: Go ahead.


82
0:3:4,183 --> 0:3:5,818
ROG: Hey, Michael, we got
some of them mannequins.


83
0:3:5,818 --> 0:3:6,919
MICHAEL: Oh, I'm sure we do.


84
0:3:6,919 --> 0:3:8,787
DADDY: I think,
I think the truth...


85
0:3:8,787 --> 0:3:10,155
ROG: I'm fixing to write
on the chalkboard.


86
0:3:10,155 --> 0:3:13,959
Alright, Pete.


87
0:3:13,959 --> 0:3:15,494
I went up to the chalkboard,


88
0:3:15,494 --> 0:3:19,365
wrote Pete does the ciphering,
deciphering the math.


89
0:3:19,365 --> 0:3:22,468
These people in the south,
sometimes they decipher.


90
0:3:22,468 --> 0:3:23,569
That's what you do.


91
0:3:23,569 --> 0:3:25,571
Charlie.


92
0:3:25,571 --> 0:3:28,54
Charlie keeps everybody
straight.


93
0:3:28,54 --> 0:3:30,843
MICHAEL: I like that, Rog.


94
0:3:30,843 --> 0:3:32,911
ROG: Michael and I might have
to go on a road trip.


95
0:3:32,911 --> 0:3:34,313
DADDY: Road trip?


96
0:3:34,313 --> 0:3:36,282
ROG: Well, maybe it might
if it comes up.


97
0:3:36,282 --> 0:3:37,616
We don't know.


98
0:3:37,616 --> 0:3:40,519
There's nobody there to yell
and scream at everybody.


99
0:3:40,519 --> 0:3:43,122
And I thought, I can be a diva.


100
0:3:43,122 --> 0:3:44,456
That sounds like a good job.


101
0:3:44,456 --> 0:3:45,924
I'm gonna be Travis.


102
0:3:45,924 --> 0:3:48,227
You know he don't do nothing
but walk around and holler.


103
0:3:48,227 --> 0:3:49,495
DADDY: You know,
I got this suspicion,


104
0:3:49,495 --> 0:3:51,764
Rog has always wanted
to be the boss.


105
0:3:51,764 --> 0:3:54,33
ROG: He walks around here,
I hear him all the time.


106
0:3:54,33 --> 0:3:55,901
"Well, I'm gonna go
check on Rog."


107
0:3:55,901 --> 0:3:57,403
"Well, I'm gonna go
check on Daddy."


108
0:3:57,403 --> 0:3:59,4
[laughs]
PETE: That's right.


109
0:3:59,4 --> 0:4:0,205
MICHAEL: I'm gonna go
find them dummies.


110
0:4:0,205 --> 0:4:1,707
ROG: Charlie and I dug out
the rocket motors


111
0:4:1,707 --> 0:4:4,476
while Michael rounded up
a couple of dummies.


112
0:4:4,476 --> 0:4:7,98
Everything we needed
is right here.


113
0:4:7,98 --> 0:4:9,715
Boy, he's got pretty eyes.


114
0:4:9,715 --> 0:4:11,35
Is that, that's a boy, ain't it?


115
0:4:11,35 --> 0:4:13,319
I'm a sucker for pretty eyes,


116
0:4:13,319 --> 0:4:16,855
and them eyes were saying,
"I want to fly."


117
0:4:16,855 --> 0:4:19,858
Build like a frame,
put it on his back.


118
0:4:19,858 --> 0:4:23,62
All we need is a frame
and that...


119
0:4:23,62 --> 0:4:25,64
Charlie, can we use that
backpack over there?


120
0:4:25,64 --> 0:4:27,99
DADDY: Man, if that thing
pulls hard enough


121
0:4:27,99 --> 0:4:28,967
to pick him up off the ground...


122
0:4:28,967 --> 0:4:30,336
PETE: Yeah, I know.


123
0:4:30,336 --> 0:4:31,503
DADDY: You're gonna have to have
more than one strap


124
0:4:31,503 --> 0:4:32,571
coming through like that.


125
0:4:32,571 --> 0:4:33,872
That, that thing...


126
0:4:33,872 --> 0:4:36,508
PETE: Yeah, he's gonna need
a hefty jockstrap.


127
0:4:36,508 --> 0:4:38,677
Actually, building a jetpack
is more complex


128
0:4:38,677 --> 0:4:41,18
than just putting a rocket
in a backpack.


129
0:4:41,18 --> 0:4:44,35
These are K-sized motors with
nearly 100 pounds of thrust,


130
0:4:44,35 --> 0:4:45,584
so we'll need a structure


131
0:4:45,584 --> 0:4:48,887
to keep it from just
tearing off the backpack.


132
0:4:48,887 --> 0:4:51,223
We're also gonna need to add
some fins for flight stability


133
0:4:51,223 --> 0:4:54,593
if we want to get airborne.


134
0:4:54,593 --> 0:4:56,762
ROG: I'm gonna go check
on Michael and Pete.


135
0:4:56,762 --> 0:4:57,93
MICHAEL: Shut up, Rog!


136
0:4:57,93 --> 0:5:0,466
ROG: Oh, is it too early?


137
0:5:0,466 --> 0:5:2,167
MICHAEL: It was definitely
different with Rog,


138
0:5:2,167 --> 0:5:3,202
you know, running the show.


139
0:5:3,202 --> 0:5:4,37
ROG: Here.


140
0:5:4,37 --> 0:5:6,305
MICHAEL: Thanks, man.
I like you as the boss.


141
0:5:6,305 --> 0:5:8,44
ROG: Well, thank you.
I'm gonna check on Charlie.


142
0:5:8,44 --> 0:5:9,808
MICHAEL: That's the best thing
about Rog being the boss


143
0:5:9,808 --> 0:5:11,91
is he keeps you in beer.


144
0:5:11,91 --> 0:5:13,512
ROG: I'm gonna go check on Pete.


145
0:5:13,512 --> 0:5:14,947
PETE: Now I'm not sure
what Travis is up to


146
0:5:14,947 --> 0:5:16,615
at the sci-fi convention,


147
0:5:16,615 --> 0:5:18,684
but I doubt he's having
as much fun as we are


148
0:5:18,684 --> 0:5:20,819
watching Rog play boss.


149
0:5:20,819 --> 0:5:22,287
GORDO: So what are you doing
after this?


150
0:5:22,287 --> 0:5:23,922
TRAVIS: Uh, I'm not sure.


151
0:5:23,922 --> 0:5:26,625
I have to look at the schedule
what they got me scheduled for.


152
0:5:26,625 --> 0:5:30,162
Man, that Gordo was on me
like bees on honey.


153
0:5:30,162 --> 0:5:32,97
GORDO: Do you ever, like,
think for when you're writing,


154
0:5:32,97 --> 0:5:33,399
do you ever, like, have, like,


155
0:5:33,399 --> 0:5:35,134
an assistant that you'd hire
or something?


156
0:5:35,134 --> 0:5:36,268
TRAVIS: But, hey, I'll make time


157
0:5:36,268 --> 0:5:38,537
for anybody who loves
science fiction,


158
0:5:38,537 --> 0:5:41,44
because, to me,
it's very important.


159
0:5:41,44 --> 0:5:44,209
Science fiction drove me
to become a scientist,


160
0:5:44,209 --> 0:5:45,677
and I believe there are
all sorts of things


161
0:5:45,677 --> 0:5:49,314
in science fiction that
the authors imagine


162
0:5:49,314 --> 0:5:51,216
years before it ever happened.


163
0:5:51,216 --> 0:5:53,619
And in a lot of cases,
the reason it happened


164
0:5:53,619 --> 0:5:56,88
was because the scientist
or engineer read that story


165
0:5:56,88 --> 0:6:2,327
and said, hey, maybe,
just maybe.


166
0:6:2,327 --> 0:6:4,62
PETE: Careful,
that's a loaded rocket.


167
0:6:4,62 --> 0:6:7,366
ROG: Lock them nuts down
tight as you can get 'em, man.


168
0:6:7,366 --> 0:6:8,767
MICHAEL: Both of 'em?


169
0:6:8,767 --> 0:6:11,69
ROG: Yeah, both of 'em.


170
0:6:11,69 --> 0:6:13,472
See how fast stuff gets done
when I'm the boss?


171
0:6:13,472 --> 0:6:15,407
We got our jetpack
on our dummy's back


172
0:6:15,407 --> 0:6:17,543
and fins on his feet.


173
0:6:17,543 --> 0:6:19,411
This thing's almost ready to go.


174
0:6:19,411 --> 0:6:21,146
We got the thrust structure


175
0:6:21,146 --> 0:6:28,153
and the rocket with
100 pounds of thrust.


176
0:6:28,153 --> 0:6:29,555
He got pretty eyes still,
don't he?


177
0:6:29,555 --> 0:6:30,923
PETE: He does.


178
0:6:30,923 --> 0:6:32,458
DADDY: I wish you'd forget
about the eyes, Rog.


179
0:6:32,458 --> 0:6:34,593
ROG: Well.


180
0:6:34,593 --> 0:6:36,295
PETE: I've been trying to give
the guys some guidance


181
0:6:36,295 --> 0:6:38,464
in rocket science know-how.


182
0:6:38,464 --> 0:6:41,266
I'm a little concerned about
how this is gonna work.


183
0:6:41,266 --> 0:6:42,734
That's a K-motor in there.


184
0:6:42,734 --> 0:6:44,97
They are made for high-power
experimental rockets


185
0:6:44,97 --> 0:6:47,206
that are designed to go
about a mile high.


186
0:6:47,206 --> 0:6:49,975
It packs a lot of thrust in
a very short amount of time.


187
0:6:49,975 --> 0:6:51,81
MICHAEL: All right,
that backpack's locked down.


188
0:6:51,81 --> 0:6:54,513
PETE: But anytime we get to
strap a rocket to anything,


189
0:6:54,513 --> 0:6:56,148
it's always fun,
so I figure, what the heck.


190
0:6:56,148 --> 0:6:57,382
Let's see what happens


191
0:6:57,382 --> 0:7:0,252
and hopefully not get killed
in the process.


192
0:7:0,252 --> 0:7:2,187
ROG: Hey, look, right up there,
that's a good spot.


193
0:7:2,187 --> 0:7:4,356
PETE: So we headed off to
our favorite test field


194
0:7:4,356 --> 0:7:6,792
where we can stand as far away
from this thing as possible


195
0:7:6,792 --> 0:7:8,26
when it goes off.


196
0:7:8,26 --> 0:7:9,695
All right, we got a hot rocket!


197
0:7:9,695 --> 0:7:10,896
ROG: Hurry up, Pete!


198
0:7:10,896 --> 0:7:12,564
We ain't got time for
your shenanigans.


199
0:7:12,564 --> 0:7:13,799
MICHAEL: You know,
this is something that


200
0:7:13,799 --> 0:7:15,868
as long as it works
I want to try it out, too.


201
0:7:15,868 --> 0:7:16,735
ROG: Everybody ready?


202
0:7:16,735 --> 0:7:18,237
PETE: Yeah.


203
0:7:18,237 --> 0:7:19,538
DADDY: I hope this truck
protects us


204
0:7:19,538 --> 0:7:21,24
from what's about to happen.


205
0:7:21,24 --> 0:7:23,242
Part of me wants
to close my eyes,


206
0:7:23,242 --> 0:7:26,78
and the other part don't want
to miss a second.


207
0:7:26,78 --> 0:7:32,618
ROG: Three, two, one.


208
0:7:32,618 --> 0:7:33,886
[laughs]


209
0:7:33,886 --> 0:7:35,587
DADDY: Oh, man!


210
0:7:35,587 --> 0:7:39,191
You want to put my son
on that thing?


211
0:7:39,191 --> 0:7:43,829
ROG: We let it go
and she does a loop-de-loop.


212
0:7:43,829 --> 0:7:45,163
[laughs]


213
0:7:45,163 --> 0:7:48,166
DADDY: That thing went
end over end, heel over head,


214
0:7:48,166 --> 0:7:50,202
tumbling and it wrecked.


215
0:7:50,202 --> 0:7:51,87
Tore it all to pieces.


216
0:7:51,87 --> 0:7:54,306
MICHAEL: That thing
actually flew!


217
0:7:54,306 --> 0:7:56,41
DADDY: Actually flew?


218
0:7:56,41 --> 0:7:58,11
Yeah, it flipped in circles.


219
0:7:58,11 --> 0:7:59,244
MICHAEL: Three circles.


220
0:7:59,244 --> 0:8:1,46
ROG: He did a face-plant.
Look at here.


221
0:8:1,46 --> 0:8:3,949
DADDY: A mannequin is not
a very good rocket.


222
0:8:3,949 --> 0:8:5,717
What did you think
it was gonna do?


223
0:8:5,717 --> 0:8:7,386
ROG: Well, if it don't work,
we'll go do something else.


224
0:8:7,386 --> 0:8:10,589
Let's go back and draw pictures
on the chalkboard,


225
0:8:10,589 --> 0:8:12,257
figure out something better
that we can control.


226
0:8:12,257 --> 0:8:13,392
PETE: Yeah.


227
0:8:13,392 --> 0:8:15,594
ROG: So much for the first
jetpack idea.


228
0:8:15,594 --> 0:8:17,229
Maybe we need bigger rockets.


229
0:8:17,229 --> 0:8:19,598
I figured I'd call Travis
and see what he thinks.


230
0:8:19,598 --> 0:8:22,501
TRAVIS: What?


231
0:8:22,501 --> 0:8:23,669
Hang on just a minute, Gordo.


232
0:8:23,669 --> 0:8:27,172
Rog, Rog, you, you're...


233
0:8:27,172 --> 0:8:29,207
No, you can't do that
with a rocket engine, Rog.


234
0:8:29,207 --> 0:8:31,543
In fact, it'll blow up.


235
0:8:31,543 --> 0:8:35,781
No, hang on just a minute.


236
0:8:35,781 --> 0:8:37,149
I'll talk to you in a minute,
Gordo.


237
0:8:37,149 --> 0:8:39,851
It's alright.


238
0:8:39,851 --> 0:8:41,687
What?


239
0:8:41,687 --> 0:8:44,289
No, you can't put
a rocket engine on that.


240
0:8:44,289 --> 0:8:45,657
Rog, those motors are too big.


241
0:8:45,657 --> 0:8:47,359
It'll start a fire
and it might blow up.


242
0:8:47,359 --> 0:8:49,828
It'll kill somebody.


243
0:8:49,828 --> 0:8:52,397
No, I--what are you--
I can't believe that.


244
0:8:52,397 --> 0:8:54,6
I got to--
no, you're not doing that.


245
0:8:54,6 --> 0:9:0,772
I decided I'd better get back
before Rog blows everybody up.


246
0:9:0,772 --> 0:9:3,375
ROG: Travis didn't seem too keen
on bigger rockets.


247
0:9:3,375 --> 0:9:5,377
Luckily, Michael came up
with a totally different


248
0:9:5,377 --> 0:9:7,346
flying machine idea.


249
0:9:7,346 --> 0:9:8,714
MICHAEL: We were on the way back
from this test


250
0:9:8,714 --> 0:9:9,982
and I had an idea.


251
0:9:9,982 --> 0:9:12,15
I got this helicopter that,
you know, it flies.


252
0:9:12,15 --> 0:9:15,22
I built it out of a kit and
a bunch of radio control parts.


253
0:9:15,22 --> 0:9:17,556
This radio-controlled,
six-blade chopper,


254
0:9:17,556 --> 0:9:19,191
thought it would work real good
for a flying machine


255
0:9:19,191 --> 0:9:21,526
if you, you know,
scale it up a whole lot.


256
0:9:21,526 --> 0:9:23,662
It's something that's stable
and that we can control,


257
0:9:23,662 --> 0:9:26,164
and it's a whole lot safer
to ride on.


258
0:9:26,164 --> 0:9:27,866
This is a radio-controlled
helicopter.


259
0:9:27,866 --> 0:9:29,801
Here you go, Rog, you think
you can fly this thing?


260
0:9:29,801 --> 0:9:31,236
ROG: No, I can't fly.


261
0:9:31,236 --> 0:9:33,605
DADDY: We're gonna have to
build it to pick up 200 pounds,


262
0:9:33,605 --> 0:9:35,14
'cause that's what your Uncle
Travis is gonna want to do.


263
0:9:35,14 --> 0:9:36,441
He's gonna want
to fly the thing.


264
0:9:36,441 --> 0:9:37,943
ROG: Of course, we're gonna
have to do a test


265
0:9:37,943 --> 0:9:40,278
before we strap a bunch of these
on Travis.


266
0:9:40,278 --> 0:9:42,314
And since we only have
one copter right now,


267
0:9:42,314 --> 0:9:44,683
I grabbed our little
two-pound light mannequin.


268
0:9:44,683 --> 0:9:45,984
DADDY: What?


269
0:9:45,984 --> 0:9:47,919
ROG: Lookie here.
You know it'll pick him up.


270
0:9:47,919 --> 0:9:49,588
DADDY: Well, that thing
don't weigh anything.


271
0:9:49,588 --> 0:9:52,24
ROG: Well, still, that's what
we gonna tow to, ain't it?


272
0:9:52,24 --> 0:9:54,493
MICHAEL: Ain't tried carrying
anything with this copter yet,


273
0:9:54,493 --> 0:9:55,927
so it's good to start light.


274
0:9:55,927 --> 0:9:57,129
We need to make sure
we can control it


275
0:9:57,129 --> 0:9:59,631
before adding too much weight.


276
0:9:59,631 --> 0:10:5,737
ROG: Let's see what
this thing will do.


277
0:10:5,737 --> 0:10:7,139
ROG: Wake up, mule, wake up.


278
0:10:7,139 --> 0:10:9,708
MICHAEL: Wake up!


279
0:10:9,708 --> 0:10:13,345
PETE: Oh, man, you got plenty
of lift right there.


280
0:10:13,345 --> 0:10:15,547
TRAVIS: When I pulled up,
there was the weirdest thing


281
0:10:15,547 --> 0:10:19,651
I'd ever seen
in Daddy's front yard.


282
0:10:19,651 --> 0:10:21,153
MICHAEL: Hey.


283
0:10:21,153 --> 0:10:22,688
TRAVIS: What in the wide, wide
world of sports


284
0:10:22,688 --> 0:10:28,994
is going on here?


285
0:10:28,994 --> 0:10:31,263
DADDY: These Experiments are
dangerous.


286
0:10:31,263 --> 0:10:33,665
These guys are real rocket
scientists


287
0:10:33,665 --> 0:10:38,103
Don't try this at home!


288
0:10:38,103 --> 0:10:40,572
TRAVIS: We're building
a one-man flying machine.


289
0:10:40,572 --> 0:10:42,641
Since I was at
a science fiction convention,


290
0:10:42,641 --> 0:10:44,976
the guys got started without me.


291
0:10:44,976 --> 0:10:45,977
ROG: Everybody ready?


292
0:10:45,977 --> 0:10:49,781
PETE: Yeah.


293
0:10:49,781 --> 0:10:51,49
[laughs]


294
0:10:51,49 --> 0:10:52,551
DADDY: Oh, man.


295
0:10:52,551 --> 0:10:55,52
TRAVIS: Looks like I couldn't
have got home a moment too soon.


296
0:10:55,52 --> 0:10:57,656
[horn honks]


297
0:10:57,656 --> 0:10:59,558
[laughs]


298
0:10:59,558 --> 0:11:2,427
What in the wide, wide world
of sports is going on here?


299
0:11:2,427 --> 0:11:4,196
DADDY: We're playing
with your new toy.


300
0:11:4,196 --> 0:11:5,43
TRAVIS: Look at that!


301
0:11:5,43 --> 0:11:7,99
I got home from
the science fiction convention


302
0:11:7,99 --> 0:11:9,334
and I pull into Daddy's, and
there are the guys out there,


303
0:11:9,334 --> 0:11:12,437
and they've got this,
this helicopter thing up there,


304
0:11:12,437 --> 0:11:14,106
and there's a dummy
hanging from it.


305
0:11:14,106 --> 0:11:16,108
I mean, what in the world
are they doing?


306
0:11:16,108 --> 0:11:17,776
It looked cool, though.


307
0:11:17,776 --> 0:11:20,145
DADDY: Now, I'm gonna tell you,
this is the second effort.


308
0:11:20,145 --> 0:11:21,68
The first one was
a total bomb-out.


309
0:11:21,68 --> 0:11:22,914
TRAVIS: What'd y'all do
the first go around?


310
0:11:22,914 --> 0:11:24,85
ROG: Come over here and look.
We'll show you.


311
0:11:24,85 --> 0:11:26,118
TRAVIS: I thought it was
pretty cool of the guys


312
0:11:26,118 --> 0:11:28,153
to be working on the one-man
flying machine thing


313
0:11:28,153 --> 0:11:30,255
while I was off at
the science fiction convention.


314
0:11:30,255 --> 0:11:32,124
It feels heavy.
What motor did you use on it?


315
0:11:32,124 --> 0:11:35,26
PETE: K-motor.
TRAVIS: A K-motor! Holy crap!


316
0:11:35,26 --> 0:11:36,161
That'll do it.


317
0:11:36,161 --> 0:11:37,763
Broke this one's leg off!


318
0:11:37,763 --> 0:11:39,531
MICHAEL: He broke his own
leg off when he crashed.


319
0:11:39,531 --> 0:11:41,466
TRAVIS: Oh, and his head!


320
0:11:41,466 --> 0:11:42,667
DADDY: That's about
what you'd look like


321
0:11:42,667 --> 0:11:44,202
if you'd been hooked
on to that thing.


322
0:11:44,202 --> 0:11:46,538
TRAVIS: I wouldn't let y'all
hook a K-motor to my back.


323
0:11:46,538 --> 0:11:47,739
DADDY: We decided
we had to do something,


324
0:11:47,739 --> 0:11:49,808
then Michael had
this helicopter.


325
0:11:49,808 --> 0:11:51,71
TRAVIS: It's not a bad idea.


326
0:11:51,71 --> 0:11:52,978
We could probably do this


327
0:11:52,978 --> 0:11:55,247
if we could find the motors
and the propellers.


328
0:11:55,247 --> 0:11:57,883
We're gonna scale up Michael's
remote-control helicopter


329
0:11:57,883 --> 0:12:1,186
so that it's big enough
to lift one man.


330
0:12:1,186 --> 0:12:3,321
ROG: Look at these
pretty eyes, mule.


331
0:12:3,321 --> 0:12:5,791
Have you seen these eyes
on this guy?


332
0:12:5,791 --> 0:12:7,192
TRAVIS: So I sent the guys
to find


333
0:12:7,192 --> 0:12:10,228
the biggest hobby helicopter
propellers they could find.


334
0:12:10,228 --> 0:12:11,897
We're back in business.


335
0:12:11,897 --> 0:12:13,532
You know where to get
that kind of stuff?


336
0:12:13,532 --> 0:12:14,566
MICHAEL: Yeah, I know where
we can find some.


337
0:12:14,566 --> 0:12:15,433
ROG: Let's go, road trip.


338
0:12:15,433 --> 0:12:17,736
MICHAEL: Road trip, Rog,
come on!


339
0:12:17,736 --> 0:12:19,4
ROG: Travis came back in


340
0:12:19,4 --> 0:12:22,34
and fell right into
his diva-boss-princess mode.


341
0:12:22,34 --> 0:12:24,576
TRAVIS: Buy every big motor
they got!


342
0:12:24,576 --> 0:12:26,11
ROG: I didn't mind,
'cause first thing I got to do


343
0:12:26,11 --> 0:12:27,279
is go on a road trip.


344
0:12:27,279 --> 0:12:29,14
TRAVIS: Tell 'em to put it
on Rog's tab.


345
0:12:29,14 --> 0:12:30,382
MICHAEL: All right.


346
0:12:30,382 --> 0:12:32,517
PETE: And don't forget
propellers and controllers.


347
0:12:32,517 --> 0:12:34,986
TRAVIS: We're gonna create
a lightweight aluminum frame


348
0:12:34,986 --> 0:12:37,956
with six arms to hold six of the
biggest motors and propellers


349
0:12:37,956 --> 0:12:39,257
we can find.


350
0:12:39,257 --> 0:12:42,26
Then we'll have the pilot seated
underneath it all


351
0:12:42,26 --> 0:12:43,562
in a lawn chair.


352
0:12:43,562 --> 0:12:45,831
We are gonna add
thick Lexan shields


353
0:12:45,831 --> 0:12:47,999
on all sides of the cockpit.


354
0:12:47,999 --> 0:12:54,239
To protect the pilot from debris
and the chopper blades.


355
0:12:54,239 --> 0:12:55,674
Once Michael and Rog got back


356
0:12:55,674 --> 0:12:58,176
with a whole bunch of motors
and propellers,


357
0:12:58,176 --> 0:12:59,678
I started divvying up the jobs.


358
0:12:59,678 --> 0:13:1,98
Sent Daddy and Rog to start
cutting the materials,


359
0:13:1,98 --> 0:13:3,415
Michael started
drilling the holes,


360
0:13:3,415 --> 0:13:5,817
Pete and I were figuring out how
it was all gonna fit together.


361
0:13:5,817 --> 0:13:7,152
It's gonna be a cage like that,


362
0:13:7,152 --> 0:13:9,87
so now figure out those pieces,
Pete.


363
0:13:9,87 --> 0:13:10,488
PETE: All right.


364
0:13:10,488 --> 0:13:12,19
TRAVIS: We're real concerned
that the motors we got


365
0:13:12,19 --> 0:13:15,727
were not gonna be enough
to lift me and the helicopter,


366
0:13:15,727 --> 0:13:17,929
so we had to do a test.


367
0:13:17,929 --> 0:13:19,197
DADDY: We set up a scale system


368
0:13:19,197 --> 0:13:20,699
so we could measure
the lift weight


369
0:13:20,699 --> 0:13:22,434
of the motor and the propellers.


370
0:13:22,434 --> 0:13:24,502
Now, I keep telling these boys,


371
0:13:24,502 --> 0:13:27,539
these blades are very sharp
and very dangerous,


372
0:13:27,539 --> 0:13:29,474
they can shatter any second


373
0:13:29,474 --> 0:13:32,277
and send wooden spikes
going in all directions.


374
0:13:32,277 --> 0:13:33,945
TRAVIS: Stay away from
the blade, Pete.


375
0:13:33,945 --> 0:13:36,281
DADDY: I made everybody get
behind a blast shield


376
0:13:36,281 --> 0:13:37,482
for protection.


377
0:13:37,482 --> 0:13:40,218
Come on, son,
it'll take your head off.


378
0:13:40,218 --> 0:13:41,119
TRAVIS: You guys ready?


379
0:13:41,119 --> 0:13:42,12
ROG: Yeah.
MICHAEL: Yeah.


380
0:13:42,12 --> 0:13:45,323
TRAVIS: All right, here we go.


381
0:13:45,323 --> 0:13:50,295
5, 10, 15...


382
0:13:50,295 --> 0:13:55,533
20, 25, 30...


383
0:13:55,533 --> 0:13:57,602
almost 35 at times.


384
0:13:57,602 --> 0:13:59,971
PETE: That's all...


385
0:13:59,971 --> 0:14:2,507
TRAVIS: All right,
bring her down.


386
0:14:2,507 --> 0:14:4,843
It looks like we're gonna get
about 33 pounds of lift


387
0:14:4,843 --> 0:14:6,244
from each motor.


388
0:14:6,244 --> 0:14:8,38
That's including lifting
its own weight.


389
0:14:8,38 --> 0:14:9,381
PETE: Let's unhook it.


390
0:14:9,381 --> 0:14:11,449
TRAVIS:
Yeah, unhook the battery.


391
0:14:11,449 --> 0:14:17,255
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What'd you do?


392
0:14:17,255 --> 0:14:18,189
[whistles]


393
0:14:18,189 --> 0:14:19,291
MICHAEL:
Don't turn it off, Pete.


394
0:14:19,291 --> 0:14:20,525
You nev--don't ever cut that.


395
0:14:20,525 --> 0:14:21,86
PETE: Yep, I remember that now.


396
0:14:21,86 --> 0:14:24,596
MICHAEL: Yeah.


397
0:14:24,596 --> 0:14:27,499
TRAVIS: Man, you weren't
but an inch from that.


398
0:14:27,499 --> 0:14:29,234
Don't do that again.


399
0:14:29,234 --> 0:14:30,835
PETE: When that motor started up
right next to me,


400
0:14:30,835 --> 0:14:33,305
probably doing
a good 2,000 RPMs,


401
0:14:33,305 --> 0:14:35,974
that scared the crap out of me.


402
0:14:35,974 --> 0:14:38,576
TRAVIS: I'm really glad Pete
has those Aikido reflexes.


403
0:14:38,576 --> 0:14:41,212
He got away from it really quick
and turned everything off.


404
0:14:41,212 --> 0:14:44,149
PETE: You know, that's one
of the times luck won out.


405
0:14:44,149 --> 0:14:45,35
TRAVIS: We're gonna be right on
the hairy edge


406
0:14:45,35 --> 0:14:48,186
of having enough lift to do it.


407
0:14:48,186 --> 0:14:50,755
PETE: Yeah, I know.


408
0:14:50,755 --> 0:14:53,291
TRAVIS: Once we got the aluminum
cut and the holes drilled,


409
0:14:53,291 --> 0:14:56,394
we began to put together
the frame of our flying machine.


410
0:14:56,394 --> 0:14:58,43
It's got to hold
six of those motors


411
0:14:58,43 --> 0:15:1,199
and the pilot will hang
beneath it in a lawn chair,


412
0:15:1,199 --> 0:15:5,7
surrounded by thick, protective,
plastic shields.


413
0:15:5,7 --> 0:15:8,39
DADDY: It's another long day
and another long night.


414
0:15:8,39 --> 0:15:10,41
Thankfully,
Travis picked up some dinner


415
0:15:10,41 --> 0:15:13,812
to help us get through.


416
0:15:13,812 --> 0:15:16,514
TRAVIS: By morning, we had
most of the frame together.


417
0:15:16,514 --> 0:15:19,784
Our propeller test showed us
that we needed six propellers,


418
0:15:19,784 --> 0:15:21,586
but with the extra weight
of the shields,


419
0:15:21,586 --> 0:15:24,389
I was afraid that wasn't
gonna give us enough lift.


420
0:15:24,389 --> 0:15:26,324
So we added two more propellers.


421
0:15:26,324 --> 0:15:27,659
TRAVIS:
You got these two blades.


422
0:15:27,659 --> 0:15:29,694
They're opposite direction
and opposite pitch.


423
0:15:29,694 --> 0:15:31,396
That end's got to be
the same as that one.


424
0:15:31,396 --> 0:15:32,464
PETE: Right.


425
0:15:32,464 --> 0:15:34,432
TRAVIS: Once we had it
all wired up,


426
0:15:34,432 --> 0:15:36,835
we added some safety cushions
and padding,


427
0:15:36,835 --> 0:15:39,17
and we were ready
to fly this puppy.


428
0:15:39,17 --> 0:15:40,572
There are a lot of things
that could go wrong


429
0:15:40,572 --> 0:15:41,873
with this helicopter,


430
0:15:41,873 --> 0:15:43,241
but there are a lot of things
that could go right.


431
0:15:43,241 --> 0:15:44,709
MICHAEL: What do y'all reckon
it weighs?


432
0:15:44,709 --> 0:15:46,745
TRAVIS: I don't know,
I'm thinking with everything,


433
0:15:46,745 --> 0:15:49,414
the motors and all,
about 80 pounds.


434
0:15:49,414 --> 0:15:51,449
DADDY: If this thing weighs
80 or 100 pounds,


435
0:15:51,449 --> 0:15:53,351
and Travis weighs 200 pounds,


436
0:15:53,351 --> 0:15:56,87
that's around 300 pounds
we need to lift.


437
0:15:56,87 --> 0:15:58,423
That's beyond the hairy edge,
if you ask me.


438
0:15:58,423 --> 0:16:0,625
TRAVIS: Into the wind, yeah,
back toward the house.


439
0:16:0,625 --> 0:16:4,629
Alright, right there.


440
0:16:4,629 --> 0:16:6,164
That's a pretty strong one.


441
0:16:6,164 --> 0:16:7,699
Where'd that wind come from?
Ain't been blowing all day.


442
0:16:7,699 --> 0:16:9,501
We come out to test fly
the helicopter.


443
0:16:9,501 --> 0:16:11,736
Alright, let's clear out.


444
0:16:11,736 --> 0:16:14,939
For safety's sake, Daddy ain't
gonna let me get in that thing


445
0:16:14,939 --> 0:16:17,842
until we know it'll fly
and we can control it.


446
0:16:17,842 --> 0:16:19,744
But as soon as we can
fly it right,


447
0:16:19,744 --> 0:16:23,415
I'm gonna hop right in it
and have the ride of my life.


448
0:16:23,415 --> 0:16:26,17
Alright, guys, this is it.
I want this thing to fly.


449
0:16:26,17 --> 0:16:26,851
ROG: Who don't?


450
0:16:26,851 --> 0:16:28,353
TRAVIS: Yeah, I tell you what!


451
0:16:28,353 --> 0:16:30,121
Come on, let's bring
the power up!


452
0:16:30,121 --> 0:16:31,99
ROG: Spinning mule.


453
0:16:31,99 --> 0:16:32,891
DADDY: There she goes.


454
0:16:32,891 --> 0:16:34,92
TRAVIS: They're all spinning.


455
0:16:34,92 --> 0:16:35,393
PETE: That's a good sign.


456
0:16:35,393 --> 0:16:39,631
TRAVIS: Bring it up
nice and easy, nice and easy.


457
0:16:39,631 --> 0:16:40,465
DADDY: Come on.


458
0:16:40,465 --> 0:16:41,8
TRAVIS: Come on, baby, come on.


459
0:16:41,8 --> 0:16:42,801
DADDY: Come on.


460
0:16:42,801 --> 0:16:44,469
TRAVIS: Come on.


461
0:16:44,469 --> 0:16:46,137
DADDY: Get up.


462
0:16:46,137 --> 0:16:47,338
TRAVIS: Coming on up,
coming on up.


463
0:16:47,338 --> 0:16:48,173
DADDY: Get up.


464
0:16:48,173 --> 0:16:50,775
TRAVIS: Coming on up.


465
0:16:50,775 --> 0:16:53,912
Well, she's kicking up
some dust a little.


466
0:16:53,912 --> 0:16:55,78
Coming off the ground,
coming off the ground.


467
0:16:55,78 --> 0:16:58,116
We're flying! We're flying!


468
0:16:58,116 --> 0:17:0,351
We're flying!


469
0:17:0,351 --> 0:17:1,319
We're flying!


470
0:17:1,319 --> 0:17:3,521
PETE: Oh.


471
0:17:3,521 --> 0:17:7,158
TRAVIS: Oh!


472
0:17:7,158 --> 0:17:7,992
Crap!


473
0:17:7,992 --> 0:17:15,133
ROG: Son of a...


474
0:17:15,133 --> 0:17:16,367
TRAVIS:
We spent the whole weekend


475
0:17:16,367 --> 0:17:18,536
building a one-man
flying machine...


476
0:17:18,536 --> 0:17:21,72
Let's all grab a leg
and let's fly it.


477
0:17:21,72 --> 0:17:21,94
PETE: All right.


478
0:17:21,94 --> 0:17:23,7
TRAVIS: ...and we finally went


479
0:17:23,7 --> 0:17:25,9
to get our homemade copter
airborne.


480
0:17:25,9 --> 0:17:29,8
Coming off the ground.
We're flying! We're flying!


481
0:17:29,8 --> 0:17:30,281
We're flying!


482
0:17:30,281 --> 0:17:32,75
But then, disaster.


483
0:17:32,75 --> 0:17:35,353
Oh!


484
0:17:35,353 --> 0:17:38,256
MICHAEL: This one right here's
busted all to, hmm.


485
0:17:38,256 --> 0:17:41,25
TRAVIS: We blew another,
another gusset here.


486
0:17:41,25 --> 0:17:43,795
DADDY: Here's one propeller
tore all to pieces.


487
0:17:43,795 --> 0:17:45,73
TRAVIS: This isn't anything
unheard of


488
0:17:45,73 --> 0:17:49,534
when you're talking about
experimental aircraft.


489
0:17:49,534 --> 0:17:55,14
You don't ever get it right
the first time.


490
0:17:55,14 --> 0:17:57,242
Now I got to go back and see
what we broke,


491
0:17:57,242 --> 0:18:1,679
what ain't broke,
what we got to do to fix it.


492
0:18:1,679 --> 0:18:4,949
We made three major
modifications to the copter.


493
0:18:4,949 --> 0:18:7,585
We made the frame taller
and the base wider,


494
0:18:7,585 --> 0:18:9,854
so it's less likely to flip.


495
0:18:9,854 --> 0:18:12,157
We got rid of the Lexan
protective shields


496
0:18:12,157 --> 0:18:15,393
to lighten it up,
and most importantly,


497
0:18:15,393 --> 0:18:17,162
we doubled the amount
of propellers


498
0:18:17,162 --> 0:18:19,931
with top rotors and
bottom rotors on each arm.


499
0:18:19,931 --> 0:18:22,233
That should give it
twice the lift.


500
0:18:22,233 --> 0:18:25,69
Now we're gonna take it out
and I'm gonna ride that thing.


501
0:18:25,69 --> 0:18:28,439
Let's take this thing around
the corner and hook it up.


502
0:18:28,439 --> 0:18:29,641
DADDY: Wait a minute, son.


503
0:18:29,641 --> 0:18:31,176
TRAVIS: What have you got there?


504
0:18:31,176 --> 0:18:34,279
DADDY: I got old Sidney here.
He's gonna pilot this thing.


505
0:18:34,279 --> 0:18:35,613
There's no way in the world


506
0:18:35,613 --> 0:18:38,883
you're gonna get in that thing
before we try it.


507
0:18:38,883 --> 0:18:41,85
This contraption is more
dangerous than ever.


508
0:18:41,85 --> 0:18:43,321
They not only took off
the safety shields,


509
0:18:43,321 --> 0:18:46,491
they doubled the rotors,
so it's twice as deadly.


510
0:18:46,491 --> 0:18:50,662
We need a test dummy before
I let anybody get in that thing.


511
0:18:50,662 --> 0:18:52,564
TRAVIS: We better tie this thing
down really good, though.


512
0:18:52,564 --> 0:18:55,667
I don't want anything coming
loose and getting into a blade.


513
0:18:55,667 --> 0:18:59,37
We moved the whole thing to
the test site in the backyard.


514
0:18:59,37 --> 0:19:1,105
Crawl up under there
and tie it off.


515
0:19:1,105 --> 0:19:3,474
And then we tethered the copter
to the ground


516
0:19:3,474 --> 0:19:7,11
to keep it from flying away
out of control or flipping over.


517
0:19:7,11 --> 0:19:9,147
So I think it's about
as safe as it'll get.


518
0:19:9,147 --> 0:19:11,749
Y'all get back away from 'em.
Y'all get out of there.


519
0:19:11,749 --> 0:19:13,284
MICHAEL: It's good.


520
0:19:13,284 --> 0:19:14,586
TRAVIS: Alright, spin test.


521
0:19:14,586 --> 0:19:16,154
Get over here where you're safe
in the safe zone.


522
0:19:16,154 --> 0:19:18,122
Everybody in the safe zone now.


523
0:19:18,122 --> 0:19:20,124
Be ready to run away
from the helicopter.


524
0:19:20,124 --> 0:19:21,326
ROG: Yeah.


525
0:19:21,326 --> 0:19:23,595
TRAVIS: We're gonna throttle it
up a little.


526
0:19:23,595 --> 0:19:26,831
Here we go!


527
0:19:26,831 --> 0:19:31,2
Everything's still spinning.


528
0:19:31,2 --> 0:19:32,136
Come on, baby.


529
0:19:32,136 --> 0:19:38,676
PETE: Come on.


530
0:19:38,676 --> 0:19:41,112
ROG: There you go, son!


531
0:19:41,112 --> 0:19:42,8
There it is!


532
0:19:42,8 --> 0:19:43,448
TRAVIS: Yeah!


533
0:19:43,448 --> 0:19:44,616
ROG: That's a good deal.


534
0:19:44,616 --> 0:19:45,984
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah!
Now we're talking.


535
0:19:45,984 --> 0:19:47,118
ROG: Alright!


536
0:19:47,118 --> 0:19:48,419
PETE: There you go.


537
0:19:48,419 --> 0:19:49,721
TRAVIS: Now let's bring
her down, bring her down.


538
0:19:49,721 --> 0:19:50,922
PETE: Bring it down.


539
0:19:50,922 --> 0:19:53,224
Easy, easy.


540
0:19:53,224 --> 0:19:54,626
TRAVIS: Yeah, right there.


541
0:19:54,626 --> 0:19:56,894
PETE: Good job, man,
that was awesome!


542
0:19:56,894 --> 0:19:58,429
TRAVIS: Helicopter taters.


543
0:19:58,429 --> 0:20:0,298
That was awesome.


544
0:20:0,298 --> 0:20:2,3
The copter flew perfectly level.


545
0:20:2,3 --> 0:20:5,236
It looked like it could've just
flown like that forever.


546
0:20:5,236 --> 0:20:6,971
It was a perfect test flight.


547
0:20:6,971 --> 0:20:8,906
Now it's my turn.


548
0:20:8,906 --> 0:20:11,9
Now we got to recharge
the batteries


549
0:20:11,9 --> 0:20:13,177
and let's do a man flight.


550
0:20:13,177 --> 0:20:15,213
DADDY: I'm still not confident
with this.


551
0:20:15,213 --> 0:20:17,515
That dummy's only
20 pounds or so.


552
0:20:17,515 --> 0:20:20,51
Travis is eight or ten times
heavier.


553
0:20:20,51 --> 0:20:21,986
This might not even
get off the ground,


554
0:20:21,986 --> 0:20:23,288
and if it tips over again,


555
0:20:23,288 --> 0:20:27,825
Travis could be
seriously injured.


556
0:20:27,825 --> 0:20:29,227
ROG: Look at that boy, yeah.


557
0:20:29,227 --> 0:20:31,329
TRAVIS: I've got my fireproof
race driver's suit


558
0:20:31,329 --> 0:20:32,397
and my helmet,


559
0:20:32,397 --> 0:20:34,532
and I'm ready to be
the test pilot.


560
0:20:34,532 --> 0:20:35,933
Y'all about got it ready?


561
0:20:35,933 --> 0:20:37,635
This is gonna be a lot of fun.


562
0:20:37,635 --> 0:20:39,337
DADDY: Is there any way
I could talk you out of this?


563
0:20:39,337 --> 0:20:41,572
TRAVIS: Probably not, Daddy.


564
0:20:41,572 --> 0:20:43,308
MICHAEL: Get in there
and fire it up.


565
0:20:43,308 --> 0:20:46,11
TRAVIS: I can't wait to get in
that thing and fly it.


566
0:20:46,11 --> 0:20:48,346
MICHAEL: Do your little test and
then as long as they all spin,


567
0:20:48,346 --> 0:20:50,982
we're out of here.


568
0:20:50,982 --> 0:20:52,417
Got it, we're gone.


569
0:20:52,417 --> 0:20:54,686
PETE: Alright. The field
is clear, you're good to go!


570
0:20:54,686 --> 0:21:5,63
MICHAEL: It's all you!


571
0:21:5,63 --> 0:21:6,397
PETE: All right.


572
0:21:6,397 --> 0:21:7,398
DADDY: Oh!


573
0:21:7,398 --> 0:21:9,33
It ain't gonna work.


574
0:21:9,33 --> 0:21:17,675
I knew it.


575
0:21:17,675 --> 0:21:22,48
ROG: Yeah!


576
0:21:22,48 --> 0:21:23,915
PETE: Yeah!


577
0:21:23,915 --> 0:21:29,721
ROG: All right.


578
0:21:29,721 --> 0:21:34,25
PETE: Yeah!


579
0:21:34,25 --> 0:21:34,992
ROG: Look at him, son!


580
0:21:34,992 --> 0:21:36,461
PETE: Woo!


581
0:21:36,461 --> 0:21:38,496
MICHAEL: That's awesome,
that's awesome! Shut him down.


582
0:21:38,496 --> 0:21:41,299
TRAVIS: When I hit the ground
and I realized I wasn't dead,


583
0:21:41,299 --> 0:21:44,168
I thought that was the greatest
thing I'd ever done.


584
0:21:44,168 --> 0:21:45,57
Look at that.


585
0:21:45,57 --> 0:21:47,672
PETE: That was awesome, buddy!


586
0:21:47,672 --> 0:21:48,506
TRAVIS: How about that?


587
0:21:48,506 --> 0:21:49,407
PETE: How'd that feel?


588
0:21:49,407 --> 0:21:50,675
TRAVIS: Oh, that was great!


589
0:21:50,675 --> 0:21:51,876
DADDY: You know,
this has got to be


590
0:21:51,876 --> 0:21:53,344
what the Wright brothers
went through.


591
0:21:53,344 --> 0:21:54,712
They didn't know if
they could fly or not,


592
0:21:54,712 --> 0:21:57,515
but they proved that they could
and this afternoon,


593
0:21:57,515 --> 0:21:59,884
Travis proved that we could
build a helicopter right here


594
0:21:59,884 --> 0:22:3,54
in this garage
and make the thing fly.


595
0:22:3,54 --> 0:22:4,689
TRAVIS: Man, let me tell you,
it felt like,


596
0:22:4,689 --> 0:22:6,491
I couldn't really tell how high
I was off the ground,


597
0:22:6,491 --> 0:22:8,393
but at one time I thought
I was up there pretty good.


598
0:22:8,393 --> 0:22:9,894
PETE: Oh, you were about
like that, yeah.


599
0:22:9,894 --> 0:22:11,562
TRAVIS: That was cool, man.


600
0:22:11,562 --> 0:22:14,298
DADDY: I tell you,
it was a hoot. I loved it.


601
0:22:14,298 --> 0:22:16,1
TRAVIS: Go watch any flight test
on a new vehicle,


602
0:22:16,1 --> 0:22:17,502
they only fly it a few feet
off the ground


603
0:22:17,502 --> 0:22:19,537
the first few times anyway.


604
0:22:19,537 --> 0:22:22,206
That's 100% success right there.


605
0:22:22,206 --> 0:22:23,941
ROG: Well, it ain't a jetpack,


606
0:22:23,941 --> 0:22:28,78
but we built a flying machine
in a garage and made it fly.


607
0:22:28,78 --> 0:22:32,75
It's like something out of
Travis' sci-fi books.


608
0:22:32,75 --> 0:24:32,75
I bet even his biggest fan
wouldn't believe this.
