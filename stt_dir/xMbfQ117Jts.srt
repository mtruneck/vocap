1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:1,86



2
0:0:1,86 --> 0:0:3,81
FRED PHELPS: What's wrong with
this country and England and


3
0:0:3,81 --> 0:0:8,2
the world is that they have
bought Satan's lie that it's


4
0:0:8,2 --> 0:0:11,14
OK to be gay.


5
0:0:11,14 --> 0:0:15,505
Our message is, it's
not OK to be gay.


6
0:0:15,505 --> 0:0:20,994
It will warp the mind, destroy
the soul, and damn the nation,


7
0:0:20,994 --> 0:0:22,491
damn the nation.


8
0:0:22,491 --> 0:0:26,233
Westboro Baptist Church of
Topeka is an Old School, or


9
0:0:26,233 --> 0:0:27,78
Primitive Baptist, church.


10
0:0:27,78 --> 0:0:32,252



11
0:0:32,252 --> 0:0:33,87
DENISE HALL: You know,
he's quite a showman,


12
0:0:33,87 --> 0:0:34,935
and he knows that.


13
0:0:34,935 --> 0:0:36,97
They've gotten a big long
run out of this.


14
0:0:36,97 --> 0:0:41,344



15
0:0:41,344 --> 0:0:42,316
FEMALE SPEAKER: Make a sign.


16
0:0:42,316 --> 0:0:43,288
God hates fags.


17
0:0:43,288 --> 0:0:47,176
That's all you've got to do.


18
0:0:47,176 --> 0:0:49,0
SHIRLEY PHELPS-ROPER: This
generation teaches their


19
0:0:49,0 --> 0:0:52,4
children it is in fact
OK to be gay.


20
0:0:52,4 --> 0:0:53,65
That is a lie.


21
0:0:53,65 --> 0:0:57,5



22
0:0:57,5 --> 0:1:1,7
STEVE DRAIN: It's amazing how
much Bible a little child can


23
0:1:1,7 --> 0:1:3,4
know and retain.


24
0:1:3,4 --> 0:1:4,739
LIBBY (PHELPS) ALVAREZ: All we
ever knew growing up, all we


25
0:1:4,739 --> 0:1:8,9
ever talked about, was the
ministry of the WBC.


26
0:1:8,9 --> 0:1:10,82
And they expect everyone to
bow down and do everything


27
0:1:10,82 --> 0:1:12,26
they want them to do.


28
0:1:12,26 --> 0:1:20,42



29
0:1:20,42 --> 0:1:22,72
FRED PHELPS: Do your worst!


30
0:1:22,72 --> 0:1:23,79
I dare you!


31
0:1:23,79 --> 0:1:25,4
Try to stop us!


32
0:1:25,4 --> 0:1:39,9



33
0:1:39,9 --> 0:1:42,82
MALE SPEAKER: Westboro Baptist
Church of Topeka, Kansas


34
0:1:42,82 --> 0:1:45,662
presents the Old School
Baptist Hour


35
0:1:45,662 --> 0:1:48,31
with Pastor Fred Phelps.


36
0:1:48,31 --> 0:1:50,52
FRED PHELPS: This
is Fred Phelps.


37
0:1:50,52 --> 0:1:54,33
Westboro Baptist Church of
Topeka is an Old School or


38
0:1:54,33 --> 0:1:57,13
Primitive Baptist Church.


39
0:1:57,13 --> 0:2:0,46
Many people nowadays do not
know what an Old School or


40
0:2:0,46 --> 0:2:5,4
Primitive Baptist is, but in
early America, they abounded


41
0:2:5,4 --> 0:2:7,45
and were well known.


42
0:2:7,45 --> 0:2:11,4
John Leland, who, with James
Madison, drafted the First


43
0:2:11,4 --> 0:2:13,71
Amendment to the Constitution,
was a


44
0:2:13,71 --> 0:2:16,6
Primitive Baptist preacher.


45
0:2:16,6 --> 0:2:17,53
MALE SPEAKER: Through the years
that Vice has followed


46
0:2:17,53 --> 0:2:20,99
this story, no character stood
out more to us than the family


47
0:2:20,99 --> 0:2:23,3
of Steve Drain, the only
members of the Westboro


48
0:2:23,3 --> 0:2:25,83
Baptist Church not
related by blood.


49
0:2:25,83 --> 0:2:27,69
STEVE DRAIN: Came up here to
do a documentary film on


50
0:2:27,69 --> 0:2:28,37
Westboro Baptist Church.


51
0:2:28,37 --> 0:2:30,2
I always thought that
it would be an


52
0:2:30,2 --> 0:2:31,45
interesting subject matter.


53
0:2:31,45 --> 0:2:36,37
I went around one Thanksgiving
weekend knocking on doors.


54
0:2:36,37 --> 0:2:38,62
Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
Sunday, asking people what do


55
0:2:38,62 --> 0:2:40,31
you believe, and why
do you believe it?


56
0:2:40,31 --> 0:2:44,32
The overwhelming conclusion that
I was reaching was that


57
0:2:44,32 --> 0:2:46,56
people have no idea what they
believe and why they believe


58
0:2:46,56 --> 0:2:48,25
it, but they keep on
doing it anyway.


59
0:2:48,25 --> 0:2:50,82
MALE SPEAKER: 12 years ago,
Steve Drain was a 35-year-old


60
0:2:50,82 --> 0:2:53,62
aspiring filmmaker who wanted
to expose the Phelps and the


61
0:2:53,62 --> 0:2:57,6
Westboro Baptist congregation
as frauds, or as he put it,


62
0:2:57,6 --> 0:2:58,66
snake oil salesmen.


63
0:2:58,66 --> 0:2:59,65
STEVE DRAIN: So then I thought,
you know what?


64
0:2:59,65 --> 0:3:1,61
I'm going to go one step
further, and I'm going to ask


65
0:3:1,61 --> 0:3:4,59
the pastors, the men in charge,
the men of the cloth,


66
0:3:4,59 --> 0:3:5,45
so to speak.


67
0:3:5,45 --> 0:3:8,9
Now, what happened was I came
up here to start doing these


68
0:3:8,9 --> 0:3:10,24
interviews.


69
0:3:10,24 --> 0:3:11,33
They threw me a curveball.


70
0:3:11,33 --> 0:3:12,96
I was supposed to interview a
lot of other people and then


71
0:3:12,96 --> 0:3:14,85
work my way up to Gramps
and talk to him


72
0:3:14,85 --> 0:3:16,11
there toward the end.


73
0:3:16,11 --> 0:3:18,475
Well, when I was halfway between
here and Lawrence,


74
0:3:18,475 --> 0:3:20,79
driving over here for my first
day, they said Gramps


75
0:3:20,79 --> 0:3:22,3
wants to talk now.


76
0:3:22,3 --> 0:3:23,88
Pastor Phelps wants
to talk now.


77
0:3:23,88 --> 0:3:26,53
And I sat down with
him, and we only


78
0:3:26,53 --> 0:3:28,13
stopped to change tape.


79
0:3:28,13 --> 0:3:29,48
It was still mini-DVD
back then.


80
0:3:29,48 --> 0:3:31,4
Well, I talked to that
guy for four hours.


81
0:3:31,4 --> 0:3:33,15
That interview was
just so bad ass.


82
0:3:33,15 --> 0:3:37,42
I went back to Florida, and I
researched every answer that


83
0:3:37,42 --> 0:3:39,29
they gave for every single
thing that they gave.


84
0:3:39,29 --> 0:3:42,6
And this sounded like these guys
weren't going to give a


85
0:3:42,6 --> 0:3:43,28
false answer.


86
0:3:43,28 --> 0:3:44,7
It sounded like these
guys weren't going


87
0:3:44,7 --> 0:3:45,67
to pervert the scripture.


88
0:3:45,67 --> 0:3:47,78
That's in fact what it was.


89
0:3:47,78 --> 0:3:50,59
MALE SPEAKER: Fred Phelps was
born in 1929, in a small city


90
0:3:50,59 --> 0:3:52,84
of Meridian, Mississippi
to a railroad


91
0:3:52,84 --> 0:3:54,65
policeman and homemaker.


92
0:3:54,65 --> 0:3:56,79
After the untimely death of
his mother from cancer in


93
0:3:56,79 --> 0:3:59,63
1935, Fred was raised
by his great aunt.


94
0:3:59,63 --> 0:4:4,49



95
0:4:4,49 --> 0:4:6,13
FRED PHELPS: You want
to go to hell?


96
0:4:6,13 --> 0:4:8,959
No!


97
0:4:8,959 --> 0:4:10,45
Get real!


98
0:4:10,45 --> 0:4:12,4
MALE SPEAKER: After graduating
from high school, Phelps was


99
0:4:12,4 --> 0:4:13,97
accepted to the United
States Military


100
0:4:13,97 --> 0:4:15,42
Academy at West Point.


101
0:4:15,42 --> 0:4:18,329
However, after attending a
Methodist revival, he turned


102
0:4:18,329 --> 0:4:19,79
his attention to
the scripture.


103
0:4:19,79 --> 0:4:22,17
Over the next few years, Phelps
bounced around between


104
0:4:22,17 --> 0:4:25,84
several divinity schools until
in 1951, he met Margie M


105
0:4:25,84 --> 0:4:28,9
Simms, who he married
later that year.


106
0:4:28,9 --> 0:4:32,39
In 1964, Fred Phelps graduated
from law school at Washburn


107
0:4:32,39 --> 0:4:35,8
University in Topeka, Kansas,
where he settled with his


108
0:4:35,8 --> 0:4:38,27
growing family and founded the
Phelps chartered law firm.


109
0:4:38,27 --> 0:4:40,69
Over the course of the next
decade, he made quite a name


110
0:4:40,69 --> 0:4:42,71
for himself as a prominent
civil rights attorney.


111
0:4:42,71 --> 0:4:44,73
SHIRLEY PHELPS-ROPER: During the
civil rights movement, at


112
0:4:44,73 --> 0:4:47,56
KU, there were lots of sit-ins,
and those black


113
0:4:47,56 --> 0:4:48,67
students would be arrested.


114
0:4:48,67 --> 0:4:50,91
And there was a prosecutor over
in Douglas County that


115
0:4:50,91 --> 0:4:52,49
would prosecute them.


116
0:4:52,49 --> 0:4:55,29
So one of the first things my
dad did when he got out of law


117
0:4:55,29 --> 0:4:58,79
school was go over there and
defend those students.


118
0:4:58,79 --> 0:5:0,62
MALE SPEAKER: Phelps took cases
on behalf of African


119
0:5:0,62 --> 0:5:2,93
American clients alleging
racial discrimination by


120
0:5:2,93 --> 0:5:5,59
school districts, racially-based
police abuse,


121
0:5:5,59 --> 0:5:7,76
and unconstitutional raids
on African American


122
0:5:7,76 --> 0:5:8,83
establishments.


123
0:5:8,83 --> 0:5:10,768
FRED PHELPS: They couldn't get
a white lawyer to go to


124
0:5:10,768 --> 0:5:13,0
Lawrence and defend
Gale Sayers and


125
0:5:13,0 --> 0:5:15,19
those 102 black students.


126
0:5:15,19 --> 0:5:16,86
So they came to me.


127
0:5:16,86 --> 0:5:21,36
God Almighty, you understand,
never said it's an abomination


128
0:5:21,36 --> 0:5:22,9
to be black.


129
0:5:22,9 --> 0:5:25,98
KATHERINE PHELPS: Their rights
were at stake, and he didn't


130
0:5:25,98 --> 0:5:28,44
care they didn't
have the money.


131
0:5:28,44 --> 0:5:31,52
He took the time to represent
their voice.


132
0:5:31,52 --> 0:5:33,445
FEMALE SPEAKER: Fred Phelps is
good at raising Cain in the


133
0:5:33,445 --> 0:5:35,49
courtroom and just about
everywhere else.


134
0:5:35,49 --> 0:5:38,21
It's earned him the wrath of
some, the respect of others.


135
0:5:38,21 --> 0:5:41,2



136
0:5:41,2 --> 0:5:43,1
STEVE DRAIN: This
is a humble man.


137
0:5:43,1 --> 0:5:46,835
This is a bright, a very bright
man, who, if he would


138
0:5:46,835 --> 0:5:49,67
have embraced the world rather
than humbled himself to the


139
0:5:49,67 --> 0:5:52,49
scripture, I guarantee he would
at least be on a federal


140
0:5:52,49 --> 0:5:54,47
court bench somewhere, if
not the Supreme Court.


141
0:5:54,47 --> 0:5:56,34
I mean, this guy's a
really smart guy.


142
0:5:56,34 --> 0:5:58,97
MALE SPEAKER: In 1977, a formal
complaint was filed


143
0:5:58,97 --> 0:6:1,91
against Phelps by the Kansas
State Board of Law Examiners


144
0:6:1,91 --> 0:6:3,59
for his conduct during
a lawsuit against a


145
0:6:3,59 --> 0:6:5,6
Kansas court reporter.


146
0:6:5,6 --> 0:6:8,41
During the trial, he brutally
cross-examined her for a week


147
0:6:8,41 --> 0:6:11,89
and accused her of a variety
of perverse sexual acts,


148
0:6:11,89 --> 0:6:14,62
ultimately reducing her
to tears on the stand.


149
0:6:14,62 --> 0:6:16,84
Phelps prepared affidavits
swearing to the court that he


150
0:6:16,84 --> 0:6:19,31
had eight witnesses whose
testimony would convince the


151
0:6:19,31 --> 0:6:21,23
court to rule in his favor.


152
0:6:21,23 --> 0:6:23,88
The court reporter, in turn,
obtained sworn signed


153
0:6:23,88 --> 0:6:26,48
affidavits from the eight people
in question, all of


154
0:6:26,48 --> 0:6:29,13
whom said that Phelps had never
contacted them, and they


155
0:6:29,13 --> 0:6:31,46
had no reason to testify
against her.


156
0:6:31,46 --> 0:6:35,62
Phelps had committed perjury,
and on July 20, 1979, was


157
0:6:35,62 --> 0:6:37,47
permanently disbarred from
practicing law in


158
0:6:37,47 --> 0:6:38,72
the state of Kansas.


159
0:6:38,72 --> 0:6:45,5



160
0:6:45,5 --> 0:6:47,13
LIBBY (PHELPS) ALVAREZ: We
started picketing at Gage Park


161
0:6:47,13 --> 0:6:51,33
because a couple of my cousins
were propositioned by


162
0:6:51,33 --> 0:6:52,28
homosexuals.


163
0:6:52,28 --> 0:6:54,84
FEMALE SPEAKER: At about 9:30, a
procession of vehicles would


164
0:6:54,84 --> 0:6:56,46
begin circling the park.


165
0:6:56,46 --> 0:6:59,89
People familiar with Gage say
they see the same cars night


166
0:6:59,89 --> 0:7:1,9
after night.


167
0:7:1,9 --> 0:7:2,5
LIBBY (PHELPS) ALVAREZ: We tried
to get the government


168
0:7:2,5 --> 0:7:7,3
bodies to clean up the park so
they weren't trying to get


169
0:7:7,3 --> 0:7:9,76
little children into the
bathrooms with them.


170
0:7:9,76 --> 0:7:14,33
And it didn't work, so
we started picketing.


171
0:7:14,33 --> 0:7:16,61
FRED PHELPS: It wouldn't take
much, we thought, to drive


172
0:7:16,61 --> 0:7:20,11
those openly promiscuous
homosexuals out of Gage Park.


173
0:7:20,11 --> 0:7:22,24
Boy, were we wrong.


174
0:7:22,24 --> 0:7:24,43
LIBBY (PHELPS) ALVAREZ: We
would take out those big,


175
0:7:24,43 --> 0:7:26,7
rectangular, long brown
tables, and


176
0:7:26,7 --> 0:7:28,26
we would have picnics.


177
0:7:28,26 --> 0:7:30,48
The law was that you had
to walk in a circle.


178
0:7:30,48 --> 0:7:31,47
So we would do that.


179
0:7:31,47 --> 0:7:32,83
The grass would die.


180
0:7:32,83 --> 0:7:35,77
TIMOTHY PHELPS: The first big
sign that was made, I made it.


181
0:7:35,77 --> 0:7:37,55
And it said God hates gays.


182
0:7:37,55 --> 0:7:39,535
And it sure got attention.


183
0:7:39,535 --> 0:7:42,21
DENISE HALL: You know, it used
to just be here in Topeka.


184
0:7:42,21 --> 0:7:44,79
They would do all these things,
and they didn't get


185
0:7:44,79 --> 0:7:46,94
noticed much of any
place else.


186
0:7:46,94 --> 0:7:48,55
LIBBY (PHELPS) ALVAREZ: Remember
the fax [INAUDIBLE]?


187
0:7:48,55 --> 0:7:51,28
I'm surprised they didn't hand
deliver it before that.


188
0:7:51,28 --> 0:7:53,93
DENISE HALL: And they would send
out these horrific faxes


189
0:7:53,93 --> 0:7:57,58
about people, and if anybody
would say anything about them,


190
0:7:57,58 --> 0:8:0,5
they would send out more
faxes about people.


191
0:8:0,5 --> 0:8:1,89
And it got to be--


192
0:8:1,89 --> 0:8:4,96
in our office, when my husband
was alive, we'd get these


193
0:8:4,96 --> 0:8:8,13
faxes in, and he would just
turn around and fax


194
0:8:8,13 --> 0:8:9,34
them back to them.


195
0:8:9,34 --> 0:8:11,34
Then it got to the place where
they would shut off their fax


196
0:8:11,34 --> 0:8:14,2
machine when they would
send these faxes out.


197
0:8:14,2 --> 0:8:15,62
And he'd try to fax them back,
and they'd turn the fax


198
0:8:15,62 --> 0:8:16,24
machine off.


199
0:8:16,24 --> 0:8:17,76
So then we couldn't
fax them back.


200
0:8:17,76 --> 0:8:19,7
TIM PHELPS: Yeah, they sent
out underground picket


201
0:8:19,7 --> 0:8:21,55
schedule, weekly picket
schedule.


202
0:8:21,55 --> 0:8:24,53
And at my house, they would
print it off and post it in


203
0:8:24,53 --> 0:8:25,42
the kitchen.


204
0:8:25,42 --> 0:8:28,0
You knew where you had to be,
if you were supposed to go,


205
0:8:28,0 --> 0:8:30,31
and whatnot.


206
0:8:30,31 --> 0:8:33,99
FRED PHELPS: I would that free
grace were more preached


207
0:8:33,99 --> 0:8:38,169
because it gives men something
to believe with confidence.


208
0:8:38,169 --> 0:8:40,309
The great mass of professing
Christians


209
0:8:40,309 --> 0:8:42,429
know nothing of doctrine.


210
0:8:42,429 --> 0:8:45,79
Their religion consists in
going a certain number of


211
0:8:45,79 --> 0:8:48,33
times to a place of worship.


212
0:8:48,33 --> 0:8:52,9
But they have no care for truth
one way or another.


213
0:8:52,9 --> 0:8:56,14
I speak without any prejudice
in this matter.


214
0:8:56,14 --> 0:8:58,57
TIM PHELPS: 2004, 2005, it's
right where it's hitting big


215
0:8:58,57 --> 0:9:1,8
on God hates America.


216
0:9:1,8 --> 0:9:3,76
No 4th of July, none
of the other stuff


217
0:9:3,76 --> 0:9:4,85
that we used to do.


218
0:9:4,85 --> 0:9:5,74
LIBBY (PHELPS) ALVAREZ: Then
they started ramping up with


219
0:9:5,74 --> 0:9:7,75
the military, and the picketing
the funerals, and


220
0:9:7,75 --> 0:9:8,48
things like that.


221
0:9:8,48 --> 0:9:10,2
Everything started ramping
up and getting


222
0:9:10,2 --> 0:9:11,61
more and more extreme.


223
0:9:11,61 --> 0:9:14,3
MALE SPEAKER: In 2006, Westboro
organized a picket at


224
0:9:14,3 --> 0:9:17,17
the Westminster, Maryland
funeral of Matthew Snyder, the


225
0:9:17,17 --> 0:9:19,56
US Marine who was killed in
Iraq, featuring banners


226
0:9:19,56 --> 0:9:21,89
stating thank God for
dead soldiers.


227
0:9:21,89 --> 0:9:24,27
They soon found themselves back
in court when a lawsuit


228
0:9:24,27 --> 0:9:27,18
was filed shortly after by
Albert Snyder, the deceased


229
0:9:27,18 --> 0:9:28,14
Marine's father.


230
0:9:28,14 --> 0:9:31,14
Snyder won a $10.9 million
judgment against the Westboro


231
0:9:31,14 --> 0:9:32,55
Baptist Church.


232
0:9:32,55 --> 0:9:35,5
FEMALE SPEAKER: We thank
God for the $10.9.


233
0:9:35,5 --> 0:9:35,736
FEMALE SPEAKER: The $10.9.


234
0:9:35,736 --> 0:9:36,883
FEMALE SPEAKER: The
$10.9 million.


235
0:9:36,883 --> 0:9:41,5
CHILDREN: Thank God
for $10.9 million.


236
0:9:41,5 --> 0:9:43,98
FEMALE SPEAKER: I thank God for
the $10.9 million verdict


237
0:9:43,98 --> 0:9:46,8
because it's a small price to
pay to get this message,


238
0:9:46,8 --> 0:9:49,74
America is doomed, in front of
the eyes of whole world.


239
0:9:49,74 --> 0:9:53,1
You can't pay for worldwide
publicity that cheap.


240
0:9:53,1 --> 0:9:55,95
MALE SPEAKER: The Snyder
lawsuit, if your appeals are


241
0:9:55,95 --> 0:9:59,32
exhausted, will you willingly
pay the damages?


242
0:9:59,32 --> 0:10:0,18
SHIRLEY PHELPS-ROPER: No.


243
0:10:0,18 --> 0:10:0,48
No.


244
0:10:0,48 --> 0:10:2,79
Here's what you need to do.


245
0:10:2,79 --> 0:10:4,82
You need to forget
that lawsuit.


246
0:10:4,82 --> 0:10:6,99
That lawsuit has a purpose.


247
0:10:6,99 --> 0:10:10,67
This nation intended it unto us
for evil, but God intends


248
0:10:10,67 --> 0:10:13,18
it unto us for good.


249
0:10:13,18 --> 0:10:16,55
MALE SPEAKER: In 2011, the US
Supreme Court decided eight to


250
0:10:16,55 --> 0:10:19,63
one that Westboro's actions
constituted protected free


251
0:10:19,63 --> 0:10:21,86
speech, and the judgment
was overturned.


252
0:10:21,86 --> 0:10:24,8
Albert Snyder was later ordered
to pay Westboro's


253
0:10:24,8 --> 0:10:25,702
legal costs.


254
0:10:25,702 --> 0:10:27,4
SHIRLEY PHELPS-ROPER: If it
wasn't for the fact that I


255
0:10:27,4 --> 0:10:29,23
believe every word of those
scriptures and I know


256
0:10:29,23 --> 0:10:33,603
everything that our God does
is proper and perfect and


257
0:10:33,603 --> 0:10:37,28
righteous, I'd almost feel
sorry for those people.


258
0:10:37,28 --> 0:10:41,51
FEMALE SPEAKER: Recorded
yesterday at 5:06.


259
0:10:41,51 --> 0:10:43,436
MALE SPEAKER: You fucking piece
of shit cocksuckers.


260
0:10:43,436 --> 0:10:45,889
I don't give a fuck if you're
a bunch of lawyers or not.


261
0:10:45,889 --> 0:10:49,19
I'm telling you now, the next
time I hear of you desecrating


262
0:10:49,19 --> 0:10:53,62
a soldier, the whole lot of you
are going to fucking die.


263
0:10:53,62 --> 0:10:56,98
I'll fucking stick a bomb in
every fucking house you own.


264
0:10:56,98 --> 0:11:0,115
I'll fucking blow up the law
office, and I'll fucking cut


265
0:11:0,115 --> 0:11:2,775
your fucking neck,
Fred Phelps.


266
0:11:2,775 --> 0:11:6,21



267
0:11:6,21 --> 0:11:7,46
MALE SPEAKER: It was during
the editing of his


268
0:11:7,46 --> 0:11:9,93
documentary, "Hatemongers" that
Steve claims he underwent


269
0:11:9,93 --> 0:11:11,68
a supernatural conversion.


270
0:11:11,68 --> 0:11:14,43
After much thought,
contemplation, and discussions


271
0:11:14,43 --> 0:11:17,24
with his wife Luci, Steve packed
up his two daughters,


272
0:11:17,24 --> 0:11:21,19
Taylor and Lauren, and moved the
family to Topeka, Kansas.


273
0:11:21,19 --> 0:11:22,42
STEVE DRAIN: They
both play piano.


274
0:11:22,42 --> 0:11:26,55
The banjo and cool hat's
cooler for pictures.


275
0:11:26,55 --> 0:11:28,35
She's starting to play
a little guitar.


276
0:11:28,35 --> 0:11:29,6
I play guitar.


277
0:11:29,6 --> 0:11:38,43



278
0:11:38,43 --> 0:11:41,98
When we bought this house, it
was in pretty rough shape, but


279
0:11:41,98 --> 0:11:43,27
the location was great.


280
0:11:43,27 --> 0:11:45,38
So you know, we wanted
to be by the church.


281
0:11:45,38 --> 0:11:48,37
So little by little, we've
changed it up.


282
0:11:48,37 --> 0:11:50,12
We like to kind of keep
it kind of colorful.


283
0:11:50,12 --> 0:11:53,23
We've got our little signs
of the times deal there.


284
0:11:53,23 --> 0:11:57,14
We went to Sundance Film
Festival in Utah, and we were


285
0:11:57,14 --> 0:12:1,47
picketing Kevin Smith, "Red
State." At Sundance, when we


286
0:12:1,47 --> 0:12:5,84
were over there fussing at
Kevin Smith, I told those


287
0:12:5,84 --> 0:12:8,1
fags-- they came over there--
and I told those fags, because


288
0:12:8,1 --> 0:12:11,71
they were asking me mockingly,
how do I go to heaven, Steve?


289
0:12:11,71 --> 0:12:16,42
I said, take a piece of barbed
wire, could be sharp, could be


290
0:12:16,42 --> 0:12:20,16
rusted, I don't care, and
lop your junk off.


291
0:12:20,16 --> 0:12:21,25
Do a lot of editing in there.


292
0:12:21,25 --> 0:12:22,68
Do a lot of the website
work in there.


293
0:12:22,68 --> 0:12:23,95
It's kind of messy.


294
0:12:23,95 --> 0:12:25,11
And the living room here.


295
0:12:25,11 --> 0:12:27,34
Matter of fact, last time Louis
Theroux was here, this


296
0:12:27,34 --> 0:12:32,19
is where I showed Louis Theroux
the really bad Jew


297
0:12:32,19 --> 0:12:36,18
parody video with the guys with
the little [INAUDIBLE].


298
0:12:36,18 --> 0:12:38,64
You never saw that?


299
0:12:38,64 --> 0:12:39,89
Two Jews fighting
over a penny.


300
0:12:39,89 --> 0:12:49,7



301
0:12:49,7 --> 0:12:52,5
Got to do something.


302
0:12:52,5 --> 0:12:53,3
Check this out.


303
0:12:53,3 --> 0:12:55,65



304
0:12:55,65 --> 0:12:56,87
MALE SPEAKER: All right,
welcome back.


305
0:12:56,87 --> 0:13:0,3
So now, joining us live via
satellite, [INAUDIBLE].


306
0:13:0,3 --> 0:13:2,38
MALE SPEAKER: I'm real sorry
about what happened to your


307
0:13:2,38 --> 0:13:5,745
son, Mr. Snyder, and I
assure you, God had


308
0:13:5,745 --> 0:13:7,4
nothing to do with it.


309
0:13:7,4 --> 0:13:10,25



310
0:13:10,25 --> 0:13:11,98
JOE STRAMOWSKI: Your Joel Osteen
kinda sounds like a


311
0:13:11,98 --> 0:13:13,22
George W Bush.


312
0:13:13,22 --> 0:13:15,272
STEVE DRAIN: I know.


313
0:13:15,272 --> 0:13:17,58
I just use what I got, dude.


314
0:13:17,58 --> 0:13:19,78
JOE STRAMOWSKI: It's a
good George W Bush.


315
0:13:19,78 --> 0:13:21,82
MALE SPEAKER: Since making his
profession of faith and


316
0:13:21,82 --> 0:13:24,87
accepting Baptism into the
Westboro Baptist church fold,


317
0:13:24,87 --> 0:13:27,97
Steve has since become its
Public Information Officer,


318
0:13:27,97 --> 0:13:32,232
basically its propaganda
minister in chief.


319
0:13:32,232 --> 0:13:32,592
MALE SPEAKER: [SINGING]


320
0:13:32,592 --> 0:13:37,545
Shame taught your children
God's a liar.


321
0:13:37,545 --> 0:13:39,48
Shame made [INAUDIBLE]


322
0:13:39,48 --> 0:13:41,49
STEVE DRAIN: Well, the
way we do it is


323
0:13:41,49 --> 0:13:42,9
we're writing parodies.


324
0:13:42,9 --> 0:13:46,63
So we're trying to replace those
lyrics with lyrics that


325
0:13:46,63 --> 0:13:48,33
are Biblically sound.


326
0:13:48,33 --> 0:13:51,87
Of course, it has
to fit a hook.


327
0:13:51,87 --> 0:13:52,25
FEMALE SPEAKER: Check
them out now.


328
0:13:52,25 --> 0:13:52,574
FEMALE SPEAKER: [SINGING]


329
0:13:52,574 --> 0:13:54,786
Pimpin' on your G-O-D.


330
0:13:54,786 --> 0:13:55,68
FEMALE SPEAKER: [SINGING]


331
0:13:55,68 --> 0:13:59,854
God's gonna stand there
and watch you burn.


332
0:13:59,854 --> 0:14:5,255
But that's all right because
you wouldn't heed His word.


333
0:14:5,255 --> 0:14:9,68



334
0:14:9,68 --> 0:14:12,48
STEVE DRAIN: When we make our
choices of songs, that really


335
0:14:12,48 --> 0:14:14,89
revolves around mostly
popularity.


336
0:14:14,89 --> 0:14:17,3
It's mostly mainstream stuff.


337
0:14:17,3 --> 0:14:20,65
The whole idea of our doing
parodies is to preach.


338
0:14:20,65 --> 0:14:24,71
So we're trying to get as many
ears on songs, as many eyes on


339
0:14:24,71 --> 0:14:26,2
videos as possible.


340
0:14:26,2 --> 0:14:29,96
Well, we have the Feel Good
Inc. We did Fear God.


341
0:14:29,96 --> 0:14:30,221
MALE SPEAKER: [SINGING]


342
0:14:30,221 --> 0:14:30,66
Don't stop.


343
0:14:30,66 --> 0:14:31,9
Get it.


344
0:14:31,9 --> 0:14:31,93
Get it.


345
0:14:31,93 --> 0:14:33,4
It's only [INAUDIBLE]


346
0:14:33,4 --> 0:14:34,78
Watch as God annihilates.


347
0:14:34,78 --> 0:14:38,1
Ha ha ha ha ha.


348
0:14:38,1 --> 0:14:39,7
STEVE DRAIN: Sometimes a
classic thing like the


349
0:14:39,7 --> 0:14:40,66
Beatles, you know.


350
0:14:40,66 --> 0:14:41,16
MALE SPEAKER:
[SINGING] [INAUDIBLE]


351
0:14:41,16 --> 0:14:42,66
the Jews.


352
0:14:42,66 --> 0:14:43,91
[INAUDIBLE] the Jews.


353
0:14:43,91 --> 0:14:46,16



354
0:14:46,16 --> 0:14:48,7
STEVE DRAIN: We did Michael
Jackson for a little while


355
0:14:48,7 --> 0:14:49,35
around the time that he died.


356
0:14:49,35 --> 0:14:50,6
That was kind of a big thing.


357
0:14:50,6 --> 0:15:0,8



358
0:15:0,8 --> 0:15:3,48
Most of what people got mad at
us for was we were using


359
0:15:3,48 --> 0:15:11,22
"Thriller" dance moves for "Beat
It" and "Bad" parodies.


360
0:15:11,22 --> 0:15:13,92
It's just, that's kind of
a cool thing to do.


361
0:15:13,92 --> 0:15:15,82
So they were like chasing
us for that.


362
0:15:15,82 --> 0:15:16,75
We were like, really?


363
0:15:16,75 --> 0:15:18,995
Yeah, we know that.


364
0:15:18,995 --> 0:15:21,6
FRED PHELPS: You taught these
kids from the time they


365
0:15:21,6 --> 0:15:24,98
started school that
it's OK to be gay.


366
0:15:24,98 --> 0:15:27,74
So therefore, you busted
their moral compass.


367
0:15:27,74 --> 0:15:33,65
The same God that said thou
shall not kill said thou shall


368
0:15:33,65 --> 0:15:37,6
not lie with mankind as a
womankind, and affixed the


369
0:15:37,6 --> 0:15:40,44
death penalty for both sins.


370
0:15:40,44 --> 0:15:43,51
And you taught them that God
didn't mean what he said about


371
0:15:43,51 --> 0:15:46,29
one, so if it's OK to be
gay, it's OK to kill.


372
0:15:46,29 --> 0:15:50,36



373
0:15:50,36 --> 0:15:51,88
STEVE DRAIN: Hey,
I got an idea.


374
0:15:51,88 --> 0:15:54,66
Let's rip the babies out of
the wombs of these fool


375
0:15:54,66 --> 0:15:58,48
American women on the back
of their fornication.


376
0:15:58,48 --> 0:16:1,81
And then let's break the moral
compasses of the kids that do


377
0:16:1,81 --> 0:16:4,843
end up getting born, raise them
up for the devil, and


378
0:16:4,843 --> 0:16:7,0
then hand them a gun and go send
them off to fight bloody


379
0:16:7,0 --> 0:16:9,13
wars that we have no business
fighting in the first place,


380
0:16:9,13 --> 0:16:10,7
and we certainly can't win.


381
0:16:10,7 --> 0:16:13,2
SHIRLEY PHELPS-ROPER: You sit
them in your homes, in your


382
0:16:13,2 --> 0:16:17,77
classrooms, in your so-called
churches, and you teach them


383
0:16:17,77 --> 0:16:20,79
rebellion against the
standards of God.


384
0:16:20,79 --> 0:16:22,81
STEVE DRAIN: Look, when we take
these kids out on these


385
0:16:22,81 --> 0:16:26,65
picket lines, they see
the difference.


386
0:16:26,65 --> 0:16:29,16
The mind starts working
pretty early.


387
0:16:29,16 --> 0:16:32,21
They see the difference between
the way we conduct


388
0:16:32,21 --> 0:16:35,32
ourselves and how we cleave
to the scripture.


389
0:16:35,32 --> 0:16:36,67
We're sinners like
anybody else.


390
0:16:36,67 --> 0:16:38,9
But the main difference between
God's elect and the


391
0:16:38,9 --> 0:16:40,58
reprobate is we're ashamed
of our sin.


392
0:16:40,58 --> 0:16:41,38
We're not proud of it.


393
0:16:41,38 --> 0:16:42,26
We don't want to continue it.


394
0:16:42,26 --> 0:16:43,72
We want to stop it.


395
0:16:43,72 --> 0:16:45,5
SHIRLEY PHELPS-ROPER: This
generation has taught these


396
0:16:45,5 --> 0:16:51,23
children it is in fact OK to
have sex early, often, with


397
0:16:51,23 --> 0:16:55,54
anyone you want to, or any
animal that you want to.


398
0:16:55,54 --> 0:16:58,47
There is special anger from
God about what you do with


399
0:16:58,47 --> 0:17:0,48
your children because
the scripture


400
0:17:0,48 --> 0:17:3,38
says they know nothing.


401
0:17:3,38 --> 0:17:7,23
FRED PHELPS: And all such gifts
as accompany salvation


402
0:17:7,23 --> 0:17:11,25
are reserved by that same
sovereign God for


403
0:17:11,25 --> 0:17:13,65
his sheep, his elect.


404
0:17:13,65 --> 0:17:19,929



405
0:17:19,929 --> 0:17:21,78
MALE SPEAKER: Shouldn't they
have the chance to decide


406
0:17:21,78 --> 0:17:24,79
first, before they're
out here?


407
0:17:24,79 --> 0:17:25,54
REBEKAH PHELPS-DAVIS:
That's like saying--


408
0:17:25,54 --> 0:17:27,64
that's like if you were to ask
me, shouldn't they have a


409
0:17:27,64 --> 0:17:32,68
right to decide whether they
should go to school and learn


410
0:17:32,68 --> 0:17:36,62
before you send them
to school to learn?


411
0:17:36,62 --> 0:17:38,13
I mean, this is more important
even than that.


412
0:17:38,13 --> 0:17:41,1



413
0:17:41,1 --> 0:17:42,73
MALE SPEAKER: Any one of these
children, when they're a


414
0:17:42,73 --> 0:17:45,73
little bit older, if they
decide that this is not


415
0:17:45,73 --> 0:17:47,2
something that they want
to be a part of, will


416
0:17:47,2 --> 0:17:48,33
they still be allowed--


417
0:17:48,33 --> 0:17:50,0
are they still going to be a
member of these families, a


418
0:17:50,0 --> 0:17:51,7
member of this community?


419
0:17:51,7 --> 0:17:52,56
REBEKAH PHELPS-DAVIS: Don't you
understand that if they do


420
0:17:52,56 --> 0:17:57,61
not believe this message that
the Lord our God has given us,


421
0:17:57,61 --> 0:18:1,2
there isn't going to be a
discussion about how can I


422
0:18:1,2 --> 0:18:3,73
stay, even if I don't believe
the way you do.


423
0:18:3,73 --> 0:18:7,6
They will naturally go.


424
0:18:7,6 --> 0:18:8,31
They will just go.


425
0:18:8,31 --> 0:18:12,65



426
0:18:12,65 --> 0:18:15,83
LIBBY (PHELPS) ALVAREZ: I was
there for almost 26 years.


427
0:18:15,83 --> 0:18:18,21
I left a month before
my 26th birthday.


428
0:18:18,21 --> 0:18:21,15
And talking about childhood,
we started picketing when I


429
0:18:21,15 --> 0:18:23,46
was eight years old.


430
0:18:23,46 --> 0:18:24,926
We thought it was great.


431
0:18:24,926 --> 0:18:30,6



432
0:18:30,6 --> 0:18:33,11
FEMALE SPEAKER: I just want the
American public to know


433
0:18:33,11 --> 0:18:35,8
that with Barack Obama as your
president, he's going to lead


434
0:18:35,8 --> 0:18:37,45
this nation to its final
destruction.


435
0:18:37,45 --> 0:18:44,45



436
0:18:44,45 --> 0:18:45,69
STEVE DRAIN: We understand
it's not like


437
0:18:45,69 --> 0:18:47,6
you flip the switch.


438
0:18:47,6 --> 0:18:49,67
It's not like you prepare the
kids, prepare the kids,


439
0:18:49,67 --> 0:18:51,72
prepare the kids, and then
it happens to them.


440
0:18:51,72 --> 0:18:53,23
It's happening to
them all along.


441
0:18:53,23 --> 0:18:55,77
I mean, these kids go to the
elementary school, and they're


442
0:18:55,77 --> 0:18:57,35
thought of as walking
picket signs.


443
0:18:57,35 --> 0:18:58,85
LIBBY (PHELPS) ALVAREZ: Yeah,
because we're supposed to be a


444
0:18:58,85 --> 0:19:1,75
testament to the other
kids in there.


445
0:19:1,75 --> 0:19:4,51
Every time anybody looked at us,
all they would be thinking


446
0:19:4,51 --> 0:19:5,95
is God hates fags.


447
0:19:5,95 --> 0:19:6,7
TIM PHELPS: That word, yeah.


448
0:19:6,7 --> 0:19:7,2
Those words.


449
0:19:7,2 --> 0:19:8,3
LIBBY (PHELPS) ALVAREZ: And
you're going to hell.


450
0:19:8,3 --> 0:19:11,1
Because you have to do
everything that they want.


451
0:19:11,1 --> 0:19:12,53
They have absolute control
over everything.


452
0:19:12,53 --> 0:19:14,96
And if you don't do what
they want, then


453
0:19:14,96 --> 0:19:16,86
you are out of there.


454
0:19:16,86 --> 0:19:20,33
Whenever somebody gets
in trouble, we can't


455
0:19:20,33 --> 0:19:22,32
talk to them at all.


456
0:19:22,32 --> 0:19:23,75
TIM PHELPS: It's
like isolation.


457
0:19:23,75 --> 0:19:24,1
LIBBY (PHELPS) ALVAREZ: Yeah.


458
0:19:24,1 --> 0:19:25,77
It's ridiculous.


459
0:19:25,77 --> 0:19:27,1
STEVE DRAIN: Well,
I mean, they'll


460
0:19:27,1 --> 0:19:27,97
definitely question things.


461
0:19:27,97 --> 0:19:29,59
Any kid will question things.


462
0:19:29,59 --> 0:19:31,39
But your job is to raise
somebody in the nurturing


463
0:19:31,39 --> 0:19:32,73
[INAUDIBLE] the Lord.


464
0:19:32,73 --> 0:19:35,8
There's a big difference, Joe,
between questioning things,


465
0:19:35,8 --> 0:19:41,72
the natural inquisitive nature,
versus doing that from


466
0:19:41,72 --> 0:19:43,36
a Bible perspective.


467
0:19:43,36 --> 0:19:46,17
TIM PHELPS: The expectations
for us were higher, or were


468
0:19:46,17 --> 0:19:49,67
really high for grades and
how you act in school.


469
0:19:49,67 --> 0:19:54,17
And so that also is you're the
walking picket sign for those


470
0:19:54,17 --> 0:19:58,77
words, along with this perfect
student child.


471
0:19:58,77 --> 0:19:59,7
LIBBY (PHELPS) ALVAREZ:
Oh, yeah.


472
0:19:59,7 --> 0:19:59,48
Exactly.


473
0:19:59,48 --> 0:20:0,7
That's definitely it.


474
0:20:0,7 --> 0:20:4,1
Yeah, they wanted people
to hate us.


475
0:20:4,1 --> 0:20:5,82
And we were told that everyone
was going to hate us.


476
0:20:5,82 --> 0:20:8,4
And if anyone acted like
they were our friends--


477
0:20:8,4 --> 0:20:9,23
TIM PHELPS: They were lying.


478
0:20:9,23 --> 0:20:10,63
LIBBY (PHELPS) ALVAREZ:
Yeah, exactly.


479
0:20:10,63 --> 0:20:14,2
In their heart, they
really hate us.


480
0:20:14,2 --> 0:20:16,24
In the back of my mind, I'd
always be worried about what


481
0:20:16,24 --> 0:20:18,95
my family thought.


482
0:20:18,95 --> 0:20:22,175
Like if I got put on the news,
I would worry about what they


483
0:20:22,175 --> 0:20:25,44
would think I was saying,
and try to please them.


484
0:20:25,44 --> 0:20:27,575
If there was a car ride, or if
we were on an airplane, we


485
0:20:27,575 --> 0:20:29,84
would talk about why we were
picketing somewhere.


486
0:20:29,84 --> 0:20:31,97
So we would all have the same
answer because they were real


487
0:20:31,97 --> 0:20:35,29
big on everyone's of one
mind and one accord.


488
0:20:35,29 --> 0:20:37,53
So we all have to say
the same thing.


489
0:20:37,53 --> 0:20:40,23
STEVE DRAIN: Let's just take a
broad view of America from a


490
0:20:40,23 --> 0:20:42,134
Bible perspective.


491
0:20:42,134 --> 0:20:44,38
TAYLOR DRAIN: All of these
things that are happening


492
0:20:44,38 --> 0:20:46,42
today, all these shootings,
they're from God's hand.


493
0:20:46,42 --> 0:20:47,5
SHIRLEY PHELPS-ROPER: God
sent the shooters.


494
0:20:47,5 --> 0:20:50,9
MARGE PHELPS: So now there's
been a rash of shooters.


495
0:20:50,9 --> 0:20:52,73
STEVE DRAIN: God says, thou
shall not lie with--


496
0:20:52,73 --> 0:20:54,54
SHIRLEY PHELPS-ROPER: Mankind
as with womankind.


497
0:20:54,54 --> 0:20:56,4
FRED PHELPS: It is
an abomination.


498
0:20:56,4 --> 0:20:57,39
SHIRLEY PHELPS-ROPER:
Global warming.


499
0:20:57,39 --> 0:20:59,38
MARGE PHELPS: And hurricanes
and floods.


500
0:20:59,38 --> 0:21:1,6
STEVE DRAIN: God says no
divorce, no remarriage.


501
0:21:1,6 --> 0:21:2,93
SHIRLEY PHELPS-ROPER: You
are living in adultery.


502
0:21:2,93 --> 0:21:3,89
STEVE DRAIN: It's
OK to be gay.


503
0:21:3,89 --> 0:21:5,81
SHIRLEY PHELPS-ROPER: It is
in fact OK to be gay.


504
0:21:5,81 --> 0:21:8,97
We're entitled to do what we
want with our own bodies.


505
0:21:8,97 --> 0:21:10,93
MARGE PHELPS: That's like the
killer saying, I killed


506
0:21:10,93 --> 0:21:13,36
someone last night, but
God forgives me.


507
0:21:13,36 --> 0:21:15,882
I'm going to go kill someone
again tonight, but God


508
0:21:15,882 --> 0:21:16,27
forgives me.


509
0:21:16,27 --> 0:21:18,14
TIM PHELPS: And I know
with the little,


510
0:21:18,14 --> 0:21:21,6
younger kids, they would--


511
0:21:21,6 --> 0:21:22,26
what does this sign mean?


512
0:21:22,26 --> 0:21:24,42
And they would explain
it to them.


513
0:21:24,42 --> 0:21:27,18
And then so you have these even
younger kids who can just


514
0:21:27,18 --> 0:21:28,97
spit off these words that
they probably don't even


515
0:21:28,97 --> 0:21:30,94
understand.


516
0:21:30,94 --> 0:21:32,41
LIBBY (PHELPS) ALVAREZ: It
wasn't a very pleasant place


517
0:21:32,41 --> 0:21:35,7
to live, even though they act
like it's the most wonderful


518
0:21:35,7 --> 0:21:37,7
place on earth.


519
0:21:37,7 --> 0:21:39,48
TIM PHELPS: Well, to them
it probably is.


520
0:21:39,48 --> 0:21:42,58
LIBBY (PHELPS) ALVAREZ: That's
a little bit ridiculous.


521
0:21:42,58 --> 0:21:43,83
JOE STRAMOWSKI: Let's just
talk general politics.


522
0:21:43,83 --> 0:21:45,47
Who's your pick for November?


523
0:21:45,47 --> 0:21:48,2
STEVE DRAIN: Well, did you ever
see that "South Park"


524
0:21:48,2 --> 0:21:50,66
episode, "Giant Douche
and Turd Sandwich?"


525
0:21:50,66 --> 0:21:51,58
JOE STRAMOWSKI: Yes.


526
0:21:51,58 --> 0:21:53,46
STEVE DRAIN: That's what the
deal is because there really


527
0:21:53,46 --> 0:21:54,36
isn't a good choice.


528
0:21:54,36 --> 0:21:57,56
I mean, there wouldn't be any
Advocate magazine if a


529
0:21:57,56 --> 0:22:0,32
righteous man were leading
this nation.


530
0:22:0,32 --> 0:22:3,78
You would literally have to shut
down whole agencies of


531
0:22:3,78 --> 0:22:4,55
government.


532
0:22:4,55 --> 0:22:9,76
You wouldn't be able to promise
billions of dollars


533
0:22:9,76 --> 0:22:12,75
internationally to help fund
abortions, for instance.


534
0:22:12,75 --> 0:22:14,68
You wouldn't be able
to do that at all.


535
0:22:14,68 --> 0:22:18,92
You'd have to end
AIDS research.


536
0:22:18,92 --> 0:22:27,31
You'd have to re- institute
the death penalty for


537
0:22:27,31 --> 0:22:29,27
homosexuality.


538
0:22:29,27 --> 0:22:31,75
DENISE HALL: That's just
something that Fred can say


539
0:22:31,75 --> 0:22:34,22
that's so outlandish that he can
go, oh, I'm going to push


540
0:22:34,22 --> 0:22:36,11
somebody else's button.


541
0:22:36,11 --> 0:22:37,86
STEVE DRAIN: So that's why I
said to you a little earlier,


542
0:22:37,86 --> 0:22:39,62
I got a little eye raise
even out of you, Joe.


543
0:22:39,62 --> 0:22:41,51
You kind of have ice water in
your veins about stuff.


544
0:22:41,51 --> 0:22:43,79
But you even raised an eyebrow
when I said they'd have to


545
0:22:43,79 --> 0:22:45,68
re-institute the death
penalty for fags.


546
0:22:45,68 --> 0:22:46,93
That's what the Bible says.


547
0:22:46,93 --> 0:24:46,93
