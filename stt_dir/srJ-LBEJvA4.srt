"Man that's awesome. KG's got what he thinks
is part of the actual house Randall McCoy


2
0:0:15,54 --> 0:0:21,45
had here. He's got a square nail, some burnt
wood. So we decided, let's map this off. Let's


3
0:0:21,45 --> 0:0:28,21
figure out exactly what's going on here. Kind
of starting to peter out right here. Me too,


4
0:0:28,21 --> 0:0:34,78
it's almost like it shut off. I got perfect
hits all on this side, nothing on that side.


5
0:0:34,78 --> 0:0:39,64
Right here I start losing it. It's almost
like I got a straight line here and a straight


6
0:0:39,64 --> 0:0:43,44
line here. I wonder if it's like the corner.
We think it's the corner of the house so we


7
0:0:43,44 --> 0:0:48,82
decide to just rope it off. This is our chance
to do something gigantic. This isn't just


8
0:0:48,82 --> 0:1:0,739
any old foundation out in the woods. On a
site this important we're going to stop and


9
0:1:0,739 --> 0:1:6,45
call the Kentucky State archeologist and turn
the site over to them. We're here to do a


10
0:1:6,45 --> 0:1:12,35
preliminary assessment of the site. There's
already been preliminary metal detecting to


11
0:1:12,35 --> 0:1:17,939
locate concentrations of artifacts so now
we are beginning with very small excavation


12
0:1:17,939 --> 0:1:26,21
holes that we will use to understand the deposits
here. Here look at this. This is window glass


13
0:1:26,21 --> 0:1:30,729
and this is one of the artifacts that I'd
been hoping we'd find. This is as good as


14
0:1:30,729 --> 0:1:34,36
finding a piece of gold, you know we didn't
have to find this to prove it's a house but


15
0:1:34,36 --> 0:1:40,97
it's a great find. We have found some pretty
interesting evidence that we have the Randall
