###0 it seems like iran has always been the big bad
###3 but when it comes to north korea everyone's like on
###6 that they have nuclear weapons and a continued chance then
###9 but no one cares right so there's there's a little bit of a acting when it
###13 comes to some politicians they pretend to be a little concerned but when it
###17 comes to americans in general week i don't make fun of north korea out we
###22 don't really see that as a real threat at least not the moment but with iran
###26 there's always the sense of urgency all my doctor building nuclear weapons we
###30 have to do something called i got the uranium we gotta do something
###32 immediately
###33 so why
###34 is back in the atlantic did the job breaking this down and i just cannot
###38 wait to discuss this
###39 so i just give you guys are uh... some specific examples of
###43 how american politicians speak out about iran but don't care much about north
###47 korea
###47 in defense secretary timetables
###49 full-day confirmation hearing before the senate armed services committee but
###53 working robs mention one and one hundred seventy times
###57 north transmission ten times
###59 now remember iraq doesn't have nuclear weapons yet yeah north korean dots now
###63 of course that nuclear weapons that they have or their nuclear capabilities and
###67 all that impressive at the moment hubble we know that
###70 they have something that writing their back to me brand but they do have them
###74 they do not have exactly i'm part of the problem
###77 underwent distribuidora for it
###79 double legacy firstly as the the tensions between us and and uh... in
###83 north korea also between north korea south korean all that from the ratchet
###86 up in the past few weeks let me know
###88 at least of if read it is representative but it's just it's just jokes like he
###92 did on the main show couple days ago you did the picture of uh...
###96 uh... pins on uh...
###98 your own with the the pig nose and everything like yes it just seems so
###102 easy to market
###103 and it's because their culture is a little bit more foreign obviously
###106 they're their leaders are fit in such a different position than that they have a
###109 rich person it's easy to mark the lights also before we get into like asian
###112 stereotypes because that's actually part of this and i knew that it would be part
###116 of this let's discuss uh...
###118 here's some of the real issues with the wind
###121 love this explanation thing it's the best one so far with iran you'll have
###125 religious martyrs right so when you talk about nuclear war
###128 a lot of countries that have nuclear weapons will not engage in nuclear war
###133 because they know that that will be the demise of their own country
###136 offer instead of someone tax the united states of the nuclear weapon when you
###140 think the united states is going to bring in attacking you
###142 which our nuclear weapons so what you're on there more religious martyrs that
###147 might be
###148 willing to die in the name of the original in the name of their country
###152 with north korea they care much more about their state
###155 as opposed to anything else or or making sure to preserve their stay
###160 and you all know that there are three has been threatening us for a very long
###162 time this is not some new development
###165 so i love that explanation but then they also i kind of delved into on
###169 stereotypes so when it comes to moslems of course the stereotype is they're more
###175 danger as al you know that there is a
###177 and bill engaging riskier behavior whereas with occasions there seem isn't
###182 seen as worked in a and people don't generally think of them as a threat
###186 about sacred belief that by any way shape or form but you know that's
###190 just in general thinking behind it and i thought was interesting headed to some
###193 extent that's reflected in in popular culture like you see that who's the bad
###197 guy in the action movies changes over time infor
###200 herb the last fifteen years or so it's usually been muslims of some stripper
###203 data from one country doesn't matter which
###205 sometimes they're made up countries they will typically be the villain whereas
###209 north korea like they were one of the bond movies like it never dipping down
###212 that and i don't know if that causes some of what leads to us to fear around
###216 more than north korea or if it's simply a reflection of it
###218 but that's going on to the popular culture
###220 and also you know i keep in mind that we have the influence of israel israel is
###225 that you know very much willie are n_b_c_ claim that they're willing to
###229 that
###230 anti-tax iran if they do see iran is a threat and how many times as net neon
###234 set
###235 we're going to go in with an attack iran
###237 so that kind of makes the situation in iran a lot
###240 shakir
###241 uh... but another thing is and i i didn't know this story to recently
###246 north korea out that the state media north korea had reported that they found
###250 a unicorn lair
###252 uncovered that look if you're probably the first hour but if your
###256 it's telling your people that you discovered a unicorn layer
###261 you know if you're threatening us with nuclear weapons newman's contingency
###264 ears i don't even know if that's the craziest thing like he's only ever board
###268 three hundred any invented oral sex like there's a lot of crazy things that you
###272 know they do but if you're in for you
###281 but i think that you did touch on the biggest one like they've been listening
###284 this atlantic p several reasons that we fear run more than north korea but i
###288 think they israel's the most important part
###290 visiting like cuba real the average american who does not care much about
###294 any country in the world cares about america and israel and in both of these
###299 cases the country that we could potentially fear has a hostage to some
###302 extent iran has israel's hostage north korea even more directly as south korea
###306 as a hostage and that the average american for whatever reason just does
###310 not feel any connection to south korea for some raised the specter in in at
###315 incredible growth of u_n_ job christianity in south korea recently
###318 uh... i think that they just care more about israel
