Cup's main initiative


60
0:2:56,51 --> 0:3:1,47
is to try and create a program
for 13 to 17-year-old kids to

0:3:1,47 --> 0:3:4,33
be able to then step directly
into grand prix racing.


62

It's a program that, last
year, had kids from 14

0:3:7,33 --> 0:3:11,33

in eight different races.


64
0:3:11,33 --> 0:3:14,987
When I started racing in the mid
'80s, it was a set of my

0:3:14,987 --> 0:3:17,63
uncle's borrowed dirt track
leathers, and probably a


66
0:3:17,63 --> 0:3:20,36

right, and whatever boots I

strive to be if you want to be

but I'm trying


195
0:8:52,2 --> 0:8:53,1
to calm myself down.


196
0:8:53,1 --> 0:8:55,926
But before a race, if
I'm real calm, I


197
0:8:55,926 --> 0:8:56,88
normally don't do good.


198
0:8:56,88 --> 0:8:58,9
So I know it's a good sign
when I'm nervous.


199
0:8:58,9 --> 0:9:7,26



200
0:9:7,26 --> 0:9:10,605
I can do sometimes 50 to 100
laps 'cause it's pretty small.


201
0:9:10,605 --> 0:9:11,24
But it's a good work out.


202
0:9:11,24 --> 0:9:13,65
I like it.


203
0:9:13,65 --> 0:9:14,9
I play the video game a lot.


204
0:9:14,9 --> 0:9:16,98
I just like to know where the
track goes around, the


205
0:9:16,98 --> 0:9:19,396
configuration and what
turn comes up next.


206
0:9:19,396 --> 0:9:21,6
But the game doesn't help
much with anything,


207
0:9:21,6 --> 0:9:22,185
like bumps or anything.


208
0:9:22,185 --> 0:9:25,708
It's just the shape of the
track and all that.


209
0:9:25,708 --> 0:9:30,65



210
0:9:30,65 --> 0:9:31,74
ADRIANA SOLIS: When they ask
me, like, what kind of


211
0:9:31,74 --> 0:9:32,64
motorcycles?


212
0:9:32,64 --> 0:9:35,3
And I usually say the one
that drags the knee.


213
0:9:35,3 --> 0:9:36,78
And they're like really?


214
0:9:36,78 --> 0:9:37,77
Then I'm like, yeah.


215
0:9:37,77 --> 0:9:39,25
It's like, aren't you scared?


216
0:9:39,25 --> 0:9:39,595
Aren't you?


217
0:9:39,595 --> 0:9:40,81
Yes, I am.


218
0:9:40,81 --> 0:9:43,74
BEN SOLIS: I get scared, but
I've been there, and I know


219
0:9:43,74 --> 0:9:45,83
what Benny's feeling.


220
0:9:45,83 --> 0:9:50,93
And when you race, it's like
OK, crashes are normal.


221
0:9:50,93 --> 0:9:54,28
So when I see my boy crash,
and as long as he gets up


222
0:9:54,28 --> 0:9:57,94
right away or he's moving and
he's OK then I feel OK.


223
0:9:57,94 --> 0:10:0,28
ADRIANA SOLIS: I guess I
changed from fear to


224
0:10:0,28 --> 0:10:2,5
excitement.


225
0:10:2,5 --> 0:10:4,576
It's really exciting
to see him race.


226
0:10:4,576 --> 0:10:11,42



227
0:10:11,42 --> 0:10:13,33
BEN SOLIS: Sometimes we stretch
it to the limit, like


228
0:10:13,33 --> 0:10:16,4
OK we can't pay this bill
because we've got to go buy


229
0:10:16,4 --> 0:10:18,48
tires for the 125.


230
0:10:18,48 --> 0:10:21,39
So my wife kind of gets mad, and
she tells me, well you're


231
0:10:21,39 --> 0:10:22,3
not going to pay the
bill, you're going


232
0:10:22,3 --> 0:10:23,12
to buy him the tires?


233
0:10:23,12 --> 0:10:26,65
And I said well, we
got to go race.


234
0:10:26,65 --> 0:10:29,45
BENNY SOLIS: My mom and my dad
also support me because they


235
0:10:29,45 --> 0:10:33,968
work really hard to
help me do it.


236
0:10:33,968 --> 0:10:34,96
ADRIANA SOLIS: It's
what he wants.


237
0:10:34,96 --> 0:10:36,45
I have to support
him either way.


238
0:10:36,45 --> 0:10:38,55
Because if I was in his
position, he'd be doing the


239
0:10:38,55 --> 0:10:40,155
same for me, right?


240
0:10:40,155 --> 0:10:41,145
Right?


241
0:10:41,145 --> 0:10:45,61
[LAUGHTER]


242
0:10:45,61 --> 0:10:49,8
ADRIANA SOLIS: This is a gift
that God gave my son and he's


243
0:10:49,8 --> 0:10:51,98
putting all his energy
and effort to it.


244
0:10:51,98 --> 0:10:54,9
Now we need to be with him.


245
0:10:54,9 --> 0:10:54,71
BENNY SOLIS: We're
leaving tomorrow


246
0:10:54,71 --> 0:10:57,125
around 11, around there.


247
0:10:57,125 --> 0:11:1,59
And then we arrive Italy, in,
I think, the next day.


248
0:11:1,59 --> 0:11:4,7
ADRIANA SOLIS: I'm the one who
takes them to the airport.


249
0:11:4,7 --> 0:11:10,18
So I stay home nervous, waiting
for them to come back.


250
0:11:10,18 --> 0:11:11,23
BEN SOLIS: I got to think
about it like,


251
0:11:11,23 --> 0:11:13,47
is this really happening?


252
0:11:13,47 --> 0:11:15,14
So it's amazing.


253
0:11:15,14 --> 0:13:15,14
