1
0:0:1,17 --> 0:0:5,6
An ocean liner is a
totally enclosed system.


2
0:0:5,6 --> 0:0:9,28
It has medical, hospitals,
emergency rooms.


3
0:0:9,28 --> 0:0:13,7
but it has no kitchens in the bedrooms.
There's a dining area.


4
0:0:13,7 --> 0:0:18,9
It's inefficient to put a
kitchen in every bedroom


5
0:0:18,9 --> 0:0:21,1
on the ocean liner.
Do you understand that?


6
0:0:21,1 --> 0:0:23,95
They have areas set
aside for that.


7
0:0:23,95 --> 0:0:28,5
They have a nurse, several
nurses, on the ocean liner


8
0:0:28,5 --> 0:0:32,1
but what does a nurse do?
A nurse can bandage.


9
0:0:32,1 --> 0:0:34,51
She can close in surgery.


10
0:0:34,51 --> 0:0:37,6
There's no reason why


11
0:0:37,6 --> 0:0:41,49
the future will not have automated
systems for doing that.


12
0:0:41,49 --> 0:0:46,3
They can invite a doctor
from any area of the globe


13
0:0:46,3 --> 0:0:49,88
on board that boat.
They can invite him


14
0:0:49,88 --> 0:0:53,93
as a virtual image or
as a symbol manipulator


15
0:0:53,93 --> 0:0:58,65
and that doctor can study the
condition without being there.


16
0:0:58,65 --> 0:1:3,17
You have a totally different system.
That's why I use the term


17
0:1:3,17 --> 0:1:6,5
'total enclosure systems'.


18
0:1:6,5 --> 0:1:9,6
Each building generates
its own electricity.


19
0:1:9,6 --> 0:1:11,49
It provides for all human needs


20
0:1:11,49 --> 0:1:16,3
and even grows or prepares
food in the building.


21
0:1:16,3 --> 0:1:19,43
Today you have places
where you have fast food.


22
0:1:19,43 --> 0:1:23,54
You have 15 cooks and
waitresses and all that.


23
0:1:23,54 --> 0:1:27,4
In the future, you'll be
able to extrude the food


24
0:1:27,4 --> 0:1:31,2
very rapidly with no people at all.
You don't need people.


25
0:1:31,2 --> 0:1:33,66
You don't need waitresses,
cooks, and all.


26
0:1:33,66 --> 0:1:36,3
What you need is
the food handled


27
0:1:36,3 --> 0:1:40,64
the way the food is handled
by people, only much faster.


28
0:1:40,64 --> 0:1:43,69
Remember, it takes a
doctor time to diagnose.


29
0:1:43,69 --> 0:1:48,69
He's got to study the symbols and
tell what the problem might be.


30
0:1:48,69 --> 0:1:52,54
Scanning by machine
is very fast.


31
0:1:52,54 --> 0:1:57,16
I can't tell you exactly what
hospitals will look like


32
0:1:57,16 --> 0:1:59,59
or what the cities
will look like.


33
0:1:59,59 --> 0:2:3,5
Although we know that beds
would be very similar


34
0:2:3,5 --> 0:2:7,3
only they'd be more flexible.


35
0:2:7,3 --> 0:2:10,55
Not only that, the bed will
have monitors built-in.


36
0:2:10,55 --> 0:2:16,13
If there's any kind of emergency,
the bed can stimulate you


37
0:2:16,13 --> 0:2:21,86
out of that emergency and call for
help without you even knowing it.


38
0:2:21,86 --> 0:2:25,7
If you have palpitations or
unusual physical conditions


39
0:2:25,7 --> 0:2:29,2
while you're asleep, a
staff would arrive.


40
0:2:29,2 --> 0:2:33,34
When I say 'total
enclosure' I mean


41
0:2:33,34 --> 0:2:39,28
methods for dealing with all
problems that humans might have.


42
0:2:39,28 --> 0:2:42,75
Does that mean there won't
be a kitchen in every home?


43
0:2:42,75 --> 0:2:45,51
There will be, during
the transition.


44
0:2:45,51 --> 0:2:49,58
Until we realize, instead
of having 5,000 homes


45
0:2:49,58 --> 0:2:53,61
with 5,000 sinks and 5,000 ovens


46
0:2:53,61 --> 0:2:57,78
and refrigerators, you have
gigantic refrigerators


47
0:2:57,78 --> 0:3:2,2
and a food preparation system.
Do you understand that?


48
0:3:2,2 --> 0:3:4,45
It will not be like it is today.


49
0:3:4,45 --> 0:3:7,92
When people look at these
cities that I drew up here


50
0:3:7,92 --> 0:3:10,87
they picture
conventional approaches:


51
0:3:10,87 --> 0:3:15,32
a bedroom, a kitchen, a
dining room, a dining area


52
0:3:15,32 --> 0:3:18,6
because you have
people over for lunch


53
0:3:18,6 --> 0:3:21,57
the same value systems
we have today.


54
0:3:21,57 --> 0:3:25,99
I would say that this is
where the future is going


55
0:3:25,99 --> 0:3:30,5
and the future design would
depend on how far into the future


56
0:3:30,5 --> 0:3:33,57
and how far technology has gone.


57
0:3:33,57 --> 0:3:36,82
When they can read symbols
and make diagnosis


58
0:3:36,82 --> 0:3:41,48
when a machine can do drafting
instead of thousands of draftsmen...


59
0:3:41,48 --> 0:3:45,29
A machine can do drafting
much faster than man.


60
0:3:45,29 --> 0:3:47,48
It can scan those lines in


61
0:3:47,48 --> 0:3:51,64
if you put in the specifications
of what you want.


62
0:3:51,64 --> 0:3:57,14
If you want a hospital to
house a thousand people


63
0:3:57,14 --> 0:4:0,18
with the most
economical structures


64
0:4:0,18 --> 0:4:5,3
which have built-in heating
and cooling systems


65
0:4:5,3 --> 0:4:9,3
all that can be stored
in information systems.


66
0:4:9,3 --> 0:4:13,67
The building can probably
be forthcoming in minutes


67
0:4:13,67 --> 0:4:17,49
than rather hours that it
takes draftsmen to do it


68
0:4:17,49 --> 0:4:21,79
and the amount of draftsmen and the
amount of space allotted for things


69
0:4:21,79 --> 0:4:26,14
will not be the same.
If you took an industrial area


70
0:4:26,14 --> 0:4:28,76
with movable walls


71
0:4:28,76 --> 0:4:31,79
and if some manufacturing
process needed


72
0:4:31,79 --> 0:4:37,26
the production of
100 aerocars a day


73
0:4:37,26 --> 0:4:39,8
that space could be assembled.


74
0:4:39,8 --> 0:4:43,89
The movable walls could move to
accommodate the production methods.


75
0:4:43,89 --> 0:4:47,25
If the production methods are
faster two years from now


76
0:4:47,25 --> 0:4:50,2
the walls come together,
the factory is smaller


77
0:4:50,2 --> 0:4:52,45
and the production
rate is higher.


78
0:4:52,45 --> 0:4:56,69
Whatever you have today: ovens,
kitchens; all those things


79
0:4:56,69 --> 0:5:0,3
will be smaller in the future,
produce things much faster


80
0:5:0,3 --> 0:5:3,13
and not occupy the same space.


81
0:5:3,13 --> 0:5:7,8
When you say "How much space
do you need for hospitals?"


82
0:5:7,8 --> 0:5:10,49
It depends: If people eat
nutritious food, do exercise


83
0:5:10,49 --> 0:5:12,85
you don't have many hospitals.


84
0:5:12,85 --> 0:5:17,14
I can't tell you exactly what
the hospital space will be


85
0:5:17,14 --> 0:5:19,92
or how technical they will be.


86
0:5:19,92 --> 0:5:22,1
I can only say this:


87
0:5:22,1 --> 0:5:27,95
The future will occupy much
less space for the same turnout


88
0:5:27,95 --> 0:5:33,4
and that's the message.
If you try to design a city


89
0:5:33,4 --> 0:5:39,22
with a hundred drafting
tables in it, or 30 machines


90
0:5:39,22 --> 0:5:41,53
that is with today's thinking.


91
0:5:41,53 --> 0:5:45,43
And the building will get...
The zone that creates that


92
0:5:45,43 --> 0:5:48,5
will be smaller and
have less people.


93
0:5:48,5 --> 0:5:50,97
Instead of having generalists


94
0:5:50,97 --> 0:5:53,51
where the doctor is a
generalist and he knows


95
0:5:53,51 --> 0:5:57,22
everything from neurology
to other physical problems


96
0:5:57,22 --> 0:6:0,73
it's much easier to have
computers with that information.


97
0:6:0,73 --> 0:6:5,69
Not only do they scan you and
record it in symbolic logic


98
0:6:5,69 --> 0:6:8,78
what the condition
is, it is then read.


99
0:6:8,78 --> 0:6:13,19
Instead of doctors, it's read
by a machine, very rapidly


100
0:6:13,19 --> 0:6:17,61
and then the appropriate action
can be taken by a machine


101
0:6:17,61 --> 0:6:21,5
if it's surgery or
whatever else is required.


102
0:6:21,5 --> 0:6:24,73
To sit down and design
a surgical system


103
0:6:24,73 --> 0:6:28,76
based on today's values
and today's methodology


104
0:6:28,76 --> 0:6:31,82
would be inappropriate
for the future.


105
0:6:31,82 --> 0:6:35,73
A city of that size will
do ten times the work


106
0:6:35,73 --> 0:6:39,6
that a city today of
the same size does.


107
0:6:39,6 --> 0:6:42,9
That's why I can't give
you an exact description


108
0:6:42,9 --> 0:6:47,96
of what hospitals will be like,
only an overview, in general.


109
0:6:47,96 --> 0:6:51,1
A ship is a total
enclosure system.


110
0:6:51,1 --> 0:6:54,97
A passenger liner that has
a thousand passengers


111
0:6:54,97 --> 0:6:59,4
has hospital equipment, cooking,
dining areas, sleeping areas


112
0:6:59,4 --> 0:7:3,86
air conditioned, children's room,
and nurses take care of children.


113
0:7:3,86 --> 0:7:8,35
It has everything that a
thousand passengers may need.


114
0:7:8,35 --> 0:7:13,68
Do you understand that?
A ship is almost a total enclosure system.


115
0:7:13,68 --> 0:7:16,55
It doesn't generate
its own energy.


116
0:7:16,55 --> 0:7:19,68
It uses machines, diesel engines


117
0:7:19,68 --> 0:7:23,34
to generate electricity to
operate the generators.


118
0:7:23,34 --> 0:7:26,35
In the future, the
surface of the ship


119
0:7:26,35 --> 0:7:30,26
will supply the energy needed.
The wave power


120
0:7:30,26 --> 0:7:33,57
and the surrounding area
will supply that ship


121
0:7:33,57 --> 0:7:38,21
with the energy it needs
rather than require input.


122
0:7:38,21 --> 0:7:41,67
Most of the buildings that
I draw that you see there


123
0:7:41,67 --> 0:7:46,48
can be put in the cities of the
future on the outer perimeter.


124
0:7:46,48 --> 0:7:51,41
You need not... You can use the same
basic drawings that I have today


125
0:7:51,41 --> 0:7:55,17
but trying to fill in the
buildings, as to what's in them


126
0:7:55,17 --> 0:7:59,51
I'd rather not divulge
that specific information.


127
0:7:59,51 --> 0:8:2,59
I can go into specifics


128
0:8:2,59 --> 0:8:6,74
but they would only
serve temporarily.


129
0:8:6,74 --> 0:8:10,4
The method of delivery of
people or moving people


130
0:8:10,4 --> 0:8:12,91
depends on the
technology of the future


131
0:8:12,91 --> 0:8:18,1
and it depends on how easy
it is to move people.


132
0:8:18,1 --> 0:8:22,3
If you have total enclosure
systems, it means each system


133
0:8:22,3 --> 0:8:26,4
is self-operating.
It doesn't depend on central power


134
0:8:26,4 --> 0:8:29,36
but they're all connected
to the central computer


135
0:8:29,36 --> 0:8:33,4
and they're connected to all
events in other cities.


136
0:8:33,4 --> 0:8:36,41
If the city system
mechanisms fail


137
0:8:36,41 --> 0:8:38,68
other mechanisms take over


138
0:8:38,68 --> 0:8:41,87
and notify the
appropriate people


139
0:8:41,87 --> 0:8:47,93
or the appropriate machines
to carry out a given task.


140
0:8:47,93 --> 0:8:52,65
They took all kinds of
cardiograms of me today


141
0:8:52,65 --> 0:8:55,6
and then it goes to
the cardiologist.


142
0:8:55,6 --> 0:8:58,46
The blood test is divided
into different systems


143
0:8:58,46 --> 0:9:1,78
where people with microscopes
analyze the blood.


144
0:9:1,78 --> 0:9:6,11
Whatever they see,
they draw conclusions.


145
0:9:6,11 --> 0:9:12,15
If it's symbolic rather than
visual, they draw conclusions.


146
0:9:12,15 --> 0:9:16,24
Machines can draw the same
conclusions and many more.


147
0:9:16,24 --> 0:9:19,34
(Roxanne) They've had experiments
where they've given the same blood


148
0:9:19,34 --> 0:9:22,73
to many different labs and they
drew up different conclusions.


149
0:9:22,73 --> 0:9:28,37
- I know, because their equipment
varies in sensitivity, sometimes


150
0:9:28,37 --> 0:9:32,99
and the time period, the
temperature and other variables


151
0:9:32,99 --> 0:9:37,53
which are not controlled.
Also the profit motive


152
0:9:37,53 --> 0:9:42,25
affects how late their
equipment is, how modern.


153
0:9:42,25 --> 0:9:45,66
People are more concerned
with how many customers


154
0:9:45,66 --> 0:9:48,61
or how many clients they've had.


155
0:9:48,61 --> 0:9:54,19
The future concern is:
optimizing human performance


156
0:9:54,19 --> 0:9:58,39
which is very different,
or equipment performance


157
0:9:58,39 --> 0:10:1,45
making it date optimal


158
0:10:1,45 --> 0:10:4,78
and all information's
available and no patents


159
0:10:4,78 --> 0:10:9,12
so you can use the latest information
in designing your machinery.


160
0:10:9,12 --> 0:10:13,29
You can correspond with people that
know more about it than you do


161
0:10:13,29 --> 0:10:18,4
or you can correspond with machines
that know more about it than you do.


162
0:10:18,4 --> 0:10:22,64
I can't say.
It depends on when it's built.
