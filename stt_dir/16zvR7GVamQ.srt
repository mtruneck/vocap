1
0:0:24,627 --> 0:0:28,987
Plus it was so cold and wet and boring
in the outfield.


2
0:0:28,987 --> 0:0:32,467
I don't think I've ever seen
a ball that slippery.


3
0:0:32,467 --> 0:0:37,27
It was a difficult catch, Mark.
I wouldn't worry. And it's just softball.


4
0:0:37,27 --> 0:0:39,747
'This is it. All systems are go.


5
0:0:39,747 --> 0:0:43,787
'The apple is ripe,
the cross hairs are centralised. '


6
0:0:43,787 --> 0:0:46,547
Soph, I was... wondering.


7
0:0:46,547 --> 0:0:49,107
Do you... like Indonesian food?


8
0:0:49,107 --> 0:0:51,27
Erm, Thai, I quite like...


9
0:0:51,27 --> 0:0:55,107
'I can't do it. It's too much.
I'm not American. I can't... date.


10
0:0:55,107 --> 0:0:58,547
'Restaurant on a barge?
I might as well propose.


11
0:0:58,547 --> 0:1:1,307
'The pub. That's the English way. '


12
0:1:1,307 --> 0:1:2,947
Why?


13
0:1:2,947 --> 0:1:4,827
Oh, just... Nothing.


14
0:1:4,827 --> 0:1:7,827
Everyone's going to the pub.
You want to...?


15
0:1:7,827 --> 0:1:11,387
The work gang? I don't think so.
Mind if I get changed?


16
0:1:11,387 --> 0:1:14,67
Oh, no, no. Not at all.


17
0:1:14,67 --> 0:1:16,587
'Oh, my God. She's taking off her top.


18
0:1:16,587 --> 0:1:19,147
'This is very promising. Or is it...?


19
0:1:19,147 --> 0:1:21,627
'Would she do this if she fancied me?


20
0:1:21,627 --> 0:1:24,427
'Maybe we're... Oh, God, no, no.


21
0:1:24,427 --> 0:1:28,947
'We're only bloody friends! '


22
0:1:28,947 --> 0:1:32,187
And she gave me
a peck on the cheek. It's a nightmare!


23
0:1:32,187 --> 0:1:35,27
- Mm-hm.
- I've got to close the deal,


24
0:1:35,27 --> 0:1:37,827
ask her out without asking her out.


25
0:1:37,827 --> 0:1:40,867
One step forward, two steps back -
that's the key.


26
0:1:40,867 --> 0:1:45,67
- Mm. Yeah.
- So how was your day?


27
0:1:45,67 --> 0:1:47,107
Oh, fine. Kind of weird.


28
0:1:47,107 --> 0:1:50,187
Mum rang to say
that my Uncle Ray is a bit ill.


29
0:1:50,187 --> 0:1:52,747
- Yeah? Is it serious?
- Dunno.


30
0:1:52,747 --> 0:1:56,347
He's in the hospice
so I guess he's being looked after.


31
0:1:56,347 --> 0:2:1,27
Hospice? You... Jez, you know
what a hospice is, don't you?


32
0:2:1,27 --> 0:2:3,267
Like a hospital but nicer.


33
0:2:3,267 --> 0:2:7,667
A hospice is where people go to...
Who... are terminally ill.


34
0:2:7,667 --> 0:2:9,507
Oh. Right.


35
0:2:9,507 --> 0:2:13,307
Yeah, Mum said he was... what you said.


36
0:2:13,307 --> 0:2:16,227
I'm sure he'll be fine. He's not a quitter.


37
0:2:16,227 --> 0:2:19,347
Well, I have to say, probably not, mate.


38
0:2:19,347 --> 0:2:20,787
Probably not.


39
0:2:20,787 --> 0:2:25,987
No, he won't quit. Do you know
what I fancy now? Some Good Life.


40
0:2:25,987 --> 0:2:27,747
Where's more Good Life?


41
0:2:27,747 --> 0:2:32,27
- '? Sail away, sail away...? '
- Are you going to give him a call?


42
0:2:32,27 --> 0:2:34,307
Ray? No. No.


43
0:2:34,307 --> 0:2:38,227
He'll have people calling him
night and day, probably sick of it.


44
0:2:38,227 --> 0:2:42,627
I thought probably best
to give him some peace and quiet.


45
0:2:42,627 --> 0:2:46,467
- '... inside... '
- You should call him.


46
0:2:46,467 --> 0:2:49,907
'My stomach's in my mouth
and I think, "This isn't good. "'


47
0:2:49,907 --> 0:2:53,627
Good to see you, Uncle Ray.
What you been up to?


48
0:2:53,627 --> 0:2:57,307
Mostly I've been lying in bed
taking painkillers.


49
0:2:57,307 --> 0:2:59,627
Right. Cool.


50
0:2:59,627 --> 0:3:3,307
'Jesus, that wasn't very friendly.
At least I came. '


51
0:3:3,307 --> 0:3:5,667
So, Ray,


52
0:3:5,667 --> 0:3:8,107
Jez tells me you worked on the force.


53
0:3:8,107 --> 0:3:10,267
That's right, Mark. 30 years.


54
0:3:10,267 --> 0:3:12,27
Blimey.


55
0:3:12,27 --> 0:3:16,587
So must be nice getting a bit of support
from your police mates.


56
0:3:16,587 --> 0:3:19,667
The force. You can trust the force,
can't you?


57
0:3:19,667 --> 0:3:21,707
- Yeah.
- 'What's this?


58
0:3:21,707 --> 0:3:25,307
'This is meant to be my visit.
He's hijacking my visit. '


59
0:3:25,307 --> 0:3:27,747
Mostly they just eat me wine gums...


60
0:3:27,747 --> 0:3:32,387
'Come on, say something. Something
not about dying. Something inspiring. '


61
0:3:32,387 --> 0:3:36,67
Yeah.


62
0:3:36,67 --> 0:3:39,707
People can be so funny
when it comes to illness, can't they?


63
0:3:39,707 --> 0:3:42,827
I mean, it's good that you, you know...


64
0:3:42,827 --> 0:3:46,267
Yeah, that's the one upside
of this whole thing.


65
0:3:46,267 --> 0:3:50,667
Rediscovered that little guy with the
crown of thorns and the big old heart.


66
0:3:50,667 --> 0:3:53,147
Yeah, that's really...


67
0:3:53,147 --> 0:3:55,387
a great thing to have, a faith.


68
0:3:55,387 --> 0:3:57,27
Yeah.


69
0:3:57,27 --> 0:3:58,667
Oh, yeah.


70
0:3:58,667 --> 0:4:0,187
Yeah.


71
0:4:0,187 --> 0:4:3,667
'That's nice. Ray's such a nice guy.


72
0:4:3,667 --> 0:4:8,947
'What a shame everything he believes
is total rubbish. '


73
0:4:8,947 --> 0:4:11,307
OK, well, thanks for calling, Mum.


74
0:4:11,307 --> 0:4:15,947
OK, I will. Bye.


75
0:4:15,947 --> 0:4:17,587
Has it...?


76
0:4:17,587 --> 0:4:22,307
- Ray's dead.
- Oh, man, I'm sorry.


77
0:4:22,307 --> 0:4:24,27
Uncle Ray.


78
0:4:24,27 --> 0:4:25,867
Football, ciggies.


79
0:4:25,867 --> 0:4:29,907
He was gonna make me a bow and arrow
that could go through a dustbin.


80
0:4:29,907 --> 0:4:33,67
He never did, of course, but... wow.


81
0:4:33,67 --> 0:4:35,107
Shall I... turn over?


82
0:4:35,107 --> 0:4:38,707
Yeah. Maybe some Newsnight
or something.


83
0:4:38,707 --> 0:4:43,107
I mean, I wish... maybe
the family could come together.


84
0:4:43,107 --> 0:4:46,667
We could campaign against...


85
0:4:46,667 --> 0:4:48,507
or for something.


86
0:4:48,507 --> 0:4:51,507
Maybe a foundation.
The Ray Foundation,


87
0:4:51,507 --> 0:4:55,387
- for Christians and coppers.
- That's a nice idea.


88
0:4:55,387 --> 0:4:58,827
Something positive's
got to come out of all this.


89
0:4:58,827 --> 0:5:4,547
Something.


90
0:5:4,547 --> 0:5:8,747
I guess I just need some comfort.


91
0:5:8,747 --> 0:5:10,787
Why does it have to happen?


92
0:5:10,787 --> 0:5:12,667
Why does death happen?


93
0:5:12,667 --> 0:5:15,707
Shit, I don't even know
which day the binmen come.


94
0:5:15,707 --> 0:5:19,147
'This is pretty low.
Milking Uncle Ray to get a...


95
0:5:19,147 --> 0:5:22,467
'Hey, I'm feeling bad.
Why not get some nooky out of it? '


96
0:5:22,467 --> 0:5:24,667
I just feel so alone, you know?


97
0:5:24,667 --> 0:5:29,427
Sure. It's like after Tony left,
I thought, "This is it, everything's over. "


98
0:5:29,427 --> 0:5:32,267
But then I thought, "Hey, no, sort it out. "


99
0:5:32,267 --> 0:5:34,867
- Buy a juicer.
- Right. But Toni...


100
0:5:34,867 --> 0:5:36,907
You'd better go.


101
0:5:36,907 --> 0:5:39,587
Classified dates
can be uptight about times.


102
0:5:39,587 --> 0:5:43,347
Go. But I really feel that tonight,
I need someone to...


103
0:5:43,347 --> 0:5:45,27
Jeremy, this is a hot one.


104
0:5:45,27 --> 0:5:50,107
He's six foot, he loves movies and walks,
and we totally clicked on the phone.


105
0:5:50,107 --> 0:5:54,627
'How can she be this heartless to
someone who's as upset as I say I am?


106
0:5:54,627 --> 0:5:58,547
'Maybe I am as upset as I say I am,
it's just coming out weird. '


107
0:5:58,547 --> 0:6:3,267
Toni, listen, nothing could make me feel
better about Ray's death.


108
0:6:3,267 --> 0:6:6,507
Except maybe one thing could.


109
0:6:6,507 --> 0:6:10,27
Look, Jeremy, death happens,
people die. Move on.


110
0:6:10,27 --> 0:6:13,187
My dad died when I was three
but it didn't screw me up.


111
0:6:13,187 --> 0:6:15,387
'Right. '


112
0:6:15,387 --> 0:6:22,427
I don't waste my life looking for a man
to fill a dad-shaped hole.


113
0:6:22,427 --> 0:6:26,467
'It's perfect.
Big social occasion but no invites.


114
0:6:26,467 --> 0:6:28,747
'It's not a date but it is.


115
0:6:28,747 --> 0:6:31,107
'What if it all goes right, though?


116
0:6:31,107 --> 0:6:35,467
'What about my massive, freakish balls?
Don't get ahead of yourself. '


117
0:6:35,467 --> 0:6:37,987
- Hey, Soph.
- Hey, Mark, how's it going?


118
0:6:37,987 --> 0:6:41,107
Well, actually,
things have been a bit tough.


119
0:6:41,107 --> 0:6:44,507
- Jeremy's uncle passed away yesterday.
- Oh, no.


120
0:6:44,507 --> 0:6:47,747
- Oh, that is difficult. Is he OK?
- Yeah, bearing up.


121
0:6:47,747 --> 0:6:50,667
But listen, Sophie, I wanted to ask you,


122
0:6:50,667 --> 0:6:53,27
might you be free on Friday?


123
0:6:53,27 --> 0:6:55,747
- For the funeral?
- The funeral?


124
0:6:55,747 --> 0:6:59,427
'Oh, no, shit.
It's not perfect, it's cracked. Piss. '


125
0:6:59,427 --> 0:7:3,67
You don't have to.
I just thought it might be nice if...


126
0:7:3,67 --> 0:7:6,427
No, I'd be honoured.
If you want a friend to go, then...


127
0:7:6,427 --> 0:7:10,907
No, no, not friend. No. As a kind of... date.


128
0:7:10,907 --> 0:7:14,347
I thought afterwards, if you like,
we could go somewhere.


129
0:7:14,347 --> 0:7:17,427
- Won't there be a wake?
- Somewhere like the wake.


130
0:7:17,427 --> 0:7:21,747
Sure. Great.
Erm, er, if that's OK, I'm invited?


131
0:7:21,747 --> 0:7:24,667
That's the beauty. No invites at a funeral.


132
0:7:24,667 --> 0:7:26,947
Right.


133
0:7:26,947 --> 0:7:30,827
"As Jonno let rip
with the stolen Kalashnikov


134
0:7:30,827 --> 0:7:34,427
"and Squarehead fired off
a round of monkey puzzler,


135
0:7:34,427 --> 0:7:37,227
"I looked at the towel-head I'd slotted... "


136
0:7:37,227 --> 0:7:41,347
'Where did they get this guy?
This is a freak show.


137
0:7:41,347 --> 0:7:44,747
'Why am I even here? Why is she here? '


138
0:7:44,747 --> 0:7:52,707
"I didn't stop to think about it long.
We all get slotted sometime. "


139
0:7:52,707 --> 0:7:54,907
Thanks, Keith.


140
0:7:54,907 --> 0:7:58,387
Scorpio Patrol,
Real Life Behind Enemy Lines.


141
0:7:58,387 --> 0:8:0,667
One of my brother's favourites.


142
0:8:0,667 --> 0:8:4,867
Now, whilst no one would suggest
that the faith Ray claimed to find


143
0:8:4,867 --> 0:8:7,147
in those last weeks was only a product...


144
0:8:7,147 --> 0:8:10,747
'I'm glad we stopped going
to Liz's for Christmas.


145
0:8:10,747 --> 0:8:13,387
"'Thanks for the Fairtrade nuts, Auntie. "


146
0:8:13,387 --> 0:8:16,67
'She's loving this. What a stitch-up. '


147
0:8:16,67 --> 0:8:19,747
Now, in the humanist ceremony
at this point,


148
0:8:19,747 --> 0:8:24,227
we like to encourage anyone
who wants to share a thought or memory


149
0:8:24,227 --> 0:8:30,147
or reflection about my brother,
to speak up.


150
0:8:30,147 --> 0:8:33,987
'Words... coming. '


151
0:8:33,987 --> 0:8:37,67
'Hey, yeah. OK.
The sympathy vote. '


152
0:8:37,67 --> 0:8:40,387
'I'm gonna blow this gaff
wide open. '


153
0:8:40,387 --> 0:8:42,347
Er, yeah.


154
0:8:42,347 --> 0:8:47,107
I spent some time with Ray
before he... went.


155
0:8:47,107 --> 0:8:51,627
And I just wanted to say
that I think we should all remember


156
0:8:51,627 --> 0:8:56,587
that Ray, by the end, he loved Jesus.


157
0:8:56,587 --> 0:9:0,947
Now, I know, Liz,
there's no proof for Jesus,


158
0:9:0,947 --> 0:9:4,267
but then there's no proof
for lots of things


159
0:9:4,267 --> 0:9:8,467
like... science or... the stock market.


160
0:9:8,467 --> 0:9:10,587
And we believe in them.


161
0:9:10,587 --> 0:9:15,507
Look, what I'm trying to say is that,
if I was dying, and I decided that


162
0:9:15,507 --> 0:9:20,547
even though I'd never
particularly been into, say...


163
0:9:20,547 --> 0:9:22,187
Enya before


164
0:9:22,187 --> 0:9:26,107
but that now I really, really was into Enya


165
0:9:26,107 --> 0:9:29,867
and that in fact I thought Enya was great


166
0:9:29,867 --> 0:9:32,467
and that Enya died for our sins


167
0:9:32,467 --> 0:9:34,907
and I wanted an Enya-themed funeral


168
0:9:34,907 --> 0:9:39,947
with pictures of Enya
and lots and lots of mentions of... Enya,


169
0:9:39,947 --> 0:9:44,67
then I think it would be
a bit bloody rich for my sister


170
0:9:44,67 --> 0:9:48,147
to ban all mention of Enya
from my funeral.


171
0:9:48,147 --> 0:9:54,667
Yeah?


172
0:9:54,667 --> 0:9:58,307
'Well done, Jez, old mate.
You did him proud.


173
0:9:58,307 --> 0:10:0,347
' Oh, poor Ray.


174
0:10:0,347 --> 0:10:2,147
'He's in there,


175
0:10:2,147 --> 0:10:4,187
'in that cardboard box.


176
0:10:4,187 --> 0:10:6,27
'I can't believe it.


177
0:10:6,27 --> 0:10:8,867
'Shit! This just gets better and better. '


178
0:10:8,867 --> 0:10:11,907
Yeah, I guess it just came from in here.


179
0:10:11,907 --> 0:10:13,667
Or maybe...


180
0:10:13,667 --> 0:10:15,707
- up there?
- Ah, yes.


181
0:10:15,707 --> 0:10:17,267
Yeah?


182
0:10:17,267 --> 0:10:19,587
- Here's to God!
- To God.


183
0:10:19,587 --> 0:10:22,827
- Can I get you anything?
- No, I'm OK.


184
0:10:22,827 --> 0:10:26,627
I'll be fine.
I've got to be strong for Jeremy.


185
0:10:26,627 --> 0:10:31,627
He was great, wasn't he? Moments like
this make you realise how short life is.


186
0:10:31,627 --> 0:10:36,227
Right. One minute we're alive,
the next we're dead.


187
0:10:36,227 --> 0:10:39,867
Sometimes we're so wrapped up
in the nonsense of life.


188
0:10:39,867 --> 0:10:41,307
Right, yeah.


189
0:10:41,307 --> 0:10:45,707
I mean, if I want an Xbox,
why don't I just get an Xbox?


190
0:10:45,707 --> 0:10:47,747
- Yeah.
- 'You're losing her. '


191
0:10:47,747 --> 0:10:49,747
It's a brief candle.


192
0:10:49,747 --> 0:10:52,787
A bloody brief candle.


193
0:10:52,787 --> 0:10:54,427
Yep.


194
0:10:54,427 --> 0:10:56,347
Sophie...


195
0:10:56,347 --> 0:10:59,67
c- can I say how beautiful you look?


196
0:10:59,67 --> 0:11:1,387
- Thank you, Mark.
- Can...


197
0:11:1,387 --> 0:11:6,547
Can I kiss you, Sophie?


198
0:11:6,547 --> 0:11:8,587
'Oh, my God. Umm...


199
0:11:8,587 --> 0:11:10,947
'What about my abnormal knackers?


200
0:11:10,947 --> 0:11:14,227
'Ooh, this is nice. How weird are they?


201
0:11:14,227 --> 0:11:18,867
'What I really need is a good, long look
at another man's bollocks.


202
0:11:18,867 --> 0:11:23,267
'But that's so fraught
with potential problems. '


203
0:11:23,267 --> 0:11:25,267
Oh. That was nice.


204
0:11:25,267 --> 0:11:31,427
- Yeah, that was nice.
- 'Thank you, Ray! Thank you, Ray! '


205
0:11:31,427 --> 0:11:35,27
? Onward Christian soldiers


206
0:11:35,27 --> 0:11:38,987
? Marching as to war...?


207
0:11:38,987 --> 0:11:41,787
'It must have been taken
shortly before he died. '


208
0:11:41,787 --> 0:11:47,427
'God. You think you're in, then the
smiting, plagues and pestilence starts.


209
0:11:47,427 --> 0:11:49,987
'Shit, I can't believe it. '


210
0:11:49,987 --> 0:11:52,27
Hey, Jez! I've got news!


211
0:11:52,27 --> 0:11:54,947
- So have I.
- Sophie's coming away with me


212
0:11:54,947 --> 0:11:58,27
to a cottage with a bed for the weekend.


213
0:11:58,27 --> 0:11:59,707
Now, listen, mate,


214
0:11:59,707 --> 0:12:4,587
I need to ask you a straight-up,
man-to-man question about bollocks.


215
0:12:4,587 --> 0:12:8,947
The hospital called. What Ray died of,
Boden-Georgeson syndrome,


216
0:12:8,947 --> 0:12:12,147
- it's hereditary.
- What? Y-You're kidding.


217
0:12:12,147 --> 0:12:15,467
I might have it.
They want me to go in for tests.


218
0:12:15,467 --> 0:12:18,987
Tests? Jesus, mate. Fuck.


219
0:12:18,987 --> 0:12:22,627
- No, are you OK?
- Yeah.


220
0:12:22,627 --> 0:12:26,787
No. To be honest, I'm scared.


221
0:12:26,787 --> 0:12:30,707
- Look, don't be scared.
- I am scared.


222
0:12:30,707 --> 0:12:32,747
Don't be scared.


223
0:12:32,747 --> 0:12:35,267
I am scared.


224
0:12:35,267 --> 0:12:37,307
That's fine, that's fine.


225
0:12:37,307 --> 0:12:41,27
It's perfectly natural to be scared.


226
0:12:41,27 --> 0:12:44,507
'Doctor Runciman has seen this
a thousand times.


227
0:12:44,507 --> 0:12:49,387
'It's just two guys, one with his hand
on the other guy's balls. '


228
0:12:49,387 --> 0:12:52,707
Mark Corrigan?


229
0:12:52,707 --> 0:12:55,907
Dr Runciman's on call.
I'm the practice nurse.


230
0:12:55,907 --> 0:12:58,347
Oh. Pleased to meet you.


231
0:12:58,347 --> 0:13:0,67
'No. No, no, no, no, no. '


232
0:13:0,67 --> 0:13:3,467
- So how can I help?
- Oh, it was just...


233
0:13:3,467 --> 0:13:5,587
I think I should see the doctor.


234
0:13:5,587 --> 0:13:8,907
Not that I've got anything
against your... kind.


235
0:13:8,907 --> 0:13:12,307
If you tell me the problem,
maybe I can deal with it.


236
0:13:12,307 --> 0:13:16,547
Basically, it's -
not wishing to beat about the bush -


237
0:13:16,547 --> 0:13:18,947
it's a problem with...


238
0:13:18,947 --> 0:13:20,587
with my...


239
0:13:20,587 --> 0:13:22,747
Penis?


240
0:13:22,747 --> 0:13:24,587
Testisticles.


241
0:13:24,587 --> 0:13:28,947
- So if you'd feel happier, I...
- OK, trousers down, hop on the couch,


242
0:13:28,947 --> 0:13:31,107
let's have a look at the little fellows.


243
0:13:31,107 --> 0:13:35,267
'Oh, I hope I don't... No leaping
to attention, Captain Corrigan.


244
0:13:35,267 --> 0:13:38,227
'Anyone would say
she's an attractive woman.


245
0:13:38,227 --> 0:13:40,347
'She should have to wear a mask.


246
0:13:40,347 --> 0:13:42,467
'Reagan or Batman or...


247
0:13:42,467 --> 0:13:46,507
'Actually, she'd look pretty horny
as Batman. Jesus, no, don't! '


248
0:13:46,507 --> 0:13:50,267
So have you worked here long?


249
0:13:50,267 --> 0:13:53,547
- Blimey.
- Blimey? What's blimey?


250
0:13:53,547 --> 0:13:57,547
- Does that feel painful?
- No, no. That feels great.


251
0:13:57,547 --> 0:13:59,667
I mean, not great, just normal.


252
0:13:59,667 --> 0:14:2,267
'Oh, how much can a man take? '


253
0:14:2,267 --> 0:14:3,907
You've got a large hydrocele.


254
0:14:3,907 --> 0:14:9,67
It's a simple procedure. The scalpel just
slips in at the back of the scrotum.


255
0:14:9,67 --> 0:14:12,747
'That's cooled things off,
a regular bucket of water. '


256
0:14:12,747 --> 0:14:16,467
'Abandon self-cherishing,
love only others.


257
0:14:16,467 --> 0:14:18,347
'Yeah, well, Mr Dalai Lama,


258
0:14:18,347 --> 0:14:21,987
'you've got to be a suck-up
if you haven't got your own country.


259
0:14:21,987 --> 0:14:23,707
'OK, stay focused.


260
0:14:23,707 --> 0:14:28,747
'Don't have to do them all,
just till you find something to hold on to.


261
0:14:28,747 --> 0:14:32,147
'Islam. Not really
such a fashionable religion.


262
0:14:32,147 --> 0:14:34,787
'Hinduism? That's got a nice vibe.


263
0:14:34,787 --> 0:14:37,787
'Find out the Hindus and the Hindon'ts.


264
0:14:37,787 --> 0:14:41,587
'Good old Bible. Bit "dribble not
the ass's milk on Tuesday. "


265
0:14:41,587 --> 0:14:44,27
'And I know most of it from The Omen. '


266
0:14:44,27 --> 0:14:46,827
OK, Jez, mate. I think that's about it.


267
0:14:46,827 --> 0:14:55,107
Uh-huh. Well, have a good time, mate.


268
0:14:55,107 --> 0:14:57,147
- Is he OK?
- I don't know.


269
0:14:57,147 --> 0:14:59,427
He gets the test results on Monday.


270
0:14:59,427 --> 0:15:2,227
- What do you think?
- He seems a bit on edge.


271
0:15:2,227 --> 0:15:4,627
The thing is, he's not definitely dying.


272
0:15:4,627 --> 0:15:7,947
- He's not even definitely ill.
- You're probably right.


273
0:15:7,947 --> 0:15:11,627
- What about the carving on his arm?
- That's just Biro.


274
0:15:11,627 --> 0:15:15,267
Anyway, he seems to be over that now.
And the whinnying.


275
0:15:15,267 --> 0:15:20,227
Things are looking positive. He's
investigating the key to all spiritualities.


276
0:15:20,227 --> 0:15:23,787
'Try and read a poem,
listen to inspiring music,


277
0:15:23,787 --> 0:15:25,827
'look at a wonderful painting... '


278
0:15:25,827 --> 0:15:29,187
'Or I could finish
the last of that skunk,


279
0:15:29,187 --> 0:15:32,627
'sit on Big Suze's dildo
and wank myself dry.


280
0:15:32,627 --> 0:15:36,67
'I could go to that place Super Hans says
is a knocking shop.


281
0:15:36,67 --> 0:15:38,507
'Lf not, bang a tab and get a massage. '


282
0:15:38,507 --> 0:15:40,947
Er, Jez.


283
0:15:40,947 --> 0:15:43,627
Me and Soph,
we were just having a chat,


284
0:15:43,627 --> 0:15:47,987
and, well, what we were saying
is that what we both really want


285
0:15:47,987 --> 0:15:50,827
is for you to come along
on our weekend.


286
0:15:50,827 --> 0:15:54,587
Yeah? Oh, I kind of had plans.


287
0:15:54,587 --> 0:15:57,747
Oh, you can take
your religious texts with you.


288
0:15:57,747 --> 0:16:1,667
- 'Maybe he doesn't want to come. '
- No point, it's all bullshit.


289
0:16:1,667 --> 0:16:4,467
'God, he really wants me to come. '


290
0:16:4,467 --> 0:16:6,187
It'll be such a laugh.


291
0:16:6,187 --> 0:16:8,227
'Please say no, please say no. '


292
0:16:8,227 --> 0:16:12,147
Er, well, all right. I guess.
If you really want me to.


293
0:16:12,147 --> 0:16:16,187
'I didn't realise
he was this terrified of sex. '


294
0:16:16,187 --> 0:16:20,227
'If I can get the first one over
without major embarrassment.


295
0:16:20,227 --> 0:16:22,547
'First fuck is damage limitation.


296
0:16:22,547 --> 0:16:25,627
'In, out, as much pleasure
as I can give her,


297
0:16:25,627 --> 0:16:29,67
'apologise, and then we can move on.


298
0:16:29,67 --> 0:16:32,267
'Jesus, look at him. What a disaster. '


299
0:16:32,267 --> 0:16:34,507
Jeremy, it's your go, isn't it?


300
0:16:34,507 --> 0:16:37,427
Er, whatever.
I just want to rewind this bit.


301
0:16:37,427 --> 0:16:40,307
Do you have to?
We're trying to play a game.


302
0:16:40,307 --> 0:16:43,747
I gave you the choice -
Tom and Barbara being nice


303
0:16:43,747 --> 0:16:45,947
or Gloria and Mitzy being nasty.


304
0:16:45,947 --> 0:16:49,747
If you don't want your go,
I'll attack Irkutsk.


305
0:16:49,747 --> 0:16:55,267
Fine. Can't you get it into your closed-off
little mind that I don't give a flying fuck?


306
0:16:55,267 --> 0:16:57,147
You will when I take Asia.


307
0:16:57,147 --> 0:16:59,467
Bleaurgh, bleaurgh,
bleaurgh, bleaurgh, bleaurgh.


308
0:16:59,467 --> 0:17:3,107
Nothing means anything. It's all just shit!


309
0:17:3,107 --> 0:17:6,587
Games, snacks, fires, man, woman, love.


310
0:17:6,587 --> 0:17:12,987
We're all gonna end up in the cold,
deep ground, and that's all there is. OK?


311
0:17:12,987 --> 0:17:15,827
Well, fine. I'm off for a shower.


312
0:17:15,827 --> 0:17:17,867
Good night, Jeremy.


313
0:17:17,867 --> 0:17:22,227
- See you in the bed... room, Soph.
- Yeah, sure.


314
0:17:22,227 --> 0:17:25,467
'Oh, what I really want's a woman.


315
0:17:25,467 --> 0:17:29,187
'Oh, God, I'm never gonna have
a woman again in my life.


316
0:17:29,187 --> 0:17:33,667
'I never planted my seed.
My loins are like dried buckwheat.


317
0:17:33,667 --> 0:17:35,547
'It's not fair. '


318
0:17:35,547 --> 0:17:37,587
So Jeremy, I'm going to turn in.


319
0:17:37,587 --> 0:17:40,347
Hope you sleep OK.


320
0:17:40,347 --> 0:17:44,27
Er, thanks.


321
0:17:44,27 --> 0:17:47,867
Er, Sophie, could I have a quick word?


322
0:17:47,867 --> 0:17:57,267
- In private.
- Sure, I mean, this is private.


323
0:17:57,267 --> 0:17:59,747
Must be hell trying to cope with all this.


324
0:17:59,747 --> 0:18:2,867
Well, yeah.


325
0:18:2,867 --> 0:18:4,907
Bloody hell, what are you doing?


326
0:18:4,907 --> 0:18:7,827
Oh, go on.
This could be the last time I do it.


327
0:18:7,827 --> 0:18:9,867
Imagine how committed I'd be?


328
0:18:9,867 --> 0:18:12,747
- I'm here with Mark.
- Mark...


329
0:18:12,747 --> 0:18:15,787
doesn't love you.
He doesn't even like you.


330
0:18:15,787 --> 0:18:18,67
- What?
- He...


331
0:18:18,67 --> 0:18:21,307
He said he's only snogging you
for a joke.


332
0:18:21,307 --> 0:18:24,267
And he draws horrible, vicious
cartoons of you


333
0:18:24,267 --> 0:18:28,867
and wraps them up in sausage meat
and calls you a sausage muncher.


334
0:18:28,867 --> 0:18:32,187
You're drunk, Jeremy.
Try and get some sleep.


335
0:18:32,187 --> 0:18:35,307
Go on. I might be dead in a week.


336
0:18:35,307 --> 0:18:38,707
Jeremy, look, I'm flattered
but I'm here with Mark.


337
0:18:38,707 --> 0:18:41,107
- What about a threes-up?
- Jeremy, Mark's...


338
0:18:41,107 --> 0:18:44,907
All right, OK, I get the message.


339
0:18:44,907 --> 0:18:49,387
Sophie?


340
0:18:49,387 --> 0:18:52,227
Jez must've gone for a walk. Thank God.


341
0:18:52,227 --> 0:18:54,427
You think he'd be more grateful.


342
0:18:54,427 --> 0:18:58,227
He'll change his tune
when I'm in charge of the morphine.


343
0:18:58,227 --> 0:19:1,667
It's like that, is it?
That's how it's going to be?


344
0:19:1,667 --> 0:19:7,67
- Well, excuse me!
- Jez, I didn't... I didn't mean.


345
0:19:7,67 --> 0:19:9,467
'Oh, wow. Oh, yeah.


346
0:19:9,467 --> 0:19:12,627
'Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, she is so...


347
0:19:12,627 --> 0:19:15,467
'Where am I?
Put your tongue out and see.


348
0:19:15,467 --> 0:19:18,627
'Neck? Yeah, neck. Oh.


349
0:19:18,627 --> 0:19:22,627
'Whoo-hoo-ho-ho. Ha-ha!
You can do that again. Oh, yeah. '


350
0:19:22,627 --> 0:19:24,787
- Mark?
- Yeah?


351
0:19:24,787 --> 0:19:27,227
Are you going to take your pants off?


352
0:19:27,227 --> 0:19:29,267
Er, yeah.


353
0:19:29,267 --> 0:19:32,387
Yeah, I will. But, Sophie, before I do,


354
0:19:32,387 --> 0:19:34,827
I need to prepare you for something.


355
0:19:34,827 --> 0:19:37,587
I intend to have an operation


356
0:19:37,587 --> 0:19:41,827
but until I do, I don't want you to be
alarmed by the size of my...


357
0:19:41,827 --> 0:19:45,747
Mark, stop boasting
and get some johnnies.


358
0:19:45,747 --> 0:19:48,827
Shit, they're in the bathroom.


359
0:19:48,827 --> 0:19:52,467
- Stay there, don't go away.
- I'm not going anywhere.


360
0:19:52,467 --> 0:19:57,27
'Got to be quick. Don't want to
have to get her all worked up again.


361
0:19:57,27 --> 0:19:59,67
'Did she say johnnies plural?


362
0:19:59,67 --> 0:20:4,147
'Hope she doesn't think
I'm some sort of superman. '


363
0:20:4,147 --> 0:20:7,867
'Couldn't even be bothered to go to bed.
It's pathetic.


364
0:20:7,867 --> 0:20:10,827
'What's...? Oh, my God. He's...


365
0:20:10,827 --> 0:20:12,947
'No. Don't be dead, mate.


366
0:20:12,947 --> 0:20:15,987
'Shit, no. Oh, God, no. In front of...


367
0:20:15,987 --> 0:20:18,827
'Tenko. That was probably the last straw.


368
0:20:18,827 --> 0:20:23,27
'Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Don't be dead, mate!
Please don't be dead!


369
0:20:23,27 --> 0:20:25,947
'My cock's gone right down. Fuck. '


370
0:20:25,947 --> 0:20:34,467
Sophie! Soph!
Something awful has happened.


371
0:20:34,467 --> 0:20:36,667
What?


372
0:20:36,667 --> 0:20:39,827
He's opened his eyes.
Jez, we're right here, Jez.


373
0:20:39,827 --> 0:20:44,387
- What's going on?
- You're in safe hands now, Jez.


374
0:20:44,387 --> 0:20:47,347
Was he behaving strangely
before the overdose?


375
0:20:47,347 --> 0:20:49,787
No. No more than usual.


376
0:20:49,787 --> 0:20:54,107
Well, he did... I didn't tell you this.
He did make a pass at me.


377
0:20:54,107 --> 0:20:57,867
A pass? He... The bloody...!


378
0:20:57,867 --> 0:21:0,627
He's been under a lot of stress recently.


379
0:21:0,627 --> 0:21:2,987
How many pills did you take, Jeremy?


380
0:21:2,987 --> 0:21:6,307
It's important you remember
how many you took.


381
0:21:6,307 --> 0:21:8,467
Pills? Just the one.


382
0:21:8,467 --> 0:21:10,587
He's delirious, the bottle was empty.


383
0:21:10,587 --> 0:21:12,747
Yeah, it was the last one.


384
0:21:12,747 --> 0:21:16,827
I had a headache. Has anyone got
any Coke? My mouth's all...


385
0:21:16,827 --> 0:21:20,867
I invite you here
and you repay me by trying to...


386
0:21:20,867 --> 0:21:23,27
have it away with my girlfriend.


387
0:21:23,27 --> 0:21:27,147
- I don't think girlfriend's quite...
- I've been feeling very low.


388
0:21:27,147 --> 0:21:29,67
Oh, were you? Were you?


389
0:21:29,67 --> 0:21:31,747
Yeah. I was feeling desperate.


390
0:21:31,747 --> 0:21:35,267
I mean, that's why...
that's why I took the overdose.


391
0:21:35,267 --> 0:21:38,107
- What? But you...
- I couldn't admit it.


392
0:21:38,107 --> 0:21:40,467
I was ashamed. But I did it.


393
0:21:40,467 --> 0:21:44,307
The bottle was full,
I... I took the whole lot.


394
0:21:44,307 --> 0:21:48,707
OK, if you two step to one side,
I'm gonna do a stomach pump.


395
0:21:48,707 --> 0:21:51,467
What? Er, no... Actually...


396
0:21:51,467 --> 0:21:55,427
I admit it, I was joking.
I was lying just then, not before.


397
0:21:55,427 --> 0:21:58,547
I didn't take an overdose.
Put away the hardware.


398
0:21:58,547 --> 0:22:7,347
I was lying just then.
Don't pump me! Don't pump me!


399
0:22:7,347 --> 0:22:9,787
- What the fuck?
- Soph, it's only me.


400
0:22:9,787 --> 0:22:12,187
- I've got something for you.
- Don't do that.


401
0:22:12,187 --> 0:22:15,227
- No one was coming.
- That's not the point.


402
0:22:15,227 --> 0:22:19,347
- It's not?
- No. Mark, we need to have a talk.


403
0:22:19,347 --> 0:22:22,787
- A talk? Oh.
- Mark...


404
0:22:22,787 --> 0:22:26,147
a funeral, it's an emotional time,
lots of emotions.


405
0:22:26,147 --> 0:22:30,107
- Are you finishing with me?
- We weren't ever really...


406
0:22:30,107 --> 0:22:31,707
Right.


407
0:22:31,707 --> 0:22:34,627
Not that something might not,
some day...


408
0:22:34,627 --> 0:22:38,947
Everything was a bit "whoosh!" and
I'd rather it was "dum-de-dum-de-dum".


409
0:22:38,947 --> 0:22:42,507
OK, well, that's just... I guess...


410
0:22:42,507 --> 0:22:44,707
you know...


411
0:22:44,707 --> 0:22:46,987
Did you want to give me something?


412
0:22:46,987 --> 0:22:51,507
Er, no, it's...


413
0:22:51,507 --> 0:22:53,707
it's your pants.


414
0:22:53,707 --> 0:22:55,507
Oh.


415
0:22:55,507 --> 0:22:57,667
I found them in my suitcase


416
0:22:57,667 --> 0:23:0,947
and I thought you...


417
0:23:0,947 --> 0:23:2,987
Anyway, er...


418
0:23:2,987 --> 0:23:6,827
here you go.


419
0:23:6,827 --> 0:23:8,907
Er, well, thanks.


420
0:23:8,907 --> 0:23:11,507
Not a problem.


421
0:23:11,507 --> 0:23:13,547
OK, well, I'll see you.


422
0:23:13,547 --> 0:23:16,147
See you... not around but here.


423
0:23:16,147 --> 0:23:37,907
OK, g... great. See you.


424
0:23:37,907 --> 0:23:43,147
So I, er... I got the test results.


425
0:23:43,147 --> 0:23:45,187
It's positive.


426
0:23:45,187 --> 0:23:47,307
Oh dear.


427
0:23:47,307 --> 0:23:51,907
- Oh, Jez.
- Are you OK?


428
0:23:51,907 --> 0:23:55,227
It's all broken. It's knackered.


429
0:23:55,227 --> 0:23:58,707
He dumped me.


430
0:23:58,707 --> 0:24:2,427
Daddy's gone again.


431
0:24:2,427 --> 0:24:5,347
Why does it happen?


432
0:24:5,347 --> 0:24:9,387
There are all these people
singing and dancing but never me.


433
0:24:9,387 --> 0:24:12,427
I'm sorry, I'll shut up.


434
0:24:12,427 --> 0:24:15,107
My problems are nothing compared to...


435
0:24:15,107 --> 0:24:17,347
Three months?


436
0:24:17,347 --> 0:24:19,27
Three to six.


437
0:24:19,27 --> 0:24:22,587
Jesus, Jeremy. Jesus.


438
0:24:22,587 --> 0:24:27,787
'I'll say miracle drug cure. Maybe she'll
give me another one as congratulations.


439
0:24:27,787 --> 0:24:30,907
'God, hope she doesn't
start crying again.


440
0:24:30,907 --> 0:24:32,947
'Got to... before she...


441
0:24:32,947 --> 0:24:34,987
'Come on.


442
0:24:34,987 --> 0:24:37,227
'I am gonna feel so low


443
0:24:37,227 --> 0:24:40,867
'as soon as this is over. '


444
0:24:40,867 --> 0:24:45,67
? Sail away, sail away, sail away


445
0:24:45,67 --> 0:24:49,227
? Sail away, sail away, sail away


446
0:24:49,227 --> 0:24:53,347
? Sail away, sail away, sail away


447
0:24:53,347 --> 0:24:56,67
? Sail away, sail away, sail away


448
0:24:56,67 --> 0:24:59,747
? From the north to the south
Ebudae into Khartoum


449
0:24:59,747 --> 0:26:59,747
? From the deep sea...?
