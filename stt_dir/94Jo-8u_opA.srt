CLEO: The morning after our
U-Center debacle, we went back


3
0:0:21,14 --> 0:0:23,57
to Clichy Sous Bois to meet the
kids, because they wanted


4
0:0:23,57 --> 0:0:25,8
to show us where they hang
out during the day.


5
0:0:25,8 --> 0:0:28,42



6
0:0:28,42 --> 0:0:31,64
The place was in tatters and
didn't smell nice at all.


7
0:0:31,64 --> 0:0:32,89
[SPEAKING FRENCH]


8
0:0:32,89 --> 0:1:21,68



9
0:1:21,68 --> 0:1:23,66
CLEO: They seem like
good kids.


10
0:1:23,66 --> 0:1:26,59
Not at all like the
stereotypical thugs that media


11
0:1:26,59 --> 0:1:28,793
or right-wing grannies
would make of them.


12
0:1:28,793 --> 0:1:31,463
They played us their latest
track called "It's Time for


13
0:1:31,463 --> 0:1:37,78
Action."


14
0:1:37,78 --> 0:1:40,91
While it goes on a bit long for
me, I actually love the


15
0:1:40,91 --> 0:1:42,46
energy of the boys.


16
0:1:42,46 --> 0:1:45,38
And so we decided to make a
music video for the track.


17
0:1:45,38 --> 0:1:47,57
We're in this [INAUDIBLE] little
cave shooting their


18
0:1:47,57 --> 0:1:49,905
video, so they're
here chilling.


19
0:1:49,905 --> 0:1:53,81
Now walking through here, Dev's
filming from backwards.


20
0:1:53,81 --> 0:1:57,32
I'm not keen on this room
for various reasons.


21
0:1:57,32 --> 0:2:0,88
We get to this zone which
has a strong smell.


22
0:2:0,88 --> 0:2:3,63
And in here is our friend,
Mohammed, He's got very


23
0:2:3,63 --> 0:2:4,9
beautiful blue eyes.


24
0:2:4,9 --> 0:2:7,24
We've given him this stick
and he's going


25
0:2:7,24 --> 0:2:9,504
to be here and sing.


26
0:2:9,504 --> 0:2:10,754
[SPEAKING FRENCH]


27
0:2:10,754 --> 0:2:16,37



28
0:2:16,37 --> 0:2:17,55
OK.


29
0:2:17,55 --> 0:2:19,2
So Dev, I'm behind you, right?


30
0:2:19,2 --> 0:2:32,79



31
0:2:32,79 --> 0:2:35,94
CLEO: They're singing
the chorus.


32
0:2:35,94 --> 0:2:37,77
They're getting ready, he's
got his stick, he's


33
0:2:37,77 --> 0:2:41,4
very into his stick.


34
0:2:41,4 --> 0:2:44,61
CLEO: This place smells
not-pleasant.


35
0:2:44,61 --> 0:2:45,86
Can't wait to get out of here.


36
0:2:45,86 --> 0:2:54,15



37
0:2:54,15 --> 0:2:59,8
Oh my God, no way,
no way, no way.


38
0:2:59,8 --> 0:3:1,3
The floor is covered
with pigeon.


39
0:3:1,3 --> 0:3:3,23
Oh my God, I think I've just
walked on a piece.


40
0:3:3,23 --> 0:3:4,72
I don't know if it's
rat or pigeon.


41
0:3:4,72 --> 0:3:5,7
I'm not really sure.


42
0:3:5,7 --> 0:3:8,86
Am I being awk?


43
0:3:8,86 --> 0:3:13,43
I hope we finish soon, my
nose is not enjoying.


44
0:3:13,43 --> 0:3:15,3
The kids were really getting
on my nerve and they were


45
0:3:15,3 --> 0:3:17,61
really being silly
and annoying.


46
0:3:17,61 --> 0:3:20,15
Because they were sitting behind
and kept giving knees


47
0:3:20,15 --> 0:3:21,8
and stuff like that.


48
0:3:21,8 --> 0:3:23,32
And I turned around and
I was really strict.


49
0:3:23,32 --> 0:3:25,34
I told them to call
me Madam again.


50
0:3:25,34 --> 0:3:27,896
Because they were calling me
Cleo and I said that I was too


51
0:3:27,896 --> 0:3:30,24
angry, and--


52
0:3:30,24 --> 0:3:33,49
they think I'm like an
angry schoolteacher.


53
0:3:33,49 --> 0:3:34,7
But I am.


54
0:3:34,7 --> 0:3:37,8
They're too annoying and
they're too noisy, and


55
0:3:37,8 --> 0:3:40,36
agitated, and fed up.


56
0:3:40,36 --> 0:3:42,35
One of them told me
I was pregnant.


57
0:3:42,35 --> 0:3:44,742
I hate them.


58
0:3:44,742 --> 0:3:47,97
After a while we decided to
stop shooting in that


59
0:3:47,97 --> 0:3:51,27
awk-smelling hangout, and drove
them all to central


60
0:3:51,27 --> 0:3:56,56
Paris to shoot them performing
at Parisian hot spot Le Baron.


61
0:3:56,56 --> 0:3:58,73
This venue used to
be a brothel.


62
0:3:58,73 --> 0:4:2,995
It is now the hottest club in
Paris, a.k.a., Le Baron.


63
0:4:2,995 --> 0:4:7,83



64
0:4:7,83 --> 0:4:10,22
This person here,
he's a renowned


65
0:4:10,22 --> 0:4:12,21
French graffiti artist.


66
0:4:12,21 --> 0:4:16,149
This is his trademark, it's a
little man, Smiley, on the


67
0:4:16,149 --> 0:4:17,495
female's bum.


68
0:4:17,495 --> 0:4:20,2
I don't know where the
shoes are from--


69
0:4:20,2 --> 0:4:22,14
maybe Chanel or something.


70
0:4:22,14 --> 0:4:24,13
I don't know whose
bum this is.


71
0:4:24,13 --> 0:4:25,47
Everything's very
disorganized.


72
0:4:25,47 --> 0:4:29,212
No smoke machine,
no fog machine.


73
0:4:29,212 --> 0:4:30,51
A lot of noisy people.


74
0:4:30,51 --> 0:4:32,452
[SPEAKING FRENCH]


75
0:4:32,452 --> 0:4:36,27
CLEO: While the video wasn't a
100% success, I think it was


76
0:4:36,27 --> 0:4:39,13
OK considering we only had
half an hour to finish it


77
0:4:39,13 --> 0:4:40,69
before the club opened
its doors to the


78
0:4:40,69 --> 0:4:42,33
posh Parisian adults.


79
0:4:42,33 --> 0:4:44,92
And of course our budget, which
was about half the price


80
0:4:44,92 --> 0:4:46,772
of a bottle of cheap champagne.


81
0:4:46,772 --> 0:6:46,772
