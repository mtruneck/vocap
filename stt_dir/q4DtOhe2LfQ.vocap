###22 Yeah, that's it.
###24 Minu, can you duck a little bit?
###27 I want to get his face in the window.
###30 There we go.

###53 DAVID FEINBERG: I'm David Feinberg, and VBS sent me to
###55 China with the camera to film the dirtiest
###58 place on the planet.
###60 It is the city of Linfen, and spending about a day here
###64 breathing in the air is about the same as smoking three
###68 packs of cigarettes.
###69 The scary part is that there's a lot of cities
###72 in China like this.
###74 16 of the world's 20 most polluted cities are in China.
###78 And my bosses convinced me to come here and spend a week
###81 filming and breathing in all this crap so
###84 they don't have to.

###126 Linfen produces what any nation of over a billion
###129 people need-- a ton of energy.
###131 It's an endless landscape of factories all spewing a bunch
###135 of toxic chemicals into the air and poisoning the
###137 land and the water.
###139 There's no clouds, just a permanent toxic smog hovering
###143 over the city.
###146 Linfen is located in the heart of Shanxi Province.
###149 Every day, thousands of coal trucks go between Linfen and
###152 the rest of China's to cities.
###154 Then they come back empty for more.

###218 AILUN YANG: China suffers from both local problems and global
###222 environmental challenges.
###224 So the combined impacts of climate change and local
###229 pollutions are causing enormous consequences.
###233 A lot of the environmental problems in China are very
###236 closely linked to our energy consumption because there's
###240 something fundamentally wrong with the economic model.
###244 That's why the more the economy grows, the more the
###248 environment starts to get worse.
###250 Linfen really shows the other side of Chinese economic
###255 development, which is actually the ugly side of it.
###258 And this is about how unbalanced the Chinese
###261 development has been.
###263 DAVID FEINBERG: The sky in Linfen was taken from a sci-fi
###266 movie, but life there seems relatively normal.
###271 There's 4 million people and like any other town in China,
###274 its roads are clogged with cars and trucks, and there's a
###277 lot of construction.
###280 Linfen has had a bit of a PR problem ever since the World
###283 Bank called it the most polluted place on Earth.
###285 Even the Chinese media has reported on the disaster,
###288 admitting that people have been moving
###290 away because of pollution.
###292 I didn't see anyone leaving town except
###294 all the coal trucks.
###295 They're actually a big source of pollution themselves, and
###298 are everywhere.
###299 
###306 Linfen has no tourism, and I think we were the only
###309 foreigners in the entire city.
###312 Everywhere we went we really struck out.

###326 When we pulled up to this elementary school, some kids
###329 were leaving for the day, and it looked like there was a
###332 huge fire burning down the neighborhood.
###335 The kids weren't too worried, and I realize that this is
###339 probably what they see every time they leave school, or go
###342 outside to play.
###343 
###350 AILUN YANG: Just take the example of air pollution.
###353 70% of Chinese cities cannot meet
###356 their air quality standards.
###358 The burning of coal is the main cause of air pollution in
###362 China, but of course the increasing transport and also
###367 the constructions going on everywhere in China are also
###371 reasons for air pollution.

###524 DAVID FEINBERG: When I found out I was going to Linfen, I
###526 found some painters masks under the sink in our office.
###530 My mom also told me I should wear a mask at all times and I
###533 saw a lot of photos of people on the streets of Chinese
###536 cities wearing masks.
###539 When we got to Linfen we were surprised to find out that
###541 nobody wore masks.
###543 I didn't want to stick out anymore so we
###545 left the masks behind.
###547 However, I still took a photo wearing a mask just to show my
###550 mom when I got home.
###551 
###559 -Back from the waters of the Yellow Sea, far inland from
###563 the eastern plains, for unnumbered generations,
###567 farmers have plowed the fertile soil.
###570 After the harvest, the plow.
###572 And after the plow, the planting.
###574 This has been the cycle, endlessly repeated.
###578 Through the ages, waters from the mountains have been fed to
###582 the fields of the valley for crops that have never failed.
###587 One day the farmer looked up from his work in age old
###591 fields and saw a strange new carriage.
###596 The engineers of a far off land devised new uses for
###599 flowing streams, producing a strange new power.
###605 To the valley came electricity, that bring the
###608 valley home the signs of a changing world.
###610 
###617 DAVID FEINBERG: It was only 20 years ago that Linfen was
###620 nicknamed the fruit and flower town of Shanxi Province.
###623 
###625 Since then it's basically been turned into China's coal mine.
###631 It's even more remarkable to think that this has all
###633 happened in the span of my lifetime.

###696 AILUN YANG: In China over half of all
###700 the rivers are polluted.
###701 One third of the lakes are polluted, and over 80% or 90%
###707 of the urban groundwater are polluted.
###710 So this is about how serious the water
###712 pollution is in China.
###713 Those pollutions mainly come from industry processes.
###717 It's about factories who do not clean up their pollutants
###721 before they release those things into the river.
###724 And also another main contributor is the pollutants
###729 from the pesticide used in the agriculture process.
###734 Most of those cancer villages are actually
###737 caused by water pollution.
###739 And because the people in those villages depend on this
###743 river for their water sources, that's why you see a higher
###750 percentage of cancer patients in those villages.
###756 DAVID FEINBERG: All of the food I had in Linfen was
###758 actually quite good.
###759 It may have been full of cancerous toxins, but at least
###763 I could tell it was grown in the ground as opposed to in
###765 some laboratory.
###766 I have a feeling a lot of the stuff I eat back home may be
###769 just as bad for me.
