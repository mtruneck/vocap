1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,11



2
0:0:0,11 --> 0:0:3,305
NIMROD: My name is Nimrod, and
I'm a massive fan of "Harry


3
0:0:3,305 --> 0:0:7,6
Potter." I was jumping up and
down excited in the air about


4
0:0:7,6 --> 0:0:9,81
JK Rowling mentioning my
religion in her new frisky


5
0:0:9,81 --> 0:0:11,722
book for adults.


6
0:0:11,722 --> 0:0:22,41



7
0:0:22,41 --> 0:0:24,63
NIMROD: She had made Sikh
people so proud.


8
0:0:24,63 --> 0:0:27,24
I'm from the Sikh community,
which is represented in the


9
0:0:27,24 --> 0:0:28,76
book, page 120.


10
0:0:28,76 --> 0:0:31,92
She empowered us to
be who we are.


11
0:0:31,92 --> 0:0:34,895
Yeah, because I'm, like, the
voice of my generation or at


12
0:0:34,895 --> 0:0:37,29
least a voice of a generation.


13
0:0:37,29 --> 0:0:38,22
I not like pushing.


14
0:0:38,22 --> 0:0:39,86
I was honestly here
for a long time.


15
0:0:39,86 --> 0:0:40,1
-No you haven't.


16
0:0:40,1 --> 0:0:41,153
NIMROD: I'm not saying
you're before me.


17
0:0:41,153 --> 0:0:41,536
-No you haven't.


18
0:0:41,536 --> 0:0:43,746
No you haven't If you don't go
to the back of the queue, then


19
0:0:43,746 --> 0:0:44,52
I'll just have to ask
you to leave.


20
0:0:44,52 --> 0:0:44,75
NIMROD: That's fine.


21
0:0:44,75 --> 0:0:45,9
I'm going, I'm going.


22
0:0:45,9 --> 0:0:47,454
The thing is, I'm from the
Sikh community, which is


23
0:0:47,454 --> 0:0:50,0
represented in the book and
just because I grab


24
0:0:50,0 --> 0:0:50,295
attention--


25
0:0:50,295 --> 0:0:51,558
-Wait the queue.


26
0:0:51,558 --> 0:0:53,98
NIMROD: Yeah, definitely.


27
0:0:53,98 --> 0:0:57,102
And I'm not saying I need to get
to her because I'm Sikh.


28
0:0:57,102 --> 0:0:58,518
I'm just actually the only


29
0:0:58,518 --> 0:1:0,406
representative of this community.


30
0:1:0,406 --> 0:1:1,67
And she's done amazing things.


31
0:1:1,67 --> 0:1:2,605
-I know what she's done,
whether you're--


32
0:1:2,605 --> 0:1:4,319
NIMROD: Like, we're not allowed
to shave and she's


33
0:1:4,319 --> 0:1:7,412
done the whole thing with
the mustachioed girl.


34
0:1:7,412 --> 0:1:14,2



35
0:1:14,2 --> 0:1:16,255
NIMROD: Sikh girls from my
community are proud again to


36
0:1:16,255 --> 0:1:16,95
have mustaches.


37
0:1:16,95 --> 0:1:17,25
-You're right.


38
0:1:17,25 --> 0:1:18,48
Yeah.


39
0:1:18,48 --> 0:1:19,54
NIMROD: Because they usually
weren't allowed to shave.


40
0:1:19,54 --> 0:1:20,49
But now it's like a bit


41
0:1:20,49 --> 0:1:21,97
modernizing the whole religion.


42
0:1:21,97 --> 0:1:22,5
-That's good.


43
0:1:22,5 --> 0:1:23,6
NIMROD: Yeah.


44
0:1:23,6 --> 0:1:23,19
-Excellent.


45
0:1:23,19 --> 0:1:24,44
NIMROD: Yeah.


46
0:1:24,44 --> 0:1:29,145



47
0:1:29,145 --> 0:1:31,59
NIMROD: Because the book is not
racist at all and, like,


48
0:1:31,59 --> 0:1:33,95
denying racism is kind
of the new racism.


49
0:1:33,95 --> 0:1:34,94
-Right.


50
0:1:34,94 --> 0:1:37,23
NIMROD: And the book is
all for, like, racism.


51
0:1:37,23 --> 0:1:40,7
I actually put the "Harry
Potter" book inside this book


52
0:1:40,7 --> 0:1:42,46
hoping she would sign that
because I don't have any


53
0:1:42,46 --> 0:1:44,35
"Harry Potter" book signed.


54
0:1:44,35 --> 0:1:46,653
And yeah, I'm a Sikh Jew.


55
0:1:46,653 --> 0:1:48,82
-Thank you very much.


56
0:1:48,82 --> 0:1:50,87
NIMROD: Have you ever
dated a Sikh guy?


57
0:1:50,87 --> 0:1:51,41
-No, I haven't.


58
0:1:51,41 --> 0:1:52,516
NIMROD: Sikh girl?


59
0:1:52,516 --> 0:1:53,43
-No.


60
0:1:53,43 --> 0:1:55,154
NIMROD: I'm a Sikh Jew.


61
0:1:55,154 --> 0:1:55,648
-You're Jewish?


62
0:1:55,648 --> 0:1:56,142
-I'm Jewish.


63
0:1:56,142 --> 0:1:56,636
NIMROD: Really?


64
0:1:56,636 --> 0:1:57,13
-Yes.


65
0:1:57,13 --> 0:1:59,89
NIMROD: I'm a Jewish part
of the Sikh community.


66
0:1:59,89 --> 0:2:0,36
-All right.


67
0:2:0,36 --> 0:2:2,24
NIMROD: Yeah.


68
0:2:2,24 --> 0:2:4,45
-[INAUDIBLE]


69
0:2:4,45 --> 0:2:4,77
NIMROD: No, no.


70
0:2:4,77 --> 0:2:5,35
That's the actual book.


71
0:2:5,35 --> 0:2:8,57
I just removed the thing.


72
0:2:8,57 --> 0:2:10,449
-Is your book ready?


73
0:2:10,449 --> 0:2:11,699
Oh, that's the wrong page.


74
0:2:11,699 --> 0:2:14,388



75
0:2:14,388 --> 0:2:16,76
-OK, thanks.


76
0:2:16,76 --> 0:2:17,71
NIMROD: Thanks.


77
0:2:17,71 --> 0:2:20,39
I love what you did for the
Sikh community, actually.


78
0:2:20,39 --> 0:2:21,398
JK ROWLING: I kept
looking at you--


79
0:2:21,398 --> 0:2:21,851
NIMROD: I wanted to ask, yeah.


80
0:2:21,851 --> 0:2:23,21
JK ROWLING: --waiting for
someone to call on you.


81
0:2:23,21 --> 0:2:25,14
NIMROD: It's OK for us to
shave the mustaches now.


82
0:2:25,14 --> 0:2:26,39
JK ROWLING: Yes, I know.


83
0:2:26,39 --> 0:2:28,81



84
0:2:28,81 --> 0:2:29,29
NIMROD: It's perfectly
fine, yeah.


85
0:2:29,29 --> 0:2:31,21
The Sikh bump--


86
0:2:31,21 --> 0:2:32,17
thanks.


87
0:2:32,17 --> 0:2:34,3
And by the way, I just want
to leave you the gift.


88
0:2:34,3 --> 0:2:35,942
It's the Sikh god.


89
0:2:35,942 --> 0:2:37,33
NIMROD: You just paint it
dot by dot, then you--


90
0:2:37,33 --> 0:2:38,29
NIMROD: --go ahead
and paint it.


91
0:2:38,29 --> 0:2:38,39
-Thank you.


92
0:2:38,39 --> 0:2:39,417
Bye bye.


93
0:2:39,417 --> 0:2:41,902
JK ROWLING: Thank you.


94
0:2:41,902 --> 0:2:44,11
NIMROD: Finally, I can shave
because in the book, she


95
0:2:44,11 --> 0:2:47,22
empowers Sikh women
to shave again.


96
0:2:47,22 --> 0:2:48,71
It's a big development for us.


97
0:2:48,71 --> 0:2:49,67
-No, she doesn't.


98
0:2:49,67 --> 0:2:49,76
NIMROD: Yes, she does.


99
0:2:49,76 --> 0:2:50,82
Page 120.


100
0:2:50,82 --> 0:2:52,5
-No, no she doesn't.


101
0:2:52,5 --> 0:2:52,46
-No, she doesn't.


102
0:2:52,46 --> 0:2:53,326
-Don't get me started.


103
0:2:53,326 --> 0:2:53,782
NIMROD: Start.


104
0:2:53,782 --> 0:2:55,64
-No.


105
0:2:55,64 --> 0:2:57,9
NIMROD: She did a big service
for the Sikh.


106
0:2:57,9 --> 0:2:58,428
-She did a big service.


107
0:2:58,428 --> 0:2:59,895
It's nothing to do
with shaving.


108
0:2:59,895 --> 0:3:2,217
If that's your interpretation,
you need to go back to the


109
0:3:2,217 --> 0:3:2,34
beginning.


110
0:3:2,34 --> 0:3:2,584
-It's OK.


111
0:3:2,584 --> 0:3:2,829
Leave it.


112
0:3:2,829 --> 0:3:3,32
It's OK.


113
0:3:3,32 --> 0:3:4,14
NIMROD: I think she--


114
0:3:4,14 --> 0:3:4,7
I love her.


115
0:3:4,7 --> 0:3:7,65
I am a big fan.


116
0:3:7,65 --> 0:3:9,396
It's an amazing signature.


117
0:3:9,396 --> 0:3:9,81
-Yeah.


118
0:3:9,81 --> 0:3:12,234
NIMROD: You think I can sell
it to other people?


119
0:3:12,234 --> 0:3:12,716
[INAUDIBLE]


120
0:3:12,716 --> 0:3:14,65
-You can try, yeah, on eBay.


121
0:3:14,65 --> 0:3:15,66
NIMROD: eBay?


122
0:3:15,66 --> 0:3:16,62
-Or something, yeah.


123
0:3:16,62 --> 0:3:17,645
NIMROD: Or Amazon resale?


124
0:3:17,645 --> 0:3:18,36
-Yeah.


125
0:3:18,36 --> 0:3:20,82
NIMROD: Yeah, 120 quid for
[INAUDIBLE], I guess.


126
0:3:20,82 --> 0:3:21,9
-That's OK.


127
0:3:21,9 --> 0:3:22,4
I mean, yeah, anything.


128
0:3:22,4 --> 0:3:23,1
NIMROD: After I read it,
of course, yeah.


129
0:3:23,1 --> 0:3:23,858
-Yeah.


130
0:3:23,858 --> 0:5:23,858
[MUSIC PLAYING]
