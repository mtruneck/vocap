>>Conan O'Brien: Thank you.
Thank you.


3
0:0:55,91 --> 0:0:57,989
And, please, stop doing that.
[ Laughter ]


4
0:0:57,989 --> 0:1:1,52
>>Conan O'Brien: What is your name, sir?
>>> Stephen.


5
0:1:1,52 --> 0:1:4,949
>>Conan O'Brien: Stephen, thank you for playing
music usually reserved for a fireman's funeral.


6
0:1:4,949 --> 0:1:9,42
That's creating a really nice atmosphere for
me right now.


7
0:1:9,42 --> 0:1:19,82
How are you all doing, everybody?
How are you, Google?


8
0:1:19,82 --> 0:1:21,77
[ Cheers and applause ]
>>Conan O'Brien: Who the hell are you?


9
0:1:21,77 --> 0:1:23,9
Welcome to Google.
>>Vic Gundotra: Welcome to Google.


10
0:1:23,9 --> 0:1:25,7
It's very nice that you could be here.
It's exciting.


11
0:1:25,7 --> 0:1:28,56
>>Conan O'Brien: Thank you, thank you.
People are so thrilled to see you.


12
0:1:28,56 --> 0:1:31,66
>>Vic Gundotra: I noticed that.
>>Conan O'Brien: What a rare honor for them


13
0:1:31,66 --> 0:1:35,95
to see you in the flesh.
>>Vic Gundotra: Yes, on behalf of all the


14
0:1:35,95 --> 0:1:39,74
Googlers, let me --
>>Conan O'Brien: You call yourselves Googlers.


15
0:1:39,74 --> 0:1:43,27
>>Vic Gundotra: We do.
Aren't we Googlers?


16
0:1:43,27 --> 0:1:44,789
Googlers, yeah.
[ Applause ]


17
0:1:44,789 --> 0:1:48,31
>>Conan O'Brien: Let's start there.
We can do better than "Googler," okay?


18
0:1:48,31 --> 0:1:53,25
Something cooler, especially for the guys
when they're walking into a bar, you hear


19
0:1:53,25 --> 0:1:55,89
what I'm saying.
I'm a Googler.


20
0:1:55,89 --> 0:1:58,75
[ Laughter ]
>>Conan O'Brien: You don't want to -- like,


21
0:1:58,75 --> 0:1:59,959
I'm a "G" man or something.
[ Laughter ]


22
0:1:59,959 --> 0:2:4,239
>>Conan O'Brien: You've got to get something
else going, because "Googler"!


23
0:2:4,239 --> 0:2:9,19
>>Vic Gundotra: Welcome.
>>Conan O'Brien: We're pretty much done here,


24
0:2:9,19 --> 0:2:10,86
aren't we?
>>Vic Gundotra: We are done.


25
0:2:10,86 --> 0:2:13,11
>>Conan O'Brien: You seem stunned.
>>Vic Gundotra: Yes.


26
0:2:13,11 --> 0:2:15,569
So --
>>Conan O'Brien: But you invited me, and that's


27
0:2:15,569 --> 0:2:16,22
your problem.
>>Vic Gundotra: I did.


28
0:2:16,22 --> 0:2:20,4
So you were at Twitter last week.
>>Conan O'Brien: No.


29
0:2:20,4 --> 0:2:24,85
It was a couple of weeks ago.
Look it up online.


30
0:2:24,85 --> 0:2:26,66
Ha-ha.
[ Applause ]


31
0:2:26,66 --> 0:2:30,8
>>Vic Gundotra: This is harder than it looks.

32
0:2:30,8 --> 0:2:33,0
>>Conan O'Brien: Yes.
I love this format.


33
0:2:33,0 --> 0:2:35,58
What is this format we're doing here?
This is nice.


34
0:2:35,58 --> 0:2:36,58
So --
>>Vic Gundotra: It's kind of like a slow dance.


35
0:2:36,58 --> 0:2:37,94
Exactly.
Like a slow dance.


36
0:2:37,94 --> 0:2:40,99
>>Conan O'Brien: Circling me.
[ Laughter ]


37
0:2:40,99 --> 0:2:44,78
>>Vic Gundotra: It's like a waltz.
Let's see --


38
0:2:44,78 --> 0:2:48,58
>>Conan O'Brien: I'm a Googler.
>>Vic Gundotra: "G" man.


39
0:2:48,58 --> 0:2:55,72
>>Conan O'Brien: "G" man, yes.
So what were you asking me?


40
0:2:55,72 --> 0:2:58,34
You asked me about Twitter.
Yes, I went by Twitter.


41
0:2:58,34 --> 0:3:1,93
Does that bother you guys?
Are you guys mad at Twitter or something?


42
0:3:1,93 --> 0:3:4,79
I don't know what the rivalries are here.
You have to explain it to me.


43
0:3:4,79 --> 0:3:7,62
>>Vic Gundotra: It wasn't a rivalry.
A lot of us were wondering the intentions,


44
0:3:7,62 --> 0:3:12,4
Intel, Twitter, Googler.
Coco, level with me, are you looking for a


45
0:3:12,4 --> 0:3:14,33
job in the Silicon Valley.
Is that what you're doing?


46
0:3:14,33 --> 0:3:17,96
>>Conan O'Brien: I'm looking for free stuff.
>>Vic Gundotra: Free stuff.


47
0:3:17,96 --> 0:3:22,319
You've come to the right place.
You've come to the right place.


48
0:3:22,319 --> 0:3:25,1
Why don't you have a seat.
>>Conan O'Brien: Yes, let's sit in this fake


49
0:3:25,1 --> 0:3:28,19
airport lounge that we've created.
>>Vic Gundotra: Yes.


50
0:3:28,19 --> 0:3:31,47
[ Laughter ]
>>Conan O'Brien: My flight was supposed to


51
0:3:31,47 --> 0:3:35,11
board 20 minutes ago.
Is this complimentary?


52
0:3:35,11 --> 0:3:37,63
>>Vic Gundotra: It is.
>>Conan O'Brien: Then this trip was worth


53
0:3:37,63 --> 0:3:38,1
it.
[ Laughter ]


54
0:3:38,1 --> 0:3:41,74
>>Conan O'Brien: So I'm sure you have many
questions for me.


55
0:3:41,74 --> 0:3:43,36
>>Vic Gundotra: I do.
But don't mind me.


56
0:3:43,36 --> 0:3:46,319
If you feel like dancing, go right for it.
>>Conan O'Brien: Whatever you like.


57
0:3:46,319 --> 0:3:49,83
>>Vic Gundotra: So we have a thing inside
Google called a Dory.


58
0:3:49,83 --> 0:3:53,31
It basically allows -- a Dory, an internal
name: You don't need to know what it is.


59
0:3:53,31 --> 0:3:54,48

.


60
0:3:54,48 --> 0:3:57,98
>>Vic Gundotra: It allows --
>>Conan O'Brien: The most condescending man


61
0:3:57,98 --> 0:4:2,349
I've ever met.
Hey, don't you worry about it.


62
0:4:2,349 --> 0:4:3,97
[ Laughter ]
>>Conan O'Brien: You just relax and let the


63
0:4:3,97 --> 0:4:8,4
search engine do the work.
>>Vic Gundotra: We have 45 minutes.


64
0:4:8,4 --> 0:4:12,2
We're just getting started.
>>Conan O'Brien: I've got nowhere else to


65
0:4:12,2 --> 0:4:17,31
go.
This looks like the club in purple rain.


66
0:4:17,31 --> 0:4:18,47
I like everybody --
[ Laughter ]


67
0:4:18,47 --> 0:4:22,99
>>Conan O'Brien: Are you all -- whoo!
-- dancing?


68
0:4:22,99 --> 0:4:26,18
When Morris day and the time come out.
You kids are young.


69
0:4:26,18 --> 0:4:31,25
You'll figure it out soon.
>>Vic Gundotra: So Googlers, or "G" men --


70
0:4:31,25 --> 0:4:33,44
>>Conan O'Brien: And ladies.
>>Vic Gundotra: -- and ladies, submitted a


71
0:4:33,44 --> 0:4:35,84
bunch of questions.
It's a very Democratic process.


72
0:4:35,84 --> 0:4:40,7
We get to vote on the best questions.
And then I cull them and pick the best one,


73
0:4:40,7 --> 0:4:43,81
so it's quasi Democratic, I guess.
>>Conan O'Brien: It's not Democratic at all.


74
0:4:43,81 --> 0:4:48,62
[ Laughter ]
>>Conan O'Brien: That's like Stalin saying,


75
0:4:48,62 --> 0:4:51,19
"You guys decide amongst yourselves and then
I'll kill all of you."


76
0:4:51,19 --> 0:4:56,44
>>Vic Gundotra: Yeah, I guess you're right.
>>Conan O'Brien: How is that Democratic?


77
0:4:56,44 --> 0:4:58,81
>>Vic Gundotra: You have a point.
>>Conan O'Brien: You have the illusion of


78
0:4:58,81 --> 0:5:1,99
democracy here.
Give them some turquoise girl's bicycles.


79
0:5:1,99 --> 0:5:13,31
[ Laughter. ]
>>Conan O'Brien: Give them some free chai


80
0:5:13,31 --> 0:5:17,31
lattes, and then grind them for all they're
worth.


81
0:5:17,31 --> 0:5:21,8
[ Laughter. ]
>>Conan O'Brien: You're getting nervous, aren't


82
0:5:21,8 --> 0:5:23,11
you?
>>Vic Gundotra: No.


83
0:5:23,11 --> 0:5:25,2
[ Laughter. ]
>>Conan O'Brien: You're wishing I hadn't come.


84
0:5:25,2 --> 0:5:28,889
[ Laughter ]
>>Vic Gundotra: Let's start with the questions.


85
0:5:28,889 --> 0:5:32,8
[ Laughter ]
>>Vic Gundotra: The first one is from a Googler


86
0:5:32,8 --> 0:5:34,24
named "Chirp."
>>Conan O'Brien: Named what?


87
0:5:34,24 --> 0:5:37,389
>>Vic Gundotra: It says "chirp."
I'm sorry. It says "Chip."


88
0:5:37,389 --> 0:5:41,1
>>Conan O'Brien: Why are you running this
thing?


89
0:5:41,1 --> 0:5:45,2
"This first question is from Chirp."
[ Laughter ]


90
0:5:45,2 --> 0:5:48,32
>>Conan O'Brien: Lipslav gibble ja- -- Oh,
I'm sorry. It's upside-down.


91
0:5:48,32 --> 0:5:50,62
You're going to be fine.
Breathe deeply.


92
0:5:50,62 --> 0:5:55,34
We'll get through this.
>>Vic Gundotra: Here's the question: What


93
0:5:55,34 --> 0:6:0,54
lessons and wisdom can you offer those seeking
to grow a beard as luxurious as yours?


94
0:6:0,54 --> 0:6:5,86
>>Conan O'Brien: Shots of testosterone helped
me.


95
0:6:5,86 --> 0:6:14,13
I grew this beard pretty much out of -- it
was a -- a feeling of -- for every day for


96
0:6:14,13 --> 0:6:20,3
17 years, I've had to shave.
And I just -- the first day that I didn't


97
0:6:20,3 --> 0:6:23,57
have "The Tonight Show," I woke up and I thought,
at least I don't have to shave.


98
0:6:23,57 --> 0:6:26,0
And then I went with that.
And it's one of those things where you just


99
0:6:26,0 --> 0:6:28,58
go with the opportunity.
I just stopped shaving.


100
0:6:28,58 --> 0:6:32,5
And then, really, very quickly, 'cause I'm
all man, --


101
0:6:32,5 --> 0:6:35,61
[ Laughter ]
>>Conan O'Brien: -- I had this beard, literally,


102
0:6:35,61 --> 0:6:38,49
within a day, I had this beard.
[ Laughter ]


103
0:6:38,49 --> 0:6:44,8
>>Conan O'Brien: I am very -- I am just all
man is what I am.


104
0:6:44,8 --> 0:6:46,74
>>Vic Gundotra: Good answer.
>>Conan O'Brien: I -- so I say -- but, you


105
0:6:46,74 --> 0:6:50,37
know, you hipsters and hep cats, you -- What
generation is this?


106
0:6:50,37 --> 0:6:52,16
You're not "Y" even.
You're past "Y."


107
0:6:52,16 --> 0:6:54,65
How old are you people?
Are you all in your twenties?


108
0:6:54,65 --> 0:6:58,86
[ Cheers and applause ]
>>Conan O'Brien: So you've, like, never even


109
0:6:58,86 --> 0:7:1,71
heard of the television show "chips."
I'm just running a test.


110
0:7:1,71 --> 0:7:6,81
You don't even know what that was.
You were all born, like, after "the Cosby


111
0:7:6,81 --> 0:7:11,31
show" was off the air.
I'm quickly trying to find out who this audience


112
0:7:11,31 --> 0:7:12,84
is.
All in your twenties.


113
0:7:12,84 --> 0:7:15,6
>>Vic Gundotra: They don't even know what
"The Tonight Show" is.


114
0:7:15,6 --> 0:7:18,9
They watch the YouTube channel, though.
>>Conan O'Brien: That's good.


115
0:7:18,9 --> 0:7:21,99
I like that.
Who needs to know what a "tonight show" is


116
0:7:21,99 --> 0:7:25,53
anymore.
[ Applause ]


117
0:7:25,53 --> 0:7:38,91
>>Conan O'Brien: (Sobbing) it hurts so much.
>>Vic Gundotra: Where are we?


118
0:7:38,91 --> 0:7:42,36
It'll get better.
>>Conan O'Brien: Anyway, yes.


119
0:7:42,36 --> 0:7:45,32
>>Vic Gundotra: This one is from Mike in New
York City.


120
0:7:45,32 --> 0:7:47,88
>>Conan O'Brien: Are you sure?
You want to read that carefully?


121
0:7:47,88 --> 0:7:52,389
It's from Mitchell in --
>>Vic Gundotra: I've heard that Mr. Burns


122
0:7:52,389 --> 0:7:54,9
was your favorite "Simpson" character to write
for.


123
0:7:54,9 --> 0:8:1,9
What is your favorite Mr. Burns quote of all
time, either written by you or someone else?


124
0:8:1,9 --> 0:8:7,12
>>Conan O'Brien: Boy, I don't -- I can't 
-- don't -- there's not one that comes to


125
0:8:7,12 --> 0:8:9,509
mind.
>>Vic Gundotra: You want to make one up?


126
0:8:9,509 --> 0:8:13,289
>>Conan O'Brien: Well, I guess one of my favorite
things that was a repeating joke we did all


127
0:8:13,289 --> 0:8:18,27
the time that always made me laugh was that
Mr. Simpson [sic], even though he had had


128
0:8:18,27 --> 0:8:24,52
hundreds and hundreds of death-defying encounters
with Homer Simpson, never remembers who he


129
0:8:24,52 --> 0:8:27,259
is.
I always love every time Homer is brought


130
0:8:27,259 --> 0:8:33,99
into his office, he's like, "Simpson, eh?"
And could never remember who he was.


131
0:8:33,99 --> 0:8:37,269
My other favorite thing is that we made him
impossibly old.


132
0:8:37,269 --> 0:8:43,929
We always -- there's an episode, I think that
John Swartzwelder wrote, where Mr. Burns wants


133
0:8:43,929 --> 0:8:48,74
to play -- assemble his old -- a baseball
team, and he wants to assemble a baseball


134
0:8:48,74 --> 0:8:53,92
team of ringers.
So he's going and saying, "Get Luke Appleby,


135
0:8:53,92 --> 0:8:57,47
Morris Brisby," all these people who died
in 1905.


136
0:8:57,47 --> 0:9:4,429
And he can't believe they're not alive anymore.
He was just the most fun person to write for,


137
0:9:4,429 --> 0:9:10,42
because he's a comedy writer's fantasy.
There's limitless potential for him because


138
0:9:10,42 --> 0:9:16,429
he has unlimited wealth and he's as old as
time, we can do anything we wanted.


139
0:9:16,429 --> 0:9:21,22
He could have chambers deep down underneath
his house where he would -- he could be asleep


140
0:9:21,22 --> 0:9:24,5
in a hyperbaric chamber when Smithers comes
to get him.


141
0:9:24,5 --> 0:9:27,759
Whatever we thought of, we could make happen.
>>Vic Gundotra: I appreciate your explaining


142
0:9:27,759 --> 0:9:33,589
that to me, because if I had to guess what
a comedy writer's fantasy would be, I would


143
0:9:33,589 --> 0:9:35,209
have gone elsewhere.
But thanks.


144
0:9:35,209 --> 0:9:36,839
Now I understand.
Good character.


145
0:9:36,839 --> 0:9:40,529
Let's go else -- let's -- I've apparently
left you stunned now.


146
0:9:40,529 --> 0:9:43,19
>>Conan O'Brien: Do you interact with this
man on a regular basis?


147
0:9:43,19 --> 0:9:47,529
[ Laughter ]
>>Vic Gundotra: Here's -- I won't even tell


148
0:9:47,529 --> 0:9:51,61
who you this is from, except not from me.
This is from the audience.


149
0:9:51,61 --> 0:9:55,92
Are you interested in working at Google?
You can totally have my job exactly five years


150
0:9:55,92 --> 0:9:57,889
from today.
[ Laughter ]


151
0:9:57,889 --> 0:10:2,379
>>Conan O'Brien: I would take that offer at
this point.


152
0:10:2,379 --> 0:10:4,49
The way things are going, I would take that
offer.


153
0:10:4,49 --> 0:10:6,889
>>Vic Gundotra: All right.
>>Conan O'Brien: This seems to be a growth


154
0:10:6,889 --> 0:10:11,19
industry, so, yes, whoever you are, I'm very
interested.


155
0:10:11,19 --> 0:10:13,55
Do I get to choose my -- can I bring my own
bike here?


156
0:10:13,55 --> 0:10:15,1
Is that possible?
>>Vic Gundotra: Yes.


157
0:10:15,1 --> 0:10:17,89
We would do that.
>>Conan O'Brien: Or choose from one of the


158
0:10:17,89 --> 0:10:24,4
Willy Wonka bikes?
Out in the factory.


159
0:10:24,4 --> 0:10:30,489
No, I think you guys are doing something right
here at Google, and I'm all in!


160
0:10:30,489 --> 0:10:32,36
About stock, how does it work?
[ Laughter ]


161
0:10:32,36 --> 0:10:37,449
>>Vic Gundotra: We can work that out for you.
>>Conan O'Brien: I could get something, I


162
0:10:37,449 --> 0:10:40,209
think.
>>Vic Gundotra: Plus a custom bike.


163
0:10:40,209 --> 0:10:42,509
Somebody taking notes?
Okay, good.


164
0:10:42,509 --> 0:10:49,17
Okay, can you please do a dance for us, the
worm, the sprinkle head at the very least.


165
0:10:49,17 --> 0:10:53,149
>>Conan O'Brien: What the hell is this?
What am I, a -- seriously, what is this?


166
0:10:53,149 --> 0:10:58,4
You guys are so power-mad now at Google.
[ Laughter ]


167
0:10:58,4 --> 0:11:5,559

hey, Conan's in the area, make him come by.

0:11:5,559 --> 0:11:10,209
Conan, get over here!
Get over here before your show, get over here!


169
0:11:10,209 --> 0:11:13,759
What do you want, you can have one water.
[ Laughter ]


170
0:11:13,759 --> 0:11:18,309
>>Conan O'Brien: We've got a stool for you.
Hey, do a dance!


171
0:11:18,309 --> 0:11:23,11
Dance around a little bit!
Turn around!


172
0:11:23,11 --> 0:11:25,239
Let's see your ass!
[ Applause ]


173
0:11:25,239 --> 0:11:30,59
>>Conan O'Brien: Yeah, that was pretty good.
All right.


174
0:11:30,59 --> 0:11:34,23
Hey, you want my job in five years?
Maybe I'll give it to you, ha-ha-ha.


175
0:11:34,23 --> 0:11:39,66
Get out of here!
Go do your show!


176
0:11:39,66 --> 0:11:43,119
What's happened you to people?
Okay.


177
0:11:43,119 --> 0:11:45,47
So about this dance, what do you want?
[ Laughter ]


178
0:11:45,47 --> 0:11:51,47
>>Conan O'Brien: What's that, you want some
string dance?


179
0:11:51,47 --> 0:11:53,79
>>Vic Gundotra: String --
[ Applause ]


180
0:11:53,79 --> 0:11:59,779
[ Cheers and applause ]
>>Vic Gundotra: How do I do this?


181
0:11:59,779 --> 0:12:8,589
>>Conan O'Brien: Lick your fingers first.
>>Vic Gundotra: I can do that.


182
0:12:8,589 --> 0:12:11,529
>>Conan O'Brien: Okay.
Okay.


183
0:12:11,529 --> 0:12:13,829
And a little right here.
>>> Whoo!


184
0:12:13,829 --> 0:12:15,689
>>Conan O'Brien: Grab the string, right side
first.


185
0:12:15,689 --> 0:12:18,49
Loosen this up.
Loosen that up and then you go like that.


186
0:12:18,49 --> 0:12:21,559
Then you have to cut the string.
Then if you're feeling really crazy, you can


187
0:12:21,559 --> 0:12:28,869
pull up on this one and cut it, pull that
one and cut it.


188
0:12:28,869 --> 0:12:35,19
And just go to town.
>>Vic Gundotra: I like it.


189
0:12:35,19 --> 0:12:37,269
I like it.
[ Applause ]


190
0:12:37,269 --> 0:12:41,61
>>Conan O'Brien: Come on, speed it up, Conan.
I'm late for my hacky sack in the courtyard.


191
0:12:41,61 --> 0:12:47,47
>>Vic Gundotra: This is from George, also
from New York.


192
0:12:47,47 --> 0:12:51,19
Conan, you have the power to change the game
on YouTube.


193
0:12:51,19 --> 0:12:54,879
What are you waiting for?
>>Conan O'Brien: What does he mean, what am


194
0:12:54,879 --> 0:12:59,98
I waiting for?
Like, clarify, please.


195
0:12:59,98 --> 0:13:2,86
>>Vic Gundotra: Unfortunately, George is in
New York.


196
0:13:2,86 --> 0:13:6,89
>>Conan O'Brien: Oh, okay.
I'm not waiting for anything.


197
0:13:6,89 --> 0:13:7,91
I'm going with the flow.
That's what I'm doing right now.


198
0:13:7,91 --> 0:13:13,549
I've been through a transformative event in
the last three and a half months, just really


199
0:13:13,549 --> 0:13:19,309
nice way of saying I got screwed.
[ Laughter ]


200
0:13:19,309 --> 0:13:25,79
>>Conan O'Brien: You have no natural reflex.
[ Laughter ]


201
0:13:25,79 --> 0:13:32,459
>>Vic Gundotra: Yeah, my wife --
>>Conan O'Brien: They built you here, didn't


202
0:13:32,459 --> 0:13:36,92
they?
There's some nerd way in the back, "The program's


203
0:13:36,92 --> 0:13:40,119
faulty."
>>Vic Gundotra: I have to admit --


204
0:13:40,119 --> 0:13:45,389
>>Conan O'Brien: It's not reading correctly.
>>Vic Gundotra: You're pretty impressive to


205
0:13:45,389 --> 0:13:51,1
pick up on that.
My wife didn't realize that until after we


206
0:13:51,1 --> 0:13:54,97
were married.
Okay.


207
0:13:54,97 --> 0:13:55,429
Let's --
[ Laughter ]


208
0:13:55,429 --> 0:13:57,69
>>Conan O'Brien: We've really got to fix this
thing!


209
0:13:57,69 --> 0:14:3,67
>>Vic Gundotra: So what sketch have you always
wanted to do that wasn't safe for network


210
0:14:3,67 --> 0:14:7,79
television?
And will you bring it to life on cable?


211
0:14:7,79 --> 0:14:11,199
>>Conan O'Brien: I -- wow.
Okay.


212
0:14:11,199 --> 0:14:16,829
Well, we've had many thoughts over the years
about things that we weren't sure we could


213
0:14:16,829 --> 0:14:19,329
do.
But I have to say, for the most part, I got


214
0:14:19,329 --> 0:14:24,699
away with murder.
There's this illusion that, oh, you know,


215
0:14:24,699 --> 0:14:28,549
the -- these men in suits restrained and shackled
Conan.


216
0:14:28,549 --> 0:14:33,739
They never really let him grow a beard or
do comedy that was weird.


217
0:14:33,739 --> 0:14:40,389
And the truth is, because for a long time,
for the majority of my career, I was on at


218
0:14:40,389 --> 0:14:42,999
12:35 at night, nobody that I worked for watched
my show.


219
0:14:42,999 --> 0:14:45,149
[ Laughter ]
>>Conan O'Brien: They didn't see it.


220
0:14:45,149 --> 0:14:49,66
And so we just ran with it.
We just -- I mean, I think about all the things


221
0:14:49,66 --> 0:14:55,759
we did over the years that are just completely
absurd, obscene, weird.


222
0:14:55,759 --> 0:15:0,629
They didn't go through any filter whatsoever.
And often, every now and then, they assign


223
0:15:0,629 --> 0:15:8,369
a lawyer to watch the show and give us notes.
And they were constantly missing the incredibly


224
0:15:8,369 --> 0:15:13,519
obscene thing we were doing and giving us
notes about pronunciation of something completely


225
0:15:13,519 --> 0:15:18,19
unrelated or -- and so there's not a lot that
I couldn't do.


226
0:15:18,19 --> 0:15:22,48
I think it's more about the tone.
I think the tone might change a little bit


227
0:15:22,48 --> 0:15:24,449
now.
Because, like I say, I've been through this


228
0:15:24,449 --> 0:15:27,79
event.
And the last three and a half months has been


229
0:15:27,79 --> 0:15:34,509
all improvisation.
The groundswell of Internet support from a


230
0:15:34,509 --> 0:15:39,249
lot of young people that are in this room
completely took my network by surprise.


231
0:15:39,249 --> 0:15:42,559
They don't know what hit them.
They -- I think there's a lot of people in


232
0:15:42,559 --> 0:15:49,949
broadcast television that are very dismissive
or have been very dismissive about the Internet.


233
0:15:49,949 --> 0:15:55,309
And they're also afraid of it.
And they tend to deride what they don't understand.


234
0:15:55,309 --> 0:16:1,559
So when this explosion happened on the Internet,
when they announced that, well, okay, maybe


235
0:16:1,559 --> 0:16:7,459
we're going to slide Conan over to accommodate
this other gentleman who's having his difficulties


236
0:16:7,459 --> 0:16:10,47
in another time period, and I won't get into
specifics, you'll have to look it up.


237
0:16:10,47 --> 0:16:15,419
[ Laughter ]
>>Conan O'Brien: And I said, you know, what,


238
0:16:15,419 --> 0:16:18,149
that doesn't really work for me, I think,
in a fairly polite way.


239
0:16:18,149 --> 0:16:25,89
They -- there was suddenly a huge reaction
from people -- you know, some of the people


240
0:16:25,89 --> 0:16:29,139
in this room, a lot of people like you across
the country said, "Wait a minute, we like


241
0:16:29,139 --> 0:16:35,72
this person, and this person kind of, you
know, is -- we're with him."


242
0:16:35,72 --> 0:16:41,54
And they started reacting on the Internet.
And the first thing that happened at my employers,


243
0:16:41,54 --> 0:16:44,999
they saw this huge explosion on the Internet
and thought that I was doing it.


244
0:16:44,999 --> 0:16:46,73
[ Laughter ]
>>Conan O'Brien: And they really had this


245
0:16:46,73 --> 0:16:50,459
attitude of, "Make him stop."
"Why is he doing this?"


246
0:16:50,459 --> 0:16:55,439
And they didn't understand what was happening.
I think they still don't understand what's


247
0:16:55,439 --> 0:16:59,47
happening.
And my feeling is, what I've learned is, I


248
0:16:59,47 --> 0:17:5,89
had nowhere else to go, so I started on Twitter
because I literally had no other option.


249
0:17:5,89 --> 0:17:12,49
I was -- I was and am legally prohibited from
appearing on television, radio, and doing


250
0:17:12,49 --> 0:17:16,26
performances on the Internet.
So it was just, literally, like a prisoner


251
0:17:16,26 --> 0:17:21,2
in a 14th-century cell writing little things
on a scrap of paper and throwing them out


252
0:17:21,2 --> 0:17:22,69
the window --
[ Laughter. ]


253
0:17:22,69 --> 0:17:27,8
>>Conan O'Brien: -- and hoping a peasant would
go by and, "Hey, what's this?


254
0:17:27,8 --> 0:17:32,75
He's in the tower!"
So I started to do that and send out these


255
0:17:32,75 --> 0:17:35,35
little things.
And it exploded overnight.


256
0:17:35,35 --> 0:17:40,81
And at first, I started to hear a little bit
of stuff from the other side saying, "We're


257
0:17:40,81 --> 0:17:44,91
not sure you should be able to -- allowed
to -- because of the --" and then they realized


258
0:17:44,91 --> 0:17:49,15
the absurdity of shutting down my Twitter
account.


259
0:17:49,15 --> 0:17:53,64
[ Laughter ]
>>Conan O'Brien: So that started with that.


260
0:17:53,64 --> 0:17:57,5
And then I started to think about the tour,
which I'm allowed to do.


261
0:17:57,5 --> 0:18:2,67
And so we started this idea for a tour.
And then what was fascinating is, by the time


262
0:18:2,67 --> 0:18:7,26
we launched the tour, or announced the tour,
I did not do one -- I didn't spend one penny


263
0:18:7,26 --> 0:18:12,26
often advertising.
I sent out one tweet that directed people


264
0:18:12,26 --> 0:18:17,14
to a Web site where you could buy your ticket.
That was it.


265
0:18:17,14 --> 0:18:20,83
And the show sold out in a couple of hours
across the country.


266
0:18:20,83 --> 0:18:26,6
And that's got everybody, a lot of people,
rethinking how things are marketed.


267
0:18:26,6 --> 0:18:29,51
And I -- there's not one billboard.
There's not -- I didn't have to go to one


268
0:18:29,51 --> 0:18:34,67
radio station and sit with morning deejays,
like, and hawk my show.


269
0:18:34,67 --> 0:18:36,83
I didn't have to do any of that.
It was one tweet.


270
0:18:36,83 --> 0:18:40,85
And I think people are starting to understand
that the world has completely changed.


271
0:18:40,85 --> 0:18:43,65
[ Applause ]
>>Conan O'Brien: And, you know, it has.


272
0:18:43,65 --> 0:18:45,39
And it is changing.
[ Applause ]


273
0:18:45,39 --> 0:18:49,86
>>Conan O'Brien: And I think we can do better!
Sorry.


274
0:18:49,86 --> 0:18:52,31
I --
>>Vic Gundotra: That was great.


275
0:18:52,31 --> 0:18:54,47
>>Conan O'Brien: -- forgot I wasn't running
for something.


276
0:18:54,47 --> 0:19:0,72
But -- but I think that's what's -- what 
-- the biggest lesson that I've learned in


277
0:19:0,72 --> 0:19:3,72
the last three and a half months, is just
a good life lesson.


278
0:19:3,72 --> 0:19:6,99
I'm not trying to sound corny or anything,
but these things happen to you, and you think


279
0:19:6,99 --> 0:19:8,9
you've been dealt a terrible hand or had bad
luck.


280
0:19:8,9 --> 0:19:15,61
And when you go with it and start improvising,
suddenly, you realize that you stumble upon


281
0:19:15,61 --> 0:19:17,91
some of the best things that have ever happened
to you.


282
0:19:17,91 --> 0:19:23,4
And what's interesting about Twitter is that
because you're limited to I think it's 140


283
0:19:23,4 --> 0:19:32,64
characters -- someone is going to correct
me right now -- "Not so!"


284
0:19:32,64 --> 0:19:40,78
[ Laughter ]
>>Conan O'Brien: -- you're all going to rush


285
0:19:40,78 --> 0:19:41,86
the stage.
[ Laughter ]


286
0:19:41,86 --> 0:19:46,92
>>Conan O'Brien: Beats the crap out of me.
But because you're limited, it's a great economy-writing


287
0:19:46,92 --> 0:19:49,54
tool.
There's economy of words.


288
0:19:49,54 --> 0:19:55,73
I'm constantly writing things and then I run
them past Big Bley (phonetic), who is taking


289
0:19:55,73 --> 0:19:59,86
the pictures over there, as if he doesn't
have enough photos of me.


290
0:19:59,86 --> 0:20:5,95
But -- He'll say, "Well, that's actually three
words over."


291
0:20:5,95 --> 0:20:10,74
And it forces you to look back at the sentence,
and it's -- it forces you to crystallize your


292
0:20:10,74 --> 0:20:15,7
comedy idea, which is fascinating.
And the other thing is, I've been -- this


293
0:20:15,7 --> 0:20:17,84
whole tour wouldn't have happened.
This tour is a dream come true for me.


294
0:20:17,84 --> 0:20:26,7
I've always wanted to -- it's half rock show,
half comedy show, and then it's this fantasy


295
0:20:26,7 --> 0:20:29,48
to get to do this.
So the last three and a half months have been


296
0:20:29,48 --> 0:20:33,13
the most interesting time in my entire career,
and I wouldn't have traded this for anything


297
0:20:33,13 --> 0:20:36,65
in the world.
And so three and a half months ago, what looked


298
0:20:36,65 --> 0:20:40,42
to everybody like bad luck has become amazingly
good luck.


299
0:20:40,42 --> 0:20:47,37
And I think that is a lot of what we're --
 what relates to everybody here, a lot of


300
0:20:47,37 --> 0:20:52,47
you are in your twenties, and you take for
granted that this is the way the world is


301
0:20:52,47 --> 0:20:57,2
right now.
But from my perspective, it's changed dramatically


302
0:20:57,2 --> 0:21:0,3
in just seven years.
And I don't even know where we're going to


303
0:21:0,3 --> 0:21:3,3
be five years from now.
So I don't know what television's going to


304
0:21:3,3 --> 0:21:5,39
be five years from now.
There's a lot of people who think you're just


305
0:21:5,39 --> 0:21:10,93
going to experience it all through your server.
And people don't even know how the business


306
0:21:10,93 --> 0:21:13,39
is going to change.
There might not be, really, network television


307
0:21:13,39 --> 0:21:18,159
as we know it.
Wouldn't that be sweet!


308
0:21:18,159 --> 0:21:20,95
[ Laughter ]
>>Conan O'Brien: So you know what I mean?


309
0:21:20,95 --> 0:21:25,68
Who knows?
So, you know -- seize the day, carpe diem.


310
0:21:25,68 --> 0:21:27,72
I hate it when people say that.
I just wanted to work it in.


311
0:21:27,72 --> 0:21:32,87
I'm going to keep talking to you.
Ask another question.


312
0:21:32,87 --> 0:21:38,5
>>Vic Gundotra: I think your point about,
you know, with "The Tonight Show" fiasco,


313
0:21:38,5 --> 0:21:41,65
ended up one of the best things you could
ever imagine happening to you.


314
0:21:41,65 --> 0:21:45,89
Look, you're here, taking questions from me.
>>Conan O'Brien: Again, incredible arrogance


315
0:21:45,89 --> 0:21:53,9
from you people.
Incredible arrogance to say that, yes, you're


316
0:21:53,9 --> 0:21:56,2
right, this is the best thing that ever happened
to you.


317
0:21:56,2 --> 0:21:59,52
>>Vic Gundotra: Yes.
>>Conan O'Brien: 'Cause you made it to Google


318
0:21:59,52 --> 0:22:2,88
with us Googlers.
>>Vic Gundotra: "G" men.


319
0:22:2,88 --> 0:22:8,36
Jay Leno has a big chin, you have a giant
head --

that other guy.

You have --

0:22:40,1 --> 0:22:41,73
Ludicrous.
[ Laughter ]


327
0:22:41,73 --> 0:22:46,26
>>Conan O'Brien: We all on the same page on
this?


328
0:22:46,26 --> 0:22:54,29
That's my ludicrous impression.
Check out my new outfit, May 5th.


329
0:22:54,29 --> 0:22:59,77
Rapper Ludicrous.
Later, in court, "Yes, Your Honor, that is


330
0:22:59,77 --> 0:23:2,24
ludicrous."
You okay?


331
0:23:2,24 --> 0:23:3,9
How are you doing?
I worry about you.


332
0:23:3,9 --> 0:23:6,74
>>Vic Gundotra: I'm doing well.
Any of you want to ask questions, there's


333
0:23:6,74 --> 0:23:7,37
mikes.
So --


334
0:23:7,37 --> 0:23:9,3
>>Conan O'Brien: What's the point of this
then?


335
0:23:9,3 --> 0:23:12,52
>>Vic Gundotra: Well --
>>Conan O'Brien: Once again, I don't understand


336
0:23:12,52 --> 0:23:15,27
what's happening here.
I have some prepared questions from people


337
0:23:15,27 --> 0:23:18,34
who have been preselected.
But if anyone wants to shout something out


338
0:23:18,34 --> 0:23:20,59
at random, go ahead.
>>Vic Gundotra: That's right.


339
0:23:20,59 --> 0:23:23,26
>>Conan O'Brien: You've taken the initiative.
Yes.


340
0:23:23,26 --> 0:23:28,66
>>> Pleased -- whoa, that's loud.
It's been a lifelong dream of mine to touch


341
0:23:28,66 --> 0:23:28,72
your hair.
So --


342
0:23:28,72 --> 0:24:10,89
[ Cheers and applause ]
>>Vic Gundotra: Yeah, about you working here.


343
0:24:10,89 --> 0:24:14,14
>>Conan O'Brien: I solved that problem.
[ Laughter ]


344
0:24:14,14 --> 0:24:18,67
>>Vic Gundotra: Guys, no more touching questions,
please.


345
0:24:18,67 --> 0:24:22,4
>>Conan O'Brien: What are you talking about?
Yes!


346
0:24:22,4 --> 0:24:27,84
Let's touch it up.
You know, I'm sorry, I feel really crass.


347
0:24:27,84 --> 0:24:29,39
I don't even know your name.
[ Laughter ]


348
0:24:29,39 --> 0:24:35,26
Can I just know your name?
Because later on, my wife's going to be, what


349
0:24:35,26 --> 0:24:36,6
happened?
I don't know.


350
0:24:36,6 --> 0:24:39,51
I don't even know her name.
What did you do?


351
0:24:39,51 --> 0:24:43,72
We rubbed our heads together.
What is your name?


352
0:24:43,72 --> 0:24:46,31
>>> My name's Kelly.
>>Conan O'Brien: Hi, Kelly.


353
0:24:46,31 --> 0:24:51,85
We should have done this before we rubbed
up against each other.


354
0:24:51,85 --> 0:24:55,62
[ Laughter ]
>>Vic Gundotra: Yes, there are more.


355
0:24:55,62 --> 0:24:59,99
>>Conan O'Brien: This guy over here.
>>> You chose Reggie Watts for your opener,


356
0:24:59,99 --> 0:25:4,4
who we actually had the pleasure of hosting
about a week ago.


357
0:25:4,4 --> 0:25:6,32
Probably the strangest comedian I've ever
seen.


358
0:25:6,32 --> 0:25:10,33
Can you talk about your choice of him and
why you thought he would be great for your


359
0:25:10,33 --> 0:25:12,62
tour.
>>Conan O'Brien: Someone explained to me 


360
0:25:12,62 --> 0:25:16,7
-- I have never done a tour before.
Someone said, "Well, would you want to have


361
0:25:16,7 --> 0:25:18,77
an opening act?"
And I said, "Yeah, it's probably a good idea


362
0:25:18,77 --> 0:25:22,67
to have someone go out and entertain the crowd."
But this is going to be kind of an unusual


363
0:25:22,67 --> 0:25:28,74
show, and if anyone's seen it or is going
to see it, it's not -- you know, it's not


364
0:25:28,74 --> 0:25:33,71
just a standup show where I come out and hold
a mike and talk for an hour and 40 minutes.


365
0:25:33,71 --> 0:25:37,6
It's also not just a music show.
There's a lot of different things, different


366
0:25:37,6 --> 0:25:43,17
components to the show.
And I've got a sort of a distinctive or weird


367
0:25:43,17 --> 0:25:48,12
brand of comedy.
And so we were talking, and someone at the


368
0:25:48,12 --> 0:25:54,21
company that helped set up the tour said,
"You know, your opening act can really help


369
0:25:54,21 --> 0:25:57,3
kind of brand your tour or help brand your
tour.


370
0:25:57,3 --> 0:26:2,93
So if you want to send a certain message about
your tour, your opening act can help.


371
0:26:2,93 --> 0:26:6,8
And you certainly don't want an opening act
that's completely -- if Wayne Newton, no offense


372
0:26:6,8 --> 0:26:12,72
to Wayne Newton, but if he opened my show
with "Danke Schoen," and that -- it would


373
0:26:12,72 --> 0:26:16,17
be awesome!
But he was unavailable.


374
0:26:16,17 --> 0:26:21,4
[ Laughter ]
>>Conan O'Brien: We were talking, and I have


375
0:26:21,4 --> 0:26:27,13
some really smart, funny writers, and someone
just -- we were chatting about it.


376
0:26:27,13 --> 0:26:29,63
And I said, "If anyone has any ideas."
And someone said, "Reggie Watts."


377
0:26:29,63 --> 0:26:34,51
And then it was like one of those things,
it's like throwing a ping-pong ball into a


378
0:26:34,51 --> 0:26:38,1
room of mouse traps, like people just were
like, "Yes, Reggie Watts," "Reggie Watts,"


379
0:26:38,1 --> 0:26:40,11
"Reggie Watts," "Reggie Watts."
They kept saying it.


380
0:26:40,11 --> 0:26:46,3
And I wasn't familiar with Reggie.
So I went right to the Internet -- you'll


381
0:26:46,3 --> 0:26:49,73
see. I'll tell you about it -- and started
looking at him.


382
0:26:49,73 --> 0:26:51,97
And he has a really great, creative, unusual
act.


383
0:26:51,97 --> 0:26:56,49
He's amazingly talented.
And he just seemed perfect right away.


384
0:26:56,49 --> 0:26:59,61
Our big fear was, is he available, because
he's very much in demand.


385
0:26:59,61 --> 0:27:3,19
He had some other commitments, but he was
really into doing this and moved his schedule


386
0:27:3,19 --> 0:27:5,56
around.
And it's been a great fit, because I think


387
0:27:5,56 --> 0:27:12,57
people -- the other thing I want to do with
this tour is open up people's minds a little


388
0:27:12,57 --> 0:27:18,2
bit in a way so that there are people who
have preconceived ideas about what I do, and


389
0:27:18,2 --> 0:27:21,21
then they see some of the things we're doing
in the show and they see some of the things


390
0:27:21,21 --> 0:27:24,72
that are happening, and I think it will --
 I mean, we have some older people that are


391
0:27:24,72 --> 0:27:28,65
coming to the show that think, well, I'm going
to see a guy come out and talk about his experience


392
0:27:28,65 --> 0:27:32,1
at "The Tonight Show."
And then they see all the elements we have


393
0:27:32,1 --> 0:27:37,78
in the show and the kind of performance level
there is, and people like Reggie Watts come


394
0:27:37,78 --> 0:27:43,64
out and I think maybe open them up to new
ideas about what comedy is, because he integrates


395
0:27:43,64 --> 0:27:51,559
music, hip-hop, comedy, and creates this,
I think, amazing performance.


396
0:27:51,559 --> 0:27:56,24
He really gets the crowd going before I even
set foot on stage.


397
0:27:56,24 --> 0:27:59,94
>>Vic Gundotra: Cool.
>>Conan O'Brien: Okay.


398
0:27:59,94 --> 0:28:1,8
You're fired.
[ Laughter ]


399
0:28:1,8 --> 0:28:4,5
>>Conan O'Brien: You really want to ask this
question now?


400
0:28:4,5 --> 0:28:6,28
Because he just lost his job.
>>> Yeah, yeah.


401
0:28:6,28 --> 0:28:7,95
I actually have two questions.
>>Conan O'Brien: Nope!


402
0:28:7,95 --> 0:28:13,5
You have to combine them into one question.
>>> Okay.


403
0:28:13,5 --> 0:28:15,68
I'll try my best.
>>Conan O'Brien: No.


404
0:28:15,68 --> 0:28:16,87
You'll do better than that.
[ Laughter ]


405
0:28:16,87 --> 0:28:22,12
>>> So one of my favorite things --
>>Conan O'Brien: This isn't Yahoo!, you know.


406
0:28:22,12 --> 0:28:24,309
We expect the best.
Ha-ha-ha.


407
0:28:24,309 --> 0:28:32,19
>>Vic Gundotra: No reflexes, remember?
>>> So one of my favorite things about the


408
0:28:32,19 --> 0:28:33,61
return, or, rather, you taking over "The Tonight
Show" was the return of Andy.


409
0:28:33,61 --> 0:28:38,64
I was wondering if you could talk --
>>Conan O'Brien: Why don't we have Andy talk


410
0:28:38,64 --> 0:28:39,8
about Andy.
He's here.


411
0:28:39,8 --> 0:28:44,84
Andy Richter.
[ Applause ]


412
0:28:44,84 --> 0:28:59,1
[ Cheers and applause ]
>>> Andy Richter: Hello.


413
0:28:59,1 --> 0:29:0,72
It's about time!
Right there.


414
0:29:0,72 --> 0:29:4,8
>>Vic Gundotra: You know what, you can have
this water.


415
0:29:4,8 --> 0:29:8,11
>>Andy Richter: Okay.
No, I don't want any water.


416
0:29:8,11 --> 0:29:11,42
Kirkland?
>>Conan O'Brien: What is Kirkland water?


417
0:29:11,42 --> 0:29:14,0
>>Andy Richter: It's Costco water.
[ Laughter ]


418
0:29:14,0 --> 0:29:18,97
>>Andy Richter: I'm sorry, Mr. O'Brien.
You're drinking Costco water.


419
0:29:18,97 --> 0:29:22,82
>>Conan O'Brien: This is ridiculous.
>>Andy Richter: I know.


420
0:29:22,82 --> 0:29:25,39
>>Conan O'Brien: Did you see they made me
dance?


421
0:29:25,39 --> 0:29:27,73
>>Andy Richter: I saw it.
>>Conan O'Brien: Then a woman made me run


422
0:29:27,73 --> 0:29:31,9
up against her head.
>>Andy Richter: I know.


423
0:29:31,9 --> 0:29:35,37
That's why I was standing by the door.
I was so -- I was humiliated for you.


424
0:29:35,37 --> 0:29:39,45
No, I actually was just back, standing outside
the bathroom, because I think your assistant


425
0:29:39,45 --> 0:29:41,47
is in there front-cleansing.
[ Laughter ]


426
0:29:41,47 --> 0:29:52,15
>>Andy Richter: Our tour manager, our tour
manager said, "You've got to check out the


427
0:29:52,15 --> 0:29:57,6
Japanese toilets."
So I just was in the bathroom to look, 'cause


428
0:29:57,6 --> 0:30:3,52
I've seen them before, and they -- there's
buttons on the wall, "front cleansing," "rear


429
0:30:3,52 --> 0:30:4,41
cleansing."
[ Laughter ]


430
0:30:4,41 --> 0:30:7,52
>>Conan O'Brien: What is -- I've never heard
of this before.


431
0:30:7,52 --> 0:30:13,24
>>Andy Richter: It's like a little bidet.
>>Conan O'Brien: I understand that part.


432
0:30:13,24 --> 0:30:15,809
I don't understand, why do they have this
at Google?


433
0:30:15,809 --> 0:30:22,43
Why am I asking you?
"Cleansing is necessary.


434
0:30:22,43 --> 0:30:30,54
All Googlers must front-cleanse."
>>Andy Richter: I hope you enjoyed Twitter


435
0:30:30,54 --> 0:30:35,23
 -- those Twitterers' filthy asses.
>>Conan O'Brien: I did.


436
0:30:35,23 --> 0:30:39,62
>>Andy Richter: I want to see it say "filthy
asses."


437
0:30:39,62 --> 0:30:44,9
Look, it does!
[ Applause ]


438
0:30:44,9 --> 0:30:50,84
>>Conan O'Brien: What a great -- Turn this
up.


439
0:30:50,84 --> 0:30:54,29
Turn -- Put this mike up a little bit.
It's getting low.


440
0:30:54,29 --> 0:30:57,6
I just -- I love that that's what we're using
the technology for.


441
0:30:57,6 --> 0:31:0,42
You know.
>>Andy Richter: So I was in the bathroom,


442
0:31:0,42 --> 0:31:5,96
and I hear -- I think it was your Sonne (phonetic),
assistant screaming in the women's room.


443
0:31:5,96 --> 0:31:10,799
>>Conan O'Brien: There she is.
There she is!


444
0:31:10,799 --> 0:31:17,36
>>> Are you front-cleansed?
[ Laughter ]


445
0:31:17,36 --> 0:31:27,36
>>Conan O'Brien: This is either the best or
worst thing that's ever happened at Google.


446
0:31:27,36 --> 0:31:30,59
It's not anything in between.
>>> Wait.


447
0:31:30,59 --> 0:31:34,33
>>Conan O'Brien: More questions.
>>> This is perfect for my follow-up question.


448
0:31:34,33 --> 0:31:39,47
Here at Google, we're interested in seeing
what the next big thing is, a little insight


449
0:31:39,47 --> 0:31:42,74
into the future.
I was curious if you could give us some insights


450
0:31:42,74 --> 0:31:48,57
into the year 2000.
[ Applause ]


451
0:31:48,57 --> 0:31:56,78
>>Conan O'Brien: The future Conan?
>>> There's always cue cards for that, though.


452
0:31:56,78 --> 0:32:1,179
You think --
>>Conan O'Brien: You think we're spontaneously


453
0:32:1,179 --> 0:32:3,9
funny?
>>> No way.


454
0:32:3,9 --> 0:32:7,13
>>Conan O'Brien: "Google merged with Blabble
and form Gibble Gabble."


455
0:32:7,13 --> 0:32:16,45
"In the year 2000."
Yeah, we -- I was once -- I was on an airplane


456
0:32:16,45 --> 0:32:21,7
once, and the plane was taxiing for the takeoff.
It was a commercial flight, back in the day,


457
0:32:21,7 --> 0:32:24,88
just kidding -- I fly commercial.
But, anyway, -- not like the rest of you,


458
0:32:24,88 --> 0:32:29,429
who have your jet packs.
But I was on this commercial flight, and I


459
0:32:29,429 --> 0:32:32,679
hear the guy, the pilot, is just, like, getting
ready to take off.


460
0:32:32,679 --> 0:32:36,55
And he went, "We're all ready to take off,
and I understand there's someone here on the


461
0:32:36,55 --> 0:32:40,35
plane, a very special person who can tell
us a little bit about" -- and then he went,


462
0:32:40,35 --> 0:32:45,14
"In the year 2000."
And then started to, like, put the engine


463
0:32:45,14 --> 0:32:48,87
into overdrive to take off.
And I lost complete confidence in the pilot.


464
0:32:48,87 --> 0:32:52,96
[ Laughter ]
>>Conan O'Brien: At this crucial moment.


465
0:32:52,96 --> 0:32:57,34
He's, like, making his jokes, "In the year
two -- shit, I didn't check the altimeter."


466
0:32:57,34 --> 0:33:2,87
[ Laughter ]
>>Conan O'Brien: Then later, they check the


467
0:33:2,87 --> 0:33:9,55
black box, and it's my fault, you know.
But, anyway, to answer your question, Andy


468
0:33:9,55 --> 0:33:16,51
was in Los Angeles, and I called him up when
I had the chance -- and I said, Andy, you


469
0:33:16,51 --> 0:33:20,32
have to come on board, because "The Tonight
Show," it's a franchise, no "The Tonight Show"


470
0:33:20,32 --> 0:33:23,49
show has ever been sacked.
It's a sure thing.


471
0:33:23,49 --> 0:33:27,55
[ Laughter ]
>>Conan O'Brien: Drop what you're doing and


472
0:33:27,55 --> 0:33:30,88
come with me.
>>Andy Richter: I said, I'm now a tenured


473
0:33:30,88 --> 0:33:33,179
professor in show business.
>>Conan O'Brien: Yes.


474
0:33:33,179 --> 0:33:35,89
>>Andy Richter: No way they can fire me.
>>Conan O'Brien: Yeah.


475
0:33:35,89 --> 0:33:39,95
And you went out and bought a theme restaurant.
>>Andy Richter: That's right.


476
0:33:39,95 --> 0:33:44,79
And it was -- it was all the skipper from
"Gilligan's Island."


477
0:33:44,79 --> 0:33:46,75
It was all -- That was the theme.
>>Conan O'Brien: Yeah.


478
0:33:46,75 --> 0:33:52,1
And now you're impoverished, and here we are.
But the important thing is, we stuck together.


479
0:33:52,1 --> 0:33:54,99
And now what it's really -- that's what it's
about, kids, you have a friend, stick by him,


480
0:33:54,99 --> 0:33:59,41
and he'll stick by you.
>>> Even though I did leave you back in the


481
0:33:59,41 --> 0:34:3,46
nineties.
>>Conan O'Brien: To go hang with Pat Sajak.


482
0:34:3,46 --> 0:34:13,5
>>Andy Richter: As it was once written, I
was seeking prime-time stardom.


483
0:34:13,5 --> 0:34:19,379
That was what was written about me.
And I was, like -- I don't remember ever thinking,


484
0:34:19,379 --> 0:34:21,859
"Sorry, Conan, I'm going to go seek prime-time
stardom."


485
0:34:21,859 --> 0:34:26,289
>>Conan O'Brien: You did say that to me, and
then jumped out the window.


486
0:34:26,289 --> 0:34:29,319
>>Andy Richter: Yep.
I was taking a lot of pills in those days.


487
0:34:29,319 --> 0:34:31,649
>>Conan O'Brien: This gentleman right here,
how can I help you?


488
0:34:31,649 --> 0:34:39,98
>>> Gentlemen, we miss you.
>>Andy Richter: We're right here.


489
0:34:39,98 --> 0:34:44,59
Like my mom, she cries two days before she
has to leave because she has to leave in two


490
0:34:44,59 --> 0:34:47,599
days.
>>> There's something important I want to


491
0:34:47,599 --> 0:34:49,499
point out.
It is Cinco de Mayo.


492
0:34:49,499 --> 0:34:58,509
So where are Noches De Pasion?
>>Conan O'Brien: I look forward to the return


493
0:34:58,509 --> 0:35:4,339
of Conando.
I don't know what the deal is, actually.


494
0:35:4,339 --> 0:35:10,9
I'll be honest with you, it's legally unclear
what can come with us to TBS and what can't


495
0:35:10,9 --> 0:35:18,509
because of certain intellectual property issues
that we address in the -- in the live show.


496
0:35:18,509 --> 0:35:24,39
But I think there's no holding Conando back.
I've been walking around Los Angeles, and


497
0:35:24,39 --> 0:35:28,93
I've had many, you know, people come up to
me and just, like, oh, Conando.


498
0:35:28,93 --> 0:35:29,4
>>Andy Richter: That's how you're known.
[ Laughter ]


499
0:35:29,4 --> 0:35:37,79
>>Conan O'Brien: Yeah, and I speak enough
Spanish to be able to say, "Si."


500
0:35:37,79 --> 0:35:41,79
>>Andy Richter: And he always keeps a fake
mustache in his pocket.


501
0:35:41,79 --> 0:35:45,609
>>Conan O'Brien: Yes, I glue it on, which
looks really funny over the red beard.


502
0:35:45,609 --> 0:35:49,21
I love Conando.
He's a lot of fun.


503
0:35:49,21 --> 0:35:52,609
My favorite part is Andy's cameo.
He's always in a humiliating outfit.


504
0:35:52,609 --> 0:35:58,989
>>Andy Richter: Yep.
I think I was going to be a -- no, I -- or


505
0:35:58,989 --> 0:36:4,39
was I an actual taco?
>>Conan O'Brien: That's just a dream you had.


506
0:36:4,39 --> 0:36:5,22
[ Laughter ]
>>Andy Richter: No.


507
0:36:5,22 --> 0:36:9,559
Because it was always, like, are you going
to be like in a Carmen Miranda outfit, are


508
0:36:9,559 --> 0:36:18,45
you going to be dressed as a giant -- I can't
think of the word -- those things you shake,


509
0:36:18,45 --> 0:36:22,47
maraca.
>>Conan O'Brien: There are a lot of things


510
0:36:22,47 --> 0:36:27,669
you shake.
>>> In the Conando world.


511
0:36:27,669 --> 0:36:33,45
>>> Thank you very much.
>>Conan O'Brien: Thank you for bowing to us.


512
0:36:33,45 --> 0:36:34,95
>>> Little tip for you all, might want to
bow.


513
0:36:34,95 --> 0:36:37,809
>>Conan O'Brien: I bow to you as well.
Hello.


514
0:36:37,809 --> 0:36:39,94
How are you?
>>> I'm good.


515
0:36:39,94 --> 0:36:41,64
Thanks.
>>Conan O'Brien: Okay.


516
0:36:41,64 --> 0:36:45,66
>>> Okay.
This is going to be really bizarre, and I


517
0:36:45,66 --> 0:36:51,43
acknowledge that I probably won't be able
to look anybody in the eye after asking this.


518
0:36:51,43 --> 0:36:53,65
But I was wondering if you could settle a
long argument with my friends.


519
0:36:53,65 --> 0:36:55,809
So one of my friends from school did dorm
crew, and he was cleaning out what he thought


520
0:36:55,809 --> 0:37:0,99
used to be one of your rooms, and he found
a big ball of hair that he thinks was yours.


521
0:37:0,99 --> 0:37:3,44
[ Laughter ]
>>Conan O'Brien: Wait.


522
0:37:3,44 --> 0:37:5,28
Okay.
Will you --


523
0:37:5,28 --> 0:37:6,51
[ Laughter ]
>>> So --


524
0:37:6,51 --> 0:37:9,769
[ Laughter ]
>>Conan O'Brien: You've got to be a little


525
0:37:9,769 --> 0:37:12,249
more specific.
Let's get really specific here.


526
0:37:12,249 --> 0:37:17,559
What year was this and what college?
>>> Well, this was, like, three years ago.


527
0:37:17,559 --> 0:37:21,27
>>Conan O'Brien: So -- 'cause I hate to shatter
any illusions --


528
0:37:21,27 --> 0:37:23,63
[ Laughter ]
>>Conan O'Brien: -- you have about my age,


529
0:37:23,63 --> 0:37:27,579
but I graduated from college in 1985.
>>> No, I know.


530
0:37:27,579 --> 0:37:30,329
This is --
>>Conan O'Brien: So this person thinks that


531
0:37:30,329 --> 0:37:32,43
I made a giant ball of hair --
>>> Yes!


532
0:37:32,43 --> 0:37:36,859
>>Conan O'Brien: -- and spun it and then left
it in the Holworthy dorm at Harvard?


533
0:37:36,859 --> 0:37:38,38
>>> This is what I'm saying.
It doesn't make any sense.


534
0:37:38,38 --> 0:37:43,23
>>Conan O'Brien: And then put it -- and everyone
was so horrified by it that from 1985 until


535
0:37:43,23 --> 0:37:51,759
three years ago, no one went near it, and
then your friend found it and did a DNA test.


536
0:37:51,759 --> 0:37:56,799
>>> I know.
His name is Jim.


537
0:37:56,799 --> 0:38:0,15
>>Conan O'Brien: Oh, Jim.
Yes, yes!


538
0:38:0,15 --> 0:38:7,42
That's all I needed.
No, I grew a giant ball of hair for Jim.


539
0:38:7,42 --> 0:38:10,569
And left it for him to find at the Holworthy
dorm.


540
0:38:10,569 --> 0:38:14,789
Just next time say Jim.
That's all you had to do.


541
0:38:14,789 --> 0:38:17,859
I've heard -- one of the things I'll tell
you, you've probably experienced this, too,


542
0:38:17,859 --> 0:38:24,29
Andy, is what happens when you become a known
person is you start hearing all these things


543
0:38:24,29 --> 0:38:27,79
back about yourself that are complete madness.
[ Laughter ]


544
0:38:27,79 --> 0:38:31,96
>>Conan O'Brien: I went to my -- one of my
high school reunions, and people were coming


545
0:38:31,96 --> 0:38:35,92
up to me and saying things that were just
completely untrue.


546
0:38:35,92 --> 0:38:39,569
And this one guy -- about our past.
This one guy came up to me, and just so you


547
0:38:39,569 --> 0:38:44,19
know, I'll never -- I'll have like a glass
of wine or two or three now, but I'm not a


548
0:38:44,19 --> 0:38:47,239
drinker.
And I never drank at all when I was young


549
0:38:47,239 --> 0:38:53,539
or in college, ever.
And this guy came up to me, and he said, "Hey,


550
0:38:53,539 --> 0:38:57,999
Conan, remember the time you and I broke into
that liquor store late at night?"


551
0:38:57,999 --> 0:39:0,42
And I said, "No, no, no."
And he went, "Come on, we broke into the liquor


552
0:39:0,42 --> 0:39:5,67
store and we grabbed all that booze, and then
the cops showed up, and we ran up that hill,


553
0:39:5,67 --> 0:39:9,42
and you were, like, 'I'm get fucking out of
here,' and you took the booze, and then later,


554
0:39:9,42 --> 0:39:14,91
you drank all the booze, and I didn't get
any of it, you asshole, you."


555
0:39:14,91 --> 0:39:18,44
And I said, "That didn't really happen."
"Okay. I get it. Big star now.


556
0:39:18,44 --> 0:39:25,869
I get it. I get it."
Now, in his mind, that really happened.


557
0:39:25,869 --> 0:39:30,63
And I've never committed a crime in my life.
I am Richie Cunningham to the tenth power.


558
0:39:30,63 --> 0:39:37,66
I've never -- And so I have had many things
come back to me where people -- I had a Realtor


559
0:39:37,66 --> 0:39:41,739
once say, you know, he's showing me, like,
an apartment that I was going to rent.


560
0:39:41,739 --> 0:39:45,71
And he was, like, just so you know there are
no hard feelings, I married your old girlfriend.


561
0:39:45,71 --> 0:39:48,43
And I said, oh, really?
And I haven't -- it's not like -- I hate to


562
0:39:48,43 --> 0:39:52,64
disillusion people, I haven't had that many
girlfriends in my life, I said, really, was


563
0:39:52,64 --> 0:39:55,18
it blah, blah, blah?
And he said, no, come on, Stacey.


564
0:39:55,18 --> 0:40:0,39
And he told me her full name.
Never heard of this person before in my life.


565
0:40:0,39 --> 0:40:4,519
He said, come on, I know you two went out
for a year and a half.


566
0:40:4,519 --> 0:40:7,73
But he said, it's okay.
I'm cool with it.


567
0:40:7,73 --> 0:40:14,859
So what happens is I've --
>>> That's what really drew him to her, too.


568
0:40:14,859 --> 0:40:17,14
>>Conan O'Brien: I know.
>>> Is getting your sloppy seconds.


569
0:40:17,14 --> 0:40:22,239
>>Conan O'Brien: Yeah, I know.
And then he was like, she had Conan.


570
0:40:22,239 --> 0:40:24,21
She has the ball of hair.
[ Laughter ]


571
0:40:24,21 --> 0:40:28,779
>>Conan O'Brien: Damn!
You got me.


572
0:40:28,779 --> 0:40:32,539
But the truth is that you've had this, too,
like, people just come up and they say --


573
0:40:32,539 --> 0:40:38,72
 and 95% of what I hear is madness.
Really, just madness, like, hey, a friend


574
0:40:38,72 --> 0:40:41,109
of mine saw you kick a guy to death in Hong
Kong.


575
0:40:41,109 --> 0:40:44,88
[ Laughter ]
>>Conan O'Brien: And I've learned to just,


576
0:40:44,88 --> 0:40:51,259
instead of fighting them, I just go, yeah,
well, that Dick had it coming, you know, like,


577
0:40:51,259 --> 0:40:53,559
go with it.
Go with it.


578
0:40:53,559 --> 0:40:58,349
So, yes, say hi to Jim and sell that hair
ball on eBay.


579
0:40:58,349 --> 0:40:59,559
Yes.
>>> Okay, thanks.


580
0:40:59,559 --> 0:41:3,65
>>> Conan, last year, you were at the International
Science and Engineering Fair.


581
0:41:3,65 --> 0:41:6,97
>>Conan O'Brien: Yes, I was.
>>> In Reno.


582
0:41:6,97 --> 0:41:11,999
And this year, it's next week, it's in San
Jose, and Google is the premier sponsor.


583
0:41:11,999 --> 0:41:14,16
If we promise you some swag, will you come
again?


584
0:41:14,16 --> 0:41:17,39
>>Conan O'Brien: I would love to come.
I had a blast last year.


585
0:41:17,39 --> 0:41:22,39
I -- and she shot a remote for "The Tonight
Show" when I went and talked to all the kids.


586
0:41:22,39 --> 0:41:25,14
And I absolutely loved it.
The tour is going to prohibit us from doing


587
0:41:25,14 --> 0:41:29,349
it just because I am hitting -- I was in Reno
last night.


588
0:41:29,349 --> 0:41:32,999
We're here today.
We're in -- I don't even know -- am I in Sacramento


589
0:41:32,999 --> 0:41:34,41
tomorrow?
>>> Sacramento tomorrow.


590
0:41:34,41 --> 0:41:36,349
>>Conan O'Brien: Sacramento tomorrow.
It's just, we go, go, go, go.


591
0:41:36,349 --> 0:41:40,299
We're in a different city all the time.
So I probably won't be able to do it.


592
0:41:40,299 --> 0:41:45,359
But I absolutely loved it.
And the -- the exhibits ranged from just amazing,


593
0:41:45,359 --> 0:41:49,7
it gave you hope for our country.
These kids are so smart, and they have these


594
0:41:49,7 --> 0:41:52,59
incredible projects.
Then there's every now and then you'd find


595
0:41:52,59 --> 0:41:56,17
a project which was just such bullshit.
[ Laughter ]


596
0:41:56,17 --> 0:41:59,339
I'm not being mean, but every now -- most
of them are amazing.


597
0:41:59,339 --> 0:42:4,99
Then there would be a guy who had, like, a
potato with tooth picks in it and, like, a


598
0:42:4,99 --> 0:42:8,859
sprout growing out the bottom.
And he'd say, "It's a potato with water on


599
0:42:8,859 --> 0:42:11,46
it."
And you know that he just did this to get


600
0:42:11,46 --> 0:42:15,849
the hell out of his town and get to Reno.
And his exhibit's next to a guy who's, like,


601
0:42:15,849 --> 0:42:22,279
I split the hydrogen atom.
Using a sneaker in my basement.


602
0:42:22,279 --> 0:42:26,129
And you're, like, "Oh, my God."


603
0:42:26,129 --> 0:42:28,769
Yes.
>>> Andy, Conan, great to have you guys here.


604
0:42:28,769 --> 0:42:32,17
I just want to say, Andy, your shoes are awesome,
by the way.


605
0:42:32,17 --> 0:42:35,749
>>Andy Richter: Oh, thank you.
I designed them myself.


606
0:42:35,749 --> 0:42:42,9
Although some dick at the gym said, "What
are those, Nobi shoes?"


607
0:42:42,9 --> 0:42:44,279
But, no.
>>Conan O'Brien: I just meant it as a joke.


608
0:42:44,279 --> 0:42:47,14
>>Andy Richter: They're super awesome shoes
is what they are.


609
0:42:47,14 --> 0:42:51,16
>>> They are.
So, Conan, I was curious, do you have any


610
0:42:51,16 --> 0:42:55,18
thoughts on working with the comic geniuses
Terrance and Phillip in the "South Park" movie.


611
0:42:55,18 --> 0:42:58,759
What was that like?
>>Conan O'Brien: It was so funny, because


612
0:42:58,759 --> 0:43:3,99
I found out later on that I was in the "South
Park" movie.


613
0:43:3,99 --> 0:43:6,289
I remember exactly -- this is just what my
life is like.


614
0:43:6,289 --> 0:43:9,46
My girlfriend at the time, Stacey, whatever
 --


615
0:43:9,46 --> 0:43:14,45
[ Laughter ]
>>Conan O'Brien: Okay.


616
0:43:14,45 --> 0:43:20,67
I hit that, you know.
[ Laughter ]


617
0:43:20,67 --> 0:43:24,39
>>Conan O'Brien: But -- such an ass.
My girlfriend at the time and I --


618
0:43:24,39 --> 0:43:27,349
Look, there's this big screen that says, "You
have five minutes to go."


619
0:43:27,349 --> 0:43:33,359
Why?
Why can't we stay as long as we want?


620
0:43:33,359 --> 0:43:36,759
Why?
>>Conan O'Brien: You have some --


621
0:43:36,759 --> 0:43:42,119
>>Andy Richter: We'll be taken to the vaporization
chamber and head on to the next level.


622
0:43:42,119 --> 0:43:44,259
>>Conan O'Brien: "That is all that's acceptable."
[ Laughter ]


623
0:43:44,259 --> 0:43:47,94
>>Conan O'Brien: We --
>>Andy Richter: So you didn't know you were


624
0:43:47,94 --> 0:43:50,64
in the --
>>Conan O'Brien: What happened is, I remember


625
0:43:50,64 --> 0:43:54,829
exactly what happened, which is, I had one
of my rare vacations, which I never get, and


626
0:43:54,829 --> 0:43:58,79
I went to Maine with my girlfriend at the
time.


627
0:43:58,79 --> 0:44:4,279
And it's this beautiful place that's on a
lake, and you go and get breakfast in the


628
0:44:4,279 --> 0:44:7,829
morning and coffee, and someone had a -- 
and they, like, put down a "U.S.A. Today"


629
0:44:7,829 --> 0:44:9,609
next to you.
And I'm sitting there drinking this coffee,


630
0:44:9,609 --> 0:44:13,19
and I open up the "U.S.A. Today," and it's
a review of the "South Park" movie, and it's


631
0:44:13,19 --> 0:44:16,839
saying it's really funny.
And it has a box, which is the list of who


632
0:44:16,839 --> 0:44:20,63
plays who.
And it has all the different names of people,


633
0:44:20,63 --> 0:44:25,45
then it says, "Conan O'Brien is played by."
And my jaw just dropped.


634
0:44:25,45 --> 0:44:30,39
And I said, "There's this movie opening, and
I'm in it, and they got the" -- fortunately,


635
0:44:30,39 --> 0:44:32,599
it was really funny.
Actually, we're both in it.


636
0:44:32,599 --> 0:44:37,99
It's this funny thing where they come on the
show to talk to us, and then I end up committing


637
0:44:37,99 --> 0:44:38,5
suicide.
But it was really --


638
0:44:38,5 --> 0:44:41,619
[ Laughter ]
>>Conan O'Brien: Happens a lot when I'm animated.


639
0:44:41,619 --> 0:44:45,489
But it was really funny, and I loved it.
And I got to know those guys later on.


640
0:44:45,489 --> 0:44:50,9
And they said, "We're really sorry about your
voice in that movie."


641
0:44:50,9 --> 0:44:53,729
And I said, what.
They said the guy who played Data on that


642
0:44:53,729 --> 0:45:1,19
"Star Trek," whoever that guys is, he convinced
them, "I do the most amazing Conan O'Brien."


643
0:45:1,19 --> 0:45:3,71
And they're like, "Cool.
Okay.


644
0:45:3,71 --> 0:45:5,64
Great."
And that's why -- one of the reasons they


645
0:45:5,64 --> 0:45:10,15
worked me in, is 'cause he convinced them
that he did a drop-dead perfect Conan O'Brien.


646
0:45:10,15 --> 0:45:16,99
And then he got into the booth and he was
like, "Your next question!"


647
0:45:16,99 --> 0:45:19,96
And Matt and Trey are like, "Look at that."
But it was too late.


648
0:45:19,96 --> 0:45:20,339
So --
[ Laughter ]


649
0:45:20,339 --> 0:45:23,94
>>Andy Richter: Well, I liked that they were,
like, "Well, there's nothing that can be done


650
0:45:23,94 --> 0:45:24,52
about it."
>>Conan O'Brien: Yeah, I know.


651
0:45:24,52 --> 0:45:27,269
[ Laughter ]
>>Conan O'Brien: But I -- once --


652
0:45:27,269 --> 0:45:30,559
>>Andy Richter: "It's been recorded."
>>Conan O'Brien: Once you know Matt and Trey,


653
0:45:30,559 --> 0:45:36,119
you know they were probably, "Whatever, good
enough."


654
0:45:36,119 --> 0:45:38,989
But, yeah, I love those guys.
Actually, "Team America" is one of my favorite


655
0:45:38,989 --> 0:45:46,109
movies of all time.
It makes me relentlessly -- I just cry, I'm


656
0:45:46,109 --> 0:45:48,759
laughing so hard.
>>> Best fight scenes, best sex scenes.


657
0:45:48,759 --> 0:45:53,819
>>Conan O'Brien: Yes.
>>> I was hoping both of you could tell us


658
0:45:53,819 --> 0:45:58,599
the weirdest thing that's happened to you
on the live tour.


659
0:45:58,599 --> 0:46:2,19
>>Conan O'Brien: There's been a lot of weird
stuff.


660
0:46:2,19 --> 0:46:8,59
>>> No, I can't -- you know.
I stay in my room a lot.


661
0:46:8,59 --> 0:46:12,71
>>Conan O'Brien: I think maybe for me the
weirdest thing is, just before I went out


662
0:46:12,71 --> 0:46:17,549
and did a show in San Francisco, someone leaned
exposure said, "Hey, Neil Young's in the audience."


663
0:46:17,549 --> 0:46:23,13
And I play guitar in this show.
And so I don't get nervous a lot.


664
0:46:23,13 --> 0:46:26,589
I've been doing this a long time.
But I suddenly realized that I'm going to


665
0:46:26,589 --> 0:46:34,44
be playing rock guitar in front of Neil Young.
And I was horrified.


666
0:46:34,44 --> 0:46:39,39
And then there's a part of the show where
I take a guitar solo and just before I take


667
0:46:39,39 --> 0:46:44,779
it, I see it was one of those accidents, but
I see, like, a shaft of light hitting Neil


668
0:46:44,779 --> 0:46:46,819
Young's face.
[ Laughter ]


669
0:46:46,819 --> 0:46:53,479
>>Conan O'Brien: You know, looking up at me.
And I don't know what the equivalent is, writing


670
0:46:53,479 --> 0:46:56,419
code in front of Bill Gates or something.
[ Laughter ]


671
0:46:56,419 --> 0:46:59,839
>>> No way.
>>Conan O'Brien: See, I know what's going


672
0:46:59,839 --> 0:47:3,489
on.
>>Vic Gundotra: Conan, we're going to have


673
0:47:3,489 --> 0:47:5,319
to cut this short.
>>Conan O'Brien: You don't have to do anything.


674
0:47:5,319 --> 0:47:14,2
These people don't have to work today.
You all have to go home!


675
0:47:14,2 --> 0:47:15,39
[ Applause ]
>>Conan O'Brien: You've done more than enough


676
0:47:15,39 --> 0:47:18,789
for this company!
Are they writing that part?


677
0:47:18,789 --> 0:47:26,359
In fact, you should all participate in a profit-sharing
plan with Google.


678
0:47:26,359 --> 0:47:28,29
Yes!
[ Applause ]


679
0:47:28,29 --> 0:47:36,39
>>Vic Gundotra: Guys, we appreciate --
>>Conan O'Brien: I like it says "applause."


680
0:47:36,39 --> 0:47:47,4
[ Cheers and applause ]
>>Conan O'Brien: Hey, just a quick note, this


681
0:47:47,4 --> 0:47:52,67
was really fun, and we get asked to do a lot
of things, and we don't really have time to


682
0:47:52,67 --> 0:47:56,9
do a lot of things.
But getting in front of young people who are


683
0:47:56,9 --> 0:47:59,66
really smart and sort of making the future
happen, that's thrilling for us.


684
0:47:59,66 --> 0:48:1,63
So thanks for having us here.
Thank you very much.


685
0:48:1,63 --> 0:50:1,63
[ Cheers and applause ]
