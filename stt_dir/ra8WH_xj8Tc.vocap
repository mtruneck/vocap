###13 EDDIE: Didn't nobody see that I bonged it into the bowl.
###16 
###23 EDDIE (NARRATING): What's up?
###23 It's your boy Eddie Huang-- chef, writer, human panda,
###26 Bang Bros connoisseur, and I'm horny for more.
###29 EDDIE: We tripping, man.
###30 EDDIE (NARRATING): If I had to explain "Fresh Off the Boat,"
###31 I'd say that it's a cultural show told through the lens of
###34 food, putting on voices that have long gone ignored.
###38 Fuck with the human panda, this is "Fresh Off the Boat."
###52 EDDIE (NARRATING): Today we're headed to the Bay Area to hang
###54 with some barbers and the Rice Paper Scissors crew.
###56 But first it's off to Oakland to shoot some rabbits with the
###59 East Bay Rats.
###61 EDDIE: Let's shoot some guns.
###62 Let's kill some rabbits.
###63 Let's do this.
###64 TREVOR: Cool.
###64 Done.
###65 EDDIE: All right?
###66 
###82 TREVOR: All right, let's take a walk.
###83 You guys stay up here and practice.
###87 EDDIE: So you--
###87 I mean, this is not just a hobby.
###89 It's kind of a lifestyle for you.
###91 Instead of going to market, you by shells, you drive, you
###94 come out here and do it.
###95 TREVOR: Yeah.
###95 EDDIE: All the way.
###96 TREVOR: I eat a lot of food out of here.
###98 I come up here every Sunday to hunt.
###101 I started planting fruit trees.
###101 And eventually I'll just eat what's off of here.
###104 People that eat meat and aren't willing to kill an
###106 animal are fucking pussies.
###107 And fuck them.
###109 
###112 Bang bang.
###113 
###118 EDDIE: Got him.
###120 How do we do this.
###121 How do we get these--?
###122 TREVOR: Hopefully we see some rabbits down here.
###123 And we'll walk down here and sneak in,
###124 and see what happens.
###126 
###132 EDDIE: Should we stand somewhere in particular?
###134 
###138 Where is he?
###141 [RAPID SUCCESSION OF GUNSHOTS]
###145 Are those all your friends up there?
###147 TREVOR: Yeah.
###147 EDDIE: They're all in the bike gang and stuff?
###148 TREVOR: No, not at all.
###149 You'll meet the bike club after this.
###151 What I was saying before is I've been teaching all these
###153 hipster kids from the coffee shops how to hunt and shoot.
###157 Trying to get the next generation coming.
###159 And just the fact that everybody's moving from the
###161 country to the city, it's a whole nother movement.
###163 All these skills are being lost.
###164 
###170 Nobody younger than us is hunting.
###173 Nobody's applying for hunting licenses.
###174 And it's just the whole thing's changing.
###177 People don't do it.
###178 That's the whole thing.
###178 Teach them gun safety now and then they'll get it.
###181 EDDIE: I'm holding this properly, right?
###182 TREVOR: You're good--
###183 EDDIE: On the back, yeah?
###183 TREVOR: As long as you don't point it at me or anybody
###184 else, were happy.
###187 EDDIE: Just so the viewers know.
###188 TREVOR: Kind of the bottom line.
###189 EDDIE: Point it up and away, down and away.
###192 Whoa.
###193 TREVOR: Ooh.
###194 
###196 EDDIE: Yo, so do you have, like, a stunt
###198 rabbit for this show?
###199 You know, one we could let loose.
###203 TREVOR: I've got some rabbits that I raise, and I wonder how
###205 they'll taste.
###206 EDDIE: Yeah?
###206 TREVOR: We could pull it out and kill it.
###208 Billy, you wanna kill a rabbit?
###209 With your hands?
###210 BILLY: Yeah.
###210 Want to grab one?
###211 TREVOR: You've got to eat the heart.
###213 BILLY: I will.
###215 EDDIE: Which one are you going to pull out?
###216 BILLY: This guy right here.
###217 EDDIE: OK, perfect.
###218 BILLY: Whitey.
###219 TREVOR: Whitey.
###220 [LAUGHS]
###221 We're going to kill Whitey.
###222 EDDIE: Kill Whitey.
###223 Kill Whitey!
###224 
###267 I'm a man who--
###269 I have no problem killing shrimp.
###271 I have no problem killing a crab.
###272 I have no problem killing a fish.
###274 I'll drop a live lobster in a pot of boiling water and not
###277 think twice about it.
###278 But I have a moral inconsistency.
###280 Because watching that rabbit die under that dude's knee--
###285 And we knew for weeks that we were going to come watch
###289 Trevor either shoot a wild rabbit or slaughter a rabbit
###292 that he raised for slaughter.
###293 And still, our crew was not emotionally prepared and did
###297 not know how they were going to feel.
###300 Tough, right?
###300 MALE SPEAKER: I still want it.
###301 EDDIE: And now you don't feel so tough.
###303 MALE SPEAKER: No.
###303 EDDIE: We're so cut off from the process of slaughter.
###306 We're not reminded.
###307 We don't see the image every day.
###309 This enables these companies and these people, and even
###313 places like my restaurant to sell you more animal protein
###316 than you would actually eat if you were reminded and were
###319 conscious of what had to go down.
###323 It'd be hard to sell as much meat as people in America buy
###328 if there were someone playing a video out front of a grocery
###330 store, like this is what happened.
###334 It's not a game.
###335 
###339 MALE VOICE (OFFSCREEN): Don't worry about the fur.
###340 BILLY: Yeah, he just seemed like dumbshit the
###342 whole time I was--
###342 MALE SPEAKER: Can I just shoot shit still, or no?
###344 
###351 EDDIE: What's up, Trevor?
###351 TREVOR: Hey, hey, man.
###353 EDDIE: How you guys going to cook the rabbit?
###355 TREVOR: So she decided to bread it, buttermilk it, and
###358 deep fry it.
###359 EDDIE: Nice.
###361 Is she from the South?
###362 Because I see this cast iron skillet.
###364 TREVOR: No, she's from New Jersey.
###365 But she's been working at a Southern restaurant, so I
###368 think she's got her technique down.
###370 Hell yeah.
###372 TREVOR'S GIRLFRIEND: Wild rabbit is a little
###373 bit gamier, for sure.
###375 This is rabbit that we've been raising and feeding in a cage,
###378 so there's a ton more meat and a lot more fat on it.
###381 EDDIE: Try this.
###382 This looks good.
###383 A rabbit tender over here.
###385 
###388 It's like a mix of chicken and gator.
###390 TREVOR: Yeah.
###391 
###393 Thank you very much for the rabbit.
###395 It was delicious.
###396 You got skills with that skillet.
###397 Thank you for having us.
###398 TREVOR: All right, man.
###399 Good stuff.
###399 Come by any time.
###400 EDDIE: Thank you so much for that, man.
###401 We'll see you soon.
###402 
###409 EDDIE (NARRATING): Every time I eat meat now, I have to be
###413 conscious of the fact that I am choosing to enable someone
###417 to kill an animal and create a market demand for slaughter.
###421 And I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
###424 You just have to be conscious with the choice you make.
###426 Every time you eat meat, just remember that bunny's head
###430 fucking falling off.
###433 You know?
###434 And if you can still eat, more power to you, man.
###437 Do you.
###438 But I will try as long as I can to keep that image in my
###443 mind, because I don't want to be unconscious of
###445 what's going down.
###448 "Fresh Off the Boat" with Eddie Huang.
###450 We out.
###450 FUBU.
###451 For us, by us food show, kid.
###453 A'ight?
###455 
###457 EDDIE (NARRATING): Next up on "Fresh Off the Boat," we're
###459 headed to San Francisco's Mission District to grow
###461 cephalopods on the block with the Rice Paper Scissors crew.
###463 
###466 EDDIE: We need this in Chinese school.
###467 You know, man?
###468 These Chinese kids don't use their dicks till they're 40.
###471 [LAUGHTER]
