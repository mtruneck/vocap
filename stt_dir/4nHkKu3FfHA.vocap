###3 Let's welcome Ted Zoller to Sanford. Thank you, Tom. Thanks a lot.
###11 So my job today is, I think, primarily to entertain, right.
###15 If I'm boring you in this lecture, I'm doing the wrong thing.
###19 I'm aware of that.
###21 The other thing is I would fully expect with this kind of brain
###23 power in this room that you would just interrupt me, right.
###28 So I fully expect you all to challenge some of my thinking,
###31 maybe bring up your own ideas.
###33 Throw me off balance everyone once in a while.
###36 I will hope that you'd be willing to do that.
###38 I'm very privileged to be here, as you could expect.
###41 But I know you're very privileged to be here as well.
###44 This is one of the finest institutions.
###46 If not the finest institution of higher education
###48 and I'm going to prove it today.
###50 Today I actually have empirical data that shows Stanford's place
###54 in the sun and why you should be very proud to be here.
###57 So this is what I'm planning to do.
###59 I wanted to share with you just a few ideas on whether
###62 or not you think that you're fully networked.
###65 I think it's somewhat appropriate that today Facebook IPO, right.
###71 Facebook announced that they were going to go for an IPO, right.
###74 So this is a pretty important day.
###75 But you should be asking yourself whether or not you're networked
###78 in the way to fuel your entrepreneurial future?
###81 And I will show you a few ideas that you should start to think
###84 about as you're putting together your professional path.
###87 So I'm prepared to answer five questions today.
###89 The five questions start with,
###92 what are the ingredients ultimately of a high impact entrepreneur?
###96 Ultimately, why is Silicon Valley the very best
###99 place in the world to be an entrepreneur?
###101 Thirdly, how do I take fullest advantage of my
###104 time at this institution to gain an advantage.
###107 I think it's important for all of you.
###109 This is a precious four years of your life,
###112 if you are an undergraduate.
###113 Two or three years, if you're a graduate student.
###116 And if you're a PhD student,
###117 you're probably going to be indentured for the next 20 years.
###121 That's my full expectation.
###123 Then what path will likely lead to my success while I'm here?
###126 Taking full advantage of that.
###128 And then lastly, I will prove to you why is it -
###130 why is that Stanford bill completely worth it?
###133 That's probably more of a question that your parents
###136 would like to have the answer for, right? So there you go.
###139 So starting with the first one,
###140 what are the ingredients of high performance entrepreneurship?
###143 You know it occurs to me in the work that I've had - I've had
###144 the privilege of working with entrepreneurs all my life,
###146 I was an entrepreneur earlier in my life and I now
###149 have worked now with hundreds of entrepreneurs.
###151 I've had a lot of great success in working and enjoying their
###155 stories and one of the reasons why I love Silicon Valley is,
###158 it's a place of real attitude.
###161 Starts out with maybe the character of a Steve Jobs,
###165 the attitude of a Vinod Khosla, right.
###170 Here is Hewlett Packard, in front of the iconic garage, right.
###174 How many of you think about garage entrepreneurship,
###175 that all started here. And that is the garage that's on the actual
###181 list of historic places as a matter of fact.
###184 Andy Grove, he is the model of persistence, right.
###189 And then of course the Google guys.
###191 We're talking about the cool factor.
###193 And of course why I love Silicon Valley is Stanford University,
###197 can we all say, absolutely right?
###200 But the truth is - the secrets of entrepreneurship
###203 is literally everywhere.
###204 It's everywhere where you are, everywhere worldwide.
###206 I know that this is being broadcast all over the world now and everyone
###211 who is watching this podcast is surrounded by entrepreneurs.
###214 Just want to tell a few stories.
###215 There is a person Amit Singh, he is one of my heroes.
###219 Amit was in my class four years ago and now has a company
###223 that's in the top three fastest growing companies in
###225 the North - in the Southeast of the United States.
###228 He started literally as a programmer in a cube,
###233 now has 700 employees over three continents and
###236 literally has all the equity of the company.
###238 He never had to raise money to build that company.
###241 Now that's an entrepreneur.
###244 Here is Ryan Stone.
###245 Ryan Stone came to me about seven years ago and said,
###247 Ted, you know what I want to do? I want to start a new airline.
###251 My first reaction was oh, my god. Holy shit.
###254 This is not what you want to be starting,
###256 this is the worst possible - he said hold on, hold on.
###259 I have a really great business model.
###261 I want to link with high growth companies that see
###263 aviation as a strategic advantage and now he is
###266 flying a fleet of 10 of the fastest aircraft.
###270 He hadn't had to spend a dollar on building that network.
###273 And as a matter of fact,
###274 now he is running that airline and it's extraordinarily powerful.
###278 Again, a great entrepreneur, who's build a great business model.
###283 Here is Monica Tomasso. Monica is also my hero.
###286 She was really interested in trying to change the
###289 nature of nutrition in the K-12 environment.
###292 We are feeding our kids garbage and she wanted to change that.
###297 She has been shipping over 2,500 lunches
###299 to K-12 students in the mid-Atlantic and uses
###303 it as for passion to drive this message home.
###307 These three guys, have you ever seen the movie Office Space?
###310 Right.
###311 You know that movie,
###311 remember that scene with - when they take out the printer or
###315 with bat and they just hammer that printer with the bat.
###319 That was the mantra of these three gentlemen.
###320 They were all sitting in cubes at Cisco System.
###323 They decided they wanted to change their lives,
###325 they started a microbrewery.
###327 That microbrewery has been widely successful,
###329 a company called Lonerider.
###331 That is still their mantra, they're having more fun today.
###333 Again, they all through in $25,000
###335 a piece and now are free cash flow.
###339 These two fellows who I'm very,
###340 very proud of, Tom Fischer on the right is one
###342 of the foremost scientists in blood sciences.
###346 He has come up with lyophilized platelets. You know platelets?
###350 We usually donate it like you would donate your blood,
###353 when they last for a few days because they spoil.
###357 He has come up with a way to freeze dry platelets.
###359 But what's interesting about this story is the guy in the left,
###362 Stan Eskridge, great entrepreneur.
###365 Doesn't know anything about science, he'd be the first one to admit,
###368 I'm the farthest you can get from being a scientist.
###370 He said, you know it would make a lot of sense if we could
###373 actually put those platelets and embed them in a textile.
###376 And they came up with a field dressing that could actually be
###378 mounted in front of a person who has large hemorrhagic wounds.
###383 And guess what that product is being used in the
###385 front lines in Afghanistan to help our soldiers.
###388 So those are my heroes, right.
###390 We can talk about the great athlete with the great speed.
###393 But these are entrepreneurs who are all around us.
###396 These are entrepreneurs that are in this room, right now.
###398 These are the entrepreneurs that inspire me.
###402 So, Dr. Byers has probably hammered this into your head.
###406 Where does great entrepreneurship start?
###408 Usually with innovation, right. It starts here. It doesn't end here.
###412 Let me just explain what I'm talking about.
###415 How many of you have at least one idea,
###416 that you could act on in your lifetime.
###418 You have one idea that you want to turn into a start-up company.
###420 How many? Raise your hand.
###422 Keep them high, don't put your hands down, okay.
###425 How many of you have three ideas? If you don't, drop your hands.
###430 How many of you have five ideas?
###433 Alright. How many of you have 10 ideas.
###437 Now these are really sick people. We need to study these people.
###440 These people are - keep your hands high, you should be proud of that.
###443 Now we need to understand these people because these
###446 are the people who can - please put your hands down,
###449 but we're going to celebrate you all.
###451 Because these are the people that fuel the future.
###454 But we have to unlock their potential.
###457 They come up with great transformative ideas everyday.
###460 But as you know entrepreneurship is
###462 about taking action on those ideas,
###464 making those ideas visible, rendering them available.
###468 So it's not enough to start with the idea,
###470 you have to start with the idea, but you have to act on the idea.
###472 And how many of you, just for curiosity's sake,
###475 how many of you can act on more than one idea at one time.
###479 Okay, raise your hands?
###480 Okay, how many of you are working with three ideas at one time?
###483 Anybody, how you're doing it? I know how you're doing it.
###489 Please, yeah. Yeah, I have three companies at the
###492 moment and switching between them.
###496 Right.
###496 And is your role different in those companies,
###498 are you the founder of all three, or are you the CEO of all three.
###501 Two of them. Two of them. And the last one is partnership. Okay.
###505 The third one is a partnership. So you're getting leverage.
###507 You're making ideas available and all these
###509 ideas are now taking root, right. These ideas are making it happen.
###514 So it's very common for entrepreneurs to
###517 find different ways to find leverage.
###519 You don't have to found the company necessarily to have impact.
###522 Your ideas need to be put into motion.
###525 That's what entrepreneurship is all about.
###527 So, if I updated that picture, I guess it would look like this.
###529 You all can do better than that, can't you?
###531 Let's do better than that. Oh, my God, so that's the best we can do.
###535 So, this is one of oldest ideas known to man,
###538 since Plato, right: necessity is the mother of invention.
###541 I'm really extremely bullish about the future of our world
###544 because we have gigantic challenges and we have your generation
###548 who is serious about solving those challenges.
###550 I'm really excited about the future of entrepreneurship
###552 because I honestly think that's one of the key
###554 answers to society's greatest problems, but it started with Plato.
###559 So, in many cases you start with the innovation, but it's not enough,
###563 you have to build something on top of that
###565 and that typically is the insight.
###567 That insight is how that innovation actually takes root,
###571 how it has impact, why it's meaningful.
###573 And I'd argue the type of entrepreneur that starts
###575 with the innovation usually is what I call an
###578 "innovation-based entrepreneur".
###579 But there is another typology of entrepreneurship,
###582 as a matter of fact that starts in a very different way.
###584 How many of you would start this way,
###585 start with the idea and then start to find a market for it?
###589 And maybe, okay, a lot of you are raising your hands.
###591 I think that's a typical modality, right?
###594 Ideas are inherently valuable,
###596 but ideas that are applied are invaluable.
###598 I would suggest that ideas that are left on your
###601 list that are not acted on are valueless.
###604 These are ideas that need to be released,
###606 make them available to society, don't leave them behind.
###610 I can't tell you and I bet some of you have been in that
###613 situation where some of the best ides you've had,
###615 you see someone else implement, you've that experience, right?
###619 You just let the world just pass you on by because
###621 you hadn't had the time to make it happen.
###623 Think about that leverage, the individuals who are doing two,
###626 three, four ideas at a time or working with teams of
###629 people to actually make these concepts available.
###632 You know, emulate them. Make that happen.
###636 The second piece is a game-changing solution.
###637 This is an ingredient that's really critical
###639 to high-performance entrepreneurship. What do I mean by that?
###643 Ultimately, as you look and this is a great illustration of all the things
###646 that are happening in the software and the web environment here,
###649 in the social media environment,
###650 and that it occurs to me that it's almost
###651 a daunting set of solutions, right?
###656 Which solutions are going to actually make their way through?
###659 You know, many of these started with, just like you started,
###661 an idea, but many of these solutions need
###663 to find their impact in the market.
###666 Only a few will make it through, right?
###668 There are certain applications,
###670 for instance, certain concepts that end up becoming platforms
###674 and then becoming kind of central to our lifestyles, right?
###678 It occurs to me when you look at your smartphone,
###680 for instance, how many of you have over 100 applications
###683 on your - apps on your iPhone now?
###685 Can I ask? More than 100 apps? Pretty common.
###688 How many do you use on a typical day?
###691 One, two, three, right, am I right?
###693 How many of you are developing apps, I'm just curious?
###697 How many of you are developing apps as we speak? Okay.
###699 What's it going to take to make yours a game-changing app?
###703 Think about it. What is it going to take to become a game-changer?
###707 That is what it's going to take.
###709 You've got to dial-in the notion of need,
###712 how ultimately is that need being satisfied,
###714 how is that pain ultimately being mitigated?
###719 I would argue that the intersection of opportunity
###721 and need is where the entrepreneur needs to live.
###723 Opportunity is the most exciting type of platform
###727 an entrepreneur lives in their life,
###729 but need ultimately crystallizes it. That's the acid test.
###734 I would argue that there's a class of entrepreneurs,
###736 you might be surprised by this, they don't start with an idea at all,
###739 they start maybe with the market try to understand
###742 what the problems are that we all face.
###744 As they're reading the blogs or as they're going through
###747 the web or as they're reading the newspaper,
###749 believe it or not, in the morning, they actually see compelling need.
###752 And on top of that, they define a real customer in their mind.
###756 They see a customer, I call that the beachhead.
###759 That need is critical. And I would argue that kind of entrepreneur
###762 is a marketplace entrepreneur.
###763 They don't start with the innovation,
###765 they start with the problem and then they
###767 acquire innovation to solve the problem.
###769 These are conjoined and they match.
###773 So, the market is my wisest teacher.
###776 Honestly, the market will tell you whether or not your idea is going
###779 to gain relevance because people will walk with their feet.
###782 The market is a beautiful crystallizing test,
###785 launch and learns where it's better than learn and launch,
###787 you know, I saw that Steve Blank was here,
###788 for instance, absolutely true,
###791 they're bringing the market into the equation much earlier.
###794 Will help you test your ideas to see if
###795 they actually will make their way through.
###798 Okay, so let's bring these two concepts together;
###800 the market, the innovation.
###802 On top of the market,
###803 you have the beachhead and top of the innovation,
###805 you have the insight.
###805 What do you suppose is at that intersection point?
###810 We all said this word, right? It's a value-prop.
###814 That value-prop is the driver.
###817 It is ultimately how you are going to make
###819 the decisions you're going to make, as to how you use your time.
###822 Now, I see that as a function of expert entrepreneurship.
###825 So, for those of you who start with the innovation;
###827 balance it by looking at the market and the need.
###829 For those of you who start and don't have original ideas,
###831 and I'm guessing not many of you are like that,
###833 but can I ask you, are there any folks in here that have
###836 never had an original idea in their entire life?
###839 Seriously? Is there anybody in here?
###842 There's got to be one brave soul, let's say, you know,
###844 to be honest with you,
###845 I'm in the middle of all these brilliant people and I don't know,
###847 squat, you know, but I know how to help people who have ideas.
###851 There is no one in this room? Fascinating.
###855 Fascinating, I guess it's not surprising. Are you that guy?
###858 Okay, alright, thank you, Tom. Thank you for helping me out.
###862 Alright, the third part of the strategy here is that that
###864 you have to be able to execute and execution is critical.
###868 Execution is the function of actually putting your ideas in motion.
###873 When you have something so complicated
###875 that people don't understand it, you're doing the wrong thing.
###878 The best business models are usually the most simple business models.
###881 The ones you can communicate, the ones you can actually evangelize.
###885 These are the ones that actually can
###886 bring people to follow you, right? So, avoid complexity?
###891 Your left brain kind of function, I'm this kind of person,
###894 I love to get underneath it - I love to get underneath
###896 the - to look underneath the hood,
###899 I want to tinker with the engine, right?
###901 Engineers love to tinker with the engine, am I right?
###904 You're the operating guy. You want to figure out how it works.
###907 You want to take a part and make it better usually, right?
###910 But there is another kind of entrepreneur,
###911 believe it or not, and most of them are sitting
###912 over the business school right now, right?
###915 And I would call them right-brain entrepreneurs.
###917 These are the people that will say, Ted, you know, seriously,
###920 you're spending all your time trying to figure this thing out,
###923 and you're just wasting your time,
###925 this isn't worth doing it, you don't do it. Why would you do that?
###929 I tend to enjoy this and I always disdain the term vulture
###932 capital because it suggests that money is evil. Money is your tool;
###939 you should embrace that concept in order
###941 to make your ideas available, right? Make your ideas available.
###944 So, don't be afraid of money because money is ultimately the tool.
###948 Somebody wrote a piece in the Huffington Post and someone
###951 wrote a post responding to it and they said,
###954 you know, money is like manure, just spread it around,
###957 make things grow faster.
###958 Yeah, that is the point, you know, I can understand that.
###962 But I want you to just challenge yourself when you
###964 look at that and I find this with engineers a lot.
###968 When you look at that glass, how many of you see a glass half-empty?
###972 You see the potential of it, but you need - you see it half-empty.
###976 Can you raise your hand? How many of you see it half-empty?
###979 How many of you see half-full? You're optimistic, right?
###983 I would argue that when are you when you're building a great venture;
###985 you want to take advantage of the people
###987 who are both optimists and pessimists,
###990 individuals who can ask all the right questions.
###993 So, the people that raised their hands,
###994 saying I see it as a glass half-empty,
###996 they are the ones that are well of knowledge of what are
###1000 the barriers you need to overcome to make it successful.
###1003 You want a game-changing solution, find that opportunity.
###1007 So, discovering that business model will allow
###1009 you to soar over some of the key challenges,
###1011 some of the key barriers and vet that opportunity.
###1014 Okay.
###1015 So you bring your business model together,
###1017 you balance it with your financial model.
###1019 On top of your business model, your strategy, you attract leadership,
###1022 the people that you would implement with your business model.
###1025 The financial model you bring;
###1026 the tools and implementation,
###1027 all the assets you need to build your venture, right? Guess what
###1031 else that intersection? Think you can guess?
###1033 It's a value-prop, right? That's a function of execution.
###1037 These are the things you do after you are in motion,
###1039 after innovation the market comes together.
###1041 So, let's try to understand this as a system.
###1043 It also occurs to me that entrepreneurs don't think,
###1047 as we've learned from Sarasvati, strategically.
###1051 They are very opportunistic.
###1052 They start with an insight,
###1054 they add to it an understanding of a customer,
###1057 they try to understand how you can bring other people into the
###1059 equation by assembling people around the idea with leadership,
###1062 and they see all the assets and bring it together,
###1066 again, informed by the value-prop, right?
###1068 That's how the entrepreneur usually starts.
###1070 They don't think top-down, they think bottom-up.
###1074 So, let's bring it all together.
###1077 The market, innovation and top of the market,
###1080 the beachhead and top of the innovation,
###1081 the insight, you have the business model,
###1083 financial model, add to it leadership,
###1086 add to the financial model your implementation,
###1088 all structured around the guiding principle of the value-prop.
###1091 Again back up in the 1980s - back in the 1980s,
###1093 I used to have a shirt looks just like that,
###1096 I'm surprised I am not wearing it still today.
###1098 But that's the way I look at entrepreneurship.
###1101 In many ways that this model actually captures many of
###1104 the ways people approach entrepreneurship and that you
###1106 have to integrate these elements into your thinking.
###1109 Not everyone on your team,
###1111 by the way, has everything on this picture.
###1115 You have to build a team that fills out the full equation.
###1120 Alright, what's the next piece? Let's look for a leapfrog strategy.
###1123 You know not one of your entrepreneurial efforts will be successful
###1126 if it incrementally improves the market opportunity.
###1129 Very difficult to build the business on an incremental improvement,
###1133 you really need a leapfrog strategy and it occurs to
###1135 me many of you probably admire these two guys, right?
###1139 I admit. I'm a geek. I'm a trekkie.
###1143 Unfortunately, my trekkie was this, right.
###1146 These two guys, you know, little old school realize that.
###1149 A lot of ways, you know,
###1150 the generational gap is starting to really show up in my life,
###1152 you know, every day.
###1154 But it occurs to me,
###1154 I remember when I was watching these two fellows and,
###1157 Spock was in the cabin and he was playing three-level chess.
###1161 And I just remember this, it scored in my mind.
###1164 So I was thinking to myself,
###1165 a great entrepreneur doesn't play checkers, they don't play chess,
###1170 they play chess on three levels.
###1173 You think about what Steve Jobs did, for instance.
###1175 You know, everyone talking about Steve Jobs,
###1177 but this is the person who had something locked and loaded,
###1179 ready to go while he was implementing the thing
###1181 that was already rocking our world, right?
###1184 He was playing three levels as opposed to his
###1187 competitors who are barely playing checkers,
###1189 if not emulating the possibility of playing chess at his level.
###1193 So that three level chess game is something
###1196 you have to be thinking about.
###1198 And honestly, a leapfrog strategy is thinking how the world adapts,
###1203 how it evolves and what's going to happen in the future
###1205 when you make educated hunches how to make that happen.
###1209 That results in not an incremental improvement but a leapfrog,
###1213 or league improvement.
###1215 And by the way that's my Captain Kirk. It's kind of sad, isn't it?
###1219 I love William Shatner, but boy that ages me, ouch, right?
###1224 The next piece is serendipity.
###1225 And I can't really teach you this, but serendipity plays a huge role,
###1229 and you now I disdain the idea that entrepreneurs
###1231 are lucky and it's all about luck. I don't think that's true at all.
###1235 Entrepreneurs take advantage of serendipity.
###1238 Let me explain what I mean.
###1240 I know so many entrepreneurs who are like the Forrest Gump's,
###1243 you know, remember the scene when he was meeting
###1244 John F. Kennedy and he'd already met,
###1246 and I guess President Johnson or vice versa.
###1249 He said; I have to go to the White House again, right?
###1252 So, you know, this idea of serendipity is so interesting to me
###1257 because entrepreneurs put themselves in a position to be lucky.
###1261 They put themselves in a position to be fortunate. Why?
###1265 To prepare their minds to take full advantage
###1268 of that opportunity when it presents itself.
###1272 So, here's Louis Pasteur, chance favors the prepared mind, right?
###1276 Have you ever thought to yourself for a moment?
###1279 Have you prepared yourself to be fortunate?
###1282 Have you prepared your thought pattern,
###1285 your action agenda so that when that opportunity presents itself,
###1289 you're ready to grab it?
###1291 Have you prepared yourself for that moment?
###1294 And it occurs to me that when we talk about luck,
###1297 we eat Google fortune right now,
###1298 you know what shows up first on Google, when you Google fortune?
###1303 That picture. That's sad.
###1305 Vanna White is their idea of fortune, right?
###1308 And many of us think about the roulette wheel.
###1310 I was going through an airport.
###1313 I was at Heathrow Airport as a matter of fact.
###1315 And this young lady was watching all the
###1317 bags go through the x-ray machine.
###1319 And they turned - she turned to one of our
###1321 colleagues and said Black 7 is my future. Black 7 is my future.
###1326 And I was listening and while she was talking all the bags were flying
###1329 by and she wasn't even looking at them and like, oh, my god.
###1332 That's my future, but I don't want to listen in.
###1334 She said I am going to go this weekend and blow all of my weeks' pay,
###1339 play at the casino on Black 7.
###1341 And I thought to myself,
###1343 oh, man, this is a young lady who really hasn't
###1346 learned what fortune is all about, right?
###1349 Let me share with you what I think it is,
###1351 and by the way I don't think Harvard has got it right either.
###1353 Harvard Business School has this concept of the cash wheel,
###1355 the profit wheel and the ROE wheel.
###1356 They don't get it. The ideas of fortune really come from the ages.
###1363 As a matter of fact,
###1364 I would argue the Eastern traditions and philosophy probably
###1366 have retained and captured those ideas better than the West.
###1370 We've lost these ideas.
###1372 The best way I can explain it, would be to use Niccolo Machiavelli.
###1376 He wrote a great book called The Discourses.
###1378 Has anyone here who read The Discourses?
###1381 Right. How many people have read, The Prince? Right.
###1385 Go back and read The Discourses and
###1386 I saw one person raise their hand,
###1387 you raised it again proudly, right. The Discourses was a great book.
###1390 And this was written when he was in prison,
###1392 de' Medici had put him in prison. It was an angry, angry book.
###1396 He talked about fortune as a set of wheels.
###1399 And those wheels were turning in different directions,
###1401 in different velocities.
###1404 And a fortunate person is the person who jumps from wheel to wheel to
###1408 wheel to wheel at the right moment and makes progress in their life.
###1412 How many of you are sitting on that wheel right now,
###1415 when the opportunity presents itself and
###1417 you're just going to stay on it, right?
###1419 An entrepreneur makes the move.
###1422 One thing I had to learn as an entrepreneur,
###1424 frankly, was to make the move.
###1428 I wasn't prepared. I had to think everything through.
###1430 I had to plan everything. Before I know, my competitors are already
###1434 four steps down the road testing it out, trying it, making it happen,
###1438 while I'm still thinking about it, right? So just hear me out.
###1443 The seventh element, durable sustained profit, right?
###1448 We talk a lot about profitability.
###1451 But profit is a real key piece,
###1452 because ultimately we're talking about the resources
###1454 that allow you to reinvest in your own opportunity.
###1457 And I love particularly recurring revenues.
###1460 You know why I love recurring revenues?
###1463 Because ultimately that's a durable business.
###1465 I'm looking not only for the one-time revenue opportunity
###1468 where am able to sell something and they always say,
###1471 the dog eats the dog food.
###1472 I hate that term, but boy it's absolutely true.
###1474 But the dog continues eating, right?
###1477 This is a business that's going to continue to be sustainable.
###1480 It'll allow you to be successful, right?
###1483 So we've talked a lot about the lifecycle of a business,
###1486 every one of the concepts you have when you're building
###1488 it into a business has an investment period, right?
###1491 That J-curve we all talk about. Well the truth is;
###1494 the J-curve is not one event, its multiple events.
###1497 You have to break that big investment period down into smaller bite size
###1500 units and then align capital ultimately will make you successful.
###1506 We talk a lot about the business model but in many cases some
###1508 of the key cognitive barriers that you put up in front of yourself
###1512 actually become the reason you're not successful.
###1514 Try to find the business model ultimately that's going
###1516 to allow you to optimize the opportunity in the market.
###1520 Don't try to find something so complicated
###1522 you can't ultimately get it to work.
###1525 It occurs to me that, Ronald Coase, great Nobel prize Laureate.
###1531 Noble Laureate in economics,
###1533 came up with transaction cost economics, right?
###1536 Some of his insights, I think actually bear a lot of interest in
###1539 terms of finding the right business model.
###1542 He talked about optimizing on three levels;
###1544 search, contracting and coordination, the cost of finding things,
###1548 the cost of acquiring things and the cost of managing things.
###1552 We're looking at optimizing on all three levels.
###1555 Try to think about business models who allow
###1556 you to optimize on all three of those levels.
###1559 It occurs to me that you all face opportunities in your lifetimes
###1564 that your parents and grandparents could not have conceived of.
###1567 Largely because, you have business models available
###1569 to you that your parents never experienced, right?
###1574 So this becomes a tremendous opportunity for you all.
###1579 I'm just giving you a lot to think about.
###1582 And I'm just going to pause here for a moment.
###1584 Anyone who want to challenge me?
###1586 Anybody who want to raise a question or make a point?
###1591 Please. You mentioned preparing yourself to sort of
###1596 be ready for an opportunity when it comes.
###1598 Did you have any particular types of preparation in mind?
###1602 So, that's difficult.
###1604 So you want to find out what degree to go get,
###1606 you need to go to Harvard Business School and figure it out.
###1609 As a matter of fact, I honestly think that,
###1611 I am falling in love with apprenticeships,
###1613 falling in love with following people who think entrepreneurially.
###1617 I think it's a mindset, but I also think it's a pattern of action.
###1621 And when you're preparing yourself,
###1623 I think you prepare yourself intellectually
###1625 like you are going to school now.
###1626 But you prepare yourself for digging into
###1629 the details of building a great business.
###1631 And in many cases, really look to emulate the
###1634 patterns of people who do it successfully.
###1636 I am really thrilled that Tom is bringing in tremendous
###1638 entrepreneurs who you get exposed to,
###1640 because these are your teachers.
###1642 You have two teachers, the people that you could understudy with,
###1645 and I've had mentors my entire life that I've admired,
###1648 but the market also brings a lot of clarity.
###1651 Does that answer your question?
###1654 Any other questions, please.
###1656 You mentioned several friends at the beginning of your presentation.
###1659 What was that airline called, that you're... Jetpool.
###1662 Jetpool, it's based in Charlotte, North Carolina. He got very lucky.
###1665 Very fortunate guy, Ryan Stone.
###1668 Ryan had this idea in his mind that companies really needed aviation
###1674 as a strategic tool and you know who partnered with him first?
###1678 Have you ever heard of the company Nucor?
###1681 It's a steel company. It uses a series of micro-mills.
###1685 Why do they need aviation?
###1686 They have these mills on all these small locations
###1690 that are served by municipal airports,
###1692 and a Citation X can land on a short runway.
###1696 And all of their plant managers move around
###1698 in this network of micro-mills. So this company;
###1701 one of the most successful steel companies in the United States,
###1703 leverages Jetpool as its tool of advantage.
###1707 The day that the GM executives all landed to work with Congress,
###1712 that was a good day for Jetpool.
###1714 Let me tell you, because everyone wanted to get
###1715 rid of their aviation departments, right?
###1718 Alright. Please. How does globalization both help and hurt us?
###1723 That's a difficult question.
###1724 Globalization, we've all agree that globalization
###1727 is now something we've embraced.
###1730 This is now an integrated economy and people
###1733 have to learn to see the world now,
###1736 not just as a local market, not just as a regional market,
###1739 not as a national market but as an international or global market.
###1744 There will be changes that will naturally have to happen because this
###1748 is a tremendous transformation we're going through economically.
###1752 People will win, people will lose. It will make us sharper, honestly.
###1757 Did you see the thing Steve Ballmer put out, I think a Bloomberg,
###1760 the last issue of Bloomberg Businessweek.
###1763 He talked about how when Microsoft was always in the lead,
###1766 he didn't have to try very hard but now that
###1769 they are lagging in several industries;
###1771 they are now becoming entrepreneurial again.
###1774 It's something that really gave me a lot of
###1775 faith because as you are challenged further,
###1779 I think you become greater at acting entrepreneurially.
###1782 Any other questions, please.
###1784 You indicated that a lot of the opportunities are
###1786 a function of meeting a need in the marketplace.
###1790 In the next four years,
###1791 it's estimated that 80% of the growth and wealth in the world
###1794 will happen outside of the United States and Western Europe
###1798 and where the average income is roughly $3,000 a year.
###1802 I suspect the problems they're trying to solve
###1804 are something that we have no knowledge of. So how do we participate?
###1809 This is one of the best opportunities I think we face because it challenges
###1813 us to think through paradigms that we operate within the West.
###1816 For instance, does healthcare have to be expensive.
###1820 I've been really inspired by some of the
###1822 healthcare leaders that are saying,
###1823 look we are going to act forcefully to serve other people.
###1829 I think we are going to change fundamentally some of the ways
###1831 that we operate and the years of haves and have-nots,
###1835 I think is going to break down.
###1837 I honestly think that we're changing fundamentally
###1839 our economic paradigm right now.
###1841 How do we get knowledge about what needs are - that
###1843 what we know how to do might be able to fulfill,
###1847 if we don't in fact have an experience with that need. Right.
###1851 It's not part of our - the thing we've ever dealt with in our lives.
###1856 So I think you're speaking to the converted already.
###1858 How many of you have visited Africa?
###1861 Raise your hand. How many of you have been to the Middle East?
###1866 How many of you have been to either China,
###1867 India or somewhere in the South Pacific?
###1871 We're solving the problem because people
###1873 are learning about these challenges.
###1875 And we have to take it very seriously.
###1878 How many of you are actually doing projects
###1882 in areas outside of the U.S.?
###1886 That's the pattern I want to see.
###1888 It's not tourism, it's not about the Peace Corps going for six months,
###1891 it's about doing something. Right?
###1893 And that's why I am in the entrepreneurship business
###1896 because entrepreneurship is about doing something. Hey, good to see.
###1900 Any other questions? Let me move on, feel free to throw it out.
###1905 So align exit goals.
###1907 There is a big piece of this - to build to sell or build to last.
###1910 You have to find the partners that are going
###1912 to allow you to do what you want to do.
###1914 Some of you are looking to build durable opportunities that
###1917 are actually going to solve world problems and be persistent
###1920 and actually - and that's the built to last kind of thing.
###1922 Isn't it kind of ironic that they are two books out there,
###1924 Built to Sell and Built to Last.
###1926 Jim Collins is the one that everyone knows and then
###1929 John Warrillow on the - went on the Built to Sell side.
###1931 These are different mentalities.
###1933 You have to think through how do you align the strategies
###1936 to get done what you want to have accomplished. Right?
###1938 I am not so concerned about the exit
###1941 as I am about the sustainability,
###1942 the opportunity and meeting the need long-term.
###1946 Stay persistent to meet that need.
###1949 And then lastly, I am going to spend the balance of my
###1950 time with you all today on this concept of deal makers,
###1953 the syndicate and it starts kind of with this idea.
###1956 You've seen LinkSV here in Silicon Valley for instance and
###1959 all the big influencers of venture capital industry and how
###1962 that operates with all the companies that they've helped to
###1964 support here and now has become I think a global phenomena.
###1968 It's very interesting time to be in the entrepreneurship
###1971 business and this is the world's epicenter.
###1975 It occurs to me you all have to think through
###1977 how do you bring these people in your life?
###1978 How do you actually find them?
###1980 How do you bring them into your vision?
###1981 And how do you leverage them to take full
###1984 advantage of the potential that you see.
###1987 We can spend a lot of time there.
###1988 So let me summarize the first part of this.
###1990 So here's the big formula. Right?
###1992 Starts with the idea, then you add the need,
###1995 then you add understanding of a leapfrog strategy,
###1998 add to that a business model that's graceful.
###2001 You have recurring durable revenue model.
###2004 You align exit opportunities.
###2006 You fuse that with a killer syndicatable dealmaker network.
###2011 That's going to add up to a whole bunch of money. Right?
###2014 You won't find this in any Stanford textbook,
###2017 I don't believe but I honestly think that those are some
###2019 of the key elements that you should be thinking about.
###2022 I am going to spend a little time here.
###2026 And how I'm doing in time, Tom? Am I over?
###2031 No. Okay. Thank you.
###2036 So we are going to spend some time on networking.
###2037 I wanted to share with you a few ideas.
###2039 Question two, what makes Silicon Valley the
###2040 best place on earth to be an entrepreneur.
###2043 So you are very fortunate and if you think about all
###2047 the various ways the Silicon Valley plays a role.
###2049 Why is Silicon Valley so successful?
###2052 Obviously, there is a set of theories, it's about innovation. Right?
###2056 There's even concepts of spillovers.
###2057 There is so much innovation that spills over into entrepreneurial
###2060 ventures that kind of catch them like vessels.
###2062 Right? I'm not so sure but that's one theory.
###2066 Second reason is there's piles of cash here.
###2068 A lot of venture capital money. Right?
###2070 People are thinking all those two ingredients kind of come together.
###2072 Mix ideas, put them with a bunch of money, things happen.
###2076 Well, we know better.
###2077 Usually it boils down to PO and VCs aren't heroes,
###2081 ultimately, but they are going to be
###2083 an important key to this ecosystem.
###2087 Then you think about and a lot of my friends who are entrepreneurs
###2089 think about that Ocean's Eleven kind of management team,
###2091 the killer entrepreneurs,
###2093 a combination of teams that are really going to make it happen.
###2095 That's an important ingredient, right.
###2098 And it occurs to me,
###2099 again, the generation kind of thing happens for me.
###2103 This is the Ocean's Eleven of the old days.
###2106 Always wondered why - why is there twelve of these
###2108 guys and this guy I think was sneaking in,
###2109 I am not sure who that guy is, but it's fascinating to me.
###2113 That Ocean's Eleven piece is there,
###2115 but when I was on that plane going to Europe,
###2118 I ran out of juice in my battery and I ran across
###2122 the only thing that there was to read.
###2124 I couldn't sleep, I came across the airline magazine
###2127 and in the airline magazine there is maybe one piece
###2130 of information you want in that thing.
###2132 There was a very interesting article
###2133 about mapping the Internet, right. You've seen all this before.
###2136 You realize that's the first drawing
###2138 of the predecessor of the Internet, it's called the ARPANET.
###2140 So, array of four computers that were done originally for military.
###2145 Well, then they showed the Internet2 mapping
###2146 project and you've seen this map before.
###2150 And these are all the computers that are arrayed in the international
###2153 networks that are available on the Internet.
###2156 When I looked at that picture, I didn't see information intensity;
###2160 I saw a business model opportunity.
###2163 I saw an opportunity for you all to conceive of ventures
###2165 that truly do embrace a global solution.
###2168 Getting back to the question that you had;
###2170 we can use this tool to reach the whole world,
###2174 right, and that we are in many ways.
###2176 We were talking about Moore's Law
###2178 15 years ago and now we are living it. You know, think about it.
###2183 It occurs to me though when I get to the end of that magazine,
###2186 I was flying on some airline, Continental or something,
###2188 these are the five airlines that fly in the U.S.
###2190 and then here is the global picture, right.
###2192 Oops - and look at the nodes here, look at the nodes.
###2195 It occurred to me, we're just as physically connected
###2197 as we are connected through digital source, right.
###2201 So this has huge implications on you as you
###2203 think about your careers and your futures.
###2206 You are now world citizens. You are now world entrepreneurs.
###2209 This whole idea of global entrepreneurship is taking a
###2211 lot of - getting a lot of attention now, absolutely true.
###2217 Curious, how many of you are doing ventures right now?
###2221 How many of you have a venture you are working on right now?
###2223 Extraordinary.
###2225 How many of you started your venture not in the United States?
###2230 I love that, super.
###2232 Okay, entrepreneurship is a global phenomenon,
###2235 by the way, I think you already know that.
###2237 So I've done a little work on looking at dealmakers and I wanted
###2240 to understand kind of the nature of networking and the new frontiers
###2243 that I think are coming between applying network theory and understanding
###2247 the structure of social capital and understanding innovation from
###2250 the standpoint of how firms ultimately take route.
###2254 And I did little work on this and it occurred to me
###2257 in the academic literature there was a real clear
###2259 distinction between entrepreneurs and investors.
###2261 Never understood that distinction because the successful
###2263 entrepreneurs I knew were investors, right.
###2266 There is no clear bright line between those two.
###2269 So I always wondered there was these other people up there
###2271 that kind of fuse those two concepts and they tended to
###2274 be the people that made more and more things happen.
###2276 You might have started as an entrepreneur,
###2277 might have started as an investor but you become something else.
###2281 I don't know, for the lack of a better word,
###2282 I am looking for a better word for those
###2284 of you trying to think about this.
###2286 The dealmakers, the people that actually make things happen.
###2289 And I tried to understand that.
###2290 They broker resources,
###2292 they shape your networks and they syndicate and interconnect, right.
###2295 It occurs to me that there are these people in the
###2297 center that activate the rest of the network, when it works, right.
###2301 And these are the people that I was starting to get interested in.
###2303 I remember about five years ago when the
###2305 economy was starting to climb to a halt,
###2307 it was grinding to a halt, I wanted to get something going.
###2310 And I was thinking to myself who do we need.
###2313 We need the people who have done it repeatedly.
###2315 We might call them serial entrepreneurs,
###2317 you might call them the people who ultimately
###2319 broker deals or what have you.
###2321 These are the individuals that are going to help us make it happen.
###2324 For some reason, they're frozen. They are not doing it anymore.
###2326 Why is that? They're living in kind of a fear.
###2330 So I said, let's figure out something, so I developed this algorithm,
###2334 I guess, it's for lack of - it's a vaunted
###2336 term to call it an algorithm.
###2337 The truth of the matter is, I'm looking for people who have multiple
###2340 positions in entrepreneurial firms, I'm actually stacking them up,
###2344 and then I relate them socially to try to understand
###2346 how they're connected to one another.
###2348 Because I want you as young entrepreneurs to be able to access them,
###2351 right, because that's how you're going to be successful.
###2354 So finding out who the who is.
###2355 The way I do that is I try to understand the entrepreneurs
###2358 and investors and generally there are distinctions
###2360 between those two types of people.
###2361 But as they move up in their career, they have two equity positions,
###2365 three equity positions, four equity positions in firms,
###2368 they become more and more important in seeing
###2371 the network kind of come to life, right.
###2373 So I'm looking at actors within firms,
###2375 within regions using interlocks, very interested in this.
###2379 It occurred to me, I looked at all the tech hotspots and
###2382 back in the '80s we actually had a whole set of theories
###2385 where if we brought all the technologies together,
###2387 entrepreneurship would happen, right.
###2389 And this is a chart that shows the number of firms born
###2391 and it was fascinating to me that when I looked at it,
###2394 Silicon Valley created almost 5,000
###2396 firms over a 20 year period whereas Boston created about
###2398 half that even though in most cases you're equating
###2401 Silicon Valley and Boston as equal parties in entrepreneurship.
###2405 All these other technology regions including my region,
###2407 Research Triangle Park, created less than 1,000, right.
###2411 Ironically where I come from Research Triangle Park has the highest
###2414 density of PhDs over total employees of anywhere in the world.
###2418 Yet, they're not creating that many companies.
###2420 So I was trying to figure that out.
###2423 When I looked at these patterns,
###2424 these are the number of equity positions
###2426 held and you see the numbers on the left, 1 all the way to 30,
###2430 these are the equity positions by each of these regions.
###2432 And I noticed there was a big fat base
###2435 wherever there was nice economies,
###2437 where Silicon Valley was performing
###2438 so well in creating great companies,
###2440 had a lot of entrepreneurs and investors engaged in it.
###2442 Okay, we already kind of knew that,
###2444 but the other pattern I saw on the data that I thought was really
###2446 interesting was there was a really nice fat long tail.
###2449 There were a lot of people who did a lot of things, right.
###2453 Whereas these other regions you never saw those people, right.
###2457 So I started to look at the relationship of dealmakers to the
###2460 performance of regions by way of creating new companies.
###2464 And I founded as a matter of fact,
###2466 statistically the presence of dealmakers was actually
###2470 more correlated to firm birth than the frequency of
###2474 the availability of entrepreneurs and investors.
###2477 So what does it tell you? It occurs to me, that these people are
###2481 usually in the elite, the top 2.7%,
###2484 these are people who have three or more equity
###2487 positions in entrepreneurial firms.
###2489 And in places like the Bay Area, it's 4.5%
###2492 of the population, whereas places like
###2494 Austin, Texas or Denver, it's around 1%, right.
###2498 So something is in the water here, right.
###2501 It occurs to me, these are the people.
###2503 Well I wanted to map the networks and these are
###2504 the networks of these 12 technology hotspots,
###2507 as a matter of fact they're organized by population,
###2509 so the most populous is Boston, the least populous is Austin,
###2513 the lower right hand side.
###2514 If it varied by population,
###2516 you would expect to see the most dense to the least dense, correct?
###2519 What do you see in the pattern of this data?
###2522 You see the most dense or the most intense
###2526 entrepreneurial network in Silicon Valley.
###2529 The third greatest - largest metropolitan area up here
###2531 Phoenix has the weakest entrepreneurial network.
###2533 I was talking to Michael Crow,
###2535 the Chancellor of Arizona State University,
###2536 shown this data, and he said Zoller, how many people are up there?
###2539 And I said about 150 and he said, I'll just have them over the house.
###2543 I want to talk to these guys.
###2545 Well, in places like RTP or Austin or places like that,
###2549 they hang in there even though they're small places.
###2552 Please, question?
###2554 Okay, the data comes ultimately from private transaction data.
###2558 It comes from public databases, like Standard & Poor's.
###2562 And I came up with the software to actually put all
###2565 the data together and then socially relate it.
###2569 Well, what was fascinating is,
###2571 this is the aggregate network of entrepreneurs
###2573 in each of these regions. What does that tell you?
###2575 What two regions other than Silicon Valley and Boston would you
###2577 say are starting to look like hot entrepreneurial networks?
###2581 San Diego. San Diego and Seattle, right.
###2584 Now I'm leaving out some obvious cities because
###2586 these are technology hotspots, right?
###2588 Leaving out some of the key metropolitan areas
###2591 like Los Angeles or New York or Chicago, starting to study those.
###2595 What's ironic is many of those cities because they're
###2597 financial headquarters tend not to be entrepreneurial.
###2599 But you know the stories that are evolving.
###2602 The Groupon founders are really driving an
###2604 entrepreneurial revolution in Chicago.
###2606 Have you all noticed what's happening in New York lately,
###2609 across the bridge in Brooklyn?
###2611 It's unbelievable, there's an entrepreneurial
###2613 revolution going on there.
###2614 But the aggregate networks are just one story.
###2616 I want to know where the dealmakers are? Well, check this out.
###2619 When you screen the aggregate network
###2621 for three or more equity positions, this is the picture you get.
###2625 Silicon Valley, you would still need the Stanford
###2627 Football Stadium to have everybody there, right.
###2630 Boston, you could probably fit them in the Stanford Basketball Arena.
###2633 Whereas in Austin, you could probably get them in this room, right.
###2638 In Phoenix, you could probably get them in
###2639 the classroom we're going next, right.
###2642 When you go to four plus dealmakers look at this.
###2644 You would still need the basketball stadium
###2647 here in time for Silicon Valley,
###2649 whereas in Boston you could probably get them in this room.
###2652 And the people in Phoenix,
###2653 you could probably get them in the front row,
###2656 pretty interesting, isn't it?
###2657 Things aren't all equal when we are looking
###2660 at the performance of regions. So... Excuse me. Yes?
###2663 Did you do anything overseas or is this just relative to U.S.?
###2666 I just finished a project with the OECD in Europe.
###2668 We are looking at all the European headquarters,
###2670 all the headquarter cities. And we are using this as a way to measure
###2673 kind of the performance of networks.
###2676 But I want to do it in Southeast Asia and I just
###2678 met with a group here in Stanford because many of
###2680 the leaders who came up with these methodologies,
###2683 I studied under more or less, so the assets are here.
###2689 Okay. So what does this mean to you?
###2691 How do I take fullest advantage of my
###2692 time in Stanford to gain an edge,
###2694 and I want to use the last 12 minutes with
###2696 you guys to kind of answer that question.
###2700 Recognize in Silicon Valley you've got an extraordinary situation.
###2704 This is Research Triangle Park, their entrepreneurial network.
###2708 All the colors represent the various industries.
###2710 Red is biotech, blue is software and IT,
###2712 green is industrials, orange is energy.
###2715 The circles are the investors.
###2716 The triangles are the entrepreneurs, they're all connected.
###2718 It looks like a really rich entrepreneurial
###2720 network in Research Triangle Park.
###2721 Let me show you the equivalent in Silicon Valley.
###2725 That's the equivalent.
###2727 That's ridiculous, I mean truly ridiculous. Okay.
###2730 Now let's start screening that big hairball. Let's go to 2-plus.
###2734 This is what you got with 2-plus.
###2736 All these people are serial investors and entrepreneurs.
###2739 Let's go to 3-plus.
###2741 Look what it's starting to look like, you can start to see it.
###2743 That's 10-plus, I am sorry, it's ridiculous. Let's go to 15, right?
###2749 Now you're starting to see something, lot of patterns.
###2752 What color is dominant? Blue - all internet, IT, software; fascinating.
###2759 There's some biotech.
###2761 The circles are the big investors,
###2762 the triangles are the big entrepreneurs, right?
###2764 And I'll track back at their history,
###2766 look at their operating history. Let's go to 20-plus;
###2770 these are the dealmakers now.
###2771 And do you see any other color, but blue? Fascinating, isn't it?
###2775 These are all the mega dealmakers here.
###2777 There are 44 mega dealmaker investors with over 20
###2780 equity positions in entrepreneurial companies, 16 mega entrepreneurs.
###2784 And honestly working between investors and entrepreneurs
###2787 at this level is very interesting and these are the
###2788 types of people that you read about, right?
###2792 You can touch these people. How do you touch these people?
###2796 These people are not on your Facebook, right? Some of them are.
###2799 Not all of them. You know, we have to think about that.
###2803 Many of you are connected socially, right?
###2805 A lot of you feel like you're really connected
###2807 socially, you're doing well.
###2808 How many of you have over 200 contacts,
###2811 or connections in either Facebook or
###2812 LinkedIn or whatever you're using?
###2814 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1,000,
###2825 over 1,500, over 2,000, okay? Interesting, isn't it?
###2832 You have to connect to the right people.
###2834 And let me tell you, your life is going to be defined by
###2837 five key connections in your life.
###2840 Five key connections are going to make the difference
###2841 between you being successful or not.
###2844 So, be aware that, you know, Facebook might be the new world order.
###2848 But you have to connect to the people who are doing this work.
###2852 And honestly, this problem is a big challenge, right?
###2857 We've got a big problem because there's the Facebook
###2860 generation and those like me, who are not.
###2863 Don't leave us behind because guess what?
###2867 We still have the keys, you know? Don't you want to take the car out?
###2872 So, be aware of that challenge and make
###2875 sure that you work with us, right?
###2877 Because oldsters are still relevant and we don't get it, you know?
###2882 It's important for us to think about.
###2884 Turn this into your advantage, make this possible, okay?
###2888 What path will lead to my success, I'm going to do this very quickly.
###2892 I did analysis of all the dealmaker pathways,
###2894 and there were bunch of different pathways
###2896 and I'm going to just interpret this,
###2897 this is the hand waving portion.
###2899 I thought for sure most of the people who're really
###2901 successful will start out in investment banking,
###2903 go to business school,
###2904 go to the investment banking world and come back to - get
###2906 their MBA and then get into private equity or get into
###2908 venture capital and become mega financial guys.
###2911 Those are the guys, that's the pathway in the top.
###2913 Then I thought the other pathway would be,
###2915 the person who starts a company,
###2916 then who he starts the second company, who starts the third company,
###2918 serial entrepreneur, that's the pathway at the bottom.
###2921 Then I saw all these other pathways when I was
###2922 studying their backgrounds and it was like, who are these people?
###2924 These are the guys who go to corporations,
###2926 they start working for large companies and then they,
###2929 ironically, as they get senior in their career start
###2931 working for smaller and smaller companies,
###2934 private equity-backed companies or high growth companies,
###2936 they left IBM to go work for some of the companies
###2939 you all admire in Silicon Valley,
###2942 while ironically there was a set of profiles
###2943 that came about by looking at this work.
###2946 And I did this really clever kind of pathway analysis and
###2949 based on that I looked at the centrality of the pathway,
###2952 and sure enough going and becoming a financial
###2954 engineer will lead you to become a dealmaker, but not most likely.
###2959 Being a serial entrepreneur will lead you to be a dealmaker,
###2962 but not most likely. What's the most likely path?
###2966 Getting to the C-suite of a large company
###2968 and then backing into a private company.
###2972 So what we've been saying is, go start a company.
###2975 It's not a bad idea to go work for a company
###2978 and then go fuel a company's growth.
###2981 Is that interesting? Please. Okay.
###2983 Can you cut out years by doing management consulting?
###2987 Well, I think consulting - as a matter of fact,
###2988 consulting is one of these pathways and there's -
###2990 it's actually a very common path.
###2992 This one right here is consulting and services company, so yes.
###2996 The answer is yes.
###2998 I wish it was definitive, but it was an interesting pattern,
###3000 I didn't - that surprised me.
###3002 So don't leave the idea of working for enterprises out.
###3005 I'm not saying go work for the big huge corporations necessarily,
###3009 but learn something that you can leverage ultimately
###3012 in the building of your of entrepreneurial career.
###3014 Okay, I'm going to finish up. Please.
###3017 What is the average timeframe you're looking at in the...
###3019 This is typically a 12-year path. 12-year.
###3023 We're going to finish up real quick
###3024 and then I'll open up to questions.
###3026 Why is the Stanford tuition bill worth it?
###3028 You can pass this on to your parents.
###3030 I did an analysis of all the dealmakers in all these 12 hotspots.
###3034 And those four lines represent four universities.
###3037 I'm sorry, I used red, crimson for Harvard, I apologize for that.
###3042 I used green for Stanford, I apologize because you have a tree,
###3046 that's my thinking.
###3049 Blue is the University of Pennsylvania and grey is MIT.
###3054 And in each of these regions, the top universities that yellow bar
###3058 are usually the local universities.
###3060 In Boston, it's Harvard; the Bay Area, it's Stanford;
###3063 in Phoenix, it's Arizona State;
###3065 in Seattle, it's University of Washington;
###3067 Minneapolis, it's University of Minnesota;
###3068 in Denver, it's University of Colorado Boulder;
###3070 in Orange County, California and it's Harvard, sorry about that.
###3074 In San Diego, it's Harvard, you got to fix that,
###3076 you got something else. And in Portland, it's Stanford;
###3078 in Salt Lake City, it's Brigham Young;
###3081 in Raleigh, it's University of North Carolina
###3082 at Chapel Hill - go Tar Heels - and Austin,
###3085 it's University of Texas at Austin.
###3087 However, in every single one of these regions,
###3090 those four universities are present among the dealmaker community.
###3093 That's the old social network.
###3095 Do you think you can use that as an advantage in your future?
###3098 And let me tell you where Stanford shows up,
###3101 in Boston number four, behind Northeastern, which is a local school,
###3105 in the Bay Area number one, in Phoenix number three,
###3108 behind Harvard, sorry, in Seattle number three, behind Harvard again,
###3112 Minneapolis, it's number four behind Harvard again;
###3115 Denver, it's number two ahead of Harvard,
###3118 alright, Denver, Orange County right below Harvard,
###3122 San Diego right below Harvard, Portland number one,
###3126 above Harvard, Salt Lake City number four,
###3128 behind Harvard, Raleigh behind NC State University, sorry, guys.
###3133 You need to come up to see us a little bit.
###3135 In Austin number three, right below Harvard,
###3137 let me tell you, you're just below Harvard
###3139 as being the most prominent university.
###3142 And I'll tell you another thing that this
###3145 is skewed towards financial engineering.
###3147 So if we took an entrepreneurial slice at this,
###3149 Stanford is going to be number one.
###3152 So, you could tell your parents that you're making this happen.
###3156 We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give.
###3159 I think Winston Churchill said it right, right?
###3161 So, I'm going to leave the balance of the time open for questions.
###3164 How is that?
###3173 This is you by the way, this is the way I see you all, right?
###3178 So, what questions are out there? Please.
###3181 So, your analysis about dealmakers,
###3183 are you looking at just people who have equity stakes,
###3186 or are you doing some kind of score carding against people
###3191 who have investment stakes in successful entreneurships? Right.
###3198 So the question is when I do the dealmaker analysis,
###3200 am I just looking at equity positions or am I qualifying those
###3202 equity positions by determining the degree of success?
###3206 And the answer is it's the former.
###3208 And would it be better if I did the latter? Absolutely.
###3210 And I'm looking at those nuances as we speak.
###3216 Have you looked at clusters,
###3217 for example, the PayPal Mafia or the Association?
###3221 The syndication patterns,
###3223 this kind of group, there is no question that they exist and you
###3226 see that pattern continuously when you break down the model.
###3229 I think that that's the next thing. They actually operate as a band.
###3234 In many cases, those networks remain as they go
###3236 to the second deal or third deal or fourth deal.
###3238 When LinkedIn IPO'ed, everyone was following the folks who
###3241 were made into multimillionaires,
###3243 there is logic behind that because they actually
###3245 will bring things to life again.
###3247 
###3252 Could you extrapolate from your data sort of how do you create
###3256 those 10% in the first place in emerging clusters? Yeah.
###3259 So, the question is,
###3261 is there a way that we could actually extrapolate based
###3263 on what we're seeing in the data to show how we could create
###3266 greater performance in those networks and how do we make
###3269 clusters better or how do you induce new clusters?
###3271 I think that's a science - well,
###3272 it's the art I think that's now unfolding.
###3275 We're trying to figure that out as matter of fact.
###3277 The Kauffman Foundation, as a matter of fact,
###3279 in four weeks, we're going to pick a city,
###3282 guess where Kauffman Foundation is located? Kansas City, Missouri.
###3286 We've mapped all the dealmakers,
###3288 we're bringing them in for one meeting,
###3289 they're all going to meet each other and we're going to actually
###3292 start understanding the roles and try to figure out how we can
###3295 actually build Kansas City into an entrepreneurial hotspot.
###3298 That will be one hell of an experiment, don't you think? Yeah.
###3302 Questions?
###3304 You talked a lot about the importance of expanding your network.
###3308 I think for a lot of us there's a tension
###3310 between doing that and being creative,
###3312 which often happens alone and without distraction.
###3315 I'm curious what advice you give to folks who struggle with that.
###3318 No, I think even the creative process,
###3321 and the question was - as a creative or someone who is innovative,
###3324 sometimes that's something you do independently,
###3327 you do alone, you don't necessarily have
###3329 to do it in a network type of phenomena.
###3332 But I would argue that once you've created,
###3334 it's nice to get the insight from others
###3338 and make those insights available, adapt your thinking.
###3342 I fall in love with these open source models where
###3345 people are starting to crowdsource solutions,
###3348 but I honestly do think that people who create typically
###3351 create based on independent ingenuity.
###3353 So, I think you're absolutely right, that's a critical tension.
###3357 The real question was should you err in one direction or the other?
###3360 I tend to think that people on the West Coast
###3361 tend to network and not independently create,
###3364 but honestly, you should create space.
###3367 You know I find that ultimately being involved
###3369 in trying to answer my e-mails every day,
###3372 it takes every bit of creative energy out of me,
###3374 honestly, to the extent that I just want to say,
###3377 I'm e-mail bankrupt, and give it up.
###3380 I'd rather do what I do, which is I like to create.
###3384 So, I understand - feel your pain. I think that... Yep, yep, yep.
###3387 Please give a round of applause. Thank you very much.
