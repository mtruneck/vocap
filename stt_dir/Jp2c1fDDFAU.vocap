###11 ALEJANDRA GAITAN: So hi, everyone.
###12 I just saw this video of a dog--
###14 FEMALE SPEAKER 1: --at a vet's office--
###14 MEGAN LEE HEART: --giving the person behind
###17 the register a receipt.
###19 ALEJANDRA GAITAN: It's just really, really--
###20 MEGAN LEE HEART: --cute.
###21 FEMALE SPEAKER 2: So, anyways, yeah.
###25 TIM SAVAGE: There's a trend happening on YouTube right now
###27 which, basically, is just a bunch of fat-titty girls
###29 making stupid-ass reply videos to everything that comes out.
###33 MALE SPEAKER 1: They're flipping everywhere.
###34 Even on this video, because it's about reply girls, there
###37 will be about five down here to the left of me.
###40 You look down at the related videos, there will probably be
###41 some reply girls there.
###42 THE LUCHADOR: They do shitty videos.
###44 They're completely terrible.
###46 TIM SAVAGE: Just these girls yapping nonsense for long
###48 enough to fit an ad in so they can make money.
###51 THE LUCHADOR: People take hours, and hours, and hours to
###53 produce a quality video and original content.
###56 And they just pretty much watch it, reply, and they get
###60 100 times what I would get in views-- and like this.
###63 MALE SPEAKER 1: The end result is almost painful to watch.
###66 MALE SPEAKER 2: Oh, hey guys.
###67 MALE SPEAKER 3: Oh, it made me so hot.
###70 MALE SPEAKER 4: [SPEAKING GERMAN]
###71 
###74 ADOLF HITLER: [SPEAKING GERMAN]
###77 ALEJANDRA GAITAN: Peace and love, guys, see you.
###78 Thank you very much for watching, bye.
###80 
###88 Now, in case you don't me, I am the Reply Girl, probably
###93 one of YouTube's most hated personalities right now.
###98 [SPANISH]
###101 When I started YouTube-ing, I was below the poverty line,
###105 and I really, really, really needed a way to get out of
###110 that situation.
###111 Hi guys.
###112 My first month, I made enough to pay a cellphone bill.
###116 And I worked so much.
###117 Well, it's very simple.
###120 You go on YouTube and you look for the
###122 videos that are trending.
###124 I like those that are, like, random and funny.
###129 Good morning, Senor Luchador.
###131 I brought you breakfast with lots of lots of bacon.
###135 [SCREAM]
###138 THE LUCHADOR: Alejandra, well, to be honest, she is my
###140 girlfriend's sister.
###142 And [INAUDIBLE] she's my YouTube mentor.
###145 And we can offer that service.
###146 [INAUDIBLE] service of having a studio with a green screen,
###150 and having like interns.
###151 ALEJANDRA GAITAN: Well, the thing is that-- what you're
###153 putting at stake is your skills and your time.
###155 What I'm putting in stakes is my money.
###157 So if it doesn't work, OK, fine.
###159 You wasted your time.
###160 But me, my money's going to be gone, and I'll be screwed.
###164 THE LUCHADOR: Alejandra actually pretty much convinced
###168 me to start making videos on YouTube.
###170 ALEJANDRA GAITAN: Hey guys, I just saw--
###171 THE LUCHADOR: Reply Girl, Reply Girl.
###172 I need some advice.
###173 Haters are trying to get at me, and you know what?
###175 I've got to go break their necks one by one.
###178 [GRUNT]
###180 Well, what happened was that she showed me her check.
###183 And it was a nice check.
###185 For what she does, it was a very, very beautiful check.
###188 ALEJANDRA GAITAN: I always wanted to be an autonomous
###192 worker, or have a company, or make money on my
###198 own, be my own boss.
###201 And I just never knew what, exactly, I wanted to do to
###206 make it happen.
###207 I just knew I want it to happen.
###211 I studied programming.
###213 But it didn't work out very well because I'm not a very
###219 good programmer.
###221 And yeah, I also did some babysitting.
###224 But that's about it.
###227 THE LUCHADOR: I tried doing replies myself.
###229 And believe it or not, it's a harder job than
###232 you think it is.
###234 It's long.
###234 It's boring, tedious, it's annoying.
###238 I mean, it's not a fun job.
###239 And the haters, people out there who are hating on reply
###243 people, and, like, oh you know, what they do is
###245 brainless--
###246 you know what?
###246 Do it yourself.
###247 If you don't like it, don't do it and don't watch it.
###249 Simple as that.
###251 First times that these haters-- they're posting
###255 videos and threads about finding her address, her IP
###258 address, and knowing where she lives.
###259 I've seen posts on YouTube, people
###262 actually posting an address.
###264 They thought that they found her address, and they posted
###265 it everywhere.
###267 What kind of a bad person are you to take a hated person's
###272 address and post it to the public?
###274 So some crazy person comes over and sees the address and
###279 does something that they're going to regret
###281 later on, you know?
###281 Oh Jesus.
###283 If only they knew.
###285 I'm waiting.
###286 ALEJANDRA GAITAN: Like, I mean, I know you are going to
###288 interview Megan, but you shouldn't do it because she
###292 has tried to destroy me and to destroy everybody else that
###296 has done replies.
###299 MEGAN LEE HEART: Look, the Reply Girl, Alejandra--
###303 shut up.
###304 Drop it.
###304 It's getting out of hand.
###306 THE LUCHADOR: Megan understood that Alejandra and all the
###309 other reply people are competition.
###311 So the way to get them off YouTube is to threaten them,
###314 send death letters, try to hack them, try to find their
###316 address to go and send people to do things, which is
###320 completely unethical.
###323 ALEJANDRA GAITAN: They leave all sorts of comments, like,
###325 I'm going to rape you.
###326 We're going to go to your house and slit your throat.
###329 THE LUCHADOR: Vicious.
###330 When you talk about, feline, cat crazy--
###333 vicious, you've got that side.
###336 ALEJANDRA GAITAN: What's this expression--
###338 a dog that barks too much but that doesn't bite?
###341 TIM SAVAGE: Now a couple of weeks ago I had a video about
###343 the reply girls.
###344 And the craziest thing to me was they could not understand
###348 how someone could watch their videos and think that they
###350 were stupid and annoying.
###352 For those that are initiated with the character, and what
###355 I'm trying to do with satire of white trash America, and
###357 that kind of thing-- probably 1 out of every 10 comments
###360 that I get personally is, I'm going to fucking kill you.
###364 When I worked in radio, I had a couple of hate calls a week.
###368 But online, I get a couple of hate comments a second--
###372 every second.
###372 The anonymity of the internet gives people that feeling of
###376 power that they can do whatever they want.
###379 And they don't understand the responsibility.
###381 I understand, she's just somebody that's trying to make
###383 it, you know?
###384 Not even make it, but, like, make it by--
###386 And, of course, a little bit of attention.
###387 Who doesn't like attention.
###389 ALEJANDRA GAITAN: So this is a video of me modelling.
###393 Look, let's be honest here--
###396 that's just the way, sorry to say it, male brain in
###400 particular interprets certain images.
###404 One cannot deny it--
###406 sex appeal, it's a winner.
###412 I don't think it can open, actually.
###414 No it doesn't open.
###415 If I was earning good money, I would move out.
###418 But since I can't, I'd rather stay here in safety.
###423 I actually have lots of clothes.
###426 It's amazing.
###427 Due to the fact that I'm living in this house, I can
###431 only wear certain types of shirts, even if I do have a
###435 lot of clothing.
###437 Let's just say family conflicts.
###441 They're too sexy.
###442 
###449 ALEJANDRA GAITAN: I can see it bothers her a lot.
###452 She expected us to follow the traditional way and to, what
###458 can I say, get a job, work all of your life, and then, at the
###467 end of your life, when you are, like, useless, retire.
###472 Whose happiness is more important?
###474 I pick mine over hers.
###477 My father is back in Latin America because we were about
###481 to immigrate, and he kind of just hooked up
###485 with another girl.
###485 So--
###487 At the beginning, we used to talk like once a month.
###492 But as years passed by, I think it was, like, twice a
###496 year, and then it was once a year.
###499 And it's been like six to eight months since I don't
###502 talk to him, so--
###503 
###508 THE LUCHADOR: Her traffic went completely shut.
###510 It went down like crazy.
###511 The way that the YouTube algorithm is
###514 changing her business--
###517 also changing everyone's.
###519 ALEJANDRA GAITAN: One day, without warning, I saw this--
###521 poof.
###522 And I was, like, Jesus, Lord, mercy.
###525 What am I going to do now?
###529 I plan to keep on YouTube-ing.
###532 And in the future, I'm not really sure what I would do.
###540 Oy.
###542 Hello, Pollux.
###544 You know what's funny, people think that I'm this party
###548 animal, that I go out and have fun and enjoy and
###552 do this and do that.
###554 But no, in reality I'm a very lonely person.
###557 And I like to stay in my room.
###559 I almost never go out.
###562 And I'm just OK here, in my house.
###565 
###568 Kind of--
###569 I don't know.
###571 I wonder if it would have been better if he had just, if we
###575 would have just broke.
###577 But you never expect your boyfriend to die and to die in
###581 such a way.
###583 He was a kind man.
###585 He was a kind man, sir.
###588 He was a good boy.
###591 And well, I don't know if I'll look for somebody, or if I'll
###603 just stay alone, you know?
###605
