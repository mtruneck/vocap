1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,82



2
0:0:0,82 --> 0:0:2,48
MALE SPEAKER 1: Children
of all ages.


3
0:0:2,48 --> 0:0:7,782
Everything forgotten, except
the magic world they're in.


4
0:0:7,782 --> 0:0:10,69
Circus world.


5
0:0:10,69 --> 0:0:12,58
DERRICK ROSAIRE: We've got
18 bears to take care of.


6
0:0:12,58 --> 0:0:16,505
They've got 38 lions and
tigers, a petting zoo.


7
0:0:16,505 --> 0:0:20,9
There's just a lot of
stuff around here.


8
0:0:20,9 --> 0:0:22,82
KAY ROSAIRE: We've always been
saving animals all our lives.


9
0:0:22,82 --> 0:0:25,77
We rescued everything
that needed a home.


10
0:0:25,77 --> 0:0:26,79
We are pro-animal.


11
0:0:26,79 --> 0:0:28,87
We are animal welfare.


12
0:0:28,87 --> 0:0:31,43
But there's a big difference
between animal welfare and


13
0:0:31,43 --> 0:0:32,54
animal rights.


14
0:0:32,54 --> 0:0:34,7
MALE SPEAKER 2: Both elephants
were forced to perform almost


15
0:0:34,7 --> 0:0:36,22
until the day of their deaths.


16
0:0:36,22 --> 0:0:38,23
MALE SPEAKER 3: How can we
consider ourselves civilized


17
0:0:38,23 --> 0:0:40,98
while we continue to allow the
suffering and abuse of animals


18
0:0:40,98 --> 0:0:42,35
simply for entertainment?


19
0:0:42,35 --> 0:0:44,1
CLAYTON ROSAIRE: PETA, the
People for the Ethical


20
0:0:44,1 --> 0:0:45,86
Treatment of Animals, they think
the animals are better


21
0:0:45,86 --> 0:0:49,26
off dead than working for
us, happy, alive,


22
0:0:49,26 --> 0:0:50,87
in this nice area.


23
0:0:50,87 --> 0:0:52,45
It's messed up, huh?


24
0:0:52,45 --> 0:0:52,88
Uh-oh.


25
0:0:52,88 --> 0:0:56,26
There goes the mic.


26
0:0:56,26 --> 0:0:58,28
This is what I really love,
otherwise, I'd have done


27
0:0:58,28 --> 0:0:59,5
something else.


28
0:0:59,5 --> 0:1:2,71
It's not like my family's not
like, [WHIP SOUND], you will


29
0:1:2,71 --> 0:1:4,25
be a dog trainer.


30
0:1:4,25 --> 0:1:5,98
You get to choose what
you want to do.


31
0:1:5,98 --> 0:1:8,16
It's what you love.


32
0:1:8,16 --> 0:1:9,43
RYAN DUFFY: Did you just
get pissed on?


33
0:1:9,43 --> 0:1:11,414
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: This is
how they train them.


34
0:1:11,414 --> 0:1:13,9
This is wrong!


35
0:1:13,9 --> 0:1:16,34
MALE SPEAKER 4: This gives
the circuses across


36
0:1:16,34 --> 0:1:17,4
America a black eye.


37
0:1:17,4 --> 0:1:19,97
This is exactly what people
protest against.


38
0:1:19,97 --> 0:1:21,24
PAM ROSAIRE ZOPPE: There
basically is


39
0:1:21,24 --> 0:1:22,26
no more circus anymore.


40
0:1:22,26 --> 0:1:24,65
It's a dying art form.


41
0:1:24,65 --> 0:1:26,4
KAY ROSAIRE: I think people will
miss it when it's gone.


42
0:1:26,4 --> 0:1:28,978
If they don't pay attention,
it will be.


43
0:1:28,978 --> 0:1:43,46



44
0:1:43,46 --> 0:1:44,99
DERRICK ROSAIRE: Don't
even think about it.


45
0:1:44,99 --> 0:1:46,5
RYAN DUFFY: I don't know
if you guys do this.


46
0:1:46,5 --> 0:1:50,2
It's up to you, but if I were
you, my pick up line would be,


47
0:1:50,2 --> 0:1:52,46
hey, I train fucking bears.


48
0:1:52,46 --> 0:1:53,68
DERRICK ROSAIRE: I have
a little better pick


49
0:1:53,68 --> 0:1:54,99
up line than that.


50
0:1:54,99 --> 0:1:56,98
I point at my leg.


51
0:1:56,98 --> 0:2:0,74
RYAN DUFFY: Whoo, what the
hell happened there?


52
0:2:0,74 --> 0:2:2,41
DERRICK ROSAIRE: And that's what
happens when you screw up


53
0:2:2,41 --> 0:2:3,69
working around bears.


54
0:2:3,69 --> 0:2:5,61
RYAN DUFFY: Holy fuck, dude.


55
0:2:5,61 --> 0:2:7,0
CLAYTON ROSAIRE: Say hi.


56
0:2:7,0 --> 0:2:8,25
RYAN DUFFY: Hi buddy.


57
0:2:8,25 --> 0:2:11,339



58
0:2:11,339 --> 0:2:12,45
CLAYTON ROSAIRE: Oh, shit.


59
0:2:12,45 --> 0:2:13,12
RYAN DUFFY: Oh, dude.


60
0:2:13,12 --> 0:2:14,49
CLAYTON ROSAIRE: Sorry,
I had to.


61
0:2:14,49 --> 0:2:16,26
Did you hear the squeaking
noise again?


62
0:2:16,26 --> 0:2:19,9
That was his hiney.


63
0:2:19,9 --> 0:2:21,996
RYAN DUFFY: We're here in
Sarasota, Florida, with one of


64
0:2:21,996 --> 0:2:24,63
the last great American
circus families.


65
0:2:24,63 --> 0:2:26,4
CLAYTON ROSAIRE: We try to
rescue all the exotic animals


66
0:2:26,4 --> 0:2:29,21
that we can, and then I'm really
pushing in the future


67
0:2:29,21 --> 0:2:31,53
that we'll be able to rescue a
lot of exotic dancers. 'Cause


68
0:2:31,53 --> 0:2:31,89
they need a home--


69
0:2:31,89 --> 0:2:34,275
[LAUGHTER]


70
0:2:34,275 --> 0:2:37,33
KAY ROSAIRE: You're so bad.


71
0:2:37,33 --> 0:2:39,74
RYAN DUFFY: The Rosaires are a
10th generation circus family


72
0:2:39,74 --> 0:2:42,44
dating all the way back to
royal court jesters in


73
0:2:42,44 --> 0:2:44,47
medieval England.


74
0:2:44,47 --> 0:2:46,44
KAY ROSAIRE: Yeah, we have
a really long history.


75
0:2:46,44 --> 0:2:49,24
Here's my grandfather
and my grandmother.


76
0:2:49,24 --> 0:2:53,37
My father had a broken back when
he was a little boy, and


77
0:2:53,37 --> 0:2:55,8
so he had to quit doing
aerial things.


78
0:2:55,8 --> 0:2:58,5
He couldn't do anything
acrobatic anymore.


79
0:2:58,5 --> 0:3:1,41
And he always loved animals, so
he focused on animals his


80
0:3:1,41 --> 0:3:2,97
whole life.


81
0:3:2,97 --> 0:3:5,9
RYAN DUFFY: In 1960, Kay's
father, Derrick Rosaire, Sr.,


82
0:3:5,9 --> 0:3:8,45
immigrated to the United States
from South Wingfield,


83
0:3:8,45 --> 0:3:11,5
England, to appear on The Ed
Sullivan Show with his


84
0:3:11,5 --> 0:3:14,18
equestrian act, Rosaire and
Tony the Wonder Horse.


85
0:3:14,18 --> 0:3:16,22
He went on to perform on the
Tonight Show with Johnny


86
0:3:16,22 --> 0:3:19,29
Carson and at the White House
for President Nixon.


87
0:3:19,29 --> 0:3:21,62
KAY ROSAIRE: The culture in
America has a different view


88
0:3:21,62 --> 0:3:25,14
of circus because of P. T.
Barnum and his attitude about


89
0:3:25,14 --> 0:3:27,11
sort of shocking people.


90
0:3:27,11 --> 0:3:30,56
He changed the atmosphere of
the circus in this country.


91
0:3:30,56 --> 0:3:33,7
We're also in an era now where
people don't go out as


92
0:3:33,7 --> 0:3:33,93
much as they do.


93
0:3:33,93 --> 0:3:35,64
They're not used to live
entertainment.


94
0:3:35,64 --> 0:3:37,72
But the biggest impact
on the circus was the


95
0:3:37,72 --> 0:3:39,66
animal rights activists.


96
0:3:39,66 --> 0:3:41,99
MALE SPEAKER 3: Circuses cannot
provide animals with


97
0:3:41,99 --> 0:3:45,54
the facilities they need to
be healthy and happy.


98
0:3:45,54 --> 0:3:46,84
MALE SPEAKER 5: Many of
these animals will


99
0:3:46,84 --> 0:3:49,2
literally go insane.


100
0:3:49,2 --> 0:3:51,207
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Animal abuse
is billed as family


101
0:3:51,207 --> 0:3:52,161
entertainment.


102
0:3:52,161 --> 0:3:54,47
Although zoos claim to be
educational, they are still


103
0:3:54,47 --> 0:3:56,78
profit-making enterprises that
too often put their own


104
0:3:56,78 --> 0:3:59,61
commercial self-interest in
front of animal welfare.


105
0:3:59,61 --> 0:4:1,89
KAY ROSAIRE: All the animals
that I ever trained were all


106
0:4:1,89 --> 0:4:3,24
animals that needed a home.


107
0:4:3,24 --> 0:4:4,3
I always rescued.


108
0:4:4,3 --> 0:4:5,61
I never bought any animals.


109
0:4:5,61 --> 0:4:7,32
So I had always done that.


110
0:4:7,32 --> 0:4:9,94
And then after I had more than
I could handle, I just wanted


111
0:4:9,94 --> 0:4:11,25
to rescue more.


112
0:4:11,25 --> 0:4:13,35
So as my career blossomed,
and I had the


113
0:4:13,35 --> 0:4:15,55
money, I built the facility.


114
0:4:15,55 --> 0:4:17,69
RYAN DUFFY: The Big Cat Habitat
began rescuing animals


115
0:4:17,69 --> 0:4:20,88
in 1987 and has since grown
to feature three housing


116
0:4:20,88 --> 0:4:24,75
complexes, adjoining exercise
habitats, and pools, and it's


117
0:4:24,75 --> 0:4:28,36
currently home to tigers,
ligers, lions, bears, and


118
0:4:28,36 --> 0:4:32,52
basically, anything else with
fur, a shell, or wings.


119
0:4:32,52 --> 0:4:35,6
GIRL: Well, I came here to study
a little bit about the


120
0:4:35,6 --> 0:4:38,774
different animals, and I've
never really seen any kinds of


121
0:4:38,774 --> 0:4:40,3
animals like these before.


122
0:4:40,3 --> 0:4:41,23
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: We've
been here before.


123
0:4:41,23 --> 0:4:43,32
We love animals.


124
0:4:43,32 --> 0:4:46,16
This is a great place to bring
people to show them what


125
0:4:46,16 --> 0:4:49,6
they're doing with preserving
these animals and taking good


126
0:4:49,6 --> 0:4:51,1
care of them.


127
0:4:51,1 --> 0:4:53,14
KAY ROSAIRE: My brother started
being a softy for


128
0:4:53,14 --> 0:4:56,46
bears, and Pam with
the chimps.


129
0:4:56,46 --> 0:5:0,61
And so it just sort of naturally
evolved into this.


130
0:5:0,61 --> 0:5:2,55
Why you got to bug me, huh?


131
0:5:2,55 --> 0:5:5,42
RYAN DUFFY: Caring for these
animals is a 24/7 job.


132
0:5:5,42 --> 0:5:8,39
And for Pam, Kay's sister, they
might as well be family.


133
0:5:8,39 --> 0:5:11,26
PAM ROSAIRE ZOPPE: Well, I tried
everything, and I like


134
0:5:11,26 --> 0:5:12,79
chimps the best.


135
0:5:12,79 --> 0:5:15,15
I raised my daughter
with a chimp.


136
0:5:15,15 --> 0:5:19,9
When my daughter was born, one
of my chimps was pregnant, and


137
0:5:19,9 --> 0:5:20,32
I didn't even know it.


138
0:5:20,32 --> 0:5:23,97
And his mother died
when he was born.


139
0:5:23,97 --> 0:5:27,32
So I ended up breastfeeding
him.


140
0:5:27,32 --> 0:5:31,48
I don't know, I just felt so bad
for their plight because


141
0:5:31,48 --> 0:5:35,982
they've always been mishandled
and mistreated.


142
0:5:35,982 --> 0:5:37,43
So my heart went out to them.


143
0:5:37,43 --> 0:5:40,42
I started buying little baby
chimps that were heading for


144
0:5:40,42 --> 0:5:44,2
research when I was
a teenager.


145
0:5:44,2 --> 0:5:47,9
And Newton was probably the
best chimp I ever had.


146
0:5:47,9 --> 0:5:52,28
It was quite interesting to
raise him along with a child.


147
0:5:52,28 --> 0:5:54,73
Newton was an excellent cook.


148
0:5:54,73 --> 0:5:56,841
RYAN DUFFY: Cooks
meaning what?


149
0:5:56,841 --> 0:5:58,53
PAM ROSAIRE ZOPPE: Cook food.


150
0:5:58,53 --> 0:6:1,81
My plan was to do a cooking
program and call it Newton's


151
0:6:1,81 --> 0:6:6,88
Kitchen, but we filmed the
first one, and five days


152
0:6:6,88 --> 0:6:11,14
later, Newton had a
stroke and died.


153
0:6:11,14 --> 0:6:13,52
KAY ROSAIRE: Kayes Lions
is my uncle.


154
0:6:13,52 --> 0:6:15,24
That's why I'm named Kay.


155
0:6:15,24 --> 0:6:17,96
My uncle had been a famous lion
trainer in England during


156
0:6:17,96 --> 0:6:19,84
the '30s and '40s.


157
0:6:19,84 --> 0:6:23,76
And then when I was in high
school, I had the chance to


158
0:6:23,76 --> 0:6:26,37
work with Clarence, the
cross-eyed lion.


159
0:6:26,37 --> 0:6:29,66
And that's when I started
working with big cats, and I


160
0:6:29,66 --> 0:6:30,57
was hooked on them.


161
0:6:30,57 --> 0:6:33,28
That's what I decided
I wanted to do.


162
0:6:33,28 --> 0:6:36,44
And it was interesting, because
sometimes I'd have her


163
0:6:36,44 --> 0:6:39,3
mouth open, and I'd be putting
my head in her mouth in these


164
0:6:39,3 --> 0:6:41,61
big auditoriums with the super
troupers, and I could see the


165
0:6:41,61 --> 0:6:44,9
spotlight shining in
through her nose.


166
0:6:44,9 --> 0:6:46,87
It gave me chills when I
realized how lucky I was and


167
0:6:46,87 --> 0:6:48,69
never got hurt.


168
0:6:48,69 --> 0:6:51,68
13,000 times.


169
0:6:51,68 --> 0:6:58,35
Well, because I did an average
of about 500 shows a year.


170
0:6:58,35 --> 0:7:0,65
RYAN DUFFY: Anyone who questions
circus people and


171
0:7:0,65 --> 0:7:3,47
their care for animals, and the
conditions, should have to


172
0:7:3,47 --> 0:7:7,135
come here at 8:00 AM and clean
up tiger shit with these guys.


173
0:7:7,135 --> 0:7:10,16
Because there's no way you'd
do that if you don't truly


174
0:7:10,16 --> 0:7:11,65
love animals.


175
0:7:11,65 --> 0:7:13,84
CLAYTON ROSAIRE: You get up, you
clean everybody out, make


176
0:7:13,84 --> 0:7:15,22
sure everybody's got
fresh water.


177
0:7:15,22 --> 0:7:16,83
Here at the habitat,
they all rotate.


178
0:7:16,83 --> 0:7:19,5
They all have these big outdoor
habitats that they get


179
0:7:19,5 --> 0:7:20,52
to run and play and
everything.


180
0:7:20,52 --> 0:7:21,7
It's a full day.


181
0:7:21,7 --> 0:7:24,79
You really have to spend most
of the day with the animals.


182
0:7:24,79 --> 0:7:27,0
RYAN DUFFY: It's just
a different smell.


183
0:7:27,0 --> 0:7:28,5
It's not even like shit.


184
0:7:28,5 --> 0:7:31,22
It's pure dead animal.


185
0:7:31,22 --> 0:7:32,804
CLAYTON ROSAIRE: You know what
I'm saying, one little


186
0:7:32,804 --> 0:7:34,85
slip-up, and you could be
that turd down there.


187
0:7:34,85 --> 0:7:37,9
RYAN DUFFY: Oh, that
is terrible.


188
0:7:37,9 --> 0:7:38,39
CLAYTON ROSAIRE: It's
rewarding, isn't it?


189
0:7:38,39 --> 0:7:43,88



190
0:7:43,88 --> 0:7:45,92
CLAYTON ROSAIRE: You know, way
back in the old days, a lot of


191
0:7:45,92 --> 0:7:48,15
the videos they showed when
they're trying to make it look


192
0:7:48,15 --> 0:7:50,84
bad, a lot of those animals
were from the wild.


193
0:7:50,84 --> 0:7:53,66
They got them from wild animal
parks, and they'd just go in


194
0:7:53,66 --> 0:7:56,1
and grab a couple and throw them
in a truck and sell them.


195
0:7:56,1 --> 0:7:58,995
Times were different, so
those type of acts


196
0:7:58,995 --> 0:7:59,92
were totally different.


197
0:7:59,92 --> 0:8:2,53
You never saw in the old days
a tiger trainer petting a


198
0:8:2,53 --> 0:8:4,78
tiger, because it was a
different relationship.


199
0:8:4,78 --> 0:8:6,71
Well, times change.


200
0:8:6,71 --> 0:8:9,17
You have to learn to work with
the animals and be a part of


201
0:8:9,17 --> 0:8:12,26
their family and have them
be a part of your family.


202
0:8:12,26 --> 0:8:13,11
You don't have to be
cruel to them.


203
0:8:13,11 --> 0:8:14,64
You don't have to abuse them.


204
0:8:14,64 --> 0:8:17,83
They can be great kids,
and they can love you.


205
0:8:17,83 --> 0:8:20,57
There's always been a connection
between man and


206
0:8:20,57 --> 0:8:21,62
beast, and we just show
them how it can be


207
0:8:21,62 --> 0:8:23,22
done the right way.


208
0:8:23,22 --> 0:8:26,0
KAY ROSAIRE: Our mission has
become really important over


209
0:8:26,0 --> 0:8:29,4
the last 20 years, because the
environmental issues that are


210
0:8:29,4 --> 0:8:32,15
going on with animals
disappearing and all of that,


211
0:8:32,15 --> 0:8:35,679
we are able to let people see
them up close and personal.


212
0:8:35,679 --> 0:8:37,34
And it makes them much
more willing to


213
0:8:37,34 --> 0:8:39,15
help them in the wilds.


214
0:8:39,15 --> 0:8:40,7
We just lost my brother.


215
0:8:40,7 --> 0:8:45,36
This is my brother, Derrick,
with the bear, Peter.


216
0:8:45,36 --> 0:8:46,39
RYAN DUFFY: That's
a great picture.


217
0:8:46,39 --> 0:8:49,0
Derrick Rosaire, Jr.
died in 2010.


218
0:8:49,0 --> 0:8:51,72
And since then, his sons have
taken over his place as


219
0:8:51,72 --> 0:8:53,55
caretakers of the bears.


220
0:8:53,55 --> 0:8:57,8
FREDERICK ROSAIRE:
Aspa, wave, wave.


221
0:8:57,8 --> 0:8:57,5
Higher.


222
0:8:57,5 --> 0:8:58,75
Give me a good wave.


223
0:8:58,75 --> 0:9:2,34



224
0:9:2,34 --> 0:9:4,1
DERRICK ROSAIRE: Well, the big
male we have down at that end


225
0:9:4,1 --> 0:9:5,58
weighs 1,500 pounds.


226
0:9:5,58 --> 0:9:7,21
He stands 11 foot tall.


227
0:9:7,21 --> 0:9:9,46
That's an average male Kodiak.


228
0:9:9,46 --> 0:9:11,28
FREDERICK ROSAIRE: But
everything you do with them,


229
0:9:11,28 --> 0:9:13,13
you have to do nicely.


230
0:9:13,13 --> 0:9:16,13
You have to be very gentle about
it, because if you try


231
0:9:16,13 --> 0:9:19,9
to force them, they eat you.


232
0:9:19,9 --> 0:9:22,7
DERRICK ROSAIRE: If it wasn't
for circus, five species of


233
0:9:22,7 --> 0:9:24,988
bears would be extinct.


234
0:9:24,988 --> 0:9:27,8
Yeah, it's what we've
all our lives, it's


235
0:9:27,8 --> 0:9:28,95
what we're good at.


236
0:9:28,95 --> 0:9:30,89
And lay down.


237
0:9:30,89 --> 0:9:37,21



238
0:9:37,21 --> 0:9:39,43
KAY ROSAIRE: You know, it's
amazing, because had our


239
0:9:39,43 --> 0:9:42,71
circus friend not sent it to
me, we never would have had


240
0:9:42,71 --> 0:9:43,53
any of this stuff.


241
0:9:43,53 --> 0:9:46,9
Because by the time the
newspaper articles came out,


242
0:9:46,9 --> 0:9:49,2
my parents were already
in the next city.


243
0:9:49,2 --> 0:9:51,56
It's neat to have
all this stuff.


244
0:9:51,56 --> 0:9:54,8
ELLEN ROSAIRE: Well, my dad was
a fabulous horse trainer,


245
0:9:54,8 --> 0:9:55,64
because he didn't really--


246
0:9:55,64 --> 0:9:56,86
he called it teaching.


247
0:9:56,86 --> 0:9:58,88
He would teach them,
and that's how


248
0:9:58,88 --> 0:10:0,51
we've always trained.


249
0:10:0,51 --> 0:10:2,21
Just the lips.


250
0:10:2,21 --> 0:10:5,23
OK, wide, good boy.


251
0:10:5,23 --> 0:10:7,76
We all work with all different
kinds of animals.


252
0:10:7,76 --> 0:10:11,8
I went with horses, because
I love to ride.


253
0:10:11,8 --> 0:10:13,94
I have a need for speed.


254
0:10:13,94 --> 0:10:16,75
I've been riding for more
than a half a century.


255
0:10:16,75 --> 0:10:18,8
And I still will get
on a horse and


256
0:10:18,8 --> 0:10:20,28
just go ripping away.


257
0:10:20,28 --> 0:10:21,61
I love it.


258
0:10:21,61 --> 0:10:26,14
We love what we do, and
obviously they love us.


259
0:10:26,14 --> 0:10:28,21
Give me a hug.


260
0:10:28,21 --> 0:10:30,36
Good.


261
0:10:30,36 --> 0:10:33,53
I think there's a decline
in live family


262
0:10:33,53 --> 0:10:35,52
entertainment of all kinds.


263
0:10:35,52 --> 0:10:38,95
There's so much going
on in the world now.


264
0:10:38,95 --> 0:10:41,99
There's so many other forms of
entertainment happening.


265
0:10:41,99 --> 0:10:43,78
There's a lot to choose from.


266
0:10:43,78 --> 0:10:46,84
And people don't always take
the time to enjoy a live


267
0:10:46,84 --> 0:10:47,76
performance.


268
0:10:47,76 --> 0:10:50,5
For some reason, it's way
easier to just say,


269
0:10:50,5 --> 0:10:51,792
oh put the TV on.


270
0:10:51,792 --> 0:10:53,916
PAM ROSAIRE ZOPPE: See the
old-fashioned clothes?


271
0:10:53,916 --> 0:10:56,88
So it was quite a thing when
the circus came to town.


272
0:10:56,88 --> 0:10:58,37
They would parade into town.


273
0:10:58,37 --> 0:11:0,24
They'd all line up and
all come in together.


274
0:11:0,24 --> 0:11:3,43
And during the Depression, there
were over 44 circuses in


275
0:11:3,43 --> 0:11:5,84
this country, and they
did very, very well.


276
0:11:5,84 --> 0:11:11,27
People were seeking affordable
entertainment.


277
0:11:11,27 --> 0:11:13,655
When you went to the Ringling
show, and you saw Gunther


278
0:11:13,655 --> 0:11:17,67
Gebel-Williams, it warmed
your heart.


279
0:11:17,67 --> 0:11:19,274
There's none of that now.


280
0:11:19,274 --> 0:11:22,21
You know, there's something to
be said for the old school.


281
0:11:22,21 --> 0:11:23,945
CLAYTON ROSAIRE: --at the
beginning of his training.


282
0:11:23,945 --> 0:11:26,35
Everybody please say
hello to Handsome!


283
0:11:26,35 --> 0:11:28,274
Come on, Handsome, let's
go, big guy!


284
0:11:28,274 --> 0:11:30,2
Handsome--


285
0:11:30,2 --> 0:11:32,11
PAM ROSAIRE ZOPPE: I think
there'll always be circus, and


286
0:11:32,11 --> 0:11:34,9
to which level, or how
many, I don't know.


287
0:11:34,9 --> 0:11:36,4
But I'm sure it'll be around.


288
0:11:36,4 --> 0:11:39,81
It's been in this country for
over 220 years, I believe, so


289
0:11:39,81 --> 0:11:42,88
why would it stop?


290
0:11:42,88 --> 0:11:45,23
CLAYTON ROSAIRE: Circus is
supposed to be a place where


291
0:11:45,23 --> 0:11:48,73
you can take your entire family,
mom, dad, the kids,


292
0:11:48,73 --> 0:11:53,17
everybody, and make
them all happy.


293
0:11:53,17 --> 0:11:55,475
That's what circus
is all about.


294
0:11:55,475 --> 0:11:58,78
In one form or another, it
will still be around.


295
0:11:58,78 --> 0:12:0,52
FREDERICK ROSAIRE: As long as
people need entertainment,


296
0:12:0,52 --> 0:12:1,83
it'll be there.


297
0:12:1,83 --> 0:12:2,58
DERRICK ROSAIRE: The
show must go on.


298
0:12:2,58 --> 0:12:3,87
That's one of our sayings.


299
0:12:3,87 --> 0:12:5,84
It's a shitty saying,
but it works.


300
0:12:5,84 --> 0:12:9,2



301
0:12:9,2 --> 0:12:13,52
[APPLAUSE]


302
0:12:13,52 --> 0:12:15,54
KAY ROSAIRE: Everytime you
hear something, oh, the


303
0:12:15,54 --> 0:12:19,15
courtroom erupted into a
three-ring circus, you know,


304
0:12:19,15 --> 0:12:22,26
it's such a misnomer because
there's nothing more organized


305
0:12:22,26 --> 0:12:24,12
than a three-ring circus.


306
0:12:24,12 --> 0:12:27,83
CLAYTON ROSAIRE: When you're
ready, of course.


307
0:12:27,83 --> 0:12:29,89
And they need all that stuff.


308
0:12:29,89 --> 0:12:35,279



309
0:12:35,279 --> 0:12:39,16
Just so you know, Mr. Cameraman,
it's good luck to


310
0:12:39,16 --> 0:12:42,33
get peed on by a tiger.


311
0:12:42,33 --> 0:12:44,6
RYAN DUFFY: Did you just
get pissed on?


312
0:12:44,6 --> 0:12:45,26
I like that.


313
0:12:45,26 --> 0:12:47,27
CLAYTON ROSAIRE: You actually,
physically, now--


314
0:12:47,27 --> 0:12:51,47
I don't know if you know this or
not, but you belong to her.


315
0:12:51,47 --> 0:12:54,45
If she had a motorcycle right
now, you would be riding on


316
0:12:54,45 --> 0:12:55,83
the back of that motorcycle.


317
0:12:55,83 --> 0:14:55,83
