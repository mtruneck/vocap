1
0:0:6,7 --> 0:0:8,967
Let's start off with a toughie.
Who can tell me...?


2
0:0:8,967 --> 0:0:11,807
<i>The last few weeks</i>
<i>an amazing thing has happened,</i>


3
0:0:11,807 --> 0:0:15,847
<i>I've been nailing rounds, I'm starting</i>
<i>to separate myself from the pack,</i>


4
0:0:15,847 --> 0:0:19,687
Sir, the answer is Beck's triad.


5
0:0:19,687 --> 0:0:21,767
<i>It keeps me on top of my game,</i>


6
0:0:21,767 --> 0:0:24,447
Looks like a break in the ulna,
right there.


7
0:0:24,447 --> 0:0:26,567
<i>It's good to be the king,</i>


8
0:0:26,567 --> 0:0:31,367
You know, it's OK to be impressed by me.
Most girls are.


9
0:0:31,367 --> 0:0:34,407
<i>The problem with reaching the top</i>
<i>is sooner or later</i>


10
0:0:34,407 --> 0:0:36,767
<i>someone starts nipping at your heels,</i>


11
0:0:36,767 --> 0:0:43,727
<i>For me that guy was Nick Murdoch,</i>


12
0:0:43,727 --> 0:1:4,447
Well, the gurney adds drama.


13
0:1:4,447 --> 0:1:7,127
<i>So that's the guy</i>
<i>who wants to take me down,</i>


14
0:1:7,127 --> 0:1:9,167
Of course, you'll have a scar, Peter.


15
0:1:9,167 --> 0:1:15,487
You're not getting surgery but chicks
dig scars so l'm gonna give you one.


16
0:1:15,487 --> 0:1:19,7
Doctor, Peter's drug rash
is getting a lot worse.


17
0:1:19,7 --> 0:1:21,207
No problem, give him Prednisone...


18
0:1:21,207 --> 0:1:24,127
<i>Good bedside manner</i>
<i>good rapport with the nurses</i>


19
0:1:24,127 --> 0:1:26,767
<i>sees me staring at him,,,</i>


20
0:1:26,767 --> 0:1:28,807
<i>Act busy,</i>


21
0:1:28,807 --> 0:1:32,287
That's the stud right there.
That's where you'd...


22
0:1:32,287 --> 0:1:33,927
...hang a painting.


23
0:1:33,927 --> 0:1:37,847
He was born John Dorian
but he was simply known as JD:


24
0:1:37,847 --> 0:1:42,7
doctor, friend, lover.


25
0:1:42,7 --> 0:1:44,167
- Hey, man, how are ya?
- Hey, how are you?


26
0:1:44,167 --> 0:1:46,287
OK... There that is.


27
0:1:46,287 --> 0:1:48,487
Gosh, can you believe we're doctors?


28
0:1:48,487 --> 0:1:52,367
The other night at a restaurant
this guy starts choking.


29
0:1:52,367 --> 0:1:55,687
They asked if anyone was a doctor.
l didn't even move.


30
0:1:55,687 --> 0:1:59,967
l still feel like l'm seven years old
playing MASH with my older brother.


31
0:1:59,967 --> 0:2:2,447
l don't want
to be Hot Lips again.


32
0:2:2,447 --> 0:2:6,727
Shut up and kiss Frank.


33
0:2:6,727 --> 0:2:9,247
l don't talk to my brother much.


34
0:2:9,247 --> 0:2:11,607
<i>What you doing?</i>
<i>Don't connect with him,</i>


35
0:2:11,607 --> 0:2:14,7
- Well, l'll see you.
- OK.


36
0:2:14,7 --> 0:2:16,127
What happened to that guy?


37
0:2:16,127 --> 0:2:18,927
Eventually l remembered l was a doctor.


38
0:2:18,927 --> 0:2:21,887
He'd been dead for 20 minutes.
Very embarrassing.


39
0:2:21,887 --> 0:2:23,887
Food was good, though.


40
0:2:23,887 --> 0:2:27,607
<i>Don't laugh, Don't laugh!</i>


41
0:2:27,607 --> 0:2:30,7
<i>Damn!</i>


42
0:2:30,7 --> 0:2:35,167
Any time you wanna get more gauze,
it'd be a real treat for all of us.


43
0:2:35,167 --> 0:2:38,687
- lt's hard being you, isn't it?
- lt is.


44
0:2:38,687 --> 0:2:41,727
- What's with the smile?
- This whole big bad wolf thing,


45
0:2:41,727 --> 0:2:44,727
it's such an act.


46
0:2:44,727 --> 0:2:47,87
Neato!
Now whaddya want? A tip?


47
0:2:47,87 --> 0:2:50,127
Get out. Go, go!


48
0:2:50,127 --> 0:3:1,167
l'm not sure l agree.


49
0:3:1,167 --> 0:3:3,87
- You good T-dog?
- Come on, man.


50
0:3:3,87 --> 0:3:6,87
l could do this with my eyes closed.


51
0:3:6,87 --> 0:3:9,327
- l won't, though.
- Open the peritoneum.


52
0:3:9,327 --> 0:3:13,87
Nice, clean cut. Good.


53
0:3:13,87 --> 0:3:16,327
Good. Whoa, what's that smell?


54
0:3:16,327 --> 0:3:18,207
l don't know.


55
0:3:18,207 --> 0:3:20,247
- Did you nick the colon?
- No.


56
0:3:20,247 --> 0:3:22,967
l mean, l don't know.
l... l don't think so. Did l?


57
0:3:22,967 --> 0:3:24,807
Cut the music.


58
0:3:24,807 --> 0:3:27,687
You know, l kinda
had a date last night.


59
0:3:27,687 --> 0:3:29,167
- Really?
- Yeah.


60
0:3:29,167 --> 0:3:32,847
A guy on the bus fell asleep on me
and drooled on my shoulder.


61
0:3:32,847 --> 0:3:35,407
- You slut.
- Yeah.


62
0:3:35,407 --> 0:3:39,487
- How about Nick?
- l'd let him drool on me.


63
0:3:39,487 --> 0:3:42,767
That's gross. Why did l say that?
l shouldn't talk to people.


64
0:3:42,767 --> 0:3:45,967
l wouldn't know what to do
even if l was interested.


65
0:3:45,967 --> 0:3:50,487
Well, you could start by looking at him.


66
0:3:50,487 --> 0:3:52,727
Did he look back?
Why doesn't he like me?


67
0:3:52,727 --> 0:3:54,607
l can't believe l already blew it.


68
0:3:54,607 --> 0:3:58,687
<i>It felt weird trying to push Nick on</i>
<i>her, This morning I wanted to kill him,</i>


69
0:3:58,687 --> 0:4:1,527
<i>He's so nice</i>
<i>he probably would've helped me,</i>


70
0:4:1,527 --> 0:4:6,7
Come on, JD, you're not closing the
windpipe. Put more pressure down here.


71
0:4:6,7 --> 0:4:10,327
Come on! l know you can do it!
Come on! Come on!


72
0:4:10,327 --> 0:4:13,567
lf it isn't the brain trust.


73
0:4:13,567 --> 0:4:16,927
Someone tell me
what this patient's rash is.


74
0:4:16,927 --> 0:4:19,607
You have until l finish
my squeezy juice.


75
0:4:19,607 --> 0:4:21,407
<i>My God I'm drawing a,,,</i>


76
0:4:21,407 --> 0:4:24,527
<i>I can't remember what you draw</i>
<i>when your mind draws a,,,</i>


77
0:4:24,527 --> 0:4:25,647
<i>,,,something,</i>


78
0:4:25,647 --> 0:4:29,167
- lt's Erythema Migrans.
- Why don't you answer it?


79
0:4:29,167 --> 0:4:33,287
Everyone looks up to you. lt's
important you don't get stumped.


80
0:4:33,287 --> 0:4:35,487
Besides, it's important to you, too.


81
0:4:35,487 --> 0:4:38,447
<i>Please like he knows me,</i>


82
0:4:38,447 --> 0:4:41,487
lt's Erythema Migrans, sir.


83
0:4:41,487 --> 0:4:43,687
Right you are, Dr Dorian.


84
0:4:43,687 --> 0:4:46,287
Nice.


85
0:4:46,287 --> 0:4:48,287
OK, there you go.


86
0:4:48,287 --> 0:4:51,87
Now you've got it. Oh, good.


87
0:4:51,87 --> 0:4:54,87
l don't know
where that smell came from.


88
0:4:54,87 --> 0:4:57,127
- Er, sir?
- What? Do you see something?


89
0:4:57,127 --> 0:5:1,367
Sir, l farted.
That smell is from the fart l made.


90
0:5:1,367 --> 0:5:5,487
- Dude...
- Get the hell out of my OR.


91
0:5:5,487 --> 0:5:8,687
Yes, sir. Good.


92
0:5:8,687 --> 0:5:12,207
<i>Time to put myself</i>
<i>right back on top of Nick,</i>


93
0:5:12,207 --> 0:5:13,687
<i>That came out wrong,</i>


94
0:5:13,687 --> 0:5:17,87
Excuse me, Dr Cox?
l know that you need to pick an intern


95
0:5:17,87 --> 0:5:19,687
to co-write that case report
on post-partum...


96
0:5:19,687 --> 0:5:22,7
Yeah, sure. Congratulations. Now, go.


97
0:5:22,7 --> 0:5:23,847
<i>Mission accomplished,</i>


98
0:5:23,847 --> 0:5:26,87
Hey, buddy. How are ya?


99
0:5:26,87 --> 0:5:31,167
Dr Cox, l was wondering if l could
co-write that case report with you.


100
0:5:31,167 --> 0:5:36,7
Newbie Ã  Newbie. Too bad it can't be
a fight to the death.


101
0:5:36,7 --> 0:5:39,887
l didn't know you wanted to do it.
You do it.


102
0:5:39,887 --> 0:5:42,47
Nice guys aren't even that nice.


103
0:5:42,47 --> 0:5:59,47
Now let me see, just exactly
who to choose? Who to choose?


104
0:5:59,47 --> 0:6:5,887
Nice. Very nice, indeed.
OK, over.


105
0:6:5,887 --> 0:6:9,367
lnteresting.


106
0:6:9,367 --> 0:6:12,127
Attaboy.


107
0:6:12,127 --> 0:6:18,647
l'm gonna go with...
Guy Smiley, here.


108
0:6:18,647 --> 0:6:21,7
- Huge moment for me.
- l know.


109
0:6:21,7 --> 0:6:24,967
l wish my dad was alive.


110
0:6:24,967 --> 0:6:26,807
<i>It doesn't mean anything,</i>


111
0:6:26,807 --> 0:6:28,927
You flipped a coin in your head?


112
0:6:28,927 --> 0:6:37,727
No. lt's just that, right now, he's
better at internal medicine than you.


113
0:6:37,727 --> 0:6:40,247
OK, insult me, like you always do.


114
0:6:40,247 --> 0:6:45,847
Too easy.
When you least expect it.


115
0:6:45,847 --> 0:6:48,687
Dr Wen threatened
to sew my butt cheeks together.


116
0:6:48,687 --> 0:6:54,527
- Yet you continue to eat chilli.
- Dude, l'm taking the cheese off.


117
0:6:54,527 --> 0:6:59,167
Even though nothing happened today,
it still kinda freaked me out.


118
0:6:59,167 --> 0:7:3,7
One hiccup and that's the difference
between life and death?


119
0:7:3,7 --> 0:7:9,167
lt's a lot to have
on your shoulders, you know?


120
0:7:9,167 --> 0:7:11,607
What are you guys talking about?


121
0:7:11,607 --> 0:7:13,47
Cheese.


122
0:7:13,47 --> 0:7:16,927
Turk is so lucky
l met him first.


123
0:7:16,927 --> 0:7:19,207
How's my man doing?


124
0:7:19,207 --> 0:7:21,487
Baby, most guys are here.


125
0:7:21,487 --> 0:7:24,807
But me, l'm, like,
all up in here.


126
0:7:24,807 --> 0:7:30,7
Dr Turk, you can
make the incision now.


127
0:7:30,7 --> 0:7:32,847
Sir, my hand's tightening up.


128
0:7:32,847 --> 0:7:41,407
- l must be low on potassium.
- All right, l'll take over.


129
0:7:41,407 --> 0:7:45,927
Dr Murdoch, Peter's rash has gone but
he's vomited six times in the last hour.


130
0:7:45,927 --> 0:7:49,807
No problem, give him Zofran and
a 20cc per kilo bolus of normal saline.


131
0:7:49,807 --> 0:7:53,607
<i>Everyone's finally coming around</i>
<i>to my way of thinking about Nick,</i>


132
0:7:53,607 --> 0:7:56,527
You're right, he definitely
has a cute little butt.


133
0:7:56,527 --> 0:7:59,407
lt's almost like
it's been sculpted.


134
0:7:59,407 --> 0:8:2,847
Who cares? Everybody's got
a cute butt. l have a cute butt.


135
0:8:2,847 --> 0:8:7,287
You should bring it in some day.


136
0:8:7,287 --> 0:8:10,7
- How's Turk doing?
- He's fine, why?


137
0:8:10,7 --> 0:8:17,7
He totally froze during surgery
yesterday. Didn't he tell you?


138
0:8:17,7 --> 0:8:21,647
l feel like we haven't talked in ages.
How are you?


139
0:8:21,647 --> 0:8:23,47
- Fine.
- Yeah?


140
0:8:23,47 --> 0:8:31,87
Don't l look OK?
You know?


141
0:8:31,87 --> 0:8:33,927
You know? l'm fine.
As a matter of fact...


142
0:8:33,927 --> 0:8:39,687
<i>I am doin' OK I am doin' OK</i>


143
0:8:39,687 --> 0:8:42,207
Good afternoon, doctors.


144
0:8:42,207 --> 0:8:45,607
l've gathered you all here
because, well...


145
0:8:45,607 --> 0:8:50,167
Attendance at my noon conferences
has been very disappointing.


146
0:8:50,167 --> 0:8:55,727
l've begun to wonder if maybe
you have something more important to do.


147
0:8:55,727 --> 0:9:0,807
Maybe you feel the need to sneak off
and have a little nappy-nap?


148
0:9:0,807 --> 0:9:3,607
l love nappy-naps.


149
0:9:3,607 --> 0:9:9,7
Or maybe you've forgotten that
my conferences are mandatory.


150
0:9:9,7 --> 0:9:11,407
My hospital, my rules!


151
0:9:11,407 --> 0:9:16,247
l've never missed one.
Batting 1 ,000 over here.


152
0:9:16,247 --> 0:9:20,87
l'm more proud of you than
l've ever been of an intern.


153
0:9:20,87 --> 0:9:23,367
<i>How do you like me now Nick?</i>


154
0:9:23,367 --> 0:9:27,487
So you see, sir, the poor attendance
is my fault. And my fault only.


155
0:9:27,487 --> 0:9:30,527
Well, then,
you have just won the privilege


156
0:9:30,527 --> 0:9:38,367
of writing my next ten lectures
by this afternoon.


157
0:9:38,367 --> 0:9:40,527
Paging Dr Martyr...


158
0:9:40,527 --> 0:9:43,367
- What the hell was that guy...
- Way to go, man.


159
0:9:43,367 --> 0:9:47,407
Nick, that was amazing.


160
0:9:47,407 --> 0:9:52,927
<i>,,,thinking?</i>


161
0:9:52,927 --> 0:9:59,927
<i>It's good to be the king,</i>


162
0:9:59,927 --> 0:10:5,767
<i>Things change when</i>
<i>you're not the star any more,</i>


163
0:10:5,767 --> 0:10:10,527
What can l say? The lectures
this kid wrote were fantastic.


164
0:10:10,527 --> 0:10:16,967
<i>The hospital starts to seem</i>
<i>like a whole different place,</i>


165
0:10:16,967 --> 0:10:20,807
Hey, man. Want some company?


166
0:10:20,807 --> 0:10:27,207
No, l just wanna be alone.


167
0:10:27,207 --> 0:10:31,807
- Well?
- Not yet. But soon.


168
0:10:31,807 --> 0:10:36,287
Very soon.


169
0:10:36,287 --> 0:10:39,327
Why would Turk talk to Elliot about this
and not me?


170
0:10:39,327 --> 0:10:41,487
They're not friends,
know what l mean?


171
0:10:41,487 --> 0:10:44,807
After 25 minutes, the only way
l could know what you mean more


172
0:10:44,807 --> 0:10:48,367
is if you wrote ''My boyfriend doesn't
open up to me'' on a mallet


173
0:10:48,367 --> 0:10:50,807
and smashed me
over the head with it.


174
0:10:50,807 --> 0:10:53,567
Why can't you just for once
dig down in your heart,


175
0:10:53,567 --> 0:10:58,527
access some emotions
and empathise with me?


176
0:10:58,527 --> 0:11:1,927
- l'm sorry, what were we doing?
- That's why no one likes you.


177
0:11:1,927 --> 0:11:4,847
You like me a little bit.


178
0:11:4,847 --> 0:11:9,567
And so do you, sweet cakes.


179
0:11:9,567 --> 0:11:13,927
Want a little sugar from Daddy?


180
0:11:13,927 --> 0:11:18,727
Well, looky here.
l thought this was my special place.


181
0:11:18,727 --> 0:11:21,887
l'd ask you not to tell
the others about this spot,


182
0:11:21,887 --> 0:11:24,167
but none of them are talking to you.


183
0:11:24,167 --> 0:11:27,207
lt's been a rough day, sir.


184
0:11:27,207 --> 0:11:31,647
You see, Dr Dorian, your problem is,
you're a pansy.


185
0:11:31,647 --> 0:11:36,967
lf you were in my way,
l'd throw you off this ledge right now.


186
0:11:36,967 --> 0:11:40,207
We're out here alone.


187
0:11:40,207 --> 0:11:51,207
No one would ever know.


188
0:11:51,207 --> 0:11:54,167
l'm gonna...
l'm gonna... l have to...


189
0:11:54,167 --> 0:11:59,687
...things.


190
0:11:59,687 --> 0:12:4,887
lnterns are fun.


191
0:12:4,887 --> 0:12:6,887
l'm single.


192
0:12:6,887 --> 0:12:10,127
That was more subtle in my head.


193
0:12:10,127 --> 0:12:14,607
Relax, l already left a message
on your machine asking you out.


194
0:12:14,607 --> 0:12:16,927
- Really?
- No.


195
0:12:16,927 --> 0:12:20,647
- But l will before you go home.
- Works for me.


196
0:12:20,647 --> 0:12:25,47
Dr Murdoch, Peter's developed
a high-grade fever and a cough.


197
0:12:25,47 --> 0:12:27,487
No problem. Give him
Ceftazidime one gram lV.


198
0:12:27,487 --> 0:12:31,407
- How do you stay positive?
- l don't let the bad stuff in.


199
0:12:31,407 --> 0:12:34,327
Try not to get too overwhelmed.


200
0:12:34,327 --> 0:12:41,87
Call me tonight
when you get my message.


201
0:12:41,87 --> 0:12:45,7
His butt?


202
0:12:45,7 --> 0:12:48,767
So listen, l've scheduled
an appendectomy for you later.


203
0:12:48,767 --> 0:12:51,327
Make sure you're good on potassium.


204
0:12:51,327 --> 0:12:54,567
l got so much potassium,
it's coming out of my assium,


205
0:12:54,567 --> 0:12:58,7
you know what l mean?


206
0:12:58,7 --> 0:13:1,127
What l did was l took
the word potassium and...


207
0:13:1,127 --> 0:13:3,807
l dropped
the first three letters,


208
0:13:3,807 --> 0:13:5,327
made a doody joke.


209
0:13:5,327 --> 0:13:9,407
Funny stuff.


210
0:13:9,407 --> 0:13:12,487
- Looks like he bought it.
- Excuse me?


211
0:13:12,487 --> 0:13:15,887
So you had stage fright. No big deal.
Happened to me once.


212
0:13:15,887 --> 0:13:17,367
Really?


213
0:13:17,367 --> 0:13:21,767
l'd be more than glad to tell you what a
lot of doctors do to relieve the stress.


214
0:13:21,767 --> 0:13:24,127
Take a little trip to Palm-dale.


215
0:13:24,127 --> 0:13:25,607
- What?
- OK.


216
0:13:25,607 --> 0:13:27,967
Give yourself the old low five.


217
0:13:27,967 --> 0:13:31,527
- l'm not getting it.
- Physician...


218
0:13:31,527 --> 0:13:33,967
...love thyself.


219
0:13:33,967 --> 0:13:36,247
You talking about
Downtown Lester Brown?


220
0:13:36,247 --> 0:13:42,287
Lowers the heart rate, releases
endorphins. Basic physiology.


221
0:13:42,287 --> 0:13:44,887
OK, you almost had me.


222
0:13:44,887 --> 0:13:47,207
- You're not serious?
- Yes, l am.


223
0:13:47,207 --> 0:13:49,127
- No, you're not.
- Yes.


224
0:13:49,127 --> 0:13:53,47
No.


225
0:13:53,47 --> 0:13:55,567
Nobody hurts Carla
and gets away with it.


226
0:13:55,567 --> 0:13:57,47
Who's Carla?


227
0:13:57,47 --> 0:13:59,847
l was talking to myself.
Don't eavesdrop.


228
0:13:59,847 --> 0:14:4,447
lf this kid doesn't leave
l'm gonna kill him.


229
0:14:4,447 --> 0:14:7,327
Now, if you leave,
l'll know you were eavesdropping


230
0:14:7,327 --> 0:14:9,327
and l'll go and kill you anyway.


231
0:14:9,327 --> 0:14:14,287
Stay. Good girl.


232
0:14:14,287 --> 0:14:19,567
Tick, tock, Clarice.


233
0:14:19,567 --> 0:14:22,247
<i>Kelso's talk helped me</i>
<i>figure out what I had to do,</i>


234
0:14:22,247 --> 0:14:25,567
Good timing. Give me a hand
with this Foley cath, will you?


235
0:14:25,567 --> 0:14:29,7
<i>Whether or not Nick knew how jealous</i>
<i>and competitive I'd been</i>


236
0:14:29,7 --> 0:14:31,647
<i>I felt I needed to step up</i>
<i>lay it out there</i>


237
0:14:31,647 --> 0:14:33,967
<i>and apologise like a man,</i>


238
0:14:33,967 --> 0:14:36,47
Are we cool?


239
0:14:36,47 --> 0:14:37,487
Yeah.


240
0:14:37,487 --> 0:14:41,847
<i>Besides even if I was the star</i>
<i>for a little while he's the man now,</i>


241
0:14:41,847 --> 0:14:43,927
This belongs to you.


242
0:14:43,927 --> 0:14:46,967
Thanks a lot, man.
Can you grab me some tape?


243
0:14:46,967 --> 0:14:50,847
<i>Once you line up behind a strong leader</i>
<i>everyone picks up their game,</i>


244
0:14:50,847 --> 0:14:53,167
We need the results
of this urine sample.


245
0:14:53,167 --> 0:15:33,687
<i>We began to function</i>
<i>like a well-oiled machine,</i>


246
0:15:33,687 --> 0:15:38,167
Nick, l got the results back
from the...


247
0:15:38,167 --> 0:15:39,247
Nick?


248
0:15:39,247 --> 0:15:42,767
His blood cultures
don't look good at all.


249
0:15:42,767 --> 0:15:57,47
No problem.


250
0:15:57,47 --> 0:16:1,447
Listen, l was thinking about
what happened earlier and...


251
0:16:1,447 --> 0:16:6,327
Anyway... Here.


252
0:16:6,327 --> 0:16:9,87
You dug down in your heart
and came up with a muffin.


253
0:16:9,87 --> 0:16:12,447
That's store-bought.
Blueberries the size of your fist.


254
0:16:12,447 --> 0:16:16,7
l shouldn't have dragged you
into it. You don't know Turk.


255
0:16:16,7 --> 0:16:22,567
Actually, l met him today.
We had a terrific chat.


256
0:16:22,567 --> 0:16:26,487
Give the man a hand,
that's just terrific work.


257
0:16:26,487 --> 0:16:28,567
You know darn well that felt good.


258
0:16:28,567 --> 0:16:31,7
Feeling better about yourself,
aren't you?


259
0:16:31,7 --> 0:16:32,487
Real nice guy.


260
0:16:32,487 --> 0:16:36,767
lt's hard letting yourself be vulnerable
with someone, you know?


261
0:16:36,767 --> 0:16:43,447
Just eat the damn muffin.


262
0:16:43,447 --> 0:16:47,87
Even though l'm on call tonight,
l'm not gonna let the bad stuff in.


263
0:16:47,87 --> 0:16:49,567
Not gonna let myself get overwhelmed.
What?


264
0:16:49,567 --> 0:16:53,327
Friday, when you had people over,
you locked yourself in your room


265
0:16:53,327 --> 0:16:56,967
- because we brought the wrong chips.
- Look at me.


266
0:16:56,967 --> 0:16:59,167
That was the old Elliot.


267
0:16:59,167 --> 0:17:3,607
Help me find Dr Murdoch. Peter's parents
are here, he's not answering his page.


268
0:17:3,607 --> 0:17:17,887
Sure. You know, Elliot's not gonna
let herself be overwhelmed any more.


269
0:17:17,887 --> 0:17:26,727
She's been drinking.


270
0:17:26,727 --> 0:17:30,287
- You look great!
- You're not messing with me?


271
0:17:30,287 --> 0:17:33,487
No, but l'd like to.


272
0:17:33,487 --> 0:17:39,127
Turk bought me this dress out of
the blue. l guess he knew l'd love it.


273
0:17:39,127 --> 0:17:42,527
Look, Carla,
back when l was an intern,


274
0:17:42,527 --> 0:17:45,7
l remember the pressure
being so insane,


275
0:17:45,7 --> 0:17:47,807
that the only way l could get by
was to race home


276
0:17:47,807 --> 0:17:53,407
and although my wife was asleep,
l'd wake her, look her in the eyes,


277
0:17:53,407 --> 0:17:55,927
and then passive-aggressively
torture her


278
0:17:55,927 --> 0:18:0,527
until she packed a bag
and went to her mom's for the week.


279
0:18:0,527 --> 0:18:2,367
Does that...help?


280
0:18:2,367 --> 0:18:4,567
Like a big hug with words.


281
0:18:4,567 --> 0:18:7,927
Just cos a guy
has problems expressing himself,


282
0:18:7,927 --> 0:18:11,87
that doesn't mean
he doesn't need...


283
0:18:11,87 --> 0:18:14,247
...you.


284
0:18:14,247 --> 0:18:16,407
Women so don't get me.


285
0:18:16,407 --> 0:18:20,7
lt's not even funny.
lt's mind-boggling, quite frankly.


286
0:18:20,7 --> 0:18:22,47
The whole thing is stunning.


287
0:18:22,47 --> 0:18:24,287
The point is that
it's the scrubs, right.


288
0:18:24,287 --> 0:18:27,527
Because in jeans, my butt
is a force to be reckoned with.


289
0:18:27,527 --> 0:18:33,607
- We were looking for you.
- Nick, touch my butt, please.


290
0:18:33,607 --> 0:18:36,567
Are you all right?


291
0:18:36,567 --> 0:18:39,207
That kid is eventually gonna die.


292
0:18:39,207 --> 0:18:42,207
Whether it's today or tomorrow.


293
0:18:42,207 --> 0:18:45,167
Or a month from now.


294
0:18:45,167 --> 0:18:47,447
There's nothing l can do. Nothing works.


295
0:18:47,447 --> 0:18:50,487
His parents wanna talk to me.
What am l supposed to say?


296
0:18:50,487 --> 0:18:56,287
Peter lived a good long seven years?
Seven years, man.


297
0:18:56,287 --> 0:19:0,927
lt's not fair.
l hate this place, this job.


298
0:19:0,927 --> 0:19:3,767
- Nick, it's not your fault.
- l can't do it any more.


299
0:19:3,767 --> 0:19:6,847
l'm done. l'm done.


300
0:19:6,847 --> 0:19:11,207
<i>The scariest thing was I thought</i>
<i>he was stronger than all of us,</i>


301
0:19:11,207 --> 0:19:13,407
<i>Maybe it's not about being the best,</i>


302
0:19:13,407 --> 0:19:17,247
<i>Maybe it's about finding little things</i>
<i>that get you through the day,</i>


303
0:19:17,247 --> 0:19:22,607
<i>Whether it's the support</i>
<i>of someone close to you</i>


304
0:19:22,607 --> 0:19:27,887
<i>or letting yourself feel overwhelmed</i>


305
0:19:27,887 --> 0:19:32,967
<i>if only for a moment,</i>


306
0:19:32,967 --> 0:19:42,87
<i>Or being selfless every once in a while,</i>


307
0:19:42,87 --> 0:19:43,927
<i>I don't know,</i>


308
0:19:43,927 --> 0:19:47,487
<i>I guess in the end</i>
<i>it's about surviving</i>


309
0:19:47,487 --> 0:19:52,887
<i>any way you can,</i>


310
0:19:52,887 --> 0:19:58,767
See you tomorrow.


311
0:19:58,767 --> 0:20:1,607
You're stupid.


312
0:20:1,607 --> 0:20:10,767
- That's it?
- Give it time. lt'll eat at you.


313
0:20:10,767 --> 0:20:14,607
- Am l stupid?
- Yeah, a little bit.


314
0:20:14,607 --> 0:22:14,607
Damn him!
