This is Mr. Pinkerton`s classroom
(inaudible) high school, and you are watching


2
0:0:7,299 --> 0:0:8,67
CNN STUDENT NEWS. Go Huskies!

0:0:8,67 --> 0:0:9,48
(END VIDEO CLIP)


4
0:0:9,48 --> 0:0:13,45
CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: That`s right, go Huskies.
Thanks to Mrs. Pinkerton`s class for getting


5
0:0:13,45 --> 0:0:18,57
things started today. We`re fortunate that
you sent that in. I`m Carl Azuz. Your Tuesday


6
0:0:18,57 --> 0:0:33,14
edition of CNN STUDENT NEWS is here.


7
0:0:33,14 --> 0:0:38,679
The U.S. presidential election is exactly
three weeks away. Some Americans know whom


8
0:0:38,679 --> 0:0:43,19
they are voting for, others might not have
made up their minds just yet. Now, it might


9
0:0:43,19 --> 0:0:48,37
help some people if they could directly ask
the presidential candidates questions themselves,


10
0:0:48,37 --> 0:0:53,399
and that`s exactly what some people are going
to be able to do tonight. It is the second


11
0:0:53,399 --> 0:0:57,629
U.S. presidential debate. President Barack
Obama and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt


12
0:0:57,629 --> 0:1:3,239
Romney will face off at Hofstra University
in New York. CNN is part of this, too. Candy


13
0:1:3,239 --> 0:1:7,43
Crowley, our chief political correspondent,
is moderating tonight`s event.


14
0:1:7,43 --> 0:1:11,539
You might wonder why there aren`t any third
party candidates, why there aren`t any other


15
0:1:11,539 --> 0:1:16,28
candidates in this debates. The group that
organizes them has rules for who can participate


16
0:1:16,28 --> 0:1:21,159
based on how much support a candidate has.
President Obama and Governor Romney are the


17
0:1:21,159 --> 0:1:25,96
only candidates who meet all of the requirements.
Tonight`s debate will be different from the


18
0:1:25,96 --> 0:1:30,399
one two weeks ago. It`s a town hall format,
that`s why audience members will get to ask


19
0:1:30,399 --> 0:1:32,24
the candidates questions directly.


20
0:1:32,24 --> 0:1:37,45
Athena Jones looks at what makes this format
unique.


21
0:1:37,45 --> 0:1:43,27
Round Two. President Obama and Governor Mitt
Romney face off in their second debate Tuesday,


22
0:1:43,27 --> 0:1:48,89
a town hall moderated by CNN`s Candy Crowley
who says the format presents unique challenges


23
0:1:48,89 --> 0:1:49,64
for the candidates.


24
0:1:49,64 --> 0:1:52,24
CANDY CROWLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Now, the
challenge is that they`ve got to connect,


25
0:1:52,24 --> 0:1:56,829
not just with the people that are looking
into the television, and watching them, but


26
0:1:56,829 --> 0:2:2,24
to the people that are on the stage with them,
some 80 or so undecided voters as chosen by


27
0:2:2,24 --> 0:2:7,74
Gallup. So they have to keep those folks in
mind, it`s a much more intimate and up close


28
0:2:7,74 --> 0:2:9,19
adventure with voters.


29
0:2:9,19 --> 0:2:13,45
JONES: President Obama is under pressure.
After his last turn on the debate stage, he


30
0:2:13,45 --> 0:2:14,43
got bad reviews.


31
0:2:14,43 --> 0:2:20,42
ANA NAVARRO, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: One bad
debate is losing a battle. Two bad debates


32
0:2:20,42 --> 0:2:22,33
could very well mean he loses the war.


33
0:2:22,33 --> 0:2:25,76
MARIA CARDONA, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: And
I think you`re going to see a very different


34
0:2:25,76 --> 0:2:30,67
President Obama this time around. He`s got
to be seen as being aggressive, but yet he


35
0:2:30,67 --> 0:2:32,5
can`t be seen as being overly aggressive.


36
0:2:32,5 --> 0:2:37,36
JONES: Romney has enjoyed a post debate bounce
in national polls, and a boost of confidence


37
0:2:37,36 --> 0:2:38,5
on the campaign trail.


38
0:2:38,5 --> 0:2:41,82
MITT ROMNEY, ( R ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:
There is more energy and passion people are


39
0:2:41,82 --> 0:2:42,84
getting behind this campaign.


40
0:2:42,84 --> 0:2:48,31
JONES: At a town hall without a podium and
with audience interaction, the candidates`


41
0:2:48,31 --> 0:2:53,42
style and body language can take on added
weight. At the first town hall style presidential


42
0:2:53,42 --> 0:3:0,52
debate in 1992, President George W.H. Bush
repeatedly checked his watch, a sign some


43
0:3:0,52 --> 0:3:3,21
thought that he didn`t want to be there.


44
0:3:3,21 --> 0:3:7,48
Commentators said Bill Clinton walking towards
the audience to answer a question about the


45
0:3:7,48 --> 0:3:12,41
recession highlighted his ability to connect
with voters. One thing that can make it hard


46
0:3:12,41 --> 0:3:15,47
for a candidate to be aggressive is a question
like this.


47
0:3:15,47 --> 0:3:19,85
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can we focus on the issues
and not the personalities and the mud?


48
0:3:19,85 --> 0:3:22,93
JONES: Analysts say the format could be good
for the president.


49
0:3:22,93 --> 0:3:28,37
CARDONA: He will absolutely be able to draw
from that energy, from the energy of the public


50
0:3:28,37 --> 0:3:29,59
and the crowd.


51
0:3:29,59 --> 0:3:30,88
JONES: As for Romney ...


52
0:3:30,88 --> 0:3:36,16
NAVARRO: One of his big challenges during
this entire campaign, has been not being able


53
0:3:36,16 --> 0:3:42,19
to connect with the common man and woman and
child. He`s got to be able to come across


54
0:3:42,19 --> 0:3:46,85
as connecting, he`s got to come across as
genuine, as caring as likable.


55
0:3:46,85 --> 0:3:50,82
CROWLEY: The candidate that makes the connection
with the person asking the question is also


56
0:3:50,82 --> 0:3:53,75
I think making a better connection with the
folks back home.


57
0:3:53,75 --> 0:3:54,53
(END VIDEOTAPE)


58
0:3:54,53 --> 0:4:1,66
AZUZ: On this day in history, in 1793, Marie-Antoinette
was sent to the guillotine and beheaded during


59
0:4:1,66 --> 0:4:7,16
the height of the French Revolution. In 1859,
John Brown led a raid against an armory in


60
0:4:7,16 --> 0:4:12,15
Harpers Ferry, attempting to start a revolt
that would end slavery. It was a major event


61
0:4:12,15 --> 0:4:18,66
leading up to the U.S. Civil War. And in 1995,
the Million Man March took place in Washington,


62
0:4:18,66 --> 0:4:23,54
D.C. The goal is to promote unity and values
among African Americans. It was one of the


63
0:4:23,54 --> 0:4:26,47
largest gatherings of its kind in U.S. history.


64
0:4:26,47 --> 0:4:28,3
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


65
0:4:28,3 --> 0:4:36,81
JOHN F. KENNEDY: Good evening, my fellow citizens.
This government, as promised, has maintained


66
0:4:36,81 --> 0:4:43,88
the closest surveillance of the Soviet military
buildup on the island of Cuba. Within the


67
0:4:43,88 --> 0:4:51,53
past week, unmistakable evidence has established
the fact that a series of offensive missile


68
0:4:51,53 --> 0:4:59,54
sites is now in preparation on that imprisoned
island. The purpose of this bases can be non


69
0:4:59,54 --> 0:5:6,1
other than to provide a nuclear strike capability
against the Western Hemisphere.


70
0:5:6,1 --> 0:5:14,34
In U.S. it`s called the Cuban missile crisis.
In the Soviet Union it was knows as the Caribbean


71
0:5:14,34 --> 0:5:19,87
crisis, and in Cuba it was the October crisis.
Whatever it was called, the 13 day standoff


72
0:5:19,87 --> 0:5:26,51
in 1962 brought the U.S. and the Soviet Union
right to the edge of a nuclear war. And it


73
0:5:26,51 --> 0:5:31,87
all started 50 years ago this week. That`s
when U.S. spy planes took pictures of Soviet


74
0:5:31,87 --> 0:5:37,86
missiles at launch sites in Cuba. This missiles
could carry nuclear warheads and if they were


75
0:5:37,86 --> 0:5:43,21
launched, they could hit the U.S. East Coast
in just minutes. President Kennedy`s response


76
0:5:43,21 --> 0:5:48,51
was to launch a naval blockade against Cuba.
It was designed to stop additional Soviet


77
0:5:48,51 --> 0:5:53,42
missiles from getting to the island. Kennedy
and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev negotiated


78
0:5:53,42 --> 0:5:59,35
a solution and the Soviet missiles were eventually
returned from Cuba. Omar Lopez had a front


79
0:5:59,35 --> 0:6:4,18
row seat to the Cuban missile crisis. Those
secret Soviet launch sites, one of them was


80
0:6:4,18 --> 0:6:9,32
built on Omar`s family farm. And 50 years
later, he took Patrick Oppmann out to see


81
0:6:9,32 --> 0:6:11,1
the remains of the moment in history.


82
0:6:11,1 --> 0:6:11,84
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


83
0:6:11,84 --> 0:6:16,3
PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Omar takes
us out to see what`s left of this Soviet camp


84
0:6:16,3 --> 0:6:17,12
by mule.


85
0:6:17,12 --> 0:6:22,9
OMAR LOPEZ, CUBAN FARMER: There were a lot
of them, I can`t remember, if it was five


86
0:6:22,9 --> 0:6:25,0
or six barracks of soldiers.


87
0:6:25,0 --> 0:6:30,7
OPPMANN: Now, nature has retaken the once
sprawling missile base.


88
0:6:30,7 --> 0:6:34,61
So, here in the middle of the jungle of some
of the last visible remnants of the huge Soviet


89
0:6:34,61 --> 0:6:38,25
base that was once here, and we don`t know
what this building was, but it looks like


90
0:6:38,25 --> 0:6:43,11
it was one of the huge hangars that they actually
stored the missiles in, and here are some


91
0:6:43,11 --> 0:6:49,33
of the farmers in the area, have repurposed
this enormous concrete supports and have actually


92
0:6:49,33 --> 0:6:53,77
used them to create a pen to keep their pigs
in.


93
0:6:53,77 --> 0:6:59,8
From here, we continue on foot and find the
missile launch pad with a faded plaque marking


94
0:6:59,8 --> 0:7:2,4
how close the world came to nuclear war.


95
0:7:2,4 --> 0:7:8,27
It was over this area 50 years ago that U.S.
spy planes caught the first glimpse of Soviet


96
0:7:8,27 --> 0:7:13,72
nuclear missiles. The photos they took within
just a few days would catapult much of the


97
0:7:13,72 --> 0:7:17,9
world into a panic.


98
0:7:17,9 --> 0:7:21,81
Omar said a news blackout meant he had no
idea that the missiles like the ones on the


99
0:7:21,81 --> 0:7:25,4
old farm nearly caused the U.S. to invade
Cuba.


100
0:7:25,4 --> 0:7:30,15
LOPEZ (through translator): We were lucky
that wasn`t war, after the atomic bombs and


101
0:7:30,15 --> 0:7:36,22
the sickness that would have come, there wouldn`t
have been a single Cuban left and there would


102
0:7:36,22 --> 0:7:38,83
not have been many of you left either.


103
0:7:38,83 --> 0:7:44,26
OPPMANN: To avoid war, the Soviets removed
the missiles and troops. Patrick Oppmann,


104

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today "Shoutout" goes
out to Mrs. Driggers` class at Spectrum Jr.


108
0:7:52,819 --> 0:7:55,52
- Sr. High School in Stuart, Florida.


109
0:7:55,52 --> 0:8:0,52
Which U.S. state is home to college football
teams named the Bulls, Knights, Seminoles


110
0:8:0,52 --> 0:8:2,15
and Hurricanes?


111
0:8:2,15 --> 0:8:14,36
Here we go. Is it California, Texas, Florida
or Georgia. You`ve got three seconds. Go!


112
0:8:14,36 --> 0:8:20,88
Mrs. Driggers` students probably knew this
one, because it`s their home state of Florida.


113
0:8:20,88 --> 0:8:24,36
That`s your answer and that`s your "Shoutout."

115
0:8:25,85 --> 0:8:31,18
AZUZ: So, those were all college teams. Florida
is also home to South Plantation High School`s


116
0:8:31,18 --> 0:8:36,289
Paladins. The team played its homecoming game
last week. And the Paladins third string quarterback


117
0:8:36,289 --> 0:8:41,969
had to pull double duty. That`s because she
-- yes, she -- was also crowned homecoming


118
0:8:41,969 --> 0:8:47,17
queen. Erin Damiglio (ph) didn`t get any playing
time in her team`s win, but she has been on


119
0:8:47,17 --> 0:8:51,839
the field this season, and it`s believed that
when that happened, Erin became the first


120
0:8:51,839 --> 0:8:56,949
female quarterback to play high school football
in Florida. When she was crowned homecoming


121
0:8:56,949 --> 0:9:1,43
queen, she had a teammate by her side, one
of the team`s receivers who said it was an


122
0:9:1,43 --> 0:9:3,939
honor to be there with her, was crowned king.


123
0:9:3,939 --> 0:9:9,139
We`re going to stay on the football field
for our last story, which is from CBS News.


124
0:9:9,139 --> 0:9:14,819
