STEVE SPANGLER: Ever
notice there's


3
0:0:2,31 --> 0:0:5,25
bubbles that don't pop?


4
0:0:5,25 --> 0:0:8,18
Well, they do pop when
they touch your skin.


5
0:0:8,18 --> 0:0:10,14
Why don't they pop when
they're on the carpet?


6
0:0:10,14 --> 0:0:13,14
I think I've got some answers
and some really cool things to


7
0:0:13,14 --> 0:0:17,26
do with bubbles that you
can try at home.

0:0:18,95 --> 0:0:20,99
STEVE SPANGLER: I'm Steve
Spangler, and I'm all about


10
0:0:20,99 --> 0:0:22,35
making science fun.


11
0:0:22,35 --> 0:0:25,4
For the last 20 years, I've
been teaching ways to turn


12
0:0:25,4 --> 0:0:28,5
ordinary science experiments
into unforgettable learning


13
0:0:28,5 --> 0:0:29,9
experiences.


14
0:0:29,9 --> 0:0:31,71
I have an amazing team who will
do whatever it takes to


15
0:0:31,71 --> 0:0:34,2
affect the way people
think about science.


16
0:0:34,2 --> 0:0:37,88
And to do that, I live by
one motto, "Make it big.


17
0:0:37,88 --> 0:0:39,15
Do it right.


18
0:0:39,15 --> 0:0:40,198
Give it class."


19
0:0:40,198 --> 0:0:45,18
[MUSIC PLAYING]


20
0:0:45,18 --> 0:0:46,4
STEVE SPANGLER: Well, if we're
going to talk about bubbles,


21
0:0:46,4 --> 0:0:48,13
we need to start with
bubble solution.


22
0:0:48,13 --> 0:0:50,43
And contrary to popular belief,
it's not as easy as


23
0:0:50,43 --> 0:0:54,12
just taking soap and
adding it to water.


24
0:0:54,12 --> 0:0:56,9
It probably will give you
bubbles, but not the kind


25
0:0:56,9 --> 0:0:57,21
we're looking for.


26
0:0:57,21 --> 0:0:59,6
Well, if we're going to make
great bubble solution, you've


27
0:0:59,6 --> 0:1:0,33
got to start with the
right things.


28
0:1:0,33 --> 0:1:1,95
First of all, clean glassware.


29
0:1:1,95 --> 0:1:3,92
So I don't want to use something
that's dirty.


30
0:1:3,92 --> 0:1:6,156
I'm trying to keep this
as pure as possible.


31
0:1:6,156 --> 0:1:8,7
And clean water.


32
0:1:8,7 --> 0:1:9,77
Now what makes clean water?


33
0:1:9,77 --> 0:1:11,7
How about distilled water?


34
0:1:11,7 --> 0:1:14,56
Eight ounces of distilled
water, 240 milliliters.


35
0:1:14,56 --> 0:1:17,11
And of course, that's
just for the purist.


36
0:1:17,11 --> 0:1:20,0
The minerals, or sometimes the
things that are in regular tap


37
0:1:20,0 --> 0:1:21,36
water, they say, can hinder the


38
0:1:21,36 --> 0:1:23,6
formation of great bubbles.


39
0:1:23,6 --> 0:1:24,36
Take it for what it's worth.


40
0:1:24,36 --> 0:1:27,38
We're using distilled water
for these bubbles.


41
0:1:27,38 --> 0:1:29,13
Soap, dish soap.


42
0:1:29,13 --> 0:1:31,42
Now we're not looking for
anything other than the


43
0:1:31,42 --> 0:1:34,26
cheapest generic kind
of dish soap, Dawn,


44
0:1:34,26 --> 0:1:35,6
Lemon Joy, any of those.


45
0:1:35,6 --> 0:1:38,22
We just want stuff that doesn't
have apple, lemon,


46
0:1:38,22 --> 0:1:41,8
orchard scented, H1N1-killing.


47
0:1:41,8 --> 0:1:44,21
You just want just good,
generic soap.


48
0:1:44,21 --> 0:1:47,25
Into our eight ounces,
we're going to add a


49
0:1:47,25 --> 0:1:49,46
tablespoon of soap.


50
0:1:49,46 --> 0:1:52,7
For our metric people out there,
we're adding about 15


51
0:1:52,7 --> 0:1:55,47
milliliters of our Dawn
dish soap to the 240


52
0:1:55,47 --> 0:1:56,97
milliliters of water.


53
0:1:56,97 --> 0:2:0,5
And this is the basis of
our bubble solution.


54
0:2:0,5 --> 0:2:1,97
Well, now that you have
bubble solution, you


55
0:2:1,97 --> 0:2:4,1
need a bubble wand.


56
0:2:4,1 --> 0:2:6,52
Don't go to the store and
buy a bubble wand.


57
0:2:6,52 --> 0:2:8,0
I've got a better one for you.


58
0:2:8,0 --> 0:2:11,52
And they're made out of these
things here called, pipettes.


59
0:2:11,52 --> 0:2:14,78
If you've been in a chemistry
class, these are plastic eye


60
0:2:14,78 --> 0:2:16,1
droppers, so to speak.


61
0:2:16,1 --> 0:2:18,6
They're used to transfer a
little bit of liquid from one


62
0:2:18,6 --> 0:2:19,5
place to the next.


63
0:2:19,5 --> 0:2:21,62
You can see, when you squeeze,
that actually you can pull up


64
0:2:21,62 --> 0:2:24,26
some liquid and actually
transfer it to another place.


65
0:2:24,26 --> 0:2:25,39
But we don't want to transfer
the liquid.


66
0:2:25,39 --> 0:2:27,905
We actually want to use this
as the bubble wand.


67
0:2:27,905 --> 0:2:30,57
And for that, we're going to
need a pair of scissors.


68
0:2:30,57 --> 0:2:31,55
The trick here is simple.


69
0:2:31,55 --> 0:2:36,7
You're just going to cut the
very end of the pipette off.


70
0:2:36,7 --> 0:2:37,12
And that's what you need.


71
0:2:37,12 --> 0:2:39,61
This becomes our end for
the bubble solution.


72
0:2:39,61 --> 0:2:41,96
This becomes the end where
you put your mouth.


73
0:2:41,96 --> 0:2:43,58
This works so well because,
watch this.


74
0:2:43,58 --> 0:2:44,41
See the little pipette?


75
0:2:44,41 --> 0:2:45,83
This end goes in.


76
0:2:45,83 --> 0:2:48,54
And now there's just enough
bubble solution there.


77
0:2:48,54 --> 0:2:53,92
It doesn't matter how hard I
push the air through this, I


78
0:2:53,92 --> 0:2:55,43
get a great bubble.


79
0:2:55,43 --> 0:2:57,39
And I can shake the bubble
off like this.


80
0:2:57,39 --> 0:2:59,42
And I've got a perfect
little bubble.


81
0:2:59,42 --> 0:3:2,1
It's not strong, but I
got a great bubble.


82
0:3:2,1 --> 0:3:4,77
If you want a stronger bubble,
however, it means that we have


83
0:3:4,77 --> 0:3:6,97
to go back and add something to
this bubble solution that


84
0:3:6,97 --> 0:3:8,96
will help strengthen
the bubble.


85
0:3:8,96 --> 0:3:10,7
The secret is glycerine.


86
0:3:10,7 --> 0:3:13,49
Glycerine is this water soluble,
very viscous kind of


87
0:3:13,49 --> 0:3:16,21
material that is perfect for
the bubble solution.


88
0:3:16,21 --> 0:3:18,81
And the best bubble solution has
always had the recipe of


89
0:3:18,81 --> 0:3:20,7
water, soap and glycerine.


90
0:3:20,7 --> 0:3:23,95
I can tell you that, if I put
a tablespoon of the soap


91
0:3:23,95 --> 0:3:26,85
inside the cup of water here,
I'm only going to use about a


92
0:3:26,85 --> 0:3:27,91
half a tablespoon of this.


93
0:3:27,91 --> 0:3:29,83
It's pretty expensive stuff,
and I just don't need it.


94
0:3:29,83 --> 0:3:33,12
So about a half a tablespoon or
about 8 milliliters or so,


95
0:3:33,12 --> 0:3:34,12
that's perfect.


96
0:3:34,12 --> 0:3:35,15
This goes in here.


97
0:3:35,15 --> 0:3:37,1
You can actually see it's
kind of viscous


98
0:3:37,1 --> 0:3:38,1
here at the very bottom.


99
0:3:38,1 --> 0:3:39,1
See how it falls in?


100
0:3:39,1 --> 0:3:41,96
So it means you're going
to need to stir it up.


101
0:3:41,96 --> 0:3:43,54
You notice how it stirs
up a little bit?


102
0:3:43,54 --> 0:3:45,2
You can see it mixing.


103
0:3:45,2 --> 0:3:46,8
And while you might think
it's completely mixed


104
0:3:46,8 --> 0:3:48,84
right now, it's not.


105
0:3:48,84 --> 0:3:50,82
The secret here is time.


106
0:3:50,82 --> 0:3:53,1
Let this bubble solution
sit for 24 hours.


107
0:3:53,1 --> 0:3:55,74
And at the end of that, you're
going to have great bubbles.


108
0:3:55,74 --> 0:3:56,99
You just have to wait.


109
0:3:56,99 --> 0:4:1,207



110
0:4:1,207 --> 0:4:39,33
[MUSIC PLAYING]


111
0:4:39,33 --> 0:4:41,49
STEVE SPANGLER: Or I guess I
should have noticed that this


112
0:4:41,49 --> 0:4:45,0
batch had been actually sitting
around for 24 hours.


113
0:4:45,0 --> 0:4:46,28
Thanks, Higginsworth.


114
0:4:46,28 --> 0:4:48,44
A little labeling would
have been nice.


115
0:4:48,44 --> 0:4:49,87
You can see, when you blow a
bubble, look at how much


116
0:4:49,87 --> 0:4:52,9
surface area you have
on that bubble.


117
0:4:52,9 --> 0:4:53,69
You could imagine all the
water here trying to


118
0:4:53,69 --> 0:4:55,5
evaporate, just like you
stepping out of the shower.


119
0:4:55,5 --> 0:4:56,6
And you're cold.


120
0:4:56,6 --> 0:4:57,68
And all that water
is evaporating.


121
0:4:57,68 --> 0:4:59,15
Same thing happens here.


122
0:4:59,15 --> 0:5:1,34
That's what really causes the
bubble to pop, when you're


123
0:5:1,34 --> 0:5:2,23
holding it like this.


124
0:5:2,23 --> 0:5:5,88
The glycerine chemically holds
the water in tighter so that


125
0:5:5,88 --> 0:5:9,6
it keeps it as a longer-lasting
bubble.


126
0:5:9,6 --> 0:5:11,57
Silly thing, though,
is it still pops.


127
0:5:11,57 --> 0:5:13,67
Remember how the bubble didn't
pop on the carpet?


128
0:5:13,67 --> 0:5:14,89
Well, I think I found
a way to bring the


129
0:5:14,89 --> 0:5:17,6
carpet to your hands.


130
0:5:17,6 --> 0:5:19,87
You just have to get one of
these silly looking gloves.


131
0:5:19,87 --> 0:5:20,9
It's just a kid's glove.


132
0:5:20,9 --> 0:5:22,84
It's a mixture of polyester
and cotton.


133
0:5:22,84 --> 0:5:24,0
It doesn't really matter.


134
0:5:24,0 --> 0:5:26,1
The key here is that
it's cloth.


135
0:5:26,1 --> 0:5:29,35
And the other key here is that
it's not touching my skin.


136
0:5:29,35 --> 0:5:32,7
See, what pops the bubble
is the oil and the dirt


137
0:5:32,7 --> 0:5:33,17
that's on my skin.


138
0:5:33,17 --> 0:5:35,77
If I could use this as the
barrier to help cushion it, I


139
0:5:35,77 --> 0:5:38,61
might be able to bounce
the bubble on my hand.


140
0:5:38,61 --> 0:5:40,8
All right, here's what
we've learned so far.


141
0:5:40,8 --> 0:5:42,36
Perfect bubble solution, a
combination of distilled


142
0:5:42,36 --> 0:5:46,655
water, Dawn dish soap and some
glycerine to keep the water


143
0:5:46,655 --> 0:5:47,95
from evaporating.


144
0:5:47,95 --> 0:5:49,1
We've got a great bubble wand.


145
0:5:49,1 --> 0:5:49,86
This is a pipette.


146
0:5:49,86 --> 0:5:51,68
And you've got the glove.


147
0:5:51,68 --> 0:5:54,0
Watch this.


148
0:5:54,0 --> 0:5:58,74
You have a recipe for the
perfect bouncing bubble.


149
0:5:58,74 --> 0:6:2,27
As soon as it touches my skin,
of course, it pops.


150
0:6:2,27 --> 0:6:6,9
This will keep you busy for
days upon days upon days.


151
0:6:6,9 --> 0:6:8,93
Ever notice that bubbles
are always round?


152
0:6:8,93 --> 0:6:10,1
It doesn't take a rocket
scientist to


153
0:6:10,1 --> 0:6:10,84
figure it out, right?


154
0:6:10,84 --> 0:6:13,38
You've got equal pressures
pushing and pulling in all


155
0:6:13,38 --> 0:6:14,12
directions.


156
0:6:14,12 --> 0:6:16,78
It's just a perfect sphere.


157
0:6:16,78 --> 0:6:18,73
But what if it wasn't
a perfect sphere?


158
0:6:18,73 --> 0:6:21,37
Could you actually change the
way that bubble looks and


159
0:6:21,37 --> 0:6:24,39
change the shape by using
some outside help?


160
0:6:24,39 --> 0:6:25,44
You can.


161
0:6:25,44 --> 0:6:28,4
That's where these building
toys come on.


162
0:6:28,4 --> 0:6:31,17
See, these building toys
are called Zometool.


163
0:6:31,17 --> 0:6:31,69
They're great.


164
0:6:31,69 --> 0:6:32,69
You could use anything
you want.


165
0:6:32,69 --> 0:6:36,2
I really like these, because it
just makes a perfect cube


166
0:6:36,2 --> 0:6:38,54
using these struts that are
right here and these great


167
0:6:38,54 --> 0:6:40,22
little spheres.


168
0:6:40,22 --> 0:6:42,77
Granted, it's not the least
expensive way to do it, but


169
0:6:42,77 --> 0:6:45,31
Zometool is the perfect
way to make the


170
0:6:45,31 --> 0:6:47,52
perfect cube for bubbles.


171
0:6:47,52 --> 0:6:49,57
Now, if you have a hard time
finding building structures


172
0:6:49,57 --> 0:6:54,12
like this, you always can use
pipe cleaners and straws.


173
0:6:54,12 --> 0:6:55,48
It's easy.


174
0:6:55,48 --> 0:6:58,78
You just put the pipe cleaner
through the straw like this,


175
0:6:58,78 --> 0:7:0,68
bend it, add another one.


176
0:7:0,68 --> 0:7:1,7
You get the idea.


177
0:7:1,7 --> 0:7:4,29
Ultimately, you'll come
up with this.


178
0:7:4,29 --> 0:7:6,69
Either one works well.


179
0:7:6,69 --> 0:7:10,6
A bigger container of bubble
solution, and you get this.


180
0:7:10,6 --> 0:7:11,17
Now watch.


181
0:7:11,17 --> 0:7:13,21
When you pull it up, you
get this surface


182
0:7:13,21 --> 0:7:14,64
structure of this film.


183
0:7:14,64 --> 0:7:17,82
And as you twist it, the film
does exactly what it's


184
0:7:17,82 --> 0:7:18,39
supposed to do.


185
0:7:18,39 --> 0:7:22,48
It tries to maximize the area
there using the least number


186
0:7:22,48 --> 0:7:24,51
of lines or connecting points.


187
0:7:24,51 --> 0:7:26,58
And you get this really
cool structure.


188
0:7:26,58 --> 0:7:27,5
Now watch.


189
0:7:27,5 --> 0:7:28,46
See the little trampoline
that's there?


190
0:7:28,46 --> 0:7:31,78
By simply shaking it,
you can make it go


191
0:7:31,78 --> 0:7:36,42
this way or this way.


192
0:7:36,42 --> 0:7:38,502
What's this cool shape called?


193
0:7:38,502 --> 0:7:39,4
I don't have a clue.


194
0:7:39,4 --> 0:7:41,483
You're going to have to find a
really smart math teacher, or


195
0:7:41,483 --> 0:7:42,91
ask the people over
at Numberphile.


196
0:7:42,91 --> 0:7:45,48
They know.


197
0:7:45,48 --> 0:7:48,21
When does a round bubble
turn into a square?


198
0:7:48,21 --> 0:7:50,67
When you do this.


199
0:7:50,67 --> 0:7:51,92
Bam!


200
0:7:51,92 --> 0:7:55,15



201
0:7:55,15 --> 0:7:57,5
Oh, you see that bubble
inside the bubble?


202
0:7:57,5 --> 0:7:59,28
There's got to be a way to be
able to keep the bubble inside


203
0:7:59,28 --> 0:8:0,295
the bubble.


204
0:8:0,295 --> 0:8:2,32
I think I've got a way
to do that too.


205
0:8:2,32 --> 0:8:6,19
You see, for this, you use
the same bubble solution.


206
0:8:6,19 --> 0:8:8,78
We just need a different
bubble toy.


207
0:8:8,78 --> 0:8:10,33
And that's where
this comes in.


208
0:8:10,33 --> 0:8:12,67
So where do you get this
cool bubble wand?


209
0:8:12,67 --> 0:8:13,7
Probably the same place
you bought all of the


210
0:8:13,7 --> 0:8:14,76
other bubble junk.


211
0:8:14,76 --> 0:8:15,1
I don't know.


212
0:8:15,1 --> 0:8:16,4
It's just a toy.


213
0:8:16,4 --> 0:8:17,38
But you want this loop.


214
0:8:17,38 --> 0:8:18,36
You could just make
it at home.


215
0:8:18,36 --> 0:8:19,97
All you really want
is this loop.


216
0:8:19,97 --> 0:8:22,7
These things on the outside
really don't help me at all,


217
0:8:22,7 --> 0:8:24,41
other than it just holds the
bubble solution, because what


218
0:8:24,41 --> 0:8:28,5
we need is to hold that bubble
solution in place.


219
0:8:28,5 --> 0:8:29,68
See the film that's there?


220
0:8:29,68 --> 0:8:34,82
That film gives us the perfect
making for a bubble.


221
0:8:34,82 --> 0:8:36,52
This part just takes a little
bit of practice.


222
0:8:36,52 --> 0:8:39,72
But if you're like me, you'll
get it in no time.


223
0:8:39,72 --> 0:8:40,4
Ready?


224
0:8:40,4 --> 0:8:41,402
Oh, shoot.


225
0:8:41,402 --> 0:8:42,34
Sorry.


226
0:8:42,34 --> 0:8:43,51
HIGGINSWORTH: Spangler Effect,
Bubble Inside A


227
0:8:43,51 --> 0:8:44,59
Bubble, take two.


228
0:8:44,59 --> 0:8:45,37
You got this.


229
0:8:45,37 --> 0:8:47,49
STEVE SPANGLER: So if you're
like me, it'll take no time at


230
0:8:47,49 --> 0:8:49,12
all, just a little tiny
bit of practice.


231
0:8:49,12 --> 0:8:51,19
You pull like this, and
you'll get the bubble.


232
0:8:51,19 --> 0:8:51,62
Perfect.


233
0:8:51,62 --> 0:8:52,75
Oh.


234
0:8:52,75 --> 0:8:53,99
HIGGINSWORTH: Spangler Effect,
Bubble Inside A


235
0:8:53,99 --> 0:8:55,812
Bubble, take three.


236
0:8:55,812 --> 0:8:57,59
STEVE SPANGLER: If you're like
me, it takes no time at all,


237
0:8:57,59 --> 0:8:59,18
just a little bit of practice.


238
0:8:59,18 --> 0:8:59,63
Watch this.


239
0:8:59,63 --> 0:9:1,49
You get your bubble like this.


240
0:9:1,49 --> 0:9:2,39
God.


241
0:9:2,39 --> 0:9:5,35
HIGGINSWORTH: Bubble Inside
A Bubble, take seven.


242
0:9:5,35 --> 0:9:6,2
STEVE SPANGLER: In
no time at all,


243
0:9:6,2 --> 0:9:7,19
you'll have this mastered.


244
0:9:7,19 --> 0:9:8,725
You just pull the bubble
like this.


245
0:9:8,725 --> 0:9:11,51



246
0:9:11,51 --> 0:9:14,59
HIGGINSWORTH: Bubble Inside
A Bubble, take 37.


247
0:9:14,59 --> 0:9:15,98
STEVE SPANGLER: In no time at
all, you will have a bubble


248
0:9:15,98 --> 0:9:18,3
inside of a bubble like this,
because you just pull it like


249
0:9:18,3 --> 0:9:20,85
this and it'll--


250
0:9:20,85 --> 0:9:21,51
oh, god.


251
0:9:21,51 --> 0:9:24,12
HIGGINSWORTH: Take 48.


252
0:9:24,12 --> 0:9:25,59
STEVE SPANGLER: In no time at
all, you'll have a bubble


253
0:9:25,59 --> 0:9:26,25
inside of a bubble.


254
0:9:26,25 --> 0:9:27,8
You just simply pull--


255
0:9:27,8 --> 0:9:29,58
HIGGINSWORTH: Take 49.


256
0:9:29,58 --> 0:9:31,566
STEVE SPANGLER: In no time at
all, you will be a bubble--


257
0:9:31,566 --> 0:9:33,16
HIGGINSWORTH: Take 50.


258
0:9:33,16 --> 0:9:34,57
STEVE SPANGLER: You're going
to be a bubble master.


259
0:9:34,57 --> 0:9:36,0
With just a little bit of--


260
0:9:36,0 --> 0:9:40,82
HIGGINSWORTH: Take 51.


261
0:9:40,82 --> 0:9:43,48
STEVE SPANGLER: In no time at
all, you will be a bubble


262
0:9:43,48 --> 0:9:48,25
master, because you're going to
get a bubble that is inside


263
0:9:48,25 --> 0:9:49,97
of a bubble that falls
on the table.


264
0:9:49,97 --> 0:9:51,41
HIGGINSWORTH: Take 52.


265
0:9:51,41 --> 0:9:53,46
STEVE SPANGLER: So if you're
like me, it'll take no time at


266
0:9:53,46 --> 0:9:55,8
all, just a little tiny
bit of practice.


267
0:9:55,8 --> 0:9:55,95
You pull like this.


268
0:9:55,95 --> 0:9:57,0
And you'll get the bubble.


269
0:9:57,0 --> 0:9:59,62
And now you've got to catch
the bubble upside down.


270
0:9:59,62 --> 0:10:1,31
So you see how we're catching
it this way?


271
0:10:1,31 --> 0:10:3,84
So it's inverted on
the bubble wand.


272
0:10:3,84 --> 0:10:5,34
And now you're going
to puff a bubble in


273
0:10:5,34 --> 0:10:7,73
the bubble like that.


274
0:10:7,73 --> 0:10:11,506



275
0:10:11,506 --> 0:10:13,26
See, I've been teaching teachers
how to blow the


276
0:10:13,26 --> 0:10:14,91
bubble inside the bubble
for years.


277
0:10:14,91 --> 0:10:16,25
And all the kids are the same.


278
0:10:16,25 --> 0:10:18,39
They want to be the bubble
inside the bubble.


279
0:10:18,39 --> 0:10:20,34
So what would it take
for you to be the


280
0:10:20,34 --> 0:10:22,66
bubble inside the bubble?


281
0:10:22,66 --> 0:10:24,53
Bigger tools.


282
0:10:24,53 --> 0:10:26,74
Higginsworth, get the
swimming pool.


283
0:10:26,74 --> 0:10:28,27
Well, you saw a bubble
inside of a bubble.


284
0:10:28,27 --> 0:10:30,25
And now you want to be
inside the bubble?


285
0:10:30,25 --> 0:10:31,22
This is what you're
going to need.


286
0:10:31,22 --> 0:10:31,92
Take a look.


287
0:10:31,92 --> 0:10:33,35
This is a swimming pool
that has about


288
0:10:33,35 --> 0:10:34,87
five gallons of water.


289
0:10:34,87 --> 0:10:37,3
To that, we have our dish soap,


290
0:10:37,3 --> 0:10:38,19
and we have our glycerine.


291
0:10:38,19 --> 0:10:40,32
And again, we just played with
the quantities, until we got a


292
0:10:40,32 --> 0:10:41,47
good solution.


293
0:10:41,47 --> 0:10:43,6
The key here, 24 hours.


294
0:10:43,6 --> 0:10:44,52
Let it sit.


295
0:10:44,52 --> 0:10:47,68
And we've started playing with
this hula hoop that's here.


296
0:10:47,68 --> 0:10:50,38
And while that's OK, it's not
nearly as good as this little


297
0:10:50,38 --> 0:10:54,69
contraption we made just using
sprinkler irrigation pipe.


298
0:10:54,69 --> 0:10:56,25
So it didn't take much of it.


299
0:10:56,25 --> 0:10:58,14
A little trip to the hardware
store, and we're set.


300
0:10:58,14 --> 0:11:1,66
And this gives you, now, this
beautiful bubble film.


301
0:11:1,66 --> 0:11:3,4
Look at this.


302
0:11:3,4 --> 0:11:6,89
Now the object would be to put a
kid inside the bubble or put


303
0:11:6,89 --> 0:11:8,25
you inside the bubble.


304
0:11:8,25 --> 0:11:12,68
That just means that you've
got to find a kid.


305
0:11:12,68 --> 0:11:13,83
And I think I found one.


306
0:11:13,83 --> 0:11:15,3
Here's a kid.


307
0:11:15,3 --> 0:11:16,56
Here you go, kid.


308
0:11:16,56 --> 0:11:20,12
And if they're wearing safety
glasses, it's all the better.


309
0:11:20,12 --> 0:11:22,51
And if they're named
Ella, it's perfect.


310
0:11:22,51 --> 0:11:23,11
Is your name Ella?


311
0:11:23,11 --> 0:11:23,4
ELLA: Mm-hm.


312
0:11:23,4 --> 0:11:23,57
STEVE SPANGLER: See?


313
0:11:23,57 --> 0:11:24,64
This is perfect.


314
0:11:24,64 --> 0:11:25,89
All right, here we go.


315
0:11:25,89 --> 0:11:27,98



316
0:11:27,98 --> 0:11:29,16
Nice!


317
0:11:29,16 --> 0:11:30,38
I know what you're thinking.


318
0:11:30,38 --> 0:11:32,42
Can you do it with two kids?


319
0:11:32,42 --> 0:11:33,815
Here's another kid.


320
0:11:33,815 --> 0:11:36,22
In you go, kid.


321
0:11:36,22 --> 0:11:39,1
All right, two kids.


322
0:11:39,1 --> 0:11:40,13
Here, just hug.


323
0:11:40,13 --> 0:11:40,99
Pretend like you're sisters.


324
0:11:40,99 --> 0:11:41,505
Are you sisters?


325
0:11:41,505 --> 0:11:41,77
ELLA: Mm-hm.


326
0:11:41,77 --> 0:11:42,2
FEMALE SPEAKER: Mm-hm.


327
0:11:42,2 --> 0:11:42,94
STEVE SPANGLER: Oh,
this is perfect.


328
0:11:42,94 --> 0:11:43,92
All right, stay there.


329
0:11:43,92 --> 0:11:44,37
Don't move.


330
0:11:44,37 --> 0:11:44,76
Ready?


331
0:11:44,76 --> 0:11:46,1
Go!


332
0:11:46,1 --> 0:11:48,6



333
0:11:48,6 --> 0:11:49,51
You're in a bubble!


334
0:11:49,51 --> 0:11:51,6
That was awesome!


335
0:11:51,6 --> 0:11:53,45
All right, hey guys, sorry
about the mess.


336
0:11:53,45 --> 0:11:55,39
Can you get that all cleaned
up for me and everything?


337
0:11:55,39 --> 0:11:56,29
I've got lot to do.


338
0:11:56,29 --> 0:11:56,965
I've got to go.


339
0:11:56,965 --> 0:11:57,59
Bye.


340
0:11:57,59 --> 0:11:58,84
See you guys later.

[MAKING  MOTOR NOISES]

0:12:17,481 --> 0:12:19,429
Where did you come from?


344
0:12:19,429 --> 0:12:20,77
I'm bigger than you are.


345
0:12:20,77 --> 0:12:22,2
And I'm newer than you are.


346
0:12:22,2 --> 0:12:23,9
And I am--


347
0:12:23,9 --> 0:12:23,36
oops.

Oh, my god.
