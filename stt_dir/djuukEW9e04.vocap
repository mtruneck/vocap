###9 MALE SPEAKER 1: One second, just keep going.
###11 PATRICK O'DELL: Hey, were going to Autumn's Skate Shop
###13 to meet with Tim O'Connor.
###14 And I brought a sharpie and a Thrasher.
###17 And we're going to watch him wreck people because that's
###21 what he's good at.
###22 TIM O'CONNOR: All right.
###23 PATRICK O'DELL: What about that?
###25 TIM O'CONNOR: Oh my god, right off the fucking bat here.
###27 Wait, what's up with cursing and stuff?
###30 It doesn't matter.
###31 It's the internet.
###31 PATRICK O'DELL: Yeah, we can bleep it out.
###32 TIM O'CONNOR: OK, jumping Jehoshaphats.
###34 First of all, never ever combine extreme sports, OK?
###40 Never make a hybrid of the two.
###42 This is his ad.
###44 PATRICK O'DELL: You think he landed that?
###45 TIM O'CONNOR: He might have landed this.
###50 There's nothing to say.
###51 I like this.
###51 It's what I like to see.
###52 He's been spared, except he is going to get an Afro.
###56 I once looked at a magazine that somebody did back in the
###59 day when I was at skate camp, and every single human being
###62 in the magazine they drew an Afro on.
###65 Let me do a Neck Face drawing because that guy seems to be
###67 everywhere.
###68 Hey what does this stuff look like?
###70 What is going on right here?
###72 One ad.
###73 He got on a team and he was just like, I
###75 got one add in me.
###76 And this is it.
###77 He does it and he dies.
###80 It doesn't even have the name of the kid on this ad.
###83 But maybe it's like introducing a kid, but they're
###86 also outroducing him because he died right after he did
###89 this first trick for his Hawk clothing.
###92 [BIRD NOISE]
###95 You guys have no qualms of me making fun of people.
###97 Oh my god.
###100 Oh my god.
###101 Is it a joke, or is it like I dare you to do that trick with
###105 these pants on?
###107 Or is it purposeful?
###110 That's the question.
###112 This is, you know how you have those old photos of yourself
###114 when you're a younger kid and you're like embarrassed like,
###116 oh God, what was I wearing?
###117 And like, ew, you know?
###118 I wonder if they're going to look back at these photos and
###120 just be all embarrassed.
###122 I feel bad.
###123 This is mean.
###126 I'm going to be the guy that gets fucked up.
###127 I'm going to get beat up.
###128 Hold up.
###129 [FART SOUND]
###131 Did you get that?
###132 Because that hurt.
###134 I wasn't there, but a photographer that was on a
###137 trip with these guys told me-- this was
###139 an exact quote verbatim--
###143 one of the guys at the demo, one of his team riders said,
###146 "Permission to rip, sir." And Jamie Thomas, right back at
###150 him, said "Permission granted, soldier." And then they just
###152 went in and landed everything and won the demo.
###157 I need that thing.
###158 I need that thing to hide my voice.
###159 
###161 Yes, you are good.
###163 But apparently not at dressing.
###165 And I put a little PS, a post script in there, because he's
###168 holding a gun.
###169 A gat, if you will.
###171 And I said PS, please don't shoot me with that gun there.
###177 I don't want to get shot.
###180 Unless it will up my board sales.
###182 Like fucking 50 Cent or something.
###184 What's happening right here?
###185 
###189 Is God looking at him at this moment or something?
###193 Look at the magical ray of light that's shining upon him.
###197 And yes, he is putting a record into that thing.
###200 Is that real?
###201 Do they really make those?
###202 PATRICK O'DELL: I don't think so.
###205 I think it's a Photoshop.
###207 Or you think they really make one of those?
###209 TIM O'CONNOR: Maybe.
###210 I mean, it looks huge and outrageous.
###212 PATRICK O'DELL: Well if they make one, [INAUDIBLE]
###215 would have it.
###216 TIM O'CONNOR: Yeah, it's true.
###217 This is true.
###218
