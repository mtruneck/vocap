###0 [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
###21 TREVOR GRAVES: In Portland I own Nemo Design with a couple
###23 other guys and we have a 20,000 square foot building.
###26 And Dave Seoane rents the basement.
###28 So he's part of our folklore.
###30 And when people come through the shop and do the factory
###32 tour and they're like, "yeah, there's this weird guy that
###35 lives in the basement."
###36 The editors come in.
###38 "Hey, we're going to do a story about Nemo.
###39 And Dave steals the show.
###40 It's always about Dave.
###42 So that's cool.
###43 We like it that way.
###44 DAVE SEOANE: Well I guess I could-- the truth is--
###48 can I say anything about the fire marshals, or--
###51 because technically this space, which I don't live
###55 here, because you're not supposed to live here.
###57 But I do get tired and I do have to take naps here.
###60 So the couch is not a good place to really
###64 concentrate and focus.
###65 So this is why I built the Mobile Sleeping Device that
###68 you can wheel around anywhere in the house.
###74 It has a complete surround sound, bed, the bare basics.
###80 I have this.
###81 This is my tactic in case anybody breaks in.
###84 What are you going to do?
###85 Are you going to shoot them?
###86 I don't have a gun.
###87 So you take this and you just go [SIREN SOUND]
###93 That would scare the shit out of you, right, if you walked
###95 into a dark warehouse trying to rob something.
###97 You'd run.
###100 I don't know.
###102 That's my theory.
###103 
###106 But the best room is this one right here.
###109 This is the room the fire marshal [INAUDIBLE].
###111 
###115 Every room should have a soundproof room.
###117 -Every house?
###119 DAVE SEOANE: Every house, every warehouse.
###120 
###123 This belongs to a friend of mine, Jason Brown who is a--
###127 as you can see, his set up--
###129 he's very experimental.
###132 It's got two layers of drywall.
###134 It's kind a six-inch air pocket that's insulated.
###138 And it's got another two by four wall with another two
###141 layers of sheet rock all the way around it.
###142 So it's completely--
###143 it's pretty soundproof.
###144 You can't-- you can hear, like, the lows.
###146 You can hear the kick drum.
###147 But you can't hear any of the highs at all and everything
###149 else is muted out.
###150 -That's awesome.
###151 DAVE SEOANE: So it works out really well.
###152 
###158 I have this but I have no affiliation to it.
###160 
###163 Squaw Valley art sale for $0.98.
###166 I remember as a little kid, seeing this as a skate shop,
###169 like, wow, you just put those on your skateboard and you can
###171 go down the snow?
###175 That's incredible.
###177 It was like, this old stuff.
###178 But I didn't learn on this.
###179 I learned on a Burton Backhill.
###180 But I do definitely share my respect for Shuman.
###186 He's a good man.
###190 MIKE BASICH: Dave Seoane, met him '86, Donner Ski Ranch,
###194 first contest ever entered.
###196 I actually met Chris Roach that day too, and Monty Roach,
###200 Tucker Francis.
###202 Seoane's someone I've always kind of
###204 related to pretty well.
###206 We've always been curious about creating stuff.
###210 And Dave was a bit of a scavenger in the younger age.
###216 He's always the guy who slept on someone's
###218 deck out on the curb.
###221 He was always someone that came in with a surprise and
###224 something new.
###226 
###228 DAVE SEOANE: I have the original Squaw Valley Gas
###230 Station sign that I'm going to sell to somebody that lives in
###233 Squaw Valley, for $60,000.
###239 Exhibit A, this is the--
###241 
###245 Can I interest you in an SR?
###247 A K100?
###250 Scrap yard.
###251 
###253 -Which one you shoot, though?
###255 DAVE SEOANE: I shot, probably, this ASR.
###258 This is probably the one that I use the most.
###261 This was the work horse.
###264 That thing's been all over the world.
###266 What's that?
###267 -Is that my lens?
###268 DAVE SEOANE: No
###270 TREVOR GRAVES: My relationship with Dave has been like the
###272 high school buddy you're friends with forever.
###275 Like I say, he goes, he figures out to weld, figures
###277 out how to cut movies, how to film, how to snowboard.
###280 He just kind of has that--
###282 he always wants to keep learning.
###284 I think that's why I like hanging out with him and I
###287 respect being around him.
###288 He, he gets it done, you know?
###290 He's got the best program.
###291 Dave's on the best program, I'm telling you.
###294 DAVE SEOANE: This, see this right here though?
###297 This is my future home.
###298 This is what I'm working towards right here.
###300 -This is the proper mobile home?
###302 DAVE SEOANE: This is the proper mobile home.
###303 This will be a legal mobile home.
###307 It's a 1949 Silver Streak Clipper.
###309 It's going to be put back to original form.
###313 -Are you going to chrome it and everything?
###315 DAVE SEOANE: Well you can see I polished an area here.
###318 So it is possible to get some sheen out of it.
###323 Oh, this is an English wheel.
###324 This is for pretty much bending aluminum and rolling.
###329 It's what they made cars, and that's what they made
###332 airplanes out of back in the day.
###333 Probably they're still with us today, a lot
###335 of prototype parts.
###336 But it has been taken into the motorcycle industry, and it's
###341 been popularized.
###343 This is the wood room here, which is building a lot of
###348 table tops and furniture and prototypes.
###350 So it's good to come up with ideas and concepts.
###352 And then you can come in here and build it out of wood.
###354 And then I do a lot of welding as well out there.
###356 So I can put pieces together and build it up and fab up
###359 whatever comes to mind.
###361 So it's nice.
###362 It's a complete luxury to have all this at my fingertips.
###365 
###367 MIKE BASICH: Seoane and Jamie Lynn were probably the two
###369 snowboarders that started marketing
###372 their image as artists.
###375 And Jamie was the painter and Seoane was the welder.
###379 And it's good stuff.
###381 He makes good stuff.
###384 It's stuff within reason.
###386 It's not non-purpose art.
###388 He made a chair.
###389 He needed to sit down somewhere.
###391 
###393 DAVE SEOANE: I moved to Tahoe in probably '87.
###398 In Tahoe area, I mean there was, like Terry Kidwell and
###400 Shaun Palmer, and Keith Kimmel.
###402 Like, those guys were-- and Jim Zellers and Tom Burt.
###405 Those guys were all kind of established.
###407 And it was like, Chris Roach and Palmer.
###409 Those guys were the ones that started getting
###412 sponsored by Sims.
###413 And they were the first real, like, force of--
###416 the start of getting product.
###417 
###419 This is like right after the second or third World Cup.
###423 But I think it was probably in '88 or '89 that the Cal
###428 Series, they had an event that went all around California,
###432 amateur and pro snowboard contest.
###434 And that's where Chris Roach and Tucker and everybody
###437 would, we would all tour around that.
###439 And so there's that kind of first generation.
###440 And I feel like I'm kind of the second generation with
###444 Chris Roach and Tucker Francis.
###446 Steve Graham and Damian Sanders came up to Tahoe a
###448 little bit later.
###449 So they're kind of like third wave, I should say.
###454 I didn't know Steve before Look.
###456 So we hooked up and met through Look Snowboards
###459 through Burt Lamar.
###460 STEVE GRAHAM: That was pretty much my partner in crime for
###461 traveling with and living with, because we were both on
###465 Look and filming together too.
###468 We just had so much fun back then, probably because our
###471 equipment sucked so bad.
###473 We rode for Look.
###474 And there was no real design there for years.
###478 We were both screwed.
###480 But we would make the most of it.
###483 DAMIAN SANDERS: Dave's a great guy.
###484 We actually lived together.
###485 So yeah, when Steve Graham and Dave and I all started riding
###488 together, we got this place in Donner, three or four bedroom.
###491 And they moved in with me.
###492 And it was just a blast.
###493 So three pro snowboarders living together, and my wife
###496 Brandi at the time.
###497 And we'd wake up, go to squaw, meet the rat
###499 pack, ride all day.
###500 And then back to our house.
###501 And then we kind of lived in a mountainous area.
###503 So we were always just up on the hill, building jumps,
###505 building rail slides.
###506 It was just nonstop snowboarding from the time we
###508 woke up to the time we went to sleep.
###511 DAVE SEOANE: Right at that time is when snowboarding
###512 started to get more recognized.
###515 And there was a French guy at one of the trade shows.
###518 We'd go there and these French guys were in suits.
###520 And we're like, oh shit, this is serious stuff.
###522 These guys are in suits.
###524 These guys are all biz.
###525 And the guy who was running Look, his name was Jacques
###528 Gris, this French gentleman.
###531 And we went out that night and had the funnest time ever.
###533 He was like the loosest guy I've ever met.
###535 He was hilarious.
###536 And after that, it was like, OK, no problem.
###538 I can easily work with these guys.
###541 Waking up, going to work, and complaining
###543 about work all day.
###545 If you're complaining about it so much,
###547 then why are you there?
###549 And you should just be out doing what you want to do, no
###552 matter what you're doing, as long as you're having a good
###553 time, that's all that counts.
###555 MIKE BASICH: He's the one guy that really never competed.
###558 He made a pretty new career.
###561 Because back then, everyone competed to be sponsored.
###564 And Seoane, he went straight into filming, pretty much.
###568 He did a few contests.
###569 But he got sponsored for being in Fall Line Films.
###574 TREVOR GRAVES: Usually where he works is "Snowboarder
###575 Magazine," which sponsors Snowboarders in Exile.
###578 My job was to go and cover it and make stills and write a
###581 story about whatever it was that we were doing.
###584 And so I'd sleep on Jerry's couch countless nights.
###589 And that's where I met Dave.
###591 So Seoane--
###592 it's funny, I lose track of it, actually.
###594 I've been on some of my best road trips with Seoane.
###596 Juneau, Alaska, we've been to New Zealand, so I'm stoked
###600 that we've still got a good relationship.
###603 DAVE SEOANE: Yeah, we did actually go to the contest.
###607 But it was never, we never had any pressure that we had to do
###609 good in the contest.
###610 It was more like a great way to see your buddies and have
###614 few hundred cases of beer and have a good time.
###617 Yes?
###617 -What's the most important thing to you right now?
###621 DAVE SEOANE: Trying to find a '59 dying station wagon.
###624 -And food.
###625 DAVE SEOANE: I'm not worried about food.
###627 Once I get the wagon I'll be able to drive anywhere in the
###629 world and eat.
###631 I just need to get there.
###632 MIKE BASICH: Yeah, Seoane's, like I said,
###634 he's a bit of a scavenger.
###635 I mean, I've been in Japan with him and seen him pull out
###638 an ice cream upside down in an ashtray and eat it for $10.
###643 Not because he wanted to, but mostly because he was in Japan
###646 and didn't have $10.
###650 DAVE SEOANE: The old ice cream story.
###652 Well what happened was we--
###654 Steve Graham and I were Japan.
###656 I think I had probably $23 to my name.
###659 I think Steve had, maybe-- he probably had, like $100.
###661 And I just walked by the table and they were making
###665 all these big bets.
###666 And, like, who would need this ice cream cone with cigarette
###669 butts and hair and gum on it.
###670 STEVE GRAHAM: It was Brushie, Jeff Brushie was
###672 eating this ice cream.
###673 We were all sitting around this table and it has this
###675 huge Japanese ashtray in there which just nothing but
###678 cigarette butts and gum and just all this crap.
###681 And for some reason, Brushie grabs the ice cream--
###684 yeah, Dave.
###685 Remember this one?
###686 We got the money up to like $80 or $100.
###691 And we're going to get $20 from Jacobi, even, and from
###695 him and getting $20 from him was tight.
###698 Then Dave walks up and goes, what?
###699 How much for that?
###700 Just grabs it and just, boom, take a huge bite.
###704 He was pretty much supposed to eat pretty much anything that
###707 was on that ice cream.
###708 Not the whole thing, but spit out the cigarette butts.
###712 DAVE SEOANE: And I walked by and they were like, yeah,
###715 we're not sure who's going to do it.
###716 And so I was like, wait, $120 to eat that right now?
###719 And they're like, yeah.
###720 And I just grabbed the thing and I ate it.
###722 And I spit out the cigarette butts but I ate the
###724 cigarettes.
###724 There was probably like three or four cigarettes that I ate.
###727 And that's probably the sickest I've ever been in my
###731 life, for three days.
###733 I was completely dehydrated.
###734 I couldn't take on any food or water.
###737 I shit the bed like four times.
###740 Don't eat tobacco.
###741 It's the worst thing for you ever.
###743 It was the hardest $120 I've ever made in my life.
###747 STEVE GRAHAM: He was sick for four days.
###748 But he got his--
###749 
###754 he got his electronic item he wanted the $80 for.
###757 He was sick the whole damn trip.
###760 DAVE SEOANE: No, with that money I bought beer out of the
###763 vending machine.
###764 
###768 MIKE BASICH: Sometimes after that he got so curious about
###770 the filming part, he got involved on the
###773 other side the camera.
###774 That's what he does now.
###777 JERRY DUGAN: I taught Seoane how to shoot film.
###779 Then he went off to make his own films after a while.
###782 DAVE SEOANE: I think I came into the picture doing a
###783 little bit on Critical Condition, doing
###785 the helmet cam stuff.
###787 The only reason why the helmet cam came into play is because
###790 the Blizzard of Ozz.
###791 Like, those guys were skiing with it.
###793 And the only reason I got chose to wear the helmet
###796 camera is because I was the closest to the ground and I
###798 had the fattest neck to support the thing.
###800 Because the thing probably weighed like--
###803 I think it had to weigh like 15, 20 pounds.
###805 It had a camera and then they were putting on lead pieces to
###808 counterbalance.
###809 So it was a pretty cumbersome contraption.
###812 Yeah, if you're short and have a fat neck, you're going to
###814 have a helmet cam thrown on you.
###818 The other reason I got thrown onto a helmet cam is because I
###821 can keep up with the other snowboarders.
###824 There was a trip to go to Valle Nevado, Chile with
###829 Palmer and Roach.
###830 And I wanted to go to snowboard.
###832 And there was no room to go as a snowboarder.
###834 But Jerry had offered me a chance if I wanted to go to
###837 shoot second camera angle, or third camera angle.
###840 And it wasn't even a hesitation.
###842 I just got a camera.
###844 And we did a little film test and it worked out.
###847 And I'd always had an interest in still photography.
###850 So I can adapt to the film playing.
###854 CIRCE WALLACE: Seoane is such an art fag.
###856 I don't even think he knew what an art fag
###858 he was early on.
###859 I think now he would totally embrace that title.
###862 So I think he got--
###864 I think he saw a great opportunity for him to get
###867 involved on a creative level.
###868 And I think Jerry and Artie needed it.
###871 He had a really fun idea.
###873 Let's go on a road trip.
###875 DAVE SEOANE: That's when I talked Jerry and Artie into
###877 letting me do a couple little side projects with them.
###880 And that's when I came up the concept and directed Roadkill
###885 and 8-Tracks and RPM, those three films.
###887 Which we try to do same season releases, so we'd go out the
###891 first, like November, December, January, and try to
###893 release it in February.
###895 And we did that for three years in a row.
###896 I mean snowboarding was like, the progression of it was
###898 going pretty quick.
###900 When we first did Roadkill, at the end of-- what was that?
###903 I think, like, Riders on the Storm-- at the end of that,
###905 everybody started buttering tricks and nose presses and
###908 all that funky stuff.
###910 But this was a way to, instead of waiting a whole other year
###914 to capture this and show this, was to be like, OK.
###916 This is what's going on now.
###917 So here you go.
###919 [OUT-OF-TUNE GUITAR PLAYING]
###935 JASON BORGSTEDE: Oh yeah, Roadkill and RPM, those--
###938 I think Roadkill was the first one.
###939 And that was our hard core movie.
###942 That was our first half-hour movie, just
###946 quick, quick, quick.
###947 But they put together a super sick lineup right when
###950 freestyle was really busting out, when this gear here right
###954 here was the stuff to be.
###956 Blind Jeans, what's up?
###958 And Brushie right here was killing it.
###962 And that's why, it must have been 15 years later, I'm on
###967 the internet looking to buy a Brushie board, because of
###971 those videos in those days.
###972 Reminded of the time when we were first getting into it and
###975 first really pushing to try to get better
###978 and emulate our idols.
###982 DAVE SEOANE: Roadkill was with Terje Haakonsen and John
###986 Cardiel was in it, Bryan Iguchi, Graham, Palmer, Jamie
###993 Lynn was in it, Circie was in it, a couple others that I
###998 can't think off the top my head.
###999 But that was--
###1001 we started off in Tahoe.
###1004 We took a limousine.
###1005 And then Palmer came with us with his limousine, because he
###1008 has a whole garage full of limousines for some reason.
###1011 That was like, in a matter of like a month and a half.
###1013 And that was a brutal month and a half.
###1017 And Bud Fawcett was--
###1019 we were driving down in Colorado.
###1021 We were on one of the main interstates.
###1022 And it was 11 o'clock at night and one of the belts
###1025 blew off the car.
###1027 And Bud was driving.
###1029 So luckily Bud--
###1029 I don't know how he did it-- but got us there safely.
###1032 We found a gas station.
###1033 And I'm trying to--
###1034 they're just getting ready to close.
###1035 But I found a replacement belt.
###1037 And in the car, and I'm trying to--
###1039 I mean, it's cold.
###1039 It's like 11 o'clock in the middle Colorado at night.
###1042 And then I'm--
###1043 those guys are all just hanging out,
###1044 partying in the limousine.
###1045 And I'm out there getting my hands dirty and
###1047 trying to fix this belt.
###1048 And I open the door try to get something.
###1050 And the Gooch, I remember, Bryan Iguchi, he was like,
###1053 Dave, can you shut the door?
###1055 It's cold out there.
###1056 And I was like, you fucking asshole.
###1057 And I just totally snapped at him and yelled at him so hard.
###1060 I was so pissed.
###1062 And then after they all came out of the
###1063 car, and were quiet.
###1064 And they were like, we're sorry.
###1066 Do you need a hand with anything?
###1068 And I was like, thanks you guys.
###1071 So that was one of just many little highlights.
###1074 CIRCE WALLACE: I really remember Jamie and Palmer
###1079 jumping the Donner cliffs, that
###1081 little section in Roadkill.
###1083 I remember watching Palmer backside 360 that Donner
###1086 cliff, thinking like that maybe was one of the gnarliest
###1089 things I've ever seen.
###1091 And he had that clown hairdo.
###1092 
###1096 DAVE SEOANE: Yeah, it was Jamie Lynn and Circe actually
###1098 came down from Washington to do a segment in Tahoe.
###1101 That's when we went out into the back country in Donner
###1105 Summit and just built a jump.
###1107 He was just one of the guys that I wanted to work with.
###1110 And I think Jerry already had enough
###1112 credibility where people--
###1114 they were approached by people--
###1115 that people wanted to work with them.
###1117 So it was kind of nice that they had established
###1120 themselves.
###1120 And people were coming to them and we were already kind of
###1123 grandfathered in there.
###1125 JAMIE LYNN: I just remember hiking up Donner Pass, and
###1129 Sugar Bowl, and the Donner Ski Ranch.
###1134 And the days we rode after that were the
###1136 days that were filmed--
###1137 that we got to film all the shots for Roadkill.
###1141 Because it had just snowed, like, 10 feet.
###1145 And then Tahoe is so concentrated with different
###1147 areas, you can just go from one area to the next and just
###1150 pick, like--
###1151 and with those guys's kind of pass to access that stuff, it
###1157 allowed us to get up into some really, really good snow.
###1160 Like early up, some KT-22 at Squaw Valley.
###1164 No one does that.
###1165 DAVE SEOANE: While I was making those films, Roadkill
###1168 and 8-Tracks and RPM, I was still working with Rossignol
###1170 at the time.
###1171 So I was just going to work in film.
###1173 And then Rossignol offered me a position to design and build
###1176 boards and still keep doing what I was doing.
###1179 So I couldn't say no to it.
###1180 So I was working with Rossignol, helping them design
###1182 boards and helping to promote Rossignol, and like a little
###1186 bit of film segments.
###1188 But it was kind of dying off.
###1189 And that's when I just got into more of the filmmaking
###1192 aspect of it.
###1193 And the reason why I got in the film aspect of it was just
###1196 because I had a really good relationship
###1198 with most of the riders.
###1200 So it was pretty seamless.
###1203 MIKE BASICH: I think he jumped ship just a year or two early
###1206 from the pro snowboarder to filming.
###1207 But I think he was so interested in the filming
###1209 part, he just dove into that pretty quick.
###1213 It's been good for the sport.
###1214 I mean, he's brought the athlete side of the eye more
###1218 on the other side of the camera to capture the sport a
###1221 little better from the rider's point of view.
###1225 I think Fall Line was working with him for so long he
###1228 learned a lot from them.
###1230 DAVE SEOANE: Let's get these girls to start working here.
###1233 It's getting late here.
###1235 JEFF CURTES: I always knew of him from the videos, like
###1236 watching Snowboarders in Exile, and watching him fly
###1239 off huge cliffs in Jackson Hole, but definitely part of
###1243 different circles of people.
###1245 He wasn't part of the Burton world in his pro snowboarding
###1248 scene at all.
###1249 So he was part of a Tahoe kind of scene.
###1253 So the paths really didn't cross for me until he got
###1259 behind the camera.
###1261 Burton hired him to kind of come on a shoot.
###1265 We became friends there.
###1266 He's got a really cool way about him, a really quirky
###1269 style, and really different than the way I shoot photos.
###1272 So I just watched him do his deal.
###1274 And I'm like, wow, I can learn a lot from his approach and
###1277 how he interacts with the riders and things.
###1279 Full immersion, like just, party scene?
###1283 He's in there.
###1284 Or a shred scene?
###1285 He's in there.
###1286 Like, he's such a sick rider.
###1290 And he has evolved quite a bit as well.
###1292 He was just super loose and part of the scene and would
###1295 just capture it better than anyone else.
###1296 He made Haakonsen movies, Subjekt Haakonsen.
###1299 And he's just shredding, and probably just right in there
###1302 with Terje, living the lifestyle, and just getting it
###1305 all on film.
###1306 So nothing that you can really learn.
###1308 I think you just have to be that person, be part of it.
###1312 Be a good friend first and then get the relationships on
###1314 the camera.
###1316 SHAUN WHITE: I'm not sure exactly how we met.
###1318 I know it was a long, long time ago.
###1320 We were probably either around Mount Hood or
###1323 something like that.
###1324 But all I remember was watching Subjekt Haakonsen and
###1327 just thought that was the best movie ever.
###1330 I love the riding.
###1331 I love the way it was put together and the music.
###1334 And it had a vibe to it and I liked that.
###1338 DAVE SEOANE: That came through--
###1340 I'd been friends with Richard Woolcott and been friends with
###1343 Terje at this time.
###1344 So we had kind of like thrown the idea around to do it.
###1348 So Richard Woolcott, Terje, and I, we just sat down and
###1351 talked about it to see how it would work out.
###1352 And we were like, yeah, it totally makes sense.
###1354 And Terje was totally into it.
###1356 Volcom put up the dough for it and produced it.
###1359 It was good because this was kind of before Terje would be
###1362 so like, closed off to everybody, when he was still
###1367 kind of user friendly for the public.
###1370 But he was into it, so we definitely had to take
###1373 advantage of that.
###1374 And that was a lot of fun too.
###1376 That was a lot of traveling.
###1378 Terje is, like, he's funny because once you get out there
###1381 and turn the camera on, you can't really stop him.
###1386 ANDREAS WIIG: So I had his main movie that was called
###1389 Subjekt Haakonsen.
###1390 I've probably seen it, I don't know, like 2,000 times.
###1394 I can't watch it anymore because it's a VHS and it's
###1399 just too old now.
###1401 I liked a lot of parts.
###1403 I remember I really liked the part when him and Daniel Frank
###1407 are riding the half pipe--
###1409 I think it was at Mount Hood--
###1410 and had a part together.
###1412 That's one of my favorite parts.
###1415 Other than that, there's this part where it's hailing.
###1418 He's doing this huge back flip.
###1420 The whole movie just has so much variety.
###1424 It's way more work to film a whole movie than
###1427 just to film a part.
###1428 You have to be a pretty complete rider to
###1431 be able to do that.
###1432 
###1434 At the time when his movie came out, it was for sure the
###1438 best movie ever made as far as snowboarding, trick-wise and
###1445 how technical he was riding.
###1447 Not just like technical as far as doing tricks, but just the
###1450 way he was riding the terrain.
###1453 DAVE SEOANE: Yeah, and not just through the movie, I
###1454 think, just his in general popularity.
###1458 It seemed like he's more of an icon and in the US and Japan
###1461 than he was in Europe.
###1463 I don't know if that's because he spent so
###1465 much time over here.
###1467 Because even in Norway-- it's different now.
###1470 But back then in Norway, when you'd walk around with him, he
###1472 wasn't such a recognized guy.
###1473 He was still, like, low key.
###1475 We tried to get into some club.
###1477 And he had no pull to get us in there.
###1482 But here in the US, people recognize him a lot more.
###1485 But that's changed now.
###1485 He's a big name in his hometown, or in Oslo.
###1492 What was after that?
###1493 Then I did another film with Terje, The Haakonsen Faktor.
###1498 Terje's riding had developed more into bigger free riding.
###1502 So we were just trying to capture that.
###1506 But we got skunked on so many trips.
###1507 And then it was the end of the season and we didn't really
###1509 have much in the can.
###1510 And we were like, OK, we've got to go to New Zealand.
###1512 So we'll go there for a couple weeks and see what we can get.
###1514 And then we were there for six weeks.
###1516 And there was times when--
###1518 it was like, Iker Fernandez, Michi Albin, the Gooch, Terje.
###1526 Like, we were there for the fourth week in.
###1528 And they were like, it's just not happening.
###1530 We want to go home.
###1532 And I was just like--
###1533 I almost broke down in tears.
###1534 I was like, you guys can't leave.
###1535 We're so close.
###1536 We have a helicopter.
###1538 I had to convince those guys to stay.
###1540 Because I mean, we were all completely burnt down on being
###1542 in one place, snowboarding in the summertime.
###1547 So they stuck it out.
###1549 And we ended up--
###1552 the weather finally cleared and we got good shots.
###1554 So it was worth putting in the extra two weeks for.
###1558 But it's hard traveling and being in one
###1560 spot for that long.
###1563 
###1572 -Man, I thought you said no one was going to be here.
###1575 -It's that red-headed snowboard kid.
###1578 -Isn't there snow somewhere?
###1580 -Yeah, there's some freshies on the super
###1581 jib in Tahoe, bro.
###1583 -Come on.
###1584 I got an idea.
###1585 
###1590 -Hey.
###1590 What's up, guys.
###1592 -Tomato, how are you?
###1593 -How you doing?
###1595 SHAUN WHITE: I was about 16 and we paired up to do a
###1598 movie, The White Album.
###1600 And it was awesome.
###1602 And it was just funny because he's just this kind of like--
###1606 I don't know how to describe his personality.
###1608 It's just one of a kind.
###1611 It's awesome because we'd be hanging out and
###1613 shooting the movie.
###1614 And I totally would forget the fact that he just
###1616 shreds on his own.
###1617 And he's a really talented snowboarder, especially back
###1620 in the day.
###1620 He had stories, but they were mostly, like, oh this is when
###1623 Farmer jumped out the window at this hotel.
###1627 Something like that, you know what I mean.
###1628 Just random, random things like that.
###1630 Because it was a wild time back then.
###1633 Because it was just a lot different than now.
###1636 So it was a humbling experience to have him working
###1639 on a project with me.
###1642 DAVE SEOANE: I came up with the idea of the Shaun White
###1644 album probably--
###1645 I wanted to do it the year before--
###1646 two years before it was even released.
###1648 And the reason for that is Shaun White came on the Tony
###1651 Hawk state park tours.
###1653 And you could just see him, in like a two week period of his
###1655 progression was just so much higher.
###1657 And his snowboarding was starting to pick up, and like,
###1660 this is the year.
###1662 Things are going to happen for this kid.
###1663 And it would be great to document it.
###1664 And I've known Shaun since he was probably like eight years
###1667 old, since he was a little kid.
###1668 And I've just watched him grow up and develop.
###1671 And his progression curve was way bigger
###1674 than anybody else's.
###1675 So that year we were going to do it.
###1678 And then there was like, he wasn't sure.
###1679 And then his brother wasn't sure.
###1680 And then Renee from Burton was like, no, Shaun's
###1683 not ready for it.
###1684 And Shaun won all these contests all year round.
###1687 And Renee and I just butted heads.
###1689 And I was so frustrated.
###1690 But it gave us time to set up for the next one.
###1693 And so it gave us more prep work.
###1695 Then everybody was completely in.
###1697 And Renee and I are now friends again.
###1699 So it's nice.
###1701 Oh, yeah, we used to totally get into verbal feuds all the
###1705 time on the phone.
###1707 But it's funny now.
###1708 We joke around about it.
###1710 But Shaun was 17 at the time.
###1712 And it just--
###1715 that was a really tough film because that one, he blew his
###1718 knee out twice.
###1719 And we thought for sure that was another one, like, OK.
###1725 And we're so far into this.
###1726 And I had committed everything to doing this.
###1729 But we just had to wait and see how his knee went.
###1731 And we went down and we all sat down with our negotiator,
###1735 Richard Woolcott.
###1736 And he said OK, this is the deal.
###1738 In two months, we shouldn't throw the towel in yet.
###1740 You should try and make the call in a month
###1742 and a half from now.
###1743 And we just waited out and he just snapped right back in.
###1746 And we ended up, we went to New Zealand for a month and it
###1753 worked out fine.
###1754 So it was John Gotgart, Sean Aaron was on that New Zealand
###1759 trip, and myself.
###1760 So it was pretty much the three of us shooting.
###1762 But mostly G and I, and a lot of G traveling.
###1767 SHAUN WHITE: It was fun.
###1768 It was really nice to be able to work with someone who had
###1770 their own vision.
###1771 Because he knew how the movie was going to play out way
###1774 before I did, and way before anyone else that was working
###1777 on it with us really thought.
###1779 So it was cool to see him kind of, go OK, well we
###1782 really need this shot.
###1783 Or, you know what?
###1784 This doesn't even matter.
###1785 Because it was a really heavy point my life because I had my
###1788 first actual injury, I felt.
###1791 I had to get surgery on my knee.
###1792 And we were going through all this drama.
###1794 And he just turned it into such a cool
###1796 thing for the movie.
###1797 So I was surprised.
###1798 Normally it's like, oh, movie's over.
###1800 Can't do anything.
###1800 But he's like, no, we can work it.
###1802 We can figure it out.
###1805 MIKE BASICH: His movies he's done are usually
###1806 pretty unique and--
###1809 he's done the Haakonsen one, and White's album.
###1813 I think he's the one for unique projects.
###1816 I never see him going in the business of making a movie
###1819 every year.
###1820 It's just something to really, if it's right, right recipe
###1824 for him, he dives into that project.
###1827 DAVE SEOANE: As far as future films, if there's something
###1831 that comes along that I'm completely inspired, that I
###1836 can see the beginning, middle, and end to do on a--
###1839 whether it's an athlete or a film, then
###1840 I'd like to do something.
###1841 But I don't really-- there's enough really good filmmakers.
###1844 And there's really a shortage of athletes who go out and
###1846 just, like, turn a film out.
###1850 But if something unique really comes about, I
###1852 definitely want to do it.
###1853 And I think that's the biggest thing.
###1855 And everything is like, unless you're passionate about it,
###1858 it's just going to be watered down.
###1859 And I've had projects where I wasn't really
###1862 passionate about it.
###1863 I felt like I just had to make a film because I did one the
###1864 year before.
###1865 And I did it.
###1865 And it was really watered down.
###1866 And it was just like, ugh.
###1867 It just takes all the fun out of it.
###1869 But The White Album, I was completely
###1871 passionate about it.
###1871 And it worked out really well.
###1873 And I'm really proud of that film.
###1875 That's like the one film I love showing people, like that
###1877 and the movie with Terje.
###1879 So those two films.
###1881
