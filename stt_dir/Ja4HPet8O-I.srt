\f0\fs24 \cf0 \'85and so I keep looking back,
you know I'm 60 years old and I look back


5
0:0:5,67 --> 0:0:9,94
"Jesus Christ those were the days" I don't
know how THOSE were the days because I was


6
0:0:9,94 --> 0:0:15,19
a pinhead then. And I've learned so many new
things now that I keep looking forward. And


7
0:0:15,19 --> 0:0:19,97
people begin to worry about their aging process
but they don't understand that you're picking


8
0:0:19,97 --> 0:0:24,429
up NEW bits and you can handle a situation\'85Would
you rather be 17 again? (audience: No way\'85)


9
0:0:24,429 --> 0:0:29,279
or would you want the value system of when
you were 17? See? You know what I mean, its


10
0:0:29,279 --> 0:0:34,26
not worth a shit. Now, it must be something
quite interesting as people keep looking back


11
0:0:34,26 --> 0:0:40,21
to their youth, how much they've really missed.
Or how little they've learned in time. What


12
0:0:40,21 --> 0:0:45,25
they've been doing is going around in a barrel,
you know what I mean? In a motorcycle continuously.


13
0:0:45,25 --> 0:0:50,59
And then they lost the ability to do that
and they went downhill and their income is


14
0:0:50,59 --> 0:0:55,469
less and they were invited to less social
affairs and back here they keep thinking about


15
0:0:55,469 --> 0:1:0,309
a motorcycle in the barrel, those were the
big days. So they get older and older and


16
0:1:0,309 --> 0:1:4,1
they can hardly ride a motorcycle now and
they're still over there\'85. I was telling


17
0:1:4,1 --> 0:1:10,28
some of the people here about my family, they
lived through the depression and they actually


18
0:1:10,28 --> 0:1:15,409
never did travel much and then once they went
to Atlantic City for three weeks. Boy, for


19
0:1:15,409 --> 0:1:22,24
twenty years thereafter, "did we ever tell
you about the time we went to Atlantic City"\'85.You


20
0:1:22,24 --> 0:1:25,74
know, there's nothing there but ocean, board
walk\'85they didn't do anything unusual. But


21
0:1:25,74 --> 0:1:30,32
they remember that and a lot of people in
scarcity remember that in the early days.


22
0:1:30,32 --> 0:1:36,9
But you meet kids today, 17, they've been
to Paris and England and France, y'know\'85"I


23
0:1:36,9 --> 0:1:40,97
was in California.." stuff like that. The
world is shrinking, people move around they


24
0:1:40,97 --> 0:1:48,409
drive across country, they go to Yellowstone
National Park many times and it doesn't mean


25
0:1:48,409 --> 0:1:52,61
anything. And how do you talk to people that
have locked on to that that have lived through


26
0:1:52,61 --> 0:1:55,39
the last depression. Are you, will you be
discriminating against them..you just say


27
0:1:55,39 --> 0:1:58,549
"I don't place much value on that kind of
conversation". You say "do you like honesty?"


28
0:1:58,549 --> 0:2:1,759
I would say "it's the only way to be"\'85"Then
I don't place any value on your conversation"


29
0:2:1,759 --> 0:2:10,47
People don't want honesty, what the hell's
honesty? Honesty would be the most offensive


30
0:2:10,47 --> 0:2:19,52
kind of behavior you can think of. Diogenes
found an honest man, the guy to tell him "you're


31
0:2:19,52 --> 0:2:22,25
never going to find anything resembling an
honest man". To be honest you'd have to know


32
0:2:22,25 --> 0:2:29,6
EVERYTHING about EVERYTHING, to be that certain.
You know if someone asked you to tell them


33
0:2:29,6 --> 0:2:32,97
the TRUTH, you say "I'm not that wise. I can
only tell you a little bit of what I know


34
0:2:32,97 --> 0:2:39,74
about a given subject". Some of you may not
understand that. No one can tell the truth.


35
0:2:39,74 --> 0:2:47,78
The truth would mean, that the judge in convicting
somebody was a victim of circumstances and


36
0:2:47,78 --> 0:2:53,14
he was very angry at the person who committed
the crime because his values had no bridge


37
0:2:53,14 --> 0:2:56,37
to understand the physical forces that caused
that person to commit that crime. Whereas,


38
0:2:56,37 --> 0:3:1,67
Clarence Darrow said that the man who commits
the crime is the same as any other man except


39
0:3:1,67 --> 0:3:4,77
the circumstances they were raised under were
different and it led them to that conclusion.


40
0:3:4,77 --> 0:3:11,55
He didn't get mad at people. And so, how do
you deal with all those things? And do you


41
0:3:11,55 --> 0:3:17,6
want to? Sometimes its better for you to collect
a lot of books, know a lot of things, learn


42
0:3:17,6 --> 0:3:22,59
a lot of things, as much as you can, and go
to areas where you can share SOME of those


43
0:3:22,59 --> 0:3:28,45
things on physical anthropology, you meet
with these people and then the physical anthropologist


44
0:3:28,45 --> 0:3:33,44
and you share what you can with them. And
you talk with electronics people about electronic


45
0:3:33,44 --> 0:3:37,85
subjects and engineers about engineering subjects.
But I find that if you deviate too much from


46
0:3:37,85 --> 0:3:42,99
the subject you lose contact. If you surpass
your friends in electronics then you can't


47
0:3:42,99 --> 0:3:48,46
visit them anymore. You find this, that the
people you were very close to 10 years ago.."I


48
0:3:48,46 --> 0:3:54,15
don't know what happened but I became a loner\'85"
What happens is that people are not that interesting


49
0:3:54,15 --> 0:4:2,71
to you any more. You don't place a value in
the subjects they cherish. I don't know what


50
0:4:2,71 --> 0:4:7,37
to say when someone says "come on over to
the house, it's my baby's birthday". "Well,


51
0:4:7,37 --> 0:4:12,41
put the baby in the other room and we'll sit
down and bullshit"..I used to say to my brother


52
0:4:12,41 --> 0:4:20,22
"come on over but leave the kids home". He
knew what I meant but he didn't like it. He


53
0:4:20,22 --> 0:4:28,83
didn't like it, do you understand what I mean?
How'd you get to be an uncle? What's an uncle?


54
0:4:28,83 --> 0:4:34,54
Is an uncle a thing where you get a blood
transfusion if you need it? Is an uncle any


55
0:4:34,54 --> 0:4:38,85
physical referential thing that can serve?
Just a victim of certain values, "this is


56
0:4:38,85 --> 0:4:43,86
my nephew"\'85well, maybe that person was
switched in the hospital, maybe you took the


57
0:4:43,86 --> 0:4:49,85
wrong kid home. Maybe it's NOT your nephew.
I don't even know if my kids are my kids,


58
0:4:49,85 --> 0:4:55,82
I really honestly don't know that. They may
be, they may not be, but it doesn't matter.


59
0:4:55,82 --> 0:5:6,7
You treat all kids\'85you don't have to worry
about that. I don't want Fresco stamped on


60
0:5:6,7 --> 0:5:16,4
the thumb. Besides my daughter doesn't have
Fresco..( ?) Doesn't serve, the idea (?) 


61
0:5:16,4 --> 0:5:20,47
Now Ford of course, he's a smart guy. You
buy a truck and you carry a label on the back,


62
0:5:20,47 --> 0:5:23,93
Ford. You're a living billboard for the Ford
Motor Company. I don't want his fuckin' name


63
0:5:23,93 --> 0:5:30,81
on it, I paid for that truck, I want Fresco's
great visions\'85or whatever the hell I've


64
0:5:30,81 --> 0:5:35,5
got to sell on the back of that truck. But
there are people that drive trucks with the


65
0:5:35,5 --> 0:5:40,6
names of companies. They are intruding, I
can send them a bill, because they have posted


66
0:5:40,6 --> 0:5:48,6
their name on my truck without asking\'85wouldn't
get anywhere. But, some people do that, they


67
0:5:48,6 --> 0:5:54,81
can't do it in architecture I don't think
they ever have a "Louis B. Schmidt Home".


68
0:5:54,81 --> 0:5:59,18
I don't think I've ever seen that. I've seen
buildings called Rockefeller Center, I've


69
0:5:59,18 --> 0:6:5,23
seen things like that. But if I buy the building,
you tear down the name, people can't find


70
0:6:5,23 --> 0:6:11,6
you anymore. So they buy a corporation and
sometimes they buy the name, it might be your


71
0:6:11,6 --> 0:6:13,76
company, John's company. And everybody knows
it and they buy a lot of stuff from that company.


72
0:6:13,76 --> 0:6:18,22
And some people when they buy you out they
don't want to change the name. And if somebody


73
0:6:18,22 --> 0:6:22,18
later finds out that John's company became
the most corrupt company in the world, they'd


74
0:6:22,18 --> 0:6:26,31
pull their friends away from you. You said
"but I'm no longer affiliated"..doesn't make


75
0:6:26,31 --> 0:6:31,36
any difference. Isn't that interesting. That's
the sad thing about people. And if you found


76
0:6:31,36 --> 0:6:35,56
out I've been married for 20 years and my
wife was a prostitute. The neighbors are not


77
0:6:35,56 --> 0:6:42,53
going to invite me over. I said "i didn't
know that". And so they have a certain set


78
0:6:42,53 --> 0:6:45,67
about those things, "they are bad people".
I don't even know how to wrestle with it,


79
0:6:45,67 --> 0:6:50,58
or even know where to begin. And is it worth
beginning? Alright, before i get on with the


80
0:6:50,58 --> 0:6:54,6
subject I want to talk about with you tonight
I just want to say that when I went back to


81
0:6:54,6 --> 0:6:59,38
New York and all the relatives came over,
my mother was about 80 years old, and I "poisoned"


82
0:6:59,38 --> 0:7:3,29
them; I hit them with thousands of different
values and their kids were there and my sister


83
0:7:3,29 --> 0:7:9,31
came out and said "don't you use that kind
of language in my home". So I said "well I


84
0:7:9,31 --> 0:7:15,12
can leave now" and all the relatives said
"No, it's a good idea for the kids to hear


85
0:7:15,12 --> 0:7:22,23
that.." and they voted her out. And she went
back into the kitchen and started to cook.


86
0:7:22,23 --> 0:7:27,61
But she was invited in, she wasn't kept out
of things. Now, no one turned and said "don't


87
0:7:27,61 --> 0:7:33,169
you have any respect for your sister?" I don't
even know what respect means. I say that the


88
0:7:33,169 --> 0:7:38,65
reason that I talk to you, my relatives like
this is cause I respect you. That's hard to


89
0:7:38,65 --> 0:7:43,85
understand. You know "Fuck that shit" to my
relatives and I say "I respect you, I don't


90
0:7:43,85 --> 0:7:49,36
conceal that, I must trust your ability to
handle this linguistic difference". So respect


91
0:7:49,36 --> 0:7:53,29
is the ability to say to somebody "I've got
bleeding piles" \'85I don't care about your


92
0:7:53,29 --> 0:7:56,82
piles, then why do you ask me how my floppy
eyelid was? Aren't you concerned about my


93
0:7:56,82 --> 0:8:1,889
health? \'85say, "well, I've got a headache".
People, that's all they wanted, give them


94
0:8:1,889 --> 0:8:7,77
an aspirin. Says I've got an infected ear\'85must
be very painful. But very few people walk


95
0:8:7,77 --> 0:8:14,59
around saying "I've got an infected asshole"..I
used to say years ago to my wife "I've got


96
0:8:14,59 --> 0:8:22,1
to take a shit" she said "don't tell me just
go do it"\'85And so she says "I'm going out


97
0:8:22,1 --> 0:8:26,639
to hang the laundry on the line" or "I'm going
out to get a quart of milk"\'85"we want to


98
0:8:26,639 --> 0:8:34,5
share all things" she says "but not that".
So you run into a lot of problems and I just


99
0:8:34,5 --> 0:8:38,46
want to briefly say this. It's the story of
driving the car to the garage and you say


100
0:8:38,46 --> 0:8:49,86
to the mechanic once in awhile (?) You talk
about everything and anything without (?)


101
0:8:49,86 --> 0:8:57,1
 


102
0:8:57,1 --> 0:9:1,18
You can't confront the judge and say "how
do you make that decision?" He's got a book


103
0:9:1,18 --> 0:9:5,29
in front of him that tells him what decision
to make. He's not interested in other concepts


104
0:9:5,29 --> 0:9:13,19
and ideas. You can't get up as the free American
thinker. They'll say I don't hold..that point


105
0:9:13,19 --> 0:9:17,14
of view I consider it obsolete. (audience:
 ?) Ah, now you're communicating. That's real


106
0:9:17,14 --> 0:9:24,98
semantics. You buy the guy, you buy the judge
or you put the congressman in there. You don't


107
0:9:24,98 --> 0:9:28,96
have to tell him every week what you want,
he knows what you want, cause he gets the


108
0:9:28,96 --> 0:9:38,21
check. If it stops coming he can't operate.
We're going to talk about biochemical conditioning


109
0:9:38,21 --> 0:9:45,63
and learning without experience. And theres
a possibility of that and it has nothing to


110
0:9:45,63 --> 0:9:49,64
do with the word experiments, or the dna.
It has to do with something like this. In


111
0:9:49,64 --> 0:9:56,99
the learning process of all organisms there
is an input device; you pick it up from your


112
0:9:56,99 --> 0:10:0,39
nose your eyes your ears your tongue, and
they all come into the brain and there are


113
0:10:0,39 --> 0:10:5,17
all kinds of cross associations. But if you
could impart information into people, if you


114
0:10:5,17 --> 0:10:9,89
could do this. Put two electrodes on the head
of the person and play information into the


115
0:10:9,89 --> 0:10:16,12
brain you will not have the cross associations.
You'll have a glass and you'll have milk and


116
0:10:16,12 --> 0:10:20,89
you'll have milk in the glass, but how come
it's put in the glass as a container and why


117
0:10:20,89 --> 0:10:26,29
you selected that will not be known. But if
you pipe that in, you'll have a file on milk,


118
0:10:26,29 --> 0:10:36,32
glass, drinking milk in glass and there will
be very little cross associations. Here's


119
0:10:36,32 --> 0:10:43,99
how you understand it, lets assume that due
to shock Ben lost his ability to walk. He


120
0:10:43,99 --> 0:10:50,5
just can't walk, he saw some horrible condition
and he's unable to walk. So we stick two electrodes


121
0:10:50,5 --> 0:10:55,93
into the muscle in the spinal area and we
play the walking cycle into his legs. They


122
0:10:55,93 --> 0:11:1,98
say "how is he walking"\'85.he says "believe
me I really don't know" and there he is walking.


123
0:11:1,98 --> 0:11:6,339
And a lot of people think because you can
walk that you know how you walk. Even people


124
0:11:6,339 --> 0:11:10,89
that can walk don't know how they walk. They
don't say "there's a discharge at\'85(etc.)"


125
0:11:10,89 --> 0:11:15,82
They don't know that, they don't know how
they walk. If you turn to a person and say


126
0:11:15,82 --> 0:11:26,85
"can you see? I've been blind for years" and
a person.."yeah, with my eyes". That's no


127
0:11:26,85 --> 0:11:35,52
fucking answer. People think I'm answering
questions. How do you learn to walk with crutches?


128
0:11:35,52 --> 0:11:42,18
He says "like this.." And even in books on
semantics there's no information. So the question


129
0:11:42,18 --> 0:11:50,33
is "what is learning?" Now, does a person
who can't do any weaving weave a blanket?


130
0:11:50,33 --> 0:11:56,63
If I connect an electrode to the hip and transmit
to the brain and nervous system and they start


131
0:11:56,63 --> 0:12:4,12
weaving, they're amazed, as amazed as you
are. And so you say "how do you do it?" Says


132
0:12:4,12 --> 0:12:6,47
"I don't know I've got some thing connected
to my head" and then you say "stop doing that,


133
0:12:6,47 --> 0:12:11,8
scratch my back" and the hands won't do that
if you're playing that loop. And if you play


134
0:12:11,8 --> 0:12:15,44
a walking loop and decide not to walk you
go right on walking. I don't know if you've


135
0:12:15,44 --> 0:12:18,959
ever had a high voltage thing put in your
hand\'85(?). In the early days, an electrician


136
0:12:18,959 --> 0:12:22,44
trying to see if something is alive would
go like that\'85if it was alive his hand would


137
0:12:22,44 --> 0:12:27,4
close on it, on a wire like that. And he'll
die and so if they do they'll hit it like


138
0:12:27,4 --> 0:12:33,62
that and reflexes the other way\'85 (?) And
if a guy is working on an electrical system


139
0:12:33,62 --> 0:12:41,91
and he's down on his knee and he makes contact
these muscles contract and I've seen a guy


140
0:12:41,91 --> 0:12:45,18
crack his head on the ceiling. He'd never
jump that high, 250 volts right up to the


141
0:12:45,18 --> 0:12:53,17
ceiling\'85clunk. Say "how'd you do that?"
He doesn't know how he did it. Alright, they


142
0:12:53,17 --> 0:12:59,58
don't know the difference between conditioning
which moves a muscle or a reflex, artificial


143
0:12:59,58 --> 0:13:6,31
reflex. Let's take a Frenchman who can't speak
English, let's assume we can do this\'85run


144
0:13:6,31 --> 0:13:13,89
an electrode to the brain and \'85(?) He doesn't
know what he's saying. Neither does a Frenchman.


145
0:13:13,89 --> 0:13:31,74
If you turn to a Frenchman and said "give
me a cup of coffee" in French\'85 said what


146
0:13:31,74 --> 0:13:40,13
do you mean by a cup of coffee? You know a
cup of coffee\'85doesn't know what that is


147
0:13:40,13 --> 0:13:46,79
either\'85(?) Alright when you learn to ski
you don't learn about how you learn to learn


148
0:13:46,79 --> 0:13:53,5
to ski. You just get on the skis and the guy
says "turn your toes in and lean when you're


149
0:13:53,5 --> 0:14:0,75
going downhill this way or that way, or you
want to turn, jump\'85" they give you the


150
0:14:0,75 --> 0:14:4,98
gross reflexes necessary for that. But if
they gave you a description of all the muscles


151
0:14:4,98 --> 0:14:14,61
involved in learning to ski; you gotta learn\'85
So I want to say something about the learning


152
0:14:14,61 --> 0:14:21,89
process. It is not so much that we really
learn but we're stimulated to simulate parallel


153
0:14:21,89 --> 0:14:27,1
verbal behavior and verbal behavior that others
require of us. Like if you hold up a dog a


154
0:14:27,1 --> 0:14:31,54
little while and feed it then put your hands
under it and feed it, pretty soon it gets


155
0:14:31,54 --> 0:14:39,72
up and you say to the dog "how do you do that?"
The dog doesn't say "well come on in the other


156
0:14:39,72 --> 0:14:42,8
room and I'll lay it out". Alright its the
same thing with love, hand holding, we don't


157
0:14:42,8 --> 0:14:47,33
know what it is, cause they never grabbed
us when we were young and conditioned us to


158
0:14:47,33 --> 0:14:50,39
a method of analyzing the kind of conditioning
that's being superimposed upon us. And the


159
0:14:50,39 --> 0:14:57,95
more books you read that are quite different
from the cultural views that are established


160
0:14:57,95 --> 0:15:3,18
something happens in your head. You get a
different kind of set. And so you hear different


161
0:15:3,18 --> 0:15:7,12
views and you reject it right away. You don't
get conditioned cause you hang out with a


162
0:15:7,12 --> 0:15:10,66
screening process. The stuff comes in and
bounces off. I'm sure you've read a lot of


163
0:15:10,66 --> 0:15:16,47
books and said "hogwash" and so\'85(?) You
know what I mean by developing a screening


164
0:15:16,47 --> 0:15:21,7
process? Alright so you can be conditioned
by certain people if they have the elements


165
0:15:21,7 --> 0:15:27,18
to condition you, and you can condition certain
people. And if you succeed in getting a guy


166
0:15:27,18 --> 0:15:32,63
to read Loeb or a gal to read Loeb and other
books and "Tyranny of Words" and many of the


167
0:15:32,63 --> 0:15:39,11
books that you like, it doesn't mean that
the rest of the mental set is going to be


168
0:15:39,11 --> 0:17:39,11
able to file it in the appropriate regions.
