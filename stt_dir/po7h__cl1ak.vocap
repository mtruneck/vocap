###15 CLEO LE-TAN: Oh my god.
###17 I'm a bit scared.
###20 Don't really like this smell.
###22 
###24 There's loads of things written.
###27 "The big pussy of her granny is being fucked by all the
###32 guys from France." "Fuck the police."
###38 Some people are coming.

###49 This May, the world watched as French President Nicolas
###52 Sarkozy, a small elf-like creature who dominated the
###56 country's political landscape the past five years, was
###59 finally defeated by Francois Hollande, a boring, floppy man
###63 from the rival Socialist Party.
###64 The election was dominated by a number of baffling European
###68 financial issues.
###69 Boring!
###71 But what wasn't discussed was a crisis that had been
###74 simmering for years in the Parisian suburbs--
###77 the same suburbs in which, seven years ago, two teenagers
###80 were tasered to death while running from the police.
###83 As retaliation, hundreds of residents from Parisian
###86 council estates started rioting, protesting against
###90 police and their lack of employment opportunities.
###93 Almost 3,000 rioters were arrested, five police officers
###96 lost their lives, and 60 others were wounded.
###99 Fast-forward to now, and the media has more or less
###103 forgotten about these areas and the people who live there.
###106 But every now and then, the French Vice Office would come
###109 across new rap artists from these suburbs whose angry
###112 music suggested that none of the problems in the suburbs
###115 had gone away.
###116 They were all still making music as aggressive as ever,
###119 just like the days when the suburbs
###121 were going up in flames.
###122 So we set out there to meet all these artists and some of
###126 their friends, and that is why this film is called--
###129 
###137 It's the worst candy floss I've ever seen.
###139 Hello, my name is Cleo.
###141 I grew up in Paris, but I still love all the tourist
###144 destinations like the Louvre, the Tuileries
###146 Gardens, the Concorde.
###149 I'd heard about areas like Clichy-sous-bois and Evry in
###152 the news, but I'd never actually explored them.
###156 So when Vice told me they wanted to do a story about the
###159 situation over there, I got excited and I called up my
###162 friend the director Romain Gavras for a bit of advice.
###166 Romain made his first videos in the suburbs years ago and
###169 put me in touch with a rapper called Byron, who said he
###172 would show me the world of underground French rap.
###175 So we went to meet him and he took us to his home in Clichy.

###279 
###282 CLEO LE-TAN: Byron told us that if we wanted to find out
###284 about the southern part of the suburbs, we should go and talk
###287 to the guys from La Comera, a rap group from Grigny, La
###291 Grande Borne.

###356 CLEO LE-TAN: I really want to talk to that other guy with
###358 the braids, but he seems a bit--
###360 he's a bit scary.
###361 [SPEAKING FRENCH]
###363 
###385 CLEO LE-TAN: I'm a bit scared, because he seemed a bit manic.
###387 Are you guys going to come with me in the car?
###389 Should I have accepted?
###391 Should I have gone for it?
###392 I don't know.
###394 Because he was driving like a maniac earlier on, wasn't he?
###398 [SPEAKING FRENCH]
###399 
###414 He smelt very strongly of--
###418 onion?
###419 And he kept like going over me and he was like, wait, hang
###422 on, I'll do that for you.
###423 And it was like a really raw, weird smell of onion.
###426 It wasn't like, oh my god, you stink.
###428 It was just weird.
###429 [SPEAKING FRENCH]
###431 
###445 CLEO LE-TAN: I think he quite liked me.
###447 I mean, he kept asking if we were going to hang out and
###449 stuff and when he was going to pick me up, et cetera, et
###451 cetera, which was a bit much.
###452 [SPEAKING FRENCH]
###453 
###465 CLEO LE-TAN: I don't fancy him.
###467 I think he's very nice, but that's it.
###470

###476 
###491 CLEO LE-TAN: I have no idea where we're going.
###492 He just said come, and so we're just following.
###495 I just love going to people's places.
###497 I look around everything.
###499 That's all I'm interested in doing.
###501 [SPEAKING FRENCH]
###502 
###506 There was a mattress against the wall.
###508 There were some leather couches.
###511 There was a massive screen.
###512 Behind that table was a pit-bull, and he's just
###514 sitting there the whole time.
###516 And whenever I watched him, he's just going like--
###519 [SPEAKING FRENCH]
###521 
###528 Smoked a bit of weed, had a bit of a drink, they rapped.
###531 They were basically blocking all the sofas, so
###533 nobody could sit down.
###535 [SPEAKING FRENCH]
###537 I was so pleased with my first day here.
###540 I learned how to drive, possibly had a few dates lined
###543 up with said driver, and met loads of new people.
###547 It was great.
###548 There's a lot going on here.
