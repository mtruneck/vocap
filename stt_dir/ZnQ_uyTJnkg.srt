1
0:0:4,383 --> 0:0:8,94
Nick, why are Kevin and Lindsey watching
tv when they should be ready for school?


2
0:0:8,94 --> 0:0:11,219
We just want to see
what's gonna happen next.


3
0:0:11,219 --> 0:0:12,498
What are you watching?


4
0:0:12,498 --> 0:0:15,555
Only the greatest show ever
for the love of Chubb.


5
0:0:15,555 --> 0:0:17,977
- Hey, I don't talk like that.


6
0:0:17,977 --> 0:0:20,48
- It's a reality show
starring Chubb rock.


7
0:0:20,48 --> 0:0:23,216
- Chubb has three tickets
to go on a Sinbad fun cruise,


8
0:0:23,216 --> 0:0:25,718
and his wife wants to turn it
into a family vacation,


9
0:0:25,718 --> 0:0:27,954
but Chubb wants to take
hot dog and dinky.


10
0:0:27,954 --> 0:0:31,124
- Mm-Hmm.


11
0:0:31,124 --> 0:0:32,91
- Hey.


12
0:0:32,91 --> 0:0:33,293
- [Together]
Hey. Hey, Gigi.


13
0:0:33,293 --> 0:0:36,95
- What is this,
an intervention?


14
0:0:36,95 --> 0:0:39,165
- Yes, and now that you're here,
we can begin.


15
0:0:39,165 --> 0:0:40,233
[Laughter]


16
0:0:40,233 --> 0:0:41,201
- Hey.


17
0:0:41,201 --> 0:0:45,405
- [Laughs] I'm just kidding.


18
0:0:45,405 --> 0:0:47,44
Apparently,
I've been missing out


19
0:0:47,44 --> 0:0:49,542
on the greatest show on tv.


20
0:0:49,542 --> 0:0:50,844
- <i>For the love of Chubb?</i>


21
0:0:50,844 --> 0:0:52,245
- Yeah.
- Ooh, I love that show.


22
0:0:52,245 --> 0:0:53,479
Y'all watching it?


23
0:0:53,479 --> 0:0:55,215
Okay,
can I borrow your black clutch?


24
0:0:55,215 --> 0:0:56,516
- Sure.


25
0:0:56,516 --> 0:0:57,55
Kevin, sweetheart.


26
0:0:57,55 --> 0:0:58,785
- Yep.


27
0:0:58,785 --> 0:1:1,12
- Can you go upstairs
and get my black clutch purse


28
0:1:1,12 --> 0:1:2,388
out of the chest?


29
0:1:2,388 --> 0:1:4,224
It's in
the upper left-hand drawer.


30
0:1:4,224 --> 0:1:5,558
- What's a clutch purse?


31
0:1:5,558 --> 0:1:7,293
- It's long and rectangular,


32
0:1:7,293 --> 0:1:9,62
looks like
a big leather envelope.


33
0:1:9,62 --> 0:1:10,129
- Got it.


34
0:1:10,129 --> 0:1:11,731
Lindsey, can you pause it
for a second?


35
0:1:11,731 --> 0:1:12,732
- Okay.
- Okay.


36
0:1:12,732 --> 0:1:14,33
- Hurry up, man.


37
0:1:14,33 --> 0:1:20,106
Chubb is about to break the news
to dinky.


38
0:1:20,106 --> 0:1:21,708
You're not gonna wait
on your brother?


39
0:1:21,708 --> 0:1:23,71
- Do you want to watch dinky cry
or not?


40
0:1:23,71 --> 0:1:24,944
- Yeah.


41
0:1:24,944 --> 0:1:26,813
- You know, Lindsey,
as much time as you spend


42
0:1:26,813 --> 0:1:29,449
watching this, you could make
your own reality show.


43
0:1:29,449 --> 0:1:31,5
- Well,
your family is very interesting.


44
0:1:31,5 --> 0:1:32,385
I'll give you that.


45
0:1:32,385 --> 0:1:34,354
Now, I don't know
if it's Chubb rock interesting,


46
0:1:34,354 --> 0:1:35,555
but it's interesting.


47
0:1:35,555 --> 0:1:36,756
- You know what?


48
0:1:36,756 --> 0:1:38,291
That's actually
a really good idea.


49
0:1:38,291 --> 0:1:40,727
I could become famous
the way Kim Kardashian did.


50
0:1:40,727 --> 0:1:42,629
- Over my dead body.


51
0:1:42,629 --> 0:1:44,43
- I meant by having
a reality show.


52
0:1:44,43 --> 0:1:47,33
- Oh,
and I was being sarcastic.


53
0:1:47,33 --> 0:1:50,77
- Baby, you're the one that told
me sarcasm doesn't work on kids.


54
0:1:50,77 --> 0:1:52,605
- I was being sarcastic.


55
0:1:52,605 --> 0:1:55,541
- Hey, didn't you tell me
sarcasm doesn't work on men?


56
0:1:55,541 --> 0:1:57,644
- I was being sarcastic.


57
0:1:57,644 --> 0:1:59,679
- [Together] Ohh.


58
0:1:59,679 --> 0:2:0,88
- Thank you.


59
0:2:0,88 --> 0:2:3,116
- We were being sarcastic.


60
0:2:3,116 --> 0:2:5,251
[Laughter]


61
0:2:5,251 --> 0:2:8,955
- Okay,


62
0:2:8,955 --> 0:2:11,157
black and looks like
an envelope.


63
0:2:11,157 --> 0:2:14,694
This must be it.


64
0:2:14,694 --> 0:2:18,398
Hey, case.


65
0:2:18,398 --> 0:2:19,565
What?


66
0:2:19,565 --> 0:2:20,767
You want me to open you up?


67
0:2:20,767 --> 0:2:22,769
But you don't belong to me.


68
0:2:22,769 --> 0:2:23,87
I can't do that.


69
0:2:23,87 --> 0:2:26,272
It would be wrong.


70
0:2:26,272 --> 0:2:28,207
Oh, what is it?


71
0:2:28,207 --> 0:2:29,409
Oh, fine.


72
0:2:29,409 --> 0:2:30,643
You got me, okay?


73
0:2:30,643 --> 0:2:43,99
I'll open you up,
but then I really got to go.


74
0:2:43,99 --> 0:2:46,526
You didn't tell me you had a gun.

0:2:58,671 --> 0:3:1,14
- Mmm, good morning.


80
0:3:1,14 --> 0:3:2,608
- Hey.
- Hello.


81
0:3:2,608 --> 0:3:4,877
- I had a dirty dream about you.


82
0:3:4,877 --> 0:3:7,146
- Mmm, what was it about?


83
0:3:7,146 --> 0:3:10,783
- Well, I could show you better
than I can tell you.


84
0:3:10,783 --> 0:3:12,719
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
let me go brush my teeth.


85
0:3:12,719 --> 0:3:15,121
[Screams]


86
0:3:15,121 --> 0:3:17,857
Lindsey, get out of my bedroom.


87
0:3:17,857 --> 0:3:20,66
- Fine, I spend a half an hour
filming you two sleeping,


88
0:3:20,66 --> 0:3:23,96
and you kick me out just when
it starts to get interesting?


89
0:3:23,96 --> 0:3:24,931
- Do you know what
would be interesting?


90
0:3:24,931 --> 0:3:26,566
Filming me kicking your butt.


91
0:3:26,566 --> 0:3:38,211
Get out now.


92
0:3:38,211 --> 0:3:41,981
Lindsey, you can't really
be shooting a reality show.


93
0:3:41,981 --> 0:3:43,216
- Yes, I can.


94
0:3:43,216 --> 0:3:44,884
I borrowed a bunch of different
cameras from my friends.


95
0:3:44,884 --> 0:3:46,285
They're set up
all around the house.


96
0:3:46,285 --> 0:3:47,954
Some are in the dining room,
others in the living room.


97
0:3:47,954 --> 0:3:49,956
One is in the kitchen.
One is in the family room.


98
0:3:49,956 --> 0:3:52,125
- Lindsey, I've been
on the Internet once before.


99
0:3:52,125 --> 0:3:54,56
I don't want to do it again.


100
0:3:54,56 --> 0:3:56,763
- Mom,
this time it's different.


101
0:3:56,763 --> 0:3:58,264
- Is that a video?
- Yes.


102
0:3:58,264 --> 0:3:59,832
- Are you gonna post it
on the Internet?


103
0:3:59,832 --> 0:4:1,434
- Yes.
- Then it isn't any different.


104
0:4:1,434 --> 0:4:3,202
Now, stop filming me,
go to school,


105
0:4:3,202 --> 0:4:11,644
and when you get there,
look up "sarcasm."


106
0:4:11,644 --> 0:4:13,112
- Come on.
- Hurry up.


107
0:4:13,112 --> 0:4:14,447
You're not supposed
to be in here,


108
0:4:14,447 --> 0:4:16,449
so I know I'm not supposed
to be in here.


109
0:4:16,449 --> 0:4:22,188
- All right, close your eyes.


110
0:4:22,188 --> 0:4:25,792
All right...


111
0:4:25,792 --> 0:4:28,895
Open.


112
0:4:28,895 --> 0:4:31,364
- Dude.


113
0:4:31,364 --> 0:4:37,103
- Troy.


114
0:4:37,103 --> 0:4:39,105
- What is wrong with you, man?


115
0:4:39,105 --> 0:4:40,406
Put that thing down.


116
0:4:40,406 --> 0:4:43,76
- It's not loaded.


117
0:4:43,76 --> 0:4:44,477
- I don't care.


118
0:4:44,477 --> 0:4:45,845
You don't point a gun
at anything


119
0:4:45,845 --> 0:4:47,8
you don't plan to shoot.


120
0:4:47,8 --> 0:4:48,948
- Okay,
it's pointed at the floor.


121
0:4:48,948 --> 0:4:51,317
- I know,
and if the floor could hide,


122
0:4:51,317 --> 0:4:52,718
it would be back here with me.


123
0:4:52,718 --> 0:4:54,12
- All right, chill, dude.


124
0:4:54,12 --> 0:4:56,355
I'll put it down.


125
0:4:56,355 --> 0:4:58,891
[Gun clicks]


126
0:4:58,891 --> 0:5:0,26
What?


127
0:5:0,26 --> 0:5:1,594
Why are you so scared?


128
0:5:1,594 --> 0:5:4,97
- Because I know how this story
is gonna end,


129
0:5:4,97 --> 0:5:6,966
and I don't want to be on the
news as your "tragic friend,"


130
0:5:6,966 --> 0:5:9,235
everybody saying how
I was a good kid


131
0:5:9,235 --> 0:5:11,437
and how I had a bright future


132
0:5:11,437 --> 0:5:13,106
and how I wanted to be
an astronaut,


133
0:5:13,106 --> 0:5:15,341
and then you shot me.


134
0:5:15,341 --> 0:5:17,143
- I didn't know you wanted
to be an astronaut.


135
0:5:17,143 --> 0:5:19,212
- I don't,
but I want to have the option.


136
0:5:19,212 --> 0:5:21,13
- Okay,
I'm not gonna shoot you.


137
0:5:21,13 --> 0:5:24,851
- You know the most common thing
said before somebody's shot?


138
0:5:24,851 --> 0:5:26,419
"I'm not gonna shoot you."


139
0:5:26,419 --> 0:5:28,521
- All right, I think I'd know
if I wanted to shoot you.


140
0:5:28,521 --> 0:5:30,289
- Wanting to shoot me
and shooting me


141
0:5:30,289 --> 0:5:32,191
are two completely
different things.


142
0:5:32,191 --> 0:5:33,559
You don't know what you know.


143
0:5:33,559 --> 0:5:35,728
You didn't know I wanted
to be an astronaut.


144
0:5:35,728 --> 0:5:37,23
- I just wanted you to see it.


145
0:5:37,23 --> 0:5:38,464
- I've seen it.


146
0:5:38,464 --> 0:5:39,599
Now, do me a favor,


147
0:5:39,599 --> 0:5:53,97
and don't touch it
till I'm gone.


148
0:5:53,97 --> 0:5:55,733
- So, dad,
have you ever been in a gang?


149
0:5:55,733 --> 0:5:58,569
- Well, we were more
of a dance group than a gang.


150
0:5:58,569 --> 0:6:0,104
We were called
the Partyup Boys.


151
0:6:0,104 --> 0:6:1,405
We loved Prince.


152
0:6:1,405 --> 0:6:3,441
We'd perm our hair,
put on eyeliner,


153
0:6:3,441 --> 0:6:4,542
and wear tight pants.


154
0:6:4,542 --> 0:6:7,345
- You had hair?


155
0:6:7,345 --> 0:6:8,446
- That's funny.


156
0:6:8,446 --> 0:6:10,748
I was in a group,
and we did the same thing.


157
0:6:10,748 --> 0:6:12,683
- Do you have pictures?
- No.


158
0:6:12,683 --> 0:6:14,385
- So, dad, you never had to,
you know,


159
0:6:14,385 --> 0:6:17,21
ride up on some fools,
you know.


160
0:6:17,21 --> 0:6:19,957
- And do what,
challenge them to a split?


161
0:6:19,957 --> 0:6:21,626
What kind of questions
are these, anyway?


162
0:6:21,626 --> 0:6:23,127
- I saw <i>Boyz 'n the hood.</i>


163
0:6:23,127 --> 0:6:24,896
- Where'd you see
<i>Boyz 'n the hood?</i>


164
0:6:24,896 --> 0:6:26,63
- I downloaded it.


165
0:6:26,63 --> 0:6:27,632
- Hey, man, that's stealing.


166
0:6:27,632 --> 0:6:28,866
- No, it's not.


167
0:6:28,866 --> 0:6:30,968
- Tell that to Cuba Gooding Jr.
when he comes over here


168
0:6:30,968 --> 0:6:32,403
looking for his money.


169
0:6:32,403 --> 0:6:34,171
- Well, you've got my back,
though, right?


170
0:6:34,171 --> 0:6:35,74
- Right.


171
0:6:35,74 --> 0:6:39,377
- So, Lindsey, you're really
going through with this?


172
0:6:39,377 --> 0:6:41,546
- I want to,
but I looked at the footage


173
0:6:41,546 --> 0:6:43,614
that I shot so far,
and it's so boring.


174
0:6:43,614 --> 0:6:45,716
I even set up a confessional
for us to talk about


175
0:6:45,716 --> 0:6:46,851
what's going on in the house.


176
0:6:46,851 --> 0:6:48,786
- Confessionals are supposed
to be private.


177
0:6:48,786 --> 0:6:52,323
- It was private enough
for Kevin to moon the camera.


178
0:6:52,323 --> 0:6:56,627
- Kevin, you had your behind out
in a room where we eat?


179
0:6:56,627 --> 0:6:57,828
That's disgusting.


180
0:6:57,828 --> 0:6:59,96
- But funny.


181
0:6:59,96 --> 0:7:2,99
- Baby, everything you see
on those shows is staged.


182
0:7:2,99 --> 0:7:4,35
Do you know how long
it would take you to film a show


183
0:7:4,35 --> 0:7:6,3
if you just followed somebody
with a camera?


184
0:7:6,3 --> 0:7:7,305
- Not really.


185
0:7:7,305 --> 0:7:12,41
- Watch c-span.


186
0:7:12,41 --> 0:7:14,979
- It's day two
of <i>the Kingston-persons project.</i>


187
0:7:14,979 --> 0:7:16,581
Although we got off
to a slow start,


188
0:7:16,581 --> 0:7:18,416
I believe things will start
heating up soon.


189
0:7:18,416 --> 0:7:20,451
[Doorbell rings]


190
0:7:20,451 --> 0:7:24,555
Let's see who that is.


191
0:7:24,555 --> 0:7:26,891
- Hey.


192
0:7:26,891 --> 0:7:27,925
You look fabulous.


193
0:7:27,925 --> 0:7:29,293
- You look gorgeous.
- Thank you.


194
0:7:29,293 --> 0:7:31,95
- Ooooh-whee.


195
0:7:31,95 --> 0:7:32,964
Where are you going again?


196
0:7:32,964 --> 0:7:34,699
I don't know if I want you
leaving this house


197
0:7:34,699 --> 0:7:35,866
looking like that without me.


198
0:7:35,866 --> 0:7:36,901
- Oh, honey.


199
0:7:36,901 --> 0:7:38,302
- Look at you.


200
0:7:38,302 --> 0:7:40,371
- Yes, look, but don't touch.


201
0:7:40,371 --> 0:7:41,505
- Oh, trust me.


202
0:7:41,505 --> 0:7:42,773
The day I try to hit
on you again...


203
0:7:42,773 --> 0:7:45,643
- Is the day you get
shot down again.


204
0:7:45,643 --> 0:7:46,911
- What kind of party is this?


205
0:7:46,911 --> 0:7:48,212
- It's a black party.


206
0:7:48,212 --> 0:7:50,114
- That's why I wasn't invited.


207
0:7:50,114 --> 0:7:52,55
- Man, it's when everybody
is wearing black,


208
0:7:52,55 --> 0:7:55,987
although not quite as well
as me.


209
0:7:55,987 --> 0:7:57,955
- It's the first time
since the recession hit


210
0:7:57,955 --> 0:7:59,724
that the company
is in the black.


211
0:7:59,724 --> 0:8:1,626
- Oh, when you come home,


212
0:8:1,626 --> 0:8:3,828
we're gonna have to have
a little after party,


213
0:8:3,828 --> 0:8:5,997
a little whipped cream.


214
0:8:5,997 --> 0:8:8,132
- Hey, hey,
what's with the camera?


215
0:8:8,132 --> 0:8:10,534
- Oh,
I'm making a reality show:


216
0:8:10,534 --> 0:8:12,269
<i>The Kingston-persons project.</i>


217
0:8:12,269 --> 0:8:14,972
I did some research and found
out before I can post anything,


218
0:8:14,972 --> 0:8:17,8
I need you guys to sign
these release forms.


219
0:8:17,8 --> 0:8:18,943
- Where did you find
release forms?


220
0:8:18,943 --> 0:8:21,212
- Ah, you can get them
on the Internet.


221
0:8:21,212 --> 0:8:23,47
- Why do you need release forms?


222
0:8:23,47 --> 0:8:24,181
- You've got to protect yourself


223
0:8:24,181 --> 0:8:25,883
before you
wrickity-wreck yourself.


224
0:8:25,883 --> 0:8:30,87
As a rule, I don't do anything
without video consent.


225
0:8:30,87 --> 0:8:32,723
- So does this mean you guys
will sign the forms?


226
0:8:32,723 --> 0:8:35,993
[All speaking simultaneously]


227
0:8:35,993 --> 0:8:37,962
- You guys, come back.
I need you guys to sign this.


228
0:8:37,962 --> 0:8:43,901
Wait, come...Okay.


229
0:8:43,901 --> 0:8:47,238
- Oh, what kind of gun is that?


230
0:8:47,238 --> 0:8:48,739
- How am I supposed to know?


231
0:8:48,739 --> 0:8:51,876
- I don't know; It just seems
like something you would know.


232
0:8:51,876 --> 0:8:54,45
Hey,
you ever been in a shoot-out?


233
0:8:54,45 --> 0:8:58,282
- I grew up in Washington state,
not Washington, D.C.


234
0:8:58,282 --> 0:8:59,684
Why would I be in a shoot-out?


235
0:8:59,684 --> 0:9:0,885
- I don't know.


236
0:9:0,885 --> 0:9:3,87
Maybe you have, like,
a secret past or something.


237
0:9:3,87 --> 0:9:6,9
- I do not have a secret past,
and even if I did,


238
0:9:6,9 --> 0:9:9,527
I didn't shoot anybody
while I was in it.


239
0:9:9,527 --> 0:9:11,729
- Ohhh,
look at all those bullets.


240
0:9:11,729 --> 0:9:12,897
You see that?


241
0:9:12,897 --> 0:9:14,31
- Yeah, it's a movie.


242
0:9:14,31 --> 0:9:15,166
- Whoa...


243
0:9:15,166 --> 0:9:19,36
[Imitates gun firing]


244
0:9:19,36 --> 0:9:21,872
- Man, don't...


245
0:9:21,872 --> 0:9:23,908
Hey, how was the party?


246
0:9:23,908 --> 0:9:27,778
- Oh, let's just say I hope
they're still in the black.


247
0:9:27,778 --> 0:9:29,814
Babe,
they had everything there:


248
0:9:29,814 --> 0:9:32,65
Champagne, caviar,
steak, shrimp.


249
0:9:32,65 --> 0:9:34,485
I'm surprised I still fit
in this dress.


250
0:9:34,485 --> 0:9:35,486
- Me too.


251
0:9:35,486 --> 0:9:36,687
- How about you?


252
0:9:36,687 --> 0:9:37,988
You land any big fish?


253
0:9:37,988 --> 0:9:41,225
- No, and I hate it when a good
black dress goes to waste.


254
0:9:41,225 --> 0:9:42,993
- Aww, well,
why don't you and that dress


255
0:9:42,993 --> 0:9:44,328
go stand at the airport?


256
0:9:44,328 --> 0:9:46,23
I'm sure someone will offer
to take you on a trip.


257
0:9:46,23 --> 0:9:49,734
- If you're just gonna mock me,
good night.


258
0:9:49,734 --> 0:9:51,168
Thank you for the purse.


259
0:9:51,168 --> 0:9:52,69
I made it work.


260
0:9:52,69 --> 0:9:56,841
- Not that well.
You're here.


261
0:9:56,841 --> 0:9:58,175
- I'm gonna go head up to bed.


262
0:9:58,175 --> 0:9:59,643
- I'll be up in a minute.
- Okay.


263
0:9:59,643 --> 0:10:2,613
- Don't go to sleep, okay?
- Okay.


264
0:10:2,613 --> 0:10:12,79
- Oh, and keep the heels on.


265
0:10:12,79 --> 0:10:15,526
Baby,
I know you feel funny about it,


266
0:10:15,526 --> 0:10:18,28
but I really think we ought
to give Lindsey some support


267
0:10:18,28 --> 0:10:19,463
with this reality thing.


268
0:10:19,463 --> 0:10:22,933
- Nick, I can't help it,
you know.


269
0:10:22,933 --> 0:10:24,935
It just makes me feel weird.


270
0:10:24,935 --> 0:10:26,103
- Well, you have to admit


271
0:10:26,103 --> 0:10:27,705
it's different
than being spied on.


272
0:10:27,705 --> 0:10:29,306
At least you know
you're being filmed.


273
0:10:29,306 --> 0:10:31,41
- I know,


274
0:10:31,41 --> 0:10:33,611
and I guess there's worse tapes
a girl could be making.


275
0:10:33,611 --> 0:10:36,647
- Hmm, you know that's right.


276
0:10:36,647 --> 0:10:38,315
- I better get going.


277
0:10:38,315 --> 0:10:41,85
We have to plan a wedding
for a couple in the nra.


278
0:10:41,85 --> 0:10:42,653
They want to release
a dozen doves


279
0:10:42,653 --> 0:10:44,889
after they say "I do"
and then shoot them.


280
0:10:44,889 --> 0:10:59,503
- [Laughs]


281
0:10:59,503 --> 0:11:1,305
- Nick.


282
0:11:1,305 --> 0:11:5,109
- Oh, what...


283
0:11:5,109 --> 0:11:7,511
- Nick.


284
0:11:7,511 --> 0:11:8,579
- What?


285
0:11:8,579 --> 0:11:11,916
- Somebody's been messing
with my gun.


286
0:11:11,916 --> 0:11:15,719
- It wasn't me.


287
0:11:15,719 --> 0:11:24,288
- Nick, come on out, baby.


288
0:11:24,288 --> 0:11:27,458
- So, dad, tell us, please,
what's going on?


289
0:11:27,458 --> 0:11:29,426
- Yeah, I've never been pulled
out of class before


290
0:11:29,426 --> 0:11:30,427
in the middle of school.


291
0:11:30,427 --> 0:11:31,428
That was awesome.


292
0:11:31,428 --> 0:11:33,43
- Kevin, Lindsey,


293
0:11:33,43 --> 0:11:36,867
will you come over here
and sit down, please?


294
0:11:36,867 --> 0:11:38,836
- What's going on?


295
0:11:38,836 --> 0:11:40,304
- I'm about to explain it
to you.


296
0:11:40,304 --> 0:11:42,473
Put that away.


297
0:11:42,473 --> 0:11:44,808
- Listen very carefully.


298
0:11:44,808 --> 0:11:47,11
I'm gonna ask the two of you
a question,


299
0:11:47,11 --> 0:11:50,247
and after I ask this question,
I don't want to hear any lies,


300
0:11:50,247 --> 0:11:52,783
no hemming, no hawing,
no jokes.


301
0:11:52,783 --> 0:11:54,251
Don't say "what?"


302
0:11:54,251 --> 0:11:55,419
Don't ask to go to the bathroom.


303
0:11:55,419 --> 0:11:56,82
Don't blink.


304
0:11:56,82 --> 0:11:58,155
Don't stutter.


305
0:11:58,155 --> 0:11:59,657
Now, to make this easier on you,


306
0:11:59,657 --> 0:12:1,225
I'm gonna tell you
what the answer is,


307
0:12:1,225 --> 0:12:2,326
because technically,


308
0:12:2,326 --> 0:12:4,194
there are only two
correct answers.


309
0:12:4,194 --> 0:12:7,197
One of them is "me,"
and the other one is "not me."


310
0:12:7,197 --> 0:12:8,599
Do you understand?


311
0:12:8,599 --> 0:12:11,969
- Is that the question?


312
0:12:11,969 --> 0:12:13,637
- I said no jokes.


313
0:12:13,637 --> 0:12:18,242
- Sorry.


314
0:12:18,242 --> 0:12:19,81
- Who's been messing
with my gun?


315
0:12:19,81 --> 0:12:21,645
- Not me.


316
0:12:21,645 --> 0:12:23,614
- What were my options again?


317
0:12:23,614 --> 0:12:26,984
- One minute,
I've got to get this.


318
0:12:26,984 --> 0:12:29,62
- Okay, before you tell me
how much trouble I'm in,


319
0:12:29,62 --> 0:12:31,889
I have to say,
I'm pretty shocked.


320
0:12:31,889 --> 0:12:32,923
- How are you shocked?


321
0:12:32,923 --> 0:12:34,591
- Because I thought the gun
was yours,


322
0:12:34,591 --> 0:12:35,592
not mom's.


323
0:12:35,592 --> 0:12:36,994
I feel pretty stupid.


324
0:12:36,994 --> 0:12:39,296
I've been asking the wrong
person questions all this time.


325
0:12:39,296 --> 0:12:40,864
- All what time?


326
0:12:40,864 --> 0:12:42,332
- When did you find it?


327
0:12:42,332 --> 0:12:43,5
- A few days ago.


328
0:12:43,5 --> 0:12:44,501
- What were you doing


329
0:12:44,501 --> 0:12:45,769
looking through my things?


330
0:12:45,769 --> 0:12:47,805
- You asked me to.
I was looking for that purse.


331
0:12:47,805 --> 0:12:50,4
- You did a little more
than look for a purse.


332
0:12:50,4 --> 0:12:51,475
- I plead the 12th.


333
0:12:51,475 --> 0:12:52,843
- What is the 12th?


334
0:12:52,843 --> 0:12:54,311
- I'm 12.


335
0:12:54,311 --> 0:12:56,513
You can't ask a 12-year-old
to go look through your stuff


336
0:12:56,513 --> 0:12:58,248
and expect him not to go look
through your stuff.


337
0:12:58,248 --> 0:13:2,186
- Kevin, not only are you
on the verge of being smacked,


338
0:13:2,186 --> 0:13:5,589
but you invaded my privacy,
and you could have gotten hurt.


339
0:13:5,589 --> 0:13:7,958
- Don't say "hurt."
Say "shot."


340
0:13:7,958 --> 0:13:10,561
Plaxico burress got hurt
because he got shot.


341
0:13:10,561 --> 0:13:12,262
- I only pointed it
at the floor.


342
0:13:12,262 --> 0:13:14,865
- You're not supposed
to be pointing it at anything.


343
0:13:14,865 --> 0:13:16,66
Do you get that?


344
0:13:16,66 --> 0:13:17,0
- Yes.


345
0:13:17,0 --> 0:13:19,136
- Did you take it to school?
- No.


346
0:13:19,136 --> 0:13:20,504
- Did you take it out
of the house?


347
0:13:20,504 --> 0:13:21,505
- No.


348
0:13:21,505 --> 0:13:22,906
- Did you take it out
of the bedroom?


349
0:13:22,906 --> 0:13:25,709
- I took it in my room.
- Did you show it to anyone?


350
0:13:25,709 --> 0:13:26,977
- I showed it to Troy.


351
0:13:26,977 --> 0:13:28,746
- Oh, Kevin.


352
0:13:28,746 --> 0:13:31,215
Man, guns are dangerous.


353
0:13:31,215 --> 0:13:33,83
They are made to kill people.


354
0:13:33,83 --> 0:13:37,54
Look, if you found a gun,
you ought to tell somebody.


355
0:13:37,54 --> 0:13:40,57
- It was in <i>your</i> drawer,
though.


356
0:13:40,57 --> 0:13:42,726
- I don't care if it was in
my back pocket.


357
0:13:42,726 --> 0:13:44,294
If it was,
you should have said,


358
0:13:44,294 --> 0:13:47,3
"hey, mom, do you know you have
a gun in your back pocket?"


359
0:13:47,3 --> 0:13:48,499
- If you find a picture
of a gun,


360
0:13:48,499 --> 0:13:49,666
you should say something.


361
0:13:49,666 --> 0:13:51,368
- If you're watching
the history Channel


362
0:13:51,368 --> 0:13:53,36
and the Nazis
are invading Poland


363
0:13:53,36 --> 0:13:55,572
and they have guns,
come and tell me.


364
0:13:55,572 --> 0:13:56,874
You understand?


365
0:13:56,874 --> 0:13:58,41
- Yes.


366
0:13:58,41 --> 0:13:59,576
Am I in trouble?


367
0:13:59,576 --> 0:14:2,212
- Kevin,
we're glad that you're safe,


368
0:14:2,212 --> 0:14:3,614
and it's partially my fault,


369
0:14:3,614 --> 0:14:6,183
because I should have made sure
that the case was locked.


370
0:14:6,183 --> 0:14:12,389
- No computer or video games
for one week.


371
0:14:12,389 --> 0:14:14,892
- Wow, that was amazing.


372
0:14:14,892 --> 0:14:16,293
Can you guys do that again


373
0:14:16,293 --> 0:14:18,695
so I can get it
on a better angle?


374
0:14:18,695 --> 0:14:31,575
- You do realize we have a gun.


375
0:14:31,575 --> 0:14:33,243
You think we did
the right thing today?


376
0:14:33,243 --> 0:14:36,513
- He's lucky he didn't
get grounded for a month.


377
0:14:36,513 --> 0:14:38,949
A week is getting off easy.


378
0:14:38,949 --> 0:14:40,117
- I'm just saying.


379
0:14:40,117 --> 0:14:42,52
I mean, he's being grounded
for something


380
0:14:42,52 --> 0:14:44,87
we never told him not to do.


381
0:14:44,87 --> 0:14:47,658
- Well, I never told him not
to jump off a 70-foot building


382
0:14:47,658 --> 0:14:49,226
or not to eat a spider,


383
0:14:49,226 --> 0:14:51,195
but somehow,
he figured that out.


384
0:14:51,195 --> 0:14:52,763
Nick,

T.I.'s life would be

this conversation with him?

taken it out on the street

Troy was over here,

Oh.

Oh, that's simply not possible.

Oh, Troy was volunteering
at the animal shelter

that wasn't the case.


449
