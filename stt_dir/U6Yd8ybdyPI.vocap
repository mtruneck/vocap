###10 RAY BARBEE: I mean, to me, honestly, I always looked at
###14 punk as more of a way of thinking, if you will.
###18 It's kind of more that part of you that's just like, man, I
###21 want to do this.
###23 This is the norm?
###24 I want to do that!
###25 If there's a heavy metal show and then they book a jazz band
###31 in there, that's punk.
###34 PATRICK O'DELL: Hi, welcome back.
###36 This episode is about Ray Barbee, who was actually the
###40 first pro board I ever had.
###42 I think, to me, he looked different.
###44 He just looks cool when he skates.
###46 And even back then, those old videos, I remember when Ban
###50 This came out, seeing his skating, and he would do a
###53 bunch of no complies and then a kick flip.
###55 And I'd think, like, wow!
###56 I can't believe he can do all those tricks in a row.
###60 It doesn't take him 10 tries to do each trick or whatever.
###63 And I sat down with Ray, and I asked him a little bit about
###65 filming for those old Powell videos.
###69 He's a really awesome skater.
###71 And this is it.
###72 The Ray Barbee episode.
###73 MALE SPEAKER 1: How long have you been skating?
###75 RAY BARBEE: Six years.
###77 MALE SPEAKER 1: When did you start?
###79 RAY BARBEE: Six years ago.
###81 When I first got into skateboarding, again, it was
###85 in between sixth and seventh grade.
###86 And I had a friend named Danny that I always hung out with.
###89 We rode bikes together all summer.
###92 And for his birthday he got a skateboard.
###94 And it was just like, whoa!
###96 It made such an impression on me.
###98 And he was riding that, and I was riding my bike, and I was
###100 like, man, I want to get a skateboard.
###103 He was like, well, my dad used to skate.
###104 Let me see if he has his old skateboard out in the garage.
###106 So, sure enough, we went in the garage and found it.
###109 It was a Sims wood kick.
###110 It was like a '70s board.
###112 There was a group of guys that were like, what did you guys
###116 do over the summer?
###117 And we were like, dude, we skateboarded.
###119 They were like, you skateboard?
###119 We skateboard, too.
###120 Come hang out with us.
###121 One of the guys, he had a quarter pipe.
###124 We started off there just learning tricks, like be in a
###126 line in the garage, hit it, come back, get in line, and
###130 then do that.
###131 Because of the ramps then, it was a lot of the vert pros
###136 that I would hear about.
###137 We knew that there was Caballero in San Jose.
###140 And these were all the guys that we were like, whoa, we
###144 want to be like--
###144 we want to rip like they do, kind of thing, you know?
###147 And it was crazy, because back then, it was so different.
###150 Nowadays kids are like, give me a board, give
###153 me a sticker, whatever.
###155 We were just like, whoa.
###156 We didn't want to bug him.
###157 We were like, whoa!
###160 We didn't want to say nothing to him.
###161 We were just like, let him do this thing.
###163 PATRICK O'DELL: Was Public Domain the first
###165 video you were in?
###166 RAY BARBEE: That was the first video, yeah.
###167 Well, you know what?
###168 I was in Sick Boys, but Public Domain was definitely the
###172 first featured thing of me, for sure.
###176 Yeah, it was called the Rubber Boys, that segment.
###178 And it was Steve Saiz, Chet Thomas, and Eric
###180 Sanderson and myself.
###182 Because of, for us, street was being so new,
###185 the list was blank.
###187 So for us, it was really exciting because it was like,
###189 whoa, we can just make up tricks.
###191 So we had a lot of fun just kind of stumbling across
###193 things and making up tricks.
###195 And I think a lot of the stuff that we stumbled on were
###201 things that people had never seen.
###203 Because street skating, I almost liken it to underground
###206 hip-hop or Indy music, where it's like it's own culture.
###210 It's doing things, but it takes something
###213 to bring it to light.
###214 But once that one thing gets brought to light, people think
###217 that that's the first time.
###218 But it was happening for so long in the--
###221 whatever you want to say.
###222 In its little culture and in its little scene.
###223 It'd been going on for years, but it was just a matter of it
###226 getting surfaced out.
###227 And that's when people always link it to that, but it was
###230 going on for a while.
###232 PATRICK O'DELL: And what was the process for filming then?
###235 It was just sort of like one day just skating around?
###238 RAY BARBEE: Three days total was that whole--
###240 all that footage was three days.
###242 And it's funny because Stacy wanted it to
###244 look like one day.
###245 So I remember, we'd skate--
###247 get going at 7:00 in the morning, be done
###249 at 8:00 at or whatever.
###252 And he'd want us to put on the same clothes the next day.
###254 And we did that for three days straight.
###256 Yeah, the same Levi's, and the same shirt, and the same
###259 shoes, maybe switch out the socks.
###261 PATRICK O'DELL: So then the next video is Ban This?
###264 RAY BARBEE: Ban This was right after Public Domain, yeah.
###266 PATRICK O'DELL: And I remember in that one
###267 you had lots of lines.
###269 It would be like seven tricks in a row.
###272 RAY BARBEE: Yeah.
###273 That was the first one with my own part.
###276 PATRICK O'DELL: When you decided what spots you were
###278 going to go to, did you decide?
###280 Or did Stacy decide?
###281 RAY BARBEE: That's what was cool for me.
###282 A lot of those spots were like the first time
###284 I ever skated them.
###285 Because we'd just get with Stacy and Stacy would just
###287 drive around and be like, you want to skate that?
###289 And I'd be like, cool.
###290 PATRICK O'DELL: It looked like some of the video was looking
###291 for scenery and not so much like--
###294 RAY BARBEE: It was before the days of where you'd find spots
###297 and film one thing.
###299 Back then, it was more like let's just capture the feel of
###302 what it's like to just go skating, go skating out in--
###305 so I could tell definitely around Ban This time, Stacy
###310 was getting more of an idea of what he wanted to do visually.
###313 So he would take me to spots, and I would be like, OK, you
###315 just want we to skate on the ground right here?
###316 And he's like, yeah.
###317 I'm like, OK.
###318 PATRICK O'DELL: Did you feel like then a part was about,
###319 like you said, expressing skating?
###322 Or did you ever feel--
###322 RAY BARBEE: It's hard to say because it's always easy to
###325 see what it grew into, and then look back, and then try
###329 to think did you feel like you wished it would
###332 have been like this?
###333 But it was way before any of that.
###335 So it was what it was.
###336 It was just being created.
###337 So there was no--
###339 the only goal was let's just be on our boards.
###343 And, OK, you're documenting it.
###345 But to me, the whole video thing was so new.
###349 I didn't know what was going to come of any of this.
###352 For street skating, back then, there weren't too many parts.
###355 Again, it was such new terrain, new area.
###359 I mean, I dig where it is now.
###361 There's a place for all of it.
###363 Because of the growth of it, the reality is the way
###366 skateboarding got pushed, it just got to a place to where
###369 you can't do that in three days.
###371 There's just no way to physically pull that off.
###373 It takes a long time because of where it's got pushed.
###377 So that's great.
###378 Because everything's got to get pushed, man.
###380 You can't stay still.
###381 Everything's got to keep moving
###382 and growing and growing.
###383
