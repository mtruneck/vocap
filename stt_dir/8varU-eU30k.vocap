###9 I'll knock your territorial army pussy all over the
###13 fucking town.
###14 Let's hook it up, get in the ring, bear.
###16 Bear versus cobra, let's get it fucking on.

###23 Hi, I'm Steve Ludwin, I'm here with Vice to respond to all
###26 the video comments to the documentary "Getting High with
###29 Snake Venom." First off, I'd like to say it's been really
###31 exciting, and the comments have been amazing and quite
###34 cathartic for me to read.
###35 Some are super intelligent and some are pretty super dumb.
###38 But, hey, I understand super dumb, so we're going to answer
###41 all the questions, hopefully, today.
###43 Here's one right here.
###44 It says, "How the fuck are you still alive?" If I ever had
###47 another accident with snake venom and I needed to go to
###50 the hospital, I wouldn't.
###51 And I've been in situations already where normal people
###54 would have gone to the hospital.
###56 I induced a heart attack, I've had some serious breathing
###59 problems, like paralysis on my lungs.
###61 And I actually thought to myself, don't go and waste
###64 hospital time.
###65 You've done this to yourself.
###66 Don't be a pussy, ride it out.
###69 Here's another one.
###69 "FUUUUUUUCK!
###71 Just look at him
###72 shaking." And I was.
###73 My hands, as I was milking the snakes--
###76 which are really dangerous snakes.
###78 I definitely didn't want to get bit live on camera.
###80 It was 9 o'clock in the morning, there was an
###83 ambulance outside, and there were two camera crew guys.
###86 The paramedics had to be there for health and safety.
###90 But yes, I was shaking.
###92 I was shaking like fuck.
###94 But I don't shake.
###95 Whoo, I am shaking there.
###97 "I can't help relate the process to a drug addiction.
###100 The glorification of injecting, the fear and
###102 excitement at the same time, all very reminiscent of a
###105 heroin addict." There's a lot of people saying that I'm
###108 addicted to venom, I'm an addict.
###110 That's not true.
###111 There's no way.
###112 It's not like a drug.
###113 I don't feel like, hey, I need some venom.
###116 Here's an interesting question.
###117 "Cool stuff.
###118 He's definitely some kind of freak super-human!
###121 Is there some type of Snake-Man super
###123 hero or action figure?
###125 If not, some comic illustrator should make him into a
###127 superhero."
###129 Well, I'd total be up for that.
###131 So Marvel, get in touch.
###133 The one strange thing that I have noticed, I get these
###137 incredible cravings, usually once a day now, for these.
###143 And I just sort of started thinking to myself, well, the
###146 snakes are eating these mice, so why can't I?
###150 It's good, it's protein and stuff.
###152 And I find that I can knock back quite a few mice.
###154 
###157 They're good.
###159 They're really good.
###160 They're healthy.
###163 They were sort of humanely killed.
###164 I think mice are the future.
###170 They taste like mice.
###172 "I bet his sperm tastes weird."
###175 I don't know how to answer that.
###176 I don't think it tastes weird at all.
###178 I think it tastes like pineapple juice.
###181 Here's one from grambo519.
###184 "Ever suck dick for snake venom?" No.
###187 I mean, yes.
###188 Is that a trick question?
###189 That's a trick question, right?
###190 Here's one from CatDonuts1234.
###193 CatDonuts, cool.
###195 "Awesome!
###196 He's 46?
###197 He looks 28."
###198 People don't believe me.
###199 I am 46 years old.
###201 I was born in 1966.
###203 What a year.
###204 I don't know, people ask, are there anti-aging properties to
###207 snake venom?
###208 And the answer is yes.
###210 There has been an anti-aging cream that's been on the
###212 market for the last six, seven years that celebrities are
###215 using that contains snake venom in it.
###218 It's a big seller.
###219 It's proven to work.
###220 So, does snake venom have anti-aging properties?
###223 Apparently so.
###224 "Isn't this also sort of animal abuse?"
###228 No, this isn't animal abuse at all.
###230 I'd like to defend that.
###231 None of the snakes are hurt.
###233 They're all kept in a naturalistic way.
###235 You saw a lot them were in those little containers--
###238 that was just to transport them into the
###240 room where I was milking.
###242 All the animals are well looked after.
###244 It is not animal abuse.
###246 Here's a question from Mat397.
###249 "Hey, Steve, is there a main goal you would like to achieve
###251 with doing snake venom injections?"
###253 I would like to take it further
###255 and research it properly--
###257 like I said in the documentary--
###259 with a forward-thinking company, open-minded company,
###262 and see if there is any medicinal value.
###264 That's what I'd like to achieve.
###266 "Could you make antivenom with his blood?"
###270 I think that's an interesting question.
###271 That's what I would like to research.
###273 I'd like to see if I have reached a level of immunity to
###277 the snake venom in my blood that can be used to help
###280 somebody else.
###281 We know that that's possible because Bill Haast has
###283 already done it.
###284 But I would like to see at what level my blood could be
###287 used to make an antivenom, or to fight anything off, for
###291 that matter.
###292 "Steve, have you experimented with any venom from animals
###295 other than snakes?"
###297 No, I haven't yet.
###298 But I think it is really amazing that the possibilities
###301 of doing so in the future.
###302 There are millions of undiscovered
###304 compounds in all venoms.
###306 It's not just snake venom.
###307 There's sea anemones, there's cone shells, there's
###311 everything.
###311 All the venomous animals on the planet, I think their
###314 venom should be studied.
###315 What can kill you can also save you.
###318 One of the really alarming things about this
###320 documentary--
###321 and I suppose I kind of knew that it was going to happen--
###325 was the alarming amount of people that were saying, this
###328 is cool, I'm going to try this.
###330 I definitely, definitely don't want anyone to try it.
###334 I don't think you should.
###335 Like I said, I have over 25 years of experience working
###338 with venomous snakes.
###340 People are asking, what snakes do you use?
###342 This isn't a cooking show.
###343 There's no recipe here, OK?
###345 So don't fuck up, because you will be underground.
###348 And I don't want it to be someone who was
###349 influenced by me.
###351 All right, guys.
###352 Thanks a lot.
###353 Thanks a lot for watching, thanks a lot for sending in
###356 all your questions.
###356 This has been Steve Ludwin and Vice.
###359 And what else can I say?
###361 One last thing--
###362 don't be a dickhammer.
###365
