1
0:0:0,89 --> 0:0:5,589
kimberly out chair who works at a law
firm and alex texas claims that out her


2
0:0:5,589 --> 0:0:10,719
bosses happy snow fraternization
fraternization policy


3
0:0:10,719 --> 0:0:13,779
of course states that you're not allowed
to have a sexual relationship with your


4
0:0:13,779 --> 0:0:18,719
peers at work and this our policy
actually extends to outside of the


5
0:0:18,719 --> 0:0:23,79
workplace and she claims that as a
result no one wants to hang out with her


6
0:0:23,79 --> 0:0:27,529
her mail appears the male lawyers do not
want to hang out with their so according


7
0:0:27,529 --> 0:0:31,509
to our lawsuit they created a segregated
culture that process a call to the


8
0:0:31,509 --> 0:0:34,46
denies female attorneys the same
opportunities for business


9
0:0:34,46 --> 0:0:39,67
and for raises as their male colleagues
and hurts their ability to work so dave


10
0:0:39,67 --> 0:0:42,26
what do you think about this the first
uh... you know we were uh... would you


11
0:0:42,26 --> 0:0:45,86
can send me the story cases from so i'm
back on and i have to read the headline


12
0:0:45,86 --> 0:0:50,41
of what the headline exactly lawsuit
alleges texas employer barred men and


13
0:0:50,41 --> 0:0:51,23
women


14
0:0:51,23 --> 0:0:52,86
from being alone together


15
0:0:52,86 --> 0:0:57,79
it sounds like onion like it does sound
like the idea method and women should


16
0:0:57,79 --> 0:1:1,1
not to be alone together because if you
put them now


17
0:1:1,1 --> 0:1:1,939
and a woman


18
0:1:1,939 --> 0:1:6,79
in an office and you close that door
it's not all my god the chances that


19
0:1:6,79 --> 0:1:8,78
they won't be banging each other in ten
seconds


20
0:1:8,78 --> 0:1:9,53
persona


21
0:1:9,53 --> 0:1:12,3
i mean this is hold completely


22
0:1:12,3 --> 0:1:15,9
insane it's really on


23
0:1:15,9 --> 0:1:18,619
so chris ryan who's the author of sex it
don had a really great out conversation


24
0:1:18,619 --> 0:1:23,0
with me about this for the point which
is on you tube dot com slash fax counts


25
0:1:23,0 --> 0:1:24,34
where you guys to check that out


26
0:1:24,34 --> 0:1:27,799
and he was making the argument that when
it comes to workplace relationships and


27
0:1:27,799 --> 0:1:30,849
workplace romance is it's one of those
things where you have to


28
0:1:30,849 --> 0:1:35,27
tolerated and accepted in order to
control it so do workplace romances


29
0:1:35,27 --> 0:1:40,149
happen uh... dot all the time isn't
necessarily a good thing in some cases


30
0:1:40,149 --> 0:1:40,929
it's not


31
0:1:40,929 --> 0:1:44,46
but i think that this is you make it
tougher big difference


32
0:1:44,46 --> 0:1:48,99
and people are gonna wanna get together
and they're gonna wanna become sexual do


33
0:1:48,99 --> 0:1:52,14
you know what i have sex on the buses
that stuff is going to have buried never


34
0:1:52,14 --> 0:1:55,52
been a group of more sexually repressed
people live here in this office and when


35
0:1:55,52 --> 0:2:0,159
you do that it's brutal ground for crazy
things it's fertile ground for them to


36
0:2:0,159 --> 0:2:2,13
have sex behind the water cooler


37
0:2:2,13 --> 0:2:5,86
and to go through the inflating the
sexual partner right


38
0:2:5,86 --> 0:2:9,509
that this atmosphere that you can create
in this environment in that what can you


39
0:2:9,509 --> 0:2:13,97
imagine working in a place where if you
felt you had to quote will keep the door


40
0:2:13,97 --> 0:2:16,12
open at all times if you were with the
man


41
0:2:16,12 --> 0:2:20,64
it just couldn't believe renault
increases in insurance can't be good


42
0:2:20,64 --> 0:2:24,73
for the productivity during the day
right absolutely i think it's a terrible


43
0:2:24,73 --> 0:2:28,91
idea obviously other another thing that
you know i kinda wanna discuss is


44
0:2:28,91 --> 0:2:33,13
how we can actually hinder someone's
upward mobility because


45
0:2:33,13 --> 0:2:38,63
let's say you're data a male in a female
dominant uh... workplace right out what


46
0:2:38,63 --> 0:2:42,75
happens if all those women get together
outside the workplace ni socialize and


47
0:2:42,75 --> 0:2:46,23
they have you know close relationships
they're probably more willing to look


48
0:2:46,23 --> 0:2:49,76
out for one another because they have a
personal relationship with one another


49
0:2:49,76 --> 0:2:54,8
head and i think that's what this female
attorneys experiencing at this firm by


50
0:2:54,8 --> 0:2:57,179
the way the law firm is uh... schieffer
in stone


51
0:2:57,179 --> 0:3:1,459
uh... on-site sheep in stone an anxious
she's saying that after work she wants


52
0:3:1,459 --> 0:3:4,919
to go grab a drink with the guys and the
guy who do not want to hang out with her


53
0:3:4,919 --> 0:3:8,429
because they're so worried about this
policy and you know this is missus


54
0:3:8,429 --> 0:3:11,389
reject because this is what women have
been saying about the golf course for


55
0:3:11,389 --> 0:3:13,909
many years that menard all got together


56
0:3:13,909 --> 0:3:17,409
and usually the women don't do that
although there actually are when u print


57
0:3:17,409 --> 0:3:18,41
winning oscars


58
0:3:18,41 --> 0:3:19,34
uh...


59
0:3:19,34 --> 0:3:23,89
that then they're gonna be cutting deals
on the gulf was when women are so the


60
0:3:23,89 --> 0:3:26,349
it's just crazy numerous separating


61
0:3:26,349 --> 0:3:29,95
the sex is this is twenty thirteen
america and might i add if i happen to


62
0:3:29,95 --> 0:3:30,59
get


63
0:3:30,59 --> 0:3:33,44
the gate and go to this and so then what
happens if


64
0:3:33,44 --> 0:3:37,76
give to game and they're allowed to
close the door but the uh... the man in


65
0:3:37,76 --> 0:5:37,76
the woman with the we have no so that is
actually pro-gay still
