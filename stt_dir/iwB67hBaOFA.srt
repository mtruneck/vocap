This episode is the mild ride,

0:0:55,16 --> 0:0:56,76

just going to stop.

turn to the right.

going to turn.

is a mature skate tour.

yeah, in all ways.

mean totally awesome, then

I don't know, it's been
really silly.

These things are
kind of silly.

up a little bit.

0:2:55,76 --> 0:2:59,35
But I think they kind of
have to expect that.


63

If you're lending out like a
group of Vespas to a group of

maybe somewhat expected.

skaters.

video came out, I was


85
0:4:11,1 --> 0:4:15,55
like 14, 15, so yeah,
he is kind of--


86
0:4:15,55 --> 0:4:16,829
he is Ethan Fowler.

was like ranting and

had a couple road pops,


98

was flowing.

to Burnside.

Ethan a lot.

forgot who he was.

I couldn't remember.

I've been following his career
for a long time.

So I just met up with him and
started asking him these

like a little retrospective of

gone skating with him,

And he was not just, like,
a typical stake kid.


184

He was interested in music,
and art, and stuff.


185

So it was kind of fun to be
around a kid who was into that


186

0:8:19,75 --> 0:8:20,31
He was super young.

And he was just like
beyond incredible.

and said we'd like to

have you on board.

0:8:54,76 --> 0:8:59,9
ETHAN FOWLER: Yeah, it worked
out, I guess, you know?


206
0:8:59,9 --> 0:9:1,56
ED TEMPLETON: And then the weird
thing happened with us


207
0:9:1,56 --> 0:9:6,2
is, his parents moved to
Iowa City, and that was


208
0:9:6,2 --> 0:9:7,11
devastating for him.


209
0:9:7,11 --> 0:9:9,48
His skate career was
just starting.


210
0:9:9,48 --> 0:9:11,12
He's 16 years old.


211
0:9:11,12 --> 0:9:13,37
But his parents are going to
move the some butt-fuck town


212
0:9:13,37 --> 0:9:16,105
and take him away from
California and the whole skate


213
0:9:16,105 --> 0:9:17,47
scene and stuff.


214
0:9:17,47 --> 0:9:19,653
ETHAN FOWLER: Yeah, the whole
family picked up and split and


215
0:9:19,653 --> 0:9:20,42
went to Iowa--


216
0:9:20,42 --> 0:9:24,336
well, except for my brother,
who was of age.


217
0:9:24,336 --> 0:9:28,925
And Ed had offered to take me
in, kind of like a guardian


218
0:9:28,925 --> 0:9:34,22
and all that, so I could
further my career.


219
0:9:34,22 --> 0:9:36,48
But Mom wasn't having
that, so--


220
0:9:36,48 --> 0:9:38,68
ED TEMPLETON: You know, don't
worry, I'll be a good dad.


221
0:9:38,68 --> 0:9:41,28
And she was super pissed.


222
0:9:41,28 --> 0:9:44,56
I mean, she just got up and
said, how dare you.


223
0:9:44,56 --> 0:9:44,97
Fuck you.


224
0:9:44,97 --> 0:9:46,33
And like walked out
of the room.


225
0:9:46,33 --> 0:9:49,39
And I was just sitting there
like, oh shit, I really, oh,


226
0:9:49,39 --> 0:9:49,96
this sucks.


227
0:9:49,96 --> 0:9:51,85
ETHAN FOWLER: Yeah,
yeah, she was mad.


228
0:9:51,85 --> 0:9:55,605
It'd be an uncomfortable thing,
your teenage son going


229
0:9:55,605 --> 0:10:1,432
to live with his employer
buddy skate friend.


230
0:10:1,432 --> 0:10:4,72



231
0:10:4,72 --> 0:10:8,92
ETHAN FOWLER: Which I ended up
doing anyway, I mean, that


232
0:10:8,92 --> 0:10:11,56
was, like, inevitable.


233
0:10:11,56 --> 0:10:13,88
TOBIN YELLAND: I had never
met Ethan Fowler before.


234
0:10:13,88 --> 0:10:16,56
I had driven across
the United States.


235
0:10:16,56 --> 0:10:18,2
Thomas Campbell had
come with us.


236
0:10:18,2 --> 0:10:21,27
And he had the idea to stop by
his friend Ethan's house, who


237
0:10:21,27 --> 0:10:23,37
was, at that time,
16 years old.


238
0:10:23,37 --> 0:10:25,82
And he was a really amazing
skateboarder.


239
0:10:25,82 --> 0:10:28,582
And Thomas' idea was to stop
by his house, say hello to


240
0:10:28,582 --> 0:10:30,52
him, and shoot a bunch
of photos.


241
0:10:30,52 --> 0:10:33,8
And maybe we can use him for
Big Brother, you know, a


242
0:10:33,8 --> 0:10:34,86
magazine article or something.


243
0:10:34,86 --> 0:10:36,852
ETHAN FOWLER: They were coming
through from New York, and I


244
0:10:36,852 --> 0:10:40,8
had met before and shot
with Thomas and stuff.


245
0:10:40,8 --> 0:10:44,51
And we got along good, so they
came through to shoot weird


246
0:10:44,51 --> 0:10:45,75
Iowa spots.


247
0:10:45,75 --> 0:10:49,36
And then they were splitting and
said, well, we've got an


248
0:10:49,36 --> 0:10:49,61
extra seat.


249
0:10:49,61 --> 0:10:50,395
You want to come?


250
0:10:50,395 --> 0:10:54,36
And I said, well,
yeah, but I do.


251
0:10:54,36 --> 0:10:58,64
And so I just had my shit in
my backpack, like an extra


252
0:10:58,64 --> 0:11:0,33
pair of shoes and a shirt.


253
0:11:0,33 --> 0:11:1,68
And I was like, OK, let's go.


254
0:11:1,68 --> 0:11:4,68
And so I went to the bank and
took out all my money and just


255
0:11:4,68 --> 0:11:5,595
got in and split.


256
0:11:5,595 --> 0:11:6,56
And that was it.


257
0:11:6,56 --> 0:11:7,29
End of story.


258
0:11:7,29 --> 0:11:9,14
PATRICK O'DELL: Didn't
you tell your mom?


259
0:11:9,14 --> 0:11:10,68
ETHAN FOWLER: Yeah, I was
there for three days.


260
0:11:10,68 --> 0:11:15,7
I called and said I live
in San Francisco now.


261
0:11:15,7 --> 0:11:19,3
DAVE CARNIE: Yeah, one of the
first times I met Ethan, it


262
0:11:19,3 --> 0:11:19,98
was his birthday.


263
0:11:19,98 --> 0:11:23,46
And me and Tobin went
over to his house.


264
0:11:23,46 --> 0:11:25,54
And he was kind of weird.


265
0:11:25,54 --> 0:11:26,74
He just seemed-- he was
just kind of odd.


266
0:11:26,74 --> 0:11:29,57
He was, like, playing jazz,
and playing his drums, and


267
0:11:29,57 --> 0:11:33,45
listening to jazz music really
loud, like really crazy jazz.


268
0:11:33,45 --> 0:11:36,21
And he was drinking whiskey.


269
0:11:36,21 --> 0:11:37,84
I remember that.


270
0:11:37,84 --> 0:11:40,2
And he was only 15
or something.


271
0:11:40,2 --> 0:11:43,1
And I was doing speed
at the time.


272
0:11:43,1 --> 0:11:45,3
And so I offered
him some speed.


273
0:11:45,3 --> 0:11:47,84
And he was like,
oh, fuck yeah.


274
0:11:47,84 --> 0:11:50,56
And like, I didn't know
he was 15 at the time.


275
0:11:50,56 --> 0:11:56,9
And then I learned later that
he was drunk on whiskey, he


276
0:11:56,9 --> 0:11:59,67
was high on speed, but before
all that, he had dropped two


277
0:11:59,67 --> 0:12:0,63
hits of acid.


278
0:12:0,63 --> 0:12:2,71
I don't know, obviously,
I like that


279
0:12:2,71 --> 0:12:3,68
kind of thing in people.


280
0:12:3,68 --> 0:12:5,46
So we had a good time
that night.


281
0:12:5,46 --> 0:12:6,64
ED TEMPLETON: So that's
it, you know?


282
0:12:6,64 --> 0:12:10,85
I mean, basically, he was in
our video during that time.


283
0:12:10,85 --> 0:12:13,97
That was the time we filmed
for Toy Machine Live.


284
0:12:13,97 --> 0:12:17,3
So yeah, a lot of that footage
from that period was like


285
0:12:17,3 --> 0:12:20,82
Ethan in his new phase, coming
from Iowa City, and you can


286
0:12:20,82 --> 0:12:24,36
see him in the video smoking
cigs and wearing cool vests


287
0:12:24,36 --> 0:12:25,79
and things.


288
0:12:25,79 --> 0:12:29,1
And within weeks of him being
in SF, I get a call from him


289
0:12:29,1 --> 0:12:32,68
saying, I'm running
for Stereo.


290
0:12:32,68 --> 0:12:43,3
[MUSIC PLAYING]


291
0:12:43,3 --> 0:12:45,26
CHRIS PASTRAS: Ethan just
oozed style, man.


292
0:12:45,26 --> 0:12:47,47
We always used to say,
like, it was as if he


293
0:12:47,47 --> 0:12:49,18
was born for Stereo.


294
0:12:49,18 --> 0:12:52,5
But I kind of had this vision
of like, man, I want to get


295
0:12:52,5 --> 0:12:57,19
like some skate company going
where it's all, like, solid


296
0:12:57,19 --> 0:13:1,42
skating, with big tricks, and
not all the board hitting the


297
0:13:1,42 --> 0:13:4,87
ground at the same time as
the dude or whatever.


298
0:13:4,87 --> 0:13:7,84
When he came along, it was
like the golden child of


299
0:13:7,84 --> 0:13:8,91
Stereo basically.


300
0:13:8,91 --> 0:13:11,73
And we gave him two weeks
to film that video part.


301
0:13:11,73 --> 0:13:14,1
And him and Tobin came back with
this part, and they went


302
0:13:14,1 --> 0:13:15,89
out like four or five times.


303
0:13:15,89 --> 0:13:18,0
Like the Stereo video was like,
this is what happens


304
0:13:18,0 --> 0:13:21,66
when you leave the house
with a skateboard.


305
0:13:21,66 --> 0:13:23,88
PATRICK O'DELL: Did you film
a lot of his Stereo part?


306
0:13:23,88 --> 0:13:25,83
TOBIN YELLAND: Yeah, I filmed,
probably, most of it.


307
0:13:25,83 --> 0:13:28,25
And as well as, like, I filmed
most of the video.


308
0:13:28,25 --> 0:13:31,0
And that was really fun.


309
0:13:31,0 --> 0:13:33,41
He's just like a prodigy
skateboarder.


310
0:13:33,41 --> 0:13:37,29
So he just came to San
Francisco, started filming for


311
0:13:37,29 --> 0:13:41,21
his part, and just, basically,
kind of, like, made every


312
0:13:41,21 --> 0:13:42,59
trick that he tried.


313
0:13:42,59 --> 0:13:44,59
And he was just in this like--


314
0:13:44,59 --> 0:13:47,25
this kind of mode, just being
like Superman skateboarder.


315
0:13:47,25 --> 0:13:49,75
KEEGAN SAUDER: Skateboarding
was kind of shit back then.


316
0:13:49,75 --> 0:13:53,16
You know, small wheels, creeping
at a curb, just doing


317
0:13:53,16 --> 0:13:55,45
the stab and wiggle, where
you don't even ollie.


318
0:13:55,45 --> 0:13:57,36
You just like, uhh.


319
0:13:57,36 --> 0:13:58,6
And then, I don't know.


320
0:13:58,6 --> 0:14:2,38
These guys were skating
fast and smooth.


321
0:14:2,38 --> 0:14:5,79
It was kind of like a precursor
to Eastern Exposure.


322
0:14:5,79 --> 0:14:9,52
Like it was the start of skating
getting good again.


323
0:14:9,52 --> 0:14:12,42
JAKE PHELPS: Chris Pastras and
Jason Lee were in this very


324
0:14:12,42 --> 0:14:13,6
same office.


325
0:14:13,6 --> 0:14:14,61
And they were going, looking
through their Ethan Fowler


326
0:14:14,61 --> 0:14:17,15
footage, and they were like,
man, we fucking--


327
0:14:17,15 --> 0:14:18,3
we got lucky on this kid.


328
0:14:18,3 --> 0:14:20,45
Because he was 15, he won
the world championships.


329
0:14:20,45 --> 0:14:23,9
You know, I'm not worthy,
you know?


330
0:14:23,9 --> 0:14:24,83
He did a couple three flips and
some flat grounds, some


331
0:14:24,83 --> 0:14:27,81
front boards, some big spins,
and people were like--


332
0:14:27,81 --> 0:14:29,91
in a contest, unbelievable!


333
0:14:29,91 --> 0:14:32,5
Which is all normal now, but
at that time, it was all


334
0:14:32,5 --> 0:14:34,19
really pretty earth
shattering.


335
0:14:34,19 --> 0:14:38,34
Ethan, I think he was
an amazing skater.


336
0:14:38,34 --> 0:14:42,57
He told me some really funny
things in life, I think.


337
0:14:42,57 --> 0:14:44,28
He goes, Phelps, man--


338
0:14:44,28 --> 0:14:46,32
you know, this is when he
was the slicked-back


339
0:14:46,32 --> 0:14:48,67
fucking teen wolf.


340
0:14:48,67 --> 0:14:50,4
I was like, all right,
what is it?


341
0:14:50,4 --> 0:14:51,91
And he's like, everyone
else is all trying


342
0:14:51,91 --> 0:14:52,4
to flip their board.


343
0:14:52,4 --> 0:14:53,565
Man, I just want to
ollie everything.


344
0:14:53,565 --> 0:14:57,3
And he had supreme
ollie powers.


345
0:14:57,3 --> 0:14:59,53
ETHAN FOWLER: But that
was the whole idea.


346
0:14:59,53 --> 0:15:3,51
Like, I don't think anybody on
that team was even remotely


347
0:15:3,51 --> 0:15:7,97
interested in sitting there for
three hours trying to get


348
0:15:7,97 --> 0:15:9,95
some insane thing on
a curb that they


349
0:15:9,95 --> 0:15:13,86
would make once a year.


350
0:15:13,86 --> 0:15:15,51
But no, at the time, I
don't think it was--


351
0:15:15,51 --> 0:15:17,34
I mean, it was well received
in small circles.


352
0:15:17,34 --> 0:15:21,405
But, like, for the most part,
it was like, whatever.


353
0:15:21,405 --> 0:15:22,395
You know?


354
0:15:22,395 --> 0:15:25,245
Who are these goofballs?


355
0:15:25,245 --> 0:15:27,78
PATRICK O'DELL: More like
contemporary videos, like--


356
0:15:27,78 --> 0:15:29,24
CHRIS PASTRAS: Virtual
Reality.


357
0:15:29,24 --> 0:15:30,23
PATRICK O'DELL: Virtual
reality.


358
0:15:30,23 --> 0:15:32,1
CHRIS PASTRAS: That was the
one we were up against, I


359
0:15:32,1 --> 0:15:34,4
think, in terms of timing.


360
0:15:34,4 --> 0:15:37,68
And the first girl video,
I think, had come out.


361
0:15:37,68 --> 0:15:40,53
Yeah, for sure Stereo definitely
always got a strong


362
0:15:40,53 --> 0:15:43,12
reaction, one way
or the other.


363
0:15:43,12 --> 0:15:44,94
That's for sure.


364
0:15:44,94 --> 0:17:44,94
