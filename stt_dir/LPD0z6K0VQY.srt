1
0:0:1,4 --> 0:0:4,8
- So you nervous about the fight?
- Yeah, scared to death.


2
0:0:4,8 --> 0:0:7,599
- You don't look scared.
-Well, l ain't supposed to.


3
0:0:7,599 --> 0:0:10,79
Then you don't have to do it.


4
0:0:10,79 --> 0:0:15,199
Yeah, well, l think l do.


5
0:0:15,199 --> 0:0:18,44
You know, living with you,
it hasn't been easy.


6
0:0:18,44 --> 0:0:21,119
People see me but they think of you.


7
0:0:21,119 --> 0:0:23,92
With this going on,
it's gonna be worse than ever.


8
0:0:23,92 --> 0:0:25,92
- It don't have to be.
- Sure it does.


9
0:0:25,92 --> 0:0:28,719
-Why? You got a lot goin' on, kid.
-What, my last name?


10
0:0:28,719 --> 0:0:32,96
That's the reason l got a decent job,
why people deal with me in the first place.


11
0:0:32,96 --> 0:0:38,679
Now l start to get a little ahead, to get a little
something for myself, and this happens.


12
0:0:38,679 --> 0:0:42,44
Now, l'm asking you as a favour
not to go through with this, OK?


13
0:0:42,44 --> 0:0:45,199
This is only gonna end up
bad for you and bad for me.


14
0:0:45,199 --> 0:0:48,0
- You think l'm hurtin' you?
- Yeah. In a way you are.


15
0:0:48,0 --> 0:0:51,84
- It's the last thing l ever wanted to do.
- l know that's not what you wanna do,


16
0:0:51,84 --> 0:0:55,32
but that's just the way that it is.
Don't you care what people think?


17
0:0:55,32 --> 0:0:59,76
Doesn't it bother you that people make you
out to be a joke and l'll be included in that?


18
0:0:59,76 --> 0:1:1,8
Do you think that's right?


19
0:1:1,8 --> 0:1:8,559
Do you?


20
0:1:8,559 --> 0:1:11,79
You ain't gonna believe this,


21
0:1:11,79 --> 0:1:13,48
but you used to fit right here.


22
0:1:13,48 --> 0:1:15,719
l'd hold you up and say to your mother:


23
0:1:15,719 --> 0:1:18,36
''This kid's gonna be
the best kid in the world.''


24
0:1:18,36 --> 0:1:21,679
''This kid's gonna be somebody
bettter than anybody ever knew.''


25
0:1:21,679 --> 0:1:24,519
And you grew up good and wonderrful.


26
0:1:24,519 --> 0:1:27,719
lt was great just watching.
Evey day was like a privilege.


27
0:1:27,719 --> 0:1:31,76
Then the time come for you to be your own
man and take on the world, and you did.


28
0:1:31,76 --> 0:1:36,679
But somewhere along the line,
you changed. You stopped bein' you.


29
0:1:36,679 --> 0:1:40,159
You let people stick a finger in your face
and tell you you're no good,


30
0:1:40,159 --> 0:1:43,76
and when things got hard, you started
Iookin' for somethin' to blame.


31
0:1:43,76 --> 0:1:47,28
Like a big shadow.


32
0:1:47,28 --> 0:1:51,96
l'll tell you something you already know.
The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows.


33
0:1:51,96 --> 0:1:55,8
lt's a vey mean and nasty place.
And l don't care how tough you are,


34
0:1:55,8 --> 0:1:59,84
it will beat you to your knees
and keep you there permanently if you let it.


35
0:1:59,84 --> 0:2:3,88
You, me, or nobody
is gonna hit as hard as life.


36
0:2:3,88 --> 0:2:6,0
But it ain't about how hard you hit.


37
0:2:6,0 --> 0:2:9,559
lt's about how hard you can get hit
and keep movin' forrward.


38
0:2:9,559 --> 0:2:12,8
How much you can take
and keep movin' forrward.


39
0:2:12,8 --> 0:2:15,519
That's how winnin' is done!


40
0:2:15,519 --> 0:2:18,28
lf you know what you're worth,
get what you're worth,


41
0:2:18,28 --> 0:2:21,639
but you gotta be willin' to take the hits
and not pointin' fingers,


42
0:2:21,639 --> 0:2:25,679
sayin' you ain't where you wanna be
because of him or her or anybody!


43
0:2:25,679 --> 0:2:27,84
Cowards do that, and that ain't you!


44
0:2:27,84 --> 0:2:36,159
You're better than that!


45
0:2:36,159 --> 0:2:39,519
l'm always gonna love you no matter what,


46
0:2:39,519 --> 0:2:41,719
no matter what happens.


47
0:2:41,719 --> 0:2:44,719
You're my son and you're my blood.


48
0:2:44,719 --> 0:2:48,4
You're the best thing in my life.


49
0:2:48,4 --> 0:2:56,76
But until you start believin' in yourself,
you ain't gonna have a life.


50
0:2:56,76 --> 0:4:56,76
Don't forget to visit your mother.
