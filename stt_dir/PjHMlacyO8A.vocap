###0 army colonel denise linda has ruled the bradley manning
###4 was illegally punished in quantico
###7 uh... summary break that he stayed in for nine months and their as they went
###11 through a number of
###12 degrading treatment for and kept them in the isolation
###16 and she said that uh... they were wrong in
###19 but cutting office customer one are our exercise thereof for that month
###23 period there were
###25 wrong in the uh... how they dealt with this so-called sunshine call where you
###28 would actually be go out for twenty minutes
###31 they were on the stripping him down naked
###33 uh... et cetera in fact she says quote
###36 at some point continuing p_o_i_ prevention of injury watch
###40 over the recommend
###41 insures overruled over mental health professionals becomes excessive
###45 absent a change in circumstances
###48 so yes we were right all along
###51 bradley manning worst-kept
###53 and in circumstances
###55 that would lead to his illegal punishment
###58 now what as a consequence of this
###60 now i've said
###63 you know even if he is convicted of the charges of fraud of the that he should
###66 be released now for time served you've served a lot of time
###70 he has been a malcolm warning to and military george
###74 already been illegally punished
###76 enough is enough
###78 that daniel ellsberg never went to jail
###80 for the pentagon papers and
###82 that obama administration the bush administration report
###86 leaked
###86 classified information
###88 all the time nobody ever went to jail for it
###90 that was suppose pro-government
###92 now if you need information that is not pro government all the sun
###95 you get legally punish the victorian to a military judge
###99 instead though she has said
###101 that she will
###102 take some credit
###104 and give it an applied to whatever has had this might eventually be
###109 all that is good news
###111 how much a credit is in my estimation is not great news it's nearly four months
###115 of credits a hundred twelve days
###117 that he gets for being uh...
###119 for time served
###121 on top
###122 uh... because of the illegal punishment
###125 it they will be whatever his final said this is they will remove
###129 on june twelve days from that sentence
###133 when we
###134 illegally punish people and in other cases we tortured people in
###138 this case we put them in isolation and some proposed psychological torture in
###142 fact it
###142 united nations has already
###144 uh... told us that we were in violation of
###147 of rules that led to this kind of psychological abuse
###150 uh... well i think
###153 consequence of that should not be just hey we give him another four months off
###157 remember it's in the air facing a possible
###159 life sentence
###160 so
###162 there is a life send this to inform us all of that doesn't help you much
###166 time served
###167 under free bradley manning
###169 that's what the results should be but today is a good day
###172 it is the military
###173 saying yes we were wrong and how we punish them
###176 and there should be consequences
