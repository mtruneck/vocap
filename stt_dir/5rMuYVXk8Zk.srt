(THEME SONG) This
girl eats food.


3
0:0:3,836 --> 0:0:5,42
This girl eats food.


4
0:0:5,42 --> 0:0:12,79



5
0:0:12,79 --> 0:0:14,815
JOANNA: So, I've just got all
the sweets I was never allowed


6
0:0:14,815 --> 0:0:15,455
as a child.


7
0:0:15,455 --> 0:0:18,535
Because when I was younger, my
mom used to lock me in a


8
0:0:18,535 --> 0:0:21,1
pantry with only raisins
and dry Weetabix.


9
0:0:21,1 --> 0:0:24,2
Not letting me have any sweets
made me into a sugar fiend


10
0:0:24,2 --> 0:0:25,23
when I was older.


11
0:0:25,23 --> 0:0:28,45
Oh, god, there was this guy
at my school called Kevin.


12
0:0:28,45 --> 0:0:31,3
I remember one lunch break we
all dared him to snort some


13
0:0:31,3 --> 0:0:31,47
popping candy.


14
0:0:31,47 --> 0:0:34,28
First of all he put it in
his ear, fair enough.


15
0:0:34,28 --> 0:0:35,91
And then we made him snort it.


16
0:0:35,91 --> 0:0:37,24
It was funny for
about a second,


17
0:0:37,24 --> 0:0:38,92
until he was like [UGH]


18
0:0:38,92 --> 0:0:41,3
and it's all popping
up his nose.


19
0:0:41,3 --> 0:0:42,49
What a dickhead.


20
0:0:42,49 --> 0:0:45,77
So, to make use of all my
culinary skills, I'm going to


21
0:0:45,77 --> 0:0:49,15
make the ultimate feast I
never had as a child.


22
0:0:49,15 --> 0:0:50,17
I'm going to have a popping
candy pavlova,


23
0:0:50,17 --> 0:0:52,64
and my fantasy Alcopops.


24
0:0:52,64 --> 0:0:56,67



25
0:0:56,67 --> 0:0:58,11
ANNOUNCER: Popping
candy pavlova.


26
0:0:58,11 --> 0:1:2,72



27
0:1:2,72 --> 0:1:3,58
JOANNA: Popping candy pavlova.


28
0:1:3,58 --> 0:1:5,379
It's a really easy recipe.


29
0:1:5,379 --> 0:1:8,4
It's just whipped egg whites and
sugar to make the meringue


30
0:1:8,4 --> 0:1:11,1
base, then I'm going to sprinkle
it with a buttload of


31
0:1:11,1 --> 0:1:13,54
news agent sweeties.


32
0:1:13,54 --> 0:1:16,61
ANNOUNCER: Meringue mix.


33
0:1:16,61 --> 0:1:18,46
JOANNA: Mm, phlegm.


34
0:1:18,46 --> 0:1:20,79
It feels like I'm cupping
a very delicate


35
0:1:20,79 --> 0:1:22,4
testicle right now.


36
0:1:22,4 --> 0:1:24,62



37
0:1:24,62 --> 0:1:26,84
It'll be like a fucking
huge marshmallow.


38
0:1:26,84 --> 0:1:28,34
Ah!


39
0:1:28,34 --> 0:1:29,17
OK.


40
0:1:29,17 --> 0:1:31,74
So they're nice and fluffy,
so we need to start


41
0:1:31,74 --> 0:1:33,12
dumping in the sugar.


42
0:1:33,12 --> 0:1:34,12
There's loads of it.


43
0:1:34,12 --> 0:1:37,11
You're going to add it
gradually, but it is literally


44
0:1:37,11 --> 0:1:38,2
a bag full of sugar.


45
0:1:38,2 --> 0:1:39,62
ANNOUNCER: Sugar.


46
0:1:39,62 --> 0:1:41,62
JOANNA: I think if I'd been
allowed sweets when I was


47
0:1:41,62 --> 0:1:45,22
little, and just got it out my
system then and there, I'd


48
0:1:45,22 --> 0:1:46,87
probably have a much more
refined palette.


49
0:1:46,87 --> 0:1:50,51
Because everyone else my age
started eating chorizo and


50
0:1:50,51 --> 0:1:53,59
liking olives and Guinness and
all the weird flavors, and I'm


51
0:1:53,59 --> 0:1:55,84
still eating strawberry laces.


52
0:1:55,84 --> 0:1:59,43
The next step is to plop
it onto a baking tray


53
0:1:59,43 --> 0:2:0,84
just like a cow pat.


54
0:2:0,84 --> 0:2:2,67
And you're going to put it
into the oven for an


55
0:2:2,67 --> 0:2:6,2
hour on a low heat.


56
0:2:6,2 --> 0:2:7,45
ANNOUNCER: Squirty cream.


57
0:2:7,45 --> 0:2:9,74



58
0:2:9,74 --> 0:2:11,2
JOANNA: So your pavlova's
cooked.


59
0:2:11,2 --> 0:2:13,64
You've had it out of the oven
for a couple of the hours, so


60
0:2:13,64 --> 0:2:14,6
it's nice and cool.


61
0:2:14,6 --> 0:2:15,92
So it's not going to
melt your cream.


62
0:2:15,92 --> 0:2:17,4
I love spray cream.


63
0:2:17,4 --> 0:2:19,2
It gives me a sugar boner.


64
0:2:19,2 --> 0:2:21,3
Oh, yeah.


65
0:2:21,3 --> 0:2:23,212
Just put loads on.


66
0:2:23,212 --> 0:2:24,32
Don't be a pussy.


67
0:2:24,32 --> 0:2:25,57
Just put popping candy
everywhere.


68
0:2:25,57 --> 0:2:30,65



69
0:2:30,65 --> 0:2:32,522
ANNOUNCER: Decoration.


70
0:2:32,522 --> 0:2:33,0
JOANNA: OK.


71
0:2:33,0 --> 0:2:34,5
Got the cream on.


72
0:2:34,5 --> 0:2:37,6
So now you've got
to decorate it.


73
0:2:37,6 --> 0:2:39,415
I don't mind nice girly
sweets like Flump.


74
0:2:39,415 --> 0:2:41,18
It's Kind of pretty and pink.


75
0:2:41,18 --> 0:2:43,15
But boy sweets are
so much better.


76
0:2:43,15 --> 0:2:45,78
All the characters on boy
sweets look like they're


77
0:2:45,78 --> 0:2:47,9
mescaline or something.


78
0:2:47,9 --> 0:2:49,37
Ah!


79
0:2:49,37 --> 0:2:50,88
It's like a tongue deodorant.


80
0:2:50,88 --> 0:2:53,91
It's not that she's anti-sweets,
my mum, but she


81
0:2:53,91 --> 0:2:55,52
just wanted to keep us calm.


82
0:2:55,52 --> 0:2:56,87
Because my brother was
fucking mental.


83
0:2:56,87 --> 0:2:59,34
He was always running into
ongoing traffic.


84
0:2:59,34 --> 0:3:1,1
And whenever my dad gave
me sweets, I was really


85
0:3:1,1 --> 0:3:4,31
obnoxious, that's when I
discovered swearing as well.


86
0:3:4,31 --> 0:3:5,25
She could have given
us Ritalin.


87
0:3:5,25 --> 0:3:7,85
I would have been much
happier on Ritalin.


88
0:3:7,85 --> 0:3:9,1
Ah!


89
0:3:9,1 --> 0:3:11,31



90
0:3:11,31 --> 0:3:13,98
ANNOUNCER: Alco-float.


91
0:3:13,98 --> 0:3:18,8
JOANNA: So now, for the puberty
portion of my dessert.


92
0:3:18,8 --> 0:3:20,82
When I was a teenager, I
have to say, I was a


93
0:3:20,82 --> 0:3:21,95
bit of a late bloomer.


94
0:3:21,95 --> 0:3:23,53
So when everyone else was
behind the park benches,


95
0:3:23,53 --> 0:3:27,21
getting finger banged, I was
just on my own, downing


96
0:3:27,21 --> 0:3:29,97
schnapps and playing
with my Tamagotchi.


97
0:3:29,97 --> 0:3:33,484
Then just finish off with
the peach schnapps.


98
0:3:33,484 --> 0:3:34,665
ANNOUNCER: Schnapps.


99
0:3:34,665 --> 0:3:38,6
JOANNA: Have a swig of that.


100
0:3:38,6 --> 0:3:39,59
Mm.


101
0:3:39,59 --> 0:3:39,94
Peachy.


102
0:3:39,94 --> 0:3:42,92
Now it's got just enough room
for a dollop of ice cream.


103
0:3:42,92 --> 0:3:45,496
There we go.


104
0:3:45,496 --> 0:3:46,73
Look at that.


105
0:3:46,73 --> 0:3:50,75
The perfect peaches
and cream drink.


106
0:3:50,75 --> 0:3:53,24
So, there's my popping
candy pavlova and my


107
0:3:53,24 --> 0:3:55,876
fancy Alcopop float.


108
0:3:55,876 --> 0:4:1,31
[EXPLOSIONS]

0:4:1,31 --> 0:4:3,854
(THEME SONG) This

110
0:4:3,854 --> 0:4:6,64
This girl eats food.


111
0:4:6,64 --> 0:4:8,115
This girl eats food.


112
0:4:8,115 --> 0:6:8,115
