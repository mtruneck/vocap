###9 BEN: Your heart's racing.
###11 Obviously, you're hoping that we wouldn't get caught.
###13 
###24 -There's something about the hobo that has to be recorded
###28 in American history.
###30 BEN: The whole time we were asking ourselves, what is the
###33 story here?
###35 What is the story of the hobo?
###38 What is a hobo?
###40 EMPRESS VAGABOND HOBO LUMP: It's not like people think.
###41 It's hard, like, a hard life.
###45 -It's speeding up!
###47 Go go go go go go!
###48 
###74 [APPLAUSE]
###77 
###80 AARON SMITH: This is Britt, Iowa.
###80 It's a small town of about 2,000 people out in the
###83 central Iowa cornfields.
###85 Over the last 112 years, Britt has become
###87 known for one thing--
###88 an annual event called The National Hobo Convention.
###92 There's a hobo jungle, a hobo museum, and a hobo cemetery.
###96 In 1900, Britt was just a newly incorporated farming
###99 community in search of migrant workers.
###101 The town founders enticed the hobos to move their annual
###103 gathering from Chicago to Britt.
###105 
###108 A tradition was born that still brings self-described
###110 hobos to Britt every year for one August weekend.
###113 
###116 HOBO MIKE: I've been traveling trains since I was eight, and
###119 as a living since '63.
###122 FROG: I started riding trains when I was 20 years old.
###124 I'm 62 years old now.
###126 WRONG WAY: [LAUGHING]
###127 I'm Wrong Way.
###128 My nephew gave me that name in the early '70s.
###132 HOBO SPIKE: I started in 1952, and I used a train to go from
###136 one place to another to find work, and
###137 that's how I survived.
###139 AARON SMITH: Most historians agree the hobo emerged after
###141 the Civil War.
###143 Young men from both sides set off across the country in
###145 search of work.
###146 By the turn of the century, the hobo had become part of
###148 the fabric of America.
###150 But today, what was once a substantial culture and way of
###153 life seems close to extinction.
###155 We wanted to see what was left of the hobo community, and we
###157 hoped we'd find it in Britt.
###161 In our minds, there was only one way to travel to the hobo
###163 convention-- the freight train.
###165 We began our journey in Oakland, California, hoping to
###167 travel 1,900 miles on the rails in five days.
###170 
###176 AARON SMITH: These are the maps that show the different
###177 rail lines all over California, with like, special
###181 zoom-ins that show you all the little small towns that you
###185 can stop in, different crew changes, and this is something
###188 totally like, pre-iPhone.
###190 Now you can totally just GPS your location.
###193 But these maps were really helpful for a lot of people
###195 for a long time.
###197 Before a cohesive network of roads was laid across America,
###199 the train was the fastest way to get from place to place.
###202 Early hobos learned to ride by swapping information with
###205 other travelers they met along the way in hobo jungles.
###207 
###213 Chris is from Virginia and spends his time hopping
###216 freight trains around the country for pleasure.
###218 Our friend Ben lives in San Francisco and had a couple
###221 weeks off work and decided to join us.
###223 BEN: I wasn't sure what to expect of the trip.
###225 I knew it was going to be an adventure, but I didn't know
###228 exactly what the details and the minutiae of
###232 the trip would hold.
###233 
###262 We woke up that morning, hoping to catch a train.
###265 But we woke up, got ready, there was no train there.
###268 And as more time passed, we realized that the information
###270 we had gotten was probably incorrect.
###272 
###277 AARON SMITH: We decided to wait for another train, but a
###280 worker spotted us in the yard and called the bull.
###284 Bull is an old-time term for a railroad cop.
###286 It's always been a cat and mouse game between the hobo
###289 and the bull.
###289 Back in the day, bulls had no problem killing hobos.
###291 Today, it's a little bit different.
###293 
###310 -We don't really have hobos anymore.
###313 -A transient, a hobo, vagrant, is a guy who participates on
###317 the rail property--
###318 trespass, hopping freights, yeah.
###321 -And a tramp, tramp's in the middle, right?
###322 -What did they call it?
###323 Tramps.
###323 I like that.
###324 That was back in the day, man.
###325 That was back in the day.
###327 Tramps, hobos.
###328 -When have you seen somebody with a broomstick--
###330 -A tramp with a bag tied around his shoulder, right?
###334 All right, guys.
###335 You know how to get out of here, right?
###337 Don't come back, all right?
###340 -Don't come back.
###341 AARON SMITH: There seem to be very few people
###343 hopping trains anymore.
###344 The hobo seems like a museum piece.
###347 It's like a joke, a word nobody uses anymore.
###349 We didn't want to go to the Oakland jail, so we headed to
###352 Amtrak station with our tails between our legs.
###355 We got out to the next crew change stop on the line--
###357 Roseville, California.
###359 
###362 As soon as we got to Roseville, there was a train
###363 getting ready to take off.
###365 
###386 Bad decision.
###388 A conductor saw us and we got pulled off the train five
###390 miles outside of town.
###393 Uh, we just got pulled off this train here.
###395 -Again.
###396 AARON SMITH: Yeah, yeah, it was the second time today.
###398 Morale was low.
###399 Chris decided to set off on his own to Denver, and we
###402 hopped a gambling bus to Reno, Nevada.
###404 
###417 JACKSON FAGER: Now we're in Reno, Nevada, feeling a little
###419 better about our situation, and hoping a train comes in
###422 the next couple hours.
###423 
###426 AARON SMITH: In the yard, avoiding bulls and workers is
###427 one concern.
###428 Finding a rideable car is another.
###430 Some of the wells on these double-stacked cars have a
###432 cubby hole you can ride in, but we
###433 weren't seeing anything.
###434 
###438 The locomotive at the back of the train, called the rear
###441 unit, seemed like our best bet.
###442 But it's risky.
###443 Workers periodically check the cars.
###445 
###454 Lucky for us, the train aired up, and we
###456 finally got on our way.
###457 
###463 We're indoors, Amtrak style, and we've got these big plushy
###467 seats, continuing along.
###469 
###486 We're in the middle of nowhere.
###489 For the first 100 miles, there were no roads, no
###493 highways, no nothing.
###494 It was just desert as far as the eye could see.
###497 It was beautiful.
###498 It was amazing to kind of get that, see what that was like,
###501 vast expanses of nature.
###502 
###554 MEDICINE MAN: Now, everybody thinks that the real hobo life
###556 is great, and it's part of wanderlust, but it's not.
###564 The hobo life is a very, very dangerous life.
###567 ADMAN: Sometimes painful, when everything is all fucked up.
###573 You're looking around, and the bulls are out there.
###577 BEN: It felt like something out of a special operations
###580 combat mission.
###582 
###586 We spotted a grain train.
###587 We knew that this was our ticket out of Elko.
###590 Go go go go go!
###592 
###617 ADMAN: Riding on a flat car with a full moon, and watching
###623 the [CLICKING NOISE]
###630 It's a game that gives you a fucking hard-on, I
###632 can tell you that.
###634 
###645 MINNESOTA JIM: Once you do it, it's with you
###647 the rest your life.
###648 You want to keep on the move.
###651 
###657 ADMAN: We see the world in a different light.
###660 
###667 FROG: Always total, absolute freedom, every day of my life.
###674 HOBO SPIKE: I don't think there's any better way to see
###675 this great world of ours, especially our nation, than
###678 from a freight train.
###679 
###684 AARON SMITH: We were crossing the Great Salt Lake.
###686 The air was cool, and the smell of sulfur
###688 rose from the water.
###689 It was the most undisturbed stretch of natural beauty any
###692 of us had ever seen.
###693 
###695 The train forces you to slow down and take it all in.
###699 All the frustrations and anxieties of life back in
###701 civilization seemed to disappear.
###702 
###709 HOBO SPIKE: When you're on the rails, if you don't get
###711 caught, there's no one to tell you what to do, when to go to
###714 bed, when to get up, what to eat.
###716 You're on your own for 100%.
###717 AARON SMITH: Although we were loving the ride, we were
###719 running out of water fast.
###721 After close to 24 hours on the train, we were hungry, tired,
###724 dirty, and dehydrated.
###725 
###728 Well, our train stopped here in Green River, Wyoming.
###732 It's just a little railroad town here in southern Wyoming.
###736 Just kind of roamed around and got the vibe of the town.
###739 HOBO SPIKE: Then when you get into a community, of course
###741 you have to fit into society, so you have to abide by laws
###745 at that time.
###746 But if you're by yourself, you don't have to pay
###748 attention to any law.
###750 AARON SMITH: So we walked over this bridge that we're sitting
###752 under now, probably about 110 degrees, dry heat.
###756 BEN: Just took a dip in the Green River.
###758 After four or five days not showering, it felt amazing.
###763 AARON SMITH: I'm gonna go get in there right now.
###767 BEN: Our days have been very full.
###769 We haven't gotten a lot of sleep.
###770 It's been a few hours here, a few hours there, trying to hop
###774 on trains successfully, which we sometimes
###777 have, sometimes haven't.
###779 We're always on the move trying to get to our end goal,
###781 which is Britt.
###784 AARON SMITH: No eastbound trains were coming through.
###786 The sun went down, and we enjoyed the solitude of the
###789 Wyoming landscape.
###790 Up to this point, we hadn't seen any other travelers on
###792 the trains.
###794 
###796 At the turn of the century, there were around a million
###798 hobos on the rails.
###800 After the Depression, that number doubled.
###801 Hobos had organized their own union, and there were over 60
###804 hobo colleges all across the country.
###806 Boxcars were crowded with riders.
###809 But something happened midway through the century.
###811 Maybe it was American prosperity.
###813 Where there were once millions on the road, today, there's
###815 probably a couple thousand.
###817 In my experience, you hardly ever see anyone on the rails.
###820 
###825 The next morning, we decided to try our luck in the Green
###827 River yard.
###828 
###831 -Hey, man.
###832 -How about yourself?
###833 
###838 -We're hitchhiking.
###840 
###844 -Sorry, man.
###845 
###848 -Oh, really?
###851 -All right, thank you.
###852 
###854 -OK, man.
###855 -Thank you.
###858 AARON SMITH: After getting warned by the cops to leave,
###860 we went back to our original spot under the bridge.
###863 
###870 MEDICINE MAN: Today, you don't want to jump a train.
###873 It's so dangerous, because the old steam locomotives, it was
###876 chug, chug, chug, and pretty soon, it was [ENGINE NOISE].
###878 But today, in two minutes, they're flying.
###881 
###892 AARON SMITH: Our train stopped in the middle of the yard, and
###894 we didn't know why.
###895 
###900 AARON SMITH: An hour went by, and it felt like an eternity.
###903 
###912 Each time you get on the train, it's
###913 a role of the die--
###914 a unique and unpredictable experience.
###916 Perhaps that's one reason we do it--
###918 to gamble, to relinquish control completely, and give
###921 ourselves to fate and luck.
###922 
###929 That was one of the faster ones I've hopped on.
###931 You kind of had to run alongside and kind of throw
###934 yourself up.
###934 But we all made it.
###935 Really grateful for that.
###937 
###943 The train out of Green River had three units and looked
###945 like it would blaze across Wyoming, but it puttered along
###948 the entire time at 35 miles an hour.
###951 It was time for a change of plans.
###955 We arrived in Laramie, Wyoming on Friday morning, with still
###958 800 miles to go to get to Britt.
###960 We were behind schedule, and the
###961 convention had already started.
###963 We got off here in Laramie, Wyoming because the train was
###965 so damn slow.
###967 Rent a cars were too expensive, the Greyhound would
###969 take two days, so we ended up getting this U-Haul.
###973 12-hour drive ahead of us, and we've gotta haul ass to Britt.
###976 
###979 In keeping with the spirit of our trip, we picked up all the
###981 hitchhikers we saw along the way.
###984 JOE YOUNG: Hey, what's up, guys?
###986 I'm Joe Young.
###987 I've been on the road for about four or five years.
###990 The only way I get around is on bicycle.
###993 
###996 AARON SMITH: We picked up another guy.
###997 This is Alex.
###998 He's coming from Colorado.
###999 ALEX: How's it going?
###1001 AARON SMITH: It didn't take us long to fill up the back of
###1002 the U-Haul.
###1004 
###1010 After six grueling days of traveling, we
###1012 finally arrived in Brit.
###1013 We were ready to hang out with hundreds of hobos and swap
###1016 stories about our travels on the rails.
###1018 -Hello!
###1019 Happy Hobo Days!
###1020 
###1024 -Happy Hobo Days!
###1025 -What we found instead was a family-friendly event with a
###1028 bunch of tourists.
###1030 BEN: Just a number of townspeople, big farm
###1032 tractors, fancy or unusual cars, and homemade floats.
###1037 People-- not hobos.
###1039 -All aboard!
###1039 -The hobo convention has gone county fair mainstream.
###1045 This wasn't the wild, drunken, turn of the century event that
###1048 brought 1,800 hobos here in the 1940s.
###1051 -Well, we're serving mulligan stew, and it is what the
###1055 traditional hobo used to serve.
###1057 Meat-- we have pork in ours-- and then it has beef
###1060 flavoring, and pork flavoring, and then vegetables, barley,
###1062 and rice in it, and then water.
###1065 -Every year for the past 112 years, the hobos have elected
###1068 a hobo king and queen.
###1072 -This year, our new queen is Angel.
###1077 And your new king is Minnesota Jim.
###1080 
###1084 -It's an important moment for them, especially now that most
###1087 of the hobos are senior citizens.
###1088 
###1097 The hobo jungle in Britt is a well maintained park on the
###1100 edge of town.
###1101 It used to be a pretty wild place.
###1103 EMPRESS VAGABOND HOBO LUMP: This is not the same.
###1104 They bring in like a family affair, and a history thing,
###1109 and people learning.
###1110 Because the hobo, you wouldn't be finding no children in an
###1113 old camp, you know what I mean?
###1117 People really was kind of sleeping out, and across the
###1120 tracks or in the bush.
###1121 It was more like a jungle.
###1123 
###1128 AARON SMITH: Today, there's a lot of rules.
###1130 No drinking, no drugs, no unleashed dogs.
###1134 It's become the kind of place that people used to become
###1136 hobos to get away from.
###1137 
###1142 Most of the hobos we met were retired from riding trains.
###1144 Living an itinerant life for decades takes its toll.
###1148 MEDICINE MAN: A modern-day hobo, probably in my
###1151 estimation, is getting to the point where it's rubber tire
###1154 hobos that come together and perpetuate history.
###1159 AARON SMITH: The convention has become a shadow of its
###1161 former self.
###1162 The city's turned it into a parody.
###1165 There are still plenty young people out there riding the
###1167 rails for adventure, but those who call themselves hobos and
###1170 travel around looking for work are a dying breed.
###1172 FROG: And it's still there.
###1174 Though I'm not riding freight trains, it's still there.
###1176 I still want to ride.
###1178 
###1182 AARON SMITH: Out on the rails, we slowed down and experienced
###1186 an adventure that was once a way of life
###1187 for a lot of people.
###1189 The train tracks persist on, relics on the landscape, entry
###1192 points into the hidden world.
###1194 We felt a deep nostalgia for a time that's passed and sadness
###1198 for the American hobo, fast disappearing down the
###1200 westbound track.
###1202 FROG: I have one final ride, and it's my westbound journey.
###1206 -For the moments of happiness, for the love, for the moments
###1212 of disappointments, for everything, hobo is thankful
###1219 to the railroad.
###1220
