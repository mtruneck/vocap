###64 
###67 Man.
###70 Cheers.
###71 
###74 [INAUDIBLE]
###75 
###78 chilling.
###80 MALE SPEAKER: What are you gonna do today?
###84 ANTWUAN DIXON: I really don't know.
###85 I'm fixin' to go to the store.
###88 I really don't know, dog.
###90 I swear to God, I was asleep like [INAUDIBLE].
###92 
###98 MALE SPEAKER: It doesn't seem like he skates that much.
###100 LIZARD KING: Yeah.
###101 I hear about him doing shit sometimes and shit.
###103 But he used to be able to go to a spot, any spot you take
###106 him to, and he'd fucking get a trick no matter what.
###107 ANTWUAN DIXON: Ha, ha, shit.
###111 Damn!
###113 ERIK ELLINGTON: I think a combination of a lot of things
###114 distracted him from skating.
###115 MALE SPEAKER: Like what?
###117 ERIK ELLINGTON: I don't know.
###117 I mean, there's a lot of things.
###119 I don't really want to get too personal with it.
###121 ANDREW REYNOLDS: I mean, I know I had a conversation once
###123 with him about filming a video part.
###125 And I'm like--
###126 
###128 pretty much his type of skating.
###132 It's not quantity that people are really looking for.
###136 So I'm like, if you get one trick a month for the time
###139 you're filming for the video, then you could go on and be a
###142 pro skater and make money for a long time.
###146 That's it.
###149 But then he says he's gonna get on it.
###151 I talk to him occasionally when I see him and always say,
###155 like, let's go skate.
###159 Or are you gonna skate?
###160 It's like he wants to skate, but it's just--
###163 I don't know.
###163 Like I said, that other stuff just gets in the way, I think.
###166 MALE SPEAKER: How come we didn't go skating with Andrew?
###170 ANTWUAN DIXON: When?
###171 MALE SPEAKER: Today.
###173 ANTWUAN DIXON: What?
###174 MALE SPEAKER: Andrew went skating.
###176 ANTWUAN DIXON: Oh, I don't know.
###179 [LAUGHS]
###180 I don't know, shit just got crazy, man.
###183 ANDREW REYNOLDS: He's just funny.
###185 Like, he doesn't really understand that a bad hangover
###188 is going to mess up his skating.
###191 I'm like, well, just get up.
###194 [INAUDIBLE]
###194 just go wherever he goes.
###195 He's like, I feel bad in the morning, though, man.
###198 I'm just, like, tired and shit, man.
###199 It's like, all right.
###202 LIZARD KING: He's rad to go on tour with.
###204 Like, sometimes I'll see him fucking trying to
###207 fight me and shit.
###208 He'll be my best friend, like hanging out with me, buying me
###212 little toys and shit.
###214 And then next thing I know, he's wasted.
###216 And I say something, and he's so offended that he's swinging
###220 at me, punching me in the face and shit.
###222 ANTWUAN DIXON: [INAUDIBLE].
###223 MALE SPEAKER: Did he punch a cop maybe?
###227 LIZARD KING: Fuck, probably.
###228 MALE SPEAKER: And have you been around him when he's
###230 getting in trouble with cops and shit like that?
###233 SHANE HEYL: Yeah.
###234 MALE SPEAKER: Are there any stories you can think of?
###238 SHANE HEYL: No.
###240 No.
###242 
###247 I mean, the fight on the plane, that was intense.
###250 That was the craziest shit I've ever been
###254 a part of and witnessed.
###254 [SCREAMING]
###255 MALE SPEAKER: Knock this shit off!
###256 Come on, guys.
###257 MALE SPEAKER: Hey, knock it off.
###258 MALE SPEAKER: We're just trying to get off the plane.
###259 SHANE HEYL: And these drunk assholes that were sitting
###262 behind us were just being racist,
###264 saying dumb shit from--
###266 I think North Carolina all the way to LA.
###268 LIZARD KING: And we're flying for so long.
###270 And then you see both those guys get kind of restless and
###273 take their headphones out.
###274 And those dudes are like, fucking blah, blah, blah
###277 niggers, go back where you came from and shit.
###279 They're laughing and shit.
###280 SHANE HEYL: We're finally landing the plane.
###283 Guy just keeps running his mouth.
###285 And you hear that, bing, time to take your seat belt off.
###288 LIZARD KING: Antwuan gets up.
###289 And he's like, what the fuck?
###290 And blah, blah, blah.
###292 Boom.
###292 The dude slaps Antwuan.
###294 Instantly, TK hops over his seat, starts
###297 smashing the brother.
###299 Dude's face is bloody as shit.
###301 This fucking random black dude from the front of the plane
###304 fucking comes running down the aisle and takes out one of the
###307 dudes, too.
###307 He just starts pounding one of the dudes.
###308 So it's fucking TK, some random dude, and Antwuan on a
###313 plane fuckin' beating two dudes up.
###315 SHANE HEYL: And we're in the back of the plane, and you
###316 can't even move.
###318 People are screaming and losing their shit.
###320 And they can't believe that this is going down.
###321 None of us can believe it's going down.
###323 And then you've got people running from the front, trying
###325 to stop it.
###326 And it's like, get the fuck out of there, man.
###330 Get out.
###330 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###332 ANTWUAN DIXON: He been a racist the whole flight.
###333 FEMALE SPEAKER: We're humans, man.
###334 We're humans.
###335 It's all good.
###336 ANTWUAN DIXON: Y'all motherfuckers
###336 shut the fuck up.
###337 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###339 MALE SPEAKER: What came of it?
###340 How come Terry or Antwuan didn't go to jail?
###343 SHANE HEYL: Because those dudes were in the wrong and
###345 there was witnesses for it.
###346 LIZARD KING: All these people make reports.
###348 And they're like, these guys were just making racial slurs
###351 the whole entire flight.
###352 You should let these kids go.
###353 These guys deserved it.
###355 Like, there you go, you got beat the fuck up.
###357 Later.
###358 That's it.
###361 That shit was fucking insane, man.
###363 And don't get me wrong, though.
###365 Antwuan's one of the nicest fucking people I've ever met,
###368 one of the most genuine people, a caring person.
###370 ANTWUAN DIXON: [LAUGHS]
###371 piece of shit, faggot, Gaylord fuck.
###374 MALE SPEAKER: [LAUGHS]
###376 ANTWUAN DIXON: [INAUDIBLE].
###377 
###381 LIZARD KING: He doesn't give a fuck.
###382 He loves the attention, man.
###384 ANTWUAN DIXON: I'm thirsty.
###386 LIZARD KING: Loves putting on a show, man.
###389 That's what it is, dude.
###391 He's like a hijinks show in reality.
###395 ANTWUAN DIXON: Whatever, nigger.
###396 I got a wife-beater, nigger.
###396 A wife-beater, nigger.
###400 [INAUDIBLE].
###401

###465 You know what I'm saying?
###466 Niggers ain't turn down.
###467 Niggers get turned up, nigger.
###468 [LAUGHTER]
###470 ERIK ELLINGTON: I just think that's stuff that he's working
###473 through, like personal issues that he's working through.
###475 And he's got some of them.
###478 And I think that that should probably just be kept between
###481 him and whoever he wants to know about it.
###484 It's not really my place to talk about it.
###486 But everybody kind of knows what.
###490 He can get into some trouble.
###491 
###493 ANTWUAN DIXON: Dixon, D-I-X-O-N.
