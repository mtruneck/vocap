1
0:0:0,799 --> 0:0:31,619
Emwi not only eats monkeys,
she loves them.


2
0:0:31,619 --> 0:0:35,51
Almost all Awa families
keep a number of monkey pets.


3
0:0:35,51 --> 0:0:41,64
There are eight different species
in the village.


4
0:0:41,64 --> 0:0:45,75
The Awa show extraordinary
tenderness for the little monkeys,


5
0:0:45,75 --> 0:0:52,879
believing they're more human
than animal.


6
0:0:52,879 --> 0:1:7,57
Emwi is a devoted mother,
both to her children and her monkeys.


7
0:1:7,57 --> 0:1:16,23
For 
Emwi and the other Awa,


8
0:1:16,23 --> 0:1:31,77
breastfeeding monkeys is simply
a natural way to help an orphan in need.


9
0:1:31,77 --> 0:1:35,6
Caring so intimately for an animal
they regularly kill


10
0:1:35,6 --> 0:1:37,45
may appear contradictory,


11
0:1:37,45 --> 0:1:41,78
but the Awa believe for everything
they take from the forest,


12
0:1:41,78 --> 0:1:53,81
they have to give back.


13
0:1:53,81 --> 0:1:58,3
When our lives are so deeply
entwined with animals and plants,


14
0:1:58,3 --> 0:2:1,91
they inevitably become
a great source of inspiration.


15
0:2:1,91 --> 0:2:7,26
Perhaps the most spectacular case
of culture imitating nature


16
0:2:7,26 --> 0:2:24,59
is found amongst the people
of Papua New Guinea.


17
0:2:24,59 --> 0:2:25,79
Deep in the forest,


18
0:2:25,79 --> 0:2:32,15
a male superb bird of paradise struts
his stuff for a rather drab female


19
0:2:32,15 --> 0:2:38,62
but she isn't the only one watching.


20
0:2:38,62 --> 0:2:46,4
Geling is a bird of paradise hunter


21
0:2:46,4 --> 0:3:19,51
and it's the highly prized feathers
he's after.


22
0:3:19,51 --> 0:3:23,569
These coveted plumes are passed
down through generations


23
0:3:23,569 --> 0:3:29,69
but occasionally damaged ones
need replacing.


24
0:3:29,69 --> 0:3:36,16
Birds of paradise are so hard to hunt,
however, that Geling's enlisted help.


25
0:3:36,16 --> 0:3:43,77
Peke is after the long tail feathers
of the Princess Astrapia,


26
0:3:43,77 --> 0:4:14,3
and he's using fruit to lure them in


27
0:4:14,3 --> 0:4:17,87
Tomorrow is a big day for Geling.


28
0:4:17,87 --> 0:4:20,609
His clan will be performing
at a Sing Sing,


29
0:4:20,609 --> 0:4:23,55
where his reputation
and the honour of his village


30
0:4:23,55 --> 0:4:34,779
will be judged on the quality
of his feather collection.


31
0:4:34,779 --> 0:4:36,99
Sing Sing events are all about competing


32
0:4:36,99 --> 0:4:39,419
to see who's the best-dressed,


33
0:4:39,419 --> 0:4:55,759
and Geling knows not a plume
can be out of place.


34
0:4:55,759 --> 0:4:57,469
In both birds and humans,


35
0:4:57,469 --> 0:5:1,889
it's the most eye-catching
who gets the most attention,


36
0:5:1,889 --> 0:5:12,62
though Geling might be
overstating his conquests.


37
0:5:12,62 --> 0:5:20,46
(CHANTING)


38
0:5:20,46 --> 0:5:35,4
The Mount Hagen Sing Sing


39
0:5:35,4 --> 0:5:43,12
is the world's largest jungle-themed
fancy-dress party.


40
0:5:43,12 --> 0:5:45,479
Attended by hundreds of tribes,


41
0:5:45,479 --> 0:5:50,8
it's one of New Guinea's
biggest national events.


42
0:5:50,8 --> 0:6:1,3
Amidst the mayhem, Geling's putting
the finishing touches to his outfit.


43
0:6:1,3 --> 0:6:15,909
In New Guinea, male vanity
is something to flaunt.


44
0:6:15,909 --> 0:6:21,11
Though each clan has its own style...


45
0:6:21,11 --> 0:6:28,27
...almost all wear bird of paradise
feathers as their crowning glory.


46
0:6:28,27 --> 0:6:37,58
In their looks,
and even their courtship dances,


47
0:6:37,58 --> 0:6:46,619
the parallels between man and animal
are unmistakable.


48
0:6:46,619 --> 0:6:50,309
They're birds of a feather.


49
0:6:50,309 --> 0:6:58,749
Both use these precious plumes
to display fitness and beauty.


50
0:6:58,749 --> 0:7:14,39
Taking centre stage,
it's Geling's turn to show off.


51
0:7:14,39 --> 0:7:20,259
This deep connection with birds of
paradise began 40,000 years ago...


52
0:7:20,259 --> 0:7:28,479
...and it shows few signs of fading.


53
0:7:28,479 --> 0:7:29,96
Geling's getting on a bit,


54
0:7:29,96 --> 0:7:35,919
and his female admirers aren't quite
as plentiful as they used to be...


55
0:7:35,919 --> 0:7:41,159
...but he's not going to let that
ruffle his feathers.


56
0:7:41,159 --> 0:7:49,29
The diverse nature of the rainforest
influences the people who live here


57
0:7:49,29 --> 0:7:50,199
in endless ways


58
0:7:50,199 --> 0:7:58,86
and it often leads to
breathtaking results.


59
0:7:58,86 --> 0:8:2,379
For the Bayaka tribe
of Africa's Congo basin,


60
0:8:2,379 --> 0:8:14,689
it's the sounds of the jungle
that most inspire them.


61
0:8:14,689 --> 0:8:34,69
(RHYTHMIC BEAT)


62
0:8:34,69 --> 0:8:39,719
Whether using a river as a drum kit...


63
0:8:39,719 --> 0:8:43,979
...or incorporating animal calls
into their work songs...


64
0:8:43,979 --> 0:8:56,6
...the Bayaka consider music to be
their greatest gift from the forest.


65
0:8:56,6 --> 0:9:1,67
(SINGING)


66
0:9:1,67 --> 0:9:11,68
But there's something else found here
that the Bayaka prize just as highly.


67
0:9:11,68 --> 0:9:17,89
So highly they're prepared
to risk their lives for it.


68
0:9:17,89 --> 0:9:22,519
Tete and Mongonje are on the hunt,


69
0:9:22,519 --> 0:9:45,23
but it's not meat they're after.


70
0:9:45,23 --> 0:9:48,67
Honey is liquid gold to the Bayaka,


71
0:9:48,67 --> 0:9:53,899
and they go to extraordinary lengths
to gather it.


72
0:9:53,899 --> 0:9:55,339
Using a special vine,


73
0:9:55,339 --> 0:10:8,44
Tete makes a harness to help him
get to grips with this 40-metre tree.


74
0:10:8,44 --> 0:10:13,399
Climbing like this requires skill,
strength and stamina,


75
0:10:13,399 --> 0:10:16,74
especially in the tropical heat.


76
0:10:16,74 --> 0:10:22,509
While Tete climbs, Mongonje prepares
a bundle of smoking leaves


77
0:10:22,509 --> 0:10:33,16
to help pacify the bees.


78
0:10:33,16 --> 0:10:48,18
An hour's passed and Tete's
making impressive progress.


79
0:10:48,18 --> 0:11:8,899
But he's still got a way to go.


80
0:11:8,899 --> 0:11:13,99
News that honey's been found
has spread quickly,


81
0:11:13,99 --> 0:11:28,6
and Tete's wife and kids
come 


82
0:11:28,6 --> 0:11:29,42
to watch.


83
0:11:29,42 --> 0:11:32,49
Tete's finally made it
to the crown of the tree


84
0:11:32,49 --> 0:11:48,54
but to go any further he'll have to
leave the security of his vine.


85
0:11:48,54 --> 0:12:3,829
Tete's fully aware how dangerous
honey gathering is,


86
0:12:3,829 --> 0:12:9,269
but the Bayaka believe it's bravery
that makes the man,


87
0:12:9,269 --> 0:12:12,129
and sugar is so scarce in these forests


88
0:12:12,129 --> 0:12:19,129
that honey is the best nutrition
Tete can provide for his family.


89
0:12:19,129 --> 0:12:54,949
40 metres up, and unattached,
Tete can't put a foot wrong.


90
0:12:54,949 --> 0:13:8,529
And now the bees
are beginning to attack.


91
0:13:8,529 --> 0:13:10,829
He's made it to the hive,


92
0:13:10,829 --> 0:13:15,89
but he's got to get at the honey
before being overcome by bees.


93
0:13:15,89 --> 0:13:37,85
The 
smoke helps,
but Tete's still being stung.


94
0:13:37,85 --> 0:13:41,879
Finally Tete strikes gold.


95
0:13:41,879 --> 0:13:53,819
The first basket goes down
to Tete's family...


96
0:13:53,819 --> 0:14:22,199
...and even thousands of angry bees
can't stop 


97
0:14:22,199 --> 0:14:26,48
the feast.


98
0:14:26,48 --> 0:14:32,899
Tete takes time to savour his success.


99
0:14:32,899 --> 0:14:37,47
He's done enough to keep
his wife sweet, treat his children


100
0:14:37,47 --> 0:14:56,54
and earn respect from his tribe.


101
0:14:56,54 --> 0:16:56,54
For forest people, simple things
can hold extraordinary value,
