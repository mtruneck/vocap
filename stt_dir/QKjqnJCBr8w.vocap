###0 PROFESSOR: OKAY, SO I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME TO GET STARTED. SO
###3 YOU'LL RECALL LAST TIME WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE
###8 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FLOWERING PLANTS AND OTHER SEED PLANTS WE'D
###11 SEEN EARLIER THAT MIGHT AT LEAST IN PART BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR
###15 SUCCESS LIKE THE OVARY THAT PROTECTS THE OVULES AND MECHANISMS
###20 PROMOTING OUTCROSSING. AND THEN I STARTED TALKING ABOUT SOME OF
###24 THESE POLLINATION SYNDROMES THAT REFLECT ADAPTATION WITH
###29 PARTICULAR GROUPS OF POLLINATORS. WE TALKED ABOUT BEE
###33 POLLINATION, THE MOST IMPORTANT BIOTIC POLLINATION, MOTHS,
###37 BUTTERFLIES, BIRDS AND BATS. AND I JUST WANT TO WRAP THAT UP
###43 BEFORE GETTING INTO SOME OF THE INNOVATIONS OF THE ANGIOSPERM
###47 LIFE CYCLE THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER IN TERMS OF THE
###51 SUCCESS OF ANGIOSPERMS. AND THEN WE'LL TALK ABOUT FRUITS AND
###55 SEED GERMINATION TO WRAP UP THIS OVERVIEW OF DIVERSITY IN THE
###60 COURSE. AND THEN STARTING NEXT TIME WE'LL BE GETTING MORE INTO
###65 THE ANATOMY AND STRUCTURE OF PLANTS AND HOW THAT AFFECTS THEIR
###70 ABILITY TO GROW AND TRANSPORT NUTRIENTS AND WATER ET CETERA. SO
###75 SOME REALLY DIFFERENT TYPES OF ADAPTATIONS IN THINGS YOU'VE SEEN
###79 IN ANIMALS. ALL RIGHT, SO I JUST BRIEFLY TALKED ABOUT FLY
###86 POLLINATION AT THE END OF LAST LECTURE AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF
###89 DECEIT POLLINATION. REMEMBER IN POLLINATION, IT'S OFTEN A
###94 MUTUALISM WHERE THE PLANT OFFERS A REWARD TO THE POLLINATOR THAT
###98 BENEFITS IN SOME TANGIBLE WAY, OFTEN GENERALLY FOOD. THE PLANT,
###105 OF COURSE, BENEFITS BY BEING POLLINATED. BUT IN FLY POLLINATION
###109 
###109 LIKE IN THOSE BEE ORCHIDS, THE POLLINATOR LOSES, BUT IT'S STILL
###113 EFFECTIVE. THE FLY POLLINATION SYNDROME IS ASSOCIATED WITH
###120 REDDISH OR MAROON-COLORED INFLORESCENCES OR FLOWERS THAT AS I
###124 MENTIONED ARE LIGHT-SPOTTED WHICH SORT OF RESEMBLES MAGGOTS
###128 GROWING ON ROTTING MEAT. AND THEY OFTEN HAVE A FLESHY TEXTURE,
###133 I MEAN A DEFINITE FLESHY TEXTURE COMPARED TO MOST FLOWERS THAT
###136 CAN FOOL FLIES INTO THINKING THEY'RE WALKING AROUND ON ROTTING
###140 MEAT AND IN THE PROCESS POLLINATE THE PLANTS. AND THE FLOWER,
###146 THE FLORAL SCENTS ARE INCREDIBLY SIMILAR TO CADAVERS, WHICH HAS
###150 LEAD TO A LOT OF THESE PLANTS, FLOWERS BEING CALLED CORPSE
###153 FLOWERS WHICH BOTH OF THESE ARE, EVEN THOUGH THIS IS AN
###157 INFLORESCENCE, NOT A, NOT AN INDIVIDUAL FLOWER. AND SO THE
###162 FLIES, THE FEMALE FLIES VISIT THESE, THESE FLOWERS AND LAY THEIR
###166 EGGS. AND THEN THE EGGS HATCH AND THE MAGGOTS DIE. THEY STARVE
###171 TO DEATH BECAUSE THERE'S NO FOOD HERE FOR THEM. SO THIS IS REAL
###174 DECEIT POLLINATION. BUT FORTUNATELY FOR THE PLANTS AND THE
###177 FLIES, THERE ARE A LOT OF FLIES TO GO AROUND, SO THERE'S NO LOSS
###181 OF THE POLLINATOR THROUGH TIME. AND ONE OF THE NEAT THINGS
###186 ABOUT FLY POLLINATION IS IT'S ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE
###189 ABSOLUTELY HUGE INFLORESCENCES AND FLOWERS. AND I MENTIONED
###194 LAST TIME THE TITAN ARUM WHICH IS ACTUALLY IN CULTIVATION UP AT
###199 THE U.C. BOTANICAL GARDEN. AND WHEN IT FLOWERS, IT'S ADVERTISED
###204 ON THE BERKELEY HOME PAGE AND DEFINITELY WORTH CHECKING OUT. IT
###209 GETS UP TO 10 FEET TALL, THE INFLORESCENCE, AN IMMENSE THING.
###214 IT'S NATIVE TO THE FORESTS, RAIN FORESTS OF INDONESIA, WHICH
###219 
###219 HAPPENS TO BE WHERE YOU ALSO FIND THIS PLANT WHICH IS DISTANTLY
###223 RELATED. IT'S A CASE OF CONVERGENT EVOLUTION ON FLY
###226 POLLINATION. IT'S CALLED, THE NAME IS RAFFLESIA ARNOLDII. THE
###230 NAME'S NOT THAT IMPORTANT AT ALL. BUT IT'S A INDIVIDUAL FLOWER,
###235 AND IT'S THE LARGEST FLOWER KNOWN ON EARTH. IT GETS UP TO ABOUT
###239 A METER IN DIAMETER. AND IT, IT WEIGHS, IT WEIGHS IN AT OVER
###245 20 POUNDS, SO IT'S A HUGE FLOWER. AND IT'S NOT ONLY A, IT'S NOT
###250 ONLY CHEATING FLIES IN THE PROCESS OF GETTING POLLINATED BUT IT'S
###254 ALSO PARASITIZING ANOTHER FLOWERING PLANT FOR ALL OF ITS
###258 NUTRIENTS. THIS THING IS A HOLOPARASITE. IT HAS NO STEMS,
###262 LEAVES, TRUE ROOTS. IT'S JUST GROWING INSIDE THE TISSUES OF A
###266 MEMBER OF THE GRAPE FAMILY. SO YOU CAN'T EVEN TELL IT'S THERE
###270 UNTIL IT FLOWERS AND THIS GIGANTIC FLOWER EMERGES. IT'S PRETTY
###274 BIZARRE. OKAY, SO WIND POLLINATION ALSO OCCURS IN ANGIOSPERMS,
###283 AND REMEMBER THIS IS THE DOMINANT TYPE OF POLLINATION IN
###286 GYMNOSPERMS EXCEPT FOR CYCADS. AND IT'S SECONDARILY EVOLVED WE
###292 KNOW NOW FROM INSECT POLLINATION OR ANIMAL POLLINATION. IT
###298 OCCURS IN ABOUT 20 PERCENT OF ALL FLOWERING PLANTS, SO NOT AN
###300 INSIGNIFICANT NUMBER, GIVEN THAT THERE ARE LIKE 300,000 FLOWERING
###304 PLANTS. AND IT USED TO BE THOUGHT THAT THESE WIND-POLLINATED
###309 FLOWERING PLANTS MOSTLY CONSTITUTED A SINGLE GROUP, A NATURAL
###314 GROUP. BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT'S NOT TRUE. THINGS LIKE OAKS,
###318 BIRCHES, BEECHES, HAZELNUTS SHOWN HERE ARE NOT CLOSELY RELATED TO
###323 THINGS LIKE MULBERRIES AND STINGING NETTLES AND MARIJUANA WHICH
###328 ARE A SEPARATE ORIGIN OF WIND POLLINATION. AND THERE ARE SOME
###331 
###331 OTHER EXAMPLES TOO. BUT THEY'VE ALL EVOLVED, OR NOT ALL, NOT
###337 EVERY CASE, BUT THERE'S A SUITE OF FEATURES THAT THEY'VE
###340 CONVERGED ON EVOLUTIONARILY THAT MAKE THEM APPEAR VERY SIMILAR.
###345 SO IT'S A REALLY GREAT CASE WHERE WE HAVE MULTIPLE ORIGINS OF A
###348 TYPE OF POLLINATION WHERE A WHOLE SUITE OF FEATURES COMES ALONG
###352 WITH THAT THAT PRETTY CLEARLY ARE IMPORTANT ADAPTATIONS TO THAT
###355 TYPE OF POLLINATION. SO ONE THING IS THAT THE FLOWERS ARE
###360 EITHER PISTILLATE OR STAMINATE BUT NOT BOTH. SO THAT HAS SOME
###365 OBVIOUS ADVANTAGES IN TERMS OF PREVENTING SELF-POLLINATION. AND
###371 OFTEN THE PISTILLATE AND STAMINATE FLOWERS ARE BORNE IN SEPARATE
###374 INFLORESCENCES, SOMETIMES ON SEPARATE PLANTS, ALSO PROMOTING
###378 OUTCROSSING. AND THE PETALS NOT SURPRISINGLY ARE REALLY SMALL
###384 OR ALL TOGETHER ABSENT. AND THAT MAKES SENSE BOTH IN TERMS OF
###388 INVESTMENT, WHY INVEST IN A BIG ATTRACTIVE SET OF DISPLAY
###392 FEATURES WHEN YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO ATTRACT AN ANIMAL POLLINATOR
###395 ANYMORE, BUT ALSO IT'S A REAL DISADVANTAGE TO HAVE BIG SHOWY
###399 PETALS IF YOU'RE WIND-POLLINATED BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST GOING TO
###402 GET IN THE WAY OF THE POLLEN BEING DISPERSED AND RECEIVED. SO
###407 IT'S TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE PLANT TO NOT HAVE THESE INERT
###410 SURFACES AROUND THAT CAN BLOCK POLLEN. AND THAT ALSO THE CASE
###415 ABOUT THEIR FLOWERING TIME. SO IN MANY CASES, NOT ALL CASES BUT
###419 IN MANY CASES, ESPECIALLY, WELL, WHEN WE HAVE DECIDUOUS TAXA
###423 INVOLVED, WHICH MANY OF THESE ARE, A LOT OF OUR HARDWOODS FALL
###427 INTO THIS CATEGORY, WIND POLLINATION THAT ARE WINTER DECIDUOUS,
###432 THEY'LL FLOWER BEFORE THE, THE LEAVES EXPAND IN THE SPRINGTIME.
###436 
###437 AND THAT'S AN ADVANTAGE IN TERMS OF MINIMIZING BLOCKAGE OF POLLEN
###441 BY THESE INERT SURFACES. AND ALSO THE ANTHERS LIKE IN A LOT OF
###446 CASES WHERE WE HAVE DISPERSAL FROM SPORANGIA AS WELL AS
###450 MICROSPORANGIA AND GYNOSPERMS, THE ANTHERS OPEN IN DRY WEATHER
###455 WHICH PROMOTES DISPERSAL OF POLLEN. AND THEY TEND TO HAVE
###461 ENLARGED STIGMATIC SURFACES. THIS IS REALLY COMMON LIKE IN
###464 GRASSES AND OTHER GROUPS WHERE YOU GET THESE FEATHERY LOOKING
###467 STIGMAS THAT MAXIMIZE SURFACE AREA TO CAPTURE POLLEN. SO THAT'S
###472 A, A COMMON FEATURE. AND ALSO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE POLLEN
###475 ITSELF, IT'S REALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE INSECT POLLINAT- OR
###480 ANIMAL-POLLINATED FLOWERS WHERE THE POLLEN IS IN CLUMPS AND IT'S
###485 STICKY OR OILY AND ORNAMENTED. HERE YOU CAN SEE IT'S DRY AND
###490 IT'S SMOOTH-WALLED. IT'S DISPERSED IN SINGLE GRAINS, WHICH
###496 MAXIMIZES BOUNCY IN THE AIR. SO THERE'S A LOT OF THESE GREAT
###501 FEATURES THAT WIND-POLLINATED PLANTS HAVE EVOLVED. AND, AND
###506 THEY, THEY'RE REALLY, THEY CAN GET THEIR POLLEN AROUND REALLY
###509 WELL. SOME WIND-POLLINATED PLANTS CAN DISPERSE POLLEN OVER
###513 LARGE DISTANCES AND TO THE MISFORTUNE TO A LOT OF US THAT HAVE
###518 HAYFEVER, POLLEN ALLERGIES. AND THERE'S ALSO EVEN WATER
###523 POLLINATION. THIS IS REALLY RARE, BUT THERE ARE SOME
###526 ANGIOSPERMS THAT HAVE GONE BACK TO AN AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT.
###531 ANCESTRALLY THESE WERE LAND PLANTS. BUT SOME ANGIOSPERMS HAVE
###535 BECOME AQUATIC, BOTH IN FRESH WATER AND IN MARINE SITUATIONS.
###541 AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM, VALLISNERIA WHICH IS THE RIBBON WEED.
###544 AND THESE, SOME OF THESE HAVE, THEY HAVE A WHOLE, THERE'S A BUNCH
###547 
###547 OF DIFFERENT ADAPTATIONS TO POLLINATION IN THESE DIFFERENT GROUPS
###551 OF PLANTS THAT HAVE GONE BACK TO WATER. BUT IN VALLISNERIA YOU
###555 HAVE THE RELEASE OF THE MALE FLOWERS. IT ACTUALLY JUST POPS THE
###558 MALE FLOWERS OFF OF THE PEDESTAL AND THEY FLOAT UP TO THE TOP.
###562 AND THEY FLOAT AROUND ON THE SURFACE. THE FEMALE FLOWERS ARE
###566 HELD WITH SOME TENSION SO THAT THERE'S, THERE'S ACTUALLY A
###570 DEPRESSION IN THE WATER SURFACE, AND THE MALE FLOWERS FLOATING
###574 AROUND WILL BE DRAWN INTO THE DEPRESSION IN THE WATER SURFACE AND
###577 POLLINATE THE FEMALE FLOWER OR THE, I SHOULD SAY THE PISTILLATE
###580 FLOWERS. SO IN THE EELGRASSES WHICH, I SHOULD SAY RIBBON
###587 GRASSES ARE NOT REALLY GRASSES. THEY ARE MONOCOTS JUST IN CASE
###591 YOU'RE INTERESTED. EELGRASSES, WHICH YOU CAN SEE OUT IN
###594 ESTUARIES ALONG THE COAST HERE AND EVEN OUT IN THE OPEN OCEAN,
###598 ARE OUR ONLY LOCAL GROUP OF MARINE ANGIOSPERMS. AND THEY'RE
###603 ALSO NOT REALLY GRASSES, BUT THEY ARE MONOCOTS. AND THEY
###607 ACTUALLY RELEASE THEIR POLLEN UNDER WATER. POLLEN IS USUALLY
###611 REALLY VULNERABLE TO WETTING. IF POLLEN GETS WET, IT'S USUALLY
###614 CURTAINS. BUT IN THE CASE OF RIBBON, I SHOULD, EELGRASSES THEY
###618 CAN WITHSTAND EMERGING IN SALTWATER. AND THIS THREAD-LIKE POLLEN
###623 THAT IS CARRIED AROUND IN THE CURRENTS WILL WRAP AROUND THE
###627 STIGMA WHEN IT COMES INTO CONTACT AND GERMINATE IT. SO THERE'S
###631 A BUNCH OF REALLY AMAZING ADAPTATIONS OF FLOWERING PLANTS TO
###635 POLLINATION, SPECIALIZATIONS INVOLVING BOTH ABIOTIC AND BIOTIC
###641 AGENTS. OKAY, SO ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT POLLINATION? BEFORE WE
###647 MOVE ON? ALL RIGHT, SO I JUST WANT TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT SOME,
###653 
###653 SOME EVOLUTIONARY TRENDS THAT WE SEE IN FLOWERING PLANT FLOWER
###659 EVOLUTION. THERE IS A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT COME UP REPEATEDLY
###665 ACROSS FLOWERING PLANTS. ONE OF THEM IS THE LOSS OR REDUCTION
###670 IN NUMBER OF FLORAL PARTS. SO WE LOOK AT SOME OF THESE
###674 FLOWERING PLANTS THAT RECONSTRUCT AS HAVING FAIRLY ANCESTRAL
###677 FLOWERS, THEY USUALLY HAVE A LARGE AND INDEFINITE NUMBER OF PARTS
###681 OF THE DIFFERENT FLORALS OR DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PERIANTHER,
###686 SEPALS, PETALS, STAMENS, AND CARPELS. AND WE TEND TO SEE A
###689 GENERAL REDUCTION THROUGH TIME. THIS IS A RED MAPLE WHERE IT'S
###693 LOST THE PISTILS, FUNCTIONAL PISTILS IN THESE PARTICULAR FLOWERS.
###698 THERE ARE SOME PLANT, FLOWERS ON THESE PLANTS THAT CAN BE
###702 BISEXUAL. AND THEY READILY SELF. BUT WE SEE, THIS IS A
###706 PARTICULAR SPECIES WHERE WE SEE A TREND TOWARD DIOECY OCCURRING
###710 DURING THIS SNAPSHOT IN TIME. SO IT'S KIND OF AN INTERESTING
###715 SPECIES IN THAT REGARD. ALSO I MENTIONED IN WIND-POLLINATED
###719 PLANTS YOU CAN HAVE LOSS OF THE PETALS ALL TOGETHER. THERE ARE
###723 VARIOUS SPECIALIZATIONS THAT HAVE RESULTED IN LOSS OF FLORAL
###727 PARTS. AND IT'S RARE THAT WE SEE AN AMPLIFICATION IN NUMBER OF
###730 FLORAL PARTS ALTHOUGH IT CAN HAPPEN. ANOTHER THING THAT WE SEE
###736 IS FUSION OF PARTS OF BOTH THE SAME TYPE, LIKE PETALS TO PETALS
###742 IN THE CASE OF THIS FOXGLOVE HERE WHERE ALL THE PETALS ARE FUSED
###746 TOGETHER INTO THIS TUBULAR COROLLA. THAT'S A COMMON THING. WE
###751 CAN ALSO GET FUSION OF UNLIKE PARTS. FOR EXAMPLE, STAMENS FUSE
###755 TO THE INSIDE OF PETALS. AND THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE THE
###759 FLOWER HERE. YOU CAN'T SEE IT. BUT THAT SORT OF FUSION OF LIKE
###763 
###763 PARTS AND UNLIKE PARTS CAN HELP TO INTEGRATE THE FLOWER IN A WAY
###768 THAT IT FUNCTIONS AS A WHOLE VERY EFFECTIVELY DURING POLLINATION
###773 AND CAN ALLOW FOR MORE PRECISE, ACCURATE PLACEMENT OF POLLEN ON A
###777 POLLINATOR. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, A POLLINATOR LANDS ON THE THROAT OF
###780 THIS FLOWER AND DEPRESSES THAT LOWER LIP AND THAT'S GOING TO
###785 CAUSE THE STAMENS ABOVE TO COME DOWN ON TOP OF THE BACK OF THE
###789 POLLINATOR AND DEPOSIT POLLEN OR THE STIGMA TO COME DOWN AND PICK
###792 UP POLLEN. THOUGH THAT CAN GO HAND-IN-HAND WITH REDUCTION IN
###797 NUMBER OF PARTS BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE MORE ACCURACY AND PRECISION
###801 IN YOUR POLLEN PLACEMENT AND POLLEN REMOVAL, YOU DON'T NEED
###804 NECESSARILY, FOR EXAMPLE, AS MANY STAMENS. THAT'S SO THESE
###809 KINDS, THESE TRAITS, THESE TRENDS CAN GO TOGETHER IN SOME CASES.
###816 ANOTHER TREND THAT WE SEE IS A SHIFT FROM RADIAL SYMMETRY WHERE
###820 WE HAVE BASICALLY LIKE A PIE WHERE YOU CAN CUT IT IN ANY, IN ANY
###827 DIRECTION AND GET TWO EQUAL HALVES, RADIAL SYMMETRY, AS OPPOSED
###832 TO BILATERAL SYMMETRY LIKE US WHERE YOU CAN ONLY CUT US IN HALF
###835 IN ONE PLANE AND GET TWO EQUAL HALVES. AND THAT'S WHAT WE SEE
###838 IN THIS FOXGLOVE AS WELL AS IN THIS ORCHID WHERE THAT'S THE ONLY
###842 PLANE IN WHICH WE COULD CUT THIS FLOWER AND GET TWO EQUAL HALVES.
###848 AND WE GET THIS BILATERAL SYMMETRY EVOLVING IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT
###853 GROUPS, THE FLOWERING PLANTS, AND IT OFTEN GOES ALONG REALLY WELL
###857 WITH SPECIALIZATION IN POLLINATOR, IN POLLINATION WITH PARTICULAR
###862 POLLINATORS. SO IT ALSO PROMOTES PRECISION AND ACCURACY OF
###868 POLLEN PLACEMENT. IN THE CASE OF ORCHIDS, MOST ORCHIDS ONLY
###872 HAVE A SINGLE STAMEN. SO THEY'VE GONE DOWN TO A SINGLE STAMEN,
###876 
###877 AND THEY TRANSFER ALL THEIR POLLEN AT ONCE WITH THAT SINGLE
###881 STAMEN. THOUGH THERE'S, THAT'S A REPEATED TREND AND THESE
###885 GROUPS THAT SHOW BILATERAL SYMMETRY OF FLOWERS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY
###890 HIGHER DIVERSITY THAN GROUPS THAT DON'T. THAT'S BEEN SHOWN IN A
###894 NUMBER, THERE'S ENOUGH DIFFERENT PLANT FAMILIES WHERE THAT'S
###897 EVOLVED THAT IT'S BEEN, WE CAN DO COMPARATIVE STUDIES AND MAKE A
###901 RIGOROUS CASE FOR AN INCREASED DIVERSITY WHEN YOU EVOLVE THIS
###905 KIND OF SPECIALIZATION. AND ANOTHER TREND THAT WE SEE HAPPENING
###912 OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS ADDITIONAL PROTECTION OF THE OVARY, OF THE
###917 OVULES. AND REMEMBER THE OVULES ARE ALREADY CONTAINED WITHIN AN
###920 OVARY IN FLOWERING PLANTS UNLIKE IN GYMNOSPERMS WHICH PROVIDE
###924 SOME PROTECTION FROM HERBIVORES, FROM DRYING OUT IN THE, WITH
###931 REGARD TO ABIOTIC FACTORS, ET CETERA. AND IN SOME FLOWERING
###936 PLANTS, OTHER FLORAL WHORLS LIKE THE PERIANTH, THE, THE PETALS
###941 AND SEPALS, THE BASES OF THE STAMENS CAN FORM A FLORAL TUBE THAT
###946 FUSES AROUND THE OVARY OR THE OVARY CAN ACTUALLY BECOME EMBEDDED
###951 IN THE TIP OF THE STEM LIKE IN A CACTUS HERE. AND WE CAN HAVE
###955 TISSUE IN ADDITION TO THE OVARY FUSED AROUND AND PROTECTING THE
###960 OVULES. SO THE OVARY IS WHAT WE CALL INFERIOR IN THIS CASE
###963 BECAUSE IT'S LOOKS LIKE IT'S ACTUALLY DEPRESSED DOWN INTO THE
###968 STEM WHICH IT ACTUALLY IS IN CACTI, BUT IN MOST PLANTS THAT HAVE
###971 AN INFERIOR OVARY, IT'S THE OTHER OUTSIDE PARTS OF THE FLOWER
###974 THAT FUSE AROUND THE OVARY. BUT THOSE ARE JUST DETAILS. BUT
###978 THE MAIN POINT IS THAT THERE'S OTHER TISSUE IN ADDITION TO OVARY
###983 TISSUE THAT SURROUNDS THE, THE OVULES THAT'S FUSED TO THE
###986 
###986 OVARIES, TO THE OVARY. AND YOU ONLY GET A SINGLE OVARY IN CASES
###992 LIKE THAT. OKAY, SO NOW THE LIFE CYCLE OF ANGIOSPERMS IS PRETTY
###998 SIMILAR TO THE GYMNSPERMS, THE OTHER SEED PLANTS, BUT THERE'S
###1001 SOME REALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES THAT MAKE A LOT OF SENSE IN
###1005 TERMS OF HOW THESE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BENEFICIAL TO SUCCESS OF
###1011 ANGIOSPERMS. SO LET'S LOOK AT THE POLLEN DEVELOPMENT FIRST.
###1017 AND THIS IS A DIAGRAM FROM YOUR TEXTBOOK. AND JUST LIKE IN THE
###1022 GYMNOSPERMS WE HAVE THE MICROSPOROGENESIS. WE HAVE MICROSPORES
###1026 FORMED IN MICROSPORANGIA WHICH, THROUGH MEIOSIS. THIS IS, THESE
###1033 ARE POLLEN SACS AS WE CALL THEM, BUT THEY'RE MICROSPORANGIA.
###1038 AND HERE YOU CAN SEE THE FOUR PRODUCTS OF MEIOSIS. AND THE MALE
###1044 GAMETOPHYTE THEN, OF COURSE THE MICROSPORE GERMINATES, UNDERGOES
###1047 MITOTIC DIVISIONS, ALREADY HAPLOID LIKE ANY OTHER SPORE. AND
###1053 THE GAMETOPHYTE'S HAPLOID. BUT AT THE TIME OF DISPERSAL THE MALE
###1059 GAMETOPHYTE USUALLY CONSISTS OF ONLY TWO CELLS, A TUBE CELL THAT
###1063 WILL DIRECT THE GROWTH OF THE POLLEN TUBE AND A GENERATIVE CELL
###1068 THAT WILL UNDERGO ANOTHER MITOTIC DIVISION TO PRODUCE TWO SPERM
###1073 CELLS. THOUGH THIS IS THE BEAR MINIMUM NUMBER OF CELLS THAT
###1077 THIS MALE GAMETOPHYTE NEEDS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY. IT HAS TO HAVE
###1082 A TUBE CELL IN ORDER TO PRODUCE THE POLLEN TUBE TO GROW DOWN
###1085 THROUGH THE STYLE AND REACH THE OVULES IN THE OVARY. AND IT
###1090 NEEDS BOTH OF THOSE SPERM CELLS, OKAY, UNLIKE IN THE GYMNOSPERMS
###1095 THAT ONLY NEED ONE OF THEIR SPERM CELLS, ANGIOSPERMS NEED BOTH OF
###1099 THE SPERM CELLS OF THE MALE GAMETOPHYTE. WE'LL GET INTO THAT IN
###1102 A MINUTE. THAT'S ANOTHER IMPORTANT INNOVATION WE'LL GET TO.
###1105 
###1108 OKAY, BUT FIRST LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE.
###1111 REMEMBER IN THE GYMNOSPERMS THE FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE IS A FAIRLY,
###1114 IT'S TAKES UP THE MAJORITY OF THE SEED AND IS THE MAIN NUTRITIVE
###1119 TISSUE FOR THE DEVELOPING EMBRYO AFTER IT DEVELOP, AFTER
###1125 FERTILIZATION OF THE EGG. SO IN THE CASE OF THE FLOWERING
###1130 PLANTS, THE FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE, IT'S NOT THIS LARGE MULTICELLULAR
###1134 GAMETOPHYTE OR I SAID LARGE, YOU KNOW, FAIR-, RELATIVELY
###1138 SPEAKING, BUT MORE CELLS THAN YOU'D CARE TO COUNT THAT'S FOR SURE
###1142 IN THE CASE OF THE GYMNOSPERM FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE. AND THE
###1146 PRESENCE USUALLY OF MULTIPLE ARCHEGONIA IN THE GYMNOSPERM FEMALE
###1151 GAMETOPHYTE REMEMBER WHERE THE EGGS ARE FOUND. BUT IN THE
###1154 FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE OF ANGIOSPERMS, THE MATURE FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE
###1159 ONLY CONSISTS USUALLY OF ABOUT SEVEN CELLS AND EIGHT NUCLEI.
###1166 ONE OF THE CELLS, THE CENTRAL CELL, THE LARGEST HAS TWO NUCLEI,
###1169 WHAT ARE CALLED THE POLAR NUCLEI. BUT HERE YOU CAN SEE THE
###1173 OPENING IN THE OVULE HERE WHERE THE POLLEN TUBE WILL ENTER. AND
###1179 THERE'S VERY LITTLE TO THIS FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE. THERE ARE THREE
###1181 CELLS UP AT THE BACK END OF THE OVULE, THE ANTIPODAL SO-CALLED,
###1187 THESE TWO POLAR NUCLEI IN THE BIG CENTRAL CELL. AND HERE'S THE
###1190 EGG AGAIN CLOSE TO THE OPENING IN THE OVULE, THE MICROPYLAR END.
###1196 AND IT'S FLANKED BY TWO INDIVIDUAL CELLS, ONE ON EITHER SIDE,
###1199 THAT ARE CALLED SYNERGIDS. NOT IMPORTANT BUT THESE MAY BE THE
###1203 VESTIGES OF AN ARCHEGONIUM. BUT THERE'S REALLY NO CLEAR
###1207 ARCHEGONIUM PRESENT, NO GAMETANGIUM, YOU KNOW SAC THAT CONTAINS
###1213 THE GAMETES. JUST LIKE IN THE POLLEN, THEY'VE LOST THE
###1217 
###1217 GAMETANGIUM. SO THE ANGIOSPERMS DON'T HAVE EITHER FEMALE OR
###1221 MALE GAMETANGIA IN THEIR GAMETOPHYTES. THOSE ARE THE REALLY
###1226 STRIPPED DOWN FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE AND THE SUPER STRIPPED DOWN MALE
###1231 GAMETOPHYTE AS WELL AS IN THE ANGIOSPERMS. SO A PRETTY MINOR
###1234 INVESTMENT HERE COMPARED TO THE WHAT THE GYMNOSPERMS MAKE IN
###1238 THEIR GAMETOPHYTES. ALL RIGHT, SO FERTILIZATION, WE TALKED
###1244 ABOUT POLLINATION LAST TIME OF ANGIOSPERMS WHERE THE POLLEN'S
###1249 DEPOSITED NOT ON THE OVULE ITSELF LIKE IN GYMNOSPERMS, BUT AT THE
###1253 STIGMATIC AREA, ON THE STIGMA. AND WE TALKED ABOUT HOW THE
###1258 POLLEN TUBES HAVE TO GROW DOWN THROUGH THE STYLE TO REACH THE
###1262 OVULES. AND ONCE THAT OCCURS, THE POLLEN TUBES GROW IN THROUGH
###1269 THE MICROPYLAR END, AS THEY DO IN GYMNOSPERMS. AND WE HAVE
###1276 FERTILIZATION OF THE EGG BY ONE OF THE SPERM CELLS. AND THERE'S
###1280 NEVER ANY FLAGELLAE ON THE, I THINK I ALREADY MENTIONED THERE'S
###1284 NO FLAGELLUM ON THE SPERM AND ANGIOSPERMS. THEY'RE DELIVERED
###1287 RIGHT TO THE, TO THE FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE BY THE POLLEN TUBE. SO
###1293 THAT'S NOTHING NEW IN TERMS OF A ZYGOTE BEING FORMED. BUT THE
###1296 OTHER SPERM, THE SECOND SPERM PRODUCED BY THE POLLEN TUBE, ALSO
###1303 UNDERGOES FUSION NOT WITH THE EGG BUT WITH THOSE TWO POLAR NUCLEI
###1308 IN THE CENTRAL CELL. AND SO YOU END UP WITH THIS TRIPLOID
###1312 NUCLEUS. AND THIS WILL NOW UNDERGO A LOT OF FREE NUCLEAR
###1316 DIVISIONS WITHOUT THE FORMATION OF CELL MEMBRANES AND CELL WALLS
###1322 SEPARATING THEM FROM ONE ANOTHER INITIALLY. AND THEN IT'LL START
###1326 WALLING OFF THOSE NUCLEI. SO WE GO FROM THIS MILKY ENDOSPERM TO
###1332 A CELLULAR ENDOSPERM. NOW THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS, SO WHAT
###1336 
###1336 HAPPENS IS AFTER THE ZYGOTE FORMS AND THIS ENDOSPERM FORMS, WE
###1340 START GETTING A LOT OF ACTIVITY OF THIS ENDOSPERM TISSUE. IT
###1346 STARTS RAPIDLY DEVELOPING REALLY BEFORE THE ZYGOTE'S DOING
###1350 ANYTHING. SO WE'RE INVESTING IN WHAT BECOMES THE NUTRITIVE
###1354 TISSUE. THE ENDOSPERM BECOMES THE NUTRITIVE TISSUE FOR THE
###1357 EMBRYO, THE DEVELOPING EMBRYO. THOUGH THE IMPORTANT THING TO
###1361 CONSIDER HERE IS THAT IN THE GYMNOSPERMS, THERE'S THIS HUGE
###1365 INVESTMENT IN THE FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE, THIS VERY LARGE ORGANISM
###1369 INSIDE THE SEED RELATIVE TO THE SIZE OF THE FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE IN
###1375 ANGIOSPERMS. BUT IN THE CASE OF, BUT IF IT DOESN'T GET, IF THE
###1381 EGG DOESN'T GET FERTILIZED IN A GYMNOSPERM, ALL THAT INVESTMENT
###1385 IS A BIG WASTE OF RESOURCES FOR THE PARENT SPOROPHYTE THAT
###1388 PRODUCED THOSE OVULES BECAUSE THAT FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE AND THE
###1393 GYMNOSPERM IS PARASITIC ON THE, ON THE SPOROPHYTE THAT GAVE BIRTH
###1397 TO IT. SO THAT'S A REAL PROB-, OR THAT'S A POTENTIAL PROBLEM IN
###1403 TERMS OF WASTAGE THAT ANGIOSPERMS GET AROUND BY WAITING TO INVEST
###1408 IN THE NUTRITIVE TISSUE FOR THEIR DEVELOPING EMBRYOS UNTIL AFTER
###1411 FERTILIZATION HAPPENS. SO ANGIOSPERMS WAIT AND THEN START
###1418 DEVELOPING THE NUTRITIVE TISSUE, THIS ENDOSPERM. AND IF YOU'VE
###1423 EVER BROKEN OPEN A COCONUT, WHICH COCONUTS HAVE THE WORLD'S
###1427 LARGEST SEED SO THIS IS EASY TO SEE, THE MILK INSIDE THE COCONUT
###1433 IS THE ACELLULAR ENDOSPERM, SO THAT'S THE FREE NUCLEI FLOATING IN
###1438 CYTOPLASM WHERE WE HAVEN'T YET HAD CELL WALLS FORM. WHEREAS THE
###1442 MEAT OF THE COCONUT THAT LINES THE INSIDE OF THE SEED, THAT'S THE
###1445 CELLULAR ENDOSPERM THAT, WHERE WE HAVE HAD CELL MEMBRANES AND
###1450 
###1450 CELL WALLS PARTITION OFF THE NUCLEI. AND THE EMBRYO'S REALLY
###1453 JUST A TINY LITTLE THING THAT YOU HAVE TO BREAK OPEN THE, YOU
###1458 HAVE TO DIG AROUND IN THE CELLULAR ENDOSPERM TO LOCATE. SO
###1465 THAT'S, GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT FOR ENDOSPERM. SO ARE
###1468 THERE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT DOUBLE FERTILIZATION THEN? OKAY, SO IN
###1476 THE END THEN AN ANGIOSPERM SEED -- YEAH?
###1481 STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
###1484 PROFESSOR: THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. YEAH, WELL, THAT'S, THAT'S
###1487 EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GET TO RIGHT NOW. IT'S REALLY
###1490 UNCLEAR TO BE FRANK ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF WHETHER THE TRIPLOIDY OF
###1495 THOSE NUCLEI, YOU KNOW, HAS ANY NUTRITIVE BENEFIT TO THE EMBRYO
###1499 OR NOT. BUT IT IS STILL A CLEAR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT YOU SEE
###1504 IN AN ANGIOSPERM SEED VERSUS A GYNOPSPERM SEED. HERE'S A CARTOON
###1509 OF AN ANGIOSPERM SEED. AGAIN WE HAVE THIS DIPLOID EMBRYO, THE
###1513 YOUNG SPOROPHYTE. WE HAVE THE TRIPLOID ENDOSPERM THAT FORMS THE
###1519 NUTRITIVE TISSUE FROM, DEVELOPED AFTER FERTILIZATION WITH THAT
###1523 SECOND SPERM FUSING TO THE POLAR NUCLEI. AND THEN WE HAVE
###1528 DIPLOID SEED COAT TISSUE FROM THE INTEGUMENT THAT WAS PRODUCED
###1531 AROUND THE OVULE BY THE PARENT SPOROPHYTE THAT MADE THE OVULE.
###1536 AND IN CONTRAST IN THE GYMNOSPERM WE HAVE BASICALLY THE SAME
###1541 ARRANGEMENT EXCEPT FOR THE NUTRITIVE TISSUE HERE IS HAPLOID, IT'S
###1544 FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE TISSUE. WHEREAS THE FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE, IT'S
###1549 RELATIVELY INSIGNIFICANT IN TERMS OF ITS NUTRITIVE VALUE TO THE
###1553 EMBRYO COMPARED TO THE ENDOSPERM. OKAY? THOUGH THIS INVESTMENT
###1561 WAS MADE BEFORE FERTILIZATION. THIS INVESTMENT WAS MADE AFTER
###1565 
###1565 FERTILIZATION IN THAT NUTRITIVE TISSUE. ALL RIGHT, SO ANOTHER
###1571 INNOVATION THAT MAY HELP TO EXPLAIN SUCCESS OF ANGIOSPERMS IN
###1576 PART IS THE EVOLUTION OF FRUIT. AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT FRUITING
###1581 BODIES IN MUSHROOMS. BUT THAT'S SHORTHAND. STRICTLY
###1585 BOTANICALLY SPEAKING, THE ONLY REAL FRUIT IS PRODUCED BY
###1590 ANGIOSPERMS. AND FRUIT HAS REAL VALUE TO ANGIOSPERMS IN TERMS OF
###1596 PROMOTING DISPERSAL OF SEEDS. SO WE TALKED ABOUT DIFFERENT
###1600 POLLINATION SPECIALIZATIONS, THESE DIFFERENT POLLINATION
###1603 SYNDROMES, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT PROMOTE DISPERSAL OF POLLEN WHICH IS
###1608 ONE WAY IN WHICH ANGIOSPERMS CAN GET THEIR GENES AROUND IS BY
###1612 MOVING AROUND THE MALE GAMETOPHYTES WHICH ARE MOBILE RELATIVE TO
###1616 THE REST OF THE LIFE CYCLE. THE OTHER STAGE OF THE LIFE CYCLE
###1620 THAT'S MOBILE ARE THE SEEDS. AND SO FRUIT IS AN INNOVATION OF
###1625 ANGIOSPERMS THAT PROMOTES DISPERSAL OF SEEDS. AND BASICALLY
###1632 SPEAKING A FRUIT IN ITS STRICTEST SENSE IS JUST A RIPENED OVARY.
###1637 SO REMEMBER THE OVARY IS THE BASE OF THE PISTAL, THE CHAMBER IN
###1641 WHICH THE SEED OR, THE OVULE OR OVULES ARE LOCATED. AND AT
###1649 MATURITY THE RIPENED OVARY BECOMES ALL OR PART OF THE FRUIT.
###1654 SOMETIMES THERE ARE ADDITIONAL TISSUES THAT MAKE UP THE DISPERSAL
###1658 UNIT OF THE FRUIT. SOMETIMES THE FRUIT ISN'T THE DISPERSAL UNIT
###1662 BUT IT IS STILL THE RIPENED OVARY, AND WE'LL GET TO THAT IN A
###1670 SECOND, THAT IS, ANGIOSPERMS CAN DIRECTLY RELEASE THEIR SEEDS AND
###1673 THE SEEDS CAN BE DISPERSAL UNITS, BUT OFTEN THE FRUIT IS THE
###1676 DISPERSAL UNIT CONTAINING THE SEEDS. SO THERE'S A LOT OF
###1681 CLASSIFICATION THAT HAS REVOLVED AROUND DESCRIBING DIFFERENT
###1685 
###1685 TYPES OF FRUITS. AND THE IMPORTANT THING TO REALIZE HERE IS
###1688 THAT THE CLASSIFICATION OF FRUITS IS NOT A NATURAL
###1691 CLASSIFICATION, THAT IS IT DOESN'T REFLECT PHYLOGENY. THESE
###1696 DIFFERENT SO-CALLED TYPES OF FRUITS ARE CONVENIENT WAYS OF
###1700 CLASSIFYING FRUITS THAT HELP TO UNDERSTAND THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE
###1705 FRUITS, AND THE ANATOMY OF FRUITS AND CAN ALSO BE BENEFICIAL IN
###1710 UNDERSTANDING DISPERSAL. BUT THEY'RE NOT, THESE DIFFERENT TYPES
###1714 OF FRUITS HAVE EVOLVED MULTIPLE TIMES IN DIFFERENT GROUPS OF
###1720 FLOWERING PLANTS. AND THE MOST WIDESPREAD TYPE OF FRUIT IN THIS
###1724 THREE, THREE-TYPE CLASSIFICATION I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT HERE
###1727 BRIEFLY IS IN YOUR TEXTBOOK IS CALLED A SIMPLE FRUIT. AND A
###1731 SIMPLE FRUIT'S A GOOD NAME FOR IT BECAUSE IT SIMPLY IS A FRUIT
###1735 DERIVED FROM ONE IS OVARY. THOUGH IT'S BASICALLY DERIVED FROM
###1740 ONE OVARY OF ONE FLOWER. THAT OVARY MIGHT BE FROM ONE CARPEL OR
###1745 FROM MULTIPLE CARPELS THAT WERE FUSED TOGETHER INTO A COMPOUND
###1748 PISTIL, BUT IT'S FROM ONE PISTIL REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THAT
###1752 PISTIL IS FROM ONE OR MORE CARPELS FUSED TOGETHER. AND A
###1758 CHERRY, APRICOT, THESE ARE GREAT EXAMPLES OF SIMPLE FRUITS THAT
###1762 ARE FLESHY FRUITS OBVIOUSLY, ALTHOUGH THE PIT OF THE CHERRY, THE
###1765 PIT OF THE APRICOT IS ALSO A FRUIT WALL THAT PROTECTS THE SEED
###1769 INSIDE. THERE ARE DIFFERENT WALLS OF, DIFFERENT LAYERS OF FRUIT
###1775 THAT CAN BE REALLY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER. AND FRUITS CAN
###1778 BE DEHISCENT OR INDEHISCENT, THAT IS FRUITS CAN OPEN UP AT
###1783 MATURITY AND RELEASE THE SEEDS DIRECTLY IN WHICH CASE THE SEED IS
###1786 GENERALLY THE DISPERSAL UNIT, OR THE FRUIT CAN REMAIN FUSED
###1791 
###1791 AROUND THE, OR IT CAN REMAIN, IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY OPEN BY SOME
###1795 SORT OF SUTURE AND SURROUNDS THE SEEDS IN WHICH CASE THE WHOLE
###1799 FRUIT IS TYPICALLY THE DISPERSAL UNIT ALONG WITH THE SEEDS. SO
###1811 ANOTHER TYPE OF FRUIT THEN IS AN AGGREGATE FRUIT, THE SECOND OF
###1815 THESE THREE MAJOR TYPES THAT YOUR BOOK DESCRIBES. AND AN
###1819 AGGREGATE FRUIT IS SOMETHING LIKE A RASPBERRY OR A BLACKBERRY
###1823 THAT IS A FRUIT DERIVED FROM MORE THAN ONE SEPARATE CARPEL OF ONE
###1826 FLOWER. SO SEPARATE PISTILS, EACH FROM ONE CARPEL YOU CAN SEE
###1833 ARE THESE LITTLE, EACH ONE OF THESE LITTLE FRUITLETS THAT MAKES
###1837 UP A RASPBERRY OR BLACKBERRY IS AN INDIVIDUAL PISTIL FROM ONE
###1843 CARPEL THAT ARE, THEY'RE SEPARATE BUT THEY'RE STILL BASICALLY
###1850 PART OF A COMMON DISPERSAL UNIT HERE. THE WHOLE, THE WHOLE
###1855 AGGREGATE FRUIT IS REMOVED AS A UNIT TYPICALLY, BY AN ANIMAL AND
###1859 DISPERSED. SO THAT'S ONE, ANOTHER TYPE OF, OF FRUIT THAT'S
###1866 STILL IS FROM A SINGLE FLOWER BUT FROM MULTIPLE PISTILS. AND
###1874 ANOTHER TYPE OF FRUIT IS A MULTIPLE FRUIT. AND A MULTIPLE FRUIT
###1878 IS A FRUIT DERIVED FROM MULTIPLE FLOWERS. AND THIS IS A CASE IN
###1883 THE PINEAPPLE WHERE YOU HAVE CLEARLY DISTINCT FLOWERS INITIALLY.
###1888 I MEAN THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY DISTINCT AT THIS POINT IN THEIR, IN
###1892 THEIR DEVELOPMENT. AND THEN AFTER, AFTER WE'VE HAD
###1896 FERTILIZATION AND SEED DEVELOPMENT, THE FRUIT'S DEVELOPING HERE.
###1901 AND EVENTUALLY ALL OF THESE FLOWERS COALESCE TOGETHER INTO ONE
###1906 BIG DISPERSAL UNIT, ONE LARGE PINEAPPLE WHERE EACH OF THE LITTLE
###1910 SEGMENTS THAT YOU SEE, THOSE LITTLE WALLED-OFF UNITS IN THE
###1915 PINEAPPLE REPRESENT INDIVIDUAL FLOWERS OF A COMMON INFLORESCENCE
###1919 
###1919 OF AN ENTIRE ARRAY, A COMPACT ARRAY OF FLOWERS. ANOTHER GREAT
###1924 EXAMPLE OF THIS KIND OF FLOWER OR THIS KIND OF FRUIT IS A
###1927 MULBERRY WHICH LOOKS A LOT SUPERFICIALLY LIKE SOMETHING LIKE A
###1932 RASPBERRY BUT IT'S ACTUALLY MULTIPLE FLOWERS THAT MAKE UP THAT,
###1936 THAT STRUCTURE. AND HERE AGAIN, THE SIMPLE FRUIT, THE AGGREGATE
###1942 FRUIT, THE MULTIPLE FRUIT. FRUITS CAN BE EITHER DRY, THEY DON'T
###1946 HAVE TO BE FLESHY. FRUITS CAN BE DRY ALTOGETHER. LIKE A PEAPOD
###1952 AT MATURITY, IT DRIES OUT, SPLITS OPEN, AND RELEASES THE SEEDS.
###1957 THOUGH FRUIT IS JUST A MATURE OVARY. IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE
###1962 TO BE THE DISPERSAL UNIT BUT IT OFTEN IS. AND EVEN IF IT IS, IF
###1966 IT IS THE DISPERSAL UNIT, IT CAN BE DRY OR FLESHY, AS WE'LL LOOK
###1971 AT HERE IN A MINUTE. ONE LAST TYPE OF FRUIT TO MENTION IS THIS
###1979 ACCESSORY FRUIT. AND THIS IS KIND OF A COOL THING TO THINK ABOUT
###1982 BECAUSE IN ACCESSORY FRUITS, THE RIPENED OVARY IS PART OF THE
###1989 FRUIT BUT IT'S NOT THE FLESHY PART. THERE'S ANOTHER FLESHY PART
###1993 THAT'S DERIVED FROM OTHER PARTS OF EITHER THE FLOWER OR THE
###1997 INFLORESCENCE. AND THERE ARE ACCESSORY FRUITS THAT FALL IN THE
###2001 CATEGORY OF SIMPLE, AGGREGATE, AND MULTIPLE. SO THIS IS A, SO
###2006 SIMPLE AGG-, SIMPLE, AGGREGATE, AND MULTIPLE FRUITS CAN ALSO BE
###2009 ACCESSORY FRUITS WHEREAS I MENTIONED THE FRUIT HAS FLESHY PARTS
###2014 THAT ARE DERIVED FROM, LARGELY FROM TISSUES OTHER THAN THE OVARY.
###2018 AND AN APPLE'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS. SO HERE'S THE STALK OF
###2022 THE APPLE FLOWER, WHERE THE FLOWER WAS ATTACHED. AND HERE'S
###2027 WHAT'S LEFT OF THE, OF THE SEPALS, THE STAMENS, AND THE, THE
###2033 STYLES OF AN APPLE. AND YOU'VE KNOW DOUBT SEEN THOSE AT THE
###2036 
###2036 SUMMIT OF AN APPLE. SO THE OVARY IS RIGHT HERE. THE OVARY IS
###2041 THE CORE OF THE APPLE, THE PAPERY PART THAT YOU GENERALLY DON'T
###2045 EAT BUT THROW ASIDE. AND THE, THE REALLY JUICY CHOICE PART OF
###2050 THE APPLE, THIS OUTER PART IS ACCESSORY TISSUE. IT'S ACTUALLY
###2055 THE FLORAL TUBE FORMED FROM THE BASIS OF THE SEPALS, PETALS, AND
###2059 STAMENS THAT HAVE FUSED TOGETHER AND FUSED AROUND THE OVARY. SO
###2064 THE OVARY IS INFERIOR LIKE WE MENTIONED BEFORE. IT'S PROTECTED
###2067 BY THIS TISSUE. AND DISPERSAL AGENT COMING AND GRABBING AN
###2073 APPLE OR EATING AN APPLE IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE CONSUMING MOSTLY
###2077 THIS EXTERNAL PART AND LEAVING THE CORE AND THE SEEDS. THOUGH
###2082 THE ACCESSORY TISSUE'S IMPORTANT IN DISPERSAL AND IT'S NOT PART
###2086 OF THE OVARY. THE OVARY CAN BE SPARED FROM BEING EATEN AND THE
###2090 SEEDS AS WELL, BUT IT CAN GET MOVED AWAY FROM THE PARENT PLANT.
###2095 THE STRAWBERRY'S ANOTHER TYPE OF ACCESSORY FRUIT THAT'S AN
###2097 AGGREGATE. AND THE LITTLE GRAINY INCLUSIONS ON THE OUTSIDE OF A
###2103 STRAWBERRY, THOSE ARE THE OVARIES. SO THE OVARIES ARE LITTLE DRY
###2106 INDEHISCENT FRUITS THAT WE CALL ACHENES. THE TERM'S NOT
###2110 IMPORTANT, BUT THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY, THEY DON'T OPEN AT MATURITY.
###2113 THEY CONTAIN A SINGLE SEED EACH. AND THE ACTUAL FLESHY PART OF
###2118 A STRAWBERRY IS THE RECEPTACLE OF THE FLOWER, WHICH IS BASICALLY
###2122 THE PODIUM ON WHICH THE OTHER PARTS OF THE FLOWER ARE BORNE.
###2126 AND IT'S USUALLY NOT AN ENLARGED STRUCTURE. IT'S PRETTY
###2128 INSIGNIFICANT. WE DIDN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT IT BEFORE. IT'S JUST
###2132 THE TIP OF THE STEM THAT THE FLOWER'S BORNE ON, BUT IT BECOMES
###2137 THE FLESHY PART OF THE FRUIT THAT'S THE ATTRACTANT FOR ANIMAL
###2141 
###2141 DISPERSAL HERE. AND HERE YOU CAN SEE THE SEPALS. AND IN A FIG,
###2148 THE FLESHY PART OF THE FRUIT IS BASICALLY THE WHOLE
###2150 INFLORESCENCE. THE FIG INFLORESCENCE IS LIKE AN INFLORESCENCE
###2154 TURNED INSIDE OUT. AND THE, ALL THE FLESHY JUICY PART IS MOSTLY
###2161 NON-FLORAL TISSUE. SO IT'S THE WHOLE INFLORESCENCE. THOUGH
###2166 THERE'S A LOT OF INNOVATION AND DIVERSITY IN FRUIT MORPHOLOGY.
###2174 AND IN DIFFERENT GROUP OF PLANTS THEY'VE GONE IN FOR VERY
###2178 DIFFERENT KINDS OF WAYS OF ATTRACTING POLLINATORS AND DISPERSING
###2185 THEIR, THEIR SEEDS VIA DIFFERENT FRUIT INNOVATIONS. AND SOME OF
###2189 THESE ARE SHOWN HERE. NOW THIS IS DISPERSAL BY WIND AND WATER.
###2194 SO NON-ANIMAL DISPERSAL. AND THERE'S A REALLY WIDE RANGE OF
###2200 ADAPTATIONS TO NON-ANIMAL DISPERSAL, TO WIND AND WATER DISPERSAL,
###2203 OR ABIOTIC DISPERSAL IN ANGIOSPERMS. AND SOME OF THESE ARE LIKE
###2208 IN GYMNOSPERMS WHERE THE FRUIT OPENS UP AT MATURITY AND RELEASES
###2213 THE SEEDS, AND THE SEEDS MIGHT BE WINGED OR HAVE A TUFT OF HAIR
###2217 ON THEM THAT MAKES THEM DISPERSABLE BY WIND FOR EXAMPLE, LIKE
###2221 THIS WINGED GOURD SEED HERE. SO SIMILAR TO SAY A PINE SEED.
###2228 WHERE THE SEED'S THE DISPERSAL UNIT. BUT IN OTHER CASES THE
###2231 FRUIT IS DISPERSED IN THE WIND. FOR EXAMPLE, IN A MAPLE, THERE
###2236 ARE WINGS ON THE FRUIT, THIS KIND OF FRUIT WE CALL SAMARA THAT
###2239 BLOWS IN THE WIND. AND IN SOMETHING LIKE A DANDELION, YOU'VE NO
###2243 DOUBT SEEN THE FRUITS. THE FRUITS ARE ACTUALLY DRY, INDEHISCENT
###2247 STRUCTURES THAT ARE ATTACHED TO THE SEPALS WHICH ARE PERSISTENT,
###2252 AND THE SEPALS BECOME PARACHUTE-LIKE AND CARRY THE FRUIT ALONG IN
###2257 THE WIND, VERY BUOYANT. AND IN SOME PLANTS THE ENTIRE PLANT IS
###2264 
###2264 THE, IS A WIND DISPERSAL UNIT LIKE THE TUMBLEWEED WHERE IT BREAKS
###2268 OFF AT THE BASE AT MATURITY AFTER IT DRIES OUT. THE OUTLINE OF
###2272 THE WHOLE PLANT IS SPHERICAL, AND IT JUST BLOWS IN THE WIND
###2275 CARRYING ALL THE FRUITS WITH IT. SO THERE ARE DIFFERENT UNITS
###2279 OF DISPERSAL FROM THE SMALLEST UNIT, THE SEED, TO THE ENTIRE
###2283 PLANT. CACTI ARE ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHERE ENTIRE STEMS CAN BE
###2289 DISPERSED BY IMPALING AN ANIMAL'S LEG WITH THE SPINES OF THE
###2293 CACTUS AND CARRYING THE FRUIT ALONG WITH IT LIKE IN THE SO-CALLED
###2297 JUMPING CHOLLA DOWN IN OUR DESERTS HERE WHICH ARE PRETTY
###2300 DANGEROUS TO WALK AROUND FOR THAT REASON. AND ALSO YOU CAN GET
###2305 DISPERSAL BY WATER. A LOT OF DIFFERENT TROPICAL, ESPECIALLY
###2308 PLANTS, A LOT OF OUR ISLAND PLANTS IF YOU GO TO THE HAWAIIAN
###2312 ISLANDS OR TAHITI, SOME OF THE TROPICAL ISLANDS, RIGHT ALONG THE
###2317 EDGE OF THE WATER YOU'LL FIND A LOT OF PLANTS THAT HAVE DISPERSAL
###2319 ADAPTATIONS TO WATER, WHICH HAVE BUOYANT FRUITS LIKE THE COCONUT.
###2325 AND THESE FRUITS HAVE HARD SEED LAYERS OR FRUIT LAYERS THAT
###2329 PREVENT THE, THE SEED FROM BEING PENETRATED BY SALT WATER UNTIL
###2337 AFTER DISPERSAL. SO THIS IS ANOTHER WAY IN WHICH PLANTS CAN GET
###2341 AROUND. THOUGH AS I MENTIONED HERE, YOU KNOW JUST AS FLOWERS
###2345 HAVE EVOLVED IN RESPONSE TO POLLINATORS, FRUITS HAVE EVOLVED IN
###2349 RESPONSE TO DISPERSAL AGENTS. AND SO WE HAVE THESE, ALL OF
###2353 THESE DISPERSAL, ALL OF THESE MECHANISMS FOR DISPERSING POLLEN IN
###2357 POLLINATION, WE HAVE ALL THESE MECHANISMS FOR DISPERSING SEEDS
###2362 WITH, THAT INVOLVE, OFTEN INVOLVE FRUIT. SO THESE ARE VARIOUS
###2366 IMPORTANT INNOVATIONS OF ANGIOSPERMS. AND AS FAR AS ANIMAL
###2371 
###2371 DISPERSAL GOES, THERE'S A REALLY WIDE DIVERSITY HERE AS WELL.
###2376 SOME DRY FRUITS ARE ANIMAL DISPERSED EITHER INTENTIONALLY LIKE
###2380 ACORNS WHICH CAN BEING PICKED UP BY SQUIRRELS OR BLUEJAYS AND
###2385 CARRIED SOME DISTANCE AND CACHED. AND THEN SOME PROPORTION OF
###2388 THOSE ARE FORGOTTEN ABOUT AND THEY END UP GERMINATING. SOME ARE
###2392 CARRIED LONG DISTANCES. JAYS CAN FLY BETWEEN MOUNTAIN RANGES
###2396 WITH ACORNS IN THEIR, DOWN, CARRIED INSIDE AND REGURGITATED WHEN
###2402 THEY GET TO A NEW AREA. SOME ARE INADVERTENT LIKE BARBED FRUITS.
###2411 AND SOME OF THESE ARE RELATIVELY PAINLESS IN TERMS OF JUST HAVING
###2415 SAY HOOK PRICKLES OR SOMETHING THAT ATTACHES OR STICKY EXUDATES
###2419 THAT ATTACHED TO THE OUTSIDE OF FUR OR FEATHERS AND ARE CARRIED
###2423 FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER INADVERTENTLY. BUT OTHERS ARE MORE
###2429 INSIDIOUS. THE PUNCTURE VINE HAS FRUITS THAT ACTUALLY WILL
###2433 PUNTURE THE FEET OF ANIMALS, INCLUDING PEOPLE IF YOU'RE WALKING
###2437 AROUND BAREFOOT IN THE DESERT, AND REALLY NASTY THINGS THAT YOU
###2441 HAVE TO TAKE SOME EFFORT TO GET OUT AND PRESUMABLY CARRIED SOME
###2445 DISTANCE SOMETIMES BEFORE THEY'RE REMOVED. SOMETIMES AGAIN THE
###2450 SEED IS THE DISPERSAL UNIT. AND LIKE IN THE GOURD I SHOWED YOU
###2454 THAT ARE, THAT'S WIND DISPERSED, SOMETIMES THE SEED HAS SOME
###2457 INTERESTING INNOVATIONS TO PROMOTE DISPERSAL THAT WE DON'T SEE IN
###2461 GYMNOSPERMS, FOR EXAMPLE, LIKE THIS LITTLE FLESHY ATTACHMENT TO
###2468 THE SEED HERE. THE TERM'S AN ELAIOSOME. YOU DON'T HAVE TO
###2471 KNOW THAT, BUT IT'S A LITTLE EDIBLE BODY, HIGH IN OIL OR PROTEIN
###2480 THAT'S ATTACHED TO THE SEED AND MAKES THEM ATTRACTIVE TO ANTS
###2483 WHICH'LL CARRY THEM ACTIVELY TO THEIR NEST SOME DISTANCE AWAY
###2486 
###2486 FROM THE PARENT PLANT. THEY'LL CACHE THESE SEEDS DOWN IN THEIR
###2490 NEST. THEY'LL EAT THE, THE FOOD BODY. AND THEN THEY'LL DISCARD
###2494 THE, THE SEED OR THE SEED WILL REMAIN IN THE NEST AND EVENTUALLY
###2498 GERMINATE. SO THERE ARE SOME, THIS HAS EVOLVED MULTIPLE TIMES IN
###2502 DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PLANTS. AND THEN, OF COURSE, THERE ARE
###2505 FLESHY FRUITS THAT ARE, OR OTHER, OR EVEN DRIED FRUITS THAT ARE
###2508 EATEN DIRECTLY. AND THE FRUIT MAY BE DIGESTED, BUT THE SEED
###2512 ISN'T. IN FACT, THE SEED CAN BE STIMULATED TO GERMINATE BY THE
###2516 CHEMISTRY OF THE GUT AND THEN ENDS UP IN SOME FERTILIZER AT THE
###2521 END OF THE PROCESS AND GERMINATES FROM THAT. SO LOTS OF GREAT
###2528 DISPERSAL ADAPTATIONS. AND JUST ONE FINAL NOTE ABOUT FRUIT IS
###2535 THAT, YOU KNOW WE PROBABLY ALL THINK WE KNOW WHAT FRUIT IS AND
###2537 WHAT VEGETABLES ARE, BUT THESE ARE ALL CLASSIFIED BY U.S. LAW AS
###2543 VEGETABLES. AND YOU CAN SEE SOME THINGS IN HERE THAT ARE
###2547 CLEARLY FRUITS, TOMATOES, FOR EXAMPLE, PEPPERS. THESE ARE
###2551 RIPENED OVARIES THAT CONTAIN SEEDS AS YOU'RE ALL AWARE. BUT
###2557 THEY'RE OFFICIALLY CONSIDERED VEGETABLES BECAUSE THEY HAVE
###2561 SAVOURY RATHER THAN SWEET FLAVOR. AND ACTUALLY THERE WAS A CASE
###2564 THAT WAS TAKEN TO THE SUPREME COURT YEARS AGO BY AN IMPORTER WHO
###2570 WAS BRINGING IN TOMATOES FROM OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY. AND THERE WAS
###2574 A TARIFF ON VEGETABLES AT THE TIME BUT NOT ON FRUIT. AND SO HE
###2579 ARGUED THAT, YOU KNOW, I'M JUST BRINGING FRUIT IN. I'M NOT
###2581 BRINGING IN VEGETABLES. I DON'T HAVE TO PAY THIS TARIFF. AND
###2585 IT WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT. AND THE SUPREME COURT
###2587 RULED THAT YES, WE AGREE THAT BOTANICALLY THE TOMATO IS A FRUIT,
###2592 
###2592 BUT WE RULE IT OFFICIALLY BY U.S. LAW TO BE A VEGETABLE.
###2595 [LAUGHTER] SO, SO THE SUPREME COURT HAD THE LAST WORD ON IT EVEN
###2601 THOUGH, YOU KNOW, THE BOTANISTS HAD TO TAKE SECOND PLACE THERE.
###2605 BUT BOTANICALLY SPEAKING FROM THIS COURSE'S PERSPECTIVE AT LEAST,
###2609 WE'RE GOING TO CONSIDER IT A FRUIT. ALL RIGHT, SO ANGIOSPERM
###2617 DIVERSITY AS I MENTIONED, HUGE ALL OVER THE WORLD. WE'RE STILL
###2622 TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH DIVERSITY'S OUT THERE AND HOW IT'S
###2626 RELATED, HOW THESE DIFFERENT ANGIOSPERMS ARE RELATED TO ONE
###2629 ANOTHER. AND AS I MENTIONED, HOW ANGIOSPERMS ARE RELATED TO
###2634 OTHER SEED PLANTS, GYMNOSPERMS, IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVEN'T
###2638 FIGURED OUT. FOR AWHILE WE THOUGHT WE HAD. IN FACT, LIKE TEN
###2642 YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS TEACHING MY UPPER DIVERSION SYSTEMATICS
###2645 COURSE, IT WAS DOGMA THAT THE ANGIOSPERMS WERE THE CLOSEST
###2648 RELATIVES OF THE GNETOPHYTES, THOSE THINGS LIKE THE PLATYPUS OF
###2652 THE PLANT KINGDOM THAT I SHOWED YOU. THE WELWITSCHIA, OR THE
###2657 EPHEDRA THAT PRODUCES THAT STIMULANT EPHEDRIN. BUT NOW IT'S
###2660 CLEAR THAT THOSE ARE ACTUALLY MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO CONIFERS
###2663 THAN ANYTHING ELSE. THE GNETOPHYTES AND THE CONIFERS ARE
###2667 CLOSELY RELATED. AND WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT THE CLOSEST RELATIVES
###2670 OF THE ANGIOSPERMS ARE, BUT WE DO HAVE A BETTER IDEA ABOUT
###2674 RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE MAJOR GROUPS OF ANGIOSPERMS. AND FROM
###2679 HIGH SCHOOL BIOLOGY IF YOU HAD ANY MENTION OF FLOWERING PLANTS
###2684 THERE, YOU PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT DICOTS VERSUS MONOCOTS, THESE TWO
###2689 MAJOR GROUPS OF FLOWERING PLANTS. WELL, IT TURNS OUT THAT'S
###2692 SORT OF AN ARTIFICIAL DISTINCTION. ITS TRADITIONAL
###2696 DISTINCTION'S SIMPLISTIC. AND THE MONOCOTS ARE A GOOD
###2699 MONOPHYLETIC GROUP. AND WE'LL GET TO THEIR FEATURES IN A
###2703 MOMENT. BUT THAT INCLUDES ABOUT A QUARTER OF ALL FLOWERING
###2707 PLANTS. SO THAT'S A HUGE DIVERSITY OF FLOWERING PLANTS THERE.
###2711 IT INCLUDES THE GRASSES AND GRAINS. THE DICOTS THOUGH ARE ALL
###2717 THESE YELLOW LINEAGES, AND SO THEY'RE NOT A MONOPHYLETIC GROUP.
###2721 THEY'RE A PARAPHYLETIC GRADE. AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE PRESENCE OF
###2725 TWO COTYLEDONOUS OR EMBRYONIC LEAVES IS ANCESTRAL FOR FLOWERING
###2729 PLANTS. AND IT'S NOT A DERIVED FEATURE THAT DIAGNOSES A
###2732 MONOPHYLETIC GROUP. BUT THERE IS ONE GROUP CALLED THE EUDICOTS
###2738 THAT CONTAINS ABOUT TWO-THIRDS OF ALL ANGIOSPERM DIVERSITY,
###2743 TWO-THIRDS OF THE RECOGNIZED SPECIES. AND REMEMBER EU MEANS
###2746 TRUE, THESE ARE THE TRUE DICOTS AS THEY'RE SO-CALLED NOW EVEN
###2751 THOUGH THESE OTHER LINEAGES DO HAVE TWO COTYLEDONS. AND THEY'RE
###2754 A NICE MONOPHYLETIC GROUP. TOGETHER WITH THE MONOCOTS THEY MAKE
###2757 UP THE VAST MAJORITY OF ALL THE FLOWERING PLANTS. THESE OLDEST
###2762 LIVING LINEAGES HERE, WHICH YOU NO DOUBT, WELL, YOU MAY HAVE SEEN
###2766 WATER LILIES WHICH ARE AMONG SOME OF THE EARLY DIVERGING
###2769 LINEAGES, BUT THE OTHERS ARE OBSCURE, MOSTLY SOUTHERN TEMPERATE,
###2774 SOUTHERN TEMPERATE GROUPS IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE. THAT'S
###2777 ONLY ABOUT A HUNDRED SPECIES TOTAL THERE. AND THE MAGNOLIAS AND
###2781 RELATIVES, THAT'S ABOUT 8,000 SPECIES. BUT THE BULK OF THE
###2785 300,000 OR SO SPECIES ARE OVER HERE. AND WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON
###2789 THESE FOR THE REST OF THE COURSE. ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT?
###2796 THAT'S JUST SORT OF A GENERAL OVERVIEW. JUST WANT TO MAKE IT
###2799 
###2799 CLEAR THAT THE, WHY WE'RE CALLING THEM EUDICOTS RATHER THAN
###2803 DICOTS AS A WHOLE BECAUSE THIS IS THE NATURAL GROUP OF DICOTS
###2806 THAT MAKES UP MOST OF THEM. SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE FEATURES
###2811 SHARED BY MOST MONOCOTS AND SHARED BY MOST DICOTS. AND IN SOME
###2817 CASES THE FEATURE IS DERIVED IN THE MONOCOTS AND SOME CASES, OR
###2822 SOME CASES THE FEATURES THAT DISTINGUISH THEM, IN ONE, ONE OF
###2827 THEM'S DERIVED AND ONE OF THEM IS ANCESTRAL BASICALLY HERE IN
###2830 MOST OF THESE COMPARISONS. THOUGH MONOCOTS HAVE ONE
###2836 COTYLEDONOUS LEAF, AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT MORE WHEN WE TALK
###2839 ABOUT GERMINATION. AND THAT'S A GOOD FEATURE THAT WE FIND ACROSS
###2845 THE GROUP. ONE EMBRYONIC LEAF IS PRODUCED IN MONOCOTS WHEREAS
###2850 IN EUDICOTS LIKE IN OTHER DICOTS THERE ARE TWO COTYLEDONOUS
###2854 LEAVES THAT WE'LL LOOK AT HERE AGAIN IN MORE DETAIL IN A MINUTE.
###2859 AS FAR, THIS ISN'T VERY HELPFUL THOUGH BECAUSE THE COTYLEDONS ARE
###2862 LOST EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT. THEY'RE JUST EMBRYONIC LEAVES THAT
###2865 DON'T PERSIST VERY LONG. IN TERMS OF IDENTIFICATION IT'S NOT A
###2869 VERY HELPFUL FEATURE EVEN THOUGH IT'S CONSISTENT. LEAF
###2874 VENATION'S A GOOD FEATURE. MONOCOTS HAVE THIS DERIVED FEATURE OF
###2878 HAVING THEIR, THEIR VEINS, THE VASCULATURE OF THEIR LEAVES IN A
###2882 PARALLEL ORIENTATION OR SEMI-PARALLEL, AS YOU CAN SEE, FOR
###2887 EXAMPLE, IN A GRASS LEAF. WHEREAS THE VEINS OF A EUDICOT ARE
###2893 OFTEN NET-LIKE, SORT OF A RETICULUM OR WEB OF VENATION DIVERGING
###2900 IN DIFFERENT ANGLES WHICH IS NOT, IS ACTUALLY AN ANCESTRAL
###2904 FEATURE SHARED WITH EARLIER ANGIOSPERMS. IF YOU CUT OPEN THE
###2910 STEM, IF YOU DO A CROSS-SECTION OF THE STEM  -- AND WE'RE GOING TO
###2913 
###2913 GET INTO THIS A LOT MORE, SO I'M JUST GOING TO BRUSH OVER IT NOW
###2917 -THE VASCULAR OR CONDUCTING TISSUE IN A MONOCOT STEM, VASCULAR
###2922 TISSUE IN GENERAL IS IN LITTLE BUNDLES. THESE LITTLE BUNDLES
###2926 HERE INSIDE THE STEMS OF FLOWERING PLANTS DURING PRIMARY GROWTH.
###2932 WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT LATER. BUT IT'S SCATTERED AROUND
###2936 INSIDE THE STEMS OF MONOCOTS WHEREAS IN EUDICOTS, THE BUNDLES ARE
###2942 ARRANGED IN A RING LIKE THAT GENERALLY SPEAKING. AND WE'LL TALK
###2947 MORE ABOUT THAT LATER. BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN USE TO
###2950 DISTINGUISH MONOCOTS AND DICOTS, EUDICOTS. AND AS FAR AS ROOTS
###2956 GO, THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT. AND THIS IS IMPORTANT. IN
###2959 EUDICOTS, THE EMBRYONIC ROOT ACTUALLY CONTINUES TO DEVELOP AS A
###2966 TAPROOT, THE MAIN ROOT, AND THAN LATERAL ROOTS ARE PRODUCED FROM
###2970 THAT. WHEREAS IN MONOCOTS, THE TAPROOT DOESN'T PERSIST VERY
###2975 LONG. THE EMBRYONIC ROOT GROWS FOR AWHILE. AND THEN YOU START
###2979 GETTING ADVENTITIOUS ROOTS. AN ADVENTITIOUS ANYTHING IS JUST
###2983 SOMETHING THAT ORIGINATES FROM A POINT OTHER THAN ITS USUAL
###2986 ORIGIN. SO ADVENTITIOUS ROOTS FORM FROM THE BASE OF STEMS. SO
###2991 THE BASE OF THE STEM STARTS PRODUCING ROOTS. AND THE TAPROOT
###2995 DOESN'T CONTINUE TO DEVELOP. AND WE END UP WITH A FIBROUS ROOT
###2999 SYSTEM THAT'S OFTEN QUITE SHALLOW LIKE IN GRASSES, A TURF ROOT
###3005 SYSTEM, WHEREAS IN THE CASE OF EUDICOTS YOU OFTEN GET, OFTEN GET
###3009 A DEEP TAPROOT. OKAY, AND WE'LL HAVE TO COMPLETE THE REST OF
###3014 THIS NEXT TIME. AND WE'LL GET INTO GERMINATION AND DEVELOPMENT
###3018 RIGHT AWAY.
###3019
