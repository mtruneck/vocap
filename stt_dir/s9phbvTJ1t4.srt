0:0:2,401 --> 0:0:4,67
SO DEADLY


2
0:0:4,67 --> 0:0:7,973
IS NOT■■HEIR FANGS OR
THEIR VENOM, BUT THEIR WEBS--


3
0:0:7,973 --> 0:0:10,42
THOSE GRACEFUL STRANDS OF SILK.


4
0:0:10,42 --> 0:0:13,946
NOW, A COUSIN OF THESE SPIDERS
SPIN WEBS THAT ARE SO STRONG


5
0:0:13,946 --> 0:0:15,615
THEY'RE USED AS FISH NETS


6
0:0:15,615 --> 0:0:18,83
ON SOME ISLANDS IN
THE SOUTH PACIFIC.


7
0:0:18,83 --> 0:0:18,83
IN F
EVEN


8
0:0:18,83 --> 0:0:21,454
IGHT.


9
0:0:21,454 --> 0:0:23,922
THIS WEEK WE ENTER
THE DELICATE WORLD


10
0:0:23,922 --> 0:0:40,72
OF THE LOVELIEST DEATHTRAP--
THE WEB OF THE SPIDER.


11
0:0:40,72 --> 0:0:43,842
Narrator:
IT IS AN ANCIENT CREATURE


12
0:0:43,842 --> 0:0:47,58
AS OLD AS ANY
WALKING THE EARTH.


13
0:0:47,58 --> 0:0:54,72
THROUGH THE AGES, IT HAS
BECOME AN EXPERT WEAVER...


14
0:0:54,72 --> 0:0:56,489
A CONSUMMATE HUNTER


15
0:0:56,489 --> 0:1:0,493
AND, WITH MORE THAN
30,000 DIFFERENT FACES


16
0:1:0,493 --> 0:1:4,263
A MASTER OF ADAPTATION.


17
0:1:4,263 --> 0:1:9,968
IT LIVES ALL AROUND US--
IN OUR BACKYARDS AND GARDENS


18
0:1:9,968 --> 0:1:12,71
EVEN INSIDE OUR HOMES.


19
0:1:12,71 --> 0:1:15,708
YET MOST PEOPLE ARE TERRIFIED
BY THIS SOLITARY SPINNER


20
0:1:15,708 --> 0:1:31,857
AND ONLY A FEW KNOW THE INNER
WORKINGS OF THE SPIDER'S WORLD.


21
0:1:31,857 --> 0:1:34,26
LONG BEFORE THE DINOSAURS


22
0:1:34,26 --> 0:1:38,497
SPIDERS WERE ALREADY USING
SILK TO CATCH THEIR PREY.


23
0:1:38,497 --> 0:1:47,206
FROM THOSE FIRST RANDOM SNARES,
THE CLASSIC ORB WEB EVOLVED.


24
0:1:47,206 --> 0:1:50,61
THE SPIDER BEGINS
BY RELEASING A STRAND OF SILK


25
0:1:50,61 --> 0:1:50,61
THAT IS 


26
0:1:50,61 --> 0:2:4,523
RRENTS


27
0:2:4,523 --> 0:2:7,56
AN ORB CAN TAKE
AN HOUR OR MORE TO MAKE.


28
0:2:7,56 --> 0:2:12,898
HERE, THE PROCESS IS COMPRESSED
INTO A MINUTE.


29
0:2:12,898 --> 0:2:18,337
FIRST THE SPIDER LAYS DOWN A SET
OF LINES RADIATING FROM A HUB


30
0:2:18,337 --> 0:2:22,207
LIKE THE SPOKES OF A WHEEL.


31
0:2:22,207 --> 0:2:24,543
AFTER MAKING
A LOOSE SCAFFOLDING


32
0:2:24,543 --> 0:2:27,98
SHE MOVES INWARDS
AND CRAFTS A TIGHTER SPIRAL.


33
0:2:27,98 --> 0:2:29,948
THE SILK IS STICKIER NOW--


34
0:2:29,948 --> 0:2:59,77
THE KIND THAT WILL GLUE
HER VICTIMS TO THE WEB.


35
0:2:59,77 --> 0:3:3,349
ALL SPIDERS SPIN,
BUT WEBS CAN VARY GREATLY


36
0:3:3,349 --> 0:3:24,903
EACH BEARING THE SIGNATURE
OF ITS MAKER.


37
0:3:24,903 --> 0:3:26,772
ONE OF THE MOST UNMISTAKABLE


38
0:3:26,772 --> 0:3:29,542
IS THE HOME OF THE AUSTRALIAN
LEAF CURLER.


39
0:3:29,542 --> 0:3:32,878
SHE DESCENDS TO THE
FOREST FLOOR BY NIGHT


40
0:3:32,878 --> 0:3:39,151
TO GATHER BUILDING SUPPLIES.


41
0:3:39,151 --> 0:3:42,555
THE SPIDER ATTACHES A LEAF
TO THE SAME SILKEN CORD


42
0:3:42,555 --> 0:3:44,724
THAT BROUGHT HER TO THE GROUND.


43
0:3:44,724 --> 0:3:47,926
THEN, LIKE A HIGH-RISE
CONSTRUCTION WORKER


44
0:3:47,926 --> 0:4:1,173
SHE HAULS IT SEVERAL FEET
INTO THE AIR.


45
0:4:1,173 --> 0:4:5,177
THE LEAF WILL BECOME THE
CENTERPIECE OF HER NEW WEB


46
0:4:5,177 --> 0:4:15,2
BUT FIRST SHE MUST MAKE
SOME ALTERATIONS.


47
0:4:15,2 --> 0:4:18,56
THE LEAF IS COVERED WITH SILK


48
0:4:18,56 --> 0:4:25,3
WHICH WHEN DRY, WILL CURL
THE LEAF INTO PROPER SHAPE.


49
0:4:25,3 --> 0:4:26,732
THE JOB CAN TAKE HOURS


50
0:4:26,732 --> 0:4:41,781
BUT SPIDERS SEEM TO HAVE
INFINITE PATIENCE.


51
0:4:41,781 --> 0:4:46,485
WITH HER RETREAT FINISHED, THE
SPIDER CAN TURN HER ATTENTION


52
0:4:46,485 --> 0:4:49,955
TO A MORE PRESSING MATTER--
HER NEXT FEEDING.


53
0:4:49,955 --> 0:5:3,836
HER INSECT TRAP IS SET
OUTSIDE HER FRONT DOOR.


54
0:5:3,836 --> 0:5:6,705
WEB SPIDERS HAVE
EXTREMELY POOR SIGHT


55
0:5:6,705 --> 0:5:10,476
PERCEIVING MOST OF THEIR
WORLD BY TOUCH INSTEAD.


56
0:5:10,476 --> 0:5:15,113
IT WAS BY THAT SENSE ALONE THAT
THE LEAF CURLER FOUND HER LEAF


57
0:5:15,113 --> 0:5:16,816
AND CHANGED ITS SHAPE


58
0:5:16,816 --> 0:5:18,484
AND IT IS BY TOUCH NOW


59
0:5:18,484 --> 0:5:24,289
THAT SHE WEAVES THE INTRICATE
FABRIC OF HER LAIR.


60
0:5:24,289 --> 0:5:27,56
AND THERE IT IS,
THE PERFECT WEB--


61
0:5:27,56 --> 0:5:32,13
A WORK OF ART TO US,
A DEADLY SNARE FOR INSECTS


62
0:5:32,13 --> 0:5:40,539
AND FOR THE SPIDER,
THE ONLY MEANS OF SURVIVAL.


63
0:5:40,539 --> 0:5:42,74
SPIDERS ARE OPPORTUNISTIC.


64
0:5:42,74 --> 0:5:44,977
AND IF THEY CAN FIND A SHORTCUT,
THEY'LL TAKE IT.


65
0:5:44,977 --> 0:5:49,281
INSTEAD OF A LEAF AT THE HUB,
THIS LEAF CURLER HAS SUBSTITUTED


66
0:5:49,281 --> 0:5:55,921
A PREFAB STRUCTURE--
AN EMPTY SNAIL SHELL.


67
0:5:55,921 --> 0:5:59,424
MOST PEOPLE CAN RECOGNIZE
A SPIDER BY ITS EIGHT LEGS


68
0:5:59,424 --> 0:6:2,895
BUT THERE ARE OTHER
COMMON CHARACTERISTICS AS WELL.


69
0:6:2,895 --> 0:6:5,598
ALL USE SPINNERETS
FOR MAKING SILK.


70
0:6:5,598 --> 0:6:12,437
THE ONES ON THIS RELATIVE OF THE
TARANTULA ARE UNUSUALLY LONG.


71
0:6:12,437 --> 0:6:16,308
EVERY SPIDER'S BODY IS DIVIDED
INTO TWO SEGMENTS:


72
0:6:16,308 --> 0:6:18,577
A HEAD WITH UP TO EIGHT EYES


73
0:6:18,577 --> 0:6:22,915
AND AN ABDOMEN, WHERE ITS
VARIOUS SILK GLANDS LIE.<i> </i>


74
0:6:22,915 --> 0:6:26,284
DIFFERENT SILKS ARE USED
FOR DIFFERENT NEEDS.


75
0:6:26,284 --> 0:6:31,23
A FEMALE WEAVING AN EGG SAC WILL
LINE IT WITH HER SOFTEST SILK


76
0:6:31,23 --> 0:6:38,263
BUT COVER IT WITH HER TOUGHEST,
FOR PROTECTION.


77
0:6:38,263 --> 0:6:40,733
A SILK THREAD
CAN BE A SAFETY LINE


78
0:6:40,733 --> 0:6:44,3
WHEN A SPIDER DANGLES
HIGH ABOVE THE GROUND


79
0:6:44,3 --> 0:6:46,805
AND SILK IS USED
LIKE A TELEGRAPH--


80
0:6:46,805 --> 0:6:46,805
THE 
BETW


81
0:6:46,805 --> 0:6:54,146
NK


82
0:6:54,146 --> 0:6:57,215
AS NIGHT FALLS
ON AN AUSTRALIAN SUBURB


83
0:6:57,215 --> 0:7:0,619
A LARGE FEMALE SPIDER
COMES OUT OF HIDING.


84
0:7:0,619 --> 0:7:8,794
SHE HAS DEVELOPED A PARTICULARLY
INGENIOUS USE FOR SILK.


85
0:7:8,794 --> 0:7:11,83
UNLIKE A WEB DWELLER,
THE OGRE-FACED SPIDER


86
0:7:11,83 --> 0:7:15,133
DOESN'T WAIT FOR PREY
TO WANDER INTO HER HOME.


87
0:7:15,133 --> 0:7:25,678
SHE IS A NET CASTER,<i> </i>
AND HER WEB IS A MOBILE TRAP.


88
0:7:25,678 --> 0:7:27,913
AT NEARLY 200 STROKES A MINUTE


89
0:7:27,913 --> 0:7:30,515
SHE COMBS OUT
A SPECIAL KIND OF SILK


90
0:7:30,515 --> 0:7:47,8
WITH A ROW OF BRISTLES
ON HER LONG HIND LEGS.


91
0:7:47,8 --> 0:7:50,69
SHE ATTACHES
THE FINISHED THREADS


92
0:7:50,69 --> 0:7:54,94
AND STARTS COMBING
WITH THE OTHER LEG.


93
0:7:54,94 --> 0:7:54,94
WHAT STA
IS N


94
0:7:54,94 --> 0:8:3,348
F SILK
T.


95
0:8:3,348 --> 0:8:8,42
BUT HOW CAN A SCRAP OF FABRIC
NO BIGGER THAN A POSTAGE STAMP


96
0:8:8,42 --> 0:8:23,669
CATCH ENOUGH FOOD
FOR SUCH A LARGE SPIDER?


97
0:8:23,669 --> 0:8:30,308
SHE LIES IN AMBUSH
ABOVE AN INSECT HIGHWAY.


98
0:8:30,308 --> 0:8:34,346
UNLIKE THE LEAF CURLER,
HER NIGHT VISION IS EXCELLENT


99
0:8:34,346 --> 0:8:58,537
AND SHE'LL DETECT
THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT BELOW.


100
0:8:58,537 --> 0:9:1,707
THIS LARGE ANT IS
HOPELESSLY ENTANGLED


101
0:9:1,707 --> 0:9:4,943
BUT THE SPIDER, WARY
OF ITS FEROCIOUS STING


102
0:9:4,943 --> 0:9:18,9
RESTRAINS IT EVEN MORE.


103
0:9:18,9 --> 0:9:22,127
THE OGRE-FACED SPIDER CAN
MAKE SEVERAL CATCHES A NIGHT


104
0:9:22,127 --> 0:9:48,62
BUT FOR EACH ONE, SHE MUST
WEAVE A BRAND-NEW NET.


105
0:9:48,62 --> 0:9:53,225
NOT EVERY SPIDER USES AN
AIRBORNE ATTACK TO CATCH PREY.


106
0:9:53,225 --> 0:9:55,327
LIKE AN ENTRENCHED SOLDIER


107
0:9:55,327 --> 0:9:58,597
THE TRAP-DOOR SPIDER
PREFERS TERRA FIRMA.


108
0:9:58,597 --> 0:10:8,841
ITS SILK-LINED BURROW CAN
BE MORE THAN THREE FEET DEEP.


109
0:10:8,841 --> 0:10:13,145
RELYING ON ITS FEET
TO DETECT THE VIBRATIONS


110
0:10:13,145 --> 0:10:14,947
OF PASSING INSECTS


111
0:10:14,947 --> 0:10:24,389
IT CAN DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN
BUGS WITH AMAZING ACCURACY.


112
0:10:24,389 --> 0:10:28,36
LIKE VIRTUALLY ALL SPIDERS,
THE TRAP-DOOR IS CARNIVOROUS.


113
0:10:28,36 --> 0:10:31,529
IT CAN GO WITHOUT FOOD
FOR MONTHS IF NECESSARY


114
0:10:31,529 --> 0:10:46,578
BUT FOR THIS ONE,
THE LONG SIEGE IS OVER.


115
0:10:46,578 --> 0:10:49,681
TRAP-DOOR SPIDERS AND
THEIR CLOSE RELATIVES


116
0:10:49,681 --> 0:10:53,585
ARE DISTINGUISHED BY LARGE,
DOWNWARD-STRIKING FANGS.


117
0:10:53,585 --> 0:10:57,222
VENOM IS PRODUCED AS DROPLETS
AT THE TIP OF THE FANGS


118
0:10:57,222 --> 0:10:59,792
AND INJECTED WHEN
THE SPIDER STRIKES.


119
0:10:59,792 --> 0:11:1,96
MOST ARE DEADLY ONLY TO INSECTS


120
0:11:1,96 --> 0:11:4,529
BUT THE BITE OF THE
SYDNEY FUNNEL WEB


121
0:11:4,529 --> 0:11:13,305
CAN BE FATAL FOR PEOPLE AS WELL.


122
0:11:13,305 --> 0:11:43,135
FUNNEL WEBS HIDE IN BURROWS
UNDER ROCKS AND LOGS.


123
0:11:43,135 --> 0:11:47,873
THE VENOM OF THE MALE FUNNEL WEB
IS FIVE TIMES MORE TOXIC


124
0:11:47,873 --> 0:11:50,876
THAN THAT OF HIS
FEMALE COUNTERPART.


125
0:11:50,876 --> 0:11:52,644
DURING THE BREEDING SEASON


126
0:11:52,644 --> 0:11:55,881
HE STRAYS AWAY FROM HIS HOME
IN SEARCH OF A MATE


127
0:11:55,881 --> 0:12:5,357
BUT OCCASIONALLY MEETS
HIS HUMAN NEIGHBORS INSTEAD.


128
0:12:5,357 --> 0:12:8,626
AN UNSUSPECTING GARDENER
UNLEASHES A LETHAL THREAT


129
0:12:8,626 --> 0:12:37,289
WHEN HE DIGS UP ONE OF THESE
SPIDERS AND SETS HIM WANDERING.


130
0:12:37,289 --> 0:12:39,724
THIS MAY LOOK LIKE
A DANGEROUS GAME


131
0:12:39,724 --> 0:12:42,27
BUT THE CAT'S
NOT REALLY AT RISK.


132
0:12:42,27 --> 0:12:44,429
AMONG THE BACKBONED ANIMALS


133
0:12:44,429 --> 0:12:49,1
ONLY PRIMATES ARE BELIEVED TO BE
SUSCEPTIBLE TO FUNNEL WEB BITE


134
0:12:49,1 --> 0:13:5,45
WHICH IS BAD LUCK FOR PEOPLE.


135
0:13:5,45 --> 0:13:17,429
(<i> phone rings</i> )


136
0:13:17,429 --> 0:13:19,597
IF YOU KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THEM


137
0:13:19,597 --> 0:13:26,138
THERE IS ONE GOOD USE
FOR A FUNNEL WEB.


138
0:13:26,138 --> 0:13:28,907
USING THE SPIDER'S
OWN TOXIC VENOM


139
0:13:28,907 --> 0:13:42,454
SCIENTISTS HAVE FINALLY
DISCOVERED AN ANTIVENIN.


140
0:13:42,454 --> 0:13:45,958
OUS


141
0:13:45,958 --> 0:13:47,259
IS THE BLACK WIDOW.


142
0:13:47,259 --> 0:13:50,996
THIS IS HER COUSIN,
THE REDBACK.


143
0:13:50,996 --> 0:13:55,167
SHE BUILDS A PERMANENT TRAP
OUT OF STRONG, VERTICAL THREADS


144
0:13:55,167 --> 0:13:58,303
BEADED AT THE BASE
WITH A CONTACT ADHESIVE.


145
0:13:58,303 --> 0:14:6,144
IT'S AN INVISIBLE MAZE
WITH NO WAY OUT BUT DEATH.


146
0:14:6,144 --> 0:14:11,716
THE ANT CLEANS ITS ANTENNAE,
A SIGN THAT IT SENSES DANGER


147
0:14:11,716 --> 0:14:14,453
BUT ITS WARNING SYSTEM
IS TOO LATE.<i> </i>


148
0:14:14,453 --> 0:14:45,117
ABOVE WAITS AN ASSASSIN.


149
0:14:45,117 --> 0:14:47,319
WITH A SPECIAL COMB


150
0:14:47,319 --> 0:14:56,694
REDBACK SPIDERS AND THEIR
RELATIVES TIE UP THEIR VICTIMS.


151
0:14:56,694 --> 0:15:2,334
IN SLOW MOTION, THE SILK APPEARS
AS A RIBBON OF RAINBOW COLORS


152
0:15:2,334 --> 0:15:13,178
BUT TO THE ANT,
IT IS SIMPLY A SHROUD.


153
0:15:13,178 --> 0:15:15,78
<i> THIS SPIDER ISN'T
 STALKING AN INSECT.</i>

0:19:34,405 --> 0:19:38,509
SPECIES OF NEPHILA ARE AMONG
THE BIGGEST SPIDERS IN THE WORLD


185
0:19:38,509 --> 0:19:40,946
MEASURING UP TO
TEN INCHES ACROSS.


186
0:19:40,946 --> 0:19:45,416
THEY OFTEN BUILD THEIR ENORMOUS
WEBS IN TROPICAL GARDENS


187
0:19:45,416 --> 0:20:2,4
WHERE EXOTIC FLOWERS ATTRACT
HUGE MOTHS AND BUTTERFLIES.


188
0:20:2,4 --> 0:20:5,67
THIS MASSIVE SPIDER'S WEB
IS SO STRONG


189
0:20:5,67 --> 0:20:9,341
THAT IT HAS BEEN KNOWN
TO TRAP SMALL BIRDS


190
0:20:9,341 --> 0:20:26,491
BUT ITS INTENDED PREY
ARE LARGE INSECTS.


191
0:20:26,491 --> 0:20:26,491
SLOW


192
0:20:26,491 --> 0:20:28,493
 CAUGHT


193
0:20:28,493 --> 0:20:32,43
BUT EVEN THE WORLD'S FASTEST
FLYING INSECT, THE DRAGONFLY


194
0:20:32,43 --> 0:20:36,467
IS STOPPED COLD
BY THIS SUPER WEB.


195
0:20:36,467 --> 0:20:39,37
THESE SILKEN THREADS
MAY LOOK DELICATE


196
0:20:39,37 --> 0:21:1,259
BUT THEY HAVE
THE TENSILE STRENGTH OF STEEL.


197
0:21:1,259 --> 0:21:5,53
USUALLY ANYTHING MOVING ABOUT
IN A WEB IS FAIR GAME


198
0:21:5,53 --> 0:21:11,97
BUT THESE LITTLE SPIDERS FEED
FEARLESSLY ON NEPHILAS' CRUMBS.


199
0:21:11,97 --> 0:21:15,54
THEIR RELATIONSHIP
IS KNOWN AS COMMENSALISM


200
0:21:15,54 --> 0:21:20,778
WHICH LITERALLY MEANS
"FEEDING AT THE SAME TABLE."


201
0:21:20,778 --> 0:21:24,882
THE COMMENSALS CLEAN THE WEB
OF TINY UNWANTED INSECTS.


202
0:21:24,882 --> 0:21:34,92
IN RETURN, THEY GET PART
OF THEIR GIANT HOSTESS'S FEAST.


203
0:21:34,92 --> 0:21:36,194
BUT FOR REAL COMMUNITY SPIRIT


204
0:21:36,194 --> 0:21:38,696
NO SPIDER CAN MATCH
THE CRYTOPHORA.


205
0:21:38,696 --> 0:21:41,466
SPIDERS ARE GENERALLY
AN ANTISOCIAL LOT


206
0:21:41,466 --> 0:21:45,203
BUT THIS SOUTH SEAS NATIVE
SHARES ITS GARGANTUAN WEB


207
0:21:45,203 --> 0:21:50,308
WITH HUNDREDS OF ITS KIND.


208
0:21:50,308 --> 0:21:51,876
WITHIN THE WEB


209
0:21:51,876 --> 0:21:55,313
EACH CRYTOPHORA DEFENDS
ITS OWN TERRITORY AND ORB


210
0:21:55,313 --> 0:21:58,16
BUT THEIR HOMES
ARE ALL LINKED TOGETHER


211
0:21:58,16 --> 0:22:32,5
TO FORM WHAT LOOKS LIKE
A FLOATING CITY.


212
0:22:32,5 --> 0:22:33,651
MANY FOREST SPIDERS USE


213
0:22:33,651 --> 0:22:36,654
NEITHER WEBS NOR NETS
TO CAPTURE THEIR PREY


214
0:22:36,654 --> 0:22:38,856
BUT DEPEND RATHER ON SPEED.


215
0:22:38,856 --> 0:22:58,543
THIS TREE TRUNK IS A PROMISING
SITE FOR THE SMALL TAMA SPIDER.


216
0:22:58,543 --> 0:23:2,613
SHE WRESTLES AN ANT BETWEEN
HER TWO TAIL-LIKE SPINNERETS


217
0:23:2,613 --> 0:23:8,386
AND THEN TIES IT UP WITH SILK.


218
0:23:8,386 --> 0:23:10,388
SHE MOVES IN FOR THE KILL


219
0:23:10,388 --> 0:23:15,626
BITING HER VICTIM
BEFORE EATING IT.


220
0:23:15,626 --> 0:23:18,396
TAMA IS NOT ALWAYS SO FRENETIC.


221
0:23:18,396 --> 0:23:20,165
WHEN SHE'S NOT HUNTING


222
0:23:20,165 --> 0:23:38,649
SHE SITS SO STILL
SHE IS NEARLY IMPERCEPTIBLE.


223
0:23:38,649 --> 0:23:42,954
JUMPING SPIDERS ARE THE AERIAL
ACROBATS OF THE SPIDER WORLD.


224
0:23:42,954 --> 0:23:45,79
LAUNCHING THEMSELVES
AT HIGH SPEED


225
0:23:45,79 --> 0:23:48,226
THEY LEAP ACROSS OPEN SPACES


226
0:23:48,226 --> 0:24:1,539
BUT IF ONE MISSES ITS MARK,
A SAFETY LINE IS ALWAYS AT HAND.


227
0:24:1,539 --> 0:24:4,509
OF THEIR EIGHT EYES,<i> </i>
TWO ARE DRAMATICALLY ENLARGED


228
0:24:4,509 --> 0:24:7,678
GIVING THEM GOOD VISION
FOR DAYTIME HUNTING


229
0:24:7,678 --> 0:24:12,45
AS WELL AS
A FRIENDLY APPEARANCE.


230
0:24:12,45 --> 0:24:15,386
JUMPING SPIDERS ARE FOUND
ALL OVER THE WORLD.


231
0:24:15,386 --> 0:24:20,291
MOST ARE LESS THAN HALF AN INCH
LONG AND ARE STRIKINGLY COLORED


232
0:24:20,291 --> 0:24:27,532
BUT BECAUSE FEW MAKE WEBS,
THEY'RE OFTEN OVERLOOKED.


233
0:24:27,532 --> 0:24:31,136
LEAVES OF PLANTS
ARE THEIR HUNTING GROUNDS.


234
0:24:31,136 --> 0:24:53,458
A SUNBATHING FLY
CAN BE A REAL CHALLENGE.


235
0:24:53,458 --> 0:24:56,961
THE FLY PROVES TOO QUICK
EVEN FOR A JUMPING SPIDER


236
0:24:56,961 --> 0:24:59,531
BUT NO MATTER,
JUMPERS AREN'T PICKY EATERS.


237
0:24:59,531 --> 0:25:29,594
THEY'LL EVEN PREY
ON OTHER SPIDERS.


238
0:25:29,594 --> 0:25:33,3
SPIDERS HAVE EXPLOITED
EVERY CORNER OF THE GLOBE


239
0:25:33,3 --> 0:25:34,732
EXCEPT THE DEEP OCEANS.


240
0:25:34,732 --> 0:25:39,337
FRESH WATER SUITS THE DOLOMEDES
SPIDER JUST FINE, HOWEVER.


241
0:25:39,337 --> 0:25:45,91
ITS DIET EVEN INCLUDES FISH.


242
0:25:45,91 --> 0:25:48,846
THIS IS AN ANGLER
THAT USES NO BAIT


243
0:25:48,846 --> 0:25:53,284
AND SURPRISINGLY,
NO SILKEN FISHING LINE.


244
0:25:53,284 --> 0:25:56,153
THE HAIRS ON THE SPIDER'S LEGS
ACT AS FLOATS.


245
0:25:56,153 --> 0:26:3,728
THEY PREVENT HIM FROM SINKING
THROUGH THE SURFACE FILM.


246
0:26:3,728 --> 0:26:7,298
PATIENCE IS THE HALLMARK
OF ANY GOOD FISHERMAN.


247
0:26:7,298 --> 0:26:15,273
WHILE FISH SWIM BELOW,
THE SPIDER WAITS FOR HIS MOMENT.


248
0:26:15,273 --> 0:26:18,443
WHEN HE DIVES,
THE AIR BUBBLES ON HIS LEG HAIRS


249
0:26:18,443 --> 0:26:20,945
WILL DRAW HIM BACK UP
TO THE SURFACE


250
0:26:20,945 --> 0:26:27,285
SO HE DRIES HIS LEGS CAREFULLY
BETWEEN PLUNGES.


251
0:26:27,285 --> 0:26:30,455
THE FISH SEE ONLY
A DISTORTED SHAPE ABOVE THEM


252
0:26:30,455 --> 0:26:44,835
AND SHOW NO FEAR,
AND THAT'S THEIR UNDOING.


253
0:26:44,835 --> 0:26:47,171
SPIDERS CAN'T EAT SOLID FOOD.


254
0:26:47,171 --> 0:26:50,608
THEY MUST CRUSH THEIR PREY
AND PREDIGEST IT


255
0:26:50,608 --> 0:26:52,91
THEN SUCK IT UP AS A LIQUID.


256
0:26:52,91 --> 0:27:0,84
THIS ONE'S TURNING THE CATCH
OF THE DAY INTO FISH SOUP.


257
0:27:0,84 --> 0:27:3,154
<i> DON'T LOOK NOW-- THAT INNOCENT
 BUMP ON A BRANCH</i>


258
0:27:3,154 --> 0:27:5,556

NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC EXPLORER.


313
0:30:46,577 --> 0:30:49,614
Narrator:
WHEREVER THERE ARE FLOWERS,
INSECTS CAN BE FOUND


314
0:30:49,614 --> 0:31:2,26
AND SPIDERS ARE BOUND TO FOLLOW.


315
0:31:2,26 --> 0:31:5,63
THESE SPIDERS DON'T USE WEBS
TO TRAP THEIR PREY.


316
0:31:5,63 --> 0:31:30,855
THEY RELY INSTEAD ON CAMOUFLAGE
AND THE FLOWER'S LURE.


317
0:31:30,855 --> 0:31:33,57
SITTING ABSOLUTELY STILL


318
0:31:33,57 --> 0:31:37,461
A FLOWER SPIDER MAY HAVE TO WAIT
DAYS FOR SUITABLE QUARRY.


319
0:31:37,461 --> 0:31:40,33
EVEN THEN,
IT WON'T MAKE ITS MOVE


320
0:31:40,33 --> 0:32:13,33
UNTIL ITS VICTIM IS AT
THE PRECISE STRIKING DISTANCE.


321
0:32:13,33 --> 0:32:16,166
EVEN AN INSECT MUCH LARGER
THAN THE SPIDER


322
0:32:16,166 --> 0:32:41,726
IS NOT SAFE FROM AMBUSH.


323
0:32:41,726 --> 0:32:44,95
THE SPIDER'S DISGUISE IS SO GOOD


324
0:32:44,95 --> 0:32:55,74
THAT IT EVEN FOOLS THIS
BUTTERFLY INTO LANDING ON IT.


325
0:32:55,74 --> 0:32:59,744
CKGROUND


326
0:32:59,744 --> 0:33:2,13
TO DECEIVE A KEEN-EYED PREDATOR


327
0:33:2,13 --> 0:33:5,82
A SPIDER PRETENDS
IT IS SOMETHING INEDIBLE.


328
0:33:5,82 --> 0:33:21,198
THE TRICK IS NOT TO MOVE.


329
0:33:21,198 --> 0:33:26,37
ANY LUMP OR BUMP ON A TREE
MAY TURN OUT TO BE A SPIDER.


330
0:33:26,37 --> 0:33:35,179
THIS ONE APPEARS TO BE A BIRD
DROPPING-- UNTIL IT WALKS AWAY.


331
0:33:35,179 --> 0:33:55,232
WE OURSELVES ARE OFTEN UNAWARE
OF THE SPIDERS AROUND US.


332
0:33:55,232 --> 0:33:58,635
THE FLAT SHAPE AND CAMOUFLAGE
PATTERN OF PANDERCETES


333
0:33:58,635 --> 0:34:0,237
HELP CONCEAL IT.


334
0:34:0,237 --> 0:34:5,42
HAIRS ON ITS LEGS BLUR THE
SHADOW THAT MIGHT GIVE IT AWAY.


335
0:34:5,42 --> 0:34:9,546
IN THIS CASE, THE DISGUISE
IS NOT JUST FOR DEFENSE


336
0:34:9,546 --> 0:34:30,234
AS A TINY BARK MANTIS
IS ABOUT TO DISCOVER.


337
0:34:30,234 --> 0:34:33,337
PLAYING WALLFLOWER
MAY BE FINE FOR SOME


338
0:34:33,337 --> 0:34:38,609
BUT OTHER SPIDERS HAVE TAKEN THE
ART OF DECEPTION A STEP FURTHER.


339
0:34:38,609 --> 0:34:45,582
YOU CAN TELL THIS IS AN ANT BY
HER TWO ANTENNAE AND SIX LEGS.


340
0:34:45,582 --> 0:34:48,52
BUT THIS ONE IS AN IMPOSTOR.


341
0:34:48,52 --> 0:34:51,355
THE SPIDER WAVES
TWO OF ITS EIGHT LEGS ABOUT


342
0:34:51,355 --> 0:35:1,198
IMITATING THE ANT'S ANTENNAE.


343
0:35:1,198 --> 0:35:5,569
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT KINDS
OF THESE ANT-MIMICKING SPIDERS.


344
0:35:5,569 --> 0:35:23,22
EACH ONE SPECIFICALLY COPIES
THE ANT IT PREYS ON.


345
0:35:23,22 --> 0:35:24,554
THIS ONE IS A DOUBLE


346
0:35:24,554 --> 0:35:29,559
FOR THE FIERCE WEAVER ANTS
OF TROPICAL AUSTRALIA.


347
0:35:29,559 --> 0:35:31,996
LIVING LIKE A SPY
IN ENEMY TERRITORY


348
0:35:31,996 --> 0:35:35,32
IT FEEDS ON THEM EXCLUSIVELY.


349
0:35:35,32 --> 0:35:36,6
WHILE EATING AN ANT


350
0:35:36,6 --> 0:35:49,146
THE SPIDER RETREATS SAFELY
TO ITS SILK THREAD.


351
0:35:49,146 --> 0:35:52,349
BUT THE NUMBERS ARE STACKED
AGAINST THE SPIDER


352
0:35:52,349 --> 0:36:3,493
AND SOMETIMES THE HUNTER
BECOMES THE HUNTED.


353
0:36:3,493 --> 0:36:5,863
WARY OF THE ANTS
PATROLLING ABOVE


354
0:36:5,863 --> 0:36:13,403
THE SPIDER DROPS DOWN
HIS ESCAPE ROPE.


355
0:36:13,403 --> 0:36:15,239
IT RARELY HAPPENS


356
0:36:15,239 --> 0:36:39,964
BUT THIS TIME THE TABLES
ARE TURNED ON THE SPIDER.


357
0:36:39,964 --> 0:36:41,665
ANOTHER AUSTRALIAN SPIDER


358
0:36:41,665 --> 0:36:47,371
ACTUALLY SEEMS TO SPEAK
THE LANGUAGE OF HER PREY.


359
0:36:47,371 --> 0:36:51,508
SHE FEEDS ON MEAT ANTS, WHICH
LIVE IN LARGE MOUNDED NESTS


360
0:36:51,508 --> 0:36:59,816
AT THE CENTER
OF WELL-WORN FORAGING TRACKS.


361
0:36:59,816 --> 0:37:1,986
FROM HER UNIQUELY SHAPED WEB


362
0:37:1,986 --> 0:37:5,155
THIS INDUSTRIOUS CREATURE
EARNED HER NAME:


363
0:37:5,155 --> 0:37:10,46
THE LOBSTER POT SPIDER.


364
0:37:10,46 --> 0:37:16,166
WHEN AN ANT COMES TO INVESTIGATE
HER LAIR, THE SPIDER EMERGES.


365
0:37:16,166 --> 0:37:21,571
SHE APPEARS TO TAP OUT A MESSAGE
IN ANT FASHION


366
0:37:21,571 --> 0:37:40,391
BUT FOR NOW,
HER GREETING GOES UNANSWERED.


367
0:37:40,391 --> 0:37:43,928
AGAIN THE SPIDER TAPS OUT
HER TACTILE INVITATION


368
0:37:43,928 --> 0:37:43,928
AND 


369
0:37:43,928 --> 0:38:3,747
ANT


370
0:38:3,747 --> 0:38:19,196
THE UNSUSPECTING GUEST
IS SEIZED AND EATEN.


371
0:38:19,196 --> 0:38:21,798
THE BOLAS SPIDER
IS EVEN MORE DEVIOUS


372
0:38:21,798 --> 0:38:35,79
ATTRACTING HER VICTIMS
WITH AN IRRESISTIBLE BAIT.


373
0:38:35,79 --> 0:38:38,182
THE CLASSIC ORB WEB
OF HER ANCESTORS


374
0:38:38,182 --> 0:38:48,292
HAS EVOLVED INTO A SINGLE THREAD
IN HER SPECIES.


375
0:38:48,292 --> 0:38:56,566
SHE DANGLES IT LIKE A FISHING
LINE BEADED WITH STICKY DROPS.


376
0:38:56,566 --> 0:39:0,4
IT SEEMS LIKE A POOR WAY
TO CATCH A FLYING INSECT


377
0:39:0,4 --> 0:39:6,977
AND THE BOLAS FEEDS ONLY ON
MALE MOTHS OF A PARTICULAR KIND.


378
0:39:6,977 --> 0:39:10,28
INCREDIBLY, THE SPIDER
LURES HER PREY


379
0:39:10,28 --> 0:39:10,28
WITH
BY FEMAL


380
0:39:10,28 --> 0:39:20,491
 MATING.


381
0:39:20,491 --> 0:39:59,229
WHEN THE MALE MOTH HOMES IN
ON THIS SINGULAR PERFUME


382
0:39:59,229 --> 0:40:3,434
THE MOTH ENDS UP IN THE ARMS
OF A VERY DIFFERENT FEMALE


383
0:40:3,434 --> 0:40:11,275
THAN HE SET OUT TO MEET.


384
0:40:11,275 --> 0:40:14,678
THOUGH FEMALES DOMINATE
THE LORE OF SPIDERS


385
0:40:14,678 --> 0:40:20,35
MALES DO HAVE ONE
VERY IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY.


386
0:40:20,35 --> 0:40:23,82
ON A SPECIAL WEB,
THIS LARGE-JAWED SPIDER


387
0:40:23,82 --> 0:40:34,198
IS DEPOSITING A DROPLET
OF WHITE SPERM FLUID.


388
0:40:34,198 --> 0:40:37,468
IT FLOWS FROM THE SPIDER'S
GENITAL OPENING


389
0:40:37,468 --> 0:40:42,106
HALFWAY ALONG HIS BODY.


390
0:40:42,106 --> 0:40:45,8
NOW HE PICKS THE DROPLET
OFF THE SPERM WEB


391
0:40:45,8 --> 0:40:48,979
AND DRAWS THE FLUID INTO
THE MATING ORGANS ON HIS FEELERS


392
0:40:48,979 --> 0:41:3,93
KNOWN AS PALPS.


393
0:41:3,93 --> 0:41:5,362
HIS PREPARATIONS COMPLETE


394
0:41:5,362 --> 0:41:17,374
THE MALE IS NOW READY


395
0:41:17,374 --> 0:41:21,178
DOWN IN THE GRASS, A LINK SPIDER
TRIES TO CHARM A FEMALE.


396
0:41:21,178 --> 0:41:23,747
LIKE ALL SPIDERS
THAT HUNT BY DAY


397
0:41:23,747 --> 0:41:31,355
THEIR MATING HABITS
ARE VERY VISUAL.


398
0:41:31,355 --> 0:41:33,29
THE FEMALE WATCHES INTENTLY.


399
0:41:33,29 --> 0:41:36,56
SHE WON'T RESPOND
UNTIL HE'S ESTABLISHED HIMSELF


400
0:41:36,56 --> 0:41:51,941
AS ONE OF HER OWN KIND.


401
0:41:51,941 --> 0:41:57,8
WAVING HIS CONSPICUOUS BLACK
PALPS, HE SIGNALS HIS INTENT.


402
0:41:57,8 --> 0:41:59,983
HE TAPS THE FEMALE
WITH HIS HAIRY FRONT LEGS


403
0:41:59,983 --> 0:42:19,35
AND SHE SEEMS INTRIGUED.


404
0:42:19,35 --> 0:42:30,13
BUT APPARENTLY
SHE WAS ONLY LEADING HIM ON.


405
0:42:30,13 --> 0:42:32,949
THE MOST ELEGANT RITUALS
OF SPIDER COURTSHIP


406
0:42:32,949 --> 0:42:44,194
ARE FOUND AMONG
THE JUMPING SPIDERS.


407
0:42:44,194 --> 0:42:47,531
THE MATE OF THIS LITTLE FEMALE
FROM THE TROPICS


408
0:42:47,531 --> 0:42:49,199
NED


409
0:42:49,199 --> 0:42:52,102
BY HIS BLACK FACE
AND WHITE SIDE WHISKERS


410
0:42:52,102 --> 0:42:54,605
MUST


411
0:42:54,605 --> 0:42:56,74
NOT WITH HIS PALPS THIS TIME


412
0:42:56,74 --> 0:43:6,583
BUT WITH HIS DISTINCTIVE
BLACK LEGS.


413
0:43:6,583 --> 0:43:9,519
HE MUST FIRST CAPTURE
HER FULL ATTENTION.


414
0:43:9,519 --> 0:43:12,556
PERHAPS BECAUSE
SHE'S MORE INTERESTED


415
0:43:12,556 --> 0:43:15,24
IN CATCHING FLIES THAN A MATE


416
0:43:15,24 --> 0:43:22,832
THIS IS HARD TO DO, BUT HE'S
PERSISTENT AND FOLLOWS HER.


417
0:43:22,832 --> 0:43:36,313
HE MAKES PRECISE, RITUALIZED
MOVEMENTS WITH HIS FRONT LEGS...


418
0:43:36,313 --> 0:43:51,6
BUT SHE STILL SEEMS ALOOF.


419
0:43:51,6 --> 0:43:55,64
EVENTUALLY, THE FEMALE LETS HIM
ADVANCE AND STROKE HER HEAD.


420
0:43:55,64 --> 0:43:58,868
THE MASSAGE PUTS HER
INTO A TRANCELIKE STATE


421
0:43:58,868 --> 0:44:2,38
AND THE MALE IS AT LAST ABLE
TO TILT HER ABDOMEN


422
0:44:2,38 --> 0:44:9,646
AND PROCEED WITH MATING.


423
0:44:9,646 --> 0:44:12,416
WHILE THE EXACT RITUALS
OF COURTSHIP


424
0:44:12,416 --> 0:44:14,484
ARE UNIQUE TO EACH SPECIES


425
0:44:14,484 --> 0:44:18,888
ALL SPIDERS ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE
TO TOUCH AND VIBRATIONS


426
0:44:18,888 --> 0:44:25,729
SO COMMUNICATION BETWEEN MALES
AND FEMALES IS USUALLY TACTILE.


427
0:44:25,729 --> 0:44:32,969
THIS MALE NET-CASTING SPIDER IS
ON THE LINE TO A POTENTIAL MATE.


428
0:44:32,969 --> 0:44:35,38
HE PRESENTS HIS CREDENTIALS


429
0:44:35,38 --> 0:44:37,941
IN THE SPECIAL LANGUAGE
OF HIS KIND...


430
0:44:37,941 --> 0:44:40,444
AND WINS HER OVER.


431
0:44:40,444 --> 0:44:44,113
THIS TANGLE OF 16 LEGS
LOOKS A BIT AWKWARD


432
0:44:44,113 --> 0:44:53,289
BUT THE SPIDERS KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING.


433
0:44:53,289 --> 0:44:55,925
WITH HIS PALP SWELLING
LIKE A BALLOON


434
0:44:55,925 --> 0:45:18,415
THE MALE FERTILIZES HIS MATE.


435
0:45:18,415 --> 0:45:21,785
THE COILED DUCT, OR EMBOLUS
THAT DELIVERS THE SPERM


436
0:45:21,785 --> 0:45:23,987
IS RETRACTED BACK INTO THE PALP.


437
0:45:23,987 --> 0:45:33,363
SOON THE WHOLE PROCESS WILL BE
REPEATED WITH THE OTHER PALP.


438
0:45:33,363 --> 0:45:48,11
BY STORING ENOUGH SPERM
FOR SEVERAL BATCHES OF EGGS


439
0:45:48,11 --> 0:45:50,179
BUT MALES CAN MATE
SEVERAL TIMES.


440
0:45:50,179 --> 0:45:52,449
THIS ONE'S CLEANING HIS PALPS


441
0:45:52,449 --> 0:45:58,422
SO HE'LL BE READY
FOR HIS NEXT ALLIANCE.


442
0:45:58,422 --> 0:46:0,624
<i> WHEN SOME MALE
 SPIDERS GO COURTING</i>


443
0:46:0,624 --> 0:46:2,292
<i> THEY'RE ALSO COURTING DEATH.</i>


444
0:46:2,292 --> 0:47:8,658
<i> IT'S "DANGEROUS LIAISONS" NEXT.</i>


445
0:47:8,658 --> 0:47:10,36

446
0:47:10,36 --> 0:47:30,547

 GEOGRAPHIC EXPLORER<i> ON TBS.</i>

0:47:30,547 --> 0:47:30,547

448
0:47:30,547 --> 0:47:32,983
<i>THANKS TO SMARTRATE
FROM THE DISCOVER CARD,</i>


449
0:47:32,983 --> 0:47:37,721

450
0:47:37,721 --> 0:48:45,555

<i>■■■■■■■■■</i>


452
0:48:47,9 --> 0:48:52,128
<i>  AND NOW BACK TO</i>
 NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC EXPLORER.


453
0:48:52,128 --> 0:48:56,933
Narrator:
MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT FEMALE
SPIDERS ALWAYS EAT THEIR MATES.


454
0:48:56,933 --> 0:49:0,87
WHEN THE SEXES ARE ABOUT THE
SAME SIZE, THIS SELDOM OCCURS


455
0:49:0,87 --> 0:49:3,64
BUT THE FEMALE
SAINT ANDREWS CROSS SPIDER


456
0:49:3,64 --> 0:49:10,847
IS A GIANT
COMPARED WITH HER MATE.


457
0:49:10,847 --> 0:49:16,686
AND THE MALE THAT COURTS HER
COURTS DEATH.


458
0:49:16,686 --> 0:49:19,856
WHEN A POTENTIAL SUITOR
APPROACHES A FEMALE


459
0:49:19,856 --> 0:49:26,796
HE MUST QUICKLY IDENTIFY HIMSELF
AS A MALE RATHER THAN A MEAL.


460
0:49:26,796 --> 0:49:33,269
HE SITS VERY STILL
ON THE OPPOSITE FACE OF HER WEB.


461
0:49:33,269 --> 0:49:35,571
HE'S MADE A HOLE IN IT


462
0:49:35,571 --> 0:49:45,115
SO HE CAN MAKE A DASH FOR SAFETY
IF SHE ATTACKS.


463
0:49:45,115 --> 0:50:8,538
RISKING LIFE AND LIMB,
HE PERFORMS A MATING DANCE.


464
0:50:8,538 --> 0:50:11,708
ONTO


465
0:50:11,708 --> 0:50:13,643
THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE WEB.


466
0:50:13,643 --> 0:50:17,446
HE PLUCKS A TACTILE SERENADE
ON A SILK THREAD


467
0:50:17,446 --> 0:50:17,446
AND SHE 


468
0:50:17,446 --> 0:50:23,119
 FEET.


469
0:50:23,119 --> 0:50:31,26
HIS LOVE SONG HAS WORKED
AND THEY BEGIN TO MATE.


470
0:50:31,26 --> 0:50:35,131
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING SINISTER
GOING ON BEHIND HIS BACK.


471
0:50:35,131 --> 0:50:42,906
WHY IS SHE PULLING OUT
A SILK NOOSE?


472
0:50:42,906 --> 0:50:50,146
SENSING TREACHERY,
HE LEAPS AWAY.


473
0:50:50,146 --> 0:50:53,149
THE MALE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN
KNOCKED OFF BALANCE


474
0:50:53,149 --> 0:50:54,884
BY THIS DANGEROUS LIAISON.


475
0:50:54,884 --> 0:50:59,55
IN FACT, HE'S ONLY GOT
SEVEN LEGS LEFT.


476
0:50:59,55 --> 0:51:3,326
THE FEMALE'S EATING
THE EIGHTH ONE.


477
0:51:3,326 --> 0:51:8,64
STILL, THE DRIVE TO REPRODUCE
IS OVERWHELMING.


478
0:51:8,64 --> 0:51:10,2
THE MALE MAKES ANOTHER ATTEMPT.


479
0:51:10,2 --> 0:51:12,401
IF HE'S LUCKY, HE'LL SUCCEED.


480
0:51:12,401 --> 0:51:21,41
IF HE'S EVEN LUCKIER,


481
0:51:21,41 --> 0:51:26,282
ONE THING IS CERTAIN: A MALE
SAINT ANDREWS CROSS SPIDER


482
0:51:26,282 --> 0:51:34,19
IS UNLIKELY TO DIE OF OLD AGE.


483
0:51:34,19 --> 0:51:36,25
THOUGH SOME FEMALES DISPLAY


484
0:51:36,25 --> 0:51:38,461
OUTRIGHT HOSTILITY
TOWARD THEIR MATES


485
0:51:38,461 --> 0:51:42,165
THEY ARE DEVOTED
TO THEIR OFFSPRING.


486
0:51:42,165 --> 0:51:44,433
ALL SPIDERS ENCLOSE THEIR EGGS


487
0:51:44,433 --> 0:51:47,603
IN AN EGG SAC LINED
WITH THE SOFTEST SILK.


488
0:51:47,603 --> 0:51:49,939
BUT THE NURSERY
OF THE WOLF SPIDER


489
0:51:49,939 --> 0:51:52,242
MUST ALSO HAVE A TOUGH EXTERIOR.


490
0:51:52,242 --> 0:51:58,314
LIKE HER NAMESAKE, THIS SPIDER
IS ALWAYS ON THE MOVE.


491
0:51:58,314 --> 0:52:1,17
SHE MUST DRAG IT ALONG
WHEREVER SHE GOES


492
0:52:1,17 --> 0:52:3,552
LIKE A BABY CARRIAGE IN REVERSE.


493
0:52:3,552 --> 0:52:5,155
VERY FEW SPIDERS RISK


494
0:52:5,155 --> 0:52:8,158
PUTTING ALL THEIR EGGS
IN ONE BASKET, HOWEVER.


495
0:52:8,158 --> 0:52:16,199
A BOLAS SPIDER MAY CREATE
MANY EGG SACS EACH YEAR.


496
0:52:16,199 --> 0:52:18,168
POURING LIKE WATER FROM A TAP


497
0:52:18,168 --> 0:52:21,47
THESE EGGS ARE JUST A FEW
OF THE SEVERAL THOUSAND


498
0:52:21,47 --> 0:52:31,547
THAT THE MOTHER WILL LAY
IN A SINGLE SEASON.


499
0:52:31,547 --> 0:52:36,119
EGG SACS ARE AS DISTINCT AS
THE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF SPIDER.


500
0:52:36,119 --> 0:52:51,67
THE NET-CASTER ROTATES HERS
AS SHE WEAVES.


501
0:52:51,67 --> 0:52:53,402
SHE SEES NOTHING
OF WHAT SHE'S DOING.


502
0:52:53,402 --> 0:52:55,138
THROUGH TOUCH ALONE


503
0:52:55,138 --> 0:53:2,312
SHE CRAFTS A PERFECTLY OVAL
CRADLE FOR HER BABIES.


504
0:53:2,312 --> 0:53:14,69
PROGRESSIVE LAYERS ARE MADE
FROM DIFFERENT SILKS.


505
0:53:14,69 --> 0:53:18,461
LIKE A JEWEL BOX,
A SPIDER'S EGG SAC IS OPENED


506
0:53:18,461 --> 0:53:25,34
TO REVEAL EMERALD GREEN
SPIDERLINGS.


507
0:53:25,34 --> 0:53:28,304
THE NEWBORNS STAY CLOSE
TO THEIR ABANDONED NURSERY


508
0:53:28,304 --> 0:53:30,6
UNTIL THEY'VE MOLTED.


509
0:53:30,6 --> 0:53:39,48
THERE'S SAFETY IN NUMBERS.


510
0:53:39,48 --> 0:53:41,817
AFTER SEVERAL WEEKS
OF BEING PROTECTED


511
0:53:41,817 --> 0:53:46,22
FROM THE ELEMENTS AND PREDATORS,
THESE YOUNGSTERS HAVE EMERGED


512
0:53:46,22 --> 0:53:58,34
INTO A WORLD
FRAUGHT WITH HAZARD.


513
0:53:58,34 --> 0:54:2,205
THE FEMALE HUNTSMAN SPIDER
HAS A STRONG MATERNAL INSTINCT.


514
0:54:2,205 --> 0:54:5,574
SHE GUARDS HER YOUNG
AND PROVIDES THEM WITH FOOD


515
0:54:5,574 --> 0:54:7,877
AS THEY GATHER AROUND HER MOUTH.


516
0:54:7,877 --> 0:54:34,938
ANY DISTURBANCE SETS OFF
A CHAIN REACTION IN THE CLUSTER.


517
0:54:34,938 --> 0:54:38,975
THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO BREAK
OUT OF THE SAC BY THEMSELVES.


518
0:54:38,975 --> 0:54:41,11
THEIR MOTHER OPENS IT FOR THEM.


519
0:54:41,11 --> 0:54:44,314
SHE KEEPS THE HATCHLINGS
CLOSE BY AT ALL TIMES.


520
0:54:44,314 --> 0:54:47,5
CLINGING TO SPECIAL HAIRS
ON HER ABDOMEN


521
0:54:47,5 --> 0:54:58,794
THEY RIDE PIGGYBACK EVERYWHERE.


522
0:54:58,794 --> 0:55:2,131
AS SEASON FOLLOWS SEASON
ALL AROUND THE WORLD


523
0:55:2,131 --> 0:55:30,493
NEW GENERATIONS OF SPIDERS
EXPLODE INTO LIFE AND DISPERSE.


524
0:55:30,493 --> 0:55:35,31
MOST WILL LIVE ONLY BRIEFLY,
PREYED ON BY BIRDS, INSECTS


525
0:55:35,31 --> 0:55:36,866
AND EVEN THEIR OWN KIND


526
0:55:36,866 --> 0:55:40,47
BUT THOSE THAT DO SURVIVE
WILL NEED NO APPRENTICESHIP


527
0:55:40,47 --> 0:55:43,973
IN SPIDERLY CRAFTS.


528
0:55:43,973 --> 0:55:47,143
A BABY BOLAS SPIDER ALREADY


529
0:55:47,143 --> 0:55:47,143
SHE'S SM


530
0:55:47,143 --> 0:55:50,779
TIP.


531
0:55:50,779 --> 0:55:52,848
AND THE SCENT SHE USES FOR BAIT


532
0:55:52,848 --> 0:55:56,685
NOW LURES A MUCH SMALLER
KIND OF MOTH.


533
0:55:56,685 --> 0:56:1,324
A YOUNG NET-CASTING SPIDER
MAKES A PERFECT MINIATURE NET.


534
0:56:1,324 --> 0:56:3,592
A TINY ORB-WEAVING SPIDER


535
0:56:3,592 --> 0:56:6,629
A BORN ENGINEER
WITH A GENETIC BLUEPRINT


536
0:56:6,629 --> 0:56:12,601
IS MAKING ITS VERY FIRST WEB.


537
0:56:12,601 --> 0:56:15,704
THINGS CAN GET CONFUSING
IN A CONFINED SPACE


538
0:56:15,704 --> 0:56:35,224
WITH SO MANY SIBLINGS AROUND.


539
0:56:35,224 --> 0:56:52,208
BUT SOON IT ALL GOES
LIKE CLOCKWORK.


540
0:56:52,208 --> 0:56:55,611
THESE LITTLE SPIDERS
WILL EVENTUALLY SPREAD OUT


541
0:56:55,611 --> 0:56:58,13
INTO THEIR SEPARATE TERRITORIES.


542
0:56:58,13 --> 0:57:1,184
MANY WILL SPAN THE EARTH
ON SILKEN BRIDGES.


543
0:57:1,184 --> 0:57:4,287
OTHERS WILL LAUNCH THEMSELVES
INTO THE AIR


544
0:57:4,287 --> 0:57:6,222
TO BE CARRIED FAR AND WIDE


545
0:57:6,222 --> 0:57:9,192
BUT ALL WILL BE
THE SCOURGE OF INSECTS--


546
0:57:9,192 --> 0:57:21,36
MASTERS OF DECEPTION
AND WEAVERS OF WONDER.


547
0:57:21,36 --> 0:57:23,106
THAT SPECTACULAR SPIDER FOOTAGE


548
0:57:23,106 --> 0:57:25,941
IS THE WORK OF A UNIQUE TEAM
OF FILMMAKERS:


549
0:57:25,941 --> 0:57:28,611
AUSTRALIANS JIM FRAZIER
AND DENSEY CLYNE.


550
0:57:28,611 --> 0:57:31,38
WHEN WE COME BACK,
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU


551
0:57:31,38 --> 0:57:34,75
FOR A SPECIAL LOOK
AT THEIR WORLD.

577
1:1:22,945 --> 1:1:25,514
AUSTRALIANS JIM FRAZIER
AND DENSEY CLYNE


578
1:1:25,514 --> 1:1:29,117
ARE ONE OF THE PREMIER COUPLES
OF THE FILMMAKING WORLD.


579
1:1:29,117 --> 1:1:31,487
THEY'RE MARRIED--
NOT TO EACH OTHER--


580
1:1:31,487 --> 1:1:33,889
BUT TO A WORLD
MOST PEOPLE NEVER SEE:


581
1:1:33,889 --> 1:1:35,558
THE WORLD OF MICRO-ACTION


582
1:1:35,558 --> 1:1:38,193
WHERE THE STARS
ARE CATERPILLARS, SPIDERS


583
1:1:38,193 --> 1:1:40,128
AND THE OCCASIONAL RIFLEBIRD.


584
1:1:40,128 --> 1:1:49,171
AND NOW, JIM AND DENSEY
BEHIND THE WEB.


585
1:1:49,171 --> 1:1:56,211
Narrator:
TO BE IN PICTURES,
A SPIDER'S GOT TO LOOK TERRIFIC.


586
1:1:56,211 --> 1:1:59,281
AND TO BE DAZZLING ENOUGH
FOR THE MOVIES


587
1:1:59,281 --> 1:2:6,288
EVEN NATURE NEEDS
PROFESSIONAL HELP.


588
1:2:6,288 --> 1:2:8,791
MAKING SOME OF
THE SMALLEST CREATURES


589
1:2:8,791 --> 1:2:10,559
LOOK THEIR BEST ON CAMERA


590
1:2:10,559 --> 1:2:15,33
IS THE BUSINESS OF
THESE TWO AUSTRALIANS...


591
1:2:15,33 --> 1:2:26,241
AND THEY'RE GOOD AT IT.


592
1:2:26,241 --> 1:2:28,76
JIM FRAZIER AND DENSEY CLYNE


593
1:2:28,76 --> 1:2:30,546
ARE AWARD-WINNING
WILDLIFE FILMMAKERS.


594
1:2:30,546 --> 1:2:32,214
HE'S A CAMERAMAN.


595
1:2:32,214 --> 1:2:34,116
SHE'S A NATURALIST AND WRITER


596
1:2:34,116 --> 1:2:37,52
WHO BEGAN HER CAREER
AS A STILL PHOTOGRAPHER.


597
1:2:37,52 --> 1:2:38,921
Clyne:
MOST OF MY PHOTOGRAPHY


598
1:2:38,921 --> 1:2:40,523
IS DONE OUTDOORS


599
1:2:40,523 --> 1:2:42,858
BECAUSE I LIKE TO BE
OUT IN THE BUSH


600
1:2:42,858 --> 1:2:45,994
AND I LIKE TO FIND THE INSECTS
DOING THEIR THING


601
1:2:45,994 --> 1:2:47,996
AND PHOTOGRAPH THEM NATURALLY.


602
1:2:47,996 --> 1:2:51,5
BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN
I HAVE TO USE A STUDIO SETUP.


603
1:2:51,5 --> 1:2:55,638
WITH VERY SMALL INSECTS,
YOU CAN CONTROL THEM MUCH BETTER


604
1:2:55,638 --> 1:2:59,107
IF YOU'VE GOT THEM, FOR
INSTANCE, ON A STEM OR A LEAF--


605
1:2:59,107 --> 1:3:2,445
CONFINED TO THAT AREA.


606
1:3:2,445 --> 1:3:5,47
THEY'RE REALLY AT YOUR MERCY.


607
1:3:5,47 --> 1:3:7,182
SO THERE YOU CAN
LET YOUR HEAD GO


608
1:3:7,182 --> 1:3:10,786
AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING
TO GET A SHOT.


609
1:3:10,786 --> 1:3:14,256
Narrator:
JIM'S SPECIALTY
IS MOVING PICTURES.


610
1:3:14,256 --> 1:3:17,159
Frazier:
I BECAME INTERESTED
IN PHOTOGRAPHY


611
1:3:17,159 --> 1:3:19,562
APPROXIMATELY 20 YEARS AGO.


612
1:3:19,562 --> 1:3:21,497
DENSEY WAS INTRODUCED TO ME


613
1:3:21,497 --> 1:3:24,767
AND SHE WAS TAKING
THESE WONDERFUL PHOTOGRAPHS


614
1:3:24,767 --> 1:3:28,704
AND I THOUGHT, "GEE, I'D LOVE
TO HAVE A GO AT THAT"


615
1:3:28,704 --> 1:3:32,741
AND I'D NEVER EVEN HANDLED
A CAMERA BEFORE.


616
1:3:32,741 --> 1:3:36,244
AND WHEN I FINALLY STARTED
WORKING WITH DENSEY


617
1:3:36,244 --> 1:3:39,548
SHE TAUGHT ME THE RUDIMENTS
OF PHOTOGRAPHY


618
1:3:39,548 --> 1:3:44,753
AND I GUESS MY WHOLE CAREER
GREW FROM THAT POINT ON.


619
1:3:44,753 --> 1:3:48,657
Narrator:
FOR JIM TO ACTUALLY PRODUCE
THE SHOTS HE DREAMS UP


620
1:3:48,657 --> 1:3:51,794
HE'S BECOME MORE
THAN A CINEMATOGRAPHER.


621
1:3:51,794 --> 1:3:53,596
HE'S ALSO AN INVENTOR.


622
1:3:53,596 --> 1:3:57,933
Frazier:
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS
WITH FILMING WILDLIFE IS


623
1:3:57,933 --> 1:4:2,37
THAT MOST OF THE LENSES THAT
ARE AVAILABLE ON THE SHELVES


624
1:4:2,37 --> 1:4:5,7
DON'T NECESSARILY DO
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO<i> </i>


625
1:4:5,7 --> 1:4:8,243
SO I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN FORCED
TO BUILD LENSES


626
1:4:8,243 --> 1:4:11,614
TO DO THE SORTS OF THINGS
THAT I'VE ENVISAGED.


627
1:4:11,614 --> 1:4:14,282
ONE OF THE SUCCESSFUL
LENSES IS THIS ONE.


628
1:4:14,282 --> 1:4:17,553
FOR INSTANCE, IF YOU WANT
A SHOT FROM GROUND LEVEL


629
1:4:17,553 --> 1:4:20,823
LOOKING AT THE ACTUAL
SPECIMEN IN FRONT


630
1:4:20,823 --> 1:4:23,826
IT PUTS A LOT OF IT IN FOCUS


631
1:4:23,826 --> 1:4:32,1
AND YOU GET THEIR EYE-VIEW
OF THE WORLD.


632
1:4:32,1 --> 1:4:35,871
NOW, THIS PARTICULAR ONE
I'VE USED A LOT ON BUTTERFLIES


633
1:4:35,871 --> 1:4:35,871
FLIES


634
1:4:35,871 --> 1:4:40,776
.


635
1:4:40,776 --> 1:4:43,546
BUT BY MOVING THE LENS LIKE THIS


636
1:4:43,546 --> 1:4:46,882
YOU'RE ACTUALLY
ACHIEVING CRANES.


637
1:4:46,882 --> 1:4:50,385
THE LENS THAT HAS COME
TO MOST ATTENTION


638
1:4:50,385 --> 1:4:53,956
IS THIS LITTLE SECRET
IN THE BLACK BOX.


639
1:4:53,956 --> 1:4:56,158
Narrator:
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE


640
1:4:56,158 --> 1:4:59,962
BUT DAVID ATTENBOROUGH
ISN'T POSING WITH A MONSTER.


641
1:4:59,962 --> 1:5:2,264
IT'S AN INCH-LONG CATERPILLAR.


642
1:5:2,264 --> 1:5:6,902
THE ILLUSION IS A RESULT OF ONE
OF JIM'S OPTICAL INNOVATIONS.


643
1:5:6,902 --> 1:5:9,672
Frazier:
I'VE COME UP WITH
A CONFIGURATION


644
1:5:9,672 --> 1:5:12,975
THAT PUTS INTO FOCUS
EVERYTHING FROM AN ANT HERE


645
1:5:12,975 --> 1:5:16,45
TO AN ELEPHANT OR MOUNTAINS
IN THE BACKGROUND--


646
1:5:16,45 --> 1:5:17,68
IT DOESN'T MATTER.


647
1:5:17,68 --> 1:5:17,68
I'M REALLY PROUD OF THIS
LITT


648
1:5:17,68 --> 1:5:20,883
 DOES.


649
1:5:20,883 --> 1:5:25,621
Narrator:
FOR THE PHOTOGRAPHERS
AND THEIR ASSISTANT, JOHN YOUNG


650
1:5:25,621 --> 1:5:30,59
FILMMAKING ISN'T ONLY FANCY
EQUIPMENT AND SPECIAL EFFECTS.


651
1:5:30,59 --> 1:5:37,332
IT'S ALSO HANDS-ON WORK
IN THE FIELD.


652
1:5:37,332 --> 1:5:39,34
.


653
1:5:39,34 --> 1:5:42,605
Narrator:
ON THIS MISSION,
THEY WANT TO FILM A BUTTERFLY


654
1:5:42,605 --> 1:5:44,673
AFTER IT EMERGES FROM ITS PUPA.


655
1:5:44,673 --> 1:5:47,943
THE PROBLEM IS, THIS
PARTICULAR PUPA LIVES EMBEDDED


656
1:5:47,943 --> 1:5:51,614
IN A NEST OF WEAVER ANTS...


657
1:5:51,614 --> 1:5:56,351
AND WEAVER ANTS STING.


658
1:5:56,351 --> 1:5:57,519
RIGHT.


659
1:5:57,519 --> 1:5:59,922
GOT ONE,
JIM, LOOK!


660
1:5:59,922 --> 1:6:4,59
Frazier:
OH, GREAT,
FANTASTIC!


661
1:6:4,59 --> 1:6:7,229
Narrator:
BACK IN THE STUDIO,
JIM INVENTS A SYSTEM


662
1:6:7,229 --> 1:6:11,767
THAT SOUNDS WHEN THE PUPA
IS ABOUT TO BREAK.


663
1:6:11,767 --> 1:6:17,539
(<i> alarm buzzing</i>  )


664
1:6:17,539 --> 1:6:20,676
AT THE ALARM,
ONLY ONE TASK REMAINS:


665
1:6:20,676 --> 1:6:24,713
RETURNING THE PUPA
TO A NEST FULL OF ANTS.


666
1:6:24,713 --> 1:6:25,848
THESE, TOO.


667
1:6:25,848 --> 1:6:29,785
OH, BEAUTY.


668
1:6:29,785 --> 1:6:34,256
(<i> chirping</i>  )


669
1:6:34,256 --> 1:6:35,824
OKAY.


670
1:6:35,824 --> 1:6:37,392
HIT THE LIGHT, PLEASE.


671
1:6:37,392 --> 1:6:38,827
OH, LOOK AT IT!


672
1:6:38,827 --> 1:6:45,67
OH, BEAUTIFUL!


673
1:6:45,67 --> 1:6:48,537
Narrator:
THE FILMMAKERS GO TO
A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE


674
1:6:48,537 --> 1:6:57,445
BUT IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO GET PICTURES LIKE THESE.


675
1:6:57,445 --> 1:7:1,183
THE PLACE WHERE JIM AND DENSEY
DO MOST OF THEIR FIELDWORK


676
1:7:1,183 --> 1:7:7,489
IS THE AUSTRALIAN RAIN FOREST.


677
1:7:7,489 --> 1:7:16,865
THIS TIME THEY'RE AFTER A BIRD.


678
1:7:16,865 --> 1:7:20,35
TO GET A GOOD VIEW
CLOSE TO THE ACTION


679
1:7:20,35 --> 1:7:25,44
THEY NEED A PLACE TO HIDE.


680
1:7:25,44 --> 1:7:29,244
PLATFORMS IN THE TREETOPS
ARE JOHN YOUNG'S SPECIALTY.


681
1:7:29,244 --> 1:7:33,182
Young:
IT'S AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS
BUSINESS THAT I'M IN


682
1:7:33,182 --> 1:7:35,317
BECAUSE OF THE CLIMBING ASPECTS.


683
1:7:35,317 --> 1:7:37,786
ONE HAS TO BE SO CAREFUL


684
1:7:37,786 --> 1:7:45,6
HE HAS TO KNOW THE TIMBER
YOU CLIMB, THE TREES.


685
1:7:45,6 --> 1:7:46,995
Frazier:
THIS PARTICULAR TREE


686
1:7:46,995 --> 1:7:49,932
WE'RE PUTTING A HIDE IN
AT THE MOMENT


687
1:7:49,932 --> 1:7:54,402
IT'S CALLED A CODAHI--
ONE OF THOSE REALLY BRITTLE GUMS


688
1:7:54,402 --> 1:7:57,106
AND JOHN KNOWS THEM
ONLY TOO WELL.


689
1:7:57,106 --> 1:8:2,1
HE KNOWS WHAT SIZE BRANCH
WILL SUPPORT WHAT WEIGHT


690
1:8:2,1 --> 1:8:4,179
AND THAT'S WHAT I RELY ON.


691
1:8:4,179 --> 1:8:6,715
SOME OF THESE THINGS,
LIKE THIS ONE


692
1:8:6,715 --> 1:8:8,583
WILL SNAP JUST LIKE A CARROT


693
1:8:8,583 --> 1:8:20,528
AND THEY DON'T GIVE YOU
ANY 


694
1:8:20,528 --> 1:8:24,666
Narrator:
THE BIRD JIM AND DENSEY
WANT TO FILM HAS BEEN ELUSIVE


695
1:8:24,666 --> 1:8:28,837
AND IT'S KEPT THEM REVISITING
THEIR HIDEOUT FOR MONTHS NOW--


696
1:8:28,837 --> 1:8:31,6
OFTEN FOR DAYS AT A TIME.


697
1:8:31,6 --> 1:8:33,575
Frazier:
IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE PLEASANT


698
1:8:33,575 --> 1:8:36,945
SITTING UP IN A HIDE
IN THE RAIN FOREST FILMING.


699
1:8:36,945 --> 1:8:40,615
YOU TEND TO NOTICE EVERYTHING
THAT MOVES AROUND YOU


700
1:8:40,615 --> 1:8:43,218
AND SO WHILE YOU MAY BE
CONCENTRATING


701
1:8:43,218 --> 1:8:45,62
ON ONE PARTICULAR SUBJECT


702
1:8:45,62 --> 1:8:47,322
YOU CAN'T HELP BUT SEE


703
1:8:47,322 --> 1:8:49,457
EVERYTHING ELSE
THAT'S HAPPENING.


704
1:8:49,457 --> 1:8:51,26
THAT'S THE FASCINATING PART


705
1:8:51,26 --> 1:8:55,33
AND THAT KEEPS YOU ALIVE,
THAT KEEPS YOU VIBRANT.


706
1:8:55,33 --> 1:8:55,33
THES


707
1:8:55,33 --> 1:8:57,632
TING


708
1:8:57,632 --> 1:9:0,535
BUT THEY'RE NOT WHAT THE
FILMMAKERS ARE LOOKING FOR.


709
1:9:0,535 --> 1:9:3,705
THEY WANT THE RIFLEBIRD.


710
1:9:3,705 --> 1:9:6,708
(<i> squawks</i> )


711
1:9:6,708 --> 1:9:9,11
JIM WANTS TO FILM
THIS BIRD MATING--


712
1:9:9,11 --> 1:9:13,982
SOMETHING WHICH HAS NEVER
BEEN PHOTOGRAPHED BEFORE.


713
1:9:13,982 --> 1:10:10,5
ALL THE RIFLEBIRD WANTS
IS A FEMALE.


714
1:10:10,5 --> 1:10:16,78
JUST WHEN THE FEMALE SEEMS
AGREEABLE, SHE CHANGES HER MIND.


715
1:10:16,78 --> 1:10:23,585
(<i> screeches</i> )


716
1:10:23,585 --> 1:10:27,555
THE RIFLEBIRD ISN'T
THE ONLY ONE LET DOWN.


717
1:10:27,555 --> 1:10:31,96
JIM AND DENSEY HAVE WAITED IN
THE BLIND SEVEN DAYS FOR THIS.


718
1:10:31,96 --> 1:10:45,573
BUT THE VERY NEXT DAY,
EVERYONE GETS SATISFACTION.


719
1:10:45,573 --> 1:10:57,219
THE RIFLEBIRD ESPECIALLY
HAS SOMETHING TO CROW ABOUT.


720
1:10:57,219 --> 1:10:59,687
SHOWING US NATURE'S
SMALL CREATURES


721
1:10:59,687 --> 1:11:1,456
AS WE RARELY SEE THEM


722
1:11:1,456 --> 1:11:4,893
IS JIM AND DENSEY'S BUSINESS...
AND THEIR PLEASURE.


723
1:11:4,893 --> 1:11:7,595
IT'S A LIFE THEY ALMOST
SEEM MADE FOR.


724
1:11:7,595 --> 1:11:7,595
Clyne:


725
1:11:7,595 --> 1:11:10,732
.


726
1:11:10,732 --> 1:11:14,536
I LIKE TO FEEL FREE.


727
1:11:14,536 --> 1:11:16,671
JIM AND I BOTH LIKE THAT BEST--


728
1:11:16,671 --> 1:11:21,43
TO BE FREE, OUT THERE
IN THE BUSH, WITH OUR CAMERAS


729
1:11:21,43 --> 1:11:27,549
JUST LOOKING,
SEEING WHAT WE CAN FIND.


730
1:11:27,549 --> 1:11:30,152
Frazier:
I GUESS I WOULDN'T SWAP IT


731
1:11:30,152 --> 1:11:32,254
FOR ANY OTHER LIFE IN THE WORLD.


732
1:11:32,254 --> 1:11:33,788
IT'S GREAT.


733
1:11:33,788 --> 1:11:37,659
YOU DON'T MAKE A LOT OF MONEY
OUT OF MAKING WILDLIFE FILMS.


734
1:11:37,659 --> 1:11:39,727
IN FACT, YOU LIVE QUITE POORLY.


735
1:11:39,727 --> 1:11:42,464
BUT THIS SORT OF LIFESTYLE


736
1:11:42,464 --> 1:11:46,634
OF BEING OUT HERE
LEARNING ABOUT ANIMALS


737
1:11:46,634 --> 1:11:51,44
AND WATCHING ANIMALS DO
EXTRAORDINARY THINGS--


738
1:11:51,44 --> 1:13:51,44
THERE'S NO JOB
IN AN OFFICE IN A CITY
