###14 SHANE SMITH: So this is the scene of a film that the
###18 General Kim Jong-Il directed?
###20 MR. KIM: Yes.
###21 He likes the film very much.
###25 SHANE SMITH: The first thing you realize is this isn't a
###28 film studio, it's a museum.
###30 No one's making any films here.
###32 It's yet another shrine to this guy.
###34 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###35 
###86 SHANE SMITH: So, the North Koreans believe that he
###89 invented the whole concept of multi-camera shoots in 1964.
###94 In fact, they believe he's so great at making films that
###97 they made a film about how great he is at making films.
###100 MALE SPEAKER: Visiting the filming [INAUDIBLE]
###103 he taught the cameraman and actors how to shoot and act.
###106 
###110 This resulted in the creation of masterpieces that teach man
###114 the truth of life and destiny.
###115 
###121 SHANE SMITH: And my favorite thing is, if you're a little
###123 unsure as to what exactly Kim Jong-Il did on this film, what
###126 was his role, there's a list.
###129 
###131 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###133 
###152 SHANE SMITH: So he gave on-the-spot
###154 guidance how many times?
###155 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###157 
###159 MALE SPEAKER: 350.
###161 More than 350 times.
###162 SHANE SMITH: He came here 350 times, but he gave 11,000
###168 phone calls?
###168 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###170 
###204 SHANE SMITH: We got it now.
###206 The General Kim Jong-Il came here 350 times.
###209 He gave 1,770 directions, but also 11,890 guidances.
###216 And these are all of those things categorized here.
###220 I'm not going to ask what 8941 is, because when I asked what
###223 the 11890 was, it caused quite a stir.
###226 
###231 It's kind of like Twentieth Century Fox or something.
###234 
###237 They took us rapidly from room to room to room.
###239 Some rooms we could shoot, some rooms we couldn't.
###242 I don't know why.
###243 We could shoot the camera room, but we couldn't shoot
###245 the Soviet Mixing Board.
###246 No more shooting?
###247 MR. KIM: From this moment.
###248 SHANE SMITH: From this moment?
###248 OK.
###250 
###256 They've got recreations of their meals that they used to
###259 eat when they were filming in the 1960s.
###262 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###263 
###270 MR. PAK:
###272 
###275 SHANE SMITH: He played the guitar?
###277 MR. PAK:
###280 SHANE SMITH: But he saw the guitar?
###281 MR. PAK:
###282 
###301 SHANE SMITH: He was giving on-the-spot guidance with this
###303 camera, and they kept this camera here.
###305 Can I look?
###305 MR. KIM: Yes.
###306 MR. PAK: Yes, you can.
###306 SHANE SMITH: Thank you.
###307 So I'm looking into the same camera that the General Kim
###312 Jong-Il looked through.
###314 I can see things.
###316 I can see marvelous things.
###318 
###333 So this is kind of like their equivalent of [INAUDIBLE], the
###336 Wild West town.
###337 And they'll have the saloon and whatever.
###339 This is their equivalent to make Asian history films.
###343 And do they have a Japanese or American street?
###347 MR. KIM: Yes.
###348 There is the Chinese street, the Japanese street, and
###351 European street, and also the [INAUDIBLE]
###354 street.
###355 SHANE SMITH: Can we see a European street?
###357 MR. KIM: They are repairing now.
###358 SHANE SMITH: Repairing it?
###359 MR. KIM: If they see a disliking to see you.
###363 SHANE SMITH: They don't want to see us?
###364 MR. KIM: Right, they don't want to see you.
###365 SHANE SMITH: OK.
###366 MR. PAK:
###367 
###370 SHANE SMITH: We have to go?
###371 MR. PAK:
###372 SHANE SMITH: They're now kicking us
###373 out for some reason.
###374 We asked to see the European street and the American street
###376 which they blow up when they blow up America, but they
###380 won't let us see it.
###381 And now we have to go [INAUDIBLE].
###382 But we're on the film set in Pyongyang Studios.
###390 When we finally got into the film studios in North Korea, I
###393 expected to be taken to a sound stage, or see people
###396 filming, making movies.
###397 But we just got another museum.
###399 It was a facade.
###401 And like the Arirang Games, it's just a show.
###403 
###407 And you realize they're doing all of this
###409 for the Dear Leader.
###411 
###414 It's Nero.
###416 As Rome is burning, we need the spectacle.
###419 
###423 The DMZ, the People's Library, the Juche Ideals, the Arirang
###427 Games, it's just a bunch of sound and fury
###430 that signifies nothing.
