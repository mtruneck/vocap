2
0:0:0,15 --> 0:0:1,22
MALE SPEAKER: One, two, three.


3
0:0:1,22 --> 0:0:9,6
[MUSIC PLAYING]


4
0:0:9,6 --> 0:0:10,79
TRAVIS WAMMACK: It's
the South.


5
0:0:10,79 --> 0:0:13,61
It's growing up poor,
teaching yourself,


6
0:0:13,61 --> 0:0:16,506
playing from the heart.


7
0:0:16,506 --> 0:0:18,24
I don't think the
sound that was


8
0:0:18,24 --> 0:0:21,98
created in here was planned.


9
0:0:21,98 --> 0:0:24,5
DONNIE FRITZ: The key word
to me about Muscle


10
0:0:24,5 --> 0:0:26,538
Shoals, it's a groove.


11
0:0:26,538 --> 0:0:40,38
[MUSIC PLAYING]


12
0:0:40,38 --> 0:0:40,91
IAN SVENONIUS: Here we are.


13
0:0:40,91 --> 0:0:42,45
We're in Muscle Shoals,
Alabama.


14
0:0:42,45 --> 0:0:45,98
Muscle Shoals is known
for a lot of things.


15
0:0:45,98 --> 0:0:48,3
It's known for Reynolds Wrap.


16
0:0:48,3 --> 0:0:51,1
And it's known for
being a swamp.


17
0:0:51,1 --> 0:0:53,74
But it's mostly known
for American music.


18
0:0:53,74 --> 0:0:58,26
The studios Muscle Shoals Sound
and Fame have produced,


19
0:0:58,26 --> 0:1:0,92
you know, Wilson Pickett
records, Percy Sledge records,


20
0:1:0,92 --> 0:1:5,36
Rolling Stones, and everything
up to Lynard Skynard, the


21
0:1:5,36 --> 0:1:7,92
Osmond's, and the
group Alabama.


22
0:1:7,92 --> 0:1:11,92
We wanted to explore what made
this region such a fertile


23
0:1:11,92 --> 0:1:13,25
musical region.


24
0:1:13,25 --> 0:1:15,61
We're talking to the people who
have worked here, who've


25
0:1:15,61 --> 0:1:18,67
established Muscle Shoals,
put it on the map.


26
0:1:18,67 --> 0:1:21,9
And we're going to talk to the
young people who are trying to


27
0:1:21,9 --> 0:1:22,134
make their own way.


28
0:1:22,134 --> 0:1:24,85
[MUSIC PLAYING]


29
0:1:24,85 --> 0:1:27,71
IAN SVENONIUS: So much music now
is based on the music that


30
0:1:27,71 --> 0:1:28,48
was made here.


31
0:1:28,48 --> 0:1:31,21
What are the central ingredients
of that sound?


32
0:1:31,21 --> 0:1:33,69
DOC DAILEY: When I think of the
Muscle Shoals sound, like,


33
0:1:33,69 --> 0:1:37,445
from the old recording era, I
think more of an R&B feel.


34
0:1:37,445 --> 0:1:39,35
But that's kind of what
I think about.


35
0:1:39,35 --> 0:1:43,13
I think it's probably more
of a recording legacy.


36
0:1:43,13 --> 0:1:46,11
You know, we had all the great
session players here and


37
0:1:46,11 --> 0:1:47,98
studios back in the day--


38
0:1:47,98 --> 0:1:49,23
white guys playing soul music.


39
0:1:49,23 --> 0:1:52,12



40
0:1:52,12 --> 0:1:54,54
RICK HALL: We all started
out as pickers.


41
0:1:54,54 --> 0:1:58,3
We all had our own bands
and we all played gigs.


42
0:1:58,3 --> 0:2:0,29
And the odds were against us.


43
0:2:0,29 --> 0:2:3,74
We're recording in a town of
5,000 people where you only


44
0:2:3,74 --> 0:2:6,23
have four good guitar players.


45
0:2:6,23 --> 0:2:9,68
You only have three
good song writers.


46
0:2:9,68 --> 0:2:10,66
It's a dry county.


47
0:2:10,66 --> 0:2:13,51
You can't buy booze
or even beer here.


48
0:2:13,51 --> 0:2:15,83
And the thing we have going
for us in spite of all of


49
0:2:15,83 --> 0:2:19,27
that, we were cutting hit
records because we worked


50
0:2:19,27 --> 0:2:24,41
harder, longer, and were more
driven, and felt the pressure


51
0:2:24,41 --> 0:2:25,68
to be competitive
with the world.


52
0:2:25,68 --> 0:2:29,16



53
0:2:29,16 --> 0:2:32,29
DONNIE FRITZ: We were just
kids and learning.


54
0:2:32,29 --> 0:2:35,3
But it was a young business.


55
0:2:35,3 --> 0:2:38,93
It'd only been like three or
four years since Elvis and all


56
0:2:38,93 --> 0:2:40,98
these guys from Memphis
started.


57
0:2:40,98 --> 0:2:41,25
SCOTT BOYER: Yeah.


58
0:2:41,25 --> 0:2:43,19
IAN SVENONIUS: First of all,
I want to asked how you got


59
0:2:43,19 --> 0:2:44,75
started, how you got the job?


60
0:2:44,75 --> 0:2:47,28
DAVID HOOD: Well, I started
hanging around Fame which was


61
0:2:47,28 --> 0:2:48,63
just down the street
from the store.


62
0:2:48,63 --> 0:2:51,136
I was working at my father's
tire store.


63
0:2:51,136 --> 0:2:55,6
And my first union scale
recording session was a hit, a


64
0:2:55,6 --> 0:2:55,57
gold record.


65
0:2:55,57 --> 0:2:56,99
And I had to start learning
how to play


66
0:2:56,99 --> 0:2:58,77
the base after that.


67
0:2:58,77 --> 0:3:1,67
RICK HALL: We started out
with a little funky


68
0:3:1,67 --> 0:3:3,28
demonstration studio.


69
0:3:3,28 --> 0:3:6,395
We stapled egg cartons
on the walls.


70
0:3:6,395 --> 0:3:9,7
And that was in Florence,
Alabama, that's where Fame got


71
0:3:9,7 --> 0:3:12,25
its name, of course, Florence,
Alabama Music Enterprises.


72
0:3:12,25 --> 0:3:14,73
DAVID HOOD: This is the
legendary Rick Hall who


73
0:3:14,73 --> 0:3:18,752
produced Arthur Alexander and
the first hits that were from


74
0:3:18,752 --> 0:3:19,25
around here.


75
0:3:19,25 --> 0:3:23,61
He would find a song or an
artist and go in and record


76
0:3:23,61 --> 0:3:25,24
that artist with that song.


77
0:3:25,24 --> 0:3:27,19
And then he'd go shop
it and try to get it


78
0:3:27,19 --> 0:3:28,99
played on the radio.


79
0:3:28,99 --> 0:3:29,99
RICK HALL: I went on a tour.


80
0:3:29,99 --> 0:3:32,225
We called it the Great
Vodka Tour.


81
0:3:32,225 --> 0:3:35,11
And any black station that had
a tower, I'd take them a


82
0:3:35,11 --> 0:3:38,39
bottle of vodka, or a bottle
of gin, or whatever.


83
0:3:38,39 --> 0:3:41,17
Then we left town and we're
driving down the highway.


84
0:3:41,17 --> 0:3:42,72
And we took a swig a vodka.


85
0:3:42,72 --> 0:3:43,39
And said, hey.


86
0:3:43,39 --> 0:3:44,384
They're playing our record.


87
0:3:44,384 --> 0:3:45,38
IAN SVENONIUS: Yeah.


88
0:3:45,38 --> 0:3:46,72
RICK HALL: It also started
out with black music.


89
0:3:46,72 --> 0:3:47,235
IAN SVENONIUS: Yeah.


90
0:3:47,235 --> 0:3:48,963
RICK HALL: And I want
to make that clear.


91
0:3:48,963 --> 0:3:54,84
[MUSIC PLAYING]


92
0:3:54,84 --> 0:3:55,75
IAN SVENONIUS: Wilson
Pickett came in.


93
0:3:55,75 --> 0:3:58,1
This was after he was in
the Falcons and was--


94
0:3:58,1 --> 0:3:59,6
DAVID HOOD: Yes.


95
0:3:59,6 --> 0:4:3,18
They recorded "Midnight Hour"
at Stax in Memphis.


96
0:4:3,18 --> 0:4:5,74
And it was their
first big hit.


97
0:4:5,74 --> 0:4:9,28
And Jim Stewart, who owned Stax,
said, well, look, we're


98
0:4:9,28 --> 0:4:11,54
not going to let you guys come
back in here and record


99
0:4:11,54 --> 0:4:12,37
anymore stuff.


100
0:4:12,37 --> 0:4:15,49
I want everything to be for
Stax that's recorded here.


101
0:4:15,49 --> 0:4:17,329
And so Jerry Wexler started
looking for


102
0:4:17,329 --> 0:4:18,51
another place to record.


103
0:4:18,51 --> 0:4:20,635
And that's when he
brought Pickett.


104
0:4:20,635 --> 0:4:24,68
What really got Muscle Shoals
music happening was Jerry


105
0:4:24,68 --> 0:4:26,82
Wexler bringing Wilson
Pickett and then


106
0:4:26,82 --> 0:4:28,7
later on, Aretha Franklin.


107
0:4:28,7 --> 0:4:32,12



108
0:4:32,12 --> 0:4:34,63
RICK HALL: It's a little strange
when you are a white


109
0:4:34,63 --> 0:4:38,55
cracker from the State of
Alabama and you become known


110
0:4:38,55 --> 0:4:42,19
as a producer who produced
only blacks acts.


111
0:4:42,19 --> 0:4:45,34
So when you get to the Rolling
Stones, and Otis Redding, and


112
0:4:45,34 --> 0:4:47,73
on and on, you start to
make your mark and


113
0:4:47,73 --> 0:4:48,62
the word gets out.


114
0:4:48,62 --> 0:4:50,2
Wait a minute?


115
0:4:50,2 --> 0:4:52,462
What's going on down in Muscle
Shoals, Alabama?


116
0:4:52,462 --> 0:4:56,89
[MUSIC PLAYING]


117
0:4:56,89 --> 0:4:59,63
IAN SVENONIUS: What makes this
area so musical or whatever?


118
0:4:59,63 --> 0:5:2,185
Or do you think it's anymore
musical than any other places?


119
0:5:2,185 --> 0:5:4,38
DOC DAILEY: Oh, it's definitely
more musical than


120
0:5:4,38 --> 0:5:5,54
other places.


121
0:5:5,54 --> 0:5:6,38
IAN SVENONIUS: Is
it the water?


122
0:5:6,38 --> 0:5:8,61
DOC DAILEY: That's what they
talk about, the singing river.


123
0:5:8,61 --> 0:5:9,0
IAN SVENONIUS: Really?


124
0:5:9,0 --> 0:5:9,36
The river?


125
0:5:9,36 --> 0:5:10,5
That's interesting.


126
0:5:10,5 --> 0:5:10,37
DOC DAILEY: Yes.


127
0:5:10,37 --> 0:5:11,12
That's what they say.


128
0:5:11,12 --> 0:5:13,96
There's supposedly an Indian
legend that there's a lady in


129
0:5:13,96 --> 0:5:15,8
the river that sings.


130
0:5:15,8 --> 0:5:17,7
And you can actually hear her.


131
0:5:17,7 --> 0:5:18,222
IAN SVENONIUS: Does
she sing well?


132
0:5:18,222 --> 0:5:19,146
DOC DAILEY: I've never
heard her.


133
0:5:19,146 --> 0:5:20,7
[LAUGHTER]


134
0:5:20,7 --> 0:5:23,15
RICK HALL: People started
migrating here from other


135
0:5:23,15 --> 0:5:26,28
areas of the country, from
California, from Los Angeles,


136
0:5:26,28 --> 0:5:27,9
from New Orleans,
and everywhere.


137
0:5:27,9 --> 0:5:31,16
DAVID HOOD: I think that they
came here because they had


138
0:5:31,16 --> 0:5:34,2
heard a record or something,
a hit that was recorded.


139
0:5:34,2 --> 0:5:36,98
And they came because they
wanted a hit too.


140
0:5:36,98 --> 0:5:39,1
RICK HALL: So it's not where
you're at, it's the


141
0:5:39,1 --> 0:5:41,2
determination you have.


142
0:5:41,2 --> 0:5:43,21
New York didn't want me and Los
Angeles didn't want me.


143
0:5:43,21 --> 0:5:47,47
So it was either Muscle
Shoals, or nothing.


144
0:5:47,47 --> 0:5:49,73
I just decided to plant myself
here and said, look,


145
0:5:49,73 --> 0:5:50,64
I'm going to do it.


146
0:5:50,64 --> 0:5:53,8
I don't care if it was Wilson
Pickett, or Clarence Carter,


147
0:5:53,8 --> 0:5:56,6
or Aretha Franklin, or Mack
Davis, or Elvis Presley,


148
0:5:56,6 --> 0:5:59,95
whoever it was, if I was
producing the record, the


149
0:5:59,95 --> 0:6:2,42
record became my record.


150
0:6:2,42 --> 0:6:4,78
And what you heard
on the record was


151
0:6:4,78 --> 0:6:6,74
what I wanted to hear.


152
0:6:6,74 --> 0:6:9,18
TRAVIS WAMMACK: Back then, we
were an exclusive for Fame.


153
0:6:9,18 --> 0:6:11,56
And we were punching the
clock from 9:00 to


154
0:6:11,56 --> 0:6:13,115
I think 5:00 everyday.


155
0:6:13,115 --> 0:6:14,59
And you had to be busy.


156
0:6:14,59 --> 0:6:17,8
You had to be writing or doing
something, you know.


157
0:6:17,8 --> 0:6:19,84
IAN SVENONIUS: The Fame Rhythm
Section moved over to Muscle


158
0:6:19,84 --> 0:6:21,85
Shoals, started their
own thing.


159
0:6:21,85 --> 0:6:24,67
Did you see that as like a
threat to what you were doing


160
0:6:24,67 --> 0:6:29,22
or were you excited that this
was becoming, like, growth of


161
0:6:29,22 --> 0:6:30,91
a new music center?


162
0:6:30,91 --> 0:6:33,72
RICK HALL: Well, I was certainly
proud of the fact


163
0:6:33,72 --> 0:6:36,89
that I felt like a teacher
of a bunch of guys


164
0:6:36,89 --> 0:6:39,13
that were making it.


165
0:6:39,13 --> 0:6:43,23
And I was dumb enough not to
know that they were to almost


166
0:6:43,23 --> 0:6:45,376
put me out of business.


167
0:6:45,376 --> 0:6:48,68
DAVID HOOD: The Muscle Shoals
Rhythm Section were the rhythm


168
0:6:48,68 --> 0:6:52,69
section at Fame before we left
and started Muscle Shoals


169
0:6:52,69 --> 0:6:53,7
Sound Studios.


170
0:6:53,7 --> 0:6:56,9
And so when we left, Rick was a
little pissed off at us for


171
0:6:56,9 --> 0:6:58,2
leaving him.


172
0:6:58,2 --> 0:7:2,6
But he went right ahead and cut
hit records without us.


173
0:7:2,6 --> 0:7:4,17
RICK HALL: They was so good at
what they had done, and they


174
0:7:4,17 --> 0:7:9,63
had learned so well that they
were kicking my ass.


175
0:7:9,63 --> 0:7:12,49
DAVID HOOD: When Rick started
having his success as a


176
0:7:12,49 --> 0:7:15,99
result, me, guys I work with,
all of the sudden people


177
0:7:15,99 --> 0:7:19,31
thought that we were
experts almost.


178
0:7:19,31 --> 0:7:21,78
And so you think, well,
maybe I am.


179
0:7:21,78 --> 0:7:23,9
DONNIE FRITZ: Well, just one
thing led to another.


180
0:7:23,9 --> 0:7:27,69
And it just build up
to what it became.


181
0:7:27,69 --> 0:7:33,42
But it was those early days of
young people learning as we


182
0:7:33,42 --> 0:7:34,47
went along, you know.


183
0:7:34,47 --> 0:7:39,85
[MUSIC PLAYING]


184
0:7:39,85 --> 0:7:41,59
JAMIE BARRIER: The Fame,
like, Ben Tanner


185
0:7:41,59 --> 0:7:42,85
used to work in there.


186
0:7:42,85 --> 0:7:44,44
And he let us come
in at night.


187
0:7:44,44 --> 0:7:47,48
And we wrote songs and we
had killer microphones.


188
0:7:47,48 --> 0:7:49,43
It recorded it perfect.


189
0:7:49,43 --> 0:7:52,35
If I go to my brother's house,
this real sassy record player,


190
0:7:52,35 --> 0:7:55,21
you can, like, hear the earth
being ripped apart, you know?


191
0:7:55,21 --> 0:7:58,36
It's was just, like, I thought
it was awesome.


192
0:7:58,36 --> 0:8:1,765
[MUSIC PLAYING]


193
0:8:1,765 --> 0:8:3,325
JAMIE BARRIER: Florence,
Alabama is so--


194
0:8:3,325 --> 0:8:4,532
it's such a corpse.


195
0:8:4,532 --> 0:8:6,52
It's real easy to kick it.


196
0:8:6,52 --> 0:8:10,95
Here it's a wasteland of
abandoned massive buildings.


197
0:8:10,95 --> 0:8:13,65
The potential, if you want to
do it, is, like, unlimited.


198
0:8:13,65 --> 0:8:16,586
It's just a matter of,
well, I'd rather sit


199
0:8:16,586 --> 0:8:17,675
on the couch tonight.


200
0:8:17,675 --> 0:8:20,73
And, like, watch television
or getting up and


201
0:8:20,73 --> 0:8:21,36
doing it, you know.


202
0:8:21,36 --> 0:8:23,8
That's like your main battle.


203
0:8:23,8 --> 0:8:27,8
It's hard to make a living off
of art anywhere in any town--


204
0:8:27,8 --> 0:8:27,97
anywhere.


205
0:8:27,97 --> 0:8:30,155
I worked at Subway
for seven years.


206
0:8:30,155 --> 0:8:33,7
I'm, like, I put this many hours
into this job and do it


207
0:8:33,7 --> 0:8:38,216
for myself I can
make ends meet.


208
0:8:38,216 --> 0:8:40,254
Yeah, this is the Black
Owl Trading Company


209
0:8:40,254 --> 0:8:41,51
in Florence, Alabama.


210
0:8:41,51 --> 0:8:43,28
I mean, we record bands.


211
0:8:43,28 --> 0:8:44,97
We have touring bands.


212
0:8:44,97 --> 0:8:46,69
And we do screen printing
in there.


213
0:8:46,69 --> 0:8:48,28
And that's the printing wheel.


214
0:8:48,28 --> 0:8:51,85
And this is our old
heat machine.


215
0:8:51,85 --> 0:8:55,6
I listen to reggae records all
day long and screen print.


216
0:8:55,6 --> 0:8:56,32
It's pretty cool.


217
0:8:56,32 --> 0:8:56,87
It's been good.


218
0:8:56,87 --> 0:8:58,93
We used to get a lot of
harassment from the police.


219
0:8:58,93 --> 0:9:3,3
But we quit having a lot of the
high school bands play,


220
0:9:3,3 --> 0:9:4,96
which sucks.


221
0:9:4,96 --> 0:9:8,94
But most of those bands were,
like, hardcore or metal.


222
0:9:8,94 --> 0:9:11,23
Like, we weren't
into the music.


223
0:9:11,23 --> 0:9:14,2
But we would do it just to,
like, just to give them the


224
0:9:14,2 --> 0:9:16,18
place to play.


225
0:9:16,18 --> 0:9:22,27
The way I learned to do music is
like the DC discord style.


226
0:9:22,27 --> 0:9:26,8
Putting out your own record,
record it yourself for cheap,


227
0:9:26,8 --> 0:9:30,56
put out a zine, load
up the van.


228
0:9:30,56 --> 0:9:32,485
I absolutely love that.


229
0:9:32,485 --> 0:9:33,745
You know what I mean?


230
0:9:33,745 --> 0:9:36,34
If that's what making it
is, that's what I want.


231
0:9:36,34 --> 0:9:57,172
[MUSIC PLAYING]


232
0:9:57,172 --> 0:9:59,6
DOC DAILEY: And there's a lot of
the older guys that'll tell


233
0:9:59,6 --> 0:10:0,4
you a lot of good stories.


234
0:10:0,4 --> 0:10:0,95
That's for sure.


235
0:10:0,95 --> 0:10:3,98
But I think the industry has
just changed so much that


236
0:10:3,98 --> 0:10:6,538
right now it's the wild west
as far as I can tell.


237
0:10:6,538 --> 0:10:13,1
[MUSIC PLAYING]


238
0:10:13,1 --> 0:10:16,39
JD MCCORKLE: In Florence there's
not really, like, a


239
0:10:16,39 --> 0:10:17,48
music venue.


240
0:10:17,48 --> 0:10:20,44
There's bars and they have,
like, a PA system set up.


241
0:10:20,44 --> 0:10:24,82
A big hold back is a
law called 49/51.


242
0:10:24,82 --> 0:10:26,7
You can't have more revenue
coming in from alcohol than


243
0:10:26,7 --> 0:10:27,45
you do food.


244
0:10:27,45 --> 0:10:30,115
It has to be in a
49-51% ratio.


245
0:10:30,115 --> 0:10:32,21
JAMIE BARRIER: I'm like the only
guy that, I don't care


246
0:10:32,21 --> 0:10:33,45
about that law.


247
0:10:33,45 --> 0:10:35,63
All you got to do is clear
furniture out of the room.


248
0:10:35,63 --> 0:10:37,1
You know what I'm saying?


249
0:10:37,1 --> 0:10:39,83
The lousiest nights I ever
have are in bars anyway.


250
0:10:39,83 --> 0:10:40,63
That's just me.


251
0:10:40,63 --> 0:10:43,61
The best times I have are, like,
in those weird kind of


252
0:10:43,61 --> 0:10:46,782
shows in the laundry room.


253
0:10:46,782 --> 0:10:49,87
IAN SVENONIUS: So yeah, what's
it like being in a group here?


254
0:10:49,87 --> 0:10:51,9
DOC DAILEY: Travel a
lot if you want to


255
0:10:51,9 --> 0:10:54,74
really play, you know.


256
0:10:54,74 --> 0:10:55,98
It's not your ideal place.


257
0:10:55,98 --> 0:10:58,64
You know, bands try to tour
through here and we can't find


258
0:10:58,64 --> 0:10:59,73
shows for them.


259
0:10:59,73 --> 0:11:1,24
And people are really beating
down the door to come


260
0:11:1,24 --> 0:11:2,2
through here now.


261
0:11:2,2 --> 0:11:5,82
But you just can't fill the
place on a Monday night or


262
0:11:5,82 --> 0:11:6,36
Tuesday night.


263
0:11:6,36 --> 0:11:10,82
People would rather go and watch
someone cover a song by


264
0:11:10,82 --> 0:11:13,19
a guy that might be playing
down the street,


265
0:11:13,19 --> 0:11:15,36
you know, the original.


266
0:11:15,36 --> 0:11:15,635
IAN SVENONIUS: Yeah,
yeah, yeah.


267
0:11:15,635 --> 0:11:16,73
Yeah.


268

DAVID HOOD: We play on a
Wednesday night, which in the


269
0:11:19,2 --> 0:11:20,32
South, that's church night.


270
0:11:20,32 --> 0:11:23,69
I'm wondered sometimes if Elvis
Presley couldn't show up


271
0:11:23,69 --> 0:11:25,91
and draw five people
or something.


272
0:11:25,91 --> 0:11:27,12
It's just the people.


273
0:11:27,12 --> 0:11:31,81
It's not a really big scene
around here like it is in a


274
0:11:31,81 --> 0:11:32,63
larger city.

[MUSIC PLAYING]


276

DOC DAILEY: Everybody growing up
around here, their parents


277
0:11:41,14 --> 0:11:43,15
know some session guys.


278
0:11:43,15 --> 0:11:44,39
And everybody grew
up with guitar in


279
0:11:44,39 --> 0:11:45,742
their house and pianos.


280
0:11:45,742 --> 0:11:47,12
It's hard to find someone
down here that


281
0:11:47,12 --> 0:11:48,293
doesn't play a guitar.

[MUSIC PLAYING]


283
0:11:51,15 --> 0:11:53,85
IAN SVENONIUS: I think of the
Muscle Shoals thing as kind of


284
0:11:53,85 --> 0:11:56,365
this meeting point of
all these songs.


285
0:11:56,365 --> 0:11:57,5
DAVID HOOD: I think so, too.


286
0:11:57,5 --> 0:12:2,21
And I think it was the players,
and engineers, and


287
0:12:2,21 --> 0:12:4,56
people that created that
sound probably more


288
0:12:4,56 --> 0:12:5,6
than anything else.


289
0:12:5,6 --> 0:12:7,48
SCOTT BOYER: The heart and soul
that the people around


290
0:12:7,48 --> 0:12:11,362
here play with has always been
my favorite thing about music


291
0:12:11,362 --> 0:12:13,53
from the Shoals, you know.


292
0:12:13,53 --> 0:12:16,52
DONNIE FRITZ: How this can
happen in a little bitty town


293
0:12:16,52 --> 0:12:18,215
in North Alabama, you know.


294
0:12:18,215 --> 0:12:18,59
SCOTT BOYER: Yeah.


295
0:12:18,59 --> 0:12:20,82
I don't know whether to call it
magic or not, but there's


296
0:12:20,82 --> 0:12:23,45
been something going
on here that


297
0:12:23,45 --> 0:12:26,23
doesn't go on other places.


298
0:12:26,23 --> 0:12:29,97
RICK HALL: The main thing is,
it's all about music.


299
0:12:29,97 --> 0:12:31,47
And it all starts with a song.


300
0:12:31,47 --> 0:12:32,73
And we can't forget that.
