###4 bjbj< Brandon Schauer: When I think about John, I think about the William Gibson quote
###6 that s quite popular, which is, The future is already here. It s just not evenly distributed.
###11 John s a guy who goes and finds where it s unevenly distributed, too. Tells the story.
###20 Brings back empirical data about it, and tells us what matters about it. I think he s really
###26 important for this crowd because he s going to tell us about the way our work needs to
###31 change. Our work, anyone in an organization who really wants to be relevant and perform
###37 well. As you can see from the program, he has quite a distinguished background. He s
###42 held top positions, leading consultancies, such as McKinsey and Boston Consulting Group,
###49 and he s currently serving as a co-chair of the Silicon Valley-based Deloitte LP Center
###55 for the Edge, and he s doing a lot of original research to develop new points of view on
###62 corporate growth, but the latest of his books, which is down here cause I just had him sign
###69 it, co-authored with John Seely Brown and Lang Davison, is The Power of Pull from which
###74 he will be pulling some of his ideas for today. So I think it s critical for us to listen
###81 to him because he s going to tell us what needs to change about how we need to work.
###87 As mentors of your acts, you re already in a potentially powerful position as being someone
###91 who spends time with customers and spends a lot of time looking at the behaviors they
###97 have. There s an interesting stream of data that you cross and pull into your own organizations
###102 and see how the organization is actually doing work to serve these customers. These are two
###107 critical points of data, but I caution that if we don t spend time listening and paying
###115 attention to what John has to say, and the realizations he has about the nature of how
###121 our work should change, we could potentially be marginalized and really left behind those
###125 who are really performing well and better than us in the UX business. So please listen
###132 up, and I d love to invite John Hagel III to the stage. John Hagel III: Hi. It s great
###145 to be here this afternoon. I m particularly privileged to speak a group that s at the
###150 leading edge of experience design. It s somewhat intimidating, though, because I confess I
###157 come before you without any slides whatsoever or any visual aids whatsoever so I am the
###166 experience here. It s clear that I m not a designer. I m a simple business guy. I think
###174 I m what many of you refer to as the suits, and I don t think you re referring to the
###180 fine cut of our tailored suits when you use that term. ll just start by saying that I
###186 m in awe of what you ve accomplished over the past decade. Moving the design mentality
###194 mindset skill set from the design of products and services to the design of experiences
###201 of the users of those products and services helps to more effectively pull out the real
###208 potential value of the products and services they re dealing with, but as impressive as
###215 that is, I want to suggest that there s another wave of opportunity ahead, and that is to
###221 design experiences that help all of us to pull out the full potential of ourselves,
###229 and not just the products and services that we use. What if we could apply the tools and
###236 principles of experience design to help each of us to more effectively drive more rapid
###243 waves of learning and performance improvement by working together? I want to illustrate
###250 that opportunity by going back in time to the beginning of my career. As Brandon mentioned,
###255 I started a long time ago at Boston Consulting Group. Boston Consulting Group is a strategy
###262 consulting firm. They basically built their reputation on one chart, one visual aid, and
###270 it was called the Experience Curve. What the Experience Curve did was describe how performance
###276 improves, and it started by looking at the semiconductor industry, and looked at operating
###281 performance improvement in the semiconductor industry over many, many years, and it had
###287 a very distinctive pattern to it, and over the years BCG applied this analysis to industry
###293 after industry everything from Japanese beer to toilet paper. All of it follows the experience
###300 curve as a way of describing how performance improves in markets and industries. So it
###306 s a very accurate description of performance improvement, but it has one distinctive characteristic,
###313 which I think is important to highlight here, which is it s a diminishing returns curve.
###320 The more experience you accumulate in a marketer industry, the longer and harder you have to
###326 work to get the next increment of performance improvement. It may help to explain why many
###332 of us are feeling increasing stress in the markets and industries that we operate in.
###339 But what if there were an alternative? What if we could turn the experience curve on its
###345 side and generate increasing returns, rather than diminishing returns? What if performance
###355 improvement accelerated as the number of participants expands? Now that would be powerful, but what
###364 would it require? Well, I suggest it requires a lot of things, and it starts with a major
###371 shift in our beliefs and our practices. It s a key dimension of what we ve described
###378 in The Power of Pull as the big shift, and as a result, I think it requires a shift in
###384 design focus so let me amplify a bit on that, and when I talk about shift in beliefs, I
###391 m talking about a shift in our view of where and how economic value gets created. The shorthand
###400 way we have of capturing that is saying we re moving from a world of stocks to a world
###405 of flows. And what do I mean by that? Well, I m referring in this case not to stocks that
###411 are traded on the stock market, but knowledge stocks, what we know at any point in time,
###417 and it turns out if you ask any executive and really probe as to their basic beliefs
###421 of what s created economic value, the basic assumption is, first of all, you have to acquire
###427 some proprietary knowledge stocks, and then you have to, aggressively as possible, protect
###433 those knowledge stocks from anybody else getting access to them, and then as efficiently as
###438 possible, extract the value from those knowledge stocks. Huge corporations were created in
###445 the 20th Century around this set of beliefs. Enormous wealth generated around this set
###450 of beliefs. We make the case that, in fact, we re shifting from a world of knowledge stocks
###457 to a world of knowledge flows, and the reason for that is, if you think about it, anything
###461 you know today has more and more rapidly depreciating value. What we know today has a very limited
###471 shelf life. The shelf life is shrinking over time, and the only way you can create economic
###477 value in that kind of environment is to find ways to more effectively participate in a
###484 larger number of more diverse knowledge flows so that you can refresh those knowledge stocks
###490 at an accelerating rate. Fundamentally different view of what s required to create economic
###497 value. Now in this context I m actually very intrigued. I ve just recently encountered
###503 a set of design theories that are known as constructal design theories generated by two
###509 people: Adrian Bejan and Sylvie Laurent, and what they ve done is they ve built a design
###516 perspective based on what they call a constructal law that they ve observed now in playing out
###522 across physical environments, biological environments and social systems. And essentially what the
###530 constructal law says is that in order to survive, systems have to evolve greater and greater
###537 access to the currents that flow through them. Whether we re talking about riverbeds, trees,
###548 the design of our lungs or our cities, it turns out they all obey this constructal law.
###556 Systems that survive and thrive are those that evolve most rapidly and effectively to
###563 enhance those flows within those systems. So I think two interesting implications from
###570 this perspective: one is that the whole emphasis on system design is on enhancing flows. That
###578 really is the mark of a successful system and experience within the system, and it s
###583 also an emphasis on evolving systems, not static systems because the emphasis here is
###588 these systems are continually evolving, and if they re not they re in trouble, and they
###592 re continuing evolving along a certain pattern, which is how do you more effectively generate
###597 and support the flows within the system. So what would it mean to design the systems we
###605 live and work in to continually evolve our ability to experience more and more flow,
###611 especially the flow of people and of ideas? So that s one shift: the shift in beliefs
###623 from stocks to flows. There s a corollary to this, which is a shift in practices. If
###630 they were fundamentally changing in terms of where the source of economic value is,
###634 it stands to reason that the practices we use to create economic value are going to
###639 have to change in a significant way as well, and the way we capture this is the notion
###644 of moving from a world of push to a world of pull. Again, if you go back in time to
###652 the 20th Century, the large companies that succeeded in the 20th Century were operating
###658 on a push model. Basically said the key is to forecast and predict demand, and then make
###665 sure that all the right people and resources are in the right place at the right time to
###670 meet that demand. Again, huge multinational corporations created with this push model,
###676 enormous wealth created. On the other hand, if we re living in a more uncertain and more
###682 rapidly changing world, that kind of push model becomes more and more challenging, more
###688 and more problematic, and the questions is then, well, what s the replacement? What s
###693 the option? Well, we argue that it s all about pull practices. Now many of you, when I say
###699 pull, are going to have a certain mindset or image of what I mean by pull. I want to
###704 kind of expand that, hopefully. I think it probably expands by talking about three levels
###709 of pull that are becoming increasingly important. There s one level, which is probably the most
###715 obvious, which I call access. It s simply the notion of how do I more effectively access
###722 people and resources when I need them or where I need them? It s basic search functionality
###727 that Google offers. It s the shift from push-based media to pull-based media so you can pull
###733 the media you want, experience at any point in time wherever you want it. Now that s a
###739 powerful of pull, but it s just the first level. I haven t even begun to tap into the
###745 opportunity around pull, which comes starting with the second level, which is the notion
###750 of attraction. Here s the challenge: In a world that s more rapidly changing, you don
###756 t even know what to look for, what questions to ask, what to search for. The only way you
###764 re going to survive and thrive in that kind of world is by attracting people and resources
###770 to you that you never even knew existed, and we ve all had the experience of serendipity
###776 an unexpected encounter. You run into somebody. You start up a conversation. Start talking
###782 about some of the issues you re dealing with, and my God, they offer some insight that you
###785 d been struggling with for months. Enormously valuable opportunities. Now when I talk about
###794 serendipity, most people respond, Yeah, but that s pure luck. Now there s nothing you
###799 can do about serendipity. It just happens. All you can do is be prepared for it when
###803 it does happen. Well, in fact, we make a very strong case that you can shape serendipity.
###812 You can increase both the probability and the quality of those unexpected encounters
###819 by making choices about where you spend your time and how you spend your time. Significant
###826 potential to affect that serendipity, that ability to pull that second level of pull,
###835 but there s a third level that s even more interesting, and this is the one I focus on
###839 in the context of this discussion around design challenges and opportunities. The third level
###845 of pull is what I call achieve. It s the notion of pulling out of each of us, and out of the
###851 institutions we work in the full potential that resides within us and within those institutions.
###859 It gets to the notion of learning, more rapid learning, more rapid performance improvement
###865 by using those first two levels of pull and adding some additional elements on top. That
###871 s where the real power of pull comes in, is if you can tap into that in a world of increasing
###878 pressure, that s the opportunity to shift from diminishing returns to increasing returns.
###884 But the key question is how do you design systems and experiences that provide us with
###893 those scalable pull experiences? It s not just with a few friends or coworkers, but
###901 to really be successful we talk about the notion of scalable pull. How do you do this
###907 in a global basis where you can draw out people and resources, not just in your local workplace,
###916 but around the world, wherever they reside? Now I confess I don t have the answers to
###925 these questions that I m posing. I don t think anyone does at this point. That s partly why
###930 I think they re such interesting questions, but I m hoping to intrigue and tease enough
###935 of you that you ll start to come up with the answers to the questions, and I don t have
###945 the answers, but I think I can frame some of the questions that need to be answered,
###950 and in particular I want to focus on two dimensions of the design challenge: one having to do
###957 with platforms and the other having to do with pathways, and I think they re both important.
###964 In fact, one without the other becomes not very interesting. s what are the platform
###971 designs that would accelerate scalable peer-to-peer learning? How would you think about a scalable
###977 platform to do that? What are the design elements? And then how can we design the pathways that
###985 will help us get pragmatically from where we are today, which is nowhere near scalable
###990 pull platforms, to that big opportunity that s out there? So let me just spend a minute
###1000 on the notion of platform designs. What would platform designs have to do? We all know that
###1007 teams are incredibly rich environments for accelerated peer-to-peer learning. If you
###1014 re a part of a high-performing team, you re going to learn very rapidly and dramatically
###1021 improve your own performance in the process, but there s a big challenge with teams. Teams
###1029 don t scale. As soon as teams get to a certain size, they begin to disintegrate. They begin
###1036 to fall apart. So if you re looking for scalable pull in the sense of more rapid performance
###1043 improvement and learning, teams alone are not the answer. They re part of the solution,
###1048 but the question then becomes how do we embed teams in increasingly rich platforms that
###1057 scale by encouraging the formation of even more teams, and also connect with and learn
###1064 from each other across teams? That begins to look like a scalable pull platform. Now,
###1075 as Brandon mentioned, I look for early instances of some of these things in action, and so
###1082 I want to share a couple of examples of the opportunity that s playing out in some domains
###1088 that are not very central to business, but I think the opportunity is to learn from those
###1094 environments and apply design principles into business. So one example of where some of
###1102 this scalable pull platform is emerging is online in a video game that most of you, many
###1109 of you at least, may be familiar with called World of Warcraft. It has 12 million participants
###1115 on a global scale 12 million and it s rapidly growing, continuing to grow. Most of those
###1123 12 million participants are organized into high-performing teams. If they re richly connected
###1130 across teams, they call them Gills. Through rich networks of discussion forums, video
###1137 repositories, all kinds of resources that can help the members of these teams learn,
###1142 not just within the team, but across teams, very interesting network layered on top of
###1149 teams to make them even more successful. There s another example that we ve spent a fair
###1156 amount of time with and we talk about in the book, which is extreme sports. In particular
###1163 we ve spent a lot of time looking at big wave surfing as an area of extreme performance
###1168 improvement, and it turns out big wave surfers, by definition, are very much tied to local
###1175 physical environments. They re not on the Internet playing games. They re on surf breaks
###1181 wrestling with very, very challenging waves as they come. So they re deeply grounded in
###1186 their physical environment, but the scalability of the learning comes from the opportunity
###1191 to layer on top of that physical experience participation in virtual environments, and
###1198 again, learning from each other regardless of where these surfers are located. South
###1203 African surfers communicating with Australian surfers communicating with Hawaiian surfers,
###1210 all of them using the same kinds of facilities discussion forums, video repositories. They
###1215 study videos of each other to learn the practices that are emerging in different local areas,
###1221 and the social relationships that have emerged around those exchanges of information. So
###1230 those are a couple of interesting examples of the kinds of platforms that are emerging
###1236 that create scalable pull in the sense of learning opportunities, more rapid learning,
###1241 more rapid performance improvement as more participants join in. Really interesting opportunity
###1248 in a business context. I mentioned there was a second design challenge, though, which is
###1255 not just the platforms. It has to do with the pathways. Anybody who starts talking about
###1260 these kinds of scalable pull platforms in front of an executive is going to get a bleary
###1264 look on the face and say, Well, wait a minute. I m over here. You re talking about something
###1270 that s way out there. How they hell am I going to get out there? So if you don t design a
###1275 pathway that helps people to move in a pragmatic way from where they are today to where they
###1281 need to be, it s going to be a very short conversation. So in that context I want to
###1289 tell a bit of a story around a company that we found very interesting in the context of
###1294 pull. It s a company I think most of you are probably familiar with. It s in the software
###1301 business and it s called SAP. SAP was at one time a highly entrepreneurial company. The
###1309 founder of it, Hasso Plattner, amazing guy, very curmudgeonly guy, very passionate about
###1316 the software technology and work that he did. He became more and more concerned as his company
###1323 grew and scaled because, as it grew and scaled, it started to take on more and more of the
###1328 kind of bureaucratic tradition-bound risk averse, not invented here kinds of cultures
###1336 that many of us are familiar with in large companies. So he said, ve got to change this.
###1344 And what he did was he went out and he bought a company, and he bought the company not particularly
###1351 because the company was great, but because he wanted the guy who was the founder of that
###1355 company. It was a guy by the name of Shai Agassi. Not many of you may be familiar with
###1361 Shai. He made Shai a very senior executive of SAP, but he said, m not going to put you
###1368 in charge of the core part of my business because if I do they re going to kill you
###1372 over there, and you re a really nice guy. I don t want to see you killed. So what I
###1379 m going to do is I m going to put you in charge of a part of the business that s on the edge.
###1384 It s a new product that we re introducing called NetWeaver. It s generating a very limited
###1389 amount of revenue and no profit so nobody is going to pay attention to it over in the
###1396 core of the business. You ll have degrees of freedom out there that you wouldn t have
###1400 if you were in the core, and he said, I want you to use that platform as an opportunity
###1405 to redefine how we work together and how we can get to more accelerated performance improvement.
###1412 What Shai did was he created a platform called the SAP Developer Network, and initially it
###1422 was a very simple platform. It basically was an environment you could come into, an online
###1426 environment, where if you were a developer working on this NetWeaver product and running
###1432 into programming issues, as many people would, you could pose the question and see if anybody
###1439 else had had an experience that was equivalent could help you work your way through the problem
###1444 you were wrestling with. Really simple. Basically a discussion forum, but incredibly powerful.
###1454 And it turns out now SAP Developer Network has about two million software developers
###1461 actively participating on this network, and again, it s growing at a very rapid rate.
###1467 It s scaling. And it has generated enormous productivity on the part of these software
###1476 developers, and the initial focus of the platform was actually software developers outside of
###1482 SAP. It was software developers in third-party channels, software developers in the customers,
###1488 not the SAP developers because the SAP developers had this mindset that how can you possibly
###1494 learn from anybody outside our company. You know, we re an incredibly successful company.
###1499 Well, it turns out over time more and more of the SAP developers have migrated out into
###1505 this developer network because word has spread that it s an amazing productivity tool. You
###1511 can develop more rapidly, learn more quickly as part of this network than you ever could
###1516 working on your own or working as part of your local team. So very interesting progression
###1525 over time. I tell the story because I think it illustrates a number of elements of pathways
###1532 that are going to be important to realizing this opportunity to create scalable pull platforms.
###1540 One of the pathways is the notion of starting with a very simple transaction in these environments.
###1548 There s often a temptation to go out with very elaborate kind of learning environments
###1554 and performance improvement environments. This was a simple question and answer discussion
###1560 forum: Pose the problem. See if anybody else has an answer to it, and then move to using
###1568 that to build reputation and relationships. What happened was that as people started answering
###1575 the problems, they developed a reputation. They actually got points. SAP awarded them
###1582 points for each successful answer that was delivered, and they built a reputation around
###1588 those points. Interesting sidelight, it turns out that a lot of software recruiters had
###1594 figured out that if you re looking for a software developer with real talent in certain areas,
###1600 go into the SAP Developer Network and look at those reputation profiles, and you ll find
###1605 people who are really successful at answering some really challenging problems. So it turns
###1611 out even though those people offering answers were not getting any monetary reward directly
###1616 for their answers, they were getting some more and more attractive job offers as a result
###1621 of having done that. More motivation to contribute even more. And by the way, I should say at
###1628 this point the average time to answer a problem that s provided on the SAP Developer Network
###1634 is about 17 minutes from the time it s posed to the time the problem is resolved 17 minutes.
###1642 So it s a very, very successful platform in that regard. But what s happened is then you
###1647 ve got a third level of progression and evolution, which is the notion that over time, as a result
###1654 of this reputation and the relationships that emerge, because people were seeking each other
###1659 out as they saw each other s reputation in certain areas, teams stated to form and took
###1665 on more and more challenging application development initiatives, not just solving a problem with
###1671 their current coding efforts, but actually came together from around the world to develop
###1678 entirely new applications, again, based on the reputation and relationships that they
###1683 had built as part of this environment. So it s an interesting progression. It says start
###1691 with very simple kinds of transactions and build on that over time so you get these relationships
###1697 emerging and more interesting learning environments begin to surface over time. There s a second
###1705 dimension to the pathway, which is that the model that Shai used here, as an entrepreneur
###1711 in the software industry, he was a big proponent of rapid iteration of software development,
###1718 and so the notion of deploying this network in very short increments, getting it out there,
###1724 watching how people behaved on these networks and what kinds of things were working, what
###1729 wasn t, and then doing another iteration based on that was a very powerful way to learn from
###1737 the participants and not simply spend a ton of money upfront trying to figure out what
###1742 they would need. So that s a second dimension. A third dimension is this notion of starting
###1749 on the edge. You know, there s a big question of how do you get change to happen. If we
###1756 re talking about scalable pull platforms with large enterprises, that s really hard to accomplish
###1762 given the deeply held beliefs and practices that drive the core. Most of the cores of
###1768 our companies are push-based cores, and so the notion of not trying to change the core,
###1776 but going out to an interesting edge and driving change from the edge, and by the way, not
###1782 bringing that edge back into the core. So they would have killed the developer network
###1788 if they tried to bring it back into the core. What they were doing was creating more and
###1793 more incentive and motivation to pull more and more of the people in the core and resources
###1800 in the core out to the edge and scale the edge even more rapidly around a very different
###1806 set of practices than had prevailed within SAP at the time. There s another dimension
###1814 of the pathway which I think becomes extremely important to drive the movement, and that
###1822 s the notion of performance metrics to measure progress, and I think what s particularly
###1828 interesting about this opportunity for more rapid performance improvement is it almost
###1832 by definition suggests a set of metrics to say how are we doing. Is performance actually
###1839 improving as a result of participation on these platforms? And what can we learn from
###1846 either the fact that it s improving very, very rapidly or not improving as much as we
###1850 d like? How would we tweak it so that we can actually get more rapid performance improvement?
###1856 So it involves really focusing on what are people trying to get better at in these environments?
###1862 What is the performance improvement goal or objective? And how would you measure progress
###1868 in the performance improvement? So at this point it s not just the learning. You can
###1872 t measure learning directly, but you can measure the outcome from the learning, which ought
###1877 to be performance improvement in whatever domain. SAP was relentless in measuring this
###1885 notion of time from question posed to answer received as a measure of performance improvement
###1892 within this network. And then, finally, there s a fifth dimension of the pathway, which
###1902 is building passion, and I think if anybody is trying to design an environment and set
###1910 of experiences to drive more rapid performance improvement and more rapid learning, you ultimately
###1917 need to focus on how do you build, generate, catalyze, nurture passion among the participants.
###1929 The key participants in the SAP Developer Network are deeply passionate about the work
###1935 they re doing on that network. They re not doing this just because there s monetary opportunity.
###1942 They are intrinsically engaged in what they re doing, and having an impact with what they
###1947 re doing and having an impact with a broader and broader range of people with what they
###1952 re doing. There is real passion. So if we get it right I think there s really significant
###1962 opportunity, but I don t want to just position this as an opportunity. I m going to suggest
###1969 that the reason I m optimistic this challenge is going to be addressed is because it s an
###1976 imperative. It s not just an opportunity. We re going to have to do this. It s not a
###1980 choice. It s not something that s nice to have if we have some budget left over. It
###1986 s essential to succeed in an increasingly competitive business world. Why do I say that?
###1994 Well, one of the things that we talk about in our research for The Power of Pull is we
###2003 asked a fairly simple question, which we thought had been certainly asked and probably answered,
###2010 which was just a question of how are we doing as companies. How are companies doing? Not
###2017 just in the most recent quarter or the past year, but over a long period of time. How
###2023 are companies doing? To our surprise, perhaps not so much shouldn t have been a surprise
###2031 given the very short-term focus we increasingly all have, that question, to our knowledge,
###2036 had never been asked, much less answered. So what we ended up doing was looking at all
###2043 public companies in the United States, not just a sample, but every single public company,
###2050 and we looked at it over a long period of time. We went back to 1965 to today, and we
###2057 asked the question, how are they doing? Now to measure performance, and this may be a
###2062 bit controversial, and we can certainly talk about the pros and cons, we ended up focusing
###2067 on return on assets as our measure of performance. It turns out if you look at return on assets
###2076 for all public companies in the U.S. since 1965 to today return on assets has collapsed.
###2083 It s collapsed by 75 percent over that time period. It s a sustained erosion. There is
###2093 no sign of it leveling off. There s absolutely no sign of it turning around. So I think it
###2103 suggests that the management practices and the management institutions we have today
###2108 are fundamentally broken, and if we don t crack this opportunity around more rapid performance
###2115 improvement and more rapid learning, these companies are going to go out of business.
###2119 And when I go into corporate boardrooms these days, I m struck by how often, how frequently
###2126 I hear the metaphor or the image of the Red Queen from Alice in Wonderland. You know,
###2133 executives talk about feeling the Red Queen Effect. And I actually push back on that and
###2141 I make the case that the Red Queen actually had it pretty good. The Red Queen ran faster
###2148 and faster and she stayed in the same place. We re running faster and faster and falling
###2155 farther and farther behind so I think the Red Queen actually had it much better than
###2161 we do. So I don t think we have a choice about this. I think this is becoming more and more
###2169 of an imperative. If we don t figure out how to learn faster and how to accelerate performance
###2174 improvement, and how to go from that diminishing returns environment to an increasing returns
###2178 environment we re going out of business. Return on assets, by the way, if you just follow
###2186 the current trend line, which, again, has been playing out for 40-plus years, reaches
###2191 zero somewhere around 2022 so that s not a sustainable outcome. Something will change
###2201 over this next decade in order to address that. So I want to end just by focusing on
###2212 the opportunity. Again, I don t want to end on a negative note. I come from Silicon Valley.
###2218 We re inherent optimists. I mentioned earlier that the opportunity here was this notion
###2225 of increasing returns; that you get better faster as more and more participants join
###2230 in, and that s a real exciting and powerful opportunity, but I think that s just the tip
###2234 of the iceberg. The one thing that strikes me when I hear discussions of increasing return
###2241 is the classic example that people use to illustrate increasing returns, is the fax
###2247 machine, and that s the notion if you have one fax machine it actually has negative value.
###2252 You had to pay money to get it and you can t do anything with it so it s actually a negative
###2257 value. As more fax machines get added in and connect to each other, the value goes up over
###2265 time exponentially for all those fax machines. But there s a really interesting element or
###2272 detail in that story or in that example, and that is that as fax machines increase in numbers
###2279 they are not changing in terms of their basic performance. It s simply a function of adding
###2284 and connecting more fax machines together, and that is a powerful form of increasing
###2290 returns, but there s a second forum, which is what if each of those fax machines were
###2296 getting better in terms of their performance and functionality, their design, by participating
###2303 in this broader network. Then you get a second increasing returns curve higher, steeper than
###2310 the previous one. So it s a very significant opportunity. I think that those of you who
###2318 can take on this design challenge and can crack the really difficult problems, I don
###2324 t want to in any way trivialize the challenges to creating these pull platforms are going
###2330 to be on the edge of a whole new way of design activity and practices. But one final thought
###2340 just to kind of put this into an even broader context is that rather than focusing on sustainability
###2347 as a world, I think we should be taking on an even greater challenge. It s something
###2352 that a friend of mine, Jean Russell, calls thrivability rather than sustainability. Sustainability
###2358 has a notion of sustaining what we have. Thrivability has a notion of how do we generate more and
###2366 more sustainable prosperity from the limited natural resources that our planet has been
###2373 endowed with. So I don t think it s just our business that depends on learning faster by
###2380 working together, but it s our planet. It s our entire world. If we don t figure out
###2388 how to drive that kind of more rapid learning and performance improvement, we re increasingly
###2394 challenged as a planet. We either have to be satisfied with less and less or we have
###2399 to face the consequences of depleting resources that are not replaceable. So I think we need
###2409 to design these new experiences for all of us, not just for the companies that we re
###2417 in today. Thank you very much. Brandon Schauer: So John has a little bit of time for some
###2430 Q&A, and I want to kind of kick it off. I think one of the challenges for this group
###2436 is that we re poised between what we hear from customers, what we see from customers.
###2443 They being somewhat our platform for learning, as well as the organization, and the organization
###2450 representing much more of the core that we re struggling with day in, day out. I think
###2458 I can see examples from our industry where one organization is moving ahead of another
###2465 because of their ability to create a learning platform with customers, as well as within
###2471 the organization. I heard a talk about a year ago by one of the creative directors at Electronic
###2478 Arts. His story was of how they originally started Madden football franchise interface
###2485 based on what TV looks like, but then they tested it with customers and found out people
###2492 don t really like the way the television is illustrating the experience of football for
###2497 people. The scores were too big; they took up too much of the screen. You couldn t really
###2501 see the action, and so by passionately testing and improving this interface, they were actually
###2507 starting to see that football was following the way Electronic Arts was presenting football
###2514 through gaming because TV doesn t inter-test necessarily or they don t do it in the same
###2522 way. So we can see how one organization starts to build another or beat out another if this
###2526 case is TV versus gaming, but I guess my question is, what have you found seem to be the linchpin
###2536 ideas or changes that an organization can take on to start moving towards this platform?
###2541 One of them was going to the edge. Are there others that we, as people who often are kind
###2547 of the middle of the organization, trying to push things forward? Are there other tactics
###2553 we can start to employ? John Hagel III: Well, it s a great question. I think that there
###2559 are many different approaches, and they hinge on the particular environments. I would say
###2563 that one of the reasons I m optimistic is I do think many companies, if not all, have
###2569 kind of made this transition from a very narrow product-centric view of their offers to much
###2578 more of a sense that those products, if they re going to be successful, have to be situated
###2583 within a context in the customer, and that you have to really kind of cross the table
###2588 and understand what is the customer actually trying to do with these products and services.
###2592 What are they trying to accomplish with them? And so broadening your horizon to look at
###2599 the context, and I would say that if you ve gone that far there s, I think, a logical
###2605 next step, which is for most situations customers are trying to use these products to get better
###2615 at something else, something broader that they re trying to do. What is that something
###2620 better and how can you create design experiences? And I think one of things, at least from my
###2628 experience, is particularly important in this context, and there is a barrier for many companies
###2635 to address this, but too often companies think about the user experiences, the mantra of
###2645 one-to-one relationships, and increasingly I think if you re really committed to helping
###2652 customers get better faster using the products and services that have been provided to them,
###2661 and I hasten to add it s not just getting better at using the product. It s getting
###2666 better at whatever task or work they re trying to do where this product fits into that experience.
###2675 If you re really committed to doing that, you re going to need to bring in other people,
###2680 other participants, at least other customers, and potentially other companies to be more
###2688 helpful to those customers so that they can get better faster using those products or
###2694 services. So, again, I think one of the hooks here is this notion of there s been a trajectory
###2701 of progression. Understanding customer experiences is broader than just the direct interaction
###2708 with the product, and then taking it to that next step of saying what if, and I think often
###2714 I find the what if exercise is a pretty interesting one to really put in tangible terms what would
###2721 the opportunity be? What if the customers could take our products and services and get
###2727 better faster on a particular dimension? How would that drive their continued purchase
###2733 of our own products or the pace of adoption of our products? And, by the way, that was
###2739 one of the key metrics SAP used to measure the progression here, was rate of customer
###2745 adoption. As they deployed this developer network, one of their key objectives, clearly,
###2751 was to get more of the NetWeaver product into the enterprise, and so that was a key measure
###2756 and it was something that spoke to the very traditional core executive if you could communicate
###2763 in tangible terms that the pace of adoption was going up, and show how the kind of interactions
###2770 that were occurring on this developer network most likely contributed to that, you got the
###2775 attention of the core. That s something they can relate to versus learning and relationships
###2782 and these more qualitative kinds of terms. Brandon Schauer: One last thing before I turn
###2789 it on to the audience, why will push not work in the new environment you see? John Hagel
###2795 III: s not to say it won t ever work. I think at the end of the day if you really pushed
###2800 me on it I would say that everything we do is some blend of push and pull technique so
###2808 it s not to say push will completely disappear, but I do think that in a world that is increasingly
###2815 uncertain, and it s not just uncertain in small ways. Many of you are familiar with
###2821 Taleb s Black Swan concept. I think one of the interesting consequences of a more connected
###2827 world and a more competitive world, connection and competition together actually produce
###2833 some very interesting results. One of them is extreme events, cascades that go out of
###2838 control and go in ways we never would have expected. Who would have expected Egypt, Tunisia
###2848 would be but that s becoming more and more frequent. So it s not just the small unexpected,
###2856 We missed our forecast by 20 percent this quarter. It s these eruptions, and if you
###2861 have those kinds of eruptions, and you don t have access to pull platforms where you
###2865 can quickly adapt to those environments and hopefully prosper in them, you re going to
###2873 be increasingly challenged so I think that s a key reason. Brandon Schauer: All right.
###2878 Question from the audience? Audience Member:: You gave a framework access attraction achieve,
###2884 and I was a little bit vague about that, and then you gave the example of the developer
###2903 network, but it resonated with me and I understood it, and I wonder if you could just connect
###2906 that framework to that example so that I can get those pieces. John Hagel III: Great question.
###2911 So access is simply one of the things they had as part of the software developer network
###2916 was a lot of kind of frequently asked questions repositories. So you could access, you had
###2924 a problem, you could go search through the frequently asked questions and often get an
###2929 answer to your question. Second level of attract is much more this question of, as these reputations
###2939 were being built on this network, people were seeking out others in the network because
###2948 of that reputation, and the person being approached had no idea that these other people existed,
###2956 much less that they had interests that were kind of related to theirs and they started
###2960 getting into really interesting discussions and building relationships around that. So
###2965 that was attraction. You re attracting people that you never even knew existed as a result
###2970 of the reputations that were being built and the problem solving that you were doing for
###2974 others. And then the third level is the notion of achieve, pulling out our full potential,
###2981 learning faster. I think what s happened over time is this environment has become an extraordinarily
###2987 rich learning environment. I mean the productivity of the software developers has shot way up.
###2992 That s the motivation for more and more of these developers to join this network is because
###2997 they know that anytime they run into a problem they re going to get an answer pretty quickly,
###3003 and they ll just be able to learn not only from the answer, but move faster in terms
###3008 of their coding and learn faster as a result of that. They re learning faster because they
###3012 re connecting with each other and engaging in really interesting discussions around broader
###3017 software development issues, and they re learning faster because they re coming together in
###3021 teams and actually working together to develop new software now in ways they never would
###3025 ve done in the past. So hopefully that helps to clarify it a bit. Brandon Schauer: I think
###3035 I saw another hand. Could you step by the mic over here? Audience Member: So great talk.
###3037 John Hagel III: Thank you. Audience Member: And I have two questions: one is on a really
###3039 small scale. I m curious about where you see anonymity fitting into the pull model, and
###3053 then the second question is do you have any predictions and/or hopes for what you talked
###3061 about? John Hagel III: A lot of hopes. I have very few predictions. Who is it that said,
###3072 s very hard to predict the future, especially if it s in the future, or something like that?
###3077 In any event, I think that your first question was around anonymity, and I ve been involved
###3085 in the online environment for a long time. I actually wrote a book 15 years ago now I
###3091 think on virtual community; it s called Net Gain, and over that time period this whole
###3097 question of anonymity versus identity has really been a continuing discussion. I come
###3104 from the camp that both are going to be appropriate and relevant at different points in time.
###3110 I do believe that over time there s more and more value in persistent identity, being able
###3121 to what s the right word? Being able to build a reputation that is sustainable. Now you
###3131 could do that with persistent anonymous identity, an avatar, a made-up name. On the other hand
###3143 I also am a strong believer that at the end of the day the people who are going to learn
###3148 fastest and improve performance most rapidly are going to be those who find ways to connect
###3154 with each other, not just in virtual environments, but in physical environments, and it s going
###3160 to be very hard to preserve anonymity if you really believe you re going to end up having
###3165 to actually engage in a physical space with these people. I mean you could do it. I m
###3169 not going to say it s impossible, but I do think that that s more and more of an opportunity.
###3178 So no predictions. My hopes, you know, obviously I do think if we are able to harness this
###3187 design challenge and create these environments and experiences where people can learn faster,
###3193 I think it has many different effects. I mean I haven t had a chance to really talk about,
###3198 for example, what s going on in Africa and places like India using these kinds of environments
###3204 where these very remote villagers are learning from each other across villages and into the
###3209 cities in ways that would have never been possible before. I was at TED last week, and
###3219 one of the speakers gave an incredible discussion of what s going on in the favelas in Brazil
###3226 in terms of connectivity, and actually there s higher connectivity now in the favelas than
###3231 there is in the more affluent parts of Brazil, and it s precisely because these people recognize
###3237 that by coming together and connecting they re going to learn faster, and a huge motivation
###3242 to do that. So I m very hopeful that it will both broaden the access and prosperity that
###3249 we ve achieved in certain parts of the globe, and that ultimately it will help us to not
###3255 just respond to the increasing pressure and stress that we re all feeling, but actually
###3261 help us to thrive and get to new levels of rich experiences. So I m very hopeful at the
###3273 end of the day. Audience Member: Thanks for the great talk. Most of your examples are
###3281 focused kind of within the organization. I m wondering kind of within the enterprise
###3285 or kind of businesses connecting, perhaps, to one another, how you see pull working between
###3291 businesses and their customers and how that relationship has changed. John Hagel III:
###3298 Actually, the primary example I gave, SAP, was actually with customers and with third-party
###3304 channels. That was the primary focus of the SAP developer platform. It wasn t an internal
###3311 platform, and I actually believe, going back to the question of how do you get change to
###3315 happen in large companies, it s easier to change at the interface with the customer
###3321 than internally. We have such rigid policies, procedures, processes within the company,
###3330 and customers, fortunately or unfortunately, don t like rigid policies, procedures and
###3337 processes so if we re going to be successful in engaging with them and building deeper
###3342 trust-based relationships with them, we re going to have to figure this out, and so I
###3347 believe it s going to get figured out first at the customer interface and then be brought
###3353 into other parts of the company, but that is where the change will occur. And again,
###3360 part of it is just the incredibly increasing competitive pressure we re all facing in terms
###3365 of how do we expand our relationships with our customers and generate more revenue and
###3372 profitability from them, and that that s the economic driver that s going to make this
###3382 work. Audience Member: So kind of going back to the example that you were using at SAP,
###3389 you talked about the access kind of being the initial sort of core, and then as people
###3399 participated and these reputations and so forth, that it snowballed. So I have kind
###3404 of two questions around that: one is what kind of greases that wheel because conceptually
###3410 it s easy to get your arms around, but until you have the reputation how do you get the
###3414 people to come? Was there an actually promotion around that? Like how did they get that going?
###3421 And the second is, in our litigious society and how historically law has really been behind
###3427 technology, how do we navigate that with liability. We re in the healthcare industry and so there
###3435 are a whole lot of issues around sharing and learning and that kind of stuff. So I m interested
###3441 in your thoughts on that. John Hagel III: Yes. It s a great question. I think that in
###3447 terms of how it gets going, again, it s hard to generalize. In the SAP example it was this
###3453 simple process of they took some very narrowly-defined areas of the NetWeaver platform and created
###3461 some discussion forums where people could just come and ask a question, and so that
###3466 was the starting point. One of the issues you face with these kinds of platforms is
###3471 the empty room problem. Right? You create this discussion forum and you go in and ask
###3476 a question. It s an echo chamber. Nobody there to answer, to talk with you about it. So you
###3482 got to be thoughtful, first of all, about how you populate these arenas initially, potentially,
###3489 with some people within the company, but some lead customers who you ve identified or engaged
###3495 with in other contexts; draw them in so that they become part of the resource that can
###3501 be drawn upon. And I just want to broaden it a bit in the sense that I can t resist
###3510 telling a story but one of the people we profiled in the book, The Power of Pull, is a guy by
###3516 the name of Yossi Vardi. Some of you may know he s a very successful Israeli entrepreneur.
###3524 He goes to conferences. I d say six days out of seven he s at a conference somewhere in
###3532 the world. It s all over the world, but what s really interesting about him is he never
###3537 goes into a conference, into a session. He pays the money; he s there, but he never goes
###3543 into the session. He finds a sofa outside the room and he just sits there, and as he
###3550 sees interesting people wondering through the hall he kind of calls them over and says,
###3557 Who are you? Let s talk, and he strikes up these conversations, and he s a master of
###3563 serendipity. s choices like that, I mean, in terms of design that you, in fact, put
###3568 sofas out there, seats out there where people can connect with each other and start talking,
###3574 start conversations. It s really basic things like that. I just want to finish with a brief
###3580 story because it s such a great one on so many levels. It s actually a guy here in San
###3586 Francisco, who many of you I m sure know, Chris Anderson, who s the editor of Wired
###3592 magazine. On the side Chris has a startup in, of all things, drone aircraft technology,
###3599 unmanned aircraft. It s been his passion all his life, and he decided he was going to set
###3604 up this company, and as he set it up he got more and more anxious because he has absolutely
###3609 no technology background himself, and so he said, How can I do this startup without any
###3615 technologists? So he went out and back to the levels of pull he started with the first
###3621 level. He went on a very systematic search. He went out to all the logical suspects Carnegie
###3626 Mellon, MIT, Berkeley, Stanford, Caltech. Searched ruthlessly through all the PhD programs
###3636 to see if he could find anybody who had the profile of skills and experience that he was
###3641 looking for. Nobody. Nothing came up. He was really frustrated. One day he was in a discussion
###3647 forum online discussing drone aircraft technology, and he struck up a conversation with somebody
###3654 he had never encountered before, and the more he got into the conversation, the more excited
###3659 he became. He said, This guy knows more about drone aircraft technology than anybody I ve
###3664 ever met, and he finally asked the question. He said, Where did you get your PhD from?
###3670 And there was kind of this awkward silence on the other end of the discussion forum.
###3675 The guy evaded the question, and they went on in the conversation and the more they talked
###3681 the more excited Christ became, and he ultimately got enough trust with the guy to probe and
###3686 find out who and where he was. It turns out he was at the time a 19-year-old high-school
###3694 graduate in Tijuana, Mexico. Who would have thought to look among high-school graduates
###3704 in Tijuana, Mexico to find the CTO of your tech startup? This guy, now 23, is the CTO
###3713 of Chris startup; has moved to the United States. But I think it s a great example of
###3719 serendipity in action. You often don t know where to look for the people who are going
###3722 to be most valuable to you, and if you don t participate in environments that help you
###3727 to have those unexpected encounters, you re going to be increasingly challenged. Thank
###3729 you. [End of Audio] [Vimeo-210831897] Keynote_John Hagel III_MX 2011 Page PAGE of NUMPAGES www.verbalink.com
