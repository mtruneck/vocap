1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:4,28



2
0:0:4,28 --> 0:0:6,49
MALE SPEAKER: So it's
my great pleasure


3
0:0:6,49 --> 0:0:9,22
to introduce Bob
Frankston, who imagined


4
0:0:9,22 --> 0:0:13,86
a world with a spreadsheet
before computers really


5
0:0:13,86 --> 0:0:15,75
had a useful thing to do.


6
0:0:15,75 --> 0:0:19,33
And so it was world
changing, and I


7
0:0:19,33 --> 0:0:23,14
think what's really
interesting is when


8
0:0:23,14 --> 0:0:25,54
I met with Bob a couple weeks
ago and we start talking,


9
0:0:25,54 --> 0:0:28,63
we immediately got into
a really strong agreement


10
0:0:28,63 --> 0:0:31,18
and a really good argument
all within about four minutes.


11
0:0:31,18 --> 0:0:32,299
And so I thought,
that's the kind of guy


12
0:0:32,299 --> 0:0:33,132
I want to talk here.


13
0:0:33,132 --> 0:0:35,2
So thanks for coming, Bob.


14
0:0:35,2 --> 0:0:36,15
I really appreciate it.


15
0:0:36,15 --> 0:0:36,9
BOB FRANKSTON: OK.


16
0:0:36,9 --> 0:0:40,97



17
0:0:40,97 --> 0:0:42,57
As some people here
know, my history


18
0:0:42,57 --> 0:0:45,455
goes back well before VisiCalc,
which is actually Dan's idea.


19
0:0:45,455 --> 0:0:48,72



20
0:0:48,72 --> 0:0:53,431
I will go through history,
but let's start the talk.


21
0:0:53,431 --> 0:0:54,18
Hit the space bar.


22
0:0:54,18 --> 0:0:56,0
That's a good way
to move forward.


23
0:0:56,0 --> 0:0:58,1
So I'm going to start
at the end point.


24
0:0:58,1 --> 0:1:2,34
Both of the talk, where
the high-level issues are,


25
0:1:2,34 --> 0:1:4,76
and the sense that I
interested in the endpoints


26
0:1:4,76 --> 0:1:8,8
of connections, and not all
the network crap in the middle.


27
0:1:8,8 --> 0:1:10,22
So the internet itself
is just a technique.


28
0:1:10,22 --> 0:1:13,97
It's the way we can use whatever
is available to communicate.


29
0:1:13,97 --> 0:1:16,69
The problem is that we
have all these people who


30
0:1:16,69 --> 0:1:18,1
think the internet is important.


31
0:1:18,1 --> 0:1:21,64
That's thinking that there is
a thing called the internet.


32
0:1:21,64 --> 0:1:25,16
And they sort of have to
defend it and make it work.


33
0:1:25,16 --> 0:1:28,35
And for me, it's just
that stuff in the middle.


34
0:1:28,35 --> 0:1:30,55
I just start with
what you do with it.


35
0:1:30,55 --> 0:1:33,34
And you mentioned using
VisiCalc, some people at the St


36
0:1:33,34 --> 0:1:35,3
Student Information
Processing Board


37
0:1:35,3 --> 0:1:38,64
at MIT, which I
co-founded in '69, trying


38
0:1:38,64 --> 0:1:40,72
to get people to use
computers back then.


39
0:1:40,72 --> 0:1:42,7
I had a sense they were useful.


40
0:1:42,7 --> 0:1:44,81
Nobody believed me.


41
0:1:44,81 --> 0:1:48,38
And this is that actually
the culture, the Project MAC,


42
0:1:48,38 --> 0:1:50,99
which is in the building that's
inside one of the Novartis


43
0:1:50,99 --> 0:1:55,644
buildings now, which
is the attitude of how


44
0:1:55,644 --> 0:1:57,6
do we make this
technology useful?


45
0:1:57,6 --> 0:1:59,44
What can we do with it?


46
0:1:59,44 --> 0:2:2,29
So I'm skipping outside my
talk, but for me the slides


47
0:2:2,29 --> 0:2:3,56
are mainly a guide.


48
0:2:3,56 --> 0:2:7,16
They try to keep me on track.


49
0:2:7,16 --> 0:2:9,41
There will be lots of points
we can discuss later I'll


50
0:2:9,41 --> 0:2:10,43
just mention.


51
0:2:10,43 --> 0:2:14,0
One of the big insights is
the least important thing


52
0:2:14,0 --> 0:2:17,4
we do is exchange content.


53
0:2:17,4 --> 0:2:20,29
Now that might sound
heretical, but how many people


54
0:2:20,29 --> 0:2:23,12
have ever sent a
copy of Wikipedia?


55
0:2:23,12 --> 0:2:25,1
You just say the word Wikipedia.


56
0:2:25,1 --> 0:2:25,72
You refer to it.


57
0:2:25,72 --> 0:2:27,89
You never send it.


58
0:2:27,89 --> 0:2:31,1
And that's part of the secret
about what makes this work.


59
0:2:31,1 --> 0:2:33,17
Yet all our policies,
all our measures


60
0:2:33,17 --> 0:2:36,77
of broadband and everything,
running out of internet,


61
0:2:36,77 --> 0:2:40,79
are based on the idea we're
shipping exabytes of data


62
0:2:40,79 --> 0:2:42,305
through this one
router, which must


63
0:2:42,305 --> 0:2:43,638
be in the middle of Kansas City.


64
0:2:43,638 --> 0:2:46,772



65
0:2:46,772 --> 0:2:48,98
But for me, the internet is
really about opportunity.


66
0:2:48,98 --> 0:2:52,4
How do we create opportunity
to do things at the-- well,


67
0:2:52,4 --> 0:2:55,57
there's no real edge,
but outside of the net?


68
0:2:55,57 --> 0:2:58,61



69
0:2:58,61 --> 0:3:1,11
And the other important
point is that the internet


70
0:3:1,11 --> 0:3:3,0
is a discontinuity.


71
0:3:3,0 --> 0:3:8,26
When you read the classic
histories of in the internet,


72
0:3:8,26 --> 0:3:10,73
they start with the ARPANET
and have a packet radio.


73
0:3:10,73 --> 0:3:12,57
No, that's nonsense.


74
0:3:12,57 --> 0:3:16,2
Yes, the excellent
technologies were there,


75
0:3:16,2 --> 0:3:19,24
but the interent really
started from a very different


76
0:3:19,24 --> 0:3:20,45
beginning.


77
0:3:20,45 --> 0:3:25,67
It was the revolt against
networking as a service.


78
0:3:25,67 --> 0:3:27,85
You didn't need a third
party along the way


79
0:3:27,85 --> 0:3:29,64
to read your telegram
like a scribe


80
0:3:29,64 --> 0:3:32,46
and repeat it down the line.


81
0:3:32,46 --> 0:3:33,49
You do it yourself.


82
0:3:33,49 --> 0:3:36,13
You just exchang these
meaningless bits.


83
0:3:36,13 --> 0:3:40,23
And one of the really horrendous
legacies we're still stuck with


84
0:3:40,23 --> 0:3:41,93
is the idea the
carrier in the middle


85
0:3:41,93 --> 0:3:44,72
must make a profit for
you to do anything.


86
0:3:44,72 --> 0:3:46,559
And I was reminded of this.


87
0:3:46,559 --> 0:3:48,6
I understand why companies
need to make a profit,


88
0:3:48,6 --> 0:3:51,41
the question is whether
that's the right model.


89
0:3:51,41 --> 0:3:52,44
For example, airlines.


90
0:3:52,44 --> 0:3:55,4
I don't have a better
idea for airlines.


91
0:3:55,4 --> 0:3:57,525
But the consequence
is I'm not going


92
0:3:57,525 --> 0:4:0,48
to be able to get to Los Vegas
tomorrow because airlines


93
0:4:0,48 --> 0:4:3,7
no longer have enough
extra equipment.


94
0:4:3,7 --> 0:4:5,83
So basically, they
canceled my flight


95
0:4:5,83 --> 0:4:8,2
because a gear was
stuck somewhere


96
0:4:8,2 --> 0:4:9,88
and there's absolutely
no resilience.


97
0:4:9,88 --> 0:4:12,21
The whole system shuts down.


98
0:4:12,21 --> 0:4:14,2
And maybe airlines
have to do it.,


99
0:4:14,2 --> 0:4:16,829
but for us to use that
technology for networking


100
0:4:16,829 --> 0:4:19,2
is absurd.


101
0:4:19,2 --> 0:4:21,3
So as I said, the
internet is a technique


102
0:4:21,3 --> 0:4:23,9
for doing things ourselves.


103
0:4:23,9 --> 0:4:25,85
Now, I put in DIO
as a broader point


104
0:4:25,85 --> 0:4:29,82
because doing it ourselves
doesn't mean you do it alone.


105
0:4:29,82 --> 0:4:31,57
It could be doing
it ourselves if you


106
0:4:31,57 --> 0:4:34,63
have communities
that work together.


107
0:4:34,63 --> 0:4:38,38
But it's easy to just
think of DIY as opposed


108
0:4:38,38 --> 0:4:39,906
to depending on a third party.


109
0:4:39,906 --> 0:4:40,53
Do it yourself.


110
0:4:40,53 --> 0:4:45,194



111
0:4:45,194 --> 0:4:47,61
The other thing that we're
going to get to is once meaning


112
0:4:47,61 --> 0:4:51,72
is outside the
network-- oh, I just


113
0:4:51,72 --> 0:4:53,625
realized you're not
seeing my slides.


114
0:4:53,625 --> 0:4:55,0
MALE SPEAKER:
[INAUDIBLE] slides?


115
0:4:55,0 --> 0:4:56,96
BOB FRANKSTON: Yes,
there are slides here.


116
0:4:56,96 --> 0:4:59,65
I'm more coherent than I seem,
because the explanation is up


117
0:4:59,65 --> 0:5:1,68
on the slides.


118
0:5:1,68 --> 0:5:3,889
Speaking of depending
on a third party


119
0:5:3,889 --> 0:5:5,68
and not having eyes in
the back of my head.


120
0:5:5,68 --> 0:5:9,74



121
0:5:9,74 --> 0:5:10,88
Ah, there it is.


122
0:5:10,88 --> 0:5:12,85
I won't go back to
the other pictures,


123
0:5:12,85 --> 0:5:15,99
nor show my beautiful picture
of the trolley in the snow.


124
0:5:15,99 --> 0:5:18,742



125
0:5:18,742 --> 0:5:20,783
That explains why you were
actually looking at me


126
0:5:20,783 --> 0:5:21,741
and seemed to be awake.


127
0:5:21,741 --> 0:5:31,54



128
0:5:31,54 --> 0:5:33,81
I can go all the way back,
but that's not important.


129
0:5:33,81 --> 0:5:35,5
So there's where you
see DIY versus DIO.


130
0:5:35,5 --> 0:5:38,44
You wondered why I was-- OK.


131
0:5:38,44 --> 0:5:40,81
Do I seem more coherent
now that you can see it?


132
0:5:40,81 --> 0:5:41,93
OK.


133
0:5:41,93 --> 0:5:44,3
So what does this mean?


134
0:5:44,3 --> 0:5:48,76
This is really about taking
advantage of opportunities.


135
0:5:48,76 --> 0:5:52,65
And we're limited by
discovering what we can do.


136
0:5:52,65 --> 0:5:57,536
For example, voice over
IP was a discovery.


137
0:5:57,536 --> 0:5:59,16
Yes, we could get to
work in some cases


138
0:5:59,16 --> 0:6:3,79
in the early studies, but how
can you do voice over a-- when


139
0:6:3,79 --> 0:6:6,2
you lose your package,
you got high jitter.


140
0:6:6,2 --> 0:6:6,82
Just like TV.


141
0:6:6,82 --> 0:6:9,246
People thought we
need asynchronous TV.


142
0:6:9,246 --> 0:6:11,12
But some people were
creative and figured out


143
0:6:11,12 --> 0:6:13,369
ways to take advantage
of opportunities.


144
0:6:13,369 --> 0:6:14,535
Now it's not always obvious.


145
0:6:14,535 --> 0:6:17,39



146
0:6:17,39 --> 0:6:20,89
The reason VoIP it
works now has nothing


147
0:6:20,89 --> 0:6:23,156
to do with making VoIP work.


148
0:6:23,156 --> 0:6:26,64
It was the web that
gave us the capacity.


149
0:6:26,64 --> 0:6:29,72
If we try to make VoIP
work, we actually did.


150
0:6:29,72 --> 0:6:32,33
It's called SS7.


151
0:6:32,33 --> 0:6:34,354
Does anybody want to buy
a used phone network?


152
0:6:34,354 --> 0:6:35,645
It's too expensive to maintain.


153
0:6:35,645 --> 0:6:39,35



154
0:6:39,35 --> 0:6:43,15
But the key is to have an
appropriate business model.


155
0:6:43,15 --> 0:6:45,17
And this is one of
the main messages.


156
0:6:45,17 --> 0:6:48,2
So we don't need a third party
the middle like the airlines


157
0:6:48,2 --> 0:6:49,15
do.


158
0:6:49,15 --> 0:6:54,399
Have to run at the edge, to
only do what's profitable.


159
0:6:54,399 --> 0:6:56,19
It's sort of like
depending on the railroad


160
0:6:56,19 --> 0:6:58,16
to get to a destination.


161
0:6:58,16 --> 0:7:0,74
Not many railroads are willing
to tracks up Mount Everest.


162
0:7:0,74 --> 0:7:4,59



163
0:7:4,59 --> 0:7:7,18
So we want to get away from
this idea of the provider making


164
0:7:7,18 --> 0:7:9,9
profit for us to do anything.


165
0:7:9,9 --> 0:7:13,62
The other problem we have with
the current business model


166
0:7:13,62 --> 0:7:18,24
is that providers'
worst enemy, the people


167
0:7:18,24 --> 0:7:21,43
they fear the most,
the existential threat,


168
0:7:21,43 --> 0:7:23,96
are the customers.


169
0:7:23,96 --> 0:7:26,18
There's a customer
buying from Netflix


170
0:7:26,18 --> 0:7:28,215
will remove all the
profit of selling content,


171
0:7:28,215 --> 0:7:30,87
as the cable companies do now.


172
0:7:30,87 --> 0:7:34,2
And there's a slide show
I point to on my site


173
0:7:34,2 --> 0:7:39,96
from the cellular industry
explaining that abundance


174
0:7:39,96 --> 0:7:42,76
is the greatest threat.


175
0:7:42,76 --> 0:7:45,45
That if they don't
prevent abundance,


176
0:7:45,45 --> 0:7:48,65
people are not going
to buy the services.


177
0:7:48,65 --> 0:7:54,714
So if you wondered why there's
a problem with broadband crisis,


178
0:7:54,714 --> 0:7:55,255
it's obvious.


179
0:7:55,255 --> 0:7:58,54



180
0:7:58,54 --> 0:8:3,39
Giving the customers enough
capacity is a losing idea.


181
0:8:3,39 --> 0:8:4,67
So this is not sustainable.


182
0:8:4,67 --> 0:8:7,76
We need to have a
sustainable business model,


183
0:8:7,76 --> 0:8:11,88
and this is, again, Google,
since you use connectivity,


184
0:8:11,88 --> 0:8:13,15
to encourage capacity.


185
0:8:13,15 --> 0:8:19,25



186
0:8:19,25 --> 0:8:21,35
As I said, we exchange
references, not contact.


187
0:8:21,35 --> 0:8:25,12
Capacity is not the
same as bandwidth.


188
0:8:25,12 --> 0:8:27,324
It turns out we have
so much capacity,


189
0:8:27,324 --> 0:8:28,99
we're using, at the
first approximation,


190
0:8:28,99 --> 0:8:32,63
0% of our capacity.


191
0:8:32,63 --> 0:8:36,59
And that's what's a
conflict of interest.


192
0:8:36,59 --> 0:8:39,23
So there is an
alternative model,


193
0:8:39,23 --> 0:8:41,669
which is the way
we fund sidewalks.


194
0:8:41,669 --> 0:8:44,75
The sidewalk owner
does not view the user


195
0:8:44,75 --> 0:8:47,27
as a competitive threat.


196
0:8:47,27 --> 0:8:51,36
But people talk about
privatizing the Mass Pike.


197
0:8:51,36 --> 0:8:54,23
Then Route 30 becomes
a competitive threat.


198
0:8:54,23 --> 0:8:56,46
We already saw this in Detroit.


199
0:8:56,46 --> 0:8:58,919
There's a private
bridge in Detroit.


200
0:8:58,919 --> 0:9:1,21
They try to keep the city
from building a public bridge


201
0:9:1,21 --> 0:9:3,53
because it's competition.


202
0:9:3,53 --> 0:9:6,77
So you've really got to
be careful about what


203
0:9:6,77 --> 0:9:9,96
incentives we create.


204
0:9:9,96 --> 0:9:15,89
Now the resource I describe
as ambient connectivity,


205
0:9:15,89 --> 0:9:18,85
and I use this term for the
idea of wherever you are,


206
0:9:18,85 --> 0:9:20,86
you could just
assume connectivity.


207
0:9:20,86 --> 0:9:23,8
Now this is sort of like
having open Wi-Fi everywhere,


208
0:9:23,8 --> 0:9:27,92
except I don't want to tie it
to any particular technology.


209
0:9:27,92 --> 0:9:31,46
Current Wi-Fi is much
better than it might be,


210
0:9:31,46 --> 0:9:35,77
but it's still a
problematic technology.


211
0:9:35,77 --> 0:9:38,455
But the key is to
be able to assume


212
0:9:38,455 --> 0:9:39,85
we're connected wherever we are.


213
0:9:39,85 --> 0:9:41,4
I'll get more into this.


214
0:9:41,4 --> 0:9:45,37
I add the word permissionless
because people somehow


215
0:9:45,37 --> 0:9:48,42
seem to assume you've got to
show your credentials to prove


216
0:9:48,42 --> 0:9:49,52
you can pay for it.


217
0:9:49,52 --> 0:9:52,46
But how many of you
have to show that you're


218
0:9:52,46 --> 0:9:54,172
authorized to use a sidewalk?


219
0:9:54,172 --> 0:9:55,63
That's the exception,
not the rule.


220
0:9:55,63 --> 0:9:59,54



221
0:9:59,54 --> 0:10:4,4
And the thing to realize is
this whole idea of networking,


222
0:10:4,4 --> 0:10:8,0
we so implicitly have a
provider-centric view.


223
0:10:8,0 --> 0:10:10,255
We talk about the network
as what's important,


224
0:10:10,255 --> 0:10:12,2
and how you maintain
the network.


225
0:10:12,2 --> 0:10:14,585
And as we'll see, our
language, our framework


226
0:10:14,585 --> 0:10:18,8
is infused with a
provider-centric view


227
0:10:18,8 --> 0:10:21,7
of protocols and everything.


228
0:10:21,7 --> 0:10:23,61
What you have to do is
forget about the network.


229
0:10:23,61 --> 0:10:26,17
I want to be able to think
just about the relationships


230
0:10:26,17 --> 0:10:29,57
between the two endpoints and
what I'm trying to accomplish.


231
0:10:29,57 --> 0:10:30,874
It should just work everywhere.


232
0:10:30,874 --> 0:10:33,29
Or you shouldn't have to log
into this or connect to this.


233
0:10:33,29 --> 0:10:33,79
Yes?


234
0:10:33,79 --> 0:10:35,66
AUDIENCE: One of the
big struggles we've had


235
0:10:35,66 --> 0:10:39,575
is that users want to be
able to define what they get


236
0:10:39,575 --> 0:10:44,11
from an ISP, and the ISP is
usually unwilling to commit.


237
0:10:44,11 --> 0:10:46,81
BOB FRANKSTON: We shouldn't
have the concept of an ISP


238
0:10:46,81 --> 0:10:49,89
because the interent is not a
service that's being pumped out


239
0:10:49,89 --> 0:10:52,94
of the salt mines in Louisiana.


240
0:10:52,94 --> 0:10:54,82
It's what we do with
the available resources.


241
0:10:54,82 --> 0:10:55,986
The internet is a technique.


242
0:10:55,986 --> 0:10:58,58



243
0:10:58,58 --> 0:11:0,58
That's what I'm saying
about flipping the model.


244
0:11:0,58 --> 0:11:2,62
People assume they
have to ask the ISP.


245
0:11:2,62 --> 0:11:4,4
No, you're important.


246
0:11:4,4 --> 0:11:8,27
The ISP should come to you
and say, please, I want a job.


247
0:11:8,27 --> 0:11:9,46
Can I do anything for you?


248
0:11:9,46 --> 0:11:18,51



249
0:11:18,51 --> 0:11:20,26
I'm very interested
in how language works,


250
0:11:20,26 --> 0:11:22,385
so I have to use language
people are familiar with.


251
0:11:22,385 --> 0:11:25,65
So I say open access, even
though words like that


252
0:11:25,65 --> 0:11:26,19
are still provider-centric.


253
0:11:26,19 --> 0:11:28,88



254
0:11:28,88 --> 0:11:32,786
One of the big words we use,
terrible words, is broadband.


255
0:11:32,786 --> 0:11:33,535
What is broadband?


256
0:11:33,535 --> 0:11:37,51



257
0:11:37,51 --> 0:11:39,414
AUDIENCE: Effectively, a
bigger pipe than the other.


258
0:11:39,414 --> 0:11:40,83
BOB FRANKSTON:
Well actually, it's


259
0:11:40,83 --> 0:11:44,13
a technical term that comes
from radio technology.


260
0:11:44,13 --> 0:11:48,16
It turns out the companies that
extended the TV antennas up


261
0:11:48,16 --> 0:11:51,2
the top of the mountain took the
broadband over the air signals


262
0:11:51,2 --> 0:11:54,82
and put it on a coaxial
cable, versus baseband.


263
0:11:54,82 --> 0:11:57,505
And that became-- we're going
to give examples later--


264
0:11:57,505 --> 0:11:59,463
associated with a business
model because that's


265
0:11:59,463 --> 0:12:0,421
the way language works.


266
0:12:0,421 --> 0:12:2,8



267
0:12:2,8 --> 0:12:7,87
And then it became
literally a contronym.


268
0:12:7,87 --> 0:12:10,12
Literally itself has
become a contronym.


269
0:12:10,12 --> 0:12:13,8
A contronym is a word
that's its own antonym.


270
0:12:13,8 --> 0:12:14,98
And the way language
works, literally fills


271
0:12:14,98 --> 0:12:16,61
in the same slot
as figuratively,


272
0:12:16,61 --> 0:12:18,59
so people tend to
confuse the two.


273
0:12:18,59 --> 0:12:21,839
So broadband we use to mean the
internet, when the internet is


274
0:12:21,839 --> 0:12:24,38
really what you tunnel through
despite the broadband business


275
0:12:24,38 --> 0:12:26,56
model.


276
0:12:26,56 --> 0:12:29,19
This is what makes it so
hard to talk about this.


277
0:12:29,19 --> 0:12:31,674
And I have to emphasize, I'm
talking about an architecture,


278
0:12:31,674 --> 0:12:33,9
not any particular
implementation.


279
0:12:33,9 --> 0:12:38,37
So when I talk about having open
Wi-Fi, that's just an example.


280
0:12:38,37 --> 0:12:39,4
It's one way to do it.


281
0:12:39,4 --> 0:12:42,184



282
0:12:42,184 --> 0:12:43,975
What amazes me is how
often it's, oh, we'll


283
0:12:43,975 --> 0:12:46,49
give you wireless mesh.


284
0:12:46,49 --> 0:12:48,85
First, why do I say wireless?


285
0:12:48,85 --> 0:12:51,8
A wire is just a wave
guide for signals.


286
0:12:51,8 --> 0:12:53,98
There's nothing
wrong with wires.


287
0:12:53,98 --> 0:12:56,135
And mesh is just a
particular technology.


288
0:12:56,135 --> 0:12:58,51
And if I've got a fiber that
takes me across the country,


289
0:12:58,51 --> 0:13:0,87
why do I want a bucket brigade?


290
0:13:0,87 --> 0:13:3,5
It's an economic
problem to solve,


291
0:13:3,5 --> 0:13:5,2
and technology's just a means.


292
0:13:5,2 --> 0:13:6,69
What we do have
to do is preserve


293
0:13:6,69 --> 0:13:9,47
the magic of it just works.


294
0:13:9,47 --> 0:13:11,54
And that's the real
architectural goal.


295
0:13:11,54 --> 0:13:14,34
That's the power
of architecture.


296
0:13:14,34 --> 0:13:15,38
Network just disappears.


297
0:13:15,38 --> 0:13:18,44



298
0:13:18,44 --> 0:13:21,344
And apps can use any available
means, including the QR codes.


299
0:13:21,344 --> 0:13:23,1
So if we're just
exchanging a reference,


300
0:13:23,1 --> 0:13:25,85
I just give you a QR code.


301
0:13:25,85 --> 0:13:28,54
So one way to explain
this is our view


302
0:13:28,54 --> 0:13:30,82
of the history of
what I call digital.


303
0:13:30,82 --> 0:13:33,7
Now when I say digital,
I mean discrete symbols.


304
0:13:33,7 --> 0:13:35,7
It doesn't mean 10 fingers.


305
0:13:35,7 --> 0:13:38,5
But the fact that we can
have these sharp distinctions


306
0:13:38,5 --> 0:13:40,76
and you can regenerate
the meaning.


307
0:13:40,76 --> 0:13:41,72
That's the real value.


308
0:13:41,72 --> 0:13:43,95
The zeroes and ones are
going to be regenerated.


309
0:13:43,95 --> 0:13:46,1
But it's also alphabets.


310
0:13:46,1 --> 0:13:51,16
If I write letters,
even-- . pictographics.


311
0:13:51,16 --> 0:13:53,63
Hieroglyphics were
very distinct symbols.


312
0:13:53,63 --> 0:13:56,4
Little off, you can
guess what it is again.


313
0:13:56,4 --> 0:13:59,772
And that allowed the message
to be preserved over distance.


314
0:13:59,772 --> 0:14:0,855
You can carry the message.


315
0:14:0,855 --> 0:14:2,47
If it got a little distorted,
you can correct it.


316
0:14:2,47 --> 0:14:3,19
Smudged.


317
0:14:3,19 --> 0:14:5,49
But also over time.


318
0:14:5,49 --> 0:14:7,9
And we actually had some
forward error correcting


319
0:14:7,9 --> 0:14:9,57
oral traditions,
but that's for when


320
0:14:9,57 --> 0:14:12,58
you want a discussion
of details of language.


321
0:14:12,58 --> 0:14:19,37
But one of the legacies
of the early days


322
0:14:19,37 --> 0:14:22,37
of inarticulate digital
is the telegraph.


323
0:14:22,37 --> 0:14:25,682
We had to use the wire to
keep the single contained,


324
0:14:25,682 --> 0:14:27,64
to maintain the relationships
between the bits,


325
0:14:27,64 --> 0:14:28,82
the endpoints.


326
0:14:28,82 --> 0:14:33,92
So it flooded our skies
with all these wires.


327
0:14:33,92 --> 0:14:37,41
Every call needed its own wire.


328
0:14:37,41 --> 0:14:40,46
And you think that's bad?


329
0:14:40,46 --> 0:14:42,55
Even when we had
wireless, no wires,


330
0:14:42,55 --> 0:14:44,79
we created virtual wires.


331
0:14:44,79 --> 0:14:49,31
This cockamamie idea of
single frequency signaling


332
0:14:49,31 --> 0:14:51,95
creates scarcity.


333
0:14:51,95 --> 0:14:55,9
It's as if we said no
two people in the room


334
0:14:55,9 --> 0:14:59,38
could wear a blue shirt
because it'll be confused.


335
0:14:59,38 --> 0:15:1,96
Interference is not a
property of physics.


336
0:15:1,96 --> 0:15:3,83
Waves pass through each other.


337
0:15:3,83 --> 0:15:7,246
Interference is another
word for confusion.


338
0:15:7,246 --> 0:15:9,12
So whenever anybody
talks about interference,


339
0:15:9,12 --> 0:15:10,994
they're just saying
we're creating confusion.


340
0:15:10,994 --> 0:15:14,77
If you use all the rich
data, and in a sense,


341
0:15:14,77 --> 0:15:17,23
if you look at meaning
come from context,


342
0:15:17,23 --> 0:15:19,78
big data's fundamental.


343
0:15:19,78 --> 0:15:22,85
Information in isolation
is meaningless.


344
0:15:22,85 --> 0:15:24,79
Yet our
telecommunications system


345
0:15:24,79 --> 0:15:26,8
is trying to
carefully preserve--


346
0:15:26,8 --> 0:15:28,257
this is the
inarticulate digital.


347
0:15:28,257 --> 0:15:30,9
We have to carefully
preserve all this stuff


348
0:15:30,9 --> 0:15:33,53
because-- it's a great
hack, by the way.


349
0:15:33,53 --> 0:15:38,7
The tuning fork was a
wonderful discovery back then.


350
0:15:38,7 --> 0:15:40,54
The fact it's been used to
compromise the Constitution


351
0:15:40,54 --> 0:15:44,26
and prevent free speech,
well, collateral damage.


352
0:15:44,26 --> 0:15:47,97
The other reminder is that
business models-- again,


353
0:15:47,97 --> 0:15:50,66
like broadband,
the business model


354
0:15:50,66 --> 0:15:56,7
came from the accidental
properties of history.


355
0:15:56,7 --> 0:15:59,46
The single frequency
single hop signal


356
0:15:59,46 --> 0:16:2,41
gave us the business
model of radio.


357
0:16:2,41 --> 0:16:6,7
And if I make it to CS this
year, I ask about radio,


358
0:16:6,7 --> 0:16:10,34
I've found Pandora is radio.


359
0:16:10,34 --> 0:16:13,902
Tubes and transistors
are no longer radio.


360
0:16:13,902 --> 0:16:14,735
Beware the language.


361
0:16:14,735 --> 0:16:17,53



362
0:16:17,53 --> 0:16:22,94
The talking telegraph
really created havoc.


363
0:16:22,94 --> 0:16:24,29
We had this great technology.


364
0:16:24,29 --> 0:16:27,73
Digital can cover any distance.


365
0:16:27,73 --> 0:16:29,5
And then this guy
across the river


366
0:16:29,5 --> 0:16:31,73
there disobeyed
his father-in-law,


367
0:16:31,73 --> 0:16:33,94
stole an idea from
Elisha Gray, who


368
0:16:33,94 --> 0:16:38,5
retired to West [INAUDIBLE], and
created the talking telegraph


369
0:16:38,5 --> 0:16:42,91
using analog technology,
and made a mess of things.


370
0:16:42,91 --> 0:16:46,19
Distance now became difficult.


371
0:16:46,19 --> 0:16:47,6
Distance used to be easy.


372
0:16:47,6 --> 0:16:49,33
Telegraph would go
over any distance.


373
0:16:49,33 --> 0:16:52,19
Distance became hard.


374
0:16:52,19 --> 0:16:55,86
And with that explicit
understanding,


375
0:16:55,86 --> 0:16:59,86
we could tune things, we could
tune knobs and all this stuff.


376
0:16:59,86 --> 0:17:3,55
But it was very hard to preserve
a signal across the street,


377
0:17:3,55 --> 0:17:6,3
let alone across the country.


378
0:17:6,3 --> 0:17:10,52
So this guy Claude Shannon
did a lot of research,


379
0:17:10,52 --> 0:17:12,849
created this whole
technology for how


380
0:17:12,849 --> 0:17:15,96
to preserve a
signal within wire.


381
0:17:15,96 --> 0:17:16,99
Within the channel.


382
0:17:16,99 --> 0:17:18,411
He didn't use the term wire.


383
0:17:18,411 --> 0:17:19,16
He used a channel.


384
0:17:19,16 --> 0:17:22,5
It wasn't very abstract term.


385
0:17:22,5 --> 0:17:26,24
He called it information for
the same reason physicists,


386
0:17:26,24 --> 0:17:29,54
we'll point out, like
to use words like work.


387
0:17:29,54 --> 0:17:32,13
Well we have giant
brains, all this notation,


388
0:17:32,13 --> 0:17:34,32
anthropomorphic notation.


389
0:17:34,32 --> 0:17:38,66
We use the word communicate
as if these wires carried


390
0:17:38,66 --> 0:17:40,98
our meaning.


391
0:17:40,98 --> 0:17:43,515
And we're still
living in that legacy.


392
0:17:43,515 --> 0:17:46,5



393
0:17:46,5 --> 0:17:49,71
Matter of fact, here
it's more than a century


394
0:17:49,71 --> 0:17:53,4
after that picture I
showed you of the wires


395
0:17:53,4 --> 0:17:56,61
covering all the streets,
yet it's even worse.


396
0:17:56,61 --> 0:17:59,4
All we've done in a
century and a half


397
0:17:59,4 --> 0:18:1,2
is learn how to
take all those wires


398
0:18:1,2 --> 0:18:5,31
and bundle them up very neatly
into little tiny packages.


399
0:18:5,31 --> 0:18:8,38
And worse, we have
multiple bundles and wires


400
0:18:8,38 --> 0:18:11,82
from competing
bundlers, or bunglers,


401
0:18:11,82 --> 0:18:13,8
whatever you want to call them.


402
0:18:13,8 --> 0:18:15,32
And it's even worse.


403
0:18:15,32 --> 0:18:17,49
Inside each of those we
have virtual circuits


404
0:18:17,49 --> 0:18:19,375
to maintain each conversation.


405
0:18:19,375 --> 0:18:22,2



406
0:18:22,2 --> 0:18:25,14
Now how you can maintain a
business model of carrying bits


407
0:18:25,14 --> 0:18:30,44
where there's no longer
any way to compete.


408
0:18:30,44 --> 0:18:31,46
In other words,
they're just bits.


409
0:18:31,46 --> 0:18:32,34
They're generic bits.


410
0:18:32,34 --> 0:18:35,36
How you differentiate.


411
0:18:35,36 --> 0:18:36,96
But the reason we
have the legacy


412
0:18:36,96 --> 0:18:39,72
is we're still stuck
in stage two, the idea


413
0:18:39,72 --> 0:18:42,3
that you need
pipes, pipes, pipes.


414
0:18:42,3 --> 0:18:44,69
And it comes out in many ways.


415
0:18:44,69 --> 0:18:48,21
One is carriers don't
want to become dumb pipes.


416
0:18:48,21 --> 0:18:50,2
Sorry.


417
0:18:50,2 --> 0:18:53,85
That's not the worst
of it, is the fact


418
0:18:53,85 --> 0:18:54,91
we don't need pipes anymore.


419
0:18:54,91 --> 0:18:56,58
Bits are all
self-identified, meaning


420
0:18:56,58 --> 0:18:58,46
it's assembled
outside the network.


421
0:18:58,46 --> 0:18:59,82
We don't need pipes.


422
0:18:59,82 --> 0:19:5,79
Yet our business models
are still pipe-based.


423
0:19:5,79 --> 0:19:7,92
Now the digital technology
that gave us computers


424
0:19:7,92 --> 0:19:10,411
did set the stage
for the future.


425
0:19:10,411 --> 0:19:11,971
But we first have
to-- again, this


426
0:19:11,971 --> 0:19:13,72
is why I brought up
the issue of language.


427
0:19:13,72 --> 0:19:17,46
How many people think physicists
should run the NLRB, National


428
0:19:17,46 --> 0:19:21,5
Labor Relations Board, because
they understand what work is?


429
0:19:21,5 --> 0:19:24,29
Why would a double
E be allowed to run


430
0:19:24,29 --> 0:19:27,68
a school of communications
and the PR department?


431
0:19:27,68 --> 0:19:30,9
Those people understand
communications.


432
0:19:30,9 --> 0:19:33,15
Apparently E's don't because
they confuse information


433
0:19:33,15 --> 0:19:35,69
in the Shannon sense.


434
0:19:35,69 --> 0:19:40,25
How much information is there
in not answering a question?


435
0:19:40,25 --> 0:19:41,685
Or in a pause?


436
0:19:41,685 --> 0:19:44,6
There are people who spend a
lot of time figuring it out,


437
0:19:44,6 --> 0:19:44,89
and you have to slap
them and say, no.


438
0:19:44,89 --> 0:19:45,99
That's a stupid question.


439
0:19:45,99 --> 0:19:49,7



440
0:19:49,7 --> 0:19:54,282
Now this sets the stage for
what I'm calling stage three.


441
0:19:54,282 --> 0:19:55,99
Now we're very interested
in [INAUDIBLE],


442
0:19:55,99 --> 0:20:0,87
but I took a class in spring
of 1973 from Mike Hammer.


443
0:20:0,87 --> 0:20:4,34
Does anybody remember Mike
Hammer, reengineering?


444
0:20:4,34 --> 0:20:5,82
It was studying networks.


445
0:20:5,82 --> 0:20:7,57
So one of things we
studied was ALOHAnet.


446
0:20:7,57 --> 0:20:11,2



447
0:20:11,2 --> 0:20:14,15
How many people here
know about ALOHAnet?


448
0:20:14,15 --> 0:20:14,65
OK.


449
0:20:14,65 --> 0:20:17,5
It was a radio packet
network in Hawaii.


450
0:20:17,5 --> 0:20:18,82
Do It yourself packet network.


451
0:20:18,82 --> 0:20:21,45
There had been various
experiments integrating packet


452
0:20:21,45 --> 0:20:23,692
networks, but I
remember ALOHA was


453
0:20:23,692 --> 0:20:26,78
the one we studied in class.


454
0:20:26,78 --> 0:20:30,43
And basically it was
what any hacker would do.


455
0:20:30,43 --> 0:20:31,96
It looks at a packet
and resends it.


456
0:20:31,96 --> 0:20:33,134
No big deal.


457
0:20:33,134 --> 0:20:34,55
Maybe it's the
latest temperature.


458
0:20:34,55 --> 0:20:35,383
You don't resend it.


459
0:20:35,383 --> 0:20:38,1
You just give them temperature.


460
0:20:38,1 --> 0:20:39,55
I mean, we called it a net.


461
0:20:39,55 --> 0:20:44,14
It was ALOHAnet, but it was a
network in the sense Facebook


462
0:20:44,14 --> 0:20:48,68
is a network, or, sorry,
Google+ is a network.


463
0:20:48,68 --> 0:20:51,6
It's a social network.


464
0:20:51,6 --> 0:20:53,34
That's the problem
with language again.


465
0:20:53,34 --> 0:20:56,57
This is why I'm so
fascinated by language.


466
0:20:56,57 --> 0:20:58,58
The word network is
so general as to be


467
0:20:58,58 --> 0:21:0,61
totally useless
for communicating.


468
0:21:0,61 --> 0:21:2,17
Worse than useless.


469
0:21:2,17 --> 0:21:3,914
It sort of like diplomacy.


470
0:21:3,914 --> 0:21:5,58
You can both use the
same word, but mean


471
0:21:5,58 --> 0:21:6,663
entirely different things.


472
0:21:6,663 --> 0:21:9,76
But you think you're
talking to each other.


473
0:21:9,76 --> 0:21:12,15
And at the end of the class,
some other kid sitting next


474
0:21:12,15 --> 0:21:15,54
to me-- this is May 1973,
did his baseband project.


475
0:21:15,54 --> 0:21:18,634
He took ALOHA and
put it on a coax.


476
0:21:18,634 --> 0:21:20,55
Now I wanted to do it
over the campus network,


477
0:21:20,55 --> 0:21:21,758
it would have been broadband.


478
0:21:21,758 --> 0:21:25,17
But I didn't follow through,
so it doesn't count.


479
0:21:25,17 --> 0:21:27,8
But it was obvious
this is a great hack.


480
0:21:27,8 --> 0:21:32,98
2.994 megabits,
as he reminds me.


481
0:21:32,98 --> 0:21:36,4
That's Bob Metcalfe, you know.


482
0:21:36,4 --> 0:21:37,3
It was wonderful.


483
0:21:37,3 --> 0:21:42,19
But to get his Doctorate he
had to prove to the EE people


484
0:21:42,19 --> 0:21:43,58
that it would perform well.


485
0:21:43,58 --> 0:21:44,86
Turns out he was wrong.


486
0:21:44,86 --> 0:21:47,63
It performed much better
than his thesis said.


487
0:21:47,63 --> 0:21:51,95



488
0:21:51,95 --> 0:21:57,25
So how many of you are familiar
with the paradigms framings?


489
0:21:57,25 --> 0:22:0,16
When you change a paradigm,
everything changes.


490
0:22:0,16 --> 0:22:1,94
So when Copernicus
did his little thing


491
0:22:1,94 --> 0:22:5,442
of moving a reference
point 93 million miles,


492
0:22:5,442 --> 0:22:7,61
it was a nice
mathematical hack, and it


493
0:22:7,61 --> 0:22:9,67
did make navigation easier.


494
0:22:9,67 --> 0:22:11,515
But it had two
side effects, which


495
0:22:11,515 --> 0:22:12,86
he wouldn't have anticipated.


496
0:22:12,86 --> 0:22:15,95
One, it destroyed
people's idea that they


497
0:22:15,95 --> 0:22:19,2
were the middle of the universe.


498
0:22:19,2 --> 0:22:21,53
And that made it
very hard to accept.


499
0:22:21,53 --> 0:22:23,505
And I'm telling you
meaning is not fundamental,


500
0:22:23,505 --> 0:22:26,77
if you want a scary concept.


501
0:22:26,77 --> 0:22:30,59
The other thing it did was
give Newton his physics.


502
0:22:30,59 --> 0:22:33,3
Because suddenly you
could see a uniformity out


503
0:22:33,3 --> 0:22:35,316
of all these disparate
things, and you just


504
0:22:35,316 --> 0:22:37,61
get a deeper understanding.


505
0:22:37,61 --> 0:22:42,99
And in that sense, what the
packet radios forced us to do


506
0:22:42,99 --> 0:22:46,94
was learn how to preserve
meaning outside of the network.


507
0:22:46,94 --> 0:22:50,18
Discover what we can do
with the opportunities.


508
0:22:50,18 --> 0:22:54,83
And that, I argue, is the
real origin of the internet.


509
0:22:54,83 --> 0:22:57,23
Learning how to solve
problems ourselves,


510
0:22:57,23 --> 0:23:0,99
learning the techniques for
using any available resource


511
0:23:0,99 --> 0:23:7,17
as a way to communicate in the
human sense, not just EE sense.


512
0:23:7,17 --> 0:23:10,75
And that's why I say a
fundamental discontinuity,


513
0:23:10,75 --> 0:23:14,18
yet we're still thinking
stage two because, as I said,


514
0:23:14,18 --> 0:23:16,23
language, information,
communications.


515
0:23:16,23 --> 0:23:19,83
It just sounds just like the
railroads of the 19th century.


516
0:23:19,83 --> 0:23:22,99
And in fact, we have a
thing called the Federal


517
0:23:22,99 --> 0:23:25,3
Communications Commission.


518
0:23:25,3 --> 0:23:30,9
What do they mean
by communications?


519
0:23:30,9 --> 0:23:33,66
What's worse is they're
explicitly spun off


520
0:23:33,66 --> 0:23:37,27
from the ICC, Interstate
Commerce Commission, which


521
0:23:37,27 --> 0:23:39,18
managed railroads.


522
0:23:39,18 --> 0:23:40,61
Now that's gone.


523
0:23:40,61 --> 0:23:43,26
It's been replaced by the
Department of Transportation,


524
0:23:43,26 --> 0:23:48,44
which manages the
means we use to travel.


525
0:23:48,44 --> 0:23:51,56
It does not manage the
actual freight itself.


526
0:23:51,56 --> 0:23:53,92
In the meantime,
the FCC is there


527
0:23:53,92 --> 0:23:56,422
telling us what words
we're allowed to use,


528
0:23:56,422 --> 0:23:57,88
how we're allowed
to run elections.


529
0:23:57,88 --> 0:24:0,46
Really weird.


530
0:24:0,46 --> 0:24:3,27
You'd think these people didn't
understand how to communicate.


531
0:24:3,27 --> 0:24:5,32
And we're still compromising
the First Amendment


532
0:24:5,32 --> 0:24:8,23
by creating scarcity in order
to keep the business alive.


533
0:24:8,23 --> 0:24:11,23
So the internet happened when
we're interconnected the LANs.


534
0:24:11,23 --> 0:24:13,826
The LAN, you were , anywhere,
plugged into the coax,


535
0:24:13,826 --> 0:24:16,4
you were just there.


536
0:24:16,4 --> 0:24:19,44
But the consequence
of that was you


537
0:24:19,44 --> 0:24:23,1
could not see beyond
the individual packet.


538
0:24:23,1 --> 0:24:26,28
So therefore, we had
to have a system--


539
0:24:26,28 --> 0:24:30,48
and this is the real insight--
to separate TCP from IP.


540
0:24:30,48 --> 0:24:33,2
And it wasn't just
Vince or Bob Kahn.


541
0:24:33,2 --> 0:24:34,51
There were a number of others.


542
0:24:34,51 --> 0:24:36,63
David Reed locally,
and Dave Clark,


543
0:24:36,63 --> 0:24:38,21
and all these other people.


544
0:24:38,21 --> 0:24:43,51
How do you preserve an
application relationship


545
0:24:43,51 --> 0:24:47,37
independent, when you could just
exchange nothing above packets?


546
0:24:47,37 --> 0:24:51,0



547
0:24:51,0 --> 0:24:52,93
And this where the
end-to-end argument.


548
0:24:52,93 --> 0:24:55,855
You had to have meaning
outside the application.


549
0:24:55,855 --> 0:25:2,43



550
0:25:2,43 --> 0:25:5,34
The earlier slide said
TCP, mentioned explicitly.


551
0:25:5,34 --> 0:25:10,14
What TCP is, it says
transmission control protocol.


552
0:25:10,14 --> 0:25:12,7
Very interesting.


553
0:25:12,7 --> 0:25:17,394
Because if all you want
to do was make sure


554
0:25:17,394 --> 0:25:18,81
all the bits got
through, you keep


555
0:25:18,81 --> 0:25:21,3
retrying til it gets through.


556
0:25:21,3 --> 0:25:23,64
But TCP was also protocol
for cooperatively


557
0:25:23,64 --> 0:25:27,86
sharing the resources in the
middle by detecting congestion,


558
0:25:27,86 --> 0:25:29,37
by backing off.


559
0:25:29,37 --> 0:25:32,63
And what's amazing is
how well that worked.


560
0:25:32,63 --> 0:25:37,97
That it's really a social
protocol for sharing resources.


561
0:25:37,97 --> 0:25:40,21
It's not just a reliable
stream protocol.


562
0:25:40,21 --> 0:25:43,8



563
0:25:43,8 --> 0:25:46,109
And basically, yes,
you can violate it,


564
0:25:46,109 --> 0:25:48,15
but if more than a few
people violate a collapse,


565
0:25:48,15 --> 0:25:50,48
you get immediate feedback,
people used standard libraries.


566
0:25:50,48 --> 0:25:51,75
So it's a whole
interesting discussion


567
0:25:51,75 --> 0:25:52,84
about why that works.


568
0:25:52,84 --> 0:25:56,634
And sociologists should
study this some more.


569
0:25:56,634 --> 0:25:58,55
And I won't go into
problems like buffer blow.


570
0:25:58,55 --> 0:25:59,945
There were lots of other issues.


571
0:25:59,945 --> 0:26:2,72



572
0:26:2,72 --> 0:26:5,59
So where I come into this,
and this much prouder


573
0:26:5,59 --> 0:26:7,95
than doing VisiCalc,
was home networks.


574
0:26:7,95 --> 0:26:11,33



575
0:26:11,33 --> 0:26:15,97
The original triple play plan,
or n-tuple play. [INAUDIBLE]


576
0:26:15,97 --> 0:26:17,32
is a good example.


577
0:26:17,32 --> 0:26:20,54
They would haul a
pipe into your house.


578
0:26:20,54 --> 0:26:24,852
They would put an a ATM
card cage in the basement.


579
0:26:24,852 --> 0:26:26,31
ATM was asynchronous
transfer mode.


580
0:26:26,31 --> 0:26:28,39
The base for DSL.


581
0:26:28,39 --> 0:26:30,46
I'll try to avoid too
much acronym soup.


582
0:26:30,46 --> 0:26:32,1
By the way, ADSL is interesting.


583
0:26:32,1 --> 0:26:34,46
You know why DSL exists?


584
0:26:34,46 --> 0:26:37,14
For interactive TV.


585
0:26:37,14 --> 0:26:38,64
It was not created
for the internet.


586
0:26:38,64 --> 0:26:41,92
That was a later repurposing.


587
0:26:41,92 --> 0:26:43,642
There's a lot of
repurposing discovery.


588
0:26:43,642 --> 0:26:45,725
Hindsight history makes
things look so purposeful.


589
0:26:45,725 --> 0:26:48,59



590
0:26:48,59 --> 0:26:51,26
People have a reason
for everything.


591
0:26:51,26 --> 0:26:54,46
But if you remember
at the beginning


592
0:26:54,46 --> 0:26:58,92
when you had to run a separate
wire for reach relationship,


593
0:26:58,92 --> 0:27:1,135
well those wires,
virtual wires were


594
0:27:1,135 --> 0:27:4,65
inside a pipe or any
other triple plays.


595
0:27:4,65 --> 0:27:7,82
Each phone line was
delivered to the card cage.


596
0:27:7,82 --> 0:27:10,61
In the early days, remember,
the phone companies


597
0:27:10,61 --> 0:27:12,5
owned your phone.


598
0:27:12,5 --> 0:27:16,79
The service was
the conversation.


599
0:27:16,79 --> 0:27:21,2
It was not the wires
coming into your house.


600
0:27:21,2 --> 0:27:24,27
And therefore in
the 1950s, AT&T had


601
0:27:24,27 --> 0:27:27,232
to be sued to allow you
put a box around a phone.


602
0:27:27,232 --> 0:27:29,69
it was a kind of device called
the Hush-A-Phone compromised


603
0:27:29,69 --> 0:27:33,73
the quality of the service and
dispersed their reputation.


604
0:27:33,73 --> 0:27:37,76
Later the Carterfone
allowed your equipment on,


605
0:27:37,76 --> 0:27:40,99
but the Hush-A-Phone, I think
was a more interesting case.


606
0:27:40,99 --> 0:27:42,98
Where the boundary
of the service is.


607
0:27:42,98 --> 0:27:46,9



608
0:27:46,9 --> 0:27:48,7
And you can see the example
of how that works in practice.


609
0:27:48,7 --> 0:27:51,43
Carriers would want to
charge for each IP address


610
0:27:51,43 --> 0:27:53,69
as if it were a phone number.


611
0:27:53,69 --> 0:27:56,84
You're going to pay
for each IP address.


612
0:27:56,84 --> 0:27:58,35
Since they looked
inside your house,


613
0:27:58,35 --> 0:28:1,14
they can do things like
trying to ban webcams


614
0:28:1,14 --> 0:28:3,275
because those were an
abuse of their service.


615
0:28:3,275 --> 0:28:7,21



616
0:28:7,21 --> 0:28:9,57
It really [INAUDIBLE] home.


617
0:28:9,57 --> 0:28:14,124
Repurposing a video distribution
service, rethink connectivity.


618
0:28:14,124 --> 0:28:16,665
And today, the modern version
of that is called Google Fiber.


619
0:28:16,665 --> 0:28:19,23



620
0:28:19,23 --> 0:28:22,57
And Google Fiber's
attitude is you can share.


621
0:28:22,57 --> 0:28:24,79
They're telling you what
you do with the bits.


622
0:28:24,79 --> 0:28:30,24
Now what company
would be so evil


623
0:28:30,24 --> 0:28:33,34
AUDIENCE: Are you referring
to the no servers allowed?


624
0:28:33,34 --> 0:28:35,225
BOB FRANKSTON: No,
that the least of it.


625
0:28:35,225 --> 0:28:36,59
AUDIENCE: That is [INAUDIBLE].


626
0:28:36,59 --> 0:28:37,881
BOB FRANKSTON: No I understand.


627
0:28:37,881 --> 0:28:39,27
Verizon had the same attitude.


628
0:28:39,27 --> 0:28:41,79
And the nice thing
about terms of service--


629
0:28:41,79 --> 0:28:43,415
I'll be nice to the
FCC, so I won't say


630
0:28:43,415 --> 0:28:47,8
fuck them-- but back when I
was doing home networking--


631
0:28:47,8 --> 0:28:49,525
and I'll get into
that-- I basically


632
0:28:49,525 --> 0:28:50,9
ignored the terms of service.


633
0:28:50,9 --> 0:28:53,2
Because the phone
companies said you're not


634
0:28:53,2 --> 0:28:56,88
allowed to add more than
one PC to your home network.


635
0:28:56,88 --> 0:28:57,824
To the router.


636
0:28:57,824 --> 0:28:59,24
They're going to
tell you what you


637
0:28:59,24 --> 0:29:3,256
can do with the device
inside your own home.


638
0:29:3,256 --> 0:29:4,645
AUDIENCE: So for
the Google Fiber


639
0:29:4,645 --> 0:29:6,46
no sharing, you mean
you can't [INAUDIBLE]


640
0:29:6,46 --> 0:29:8,5
community over to watch TV?


641
0:29:8,5 --> 0:29:9,9
BOB FRANKSTON: No,
it's not just watch TV.


642
0:29:9,9 --> 0:29:11,7
If I have a Google
Fiber programs,


643
0:29:11,7 --> 0:29:14,47
I'm not allowed to share that
connection with my neighbor.


644
0:29:14,47 --> 0:29:17,109
Now I can understand
the business model point


645
0:29:17,109 --> 0:29:19,275
of view, which is why you
need a business model that


646
0:29:19,275 --> 0:29:22,22
doesn't create such
terrible behavior.


647
0:29:22,22 --> 0:29:24,9
But are there people
who try to bring,


648
0:29:24,9 --> 0:29:25,48
like housing communities.


649
0:29:25,48 --> 0:29:27,59
You want to bring
broadband to the poor.


650
0:29:27,59 --> 0:29:29,28
You got a gigabit.


651
0:29:29,28 --> 0:29:33,94
That'll serve complete
apartment houses.


652
0:29:33,94 --> 0:29:36,4
Steve [INAUDIBLE] here
uses just a few megabits


653
0:29:36,4 --> 0:29:38,26
to serve the
[INAUDIBLE] project.


654
0:29:38,26 --> 0:29:41,802
So that it's as if you-- yes?


655
0:29:41,802 --> 0:29:42,784
AUDIENCE: Yes.


656
0:29:42,784 --> 0:29:44,765
[INAUDIBLE] one gigabit.


657
0:29:44,765 --> 0:29:45,89
BOB FRANKSTON: No it's not.


658
0:29:45,89 --> 0:29:46,84
You play the odds.


659
0:29:46,84 --> 0:29:48,24
Sure.


660
0:29:48,24 --> 0:29:51,2
But let people
discover what it does.


661
0:29:51,2 --> 0:29:53,91
AUDIENCE: Providers
tell you up front, yes,


662
0:29:53,91 --> 0:29:55,493
you may have one
gigabit of bandwidth,


663
0:29:55,493 --> 0:29:56,447
but you only have 5%.


664
0:29:56,447 --> 0:29:59,31



665
0:29:59,31 --> 0:30:0,73
BOB FRANKSTON: Yeah.


666
0:30:0,73 --> 0:30:2,4
Let the people decide
and discover that.


667
0:30:2,4 --> 0:30:3,1
Sure.


668
0:30:3,1 --> 0:30:5,47
But it's sort of
like a sidewalk.


669
0:30:5,47 --> 0:30:9,9
We're going to limit how many
people can live in the house.


670
0:30:9,9 --> 0:30:11,74
This is where you have
the idea of discovering


671
0:30:11,74 --> 0:30:13,43
what you can do from the edge.


672
0:30:13,43 --> 0:30:16,34



673
0:30:16,34 --> 0:30:19,26
I don't want guarantees.


674
0:30:19,26 --> 0:30:23,1
The reason Skype can do video
is because Skype does not


675
0:30:23,1 --> 0:30:24,95
promise to do video.


676
0:30:24,95 --> 0:30:28,59
If they promised video,
they could not do video.


677
0:30:28,59 --> 0:30:30,42
There are a lot of
counterintuitive aspects


678
0:30:30,42 --> 0:30:31,92
here, which is why
you have to start


679
0:30:31,92 --> 0:30:35,89
thinking from the
resource and from outside.


680
0:30:35,89 --> 0:30:37,87
And you also have some
interesting things,


681
0:30:37,87 --> 0:30:39,77
like if you're
above a threshold,


682
0:30:39,77 --> 0:30:43,2
you've got 10 people with 10
connections, you get 100 times


683
0:30:43,2 --> 0:30:44,65
of capacity.


684
0:30:44,65 --> 0:30:50,8
But basically, if you have a lot
of DSL wires, you share them,


685
0:30:50,8 --> 0:30:51,62
you get disproportional
improvement.


686
0:30:51,62 --> 0:30:55,59
It's like a one-lane highway
will get more than three


687
0:30:55,59 --> 0:30:58,27
times the traffic jams
of a three-lane highway.


688
0:30:58,27 --> 0:31:0,96
Because you start to use
the resource effectively.


689
0:31:0,96 --> 0:31:3,71
You fill in the holes,
you accept delays.


690
0:31:3,71 --> 0:31:5,52
And it all depends
on the application.


691
0:31:5,52 --> 0:31:7,186
We're just extending
the word Wikipedia.


692
0:31:7,186 --> 0:31:8,68
Who cares?


693
0:31:8,68 --> 0:31:9,817
A gigabit is wonderful.


694
0:31:9,817 --> 0:31:11,15
Even if you've got a 10 megabit.


695
0:31:11,15 --> 0:31:11,89
Let me share.


696
0:31:11,89 --> 0:31:13,28
Let me decide.


697
0:31:13,28 --> 0:31:14,98
But it affects the
business model.


698
0:31:14,98 --> 0:31:17,47
That's why I keep coming
back to the funding model.


699
0:31:17,47 --> 0:31:19,61
I'm not saying it
should be given away,


700
0:31:19,61 --> 0:31:23,816
we need funding models that
work with societal needs.


701
0:31:23,816 --> 0:31:24,315
Yes.


702
0:31:24,315 --> 0:31:25,689
AUDIENCE: My one
big sticky thing


703
0:31:25,689 --> 0:31:31,56
here still is legal issues,
including intellectual property


704
0:31:31,56 --> 0:31:32,6
enforcement.


705
0:31:32,6 --> 0:31:32,81
BOB FRANKSTON: No.


706
0:31:32,81 --> 0:31:33,95
But that's not in the wire.


707
0:31:33,95 --> 0:31:35,25
The bits are bits.


708
0:31:35,25 --> 0:31:37,77
They have no inherent meaning.


709
0:31:37,77 --> 0:31:40,22
This is a homeopathic
theory of communications,


710
0:31:40,22 --> 0:31:42,77
that bits have a memory
of their original intent.


711
0:31:42,77 --> 0:31:44,704
AUDIENCE: We share
a network connection


712
0:31:44,704 --> 0:31:47,4
that [INAUDIBLE]
multi-family home.


713
0:31:47,4 --> 0:31:49,5
And one person who was
visiting downloaded--


714
0:31:49,5 --> 0:31:50,49
BOB FRANKSTON: Yes.


715
0:31:50,49 --> 0:31:53,27
And this is why lawyers
are one of the greatest


716
0:31:53,27 --> 0:31:54,79
threats to society.


717
0:31:54,79 --> 0:31:57,13
Basically, you
should move the trial


718
0:31:57,13 --> 0:31:59,62
to Salem, which is
the appropriate venue


719
0:31:59,62 --> 0:32:1,832
for such theories.


720
0:32:1,832 --> 0:32:4,73
AUDIENCE: My point is, we
do need, as a society, to--


721
0:32:4,73 --> 0:32:6,44
BOB FRANKSTON: No.


722
0:32:6,44 --> 0:32:10,456
We have to come to the 20th
century, let alone the 21st.


723
0:32:10,456 --> 0:32:12,664
AUDIENCE: But isn't the
fundamental problem referring


724
0:32:12,664 --> 0:32:17,83
to the fact that you're trying
to share the resource that


725
0:32:17,83 --> 0:32:20,4
has a huge level of [INAUDIBLE]?


726
0:32:20,4 --> 0:32:20,79
BOB FRANKSTON: OK.


727
0:32:20,79 --> 0:32:22,255



728
0:32:22,255 --> 0:32:24,38
Let me get through this
and I'll get to this other.


729
0:32:24,38 --> 0:32:29,805
The short answer is we're using
0% of the available capacity.


730
0:32:29,805 --> 0:32:31,805
So before you start telling
me about a shortage,


731
0:32:31,805 --> 0:32:34,3
start telling me where
that shortage is.


732
0:32:34,3 --> 0:32:37,2
When I've got three broadbands
coming through my backyard


733
0:32:37,2 --> 0:32:41,43
and 1% of any one of them is
my full internet connection,


734
0:32:41,43 --> 0:32:44,377
I've already got 100,000
times the capacity.


735
0:32:44,377 --> 0:32:45,21
So what do you mean?


736
0:32:45,21 --> 0:32:47,51
Why do you tell me shortage?


737
0:32:47,51 --> 0:32:48,75
Where's the shortage?


738
0:32:48,75 --> 0:32:53,47
When the police will run a
fiber to their gun detection


739
0:32:53,47 --> 0:32:57,5
sound thing, which only a few
kilobits you need for gunshot,


740
0:32:57,5 --> 0:33:0,1
but deny anybody the
ability to share that.


741
0:33:0,1 --> 0:33:4,47
People now run fibers to
fire alarms and things.


742
0:33:4,47 --> 0:33:6,85
That are terabits of
capacity going unused.


743
0:33:6,85 --> 0:33:8,42
So before you run
about scarcity,


744
0:33:8,42 --> 0:33:9,54
show me there's a problem.


745
0:33:9,54 --> 0:33:12,47



746
0:33:12,47 --> 0:33:15,58
And the other example I won't
get into is meter reading.


747
0:33:15,58 --> 0:33:17,76
Now meter bits are special.


748
0:33:17,76 --> 0:33:19,35
They can't go over
the real internet.


749
0:33:19,35 --> 0:33:22,41
They need their own network
so the phone companies


750
0:33:22,41 --> 0:33:25,11
can go back to triple-play
and collect money


751
0:33:25,11 --> 0:33:26,45
for each meter read.


752
0:33:26,45 --> 0:33:29,565
And if you read the IEEE
numbers about how many gigabits


753
0:33:29,565 --> 0:33:32,896
of capacity and everything
they need to read the meter,


754
0:33:32,896 --> 0:33:34,52
they need a whole
fiber infrastructure,


755
0:33:34,52 --> 0:33:36,164
gigabits capacity.


756
0:33:36,164 --> 0:33:38,8
Though if you run the
numbers, you'll find out


757
0:33:38,8 --> 0:33:40,32
it's less than a bit per second.


758
0:33:40,32 --> 0:33:42,52
But you need fiber.


759
0:33:42,52 --> 0:33:45,9
We're really beholden
to all these myths.


760
0:33:45,9 --> 0:33:47,59
So we need to start
from the edge.


761
0:33:47,59 --> 0:33:50,47
And the other important
point is local connectivity


762
0:33:50,47 --> 0:33:53,1
is more important than
distant connectivity.


763
0:33:53,1 --> 0:33:55,96
We became fixated
on long distance.


764
0:33:55,96 --> 0:33:58,4
Anybody old enough to remember
when long distance would


765
0:33:58,4 --> 0:34:1,77
put fear in your hearts you'd
go bankrupt on a long distance


766
0:34:1,77 --> 0:34:2,73
call?


767
0:34:2,73 --> 0:34:6,7
That's because of the stupid
thing with analog telephony


768
0:34:6,7 --> 0:34:9,199
that Al Bell did.


769
0:34:9,199 --> 0:34:11,92
With digital it's
no longer an issue.


770
0:34:11,92 --> 0:34:13,3
And even more important,
the people we know and stuff


771
0:34:13,3 --> 0:34:15,12
are nearby.


772
0:34:15,12 --> 0:34:16,48
I was reminded of this.


773
0:34:16,48 --> 0:34:19,8
We're so hung up on
social media, the network.


774
0:34:19,8 --> 0:34:21,969
My son last night was
caught-- foolishly


775
0:34:21,969 --> 0:34:25,67
decided to take a
long drive to Phoenix.


776
0:34:25,67 --> 0:34:27,57
And he was going to
go from Indianapolis,


777
0:34:27,57 --> 0:34:31,5
or he was going from
Indianapolis to St. Louis.


778
0:34:31,5 --> 0:34:34,63
It turns out that
outside Terra Haute,


779
0:34:34,63 --> 0:34:39,53
traffic was stopped for 12
hours in the middle of the snow.


780
0:34:39,53 --> 0:34:42,949
Online social media
is no information.


781
0:34:42,949 --> 0:34:46,334
If he had CB radio with him,
and they almost took one,


782
0:34:46,334 --> 0:34:48,75
he could've found out from the
truckers and everybody what


783
0:34:48,75 --> 0:34:49,666
was happening locally.


784
0:34:49,666 --> 0:34:52,7



785
0:34:52,7 --> 0:34:57,78
And so you can get
across the country easily


786
0:34:57,78 --> 0:35:0,23
to get to a website,
but you can't


787
0:35:0,23 --> 0:35:3,88
send a message from your light
switch to the light fixture,


788
0:35:3,88 --> 0:35:6,67
because that's still
using technology


789
0:35:6,67 --> 0:35:8,2
Ben Franklin understood.


790
0:35:8,2 --> 0:35:11,69



791
0:35:11,69 --> 0:35:13,74
We have TV controllers.


792
0:35:13,74 --> 0:35:15,832
There are so many
problems with you


793
0:35:15,832 --> 0:35:17,29
have to be on the
right LAN, you've


794
0:35:17,29 --> 0:35:19,704
got to point the IR
at the right device.


795
0:35:19,704 --> 0:35:21,12
We do all this
work at a distance,


796
0:35:21,12 --> 0:35:24,855
yet we don't realize
it starts locally.


797
0:35:24,855 --> 0:35:27,33
And then interconnect
these local islands


798
0:35:27,33 --> 0:35:29,17
is how the internet happened.


799
0:35:29,17 --> 0:35:32,59
And that's important
lesson I built on.


800
0:35:32,59 --> 0:35:34,14
Actually, we're going to finish.


801
0:35:34,14 --> 0:35:38,25
So what I did with home
networking is I made it opaque.


802
0:35:38,25 --> 0:35:40,297
I was at Microsoft at the time.


803
0:35:40,297 --> 0:35:41,88
Basically I prototyped
it at my house.


804
0:35:41,88 --> 0:35:43,87
I did it for myself.


805
0:35:43,87 --> 0:35:44,92
And I try to do things
that are generalized.


806
0:35:44,92 --> 0:35:46,378
When Dan Bricklin
did a spreadsheet


807
0:35:46,378 --> 0:35:48,7
so he could do his
homework, we just


808
0:35:48,7 --> 0:35:49,31
did a general version of it.


809
0:35:49,31 --> 0:35:53,34



810
0:35:53,34 --> 0:35:55,3
So the NAT is a nice hack.


811
0:35:55,3 --> 0:35:57,219
So people couldn't
peek inside your house.


812
0:35:57,219 --> 0:35:59,1
They couldn't enforce
the terms of service.


813
0:35:59,1 --> 0:36:1,159
You could share all you want.


814
0:36:1,159 --> 0:36:3,7
On occasion they'll try to tell
you, and the problem is yeah,


815
0:36:3,7 --> 0:36:5,22
some people look
at the IP address


816
0:36:5,22 --> 0:36:9,116
and all sorts of how bad ideas.


817
0:36:9,116 --> 0:36:10,99
Accuse you of being a
witch because your bits


818
0:36:10,99 --> 0:36:13,192
don't look right.


819
0:36:13,192 --> 0:36:15,4
But the key is to make it
just so you can give people


820
0:36:15,4 --> 0:36:18,2
the tools to use the
resources available.


821
0:36:18,2 --> 0:36:21,89
How many people worry about
how many gigabits of video


822
0:36:21,89 --> 0:36:25,41
they're showing
within their home?


823
0:36:25,41 --> 0:36:26,4
There's no cost.


824
0:36:26,4 --> 0:36:30,11
It suddenly becomes expensive
once you get outside the home.


825
0:36:30,11 --> 0:36:32,79
So the benefits to the ownership
is you get as many IP devices


826
0:36:32,79 --> 0:36:33,65
as you want.


827
0:36:33,65 --> 0:36:38,11
There's not scarcity of IP
addresses, no meter running.


828
0:36:38,11 --> 0:36:40,26
And right now we ca run
gigabits in the home.


829
0:36:40,26 --> 0:36:43,13
Remember it used to be ten
megabits was very expensive.


830
0:36:43,13 --> 0:36:46,28
Modems used to be
$300 for kilobits.


831
0:36:46,28 --> 0:36:47,43
But we're not quite there.


832
0:36:47,43 --> 0:36:50,82
We still have this perimeter
security, these complex rules.


833
0:36:50,82 --> 0:36:53,574
Instead of abstracting security,
making the application.


834
0:36:53,574 --> 0:36:55,49
We still think it's a
property of the network.


835
0:36:55,49 --> 0:36:58,42
And these all long discussions
in their own right.


836
0:36:58,42 --> 0:37:1,21
And we still don't
understand generic bits.


837
0:37:1,21 --> 0:37:5,61
We have USB, we have SATA we
have FireWire, we have HDMI.


838
0:37:5,61 --> 0:37:8,595
All these special packets,
as if they're are all


839
0:37:8,595 --> 0:37:11,197
so special and different.


840
0:37:11,197 --> 0:37:13,28
I did this display port
here because that's really


841
0:37:13,28 --> 0:37:15,45
an application protocol
which we should be pushing,


842
0:37:15,45 --> 0:37:17,73
but instead we're
stuck with HDMI,


843
0:37:17,73 --> 0:37:20,82
which is equivalent to
the old digital telephone.


844
0:37:20,82 --> 0:37:23,36
Sort of faux digital.


845
0:37:23,36 --> 0:37:27,8
So with home control
we can learn by doing.


846
0:37:27,8 --> 0:37:31,97
But people still
think it's special


847
0:37:31,97 --> 0:37:33,85
because it's within a home.


848
0:37:33,85 --> 0:37:35,93
It's behind a NAT.


849
0:37:35,93 --> 0:37:40,75
When it's really just the
example of a do it yourself


850
0:37:40,75 --> 0:37:42,7
environment.


851
0:37:42,7 --> 0:37:44,91
We have discovered,
for example, want


852
0:37:44,91 --> 0:37:47,86
to solve a problem
connecting devices?


853
0:37:47,86 --> 0:37:52,38
One thing from the edge is, v6
is a dead issue at this point.


854
0:37:52,38 --> 0:37:55,83
Instead we use v4
reflected to the cloud.


855
0:37:55,83 --> 0:37:58,0
Which I think is a terrible
idea, but it works.


856
0:37:58,0 --> 0:38:0,85
It's an example of you
go with what works.


857
0:38:0,85 --> 0:38:2,832



858
0:38:2,832 --> 0:38:4,4
But I won't dwell
on that either.


859
0:38:4,4 --> 0:38:7,32
Another topic.


860
0:38:7,32 --> 0:38:8,99
But we still use wires
to define relationships.


861
0:38:8,99 --> 0:38:11,3
So how do we move
beyond the home?


862
0:38:11,3 --> 0:38:13,71



863
0:38:13,71 --> 0:38:15,2
The answer's very simple.


864
0:38:15,2 --> 0:38:16,895
We do what we did with
the original internet.


865
0:38:16,895 --> 0:38:18,926



866
0:38:18,926 --> 0:38:20,55
We basically interconnect
this islands.


867
0:38:20,55 --> 0:38:22,8
We've already tunneled
between the islands.


868
0:38:22,8 --> 0:38:25,88
When you get a quote,
"broadband connection",


869
0:38:25,88 --> 0:38:29,99
you're really tunneling out
of your home through telecom.


870
0:38:29,99 --> 0:38:30,64
They own the other
end of the tunnel,


871
0:38:30,64 --> 0:38:32,81
but that's a temporary
historical accident.


872
0:38:32,81 --> 0:38:34,71
We won't go into
why it happened.


873
0:38:34,71 --> 0:38:37,65
But we can take the
same ownership perimeter


874
0:38:37,65 --> 0:38:40,29
and expand it out
from your home.


875
0:38:40,29 --> 0:38:41,99
So if you and your
neighbors share,


876
0:38:41,99 --> 0:38:45,93
which some people are already
doing, an apartment house,


877
0:38:45,93 --> 0:38:47,63
you can get many benefits.


878
0:38:47,63 --> 0:38:49,5
To get two major benefits.


879
0:38:49,5 --> 0:38:50,54
One is cost savings.


880
0:38:50,54 --> 0:38:52,23
You share the capacity.


881
0:38:52,23 --> 0:38:55,97
But the other thing is you
can get permissionless ambient


882
0:38:55,97 --> 0:38:56,94
connectivity.


883
0:38:56,94 --> 0:38:59,49
You can now do all
those IP-based devices.


884
0:38:59,49 --> 0:39:2,7
You can buy some now, but the
problem with perimeter security


885
0:39:2,7 --> 0:39:5,814
makes them very
brittle and fragile.


886
0:39:5,814 --> 0:39:7,73
AUDIENCE: It depends on
what the perimeter is.


887
0:39:7,73 --> 0:39:10,14
In our building we
run our own services.


888
0:39:10,14 --> 0:39:13,67
BOB FRANKSTON: Yeah,
But do you have


889
0:39:13,67 --> 0:39:14,956
a WEP or other authentication?


890
0:39:14,956 --> 0:39:17,96



891
0:39:17,96 --> 0:39:19,48
AUDIENCE: It's
been years since I


892
0:39:19,48 --> 0:39:20,45
was using any of those services.


893
0:39:20,45 --> 0:39:21,81
BOB FRANKSTON: No,
but the answers is--


894
0:39:21,81 --> 0:39:23,435
AUDIENCE: A server
you can [INAUDIBLE].


895
0:39:23,435 --> 0:39:24,747
BOB FRANKSTON: Right.


896
0:39:24,747 --> 0:39:26,33
You have that, but
what you want to do


897
0:39:26,33 --> 0:39:28,44
is at least be able to
have devices just connect.


898
0:39:28,44 --> 0:39:32,32
I'm glad to see Google does
not have an agree screen.


899
0:39:32,32 --> 0:39:37,6
But the problem is you get
things like this at Jet Blue.


900
0:39:37,6 --> 0:39:40,237
Now can somebody
explain why first I


901
0:39:40,237 --> 0:39:43,55
have to call my lawyer
before I can call my lawyer?


902
0:39:43,55 --> 0:39:46,68



903
0:39:46,68 --> 0:39:48,2
There's something wrong there.


904
0:39:48,2 --> 0:39:49,59
I've already the
airline terminal.


905
0:39:49,59 --> 0:39:53,2
I've already agreed to much
worse things they could do me,


906
0:39:53,2 --> 0:39:55,85
yet they have me type agree.


907
0:39:55,85 --> 0:39:57,71
This is something
everybody should


908
0:39:57,71 --> 0:39:59,285
do what they can to
get rid of those.


909
0:39:59,285 --> 0:40:2,25



910
0:40:2,25 --> 0:40:4,3
And again, if you
ask people fear,


911
0:40:4,3 --> 0:40:5,28
they'll say child pornography.


912
0:40:5,28 --> 0:40:8,174



913
0:40:8,174 --> 0:40:9,715
They don't have any
better idea, it's


914
0:40:9,715 --> 0:40:12,826
just they've
learned this mantra.


915
0:40:12,826 --> 0:40:14,2
But if we paid
for infrastructure


916
0:40:14,2 --> 0:40:15,695
like we do roads
and sidewalks, we


917
0:40:15,695 --> 0:40:18,6
wouldn't have a need to shut
things down just for revenue.


918
0:40:18,6 --> 0:40:20,605
AUDIENCE: Will you
accept, especially


919
0:40:20,605 --> 0:40:23,37
in neighborhoods like where
my house is, that there


920
0:40:23,37 --> 0:40:27,371
are thieves, drug dealers,
all sorts of criminals using


921
0:40:27,371 --> 0:40:30,766
those public rights of way
to get by with no record


922
0:40:30,766 --> 0:40:32,64
that they passed because--


923
0:40:32,64 --> 0:40:35,32
BOB FRANKSTON: You mean you
let people walk by your house


924
0:40:35,32 --> 0:40:37,51
without signing an agreement?


925
0:40:37,51 --> 0:40:39,236
And without paying you?


926
0:40:39,236 --> 0:40:39,86
AUDIENCE: Yeah.


927
0:40:39,86 --> 0:40:41,964
Well the ping is a
totally different issue.


928
0:40:41,964 --> 0:40:43,38
BOB FRANKSTON:
Well ask Rand Paul.


929
0:40:43,38 --> 0:40:44,232
He'd demand--


930
0:40:44,232 --> 0:40:46,19
AUDIENCE: You have a very
different expectation


931
0:40:46,19 --> 0:40:50,1
of how freely usable for
potentially illegal activities


932
0:40:50,1 --> 0:40:52,88
a sidewalk is, compared to--


933
0:40:52,88 --> 0:40:56,6



934
0:40:56,6 --> 0:40:57,81
BOB FRANKSTON: And
this is what's amazing.


935
0:40:57,81 --> 0:41:1,37
We're lucky by accident
in the Constitution days


936
0:41:1,37 --> 0:41:3,72
when people were really
pissed off at the king,


937
0:41:3,72 --> 0:41:5,98
so they wrote the
free speech thing in.


938
0:41:5,98 --> 0:41:13,44
But every opportunity since, the
fear is so-- it's spelled NSA.


939
0:41:13,44 --> 0:41:20,2
And yes, it's amazing
how people fear


940
0:41:20,2 --> 0:41:21,477
what they don't understand yet.


941
0:41:21,477 --> 0:41:23,81
Which means you're not going
to get any discontinuities,


942
0:41:23,81 --> 0:41:25,559
and you're not going
to get any surprises.


943
0:41:25,559 --> 0:41:26,77
Yes.


944
0:41:26,77 --> 0:41:29,33
But an important part
of the whole lecture,


945
0:41:29,33 --> 0:41:32,8
why the First Amendment works.


946
0:41:32,8 --> 0:41:36,78
Why things work despite the
fact that crossing a street


947
0:41:36,78 --> 0:41:38,4
is too dangerous to do.


948
0:41:38,4 --> 0:41:42,64



949
0:41:42,64 --> 0:41:45,4
So if we fund the
infrastructure-- again,


950
0:41:45,4 --> 0:41:48,53
as I keep saying-- as you do
sidewalks, these problems go.


951
0:41:48,53 --> 0:41:52,0
The reason for putting up
a wall, putting fear aside,


952
0:41:52,0 --> 0:41:53,9
financial reasons go away.


953
0:41:53,9 --> 0:41:56,16
Because it's so cheap,
you pay for it once


954
0:41:56,16 --> 0:41:57,72
like a home network.


955
0:41:57,72 --> 0:42:0,56
And then you create opportunity
to discover [INAUDIBLE].


956
0:42:0,56 --> 0:42:4,9
We haven't even started
to explore what we can do.


957
0:42:4,9 --> 0:42:6,65
Because we can do high
value applications.


958
0:42:6,65 --> 0:42:7,63
Like at home control.


959
0:42:7,63 --> 0:42:14,74



960
0:42:14,74 --> 0:42:16,92
I don't know where my
slide is, but home control


961
0:42:16,92 --> 0:42:19,26
is a wonderful example,
because we just


962
0:42:19,26 --> 0:42:22,9
start to discover what we
can do with connectivity.


963
0:42:22,9 --> 0:42:25,29
But one of the lessons I
learned to total control


964
0:42:25,29 --> 0:42:27,55
is that we could do
high value applications.


965
0:42:27,55 --> 0:42:29,926
We call them trophy homes.


966
0:42:29,926 --> 0:42:31,55
There are lighting
scenarios, all these


967
0:42:31,55 --> 0:42:33,4
complicated high value stories.


968
0:42:33,4 --> 0:42:36,1
TVs coming down, the
shades, all this stuff.


969
0:42:36,1 --> 0:42:38,34
We can't do light switches.


970
0:42:38,34 --> 0:42:39,31
OK?


971
0:42:39,31 --> 0:42:41,61
That's the problem here.


972
0:42:41,61 --> 0:42:43,69
Without permissionless
ambient connectivity,


973
0:42:43,69 --> 0:42:44,822
simple things become hard.


974
0:42:44,822 --> 0:42:46,3
It's not just permissionless.


975
0:42:46,3 --> 0:42:50,33
The DNS, the current-- you
must ask ICANN for permission.


976
0:42:50,33 --> 0:42:51,78
There are lots of
other problems,


977
0:42:51,78 --> 0:42:54,35
but if we solve the
financial problems,


978
0:42:54,35 --> 0:42:56,296
we then have an incentive
to solve problems.


979
0:42:56,296 --> 0:42:57,795
We introduce
resilience to the edge.


980
0:42:57,795 --> 0:43:0,17
You connect through
an access point.


981
0:43:0,17 --> 0:43:1,6
You're walking down
the street, you've


982
0:43:1,6 --> 0:43:4,58
got Comcast and all these
others connected to,


983
0:43:4,58 --> 0:43:6,93
and then Google
Maps stops working.


984
0:43:6,93 --> 0:43:8,84
Because one access
point got stuck.


985
0:43:8,84 --> 0:43:10,79
Authentication chain,
somebody broke it.


986
0:43:10,79 --> 0:43:13,56
The protocols of the
edge aren't resilient.


987
0:43:13,56 --> 0:43:16,46
So there's a lot of work
to do better protocols


988
0:43:16,46 --> 0:43:18,25
and have resilience
of the whole network.


989
0:43:18,25 --> 0:43:19,22
Not meshy, necessarily.


990
0:43:19,22 --> 0:43:20,22
That's just technology.


991
0:43:20,22 --> 0:43:21,94
But resilience.


992
0:43:21,94 --> 0:43:24,455
So the old model,
we assume value


993
0:43:24,455 --> 0:43:27,36
is created inside the network.


994
0:43:27,36 --> 0:43:30,98
Thus we could fund the
network out of the revenue.


995
0:43:30,98 --> 0:43:33,83
And that's where the
cable TV companies are.


996
0:43:33,83 --> 0:43:35,65
They own the pipes,
they sell resources,


997
0:43:35,65 --> 0:43:38,0
just like railroads sold rides.


998
0:43:38,0 --> 0:43:40,23
If you go to Netflix
that collapses,


999
0:43:40,23 --> 0:43:41,73
which creates the conflict.


1000
0:43:41,73 --> 0:43:44,37
Fortunately there's
a new business model,


1001
0:43:44,37 --> 0:43:46,16
which is the one I keep saying.


1002
0:43:46,16 --> 0:43:47,44
Just pay for the wires.


1003
0:43:47,44 --> 0:43:48,24
They're so cheap.


1004
0:43:48,24 --> 0:43:50,66
You put them in once.


1005
0:43:50,66 --> 0:43:52,33
It's amazing how inexpensive.


1006
0:43:52,33 --> 0:43:56,8
And if we didn't
put the fiber in,


1007
0:43:56,8 --> 0:43:58,69
we would have been doing
gigabits over copper.


1008
0:43:58,69 --> 0:44:2,99
DSL was running
megabits 25 years ago.


1009
0:44:2,99 --> 0:44:4,97
Now it's copper,
right, so not pairs.


1010
0:44:4,97 --> 0:44:7,25
You don't follow DSL rules.


1011
0:44:7,25 --> 0:44:9,83
You be very innovative, you
do the bundles as a whole.


1012
0:44:9,83 --> 0:44:15,48
And at this point, one way
to use copper is to sell it.


1013
0:44:15,48 --> 0:44:16,84
Less copper and buy fiber.


1014
0:44:16,84 --> 0:44:18,56
I don't care.


1015
0:44:18,56 --> 0:44:22,77
I'm just saying the economics
is what drives Moore's law.


1016
0:44:22,77 --> 0:44:26,29
And then we won't have the need
to exclude people for no reason


1017
0:44:26,29 --> 0:44:29,449
other than forcing
people to pay.


1018
0:44:29,449 --> 0:44:31,24
Imagine sidewalks, the
paywall around them.


1019
0:44:31,24 --> 0:44:33,784



1020
0:44:33,784 --> 0:44:36,2
To show you the value of this,
let's look at a case study.


1021
0:44:36,2 --> 0:44:39,5
Philips Lifeline is one of
the local companies there now


1022
0:44:39,5 --> 0:44:40,12
in Framingham.


1023
0:44:40,12 --> 0:44:42,56
They started locally.


1024
0:44:42,56 --> 0:44:46,31
And initially they
just had the radio


1025
0:44:46,31 --> 0:44:50,5
from the device going to a
phone and it would dial up.


1026
0:44:50,5 --> 0:44:52,984
It worked well enough
for the purpose.


1027
0:44:52,984 --> 0:44:54,65
Hopefully the phone
line was not in use,


1028
0:44:54,65 --> 0:44:55,27
and all the other things.


1029
0:44:55,27 --> 0:44:56,728
But they put it
before, and you can


1030
0:44:56,728 --> 0:44:59,55
get it to work enough
times to be useful.


1031
0:44:59,55 --> 0:45:3,3
Now people are going to the
next stage, which they carefully


1032
0:45:3,3 --> 0:45:5,35
set up connections
to cell phone.


1033
0:45:5,35 --> 0:45:7,995
If you set up the Bluetooth
right and use the right


1034
0:45:7,995 --> 0:45:10,62
phone, and you've paid your
bill, and the matter of--


1035
0:45:10,62 --> 0:45:12,72
and you [MUMBLING].


1036
0:45:12,72 --> 0:45:15,67
It can work.


1037
0:45:15,67 --> 0:45:17,88
But the problem without
permissionless ambient


1038
0:45:17,88 --> 0:45:22,3
connectivity is the
default is failure.


1039
0:45:22,3 --> 0:45:25,12
Shouldn't the default
be to just work?


1040
0:45:25,12 --> 0:45:27,2
And that's really
what I'm getting to.


1041
0:45:27,2 --> 0:45:29,239
The idea that we want
just works connectivity.


1042
0:45:29,239 --> 0:45:30,78
Now there are no
guarantees, and this


1043
0:45:30,78 --> 0:45:32,67
is why the VoIP
story is important.


1044
0:45:32,67 --> 0:45:34,31
Because we can
get voice to work.


1045
0:45:34,31 --> 0:45:37,36
It turns out Skype works
much better over lines


1046
0:45:37,36 --> 0:45:39,11
that the traditional
phone companies can't


1047
0:45:39,11 --> 0:45:41,8
use because their
protocols are all


1048
0:45:41,8 --> 0:45:44,53
brittly dependent upon the
network doing everything right,


1049
0:45:44,53 --> 0:45:45,91
preserving a path.


1050
0:45:45,91 --> 0:45:49,81
Turns out cleverness
can make up for a lot.


1051
0:45:49,81 --> 0:45:51,904
So this is why so important
are the incentives


1052
0:45:51,904 --> 0:45:52,945
and create opportunities.


1053
0:45:52,945 --> 0:45:55,471



1054
0:45:55,471 --> 0:45:57,22
And then there's a
whole discussion, which


1055
0:45:57,22 --> 0:45:59,3
I won't get into,
is then we can start


1056
0:45:59,3 --> 0:46:0,81
rethinking the current internet.


1057
0:46:0,81 --> 0:46:2,601
For example, the Post
Office, I understand,


1058
0:46:2,601 --> 0:46:5,262
is routing far better than
any of the internet people.


1059
0:46:5,262 --> 0:46:6,72
Because it try to
send mail to you.


1060
0:46:6,72 --> 0:46:7,92
It sends mail to a place.


1061
0:46:7,92 --> 0:46:9,3
That's its job.


1062
0:46:9,3 --> 0:46:10,56
You tell your friends
where you are.


1063
0:46:10,56 --> 0:46:14,22



1064
0:46:14,22 --> 0:46:16,0
So I can go through,
if anybody wants to,


1065
0:46:16,0 --> 0:46:19,95
the other big topic we could
do is where are the smarts.


1066
0:46:19,95 --> 0:46:21,7
Smarts are valuable.


1067
0:46:21,7 --> 0:46:23,111
So people want to
own the smarts.


1068
0:46:23,111 --> 0:46:24,61
But if you go into
a restaurant, you


1069
0:46:24,61 --> 0:46:27,189
don't want your
wait person knowing


1070
0:46:27,189 --> 0:46:28,23
what you're going to eat.


1071
0:46:28,23 --> 0:46:32,12
You'd like to have
some say in the matter.


1072
0:46:32,12 --> 0:46:35,14
So I won't go into
the challenges,


1073
0:46:35,14 --> 0:46:39,45
but obviously there's a
telecom industry which exists


1074
0:46:39,45 --> 0:46:42,7
and to rightfully sees
this as a deadly threat.


1075
0:46:42,7 --> 0:46:46,92
We have an FCC, which is
trying to transition to IP, as


1076
0:46:46,92 --> 0:46:50,69
if they're desperate attempt
to keep us in stage two.


1077
0:46:50,69 --> 0:46:53,61
By simply saying IP
is the new phone wire,


1078
0:46:53,61 --> 0:46:55,666
but everything else is the same.


1079
0:46:55,666 --> 0:46:57,51
You don't transition.


1080
0:46:57,51 --> 0:46:59,94
You let the whole thing
fade into the sunset.


1081
0:46:59,94 --> 0:47:2,28
At some point nobody's
going to care about it.


1082
0:47:2,28 --> 0:47:4,87
You resell the facilities.


1083
0:47:4,87 --> 0:47:7,2
And want does one do
with lead acid batteries?


1084
0:47:7,2 --> 0:47:8,55
How do you decommission them?


1085
0:47:8,55 --> 0:47:9,8
There might be a lot of money.


1086
0:47:9,8 --> 0:47:12,13
Somebody find a good use
for lead acid batteries.


1087
0:47:12,13 --> 0:47:15,415
You'd make a lot of money.


1088
0:47:15,415 --> 0:47:17,4
AUDIENCE: They recycle
them, I thought.


1089
0:47:17,4 --> 0:47:17,998
BOB FRANKSTON: As what?


1090
0:47:17,998 --> 0:47:19,94
Maybe they do, but
I'm just saying.


1091
0:47:19,94 --> 0:47:23,74
The whole internet thing
is just in the infancy.


1092
0:47:23,74 --> 0:47:26,39
Everything I read about
it is very special hacks.


1093
0:47:26,39 --> 0:47:27,87
There's no general connectivity.


1094
0:47:27,87 --> 0:47:29,905
But then again, these
long discussions-- I


1095
0:47:29,905 --> 0:47:34,532
just wanted to introduce
these as ideas at this point.


1096
0:47:34,532 --> 0:47:36,49
I can also, if you want,
go to the other slide,


1097
0:47:36,49 --> 0:47:38,823
which I'm proud of, is how
do we run out of the internet


1098
0:47:38,823 --> 0:47:40,965
when it's just a technique?


1099
0:47:40,965 --> 0:47:45,8
After hacking at night
here, went to Union Square


1100
0:47:45,8 --> 0:47:47,65
for French toast.


1101
0:47:47,65 --> 0:47:51,455
And I was told we're
out of a French toast.


1102
0:47:51,455 --> 0:47:54,134



1103
0:47:54,134 --> 0:47:56,5
We asked, said are you
out of bread, milk too?


1104
0:47:56,5 --> 0:47:58,32
He said the guy didn't
know how to make it.


1105
0:47:58,32 --> 0:48:0,13
And that's really
those wires are,


1106
0:48:0,13 --> 0:48:1,89
is running out of internet.


1107
0:48:1,89 --> 0:48:3,3
So any questions?


1108
0:48:3,3 --> 0:48:4,3
Anybody confused?


1109
0:48:4,3 --> 0:48:4,98
Anybody awake?


1110
0:48:4,98 --> 0:48:8,82



1111
0:48:8,82 --> 0:48:11,97
AUDIENCE: So what happens
to your do it yourself


1112
0:48:11,97 --> 0:48:15,97
home small community
network when it breaks?


1113
0:48:15,97 --> 0:48:19,303
BOB FRANKSTON: What happens
if your water pipe breaks?


1114
0:48:19,303 --> 0:48:20,719
AUDIENCE: Well, I
get it serviced.


1115
0:48:20,719 --> 0:48:21,552
BOB FRANKSTON: Yeah.


1116
0:48:21,552 --> 0:48:22,92
So we'll have the new plumbers.


1117
0:48:22,92 --> 0:48:24,586
And in fact, I'm
actually trying to find


1118
0:48:24,586 --> 0:48:25,85
people who want to start.


1119
0:48:25,85 --> 0:48:27,35
In other words, the
point I'm making


1120
0:48:27,35 --> 0:48:29,9
is I'm actually in favor
of business, capitalists,


1121
0:48:29,9 --> 0:48:30,98
and all this.


1122
0:48:30,98 --> 0:48:33,13
It's just you've got to
have rational businesses,


1123
0:48:33,13 --> 0:48:35,46
and the model changes.


1124
0:48:35,46 --> 0:48:41,35
If you want to read a book
"Railroaded", by Richard White.


1125
0:48:41,35 --> 0:48:42,94
It's a wonderful
story because it


1126
0:48:42,94 --> 0:48:45,966
tells how the railroads in
the West-- this is opposed


1127
0:48:45,966 --> 0:48:48,34
to the ones in the East, which
have different densities--


1128
0:48:48,34 --> 0:48:50,77
were never financially viable.


1129
0:48:50,77 --> 0:48:53,22
That's why you've got the FCC.


1130
0:48:53,22 --> 0:48:55,93
Or subways in New York
were never viable.


1131
0:48:55,93 --> 0:49:0,13
Each infrastructure, you have to
look at how these centers work,


1132
0:49:0,13 --> 0:49:1,35
what's the business model?


1133
0:49:1,35 --> 0:49:3,36
Instead of just
continuing forward.


1134
0:49:3,36 --> 0:49:5,99
So yes, if we're viewing
a time and materials


1135
0:49:5,99 --> 0:49:8,862
model as a business,
we need plumbers.


1136
0:49:8,862 --> 0:49:10,82
Of course they're a time
and material business.


1137
0:49:10,82 --> 0:49:14,79
Your plumber does not charge
you for the cost of water


1138
0:49:14,79 --> 0:49:16,65
at the price of whisky.


1139
0:49:16,65 --> 0:49:20,2
When you buy flour you
don't pay for the cake.


1140
0:49:20,2 --> 0:49:22,467
So you have to understand
where the values is added.


1141
0:49:22,467 --> 0:49:23,3
Question back there?


1142
0:49:23,3 --> 0:49:26,41



1143
0:49:26,41 --> 0:49:28,79
The first step, one thing to
do, and people are already


1144
0:49:28,79 --> 0:49:33,46
doing it, the first step is
education and understanding.


1145
0:49:33,46 --> 0:49:35,1
But if you're in
an apartment house,


1146
0:49:35,1 --> 0:49:37,43
get your friends and
neighbors to basically make


1147
0:49:37,43 --> 0:49:39,21
that a connected zone.


1148
0:49:39,21 --> 0:49:41,9
Because petitioning
the city is hard,


1149
0:49:41,9 --> 0:49:43,4
because there's too much
education, the language,


1150
0:49:43,4 --> 0:49:44,65
everything makes it very hard.


1151
0:49:44,65 --> 0:49:47,49
How can you even
talk about the FCC


1152
0:49:47,49 --> 0:49:52,48
when they were created to
keep a business model alive?


1153
0:49:52,48 --> 0:49:55,34
They're not a technology
They were designed


1154
0:49:55,34 --> 0:49:58,53
as part of a deal
with AT&T to make


1155
0:49:58,53 --> 0:50:3,93
AT&T viable as the stewards
of our ability to communicate.


1156
0:50:3,93 --> 0:50:6,5
Things have sort of
gotten out of whack.


1157
0:50:6,5 --> 0:50:7,95
And they also got
a right to do it


1158
0:50:7,95 --> 0:50:10,44
based on spectrum allocation.


1159
0:50:10,44 --> 0:50:11,9
But you understand
how hard it is


1160
0:50:11,9 --> 0:50:13,358
to get people to
think differently,


1161
0:50:13,358 --> 0:50:16,1
but if you change economics,
if your building--


1162
0:50:16,1 --> 0:50:17,71
and there are a
million buildings-- so


1163
0:50:17,71 --> 0:50:19,85
if you start to
get your building


1164
0:50:19,85 --> 0:50:21,37
to be a connected zone,
and work out from there,


1165
0:50:21,37 --> 0:50:23,5
repeating the history
of the internet,


1166
0:50:23,5 --> 0:50:26,795
you start to get to an
alternative which is viable.


1167
0:50:26,795 --> 0:50:29,88



1168
0:50:29,88 --> 0:50:33,364
And I think that's the starting.


1169
0:50:33,364 --> 0:50:37,188
AUDIENCE: When you start to
get, having been involved


1170
0:50:37,188 --> 0:50:39,602
in small building
connectivity zone


1171
0:50:39,602 --> 0:50:42,52
efforts over a couple of
decades, problems you have


1172
0:50:42,52 --> 0:50:45,707
is still, as far as I
know, too much expertise.


1173
0:50:45,707 --> 0:50:46,54
BOB FRANKSTON: Yeah.


1174
0:50:46,54 --> 0:50:48,84
If you want a
problem, it's really


1175
0:50:48,84 --> 0:50:50,64
a problem in California,
the Bay Area.


1176
0:50:50,64 --> 0:50:52,69
Too many people who
understand too much.


1177
0:50:52,69 --> 0:50:56,58
That's my parallel to put
in fiber, ripped out fiber.


1178
0:50:56,58 --> 0:50:57,59
So yes.


1179
0:50:57,59 --> 0:51:1,496
It's a matter of venue
shopping and set example.


1180
0:51:1,496 --> 0:51:4,352
AUDIENCE: But more than this,
plumbing isn't a simple thing.


1181
0:51:4,352 --> 0:51:7,584
But plumbing was simplified so
that it could become a trade.


1182
0:51:7,584 --> 0:51:10,78
And by having it
established as a trade,


1183
0:51:10,78 --> 0:51:12,822
regular people can become
people that maintain plumbing.


1184
0:51:12,822 --> 0:51:14,3
You need that for networking.


1185
0:51:14,3 --> 0:51:15,2
BOB FRANKSTON: Well
actually, remember,


1186
0:51:15,2 --> 0:51:16,741
I did that already
for home networks.


1187
0:51:16,741 --> 0:51:19,116



1188
0:51:19,116 --> 0:51:20,866
When I first started
doing home networking


1189
0:51:20,866 --> 0:51:23,469
in '95, think of
the reaction I got


1190
0:51:23,469 --> 0:51:25,76
when I said people are going
to maintain their own home


1191
0:51:25,76 --> 0:51:28,175
networks.


1192
0:51:28,175 --> 0:51:29,73
So I did a couple things.


1193
0:51:29,73 --> 0:51:34,16
First thing, remember I had this
position having been in a class


1194
0:51:34,16 --> 0:51:35,466
where we were doing this stuff.


1195
0:51:35,466 --> 0:51:37,9
So I knew there was
nothing hard there.


1196
0:51:37,9 --> 0:51:38,194
Nothing secret.


1197
0:51:38,194 --> 0:51:39,86
I just had to remove
all the things that


1198
0:51:39,86 --> 0:51:44,149
made it hard like configuring IP
addresses and things like that.


1199
0:51:44,149 --> 0:51:45,19
I've learned a lot since.


1200
0:51:45,19 --> 0:51:47,99
There's a lot of ways they
can make it even simpler.


1201
0:51:47,99 --> 0:51:48,99
So yes.


1202
0:51:48,99 --> 0:51:52,21
Part of it is this is why I talk
about the connectivity of net


1203
0:51:52,21 --> 0:51:57,15
routing I compare with crossing
a river by jumping on icebergs.


1204
0:51:57,15 --> 0:51:59,39
Turns out we have bridges.


1205
0:51:59,39 --> 0:52:0,63
Just use the bridges.


1206
0:52:0,63 --> 0:52:2,76
It's like the Post Office
delivers to addresses.


1207
0:52:2,76 --> 0:52:5,59
So insights like that
make things much simpler.


1208
0:52:5,59 --> 0:52:9,14
All hubs and routers
should be self-diagnosing.


1209
0:52:9,14 --> 0:52:12,821
But until we have a market
incentive to do this,


1210
0:52:12,821 --> 0:52:14,57
it's going to be hard
to make that happen.


1211
0:52:14,57 --> 0:52:17,36
Unfortunately, I
was at Microsoft.


1212
0:52:17,36 --> 0:52:19,92
I was able to keep
them, and I purposely


1213
0:52:19,92 --> 0:52:23,126
made sure they had no
way to monetize it.


1214
0:52:23,126 --> 0:52:25,34
To control it.


1215
0:52:25,34 --> 0:52:27,304
But they did get value
out of the connectivity.


1216
0:52:27,304 --> 0:52:29,345
Just like Google has a
value out of connectivity.


1217
0:52:29,345 --> 0:52:33,68
The more people can connect--
even if 99% of the traffic


1218
0:52:33,68 --> 0:52:37,54
is local, you can still start
to offer all these new services


1219
0:52:37,54 --> 0:52:39,13
and these new innovations.


1220
0:52:39,13 --> 0:52:40,73
But I am actively
looking for people


1221
0:52:40,73 --> 0:52:44,78
to work with who do want to
do business in both educating


1222
0:52:44,78 --> 0:52:46,62
people on how to
do it themselves


1223
0:52:46,62 --> 0:52:49,92
and providing the
appropriate expertise.


1224
0:52:49,92 --> 0:52:51,1
So yes.


1225
0:52:51,1 --> 0:52:53,96
I don't expect most people to
want to do their own networking


1226
0:52:53,96 --> 0:52:58,7
or build their own networks,
but there's no reason


1227
0:52:58,7 --> 0:53:0,124
that it has to be hard.


1228
0:53:0,124 --> 0:53:1,4
We're just used to it.


1229
0:53:1,4 --> 0:53:2,47
The same as DNS.


1230
0:53:2,47 --> 0:53:4,93
We have this whole
legacy because so much


1231
0:53:4,93 --> 0:53:7,22
of today's internet goes
back to the mainframe


1232
0:53:7,22 --> 0:53:13,4
days, port numbers, all these
issues, which are legacies.


1233
0:53:13,4 --> 0:53:19,88
We've learned a lot since we
first did the current internet.


1234
0:53:19,88 --> 0:53:20,807
Yes.


1235
0:53:20,807 --> 0:53:22,23
AUDIENCE: So, to
[INAUDIBLE] idea


1236
0:53:22,23 --> 0:53:23,729
up, you just have
to make it easier.


1237
0:53:23,729 --> 0:53:27,52
But you mentioned a problem
being firewalls and such.


1238
0:53:27,52 --> 0:53:29,68
BOB FRANKSTON: Yes.


1239
0:53:29,68 --> 0:53:34,32
AUDIENCE: One of the [INAUDIBLE]
benefits of that is I


1240
0:53:34,32 --> 0:53:37,325
think at one time if you
put a Windows computer


1241
0:53:37,325 --> 0:53:40,79
on the public [INAUDIBLE], it
would compromise in 10 minutes.


1242
0:53:40,79 --> 0:53:43,129
Definitely less [INAUDIBLE].


1243
0:53:43,129 --> 0:53:43,92
BOB FRANKSTON: Yes.


1244
0:53:43,92 --> 0:53:47,6
And when I first did it,
what I was saying is OK,


1245
0:53:47,6 --> 0:53:50,33
v4 closed the ports by default.


1246
0:53:50,33 --> 0:53:57,58
But IPv6 or IPsec, we
wouldn't be stupid.


1247
0:53:57,58 --> 0:53:59,53
We designed it to be aware.


1248
0:53:59,53 --> 0:54:1,3
Now it turns out
we're still stupid,


1249
0:54:1,3 --> 0:54:3,87
but that's another issue.


1250
0:54:3,87 --> 0:54:5,745
But we can't depend
upon permanent security.


1251
0:54:5,745 --> 0:54:11,75
So now anybody know the
Maginot Line in France?


1252
0:54:11,75 --> 0:54:14,54
And how how well
it worked for them.


1253
0:54:14,54 --> 0:54:17,9
Now it turns out Andre Maginot
actually was not stupid.


1254
0:54:17,9 --> 0:54:20,5
He knew you still
needed an army.


1255
0:54:20,5 --> 0:54:21,99
But he made a mistake.


1256
0:54:21,99 --> 0:54:23,901
He died.


1257
0:54:23,901 --> 0:54:25,4
And the politicians
then said, army?


1258
0:54:25,4 --> 0:54:26,5
We don't need no army.


1259
0:54:26,5 --> 0:54:28,25
We've got a wall.


1260
0:54:28,25 --> 0:54:30,57
So people are building
in these hyper things.


1261
0:54:30,57 --> 0:54:33,1
But look at Google's problem.


1262
0:54:33,1 --> 0:54:34,82
Chromecast is on
the wrong network.


1263
0:54:34,82 --> 0:54:38,19
The device doesn't work.


1264
0:54:38,19 --> 0:54:40,46
So the answer is yes.


1265
0:54:40,46 --> 0:54:43,487
We have to first have a
better security model.


1266
0:54:43,487 --> 0:54:45,57
Because when you go to
Starbucks that same machine


1267
0:54:45,57 --> 0:54:47,0
gets connected.


1268
0:54:47,0 --> 0:54:50,88
That's based at the
application level,


1269
0:54:50,88 --> 0:54:53,77
the software level doesn't
depend on the firewall.


1270
0:54:53,77 --> 0:54:56,2
In my model, even if you
have permissionless security,


1271
0:54:56,2 --> 0:54:58,98
you still can have
legacy stuff protected.


1272
0:54:58,98 --> 0:55:1,173
So I'm not saying we
get rid of all that.


1273
0:55:1,173 --> 0:55:2,423
I'm looking new opportunities.


1274
0:55:2,423 --> 0:55:5,287



1275
0:55:5,287 --> 0:55:6,745
AUDIENCE: One of
the big incentives


1276
0:55:6,745 --> 0:55:9,97
to have an apartment
network, basically.


1277
0:55:9,97 --> 0:55:13,34
A small community
network when I was


1278
0:55:13,34 --> 0:55:15,356
having a college-ish
lifestyle, was


1279
0:55:15,356 --> 0:55:20,665
that we could have our server
serving the copies of our CDs


1280
0:55:20,665 --> 0:55:22,225
to us [INAUDIBLE].


1281
0:55:22,225 --> 0:55:23,91
Now that isn't done anymore.


1282
0:55:23,91 --> 0:55:25,374
Maybe it's done centrally.


1283
0:55:25,374 --> 0:55:28,122
Do you see obvious
ways that Google


1284
0:55:28,122 --> 0:55:31,97
could enable that
sort of community hub


1285
0:55:31,97 --> 0:55:36,17
when we're otherwise serving.


1286
0:55:36,17 --> 0:55:37,35
BOB FRANKSTON: It's interesting.


1287
0:55:37,35 --> 0:55:39,736
One of the things that
Western Digital is selling


1288
0:55:39,736 --> 0:55:41,36
is a personal cloud,
which is basically


1289
0:55:41,36 --> 0:55:43,889
a disk in your house
as a server, Pogoplug.


1290
0:55:43,889 --> 0:55:46,18
A lot of people doing it, so
I can easily see products.


1291
0:55:46,18 --> 0:55:52,72
Because if you want to
watch multi-screen 3D


1292
0:55:52,72 --> 0:55:56,486
ultra high definition video,
it would be nice to cache


1293
0:55:56,486 --> 0:56:0,34
on a server right
in the building.


1294
0:56:0,34 --> 0:56:1,22
It's interesting.


1295
0:56:1,22 --> 0:56:3,75
This is sort of a
Maraschino cherry problem.


1296
0:56:3,75 --> 0:56:6,915
Maraschino is you take a cherry,
take all the cherry-ness out


1297
0:56:6,915 --> 0:56:9,31
of it, then add it back.


1298
0:56:9,31 --> 0:56:11,79
And in a sense, we've done
such a good job of conquering


1299
0:56:11,79 --> 0:56:15,73
distance, we have to
put locality back in.


1300
0:56:15,73 --> 0:56:16,605
But that's pragmatic.


1301
0:56:16,605 --> 0:56:17,57
I mean, there are two
reasons to [INAUDIBLE].


1302
0:56:17,57 --> 0:56:18,72
One is performance.


1303
0:56:18,72 --> 0:56:20,96
And fine, put a
cache server there.


1304
0:56:20,96 --> 0:56:23,5
You can put that in a box.


1305
0:56:23,5 --> 0:56:27,91
Chrome PCs should be able to
work with local cache as well


1306
0:56:27,91 --> 0:56:28,49
as remote.


1307
0:56:28,49 --> 0:56:29,967
By the way, a little footnote.


1308
0:56:29,967 --> 0:56:31,3
Be careful about the word cache.


1309
0:56:31,3 --> 0:56:33,28
Sometimes you'll
explicitly put it there.


1310
0:56:33,28 --> 0:56:36,29
You want to make sure this
information is there in case


1311
0:56:36,29 --> 0:56:39,65
you get disconnected versus
just for performance.


1312
0:56:39,65 --> 0:56:41,699
You've got multiple issues.


1313
0:56:41,699 --> 0:56:43,24
So you can easily
have protocols that


1314
0:56:43,24 --> 0:56:44,51
allow peer sharing locally.


1315
0:56:44,51 --> 0:56:47,0
This is content-centeric
networking.


1316
0:56:47,0 --> 0:56:48,44
So lots of reasons for doing it.


1317
0:56:48,44 --> 0:56:52,47
But you also want your
thermostat, your other devices,


1318
0:56:52,47 --> 0:56:56,4
to work within your house when
your connection further out


1319
0:56:56,4 --> 0:56:57,56
goes down.


1320
0:56:57,56 --> 0:57:0,51
So we have to understand
that the relationships are


1321
0:57:0,51 --> 0:57:2,73
separate geographically.


1322
0:57:2,73 --> 0:57:5,26
So there are reasons for
having geographic proximity.


1323
0:57:5,26 --> 0:57:7,37
Sometimes I want a
light switch to say turn


1324
0:57:7,37 --> 0:57:9,54
on the light in this room.


1325
0:57:9,54 --> 0:57:12,95
And you might use techniques
like IR not for the message,


1326
0:57:12,95 --> 0:57:14,98
not for sending a
message, just so you


1327
0:57:14,98 --> 0:57:17,18
know what room you're in.


1328
0:57:17,18 --> 0:57:19,71
Again, that's why
I'm saying we have


1329
0:57:19,71 --> 0:57:23,4
to rethink a lot of what the
internet is as opportunity.


1330
0:57:23,4 --> 0:57:25,765
And the distance
stuff, yeah it's nice,


1331
0:57:25,765 --> 0:57:28,73
but we forgot there's
a physical world there.


1332
0:57:28,73 --> 0:57:31,42
CB radios, we need to
do virtual CB radios.


1333
0:57:31,42 --> 0:57:37,98
So next my son is stuck on
I-70 outside of Terra Haute,


1334
0:57:37,98 --> 0:57:41,68
the truckers and stuff have a
local social network, not just


1335
0:57:41,68 --> 0:57:42,57
CB radios.


1336
0:57:42,57 --> 0:57:44,74
Though it's probably
nice that nobody else


1337
0:57:44,74 --> 0:57:47,725
has CB radios
anymore, knowing them.


1338
0:57:47,725 --> 0:57:50,266
AUDIENCE: You made a comment at
the beginning about something


1339
0:57:50,266 --> 0:57:54,904
like most [INAUDIBLE]
involved in sharing.


1340
0:57:54,904 --> 0:57:57,335
BOB FRANKSTON: Well, we
don't exchange content.


1341
0:57:57,335 --> 0:57:58,825
We exchange references.


1342
0:57:58,825 --> 0:58:0,292
Is that what you're saying?


1343
0:58:0,292 --> 0:58:1,25
AUDIENCE: I don't know.


1344
0:58:1,25 --> 0:58:2,0
I was trying to--


1345
0:58:2,0 --> 0:58:3,57
BOB FRANKSTON: When I say
Wikipedia instead of giving you


1346
0:58:3,57 --> 0:58:4,25
a copy of Wikipedia?


1347
0:58:4,25 --> 0:58:4,99
AUDIENCE: Right.


1348
0:58:4,99 --> 0:58:6,581
BOB FRANKSTON: Yes.


1349
0:58:6,581 --> 0:58:7,83
You want me to expand on that?


1350
0:58:7,83 --> 0:58:9,28
That's a very interesting topic.


1351
0:58:9,28 --> 0:58:12,26
Because I used to give
my talks and ask people


1352
0:58:12,26 --> 0:58:16,13
how much do we compress the
Encyclopedia Britannica?


1353
0:58:16,13 --> 0:58:18,31
And I say to an ISBN number.


1354
0:58:18,31 --> 0:58:22,0
And if you're a
communication theorist,


1355
0:58:22,0 --> 0:58:23,99
you want to fit it
into the old model,


1356
0:58:23,99 --> 0:58:26,74
you say, well the
ISBN is a dictionary


1357
0:58:26,74 --> 0:58:30,35
just like any of the coding
we use is a dictionary.


1358
0:58:30,35 --> 0:58:32,377
But remember, in
communication theory,


1359
0:58:32,377 --> 0:58:33,71
you have out-of-band signalling.


1360
0:58:33,71 --> 0:58:36,293
You have an out-of-band clock,
which enables a three kilohertz


1361
0:58:36,293 --> 0:58:38,315
line to carry more than
three kilohertz because


1362
0:58:38,315 --> 0:58:40,7
of precise timing.


1363
0:58:40,7 --> 0:58:42,17
But then I decided
that's nonsense.


1364
0:58:42,17 --> 0:58:42,6
it's too hard.


1365
0:58:42,6 --> 0:58:47,63
It's really that we're just
making references to things.


1366
0:58:47,63 --> 0:58:50,54
And really that's
what language is.


1367
0:58:50,54 --> 0:58:51,47
You send URLs.


1368
0:58:51,47 --> 0:58:55,88
Now URLs have URL problems.


1369
0:58:55,88 --> 0:58:58,71
And then, so your effective
capacity is meaningless.


1370
0:58:58,71 --> 0:59:2,35
This is why clocking the number
of bits of value is bad enough.


1371
0:59:2,35 --> 0:59:3,83
It's already inversed.


1372
0:59:3,83 --> 0:59:7,57
The longer the movie, the
less valuable each bit is.


1373
0:59:7,57 --> 0:59:9,1
But you can't even measure.


1374
0:59:9,1 --> 0:59:12,13
Same movie can be
a terabit or it


1375
0:59:12,13 --> 0:59:15,311
can be ten bits depending
on whether you just


1376
0:59:15,311 --> 0:59:16,81
need a reference
or you need a copy.


1377
0:59:16,81 --> 0:59:19,82



1378
0:59:19,82 --> 0:59:25,41
My mother wanted to send a
toy to her grandson in Seattle


1379
0:59:25,41 --> 0:59:26,42
from New York.


1380
0:59:26,42 --> 0:59:27,28
I said, fine.


1381
0:59:27,28 --> 0:59:29,716
I'll have it there in an hour.


1382
0:59:29,716 --> 0:59:32,9
I returned it to Radio Shack,
gave my brother the number,


1383
0:59:32,9 --> 0:59:33,131
and he bought it for him.


1384
0:59:33,131 --> 0:59:37,63



1385
0:59:37,63 --> 0:59:42,776
AUDIENCE: The bit
usage, bit used driver


1386
0:59:42,776 --> 0:59:45,332
has been people watching
movies and such.


1387
0:59:45,332 --> 0:59:47,8
BOB FRANKSTON: It actually
turns our that's not that big.


1388
0:59:47,8 --> 0:59:49,5
That's what Akamai is about.


1389
0:59:49,5 --> 0:59:50,33
They're cached locally.


1390
0:59:50,33 --> 0:59:52,8
There are two ways
it's not a big thing.


1391
0:59:52,8 --> 0:59:53,42
Number one, it's cached locally.


1392
0:59:53,42 --> 0:59:56,28
Number two, Netflix
does the compression


1393
0:59:56,28 --> 0:59:58,27
that the originally
DSL people only envy.


1394
0:59:58,27 --> 1:0:1,42
So at two megabits, they can
give you a high definition


1395
1:0:1,42 --> 1:0:3,13
experience.


1396
1:0:3,13 --> 1:0:4,88
You don't really care
[INAUDIBLE] picture.


1397
1:0:4,88 --> 1:0:7,63
You want to enjoy the movie.


1398
1:0:7,63 --> 1:0:9,739
A cute idea would be
to put a camera on,


1399
1:0:9,739 --> 1:0:11,53
and if you're enough
feet away from the TV,


1400
1:0:11,53 --> 1:0:12,785
they'll de-res it
because you're not


1401
1:0:12,785 --> 1:0:14,35
going to see the extras reses.


1402
1:0:14,35 --> 1:0:18,55
When you come closer-- the point
is there are no rules here.


1403
1:0:18,55 --> 1:0:20,2
AUDIENCE: But my
point about that


1404
1:0:20,2 --> 1:0:24,616
is that is a lot of what
people consume from an ISP.


1405
1:0:24,616 --> 1:0:26,782
BOB FRANKSTON: Well, consume
is an interesting word,


1406
1:0:26,782 --> 1:0:27,204
but we'll put that aside.


1407
1:0:27,204 --> 1:0:28,5
Yes.


1408
1:0:28,5 --> 1:0:33,24
AUDIENCE: A lot of how they're
sending bits or receiving bits.


1409
1:0:33,24 --> 1:0:36,68
What we've found with
the service I work on


1410
1:0:36,68 --> 1:0:39,8
is that if you call something
caching rather than keeping


1411
1:0:39,8 --> 1:0:43,26
a copy, then the content
owners are much more


1412
1:0:43,26 --> 1:0:46,805
willing to allow you to have
a copy on the client side.


1413
1:0:46,805 --> 1:0:48,5
Therefore, community
networks that


1414
1:0:48,5 --> 1:0:52,44
merely cache the video in
ways that the [INAUDIBLE].


1415
1:0:52,44 --> 1:0:54,0
BOB FRANKSTON: Yes.


1416
1:0:54,0 --> 1:0:55,57
Our language, our legal system.


1417
1:0:55,57 --> 1:0:59,41
Well, our legal system is
still in the 13th century.


1418
1:0:59,41 --> 1:1:1,6
Instead of science,
which tests ideas,


1419
1:1:1,6 --> 1:1:5,71
our legal system proves
things by example.


1420
1:1:5,71 --> 1:1:7,75
Not that I have anything
against lawyers,


1421
1:1:7,75 --> 1:1:10,98
but I have something
against lawyers.


1422
1:1:10,98 --> 1:1:11,58
OK.


1423
1:1:11,58 --> 1:1:13,43
MALE SPEAKER: Thank
you very much.


1424
1:1:13,43 --> 1:3:13,43
