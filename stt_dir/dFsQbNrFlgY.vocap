###7 Hey!
###10 What? l didn't say anything. l didn't do anything.
###14 What imaginary slight have you concocted in that paranoid brain of yours?
###22 <i>Crap,</i>
###23 Shouldn't there be some sort of sign...
###27 Look at that. You should put it back down before someone slips and falls.
###32 Good, because l make most decisions
###35 based on your opinion. l'm thinking of splitting up with the wife.
###38 Maybe you could mull that over. Get back to me.
###43 Floor's wet, ma'am.
###46 Little help over here. Little help.
###49 Move it or lose it, Q-tip.
###52 Q-tip. Cos you're skinny and your head's fuzzy.
###57 Something's going down.
###58 Bring it in here, you knuckleheads. Take a knee if you need to.
###63 l have been on since midnight, so l stand here
###66 with my usual contempt for all of you,
###69 but with the added wrinkle of having 1 3 cups
###72 of piss-poor excuse for coffee passing straight through me.
###76 The not-so-hidden message being, that if you screw up today,
###79 l'm going to hit you hard and fast.
###82 Now, then, l think some of you may have noticed
###86 that all 27 of the patients that were here in the lCU
###89 when l started last night are still alive,
###92 and l intend for them to still be breathing
###95 when l get the hell outta here tonight at midnight.
###99 l think you understand what kind of opportunity we have in front of us.
###106 - What opportunity... - Shut up!
###109 ln baseball, when a pitcher's hot,
###111 no one talks to him, just stay out of his way.
###113 - Why are you talking about baseball? - Cos you should never jinx a pitcher
###118 when he has a chance to throw a perfect game. My God, Barbie,
###121 how do you put your bra and panties on in the morning,
###124 all by yourself? lt's remarkable.
###128 - See, cos he's the pitcher... - Yeah, l get it now.
###148 <i>A chance to be part</i> <i>of a perfect game</i>
###150 <i>is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,</i> <i>It just never happens,</i>
###156 <i>Which is why I don't mind</i> <i>Dr Cox paging me</i>
###158 <i>for the 1 3th time this last hour,</i>
###160 <i>ICU is where</i> <i>the most critical cases get turfed,</i>
###163 <i>So many patients die here you</i> <i>think of death as another co-worker</i>
###167 <i>looking over your shoulder with the same</i> <i>demands as everyone else you work with,</i>
###172 Dr Dorian...
###174 l know you're busy, but my daughter's selling cookies.
###177 Put me down for two boxes of mint thingies.
###180 She's in second place in her troop.
###182 lf that girl who's in first keeps doing well, we're just gonna take her.
###191 Did you think you were gonna cash it in?
###193 ln your face. You're fine, thank you.
###197 Barbie.
###198 Whatever you need, l'm your girl.
###200 Get me 30 grams of Kayexalate.
###203 Don't dilly-dally trying to refill your Prozac.
###206 You're on my time now. Go.
###209 Nervous guy. Go to bed 1 8 and get me his tox screen.
###212 Cross your fingers the news is good. lf it's not, l'm blaming you.
###216 Newbie, start a drain on the purulent pericarditis in bed 23.
###220 He's a tricky bastard. He's tried to die five times on me today.
###224 - Keep an eye on him. - l'm your wingman, Maverick.
###227 l was watching <i>Top Gun,</i>
###229 Did you know that Goose is the guy from <i>ER?</i>
###232 No, l didn't. But, but please, keep talking.
###235 <i>You have to keep</i> <i>an eye on things around here</i>
###238 <i>cos just when it seems</i> <i>everything's going great</i>
###241 <i>that's when the tiniest thing</i> <i>can throw it all outta whack,</i>
###247 What are you doing? When the lunch lady asked if you wanted fries, you said no.
###251 - Yeah, but l wanted fries. - So why didn't you order fries?
###255 Cos l can't have French fries. Duh.
###260 Here. Have 'em all. Have a fry salad.
###264 What the...? Turk?
###266 Baby, come on.
###269 Girlfriend, you know l cannot have French fries.
###277 Dr Dorian, l need a favour.
###279 - l'm crazy busy today. - That's just fine, kiddo.
###283 l won't make the board meeting today.
###285 l'm going to be tied up at Dr Dorian's pity party.
###289 Should l bring something? l could rent a clown.
###292 A drunk clown hurt me once.
###294 Just listen to the damn lawyer. Go, Tom.
###297 lt's Ted. But hey, it's only been 1 2 years.
###300 One of the social workers
###302 that covers this hospital slipped and knocked herself unconscious.
###306 She might turn around and sue us.
###308 lf that happens, some of the higher-ups' heads could roll.
###315 The point is that people are less likely to sue an institution
###318 if we can put a friendly face on it. You've got a friendly face.
###322 But, sir, l...
###323 Sacred Heart is calling for your help.
###326 Will you accept the call?
###332 This is a special phone. lf you don't answer it, you get to be the intern
###337 who does the physicals over at the state prison!
###340 Hello?
###341 - How are you? l'm Dr Dorian. - Alex Hanson.
###345 Nice to meet you.
###346 Firm handshake. l like that.
###349 <i>Hello,</i>
###352 Mr Davis, l haven't seen you in three months. lt's gotta be a record for you.
###356 lgnore the dislocated shoulder and make small talk.
###360 This ought to help with the pain.
###362 So... what'd you do?
###364 Some woman just pushed me off the bus. lt was totally unprovoked.
###369 Mr Davis.
###371 l may have told her that she smelled like wet ass.
###374 There you go. Be proud of who you are.
###376 - You wear too much mascara. - You be careful now.
###379 - Hey. - What are you doing here?
###382 Covering for...
###383 Whatever. 36-year-old male, possible dislocated shoulder.
###388 Great.
###389 So, how are you doing?
###392 lt just got so cold in here.
###394 l think the swelling may have gone down.
###397 Yeah, l hope that hurts.
###399 - Oh, no. - ls this the tox screen?
###403 This does not bode well for you.
###405 Get the results of Mr Chervin's urinalysis. lf the numbers aren't good,
###410 l'm gonna give one of your kidneys to him.
###412 Ten bucks says l can make him wet himself.
###415 - Everybody's afraid of Mr Man. - Laverne, you give good sass.
###419 l got the Kayexalate and pulled the X-rays,
###422 so l am yours. Do whatever you want with me.
###424 That came out wrong.
###427 l want you to use me. l don't care how degrading it is.
###430 No, no...
###431 l know that you like torturing people, and l am up for that.
###435 - l wanna make you happy. - Marshmallow, hush.
###438 This guy needs a lumbar puncture, and l need an extra set of hands.
###442 - Ready and raring. - Ginger, get the lead out.
###444 Excuse me.
###446 - lt puts the lotion on the skin. - You can do movies and l can't?
###450 lt puts the damn iodine lotion on the skin.
###453 Mr Man!
###460 Dr Dorian, l owe you an apology.
###463 Obviously, l was unclear when l said,
###465 ''Stay in the MRl room with that patient.''
###468 lt must have sounded like, ''Leave and do other things.''
###471 Let me rephrase it so there'll be no more confusion:
###474 Get your ass back down there!
###479 You have no idea how loud that is in here!
###482 l'm sorry. You'll be done in a second.
###486 Was that a good sound?
###488 - Not that good a sound. - ls it stuck?
###491 ''Stuck'' is a literal term. lt's more like ''not moving''.
###494 - Pull me outta here! - l can't. You were unconscious.
###498 You could have an injury. Be glad you're not claustrophobic.
###503 - Promise you won't leave me. - l promise.
###507 Dr Cox must have my pager on speed dial. He's completely on top of me today.
###511 Do you know how much l wish he was on top of me?
###514 That's naughty.
###516 You make me so mad, l might actually scream.
###518 Every day you bitch about how hard Dr Cox is on you,
###521 and you don't even realise that you're his go-to guy.
###525 - You're overreacting... - What has he had you do today?
###528 He had me intubate and extubate Mrs Pollard,
###531 float a Swan on Mr Kalka, a paracentesis, a radial art line,
###535 then place a transvenous pacemaker for a heart block.
###538 Why? What did you do?
###544 Cream, no sugar.
###548 He takes his sugar, no cream.
###555 My arm is breaking!
###557 OK. lt's not going in.
###560 Really? Why don't we try kicking it?
###562 - l'll talk to one of our orthopaedics. - Hurry back.
###565 That guy is the worst.
###567 Be nice. He's my boyfriend.
###570 - Not for long. - Excuse me?
###574 He's been dying to run outta here since he came in.
###576 - He did not run out of here. - You're right.
###580 He was fleeing like he was being chased by a swarm of killer bees.
###583 He said just keep pulling.
###586 Goody.
###588 Does this big metal contraption make me look fat?
###592 More chunky than fat.
###595 - JD? - lt's all right. l'm right here.
###600 You're such a nice guy.
###602 <i>It really feels like</i> <i>there's something going on here,</i>
###606 <i>I wonder what she looks like,</i>
###609 Why am l always in your fantasies?
###612 You got a problem.
###616 Why are you squeezing all my fingers?
###618 l'll tell you what l'm not doing. l'm not checking for a wedding ring.
###622 <i>I am so in,</i>
###626 <i>I'm right back out,</i>
###629 l'm sorry about lunch. l'm a little overtired.
###631 That's OK. When we get home, we can go right to bed.
###635 That's the thing. l'm beat,
###637 so it'd be better if you crash at your place tonight.
###644 lt's a private joke.
###648 - What now? - Watch the attitude,
###650 or l won't let you go to the bonfire with the beach bunnies.
###655 <i>I was probably thinking</i> <i>about the MRI girl</i>
###658 <i>but I believe that giving a friend the</i> <i>chance to shine was just as important,</i>
###663 Sir, it's Dr Kelso. He's making me baby-sit this patient.
###667 lt's the bottom of the ninth. lf you're not gonna be my catcher, who is?
###677 - What? -<i>Play ball!</i>
###681 Come on, baby. Right here. Bring it in.
###691 Dr Cox, you can trust me to help you.
###693 l was top five in my class.
###696 That's the noise l make when somebody lies to me.
###700 But l'll get us this perfect...
###702 - Don't say it! - ...game.
###703 What part of ''don't say it'' did you not understand?
###706 The ''don't'' or the ''say it''? Help me to help you, Barbie.
###715 l should get to work.
###717 That would be lovely.
###722 - Elliot, do... - No time!
###725 <i>We all have</i> <i>important things to do,</i>
###728 Do you know what Alex Hanson looks like?
###730 He's OK.
###732 l don't know. l don't look at the ladies.
###736 Young man, l've been married for over three decades.
###739 l would've gone there, though. Hell yes, l would've.
###742 Who cares? No one will ever love you.
###745 l don't find her pretty, but since my wife left,
###748 when l look at a woman, l find it hard to see past the evil.
###754 - Something's wrong. - Nothing's wrong.
###756 You always say that, then you sulk, then you tell me.
###759 You haven't known me long enough for me to ''always'' do anything.
###762 You're always hurting me.
###764 - So now you're getting defensive? - Woman, l am not defensive.
###768 You are, a little bit.
###769 Turk, why don't you just take a deep breath and tell me what's wrong?
###776 That did it.
###777 l guess we're done here.
###783 Barbie, plates are wobbling everywhere.
###786 l'm starting pressors.
###788 Or you could transfuse him.
###790 - Transfusions are riskier. - My instinct was pressors.
###793 - Know what they say about instincts? - Stick with them.
###797 - Should you? - Should l?
###798 You'll have time to think about it on the bench. That's where you're headed.
###803 Get out of here. Go ahead. Go. Hippety-hop to the barbershop.
###807 ''Should l?''
###810 Did she ask what you look like?
###813 No, she can tell l'm handsome. l have a husky voice. ''Hello, baby.''
###817 Look into your heart and see how it feels.
###819 My heart hates ''uggos''.
###821 That's what's wrong with you men.
###824 You're so afraid of what you feel. l'm so sick of it.
###828 So do you know what she looks like?
###830 Yeah, l do. But l ain't telling you.
###833 Just tell me. Does she look anything like Jimmie Walker?
###840 l'm noticing the bottoms of your slippers are rather slick.
###843 Perhaps they contributed in some way to the incident this morning.
###847 Those are hospital booties, you moron.
###850 And now l'm a moron.
###853 Dr Dorian, why don't you take Ms Hanson out for a lovely dinner?
###857 Dr Kelso, l'm not suing the hospital.
###860 lt turns out l only have a mild concussion.
###863 Alex? He's gone.
###865 So, what restaurant are you taking me to?
###870 <i>You're not bad if you want to wait</i> <i>and see what she looks like,</i>
###873 l'm kidding. You don't have to take me out to dinner.
###876 Are you sure? Cos... OK.
###881 l gotta go. Sorry.
###883 Don't sweat it. We'll see each other around.
###886 JD, l'm really glad you were here...
###888 Ms Hanson, he's gone.
###891 lf l were in your slippers, l'd sue this hospital for all it's worth.
###896 Really?
###897 We could run away together.
###901 You know what to do. Be straight with Carla, no matter how hard it is.
###906 l hate this part.
###910 l just don't know what to do about Dr Cox.
###913 - What is going on here? - l say one thing, he says the other.
###917 l can't take it any more.
###919 Why don't you become a lesbian, and hook up with some hot model?
###923 - What's that got to do with anything? - l just thought it'd be hot.
###927 He's testing you. You can't be afraid to disagree with him.
###932 - You're afraid. - But l still do it.
###937 Get back in the game, Elliot.
###1043 Dammit!
###1047 So close. Dammit!
###1052 l'm sorry.
###1054 l'll be fine.
###1060 Perfect game.
###1063 Call it.
###1064 There's five minutes left, just the two of us here. Can't we just wait?
###1068 Just call it.
###1073 No.
###1074 We all need this, so, no.
###1077 l won't call it.
###1079 That's the dumbest thing anybody's said to me around here in a long time.
###1084 There's nothing wrong with a one-hitter. ln fact, it's miraculous.
###1089 l won't have you cheapen what should be an endless pursuit of perfection
###1093 just because you want the world to laugh with you tonight.
###1096 Now, call it.
###1098 Time of death, 1 1 .55.
###1101 Good girl.
###1103 Better go get yourself a cup of coffee.
###1106 New game starts in four minutes.
###1115 Hey, Carla.
###1117 Carla, wait!
###1120 Where are you going?
###1121 l'm gonna go crash at my place tonight, like you said.
###1125 You want to know? That's what's wrong.
###1127 ''l'm gonna go chill out at my house, like you said.''
###1130 God, you're so sexy right now.
###1132 l've been doing a lot of thinking. And, you know...
###1135 We're past that new, exciting relationship phase,
###1138 and all that's left is us.
###1140 Baby, l gotta tell you, you drive me crazy.
###1143 You take my French fries, you boss me around in front of my friends.
###1147 You said strong women turn you on.
###1149 We know what you're gonna do, so why not do it so l can go home?
###1155 OK.
###1161 l love you.
###1164 You annoy me more than l ever thought possible,
###1167 but l want to spend every irritating minute with you.
###1173 Me too.
###1175 Yeah?
###1177 l love you.
###1183 l don't get it. Why are you doing this to me?
###1185 All l wanted to do was have sex with a foxy nurse, and now l'm in love?
###1189 Sweetie, that happens.
###1196 <i>I've been thinking lately</i> <i>about taking chances,,,</i>
###1199 Run a tox screen and a full blood workup for the guy in 37.
###1202 You can handle that?
###1204 - Yeah. - Good girl.
###1205 Up on the second floor... There's a laundry list of stuff l want you to do.
###1209 <i>,,,and how it's just</i> <i>about overcoming your fears,</i>
###1212 <i>Because every time</i> <i>you take a big risk in your life</i>
###1215 <i>no matter how it ends up</i> <i>you're always glad you took it,</i>
###1221 Wait! Stop the machine.
###1223 - What the hell are you doing? - Will you go out with me?
###1227 lf l say no, will you let me out of this thing?
###1229 - lt's iffy. - Then l guess l have to say yes.
###1232 - So say it. - Sure. l'd love to.
###1241 Huh?
