###12 ELANA ADLER: Hi, I'm Elana Adler, and
###15 we're Hedgeboken Hedgehogs.
###18 -That's awesome.
###20 ELANA ADLER: The bane of my mother's existence.
###21 -It's so weird because they're so cute, I want to pet them.
###25 But then--
###26 ELANA ADLER: They're fine with being petted once you're
###28 holding them.
###29 But when the hand just comes at them, they freak.
###31 Because they don't know what's going on.
###33 They're very independent.
###34 They'll take you or leave you.
###36 If you want to interact with them, great.
###38 They do enjoy the company.
###39 But they're also just fine about being on their own.
###44 That's definitely cute.
###45 
###48 -There they are.
###50 
###54 What's with the tubing, the fact that they always like to
###57 go into tubes?
###58 ELANA ADLER: It's because they like to burrow and dig.
###60 So they're digging.
###62 There are two of them in a tube.
###64 -Got a double tube action.
###67 ELANA ADLER: It's a push me, pull you.
###69 -So do you know why hedgehogs are illegal in certain states?
###75 ELANA ADLER: I know California they're illegal.
###77 But I think that has a lot to do with them cracking down on
###81 any animals that could be introduced and potentially
###85 become feral there.
###87 Is this is Isabella.
###88 She's very friendly.
###89 She's what we call a chocolate chip, because she has a lot of
###93 white quills with some brown quills interspersed.
###97 So this is a Chock.
###98 I have two little snowballs to show you.
###101 Some people don't like the albinos.
###102 You either love them or you hate them.
###104 I think they're very cute.
###106 Their quills are just growing in.
###107 They had their first baby set.
###108 Now they're getting a bigger set.
###110 And he's actually being very good, because he's letting us
###112 see his nose.
###113 
###118 See if they want to run down the hall.
###120 -They're so wobbly.
###122 
###125 ELANA ADLER: Look how nicely that girl is cooperating.
###126 
###133 This is Oren.
###134 He's one of my boys.
###138 I'm a big pudgemeister.
