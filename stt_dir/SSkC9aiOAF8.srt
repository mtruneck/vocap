treatment center called YAKITA


23
0:1:19,72 --> 0:1:25,73
in Bogor, an area about 60
kilometers outside Jakarta.


24
0:1:25,73 --> 0:1:28,36
Indonesia experienced the
beginnings of an unprecedented


25
0:1:28,36 --> 0:1:30,98
drug epidemic in the 1980s.


26
0:1:30,98 --> 0:1:33,35
Sparked in part by rapid
economic growth and the


27
0:1:33,35 --> 0:1:37,4
increasing availability of new
drugs, Indonesia found itself


28
0:1:37,4 --> 0:1:41,33
facing a crisis it had no
idea how to handle.


29
0:1:41,33 --> 0:1:45,33
A couple, David and Joyce,
founded the center in 1999 in


30
0:1:45,33 --> 0:1:48,3
response to the growing
problem.


31
0:1:48,3 --> 0:1:50,55
DAVID GORDON: The drug of choice
that really kicked it


32
0:1:50,55 --> 0:1:55,39
off was ecstasy in the '80s, in
the early '80s, because it


33
0:1:55,39 --> 0:1:57,81
became the love drug.


34
0:1:57,81 --> 0:1:59,26
And it was in the
discotheques.


35
0:1:59,26 --> 0:2:0,96
It was in the night life.


36
0:2:0,96 --> 0:2:5,97
And from there it immediately
dropped to heroin.


37
0:2:5,97 --> 0:2:10,31
And then in the late '90s
is when shabu shabu


38
0:2:10,31 --> 0:2:14,31
methamphetamine began
to surface.


39
0:2:14,31 --> 0:2:16,6
HANNAH BROOKS: In the past
decade, shabu shabu has


40
0:2:16,6 --> 0:2:19,55
overtaken heroin as Indonesia's
drug of choice,


41
0:2:19,55 --> 0:2:22,21
with meth labs popping up all
over the country, making it


42
0:2:22,21 --> 0:2:24,45
cheap and easy to access.


43
0:2:24,45 --> 0:2:26,53
DAVID GORDON: There was no
recovery in the country.


44
0:2:26,53 --> 0:2:29,22
Hospitalization was
unheard of.


45
0:2:29,22 --> 0:2:31,86

Where do you start when

48

HANNAH BROOKS: While YAKITA is
a center for men, they also


49
0:2:39,74 --> 0:2:42,41
run a program for female
addicts and partners of


50
0:2:42,41 --> 0:2:46,9
addicts, focused on providing
support, skills, and income.


51
0:2:46,9 --> 0:2:50,72
These women design and produce
sandals called junkies.


52
0:2:50,72 --> 0:2:51,63

53
0:2:51,63 --> 0:2:52,8

women had made shoes before,


64
0:3:38,77 --> 0:3:41,55
their initial designs were
simple slip on sandals,


65
