0:0:0,31 --> 0:0:2,38
OJ: Today, a nerd teaches
us about hip hop.


3
0:0:2,38 --> 0:0:4,97
We find out how great cleavage
can make you a YouTube star.


4
0:0:4,97 --> 0:0:7,1
And we get higher than we've
ever been with a


5
0:0:7,1 --> 0:0:8,15

0:0:8,15 --> 0:0:9,852
MALE SPEAKER: Vice Today.

0:0:9,852 --> 0:0:15,225
Bi-weekly, bite-sized doses of
sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll.

0:0:19,1 --> 0:0:21,1
OJ: Welcome to another edition
of Vice Today.


10
0:0:21,1 --> 0:0:24,54
I'm OJ, filling in for Ryan
Duffy, who is either sick or


11
0:0:24,54 --> 0:0:26,48
has been kidnapped by
the Legion of Doom.


12
0:0:26,48 --> 0:0:29,23
On this episode, we meet another
one of our weird and


13
0:0:29,23 --> 0:0:32,3
wonderful friends from the
internet, the Reply Girl, in


14
0:0:32,3 --> 0:0:34,58
the third installment
of My Life Online.


15
0:0:34,58 --> 0:0:37,49
Then we find out about the
future of interior design in


16
0:0:37,49 --> 0:0:41,1
outer space with our premiere
episode of Spaced Out.


17
0:0:41,1 --> 0:0:43,61
But first, we check in with
our favorite office house


18
0:0:43,61 --> 0:0:46,74
plant, Hanson O'Haver, for
another installment of What's


19
0:0:46,74 --> 0:0:47,255
Up with Drake?


20
0:0:47,255 --> 0:0:51,38
[MUSIC PLAYING]


21
0:0:51,38 --> 0:0:52,88
HANSON O'HAVER: Hey,
I'm Hanson O'Haver.


22
0:0:52,88 --> 0:0:55,23
So Drake did a couple of
interviews recently where he


23
0:0:55,23 --> 0:0:57,11
talked about some hot
button issues.


24
0:0:57,11 --> 0:0:59,76
In one, he talked about his
substance use, which is


25
0:0:59,76 --> 0:1:3,81
basically that he smokes pot
occasionally, drinks a little


26
0:1:3,81 --> 0:1:6,67
bit of wine, and occasionally
sips lean.


27
0:1:6,67 --> 0:1:9,28
And then in another interview,
he talked about how he's


28
0:1:9,28 --> 0:1:11,78
single, but he's definitely
looking for the one.


29
0:1:11,78 --> 0:1:14,55
I think that when you compare
these statements to like, for


30
0:1:14,55 --> 0:1:18,25
example, the recent GQ Rick Ross
interview, which was like


31
0:1:18,25 --> 0:1:23,28
six pages of just Mercedes and
strippers and just like sex


32
0:1:23,28 --> 0:1:27,3
rooms and food and so much weed,
it sort of gets at a


33
0:1:27,3 --> 0:1:29,59
larger point about Drake's
relatability.


34
0:1:29,59 --> 0:1:31,28
I think that the most
interesting part of "Take


35
0:1:31,28 --> 0:1:34,41
Care" is probably when the
heartfelt voicemail from his


36
0:1:34,41 --> 0:1:37,76
grandma segs into the beat
from "Back That Azz Up."


37
0:1:37,76 --> 0:1:41,29
But a close runner up, I think,
is when he says, I've


38
0:1:41,29 --> 0:1:42,45
had sex four times this week.


39
0:1:42,45 --> 0:1:43,5
I'll explain.


40
0:1:43,5 --> 0:1:46,3
Because even assuming that
he's talking about four


41
0:1:46,3 --> 0:1:49,11
different people, it's
not that much sex.


42
0:1:49,11 --> 0:1:52,28
I mean, Drake's a very famous
guy, and presumably millions


43
0:1:52,28 --> 0:1:53,71
of women want to have
sex with him.


44
0:1:53,71 --> 0:1:56,3
Whereas, I feel confident that
there's probably someone in


45
0:1:56,3 --> 0:1:59,11
this office that has had sex
with four people this week.


46
0:1:59,11 --> 0:2:3,52

47
0:2:3,52 --> 0:2:4,89
OJ: You know what, he's
not a house plant.


48
0:2:4,89 --> 0:2:6,74
He's actually a fern.


49
0:2:6,74 --> 0:2:9,13
Next up, we travel to Montreal,
where we met with


50
0:2:9,13 --> 0:2:11,16
Alejandra Gaitan, who makes
her living on the


51
0:2:11,16 --> 0:2:12,55

0:2:21,92 --> 0:2:23,916

MALE YOUTUBER 1: There's a trend
happening on YouTube


65
0:2:37,31 --> 0:2:39,67
right now which is basically
just a bunch of fat-tittied


66
0:2:39,67 --> 0:2:41,98
girls making stupid-ass
reply videos to


67
0:2:41,98 --> 0:2:43,44
everything that comes up.

flipping everywhere, even on

0:2:44,97 --> 0:2:47,21

about reply girls.

There will be about five down
here to the left of me.

0:2:50,47 --> 0:2:51,176
You look down in related videos,
there'll probably be


72
0:2:51,176 --> 0:2:52,52
some reply girls there.


73
0:2:52,52 --> 0:2:54,23

do shitty videos.

They're completely terrible.

girls yapping nonsense for

long enough to fit an ad in
so they can make money.


77
0:3:1,18 --> 0:3:3,58
THE LUCHADOR: People take hours
and hours and hours to


78
0:3:3,58 --> 0:3:5,45
produce a quality video
and original content.


79
0:3:5,45 --> 0:3:8,142
And they just pretty much
watch it for pride.


80
0:3:8,142 --> 0:3:11,94
And they get 100 times
what I would get in


81
0:3:11,94 --> 0:3:13,15

end result is

almost painful to watch.

When I started YouTubing, I was
below the poverty line,


100
0:3:55,5 --> 0:4:0,13
and I really, really, really
needed a way to get out of


101
0:4:0,13 --> 0:4:1,37
that situation.


102
0:4:1,37 --> 0:4:2,49
Hi guys.

My first month, I made enough
to pay a cell phone bill.

It was-- and I worked so much.


105
0:4:7,96 --> 0:4:10,15
Well, it's very simple.


106
0:4:10,15 --> 0:4:12,1
You go on YouTube, and
you look for the


107
0:4:12,1 --> 0:4:14,92
videos that are trending.


108
0:4:14,92 --> 0:4:19,61

some advice.

was that she


122
0:4:47,39 --> 0:4:49,325
showed me her check.


123
0:4:49,325 --> 0:4:50,6
And it was a nice check.


124
0:4:50,6 --> 0:4:54,3
For what she does, it was a
very, very beautiful check.


125

ALEJANDRA GAITAN: I always
wanted to be an autonomous


126
0:4:57,46 --> 0:5:3,9
worker or have a company
or make money on my


127
0:5:3,9 --> 0:5:6,56
own, be my own boss.


128
0:5:6,56 --> 0:5:11,5
And I just never knew what
exactly I wanted to


129
0:5:11,5 --> 0:5:12,75
do to make it happen.


130

0:5:15,16 --> 0:5:16,81
I want it to happen.


132
0:5:16,81 --> 0:5:21,56
I started programming but that
didn't work out very well


133
0:5:21,56 --> 0:5:23,91
because I'm not--


134
0:5:23,91 --> 0:5:26,75
I'm not a very good
programmer.

babysitting, but


136
0:5:31,1 --> 0:5:33,29
that's how it is.


137
0:5:33,29 --> 0:5:36,4
THE LUCHADOR: I tried doing
replies myself.


138
0:5:36,4 --> 0:5:38,3
And believe it or not, it's
a harder job than


139
0:5:38,3 --> 0:5:39,63
you think it is.


140
0:5:39,63 --> 0:5:42,4
It's long, it's boring,
tedious.


141
0:5:42,4 --> 0:5:43,44
It's annoying.

there who are hating on reply

they do is brainless.

You know what, do it yourself.

do it and don't watch it.

There's times that these haters,
they're posting videos


149
0:6:1,39 --> 0:6:3,96
and threats about finding her
address, her IP address, and


150
0:6:3,96 --> 0:6:5,24
knowing where she lives.


151
0:6:5,24 --> 0:6:9,3
I've seen posts on YouTube,
people actually posting, and


152
0:6:9,3 --> 0:6:10,86
they thought that they
found her address.


153
0:6:10,86 --> 0:6:12,5
And they post it everywhere.


154
0:6:12,5 --> 0:6:18,26
What kind of a bad person are
you to take a hated person's


155
0:6:18,26 --> 0:6:20,25
address and post it
to the public?


156
0:6:20,25 --> 0:6:23,78
So someone, some crazy person
comes over and sees the


157
0:6:23,78 --> 0:6:25,716
address and does something
that they're going to


158
0:6:25,716 --> 0:6:28,21
regret later on.

those crazy, underfunded nerds

at NASA to find out what their
interior designers have in


167
0:6:50,37 --> 0:6:53,43

become a barren wasteland.

EVAN TWYFORD: Three-dimensional
design, for


171
0:7:1,44 --> 0:7:5,11
me, was always kind of the
greatest form of creation,


172
0:7:5,11 --> 0:7:9,95
being able to take an idea from
that very tiny amount of


173
0:7:9,95 --> 0:7:12,37
energy, being this idea
in your head, and then


174
0:7:12,37 --> 0:7:14,69
formulating that into
a fully functional


175
0:7:14,69 --> 0:7:16,14
three-dimensional product.


176
0:7:16,14 --> 0:7:18,71
Take that step further, I
always kind of wanted to


177
0:7:18,71 --> 0:7:20,81
design the ultimate


178
0:7:20,81 --> 0:7:22,41
three-dimensional object, right?


179
0:7:22,41 --> 0:7:26,13
And so, designing space
vehicles, to me, was like that


180
0:7:26,13 --> 0:7:27,21
ultimate form of creation.


181
0:7:27,21 --> 0:7:29,81
It's like, what's the most
bad-ass thing you can design


182
0:7:29,81 --> 0:7:30,9
would be a spaceship.


183
0:7:30,9 --> 0:7:36,16
And NASA really was kind of
the final frontier for me.


184
0:7:36,16 --> 0:7:45,22



185
0:7:45,22 --> 0:7:49,31
My name's Evan Twyford, and I'm
a habitability designer at


186
0:7:49,31 --> 0:7:50,88
NASA's Johnson Space Center.


187
0:7:50,88 --> 0:7:57,29
[MUSIC PLAYING]


188
0:7:57,29 --> 0:8:0,36
EVAN TWYFORD: We, in our group,
do conceptual design


189
0:8:0,36 --> 0:8:2,7
for NASA's Human Space Flight.


190
0:8:2,7 --> 0:8:7,9
A lot of these projects are
coming down as major, kind of


191
0:8:7,9 --> 0:8:10,77
campaign-level design projects
where they're saying, hey,


192
0:8:10,77 --> 0:8:12,94
we're doing a mission
to the moon.


193
0:8:12,94 --> 0:8:15,62
We're working on a pressurized
rover.


194
0:8:15,62 --> 0:8:17,55
We've got this idea, and
we want you guys to


195
0:8:17,55 --> 0:8:18,6
help us make it happen.


196
0:8:18,6 --> 0:8:20,98
So starting off with sketching
and rendering, very


197
0:8:20,98 --> 0:8:25,38
conceptual, take it to a
full-scale, mock-up phase out


198
0:8:25,38 --> 0:8:29,4
of wood, foam core, low-fidelity
materials.


199
0:8:29,4 --> 0:8:32,799
We use those to kind of sketch
out the volume of how big the


200
0:8:32,799 --> 0:8:36,59
vehicle might be and how it
might feel on the inside.


201
0:8:36,59 --> 0:8:39,12
Part of what we'll do when we're
designing a habitat is


202
0:8:39,12 --> 0:8:42,32
we'll look at how the corners,
how the edges are treated,


203
0:8:42,32 --> 0:8:44,23
what type of paint schemes
are going to go inside.


204
0:8:44,23 --> 0:8:46,36
There was actually an issue with
one of the colors that


205
0:8:46,36 --> 0:8:48,86
they had painted on the
International Space Station,


206
0:8:48,86 --> 0:8:52,1
where one of the hatches was
like a salmon color.


207
0:8:52,1 --> 0:8:55,8
And the crew really disliked
it, so we try to


208
0:8:55,8 --> 0:8:57,23
avoid salmon now.


209
0:8:57,23 --> 0:8:59,9
And then working out the details
in a CAD system on the


210
0:8:59,9 --> 0:9:3,4
computer and developing a
fully-functional prototype.


211
0:9:3,4 --> 0:9:7,64

212
0:9:7,64 --> 0:9:10,266
EVAN TWYFORD: The type of design
at NASA that we do kind


213
0:9:10,266 --> 0:9:13,39
of crosses the line between
fine art and engineering.


214
0:9:13,39 --> 0:9:16,1
So it's a lot more problem
solving, though, which is what


215
0:9:16,1 --> 0:9:19,1
makes it really exciting.


216
0:9:19,1 --> 0:9:26,4
So this is the SEV, the Space
Exploration Vehicle on the


217
0:9:26,4 --> 0:9:29,44
chassis, Gen1B.


218
0:9:29,44 --> 0:9:35,15
For interior design for space
vehicles, there is certainly


219
0:9:35,15 --> 0:9:39,63
the problem of confinement,
which is a psychological issue


220
0:9:39,63 --> 0:9:41,13
for crew members over time.


221
0:9:41,13 --> 0:9:44,9
So we have to deal with ways of
designing environments and


222
0:9:44,9 --> 0:9:51,21
designing products that will
reduce the effects of feelings


223
0:9:51,21 --> 0:9:53,21
of confinement in space.


224
0:9:53,21 --> 0:9:59,0
Yeah, so this is the interior
of the SEV Rover, Gen1B.


225
0:9:59,0 --> 0:10:3,76
And most of the interior design
elements was a product


226
0:10:3,76 --> 0:10:6,49
of our team, as well the
robotics team that we've been


227
0:10:6,49 --> 0:10:9,97
working with on this vehicle
for some time.


228
0:10:9,97 --> 0:10:13,33
And we've been charged with
making the interior of the


229
0:10:13,33 --> 0:10:17,4
vehicle more comfortable and
more luxurious, if you can


230
0:10:17,4 --> 0:10:18,8
call it that.


231
0:10:18,8 --> 0:10:23,68
[SPACE SOUNDS]


232
0:10:23,68 --> 0:10:25,42
EVAN TWYFORD: Seeing as most of
us haven't actually been to


233
0:10:25,42 --> 0:10:28,16
outer space, it can make
things very difficult


234
0:10:28,16 --> 0:10:30,52
sometimes because everybody has
a different opinion, or


235
0:10:30,52 --> 0:10:33,22
different assumptions that
they're making about what that


236
0:10:33,22 --> 0:10:34,27
experience is like.


237
0:10:34,27 --> 0:10:38,53
It's a very testing and
evaluation-intensive work


238
0:10:38,53 --> 0:10:39,9
environment.


239
0:10:39,9 --> 0:10:43,23
So we have to do whatever we
can to ensure that these


240
0:10:43,23 --> 0:10:45,42
products will work in their
intended environment.


241
0:10:45,42 --> 0:10:50,7
So sometimes that means flying
products or mock ups on a zero


242
0:10:50,7 --> 0:10:55,45
gravity flight in the
parabolic aircraft.


243
0:10:55,45 --> 0:10:57,96
Sometimes it means going out
into the desert and testing


244
0:10:57,96 --> 0:11:2,82
them in a very harsh kind of
desolate environment that


245
0:11:2,82 --> 0:11:4,95
might be similar to what we
would encounter in space.

[MUSIC PLAYING]


247
0:11:12,82 --> 0:11:13,94
EVAN TWYFORD: There's always
that kind of thing with


248
0:11:13,94 --> 0:11:16,965
designers between, are you going
to be like a stylist or


249
0:11:16,965 --> 0:11:18,3
are you going to be
a problem solver?


250
0:11:18,3 --> 0:11:24,23
And you can look at a product,
and say this accomplishes


251
0:11:24,23 --> 0:11:26,74
exactly what we needed to
accomplish, and that's what


252
0:11:26,74 --> 0:11:29,45
makes it beautiful, and that's
what makes it successful.


253
0:11:29,45 --> 0:11:32,99
It's a very pure design problem
that we're dealing


254
0:11:32,99 --> 0:11:37,7
with, which is to create
products and environments that


255
0:11:37,7 --> 0:11:43,12
the crew will find useful and
will make them successful and


256
0:11:43,12 --> 0:11:47,62
productive in their
daily routines.


257
0:11:47,62 --> 0:11:49,27
MALE SPEAKER: Go for
main engine start.


258
0:11:49,27 --> 0:11:56,35
T-minus 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5--


259
0:11:56,35 --> 0:11:58,76
all three engines
up and burning--


260
0:11:58,76 --> 0:12:2,27
2, 1, 0, and lift off.


261
0:12:2,27 --> 0:12:3,83
The final lift off
of Atlantis.


262
0:12:3,83 --> 0:12:6,85



263
0:12:6,85 --> 0:12:8,63
EVAN TWYFORD: The shuttle
program and the International


264
0:12:8,63 --> 0:12:13,62
Space Station were started
in the '80s as sort of a


265
0:12:13,62 --> 0:12:16,77
longer-term analog for human
space flight and establishing


266
0:12:16,77 --> 0:12:20,95
a permanent, human presence in
space to start to learn more


267
0:12:20,95 --> 0:12:25,91
about how humans would behave
and interact in longer-term


268
0:12:25,91 --> 0:12:27,265
space flight scenarios.


269
0:12:27,265 --> 0:12:36,58
[MUSIC PLAYING]


270
0:12:36,58 --> 0:12:40,1
EVAN TWYFORD: I kind of felt
like a lot of people, in


271
0:12:40,1 --> 0:12:44,91
general, are maybe not as
excited by the International


272
0:12:44,91 --> 0:12:48,17
Space Station or by the shuttle
program, or at least


273
0:12:48,17 --> 0:12:50,88
not as much as they were maybe
in the '80s when the shuttle


274
0:12:50,88 --> 0:12:52,37
was brand new.


275
0:12:52,37 --> 0:12:56,43
I just hope that we can really
re-engage people in the right


276
0:12:56,43 --> 0:12:59,4
way, and get people excited
about space flight because


277
0:12:59,4 --> 0:13:1,64
this next generation of space
vehicles is going to be the


278
0:13:1,64 --> 0:13:5,53
most bad-ass that
we've ever seen.
