1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:4,81



2
0:0:4,81 --> 0:0:8,87
THOM DEVITA: Malone said you
should tattoo with a Singer


3
0:0:8,87 --> 0:0:11,92
sewing machine if you
know how to tattoo.


4
0:0:11,92 --> 0:0:14,9
So I tell that to Nick--


5
0:0:14,9 --> 0:0:15,909
you probably don't even
remember this--


6
0:0:15,909 --> 0:0:19,785
and Nick said, but
they're so heavy.


7
0:0:19,785 --> 0:0:21,12
Do you remember that?


8
0:0:21,12 --> 0:0:23,261
NICK BUBASH: I don't
remember anything.


9
0:0:23,261 --> 0:0:24,87
I can remember the little
things, but


10
0:0:24,87 --> 0:0:26,5
that's in that article.


11
0:0:26,5 --> 0:0:27,87
She wrote that in
that article.


12
0:0:27,87 --> 0:0:29,29
THOM DEVITA: Oh, is
that the one?


13
0:0:29,29 --> 0:0:30,475
Oh, it was that girl?


14
0:0:30,475 --> 0:0:35,195
NICK BUBASH: She called you
up and interviewed you.


15
0:0:35,195 --> 0:0:37,545
THOM DEVITA: No, she didn't
interview me.


16
0:0:37,545 --> 0:0:38,7
NICK BUBASH: On the phone?


17
0:0:38,7 --> 0:0:40,82
THOM DEVITA: No, it
was an intervisit.


18
0:0:40,82 --> 0:0:42,22
NICK BUBASH: Did she
come up here?


19
0:0:42,22 --> 0:0:43,8
THOM DEVITA: It was
an intervisit.


20
0:0:43,8 --> 0:0:45,222
NICK BUBASH: OK,
an intervisit.


21
0:0:45,222 --> 0:0:47,37
THOM DEVITA: Because I don't
give interviews.


22
0:0:47,37 --> 0:0:48,89
NICK BUBASH: This is
not an interview.


23
0:0:48,89 --> 0:0:57,152



24
0:0:57,152 --> 0:1:0,93
JOHN WYATT: When they meet
Thom, they will realize


25
0:1:0,93 --> 0:1:3,92
they've never met anybody
like him before.


26
0:1:3,92 --> 0:1:6,59
He's probably the most different
person, without


27
0:1:6,59 --> 0:1:9,605
trying to be different, of
anybody I've ever met.


28
0:1:9,605 --> 0:1:13,74
ROBERT RYAN: I was a deVita
devotee from the beginning.


29
0:1:13,74 --> 0:1:16,23
It just unlocked this whole
world that I was already


30
0:1:16,23 --> 0:1:19,645
totally into of the lower-East
Side of New York.


31
0:1:19,645 --> 0:1:22,32
There was just this creative
energy there that I think


32
0:1:22,32 --> 0:1:25,702
Thom's work definitely
emanates.


33
0:1:25,702 --> 0:1:27,76
SCOTT HARRISON: He does
what he's inspired


34
0:1:27,76 --> 0:1:28,89
to do at the moment.


35
0:1:28,89 --> 0:1:31,86
He observes and he thinks
carefully about what he sees


36
0:1:31,86 --> 0:1:36,58
and he develops his
own take on it.


37
0:1:36,58 --> 0:1:39,218
-He wasn't just a tattoo
artist, he was


38
0:1:39,218 --> 0:1:43,511
an artist who tattooed.


39
0:1:43,511 --> 0:1:46,43
-You know, it was all one big
ball of wax with him.


40
0:1:46,43 --> 0:1:48,52
Everything he did was art--


41
0:1:48,52 --> 0:1:51,77
the way he lived, the way he
talked, the way he thought,


42
0:1:51,77 --> 0:1:54,17
what he did, where he went.


43
0:1:54,17 --> 0:1:56,985
The tattoos were just as
important as the floor.


44
0:1:56,985 --> 0:2:1,498



45
0:2:1,498 --> 0:2:3,812
THOM DEVITA: If I said
I was an artist, then


46
0:2:3,812 --> 0:2:5,318
I'd be shaming artists.


47
0:2:5,318 --> 0:2:12,728



48
0:2:12,728 --> 0:2:14,21
[INAUDIBLE].


49
0:2:14,21 --> 0:2:16,68
Want to see 100 of them?


50
0:2:16,68 --> 0:2:17,668
-Sure.


51
0:2:17,668 --> 0:2:20,82
THOM DEVITA: When you see color
in my work, that means


52
0:2:20,82 --> 0:2:25,702
it didn't work in black
and I had to color it.


53
0:2:25,702 --> 0:2:28,83
ED HARDY: Just his perceptions
are so completely unique.


54
0:2:28,83 --> 0:2:31,17
And all these years we've been
trying to get the high art


55
0:2:31,17 --> 0:2:32,31
world to recognize him.


56
0:2:32,31 --> 0:2:35,23
And he's just so out there
they just didn't know


57
0:2:35,23 --> 0:2:36,9
where to place it.


58
0:2:36,9 --> 0:2:38,12
They didn't know what
to do with it.


59
0:2:38,12 --> 0:2:41,13
CLAYTON PATTERSON: deVita's
actually extremely important.


60
0:2:41,13 --> 0:2:42,78
Nobody gets it.


61
0:2:42,78 --> 0:2:45,3
But that's the mistake, because
if you don't save that


62
0:2:45,3 --> 0:2:47,5
person's history it
doesn't exist.


63
0:2:47,5 --> 0:2:49,76
THOM DEVITA: And I stopped
going to tattoo


64
0:2:49,76 --> 0:2:52,6
shops after a year.


65
0:2:52,6 --> 0:2:57,102
Every shop I went in, I'd
tell them I'm deVita.


66
0:2:57,102 --> 0:2:59,532
And they never heard
of deVita.


67
0:2:59,532 --> 0:3:2,448
You walk out like you're
an idiot, you know?


68
0:3:2,448 --> 0:3:3,698
Who the hell is deVita?


69
0:3:3,698 --> 0:3:6,35



70
0:3:6,35 --> 0:3:9,7
-And now they're honored
to have you.


71
0:3:9,7 --> 0:3:11,64
THOM DEVITA: No,
let me finish.


72
0:3:11,64 --> 0:3:15,72



73
0:3:15,72 --> 0:3:17,936
You'll have to go in
with the camera.


74
0:3:17,936 --> 0:3:19,385
CLAYTON PATTERSON:
Yeah, I know.


75
0:3:19,385 --> 0:3:21,8
THOM DEVITA: I like
photography.


76
0:3:21,8 --> 0:3:23,249
-You hate filmmakers?


77
0:3:23,249 --> 0:3:26,53



78
0:3:26,53 --> 0:3:28,0
-Who is the cameraman
representing?


79
0:3:28,0 --> 0:3:29,742
THOM DEVITA: I don't know.


80
0:3:29,742 --> 0:3:32,84
He just walked in.


81
0:3:32,84 --> 0:3:34,705
No, he's doing something
on me.


82
0:3:34,705 --> 0:3:36,528
-We're doing a documentary
about Thom.


83
0:3:36,528 --> 0:3:39,444



84
0:3:39,444 --> 0:3:40,902
-Who is the video--
the documentary?


85
0:3:40,902 --> 0:3:42,85
-It's for Vice.


86
0:3:42,85 --> 0:3:45,5
-So are you a part
of Vice, Thom?


87
0:3:45,5 --> 0:3:46,72
THOM DEVITA: Vice squad?


88
0:3:46,72 --> 0:3:47,18
-Yeah.


89
0:3:47,18 --> 0:3:50,54
THOM DEVITA: No, in New York
City the vice squad were the


90
0:3:50,54 --> 0:3:54,97
police who arrested prostitutes
and [INAUDIBLE] of


91
0:3:54,97 --> 0:3:55,31
vice.


92
0:3:55,31 --> 0:3:56,44
-Oh, that goes way back.


93
0:3:56,44 --> 0:3:57,31
I see what you're saying.


94
0:3:57,31 --> 0:3:58,37
Not vice.


95
0:3:58,37 --> 0:3:59,62
All right, yeah.


96
0:3:59,62 --> 0:5:59,62
