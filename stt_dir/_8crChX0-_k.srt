0:0:1,52 --> 0:0:9,43
The talent is, at the end of the day, what
will differentiate the successful companies


2
0:0:9,43 --> 0:0:15,869
from the non-successful ones. The talent has
to be much more open to innovation today.


3
0:0:15,869 --> 0:0:24,36
Have to be much more open to risk-taking today.
And I think also open to failure. And companies


4
0:0:24,36 --> 0:0:28,33
don't like to hear that, but the truth is
you could try ten things. Well, if one of


5
0:0:28,33 --> 0:0:32,8
them works, that’s a good thing. If nine
of them don't – I always think of the story


6
0:0:32,8 --> 0:0:37,29
about how when Babe Ruth, when he got up to
bat, most of the time he struck out. But he’s


7
0:0:37,29 --> 0:0:43,48
the most famous baseball player probably that
ever existed. So I think we have to have talent


8
0:0:43,48 --> 0:0:53,489
today that is tuned into human behavior, consumers’
lives, is tuned into wanting to provide services


9
0:0:53,489 --> 0:0:59,829
and products and brands that fulfill those
lives, and a real understanding of risk taking.


10
0:0:59,829 --> 0:1:3,67
And it’s okay. It’s okay, and I think
we have to allow for that as organizations.


11
0:1:3,67 --> 0:3:3,67
That’s a hard thing to do.
