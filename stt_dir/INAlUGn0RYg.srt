0:0:4,96 --> 0:0:7,51
SHANE SMITH: Chernobyl,
it's empty now.


3
0:0:7,51 --> 0:0:8,788
You know that, right?


4
0:0:8,788 --> 0:0:9,64
Because they had the reaction.


5
0:0:9,64 --> 0:0:11,616
PELLA KAGERMAN: Yeah, I know.


6
0:0:11,616 --> 0:0:14,6
SHANE SMITH: They had a bad
reaction to radiation.


7
0:0:14,6 --> 0:0:15,91
So it's totally deserted.


8
0:0:15,91 --> 0:0:17,96
But then all the wolves
and the bears came.


9
0:0:17,96 --> 0:0:21,15
So you've got three-eyed wolves
and five-legged bears


10
0:0:21,15 --> 0:0:22,54
that are in Chernobyl now.


11
0:0:22,54 --> 0:0:23,47
So we're going to go.


12
0:0:23,47 --> 0:0:24,26
And we're going to hunt them.


13
0:0:24,26 --> 0:0:26,13
PELLA KAGERMAN: But
is this serious?


14
0:0:26,13 --> 0:0:28,145
SHANE SMITH: Yeah,
it's serious.


15
0:0:28,145 --> 0:0:30,65
MALE SPEAKER: It's the 20th
anniversary of the meltdown of


16
0:0:30,65 --> 0:0:32,86
the Chernobyl reactor, which
was the biggest nuclear


17
0:0:32,86 --> 0:0:34,71
catastrophe in human
history besides


18
0:0:34,71 --> 0:0:36,18
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.


19
0:0:36,18 --> 0:0:38,35
Even now, there's an area the
size of Great Britain that's


20
0:0:38,35 --> 0:0:39,13
still radioactive.

0:0:55,39 --> 0:0:58,57
Europe, too, they come up to
you with little wagons of

have that.

36
0:1:37,77 --> 0:1:38,78
Neutron.


37
0:1:38,78 --> 0:1:45,1
We're in Chernobyl, which was
apparently 600 times worse


38
0:1:45,1 --> 0:1:46,54
than Hiroshima.


39
0:1:46,54 --> 0:1:51,61
The only guys that survived here
were the firemen, because


40
0:1:51,61 --> 0:1:54,81
they were bombed when they were
putting out the fires.


41
0:1:54,81 --> 0:1:57,65
It's the same as the doctors
in Hiroshima.


42
0:1:57,65 --> 0:2:0,1
They lived because
they got drunk.


43
0:2:0,1 --> 0:2:1,86
So we've been drinking,
haven't we, Pella?


44
0:2:1,86 --> 0:2:2,837
PELLA KAGERMAN: Yes.

0:2:10,789 --> 0:2:14,11
SHANE SMITH: There's a lot
of people living here.


47
0:2:14,11 --> 0:2:16,75
There's a whole city here.


48
0:2:16,75 --> 0:2:17,25
Look.


49
0:2:17,25 --> 0:2:19,191
That's not good.


50
0:2:19,191 --> 0:2:20,25
YURI TATARCHUCK: Some
people work here,


51
0:2:20,25 --> 0:2:21,74
some people live here.


52
0:2:21,74 --> 0:2:23,14
SHANE SMITH: But isn't it
dangerous to live here?


53
0:2:23,14 --> 0:2:24,85
YURI TATARCHUCK: Actually, this
territory was evacuated


54
0:2:24,85 --> 0:2:27,25
in 1986, after the accident.


55
0:2:27,25 --> 0:2:32,55
But in the period of time from
1986 to 1988, more than 1,500


56
0:2:32,55 --> 0:2:34,42
people came back here.


57
0:2:34,42 --> 0:2:36,898



58
0:2:36,898 --> 0:2:40,67
After the explosion of 1986,
April 26, on the reactor unit


59
0:2:40,67 --> 0:2:43,98
number 4, it was made decision
to evacuate.


60
0:2:43,98 --> 0:2:47,66
April 27 was the date of the
evacuation of Pripyat town.


61
0:2:47,66 --> 0:2:49,68
And later in the week,
it was evacuated


62
0:2:49,68 --> 0:2:50,95
neighborhood villages.


63
0:2:50,95 --> 0:2:52,885
And afterwards, it was
established Chernobyl


64
0:2:52,885 --> 0:2:53,77
exclusion zone.


65
0:2:53,77 --> 0:2:57,61
Average level of radiation in
Chernobyl nowadays is 35 micro


66
0:2:57,61 --> 0:2:58,9
roentgens per hour.


67
0:2:58,9 --> 0:3:2,51
And the natural background we
consider from 12 to 20.


68
0:3:2,51 --> 0:3:3,65
SHANE SMITH: So it's double.


69
0:3:3,65 --> 0:3:4,28
YURI TATARCHUCK: It's
double, yes.


70
0:3:4,28 --> 0:3:5,8
SHANE SMITH: What's going
on here, now?


71
0:3:5,8 --> 0:3:8,66
YURI TATARCHUCK: They hunted
some animals just to


72
0:3:8,66 --> 0:3:11,51
investigate what's going on,
what processes are going on,


73
0:3:11,51 --> 0:3:13,3
what kind of mutation
or changes


74
0:3:13,3 --> 0:3:14,4
are possible in nature.


75
0:3:14,4 --> 0:3:15,69
SHANE SMITH: Were there a
lot of mutant animals?


76
0:3:15,69 --> 0:3:18,475
YURI TATARCHUCK: It was very
clear that some species are


77
0:3:18,475 --> 0:3:19,212
very contaminated.


78
0:3:19,212 --> 0:3:26,86

79
0:3:26,86 --> 0:3:28,93
SHANE SMITH: Apparently,
I have radiophobia.


80
0:3:28,93 --> 0:3:32,93
Radiophobia is when you come
to Chernobyl, people think


81
0:3:32,93 --> 0:3:35,14
that they get a sore throat, or
their eyes water, or they


82
0:3:35,14 --> 0:3:36,36
have diarrhea.


83
0:3:36,36 --> 0:3:38,83
And it's not because of the
actual radiation is infecting


84
0:3:38,83 --> 0:3:39,71
you with cancer.


85
0:3:39,71 --> 0:3:41,77
But it's because you think
you're afraid.


86
0:3:41,77 --> 0:3:43,2
It's all psychosomatic.


87
0:3:43,2 --> 0:3:45,282

This is [INAUDIBLE].

0:3:48,56 --> 0:3:49,83
This is going to help us live.


90
0:3:49,83 --> 0:3:54,98



91
0:3:54,98 --> 0:3:57,37
So that used to be
a whole village.


92
0:3:57,37 --> 0:3:58,45
And they buried the village.


93
0:3:58,45 --> 0:3:59,31
YURI TATARCHUCK: Right.


94
0:3:59,31 --> 0:4:2,87
The big elements of the houses
were buried there on the side


95

going bananas, dude.

SHANE SMITH: We're at 400?


99
0:4:12,9 --> 0:4:13,85
This is the reactor
that blew up.


100
0:4:13,85 --> 0:4:15,56
MALE SPEAKER: So that's
all concrete, right?


101
0:4:15,56 --> 0:4:16,97
YURI TATARCHUCK: No.


102
0:4:16,97 --> 0:4:20,19
The northern wall, for
example, is concrete.


103
0:4:20,19 --> 0:4:25,38
And as for the western wall,
it's made of metal.


104
0:4:25,38 --> 0:4:26,67
And the roof, also metal.


105
0:4:26,67 --> 0:4:27,67
SHANE SMITH: What happened?


106
0:4:27,67 --> 0:4:28,67
Why did it blow up?


107
0:4:28,67 --> 0:4:29,56
What went on?


108
0:4:29,56 --> 0:4:30,984
YURI TATARCHUCK: First
of all, it was the


109
0:4:30,984 --> 0:4:32,298
construction of reactor.


110
0:4:32,298 --> 0:4:34,865
SHANE SMITH: It was the
Russians, those bastards.


111
0:4:34,865 --> 0:4:35,77
YURI TATARCHUCK:
It was Soviet.

0:4:35,77 --> 0:4:36,71

113
0:4:36,71 --> 0:4:38,946
YURI TATARCHUCK: It wasn't
Russian or Ukrainian.


114
0:4:38,946 --> 0:4:39,83
Was Soviet!


115
0:4:39,83 --> 0:4:40,825

119
0:4:44,935 --> 0:4:50,16



120
0:4:50,16 --> 0:4:53,22
SHANE SMITH: This is the
radioactive town of Pripyat.


121
0:4:53,22 --> 0:4:55,88
And apparently, there's wolves
and bears living in these


122
0:4:55,88 --> 0:4:57,99
buildings now.


123
0:4:57,99 --> 0:4:59,52
And they're not mutated.


124
0:4:59,52 --> 0:5:0,49
They're changed.


125
0:5:0,49 --> 0:5:1,48
There's no mutations.


126
0:5:1,48 --> 0:5:2,73
They're changes.


127
0:5:2,73 --> 0:5:12,205

YURI TATARCHUCK: Look, we can
see the civil defense.


129
0:5:15,175 --> 0:5:17,7
These procedures were
never used.


130
0:5:17,7 --> 0:5:20,11
SHANE SMITH: So if there was a
meltdown or a war, you'd just


131
0:5:20,11 --> 0:5:21,47
put a mask on and--


132
0:5:21,47 --> 0:5:23,14
YURI TATARCHUCK: And you
escape to the shelters.


133
0:5:23,14 --> 0:5:24,95
SHANE SMITH: Are there
shelters here?


134
0:5:24,95 --> 0:5:27,8

any kind of a basement.

0:5:33,635 --> 0:5:37,482
SHANE SMITH: As you can see,
not so different from us.


137
0:5:37,482 --> 0:5:40,881
They liked to play some
basketball, some volleyball,


138
0:5:40,881 --> 0:5:43,683
maybe a bit of track.


139

how to attack,


141

oh, that's amazing.

How to spot what different
kind of plane,


144
0:5:54,1 --> 0:5:56,78
F-111, B-52, F-14.


145
0:5:56,78 --> 0:5:58,345
Nuclear energy is the
future, then.


146
0:5:58,345 --> 0:5:59,874
YURI TATARCHUCK: I think yes.


147
0:5:59,874 --> 0:6:3,3
SHANE SMITH: If this is the
future, then we're fucked.


148
0:6:3,3 --> 0:6:12,12



149
0:6:12,12 --> 0:6:14,457
YURI TATARCHUCK: This amusement
park was planned to


150
0:6:14,457 --> 0:6:16,85
open on the first
of May, 1986.


151
0:6:16,85 --> 0:6:19,264
So it was never opened.


152
0:6:19,264 --> 0:6:21,23
SHANE SMITH: This is what
happens when we play with


153
0:6:21,23 --> 0:6:22,64
technology we don't
understand.


154
0:6:22,64 --> 0:6:25,68

we measure, and it shows


155
0:6:25,68 --> 0:6:27,68
average 100, 150.


156
0:6:27,68 --> 0:6:28,94

158
0:6:29,74 --> 0:6:30,61

not too much.

SHANE SMITH: 200.


162
0:6:35,115 --> 0:6:37,49
YURI TATARCHUCK: On the
soil, under the snow,


163
0:6:37,49 --> 0:6:38,2
there is the most.


164
0:6:38,2 --> 0:6:39,75
SHANE SMITH: Why here so much?


165
0:6:39,75 --> 0:6:41,7
YURI TATARCHUCK: It's mostly
under the snow.


166
0:6:41,7 --> 0:6:44,73
Mostly, it's absorbing all this
dust and this radiation.


167
0:6:44,73 --> 0:6:46,91
SHANE SMITH: It's at
fucking 600, dude.


168
0:6:46,91 --> 0:6:48,66
YURI TATARCHUCK:
More than 600.


169
0:6:48,66 --> 0:6:50,54
Without snow, it's 1,500.


170
0:6:50,54 --> 0:6:51,76
SHANE SMITH: Really?


171
0:6:51,76 --> 0:6:53,51
Did you see that fucking
thing there, dude?


172
0:6:53,51 --> 0:6:56,55
The thing went up to 800.


173
0:6:56,55 --> 0:6:58,12
800 is bad.


174
0:6:58,12 --> 0:6:59,27
800 is very bad.

1,300, 1,275.


177
0:7:7,27 --> 0:7:9,75
SHANE SMITH: We bribed
our guide to get


178
0:7:9,75 --> 0:7:11,16
some machine guns.


179
0:7:11,16 --> 0:7:13,74
And we're going to hunt the
radioactive wild boars.


180
0:7:13,74 --> 0:7:16,24
Now, what we have to do
is be very quiet.


181
0:7:16,24 --> 0:7:18,5
We're in a deserted building.


182
0:7:18,5 --> 0:7:19,67
And we have to wait
a little bit.


183
0:7:19,67 --> 0:7:21,335
And when we see the wild boars--
there's hundreds of


184
0:7:21,335 --> 0:7:24,225
them with big fucking toothed
fangy things.


185
0:7:24,225 --> 0:7:26,33
And when we see them, we're
going to shoot them with

machine guns.

0:7:27,284 --> 0:7:35,91
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]


188
0:7:35,91 --> 0:7:38,4

at the boars, they ran into


189
0:7:38,4 --> 0:7:39,16
the forest.


190
0:7:39,16 --> 0:7:40,82
And me and Pella go running
after them.


191
0:7:40,82 --> 0:7:42,86
And they're like,
no, no, no, no.


192
0:7:42,86 --> 0:7:44,98
If you go in there-- it's
called the red forest.


193
0:7:44,98 --> 0:7:47,18
It's the most radioactive
place on earth.


194
0:7:47,18 --> 0:7:49,17
And if you go in there,
you're going to die.


195
0:7:49,17 --> 0:7:51,84
You really feel like this
is the apocalypse here.


196
0:7:51,84 --> 0:7:55,93
There's no fear of death because
everything is dead.


197
0:7:55,93 --> 0:7:57,91
The ground will kill you.


198
0:7:57,91 --> 0:7:58,94
The water will kill you.


199
0:7:58,94 --> 0:8:0,5
The trees will kill you.


200
0:8:0,5 --> 0:8:2,26
My shoes are radioactive
right now.


201
0:8:2,26 --> 0:8:3,86
The beasts are fucking--
they show no fear


202
0:8:3,86 --> 0:8:6,66
