###5 We're talking about anthropology tonight. From the point of view of a scientific approach to the problem.
###11 And so heres how anthropology might be viewed as a scientist might look at it.. some scientists.
###19 We would look at a culture.. Does anyone have any ideas?
###22 Of what might be done. What you think, the methods might be. Want to guess that?
###27 Yes try it.
###28 Man: A possible comparison to some other known system.
###31 Yes.. thats the way you do it.
###33 What you do is you take an area, we'll take a rough idea of an island.
###39 And we'll put a tribe here.
###41 Now we'll say "well they eat fish and use this area of water for fishing"
###45 They... they pick their crops in this area of the forest.
###51 Then they get their root plants in this area of the forest.
###55 And they make their boats, they get their building material from this area of the forest.
###59 Then they get their water from this area.
###62 And so.. This is the area of resource supply.
###65 Then you deal with the population, how many people exist you know.
###70 Then you draw functional connections between the tribe and its real physical need.
###75 Water.. food.. fish.
###79 You draw all of those things
###81 Then you measure the amount of work done to accumulate a pile of food so high.
###87 Anyone doesn't understand that?
###88 You got 100 people and you put out so many man hours to gather the fruit and the bananas.
###94 You measure the efficiency ratio of the tribe.
###97 That is.. how much work they had to do to get a potato.
###100 If you had to walk over the hill and plant the seeds, and take all day to bring it back.
###104 Thats a hell of a whole lot, you use up a potato and a half of energy to get a potato.
###108 So.. we measure the efficiency of how much energy they put out to get the job done.
###113 But if you're dying of thirst.
###115 And you looked up and theres a canteen of water on top of a mountain or desert.
###120 To get up there you use two canteens of water within your body..
###124 ..to get that canteen of water, so you don't go up there in the first place.
###127 So what happens is that you measure these activities.
###130 The next thing you measure..
###132 is activities superfluous to the task at hand.
###136 Now..
###138 We measure activities superfluous to the task at hand.
###142 Now heres what that means. Does anyone want to volunteer what they think that means?
###147 What are activities superfluous in task?
###150 Man: Just general entertainment, amusement by (?)
###153 Yes thats superfluous in..
###154 The task.. the task is to eliminate (?) Yes thats superfluous in..
###155 The task.. the task is to eliminate (?)
###157 Does anybody else want to say anything to that?
###160 I'll tell you what that means.
###161 That means if you go out to fly a kite one day, you ever fly a kite?
###167 And you get ordered and you get on the bus and go all the way out there and then it rains.
###171 Badly, heavily.
###173 And you say oh darn it, fiddly-dee or shit whatever you say.
###178 That doesn't stop the rain.
###180 And that would be activities more than necessary to fly a kite. You don't need it.
###186 But if you just got a flat tire and you say "god dammit I just had a tire and I bought it." and all that.
###191  ...get on out of your car and put the other tire on. That would be essential.
###196 And if you can afford it, you pick up the phone and say get down here and change the tire.
###200 You put it on somebody else's back, and you use money to pay them off, that's another way.
###205 Now you measure all of those factors.
###208 Then you take their beliefs.
###210 They believe that the potato was put there by the water god..
###213 ..because the water god was angry at the banana god..
###216 the banana god made it rain on Wednesdays. And that made this god mad.
###221 And all of that bullshit is what we call cerebral clutter of the tribe
###226 You think you know what I mean?
###227 They build up a lot of cerebral clutter.
###230 Thats is.. they talk to their bananas.
###233 And they talk to...
###236 they placate the sea, they go down and they hope that the sea wont be bad next year and generate tidal waves.
###242 And you build up non essential verbal clutter.
###244 Okay?
###246 Now!
###247 Then you add up the efficiency of one island against the other.
###250 because when you go to another planet, and I say "What kind of society do they have?"
###254 What is the efficiency ratio of the society?
###257 If they have this much arable land area
###259 And they maintain a population that can eat off that. They are alright.
###266 If they let that population too many people grow, there wont be enough bananas to go around.
###268 They have to maintain some sort of eco-balance. Alright.
###273 Now the folk ways...You know what that means?
###275 Who marries who and what ceremonies you do when a guy dies, bury the arrow heads and his fur.
###282 And you bury his favorite hat with him.
###285 That would be depriving a tribe of some possibly useful equipment.
###291 We talk about that in terms of energy expenses toward a non-functional gain.
###297 Now, are there any problems with that kind of thinking in relation to anthropology?
###301 I didn't go into at all which I'm going to any more.
###304 I would like to know whether you would like to raise questions about that now.
###308 Man:Is there any importance in it, whats the importance of anthropology?
###311 Whats is the what?
###312 Man: I there any importance to anthropology?
###316 Is there any importance?
###317 Man: whats the point of doing this?
###318 Well the point is, it deals with the evolution of culture.
###322 So in the study of man and his technological climb.
###327 Okay? you draw the technological climb and then you draw this line.
###332 This non-technological climb; religion, superstition, hanging plastic Jesus in your car.
###338 You draw all the non technological..
###341 The technological thing. The non technological are downward trends. You see that?
###346 In other words. If you have a machine that doesn't work too well and you yell..
###350  ..its better to pick up a can of oil and oil it. Because that means standing there and yelling.
###354 So that would be technological.
###356 Technological is where you break a leg, then you make a crutch out of wood.
###361 That would be a technological solution.
###363 But sitting under bay leaves for three months under the sun..
###369 Doesn't really help cure your broken leg. That would be patterns unrelated. Is that alright?
###375 Now if I send you in a submarine on an expedition and some of the cable..
###383 Those gadgets they lowering in to the water the spheres , they lower them into the ocean depths?
###389 A mile down.. and all that cuts the cable. It falls deep into a trench.
###395 And you say "Oh geeze I hope I can get out of here."
###399 Because they don't.. A ship.. that lowers you into the sea..
###403 doesn't have 67 other bathyspheres and rescue equipment also included in the expedition.
###409 They also don't have a bathysphere joined by an airlock.
###414 And another bathysphere joined to that and another joined to that, separate units.
###419 That would drop together and if anything goes wrong you could climb into other units.
###424 That would be redundancy, safety. Does that make sense to you? Extra gas in the car, whatever.
###429 So instead of lowering some poor bastard to the bottom of the sea.
###433 You do it redundantly with additional safety equipment, ok. We get back to anthropology.
###440 Then you try to find out why they worship the guava instead of all the other fruits.
###448 And they say once he came sick and we were out of food, and we fed them guava and they got well.
###453 You can find out how these customs came to be. How it is that we evolve certain language habits.
###460 And then we you deliver the information through anthropology, you just show charts.
###465 And you show their music.. And you show this, for example I mention this many times in sessions.
###472 So the great plains Indians of the west have dances they do around the fire.
###478 And the dance I indicated is this.
###480 (Fresco Stomps)
###482 Theres a bird, a turkey, kind of a turkey that walks like that. Did you know that?
###486 And that's where they got the dance, so you show all of that.
###490 And you show how all of their customs, you try, this is a very difficult job to do..
###494 Try to link up the connections of their customs and the major influences that primary effected those customs.
###502 You want some paper to draw on of any kind?
###504 Man: No
###504 Alright.
###505 So we show all that, and then that way we build a chain
###509 Linking early systems of society and the technological growth..
###515 And the primitive growth how it, they go through all the technological society.
###519 As we come to say 1914. We have a pretty high degree of technology, even in 1914.
###525 But you show how the superstition and the folkways still come from the primitive tribes and have clung to that society.
###532 And you try to show how it is that 20th century man even then he walks on the moon
###538 may take a plastic jesus with him on the moon.
###541 You show how it is that he does that.
###544 What the factors are that makes him do that.
###547 Does anybody here the things they know?
###549 Why a man in the space age would spit on his telescope and wish him a lot of luck?
###555 People do that occasionally.
###557 Man: Positive thinking, using the most positive attitude.
###561 Does that mean he may not have a positive attitude?
###564 He has a degree of uncertainty.
###565 Man: He's uncertain he my be negative.
###567 Uncertainly sometimes may cause that as the prime effect to carry on habits.
###573 Uh.. even back then, they weren't very useful.
###576 They weren't useful to the tribe, but you cant take them away. Thats something you can't do.
###581 Alright, now this is a description of anthropology.
###584 Now what do you feel that description may lack, at least compressed or other things we talk about?
###591 Man: It doesn't contain any.. its like studying economics or political science. Those things don't contain any solutions.
###596 Oh! We don't consider the early stages of man with a solution in mind.
###603 When we say..When we go to uh.. If I go to New Guinea, I go to some place, I go to a Seminole Indian village.
###610 They don't send me there to modify the village.
###613 The school says "go on and study the customs of the Seminole Indians".
###618 Now, the Seminole Indian. Well one of the arguments I had with this anthropologists,
###622 She said that primitive people were happier than we are in our technological civilization.
###628 Well I asked her whether not she could show me anything that indicates that.
###633 The reason I said that they were not, she said "do you have any evidence to show me that they are not?"
###637 And I said that uh.. If they hand you the pipe of peace, I come as a friend...
###642 Then you say "I don't smoke its bad for the lungs but i agree with you that peace is essential"
###646 They don't sit back and say "well thats your custom, thats interesting as long as you come with the same intention".
###651 They have no shades of gray. If you don't drink their bowl of fly soup when they offer it to you
###658 If you push it away, you've offended the chief.
###662 But I'm sure if people came from another planet and we offered them some meat and they said "we're vegetarians"
###668 "whip up some fresh vegetables"
###673 We would not be offended. So primitive people tend to project a hell of a lot.
###677 Man: What happens Sometimes is you got stress.
###680 Man: I mean, if one wants to use a level of stress in their lives as a measure.
###685 Man: Might, under certain circumstances some primitive people might be better﻿ off and it might depend on the tribe under study.
###691 Yes, it might be. It might be but they are not happier because they are primitive.
###697 They may be happier in your sense because they had uh..
###701 They had an island, they had a low population density and a lot of food.
###704 But not because they are primitive.
###706 Primitive means less able to cope with problems.
###710 Before the outrigger canoe a lot of boats would over turn in the sea, a lot of people drowned.
###716 Now, people tell me that the primitives at least worked out the outrigger canoe. I don't think that the primitives did.
###721 I think some primitive worked on the outrigger canoe and the others were supported by that idea.
###726 Some primitives probably invented the javelin, or modified a stick that they throw.
###733 Some primitives may had added the bow and arrow to the tribe. Which could have had enhanced the survival in the tribe.
###739 But happiness is a method. When a primitives wife doesn't behave
###743 he doesn't walk over there and say "Now look if you don't behave we cant get the job done."
###748 So the primitives work it out real well.
###750 When John gets married and he tells you what to do you do it or he'll hang you up by your hair.
###755 You under stand what I mean.
###757 So a lot of primitive tribes are not so free and democratic.
###762 They don't sit around to discuss anything. The witchdoctor says this is the way it is.
###766 And you say "I wonder at that." That is discouraged.
###770 If by happiness you mean from awakening to sleep..
###779 The amount of stress that occurs in that person. Pain is one way of measuring it.
###787 Is the chief happy because he has his javelin in his hut?
###790 We say that happiness is a very interesting thing. Your going to deal with that, I'll try to give you a description of it.
###797 If I were to give you a brand new Mercedes. Lets say.. How old are you?
###802 Boy: 14
###804 Alright. And we worked it out so you could drive it, through town and all that, you're able to do that.
###808 I think you'd be very happy.. for a while.
###811 Then after 3 years you get in your Mercedes and drive it around.
###815 I don't think you'd say"Gosh its nice to have a Mercedes."
###817 Its only the beginning when someone gets you a new toy.
###821 The minute you shove that electric train in your closet. You know what I mean?
###825 When you get a bunch of (?). You gotta know how to (?). You shove them on a shelf (?).
###833 Take them off the shelf a second time, unless you have a goal in mind. You know what that means?
###839 Thats means if Paul makes a boat for me, I sail around in Biscayne Bay, and then I've sailed it in Biscayne Bay.
###847 And I may enjoy doing that weekends. But if he ordered me to do it everyday of my life. I may not enjoy it.
###855 But if i have a goal. I wanted to go to the Exuma islands.
###859 Then I'm going somewhere, and that the journey from here to there may..
###865 have elements in it that make me feel good because I'm getting somewhere.
###870 But if a storm comes that interferes with it. That interferes with the kind of happiness.
###876 Like if you go to see the south seas on a trip. And theres a fog going through the area.
###881 And you're traveling on a boat and they guy says thats Tonga island over there.
###884 You cant see. That would be an interference factor.
###888 So whenever I go on a boat and the guy says its foggy. I go downstairs and leave.
###894 I don't shit now I cant see the islands I came to see.
###897 So through a system of a certain type of maturation in attitudes, the way you grow up and think about things.
###906 If you want to go bicycle riding with the kids and you bike is gone. No one can lend you a bike, it was stolen.
###912 You better go to the roof, instead of staying home saying "shit I can't go, they're all out bike riding"
###918 That is the unhealthy thing to do. Finding something else to do, ok. �
