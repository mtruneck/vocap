ROMAN COPPOLA: Hey.

ROMAN COPPOLA: It's
my pleasure.


9
0:0:30,45 --> 0:0:32,2
EDDY MORETTI: OK.


10
0:0:32,2 --> 0:0:36,25
Where did the inspiration for
"Charles Swan III" come from?


11
0:0:36,25 --> 0:0:38,15
ROMAN COPPOLA: It came
from a few places.


12
0:0:38,15 --> 0:0:42,16
I had done "CQ," which is a
film I'm very proud of.


13
0:0:42,16 --> 0:0:46,8
But the main character is very
internalized, and he's not a


14
0:0:46,8 --> 0:0:50,18
very outgoing or
dynamic person.


15
0:0:50,18 --> 0:0:53,16
Having done that, it would be
fun to do a contrasting kind


16
0:0:53,16 --> 0:0:56,3
of character study, and just
have a character just balls


17
0:0:56,3 --> 0:1:0,3
out, just showy and flashy and
full of verve and panache.


18
0:1:0,3 --> 0:1:2,95
EDDY MORETTI: So Charles
is kind of--


19
0:1:2,95 --> 0:1:4,16
he's just been dumped.


20
0:1:4,16 --> 0:1:9,72
And he and the people around
him like Saul, the business


21
0:1:9,72 --> 0:1:13,27
manager, and Jason's character,
they all represent


22
0:1:13,27 --> 0:1:17,77
parts of a man's relationship
with women and


23
0:1:17,77 --> 0:1:19,1
perspective on love.

ROMAN COPPOLA: Yeah.


25
0:1:19,842 --> 0:1:23,32
EDDY MORETTI: And Saul's
character has this amazing


26
0:1:23,32 --> 0:1:26,81
line, something like, desire
is as close as I'm going to


27
0:1:26,81 --> 0:1:27,69

28

Desire is about as close to
happiness as I'm going to get.

doesn't have any answers or


37
0:2:1,12 --> 0:2:2,9

38

It's sort of an exploration
of those notions.

there's a beautiful thing when

And a lot of the things that I'm
drawn to in my adult life

are things that I have a
connection with as a kid.

I think both "CQ" and this
recent film, "Charles Swan,"


55
0:3:4,12 --> 0:3:9,7
they were both set in a time
that was very vibrant and very


56
0:3:9,7 --> 0:3:10,93

that when I was preparing

much exclusively, and that's

Liam Hayes' music.

When I heard "Whose Blues,"
which is the lead track on


95
0:4:20,939 --> 0:4:24,84
"Fed," which appears in the

96

this movie in that song.

melancholy, very intimate

to that somehow.

really see myself as a writer.

in the case of my film, I'm

In fact, a lot of times when I
was directing on the set, I


169

wasn't even referring to the

during "Apocalypse Now." We

0:8:7,4 --> 0:8:8,74

over those months in the

friend from that age, it just

doesn't go away.

dance, speak Spanish, do it.


203
0:8:39,31 --> 0:8:40,409
EDDY MORETTI: He nails it.


204
0:8:40,409 --> 0:8:40,854
ROMAN COPPOLA: Yeah.


205
0:8:40,854 --> 0:8:41,289
And all that stuff.


206
0:8:41,289 --> 0:8:43,36
So he was sort of
pushing back.


207
0:8:43,36 --> 0:8:46,8
And during all that kind of
public stuff, I just never


208
0:8:46,8 --> 0:8:50,34
wavered in my belief that he
would do a fantastic job.


209
0:8:50,34 --> 0:8:51,215
And I think he does.


210
0:8:51,215 --> 0:8:54,26
And I thought it was kind of
outrageous that there's this


211
0:8:54,26 --> 0:8:56,46
kind of presumption about--


212
0:8:56,46 --> 0:8:59,58
you read something in a tabloid
and sort of don't


213
0:8:59,58 --> 0:9:0,12
understand.


214
0:9:0,12 --> 0:9:3,93
So he's my friend, and so I
defend him in that regard.


215
0:9:3,93 --> 0:9:8,1
But also, he's my colleague and
a very talented one and a


216
0:9:8,1 --> 0:9:9,52
very loyal one.


217
0:9:9,52 --> 0:9:11,26
So I feel that loyalty
towards him.


218
0:9:11,26 --> 0:9:13,69
So anyway, I'm very proud
of his performance.


219
0:9:13,69 --> 0:9:16,5
EDDY MORETTI: His farewell
speech to her is like the


220
0:9:16,5 --> 0:9:20,39
oddest and strangest farewell
speech, because he's not


221
0:9:20,39 --> 0:9:22,0
begging to be with her.


222
0:9:22,0 --> 0:9:26,65
It's almost like he's nostalgic
about the idea of


223
0:9:26,65 --> 0:9:31,91
their love and sad about the
fact that they won't be in


224
0:9:31,91 --> 0:9:32,87
love anymore.


225
0:9:32,87 --> 0:9:36,22
CHARLES SWAN III: You know,
Ivana, I was thinking.


226
0:9:36,22 --> 0:9:37,47
It's kind of a sad thought.


227
0:9:37,47 --> 0:9:40,94



228
0:9:40,94 --> 0:9:45,15
I'll meet someone, and
it won't be you.


229
0:9:45,15 --> 0:9:50,17
And I'll fall in love with her,
and I'll have kids and a


230
0:9:50,17 --> 0:9:51,42
happy family.


231
0:9:51,42 --> 0:9:54,52



232
0:9:54,52 --> 0:9:57,778
And I won't love you
like this anymore.


233
0:9:57,778 --> 0:10:0,44
And I'll miss it.


234
0:10:0,44 --> 0:10:2,9
And I'll miss you.


235
0:10:2,9 --> 0:10:5,1
EDDY MORETTI: Where did that
particular speech come from,


236
0:10:5,1 --> 0:10:5,81
writing-wise?


237
0:10:5,81 --> 0:10:9,71
ROMAN COPPOLA: I was involved
with a break-up that just kind


238
0:10:9,71 --> 0:10:13,7
of was over.


239
0:10:13,7 --> 0:10:16,57
And there was no scene
like that.


240
0:10:16,57 --> 0:10:18,77
So in a way, it probably--


241
0:10:18,77 --> 0:10:23,96
being honest, was a little bit
of a chance to write the scene


242
0:10:23,96 --> 0:10:25,3
that never happened.


243
0:10:25,3 --> 0:10:26,485
CHARLES SWAN III: Goodbye.


244
0:10:26,485 --> 0:10:29,78
EDDY MORETTI: You're not dark.


245
0:10:29,78 --> 0:10:34,11
Your world view on life and love
and the inevitability of


246
0:10:34,11 --> 0:10:39,93
heartbreak and failure and
re-loving someone new seems to


247
0:10:39,93 --> 0:10:43,92
be almost something that you
embrace and celebrate.


248
0:10:43,92 --> 0:10:47,7
And ultimately, the film, it
ends with this amazing, I'm


249
0:10:47,7 --> 0:10:49,64
going to throw the whole,
everything including the


250
0:10:49,64 --> 0:10:51,96
kitchen sink at this last
scene, where all of the


251
0:10:51,96 --> 0:10:52,79
characters are there.


252
0:10:52,79 --> 0:10:54,7
And it's a celebration.


253
0:10:54,7 --> 0:10:58,6
Everyone turns to the camera and
does that awesome farewell


254
0:10:58,6 --> 0:10:58,58
to the audience.


255
0:10:58,58 --> 0:11:0,395
CHARLES SWAN III: I'm Charlie
Sheen, and I played


256
0:11:0,395 --> 0:11:0,92
Charles Swan III.


257
0:11:0,92 --> 0:11:2,575
KIRBY STAR: I'm Jason
Schwartzman, and


258
0:11:2,575 --> 0:11:3,69
I play Kirby Star!


259
0:11:3,69 --> 0:11:6,4
IVANA: I'm Katheryn Winnick,
and I play Ivana.


260
0:11:6,4 --> 0:11:7,435
SAUL: I'm Bill Murray.


261
0:11:7,435 --> 0:11:8,365
I play Saul.


262
0:11:8,365 --> 0:11:9,76
IZZY: I'm Patricia Arquette.


263
0:11:9,76 --> 0:11:10,69
I play Izzy.


264
0:11:10,69 --> 0:11:13,86
LIAM HAYES: I'm Liam Hayes,
and I wrote the music.


265
0:11:13,86 --> 0:11:15,36
ROMAN COPPOLA: I'm glad
that you feel that


266
0:11:15,36 --> 0:11:16,75
way about the ending.


267
0:11:16,75 --> 0:11:22,14
I recognize the things that are
dark and unpleasant and


268
0:11:22,14 --> 0:11:24,26
cause suffering at
the same time.


269
0:11:24,26 --> 0:11:26,31
That's no reason to get down.


270
0:11:26,31 --> 0:11:27,875
There's so many beautiful
things to celebrate.


271
