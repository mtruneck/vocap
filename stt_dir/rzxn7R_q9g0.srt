0:0:1,19 --> 0:0:2,24
STEVE SPANGLER: You know,
certain things in this world


3
0:0:2,24 --> 0:0:3,59
just don't mix.


4
0:0:3,59 --> 0:0:9,28
Oil and water, dogs and
cats, Sonny and Cher.


5
0:0:9,28 --> 0:0:10,57
Giraffes and whales.


6
0:0:10,57 --> 0:0:12,75
Sharp objects and balloons.


7
0:0:12,75 --> 0:0:15,52
I know you haven't given a lot
of thought to this, but it is


8
0:0:15,52 --> 0:0:16,47
pretty fascinating.


9
0:0:16,47 --> 0:0:20,8
What if you could find a sharp
object and a balloon, and make


10
0:0:20,8 --> 0:0:22,5
them live in perfect harmony?


11
0:0:22,5 --> 0:0:23,9
I'm pretty excited.


12
0:0:23,9 --> 0:0:25,87
I think you will be, too.


13
0:0:25,87 --> 0:0:28,34
Failed again.


14
0:0:28,34 --> 0:0:31,535
I'm Steve Spangler, and I'm all
about making science fun.


15
0:0:31,535 --> 0:0:34,56
For the last 20 years, I've
been teaching ways to turn


16
0:0:34,56 --> 0:0:37,58
ordinary science experiments
into unforgettable learning


17
0:0:37,58 --> 0:0:38,59
experiences.


18
0:0:38,59 --> 0:0:41,23
I have an amazing team who will
do whatever it takes to


19
0:0:41,23 --> 0:0:43,96
affect the way people
think about science.


20
0:0:43,96 --> 0:0:46,28
And to do that, I live
by one motto.


21
0:0:46,28 --> 0:0:49,27
Make it big, do it right,
give it class.


22
0:0:49,27 --> 0:0:54,686



23
0:0:54,686 --> 0:0:57,3
Remember that episode where we
took the pencils, and we put


24
0:0:57,3 --> 0:0:59,7
the pencils through
the bag like this?


25
0:0:59,7 --> 0:1:2,35
We called it the
leak proof bag.


26
0:1:2,35 --> 0:1:6,12
The secret was the fact that
this plastic bag is a polymer.


27
0:1:6,12 --> 0:1:8,47
A polymer's nothing more than
this long chain of molecules,


28
0:1:8,47 --> 0:1:11,96
and we literally put the pencil
through this long chain


29
0:1:11,96 --> 0:1:14,52
of molecules, and it sealed
itself back around, keeping


30
0:1:14,52 --> 0:1:15,85
the water from leaking out.


31
0:1:15,85 --> 0:1:18,21
The question today is could
you do the same thing with


32
0:1:18,21 --> 0:1:20,38
another polymer, a
rubber balloon?


33
0:1:20,38 --> 0:1:23,24



34
0:1:23,24 --> 0:1:25,67
See, balloons are made out of
latex, and latex is nothing


35
0:1:25,67 --> 0:1:27,29
more than a long chain
of molecules.


36
0:1:27,29 --> 0:1:29,4
If we wanted to do the same
thing with the pencil through


37
0:1:29,4 --> 0:1:31,93
the bag, you could,
but there's a


38
0:1:31,93 --> 0:1:32,89
problem with the balloon.


39
0:1:32,89 --> 0:1:35,51
It's under so much stress,
and so much pressure.


40
0:1:35,51 --> 0:1:38,6
Watch.


41
0:1:38,6 --> 0:1:40,12
See, most of the time we don't
think about blowing up a


42
0:1:40,12 --> 0:1:43,67
bubble, and think about the
way that the molecules are


43
0:1:43,67 --> 0:1:44,85
oriented here in the balloon.


44
0:1:44,85 --> 0:1:48,1
We just think of blowing a
balloon up, tying it off, and


45
0:1:48,1 --> 0:1:50,92
realizing that any sharp object,
like this cooking


46
0:1:50,92 --> 0:1:54,44
skewer, and the balloon are
two things that don't mix.


47
0:1:54,44 --> 0:1:57,44
See, when we get close here,
these strands of molecules are


48
0:1:57,44 --> 0:2:1,35
stretched so thinly that just a
mere presence of that sharp


49
0:2:1,35 --> 0:2:3,67
object, and it pops.


50
0:2:3,67 --> 0:2:6,54
Let's do it again, but this time
we use a clear balloon.


51
0:2:6,54 --> 0:2:9,669
This is a 9 inch, clear party
balloon that you would find,


52
0:2:9,669 --> 0:2:10,9
like a helium balloon.


53
0:2:10,9 --> 0:2:13,8
But by using a clear balloon,
you get to see some of the


54
0:2:13,8 --> 0:2:15,89
properties of this latex balloon
that you couldn't see


55
0:2:15,89 --> 0:2:17,55
what a colored balloon.


56
0:2:17,55 --> 0:2:21,7
First and foremost, look at how
stretched and clear it is


57
0:2:21,7 --> 0:2:23,27
in the very middle
of the balloon.


58
0:2:23,27 --> 0:2:24,2
You'll notice two things.


59
0:2:24,2 --> 0:2:27,41
You'll notice that there's a lot
of rubber around this area


60
0:2:27,41 --> 0:2:30,43
here that's not stretched
tightly, and there's not a lot


61
0:2:30,43 --> 0:2:32,68
of rubber that's stretched
tightly right here.


62
0:2:32,68 --> 0:2:35,57
So this is the area that's most
like that bag when we did


63
0:2:35,57 --> 0:2:36,79
the pencil through the bag.


64
0:2:36,79 --> 0:2:39,39
The molecules are not
stretched as tight.


65
0:2:39,39 --> 0:2:40,64
They've got a little bit
of give to them.


66
0:2:40,64 --> 0:2:43,9
So if we were ever to try to
take a sharp object and stick


67
0:2:43,9 --> 0:2:46,73
it through, this would be the
point of entry, and this could


68
0:2:46,73 --> 0:2:47,98
be the point of entry.


69
0:2:47,98 --> 0:2:50,51
If we could push it all the
way through, you literally


70
0:2:50,51 --> 0:2:53,38
would do surgery on
a latex balloon.


71
0:2:53,38 --> 0:2:55,3
Now it's time to get
a sharp object.


72
0:2:55,3 --> 0:2:57,7
It's an ordinary cooking skewer,
the kind that you


73
0:2:57,7 --> 0:2:59,48
would find at the
grocery store.


74
0:2:59,48 --> 0:3:2,64
Except this one here, I'm not
going to take any chances.


75
0:3:2,64 --> 0:3:5,7
I want that tip to be
super, super sharp.


76
0:3:5,7 --> 0:3:8,41
So I'm using just a small
amount of really fine


77
0:3:8,41 --> 0:3:11,89
sandpaper to get the
perfect tip.


78
0:3:11,89 --> 0:3:13,1
All right, it's time
for surgery.


79
0:3:13,1 --> 0:3:15,28
If I'm going to try to take this
and put it through the


80
0:3:15,28 --> 0:3:17,66
balloon, I'm going to try to
go through this area here


81
0:3:17,66 --> 0:3:20,93
where it's the greatest amount
of excess latex rubber.


82
0:3:20,93 --> 0:3:25,32
When you push, you push, and
just keep on pushing, making


83
0:3:25,32 --> 0:3:28,25
sure that your hand is at the
bottom, because every once in


84
0:3:28,25 --> 0:3:30,43
awhile, OK, all the
time it will pop.


85
0:3:30,43 --> 0:3:34,65
Watch this as it comes
out the other end.


86
0:3:34,65 --> 0:3:38,4
And that's how you would do
surgery on a regular balloon.


87
0:3:38,4 --> 0:3:39,84
Now, you see that a
little bit of air.


88
0:3:39,84 --> 0:3:40,81
Well, you can't see the air.


89
0:3:40,81 --> 0:3:41,37
I can feel it.


90
0:3:41,37 --> 0:3:42,67
You can sometimes hear it.


91
0:3:42,67 --> 0:3:45,29
A small amount of air
coming out here


92
0:3:45,29 --> 0:3:46,9
as it's coming through.


93
0:3:46,9 --> 0:3:47,78
Of course the air
is leaking out.


94
0:3:47,78 --> 0:3:51,2
So unlike the leak proof bag,
where the water didn't come


95
0:3:51,2 --> 0:3:54,17
out, the air will come out,
and we can slowly start to


96
0:3:54,17 --> 0:3:56,8
pull this back out again here.


97
0:3:56,8 --> 0:3:59,9
You can see the air goes down,
and finally we're at the very


98
0:3:59,9 --> 0:4:1,24
end, and the balloon can pop.


99
0:4:1,24 --> 0:4:3,23
So the secret here is stress.


100
0:4:3,23 --> 0:4:5,52
And let's just use one of
these clear balloons.


101
0:4:5,52 --> 0:4:7,94
Let's use a Sharpie pen to draw
something on the balloon


102
0:4:7,94 --> 0:4:10,8
to see what it looks like
once it's inflated.


103
0:4:10,8 --> 0:4:12,11
In this particular case, just
simple little dots.


104
0:4:12,11 --> 0:4:14,7
We're going to give them
all the same size.


105
0:4:14,7 --> 0:4:18,41
So the goal is to keep all the
dots the same size so we can


106
0:4:18,41 --> 0:4:22,29
compare them once the
balloon is blown up.


107
0:4:22,29 --> 0:4:25,3
So all the dots hopefully are
about the same size, but watch


108
0:4:25,3 --> 0:4:26,92
what happens when you
blow this up.


109
0:4:26,92 --> 0:4:29,35
Take a look at where the latex
is the most stressed.


110
0:4:29,35 --> 0:4:34,34



111
0:4:34,34 --> 0:4:38,19
See, the dots almost disappear
here in this part here.


112
0:4:38,19 --> 0:4:41,89
Look at how big that dot is
compared to the size of the


113
0:4:41,89 --> 0:4:45,45
dot down here, where it's
relatively unstretched.


114
0:4:45,45 --> 0:4:47,98
Is it easy to be able to put
a needle through a regular


115
0:4:47,98 --> 0:4:49,16
balloon where it's
not stressed?


116
0:4:49,16 --> 0:4:50,12
Absolutely.


117
0:4:50,12 --> 0:4:52,12
In fact, that's exactly what
you're doing when you do


118
0:4:52,12 --> 0:4:54,82
surgery at this end, or
the end down here.


119
0:4:54,82 --> 0:4:58,13
Sometimes the edge of the skewer
will catch, and so a


120
0:4:58,13 --> 0:5:0,18
small amount of cooking oil,
or maybe a little bit of


121
0:5:0,18 --> 0:5:3,95
Vaseline, works very well to
help this as the skewer tries


122
0:5:3,95 --> 0:5:7,31
to make its way through the
balloon without popping.


123
0:5:7,31 --> 0:5:9,64
Again, if you were to go
through the part of the


124
0:5:9,64 --> 0:5:11,87
balloon here where it's the
greatest amount of stress,


125
0:5:11,87 --> 0:5:13,22
it's sure to pop.


126
0:5:13,22 --> 0:5:16,68
But this end right here, as
you push, and that small


127
0:5:16,68 --> 0:5:18,53
amount of Vaseline will help.


128
0:5:18,53 --> 0:5:20,27
It's perfect as it
goes through.


129
0:5:20,27 --> 0:5:22,7
You just have to look on the
other end where it's coming


130
0:5:22,7 --> 0:5:26,61
through, and that's the perfect
spot right here.


131
0:5:26,61 --> 0:5:32,533
And it's the perfect
spot right here.


132
0:5:32,533 --> 0:5:37,3
And you can see it's fairly
easy to make that skewer


133
0:5:37,3 --> 0:5:40,67
travel right through
the balloon.


134
0:5:40,67 --> 0:5:41,76
Simple.


135
0:5:41,76 --> 0:5:45,26
So let's say you want to use
this as a metaphor, an object


136
0:5:45,26 --> 0:5:48,61
lesson, attach some sort of
meaning to it other than just


137
0:5:48,61 --> 0:5:49,48
teaching science.


138
0:5:49,48 --> 0:5:52,425
Well, one of the things that
has been easy to do is to


139
0:5:52,425 --> 0:5:54,47
think of this as handling
stress.


140
0:5:54,47 --> 0:5:57,4
If I want to come up against
any stressful kind of


141
0:5:57,4 --> 0:6:0,37
situation, I have to take a look
at the situation first,


142
0:6:0,37 --> 0:6:5,4
and figure out where to enter,
where to get involved, and


143
0:6:5,4 --> 0:6:6,37
most importantly,
where to exit.


144
0:6:6,37 --> 0:6:9,95
And so if I took this volatile
situation that's here, it's


145
0:6:9,95 --> 0:6:11,39
under a tremendous amount
of pressure.


146
0:6:11,39 --> 0:6:15,8
And I guess the needle could be
the source of the problem.


147
0:6:15,8 --> 0:6:19,74
If I try to go here, I'm trying
to do kind of a head on


148
0:6:19,74 --> 0:6:21,11
collision with the problem.


149
0:6:21,11 --> 0:6:22,97
This is where it's the greatest
amount of stress.


150
0:6:22,97 --> 0:6:24,33
And then in negotiation,
it's horrible.


151
0:6:24,33 --> 0:6:26,91
It's like asking mom and dad for
something during tax time.


152
0:6:26,91 --> 0:6:28,72
Ask for nothing during
tax time.


153
0:6:28,72 --> 0:6:30,38
March, bad time.


154
0:6:30,38 --> 0:6:32,45
Christmas time, good
time, right?


155
0:6:32,45 --> 0:6:35,22
So all you're trying to do is to
figure out where the least


156
0:6:35,22 --> 0:6:36,39
amount of stress is.


157
0:6:36,39 --> 0:6:39,27
And if we go in where the least
amount of stress is and


158
0:6:39,27 --> 0:6:42,3
enter the problem, it's pretty
easy to be able to get knee


159
0:6:42,3 --> 0:6:46,2
deep into that situation,
analyze it, try to fix it, and


160
0:6:46,2 --> 0:6:50,66
have an exit point over
here like this.


161
0:6:50,66 --> 0:6:54,95
So as a leadership principle, or
maybe a business idea, or a


162
0:6:54,95 --> 0:6:57,4
way to be able to talk about
counseling or bullying,


163
0:6:57,4 --> 0:6:59,52
whatever it might be, it's
kind of an interesting


164
0:6:59,52 --> 0:7:2,5
illustration, I think, to be
to enter this very volatile


165
0:7:2,5 --> 0:7:6,53
situation with something
that sharp, but you


166
0:7:6,53 --> 0:7:7,86
get the point, right?


167
0:7:7,86 --> 0:7:9,68
That was horrible.


168
0:7:9,68 --> 0:7:11,215
But you're going
to be using it.


169
0:7:11,215 --> 0:7:13,95
Well, back in the 1970s, my
mom and dad bought me this


170
0:7:13,95 --> 0:7:16,5
magic trick called needle
through the balloon.


171
0:7:16,5 --> 0:7:20,5
What you got was this needle,
a super, super long, sharp


172
0:7:20,5 --> 0:7:23,5
needle that you always ended
up poking yourself with,


173
0:7:23,5 --> 0:7:26,53
attached to some ribbon
down at the very end.


174
0:7:26,53 --> 0:7:28,61
Now, there wasn't really
a science explanation.


175
0:7:28,61 --> 0:7:31,5
They just said that the secret
was to enter the balloon


176
0:7:31,5 --> 0:7:34,19
through the end and come out
through the very top, and it


177
0:7:34,19 --> 0:7:36,1
would look as if the
magician had these


178
0:7:36,1 --> 0:7:37,44
extraordinary powers.


179
0:7:37,44 --> 0:7:39,94
But herein lies the problem,
because what was once a very


180
0:7:39,94 --> 0:7:42,98
cool magic trick was no longer
a secret because of people


181
0:7:42,98 --> 0:7:47,98
like Mr. Wizard and Bill Nye,
and Steve Spangler.


182
0:7:47,98 --> 0:7:49,8
Take two.


183
0:7:49,8 --> 0:7:50,4
All right.


184
0:7:50,4 --> 0:7:50,6
Listen.


185
0:7:50,6 --> 0:7:53,4
So, see, throw caution
to the wind.


186
0:7:53,4 --> 0:7:55,53
All the kids know the secret
because of these people on TV.


187
0:7:55,53 --> 0:7:59,93
So what if you could throw
caution to the wind, and


188
0:7:59,93 --> 0:8:2,43
instead of going through this
end here that all the kids


189
0:8:2,43 --> 0:8:5,73
knew about, what if you could go
through the side like this?


190
0:8:5,73 --> 0:8:7,49
So you just poke it right
through the side, where


191
0:8:7,49 --> 0:8:9,6
everybody knows that
it should pop.


192
0:8:9,6 --> 0:8:12,16
And yet, in the hands
of a magician,


193
0:8:12,16 --> 0:8:13,79
this is totally possible.


194
0:8:13,79 --> 0:8:16,75



195
0:8:16,75 --> 0:8:19,76
Try that fancy science
teachers.


196
0:8:19,76 --> 0:8:21,75
But you see, my problem with
magic is I'm not very good at


197
0:8:21,75 --> 0:8:24,16
keeping a secret, and I've got
to tell you how this works.


198
0:8:24,16 --> 0:8:25,8
You just have to
get some tape.


199
0:8:25,8 --> 0:8:26,8
So--


200
0:8:26,8 --> 0:8:27,632
MALE SPEAKER: Mr. Spangler?


201
0:8:27,632 --> 0:8:29,772
I'm gonna need your card.


202
0:8:29,772 --> 0:8:31,22
STEVE SPANGLER: No,
not the card.


203
0:8:31,22 --> 0:8:35,59



204
0:8:35,59 --> 0:8:36,32
My membership card?


205
0:8:36,32 --> 0:8:39,8
MALE SPEAKER: That's the one.


206
0:8:39,8 --> 0:8:41,429
STEVE SPANGLER: Who made
you Captain Magic?


207
0:8:41,429 --> 0:8:42,5
Not all tape works well.


208
0:8:42,5 --> 0:8:44,32
You'll have to do a little
experimenting, but this


209
0:8:44,32 --> 0:8:46,85
packing tape seems to
work perfect for me.


210
0:8:46,85 --> 0:8:50,12
The secret here is to use this
to keep the sides of the


211
0:8:50,12 --> 0:8:52,73
balloon from stretching,
expanding, and


212
0:8:52,73 --> 0:8:53,91
exploding real quickly.


213
0:8:53,91 --> 0:8:56,21
So you blow up the balloon, and
you don't have to use a


214
0:8:56,21 --> 0:8:58,23
clear one for this, but
it's pretty effective.


215
0:8:58,23 --> 0:9:1,27



216
0:9:1,27 --> 0:9:3,48
Again, this is the
dangerous spot.


217
0:9:3,48 --> 0:9:6,5
All the kids who think that they
know this trick know that


218
0:9:6,5 --> 0:9:7,47
you have to go here
and you go here.


219
0:9:7,47 --> 0:9:10,97
So you take a small piece
of tape like this.


220
0:9:10,97 --> 0:9:12,81
You put it right at the
spot where they know


221
0:9:12,81 --> 0:9:15,1
you can't go through.


222
0:9:15,1 --> 0:9:16,24
You put it right there.


223
0:9:16,24 --> 0:9:18,3
That's number one.


224
0:9:18,3 --> 0:9:21,42
And one on the opposite side
would be perfect if you were


225
0:9:21,42 --> 0:9:23,38
going to do the skewer
through the balloon.


226
0:9:23,38 --> 0:9:26,6
Well, you can see that if I show
it to you, by holding it


227
0:9:26,6 --> 0:9:28,88
here like this, it looks
like a regular balloon.


228
0:9:28,88 --> 0:9:29,85
This is great.


229
0:9:29,85 --> 0:9:31,8
All right, let me test my luck.


230
0:9:31,8 --> 0:9:31,88
Watch.


231
0:9:31,88 --> 0:9:34,745
Tape on the side, let's see if
you can do it with the skewer.


232
0:9:34,745 --> 0:9:39,1



233
0:9:39,1 --> 0:9:40,82
This is good.


234
0:9:40,82 --> 0:9:42,6
It's leaking just
a little bit.


235
0:9:42,6 --> 0:9:45,24
You have to go pretty fast.


236
0:9:45,24 --> 0:9:48,89
That's the skewer through the
balloon, and hopefully nobody


237
0:9:48,89 --> 0:9:50,65
knows how it works.


238
0:9:50,65 --> 0:9:51,78
Hey, magic man.


239
0:9:51,78 --> 0:9:51,9
Higginsworth.


240
0:9:51,9 --> 0:9:52,86
Come here.


241
0:9:52,86 --> 0:9:53,85
Look at this.


242
0:9:53,85 --> 0:9:54,53
Big balloon.


243
0:9:54,53 --> 0:9:55,88
I got a magic trick for you.


244
0:9:55,88 --> 0:9:56,1
Watch this.


245
0:9:56,1 --> 0:9:56,42
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I've
seen this one.


246
0:9:56,42 --> 0:9:57,65
STEVE SPANGLER: No, you haven't
seen anything before.


247
0:9:57,65 --> 0:9:58,11
Watch this.


248
0:9:58,11 --> 0:9:58,99
This is the big balloon.


249
0:9:58,99 --> 0:10:0,19
You've never anybody
do it like this.


250
0:10:0,19 --> 0:10:1,81
Look, no tape on it.


251
0:10:1,81 --> 0:10:4,55
And look, no extra rubber
right here.


252
0:10:4,55 --> 0:10:7,12
This is just a huge, it's called
a cloudburst balloon.


253
0:10:7,12 --> 0:10:9,73
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and
girls, pushing the skewer


254
0:10:9,73 --> 0:10:12,47
through the giant balloon.


255
0:10:12,47 --> 0:10:13,72
Here we go.


256
0:10:13,72 --> 0:10:16,92



257
0:10:16,92 --> 0:10:20,8
I never was very good
at that trick.


258
0:10:20,8 --> 0:10:21,71
Could you get the vacuum?


259
0:10:21,71 --> 0:10:22,96
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks for that.


260
0:10:22,96 --> 0:10:25,12



261
0:10:25,12 --> 0:10:26,79
STEVE SPANGLER: So with all of
this sharp objects going


262
0:10:26,79 --> 0:10:27,84
through balloons, I know
what you're thinking.


263
0:10:27,84 --> 0:10:28,84
Maybe it's the air.


264
0:10:28,84 --> 0:10:30,14
What if we change the air?


265
0:10:30,14 --> 0:10:31,31
What if it was helium?


266
0:10:31,31 --> 0:10:33,55
Would that work?


267
0:10:33,55 --> 0:10:37,825
Well, you could use the helium,
and it would probably


268
0:10:37,825 --> 0:10:40,51
work the right way, but nobody
really cares, because you're


269
0:10:40,51 --> 0:10:41,41
just using helium.


270
0:10:41,41 --> 0:10:43,14
Nobody really cares
about that.


271
0:10:43,14 --> 0:10:46,28
But what if we used a gas that
was six times heavier than the


272
0:10:46,28 --> 0:10:47,2
air we breathe?


273
0:10:47,2 --> 0:10:48,39
Sulfur hexafluoride.


274
0:10:48,39 --> 0:10:50,505
Would the needle through the
balloon work the same way if


275
0:10:50,505 --> 0:10:51,755
you use this gas?


276
0:10:51,755 --> 0:10:54,726



277
0:10:54,726 --> 0:10:56,35
Once again, nobody
really cares.


278
0:10:56,35 --> 0:10:59,211
In fact, nobody cared about this
demo until we did it in


279
0:10:59,211 --> 0:11:2,42
2007 on The Ellen Show.


280
0:11:2,42 --> 0:11:6,46
Now it seems to be kind
of a staple with it.


281
0:11:6,46 --> 0:11:8,77
You've gotta get oxygen
back into your


282
0:11:8,77 --> 0:11:10,221
lungs, or you're sleepy.


283
0:11:10,221 --> 0:11:13,658
Don't try this at home, kids.


284
0:11:13,658 --> 0:11:14,908
Higginsworth!


285
0:11:14,908 --> 0:11:27,816



286
0:11:27,816 --> 0:11:31,18
Many people wonder what's magic
about a magic wand.


287
0:11:31,18 --> 0:11:34,91
It has very many powers, like
passing through a solid object


288
0:11:34,91 --> 0:11:35,79
without harming it.


289
0:11:35,79 --> 0:11:39,83
Let me demonstrate with a
balloon and its holder.


290
0:11:39,83 --> 0:11:43,4
We'll put the balloon
in its holder.


291
0:11:43,4 --> 0:11:47,73
And now we're going to stick
the wand right through.


292
0:11:47,73 --> 0:11:48,32
One thing.


293
0:11:48,32 --> 0:11:51,51
Let's add something
to the mystery.


294
0:11:51,51 --> 0:11:55,12
Let's put the handkerchief
over the want.


295
0:11:55,12 --> 0:11:56,37
Now let's stick it through.


296
0:11:56,37 --> 0:11:59,7



297
0:11:59,7 --> 0:12:0,53
Went right through.


298
0:12:0,53 --> 0:12:3,23
Let's pull the want out.


299
0:12:3,23 --> 0:12:5,35
Pull the hank out.


300
0:12:5,35 --> 0:12:8,21
I bet you're saying that it
isn't a real balloon.


301
0:12:8,21 --> 0:12:10,822
Watch.


302
0:12:10,822 --> 0:12:12,49
MALE SPEAKER: I know it's
a real balloon.


303
0:12:12,49 --> 0:12:13,54
MALE SPEAKER: That was
a real balloon.


304
0:12:13,54 --> 0:12:13,84
MALE SPEAKER: Beautiful.


305
0:12:13,84 --> 0:12:14,14
MALE SPEAKER: I liked it.


306
0:12:14,14 --> 0:12:15,39
It was very good.


307
0:12:15,39 --> 0:14:15,39
