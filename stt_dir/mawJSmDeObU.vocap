###117 Let me tell you why you're here. You're here because you know something.
###123 What you know you can't explain, but you feel it. You've felt it your entire life.
###129 That there's something wrong with the world. You don't know what it is,
###133 but itís there like a splinter in your mind driving you mad.
###139 It is this feeling that has brought you to me.
###142 This is your last chance, after this there's no turning back.
###148 You take the blue bill, the story ends you wake up in your bed and believe
###153 whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill, you stay in wonderland
###158 and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.
###172 Remember, all I'm offering is the truth, nothing more.
###190 Follow me.
###194 This isn't real. What is real? How do you define real? If you're talking about
###200 what you can feel what you can smell what you can taste and see then real
###205 is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
###209 It's all about frequency compatibility, vibrational compatibility. If you are in a human
###216 body and you're vibrating to a certain frequency um and here someone wants
###222 to possess that body and is vibrating to a very different frequency, it's very
###227 difficult to make that connection and therefore takeover the mental and emotional
###231 faculties of that human body if you like. If you can create a genetic hybrid
###240 then that vibrational compatibility becomes very much closer and therefore
###245 very much more effective in terms of possession. So what has happened is
###250 there has been this interbreeding which created these hybrid bloodlines and
###256 this is the origin of the divine right to rule. The divine right to rule "what is that?"
###261 It's the right to rule because of your bloodline because of your DNA. So these
###267 hybrids became known  and their known in history as the demi-gods, part human part gods.
###276 Gods were just other dimensional entities. And they became the kings the queens,
###280 the emperors of the ancient world. Who claim this right because of their special bloodline
###287 Royal dictatorship started to be resisted by the people and the royal dictatorship
###293 started to fall. What happened is these bloodlines moved out of overt royal
###301 dictatorship. They're still in there, the Winsorís in Britain and the Spanish
###304 royal family and all these others. But they moved then into what I call the
###309 dark suit professions as they've become. They moved into politics, they moved into
###313 banking and business and all this stuff. They're in there anyway but they moved in much more
###317 powerfully. So when you look at the transnational corporations and the major
###321 and most powerful and influential politicians, and those that control the oil cartel, and the drug
###327 cartel and all the rest of it, you're looking at this hybrid bloodlines. In effect, it's a software program
###333 if you want to see the body as a computer as I do. And you want to know who they
###338 are because you know if you got this bloodline itís like a computer program
###344 or a computer in the sense that you got files in your computer but they donít affect the screen
###349 the reality unless you open the file. So you go through life and these files don't affect you,
###356 but there are certain ways that you can open these files and then bring that perception, that attitude
###363 that behavior that personality of that file onto the screen. In other words, in the way
###372 people behave in everyday life. And they do this with the secret society ritual.
###379 This is why they'll target someone, the person won't realize why they've been targeted.
###382 They might thing that "Oh they just think I'm good and they're supporting me
###387 and sponsoring me." Powerful people suddenly sponsors people to progress
###393 very quickly in law or politics, or stuff. People like Blair is a classic.
###399 And then as they progress through this sponsorship and support, they get pulled
###408 into the secret society network is all part of it, and then they go through
###411 the secret society initiation rituals which often they have not a clue what they're about.
###416 They're just rituals are they. Just tradition. But what's happening is these rituals
###421 that are designed to tease open these files which they know they've got cause
###424 they've got the bloodline in there. And then as these files open so they have more
###428 and more effect on the personality, the screen of the person involved and there personality
###434 changes. And you watch this classic example, you can see it around the world. You
###441 watch people who for instance come into politics with a certain sometimes genuine
###447 desire to change things and then eventually, as they progress into power, they
###458 become absolutely everything that they entered politics to challenge. And It's
###466 not always for this reason, but many times it is this reason that as this genetic
###472 files have been opened, more and more and more, suddenly it's affecting their
###477 personality and they're now becoming a behavioral perception expression of this
###484 hybrid DNA. And they start to operate with that hybrid DNA in terms of their behavior
###490 and attitudes. DNA databases now allow a highly sophisticated way of finding out
###499 who's got the bloodline and who hasn't. Everybody is broadcasting, vibrating
###504 to a certain frequency. Were in the same frequency range, otherwise we couldn't
###509 see each other, but there's subtle differences between everybody, we always have
###513 our unique vibrational code. If you know what that code is, and if you want
###520 target that person with vibrational interference on a physical, emotional and
###525 mental level, mind control I'm talking about with the latter one. Then you can target
###531 them specifically on their unique frequency. Once you have the DNA you can
###537 work out what that frequency is, so that's another reason why they want
###543 DNA database. It's not for catching criminals, they arenít interested in catching
###549 criminals. Criminals for them are just other ways, the highest level I'm
###554 talking about, are just other ways to justify more and more control to protect
###557 the people from criminals. They don't want a society that without crime without
###560 violence without terrorism, is worst nightmare. How do you impose an Orwellian
###566 State on a society of harmony? You can't do it. You can only do it on a society that
###571 is divided and ruled and in fear of everything. That's why we have the society we do.
###576 Watch US television fawning Fox CNN CBS all of them ìOH it's so wonderful, no one in America
###583 can wait until next week." The way they're hyping it.
###591 One week until the royal wedding this is an exciting stuff I mean itís hard to
###593 I mean the energy is just palpable.
###596 Young couples get married they're just hoping that some bank will be nice enough to
###599 give them a mortgage. These folks have a number of palaces to pick from.
###602 NBC news is launching a free Royal Wedding App for the I pad.
###606 This is truly a love story that captures everybody's attention.
###611 This goes back to Edward Bernays a hundred years ago saying look, to make politicians
###616 and royalty popular we'll have Hollywood stars come to banquets and events with them.
###620 We'll have music stars, we'll have other people go there to basically make these
###624 elites be seen as celebrities themselves.
###652 In the books of the Tibetan Contour
###656 The contour consists of over a thousand volumes containing the holy texts of
###661 Lamaism. The resulting translations are full of references to gods appearing in the sky. Of aluminous
###667 pearls and transparent spheres in which they lived.
###672 The search for humanities first possible contact with alien beings in prehistoric times leads
###678 to an unlikely place, to the bibles earliest chapters, to the book of Genesis.
###685 There were giants in the Earth in those days. And also after that when the sons of God
###691 came into the daughters of men and they bore children to them. Genesis 6-4
###701 While most English bibles use the word giants, the original Hebrew word is Nephilim.
###710 In translation of the word Nephilim is the men who came down or those who came down meaning
###718 those who came down from the sky. So it may not mean that they are physical giants. They
###725 could just be something like great heroes that came down from the sky and produced a hybrid race.
###731 If you say that Jehovah is an ET then that changes the basis of Judaism and Christianity
###737 in a very fundamental way.
###739 For many ancient Christians the book of Enoch was essential yet it was banned from the
###745 Christian bible.
###747 We don't know why this literature was ultimately excluded from the canon perhaps itís because
###752 of its description of the fall of the rebel angels and their mating with mortals. Perhaps
###759 it's understanding of the End of Time fell out of favor with Jews and Christians.
###766 As with the story in Genesis, God blames this evil on the sons of God. Angels who
###772 lusted over the daughters of man.
###775 These angels are sometimes referred to as watchers they keep constant watch and they decide
###780 one day, about 200 of them that theyíre going to descend to the Earth.
###786 They would like to very much make contact with these mortal women.
###793 The book of Enoch may have been an attempt to expand on the mysteries giants, the sons
###797 of God and the daughters of the Earth spoken of in Genesis.
###803 Anytime you read the book of Genesis there are all kinds of unanswered questions
###807 Suddenly there is this quick few verses in the beginning of the flood story about giants in the
###812 land that come from the sons of God mixing with the daughters of the Earth and you stop and
###817 think wait a minute what's this all about. It's like it went by too fast and you want to grab it
###822 and say wait a minute what was this.
###824 And they began to go into them and defile themselves with them and taught them charms
###833 and enchantments. And they became pregnant and they bore great giants who's height was
###837 three thousand elves. And when men could no longer sustain them the giants turned against
###841 the men devoured mankind.
###850 That these angels had crossed this boundary that they shouldn't have when they decided
###854 to descend upon Earth, this unleashed upon the Earth all sorts of problems. Not only
###858 these giants who are blood-thirsty and violent but also these angel went on to teach human
###863 kind a variety of forbidden crafts. They also taught human beings how to make weapons of war.
###870 The Maya and Incas of South America believed a race of giants existed on Earth before the
###875 great flood. So did many other ancient civilizations. Some took them for gods others left
###884 likenesses of them in stone or wrote about them in their histories.
###889 As long as six thousand years ago another remarkable civilization evolved. It's people were the
###895 Sumerians who had an extraordinarily advanced culture.
###900 There lists of first just almost sounds like a whole list of our whole society. They had the first
###908 bicameral congress, they had the first writings, they had the first school systems and you know
###913 and you just go on and on and on. So you have to ask where did all this come from and I think
###920 that you need to turn to the ancient Sumerians themselves and listen very carefully to what they
###925 have to say because what they have to say not just in one place but over and over and over again
###930 is that they were taught civilization by these beings that came from the heavens to the Earth
###938 And the pictorial evidence left behind by the Sumerians going back six thousand years speak and
###946 depict a people who came from another planet I call Nibiru. And many of the depictions show
###955 them much bigger at least by a third more than the average human beings so they were giants.
###965 This Sumerian cylinder seal is astonishing for several reasons.
###972 First it depicts our solar system with the sun at the center and planets arrayed around it.
###978 A fact not known to European science until around 300 years ago.
###984 And amazingly there's another planet, which the Sumerians called Nibiru and believed that it
###990 was from where the Anunaki or celestial giants came from.
###995 The ancient Sumerian text in a very broad overview basically tell us that more than 400 thousand
###1003 years ago that these Anunaki came from space and landed on the Earth in the Tigers Ufraties valley.
###1012 They began to set up a colony that they called E-den.
###1019 According to Genesis, E-den or Eden is where Adam was created from dust and Eve from one
###1026 of his ribs. Others however have a more hi-tech version of how human life began.
###1035 In time needing men-power needing workers jumped the gun on evolution using genetic
###1044 engineering and they produced a hybrid.
###1048 Legend has it that when the Anunaki came back after several thousand years to see how
###1053 their genetic handiwork had turned out, they found the Earth females irresistibly attractive.
###1062 Thatís us. Basically the Anunaki said in their writings that the Sumerians left behind, we should make
###1068 the Adamove, they called their slave servant Adamove plural which comes to us now in the
###1074 bible as the Adam. We should make the Adamove in our own image after our own likeness and
###1079 they did that Now wait a minute are you saying that we
###1085 the modern race of people were genetically engineered by a super-human race of aliens
###1089 that came from another planet and that we look like them. In the cylinder seals
###1094 that we have the five thousand or so cylinder seals that we have out of the Sumerian culture
###1098 depicting gods and humans on the same cylinder seal at the same time they always look
###1103 the same. How did we lose 2 chromosomes all primates have 48 chromosomes we have 46
###1109 that is an awful a lot of DNA where did it.. if you read the Sumerian text the Anunaki flourished
###1114 from around 400 thousand years ago and by the way they called their where they lived in the Tigers
###1119 Ufratis valley the E-den. That was their word for where they lived
###1124 Well we've heard Adam and we've heard Eden.
###1127 Well it turns out a lot of the old testament is an attempt to rewrite the Sumerian Epics
###1132 of creation cause they were considered the guys with the word.
###1135 We have to break here.
###1136 And these ancient cultures they all have their stories of this interbreeding between a
###1143 reptilian race, and itís not all reptilian but it seems to be a predominant factor, and humans.
###1149 In fact, the ancient emperors of China used to claim the right to be emperor because of their
###1156 descendants from the serpent gods. Everywhere you find this reference in different phrases and names
###1163 to the serpent gods.
###1166 And out of here the Sumer, Egypt, Babylon area came some of the most significant bloodlines
###1176 which then moved up across the world to become the ruling controlling families of today.
###1373 In 1851 in what is now known as Iraq, archeologist and explorer Sir Austin Henry Leyard
###1380 discovered a library of 22 thousand tablets containing what know to be the earliest writings
###1385 on Earth. The writings date back to over 6 thousand years ago when the region was known as
###1389 Mesopotamia, Sumer, and Babylon. Amongst these vast writings is a story that mirrors
###1394 the book of Genesis in the bible. It tells a story of a great flood which reshaped the face of
###1399 the planet Earth and all her inhabitants. It tells a story of a tower built at the creation of
###1404 the spoken word.
###1405 In Japan emperors claim decent from dragon gods that came from the sky. Australian aborigines
###1412 teach of a reptilian race that lives underneath the Earth and governs over man. They believe they are
###1418 descendants of a race of dragon humans. China teaches the serpent queen Nukua interbred with man
###1424 India calls these reptilian gods Nagas, and claim they seeded their royal families. Throughout
###1431 the middle east it is believed a serpent race created man. The book of Genesis tells of giants
###1436 who came from the heavens to breed with the daughters of man. There called the Niphilim.
###1441 In Africa they call them Chitari, children of the serpent.
###1446 The royal kings of Africa claim decent from serpent gods who came from the sky.
###1452 In South America the Mayans teach that their ancestors were the people of the serpent.
###1457 Aztecs were said to be created by a serpent woman.
###1460 In America the Hopi Indians believe sky gods came to Earth to breed with their women and
###1466 refer to them as their snake brothers. The word Su means snakes, and iracoi means serpents
###1474 It seems the only places you will not find this historical story is where the history has been
###1479 methodically destroyed.
###1483 The descendants from king Anu in Sumeria and Babylon can be traced throughout time.
###1489 The pharaohs of Egypt were from the bloodlines of the Babylonian kings. The rulers of the
###1495 Roman Empire can be traced to Egyptian hierarchy. All throughout Europe the royal families
###1503 can be traced back to the great roman emperors. 34 of the presidents of the United
###1510 States are directly descendant from European royalty with the remaining 8 who are only closely
###1514 related to these same bloodlines. In 1934 president Franklin D Roosevelt placed the great
###1520 seal originally created in 1782 by the freemasons, on the dollar bill. Represented in the great
###1526 seal is the pyramid and the all seeing eye known to be used by the illusive society the Illuminati
###1533 Strung together in conspiratorial confusion are secret societies such as the Illuminati, the freemasons
###1538 and the bohemian club. In 1917 national geographic did a story on a place in Monte Rio California
###1545 called Bohemian Grove. The story reports a place where worldís elite members of the Bohemian
###1551 Club retreat to in late July and conduct and ancient occult ceremony called the cremation of care.
###1558 The alter is at the base of a 200 foot owl the Babylonian symbol of the god Molech, the god of
###1563 human sacrifice. In the video, a body is delivered up river where it is set on fire.
###1570 Upon being aired members of the bohemian club reported that the ceremony is a put-on
###1575 merely done for entertainment and fun. This history tells a story of our world leaders having
###1580 a deep involvement in Satanic tradition, worshiping our reptilian overloads, serpent gods.
###1588 It poses the possibility that we may be and have always been enslaved by our leaders
###1593 no different than sheep or cattle. There is an endless amount of information that supports
###1599 this. But donít take my word for it.
###1602 Members of the major religious organizations, how are they conspiring together towards a
###1606 global agenda, in your opinion  Well I donít think that 99.9% of people in the religions are conspiring
###1615 together, but if you go high enough to those that ultimately control those religions thatís when the
###1622 conspiracy comes in. And very very few understand those connections because it's essential to the
###1634 conspiracy unfolding unchallenged for even those that are making contributions to it everyday
###1643 not to realize that thatís what theyíre doing. So they structure everything and religion is exactly
###1650 the same, as pyramids compartmentalized pyramids. So if you look at the any organization today
###1657 including Christianity or Islam or any of it, theyíre structured as pyramids and pyramids within pyramids
###1663 so the vast majority are in the body of the pyramid and they have been manipulated to believe that
###1671 their religion is true and their God is the only God, and all that stuff. And their truth is the only truth
###1678 and everyone else must be wrong and then you keep going up and up and up and up and right at the top
###1684 of the pyramid you got the tiny few people who are actually orchestrating the whole deal. And they understand
###1690 that the religion the religious belief in whatever religion it is, is just a front for something else.
###1700 And that something else is the something else behind all at least all the major religion a lot of the non-
###1711 major religions, so Christianity and Islam and Judaism and all that stuff ultimately come from the same
###1720 source and are controlled by the same source. So if you go back to the ancient world and you pick up the
###1728 sun-god moon-goddess religion which was predominant around the world you will have Christians
###1737 and Muslims and stuff that would reject them, the goddess sun god religion that actually their religions
###1746 are just another version of it. There just hidden behind different names and behind different structures
###1755 but behind itís the same thing. If you look at the way they depicted for instances just a throw away thing,
###1762 the way they depicted the sun-god and the moon-goddess in the middle east thousands of years ago
###1771 itís the international symbol of Islam today, the moon and the star the sun. if you look at the background to
###1779 Christianity you see that Jesus was just another version of the sun god like mythra and tamos in Babylon, and
###1788 so many others dyonisis, Bacchus, the same story was told about them thousands of years before Christianity
###1795 that was told about Jesus, they've just put the story in another historical setting and changed the names.
###1801 And Jesus is a symbol for the sun, this is why what was said about him and the way he's depicted is a mirror
###1810 of the way they depicted Horus, the symbol of the sun in ancient Egypt. How they did for Tamus, symbol of the
###1818 sun in ancient Babylon. And wherever you go you find that these religions are different versions of the sun-god
###1829 moon-goddess religion which is the religion of those who are conspiring to bring about this Orwellian state.
###1838 Then you go a step further and you look into these rituals in freemasonry and the background to freemasonry
###1846 and other secret societies that connect into it. Like the Jesuits etc.,  just look at the Jesuits logo itís a sun.
###1855 And you find again and again in freemasonry that one of their prime symbols if not the prime symbol is the sun.
###1864 And so what you're looking at within the secret societies is another version of the ancient sun-god moon-goddess
###1874 religion which is their focus of worship, which is the same focus of worship when you look behind the cover
###1882 story of these major religions, and yet the major religions certainly Christianity on the surface condemn
###1889 freemasonry and all that stuff, and yet theyíre all different masks on the same face, and so again when you
###1899 take the pyramids up, the compartmentalized pyramid, and you reach the top you find that the same few
###1907 what they call elite families, interbreeding families, bloodlines are controlling Christianity, Judaism, Islam, freemasonry
###1916 Hinduism, you look at Hinduism again they are worshiping the same gods from the Vedic history as is
###1928 worshiped in other forms by the western religions. And so itís one religion including the secret societies
###1938 but the religions at the base of the pyramid where people see them in society are presented in different
###1946 a way but itís all the same score and its all the same gods that they are and you know you go back to
###1953 the original writings for the bible itís not talking about a singular god that came in the translation, they're
###1960 talking about gods, and so are the Hindu religions and all the rest of it. So were looking at the same structure
###1972 in belief and worship thatís packaged in different ways. And Of course once you re-package it, then you can play
###1980 the different packages off against each other, dividing and rule the general population as religions
###1985 fight and they argue and all this stuff over whoís right and i got the truth and you've not got the truth,
###1990 And up there theyíre on their kind of on their backs with their legs in the air absolutely in hysterics whatís
###1996 going on down here cause they know itís all the same thing theyíre arguing about. And of course
###2001 if you look at religion itís been used in such a massively effective way in terms of advancing this agenda.
###2012 First of all you go divide and rule which any small group trying to control a massive group has to divide and rule
###2020 a massive rule to have any chance of success. But theyíre also selling belief systems which are different
###2028 packages of the same belief system and those belief systems when you take them on they close the mind
###2036 down and they wall off they firewall off the mind because anything outside of the belief system must be
###2043 wrong so they wonít look at it so youíve turned someone into a person of tunnel vision and tunnel
###2050 belief. and what we believe we perceive, we edit reality by based on what we believe and you can see this
###2059 because you know when youíre having a conversation with someone who has a real preconceived belief
###2066 about you and youíre having a conversation and youíre saying things to them and you siting there and you
###2073 say "I never said that! I never said that" "Oh you did you did"
###2078 Because what's happening is, you are saying things and it goes through the belief of the receiver
###2087 the 'preconceived belief about you' system and it edits what's coming in by the time they consciously
###2094 hear it. They are hearing what youíre saying in a way that confirms and underpins their preconceived
###2103 belief about you. And so once you take on a rigid belief you edit your reality  and perception
###2111 through that belief. So Christianity goes into Africa, it goes into Australia, it goes into North America
###2118 and it destroys or as much as it could the thousands of years of knowledge and understanding
###2125 that has been passed through that culture and imposes upon it the rigid beliefs of Christianity.
###2131 Therefore taking out, because anything that was not about the rigid beliefs of Christianity
###2138 "Itís the devil" you know. I mean Credo Mutwa the Zulu shaman in south Africa, great great friend
###2143 of mine wonderful wonderful man. He was beaten silly as a kid for depicting Jesus as a black man.
###2152 In a painting you know and he tells the story of how the Jesuits and all these people went into Africa
###2161 and it became a crime to talk about or certainly to believe the ancient African knowledge thatís
###2175 come through the centuries through the shamanistic screens, and destroying the ancient knowledge
###2181 of reality of history which we really to have access to to get another fix on how we can look at the world
###2192 and history in a different way, outside of the official history which has been written simple to get people to
###2201 see the world and where weíve come from in a way that suits the agenda, so religion is just a fantastic
###2207 weapon for this conspiracy we're talking about.
###2211 And there is corruption even amongst the family of prophet Mohamed because unfortunately
###2218 like it happened with Jesus, like it happened with Moses, like it happened with every single messenger
###2223 of life on this planet, the day after they're dead they already start making their own way making their
###2231 own changes to the religion to manipulate whatever the message was and adapt it to their own you know
###2238 their own situation. I mean these messengers obviously come for a specific mission.
###2245 Well the next thing on from the connections between religions and secret societies and the gods that
###2253 they worship is Satanism because that's just another arm of this. This might be controversial to the
###2261 believers in the religions and stuff youíve got the ancient gods which were translated into God
###2270 which are worshiped by the religions unknowingly most of them. Same with the secret societies and the
###2277 same "gods" demonic entities as theyíre called in this case that are worshiped by the Satanists are the same
###2284 gods that are worshiped by the secret societies and the religions unknowingly, in Satanism its knowingly
###2293 and these gods these non-human entities operate just outside the frequency range of human sight what is
###2304 known as visible light, itís so important for people to understand that when they look through their eyes their
###2310 not seeing everything that exists in the space theyíre looking at, we call space anyway, theyíre looking at
###2316 merely a tiny frequency range that our five senses can access. Itís like a television station, itís like a holographic
###2325 television station, and its sharing the same space as all the other realities what increasingly the cutting edge
###2334 of mainstream science is calling parallel universes, see each other thereís a wireless internet in this room
###2341 but were not aware of it, but you get a computer and you tune it into that wireless internet suddenly
###2347 out of the ether out where comes the internet on your computer screen, and this physical form
###2353 this body computer as i call it tunes us in to a certain frequency range which is what we perceive through the
###2361 five senses but in the same space are other frequency range other dimensions of reality which are sharing
###2369 the same space, now most of the time were not aware of them just like television stations are not aware
###2375 of each other but of course in a situation you might tune into a radio station and its very very close to another
###2384 station you get interference where the two radio stations interact with each other and thatís what can happen
###2394 with these realities where thereís another reality thatís really really close on the frequency scale, there can
###2400 actually be a crossing over between the two, and a satanic ritual one of the reasons they do it one of them
###2408 is to create an energy environment through the way a ritual is conducted which allows like a vibrational window
###2417 a doorway to open which allows these entities to enter the ritual. I've talked to endless people around
###2425 the world who've seen this, actually experienced this suddenly this seriously horrible often entity looking
###2434 entity appears in the so-called magic circle which is a vibrational field thatís what it is. You know they
###2441 donít use these pentagrams and stuff just for fun, some of them might the lower ones who don't really
###2446 understand it but the ones who are really involved that understand the way reality works and how you can
###2450 manipulate it these pentagrams and these various symbols used in Satanism, like the reversed pentagram
###2459 is the classic satanic symbol and the circle around it, they are vibrational fields thatís why they do these
###2467 rituals and the entity can enter this reality the range of visible light in other words what we can see
###2476 within that vibrational field and suddenly the gods appear. These gods as they're perceived feed off human
###2486 energy, they feed off low vibrational human energy, low vibrational emotional energy all round based
###2493 on fear, stressed, hatred, guilt, all these things these low vibrational emotions and another way they feed
###2502 off human energy is by human sacrifice. What they do in the sacrifice is they'll have the victim and they'll
###2512 go through this ritual and they build up the ritual to gain maximum terror from the victim so now there's
###2521 tremendous energy not just of fear, but of absolute terror and then the point of sacrifice that energy is
###2531 released massively and these "gods" that are operating just outside human sight, feed off of that energy
###2539 because that terror that low vibrational energy represents the energy field that they are vibrating to and
###2548 therefore they can absorb that energy, they can't absorb the higher dimensional energy they have to have low
###2552 vibrational energies. Look at society its structured to create massive fear, stress all these things from the
###2560 population and its feeding these quote gods and that enters the bloodstream at the point of sacrifice
###2566 and then these sick people drink the blood cause itís got that adrenaline it gives them this rush
###2573 what shocked me when i started to understand this and investigate this was the scale of it the SCALE
###2581 is astonishing, and thereís people in America who've been involved their careers and things like the FBI
###2589 investigating it in America and one of them said it is on such a scale Satanism that if you have a reasonably
###2596 wide circle of friends, associates and acquaintances you will know Satanist who's involved in this stuff.
###2604 Now when you start relating this stuff to history you come across this common theme everywhere of making
###2615 sacrificial offerings to the gods of animals and of young virgins the young virgins sacrificed to the gods you
###2625 find it everywhere. Of course in places like the Aztec period in central America they were doing it bloody on
###2633 mass thousands of sacrifices and what was that? It was merely what is happening today. Is prepubescent
###2643 pre-sexual activity energy. Thatís why they want children. Thatís why you had the young virgins sacrificed,
###2651 they were kids! that's why they do it today for this very reason, and there are certain points where there are
###2662 vortexes within the Earth energy field and these vortexes as they spin theyíre basically places where the
###2672 connection between this dimension and other dimensions is much thinner much closer because of the nature
###2679 of the vortex. Itís basically spinning two dimensions together in affect and so if you do the rituals on these
###2688 vortexes then it is much easier energetically to manifest and bring out these gods into manifestation the other
###2698 thing about the vortexes is is they are points where lots of, the big vortexes anyway, where lots of lay lines,
###2706 meridian lines, energy lines, cross so what you do on those lines for a start is sourced by very powerful energies
###2718 cause basically you got electricity grids coming in from the point of several directions to where youíre doing the
###2725 ritual so youíre dealing with a powerful energy field which is what you want to achieve your outcome and also
###2734 what you do at that point in terms of the energy that you create of hatred and terror and all these things that then
###2747 goes through these lines from that point and youíre actually affecting the global grid by doing that. In terms of
###2755 places where this goes on I can only talk about people that I've spoken to and things that I've
###2765 come across. Certainly a lot of the major royal palaces are built on these prime sacrificial spots.
###2779 In the first years of the 21st century
###2786 a third world war broke out
###2790 those of us who survived knew mankind could never survive
###2800 a fourth
###2803 that our own volatile natures could simply no longer be risked.
###2812 So we have created a new arm of the law. The grammaton cleric
###2821 whose soul task it is to seek out and eradicate the true source of man's inhumanity to man
###2834 His ability
###2838 to feel
###2839 When the shadows, the whole world is controlled by the same force. Is that which is able
###2848 to understand the way the human computer works, the way the human mind works the way
###2854 the human emotions work that hidden shadow level that center of the web level they know
###2861 that this is all an illusion that this is a holographic illusion it only exists in our head and
###2866 therefore they can manipulate what we think our emotional state and how we see the world
###2874 and ourselves because they understand how the computer works. It's basically like if you get
###2882 a new personal computer you stick it on the desk you donít know anything about computers
###2889 what do you do? you know you turn it on you might find an on switch and flip it about a bit
###2895 you might find this and open this and oh whatís this... itís all very limited. And then a computer
###2901 programmer walks in who knows absolutely how that computer works and he can do anything
###2907 on it. That analogy sums up the human plight in the sense that this is a holographic biological
###2920 computer and the vast majority of people in the world have no idea it's even a computer
###2926 never mind how it really works and where theyíre thoughts and emotions are coming from and how
###2931 theyíre manifesting reality but the spider in the center of the web does and it has structured society
###2939 it has structured communication, it has constructed the information that we are receiving in the
###2946 computer which were downloading to impose upon us a completely false reality that allows us to be
###2955 computer like sheep rather than the infinite genius we really are if we could only break out of this
###2969 computerized control thatís being imposed upon us. So the spider is not operating at the same level
###2976 of knowledge as we are, not least because although this knowledge existed in the far ancient world
###2983 the spider has manipulated events so that knowledge has been sucked out of mainstream society
###2992 and held only by the few that pass it on through the highest and i mean highest levels of the secret
###2997 society networks and so making people aware of this knowledge of the nature of reality the nature
###3009 of who we are is fundamental to setting people free of the control that theyíre being subjected to
###3019 because you know we can work on the level of banking scams, political scams, manipulated wars,
###3027 manipulated 911s and we should because we need to know that but if thatís all were doing in terms
###3036 of communicating knowledge then basically were operating in a cycle of this is the problem but how
###3045 the hell do we get out of this. We will never know how to set ourselves free until we understand the nature
###3058 of who we bloody-well are. How do you set yourself free if you donít even know who you are? How do you set
###3066 yourself free when you donít even know the nature of reality that youíre living in and manifesting and making
###3070 happen without your knowledge that youíre making it happen, you cant. So alongside the information about
###3077 the five sense level of this conspiracy if you like, we have to just as powerfully i would say more powerfully
###3088 communicate the nature of reality and how we are creating our reality and how we are allowing it to be
###3095 created for us by having ourselves programmed with certain beliefs and certain perceptions all the time
###3101 the two must go together otherwise, were never going to get out of this. and uh.. so itís a big task to get this
###3111 stuff out but, because youíre not telling people anything you donít already know. If I tell you that thatís a computer
###3121 and you're infinite consciousness I'm not telling you anything you donít already know. Iím telling you what youíve
###3126 forgotten because what happens is you come into this world and with this knowledge suppressed. It's like
###3134 someone once said, can you imagine you come into the world and someone tells you that 2 and 2 equals 5
###3142 your parents tell you that from an earliest age 2 and 2 equals 5 you then go to kindergarten and nice teachers
###3149 tell you that 2 and 2 equals 5. You then go to school and teachers junior school senior school they tell you
###3157 2 and 2 equals 5. By now all your mates have been through the same system theyíre telling you 2 and 2 equals
###3164 5 and if you say it equals 4 they laugh at you. You then go to university, professors with letters after their names
###3170 mustaches, they say 2 and 2 equals 5 you know, oh no it equals 4, noooo Iíve been doing this for fifty years
###3182 I've met all the best brains in the world, it equals 5 that boy will not go far. And then you turn the tele on
###3193 "hey good evening, 2 and 2 equals 5... now the weather" right? Um.. Thereís a good chance that you'll go through the
###3201 whole of your life believing 2 and 2 equals 5 but it still equals 4. And when, and what this information of the nature of
###3208 reality is doing, basically its saying "do you remember 2 and 2 ... 4" "OHHH YEESSS" and this is why this has such an
###3217 impact on people when they are.. they hear it something goes "this is true ahh this is true" because theyíre remembering
###3227 it. We are in a world in which the vast majority of the population is in an amnesic state, they are in a hypnotic
###3238 trance because they have been implanted with false information about themselves and the world ever since they arrived.
###3249 Sat around a table and you said "right what we need to do is we need to find some way of getting young people
###3260 to see the world in the way we want them to see it so by the time they become adults they are completely following
###3268 the reality we want them to believe in" someone might say "well they might not have it like, but you know the ideal thing?
###3278 what we do is we have a system where we take children away from their parents at least five days a week all day from about
###3286 the age of four and five and we have control of their minds until theyíre about seventeen eighteen, that would be ideal"
###3295 But of course that's what happens itís called the education system and its indoctrination. We have two hemispheres
###3302 in the brain, the left brain which is about words and this world reality and you know the perception of this reality
###3311 we have the right brain which is where you get creativity, inspiration, and connection and then you got this corpus
###3317 callosum with connect the two. First of all we use the fraction of our brain why is that? And the other thing is is what
###3327 the system does is it turns out left brain prisoners they run the system and it does it by putting information through
###3337 schools and colleges and universities into the left brain which it then says at time of an exam "give me all that back
###3347 and if you tell me what Iíve told you well enough to believe then you'll pass the exam and you'll be very successful"
###3356 anyone that takes that information into the right brain and puts their spin on it or questions it or sees through it
###3363 and puts that in the exam they are perceived as a disruptive influence in the classroom and so what happens is for
###3377 you to become a doctor, overwhelmingly a politician, a journalist, someone often in industry, all these areas that
###3392 control the system the professions the professions, lawyers I mean on and on we go
###3401 you have to of gone through your young life constantly taking information into your left brain and regurgitating it
###3410 out on exam papers. To become a teacher you have to go through that process then you go through teacher training
###3418 college where youíre taught how to do it to others, then you let loose on the children. The whole system is run by
###3425 left brain prisoners and if you look at the school system things like music and art that stimulate this side of the brain
###3432 the uniqueness they are constantly cut back in favor of left brain curriculums. And this is systematic, I have to get
###3444 this over to people, this is not systematic at the level of you know people who administer it into reality. It is
###3451 coldly calculated in the shadowy areas where these concepts first come from and they know what theyíre doing.
###3465 Yea these examinations, whatís happening is that you know to fit in to be part of the so called in crowd you have to
###3470 reconfirm the beliefs of the hierarchy.
###3474 You know when youíre watching the teli (TV) your mind goes into the same brainwave state as you do in a hypnotic
###3480 trance and what happens when youíre in a hypnotic trance with a hypnotist? He plants subliminal subconscious messages
###3490 which implant a false reality "Oh the audience is laughing but what theyíre laughing at? This is an apple I can taste it"
###3499 Itís a potato "no its a potato" the implanted belief is itís an apple so thatís what you are getting. Now symbolically thatís
###3508 whatís happened to the world. The human population is eating a potato thinking itís an apple because theyíve been told
###3515 from birth to death itís a freakin apple, it isnít.
###3519 People think that hypnosis is some mysterious esoteric thing, and itís not itís just simply a mental transaction
###3530 in which a person has focused their attention, theyíve stopped being critical and theyíre more open to suggestion
###3541 If someone is looking for people to hypnotize they know that 85 out of 100 are going to be able to go into some level of trance.
###3552 Hypnosis is a natural way of inducing a trance like state and we all have the ability to enter into trance.
###3560 At many times during every day of our lives we slip into trance-like states where we become absorbed in watching the Television.
###3572 The first order of business for a propagandist or an advertiser is to create the circumstances that will induce a state of mind
###3580 that is favorable to the reception of their message and that state of mind is the hypnotic state of mind making television
###3586 extremely important in this whole process of creating the unified mind-set amongst the entire population.
###3596 Television is a massive massive... Mass hypnotist to the global mind, and what happens is it is implanting a belief
###3608 in reality by the minute and then once we take on that belief implanted when information enters the eyes we edit
###3620 it on the basis of that belief and so what the global population is subjecting or is subjected, to suffering from, is
###3631 actually literally mass hypnosis and when people, when we talk about people who start to see things see the manipulation
###3641 they couldnít see before, what do we say about them? what do they say about themselves?
###3645 "I woke up!" exactly what theyíve done. When people start to go "hey I can see it now" itís like someone has gone
###3653 along like the hypnotist and clicked their fingers and itís like "oh i can see it now" mass hypnosis and that
###3660 is the greatest hypnotist on the planet, and thatís the basis of why it was created.
###3667 [TV] "forty nine unidentified man went berserk last night..." Where does she get her view of
###3670 the world? Who will be her role model? What values will she have? Who's child is she?
###3682 Yours or the networks?
###3690 Take back your children
###3693 turn off the TV
###3696 And when you start to research the subliminals in advertising and television what staggers you is not
###3704 what they do and whatís there, but the scale of it... our consciousness is being hit by an explosion of this stuff
###3711 because you see this is a very interesting point. Experiments have shown that about one and a half seconds
###3717 before the conscious mind decides to take action and moves its arms or whatever, speak, one in a half seconds
###3725 before it consciously decides to do that the electrical signals have begun in the brain to do it
###3730 For me the conscious level is the experiencer and observer of reality but the subconscious is the creator of it
###3741 the generator of it and this is why the illuminati want the subconscious mind through subliminals. What does
###3746 subliminals mean it means below threshold, itís below the threshold the conscious mind picks up but the
###3752 subconscious mind picks everything up like a sponge, and therefore they are planting these thoughts into the
###3758 subconscious which then filters down into the conscious and we think weíre having our own thoughts when actually
###3762 theyíre implanted thoughts done at a subliminal level If you think about it whenever you hear
###3769 news broadcasters speak you realize that their speak pattern is similar to the pattern-speech of the hypnotist
###3779 the news broadcaster looks directly into the camera and directly into the eyes of the viewer, another hypnotic trick
###3786 Terror experts are working around the clock to head off any new attempt to attack America and theyíre concerned that
###3793 in the not so distant future terrorists could easily blend in with the US population. Bob Wore now on Al-Qaidaís
###3801 latest tactics. US officials are increasingly worried that the next attack on America could be carried out by American
###3810 branded terror. Report will be released here in Washington tomorrow. It concludes that homegrown terrorism
###3817 is the rise in this country and one of the most significantly contributing factors remains the internet. My question for
###3821 you is this, I heard that on the 17th of this month George passed the executive order that says if you protest the
###3833 Iraqi war you could have your assets [cut] Oh sorry about that, sorry to cut you off uh.. balloon town Connecticut
###3845 Without these key elements in their history the children were being socially engineered into another direction.
###3856 So weíve got several generations now where this kind of social engineering has perpetuated through the school systems
###3865 fortunately there are a number of people who became aware of this particularly when Bill Benet was the secretary
###3871 of education and had said that every child in this country should be taught by a Jesuit. The Jesuits are the intelligence
###3881 arm of the Vatican and was very much corrupted to bring what Adolf Hitler said was a way to mass mind control of
###3893 generations. It was Adolf Hitler who said that if there were any free thinkers in society he wasnít concerned because
###3903 he had control of the minds of the children through the education system. That was something that I heard bill Benet
###3912 quote himself in the application of the global education into this system... been head of our senator associations comity
###3923 which means that he decides how money is going to be spent and how itís going to be delegated and he has made sure
###3932 that more and more statesí rights are lost in favor of federal intervention and that was how global education was brought
###3940 into the school systems as state rights were overwritten. Mark and I just returned from Europe, like he was saying
###3948 we spoke in Germany and that was quite an experience and to see so many people who had been affected by
###3959 mind control directly who have seen it in their own families who are acutely aware of what social engineering is
###3968 in society. They know whatís happening in the United States theyíve been talking about it for years that I'm aware
###3979 of particularly on the education aspect because it was exactly what Hitler had implemented and they were recognizing
###3987 it. They were also recognizing also the erosion of our medical system and how we were becoming more and more
###3993 financially dependent in this state, and losing more and more of our individual rights to information control but the
###4008 compassion of people not only in Germany but all over the world where mark and I have been speaking out is very
###4016 encouraging. To go outside this country is like a whole new world. I mean itís such a privilege to see that people are
###4024 awake and aware. They know what mind control, they know that mind control has a firm grip on America right now
###4034 that there is a criminal faction in control of our government that is seeking to control the world and its inexcusable
###4045 that we continue to follow leaders that we didnít elect. We know that these people that are in place right now
###4055 werenít elected. They keep taking the elections. Consider that the electronic voting machines were manufactured by
###4065 key corporation one of the among the very very few that are actually controlling the media. They also manufactured
###4076 our voting machines and Dick Chaney is associated with that corporation much the same way is with Halliburton.
###4087 At that time George Romney was the governor of Michigan and he was very much interested in taking a very powerful
###4096 form of mind control gleaned from the Catholics taken from the Catholics taken from the CIA and the Hitler/Himmler
###4103 research and also into the technological advancements and put it into his Mormon church. George Romney was very
###4113 active and very high up in the Mormon church and they could foresee that as a strong opportunity for being able to lead
###4122 people by in a religious way. People are easily led by a religion because they do want to do what God tells them to do
###4136 but the religion that theyíre being taught is outside themselves when in fact spirituality and relationship with God
###4143 is within and yet religion can pull people down a path outside themselves where theyíre more easily led and controlled
###4152 particularly when systematic abuses are going on and MK ultra mind control, and technological advances are being
###4161 used as strong as they were in the Mormon church.
###4168 Thatís not to say all Mormons are bad. Thereís quite a few Mormons who are standing up once theyíre
###4177 able to think for themselves to make a positive difference and stop the abuse in their churches as well.
###4185 But thatís a little bit slower the devastation wreaked on people within the Mormon church is extensive
###4195 and is very much like the abuses that go on in the Jehovah's witnesses church that is just coming to light
###4205 where their mind control is so prevalent there as well and every time where the mind control is prevalent
###4212 there is always abuse and its usually sexual abuse of the children. We need to become aware of how people are being
###4220 led this way. When we have a politics that have no separation of church and state it allows for them to dictate or to
###4234 provide the information through the churches on a political agenda as well and is a very dangerous and very powerful
###4243 combination yet nevertheless itís all moving towards the same goal of a mind control of the masses in Mackinaw Island
###4254 Michigan I also heard George Romney talk about what is now known as global education where bringing the form
###4266 of mind control into the education system and altering the history and also pumping information into the childrenís head
###4275 at a rate to where they lose their ability discern and to creatively utilize the information but nevertheless itís just being
###4284 pumped into their head especially with the onset of computerization and harmonics coming through the headphones
###4291 while theyíre sitting at some of those computers. The computers were also deliberately designed to alter the history
###4302 that they were being taught because it was believed that to control the future all they needed to do is control the
###4309 history, again alter that knowledge base so that when they do formulate any thought or action itís based on something
###4318 thatís totally false or is something thatís lacking key elements such as mind control such as what really went on in
###4328 Nazi Germany. They knew how the mind responds to significant trauma. Combining the Hitler/Himmler research with what
###4341 the Catholics had learned, and taking it into a new level with through the CIA and through the technological advancements
###4354 that were beginning to come forth in society. We had television then which was having a strong impact on people
###4364 and gave them the ability to implement mass mind-control far stronger than Adolf Hitler could do and also through the
###4372 music because music was coming on so strong then and it was learned then how harmonics affect the brain function
###4382 as well. Itís like when you hear a specific song and you can remember something that had happened the first time you
###4392 ever heard that song. I heard people say that quite often well "i remember what happened um 'member when we
###4399 were in the car and this song came on and remember how we fell in love to that song" I mean people remember certain
###4405 events with music. Because the harmonic vibrations that affects the neuron pathways of the brain and allows for the
###4418 song lyrics to go in deeper. So harmonics were coming on real strong as well. In the early 60s project paperclip was
###4427 in full swing. The Nazi fascia scientists had been imported to the United States were put in key positions and
###4435 information was gleaned from them on what Adolf Hitler was using as mind control in Nazi Germany. This project paperclip
###4449 that brought the information in was being taken in by the CIA and criminal faction of the government that was very
###4458 much interested on how to control the mind of individuals as well as control the minds of a population more-so than
###4469 had occurred in Nazi Germany because those people had actually broke free of the Hitler plan to with the war but yet
###4482 the war was so traumatizing that it still left them unable to think for themselves to the point where they became
###4489 socially engineered. So thereís a great deal of information that was being brought into this country regarding the affects
###4497 of trauma on human mind. Itís well known that when trauma occurs people become highly suggestible. When traumas
###4509 occur in our societies such as what happened 9-1-1. This many people in this country PTSD'ed. They developed post
###4520 traumatic stress disorder, this PTSD left people unable to think clearly for themselves they were very fearful they were
###4530 very emotionally distraught over what had happened. And when theyíre not able to think clearly for themselves theyíre more
###4538 easily lead so when theyíre told what to do by the television while those horrible images are played over and over and over
###4545 again they become complaint they become apathetical and they become so easily led that America began to lose
###4560 some of its strength to the point where the criminals that have been control now for numerous generations took a
###4574 significant step forward in their control.
###4578 Someone said, this is the Kennedy assassination here, something very true. When you try to understand who was behind an
###4586 assassination look at who had the power to remove the security at the crucial time because he said assassinations donít just
###4595 happen they are allowed to happen. And when you look at the footage taken on a camera video camera by a member
###4602 of the public when Rabeen the Israeli prime minister was assassinated its extraordinary. You have the line of soldiers
###4609 lined up to protect Rabeen as he came to his car and in among them was the guy who killed him. As Rabeen appears
###4618 on this video extraordinary sight, the soldiers just walk backwards leaving the assassin on his own. Rabeen walks past
###4626 him thank you very much Good night. And itís the same with the Kennedy assassination and so many others.
###4633 This is the point where Kennedy was hit. This is Kennedyís car at the front.. thereís nobody on it. And yet you look at the car
###4640 behind which doesnít carry the president of the united states, thereís four security guards and two out-riders.
###4648 If theyíd of been there of course Kennedy could not have been killed by a bullet from outside cause he was so well
###4654 protected but the whole thing was removed the security to allow it to happen. During the last war in the
###4661 concentration camps of Germany in fact way way back this has been known about but particularly during the last
###4668 war, they started to perfect the manipulation of a natural mechanism in the mind that shuts out trauma. What
###4675 they did is that to understand that if you could systematically traumatize someone their mind would shut out
###4683 the memory of it and create an amnesic barrier which would be disconnected from the rest of the mind
###4689 this is what happens when people have a major road accident and they canít remember what happened
###4695 itís because the amnesic barrier has been created to shut out trauma so we donít keep reliving the horror
###4701 Good thing, but they realized if you could do that systematically and start with children particularly before
###4708 the age of 5 and 6 you could turn their mind into a honeycomb of self-contained compartments none of which was
###4715 aware of the others existence. And so through trigger words and what have you and trigger sentences hypnotic
###4720 keys one amnesic barrier becomes the conscious level that experiences something or is programmed to do something
###4728 and then is pushed back and another one is pulled forward. Itís actually got to the point where amazing as it may
###4735 seem you can be drunk in one compartment and completely sober in the other. Once the programming is in there
###4743 and in the biggest secret i put incredible documentation and background to this and what happened and trauma
###4753 based mind control and how it creates assassins and people going crazy with guns to justify taking guns out of
###4758 circulation all this stuff. When you look at the background all that is necessary is to program the guy push that
###4767 programming back into the mind and that will stay there at the subconscious level until some trigger comes in
###4774 when that trigger word or trigger action or whatever is said or done that programming is activated. So you can be
###4783 in normal mode and be very normal and no problem "never noticed anything different about old' henry that night"
###4790 trigger word BANG programming youíre like a robot.
###4795 The drug trade is run by the intelligence agencies of every country and that's to finance the weapons business
###4802 And also to recycle money okay recycle money
###4805 The whole thing has to make a 360 degree turn in a way that that money will always end up clean at the end
###4815 of this whole transformation you know of this. So the weapon dealers are happy the drug dealers are happy
###4825 the governments are happy because with the drugs they keep the people oppressed
###4831 How involved is the Vatican with this whole drug trade which is basically for the purpose of financing
###4839 the purchasing of weapons
###4842 Because the drug trade is supported by the CIA or any other agency involved it being the Mossad
###4851 or MI6 or whatever so they can go and finance those uh.. terrorist organizations that then create the
###4863 strategic tension that they require so they can implement their own police state and rule us by the stick.
###4871 Plus the drug itself makes the person who is using it depending on something which is supplies not
###4882 guaranteed so if for example in the future the government decides to truly close down those drug
###4892 cartels and stop immediately and once and for all the possibility of these drugs being spread through your
###4901 towns and through your cities then at that point you will see a lot of people coming out on the street
###4904 completely out of it because they are on a cold turkey situation and maybe theyíll start shooting and so
###4910 that really could be one of the ways used by the powerful elite to instigate a revolution just stop the drug
###4921 cartels and make all these people dependent of the white powder or any other drug get completely out of it.
###4930 We have a lot of manipulation with drugs for example the Mossad that is manipulating with the Psytrance
###4938 music all this big festivals of trance music this rave trance they call it and they have started this whole project
###4947 by taking control of the drug scene in Goa India which all this make up of all these people into this alternative
###4955 scene and so they can brainwash them with the fake religious ideals because after they take a few of these
###4962 acids they start obviously coming into contact with these demonic forces that can easily make themselves
###4973 present in their life and even they can sometimes bring them back from their dimension with them and never
###4981 get rid of them anymore
###4983 So how involved is the secret societies in the whole music industry
###4987 The involvement of secret society in music industry is very important. Since the time of the establishment
###4995 of certain lodges of Aleister Crowley in California to the subsequent spread of the beat and hippies generation
###5005 and musicians like the rolling stones, the Beatles, and many others who not only have been highly influenced
###5014 by this satanic creed but have sometimes openly embraced it like the rolling stones who have made even an album
###5022 called "Their Satanic Majesty's Request" and in fact Mick Jager has been awarded after many years for his
###5029 great work with the title of "Sir Mick Jager" by the queen herself, her satanic majesty ha-ha so you know you
###5039 get even an award if you have sympathy for the devil
###5044 But does uh.. does this even reach into the hip-hop music culture Yes
###5053 In the hip-hop music culture there is a lot of hip-hopers that are connected to black prince of freemasonry
###5061 I myself somebody who followed the hip-hop scene at the beginning when it was still genuine but letís say by
###5067 1986 it had already been infiltrated by the feds, the intelligence, CIA and it was used by for propaganda reasons and for
###5076 establishing also hatred towards the whites from the blacks with the Niggas With An Attitude and all the rest and after
###5085 they started to politicize this whole gang phenomenon so they could use it for establishing this whole culture which
###5093 has spread all over the world not only in the United States which is a culture of completely and utter dementia
###5103 I mean itís all about the booty how you shake your booty about how many gold chains you have how many cars you have
###5110 what kind of Jacuzzi you have. These are all values of Satan himself. This is satanic but we have certain freemasons
###5124 or prince of freemasonry that have been very important in the in this link between the gangs and the masonic
###5132 world Okay
###5136 So between the illegitimate and the legitimate Right wow thatís real interesting
###5143 And also for the use of symbolism that a lot of hip-hopers have done using the illuminati symbols
###5151 for their own for promoting their own  like what symbols are you talking about can you show me with your hands
###5158 It can be the one dollar bill or it can be the classic masonic symbol square and compass or many others.
###5166 An electron is a tiny tiny bit of matter, like a tiny marble
###5174 Letís fire a stream through one slit. It behaves just like the marble. A single band.
###5182 So if we shoot these tiny bits through two slits we should get like the marbles two bands.
###5192 What an interference pattern, we fired electrons tiny bits of matter through
###5200 But we get a pattern like waves not like little marbles. Physicist are clever they thought maybe those little
###5209 balls are bouncing off each other and creating that pattern. So they decide to shoot electrons one at a time
###5218 There is no way they can interfere with each other.
###5223 But after an hour of this the same interference pattern is seen to emerge
###5227 The conclusion is in-escapable: The single electron leaves as a particle becomes a wave of potentials goes
###5235 through both slits and interferes with itself to hit the wall like a particle, but mathematically its even stranger
###5245 it goes through both and it goes through neither, and it goes through just one and it goes through just the other
###5253 all of these possibilities are in super position with each other but physicists were completely baffled by this
###5259 so they decided to peek and see which slit it actually goes through.
###5266 They put a measuring device by one slit to see which one it went through and let it fly. he he
###5274 But the quantum world is far more mysterious than they could have imagined. When they observed the electron
###5282 went back to behaving like a little marble. It produced a pattern of two bands not an interference patter of many
###5292 the very act of measuring or observing which slit it went through meant it only went through one not both.
###5304 The electron decided to act differently
###5310 As though it was aware it was being watched.
###5314 And it was here that physicist stepped into the strange never world of quantum events.
###5322 What is matter marbles? or waves? And waves of what...
###5329 and what does and observer have to do with any of this.
###5334 The observer collapsed the wave function simply by observing.
###5349 Tonightís talk is consciousness, creativity and the brain and if you have a golf-ball size consciousness when you read
###5358 a book you'll have a golf-ball size understanding, when you look out a golf-ball size awareness and when you
###5367 wake up in the morning a golf-ball size wakefulness. But if you could expand that consciousness then you read the
###5376 book, more understanding, you look out more awareness and when you wake up more wakefulness its consciousness
###5386 and thereís an ocean of pure vibrant consciousness inside each one of us and its right at the source and base of mind
###5398 right at the source of thought and itís all at the source of all matter
###5403 There is no matter as such all matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particle of an
###5415 atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together, we must assume behind this force
###5427 the existence of a conscious and intelligent mind. This mind is the matrix of all matter.
###5436 Matter seems like a good place to begin. The solidity of the world seems totally indisputable. As a fixed thing that
###5443 you can see and touch your body also reassuringly solid but beginning with Einstein modern physics has assured us that
###5452 this solidity is a mirage.
###5456 All of physical matter, everything we have around us, is a result of a frequency and what that also means is that if you
###5464 amplify the frequency the structure of the matter will change
###5469 What this self-contained system is a hologram is what i call the super hologram every within it is an expression of that
###5481 hologram and this is one of the great characteristics of a hologram is that every part of a holographic picture is a
###5492 smaller version of the whole  itís as if reality is so connected  that when you look at
###5496 one small part you can see things about other parts that the entire whole is contained in the part and in a sense
###5502 you canít divide reality up because were cutting up a hologram. We canít find where one particle is because itís always
###5509 a reflection of all particles.  In a hologram the whole pattern is whole and complete onto itself
###5517 and if you were to take any little portion of this whole out and examine it closely you will see the entire pattern
###5524 repeating itself again and again and again. Anywhere in this pattern if we were to change one little aspect on any
###5533 one of these little holograms change would be reflected throughout the entire system.
###5539 Quantum physics has revealed what ancient masters knew - matter does not exist. The concept of substance
###5549 arose from the philosophy of Aristotle and from that concept came sciences conception of matter,
###5559 the fact of the matter is that the substance of the universe is consciousness belief that the substance of the universe
###5569 is matter leads to what i call a fear-grade dichotomy as people in their quite desperate attempt to accumulate
###5580 as many material possessions and riches as possible. In fact the substance of the universe is consciousness
###5590 therefore it is behavior that is important If you get into the realms of fear
###5596 Fear is a very slow dense vibrational state, and the more you embody fear and the whole of this manipulated
###5608 society is globally is structured to make us fear to make us have stress to make us worry about tomorrow
###5615 and have guilt about yesterday, and forget about now. It brings us into a slow vibrating dense state.
###5625 We should be very careful about what we believe about the future. The more you attach to a belief system the more
###5631 if reality is holographic, youíre helping create it by believing it and you know the great clairvoyant Edgard Casey said
###5638 that our every thought that reality is built out of thought and our every thought starts to build reality and were like every
###5646 thought is like a spider were like spiders spinning web and that web starts to build and build
###5650 information is the key because this matrix this illusory reality that we think is real people say to me
###5662 what is the matrix its information information create fractals as information flow
###5668 increases the number of fractals mathematically speaking increase. This was demonstrated by a mathematician
###5674 by the name Theodor Gordon, fractals are unpredictable functions so things are becoming more and more
###5679 unpredictable  when you start getting into fractals and chaos theory when you look at
###5685 it in terms of a society this is where it starts to cross over into the so called illuminati and the negative
###5691 elite the world leaders with their philosophy of order out of chaos.. there is some truth to that in the sense that
###5697 when the system becomes highly destabilized there will be random shifts that suddenly self-organize into
###5706 higher complexity at the subatomic level reality behaves in accordance with the expectation of the observer or
###5717 the measurer the scientist why is that remarkable? Because everything in the universe is composed of those
###5722 subatomic particles these atoms are particles that are whirling at lightning speeds around huge empty space
###5731 and the particles arenít material objects, they're fluctuations of energy and information in a huge void of energy
###5739 and information and what the science now is showing is that when you can change the field in which the atom is
###5745 in you change the atom, and were made of those atoms. So when we have feelings in our heart were changing the
###5751 field that connects the stuff that everything is made of and were literally altering our physical reality
###5757 Once you establish the reality we live in and the nature of what the physical body is, itís a biological computer,
###5765 and the nature of what we are which is consciousness and then you start as I have looking at the way this world
###5773 is structured and how it works and why they do this and why they do that, it suddenly brings into crystal clarity
###5781 why the world is structured as it is because
###5785 you know people look through their eyes and they think this the world but it isnít itís a tiny tiny frequency
###5794 range within an infinite energy field of infinite frequency range and basically itís like holographic television channel
###5803 It is the act of consciousness that actually creates the building blocks the universe is made of. I can't even imagine a
###5812 universe that exists without us because itís the act of us observing the world around us that is creating allowing us to
###5820 create as we go in a participatory universe. We may never find the edge of our universe as we're looking to define
###5829 what this universe looks like, we may never find the smallest particle in the quantum world to see what the
###5836 stuff is were made out of and the reason is because everywhere we look everywhere that consciousness explores
###5845 with the expectation that something will be there that exploration that act of looking observation is the act
###5854 that creates something for us to see. That we are actually building this universe as we go
###5860 Consciousness is the programming language of the universe. We are consciousness conductors thatís what we do thatís
###5868 who we are consciousness comes through us emanates from us. We are the creators, we are the ones who are
###5875 targeted on this planet because we are the ones who transmit the reality just like everybody else does. If you switch
###5882 your brain off and you sucked in to the mainstream media illusion we must understand that we are being used
###5890 because we create reality so if we are manipulated in a certain way and if we are modulated in a certain way
###5898 then our creation becomes not ours but somebody elseís And what happens if we all did
###5903 everyone in this room decides to take control of reality Iím talking about reality Iím talking about quantum physics
###5910 Iím talking about taking control of things from the quantum level up from the molecular level up and it works. One of the things
###5916 were actually dealing with is some kind of operating system that can be hacked using words
###5923 The world is like a ride in an amusement park and when you chose to go on it you think its real cause thatís how powerful
###5928 our minds are and the ride goes up and down and round and round it has thrills and chills and its very brightly colored
###5933 and its very loud and its fun for a while. Some people have been on the ride for a long time and they begin to question
###5940 is this real or is this just a ride and other people have remembered and they come back to us and they say "hey don't worry
###5946 don't be afraid ever because.... this is just a ride."
###6073 Look buddy I don't want no hassle today either pay for it or put it back
###6081 Sleep, sleep, sleep...
###6115 Can you believe it she didn't even go to Lamaze Class I told her for yourself and for the baby, Go!
###6140 [gossiping]
###6155 I'm so depressed I donít know what to do Hey go for it man
###6159 Easy for you to say you got the promotion Look it will come alright just don't worry about it
###6166 [TV] The feeling is definitely there, itís a new morning in America, fresh vital the old
###6173 cynicism is gone. We have faith in our leaders were optimistic as to what the comes to it all
###6180 It really boils down to our ability to accept. We donít need pessimism, there are no limits
###6189 It figures it would be something like this.
###6212 Well let me explain the (new) world order, let me help you ...
###6351 9-11
###6353 with a female underage in a motel by the Dallas police department on September eleventh 1960
###6445 We have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future generations
###6450 a New World Order a world where the rule of law not the law of the jungle governs the conduct of
###6458 nations. When we are successful and we will be, we have a real chance at this New World Order
###6466 I think a New World Order is emerging then really a New World Order can be created
###6471 itís a great opportunity a phrase that i often use myself that we need a New World Order
###6480 Those people who have been yelling oh the UN is going to take over global government
###6485 Conspiracy theorists  Theyíve been crazy but now theyíre right
###6488 Itís happening When Geithner said he would be open to the idea
###6493 of a global currency last week those conspiracy people had said and suggested that for years
###6499 youíre not wrong.
###6713 We can all make a change. We don't need a US president to make a change. We don't need the
###6721 Dalai Lama to make a change. We don't need the pope to make a change. What we need to make a
###6726 change is our own heart. Our own hearts needs to be placed in the right place and it has to have
###6733 the right feelings. I'm Sorry
###6736 But I donít want to be and emperor thatís not my business. I donít want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help
###6743 everyone if possible Jew, gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another human beings are like that
###6752 we want to live by each otherís happiness not by each otherís misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another.
###6758 And this world has room for everyone and the good Earth is rich and can provide for everyone.
###6763 The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls, has
###6771 barricaded the world with hate, has goose stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed
###6778 but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made
###6784 us cynical, our cleverness hard and unkind, we think too much and feel too little. More than machinery
###6791 we need humanity, more than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities life would
###6797 be violent and all would be lost. The airplane and the radio has brought us closer together, the very nature of these
###6804 inventions cries out for the goodness in men. Cries out for universal brotherhood, for the unity of us all
###6810 Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women and children
###6816 Victim of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. For those who can hear me I say
###6823 do not despair, the misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way
###6830 of human progress. The hate of men who will pass, and dictators die and the power they took from the people
###6837 will return to the people and so long as men die liberty will never perish. Soldiers don't give yourselves to
###6846 brutes, men who despise you, enslave you, who regiment your lives, tell you what to do what to think and what
###6852 to feel. Who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder, donít give yourself to these
###6859 unnatural men. Machine men with machine minds and machine hearts. You are not machines. You are not
###6865 cattle.. you are men. You have the love of humanity in your hearts. You don't hate, only the unloved hate, the
###6872 unloved and the unnatural. Soldiers don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty in the 17th chapter of Saint Luke it is
###6879 written the kingdom of god is within man not one man nor a group of men but in all men, in you, YOU the people
###6886 have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness, you the people have the power
###6892 to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy
###6898 let us use that power, let us all unite. Let us all fight for a new world, a decent world that will give man a chance
###6906 to work, that will give youth a future and old agers security. By the promise of these things brutes have risen to power
###6913 but they lie, they do not fulfill that promise, they never will. Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people
###6921 Now let us fight to fulfill that promise, let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers. To do
###6929 away with greed, with hate and intolerance, let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress
###6936 will lead to all menís happiness. Soldiers in the name of democracy
###6942 Let us all UNITE
###6957 I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know that you're afraid.
###6963 You're afraid of us. You're afraid of change. I don't know the future.
###6970 I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how itís going to begin.
###6976 I'm going to hang up this phone, and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see.
###6981 I'm going to show them a world without you,
###6986 A world without rules and controls without borders or boundaries
###6990 A world where anything is possible
###6996 Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.
