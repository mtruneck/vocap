###1 UNIDENTIFIED MALES AND FEMALES: (inaudible) CNN STUDENT NEWS And Carl Azuz
###15 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###18 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Hi. Welcome to a new week of CNN STUDENT NEWS. I`m Carl Azuz. First
###28 up today, a little history in the making: four of these famous first were heading over
###32 to South Korea. As of today, that country has a brand new leader. Park Geun-hye is 61
###38 years old. She won the presidential election last December and by now you`ve probably guessed
###42 why her win is historic. Park is South Korea`s first female president. But it`s not the first
###48 time she`s been connected to the South Korean presidency. In fact, her experience around
###52 this job started when she was younger than all of you.
###56 While the world may not know much about South Korea`s first female president, the life of
###61 Park Geun-hye and her family fill her nation`s history books. Born into politics, her father
###67 Park Chung-hee was described by some as the country`s first dictator. He seized power
###72 when the military took control of the government in 1961. Park was just nine years old then.
###77 Her father would rule South Korea with an iron fist for the next 18 years overseeing
###82 huge economic growth as well as human rights abuses. Personal tragedy hit Park Geun-hye
###88 while she was studying overseas in 1974. Back in Seoul, her mother was shot dead by someone
###94 loyal to North Korea. The bullet was intended for Park`s father. The failed assassination
###100 attempt drastically changed the course of Park Geun-hye`s life. Her dreams of being
###105 a professor were set aside. She had act as South Korea`s first lady putting the nation`s
###110 interests above her own. Five years later, there was another assassination attempt on
###114 her father. This time it was successful. His intelligence chief shot him at a dinner party
###120 saying he wanted South Korea to become a free democracy. It was two decades later that Park
###125 Geun- hye decided to return to the public`s spotlight and launch her own political career.
###130 And then last December, as head of the Conservative Party, this 61 years old who never married
###135 and doesn`t have children was elected president with an overwhelming majority. One of her
###140 major challenges as president will be dealing with North Korea. She met the late Kim Jong-il
###146 in 2002 in an attempt to end the bad blood between the two families. Park Geun-hye says
###151 she wants to resume talks with North Korea and restart the aid program on the condition
###156 that North Korea abandons its nuclear weapons program. But after its third nuclear test,
###161 analysts believe North Korean leader Kim Jong Un clearly isn`t interested.
###168 Heading to Japan for our next story. Engineers there getting rid of an old hotel in Tokyo.

###173 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###175 AZUZ: But not like that. They`re trying a different demolition approach. Say hello to
###179 the incredible shrinking building. This hotel is 40 stories tall, and engineers were taking
###184 it away one story at a time. May not look like much on the outside, but check out what`s
###189 happening on the inside. The crews go floor by floor using temporary jacks - those hold
###195 up the higher floor while the workers take out beams, support columns and debris. Then
###199 the jacks lower what`s left and the crew moves on. Why do it this way? That`s a lot quieter
###205 than a standard demolition which keeps the neighbors happy, and new chance of an implosion
###210 damaging other buildings. It`s also more expensive and it takes longer - in this case, and estimated
###215 six or seven months.
###217 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###219 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See if you can I.D. me: you`ll find me in space about 93 million miles
###226 from Earth. Also, I`m made up of different gases. Astronomers consider me a yellow dwarf
###232 star and I`m the closest star to your planet. I`m the Sun. And the temperature at my core
###242 is believed to be 27 million degrees Fahrenheit.
###246 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###248 AZUZ: So, the sun is hot. And what you`re seeing according to NASA is an eruption on
###253 the Sun surface. It`s set up a bunch of fiery plasma, and that appeared to rain back down
###258 in a circular ark. Look, how in comparison, the Earth is so much smaller than this eruption
###263 alone. The sun is thought to be about 109 times the width of the Earth. A couple of
###269 other things here: this was recorded last summer, and it`s sped up. Every second you
###274 see is about six minutes of real time. Scientists say the Sun`s magnetic field caused the plasma
###279 to cascade in a circle. And fans of Adele might appreciate how the Sun set fire to the
###284 rain.
###284 Yesterday, was the Daytona 500. We`re not worried about who took the checkered flag
###288 on Sunday. We`re talking about what happened there on Saturday.
###291 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###292 TONY STEWART, NASCAR DRIVER: I`ve never seen anything like that. I mean we`ve seen Petty,
###295 you know, we`ve seen a lot of big ones here. And I`ve been a part of a couple of big ones
###299 here, but I`ve never seen anything like that.
###301 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###301 AZUZ: He`s talking about a wreck in the final lap of a warm-up race. Sports come with risk,
###305 that`s something Nascar drivers all deal with, but not usually the fans. Some of the debris
###310 from this crash flew into, over and threw a protective fans. At least 28 people in the
###316 stands were injured, some were taken to hospitals, others were checked out by a medical staff
###321 at the track.
###322 It`s been about four months since the so-called Superstorm Sandy hit the northeastern U.S.
###327 People are still feeling the effects of the storm, working to rebuild homes and businesses.
###330 But it`s not just people who were affected. Natural disasters can take a toll on the natural
###335 habitat of animals as well. When that happens, the creatures may be forced into new areas.
###340 In the New York City, that`s causing some problems.
###343 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###344 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Night descends on New York City, and things can get pretty creepy.
###349 And after Superstorm Sandy, even creepier. Terry Riggio says the rat problem in her hard-hit
###355 Lower Manhattan neighborhood exploded.
###357 THERESA RIGGIO, NEW YORK RESIDENT: It`s crazy. You come home from work, you see a rat. It
###361 could be daylight, you see a rat. Your walk your dogs past nighttime, you see rats frolicking
###367 like they are playing like they are pets having fun. It`s disgusting.
###371 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When Sandy flooded subways and tunnels, the theory is rats were literally
###376 flushed out, forced to relocate and they`re staying put. Traps to try and catch them dart
###382 streets in Lower Manhattan where construction has only compounded the problem.
###387 Timothy Wong says, his pest-control company is constantly trying to stock up on supplies.
###392 TIMOTHY WONG, M&M PEST CONTROL: We even have, believe it or not, for these really nice fancy
###396 areas in Manhattan where they can`t use really ugly base station, they have live rock base
###402 stations where, you know, it looks like a rock and you can`t tell, but inside there`s
###406 actually a whole where the rats can go in, where you can actually put poison in there.
###409 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Wang says his company, M&M pest control has gotten more than twice
###414 as many complaints about rats and mice compared to a year ago at this time. It`s not what
###419 the Health Department says it`s seeing. Saying that while large storms can flush out rats,
###424 they can also drown them.
###426 JEFF WOODS, M&M PEST CONTROL: Some poison up in the ceiling ...
###428 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Growing numbers are not. M&M exterminator Jeff Woods says he sees New
###433 York in a whole different light.
###435 WOODS: So it is three years of doing it, we kind of get a - you`re always looking over
###440 your shoulder.
###440 WANG: It`s been keeping us busy. People`s nightmare is really, you know, a good day
###444 for us.

###446 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes out Ms. Flatebo`s class at Lincoln Intermediate
###450 School n Mason City, Iowa. Which of these is a measurement of the imperfections in a
###456 diamond? Here we go, is it cut, color, carat or clarity? You`ve got three seconds, go!
###470 A diamond`s clarity refers to how many imperfections the stone does or does not have. That`s your
###477 answer and that`s your "Shoutout".

###482 AZUZ: Diamonds and people have imperfections, but what Billy Ray Harris did when he found
###486 a diamond ring was flawless.
###488 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###488 BILLY RAY HARRIS: What I actually feel like is what has the world come to when a person
###492 to return something that don`t belong to him.
###494 AZUZ: Billy is homeless. He lives in Kansas City, so does Sarah Darling. One day Sarah
###498 gave Billy some change, and accidentally gave him her ring, too. When Sarah came back, Billy
###503 was ready to hand the ring back over.
###506 SARAH DARLING: So, I just am so grateful.
###508 RAY HARRIS: I could tell exactly how much it meant to you the moment I held it up like
###512 that.
###512 (LAUGHTER)
###512 DARLING: Yes.
###513 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###513 AZUZ: Billy says, he acted the way his grandfather who raised him would have expected, and wasn`t
###518 looking for a reward. Sarah and her husband started the fundraiser to thank Billy, though.
###522 Their goal was to raise $1000. As of yesterday, donations were up to $139,000 and counting.
###531 Some friends of mine were debating this, if they found $5 in the ground and no one was
###535 around, they`ll probably keep it. But for something as valuable as a ring, they`d try
###539 to find its owner or at least a lost and found. What is the cut off? Join in today`s blog

###545 We`re going to wrap things up today with a little friendly teasing. The frog is a little
###553 odd, but that`s not what this Youtube clips are about, it`s about how the dogs react.
###558 Some flip out, some are confused. What they do seem to know is that it sounds exactly
###562 like one of their squeaky toys. Unfortunately for them, there is no chance the dog sinking
###567 their teeth into this thing, which means there is no danger of the frog croaking. We`re going
###572 to end with that ribbitting story. Teachers, don`t forget to visit out page and give us
###575 your feedback on today`s show. We`ll hop back tomorrow with more CNN STUDENT NEWS.
