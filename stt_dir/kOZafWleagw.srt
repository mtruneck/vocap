KEVIN JONES: So here we
are in this crazy


4
0:0:31,39 --> 0:0:33,47
place, Red Rocks, Colorado.


5
0:0:33,47 --> 0:0:36,17
And we're at the "TB20"
premiere.

0:0:36,17 --> 0:0:37,65
MIKE HATCHETT: TB is
Totally Board, and


7
0:0:37,65 --> 0:0:40,13
20 is our 20th film.


8
0:0:40,13 --> 0:0:43,41
Feel like we accomplished
something there, and feel like


9
0:0:43,41 --> 0:0:46,34
that was a major, I
guess, milestone.


10
0:0:46,34 --> 0:0:48,12
Whatever-- sounds kind of cheesy
or whatever, but to get


11
0:0:48,12 --> 0:0:52,56
to 20 years, I'm happy to be
able to actually work in the


12
0:0:52,56 --> 0:0:55,26
snowboard industry
for 20 years.


13
0:0:55,26 --> 0:0:56,24
TRAVIS ROBB: When you
hit a 20-year


14
0:0:56,24 --> 0:0:57,776
thing, it's a big deal.


15
0:0:57,776 --> 0:1:1,18
It's more about everybody at
this point that's ever been


16
0:1:1,18 --> 0:1:4,3
involved, ever put
effort into it.


17
0:1:4,3 --> 0:1:5,69
That's really what the
movie's about.


18

DAVE HATCHETT: I honestly never
envisioned that Standard


19
0:1:8,93 --> 0:1:9,47
Films would last this long.


20
0:1:9,47 --> 0:1:11,44
And we have definitely outlasted
every other film


21
0:1:11,44 --> 0:1:12,6
company out there.


22
0:1:12,6 --> 0:1:14,45

all started, and

0:1:14,45 --> 0:1:15,6
we're still there now.


24
0:1:15,6 --> 0:1:17,76
JIM RIPPEY: Standard films is
notorious for getting up


25
0:1:17,76 --> 0:1:20,78
early, and getting onto those
obstacles, and getting out


26
0:1:20,78 --> 0:1:22,28
there and getting the shots.


27
0:1:22,28 --> 0:1:24,15
And it takes a lot
of hard work.


28
0:1:24,15 --> 0:1:26,7
And that's a big part
of their success.

KEVIN JONES: There wasn't
6,000 film crews


30
0:1:29,276 --> 0:1:30,16
like there is today.


31
0:1:30,16 --> 0:1:33,486

of living back then, you had

37
0:1:57,74 --> 0:1:58,5

Kind of like a rhythm section,
like a moto section.

imagined myself as a fashion

shooting snowboarding.

And then Dave invited me out
to go rock climbing.


88
0:4:53,98 --> 0:4:56,2
And he takes me climbing for
the day, and I'm kind of


89
0:4:56,2 --> 0:4:57,9

occurred to me.

It's really, really
fun, and it's so


102
0:5:18,55 --> 0:5:19,69
much funner than skiing.


103
0:5:19,69 --> 0:5:21,9

it because it's like surfing.

DAVE HATCHETT: Mike and I
started this film company


109
0:5:29,41 --> 0:5:31,69
called Fusion Films, which was
kind of a precursor to


110
0:5:31,69 --> 0:5:32,99
Standard Films.


111
0:5:32,99 --> 0:5:34,23
And we really just--


112
0:5:34,23 --> 0:5:35,25
we went in the backcountry,
because we


113
0:5:35,25 --> 0:5:36,52
needed to get footage.


114
0:5:36,52 --> 0:5:39,43
And the ski resorts will just
get chopped up so quick, and


115
0:5:39,43 --> 0:5:41,7
it just wasn't aesthetically
that rad to film.


116
0:5:41,7 --> 0:5:44,39
So we were just looking across
the street from Donner Ski


117
0:5:44,39 --> 0:5:47,19
Ranch, and we just knew it was
all virgin, untracked powder,


118
0:5:47,19 --> 0:5:49,26
and it was a lot easier to work
back there and get shots.

120
0:5:56,1 --> 0:5:58,41
DAVE HATCHETT: It was is just
the very first times that


121
0:5:58,41 --> 0:6:1,49
anyone filmed snowboarding in
the backcountry or anywhere.


122
0:6:1,49 --> 0:6:3,69
So we kind of got this idea,
I'll be the rider.


123
0:6:3,69 --> 0:6:5,23
Mike will be the
cinematographer.


124
0:6:5,23 --> 0:6:8,21
We'll get some friends of ours,
and we'll all just be


125
0:6:8,21 --> 0:6:9,535
together, and we'll
make this movie.

127
0:6:18,37 --> 0:6:19,92
DAVE HATCHETT: The movie
came out pretty good.


128
0:6:19,92 --> 0:6:23,3
It was a pretty fun
to watch movie.


129
0:6:23,3 --> 0:6:25,27
At the time, it was
cutting edge.


130
0:6:25,27 --> 0:6:28,3
And financially,
it just bombed.


131
0:6:28,3 --> 0:6:29,6
We just didn't sell
enough videos.


132
0:6:29,6 --> 0:6:31,53
And then we tried to get
sponsorship again the next


133
0:6:31,53 --> 0:6:32,57

134

"Totally Board," I worked


135
0:6:34,13 --> 0:6:36,23
for Fall Line Films
for two years.


136
0:6:36,23 --> 0:6:37,62
And Dave and I--


137
0:6:37,62 --> 0:6:39,64
Dave was filming
with Mack Dawg.


138
0:6:39,64 --> 0:6:42,69
And Dave's like, dude, you and
Mack Dawg should start your


139
0:6:42,69 --> 0:6:43,35
own company.


140
0:6:43,35 --> 0:6:45,22
Jerry and Artie aren't
treating you very


141
0:6:45,22 --> 0:6:46,55
good at Fall Line.


142
0:6:46,55 --> 0:6:48,64
And it was his, actually,
idea.


143
0:6:48,64 --> 0:6:51,12
You guys should put the big
mountain stuff in with the


144
0:6:51,12 --> 0:6:52,98
freestyle, and we should
make a movie.


145
0:6:52,98 --> 0:6:56,38
JIM RIPPEY: So they basically
said, hey, let's meet the


146
0:6:56,38 --> 0:6:59,4
minds, and let's create
something together that brings


147
0:6:59,4 --> 0:7:0,93
both aspects of snowboarding.


148
0:7:0,93 --> 0:7:3,22
You go to Alaska and get your
big mountain riding.


149
0:7:3,22 --> 0:7:6,0
We'll mix the best of that big
mountain riding with all the


150
0:7:6,0 --> 0:7:9,46
jibbing and freestyle
park type stuff.


151
0:7:9,46 --> 0:7:10,6
DAVE HATCHETT: We were just
pretty much just sitting in


152
0:7:10,6 --> 0:7:13,23
the house one day, and I said
hey, let's send out a proposal


153
0:7:13,23 --> 0:7:16,82
and see if we can kind of try
and do what we did with Fusion


154
0:7:16,82 --> 0:7:18,63
Films, but let's just do it
in a new environment.


155
0:7:18,63 --> 0:7:20,37
Maybe we can get sponsorship
this time.


156
0:7:20,37 --> 0:7:23,98
And within a week, we raised
about $80,000 through Wave


157
0:7:23,98 --> 0:7:26,21
Rave and Burton and several
other sponsors.


158
0:7:26,21 --> 0:7:28,72
And that was kind of when
Standard Films was born.


159
0:7:28,72 --> 0:7:31,4
That year, we made Standard
Films' first movie, "TB2--A


160

0:7:33,84 --> 0:7:36,525

TOM BURT: It turned out that
most of the areas that people


165
0:8:1,61 --> 0:8:4,35
ride were developed by us.


166
0:8:4,35 --> 0:8:8,9
Almost everything was
new, besides for--


167
0:8:8,9 --> 0:8:9,71
there's a handful of backcountry
skiers who had


168
0:8:9,71 --> 0:8:13,21
been skiing things, but not
necessarily like what we were


169
0:8:13,21 --> 0:8:17,4
looking for as far as steeper,
more technical lines.


170
0:8:17,4 --> 0:8:19,9
DAVE HATCHETT: Me and Tom Burt
were some of the first guys to


171
0:8:19,9 --> 0:8:23,53
ever jump the I-80 drop, which
is a big famous drop that all


172
0:8:23,53 --> 0:8:25,3
the film crews race to now.


173
0:8:25,3 --> 0:8:28,92
It's a big 50-foot, pretty
good sized drop.


174
0:8:28,92 --> 0:8:32,15
And all throughout the Tahoe
backcountry, we definitely did


175
0:8:32,15 --> 0:8:34,88
several first descents, and we
were certainly the first film


176
0:8:34,88 --> 0:8:37,5
crews to go out there and work
certain areas and certain


177
0:8:37,5 --> 0:8:40,14
circs and ride certain lines,
without a doubt.


178
0:8:40,14 --> 0:8:41,95
JIM RIPPEY: The Hatchetts were
basically filming the kind of


179
0:8:41,95 --> 0:8:45,51
stuff that I wanted to ride
anyway, so it fit perfectly.


180
0:8:45,51 --> 0:8:49,44
I like to ride freestyle and
ride in the parks, but I also


181
0:8:49,44 --> 0:8:52,19
wanted to go to places like
Alaska and get on the steep


182
0:8:52,19 --> 0:8:55,52
stuff that really got
my adrenaline going.


183
0:8:55,52 --> 0:8:59,975
JEREMY JONES: They were really,
at that time, defining


184
0:8:59,975 --> 0:9:4,57
how to shoot skiing or
snowboarding in Alaska.


185
0:9:4,57 --> 0:9:8,39
And a lot of the stuff that
they developed over those


186
0:9:8,39 --> 0:9:13,6
years is just kind of second
nature in that whole big


187
0:9:13,6 --> 0:9:14,42
mountain scene.


188
0:9:14,42 --> 0:9:17,3
DAVE DOWNING: I mean, I saw
"TB2" when it came out, and it


189
0:9:17,3 --> 0:9:19,56
blew me away.


190
0:9:19,56 --> 0:9:21,57
The whole thing blew me away--
the Alaska footage.


191
0:9:21,57 --> 0:9:24,75

five minutes long and it's all


192

those guys did something


196
0:9:36,75 --> 0:9:41,81

inspired them to pursue board

Standard Films will always be


202
0:9:53,3 --> 0:9:55,27
known for, is just a really
high-quality product.

JEREMY JONES: Part of me is
pissed off at those guys


204
0:9:57,6 --> 0:10:1,4
because they did hold such a
high standard that it was like


205
0:10:1,4 --> 0:10:4,99
you could do something amazing,
but you let go of


206
0:10:4,99 --> 0:10:7,68
your grab too early, and it's
on the floor, because it


207
0:10:7,68 --> 0:10:8,65
wasn't just perfect.
