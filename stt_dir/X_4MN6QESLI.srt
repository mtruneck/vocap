CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Like me, some of you
may love hitting the gym, for others it might


2
0:0:4,68 --> 0:0:9,86
seem like a chore. But what happens when police
use pushups as a punishment? We`re going to


3
0:0:9,86 --> 0:0:26,46
work out the details today on CNN STUDENT
NEWS.


4
0:0:26,46 --> 0:0:30,73
President Obama, members of Congress, corporate
executives, small business owners -- all of


5
0:0:30,73 --> 0:0:34,75
them involved in meetings this week, they
are all talking about the same thing -- the


6
0:0:34,75 --> 0:0:39,85
fiscal cliff. Yesterday, we said what could
happen if the government goes over that cliff,


7
0:0:39,85 --> 0:0:45,16
so to speak, on January 1st. Taxes would go
up for all Americans, government spending


8
0:0:45,16 --> 0:0:50,51
would be automatically cut for different government
services. What we didn`t mention, is that


9
0:0:50,51 --> 0:0:55,26
the government set this thing up when they
couldn`t work out a deal to lower the U.S.


10
0:0:55,26 --> 0:1:0,78
debt, lawmakers and the president came up
with this idea for this automatic spending


11
0:1:0,78 --> 0:1:5,84
cuts. Everyone involved agrees that the debt
needs to be reduced. They don`t agree on how


12
0:1:5,84 --> 0:1:8,71
to do that. So for now, the clock is ticking.


13
0:1:8,71 --> 0:1:14,859
The person you`re looking at here is Maria
Santos Gorrostieta. From 2008 to 2011 she


14
0:1:14,859 --> 0:1:19,329
was the mayor of a town in Mexico that was
plagued by violence from the country`s drug


15
0:1:19,329 --> 0:1:25,71
war. The mayor herself was targeted by attacks
twice. She survived both times. This month,


16
0:1:25,71 --> 0:1:31,99
Gorrostieta was kidnapped. Her body was found
last week. The drug war and the wave of violence


17
0:1:31,99 --> 0:1:37,17
that`s part of it have dominated Mexican politics
for years. It`s something that the outgoing


18
0:1:37,17 --> 0:1:41,649
president, Felipe Calderon has faced, and
it`s something that Mexico`s next president,


19
0:1:41,649 --> 0:1:45,81
Enrique Pena Nieto will face as well. Brian
Todd examines their approaches.


20
0:1:45,81 --> 0:1:46,31
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


21
0:1:46,31 --> 0:1:50,659
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Deploying the
Mexican army and Marines as never before,


22
0:1:50,659 --> 0:1:55,959
Calderon fought the cartels head on, took
out several kingpins. But during his six-year


23
0:1:55,959 --> 0:2:2,7
term, the streets of Juarez, Tijuana, Sinaloa
flowed with blood. At least 50,000 Mexicans


24
0:2:2,7 --> 0:2:7,56
were killed. Many of them innocent civilians.
That`s far more than the American death tolls


25
0:2:7,56 --> 0:2:13,53
in Iraq and Afghanistan combined. Homicide
rates in those areas have recently plateaued.


26
0:2:13,53 --> 0:2:17,739
And a Mexican official tells us, civilians
there are telling them they do feel safer


27
0:2:17,739 --> 0:2:23,34
now. Tourism is bouncing back. Analysts say
President-elect Pena Nieto will continue to


28
0:2:23,34 --> 0:2:26,129
confront the cartels, but in a more nuanced
way.


29
0:2:26,129 --> 0:2:29,72
ERIC OLSON, WOODROW WILSON CENTER: With the
United States, he is going to ask for more


30
0:2:29,72 --> 0:2:34,28
intelligence sharing from the United States.
There`s been intelligence sharing, it`s been


31
0:2:34,28 --> 0:2:41,159
in a little more limited way. They would like
to see that expanded. So that Mexican authorities,


32
0:2:41,159 --> 0:2:47,379
police, army, Marines have more information
and can go after the bad guys with that intelligence.


33
0:2:47,379 --> 0:2:48,4
(END VIDEOTAPE)


34
0:2:48,4 --> 0:2:53,51
AZUZ: Today`s first "Shoutout" goes out to
Mr. Oswald`s class at Craver Middle School


35
0:2:53,51 --> 0:2:55,98
in Colorado City, Colorado.


36
0:2:55,98 --> 0:3:1,51
Who was the first American to travel into
space? You know what to do. Was it Neil Armstrong,


37
0:3:1,51 --> 0:3:10,739
John Glenn, Alan Shepard or Buzz Aldrin? You`ve
got three seconds, go.


38
0:3:10,739 --> 0:3:19,549
On May 5, 1961, Alan Shepard entered the history
books as the first American in space. That`s


39
0:3:19,549 --> 0:3:22,59
your answer and that`s your "Shoutout."


40
0:3:22,59 --> 0:3:27,98
Shepard`s historic flight lasted around 15
minutes. Captain Scott Kelly is going to be


41
0:3:27,98 --> 0:3:35,37
in space a little longer than that. 365 days
longer. Started in the spring of 2015, U.S.


42
0:3:35,37 --> 0:3:41,269
astronaut is set to spend an entire year in
space. Kelly and a Russian cosmonaut will


43
0:3:41,269 --> 0:3:45,42
be up in the international space station,
orbiting the earth, while the planet does


44
0:3:45,42 --> 0:3:50,39
one full orbit around the sun. Officials at
NASA are hoping that this mission will help


45
0:3:50,39 --> 0:3:55,439
them learn more about how extended time in
space effects the human body. And that might


46
0:3:55,439 --> 0:4:0,719
help plan for future missions to an asteroid
or even another planet. Kelly has spent a


47
0:4:0,719 --> 0:4:6,87
total of 180 days in space, but that`s been
spaced out over four previous trips. Going


48
0:4:6,87 --> 0:4:10,939
for a year straight, that would set a new
U.S. record.


49
0:4:10,939 --> 0:4:14,879
Scientists create new technologies and give
them artificial intelligence. The machines


50
0:4:14,879 --> 0:4:19,389
take on a life of their own, rise up against
their creators and destroy the human race.


51
0:4:19,389 --> 0:4:23,55
It sounds like a plot of a sci- fi movie,
and it has been. But some researchers wonder,


52
0:4:23,55 --> 0:4:29,19
if it could happen in real life. Scientists
at a university in Great Britain say it`s


53
0:4:29,19 --> 0:4:33,889
reasonable to predict that machines could
have independent intelligence, sometime in


54
0:4:33,889 --> 0:4:39,319
the next couple hundred years. They suggest
it would be dangerous to dismiss concerns


55
0:4:39,319 --> 0:4:44,0
of a potential robot uprising. So they are
going to spend time studying it. The potential


56
0:4:44,0 --> 0:4:49,33
dangers from biotechnology, artificial intelligence
and nanotechnology.


57
0:4:49,33 --> 0:4:53,43
It`s time for a "Shoutout" extra credit.


58
0:4:53,43 --> 0:4:59,16
Shrimp, crickets and scorpions are all members
of which of these groups? Here we go: are


59
0:4:59,16 --> 0:5:4,99
they all arthropods, vertebrates, cephalopods
or crustaceans. Put another three seconds


60
0:5:4,99 --> 0:5:8,61
on that clock and go!


61
0:5:8,61 --> 0:5:17,86
Shrimp, crickets and scorpions are all arthropods,
the largest phylum of animals. That`s your


62
0:5:17,86 --> 0:5:23,53
answer and that`s your Shoutout" extra credit.


63
0:5:23,53 --> 0:5:28,25
So, you might be like me and that you are
more used to seeing shrimp on a plate than


64
0:5:28,25 --> 0:5:33,849
in the wild. It turns out, any of those arthropods
could be served as food, though, the idea


65
0:5:33,849 --> 0:5:38,669
of crunching on a cricket or scarfing down
some scorpions might make your skin crawl.


66
0:5:38,669 --> 0:5:42,5
These bugs aren`t just edible, though. Some
experts are saying they are healthy. Dr. Sanjay


67
0:5:42,5 --> 0:5:43,599
Gupta dishes out the details.


68
0:5:43,599 --> 0:5:44,46
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


69
0:5:44,46 --> 0:5:50,21
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Silkworm
larvae stir-fried with soy, sugar and just


70
0:5:50,21 --> 0:5:51,979
a dash of white pepper.


71
0:5:51,979 --> 0:5:59,53
The silkworms have -- have texture of like
popcorn, and they have a creamy center. Bon


72
0:5:59,53 --> 0:6:1,4
appetite!


73
0:6:1,4 --> 0:6:5,5
Typhoon restaurant in Santa Monica is one
of a handful of restaurants right here in


74
0:6:5,5 --> 0:6:9,49
America that serves patrons bugs on purpose.


75
0:6:9,49 --> 0:6:15,33
Chilly-pepper seasoned crickets. Even scorpions
on shrimp toast.


76
0:6:15,33 --> 0:6:19,33
KEVIN OH, TYPHOON RESTAURANT: Scorpions still
have the stinger in them, but they are dried,


77
0:6:19,33 --> 0:6:21,599
so the poison is neutralized.


78
0:6:21,599 --> 0:6:26,71
GUPTA: Scorpions are just one of 1,700 bugs
that are safe for people to consume.


79
0:6:26,71 --> 0:6:32,47
It`s still a novelty here in the States, but
insects are part of a daily diet in most of


80
0:6:32,47 --> 0:6:37,69
the world. Earlier this year the United Nations
held their global conference on the benefits


81
0:6:37,69 --> 0:6:41,319
of eating insects, even suggesting it might
be a good solution to world hunger.


82
0:6:41,319 --> 0:6:45,139
OH: I don`t know why the United States doesn`t
eat insects, when they are actually very healthy


83
0:6:45,139 --> 0:6:45,849
for you.


84
0:6:45,849 --> 0:6:51,75
GUPTA: And he is right: insects are high in
protein, low in fat and cholesterol. Take


85
0:6:51,75 --> 0:6:58,22
a cricket, for example. A six-ounce serving
of these crunchy bugs have 60 percent less


86
0:6:58,22 --> 0:7:1,11
saturated fat as the same amount of ground
beef.


87
0:7:1,11 --> 0:7:2,46
OH: And now the ants.


88
0:7:2,46 --> 0:7:6,93
GUPTA: These string potatoes aren`t complete
without adding some dried ants.


89
0:7:6,93 --> 0:7:13,759
OH: They taste a little sour, tangy, and they
have a hint of black pepper to them.


90
0:7:13,759 --> 0:7:19,509
GUPTA: They also have 14 grams of protein
per serving. With the growing population and


91
0:7:19,509 --> 0:7:26,139
rising costs of food, the rest of the world
just might be on to something.


92
0:7:26,139 --> 0:7:29,9
Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN, Santa Monica, California.


93
0:7:29,9 --> 0:7:30,289
(END VIDEOTAPE)


94
0:7:30,289 --> 0:7:35,909
AZUZ: If you can stomach it, eating some bugs
might be healthy, but you know not to go dig


95
0:7:35,909 --> 0:7:39,9
in around your yard for dinner. Bugs in the
wild, they could be poisonous, they could


96
0:7:39,9 --> 0:7:44,31
be coated with chemicals. So you need to make
sure that you only eat bugs -- if you eat


97
0:7:44,31 --> 0:7:48,949
bugs -- that come from certified sellers or
restaurants.


98
0:7:48,949 --> 0:7:53,6
We didn`t expect to see people doing pushups
in here. But on the side of the road after


99
0:7:53,6 --> 0:7:58,34
getting in trouble with police? That`s what
got an investigation going in Rhode Island.


100
0:7:58,34 --> 0:8:3,169
Police say, a group of people between ages
15 and 18 vandalized the mailbox. And the


101
0:8:3,169 --> 0:8:8,8
video is blurry, but you can barely see them
here doing pushups. That`s what officers made


102
0:8:8,8 --> 0:8:13,11
them do instead of arresting them or filing
a report about the incident. But now the police


103
0:8:13,11 --> 0:8:13,93
are being investigated.


104
0:8:13,93 --> 0:8:14,409
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


105
0:8:14,409 --> 0:8:19,72
MAYOR CHARLES LOMBARDI, NORTH PROVIDENCE,
RI: We are not going to tolerate juveniles


106
0:8:19,72 --> 0:8:26,979
coming into town and knocking out mailboxes.
And at the same time, we are not going to


107
0:8:26,979 --> 0:8:32,909
allow our police officers to take the law
in their own hands.


108
0:8:32,909 --> 0:8:33,49
(END VIDEO CLIP)


109
0:8:33,49 --> 0:8:37,32
AZUZ: One of the accused vandal`s mother said
this: "the cop did wrong, but I`m glad he


110
0:8:37,32 --> 0:8:42,229
tried to teach my son a lesson. Personally,
I don`t think he should be suspended."


111
0:8:42,229 --> 0:8:46,36
Our affiliate spoke to some residents of the
area, many of whom seem to support the pushup


112
0:8:46,36 --> 0:8:51,459
punishment. Do you think police went too far
or that justice was served? Talk to us on


113
0:8:51,459 --> 0:8:56,779
our blog at cnnstudentnews.com, but please,
use only your first name.


114
0:8:56,779 --> 0:9:2,44
And finally, a gym in Orlando, Florida specializes
in helping certain family members keep fit.


115
0:9:2,44 --> 0:9:7,57
The four-legged ones. Fat cats and portly
poodles might seem cute and cuddly, but doctors


116
0:9:7,57 --> 0:9:11,899
say the extra weight could be taking years
off the pets` lives. Part of the problem is


117
0:9:11,899 --> 0:9:18,279
how much they eat and one solution for that:
hit the gym. This one`s got a pool, treadmills,


118
0:9:18,279 --> 0:9:18,88
Pilates equipment.


119
0:9:18,88 --> 0:9:23,6
This dog`s owner says he`s lost six pounds
in four months. It takes some effort to shed


120
0:9:23,6 --> 0:9:27,8
those extra pounds, but if it makes your pets
healthier, it could be well worth the weight.


121
0:9:27,8 --> 0:9:31,55
Yeah, just a couple of puns today. We really
had to scale it back a bit, but we know many


122
0:9:31,55 --> 0:9:35,2
of you find them uplifting, so we`ll work
out some more and have them ready tomorrow


123
0:9:35,2 --> 0:11:35,2
when CNN STUDENT NEWS returns.
