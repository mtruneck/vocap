###0 Hey Food Tubers! Since we're having such a good relationship
###7 and so much chemistry I thought to bring you here on our first trip like our mini honeymoon
###13 to this incredible place called Gualeguaychú, in the provence of Entre Ríos. And here,
###19 I will make for you guys a braised bondiola with a white and creamy risotto beside the
###26 river. Let me show you how to start. Here I have
###32 the meat - bondiola, pork. Situated, located on the back side of the neck. Now I will season
###40 it using pepper, some salt and drizzle it using olive oil. What we're going to do now
###48 is to take the meat to my Parrilla. Don't have a Parrilla? Don't worry, you can replace
###55 it using a grill. Now you will listen to the sounds of heaven. This is what we are looking
###61 for, the contrast between the crust and the inside which will be smooth, it will be soft,
###68 it will be wonderful. And what we are making here is to make it flying first class! We
###74 are making an upgrade to the pork! Come and look at this. Let me show you what I
###81 am talking about. This beautiful and amazing crust. While this is searing from all the
###89 sides, I will use a big pan and inside I will put baby carrots, small onions. This will
###97 be like the bed of our pork. Some thyme, good. And the amazing bondiola, incredible, amazing
###106 and tasty. Take it to your pan, spread a tablespoon of mustard, some sweet soya sauce. Look at
###116 this, look at the consistency. Now also, black beer! To the pan, 1 bottle. Look at this my
###129 friends! This is like a festival of flavours. And a party of all ingredients joining inside
###137 and sweet potatoes in syrup! I buy them on the market, you do not know where to get them
###144 you can just buy any fruit you like in syrup or if not you can replace it with any fruit
###151 you like. I will put them all because I like them very much and I'm also spreading in some
###157 of the syrup. Put on the lid, let them join the party and take this to the fire. Put it
###167 over here and now my suggestion - three hours. In three hours come and look at it like me,
###173 which I am going to do something else here in Gualeguaychú beside the river and we'll
###178 come back in three hours.
###193 I have just finished my test on the tractor
###197 driving licence. I had an excellent and now I can drive tractors everywhere. Now I didn't
###205 forgot about my bondiola. So now, I think it is almost ready I will prepare a white
###213 and creamy risotto. Very simple because all the flavours are here inside, as I told you,
###219 in this festival. Ok let's begin with the risotto. You have some butter, put it to melt.
###226 Half an onion. Take this onion to your pan - good. Now add two cups of rice, carnaroli
###237 rice. Look at this beautiful risotto rice. Now pour in one, two cups. That's ok. Mix
###247 it. It is very simple but we have to keep on stirring. Now add some stock, yeah baby!
###257 Some salt and pepper would be great. Pepper, salt! It will take around fifteen minutes
###265 to be ready. Keep on adding some stock when it requires. But now over here I have the big
###273 guest, my bondiola! Oooooh! Look at this, the liquids have reduced. Everything is of
###283 the colour of the beer! Super amazing. Look, these are shreds of glory.
###296 Mmmmmmm great!
###300 Now take a very nice dish or plate. Add a nice and generous spoon of your risotto. Now
###309 take your pork, take the flavours to the dish right now.
###318 Amazing! Now, the final touch,
###322 your nice vegetables, your beer, your mustard, oh my God! Good! Finish it up using some sprouts.
###331 Super amazing, look! This deserves to be eaten in a great spot. Mmmmmm, totally an upgrade!
