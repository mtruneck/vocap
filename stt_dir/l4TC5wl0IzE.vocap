###16 Excelsior, this is the shuttlecraft Sturgeon.
###18 Requesting docking coordinates.
###20 Acknowledged, Sturgeon, you are cleared for docking.
###26 Don't look so worried.
###29 Say that one more time, and I swear
###32 I'll bust you back to yeoman.
###35 What's on today's schedule?
###36 I've cleared it.
###38 You'll have all the time in the world.
###40 Docking is complete, Excelsior.
###42 Copy that, Sturgeon.
###44 Welcome aboard.
###45 All the time in the world...
###57 Tracking hydrogen-antihydrogen reaction signatures, Captain.
###61 There's no doubt they're venting antimatter.
###66 Maximum resolution.
###70 Range, Mr. Sulu?
###71 29 million kilometers, Captain.
###74 They've drifted well within the Romulan Neutral Zone.
###76 Another distress signal, Captain.
###77 They say they're losing life support fast.
###79 Mr. Sulu, plot an intercept course.
###82 I want us in and out before anybody's the wiser.
###86 Ever taken the Kobayashi Maru test?
###89 Course plotted and laid in, Captain.
###91 Full ahead.
###92 Aye, sir.
###98 Entering Romulan Neutral Zone.
###103 We are now in violation of treaty.
###105 Then let's not let any grass...
###107 Captain, warp field signatures approaching.
###108 Dropping to sublight.
###109 On screen.
###113 Romulan birds-of-prey,
###114 Imperator class.
###123 Detecting a build-up of hyperphasic energy, Captain,
###126 in a triangulated pattern.
###135 All decks-- Red Alert!
###150 Space--
###152 the final frontier.
###159 These are the new voyages of the Starship Enterprise,
###163 its five-year mission to explore strange new worlds,
###167 to seek out new life and new civilizations,
###171 to boldly go where no man has gone before.
###214 Spock! What the hell just happened?
###216 The merchant vessel has been...
###218 annihilated, Captain.
###220 There is nothing left.
###222 Its very atoms have been ripped apart.
###224 Get us out of here, Sulu.
###225 Yes, sir!
###232 Captain, I'm getting encrypted ship-to-ship
###234 between the Romulan vessels.
###235 Fortuitously, in a code
###236 they are unaware that we have previously broken.
###242 As I suspected.
###243 The merchant vessel was destroyed by a new weapon,
###246 most likely a prototype.
###247 Captain...
###248 they've spotted us.
###259 They're building energy again. We have only seconds before...
###261 Chekov, target those vessels and fire!
###264 Targeting... firing phasers.
###287 Damage report.
###288 Minimal, Captain-- mostly from shifts in our gravity field.
###291 Analysis, Spock.
###292 Shields are holding.
###293 We are safe for the moment-- but trapped.
###295 Trapped.
###297 How?
###298 We appear to be caught in a hyperdimensional field.
###305 The field is producing gravity waves...
###309 ...ripples in the space-time continuum.
###310 This is a strange definition of "safe," Mr. Spock.
###315 Lieutenant Uhura,
###316 send out a subspace message to the Romulan High Command,
###319 in their encrypted code:
###321 Weapons test a failure.
###323 Our own ships destroyed.
###325 Core breach... imminent.
###328 Aye, sir.
###330 We might at least dissuade them
###332 from trying it again, anytime soon.
###333 Most logical.
###335 Thank you, Mr. Spock.
###337 You, Bones and Scotty in conference now.
###340 Mr. Sulu, you have the Conn.
###349 Isn't the Kobayashi Maru
###351 supposed to be a "no-win" scenario?
###353 Let's hope not.
###358 The field apparently
###359 creates a quantum disruption
###361 that negates the strong and weak forces binding atoms.
###364 Anything caught within it simply ceases to exist.
###368 And this is going to happen to us?
###369 At the moment, our shields are protecting us.
###372 But the power drain is considerable.
###374 How much time? No more than 20 hours.
###377 I cannot say for sure, the way the levels keep changing.
###379 And we can't use full warp power to escape?
###381 Ineffective.
###383 Due to the field, we are in the grip of not four,
###385 but considerably more dimensions.
###387 We would need accurate coordinates
###388 for all of them
###389 in order to effectively extricate ourselves.
###392 And without the data on how the field was generated,
###394 the computer doesn't stand a chance of plotting a course out.
###397 Is it possible the bird-of-prey has the data?
###400 If the computer banks are still intact...
###402 but we can't access them from here.
###404 And with the field fluctuating to hell and back,
###406 I wouldn't dare trust the transporters.
###409 A shuttlecraft, then.
###410 Wouldn't it be destroyed?
###411 I believe we can extend the shields out
###413 far enough to protect it.
###418 Mr. Sulu.
###419 Aye, sir?
###421 We're going to need some fancy piloting
###423 if we're going to get out of this mess,
###424 with a few extra-dimensional coordinates thrown in.
###428 Are you up for it?
###429 When do I start?
###432 Captain's Log, Stardate 6283.6.
###435 The Enterprise is caught like a fly in amber,
###438 in a tangle of multiple dimensions.
###440 Our only hope of survival lies in obtaining data
###442 from the remaining Romulan bird-of-prey
###444 that might help us chart a course back to normal space.
###447 I have detailed Lieutenant Sulu
###449 to pilot a shuttlecraft to the derelict ship,
###451 accompanied by an expert in Romulan computer science.
###455 Sorry, sorry.
###458 You know, we are kind of on the clock here.
###460 I couldn't get into this damn thing.
###463 Lisa Chandris, computer science, xeno-cryptography.
###466 Hikaru Sulu, helmsman.
###468 I know; I saw you on the bridge, when I came aboard
###471 and presented my orders to the captain.
###473 I got here, like, three days ago,
###475 when you guys docked at Altair IV.
###477 Well, you're certainly starting things off with a bang.
###511 Keep them safe, Mr. Scott.
###523 What was that?
###526 Gravity wave.
###529 One of the first things they ask you
###531 when you sign on for starship duty
###533 is if you're prone to space sickness.
###537 I lied.
###539 We'll be back with the data before you know it.
###542 If our shields don't fail,
###544 and if that bird-of-prey isn't torn to quarks
###546 with us aboard it.
###548 That about sums it up.
###551 And that doesn't bother you, huh?
###553 It certainly motivates me.
###599 Sorry if I parked too far from the curb, Doctor.
###602 You're a real cowboy, you are.
###621 Careful. Gravity's unstable.
###630 Computer's on a separate power grid,
###631 so I should be able to...
###633 Okay, we're on line.
###634 Now all we have to do is locate the specific data
###637 on the weapons system.
###640 Ah, here we are.
###644 Of course!
###646 This making sense to you?
###648 It's complex, but yes.
###650 Good.
###651 I'd hate to have gone to all this trouble for nothing.
###654 I mean... almost nothing...
###667 Spock?
###668 Gravity waves, Captain.
###669 Increasing intensity.
###670 They could destabilize the bird-of-prey's reactor core.
###673 Sulu! You and Chandris get out of there now!
###691 Enterprise! Can you hear us? Enterprise!
###697 Bird-of-prey reactor core going critical!
###698 Scotty! Keep the shields extended around that ship
###700 and beam Sulu and Chandris back through!
###703 I'll give it my best, Captain.
###705 Spock! Bones!
###711 Gravity waves are makin' it devilish hard to lock onto them.
###724 The core just blew!
###726 Massive subspace interference.
###728 I cannot hang onto them!
###729 Wait. There's a signal.
###731 One's caught in the pattern buffer.
###733 Looks to be Sulu, but something's nee right.
###738 You're not gettin' away now, lad.
###791 You will stand down now, sir.
###796 You will stand down.
###798 And see, I believe, that you know us.
###805 Captain Kirk...
###811 Dr. McCoy...
###812 Bones.
###814 You're the same...
###816 How can you be the same?
###818 DNA and vitals match Sulu's, but...
###822 Jim-- he's 30 years older.
###826 Mr. Sulu, you've been gone less than a minute.
###829 The Romulan ship went critical
###830 and we tried to beam you both back...
###832 Oh, my God!
###834 She's all alone back there!
###837 You've got to get her!
###838 You've got to bring her here!
###839 We lost Dr. Chandris' signal.
###841 Not Lisa! Lisa's dead!
###844 She died 15 years ago.
###846 Captain!
###847 I'm picking up another signal, faint as a whisper...
###851 Dr. Chandris?
###852 Doesn't match her signature.
###854 Something else.
###855 Lock in on it!
###856 I'd do a fair bit better
###857 if you'd stop shoutin' and flailin' cutlasses about!
###859 Aw, you're a right will o' the wisp, you are...
###863 but you won't be gettin' away.
###872 Alana, don't be afraid.
###885 Bring her back!
###886 I've got her pattern in the matrix.
###888 She won't be gettin' away.
###890 But she's not exactly arrivin' here yet, either.
###893 I'll have to rig up some sort of stasis chamber to keep her here.
###897 At least, for starters.
###898 You called her Alana. Who is she?
###900 She's my daughter.
###905 Status.
###907 Shields at maximum, sir.
###908 We've diverted power from all but life support.
###909 We're holding our own, but we're not going anywhere.
###912 Understood.
###913 Report, Commander.
###917 Sulu, just tell us what you know.
###923 Lisa and I were aboard the bird-of-prey.
###927 It was about to explode when the transporter seized us.
###931 Instead of materializing on the Enterprise,
###934 we found ourselves on the surface of a planet.
###938 Clearly one with some form of civilization,
###940 given your elaborate... ornamentation.
###944 A dead world, Mr. Spock.
###946 Disease had wiped them out centuries ago.
###949 Nothing but ruined cities,
###952 what remained of a...
###954 canal system...
###955 desert that stretched forever.
###959 There was wildlife, fruits.
###963 We were able to survive.
###965 And in time, you and Chandris...
###968 There comes a point where one has to start living a life--
###973 whatever it is-- rather than waiting for one to begin.
###978 But what was 30 years to you
###980 was 30 seconds to us.
###981 Fascinating.
###982 It would appear that the gravitational waves,
###985 interacting with the multi-dimensional field,
###987 diverted you and Dr. Chandris
###989 into a different, more rapid timestream--
###991 perhaps a wholly different universe.
###994 Mr. Sulu,
###995 this ship will be torn to subatomic particles
###997 in a matter of hours,
###998 We need that data
###999 that you and Dr. Chandris got off that ship.
###1001 The tricorder's back on Caliban.
###1006 We had to name the planet something.
###1008 It seemed to fit.
###1011 It's from Shakespeare...
###1012 The Tempest.
###1014 Sulu, do you remember anything
###1016 from the Romulan data?
###1017 It's been so long.
###1020 I...
###1025 No.
###1029 When the tricorder's power started to fail,
###1032 I tried to hold the information in my mind.
###1036 But after months...
###1038 years...
###1041 Lisa thought... you had all died.
###1046 But I said, "You don't know James Kirk.
###1048 "He always manages to snatch life from the jaws of death.
###1052 He'll find a way."
###1054 You're that way, Sulu.
###1056 We need that data.
###1060 Captain...
###1065 Kirk here.
###1067 If you fine gentlemen
###1068 could tear yourselves away from your pressin' business...
###1070 there's someone here I'd like you to meet.
###1077 Father!
###1078 It's all right, Alana.
###1081 Why is she still insubstantial?
###1085 Best I can do for now, Captain.
###1087 A good part of her's still linked
###1088 to whatever godforsaken rock you were livin' on.
###1090 She appears to exist in a state of quantum indeterminacy;
###1094 partly here, in our universe,
###1097 partly still in the alternate universe.
###1099 That's impossible.
###1102 I suggest we make a datachip record of these events.
###1105 It could prove invaluable to science.
###1107 Welcome to the Enterprise.
###1120 They came.
###1122 They came for us.
###1125 Just like you said they would.
###1128 Captain, there are urgent matters we need to attend to.
###1131 I understand, Mr. Spock.
###1133 As soon as we're clear of this hyperspatial beastie,
###1136 we should be able to divert enough power
###1138 to bring you all the way through.
###1139 For now, unfortunately,
###1141 your movements are limited to this chamber.
###1143 We'll see if we can arrange some introductions later.
###1145 Miss...
###1146 Sulu?
###1148 Alana, please.
###1150 You're Captain Kirk, aren't you?
###1151 How did you know?
###1152 My father told me you were impressive...
###1155 ...and knew it.
###1158 You'll have to excuse her, Captain...
###1162 There's no apologies necessary.
###1165 Mr. Sulu, we'll need you in sickbay.
###1170 I'll try not to keep him long.
###1173 A pleasure meeting you.
###1175 Bones, Spock, you're with me.
###1179 I'll be back soon.
###1189 People move so quickly here.
###1192 Aye, that they do, lass.
###1195 You're Montgomery Scott, aren't you?
###1198 My father told me about you, too.
###1201 And just what did he tell you?
###1202 That he wouldn't want to be your liver.
###1208 It's good to have him back.
###1211 And to be meetin' his fine fair daughter.
###1216 Although you no longer consciously retain
###1219 the hyperspatial coordinates,
###1221 your mind still retains the data.
###1223 So... the famous Vulcan mind-meld.
###1227 I won't tell you this is without risk.
###1231 But then, what in life is?
###1238 Shouldn't you send me candy and flowers first?
###1241 I do not understand.
###1245 No, I didn't think you would.
###1251 My thoughts to your thoughts...
###1256 Sulu, relax. Don't fight it.
###1261 My mind to your mind.
###1265 Yes...
###1267 Our minds are merging, becoming one...
###1273 Yes.
###1275 The Romulan ship.
###1278 Dr. Chandris...
###1282 Alana...
###1285 A child...
###1288 ten years old...
###1291 What... What's...
###1292 sand... moving...
###1294 Rising up...
###1296 Alana!
###1299 Sand demon! Fangs! Spurs!
###1303 It has her!
###1304 Too far! Too far! I can't...!
###1308 Jim! Their vitals are spiking!
###1309 Lisa! She's killing it!
###1312 She's cutting it to pieces!
###1315 But it's stabbing... stabbing her!
###1318 LISA!
###1322 You saved her...
###1324 You saved our daughter...
###1326 She heard me...
###1329 I know she heard me...
###1332 Epinephrine level's off the scale.
###1334 Blood pressure's through the roof.
###1336 You have to stop it!
###1337 Stop it now-- before we lose them both!
###1340 Spock! Break it off!
###1342 Spock!
###1348 The data?
###1350 Too deep.
###1364 It's clear we'll have to find another way.
###1371 How is he?
###1373 Resting.
###1374 He'll need some time to recover.
###1377 My God, Jim, what he's been through...
###1381 Laudable as your tendency
###1383 toward compassion may be, Doctor,
###1385 it does not alter the fact
###1387 that the ship will be destroyed
###1388 if we do not get that data soon.
###1390 How can that green blood of yours be so cold?
###1392 Dr. McCoy...
###1393 Bones, we need an alternative.
###1396 Well, there are drugs, hypnotics.
###1398 They might work.
###1401 Normally, I'd advise against it.
###1403 These are not normal circumstances.
###1406 Do it.
###1407 They're not standard issue.
###1409 It'll take me time to formulate them.
###1412 In the meantime, I want you to get on with Plan B.
###1415 I was unaware we had a Plan B.
###1419 I trust you will shortly.
###1421 Understood.
###1423 Tell me, Captain, what did you do before you knew me?
###1426 I always made sure Plan A worked.
###1430 Ah.
###1433 While we're at it,
###1436 maybe you can arrange for a shave and haircut,
###1438 and rustle up a uniform for him.
###1440 It's the least we can do.
###1442 I wouldn't.
###1443 As far as he's concerned,
###1445 his tour of duty ended 30 years ago.
###1447 He's not the man he was.
###1450 I understand.
###1453 Captain Kirk to the bridge!
###1456 Kirk here.
###1457 The gravitational disturbances
###1459 are increasing faster than anticipated, Captain.
###1461 We're runnin' out of time.
###1463 Understood. Go to Yellow Alert. Kirk out.
###1466 If we're going to get out of this,
###1469 I have a feeling we're going to need the man that he was.
###1482 Captain, I've been monitoring fluctuations in the hyperfield.
###1486 And?
###1488 There is the possibility that,
###1491 were we able to generate a matter-antimatter negation burst
###1494 of adequate force to free us,
###1495 we might cause the field to implode.
###1498 And risk imploding the ship as well.
###1500 Our calculations must be most precise.
###1503 How much time do we have?
###1504 14 hours, 32 minutes and 24...
###1507 Then I suggest you start exploring it aggressively.
###1516 Didn't even give you an ocean view.
###1520 I'd complain to the management.
###1523 Oh, Father, it's wonderful.
###1525 You haven't seen much of it yet.
###1528 That doesn't matter.
###1530 We're here.
###1532 I just wish Mother could have seen it.
###1535 She would have given everything just for you to see it, Alana.
###1540 This is only the beginning.
###1542 Scotty will have you flesh and blood in no time, you'll see.
###1546 And then...
###1549 Centauri III, the Valles Marineris on Mars,
###1555 San Francisco--
###1558 all the places I've told you about.
###1561 We'll roll them out like a red carpet.
###1564 You can go anywhere,
###1566 do anything.
###1568 The whole universe
###1570 is ahead of you.
###1576 Forgive the intrusion.
###1578 Dr. McCoy's ready for you.
###1580 I'll be back soon.
###1588 Captain...
###1589 I expect you to behave yourself.
###1597 Your father always had a distinctive sense of humor.
###1600 Your reputation precedes you, Captain Kirk.
###1603 Call me Jim.
###1605 And just what exactly did he tell you about me?
###1609 How alone you were.
###1611 He told you I was lonely?
###1616 Well, that is the price of command.
###1620 It was more than that.
###1622 It was something you carried with you...
###1625 a distance...
###1629 Always a different girl on every world,
###1632 none mattering beyond the moment.
###1636 There was one who was different.
###1640 Her name... Edith.
###1649 Some things are best forgotten.
###1651 I don't talk about the past,
###1653 and your father shouldn't have, either.
###1654 I-I hurt you.
###1657 I'm sorry.
###1659 I'm not good with people.
###1662 Lack of practice.
###1665 It's just... he thought he would never see any of you again.
###1671 Life seldom takes us where we want it to.
###1676 Jim...
###1679 I understand loneliness.
###1684 You shouldn't try to banish memories.
###1688 They're how we live on.
###1691 They're all I have of my mother.
###1695 Did you know her?
###1697 She'd just come on the ship.
###1700 I'd seen her once or twice.
###1703 You'd have liked her.
###1706 She was funny...
###1709 and brave.
###1711 I know.
###1714 She died saving you.
###1716 She didn't hesitate.
###1721 I could never be that strong.
###1726 Well...
###1728 we never know what we can do...
###1732 ...until we have to.
###1738 Captain, if I may...
###1743 Excuse me.
###1749 Sensor scans of the external hyperfield
###1751 have proven inadequate to risk a matter-antimatter implosion
###1755 to free the ship.
###1756 What do you suggest?
###1757 The field surrounding Miss Sulu
###1759 seems a benign microcosm of the larger field.
###1762 If I might be allowed to take some measurements...
###1767 Mr. Spock would like to run some tests on you.
###1771 Will it hurt?
###1772 No.
###1775 I would've said yes anyway.
###1779 I'll see you later.
###1787 How do we start?
###1789 We already have.
###1796 One pharmaceutical cocktail coming up.
###1798 I swear, at times like this,
###1801 I feel like a bartender, not a doc--
###1806 Sorry, I didn't mean to, uh...
###1809 Oh, it's all right.
###1811 The only image I had of her was...
###1814 I understand.
###1816 Just lie back.
###1821 You'll feel a bit light-headed and drowsy...
###1826 Should I count back from a hundred?
###1829 Just say whatever comes to mind.
###1838 To be snatched away from everything you know,
###1841 dropped down in a wilderness,
###1844 have to build your life up from nothing,
###1847 with your bare hands...
###1853 ...only one thing will let you do that and survive.
###1860 Before all that,
###1862 I was on the career track to captain.
###1867 Friends were for off-hours...
###1871 hobbies mere diversion.
###1876 Family?
###1878 Not in the equation.
###1881 But then...
###1884 through the long nights,
###1889 we'd sit in the crystal towers...
###1892 listen to the wind wash over the dead sea...
###1898 gaze up at the twin moons...
###1903 share stories we remembered,
###1907 adventures we'd had...
###1912 I may have been lost...
###1920 ...but I was home.
###1929 It's a rare man that finds that...
###1931 and a lucky one.
###1936 Can I ask you a question, Mr. Spock?
###1940 I mean, if it doesn't distract you.
###1942 I'm not easily distracted, Miss Sulu.
###1945 What would you like to know?
###1947 Beyond that door...
###1950 there are hundreds of people.
###1954 And so far, I've only met six in my whole life--
###1959 four in the last two hours.
###1964 My father told me that you were
###1966 the only one of your kind on the ship.
###1970 Do you ever wonder what people think about you,
###1973 or what they see?
###1978 They will see precisely what you are--
###1980 a singularly astute and charming young woman.
###1986 But I'm so different.
###1987 We are, each of us, unique.
###1990 You must admit, some of us are a lot more unique than others.
###1994 It is grammatically incorrect
###1997 to place a modifier before "unique."
###2001 But nonetheless, you are correct.
###2004 Some of us are.
###2006 You still haven't answered my question.
###2013 I endure the pressures my choice of life demands,
###2015 because I prefer it to one of solitude...
###2019 ...and because I have found that I can tolerate being judged
###2023 far better than being of no consequence.
###2027 The scan is complete.
###2029 I must get this data to Mr. Scott.
###2033 So, am I one of a kind, Mr. Spock?
###2036 You are indeed, Miss Sulu.
###2045 Kirk to sickbay.
###2047 How're we doing, Bones?
###2049 Jim, I've tried every neural meta-mnemonic
###2053 in ship's stores on Sulu.
###2054 And?
###2056 Scattered bits and pieces, nothing you can use.
###2060 And I can't give him any more; his system can't take it.
###2066 I'm sorry, Jim.
###2076 How goes Plan B, Mr. Spock?
###2078 The readings I took from Miss Sulu
###2080 should allow us to attempt the negation burst.
###2082 As soon as Mr. Scott concludes his adjustments,
###2084 we can proceed.
###2089 Then I suggest you do so with all dispatch.
###2093 What's wrong?
###2095 Jim... Alana Sulu's atomic structure
###2099 is bound to the hyperfield.
###2100 We can't be certain she'll be coming with us.
###2103 Scotty said he'd be able to bring her over in time.
###2106 Time is a luxury we do not have, Captain,
###2109 and we may not have sufficient power for such an attempt.
###2112 Are you sure about this?
###2114 There are some variables in the readings.
###2116 The stronger possibility is that she will remain with the ship.
###2119 Still...
###2122 Thank you, Mr. Spock.
###2124 Should we inform Miss Sulu, or her father?
###2128 No... not yet.
###2131 But I expect you to do whatever you can to better her odds.
###2134 Of course.
###2135 For now...
###2136 is there anything we can do to make her more comfortable?
###2144 Are you still hanging around?
###2147 Don't you have anything better to do
###2150 than make fun of easy targets?
###2151 Well, we had a few moments before the implosion attempt.
###2154 I thought I'd drop by and give you a surprise.
###2156 A surprise?
###2157 Mr. Scott had some bored technicians he needed to occupy.
###2162 Would you care for a stroll?
###2187 What do you call this?
###2188 Deck 12-- it's not very imaginative.
###2191 It's perfect.
###2206 This.
###2209 What?
###2211 The best moment of my life.
###2216 Few people recognize it while it's happening.
###2221 All the better reason to notice it.
###2224 It's just the first of many.
###2236 It's a good look for you.
###2242 Uhura...
###2246 It's been forever.
###2250 My God...
###2252 What?
###2255 You're younger than my daughter.
###2259 Yeah, I heard about her.
###2261 She sounds wonderful.
###2264 She takes after her mother.
###2269 Uhura to the bridge.
###2274 Acknowledged.
###2286 We'll catch up later, okay?
###2293 Uhura.
###2295 Don't let it all go by.
###2310 If you've got your sea legs back,
###2311 you're free to go.
###2313 Thank you, Doctor.
###2323 Those aren't really necessary.
###2328 I know.
###2356 Bridge.
###2358 It's a turbolift.
###2361 It moves horizontally and vertically throughout the ship.
###2363 You command miracles and you don't even know it.
###2368 I'm starting to.
###2375 Alana!
###2380 Alana!
###2382 We had nothing like this on Caliban.
###2384 The name your parents gave that planet--
###2387 do you know where it's from?
###2389 My mother was in a production of The Tempest
###2391 when she was a girl.
###2393 She knew it by heart.
###2393 The sorcerer and his beautiful daughter,
###2396 marooned on an island until a ship arrives.
###2399 "A brave vessel, who had no doubt
###2402 some noble creatures in her..."
###2405 We'd perform it over and over.
###2407 With Sulu as Prospero...
###2409 and you as Miranda?
###2411 I preferred Ariel... who could fly.
###2417 And where would you like to go, Ariel?
###2419 Where would you take me, Jim?
###2432 Yes?
###2432 We're ready to initiate the implosion, Captain.
###2436 I'll be there momentarily.
###2438 Kirk out.
###2440 Another miracle required?
###2445 I'm afraid you'll have to return to the stasis room, for safety.
###2449 This device will beam you there.
###2451 Oh...
###2453 You'll see the bridge soon, I promise.
###2459 I'll hold you to that.
###2475 Where were you?
###2477 Jim arranged a tour.
###2480 "Jim"?
###2483 Are you jealous, Father?
###2490 Status, Mr. Spock.
###2493 Ready when you are, Captain.
###2496 This might be one of those rare times
###2498 when we actually get out of a tight spot
###2500 with some breathing room.
###2502 All decks, this is the captain speaking.
###2506 We're about to emit a plasma-antiplasma burst,
###2508 in an attempt to free the ship.
###2510 Brace yourselves.
###2514 At your discretion, Mr. DeSalle.
###2515 Aye, sir.
###2516 Detonation in five... four...
###2519 three... two...
###2521 one.
###2535 Alana!
###2541 Spock! What's happening?
###2542 Unknown, Captain.
###2551 Computer, analysis of implosion result.
###2553 Working.
###2555 Analysis indicates temporal discontinuity
###2557 caused by implosion.
###2559 My calculations predicted this possibility,
###2562 but not at this magnitude.
###2564 Just tell us what it means, Spock.
###2566 It means, Doctor, that we are still trapped,
###2568 but instead of hours, we now have only 32 minutes
###2571 before our shields collapse.
###2577 Sulu to McCoy! Emergency!
###2586 Captain's log, supplemental.
###2588 With drug therapy no longer an option to jog Sulu's memory,
###2591 and our time drastically reduced
###2593 by the implosion attempt,
###2594 our options are closing about us--
###2596 just as the field is closing about the Enterprise.
###2607 It's nothing, really.
###2609 I was just dizzy for a moment.
###2613 She's all right now,
###2615 near as I can determine.
###2619 Miss Sulu's molecular structure
###2621 is indeed linked to the exterior hyperfield.
###2624 If we fail to find a way to fully extricate her
###2626 before risking another implosion attempt...
###2628 Another implosion's not an option.
###2630 And without the navigational coordinates...
###2632 Gentlemen, I suggest
###2634 you come up with something original,
###2635 because we're not going to just count down the minutes
###2637 until this ship is destroyed.
###2639 Captain,
###2640 if Mr. Scott can lock in on the coordinates of Caliban,
###2644 it might be feasible to beam the entire ship's company there.
###2647 It wouldn't help the ship, but...
###2649 It would save the crew.
###2651 We'd be marooned there.
###2655 But alive.
###2657 And all in all, it's not that bad a life.
###2660 But if we lower the shields...
###2661 That might not be necessary,
###2664 given the higher dimensions involved.
###2667 Mr. Scott.
###2668 Aye, Captain.
###2671 Dr. McCoy, if I may examine the data on your tricorder...
###2675 Be my guest.
###2677 How are you feeling?
###2679 Like a fool.
###2683 So, tell me, back home, how are you set up for houseguests?
###2697 Kirk here.
###2698 Captain, can you get up here?
###2706 There's no way to duplicate the energy wave
###2707 that sent Sulu to Caliban.
###2709 It was a one-in-a-million freak accident.
###2711 None of us can beam there?
###2713 But I happened on something else.
###2715 Sulu's original transporter pattern.
###2717 The temporal field shift kept it intact.
###2719 Are you saying we might be able to reintegrate him?
###2722 As he was,
###2723 when we beamed him off the bird-of-prey.
###2725 It's possible-- theoretically, at least.
###2727 25 minutes to shield failure.
###2730 Get him up here.
###2733 It should be possible to reverse the aging process
###2736 by passing your current incarnation
###2739 through the pattern buffer.
###2740 Restoring, in effect, your last saved state.
###2743 Yes, I see.
###2747 I don't understand.
###2749 You mean you'd be giving him back 30 years?
###2752 No, we'd be taking them away.
###2759 I'd revert to the man I was
###2762 before your mother and I were transported.
###2767 As far as I'd be concerned,
###2769 the life we spent there would never have happened.
###2777 But the Romulan navigational data
###2779 will be fresh in your mind,
###2781 and you should be able to use it to pilot us to safety.
###2783 The memories would be gone.
###2788 I wouldn't know you.
###2790 20 minutes to shield failure.
###2795 You can't get rid of me that easily.
###2797 I'd be here to remind you
###2799 of every stubborn, mule-headed thing you ever did.
###2808 If it's the only way to...
###2812 Captain.
###2820 I'm sorry, Jim.
###2822 Alana?
###2826 I thought the only danger was the implosion.
###2828 I've been reviewing Dr. McCoy's medical data,
###2831 along with both my own scans
###2833 of Miss Sulu and the exterior hyperfield.
###2838 They'd best be getting a move on.
###2841 I've no mind to be trading my uniform
###2843 for a white robe at this late date.
###2847 I checked her medical readings.
###2849 There's no doubt, Jim.
###2852 Do we tell her?
###2858 We tell them both.
###2868 Captain, what is it?
###2870 Your atoms, your molecules,
###2873 everything that is you--
###2874 is still tied to Caliban through the hyperfield.
###2876 It's why you blacked out.
###2881 And should we succeed shortly in freeing ourselves,
###2884 the interference caused by our warp engines
###2886 will result in the field collapsing...
###2890 ...destroying everything still linked to it.
###2896 My God, do you know what you're saying?!
###2901 Yes.
###2903 You've got to beam her fully onto the Enterprise!
###2906 Now!
###2908 Not possible.
###2911 She is one with the universe that spawned her.
###2919 Then, can you beam me back?
###2924 No.
###2927 But were the ship to fail to extricate itself,
###2930 there is a 92.3% probability
###2933 the field would survive,
###2934 and you would be returned to Caliban.
###2937 She could live.
###2939 But 430 others will die.
###2947 There has to be another way.
###2953 I can't tell you what to do.
###2957 But you alone know the navigational coordinates,
###2960 and have the piloting skill necessary to save the ship.
###2968 I don't care who dies-- she lives!
###2972 Not this time, Mr. Spock.
###2975 Father...
###2977 I can't let you do this.
###2981 Alana...
###2983 Even if Mr. Spock is right, and I survive--
###2986 what kind of life would that be?
###2993 How can I go back to that empty world...
###2998 How can I live, knowing that you,
###3002 or that all of you, died because of me?
###3011 I don't know if there's an afterlife,
###3015 I don't know where we go when we die...
###3019 ...but if, Father...
###3024 ...it's not how long we live,
###3029 it's how we live that matters...
###3034 ...let my life mean something.
###3054 Do it, damn you!
###3063 Energize.
###3070 "Our revels... now are ended.
###3077 "And these our actors,
###3080 "as I foretold you,
###3082 "were all spirits...
###3087 "that are melted into air...
###3091 "into thin air...
###3098 We are such stuff..."
###3104 "As dreams are made on..."
###3141 Ten minutes to shield failure.
###3147 He's in massive shock.
###3149 We need him on the bridge.
###3150 What can you give him?
###3151 Two cc's of cordrazine.
###3153 Any more will kill him.
###3155 Get him to his station-- fast.
###3162 Jim.
###3165 In a minute.
###3177 My father told me you were impressive.
###3181 Alana, I...
###3183 Your ship needs you.
###3186 Is there anything that you'd like?
###3197 Two minutes to shield failure.
###3208 How young he is.
###3216 How handsome.
###3221 Hyperdimensional coordinates entered.
###3231 Artificial gravity compromised.
###3236 Life support system's on reserve power.
###3240 Acknowledged.
###3246 One minute to shield failure.
###3283 Ten seconds to shield failure.
###3286 Nine...
###3287 Eight...
###3288 Seven...
###3290 Six...
###3291 Warp drive engaged. Hold on!
###3313 We're free!
###3328 Free.
###3340 As you were.
###3347 How are you feeling?
###3349 A little rough around the edges.
###3353 Captain...
###3356 I'm told I attacked you,
###3359 tried to harm you.
###3363 There were extenuating circumstances.
###3375 I've watched this.
###3381 It's like it's happening to another person.
###3385 Alana...
###3389 My daughter.
###3392 The life I had...
###3397 There's nothing.
###3401 I'm sorry for your loss.
###3406 Did you get to know her?
###3411 Yes.
###3414 She was...
###3418 She was unique.
###3423 She lived her life fully in the time she had...
###3427 and gave it up for love.
###3432 What better epitaph...
###3436 could anyone ask for?
###3445 Oh, God.
###3449 If I could only remember.
###3452 Mr. Sulu,
###3454 when I attempted to extricate the data from your mind,
###3458 when our thoughts were joined...
###3460 I lived those years with you.
###3465 What are you saying?
###3468 They can be yours again.
###3471 But with the memories...
###3473 would come the grief.
###3486 Very well.
###3502 Alana?
###3514 Alana...
###3516 Captain?
###3518 Captain Sulu?
###3520 Yes, Ensign?
###3522 Your guests have disembarked from the shuttle, Captain.
###3525 Escort them to my ready room.
###3528 Aye, sir.
###3529 Rand, you have the Conn.
###3532 Aye, Captain.
###3535 Captain?
###3537 Yes?
###3539 You're a very lucky man.
###3556 "We are such stuff as dreams are made on..."
###3562 "And our little life is rounded with a sleep..."
###3569 Talking to yourself, Father?
###3572 I'd better keep a closer eye on you.
###3576 Demora.
###3579 Say hello to your granddaughter.
###3592 So beautiful.
###3598 The whole universe is ahead of you.
###3604 And I did as you asked--
###3606 with her name.
###3609 But... I don't understand.
###3614 Who's Alana?
###3621 You had a sister.
