1
0:0:7,807 --> 0:0:10,807
Hey!


2
0:0:10,807 --> 0:0:14,407
What? l didn't say anything.
l didn't do anything.


3
0:0:14,407 --> 0:0:22,727
What imaginary slight have you concocted
in that paranoid brain of yours?


4
0:0:22,727 --> 0:0:23,767
<i>Crap,</i>


5
0:0:23,767 --> 0:0:27,247
Shouldn't there be
some sort of sign...


6
0:0:27,247 --> 0:0:32,167
Look at that. You should put it back
down before someone slips and falls.


7
0:0:32,167 --> 0:0:35,207
Good, because l make most decisions


8
0:0:35,207 --> 0:0:38,967
based on your opinion. l'm thinking
of splitting up with the wife.


9
0:0:38,967 --> 0:0:43,887
Maybe you could mull that over.
Get back to me.


10
0:0:43,887 --> 0:0:46,247
Floor's wet, ma'am.


11
0:0:46,247 --> 0:0:49,767
Little help over here.
Little help.


12
0:0:49,767 --> 0:0:52,687
Move it or lose it, Q-tip.


13
0:0:52,687 --> 0:0:57,87
Q-tip. Cos you're skinny
and your head's fuzzy.


14
0:0:57,87 --> 0:0:58,847
Something's going down.


15
0:0:58,847 --> 0:1:3,407
Bring it in here, you knuckleheads.
Take a knee if you need to.


16
0:1:3,407 --> 0:1:6,727
l have been on since midnight,
so l stand here


17
0:1:6,727 --> 0:1:9,87
with my usual contempt for all of you,


18
0:1:9,87 --> 0:1:12,127
but with the added wrinkle
of having 1 3 cups


19
0:1:12,127 --> 0:1:16,207
of piss-poor excuse for coffee
passing straight through me.


20
0:1:16,207 --> 0:1:19,567
The not-so-hidden message being,
that if you screw up today,


21
0:1:19,567 --> 0:1:22,127
l'm going to hit you hard and fast.


22
0:1:22,127 --> 0:1:26,527
Now, then, l think some of you
may have noticed


23
0:1:26,527 --> 0:1:29,567
that all 27 of the patients
that were here in the lCU


24
0:1:29,567 --> 0:1:32,607
when l started last night
are still alive,


25
0:1:32,607 --> 0:1:35,367
and l intend
for them to still be breathing


26
0:1:35,367 --> 0:1:39,447
when l get the hell outta here
tonight at midnight.


27
0:1:39,447 --> 0:1:46,447
l think you understand what kind of
opportunity we have in front of us.


28
0:1:46,447 --> 0:1:49,87
- What opportunity...
- Shut up!


29
0:1:49,87 --> 0:1:51,167
ln baseball, when a pitcher's hot,


30
0:1:51,167 --> 0:1:53,687
no one talks to him,
just stay out of his way.


31
0:1:53,687 --> 0:1:58,87
- Why are you talking about baseball?
- Cos you should never jinx a pitcher


32
0:1:58,87 --> 0:2:1,807
when he has a chance
to throw a perfect game. My God, Barbie,


33
0:2:1,807 --> 0:2:4,927
how do you put your bra
and panties on in the morning,


34
0:2:4,927 --> 0:2:8,887
all by yourself?
lt's remarkable.


35
0:2:8,887 --> 0:2:28,167
- See, cos he's the pitcher...
- Yeah, l get it now.


36
0:2:28,167 --> 0:2:30,607
<i>A chance to be part</i>
<i>of a perfect game</i>


37
0:2:30,607 --> 0:2:36,207
<i>is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,</i>
<i>It just never happens,</i>


38
0:2:36,207 --> 0:2:38,567
<i>Which is why I don't mind</i>
<i>Dr Cox paging me</i>


39
0:2:38,567 --> 0:2:40,727
<i>for the 1 3th time this last hour,</i>


40
0:2:40,727 --> 0:2:43,487
<i>ICU is where</i>
<i>the most critical cases get turfed,</i>


41
0:2:43,487 --> 0:2:47,727
<i>So many patients die here you</i>
<i>think of death as another co-worker</i>


42
0:2:47,727 --> 0:2:52,47
<i>looking over your shoulder with the same</i>
<i>demands as everyone else you work with,</i>


43
0:2:52,47 --> 0:2:54,607
Dr Dorian...


44
0:2:54,607 --> 0:2:57,727
l know you're busy, but
my daughter's selling cookies.


45
0:2:57,727 --> 0:3:0,87
Put me down for two boxes
of mint thingies.


46
0:3:0,87 --> 0:3:2,127
She's in second place
in her troop.


47
0:3:2,127 --> 0:3:11,47
lf that girl who's in first keeps
doing well, we're just gonna take her.


48
0:3:11,47 --> 0:3:13,607
Did you think you were gonna cash it in?


49
0:3:13,607 --> 0:3:17,87
ln your face.
You're fine, thank you.


50
0:3:17,87 --> 0:3:18,767
Barbie.


51
0:3:18,767 --> 0:3:20,967
Whatever you need, l'm your girl.


52
0:3:20,967 --> 0:3:23,847
Get me 30 grams of Kayexalate.


53
0:3:23,847 --> 0:3:26,647
Don't dilly-dally trying
to refill your Prozac.


54
0:3:26,647 --> 0:3:29,407
You're on my time now. Go.


55
0:3:29,407 --> 0:3:32,687
Nervous guy. Go to bed 1 8
and get me his tox screen.


56
0:3:32,687 --> 0:3:36,247
Cross your fingers the news is good.
lf it's not, l'm blaming you.


57
0:3:36,247 --> 0:3:40,287
Newbie, start a drain on
the purulent pericarditis in bed 23.


58
0:3:40,287 --> 0:3:44,7
He's a tricky bastard. He's tried
to die five times on me today.


59
0:3:44,7 --> 0:3:47,167
- Keep an eye on him.
- l'm your wingman, Maverick.


60
0:3:47,167 --> 0:3:49,287
l was watching <i>Top Gun,</i>


61
0:3:49,287 --> 0:3:52,167
Did you know that Goose
is the guy from <i>ER?</i>


62
0:3:52,167 --> 0:3:55,247
No, l didn't.
But, but please, keep talking.


63
0:3:55,247 --> 0:3:58,127
<i>You have to keep</i>
<i>an eye on things around here</i>


64
0:3:58,127 --> 0:4:1,47
<i>cos just when it seems</i>
<i>everything's going great</i>


65
0:4:1,47 --> 0:4:7,207
<i>that's when the tiniest thing</i>
<i>can throw it all outta whack,</i>


66
0:4:7,207 --> 0:4:11,687
What are you doing? When the lunch lady
asked if you wanted fries, you said no.


67
0:4:11,687 --> 0:4:15,407
- Yeah, but l wanted fries.
- So why didn't you order fries?


68
0:4:15,407 --> 0:4:20,847
Cos l can't have French fries. Duh.


69
0:4:20,847 --> 0:4:24,567
Here. Have 'em all.
Have a fry salad.


70
0:4:24,567 --> 0:4:26,847
What the...? Turk?


71
0:4:26,847 --> 0:4:29,887
Baby, come on.


72
0:4:29,887 --> 0:4:37,447
Girlfriend, you know
l cannot have French fries.


73
0:4:37,447 --> 0:4:39,927
Dr Dorian, l need a favour.


74
0:4:39,927 --> 0:4:43,727
- l'm crazy busy today.
- That's just fine, kiddo.


75
0:4:43,727 --> 0:4:45,967
l won't make the board meeting today.


76
0:4:45,967 --> 0:4:49,847
l'm going to be tied up
at Dr Dorian's pity party.


77
0:4:49,847 --> 0:4:52,487
Should l bring something?
l could rent a clown.


78
0:4:52,487 --> 0:4:54,87
A drunk clown hurt me once.


79
0:4:54,87 --> 0:4:57,167
Just listen to the damn lawyer.
Go, Tom.


80
0:4:57,167 --> 0:5:0,7
lt's Ted.
But hey, it's only been 1 2 years.


81
0:5:0,7 --> 0:5:2,167
One of the social workers


82
0:5:2,167 --> 0:5:6,287
that covers this hospital slipped
and knocked herself unconscious.


83
0:5:6,287 --> 0:5:8,847
She might turn around and sue us.


84
0:5:8,847 --> 0:5:15,207
lf that happens, some of the
higher-ups' heads could roll.


85
0:5:15,207 --> 0:5:18,607
The point is that people
are less likely to sue an institution


86
0:5:18,607 --> 0:5:22,247
if we can put a friendly face on it.
You've got a friendly face.


87
0:5:22,247 --> 0:5:23,527
But, sir, l...


88
0:5:23,527 --> 0:5:26,87
Sacred Heart is calling for your help.


89
0:5:26,87 --> 0:5:32,847
Will you accept the call?


90
0:5:32,847 --> 0:5:37,487
This is a special phone. lf you don't
answer it, you get to be the intern


91
0:5:37,487 --> 0:5:40,407
who does the physicals
over at the state prison!


92
0:5:40,407 --> 0:5:41,687
Hello?


93
0:5:41,687 --> 0:5:45,167
- How are you? l'm Dr Dorian.
- Alex Hanson.


94
0:5:45,167 --> 0:5:46,767
Nice to meet you.


95
0:5:46,767 --> 0:5:49,647
Firm handshake. l like that.


96
0:5:49,647 --> 0:5:52,247
<i>Hello,</i>


97
0:5:52,247 --> 0:5:56,967
Mr Davis, l haven't seen you in three
months. lt's gotta be a record for you.


98
0:5:56,967 --> 0:6:0,207
lgnore the dislocated shoulder
and make small talk.


99
0:6:0,207 --> 0:6:2,47
This ought to help with the pain.


100
0:6:2,47 --> 0:6:4,887
So... what'd you do?


101
0:6:4,887 --> 0:6:9,287
Some woman just pushed me
off the bus. lt was totally unprovoked.


102
0:6:9,287 --> 0:6:11,127
Mr Davis.


103
0:6:11,127 --> 0:6:14,7
l may have told her
that she smelled like wet ass.


104
0:6:14,7 --> 0:6:16,87
There you go.
Be proud of who you are.


105
0:6:16,87 --> 0:6:19,447
- You wear too much mascara.
- You be careful now.


106
0:6:19,447 --> 0:6:22,207
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?


107
0:6:22,207 --> 0:6:23,847
Covering for...


108
0:6:23,847 --> 0:6:28,207
Whatever. 36-year-old male,
possible dislocated shoulder.


109
0:6:28,207 --> 0:6:29,967
Great.


110
0:6:29,967 --> 0:6:32,47
So, how are you doing?


111
0:6:32,47 --> 0:6:34,127
lt just got so cold in here.


112
0:6:34,127 --> 0:6:37,727
l think the swelling may have gone down.


113
0:6:37,727 --> 0:6:39,887
Yeah, l hope that hurts.


114
0:6:39,887 --> 0:6:43,527
- Oh, no.
- ls this the tox screen?


115
0:6:43,527 --> 0:6:45,847
This does not bode well for you.


116
0:6:45,847 --> 0:6:50,367
Get the results of Mr Chervin's
urinalysis. lf the numbers aren't good,


117
0:6:50,367 --> 0:6:52,847
l'm gonna give
one of your kidneys to him.


118
0:6:52,847 --> 0:6:55,887
Ten bucks says
l can make him wet himself.


119
0:6:55,887 --> 0:6:59,567
- Everybody's afraid of Mr Man.
- Laverne, you give good sass.


120
0:6:59,567 --> 0:7:2,87
l got the Kayexalate
and pulled the X-rays,


121
0:7:2,87 --> 0:7:4,767
so l am yours.
Do whatever you want with me.


122
0:7:4,767 --> 0:7:7,247
That came out wrong.


123
0:7:7,247 --> 0:7:10,767
l want you to use me.
l don't care how degrading it is.


124
0:7:10,767 --> 0:7:11,487
No, no...


125
0:7:11,487 --> 0:7:15,527
l know that you like torturing people,
and l am up for that.


126
0:7:15,527 --> 0:7:18,247
- l wanna make you happy.
- Marshmallow, hush.


127
0:7:18,247 --> 0:7:22,87
This guy needs a lumbar puncture,
and l need an extra set of hands.


128
0:7:22,87 --> 0:7:24,807
- Ready and raring.
- Ginger, get the lead out.


129
0:7:24,807 --> 0:7:26,647
Excuse me.


130
0:7:26,647 --> 0:7:30,207
- lt puts the lotion on the skin.
- You can do movies and l can't?


131
0:7:30,207 --> 0:7:33,87
lt puts the damn iodine lotion
on the skin.


132
0:7:33,87 --> 0:7:40,727
Mr Man!


133
0:7:40,727 --> 0:7:43,647
Dr Dorian, l owe you an apology.


134
0:7:43,647 --> 0:7:45,687
Obviously,
l was unclear when l said,


135
0:7:45,687 --> 0:7:48,87
''Stay in the MRl room
with that patient.''


136
0:7:48,87 --> 0:7:51,247
lt must have sounded like,
''Leave and do other things.''


137
0:7:51,247 --> 0:7:54,807
Let me rephrase it
so there'll be no more confusion:


138
0:7:54,807 --> 0:7:59,767
Get your ass back down there!


139
0:7:59,767 --> 0:8:2,207
You have no idea
how loud that is in here!


140
0:8:2,207 --> 0:8:6,567
l'm sorry. You'll be done in a second.


141
0:8:6,567 --> 0:8:8,647
Was that a good sound?


142
0:8:8,647 --> 0:8:11,687
- Not that good a sound.
- ls it stuck?


143
0:8:11,687 --> 0:8:14,927
''Stuck'' is a literal term.
lt's more like ''not moving''.


144
0:8:14,927 --> 0:8:18,487
- Pull me outta here!
- l can't. You were unconscious.


145
0:8:18,487 --> 0:8:23,767
You could have an injury.
Be glad you're not claustrophobic.


146
0:8:23,767 --> 0:8:27,247
- Promise you won't leave me.
- l promise.


147
0:8:27,247 --> 0:8:31,207
Dr Cox must have my pager on speed dial.
He's completely on top of me today.


148
0:8:31,207 --> 0:8:34,7
Do you know how much l wish
he was on top of me?


149
0:8:34,7 --> 0:8:36,87
That's naughty.


150
0:8:36,87 --> 0:8:38,567
You make me so mad,
l might actually scream.


151
0:8:38,567 --> 0:8:41,447
Every day you bitch
about how hard Dr Cox is on you,


152
0:8:41,447 --> 0:8:45,47
and you don't even realise
that you're his go-to guy.


153
0:8:45,47 --> 0:8:48,567
- You're overreacting...
- What has he had you do today?


154
0:8:48,567 --> 0:8:51,327
He had me intubate
and extubate Mrs Pollard,


155
0:8:51,327 --> 0:8:55,287
float a Swan on Mr Kalka,
a paracentesis, a radial art line,


156
0:8:55,287 --> 0:8:58,647
then place a transvenous
pacemaker for a heart block.


157
0:8:58,647 --> 0:9:4,687
Why? What did you do?


158
0:9:4,687 --> 0:9:8,647
Cream, no sugar.


159
0:9:8,647 --> 0:9:15,447
He takes his sugar, no cream.


160
0:9:15,447 --> 0:9:17,687
My arm is breaking!


161
0:9:17,687 --> 0:9:20,207
OK. lt's not going in.


162
0:9:20,207 --> 0:9:22,487
Really? Why don't we try kicking it?


163
0:9:22,487 --> 0:9:25,847
- l'll talk to one of our orthopaedics.
- Hurry back.


164
0:9:25,847 --> 0:9:27,927
That guy is the worst.


165
0:9:27,927 --> 0:9:30,647
Be nice. He's my boyfriend.


166
0:9:30,647 --> 0:9:34,87
- Not for long.
- Excuse me?


167
0:9:34,87 --> 0:9:36,887
He's been dying to run
outta here since he came in.


168
0:9:36,887 --> 0:9:40,167
- He did not run out of here.
- You're right.


169
0:9:40,167 --> 0:9:43,767
He was fleeing like he was being chased
by a swarm of killer bees.


170
0:9:43,767 --> 0:9:46,887
He said just keep pulling.


171
0:9:46,887 --> 0:9:48,847
Goody.


172
0:9:48,847 --> 0:9:52,247
Does this big metal contraption
make me look fat?


173
0:9:52,247 --> 0:9:55,47
More chunky than fat.


174
0:9:55,47 --> 0:10:0,687
- JD?
- lt's all right. l'm right here.


175
0:10:0,687 --> 0:10:2,967
You're such a nice guy.


176
0:10:2,967 --> 0:10:6,527
<i>It really feels like</i>
<i>there's something going on here,</i>


177
0:10:6,527 --> 0:10:9,767
<i>I wonder what she looks like,</i>


178
0:10:9,767 --> 0:10:12,847
Why am l always in your fantasies?


179
0:10:12,847 --> 0:10:16,527
You got a problem.


180
0:10:16,527 --> 0:10:18,927
Why are you squeezing
all my fingers?


181
0:10:18,927 --> 0:10:22,927
l'll tell you what l'm not doing.
l'm not checking for a wedding ring.


182
0:10:22,927 --> 0:10:26,447
<i>I am so in,</i>


183
0:10:26,447 --> 0:10:29,247
<i>I'm right back out,</i>


184
0:10:29,247 --> 0:10:31,927
l'm sorry about lunch.
l'm a little overtired.


185
0:10:31,927 --> 0:10:35,687
That's OK. When we get home,
we can go right to bed.


186
0:10:35,687 --> 0:10:37,567
That's the thing. l'm beat,


187
0:10:37,567 --> 0:10:44,487
so it'd be better
if you crash at your place tonight.


188
0:10:44,487 --> 0:10:48,447
lt's a private joke.


189
0:10:48,447 --> 0:10:50,527
- What now?
- Watch the attitude,


190
0:10:50,527 --> 0:10:55,7
or l won't let you go to the bonfire
with the beach bunnies.


191
0:10:55,7 --> 0:10:58,87
<i>I was probably thinking</i>
<i>about the MRI girl</i>


192
0:10:58,87 --> 0:11:3,287
<i>but I believe that giving a friend the</i>
<i>chance to shine was just as important,</i>


193
0:11:3,287 --> 0:11:7,567
Sir, it's Dr Kelso.
He's making me baby-sit this patient.


194
0:11:7,567 --> 0:11:17,327
lt's the bottom of the ninth. lf you're
not gonna be my catcher, who is?


195
0:11:17,327 --> 0:11:21,207
- What?
-<i>Play ball!</i>


196
0:11:21,207 --> 0:11:31,487
Come on, baby.
Right here. Bring it in.


197
0:11:31,487 --> 0:11:33,887
Dr Cox, you can trust me to help you.


198
0:11:33,887 --> 0:11:36,487
l was top five in my class.


199
0:11:36,487 --> 0:11:40,287
That's the noise
l make when somebody lies to me.


200
0:11:40,287 --> 0:11:42,127
But l'll get us this perfect...


201
0:11:42,127 --> 0:11:43,447
- Don't say it!
- ...game.


202
0:11:43,447 --> 0:11:46,167
What part of ''don't say it''
did you not understand?


203
0:11:46,167 --> 0:11:55,207
The ''don't'' or the ''say it''?
Help me to help you, Barbie.


204
0:11:55,207 --> 0:11:57,487
l should get to work.


205
0:11:57,487 --> 0:12:2,727
That would be lovely.


206
0:12:2,727 --> 0:12:5,567
- Elliot, do...
- No time!


207
0:12:5,567 --> 0:12:8,7
<i>We all have</i>
<i>important things to do,</i>


208
0:12:8,7 --> 0:12:10,607
Do you know what
Alex Hanson looks like?


209
0:12:10,607 --> 0:12:12,527
He's OK.


210
0:12:12,527 --> 0:12:16,47
l don't know.
l don't look at the ladies.


211
0:12:16,47 --> 0:12:19,287
Young man, l've been married
for over three decades.


212
0:12:19,287 --> 0:12:22,487
l would've gone there, though.
Hell yes, l would've.


213
0:12:22,487 --> 0:12:25,487
Who cares?
No one will ever love you.


214
0:12:25,487 --> 0:12:28,167
l don't find her pretty,
but since my wife left,


215
0:12:28,167 --> 0:12:34,87
when l look at a woman,
l find it hard to see past the evil.


216
0:12:34,87 --> 0:12:36,487
- Something's wrong.
- Nothing's wrong.


217
0:12:36,487 --> 0:12:39,287
You always say that,
then you sulk, then you tell me.


218
0:12:39,287 --> 0:12:42,887
You haven't known me long enough
for me to ''always'' do anything.


219
0:12:42,887 --> 0:12:44,367
You're always hurting me.


220
0:12:44,367 --> 0:12:48,167
- So now you're getting defensive?
- Woman, l am not defensive.


221
0:12:48,167 --> 0:12:49,927
You are, a little bit.


222
0:12:49,927 --> 0:12:56,7
Turk, why don't you just take a deep
breath and tell me what's wrong?


223
0:12:56,7 --> 0:12:57,567
That did it.


224
0:12:57,567 --> 0:13:3,727
l guess we're done here.


225
0:13:3,727 --> 0:13:6,167
Barbie, plates
are wobbling everywhere.


226
0:13:6,167 --> 0:13:8,607
l'm starting pressors.


227
0:13:8,607 --> 0:13:10,727
Or you could transfuse him.


228
0:13:10,727 --> 0:13:13,687
- Transfusions are riskier.
- My instinct was pressors.


229
0:13:13,687 --> 0:13:17,87
- Know what they say about instincts?
- Stick with them.


230
0:13:17,87 --> 0:13:18,447
- Should you?
- Should l?


231
0:13:18,447 --> 0:13:23,47
You'll have time to think about it on
the bench. That's where you're headed.


232
0:13:23,47 --> 0:13:27,407
Get out of here. Go ahead.
Go. Hippety-hop to the barbershop.


233
0:13:27,407 --> 0:13:30,47
''Should l?''


234
0:13:30,47 --> 0:13:33,87
Did she ask what you look like?


235
0:13:33,87 --> 0:13:37,447
No, she can tell l'm handsome.
l have a husky voice. ''Hello, baby.''


236
0:13:37,447 --> 0:13:39,887
Look into your heart
and see how it feels.


237
0:13:39,887 --> 0:13:41,767
My heart hates ''uggos''.


238
0:13:41,767 --> 0:13:44,167
That's what's wrong with you men.


239
0:13:44,167 --> 0:13:48,327
You're so afraid of what you feel.
l'm so sick of it.


240
0:13:48,327 --> 0:13:50,807
So do you know
what she looks like?


241
0:13:50,807 --> 0:13:53,7
Yeah, l do.
But l ain't telling you.


242
0:13:53,7 --> 0:14:0,47
Just tell me. Does she look
anything like Jimmie Walker?


243
0:14:0,47 --> 0:14:3,687
l'm noticing the bottoms
of your slippers are rather slick.


244
0:14:3,687 --> 0:14:7,807
Perhaps they contributed in some way
to the incident this morning.


245
0:14:7,807 --> 0:14:10,927
Those are hospital booties,
you moron.


246
0:14:10,927 --> 0:14:13,287
And now l'm a moron.


247
0:14:13,287 --> 0:14:17,447
Dr Dorian, why don't you take Ms Hanson
out for a lovely dinner?


248
0:14:17,447 --> 0:14:20,727
Dr Kelso, l'm not suing the hospital.


249
0:14:20,727 --> 0:14:23,767
lt turns out
l only have a mild concussion.


250
0:14:23,767 --> 0:14:25,767
Alex? He's gone.


251
0:14:25,767 --> 0:14:30,287
So, what restaurant
are you taking me to?


252
0:14:30,287 --> 0:14:33,607
<i>You're not bad if you want to wait</i>
<i>and see what she looks like,</i>


253
0:14:33,607 --> 0:14:36,447
l'm kidding. You don't have
to take me out to dinner.


254
0:14:36,447 --> 0:14:41,47
Are you sure? Cos... OK.


255
0:14:41,47 --> 0:14:43,127
l gotta go. Sorry.


256
0:14:43,127 --> 0:14:46,487
Don't sweat it.
We'll see each other around.


257
0:14:46,487 --> 0:14:48,767
JD, l'm really glad you were here...


258
0:14:48,767 --> 0:14:51,647
Ms Hanson, he's gone.


259
0:14:51,647 --> 0:14:56,7
lf l were in your slippers, l'd sue
this hospital for all it's worth.


260
0:14:56,7 --> 0:14:57,207
Really?


261
0:14:57,207 --> 0:15:1,767
We could run away together.


262
0:15:1,767 --> 0:15:6,847
You know what to do. Be straight
with Carla, no matter how hard it is.


263
0:15:6,847 --> 0:15:10,607
l hate this part.


264
0:15:10,607 --> 0:15:13,807
l just don't know
what to do about Dr Cox.


265
0:15:13,807 --> 0:15:17,647
- What is going on here?
- l say one thing, he says the other.


266
0:15:17,647 --> 0:15:19,527
l can't take it any more.


267
0:15:19,527 --> 0:15:23,47
Why don't you become a lesbian,
and hook up with some hot model?


268
0:15:23,47 --> 0:15:27,47
- What's that got to do with anything?
- l just thought it'd be hot.


269
0:15:27,47 --> 0:15:32,647
He's testing you. You can't be afraid
to disagree with him.


270
0:15:32,647 --> 0:15:37,447
- You're afraid.
- But l still do it.


271
0:15:37,447 --> 0:17:23,607
Get back in the game, Elliot.


272
0:17:23,607 --> 0:17:27,687
Dammit!


273
0:17:27,687 --> 0:17:32,687
So close. Dammit!


274
0:17:32,687 --> 0:17:34,367
l'm sorry.


275
0:17:34,367 --> 0:17:40,487
l'll be fine.


276
0:17:40,487 --> 0:17:43,247
Perfect game.


277
0:17:43,247 --> 0:17:44,327
Call it.


278
0:17:44,327 --> 0:17:48,367
There's five minutes left, just
the two of us here. Can't we just wait?


279
0:17:48,367 --> 0:17:53,327
Just call it.


280
0:17:53,327 --> 0:17:54,887
No.


281
0:17:54,887 --> 0:17:57,87
We all need this, so, no.


282
0:17:57,87 --> 0:17:59,807
l won't call it.


283
0:17:59,807 --> 0:18:4,447
That's the dumbest thing anybody's
said to me around here in a long time.


284
0:18:4,447 --> 0:18:9,127
There's nothing wrong with a one-hitter.
ln fact, it's miraculous.


285
0:18:9,127 --> 0:18:13,367
l won't have you cheapen what should
be an endless pursuit of perfection


286
0:18:13,367 --> 0:18:16,767
just because you want the world
to laugh with you tonight.


287
0:18:16,767 --> 0:18:18,207
Now, call it.


288
0:18:18,207 --> 0:18:21,687
Time of death, 1 1 .55.


289
0:18:21,687 --> 0:18:23,807
Good girl.


290
0:18:23,807 --> 0:18:26,487
Better go get
yourself a cup of coffee.


291
0:18:26,487 --> 0:18:35,647
New game starts in four minutes.


292
0:18:35,647 --> 0:18:37,967
Hey, Carla.


293
0:18:37,967 --> 0:18:40,487
Carla, wait!


294
0:18:40,487 --> 0:18:41,927
Where are you going?


295
0:18:41,927 --> 0:18:45,7
l'm gonna go crash at my place
tonight, like you said.


296
0:18:45,7 --> 0:18:47,407
You want to know?
That's what's wrong.


297
0:18:47,407 --> 0:18:50,207
''l'm gonna go chill out
at my house, like you said.''


298
0:18:50,207 --> 0:18:52,247
God, you're so sexy right now.


299
0:18:52,247 --> 0:18:55,767
l've been doing a lot of thinking.
And, you know...


300
0:18:55,767 --> 0:18:58,767
We're past that new,
exciting relationship phase,


301
0:18:58,767 --> 0:19:0,687
and all that's left is us.


302
0:19:0,687 --> 0:19:3,207
Baby, l gotta tell you,
you drive me crazy.


303
0:19:3,207 --> 0:19:7,367
You take my French fries, you boss
me around in front of my friends.


304
0:19:7,367 --> 0:19:9,807
You said strong women turn you on.


305
0:19:9,807 --> 0:19:15,167
We know what you're gonna do,
so why not do it so l can go home?


306
0:19:15,167 --> 0:19:21,567
OK.


307
0:19:21,567 --> 0:19:24,807
l love you.


308
0:19:24,807 --> 0:19:27,687
You annoy me more than
l ever thought possible,


309
0:19:27,687 --> 0:19:33,407
but l want to spend every
irritating minute with you.


310
0:19:33,407 --> 0:19:35,167
Me too.


311
0:19:35,167 --> 0:19:37,927
Yeah?


312
0:19:37,927 --> 0:19:43,247
l love you.


313
0:19:43,247 --> 0:19:45,607
l don't get it.
Why are you doing this to me?


314
0:19:45,607 --> 0:19:49,727
All l wanted to do was have sex
with a foxy nurse, and now l'm in love?


315
0:19:49,727 --> 0:19:56,87
Sweetie, that happens.


316
0:19:56,87 --> 0:19:59,207
<i>I've been thinking lately</i>
<i>about taking chances,,,</i>


317
0:19:59,207 --> 0:20:2,407
Run a tox screen and
a full blood workup for the guy in 37.


318
0:20:2,407 --> 0:20:4,7
You can handle that?


319
0:20:4,7 --> 0:20:5,487
- Yeah.
- Good girl.


320
0:20:5,487 --> 0:20:9,807
Up on the second floor... There's a
laundry list of stuff l want you to do.


321
0:20:9,807 --> 0:20:12,687
<i>,,,and how it's just</i>
<i>about overcoming your fears,</i>


322
0:20:12,687 --> 0:20:15,687
<i>Because every time</i>
<i>you take a big risk in your life</i>


323
0:20:15,687 --> 0:20:21,287
<i>no matter how it ends up</i>
<i>you're always glad you took it,</i>


324
0:20:21,287 --> 0:20:23,487
Wait! Stop the machine.


325
0:20:23,487 --> 0:20:27,167
- What the hell are you doing?
- Will you go out with me?


326
0:20:27,167 --> 0:20:29,687
lf l say no, will you
let me out of this thing?


327
0:20:29,687 --> 0:20:32,167
- lt's iffy.
- Then l guess l have to say yes.


328
0:20:32,167 --> 0:20:41,527
- So say it.
- Sure. l'd love to.


329
0:20:41,527 --> 0:22:41,527
Huh?
