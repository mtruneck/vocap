###523 they had to be

###529 archaeologists have discovered that the builders dot the boss trench nearly
###532 fifty meters wide around the lake
###536 sinking into six meters below the next day
###539 highlighted the trench with stone walls three meters thick

###764 soldiers marched tens of thousands of genes back to rumors slayings
###769 there is a popular myth but they were forced to work on the coliseum
###773 but the truth
###775 is more complex
###777 does not mean likely you just bring over huge workforce thirty thousand jews to
###781 build the coliseum
###783 that was taking too long or the taking too long
###784 trained and this is not about on-the-job training
###787 in the policy is all about being efficient and fast in getting it done
###794 real values the slaves to the cities you know
###796 was money
###798 thirty thousand jewish prisoners and to the world in chains
###804 total public parade
###805 and
###808 they were sold
###811 there was a ready mark
###814 slaves were an integral part of her life
###818 a rich from a montana several hundred
###821 but even the average citizen could afford a housewife
###825 the race card to nation
###826 what without slates slaves a part of their lives and it's part of this
###830 five-c_
###831 it's their expectations
###833 if you sell thirty thousand slaves you get past huge amounts of money would go
###837 away
###838 the labor of the third of the population of writing for a whole year it is
###842 something which then he can catchy
###855 aunt espy's ian would need has returned to painting for his coliseum
###860 williams were
###862 constantly will organized
###865 professor michael davis isn't architectural historian from mount
###868 holyoke college in the united states
###872 he's in and out about the manpower quiet
###875 it's been estimated that
###876 uh... perhaps as many except quarter of the population of loan
###880 was involved in some ways or other
###886 homes interviews were accomplished buildings
###889 this would be the greatest challenge
###893 they needed a nafta theater beacon strong enough to hold over fifty
###896 thousand people
###897 without collapsing under its own weight
###902 the solution late in three ke architectural innovations that formed
###906 the secrets of rooms great monuments
###909 the most important
###910 is the bachche
###912 he launches an almost perfect designs daring halos
###917 and that designed so simple
###920 a series of when she blocks is assembled together in a semi circular forum
###925 and supported on top of tubular spot the side
###930 the weight of the building is absorbed by the keystone the center of the march
###935 and distributed evenly over the entire span of the margin went down into this
###941 tubes side pillars
###944 this allows the pillars to bear enormous loads
###948 and because displease in between the killers instantly
###952 this reduces the weight of the building even further
###956 starts would become hooked
###957 greenstein throughout the building with the coliseum
###962 eighty gigantic auctions seven meters high
###965 former judge removed on the perimeter
###969 on top of the secession other eighty patches on top of the uses of food
###972 making two hundred
###973 forty arches in or
###977 the coliseum really
###979 is nothing
###980 but arches it's symphony
###983 of arches
###992 uh...
###999 the organization required to achieve his feet of engineering was phenomenal
###1004 even here brooms engineers had a trickle to a determines
###1009 building was a business of mass production
###1012 standardization uski efficient building of the cards
###1015 for example the romans used the arch and artistic p_d_ again to begin weekend by
###1020 countless teams
###1022 of builders and that kind of standardization
###1024 is very keen to what we have been in industrialized world today
###1030 breaking down of the building allows them to have lots of workdays
###1035 you skills to just disagree with it
###1040 in this way
###1040 thousands of labor is working on the policy that could be left to build a
###1044 section with minimal supervision
###1047 confident in the knowledge that made this would be repeated pulled over the
###1051 structure
###1052 it and have a lot of unskilled
###1054 levers you could have a lot of prickly you can have a lot of people
###1058 that's have some sort of skill
###1060 all but they're not going to be
###1061 replied no more than a whole lot
###1064 they didn't have a lot but still leaves people they're going to be carvings
###1067 columns people they're going to be carving the statues that are going to go
###1070 and it is in the upper floors
###1072 steven have a lot of skill classmate
###1075 if they have a lot of unskilled people participating in this very massive
###1079 important instructions
###1086 the concept of repetition was at the heart of the coliseum is design
###1091 the architects put to theaters back-to-back to create one john and
###1094 theater in the round war
###1096 and if the actual since the greeks contact
###1101 is trying to remember to acquire encountering
###1104 eighteen options
###1109 this estee seems engineers planned for the six concentric rings of options
###1114 written into the center of the coliseum
###1118 the space between the central beans was bound together with rough looks a bulk
###1122 annexed to fire
###1124 versatile building style
###1127 peaceful in the case
###1128 of the superstructure
###1132 but even building with options would require an enormous amount of stone
###1139 more than two hundred thousand tons of limestone would be used to
###1143 policies
###1146 subtly
###1147 liberty schools particularly brooms doorstep
###1150 macquarie citizens
###1152 thirty-five column inches away iliad natural instincts nervous travertine
###1158 which could be cut institute karti two-room
###1163 the material has to be coming in
###1165 to the cd cards day in india
###1168 rosen rosa parks heart travertine still many carved by b
###1173 hundreds and hundreds of still in part
###1176 in fact his estimate of the two hundred carts making dietrich specific six who
###1181 used to transport systems of the site
###1186 stone arches made a building with the coliseum possible
###1191 but it was so she chick the building still face the unthinkable
###1197 if it was made entirely understand
###1200 mystery seems grand arena could simply crumbled
###1204 under its too late
###1208 it
###1214 eighty seventy five
###1217 the coliseum has been under construction for five years now the scale of the
###1221 project is becoming clear
###1226 the buildings and he's convinced me to finds it together
###1231 beaches more tourism tourism controlled the part of intelligence
###1236 grumman continue to solve the problem
###1239 mixes
###1239 folk access
###1241 but the more times down
###1245 they called it cooper's sick leave
###1248 request
###1249 concrete
###1250 use completely revolutionized
###1252 roman architecture
###1254 so what you have to ease this material that he she feeds you
###1258 at parts
###1259 or faults
###1260 so it's very fluid and contains on
###1263 uh... for idea of shapes and this is what i think again white battle in such
###1268 a distinctive quality to roman architecture
###1273 it's main advantage
###1274 his versatility
###1276 concrete was much stronger than traditional molter
###1279 responses
###1281 and waterproof
###1282 much liked instead
###1284 throughout the rooms to create a lightweight version of the college
###1289 ideal for spamming largest pieces
###1293 like those between the crucial structural beams
###1297 concrete was also used to create the superstructure on which the city was
###1301 late
###1303 and it allows the seating to be raised two key optimum angle for the spectators
###1309 so minorities sleepers in angola thirty degrees rising to fifty five degrees
###1315 thirteen
###1318 that's great
###1319 spectators at the back quickly review of the people
###1323 vinod verma
###1327 but the seating plan at another time
###1331 seating
###1332 because see unlike the seeking a different standard building
###1335 inbred world
###1336 has a hierarchy of weight you've got it
###1341 at the very firm to the stadiums the podium
###1343 web room senators have reserved seats
###1350 behind them
###1351 on nine terraces of model seats puts it the equestrian is rooms business class
###1357 these aristocrats chose not to into politics so they could concentrate on
###1361 the business of making money
###1366 must belong to the families of the senators in front of him
###1372 into tears about sethi ordinary citizens of road packed together along twenty
###1376 miles thirty terrorists
###1381 this is that
###1382 limits of the space isn't subregional amphitheater but it sounds out of the
###1386 fifteen years working terraces to which the poorest members of roman society
###1390 will relegated
###1393 so the coliseum would be much more than just a sporting arena
###1398 it'll be a microcosm
###1400 society
###1402 as you go up to say
###1403 will lie in all of these where do i fit in
###1407 spelled out to a precise position in the higher
###1412 received
###1413 right around that into see uh... the whole populace of rome
###1417 city where they were supposed to
###1425 but with a build still in its infancy
###1427 species as engineers would bristling with more fundamental boxes
###1433 concrete wasn't suitable for every structural job
###1436 they still needed like sweet alternative that would be a strong stone
###1442 what we turn to
###1443 so monday
###1444 so common to lot everyday lives
###1447 renewed on the even notice it
###1451 it's a good revolutionize the way the buildings were made
###1456 the romans
###1458 invented to read to bring
###1461 the romans traditionally used terra cotta
###1464 the red clay found throughout the mediterranean today
###1467 roofing tiles
###1470 they started experimenting
###1472 ray mysteriously take
###1474 details of the bridges
###1476 in houston as facing material or involves in architecture
###1481 and this leads the news review possibilities and ways of building the
###1485 haven't existed before
###1488 nowhere uses more obvious that the coliseum
###1492 these everywhere
###1494 and when combined with concrete
###1496 he gave the ever-present uh... chin
###1499 which is so important to the coliseum a whole new lease of life
###1505 the romans skillfully combined different materials
###1509 to build structures that were very large and high
###1513 off the ground for at least built
###1515 but he's still not arches to support the weight of the structure above
###1520 using the language reveals a brick and concrete
###1523 they've built a second
###1524 level of arches about that
###1527 and then the third level of arches about that
###1531 they could plant your point era arches to build structures that were higher n
###1536 lighter than any that have been built before
###1542 but building a types of up to fifty meters had created yet another child
###1548 new cream existed that could lift building materials so high
###1553 the whole she go to the construction the coliseum
###1556 uh... resides in the fact that we have
###1558 before main stories we can see right over here that we have the first story
###1561 with a series of arches
###1563 than we have the people standing robert second-story and it didn't work out for
###1567 and that's where you put it you're praying to get more building material
###1571 and working on that level
###1572 building up the next week
###1575 to move all this material groomsmen peter cantik cranes operated by large
###1579 trade
###1584 he seems to clean genius block and tackle system
###1587 depicted in accounting for the time
###1589 too pleased to have you got
###1590 onto the platform
###1592 and summed up by forwarding the same thing you're pushing at the cranes are
###1595 putting up a building materials and working on that very clear
###1598 finally you're able to work on the top floor
###1601 at that point they getting
###1602 quite high yes
###1612 there are more than a million breaks in the coliseum
###1616 to keep the project on the track
###1618 the romans needed to produce bricks and a terrific right
###1624 the solution is something we can will recognize today
###1629 governments purchased at bricks in factories all over the city
###1633 he's recalled fabricate
###1636 two thousand years before henry ford
###1639 improvements they devised the production
###1643 the building of the coliseum round like of well loyalty mission
###1648 so you can imagine that
###1649 as this goes up units stories you've got things are still going on in the lower
###1654 floors like decoration on the vaults the painting in the stock going into self
###1659 this is going on for you here's in years and years
###1664 given
###1670 coliseum project would consume the whole of room for more than a decade
###1676 and ultimately outlived its creator
###1682 in eighty seventy nine improve the spacing
###1685 the man whose vision that made between the reality
###1689 dies
###1693 as room mourns the loss of its popular and
###1696 is some titus takes the throne
###1699 he decrees that his father's great amphitheater will
###1706 the new emperor
###1708 has just said his workers
###1720 the builders of the coliseum and they seem to compute the stadium in time for
###1724 its king local games
###1726 they have only partially succeeded
###1731 as the students to learn from the time shes
###1733 it's still missing sometimes for
###1737 true to role in tradition
###1739 this building probably wasn't even told we can't just so you have many
###1743 inaugurations many dates in which the people show up and you still have a
###1746 staffing up by the staffing behind
###1749 exp teaching team
###1753 first still
###1758 now brooms coliseum opens for business
###1762 must have been locked spectator
###1766 really got everyone's attention
###1767 was the scale
###1770 gleaming white
###1771 no one's been here before your inaugurates place
###1774 all of this would an incredible spectacle
###1776 every sports fan in room is clamoring to see the including sc
###1780 tens of thousands of people
###1782 crowd outside the stadium
###1785 newspeople safely and quickly to the seeds
###1788 will be a mammoth task
###1790 the coliseum still does
###1792 of cracks the proper
###1794 on the northwestern corner
###1796 there five bwz embedded into the pavement
###1800 all that remains of distinctions crowd control system
###1804 this is to keep people back
###1806 prior to entry this is where you could check the people going aight
###1811 it what people think so they can't be directed
###1814 towards the right numbered gateway
###1816 didn't feel coliseum itself
###1820 just like a modern spectator today
###1822 every room in the coming to the games was issued a ticket
###1825 deficit to them
###1828 that's about one of the total which of the seventy-six stadium entrances to use
###1833 you can still see many of the intrigued and discarded into the stand above the
###1836 entrances today
###1839 they have used a crafty trick
###1841 up the excitement
###1844 i think that the seating was deliberately restricted it was a tough
###1847 ticket to get
###1849 and opt for a specially for the big games
###1854 these tensions
###1855 is dedicated to a certain sectors of the society
###1858 the more important to her
###1860 these here it was to get a seat
###1865 entered through a richly decorated came to the south side
###1868 which was later replaced by an underground passageway direct to his
###1871 house
###1874 the grand entrance opposite allowed rooms official magistrates to walk
###1878 straight to bed bugs
###1880 right next to the arena
###1884 this entrance was shared by the senators
###1887 over the next step down in the pecking
###1889 people sit in georgia ringside
###1895 in each culture of the stadium three gates who is a
###1897 further questions
###1899 and in a corridor commercial flight of stairs bullpen out into their seats
###1906 ordinary citizens of rome had to let them pass before it using the remaining
###1910 fourteen gates to spiral up several flights of stairs onto the terraces
###1919 just stoked up
###1920 thirteen eight steps to get to the wooden benches
###1926 so if your plan
###1927 and upload without money keeping or even a slave on the day off you're going up
###1931 to the newest but since there are no elevators you could have the pulpit all
###1934 the way up there
###1935 in your view that can be a good deal
###1938 this extremely efficient system
###1940 maintained a constant flow of people eliminated choke points as much as
###1944 possible
###1946 it's been estimated that
###1947 the fifteen fifty five thousand people that would feel the coliseum uh... could
###1952 exit within half an hour that kind opt for active called efficient planning
###1959 hasn't been surpassed today and in many ways still provides a kind of model
###1965 uh... four uh... modern steel design
###1970 listen sign consent
###1973 but when it was first okay
###1975 onto the computer
###1976 court economists
###1977 besides and hans the since the practice
###1980 constraints
###1988 and the stadium corridors winter storm in the spring
###1991 everywhere he went to pick a random approves this whole thing selling every
###1995 kind of merchandise civilians fast food
###2000 sex you name it
###2002 they've got it because several for
###2004 was the gladiators
###2006 justice with boldness for stocks
###2008 there is merchandising all of packet we find gladiators appearing on raymond
###2013 land speed fine
###2015 gladiators born strom speak freind literally soldier like traci exits for
###2021 aids
###2021 and these are extremely popular that's a great souvenirs
###2024 and you think that when these people
###2026 were the superstars update date
###2028 they're being in recognized
###2029 fourteen so many ways including emergence
###2033 now for the first time
###2035 the spectators steps out
###2036 into the stadium
###2038 i was hit
###2040 by a wall of sound
###2052 the super dome
###2054 dominates the romans skyline
