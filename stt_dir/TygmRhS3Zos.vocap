###5 What are they fighting for? If the war sells munitions, submarines
###12 yet you take the lives of American soldiers
###15 and put them up to defend the US.
###18 Are they defending the US
###21 or are they defending the social institutions
###25 the war factories, the war industries?
###28 Do you see what I mean?
###30 Merely marching in front of the Stock Market or Stock Exchange
###35 is only part of this system.
###38 The public pays taxes. They support the police
###42 the Army, the war weapons, everything.
###45 The very rich pay very little taxes
###48 yet they control the police
###50 and the National Guard and the Army.
###55 It's the public that pays the police's salary.
###57 I am told they arrested... - 700
###60 - By now, you say 700. Well, that's interesting
###66 but remember the public pays their salary.
###69 They don't know who they hell they're serving.
###71 When they serve Wall Street that means
###73 the money people really control the country, not the public.
###77 80% of the people say
###80 they are not satisfied with the government's decisions.
###84 If you walk in front of the Stock Exchange, and you say
###90 that these people are corrupt, the whole system is corrupt!
###93 You have to point out these things.
###95 They want to cut Medicare for the poor.
###99 "What do you suggest as an alternative? Let them die?" Bring that up!
###104 "What do you suggest?"
###106 The guy that says "We don't want to give people free medical care."
###110 "What do you want them to do? Die? Yes or No?"
###114 They can't answer that
###117 so pin them down when they say
###122 "We love this country. Our boys are out there fighting
###125 giving up their lives for the country."
###127 "Don't you think we ought to take the profit out of war also
###131 just like the guys don't make money fighting over there?"
###134 They get minimum wage fighting.
###138 When you figure out the cost of war
###142 all the aircraft carriers, all the airplanes, all the cities destroyed
###147 and all the nations wiped out
###149 it's cheaper to take that money
###151 and build new cities all over the world, helping people
###155 to understand the benefits of technology and knowledge.
###159 The whole country is involved in exploitation.
###163 If you are a dentist, you make money on me if I need a root canal.
###167 If you dent your automobile, somebody makes money
###170 straightening out the fenders. Everything is profitable
###174 and we want that changed.
###176 We want the world to concern itself with people
###180 and taking care of the environment. It's the greatest gift we have:
###184 the trees, top soil, oceans
###187 where ships, luxury liners, empty their bilge into the ocean.
###192 That means the oil and all the stuff; they pump it into the ocean.
###197 The oceans are the toilets of the world.
###200 All big hotels pump their fecal matter out into the oceans.
###205 So what do you expect from that?
###207 Do you expect the dolphins to live on [with] healthy lives?
###210 They can't.
###212 If you use genetic manipulation without a long-term study
###217 of the effects of it, you are going to hurt people.
###220 It's the system, not Wall Street. The system produces all that.
###225 Therefore, we offer an alternative system and this is what it is:
###230 to declare the Earth the common heritage of all the world's people.
###234 For those of you that are religious
###237 God didn't make the Earth for the Greeks or the Polocks
###240 of the Jews or the French.
###242 He made it for all the people of the world.
###245 Use religion, use it that way.
###248 You can find that in the Bible "Love your enemy" it says.
###252 It says "Thou shall not kill" in all Bibles
###255 and yet people don't seem to follow that
###258 so apparently they don't understand what they are reading.
###262 They believe in honesty and good and fair-play.
###266 Where did we get this land? We stole it from the Indians.
###269 Women who disagreed were burned as witches in Salem, Massachusetts.
###274 The Ku Klux Klan in America had 3 million members.
###278 If you don't bring that up, that's a problem.
###281 The problem is that freedom
###284 and individual opinions can become dangerous.
###288 I asked many people years ago whether they thought
###292 man will ever get to the Moon. They said "not in a thousand years."
###296 I said "Do you know anything about rockets?" No.
###298 "Do you know anything about space travel?" No.
###300 Well how do you formulate that?
###304 How come we give everybody a right to their own opinion?
###306 Why don't you give them access to information?
###310 Essentially, you have to educate people
###314 teach them about the system, how it works, where it's offensive.
###318 If a man commits a crime
###321 say he steals a watch worth $200
###324 it's his third offense, he goes to jail for 7 years.
###328 It's cheaper to give him a watch than feed him for 7 years
###333 and take care of his medical problems
###335 and hotel, his food.
###338 Putting a man in jail is cruel beyond description.
###342 It's confining a human, taking away his life
###346 putting him there for 10 years, some 20 years, some life in prison.
###351 The judge has no idea what he's doing.
###354 He doesn't know the condition that shaped that value system.
###358 If he knew where that man came from
###361 if he knew the conditioning of that man, he'd say
###364 "It's not his fault. He was brought up to hate
###368 and kill and murder."
###371 It seems that all people that kill and murder
###374 are really enacting the way movies (all our cowboy pictures)
###379 [They] never sit down to discuss anything. They shoot people.
###382 [They] have their two guns. They shoot people.
###385 The Indians were fighting for their land; we stole it from them
###389 but we shoot Indians, and we show the guys in the covered wagons ...
###394 What the hell, are you taking their land away from [them]?
###397 Why don't you ask them whether we can settle down here? They said "No."
###403 We didn't ask them. We took it
###405 and we drove the Indians into the desert region.
###408 They're still looking for justice.
###410 The Indians aren't going to get justice because they have no power.
###415 If they get an Indian in the Congress
###418 if he doesn't conform to the views of the Congressmen
###422 they'll move him out. Do you understand?
###426 Now, as long as sports exist: racing cars
###430 football, baseball, they act as detractors.
###433 They detract people from the real issues.
###437 They don't even know what the real issues are.
###439 The real issues are to take care of this God-given Earth
###443 if you're talking to them, to take care of nature.
###447 God put the trees here to give us oxygen.
###449 We give out carbon dioxide; the trees use that.
###453 Use religion, whatever, wherever they're at.
###458 Talk to them. Say it's not going to change anything
###461 if you march in front of Wall Street, but if you talk to other people
###465 and get a sufficient amount of people organized
###469 to demand the Venus Project.
###471 When 80% of the people don't trust their government anymore
###476 (what the Republicans say about the Democrats
###480 or the Democrats say about the Republicans)
###482 they just don't feel comfortable, and they don't know what else to do
###486 so they would like to (like the Arabs) change the culture
###491 but what do you change it to? They don't know.
###494 If they succeed in changing the culture
###497 it'll revert back to the old values
###500 unless you teach them about the new value system.
###505 Then they say "Well, they've tried that for years and it never worked."
###510 Who tried it? When did they try it? Pin them down.
###514 "Well, I don't know..."
###516 Say "I'm not interested in your opinion, I want facts!" OK?
###521 And they'll try to detract you.
###523 They'll say "It will kill incentive. " "Have you ever tried it?"
###527 "No, Russia has." "Well, Russia didn't have the resources we have
###532 and they didn't steal the land; it was their land."
###535 Russia had men pulling boats along the Volga River.
###540 Did you know that? They had no power system.
###542 Life was so miserable for the majority of people
###546 they took to an ideal that
###549 if the people owned the means of production
###552 they wouldn't hurt each other
###554 so they tried this social experiment and they failed
###558 because they didn't know how precisely to carry it out
###562 to attain what they wanted.
###564 If the socialists got into power
###567 they'd be concerned about the working man.
###569 If automation came up they'd say "No, we have to have people working,"
###574 and other nations will pass us by
###576 surpass us, because they put in automation.
###581 When you get new machines that work everything in the factory
###585 (let's say you've got 3,000 people working in it)
###589 [but] now you got 1500, and machines are assembling cars.
###595 You have to point out that if new machines come in
###598 you'll get the workers together and say:
###600 "Instead of working 8 hours, you now work 4 hours a day
###605 and instead of getting a week off every year
###608 you get 2 months off with your family," and they'd get paid.
###612 That's what the machines do, but if machines
###615 cause you to lose your job, you're going to hate machines.
###619 Machines, when used intelligently
###622 if they turn out 50 times more than a man can turn out
###626 industry will use machines. They don't give a shit about people.
###630 They don't care whether they lay off 400 people, 500 or 3000
###635 if they make more money doing it.
###638 The Japanese are presently working on human faces.
###642 They're not quite good enough.
###644 When you get human faces on television to sell toothpaste
###650 it works for about 15 cents an hour.
###653 Eventually, instead of having people selling goods on TV
###659 you'll have a face: sweet old lady, excellent face
###663 but today, their heads turn like this.
###667 They don't turn naturally. When the Japanese finally get there
###672 everybody can be displaced, including doctors, lawyers.
###676 If you don't understand that, the more sophisticated
###680 say "Well, a scientist can't be displaced, he can think."
###684 No, a scientist is given every word in school
###688 that gravity is a force that shows itself
###692 by electrical, magnetic and chemical effect.
###694 Every word that they use is pumped in.
###697 If you made a computer, an architectural computer
###701 you can say to it "I want a home"
###704 and it'll say "What kind of home? " It has to say that
###708 and you'll say "I'm not sure"
###710 because you're not of student of architecture.
###712 Different homes will appear and rotate
###715 and you say finally "No not, that one!"
###719 Then you'd say to the computer
###722 "I'd like to see the floor plan" and it understands language.
###726 If you don't understand that, there are machines that can type the speech
###730 that understand language, so just like the architect
###734 you say ''I'd like to see the floor plan," and the roof lifts off
###738 or a blueprint is presented to you.
###741 You begin to design integrated systems.
###744 Do you know what that means? That they take in the whole factor
###748 and instead of selling an air-conditioner to every home
###752 we pipe air-conditioned air all around
###755 and you absorb what you want. You turn it on and off.
###758 That's much cheaper than selling an air-conditioner
###761 or a lawn mower to 5000 houses.
###764 The lawn mower people would love to do that
###766 to sell a lawn mower to each house.
###769 Instead of that you have 4 or 5 giant lawn mowers
###772 that take care of the whole area. Do you understand that?
###776 They say "Do we have enough resources?"
###778 We don't, using it the way it's used today:
###781 a lawn mower, an air-conditioner hanging out of every window.
###786 That's not a way to do things.
###788 You have a thousand farms growing the same thing.
###792 You have farms, large farms, industrial farms
###796 without genetic engineering, unless it's been tested for many years
###801 to make sure there's no negative effects.
###805 The system I'm talking about doesn't profit anyone to lie.
###811 Everybody has access to books, school, free of charge
###815 and there's no taxation. If you don't like that system
###819 "What are you, an atheist?"
###822 You approach religious people that way
###825 "This is what God wants. It's called the brotherhood of man."
###830 This doesn't differ from any religious teaching.
###833 It really doesn't, so if you're with normal people
###837 if they say "Will you come to the Presbytarian church
###841 and give a presentation? " do it in that guise.
###845 If you go to a bunch of humanists that are atheists
###849 you don't need to use religion.
###852 You can just point out the shortcomings.
###856 I think I told you about the girl that came with me
###859 with a whip and handcuffs and she says
###861 "I'd like to be whipped and handcuffed to the bed."
###864 She was a Catholic and couldn't think of having sex
###868 without force, and it's not her fault.
###872 She always dreamt of guys holding her down and making love to her
###877 and that was legitimate to her.
###879 Whenever she thought of 'gee', having sex, that was sinful.
###884 Is she bad? No. Is she wrong? No.
###888 She was brought up under different circumstances.
###890 It takes a long while to learn that.
###893 It's much easier to get mad at people.
###897 When you get mad at them, you feel relieved.
###900 In the future when you understand that's where they're coming from
###904 you don't get mad.
