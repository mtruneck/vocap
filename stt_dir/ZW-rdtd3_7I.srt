1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:3,896



2
0:0:3,896 --> 0:0:4,39
BRIAN ANDERSON: Oh,
you know what?


3
0:0:4,39 --> 0:0:7,15
I almost forgot to get you a
water, and I was in line, so I


4
0:0:7,15 --> 0:0:8,7
got you Gatorade.


5
0:0:8,7 --> 0:0:11,856
And there's M&Ms if you guys
want some M&Ms or gum.


6
0:0:11,856 --> 0:0:14,8
JERRY HSU: You could do a trick
to land there, maybe.


7
0:0:14,8 --> 0:0:15,5
BRIAN ANDERSON: I bet
you could land


8
0:0:15,5 --> 0:0:18,11
in it anyway, still.


9
0:0:18,11 --> 0:0:19,34
Seems like it.


10
0:0:19,34 --> 0:0:20,63
Maybe it's because I
have soft wheels.


11
0:0:20,63 --> 0:0:23,48
I'm not sure.


12
0:0:23,48 --> 0:0:23,86
JERRY HSU: That'd be
sex with your trick


13
0:0:23,86 --> 0:0:25,5
and land in it anyway.


14
0:0:25,5 --> 0:0:26,87
BRIAN ANDERSON: I know.


15
0:0:26,87 --> 0:0:28,54
JERRY HSU: Because it's
not skate stop.


16
0:0:28,54 --> 0:0:30,65
Does anyone skate
it, you think?


17
0:0:30,65 --> 0:0:30,93
BRIAN ANDERSON: I don't know.


18
0:0:30,93 --> 0:0:32,18
I don't feel like people do.


19
0:0:32,18 --> 0:0:36,164



20
0:0:36,164 --> 0:0:39,8
[GRUNTING]


21
0:0:39,8 --> 0:0:41,3
BRIAN ANDERSON: Shit.


22
0:0:41,3 --> 0:0:44,38
I'd like to roll away.


23
0:0:44,38 --> 0:0:46,78
JERRY HSU: That's my board.


24
0:0:46,78 --> 0:0:48,3
He better not break it.


25
0:0:48,3 --> 0:0:51,8



26
0:0:51,8 --> 0:0:54,49
BRIAN ANDERSON: Oh, that
fucking hurts.


27
0:0:54,49 --> 0:0:55,74
JERRY HSU: Oh well.


28
0:0:55,74 --> 0:0:58,13



29
0:0:58,13 --> 0:0:58,57
BRIAN ANDERSON: That kitty
litter doesn't


30
0:0:58,57 --> 0:1:0,42
let you land in it.


31
0:1:0,42 --> 0:1:3,76



32
0:1:3,76 --> 0:1:5,62
BRAD STABA: We used to skate
that thing every single day.


33
0:1:5,62 --> 0:1:7,73
We would take the BART
from [INAUDIBLE]


34
0:1:7,73 --> 0:1:9,31
straight to [INAUDIBLE].


35
0:1:9,31 --> 0:1:13,33
And we would like buy a boombox
and bring a fucking


36
0:1:13,33 --> 0:1:17,13
whatever mixtape and just push
play and skate that thing like


37
0:1:17,13 --> 0:1:20,6
all day, smoke weed.


38
0:1:20,6 --> 0:1:22,806
We didn't go there with
cameras, you know?


39
0:1:22,806 --> 0:1:23,83
PATRICK O'DELL: You would
just go to session it?


40
0:1:23,83 --> 0:1:27,7
BRAD STABA: We would go there
every single day, seriously.


41
0:1:27,7 --> 0:1:30,69
The thing is like he didn't go
into skateboarding like, I'm


42
0:1:30,69 --> 0:1:31,61
going to be a pro.


43
0:1:31,61 --> 0:1:32,46
I'm going to get sponsored.


44
0:1:32,46 --> 0:1:34,477
I'm going to make this tape,
and I'm going to send it to


45
0:1:34,477 --> 0:1:36,44
this guy and they're going
to give me free shit.


46
0:1:36,44 --> 0:1:37,68
It just happened, you know?


47
0:1:37,68 --> 0:1:40,27
And if it didn't happen, he
would be doing like--


48
0:1:40,27 --> 0:1:41,52
he'd be work for the city.


49
0:1:41,52 --> 0:1:42,35
He'd be work for the park.


50
0:1:42,35 --> 0:1:44,56
He'd be doing a normal job.


51
0:1:44,56 --> 0:1:47,51
Just living, you know?


52
0:1:47,51 --> 0:1:49,8
Now he's one of the best
skateboarders ever.


53
0:1:49,8 --> 0:1:51,82



54
0:1:51,82 --> 0:1:53,78
[GRUNTING]


55
0:1:53,78 --> 0:1:55,22
BRIAN ANDERSON: That's a make.


56
0:1:55,22 --> 0:1:56,47
I don't care.


57
0:1:56,47 --> 0:1:58,422



58
0:1:58,422 --> 0:1:59,8
I think that's a make.


59
0:1:59,8 --> 0:2:1,546
PATRICK O'DELL: We'll
run the photo.


60
0:2:1,546 --> 0:2:2,69
Did you get the photo?


61
0:2:2,69 --> 0:2:4,94
JERRY HSU: Yeah.


62
0:2:4,94 --> 0:2:6,52
It's already--


63
0:2:6,52 --> 0:2:9,864
I'm sending it out virally.


64
0:2:9,864 --> 0:2:11,114
BRIAN ANDERSON: Those rocks.


65
0:2:11,114 --> 0:2:13,425



66
0:2:13,425 --> 0:2:14,675
Fuck.


67
0:2:14,675 --> 0:2:17,23



68
0:2:17,23 --> 0:2:17,6
PATRICK O'DELL: What's up?


69
0:2:17,6 --> 0:2:19,17
Welcome back to the show.


70
0:2:19,17 --> 0:2:21,17
This week's about
Brian Anderson.


71
0:2:21,17 --> 0:2:23,44
Brian is probably a little bit
different than some pro


72
0:2:23,44 --> 0:2:27,59
skaters in that he's worked in
his life full-time jobs as


73
0:2:27,59 --> 0:2:29,76
like a cook and all these
different things.


74
0:2:29,76 --> 0:2:31,46
So I think he's one of those
skaters that really


75
0:2:31,46 --> 0:2:34,63
appreciates probably being pro,
because he knows what he


76
0:2:34,63 --> 0:2:39,82
has to go back to if
he doesn't skate.


77
0:2:39,82 --> 0:2:42,8
The first video I remember him
in was the "Welcome to Hell"


78
0:2:42,8 --> 0:2:43,95
Toy Machine video.


79
0:2:43,95 --> 0:2:45,37
He had like shaved head.


80
0:2:45,37 --> 0:2:50,11
This big, beastly guy who's
got a lot of pop.


81
0:2:50,11 --> 0:2:51,42
He's really gnarly.


82
0:2:51,42 --> 0:2:55,69
My favorite trick Brian Anderson
does is 360 flips.


83
0:2:55,69 --> 0:2:59,64
I wanted to do this episode to
kind of get an insight into


84
0:2:59,64 --> 0:3:1,45
who he is as a person.


85
0:3:1,45 --> 0:3:3,352
So after the Beauty and the
Beast tour, I went up to San


86
0:3:3,352 --> 0:3:7,17
Francisco to meet up with him
and see what his life's like.


87
0:3:7,17 --> 0:3:9,28
And I don't know, I just wanted
to get in his head.


88
0:3:9,28 --> 0:3:12,2
He seems like a really
intriguing


89
0:3:12,2 --> 0:3:13,27
subject for the show.


90
0:3:13,27 --> 0:3:16,65
And so this is it, the Brian
Anderson episode.


91
0:3:16,65 --> 0:3:17,9
Hope you like it.


92
0:3:17,9 --> 0:3:23,342



93
0:3:23,342 --> 0:3:25,31
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK, what
can I get for you?


94
0:3:25,31 --> 0:3:26,88
DONNY BARLEY: Yeah,
I want to get the


95
0:3:26,88 --> 0:3:28,24
western omelette, please.


96
0:3:28,24 --> 0:3:30,18
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK, white,
wheat, or rye?


97
0:3:30,18 --> 0:3:32,822
DONNY BARLEY: Wheat, please.


98
0:3:32,822 --> 0:3:34,301
Does that come with
home fries?


99
0:3:34,301 --> 0:3:35,29
FEMALE SPEAKER: It does.


100
0:3:35,29 --> 0:3:37,7
DONNY BARLEY: Can I add
bacon to the omelette?


101
0:3:37,7 --> 0:3:37,75
FEMALE SPEAKER: Inside it?


102
0:3:37,75 --> 0:3:38,2
DONNY BARLEY: Yeah.


103
0:3:38,2 --> 0:3:38,675
FEMALE SPEAKER: Sure.


104
0:3:38,675 --> 0:3:39,325
DONNY BARLEY: Thank you.


105
0:3:39,325 --> 0:3:41,52
FEMALE SPEAKER: You're
welcome.


106
0:3:41,52 --> 0:3:43,55
PATRICK O'DELL: Do you come
back to Carlton a lot?


107
0:3:43,55 --> 0:3:45,6
DONNY BARLEY: Yeah,
I come back like


108
0:3:45,6 --> 0:3:46,99
almost every weekend.


109
0:3:46,99 --> 0:3:47,5
It's funny.


110
0:3:47,5 --> 0:3:50,31
This place is all remodeled.


111
0:3:50,31 --> 0:3:52,82
It looks good, but it's
not the same.


112
0:3:52,82 --> 0:3:57,74
Me and Brian used to come here
all the time late night.


113
0:3:57,74 --> 0:4:1,425
Just get coffees sometimes, and
then get fired up and go


114
0:4:1,425 --> 0:4:3,4
on late-night missions
and stuff.


115
0:4:3,4 --> 0:4:6,38
Skating, or coming back from
like a punk rock show.


116
0:4:6,38 --> 0:4:8,514
This is where all the freaks
would hang out late night, so


117
0:4:8,514 --> 0:4:11,79
it was fun.


118
0:4:11,79 --> 0:4:12,56
And then, Brian--


119
0:4:12,56 --> 0:4:17,399
I think he might have been like
11 or 12, and I remember


120
0:4:17,399 --> 0:4:20,32
one day we were skating my
friend Jason's halfpipe.


121
0:4:20,32 --> 0:4:23,51
And these two kids just kind of
walked up the driveway with


122
0:4:23,51 --> 0:4:25,61
their knee pads around
their ankles.


123
0:4:25,61 --> 0:4:28,38
And it was Brian and
his friend Joe.


124
0:4:28,38 --> 0:4:31,87
Brian just jumped right on the
ramp and started doing


125
0:4:31,87 --> 0:4:32,66
everything.


126
0:4:32,66 --> 0:4:35,6
Like, we were pretty amazed.


127
0:4:35,6 --> 0:4:38,43
BRIAN ANDERSON: I probably met
Donny when I was in like sixth


128
0:4:38,43 --> 0:4:40,48
grade or seventh grade or
something like that.


129
0:4:40,48 --> 0:4:42,3
I was on Donny and
Jason's team--


130
0:4:42,3 --> 0:4:43,96
Team 911.


131
0:4:43,96 --> 0:4:46,1
And they made me do all these
different slappies in


132
0:4:46,1 --> 0:4:47,7
order to get on.


133
0:4:47,7 --> 0:4:49,39
They're like, all right, you've
got to do backside to


134
0:4:49,39 --> 0:4:52,66
fakie or whatever and
an Ollie Smith.


135
0:4:52,66 --> 0:4:55,11
And I did all these things,
and they let me


136
0:4:55,11 --> 0:4:57,17
ride for Team 911.


137
0:4:57,17 --> 0:5:0,13
You get the little sticker
that's the 911 emergency call


138
0:5:0,13 --> 0:5:1,9
that parents put on
their home phone.


139
0:5:1,9 --> 0:5:5,1
And you put it right underneath
your front truck.


140
0:5:5,1 --> 0:5:7,36
So I was psyched, dude.


141
0:5:7,36 --> 0:5:9,16
DONNY BARLEY: So there's a
monument right here on the


142
0:5:9,16 --> 0:5:10,61
right hand side.


143
0:5:10,61 --> 0:5:12,81
We used to skate it
all the time.


144
0:5:12,81 --> 0:5:15,91
And it's like a Vietnam
memorial or something.


145
0:5:15,91 --> 0:5:18,29
See those little slants
right there?


146
0:5:18,29 --> 0:5:20,18
We used to skate those
all the time.


147
0:5:20,18 --> 0:5:23,47
The veterans would come by and
be like, ready to murder us


148
0:5:23,47 --> 0:5:28,32
for skating a monument that
represented these lives that


149
0:5:28,32 --> 0:5:31,59
have been lost fighting
this war.


150
0:5:31,59 --> 0:5:34,416
I guess it is pretty
disrespectful, but when you're


151
0:5:34,416 --> 0:5:38,57
young, you don't
comprehend it.


152
0:5:38,57 --> 0:5:42,7
Brian's house is over here.


153
0:5:42,7 --> 0:5:43,26
This is it, yeah.


154
0:5:43,26 --> 0:5:45,65
That's the house right
there, the gray one.


155
0:5:45,65 --> 0:5:47,88
Brian's room at one point
was in the three


156
0:5:47,88 --> 0:5:49,1
windows on the top.


157
0:5:49,1 --> 0:5:52,54
I remember like ollieing down
the stairs all the time when


158
0:5:52,54 --> 0:5:55,73
I'd come hang with Brian.


159
0:5:55,73 --> 0:5:57,87
So this little side street--


160
0:5:57,87 --> 0:6:0,22
we had like all these little
ramps and boxes and little


161
0:6:0,22 --> 0:6:2,18
rails and stuff.


162
0:6:2,18 --> 0:6:4,76
And Brian would just to keep
them underneath this weeping


163
0:6:4,76 --> 0:6:8,18
willow tree, and we'd
just drag them out.


164
0:6:8,18 --> 0:6:11,17
But Brian's parents were
like super, super


165
0:6:11,17 --> 0:6:13,47
mellow and super nice.


166
0:6:13,47 --> 0:6:16,7
I think Brian's parents were
like maybe somewhat strict


167
0:6:16,7 --> 0:6:20,36
with his older siblings, but
by the time Brain was a


168
0:6:20,36 --> 0:6:25,76
teenager, they were
probably like, eh.


169
0:6:25,76 --> 0:6:27,35
BRIAN ANDERSON: The
whole story is--


170
0:6:27,35 --> 0:6:32,22
I think my art teacher in high
school was telling me that if


171
0:6:32,22 --> 0:6:36,345
you you do a portrait, you can
check it in the mirror.


172
0:6:36,345 --> 0:6:40,5
And if it still looks
proportionate, then you did


173
0:6:40,5 --> 0:6:41,9
all right or whatever.


174
0:6:41,9 --> 0:6:42,81
It'll help your art.


175
0:6:42,81 --> 0:6:46,69
And then so I realized that's
a way to watch my favorite--


176
0:6:46,69 --> 0:6:49,58
because I'm regular footed, so
I could watch all my favorite


177
0:6:49,58 --> 0:6:52,12
goofy footers skate
regular footed.


178
0:6:52,12 --> 0:6:58,66
So you could put your favorite
skater on TV.


179
0:6:58,66 --> 0:7:1,19
And then you chill out here with
the mirror, and you can


180
0:7:1,19 --> 0:7:4,29
like see your favorite skater
skate switch, on


181
0:7:4,29 --> 0:7:4,74
the opposite foot.


182
0:7:4,74 --> 0:7:6,18
So that's pretty cool.


183
0:7:6,18 --> 0:7:10,7
So this is the only ghetto-ass
mirror I have.


184
0:7:10,7 --> 0:7:12,72
Look at it, it's regular
footage of Keith Heath.


185
0:7:12,72 --> 0:7:13,97
This is so tight.


186
0:7:13,97 --> 0:7:19,56



187
0:7:19,56 --> 0:7:23,33
Whoa, dude, so cool, man.


188
0:7:23,33 --> 0:7:27,37
DONNY BARLEY: And he's just
always had this artistic


189
0:7:27,37 --> 0:7:29,77
approach, as opposed to
athletic approach.


190
0:7:29,77 --> 0:7:34,3
And that's the difference
between certain like amazing,


191
0:7:34,3 --> 0:7:37,41
talented skaters, you know?


192
0:7:37,41 --> 0:7:43,65
I feel like maybe I have an
athletic edge, but Brian--


193
0:7:43,65 --> 0:7:45,62
he's always got his
flow on, man.


194
0:7:45,62 --> 0:7:48,78
Even when he's just like getting
warmed up and stuff.


195
0:7:48,78 --> 0:7:53,63
And when he was a kid, it was
all about like loose shots and


196
0:7:53,63 --> 0:7:56,67
slapping curves and
just cruising.


197
0:7:56,67 --> 0:7:58,36
Just his own world man--


198
0:7:58,36 --> 0:8:0,49
that's the way it's
supposed to be.


199
0:8:0,49 --> 0:8:3,26
It's like, you can watch the
videos and get things out of


200
0:8:3,26 --> 0:8:5,73
the skate videos, and a lot of
the kids kind of mimic the


201
0:8:5,73 --> 0:8:6,57
skate videos.


202
0:8:6,57 --> 0:8:8,46
Brian--


203
0:8:8,46 --> 0:8:11,4
I feel like he was smart enough
to take a little bit


204
0:8:11,4 --> 0:8:14,73
from all the videos that he
liked and incorporate that


205
0:8:14,73 --> 0:8:18,11
into his own little melting
pot or whatever, you know?


206
0:8:18,11 --> 0:8:33,309



207
0:8:33,309 --> 0:8:34,74
CHAD MUSKA: Just
doing it, man.


208
0:8:34,74 --> 0:8:37,2
Like, needed a change in
life so here I am in


209
0:8:37,2 --> 0:8:39,868
New York City, Soho.


210
0:8:39,868 --> 0:8:44,159
Lights, camera, action.


211
0:8:44,159 --> 0:8:45,43
The early '90s--


212
0:8:45,43 --> 0:8:48,9
whenever that was-- or mid '90s,
late '90s, something--


213
0:8:48,9 --> 0:8:51,25
somewhere in the '90s,
it all began.


214
0:8:51,25 --> 0:8:53,64
And I started hanging
around with Jamie


215
0:8:53,64 --> 0:8:56,68
Thomas, got on Toy Machine--


216
0:8:56,68 --> 0:8:58,79
then a little group kind
of started to form.


217
0:8:58,79 --> 0:9:4,39
It was like Satva, me, Jamie,
Panama Dan, and Ed Templeton,


218
0:9:4,39 --> 0:9:6,28
of course, and Donny Barley.


219
0:9:6,28 --> 0:9:8,12
And I think that was kind
of like the main


220
0:9:8,12 --> 0:9:10,32
clique right there.


221
0:9:10,32 --> 0:9:13,42
DONNY BARLEY: All of a sudden,
we're in our early '20s, and


222
0:9:13,42 --> 0:9:16,62
I'm in California, and I'm
getting hooked up, and it's


223
0:9:16,62 --> 0:9:17,46
unbelievable.


224
0:9:17,46 --> 0:9:19,99
And then coming home and
telling Brian about the


225
0:9:19,99 --> 0:9:24,17
success that I found and begging
him to come out West


226
0:9:24,17 --> 0:9:25,17
to give it a shot--


227
0:9:25,17 --> 0:9:29,67
because if anybody could have
made it, Brian could have done


228
0:9:29,67 --> 0:9:32,2
it all day, any day.


229
0:9:32,2 --> 0:9:34,28
CHAD MUSKA: Donny Barley was
like, oh man, you guys gotta


230
0:9:34,28 --> 0:9:35,145
meet my homie Brian.


231
0:9:35,145 --> 0:9:35,765
He's crazy.


232
0:9:35,765 --> 0:9:37,76
He's like this crazy skater.


233
0:9:37,76 --> 0:9:38,74
He's insane.


234
0:9:38,74 --> 0:9:40,92
And we're all like, yeah,
you always hear that.


235
0:9:40,92 --> 0:9:43,14
It's like everybody gots their
homie from back in the day


236
0:9:43,14 --> 0:9:45,38
that's a crazy good
skater, you know.


237
0:9:45,38 --> 0:9:48,95
So he's talking about him for a
while, and then one day, oh,


238
0:9:48,95 --> 0:9:53,16
my friend Brian's in town, BA.


239
0:9:53,16 --> 0:9:55,65
ED TEMPLETON: We were on a
filming trip during the


240
0:9:55,65 --> 0:9:56,49
"Welcome to Hell" days.


241
0:9:56,49 --> 0:10:0,38
I think Donny gets off the phone
with somebody and says,


242
0:10:0,38 --> 0:10:4,98
hey, my friend back from Groton,
Connecticut's in town.


243
0:10:4,98 --> 0:10:7,96
Is it cool if he comes
skate with us today?


244
0:10:7,96 --> 0:10:11,1
DONNY BARLEY: I called him from
Huntington Beach-- like,


245
0:10:11,1 --> 0:10:14,6
me and Ed and Muska and Jamie
are going to come up to Frisco


246
0:10:14,6 --> 0:10:16,37
to film-- and you have to.


247
0:10:16,37 --> 0:10:18,35
You have to get to
San Francisco.


248
0:10:18,35 --> 0:10:19,86
I will pick you up.


249
0:10:19,86 --> 0:10:22,57
I'll pay you back for
your bus ticket--


250
0:10:22,57 --> 0:10:23,7
anything.


251
0:10:23,7 --> 0:10:24,21
I just begged.


252
0:10:24,21 --> 0:10:28,17
And I had already spent like six
hours in the van telling


253
0:10:28,17 --> 0:10:30,56
these guys, when we get to
Frisco, my friend Brian's


254
0:10:30,56 --> 0:10:31,54
going to come us.


255
0:10:31,54 --> 0:10:33,23
You guys are going to
trip your balls off.


256
0:10:33,23 --> 0:10:35,74
This kid's the best
skater ever, ever.


257
0:10:35,74 --> 0:10:38,27
It's so corny thinking back,
but I think I did say


258
0:10:38,27 --> 0:10:41,91
something like, hey man, if
you really want to make


259
0:10:41,91 --> 0:10:45,3
something now's the day.


260
0:10:45,3 --> 0:10:47,289
I just didn't know if this
opportunity was going to come


261
0:10:47,289 --> 0:10:48,396
around again, you know.


262
0:10:48,396 --> 0:10:50,41
BRIAN ANDERSON: I wasn't
concerned of fanning out on


263
0:10:50,41 --> 0:10:50,98
them or nothing.


264
0:10:50,98 --> 0:10:52,69
I didn't even know who
Jamie Thomas was.


265
0:10:52,69 --> 0:10:55,81
Ed Templeton was like my
idol when I was little.


266
0:10:55,81 --> 0:11:0,51
So Jamie Thomas was news
to me, and Chad Muska--


267
0:11:0,51 --> 0:11:1,85
I didn't know who
he was, either.


268
0:11:1,85 --> 0:11:4,27
And he wasn't "The Muska" yet.


269
0:11:4,27 --> 0:11:5,87
CHAD MUSKA: We went skating,
and all of a sudden, I was


270
0:11:5,87 --> 0:11:8,31
like, damn, this dude's doing
some crazy tricks.


271
0:11:8,31 --> 0:11:10,15
He's got like ill [INAUDIBLE].


272
0:11:10,15 --> 0:11:11,48
And he's messing around.


273
0:11:11,48 --> 0:11:14,38
He's just like rolling and just
does like a 540 flip on


274
0:11:14,38 --> 0:11:15,84
flat ground or something
like out of nowhere.


275
0:11:15,84 --> 0:11:18,96
And you're just like,
what the hell.


276
0:11:18,96 --> 0:11:21,27
And then all of a sudden, he
just started going around us


277
0:11:21,27 --> 0:11:24,11
in and just started busting and
busting and busting and


278
0:11:24,11 --> 0:11:27,13
like crazy, crazy ass shit that
like none of the pros


279
0:11:27,13 --> 0:11:27,56
were doing.


280
0:11:27,56 --> 0:11:29,49
And we're like this dude's
not even sponsored.


281
0:11:29,49 --> 0:11:32,97
He hadn't even skated in two
years, and all of a sudden, I


282
0:11:32,97 --> 0:11:34,66
was just so psyched on him.


283
0:11:34,66 --> 0:11:36,71
I remember being like,
this guy's insane.


284
0:11:36,71 --> 0:11:40,6
He can do any trick he wants
to do, anything.


285
0:11:40,6 --> 0:11:41,706
ED TEMPLETON: He starts
killing it.


286
0:11:41,706 --> 0:11:42,27
Real sketchy, though.


287
0:11:42,27 --> 0:11:45,41
You could tell he doesn't
skate all the time.


288
0:11:45,41 --> 0:11:48,275
But he ollied over the
rail to boardslide--


289
0:11:48,275 --> 0:11:51,7
and it's in the video-- he
boardslides down the long rail


290
0:11:51,7 --> 0:11:52,73
and comes off.


291
0:11:52,73 --> 0:11:54,55
And he's just flapping
all over the place


292
0:11:54,55 --> 0:11:55,8
when he does it.


293
0:11:55,8 --> 0:11:58,35
And I think at that moment, we
were just all like-- here's


294
0:11:58,35 --> 0:11:59,98
the whole Toy Machine team.


295
0:11:59,98 --> 0:12:2,8
We're supposed to be these dudes
who slaughter stuff.


296
0:12:2,8 --> 0:12:4,72
Everyone gets to these rails,
and no one's feeling anything,


297
0:12:4,72 --> 0:12:5,5
and we're all being wusses.


298
0:12:5,5 --> 0:12:8,28
And then this dude from
Connecticut just


299
0:12:8,28 --> 0:12:9,74
manhandles this rail.


300
0:12:9,74 --> 0:12:12,165
DONNY BARLEY: I think he did it
first try, or he slid half


301
0:12:12,165 --> 0:12:14,1
of it first try.


302
0:12:14,1 --> 0:12:16,365
And they were just like,
what the fuck.


303
0:12:16,365 --> 0:12:19,58
Chad's like, Danny,
go get the camera!


304
0:12:19,58 --> 0:12:22,95
And Jamie's running to the van
and going up to Brian like,


305
0:12:22,95 --> 0:12:24,73
hey Brian, can you
do this again?


306
0:12:24,73 --> 0:12:25,7
BRIAN ANDERSON: I didn't
know that it was


307
0:12:25,7 --> 0:12:29,35
OK to refilm something.


308
0:12:29,35 --> 0:12:33,3
Like, I would land it and be
like, ah, I landed it.


309
0:12:33,3 --> 0:12:35,5
I didn't know that it probably
looked kind of gross and I


310
0:12:35,5 --> 0:12:36,75
should do a smoother one.


311
0:12:36,75 --> 0:12:48,24



312
0:12:48,24 --> 0:12:50,64
Muska got hurt that day we
skated in San Francisco.


313
0:12:50,64 --> 0:12:52,3
He tried to tailslide the
[INAUDIBLE] ledge.


314
0:12:52,3 --> 0:12:54,9



315
0:12:54,9 --> 0:12:56,9
I don't know if it ever
came out, but he


316
0:12:56,9 --> 0:12:59,246
slammed really hard.


317
0:12:59,246 --> 0:13:0,96
He was in the van, I remember,
after that.


318
0:13:0,96 --> 0:13:4,55
He was like, I just want to
fucking smoke this bowl.


319
0:13:4,55 --> 0:13:8,2
And I was like, whoa,
this dude's bumming.


320
0:13:8,2 --> 0:13:10,26
I passed the lighter through
the window to


321
0:13:10,26 --> 0:13:12,5
Chad, like, here dude.


322
0:13:12,5 --> 0:13:13,86
I know you need to get
stoned right now.


323
0:13:13,86 --> 0:13:14,62
You're so hurt.


324
0:13:14,62 --> 0:13:17,34
DONNY BARLEY: Right when Chad
and Brian connected, I knew


325
0:13:17,34 --> 0:13:20,25
that that was half the battle.


326
0:13:20,25 --> 0:13:24,35
And then it was just a matter of
convincing Ed and Jamie to


327
0:13:24,35 --> 0:13:26,48
put them on.


328
0:13:26,48 --> 0:13:27,74
CHAD MUSKA: It took everybody
else a minute.


329
0:13:27,74 --> 0:13:29,73
Everybody was kind of like, I
don't know, I don't know.


330
0:13:29,73 --> 0:13:31,5
And me and Donny were
like, yeah.


331
0:13:31,5 --> 0:13:33,1
And I remember Ed was like, oh
my god, this guy's dope.


332
0:13:33,1 --> 0:13:35,94
I think Ed liked him because he
was tall and lanky, kind of


333
0:13:35,94 --> 0:13:36,76
like Ed was.


334
0:13:36,76 --> 0:13:40,3
So Ed was like, oh,
I like this guy.


335
0:13:40,3 --> 0:13:41,33
ED TEMPLETON: I think
all of us--


336
0:13:41,33 --> 0:13:44,345
especially me and Muska, because
Muska's there-- and


337
0:13:44,345 --> 0:13:46,69
we're all like, holy crap,
this guy's amazing.


338
0:13:46,69 --> 0:13:47,5
Let's put him on the team.


339
0:13:47,5 --> 0:13:49,93
And Jamie was just
like, no way.


340
0:13:49,93 --> 0:13:50,53
What're you guys thinking?


341
0:13:50,53 --> 0:13:53,66
I don't know what Jamie will say
to this, but at the time,


342
0:13:53,66 --> 0:13:54,67
he was not for it.


343
0:13:54,67 --> 0:13:57,57
Obviously, we're not just going
to throw a guy on right


344
0:13:57,57 --> 0:13:58,35
there on the spot.


345
0:13:58,35 --> 0:14:2,41
So we told him, hey, we're
really interested


346
0:14:2,41 --> 0:14:3,98
in you a real way.


347
0:14:3,98 --> 0:14:4,97
Do you have any footage?


348
0:14:4,97 --> 0:14:6,2
BRIAN ANDERSON: Those
guys said, make me


349
0:14:6,2 --> 0:14:6,9
a sponsor me tape.


350
0:14:6,9 --> 0:14:9,45
So I skated around in Sac
and got some cool


351
0:14:9,45 --> 0:14:11,1
stuff with Mike Rafter.


352
0:14:11,1 --> 0:14:14,61
And then we went to SF one day,
I was like, I want to


353
0:14:14,61 --> 0:14:15,97
front side blunt side
Hubba Hideout.


354
0:14:15,97 --> 0:14:18,6
I think I can do it.


355
0:14:18,6 --> 0:14:19,86
And I did it.


356
0:14:19,86 --> 0:14:22,21
So we put that in
sponsor me tape.


357
0:14:22,21 --> 0:14:22,94
I shaved--


358
0:14:22,94 --> 0:14:24,26
bicced-- my head.


359
0:14:24,26 --> 0:14:27,61
So Jamie and Ed, once they saw
the front side blunt side with


360
0:14:27,61 --> 0:14:29,73
the bicced head, they were like,
oh, this dude looks like


361
0:14:29,73 --> 0:14:32,7
he just got out of
fucking jail.


362
0:14:32,7 --> 0:14:33,49
Cool.


363
0:14:33,49 --> 0:14:35,21
ED TEMPLETON: And we were just
blown away that we were


364
0:14:35,21 --> 0:14:37,9
getting a sponsor me
video from a dude--


365
0:14:37,9 --> 0:14:38,44
Donny's bro from Connecticut--


366
0:14:38,44 --> 0:14:41,14
and he just bicced his head
and front-blunts Hubba


367
0:14:41,14 --> 0:14:43,92
Hideout, which was just
completely ludicrous.


368
0:14:43,92 --> 0:14:46,82
And I mean it was like,
chill-giving, almost.


369
0:14:46,82 --> 0:14:48,34
The team watch and they're
like, holy fuck.


370
0:14:48,34 --> 0:14:49,89
And that just submitted
him on.


371
0:14:49,89 --> 0:14:53,15
I think Jamie was instantly,
definitely on.


372
0:14:53,15 --> 0:14:54,66
Chad and I were already
like, we love the guy.


373
0:14:54,66 --> 0:14:56,87
And I think everybody else on
the team was just like, yeah,


374
0:14:56,87 --> 0:14:58,21
no-brainer.


375
0:14:58,21 --> 0:15:1,47
Front-blunt Hubba Hideout
like a man.


376
0:15:1,47 --> 0:15:3,23
Yeah, I put him on.


377
0:15:3,23 --> 0:15:7,4
That was definitely the one
push-over thing that he did,


378
0:15:7,4 --> 0:15:10,56
and he just looks so
bad-ass doing it.


379
0:15:10,56 --> 0:15:11,72
MALE SPEAKER 1: In the Toy
Machine video when he shrinks


380
0:15:11,72 --> 0:15:12,93
hubba with that look.


381
0:15:12,93 --> 0:15:15,7
I'm like, who the hell
is this dude?


382
0:15:15,7 --> 0:15:18,1
Like 6 foot fucking 9.


383
0:15:18,1 --> 0:15:19,81
MALE SPEAKER 2: He took hubba
down a foot or two with those


384
0:15:19,81 --> 0:15:22,19
fucking eyes.


385
0:15:22,19 --> 0:15:23,575
PATRICK O'DELL: He had
a shaved head.


386
0:15:23,575 --> 0:15:24,91
MALE SPEAKER 2: Yeah, and
just looking so beast


387
0:15:24,91 --> 0:15:25,92
rolling up to it.


388
0:15:25,92 --> 0:15:29,59
MALE SPEAKER 1: Comes around and
he just stares right at it


389
0:15:29,59 --> 0:15:32,26
and he's just like oh, it got
scared and was all [INAUDIBLE]


390
0:15:32,26 --> 0:15:33,935
and shrank a little.


391
0:15:33,935 --> 0:15:35,185
Brother's going to fuck me up.


392
0:15:35,185 --> 0:15:37,58



393
0:15:37,58 --> 0:15:39,292
DONNY BARLEY: Brian Anderson--


394
0:15:39,292 --> 0:15:40,56
he's from Connecticut.


395
0:15:40,56 --> 0:15:42,762
We grew up skateboarding
together.


396
0:15:42,762 --> 0:15:44,97
He's the best.


397
0:15:44,97 --> 0:15:46,82
CHAD MUSKA: All of a sudden, he
had a part in a video and


398
0:15:46,82 --> 0:15:50,99
he went literally overnight
from being like nobody, to


399
0:15:50,99 --> 0:15:55,32
giving up skateboarding, to
coming in on a random visit--


400
0:15:55,32 --> 0:15:58,81
he became sponsored and started
off to his career


401
0:15:58,81 --> 0:16:1,18
pretty much like that,
unexpectedly.


402
0:16:1,18 --> 0:16:6,94
So I think that was really cool
to see that all go down.


403
0:16:6,94 --> 0:16:9,28
BRIAN ANDERSON: Jamie Thomas and
Templeton called me, and


404
0:16:9,28 --> 0:16:10,9
they're like, all right
well, we're going to


405
0:16:10,9 --> 0:16:12,9
make this video soon.


406
0:16:12,9 --> 0:16:14,35
We want you to fly to San
Diego and work on it.


407
0:16:14,35 --> 0:16:15,94
So I said OK, great.


408
0:16:15,94 --> 0:16:17,195
I think that was the
first time I


409
0:16:17,195 --> 0:16:18,79
ever flew on an airplane.


410
0:16:18,79 --> 0:16:20,29
And I was taking off
in [INAUDIBLE]


411
0:16:20,29 --> 0:16:21,66
like, whoa my head.


412
0:16:21,66 --> 0:16:23,5
This feels crazy.


413
0:16:23,5 --> 0:16:25,5
And I landed in San Diego.


414
0:16:25,5 --> 0:16:28,69
Jamie picked me up in his Honda
Passport, and he said,


415
0:16:28,69 --> 0:16:30,38
this is Elissa Steamer.


416
0:16:30,38 --> 0:16:33,82
ELISSA STEAMER: I think I
remember that day, too.


417
0:16:33,82 --> 0:16:35,662
BRIAN ANDERSON: I didn't know
that you were going to be on


418
0:16:35,662 --> 0:16:37,52
Toy Machine, and I didn't know
much about it either.


419
0:16:37,52 --> 0:16:39,97
And I didn't know anything
about you.


420
0:16:39,97 --> 0:16:41,82
ELISSA STEAMER: I think I had
seen your footage it in the


421
0:16:41,82 --> 0:16:42,68
computer, maybe.


422
0:16:42,68 --> 0:16:43,77
BRIAN ANDERSON: OK.


423
0:16:43,77 --> 0:16:46,96
And then we just stayed at
Jamie's house in Pacific Beach


424
0:16:46,96 --> 0:16:49,41
and went out filming.


425
0:16:49,41 --> 0:16:51,56
ELISSA STEAMER: I have this
bad reaction when somebody


426
0:16:51,56 --> 0:16:53,82
wins a trick, I'll
scream, right.


427
0:16:53,82 --> 0:16:55,23
And I'll always happen
to be around the


428
0:16:55,23 --> 0:16:56,86
camera for some reason.


429
0:16:56,86 --> 0:16:58,7
And I remember that kinker--


430
0:16:58,7 --> 0:17:0,69
BRIAN ANDERSON: It was my last
trick and you went, whoa.


431
0:17:0,69 --> 0:17:2,18
ELISSA STEAMER: Yeah,
yeah, yeah.


432
0:17:2,18 --> 0:17:2,31
PATRICK O'DELL: You
know, it's funny--


433
0:17:2,31 --> 0:17:4,796
I always thought that
was a kid yelling.


434
0:17:4,796 --> 0:17:5,282
ELISSA STEAMER: That was me.


435
0:17:5,282 --> 0:17:6,254
I was a little kid.


436
0:17:6,254 --> 0:17:8,2
Not really.


437
0:17:8,2 --> 0:17:11,5
20-year-old.


438
0:17:11,5 --> 0:17:12,599
BRIAN ANDERSON: It was awesome
because I was psyched to just


439
0:17:12,599 --> 0:17:14,109
be skating with people
that ripped


440
0:17:14,109 --> 0:17:16,48
constantly, all day long.


441
0:17:16,48 --> 0:17:17,76
CHAD MUSKA: I remember the
process for filming for


442
0:17:17,76 --> 0:17:20,24
"Welcome To Hell." It was
a crazy process, man.


443
0:17:20,24 --> 0:17:22,319
So every once in a while, I got
to stay on Jamie's couch.


444
0:17:22,319 --> 0:17:24,22
And that was a privilege
and a curse at the


445
0:17:24,22 --> 0:17:25,15
same time, I guess.


446
0:17:25,15 --> 0:17:29,12
Because I'd wake up at like 6:00
in the morning to Jamie


447
0:17:29,12 --> 0:17:33,34
blasting Slayer and getting a
pan and a tin and banging them


448
0:17:33,34 --> 0:17:37,3
to my head and wake up with this
dick on my shoulder or


449
0:17:37,3 --> 0:17:38,77
something like that,
crazy-like.


450
0:17:38,77 --> 0:17:39,98
Jamie was crazy, man.


451
0:17:39,98 --> 0:17:42,12
I woke up to a lot of crazy
shit at Jamie's house.


452
0:17:42,12 --> 0:17:44,3
Jamie had an agenda
all the time.


453
0:17:44,3 --> 0:17:47,39
He was like, OK, we're going
to wake up today, and I got


454
0:17:47,39 --> 0:17:49,34
this new angle I'm thinking
about filming of you on the


455
0:17:49,34 --> 0:17:51,2
handrail, and you're going
to bust it today.


456
0:17:51,2 --> 0:17:52,69
BRIAN ANDERSON: In my
part there's a line.


457
0:17:52,69 --> 0:17:54,86
Jamie's like, you should
half-cab up this curb, and


458
0:17:54,86 --> 0:17:56,42
then-- but he didn't
command me.


459
0:17:56,42 --> 0:17:58,41
He's like, Brian, maybe
think about--


460
0:17:58,41 --> 0:17:59,34
but it's helpful.


461
0:17:59,34 --> 0:18:1,21
I like that about Jamie.


462
0:18:1,21 --> 0:18:3,22
CHAD MUSKA: Brian started
filming the illest video part


463
0:18:3,22 --> 0:18:5,22
that was competing with
all of our parts.


464
0:18:5,22 --> 0:18:7,46
And we're like, oh shit,
this dude's kiling it.


465
0:18:7,46 --> 0:18:9,24
We have to step up our
game to keep up


466
0:18:9,24 --> 0:18:10,91
with his part, I remember.


467
0:18:10,91 --> 0:18:14,7
ED TEMPLETON: For sure when that
name came on the screen,


468
0:18:14,7 --> 0:18:17,48
the collective skate audience
must have been like, Brian


469
0:18:17,48 --> 0:18:19,32
Anderson, what?


470
0:18:19,32 --> 0:18:24,63
But then he just proceeded to
slaughter everything and skate


471
0:18:24,63 --> 0:18:27,92
super big hubbas and have
this kind of groove.


472
0:18:27,92 --> 0:18:29,13
You can see it in his lines.


473
0:18:29,13 --> 0:18:33,4
He does a trick and does
a couple swerves.


474
0:18:33,4 --> 0:18:35,95
He's just got this jazz to the
way he skated in that video.


475
0:18:35,95 --> 0:18:40,31
And all of us were just
super-psyched on it.


476
0:18:40,31 --> 0:18:42,45
CHAD MUSKA: And it was like the
video's coming out, we've


477
0:18:42,45 --> 0:18:44,5
got to finish it.


478
0:18:44,5 --> 0:18:46,84
And we worked it so hard
in the video--


479
0:18:46,84 --> 0:18:50,242
at the premiere it kind of all
just fell apart that night.


480
0:18:50,242 --> 0:18:53,46
DONNY BARLEY: Sure enough, Jamie
tried his ass off, but


481
0:18:53,46 --> 0:18:55,16
for some reason the
computer crashed.


482
0:18:55,16 --> 0:18:57,24
CHAD MUSKA: And it was, this was
the reason, and that was a


483
0:18:57,24 --> 0:19:1,3
reason, and people were
drinking, and I was drinking,


484
0:19:1,3 --> 0:19:6,0
and the kids were upset.


485
0:19:6,0 --> 0:19:10,1
The kids wanted the videos so
there's a lot of crazy energy


486
0:19:10,1 --> 0:19:13,31
that all came out
in one night.


487
0:19:13,31 --> 0:19:14,35
I quit the team.


488
0:19:14,35 --> 0:19:15,525
They kind of put me back on.


489
0:19:15,525 --> 0:19:16,88
And then I quit again.


490
0:19:16,88 --> 0:19:19,72
And then they kicked me off
and it was like this whole


491
0:19:19,72 --> 0:19:24,65
thing, and it just was time
for me to move on.


492
0:19:24,65 --> 0:19:26,62
DONNY BARLEY: The video
was supposed to be--


493
0:19:26,62 --> 0:19:28,37
Chad, I think, was supposed
to have the last part.


494
0:19:28,37 --> 0:19:32,93
Once Chad was gone, I think we
went back in rearranged it.


495
0:19:32,93 --> 0:19:34,84
And so we hit the road.


496
0:19:34,84 --> 0:19:36,65
And we brought the
video with us.


497
0:19:36,65 --> 0:19:40,155
And every demo we'd show up and
get out of the van and try


498
0:19:40,155 --> 0:19:42,89
to rip as hard as we
could for the kids.


499
0:19:42,89 --> 0:19:45,67
Usually, we'd end up back
in the skate shop.


500
0:19:45,67 --> 0:19:50,6
The kids would watch the video
and it was really, really nice


501
0:19:50,6 --> 0:19:52,21
to see the reception
of the video.


502
0:19:52,21 --> 0:19:53,31
It was so positive.


503
0:19:53,31 --> 0:19:56,48
Kids would watch it and just
walk out of the skate shop


504
0:19:56,48 --> 0:19:57,41
speechless.


505
0:19:57,41 --> 0:19:59,92
BRIAN ANDERSON: I didn't know
how gnarly people were going


506
0:19:59,92 --> 0:20:2,2
to look at "Welcome to Hell."
And at that time in


507
0:20:2,2 --> 0:20:4,3
skateboarding--


508
0:20:4,3 --> 0:20:6,17
obviously after amazing,
amazing Plan B


509
0:20:6,17 --> 0:20:7,69
videos, and all that--


510
0:20:7,69 --> 0:20:11,21
I feel like maybe there wasn't
anything huge besides


511
0:20:11,21 --> 0:20:12,77
"Indecent Exposure"
or something.


512
0:20:12,77 --> 0:20:16,394
So I think Jamie blew lot of
kids' minds with "Welcome to


513
0:20:16,394 --> 0:20:18,2
Hell."


514
0:20:18,2 --> 0:20:19,31
ELISSA STEAMER: I had
no idea what I was


515
0:20:19,31 --> 0:20:20,13
getting myself into.


516
0:20:20,13 --> 0:20:21,24
You know what I mean?


517
0:20:21,24 --> 0:20:23,48
I had no idea it was going to
be so heavy of a video.


518
0:20:23,48 --> 0:20:26,19



519
0:20:26,19 --> 0:20:27,57
Because of the Toy
Machine video--


520
0:20:27,57 --> 0:20:30,17
I had never even seen a Toy
Machine video before.


521
0:20:30,17 --> 0:20:32,46
BRIAN ANDERSON: After that video
came out, because people


522
0:20:32,46 --> 0:20:35,36
didn't know who I was, I went on
this tour and I had an easy


523
0:20:35,36 --> 0:20:36,77
time doing demos.


524
0:20:36,77 --> 0:20:41,3
Because they were watching Jamie
and Ed and Maldonado and


525
0:20:41,3 --> 0:20:45,45
Satva, so I would just kind
of skate around, and that


526
0:20:45,45 --> 0:20:47,29
introduced me to doing demos.


527
0:20:47,29 --> 0:20:48,756
Because otherwise, I probably
would have been


528
0:20:48,756 --> 0:20:50,75
like, uh, this is weird.


529
0:20:50,75 --> 0:20:54,18
ED TEMPLETON: The rad times
about that era for me was just


530
0:20:54,18 --> 0:20:55,63
tour, as a general.


531
0:20:55,63 --> 0:20:57,76
I was just, like some of
the funnest tours ever.


532
0:20:57,76 --> 0:20:59,68
For me, shooting photos I guess
is what I'm saying.


533
0:20:59,68 --> 0:21:3,51
Like I was documenting
this whole like--


534
0:21:3,51 --> 0:21:5,76
just those guys,
just the team.


535
0:21:5,76 --> 0:21:9,86
I guess you can kind of equate
it to some people have this


536
0:21:9,86 --> 0:21:12,77
like, I was the high school
captain of the football team


537
0:21:12,77 --> 0:21:14,24
and the king of the prom,
or something.


538
0:21:14,24 --> 0:21:17,4
And they live their whole life
looking back on those one


539
0:21:17,4 --> 0:21:18,57
achievements in high school.


540
0:21:18,57 --> 0:21:22,32
It's like, for me, that era is
one of those things I look


541
0:21:22,32 --> 0:21:23,66
back on, and just be like,
man, those were


542
0:21:23,66 --> 0:21:24,47
the best times ever.


543
0:21:24,47 --> 0:21:25,86
Those are the times
of our lives.


544
0:21:25,86 --> 0:21:28,68
That was right before the era
where it was real important to


545
0:21:28,68 --> 0:21:29,74
be filming all the time.


546
0:21:29,74 --> 0:21:36,55
So demos and fun were the main
focus, not let's go use every


547
0:21:36,55 --> 0:21:38,95
spare minute at a spot and
trying to get footage.


548
0:21:38,95 --> 0:21:45,6
It was literally like, let's go
buy a raft and go rafting


549
0:21:45,6 --> 0:21:45,81
for the hell of it.


550
0:21:45,81 --> 0:21:50,19
Or eat good food, skate spots
when you feel like it, show up


551
0:21:50,19 --> 0:21:52,4
at the demo and kill it,
that kind of stuff.


552
0:21:52,4 --> 0:21:54,16
BRIAN ANDERSON: Skating
for Ed was great.


553
0:21:54,16 --> 0:21:55,33
Ed had never messed with you.


554
0:21:55,33 --> 0:21:58,31
We could smoke all the weed we
wanted and drink beer, and


555
0:21:58,31 --> 0:21:59,17
that was fine.


556
0:21:59,17 --> 0:22:0,85
because he knew we were
all down to skate.


557
0:22:0,85 --> 0:22:4,14
And we all would wake up and go
do the best demo we could.


558
0:22:4,14 --> 0:22:6,54
ELISSA STEAMER: Like friends
are friends, right?


559
0:22:6,54 --> 0:22:10,45
But it's almost like you form a
different special bond with


560
0:22:10,45 --> 0:22:12,71
like a teammate or somebody
that you travel with


561
0:22:12,71 --> 0:22:14,13
all the time for--


562
0:22:14,13 --> 0:22:14,92
you know?


563
0:22:14,92 --> 0:22:17,18
BRIAN ANDERSON: When we were
partying and stuff, I was kind


564
0:22:17,18 --> 0:22:18,77
of her personal bodyguard.


565
0:22:18,77 --> 0:22:20,5
ELISSA STEAMER: Yeah.


566
0:22:20,5 --> 0:22:23,25
Where were we before we
came here, Donny?


567
0:22:23,25 --> 0:22:25,97
I've still got to make a book
of people's stories of


568
0:22:25,97 --> 0:22:27,34
dragging or something.


569
0:22:27,34 --> 0:22:29,87
But, yeah, he's protected
me a lot.


570
0:22:29,87 --> 0:22:30,74
PATRICK O'DELL: Tell
me about that.


571
0:22:30,74 --> 0:22:32,67
BRIAN ANDERSON: Love
protecting her.


572
0:22:32,67 --> 0:22:36,33
ELISSA STEAMER: Oh, just like
get in between some angry


573
0:22:36,33 --> 0:22:42,475
person and me, or carry me home,
or find me on the side


574
0:22:42,475 --> 0:22:44,3
of the road, or something.


575
0:22:44,3 --> 0:22:45,88
BRIAN ANDERSON: Sometimes
somebody would be saying some


576
0:22:45,88 --> 0:22:46,54
inappropriate things.


577
0:22:46,54 --> 0:22:47,8
ELISSA STEAMER: Inappropriate,
that's the word.


578
0:22:47,8 --> 0:22:49,84
BRIAN ANDERSON: Just
like, come on.


579
0:22:49,84 --> 0:22:52,34
And I'm not a fighter
but I certainly


580
0:22:52,34 --> 0:22:54,97
have a lot of sisters.


581
0:22:54,97 --> 0:22:58,84
I feel this need
to protect her.


582
0:22:58,84 --> 0:23:1,8
ED TEMPLETON: This was just
funny because Elissa had


583
0:23:1,8 --> 0:23:5,79
dranken way too much the night
before and was just completely


584
0:23:5,79 --> 0:23:6,72
fucked in the morning.


585
0:23:6,72 --> 0:23:8,24
She had already barfed
there on the curb,


586
0:23:8,24 --> 0:23:9,84
right where she's sitting.


587
0:23:9,84 --> 0:23:13,24
Mike had some porn mag,
and it was just funny.


588
0:23:13,24 --> 0:23:15,52
I wanted to kind of get a shot
of like the stuff Alissa has


589
0:23:15,52 --> 0:23:18,88
to put up with, driving on tour
with a bunch of guys.


590
0:23:18,88 --> 0:23:23,39
Constant porn mags everywhere,
and girls walking by the van


591
0:23:23,39 --> 0:23:27,5
definitely get commented on
in pretty rude ways, and


592
0:23:27,5 --> 0:23:29,856
obviously Elissa just like
laughs at all that stuff and


593
0:23:29,856 --> 0:23:31,48
thinks it's funny.


594
0:23:31,48 --> 0:23:32,91
ELISSA STEAMER: It really
wasn't difficult.


595
0:23:32,91 --> 0:23:34,67
It was kind of like the
funnest thing ever.


596
0:23:34,67 --> 0:23:39,31
Because, I mean, I had to skate
all the time in order to


597
0:23:39,31 --> 0:23:42,0
get into the position to go on
tour, so therefore all I hung


598
0:23:42,0 --> 0:23:44,29
out with was guys all
day, every day.


599
0:23:44,29 --> 0:23:47,96
So it was just like
the same thing.


600
0:23:47,96 --> 0:23:50,16
It was just like switching from
one pack of wolves to


601
0:23:50,16 --> 0:23:53,13
another pack of wolves.


602
0:23:53,13 --> 0:23:54,38
PATRICK O'DELL: Yeah.


603
0:23:54,38 --> 0:24:5,27



604
0:24:5,27 --> 0:24:6,61
BRAD STABA: Brian's
great, man.


605
0:24:6,61 --> 0:24:7,85
I had to get him to
come out here.


606
0:24:7,85 --> 0:24:10,9
Like, he usually denies me
for most everything.


607
0:24:10,9 --> 0:24:12,419
PATRICK O'DELL: When we were
filming this, he'd be like,


608
0:24:12,419 --> 0:24:13,95
ah, I'm super busy,
but OK, let's just


609
0:24:13,95 --> 0:24:14,69
try to make it work.


610
0:24:14,69 --> 0:24:17,3
Then I'd be like, so what do you
have to do that you're so


611
0:24:17,3 --> 0:24:18,1
busy today?


612
0:24:18,1 --> 0:24:20,7
Oh, I gotta go to the
grocery store.


613
0:24:20,7 --> 0:24:22,99
And it was like really
[INAUDIBLE] stuff.


614
0:24:22,99 --> 0:24:24,59
BRAD STABA: Stuff that he could
just do in two seconds.


615
0:24:24,59 --> 0:24:25,86
And you know he lives
right next to the


616
0:24:25,86 --> 0:24:27,154
grocery store, right?


617
0:24:27,154 --> 0:24:28,85
PATRICK O'DELL: Yeah,
that's what he'd do.


618
0:24:28,85 --> 0:24:32,11
He's right next to
the Safeway.


619
0:24:32,11 --> 0:24:35,28
BRAD STABA: Dude, he could hop
his back fence, and literally


620
0:24:35,28 --> 0:24:36,92
he's in the Safeway.


621
0:24:36,92 --> 0:24:40,6
So he doesn't use the going to
the grocery store one on me


622
0:24:40,6 --> 0:24:41,822
because I'll call him
out in a second.


623
0:24:41,822 --> 0:24:47,11
But yeah, he'll whip out some
fucked up excuses, man.


624
0:24:47,11 --> 0:24:48,36
Pull.


625
0:24:48,36 --> 0:24:50,78



626
0:24:50,78 --> 0:24:55,44
I met Brian in 1997.


627
0:24:55,44 --> 0:24:58,56
And then we went on
this Europe trip.


628
0:24:58,56 --> 0:25:2,7
It was Donny Barley, me, Brian,
and Josh Spiegel.


629
0:25:2,7 --> 0:25:5,61
DONNY BARLEY: Brian and
Brad totally were like


630
0:25:5,61 --> 0:25:7,53
instant best friends.


631
0:25:7,53 --> 0:25:10,8
And I think they've just
been homies ever since.


632
0:25:10,8 --> 0:25:15,58
Just weird personalities
that kind of click


633
0:25:15,58 --> 0:25:16,83
for whatever reason.


634
0:25:16,83 --> 0:25:20,45



635
0:25:20,45 --> 0:25:21,44
PATRICK O'DELL: So then
"Jump Off A Building"


636
0:25:21,44 --> 0:25:22,43
was the next video?


637
0:25:22,43 --> 0:25:23,99
BRIAN ANDERSON: Oh, that's
right, yeah, "Jump Off A


638
0:25:23,99 --> 0:25:24,38
Building."


639
0:25:24,38 --> 0:25:25,88
PATRICK O'DELL: Is Donny Barley
in that, or had he


640
0:25:25,88 --> 0:25:26,38
already left?


641
0:25:26,38 --> 0:25:28,4
BRIAN ANDERSON: Nope,
Donny left.


642
0:25:28,4 --> 0:25:31,846
He just didn't jive with Ed
for a little bit there.


643
0:25:31,846 --> 0:25:33,51
ED TEMPLETON: "Jump Off A
Building" era was kind of like


644
0:25:33,51 --> 0:25:36,63
a great era but also a strange
one at the same time.


645
0:25:36,63 --> 0:25:40,35
Jamie had departed to
do Zero on his own.


646
0:25:40,35 --> 0:25:44,86
Up until that point, Jamie's
took Toy Machine from--


647
0:25:44,86 --> 0:25:47,53
obviously "Welcome to Hell" and
that whole era was a lot


648
0:25:47,53 --> 0:25:49,88
of Jamie influence.


649
0:25:49,88 --> 0:25:54,48
Me being lazy and having someone
who was super eager to


650
0:25:54,48 --> 0:25:57,62
make the team rad and do all
this-- make the video awesome.


651
0:25:57,62 --> 0:25:58,87
I was just like,
that's great--


652
0:25:58,87 --> 0:25:59,9
do that.


653
0:25:59,9 --> 0:26:1,7
When he left it was like,
oh, it's back to me.


654
0:26:1,7 --> 0:26:3,56
I've got to do this up
to the same standard


655
0:26:3,56 --> 0:26:4,57
that we just set.


656
0:26:4,57 --> 0:26:6,73
So without Jamie, it
was kind of like


657
0:26:6,73 --> 0:26:8,74
independent-contractor style.


658
0:26:8,74 --> 0:26:11,18
I expected the team to go out
and film their own stuff.


659
0:26:11,18 --> 0:26:14,9
Like go out and film--
give me the footage.


660
0:26:14,9 --> 0:26:16,29
That was that era.


661
0:26:16,29 --> 0:26:19,5
BRIAN ANDERSON: Skating was just
so easy to go film then.


662
0:26:19,5 --> 0:26:21,3
I was going out with Brad
and Moreford every day.


663
0:26:21,3 --> 0:26:22,97
And Brad would film me.


664
0:26:22,97 --> 0:26:25,86
Brad filmed tons of my
tricks in that video.


665
0:26:25,86 --> 0:26:27,92
BRAD STABA: Dude, he did this
gnarly tailslide down this


666
0:26:27,92 --> 0:26:28,46
hubba ledge.


667
0:26:28,46 --> 0:26:31,62
I videod it.


668
0:26:31,62 --> 0:26:33,97
That stood out only because
I was behind the lens.


669
0:26:33,97 --> 0:26:38,7
I really only pay attention to
stuff that involves myself.


670
0:26:38,7 --> 0:26:40,1
ED TEMPLETON: At one point, the
pressure starts coming.


671
0:26:40,1 --> 0:26:42,37
It's like, hey, we want you
to do this and that.


672
0:26:42,37 --> 0:26:45,49
We want you get a photo for an
ad, or there's another video


673
0:26:45,49 --> 0:26:46,2
we're working on.


674
0:26:46,2 --> 0:26:46,8
Let's film.


675
0:26:46,8 --> 0:26:49,63
And if your main focus is just
like, I could just as soon be


676
0:26:49,63 --> 0:26:52,28
a chef than skateboard, then
obviously you're not going to


677
0:26:52,28 --> 0:26:53,84
give your sponsor exactly
what he wants.


678
0:26:53,84 --> 0:26:55,71
I remember like just
philosophizing with him,


679
0:26:55,71 --> 0:26:58,47
saying something like, you
can do all that stuff.


680
0:26:58,47 --> 0:27:0,54
You can still become
a chef if you want.


681
0:27:0,54 --> 0:27:2,16
But you have this talent
at skateboarding.


682
0:27:2,16 --> 0:27:4,62
And you can just do this for
a couple of years and


683
0:27:4,62 --> 0:27:6,48
potentially make
a lot of money.


684
0:27:6,48 --> 0:27:10,21
And I feel like he just
switched in his head.


685
0:27:10,21 --> 0:27:12,59
He just decided, yeah, I'm
just going to slaughter


686
0:27:12,59 --> 0:27:14,94
skateboarding, and
easily did it.


687
0:27:14,94 --> 0:27:18,19
He just won the Moonster
contests when he wanted to,


688
0:27:18,19 --> 0:27:21,9
and the world championship--


689
0:27:21,9 --> 0:27:23,33
won it back-to-back, I think.


690
0:27:23,33 --> 0:27:27,2
And started just killing
contests and making big


691
0:27:27,2 --> 0:27:31,19
contest money and pretty much
put himself on the map just by


692
0:27:31,19 --> 0:27:32,39
deciding to.


693
0:27:32,39 --> 0:27:33,656
PATRICK O'DELL: How'd you find
out that you were going to be


694
0:27:33,656 --> 0:27:35,15
Skater of the Year?


695
0:27:35,15 --> 0:27:36,79
BRIAN ANDERSON: Well, Gabe said
he wanted to work on an


696
0:27:36,79 --> 0:27:40,69
article with me to get me
shooting photos for it.


697
0:27:40,69 --> 0:27:42,51
And then towards the end of the
year, I kind of realized


698
0:27:42,51 --> 0:27:44,43
what those photos were
probably for.


699
0:27:44,43 --> 0:27:47,65
I think around November
it was like--


700
0:27:47,65 --> 0:27:50,75
somebody told me, or--


701
0:27:50,75 --> 0:27:51,87
oh, and then I had to
shoot the cover.


702
0:27:51,87 --> 0:27:53,56
So I knew.


703
0:27:53,56 --> 0:27:58,14
The cover was me in a chair with
like a cigar and a fake


704
0:27:58,14 --> 0:28:0,4
Toy Machine diamond medallion.


705
0:28:0,4 --> 0:28:2,3
There's like wheels everywhere
and trucks.


706
0:28:2,3 --> 0:28:3,26
It was supposed to look
like a No Limit


707
0:28:3,26 --> 0:28:5,16
album cover, basically.


708
0:28:5,16 --> 0:28:6,83
BRAD STABA: When he got
Skater of the Year,


709
0:28:6,83 --> 0:28:7,97
it was pretty cool.


710
0:28:7,97 --> 0:28:9,54
PATRICK O'DELL: I remember
I went to that party.


711
0:28:9,54 --> 0:28:12,41
I remember it was like
Donny and Maldonado


712
0:28:12,41 --> 0:28:13,287
and all those people.


713
0:28:13,287 --> 0:28:14,54
BRAD STABA: Yeah.


714
0:28:14,54 --> 0:28:16,91
Alls I remember is I saw
him for a while.


715
0:28:16,91 --> 0:28:21,65
We hung out, and then I
guess I had his check.


716
0:28:21,65 --> 0:28:23,39
You know they give those guys
the big checks, you know?


717
0:28:23,39 --> 0:28:24,97
So I was in charge of his
check and somebody


718
0:28:24,97 --> 0:28:27,18
responsible, like Ed or
somebody, was in charge of the


719
0:28:27,18 --> 0:28:29,38
trophy, I think.


720
0:28:29,38 --> 0:28:31,94
Brian was just in charge
of blacking out.


721
0:28:31,94 --> 0:28:32,975
BRIAN ANDERSON: During
Skater of the Year--


722
0:28:32,975 --> 0:28:35,13
I'm shooting photos for
Skater of the Year--


723
0:28:35,13 --> 0:28:37,38
Monty Carol calls me and is
like, hey dude, I heard you're


724
0:28:37,38 --> 0:28:38,35
[INAUDIBLE] at Toy Machine.


725
0:28:38,35 --> 0:28:39,97
I just wanted you to know,
we could help you out


726
0:28:39,97 --> 0:28:41,25
over here at Girl.


727
0:28:41,25 --> 0:28:44,386
I'm like, wow man,
that's so nice.


728
0:28:44,386 --> 0:28:45,82
I was blown away.


729
0:28:45,82 --> 0:28:49,49
And I said, no man,
I'm not doing it.


730
0:28:49,49 --> 0:28:51,8
So I didn't do it, obviously,
and I stayed.


731
0:28:51,8 --> 0:28:52,78
But I was really sick
of Toy Machine.


732
0:28:52,78 --> 0:28:54,24
And I knew dudes were over it.


733
0:28:54,24 --> 0:28:57,25
We went on a tour, and Maldonado
was bummed, Kerry


734
0:28:57,25 --> 0:28:58,94
was bummed on Ed.


735
0:28:58,94 --> 0:29:2,41
At the end of that, I called
Rick and I was like, hey dude,


736
0:29:2,41 --> 0:29:4,86
I was wondering if that the
thing that Mike said--


737
0:29:4,86 --> 0:29:5,52
that offer--


738
0:29:5,52 --> 0:29:7,57
is still there, because I'm
kind of over this thing.


739
0:29:7,57 --> 0:29:8,875
And Rick was very concerned.


740
0:29:8,875 --> 0:29:11,94
He said, what about Ed
Templeton, dude?


741
0:29:11,94 --> 0:29:14,81
I don't want to be that guy
that takes you from Ed.


742
0:29:14,81 --> 0:29:18,55
And I was like, well dude,
I'll deal with Ed.


743
0:29:18,55 --> 0:29:19,38
I care about him--


744
0:29:19,38 --> 0:29:24,54
I love him, but this is my
progression in life.


745
0:29:24,54 --> 0:29:29,0
ED TEMPLETON: Kerry left, Bam
left, Mike left, Elissa left,


746
0:29:29,0 --> 0:29:35,6
so Brian's call was I'm going
to quit, because we have to


747
0:29:35,6 --> 0:29:38,59
rebuild Toy Machine
from where we are.


748
0:29:38,59 --> 0:29:42,43
And I don't want to do that.


749
0:29:42,43 --> 0:29:44,43
But what am I going to do?


750
0:29:44,43 --> 0:29:48,66
I based all my relationships
with the riders on the team on


751
0:29:48,66 --> 0:29:49,39
friendship.


752
0:29:49,39 --> 0:29:51,73
So none of these quittings was
like me flipping out or being


753
0:29:51,73 --> 0:29:52,33
pissed at anybody.


754
0:29:52,33 --> 0:29:54,52
It was always just like
OK, are you sure?


755
0:29:54,52 --> 0:29:56,6
OK, go for it, you know,
what can I do?


756
0:29:56,6 --> 0:29:58,27
It was sad, for sure.


757
0:29:58,27 --> 0:29:59,24
I was fully bumming.


758
0:29:59,24 --> 0:30:2,63
I've had these periods where
people have quit, and it


759
0:30:2,63 --> 0:30:5,49
leaves me no choice but to try
to get in this rebuild mode


760
0:30:5,49 --> 0:30:6,74
and try to be optimistic.


761
0:30:6,74 --> 0:30:11,47
But I can't lie when I say
there's like tearful nights


762
0:30:11,47 --> 0:30:16,1
when that stuff happens
and self-doubt


763
0:30:16,1 --> 0:30:17,44
comes into the picture.


764
0:30:17,44 --> 0:30:19,79
Am I blowing it somehow?


765
0:30:19,79 --> 0:30:21,75
Am I not not making Toy Machine
not what it can be?


766
0:30:21,75 --> 0:30:24,72
Is Girl that much better?


767
0:30:24,72 --> 0:30:27,49
How do we run stuff that makes
everyone want to quit?


768
0:30:27,49 --> 0:30:30,9
I don't know, I just
start freaking out.


769
0:30:30,9 --> 0:30:33,63
I feel good about it on the
fact that I base it on


770
0:30:33,63 --> 0:30:37,77
friendship and that I care about
Brian's career more than


771
0:30:37,77 --> 0:30:40,6
I care about my Toy
Machine business.


772
0:30:40,6 --> 0:30:42,68
So if he's going to be happy,
then I'm happy.


773
0:30:42,68 --> 0:30:47,28
Brian went on to Girl and
continued his destruction,


774
0:30:47,28 --> 0:30:50,5
basically, without
Toy Machine.


775
0:30:50,5 --> 0:30:52,96



776
0:30:52,96 --> 0:30:55,2
BRIAN ANDERSON: Me and Jake
Phelps found this on the river


777
0:30:55,2 --> 0:30:58,88
in China in Beijing, I think?


778
0:30:58,88 --> 0:31:2,31
Wait, is Beijing the one where
they cut down all the forest


779
0:31:2,31 --> 0:31:4,31
and now it's really
windy there?


780
0:31:4,31 --> 0:31:5,19
Right?


781
0:31:5,19 --> 0:31:5,81
JERRY HSU: I don't know.


782
0:31:5,81 --> 0:31:7,315
BRIAN ANDERSON: What's the
other major city there?


783
0:31:7,315 --> 0:31:8,27
JERRY HSU: Shanghai.


784
0:31:8,27 --> 0:31:10,14
BRIAN ANDERSON: Shanghai.


785
0:31:10,14 --> 0:31:12,55
What's the one with the river
going through it?


786
0:31:12,55 --> 0:31:14,83
JERRY HSU: Shanghai's
got the spots.


787
0:31:14,83 --> 0:31:17,53
PATRICK O'DELL: Jerry knows
everything about China.


788
0:31:17,53 --> 0:31:19,7
JERRY HSU: Anything else you
want to know about China, you


789
0:31:19,7 --> 0:31:21,235
could just ask me.


790
0:31:21,235 --> 0:31:22,72
BRIAN ANDERSON: This is where
I go grab my boards.


791
0:31:22,72 --> 0:31:27,19



792
0:31:27,19 --> 0:31:29,94
This is the first
in the quiver.


793
0:31:29,94 --> 0:31:32,93
I'm really proud of
my quiver, lately.


794
0:31:32,93 --> 0:31:36,15
We screwed my shoes in here.


795
0:31:36,15 --> 0:31:38,95
And I thought I was going to
be able to boardslide a


796
0:31:38,95 --> 0:31:39,85
handrail with them on.


797
0:31:39,85 --> 0:31:43,0
Just rollerskate up--


798
0:31:43,0 --> 0:31:45,2
I'm regular footed, so I thought
I could front board


799
0:31:45,2 --> 0:31:46,31
[INAUDIBLE] handrail.


800
0:31:46,31 --> 0:31:49,1
What I did was I was actually
standing on the handrail, and


801
0:31:49,1 --> 0:31:50,31
I had Frank [INAUDIBLE]


802
0:31:50,31 --> 0:31:53,4
he held me up and I balanced on
the rail, and then he ran


803
0:31:53,4 --> 0:31:55,97
away and I jumped off the
handrail in the air and he


804
0:31:55,97 --> 0:31:56,34
took the picture.


805
0:31:56,34 --> 0:31:59,2
It was pretty scary, actually.


806
0:31:59,2 --> 0:32:1,73
This is one board right now.


807
0:32:1,73 --> 0:32:2,84
This is a tapered tail.


808
0:32:2,84 --> 0:32:5,64
It's got a really good
tail for 360 flips.


809
0:32:5,64 --> 0:32:9,21
So I call this my three-flip
board.


810
0:32:9,21 --> 0:32:11,16
I'll ride my own pro board.


811
0:32:11,16 --> 0:32:13,56
Sometimes I put some stickers
kind of close to my name or


812
0:32:13,56 --> 0:32:15,46
almost over it.


813
0:32:15,46 --> 0:32:16,26
I've done that before.


814
0:32:16,26 --> 0:32:18,68
And then there are
times when like--


815
0:32:18,68 --> 0:32:22,9
what the hell, man, I should
ride my board, you know?


816
0:32:22,9 --> 0:32:25,45
This board totally sucks
to skate but I


817
0:32:25,45 --> 0:32:26,98
put it together recently.


818
0:32:26,98 --> 0:32:29,57
It's a Steve Alba, obviously.


819
0:32:29,57 --> 0:32:33,9
I spent a lot of time on the
sticker job on the top.


820
0:32:33,9 --> 0:32:38,23
Probably some serious Buddha
involved with that one.


821
0:32:38,23 --> 0:32:40,47
Yeah, Efil4zaggin, man--


822
0:32:40,47 --> 0:32:43,13
I forgot all about
Efil4zaggin.


823
0:32:43,13 --> 0:32:44,59
PATRICK O'DELL: What's
Efil4zaggin?


824
0:32:44,59 --> 0:32:46,1
BRIAN ANDERSON: I think
it's the NWA record.


825
0:32:46,1 --> 0:32:48,36
It's Niggaz4Life backwards.


826
0:32:48,36 --> 0:32:50,945
This is my real Steve Olsen.


827
0:32:50,945 --> 0:32:52,4
And that's it.


828
0:32:52,4 --> 0:32:52,89
This one's really fun.


829
0:32:52,89 --> 0:32:55,45
So my quiver is up to--


830
0:32:55,45 --> 0:32:56,7
these don't count--


831
0:32:56,7 --> 0:33:0,33



832
0:33:0,33 --> 0:33:1,2
seven.


833
0:33:1,2 --> 0:33:2,7
That's pretty cool.


834
0:33:2,7 --> 0:33:4,7
And I skate them all,
like all week long.


835
0:33:4,7 --> 0:33:6,49
That's it.


836
0:33:6,49 --> 0:33:8,77
PATRICK O'DELL: What skaters are
out now or that you know


837
0:33:8,77 --> 0:33:10,22
that really inspire you?


838
0:33:10,22 --> 0:33:11,87
BRIAN ANDERSON: Well, my
favorite skater is probably


839
0:33:11,87 --> 0:33:12,47
Nick Trapasso.


840
0:33:12,47 --> 0:33:14,55
And oh, you know my
all-time favorite


841
0:33:14,55 --> 0:33:16,97
skater ever is Ben Schroeder.


842
0:33:16,97 --> 0:33:18,94
He inspired me.


843
0:33:18,94 --> 0:33:20,74
Even the guys in my neighborhood
I grew up with


844
0:33:20,74 --> 0:33:23,92
were always like man,
Schroeder-- that guy's just


845
0:33:23,92 --> 0:33:25,36
kind of a beast.


846
0:33:25,36 --> 0:33:28,6
And I think as I got
older I got taller.


847
0:33:28,6 --> 0:33:29,9
So when I actually see
him live now, I'm


848
0:33:29,9 --> 0:33:31,22
like whoa, I get it.


849
0:33:31,22 --> 0:33:34,76
That's why I understand what
he does, because it's like


850
0:33:34,76 --> 0:33:36,72
he's bigger than me, for sure.


851
0:33:36,72 --> 0:33:38,635
But he's pretty oafy, and
it's like the best.


852
0:33:38,635 --> 0:33:41,35
I love it.


853
0:33:41,35 --> 0:33:42,3
PATRICK O'DELL: What about--


854
0:33:42,3 --> 0:33:44,82
you were telling Jake that you
didn't read the magazines.


855
0:33:44,82 --> 0:33:46,83
BRIAN ANDERSON: Oh, yeah,
just a long time ago.


856
0:33:46,83 --> 0:33:47,88
It was like--


857
0:33:47,88 --> 0:33:49,82
well, I'll be 33 this summer--


858
0:33:49,82 --> 0:33:54,41
so it must have been three
years ago or something.


859
0:33:54,41 --> 0:33:57,35
I don't remember
the situation.


860
0:33:57,35 --> 0:33:59,75
He asked me something and
I was like, dude, I'm


861
0:33:59,75 --> 0:34:1,155
30 years old, man.


862
0:34:1,155 --> 0:34:3,99
I don't read the mags.


863
0:34:3,99 --> 0:34:7,91
And he just loved that
for some reason.


864
0:34:7,91 --> 0:34:9,139
I wasn't trying to be funny.


865
0:34:9,139 --> 0:34:11,371
I was like, I don't know dude,
I'm trying to not look at


866
0:34:11,371 --> 0:34:12,57
those things.


867
0:34:12,57 --> 0:34:13,799
JAKE PHELPS: You had
that same shirt in


868
0:34:13,799 --> 0:34:15,1
the Jerry Hsu episode.


869
0:34:15,1 --> 0:34:16,266
PATRICK O'DELL: Yeah.


870
0:34:16,266 --> 0:34:17,516
I wear it a lot.


871
0:34:17,516 --> 0:34:20,23



872
0:34:20,23 --> 0:34:22,574
You got anything to
say about Brian?


873
0:34:22,574 --> 0:34:24,5
Can you--


874
0:34:24,5 --> 0:34:25,154
JAKE PHELPS: Encapsulate it?


875
0:34:25,154 --> 0:34:27,719
PATRICK O'DELL: Yeah.


876
0:34:27,719 --> 0:34:29,38
JAKE PHELPS: He's just a
good, solid boarder.


877
0:34:29,38 --> 0:34:31,139
He's easy on the eyes.


878
0:34:31,139 --> 0:34:34,477
I hate to say it, but a lot of
people try wicked hard and


879
0:34:34,477 --> 0:34:36,3
they end up missing it.


880
0:34:36,3 --> 0:34:37,389
But Brian--


881
0:34:37,389 --> 0:34:39,33
he comes in the park--
he does a full line


882
0:34:39,33 --> 0:34:42,42
when he comes in here.


883
0:34:42,42 --> 0:34:42,5
BRIAN ANDERSON: OK.


884
0:34:42,5 --> 0:34:44,199
JAKE PHELPS: What are
you going to make?


885
0:34:44,199 --> 0:34:44,76
Is it possible?


886
0:34:44,76 --> 0:34:45,61
BRIAN ANDERSON: Change it up.


887
0:34:45,61 --> 0:34:47,5
JAKE PHELPS: Spice it
up a little bit?


888
0:34:47,5 --> 0:34:50,1
BRIAN ANDERSON: Switch,
slappy, half-gallon--


889
0:34:50,1 --> 0:34:51,19
JAKE PHELPS: Oh, this is sick.


890
0:34:51,19 --> 0:34:52,63
This is my favorite line.


891
0:34:52,63 --> 0:34:54,58
This switch slappie on that
wall of doom is gnarly.


892
0:34:54,58 --> 0:34:55,42
Watch this.


893
0:34:55,42 --> 0:35:12,849
Go get them, B. Yeah!


894
0:35:12,849 --> 0:35:16,3



895
0:35:16,3 --> 0:35:17,779
Are you okay?


896
0:35:17,779 --> 0:35:20,737
BRIAN ANDERSON: Shit,
I'm going slow.


897
0:35:20,737 --> 0:35:24,73
JAKE PHELPS: Black socks
and shit, that's hard.


898
0:35:24,73 --> 0:35:26,49
Back tail-- oh, here it comes.


899
0:35:26,49 --> 0:35:29,752
15 seconds, world cup.


900
0:35:29,752 --> 0:35:30,94
Yes, and that's time.


901
0:35:30,94 --> 0:35:32,71
Did you see it?


902
0:35:32,71 --> 0:35:35,84
15 seconds, Daniel and Bostic
where's my wine?


903
0:35:35,84 --> 0:35:37,9
Fucking bitch.


904
0:35:37,9 --> 0:35:41,42



905
0:35:41,42 --> 0:35:42,425
PATRICK O'DELL: Is that
why you gave him


906
0:35:42,425 --> 0:35:42,86
Skater of the Year?


907
0:35:42,86 --> 0:35:43,84
JAKE PHELPS: Why I gave him
Skater of the Year?


908
0:35:43,84 --> 0:35:45,62
PATRICK O'DELL: Or why he
won Skater of the Year?


909
0:35:45,62 --> 0:35:49,21
JAKE PHELPS: Well, he was Skater
of the Year because


910
0:35:49,21 --> 0:35:50,755
he's just a solid dude.


911
0:35:50,755 --> 0:35:55,25
He repps the mag and people
that are good.


912
0:35:55,25 --> 0:35:59,1
I mean, it's a pretty
illustrious crew.


913
0:35:59,1 --> 0:36:0,89
Some people win, some
people don't.


914
0:36:0,89 --> 0:36:2,14
Chad Muska never got it, fuck.


915
0:36:2,14 --> 0:36:4,735



916
0:36:4,735 --> 0:36:6,13
BRIAN ANDERSON: It's going
to be mad rewarding, son.


917
0:36:6,13 --> 0:36:13,67



918
0:36:13,67 --> 0:36:16,2
I was watching like a baseball
game, and you see the coach


919
0:36:16,2 --> 0:36:18,92
out there, and he's
like 65 years old.


920
0:36:18,92 --> 0:36:21,83
I kind of realized he's coaching
because he loves


921
0:36:21,83 --> 0:36:23,2
baseball, obviously.


922
0:36:23,2 --> 0:36:25,535
So that made me feel better
about the future of


923
0:36:25,535 --> 0:36:25,67
skateboarding.


924
0:36:25,67 --> 0:36:30,87
Like well, it wouldn't be
strange if I stayed and worked


925
0:36:30,87 --> 0:36:32,87
in skateboarding, I guess,
because it's something I


926
0:36:32,87 --> 0:36:34,414
really like.


927
0:36:34,414 --> 0:36:36,625
You know, like how somebody
would like baseball or


928
0:36:36,625 --> 0:36:38,35
basketball.


929
0:36:38,35 --> 0:36:40,4
Because sometimes you think
like, dude, this


930
0:36:40,4 --> 0:36:41,5
skateboarding thing.


931
0:36:41,5 --> 0:36:42,933
You see some bozos skating
down the street and


932
0:36:42,933 --> 0:36:44,75
you're like, ugh.


933
0:36:44,75 --> 0:36:46,5
But for us it's different.


934
0:36:46,5 --> 0:36:47,65
We really, really like it.


935
0:36:47,65 --> 0:36:48,52
So fuck--


936
0:36:48,52 --> 0:36:49,53
I mean, why not?


937
0:36:49,53 --> 0:36:52,66
I should be proud of that
and enjoy that, so--


938
0:36:52,66 --> 0:36:55,342
it was kind of like something
I just told myself, or had a


939
0:36:55,342 --> 0:36:58,639
realization that everything's
okay.


940
0:36:58,639 --> 0:37:1,0
JAKE PHELPS: Ta-da!


941
0:37:1,0 --> 0:37:1,89
BRIAN ANDERSON: I like
that switch grip.


942
0:37:1,89 --> 0:37:3,14
It was the one I wanted to do.


943
0:37:3,14 --> 0:37:5,49



944
0:37:5,49 --> 0:37:5,91
Thanks, Pat.


945
0:37:5,91 --> 0:37:6,162
It was fun.


946
0:37:6,162 --> 0:37:7,412
PATRICK O'DELL: Thank
you, Brian.


947
0:37:7,412 --> 0:39:7,412
