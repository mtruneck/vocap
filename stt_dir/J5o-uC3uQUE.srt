2
0:0:12,316 --> 0:0:26,313
According to a report by the United Nations, since 1947
more than 150 million people have been witnesses to UFO
sightings throughout the world. More than 20,000 of those
have been documented landings.


3
0:0:26,313 --> 0:0:39,0
A Roper poll conducted in the United States reported that
70% of the U.S. population believe that the government is
not telling the public everything it know about UFOs and
extraterrestrials.


4
0:0:39,0 --> 0:0:41,1
We're dealing with the biggest
story of the millennium.


5
0:0:41,1 --> 0:0:43,701
Visits to planet earth
by alien spacecraft.


6
0:0:43,701 --> 0:0:45,551
Successful cover-up
of the best data.


7
0:0:45,551 --> 0:0:47,5
Bodies and wreckage!


8
0:0:47,5 --> 0:0:48,851
For 58 years.


9
0:0:48,851 --> 0:0:50,936
The bottom line is
I don't believe


10
0:0:50,936 --> 0:0:53,1
the claim of the
Air force that...


11
0:0:53,1 --> 0:0:54,626
all sightings can
be explained.


12
0:0:54,626 --> 0:0:56,27
This is the
biggest secret


13
0:0:56,27 --> 0:0:57,528
in the history
of the human race


14
0:0:57,528 --> 0:0:58,929
and particularly in
the history


15
0:0:58,929 --> 0:0:59,93
of modern
government.


16
0:0:59,93 --> 0:1:2,31
We are being engaged
as a planet and


17
0:1:2,31 --> 0:1:4,896
as a species by
other beings.


18
0:1:4,896 --> 0:1:8,1
The Canadian government
is how I actually proved


19
0:1:8,1 --> 0:1:11,401
that the U.S. government was
covering up their collection


20
0:1:11,401 --> 0:1:13,501
of UFO sightings
and records.


21
0:1:13,501 --> 0:1:16,402
America and Britain
had made it very clear,


22
0:1:16,402 --> 0:1:19,25
to allot of countries who have
the same sort of sightings


23
0:1:19,25 --> 0:1:21,601
and the same resources,
that this is something that


24
0:1:21,601 --> 0:1:23,626
they better
not let out.


25
0:1:23,626 --> 0:1:25,701
Not until we
say it's OK.


26
0:1:25,701 --> 0:1:28,451
If we would get off
of this 'ego-trip',


27
0:1:28,451 --> 0:1:32,852
this western scientific 'ego-trip',
we would not become the virus


28
0:1:32,852 --> 0:1:34,351
of the universe
that we are.


29
0:1:34,351 --> 0:1:36,351
Nobody really
wants us out there.


30
0:1:36,351 --> 0:1:39,352
The dependence on oil
could be ended over night.


31
0:1:39,352 --> 0:1:43,431
We're being slowly conditioned to
understand that there is life


32
0:1:43,431 --> 0:1:46,232
outside this planet and
that we probably live in a


33
0:1:46,232 --> 0:1:48,851
universe and a galaxy,
teeming with life.


34
0:1:48,851 --> 0:1:51,852
I had my own UFO sighting and
said, well, case closed.


35
0:1:51,852 --> 0:1:53,751
There's nothing like seeing
one for yourself


36
0:1:53,751 --> 0:1:55,561
to end the debate.


37
0:1:55,561 --> 0:1:59,601
Are we absolutely sure that we
are not alone in this universe?


38
0:1:59,601 --> 0:2:2,202
We invite you now to come
with us upon a great


39
0:2:2,202 --> 0:2:3,803
and wondrous journey.


40
0:2:3,803 --> 0:2:5,814
An adventure, perhaps,
into your very own


41
0:2:5,814 --> 0:2:6,626
past


42
0:2:6,626 --> 0:2:7,227
present


43
0:2:7,227 --> 0:2:9,105
and future.


44
0:2:9,105 --> 0:2:10,611
See and hear the real stories


45
0:2:10,611 --> 0:2:12,12
and most importantly


46
0:2:12,12 --> 0:2:14,401
be introduced to
the actual individuals


47
0:2:14,401 --> 0:3:18,496
who have volunteered to come
forward to speak the truth.


48
0:3:18,496 --> 0:3:21,701
Do Flying saucers exist?


49
0:3:21,701 --> 0:3:24,701
Are extraterrestrials real?


50
0:3:24,701 --> 0:3:27,596
Is there a government cover-up?


51
0:3:27,596 --> 0:3:30,541
For nearly 60 years,
denial has been the only


52
0:3:30,541 --> 0:3:33,1
official position of the
governments of the world,


53
0:3:33,1 --> 0:3:34,843
relative to UFOs,


54
0:3:34,843 --> 0:3:36,15
alien abductions


55
0:3:36,15 --> 0:3:39,21
and extraterrestrial
contactee reports.


56
0:3:39,21 --> 0:3:41,206
Endless debates
have raged over the


57
0:3:41,206 --> 0:3:43,407
thousands of documented
cases, that have been


58
0:3:43,407 --> 0:3:45,996
brought forward without
official recognition.


59
0:3:45,996 --> 0:3:48,981
Some have been
monumental incidents


60
0:3:48,981 --> 0:3:56,401
involving 100's or even
1000's of people.


61
0:3:56,401 --> 0:3:58,361
A flying disc crashed.


62
0:3:58,361 --> 0:4:10,301
The debris and alien bodies were flown to
Wright Field Air force Base, in Dayton, Ohio.


63
0:4:10,301 --> 0:4:12,61
A triangular shaped object


64
0:4:12,61 --> 0:4:14,751
illuminated the entire
forest with white light.


65
0:4:14,751 --> 0:4:16,852
The object had a
pulsing red light on top


66
0:4:16,852 --> 0:4:18,753
and a bank of blue
lights underneath.


67
0:4:18,753 --> 0:4:21,854
It left ground traces, and
radioactive anomalies.


68
0:4:21,854 --> 0:4:33,355
This was a multiple witness
sighting by military personnel.


69
0:4:33,355 --> 0:4:35,45
100's of reports
of lighted objects


70
0:4:35,45 --> 0:4:38,657
frequently described as
enormous and triangular in shape.


71
0:4:38,657 --> 0:4:42,11
Air force F16s chased
many of these objects.


72
0:4:42,11 --> 0:4:53,151
The Belgian government cooperated
with civilian UFO investigation.


73
0:4:53,151 --> 0:4:55,861
A huge V shaped object
hovered over Phoenix


74
0:4:55,861 --> 0:4:57,362
for 10 to 15 minutes,


75
0:4:57,362 --> 0:5:4,57
observed by tens of
thousands of people.


76
0:5:4,57 --> 0:5:7,651
Hundreds of objects
appearing alone and in clusters


77
0:5:7,651 --> 0:5:9,151
appear throughout Mexico,


78
0:5:9,151 --> 0:5:23,561
observed by tens of
thousands of people.


79
0:5:23,561 --> 0:5:26,801
Flying saucers are real.


80
0:5:26,801 --> 0:5:29,236
On the Blackvault you
can download documents


81
0:5:29,236 --> 0:5:32,441
that prove that the United
States Air Force bases


82
0:5:32,441 --> 0:5:35,691
have been breached by
UFOs, (their restricted airspace.)


83
0:5:35,691 --> 0:5:38,841
That missile silos have
mysteriously been shut down


84
0:5:38,841 --> 0:5:42,206
due to UFOs hovering
over the base.


85
0:5:42,206 --> 0:5:44,51
I think you download
that and you read it,


86
0:5:44,51 --> 0:5:46,312
err, you conclude,
yeah, OK. UFOs pose


87
0:5:46,312 --> 0:5:48,996
a national security threat
to the U.S. government.


88
0:5:48,996 --> 0:5:50,766
In 1952 I was
an 8th grader


89
0:5:50,766 --> 0:5:52,167
and old enough to
read for myself


90
0:5:52,167 --> 0:5:55,239
the big screen
headlines that July about


91
0:5:55,239 --> 0:5:57,54
UFOs flying over
the nationâ€™s capitol,


92
0:5:57,54 --> 0:6:1,741
and the air force planes not
being able to catch them.


93
0:6:1,741 --> 0:6:4,846
They're there, and
they're paying attention.


94
0:6:4,846 --> 0:6:8,411
Incidents happened in the
Soviet Union before it collapsed


95
0:6:8,411 --> 0:6:11,431
Incidents happened all
over the northern U.S.


96
0:6:11,431 --> 0:6:13,684
at I.C.B.M. bases,


97
0:6:13,684 --> 0:6:15,401
where they came down


98
0:6:15,401 --> 0:6:17,401
hovered over the silos


99
0:6:17,401 --> 0:6:20,881
and played hell with
the electronics.


100
0:6:20,881 --> 0:6:22,801
Pictures were taken.


101
0:6:22,801 --> 0:6:26,621
Hundreds of witnesses
watched them.


102
0:6:26,621 --> 0:6:28,581
It's highly classified,
you'll never hear about it.


103
0:6:28,581 --> 0:6:32,86
except from whistleblowers
and bigmouths like me!


104
0:6:32,86 --> 0:6:35,836
While I was attending
Northrop Aeronautical Institute


105
0:6:35,836 --> 0:6:37,901
and working for


106
0:6:37,901 --> 0:6:41,881
Douglas Aircraft in
El Segundo, California.


107
0:6:41,881 --> 0:6:46,31
I had heard about George
Adamski in one of the


108
0:6:46,31 --> 0:6:47,291
Sunday newspapers.


109
0:6:47,291 --> 0:6:50,5
He had his story and
his pictures of contacts


110
0:6:50,5 --> 0:6:52,41
plus pictures
of his ships.


111
0:6:52,41 --> 0:6:54,642
Well I had, by that
time, seen so many


112
0:6:54,642 --> 0:6:55,843
during the day
and the night


113
0:6:55,843 --> 0:6:57,244
that I felt


114
0:6:57,244 --> 0:7:0,45
I would like to go up
and meet this gentleman.


115
0:7:0,45 --> 0:7:2,46
On the weekend he
would entertain people


116
0:7:2,46 --> 0:7:4,31
who had come
to see him.


117
0:7:4,31 --> 0:7:7,403
Military people,
engineers, scientists.


118
0:7:7,403 --> 0:7:9,32
People from all
walks of life.


119
0:7:9,32 --> 0:7:12,286
He had taken some
beautiful pictures of the


120
0:7:12,286 --> 0:7:15,381
scout craft as well
as the carrier ships.


121
0:7:15,381 --> 0:7:16,682
I went up
to see him.


122
0:7:16,682 --> 0:7:18,621
He had a 6 inch
telescope that he used


123
0:7:18,621 --> 0:7:21,51
to take the pictures
of the flying saucers.


124
0:7:21,51 --> 0:7:22,852
And in using that scope,


125
0:7:22,852 --> 0:7:24,353
when I had finished


126
0:7:24,353 --> 0:7:27,254
I was just about to take
my eye off the eyepiece


127
0:7:27,254 --> 0:7:30,502
when there was a
blue/white streak


128
0:7:30,502 --> 0:7:31,601
that went by


129
0:7:31,601 --> 0:7:36,331
and I jerked my head up to
see if I could see it and I didn't.


130
0:7:36,331 --> 0:7:40,5
I looked at his 15
inch telescope dome


131
0:7:40,5 --> 0:7:44,576
which was a couple of
hundred yards from his house


132
0:7:44,576 --> 0:7:48,377
and there was a BIG
flare of blue/white light


133
0:7:48,377 --> 0:7:51,451
and then it kind of closed
back down, no noise.


134
0:7:51,451 --> 0:7:53,116
At first I thought it was
an explosion, but it


135
0:7:53,116 --> 0:7:55,681
was a little
slower than that.


136
0:7:55,681 --> 0:7:59,982
And there was an
elliptical flying saucer


137
0:7:59,982 --> 0:8:2,449
Looked to me like it was
hovering above the ground.


138
0:8:2,449 --> 0:8:5,0
So I heard it
increase its frequency


139
0:8:5,0 --> 0:8:6,451
and it got brighter
and brighter,


140
0:8:6,451 --> 0:8:8,401
and it was really
pretty hard to look at.


141
0:8:8,401 --> 0:8:10,425
And it shot
straight up,


142
0:8:10,425 --> 0:8:13,496
until it looked like
one of the stars.


143
0:8:13,496 --> 0:8:16,214
If you've ever been to Mount
Panama at night, on a dark night,


144
0:8:16,214 --> 0:8:18,281
boy they're
big and bright!


145
0:8:18,281 --> 0:8:23,281
And it stopped for an instant, and then
it shot over the horizon over San Diego.


146
0:8:23,281 --> 0:8:27,101
We have more than 1 witness
who have been involved in the


147
0:8:27,101 --> 0:8:28,881
tracking of these
objects on radar.


148
0:8:28,881 --> 0:8:30,101
and many
people say,


149
0:8:30,101 --> 0:8:31,902
well look if this
stuff is real,


150
0:8:31,902 --> 0:8:33,51
why are there
no radar reports?


151
0:8:33,51 --> 0:8:33,801
I said, we have them!


152
0:8:33,801 --> 0:8:35,301
We actually have
the radar tapes!


153
0:8:35,301 --> 0:8:36,801
From the
F.A.A.!


154
0:8:36,801 --> 0:8:40,74
This is not just UFOs,
and this is not just not


155
0:8:40,74 --> 0:8:45,141
being visited by
guys from other planets.


156
0:8:45,141 --> 0:8:48,24
I was to learn later that


157
0:8:48,24 --> 0:8:49,131
our security,


158
0:8:49,131 --> 0:8:50,232
our intelligence
people,


159
0:8:50,232 --> 0:8:51,933
our military people,


160
0:8:51,933 --> 0:8:53,35
concluded and learned,


161
0:8:53,35 --> 0:8:57,269
we're not merely dealing with
inter-planetary visitation.


162
0:8:57,269 --> 0:9:1,37
We were being visited by
guys from other star systems.


163
0:9:1,37 --> 0:9:3,871
Which, technologically we
know what that means.


164
0:9:3,871 --> 0:9:8,681
They're not just from another like planet
like Venus or Mars or somewhere!


165
0:9:8,681 --> 0:9:10,382
These guys are
from other stars.


166
0:9:10,382 --> 0:9:16,183
Iâ€™m convinced after
studies since 1958


167
0:9:16,183 --> 0:9:17,684
that the evidence
is overwhelming


168
0:9:17,684 --> 0:9:19,401
and planet earth
is being visited by


169
0:9:19,401 --> 0:9:22,285
intelligently controlled
extraterrestrial spacecraft,


170
0:9:22,285 --> 0:9:25,651
in other words, some
UFOs are alien spacecraft.


171
0:9:25,651 --> 0:9:27,751
Most are not, I don't
care about those!


172
0:9:27,751 --> 0:9:29,301
Most isotopes
aren't fissionable,


173
0:9:29,301 --> 0:9:30,901
I don't care about
the ones that aren't,


174
0:9:30,901 --> 0:9:32,301
if I'm going to
build a reactor!


175
0:9:32,301 --> 0:9:35,286
If somebody who had the
clearance to carry nuclear weapons


176
0:9:35,286 --> 0:9:37,336
or launch nuclear weapons


177
0:9:37,336 --> 0:9:40,137
saw these objects
over a nuclear facility


178
0:9:40,137 --> 0:9:43,336
and reported it, and have
documents to prove it happened


179
0:9:43,336 --> 0:9:44,876
this is dispositive


180
0:9:44,876 --> 0:9:47,577
that's what someone who
is wanting to look into this


181
0:9:47,577 --> 0:9:50,201
who says, well, could this really
be true and I don't know about it?


182
0:9:50,201 --> 0:9:52,1
They need to look at that,
and we've assembled it.


183
0:9:52,1 --> 0:9:53,967
We have a 600
page book of


184
0:9:53,967 --> 0:9:56,753
top secret documents and the
transcripts of these witnesses.


185
0:9:56,753 --> 0:9:57,701
We have videotape.


186
0:9:57,701 --> 0:10:1,351
So I began watching the newspapers
for any newspaper reports,


187
0:10:1,351 --> 0:10:4,552
I started buying magazines that
had a UFO article in the magazine


188
0:10:4,552 --> 0:10:6,111
and collecting these and


189
0:10:6,111 --> 0:10:9,412
from those I would
get names and addresses.


190
0:10:9,412 --> 0:10:12,612
And I often called the people
that wrote the articles to get them.


191
0:10:12,612 --> 0:10:14,476
Then I would go interview
those people myself,


192
0:10:14,476 --> 0:10:15,501
and if they 
took pictures,


193
0:10:15,501 --> 0:10:17,701
then I would try to get 
a copy of the pictures.


194
0:10:17,701 --> 0:10:19,702
and frequently did!


195
0:10:19,702 --> 0:10:21,16
And then I 
began,


196
0:10:21,16 --> 0:10:24,203
trading the pictures that I already had 
with other people that had pictures,


197
0:10:24,203 --> 0:10:25,804
to get more 
pictures, and


198
0:10:25,804 --> 0:10:27,605
eventually built a library
of pictures, probably


199
0:10:27,605 --> 0:10:29,35
the largest in private
hands in the world


200
0:10:29,35 --> 0:10:32,207
its over 4000,
pictures of real UFOs.


201
0:10:32,207 --> 0:10:34,508
Now, if I can collect
that many alone,


202
0:10:34,508 --> 0:10:36,209
as a single individual


203
0:10:36,209 --> 0:10:38,51
working by myself,


204
0:10:38,51 --> 0:10:40,101
how many pictures do you
think the government has got,


205
0:10:40,101 --> 0:10:44,116
when every government employee
is a potential investigator,


206
0:10:44,116 --> 0:10:47,131
and every agent is a
trained investigator,


207
0:10:47,131 --> 0:10:51,17
all collecting and contributing
to the government files


208
0:10:51,17 --> 0:10:53,201
they must have
hangers full of pictures!


209
0:10:53,201 --> 0:10:56,505
What Air force manual
10-206 says is that


210
0:10:56,505 --> 0:10:58,216
a U.S. Air force pilot,


211
0:10:58,216 --> 0:11:0,17
who sees a UFO.


212
0:11:0,17 --> 0:11:3,318
Has to report it in a
particular way and manner.


213
0:11:3,318 --> 0:11:7,696
They outline in this form,
exactly how to report it.


214
0:11:7,696 --> 0:11:9,503
They say, list
the size.


215
0:11:9,503 --> 0:11:10,551
The shape.


216
0:11:10,551 --> 0:11:11,752
Direction of travel.


217
0:11:11,752 --> 0:11:13,541
How big the
object was.


218
0:11:13,541 --> 0:11:15,216
What were the
wind conditions like?


219
0:11:15,216 --> 0:11:16,917
And you go
through this big form,


220
0:11:16,917 --> 0:11:17,918
and say, you know,


221
0:11:17,918 --> 0:11:19,719
your UFO sighting.


222
0:11:19,719 --> 0:11:21,62
The manual then
goes on to state


223
0:11:21,62 --> 0:11:23,521
that you have
to forward this


224
0:11:23,521 --> 0:11:25,622
to the NORAD installation.


225
0:11:25,622 --> 0:11:27,623
This is that one Air
force base that claims


226
0:11:27,623 --> 0:11:31,224
Oh no, we haven't collected
these things since 1969.


227
0:11:31,224 --> 0:11:32,925
The problem is
that this form


228
0:11:32,925 --> 0:11:35,826
was last updated in
October of 2004.


229
0:11:35,826 --> 0:11:41,313
In 1977 I proposed and
became a director of a


230
0:11:41,313 --> 0:11:44,233
proposed extraterrestrial
communications study


231
0:11:44,233 --> 0:11:46,134
done in conjunction with the


232
0:11:46,134 --> 0:11:48,35
Jimmy Carter Whitehouse.


233
0:11:48,35 --> 0:11:53,236
Jimmy Carter, of course,
had had a close encounter


234
0:11:53,236 --> 0:11:56,237
with a UFO, in the company of


235
0:11:56,237 --> 0:12:1,638
10 members of the Leary
Georgia Lions Club in 1969


236
0:12:1,638 --> 0:12:3,858
while he was running
for governor of Georgia.


237
0:12:3,858 --> 0:12:6,936
While he was governor
of Georgia in 1973,


238
0:12:6,936 --> 0:12:11,67
he had filed an official
UFO report, it's now


239
0:12:11,67 --> 0:12:16,26
on the internet, so
everybody can see it.


240
0:12:16,26 --> 0:12:18,241
The 1976


241
0:12:18,241 --> 0:12:21,342
U.S. Presidential campaign
was extraordinary,


242
0:12:21,342 --> 0:12:25,8
because it was waged
between Jimmy Carter,


243
0:12:25,8 --> 0:12:28,311
on the one hand, he's
had a close encounter.


244
0:12:28,311 --> 0:12:32,512
And the first campaign,
waged on a platform,


245
0:12:32,512 --> 0:12:36,701
which included a
disclosure plank, of sorts.


246
0:12:36,701 --> 0:12:39,702
Jimmy Carter was asked,
on various occasions,


247
0:12:39,702 --> 0:12:41,403
and this is documented.


248
0:12:41,403 --> 0:12:43,926
Once elected,
would he open up


249
0:12:43,926 --> 0:12:46,6
the extraterrestrial
UFO files.


250
0:12:46,6 --> 0:12:47,228
And he said:


251
0:12:47,228 --> 0:12:47,929
YES


252
0:12:47,929 --> 0:12:48,53
HE WOULD.


253
0:12:48,53 --> 0:12:53,911
We have over 450 military
and intelligence witnesses.


254
0:12:53,911 --> 0:12:55,456
Some are, they
range from,


255
0:12:55,456 --> 0:12:57,157
Generals and Brigadier Generals.


256
0:12:57,157 --> 0:13:1,351
To Air Traffic Controllers and
Strategic Air Command personnel,


257
0:13:1,351 --> 0:13:2,251
in the Air force.


258
0:13:2,251 --> 0:13:5,631
To civilian people
in the F.A.A.


259
0:13:5,631 --> 0:13:8,441
The Federal Aviation
Administration.


260
0:13:8,441 --> 0:13:10,442
To Astronauts and Cosmonauts.


261
0:13:10,442 --> 0:13:13,96
And it's an enormous database of,


262
0:13:13,96 --> 0:13:16,502
of people who have up close
and personally seen


263
0:13:16,502 --> 0:13:20,103
UFOs or worked
in those projects,


264
0:13:20,103 --> 0:13:24,304
in their capacity as a
government or military person.


265
0:13:24,304 --> 0:13:26,6
Even with the massive
amount of pressure


266
0:13:26,6 --> 0:13:30,566
governments can exert to
maintain the ongoing cover-up,


267
0:13:30,566 --> 0:13:32,988
people continue to
come forward and tell


268
0:13:32,988 --> 0:13:35,189
what they have
personally experienced.


269
0:13:35,189 --> 0:13:36,49
Whoosh! - Like that!


270
0:13:36,49 --> 0:13:39,709
15 miles in a
fraction of a second.


271
0:13:39,709 --> 0:13:41,691
I disengaged the autopilot


272
0:13:41,691 --> 0:13:42,621
to push the nose
over because


273
0:13:42,621 --> 0:13:44,801
we were on a
collision course.


274
0:13:44,801 --> 0:13:46,402
And when I did,


275
0:13:46,402 --> 0:13:49,101
I just saw it head-on. It
was 300 feet in diameter.


276
0:13:49,101 --> 0:13:50,831
We knew that, but we
had only known that


277
0:13:50,831 --> 0:13:52,632
because somebody was
telling us, 300 feet in diameter!


278
0:13:52,632 --> 0:13:54,896
So at that time, I
heard a hell of a noise!


279
0:13:54,896 --> 0:13:55,797
and I said to Fred,


280
0:13:55,797 --> 0:13:57,198
What the hell
was that?


281
0:13:57,198 --> 0:13:57,499
He said:


282
0:13:57,499 --> 0:14:1,176
Well, the navigator and
the radioman ducking,


283
0:14:1,176 --> 0:14:3,577
fell, hit their head,
one hit, hurt their arm,


284
0:14:3,577 --> 0:14:5,478
they were scrambling on the
deck, so a hell of a noise!


285
0:14:5,478 --> 0:14:7,779
I thought it had hit
us underneath!


286
0:14:7,779 --> 0:14:9,78
So I said, well, where
in the hell did it go?


287
0:14:9,78 --> 0:14:11,781
And Fred said, it's right
over to the right.


288
0:14:11,781 --> 0:14:14,782
I couldn't see it,
so it drifted far.


289
0:14:14,782 --> 0:14:16,883
About 5 miles away,


290
0:14:16,883 --> 0:14:17,984
It never got
to the altitude


291
0:14:17,984 --> 0:14:19,385
that we were at.


292
0:14:19,385 --> 0:14:20,886
A few hundred
feet below.


293
0:14:20,886 --> 0:14:22,187
I begin to
watch it, well,


294
0:14:22,187 --> 0:14:24,288
we knew then it was
a friendly encounter,


295
0:14:24,288 --> 0:14:26,489
it just wanted
us to see it!


296
0:14:26,489 --> 0:14:29,894
So then I went to engage
the autopilot again.


297
0:14:29,894 --> 0:14:33,395
The magnetic compass
was going like this!


298
0:14:33,395 --> 0:14:36,96
and the Bird Dogs, which
is a directional finder,


299
0:14:36,96 --> 0:14:38,297
Two of the Bird Dogs are
pointing right at this thing,


300
0:14:38,297 --> 0:14:39,798
just vibrating like this!


301
0:14:39,798 --> 0:14:41,986
And it was allot of the
electrical things in the airplane,


302
0:14:41,986 --> 0:14:43,587
that went haywire!


303
0:14:43,587 --> 0:14:44,688
So, I told Fred


304
0:14:44,688 --> 0:14:45,589
Did you see that coming?


305
0:14:45,589 --> 0:14:49,431
He said, as it was coming
closer it was doing this!


306
0:14:49,431 --> 0:14:52,432
And so, I went back to the
vacuum operated desk


307
0:14:52,432 --> 0:14:55,201
The whole airplane was vacuum operated
and hydraulically operated controls,


308
0:14:55,201 --> 0:14:56,801
so I'd go back
to that side.


309
0:14:56,801 --> 0:14:58,702
So then we'd sit there
and watch it for a while,


310
0:14:58,702 --> 0:15:0,731
because it just paced
us, stayed with us!


311
0:15:0,731 --> 0:15:1,632
And so the other crew


312
0:15:1,632 --> 0:15:2,833
knew how to land
the large engines


313
0:15:2,833 --> 0:15:4,734
so I was sent back
and they came forth.


314
0:15:4,734 --> 0:15:5,735
Al Jones,


315
0:15:5,735 --> 0:15:7,336
which was the Regional
Plane Commander,


316
0:15:7,336 --> 0:15:9,437
took my seat.


317
0:15:9,437 --> 0:15:11,738
And was still there.
He was watching it.


318
0:15:11,738 --> 0:15:13,439
And as I was
walking back off,


319
0:15:13,439 --> 0:15:16,14
he decided he was
going to chase it!


320
0:15:16,14 --> 0:15:17,841
And so he disengaged
the autopilot!


321
0:15:17,841 --> 0:15:19,66
When I get 
back off,


322
0:15:19,66 --> 0:15:20,756
I wanted to see how the 
passengers were doing.


323
0:15:20,756 --> 0:15:22,57
They were all on
the right hand side.


324
0:15:22,57 --> 0:15:23,858
they could see it
underneath the wing!


325
0:15:23,858 --> 0:15:25,159
And then I
thought, Oh hell!


326
0:15:25,159 --> 0:15:27,86
I recognized the
doctor back there


327
0:15:27,86 --> 0:15:29,261
He was a
psychiatrist


328
0:15:29,261 --> 0:15:31,362
out of the Thesdon
Naval hospital.


329
0:15:31,362 --> 0:15:32,463
Plus a lot of
other things.


330
0:15:32,463 --> 0:15:35,764
So I said, I had better
talk to him first.


331
0:15:35,764 --> 0:15:36,365
Carnet would say:


332
0:15:36,365 --> 0:15:38,166
Did you see what we
saw back there Doctor?


333
0:15:38,166 --> 0:15:40,67
And he grinned at me and
looked at me straight in the eyes,


334
0:15:40,67 --> 0:15:41,468
and he says, 
yeah that was


335
0:15:41,468 --> 0:15:42,969
a flying saucer!


336
0:15:42,969 --> 0:15:43,87
I didn't look 
at it!


337
0:15:43,87 --> 0:15:45,871
I don't believe
in such things!


338
0:15:45,871 --> 0:15:48,172
When I was
16 years old


339
0:15:48,172 --> 0:15:50,573
I was walking down the
street in Arlington, Virginia


340
0:15:50,573 --> 0:15:55,474
and saw 7 red light type
UFOs over Washington,


341
0:15:55,474 --> 0:15:58,175
that made headlines
around the world,


342
0:15:58,175 --> 0:16:1,76
and, since then,
I have seen


343
0:16:1,76 --> 0:16:4,677
8, alien vehicles
on 8 occasions.


344
0:16:4,677 --> 0:16:5,678
The sightings I've had,


345
0:16:5,678 --> 0:16:6,779
are more,


346
0:16:6,779 --> 0:16:8,28
things flying right by,


347
0:16:8,28 --> 0:16:10,781
or blueish green orb things!


348
0:16:10,781 --> 0:16:12,682
I've had 5 sightings.


349
0:16:12,682 --> 0:16:13,783
I've never reported them.


350
0:16:13,783 --> 0:16:15,884
Because I don't
need the grief.


351
0:16:15,884 --> 0:16:17,385
But the trick is,
you know


352
0:16:17,385 --> 0:16:18,786
you can't mention
the company name


353
0:16:18,786 --> 0:16:19,887
or be a company
uniform.


354
0:16:19,887 --> 0:16:21,388
Two of my friends,


355
0:16:21,388 --> 0:16:24,789
excellent pilots, one of
them was a famous pilot,


356
0:16:24,789 --> 0:16:26,19
and yet, they
both got fired


357
0:16:26,19 --> 0:16:27,391
for doing interviews
like this,


358
0:16:27,391 --> 0:16:28,792
but they were in uniform.


359
0:16:28,792 --> 0:16:29,993
Since I've been
a child


360
0:16:29,993 --> 0:16:32,194
I'm looking up
into the sky thinking,


361
0:16:32,194 --> 0:16:35,101
is there more than 
just us human beings,


362
0:16:35,101 --> 0:16:37,195
in this huge 
universe?


363
0:16:37,195 --> 0:16:40,296
Now I do believe there
is more life forms.


364
0:16:40,296 --> 0:16:41,697
Different life forms.


365
0:16:41,697 --> 0:16:43,298
And more 
dimensions


366
0:16:43,298 --> 0:16:45,99
than we 
can perceive.


367
0:16:45,99 --> 0:16:46,6
I've had several 
sightings.


368
0:16:46,6 --> 0:16:50,201
Probably, the 
closest sighting,


369
0:16:50,201 --> 0:16:51,702
would have been,


370
0:16:51,702 --> 0:16:53,503
back in 1974.


371
0:16:53,503 --> 0:16:55,604
I was 
driving back,


372
0:16:55,604 --> 0:16:57,1
between Ottawa
and Montreal,


373
0:16:57,1 --> 0:17:0,206
going towards 
Montreal.


374
0:17:0,206 --> 0:17:2,107
I remember going
on the highway,


375
0:17:2,107 --> 0:17:4,808
and we came
within, literally,


376
0:17:4,808 --> 0:17:7,26
probably, several
hundred feet


377
0:17:7,26 --> 0:17:9,288
of a huge, 
huge ship!


378
0:17:9,288 --> 0:17:10,889
And at first...


379
0:17:10,889 --> 0:17:12,69
you know, we were
driving away here,


380
0:17:12,69 --> 0:17:14,291
and I'm thinking,


381
0:17:14,291 --> 0:17:16,192
Am I really
seeing this?!?!


382
0:17:16,192 --> 0:17:18,93
And we slowed down.


383
0:17:18,93 --> 0:17:19,894
And sort of 
peeked out.


384
0:17:19,894 --> 0:17:21,795
and an enormous,
enormous ship,


385
0:17:21,795 --> 0:17:22,596
I would have 
to say,


386
0:17:22,596 --> 0:17:25,57
that it was 2 or
3 times the size


387
0:17:25,57 --> 0:17:27,458
of a 747!


388
0:17:27,458 --> 0:17:31,401
And it completely, silently
glided over, across the highway


389
0:17:31,401 --> 0:17:34,102
and we saw it go
off into the distance.


390
0:17:34,102 --> 0:17:35,25
So there was
no mistaking


391
0:17:35,25 --> 0:17:38,804
that that was not
anything at that time


392
0:17:38,804 --> 0:17:42,605
that would have existed
conventionally or militarily.


393
0:17:42,605 --> 0:17:45,306
I was a Lieutenant from
the Bulgarian Air force.


394
0:17:45,306 --> 0:17:47,45
My plane was
the MIG 21.


395
0:17:47,45 --> 0:17:48,585
What I believe?


396
0:17:48,585 --> 0:17:50,551
I believe there is
much more going on


397
0:17:50,551 --> 0:17:53,452
than we can see
with our naked eye.


398
0:17:53,452 --> 0:17:57,253
Being in the 3rd Battalion,
7th Marine regiment,


399
0:17:57,253 --> 0:17:59,421
we were pretty active, we
were on the East coast


400
0:17:59,421 --> 0:18:2,201
in an area called,
'The Punchbowl'.


401
0:18:2,201 --> 0:18:5,802
Which is just down the road
from Heartbreak Ridge.


402
0:18:5,802 --> 0:18:9,81
We had a lull in
the fighting, so,


403
0:18:9,81 --> 0:18:12,5
we just sat around
and played poker.


404
0:18:12,5 --> 0:18:13,75
And somebody
looked up and said,


405
0:18:13,75 --> 0:18:15,103
What the heck is that!?


406
0:18:15,103 --> 0:18:16,904
and we all looked up.


407
0:18:16,904 --> 0:18:19,801
and there was err, it look 
for all of the world,


408
0:18:19,801 --> 0:18:22,476
like a chrome 
hubcap,


409
0:18:22,476 --> 0:18:23,977
sitting up 
above us.


410
0:18:23,977 --> 0:18:25,678
And if you 
looked at it


411
0:18:25,678 --> 0:18:28,736
it kind of had a
watery, shimmery look


412
0:18:28,736 --> 0:18:33,491
and a little bit of a
blueish white periphery.


413
0:18:33,491 --> 0:18:36,492
And from time to time,
it would appear to be


414
0:18:36,492 --> 0:18:40,21
elliptical and
sometimes circular.


415
0:18:40,21 --> 0:18:45,336
So I imagine it was
rocking a little bit.


416
0:18:45,336 --> 0:18:47,441
There was just
a hint of a dome


417
0:18:47,441 --> 0:18:49,7
sometimes on it.


418
0:18:49,7 --> 0:18:51,143
Well we 
watched it,


419
0:18:51,143 --> 0:18:54,251
and our Colonel came 
out and took a look at it, 


420
0:18:54,251 --> 0:18:57,406
and he made 
a phone call.


421
0:18:57,406 --> 0:19:4,721
Pretty soon, 4 F86 D model, 
saber jets came out,


422
0:19:4,721 --> 0:19:8,1
and they tried to
get to the object,


423
0:19:8,1 --> 0:19:12,446
and it appeared that 
they hit some barrier,


424
0:19:12,446 --> 0:19:13,402
which you 
couldn't see,


425
0:19:13,402 --> 0:19:16,341
because they would
stall out and do a


426
0:19:16,341 --> 0:19:20,551
one and a half turn spin and
then pull out at the bottom.


427
0:19:20,551 --> 0:19:25,201
The flying saucer
finally decided to leave,


428
0:19:25,201 --> 0:19:27,802
and it got very, 
very bright.


429
0:19:27,802 --> 0:19:31,826
And it was pretty difficult
to look directly at it.


430
0:19:31,826 --> 0:19:36,211
But it rose straight up and
it went through the overcast.


431
0:19:36,211 --> 0:19:38,826
Now, when it went
through the overcast,


432
0:19:38,826 --> 0:19:45,186
there were three black rings that
radiated from the flange of the craft,


433
0:19:45,186 --> 0:19:47,787
and went from the
flange of the craft


434
0:19:47,787 --> 0:19:51,271
all the way over the horizon,
with no sound at all.


435
0:19:51,271 --> 0:19:52,351
And what it 
looked like was,


436
0:19:52,351 --> 0:19:55,7
somebody dropping a pebble 
into a glassy pool of water,


437
0:19:55,7 --> 0:19:57,854
and the rings were
spreading out.


438
0:19:57,854 --> 0:20:0,255
In January of 2005.


439
0:20:0,255 --> 0:20:6,996
5.24pm, I was driving south on
Interstate 25, south of Denver.


440
0:20:6,996 --> 0:20:9,193
and I see this 
black object,


441
0:20:9,193 --> 0:20:13,801
coming up the road,
above the road, in the sky.


442
0:20:13,801 --> 0:20:15,302
and I thought, that's
curious, what is that?


443
0:20:15,302 --> 0:20:16,841
As I get closer,
as we close,


444
0:20:16,841 --> 0:20:19,242
I see that it is a,


445
0:20:19,242 --> 0:20:20,543
solid


446
0:20:20,543 --> 0:20:21,544
object.


447
0:20:21,544 --> 0:20:24,101
I thought it might have been
Canadian geese, for a start,


448
0:20:24,101 --> 0:20:25,911
I thought it might have 
been a piece of plastic,


449
0:20:25,911 --> 0:20:28,111
blown up in the 
breeze, like a kite.


450
0:20:28,111 --> 0:20:30,212
But I could see it
was a solid object


451
0:20:30,212 --> 0:20:32,513
it was not affected by
breeze in anyway.


452
0:20:32,513 --> 0:20:35,76
It was flying on
a straight course.


453
0:20:35,76 --> 0:20:36,577
It looked black, it may
have been some color


454
0:20:36,577 --> 0:20:38,878
but because it was
silhouetted against the sky,


455
0:20:38,878 --> 0:20:40,379
it looked very dark.


456
0:20:40,379 --> 0:20:42,476
It looked like a plank.
It looked like a board.


457
0:20:42,476 --> 0:20:43,471
An oblong 
shape.


458
0:20:43,471 --> 0:20:44,871
It was 
bizarre!


459
0:20:44,871 --> 0:20:48,321
It had a couple of little bumps
on the leading edge, on one end,


460
0:20:48,321 --> 0:20:50,122
and I thought,
well if it's just junk,


461
0:20:50,122 --> 0:20:51,7
that would be 
random, perhaps,


462
0:20:51,7 --> 0:20:53,41
it certainly wouldn't 
be symmetrical,


463
0:20:53,41 --> 0:20:54,442
and I looked at the
other side, and sure enough


464
0:20:54,442 --> 0:20:58,91
it had the identical bumps on
the other side of the leading edge!


465
0:20:58,91 --> 0:21:2,392
So it was an
anomalous object,


466
0:21:2,392 --> 0:21:3,241
Could I identify it?


467
0:21:3,241 --> 0:21:5,571
Heck no! I couldn't 
relate to it!


468
0:21:5,571 --> 0:21:8,816
It had no sweepback, no
anhedral, no dihedral.


469
0:21:8,816 --> 0:21:11,417
It didnâ€™t have any
external power plants,


470
0:21:11,417 --> 0:21:14,836
no wings, no
tail empennage.


471
0:21:14,836 --> 0:21:18,196
flight control surfaces or


472
0:21:18,196 --> 0:21:20,497
probes.


473
0:21:20,497 --> 0:21:23,776
A search of the term
'Fastwalkers' on the internet,


474
0:21:23,776 --> 0:21:28,21
immediately reveals references
that 'Fastwalker' is a codename,


475
0:21:28,21 --> 0:21:32,522
used by various government
agencies to refer to UFOs or


476
0:21:32,522 --> 0:21:34,234
as they are 
sometimes called,


477
0:21:34,234 --> 0:21:38,526
Non Reference Targets.


478
0:21:38,526 --> 0:21:42,5
Craft that I recorded that
did the 180 degree turn


479
0:21:42,5 --> 0:21:45,316
down on this
portion of the screen.


480
0:21:45,316 --> 0:21:49,351
They're called 'Fastwalkers',
because of their speed.


481
0:21:49,351 --> 0:21:55,346
The whole episode took about
half a second to perform, or less!


482
0:21:55,346 --> 0:21:57,847
And we're
talking milliseconds!


483
0:21:57,847 --> 0:21:59,45
And that kind
of lets you know,


484
0:21:59,45 --> 0:22:1,493
that it's not an earth 
satellite that we're looking at,


485
0:22:1,493 --> 0:22:3,916
because it's 
moving so fast.


486
0:22:3,916 --> 0:22:6,17
Plus the fact,


487
0:22:6,17 --> 0:22:9,538
our satellites don't
change direction,


488
0:22:9,538 --> 0:22:13,951
180 degrees without changing
speed, or 90 degrees.


489
0:22:13,951 --> 0:22:16,91
And I have seen
many of the shadows


490
0:22:16,91 --> 0:22:20,401
go up and do a 90 degree,
right across the screen.


491
0:22:20,401 --> 0:22:23,251
Sometimes, you'll
see 3 or 4 objects


492
0:22:23,251 --> 0:22:25,401
in formation, looks
like formation flying,


493
0:22:25,401 --> 0:22:28,381
and one will branch off to the
left and one will go to the right.


494
0:22:28,381 --> 0:22:33,518
Somebody coined
the phrase, 'Fastwalker'.


495
0:22:33,518 --> 0:22:35,286
It's appropriate.


496
0:22:35,286 --> 0:22:39,201
The Fastwalkers are
these very rapid moving,


497
0:22:39,201 --> 0:22:44,787
electrogravidic and anti-gravity
discs and craft of various shapes.


498
0:22:44,787 --> 0:22:48,96
The N.S.A. actually for a
long time called these E.T.Vs,


499
0:22:48,96 --> 0:22:50,88
Extra-Terrestrial Vehicles,


500
0:22:50,88 --> 0:22:54,146
and from the military who
have tracked these objects,


501
0:22:54,146 --> 0:22:56,141
they've been called
Fastwalkers because,


502
0:22:56,141 --> 0:22:59,81
as apposed to 'Slowalkers',
which are satellites.


503
0:22:59,81 --> 0:23:1,701
Because they move
at enormous speeds,


504
0:23:1,701 --> 0:23:3,426
for example, they've been 
tracked at going 10's of


505
0:23:3,426 --> 0:23:5,806
thousands of miles per 
hour in the atmosphere


506
0:23:5,806 --> 0:23:8,371
and making a right hand turn
without decelerating.


507
0:23:8,371 --> 0:23:11,251
Well, you can't do that
with a conventional system.


508
0:23:11,251 --> 0:23:13,781
You have to correct
the gravity and mass inertia.


509
0:23:13,781 --> 0:23:15,176
and that's what
these things are doing.


510
0:23:15,176 --> 0:23:17,36
So these have
been tracked on,


511
0:23:17,36 --> 0:23:19,896
dedicated and classified
radar systems.


512
0:23:19,896 --> 0:23:22,431
Occasionally, people who 
are on an ordinary system,


513
0:23:22,431 --> 0:23:23,791
will pick 
them up.


514
0:23:23,791 --> 0:23:26,701
Today, the internet is 
literally alive with websites,


515
0:23:26,701 --> 0:23:28,701
that are filled with 
detailed reports,


516
0:23:28,701 --> 0:23:30,947
many of which, include 
convincing videos,


517
0:23:30,947 --> 0:23:34,602
and pictures of unknown 
crafts and alien like creatures.


518
0:23:34,602 --> 0:23:36,303
I live in Phoenix, 
Arizona.


519
0:23:36,303 --> 0:23:39,451
I am a sky watcher,
a UFO hunter.


520
0:23:39,451 --> 0:23:42,452
I have a website called
www.cnufos.com


521
0:23:42,452 --> 0:23:45,53
Iâ€™ve had an interest in
UFOs my whole life.


522
0:23:45,53 --> 0:23:48,261
But officially that started
on April 15th of 2004,


523
0:23:48,261 --> 0:23:51,386
when I walked my dog
in the middle of the night,


524
0:23:51,386 --> 0:23:53,987
looked up in the sky and
saw some strange lights.


525
0:23:53,987 --> 0:23:57,51
I've got over 200 UFO
video clips on my website.


526
0:23:57,51 --> 0:23:59,152
I'm more interested
in the day footage.


527
0:23:59,152 --> 0:24:1,953
Now, the day footage
is completely different


528
0:24:1,953 --> 0:24:3,926
because that's
harder to dismiss.


529
0:24:3,926 --> 0:24:5,845
You know, so I would have 
to say every other month,


530
0:24:5,845 --> 0:24:8,346
 it seems like I'm 
catching something.


531
0:24:8,346 --> 0:24:10,391
And I go out 
everyday.


532
0:24:10,391 --> 0:24:13,538
Pretty much, 6 days a week,
a couple of hours a day.


533
0:24:13,538 --> 0:24:16,39
You know, you add all those
hours up and that's allot of time.


534
0:24:16,39 --> 0:24:18,686
Just to catch one
thing for 20 seconds!


535
0:24:18,686 --> 0:24:21,617
But that's more than most
people see in a lifetime, so,


536
0:24:21,617 --> 0:24:23,87
I think that's
better than nothing.


537
0:24:23,87 --> 0:24:28,688
Well I'm involved in the
political resolution of the


538
0:24:28,688 --> 0:24:30,471
I prefer to 
call it,


539
0:24:30,471 --> 0:24:33,89
the Truth Embargo that
the government have imposed,


540
0:24:33,89 --> 0:24:37,6
on the facts regarding the
extraterrestrial presence.


541
0:24:37,6 --> 0:24:41,88
That presence has
been established, I think,


542
0:24:41,88 --> 0:24:42,704
many times over


543
0:24:42,704 --> 0:24:46,631
by the citizen science research that
has been going on since the 1940's.


544
0:24:46,631 --> 0:24:50,851
The government did studies, but
they were primarily for show.


545
0:24:50,851 --> 0:24:54,455
and the issue from a government
standpoint has been managed,


546
0:24:54,455 --> 0:24:56,386
very intensely,


547
0:24:56,386 --> 0:24:59,653
since 1947,
at minimum!


548
0:24:59,653 --> 0:25:1,549
Managed in a 
sense that,


549
0:25:1,549 --> 0:25:3,554
the government was
going to deal with it,


550
0:25:3,554 --> 0:25:6,255
but deal with it within the
national security structure,


551
0:25:6,255 --> 0:25:9,699
and never acknowledge that
there is anything to this.


552
0:25:9,699 --> 0:25:10,828
But in fact 
there is!


553
0:25:10,828 --> 0:25:14,51
We are being engaged as
a planet and as a species


554
0:25:14,51 --> 0:25:16,352
by other beings.


555
0:25:16,352 --> 0:25:18,353
Possibly multiple 
species!


556
0:25:18,353 --> 0:25:21,36
This has just been proven
beyond any doubt at all,


557
0:25:21,36 --> 0:25:24,346
by anyone who reads
the research who isn't


558
0:25:24,346 --> 0:25:27,15
compromised 
by being,


559
0:25:27,15 --> 0:25:28,758
either an 
idiot or,


560
0:25:28,758 --> 0:25:31,973
an employee of the government
management of the issue,


561
0:25:31,973 --> 0:25:33,504
can only arrive 
at one conclusion.


562
0:25:33,504 --> 0:25:35,586
The evidence is 
overwhelming.


563
0:25:35,586 --> 0:25:36,987
Videotape.


564
0:25:36,987 --> 0:25:37,988
Daylight discs.


565
0:25:37,988 --> 0:25:39,189
Night time discs.


566
0:25:39,189 --> 0:25:40,49
Photographs.


567
0:25:40,49 --> 0:25:43,516
Direct pilot sightings
by the thousands!


568
0:25:43,516 --> 0:25:45,436
Millions of sightings
around the world.


569
0:25:45,436 --> 0:25:48,823
There are testimonies from
direct government involvement,


570
0:25:48,823 --> 0:25:51,31
and of course, you've 
got an entire contactee


571
0:25:51,31 --> 0:25:52,701
body of evidence 
that is now,


572
0:25:52,701 --> 0:25:55,102
in the tens of
thousands of reports.


573
0:25:55,102 --> 0:25:56,875
Now, like 
never before,


574
0:25:56,875 --> 0:26:0,903
astounding events are transcending
national and geographical boundaries,


575
0:26:0,903 --> 0:26:4,101
currently happening
in Brazil and Mexico.


576
0:26:4,101 --> 0:26:6,17
Unprecedented 
UFO sightings,


577
0:26:6,17 --> 0:26:10,22
are sweeping the entire area
of south and central America.


578
0:26:10,22 --> 0:26:11,395
Does the key to 
understanding,


579
0:26:11,395 --> 0:26:12,615
UFOs and aliens,


580
0:26:12,615 --> 0:26:14,515
and their relationship
with each of us,


581
0:26:14,515 --> 0:26:16,451
laying being able 
to simply perceive


582
0:26:16,451 --> 0:26:18,341
what is in a 
higher spectrum?


583
0:26:18,341 --> 0:26:20,51
Like seeing the 
infrared range,


584
0:26:20,51 --> 0:26:22,141
or other dimensional 
frequencies?


585
0:26:22,141 --> 0:26:25,736
Images gathered from
infrared cameras in Mexico


586
0:26:25,736 --> 0:26:28,41
and special cameras 
used in Brazil


587
0:26:28,41 --> 0:26:30,936
seem to indicate that
the aliens and their crafts


588
0:26:30,936 --> 0:26:34,1
may in fact be 
all around us.


589
0:26:34,1 --> 0:26:37,711
Jaime Maussan is one of
Mexicoâ€™s foremost journalists.


590
0:26:37,711 --> 0:26:39,401
Internationally known 
and respected,


591
0:26:39,401 --> 0:26:42,278
for more than three 
decades of journalistic work,


592
0:26:42,278 --> 0:26:44,979
his investigations and
reporting in the UFO field


593
0:26:44,979 --> 0:26:48,626
have made him an icon to
UFO researchers, worldwide.


594
0:26:48,626 --> 0:26:50,875
Jaime's weekly network
television show,


595
0:26:50,875 --> 0:26:51,686
60 Minutes,


596
0:26:51,686 --> 0:26:54,316
in Mexico, reaches millions
of people each week,


597
0:26:54,316 --> 0:26:58,176
and regularly carries segments
on the subject of UFOs.


598
0:26:58,176 --> 0:27:3,45
This flap has been
recorded on video.


599
0:27:3,45 --> 0:27:6,956
It means that we
have evidence to prove


600
0:27:6,956 --> 0:27:9,493
that something is 
really happening,


601
0:27:9,493 --> 0:27:11,357
in the Mexican 
Republic.


602
0:27:11,357 --> 0:27:13,821
The video camera 
has become,


603
0:27:13,821 --> 0:27:16,376
the most important 
instrument,


604
0:27:16,376 --> 0:27:21,379
to really capture
this new reality.


605
0:27:21,379 --> 0:27:23,878
Even the 
Mexican Army, 


606
0:27:23,878 --> 0:27:26,32
the Air force
in Mexico,


607
0:27:26,32 --> 0:27:28,701
recorded UFOs.


608
0:27:28,701 --> 0:27:30,599
The video was 
given to me,


609
0:27:30,599 --> 0:27:32,645
and I released 
that to the world!


610
0:27:32,645 --> 0:27:34,445
In that case, 
that happened,


611
0:27:34,445 --> 0:27:39,36
on March the 
5th, 2004.


612
0:27:39,36 --> 0:27:41,691
The soldiers were able
to record something that


613
0:27:41,691 --> 0:27:44,99
they couldn't see
with their own eyes!


614
0:27:44,99 --> 0:27:45,0
and that's 
amazing!


615
0:27:45,0 --> 0:27:47,17
That was the 
first time,


616
0:27:47,17 --> 0:27:52,69
someone recorded
something, that


617
0:27:52,69 --> 0:27:58,991
they were
not able to see!


618
0:27:58,991 --> 0:28:1,592
With Jaime Maussan,
aboard a plane


619
0:28:1,592 --> 0:28:4,877
coming from San Antonio 
to Mexico City, flying,


620
0:28:4,877 --> 0:28:6,511
over a place 
called,


621
0:28:6,511 --> 0:28:8,312
San Luis 
Potosi'


622
0:28:8,312 --> 0:28:10,837
to film a UFO,
following the plane!


623
0:28:10,837 --> 0:28:12,901
It was the detected
by the radars


624
0:28:12,901 --> 0:28:14,2
and they have
everything on film.


625
0:28:14,2 --> 0:28:15,903
So, for us it 
is normal.


626
0:28:15,903 --> 0:28:17,804
Maybe because we
are searching for it.


627
0:28:17,804 --> 0:28:21,105
Maybe because we are trying
to look for this reality.


628
0:28:21,105 --> 0:28:22,406
Maybe they are 
following us!


629
0:28:22,406 --> 0:28:24,661
I don't know, but it 
happened to me,


630
0:28:24,661 --> 0:28:27,832
that at least 50 
times! Maybe more!


631
0:28:27,832 --> 0:28:31,685
There are objects that we
cannot see with our own eyes,


632
0:28:31,685 --> 0:28:32,152
but


633
0:28:32,152 --> 0:28:32,553
THEY


634
0:28:32,553 --> 0:28:32,954
ARE


635
0:28:32,954 --> 0:28:33,42
THERE


636
0:28:33,42 --> 0:28:35,56
They are 
watching us.


637
0:28:35,56 --> 0:28:37,611
In the last months,
in Mexico,


638
0:28:37,611 --> 0:28:40,212
after thousands 
of videos,


639
0:28:40,212 --> 0:28:44,936
we have been registering some
of the most spectacular videos.


640
0:28:44,936 --> 0:28:48,633
You can see hundreds
and hundreds of objects


641
0:28:48,633 --> 0:28:51,734
making formations,
and flying together


642
0:28:51,734 --> 0:28:56,8
exactly, the same 
thing that you can see,


643
0:28:56,8 --> 0:28:58,86
in the military 
video.


644
0:28:58,86 --> 0:29:1,501
These formations moving 
at the same speeds,


645
0:29:1,501 --> 0:29:5,802
in the same 
direction,


646
0:29:5,802 --> 0:29:13,401
at the same
altitude.


647
0:29:13,401 --> 0:29:16,719
As the more one researches,
the more one discovers,


648
0:29:16,719 --> 0:29:21,146
that literally 10's of thousands of
very credible people of every age,


649
0:29:21,146 --> 0:29:22,1
occupation,


650
0:29:22,1 --> 0:29:23,796
and nationality 
are claiming,


651
0:29:23,796 --> 0:29:26,1
that they have
had personal contact


652
0:29:26,1 --> 0:29:28,802
with either aliens, or
interdimensional beings.


653
0:29:28,802 --> 0:29:32,803
Credible researchers now say
that as many as 60 different species


654
0:29:32,803 --> 0:29:34,97
of intelligent, super 
conscious beings,


655
0:29:34,97 --> 0:29:38,681
have been interacting with
humanity for millions of years.


656
0:29:38,681 --> 0:29:41,782
Physically, they look,
they're humanoid.


657
0:29:41,782 --> 0:29:45,255
Their skin is as white
as a piece of paper.


658
0:29:45,255 --> 0:29:47,156
Throughout much
of their adult life


659
0:29:47,156 --> 0:29:49,729
they are the same
height that I am.


660
0:29:49,729 --> 0:29:51,93
5'11, 6 feet tall.


661
0:29:51,93 --> 0:29:55,412
Their eyes are perhaps
twice as large as ours.


662
0:29:55,412 --> 0:29:57,913
They're typically blue
eyes with white pupils.


663
0:29:57,913 --> 0:30:1,526
Although, when they get
older, especially the men,


664
0:30:1,526 --> 0:30:4,269
their eyes take
on a pink shade.


665
0:30:4,269 --> 0:30:9,481
Their eyes stretch further around the
sides of their head than human eyes do.


666
0:30:9,481 --> 0:30:12,43
And their ears 
and their nose,


667
0:30:12,43 --> 0:30:16,437
are only about half the size 
of human ears and noses,


668
0:30:16,437 --> 0:30:21,502
and their ears lay back along the side
of their head more than a human does.


669
0:30:21,502 --> 0:30:24,533
Their lips are not as
prominent as humans,


670
0:30:24,533 --> 0:30:28,18
and they don't have teeth,
they just have ridges,


671
0:30:28,18 --> 0:30:31,26
because they are plant
eaters, they don't eat meat.


672
0:30:31,26 --> 0:30:33,427
How can we know for sure,


673
0:30:33,427 --> 0:30:35,428
exactly how many 
extraterrestrial races


674
0:30:35,428 --> 0:30:38,558
are visiting us or 
interacting with humanity?


675
0:30:38,558 --> 0:30:41,0
There are 
different sources,


676
0:30:41,0 --> 0:30:43,16
disclosing some
of that information.


677
0:30:43,16 --> 0:30:45,558
I find one of the most credible
to be whistleblowers.


678
0:30:45,558 --> 0:30:50,7
People who have worked in
these various secret projects,


679
0:30:50,7 --> 0:30:52,588
who in some way
have kind of,


680
0:30:52,588 --> 0:30:54,661
been given information 
that gives them an idea,


681
0:30:54,661 --> 0:30:57,693
of exactly how
many races are here.


682
0:30:57,693 --> 0:31:0,41
One of those 
sources is a,


683
0:31:0,41 --> 0:31:4,669
Sergeant who worked in the, 
for 22 years in the Air force,


684
0:31:4,669 --> 0:31:6,27
Clifford Stone.


685
0:31:6,27 --> 0:31:10,66
And he was involved in
these top secret projects,


686
0:31:10,66 --> 0:31:13,698
that involve the
retrieval of crashed discs.


687
0:31:13,698 --> 0:31:18,214
And in that process he was able
to get quite a bit of information on


688
0:31:18,214 --> 0:31:20,599
how many extraterrestrial
races are visiting us.


689
0:31:20,599 --> 0:31:24,491
And he came up
with the figure of 57!


690
0:31:24,491 --> 0:31:27,96
Others have come
up with slightly more.


691
0:31:27,96 --> 0:31:31,456
Another prominent 
whistleblower,


692
0:31:31,456 --> 0:31:33,683
a former employee 
of the C.I.A.


693
0:31:33,683 --> 0:31:34,635
is John Lear.


694
0:31:34,635 --> 0:31:37,49
And he talks about, 
over 60 races,


695
0:31:37,49 --> 0:31:38,901
that are visiting 
the Earth.


696
0:31:38,901 --> 0:31:43,539
On one night I saw 
between 200 and 300,


697
0:31:43,539 --> 0:31:46,453
different tall,
white individuals,


698
0:31:46,453 --> 0:31:48,641
there were so many,
I couldn't count them!


699
0:31:48,641 --> 0:31:51,901
Lined up along the mountains 
to the east of the lawn,


700
0:31:51,901 --> 0:31:54,87
where the ammunition
bunker was.


701
0:31:54,87 --> 0:31:58,1
On the night that the tall
white lady known as Pamela


702
0:31:58,1 --> 0:32:1,847
was supposed to 
finish her final exam,


703
0:32:1,847 --> 0:32:5,551
to be head of the 
technology transfer team,


704
0:32:5,551 --> 0:32:7,352
to go into 
Livermore.


705
0:32:7,352 --> 0:32:10,551
In amongst those two or
three hundred tall whites,


706
0:32:10,551 --> 0:32:12,568
That's just an
estimate, because I,


707
0:32:12,568 --> 0:32:16,208
I couldn't, there was a crowd of
people and I couldn't count them all.


708
0:32:16,208 --> 0:32:21,101
There were also American 
Air force personnel,


709
0:32:21,101 --> 0:32:23,654
nobody below the 
rank of Colonel.


710
0:32:23,654 --> 0:32:26,1
There were others like 
a four star General.


711
0:32:26,1 --> 0:32:27,619
A three star 
General,


712
0:32:27,619 --> 0:32:29,2
There were
several of them.


713
0:32:29,2 --> 0:32:32,111
There were also several 
American government people,


714
0:32:32,111 --> 0:32:34,722
in civilian clothing 
over there.


715
0:32:34,722 --> 0:32:38,235
Could it be possible that our
universe is not only immense,


716
0:32:38,235 --> 0:32:39,966
but that it
is full of life,


717
0:32:39,966 --> 0:32:42,401
and that there is a great 
diversity of this life,


718
0:32:42,401 --> 0:32:44,501
spread throughout 
own own local galaxy,


719
0:32:44,501 --> 0:32:46,626
and even our
solar system.


720
0:32:46,626 --> 0:32:50,633
Equally outstanding is the recent
revelation by the government of Brazil,


721
0:32:50,633 --> 0:32:53,722
of their intent to turn
over the official UFO files,


722
0:32:53,722 --> 0:32:57,818
dating back to as early as
1954, to the people of Brazil.


723
0:32:57,818 --> 0:33:0,365
Well, the Varginha
case is probably the


724
0:33:0,365 --> 0:33:3,501
best well documented
case that we have in Brazil,


725
0:33:3,501 --> 0:33:5,422
and probably
in the world.


726
0:33:5,422 --> 0:33:10,486
You know that over 80
witnesses came forward,


727
0:33:10,486 --> 0:33:12,622
first hand witnesses
came forward,


728
0:33:12,622 --> 0:33:17,468
during the first weeks, and they
are still coming after it happened


729
0:33:17,468 --> 0:33:19,61
during all of these
years we still


730
0:33:19,61 --> 0:33:22,587
keep getting witnesses that
come forward and tell us


731
0:33:22,587 --> 0:33:28,638
pieces of the big story, that
we know already, in comprises,


732
0:33:28,638 --> 0:33:31,57
the capture of at least,


733
0:33:31,57 --> 0:33:32,959
two alien creatures


734
0:33:32,959 --> 0:33:34,46
in Aselo, Varginha.


735
0:33:34,46 --> 0:33:37,99
We know for a fact, because
we have it all documented,


736
0:33:37,99 --> 0:33:42,45
plus the witnesses have
confirmed and cross confirmed


737
0:33:42,45 --> 0:33:47,51
that one alien was captured
in the morning of that day


738
0:33:47,51 --> 0:33:48,452
which was a Saturday.


739
0:33:48,452 --> 0:33:49,953
About 10.30


740
0:33:49,953 --> 0:33:54,96
by a Fire Department and some
personnel from the Army.


741
0:33:54,96 --> 0:33:57,131
Another creature was
seen, on the same day


742
0:33:57,131 --> 0:34:0,58
by middle-afternoon,
by three girls.


743
0:34:0,58 --> 0:34:4,449
It was them who called
attention of all the city


744
0:34:4,449 --> 0:34:8,1
to the fact that, strange
creatures had been seen.


745
0:34:8,1 --> 0:34:11,733
Because when the first one was
seen and captured in the morning,


746
0:34:11,733 --> 0:34:13,934
it didn't draw
too much attention.


747
0:34:13,934 --> 0:34:18,359
but in the afternoon when
the girls saw another creature,


748
0:34:18,359 --> 0:34:21,1
and then, spread
the word to everybody,


749
0:34:21,1 --> 0:34:22,21
We saw the devil!


750
0:34:22,21 --> 0:34:23,696
That's what they
thought they saw.


751
0:34:23,696 --> 0:34:27,806
That night of the Saturday,
January 20th 1996


752
0:34:27,806 --> 0:34:31,101
that second creature, probably
the same one saw by the girls,


753
0:34:31,101 --> 0:34:38,764
was also captured. By a police car,
actually a military police car.


754
0:34:38,764 --> 0:34:41,531
with two policeman inside.


755
0:34:41,531 --> 0:34:45,93
The one who was sitting in the
passenger seat was Marco Eli Chereze,


756
0:34:45,93 --> 0:34:50,587
and he was lucky enough to be
the one, who spotted the creature


757
0:34:50,587 --> 0:34:54,661
and grabbed it with 
his bear hands,


758
0:34:54,661 --> 0:34:55,801
got back to 
the car,


759
0:34:55,801 --> 0:34:56,811
put the creature 
in his lap,


760
0:34:56,811 --> 0:34:58,412
and took it
to hospital.


761
0:34:58,412 --> 0:35:2,873
25 days after that, he
died, on February 15th,


762
0:35:2,873 --> 0:35:7,295
of some bacteria 
attacks,


763
0:35:7,295 --> 0:35:12,301
proving that his 
immune system,


764
0:35:12,301 --> 0:35:16,331
was absolutely 
destroyed.


765
0:35:16,331 --> 0:35:21,4
Army personnel and authorities
kept it all secret for lots of time,


766
0:35:21,4 --> 0:35:24,537
until the UFO researchers
started protesting,


767
0:35:24,537 --> 0:35:26,84
along with 
the press,


768
0:35:26,84 --> 0:35:28,49
and we gave so much 
pressure, that eventually, 


769
0:35:28,49 --> 0:35:29,944
information was 
released about it.


770
0:35:29,944 --> 0:35:33,201
The exobiological aspect that
the probability of life out there


771
0:35:33,201 --> 0:35:36,299
has actually increased
over what it was in 1950.


772
0:35:36,299 --> 0:35:40,211
and the err, indication
that there may be ways


773
0:35:40,211 --> 0:35:41,601
of traveling faster 
than the speed of light.


774
0:35:41,601 --> 0:35:44,693
So hey, they can get 
here from there!


775
0:35:44,693 --> 0:35:46,767
It doesn't mean that they
are coming in 5 minutes,


776
0:35:46,767 --> 0:35:49,393
or they're coming every
hour of everyday, but you know,


777
0:35:49,393 --> 0:35:51,501
they might be able to 
traverse just huge distances,


778
0:35:51,501 --> 0:35:53,251
in a period of weeks or 
months or something,


779
0:35:53,251 --> 0:35:55,642
instead of spending hundreds
or thousands of years.


780
0:35:55,642 --> 0:35:57,612
Well, look at
the UFO sightings.


781
0:35:57,612 --> 0:36:0,401
Maybe they provide the
answer that they are here!


782
0:36:0,401 --> 0:36:5,763
There was talk in the War Room,
about a study that was underway.


783
0:36:5,763 --> 0:36:9,829
And this study became
 initiated in 1961,


784
0:36:9,829 --> 0:36:12,251
as the result of an 
event that occurred,


785
0:36:12,251 --> 0:36:15,612
early February, 
in 1961.


786
0:36:15,612 --> 0:36:21,421
Where a flight of UFOs were flying
from the Soviet sector to the east,


787
0:36:21,421 --> 0:36:26,907
over the Warsaw pact, towards
the west, over the NATO lines.


788
0:36:26,907 --> 0:36:32,193
These, objects were very
high and were very fast.


789
0:36:32,193 --> 0:36:34,21
They were in formation.


790
0:36:34,21 --> 0:36:37,44
They appeared to
be circular in shape.


791
0:36:37,44 --> 0:36:41,812
And they were obviously
under intelligent control.


792
0:36:41,812 --> 0:36:45,531
They came in a formation 
of what appeared to be,


793
0:36:45,531 --> 0:36:48,596
almost 100 
of them.


794
0:36:48,596 --> 0:36:50,18
And they flew
 in formation,


795
0:36:50,18 --> 0:36:54,862
at a high rate of speed
from the east, over NATO


796
0:36:54,862 --> 0:37:0,105
over the channel, southern
coast of England, where they turned,


797
0:37:0,105 --> 0:37:5,591
flew north and disappeared from
NATO radar over the Norwegian sea.


798
0:37:5,591 --> 0:37:8,117
We found out that the
Soviets had gone on alert.


799
0:37:8,117 --> 0:37:12,701
The Warsaw pact had gone on alert
because they had picked them up.


800
0:37:12,701 --> 0:37:21,275
All of our Air force and radar
sensory devices picked them up.


801
0:37:21,275 --> 0:37:24,922
NATO thought those objects
belonged to the Russians.


802
0:37:24,922 --> 0:37:29,917
We found later that the Russians
thought they belonged to us.


803
0:37:29,917 --> 0:37:34,631
Both forces, were 
to find out later,


804
0:37:34,631 --> 0:37:37,851
that they didn't 
belong to any of us.


805
0:37:37,851 --> 0:37:40,757
That they belonged
to somebody else!


806
0:37:40,757 --> 0:37:42,201
And of course, the
BIG question is:


807
0:37:42,201 --> 0:37:43,767
Who the hell do
they belong to?


808
0:37:43,767 --> 0:37:45,669
Who are they? What are they?


809
0:37:45,669 --> 0:37:47,601
Where are they from?


810
0:37:47,601 --> 0:37:52,176
They demonstrated
incredibly high technology.


811
0:37:52,176 --> 0:37:53,999
They were not jets.


812
0:37:53,999 --> 0:37:56,503
There were no contrails.


813
0:37:56,503 --> 0:37:59,651
They were circular,
they were metallic.


814
0:37:59,651 --> 0:38:1,276
They were in formation.


815
0:38:1,276 --> 0:38:5,401
They moved, obviously,
under intelligent control.


816
0:38:5,401 --> 0:38:7,201
NATO - SHAPE.


817
0:38:7,201 --> 0:38:9,842
Supreme Headquarters 
Allied Powers,


818
0:38:9,842 --> 0:38:13,421
initiated a study 
in 1961,


819
0:38:13,421 --> 0:38:17,68
which was underway
when I arrived in 1963.


820
0:38:17,68 --> 0:38:19,301
To determine what the
hell these things were!


821
0:38:19,301 --> 0:38:22,297
Some experts now claim,
that societies exist


822
0:38:22,297 --> 0:38:27,82
in our universe, at every conceivable
level of social and spiritual development.


823
0:38:27,82 --> 0:38:30,786
Societies and civilizations
that express themselves


824
0:38:30,786 --> 0:38:35,175
in countless manners of
physical forms and spiritual ways.


825
0:38:35,175 --> 0:38:40,279
Have great wars and conflicts
occurred within our own Solar System?


826
0:38:40,279 --> 0:38:43,272
Does our true planetary
past include rebellions


827
0:38:43,272 --> 0:38:46,558
and disputes that have raged
throughout our heavens?


828
0:38:46,558 --> 0:38:48,159
In our distant past,


829
0:38:48,159 --> 0:38:52,177
have massive spacecrafts rained
destruction down from the heavens?


830
0:38:52,177 --> 0:38:56,741
Ravishing continents and
destroying advanced civilizations?


831
0:38:56,741 --> 0:38:59,27
GENESIS 6:1


832
0:38:59,27 --> 0:39:2,17
When men began to increase
in number on the Earth,


833
0:39:2,17 --> 0:39:3,894
and daughters were
born to them,


834
0:39:3,894 --> 0:39:6,901
the sons of God saw that the
daughters of men were beautiful,


835
0:39:6,901 --> 0:39:9,65
and they married any
of them they chose.


836
0:39:9,65 --> 0:39:11,976
The historical
record is plain!


837
0:39:11,976 --> 0:39:16,555
This has been a phenomenon that has
been around since our recorded history.


838
0:39:16,555 --> 0:39:20,601
The Vedas, the Hindu Vedas, which are
among the oldest writings in the world,


839
0:39:20,601 --> 0:39:22,698
talk about the flying Vimana's,


840
0:39:22,698 --> 0:39:27,651
and how that they were used to launch
weapons, and blow up cities and


841
0:39:27,651 --> 0:39:29,64
all this stuff,
you know,


842
0:39:29,64 --> 0:39:34,739
Again, we've got Ezekiel, and it
just goes all the way back.


843
0:39:34,739 --> 0:39:36,261
So they've been
here all along.


844
0:39:36,261 --> 0:39:40,851
If their game plan was like an
Independence Day type invasion,


845
0:39:40,851 --> 0:39:44,697
where they were going to blow up
everything and eat everybody or whatever,


846
0:39:44,697 --> 0:39:46,751
It would have happened,
long before now!


847
0:39:46,751 --> 0:39:49,951
My main question was:
Is God out there too?


848
0:39:49,951 --> 0:39:52,1
If God is on this planet,
is he out there too?


849
0:39:52,1 --> 0:39:54,485
and those questions were
answered by reading the bible.


850
0:39:54,485 --> 0:39:56,666
And that really set
me on this journey,


851
0:39:56,666 --> 0:39:58,781
to understanding the
abduction phenomenon.


852
0:39:58,781 --> 0:40:2,202
What is the
reasoning for this?


853
0:40:2,202 --> 0:40:3,751
Who is doing this?


854
0:40:3,751 --> 0:40:5,451
And all those questions
that we all ask.


855
0:40:5,451 --> 0:40:8,925
We think of aliens and
we think of angels as,


856
0:40:8,925 --> 0:40:11,976
you know, divine beings,
that we have no idea of,


857
0:40:11,976 --> 0:40:15,211
and we don't see and we don't
communicate with on a daily basis.


858
0:40:15,211 --> 0:40:18,45
But it is not only the
bible and other holy works


859
0:40:18,45 --> 0:40:22,653
that are filled with references
to UFOs and extraterrestrials.


860
0:40:22,653 --> 0:40:26,35
Drawings, paintings, stone
carvings and even coins,


861
0:40:26,35 --> 0:40:30,933
reflect strange humanoid like
creatures and their flying crafts.


862
0:40:30,933 --> 0:40:33,601
Serious researchers now
say that the real question


863
0:40:33,601 --> 0:40:36,48
is not whether there
are abductions occurring,


864
0:40:36,48 --> 0:40:39,391
but are the abductions
to help, or to harm us?


865
0:40:39,391 --> 0:40:44,202
And they Greys were authorized
to, sort of like a Noah's Ark,


866
0:40:44,202 --> 0:40:49,1
to develop a full
genetic and DNA bank


867
0:40:49,1 --> 0:40:52,1
of all flora and fauna
on this planet, so as to


868
0:40:52,1 --> 0:40:57,1
replant it, centuries down the
road, after the catastrophe.


869
0:40:57,1 --> 0:41:1,43
Can you imagine,
any President,


870
0:41:1,43 --> 0:41:7,442
whether it be Bush or Clinton or whatever,
standing before the public, and saying, yes,


871
0:41:7,442 --> 0:41:12,41
I am aware that we have this
joint program with some aliens,


872
0:41:12,41 --> 0:41:14,775
to upgrade our
biological computers.


873
0:41:14,775 --> 0:41:20,38
To build better bodies to house
our souls in future incarnations.


874
0:41:20,38 --> 0:41:22,608
You can't talk
about things like that!


875
0:41:22,608 --> 0:41:25,8
He wouldn't be able to do the
job that we hired him to do.


876
0:41:25,8 --> 0:41:29,644
What we know of the
reptilians by a number of


877
0:41:29,644 --> 0:41:33,797
abductees, contactees and
also whistleblowers is that


878
0:41:33,797 --> 0:41:35,698
there seems to be


879
0:41:35,698 --> 0:41:39,923
allot of evidence supporting
the existence of this race of beings,


880
0:41:39,923 --> 0:41:41,701
on the planet for
thousands of years.


881
0:41:41,701 --> 0:41:46,601
In other words that we might consider
them to be an indigenous Earth species


882
0:41:46,601 --> 0:41:51,905
an advanced, non-human species, that has
lived on the Earth for thousands of years,


883
0:41:51,905 --> 0:41:54,981
and actually may have
played quite an important role,


884
0:41:54,981 --> 0:41:58,751
in the genetic manipulation
or engineering,


885
0:41:58,751 --> 0:42:2,155
which supposedly has happened
when it comes to humanity.


886
0:42:2,155 --> 0:42:6,592
There are various groups,
individuals, species,


887
0:42:6,592 --> 0:42:10,49
who from time to time, come and
visit this planet, and ZOOP around,


888
0:42:10,49 --> 0:42:17,327
and I think that to try to ascribe any
one particular motive to them is err,


889
0:42:17,327 --> 0:42:24,28
tantamount to us looking up at the air
at a Boeing 767 aircraft and saying:


890
0:42:24,28 --> 0:42:26,697
Are those people
good or bad?


891
0:42:26,697 --> 0:42:28,651
You know, you
just can't ask that.


892
0:42:28,651 --> 0:42:32,263
It's just, it's a group of people,
a group of intelligent beings


893
0:42:32,263 --> 0:42:35,246
some of them are good, some
of them are not so good.


894
0:42:35,246 --> 0:42:40,9
But I will say this, I don't think there is
any reason for great fear and anxiety.


895
0:42:40,9 --> 0:42:46,825
Most recently, two new terms have emerged
that also describe human/alien interaction.


896
0:42:46,825 --> 0:42:49,858
The most widely used
is the word Experiencer,


897
0:42:49,858 --> 0:42:54,351
for those who have had some
sort of experience, good or bad.


898
0:42:54,351 --> 0:43:0,286
and Participator, which has been coined to explain
the cases where the individual may have been


899
0:43:0,286 --> 0:43:4,451
an abductee originally but has
transcended the situation by now,


900
0:43:4,451 --> 0:43:8,44
volunteering to participate
with his abductors.


901
0:43:8,44 --> 0:43:12,201
My contact with extraterrestrial
intelligence occurred,


902
0:43:12,201 --> 0:43:16,601
when I was aboard my sailing boat
in Hawaii, in the Honolulu harbor.


903
0:43:16,601 --> 0:43:21,1
and it was early one morning, it was
about 5am and I had gotten up early,


904
0:43:21,1 --> 0:43:24,72
and I had gotten a cup of coffee
and I had gone back to my bunk


905
0:43:24,72 --> 0:43:26,81
and I was just laying
there completely dressed,


906
0:43:26,81 --> 0:43:32,157
trying to err, just look at the beautiful
sunrise that was occurring through the


907
0:43:32,157 --> 0:43:34,147
large skylight above my bed,


908
0:43:34,147 --> 0:43:38,751
and then suddenly, the most
incredible energy enveloped me,


909
0:43:38,751 --> 0:43:43,636
and the whole room began to, like
glow and glisten and a beautiful woman


910
0:43:43,636 --> 0:43:46,265
materialized right
next to my bed!


911
0:43:46,265 --> 0:43:50,97
And at first I thought I was
dreaming or hallucinating,


912
0:43:50,97 --> 0:43:53,92
and I said, you can't be real!
And she said, well I am!


913
0:43:53,92 --> 0:43:57,351
and I said, well why are
you here? And she said,


914
0:43:57,351 --> 0:44:4,555
I'm here as a representative of a group of
friends that want you to come to a briefing.


915
0:44:4,555 --> 0:44:8,8
The room was lit up completely,
but my eyes were closed.


916
0:44:8,8 --> 0:44:12,1
I knew somehow, not
to open my eyes!


917
0:44:12,1 --> 0:44:13,666
There was something telling me:


918
0:44:13,666 --> 0:44:18,627
Don't open your eyes because you
won't like what you're going to see!


919
0:44:18,627 --> 0:44:22,725
Eventually, I did open my eyes,
because I could hear noise in the room,


920
0:44:22,725 --> 0:44:26,446
there was like a scuffling on,
the floor, I opened my eyes,


921
0:44:26,446 --> 0:44:32,375
there were three, small,
grey beings with big black eyes


922
0:44:32,375 --> 0:44:37,292
and big heads, and very
skinny, spindly limbs,


923
0:44:37,292 --> 0:44:41,406
They pulled me up
out of the bed,


924
0:44:41,406 --> 0:44:47,1
and then with one behind me and
one each side of me holding my elbows,


925
0:44:47,1 --> 0:44:49,653
walked me
towards the window.


926
0:44:49,653 --> 0:44:52,11
And I'm thinking, well the
windows are closed guys,


927
0:44:52,11 --> 0:44:54,77
so you had better open
them before we go any further!


928
0:44:54,77 --> 0:44:59,935
So there was this rationality and
irrationality going on at the same time.


929
0:44:59,935 --> 0:45:3,283
I boarded what could
be called a saucer.


930
0:45:3,283 --> 0:45:6,612
It was some type of an
interdimensional vehicle,


931
0:45:6,612 --> 0:45:9,686
that took me to the
briefing that was occurring


932
0:45:9,686 --> 0:45:12,901
on a planet, a local planet
here in our system,


933
0:45:12,901 --> 0:45:14,202
it was Jupiter.


934
0:45:14,202 --> 0:45:17,853
And the whole planet just
radiated with the energy.


935
0:45:17,853 --> 0:45:23,239
And I spent time there with
these incredible people, or beings,


936
0:45:23,239 --> 0:45:29,1
and I got a glimpse of mankindâ€™s
destiny or future, as it was possible.


937
0:45:29,1 --> 0:45:33,0
And as we approached the
window, I closed my eyes.


938
0:45:33,0 --> 0:45:37,214
And as I did, I
felt this stickiness.


939
0:45:37,214 --> 0:45:41,28
It was like, it was a
stickiness and a feeling


940
0:45:41,28 --> 0:45:44,1
of something being pulled
very slowly across my face.


941
0:45:44,1 --> 0:45:47,916
It wasn't painful, it was
just very, very weird!


942
0:45:47,916 --> 0:45:53,187
The next, I opened my eyes, because
I felt cold, I felt wind on my face,


943
0:45:53,187 --> 0:45:59,736
and I was aware that I was now floating,
outside of the window, 3 stories up


944
0:45:59,736 --> 0:46:4,27
looking down at the car park, with
a very bright light above my head.


945
0:46:4,27 --> 0:46:6,1
I couldn't really see
what was above my head,


946
0:46:6,1 --> 0:46:8,734
I was just aware of
this very bright light.


947
0:46:8,734 --> 0:46:12,653
One little grey on each
elbow, I was aware of them,


948
0:46:12,653 --> 0:46:15,781
and we floated
up into the craft!


949
0:46:15,781 --> 0:46:18,415
And people have said: Well,
then you were abducted!


950
0:46:18,415 --> 0:46:21,146
And I said, no, I
went very willingly.


951
0:46:21,146 --> 0:46:22,931
And they've also asked,


952
0:46:22,931 --> 0:46:26,101
how can you tell if you were
to meet an extraterrestrial?


953
0:46:26,101 --> 0:46:28,936
And I would have to
say, the energy field.


954
0:46:28,936 --> 0:46:31,194
Because, when they're
in your presence,


955
0:46:31,194 --> 0:46:36,707
they absolutely resonate at a
frequency that is so much higher.


956
0:46:36,707 --> 0:46:41,886
It can only be described as dealing
with them could be described as ecstasy!


957
0:46:41,886 --> 0:46:47,924
I had been taken in the middle
of the night, while I was asleep,


958
0:46:47,924 --> 0:46:51,101
I was asleep through the whole
thing until all of a sudden,


959
0:46:51,101 --> 0:46:55,263
I felt some pressure
going up my nose,


960
0:46:55,263 --> 0:47:0,265
and it startled me so much,
that I opened my eyes.


961
0:47:0,265 --> 0:47:4,951
And when I opened my eyes,
I saw this large headed being,


962
0:47:4,951 --> 0:47:12,98
with grey skin, large black eyes,
and small other features,


963
0:47:12,98 --> 0:47:15,801
that was looking
down at me.


964
0:47:15,801 --> 0:47:20,823
He had long fingers that he was
using to hold this instrument,


965
0:47:20,823 --> 0:47:24,475
that he was using to
shove up my nose!


966
0:47:24,475 --> 0:47:27,417
I feel knowledge is power.


967
0:47:27,417 --> 0:47:29,532
And some day,


968
0:47:29,532 --> 0:47:31,89
maybe next week,


969
0:47:31,89 --> 0:47:32,996
maybe tomorrow,


970
0:47:32,996 --> 0:47:34,557
maybe in 5 years from now,


971
0:47:34,557 --> 0:47:39,125
we're going to get all of the proof
we need that somebody exists.


972
0:47:39,125 --> 0:47:42,697
Hey an E.T. might show up and
I might actually get an interview!


973
0:47:42,697 --> 0:47:46,805
The point is, that the more that
we know about this subject,


974
0:47:46,805 --> 0:47:49,602
then the less legend
can take over.


975
0:47:49,602 --> 0:47:53,43
If you see a craft hanging near you,


976
0:47:53,43 --> 0:47:56,49
don't get out of the
car, don't stop the car.


977
0:47:56,49 --> 0:47:58,686
Don't see what's happening.


978
0:47:58,686 --> 0:48:1,43
If you see one
coming towards you,


979
0:48:1,43 --> 0:48:4,651
you don't have to be an
abductee, if you don't want to be!


980
0:48:4,651 --> 0:48:6,579
They go away, evidently.


981
0:48:6,579 --> 0:48:9,201
We have 10's and 10's
of people telling us:


982
0:48:9,201 --> 0:48:13,431
Listen, I don't want to do that
anymore, and they let them go.


983
0:48:13,431 --> 0:48:18,17
What we call abductions, or
certain categories of abductions,


984
0:48:18,17 --> 0:48:25,2
took place as a result of an authorized
genetic upgrade of the human race.


985
0:48:25,2 --> 0:48:27,892
trying to get us out
of our war-like ways,


986
0:48:27,892 --> 0:48:31,101
and act-illogically
ecocidal ways.


987
0:48:31,101 --> 0:48:34,364
The indigenous
reptilians seem to


988
0:48:34,364 --> 0:48:38,491
have a very strong interest
in the biosphere of Earth being


989
0:48:38,491 --> 0:48:42,99
stable, that it's not
jeopardized unduly,


990
0:48:42,99 --> 0:48:45,0
and some who
have kind of,


991
0:48:45,0 --> 0:48:48,971
analyzed what the reptilians have been
doing, or had some kind of interaction,


992
0:48:48,971 --> 0:48:53,279
believe that this is because, the
reptilians view humanity as a resource,


993
0:48:53,279 --> 0:48:57,375
and they don't want that resource to
damage itself, or damage the biosphere.


994
0:48:57,375 --> 0:48:59,851
They had about 18
scientists and all had been


995
0:48:59,851 --> 0:49:2,332
working on various
stages of the project,


996
0:49:2,332 --> 0:49:6,176
gathered around a big oval table
in Los Alamos Headquarters,


997
0:49:6,176 --> 0:49:10,752
with Edward Teller, the head of
the Atomic Energy Commission,


998
0:49:10,752 --> 0:49:12,839
sitting at the
head of the table,


999
0:49:12,839 --> 0:49:17,423
One of the aliens, on the opposite side of
the table from my engineering friend,


1000
0:49:17,423 --> 0:49:20,693
put in a white shirt and slacks
so he would look less alien,


1001
0:49:20,693 --> 0:49:25,365
but he still had his alien, bigger
head and bigger eyes, black eyes,


1002
0:49:25,365 --> 0:49:28,476
and he was sitting
in the conference,


1003
0:49:28,476 --> 0:49:31,202
he could understand everybody
else because he was telepathic,


1004
0:49:31,202 --> 0:49:33,151
and the only way he
could communicate though,


1005
0:49:33,151 --> 0:49:36,101
was with the signs that he had
developed with my engineer friend,


1006
0:49:36,101 --> 0:49:37,501
to answer the question.


1007
0:49:37,501 --> 0:49:40,51
But here was a man, an
alien from another planet,


1008
0:49:40,51 --> 0:49:43,29
sitting in a
conference, in 1968


1009
0:49:43,29 --> 0:49:45,146
in Los Alamos Headquarters,


1010
0:49:45,146 --> 0:49:47,801
on the progress of learning
how to bridge the gap,


1011
0:49:47,801 --> 0:49:49,701
between the alien
technology and ours.


1012
0:49:49,701 --> 0:49:52,587
They were going to suggest
to the American generals,


1013
0:49:52,587 --> 0:49:55,764
additional technology
exchange projects,


1014
0:49:55,764 --> 0:49:58,806
and I think they were using
me as the test guinea-pig,


1015
0:49:58,806 --> 0:50:1,116
to take me onboard
the scout craft,


1016
0:50:1,116 --> 0:50:3,121
and then they could
test my reaction,


1017
0:50:3,121 --> 0:50:5,531
to what I was impressed with
and what I wasn't with.


1018
0:50:5,531 --> 0:50:9,163
My life changed and I was
never, ever quite the same.


1019
0:50:9,163 --> 0:50:14,4
So, the study itself, was not as
complete as it could have been.


1020
0:50:14,4 --> 0:50:15,951
They concluded what
they wanted to conclude.


1021
0:50:15,951 --> 0:50:18,801
1: There was not
a threat involved.


1022
0:50:18,801 --> 0:50:21,683
2: They werenâ€™t
the Soviets.


1023
0:50:21,683 --> 0:50:25,842
3: The evidence was overwhelming,
they were extraterrestrial.


1024
0:50:25,842 --> 0:50:30,527
4: There were four
groups involved.


1025
0:50:30,527 --> 0:50:32,922
Four different groups.


1026
0:50:32,922 --> 0:50:35,393
And they were
all humanoid.


1027
0:50:35,393 --> 0:50:37,379
But they were
not human.


1028
0:50:37,379 --> 0:50:42,16
Only one of the four was what
we consider to be human.


1029
0:50:42,16 --> 0:50:46,458
One group out of the four
looked so much like us,


1030
0:50:46,458 --> 0:50:49,101
I mean, almost
identical to us,


1031
0:50:49,101 --> 0:50:53,793
these guys could have
put on a suit and a tie!


1032
0:50:53,793 --> 0:50:54,604
The females,


1033
0:50:54,604 --> 0:50:58,676
because we encountered
some of them as well.


1034
0:50:58,676 --> 0:51:2,847
They could have put on a
dress, suit and tie, coat or jacket,


1035
0:51:2,847 --> 0:51:5,301
sit down with you, next
to you in a restaurant,


1036
0:51:5,301 --> 0:51:7,976
sit next to you
in a theatre,


1037
0:51:7,976 --> 0:51:9,963
and you'd never know!


1038
0:51:9,963 --> 0:51:19,457
These extraterrestrials, they
have a body like ours.


1039
0:51:19,457 --> 0:51:30,21
and these extraterrestrial vehicles,


1040
0:51:30,21 --> 0:51:52,591
Iâ€™m using this in a large sense,
or the people inside the craft -


1041
0:51:52,591 --> 0:51:53,466
It's very difficult,


1042
0:51:53,466 --> 0:52:0,7
because they make themselves
seen and known to people on Earth,


1043
0:52:0,7 --> 0:52:4,591
so it's probably logical that
they are inside a craft,


1044
0:52:4,591 --> 0:52:23,4
instead of coming from
somewhere else without a craft.


1045
0:52:23,4 --> 0:52:29,561
They will have to have
a soul like we do.


1046
0:52:29,561 --> 0:52:32,819
They'd have to have
some kind of body,


1047
0:52:32,819 --> 0:52:42,6
otherwise they
would be angels.


1048
0:52:42,6 --> 0:52:46,826
How can countries, one of which
actually borders with the United States,


1049
0:52:46,826 --> 0:52:49,845
be having UFO visitations
by the hundreds,


1050
0:52:49,845 --> 0:52:54,363
when other major nations of
our world insist, that they are not?


1051
0:52:54,363 --> 0:52:56,35
And even more
importantly,


1052
0:52:56,35 --> 0:52:58,701
how can these countries'
governmental policy,


1053
0:52:58,701 --> 0:53:1,611
both official and
otherwise be,


1054
0:53:1,611 --> 0:53:5,48
that they never have
had UFO or alien contact?


1055
0:53:5,48 --> 0:53:7,666
The only logical
explanation,


1056
0:53:7,666 --> 0:53:10,368
is in fact that governments
are willing to lie.


1057
0:53:10,368 --> 0:53:13,246
For the past 9 years I have
been researching into the,


1058
0:53:13,246 --> 0:53:15,1
United States government files,


1059
0:53:15,1 --> 0:53:16,975
on what they have on
the UFO phenomenon,


1060
0:53:16,975 --> 0:53:19,1
and all sorts of
different conspiracies.


1061
0:53:19,1 --> 0:53:22,151
And I've reached
183'000 pages,


1062
0:53:22,151 --> 0:53:24,201
of government documents
on the internet!


1063
0:53:24,201 --> 0:53:25,651
There is a political block,


1064
0:53:25,651 --> 0:53:27,301
what I call a
'Truth Embargo',


1065
0:53:27,301 --> 0:53:28,915
instituted by
the government,


1066
0:53:28,915 --> 0:53:32,171
that they are not ready
to formally acknowledge,


1067
0:53:32,171 --> 0:53:33,721
this "presence".


1068
0:53:33,721 --> 0:53:35,501
Anything that involved
absolute proof,


1069
0:53:35,501 --> 0:53:36,601
like hardware and bodies,


1070
0:53:36,601 --> 0:53:39,21
were siphoned off completely
into another track.


1071
0:53:39,21 --> 0:53:41,843
They just can't allow information
to come out overnight,


1072
0:53:41,843 --> 0:53:43,701
so people would
be perturbed


1073
0:53:43,701 --> 0:53:46,486
and actually demand that
something be done about it.


1074
0:53:46,486 --> 0:53:51,1
They stonewall it, deny it,
lie about it, for, you know,


1075
0:53:51,1 --> 0:53:52,211
30 or 40 years,


1076
0:53:52,211 --> 0:53:55,301
and then finally just announce it
as if it's fact and everybody goes,


1077
0:53:55,301 --> 0:53:56,461
yeah, OK!


1078
0:53:56,461 --> 0:53:59,22
It's clear we're dealing
with a cosmic 'Watergate'.


1079
0:53:59,22 --> 0:54:1,5
Meaning, some few people
within major governments,


1080
0:54:1,5 --> 0:54:4,28
have known since
at least July 1947,


1081
0:54:4,28 --> 0:54:8,282
when two crashed flying saucers and several
alien bodies were recovered in New Mexico,


1082
0:54:8,282 --> 0:54:11,831
that indeed, some
UFOs are alien spacecraft.


1083
0:54:11,831 --> 0:54:16,752
The government setup
Project Bluebook, the Air force did,


1084
0:54:16,752 --> 0:54:20,554
in order to investigate
this subject on a,


1085
0:54:20,554 --> 0:54:21,806
let me say,
a low level.


1086
0:54:21,806 --> 0:54:23,87
Researchers,


1087
0:54:23,87 --> 0:54:26,43
mostly, regular citizens,


1088
0:54:26,43 --> 0:54:28,751
have proven without a doubt
there's an extraterrestrial presence


1089
0:54:28,751 --> 0:54:31,496
and we're being engaged,
the evidence is overwhelming.


1090
0:54:31,496 --> 0:54:34,851
In some cases, you can actually
point to where the Air force explanation


1091
0:54:34,851 --> 0:54:36,447
completely contradicts,


1092
0:54:36,447 --> 0:54:39,741
whatâ€™s inside the
sighting report itself.


1093
0:54:39,741 --> 0:54:42,629
The word UFO is actually
a disinformation term,


1094
0:54:42,629 --> 0:54:45,101
that was invented after they
knew that they werenâ€™t unidentified,


1095
0:54:45,101 --> 0:54:47,102
and they knew
they didn't fly!


1096
0:54:47,102 --> 0:54:50,303
So it's sort of a,
mind play.


1097
0:54:50,303 --> 0:54:55,768
When we had first
evidence of E.T. visitation,


1098
0:54:55,768 --> 0:55:0,116
and hardware and so on,
and so on came along,


1099
0:55:0,116 --> 0:55:1,607
the U.S. government
took the attitude,


1100
0:55:1,607 --> 0:55:3,431
that they couldn't
release this


1101
0:55:3,431 --> 0:55:8,501
to the general public, because it had
extreme implications for defense.


1102
0:55:8,501 --> 0:55:11,1
We don't want our enemies
to know that we've got one,


1103
0:55:11,1 --> 0:55:12,591
because then they
might try to get one.


1104
0:55:12,591 --> 0:55:15,986
To the extent that we might be able
to back-engineer the technology,


1105
0:55:15,986 --> 0:55:17,782
we don't want to err,


1106
0:55:17,782 --> 0:55:20,376
tell somebody else that we're
trying to do such a thing.


1107
0:55:20,376 --> 0:55:24,502
Gus Grissom, who was probably
the person that I was closest to,


1108
0:55:24,502 --> 0:55:26,423
felt that they
were Spam in a can,


1109
0:55:26,423 --> 0:55:29,305
and that the Astronauts were
just a public relations campaign,


1110
0:55:29,305 --> 0:55:33,311
for a secret military program
that was spending much more.


1111
0:55:33,311 --> 0:55:35,301
The military space program was getting,


1112
0:55:35,301 --> 0:55:37,4
you know, was
a gleaming jewel,


1113
0:55:37,4 --> 0:55:39,686
compared to the junk that
N.A.S.A. was getting at the time.


1114
0:55:39,686 --> 0:55:42,681
You can get a certain amount of
information out through the large media,


1115
0:55:42,681 --> 0:55:44,633
but it's very superficial
and very brief,


1116
0:55:44,633 --> 0:55:45,731
that's what we've found.


1117
0:55:45,731 --> 0:55:49,314
The in-depth sort of, disclosure
of what's really going on,


1118
0:55:49,314 --> 0:55:52,153
who's behind it,
what the agenda is,


1119
0:55:52,153 --> 0:55:53,936
that is almost
always stopped,


1120
0:55:53,936 --> 0:55:55,37
or if they try to do it,


1121
0:55:55,37 --> 0:55:57,585
it gets turned into
something ridiculous.


1122
0:55:57,585 --> 0:55:59,936
I almost hate the
term UFOs because,


1123
0:55:59,936 --> 0:56:2,389
they really aren't
unidentified to


1124
0:56:2,389 --> 0:56:8,361
the people that know what's
going on, or the researchers too.


1125
0:56:8,361 --> 0:56:11,78
allot of people that
have the answers,


1126
0:56:11,78 --> 0:56:12,696
felt it was safe to
come out of the water,


1127
0:56:12,696 --> 0:56:16,226
so they're putting out their
information on the internet,


1128
0:56:16,226 --> 0:56:18,321
and, you know,
disguised or whatever,


1129
0:56:18,321 --> 0:56:22,246
but, so these other
agents who say they're


1130
0:56:22,246 --> 0:56:24,523
scanning all the time to
counteract what's


1131
0:56:24,523 --> 0:56:28,844
being said by other people from
Intel to think it was safe to OK,


1132
0:56:28,844 --> 0:56:32,256
they can put this out, or they feel
like it's the right thing to do now.


1133
0:56:32,256 --> 0:56:33,351
You know, enough is enough.


1134
0:56:33,351 --> 0:56:35,401
Mankind has a right
to know type of thing.


1135
0:56:35,401 --> 0:56:39,823
When I worked for Douglas, I was
assigned to the Douglas Skyrocket.


1136
0:56:39,823 --> 0:56:43,771
They wanted me to wire up a
camera out on the wing tip


1137
0:56:43,771 --> 0:56:47,638
to look through a course
window, back at the canopy.


1138
0:56:47,638 --> 0:56:52,824
So that they could monitor the
pilot, to see what he was doing.


1139
0:56:52,824 --> 0:56:57,82
While I went through the
hanger, which was secured.


1140
0:56:57,82 --> 0:57:0,401
Well, there were two gentlemen in
there, and they introduced themselves.


1141
0:57:0,401 --> 0:57:4,991
One was Naval Intelligence,
and the other one was C.I.A.


1142
0:57:4,991 --> 0:57:10,506
And I started working, doing
my job, wiring up the camera.


1143
0:57:10,506 --> 0:57:13,726
Well they sat around and talked
and it became very apparent to me,


1144
0:57:13,726 --> 0:57:16,198
that they were there
for that purpose, to talk!


1145
0:57:16,198 --> 0:57:20,101
They knew about all my
flying saucer experiences,


1146
0:57:20,101 --> 0:57:21,681
all the way from Korea!


1147
0:57:21,681 --> 0:57:25,843
They told me, Intelligence,
the C.I.A. Intelligence group,


1148
0:57:25,843 --> 0:57:29,196
had three intelligence digests.


1149
0:57:29,196 --> 0:57:31,305
Flying saucer photographs,


1150
0:57:31,305 --> 0:57:32,921
and witness documentation,


1151
0:57:32,921 --> 0:57:34,851
from all over
the world!


1152
0:57:34,851 --> 0:57:39,401
And they said that I should probably
try to get those three copies,


1153
0:57:39,401 --> 0:57:43,506
and that's when I
wrote to Admiral Freeman,


1154
0:57:43,506 --> 0:57:49,591
and wasn't able to get
the documents, incidentally.


1155
0:57:49,591 --> 0:57:51,262
In addition to that,


1156
0:57:51,262 --> 0:57:54,985
they told me
that I should,


1157
0:57:54,985 --> 0:58:0,722
tell people about what
my experiences have been.


1158
0:58:0,722 --> 0:58:4,15
They said tell
everybody you can!


1159
0:58:4,15 --> 0:58:6,136
Because they can't!


1160
0:58:6,136 --> 0:58:8,404
They were not
aloud to talk about it.


1161
0:58:8,404 --> 0:58:11,788
There is this curtain of ridicule
that's been drawn up around the,


1162
0:58:11,788 --> 0:58:13,531
UFO phenomenon,


1163
0:58:13,531 --> 0:58:17,531
and as long as that curtain
of ridicule holds solid,


1164
0:58:17,531 --> 0:58:20,372
the scientists
will be afraid to


1165
0:58:20,372 --> 0:58:26,142
contribute to anything,
to looking into UFOs.


1166
0:58:26,142 --> 0:58:29,832
And part of that curtain of
ridicule involves the fact that,


1167
0:58:29,832 --> 0:58:35,126
hardly any decent papers have gotten
into the refereed, scientific literature.


1168
0:58:35,126 --> 0:58:40,562
So that curtain of ridicule may be
slightly opened up now that they have a


1169
0:58:40,562 --> 0:58:46,459
paper that they can refer to if they feel
like writing their own papers on UFOs.


1170
0:58:46,459 --> 0:58:51,1
The secrecy has invaded, like
a cancer, many institutions,


1171
0:58:51,1 --> 0:58:53,968
including the media, the
government and corporations.


1172
0:58:53,968 --> 0:58:58,1
I got into more and more
controversial and exotic subjects,


1173
0:58:58,1 --> 0:59:1,59
and I found myself a
journalist without a journal!


1174
0:59:1,59 --> 0:59:3,351
There is definitely
very tight control,


1175
0:59:3,351 --> 0:59:5,783
over the flow of information
of certain topics,


1176
0:59:5,783 --> 0:59:8,884
through our corporate
controlled mass media.


1177
0:59:8,884 --> 0:59:14,107
They seem to take it upon themselves
to be the gatekeepers of information.


1178
0:59:14,107 --> 0:59:17,543
Part of this information that
they are keeping from us,


1179
0:59:17,543 --> 0:59:20,901
is the just absolutely
immense wealth of


1180
0:59:20,901 --> 0:59:24,22
information, concerning
the UFO phenomenon,


1181
0:59:24,22 --> 0:59:26,946
and the fact that it can
be tracked and documented,


1182
0:59:26,946 --> 0:59:29,1
all the way back
through history.


1183
0:59:29,1 --> 0:59:32,146
The only institution
that is more corrupt,


1184
0:59:32,146 --> 0:59:34,281
than what I'm
describing as this rogue,


1185
0:59:34,281 --> 0:59:36,468
transnational, cleptocracy,


1186
0:59:36,468 --> 0:59:39,68
is the major media.


1187
0:59:39,68 --> 0:59:42,5
More worse than the congress,
worse than the Whitehouse,


1188
0:59:42,5 --> 0:59:45,906
worse than anything at the normal
level of clearances at the Pentagon,


1189
0:59:45,906 --> 0:59:47,89
is big media.


1190
0:59:47,89 --> 0:59:50,55
Big media does not report
the truth about these things,


1191
0:59:50,55 --> 0:59:51,981
because they
are not free to.


1192
0:59:51,981 --> 0:59:54,401
And we think in the United
States and in the western world,


1193
0:59:54,401 --> 0:59:55,925
we really have
a free press,


1194
0:59:55,925 --> 0:59:58,372
we have a free press on
everything that's non-important,


1195
0:59:58,372 --> 1:0:1,44
on the really important
issues, it's very controlled,


1196
1:0:1,44 --> 1:0:2,811
and this is the most
important issue.


1197
1:0:2,811 --> 1:0:5,401
This is the biggest secret in
the history of the human race.


1198
1:0:5,401 --> 1:0:8,573
The known modern
history of government.


1199
1:0:8,573 --> 1:0:11,891
And they have co-operated
with keeping the secret.


1200
1:0:11,891 --> 1:0:15,1
How is this
cover-up contained,


1201
1:0:15,1 --> 1:0:19,124
and maintained through
international borders,


1202
1:0:19,124 --> 1:0:22,429
and if it is, are their
motivations the same?


1203
1:0:22,429 --> 1:0:25,701
The best guess
is that,


1204
1:0:25,701 --> 1:0:31,934
since America has such
overwhelming economic power,


1205
1:0:31,934 --> 1:0:35,101
the only worse thing than
America being mad at you,


1206
1:0:35,101 --> 1:0:37,401
is for America
to ignore you.


1207
1:0:37,401 --> 1:0:43,74
So many countries economies
depend on America, that I think


1208
1:0:43,74 --> 1:0:46,871
that they take their orders
from America in some ways.


1209
1:0:46,871 --> 1:0:48,211
When it comes to
the cover-up,


1210
1:0:48,211 --> 1:0:49,381
I think that's
one of them.


1211
1:0:49,381 --> 1:0:54,0
The U.S. government is not only
pressuring the Brazilian government,


1212
1:0:54,0 --> 1:0:56,153
but it's making pressure


1213
1:0:56,153 --> 1:0:58,801
over almost all countries


1214
1:0:58,801 --> 1:1:2,901
that are some how aligned politically,
aligned to the United States.


1215
1:1:2,901 --> 1:1:8,75
Now, all south America, except
maybe for Chile and Venezuela,


1216
1:1:8,75 --> 1:1:10,899
who has Chavez,
who is a rebel!


1217
1:1:10,899 --> 1:1:17,505
All the rest of Latin America,
is very aligned to U.S. politics.


1218
1:1:17,505 --> 1:1:20,682
So, all these countries,
will do just exactly,


1219
1:1:20,682 --> 1:1:23,926
what the U.S.
President tells them,


1220
1:1:23,926 --> 1:1:26,882
it is, keep this
under wraps!


1221
1:1:26,882 --> 1:1:31,315
Recent media polls show that over 100
million people in the United States alone,


1222
1:1:31,315 --> 1:1:34,773
believe that there is some
form of extraterrestrial life.


1223
1:1:34,773 --> 1:1:39,387
45% believe that the Earth has been
visited by extraterrestrial beings.


1224
1:1:39,387 --> 1:1:43,711
Nationally known journalists continue to
turn a deaf ear to the publicâ€™s demands


1225
1:1:43,711 --> 1:1:48,139
for true investigative
reporting on a daily basis.


1226
1:1:48,139 --> 1:1:53,281
Accepting instead, the dribble of denial
from numerous government agencies as fact,


1227
1:1:53,281 --> 1:1:56,101
while refusing to interview
the legions of researchers,


1228
1:1:56,101 --> 1:1:58,501
who have made serious
scientific investigation,


1229
1:1:58,501 --> 1:2:3,998
of UFOs and alien
contact, their life's work.


1230
1:2:3,998 --> 1:2:8,385
What else are the governments
of the world, not saying?


1231
1:2:8,385 --> 1:2:13,26
What if there is positive proof
that UFOs do in fact exist?


1232
1:2:13,26 --> 1:2:16,1
What if that proof has
existed for years, but


1233
1:2:16,1 --> 1:2:21,44
has been hidden neatly within the fabric
of a system of lies and grand deception?


1234
1:2:21,44 --> 1:2:24,675
We need to be very concerned
about the way in which this whole


1235
1:2:24,675 --> 1:2:28,63
area has been managed by the
national security agencies responsible.


1236
1:2:28,63 --> 1:2:32,956
By maintaining secrecy, keeping
people in the dark, it means that


1237
1:2:32,956 --> 1:2:37,281
we really don't know
whether this secrecy, and


1238
1:2:37,281 --> 1:2:38,601
withholding the information,


1239
1:2:38,601 --> 1:2:40,102
withholding the technologies,


1240
1:2:40,102 --> 1:2:41,98
from the general
public arena,


1241
1:2:41,98 --> 1:2:44,671
is really for the best
interest of all of us.


1242
1:2:44,671 --> 1:2:47,734
The problem has been
since the early 1950's,


1243
1:2:47,734 --> 1:2:51,199
and err, I have the
government documents!


1244
1:2:51,199 --> 1:2:54,266
The United States government
has instituted a policy


1245
1:2:54,266 --> 1:2:58,791
of denial and control
over the information.


1246
1:2:58,791 --> 1:3:0,6
Nothing happening
there folks!


1247
1:3:0,6 --> 1:3:2,331
Nothing happening
there folks!


1248
1:3:2,331 --> 1:3:5,496
And if somebody persists
in saying, but I saw it!


1249
1:3:5,496 --> 1:3:6,844
Then they
are ridiculed.


1250
1:3:6,844 --> 1:3:9,501
You got a screw loose,
somethingâ€™s not right with him!


1251
1:3:9,501 --> 1:3:12,391
This is absolutely
just unconscionable,


1252
1:3:12,391 --> 1:3:18,53
in a country that pays lip service
to freedom and individual liberty.


1253
1:3:18,53 --> 1:3:20,1
Because there have
been so many people,


1254
1:3:20,1 --> 1:3:22,151
whose lives have
been wrecked,


1255
1:3:22,151 --> 1:3:24,291
whose families have
been wrecked,


1256
1:3:24,291 --> 1:3:27,846
because of this policy
of denial and ridicule,


1257
1:3:27,846 --> 1:3:31,501
over a phenomenon that has
happened worldwide for centuries!


1258
1:3:31,501 --> 1:3:35,109
Disclosure has a very
defined definition. It means,


1259
1:3:35,109 --> 1:3:38,351
the formal acknowledgement
by the governments of the world,


1260
1:3:38,351 --> 1:3:39,933
of the extraterrestrial presence.


1261
1:3:39,933 --> 1:3:44,471
As fellow inhabitants of planet Earth,
we live in a rapidly changing world.


1262
1:3:44,471 --> 1:3:47,811
The advent of modern communication
networks and the internet,


1263
1:3:47,811 --> 1:3:49,965
has made maintaining
the UFO cover-up,


1264
1:3:49,965 --> 1:3:53,208
a difficult and demanding
undertaking.


1265
1:3:53,208 --> 1:4:0,229
Brian Vike of HBCC UFO, has the number
1 UFO website to send information to.


1266
1:4:0,229 --> 1:4:4,239
Him and Rense
and UFOCasebook,


1267
1:4:4,239 --> 1:4:7,151
are the three places that I always
send my footage to because,


1268
1:4:7,151 --> 1:4:10,151
they will only put verified
sightings on their site,


1269
1:4:10,151 --> 1:4:12,169
they just won't
put junk up there.


1270
1:4:12,169 --> 1:4:16,951
And I know they get over 3 or
4, up to 10 million hits a month!


1271
1:4:16,951 --> 1:4:19,524
For over half a century,
the United States,


1272
1:4:19,524 --> 1:4:22,249
Great Britain and a
host of aligned countries,


1273
1:4:22,249 --> 1:4:25,1
have been able to maintain
a vast web of secrecy


1274
1:4:25,1 --> 1:4:27,151
over what is actually
happening worldwide,


1275
1:4:27,151 --> 1:4:30,75
relative to aliens, or what
are generally known as E.B.Es.


1276
1:4:30,75 --> 1:4:33,551
Extraterrestrial Biological Entities.


1277
1:4:33,551 --> 1:4:35,45
But that is rapidly changing,


1278
1:4:35,45 --> 1:4:36,433
and disclosure,


1279
1:4:36,433 --> 1:4:38,421
the lifting of the
truth embargo,


1280
1:4:38,421 --> 1:4:40,967
is now taking place.


1281
1:4:40,967 --> 1:4:43,842
I'll be getting over
500'000 hits this month.


1282
1:4:43,842 --> 1:4:46,438
But the interesting
thing about that is,


1283
1:4:46,438 --> 1:4:49,756
that a couple of thousand of those
hits each month, are from the military.


1284
1:4:49,756 --> 1:4:53,372
As far as sharing information on the
internet, that is the best way to do it,


1285
1:4:53,372 --> 1:4:55,513
and probably
the safest way.


1286
1:4:55,513 --> 1:4:59,749
Only because, I know I've sent DVDs to
people and they haven't received them.


1287
1:4:59,749 --> 1:5:3,501
And I would email them and say,
look, I'm going to send you a DVD,


1288
1:5:3,501 --> 1:5:6,439
can you analyze it for me, and let
me know what you think this is?


1289
1:5:6,439 --> 1:5:9,821
2 weeks later, they'll email me
and say, well I never got it!


1290
1:5:9,821 --> 1:5:12,384
I'm just waiting for that day, when
they come knocking on my door


1291
1:5:12,384 --> 1:5:16,635
and want to talk to me about it,
but uh, until that day, I think,


1292
1:5:16,635 --> 1:5:19,801
I think they know who I am, I
think they know we're here. I think,


1293
1:5:19,801 --> 1:5:22,365
this is the way it's going to
be done from here on out.


1294
1:5:22,365 --> 1:5:24,301
Because the military
definitely doesn't want


1295
1:5:24,301 --> 1:5:26,1
to talk about it anymore!


1296
1:5:26,1 --> 1:5:28,653
Everything at night to them
is a flare or an airplane.


1297
1:5:28,653 --> 1:5:32,885
On the contrary, we have all this
evidence that shows otherwise.


1298
1:5:32,885 --> 1:5:38,0
Like a dawning of a new day, the internet
is quickly sweeping away the darkness.


1299
1:5:38,0 --> 1:5:46,864
The truth will not be stopped.


1300
1:5:46,864 --> 1:5:49,486
We're in this
strange reality,


1301
1:5:49,486 --> 1:5:51,1
which we're caught
between two worlds,


1302
1:5:51,1 --> 1:5:53,573
between 2 paradigms.


1303
1:5:53,573 --> 1:5:55,197
And the bridge between,


1304
1:5:55,197 --> 1:5:58,45
or the door between these two
paradigms is what is now called,


1305
1:5:58,45 --> 1:6:1,102
'The Disclosure Event'.


1306
1:6:1,102 --> 1:6:2,851
Recently in
Washington D.C.,


1307
1:6:2,851 --> 1:6:7,2
a press conference was held in
conjunction with an international event,


1308
1:6:7,2 --> 1:6:8,821
The X-Conference


1309
1:6:8,821 --> 1:6:12,936
Where a panel of eminent scientists
and researchers broke the silence,


1310
1:6:12,936 --> 1:6:16,816
and spoke out and called for
a full international disclosure


1311
1:6:16,816 --> 1:6:21,865
and an end to the truth embargo
relative to UFOs and extraterrestrials.


1312
1:6:21,865 --> 1:6:28,727
If I was an 'in-the-know' person,
high up in government or finance,


1313
1:6:28,727 --> 1:6:30,401
and I knew about the
extraterrestrial issue,


1314
1:6:30,401 --> 1:6:32,801
and I knew about some
extraterrestrial technology,


1315
1:6:32,801 --> 1:6:35,585
and I knew what it could
do when it was released,


1316
1:6:35,585 --> 1:6:37,802
my position would be this:


1317
1:6:37,802 --> 1:6:42,384
Let's keep that technology
under wraps as long as possible,


1318
1:6:42,384 --> 1:6:46,127
while we sell as much of
the rest of the oil as we can,


1319
1:6:46,127 --> 1:6:48,376
for as much as possible.


1320
1:6:48,376 --> 1:6:50,459
And then we'll all
take that money,


1321
1:6:50,459 --> 1:6:53,803
and we'll use that to own
the extraterrestrial technology.


1322
1:6:53,803 --> 1:6:54,651
Alright.


1323
1:6:54,651 --> 1:6:58,946
The point is. There's always people
'in-the-know', and 'out-of-the-know'.


1324
1:6:58,946 --> 1:7:2,374
Sometimes it's about stuff, you
know, you're in or you're out.


1325
1:7:2,374 --> 1:7:6,976
But there are some things you can't have,
the 'in-the-know' and 'out-of-the-know'.


1326
1:7:6,976 --> 1:7:10,334
Basically, what we're
calling on today,


1327
1:7:10,334 --> 1:7:13,71
is for the government
of the United States,


1328
1:7:13,71 --> 1:7:18,96
to take the issue of
extraterrestrial life,


1329
1:7:18,96 --> 1:7:21,986
where it has been
stuck in conflict,


1330
1:7:21,986 --> 1:7:28,456
for the last 60 years, and take it out
of the military intelligence agencies,


1331
1:7:28,456 --> 1:7:31,89
and put it into the
department of education,


1332
1:7:31,89 --> 1:7:35,401
and the scientific departments,
where it belongs.


1333
1:7:35,401 --> 1:7:38,901
Take it out of the
threat scenario agencies,


1334
1:7:38,901 --> 1:7:42,325
where it is funded as
a potential threat,


1335
1:7:42,325 --> 1:7:47,346
and put it into the opportunity
agencies, where it is funded as


1336
1:7:47,346 --> 1:7:54,101
a matter of education and advancement
of knowledge, for mutual benefit.


1337
1:7:54,101 --> 1:7:57,936
There is an overwhelming
mass of proven,


1338
1:7:57,936 --> 1:7:58,501
real,


1339
1:7:58,501 --> 1:8:1,856
government documents,
that have been released


1340
1:8:1,856 --> 1:8:4,514
largely, through the
Freedom of Information Act,


1341
1:8:4,514 --> 1:8:8,821
that show decades
of, for example,


1342
1:8:8,821 --> 1:8:11,17
airspace violations.


1343
1:8:11,17 --> 1:8:12,923
Very sensitive
places by objects,


1344
1:8:12,923 --> 1:8:16,1
doing what appear
to be, the impossible.


1345
1:8:16,1 --> 1:8:18,163
We have these documents
from the 1940's.


1346
1:8:18,163 --> 1:8:19,364
We have them
from the 1950's.


1347
1:8:19,364 --> 1:8:23,367
We have them from the
1960's, 70's, 80's and beyond.


1348
1:8:23,367 --> 1:8:25,426
So these airspace
violations continue.


1349
1:8:25,426 --> 1:8:26,827
They are provocative.


1350
1:8:26,827 --> 1:8:30,197
They are at times,
seemingly confrontational.


1351
1:8:30,197 --> 1:8:32,101
You have pilots who
have been going,


1352
1:8:32,101 --> 1:8:34,22
who have been charged
with going up to get these things,


1353
1:8:34,22 --> 1:8:36,956
and they have described
them at times, saying, yes-


1354
1:8:36,956 --> 1:8:41,876
it appears to be a metallic
disc shape, there it goes!


1355
1:8:41,876 --> 1:8:47,608
I began on this topic by trying to do reverse
engineering on gravity control devices in 1968,


1356
1:8:47,608 --> 1:8:52,672
but now I'm officially looking
at leaked question documents.


1357
1:8:52,672 --> 1:8:55,495
Some of the documents
tell an amazing story.


1358
1:8:55,495 --> 1:8:58,942
One of the leaked
documents started with F.D.R.


1359
1:8:58,942 --> 1:9:2,355
and F.D.R. had setup,
through Vannevar Bush,


1360
1:9:2,355 --> 1:9:5,748
the committee called the non-terrestrial
science and engineering committee.


1361
1:9:5,748 --> 1:9:10,552
These were the guys, after the recovery
of a crashed flying saucer in 1942,


1362
1:9:10,552 --> 1:9:15,303
who were given the parts and were
told to figure out how they worked.


1363
1:9:15,303 --> 1:9:19,575
They came back to F.D.R. in
1944, and asked for money.


1364
1:9:19,575 --> 1:9:23,741
And he said: No, we got to win
the war first and beat the Nazis.


1365
1:9:23,741 --> 1:9:28,22
And then in 1947, it was
Vannevar Bush who went to


1366
1:9:28,22 --> 1:9:31,79
President Truman, who didn't
know about all of this, and said,


1367
1:9:31,79 --> 1:9:35,34
by the way, we have these craft, we could
do some reverse engineering in order to


1368
1:9:35,34 --> 1:9:39,97
improve our country, to improve our
culture, to improve our standard of living,


1369
1:9:39,97 --> 1:9:41,251
and that was when
the money started to flow.


1370
1:9:41,251 --> 1:9:46,136
July 2002, right here in
the Washington D.C. area,


1371
1:9:46,136 --> 1:9:50,301
there was, yet again,
an airspace, jet chase.


1372
1:9:50,301 --> 1:9:52,686
By 2 F-16 jet interceptors,


1373
1:9:52,686 --> 1:9:59,257
which were chasing, a 'blue-ish'
object, right outside D.C.


1374
1:9:59,257 --> 1:10:2,993
My opinion right now is, the person
who is going to wait for hard evidence,


1375
1:10:2,993 --> 1:10:12,116
is going to be left behind
when the delouse comes.


1376
1:10:12,116 --> 1:10:16,521
Exopolitics offers a
bridge out of:


1377
1:10:16,521 --> 1:10:18,192
The permanent warfare state.


1378
1:10:18,192 --> 1:10:21,25
The permanent warfare economy.


1379
1:10:21,25 --> 1:10:24,6
Out of the permanent
warfare industry,


1380
1:10:24,6 --> 1:10:27,101
into transforming the
permanent warfare industry,


1381
1:10:27,101 --> 1:10:32,261
into a co-operative
peaceful space age society,


1382
1:10:32,261 --> 1:10:35,1
integrated with
universal society.


1383
1:10:35,1 --> 1:10:39,1
So I began to look outside of
the, kind of, conventional sphere,


1384
1:10:39,1 --> 1:10:40,851
I began to explore theories,


1385
1:10:40,851 --> 1:10:44,821
for what it is that really is
driving international politics.


1386
1:10:44,821 --> 1:10:49,294
And so then I came up with
this area of an undisclosed,


1387
1:10:49,294 --> 1:10:52,521
extraterrestrial presence that
is kept from the general public.


1388
1:10:52,521 --> 1:10:55,92
So that really did help me
understand what was going on,


1389
1:10:55,92 --> 1:10:58,865
and what is driving
international politics.


1390
1:10:58,865 --> 1:11:4,101
What's important is the
structural blinders,


1391
1:11:4,101 --> 1:11:7,801
and the structural
belief patterns,


1392
1:11:7,801 --> 1:11:10,116
and the structural
paradigm,


1393
1:11:10,116 --> 1:11:15,842
if the Exopolitics
model can come in,


1394
1:11:15,842 --> 1:11:19,341
and establish itself as
the dominant paradigm,


1395
1:11:19,341 --> 1:11:23,265
such that, structurally,
within Academia,


1396
1:11:23,265 --> 1:11:26,151
the Earth is no
longer flat!


1397
1:11:26,151 --> 1:11:28,551
It is now round!


1398
1:11:28,551 --> 1:11:32,727
Intelligent life no longer ends
at the geostationing orbit,


1399
1:11:32,727 --> 1:11:36,545
the universe is now,
highly populated.


1400
1:11:36,545 --> 1:11:40,682
It's that sort of sea
change that we need,


1401
1:11:40,682 --> 1:11:44,951
to unleash the huge
public investment,


1402
1:11:44,951 --> 1:11:50,1
and private explosion of
creativity and co-operation,


1403
1:11:50,1 --> 1:11:55,176
to turn our spaceship around,
to be able to survive,


1404
1:11:55,176 --> 1:11:58,389
the environmental
pressures,


1405
1:11:58,389 --> 1:12:2,501
that are coming now,
which have been the result


1406
1:12:2,501 --> 1:12:13,62
of the embargo that
we have been under.


1407
1:12:13,62 --> 1:12:17,556
Are we, the people of Earth, on the
verge of technological destruction?


1408
1:12:17,556 --> 1:12:20,307
Has our use and
testing of nuclear weapons,


1409
1:12:20,307 --> 1:12:23,229
already triggered an inter
dimensional countdown,


1410
1:12:23,229 --> 1:12:25,101
that is now
moving us as a planet,


1411
1:12:25,101 --> 1:12:28,76
towards some kind of
interstellar intervention?


1412
1:12:28,76 --> 1:12:31,551
Even though there's clearly no
evidence, I want to emphasize this,


1413
1:12:31,551 --> 1:12:35,471
that these extraterrestrial
civilizations are hostile towards us,


1414
1:12:35,471 --> 1:12:38,101
I think they're very
worried about our hostility.


1415
1:12:38,101 --> 1:12:39,102
I always turn
this on it's head.


1416
1:12:39,102 --> 1:12:40,201
Because most of
these sort of,


1417
1:12:40,201 --> 1:12:43,151
documentaries, you know, always
like alien invasion and all this stuff,


1418
1:12:43,151 --> 1:12:44,552
No, no, no, no, no, no!


1419
1:12:44,552 --> 1:12:48,122
The issue is, if they were
hostile, we would know it by now.


1420
1:12:48,122 --> 1:12:51,346
It's clear to me, that what's going
on is that they're very concerned


1421
1:12:51,346 --> 1:12:57,6
that at the time that humanity
reached the ability to go into space,


1422
1:12:57,6 --> 1:13:1,451
early space exploration, the 1950's,
we also had already developed


1423
1:13:1,451 --> 1:13:2,781
weapons of mass destruction


1424
1:13:2,781 --> 1:13:5,699
and thermal nuclear
hydrogen bombs and stuff.


1425
1:13:5,699 --> 1:13:9,424
And that the co-incidence of that,
the coming together of those 2 things,


1426
1:13:9,424 --> 1:13:11,251
put a big red
flag over Earth!


1427
1:13:11,251 --> 1:13:15,513
And so, if you look at the databases
from the 50's, 60's, 70's, on forward,


1428
1:13:15,513 --> 1:13:17,901
not only in the United States,
but in Great Britain,


1429
1:13:17,901 --> 1:13:20,917
in the Soviet Union,
and in China,


1430
1:13:20,917 --> 1:13:25,227
that wherever we had space,
aerospace and nuclear facilities,


1431
1:13:25,227 --> 1:13:28,301
there were allot of these
so called, UFOs, being seen.


1432
1:13:28,301 --> 1:13:30,72
These groups, that
are interested in us,


1433
1:13:30,72 --> 1:13:33,958
at least seem to show
some benevolence,


1434
1:13:33,958 --> 1:13:36,567
I think, would probably
step in and keep us


1435
1:13:36,567 --> 1:13:40,156
from blowing the hell out of
ourselves, if push comes to shove.


1436
1:13:40,156 --> 1:13:46,562
The onset of the whole UFO
phenomenon, beginning about 1946/47


1437
1:13:46,562 --> 1:13:48,75
I don't think it's
co-incidence that


1438
1:13:48,75 --> 1:13:51,873
that coincided with our
development of nuclear weapons.


1439
1:13:51,873 --> 1:13:54,951
And I think, that out in the
universe, they were horrified.


1440
1:13:54,951 --> 1:13:59,474
They said, oh my God, the
kids have found the matches!


1441
1:13:59,474 --> 1:14:1,611
Well they don't want us
to destroy ourselves,


1442
1:14:1,611 --> 1:14:3,956
and they don't want us
to destroy this planet,


1443
1:14:3,956 --> 1:14:7,38
and yet they're
prohibited from directly,


1444
1:14:7,38 --> 1:14:9,601
intervening in our
affairs and our evolution,


1445
1:14:9,601 --> 1:14:13,701
so I think that we've got crop
circles, and animal mutilations and


1446
1:14:13,701 --> 1:14:18,201
abductions and sightings, and
increasing sightings and all like that,


1447
1:14:18,201 --> 1:14:22,901
so that it's not directly impacting on
us and yet over this conditioning period,


1448
1:14:22,901 --> 1:14:26,786
we are coming to understand, that
we're not the only ones in the universe,


1449
1:14:26,786 --> 1:14:31,476
and I think they're trying to kind of,
boost us up the evolutionary ladder,


1450
1:14:31,476 --> 1:14:38,606
so that we can grow to be full class
members of the intergalactic community,


1451
1:14:38,606 --> 1:14:45,581
instead of destroying ourselves through our
petty bickering wars, and nuclear holocaust.


1452
1:14:45,581 --> 1:14:50,633
Like a dawning of a new day, the internet is
quickly sweeping away the darkness.


1453
1:14:50,633 --> 1:14:53,1
The truth will
not be stopped.


1454
1:14:53,1 --> 1:14:58,701
We're now seeing this wall of censorship
cracking apart in the United States.


1455
1:14:58,701 --> 1:15:0,2
Just recently, we had a


1456
1:15:0,2 --> 1:15:3,524
major T.V. network special,


1457
1:15:3,524 --> 1:15:8,951
and I found it absolutely amazing
because, Peter Jennings of A.B.C., flat,


1458
1:15:8,951 --> 1:15:12,278
just very matter-of-factly
told a national audience


1459
1:15:12,278 --> 1:15:15,243
that the Robertson
Panel, of the 1950's,


1460
1:15:15,243 --> 1:15:19,814
and the Operation Bluebook,
Project Bluebook, of the 1960's,


1461
1:15:19,814 --> 1:15:24,986
were not really scientific based investigations,
they were just public relations efforts,


1462
1:15:24,986 --> 1:15:28,703
to try to get people not
to be thinking about UFOs.


1463
1:15:28,703 --> 1:15:32,802
So in other words, all you folks out
there who are old enough to have been,


1464
1:15:32,802 --> 1:15:37,906
seen all the newspaper reports on the
Robertson Panel and heard what Bluebook said,


1465
1:15:37,906 --> 1:15:40,654
It was just hogwash,
never mind!!


1466
1:15:40,654 --> 1:15:44,191
The non-human intelligence presence,
has been here for a long time,


1467
1:15:44,191 --> 1:15:48,7
that, Colonel Philip Corso said
there are 57 different races,


1468
1:15:48,7 --> 1:15:52,501
and that some accords were made
to talk about their presence,


1469
1:15:52,501 --> 1:15:56,945
whether it be Hollywood movies or
whatever, including the A.B.C. special,


1470
1:15:56,945 --> 1:16:1,901
that if it isn't done soon,
they will probably do it!


1471
1:16:1,901 --> 1:16:7,592
Extraterrestrials are not
a national security issue!


1472
1:16:7,592 --> 1:16:11,88
They're an educational and
social issue for our society.


1473
1:16:11,88 --> 1:16:14,651
And they may
be a spiritual issue!


1474
1:16:14,651 --> 1:16:16,445
When I retired
from the military,


1475
1:16:16,445 --> 1:16:20,151
I went to work for the Federal
Emergency Management Agency,


1476
1:16:20,151 --> 1:16:22,969
and I worked with
them for 14 years.


1477
1:16:22,969 --> 1:16:25,901
So I've got 42 years of
government service behind me,


1478
1:16:25,901 --> 1:16:27,558
and throughout
all those years,


1479
1:16:27,558 --> 1:16:31,401
I had the very highest security
classification you could have,


1480
1:16:31,401 --> 1:16:32,948
Top Secret.


1481
1:16:32,948 --> 1:16:37,993
When I was in N.A.T.O.
in 1963, through 1967,


1482
1:16:37,993 --> 1:16:40,58
I had Cosmic
Top Secret,


1483
1:16:40,58 --> 1:16:46,573
Which was and still is, the
highest level of security in N.A.T.O.


1484
1:16:46,573 --> 1:16:50,353
That's how I got involved
in this, this crazy UFO field!


1485
1:16:50,353 --> 1:16:56,936
Through the 1950's, 60's and 70's we
referred to aliens as extraterrestrials,


1486
1:16:56,936 --> 1:17:0,562
but now that science has
been catching up with us,


1487
1:17:0,562 --> 1:17:2,48
to a certain degree,


1488
1:17:2,48 --> 1:17:6,916
we have changed our
definition, of an alien.


1489
1:17:6,916 --> 1:17:11,727
It's probably more accurate to
call them extra dimensional beings.


1490
1:17:11,727 --> 1:17:17,411
Because that would explain their
ability to traverse vast distances.


1491
1:17:17,411 --> 1:17:18,795
They operate in
more dimensions,


1492
1:17:18,795 --> 1:17:23,301
I mean, even the current
theoretical model of the universe,


1493
1:17:23,301 --> 1:17:27,77
is upwards of
30 dimensions!


1494
1:17:27,77 --> 1:17:29,736
So we're living in a multi
dimensional universe.


1495
1:17:29,736 --> 1:17:36,6
And so it's not uncommon to theorize
that we're going to encounter beings,


1496
1:17:36,6 --> 1:17:39,1
that operate in more
dimensions than we do.


1497
1:17:39,1 --> 1:17:43,826
And that would explain allot of
the phenomenon related to UFOs.


1498
1:17:43,826 --> 1:17:47,751
How they're able to appear and
disappear, move very fast,


1499
1:17:47,751 --> 1:17:51,382
do all the things that the
E.T.s do, walk through walls,


1500
1:17:51,382 --> 1:17:53,751
have remarkable
psychic abilities,


1501
1:17:53,751 --> 1:17:56,234
and communicate
telepathically,


1502
1:17:56,234 --> 1:18:0,1
It would really go a long way to
explain the phenomenon surrounding it.


1503
1:18:0,1 --> 1:18:3,306
What looks like magic to
us, can really be explained,


1504
1:18:3,306 --> 1:18:5,879
through extra
dimensionality.


1505
1:18:5,879 --> 1:18:9,5
Are any of us really prepared
for the kind of paradigm shift


1506
1:18:9,5 --> 1:18:12,33
that would come with
not just disclosure,


1507
1:18:12,33 --> 1:18:16,96
but with contact and communication
with intelligences from other worlds?


1508
1:18:16,96 --> 1:18:17,27
Is it possible,


1509
1:18:17,27 --> 1:18:20,1
that as a species we have
reached the point that our minds


1510
1:18:20,1 --> 1:18:23,323
actually filter and generate
acceptable constructs,


1511
1:18:23,323 --> 1:18:28,438
which all too often become
our day to day realities?


1512
1:18:28,438 --> 1:18:36,357
There is so little of your reality
that is really based on truth,


1513
1:18:36,357 --> 1:18:42,701
that it is just,
stunning!


1514
1:18:42,701 --> 1:18:47,651
I heard that there are
other worlds that are inhabited.


1515
1:18:47,651 --> 1:19:7,3
and Father
Rapile answered,


1516
1:19:7,3 --> 1:19:12,172
Would you believe that it would just be our
tiny world that would be giving glory to God?


1517
1:19:12,172 --> 1:19:15,966
There has to be many more
worlds, many more planets,


1518
1:19:15,966 --> 1:19:21,266
that exist, with inhabitants that would
be giving glory to God, it is not just us.


1519
1:19:21,266 --> 1:19:23,501
If I told you
that uh,


1520
1:19:23,501 --> 1:19:25,585
you know, the very nature
of the Moon and Mars


1521
1:19:25,585 --> 1:19:28,42
and most of the planets
in the Solar System


1522
1:19:28,42 --> 1:19:30,1
is being kept from you
for specific reasons,


1523
1:19:30,1 --> 1:19:32,216
to make you think that
you're completely alone,


1524
1:19:32,216 --> 1:19:33,991
and that these planets
can't be colonized.


1525
1:19:33,991 --> 1:19:36,422
Back in the 1950's,
the big question was:


1526
1:19:36,422 --> 1:19:37,849
Do they come
from Mars?


1527
1:19:37,849 --> 1:19:40,47
Or do they come
from Venus?


1528
1:19:40,47 --> 1:19:43,101
And by the 1960's and 70's
we had gotten a little more


1529
1:19:43,101 --> 1:19:46,751
sophisticated in our
intellect and in our thinking,


1530
1:19:46,751 --> 1:19:47,701
and the question
became:


1531
1:19:47,701 --> 1:19:50,347
Well, do they come
from Alfa Centauri?


1532
1:19:50,347 --> 1:19:53,693
or Zeta Reticula 4?
You know.


1533
1:19:53,693 --> 1:19:57,251
Now up to the day, and we've
gotten even more sophisticated,


1534
1:19:57,251 --> 1:19:58,813
and now the
question is:


1535
1:19:58,813 --> 1:20:0,25
Do they come from
another planet?


1536
1:20:0,25 --> 1:20:2,351
Or do they come from
another dimension?


1537
1:20:2,351 --> 1:20:4,251
Or are they perhaps
time travelers?


1538
1:20:4,251 --> 1:20:7,285
Do they come from
another time? OK.


1539
1:20:7,285 --> 1:20:9,726
And in my study
of all of this,


1540
1:20:9,726 --> 1:20:13,502
I have kind of come to the
conclusion that the answer,


1541
1:20:13,502 --> 1:20:15,203
is, YES!


1542
1:20:15,203 --> 1:20:18,101
The more you know about this
field, it becomes almost paralyzing.


1543
1:20:18,101 --> 1:20:20,52
Because the more you
know, the less you know.


1544
1:20:20,52 --> 1:20:25,151
The more you know, and the more
open minded that you are about this,


1545
1:20:25,151 --> 1:20:28,801
the more you realize that every
answer you find, just leads to,


1546
1:20:28,801 --> 1:20:30,524
you know, a thousand
more questions.


1547
1:20:30,524 --> 1:20:35,536
Vast sums of money are being siphoned
through these different agencies,


1548
1:20:35,536 --> 1:20:41,748
into the coffers of the C.I.A., which then
forwards this money onto the D.O.D.


1549
1:20:41,748 --> 1:20:46,88
and this money is funneled through the
D.O.D. and goes into the Black Projects,


1550
1:20:46,88 --> 1:20:50,451
which the D.O.D. has
direct oversight over.


1551
1:20:50,451 --> 1:20:53,291
So the C.I.A. is kind of like the
bagman, that collects the money.


1552
1:20:53,291 --> 1:20:56,498
It goes to the Department of
Defense, that actually administers


1553
1:20:56,498 --> 1:20:59,44
how this money is going to be
spent on different Black Projects.


1554
1:20:59,44 --> 1:21:2,301
So, the size. How much
are we talking about?


1555
1:21:2,301 --> 1:21:6,357
I think the best indication for just
how much we are talking about here,


1556
1:21:6,357 --> 1:21:11,28
are the auditing irregularities that
the Inspector General of the D.O.D.


1557
1:21:11,28 --> 1:21:12,976
has himself identified.


1558
1:21:12,976 --> 1:21:21,801
He identified, in 3 years, it was
1998, 1999, and the year 2000.


1559
1:21:21,801 --> 1:21:24,534
In those 3 years,
he identified,


1560
1:21:24,534 --> 1:21:27,601
on average, 1.7
trillion dollars,


1561
1:21:27,601 --> 1:21:29,81
could not be
accounted for,


1562
1:21:29,81 --> 1:21:31,201
in the Department
of Defense budget.


1563
1:21:31,201 --> 1:21:35,771
In other words, this was money
that was being moved around


1564
1:21:35,771 --> 1:21:37,906
in ways that could
not be accounted for.


1565
1:21:37,906 --> 1:21:42,503
And I think, what that indicates is,
the true size of the Black budget.


1566
1:21:42,503 --> 1:21:45,371
We're looking at
an infrastructure,


1567
1:21:45,371 --> 1:21:46,931
that is funded
by as much as,


1568
1:21:46,931 --> 1:21:49,201
1.7 trillion
dollars a year.


1569
1:21:49,201 --> 1:21:52,901
Now when you consider that
the whole D.O.D. budget, officially,


1570
1:21:52,901 --> 1:21:57,91
is just over 400
billion dollars,


1571
1:21:57,91 --> 1:21:59,61
We're talking about
a vast infrastructure,


1572
1:21:59,61 --> 1:21:59,462
that is,


1573
1:21:59,462 --> 1:22:4,351
Four times greater than
the entire D.O.D. budget!


1574
1:22:4,351 --> 1:22:7,435
As Jack Nicholson would say:
You can't handle the truth!


1575
1:22:7,435 --> 1:22:10,949
Is it possible that ancient
and secret societies exist,


1576
1:22:10,949 --> 1:22:14,451
that have always had the
real, but hidden information?


1577
1:22:14,451 --> 1:22:17,816
And have they, as a result of
their ongoing familial knowledge,


1578
1:22:17,816 --> 1:22:19,395
been manipulating
and governing,


1579
1:22:19,395 --> 1:22:22,579
virtually all countries down
through the centuries?


1580
1:22:22,579 --> 1:22:25,359
Researchers point
to the Illuminati,


1581
1:22:25,359 --> 1:22:27,65
and the power elite and
their use of propaganda,


1582
1:22:27,65 --> 1:22:30,411
as carried by the
mainstream media.


1583
1:22:30,411 --> 1:22:34,85
Many believe that these powerful few
actually control almost all information,


1584
1:22:34,85 --> 1:22:39,501
by implanting false knowledge and
beliefs into our human collective reality.


1585
1:22:39,501 --> 1:22:43,371
Essentially, everything that you would
want to know has been covered up.


1586
1:22:43,371 --> 1:22:47,539
From the electro genetic
magnificence of your DNA,


1587
1:22:47,539 --> 1:22:50,51
being a spiritual
antenna to the creator,


1588
1:22:50,51 --> 1:22:54,701
to the most amazing, perfagering
mystery score mathematics,


1589
1:22:54,701 --> 1:22:56,848
that is essentially
freeing to humanity,


1590
1:22:56,848 --> 1:23:0,466
in essence, also
very, very clear,


1591
1:23:0,466 --> 1:23:5,501
that everything in our
world, is a divine creation,


1592
1:23:5,501 --> 1:23:10,501
where as the math is the expressive
tool of the creator for creationism.


1593
1:23:10,501 --> 1:23:13,745
The United States government,
the leader of the free world,


1594
1:23:13,745 --> 1:23:17,1
is totally controlled
by a wealthy oligarchy,


1595
1:23:17,1 --> 1:23:18,651
a small, handful
of people,


1596
1:23:18,651 --> 1:23:20,52
that are just
super rich.


1597
1:23:20,52 --> 1:23:22,221
Most of them are not
even in government.


1598
1:23:22,221 --> 1:23:25,516
But they tell the
government what to do.


1599
1:23:25,516 --> 1:23:29,316
These are the people who
are behind the UFO secrecy.


1600
1:23:29,316 --> 1:23:33,636
They don't care if you know
there's E.T.s out there,


1601
1:23:33,636 --> 1:23:35,738
but if you know
there's E.T.s out there,


1602
1:23:35,738 --> 1:23:41,7
then you will know that
there is alternative technology.


1603
1:23:41,7 --> 1:23:44,659
And this could
upset the monopolies,


1604
1:23:44,659 --> 1:23:50,722
over energy, fuel, transportation,
communications, pharmaceuticals.


1605
1:23:50,722 --> 1:23:52,551
And that's what
they don't want.


1606
1:23:52,551 --> 1:23:53,35
After all,


1607
1:23:53,35 --> 1:23:58,437
who would continue to pay all these
ever increasing prices for gasoline,


1608
1:23:58,437 --> 1:23:59,7
thatâ€™s polluting
the air,


1609
1:23:59,7 --> 1:24:1,1
choking us all,


1610
1:24:1,1 --> 1:24:2,516
killing our kids.


1611
1:24:2,516 --> 1:24:6,266
Why would we do that if we knew,
beyond any shadow of a doubt,


1612
1:24:6,266 --> 1:24:10,147
that there was non-polluting
energy sources out there?


1613
1:24:10,147 --> 1:24:11,974
This is what
it's all about.


1614
1:24:11,974 --> 1:24:14,385
It comes back to the
old journalistic adage.


1615
1:24:14,385 --> 1:24:16,577
Follow the money.


1616
1:24:16,577 --> 1:24:18,536
Everything has been
covered up.


1617
1:24:18,536 --> 1:24:21,51
Toxicities of the
pharmaceuticals.


1618
1:24:21,51 --> 1:24:23,201
You're not learning the
truth about vaccinations.


1619
1:24:23,201 --> 1:24:25,851
You're not learning the truth
about various medications.


1620
1:24:25,851 --> 1:24:28,41
The pharmaceutical
industrialists,


1621
1:24:28,41 --> 1:24:29,201
which I prefer
to call the,


1622
1:24:29,201 --> 1:24:34,386
Military Medical Petrochemical
Pharmaceutical Cartel!


1623
1:24:34,386 --> 1:24:37,561
Essentially has control of the
media, the mainstream media.


1624
1:24:37,561 --> 1:24:40,381
And so it has control
over the mass mind.


1625
1:24:40,381 --> 1:24:44,829
And as a result of those
powers that they assert,


1626
1:24:44,829 --> 1:24:47,301
people are not given
factual information


1627
1:24:47,301 --> 1:24:49,1
upon which to make
informed decisions.


1628
1:24:49,1 --> 1:24:51,639
They're given
propaganda.


1629
1:24:51,639 --> 1:24:56,482
And as a result, the choices that
people are making are genocidal.


1630
1:24:56,482 --> 1:24:59,918
And I say genocidal with a
strict definition, meaning,


1631
1:24:59,918 --> 1:25:4,801
the mass killing of people for economic,
political and/or ideological reasons.


1632
1:25:4,801 --> 1:25:7,701
And those pharmaceutical
industrialists are


1633
1:25:7,701 --> 1:25:11,741
intimately connected to those people
who wish to control populations.


1634
1:25:11,741 --> 1:25:14,851
They've published literature
of what their intent is.


1635
1:25:14,851 --> 1:25:19,551
Not only how best to control populations,
why populations need to be controlled,


1636
1:25:19,551 --> 1:25:24,951
but ultimately, affecting the technologies
that are in place to do just that


1637
1:25:24,951 --> 1:25:27,751
Currently, a 50%
reduction in general,


1638
1:25:27,751 --> 1:25:31,329
of the planets population has
been targeted for illimination.


1639
1:25:31,329 --> 1:25:33,623
The Disclosure Project is oriented
towards putting together


1640
1:25:33,623 --> 1:25:37,24
credible government documents
and these witnesses, so that


1641
1:25:37,24 --> 1:25:41,451
there is an undeniable case made
that this is real and not fictitious.


1642
1:25:41,451 --> 1:25:44,547
It started really in 19...
the early 1990's.


1643
1:25:44,547 --> 1:25:50,51
After I had briefed President Clinton's
first C.I.A. director of this problem.


1644
1:25:50,51 --> 1:25:52,465
It was made very clear to me
that the executive branch,


1645
1:25:52,465 --> 1:25:55,401
of the U.S. government, did not
want to do this because,


1646
1:25:55,401 --> 1:25:56,701
I'm quoting.


1647
1:25:56,701 --> 1:25:59,687
"The President was concerned he
would end up like Jack Kennedy."


1648
1:25:59,687 --> 1:26:0,36
And I'm not kidding.


1649
1:26:0,36 --> 1:26:2,951
That was said to me by
President Clinton's closest friend.


1650
1:26:2,951 --> 1:26:6,398
Could it be that much of
what we believe is illusion?


1651
1:26:6,398 --> 1:26:11,721
Is it possible that the history of human
civilization is not as we have been told?


1652
1:26:11,721 --> 1:26:15,294
Have we as people, been
purposefully dumbed down?


1653
1:26:15,294 --> 1:26:18,41
And, have our governments only
served to strengthen the bonds,


1654
1:26:18,41 --> 1:26:20,358
that bind us to
our ignorance?


1655
1:26:20,358 --> 1:26:25,51
Not only of our past, but of our
present and potential future?


1656
1:26:25,51 --> 1:26:29,551
Officials in these agencies no longer
represent the best interests of humanity,


1657
1:26:29,551 --> 1:26:33,621
but are now representing the interests
of a particular extraterrestrial race,


1658
1:26:33,621 --> 1:26:35,61
that they have been
compromised by.


1659
1:26:35,61 --> 1:26:39,442
So we pay a heavy price if
we don't make this open.


1660
1:26:39,442 --> 1:26:41,801
If we don't bring in transparency
and accountability,


1661
1:26:41,801 --> 1:26:43,983
into this
whole process,


1662
1:26:43,983 --> 1:26:46,739
it means that we donâ€™t
know whether or not,


1663
1:26:46,739 --> 1:26:48,901
those that are
behind the policies,


1664
1:26:48,901 --> 1:26:51,63
are actually implementing
these policies for the best


1665
1:26:51,63 --> 1:26:54,186
interest of humanity,
which is what they claim,


1666
1:26:54,186 --> 1:26:57,541
or for the best interest of a
particular extraterrestrial race.


1667
1:26:57,541 --> 1:27:0,505
Some of the questions
that we must ask include:


1668
1:27:0,505 --> 1:27:2,778
Are there bases
on our moon?


1669
1:27:2,778 --> 1:27:5,1
Are there structures
and life forms on Mars,


1670
1:27:5,1 --> 1:27:7,475
and many of the
other local planets?


1671
1:27:7,475 --> 1:27:10,45
Have our governments made deals
and treaties with other life forms,


1672
1:27:10,45 --> 1:27:21,7
that affect the future of
all of us on planet Earth?


1673
1:27:21,7 --> 1:27:27,691
These people will continue,
zipping through our atmosphere


1674
1:27:27,691 --> 1:27:31,533
checking our nuclear
plants and so forth and so on.


1675
1:27:31,533 --> 1:27:33,427
They have never
been hostile.


1676
1:27:33,427 --> 1:27:38,314
They pose no air security
problems, whatever.


1677
1:27:38,314 --> 1:27:42,811
The Air force knows this and the Air force
has made statements to that effect.


1678
1:27:42,811 --> 1:27:46,899
That UFOs pose
NO threat.


1679
1:27:46,899 --> 1:27:48,726
THEY ARE HERE.


1680
1:27:48,726 --> 1:27:53,282
Not just the Greys, but the
others, who look and act like us.


1681
1:27:53,282 --> 1:27:55,374
Perhaps they are
here to instruct us.


1682
1:27:55,374 --> 1:27:57,788
To help us safeguard
our planet.


1683
1:27:57,788 --> 1:28:2,102
Definitely rules and regulations
are governing everything.


1684
1:28:2,102 --> 1:28:4,825
And the councils have
the history books


1685
1:28:4,825 --> 1:28:7,72
of all the planets
and all of the records.


1686
1:28:7,72 --> 1:28:11,679
So when a planet reaches the
point that it can support life,


1687
1:28:11,679 --> 1:28:16,1
That's a very momentous time
in the history of that planet.


1688
1:28:16,1 --> 1:28:19,601
At that time, the planet
is given it's life charter.


1689
1:28:19,601 --> 1:28:23,48
We're dealing with
a BIG, BIG story.


1690
1:28:23,48 --> 1:28:25,899
It's not just them.


1691
1:28:25,899 --> 1:28:27,721
As I've said, if it
was that simple,


1692
1:28:27,721 --> 1:28:30,425
it would have probably
been out some time back.


1693
1:28:30,425 --> 1:28:32,677
It's really about us.


1694
1:28:32,677 --> 1:28:35,725
It's who we are, what we
are, how we came to be.


1695
1:28:35,725 --> 1:28:39,201
and where we might
end up going, sometime.


1696
1:28:39,201 --> 1:28:44,915
Life is never allowed to just
simply spontaneously develop.


1697
1:28:44,915 --> 1:28:47,511
If it did, it would
be very chaotic.


1698
1:28:47,511 --> 1:28:49,291
If we could integrate,


1699
1:28:49,291 --> 1:28:52,608
I call it the spiritual, but
the esoteric or whatever.


1700
1:28:52,608 --> 1:28:55,551
But I mean true esoteric, I
don't mean religion necessarily,


1701
1:28:55,551 --> 1:28:58,501
because there is a difference I
think, between religion and spirituality.


1702
1:28:58,501 --> 1:29:1,601
To produce a thinking,
intelligent human being,


1703
1:29:1,601 --> 1:29:3,958
would have taken
millions more years,


1704
1:29:3,958 --> 1:29:7,231
than what's happening
by normal evolution,


1705
1:29:7,231 --> 1:29:8,511
than it would
have taken.


1706
1:29:8,511 --> 1:29:11,676
and it would have still, not
of got to the point we are now.


1707
1:29:11,676 --> 1:29:16,503
They create life on other planets, because
this is the way they were created.


1708
1:29:16,503 --> 1:29:21,615
By what they called the Archaic ones,
the ones' from the very beginning,


1709
1:29:21,615 --> 1:29:23,687
have been doing
this forever.


1710
1:29:23,687 --> 1:29:27,501
Mankind was developed as
a species, as a spiritual being.


1711
1:29:27,501 --> 1:29:30,899
And I think we've gotten so far
away from who we really are,


1712
1:29:30,899 --> 1:29:34,176
that it's very hard for us to
go back there and digest,


1713
1:29:34,176 --> 1:29:36,675
that maybe we have
cosmic brothers and sisters.


1714
1:29:36,675 --> 1:29:39,1
We fight among
ourselves for diversity.


1715
1:29:39,1 --> 1:29:41,651
I mean, if anybody walks in
here and looks totally different


1716
1:29:41,651 --> 1:29:42,851
we fight among ourselves.


1717
1:29:42,851 --> 1:29:44,1
Now I'm thinking,
oh my God!


1718
1:29:44,1 --> 1:29:47,241
What are the E.T.s that are
involved, thinking about,


1719
1:29:47,241 --> 1:29:50,801
the way we handle ourselves, with
people that are so different from us,


1720
1:29:50,801 --> 1:29:54,15
They're probably scared to death to appear
because of what we might do to them.


1721
1:29:54,15 --> 1:29:57,881
We have not handled
diversity very well.


1722
1:29:57,881 --> 1:30:3,171
One day, I would hope
that the people of Earth,


1723
1:30:3,171 --> 1:30:6,716
would stand up and
extend their hand in friendship


1724
1:30:6,716 --> 1:30:10,466
to these people, we have never
done that here on this planet.


1725
1:30:10,466 --> 1:30:13,196
You know, we've
shot at them.


1726
1:30:13,196 --> 1:30:17,662
We've done everything. We've fired
radar, we've fired lasers, everything.


1727
1:30:17,662 --> 1:30:20,801
We need to say.......Hi!


1728
1:30:20,801 --> 1:30:24,501
There are other extraterrestrial
groups who are human looking,


1729
1:30:24,501 --> 1:30:28,711
such as the Pleiadians, the famous
Pleiadians of Billy Meyer and others.


1730
1:30:28,711 --> 1:30:34,679
And they are much more intent
on trying to assist humanity, to


1731
1:30:34,679 --> 1:30:37,351
become free of this kind
of manipulation from,


1732
1:30:37,351 --> 1:30:41,301
other races, that really try to
use humanity as a resource.


1733
1:30:41,301 --> 1:30:42,701
Let's think about it.


1734
1:30:42,701 --> 1:30:44,721
You can't say,
whoopee! Star kids!


1735
1:30:44,721 --> 1:30:47,684
These wonderful advanced
children have been transformed by


1736
1:30:47,684 --> 1:30:49,515
contact with people
from the stars,


1737
1:30:49,515 --> 1:30:53,161
when in the same breath you say,
there's no such things as UFOs.


1738
1:30:53,161 --> 1:30:55,395
The question of UFOs
and extraterrestrials,


1739
1:30:55,395 --> 1:30:57,966
most people just think
is something entertaining.


1740
1:30:57,966 --> 1:31:1,986
In reality, it's something
that is central to


1741
1:31:1,986 --> 1:31:4,651
how we're going to be able
to go forward as a civilization.


1742
1:31:4,651 --> 1:31:7,4
Because that
issue involves,


1743
1:31:7,4 --> 1:31:10,785
sciences, technologies, energy
and propulsion systems,


1744
1:31:10,785 --> 1:31:13,101
that could give us a
whole new civilization.


1745
1:31:13,101 --> 1:31:14,901
It's terribly important the
whole thing come apart,


1746
1:31:14,901 --> 1:31:16,201
because it's
all one package,


1747
1:31:16,201 --> 1:31:18,315
and it's part of
our bright and very,


1748
1:31:18,315 --> 1:31:20,111
I think, hopeful
future.


1749
1:31:20,111 --> 1:31:22,85
And I think of these star kids
growing up and being our leaders.


1750
1:31:22,85 --> 1:31:25,749
Our presidents, congress
people, senators.


1751
1:31:25,749 --> 1:31:29,836
University professors.


1752
1:31:29,836 --> 1:31:33,38
Leaders in medicine and
science and so forth.


1753
1:31:33,38 --> 1:31:37,301
I think what brilliant and expansive
future we're going to have,


1754
1:31:37,301 --> 1:31:40,236
but we have to get from
point A to point B, and


1755
1:31:40,236 --> 1:31:44,235
this cover-up is just stultifying
us in a very painful way.


1756
1:31:44,235 --> 1:31:48,2
Is it possible that an
intergalactic federation exists,


1757
1:31:48,2 --> 1:31:50,451
and that this collective
of different member beings,


1758
1:31:50,451 --> 1:31:53,28
are in the process of
offering the people of Earth,


1759
1:31:53,28 --> 1:31:56,221
membership in a
federation of planets?


1760
1:31:56,221 --> 1:31:59,151
Most importantly for all
of us and our children,


1761
1:31:59,151 --> 1:32:0,9
some of these
researchers say,


1762
1:32:0,9 --> 1:32:4,271
that acceptance of their invitation
to federation membership,


1763
1:32:4,271 --> 1:32:6,0
would end all war,


1764
1:32:6,0 --> 1:32:10,201
starvation and dependency upon
fossil fuel based energy systems,


1765
1:32:10,201 --> 1:32:13,91
for our entire planet.


1766
1:32:13,91 --> 1:32:15,701
Part of the problem with the
UFO cover-up coming apart;


1767
1:32:15,701 --> 1:32:17,8
You've got to uncover the
whole thing at the same time.


1768
1:32:17,8 --> 1:32:19,731
You can't half
uncover it.


1769
1:32:19,731 --> 1:32:26,1
People who try, they
only look stupid!


1770
1:32:26,1 --> 1:32:35,179
but, they are doing it for us,
they are praying for us!


1771
1:32:35,179 --> 1:32:40,797
We are the lowest of the
category in the evolutionary scale.


1772
1:32:40,797 --> 1:32:45,351
He really believes that humanity is the lowest
of the category of the evolutionary scale.


1773
1:32:45,351 --> 1:32:48,686
With all the proof that he gave
you of the ecological problem,


1774
1:32:48,686 --> 1:32:50,3
of the war problem,


1775
1:32:50,3 --> 1:32:53,501
of the, choosing evil
problem, and all that.


1776
1:32:53,501 --> 1:32:55,316
This is his belief system.


1777
1:32:55,316 --> 1:32:59,801
We all have a responsibility to find out
what the truth is about something like this.


1778
1:32:59,801 --> 1:33:3,501
People have to take responsibility
for looking into what the truth is.


1779
1:33:3,501 --> 1:33:6,109
We've put together the
means, for people to do that.


1780
1:33:6,109 --> 1:33:7,901
Now, people have
to take the initiative.


1781
1:33:7,901 --> 1:33:9,251
And we need all
the help we can get!


1782
1:33:9,251 --> 1:33:11,701
I would ask people to
help us network this to,


1783
1:33:11,701 --> 1:33:15,279
anyone and any
institution that can help.


1784
1:33:15,279 --> 1:33:17,301
The reason this is so
critical, is that-


1785
1:33:17,301 --> 1:33:19,64
We've reached a point
in our civilization,


1786
1:33:19,64 --> 1:33:23,67
where, for us to go
forward, as a people,


1787
1:33:23,67 --> 1:33:26,51
we're going to have to end
this kind of illegal secrecy.


1788
1:33:26,51 --> 1:33:30,251
And we're going to have to allow this
information and these technologies,


1789
1:33:30,251 --> 1:33:34,406
to get out and begin to fix
many of these large problems.


1790
1:33:34,406 --> 1:33:39,194
I've always believed
our destiny is in the stars.


1791
1:33:39,194 --> 1:33:41,46
That's a hope that I have.


1792
1:33:41,46 --> 1:33:45,708
Generations yet to
come, will travel out there.


1793
1:33:45,708 --> 1:33:50,4
And we'll become a
part of that community.


1794
1:33:50,4 --> 1:33:53,504
That's a dream that I
won't live to see, but,


1795
1:33:53,504 --> 1:33:56,452
it's a dream I hold dear.


1796
1:33:56,452 --> 1:33:58,94
That we'll make it.


1797
1:33:58,94 --> 1:34:2,86
That we will survive
as a species.


1798
1:34:2,86 --> 1:34:4,306
Because I think
we've got some,


1799
1:34:4,306 --> 1:34:9,0
I jokingly say, we have some
good friends in high places.
