0:0:4,35 --> 0:0:25,33



3
0:0:25,33 --> 0:0:28,49
SHANE SMITH: The next stop on
our tour of North Korean


4
0:0:28,49 --> 0:0:32,64
boredom and propaganda was the
Great People's Library, which


5
0:0:32,64 --> 0:0:34,87
is this massive library
that they're very,


6
0:0:34,87 --> 0:0:36,8
very excited about.


7
0:0:36,8 --> 0:0:38,325
And they make you walk the
whole god damn thing.


8
0:0:38,325 --> 0:0:44,2



9
0:0:44,2 --> 0:0:48,3
And the first thing you learn
is that Kim Jong Il invented


10
0:0:48,3 --> 0:0:51,95
the best, most perfect reading
desk because you can alter the


11
0:0:51,95 --> 0:0:53,2
level of the desk.


12
0:0:53,2 --> 0:1:4,99



13
0:1:4,99 --> 0:1:5,7
SHANE SMITH: Kim Jong
Il invented it.


14
0:1:5,7 --> 0:1:7,255
And it's the best desk ever.


15
0:1:7,255 --> 0:1:8,73
And you're like, OK.


16
0:1:8,73 --> 0:1:10,15
It's a table with--


17
0:1:10,15 --> 0:1:12,16
You can move a level.


18
0:1:12,16 --> 0:1:13,41
It's like a simple table.


19
0:1:13,41 --> 0:1:23,35



20
0:1:23,35 --> 0:1:25,47
Then they take you to the
philosopher hotline, which I


21
0:1:25,47 --> 0:1:28,49
found pretty interesting,
which is if you have a


22
0:1:28,49 --> 0:1:31,83
philosophical, Marxist,
dialectic problem, then you


23
0:1:31,83 --> 0:1:35,98
can come to the library and
ask the philosopher god.


24
0:1:35,98 --> 0:2:1,958



25
0:2:1,958 --> 0:2:4,95
SHANE SMITH: And that's it.


26
0:2:4,95 --> 0:2:6,2
Thank you.


27
0:2:6,2 --> 0:2:13,49



28
0:2:13,49 --> 0:2:15,66
The other thing I found amazing
is they're very proud


29
0:2:15,66 --> 0:2:17,31
of their modern music library.


30
0:2:17,31 --> 0:2:18,29
They've got the Beatles.


31
0:2:18,29 --> 0:2:22,77
And they've got Bob
Dylan and stuff.


32
0:2:22,77 --> 0:2:25,3
But the music room was
completely empty.


33
0:2:25,3 --> 0:2:27,32
And I started thinking
about why they have


34
0:2:27,32 --> 0:2:28,53
this kind of place.


35
0:2:28,53 --> 0:2:31,69
It seemed to me that it was used
for maybe upper echelons,


36
0:2:31,69 --> 0:2:35,38
or party officials, or guides,
or wannabe guards to learn


37
0:2:35,38 --> 0:2:39,77
idiomatic speech so that they'll
understand what we say


38
0:2:39,77 --> 0:2:42,29
when we talk in vernacular.


39
0:2:42,29 --> 0:2:46,8
And so you can picture them with
headphones on listening,


40
0:2:46,8 --> 0:2:47,73
going, "Abbey Road.


41
0:2:47,73 --> 0:3:7,66
I understand those
bastards now."


42
0:3:7,66 --> 0:3:55,62



43
0:3:55,62 --> 0:4:5,6



44
0:4:5,6 --> 0:4:7,56
SHANE SMITH: They made us get
up at 6:00 in the morning.


45
0:4:7,56 --> 0:4:9,11
We get put in the truck.


46
0:4:9,11 --> 0:4:10,33
And we just drive.


47
0:4:10,33 --> 0:4:12,61
We drove for four hours.


48
0:4:12,61 --> 0:4:14,82
And when we get out,
we're at the sea.


49
0:4:14,82 --> 0:4:17,69
And there's this huge thing,
which is called a barrage.


50
0:4:17,69 --> 0:4:18,95
I didn't know what
a barrage was.


51
0:4:18,95 --> 0:4:21,48
But it's basically a huge dam.


52
0:4:21,48 --> 0:4:23,85
And they've dammed up
the Taedong River.


53
0:4:23,85 --> 0:4:26,3
And it's just a triumph
of the will.


54
0:4:26,3 --> 0:4:28,35
And oh my god, it's the
biggest, greatest


55
0:4:28,35 --> 0:4:29,68
thing we ever did.


56
0:4:29,68 --> 0:4:33,595
And now it's being blamed for
the huge floods that they have


57
0:4:33,595 --> 0:4:37,18
and the famine, because
of the floods.


58
0:4:37,18 --> 0:4:40,48
And it's destroyed all their
rice growing crops, which they


59
0:4:40,48 --> 0:4:44,11
don't have much of because it's
a mountainous country.


60
0:4:44,11 --> 0:4:46,34
They ended up destroying
all the arable land


61
0:4:46,34 --> 0:4:47,59
that they had left.


62
0:4:47,59 --> 0:4:55,232



63
0:4:55,232 --> 0:4:56,76
JAMIE: You don't want him
to stand in front


64
0:4:56,76 --> 0:5:0,305
of the Great Leader?


65
0:5:0,305 --> 0:5:2,62
SHANE SMITH: Don't
block the shot.


66
0:5:2,62 --> 0:5:2,536
OK.


67
0:5:2,536 --> 0:5:3,484
JAMIE: OK.


68
0:5:3,484 --> 0:5:4,91
SHANE SMITH: I'm going
to stand to the side.


69
0:5:4,91 --> 0:5:7,15
JAMIE: Shane, don't stand in
front of the Dear Leader


70
0:5:7,15 --> 0:5:8,13
because you're blocking him.


71
0:5:8,13 --> 0:5:9,53
SHANE SMITH: OK.


72
0:5:9,53 --> 0:5:12,37
But they're so freaked out about
the barrage, that we


73
0:5:12,37 --> 0:5:14,71
were filming it, which
is why he brought us


74
0:5:14,71 --> 0:5:15,48
out there, I thought.


75
0:5:15,48 --> 0:5:17,86
And they're like, film
it anything more,


76
0:5:17,86 --> 0:5:19,576
you're going to jail.


77
0:5:19,576 --> 0:5:21,77
Don't stand in front
of the Dear Leader.


78
0:5:21,77 --> 0:5:24,61
Our political guard-- who we had
nicknamed Speedy Gonzales


79
0:5:24,61 --> 0:5:27,66
because he looked like a little
zippy guy, and he was


80
0:5:27,66 --> 0:5:29,6
always everywhere--


81
0:5:29,6 --> 0:5:32,0
started to really
get mad at us.


82
0:5:32,0 --> 0:5:34,2
We've just been told not to
stand in front of the picture


83
0:5:34,2 --> 0:5:35,22
of Kim Jong Il.


84
0:5:35,22 --> 0:5:38,3
Actually, Speedy Gonzales, our
guard who hates us shooting,


85
0:5:38,3 --> 0:5:39,43
just saw us.


86
0:5:39,43 --> 0:5:42,17
And he's not letting us shoot.


87
0:5:42,17 --> 0:5:45,35
So I'm just going to talk
about the barrage.


88
0:5:45,35 --> 0:5:45,725
It's beautiful.


89
0:5:45,725 --> 0:5:46,92
It's nice.


90
0:5:46,92 --> 0:5:48,462
And he's looking at
us right now.


91
0:5:48,462 --> 0:5:50,33
It's freaking me out.


92
0:5:50,33 --> 0:5:54,35
He's threatened Jamie, who's
shooting this, with criminal


93
0:5:54,35 --> 0:5:56,285
action, which means to go
to jail here, which


94
0:5:56,285 --> 0:5:58,11
would not be enjoyable.


95
0:5:58,11 --> 0:6:1,683
He's looking at me now, so we're
going to walk over here,


96
0:6:1,683 --> 0:6:3,11
check out the thing
and pretend like


97
0:6:3,11 --> 0:6:5,11
we're shooting something.


98
0:6:5,11 --> 0:6:7,38
They had had enough of
us by this point.


99
0:6:7,38 --> 0:6:9,53
At this point, we started
to get really scared.


100
0:6:9,53 --> 0:6:10,7
They're like, you know what?


101
0:6:10,7 --> 0:6:12,26
Stop filming, stop shooting
anything.


102
0:6:12,26 --> 0:6:14,15
It's totally insane.


103
0:6:14,15 --> 0:6:15,62
One more day.


104
0:6:15,62 --> 0:6:18,7
I keep telling myself,
one more day.


105

106
0:6:25,42 --> 0:7:2,49



107
0:7:2,49 --> 0:7:6,64
SHANE SMITH: One of the fun/sad
times is they took us


108
0:7:6,64 --> 0:7:7,44
to a school.


109
0:7:7,44 --> 0:7:11,6
And it's a school for the best
and brightest, the prodigies.


110
0:7:11,6 --> 0:7:14,53
And you go there, and you see
how great the students are.


111
0:7:14,53 --> 0:7:17,57
And here it's just kids in
uniforms being incredibly


112
0:7:17,57 --> 0:7:20,5
amazing and much better than
we are, of course, at


113
0:7:20,5 --> 0:7:20,89
everything.


114
0:7:20,89 --> 0:7:23,98
So the best needlepointers
are needlepointing away.


115
0:7:23,98 --> 0:7:26,13
And the best guitar players
are playing.


116
0:7:26,13 --> 0:7:28,43
Accordion players, pianists,
the best at


117
0:7:28,43 --> 0:7:30,8

118
0:7:30,8 --> 0:7:32,5
They have people for
enunciation.


119
0:7:32,5 --> 0:7:40,9



120
0:7:40,9 --> 0:7:43,13
There's one kid playing
guitar.


121
0:7:43,13 --> 0:7:43,46
Amazing.


122
0:7:43,46 --> 0:7:44,96
The guitar was bigger
than him.


123
0:7:44,96 --> 0:7:47,48



124
0:7:47,48 --> 0:7:50,5
And again you're like, oh
these great kids and


125
0:7:50,5 --> 0:7:50,47
everything.


126
0:7:50,47 --> 0:7:54,47

because they've been picked

We're going to an art
performance now with the kids.

after the performance.

208
0:17:46,24 --> 0:17:48,92
They have no cultural references
whatsoever.

[SINGING "ANARCHY IN THE UK"]


210
0:18:24,25 --> 0:18:26,4
So when I finished singing,
they're all looking


211
0:18:26,4 --> 0:18:27,29
at me like I'm crazy.


212
0:18:27,29 --> 0:18:29,67
And I realize, they don't
know what punk rock is.


213
0:18:29,67 --> 0:18:31,24
Not only do they not
have rock and roll,


214
0:18:31,24 --> 0:18:32,75
they didn't have jazz.


215
0:18:32,75 --> 0:18:34,39
They didn't have
fucking blues.


216
0:18:34,39 --> 0:18:36,68
They never had any
of this shit.


217
0:18:36,68 --> 0:18:39,385
There are no cultural
similarities whatsoever.


218
0:18:39,385 --> 0:18:43,232

SHANE SMITH: Sometimes I imagine
if someone coming from


221
0:18:49,47 --> 0:18:52,34
the cowboy times-- like someone
who comes in a time


222
0:18:52,34 --> 0:18:54,38
machine or frozen in
ice or something--


223
0:18:54,38 --> 0:18:56,71
and you have to explain to
them what an airplane is.


224
0:18:56,71 --> 0:18:59,86
Or you have to explain what
supermarkets are.


225
0:18:59,86 --> 0:19:2,17
And this is as close
as you get to that.


226
0:19:2,17 --> 0:19:3,93
This is a time machine.


227
0:19:3,93 --> 0:19:7,9
This is 1930s Russia or
1950s Soviet Union.


228
0:19:7,9 --> 0:19:12,32
So they see me as the Yankee
imperialist aggressor.


229
0:19:12,32 --> 0:19:15,365
And I see them as the land
that time forgot.
