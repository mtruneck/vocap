0:0:0,21 --> 0:0:3,58
On those cold, rainy days when you forget
your rain jacket or umbrella and you want


2
0:0:3,58 --> 0:0:7,79
to stay as dry as possibleâ€¦ should you walk
and spend more time in the rain? Or should


3
0:0:7,79 --> 0:0:11,16
you run, which means you'll be smashing into
more raindrops from the side?


4
0:0:11,16 --> 0:0:14,95
Assuming you haven't been fully soaked yet
and you aren't jumping into puddles, the answer


5
0:0:14,95 --> 0:0:18,88
is simple. As you move out of the way of one
falling raindrop, you move into the way of


6
0:0:18,88 --> 0:0:22,169
another. So the amount of rain hitting the
top of you is constant, regardless of how


7
0:0:22,169 --> 0:0:25,179
fast you're going. Alternatively, you can
picture that the raindrops themselves are


8
0:0:25,179 --> 0:0:28,919
stationary and you (and the earth beneath
you) are moving upwards through the rain!


9
0:0:28,919 --> 0:0:32,759
And since the volume of a parallelepiped (that's
a 3D parallelogram) doesn't depend at all


10
0:0:32,759 --> 0:0:36,59
on its slant, then no matter how fast you're
moving horizontally the same amount of rain


11
0:0:36,59 --> 0:0:38,46
will land on top of you each second.


12
0:0:38,46 --> 0:0:42,6
Now, if you're not moving, the rain from the
top is all you'll get. But if you ARE moving,


13
0:0:42,6 --> 0:0:46,739
you'll also run into raindrops from the side
and you'll get wetter. So in any given second,


14
0:0:46,739 --> 0:0:50,539
you stay driest by standing still, and the
faster you move the wetter you become.


15
0:0:50,539 --> 0:0:54,249
But if you're trying to get from point A to
point B, then standing still won't do you


16
0:0:54,249 --> 0:0:58,42
much good. And en route from point A to point
B, the total amount of rain you run into from


17
0:0:58,42 --> 0:1:2,789
the side has nothing to do with how fast you're
going - just like how a snowplow will plow


18
0:1:2,789 --> 0:1:7,6
the same amount of snow from a stretch of
road regardless of the exact speed it drives.


19
0:1:7,6 --> 0:1:10,32
In the case of running through the rain, you
can figure that out using parallelepipeds


20
0:1:10,32 --> 0:1:11,159
again.


21
0:1:11,159 --> 0:1:14,68
So over a given period of time, the same amount
of rain will hit you from the top, regardless


22
0:1:14,68 --> 0:1:18,9
of how fast you're going. And over a given
distance, you'll hit the same amount of rain


23
0:1:18,9 --> 0:1:20,909
from the side - again, regardless of how fast
you're going.


24
0:1:20,909 --> 0:1:24,829
So your total wetness is equal to the wetness
per second for rain from the top times the


25
0:1:24,829 --> 0:1:28,56
amount of time you spend in the rain, plus
the wetness per meter for rain from the side


26
0:1:28,56 --> 0:1:30,479
times the number of meters you travel.


27
0:1:30,479 --> 0:1:33,869
So to stay driest getting from one point to
another, you should try to minimize the amount


28
0:1:33,869 --> 0:1:37,549
of water falling onto you from above. And
quite simply, that means getting out of the


29
0:1:37,549 --> 0:3:37,549
rain as fast as possible.
