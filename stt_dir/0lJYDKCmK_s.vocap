###0 JOHN MCAFEE: I need a lawyer.
###2 And Sam tells me you are a good lawyer.
###6 
###11 Trust me, sir, every newspaper in the world will fly here
###15 instantly to talk to me.
###16 Yes.
###17 Will you please forgive my appearance?
###19 I need a tailor that can very quickly, sir,
###24 make a suit, a shirt.
###27 Because I cannot speak like this.
###30 Thanks, [INAUDIBLE]
###31 SAM VANEGAS: I forgot!
###33 [INAUDIBLE]
###34 
###44 JOHN MCAFEE: So I need to do it?
###46 I need my suit.
###47 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###50 JOHN MCAFEE: Do you have the power, sir, to make this man
###52 sew a little faster?
###54 TELESFORO GUERRA: Of course.
###55 JOHN MCAFEE: Okay, good.
###56 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###56 TELESFORO GUERRA: Of course.
###57 
###62 JOHN MCAFEE: I think there's nothing to prove.
###64 I was not there.
###65 I was with Sam the entire night.
###67 I have more than half a dozen witnesses to the fact.
###72 I had no motive.
###75 I had no access to a 9-millimeter.
###78 I don't what there is to prove, really.
###80 Whatever it is they want to talk to me about, I think, has
###82 very little to do with the murder of Mr. Faull.
###84 And very much to do with their collecting me on any charge
###88 whatsoever.
###91 Where do we have to go?
###92 We'll do it right now.
###92 Just do it now.
###93 Come on.
###95 Right now.
###96 You've never seen this before, have you.
###97 SAM VANEGAS: No, never in my life.
###99 JOHN MCAFEE: This is my life in America, sweetie.
###101 So you'll see that I am quite comfortable with this.
###104 I have for five years lived in Belize peacefully.
###109 Seven months ago, the Belizean government sent 42 armed
###112 soldiers into my property.
###115 They killed one of my dogs.
###117 They broke into all of my houses.
###119 They stole.
###120 They arrested me and kept me handcuffed in
###122 the sun for 14 hours.
###124 I was taken to jail, and it was only the intervention of
###127 the US embassy that got me out of jail.
###129 Since that time, I have been continually harassed by the
###132 government.
###133 They have attempted to charge me with every crime, ranging
###137 from running an antibiotics laboratory without a license,
###141 to hiring security guards without a license, to having
###144 improper paperworks for my company.
###146 And most recently, the murder of my neighbor.
###149 I had to leave, but the story has to get out.
###152 I have documentation that proves the intense corruption
###156 at all levels of the Belizean government.
###159 Now that I am in a safe place, I can speak freely.
###161 I will be talking on my blog, whoismcafee.com, starting
###166 tonight, revealing the truth about Belize.
###168 And thank you very much.
