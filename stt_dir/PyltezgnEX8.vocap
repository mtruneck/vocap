###0 daily news is it good article it's uh...
###2 about map like dot world research into how much
###6 winning s_s_c_ in a congressional seat
###9 costing twenty twelve
###11 way to you lose it
###13 the u_s_ senate
###14 average winning race cost ten million
###17 four hundred seventy six thousand
###20 four hundred and fifty one
###22 so yet and a half million dollars well you know what a satirist
###25 if you don't have ten million dollars good luck to you about it
###30 do we really have a marketing careful armor
###33 you know are metaphor
###35 the t_b_ then become a senator
###38 of course that it is a local farmer kato global poverty ocap even dentist do it
###44 no the only way you can do is you're you're incredibly rich
###49 or
###50 you will in the sucked up to people
###52 or corporations were incredibly rich
###54 of course
###55 well out of the house i mean that's probably a portable right
###58 winning race one million six hundred eighty nine thousand five hundred and
###62 eighty dollars
###63 who's up on average the candidates who won
###66 raise that much money
###68 now where they got to get that money of course they're gonna get it for
###70 multinational corporations
###72 who become then
###73 the master of the house
###75 and by the way
###76 every if you work your atw he might be able to raise a from small donors
###81 but what do you think i a sinner centers in india
###83 made a hundred calls
###85 try to get a hundred dollars at a time
###87 really gonna make one call to a giant corporation is a
###91 help a brother out
###93 and you'll get it in return
###95 that's exactly what they're gonna do
###97 about already had that system citizen and have a report on steroids
###100 but back in two thousand eight
###102 leverage joining as senate seat was nine million to within one thousand
###106 my house was one million ford in seventy one thousand so yes is doubly getting
###110 worse right
###111 but those are joint numbers to begin with now to give you a sense again going
###115 back to twenty twelve numbers
###117 how much money they would have to raise
###120 every single day in two years
###123 to get to be able to get reelected if they were ready congress for example
###127 in the senate they would have to raise
###129 fourteen thousand three hundred and fifty one dollars
###133 every single day for two years
###136 now the congressional seats
###138 there are only four two years they lasts only two years
###141 and every day of those two years yet there is two thousand three hundred and
###145 fifteen dollars
###146 to be able to win
###147 so it's no wonder that they spend literally a majority of their time fifty
###152 to seventy percent of their time
###154 raising money
###155 not legislating not giving again about their constituents not meeting with
###159 their constituents
###160 not writing bills not doing research
###162 but raising money because that's the only thing that gives them elected
###167 this system is literally sick
###169 this corrupted to which cor
###171 it's not a democracy
###173 is by the rates for the rich
###175 and certainly all of the rich
###178 now we got to change the system entirely
###181 obviously you know but i think wolf bags the way to do that walt bash pack dot
###185 com
###186 and we do is to push for a constitutional amendment
###189 that takes away corporate person heard so they can spend unlimited money
###193 buying our politicians to legalized bribery
###196 that's exactly what this is
###198 and you actually
###199 do funding of elections publicly so there are the go begging for cash so we
###204 write their checks and they work for ops
###207 not for the big donors
###210 one more thing that's really important
###213 ralph nader uh... was
###215 gore and uh... different
###217 democrats and ask him hey listen
###219 why aren't you guys running tougher campaigns
###222 the republican party is an historic popularity
###225 lolz they were before the twenty twelve election
###228 you gotta run
###229 halfway populist campaigns in you wanted
###232 reich step
###234 why did you do that why did you win the house now of course a robot mo one they
###237 won the senate
###239 then biggest plan was to win twelve house-senate
###242 the answer twelve house seats back
###244 what that would know when the house back for them so they didn't even planning
###247 with the house back
###248 senator asked them
###250 and of course a lot of them he says given answers like well we had
###253 gerrymandered districts
###254 and uh...
###256 you know there was big money support for public as that's true decision are
###260 gerrymandered
###261 panorama is you have a ton of money
###263 but one high ranking democrat
###265 even the answer
###266 that is the most roofing and i have ever seen in politics
###269 he told him quote
###272 because we graze less money
###277 the reason the democrats
###280 run tough campaigns
###283 even more progressive campaigns against republicans
###286 is because they would then anger their corporate bosses
###290 indeed results money
###292 so if they were to tell the american people look at these corrupt republicans
###295 let me know they're taken money from
###297 mother who'd been doing favors from the they're working for the lobbyist in the
###301 special emphasis at our
###303 than those same one is a special interests and say how beer you know
###306 we're taking away your money
###307 and then you have no chance of winning
###311 you see that right there
###313 it's not democrats versus republicans as democrats and republicans verses us
###320 they can really go out for the republicans
###322 why
###324 because then they'd raise less money
###326 from the donors their all be holding two
###329 wall that packed up from
###331 become a member
###333 contribute volunteer do whatever you gotta do but we got it is a system
###337 position result was not a democracy
