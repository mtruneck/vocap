###2 Jacque Fresco - Dec. 19, 2010 "Relation to Academia" www.thevenusproject.com ・ Part 2
###5 What has to be done is - people should investigate the educational system of The Venus Project;
###14 what it offers. It must then look into the environmental aspects of The Venus Project. How we intend to support and
###23 restore the damaged environment. Then: what different types of vehicles would be used for transportation.
###31 How we solve the transportation problem. If they find shortcomings in it, say, "Present your recommendations."
###40 But don't say "I don't like that system." - Present your recommendations, or alternatives.
###46 If you want people to be safe in swimming, safe from sharks, you really don't have to make a swimming
###54 pool any deeper than 5ft. You can swim in 5ft of water. Its hard to drown if you can't make it, you can reach bottom.
###62 And children's pools will be shallow. And you can swim in it. You can't drown in it.
###68 It isn't that I like shallow pools. If children have difficulty, you can't always see it.
###75 I think our friends child drowned because mother couldn't watch over her in the ocean.
###82 And she blamed the old man, the old man blamed the mother for not watching, and then they both
###87 blamed the lifeguard. You know. It's inadequate systems: what you're dealing with.
###94 Do you understand?
###96 I don't find lifeguards submitting new ways of watching older people on the beach.
###101 They're always a lifeguard. They never seem to innovate; make a life preserver connected to a cable that
###108 goes out to the drowning person. That's what they need. Not the lifeguard grabbing him.
###114 They need the thing getting there faster. Lifeguard can only get there at a certain speed.
###119 So I would design a life raft that moves out very fast; stops by proximity mechanisms, and then moves
###125 slowly to the person so he can grab it. And if they can't grab it, you send human assistants on a vehicle
###133 out that way. Anyway, I've never heard of lifeguard associations making recommendations except
###142 binoculars for the lifeguard to look around. But limited, very limited. Lifeguards are not trained as innovators.
###151 But if you bring innovators to the system and say "How can you innovate that system to make it more efficient?"
###157 If a man is mechanical, he might make a life reserver connected to a cable.
###163 If he's electronic (into electronics), he would pick up distress in the water. You know, whatever it is.
###170 But I don't find Academia to be critical of a political system. I don't find many opinions coming forth
###179 on how to modify our system; so that we have less problems. I don't find that.
###186 Now in books on politics, I don't think George Washington would be surprised at the decision-making today.
###194 Cause its not that different. Benjamin Franklin, or anybody else. Our political system is based on opinions,
###203 projections, inadequacies, incompetence. That's why I say "They would feel at home in this society."
###214 But they would not feel at home in a Venus Project. No politician would know how decisions are made.
###220 They wouldn't understand why our schools are the way they are. They wouldn't; even if they came and visited
###226 the schools. They wouldn't understand. They wouldn't understand the nature of environmental reclamation.
###234 Why it's done. And they wouldn't understand where you get the money to do environmental reclamations.
###240 If the earth is declared common heritage, that's the only way you can have access to anything.
###246 I can't understand if you base all your decisions on "How much will it cost?" Well, you wouldn't do anything.
###254 Cause everything costs a lot of money. Except war. It makes a lot of money.
###259 It isn't that I want to direct the whole thing. I haven't gotten assistance from others on how to put
###266 up buildings faster. That were that new. So I had to innovate all this shit, cause I didn't get anything from others.
###276 I'm not interested in doing all that. I'd rather have people capable of knowing when they see a ship;
###283 "What is it you want?" - "You want the whole cargo unloaded at a given place." You don't want to take off
###289 one container at a time. That's okay, if different containers go different places. And you got one ship.
###296 But in the future, you must design automobile manufacturing at a certain region, so you deliver metals to that region.
###303 Not all over Detroit or wherever you have auto factories. You have automotive production in a given region.
###312 You know what I mean? With production lines. So you deliver more stuff; the same kind of stuff to all
###318 the auto producers. Cows and farming would be in a region with farming canning factories nearby.
###325 Not 50 miles away. Do you understand what I'm saying? I don't know any other system. I've never heard
###332 of a food producer that said "I'm going to open a cannery on my grounds so I can can the string beans."
###339 And besides, they wouldn't rot if they did that right away. I've never heard of an undertaker making recommendations
###348 for the use of usable organs before the burial. You know what I mean? A kidney, whatever it is, you can get.
###357 And you don't ask people whether or not they want to give their kidney after they're dead.
###361 They say "Oh, I wanna be buried whole." The Jews do not permit dissection.
###366 But the Jews won't ever know what the inside of the body is like if you don't permit dissection.
###376 You know what I mean? But people will die due to their belief systems. But, if you wanna go with that
###384 belief system. You can go, but I can assure you, you won't live as long as other systems.
###390 And if our system can't make the appropriate decisions, we'll be surpassed by China, or North Korea,
###397 or some other country that can make those decisions.
###400 I don't say they will. But we will be surpassed if we can't make the appropriate decision.
###407 So nature is a final eliminator, not Fresco. I don't eliminate people. If they're insufficiency is
###415 "Every man for himself." Than that society will run as long as evolution will permit it to run.
###423 You know, until the system is automated, and they fall on their face. That doesn't mean social change
###430 won't be made. It means people might die fighting each other. And killing each other. And riots because
###437 of different values; unless there is something put out there that people can understand.
###443 I think I could sell the package if not all the people, a great many people. Enough to influence them.
###451 Because they don't come there as an American to get them to accept our value system as the only one.
###458 And you don't attack their customs. You wait till evolution passes the need for customs of that kind.
###466 There are a group of Israeli's that are interested in The Venus Project. But if I went to Israel I'd
###471 be boo'd off a platform. The majority does not believe. Does not lean towards science. You know what I mean?
###479 So, I would try if I were invited, don't misunderstand me. If there were a big enough group in Israel,
###486 I would go there and talk to that group and tell them how to reach the other group.
###491 If I talk to the other group, I need three days, not a one-hour lecture.
###497 I never came up with ideas because academicians approved it. I came up with them to try to find a
###503 working solution. Academia doesn't know how to stop wars. Academia doesn't know hot to ask "What is the
###511 bomber for?" They don't seem to do that. That's why I don't respect them. If they understand my direction,
###518 that's more important than being a member of Academia.
###522 And people would say to me, are there any great people that accepted The Venus Project?
###528 There's something the matter with them; they have a low self-sufficiency. If the great man says "It's
###533 a good idea. They'll follow it." I don't want that kind of shit. Do you understand?
###539 If you say "Are there any famous people that accept The Venus Project?" Not that I know of.
###546 Because you would then go on if Einstein said it was okay. What about you?
###552 Roxanne: "Bill Gates..."
###553 If you understand what I'm talking about, you say its okay, even thought the world doesn't agree with you.
###558 The guys in the old days that believed the earth was round must have had a very rough time with Academia.
###565 I think it was Academia that burnt them. It's Academia today that can cut you off. That can say "That man's
###572 completely unqualified, never went to MIT, has no record of achievement in this world." - All true!
###580 But that doesn't mean anything. What means something is if people understand that if you don't take care
###587 of the environment, you lose it. That isn't difficult. But it may be "I guess the experts know what they're doing.
###595 Let's leave it to politicians. At least they know what they're doing." I don't believe they even know what
###601 they're doing. I don't believe they have the slightest idea what they're doing. I believe they're academicians
###608 that believe one opinion is as good as another.
