0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,13



2
0:0:0,13 --> 0:0:5,9
JOHN McAFEE: Mr. McAfee has been
arrested just across the


3
0:0:5,9 --> 0:0:8,0
border of Belize in the
country of Mexico.


4
0:0:8,0 --> 0:0:9,344
Write that down.


5
0:0:9,344 --> 0:0:11,28
-I'm calling in a tip
about John McAfee.


6
0:0:11,28 --> 0:0:17,88



7
0:0:17,88 --> 0:0:22,2
He got apprehended
in in Mexico.


8
0:0:22,2 --> 0:0:24,738
JOHN McAFEE: How many people
at the checkpoint?


9
0:0:24,738 --> 0:0:25,224
BDF?


10
0:0:25,224 --> 0:0:26,2
Police?


11
0:0:26,2 --> 0:0:28,326
I could walk in to the police
station, ask directions, and


12
0:0:28,326 --> 0:0:29,85
they would give me directions.


13
0:0:29,85 --> 0:0:31,69
Because you misdirect people.


14
0:0:31,69 --> 0:0:36,48



15
0:0:36,48 --> 0:0:39,14
JOHN McAFEE: I would never say
hang myself with my pants.


16
0:0:39,14 --> 0:0:39,95
How would you do that?


17
0:0:39,95 --> 0:0:43,52
I did say that lots of people
hang themselves, oddly enough,


18
0:0:43,52 --> 0:0:44,9
in Belizean jails.


19
0:0:44,9 --> 0:0:48,85
Mr. Henderson told the first
lawyer that I sent to ask for


20
0:0:48,85 --> 0:0:48,78
my guns back.


21
0:0:48,78 --> 0:0:52,12
He said, "If Mr. McAfee does
not like it here in Belize,


22
0:0:52,12 --> 0:0:54,25
why doesn't he leave?"


23
0:0:54,25 --> 0:2:54,25
