###9 EVAN TWYFORD: Three dimensional design for me was
###11 always kind of the greatest form of creation.
###14 Being able to take an idea from that very tiny amount of
###19 energy, being this idea in your head, and then
###22 formulating that into a fully functional
###24 three-dimensional product.
###25 Take that a step further, I always kind of wanted to
###28 design the ultimate three dimensional object, right?
###32 And so designing space vehicles, to me, was like that
###35 ultimate form of creation.
###37 It's like, what's the bad ass thing you could design would
###39 be a spaceship.
###40 And NASA really was kind of the final frontier for me.
###46 
###55 My name's Evan Twyford, and I'm a habitability designer at
###59 NASA's Johnson Space Center.
###60 
###66 We in our group do conceptual design for
###70 NASA's human space flight.
###72 A lot of these projects are coming down as major kind of
###77 campaign level design projects, where they're saying
###80 hey, we're doing a mission to the moon.
###82 We're working on a pressurized rover.
###85 We've got this idea, and we want you guys to
###87 help us make it happen.
###88 Starting off with sketching and rendering, very
###90 conceptual.
###91 Take it to a full scale mock up phase out of wood, foam
###97 core, low fidelity materials.
###99 We use those to kind of sketch out the volume of how big the
###102 vehicle might be, and how it would feel on the inside.
###105 Part of what we'll do when we're designing a habitat is
###108 we'll look at how the corners, how the edges are treated.
###112 What type of paint schemes are going to go inside.
###114 There was actually an issue with one of the colors that
###116 they had painted on the International Space Station,
###118 where one of the hatches was like a salmon color.
###121 And the crew really disliked it, so we try to
###124 avoid salmon now.
###127 And then working out the details in a CAD system on the
###129 computer, and developing a fully functional prototype.
###132 
###137 And the type of design at NASA that we do kind of crosses the
###140 line between fine art and engineering.
###143 So it's a lot more problem solving, though, which is what
###145 makes it really exciting.
###147 
###162 So this is the SEV, the Space Exploration Vehicle on the
###169 chassis, gen 1B.
###171 
###174 For interior design for space vehicles, there is certainly
###179 the problem of confinement, which is a psychological issue
###184 for crew members over time.
###185 So we have to deal with ways of designing environments and
###189 designing products that will reduce the effects of feelings
###195 of confinement in space.
###197 So this is the interior of the SEV rover gen 1B, and most of
###204 the interior design elements was a product of our team, as
###209 well the robotics team that we've been working with on
###212 this vehicle for some time.
###214 And we've kind of been charged with making the interior of
###217 the vehicle more comfortable, more luxurious, if you can
###221 call it that.
###223 
###230 Seeing as most of us haven't actually been to outer space,
###232 it can make things very difficult sometimes, because
###235 everybody has a different opinion, or different
###237 assumptions that they're making about what that
###239 experience is like.
###240 So it's a very testing and evaluation intensive work
###245 environment.
###245 So we have to do whatever we can to ensure that these
###249 products will work in their intended environment.
###251 So sometimes that means flying products, or mock ups on zero
###256 gravity flight in the parabolic aircraft.
###261 Sometimes it means going out into the desert and testing
###264 them in a very harsh, kind of desolate environment that
###269 might be similar to what we would encounter in space.
###271 
###279 There's always that kind of thing with designers between
###281 are you going to be like, a stylist, or are you going to
###283 be a problem solver?
###284 And you can look at a product and say this accomplishes
###290 exactly what we need it to accomplish, and that's what
###293 makes it beautiful, and that's what makes it successful.
###295 It's a very pure design problem that we're dealing
###299 with, which is to create products and environments that
###304 the crew will find useful, and will make them successful and
###309 productive in their daily routines.
###313 MALE SPEAKER: Go for main engine start.
###316 T-minus 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5--
###322 All three engines up and burning.
###325 2, 1, 0, and lift off.
###328 The final lift off of Atlantis.
###330 
###333 EVAN TWYFORD: The shuttle program and the International
###335 Space Station were started in the '80s as sort of a longer
###340 term analog for human space flight, and establishing a
###343 permanent human presence in space.
###345 To start to learn more about how humans would behave and
###350 interact in longer term space flight scenarios.
###353 
###362 I've kind of felt like a lot of people in general are maybe
###368 not as excited by the International Space Station,
###372 or by the shuttle program.
###373 Or at least not as much as they were maybe in the '80s,
###376 when the shuttle was brand new.
###378 I just hope that we can really re-engage people in the right
###382 way, and get people excited about space flight.
###385 Because this next generation of space vehicles is going to
###387 be the most bad ass that we've ever seen.
