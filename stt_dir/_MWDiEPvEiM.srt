[MUSIC PLAYING]


2
0:0:20,65 --> 0:0:23,29
TODD KOHLMAN: That's one of the
first early Burton signs


3
0:0:23,29 --> 0:0:25,49
that was on the Manchester
buildings.


4
0:0:25,49 --> 0:0:28,68
It's based off a shot, an actual
shot, of Jake from the


5
0:0:28,68 --> 0:0:31,1
'82 catalog.


6
0:0:31,1 --> 0:0:35,37
So here's a timeline on our
history here at Burton.


7
0:0:35,37 --> 0:0:38,2
As you know, it started
in 1977.


8
0:0:38,2 --> 0:0:42,28
Great early shot of Jake here
slashing some powder turns on


9
0:0:42,28 --> 0:0:45,34
a BB1 back [INAUDIBLE].


10
0:0:45,34 --> 0:0:49,1
Here, another great shot of
Jake getting some air--


11
0:0:49,1 --> 0:0:51,33
'78.


12
0:0:51,33 --> 0:0:54,14
Another one of Jake.


13
0:0:54,14 --> 0:0:56,26
JAKE BURTON CARPENTER: When I
started the company in '77,


14
0:0:56,26 --> 0:1:2,58
when I moved out of New York
City and came up here, I


15
0:1:2,58 --> 0:1:4,16
tooled up this factory--


16
0:1:4,16 --> 0:1:5,9
I had a good friend
and two relatives.


17
0:1:5,9 --> 0:1:8,8
And we got to where we could
make 50 boards a day and that


18
0:1:8,8 --> 0:1:8,7
was our objective.


19
0:1:8,7 --> 0:1:9,48
And that wasn't easy.


20
0:1:9,48 --> 0:1:11,795
It was tough, but we
figured it out.


21
0:1:11,795 --> 0:1:15,64
TODD KOHLMAN: Jake here in '81,
carving some boards--


22
0:1:15,64 --> 0:1:17,19
shaping, I should say.


23
0:1:17,19 --> 0:1:21,48
And Jake made 100 different
prototypes.


24
0:1:21,48 --> 0:1:25,63
It's amazing to think of his
passion before even coming up


25
0:1:25,63 --> 0:1:28,35
with the final product to
make 100 different ones.


26
0:1:28,35 --> 0:1:31,79
This is one of Jake's first
prototypes, and its


27
0:1:31,79 --> 0:1:33,75
interesting that it's
made of fiberglass.


28
0:1:33,75 --> 0:1:38,59
And he said it worked great in
powder, but he did say if you


29
0:1:38,59 --> 0:1:42,6
come across a rock, it just
blew the thing up.


30
0:1:42,6 --> 0:1:44,28
JAKE BURTON CARPENTER: So the
second year, we had already


31
0:1:44,28 --> 0:1:45,62
basically made enough boards.


32
0:1:45,62 --> 0:1:48,29
They were sort of pre-done, and
just had to be assembled.


33
0:1:48,29 --> 0:1:50,6
But nobody wanted them.


34
0:1:50,6 --> 0:1:53,15
So I went from myself plus three
full time employees, to


35
0:1:53,15 --> 0:1:57,13
basically myself plus one or two
high school kids working a


36
0:1:57,13 --> 0:1:58,6
little bit after school.


37
0:1:58,6 --> 0:2:1,0
So in other words, I had these
sort of bigger expectations,


38
0:2:1,0 --> 0:2:4,64
and then it just want way down
in terms of the whole scale of


39
0:2:4,64 --> 0:2:6,51
the company and the scale
of my expectations


40
0:2:6,51 --> 0:2:7,62
and everything else.


41
0:2:7,62 --> 0:2:9,284
That's probably what I'm
proudest of, looking back on


42
0:2:9,284 --> 0:2:12,86
everything, is just having the
perseverance to get through


43
0:2:12,86 --> 0:2:15,18
the whole thing.


44
0:2:15,18 --> 0:2:18,51
TODD KOHLMAN: In '81,
actually there was a


45
0:2:18,51 --> 0:2:19,41
change in the shape.


46
0:2:19,41 --> 0:2:25,93
They went from the narrow, maybe
Snurfer type, to this


47
0:2:25,93 --> 0:2:27,64
wide shape.


48
0:2:27,64 --> 0:2:29,57
It just changed the game--


49
0:2:29,57 --> 0:2:34,3
better float in the powder,
and just a better ride.


50
0:2:34,3 --> 0:2:36,65
JAKE BURTON CARPENTER: Those
boards were barely ride-able.


51
0:2:36,65 --> 0:2:40,15
But as a kid, I get a Snurfer,
which is a toy-like version of


52
0:2:40,15 --> 0:2:40,56
a snowboarder.


53
0:2:40,56 --> 0:2:42,65
It was much much
less expensive.


54
0:2:42,65 --> 0:2:43,79
But it was fun.


55
0:2:43,79 --> 0:2:45,44
There was no doubt about
it, and that's I


56
0:2:45,44 --> 0:2:48,7
pursued it with my life.


57
0:2:48,7 --> 0:2:51,59
And so I think once we get
boards out there, we got them


58
0:2:51,59 --> 0:2:54,55
to the right people and found
the right ways to advertise


59
0:2:54,55 --> 0:2:58,64
them, that's when it
just started to go.


60
0:2:58,64 --> 0:3:0,78
I mean, I think people
just had fun on them.


61
0:3:0,78 --> 0:3:4,9
DONNA CARPENTER: I met him at
a bar on New Year's Eve.


62
0:3:4,9 --> 0:3:8,5
I was up skiing at Stratton--


63
0:3:8,5 --> 0:3:11,49
so this is like 1981.


64
0:3:11,49 --> 0:3:12,58
I was living in New York.


65
0:3:12,58 --> 0:3:16,33
He said his name is Jake, and he
made snowboards, and nobody


66
0:3:16,33 --> 0:3:17,62
had ever heard of
snowboarding.


67
0:3:17,62 --> 0:3:22,99
And I said, whatever, I'm
way too sophisticated.


68
0:3:22,99 --> 0:3:25,15
The first date we had
that night I said,


69
0:3:25,15 --> 0:3:26,32
well let's try it.


70
0:3:26,32 --> 0:3:29,64
And it was just a wooden board
with a rope and a water-ski


71
0:3:29,64 --> 0:3:32,4
binding in the front, and a
strap in the back, and we wore


72
0:3:32,4 --> 0:3:35,2
high top sneakers.


73
0:3:35,2 --> 0:3:37,29
And I never thought I'd leave
New York for that, but I did.


74
0:3:37,29 --> 0:3:39,82



75
0:3:39,82 --> 0:3:41,27
TODD KOHLMAN: You put one of
these on there, that would


76
0:3:41,27 --> 0:3:44,6
help you keep the nose
up in powder.


77
0:3:44,6 --> 0:3:48,155
And notice, like I mentioned
before, the front binding is


78
0:3:48,155 --> 0:3:50,34
more like--


79
0:3:50,34 --> 0:3:53,5
it reminds me of water-ski
type bonding.


80
0:3:53,5 --> 0:3:58,43
And then back here, is just
like a strap that would go


81
0:3:58,43 --> 0:4:0,9
over your toes.


82
0:4:0,9 --> 0:4:2,83
And this is a BB1.


83
0:4:2,83 --> 0:4:5,58
And then the BB2 is a back-hill,
so it just


84
0:4:5,58 --> 0:4:8,54
basically was this without
the bondings.


85
0:4:8,54 --> 0:4:12,39
The super big change in '84--


86
0:4:12,39 --> 0:4:15,69
right in this area here, then
from here, we started doing


87
0:4:15,69 --> 0:4:17,279
P-Techs and metal edges.


88
0:4:17,279 --> 0:4:22,13
And so this Performer Elite
was pretty breakthrough--


89
0:4:22,13 --> 0:4:23,48
'85.


90
0:4:23,48 --> 0:4:25,85
Originally, I think Jake started
off riding in the


91
0:4:25,85 --> 0:4:27,0
backyard and stuff.


92
0:4:27,0 --> 0:4:32,13
I think it's just amazing how
far it's come from those days.


93
0:4:32,13 --> 0:4:35,77
PAT BRIDGES: Skiing and
snowboarding in the '80s was a


94
0:4:35,77 --> 0:4:36,79
scary place.


95
0:4:36,79 --> 0:4:39,45
Lawyers ruled the day.


96
0:4:39,45 --> 0:4:42,31
Introducing something new to
that environment was not


97
0:4:42,31 --> 0:4:48,94
welcome, and he took it upon
himself as a challenge, and he


98
0:4:48,94 --> 0:4:50,46
literally did the leg-work--


99
0:4:50,46 --> 0:4:52,97
went door to door and
sold our sport.


100
0:4:52,97 --> 0:4:53,98
Other people did too.


101
0:4:53,98 --> 0:4:56,4
I just don't think they
did it to his extent.


102
0:4:56,4 --> 0:4:58,3
Granted, you could question the
motivation, be like yeah,


103
0:4:58,3 --> 0:5:2,31
he's motivated by money, wants
to spread a sport.


104
0:5:2,31 --> 0:5:6,31
Well regardless of his
motivations, 20 years later


105
0:5:6,31 --> 0:5:7,99
there's 10 million snowboarders
in the United


106
0:5:7,99 --> 0:5:11,53
States who reap the
benefits of that.


107
0:5:11,53 --> 0:5:13,46
JAKE BURTON CARPENTER: We didn't
get on Stratton until


108
0:5:13,46 --> 0:5:16,67
'84, so I look back and it's
like, what the hell were we


109
0:5:16,67 --> 0:5:17,7
doing those first seven years?


110
0:5:17,7 --> 0:5:21,8
But we were hiking hills,
riding and stuff.


111
0:5:21,8 --> 0:5:25,11
So it took awhile before
we got on the resorts.


112
0:5:25,11 --> 0:5:30,5
And that was clearly a huge move
in terms of growing the


113
0:5:30,5 --> 0:5:31,89
whole thing and making
it bigger.


114
0:5:31,89 --> 0:5:34,18
But it took a long time
just to get there.


115
0:5:34,18 --> 0:5:35,95
DONNA CARPENTER: It was very
intense in the beginning.


116
0:5:35,95 --> 0:5:38,48
It was sort of 24/7.


117
0:5:38,48 --> 0:5:39,73
You never got away from it.


118
0:5:39,73 --> 0:5:44,1
It's not like you go home
from the office, and


119
0:5:44,1 --> 0:5:47,58
the problems go away.


120
0:5:47,58 --> 0:5:53,34
But there was never a time
when we would have really


121
0:5:53,34 --> 0:5:55,1
given it up.


122
0:5:55,1 --> 0:5:58,75
I think we were just passionate
about the sport.


123
0:5:58,75 --> 0:6:3,45
I think that we wanted to
see the sport grow.


124
0:6:3,45 --> 0:6:5,84
We wanted to see more ski
areas accept it, then we


125
0:6:5,84 --> 0:6:7,78
wanted to see it grow in Europe,
and then we wanted to


126
0:6:7,78 --> 0:6:9,52
see it grow in Asia.


127
0:6:9,52 --> 0:6:11,13
And now we're committed
to seeing the


128
0:6:11,13 --> 0:6:12,52
women's market grow.


129
0:6:12,52 --> 0:6:17,14
So there was always a challenge
ahead that had to do


130
0:6:17,14 --> 0:6:20,5
with getting more people into
the sport, which is what keeps


131
0:6:20,5 --> 0:6:21,75
us going I guess.


132
0:6:21,75 --> 0:6:29,98



133
0:6:29,98 --> 0:6:33,74
JAKE BURTON CARPENTER: And
there's Brush, Andy Coghlan,


134
0:6:33,74 --> 0:6:37,6
Neil Khan, and I think that's
Johan right there.


135
0:6:37,6 --> 0:6:41,58
And there's Ossie Loftus
right there.


136
0:6:41,58 --> 0:6:42,96
There's a classic Craig shot.


137
0:6:42,96 --> 0:6:44,46
That was a great era.


138
0:6:44,46 --> 0:6:47,34



139
0:6:47,34 --> 0:6:50,673
That was in Europe, and the
O'Neill outerwear thing was


140
0:6:50,673 --> 0:6:54,503
going off, and the colors were
just pretty fluorescent.


141
0:6:54,503 --> 0:6:57,48



142
0:6:57,48 --> 0:6:59,9
TREVOR ANDREW: Jake
is the man.


143
0:6:59,9 --> 0:7:1,67
He's one of the realest
people.


144
0:7:1,67 --> 0:7:4,83
The riders, to him,
he's always just


145
0:7:4,83 --> 0:7:6,12
considered them family.


146
0:7:6,12 --> 0:7:13,44
And since day one, he's not the
typical owner of a huge


147
0:7:13,44 --> 0:7:15,35
company like that, that
you would expect.


148
0:7:15,35 --> 0:7:19,57
He totally is like riding with
you and just as stoked as


149
0:7:19,57 --> 0:7:21,9
everybody else about it.


150
0:7:21,9 --> 0:7:22,92
He's not all business.


151
0:7:22,92 --> 0:7:26,59
He totally loves snowboarding,
and loves the team.


152
0:7:26,59 --> 0:7:28,0
And that's just his thing.


153
0:7:28,0 --> 0:7:32,1
He's just so into it, and I
guess that's what's brought


154
0:7:32,1 --> 0:7:35,59
him so much success, just
because he has genuine love


155
0:7:35,59 --> 0:7:37,17
for the sport.


156
0:7:37,17 --> 0:7:39,64
He's one of the pioneers.


157
0:7:39,64 --> 0:7:41,2
JEREMY JONES: His office
too is sick.


158
0:7:41,2 --> 0:7:44,35
You walk and it's
just couches--


159
0:7:44,35 --> 0:7:46,92
full chill, like hippie.


160
0:7:46,92 --> 0:7:47,72
It's dope.


161
0:7:47,72 --> 0:7:51,51
You walk in, and you're like,
this is your office dude?


162
0:7:51,51 --> 0:7:53,44
You make how much
money a year?


163
0:7:53,44 --> 0:7:55,32
This is sweet.


164
0:7:55,32 --> 0:7:56,4
Jump on the couch--


165
0:7:56,4 --> 0:7:58,61
it's all cushy and big
and throw your


166
0:7:58,61 --> 0:8:0,99
feet up on the table.


167
0:8:0,99 --> 0:8:2,28
He's doing the same.


168
0:8:2,28 --> 0:8:3,62
It's pretty sick--


169
0:8:3,62 --> 0:8:8,9
pretty sick that he's the
one that started it all.


170
0:8:8,9 --> 0:8:9,7
JAKE BURTON CARPENTER:
I think resisting the


171
0:8:9,7 --> 0:8:12,47
temptation to sell out--


172
0:8:12,47 --> 0:8:16,51
or whatever, or go public, or
cash out, or whatever--


173
0:8:16,51 --> 0:8:18,8
is probably the best thing
that we've done.


174
0:8:18,8 --> 0:8:20,37
If I were to point
to one thing, I


175
0:8:20,37 --> 0:8:22,1
think it would be that.


176
0:8:22,1 --> 0:8:24,15
KEIR DILLON: And you hear it
all the time, Burton's


177
0:8:24,15 --> 0:8:27,82
corporate, and it's crazy to
think that you're going to


178
0:8:27,82 --> 0:8:31,155
call the person that helped
pioneer the sport, fought to


179
0:8:31,155 --> 0:8:33,909
get it in the mountains, made
the R&D, invested so much


180
0:8:33,909 --> 0:8:35,98
money to bring it to where
it is, you're going


181
0:8:35,98 --> 0:8:36,96
to call them corporate.


182
0:8:36,96 --> 0:8:40,9
It's like the best case scenario
on the planet.


183
0:8:40,9 --> 0:8:41,99
The dude that pretty much
invented the sport--


184
0:8:41,99 --> 0:8:43,47
yeah, he's the corporate guy.


185
0:8:43,47 --> 0:8:44,4
It means he handled it.


186
0:8:44,4 --> 0:8:47,14
And you have a dude that cares
that much about snowboarding


187
0:8:47,14 --> 0:8:48,86
dictating where it goes.


188
0:8:48,86 --> 0:8:50,43
JAKE BURTON CARPENTER: We
haven't remotely come close to


189
0:8:50,43 --> 0:8:51,9
selling out.


190
0:8:51,9 --> 0:8:51,96
We're not public.


191
0:8:51,96 --> 0:8:54,87
We're privately held.


192
0:8:54,87 --> 0:8:56,95
My family-- we own
the whole deal.


193
0:8:56,95 --> 0:8:58,79
But we are big, and
we are successful.


194
0:8:58,79 --> 0:9:2,83
And being big, there's certain
limitations to that.


195
0:9:2,83 --> 0:9:4,66
But we try to move as
quickly as we can.


196
0:9:4,66 --> 0:9:8,34
We try to create fresh stuff and
always have part of what


197
0:9:8,34 --> 0:9:12,155
we're doing be very
forward thinking.


198
0:9:12,155 --> 0:9:17,5
But at the same time, have the
engineering backbone and


199
0:9:17,5 --> 0:9:21,5
functionality stuff that
we have so down.


200
0:9:21,5 --> 0:9:22,88
HANNAH TETER: He just wants the
best product, and that's


201
0:9:22,88 --> 0:9:24,11
we all want.


202
0:9:24,11 --> 0:9:27,26
That's why Burton is the
rider-driven company--


203
0:9:27,26 --> 0:9:29,72
because they're all about
input from us.


204
0:9:29,72 --> 0:9:31,35
They want it to look good,
but they want it to


205
0:9:31,35 --> 0:9:33,255
function more so.


206
0:9:33,255 --> 0:9:36,79
At first I was like,
wow, he's the boss.


207
0:9:36,79 --> 0:9:38,74
But he's just like a friend.


208
0:9:38,74 --> 0:9:42,37
He's just chill and a
down to Earth guy.


209
0:9:42,37 --> 0:9:44,47
It's nice to have a
boss like that.


210
0:9:44,47 --> 0:9:47,66
Not many people get nice
bosses, but we do.


211
0:9:47,66 --> 0:9:50,62
NILS MINDICH: Being the first
person we met from the family


212
0:9:50,62 --> 0:9:52,67
of the Carpenters was Taylor.


213
0:9:52,67 --> 0:9:54,67
He was about his
age in school.


214
0:9:54,67 --> 0:9:59,52
HANS MINDICH: His son, Taylor,
was pretty much him, Taylor,


215
0:9:59,52 --> 0:10:4,0
and then two other kids that
live near Jake's house--


216
0:10:4,0 --> 0:10:6,78
they're my three first
friends basically.


217
0:10:6,78 --> 0:10:9,41
And so my first sleepover
was actually at


218
0:10:9,41 --> 0:10:11,95
Jake's house, for one.


219
0:10:11,95 --> 0:10:15,74
So it's kind of like,
I've known him


220
0:10:15,74 --> 0:10:16,905
as a friend's father.


221
0:10:16,905 --> 0:10:18,64
NILS MINDICH: It's ironic.


222
0:10:18,64 --> 0:10:20,767
SHAUN WHITE: I don't know, I've
never really felt like he


223
0:10:20,767 --> 0:10:22,35
was a boss ever.


224
0:10:22,35 --> 0:10:25,25
It's been one of those things
where he's just like--


225
0:10:25,25 --> 0:10:27,365
I don't know if you've met him
or not-- but he's like this


226
0:10:27,365 --> 0:10:30,63
really mellow, fun guy.


227
0:10:30,63 --> 0:10:32,77
I think the first thing when we
were hanging out, he made


228
0:10:32,77 --> 0:10:36,3
some joke about what some
woman was wearing.


229
0:10:36,3 --> 0:10:38,7
And I was so blown away by it.


230
0:10:38,7 --> 0:10:40,33
It caught me so off guard,
I'm like this guy rules.


231
0:10:40,33 --> 0:10:41,58
He's all time.


232
0:10:41,58 --> 0:10:43,78



233
0:10:43,78 --> 0:10:45,84
YALE COUSINO: I've rode with
him a few times at Stowe.


234
0:10:45,84 --> 0:10:47,0
It was a storm.


235
0:10:47,0 --> 0:10:49,932
There was like two feet of fresh
snow, so it was pretty


236
0:10:49,932 --> 0:10:51,19
cool to ride powder with him.


237
0:10:51,19 --> 0:10:51,85
He shreds.


238
0:10:51,85 --> 0:10:52,716
For sure, he's good.


239
0:10:52,716 --> 0:10:54,97
He's real good.


240
0:10:54,97 --> 0:10:57,39
NICHOLAS MULLER: Who doesn't
dream to ride for Burton?


241
0:10:57,39 --> 0:11:0,46
And he starts to ride, and
it's the best company out


242
0:11:0,46 --> 0:11:5,476
there for the products, but
even more for the team.


243
0:11:5,476 --> 0:11:8,4
I mean, all the idols
that were there.


244
0:11:8,4 --> 0:11:11,95
Johan, [INAUDIBLE], and Terry.


245
0:11:11,95 --> 0:11:11,546
What makes the brand?


246
0:11:11,546 --> 0:11:13,99
You know, the team.


247
0:11:13,99 --> 0:11:17,26
JAKE BURTON CARPENTER: I hope
snowboarding keeps going and


248
0:11:17,26 --> 0:11:20,24
that the riders continue
to make more dough.


249
0:11:20,24 --> 0:11:22,16
It's weird in this country.


250
0:11:22,16 --> 0:11:25,31
Sports that people participate
in isn't necessarily where all


251
0:11:25,31 --> 0:11:26,74
the money is.


252
0:11:26,74 --> 0:11:30,36
Nobody's stopping snowboarders
from looking like NASCAR


253
0:11:30,36 --> 0:11:34,36
drivers, and putting patches
all over them, and selling


254
0:11:34,36 --> 0:11:36,3
themselves to everybody.


255
0:11:36,3 --> 0:11:38,43
That's not what people
want to see.


256
0:11:38,43 --> 0:11:39,36
And that's kind of good.


257
0:11:39,36 --> 0:11:44,4
There is this sort of sense of
couth that's associated with--


258
0:11:44,4 --> 0:11:45,94
I think all board sports--


259
0:11:45,94 --> 0:11:47,47
that we don't want to lose.


260
0:11:47,47 --> 0:11:53,11
And I think that might keep
things down a little bit


261
0:11:53,11 --> 0:11:56,97
smaller, but I think it's where
we all want to live in.


262
0:11:56,97 --> 0:11:59,23
We don't want to live in
that kind of world.


263
0:11:59,23 --> 0:12:1,29
So I think it'll continue to
grow, and it'll continue to


264
0:12:1,29 --> 0:12:6,55
get bigger, but it's going to
necessarily ever get to the


265
0:12:6,55 --> 0:12:10,76
point maybe where everybody is
such a big deal that they got


266
0:12:10,76 --> 0:12:13,25
to carry a gun and
stuff like that.


267
0:12:13,25 --> 0:12:16,86
Hopefully it'll just sort
of keep its scene.


268
0:12:16,86 --> 0:14:16,86
