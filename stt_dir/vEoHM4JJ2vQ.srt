2
0:0:2,19 --> 0:0:3,29
HARRY CHEADLE: Well, hello.


3
0:0:3,29 --> 0:0:5,92
I'm Harry, and I'm a loser.


4
0:0:5,92 --> 0:0:8,24
Growing up, I was one of those
weird kids who would play by


5
0:0:8,24 --> 0:0:11,5
the dumpsters at recess and ride
the school bus by myself.


6
0:0:11,5 --> 0:0:13,29
But now I live in Brooklyn.


7
0:0:13,29 --> 0:0:14,805
I have a real job at
a real magazine.


8
0:0:14,805 --> 0:0:17,43
I have a bank account and
a bunch of shirts.


9
0:0:17,43 --> 0:0:20,39
So I figure I can go back,
revisit some of my failures,


10
0:0:20,39 --> 0:0:21,61
and, with a little bit of luck,


11
0:0:21,61 --> 0:0:23,57
turn them into successes.


12
0:0:23,57 --> 0:0:24,93
This is "All Around Losing"
with Harry Cheadle.


13
0:0:24,93 --> 0:0:28,416



14
0:0:28,416 --> 0:0:31,16
You know how every youth soccer
team has that one weird


15
0:0:31,16 --> 0:0:33,42
kid who just kind of stands off
by himself and lets the


16
0:0:33,42 --> 0:0:34,98
ball go right past him?


17
0:0:34,98 --> 0:0:36,47
My whole team was those guys.


18
0:0:36,47 --> 0:0:38,41
There were a couple
guys named Carl.


19
0:0:38,41 --> 0:0:39,87
Prithvi, Prithvi Shankar.


20
0:0:39,87 --> 0:0:41,79
We could have won a math
championship with all the


21
0:0:41,79 --> 0:0:46,79
brains we had on my team, but,
running around, not so much.


22
0:0:46,79 --> 0:0:47,95
And I was part of the problem.


23
0:0:47,95 --> 0:0:51,2
In six years playing, I scored
exactly one goal, got hit in


24
0:0:51,2 --> 0:0:53,6
the nuts with a soccer ball more
times than I can count.


25
0:0:53,6 --> 0:0:54,99
Sometimes it would hit
me in the face.


26
0:0:54,99 --> 0:0:58,24
I feel kind of responsible for
a lot of the bad seasons we


27
0:0:58,24 --> 0:1:0,34
had, including the last
one, where we didn't


28
0:1:0,34 --> 0:1:3,57
win a single game.


29
0:1:3,57 --> 0:1:6,2
Now I've got a little bit more
self-confidence, better


30
0:1:6,2 --> 0:1:9,35
foot-eye coordination, so maybe
there's a chance I will


31
0:1:9,35 --> 0:1:12,7
actually be an all right
soccer player.


32
0:1:12,7 --> 0:1:14,2
But in order to not embarrass
myself, I'm going to need some


33
0:1:14,2 --> 0:1:16,936
coaching from an Austrian
named Gerhard.


34
0:1:16,936 --> 0:1:17,65
HARRY CHEADLE: Hey, Gerhard.


35
0:1:17,65 --> 0:1:17,99
GERHARD STOCHL: Hey.


36
0:1:17,99 --> 0:1:18,485
How are you?


37
0:1:18,485 --> 0:1:18,98
HARRY CHEADLE: I'm good.


38
0:1:18,98 --> 0:1:21,32
So the deal is, I'm trying
to get back into soccer.


39
0:1:21,32 --> 0:1:23,41
I haven't played in
like seven years.


40
0:1:23,41 --> 0:1:24,82
All I want to do is
impress people.


41
0:1:24,82 --> 0:1:25,15
GERHARD STOCHL: That exactly.


42
0:1:25,15 --> 0:1:26,71
HARRY CHEADLE: I don't
really care about--


43
0:1:26,71 --> 0:1:27,3
GERHARD STOCHL: Because
otherwise it


44
0:1:27,3 --> 0:1:28,26
will take 10 years.


45
0:1:28,26 --> 0:1:28,93
How long we got?


46
0:1:28,93 --> 0:1:30,93
A week?


47
0:1:30,93 --> 0:1:33,8
HARRY CHEADLE: Like a day.


48
0:1:33,8 --> 0:2:19,89
[MUSIC PLAYING]


49
0:2:19,89 --> 0:2:20,465
GERHARD STOCHL: I think
you did good.


50
0:2:20,465 --> 0:2:21,23
HARRY CHEADLE: Yeah?


51
0:2:21,23 --> 0:2:23,116
GERHARD STOCHL: You
got the juggling.


52
0:2:23,116 --> 0:2:24,62
HARRY CHEADLE: I kind
of like juggling.


53
0:2:24,62 --> 0:2:25,3
GERHARD STOCHL: Goalkeeping.


54
0:2:25,3 --> 0:2:26,52
Good penalties.


55
0:2:26,52 --> 0:2:28,77
Maybe a few push ups and--


56
0:2:28,77 --> 0:2:30,66
tonight, before the game.


57
0:2:30,66 --> 0:2:31,63
HARRY CHEADLE: OK.


58
0:2:31,63 --> 0:2:34,31
GERHARD STOCHL: And
you're ready.


59
0:2:34,31 --> 0:2:36,19
HARRY CHEADLE: I'm feeling
pretty nervous about this.


60
0:2:36,19 --> 0:2:39,5
I sat on my glasses this
morning when I woke up.


61
0:2:39,5 --> 0:2:40,4
My arm hurts for no reason.


62
0:2:40,4 --> 0:2:43,4
It's pretty cold.


63
0:2:43,4 --> 0:2:46,97
Practice with Gerhard went OK,
but actually playing a game is


64
0:2:46,97 --> 0:2:49,43
a lot different than just
kicking a ball around.


65
0:2:49,43 --> 0:2:52,3
So, these guys are probably
going to be a lot better than


66
0:2:52,3 --> 0:2:53,91
me, and I'll try not to
embarrass myself,


67
0:2:53,91 --> 0:2:56,68
but I always do.


68
0:2:56,68 --> 0:2:58,6
The first person
I met was Minh.


69
0:2:58,6 --> 0:3:0,39
Hey, Minh.


70
0:3:0,39 --> 0:3:3,69
Sort of an unofficial coach or
referee, or at least the guy


71
0:3:3,69 --> 0:3:5,5
who brings the jerseys.


72
0:3:5,5 --> 0:3:7,3
The other guys are
really friendly.


73
0:3:7,3 --> 0:3:7,82
I'm--


74
0:3:7,82 --> 0:3:9,15
MALE SPEAKER: Are those your
special soccer shoes?


75
0:3:9,15 --> 0:3:10,69
HARRY CHEADLE: They seem
supportive of my


76
0:3:10,69 --> 0:3:13,14
weird little mission.


77
0:3:13,14 --> 0:3:14,71
Wherever I can do the
least damage.


78
0:3:14,71 --> 0:3:15,44
MALE SPEAKER: Defense.


79
0:3:15,44 --> 0:3:15,63
HARRY CHEADLE: Defense?


80
0:3:15,63 --> 0:3:16,34
Yeah.


81
0:3:16,34 --> 0:3:18,14
And then, all of a sudden,
I was playing soccer.


82
0:3:18,14 --> 0:3:19,52
I've got no idea what
I'm doing here.


83
0:3:19,52 --> 0:3:22,76
I just was trying to follow my
man around a little bit and


84
0:3:22,76 --> 0:3:23,84
couldn't do that.


85
0:3:23,84 --> 0:3:25,46
Oh, that was probably
my fault.


86
0:3:25,46 --> 0:3:28,51
Sometimes I saw where I was
supposed to be way too late.


87
0:3:28,51 --> 0:3:29,27
Oh shit!


88
0:3:29,27 --> 0:3:32,7
Sometimes I'd get the ball,
purely by chance--


89
0:3:32,7 --> 0:3:33,34
it would just deflect off
of someone's foot-- and


90
0:3:33,34 --> 0:3:34,23
I had to kick it.


91
0:3:34,23 --> 0:3:38,245
And that was just totally
impossible.


92
0:3:38,245 --> 0:3:41,234
Oh shit!


93
0:3:41,234 --> 0:3:44,76
Not very well.


94
0:3:44,76 --> 0:3:46,11
A little winded.


95
0:3:46,11 --> 0:3:46,581
[INAUDIBLE]?


96
0:3:46,581 --> 0:3:47,523
Yeah.


97
0:3:47,523 --> 0:3:48,773
Yeah, sure.


98
0:3:48,773 --> 0:3:52,24



99
0:3:52,24 --> 0:3:52,9
It's tough to run around.


100
0:3:52,9 --> 0:3:55,11
I haven't run around like
that in a long time.


101
0:3:55,11 --> 0:3:57,19
No one was making fun of me
for being really bad.


102
0:3:57,19 --> 0:3:59,9



103
0:3:59,9 --> 0:4:1,25
Although I could tell they
didn't want to pass it to me.


104
0:4:1,25 --> 0:4:7,55



105
0:4:7,55 --> 0:4:9,306
I don't really know how this
works, but I'm too intimidated


106
0:4:9,306 --> 0:4:10,556
to ask questions.


107
0:4:10,556 --> 0:4:15,194



108
0:4:15,194 --> 0:4:18,736
Actually, the hard part was
running for half an hour, or


109
0:4:18,736 --> 0:4:21,44
45 minutes, or two days,
or whatever it was.


110
0:4:21,44 --> 0:4:25,825
Because I'm in really, really
bad shape, I realized.


111
0:4:25,825 --> 0:4:28,85
I've got to sit down,
actually.


112
0:4:28,85 --> 0:4:32,12
I was feeling pretty bad.


113
0:4:32,12 --> 0:4:33,8
I just met all these people.


114
0:4:33,8 --> 0:4:36,41
And my rule is don't throw
up in front of people


115
0:4:36,41 --> 0:4:39,46
you've just met, ever.


116
0:4:39,46 --> 0:4:42,6
And then a black guy started
talking, but I was also trying


117
0:4:42,6 --> 0:4:44,25
really hard not to throw
up at that point.


118
0:4:44,25 --> 0:4:46,92
MALE SPEAKER: How long
you haven't played?


119
0:4:46,92 --> 0:4:47,68
HARRY CHEADLE: Years.


120
0:4:47,68 --> 0:4:48,51
MALE SPEAKER: Really?


121
0:4:48,51 --> 0:4:50,8
HARRY CHEADLE: And then your
body's like, nope.


122
0:4:50,8 --> 0:4:51,33
This is coming up.


123
0:4:51,33 --> 0:4:55,43



124
0:4:55,43 --> 0:4:57,37
And I was like, oh, shit.


125
0:4:57,37 --> 0:4:59,8
I was trying not to puke
on anyone's bag.


126
0:4:59,8 --> 0:5:1,62
I succeeded in that, at least.


127
0:5:1,62 --> 0:5:3,36
I know how to puke probably
better than I


128
0:5:3,36 --> 0:5:4,25
know how to play soccer.


129
0:5:4,25 --> 0:5:4,81
MALE SPEAKER: That's
a good thing.


130
0:5:4,81 --> 0:5:5,225
HARRY CHEADLE: What?


131
0:5:5,225 --> 0:5:7,193
MALE SPEAKER: Once all
that's out, you're


132
0:5:7,193 --> 0:5:8,902
going to play better.


133
0:5:8,902 --> 0:5:9,71
HARRY CHEADLE: Oh, shit.


134
0:5:9,71 --> 0:5:10,96
And then I puked again.


135
0:5:10,96 --> 0:5:13,64



136
0:5:13,64 --> 0:5:14,89
HARRY CHEADLE: Jesus.


137
0:5:14,89 --> 0:5:20,28



138
0:5:20,28 --> 0:5:22,71
That's how my life
usually goes.


139
0:5:22,71 --> 0:5:25,18
I gave the guys some orange
slices, and I hope that kind


140
0:5:25,18 --> 0:5:26,42
of patched things up.


141
0:5:26,42 --> 0:5:29,63
I was like, here, not only did I
puke, but I brought you some


142
0:5:29,63 --> 0:5:30,21
vitamin C.


143
0:5:30,21 --> 0:5:32,1
Nothing like a good orange
slice, right?


144
0:5:32,1 --> 0:5:33,98
And I kept playing, at least.


145
0:5:33,98 --> 0:5:35,61
I'm glad I didn't bitch out.


146
0:5:35,61 --> 0:5:36,83
I did try to bitch out.


147
0:5:36,83 --> 0:5:37,814
MINH NGO: You only
played what?


148
0:5:37,814 --> 0:5:39,29
30 minutes?


149
0:5:39,29 --> 0:5:40,8
HARRY CHEADLE: I'm really
out of shape.


150
0:5:40,8 --> 0:5:41,32
MINH NGO: You have one
more game in you.


151
0:5:41,32 --> 0:5:41,71
HARRY CHEADLE: All right.


152
0:5:41,71 --> 0:5:42,69
One more.


153
0:5:42,69 --> 0:5:45,9
Even though I was bad, and I had
just thrown up, Minh was


154
0:5:45,9 --> 0:5:46,95
like, come on, get in
there and play.


155
0:5:46,95 --> 0:5:49,66
And that was nice.


156
0:5:49,66 --> 0:5:52,52
During the last play of that
game, no one was paying


157
0:5:52,52 --> 0:5:54,126
attention to me--


158
0:5:54,126 --> 0:5:55,76
probably for good reason.


159
0:5:55,76 --> 0:5:59,77
I got the ball, and I'm looking
at the goal, and I


160
0:5:59,77 --> 0:6:1,7
kicked the ball pretty hard--


161
0:6:1,7 --> 0:6:4,479



162
0:6:4,479 --> 0:6:5,729
Sorry.


163
0:6:5,729 --> 0:6:7,89



164
0:6:7,89 --> 0:6:10,68
It went right to the goalie,
but it was a shot on goal.


165
0:6:10,68 --> 0:6:12,97
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE],
just nail it in.


166
0:6:12,97 --> 0:6:14,149
HARRY CHEADLE: I probably would
have thrown up again if


167
0:6:14,149 --> 0:6:16,39
I had made that goal.


168
0:6:16,39 --> 0:6:21,22
I think this situation was about
a 70% failure, mostly


169
0:6:21,22 --> 0:6:23,95
because of the puking.


170
0:6:23,95 --> 0:6:25,86
Honestly, you don't feel good
when you puke in front of


171
0:6:25,86 --> 0:6:26,62
other people.


172
0:6:26,62 --> 0:6:27,33
I've lost this one.


173
0:6:27,33 --> 0:6:29,626
Just like I lost the ones
when I was a kid.


174
0:6:29,626 --> 0:6:30,542
Same feeling.


175
0:6:30,542 --> 0:6:31,35
Keep looking.


176
0:6:31,35 --> 0:6:32,55
Keep looking for redemption.


177
0:6:32,55 --> 0:6:34,43
And I guess that's what
I'm going to do.


178
0:6:34,43 --> 0:6:38,19



179
0:6:38,19 --> 0:6:40,0
It wasn't that bad out
there, though.


180
0:6:40,0 --> 0:6:41,22
Maybe I could--


181
0:6:41,22 --> 0:6:42,54
if I practiced--


182
0:6:42,54 --> 0:6:44,38
get a little better at
soccer, I think.


183
0:6:44,38 --> 0:6:47,49
But I'm not sure I will because,
honestly, I remember


184
0:6:47,49 --> 0:6:49,73
all those times, my favorite
part of the soccer game was


185
0:6:49,73 --> 0:6:51,29
when it's over.


186
0:6:51,29 --> 0:6:53,93
And you're in the car, and you
get to go home and take your


187
0:6:53,93 --> 0:6:55,52
shin guards off.


188
0:6:55,52 --> 0:6:59,3
So that's what I enjoyed most
about it, was stopping it.


189
0:6:59,3 --> 0:7:0,835
Is that good?


190
0:7:0,835 --> 0:7:1,31
MALE SPEAKER: No.


191
0:7:1,31 --> 0:7:2,56
Keep going.
