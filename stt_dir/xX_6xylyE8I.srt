0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:9,68



2
0:0:9,68 --> 0:0:11,78
JEFFREY BOUSSOLINI: I'm always
trying to think about that


3
0:0:11,78 --> 0:0:13,28
issue of the crazy cat lady.


4
0:0:13,28 --> 0:0:16,21
Because for one thing, I feel
like I'm right on the cusp of


5
0:0:16,21 --> 0:0:18,51
that myself.


6
0:0:18,51 --> 0:0:20,415
VANESSA GADBERRY: So my name
is Vanessa and this is


7
0:0:20,415 --> 0:0:21,98
Squirrel the kitten.


8
0:0:21,98 --> 0:0:23,7
She's deaf.


9
0:0:23,7 --> 0:0:26,34
She has to experience the world
by running up to things


10
0:0:26,34 --> 0:0:27,82
which also makes her
very dog-like.


11
0:0:27,82 --> 0:0:30,193
She's very curious and just has
to get into everything.


12
0:0:30,193 --> 0:0:33,57



13
0:0:33,57 --> 0:0:35,97
The hard thing about a deaf
cat is you can't call her.


14
0:0:35,97 --> 0:0:38,5
If she looks over, there's a
chance that she'll respond to


15
0:0:38,5 --> 0:0:40,54
the sign language I've
been teaching her.


16
0:0:40,54 --> 0:0:43,34
But otherwise, if she doesn't
look over, you're kind of SOL


17
0:0:43,34 --> 0:0:44,59
for getting her attention.


18
0:0:44,59 --> 0:0:49,93



19
0:0:49,93 --> 0:0:51,45
We go to a lot of events.


20
0:0:51,45 --> 0:0:53,67
We've gone to, pretty much,
every animal walk that the


21
0:0:53,67 --> 0:0:56,1
Twin Cities has had this year.


22
0:0:56,1 --> 0:0:58,31
We went to Pride and
walked in Pride.


23
0:0:58,31 --> 0:0:59,16
I loved it.


24
0:0:59,16 --> 0:0:59,88
It was amazing.


25
0:0:59,88 --> 0:1:1,78
Cats and gays, what
could be better?


26
0:1:1,78 --> 0:1:6,48
And I had decided after much
research to dye Squirrel's


27
0:1:6,48 --> 0:1:9,76
tail temporarily with some
organic food dye.


28
0:1:9,76 --> 0:1:11,24
I tried to get everyone that
took a picture and give them


29
0:1:11,24 --> 0:1:12,31
Squirrel's business card.


30
0:1:12,31 --> 0:1:13,63
Because I was like, I'd
really love to see


31
0:1:13,63 --> 0:1:14,66
the pictures online.


32
0:1:14,66 --> 0:1:17,75
We made them because we'd go
to events and people would


33
0:1:17,75 --> 0:1:19,2
want to like her Facebook.


34
0:1:19,2 --> 0:1:20,489
But I think ultimately they
just forgot by the


35
0:1:20,489 --> 0:1:21,63
time they got home.


36
0:1:21,63 --> 0:1:24,69
So we made a little takeaway
for them to remember.


37
0:1:24,69 --> 0:1:27,44
And the photos have already
started being posted to her


38
0:1:27,44 --> 0:1:29,42
Facebook fan page.


39
0:1:29,42 --> 0:1:32,42
-She was running around at
the festival last night?


40
0:1:32,42 --> 0:1:33,275
VANESSA GADBERRY: She's
doing great.


41
0:1:33,275 --> 0:1:35,61
-Could you tell us a little
bit about that experience?


42
0:1:35,61 --> 0:1:36,59
VANESSA GADBERRY:
It was amazing.


43
0:1:36,59 --> 0:1:38,31
I've seen all the
videos already.


44
0:1:38,31 --> 0:1:40,0
I was like, oh, once we
start the videos I


45
0:1:40,0 --> 0:1:40,86
might be kind of bored.


46
0:1:40,86 --> 0:1:43,12
Because I watch cat
videos for hours.


47
0:1:43,12 --> 0:1:43,65
Like I could--


48
0:1:43,65 --> 0:1:44,14
-Hours?


49
0:1:44,14 --> 0:1:46,25
VANESSA GADBERRY: --reanact
some of them probably.


50
0:1:46,25 --> 0:1:48,53
It was awesome, because there
was actually videos I haven't


51
0:1:48,53 --> 0:1:49,53
seen before.


52
0:1:49,53 --> 0:1:53,22
And it was amazing that YouTube
cats celebrities were


53
0:1:53,22 --> 0:1:56,31
flown in and traveled, and I
wasn't expecting that at all.


54
0:1:56,31 --> 0:1:59,34
We got pictures with Squirrel
and Lil' Bub together.


55
0:1:59,34 --> 0:2:2,65
But we also met the little girl,
who is now grown up, who


56
0:2:2,65 --> 0:2:4,95
narrated Kittens Inspired
by Kittens.


57
0:2:4,95 --> 0:2:8,0
And personally, that YouTube
video changed my life.


58
0:2:8,0 --> 0:2:11,31
-Kittens inspired by kittens.


59
0:2:11,31 --> 0:2:12,705
VANESSA GADBERRY: Bub's
owner was super chill.


60
0:2:12,705 --> 0:2:12,97
-Yeah?


61
0:2:12,97 --> 0:2:14,42
VANESSA GADBERRY: He
was awesome, yeah.


62
0:2:14,42 --> 0:2:16,972
Guys are sexy that like
animals and know


63
0:2:16,972 --> 0:2:20,26
how to treat animals.


64
0:2:20,26 --> 0:2:22,44
I feel like you can't
trust someone who


65
0:2:22,44 --> 0:2:23,2
doesn't like animals.


66
0:2:23,2 --> 0:2:24,68
Who doesn't like animals?


67
0:2:24,68 --> 0:2:36,436
-[SINGING]


68
0:2:36,436 --> 0:2:37,53
RO: I'm Ro.


69
0:2:37,53 --> 0:2:39,15
KAI: I'm Kai.


70
0:2:39,15 --> 0:2:40,3
RO: These are our cats.


71
0:2:40,3 --> 0:2:41,95
This is Artemis.


72
0:2:41,95 --> 0:2:43,2
He's our newest cat.


73
0:2:43,2 --> 0:2:44,65
He's about a year old.


74
0:2:44,65 --> 0:2:47,93
Artemis is like the brave little
boy, and he'll get in


75
0:2:47,93 --> 0:2:49,44
all the adventures.


76
0:2:49,44 --> 0:2:51,45
KAI: Arlo is this
one down here.


77
0:2:51,45 --> 0:2:51,94
RO: I didn't introduce Arlo.


78
0:2:51,94 --> 0:2:53,22
KAI: He doesn't really
care about anything.


79
0:2:53,22 --> 0:2:56,66
RO: That's if you hit her but
really hard a bunch or like


80
0:2:56,66 --> 0:2:58,82
grab her fat on her tummy
and go like this.


81
0:2:58,82 --> 0:3:0,23
This is Lucian.


82
0:3:0,23 --> 0:3:3,42
He's Siamese mix and
he's two years old.


83
0:3:3,42 --> 0:3:7,12
And he knows how to sit, and he
has freckles and the most


84
0:3:7,12 --> 0:3:8,36
beautiful eyes.


85
0:3:8,36 --> 0:3:10,21
Oh, and Lucian gives kisses.


86
0:3:10,21 --> 0:3:12,3
KAI: Eww, it's going
to be salty.


87
0:3:12,3 --> 0:3:16,35



88
0:3:16,35 --> 0:3:19,32
RO: I think my first favorite
one is the one where the


89
0:3:19,32 --> 0:3:21,835
kitten's sliding down and the
mom goes and gets him.


90
0:3:21,835 --> 0:3:27,73



91
0:3:27,73 --> 0:3:31,86
OK, my next favorite is that one
with the cat attacking the


92
0:3:31,86 --> 0:3:33,11
automatic feeder.


93
0:3:33,11 --> 0:3:36,716



94
0:3:36,716 --> 0:3:37,71
Have you seen that?


95
0:3:37,71 --> 0:3:40,1
It's so funny.


96
0:3:40,1 --> 0:3:42,97
KAI: I really like the one they
played last night where


97
0:3:42,97 --> 0:3:45,6
she's going behind the wall, and
then every time she comes


98
0:3:45,6 --> 0:3:46,52
back she sees the cat
closer to her.


99
0:3:46,52 --> 0:3:47,8
I think that one is
really funny.


100
0:3:47,8 --> 0:4:5,11



101
0:4:5,11 --> 0:4:7,5
RO: And for Halloween, they're
going to be the four different


102
0:4:7,5 --> 0:4:9,39
houses from Hogwarts.


103
0:4:9,39 --> 0:4:11,52
Lucian's going to be Slytherin
because he, kind of, looks


104
0:4:11,52 --> 0:4:12,25
like Malfoy.


105
0:4:12,25 --> 0:4:13,57
KAI: I don't know Harry
Potter very well.


106
0:4:13,57 --> 0:4:16,14
I just know the cats.


107
0:4:16,14 --> 0:4:16,621
RO: Dimitri.


108
0:4:16,621 --> 0:4:18,64
KAI: Oh, no.


109
0:4:18,64 --> 0:4:20,469
RO: Oh, no.


110
0:4:20,469 --> 0:4:22,88
That's another part
of having cats.


111
0:4:22,88 --> 0:4:25,686
It's not all fun and games.


112
0:4:25,686 --> 0:4:27,75
KAI: Oh, baby.


113
0:4:27,75 --> 0:4:28,27
RO: Will you get it?


114
0:4:28,27 --> 0:4:28,69
KAI: Yeah.


115
0:4:28,69 --> 0:4:30,76
We don't have any
paper towels.


116
0:4:30,76 --> 0:4:32,84
RO: Oh, there's like, ewww.


117
0:4:32,84 --> 0:4:34,8
Oh, God.


118
0:4:34,8 --> 0:4:38,11
WHITNEY ROGERS: My name is
Whitney Rogers, and I got Pax


119
0:4:38,11 --> 0:4:42,23
last August so about a year
ago, a little bit over.


120
0:4:42,23 --> 0:4:46,77
And I got her from a local
breeder in St. Louis Park.


121
0:4:46,77 --> 0:4:48,9
-Did you want a Rex?


122
0:4:48,9 --> 0:4:49,57
WHITNEY ROGERS: Very
specifically.


123
0:4:49,57 --> 0:4:52,53
They have a very low shedding,
they don't shed


124
0:4:52,53 --> 0:4:53,41
very much at all.


125
0:4:53,41 --> 0:4:56,79
You can bathe them which will
cut down even more.


126
0:4:56,79 --> 0:4:59,37
But they're very good for
people with allergies.


127
0:4:59,37 --> 0:5:0,96
They have a very long life.


128
0:5:0,96 --> 0:5:4,94
It's a relatively new breed
so they don't have high


129
0:5:4,94 --> 0:5:8,5
incidences of any kind of
disease or inherent health


130
0:5:8,5 --> 0:5:10,29
problems either.


131
0:5:10,29 --> 0:5:14,0
And once I got her, I
was totally hooked.


132
0:5:14,0 --> 0:5:18,96
She is quite possibly
the funniest.


133
0:5:18,96 --> 0:5:21,77
And I like it because Kittles
will pretty much just watch.


134
0:5:21,77 --> 0:5:23,85
I try to film her sometimes.


135
0:5:23,85 --> 0:5:26,2
We've got a couple funny
films of her.


136
0:5:26,2 --> 0:5:30,2
But it's hard, because I try
to get my boyfriend to put


137
0:5:30,2 --> 0:5:34,35
them online, and he thinks the
whole thing is kind of hmm.


138
0:5:34,35 --> 0:5:36,67
I think he just doesn't want
to admit how much of a cat


139
0:5:36,67 --> 0:5:40,89
person he is, because he tries
to be a little bit tougher


140
0:5:40,89 --> 0:5:43,61
than he is at home.


141
0:5:43,61 --> 0:5:47,5
Even though they say this cat's
really high energy, you


142
0:5:47,5 --> 0:5:50,34
might not realize that she will
climb you and jump on


143
0:5:50,34 --> 0:5:52,1
your shoulders regardless
of what you're


144
0:5:52,1 --> 0:5:54,62
wearing or not wearing.


145
0:5:54,62 --> 0:5:57,68
And she'll like to sit up there,
and sometimes they lose


146
0:5:57,68 --> 0:5:58,4
their balance.


147
0:5:58,4 --> 0:6:2,37
It can be a slippery
slope really.


148
0:6:2,37 --> 0:6:4,99
And be prepared to
get some scars.


149
0:6:4,99 --> 0:6:7,54
She definitely is getting
more notoriety.


150
0:6:7,54 --> 0:6:10,69
A lot of my friends know about
her, and we'll take pictures


151
0:6:10,69 --> 0:6:15,7
and post them on Instagram and
at least tell me about it so I


152
0:6:15,7 --> 0:6:17,98
can tag myself in it.


153
0:6:17,98 --> 0:6:19,89
A few of his friends that came
over were like, this is the


154
0:6:19,89 --> 0:6:23,89
weirdest cat we've ever seen
in our entire lives.


155
0:6:23,89 --> 0:6:28,55
She just looks so strange with
that huge head and huge ears.


156
0:6:28,55 --> 0:6:32,74
I have written two or three
songs about cats, only one


157
0:6:32,74 --> 0:6:34,43
since I've gotten her though.


158
0:6:34,43 --> 0:6:37,28
My band has a curse word
in the name so--


159
0:6:37,28 --> 0:6:38,18
-What's the name?


160
0:6:38,18 --> 0:6:40,66
WHITNEY ROGERS: It's Shit
Beast Kitchen Club.


161
0:6:40,66 --> 0:6:44,7
And we've been doing stuff
for a really long time.


162
0:6:44,7 --> 0:6:46,66
Yeah, this is me like three
or four years ago.


163
0:6:46,66 --> 0:6:55,786



164
0:6:55,786 --> 0:6:58,55
This was before we figured out
how to work most of the stuff


165
0:6:58,55 --> 0:7:0,19
in the studio also.


166
0:7:0,19 --> 0:7:7,47



167
0:7:7,47 --> 0:7:8,72
I'm pretty proud of it.


168
0:7:8,72 --> 0:7:11,77



169
0:7:11,77 --> 0:7:14,11
-How high can she jump?


170
0:7:14,11 --> 0:7:16,5
WHITNEY ROGERS: I'd say
about between five


171
0:7:16,5 --> 0:7:18,78
and six feet or so.


172
0:7:18,78 --> 0:7:21,44
I'd say, pretty much, four and
a half to five is, sort of,


173
0:7:21,44 --> 0:7:23,78
her average.


174
0:7:23,78 --> 0:7:27,43
Most of the cat videos that are
on the internet are pretty


175
0:7:27,43 --> 0:7:32,35
funny or have some intrinsic
entertainment value to them


176
0:7:32,35 --> 0:7:37,16
but also raise more awareness
about rarer breeds, care,


177
0:7:37,16 --> 0:7:41,72
troubleshooting any possible
problems your cats might have,


178
0:7:41,72 --> 0:7:45,86
and, sort of, parenting
almost.


179
0:7:45,86 --> 0:7:47,955
I really love cats.


180
0:7:47,955 --> 0:9:47,955
