###0 RASHAD EVANS: You know, there's not one fighter that
###1 fights exactly alike.
###2 Even though they may look like it, they're still-- the
###5 expression is different, because your personality
###7 comes out in it.
###9 A side of me comes out when I'm competing, that in real
###12 life, I'm not like that.
###15 When I compete, I'm cocky sometimes.
###17 I'm arrogant.
###19 But that's not for the fans at home.
###21 That's for my opponent.
###23 I don't fight to prove that I'm tough.
###24 I already know I'm tough.
###28 I fight because it's inside of me.
###32 We all are fighters.
###33 Every single person who walks this earth is a fighter.
###37 Everything that lives--
###39 to live is to fight, and we just fight
###43 in different arenas.
###45 
###55 Uh oh.
###55 It's in the water.
###58 He ain't jumping in the water, I tell you that.
###62 You want the ball?
###62 Want the ball, huh?
###62 Go get it.
###64 Go get it, get it, get it.
###68 Man, you're slow.
###70 You're slow!
###72 I'm always afraid before I compete.
###73 Before I fight, I'm always afraid.
###76 I'm always like that.
###79 That feeling.
###80 And before, I used to have a hard time just dealing with
###85 it, because I would try to run away from it.
###87 But then as I competed more, I understood the fact that this
###91 is how I'm supposed to feel.
###94 The biggest thing for me whenever I compete, accept it.
###99 I used to have a sports-- like in GSP, we used to
###102 use the same one.
###104 And he used to have this drill that we used to do.
###108 And we would stand in the mirror and just say, I don't
###112 give a fuck.
###114 And just say that over and over again, until you really
###117 start to really feel it inside, like I
###121 don't give a fuck.
###122 And when you're saying that, you really sound like, I don't
###125 give a fuck if I get laughed at.
###127 I don't give a fuck if I get knocked out in one second.
###129 I don't give a fuck if it's the worst fight I've ever had.
###133 I don't give a fuck.
###134 And then once you start breaking down all those
###137 things, all those feelings, all those fears that you may
###139 have that becomes barriers, that becomes the red lights,
###142 that becomes the thing that keeps you from competing at
###145 your best, then you're able to just free
###149 yourself and just go.
###150 
###154 HENRI HOOFT: Rashad, everybody knows Rashad, of course.
###156 He started this.
###157 Rashad is just--
###158 he's so funny.
###159 He's never really down.
###161 He's had a lot of stuff going on in the last year, with a
###163 lot of personal stuff, but he still always smiles, brings
###166 his good stuff, good energy to the gym.
###168 Especially at this moment, when he's right before the
###169 fight with [INAUDIBLE], he has a good vibe, good energy.
###173 And Rashad's very good, you know, in his role as one of
###175 the mentors of the gym and one of the fighters.
###178 
###185 RASHAD EVANS: Growing up, I was, like, a crazy kid.
###188 Lot of energy, always wrestling, always fighting.
###191 I grew up in Niagara Falls, New York.
###194 It was fun there.
###195 You had the Falls there and everything else.
###197 Growing up, I played football, I wrestled, and I even ran
###200 track a little bit.
###201 But my last high school football game, we were in the
###204 semis in the playoffs, and my team lost.
###207 It kind of struck a chord in me, because no matter how good
###210 of a game I had, I still didn't win the game.
###214 And I didn't want to do it anymore, because I was like,
###216 if I'm going to lose, I want it to be on me.
###219 I want to be the one who's holding the blame for losing.
###222 I don't want to doubt my teammates or anything else
###228 like that, because they didn't come through on their end.
###230 And I was like, you know, when I lose, I want to lose for me.
###233 HENRI HOOFT: It's not normal how strong he is, how fast.
###236 He already did very good, of course.
###237 He was a champion.
###238 But we want to see him, like, bang, like the old days.
###241 Just go out there and just, don't care.
###243 Just go.
###243 Just do it.
###245 
###250 RASHAD EVANS: The first time I stepped into the cage, it was
###252 like a rush that I never felt before.
###254 It was a different kind of excitement, because it was
###257 married with fear, and it was something I'd never had as a
###260 competitor before.
###261 Because even as a wrestler, no matter how big the stage was,
###264 I still never had that fear like you do
###269 when you have a fight.
###270 I found comfort in just playing around and joking, and
###276 that helped me relax a little more.
###278 But the first time I stepped in the cage, it was like, wow,
###282 this is going down.
###284 HENRI HOOFT: Rashad is like a character, man.
###285 I mean, you see him, he's smiling, he's making fun.
###288 But Rashad, when he's here, he works hard.
###290 He works hard, and he does what he needs to do, you know?
###292 We like to train hard, and we hit hard, but we still smile.
###295 You know, if you knock somebody out, knock somebody
###297 down, have somebody in a choke, you still smile after
###299 it, you know?
###300 You work together.
###300 And Rashad is just a good guy with that.
###302 RASHAD EVANS: You know, I've heard some people say, oh,
###306 he's made it.
###307 And whatever that means.
###309 But I understand the concept behind what they're saying.
###311 What they're saying is that he's known.
###313 He's been around in the game.
###315 He's been in the fight game for a while.
###316 And being in the fight game for a while is a feat in
###319 itself, especially seeing how short a window fighters have.
###323 So a lot of guys, they respect that, and
###325 they give me the respect.
###326 I am a student.
###327 I am a student of whoever I can learn from.
###331 I don't see myself in a position like, oh, I'm above
###335 anybody else, and I can never learn, or no one can ever
###339 teach me anything.
###339 Because you learn a lot from guys who are just
###343 starting off sometimes.
###345 And sometimes, when you've been in the game for a long
###347 time, and you've seen a lot, it's good to get a fresh sense
###355 of fresh energy from somebody, because somebody may come in
###358 who hasn't been in the game for a long time, who's just
###361 got an energy about them.
###364 That's one thing about John Jones that I like most about
###367 training with him.
###368 He was my favorite training partner to train with, because
###371 he helped me be more creative.
###373 Because when I was training with him, he would always do
###378 something out of the box.
###380 And he didn't really have any fear yet.
###383 He wasn't really afraid, so he would just do
###385 whatever he would do.
###386 And it would work, because people wouldn't expect it,
###390 because it's not typically what you would do.
###391 But that's what made him great, and that's why I liked
###394 training with him, because it was like one of those things
###396 where you see somebody with a fresh new look
###399 on things, you know?
###401 And that's what some of these guys got coming in.
###404 They've got a fresh look on things.
###408 HENRI HOOFT: People are only going to talk with you when
###410 you're open for it.
###412 He's open.
###412 He talks with everybody about everything, you know?
###415 Never comes into problems, never has problems, never has
###417 problems with people here.
###418 He's a very cool guy.
###419 Very relaxed, laid down.
###421 Again, a good mentor for young kids.
###423 They look up to him.
###423 But they don't really need to look up to him, because he's
###425 here, training with them, doing just normal.
###427 I mean, he has nothing to do with stardom or something.
###430 He knows he's just a fighter.
###431 And I know from my own experience--
###432 I mean, I was a champion, too-- it takes
###434 a very short time.
###435 A long time to get there, but a very short time to fall
###438 down, and nobody cares about you anymore.
###439 And he sees that.
###440 He's just normal with the guys.
###442 Doesn't really matter.
###445 RASHAD EVANS: To compete against me is a mistake.
###447 He shouldn't be in a cage with me, even though I may respect
###450 him immensely.
###451 And that's my mindset when I compete, because for one
###454 second if I give him too much respect, then he's already
###457 raising his leg on me, and I can't be pissed on.
###461 I refuse.
###462 I piss on people.
###463 I don't get pissed on.
###465 And that's gotta be my mindset.
###467 But that's different than me in real life.
###470 In real life, I'm passive.
###471 I'm calm.
###472 I don't get upset a lot.
###475 I'm a nice person.
###476 But when I compete, it's a different thing.
###479 It's a different expression.
###480 I always want to be around the sport, rather than just being
###484 an MMA analyst, or rather helping out guys on the team,
###490 I always want to be part of the sport.
###492 This sport has done amazing things for me.
###495 If I couldn't laugh, I couldn't smile, if I couldn't
###497 have jokes with my friends, then there'd
###500 be no sense of living.
###500 So for me, that makes me enjoy life more.
###504 That makes me enjoy practice more.
###506 That makes me enjoy this time that we have with each other,
###509 because that's what it's about, man.
###511 Life is celebration.
###512 The fact that I was able to get up and train in the
###514 morning, and the fact that I was able to train and sweat
###516 and be able to do this and get this grind in with these guys,
###520 that's a blessing.
###522 That right there is a celebration.
###523 One day, these will just be memories that I have.
###525 And one day, I'll be too old to do it, and I'm going to
###529 wish that I enjoyed it more.
###531 So I try to enjoy it as much as possible.
###532
