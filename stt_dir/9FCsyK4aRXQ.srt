1
0:0:13,918 --> 0:0:16,862
My story begins in Zimbabwe


2
0:0:16,862 --> 0:0:19,397
with a brave park ranger named Orpheus


3
0:0:19,397 --> 0:0:22,522
and an injured buffalo.


4
0:0:22,522 --> 0:0:26,781
And Orpheus looked at the buffalo
on the ground, and he looked at me,


5
0:0:26,781 --> 0:0:31,146
and as our eyes met, there was an unspoken grief 
between the three of us.


6
0:0:31,146 --> 0:0:35,901
She was a beautifully wild and innocent creature,


7
0:0:35,901 --> 0:0:42,79
and Orpheus lifted the muzzle
of his rifle to her ear. (Gunshot)


8
0:0:42,79 --> 0:0:46,896
And at that moment,
she started to give birth.


9
0:0:46,896 --> 0:0:51,296
As life slipped from the premature calf, 
we examined the injuries.


10
0:0:51,296 --> 0:0:55,822
Her back leg had been caught 
in an eight-strand wire snare.


11
0:0:55,822 --> 0:0:58,995
She'd fought for freedom 
[for] so hard and so long


12
0:0:58,995 --> 0:1:2,168
that she'd ripped her pelvis in half.


13
0:1:2,168 --> 0:1:5,421
Well, she was finally free.


14
0:1:5,421 --> 0:1:9,415
Ladies and gentlemen, today I feel 
a great sense of responsibility


15
0:1:9,415 --> 0:1:14,366
in speaking to you 
on behalf of those that never could.


16
0:1:14,366 --> 0:1:20,826
Their suffering is my grief,
is my motivation.


17
0:1:20,826 --> 0:1:25,62
Martin Luther King best summarises 
my call to arms here today.


18
0:1:25,62 --> 0:1:29,539
He said, "There comes a time 
when one must take a position that's neither safe,


19
0:1:29,539 --> 0:1:32,371
nor politic, nor popular.


20
0:1:32,371 --> 0:1:38,114
But he must take that position 
because his conscience tells him that it's right."


21
0:1:38,114 --> 0:1:43,154
Because his conscience
tells him it is right.


22
0:1:43,154 --> 0:1:46,422
At the end of this talk 
I'm gonna ask you all a question.


23
0:1:46,422 --> 0:1:48,898
That question is the only reason
I traveled here today


24
0:1:48,898 --> 0:1:51,374
all the way from the African savanna.


25
0:1:51,374 --> 0:1:54,157
That question for me has cleansed my soul.


26
0:1:54,157 --> 0:1:59,4
How you answer that question 
will always be yours.


27
0:1:59,4 --> 0:2:2,341
I remember watching the movie 
The Wizard of Oz as a young kid,


28
0:2:2,341 --> 0:2:6,313
and I was never scared of the witch 
or the flying monkeys.


29
0:2:6,313 --> 0:2:11,359
My greatest fear was that I'd grow up
like the Lion, without courage.


30
0:2:11,359 --> 0:2:15,445
And I grew up always asking myself 
if I thought I'd be brave?


31
0:2:15,445 --> 0:2:19,305
Well, years after Dorothy 
had made her way back to Kansas,


32
0:2:19,305 --> 0:2:21,135
and the Lion had found his courage,


33
0:2:21,135 --> 0:2:23,981
I walked into a tattoo parlor 
and had the words


34
0:2:23,981 --> 0:2:27,622
'Seek and Destroy' tattooed
across my chest.


35
0:2:27,622 --> 0:2:30,661
And I thought that'd make me
big and brave.


36
0:2:30,661 --> 0:2:33,94
But it'd take me almost a decade 
to grow into those words.


37
0:2:33,94 --> 0:2:37,184
By the age of 20 I'd become 
a clearance diver in the navy.


38
0:2:37,184 --> 0:2:40,817
By 25, as a special operations sniper,


39
0:2:40,817 --> 0:2:44,564
I knew exactly how many clicks of elevation 
I needed on the scope of my rifle


40
0:2:44,564 --> 0:2:48,899
to take a headshot on a moving target 
from 700m away.


41
0:2:48,899 --> 0:2:51,541
I knew exactly how many grams 
of high explosives it takes


42
0:2:51,541 --> 0:2:54,62
to blast through a steel plate door 
from only a few meters away,


43
0:2:54,62 --> 0:2:57,902
without blowing myself, 
or my team, up behind me.


44
0:2:57,902 --> 0:3:2,479
And I knew that Baghdad was a shitty place, 
and when things go bang,


45
0:3:2,479 --> 0:3:4,503
well, people die.


46
0:3:4,503 --> 0:3:7,396
Now back then, I'd no idea 
what a conservationist did,


47
0:3:7,396 --> 0:3:11,661
other than hug trees and piss off large corporations. 
(Laughter)


48
0:3:11,661 --> 0:3:16,638
I knew they had dreadlocks.
I knew they smoked dope. (Laughter)


49
0:3:16,638 --> 0:3:19,312
I didn't really give a shit about the environment, 
and why should I?


50
0:3:19,312 --> 0:3:24,662
I was the idiot that used to speed up in his car 
just trying to hit birds on the road.


51
0:3:24,662 --> 0:3:27,7
My life was a world away 
from conservation.


52
0:3:27,7 --> 0:3:29,5
I'd just spent nine years 
doing things in real life


53
0:3:29,5 --> 0:3:34,9
most people wouldn't dream 
of trying on a Playstation.


54
0:3:34,9 --> 0:3:40,496
Well, after 12 tours to Iraq as a so-called 'mercenary', 
the skills I had were good for one thing:


55
0:3:40,496 --> 0:3:44,721
I was programmed to destroy.


56
0:3:44,721 --> 0:3:49,312
Looking back now, on everything I've done, 
and the places I've been,


57
0:3:49,312 --> 0:3:54,211
in my heart, I've only ever performed 
one true act of bravery.


58
0:3:54,211 --> 0:3:58,13
And that was a simple choice 
of deciding 'Yes' or deciding 'No'.


59
0:3:58,13 --> 0:4:1,137
But it was that one act 
which defines me completely


60
0:4:1,137 --> 0:4:7,278
and ensures there'll never be separation 
between who I am, and what I do.


61
0:4:7,278 --> 0:4:9,459
When I finally left Iraq behind me I was lost.


62
0:4:9,459 --> 0:4:12,858
Yeah I felt – ahh – I just had no idea 
where I was going in life


63
0:4:12,858 --> 0:4:16,86
or where I was meant to be and I arrived in Africa 
at the beginning of 2009.


64
0:4:16,86 --> 0:4:19,536
I was aged 29 at the time.


65
0:4:19,536 --> 0:4:22,297
Somehow, I always knew 
I'd find a purpose amongst chaos,


66
0:4:22,297 --> 0:4:24,257
and that's exactly what happened.


67
0:4:24,257 --> 0:4:29,943
I'd no idea though, I'd find it in a remote part 
of the Zimbabwe bush.


68
0:4:29,943 --> 0:4:32,844
And we were patrolling along, 
and the vultures circled in the air


69
0:4:32,844 --> 0:4:38,463
and as we got closer the stench of death
hung there, in the air like a thick, dark veil,


70
0:4:38,463 --> 0:4:41,407
and sucked the oxygen
out of your lungs.


71
0:4:41,407 --> 0:4:45,14
And as we got closer, 
there was a great bull elephant,


72
0:4:45,14 --> 0:4:49,513
resting on its side, with its face cut away.


73
0:4:49,513 --> 0:4:53,107
And the world around me stopped.


74
0:4:53,107 --> 0:4:56,646
I was consumed by a deep 
and overwhelming sadness.


75
0:4:56,646 --> 0:5:0,319
Seeing innocent creatures killed like this 
hit me in a way like nothing before.


76
0:5:0,319 --> 0:5:4,741
I'd actually poached as a teenager 
and they're memories I'll take to the grave.


77
0:5:4,741 --> 0:5:9,726
Time had changed me though; 
something inside wasn't the same.


78
0:5:9,726 --> 0:5:13,859
And it's never gonna be again.


79
0:5:13,859 --> 0:5:18,303
I asked myself, 
"Does that elephant need its face


80
0:5:18,303 --> 0:5:21,38
more than some guy in Asia needs 
a tusk on his desk?"


81
0:5:21,38 --> 0:5:25,81
Well of course it bloody does, 
that was irrelevant.


82
0:5:25,81 --> 0:5:27,432
All that mattered there and then was:


83
0:5:27,432 --> 0:5:30,175
Would I be brave enough to give up
everything in my life


84
0:5:30,175 --> 0:5:32,918
to try and stop
the suffering of animals?


85
0:5:32,918 --> 0:5:35,662
This was the one true defining 
moment of my life:


86
0:5:35,662 --> 0:5:38,577
Yes or no?


87
0:5:38,577 --> 0:5:42,661
I contacted my family the next day 
and began selling all my houses.


88
0:5:42,661 --> 0:5:46,862
These are assets a well-advised mercenary 
quickly acquires with the proceeds of war.


89
0:5:46,862 --> 0:5:50,381
My life-savings have since been used
to found and grow


90
0:5:50,381 --> 0:5:53,9
the International Anti-Poaching
Foundation.


91
0:5:53,9 --> 0:5:57,513
The IAPF is a direct-action, 
law enforcement organization.


92
0:5:57,513 --> 0:6:1,742
From drone technology, 
to an international qualification for rangers,


93
0:6:1,742 --> 0:6:4,501
we're battling each and every day 
to bring military solutions


94
0:6:4,501 --> 0:6:8,457
to conservation's thin green line.


95
0:6:8,457 --> 0:6:11,552
Now my story may be slightly unique,


96
0:6:11,552 --> 0:6:15,145
but I'm not going to use it to talk to you today 
about the organization I run --


97
0:6:15,145 --> 0:6:18,856
in what probably could have been 
a pretty good fundraiser.


98
0:6:18,856 --> 0:6:26,541
(Laughter) (Applause)


99
0:6:26,541 --> 0:6:32,523
Remember, today is about the question 
I'm gonna ask you at the end.


100
0:6:32,523 --> 0:6:36,145
Because it's impossible for me to get up here
and talk about just saving wildlife


101
0:6:36,145 --> 0:6:43,119
when I know the problem of animal welfare 
is much broader throughout society.


102
0:6:43,119 --> 0:6:47,303
A few years after I saw that elephant 
I woke up very early one morning.


103
0:6:47,303 --> 0:6:50,964
I already knew the answer to the question 
I was about to ask myself,


104
0:6:50,964 --> 0:6:55,944
but it was the first time
I'd put it into words:


105
0:6:55,944 --> 0:7:4,757
Does a cow value its life 
more than I enjoy a barbecue?


106
0:7:4,757 --> 0:7:8,889
See, I'd been guilty all this time 
of what's termed 'speciesism'.


107
0:7:8,889 --> 0:7:12,541
Speciesism is very much the same 
as racism or sexism.


108
0:7:12,541 --> 0:7:15,5
It involves the allocation
of a different set of values,


109
0:7:15,5 --> 0:7:18,459
rights or special considerations
to individuals,


110
0:7:18,459 --> 0:7:21,821
based solely on who or what they are.


111
0:7:21,821 --> 0:7:23,843
The realisation
of the flexible morality


112
0:7:23,843 --> 0:7:27,875
I'd used to suit my everyday conveniences 
made me sick in the stomach.


113
0:7:27,875 --> 0:7:32,78
See, I'd loved blaming parts of Asia 
for their insatiable demand for ivory and rhino horn,


114
0:7:32,78 --> 0:7:35,29
and the way the region's
booming economic growth


115
0:7:35,29 --> 0:7:39,26
is dramatically increasing
the illegal wildlife trade.


116
0:7:39,26 --> 0:7:41,341
When I woke up that morning
though I realised,


117
0:7:41,341 --> 0:7:45,153
even though I'd dedicated my life 
to saving animals,


118
0:7:45,153 --> 0:7:47,501
in my mind I was no better
than a poacher,


119
0:7:47,501 --> 0:7:51,739
or the guy in Asia
with a tusk on his desk.


120
0:7:51,739 --> 0:7:59,21
As this 'over-consumptive meat-eater' 
I'd referred to some animals as 'beasts'.


121
0:7:59,21 --> 0:8:4,337
When in reality I'd been the beast: 
destructively obedient,


122
0:8:4,337 --> 0:8:10,342
a slave to my habits, 
a cold shoulder to my conscience.


123
0:8:10,342 --> 0:8:13,502
We've all had contact with pets 
or other animals in our lives.


124
0:8:13,502 --> 0:8:17,152
We can't deny our understanding 
of the feelings that each animal has.


125
0:8:17,152 --> 0:8:19,976
The ability to suffer pain
or loneliness.


126
0:8:19,976 --> 0:8:22,221
And to fear.


127
0:8:22,221 --> 0:8:26,387
Like us also, each animal has the ability 
to express contentment,


128
0:8:26,387 --> 0:8:31,778
to build family structures, and want 
of satisfying basic instincts and desires.


129
0:8:31,778 --> 0:8:34,19
For many of us though,


130
0:8:34,19 --> 0:8:36,512
that's as far as we allow
our imagination to explore


131
0:8:36,512 --> 0:8:41,48
before the truth inconveniences
our habits.


132
0:8:41,48 --> 0:8:43,421
The disconnect that exists 
between consuming a product


133
0:8:43,421 --> 0:8:47,145
and the reality it takes to bring that product 
to market is a phenomenon to itself.


134
0:8:47,145 --> 0:8:50,777
Animals are treated like commodities 
and referred to as property.


135
0:8:50,777 --> 0:8:55,504
We call it 'murder' to kill a human being 
yet create legal and illegal industries


136
0:8:55,504 --> 0:8:58,24
out of what would be regarded as torture 
if humans were involved.


137
0:8:58,24 --> 0:9:4,229
And we pay people to do things to animals 
that none of us would engage in personally.


138
0:9:4,229 --> 0:9:9,659
Just because we don't see it up close 
does not mean we're not responsible.


139
0:9:9,659 --> 0:9:13,713
Peter Singer, the man who popularised 
the term 'speciesism' wrote,


140
0:9:13,713 --> 0:9:17,782
"Although there may be differences 
between animals and humans


141
0:9:17,782 --> 0:9:20,62
they each share the ability to suffer.


142
0:9:20,62 --> 0:9:25,101
And we must give equal consideration 
to that suffering.


143
0:9:25,101 --> 0:9:29,1
Any position that allows similar cases 
to be treated in a dissimilar fashion


144
0:9:29,1 --> 0:9:34,101
fails to qualify as an acceptable
moral theory."


145
0:9:34,101 --> 0:9:40,2
Around the world this year 65 billion
animals will be killed in factory farms.


146
0:9:40,2 --> 0:9:44,261
How many animals' lives
is one human's life worth?


147
0:9:44,261 --> 0:9:50,74
A meat-eater in this room will consume, 
on average, 8,000 animals in their lifetime.


148
0:9:50,74 --> 0:9:53,82
Ocean pollution, global warming 
and deforestation


149
0:9:53,82 --> 0:9:56,787
are driving us towards 
the next great mass-extinction


150
0:9:56,787 --> 0:10:2,191
and the meat industry is the greatest negative factor 
in all of these phenomena.


151
0:10:2,191 --> 0:10:6,61
The illegal traffic in wildlife now ranks 
as one of the largest criminal industries in the world --


152
0:10:6,61 --> 0:10:9,914
it's up there with drugs, guns 
and human trafficking.


153
0:10:9,914 --> 0:10:11,74
The ability to stop this devastation


154
0:10:11,74 --> 0:10:13,78
lies in the willingness
of an international community


155
0:10:13,78 --> 0:10:18,814
to step in and preserve
a dying global treasure.


156
0:10:18,814 --> 0:10:21,242
Experimentation on animals –


157
0:10:21,242 --> 0:10:24,835
If animals are so like us that we can substitute 
using them instead of humans


158
0:10:24,835 --> 0:10:27,605
then surely they have 
the very same attributes


159
0:10:27,605 --> 0:10:32,504
that mean they deserve 
to be protected from harm?


160
0:10:32,504 --> 0:10:37,71
Whether we're talking about factory farming, 
live export, poaching, the fur trade,


161
0:10:37,71 --> 0:10:41,227
logically, it's all on the same
playing field to me.


162
0:10:41,227 --> 0:10:43,171
Suffering is suffering,


163
0:10:43,171 --> 0:10:45,6
and murder is murder.


164
0:10:45,6 --> 0:10:47,21
And the more helpless the victim,


165
0:10:47,21 --> 0:10:50,781
the more horrific the crime.


166
0:10:50,781 --> 0:10:54,926
Next time you think 
an animal lover is too emotional,


167
0:10:54,926 --> 0:10:57,301
too passionate, or even a little crazy, 
please remember


168
0:10:57,301 --> 0:11:2,622
we see things through a different lens.


169
0:11:2,622 --> 0:11:6,82
So in a few days,
my son's gonna be born.


170
0:11:6,82 --> 0:11:10,524
I find myself wondering, 
"What kind of world is he entering?"


171
0:11:10,524 --> 0:11:15,18
Are we gonna be the generation 
that defines our failure as a species?


172
0:11:15,18 --> 0:11:17,695
I believe our generation
will be judged


173
0:11:17,695 --> 0:11:21,363
by our moral courage
to protect what's right.


174
0:11:21,363 --> 0:11:26,147
And that every worthwhile action 
requires a level of sacrifice.


175
0:11:26,147 --> 0:11:30,74
Well, I now offer myself, 
without reservation, to animals.


176
0:11:30,74 --> 0:11:35,232
And when I strip away 
all the material belongings around me,


177
0:11:35,232 --> 0:11:38,315
I see that I too, am an animal.


178
0:11:38,315 --> 0:11:43,18
We're family. 
Together on one planet.


179
0:11:43,18 --> 0:11:45,62
And of the five million species
on that planet,


180
0:11:45,62 --> 0:11:49,46
only one has the power to determine 
what level of suffering is acceptable


181
0:11:49,46 --> 0:11:53,586
for all other sentient beings
to endure.


182
0:11:53,586 --> 0:11:55,6
Whether it's eating less meat,


183
0:11:55,6 --> 0:11:59,194
contributing to the fight against poaching
or speaking up for the voiceless,


184
0:11:59,194 --> 0:12:0,984
we all have choices.


185
0:12:0,984 --> 0:12:6,341
And small changes in our lives
mean big changes in others' [lives].


186
0:12:6,341 --> 0:12:8,413
So now back to the beginning.


187
0:12:8,413 --> 0:12:12,178
My reason for being here
is my question for you:


188
0:12:12,178 --> 0:12:16,904
next time you have an opportunity 
to make a difference for animals,


189
0:12:16,904 --> 0:12:18,502
will you be brave enough?


190
0:12:18,502 --> 0:12:20,141
Yes or no?


191
0:12:20,141 --> 0:12:21,524
Thank you very much.


192
0:12:21,524 --> 0:14:21,524
(Applause)
