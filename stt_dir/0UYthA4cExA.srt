1
0:0:0,61 --> 0:0:4,319
OKAY. GOOD MORNING ALL. CONGRATULATIONS TO
YOU


2
0:0:4,319 --> 0:0:6,72
ALL WHO TRAVELED THROUGH THE INCLEMENT WEATHER
THIS


3
0:0:6,72 --> 0:0:12,349
MORNING. I AM PROUD OF YOU. THANKS FOR COMING.
JUST


4
0:0:12,349 --> 0:0:15,209
A REMINDER, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WERE NOT
HERE ON


5
0:0:15,209 --> 0:0:18,87
WEDNESDAY, NEXT WEEK, NEXT FRIDAY WE START
THE BOOK


6
0:0:18,87 --> 0:0:23,14
CLUB. SO 20 PEOPLE SIGNED UP SO FAR. IF ANYONE
ELSE


7
0:0:23,14 --> 0:0:26,36
WANTS TO SIGN UP PLEASE COME UP AFTERWARDS
AND PUT


8
0:0:26,36 --> 0:0:33,5
YOUR NAME AND EMAIL HERE. I WILL BE HOLDING
OFFICE


9
0:0:33,5 --> 0:0:39,16
HOURS TODAY, OFFICE HOURS IN 20 WHATEVER.
SAME


10
0:0:39,16 --> 0:0:46,19
ROOM THAT LOU WAS USING PREVIOUSLY, 13 MAYBE.
SO COME


11
0:0:46,19 --> 0:0:50,42
ALONG IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS I AM HAPPY TO
TALK TO YOU


12
0:0:50,42 --> 0:0:54,489
ALL. OKAY. SO IN THE LAST, THE OTHER THING
I WANT TO


13
0:0:54,489 --> 0:0:57,1
REMIND YOU OF IS THE UNDERSTANDING EVOLUTION
WEB SITE.


14
0:0:57,1 --> 0:1:0,36
I TOLD YOU ABOUT THIS ON WEDNESDAY. IT IS
A REALLY


15
0:1:0,36 --> 0:1:6,54
GOOD RESOURCE. AND A LOT OF USEFUL INFORMATION
THERE


16
0:1:6,54 --> 0:1:8,57
PARTICULARLY, TO DO WITH PHYLOGENETIC'S AND
THE TREE


17
0:1:8,57 --> 0:1:14,89
 OF LIFE WHICH IS OUR SUBJECT TODAY. SO,
IN THE LAST


18
0:1:14,89 --> 0:1:19,36
LECTURE WE WENT THROUGH THE FOUNDATIONS OF
THE


19
0:1:19,36 --> 0:1:22,65
SO-CALLED THEORY OF EVOLUTION. FOUNDATIONS
OF


20
0:1:22,65 --> 0:1:25,49
EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY. WE SORT OF ENDED UP
WITH TWO


21
0:1:25,49 --> 0:1:26,21
BIG IDEAS.


22
0:1:26,21 --> 0:1:35,39
THE FIRST WAS THE PRINCIPLE OF DESCENT WITH


23
0:1:35,39 --> 0:1:47,5
MODIFICATION.


24
0:1:47,5 --> 0:1:54,85
AND THE SECOND WAS THE PRINCIPLE OF


25
0:1:54,85 --> 0:1:59,299
NATURAL SELECTION.


26
0:1:59,299 --> 0:2:1,9
SO WHAT I WANT TO DO TODAY IS JUST TAKE YOU


27
0:2:1,9 --> 0:2:4,17
THROUGH EACH OF THOSE. INTRODUCE YOU TO EACH
OF THESE


28
0:2:4,17 --> 0:2:10,729
IDEAS AND THEN WE WILL GO ON TO LOOK AT THE
TREE OF


29
0:2:10,729 --> 0:2:13,7
LIFE. HOW WE UNDERSTAND RELATIONSHIPS AMONGST


30
0:2:13,7 --> 0:2:18,17
ORGANISMS GIVEN THEY HAVE DESCENDED THROUGH
EVOLUTION


31
0:2:18,17 --> 0:2:23,43
THROUGH NATURAL SELECTION FROM A COMMON ANCESTOR.


32
0:2:23,43 --> 0:2:25,78
TODAY IS ABOUT THE TREE OF LIFE AND IT CONNECTS
WITH


33
0:2:25,78 --> 0:2:28,97
A LAB THAT YOU HAVE MAYBE NEXT WEEK OR THE
WEEK AFTER.


34
0:2:28,97 --> 0:2:32,629
I AM NOT SURE WHICH.


35
0:2:32,629 --> 0:2:42,93
SO, LET'S LOOK FIRST OF ALL THIS IDEA OF DESCENT
 WITH MODIFICATION. SO THE ORIGIN OF THE


36
0:2:42,93 --> 0:2:43,37
SPECIES IN


37
0:2:43,37 --> 0:2:46,78
DARWIN'S BIG BOOK. THERE IS ONLY ONE FIGURE
IN THE


38
0:2:46,78 --> 0:2:49,76
WHOLE BOOK. THE REST OF IT IS A BUNCH OF WONDERFUL


39
0:2:49,76 --> 0:2:54,58
WORDS. BUT THE FIGURE, THAT FIGURE WAS REPRODUCED
IN


40
0:2:54,58 --> 0:2:57,91
THE LECTURE NOTES FROM WEDNESDAY, THE LAST
LECTURE.


41
0:2:57,91 --> 0:3:2,61
BUT IT IS SORT OF CARTOON VERSION OF IT WOULD
LOOK


42
0:3:2,61 --> 0:3:13,61
SOMETHING LIKE THIS. AND SO ON.


43
0:3:13,61 --> 0:3:26,5
THIS IS TIME COMING TO THE PRESENT. THIS IS
THE


44
0:3:26,5 --> 0:3:40,92
PAST. ACROSS HERE WE HAVE SOME PHENOTYPE.
IT IS THAT


45
0:3:40,92 --> 0:3:43,18
THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ORGANISMS COULD BE
LIFE


46
0:3:43,18 --> 0:3:48,8
HISTORY, COULD BE GROWTH FORMS, COULD BE A
WHOLE


47
0:3:48,8 --> 0:3:50,4
VARIETY OF THINGS WE WILL SEE LATER.


48
0:3:50,4 --> 0:3:56,49
SO, SOME OF THESE THINGS DON'T GO ALL OF THE
WAY


49
0:3:56,49 --> 0:4:2,519
TO THE TIPS. THESE ARE EXTINCT FORMS. DEAD.
OFF THE


50
0:4:2,519 --> 0:4:13,87
PLANET. AND WE HAVE A COMMON ANCESTOR.


51
0:4:13,87 --> 0:4:15,9
SO THESE TIPS


52
0:4:15,9 --> 0:4:19,989
OF THE TREE ARE LIVING FORMS. THAT IS WHAT
WE CAN SEE


53
0:4:19,989 --> 0:4:23,86
ON THE PLANET NOW AND THEY ARE DERIVED FROM
A COMMON


54
0:4:23,86 --> 0:4:27,81
ANCESTOR OVER TIME AND BECOMING EXTINCT OVER
TIME IN


55
0:4:27,81 --> 0:4:34,74
 PHENOTYPE IN APPEARANCE IN THEIR TRAITS
AS A RESULT OF


56
0:4:34,74 --> 0:4:37,509
THIS PATTERN OF DESCENT COMBINED WITH EXTINCTION.


57
0:4:37,509 --> 0:4:52,3
YEAH IT IS EARLY, ISN'T IT. SO COMMON ANCESTOR,


58
0:4:52,3 --> 0:4:54,74
DIVERSIFIED OVER TIME AND THEN DISCONTINUITIES


59
0:4:54,74 --> 0:5:0,259
ARISING. GAPS IN THAT DISTRIBUTION OF PHENOTYPES


60
0:5:0,259 --> 0:5:4,71
BECAUSE OF EXTINCTION.


61
0:5:4,71 --> 0:5:14,399
SO WE HAVE DISCONTINUITIES


62
0:5:14,399 --> 0:5:14,61
ARISING THROUGH


63
0:5:14,61 --> 0:5:20,46
COMBINATION OF DIVERGENCES IN FORM OVER TIME.


64
0:5:20,46 --> 0:5:22,789
COMBINED WITH EXTINCTION, WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY
PUNCHES


65
0:5:22,789 --> 0:5:26,96
HOLES IN THE DISTRIBUTION. LINEAGES BECOME
EXTINCT


66
0:5:26,96 --> 0:5:31,699
CREATING GAPS IN THESE PHENOTYPES. SO HOW
DOES THIS


67
0:5:31,699 --> 0:5:35,119
ALL RELATE TO WHAT WE SEE TODAY? WELL, WE
SEE


68
0:5:35,119 --> 0:5:38,919
VARIETIES OR SUB-SPECIES AMONG THE MOST CLOSELY


69
0:5:38,919 --> 0:5:43,639
RELATED THINGS. THEY ARE CLUSTERED INTO SPECIES.
NOW


70
0:5:43,639 --> 0:5:46,419
WE ARE COMING BACK TO THE LINNAEAN HIERARCHY
OF


71
0:5:46,419 --> 0:5:51,33
TAXONOMY, VARIETIES OF SUB-SPECIES, SPECIES,
GENERA.


72
0:5:51,33 --> 0:5:54,779
MAYBE THIS WHOLE THING IS A GENUS. SO, THAT
IS A


73
0:5:54,779 --> 0:6:2,419
SPECIES. MAYBE ALL THIS IS A GENUS. SO, THIS
FIGURE


74
0:6:2,419 --> 0:6:4,729
 OUT OF DARWIN'S BOOK REALLY ENCAPSULATES
ALL THESE


75
0:6:4,729 --> 0:6:9,509
IDEAS OF A COMMON ANCESTOR, DESCENT, EXTINCTION.


76
0:6:9,509 --> 0:6:14,649
GIVING RISE TO THE BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY WE
SEE TODAY.


77
0:6:14,649 --> 0:6:19,99
VERY SIMPLE IDEA. AND, IN FACT, DARWIN DIDN'T
REALLY


78
0:6:19,99 --> 0:6:24,229
SEE HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VARIETIES OR SUB-SPECIES


79
0:6:24,229 --> 0:6:27,58
AND SPECIES. THE BOOK ULTIMATELY WAS ABOUT


80
0:6:27,58 --> 0:6:30,279
SPECIATION, ABOUT THE FORMATION OF NEW SPECIES
THROUGH


81
0:6:30,279 --> 0:6:34,949
EVOLUTION. HE SAW SPECIES AS ONE PART OF THIS


82
0:6:34,949 --> 0:6:41,199
CONTINUUM OF EVOLUTION THROUGH TIME. AND THAT
THEY


83
0:6:41,199 --> 0:6:43,55
ARE MAPPED BY THESE DISCONTINUITIES. AND THAT
THIS


84
0:6:43,55 --> 0:6:47,849
WHAT ENDS UP AS ONE CLUSTER. IF YOU LACK PHENOTYPES
OR


85
0:6:47,849 --> 0:6:49,909
THE INDIVIDUALS ARE MORE SIMILAR TO EACH OTHER
THAN


86
0:6:49,909 --> 0:6:53,899
THEY ARE TO ANYTHING ELSE. HERE IS ANOTHER
CLUSTER


87
0:6:53,899 --> 0:6:58,39
HERE PERHAPS. ANOTHER CLUSTER HERE. SO NOW
YOU HAVE


88
0:6:58,39 --> 0:7:2,529
3 SPECIES HERE. BUT THE REASON WE CAN DISCERN
THEM,


89
0:7:2,529 --> 0:7:5,58
DETECT THEM IS BECAUSE OF THESE DISCONTINUITIES
CAUSED


90
0:7:5,58 --> 0:7:11,2
BY EXTINCTION. PUTTING HOLES IN THIS DISTRIBUTION
OF


91
0:7:11,2 --> 0:7:17,599
PHENOTYPE. MAKE SENSE? NO? ANY QUESTIONS?
8


92
0:7:17,599 --> 0:7:20,939
 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING IS BRUTAL.


93
0:7:20,939 --> 0:7:29,99
IT


94
0:7:29,99 --> 0:7:30,279
DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU GET THESE


95
0:7:30,279 --> 0:7:34,55
DISCONTINUITIES THROUGH THIS DIVERSIFICATION
PROCESS.


96
0:7:34,55 --> 0:7:39,719
YOU MIGHT CALL THIS A SPECIES, THIS A SPECIES
AND THIS


97
0:7:39,719 --> 0:7:42,849
A SPECIES. THEY ARE ALL SIMILAR BECAUSE THEY
HAVE


98
0:7:42,849 --> 0:7:44,979
A COMMON ANCESTOR SO THEY ARE GROUPED INTO
A GENUS.


99
0:7:44,979 --> 0:7:52,89
OKAY? AND SO GENERA ARE GROUPED IN FAMILIES.


100
0:7:52,89 --> 0:7:59,509
FAMILIES ARE GROUPED INTO ORDERS.


101
0:7:59,509 --> 0:8:1,8
SO, SOMETIMES YOU HAVE A SINGLE SPECIES IN


102
0:8:1,8 --> 0:8:8,379
A GENUS. HOMOSAPIENS IS THE ONLY EXTANT HOMO.
IT IS


103
0:8:8,379 --> 0:8:13,849
WITHIN THE HOMINIDS WHICH IS A BIG GROUPING.
DOES


104
0:8:13,849 --> 0:8:17,159
THAT MAKE SENSE?


105
0:8:17,159 --> 0:8:19,99
SO, IN THIS PARTICULAR EXAMPLE WE HAVE GOT
3


106
0:8:19,99 --> 0:8:22,979
SPECIES IN A GENUS. IN OTHER CASE YOU MAY
HAVE


107
0:8:22,979 --> 0:8:25,129
SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY DISTINCTIVE OUT HERE.
SO, IT


108
0:8:25,129 --> 0:8:29,2
IS THAT MORE DISTINCTION THAT DISTINCT MIGHT
BE A


109
0:8:29,2 --> 0:8:30,499
SINGLE SPECIES IN A SINGLE GENUS.


110
0:8:30,499 --> 0:8:39,959
CAUSED BY BOTH. THE BRANCHING PROCESS OVER
TIME


111
0:8:39,959 --> 0:8:48,129
 AND EXTINCTION OF INTERMEDIATE FORMS. THINK
ABOUT


112
0:8:48,129 --> 0:8:52,55
BOTH THINGS HAPPENING SIMULTANEOUSLY. OKAY.
ALL


113
0:8:52,55 --> 0:8:56,48
RIGHT. WE CAN COME BACK TO THIS AS NEED BE.
LET'S


114
0:8:56,48 --> 0:8:58,98
LOOK AT THE SECOND IDEA, WHICH IS THE PRINCIPLE
OF


115
0:8:58,98 --> 0:9:0,959
NATURAL SELECTION.


116
0:9:0,959 --> 0:9:12,519
WE WILL COME BACK TO THIS IN MORE DETAIL LATER.


117
0:9:12,519 --> 0:9:17,19
BUT ARISES FROM SEVERAL OBSERVATIONS AND A
SORT OF


118
0:9:17,19 --> 0:9:20,24
CHAIN OF LOGIC THAT DARWIN AND WALLACE PUT
FORWARD.


119
0:9:20,24 --> 0:9:36,69
THAT IS, INDIVIDUALS VARY FOR TRAITS. THAT
IS;


120
0:9:36,69 --> 0:9:39,199
CHARACTERISTICS, ALL VARY IN HEIGHT, EYE COLOR,
HAIR


121
0:9:39,199 --> 0:9:42,37
COLOR, A WHOLE BUNCH OF PROPERTIES. EACH ONE
OF THOSE


122
0:9:42,37 --> 0:9:48,519
IS A TRAIT.


123
0:9:48,519 --> 0:9:53,399
IF THOSE TRAITS ARE AT LEAST PARTLY


124
0:9:53,399 --> 0:9:59,44
HERITABLE,


125
0:9:59,44 --> 0:10:1,1
THAT IS, PASSED FROM PARENT TO OFFSPRING,


126
0:10:1,1 --> 0:10:7,829
IF INDIVIDUALS CARRYING THOSE DIFFERENT TYPES
OF


127
0:10:7,829 --> 0:10:22,29
TRAITS VARY IN SURVIVAL OR REPRODUCTION,


128
0:10:22,29 --> 0:10:24,709
THAT IS,


129
0:10:24,709 --> 0:10:31,269
SO-CALLED FITNESS, SO IF THOSE THREE CONDITIONS
ARE


130
0:10:31,269 --> 0:10:36,529
MET, THEN THE TRAITS THAT INCREASE SURVIVAL
AND


131
0:10:36,529 --> 0:10:39,74
REPRODUCTION WILL BECOME MORE COMMON IN THE
NEXT


132
0:10:39,74 --> 0:10:44,31
 GENERATION. IT IS A MATHEMATICAL INEVITABILITY.
IF


133
0:10:44,31 --> 0:10:48,509
SOME VARIETIES, LET'S SAY GET BLUE EYES, INCREASE
THE


134
0:10:48,509 --> 0:10:51,55
SURVIVAL AND REPRODUCTION FOR SOME REASON.
WE KNOW IT


135
0:10:51,55 --> 0:10:56,31
IS HERITABLE. IF THE INDIVIDUALS WITH BLUE
EYES IN


136
0:10:56,31 --> 0:10:58,87
THIS AUDIENCE LEAVE MORE OFFSPRING TO THE
NEXT


137
0:10:58,87 --> 0:11:2,189
GENERATION, BLUE EYES ITSELF WILL BE MORE
COMMON IN


138
0:11:2,189 --> 0:11:9,149
THAT POPULATION. OKAY?


139
0:11:9,149 --> 0:11:14,839
SO, YOU INCREASE THE PROPORTION OF FAVORABLE


140
0:11:14,839 --> 0:11:23,699
TRAITS IN THE NEXT GENERATION. SO, VERY IMPORTANT


141
0:11:23,699 --> 0:11:31,1
THING HERE. INDIVIDUALS THAT REPRODUCE OR
DIE. IT IS


142
0:11:31,1 --> 0:11:34,41
POPULATIONS OR SPECIES THAT EVOLVE. INDIVIDUALS
DO


143
0:11:34,41 --> 0:11:40,89
NOT EVOLVE. OKAY? ONLY POPULATION, ONLY GROUPS
OF


144
0:11:40,89 --> 0:11:43,22
INDIVIDUALS HAVE THIS CHARACTERISTIC POPULATIONS
AND


145
0:11:43,22 --> 0:11:43,699
SPECIES.


146
0:11:43,699 --> 0:11:58,68
BUT THEY DO SO BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENCES
IN


147
0:11:58,68 --> 0:12:1,17
REPRODUCTION AND SURVIVAL AMONGST INDIVIDUALS


148
0:12:1,17 --> 0:12:11,899
ACCORDING TO THE TRAITS THAT THEY CARRY.


149
0:12:11,899 --> 0:12:21,519
OKAY. AND WE ARE GOING TO COME BACK TO THIS
 PRINCIPLE, FOUNDATION OF EVOLUTIONARY THEORY


150
0:12:21,519 --> 0:12:22,149
IN MORE


151
0:12:22,149 --> 0:12:29,829
SOPHISTICATED MATHEMATICAL TERMS LATER ON.


152
0:12:29,829 --> 0:12:31,68
SO, BRIEFLY MENTIONED, I WILL COME BACK AND


153
0:12:31,68 --> 0:12:35,24
REVISIT THE IDEA OF THE WAY THEY KNITTED TOGETHER
THE


154
0:12:35,24 --> 0:12:42,4
EVIDENCE FOR THIS IDEA. TWO IDEAS, DISSENT
WITH


155
0:12:42,4 --> 0:12:48,449
MODIFICATION, NATURAL SELECTION. THEY ARE
THE TWO


156
0:12:48,449 --> 0:12:53,3
OBSERVATIONS. SO AGAIN, SOME OF THE EVIDENCE
THAT, I


157
0:12:53,3 --> 0:13:3,16
CAN'T SPELL TODAY, THAT THEY BROUGHT TO BEAR
ON THIS


158
0:13:3,16 --> 0:13:12,72
WAS ARTIFICIAL SELECTION. THAT IS, BREEDERS
OF


159
0:13:12,72 --> 0:13:17,66
PIGEONS AND DOGS AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. AND
THAT


160
0:13:17,66 --> 0:13:20,839
SHOWED IF YOU PREFER A PARTICULAR VARIANT
IN THE


161
0:13:20,839 --> 0:13:24,379
POPULATION AND ONLY BRED WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS,
FOR


162
0:13:24,379 --> 0:13:29,29
EXAMPLE, THAT YOU SAW THE INCREASE IN THE
PREFERRED


163
0:13:29,29 --> 0:13:30,87
TRAIT.


164
0:13:30,87 --> 0:13:36,949
THE OTHER LINES OF EVIDENCE THAT I MENTIONED
IN


165
0:13:36,949 --> 0:13:39,35
THE LAST LECTURE WERE THE FACT THAT THERE
WAS


166
0:13:39,35 --> 0:13:47,699
POPULATION PRESSURE. THERE IS COMPETITION.
MORE


167
0:13:47,699 --> 0:13:51,519
OFFSPRING ARE PRODUCED THAT CAN SURVIVE. MORE
ZYGOTES


168
0:13:51,519 --> 0:13:56,59
 ARE PRODUCED AND CAN SURVIVE GIVING RISE
IN


169
0:13:56,59 --> 0:13:57,66
DIFFERENCES IN REPRODUCTION AND SURVIVAL.


170
0:13:57,66 --> 0:14:7,399
THE FOSSIL RECORD


171
0:14:7,399 --> 0:14:14,73
WHICH SHOWS BY EXTINCTION


172
0:14:14,73 --> 0:14:15,319
AND


173
0:14:15,319 --> 0:14:19,499
PROVIDES DIRECT EVIDENCE AS WE WILL SEE LATER
TO


174
0:14:19,499 --> 0:14:26,18
TRANSITIONAL FORMS.


175
0:14:26,18 --> 0:14:27,899
BY RECONSTRUCTING CHARACTERISTICS


176
0:14:27,899 --> 0:14:30,86
BACK FROM THE TREE OF LIFE, YOU CAN PREDICT
THAT THERE


177
0:14:30,86 --> 0:14:33,79
SHOULD BE SOMETHING IN THE PAST THAT HAS A
PARTICULAR


178
0:14:33,79 --> 0:14:38,139
COMBINATION OF CHARACTERISTICS. AND, IF YOU
ARE


179
0:14:38,139 --> 0:14:40,819
FORTUNATE YOU CAN TEST THAT PREDICTION IF
YOU HAVE


180
0:14:40,819 --> 0:14:42,35
A REALLY GOOD FOSSIL RECORD BY LOOKING FOR
THAT GROUP


181
0:14:42,35 --> 0:14:44,35
OF ORGANISMS. YOU CAN TEST IT BY LOOKING FOR
THAT


182
0:14:44,35 --> 0:14:47,66
COMBINATION OF FORMS. AND WE WILL SEE AN EXAMPLE
OF


183
0:14:47,66 --> 0:14:52,829
THAT LATER ON. WE TALKED ABOUT BIOGEOGRAPHY,
ISLAND


184
0:14:52,829 --> 0:15:0,749
RADIATIONS, AND SO FORTH. AGAIN, DARWIN AND
WALLACE


185
0:15:0,749 --> 0:15:6,939
SAW THESE OR CONTRIBUTED TO THIS IDEA. THE
OTHER ONE I


186
0:15:6,939 --> 0:15:9,54
WANT TO SPENT A MINUTE ON HERE BECAUSE IT
RELATES TO


187
0:15:9,54 --> 0:15:13,6
HOW WE ESTIMATE RELATIONSHIPS, COMES FROM
THE


188
0:15:13,6 --> 0:15:24,589
EMBRYOLOGY AND COMPARATIVE ANATOMY. WHICH
IS, THE


189
0:15:24,589 --> 0:15:36,129
 IDEA OF HOMOLOGOUS STRUCTURES. THAT THERE
ARE


190
0:15:36,129 --> 0:15:40,4
PARTICULAR STRUCTURES THAT DIFFER AMONG RELATED
GROUPS


191
0:15:40,4 --> 0:15:43,59
OF ORGANISMS BUT THEY ALL COME FROM A SINGLE
ANCESTOR


192
0:15:43,59 --> 0:15:50,769
CONDITION THROUGH DESCENT OF MODIFICATION.


193
0:15:50,769 --> 0:15:54,809
SO, LET'S LOOK AT THIS IDEA A BIT. PRINCIPLE
OF


194
0:15:54,809 --> 0:15:55,319
HOMOLOGY.


195
0:15:55,319 --> 0:16:3,68
SO, AT THIS POINT I WANT YOU TO TURN TO THE


196
0:16:3,68 --> 0:16:6,24
FOURTH SLIDE. I HOPE YOU CAN ALL ACCESS THESE
NOW ON


197
0:16:6,24 --> 0:16:10,5
THE WEB. PRINT THEM OUT, BRING THEM ALONG.
DID YOU


198
0:16:10,5 --> 0:16:15,47
REMEMBER TO DO THAT? I TOLD YOU SO.


199
0:16:15,47 --> 0:16:22,709
PRINT THEM OUT. MY DRAWING IS TRULY AWFUL.
ANY


200
0:16:22,709 --> 0:16:24,99
QUESTIONS?


201
0:16:24,99 --> 0:16:27,269
OKAY.


202
0:16:27,269 --> 0:16:30,36
SO, LET'S LOOK AT AN EXAMPLE ON SLIDE 4. I
WILL


203
0:16:30,36 --> 0:16:33,529
NOT DRAW IT. BUT CONSIDER TETRAPOD VERTEBRATES,
THAT


204
0:16:33,529 --> 0:16:41,9
IS THE BIRDS, MAMMALS, REPTILES, AMPHIBIANS.
THAT FALL


205
0:16:41,9 --> 0:16:45,829
IN VERTEBRATES. SO, IN HUMANS OR MAMMALS YOU
HAVE A


206
0:16:45,829 --> 0:16:52,6
FOREARM. THIS THING. IN CATS YOU HAVE FULL
A LIMB.


207
0:16:52,6 --> 0:16:59,18
 I WON'T IMITATE A CAT, KIND OF PATHETIC.
IN WHALES


208
0:16:59,18 --> 0:17:3,379
YOU HAVE A FLIPPER AT THE FRONT. IN BATS YOU
HAVE GOT


209
0:17:3,379 --> 0:17:8,709
A WING. IF YOU LOOK IN DETAIL AT THE ANATOMY
AND THE


210
0:17:8,709 --> 0:17:12,1
DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THOSE TETRAPODS YOU SEE
THEY ARE


211
0:17:12,1 --> 0:17:16,38
ALL DERIVED FROM A COMMON STRUCTURE. THE TETRAPOD


212
0:17:16,38 --> 0:17:22,72
FOUR LIMB. IT ONLY MAKES SENSE IN A LOT OF
EVOLUTION.


213
0:17:22,72 --> 0:17:25,13
FUNCTIONALLY DIFFERENT STRUCTURES FLYING,
SWIMMING,


214
0:17:25,13 --> 0:17:30,23
WALKING, WAVING. ALL COME FROM A COMMON ANCESTRAL


215
0:17:30,23 --> 0:17:35,149
CONDITION, WHICH IS THE ANCESTRAL FOUR LIMB.
AGAIN YOU


216
0:17:35,149 --> 0:17:37,99
CAN SEE THAT IN DEVELOPMENT AND MOLECULAR
DETAILS OF


217
0:17:37,99 --> 0:17:44,95
DEVELOPMENT AND THE COMPARATIVE ANATOMY. TURNING
TO


218
0:17:44,95 --> 0:17:50,659
EMBRYOS, IF YOU COMPARE THE END EMBRYONIC
STAGES OF AN


219
0:17:50,659 --> 0:17:56,57
AMPHIBIAN, A REPTILE, A BIRD OR A MAMMAL,
THEY ALL


220
0:17:56,57 --> 0:18:1,25
START OUT AS AN EARLY ZYGOTE. SIMILAR PATTERNS
OF


221
0:18:1,25 --> 0:18:4,21
DIVISION AND THEN BECOME SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT.
AND THEN


222
0:18:4,21 --> 0:18:7,929
DURING SOME STAGE OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT YOU
CAN SEE


223
0:18:7,929 --> 0:18:11,85
A SORT OF COMMON STRUCTURE. THEY CONVERGE
AGAIN ON


224
0:18:11,85 --> 0:18:19,269
A COMMON APPEARANCE WHICH IS SOMETIMES CALLED
THE


225
0:18:19,269 --> 0:18:26,0
 PHYLOTYPIC STAGE. YOU ARE GOING FROM THE
EGG


226
0:18:26,0 --> 0:18:33,12
FERTILIZED TO GIVE YOU ZYGOTE.


227
0:18:33,12 --> 0:18:34,0
THIS DEVELOPS AND THEN


228
0:18:34,0 --> 0:18:40,84
THIS PARTICULAR STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT, THE
SAME IS TRUE


229
0:18:40,84 --> 0:18:44,7
OF INSECTS, YOU LOOK WITHIN GROUPS OF INSECTS
AND


230
0:18:44,7 --> 0:18:47,2
ACROSS VERTEBRATES. THIS PARTICULAR STAGE
OF


231
0:18:47,2 --> 0:18:54,98
DEVELOPMENT, SO CALLED PHYLOTYPIC STAGE, THEY
ALL LOOK


232
0:18:54,98 --> 0:19:0,83
REALLY, REALLY SIMILAR. THEN I DIVERGE TO
GIVE RISE


233
0:19:0,83 --> 0:19:8,46
TO THE, THROUGH BIRTH, THE JUVENILE THEN TO
THE ADULT.


234
0:19:8,46 --> 0:19:11,75
THERE IS A STAGE WHERE YOU CAN SEE VERY COMMON


235
0:19:11,75 --> 0:19:12,99
APPEARANCES AND STRUCTURES.


236
0:19:12,99 --> 0:19:18,32
NOW, IF WE LOOK AT SOME OF THESE STAGES,


237
0:19:18,32 --> 0:19:21,39
PARTICULAR PHYLOTYPIC STAGE, WHERE ALL THESE
THINGS


238
0:19:21,39 --> 0:19:23,64
THAT ARE VERY DIFFERENT IN THE ADULT FORM
LOOK VERY


239
0:19:23,64 --> 0:19:28,59
SIMILAR AS EMBRYOS, YOU CAN SEE PARTICULAR
STRUCTURES,


240
0:19:28,59 --> 0:19:31,59
THAT AS THEY DEVELOP FURTHER, TAKE ON VERY
DIFFERENT


241
0:19:31,59 --> 0:19:34,59
FUNCTIONS. THE EXAMPLE I HAVE GIVEN YOU HERE
IN THE


242
0:19:34,59 --> 0:19:36,87
COMPARING A CHICKEN AND A HUMAN EMBRYO IS
THE


243
0:19:36,87 --> 0:19:54,24
PHARYNGEAL POUCHES.
 WHICH YOU CAN SEE IN COMMON ACROSS ALL OF


244
0:19:54,24 --> 0:19:54,35
THE


245
0:19:54,35 --> 0:20:0,9
VERTEBRATE EMBRYOS. IN FISH, THAT GOES ON
TO FORM THE


246
0:20:0,9 --> 0:20:3,98
GILLS. YOU JUST FOLLOW THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE
BY STAGE


247
0:20:3,98 --> 0:20:8,919
BY STAGE. IN MAMMALS, IT IS GOING TO TURN
A DIFFERENT


248
0:20:8,919 --> 0:20:15,19
FUNCTION. IT IS NOW FORMING PART OF THE STRUCTURE
OF


249
0:20:15,19 --> 0:20:22,299
THE EARS AND THE THROAT. REALLY DIFFERENT
STRUCTURE


250
0:20:22,299 --> 0:20:26,909
IN THE ADULT FORM BUT THEY HAVE A COMMON DEVELOPMENTAL


251
0:20:26,909 --> 0:20:31,26
STAGE IN THESE PHARYNGEAL POUCHES. SO JUST
A FEW


252
0:20:31,26 --> 0:20:35,14
WEEKS AGO PEOPLE SORT OF WONDERED WHY DO YOU
START


253
0:20:35,14 --> 0:20:38,789
FROM A EGG THEN BECOME DIFFERENT AND SIMILAR
AGAIN AT


254
0:20:38,789 --> 0:20:41,88
THIS STAGE AND THEN BECOME DIFFERENT AGAIN?
AND JUST


255
0:20:41,88 --> 0:20:45,21
A FEW WEEKS AGO IN NATURE THERE WAS A SERIES
OF


256
0:20:45,21 --> 0:20:49,29
STUDIES WHERE THEY TOOK EMBRYOS AT EVERY STAGE
OF


257
0:20:49,29 --> 0:20:51,49
DEVELOPMENT. ONE GROUP DID IT IN VERTEBRATES,
IN


258
0:20:51,49 --> 0:20:54,679
ZEBRA FISH AND RELATIVES AND ANOTHER GROUP
DID IT IN


259
0:20:54,679 --> 0:20:58,429
DROSOPHILA OR FLIES. AND THEY FOUND THAT THE


260
0:20:58,429 --> 0:21:2,99
PHYLOTYPIC STAGE THESE THINGS LOOK SIMILAR,
MOST OF


261
0:21:2,99 --> 0:21:7,11
THE GENES THAT WERE EXPRESSED AT THIS STAGE,
GENES


262
0:21:7,11 --> 0:21:9,73
 THAT AROSE VERY EARLY IN THE DEVELOPMENT
OF THAT


263
0:21:9,73 --> 0:21:14,83
LINEAGE, ANCESTRAL GENES IF YOU LIKE. THIS
IS WHERE


264
0:21:14,83 --> 0:21:23,149
WE ARE GETTING ANCESTRAL GENES EXPRESSED.
AS YOU


265
0:21:23,149 --> 0:21:26,61
BECOME MORE AND MORE DIFFERENT LATER IN DEVELOPMENT


266
0:21:26,61 --> 0:21:29,61
YOU ARE GETTING NEWLY ARISEN NOVEL GENES BEING


267
0:21:29,61 --> 0:21:32,71
EXPRESSED. WE CAN UNDERSTAND THIS BY LOOKING
TO


268
0:21:32,71 --> 0:21:36,279
PHYLOGENY OF THE GENES. WHICH GENES WERE PRESENT
AND


269
0:21:36,279 --> 0:21:40,29
HAVE COMMON FUNCTION WAY BACK IN THE COMMON
ANCESTOR


270
0:21:40,29 --> 0:21:42,47
OF ALL OF THE VERTEBRATES OF A COMMON ANCESTOR
OF


271
0:21:42,47 --> 0:21:44,769
INSECTS. THE OTHER ONES THAT ARE EXPRESSED
AT THIS


272
0:21:44,769 --> 0:21:47,12
STAGE WHERE YOU GET SIMILAR STRUCTURES SORT
OF MAKES


273
0:21:47,12 --> 0:21:49,899
SENSE. ONLY RECENTLY WE HAVE GOTTEN THE DIRECT


274
0:21:49,899 --> 0:21:53,779
EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT. WE ARE GETTING AN IDEA
OF


275
0:21:53,779 --> 0:21:56,83
MECHANISMS THAT UNDERLIES THESE OBSERVATIONS
THAT HAVE


276
0:21:56,83 --> 0:22:2,429
BEEN MADE IN EMBRYOLOGY FOR 100 OR MORE YEARS.
PRETTY


277
0:22:2,429 --> 0:22:3,35
COOL.


278
0:22:3,35 --> 0:22:9,96
OKAY. WHAT ELSE HAVE I GOT THERE. THE NEXT


279
0:22:9,96 --> 0:22:13,2
SLIDE, SLIDE 6, AGAIN I WON'T DRAW IT OUT,
IS


280
0:22:13,2 --> 0:22:17,88
 MOLECULAR HOMOLOGIES. OF COURSE, DARWIN
DIDN'T KNOW


281
0:22:17,88 --> 0:22:21,929
ABOUT HOW INHERITANCE WORKED AND DNA. DIDN'T
KNOW


282
0:22:21,929 --> 0:22:25,7
ABOUT DEVELOPMENTAL PATHWAYS OF GENES. YET,
THE


283
0:22:25,7 --> 0:22:29,88
THEORY OF EVOLUTION THAT HE AND WALLACE PUT
FORWARD


284
0:22:29,88 --> 0:22:32,39
EXPLAINS A LOT OF NEW KNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE
GETTING


285
0:22:32,39 --> 0:22:35,7
FROM MOLECULAR BIOLOGY. OF THE SIMPLEST, THE
GENETIC


286
0:22:35,7 --> 0:22:40,179
CODE. THE WAY WE TRANSLATE FROM THE DNA SEQUENCE
TO


287
0:22:40,179 --> 0:22:44,74
AMINO ACIDS AND A PROTEIN IS IN COMMON ACROSS
THE


288
0:22:44,74 --> 0:22:49,74
EUKARYOTICS, PLANTS AND FUNGI AND ANIMALS.
IT IS


289
0:22:49,74 --> 0:22:51,779
COMMON BECAUSE THEY AROSE FROM A COMMON ANCESTOR.


290
0:22:51,779 --> 0:22:59,669
EVEN BETTER YOU CAN LOOK AT THE ARRANGEMENT
OF GENES


291
0:22:59,669 --> 0:23:4,32
IN PARTICULAR DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMS. YOU
SEE THE


292
0:23:4,32 --> 0:23:7,21
ARRANGEMENT OF GENES AND THEIR PATTERN OF
EXPRESSION


293
0:23:7,21 --> 0:23:10,11
IN THE EARLY EMBRYO IS THE SAME BETWEEN DROSOPHILA
AND


294
0:23:10,11 --> 0:23:14,99
MOUSE. YOU CAN TAKE ONE OF THESE GENES OUT
OF MOUSE


295
0:23:14,99 --> 0:23:19,809
AND RECOVER A MUTATION IN DROSOPHILA. SO THESE
ARE


296
0:23:19,809 --> 0:23:22,269
GENES THAT ARE DORSAL OR VENTRAL PATTERNING,
THAT IS,


297
0:23:22,269 --> 0:23:25,3
PICKING OUT WHICH PART OF THE EMBRYO WILL
BE THE


298
0:23:25,3 --> 0:23:27,539
 DORSAL OR TOP OR WHICH WILL BE THE BOTTOM,
VENTRAL.


299
0:23:27,539 --> 0:23:30,59
IT IS THE SAME DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAM WITH
SOME


300
0:23:30,59 --> 0:23:35,99
MODIFICATIONS IN INSECTS AS IT IS IN VERTEBRATES
IN


301
0:23:35,99 --> 0:23:39,539
MICE. YOU CAN SEE THAT WHEN YOU SEQUENCE THE
DNA.


302
0:23:39,539 --> 0:23:41,419
DARWIN DIDN'T USE THIS AS EVIDENCE BECAUSE
HE HAD NO


303
0:23:41,419 --> 0:23:45,39
CLUE ABOUT THIS. AS WE HAVE GONE ON GETTING
MORE AND


304
0:23:45,39 --> 0:23:48,639
MORE FROM DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY AND SO FORTH,
AGAIN,


305
0:23:48,639 --> 0:23:51,25
IT ALL MAKES SENSE IN TERMS OF THESE IDEAS
OF


306
0:23:51,25 --> 0:23:55,13
HOMOLOGIES AND MODIFICATION AND SO ON. IT
JUST GETS


307
0:23:55,13 --> 0:23:56,33
BETTER AND BETTER.


308
0:23:56,33 --> 0:23:59,8
SO PEOPLE WILL TALK ABOUT THE THEORY OF


309
0:23:59,8 --> 0:24:2,72
EVOLUTION. JUST A THEORY. JUST SOMEONE'S CRAZY
IDEA.


310
0:24:2,72 --> 0:24:7,649
THE MARK OF A THEORY THAT WORKS IS AS YOU
ACCUMULATE


311
0:24:7,649 --> 0:24:9,6
MORE AND MORE EVIDENCE THAT EXPLAINS MORE
AND MORE


312
0:24:9,6 --> 0:24:14,83
THINGS. AND PEOPLE TEST IT CRITICALLY AND
WE ARE


313
0:24:14,83 --> 0:24:18,48
STILL REFINING THE DETAILS BUT THE THEORY
ITSELF IS


314
0:24:18,48 --> 0:24:21,87
HELD UP SIMPLY AS THE BEST IDEA IN BIOLOGY.
IT


315
0:24:21,87 --> 0:24:28,85
EXPLAINS MOST OF ANY POSSIBLE THEORY. OKAY.
 BLAH BLAH BLAH. LET'S, I AM GETTING ON MY


316
0:24:28,85 --> 0:24:29,8
SOAP


317
0:24:29,8 --> 0:24:34,149
BOX AGAIN. I AM STARTING TO WAKE UP YOU SEE.
LET'S


318
0:24:34,149 --> 0:24:39,149
MOVE ON TO THIS IDEA OF THE TREE OF LIFE.
THIS


319
0:24:39,149 --> 0:24:41,279
CONCEPT OF HOMOLOGIES IS GOING TO COME UP
AGAIN AND


320
0:24:41,279 --> 0:24:45,769
AGAIN AS WE SEE WHAT IS THE TREE OF LIFE AND
HOW DO WE


321
0:24:45,769 --> 0:24:49,86
ESTIMATE IT AND HOW DO SCIENTISTS GO ABOUT


322
0:24:49,86 --> 0:25:15,8
UNDERSTANDING THE TREE OF LIFE. WHAT WE ARE
GOING TO


323
0:25:15,8 --> 0:25:24,769
TALK ABOUT IS ESTIMATING A PHYLOGENY


324
0:25:24,769 --> 0:25:25,6
AND THE BRANCH OF


325
0:25:25,6 --> 0:25:33,76
SCIENCE THAT DOES THIS IS CALLED SYSTEMATICS.


326
0:25:33,76 --> 0:25:37,6
DISCOVERING SPECIES ALL RELATED BACK INTO
THIS LARGER


327
0:25:37,6 --> 0:25:45,83
TREE OF LIFE. WHEN I WAS A LAD, WHICH WASN'T
SO LONG


328
0:25:45,83 --> 0:25:50,9
AGO, REALLY JUST A FEW WEEKS, WE THOUGHT THERE
WAS


329
0:25:50,9 --> 0:25:59,96
SORT OF THE PROKARYOTES, SINGLE CELLED ORGANISMS
WITH


330
0:25:59,96 --> 0:26:4,32
NO INTERNAL ORGANELLES AND SO FORTH. AND THEN
THE


331
0:26:4,32 --> 0:26:15,769
EUKARYOTES FOR THE ORGANISMS WITH INTRACELLULAR


332
0:26:15,769 --> 0:26:19,179
ORGANELLES, MITOCHONDRIA, CHLOROPLASTS, ENCLOSED


333
0:26:19,179 --> 0:26:23,12
NUCLEUS, ALL THAT STUFF. AND THEN WE SPLIT
THEM OUT


334
0:26:23,12 --> 0:26:36,84
INTO MAJOR GROUPS OF PLANTS, FUNGI, ANIMALS,
SINGLE


335
0:26:36,84 --> 0:26:40,96
 CELLED EUKARYOTES, WHICH WE CALLED THE PROTISTA.
WE


336
0:26:40,96 --> 0:26:44,899
WERE PRETTY SMART. WE THOUGH THAT WE HAD IT
NAILED.


337
0:26:44,899 --> 0:26:50,12
THIS SCHEME GOES WAY, WAY BACK TO LINNAEUS.
TURNS OUT


338
0:26:50,12 --> 0:26:55,22
WE ARE DEAD WRONG. MOST PEOPLE STARTED SEQUENCING


339
0:26:55,22 --> 0:27:0,32
HOMOLOGOUS GENES FROM ACROSS ALL OF LIFE.
THEN


340
0:27:0,32 --> 0:27:4,309
DISCOVERED WE HAVE THIS TOTALLY WRONG. TURNS
OUT


341
0:27:4,309 --> 0:27:8,48
THERE WERE 3 MAJOR DOMAINS OF LIFE. ONE IN


342
0:27:8,48 --> 0:27:13,679
EUKARYOTES, WE GO THE THAT RIGHTS. PROKARYOTES
WERE


343
0:27:13,679 --> 0:27:20,9
SPLIT INTO TWO FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT GROUPS.
THE


344
0:27:20,9 --> 0:27:31,88
ARCHAEA AND THE EUBACTERIA. AN EXAMPLE OF
EUBACTERIA


345
0:27:31,88 --> 0:27:36,779
IS E. COLI. IT IS INSIDE ALL OF YOU. IT IS
HUMAN


346
0:27:36,779 --> 0:27:41,99
COMMENSAL. AN EXAMPLE OF ARCHAEA'S ARE FIRMUS


347
0:27:41,99 --> 0:27:46,34
AQUATICUS. ANYONE EVER DONE PCR? ANY OF YOU
AT THIS


348
0:27:46,34 --> 0:27:50,929
STAGE? THIS SO-CALLED TEC ENZYME THAT YOU
USE AND


349
0:27:50,929 --> 0:27:54,259
WHICH WORKS AT VERY HIGH TEMPERATURES. THE
FIRMUS


350
0:27:54,259 --> 0:27:56,45
AQUATICUS, THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF ARCHAEA THAT
COMES


351
0:27:56,45 --> 0:28:0,399
FROM, TO US AT LEAST, TO AN EXTREME ENVIRONMENT.
IT


352
0:28:0,399 --> 0:28:3,86
WAS ISOLATED FROM THE HOT SPRINGS AT YELLOWSTONE
IN


353
0:28:3,86 --> 0:28:5,32
 WHICH YOU WOULDN'T THINK YOU COULD HAVE
NORMAL


354
0:28:5,32 --> 0:28:9,22
BIO-CHEMICAL PROCESSES. SO THESE ARCHAEA HAVE
TURNED


355
0:28:9,22 --> 0:28:15,669
UP IN A LOT OF, TO HUMANS, EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS.
TURNS


356
0:28:15,669 --> 0:28:18,58
OUT THEY WERE A RELATED GROUP VERY DISTINCT
FROM


357
0:28:18,58 --> 0:28:25,299
EUBACTERIA. SO THOSE THREE DIVISIONS SHOWN
ON THE


358
0:28:25,299 --> 0:28:31,36
LOWER LEFT, YOU CAN GET THIS NEST OF PATTERN
SO WITHIN


359
0:28:31,36 --> 0:28:38,29
THE EUCARYA, YOU HAVE PLANT, ANIMAL, FUNGI
AND THEN


360
0:28:38,29 --> 0:28:45,429
YOU HAVE SINGLE CELL, ANIMALS TO PROTISTS.
THEY ARE


361
0:28:45,429 --> 0:28:48,46
NOT A NATURAL GROUPING. THEN YOU SORT OF GO
IN


362
0:28:48,46 --> 0:28:51,419
FURTHER WITHIN THE TREE OF LIFE, HEADING UP
TOWARDS


363
0:28:51,419 --> 0:28:55,299
THE TIPS YOU COME TO THE (INAUDIBLE) YOU GO
IN FURTHER


364
0:28:55,299 --> 0:28:57,38
YOU COME TO THE VERTEBRATES AND YOU GO ON
FURTHER YOU


365
0:28:57,38 --> 0:29:0,34
COME TO THE MAMMALS YOU GO IN FURTHER COME
TO PRIMATES


366
0:29:0,34 --> 0:29:4,19
GO IN FURTHER COME TO HUMANS. (INAUDIBLE)
IS ONE


367
0:29:4,19 --> 0:29:10,96
LITTLE MISERABLE TWIG ON THE TREE OF LIFE.
THINK ABOUT


368
0:29:10,96 --> 0:29:13,34
THAT.


369
0:29:13,34 --> 0:29:14,71
AGAIN, THESE FIGURES COME DIRECTLY FROM THE


370
0:29:14,71 --> 0:29:19,35
UNDERSTANDING OF EVOLUTION WEBSITE. COOL RESOURCES
 THAT YOU CAN DO TO STEP THROUGH THIS TREE


371
0:29:19,35 --> 0:29:21,59
OF LIFE.


372
0:29:21,59 --> 0:29:24,269
WHAT EVIDENCE DO WE USE, WE DON'T JUST MAKE
THIS STUFF


373
0:29:24,269 --> 0:29:29,12
UP, HOW DO WE COME TO SOME HYPOTHESIS ABOUT
THE TREE


374
0:29:29,12 --> 0:29:32,759
OF LIFE? IT IS ALL ABOUT DEVELOPING AND TESTING


375
0:29:32,759 --> 0:29:35,509
HYPOTHESIS. WHAT IS THE SORT OF EVIDENCE THAT
WE CAN


376
0:29:35,509 --> 0:29:41,639
BRING TO BEAR. SO, IN GENERAL THERE ARE TWO
MAIN


377
0:29:41,639 --> 0:29:53,0
CLASSES OF EVIDENCE. MORPHOLOGY AND MOLECULES.


378
0:29:53,0 --> 0:29:55,21
MORPHOLOGY WAS THE MAIN SOURCE OF EVIDENCE
BACK


379
0:29:55,21 --> 0:30:0,149
IN DARWIN'S DAY. AND NOW THAT WE CAN SEQUENCE
DNA


380
0:30:0,149 --> 0:30:3,96
EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY, MOLECULES COME
IN AND


381
0:30:3,96 --> 0:30:10,96
THEY ARE BOTH IMPORTANT.


382
0:30:10,96 --> 0:30:15,58
WE CAN STUDY BOTH FOSSILS AND THE LIVING OR


383
0:30:15,58 --> 0:30:22,96
EXTANT SPECIES. SO, FOSSILS WE CAN GET MORPHOLOGY.


384
0:30:22,96 --> 0:30:28,909
NO PROBLEM. EXTANT FORMS WE CAN GET MORPHOLOGY
AND WE


385
0:30:28,909 --> 0:30:33,45
CAN ALSO SEQUENCE MOLECULES FROM THE LIVING
TAXA. IN


386
0:30:33,45 --> 0:30:39,1
SOME CASES FOR FAIRLY RECENT FOSSILS AND RECENTLY


387
0:30:39,1 --> 0:30:45,74
EXTINCT FORMS WE CAN ALSO GET MOLECULAR DATA.
IN


388
0:30:45,74 --> 0:30:50,49
FACT, WHOLE GENOMES. THAT IS, REALLY TECHNOLOGY
HAS


389
0:30:50,49 --> 0:30:54,2
 EVOLVED THE LAST FEW YEARS. YOU CAN'T DO
IT WITH THE


390
0:30:54,2 --> 0:30:57,259
THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR MORE THAN A
MILLION OR


391
0:30:57,259 --> 0:30:58,549
SO YEARS.


392
0:30:58,549 --> 0:31:2,12
SO EACH OF THESE ALSO BRINGS SOME ADDITIONAL


393
0:31:2,12 --> 0:31:7,57
INFORMATION. AGAIN, WITH THE FOSSILS, WE CAN
GET AT


394
0:31:7,57 --> 0:31:12,639
ANCESTORS. WE CAN LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE ANCESTORS


395
0:31:12,639 --> 0:31:15,769
GOING BACK ON THIS TREE OF LIFE, IF WE HAVE
ENOUGH


396
0:31:15,769 --> 0:31:18,559
FOSSIL EVIDENCE, AND LOOK AT THE CHARACTERISTIC
THEY


397
0:31:18,559 --> 0:31:23,919
HAVE PARTICULARLY FOR MORPHOLOGY. IT ALSO
GIVES US


398
0:31:23,919 --> 0:31:28,7
SOME ESTIMATE OF TIME. WHEN DID THOSE ANCESTOR'S


399
0:31:28,7 --> 0:31:32,19
EXIST FOR THE COMMON TAXA. SO WHEN WAS THE
COMMON


400
0:31:32,19 --> 0:31:36,34
ANCESTOR FOR HUMAN AND CHIMPANZEE. WITHOUT
FOSSILS WE


401
0:31:36,34 --> 0:31:39,799
CAN'T REALLY NAIL THAT DOWN AND THERE IS A
BIG GROUP


402
0:31:39,799 --> 0:31:43,37
OF PEOPLE HERE WHO WORK ON THAT.


403
0:31:43,37 --> 0:31:46,269
FOR THE EXTANT TAXA, WE CAN AS I WILL EXPLAIN
A


404
0:31:46,269 --> 0:31:50,34
LITTLE BIT LATER, WE CAN ALSO GET AN ESTIMATE
OF TIME


405
0:31:50,34 --> 0:31:53,0
AS WELL AS RELATIONSHIPS. BUT, WE CAN'T DIRECTLY
SEE


406
0:31:53,0 --> 0:31:57,629
THE ANCESTORS. BUT WE NEED THE FOSSILS TO
DO THAT.


407
0:31:57,629 --> 0:32:0,259
 WE DON'T JUST USE ONE LINE OF EVIDENCE WE
USE MULTIPLE


408
0:32:0,259 --> 0:32:4,559
LINES OF EVIDENCE. NOW, I NEED TO INTRODUCE
YOU TO


409
0:32:4,559 --> 0:32:7,389
SOME PRINCIPLES AND TERMINOLOGY THAT WILL
COME UP IN


410
0:32:7,389 --> 0:32:7,809
YOUR LAB.


411
0:32:7,809 --> 0:32:15,73
THERE CAN BE A LOT OF WORDS BANDIED ABOUT.
SO


412
0:32:15,73 --> 0:32:25,149
THE PRINCIPLES ARE FIRST, THAT WE, OUR HYPOTHESIS
OF


413
0:32:25,149 --> 0:32:29,95
PHYLOGENY IS BASES ON SHARED, DERIVED CHARACTERS.
I


414
0:32:29,95 --> 0:32:37,85
WILL EXPLAIN WHAT THIS IS IN A MINUTE. WE
USE SHARED,


415
0:32:37,85 --> 0:32:44,99
DERIVED STATES OF CHARACTERS TO GROUP TAXA.
WE WILL


416
0:32:44,99 --> 0:32:49,74
SEE AN EXAMPLE IN A MINUTE. DON'T PANIC. SECOND


417
0:32:49,74 --> 0:32:55,149
PRINCIPLE IS THAT WE SHOULD GROUP FORMS INTO
SPECIES


418
0:32:55,149 --> 0:32:58,519
OR GENERA OR CLADES THAT ARE MONOPHYLETIC.


419
0:32:58,519 --> 0:33:10,169
SO WHAT THE HELL IS THAT I HEAR YOU ASK?


420
0:33:10,169 --> 0:33:15,71
DID I HEAR YOU ASK? GOOD. VERY GOOD. OKAY.


421
0:33:15,71 --> 0:33:22,309
SO LET'S LOOK AT A DIAGRAM. THESE ARE STATES
NOT


422
0:33:22,309 --> 0:33:27,539
STATICS. MY WRITING IS TERRIBLE. SO, LET'S
DRAW A


423
0:33:27,539 --> 0:33:32,289
PHYLOGENY. I WILL REFER TO SLIDE NUMBER 9.
THIS IS


424
0:33:32,289 --> 0:33:36,71
ALSO IN YOUR TEXT BOOK.
 JUST TO CONFUSE YOU, I WILL DRAW IT SIDEWAYS


425
0:33:36,71 --> 0:33:38,49
BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT TO BE EASIER FOR WHAT
I WANT TO


426
0:33:38,49 --> 0:33:38,5
DO.


427
0:33:38,5 --> 0:33:46,809
SO HERE WE HAVE THE LIMITED FORM. J AND K.


428
0:33:46,809 --> 0:33:52,919
THEY HAVE A COMMON ANCESTOR. I.


429
0:33:52,919 --> 0:34:0,58
OVER HERE WE HAVE GOT SOME MORE LIVING FORMS
G,


430
0:34:0,58 --> 0:34:6,2
H, G, E AND D. THESE GUYS HAVE A COMMON ANCESTOR


431
0:34:6,2 --> 0:34:9,52
CALLED C. THIS ONE HAS A COMMON ANCESTOR CALLED
F.


432
0:34:9,52 --> 0:34:12,99
HERE YOU HAVE COMMON ANCESTOR CALLED B. IT
WILL ALL


433
0:34:12,99 --> 0:34:15,85
MAKE SENSE IN A MINUTE. COMMON ANCESTOR THERE
CALLED


434
0:34:15,85 --> 0:34:19,64
A.


435
0:34:19,64 --> 0:34:22,8
REMEMBER TO START, WE DON'T KNOW THIS GENEALOGY.


436
0:34:22,8 --> 0:34:25,81
WE DON'T KNOW THIS HISTORY. BUT WE WILL START
AS IF


437
0:34:25,81 --> 0:34:28,6
WE DO KNOW IT AND WORK BACKWARDS TO EXPLAIN
WHAT I


438
0:34:28,6 --> 0:34:35,55
MEAN BY A SHARED DERIVED STATE OR MONOPHYLETIC.
SAY


439
0:34:35,55 --> 0:34:38,91
YOU HAVE A CHANGE IN THE MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTIC.


440
0:34:38,91 --> 0:34:49,46
HERE, IT GOES FROM STATE A TO STATE B. SO
THESE ARE


441
0:34:49,46 --> 0:34:54,76
ALL TAXA SPECIES GENERA, WHATEVER LEVEL YOU
ARE


442
0:34:54,76 --> 0:34:54,97
 WORKING AT.


443
0:34:54,97 --> 0:35:8,14
A, B AND C ARE STATES FOR A PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTIC.


444
0:35:8,14 --> 0:35:13,17
PRESENCE OF NAILS, EVOLUTION OF LIMBS, WHATEVER.
THEY


445
0:35:13,17 --> 0:35:18,45
ARE HOMOLOGOUS. DIFFERENT STATES OF THE HOMOLOGOUS


446
0:35:18,45 --> 0:35:22,4
CHARACTERISTIC. SO, GOING BACK TO VERTEBRATE,
YOU


447
0:35:22,4 --> 0:35:26,83
HAVE GOT A FLIPPER, YOU HAVE GOT A WING, YOU
HAVE GOT


448
0:35:26,83 --> 0:35:31,6
A LEG, A FOREARM, AND SO ON. THEY ARE ALL
STATES OF


449
0:35:31,6 --> 0:35:36,25
THAT HOMOLOGOUS CHARACTERISTIC WHICH IS A
VERTEBRATE


450
0:35:36,25 --> 0:35:40,67
FOUR LIMB. SO HERE, YOU HAVE GONE FROM STATE
A, WHICH


451
0:35:40,67 --> 0:35:44,9
IS ANCESTRRAL FORM AND ANCESTRAL STATE TO
STATE B THAT


452
0:35:44,9 --> 0:35:47,49
IS A SHARED DERIVED CHARACTERISTIC BECAUSE
ALL OF


453
0:35:47,49 --> 0:35:54,3
THESE FORMS, LET ME FINISH THE DIAGRAM BECAUSE
IT WILL


454
0:35:54,3 --> 0:35:58,32
GET A LITTLE MORE CONFUSING. HERE WE ARE GOING
TO


455
0:35:58,32 --> 0:36:3,71
CHANGE B TO C. SO WE LOOK ACROSS THESE DIFFERENT


456
0:36:3,71 --> 0:36:10,72
CHARACTERISTICS, WHAT WE ACTUALLY SEE IS A.
LET'S TRY


457
0:36:10,72 --> 0:36:15,82
TO GET THIS RIGHT; B, B, C, C. THAT IS WHAT
WE


458
0:36:15,82 --> 0:36:27,95
OBSERVE. NOT JUST ONE CHARACTERISTIC BUT HUNDREDS.


459
0:36:27,95 --> 0:36:36,21
SO, IN THIS CASE B AND C ARE SHARED, DERIVED
 CHARACTERISTICS. B IS SHARED BETWEEN THESE


460
0:36:36,21 --> 0:36:36,84
TWO AND C


461
0:36:36,84 --> 0:36:40,18
IS SHARED BETWEEN THESE TWO. BUT, IF WE HAVE
FOSSILS


462
0:36:40,18 --> 0:36:44,93
WE CAN SEE THAT A TURNED TO B BACK HERE AND
B TURNED


463
0:36:44,93 --> 0:36:52,73
TO C HERE. THESE ARE SHARED DERIVED STATES.


464
0:36:52,73 --> 0:36:55,79
JUST TO COMPLICATE THINGS FURTHER BECAUSE
I LOVE


465
0:36:55,79 --> 0:37:2,36
COMPLEXITY. IMAGINE UP HERE YOU HAVE A INDEPENDENTLY


466
0:37:2,36 --> 0:37:10,76
GIVE RISE TO THE STATE C. LET'S CALL IT C
STAR. IT


467
0:37:10,76 --> 0:37:14,58
IS NOT REALLY THE SAME THING. IT JUST LOOKS
LIKE IT.


468
0:37:14,58 --> 0:37:19,81
SO, IN THIS CASE A B AND C ARE THE SHARED,
DERIVED


469
0:37:19,81 --> 0:37:24,64
STATE. THEY ARE HOMOLOGOUS. C STAR IS ANALAGOUS.


470
0:37:24,64 --> 0:37:30,37
ARISEN QUITE INDEPENDENTLY IN EVOLUTION. SO,
INSTEAD


471
0:37:30,37 --> 0:37:35,51
OF SHARED, DERIVED STATE, IT MAY LOOK LIKE
IT BUT, IF


472
0:37:35,51 --> 0:37:38,58
YOU LOOK AT ENOUGH CHARACTERISTICS YOU SEE
THIS


473
0:37:38,58 --> 0:37:41,41
ARRANGEMENT COMING OUT IN COMMON SO THEN YOU
KNOW THAT


474
0:37:41,41 --> 0:37:46,16
IN FACT J IS NOT RELATED TO THESE. IN FACT
IT IS


475
0:37:46,16 --> 0:37:50,12
RELATED TO K THEN YOU CAN BACK OUT AND THEN
YOU SEE


476
0:37:50,12 --> 0:37:53,79
THIS ONE IS HAS RISEN INDEPENDENTLY. SO THE
IDEA HERE


477
0:37:53,79 --> 0:37:58,109
OF HOMOLOGOUS CHARACTERS, SHARED, DERIVED
STATES AND


478
0:37:58,109 --> 0:38:0,86
 TRYING TO ASSEMBLE FROM A WHOLE RANGE OF


479
0:38:0,86 --> 0:38:5,51
CHARACTERISTICS THE TRUE HISTORY. WE ARE ESTIMATING.


480
0:38:5,51 --> 0:38:6,38
IT IS A HYPOTHESIS.


481
0:38:6,38 --> 0:38:13,87
AGAIN, WE WILL LOOK AT SOME EXAMPLES OF THIS
IN


482
0:38:13,87 --> 0:38:16,5
A MINUTE. I WANT TO INTRODUCE TO A COUPLE
MORE TERMS.


483
0:38:16,5 --> 0:38:21,49
SO, A MONOPHYLETIC GROUP IS A GROUP OF TAXA
THAT


484
0:38:21,49 --> 0:38:23,75
CONTAINS ALL OF THE DESCENDENTS FROM A PARTICULAR


485
0:38:23,75 --> 0:38:31,84
COMMON ANCESTOR. SO, D AND E IS A MONOPHYLETIC
GROUP.


486
0:38:31,84 --> 0:38:35,82
THESE HAVE COMMON ANCESTOR C AND THE GROUP
INCLUDES


487
0:38:35,82 --> 0:38:43,13
ALL OF THE LIVING DESCENDANTS FROM THAT GROUP.
THIS


488
0:38:43,13 --> 0:38:47,94
IS A MONOPHYLETIC GROUP. H, G, D, AND E ALL
HAVE A


489
0:38:47,94 --> 0:38:52,33
COMMON ANCESTOR B BACK HERE. AND THAT GROUP
CONTAINS


490
0:38:52,33 --> 0:38:56,45
ALL OF THE DESCENDANTS FROM THAT COMMON ANCESTOR.
IF


491
0:38:56,45 --> 0:39:4,4
YOU LIKE, THIS IS MONOPHYLETIC GROUPS. NOW
THERE ARE


492
0:39:4,4 --> 0:39:8,41
OTHER COMBINATIONS OF TAXA YOU CAN IMAGINE
HERE THAT


493
0:39:8,41 --> 0:39:12,4
DOESN'T HOLD TRUE. SO, IMAGINE IF YOU HAD
TO, MAKE


494
0:39:12,4 --> 0:39:17,12
SURE IT IS SAME AS THE SLIDE, IMAGINE YOU
HAD THIS


495
0:39:17,12 --> 0:39:28,26
GROUP OF TAXA. H G AND E. THAT IS NOT A MONOPHYLETIC
 GROUP BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T INCLUDED D. THIS


496
0:39:28,26 --> 0:39:28,64
IS CALLED


497
0:39:28,64 --> 0:39:36,18
A PARAPHYLETIC GROUP. THEY HAVE A COMMON ANCESTOR,


498
0:39:36,18 --> 0:39:39,25
BUT THAT GROUPING DOESN'T INCLUDE ALL OF THE
OF


499
0:39:39,25 --> 0:39:46,16
PERCENTAGE FROM THE COMMON ANCESTOR.


500
0:39:46,16 --> 0:39:46,53
YOU CAN ALSO


501
0:39:46,53 --> 0:39:54,8
IMAGINE ANOTHER GROUPING HERE OF THIS PLUS
D AND E. J


502
0:39:54,8 --> 0:40:3,52
K E AND D DON'T HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE COMMON ANCESTOR.


503
0:40:3,52 --> 0:40:6,13
THIS WHOLE GROUP HAS A COMMON ANCESTOR BACK
HERE BUT


504
0:40:6,13 --> 0:40:9,5
IF YOU JUST GROUP THESE SPECIES YOU ARE EMITTING
THESE


505
0:40:9,5 --> 0:40:12,97
TWO WHICH HAVE A COMMON ANCESTOR. THIS IS
CALLED


506
0:40:12,97 --> 0:40:20,21
POLYPHYLETIC.


507
0:40:20,21 --> 0:40:22,8
AS J AND K HAVE ARISEN INDEPENDENTLY OF


508
0:40:22,8 --> 0:40:29,41
A AND D. THE HISTORY OF LIFE. BELIEVE ME I
AM BEING


509
0:40:29,41 --> 0:40:32,5
GENTLE. A LOT OF THIS FIELD WAS INVENTED BY
GERMANS


510
0:40:32,5 --> 0:40:35,49
AND THERE IS A REALLY HORRENDOUS SET OF TERMINOLOGY


511
0:40:35,49 --> 0:40:39,16
THAT GOES WITH IT. YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND
THE


512
0:40:39,16 --> 0:40:43,46
PRINCIPLE THAT TAXA, SPECIES, GENERA, FAMILIES,
SHOULD


513
0:40:43,46 --> 0:40:47,61
BE MONOPHYLETIC. THAT IS WHAT I MEAN HERE.
GROUPING


514
0:40:47,61 --> 0:40:50,36
OF TAXA SHOULD INCLUDE ALL OF THE DESCENDANTS
FROM THE


515
0:40:50,36 --> 0:40:53,59
COMMON ANCESTOR. AND WE DEFINE THEM BY THE
PRESENCE


516
0:40:53,59 --> 0:41:0,75
 OF SHARED DERIVED TRAITS. THAT IS WHAT THIS
IS.


517
0:41:0,75 --> 0:41:2,35
LET'S LOOK AT A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES AND I WILL


518
0:41:2,35 --> 0:41:5,77
STOP AND TAKE QUESTIONS. I THINK EXAMPLES,
THIS IS A


519
0:41:5,77 --> 0:41:9,83
VERY ABSTRACT KIND OF, EXAMPLES MIGHT HELP
MAKE IT


520
0:41:9,83 --> 0:41:15,1
MORE TANGIBLE. SLIDE 10, I WILL NOT DRAW THIS
ON THE


521
0:41:15,1 --> 0:41:22,1
BOARD, WE HAVE THE ESTIMATED PHYLOGENY OF
MAJOR GROUPS


522
0:41:22,1 --> 0:41:32,69
OF VERTEBRATES OR IS THAT CHORDATES?


523
0:41:32,69 --> 0:41:34,1
WE HAVE THE


524
0:41:34,1 --> 0:41:38,85
OUTSIDE OF THE GROUP HISTORY OF, WE HAVE THE
NEXT


525
0:41:38,85 --> 0:41:45,53
LETTER WHICH IS CALLED THE OUT-GROUP. IN THIS
CASE IT


526
0:41:45,53 --> 0:41:51,18
IS A CHORDATE, THE LANCELET. THEN WE HAVE
THE


527
0:41:51,18 --> 0:41:54,43
DIFFERENT MAJOR GROUPS OF VERTEBRATES; WE
HAVE GOT THE


528
0:41:54,43 --> 0:42:1,29
LAMPREY, THE FISH, AMPHIBIANS, REPTILES AND
MAMMALS.


529
0:42:1,29 --> 0:42:6,7
BIRDS, BY THE WAY, ARE JUST FLYING REPTILES.
THEY ARE


530
0:42:6,7 --> 0:42:11,81
NOT A SEPARATE GROUP AS WAS LONG THOUGHT.
WHAT IS


531
0:42:11,81 --> 0:42:17,49
SHOWN HERE ON THE LEFT IS A CHARACTER MATRIX.
SO FOR


532
0:42:17,49 --> 0:42:20,99
A PARTICULAR SET OF CHARACTERISTICS, I SHOULD
HAVE


533
0:42:20,99 --> 0:42:25,89
PRINTED THIS LARGER, HINGED JAWS, WALKING
LEGS, HAIR


534
0:42:25,89 --> 0:42:31,7
AND SO ON, SHOWS WHERE THOSE PARTICULAR TRAITS
ARE


535
0:42:31,7 --> 0:42:35,29
 PRESENT ACROSS A GROUP OF ORGANISMS. ON
THE RIGHT IS


536
0:42:35,29 --> 0:42:38,3
PHYLOGENY WHICH SHOWS YOU THE CHARACTER STATE
THAT


537
0:42:38,3 --> 0:42:45,59
UNITE GROUPS OR CLADES. HERE IS ANOTHER TERM.
WE


538
0:42:45,59 --> 0:42:50,2
CALL THESE GROUPINGS CLADES. MONOPHYLETIC
CLADES.


539
0:42:50,2 --> 0:42:56,49
THE CLADE IS A GROUP OF TAXA. YOU CAN SEE,
AS YOU GO


540
0:42:56,49 --> 0:43:2,25
THROUGH THAT, THAT ALL OF THE VERTEBRATES
SHARE A


541
0:43:2,25 --> 0:43:6,71
VERTEBRAL COLUMN. THAT IS A SHARED DERIVED


542
0:43:6,71 --> 0:43:11,94
CHARACTERISTIC STATE, IF YOU LIKE, THAT DEFINES
ALL OF


543
0:43:11,94 --> 0:43:14,2
THE VERTEBRATES. THE NEXT GROUPING IN, THE
BONY FISH


544
0:43:14,2 --> 0:43:19,92
AND THE REST HAVE HINGED JAWS. SHARED, DERIVED
STATE


545
0:43:19,92 --> 0:43:22,91
OF JAWS.


546
0:43:22,91 --> 0:43:24,89
THE TETRAPODS, THE AMPHIBIANS, THE BIRDS,
THE


547
0:43:24,89 --> 0:43:31,67
MAMMALS AND REPTILES, ALL HAVE FOUR LIMBED
LEGS. THAT


548
0:43:31,67 --> 0:43:37,14
IS WHY THEY ARE CALLED TETRAPODS. REPTILES
INCLUDING,


549
0:43:37,14 --> 0:43:45,21
BIRDS AND MAMMALS ALL HAVE AN AMNIOTIC EGG.
MAMMALS


550
0:43:45,21 --> 0:43:50,3
ALL SHARE THE CHARACTERISTIC OF HAIR WHICH
IS MODIFIED


551
0:43:50,3 --> 0:43:55,25
IN OTHER ORGANISMS, THAT IS SCALES. IN MAMMALS
IT IS


552
0:43:55,25 --> 0:44:4,74
HAIR. A SHARED DERIVED STATE. OKAY. SO, THESE
 PRINCIPLES WILL BE REINFORCED IN THE LAB.


553
0:44:4,74 --> 0:44:5,53
BUT, I


554
0:44:5,53 --> 0:44:8,7
WANTED YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE TERMINOLOGY
AS WELL AS


555
0:44:8,7 --> 0:44:14,76
THESE MAJOR PRINCIPLES. SO, WE CAN ESTIMATE
PHYLOGENY


556
0:44:14,76 --> 0:44:18,8
GIVEN NOT JUST THIS MISERABLE 4 OR 5 CHARACTERS
BUT


557
0:44:18,8 --> 0:44:23,11
HUNDREDS OF THEM. CONSIDERING THE DEVELOPMENTAL


558
0:44:23,11 --> 0:44:26,98
PATHWAYS AND THE FOSSIL RECORD TO IDENTIFY
HOMOLOGOUS


559
0:44:26,98 --> 0:44:31,99
RESTRUCTURE, HOMOLOGOUS AND SHARED ANCESTORS
AND


560
0:44:31,99 --> 0:44:35,92
FINDING TRANSITIONAL STATES, AND SO ON. OTHER
EVIDENCE


561
0:44:35,92 --> 0:44:40,47
THAT HAS COME TO THE FLOOR, IS DNA SEQUENCE
VARIATION.


562
0:44:40,47 --> 0:44:43,74
HOW DO WE TREAT THAT?


563
0:44:43,74 --> 0:45:2,92
DNA SEQUENCES. SO WE CAN TAKE THE PARTICULAR


564
0:45:2,92 --> 0:45:7,7
GENE, THE SAME GENE ACROSS ALL VERTEBRATES,
ACROSS ALL


565
0:45:7,7 --> 0:45:13,23
OF LIFE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE RIBOSOMAL RNA GENES
THAT


566
0:45:13,23 --> 0:45:16,1
ENCODE PART OF THE RIBOSOME THAT IS IN ALL
OF THE


567
0:45:16,1 --> 0:45:19,42
CELLS OF THE ORGANISMS, CAN BE SEQUENCED ACROSS
ALL OF


568
0:45:19,42 --> 0:45:25,14
LIFE. OF COURSE, THERE ARE 4 DIFFERENT NUCLEOTIDES
IN


569
0:45:25,14 --> 0:45:25,96
THE DNA.


570
0:45:25,96 --> 0:45:37,8
A T C AND G. ADENINE, THYMINE, CYTOSINE,
 GUANINE. SO THEY ARE AT DIFFERENT STATES.


571
0:45:37,8 --> 0:45:38,66
SO THEY


572
0:45:38,66 --> 0:45:44,55
HAVE A SEQUENCE AT A T A C G. IN A PARTICULAR


573
0:45:44,55 --> 0:45:48,86
ORGANISM WE SEQUENCE THAT SAME PART OF THE
GENE FROM


574
0:45:48,86 --> 0:45:56,4
A DIFFERENT ORGANISM, A T C C G T. WE LINE
THESE


575
0:45:56,4 --> 0:45:59,62
SEQUENCES UP SO THAT ALL OF THE POSITIONS
CORRESPOND.


576
0:45:59,62 --> 0:46:4,33
THAT IS THIS IS A HOMOLOGOUS BASE WITHIN THAT
GENE.


577
0:46:4,33 --> 0:46:7,86
IT IS THE SAME BASE POSITION IN ALL OF THESE
TAXA. SO


578
0:46:7,86 --> 0:46:10,98
IN THIS CASE, THIS IS NOT VERY FORMED THAT
THESE TWO


579
0:46:10,98 --> 0:46:15,52
HAVE THE SAME STATE. BUT SOMEWHERE BACK IN
THE


580
0:46:15,52 --> 0:46:18,62
HISTORY OF LIFE THERE HAS BEEN A MUTATION
AND YOU CAN


581
0:46:18,62 --> 0:46:21,69
FIGURE OUT WHICH WAY BY SEQUENCING THE OUT-GROUP


582
0:46:21,69 --> 0:46:25,49
SOMETHING OUTSIDE OF THAT. HERE IS ANOTHER
ONE. SO


583
0:46:25,49 --> 0:46:30,3
THESE ARE DIFFERENT STATES OF THAT BASE POSITION
IN


584
0:46:30,3 --> 0:46:33,85
THAT GENE.


585
0:46:33,85 --> 0:46:37,3
SO SLIDE 11 SHOWS YOU A MATRIX, JUST A MADE
UP


586
0:46:37,3 --> 0:46:42,91
ONE. SO ACROSS THE TOP IS THIS BASICALLY,
JUST A FEW


587
0:46:42,91 --> 0:46:46,95
MORE LINES OF THIS STUFF ACROSS DIFFERENT
SPECIES.


588
0:46:46,95 --> 0:46:50,61
AND THEN YOU SEE THE STATES IN THE GENE. AND
ON THE


589
0:46:50,61 --> 0:46:53,87
 BOTTOM IS THE INFERRED PHYLOGENY BASED ON
THESE


590
0:46:53,87 --> 0:46:57,25
CHARACTERISTICS AND MANY OTHERS. YOU CAN DO
THIS FOR


591
0:46:57,25 --> 0:47:1,53
WHOLE GENOMES NOW, MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF
BASE PAIRS


592
0:47:1,53 --> 0:47:4,48
IN GENES.


593
0:47:4,48 --> 0:47:6,47
SO, HOW DO WE ESTIMATE THAT TREE IN THERE
ARE


594
0:47:6,47 --> 0:47:11,62
TWO METHODS THAT ARE IN USE. A LOT OF THIS
IS


595
0:47:11,62 --> 0:47:16,23
ACTUALLY DEVELOPED BY, WE HAVE SOME OF THE
WORLD


596
0:47:16,23 --> 0:47:18,46
LEADERS IN DEVELOPING THIS STUFF HERE. PARTICULARITY


597
0:47:18,46 --> 0:47:25,39
JOHN HUELSONBECK AND OTHER PEOPLE. JOHN HAS
SHOWN ON


598
0:47:25,39 --> 0:47:28,78
THIS SLIDE THAT THERE ARE TWO BASIC PROCESSES.
REASON


599
0:47:28,78 --> 0:47:31,82
I PUT JOHN HERE, HE TEACHES BIO 1B IN THE
FALL. I


600
0:47:31,82 --> 0:47:39,68
TEACH IT IN THE SPRING. KIND OF FUN. BASICALLY,
TWO


601
0:47:39,68 --> 0:47:42,49
DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO ANALYZING THIS DATA
TO


602
0:47:42,49 --> 0:47:45,4
ESTIMATE THE PHYLOGENETIC TREE. ONE IS THE
PRINCIPLE


603
0:47:45,4 --> 0:47:49,29
OF PARSIMONY. ACROSS ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT


604
0:47:49,29 --> 0:47:52,94
CHARACTERS AND STATES WE WANT TO ESTIMATE
THE


605
0:47:52,94 --> 0:47:55,61
RELATIONSHIPS THAT MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF
EVOLUTION


606
0:47:55,61 --> 0:48:2,74
THAT YOU NEED TO PROPOSE. SO, BASICALLY YOU
MINIMIZE


607
0:48:2,74 --> 0:48:8,3
 THE AMOUNT OF CHANGE. IN DNA SEQUENCE OR


608
0:48:8,3 --> 0:48:12,43
MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS ACROSS THAT SORT
OF TAXA. SO


609
0:48:12,43 --> 0:48:16,3
THE TREE THAT HAS THE SMALLEST AMOUNT OF EVOLUTION
ON


610
0:48:16,3 --> 0:48:18,69
IT IS THE FAVORED TREE. IT IS THE SIMPLEST


611
0:48:18,69 --> 0:48:22,24
EXPLANATION OF THE DATA. WE ALWAYS TRY TO
HAVE THE


612
0:48:22,24 --> 0:48:27,17
SIMPLEST EXPLANATION. THAT IS WHY IT IS CALLED


613
0:48:27,17 --> 0:48:29,4
PARSIMONY. SIMPLEST POSSIBLE EXPLANATION OF
THE DATA.


614
0:48:29,4 --> 0:48:32,96
THERE ARE COMPUTER PROGRAMS THAT DO THIS.
YOU


615
0:48:32,96 --> 0:48:36,42
WILL WORK THROUGH SOME EXAMPLES IN YOUR LAB.
THE


616
0:48:36,42 --> 0:48:43,62
OTHER APPROACH IS MORE STATISTICAL.


617
0:48:43,62 --> 0:48:44,99
WHERE WE HAVE THE


618
0:48:44,99 --> 0:48:47,67
SAME GENERAL AIM OF TRYING TO FIND THE TREE
THAT BEST


619
0:48:47,67 --> 0:48:52,65
EXPLAINS THE DATA, BUT WE BRING INTO IT, PARTICULARLY


620
0:48:52,65 --> 0:48:55,37
FOR DNA SEQUENCES, WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE
MODEL OF


621
0:48:55,37 --> 0:48:57,6
SEQUENCE EVOLUTION. HOW DOES THE MUTATION
PROCESS


622
0:48:57,6 --> 0:49:2,31
WORK? SOME TYPES OF MUTATION THAT ARE MORE
COMMON BY


623
0:49:2,31 --> 0:49:5,81
CHEMICALLY THAN OTHER TYPES OF MUTATIONS.
HERE WE


624
0:49:5,81 --> 0:49:9,36
BRING IN AND TRY TO MINIMIZE CHANGE, BUT ALSO
BRING IN


625
0:49:9,36 --> 0:49:18,58
A STATISTICAL MODEL OF HOW SEQUENCES EVOLVE.
AND YOU


626
0:49:18,58 --> 0:49:22,19
 CAN DO THAT BY SEEING WHAT TYPES OF MUTATIONS
ARE MOST


627
0:49:22,19 --> 0:49:25,37
COMMON AND THEN APPLY THAT KNOWLEDGE TO IMPROVE
YOUR


628
0:49:25,37 --> 0:49:30,87
ESTIMATE OF RELATIONSHIPS. A VERY SIMPLE WAY
TO DO


629
0:49:30,87 --> 0:49:32,99
THIS IS JUST TO LOOK AT HOW MUCH DIFFERENCE
THERE IS


630
0:49:32,99 --> 0:49:37,6
IN A GENE. IS THERE 1 PERCENT DIFFERENT, 20
PERCENT


631
0:49:37,6 --> 0:49:39,43
DIFFERENT, 30 PERCENT DIFFERENCE IN ALL OF
THE


632
0:49:39,43 --> 0:49:43,41
PAIRWISE COMBINATIONS OF GENES. YOU MIGHT
TRY TO


633
0:49:43,41 --> 0:49:45,81
ESTIMATE THE TREE WHICH ONE HAS THE LARGEST
AMOUNT OF


634
0:49:45,81 --> 0:49:51,29
CHANGE GIVEN THE MODEL OF SEQUENCE EVOLUTION.
THIS IS


635
0:49:51,29 --> 0:49:53,67
SOPHISTICATED STATISTICAL SCIENCE. FOR EXAMPLE,
AT


636
0:49:53,67 --> 0:49:57,61
THE BOTTOM OF SLIDE 12 ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE
THERE IS


637
0:49:57,61 --> 0:50:0,81
A TREE SHOWING SOMETHING THAT IS IMPLAUSIBLE.
IT IS A


638
0:50:0,81 --> 0:50:2,81
POOR EXPLANATION OF THE DATA BECAUSE THE BRANCH


639
0:50:2,81 --> 0:50:6,8
LENGTHS ARE ALL SKEWED. THEY ARE ALL OVER
THE PLACE.


640
0:50:6,8 --> 0:50:8,41
SO, IN THAT CASE, JOHN HUELSENBECK, SHOWN
IN THE


641
0:50:8,41 --> 0:50:13,92
PHOTOGRAPH, IS MOST CLOSELY RELATED TO A PLANT.
BEST


642
0:50:13,92 --> 0:50:16,69
ESTIMATE OF PHYLOGENY IS THAT JOHN HUELSENBECK
IS MOST


643
0:50:16,69 --> 0:50:20,44
CLOSELY RELATED TO A FUNGUS WITH THE PLANT
BEING THE


644
0:50:20,44 --> 0:50:25,23
 MORE DISTANT RELATIVE. EXPLAINS A LOT ABOUT
JOHN


645
0:50:25,23 --> 0:50:34,7
HEULSENBECK. TO FINISH UP I WANT TO COME BACK
TO THIS


646
0:50:34,7 --> 0:50:38,22
QUESTION OF TIME. HOW CAN WE ESTIMATE THE
TIMING OF


647
0:50:38,22 --> 0:50:41,94
MAJOR EVENTS IN EVOLUTION? AS I HAVE SAID,
WE CAN DO


648
0:50:41,94 --> 0:50:45,77
IT FROM THE FOSSIL RECORD IF WE CAN FIND THE


649
0:50:45,77 --> 0:50:48,18
TRANSITION INTERMEDIATE FORM AND COMMON ANCESTORS
BACK


650
0:50:48,18 --> 0:50:51,77
IN THE RECORD AND DATE THAT PERIOD IN THE
ROCKS IN THE


651
0:50:51,77 --> 0:50:57,23
ROCK RECORD AND WE CAN GET A DIRECT ESTIMATE
OF THE


652
0:50:57,23 --> 0:51:0,69
COMMON ANCESTOR, WHEN WAS THAT COMMON ANCESTOR


653
0:51:0,69 --> 0:51:4,59
PRESENT? WE WILL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT LATER.
THE


654
0:51:4,59 --> 0:51:15,61
OTHER APPROACH IS SO-CALLED MOLECULAR CLOCK.
WHICH IS


655
0:51:15,61 --> 0:51:19,31
THE IDEA THAT THESE MUTATIONS IN GENES BECOME


656
0:51:19,31 --> 0:51:23,19
ESTABLISHED AND ACCUMULATE IN THE ROUGHLY
TIMED


657
0:51:23,19 --> 0:51:27,77
INDEPENDENT MANNER. IF YOU HAD A FOSSIL RECORD
AND


658
0:51:27,77 --> 0:51:35,91
YOU KNEW THAT THE DIVERSION HISTORIES, THIS
AXIS IS


659
0:51:35,91 --> 0:51:42,25
TIME AND THIS AXIS IS DIVERGENCE, AND THIS
IS HOW


660
0:51:42,25 --> 0:51:47,1
DIFFERENT THE TWO GENES ARE, MOLECULAR CHANGE
IS


661
0:51:47,1 --> 0:51:51,24
ACCUMULATED ROUGHLY, IT IS NOT A PERFECT LINE,
SORT OF


662
0:51:51,24 --> 0:51:58,45
 A LOT OF NOISE AROUND IT, THEY ACCUMULATE
OVER TIME.


663
0:51:58,45 --> 0:52:1,98
SO IF YOU HAVE A TREE WHERE, JUST ABOUT DONE,
IF YOU


664
0:52:1,98 --> 0:52:10,83
HAVE A TREE WHERE THIS IS TIME COMING THIS
WAY, AND


665
0:52:10,83 --> 0:52:13,38
YOU CAN FIX A COUPLE OF POINTS FROM THE FOSSIL
RECORD,


666
0:52:13,38 --> 0:52:18,72
LET'S SAY YOU KNOW, YOU CAN ESTIMATE WHEN
THAT COMMON


667
0:52:18,72 --> 0:52:22,8
ANCESTOR WAS FROM THE FOSSIL RECORD, YOU CAN
CALIBRATE


668
0:52:22,8 --> 0:52:26,7
THIS CLOCK AND ESTIMATE THE SLOPE OF THIS
LINE FROM


669
0:52:26,7 --> 0:52:29,25
SAY, IMAGINE YOU HAVE ANOTHER ONE HERE AND
A FEW


670
0:52:29,25 --> 0:52:32,62
OTHERS, THAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT OF DIVERGENCE
OF THAT


671
0:52:32,62 --> 0:52:36,6
GENE. HOW FAST DO ACCUMULATES CHANGE. THEN
YOU CAN


672
0:52:36,6 --> 0:52:41,6
LOOK AT MOLECULAR TREE AND ESTIMATE TIME FOR
THESE


673
0:52:41,6 --> 0:52:45,96
OTHER BRANCHES BASES ON YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF
THESE. IF


674
0:52:45,96 --> 0:52:49,81
MOLECULAR EVOLUTION IS APPROXIMATELY CLOCK-LIKE
AND


675
0:52:49,81 --> 0:52:53,94
ROUGHLY FOLLOWS THIS RULE, AND THIS WAS DEVELOPED
BY


676
0:52:53,94 --> 0:52:57,92
ZUCKERKANDLE WHO WAS A PROFESSOR HERE AND
NOW IS THE


677
0:52:57,92 --> 0:53:1,42
BASIS FOR A LOT OF TIMING OF EVOLUTIONARY
EVENTS. WE


678
0:53:1,42 --> 0:53:5,69
WILL LEAVE IT THERE HAVE A NICE WEEKEND STAY
DRY, SEE


679
0:53:5,69 --> 0:55:5,69
YOU MONDAY.
