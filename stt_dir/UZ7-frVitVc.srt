0:1:14,9 --> 0:1:17,26
I've never been picked
up by black people.

0:1:29,162 --> 0:1:30,68
Your dad's black and Chinese.

BRIAN: Who knows what
their souls are?


126
0:4:27,562 --> 0:4:30,96
DAVID: I heard vampires that
don't want to kill people just


127
0:4:30,96 --> 0:4:32,988
eat pussy of girls that

128
0:4:32,988 --> 0:4:35,73
BRIAN: They don't suck dick?


129
0:4:35,73 --> 0:4:38,145
It's not against the

me you're going to


131
0:4:39,62 --> 0:4:41,944

0:4:51,46 --> 0:4:52,831
Show them your teeth.

0:5:13,1 --> 0:5:14,4
DAVID: Why are you trying
to get Portland?


150
0:5:14,4 --> 0:5:15,41
What's in Portland

That's what happened

175
0:6:4,9 --> 0:6:6,75
MALE SPEAKER: Reno's scary.


176
0:6:6,75 --> 0:6:8,8
DAVID: Are you guys in

177
0:6:8,8 --> 0:6:9,1
RIZZY: I play.


178
0:6:9,1 --> 0:6:10,405

0:6:10,405 --> 0:6:12,6
RIZZY: Ukulele.


180

187
0:6:29,69 --> 0:6:33,695
I just turned 14.


188
0:6:33,695 --> 0:6:36,8
Might as well be drinking
gasoline.


189
0:6:36,8 --> 0:6:43,7
'Cause it's Venice, Malibu,
sand on the beaches just


190
0:6:43,7 --> 0:6:46,12
turning to glue.


191
0:6:46,12 --> 0:6:49,76
Came out with a brand
new drug.


192
0:6:49,76 --> 0:6:52,992
I decided to pull the plug.


193
0:6:52,992 --> 0:7:0,76
And they said, oh, look
what you've done.


194
0:7:0,76 --> 0:7:6,17
They said, oh, look
what you've done.


195
0:7:6,17 --> 0:7:8,876



196
0:7:8,876 --> 0:7:13,212

Well, you've gone and made
a fool of everyone.


199
0:7:22,77 --> 0:7:25,2
This is the most
important part.


200
0:7:25,2 --> 0:7:29,68
And I don't have to
prove to anyone.


201
0:7:29,68 --> 0:7:33,638



202
0:7:33,638 --> 0:7:38,568
Because I've gone and made
a fool of everyone.

Welcome, America, day

0:8:4,41 --> 0:8:8,18
And we were in the biggest
little city in the world.


210
0:8:8,18 --> 0:8:10,41
We sort of had culture
shock last night.


211
0:8:10,41 --> 0:8:12,1
We got out of California.


212
0:8:12,1 --> 0:8:16,34
And I ran into a vampire
that offered to


213
0:8:16,34 --> 0:8:17,64
suck my dick for $100.


214
0:8:17,64 --> 0:8:20,1
And then after we turned
the camera off, said


215
0:8:20,1 --> 0:8:21,73
he'd do it for $20.


216
0:8:21,73 --> 0:8:24,87
And then we had the gutter
punks from Oakland that


217
0:8:24,87 --> 0:8:28,927
somehow came to Reno cracked
out, drunk, straight out of


218
0:8:28,927 --> 0:8:31,724
jail, six or seven of them
trying to figure out how to


219
0:8:31,724 --> 0:8:32,294
get a ride out.


220
0:8:32,294 --> 0:8:34,17
Its sort of sad.


221
0:8:34,17 --> 0:8:38,52
But the girl, Rizzy, played a
song for us that was, like,


222
0:8:38,52 --> 0:8:39,968
pretty awesome.


223
0:8:39,968 --> 0:8:42,755
And I know what you're
thinking.


224
0:8:42,755 --> 0:8:44,72
You think I'm a fucking
cheater.


225
0:8:44,72 --> 0:8:46,46
But think back to [INAUDIBLE],


226
0:8:46,46 --> 0:8:48,79
Mississippi, Las Vegas, Nevada.


227
0:8:48,79 --> 0:8:49,8
You now me, America.


228
0:8:49,8 --> 0:8:51,65
You know I'm a fucking
degenerate gambler.


229
0:8:51,65 --> 0:8:53,42
You know what fucking
type-- oh, shit.


230
0:8:53,42 --> 0:8:56,46
Daniel, you got shit
on your camera.


231
0:8:56,46 --> 0:8:57,96
Let me wipe it off for you.


232
0:8:57,96 --> 0:8:59,44
Let it rain, bitch.


233
0:8:59,44 --> 0:9:2,47
Let it rain, motherfucker.


234
0:9:2,47 --> 0:9:4,43
Fuck yeah, bitch.


235
0:9:4,43 --> 0:9:7,49
This is literally the fucking
shittiest city in the world.


236
0:9:7,49 --> 0:9:10,7
Everyone knows professional
gamblers don't play for comps.


237
0:9:10,7 --> 0:9:14,68
But you play anything more than
a $5 hand in this fucking


238
0:9:14,68 --> 0:9:18,84
shit hole and the rooms are
free, the back rubs are free,


239
0:9:18,84 --> 0:9:20,63
the happy endings are
free, the shitty


240
0:9:20,63 --> 0:9:22,75
fucking buffet's free.


241
0:9:22,75 --> 0:9:23,875
Like I said, we accept
all rides.


242
0:9:23,875 --> 0:9:26,32
We're just not going to
pay for any of them.


243
0:9:26,32 --> 0:9:27,508
So what can I say?


244
0:9:27,508 --> 0:9:38,35



245
0:9:38,35 --> 0:9:40,55
We're just on the outskirts
of Reno.


246
0:9:40,55 --> 0:9:41,3
My lips are chapped.


247
0:9:41,3 --> 0:9:43,185
It's fucking dry.


248
0:9:43,185 --> 0:9:47,16
And there's probably one car
going by every five minutes.


249
0:9:47,16 --> 0:9:50,81
And we found this beautiful
Christmas tree, Shoemas tree.


250
0:9:50,81 --> 0:9:52,19
And I don't know.


251
0:9:52,19 --> 0:9:53,943
I don't know what the
story is behind it.


252
0:9:53,943 --> 0:9:59,16
But Harry took a shit
right behind it.


253
0:9:59,16 --> 0:10:4,96
And then Harry thought it would
be a good idea to punch


254
0:10:4,96 --> 0:10:8,35
his dick and balls between his
legs and put on a wig.


255
0:10:8,35 --> 0:10:9,6
We'll see how that turns out.


256
0:10:9,6 --> 0:10:14,64



257
0:10:14,64 --> 0:10:16,34
They looked like they were
going to slow down.


258
0:10:16,34 --> 0:10:29,7



259
0:10:29,7 --> 0:10:30,0
DAVID: Uh-oh.


260
0:10:30,0 --> 0:10:31,57
Hi, sir.


261
0:10:31,57 --> 0:10:33,11
Can we sit in the back?


262
0:10:33,11 --> 0:10:34,38
DON: No, that's illegal.


263
0:10:34,38 --> 0:10:35,434
DAVID: Oh, really?


264
0:10:35,434 --> 0:10:37,68
DON: In California.


265
0:10:37,68 --> 0:10:38,62
Where are you guys going?


266
0:10:38,62 --> 0:10:40,75
DAVID: As far as
you'll take us.


267
0:10:40,75 --> 0:10:41,74
How far are you going?


268
0:10:41,74 --> 0:10:43,2
DON: About 30, 40 miles.


269
0:10:43,2 --> 0:10:44,83
DAVID: OK, perfect.


270
0:10:44,83 --> 0:10:46,63
Thanks for picking us up, sir.


271
0:10:46,63 --> 0:10:48,31
Because it's getting
hot outside.


272
0:10:48,31 --> 0:10:50,286
DON: Where are you
guys coming from?


273
0:10:50,286 --> 0:10:53,87
DAVID: We started in Tijuana.


274
0:10:53,87 --> 0:10:56,958
And we're going all
the way to Alaska.


275
0:10:56,958 --> 0:10:57,906
Yeah.


276
0:10:57,906 --> 0:11:0,75
You ever been up
towards Alaska?


277
0:11:0,75 --> 0:11:2,646
DON: I've never been
into Canada.


278
0:11:2,646 --> 0:11:4,885
DAVID: Oh, really?


279
0:11:4,885 --> 0:11:6,386
You hate Canadians.


280
0:11:6,386 --> 0:11:6,82
DON: Nope.


281
0:11:6,82 --> 0:11:7,72
DAVID: I do.


282
0:11:7,72 --> 0:11:8,217
DON: Canada?


283
0:11:8,217 --> 0:11:8,714
DAVID: Yeah.


284
0:11:8,714 --> 0:11:10,702
They're the worst people
in the world.


285
0:11:10,702 --> 0:11:14,678
They're so nice, it
makes me angry.


286
0:11:14,678 --> 0:11:17,66



287
0:11:17,66 --> 0:11:22,133
DON: I think I've only known
one my whole life.


288
0:11:22,133 --> 0:11:23,624
And I dated her.


289
0:11:23,624 --> 0:11:25,115
DAVID: Oh, really?


290
0:11:25,115 --> 0:11:26,606
You dated a Canadian?


291
0:11:26,606 --> 0:11:27,6
Did she talk funny?


292
0:11:27,6 --> 0:11:28,594
DON: Yeah, she did.


293
0:11:28,594 --> 0:11:34,61
[LAUGHTER]


294
0:11:34,61 --> 0:11:36,43
DAVID: That was just
like a nice guy.


295
0:11:36,43 --> 0:11:48,74



296
0:11:48,74 --> 0:11:50,1
Rock on, America.


297
0:11:50,1 --> 0:11:52,445
We're in America's wasteland.


298
0:11:52,445 --> 0:11:54,65
We're in a fucking landfill
right now.


299
0:11:54,65 --> 0:11:56,32
Harry's fucking rocking out.


300
0:11:56,32 --> 0:11:57,82
We got a band of refrigerators,


301
0:11:57,82 --> 0:12:0,15
tires, rims, old bikes.


302
0:12:0,15 --> 0:12:5,444
It's got everything we need
for our music video.


303
0:12:5,444 --> 0:12:6,436
[SHOUTS]


304
0:12:6,436 --> 0:12:13,876
[MUSIC PLAYING]


305
0:12:13,876 --> 0:12:17,348
DAVID: Fuck yeah, bitch!


306
0:12:17,348 --> 0:12:19,828
[SHOUTS]


307
0:12:19,828 --> 0:12:42,85
[MUSIC PLAYING]


308
0:12:42,85 --> 0:12:44,65
DAVID: [SHOUTS]


309
0:12:44,65 --> 0:12:45,538
[SIGHS]


310
0:12:45,538 --> 0:12:47,29
Fuck, man.


311
0:12:47,29 --> 0:12:49,54
Life on the road
feels so good.


312
0:12:49,54 --> 0:12:52,26
And it feels so good to jam with
your friends and fucking


313
0:12:52,26 --> 0:12:54,8
break shit.


314
0:12:54,8 --> 0:12:56,8
I just took 10 years
off my life, man.


315
0:12:56,8 --> 0:13:1,8
I'm 16 again.


316
0:13:1,8 --> 0:13:3,12
So we're somewhere in
northern California.


317
0:13:3,12 --> 0:13:6,48
There's lots of trees,
maybe some bears.


318
0:13:6,48 --> 0:13:8,96
Maybe some gay bears,
I don't know.


319
0:13:8,96 --> 0:13:12,68
We were out by the shoe tree for
quite a while until Harry


320
0:13:12,68 --> 0:13:15,11
punched his dick and
balls past his legs


321
0:13:15,11 --> 0:13:15,9
and put on a wig.


322
0:13:15,9 --> 0:13:18,58
And then we got a ride
immediately.


323
0:13:18,58 --> 0:13:22,11
There is probably one car going
by right now every five


324
0:13:22,11 --> 0:13:26,9
minutes, maybe one
every 10 minutes.


325
0:13:26,9 --> 0:13:28,5
Getting pretty hungry.


326
0:13:28,5 --> 0:13:28,85
Sun's going to go down.


327
0:13:28,85 --> 0:13:31,13
It's going to be really scary
once the sun's down.


328
0:13:31,13 --> 0:13:33,32
It'll be pitch black out here.


329
0:13:33,32 --> 0:13:35,63
But cash is king.


330
0:13:35,63 --> 0:13:36,98
Cash is cool.


331
0:13:36,98 --> 0:13:37,98
Winning money is great.


332
0:13:37,98 --> 0:13:39,85
But today I won twice.


333
0:13:39,85 --> 0:13:41,1
I won twice.


334
0:13:41,1 --> 0:13:44,405



335
0:13:44,405 --> 0:13:46,7
I brought some napkins
into the buffet


336
0:13:46,7 --> 0:13:47,41
like any good Asian.


337
0:13:47,41 --> 0:13:51,16
And Daniel, would you
like a cannoli?


338
0:13:51,16 --> 0:13:52,154
DANIEL: I'd love a cannoli.


339
0:13:52,154 --> 0:13:53,15
DAVID: Here you go.


340
0:13:53,15 --> 0:13:56,198
Harry, would you like
a macaroon?


341
0:13:56,198 --> 0:13:56,666
HARRY: Oh, yes.


342
0:13:56,666 --> 0:13:58,54
A macaroon would be tasty.


343
0:13:58,54 --> 0:13:59,6
DANIEL: It's good.


344
0:13:59,6 --> 0:13:59,79
HARRY: Thank you.


345
0:13:59,79 --> 0:14:1,46
DAVID: Thumbs up, America.


346
0:14:1,46 --> 0:14:2,47
I won twice today.


347
0:14:2,47 --> 0:14:3,99
And we're about to get
a ride right now.


348
0:14:3,99 --> 0:14:11,79



349
0:14:11,79 --> 0:14:13,71
We need a sign.


350
0:14:13,71 --> 0:14:15,161
We're trying to get to Oregon.


351
0:14:15,161 --> 0:14:17,47
HARRY: Portland.


352
0:14:17,47 --> 0:14:19,23
DAVID: How do you
spell Portland?


353
0:14:19,23 --> 0:14:22,674
HARRY: P-O-R-T-L-A-N-D.


354
0:14:22,674 --> 0:14:24,65
DAVID: This is better.


355
0:14:24,65 --> 0:14:26,18
It's unisex.


356
0:14:26,18 --> 0:14:28,425
We toss salads.


357
0:14:28,425 --> 0:14:29,79
People have to got to
be able to read it.


358
0:14:29,79 --> 0:14:51,526



359
0:14:51,526 --> 0:14:57,18
As the sun goes down over day
four, we go dangerously close


360
0:14:57,18 --> 0:14:58,39
to the Oregon border.


361
0:14:58,39 --> 0:14:59,505
We're getting out
of California.


362
0:14:59,505 --> 0:15:1,575
We're getting out of Nevada.


363
0:15:1,575 --> 0:15:5,99
Who knows what awaits
us in the Northwest?


364
0:15:5,99 --> 0:15:6,96
We'll see.


365
0:15:6,96 --> 0:15:8,5
Freaks come out at night.


366
0:15:8,5 --> 0:15:9,792
It'll be dark soon.


367
0:15:9,792 --> 0:15:18,743



368
0:15:18,743 --> 0:15:21,238
Come on, give us a ride.


369
0:15:21,238 --> 0:15:28,9



370
0:15:28,9 --> 0:15:30,64
So ladies and gentlemen, you
should definitely not


371
0:15:30,64 --> 0:15:31,345
hitchhike at night.


372
0:15:31,345 --> 0:15:33,555
We're having a tough time
getting a ride.


373
0:15:33,555 --> 0:15:34,89
It's not really the best time.


374
0:15:34,89 --> 0:15:36,892
People can't really
see your faces.


375
0:15:36,892 --> 0:15:39,825
So we've been stuck at this
off-ramp for a little bit.


376
0:15:39,825 --> 0:15:43,368
I don't know why Harry's
so sexed up.


377
0:15:43,368 --> 0:15:45,68
Did you just shoplift a dildo?


378
0:15:45,68 --> 0:15:46,52
HARRY: We need it.


379
0:15:46,52 --> 0:15:47,77
DAVID: Wait, is that?


380
0:15:47,77 --> 0:15:50,582



381
0:15:50,582 --> 0:15:56,65
He just shoplifted a hard
orange penis telephone.


382
0:15:56,65 --> 0:15:57,9
Here's redial.


383
0:15:57,9 --> 0:15:59,7



384
0:15:59,7 --> 0:16:0,95
Why did you steal this?


385
0:16:0,95 --> 0:16:5,88



386
0:16:5,88 --> 0:16:8,15
This guy might be the
biggest genius on


387
0:16:8,15 --> 0:16:9,32
the face of the planet.


388
0:16:9,32 --> 0:16:13,99
He just created thumbs
up, America.


389
0:16:13,99 --> 0:16:14,757
Thumbs up.


390
0:16:14,757 --> 0:16:17,92
[CHUCKLES]


391
0:16:17,92 --> 0:16:18,96
It's a fucking huge thumb.


392
0:16:18,96 --> 0:16:20,361
[LAUGHTER]


393
0:16:20,361 --> 0:16:24,1
DAVID: Let's give it a try.


394
0:16:24,1 --> 0:16:25,16
It can't hurt.


395
0:16:25,16 --> 0:16:26,41
We've tried everything else.


396
0:16:26,41 --> 0:16:30,418



397
0:16:30,418 --> 0:16:31,86
KEYLA: Do you guys
need a ride?


398
0:16:31,86 --> 0:16:32,43
DAVID: Yes.


399
0:16:32,43 --> 0:16:33,13
KEYLA: All right.


400
0:16:33,13 --> 0:16:34,165
DAVID: Is your car OK?


401
0:16:34,165 --> 0:16:35,14
KEYLA: Where you heading to?


402
0:16:35,14 --> 0:16:36,39
DAVID: As far as
you'll take us.


403
0:16:36,39 --> 0:16:37,31
KEYLA: All right, sweet.


404
0:16:37,31 --> 0:16:39,94
Well, we kind of hit a deer.


405
0:16:39,94 --> 0:16:41,5
DAVID: You guys hit a deer?


406
0:16:41,5 --> 0:16:43,12
Oh my god.


407
0:16:43,12 --> 0:16:44,5
Are you guys OK?


408
0:16:44,5 --> 0:16:45,28
KEYLA: We're all right.


409
0:16:45,28 --> 0:16:46,62
DAVID: Is the car OK?


410
0:16:46,62 --> 0:16:47,69
KEYLA: It's OK so far.


411
0:16:47,69 --> 0:16:49,1
DAVID: Is the deer OK?


412
0:16:49,1 --> 0:16:49,74
KEYLA: No.


413
0:16:49,74 --> 0:16:50,91
DAVID: The deer is dead, huh?


414
0:16:50,91 --> 0:16:53,54
KEYLA: Intestines all
over the road.


415
0:16:53,54 --> 0:16:54,922
All right, well hop in.


416
0:16:54,922 --> 0:16:56,805
HARRY: Thanks for the ride.


417
0:16:56,805 --> 0:16:57,3
DYLAN: Yeah, no problem.


418
0:16:57,3 --> 0:16:58,785
KEYLA: Yeah, no problem.


419
0:16:58,785 --> 0:17:1,89
DAVID: You guys seem
surprisingly unphased by the


420
0:17:1,89 --> 0:17:5,65
fact that half of your
car is smashed in.


421
0:17:5,65 --> 0:17:6,309
KEYLA: It's my car.


422
0:17:6,309 --> 0:17:8,61
And I really cannot do
anything about it.


423
0:17:8,61 --> 0:17:12,42



424
0:17:12,42 --> 0:17:14,143
DAVID: Hey, I'm down for
the adventure, too.


425
0:17:14,143 --> 0:17:22,32



426
0:17:22,32 --> 0:17:23,57
DAVID: Oh my god.


427
0:17:23,57 --> 0:17:28,313



428
0:17:28,313 --> 0:17:28,811
DAVID: Oh, really?


429
0:17:28,811 --> 0:17:30,61
KEYLA: Yep.


430
0:17:30,61 --> 0:17:37,81



431
0:17:37,81 --> 0:17:39,224
DAVID: You guys are BFF.


432
0:17:39,224 --> 0:17:42,6
KEYLA: Yep, BFFs.


433
0:17:42,6 --> 0:17:44,67
DAVID: I've never had a
friend that's a girl.


434
0:17:44,67 --> 0:17:48,87
I mean, I did up until
I was, like, 21.


435
0:17:48,87 --> 0:17:50,3
KEYLA: Yeah, that's what
we were talking about.


436
0:17:50,3 --> 0:17:51,45
DAVID: How old are you guys?


437
0:17:51,45 --> 0:17:52,45
KEYLA: I'm 19.


438
0:17:52,45 --> 0:17:52,95
DYLAN: I'm 18.


439
0:17:52,95 --> 0:17:55,45
DAVID: Oh shit.


440
0:17:55,45 --> 0:17:56,33
All right.


441
0:17:56,33 --> 0:17:57,185
KEYLA: Oh shit?


442
0:17:57,185 --> 0:17:57,66
What?


443
0:17:57,66 --> 0:17:58,91
DAVID: I'm just really
bitter and jaded.


444
0:17:58,91 --> 0:18:1,56



445
0:18:1,56 --> 0:18:2,1
KEYLA: OK.


446
0:18:2,1 --> 0:18:7,468
DAVID: I always end up having
sex with a girl that's


447
0:18:7,468 --> 0:18:9,903
supposed to be my friend,
or whatever.


448
0:18:9,903 --> 0:18:11,364
So then I always--


449
0:18:11,364 --> 0:18:12,338
KEYLA: Ew!


450
0:18:12,338 --> 0:18:13,799
Cooties.


451
0:18:13,799 --> 0:18:15,98
DAVID: Oh, you guys
love each other.


452
0:18:15,98 --> 0:18:17,2
You guys are meant
for each other.


453
0:18:17,2 --> 0:18:18,568
KEYLA: We do love each other.


454
0:18:18,568 --> 0:18:21,304
DAVID: Why do you want
to fight it?


455
0:18:21,304 --> 0:18:23,15
KEYLA: You and me
were in a fight.


456
0:18:23,15 --> 0:18:24,5
DAVID: I mean, you guys
are fucking kids.


457
0:18:24,5 --> 0:18:27,55
Do you even understand how hard
it is to find someone to


458
0:18:27,55 --> 0:18:28,8
travel with?


459
0:18:28,8 --> 0:18:31,3
KEYLA: We're chilling
because we're not


460
0:18:31,3 --> 0:18:31,67
together, or whatever.


461
0:18:31,67 --> 0:18:34,17
But if we were going out--


462
0:18:34,17 --> 0:18:36,17
DYLAN: That would be a
whole other story.


463
0:18:36,17 --> 0:18:37,61
DAVID: Did you not see
that this was a big


464
0:18:37,61 --> 0:18:39,387
penis on the fist?


465
0:18:39,387 --> 0:18:40,839
KEYLA: I didn't really
notice it right away.


466
0:18:40,839 --> 0:18:42,57
I'm not gonna lie.


467
0:18:42,57 --> 0:18:44,23
DAVID: You noticed it right
away and pulled over?


468
0:18:44,23 --> 0:18:44,985
DYLAN: Oh, yeah.


469
0:18:44,985 --> 0:18:46,19
DAVID: Awesome.


470
0:18:46,19 --> 0:18:47,66
You should definitely
marry this guy.


471
0:18:47,66 --> 0:18:48,21
He's adventurous.


472
0:18:48,21 --> 0:18:49,815
KEYLA: Ew.


473
0:18:49,815 --> 0:18:52,705
DAVID: Well, America, nothing
more refreshing than being out


474
0:18:52,705 --> 0:18:56,29
on the road and being picked
up by young lovers in love.


475
0:18:56,29 --> 0:18:59,22
They don't even know it.


476
0:18:59,22 --> 0:19:0,87
KEYLA: Maybe.


477
0:19:0,87 --> 0:19:2,12
DAVID: Thumbs up, America.


478
0:19:2,12 --> 0:19:12,289



479
0:19:12,289 --> 0:19:13,539
HARRY: Jump!


480
0:19:13,539 --> 0:19:25,3



481
0:19:25,3 --> 0:19:27,6
DAVID: Thumbs up, America.


482
0:19:27,6 --> 0:19:29,85
We have to cool Harry off.


483
0:19:29,85 --> 0:19:31,13
He was sexed up too much.


484
0:19:31,13 --> 0:19:33,645



485
0:19:33,645 --> 0:19:37,28
I've got to change his name
back to Horny Kim.


486
0:19:37,28 --> 0:19:39,53
There's too much sexual
tension in the air.


487
0:19:39,53 --> 0:19:42,32
And that ride last
night, whew.


488
0:19:42,32 --> 0:19:43,595
You could cut it with a knife.


489
0:19:43,595 --> 0:19:46,17
It was so thick, like
Harry's foreskin.


490
0:19:46,17 --> 0:20:22,4



491
0:20:22,4 --> 0:20:23,35
What's up?


492
0:20:23,35 --> 0:20:24,784
What's up?


493
0:20:24,784 --> 0:20:26,263
What city are we in?


494
0:20:26,263 --> 0:20:27,0
JOE: [INAUDIBLE].


495
0:20:27,0 --> 0:20:27,48
DAVID: What?


496
0:20:27,48 --> 0:20:28,92
JOE: Oh, what city
are you guys in?


497
0:20:28,92 --> 0:20:29,88
DAVID: Yeah, where is this?


498
0:20:29,88 --> 0:20:30,36
JOE: Florence.


499
0:20:30,36 --> 0:20:30,73
DAVID: Florence?


500
0:20:30,73 --> 0:20:31,197
JOE: Florence.


501
0:20:31,197 --> 0:20:32,598
What's up, guys?


502
0:20:32,598 --> 0:20:33,532
DAVID: Dave, man.


503
0:20:33,532 --> 0:20:34,466
Nice to meet you.


504
0:20:34,466 --> 0:20:34,933
JOE: Nice to meet you, too.


505
0:20:34,933 --> 0:20:35,4
DAVID: What's your name?


506
0:20:35,4 --> 0:20:36,155
JOE: Joe.


507
0:20:36,155 --> 0:20:36,79
DAVID: Joe, what's up, man?


508
0:20:36,79 --> 0:20:37,32
This is Harry.


509
0:20:37,32 --> 0:20:38,736
JOE: Harry, right
on, brother man.


510
0:20:38,736 --> 0:20:40,14
You're more like my
family, brother.


511
0:20:40,14 --> 0:20:42,23
Me and you got a lot
[INAUDIBLE].


512
0:20:42,23 --> 0:20:42,95
DAVID: What's up, man?


513
0:20:42,95 --> 0:20:44,682
JOE: You guys should
jump over.


514
0:20:44,682 --> 0:20:45,81
DAVID: Hey, let's jump over.


515
0:20:45,81 --> 0:20:48,69
HARRY: All right.


516
0:20:48,69 --> 0:20:49,782
JOE: Come on over.


517
0:20:49,782 --> 0:20:54,16
God damn it, don't break down
the damn fence, though.


518
0:20:54,16 --> 0:20:55,41
DAVID: What's up, man?


519
0:20:55,41 --> 0:21:12,535



520
0:21:12,535 --> 0:21:14,26
DAVID: Wait, you guys don't know
each other and you guys


521
0:21:14,26 --> 0:21:15,79
met each other traveling
and now you're


522
0:21:15,79 --> 0:21:16,65
like the three amigos?


523
0:21:16,65 --> 0:21:19,34
JOE: Well, this guy, he
started four days ago.


524
0:21:19,34 --> 0:21:20,74
He owned his own business.


525
0:21:20,74 --> 0:21:21,95
He had everything going.


526
0:21:21,95 --> 0:21:23,16
He had a house and everything.


527
0:21:23,16 --> 0:21:24,41
His wife kicked him out.


528
0:21:24,41 --> 0:21:40,68



529
0:21:40,68 --> 0:21:42,95

you want to tell us, like


530
0:21:42,95 --> 0:21:44,9
stories from the road?


531
0:21:44,9 --> 0:21:46,58

what do you want?

0:21:46,58 --> 0:21:47,3
FREDDY: Quiet.


533
0:21:47,3 --> 0:21:48,23
I need quiet.

about an eight.


538
0:22:0,264 --> 0:22:4,7

this story one time.


545
0:22:23,43 --> 0:22:25,0
I was in seventh grade.


546
0:22:25,0 --> 0:22:26,29
DAVID: You were in
seventh grade?


547
0:22:26,29 --> 0:22:28,406
RICK: Seventh grade.


548
0:22:28,406 --> 0:22:29,894
I burned down the school.

down the school!


550
0:22:31,88 --> 0:22:32,922
Shit!

DAVID: Man, I thought I
didn't like school.


554
0:22:36,69 --> 0:22:38,19
I thought I didn't like it.


555
0:22:38,19 --> 0:22:39,6
Come on, Rick, give it up.


556
0:22:39,6 --> 0:22:40,5
Fuck school, man.


557
0:22:40,5 --> 0:22:42,5
I fucking hate school, too.


558
0:22:42,5 --> 0:22:43,78
I dropped out of school.


559
0:22:43,78 --> 0:22:44,99
But I didn't burn it down.


560
0:22:44,99 --> 0:22:46,63
RICK: No, I went
back to school.


561
0:22:46,63 --> 0:22:48,48
I got me a college education.


562
0:22:48,48 --> 0:22:50,202

school after you did that?


563

JOE: I'm a poor white man.


570
0:23:16,74 --> 0:23:19,752
Pussy doesn't come unless, very
rare in my book, man.


571
0:23:19,752 --> 0:23:24,72

don't get pussy, take this.

DAVID: So then you need
to make a road pussy.


577
0:23:32,26 --> 0:23:35,73
You pack this sleeping
bag up really tight.


578
0:23:35,73 --> 0:23:37,105
You dig a fucking hole.

0:23:37,105 --> 0:23:38,32

633
0:25:13,82 --> 0:25:16,555
FREDDY: Do you know why we
like Alaska so well?


634
0:25:16,555 --> 0:25:16,85
DAVID: Why?


635
0:25:16,85 --> 0:25:20,3
FREDDY: Because certain parts
of the year, there's only 10


636

0:25:26,94 --> 0:25:28,665
DAVID: The vampires are there
because it's fucking


643
0:25:28,665 --> 0:25:29,96

Buffy chick, you tell her I

Kennedy's inauguration speech.


657
0:26:0,7 --> 0:26:3,5
But she said, we didn't
have much.
