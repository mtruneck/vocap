Word up Food Tubers, Mister Oliver here.
We have an incredible dish today. We're doing


2
0:0:8,7 --> 0:0:15,9
a beautiful, beautiful cured salmon with amazing
marinated crushed beetroots, horseradish cream.


3
0:0:15,9 --> 0:0:18,76
This is the dish you want to cook for the
girlfriend, the boyfriend, get the mother


4
0:0:18,76 --> 0:0:20,789
in law round. It's going to be super, super
good.


5
0:0:20,789 --> 0:0:25,82
We've got some beautiful fresh salmon, that's
300 grams there. That's going to serve four


6
0:0:25,82 --> 0:0:30,759
people.
Three heaped tablespoons of Malden sea salt


7
0:0:30,759 --> 0:0:35,9
goes in there. Most of that is going to come
away but we need that salt to penetrate that


8
0:0:35,9 --> 0:0:38,899
fish to cure it.
It gives you this sort of incredible waxy,


9
0:0:38,899 --> 0:0:43,399
delicate texture that allows you to slice
it really thinly, easily and it looks and


10
0:0:43,399 --> 0:0:46,489
tastes amazing.
So we want to add more flavour in there, brown


11
0:0:46,489 --> 0:0:54,48
sugar one heaped tablespoon like that. Lemon
zest, orange, half of the zest. Then we're


12
0:0:54,48 --> 0:0:59,3
going to use dill.
That, for later, but this part here, the stalks


13
0:0:59,3 --> 0:1:6,43
really sweet. Slice it up and that's all going
to fall off so that's flavour for free, nothing


14
0:1:6,43 --> 0:1:12,6
in the bin. And then the secret ingredient.
Some decent vodka. One shot.


15
0:1:12,6 --> 0:1:16,2
This is not traditional, right but it adds
to the whole kind of flavour that we're after


16
0:1:16,2 --> 0:1:20,259
here.
Massage up that lemon, vodka, sugar. What


17
0:1:20,259 --> 0:1:27,54
I want to do is pack that salt onto this salmon
and put the other salmon on top.


18
0:1:27,54 --> 0:1:33,2
Get a bit of cling film and we're simply going
to wrap it up super tight.


19
0:1:33,2 --> 0:1:37,49
Put that in the fridge, I do it in the morning
by 12, 1 o'clock in the afternoon it's ready


20
0:1:37,49 --> 0:1:40,82
and raring to go. If you leave it a little
bit longer it will get firmer and firmer and


21
0:1:40,82 --> 0:1:45,67
firmer. Nine hours is fine, but five hours
is optimal.


22
0:1:45,67 --> 0:1:49,899
This is what it looks like after 5 hours.
It's firmed up nicely. I'm actually just going


23
0:1:49,899 --> 0:1:55,1
to brush this salt off, normally in a gravadlax
recipe you would to wash it off. You don't


24
0:1:55,1 --> 0:1:58,219
need to do that.
We're going to use our dill. What I want to


25
0:1:58,219 --> 0:2:5,369
do is kind of create a little herby bark on
the outside. Just finely chop it.


26
0:2:5,369 --> 0:2:12,24
Right, and then the fish goes straight into
that. See how it just coats it beautifully?


27
0:2:12,24 --> 0:2:15,8
Absolutely gorgeous. This goes into the fridge
until you need it.


28
0:2:15,8 --> 0:2:20,25
What I'm going to do now is show you how to
make the beautiful horseradish sour cream


29
0:2:20,25 --> 0:2:26,86
and beautiful crushed marinated beetroots.
So, so simple. Roughly, for four people. Two


30
0:2:26,86 --> 0:2:30,5
heaped tablespoons of soured cream, about
two heaped teaspoons of horseradish, it's


31
0:2:30,5 --> 0:2:35,5
got to have attitude or otherwise why bother?
Then half a lemon, do you remember the one


32
0:2:35,5 --> 0:2:40,41
I grated? Squeeze it, catch the seeds. A nice
little pinch of salt. A little bit of quality


33
0:2:40,41 --> 0:2:43,89
extra virgin olive oil in there. One tablespoon.
Mix it up.


34
0:2:43,89 --> 0:2:52,62
All you really need to do is taste it for
seasoning and heat. Nice and hot makes your


35
0:2:52,62 --> 0:2:56,17
nose go a little whoo hoo!
Next, beetroots, add a little bit of balsamic


36
0:2:56,17 --> 0:3:7,15
vinegar, nice pinch of salt, a little oil.
I quite like crushing I like it being rustic.


37
0:3:7,15 --> 0:3:14,31
That is going to be joyful. I'm going to have
a little clean up so you can fast forward!


38
0:3:14,31 --> 0:3:19,84
Okay, so missus is coming round, mother in
law and the old man is coming round. If they


39
0:3:19,84 --> 0:3:23,53
turn up and you're hot and sweaty and look
stressed. Not cool. Even if you're bad with


40
0:3:23,53 --> 0:3:28,7
knife skills you'll manage half or just over
half a centimetre.


41
0:3:28,7 --> 0:3:31,8
It's nice and thin. It's almost you can see
the light through it.


42
0:3:31,8 --> 0:3:35,11
You've got the herb there, you know it's fresh
but it's lightly cured.


43
0:3:35,11 --> 0:3:39,42
Towards the end just kind of flare it out
to take the salmon off because you don't want


44
0:3:39,42 --> 0:3:43,63
that skin.
The second way of doing it.


45
0:3:43,63 --> 0:3:50,84
Take the end off, you're simply going to take
your knife along the bottom of the salmon


46
0:3:50,84 --> 0:3:55,51
and that takes all the skin off in one. All
of this you can do in advance. Okay so we've


47
0:3:55,51 --> 0:4:0,22
got that on the plate. Horseradish sour cream.
Just going to do a little pile there.


48
0:4:0,22 --> 0:4:5,1
I love the way the beets just kind of bleed
into the beautiful sour cream. You've got


49
0:4:5,1 --> 0:4:12,52
the salon. It's really, really nice dish.
1980's cress. A nice bit there, fresh dill.


50
0:4:12,52 --> 0:4:17,579
From a height just pick it off. Really nice.
A little olive oil.


51
0:4:17,579 --> 0:4:24,4
Look at that absolutely gorgeous.
If someone gives that to me I am so chuffed!


52
0:4:24,4 --> 0:4:32,0
Really, really good!
So good!


53
0:4:32,0 --> 0:4:36,31
The salmon is lightly cured so it's got that
lovely sort of waxyness that you get from


54
0:4:36,31 --> 0:4:40,32
things like smoked salmon and prosciutto and
stuff like that really nice to eat.


55
0:4:40,32 --> 0:4:44,35
Beetroot's just sweet and gorgeous the heat
of the horseradish. So good!


56
0:4:44,35 --> 0:4:49,6
So to go with this gorgeous dish for this
lovely night out, how about a nice cocktail?


57
