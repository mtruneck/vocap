###3 Oh, hey,
###5 you mind if Kevin hangs out with me on Thursday?
###6 What for?
###8 Well, he'd been wanting
###9 to get into other sports besides soccer.
###11 Maybe the cool Uncle can succeed
###13 where the father has failed.
###15 You're not his Uncle.
###16 That is a minor technicality.
###18 You're not cool.
###20 Okay, now you're just being ridiculous.
###22 What are you guys gonna do?
###24 Oh, I don't know,
###25 maybe shop for purses,
###26 go to a knitting class, water ballet.
###28 What do you think?
###29 We're just gonna hang out,
###30 you know, like guys do.
###32 If it's okay with him, it's okay with me,
###34 as long as you stay out of trouble.
###36 If you're referring to Kevin's birthday party,
###38 the ad said entertainer.
###40 How was I supposed to know
###41 she was that kind of entertainer?
###42 Hey, Martin.
###43 Morning, Suzanne.
###44 You're out of corn flakes.
###47 Hey, baby.
###48 Good morning.
###51 Mom, can I borrow your credit card?
###53 What for?
###55 I want to buy the sweater
###56 that Michelle Obama's going to wear at her next speech.
###58 You can only get it online.
###60 The first time, I took too long.
###61 The second time, I didn't even have enough money.
###64 This time, I'm ready.
###66 But I need a credit card.
###68 No.
###69 Why not?
###71 Because every time I ask you to help me with something,
###74 you give me attitude.
###75 So why should I help you get what you want
###76 when you won't help me?
###78 These dishes have been sitting here since last night.
###80 But I've been busy.
###81 Besides, I didn't dirty all these dishes.
###83 That's exactly the attitude I'm talking about.
###86 But-- but nothing.
###87 I can't hear you.
###89 My plates are screaming, "clean me."
###92 No, they're screaming,
###93 "let Lindsey use the credit card."
###96 My plates aren't stupid.

###115 hello.
###117 Hi.
###118 [Sighs]
###125 [Sighs loudly]
###130 [Sighs]
###132 What's up, Lindsey?
###136 I want to buy the sweater
###137 that Michelle Obama's wearing at her next speech.
###139 Have you saved up your money?
###142 Yeah.
###143 Where do you get it?
###144 At J. Crew.
###145 Well, why don't you just go to the mall and get it?
###148 Anybody can go to J. Crew.
###149 It's not like it's rodeo drive.
###151 They never make it to the store.
###153 Everyone buys them online, and they sell out.
###156 It's easier to get Michelle Obama
###157 than it is to get a Michelle Obama sweater.
###159 Did you forget
###161 that I used to own a sports collectible shop
###162 that specialized in acquiring hard-to-find items?
###165 Kind of.
###167 I am the master of getting hard-to-find items.
###169 I got Kobe Bryant's 8 Jersey,
###171 a Plaxico Burress gun holster.
###174 I even got a pair of Michael Phelps' floaties.
###176 So...
###179 So you're doing it the wrong way.
###181 Let me show you how a professional does it.
###184 Can I use your credit card?
###186 Yeah. That's not a problem.
###188 And because you're family,
###189 I'll offer you my services free of charge.
###192 I wasn't gonna pay you.
###193 That's also why it's free of charge.
###196 So let me get this straight.
###198 A man offered you money
###199 to get him a signed bat A-Rod used in a game,
###202 so you sent letters to a children's foundation
###204 pretending to be an orphan
###205 whose dream was to have a signed A-Rod bat.
###208 Yes.
###209 But now someone from the children's foundation
###211 is coming here to meet that kid,
###212 so you want me to be that fake kid,
###214 lie to them and my dad,
###216 who just thinks we're going to hang out?
###218 Well, when you say it like that,
###219 it sounds negative.
###221 Yeah, it doesn't seem right.
###222 That's 'cause you left out
###223 the good, wholesome part of the story.
###225 That guy is gonna give me 500 bucks for that bat,
###227 and I'll give you $50.
###229 You're right.
###230 That does make it seem better.
###231 It's a deal.
###233 All right, sit down.
###235 Okay, this is everything I could find online
###237 about A-Rod, okay?
###238 I need you to study these stats
###239 in case it comes up in conversation,
###241 talking rbis, slugging percentage,
###243 girlfriend history,
###245 both celebrity and noncelebrity, okay?
###247 And these are letters.
###248 I need you to take a look at these,
###250 because, well, you wrote them.
###252 What's a crack whore?
###254 Unfortunately, your mom.
###261 Mmm.
###263 I smell cinnamon toast.
###266 No, you smell cinnamon.
###268 The toast is gone.
###269 Oh, I'm starved.
###270 I didn't eat dinner last night.
###272 Why didn't you eat dinner?
###274 Because I'm in between boyfriends,
###276 and I didn't have anyone to take me out.
###278 So why don't you just go to the grocery store?
###281 I'm not gonna be without a boyfriend for that long.
###284 Besides, I spend my money on looking good
###286 so other people will buy me food.
###290 But for now,
###291 I'll have to depend on me, myself, and I.
###296 I'm hungry.
###299 What do you have for me to eat?
###300 [Sighs]
###310 Are you gonna watch
###311 Michelle Obama's speech this afternoon?
###313 Yeah, of course. Why?
###314 Well, Lindsey wants whatever J. Crew sweater
###317 she's gonna be wearing, and apparently,
###319 so does every other girl in the country.
###320 Really?
###321 Girls care about J. Crew sweaters?
###323 If Michelle Obama wore it.
###326 But, you know, she wanted to use my credit card,
###328 but I wouldn't let Lindsey,
###329 because she hasn't been helping me around the house.
###331 You know, if those sweaters are that popular,
###334 maybe I can sell one online
###336 and it'll help tide me over while I'm in between boyfriends.
###340 Did you know gas is over $3 a gallon?
###344 Yes.
###345 Anyway, I think you should help Lindsey.
###349 Housework will be here every week.
###351 Michelle Obama sweaters are here for a limited time only.
###355 Toaster waffles, huh?
###357 How do you make these?
###361 Okay.
###362 In what year was A-Rod drafted by the Mariners?
###365 Uh, 1993?
###367 Correct.
###369 When was A-Rod born?
###370 July 27...1975.
###375 Correct.
###376 What's A-Rod's middle name?
###377 Emmanuel.
###378 Correct.
###381 I can't believe you.
###382 What are you talking about?
###385 I was actually thinking about giving you my credit card.
###387 But you just don't get it, Lindsey.
###389 This basket of clothes has been in there all day.
###392 You could have folded them.
###393 You could have put them away.
###395 But no, you left them there to remind me
###397 that you don't do anything to help me around this house.
###400 You know what?
###401 Michelle Obama did not get to be the first lady
###403 by being lazy.
###411 She didn't get there by folding clothes either.
###413 Now you're definitely not getting it.
###420 Bam!
###421 You ready to get this?
###422 Okay, so how does all this stuff work?
###425 We got to see Michelle Obama
###426 the second she walks out onstage,
###428 and I mean the first second,
###429 not the second second.
###430 Look, all these screens are a different shot,
###432 so I got all the angles.
###434 I got East, West, North, South,
###437 northwest, northeast, southwest, southeast, eastwest.
###440 Eastwest?
###441 When I say all the angles,
###442 I mean all the angles.
###443 Look, I've already pulled up the possible websites
###446 where we can buy it,
###447 so as soon as you identify
###448 the color and style of the sweater,
###450 bam!
###451 Oh, my God. There she is.
###453 What's the color?
###455 Pink.
###458 Bam!
###459 What kind of pink?
###460 Fuchsia, salmon, coral?
###462 Salmon.
###464 Bam!
###465 What's the sleeve?
###467 3/4.
###469 Bam!
###470 What's the length?
###471 Short waist.
###473 Button-down?
###475 Bam!
###476 Bam!
###477 What's the size?
###478 I don't know what size she wears.
###480 Not her size, your size.
###482 Small.
###484 Bam!

###487 Both: Bam!

###545 Wow.
###554 Was somebody at the front door?
###556 Why? Were you expecting somebody?
###558 No. Why?
###560 Because you asked. That's why.
###562 Lindsey, I just saw a delivery truck.
###566 Did you get your sweater yet?
###567 What sweater?
###568 This sweater.
###570 Bam!
###571 Give me. Give me. Give me. Give me.

###580 Oh, feel it. Watch this.
###581 Oh, bam!
###582 [Laughs]

###603 You have no idea what's going on, do you?

###610 I told your daughter she couldn't get this sweater
###612 because she hasn't been helping me around the house.
###615 Is this true?
###617 Well...
###620 You used my powers for evil?
###622 I'm sorry, dad.
###624 Why are you apologizing to him?
###626 He just got tricked.
###628 I got disrespected.
###629 But I was-- but, ah.
###630 Here's what's gonna happen, Lindsey.
###633 You are gonna march down to the mall,
###634 and you're gonna return this sweater.
###636 But I was--
###637 are you still talking?
###639 Go upstairs.
###645 I'm sorry, baby.
###646 I didn't know.
###648 It doesn't make any difference.
###650 You shouldn't be making decisions like this without me.
###653 Wait.
###654 How am I supposed to know
###655 what decisions to check with you about?
###657 That's easy.
###658 Before you decide, check with me.
###662 Fine.
###663 From now on, I don't do anything without asking you first.
###672 Oh.
###675 Excuse me. Can I leave?
###678 Actually, it's "may" you, and yes, you may.
###692 [Door clicks open]
###694 Candace, this is the kid I wrote to you--
###696 I mean, the poor child who wrote to you
###699 about his love of A-Rod.
###701 We're in a mentor program together.
###704 It's great to meet you, Kevin.
###706 Give me a pound, yo.
###707 Huh?
###708 She wants you to shake her hand.
###709 Shake? Shake.
###711 Yeah.
###712 [Growls playfully]
###713 So I'm sorry to get you out of bed so early.
###715 I'm sure after holding down a corner all night,
###717 you must be exhausted.
###718 I don't know how you do it on the drug time.
###720 Drug time? What--
###721 actually, Kevin doesn't get much sleep at the group home.
###724 You know how it is with the constant fighting
###726 and the stabbings and whatnot.
###728 Right, and all the gunshots and ghetto birds.
###731 Ghetto birds?
###732 She means helicopters.
###733 Ah, <i>Boyz n the Hood,</i> domino.
###736 You know, we at the foundation
###738 were shocked when we found out that Kevin is a baseball fan.
###741 Why is that?
###743 Well, most kids in Kevin's situation
###745 are more inclined to be basketball fans.
###748 Ah.
###748 You know, pass me the rock.
###750 Hitting the tre. And one.
###752 I'm open, homey. I'm open.
###754 Pass it. Pass it.
###755 We get it. Yeah.
###756 Well, Kevin here is definitely a baseball fan,
###759 especially when it comes to A-Rod.
###761 Am I right, Kevin?
###763 Right.
###764 I am definitely a fan of A-Rod,
###765 who was drafted by the Mariners in 1993.
###769 Yeah.
###770 And I love baseball.
###772 Oh, he is so articulate.
###774 I understood every word he said.
###778 Who are your other favorites, Kevin?
###779 Uh, b-rod and his brother c-rod
###784 and his other brother d-rod.
###786 Ah, you're a comedian.
###787 Yes. Yes, he is.
###788 He's like a little <i>Original Kings of Comedy.</i>
###790 Get you a nine-button purple suit
###792 and a hat,
###793 put you on tour?
###794 Okay, listen, we know your time is valuable.
###797 You probably have some rally to attend.
###799 So if I could just get that bat from you
###802 for little Kevin here.
###803 Oh, well, that is exactly
###805 what I came to talk to you about.
###807 We talked to A-Rod's people
###809 and told them Kevin's story,
###811 and he has agreed to let you
###812 come to the game today as his special guest,
###815 where he'll sign the bat for you in person.
###817 Isn't that great?
###818 So you don't have the bat?
###819 No, well, I was worried about bringing it here.
###822 But he'll sign it at the game in person.
###824 Isn't that great?
###826 Yeah, wonderful, mm-hmm.
###828 Do I really have to go?
###830 Oh, don't worry.
###831 There are no metal detectors.
###833 What?
###834 You can wear your bling.
###839 Suzanne!
###841 Yeah?
###842 I need you to help me find the J. Crew sweater
###845 Michelle Obama was wearing the other day.
###847 What? What are you talking about?
###849 Well, after you told me how valuable they were,
###851 I posted one online for sale,
###853 and the bidding price is skyrocketing.
###856 But you don't actually have one to sell.
###858 Right, I thought I could just
###859 go down to the store and buy one,
###860 but those things are impossible to find.
###862 That's why they're so valuable.
###864 Well, I know that now.
###867 I'm gonna change the channel from <i>Sportscenter.</i>
###869 Is that okay?
###870 Yes.
###871 Can I say hi to Gigi?
###872 Yes.
###873 Hi, Gigi.
###874 Hi.
###876 You know what?
###877 You should have let Lindsey get that sweater.
###879 Why?
###880 Because then you could have told her
###881 she couldn't have it,
###882 and then you could have given it to me.
###884 As a matter of fact, Lindsey did buy the sweater,
###885 and I did tell her she couldn't have it.
###887 Great. Can I have it?
###888 No. I'm making her take it back.
###890 Well, how do you take something back to the Internet?
###893 She's taking it back to the mall.
###895 Can I watch a cool thing about cheetahs
###897 on the Discovery Channel?
###899 Yes.
###902 You know what?
###903 You can't take that sweater back to the mall.
###905 I'll buy it from you.
###907 With what?
###908 I'll give you a cut.
###909 How you gonna give me a cut
###910 of something you don't have?
###913 Besides, Gigi, it's not about the money.
###915 It's about the principle.
###916 Oh, please.
###918 I've said that before, and believe me,
###919 it's about the money.
###920 How much?
###921 I'm not selling you the sweater.
###923 Can I put my feet up on the coffee table?
###925 Yes.
###929 I can't believe
###931 you're gonna sacrifice hundreds of dollars
###932 just to teach your daughter a lesson
###934 when you could teach her two lessons.
###935 One: Do not disobey your mother.
###937 Two: Even you can earn money
###939 in the comfort and privacy of your own home.
###943 No.
###945 Three: It's better to give than to receive.
###950 Sometimes.
###952 No.
###959 You're lucky all you do is bobble, Chuck.
###962 Oh, you know, I'm sorry.
###963 I probably shouldn't be talking to you.
###964 I didn't ask permission.
###966 [Knocking]
###967 Hey.
###969 Hey, honey.
###971 What are you doing?
###972 Breathing.
###973 Oh, is that okay?
###975 Nick, I shouldn't have blamed you for what Lindsey did.
###979 I was angry, and I'm sorry.
###981 Thank you.
###982 Come here, babe.
###988 Look, Lindsey saved up for a sweater
###990 Michelle Obama was wearing.
###992 She wants to dress like the first lady.
###994 I could think of a lot worse things.
###996 She could be looking up to Amy Winehouse,
###999 Heidi Montag, Courtney Love,
###1002 the Real Housewives of Orange County,
###1004 you know, white women.
###1007 You're right.
###1009 Hey, where's Kevin?
###1010 I haven't seen him all day.
###1012 I told him he could hang out with Martin.
###1014 Why would Martin want to hang out with a ten-year-old?
###1017 He said he wanted to teach him guy stuff.
###1019 Well, he could have just stayed here with you
###1021 and watched baseball.
###1023 [Crowd cheering]
###1024 Ladies and gentlemen,
###1025 this is a truly heartwarming story.
###1028 A-Rod is dedicating this at bat
###1030 to young Kevin Martin,
###1031 an orphan whose drug-addicted parents
###1033 gave him up for an eight ball.
###1035 Gave him up for an eight ball?
###1037 That is awful.
###1040 Oh, my God! That's Kevin!
###1042 What?
###1043 Poor kid.
###1044 Kevin Martin's cracked-out parents
###1045 should be ashamed of themselves.
###1047 Crack?
###1048 I'm not on crack!
###1049 Kevin Martin?
###1051 Did Martin have something to do with this?
###1053 And A-Rod steps up to the plate
###1055 and points to the bleachers.
###1057 Oh, he's gonna hit a home run for poor little Kevin.
###1061 First pitch,
###1062 and it's a swing and a miss.
###1064 Strike one.
###1065 [Groans]
###1066 You suck, A-Rod.
###1067 Come on, man.
###1068 A-Rod steps back to the plate.
###1070 Here's the windup and the pitch,
###1072 and it's fouled away.
###1074 Both: What is wrong with you, man?
###1078 A-Rod just can't catch a break.
###1080 Here comes the pitch.
###1081 And it's a bunt.
###1082 A bunt?
###1083 A surprise bunt for young Kevin Martin.
###1087 And A-Rod's thrown out at first,
###1088 just like young Kevin was thrown out of life.
###1093 You do realize I'm gonna kill your friend.
###1105 Hey.
###1106 Hey.
###1108 Thank you for cleaning up the kitchen.
###1110 I'm sorry for disrespecting you
###1112 and lying to dad.
###1114 I just really wanted that sweater.
###1116 I know.
###1117 Can we do this?
###1119 Yeah.
###1120 Bam!
###1121 Really?
###1122 Mm-hmm.
###1124 [Gasps]
###1125 Thank you, mom.
###1126 You're welcome.
###1128 [Giggles]
###1131 She did a good job.
###1133 Yeah, look at this.
###1135 Oh, hey, guys. Hey.
###1138 Hey. Hey.
###1139 Kevin, did you have a good time with Martin?
###1141 It was cool.
###1142 What did you do?
###1143 We went to the Mariners-Yankees game.
###1145 You don't say. Oh, yeah.
###1148 I even got this bat signed by one Alex Rodriguez.
###1151 Mm.
###1153 I'll take that. Thank you.
###1155 Be careful with that.
###1156 It's worth $1,000.
###1158 $1,000?
###1159 I thought you said it was worth $500.
###1161 Yeah, I lied.
###1162 What else did you lie about, Martin?
###1165 Are you the one who told millions of people
###1168 that my child was a crack baby?
###1170 I never said that Kevin was a crack baby.
###1174 I said his mother was a crack whore.
###1177 [Doorbell rings]
###1178 You've got three seconds
###1179 to tell her I had nothing to do with this.
###1181 All right, fine. I admit it.
###1182 It was all my doing.
###1184 I mean, you know Nick, Suzanne.
###1185 Does he seem like he could come up
###1187 with a plan this complicated?
###1189 Fortunately, no one was harmed.
###1190 So can I get my bat, please?
###1192 Your bat?
###1194 You got this using my child under false pretenses.
###1198 Yeah.
###1199 That's why I said I was sorry.
###1202 This is my bat.
###1203 What?
###1205 Never trust a crack whore.
###1207 Suzanne, I'm in big trouble.
###1210 What's wrong?
###1211 I sold that Michelle Obama sweater online,
###1212 and now the winning bidder is threatening to sue me.
###1215 Here.
###1216 Maybe A-Rod can help you.
###1218 What am I gonna do with this?
###1220 Sell it to Martin for $1,000.
###1222 I'll give you $500.
###1223 I still need to make a profit on this.
###1225 $750.
###1226 You still get $250 out of it.
###1228 $650,
###1229 and I don't tell Suzanne what you said about her ankles.
###1232 I know my friend,
###1233 and she didn't say anything about my ankles.
###1236 $850.
###1237 Fine, deal.
###1239 What about my $100 buck?
###1241 $100. We agreed on $50.
###1243 That's when you said it was worth $500.
###1246 You're dead to me.
###1248 Kevin... you were in on this?
###1251 I only did it for the money.
