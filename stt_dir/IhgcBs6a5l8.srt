0:0:1,0 --> 0:0:16,733
[applause]


2
0:0:16,733 --> 0:0:20,466
Pausch: MAKE ME EARN IT.


3
0:0:20,466 --> 0:0:21,466
IT'S A--


4
0:0:21,466 --> 0:0:23,767
man: YOU DID.


5
0:0:23,767 --> 0:0:26,233
Pausch: IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE HERE.


6
0:0:26,233 --> 0:0:28,434
WHAT INDIRA DIDN'T TELL YOU IS THAT THIS LECTURE SERIES


7
0:0:28,434 --> 0:0:30,399
USED TO BE CALLED "THE LAST LECTURE."


8
0:0:30,399 --> 0:0:32,8
IF YOU HAD ONE LAST LECTURE TO GIVE BEFORE YOU DIED,


9
0:0:32,8 --> 0:0:34,99
WHAT WOULD IT BE?


10
0:0:34,99 --> 0:0:35,967
I THOUGHT, "DAMN, I FINALLY NAILED THE VENUE,


11
0:0:35,967 --> 0:0:37,8
AND THEY RENAMED IT."


12
0:0:37,8 --> 0:0:42,132
SO, YOU KNOW, IN CASE THERE'S ANYBODY WHO WANDERED IN


13
0:0:42,132 --> 0:0:43,5
AND DOESN'T KNOW THE BACKSTORY,


14
0:0:43,5 --> 0:0:44,868
MY DAD ALWAYS TAUGHT ME,


15
0:0:44,868 --> 0:0:47,0
WHEN THERE'S AN ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM, INTRODUCE THEM.


16
0:0:47,0 --> 0:0:49,433
IF YOU LOOK AT MY CAT SCANS,


17
0:0:49,433 --> 0:0:51,567
THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY TEN TUMORS IN MY LIVER,


18
0:0:51,567 --> 0:0:53,33
AND THE DOCTORS TOLD ME


19
0:0:53,33 --> 0:0:55,0
THREE TO SIX MONTHS OF GOOD HEALTH LEFT.


20
0:0:55,0 --> 0:0:58,266
THAT WAS A MONTH AGO, SO YOU CAN DO THE MATH.


21
0:0:58,266 --> 0:1:1,666
I HAVE SOME OF THE BEST DOCTORS IN THE WORLD.


22
0:1:1,666 --> 0:1:3,99
SO THAT IS WHAT IT IS.


23
0:1:3,99 --> 0:1:5,199
WE CAN'T CHANGE IT, AND WE JUST HAVE TO DECIDE


24
0:1:5,199 --> 0:1:6,6
HOW WE'RE GOING TO RESPOND TO THAT.


25
0:1:6,6 --> 0:1:8,433
WE CANNOT CHANGE THE CARDS WE ARE DEALT,


26
0:1:8,433 --> 0:1:10,6
JUST HOW WE PLAY THE HAND.


27
0:1:10,6 --> 0:1:14,433
IF I DON'T SEEM AS DEPRESSED OR MOROSE AS I SHOULD BE,


28
0:1:14,433 --> 0:1:15,7
SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU.


29
0:1:15,7 --> 0:1:18,467
[laughter]


30
0:1:18,467 --> 0:1:20,634
AND I ASSURE YOU, I AM NOT IN DENIAL.


31
0:1:20,634 --> 0:1:22,666
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M NOT AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON.


32
0:1:22,666 --> 0:1:26,32
MY FAMILY, MY THREE KIDS, MY WIFE, WE JUST DECAMPED.


33
0:1:26,32 --> 0:1:28,801
WE BOUGHT A LOVELY HOUSE IN CHESAPEAKE, VIRGINIA,


34
0:1:28,801 --> 0:1:30,199
NEAR NORFOLK, AND WE'RE DOING THAT


35
0:1:30,199 --> 0:1:31,366
BECAUSE THAT'S A BETTER PLACE


36
0:1:31,366 --> 0:1:33,734
FOR THE FAMILY TO BE, DOWN THE ROAD.


37
0:1:33,734 --> 0:1:34,901
AND THE OTHER THING IS


38
0:1:34,901 --> 0:1:36,666
I AM IN PHENOMENALLY GOOD HEALTH RIGHT NOW.


39
0:1:36,666 --> 0:1:37,968
I MEAN, IT'S THE GREATEST THING


40
0:1:37,968 --> 0:1:40,366
OF COGNITIVE DISSONANCE YOU WILL EVER SEE


41
0:1:40,366 --> 0:1:42,933
IS THE FACT THAT I AM IN REALLY GOOD SHAPE.


42
0:1:42,933 --> 0:1:47,0
IN FACT, I'M IN BETTER SHAPE THAN MOST OF YOU.


43
0:1:47,0 --> 0:1:58,433
[applause]


44
0:1:58,433 --> 0:2:0,333
SO ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO CRY OR PITY ME


45
0:2:0,333 --> 0:2:1,933
CAN COME DOWN AND DO A FEW OF THOSE,


46
0:2:1,933 --> 0:2:3,5
AND THEN YOU MAY PITY ME.


47
0:2:3,5 --> 0:2:5,366
[laughter]


48
0:2:5,366 --> 0:2:7,4
ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT TODAY,


49
0:2:7,4 --> 0:2:9,333
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT CANCER,


50
0:2:9,333 --> 0:2:11,233
BECAUSE I SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT THAT,


51
0:2:11,233 --> 0:2:12,567
AND I'M REALLY NOT INTERESTED.


52
0:2:12,567 --> 0:2:14,399
IF YOU HAVE ANY HERBAL SUPPLEMENTS OR REMEDIES,


53
0:2:14,399 --> 0:2:15,533
PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM ME.


54
0:2:15,533 --> 0:2:17,67
[laughter]


55
0:2:17,67 --> 0:2:18,634
AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THINGS


56
0:2:18,634 --> 0:2:19,766
THAT ARE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT


57
0:2:19,766 --> 0:2:21,466
THAN ACHIEVING YOUR CHILDHOOD DREAMS.


58
0:2:21,466 --> 0:2:22,934
WE'RE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT MY WIFE.


59
0:2:22,934 --> 0:2:24,867
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT MY KIDS, BECAUSE I'M GOOD,


60
0:2:24,867 --> 0:2:25,968
BUT I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH


61
0:2:25,968 --> 0:2:27,501
TO TALK ABOUT THAT WITHOUT TEARING UP.


62
0:2:27,501 --> 0:2:29,266
SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO TAKE THAT OFF THE TABLE.


63
0:2:29,266 --> 0:2:31,367
THAT'S MUCH MORE IMPORTANT.


64
0:2:31,367 --> 0:2:34,67
AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT SPIRITUALITY AND RELIGION.


65
0:2:34,67 --> 0:2:35,968
ALTHOUGH I WILL TELL YOU THAT I HAVE EXPERIENCED


66
0:2:35,968 --> 0:2:38,266
A DEATHBED CONVERSION.


67
0:2:38,266 --> 0:2:39,867
I JUST BOUGHT A MACINTOSH.


68
0:2:39,867 --> 0:2:48,901
[applause]


69
0:2:48,901 --> 0:2:53,3
NOW, I KNEW I'D GET 9% OF THE AUDIENCE WITH THAT.


70
0:2:53,3 --> 0:2:55,501
ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT IS TODAY'S TALK ABOUT THEN?


71
0:2:55,501 --> 0:2:59,533
IT'S ABOUT MY CHILDHOOD DREAMS AND HOW I HAVE ACHIEVED THEM--


72
0:2:59,533 --> 0:3:1,434
I'VE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE THAT WAY--


73
0:3:1,434 --> 0:3:3,6
HOW I BELIEVE I'VE BEEN ABLE TO ENABLE THE DREAMS--


74
0:3:3,6 --> 0:3:6,634
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO ENABLE THE DREAMS OF OTHERS,


75
0:3:6,634 --> 0:3:8,833
AND TO SOME DEGREE, LESSONS LEARNED--


76
0:3:8,833 --> 0:3:9,968
I'M A PROFESSOR;


77
0:3:9,968 --> 0:3:12,1
THERE SHOULD BE SOME LESSONS LEARNED--


78
0:3:12,1 --> 0:3:14,766
AND HOW YOU CAN USE THE STUFF YOU HEAR TODAY


79
0:3:14,766 --> 0:3:17,501
TO ACHIEVE YOUR DREAMS OR ENABLE THE DREAMS OF OTHERS.


80
0:3:17,501 --> 0:3:19,0
AND AS YOU GET OLDER, YOU MAY FIND


81
0:3:19,0 --> 0:3:20,701
THAT ENABLING THE DREAMS OF OTHERS THING


82
0:3:20,701 --> 0:3:22,901
IS EVEN MORE FUN.


83
0:3:22,901 --> 0:3:24,833
SO WHAT WERE MY CHILDHOOD DREAMS?


84
0:3:24,833 --> 0:3:27,3
WELL, YOU KNOW, I HAD A REALLY GOOD CHILDHOOD,


85
0:3:27,3 --> 0:3:28,833
I MEAN, NO KIDDING AROUND.


86
0:3:28,833 --> 0:3:31,233
I WAS GOING BACK THROUGH THE FAMILY ARCHIVES,


87
0:3:31,233 --> 0:3:33,67
AND WHAT WAS REALLY AMAZING WAS,


88
0:3:33,67 --> 0:3:35,1
I COULDN'T FIND ANY PICTURES OF ME AS A KID


89
0:3:35,1 --> 0:3:37,466
WHERE I WASN'T SMILING, ALL RIGHT?


90
0:3:37,466 --> 0:3:42,833
AND THAT WAS JUST A VERY GRATIFYING THING.


91
0:3:42,833 --> 0:3:45,399
THERE WAS OUR DOG, RIGHT?


92
0:3:45,399 --> 0:3:47,934
AW, THANK YOU.


93
0:3:47,934 --> 0:3:50,901
AND THERE I ACTUALLY HAVE A PICTURE OF ME DREAMING.


94
0:3:50,901 --> 0:3:53,132
[laughter]


95
0:3:53,132 --> 0:3:54,533
AND I DID A LOT OF THAT.


96
0:3:54,533 --> 0:3:58,1
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A LOT OF "WAKE UPS," YOU KNOW?


97
0:3:58,1 --> 0:4:1,266
AND IT WAS AN EASY TIME TO DREAM.


98
0:4:1,266 --> 0:4:5,1
I WAS BORN IN 1960, ALL RIGHT?


99
0:4:5,1 --> 0:4:6,968
WHEN YOU'RE EIGHT OR NINE YEARS OLD


100
0:4:6,968 --> 0:4:9,766
AND YOU LOOK AT THE TV SET AND MEN ARE LANDING ON THE MOON,


101
0:4:9,766 --> 0:4:11,833
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE,


102
0:4:11,833 --> 0:4:15,199
AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD NOT LOSE SIGHT OF,


103
0:4:15,199 --> 0:4:16,566
IS THAT THE INSPIRATION


104
0:4:16,566 --> 0:4:20,266
AND THE PERMISSION TO DREAM IS HUGE.


105
0:4:20,266 --> 0:4:22,2
SO WHAT WERE MY CHILDHOOD DREAMS?


106
0:4:22,2 --> 0:4:24,933
YOU MAY NOT AGREE WITH THIS LIST, BUT I WAS THERE.


107
0:4:24,933 --> 0:4:26,734
[laughter]


108
0:4:26,734 --> 0:4:28,132
BEING IN ZERO GRAVITY,


109
0:4:28,132 --> 0:4:29,901
PLAYING IN THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE,


110
0:4:29,901 --> 0:4:32,634
AUTHORING AN ARTICLE IN THE "WORLD BOOK" ENCYCLOPEDIA--


111
0:4:32,634 --> 0:4:34,399
I GUESS YOU CAN TELL THE NERDS EARLY--


112
0:4:34,399 --> 0:4:35,868
[laughter]


113
0:4:35,868 --> 0:4:37,634
BEING CAPTAIN KIRK.


114
0:4:37,634 --> 0:4:40,433
ANYBODY HERE HAVE THAT CHILDHOOD DREAM?


115
0:4:40,433 --> 0:4:42,666
NOT AT CMU, NO.


116
0:4:42,666 --> 0:4:44,334
I WANTED TO BECOME ONE OF THE GUYS


117
0:4:44,334 --> 0:4:46,501
WHO WON THE BIG STUFFED ANIMALS IN THE AMUSEMENT PARK,


118
0:4:46,501 --> 0:4:48,8
AND I WANTED TO BE AN IMAGINEER WITH DISNEY.


119
0:4:48,8 --> 0:4:50,634
THESE ARE NOT SORTED IN ANY PARTICULAR ORDER,


120
0:4:50,634 --> 0:4:52,501
ALTHOUGH I THINK THEY DO GET HARDER,


121
0:4:52,501 --> 0:4:54,8
EXCEPT FOR MAYBE THE FIRST ONE.


122
0:4:54,8 --> 0:4:56,734
OKAY SO BEING IN ZERO GRAVITY.


123
0:4:56,734 --> 0:4:58,533
NOW, IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE SPECIFIC DREAMS.


124
0:4:58,533 --> 0:5:0,0
I DID NOT DREAM OF BEING AN ASTRONAUT,


125
0:5:0,0 --> 0:5:1,868
BECAUSE WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID, I WORE GLASSES,


126
0:5:1,868 --> 0:5:3,933
AND THEY TOLD ME "OH, ASTRONAUTS CAN'T HAVE GLASSES."


127
0:5:3,933 --> 0:5:5,467
AND I WAS LIKE, "MM, I DIDN'T REALLY WANT


128
0:5:5,467 --> 0:5:8,66
THE WHOLE ASTRONAUT GIG; I JUST WANTED THE FLOATING."


129
0:5:8,66 --> 0:5:10,501
SO--AND AS A CHILD--


130
0:5:10,501 --> 0:5:14,166
[laughter]


131
0:5:14,166 --> 0:5:17,299
PROTOTYPE 0.0.


132
0:5:17,299 --> 0:5:21,566
BUT THAT DIDN'T WORK SO WELL, AND IT TURNS OUT THAT NASA


133
0:5:21,566 --> 0:5:24,367
HAS SOMETHING CALLED THE VOMIT COMET


134
0:5:24,367 --> 0:5:25,933
THAT THEY USE TO TRAIN THE ASTRONAUTS,


135
0:5:25,933 --> 0:5:28,634
AND THIS THING DOES PARABOLIC ARCS,


136
0:5:28,634 --> 0:5:29,967
AND AT THE TOP OF EACH ARC,


137
0:5:29,967 --> 0:5:31,868
YOU GET ABOUT 25 SECONDS WHERE YOU'RE BALLISTIC


138
0:5:31,868 --> 0:5:35,0
AND YOU GET ABOUT A ROUGH EQUIVALENT OF WEIGHTLESSNESS


139
0:5:35,0 --> 0:5:36,2
FOR ABOUT 25 SECONDS.


140
0:5:36,2 --> 0:5:39,299
AND THERE IS A PROGRAM WHERE COLLEGE STUDENTS


141
0:5:39,299 --> 0:5:41,533
CAN SUBMIT PROPOSALS,


142
0:5:41,533 --> 0:5:45,734
AND IF THEY WIN THE COMPETITION, THEY GET TO FLY,


143
0:5:45,734 --> 0:5:47,234
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS REALLY COOL,


144
0:5:47,234 --> 0:5:48,933
AND WE HAD A TEAM, AND WE PUT A TEAM TOGETHER,


145
0:5:48,933 --> 0:5:50,433
AND THEY WON, AND THEY GOT TO FLY,


146
0:5:50,433 --> 0:5:53,666
AND I WAS ALL EXCITED BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO GO WITH THEM...


147
0:5:53,666 --> 0:5:55,766
AND THEN I HIT THE FIRST BRICK WALL,


148
0:5:55,766 --> 0:5:57,299
BECAUSE THEY MADE IT VERY CLEAR


149
0:5:57,299 --> 0:6:0,933
THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WERE FACULTY MEMBERS


150
0:6:0,933 --> 0:6:3,2
ALLOWED TO FLY WITH THE TEAMS.


151
0:6:3,2 --> 0:6:5,967
I KNOW. I WAS HEARTBROKEN, RIGHT.


152
0:6:5,967 --> 0:6:10,634
I WAS LIKE, "BUT I WORKED SO HARD."


153
0:6:10,634 --> 0:6:13,666
AND SO I READ THE LITERATURE VERY CAREFULLY,


154
0:6:13,666 --> 0:6:15,467
AND IT TURNS OUT THAT NASA--


155
0:6:15,467 --> 0:6:18,166
IT'S PART OF THEIR OUTREACH AND PUBLICITY PROGRAM,


156
0:6:18,166 --> 0:6:20,601
AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THE STUDENTS WERE ALLOWED


157
0:6:20,601 --> 0:6:24,234
TO BRING A LOCAL MEDIA JOURNALIST FROM THEIR HOMETOWN.


158
0:6:24,234 --> 0:6:32,433
[laughter]


159
0:6:32,433 --> 0:6:35,2
RANDY PAUSCH, WEB JOURNALIST.


160
0:6:35,2 --> 0:6:36,734
IT'S REALLY EASY TO GET A PRESS PASS.


161
0:6:36,734 --> 0:6:40,1
SO I CALLED UP THE GUYS AT NASA, AND I SAID,


162
0:6:40,1 --> 0:6:41,933
"I NEED TO KNOW WHERE TO FAX SOME DOCUMENTS."


163
0:6:41,933 --> 0:6:44,234
AND THEY SAID, "WHAT DOCUMENTS ARE YOU GOING TO FAX US?"


164
0:6:44,234 --> 0:6:46,666
I SAID, "MY RESIGNATION AS THE FACULTY ADVISOR


165
0:6:46,666 --> 0:6:50,734
AND MY APPLICATION AS THE JOURNALIST."


166
0:6:50,734 --> 0:6:55,566
AND HE SAID, "THAT'S A LITTLE TRANSPARENT, DON'T YOU THINK?"


167
0:6:55,566 --> 0:6:58,2
AND I SAID, "YEAH, BUT OUR PROJECT IS VIRTUAL REALITY,


168
0:6:58,2 --> 0:7:1,299
"AND WE'RE GOING TO BRING DOWN A WHOLE BUNCH OF VR HEADSETS,


169
0:7:1,299 --> 0:7:3,299
"AND ALL THE STUDENTS FROM ALL THE TEAMS


170
0:7:3,299 --> 0:7:4,467
"ARE GOING TO EXPERIENCE IT


171
0:7:4,467 --> 0:7:6,66
"AND ALL THOSE OTHER REAL JOURNALISTS


172
0:7:6,66 --> 0:7:9,334
ARE GOING TO GET TO FILM IT."


173
0:7:9,334 --> 0:7:13,0
JIM FOLEY'S GOING, "OH, YOU BASTARD, YES."


174
0:7:13,0 --> 0:7:15,933
AND THE GUY SAID, "HERE'S THE FAX NUMBER."


175
0:7:15,933 --> 0:7:18,433
SO--AND INDEED, WE KEPT OUR END OF THE BARGAIN,


176
0:7:18,433 --> 0:7:20,132
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THEMES THAT YOU'LL HEAR


177
0:7:20,132 --> 0:7:21,399
LATER ON IN THE TALK


178
0:7:21,399 --> 0:7:23,334
IS HAVE SOMETHING TO BRING TO THE TABLE, RIGHT,


179
0:7:23,334 --> 0:7:26,132
BECAUSE THAT WILL MAKE YOU MORE WELCOMED.


180
0:7:26,132 --> 0:7:29,967
AND IF YOU'RE CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT ZERO GRAVITY LOOKS LIKE,


181
0:7:29,967 --> 0:7:36,367
HOPEFULLY THE SOUND WILL BE WORKING HERE.


182
0:7:36,367 --> 0:7:37,566
man: IT'S ON.


183
0:7:37,566 --> 0:7:40,834
woman: ALL RIGHT, GO GET 'EM, MAZI.


184
0:7:40,834 --> 0:7:42,967
THIS IS FANTASTIC.


185
0:7:42,967 --> 0:7:44,2
IT'S JUST AMAZING.


186
0:7:44,2 --> 0:7:47,234
IT'S NOTHING LIKE I EXPECTED.


187
0:7:47,234 --> 0:7:48,601
Pausch: THERE I AM.


188
0:7:48,601 --> 0:7:51,868
[laughter]


189
0:7:51,868 --> 0:7:54,234
woman: THIS IS AWESOME.


190
0:7:54,234 --> 0:7:57,467
[laughs]


191
0:7:57,467 --> 0:7:58,7
YOU GOT ONE, MAZI.


192
0:7:58,7 --> 0:8:0,1
THAT'S GOOD.


193
0:8:0,1 --> 0:8:1,766
man: GOT A BALL FOR YOU, MAZ.


194
0:8:1,766 --> 0:8:4,234
[laughter]


195
0:8:4,234 --> 0:8:9,299
Pausch: YOU DO PAY THE PIPER AT THE BOTTOM.


196
0:8:9,299 --> 0:8:13,399
SO CHILDHOOD DREAM NUMBER ONE, CHECK.


197
0:8:13,399 --> 0:8:15,0
ALL RIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT FOOTBALL.


198
0:8:15,0 --> 0:8:17,834
MY DREAM WAS TO PLAY IN THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE,


199
0:8:17,834 --> 0:8:20,601
AND MOST OF YOU DON'T KNOW THAT I ACTUALLY PLAYED--NO.


200
0:8:20,601 --> 0:8:22,901
[laughter]


201
0:8:22,901 --> 0:8:25,32
NO, I DID NOT MAKE IT TO THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE,


202
0:8:25,32 --> 0:8:29,1
BUT I PROBABLY GOT MORE FROM THAT DREAM


203
0:8:29,1 --> 0:8:30,8
AND NOT ACCOMPLISHING IT


204
0:8:30,8 --> 0:8:34,767
THAN I GOT FROM ANY OF THE ONES THAT I DID ACCOMPLISH.


205
0:8:34,767 --> 0:8:36,67
I HAD A COACH.


206
0:8:36,67 --> 0:8:37,5
I SIGNED UP WHEN I WAS NINE YEARS OLD.


207
0:8:37,5 --> 0:8:40,801
I WAS THE SMALLEST KID IN THE LEAGUE BY FAR,


208
0:8:40,801 --> 0:8:43,367
AND I HAD A COACH, JIM GRAHAM, WHO WAS 6'4".


209
0:8:43,367 --> 0:8:45,601
HE HAD PLAYED LINEBACKER AT PENN STATE.


210
0:8:45,601 --> 0:8:49,0
HE WAS JUST THIS HULK OF A GUY,


211
0:8:49,0 --> 0:8:52,33
AND HE WAS OLD SCHOOL, I MEAN, REALLY OLD SCHOOL.


212
0:8:52,33 --> 0:8:54,267
LIKE, HE THOUGHT THE FORWARD PASS WAS A TRICK PLAY.


213
0:8:54,267 --> 0:8:56,567
[laughter]


214
0:8:56,567 --> 0:8:58,601
AND HE SHOWED UP FOR PRACTICE THE FIRST DAY,


215
0:8:58,601 --> 0:9:0,601
AND, YOU KNOW, HE'S THIS BIG HULKING GUY.


216
0:9:0,601 --> 0:9:2,67
WE WERE ALL SCARED TO DEATH OF HIM,


217
0:9:2,67 --> 0:9:5,67
AND HE HADN'T BROUGHT ANY FOOTBALLS.


218
0:9:5,67 --> 0:9:8,533
HOW ARE WE GOING TO HAVE PRACTICE WITHOUT ANY FOOTBALLS?


219
0:9:8,533 --> 0:9:10,533
AND ONE OF THE OTHER KIDS SAID,


220
0:9:10,533 --> 0:9:13,99
"EXCUSE ME, COACH, BUT THERE'S NO FOOTBALL."


221
0:9:13,99 --> 0:9:15,0
AND COACH GRAHAM SAID, "RIGHT, HOW MANY MEN


222
0:9:15,0 --> 0:9:16,666
ARE ON A FOOTBALL FIELD AT A TIME?"


223
0:9:16,666 --> 0:9:18,633
"11 ON A TEAM, 22."


224
0:9:18,633 --> 0:9:20,2
AND COACH GRAHAM SAID,


225
0:9:20,2 --> 0:9:21,666
"ALL RIGHT, AND HOW MANY PEOPLE


226
0:9:21,666 --> 0:9:23,601
ARE TOUCHING THE FOOTBALL AT ANY GIVEN TIME?"


227
0:9:23,601 --> 0:9:24,867
"ONE OF THEM."


228
0:9:24,867 --> 0:9:26,567
AND HE SAID, "RIGHT, SO WE'RE GOING TO WORK


229
0:9:26,567 --> 0:9:29,333
ON WHAT THOSE OTHER 21 GUYS ARE DOING."


230
0:9:29,333 --> 0:9:31,666
AND THAT'S A REALLY GOOD STORY,


231
0:9:31,666 --> 0:9:33,901
BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT FUNDAMENTALS, FUNDAMENTALS,


232
0:9:33,901 --> 0:9:35,299
FUNDAMENTALS, FUNDAMENTALS.


233
0:9:35,299 --> 0:9:36,901
YOU'VE GOT TO GET THE FUNDAMENTALS DOWN,


234
0:9:36,901 --> 0:9:39,67
BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE FANCY STUFF ISN'T GOING TO WORK.


235
0:9:39,67 --> 0:9:40,968
AND THE OTHER JIM GRAHAM STORY I HAVE IS,


236
0:9:40,968 --> 0:9:42,67
THERE WAS ONE PRACTICE


237
0:9:42,67 --> 0:9:43,734
WHERE HE JUST RODE ME ALL PRACTICE.


238
0:9:43,734 --> 0:9:45,934
JUST, "YOU'RE DOING THIS WRONG. YOU'RE DOING THIS WRONG.


239
0:9:45,934 --> 0:9:47,333
"GO BACK AND DO IT AGAIN. YOU OWE ME.


240
0:9:47,333 --> 0:9:48,934
YOU'RE DOING PUSH-UPS AFTER PRACTICE."


241
0:9:48,934 --> 0:9:50,299
AND WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER,


242
0:9:50,299 --> 0:9:52,466
ONE OF THE OTHER ASSISTANT COACHES CAME OVER AND SAID,


243
0:9:52,466 --> 0:9:54,633
"YEAH, COACH GRAHAM RODE YOU PRETTY HARD, DIDN'T HE?"


244
0:9:54,633 --> 0:9:55,666
I SAID, "YEAH."


245
0:9:55,666 --> 0:9:56,867
HE SAID, "THAT'S A GOOD THING."


246
0:9:56,867 --> 0:9:58,833
HE SAID, "WHEN YOU'RE SCREWING UP


247
0:9:58,833 --> 0:10:1,333
"AND NOBODY'S SAYING ANYTHING TO YOU ANYMORE,


248
0:10:1,333 --> 0:10:5,0
THAT MEANS THEY GAVE UP."


249
0:10:5,0 --> 0:10:7,99
AND THAT'S A LESSON THAT STUCK WITH ME MY WHOLE LIFE


250
0:10:7,99 --> 0:10:9,968
IS THAT WHEN YOU SEE YOURSELF DOING SOMETHING BADLY


251
0:10:9,968 --> 0:10:12,33
AND NOBODY'S BOTHERING TO TELL YOU ANYMORE,


252
0:10:12,33 --> 0:10:13,867
THAT'S A VERY BAD PLACE TO BE.


253
0:10:13,867 --> 0:10:15,533
YOUR CRITICS ARE YOUR ONES TELLING YOU


254
0:10:15,533 --> 0:10:17,299
THEY STILL LOVE YOU AND CARE.


255
0:10:17,299 --> 0:10:18,968
AFTER COACH GRAHAM, I HAD ANOTHER COACH,


256
0:10:18,968 --> 0:10:20,267
COACH SETLIFF,


257
0:10:20,267 --> 0:10:22,367
AND HE TAUGHT ME A LOT ABOUT THE POWER OF ENTHUSIASM.


258
0:10:22,367 --> 0:10:25,0
HE DID THIS ONE THING WHERE ONLY FOR ONE PLAY AT A TIME,


259
0:10:25,0 --> 0:10:26,434
HE WOULD PUT PEOPLE IN AT, LIKE,


260
0:10:26,434 --> 0:10:29,801
THE MOST HORRIFICALLY WRONG POSITION FOR THEM.


261
0:10:29,801 --> 0:10:33,299
LIKE, ALL THE SHORT GUYS WOULD BECOME RECEIVERS, RIGHT?


262
0:10:33,299 --> 0:10:34,601
IT WAS JUST LAUGHABLE.


263
0:10:34,601 --> 0:10:37,666
BUT WE ONLY WENT IN FOR ONE PLAY, RIGHT?


264
0:10:37,666 --> 0:10:40,601
AND, BOY, THE OTHER TEAM JUST NEVER KNEW WHAT HIT 'EM,


265
0:10:40,601 --> 0:10:42,533
BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE ONLY DOING IT FOR ONE PLAY


266
0:10:42,533 --> 0:10:44,367
AND YOU'RE JUST NOT WHERE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE


267
0:10:44,367 --> 0:10:46,567
AND FREEDOM'S JUST ANOTHER WORD FOR NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE,


268
0:10:46,567 --> 0:10:48,333
BOY, ARE YOU GOING TO CLEAN SOMEBODY'S CLOCK


269
0:10:48,333 --> 0:10:49,901
FOR THAT ONE PLAY.


270
0:10:49,901 --> 0:10:51,666
AND THAT KIND OF ENTHUSIASM WAS GREAT,


271
0:10:51,666 --> 0:10:54,601
AND TO THIS DAY, I AM MOST COMFORTABLE ON A FOOTBALL FIELD.


272
0:10:54,601 --> 0:10:56,633
I MEAN, IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE,


273
0:10:56,633 --> 0:10:58,466
YOU KNOW, IF I'M WORKING A HARD PROBLEM,


274
0:10:58,466 --> 0:11:0,166
PEOPLE WILL SEE ME WANDERING THE HALLS


275
0:11:0,166 --> 0:11:2,567
WITH ONE OF THESE THINGS, AND THAT'S JUST BECAUSE,


276
0:11:2,567 --> 0:11:4,434
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING YOUNG ENOUGH


277
0:11:4,434 --> 0:11:5,666
AND YOU TRAIN FOR IT,


278
0:11:5,666 --> 0:11:7,67
IT JUST BECOMES A PART OF YOU,


279
0:11:7,67 --> 0:11:9,801
AND I'M VERY GLAD THAT FOOTBALL WAS A PART OF MY LIFE,


280
0:11:9,801 --> 0:11:11,901
AND IF I DIDN'T GET THE DREAM OF PLAYING IN THE NFL,


281
0:11:11,901 --> 0:11:13,67
THAT'S OKAY.


282
0:11:13,67 --> 0:11:15,33
I PROBABLY GOT STUFF MORE VALUABLE,


283
0:11:15,33 --> 0:11:17,99
BECAUSE LOOKING AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE NFL,


284
0:11:17,99 --> 0:11:20,99
I'M NOT SURE THOSE GUYS ARE DOING SO GREAT RIGHT NOW.


285
0:11:20,99 --> 0:11:21,5
OKAY.


286
0:11:21,5 --> 0:11:23,0
AND SO ONE OF THE EXPRESSIONS


287
0:11:23,0 --> 0:11:24,666
I LEARNED AT ELECTRONIC ARTS, WHICH I LOVE,


288
0:11:24,666 --> 0:11:26,833
WHICH PERTAINS TO THIS IS, "EXPERIENCE IS WHAT YOU GET


289
0:11:26,833 --> 0:11:29,166
WHEN YOU DIDN'T GET WHAT YOU WANTED."


290
0:11:29,166 --> 0:11:32,33
AND I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY LOVELY.


291
0:11:32,33 --> 0:11:33,901
AND THE OTHER THING ABOUT FOOTBALL IS,


292
0:11:33,901 --> 0:11:36,434
WE SEND OUR KIDS OUT TO PLAY FOOTBALL OR SOCCER


293
0:11:36,434 --> 0:11:37,968
OR SWIMMING OR WHATEVER IT IS,


294
0:11:37,968 --> 0:11:40,0
AND IT'S THE FIRST EXAMPLE OF WHAT I'M GOING TO CALL


295
0:11:40,0 --> 0:11:41,5
A HEAD FAKE OR INDIRECT LEARNING.


296
0:11:41,5 --> 0:11:43,434
WE ACTUALLY DON'T WANT OUR KIDS TO LEARN FOOTBALL.


297
0:11:43,434 --> 0:11:44,601
I MEAN, YEAH, IT'S REALLY NICE


298
0:11:44,601 --> 0:11:46,267
THAT I HAVE A WONDERFUL THREE-POINT STANCE


299
0:11:46,267 --> 0:11:47,666
AND THAT I KNOW HOW TO DO A CHOP BLOCK


300
0:11:47,666 --> 0:11:48,666
AND ALL THIS KIND OF STUFF.


301
0:11:48,666 --> 0:11:50,99
BUT WE SEND OUR KIDS OUT TO LEARN


302
0:11:50,99 --> 0:11:51,901
MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THINGS:


303
0:11:51,901 --> 0:11:54,601
TEAMWORK, SPORTSMANSHIP, PERSEVERANCE, ET CETERA,


304
0:11:54,601 --> 0:11:55,801
ET CETERA.


305
0:11:55,801 --> 0:11:58,99
AND THESE KINDS OF HEAD FAKE LEARNINGS


306
0:11:58,99 --> 0:12:0,801
ARE ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT,


307
0:12:0,801 --> 0:12:2,466
AND YOU SHOULD KEEP YOUR EYE OUT FOR THEM,


308
0:12:2,466 --> 0:12:4,0
BECAUSE THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.


309
0:12:4,0 --> 0:12:5,4
ALL RIGHT, A SIMPLE ONE,


310
0:12:5,4 --> 0:12:7,633
BEING AN AUTHOR IN THE "WORLD BOOK" ENCYCLOPEDIA.


311
0:12:7,633 --> 0:12:8,968
WHEN I WAS A KID,


312
0:12:8,968 --> 0:12:11,33
WE HAD THE "WORLD BOOK" ENCYCLOPEDIA ON THE SHELF.


313
0:12:11,33 --> 0:12:12,968
FOR THE FRESHMEN, THIS IS PAPER.


314
0:12:12,968 --> 0:12:15,934
[laughter]


315
0:12:15,934 --> 0:12:20,867
WE USED TO HAVE THESE THINGS CALLED BOOKS.


316
0:12:20,867 --> 0:12:23,466
AND AFTER I HAD BECOME SOMEWHAT OF AN AUTHORITY


317
0:12:23,466 --> 0:12:24,867
ON VIRTUAL REALITY, BUT NOT, LIKE,


318
0:12:24,867 --> 0:12:26,299
A REALLY IMPORTANT ONE--


319
0:12:26,299 --> 0:12:29,767
SO I WAS AT THE LEVEL OF PEOPLE THE "WORLD BOOK" WOULD BADGER--


320
0:12:29,767 --> 0:12:31,4
THEY CALLED ME UP, AND I WROTE AN ARTICLE,


321
0:12:31,4 --> 0:12:33,0
AND THIS IS CAITLIN KELLEHER.


322
0:12:33,0 --> 0:12:35,867
AND THERE'S AN ARTICLE IF YOU GO TO YOUR LOCAL LIBRARY


323
0:12:35,867 --> 0:12:37,968
WHERE THEY STILL HAVE COPIES OF THE "WORLD BOOK."


324
0:12:37,968 --> 0:12:39,533
LOOK UNDER "V" FOR VIRTUAL REALITY,


325
0:12:39,533 --> 0:12:40,533
AND THERE IT IS.


326
0:12:40,533 --> 0:12:43,0
AND ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT,


327
0:12:43,0 --> 0:12:44,767
HAVING BEEN SELECTED TO BE AN AUTHOR


328
0:12:44,767 --> 0:12:46,601
IN THE "WORLD BOOK" ENCYCLOPEDIA,


329
0:12:46,601 --> 0:12:49,767
I NOW BELIEVE THAT WIKIPEDIA IS A PERFECTLY FINE SOURCE


330
0:12:49,767 --> 0:12:50,968
FOR YOUR INFORMATION


331
0:12:50,968 --> 0:12:52,901
BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT THE QUALITY CONTROL IS


332
0:12:52,901 --> 0:12:54,267
FOR REAL ENCYCLOPEDIAS.


333
0:12:54,267 --> 0:12:56,833
THEY LET ME IN.


334
0:12:56,833 --> 0:12:58,867
ALL RIGHT, NEXT ONE.


335
0:12:58,867 --> 0:13:4,166
[laughter]


336
0:13:4,166 --> 0:13:5,633
AT A CERTAIN POINT, YOU JUST REALIZE


337
0:13:5,633 --> 0:13:7,367
THERE ARE SOME THINGS YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DO,


338
0:13:7,367 --> 0:13:14,801
SO MAYBE YOU JUST WANT TO STAND CLOSE TO THE PEOPLE.


339
0:13:14,801 --> 0:13:20,267
I MEAN, MY GOD, WHAT A ROLE MODEL FOR YOUNG PEOPLE.


340
0:13:20,267 --> 0:13:22,801
I MEAN, THIS IS EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO BE,


341
0:13:22,801 --> 0:13:24,801
AND WHAT I LEARNED THAT CARRIED ME FORWARD


342
0:13:24,801 --> 0:13:26,2
IN LEADERSHIP LATER IS THAT,


343
0:13:26,2 --> 0:13:28,33
YOU KNOW, HE WASN'T THE SMARTEST GUY ON THE SHIP.


344
0:13:28,33 --> 0:13:29,5
I MEAN, SPOCK WAS PRETTY SMART,


345
0:13:29,5 --> 0:13:32,67
AND MCCOY WAS THE DOCTOR, AND SCOTTY WAS THE ENGINEER,


346
0:13:32,67 --> 0:13:34,601
AND YOU SORT OF GO, "AND WHAT SKILL SET DID HE HAVE


347
0:13:34,601 --> 0:13:36,934
TO GET ON THIS DAMN THING AND RUN IT?"


348
0:13:36,934 --> 0:13:38,367
AND, YOU KNOW, CLEARLY THERE IS


349
0:13:38,367 --> 0:13:40,33
THIS SKILL SET CALLED LEADERSHIP,


350
0:13:40,33 --> 0:13:42,333
AND, YOU KNOW, WHETHER OR NOT YOU LIKE THE SERIES,


351
0:13:42,333 --> 0:13:44,466
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THERE WAS A LOT TO BE LEARNED


352
0:13:44,466 --> 0:13:48,466
ABOUT HOW TO LEAD PEOPLE BY WATCHING THIS GUY IN ACTION,


353
0:13:48,466 --> 0:13:52,901
AND HE JUST HAD THE COOLEST DAMN TOYS.


354
0:13:52,901 --> 0:13:56,968
I MEAN, MY GOD, HE, YOU KNOW--


355
0:13:56,968 --> 0:13:58,601
I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS FASCINATING AS A KID


356
0:13:58,601 --> 0:14:0,767
THAT HE HAD THIS THING AND HE COULD,


357
0:14:0,767 --> 0:14:2,567
YOU KNOW, TALK TO THE SHIP WITH IT.


358
0:14:2,567 --> 0:14:4,934
[electronic beeping]


359
0:14:4,934 --> 0:14:6,801
I JUST THOUGHT THAT WAS JUST SPECTACULAR,


360
0:14:6,801 --> 0:14:12,234
AND OF COURSE NOW I OWN ONE, AND IT'S SMALLER.


361
0:14:12,234 --> 0:14:15,833
SO THAT'S KIND OF COOL.


362
0:14:15,833 --> 0:14:21,67
SO I GOT TO ACHIEVE THIS DREAM.


363
0:14:21,67 --> 0:14:26,132
JAMES T. KIRK--HIS ALTER EGO WILLIAM SHATNER WROTE A BOOK,


364
0:14:26,132 --> 0:14:28,166
WHICH I THINK WAS ACTUALLY A PRETTY COOL BOOK.


365
0:14:28,166 --> 0:14:29,533
IT WAS WITH CHIP WALTER,


366
0:14:29,533 --> 0:14:32,367
WHO IS A PITTSBURGH-BASED AUTHOR WHO IS QUITE GOOD,


367
0:14:32,367 --> 0:14:34,67
AND THEY WROTE A BOOK ON BASICALLY


368
0:14:34,67 --> 0:14:35,5
THE SCIENCE OF STAR TREK, YOU KNOW,


369
0:14:35,5 --> 0:14:37,67
WHAT HAS COME TRUE,


370
0:14:37,67 --> 0:14:39,434
AND THEY WENT AROUND TO THE TOP PLACES AROUND THE COUNTRY


371
0:14:39,434 --> 0:14:40,801
AND LOOKED AT VARIOUS THINGS,


372
0:14:40,801 --> 0:14:42,934
AND THEY CAME HERE TO STUDY OUR VIRTUAL REALITY SETUP,


373
0:14:42,934 --> 0:14:45,567
AND SO WE BUILT A VIRTUAL REALITY FOR HIM.


374
0:14:45,567 --> 0:14:47,4
IT LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THAT.


375
0:14:47,4 --> 0:14:49,33
WE PUT IT IN, PUT IT TO RED ALERT.


376
0:14:49,33 --> 0:14:50,367
HE WAS A VERY GOOD SPORT.


377
0:14:50,367 --> 0:14:55,333
IT'S NOT LIKE HE SAW THAT ONE COMING.


378
0:14:55,333 --> 0:15:1,0
AND IT'S REALLY COOL TO MEET YOUR BOYHOOD IDOL,


379
0:15:1,0 --> 0:15:3,833
BUT IT'S EVEN COOLER WHEN HE COMES TO YOU


380
0:15:3,833 --> 0:15:8,234
TO SEE WHAT COOL STUFF YOU'RE DOING IN YOUR LAB,


381
0:15:8,234 --> 0:15:11,132
AND THAT WAS JUST A GREAT MOMENT.


382
0:15:11,132 --> 0:15:16,299
ALL RIGHT, WINNING STUFFED ANIMALS.


383
0:15:16,299 --> 0:15:17,901
THIS MAY SEEM MUNDANE TO YOU,


384
0:15:17,901 --> 0:15:20,67
BUT WHEN YOU'RE A LITTLE KID AND YOU SEE THE BIG BUFF GUYS


385
0:15:20,67 --> 0:15:21,5
WALKING AROUND AN AMUSEMENT PARK


386
0:15:21,5 --> 0:15:23,633
AND THEY'VE GOT ALL THESE BIG STUFFED ANIMALS, RIGHT?


387
0:15:23,633 --> 0:15:25,2
AND THIS IS MY LOVELY WIFE,


388
0:15:25,2 --> 0:15:29,633
AND I HAVE A LOT OF PICTURES OF STUFFED ANIMALS I'VE WON.


389
0:15:29,633 --> 0:15:33,767
THAT'S MY DAD POSING WITH ONE THAT I WON.


390
0:15:33,767 --> 0:15:36,267
I'VE WON A LOT OF THESE ANIMALS.


391
0:15:36,267 --> 0:15:37,601
THERE'S MY DAD.


392
0:15:37,601 --> 0:15:39,801
HE DID WIN THAT ONE TO HIS CREDIT.


393
0:15:39,801 --> 0:15:47,2
[laughter]


394
0:15:47,2 --> 0:15:48,466
RIGHT, AND THIS WAS JUST


395
0:15:48,466 --> 0:15:50,67
A BIG PART OF MY LIFE AND MY FAMILY'S LIFE,


396
0:15:50,67 --> 0:15:52,234
BUT, YOU KNOW, I CAN HEAR THE CYNICS.


397
0:15:52,234 --> 0:15:55,901
YOU KNOW, IN THIS AGE OF DIGITALLY MANIPULATED THINGS,


398
0:15:55,901 --> 0:15:58,833
MAYBE THOSE BEARS REALLY AREN'T IN THE PICTURES WITH ME,


399
0:15:58,833 --> 0:16:1,633
OR MAYBE I PAID SOMEBODY FIVE BUCKS


400
0:16:1,633 --> 0:16:3,901
TO TAKE A PICTURE IN THE THEME PARK NEXT TO THE BEAR.


401
0:16:3,901 --> 0:16:5,833
AND I SAID, "HOW, IN THIS AGE OF CYNICISM,


402
0:16:5,833 --> 0:16:7,666
CAN I CONVINCE PEOPLE?"


403
0:16:7,666 --> 0:16:11,234
AND I SAID, "I KNOW. I CAN SHOW THEM THE BEARS."


404
0:16:11,234 --> 0:16:16,67
BRING THEM OUT.


405
0:16:16,67 --> 0:16:19,968
[applause]


406
0:16:19,968 --> 0:16:22,2
IF YOU CAN JUST PUT 'EM RIGHT THERE.


407
0:16:22,2 --> 0:16:26,7
JUST PUT THEM BACK AGAINST THE WALL.


408
0:16:26,7 --> 0:16:30,968
woman: IT'S HARD TO HEAR YOU.


409
0:16:30,968 --> 0:16:35,5
Pausch: THANKS, HONEY.


410
0:16:35,5 --> 0:16:38,299
SO HERE ARE SOME BEARS.


411
0:16:38,299 --> 0:16:40,466
WE DIDN'T HAVE QUITE ENOUGH ROOM IN THE MOVING TRUCK


412
0:16:40,466 --> 0:16:42,166
DOWN TO CHESAPEAKE,


413
0:16:42,166 --> 0:16:44,7
AND ANYBODY WHO WOULD LIKE A LITTLE PIECE OF ME


414
0:16:44,7 --> 0:16:47,234
AT THE END OF THIS, FEEL FREE TO COME UP.


415
0:16:47,234 --> 0:16:50,67
FIRST COME, FIRST SERVE.


416
0:16:50,67 --> 0:16:53,734
ALL RIGHT, MY NEXT ONE, BEING AN IMAGINEER.


417
0:16:53,734 --> 0:16:55,2
THIS WAS THE HARD ONE.


418
0:16:55,2 --> 0:16:57,99
BELIEVE ME, GETTING TO ZERO GRAVITY


419
0:16:57,99 --> 0:16:59,934
IS EASIER THAN BECOMING AN IMAGINEER.


420
0:16:59,934 --> 0:17:2,934
WHEN I WAS A KID, I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD


421
0:17:2,934 --> 0:17:4,734
AND OUR FAMILY TOOK A TRIP CROSS-COUNTRY


422
0:17:4,734 --> 0:17:7,3
TO SEE DISNEYLAND, AND IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN THE MOVIE


423
0:17:7,3 --> 0:17:11,766
"NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION," IT WAS A LOT LIKE THAT.


424
0:17:11,766 --> 0:17:13,833
IT WAS A QUEST.


425
0:17:13,833 --> 0:17:17,801
AND THESE ARE REAL VINTAGE PHOTOGRAPHS,


426
0:17:17,801 --> 0:17:20,868
AND THERE I AM


427
0:17:20,868 --> 0:17:23,133
IN FRONT OF THE CASTLE, AND THERE I AM--


428
0:17:23,133 --> 0:17:25,133
AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE INTO FORESHADOWING,


429
0:17:25,133 --> 0:17:28,567
THIS IS THE ALICE RIDE.


430
0:17:28,567 --> 0:17:33,32
AND I JUST THOUGHT THIS WAS JUST THE COOLEST ENVIRONMENT


431
0:17:33,32 --> 0:17:34,6
I HAD EVER BEEN IN, AND INSTEAD OF SAYING,


432
0:17:34,6 --> 0:17:36,199
"GEE, I WANT TO EXPERIENCE THIS," I SAID,


433
0:17:36,199 --> 0:17:38,133
"I WANT TO MAKE STUFF LIKE THIS."


434
0:17:38,133 --> 0:17:40,266
AND SO I BIDED MY TIME,


435
0:17:40,266 --> 0:17:41,666
AND THEN I GRADUATED WITH MY PhD


436
0:17:41,666 --> 0:17:43,567
FROM CARNEGIE MELLON, THINKING THAT MEANT ME


437
0:17:43,567 --> 0:17:45,166
INFINITELY QUALIFIED TO DO ANYTHING,


438
0:17:45,166 --> 0:17:46,933
AND I DASHED OFF MY LETTERS OF APPLICATION


439
0:17:46,933 --> 0:17:48,4
TO WALT DISNEY IMAGINEERING,


440
0:17:48,4 --> 0:17:51,99
AND THEY SENT ME SOME OF THE DAMNED NICEST GO-TO-HELL LETTERS


441
0:17:51,99 --> 0:17:53,4
I HAVE EVER GOTTEN.


442
0:17:53,4 --> 0:17:55,734
I MEAN IT WAS JUST--


443
0:17:55,734 --> 0:17:58,433
"WE HAVE CAREFULLY REVIEWED YOUR APPLICATION,


444
0:17:58,433 --> 0:18:1,801
"AND PRESENTLY WE DO NOT HAVE ANY POSITIONS AVAILABLE


445
0:18:1,801 --> 0:18:5,199
WHICH REQUIRE YOUR PARTICULAR QUALIFICATIONS."


446
0:18:5,199 --> 0:18:7,701
NOW, THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU'RE GETTING THIS FROM A PLACE


447
0:18:7,701 --> 0:18:11,901
THAT'S FAMOUS FOR GUYS WHO SWEEP THE STREET.


448
0:18:11,901 --> 0:18:14,366
SO THAT WAS A BIT OF A SETBACK.


449
0:18:14,366 --> 0:18:18,634
BUT REMEMBER, THE BRICK WALLS ARE THERE FOR A REASON.


450
0:18:18,634 --> 0:18:20,833
ALL RIGHT, THE BRICK WALLS ARE NOT THERE TO KEEP US OUT.


451
0:18:20,833 --> 0:18:23,166
THE BRICK WALLS ARE THERE TO GIVE US A CHANCE


452
0:18:23,166 --> 0:18:26,166
TO SHOW HOW BADLY WE WANT SOMETHING,


453
0:18:26,166 --> 0:18:28,234
BECAUSE THE BRICK WALLS ARE THERE TO STOP THE PEOPLE


454
0:18:28,234 --> 0:18:30,766
WHO DON'T WANT IT BADLY ENOUGH.


455
0:18:30,766 --> 0:18:35,433
THEY'RE THERE TO STOP THE OTHER PEOPLE.


456
0:18:35,433 --> 0:18:37,734
ALL RIGHT, FAST FORWARD TO 1991.


457
0:18:37,734 --> 0:18:39,734
WE DID A SYSTEM BACK AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA


458
0:18:39,734 --> 0:18:42,234
CALLED VIRTUAL REALITY ON $5 A DAY,


459
0:18:42,234 --> 0:18:45,4
JUST ONE OF THOSE UNBELIEVABLE SPECTACULAR THINGS.


460
0:18:45,4 --> 0:18:48,801
I WAS SO SCARED BACK IN THOSE DAYS AS A JUNIOR ACADEMIC.


461
0:18:48,801 --> 0:18:51,534
JIM FOLEY'S HERE, AND I JUST LOVE TO TELL THIS STORY.


462
0:18:51,534 --> 0:18:53,833
HE KNEW MY UNDERGRADUATE ADVISOR, ANDY VAN DAM,


463
0:18:53,833 --> 0:18:56,266
AND I'M AT MY FIRST CONFERENCE, AND I'M JUST SCARED TO DEATH,


464
0:18:56,266 --> 0:18:59,6
AND THIS ICON IN THE USER INTERFACE COMMUNITY


465
0:18:59,6 --> 0:19:1,99
WALKS UP TO ME AND JUST OUT OF NOWHERE


466
0:19:1,99 --> 0:19:2,534
JUST GIVES ME THIS HUGE BEAR HUG,


467
0:19:2,534 --> 0:19:5,234
AND HE SAYS, "THAT WAS FROM ANDY."


468
0:19:5,234 --> 0:19:8,3
AND THAT WAS WHEN I THOUGHT, "OKAY, MAYBE I CAN MAKE IT.


469
0:19:8,3 --> 0:19:10,766
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW, MAYBE I DO BELONG."


470
0:19:10,766 --> 0:19:12,133
AND A SIMILAR STORY


471
0:19:12,133 --> 0:19:13,801
IS THAT THIS WAS JUST THIS UNBELIEVABLE HIT


472
0:19:13,801 --> 0:19:15,166
BECAUSE AT THE TIME,


473
0:19:15,166 --> 0:19:17,5
EVERYBODY NEEDED $1/2 MILLION TO DO VIRTUAL REALITY,


474
0:19:17,5 --> 0:19:18,833
AND EVERYBODY FELT FRUSTRATED,


475
0:19:18,833 --> 0:19:20,534
AND WE LITERALLY HACKED TOGETHER A SYSTEM


476
0:19:20,534 --> 0:19:23,766
FOR ABOUT $5,000 IN PARTS AND MADE A WORKING VR SYSTEM,


477
0:19:23,766 --> 0:19:25,234
AND PEOPLE WERE JUST LIKE, "OH MY GOD,


478
0:19:25,234 --> 0:19:27,534
THIS IS LIKE , YOU KNOW, THE HEWLETT-PACKARD GARAGE THING.


479
0:19:27,534 --> 0:19:29,32
THIS IS SO AWESOME."


480
0:19:29,32 --> 0:19:31,366
AND SO I'M GIVING THIS TALK, AND THE ROOM HAS JUST GONE WILD,


481
0:19:31,366 --> 0:19:33,67
AND DURING THE Q&A, A GUY NAMED TOM FURNESS,


482
0:19:33,67 --> 0:19:35,968
WHO WAS ONE OF THE BIG NAMES IN VIRTUAL REALITY AT THE TIME,


483
0:19:35,968 --> 0:19:38,133
HE GOES UP TO THE MICROPHONE, AND HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF.


484
0:19:38,133 --> 0:19:39,534
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE,


485
0:19:39,534 --> 0:19:40,801
BUT I SURE AS HELL KNEW THE NAME.


486
0:19:40,801 --> 0:19:42,366
AND HE ASKED A QUESTION, AND I WAS LIKE,


487
0:19:42,366 --> 0:19:44,766
"I'M SORRY, DID YOU SAY YOU'RE TOM FURNESS?"


488
0:19:44,766 --> 0:19:46,67
AND HE SAID, "YES."


489
0:19:46,67 --> 0:19:48,32
I SAID, "THEN I WOULD LOVE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION,


490
0:19:48,32 --> 0:19:50,32
BUT FIRST, WILL YOU HAVE LUNCH WITH ME TOMORROW?"


491
0:19:50,32 --> 0:19:52,199
[laughter]


492
0:19:52,199 --> 0:19:55,766
AND THERE'S A LOT IN THAT LITTLE MOMENT.


493
0:19:55,766 --> 0:19:57,234
RIGHT, THERE'S A LOT OF HUMILITY


494
0:19:57,234 --> 0:20:0,234
BUT ALSO ASKING A PERSON WHERE HE CAN'T POSSIBLY SAY NO.


495
0:20:0,234 --> 0:20:6,734
[laughter]


496
0:20:6,734 --> 0:20:9,199
AND SO IMAGINEERING A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER


497
0:20:9,199 --> 0:20:10,868
WAS WORKING ON A VIRTUAL REALITY PROJECT.


498
0:20:10,868 --> 0:20:12,3
THIS WAS TOP SECRET.


499
0:20:12,3 --> 0:20:15,701
THEY WERE DENYING THE EXISTENCE OF A VIRTUAL REALITY ATTRACTION


500
0:20:15,701 --> 0:20:18,67
AFTER THE TIME THAT THE PUBLICITY DEPARTMENT


501
0:20:18,67 --> 0:20:20,67
WAS RUNNING THE TV COMMERCIALS.


502
0:20:20,67 --> 0:20:23,3
SO IMAGINEERING REALLY HAD NAILED THIS ONE TIGHT.


503
0:20:23,3 --> 0:20:25,32
AND IT WAS THE ALADDIN ATTRACTION


504
0:20:25,32 --> 0:20:26,701
WHERE YOU WOULD FLY A MAGIC CARPET,


505
0:20:26,701 --> 0:20:31,133
AND THE HEAD-MOUNTED DISPLAY, SOMETIMES KNOWN AS GATOR VISION.


506
0:20:31,133 --> 0:20:33,833
AND SO I HAD AN IN.


507
0:20:33,833 --> 0:20:36,133
AS SOON AS THE PROJECT HAD JUST--


508
0:20:36,133 --> 0:20:38,133
YOU KNOW, THEY STARTED RUNNING THE TV COMMERCIALS,


509
0:20:38,133 --> 0:20:41,99
AND I HAD BEEN ASKED TO BRIEF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE


510
0:20:41,99 --> 0:20:42,366
ON THE STATE OF VIRTUAL REALITY.


511
0:20:42,366 --> 0:20:45,734
OKAY, FRED BROOKS AND I HAD BEEN ASKED


512
0:20:45,734 --> 0:20:47,833
TO BRIEF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE,


513
0:20:47,833 --> 0:20:51,4
AND THAT GAVE ME AN EXCUSE.


514
0:20:51,4 --> 0:20:52,534
SO I CALLED THEM UP.


515
0:20:52,534 --> 0:20:54,133
I CALLED IMAGINEERING, AND I SAID,


516
0:20:54,133 --> 0:20:56,0
"LOOK, I'M BRIEFING THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE.


517
0:20:56,0 --> 0:20:57,666
I'D LIKE SOME MATERIALS ON WHAT YOU HAVE,


518
0:20:57,666 --> 0:20:59,734
BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE BEST VR SYSTEMS IN THE WORLD."


519
0:20:59,734 --> 0:21:1,0
AND THEY KIND OF PUSHED BACK.


520
0:21:1,0 --> 0:21:2,901
AND I SAID, "LOOK, IS ALL THIS PATRIOTISM STUFF


521
0:21:2,901 --> 0:21:4,234
IN THE PARKS A FARCE?"


522
0:21:4,234 --> 0:21:7,467
AND THEY'RE LIKE, "HMM, OKAY," BUT THEY SAID,


523
0:21:7,467 --> 0:21:9,3
"BUT THE PR DEPARTMENT DOESN'T-- THIS IS SO NEW,


524
0:21:9,3 --> 0:21:11,366
"THE PR DEPARTMENT DOESN'T HAVE ANY FOOTAGE FOR YOU,


525
0:21:11,366 --> 0:21:12,868
"SO I'M GOING TO HAVE TO CONNECT YOU


526
0:21:12,868 --> 0:21:14,901
STRAIGHT THROUGH TO THE TEAM WHO DID THE WORK."


527
0:21:14,901 --> 0:21:16,933
JACKPOT.


528
0:21:16,933 --> 0:21:19,3
SO I FIND MYSELF ON THE PHONE WITH A GUY NAMED JON SNODDY


529
0:21:19,3 --> 0:21:21,634
WHO IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE GUYS


530
0:21:21,634 --> 0:21:22,968
I HAVE EVER MET,


531
0:21:22,968 --> 0:21:24,634
AND HE WAS THE GUY RUNNING THIS TEAM,


532
0:21:24,634 --> 0:21:27,166
AND IT'S NOT SURPRISING THEY HAD DONE IMPRESSIVE THINGS.


533
0:21:27,166 --> 0:21:28,901
AND SO HE SENT ME SOME STUFF.


534
0:21:28,901 --> 0:21:30,0
WE TALKED BRIEFLY.


535
0:21:30,0 --> 0:21:31,3
HE SENT ME SOME STUFF, AND I SAID,


536
0:21:31,3 --> 0:21:32,701
"HEY, I'M GOING TO BE OUT IN THE AREA


537
0:21:32,701 --> 0:21:33,901
"FOR A CONFERENCE SHORTLY.


538
0:21:33,901 --> 0:21:35,701
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GET TOGETHER AND HAVE LUNCH?"


539
0:21:35,701 --> 0:21:37,766
TRANSLATION: "I'M GOING TO LIE TO YOU


540
0:21:37,766 --> 0:21:39,534
"AND SAY THAT I HAVE AN EXCUSE TO BE IN THE AREA


541
0:21:39,534 --> 0:21:41,5
"SO I DON'T LOOK TOO ANXIOUS,


542
0:21:41,5 --> 0:21:45,3
BUT I WOULD GO TO NEPTUNE TO HAVE LUNCH WITH YOU."


543
0:21:45,3 --> 0:21:49,433
AND SO JON SAID, "SURE,"


544
0:21:49,433 --> 0:21:53,366
AND I SPENT SOMETHING LIKE 80 HOURS


545
0:21:53,366 --> 0:21:56,366
TALKING WITH ALL THE VR EXPERTS IN THE WORLD, SAYING,


546
0:21:56,366 --> 0:21:59,366
"IF YOU HAD ACCESS TO THIS ONE UNBELIEVABLE PROJECT,


547
0:21:59,366 --> 0:22:1,32
WHAT WOULD YOU ASK?"


548
0:22:1,32 --> 0:22:3,266
AND THEN I COMPILED ALL OF THAT, AND I HAD TO MEMORIZE IT,


549
0:22:3,266 --> 0:22:5,567
WHICH ANYBODY WHO KNOWS ME KNOWS THAT I HAVE NO MEMORY AT ALL,


550
0:22:5,567 --> 0:22:7,567
BECAUSE I COULDN'T GO IN LOOKING LIKE A DWEEB WITH,


551
0:22:7,567 --> 0:22:9,467
YOU KNOW, "HI, QUESTION 72."


552
0:22:9,467 --> 0:22:12,933
SO I WENT IN, AND THIS WAS, LIKE, A TWO-HOUR LUNCH,


553
0:22:12,933 --> 0:22:14,266
AND JON MUST HAVE THOUGHT


554
0:22:14,266 --> 0:22:17,4
HE WAS TALKING TO SOME PHENOMENAL PERSON,


555
0:22:17,4 --> 0:22:20,32
BECAUSE ALL I WAS DOING WAS CHANNELING FRED BROOKS


556
0:22:20,32 --> 0:22:21,666
AND IVAN SUTHERLAND AND ANDY VAN DAM


557
0:22:21,666 --> 0:22:23,3
AND PEOPLE LIKE THAT, AND HENRY FUCHS.


558
0:22:23,3 --> 0:22:24,968
SO IT'S PRETTY EASY TO BE SMART


559
0:22:24,968 --> 0:22:28,234
WHEN YOU'RE PARROTING SMART PEOPLE.


560
0:22:28,234 --> 0:22:31,467
AND AT THE END OF THE LUNCH WITH JON, I SORT OF,


561
0:22:31,467 --> 0:22:33,801
AS WE SAY IN THE BUSINESS, MADE "THE ASK."


562
0:22:33,801 --> 0:22:37,801
AND I SAID, "YOU KNOW, I HAVE A SABBATICAL COMING UP."


563
0:22:37,801 --> 0:22:38,968
AND HE SAID, "WHAT'S THAT?"


564
0:22:38,968 --> 0:22:43,868
[laughter]


565
0:22:43,868 --> 0:22:47,333
THE BEGINNINGS OF THE CULTURE CLASH.


566
0:22:47,333 --> 0:22:50,99
AND SO I TALKED WITH HIM ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY


567
0:22:50,99 --> 0:22:52,868
OF COMING THERE AND WORKING WITH HIM.


568
0:22:52,868 --> 0:22:56,333
AND HE SAID, "WELL, THAT'S REALLY GOOD EXCEPT,


569
0:22:56,333 --> 0:22:57,766
"YOU KNOW, YOU'RE IN THE BUSINESS


570
0:22:57,766 --> 0:22:59,99
"OF TELLING PEOPLE STUFF,


571
0:22:59,99 --> 0:23:1,901
AND WE'RE IN THE BUSINESS OF KEEPING SECRETS."


572
0:23:1,901 --> 0:23:3,467
ALL RIGHT, AND THEN WHAT MADE JON SNODDY


573
0:23:3,467 --> 0:23:6,166
JON SNODDY WAS HE SAID, "BUT WE'LL WORK IT OUT,"


574
0:23:6,166 --> 0:23:7,467
WHICH I REALLY LOVED.


575
0:23:7,467 --> 0:23:9,3
THE OTHER THING THAT I LEARNED FROM JON SNODDY--


576
0:23:9,3 --> 0:23:10,701
I COULD DO EASILY AN HOUR-LONG TALK


577
0:23:10,701 --> 0:23:12,4
JUST ON WHAT HAVE I LEARNED FROM JON SNODDY.


578
0:23:12,4 --> 0:23:14,199
ONE OF THE THINGS HE TOLD ME WAS THAT,


579
0:23:14,199 --> 0:23:17,32
"WAIT LONG ENOUGH, AND PEOPLE WILL SURPRISE AND IMPRESS YOU."


580
0:23:17,32 --> 0:23:18,766
HE SAID, "WHEN YOU'RE PISSED OFF AT SOMEBODY


581
0:23:18,766 --> 0:23:20,0
"AND YOU'RE ANGRY AT THEM,


582
0:23:20,0 --> 0:23:22,534
"YOU JUST HAVEN'T GIVEN THEM ENOUGH TIME.


583
0:23:22,534 --> 0:23:23,933
"JUST GIVE THEM A LITTLE MORE TIME,


584
0:23:23,933 --> 0:23:25,5
AND THEY'LL ALMOST ALWAYS IMPRESS YOU."


585
0:23:25,5 --> 0:23:26,868
AND THAT REALLY STUCK WITH ME.


586
0:23:26,868 --> 0:23:28,868
I THINK HE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ON THAT ONE.


587
0:23:28,868 --> 0:23:34,567
SO TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT, WE NEGOTIATED A LEGAL CONTRACT.


588
0:23:34,567 --> 0:23:35,968
IT WAS GOING TO BE THE FIRST--


589
0:23:35,968 --> 0:23:38,166
SOME PEOPLE REFERRED TO IT AS THE FIRST AND LAST PAPER


590
0:23:38,166 --> 0:23:39,968
EVER PUBLISHED BY IMAGINEERING--


591
0:23:39,968 --> 0:23:42,901
BUT THE DEAL WAS I GO, I PROVIDE MY OWN FUNDING,


592
0:23:42,901 --> 0:23:44,666
I GO FOR SIX MONTHS, I WORK WITH A PROJECT,


593
0:23:44,666 --> 0:23:47,666
WE PUBLISH A PAPER.


594
0:23:47,666 --> 0:23:51,901
AND THEN WE MEET OUR VILLAIN.


595
0:23:51,901 --> 0:23:53,333
I CAN'T BE ALL SWEETNESS AND LIGHT,


596
0:23:53,333 --> 0:23:54,868
BECAUSE I HAVE NO CREDIBILITY.


597
0:23:54,868 --> 0:23:57,234
SOMEBODY'S HEAD'S GOING TO GO ON A STICK.


598
0:23:57,234 --> 0:23:59,366
TURNS OUT THAT THE PERSON WHO GETS HIS HEAD ON THE STICK


599
0:23:59,366 --> 0:24:1,6
IS A DEAN BACK AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.


600
0:24:1,6 --> 0:24:2,666
HIS NAME IS NOT IMPORTANT.


601
0:24:2,666 --> 0:24:4,467
LET'S CALL HIM DEAN WORMER.


602
0:24:4,467 --> 0:24:9,933
[laughter]


603
0:24:9,933 --> 0:24:12,534
AND DEAN WORMER HAS A MEETING WITH ME WHERE I SAY,


604
0:24:12,534 --> 0:24:14,32
"I WANT TO DO THIS SABBATICAL THING,


605
0:24:14,32 --> 0:24:15,968
"AND I'VE ACTUALLY GOTTEN THE IMAGINEERING GUYS


606
0:24:15,968 --> 0:24:17,666
TO LET AN ACADEMIC IN," WHICH IS INSANE.


607
0:24:17,666 --> 0:24:19,266
I MEAN, IF JON HADN'T GONE NUTS,


608
0:24:19,266 --> 0:24:20,933
THIS WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN A POSSIBILITY.


609
0:24:20,933 --> 0:24:22,5
THIS IS A VERY SECRETIVE ORGANIZATION.


610
0:24:22,5 --> 0:24:23,801
AND DEAN WORMER LOOKS AT THE PAPERWORK, AND HE SAYS,


611
0:24:23,801 --> 0:24:25,199
"WELL, IT SAYS THEY'RE GOING TO OWN


612
0:24:25,199 --> 0:24:26,634
YOUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY."


613
0:24:26,634 --> 0:24:28,933
AND I SAID, "YEAH, WE GOT THE AGREEMENT TO PUBLISH THE PAPER.


614
0:24:28,933 --> 0:24:30,968
"THERE IS NO OTHER IP. I DON'T DO PATENTABLE STUFF."


615
0:24:30,968 --> 0:24:32,968
AND HE SAYS, "YEAH, BUT YOU MIGHT, SO DEAL'S OFF.


616
0:24:32,968 --> 0:24:36,234
"JUST GO AND GET THEM TO CHANGE THAT LITTLE CLAUSE THERE


617
0:24:36,234 --> 0:24:39,5
AND THEN COME BACK TO ME."


618
0:24:39,5 --> 0:24:41,634
I'M LIKE, "EXCUSE ME?"


619
0:24:41,634 --> 0:24:43,99
AND THEN I SAID TO HIM,


620
0:24:43,99 --> 0:24:45,32
"I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS.


621
0:24:45,32 --> 0:24:46,366
"IF WE CAN'T WORK THIS OUT,


622
0:24:46,366 --> 0:24:48,766
"I'M GOING TO TAKE AN UNPAID LEAVE OF ABSENCE,


623
0:24:48,766 --> 0:24:53,4
AND I'M JUST GOING TO GO THERE, AND I'M GOING TO DO THIS THING."


624
0:24:53,4 --> 0:24:55,901
AND HE SAID, "HEY, YOU KNOW,


625
0:24:55,901 --> 0:24:57,433
"I MIGHT NOT EVEN LET YOU DO THAT.


626
0:24:57,433 --> 0:24:59,266
"I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT THE IP IN YOUR HEAD ALREADY,


627
0:24:59,266 --> 0:25:1,166
"AND MAYBE THEY'RE GOING TO SUCK IT OUT OF YOU,


628
0:25:1,166 --> 0:25:3,6
SO THAT'S NOT GOING TO FLY EITHER."


629
0:25:3,6 --> 0:25:8,234
[laughter]


630
0:25:8,234 --> 0:25:12,366
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHEN YOU'RE IN A PISSING MATCH,


631
0:25:12,366 --> 0:25:13,467
AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT


632
0:25:13,467 --> 0:25:15,933
TO GET OUT OF IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.


633
0:25:15,933 --> 0:25:19,5
SO I SAID TO HIM, "WELL, LET'S BACK OFF ON THIS.


634
0:25:19,5 --> 0:25:21,766
DO WE THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA AT ALL?"


635
0:25:21,766 --> 0:25:24,6
HE SAID, "I HAVE NO IDEA IF THIS IS A GOOD IDEA, YOU KNOW."


636
0:25:24,6 --> 0:25:28,133
I WAS LIKE, "OKAY, WELL, WE'VE GOT COMMON GROUND THERE."


637
0:25:28,133 --> 0:25:29,933
THEN I SAID, "WELL, IS THIS REALLY YOUR CALL?


638
0:25:29,933 --> 0:25:32,3
ISN'T THIS THE CALL OF THE DEAN OF SPONSORED RESEARCH


639
0:25:32,3 --> 0:25:33,366
IF IT'S AN IP ISSUE?"


640
0:25:33,366 --> 0:25:34,734
AND HE SAID, "YEAH, THAT'S TRUE."


641
0:25:34,734 --> 0:25:36,433
I SAID, "BUT SO IF HE'S HAPPY, YOU'RE HAPPY?"


642
0:25:36,433 --> 0:25:37,433
"YEAH, THEN I'D BE FINE."


643
0:25:37,433 --> 0:25:38,433
pew!


644
0:25:38,433 --> 0:25:39,634
LIKE WILE E. COYOTE.


645
0:25:39,634 --> 0:25:41,234
AND I FIND MYSELF IN GENE BLOCK'S OFFICE,


646
0:25:41,234 --> 0:25:42,901
WHO IS THE MOST FANTASTIC MAN IN THE WORLD,


647
0:25:42,901 --> 0:25:44,6
AND I START TALKING TO GENE BLOCK, AND I SAY,


648
0:25:44,6 --> 0:25:45,868
"LET'S START AT THE HIGH LEVEL,"


649
0:25:45,868 --> 0:25:47,0
SINCE I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO BACK OUT AGAIN.


650
0:25:47,0 --> 0:25:48,333
"SO LET'S START AT THE HIGH LEVEL.


651
0:25:48,333 --> 0:25:49,801
DO YOU THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA?"


652
0:25:49,801 --> 0:25:51,868
HE SAID, "WELL, IF YOU'RE ASKING ME IF IT'S A GOOD IDEA,


653
0:25:51,868 --> 0:25:53,333
"I DON'T HAVE VERY MUCH INFORMATION.


654
0:25:53,333 --> 0:25:55,234
"ALL I KNOW IS THAT ONE OF MY STAR FACULTY MEMBERS


655
0:25:55,234 --> 0:25:56,5
"IS IN MY OFFICE, AND HE'S REALLY EXCITED,


656
0:25:56,5 --> 0:25:57,833
SO TELL ME MORE."


657
0:25:57,833 --> 0:25:59,901
HERE'S A LESSON FOR EVERYBODY IN ADMINISTRATION.


658
0:25:59,901 --> 0:26:3,99
THEY BOTH SAID THE SAME THING,


659
0:26:3,99 --> 0:26:7,0
BUT THINK ABOUT HOW THEY SAID IT, RIGHT?


660
0:26:7,0 --> 0:26:8,534
"I DON'T KNOW!"


661
0:26:8,534 --> 0:26:10,99
"WELL, I DON'T HAVE MUCH INFORMATION,


662
0:26:10,99 --> 0:26:12,67
"BUT ONE OF MY STAR FACULTY MEMBERS IS HERE,


663
0:26:12,67 --> 0:26:14,133
AND HE'S ALL EXCITED, SO I WANT TO LEARN MORE."


664
0:26:14,133 --> 0:26:15,868
THEY'RE BOTH WAYS OF SAYING I DON'T KNOW,


665
0:26:15,868 --> 0:26:18,67
BUT, BOY, THERE'S A GOOD WAY AND A BAD WAY.


666
0:26:18,67 --> 0:26:21,0
SO ANYWAY, WE GOT IT ALL WORKED OUT.


667
0:26:21,0 --> 0:26:23,901
I WENT TO IMAGINEERING, SWEETNESS AND LIGHT,


668
0:26:23,901 --> 0:26:29,433
AND ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL.


669
0:26:29,433 --> 0:26:33,3
SOME BRICK WALLS ARE MADE OF FLESH.


670
0:26:33,3 --> 0:26:35,4
SO I WORKED ON THE ALADDIN PROJECT.


671
0:26:35,4 --> 0:26:40,567
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR, I MEAN, JUST UNBELIEVABLE.


672
0:26:40,567 --> 0:26:41,868
HERE'S MY NEPHEW CHRISTOPHER.


673
0:26:41,868 --> 0:26:43,199
THIS WAS THE APPARATUS.


674
0:26:43,199 --> 0:26:45,266
YOU WOULD SIT ON THIS SORT OF MOTORCYCLE-TYPE THING,


675
0:26:45,266 --> 0:26:47,5
AND YOU WOULD STEER YOUR MAGIC CARPET,


676
0:26:47,5 --> 0:26:49,567
AND YOU WOULD PUT ON THE HEAD-MOUNTED DISPLAY.


677
0:26:49,567 --> 0:26:51,5
THE HEAD-MOUNTED DISPLAY WAS VERY INTERESTING.


678
0:26:51,5 --> 0:26:53,833
IT HAD TWO PARTS, AND IT WAS A VERY, VERY CLEVER DESIGN.


679
0:26:53,833 --> 0:26:55,467
TO GET THROUGHPUT THROUGH, THE ONLY PART


680
0:26:55,467 --> 0:26:57,467
THAT TOUCHED THE GUEST'S HEAD WAS THIS LITTLE CAP,


681
0:26:57,467 --> 0:26:58,933
AND EVERYTHING ELSE CLICKED ONTO IT,


682
0:26:58,933 --> 0:27:0,99
ALL THE EXPENSIVE HARDWARE.


683
0:27:0,99 --> 0:27:1,467
SO YOU COULD REPLICATE THE CAPS


684
0:27:1,467 --> 0:27:3,801
BECAUSE THEY WERE BASICALLY FREE TO MANUFACTURE.


685
0:27:3,801 --> 0:27:5,133
THIS IS WHAT I REALLY DID IS,


686
0:27:5,133 --> 0:27:8,933
I WAS A CAP CLEANER DURING THE SABBATICAL.


687
0:27:8,933 --> 0:27:11,5
I LOVED IMAGINEERING.


688
0:27:11,5 --> 0:27:15,333
IT WAS JUST A SPECTACULAR PLACE, JUST SPECTACULAR,


689
0:27:15,333 --> 0:27:16,666
EVERYTHING THAT I HAD DREAMED.


690
0:27:16,666 --> 0:27:18,0
I LOVED THE MODEL SHOP,


691
0:27:18,0 --> 0:27:20,6
PEOPLE CRAWLING AROUND ON THINGS THE SIZE OF THIS ROOM


692
0:27:20,6 --> 0:27:22,67
THAT ARE JUST BIG PHYSICAL MODELS.


693
0:27:22,67 --> 0:27:24,766
IT WAS JUST AN INCREDIBLE PLACE TO WALK AROUND


694
0:27:24,766 --> 0:27:26,366
AND BE INSPIRED.


695
0:27:26,366 --> 0:27:29,534
I'M ALWAYS REMINDED OF WHEN I WENT THERE AND PEOPLE SAID,


696
0:27:29,534 --> 0:27:31,3
"DO YOU THINK THE EXPECTATIONS ARE TOO HIGH?"


697
0:27:31,3 --> 0:27:32,666
AND I SAID, "YOU EVER SEE THE MOVIE


698
0:27:32,666 --> 0:27:34,199
"CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY"--


699
0:27:34,199 --> 0:27:35,801
"WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY"


700
0:27:35,801 --> 0:27:37,366
WHERE GENE WILDER SAYS TO THE LITTLE BOY CHARLIE--


701
0:27:37,366 --> 0:27:38,766
HE'S ABOUT TO GIVE HIM THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY.


702
0:27:38,766 --> 0:27:40,766
HE SAYS, "WELL, CHARLIE, DID ANYBODY EVER TELL YOU


703
0:27:40,766 --> 0:27:42,67
"THE STORY OF THE LITTLE BOY


704
0:27:42,67 --> 0:27:45,666
WHO SUDDENLY GOT EVERYTHING HE EVER WANTED?"


705
0:27:45,666 --> 0:27:48,199
CHARLIE'S EYES GET LIKE SAUCERS, AND HE SAYS,


706
0:27:48,199 --> 0:27:50,133
"NO, WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?"


707
0:27:50,133 --> 0:27:54,366
GENE WILDER SAYS, "HE LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER."


708
0:27:54,366 --> 0:27:56,766
OKAY, SO WORKING ON THE ALADDIN VR,


709
0:27:56,766 --> 0:27:57,968
I DESCRIBED IT AS


710
0:27:57,968 --> 0:27:59,734
A ONCE-IN-EVERY-FIVE-YEARS OPPORTUNITY,


711
0:27:59,734 --> 0:28:1,3
AND I STAND BY THAT ASSESSMENT.


712
0:28:1,3 --> 0:28:3,234
IT FOREVER CHANGED ME.


713
0:28:3,234 --> 0:28:4,833
IT WASN'T JUST THAT IT WAS GOOD WORK


714
0:28:4,833 --> 0:28:6,968
AND I GOT TO BE A PART OF IT,


715
0:28:6,968 --> 0:28:10,67
BUT IT GOT ME INTO THE PLACE OF WORKING WITH REAL PEOPLE


716
0:28:10,67 --> 0:28:12,6
AND REAL HCI USER INTERFACE ISSUES.


717
0:28:12,6 --> 0:28:15,67
MOST HCI PEOPLE LIVE IN THIS FANTASY WORLD


718
0:28:15,67 --> 0:28:18,701
OF WHITE COLLAR LABORERS WITH PhDs AND MASTER'S DEGREES.


719
0:28:18,701 --> 0:28:20,666
YOU KNOW, UNTIL YOU GOT ICE CREAM SPILLED ON YOU,


720
0:28:20,666 --> 0:28:23,901
YOU'RE NOT DOING FIELD WORK, ALL RIGHT?


721
0:28:23,901 --> 0:28:26,333
AND MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, FROM JON SNODDY I LEARNED


722
0:28:26,333 --> 0:28:28,467
HOW TO PUT ARTISTS AND ENGINEERS TOGETHER,


723
0:28:28,467 --> 0:28:30,4
AND THAT'S BEEN THE REAL LEGACY.


724
0:28:30,4 --> 0:28:31,6
WE PUBLISHED A PAPER,


725
0:28:31,6 --> 0:28:33,433
JUST A NICE ACADEMIC CULTURAL SCANDAL.


726
0:28:33,433 --> 0:28:35,6
WHEN WE WROTE THE PAPER, THE GUYS AT IMAGINEERING SAID,


727
0:28:35,6 --> 0:28:38,234
"WELL, LET'S DO A NICE BIG PICTURE


728
0:28:38,234 --> 0:28:39,968
LIKE YOU WOULD IN A MAGAZINE."


729
0:28:39,968 --> 0:28:42,67
AND THE SIGGRAPH COMMITTEE, WHICH ACCEPTED THE PAPER,


730
0:28:42,67 --> 0:28:43,6
IT WAS LIKE THIS BIG SCANDAL.


731
0:28:43,6 --> 0:28:45,467
"ARE THEY ALLOWED TO DO THAT?"


732
0:28:45,467 --> 0:28:47,6
[laughter]


733
0:28:47,6 --> 0:28:50,467
THERE WAS NO RULE.


734
0:28:50,467 --> 0:28:52,467
SO WE PUBLISHED THE PAPER, AND AMAZINGLY,


735
0:28:52,467 --> 0:28:54,467
SINCE THEN, THERE'S A TRADITION OF SIGGRAPH PAPERS


736
0:28:54,467 --> 0:28:57,67
HAVING COLOR FIGURES ON THE FIRST PAGE.


737
0:28:57,67 --> 0:29:0,766
SO I'VE CHANGED THE WORLD IN A SMALL WAY.


738
0:29:0,766 --> 0:29:4,32
AND THEN AT THE END OF MY SIX MONTHS,


739
0:29:4,32 --> 0:29:5,333
THEY CAME TO ME, AND THEY SAID,


740
0:29:5,333 --> 0:29:14,567
"YOU WANT TO DO IT FOR REAL? YOU CAN STAY."


741
0:29:14,567 --> 0:29:16,567
AND I SAID, "NO."


742
0:29:16,567 --> 0:29:19,0
ONE OF THE ONLY TIMES IN MY LIFE I HAVE SURPRISED MY FATHER.


743
0:29:19,0 --> 0:29:22,32
HE WAS LIKE, "YOU WHAT?"


744
0:29:22,32 --> 0:29:24,701
HE SAID, "SINCE YOU WERE, YOU KNOW, ALL YOU WANTED,


745
0:29:24,701 --> 0:29:27,666
AND NOW THAT YOU GOT IT, AND YOU'RE--HUH?"


746
0:29:27,666 --> 0:29:29,634
THERE WAS A BOTTLE OF MAALOX IN MY DESK DRAWER.


747
0:29:29,634 --> 0:29:30,833
BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR.


748
0:29:30,833 --> 0:29:32,534
IT WAS A PARTICULARLY STRESSFUL PLACE.


749
0:29:32,534 --> 0:29:35,534
IMAGINEERING IN GENERAL IS ACTUALLY NOT SO MAALOX-LADEN,


750
0:29:35,534 --> 0:29:39,67
BUT THE LAB I WAS IN-- OH, JON LEFT IN THE MIDDLE,


751
0:29:39,67 --> 0:29:41,666
AND IT WAS A LOT LIKE THE SOVIET UNION.


752
0:29:41,666 --> 0:29:44,133
IT WAS A LITTLE DICEY FOR A WHILE,


753
0:29:44,133 --> 0:29:45,5
BUT IT WORKED OUT OKAY,


754
0:29:45,5 --> 0:29:47,6
AND IF THEY HAD SAID, "STAY HERE


755
0:29:47,6 --> 0:29:49,67
OR NEVER WALK IN THE BUILDING AGAIN,"


756
0:29:49,67 --> 0:29:50,734
I WOULD HAVE DONE IT.


757
0:29:50,734 --> 0:29:52,467
I WOULD HAVE WALKED AWAY FROM TENURE.


758
0:29:52,467 --> 0:29:54,99
I WOULD HAVE JUST DONE IT.


759
0:29:54,99 --> 0:29:55,333
BUT THEY MADE IT EASY ON ME.


760
0:29:55,333 --> 0:29:57,266
THEY SAID, "YOU CAN HAVE YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO,"


761
0:29:57,266 --> 0:29:58,366
AND I BASICALLY BECOME


762
0:29:58,366 --> 0:30:0,133
A DAY-A-WEEK CONSULTANT FOR IMAGINEERING,


763
0:30:0,133 --> 0:30:1,634
AND I DID THAT FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS,


764
0:30:1,634 --> 0:30:3,99
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS


765
0:30:3,99 --> 0:30:5,701
YOU SHOULD ALL BECOME PROFESSORS,


766
0:30:5,701 --> 0:30:9,766
BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO, OKAY?


767
0:30:9,766 --> 0:30:11,968
I WENT ON AND CONSULTED ON THINGS LIKE DISNEYQUEST.


768
0:30:11,968 --> 0:30:13,801
SO THERE WAS THE VIRTUAL JUNGLE CRUISE


769
0:30:13,801 --> 0:30:16,833
AND THE BEST INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCE I THINK EVER DONE--


770
0:30:16,833 --> 0:30:18,968
AND JESSE SCHELL GETS THE CREDIT FOR THIS--


771
0:30:18,968 --> 0:30:23,67
PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN, WONDERFUL AT DISNEYQUEST.


772
0:30:23,67 --> 0:30:24,868
AND SO THOSE ARE MY CHILDHOOD DREAMS,


773
0:30:24,868 --> 0:30:27,0
AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.


774
0:30:27,0 --> 0:30:28,266
I FELT GOOD ABOUT THAT.


775
0:30:28,266 --> 0:30:29,968
SO THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES,


776
0:30:29,968 --> 0:30:33,32
HOW CAN I ENABLE THE CHILDHOOD DREAMS OF OTHERS?


777
0:30:33,32 --> 0:30:35,868
AND AGAIN, BOY, AM I GLAD I BECAME A PROFESSOR.


778
0:30:35,868 --> 0:30:41,868
WHAT BETTER PLACE TO ENABLE CHILDHOOD DREAMS?


779
0:30:41,868 --> 0:30:43,234
MAYBE WORKING AT EA, I DON'T KNOW.


780
0:30:43,234 --> 0:30:47,467
THAT'D PROBABLY BE A GOOD CLOSE SECOND.


781
0:30:47,467 --> 0:30:52,6
AND THIS STARTED IN A VERY CONCRETE REALIZATION


782
0:30:52,6 --> 0:30:54,4
THAT I COULD DO THIS,


783
0:30:54,4 --> 0:30:56,166
BECAUSE A YOUNG MAN NAMED TOMMY BURNETTE,


784
0:30:56,166 --> 0:30:58,199
WHEN I WAS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, CAME TO ME,


785
0:30:58,199 --> 0:31:0,3
WAS INTERESTED IN JOINING MY RESEARCH GROUP,


786
0:31:0,3 --> 0:31:2,3
AND WE TALKED ABOUT IT, AND HE SAID,


787
0:31:2,3 --> 0:31:4,534
"OH, AND I HAVE A CHILDHOOD DREAM."


788
0:31:4,534 --> 0:31:7,701
IT GETS PRETTY EASY TO RECOGNIZE THEM WHEN THEY TELL YOU.


789
0:31:7,701 --> 0:31:10,133
AND I SAID, "YES, TOMMY, WHAT IS YOUR CHILDHOOD DREAM?"


790
0:31:10,133 --> 0:31:14,833
HE SAID, "I WANT TO WORK ON THE NEXT "STAR WARS" FILM."


791
0:31:14,833 --> 0:31:16,933
NOW, YOU GOT TO REMEMBER THE TIMING ON THIS.


792
0:31:16,933 --> 0:31:18,4
WHERE IS TOMMY? TOMMY IS HERE TODAY.


793
0:31:18,4 --> 0:31:20,734
WHAT YEAR WOULD THIS HAVE BEEN? YOUR SOPHOMORE YEAR.


794
0:31:20,734 --> 0:31:21,734
woman: RIGHT THERE.


795
0:31:21,734 --> 0:31:23,133
man: IT WAS AROUND 1993.


796
0:31:23,133 --> 0:31:25,433
Pausch: ARE YOU BREAKING ANYTHING BACK THERE, YOUNG MAN?


797
0:31:25,433 --> 0:31:27,4
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, SO IN 1993.


798
0:31:27,4 --> 0:31:29,6
AND I SAID TO TOMMY, "YOU KNOW


799
0:31:29,6 --> 0:31:33,67
THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO MAKE THOSE NEXT MOVIES."


800
0:31:33,67 --> 0:31:38,32
[laughter]


801
0:31:38,32 --> 0:31:41,666
AND HE SAID, "NO, THEY ARE."


802
0:31:41,666 --> 0:31:45,868
[laughter]


803
0:31:45,868 --> 0:31:48,933
AND TOMMY WORKED WITH ME FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS


804
0:31:48,933 --> 0:31:50,766
AS AN UNDERGRADUATE AND THEN AS A STAFF MEMBER,


805
0:31:50,766 --> 0:31:52,534
AND THEN WHEN I MOVED TO CARNEGIE MELLON,


806
0:31:52,534 --> 0:31:54,534
EVERY SINGLE MEMBER OF MY TEAM


807
0:31:54,534 --> 0:31:57,266
CAME FROM VIRGINIA TO CARNEGIE MELLON


808
0:31:57,266 --> 0:32:0,901
EXCEPT FOR TOMMY, BECAUSE HE GOT A BETTER OFFER,


809
0:32:0,901 --> 0:32:3,534
AND HE DID, INDEED, WORK ON ALL


810
0:32:3,534 --> 0:32:7,99
THREE OF THOSE FILMS.


811
0:32:7,99 --> 0:32:8,534
AND THEN I SAID, "WELL, THAT'S NICE,


812
0:32:8,534 --> 0:32:11,666
BUT, YOU KNOW, ONE AT A TIME IS KIND OF INEFFICIENT."


813
0:32:11,666 --> 0:32:14,333
AND PEOPLE WHO KNOW ME KNOW THAT I'M AN EFFICIENCY FREAK.


814
0:32:14,333 --> 0:32:16,534
SO I SAID, "CAN I DO THIS EN MASSE?


815
0:32:16,534 --> 0:32:19,199
CAN I GET PEOPLE TURNED IN SUCH A WAY


816
0:32:19,199 --> 0:32:21,734
THAT THEY CAN BE TURNED ON TO THEIR CHILDHOOD DREAMS?"


817
0:32:21,734 --> 0:32:23,666
AND I CREATED A COURSE, I CAME TO CARNEGIE MELLON,


818
0:32:23,666 --> 0:32:25,868
AND I CREATED A COURSE CALLED "BUILDING VIRTUAL WORLDS."


819
0:32:25,868 --> 0:32:27,3
IT'S A VERY SIMPLE COURSE.


820
0:32:27,3 --> 0:32:30,266
HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE HAVE EVER BEEN TO ANY OF THE SHOWS?


821
0:32:30,266 --> 0:32:31,734
OKAY, SO SOME OF YOU HAVE AN IDEA.


822
0:32:31,734 --> 0:32:33,801
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T, THE COURSE IS VERY SIMPLE.


823
0:32:33,801 --> 0:32:35,133
THERE ARE 50 STUDENTS DRAWN


824
0:32:35,133 --> 0:32:37,467
FROM ALL THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY.


825
0:32:37,467 --> 0:32:39,833
THERE ARE RANDOMLY CHOSEN--


826
0:32:39,833 --> 0:32:43,199
RANDOMLY CHOSEN TEAMS, FOUR PEOPLE PER TEAM,


827
0:32:43,199 --> 0:32:44,766
AND THEY CHANGE EVERY PROJECT.


828
0:32:44,766 --> 0:32:47,433
A PROJECT ONLY LASTS TWO WEEKS, SO YOU DO SOMETHING,


829
0:32:47,433 --> 0:32:49,634
YOU MAKE SOMETHING, YOU SHOW SOMETHING,


830
0:32:49,634 --> 0:32:52,67
THEN I SHUFFLE THE TEAMS, YOU GET THREE NEW PLAYMATES,


831
0:32:52,67 --> 0:32:55,467
AND YOU DO IT AGAIN, AND IT'S EVERY TWO WEEKS,


832
0:32:55,467 --> 0:32:58,833
AND SO YOU DO FIVE PROJECTS DURING THE SEMESTER.


833
0:32:58,833 --> 0:33:0,6
THE FIRST YEAR WE TAUGHT THIS COURSE,


834
0:33:0,6 --> 0:33:3,0
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE


835
0:33:3,0 --> 0:33:6,133
HOW MUCH OF A TIGER BY THE TAIL WE HAD.


836
0:33:6,133 --> 0:33:7,4
I WAS JUST RUNNING THE COURSE


837
0:33:7,4 --> 0:33:9,166
BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE IF WE COULD DO IT.


838
0:33:9,166 --> 0:33:11,6
WE HAD JUST LEARNED HOW TO DO TEXTURE MAPPING ON 3D GRAPHICS,


839
0:33:11,6 --> 0:33:13,5
AND WE COULD MAKE STUFF THAT LOOKED HALF DECENT.


840
0:33:13,5 --> 0:33:14,734
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE WERE RUNNING


841
0:33:14,734 --> 0:33:17,933
ON REALLY WEAK COMPUTERS BY CURRENT STANDARDS.


842
0:33:17,933 --> 0:33:19,3
BUT I SAID, "I'LL GIVE IT A TRY."


843
0:33:19,3 --> 0:33:21,467
AND AT MY NEW UNIVERSITY, I MADE A COUPLE OF PHONE CALLS,


844
0:33:21,467 --> 0:33:23,234
AND I SAID, "I WANT TO CROSS-LIST THIS COURSE


845
0:33:23,234 --> 0:33:25,234
TO GET ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE," AND WITHIN 24 HOURS,


846
0:33:25,234 --> 0:33:27,901
IT WAS CROSS-LISTED IN FIVE DEPARTMENTS.


847
0:33:27,901 --> 0:33:29,5
I LOVE THIS UNIVERSITY.


848
0:33:29,5 --> 0:33:32,67
I MEAN, IT'S JUST-- IT'S THE MOST AMAZING PLACE.


849
0:33:32,67 --> 0:33:34,99
AND THE KIDS SAID, "WELL, WHAT CONTENT DO WE MAKE?"


850
0:33:34,99 --> 0:33:36,0
I SAID, "HELL, I DON'T KNOW.


851
0:33:36,0 --> 0:33:37,333
"YOU MAKE WHATEVER YOU WANT.


852
0:33:37,333 --> 0:33:41,366
TWO RULES: NO SHOOTING VIOLENCE AND NO PORNOGRAPHY."


853
0:33:41,366 --> 0:33:43,868
NOT BECAUSE I'M OPPOSED TO THOSE IN PARTICULAR,


854
0:33:43,868 --> 0:33:48,968
BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S BEEN DONE WITH VR, RIGHT?


855
0:33:48,968 --> 0:33:50,968
AND YOU'D BE AMAZED HOW MANY 19-YEAR-OLD BOYS


856
0:33:50,968 --> 0:33:54,534
ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF IDEAS WHEN YOU TAKE THOSE OFF THE TABLE.


857
0:33:54,534 --> 0:33:59,666
[laughter]


858
0:33:59,666 --> 0:34:1,933
ANYWAY, SO I TAUGHT THE COURSE.


859
0:34:1,933 --> 0:34:4,199
THE FIRST ASSIGNMENT, I GAVE IT TO THEM,


860
0:34:4,199 --> 0:34:8,199
THEY CAME BACK IN TWO WEEKS, AND THEY JUST BLEW ME AWAY.


861
0:34:8,199 --> 0:34:12,66
I MEAN, THE WORK WAS SO BEYOND, LITERALLY, MY IMAGINATION,


862
0:34:12,66 --> 0:34:14,733
BECAUSE I HAD COPIED THE PROCESS FROM IMAGINEERING'S VR LAB,


863
0:34:14,733 --> 0:34:16,233
BUT I HAD NO IDEA


864
0:34:16,233 --> 0:34:19,366
WHAT THEY COULD OR COULDN'T DO WITH IT AS UNDERGRADUATES,


865
0:34:19,366 --> 0:34:20,601
AND THEIR TOOLS WERE WEAKER,


866
0:34:20,601 --> 0:34:22,3
AND THEY CAME BACK ON THE FIRST ASSIGNMENT,


867
0:34:22,3 --> 0:34:24,166
AND THEY DID SOMETHING THAT WAS SO SPECTACULAR


868
0:34:24,166 --> 0:34:26,3
THAT I LITERALLY DIDN'T-- TEN YEARS AS A PROFESSOR,


869
0:34:26,3 --> 0:34:28,66
AND I HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO DO NEXT.


870
0:34:28,66 --> 0:34:29,801
SO I CALLED UP MY MENTOR.


871
0:34:29,801 --> 0:34:33,3
I CALLED UP ANDY VAN DAM, AND I SAID,


872
0:34:33,3 --> 0:34:35,133
"ANDY, I JUST GAVE A TWO-WEEK ASSIGNMENT,


873
0:34:35,133 --> 0:34:36,467
"AND THEY CAME BACK AND DID STUFF


874
0:34:36,467 --> 0:34:38,133
"THAT IF I HAD GIVEN THEM A WHOLE SEMESTER,


875
0:34:38,133 --> 0:34:39,601
"I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THEM ALL "A"s.


876
0:34:39,601 --> 0:34:43,7
SENSEI, WHAT DO I DO?"


877
0:34:43,7 --> 0:34:47,601
AND ANDY THOUGHT FOR A MINUTE, AND HE SAID,


878
0:34:47,601 --> 0:34:49,666
"YOU GO BACK INTO CLASS TOMORROW,


879
0:34:49,666 --> 0:34:51,566
"AND YOU LOOK THEM IN THE EYE, AND YOU SAY,


880
0:34:51,566 --> 0:34:54,634
'GUYS, THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD, BUT I KNOW YOU CAN DO BETTER.'"


881
0:34:54,634 --> 0:34:58,733
[laughter]


882
0:34:58,733 --> 0:35:0,267
AND THAT WAS EXACTLY THE RIGHT ADVICE,


883
0:35:0,267 --> 0:35:1,666
BECAUSE WHAT HE SAID WAS,


884
0:35:1,666 --> 0:35:5,66
"YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T KNOW WHERE THE BAR SHOULD BE,


885
0:35:5,66 --> 0:35:7,3
"AND YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO DO THEM A DISSERVICE


886
0:35:7,3 --> 0:35:10,66
BY PUTTING IT ANYWHERE."


887
0:35:10,66 --> 0:35:12,199
AND, BOY, WAS THAT GOOD ADVICE,


888
0:35:12,199 --> 0:35:16,366
BECAUSE THEY JUST KEPT GOING, AND DURING THAT SEMESTER,


889
0:35:16,366 --> 0:35:18,601
IT BECAME THIS UNDERGROUND THING.


890
0:35:18,601 --> 0:35:21,467
I'D WALK INTO A CLASS WITH 50 STUDENTS IN IT,


891
0:35:21,467 --> 0:35:25,968
AND THERE WERE 95 PEOPLE IN THE ROOM,


892
0:35:25,968 --> 0:35:27,934
BECAUSE IT WAS THE DAY WE WERE SHOWING WORK,


893
0:35:27,934 --> 0:35:31,601
AND PEOPLE'S ROOMMATES AND FRIENDS AND PARENTS--


894
0:35:31,601 --> 0:35:34,9
I'D NEVER HAD PARENTS COME TO CLASS BEFORE.


895
0:35:34,9 --> 0:35:37,5
IT WAS FLATTERING AND SOMEWHAT SCARY.


896
0:35:37,5 --> 0:35:40,3
AND SO IT SNOWBALLED, AND WE HAD THIS BIZARRE THING OF,


897
0:35:40,3 --> 0:35:41,733
"WELL, WE'VE GOT TO SHARE THIS."


898
0:35:41,733 --> 0:35:43,434
IF THERE'S ANYTHING I'VE BEEN RAISED TO DO,


899
0:35:43,434 --> 0:35:44,801
IT'S TO SHARE, AND I SAID,


900
0:35:44,801 --> 0:35:46,733
"WE'VE GOT TO SHOW THIS AT THE END OF THE SEMESTER.


901
0:35:46,733 --> 0:35:47,833
WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A BIG SHOW."


902
0:35:47,833 --> 0:35:49,166
AND WE BOOKED THIS ROOM, MCCONOMY.


903
0:35:49,166 --> 0:35:50,767
I HAVE A LOT OF GOOD MEMORIES IN THIS ROOM.


904
0:35:50,767 --> 0:35:52,934
AND WE BOOKED IT NOT BECAUSE WE THOUGHT WE COULD FILL IT,


905
0:35:52,934 --> 0:35:55,733
BUT BECAUSE IT HAD THE ONLY A/V SETUP THAT WOULD WORK,


906
0:35:55,733 --> 0:36:0,1
BECAUSE THIS WAS A ZOO, COMPUTERS AND EVERYTHING.


907
0:36:0,1 --> 0:36:2,934
AND THEN WE FILLED IT, AND WE MORE THAN FILLED IT.


908
0:36:2,934 --> 0:36:4,5
WE HAD PEOPLE STANDING IN THE AISLE.


909
0:36:4,5 --> 0:36:7,133
I WILL NEVER FORGET THE DEAN AT THE TIME, JIM MORRIS,


910
0:36:7,133 --> 0:36:9,801
WAS SITTING ON THE STAGE RIGHT ABOUT THERE.


911
0:36:9,801 --> 0:36:12,968
WE HAD TO KIND OF SCOOT HIM OUT OF THE WAY.


912
0:36:12,968 --> 0:36:15,267
AND THE ENERGY IN THE ROOM WAS LIKE NOTHING


913
0:36:15,267 --> 0:36:17,533
I HAD EVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE, AND PRESIDENT COHON,


914
0:36:17,533 --> 0:36:21,233
JERRY COHON WAS THERE, AND HE SENSED THE SAME THING.


915
0:36:21,233 --> 0:36:22,566
HE LATER DESCRIBED IT AS LIKE


916
0:36:22,566 --> 0:36:27,833
AN OHIO STATE FOOTBALL PEP RALLY EXCEPT FOR ACADEMICS,


917
0:36:27,833 --> 0:36:30,32
AND HE CAME OVER, AND HE ASKED EXACTLY THE RIGHT QUESTION.


918
0:36:30,32 --> 0:36:31,366
HE SAID, "BEFORE YOU START,"


919
0:36:31,366 --> 0:36:34,1
HE SAID, "I GOT TO KNOW, WHERE ARE THESE PEOPLE FROM?"


920
0:36:34,1 --> 0:36:36,399
HE SAID, "THE AUDIENCE, WHAT DEPARTMENTS ARE THEY FROM?"


921
0:36:36,399 --> 0:36:38,7
AND WE POLLED THEM, AND IT WAS ALL THE DEPARTMENTS,


922
0:36:38,7 --> 0:36:39,833
AND I FELT VERY GOOD,


923
0:36:39,833 --> 0:36:41,533
BECAUSE I HAD JUST COME TO CAMPUS.


924
0:36:41,533 --> 0:36:43,1
HE HAD JUST COME TO CAMPUS,


925
0:36:43,1 --> 0:36:46,566
AND MY NEW BOSS HAD SEEN IN A VERY CORPORAL WAY


926
0:36:46,566 --> 0:36:50,533
THAT THIS IS THE UNIVERSITY THAT PUTS EVERYBODY TOGETHER,


927
0:36:50,533 --> 0:36:53,801
AND THAT MADE ME FEEL JUST TREMENDOUS.


928
0:36:53,801 --> 0:36:55,366
SO WE DID THIS CAMPUS-WIDE EXHIBITION.


929
0:36:55,366 --> 0:36:56,801
PEOPLE PERFORMED DOWN HERE.


930
0:36:56,801 --> 0:36:59,366
THEY'RE IN COSTUME, AND WE PROJECT JUST LIKE THIS,


931
0:36:59,366 --> 0:37:0,934
AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.


932
0:37:0,934 --> 0:37:2,399
YOU CAN SEE WHAT THEY'RE SEEING


933
0:37:2,399 --> 0:37:3,399
IN THE HEAD MOUNT.


934
0:37:3,399 --> 0:37:4,733
THERE'S A LOT OF BIG PROPS.


935
0:37:4,733 --> 0:37:8,199
SO THERE'S A GUY WHITE WATER RAFTING.


936
0:37:8,199 --> 0:37:13,399
THIS IS BEN IN "E.T."


937
0:37:13,399 --> 0:37:15,1
AND YES, I DID TELL THEM IF THEY DIDN'T DO


938
0:37:15,1 --> 0:37:16,833
THE SHOT OF THE KIDS BIKING ACROSS THE MOON,


939
0:37:16,833 --> 0:37:17,833
I WOULD FAIL HIM.


940
0:37:17,833 --> 0:37:19,399
THAT IS A TRUE STORY.


941
0:37:19,399 --> 0:37:21,5
AND I THOUGHT I'D SHOW YOU JUST--


942
0:37:21,5 --> 0:37:25,3
[laughter]


943
0:37:25,3 --> 0:37:26,867
SO I THOUGHT I'D SHOW YOU JUST ONE WORLD,


944
0:37:26,867 --> 0:37:29,934
AND IF WE CAN GET THE LIGHTS DOWN IF THAT'S AT ALL POSSIBLE.


945
0:37:29,934 --> 0:37:31,199
NO, OKAY, THAT MEANS NO.


946
0:37:31,199 --> 0:37:32,399
ALL RIGHT.


947
0:37:32,399 --> 0:37:37,733
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL JUST DO OUR BEST THEN.


948
0:37:37,733 --> 0:37:38,801
rabbit: OH, HELLO THERE.

950
0:37:39,968 --> 0:37:41,199
I'M LONELY.


951
0:37:41,199 --> 0:37:44,267
MAKE ME A WORLD.

953
0:37:45,333 --> 0:37:49,801

0:38:4,733 --> 0:38:6,399
[giggles]


959
0:38:6,399 --> 0:38:9,7
MAKE ME SOME TREES.


960

961
0:38:10,7 --> 0:38:14,634

YAY!


963
0:38:18,133 --> 0:38:21,801
YAY!


964
0:38:21,801 --> 0:38:25,7
OOH, THAT'S NICE.

0:38:34,666 --> 0:38:35,666

Pausch: NOW, THEY'RE GONNA TURN THIS ON ITS HEAD.


990
0:39:13,934 --> 0:39:15,566
WATCH CLOSELY.


991
0:39:15,566 --> 0:39:17,467
THE WORLD DOESN'T WANT TO GO ON


992
0:39:17,467 --> 0:39:19,3
TO THE NEXT THING IN THE SHOW.


993
0:39:19,3 --> 0:39:28,634
SO SHE'S READY TO MOVE ON, AND IT'S NOT.


994
0:39:28,634 --> 0:39:30,833
rabbit: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?


995
0:39:30,833 --> 0:39:32,934
YOU CAN'T END THIS NOW.


996
0:39:32,934 --> 0:39:35,7
woman: BUT THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER WORLDS THAT HAVE TO GO.


997
0:39:35,7 --> 0:39:38,934
rabbit: BUT OUR WORLD IS THE BEST WORLD.


998
0:39:38,934 --> 0:39:40,3
HEY, HEY, HEY!

0:39:40,3 --> 0:39:41,634
HEY, NO!

woman: WE'RE GONNA SHUT YOU DOWN.


1004
0:39:50,467 --> 0:39:53,533
CONTROL, ALT, DELETE.


1005
0:39:53,533 --> 0:39:55,666

0:40:18,434 --> 0:40:21,0
rabbit: HE LEFT US.


1009
0:40:21,0 --> 0:40:23,199
HE LEFT US.

0:40:23,199 --> 0:40:27,533

1011
0:40:27,533 --> 0:40:29,0

MY SKIN.


1013
0:40:30,399 --> 0:40:33,399
MY SKIN!


1014
0:40:33,399 --> 0:40:39,434
[screaming and muffled gunshots]


1015
0:40:39,434 --> 0:40:57,801
[screaming]


1016
0:40:57,801 --> 0:40:59,934
WE LOVED YOU.


1017
0:40:59,934 --> 0:41:9,434
GOOD-BYE!


1018
0:41:9,434 --> 0:41:18,0
[laughter]


1019
0:41:18,0 --> 0:41:21,399
Pausch: IT WAS AN UNUSUAL COURSE


1020
0:41:21,399 --> 0:41:24,166
WITH SOME OF THE MOST BRILLIANT, CREATIVE STUDENTS


1021
0:41:24,166 --> 0:41:26,7
FROM ALL ACROSS THE CAMPUS.


1022
0:41:26,7 --> 0:41:29,267
IT JUST WAS A JOY TO BE INVOLVED.


1023
0:41:29,267 --> 0:41:31,601
AND THEY TOOK THE WHOLE STAGE PERFORMANCE ASPECT OF THIS


1024
0:41:31,601 --> 0:41:33,133
WAY TOO SERIOUSLY.


1025
0:41:33,133 --> 0:41:36,333
[laughter]


1026
0:41:36,333 --> 0:41:39,233
AND IT BECAME THIS CAMPUS PHENOMENON EVERY YEAR.


1027
0:41:39,233 --> 0:41:41,399
PEOPLE WOULD LINE UP FOR IT.


1028
0:41:41,399 --> 0:41:43,333
IT WAS VERY FLATTERING,


1029
0:41:43,333 --> 0:41:47,66
AND IT GAVE KIDS A SENSE OF EXCITEMENT


1030
0:41:47,66 --> 0:41:50,7
OF PUTTING ON A SHOW FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE THEN EXCITED ABOUT IT,


1031
0:41:50,7 --> 0:41:52,467
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE BEST THINGS


1032
0:41:52,467 --> 0:41:53,767
YOU CAN GIVE SOMEBODY,


1033
0:41:53,767 --> 0:41:56,333
THE CHANCE TO SHOW THEM WHAT IT FEELS LIKE


1034
0:41:56,333 --> 0:41:58,634
TO MAKE OTHER PEOPLE GET EXCITED AND HAPPY.


1035
0:41:58,634 --> 0:42:0,366
I MEAN, THAT'S A TREMENDOUS GIFT.


1036
0:42:0,366 --> 0:42:2,233
WE ALWAYS TRIED TO INVOLVE THE AUDIENCE,


1037
0:42:2,233 --> 0:42:3,767
WHETHER IT WAS PEOPLE WITH GLOW STICKS


1038
0:42:3,767 --> 0:42:7,133
OR BATTING A BEACH BALL AROUND OR DRIVING.


1039
0:42:7,133 --> 0:42:8,166
THIS IS REALLY COOL.


1040
0:42:8,166 --> 0:42:9,601
THIS TECHNOLOGY ACTUALLY GOT USED


1041
0:42:9,601 --> 0:42:11,566
AT THE "SPIDERMAN 3" PREMIERE IN L.A.


1042
0:42:11,566 --> 0:42:13,833
SO THE AUDIENCE WAS CONTROLLING SOMETHING ON THE SCREEN,


1043
0:42:13,833 --> 0:42:16,5
SO THAT'S KIND OF NICE.


1044
0:42:16,5 --> 0:42:18,9
AND I DON'T HAVE A CLASS PICTURE FROM EVERY YEAR,


1045
0:42:18,9 --> 0:42:20,666
BUT I DREDGED ALL THE ONES THAT I DO HAVE,


1046
0:42:20,666 --> 0:42:22,968
AND ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT WHAT A PRIVILEGE


1047
0:42:22,968 --> 0:42:24,7
AND AN HONOR IT WAS TO TEACH THAT COURSE


1048
0:42:24,7 --> 0:42:26,533
FOR SOMETHING LIKE TEN YEARS,


1049
0:42:26,533 --> 0:42:30,733
AND ALL GOOD THINGS COME TO AN END,


1050
0:42:30,733 --> 0:42:34,566
AND I STOPPED TEACHING THAT COURSE ABOUT A YEAR AGO.


1051
0:42:34,566 --> 0:42:36,5
PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME WHAT WAS MY FAVORITE MOMENT.


1052
0:42:36,5 --> 0:42:38,867
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU COULD HAVE A FAVORITE MOMENT,


1053
0:42:38,867 --> 0:42:41,767
BUT, BOY, THERE IS ONE I'LL NEVER FORGET.


1054
0:42:41,767 --> 0:42:46,233
THIS WAS A WORLD WITH, I BELIEVE A ROLLER-SKATING NINJA,


1055
0:42:46,233 --> 0:42:48,5
AND ONE OF THE RULES WAS THAT WE PERFORM THESE THINGS LIVE,


1056
0:42:48,5 --> 0:42:49,801
AND THEY ALL HAD TO REALLY WORK,


1057
0:42:49,801 --> 0:42:51,199
AND THE MOMENT IT STOPPED WORKING,


1058
0:42:51,199 --> 0:42:52,733
WE WENT TO YOUR BACKUP VIDEOTAPE,


1059
0:42:52,733 --> 0:42:54,9
AND THIS WAS VERY EMBARRASSING.


1060
0:42:54,9 --> 0:42:56,767
SO WE HAVE THIS NINJA ON STAGE,


1061
0:42:56,767 --> 0:42:58,467
AND HE'S DOING THIS ROLLER-SKATING THING,


1062
0:42:58,467 --> 0:43:0,833
AND THE WORLD, IT DID NOT CRASH GENTLY.


1063
0:43:0,833 --> 0:43:2,199
WHOOSH.


1064
0:43:2,199 --> 0:43:3,533
AND I COME OUT,


1065
0:43:3,533 --> 0:43:5,399
AND I BELIEVE IT WAS STEVE AUDIA, WASN'T IT?


1066
0:43:5,399 --> 0:43:7,199
WHERE IS HE?


1067
0:43:7,199 --> 0:43:8,601
OKAY, WHERE IS STEVE?


1068
0:43:8,601 --> 0:43:10,199
AH, MY MAN, STEVE AUDIA.


1069
0:43:10,199 --> 0:43:13,467
AND TALK ABOUT QUICK ON YOUR FEET, ALL RIGHT?


1070
0:43:13,467 --> 0:43:16,267
I SAY, "STEVE, I'M SORRY, BUT YOUR WORLD HAS CRASHED,


1071
0:43:16,267 --> 0:43:19,0
AND WE'RE GOING TO GO TO VIDEOTAPE."


1072
0:43:19,0 --> 0:43:22,366
AND HE PULLS OUT HIS NINJA SWORD AND SAYS,


1073
0:43:22,366 --> 0:43:23,733
"I AM DISHONORED! WHA!"


1074
0:43:23,733 --> 0:43:25,267
AND JUST DROPS.


1075
0:43:25,267 --> 0:43:35,733
[laughter and applause]


1076
0:43:35,733 --> 0:43:37,1
AND SO I THINK IT'S VERY TELLING


1077
0:43:37,1 --> 0:43:38,267
THAT MY FAVORITE MOMENT


1078
0:43:38,267 --> 0:43:40,66
IN TEN YEARS OF THIS HIGH-TECHNOLOGY COURSE


1079
0:43:40,66 --> 0:43:42,199
WAS A BRILLIANT AD-LIB.


1080
0:43:42,199 --> 0:43:44,833
AND THEN WHEN THE VIDEOTAPE IS DONE AND THE LIGHTS COME UP,


1081
0:43:44,833 --> 0:43:49,533
HE'S LYING THERE LIFELESS, AND HIS TEAMMATES DRAG HIM OFF.


1082
0:43:49,533 --> 0:43:54,467
IT WAS REALLY A FANTASTIC MOMENT.


1083
0:43:54,467 --> 0:43:56,634
AND THE COURSE WAS ALL ABOUT BONDING.


1084
0:43:56,634 --> 0:43:57,833
PEOPLE USED TO SAY, YOU KNOW,


1085
0:43:57,833 --> 0:43:59,399
"WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE FOR A GOOD WORLD?"


1086
0:43:59,399 --> 0:44:0,968
I SAID, "I CAN'T TELL YOU BEFOREHAND,


1087
0:44:0,968 --> 0:44:2,399
"BUT RIGHT BEFORE THEY PRESENT IT,


1088
0:44:2,399 --> 0:44:3,733
"I CAN TELL YOU IF THE WORLD'S GOOD


1089
0:44:3,733 --> 0:44:5,0
"JUST BY THE BODY LANGUAGE.


1090
0:44:5,0 --> 0:44:6,666
"IF THEY'RE STANDING CLOSE TO EACH OTHER,


1091
0:44:6,666 --> 0:44:8,968
THE WORLD IS GOOD."


1092
0:44:8,968 --> 0:44:16,801
AND BVW WAS A PIONEERING COURSE.


1093
0:44:16,801 --> 0:44:19,333
I WON'T BORE YOU WITH ALL THE DETAILS,


1094
0:44:19,333 --> 0:44:22,767
BUT IT WASN'T EASY TO DO,


1095
0:44:22,767 --> 0:44:25,634
AND I WAS GIVEN THIS WHEN I STEPPED DOWN FROM THE ETC,


1096
0:44:25,634 --> 0:44:27,233
AND I THINK IT'S EMBLEMATIC.


1097
0:44:27,233 --> 0:44:29,166
IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO ANYTHING THAT'S PIONEERING,


1098
0:44:29,166 --> 0:44:30,833
YOU WILL GET THOSE ARROWS IN THE BACK,


1099
0:44:30,833 --> 0:44:32,199
AND YOU JUST HAVE TO PUT UP WITH IT.


1100
0:44:32,199 --> 0:44:34,233
I MEAN, EVERYTHING THAT COULD GO WRONG DID GO WRONG,


1101
0:44:34,233 --> 0:44:35,833
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,


1102
0:44:35,833 --> 0:44:40,32
A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE HAD A WHOLE LOT OF FUN.


1103
0:44:40,32 --> 0:44:41,434
WHEN YOU'VE HAD SOMETHING FOR


1104
0:44:41,434 --> 0:44:44,133
TEN YEARS THAT YOU HOLD SO PRECIOUS,


1105
0:44:44,133 --> 0:44:45,566
IT'S THE TOUGHEST THING IN THE WORLD


1106
0:44:45,566 --> 0:44:47,434
TO HAND IT OVER,


1107
0:44:47,434 --> 0:44:48,867
AND THE ONLY ADVICE I CAN GIVE YOU IS,


1108
0:44:48,867 --> 0:44:52,66
FIND SOMEBODY BETTER THAN YOU TO HAND IT TO,


1109
0:44:52,66 --> 0:44:53,434
AND THAT'S WHAT I DID.


1110
0:44:53,434 --> 0:44:57,833
THERE WAS THIS KID AT THE VR STUDIO WAY BACK WHEN,


1111
0:44:57,833 --> 0:44:59,333
AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO SPEND VERY LONG


1112
0:44:59,333 --> 0:45:1,801
IN JESSE SCHELL'S ORBIT TO GO,


1113
0:45:1,801 --> 0:45:4,934
"THE FORCE IS STRONG IN THIS ONE."


1114
0:45:4,934 --> 0:45:6,666
AND ONE OF MY GREATEST--


1115
0:45:6,666 --> 0:45:9,1
MY TWO GREATEST ACCOMPLISHMENTS, I THINK, FOR CARNEGIE MELLON


1116
0:45:9,1 --> 0:45:10,934
WERE THAT I GOT JESSICA HODGINS AND JESSE SCHELL


1117
0:45:10,934 --> 0:45:12,333
TO COME HERE AND JOIN OUR FACULTY,


1118
0:45:12,333 --> 0:45:14,5
AND I WAS THRILLED WHEN I COULD HAND THIS OVER TO JESSE,


1119
0:45:14,5 --> 0:45:16,133
AND TO NO ONE'S SURPRISE,


1120
0:45:16,133 --> 0:45:18,233
HE HAS REALLY TAKEN IT UP TO THE NEXT NOTCH,


1121
0:45:18,233 --> 0:45:21,5
AND THE COURSE IS IN MORE-THAN-GOOD HANDS.


1122
0:45:21,5 --> 0:45:24,366
IT'S IN BETTER HANDS.


1123
0:45:24,366 --> 0:45:26,601
BUT IT WAS JUST ONE COURSE,


1124
0:45:26,601 --> 0:45:29,166
AND THEN WE REALLY TOOK IT UP A NOTCH,


1125
0:45:29,166 --> 0:45:34,199
AND WE CREATED WHAT I WOULD CALL THE DREAM FULFILLMENT FACTORY.


1126
0:45:34,199 --> 0:45:36,833
DON MARINELLI AND I GOT TOGETHER,


1127
0:45:36,833 --> 0:45:39,634
AND WITH THE UNIVERSITY'S BLESSING AND ENCOURAGEMENT,


1128
0:45:39,634 --> 0:45:42,1
WE MADE THIS THING OUT OF WHOLE CLOTH


1129
0:45:42,1 --> 0:45:43,833
THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY INSANE,


1130
0:45:43,833 --> 0:45:45,9
SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN TRIED.


1131
0:45:45,9 --> 0:45:50,801
ALL THE SANE UNIVERSITIES DIDN'T GO NEAR THIS KIND OF STUFF,


1132
0:45:50,801 --> 0:45:55,366
CREATING A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNISTIC VOID.


1133
0:45:55,366 --> 0:45:57,0
SO THE ENTERTAINMENT TECHNOLOGY CENTER


1134
0:45:57,0 --> 0:45:58,601
WAS ALL ABOUT ARTISTS AND TECHNOLOGISTS


1135
0:45:58,601 --> 0:46:0,833
WORKING IN SMALL TEAMS TO MAKE THINGS.


1136
0:46:0,833 --> 0:46:3,199
IT WAS A TWO-YEAR PROFESSIONAL MASTER'S DEGREE,


1137
0:46:3,199 --> 0:46:6,1
AND DON AND I WERE TWO KINDRED SPIRITS.


1138
0:46:6,1 --> 0:46:7,233
WE'RE VERY DIFFERENT.


1139
0:46:7,233 --> 0:46:8,267
ANYBODY WHO KNOWS US KNOWS


1140
0:46:8,267 --> 0:46:11,267
THAT WE ARE VERY DIFFERENT PEOPLE,


1141
0:46:11,267 --> 0:46:13,366
AND WE LIKED TO DO THINGS IN A NEW WAY,


1142
0:46:13,366 --> 0:46:14,733
AND THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS


1143
0:46:14,733 --> 0:46:17,32
THAT WE ARE BOTH A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE IN ACADEMIA.


1144
0:46:17,32 --> 0:46:18,968
I USED TO SAY THAT I AM UNCOMFORTABLE AS AN ACADEMIC


1145
0:46:18,968 --> 0:46:20,5
BECAUSE I COME FROM A LONG LINE OF PEOPLE


1146
0:46:20,5 --> 0:46:25,634
WHO ACTUALLY WORKED FOR A LIVING, SO...


1147
0:46:25,634 --> 0:46:27,833
[laughter]


1148
0:46:27,833 --> 0:46:31,434
I DETECT NERVOUS LAUGHTER.


1149
0:46:31,434 --> 0:46:32,968
AND I WANT TO STRESS, CARNEGIE MELLON


1150
0:46:32,968 --> 0:46:34,233
IS THE ONLY PLACE IN THE WORLD


1151
0:46:34,233 --> 0:46:35,867
THAT THE ETC COULD HAVE HAPPENED,


1152
0:46:35,867 --> 0:46:41,366
BY FAR THE ONLY PLACE.


1153
0:46:41,366 --> 0:46:46,366
OKAY, THIS PICTURE WAS DON'S IDEA, OKAY?


1154
0:46:46,366 --> 0:46:47,867
AND WE LIKE TO REFER TO THIS PICTURE


1155
0:46:47,867 --> 0:46:54,32
AS DON MARINELLI ON GUITAR AND RANDY PAUSCH ON KEYBOARDS.


1156
0:46:54,32 --> 0:46:56,1
BUT WE REALLY DID PLAY UP THE LEFT BRAIN, RIGHT BRAIN,


1157
0:46:56,1 --> 0:46:57,867
AND IT WORKED OUT REALLY WELL THAT WAY.


1158
0:46:57,867 --> 0:47:1,467
DON IS AN INTENSE GUY.


1159
0:47:1,467 --> 0:47:7,566
[laughter and applause]


1160
0:47:7,566 --> 0:47:11,434
AND DON AND I SHARED AN OFFICE,


1161
0:47:11,434 --> 0:47:13,634
AND AT FIRST IT WAS A SMALL OFFICE.


1162
0:47:13,634 --> 0:47:18,66
WE SHARED AN OFFICE FOR SIX YEARS, ALL RIGHT?


1163
0:47:18,66 --> 0:47:21,801
NOW, THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW DON KNOW HE'S AN INTENSE GUY,


1164
0:47:21,801 --> 0:47:23,634
AND, YOU KNOW, GIVEN MY CURRENT CONDITION,


1165
0:47:23,634 --> 0:47:25,968
SOMEBODY WAS ASKING ME-- THIS IS A TERRIBLE JOKE,


1166
0:47:25,968 --> 0:47:28,634
BUT I'M GOING TO USE IT ANYWAY,


1167
0:47:28,634 --> 0:47:30,399
BECAUSE I KNOW DON WILL FORGIVE ME.


1168
0:47:30,399 --> 0:47:32,3
SOMEBODY SAID, "GIVEN YOUR CURRENT CONDITION,


1169
0:47:32,3 --> 0:47:33,566
"HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT


1170
0:47:33,566 --> 0:47:35,833
WHETHER YOU'RE GONNA GO TO HEAVEN OR HELL?"


1171
0:47:35,833 --> 0:47:37,833
AND I SAID, "I DON'T KNOW, BUT IF I'M GOING TO HELL,


1172
0:47:37,833 --> 0:47:41,733
I'M DUE SIX YEARS FOR TIME SERVED."


1173
0:47:41,733 --> 0:47:43,5
I KID.


1174
0:47:43,5 --> 0:47:45,66
SHARING AN OFFICE WITH DON


1175
0:47:45,66 --> 0:47:48,66
WAS REALLY LIKE SHARING AN OFFICE WITH A TORNADO.


1176
0:47:48,66 --> 0:47:49,366
THERE WAS JUST SO MUCH ENERGY,


1177
0:47:49,366 --> 0:47:53,66
AND YOU NEVER KNEW WHICH TRAILER WAS NEXT, RIGHT?


1178
0:47:53,66 --> 0:47:56,801
BUT YOU KNEW SOMETHING EXCITING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN,


1179
0:47:56,801 --> 0:47:59,133
AND THERE WAS SO MUCH ENERGY,


1180
0:47:59,133 --> 0:48:2,1
AND I DO BELIEVE IN GIVING CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE.


1181
0:48:2,1 --> 0:48:4,666
SO IN MY TYPICALLY VISUAL WAY,


1182
0:48:4,666 --> 0:48:7,5
IF DON AND I WERE TO SPLIT THE SUCCESS FOR THE ETC,


1183
0:48:7,5 --> 0:48:9,0
HE CLEARLY GETS THE LION'S SHARE OF IT.


1184
0:48:9,0 --> 0:48:11,166
HE DID THE LION'S SHARE OF THE WORK, OKAY.


1185
0:48:11,166 --> 0:48:12,9
HE HAD THE LION'S SHARE OF THE IDEAS.


1186
0:48:12,9 --> 0:48:14,32
IT WAS A GREAT TEAMWORK.


1187
0:48:14,32 --> 0:48:15,666
I THINK IT WAS A GREAT YIN AND A YANG,


1188
0:48:15,666 --> 0:48:19,233
BUT IT WAS MORE LIKE "YIN" AND YANG.


1189
0:48:19,233 --> 0:48:21,166
AND HE DESERVES THAT CREDIT, AND I GIVE IT TO HIM,


1190
0:48:21,166 --> 0:48:23,1
BECAUSE THE ETC IS A WONDERFUL PLACE,


1191
0:48:23,1 --> 0:48:26,1
AND HE'S NOW RUNNING IT, AND HE'S TAKING IT GLOBAL.


1192
0:48:26,1 --> 0:48:27,801
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A SECOND.


1193
0:48:27,801 --> 0:48:29,666
DESCRIBING THE ETC IS REALLY HARD,


1194
0:48:29,666 --> 0:48:31,333
AND I FINALLY FOUND A METAPHOR.


1195
0:48:31,333 --> 0:48:33,366
TELLING PEOPLE ABOUT THE ETC


1196
0:48:33,366 --> 0:48:35,66
IS LIKE DESCRIBING CIRQUE DU SOLEIL


1197
0:48:35,66 --> 0:48:36,399
IF THEY'VE NEVER SEEN IT.


1198
0:48:36,399 --> 0:48:38,333
SOONER OR LATER YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE THE MISTAKE.


1199
0:48:38,333 --> 0:48:39,7
YOU'RE GOING TO SAY, "WELL, IT'S LIKE A CIRCUS."


1200
0:48:39,7 --> 0:48:41,133
AND THEN YOU'RE DRAGGED INTO THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT,


1201
0:48:41,133 --> 0:48:42,601
"OH, HOW MANY TIGERS; HOW MANY LIONS;


1202
0:48:42,601 --> 0:48:44,801
ALL RIGHT, HOW MANY TRAPEZE ACTS?"


1203
0:48:44,801 --> 0:48:46,66
AND THAT MISSES THE WHOLE POINT.


1204
0:48:46,66 --> 0:48:47,634
SO WHEN WE SAY WE'RE A MASTER'S DEGREE,


1205
0:48:47,634 --> 0:48:48,867
WE'RE REALLY NOT LIKE


1206
0:48:48,867 --> 0:48:50,399
ANY MASTER'S DEGREE YOU'VE EVER SEEN.


1207
0:48:50,399 --> 0:48:58,133
HERE'S THE CURRICULUM.


1208
0:48:58,133 --> 0:48:59,934
THE CURRICULUM ENDED UP LOOKING LIKE THIS.


1209
0:48:59,934 --> 0:49:1,801
ALL I WANT TO DO IS VISUALLY COMMUNICATE TO YOU


1210
0:49:1,801 --> 0:49:3,968
THAT YOU DO FIVE PROJECTS IN BUILDING VIRTUAL WORLDS.


1211
0:49:3,968 --> 0:49:5,366
THEN YOU DO THREE MORE.


1212
0:49:5,366 --> 0:49:8,5
ALL OF YOUR TIME IS SPENT IN SMALL TEAMS MAKING STUFF,


1213
0:49:8,5 --> 0:49:9,9
NONE OF THAT BOOK-LEARNING THING.


1214
0:49:9,9 --> 0:49:12,32
DON AND I HAD NO PATIENCE FOR THE BOOK-LEARNING THING.


1215
0:49:12,32 --> 0:49:13,467
IT'S A MASTER'S DEGREE.


1216
0:49:13,467 --> 0:49:15,434
THEY ALREADY SPENT FOUR YEARS DOING BOOK LEARNING.


1217
0:49:15,434 --> 0:49:20,666
ALL RIGHT, BY NOW THEY SHOULD HAVE READ ALL THE BOOKS.


1218
0:49:20,666 --> 0:49:21,867
THE KEYS TO SUCCESS


1219
0:49:21,867 --> 0:49:25,634
WERE THAT CARNEGIE MELLON GAVE US THE REINS,


1220
0:49:25,634 --> 0:49:27,66
COMPLETELY GAVE US THE REINS.


1221
0:49:27,66 --> 0:49:28,5
WE HAD NO DEANS TO REPORT TO.


1222
0:49:28,5 --> 0:49:29,968
WE REPORTED DIRECTLY TO THE PROVOST,


1223
0:49:29,968 --> 0:49:31,434
WHICH IS GREAT, BECAUSE THE PROVOST


1224
0:49:31,434 --> 0:49:34,5
IS WAY TOO BUSY TO WATCH YOU CAREFULLY.


1225
0:49:34,5 --> 0:49:37,66
WE WERE GIVEN EXPLICIT LICENSE TO BREAK THE MOLD.


1226
0:49:37,66 --> 0:49:38,333
IT WAS ALL PROJECT BASED.


1227
0:49:38,333 --> 0:49:39,333
IT WAS INTENSE.


1228
0:49:39,333 --> 0:49:41,533
IT WAS FUN, AND WE TOOK FIELD TRIPS.


1229
0:49:41,533 --> 0:49:43,533
EVERY SPRING SEMESTER IN JANUARY,


1230
0:49:43,533 --> 0:49:45,7
WE'D TAKE ALL 50 STUDENTS IN THE FIRST-YEAR CLASS,


1231
0:49:45,7 --> 0:49:47,566
AND WE'D TAKE THEM OUT TO SHOPS AT PIXAR.


1232
0:49:47,566 --> 0:49:49,533
WE'D TAKE 'EM TO PIXAR, INDUSTRIAL LIGHT AND MAGIC,


1233
0:49:49,533 --> 0:49:50,9
AND OF COURSE WHEN YOU'VE GOT GUYS


1234
0:49:50,9 --> 0:49:53,801
LIKE TOMMY THERE ACTING AS HOST, RIGHT,


1235
0:49:53,801 --> 0:49:56,233
IT'S PRETTY EASY TO GET ENTREE TO THESE PLACES.


1236
0:49:56,233 --> 0:49:58,968
SO WE DID THINGS VERY, VERY DIFFERENTLY.


1237
0:49:58,968 --> 0:50:0,601
THE KIND OF PROJECTS STUDENTS WOULD DO,


1238
0:50:0,601 --> 0:50:3,467
WE DID A LOT OF WHAT WE'D CALL EDU-TAINMENT.


1239
0:50:3,467 --> 0:50:4,666
WE DEVELOPED A BUNCH OF THINGS


1240
0:50:4,666 --> 0:50:6,233
WITH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT OF NEW YORK,


1241
0:50:6,233 --> 0:50:8,166
A NETWORK SIMULATOR FOR TRAINING FIREFIGHTERS,


1242
0:50:8,166 --> 0:50:10,166
USING VIDEO GAME-ISH TYPE TECHNOLOGY


1243
0:50:10,166 --> 0:50:12,133
TO TEACH PEOPLE USEFUL THINGS.


1244
0:50:12,133 --> 0:50:14,333
THAT'S NOT BAD.


1245
0:50:14,333 --> 0:50:15,801
COMPANIES DID THIS STRANGE THING.


1246
0:50:15,801 --> 0:50:20,467
THEY PUT IN WRITING, "WE PROMISE TO HIRE YOUR STUDENTS."


1247
0:50:20,467 --> 0:50:22,166
I'VE GOT THE EA AND ACTIVISION ONES HERE.


1248
0:50:22,166 --> 0:50:25,233
I THINK THERE ARE NOW, HOW MANY, FIVE?


1249
0:50:25,233 --> 0:50:27,434
DREW KNOWS, I BET.


1250
0:50:27,434 --> 0:50:29,66
SO THERE ARE FIVE WRITTEN AGREEMENTS.


1251
0:50:29,66 --> 0:50:30,533
I DON'T KNOW OF ANY OTHER SCHOOL


1252
0:50:30,533 --> 0:50:32,733
THAT HAS THIS KIND OF WRITTEN AGREEMENT WITH ANY COMPANY,


1253
0:50:32,733 --> 0:50:34,267
AND SO THAT'S A REAL STATEMENT.


1254
0:50:34,267 --> 0:50:35,733
AND THESE ARE MULTIPLE-YEAR THINGS,


1255
0:50:35,733 --> 0:50:37,199
SO THEY'RE AGREEING TO HIRE PEOPLE


1256
0:50:37,199 --> 0:50:39,833
FOR SUMMER INTERNSHIPS THAT WE HAVE NOT ADMITTED YET.


1257
0:50:39,833 --> 0:50:41,199
THAT'S A PRETTY STRONG STATEMENT


1258
0:50:41,199 --> 0:50:43,166
ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE PROGRAM.


1259
0:50:43,166 --> 0:50:45,801
AND DON, AS I SAID, HE'S NOW-- HE'S CRAZY.


1260
0:50:45,801 --> 0:50:48,366
I MEAN THAT IN A WONDERFUL COMPLIMENTARY WAY.


1261
0:50:48,366 --> 0:50:52,199
HE'S DOING THESE THINGS WHERE I'M LIKE, "OH, MY GOD."


1262
0:50:52,199 --> 0:50:54,733
HE'S NOT HERE TONIGHT, BECAUSE HE'S IN SINGAPORE,


1263
0:50:54,733 --> 0:50:57,3
BECAUSE THERE'S GOING TO BE AN ETC CAMPUS IN SINGAPORE.


1264
0:50:57,3 --> 0:50:58,733
THERE'S ALREADY ONE IN AUSTRALIA,


1265
0:50:58,733 --> 0:51:0,166
AND THERE'S GOING TO BE ONE IN KOREA.


1266
0:51:0,166 --> 0:51:1,9
SO THIS IS BECOMING A GLOBAL PHENOMENON.


1267
0:51:1,9 --> 0:51:3,5
SO I THINK THIS REALLY SPEAKS VOLUMES


1268
0:51:3,5 --> 0:51:4,9
ABOUT ALL THE OTHER UNIVERSITIES.


1269
0:51:4,9 --> 0:51:6,467
IT'S REALLY TRUE THAT CARNEGIE MELLON


1270
0:51:6,467 --> 0:51:8,66
IS THE ONLY UNIVERSITY THAT CAN DO THIS.


1271
0:51:8,66 --> 0:51:12,434
WE JUST HAVE TO DO IT ALL OVER THE WORLD NOW.


1272
0:51:12,434 --> 0:51:14,133
ONE OTHER BIG SUCCESS ABOUT THE ETC


1273
0:51:14,133 --> 0:51:16,767
IS TEACHING PEOPLE ABOUT FOCUS--


1274
0:51:16,767 --> 0:51:21,366
OH, I HEAR THE NERVOUS LAUGHTER FROM THE STUDENTS.


1275
0:51:21,366 --> 0:51:23,366
I HAD FORGOTTEN THE DELAYED SHOCK THERAPY EFFECT


1276
0:51:23,366 --> 0:51:25,233
OF THESE BAR CHARTS.


1277
0:51:25,233 --> 0:51:27,166
WHEN YOU'RE TAKING BUILDING VIRTUAL WORLDS,


1278
0:51:27,166 --> 0:51:28,833
EVERY TWO WEEKS WE GET PEER FEEDBACK.


1279
0:51:28,833 --> 0:51:30,366
WE PUT THAT ALL INTO A BIG SPREADSHEET,


1280
0:51:30,366 --> 0:51:31,767
AND AT THE END OF THE SEMESTER,


1281
0:51:31,767 --> 0:51:33,5
YOU HAD THREE TEAMMATES PER PROJECT,


1282
0:51:33,5 --> 0:51:34,566
FIVE PROJECTS.


1283
0:51:34,566 --> 0:51:35,601
THAT'S 15 DATA POINTS.


1284
0:51:35,601 --> 0:51:36,867
THAT'S STATISTICALLY VALID.


1285
0:51:36,867 --> 0:51:39,366
AND YOU GET A BAR CHART TELLING YOU ON A RANKING


1286
0:51:39,366 --> 0:51:40,634
OF HOW EASY YOU ARE TO WORK WITH,


1287
0:51:40,634 --> 0:51:43,366
WHERE YOU STACK UP AGAINST YOUR PEERS.


1288
0:51:43,366 --> 0:51:46,601
BOY, THAT'S HARD FEEDBACK TO IGNORE.


1289
0:51:46,601 --> 0:51:49,0
SOME STILL MANAGED.


1290
0:51:49,0 --> 0:51:52,399
[laughter]


1291
0:51:52,399 --> 0:51:54,5
BUT FOR THE MOST PART, PEOPLE LOOKED AT THAT AND WENT,


1292
0:51:54,5 --> 0:51:56,634
"WOW, I'VE GOT TO PICK IT UP A NOTCH.


1293
0:51:56,634 --> 0:51:58,467
"I BETTER START THINKING ABOUT WHAT I'M SAYING


1294
0:51:58,467 --> 0:51:59,7
TO PEOPLE IN THESE MEETINGS."


1295
0:51:59,7 --> 0:52:2,399
AND THAT IS THE BEST GIFT AN EDUCATOR CAN GIVE


1296
0:52:2,399 --> 0:52:5,467
IS TO GET SOMEBODY TO BECOME SELF-REFLECTIVE.


1297
0:52:5,467 --> 0:52:6,9
SO THE ETC WAS WONDERFUL,


1298
0:52:6,9 --> 0:52:10,601
BUT EVEN THE ETC AND EVEN AS DON SCALES IT AROUND THE GLOBE,


1299
0:52:10,601 --> 0:52:14,199
IT'S STILL VERY LABOR INTENSIVE, YOU KNOW.


1300
0:52:14,199 --> 0:52:15,634
IT'S NOT TOMMY ONE AT A TIME.


1301
0:52:15,634 --> 0:52:18,166
IT'S NOT A RESEARCH GROUP TEN AT A TIME.


1302
0:52:18,166 --> 0:52:21,833
IT'S 50 OR 100 AT A TIME PER CAMPUS TIMES FOUR CAMPUSES.


1303
0:52:21,833 --> 0:52:25,733
BUT I WANTED SOMETHING INFINITELY SCALABLE, ALL RIGHT?


1304
0:52:25,733 --> 0:52:27,399
SCALABLE TO THE POINT WHERE MILLIONS


1305
0:52:27,399 --> 0:52:29,233
OR TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE


1306
0:52:29,233 --> 0:52:31,733
COULD CHASE THEIR DREAMS WITH SOMETHING.


1307
0:52:31,733 --> 0:52:33,934
AND, YOU KNOW, I GUESS THAT KIND OF A GOAL


1308
0:52:33,934 --> 0:52:37,66
REALLY DOES MAKE ME THE MAD HATTER.


1309
0:52:37,66 --> 0:52:42,801
SO ALICE IS A PROJECT THAT WE'VE WORKED ON FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.


1310
0:52:42,801 --> 0:52:45,968
IT'S A NOVEL WAY TO TEACH COMPUTER PROGRAMMING.


1311
0:52:45,968 --> 0:52:47,399
KIDS MAKE MOVIES AND GAMES,


1312
0:52:47,399 --> 0:52:49,601
THE HEAD FAKE--AGAIN, WE'RE BACK TO THE HEAD FAKES.


1313
0:52:49,601 --> 0:52:51,434
THE BEST WAY TO TEACH SOMEBODY SOMETHING


1314
0:52:51,434 --> 0:52:54,1
IS TO HAVE THEM THINK THEY'RE LEARNING SOMETHING ELSE.


1315
0:52:54,1 --> 0:52:55,666
I'VE DONE IT MY WHOLE CAREER.


1316
0:52:55,666 --> 0:52:57,934
AND THE HEAD FAKE HERE IS THAT THEY'RE LEARNING TO PROGRAM,


1317
0:52:57,934 --> 0:53:0,199
BUT THEY JUST THINK THEY'RE MAKING MOVIES AND VIDEO GAMES.


1318
0:53:0,199 --> 0:53:1,833
THIS THING HAS ALREADY BEEN DOWNLOADED


1319
0:53:1,833 --> 0:53:3,233
WELL OVER A MILLION TIMES.


1320
0:53:3,233 --> 0:53:5,533
THERE ARE EIGHT TEXTBOOKS THAT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT IT.


1321
0:53:5,533 --> 0:53:7,366
10% OF U.S. COLLEGES ARE USING IT NOW,


1322
0:53:7,366 --> 0:53:9,467
AND IT'S NOT THE GOOD STUFF YET.


1323
0:53:9,467 --> 0:53:14,366
THE GOOD STUFF IS COMING IN THE NEXT VERSION.


1324
0:53:14,366 --> 0:53:16,867
I, LIKE MOSES, GET TO SEE THE PROMISED LAND,


1325
0:53:16,867 --> 0:53:19,666
BUT I WON'T GET TO SET FOOT IN IT,


1326
0:53:19,666 --> 0:53:22,666
AND THAT'S OKAY, BECAUSE I CAN SEE IT,


1327
0:53:22,666 --> 0:53:25,3
AND THE VISION IS CLEAR:


1328
0:53:25,3 --> 0:53:30,66
MILLIONS OF KIDS HAVING FUN WHILE LEARNING SOMETHING HARD.


1329
0:53:30,66 --> 0:53:32,0
THAT'S PRETTY COOL.


1330
0:53:32,0 --> 0:53:34,199
I CAN DEAL WITH THAT AS A LEGACY.


1331
0:53:34,199 --> 0:53:35,968
THE NEXT VERSION'S GOING TO COME OUT IN 2008.


1332
0:53:35,968 --> 0:53:37,666
IT'S GOING TO BE TEACHING THE JAVA LANGUAGE


1333
0:53:37,666 --> 0:53:39,5
IF YOU WANT THEM TO KNOW THEY'RE LEARNING JAVA.


1334
0:53:39,5 --> 0:53:40,7
OTHERWISE THEY'LL JUST THINK


1335
0:53:40,7 --> 0:53:42,533
THAT THEY'RE WRITING MOVIE SCRIPTS.


1336
0:53:42,533 --> 0:53:45,733
AND WE'RE GETTING THE CHARACTERS


1337
0:53:45,733 --> 0:53:48,833
FROM THE BEST-SELLING PC GAME IN HISTORY, "THE SIMS."


1338
0:53:48,833 --> 0:53:50,9
AND THIS IS ALL ALREADY WORKING IN THE LAB,


1339
0:53:50,9 --> 0:53:53,366
SO THERE'S NO REAL TECHNOLOGICAL RISK.


1340
0:53:53,366 --> 0:53:55,366
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO THANK AND MENTION EVERYBODY


1341
0:53:55,366 --> 0:53:56,601
IN THE ALICE TEAM,


1342
0:53:56,601 --> 0:53:58,333
BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT DENNIS COSGROVE


1343
0:53:58,333 --> 0:54:0,366
IS GOING TO BE BUILDING THIS, HAS BEEN BUILDING THIS.


1344
0:54:0,366 --> 0:54:1,867
HE IS THE DESIGNER.


1345
0:54:1,867 --> 0:54:5,166
IT'S HIS BABY, AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE WONDERING,


1346
0:54:5,166 --> 0:54:7,32
"WELL, YOU KNOW, IN SOME NUMBER OF MONTHS,


1347
0:54:7,32 --> 0:54:9,32
WHO SHOULD I BE EMAILING ABOUT THE ALICE PROJECT,"


1348
0:54:9,32 --> 0:54:11,634
WHERE'S WANDA DANN?


1349
0:54:11,634 --> 0:54:12,767
OH, THERE YOU ARE.


1350
0:54:12,767 --> 0:54:14,968
STAND UP, LET THEM ALL SEE YOU.


1351
0:54:14,968 --> 0:54:16,467
EVERYBODY SAY, "HI, WANDA."


1352
0:54:16,467 --> 0:54:18,434
all: HI, WANDA.


1353
0:54:18,434 --> 0:54:21,166
Pausch: SEND HER THE EMAIL.


1354
0:54:21,166 --> 0:54:23,3
AND I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT CAITLIN KELLEHER,


1355
0:54:23,3 --> 0:54:25,267
BUT SHE'S GRADUATED WITH HER PhD


1356
0:54:25,267 --> 0:54:26,833
AND IS AT WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,


1357
0:54:26,833 --> 0:54:28,5
AND SHE'S GOING TO BE TAKING THIS UP A NOTCH


1358
0:54:28,5 --> 0:54:30,199
AND GOING TO MIDDLE SCHOOLS WITH IT.


1359
0:54:30,199 --> 0:54:33,801
SO GRAND VISION, AND TO THE EXTENT


1360
0:54:33,801 --> 0:54:35,3
THAT YOU CAN LIVE ON IN SOMETHING,


1361
0:54:35,3 --> 0:54:37,767
I WILL LIVE ON IN ALICE.


1362
0:54:37,767 --> 0:54:39,5
ALL RIGHT, SO NOW THE THIRD PART OF THE TALK,


1363
0:54:39,5 --> 0:54:40,833
LESSONS LEARNED.


1364
0:54:40,833 --> 0:54:42,366
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT MY DREAMS.


1365
0:54:42,366 --> 0:54:45,32
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HELPING OTHER PEOPLE ENABLE THEIR DREAMS.


1366
0:54:45,32 --> 0:54:46,3
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY,


1367
0:54:46,3 --> 0:54:47,601
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME ASPECT


1368
0:54:47,601 --> 0:54:51,333
OF WHAT LETS YOU GET TO ACHIEVE YOUR DREAMS.


1369
0:54:51,333 --> 0:54:54,733
FIRST ONE IS THE ROLE OF PARENTS, MENTORS, AND STUDENTS.


1370
0:54:54,733 --> 0:54:59,867
I WAS BLESSED TO HAVE BEEN BORN TO TWO INCREDIBLE PEOPLE.


1371
0:54:59,867 --> 0:55:4,233
THIS IS MY MOTHER ON HER 70TH BIRTHDAY.


1372
0:55:4,233 --> 0:55:5,733
I AM BACK HERE.


1373
0:55:5,733 --> 0:55:9,467
I HAVE JUST BEEN LAPPED.


1374
0:55:9,467 --> 0:55:13,934
THIS IS MY DAD RIDING A ROLLER COASTER ON HIS 80TH BIRTHDAY,


1375
0:55:13,934 --> 0:55:17,166
AND HE POINTS OUT THAT, YOU KNOW, HE'S NOT ONLY BRAVE;


1376
0:55:17,166 --> 0:55:18,566
HE'S TALENTED,


1377
0:55:18,566 --> 0:55:21,934
BECAUSE HE DID WIN THAT BIG BEAR THE SAME DAY.


1378
0:55:21,934 --> 0:55:25,867
MY DAD WAS SO FULL OF LIFE.


1379
0:55:25,867 --> 0:55:27,467
ANYTHING WITH HIM WAS AN ADVENTURE.


1380
0:55:27,467 --> 0:55:31,267
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THAT BAG, BUT I KNOW IT'S COOL.


1381
0:55:31,267 --> 0:55:34,5
MY DAD DRESSED UP AS SANTA CLAUS,


1382
0:55:34,5 --> 0:55:39,0
BUT HE ALSO DID VERY, VERY SIGNIFICANT THINGS


1383
0:55:39,0 --> 0:55:40,601
TO HELP LOTS OF PEOPLE.


1384
0:55:40,601 --> 0:55:44,199
THIS IS A DORMITORY IN THAILAND THAT MY MOM AND DAD UNDERWROTE,


1385
0:55:44,199 --> 0:55:47,467
AND EVERY YEAR, ABOUT 30 STUDENTS GET TO GO TO SCHOOL


1386
0:55:47,467 --> 0:55:48,733
WHO WOULDN'T HAVE OTHERWISE.


1387
0:55:48,733 --> 0:55:50,0
THIS IS SOMETHING


1388
0:55:50,0 --> 0:55:51,9
MY WIFE AND I HAVE ALSO BEEN INVOLVED IN HEAVILY,


1389
0:55:51,9 --> 0:55:53,399
AND THESE ARE THE KIND OF THINGS


1390
0:55:53,399 --> 0:55:56,833
THAT I THINK EVERYBODY OUGHT TO BE DOING, HELPING OTHERS.


1391
0:55:56,833 --> 0:55:59,166
BUT THE BEST STORY I HAVE ABOUT MY DAD IS--


1392
0:55:59,166 --> 0:56:0,601
UNFORTUNATELY MY DAD PASSED AWAY


1393
0:56:0,601 --> 0:56:1,9
A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO,


1394
0:56:1,9 --> 0:56:3,7
AND WHEN WE WERE GOING THROUGH HIS THINGS--


1395
0:56:3,7 --> 0:56:5,9
HE HAD FOUGHT IN WORLD WAR II IN THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE--


1396
0:56:5,9 --> 0:56:7,634
AND WHEN WE WERE GOING THROUGH HIS THINGS,


1397
0:56:7,634 --> 0:56:11,867
WE FOUND OUT HE HAD BEEN AWARDED THE BRONZE STAR FOR VALOR.


1398
0:56:11,867 --> 0:56:13,7
MY MOM DIDN'T KNOW IT.


1399
0:56:13,7 --> 0:56:20,199
IN 50 YEARS OF MARRIAGE, IT HAD JUST NEVER COME UP.


1400
0:56:20,199 --> 0:56:21,634
MY MOM.


1401
0:56:21,634 --> 0:56:26,166
MOTHERS ARE PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU EVEN WHEN YOU PULL THEIR HAIR.


1402
0:56:26,166 --> 0:56:28,267
AND I HAVE TWO GREAT MOM STORIES.


1403
0:56:28,267 --> 0:56:30,434
WHEN I WAS HERE STUDYING TO GET MY PhD


1404
0:56:30,434 --> 0:56:33,333
AND I WAS TAKING SOMETHING CALLED THE THEORY QUALIFIER,


1405
0:56:33,333 --> 0:56:34,968
WHICH I CAN DEFINITIVELY SAY


1406
0:56:34,968 --> 0:56:38,366
IS THE SECOND WORST THING IN MY LIFE AFTER CHEMOTHERAPY...


1407
0:56:38,366 --> 0:56:41,733
[laughter]


1408
0:56:41,733 --> 0:56:43,533
AND I WAS COMPLAINING TO MY MOTHER


1409
0:56:43,533 --> 0:56:45,199
ABOUT HOW HARD THIS TEST WAS


1410
0:56:45,199 --> 0:56:47,767
AND HOW AWFUL IT WAS, AND SHE JUST LEANED OVER,


1411
0:56:47,767 --> 0:56:49,366
AND SHE PATTED ME ON THE ARM, AND SHE SAID,


1412
0:56:49,366 --> 0:56:51,566
"WE KNOW HOW YOU FEEL, HONEY, AND REMEMBER,


1413
0:56:51,566 --> 0:56:54,333
WHEN YOUR FATHER WAS YOUR AGE, HE WAS FIGHTING THE GERMANS."


1414
0:56:54,333 --> 0:57:1,666
[laughter]


1415
0:57:1,666 --> 0:57:4,233
AFTER I GOT MY PhD, MY MOTHER TOOK GREAT RELISH


1416
0:57:4,233 --> 0:57:6,32
IN INTRODUCING ME AS, "THIS IS MY SON.


1417
0:57:6,32 --> 0:57:8,733
HE'S A DOCTOR BUT NOT THE KIND WHO HELPS PEOPLE."


1418
0:57:8,733 --> 0:57:14,133
[laughter]


1419
0:57:14,133 --> 0:57:15,634
THESE SLIDES ARE A LITTLE BIT DARK,


1420
0:57:15,634 --> 0:57:17,934
BUT WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, I DECIDED TO PAINT MY BEDROOM.


1421
0:57:17,934 --> 0:57:21,666
I'D ALWAYS WANTED A SUBMARINE AND AN ELEVATOR.


1422
0:57:21,666 --> 0:57:23,833
AND THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS--


1423
0:57:23,833 --> 0:57:29,434
[laughter]


1424
0:57:29,434 --> 0:57:31,867
WHAT CAN I SAY?


1425
0:57:31,867 --> 0:57:33,267
AND THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS IS,


1426
0:57:33,267 --> 0:57:35,0
THEY LET ME DO IT,


1427
0:57:35,0 --> 0:57:36,5
AND THEY DIDN'T GET UPSET ABOUT IT,


1428
0:57:36,5 --> 0:57:38,166
AND IT'S STILL THERE.


1429
0:57:38,166 --> 0:57:40,566
IF YOU GO TO MY PARENT'S HOUSE, IT'S STILL THERE.


1430
0:57:40,566 --> 0:57:42,434
AND ANYBODY WHO IS OUT THERE WHO IS A PARENT,


1431
0:57:42,434 --> 0:57:44,767
IF YOUR KIDS WANT TO PAINT THEIR BEDROOM,


1432
0:57:44,767 --> 0:57:47,199
AS A FAVOR TO ME, LET THEM DO IT, OKAY?


1433
0:57:47,199 --> 0:57:48,934
IT'LL BE OKAY.


1434
0:57:48,934 --> 0:57:52,634
DON'T WORRY ABOUT RESALE VALUE ON THE HOUSE.


1435
0:57:52,634 --> 0:57:55,666
OTHER PEOPLE WHO HELP US BESIDES OUR PARENTS: OUR TEACHERS,


1436
0:57:55,666 --> 0:57:58,601
OUR MENTORS, OUR FRIENDS, OUR COLLEAGUES.


1437
0:57:58,601 --> 0:58:2,399
GOD, WHAT IS THERE TO SAY ABOUT ANDY VAN DAM?


1438
0:58:2,399 --> 0:58:4,7
WHEN I WAS A FRESHMAN AT BROWN, HE WAS ON LEAVE,


1439
0:58:4,7 --> 0:58:7,199
AND ALL I HEARD ABOUT WAS THIS ANDY VAN DAM.


1440
0:58:7,199 --> 0:58:10,1
HE WAS LIKE A MYTHICAL CREATURE, LIKE A CENTAUR,


1441
0:58:10,1 --> 0:58:13,66
BUT LIKE A REALLY PISSED OFF CENTAUR,


1442
0:58:13,66 --> 0:58:15,666
AND EVERYBODY WAS, LIKE, REALLY SAD


1443
0:58:15,666 --> 0:58:20,833
THAT HE WAS GONE BUT KIND OF MORE RELAXED,


1444
0:58:20,833 --> 0:58:22,0
AND I FOUND OUT WHY,


1445
0:58:22,0 --> 0:58:23,767
BECAUSE I STARTED WORKING FOR ANDY.


1446
0:58:23,767 --> 0:58:25,7
I WAS A TEACHING ASSISTANT FOR HIM AS A SOPHOMORE,


1447
0:58:25,7 --> 0:58:27,867
AND I WAS QUITE AN ARROGANT YOUNG MAN,


1448
0:58:27,867 --> 0:58:30,968
AND I CAME IN TO SOME OFFICE HOURS,


1449
0:58:30,968 --> 0:58:32,3
AND OF COURSE IT WAS 9:00 AT NIGHT,


1450
0:58:32,3 --> 0:58:33,7
AND ANDY WAS THERE AT OFFICE HOURS,


1451
0:58:33,7 --> 0:58:34,801
WHICH IS YOUR FIRST CLUE


1452
0:58:34,801 --> 0:58:36,634
AS TO WHAT KIND OF PROFESSOR HE WAS.


1453
0:58:36,634 --> 0:58:38,7
AND I COME BOUNDING IN, AND, YOU KNOW,


1454
0:58:38,7 --> 0:58:40,267
I'M JUST--I'M GOING TO SAVE THE WORLD.


1455
0:58:40,267 --> 0:58:41,934
THERE'RE ALL THESE KIDS WAITING FOR HELP,


1456
0:58:41,934 --> 0:58:43,5
DA DA, DA DA, DA DA, DA DA.


1457
0:58:43,5 --> 0:58:46,133
AND AFTERWARDS, ANDY LITERALLY DUTCH-UNCLED--HE'S DUTCH, RIGHT?


1458
0:58:46,133 --> 0:58:47,267
HE DUTCH-UNCLED ME,


1459
0:58:47,267 --> 0:58:48,801
AND HE PUT HIS ARM AROUND MY SHOULDERS,


1460
0:58:48,801 --> 0:58:49,968
AND WE WENT FOR A LITTLE WALK,


1461
0:58:49,968 --> 0:58:53,366
AND HE SAID, "RANDY, IT'S SUCH A SHAME


1462
0:58:53,366 --> 0:58:58,366
"THAT PEOPLE PERCEIVE YOU AS SO ARROGANT,


1463
0:58:58,366 --> 0:59:0,867
"BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO LIMIT


1464
0:59:0,867 --> 0:59:4,7
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH IN LIFE."


1465
0:59:4,7 --> 0:59:8,666
WHAT A HELL OF A GOOD WAY TO WORD "YOU'RE BEING A JERK."


1466
0:59:8,666 --> 0:59:9,968
RIGHT?


1467
0:59:9,968 --> 0:59:11,3
HE DOESN'T SAY, "YOU'RE A JERK."


1468
0:59:11,3 --> 0:59:13,1
HE SAYS, "PEOPLE ARE PERCEIVING YOU THIS WAY,"


1469
0:59:13,1 --> 0:59:15,32
AND HE SAYS, "THE DOWNSIDE IS, IT'S GOING TO LIMIT


1470
0:59:15,32 --> 0:59:17,399
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH."


1471
0:59:17,399 --> 0:59:20,9
WHEN I GOT TO KNOW ANDY BETTER, THE BEATINGS BECAME MORE DIRECT.


1472
0:59:20,9 --> 0:59:24,7
[laughter]


1473
0:59:24,7 --> 0:59:26,434
I COULD TELL YOU ANDY STORIES FOR A MONTH,


1474
0:59:26,434 --> 0:59:28,801
BUT THE ONE I WILL TELL YOU IS THAT WHEN IT CAME TIME


1475
0:59:28,801 --> 0:59:30,133
TO START THINKING ABOUT WHAT TO DO


1476
0:59:30,133 --> 0:59:31,366
AFTER GRADUATING FROM BROWN,


1477
0:59:31,366 --> 0:59:33,133
IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO ME IN A MILLION YEARS


1478
0:59:33,133 --> 0:59:35,5
TO GO TO GRADUATE SCHOOL, JUST OUT OF MY IMAGINATION.


1479
0:59:35,5 --> 0:59:38,366
IT WASN'T THE KIND OF THING PEOPLE FROM MY FAMILY DID.


1480
0:59:38,366 --> 0:59:39,801
WE GOT, SAY, WHAT DO YOU CALL THEM?


1481
0:59:39,801 --> 0:59:42,0
JOBS.


1482
0:59:42,0 --> 0:59:44,666
AND ANDY SAID, "NO, DON'T GO DO THAT.


1483
0:59:44,666 --> 0:59:46,601
GO GET A PhD. BECOME A PROFESSOR."


1484
0:59:46,601 --> 0:59:48,199
AND I SAID, "WHY?"


1485
0:59:48,199 --> 0:59:52,3
AND HE SAID, "BECAUSE YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD SALESMAN


1486
0:59:52,3 --> 0:59:53,634
"THAT ANY COMPANY WHO GETS YOU


1487
0:59:53,634 --> 0:59:55,666
"IS GOING TO USE YOU AS A SALESMAN,


1488
0:59:55,666 --> 0:59:58,199
"AND YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE SELLING


1489
0:59:58,199 --> 1:0:6,66
SOMETHING WORTHWHILE LIKE EDUCATION."


1490
1:0:6,66 --> 1:0:9,166
THANKS.


1491
1:0:9,166 --> 1:0:12,366
ANDY WAS MY FIRST BOSS, SO TO SPEAK.


1492
1:0:12,366 --> 1:0:15,634
I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE A LOT OF BOSSES.


1493
1:0:15,634 --> 1:0:16,968
THAT RED CIRCLE IS WAY OFF.


1494
1:0:16,968 --> 1:0:19,634
AL IS OVER HERE.


1495
1:0:19,634 --> 1:0:22,166
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED THERE.


1496
1:0:22,166 --> 1:0:24,133
HE'S PROBABLY WATCHING THIS ON THE WEBCAST GOING,


1497
1:0:24,133 --> 1:0:29,533
"MY GOD, HE'S TARGETING, AND HE STILL CAN'T AIM!"


1498
1:0:29,533 --> 1:0:31,666
I DON'T WANT TO SAY MUCH ABOUT THE GREAT BOSSES I'VE HAD


1499
1:0:31,666 --> 1:0:33,467
EXCEPT THAT THEY WERE GREAT,


1500
1:0:33,467 --> 1:0:35,9
AND I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD HAVE HAD BAD BOSSES,


1501
1:0:35,9 --> 1:0:37,9
AND I HAVEN'T HAD TO ENDURE THAT EXPERIENCE,


1502
1:0:37,9 --> 1:0:39,634
AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO ALL OF THE PEOPLE


1503
1:0:39,634 --> 1:0:41,66
THAT I EVER HAD TO REPORT TO.


1504
1:0:41,66 --> 1:0:42,7
THEY'VE JUST BEEN INCREDIBLE.


1505
1:0:42,7 --> 1:0:44,634
BUT IT'S NOT JUST OUR BOSSES.


1506
1:0:44,634 --> 1:0:45,833
WE LEARN FROM OUR STUDENTS.


1507
1:0:45,833 --> 1:0:47,733
I THINK THE BEST HEAD FAKE OF ALL TIME


1508
1:0:47,733 --> 1:0:49,267
COMES FROM CAITLIN KELLEHER--


1509
1:0:49,267 --> 1:0:52,32
EXCUSE ME, DR. CAITLIN KELLEHER--


1510
1:0:52,32 --> 1:0:53,133
WHO JUST FINISHED UP HERE


1511
1:0:53,133 --> 1:0:54,833
AND IS STARTING AT WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,


1512
1:0:54,833 --> 1:0:56,5
AND SHE LOOKED AT ALICE


1513
1:0:56,5 --> 1:0:58,267
WHEN IT WAS AN EASIER WAY TO LEARN TO PROGRAM,


1514
1:0:58,267 --> 1:1:0,767
AND SHE SAID, "YEAH, BUT WHY IS THAT FUN?"


1515
1:1:0,767 --> 1:1:3,366
I WAS LIKE, "WELL, 'CAUSE I'M A COMPULSIVE MALE.


1516
1:1:3,366 --> 1:1:5,366
"I LIKE TO MAKE THE LITTLE TOY SOLDIERS MOVE AROUND


1517
1:1:5,366 --> 1:1:8,5
BY MY COMMAND, AND THAT'S FUN."


1518
1:1:8,5 --> 1:1:10,5
SHE'S LIKE, "HMM."


1519
1:1:10,5 --> 1:1:11,968
AND SHE WAS THE ONE WHO SAID,


1520
1:1:11,968 --> 1:1:14,867
"NO, WE'LL JUST APPROACH IT ALL AS A STORYTELLING ACTIVITY."


1521
1:1:14,867 --> 1:1:17,666
AND SHE'S DONE WONDERFUL WORK SHOWING THAT,


1522
1:1:17,666 --> 1:1:19,267
PARTICULARLY WITH MIDDLE SCHOOL GIRLS,


1523
1:1:19,267 --> 1:1:21,66
IF YOU PRESENT IT AS A STORYTELLING ACTIVITY,


1524
1:1:21,66 --> 1:1:22,5
THEY'RE PERFECTLY WILLING TO LEARN


1525
1:1:22,5 --> 1:1:24,32
HOW TO WRITE COMPUTER SOFTWARE.


1526
1:1:24,32 --> 1:1:27,32
SO ALL-TIME BEST HEAD FAKE AWARD


1527
1:1:27,32 --> 1:1:31,66
GOES TO CAITLIN KELLEHER'S DISSERTATION.


1528
1:1:31,66 --> 1:1:32,733
PRESIDENT COHON, WHEN I TOLD HIM


1529
1:1:32,733 --> 1:1:33,934
I WAS GOING TO DO THIS TALK,


1530
1:1:33,934 --> 1:1:37,166
HE SAID, "PLEASE TELL THEM ABOUT HAVING FUN,


1531
1:1:37,166 --> 1:1:41,133
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I REMEMBER YOU FOR."


1532
1:1:41,133 --> 1:1:43,166
AND I SAID, "I CAN DO THAT, BUT IT'S KIND OF LIKE A FISH


1533
1:1:43,166 --> 1:1:46,66
TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF WATER."


1534
1:1:46,66 --> 1:1:48,934
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO NOT HAVE FUN.


1535
1:1:48,934 --> 1:1:52,199
ALL RIGHT, I'M DYING, AND I'M HAVING FUN,


1536
1:1:52,199 --> 1:1:56,934
AND I'M GOING TO KEEP HAVING FUN EVERY DAY I HAVE LEFT,


1537
1:1:56,934 --> 1:1:59,467
BECAUSE THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO PLAY IT.


1538
1:1:59,467 --> 1:2:0,733
ALL RIGHT?


1539
1:2:0,733 --> 1:2:2,867
SO MY NEXT PIECE OF ADVICE IS,


1540
1:2:2,867 --> 1:2:4,767
YOU JUST HAVE TO DECIDE IF YOU'RE A TIGGER


1541
1:2:4,767 --> 1:2:6,601
OR YOU'RE AN EEYORE.


1542
1:2:6,601 --> 1:2:8,666
I THINK I'M CLEAR WHERE I STAND


1543
1:2:8,666 --> 1:2:13,533
ON THE GREAT TIGGER-EEYORE DEBATE.


1544
1:2:13,533 --> 1:2:17,32
NEVER LOSE THE CHILDLIKE WONDER.


1545
1:2:17,32 --> 1:2:18,634
IT'S JUST TOO IMPORTANT.


1546
1:2:18,634 --> 1:2:20,199
IT'S WHAT DRIVES US.


1547
1:2:20,199 --> 1:2:22,5
HELP OTHERS.


1548
1:2:22,5 --> 1:2:25,601
DENNY PROFFITT KNOWS MORE ABOUT HELPING OTHER PEOPLE.


1549
1:2:25,601 --> 1:2:27,801
HE'S FORGOTTEN MORE THAN I'LL EVER KNOW.


1550
1:2:27,801 --> 1:2:29,934
HE'S TAUGHT ME BY EXAMPLE HOW TO RUN A GROUP,


1551
1:2:29,934 --> 1:2:31,767
HOW TO CARE ABOUT PEOPLE.


1552
1:2:31,767 --> 1:2:32,9
M.K. HALEY-- I HAVE A THEORY


1553
1:2:32,9 --> 1:2:34,533
THAT PEOPLE WHO COME FROM LARGE FAMILIES


1554
1:2:34,533 --> 1:2:35,833
ARE BETTER PEOPLE,


1555
1:2:35,833 --> 1:2:37,833
BECAUSE THEY'VE JUST HAD TO LEARN HOW TO GET ALONG.


1556
1:2:37,833 --> 1:2:41,166
M.K. HALEY COMES FROM A FAMILY WITH 20 KIDS.


1557
1:2:41,166 --> 1:2:43,968
YEAH, UNBELIEVABLE.


1558
1:2:43,968 --> 1:2:46,833
AND SHE ALWAYS SAYS, "IT'S KIND OF FUN TO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE."


1559
1:2:46,833 --> 1:2:48,233
WHEN I FIRST GOT TO IMAGINEERING,


1560
1:2:48,233 --> 1:2:50,1
SHE WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO DRESSED ME DOWN,


1561
1:2:50,1 --> 1:2:51,601
AND SHE SAID, "I UNDERSTAND


1562
1:2:51,601 --> 1:2:53,1
"YOU'VE JOINED THE ALADDIN PROJECT.


1563
1:2:53,1 --> 1:2:54,733
WHAT CAN YOU DO?"


1564
1:2:54,733 --> 1:2:57,566
AND I SAID, "WELL, I'M A TENURED PROFESSOR OF COMPUTER SCIENCE."


1565
1:2:57,566 --> 1:2:59,801
AND SHE SAID, "WELL, THAT'S VERY NICE PROFESSOR BOY,


1566
1:2:59,801 --> 1:3:1,3
"BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I ASKED.


1567
1:3:1,3 --> 1:3:2,867
I SAID, 'WHAT CAN YOU DO?'"


1568
1:3:2,867 --> 1:3:9,9
[laughter]


1569
1:3:9,9 --> 1:3:15,399
AND, YOU KNOW, I MENTIONED SORT OF MY WORKING-CLASS ROOTS.


1570
1:3:15,399 --> 1:3:17,566
WE KEEP WHAT IS VALUABLE TO US, WHAT WE CHERISH,


1571
1:3:17,566 --> 1:3:19,767
AND I'VE KEPT MY LETTERMAN'S JACKET ALL THESE YEARS.


1572
1:3:19,767 --> 1:3:22,32
I USED TO LIKE WEARING IT IN GRAD SCHOOL,


1573
1:3:22,32 --> 1:3:25,934
AND ONE OF MY FRIENDS, JESSICA HODGINS WOULD SAY,


1574
1:3:25,934 --> 1:3:28,66
"WHY DO YOU WEAR THIS LETTERMAN'S JACKET?"


1575
1:3:28,66 --> 1:3:30,566
AND I LOOKED AROUND AT ALL THE NON-ATHLETIC GUYS AROUND ME


1576
1:3:30,566 --> 1:3:35,233
WHO WERE MUCH SMARTER THAN ME, AND I SAID, "BECAUSE I CAN."


1577
1:3:35,233 --> 1:3:38,133
AND SO SHE THOUGHT THAT WAS A REAL HOOT,


1578
1:3:38,133 --> 1:3:42,166
SO ONE YEAR SHE MADE FOR ME THIS LITTLE RAGGEDY RANDY DOLL.


1579
1:3:42,166 --> 1:3:44,566
HE'S GOT A LITTLE LETTERMAN'S JACKET TOO.


1580
1:3:44,566 --> 1:3:46,3
THAT'S MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE.


1581
1:3:46,3 --> 1:3:50,1
IT'S THE PERFECT GIFT FOR THE EGOMANIAC IN YOUR LIFE.


1582
1:3:50,1 --> 1:3:55,333
SO I'VE MET SO MANY WONDERFUL PEOPLE ALONG THE WAY.


1583
1:3:55,333 --> 1:3:57,199
LOYALTY IS A TWO-WAY STREET.


1584
1:3:57,199 --> 1:3:59,166
THERE WAS A YOUNG MAN NAMED DENNIS COSGROVE


1585
1:3:59,166 --> 1:4:5,133
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, AND WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG MAN,


1586
1:4:5,133 --> 1:4:9,0
LET'S JUST SAY THINGS HAPPENED,


1587
1:4:9,0 --> 1:4:13,9
AND I FOUND MYSELF TALKING TO A DEAN, AND THE DEAN--


1588
1:4:13,9 --> 1:4:17,233
NO, NOT THAT DEAN.


1589
1:4:17,233 --> 1:4:19,166
AND ANYWAY, THIS DEAN REALLY HAD IT IN FOR DENNIS,


1590
1:4:19,166 --> 1:4:20,166
AND I COULD NEVER FIGURE OUT WHY,


1591
1:4:20,166 --> 1:4:21,199
BECAUSE DENNIS WAS A FINE FELLOW,


1592
1:4:21,199 --> 1:4:22,199
BUT FOR SOME REASON,


1593
1:4:22,199 --> 1:4:23,566
THIS DEAN REALLY HAD IT IN FOR HIM.


1594
1:4:23,566 --> 1:4:25,767
AND I ENDED UP BASICALLY SAYING, "NO, I VOUCH FOR DENNIS."


1595
1:4:25,767 --> 1:4:27,867
AND THE GUY SAYS, "YOU'RE NOT EVEN TENURED YET,


1596
1:4:27,867 --> 1:4:30,267
AND YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU'RE GOING TO VOUCH


1597
1:4:30,267 --> 1:4:32,66
FOR THIS SOPHOMORE OR JUNIOR OR WHATEVER?"


1598
1:4:32,66 --> 1:4:33,399
I THINK HE WAS A JUNIOR AT THE TIME.


1599
1:4:33,399 --> 1:4:35,0
I SAID, "YEAH, I'M GOING TO VOUCH FOR HIM,


1600
1:4:35,0 --> 1:4:36,3
BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN HIM."


1601
1:4:36,3 --> 1:4:38,233
AND THE DEAN SAID, "AND I'M GOING TO REMEMBER THIS


1602
1:4:38,233 --> 1:4:40,133
WHEN YOUR TENURE CASE COMES UP."


1603
1:4:40,133 --> 1:4:41,533
AND I SAID, "DEAL."


1604
1:4:41,533 --> 1:4:43,601
I WENT BACK TO TALK TO DENNIS, AND I SAID,


1605
1:4:43,601 --> 1:4:48,934
"I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE YOU-- THAT WOULD BE GOOD."


1606
1:4:48,934 --> 1:4:50,399
BUT LOYALTY IS A TWO-WAY STREET.


1607
1:4:50,399 --> 1:4:52,533
I MEAN, THAT WAS GOD KNOWS HOW MANY YEARS AGO,


1608
1:4:52,533 --> 1:4:55,32
BUT THAT'S THE SAME DENNIS COSGROVE


1609
1:4:55,32 --> 1:4:57,32
WHO'S CARRYING ALICE FORWARD.


1610
1:4:57,32 --> 1:4:59,267
HE'S BEEN WITH ME ALL THESE YEARS, ALL RIGHT.


1611
1:4:59,267 --> 1:5:1,634
AND, YOU KNOW, IF WE ONLY HAD ONE PERSON


1612
1:5:1,634 --> 1:5:2,968
TO SEND IN A SPACE PROBE


1613
1:5:2,968 --> 1:5:8,7
TO MEET AN ALIEN SPECIES, I'M PICKING DENNIS.


1614
1:5:8,7 --> 1:5:10,267
YOU CAN'T GIVE A TALK AT CARNEGIE MELLON


1615
1:5:10,267 --> 1:5:13,533
WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING ONE VERY SPECIAL PERSON,


1616
1:5:13,533 --> 1:5:16,66
AND THAT WOULD BE SHARON BURKS.


1617
1:5:16,66 --> 1:5:17,3
I JOKED WITH HER.


1618
1:5:17,3 --> 1:5:18,9
I SAID, "WELL, LOOK, IF YOU'RE RETIRING,


1619
1:5:18,9 --> 1:5:20,7
IT'S JUST NOT WORTH LIVING ANYMORE."


1620
1:5:20,7 --> 1:5:24,233
[laughter]


1621
1:5:24,233 --> 1:5:26,867
SHARON IS SO WONDERFUL, IT'S BEYOND DESCRIPTION,


1622
1:5:26,867 --> 1:5:28,9
AND FOR ALL OF US WHO HAVE BEEN HELPED BY HER,


1623
1:5:28,9 --> 1:5:30,533
IT'S JUST INDESCRIBABLE.


1624
1:5:30,533 --> 1:5:31,566
I LOVE THIS PICTURE,


1625
1:5:31,566 --> 1:5:33,1
BECAUSE IT PUTS HER TOGETHER WITH SYL,


1626
1:5:33,1 --> 1:5:34,467
AND SYL IS GREAT,


1627
1:5:34,467 --> 1:5:38,3
BECAUSE SYL GAVE THE BEST PIECE OF ADVICE POUND FOR POUND


1628
1:5:38,3 --> 1:5:39,7
THAT I HAVE EVER HEARD,


1629
1:5:39,7 --> 1:5:42,601
AND I THINK ALL YOUNG LADIES SHOULD HEAR THIS.


1630
1:5:42,601 --> 1:5:44,199
SYL SAID, "IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME,


1631
1:5:44,199 --> 1:5:46,199
"BUT I'VE FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT.


1632
1:5:46,199 --> 1:5:49,968
"WHEN IT COMES TO MEN THAT ARE ROMANTICALLY INTERESTED IN YOU,


1633
1:5:49,968 --> 1:5:51,767
"IT'S REALLY SIMPLE.


1634
1:5:51,767 --> 1:5:54,634
"JUST IGNORE EVERYTHING THEY SAY


1635
1:5:54,634 --> 1:5:58,199
"AND ONLY PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT THEY DO.


1636
1:5:58,199 --> 1:6:1,199
IT'S THAT SIMPLE. IT'S THAT EASY."


1637
1:6:1,199 --> 1:6:3,399
AND I THOUGHT BACK TO MY BACHELOR DAYS,


1638
1:6:3,399 --> 1:6:9,566
AND I SAID, "DAMN."


1639
1:6:9,566 --> 1:6:11,199
NEVER GIVE UP.


1640
1:6:11,199 --> 1:6:12,934
I DIDN'T GET INTO BROWN UNIVERSITY.


1641
1:6:12,934 --> 1:6:14,666
I WAS ON THE WAIT LIST.


1642
1:6:14,666 --> 1:6:17,968
I CALLED THEM UP, AND THEY EVENTUALLY DECIDED


1643
1:6:17,968 --> 1:6:20,233
THAT IT WAS GETTING REALLY ANNOYING


1644
1:6:20,233 --> 1:6:23,1
TO HAVE ME CALL EVERY DAY, SO THEY LET ME IN.


1645
1:6:23,1 --> 1:6:25,267
AT CARNEGIE MELLON, I DIDN'T GET INTO GRADUATE SCHOOL.


1646
1:6:25,267 --> 1:6:26,267
ANDY HAD MENTORED ME.


1647
1:6:26,267 --> 1:6:27,5
HE SAID, "GO TO GRADUATE SCHOOL.


1648
1:6:27,5 --> 1:6:28,968
"YOU'RE GOING TO CARNEGIE MELLON.


1649
1:6:28,968 --> 1:6:31,733
ALL MY GOOD STUDENTS GO TO CARNEGIE MELLON."


1650
1:6:31,733 --> 1:6:33,601
AND, YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT'S COMING.


1651
1:6:33,601 --> 1:6:35,733
AND SO HE SAID, "YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO CARNEGIE MELLON,


1652
1:6:35,733 --> 1:6:37,66
NO PROBLEM."


1653
1:6:37,66 --> 1:6:39,199
WHAT HE HAD KIND OF FORGOTTEN WAS THAT THE DIFFICULTY


1654
1:6:39,199 --> 1:6:41,601
OF GETTING INTO THE TOP PhD PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRY


1655
1:6:41,601 --> 1:6:43,199
HAD REALLY GONE UP,


1656
1:6:43,199 --> 1:6:46,566
AND HE ALSO DIDN'T KNOW I WAS GOING TO TANK MY GREs,


1657
1:6:46,566 --> 1:6:48,32
BECAUSE HE BELIEVED IN ME,


1658
1:6:48,32 --> 1:6:49,533
WHICH, BASED ON MY BOARD SCORES,


1659
1:6:49,533 --> 1:6:51,533
WAS A REALLY STUPID IDEA,


1660
1:6:51,533 --> 1:6:53,3
AND SO I DIDN'T GET INTO CARNEGIE MELLON.


1661
1:6:53,3 --> 1:6:54,399
NO ONE KNOWS THIS TILL TODAY.


1662
1:6:54,399 --> 1:6:55,566
I'M TELLING THE STORY.


1663
1:6:55,566 --> 1:6:57,666
I WAS DECLINED ADMISSION TO CARNEGIE MELLON,


1664
1:6:57,666 --> 1:7:2,767
AND I WAS A BIT OF AN OBNOXIOUS LITTLE KID.


1665
1:7:2,767 --> 1:7:4,133
I WENT INTO ANDY'S OFFICE,


1666
1:7:4,133 --> 1:7:6,3
AND I DROPPED THE REJECTION LETTER ON HIS DESK.


1667
1:7:6,3 --> 1:7:7,801
AND I SAID, "I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW


1668
1:7:7,801 --> 1:7:9,666
"WHAT YOUR LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION GOES FOR


1669
1:7:9,666 --> 1:7:10,934
AT CARNEGIE MELLON."


1670
1:7:10,934 --> 1:7:18,634
[laughter]


1671
1:7:18,634 --> 1:7:22,0
AND BEFORE THE LETTER HAD HIT HIS DESK,


1672
1:7:22,0 --> 1:7:24,233
HIS HAND WAS ON THE PHONE, AND HE SAID,


1673
1:7:24,233 --> 1:7:26,5
"I WILL FIX THIS."


1674
1:7:26,5 --> 1:7:30,166
[laughter]


1675
1:7:30,166 --> 1:7:31,233
AND I SAID, "NO, NO, NO,


1676
1:7:31,233 --> 1:7:32,5
"I DON'T WANT TO DO IT THAT WAY.


1677
1:7:32,5 --> 1:7:33,801
"THAT'S NOT THE WAY I WAS RAISED.


1678
1:7:33,801 --> 1:7:35,634
"YOU KNOW, MAYBE SOME OTHER GRADUATE SCHOOLS


1679
1:7:35,634 --> 1:7:37,968
WILL SEE FIT TO ADMIT ME." AND HE SAID, "LOOK.


1680
1:7:37,968 --> 1:7:39,867
CARNEGIE MELLON'S WHERE YOU'RE GONNA BE."


1681
1:7:39,867 --> 1:7:41,767
HE SAID, "I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL.


1682
1:7:41,767 --> 1:7:42,968
GO VISIT THE OTHER SCHOOLS."


1683
1:7:42,968 --> 1:7:44,733
BECAUSE I DID GET INTO ALL THE OTHER SCHOOLS.


1684
1:7:44,733 --> 1:7:46,199
HE SAID, "GO VISIT THE OTHER SCHOOLS,


1685
1:7:46,199 --> 1:7:48,399
"AND IF YOU REALLY DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE AT ANY OF THEM,


1686
1:7:48,399 --> 1:7:51,0
THEN WILL YOU LET ME CALL NICO?" NICO BEING NICO HABERMANN.


1687
1:7:51,0 --> 1:7:53,5
AND I SAID, "OKAY, DEAL." I WENT TO THE OTHER SCHOOLS.


1688
1:7:53,5 --> 1:7:58,133
WITHOUT NAMING THEM BY NAME-- BERKELEY, CORNELL--


1689
1:7:58,133 --> 1:8:0,3
THEY MANAGED TO BE SO UNWELCOMING


1690
1:8:0,3 --> 1:8:1,801
THAT I FOUND MYSELF SAYING TO ANDY,


1691
1:8:1,801 --> 1:8:3,533
"YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TO GET A JOB."


1692
1:8:3,533 --> 1:8:5,267
AND HE SAID, "NO, YOU'RE NOT,"


1693
1:8:5,267 --> 1:8:8,199
AND HE PICKED UP THE PHONE, AND HE TALKED IN DUTCH.


1694
1:8:8,199 --> 1:8:11,0
[laughter]


1695
1:8:11,0 --> 1:8:13,199
AND HE HUNG UP THE PHONE, AND HE SAID,


1696
1:8:13,199 --> 1:8:14,934
"NICO SAYS IF YOU'RE SERIOUS,


1697
1:8:14,934 --> 1:8:19,9
BE IN HIS OFFICE TOMORROW MORNING AT 8:00 A.M."


1698
1:8:19,9 --> 1:8:22,434
AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW NICO,


1699
1:8:22,434 --> 1:8:24,399
THIS IS REALLY SCARY.


1700
1:8:24,399 --> 1:8:25,733
SO I'M IN NICO HABERMANN'S OFFICE


1701
1:8:25,733 --> 1:8:26,967
THE NEXT MORNING AT 8:00 A.M.,


1702
1:8:26,967 --> 1:8:29,166
AND HE'S TALKING WITH ME, AND FRANKLY,


1703
1:8:29,166 --> 1:8:31,733
I DON'T THINK HE'S THAT KEEN ON THIS MEETING.


1704
1:8:31,733 --> 1:8:33,166
I DON'T THINK HE'S THAT KEEN AT ALL.


1705
1:8:33,166 --> 1:8:39,233
AND HE SAYS, "RANDY, WHY ARE WE HERE?"


1706
1:8:39,233 --> 1:8:43,733
AND I SAID, "BECAUSE ANDY PHONED YOU?"


1707
1:8:43,733 --> 1:8:48,166
AND I SAID, "WELL, SINCE YOU ADMITTED ME,


1708
1:8:48,166 --> 1:8:50,33
"I HAVE WON A FELLOWSHIP.


1709
1:8:50,33 --> 1:8:51,767
"THE OFFICE OF NAVAL RESEARCH,


1710
1:8:51,767 --> 1:8:53,299
"IT'S A VERY PRESTIGIOUS FELLOWSHIP.


1711
1:8:53,299 --> 1:8:54,5
"I'VE WON THIS FELLOWSHIP,


1712
1:8:54,5 --> 1:8:56,601
AND THAT WASN'T IN MY FILE WHEN I APPLIED."


1713
1:8:56,601 --> 1:9:0,967
AND NICO SAID, "A FELLOWSHIP, MONEY, WE HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY."


1714
1:9:0,967 --> 1:9:4,633
THAT WAS BACK THEN.


1715
1:9:4,633 --> 1:9:6,33
HE SAID, "WE HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY.


1716
1:9:6,33 --> 1:9:7,868
"WHY DO YOU THINK HAVING A FELLOWSHIP


1717
1:9:7,868 --> 1:9:9,733
MAKES ANY DIFFERENCE TO US?"


1718
1:9:9,733 --> 1:9:10,934
AND HE LOOKED AT ME.


1719
1:9:10,934 --> 1:9:13,367
THERE ARE MOMENTS THAT CHANGE YOUR LIFE,


1720
1:9:13,367 --> 1:9:14,733
AND TEN YEARS LATER,


1721
1:9:14,733 --> 1:9:17,267
IF YOU KNOW IN RETROSPECT IT WAS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS,


1722
1:9:17,267 --> 1:9:18,666
YOU'RE BLESSED,


1723
1:9:18,666 --> 1:9:22,701
BUT TO KNOW IT AT THE MOMENT


1724
1:9:22,701 --> 1:9:27,367
WITH NICO STARING THROUGH YOUR SOUL...


1725
1:9:27,367 --> 1:9:28,767
AND I SAID, "I DIDN'T MEAN TO IMPLY


1726
1:9:28,767 --> 1:9:30,132
"ANYTHING ABOUT THE MONEY.


1727
1:9:30,132 --> 1:9:31,367
"IT'S JUST THAT IT WAS AN HONOR.


1728
1:9:31,367 --> 1:9:32,9
"THERE WERE ONLY 15 GIVEN NATIONWIDE,


1729
1:9:32,9 --> 1:9:34,132
"AND I DID THINK IT WAS AN HONOR


1730
1:9:34,132 --> 1:9:36,833
"THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE MERITORIOUS,


1731
1:9:36,833 --> 1:9:41,132
AND I APOLOGIZE IF THAT WAS PRESUMPTUOUS."


1732
1:9:41,132 --> 1:9:44,833
AND HE SMILED, AND THAT WAS GOOD.


1733
1:9:44,833 --> 1:9:47,132
SO HOW DO YOU GET PEOPLE TO HELP YOU?


1734
1:9:47,132 --> 1:9:48,399
YOU CAN'T GET THERE ALONE.


1735
1:9:48,399 --> 1:9:51,666
PEOPLE HAVE TO HELP YOU, AND I DO BELIEVE IN KARMA.


1736
1:9:51,666 --> 1:9:52,666
I BELIEVE IN PAYBACKS.


1737
1:9:52,666 --> 1:9:53,767
YOU GET PEOPLE TO HELP YOU


1738
1:9:53,767 --> 1:9:55,733
BY TELLING THE TRUTH, BEING EARNEST.


1739
1:9:55,733 --> 1:9:59,132
I'LL TAKE AN EARNEST PERSON OVER A HIP PERSON EVERY DAY,


1740
1:9:59,132 --> 1:10:0,299
BECAUSE HIP IS SHORT-TERM.


1741
1:10:0,299 --> 1:10:2,8
EARNEST IS LONG-TERM.


1742
1:10:2,8 --> 1:10:7,66
APOLOGIZE WHEN YOU SCREW UP AND FOCUS ON OTHER PEOPLE,


1743
1:10:7,66 --> 1:10:8,166
NOT ON YOURSELF.


1744
1:10:8,166 --> 1:10:10,733
AND I THOUGHT, HOW DO I POSSIBLY


1745
1:10:10,733 --> 1:10:13,1
MAKE A CONCRETE EXAMPLE OF THAT?


1746
1:10:13,1 --> 1:10:14,633
DO WE HAVE A CONCRETE EXAMPLE


1747
1:10:14,633 --> 1:10:16,733
OF FOCUSING ON SOMEBODY ELSE OVER THERE?


1748
1:10:16,733 --> 1:10:18,399
COULD WE BRING IT OUT?


1749
1:10:18,399 --> 1:10:20,9
SEE, YESTERDAY WAS MY WIFE'S BIRTHDAY.


1750
1:10:20,9 --> 1:10:23,601
IF THERE WAS EVER A TIME I MIGHT BE ENTITLED


1751
1:10:23,601 --> 1:10:24,733
TO HAVE THE FOCUS ON ME,


1752
1:10:24,733 --> 1:10:27,367
IT MIGHT BE THE LAST LECTURE.


1753
1:10:27,367 --> 1:10:29,1
BUT NO, I FEEL VERY BADLY


1754
1:10:29,1 --> 1:10:31,166
THAT MY WIFE DIDN'T REALLY GET A PROPER BIRTHDAY,


1755
1:10:31,166 --> 1:10:33,934
AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE VERY NICE IF 500 PEOPLE--


1756
1:10:33,934 --> 1:10:53,434
[applause]


1757
1:10:53,434 --> 1:10:56,534
all singing: HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU.


1758
1:10:56,534 --> 1:10:57,601
Pausch: HER NAME IS JAI.


1759
1:10:57,601 --> 1:11:0,967
all singing: HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU.


1760
1:11:0,967 --> 1:11:5,566
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DEAR JAI.


1761
1:11:5,566 --> 1:11:9,733
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU.


1762
1:11:9,733 --> 1:11:18,666
[cheers and applause]


1763
1:11:18,666 --> 1:11:27,367
Pausch: YOU GOT TO BLOW IT OUT.


1764
1:11:27,367 --> 1:11:28,566
ALL RIGHT.


1765
1:11:28,566 --> 1:11:37,833
[applause]


1766
1:11:37,833 --> 1:11:39,601
AND NOW YOU ALL HAVE AN EXTRA REASON


1767
1:11:39,601 --> 1:11:43,601
TO COME TO THE RECEPTION.


1768
1:11:43,601 --> 1:11:46,566
REMEMBER, BRICK WALLS LET US SHOW OUR DEDICATION.


1769
1:11:46,566 --> 1:11:48,299
THEY ARE THERE TO SEPARATE US


1770
1:11:48,299 --> 1:11:50,1
FROM THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T REALLY WANT


1771
1:11:50,1 --> 1:11:51,733
TO ACHIEVE THEIR CHILDHOOD DREAMS.


1772
1:11:51,733 --> 1:11:53,466
DON'T BAIL.


1773
1:11:53,466 --> 1:11:56,1
THE BEST OF THE GOLD IS AT THE BOTTOM OF BARRELS OF CRAP.


1774
1:11:56,1 --> 1:12:1,233
[laughter]


1775
1:12:1,233 --> 1:12:7,833
WHAT STEVE DIDN'T TELL YOU WAS THE BIG SABBATICAL AT EA.


1776
1:12:7,833 --> 1:12:11,2
I HAD BEEN THERE FOR 48 HOURS, AND THEY LOVED THE ETC.


1777
1:12:11,2 --> 1:12:12,333
WE WERE THE BEST.


1778
1:12:12,333 --> 1:12:13,601
WE WERE THE FAVORITES,


1779
1:12:13,601 --> 1:12:15,701
AND THEN SOMEBODY ELSE PULLED ME ASIDE AND SAID,


1780
1:12:15,701 --> 1:12:16,967
"OH, BY THE WAY,


1781
1:12:16,967 --> 1:12:18,733
"WE'RE ABOUT TO GIVE $8 MILLION TO USC


1782
1:12:18,733 --> 1:12:20,2
"TO BUILD A PROGRAM JUST LIKE YOURS.


1783
1:12:20,2 --> 1:12:22,233
WE'RE HOPING YOU CAN HELP THEM GET IT OFF THE GROUND."


1784
1:12:22,233 --> 1:12:27,466
[laughter]


1785
1:12:27,466 --> 1:12:28,868
AND THEN STEVE CAME ALONG AND SAID,


1786
1:12:28,868 --> 1:12:31,566
"THEY SAID WHAT? OH, GOD."


1787
1:12:31,566 --> 1:12:35,934
AND TO QUOTE A FAMOUS MAN, "I WILL FIX THIS."


1788
1:12:35,934 --> 1:12:37,2
AND HE DID.


1789
1:12:37,2 --> 1:12:39,132
STEVE HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE PARTNER,


1790
1:12:39,132 --> 1:12:40,566
AND WE HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP,


1791
1:12:40,566 --> 1:12:42,701
PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL,


1792
1:12:42,701 --> 1:12:44,267
AND HE HAS CERTAINLY BEEN POINT MAN


1793
1:12:44,267 --> 1:12:48,601
ON GETTING A GAMING ASSET TO HELP TEACH MILLIONS OF KIDS,


1794
1:12:48,601 --> 1:12:51,66
AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S JUST INCREDIBLE.


1795
1:12:51,66 --> 1:12:53,934
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE BEEN REASONABLE


1796
1:12:53,934 --> 1:12:57,299
FOR ME TO LEAVE 48 HOURS INTO THAT SABBATICAL,


1797
1:12:57,299 --> 1:13:0,0
BUT IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE RIGHT THING TO DO,


1798
1:13:0,0 --> 1:13:1,733
AND WHEN YOU DO THE RIGHT THING,


1799
1:13:1,733 --> 1:13:5,767
GOOD STUFF HAS A WAY OF HAPPENING.


1800
1:13:5,767 --> 1:13:7,967
GET A FEEDBACK LOOP AND LISTEN TO IT.


1801
1:13:7,967 --> 1:13:10,5
YOUR FEEDBACK LOOP CAN BE THIS DORKY SPREADSHEET THING I DID,


1802
1:13:10,5 --> 1:13:12,33
OR IT CAN JUST BE ONE GREAT MAN


1803
1:13:12,33 --> 1:13:14,0
WHO TELLS YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO HEAR.


1804
1:13:14,0 --> 1:13:16,267
THE HARD PART IS THE LISTENING TO IT.


1805
1:13:16,267 --> 1:13:18,534
ANYBODY CAN GET CHEWED OUT.


1806
1:13:18,534 --> 1:13:21,333
IT'S THE RARE PERSON WHO SAYS, "OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE RIGHT,"


1807
1:13:21,333 --> 1:13:23,8
AS OPPOSED TO, "NO WAIT, THE REAL REASON IS"--


1808
1:13:23,8 --> 1:13:25,267
WE'VE ALL HEARD THAT.


1809
1:13:25,267 --> 1:13:28,8
WHEN PEOPLE GIVE YOU FEEDBACK, CHERISH IT AND USE IT.


1810
1:13:28,8 --> 1:13:30,666
SHOW GRATITUDE.


1811
1:13:30,666 --> 1:13:33,1
WHEN I GOT TENURE, I TOOK ALL OF MY RESEARCH TEAM


1812
1:13:33,1 --> 1:13:34,967
DOWN TO DISNEYWORLD FOR A WEEK,


1813
1:13:34,967 --> 1:13:37,0
AND ONE OF THE OTHER PROFESSORS AT VIRGINIA SAID,


1814
1:13:37,0 --> 1:13:39,66
"HOW CAN YOU DO THAT?"


1815
1:13:39,66 --> 1:13:40,868
I SAID, "THESE PEOPLE JUST BUSTED THEIR ASS


1816
1:13:40,868 --> 1:13:42,666
"AND GOT ME THE BEST JOB IN THE WORLD FOR LIFE.


1817
1:13:42,666 --> 1:13:46,33
HOW COULD I NOT DO THAT?" RIGHT?


1818
1:13:46,33 --> 1:13:49,534
DON'T COMPLAIN; JUST WORK HARDER.


1819
1:13:49,534 --> 1:13:51,66
THAT'S A PICTURE OF JACKIE ROBINSON.


1820
1:13:51,66 --> 1:13:52,601
IT WAS IN HIS CONTRACT NOT TO COMPLAIN,


1821
1:13:52,601 --> 1:13:56,601
EVEN WHEN THE FANS SPIT ON HIM.


1822
1:13:56,601 --> 1:14:0,267
BE GOOD AT SOMETHING; IT MAKES YOU VALUABLE.


1823
1:14:0,267 --> 1:14:2,367
WORK HARD.


1824
1:14:2,367 --> 1:14:4,2
I GOT TENURE A YEAR EARLY AS STEVE MENTIONED.


1825
1:14:4,2 --> 1:14:5,8
JUNIOR FACULTY MEMBERS USED TO SAY TO ME,


1826
1:14:5,8 --> 1:14:7,1
"WOW, YOU GOT TENURE EARLY.


1827
1:14:7,1 --> 1:14:9,267
WHAT'S YOUR SECRET?"


1828
1:14:9,267 --> 1:14:10,566
I SAID, "IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE.


1829
1:14:10,566 --> 1:14:12,466
"CALL ME ANY FRIDAY NIGHT IN MY OFFICE AT 10:00,


1830
1:14:12,466 --> 1:14:15,2
AND I'LL TELL YOU."


1831
1:14:15,2 --> 1:14:16,299
FIND THE BEST IN EVERYBODY.


1832
1:14:16,299 --> 1:14:17,633
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT JON SNODDY,


1833
1:14:17,633 --> 1:14:19,132
AS I SAID, TOLD ME


1834
1:14:19,132 --> 1:14:22,8
IS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT A LONG TIME, SOMETIMES YEARS,


1835
1:14:22,8 --> 1:14:25,5
BUT PEOPLE WILL SHOW YOU THEIR GOOD SIDE.


1836
1:14:25,5 --> 1:14:29,934
JUST KEEP WAITING, NO MATTER HOW LONG IT TAKES.


1837
1:14:29,934 --> 1:14:31,9
NO ONE IS ALL EVIL.


1838
1:14:31,9 --> 1:14:32,9
EVERYBODY HAS A GOOD SIDE.


1839
1:14:32,9 --> 1:14:33,9
JUST KEEP WAITING.


1840
1:14:33,9 --> 1:14:34,934
IT WILL COME OUT.


1841
1:14:34,934 --> 1:14:36,2
AND BE PREPARED.


1842
1:14:36,2 --> 1:14:39,868
LUCK IS TRULY WHERE PREPARATION MEETS OPPORTUNITY.


1843
1:14:39,868 --> 1:14:43,132
SO TODAY'S TALK WAS ABOUT MY CHILDHOOD DREAMS,


1844
1:14:43,132 --> 1:14:49,166
ENABLING THE DREAMS OF OTHERS, AND SOME LESSONS LEARNED.


1845
1:14:49,166 --> 1:14:54,33
BUT DID YOU FIGURE OUT THE HEAD FAKE?


1846
1:14:54,33 --> 1:14:56,5
IT'S NOT ABOUT HOW TO ACHIEVE YOUR DREAMS.


1847
1:14:56,5 --> 1:14:59,233
IT'S ABOUT HOW TO LEAD YOUR LIFE.


1848
1:14:59,233 --> 1:15:0,967
IF YOU LEAD YOUR LIFE THE RIGHT WAY,


1849
1:15:0,967 --> 1:15:2,767
THE KARMA WILL TAKE CARE OF ITSELF.


1850
1:15:2,767 --> 1:15:5,534
THE DREAMS WILL COME TO YOU.


1851
1:15:5,534 --> 1:15:10,767
