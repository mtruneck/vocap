See, when women
tell me things,


393
0:17:59,878 --> 0:18:2,8
I believe them.


394
0:18:2,8 --> 0:18:3,848
Behhhh!


395
0:18:3,848 --> 0:18:5,883
See, Suzanne told you she
doesn't do unplanned well.


396
0:18:5,883 --> 0:18:7,952
She said she'd rather
just go to work.


397
0:18:7,952 --> 0:18:9,22
Now, was she lying?


398
0:18:9,22 --> 0:18:10,221
No.


399
0:18:10,221 --> 0:18:11,688
She told you
the truth about herself,


400
0:18:11,688 --> 0:18:13,823
and you convinced her
to do something different.


401
0:18:13,823 --> 0:18:14,957
Sorry, buddy.


402
0:18:14,957 --> 0:18:16,559
This one's on you.


403
0:18:16,559 --> 0:18:18,66
But if it's any consolation,


404
0:18:18,66 --> 0:18:34,809
those were
some kick-ass waffles.


405
0:18:34,809 --> 0:18:35,843
It's noon.


406
0:18:35,843 --> 0:18:37,844
How come you're not at work?


407
0:18:37,844 --> 0:18:38,912
Lunch.


408
0:18:38,912 --> 0:18:42,314
I give myself 50 minutes.


409
0:18:42,314 --> 0:18:43,982
I'm sorry.


410
0:18:43,982 --> 0:18:45,917
What are you sorry for?


411
0:18:45,917 --> 0:18:47,485
Whatever made you mad.


412
0:18:47,485 --> 0:18:49,721
You know,
I do work hard,


413
0:18:49,721 --> 0:18:52,458
even though
it may not seem like it to you.


414
0:18:52,458 --> 0:18:53,625
No, no.


415
0:18:53,625 --> 0:18:55,393
Honey, I understand.


416
0:18:55,393 --> 0:18:57,762
Count Dooku is
a menace to society


417
0:18:57,762 --> 0:18:58,829
and needs to be dealt with.


418
0:18:58,829 --> 0:19:4,668
The Empire is not gonna
defeat itself.


419
0:19:4,668 --> 0:19:7,7
Honey...


420
0:19:7,7 --> 0:19:10,38
I'm glad that you have
a job that you love.


421
0:19:10,38 --> 0:19:13,675
I guess I just wanted to feel
more important.


422
0:19:13,675 --> 0:19:15,71
Of course you are.


423
0:19:15,71 --> 0:19:19,847
You know that.


424
0:19:19,847 --> 0:19:22,716
You never said
what you were sorry for.


425
0:19:22,716 --> 0:19:24,85
I tried to make you do
what I would do


426
0:19:24,85 --> 0:19:26,252
if I had a few days off


427
0:19:26,252 --> 0:19:27,786
instead of listening to you.


428
0:19:27,786 --> 0:19:30,22
I want you to respect
the way I operate,


429
0:19:30,22 --> 0:19:33,24
so I should respect
the way you operate.


430
0:19:33,24 --> 0:19:35,925
I like that.


431
0:19:35,925 --> 0:19:37,76
And I love you.


432
0:19:37,76 --> 0:19:39,895
I love you too, baby.


433
0:19:39,895 --> 0:19:40,929
Anybody home?


434
0:19:40,929 --> 0:19:44,499
Because these kids are.


435
0:19:44,499 --> 0:19:49,36
Damn.


436
0:19:49,36 --> 0:19:50,271
What happened?


437
0:19:50,271 --> 0:19:51,873
Why are you home so early?


438
0:19:51,873 --> 0:19:54,408
Because these are
your kids, not mine.


439
0:19:54,408 --> 0:19:55,876
But you said
you'd give me till 3:00.


440
0:19:55,876 --> 0:19:59,945
Well, my nerves
only gave me till now.


441
0:19:59,945 --> 0:20:3,148
Ma, I never asked you
for anything, right?


442
0:20:3,148 --> 0:20:5,55
Wrong; You asked me
to take care of your kids


443
0:20:5,55 --> 0:20:6,917
two days in a row.


444
0:20:6,917 --> 0:20:8,285
I meant before that.


445
0:20:8,285 --> 0:20:10,253
Wait, don't try
to guilt-trip me.


446
0:20:10,253 --> 0:20:11,854
Just tell me
what you want.


447
0:20:11,854 --> 0:20:13,388
I need you to stay here
with the kids.


448
0:20:13,388 --> 0:20:14,456
What?


449
0:20:14,456 --> 0:20:15,957
I want to spend some time
with Suzanne.


450
0:20:15,957 --> 0:20:17,625
I thought
you had to work.


451
0:20:17,625 --> 0:20:20,93
Not today.


452
0:20:20,93 --> 0:20:21,995
Where are you going?


453
0:20:21,995 --> 0:20:23,863
To spend some time
with the kids.


454
0:20:23,863 --> 0:20:25,931
I don't want to sit around
for another day and a half,


455
0:20:25,931 --> 0:20:27,732
and I don't want to bother you
while you're working.


456
0:20:27,732 --> 0:20:28,766
I'm not working today.


457
0:20:28,766 --> 0:20:29,901
I'm taking the day off.


458
0:20:29,901 --> 0:20:31,503
Mom's gonna stay home
with the kids.


459
0:20:31,503 --> 0:20:32,705
Both: For real?


460
0:20:32,705 --> 0:20:33,806
Look,


461
0:20:33,806 --> 0:20:35,608
I don't mind
bonding with you,


462
0:20:35,608 --> 0:20:38,21
but you have got to stop
trying to touch me.


463
0:20:38,21 --> 0:20:41,646
Okay, so...


464
0:20:41,646 --> 0:20:43,18
What are we gonna do?


465
0:20:43,18 --> 0:20:45,282
Well, I figure we could go
to Pike's Place,


466
0:20:45,282 --> 0:20:47,45
grab a little something
to eat,


467
0:20:47,45 --> 0:20:49,352
go shopping,


468
0:20:49,352 --> 0:20:50,453
and go somewhere
and finish


469
0:20:50,453 --> 0:20:52,289
what we were talking about
upstairs.


470
0:20:52,289 --> 0:20:54,525
For the record,


471
0:20:54,525 --> 0:20:56,201
we know
what you're talking about.
