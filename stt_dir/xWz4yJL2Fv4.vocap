###14 CHADD MCKEEN: In a time where our economic stability is--
###18 it's in shambles.
###19 We're in trouble.
###20 And if we're not willing to look at possible solutions
###23 outside the box, we're doomed.
###26 If money could grow on trees, wouldn't we start growing
###29 those trees?
###30 Well.
###32 
###42 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###53 I really get a feeling you can't imagine
###57 when you help somebody.
###58 You have somebody come in here who's dying.
###60 And they say, hey man, I'm dying, and they tell me I got
###62 x amount of months to live.
###65 I'm not even going to be able to enjoy the last
###66 six months I have.
###68 And they say, I don't want to take these pills.
###69 They make me constipated.
###70 I can't eat.
###71 I can't sleep.
###73 And to give them a medicine and say, OK, you have what?
###76 OK, cool.
###78 This one.
###79 And you give that to them.
###80 And they come back a week later.
###81 And they go, oh my god.
###86 You have no idea.
###88 I stopped taking all my pain pills.
###90 I've stopped taking all my insomnia pills.
###93 I stopped taking this.
###93 I stopped taking that.
###95 And that's incredibly rewarding to me.

###101 Medical marijuana is legal on a state level in 17 states.
###105 It is illegal federally, period.
###108 What this all originally started out
###110 with was a great idea.
###111 Proposition 215 was basically an idea that people who were
###117 dying from wasting and pain issues, like cancer or AIDS,
###123 benefited greatly through the use of cannabis.
###126 That's Prop 215.
###127 Now the problem with that is it was written so vaguely, it
###130 was just a real simple, simple piece of legislature.
###134 And it really got whored out, so to speak.
###139 And people began to realize they could take advantage of
###141 the looseness of the way this was written and make it a
###145 profitable situation, people who really didn't care about
###148 medical issues.
###149 
###155 We decided to start Otherside Farms out of selfish reasons,
###159 to be honest.
###160 I wanted to find a way to cure my wife's cancer.
###164 My wife was fighting cancer, and the chemo
###167 wasn't really working.
###169 Hi.
###171 And she actually saw firsthand on one of her biopsy spots
###177 that it worked.
###178 I had some Rick Simpson oil, and I put on a Bandaid, and I
###182 said let's put this on there.
###184 So I put this right there, and in 36 hours--
###188 36 hours--
###189 it disappeared completely.
###193 This stuff works.
###194 It's irresponsible to not take advantage of the situation.
###197 That's kind of weird, too, because it's supposed to be
###199 95% Chocolate Thai.
###201 You'd think it would be more of a prevalent.
###203 FEMALE SPEAKER: Smells more melony to me.
###204 CHADD MCKEEN: Smells super melony.
###206 Mm, smells so good.
###209 Now a letter went out from the Department of Justice to all
###213 city attorneys.
###214 It basically says, if you have someone that has
###218 1,000 plants or more--
###220 250 kilos, I think it is, that's like 400 pounds.
###224 Crazy, dude.
###225 400 pounds, dude.
###227 If you have someone in your city that you think falls
###229 within these parameters, let us know and we'll come help
###232 you check them out, raid them, and you know, the whole thing.
###237 6:00 in the morning on January 17, I hear a
###240 pounding at my door.
###241 My wife ran downstairs, opened the door for them, and said,
###243 hey, I've got a sick child upstairs
###245 on a breathing machine.
###246 If you're going to shoot me in the back,
###247 shoot me in the back.
###248 I'm going to go take care of my kid.
###249 And so she ran back upstairs to take care of Trevor.
###251 They stood at the door, got my daughter
###253 out, put her in handcuffs.
###254 16-year-old.
###256 And I looked at him like, hey, you didn't have to come in my
###257 house like this, man.
###259 
###262 (IMITATING COP VOICE) Come downstairs, sir.
###265 And I went down there, and they threw me in handcuffs.
###267 So I gave them the combo to my gun safe that's upstairs,
###270 where they found probably a half a pound of shake.
###274 And that's all they got out of our house.
###275 No guns, no other drugs, no huge dashes of cash, no huge
###279 stash of marijuana.
###280 They took the keys to our dispensary,
###282 opened everything up.
###283 And you know what they got out of my store?
###285 Huge safe.
###287 They got it open.
###289 They open it up.
###291 One jar.
###294 And they killed a couple hundred plants.
###297 They got me with ounces.
###300 They got me with a couple hundred plants.
###302 I was stunned.
###303 I was absolutely stunned.
###305 So afraid they were going to come again.
###308 Because they could come take whatever they want.
###310 This is America.
###311 This is not supposed to happen here.
###312 This is not supposed to happen here, man.
###317 You see here, this is our storage room.
###319 Every facility I have always has a nice storage room where
###321 we keep stuff-- tools and whatnot.
###324 The way things are in our society today, we've gotta get
###327 kind of sneaky about things.
###329 
###333 I got to go through this kind of stuff, and risk my freedom
###336 like a superhero, to help save people's lives.
###340 But I got to do what I got to do.
###343 This room is being prepped.
###345 Those plants are all going to come into this room.
###347 Every time that the plants get taken out,
###349 this all gets cleaned.
###350 It's like a lab.
###351 So, this is cool.
###356 Shh, the babies are sleeping.
###359 We want to come in so the light doesn't hit them.
###361 
###369 You guys see how big these fucking plants are?
###371 Things are massive, dude, like a half pound
###374 each off these guys.
###377 In the state of California, it used to be that you could have
###380 six mature plants or twelve immature plants per patient.
###386 Well, then people started making tinctures and started
###389 making the Rick Simpson oil, where you need 16 pounds of
###393 quality marijuana to make one ounce of this
###395 stuff that cures cancer.
###396 Now we've got a whole different situation, because
###399 those six plants aren't going to take care of the way I want
###401 to do my medicine.
###403 So California Supreme Court said that you can't put
###405 limitations on a patient's medicine.
###407 So now you can grow as many as you can justify growing.
###410 We still went by the six and twelve guideline.
###413 I wasn't going to push the envelope.
###416 That's why our plant count was down low.
###417 We grew trees.
###418 I waited and I had a system.
###420 That's why they're all in different sized things.
###421 It's math here.
###422 This is all math.
###424 I've maximized every square inch.
###426 I figured out how to tax this.
###428 I figured out how to create jobs.
###429 Isn't that worthy of at least a conversation?
###431 I mean, why do you kick the door open of the man that
###433 invited you to his house?
###437 How do you raid that man?
###438 I don't understand.
###438 I was doing everything the way you're supposed to do it.
###440 This shouldn't have happened to me.
###442 
###447 Hey, I'm going to keep doing things my way.
###449 That's the bottom line.
###450 
###454 You got to kill me if you want me to stop helping people.
###457 Because I actually get off on the fact that you
###459 want to stop me.
###460
