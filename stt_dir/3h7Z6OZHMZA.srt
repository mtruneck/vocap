HARVII: When people want to
think of hobbies, you think of


3
0:0:29,27 --> 0:0:30,94
singing and acting.


4
0:0:30,94 --> 0:0:32,19
You don't think of celebrity.


5
0:0:32,19 --> 0:0:35,182



6
0:0:35,182 --> 0:0:38,46
Or how much you try, or how much
you wait, and then when


7
0:0:38,46 --> 0:0:40,665
you meet them you find
it so worth it.


8
0:0:40,665 --> 0:0:42,37
And you're just such in a
good mood after that.


9
0:0:42,37 --> 0:0:43,8
It's like a really
good feeling.


10
0:0:43,8 --> 0:0:51,5
[MUSIC PLAYING]


11
0:0:51,5 --> 0:0:52,876
HARVII: I think nearly everyone
there is would want


12
0:0:52,876 --> 0:0:55,73
to be friends with at least one
celebrity just because of


13
0:0:55,73 --> 0:0:59,804
how famous they are and
just knowing them.

BILLIE JD PORTER:
This is Harvii.


16
0:1:16,655 --> 0:1:19,34
He became an overnight internet
sensation after this


17
0:1:19,34 --> 0:1:22,29
image where he's trying to give
actress Megan Fox a rose


18
0:1:22,29 --> 0:1:24,7
went viral.


19
0:1:24,7 --> 0:1:27,42
The story blew up so much that
he was even flown to America


20
0:1:27,42 --> 0:1:30,2
to appear on various TV shows.


21
0:1:30,2 --> 0:1:33,42
In this film, I follow Harvii
and a few other people we meet


22
0:1:33,42 --> 0:1:36,6
along the way as they push their
celebrity obsessions to


23
0:1:36,6 --> 0:1:36,81
the extreme.


24
0:1:36,81 --> 0:1:43,97
[MUSIC PLAYING]


25
0:1:43,97 --> 0:1:45,215
BILLIE JD PORTER: So what
was it like, the


26
0:1:45,215 --> 0:1:46,68
whole Megan Fox thing?


27
0:1:46,68 --> 0:1:47,57
HARVII: I loved it.


28
0:1:47,57 --> 0:1:50,27
You had, like, paparazzis at the
airports and everything.


29
0:1:50,27 --> 0:1:51,25
It was fun.


30
0:1:51,25 --> 0:1:53,74
It was, like, my little
sport [INAUDIBLE]


31
0:1:53,74 --> 0:1:55,16
and my little five
minutes of fame.


32
0:1:55,16 --> 0:1:57,678
I loved it.


33
0:1:57,678 --> 0:1:59,4
Loved it.


34
0:1:59,4 --> 0:2:1,31
We got saved for, like, another
few days because


35
0:2:1,31 --> 0:2:3,7
that's when, like, loads of
people were asking for


36
0:2:3,7 --> 0:2:4,37
interviews.


37
0:2:4,37 --> 0:2:4,89
And we did them.


38
0:2:4,89 --> 0:2:5,98
Then we got sent back.


39
0:2:5,98 --> 0:2:8,63
And then I did a few
things in England.


40
0:2:8,63 --> 0:2:10,919
And then it all died down
because of Michael Jackson.


41
0:2:10,919 --> 0:2:15,9
And then, like, now it's, like,
nothing's happening.


42
0:2:15,9 --> 0:2:17,1
BILLIE JD PORTER: During this
interview, Megan gave a warm


43
0:2:17,1 --> 0:2:18,49
and heartfelt apology.


44
0:2:18,49 --> 0:2:19,953
MEGAN FOX (OFFSCREEN):
I'm sorry, sweet boy.


45
0:2:19,953 --> 0:2:21,18
I would ever do that to you.


46
0:2:21,18 --> 0:2:24,11
I would gladly accept your
rose if I see you again.


47
0:2:24,11 --> 0:2:27,33
The paparazzi will not let
you to me and I'm sorry.


48
0:2:27,33 --> 0:2:29,13
And I'm so embarrassed.


49
0:2:29,13 --> 0:2:34,4



50
0:2:34,4 --> 0:2:35,565
BILLIE JD PORTER: Could
you name every


51
0:2:35,565 --> 0:2:37,686
celebrity you've ever met?


52
0:2:37,686 --> 0:2:38,78
HARVII: Oh, god.

0:2:40,316 --> 0:2:40,66
HARVII: Oh, god.


55
0:2:40,66 --> 0:2:42,48
That would take ages.


56
0:2:42,48 --> 0:2:47,33
Selina Gomez, Black Eyed Peas,
Lilly Allen, Bono.

61
0:3:3,19 --> 0:3:5,55
I honestly can't think now.


62
0:3:5,55 --> 0:3:7,57
I would say I'm happy.


63
0:3:7,57 --> 0:3:10,41
BILLIE JD PORTER: What would
make you happier?


64
0:3:10,41 --> 0:3:12,829
HARVII: Being famous.

0:3:23,182 --> 0:3:25,647

0:3:27,62 --> 0:3:29,31
MALE SPEAKER: I'm here today to
audition for Big Brother.


69
0:3:29,31 --> 0:3:31,37
The last one, so I thought
I'd give it to go.


70
0:3:31,37 --> 0:3:33,32
And this year is
my third year.


71
0:3:33,32 --> 0:3:36,1
And I haven't been onto the rest
of the show, so I thought


72
0:3:36,1 --> 0:3:37,3
more chance of getting
through.


73
0:3:37,3 --> 0:3:40,23
MALE SPEAKER: I love my job at
the moment, [INAUDIBLE].


74
0:3:40,23 --> 0:3:42,8
But I also do want to
be a DJ as well.


75
0:3:42,8 --> 0:3:43,85
FEMALE SPEAKER: I can't sing.


76
0:3:43,85 --> 0:3:44,645
I can dance.


77
0:3:44,645 --> 0:3:46,71
I can kick box really well.


78
0:3:46,71 --> 0:3:50,5
I don't really stand out at
anything I do, really.


79
0:3:50,5 --> 0:3:53,145
FEMALE SPEAKER: I just want to
be famous, have the fame and


80
0:3:53,145 --> 0:3:54,13
fortune and the parties.


81
0:3:54,13 --> 0:3:56,47
MALE SPEAKER: But you know, just
would be quite cool, you


82
0:3:56,47 --> 0:3:58,67
you're walking down the
street and you have


83
0:3:58,67 --> 0:3:59,53
people recognize you.


84
0:3:59,53 --> 0:4:1,29
MALE SPEAKER: For me, I think
I'm really cool and funny.


85
0:4:1,29 --> 0:4:4,276
And I just think it would be an
amazing experience to do.


86
0:4:4,276 --> 0:4:6,57
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think, yeah,
that we're a bit rambunctious.


87
0:4:6,57 --> 0:4:8,975

actually flamboyant.

the premiers.


92
0:4:14,855 --> 0:4:16,23
I'm going to try and
go to parties.


93
0:4:16,23 --> 0:4:18,589
If I can get myself on TV
shows, I'll do them.


94

everybody these days wants to


95

have their 15 minutes of fame,
or even one minute of fame.


96
0:4:22,85 --> 0:4:27,6
You know, and I think it's the
lifestyle that comes with it.


97

Edward, the little blondies

can't wait for?

to get tickets.

0:5:0,77 --> 0:5:3,21
We're like such big
fans of them.


117
0:5:3,21 --> 0:5:4,45
I've met Kim Cattrall.


118
0:5:4,45 --> 0:5:6,59
And I've seen Sarah
Jessica Parker.


119
0:5:6,59 --> 0:5:10,6
But Sarah Jessica Parker
basically, I saw


120
0:5:10,6 --> 0:5:10,75
her outside the hotel.


121
0:5:10,75 --> 0:5:11,78
I was waiting for her.


122
0:5:11,78 --> 0:5:13,37
And I was like, Sarah,
Sarah, please.


123
0:5:13,37 --> 0:5:14,4
And she was like, I'm sorry.


124
0:5:14,4 --> 0:5:14,97
I've got to go in.


125
0:5:14,97 --> 0:5:15,82
And then guess what?


126
0:5:15,82 --> 0:5:17,13
My friend, Sommer, doesn't
even like her.


127
0:5:17,13 --> 0:5:19,3
She got a photo in
the restaurant.


128
0:5:19,3 --> 0:5:20,38
I was so P'd off.


129
0:5:20,38 --> 0:5:22,3
But Sarah was actually
really in a hurry.


130
0:5:22,3 --> 0:5:24,8
She had to, like, get
ready and shit.


131
0:5:24,8 --> 0:5:26,875
Then she quickly went into a
restaurant for some champagne.


132
0:5:26,875 --> 0:5:28,34
I was like so P'd off
because they got a


133
0:5:28,34 --> 0:5:30,66
photo and I love her.

BILLIE JD PORTER: From the
first day we spent with


135
0:5:31,3 --> 0:5:34,3
Harvii, him and his cousin,
Cassie, took us to a hotel in


136
0:5:34,3 --> 0:5:37,42
Soho where we waited all day
for various celebrities.


137

Slowly, more of his friends
began to turn up, all of whom


138
0:5:40,38 --> 0:5:42,98
he had met through a shared
love of celeb hunting.

that Cassie was also a big

fan of Megan Fox.

a lotus flower.

And it's a beautiful flower.


176
0:6:46,76 --> 0:6:49,53
And M.F. is meant to
be for Megan Fox.


177
0:6:49,53 --> 0:6:51,21
Because I just love
Megan a lot.

And I just thought a
tattoo would always


179

It's a bit over the
top, maybe.

do you say when people

ask you about it?


185

wanted to, but if I didn't--

Anastasia, she's very down to
earth, very normal, or seems

to be, comes across that way.

nuts, a logical choice.

a pair of these with that and

maybe a t-shirt that I've
got of David Bowie.

my hair's really curly.

You know me because of my
Viva Forever tattoos.


404
0:17:40,8 --> 0:17:41,66
Remember, you signed it?


405
0:17:41,66 --> 0:17:43,99
And I have tattooed it on me.

0:17:43,99 --> 0:17:45,19
You saw it.


407
0:17:45,19 --> 0:17:48,69
So I have the others Spice
Girls tattoo it as well.

And I have been trying
hardly to meet them.


409
0:17:51,45 --> 0:17:55,92
So I can get my autographs
tattooed then so I can finish


410
0:17:55,92 --> 0:18:0,22
this tattoo thing and finally be
able to say I have done the


411
0:18:0,22 --> 0:18:3,72

the Spice Girls.

me if I can get this
help from you.

I've just come down from Knox


419
0:18:27,58 --> 0:18:31,6
again to get a tattoo which was
done on Saturday of Billy


420
0:18:31,6 --> 0:18:31,95

421
0:18:31,95 --> 0:18:34,51

he's just been playing at

weren't able to film the

in getting the


426
0:18:43,0 --> 0:18:45,21
tattoo signed.


427
0:18:45,21 --> 0:18:46,5
STEVE PORTER: He loved it.

0:18:46,5 --> 0:18:49,1
He loved it showing all the
management and everything.

really well.

STEVE PORTER: Yeah.


433
0:18:57,91 --> 0:19:0,18
It's them authenticating it.


434
0:19:0,18 --> 0:19:2,68
Saying that, yeah, I
like the tattoo.


435
0:19:2,68 --> 0:19:3,48

all about.

they don't sign it.

and Billy Conway took over.

0:19:24,832 --> 0:19:25,48
So yeah.

0:19:25,48 --> 0:19:28,28

next one if he finds
