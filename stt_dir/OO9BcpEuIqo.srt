0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,396



2
0:0:0,396 --> 0:0:3,635
NIMROD KAMER: The Sartorialist
is the most famous fashion


3
0:0:3,635 --> 0:0:5,21
blogger in history.


4
0:0:5,21 --> 0:0:8,5
It is my lifelong dream
to be on his blog.


5
0:0:8,5 --> 0:0:11,14
Because quintessentially, I'm
a piece of street art.


6
0:0:11,14 --> 0:0:12,32
You waiting for the book?


7
0:0:12,32 --> 0:0:13,48
-Yeah.


8
0:0:13,48 --> 0:0:15,84
NIMROD KAMER: You know it's 20
quid and it's just pictures of


9
0:0:15,84 --> 0:0:16,89
people in the streets.


10
0:0:16,89 --> 0:0:18,94
Are you a big fan of
the Sartorialist?


11
0:0:18,94 --> 0:0:19,43
-Yes.


12
0:0:19,43 --> 0:0:19,93
NIMROD KAMER: I love him.


13
0:0:19,93 --> 0:0:23,85
I think he's like redic
and unconvent hashtag.


14
0:0:23,85 --> 0:0:30,39
#fab, #marv, #immense,
#incred, OMG, WTF.


15
0:0:30,39 --> 0:0:33,9
Those girls were HAStags--


16
0:0:33,9 --> 0:0:35,245
hashtag for has-beens.


17
0:0:35,245 --> 0:0:37,16
Are you single?


18
0:0:37,16 --> 0:0:37,46
-Sorry?


19
0:0:37,46 --> 0:0:39,83
NIMROD KAMER: Are you single?


20
0:0:39,83 --> 0:0:40,253
-Single or singer?


21
0:0:40,253 --> 0:0:40,676
-Yeah, he's available.


22
0:0:40,676 --> 0:0:41,56
NIMROD KAMER: Single.


23
0:0:41,56 --> 0:0:43,71
I mean, emotionally available.


24
0:0:43,71 --> 0:0:44,996
-Emotionally?


25
0:0:44,996 --> 0:0:46,71
I'm not sure I'm emotionally
stable to


26
0:0:46,71 --> 0:0:48,42
be emotionally available.


27
0:0:48,42 --> 0:0:51,43
NIMROD KAMER: I'm into guys now,
because I want to be in


28
0:0:51,43 --> 0:0:54,385
the Sartorialist.


29
0:0:54,385 --> 0:0:56,72
Do you have any friends
on the book?


30
0:0:56,72 --> 0:0:57,51
I'm on it.


31
0:0:57,51 --> 0:0:58,0
-OK.


32
0:0:58,0 --> 0:1:5,5
NIMROD KAMER: Yeah, on page 16
if there wasn't a mistake.


33
0:1:5,5 --> 0:1:7,44
-You would need to pay for this
scarf in this department.


34
0:1:7,44 --> 0:1:9,22
NIMROD KAMER: Oh, I'm still
staying in the floor though.


35
0:1:9,22 --> 0:1:11,46
-That's all right, but you would
need to pay the scarf in


36
0:1:11,46 --> 0:1:11,89
this department.


37
0:1:11,89 --> 0:1:13,34
NIMROD KAMER: So I'll keep it
here for a sec, and I'll come


38
0:1:13,34 --> 0:1:13,95
back to pay.


39
0:1:13,95 --> 0:1:14,25
-I can hold it for you.


40
0:1:14,25 --> 0:1:14,47
That's fine.


41
0:1:14,47 --> 0:1:15,74
NIMROD KAMER: It goes
well with the book.


42
0:1:15,74 --> 0:1:17,48
I just want to have the look
for the book signing.


43
0:1:17,48 --> 0:1:17,79
-No problem.


44
0:1:17,79 --> 0:1:19,79
NIMROD KAMER: Because I just
want the blogger to like me.


45
0:1:19,79 --> 0:1:20,146
-Yeah.


46
0:1:20,146 --> 0:1:21,55
NIMROD KAMER: That's
his thing.


47
0:1:21,55 --> 0:1:22,865
Fashion street art.


48
0:1:22,865 --> 0:1:23,16
-I know.


49
0:1:23,16 --> 0:1:24,86
NIMROD KAMER: Hey, hello.


50
0:1:24,86 --> 0:1:25,7
My name is Nimrod.


51
0:1:25,7 --> 0:1:27,6
SCOTT SCHUMAN: Hi,
how are you?


52
0:1:27,6 --> 0:1:28,28
NIMROD KAMER: Like the
Green Day album.


53
0:1:28,28 --> 0:1:29,3
SCOTT SCHUMAN: Ah.


54
0:1:29,3 --> 0:1:29,75
NIMROD KAMER: Nimrod.


55
0:1:29,75 --> 0:1:32,4
Actually, instead of signing the
book, can you mention me


56
0:1:32,4 --> 0:1:32,94
on Twitter?


57
0:1:32,94 --> 0:1:34,2
SCOTT SCHUMAN: I don't know.


58
0:1:34,2 --> 0:1:35,9
I don't usually do that but
I can sign the book.


59
0:1:35,9 --> 0:1:36,56
NIMROD KAMER: But can you--


60
0:1:36,56 --> 0:1:36,78
SCOTT SCHUMAN: Is that fair?


61
0:1:36,78 --> 0:1:38,36
NIMROD KAMER: --put my name
on Twitter, like on


62
0:1:38,36 --> 0:1:40,955
your Twitter feed?


63
0:1:40,955 --> 0:1:41,825
SCOTT SCHUMAN: I don't know.


64
0:1:41,825 --> 0:1:42,7
I'll think about it.


65
0:1:42,7 --> 0:1:43,46
NIMROD KAMER: OK.


66
0:1:43,46 --> 0:1:46,19
And basically I have this
photo if you want to


67
0:1:46,19 --> 0:1:47,49
use it in your blog.


68
0:1:47,49 --> 0:1:48,56
Just go and consider it.


69
0:1:48,56 --> 0:1:49,56
It's me on a snowball.


70
0:1:49,56 --> 0:1:50,52
SCOTT SCHUMAN: I see that.


71
0:1:50,52 --> 0:1:50,78
NIMROD KAMER: Yeah.


72
0:1:50,78 --> 0:1:51,26
SCOTT SCHUMAN: Huh.


73
0:1:51,26 --> 0:1:52,3
NIMROD KAMER: Think about it.


74
0:1:52,3 --> 0:1:52,64
Yeah, you can leave it.


75
0:1:52,64 --> 0:1:54,416
SCOTT SCHUMAN: I'll put
it right there.


76
0:1:54,416 --> 0:1:56,296
NIMROD KAMER: And can
I follow you?


77
0:1:56,296 --> 0:1:57,4
SCOTT SCHUMAN: You what?


78
0:1:57,4 --> 0:1:57,58
NIMROD KAMER: Can
I follow you?


79
0:1:57,58 --> 0:1:58,52
SCOTT SCHUMAN: Sure.


80
0:1:58,52 --> 0:1:58,72
NIMROD KAMER: I mean follow--


81
0:1:58,72 --> 0:1:59,26
SCOTT SCHUMAN: You're welcome.


82
0:1:59,26 --> 0:2:1,332
NIMROD KAMER: Follow
you home, whatever?


83
0:2:1,332 --> 0:2:3,925
SCOTT SCHUMAN: Probably not
home, but we'll figure


84
0:2:3,925 --> 0:2:4,606
something out.


85
0:2:4,606 --> 0:2:5,6
NIMROD KAMER: OK.


86
0:2:5,6 --> 0:2:5,81
I love the tie.


87
0:2:5,81 --> 0:2:7,278
SCOTT SCHUMAN: Thank you.


88
0:2:7,278 --> 0:2:8,156
-Thank you very much.


89
0:2:8,156 --> 0:2:9,34
-So you bought it?


90
0:2:9,34 --> 0:2:10,119
NIMROD KAMER: I didn't buy it.


91
0:2:10,119 --> 0:2:11,83
I just took it from the
shelf, had it signed.


92
0:2:11,83 --> 0:2:14,37
And then actually I also tried
to sell it to someone else.


93
0:2:14,37 --> 0:2:17,64
Do you want to buy a book
from me with my


94
0:2:17,64 --> 0:2:22,465
signature for 25 quid?


95
0:2:22,465 --> 0:2:24,98
-So now you're waiting in
line to do it again?


96
0:2:24,98 --> 0:2:26,41
NIMROD KAMER: Yeah, to
sell it to another


97
0:2:26,41 --> 0:2:27,68
person for more money.


98
0:2:27,68 --> 0:2:28,78
Because you need to
make some money.


99
0:2:28,78 --> 0:2:30,16
I mean, all the money goes
to Sartorialist.


100
0:2:30,16 --> 0:2:30,77
You want to make some money.


101
0:2:30,77 --> 0:2:32,1
-But it's 5 quid!


102
0:2:32,1 --> 0:2:33,6
NIMROD KAMER: It's
profit for me.


103
0:2:33,6 --> 0:2:34,845
-I know, but that's
like $7 US.


104
0:2:34,845 --> 0:2:37,45
NIMROD KAMER: But I
do it 10 times.


105
0:2:37,45 --> 0:2:43,15
If you want to buy my book
signed for just 5 more quid.


106
0:2:43,15 --> 0:2:44,324
-Oh, OK.


107
0:2:44,324 --> 0:2:50,8



108
0:2:50,8 --> 0:2:52,905
NIMROD KAMER: Because he takes
advantage of the street, he


109
0:2:52,905 --> 0:2:55,99
should give back money to
the streets, basically.


110
0:2:55,99 --> 0:2:58,57
Can I just leave the book here
because I'm not sure I want it


111
0:2:58,57 --> 0:2:59,2
now?


112
0:2:59,2 --> 0:2:59,95
-But it's been signed?


113
0:2:59,95 --> 0:3:0,77
NIMROD KAMER: Yeah,
it's been signed.


114
0:3:0,77 --> 0:3:3,57
But I forgot to buy before, and
now I think I'm just going


115
0:3:3,57 --> 0:3:5,39
to leave it here if it's OK.


116
0:3:5,39 --> 0:3:6,18
-OK, yeah.


117
0:3:6,18 --> 0:3:6,654
I'm sure that's fine.


118
0:3:6,654 --> 0:3:6,97
Have a good day.


119
0:3:6,97 --> 0:3:8,305
NIMROD KAMER: But you can
use the signature.


120
0:3:8,305 --> 0:3:11,32



121
0:3:11,32 --> 0:3:12,1
NIMROD KAMER: No.


122
0:3:12,1 --> 0:3:13,58
I mean, I don't have the book.


123
0:3:13,58 --> 0:3:16,11
I had it signed, and
then I left it.


124
0:3:16,11 --> 0:3:19,7



125
0:3:19,7 --> 0:3:21,945
NIMROD KAMER: Yeah, because I
just had it signed, and then I


126
0:3:21,945 --> 0:3:24,29
just regretted it.


127
0:3:24,29 --> 0:3:24,42
NIMROD KAMER: I can't resell?


128
0:3:24,42 --> 0:3:25,67
OK, OK.


129
0:3:25,67 --> 0:5:25,67
