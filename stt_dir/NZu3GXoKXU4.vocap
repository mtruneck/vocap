###2 The story of Noah building an ark to save his family
###6 and save thousands of animals
###7 from a flood which destroys all life on earth
###10 is an epic from many people's childhoods.
###15 It's a wonderful story, found in the Bible,
###17 The Koran and the Torah.
###19 But is it in fact, real history?
###24 Now the technology exists
###26 to examine this well known epic
###27 with the eyes of science.
###31 We will weigh out the evidence
###32 from archaeological finds in Iraq...
###37 We will examine the proof
###38 that a global flood did cover the whole planet...
###43 We'll also create a historically accurate picture
###46 of the real Noah: who he was, where he lived
###49 and what he might have looked like.
###74 The story of Noah is told in the Book of Genesis
###77 in the Bible and the Torah.
###79 It's set somewhere in the middle-east
###81 about 5000 years ago.
###85 Noah's family includes his wife,
###87 his three sons - Shem, Ham and Japheth,
###90 and their brides.
###94 Noah stands out as a good person -
###96 the only virtuous man left in a world
###99 that had become filled with corruption and violence.
###106 He is described as a wine-grower,
###108 a claim that has an authentic ring to it
###110 as wine was grown in the middle east
###113 as far back as 3000BC.
###116 And this reference also provides
###118 a rare insight into Noah's character.
###122 After the flood, the Bible says Noah planted the first vineyard.
###125 But it also tells us that Noah had a weakness
###133 Having made the first wine,
###134 the story goes that Noah drank too much of it.
###139 In fact, one night this Holy Man
###141 collapses naked and drunk.
###158 Horrified his sons
###160 Ham and Shem cover their father.
###171 In the morning, Noah is embarrassed -
###172 and perhaps suffering the first ever hangover -
###175 he curses the sons who saw him naked.
###180 He sound like a flawed and complex man
###182 but perhaps that is true of all great men.
###192 But Noah was probably a very reliable man,
###195 because God gives him a very big mission.
###198 The story goes that God warned Noah in a dream
###201 that he was going to punish humanity for its sins
###203 with a flood that would cover the whole earth.
###210 To save Noah and his family
###211 God told him to build a boat of wood
###214 and to line it with pitch inside and out.
###218 He also ordered Noah to give the ark three decks,
###220 a roof and a door.
###225 But the most surprising of God's instructions
###227 was the sheer size of the Ark.
###231 The Bible spells it out- in cubits.
###234 Traditionally a cubit was the length of a man's forearm -
###238 about one and a half feet.
###241 The Bible says Noah built an Ark 300 cubits long
###244 and 50 cubits wide by 30 high.
###248 That's almost as big as modern super tankers
###250 and cruise liners like Titanic.
###265 Nearly 450 feet long,
###267 it would have been a magnificent sight -
###270 certainly the biggest boat in the ancient world.
###277 quite an achievement for an ordinary man
###284 Now the Bible assumes
###285 it was possible to build
###287 this monster vessel out of wood alone.
###290 It's a pretty big assumption.
###303 The familiar image from the story books
###304 and cartoons of our childhood
###306 is of a huge wooden ark
###307 with the animals marching inside two by two.
###311 But that is a 19TH Century image.
###314 It is completely at odds
###315 with what could be built in Biblical times.
###319 According to Tom Vosmer,
###321 an expert on ancient boats,
###322 not even 19TH century engineers
###324 could have built a 450 ft Ark out of wood alone.
###329 They had to use steel frames
###331 inside much smaller wooden boats
###333 just to keep them afloat.
###337 The problem with a 450 foot boat made of wood
###341 is that the wood as a material
###344 cannot maintain the shape of the boat
###347 and the boat would start to distort at sea,
###350 and the seams would open up
###351 and it would sink.
###356 It's a safe bet that the huge Ark
###358 would spring hundreds of leaks along the length
###360 of its huge hull and sink like a stone.
###374 That's not to say Noah didn't build an ark.
###377 It's just that it would have been much smaller.
###382 Then there's another problem.
###384 How could he cram two
###385 of every different kind of animal into the ark?
###397 At the latest estimate,
###398 there are 30 million species on earth.
###403 Even with a fleet of Arks,
###405 Noah would have struggled to fit them all in.
###409 And how would he have gotten the animals on board.
###414 Did he personally go and fetch them?
###416 Or did they come to him?
###420 It is something Noah would have had to consider
###422 especially since he had a pressing deadline.
###427 Noah had just seven days to find all the animals
###431 and get them on board.
###435 30 million species in a week.
###438 Noah would have needed to load them
###439 at the rate of 50 pairs a second.
###443 But if one assumes a more realistic loading rate then
###446 it would have taken Noah at least 30 years.
###462 It may seem like there's a stark choice:
###466 dismiss the story as myth,
###467 or appeal to the hand of God.
###471 But there may in fact be another explanation.
###476 The instruction to load 'all the animals'
###478 could have referred only to all the animals
###480 in Noah's part of the world.
###484 In fact, the Book of Genesis specifies
###487 which animals Noah was to load.
###493 The same book has a second set of instructions
###496 which are much less well known
###497 but present an even more realistic scenario.
###501 Noah is told to take 'take seven pairs
###503 of clean animals'.
###506 Clean animals were those considered suitable
###508 for ceremonial sacrifices to God.
###516 The Books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy
###518 specify 10 such species
###519 including several types of sheep,
###521 antelopes plus cattle,
###523 goats and deer.
###525 Seven pairs of 10 species
###530 That's 140 animals.
###535 Then Noah is directed to take a pair
###537 of each impure animal and bird.
###540 Again, The books of Leviticus
###542 and Deuteronomy list 30 or more.
###545 They include the pig, the hare,
###547 the lizard, the snail and so on.
###551 That's a further 60 animals.
###556 Then finally, Noah is told
###557 to load 'seven pairs of the clean birds -
###561 like doves, ducks and cockerels.
###565 Adding all that up, Noah had 260 animals.
###571 That's child's play compared to 30 million -
###575 especially if you discount the elephants,
###578 kangaroos and reluctant camels!
###587 A smaller Ark and fewer animals -
###590 suddenly the Noah story looks more plausible.
###595 But the next part of the story
###596 may be most far fetched of all.
###602 Noah, the Ark, and the animals
###604 It's all meaningless without the worst cataclysm
###607 in human history - the flood.
###625 According to the Bible
###626 it rained until the whole world was covered in water.
###634 Such a catastrophe should have left evidence
###636 all over the planet
###638 in the form of uniform marine sediments
###640 spread across the earth and the ocean floor.
###646 But have geologists found any proof
###649 of a devastating global flood?
###660 The scientific quest
###661 for traces of the Biblical global flood
###663 that Noah, his family and the animals in the ark
###666 survived actually began more than 150 years ago.
###672 But geologist Ian Plimer,
###674 after searching across continents
###676 sometimes in the most extreme weather conditions
###679 has found very little evidence.
###683 A great flood would leave a signature.
###685 It would be a very very large signature
###688 apparent all over the world.
###690 There is no such signature.
###692 There's no evidence,
###693 in fact there is only overwhelming evidence
###696 to the contrary.
###698 The absence of direct evidence
###700 is only one of the problems with the story
###703 The whole idea of a global flood flies
###706 in the face of what is known about planet earth.
###710 To flood the entire planet
###712 to the top of the Himalayas would take three times
###715 the volume of water in the oceans.
###719 It's hard to imagine
###720 where such a deluge could come from.
###722 The Bible provides some clues.
###726 It says it rained for forty days and forty nights -
###731 but even non-stop that's not enough.
###736 We know how much water we've got in the oceans,
###739 we know how much water's in the polar ice caps.
###742 We know how much water is in the atmosphere
###744 and we know how much water is in the rocks.
###747 If we put all of that together,
###748 which has happened many times in the geological past,
###751 we still do not flood the continents.
###768 If rainfall couldn't deliver enough water,
###771 what could?
###772 The Bible offers one more possibility -
###777 'deep springs'.
###780 The Book of Genesis says ''
###781 All the springs of the great deep broke through''
###786 Could the great flood have gushed out
###788 of the centre of the earth?
###797 It's an impossibility to have that much amount of water
###800 coming out of springs, fountains or geysers.
###805 If all of that water was in the earth and in the crust
###809 then well before it had been released as geysers
###812 the crust would have been quicksand,
###814 you couldn't have walked.
###818 Even if the flood had been caused by a miracle
###820 Noah, his family and the animals
###822 would have faced further problems...
###826 The amount of water flooding the surface of the planet
###828 would have changed the earth's atmosphere.
###836 The atmosphere would have had a huge amount
###839 of water vapour dissolved in it,
###841 so much so that you would have drowned by breathing.
###845 And so much so that atmospheric pressure
###847 would have crushed your lungs.
###851 Geysers present another potentially fatal problem.
###854 They release poisonous gases
###856 from deep within the earth's core
###857 which probably would have killed everybody,
###859 whether or not they were in the Ark.
###863 Geysers pump out huge amounts
###865 of noxious sulphur rich gasses.
###867 Even before the flood
###869 you could not have breathed.
###886 If nothing on Earth could cause the flood -
###889 how about something from space.
###891 Like a comet.
###894 They contain vast amounts of frozen water.
###901 But to flood the entire planet
###903 the comet would have to be 1000 miles wide,
###906 or as big as Brazil.
###910 And if a comet that size hit the earth,
###912 not many people would live to worry about a flood.
###917 The friction caused by the comet's forced entry
###920 into the earth's outer atmosphere
###922 and its impact as it struck earth
###924 would be equivalent to 12 trillion megatons of TNT -
###934 the biggest explosion of all time
###939 Comets carry water, they are dirty ice.
###942 As they come into the atmosphere, they explode,
###945 there are massive shock waves.
###950 Massive areas of forest wiped out,
###955 huge extinctions of life from a comet
###960 The comet's devastating impact
###962 would force the temperature of the atmosphere
###964 to rise to 12000 degrees Fahrenheit -
###971 hotter than the surface of the sun.
###978 We would have had no life to go onto an Ark.
###985 Noah, his family
###987 and all the animals two by two
###989 would have been fried to charcoal
###991 before the whole flood started
###1003 End of story?
###1005 Not quite.
###1014 According to the Bible,
###1016 Noah's Ark landed in the mountains of Ararat,
###1018 today in Eastern Turkey.
###1022 The earth was revealed at last
###1024 and the animals disembarked
###1026 after months below decks to repopulate the world.
###1033 So are there any remains of the ark?
###1038 The problem is that the evidence -
###1040 wood, rots in a matter of centuries.
###1059 Countless expeditions have been drawn to Mount Ararat
###1062 seeking to discover the ark's resting place.
###1066 There are no obvious remains of the ark
###1068 on the slopes of Mount Ararat
###1073 This hasn't stopped a thriving tourist industry -
###1076 pilgrims, ark hunters and locals -
###1078 convinced that they will find the remains
###1080 of the Ark somewhere on the mountain.
###1086 One French expedition in the 50s
###1088 did in fact find an ancient looking piece of wood
###1091 12000 ft up in a glacier.
###1098 As a geologist,
###1099 Ian Plimer wanted to find out more.
###1103 He knew that for the timber to be part of Noah's Ark,
###1106 it would need to be dated to around 3000BC.
###1112 When this piece of wood was found
###1114 it was thought to be the clue,
###1116 this is what we need to show we have Noah's Ark
###1119 and so they took the wood to date it
###1122 and you can date wood
###1123 by measuring tree rings or by carbon dating.
###1128 It wasn't old enough.
###1130 The wood was from the eighth century,
###1132 4000 years after Noah's time.
###1135 But what was the wood doing on the slopes of Ararat?
###1139 The wood would have been transported there
###1141 to build a structure -
###1142 something like a church.
###1143 There is a booming ark business there now,
###1146 there was in the past.
###1147 It certainly didn't come from Noah
###1151 But just as Ararat
###1153 was looking like a false trail for ark hunters,
###1155 this ancient mountain came up with a new twist.
###1164 In 1949, US Air Force planes
###1167 photographed the summit of Mt Ararat.
###1171 Rumours began to spread
###1172 that they'd spotted a boat structure in the ice.
###1177 For decades the CIA withheld the pictures.
###1183 But then through the Freedom of Information
###1185 Act the CIA finally released the photos in 1995.
###1193 At first there's nothing
###1195 in the CIA picture to suggest a boat.
###1199 But look closely,
###1200 you can see a huge dark shape
###1202 sticking out of the ice-cap.
###1204 It's about 450 feet long -
###1207 the right length for the Ark.
###1210 The anomaly has tantalised ark hunters
###1212 since the pictures were released.
###1214 But geologists remain unconvinced.
###1219 It's such a poor quality grainy image
###1223 that it's very hard to tell whether it's an Ark or chicken entrails.
###1228 You can see dark shapes anywhere from the air,
###1230 be they in ice or on the ground.
###1233 Some of them are ark shaped, others are not.
###1235 It's not at all convincing
###1237 from one single poor quality photograph.
###1241 But hopes were raised again in the year 2000
###1244 with new pin-sharp satellite images of the strange shape.
###1248 This one shows a snow ledge
###1250 believed by ark hunters to conceal a boat-shaped outline.
###1254 But for Ian Plimer this is just another
###1256 of nature's random shapes.
###1260 Well this is a fabulous photograph
###1261 Far better resolution than the CIA photograph.
###1264 However we see nothing spectacular here.
###1267 All we see is evidence of retreating and advancing ice
###1273 In fact, all the geological evidence indicates
###1276 that an ark could not have remained frozen
###1279 in a glacier for long.
###1281 The ice is constantly pushing material
###1284 I down the slopes of Mount Ararat
###1285 and ultimately taken any ark
###1288 that might have been there to the bottom.
###1290 It would have spat it out as all glaciers do,
###1293 as they move down slope
###1295 anything they pick up they spit out.
###1297 Be it rocks, be it Arks.
###1303 In addition to fragments of wood and photos
###1305 there are dozens of alleged sightings of the ark.
###1310 Biblical scholar Lloyd Bailey has made
###1312 an exhaustive analysis of all the claims
###1314 and found them to be false.
###1318 An amazing amount of evidence
###1320 has been produced by ark searchers
###1322 in support of the ark having landed there.
###1325 But photographs are alleged to exist
###1328 but you can't find them.
###1329 Newspaper articles of sightings
###1331 are alleged to exist but they are lost.
###1335 They want desperately to be able to support the Bible
###1338 in an age of doubt, in a modern rational age.
###1343 And that desire is so strong
###1345 they can rationalise away
###1347 the overwhelming evidence that there is no boat there
###1350 and no evidence whatsoever that there ever has been.
###1356 The traditional Noah story
###1357 may not pass a rational historical test.
###1361 But maybe it was never meant to.
###1373 Biblical scholars - using clues in the language
###1376 used by the Bible -
###1377 are agreed that the story of Noah
###1379 was physically written down
###1380 in the 6th century BC.
###1384 The scribes who wrote it were Jewish priests
###1387 who were in exile in Babylon -
###1389 today modern Iraq.
###1393 Maybe they sat down one day to make up
###1395 a cautionary tale about what happens
###1398 when people disobey God.
###1402 But it's said
###1404 that all stories have some seeds of truth.
###1408 Maybe the Noah story is an exaggeration,
###1412 an embellishment of something that really happened.
###1419 150 years ago,
###1421 archaeologists made some extraordinary finds
###1424 in Iraq.
###1425 Evidence that would re-write the famous story about Noah
###1428 and his ark full of animals.
###1446 In 1851,
###1447 British archaeologist Sir Henry Layard
###1449 explored the ruins
###1450 of the Babylonian library of Ninevah.
###1470 His finds were a breakthrough -
###1472 hundreds of clay tablets -
###1474 of all sizes and shapes.
###1478 They may have held vital clues
###1480 about the Noah story.
###1483 The trouble was,
###1484 Sir Henry couldn't decipher the ancient Babylonian script.
###1489 So he packed the tablets
###1491 and sent them off to London -
###1492 to the British Museum -
###1494 to be deciphered by experts.
###1506 The museum staff had no idea about
###1508 the sensational information encrypted in the tablets.
###1513 So they languished in their vaults for years
###1516 until 1872
###1518 when they came to the attention
###1519 of museum assistant George Smith.
###1525 Dr Irving Finkel today runs the department
###1527 in the British Museum
###1529 where George Smith worked.
###1532 Smith had a peculiar quality tantamount to genius
###1536 which meant he could look at a cuneiform tablet
###1538 and know what it was about,
###1539 more than anybody else
###1540 before him and probably anybody else since.
###1542 And he wasn't a trained phrenologist,
###1544 he know a bit of Hebrew, he knew a bit of Arabic,
###1546 he could look things up in the dictionary
###1547 but he just had this amazing quality that
###1549 he could look at a bit of clay
###1551 which to everybody else looks like a dog biscuit
###1553 and know what the words meant.
###1554 And he was the person in our Department
###1556 who read about the flood for the first time.
###1560 What George Smith discovered among the tablets
###1562 was an ancient story about a great flood -
###1565 the Epic of Gilgamesh.
###1567 It was a breakthrough Smith himself
###1569 could barely comprehend.
###1571 The impact on him was something
###1574 that he could hardly control.
###1576 He dropped the tablet back into the tray like this,
###1579 and started to run holding his head
###1581 and making funny noises
###1583 and according to the narrative that is recorded
###1585 he started even to take his clothes off in his agitation
###1588 because he was the first person after all that time,
###1590 to read this funny writing and see that
###1592 there was to all intents and purposes the text
###1595 that everybody knew from the Bible
###1596 and it was just too much for him to tolerate,
###1598 he just nearly went crazy.
###1602 What seemed to upset him so much were the similarities
###1605 between the stories of Gilgamesh and Noah
###1612 ''The great gods decided to make a deluge ''
###1621 ''Build a boat...''
###1626 ''Take into the boat the seed of all living things...''
###1640 Irving Finkel has a theory
###1642 why George Smith behaved so oddly that fateful day.
###1646 The sheer excitement might have triggered
###1648 some sort of brain seizure.
###1651 I was reading something about the history of epilepsy where
###1653 this phenomenon was described
###1655 as a particular kind of epilepsy,
###1657 making this funny noise
###1658 and trying to disrobe yourself in the agitation
###1660 of having an epileptic fit of some kind,
###1663 And it did occur to me
###1664 to wonder whether shock that hit him,
###1667 the real shock might not have triggered
###1669 something of that kind.
###1683 Since then yet more accounts of the flood story
###1686 were unearthed in Iraq -
###1687 confirming that the story first emerged
###1689 in ancient Mesopotamia -
###1691 the place where the great Sumerian,
###1692 Assyrian and Babylonian civilisations were born.
###1700 The ancient flood stories had different names
###1703 and were written at different times
###1706 but they all pointed to a common ancestor
###1709 composed some 5000 years ago -
###1712 one original story about a disastrous flood.
###1717 It is very likely that the biblical story
###1720 has a Mesopotamian prototype
###1723 because they are so similar,
###1725 in both cases the gods have decided
###1727 to destroy the human race
###1728 they do so by a great flood,
###1731 one family survives in a boat,
###1733 they take on board animals,
###1735 they disembark and then they repopulate the earth.
###1739 One of the oldest flood narratives -
###1741 The epic of Atra-hasis
###1742 written before the more famous epic of Gilgamesh -
###1745 was discovered only recently.
###1748 Alan Millard found it while sifting through
###1750 the British Museum's backlog of clay tablets.
###1753 It made him wonder -
###1754 perhaps the Bible never meant a global deluge.
###1759 The ancient Hebrew language has one word for land
###1763 and country and earth and it's easy to suppose
###1768 that means the whole earth
###1769 but it certainly need not.
###1771 And I think that it was a local flood
###1774 that is described there.
###1779 The discovery of these older versions
###1781 of Noah's story raised a tantalising possibility.
###1785 What if they had been inspired by an actual flood?
###1788 Not a global deluge,
###1790 but a regional flood in Mesopotamia?
###1795 In the 1930s
###1797 archaeologists returned to Iraq to find out.
###1813 In 1931,
###1815 a team of archaeologists
###1816 led by Leonard Woolley and his wife Katherine
###1819 were excavating the ruins
###1820 of the ancient Mesopotamian city of Ur.
###1827 The Woolleys were a colourful husband and wife team -
###1829 friends of Lawrence of Arabia -
###1831 and of Agatha Christie the novelist.
###1838 They left a detailed record of their finds
###1841 revealing that they dug five to six thousand years
###1844 into the past -
###1845 the right time frame for the Noah story.
###1853 One day his workmen struck
###1855 an unusual layer of soil -
###1857 one that could only have been deposited
###1859 by water.
###1863 When the soil was analysed
###1865 it showed that the silt
###1866 had been deposited by river water.
###1870 Now, Mesopotamia suffered regular seasonal floods.
###1874 But this was a massive layer -
###1877 something out of the ordinary.
###1884 In fact, later archaeological excavations
###1887 of ancient city streets
###1888 show that five thousand years ago
###1890 at least three Mesopotamian towns
###1893 were hit by large river floods.
###1900 So Leonard Woolley and his wife
###1902 had hit the jackpot.
###1905 There had been a massive flood
###1907 in ancient Mesopotamia after all.
###1909 It was - conclusive proof - a real story
###1913 lay behind the Biblical and Babylonian epics
###1927 In committing the story to writing,
###1929 the Sumerian scribes may have embellished it
###1931 with myths and supernatural events.
###1934 But there are plenty of practical details too,
###1937 and they are priceless in reconstructing a story
###1940 that's historically plausible.
###1944 However, it does mean starting afresh
###1952 It means setting aside
###1954 the storybook image of the huge Ark,
###1959 the global deluge,
###1961 the number of animals
###1964 and the landing on Mt Ararat.
###1968 Above all it means abandoning
###1971 the familiar Biblical image of Noah,
###1973 and introducing a very different image
###1975 of what he might have actually looked like
###1977 and how he might have lived.
###1985 Archaeological finds have established
###1987 that the Noah story may actually have happened in Sumeria -
###1991 an ancient civilisation in what is now Iraq.
###1996 The Babylonian accounts say
###1998 that the story begins in the city of Shuruppak.
###2002 This was the cradle of civilisation.
###2007 The Sumerians invented writing,
###2009 the wheel and accounting.
###2014 And what is known of Sumerian culture
###2015 offers the first glimpse of the historical figure
###2018 behind the flood stories.
###2022 The most obvious difference is how Noah looked.
###2025 Forget the man in Biblical robes
###2027 and imagine instead a Sumerian from head to toe -
###2031 wearing eye make-up,
###2032 with a bald head and even a kilt!
###2037 Then there's what he did for a living.
###2040 The Epic of Gilgamesh says
###2041 the Sumerian Noah owned silver and gold.
###2045 Five thousand years ago,
###2046 these were the currency of wealthy merchants,
###2049 suggesting that the Sumerian Noah
###2051 was not a farmer or a wine grower
###2053 but a businessman.
###2057 Instead of an Ark to survive the flood,
###2059 the Sumerian Noah is more likely
###2061 to have built a boat to make money -
###2064 hauling grain, beer and animals.
###2071 All the big trading centres -
###2073 like the great city of Ur -
###2074 lay on the Euphrates.
###2076 It was cheaper to take cargo on river barges
###2079 than by overland caravans.
###2096 The question is how big a barge
###2098 did this Noah have?
###2101 The Sumerians used a variety of boats on the Euphrates,
###2105 from small reed canoes,
###2106 to wooden ones 20 feet long.
###2109 But the Babylonian sources agree
###2111 the flood boat was much bigger than those.
###2116 There was an obvious incentive for merchants
###2118 to build the biggest commercial river barge possible.
###2122 But they would have been limited by the technology available.
###2127 No remains or inscriptions of large Sumerian boats
###2130 have been found yet.
###2132 So instead marine archaeologists
###2135 have asked how big a boat
###2136 could the Sumerians have built
###2138 with the available know how?
###2151 One simple solution
###2152 would have been to tie smaller boats together.
###2157 Marine archaeologist Tom Vosmer believes
###2159 there are clues to this effect in the Epic of Gilgamesh.
###2164 It says that the boat was divided in sections.
###2168 Probably one of the best ways to do
###2170 it would be to build it in units such as the size of this,
###2174 and use it as a pontoon
###2176 in a river barge actually held together,
###2180 lash them together, with some rope and heavy timbers
###2183 and then they could build the ark on top of that.
###2186 And it was probably a system
###2187 that could have been used on the rivers quite easily.
###2201 Since the historical Ark was a cargo vessel,
###2204 it's easy to say what the Sumerian Noah
###2206 loaded on to his barge.
###2211 Forget the animals marching two by two
###2213 and think instead of Noah loading animals,
###2217 grain and beer for sale.
###2222 Even for a rich merchant,
###2224 it's quite an undertaking
###2225 to mastermind such a big construction.
###2228 But according to the Babylonian sources,
###2231 Noah had more than just wealth on his side.
###2244 They say Noah was the king of the city of Shuruppak,
###2249 but he wasn't above the law.
###2251 Failure to deliver his cargo
###2253 would have meant social and financial ruin for Noah,
###2256 whether he was king or not.
###2259 In Sumeria anyone who failed to pay their debts -
###2262 including kings -
###2264 was liable to end up as a slave.
###2269 But how did the flood come into it?
###2272 The most likely answer
###2274 is that Noah was caught out
###2275 by a freak combination of natural events.
###2280 Parts of the Euphrates were only navigable
###2282 when river levels were at their peak.
###2285 That meant Noah would have
###2286 had to time his departure carefully.
###2289 That meant waiting for the melt waters.
###2315 Melting snow from the Armenian mountains
###2317 increased the flow of the Euphrates in July.
###2320 Records indicate that only then
###2322 were the river channels deep enough for large vessels.
###2330 But there was a risk.
###2334 If Shuruppak was hit by a freak storm
###2336 just at the moment that river levels
###2338 were at their highest,
###2339 then the peaceful waters of the Euphrates
###2341 could turn into a raging flood.
###2345 But the average rainfall
###2346 in dry years in July was zero.
###2351 The odds on a catastrophic river flood
###2353 in Mesopotamia would have been remote
###2355 about one in every 1000 years.
###2359 So if it happened
###2361 it should have been worth writing about
###2369 The Babylonian tablets say that on the day of the flood,
###2372 Noah and his family
###2373 were having a banquet on the barge.
###2377 Then the weather suddenly
###2378 began to change for the worse -
###2381 a freak storm was beginning
###2382 and a catastrophic flood was on its way.
###2389 A storm that would threaten Noah's very survival.
###2409 If a flash flood was big enough
###2411 to sweep away Noah's ark
###2413 and put his life in danger
###2414 it would have began with rainfall of tropical intensity
###2417 in the mountains where the rivers rise.
###2422 Mesopotamia isn't in the tropics,
###2424 but there's evidence that hurricanes
###2426 and tropical storms could get that far.
###2433 Some 6000 years ago
###2435 it was much warmer and wetter
###2437 and it would be no surprise whatsoever
###2439 to get a tropical storm.
###2442 we could have had ten times the rainfall Some
###2446 of these metereological events are absolutely catastrophic,
###2450 and these are the sort of events
###2451 that we record in history -
###2453 we don't record the normal day to day humdrum
###2460 If a freak storm
###2461 coincided with the seasonal snow melt,
###2464 then the Euphrates could easily
###2467 have flooded the Mesopotamian plain.
###2495 The Bible says the storm lasted
###2496 for an incredible 40 days.
###2499 The Babylonian tablets say it was 7.
###2504 But even a single day
###2506 would have been terrible, life threatening.
###2514 With much of his cargo left behind or swept away,
###2517 Noah's barge would have been
###2519 at the mercy of the raging Euphrates.
###2560 The following day say the Babylonian tablets,
###2562 Noah and his family couldn't see land.
###2566 The flood extended for miles.
###2573 After the storm, Noah and his family
###2575 must have longed for the waters to subside,
###2577 and ground them on the banks of the Euphrates.
###2582 In fact, their problems had only just begun.
###2589 All versions of the story agree
###2591 that they couldn't see land for at least seven days.
###2594 The Bible concludes that Noah's flood
###2596 covered the whole world.
###2599 But there is in fact another explanation.
###2605 Noah's family would have believed
###2606 that they were drifting on the flooded Euphrates.
###2609 They would have been relieved
###2610 that at the very least the river water meant
###2612 they wouldn't die of thirst.
###2618 But the Babylonian versions suggest
###2621 that the water was salty.
###2634 Noah's ark, was no longer drifting
###2636 on the flooded Euphrates
###2641 If you plot Noah's course from Shuruppak -
###2643 now in the flooded plain -
###2645 the currents would have swept his barge
###2647 downstream into the Persian Gulf!
###2651 This tallies with the epic of Gilgamesh
###2654 which says that the he ''looked upon the sea''.
###2663 There's no telling how long Noah and his family
###2665 would have stayed marooned in the Persian Gulf.
###2668 The Bible records more than a year,
###2671 the Babylonian tablets suggest just a week.
###2677 Either way - Noah and his family
###2679 had a big problem: salty water.
###2682 What would they drink?
###2686 Without freshwater from rain or river,
###2689 their only alternative would have been the beer
###2691 they were carrying for their traders.
###2694 Beer is actually a good alternative.
###2697 And we know we had it three and half thousand years ago.
###2700 They were brewing beer,
###2704 it's full of nutrients,
###2706 most important it's sterile
###2708 and wouldn't suffer from contamination
###2710 like water might.
###2724 One of the hallmarks of the Noah story
###2726 is that the Ark is said to have landed
###2728 in the mountains of Ararat.
###2732 But if there was no global flood
###2734 then it's far more likely
###2735 that it landed somewhere else altogether.
###2741 The mountains of Ararat
###2742 lie to the north of Shuruppak.
###2745 Swept downriver,
###2746 the barge would have grounded 500 miles away
###2749 on the shores of the Persian Gulf.
###2751 In the Bible once the ark
###2753 has grounded the story is almost over.
###2756 But the Babylonian tablets
###2758 hint that Noah's adventure was far from over
###2766 There are several puzzling references -
###2768 one talks of 'the overthrowing of his kingship',
###2771 another says the flood hero was 'expelled'.
###2780 All of these references clearly suggest
###2782 that for some reason,
###2783 Noah couldn't return to Shuruppak -
###2785 that even when the flood was over,
###2787 he was still in mortal danger
###2792 The most likely explanation
###2794 is that many of Noah's creditors
###2796 had survived the deluge,
###2797 had tracked him down
###2799 and were now demanding their money back.
###2804 Under Sumerian law
###2805 Noah could be forced into slavery
###2807 to repay his debts.
###2810 He would have had to flee the country to avoid prosecution.
###2818 Precisely where the fugitive
###2820 Noah went is something of a mystery.
###2822 One of the Babylonian tablets says
###2824 that Noah went to live in a land called Dilmun.
###2830 Now that's the Sumerian name
###2831 for the modern island of Bahrain.
###2834 Maybe this is where he came to rest.
###2843 That is where, after the flood was over,
###2847 the Babylonian Noah was settled by the gods.
###2850 Apparently it was a pleasant place to be
###2853 where he could exist without much work
###2855 and pass the time away as he pleased.
###2859 If he did end up in Dilmun,
###2862 then the modern island of Bahrain
###2864 may have a remarkable secret.
###2872 Its landscape is dotted
###2874 with hundreds of thousands of burial mounds.
###2877 And only a handful of these tombs
###2878 have been excavated.
###2881 But many date back to Sumerian times.
###2884 They are the sort of place a great king
###2887 would be laid to rest in.
###2895 In time the memory of a king
###2897 who survived a flood
###2899 could have been turned into a great Sumerian legend.
###2903 It would have been embellished
###2904 with miraculous and mythological elements.
###2912 Eventually it would have been written down,
###2915 copied and recopied by generations of scribes,
###2918 giving rise to new versions.
###2927 Two thousand years later,
###2929 one of those versions,
###2931 languishing in a library in Babylon
###2933 could also have come to the attention
###2934 of the Jewish priests who wrote the Bible.
###2938 When they first read the story,
###2940 how could they fail to recognise the lessons it offers.
###2945 If humankind falls short of God's laws
###2949 there's a dreadful price to pay.
###2953 Behind that moral message
###2955 lies one of the world's great stories.
###2959 And behind that story
###2961 we can just glimpse a real man,
###2965 a real boat, and a real adventure.
