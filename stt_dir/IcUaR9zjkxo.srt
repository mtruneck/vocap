1
0:0:3,167 --> 0:0:5,847
You ever notice how a tumour
looks just like cheese?


2
0:0:5,847 --> 0:0:7,967
ls that good cocktail conversation?


3
0:0:7,967 --> 0:0:10,767
This patient today
thought he had blood in his stool.


4
0:0:10,767 --> 0:0:14,647
Turned out to be pimento.


5
0:0:14,647 --> 0:0:17,927
What? l worked on a homeless
guy who vomited up a mitten.


6
0:0:17,927 --> 0:0:20,607
That won't stop me
from wearing mine when it's cold.


7
0:0:20,607 --> 0:0:24,687
What's wrong with you? We have
a good bottle of wine, we all look nice.


8
0:0:24,687 --> 0:0:29,527
Can we talk about something
other than work? Please?


9
0:0:29,527 --> 0:0:31,7
Name an actress.


10
0:0:31,7 --> 0:0:33,887
JD can tell you which movie
she appeared in naked.


11
0:0:33,887 --> 0:0:36,87
l'm gonna go put on my pyjamas.


12
0:0:36,87 --> 0:0:38,407
Can't believe
l shaved my legs for this.


13
0:0:38,407 --> 0:0:40,767
Drew Barrymore, Meg Ryan,
Jennifer Connelly.


14
0:0:40,767 --> 0:0:43,207
<i>Boys on the Side The Doors</i>
and as for Ms Connelly,


15
0:0:43,207 --> 0:0:46,447
topless in <i>Inventing the Abbotts</i>
bottomless in <i>Requiem For a Dream</i>


16
0:0:46,447 --> 0:0:48,767
and in <i>The Hot Spot</i>
you gotta love her,


17
0:0:48,767 --> 0:0:51,407
frontal and tush-tush.


18
0:0:51,407 --> 0:0:54,607
- Oh, my God!
- You the man.


19
0:0:54,607 --> 0:0:58,247
<i>That's the thing about</i>
<i>best friends, They just get each other,</i>


20
0:0:58,247 --> 0:1:2,207
You usually get uncomfortable
hugging a guy right about now.


21
0:1:2,207 --> 0:1:3,967
Bring it, baby.


22
0:1:3,967 --> 0:1:9,7
This isn't gonna end well.
l used to wrestle in college.


23
0:1:9,7 --> 0:1:11,407
Oh! You broke the hug!


24
0:1:11,407 --> 0:1:13,567
So you working
on a house or what?


25
0:1:13,567 --> 0:1:17,767
Yeah, l scored this
big restoration job.


26
0:1:17,767 --> 0:1:19,167
So who's the fan club?


27
0:1:19,167 --> 0:1:20,927
Neat hug.


28
0:1:20,927 --> 0:1:23,87
Newbie, no one likes a looky-loo.


29
0:1:23,87 --> 0:1:25,7
Not now, not ever.


30
0:1:25,7 --> 0:1:27,487
What's that,
your lucky board or something?


31
0:1:27,487 --> 0:1:29,727
That? Oh, that's a nail gun accident.


32
0:1:29,727 --> 0:1:31,487
Oh, my God, that's disgusting.


33
0:1:31,487 --> 0:1:35,7
l dosed him with morphine,
and the nail went straight through,


34
0:1:35,7 --> 0:1:36,487
so it's not that big a d...


35
0:1:36,487 --> 0:1:39,967
Dear God, she's getting woozy.
Quickly, show her the bloody side.


36
0:1:39,967 --> 0:1:41,727
- Look. Touch the nail.
- Yeah!


37
0:1:41,727 --> 0:1:45,487
Wanna touch it? Touch the nail.
Touch my nail! Touch it!


38
0:1:45,487 --> 0:1:48,287
- Lick the tip of my...
- Good night!


39
0:1:48,287 --> 0:1:51,967
- Let's get you to a hand surgeon.
- What about tough guy?


40
0:1:51,967 --> 0:1:55,287
Somebody'll get her.


41
0:1:55,287 --> 0:2:11,47
- Bye-bye.
- Please don't.


42
0:2:11,47 --> 0:2:14,447
l can't get over it. Who faints?
No one's fainted since the '40s.


43
0:2:14,447 --> 0:2:17,447
You're a doctor. You shouldn't
have to look at that stuff.


44
0:2:17,447 --> 0:2:19,807
l was surprised.
l don't like surprises.


45
0:2:19,807 --> 0:2:22,407
Oh, my goodness!


46
0:2:22,407 --> 0:2:26,727
Pictures capture moments in time.


47
0:2:26,727 --> 0:2:31,7
When they're posed, they're not real.
l hate that whole, like... thing.


48
0:2:31,7 --> 0:2:34,527
That's why at a party, you see
me in the bushes with my camera.


49
0:2:34,527 --> 0:2:37,167
- You're a little weird, aren't you?
- A little bit.


50
0:2:37,167 --> 0:2:40,927
Ben, look what the cat tried to drag in
before it was skinned and eaten.


51
0:2:40,927 --> 0:2:42,87
Meow.


52
0:2:42,87 --> 0:2:44,567
Still with the annoying camera?


53
0:2:44,567 --> 0:2:48,127
She just skip the part where
people say hello to each other?


54
0:2:48,127 --> 0:2:51,167
Hello, Benji.
You look very pale.


55
0:2:51,167 --> 0:2:53,447
l miss the sweet talk.


56
0:2:53,447 --> 0:2:56,727
Maybe it's been too long.
Maybe my feelings were hurt a little.


57
0:2:56,727 --> 0:2:58,727
''Feelings.'' That's a good one.


58
0:2:58,727 --> 0:3:0,887
You're a big girl.
When you got divorced,


59
0:3:0,887 --> 0:3:4,807
you put people in the awkward position
of choosing between you and Perry.


60
0:3:4,807 --> 0:3:6,607
You're my brother!


61
0:3:6,607 --> 0:3:10,767
Well, admittedly, that made
it harder. Ooh, good one!


62
0:3:10,767 --> 0:3:14,247
''Me so cranky!''


63
0:3:14,247 --> 0:3:18,567
Patient's name is Mo Weinberg. Cancer
is confined to the right testicle.


64
0:3:18,567 --> 0:3:21,247
Dr Turk will be
assisting with the removal.


65
0:3:21,247 --> 0:3:25,727
Sorry, Mo. Looks like you're
about to lose Larry or Curly.


66
0:3:25,727 --> 0:3:27,967
Starting the incision.


67
0:3:27,967 --> 0:3:31,367
Wait, wait. Stop, stop.
l'm guessing Mr Weinberg is Jewish.


68
0:3:31,367 --> 0:3:35,247
- Yeah, so?
- Why isn't he circumcised?


69
0:3:35,247 --> 0:3:37,127
<i>A recent medical study found</i>


70
0:3:37,127 --> 0:3:40,87
<i>that a mistake is made</i>
<i>on 20 percent of all patients,</i>


71
0:3:40,87 --> 0:3:42,247
<i>Most of these</i>
<i>are clerical and harmless</i>


72
0:3:42,247 --> 0:3:44,447
<i>but it still adds up</i>
<i>to a lot of near misses,</i>


73
0:3:44,447 --> 0:3:46,727
Dr Wen asks
if there could be a mix-up,


74
0:3:46,727 --> 0:3:50,607
because our appendicitis patient,
that dude doesn't have an appendix.


75
0:3:50,607 --> 0:3:53,967
Oh, wait right here.


76
0:3:53,967 --> 0:3:55,567
Wow.


77
0:3:55,567 --> 0:3:58,527
l know. You know,
we almost did... Whoa!


78
0:3:58,527 --> 0:4:1,727
What's goin' on here?


79
0:4:1,727 --> 0:4:9,327
No, Mom, l don't care what
my third grade teacher is up to.


80
0:4:9,327 --> 0:4:11,7
And scene. How are you?


81
0:4:11,7 --> 0:4:13,527
l haven't
seen you since your breakdown.


82
0:4:13,527 --> 0:4:17,487
Oh, which one?


83
0:4:17,487 --> 0:4:19,567
Oh. So...


84
0:4:19,567 --> 0:4:21,607
What's new?


85
0:4:21,607 --> 0:4:23,807
Last time l saw you
l was really stressed.


86
0:4:23,807 --> 0:4:25,807
The weight of the world
on my shoulders.


87
0:4:25,807 --> 0:4:27,887
- So guess what l did.
- Quit your job?


88
0:4:27,887 --> 0:4:31,647
Flushed my fish down the toilet.
No more feedings, no more bowl cleaning,


89
0:4:31,647 --> 0:4:34,207
no more being judged
for having a second glass of wine.


90
0:4:34,207 --> 0:4:36,767
Don't even get me
started on judgmental fish.


91
0:4:36,767 --> 0:4:40,207
But that sent me on this whole
shame spiral, so l decided to travel.


92
0:4:40,207 --> 0:4:43,327
l got hit on in Venice.
l climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.


93
0:4:43,327 --> 0:4:45,487
For about ten minutes.
lt's very steep.


94
0:4:45,487 --> 0:4:47,687
Then l went to Florida
to swim with Dolphins.


95
0:4:47,687 --> 0:4:49,647
- Oh.
- And l don't mean the fish.


96
0:4:49,647 --> 0:4:52,287
There was an NFL thing
going on at the hotel.


97
0:4:52,287 --> 0:4:55,527
- You.
- l almost forgot! l'm engaged!


98
0:4:55,527 --> 0:4:58,967
There used to be a ring,
but my fiancé did some soul-searching


99
0:4:58,967 --> 0:5:2,647
and we decided that it needed
to be a little more fancy.


100
0:5:2,647 --> 0:5:5,207
Oh, you have no idea
how happy this makes me.


101
0:5:5,207 --> 0:5:7,967
The only reason you're
vomiting and exhausted is...


102
0:5:7,967 --> 0:5:10,647
Well, you're pregnant.


103
0:5:10,647 --> 0:5:12,727
N... l'm what now?


104
0:5:12,727 --> 0:5:15,927
Yeah, pregnant!
Your fiancé's gonna be so happy!


105
0:5:15,927 --> 0:5:19,767
My fiancé and l decided not to
have sex until we were married.


106
0:5:19,767 --> 0:5:21,607
So he's not gonna be so happy.


107
0:5:21,607 --> 0:5:25,407
More curious, really, than happy.


108
0:5:25,407 --> 0:5:28,327
You'll want to rewrap
the gauze when it gets soiled.


109
0:5:28,327 --> 0:5:30,607
Rewrap a dirty bandage. lt's phenomenal


110
0:5:30,607 --> 0:5:32,727
how you doctors keep
all this in your head.


111
0:5:32,727 --> 0:5:34,967
We don't.
lt says it right there on the box.


112
0:5:34,967 --> 0:5:38,367
Look, right there. Hey, don't be
mean to him. You're mad at me.


113
0:5:38,367 --> 0:5:42,527
You shouldn't do contracting. You're
clumsy. That's why these things happen.


114
0:5:42,527 --> 0:5:43,607
They don't.


115
0:5:43,607 --> 0:5:46,247
How many times have you hurt
yourself with that nail gun?


116
0:5:46,247 --> 0:5:48,87
- Once. What?
- Oh, come on.


117
0:5:48,87 --> 0:5:50,647
That's a new nail gun.
lf it'd been any other,


118
0:5:50,647 --> 0:5:52,887
the estimate
would be slightly higher.


119
0:5:52,887 --> 0:5:54,927
lt's not funny.


120
0:5:54,927 --> 0:5:56,607
You're pretty when you're mad.


121
0:5:56,607 --> 0:6:0,447
<i>I guess sibling rivalry never goes away</i>
<i>no matter how old you get,</i>


122
0:6:0,447 --> 0:6:3,127
What is this? That doesn't hurt.


123
0:6:3,127 --> 0:6:8,527
- Doesn't hurt. Doesn't hurt.
- Oh, really?


124
0:6:8,527 --> 0:6:15,927
OK, that kind of smarts a little bit.


125
0:6:15,927 --> 0:6:20,567
- Jordan, l'll call later. All right?
- OK. Fine. Forget it. Forget it.


126
0:6:20,567 --> 0:6:22,127
You big jerk.


127
0:6:22,127 --> 0:6:24,767
You happen to remember
when she used to be fun?


128
0:6:24,767 --> 0:6:26,207
- No.
- Me neither.


129
0:6:26,207 --> 0:6:27,527
Me neither.


130
0:6:27,527 --> 0:6:30,567
When spoken to, newbie.
When spoken to.


131
0:6:30,567 --> 0:6:33,567
l thought we were clear on that one.


132
0:6:33,567 --> 0:6:36,367
We haven't grabbed a beer
in weeks. What's that about?


133
0:6:36,367 --> 0:6:39,847
<i>He's never asked me</i>
<i>to grab a beer but I don't care,</i>


134
0:6:39,847 --> 0:6:41,407
Would you like to come?


135
0:6:41,407 --> 0:6:42,807
Oh, God, yes.


136
0:6:42,807 --> 0:6:44,407
To buddies!


137
0:6:44,407 --> 0:6:46,607
What do you think you're doing?


138
0:6:46,607 --> 0:6:49,767
You can't drink. You're our driver.
That's why we brought you.


139
0:6:49,767 --> 0:6:51,407
That's just not right.


140
0:6:51,407 --> 0:6:57,287
Well, l'm gonna drink this
for both of us.


141
0:6:57,287 --> 0:7:0,687
Can't stop thinking
about Mr Weinberg's testicles.


142
0:7:0,687 --> 0:7:2,447
Dude.


143
0:7:2,447 --> 0:7:5,167
l mean, l almost
removed one of them, Todd.


144
0:7:5,167 --> 0:7:7,87
- Which one?
- Like it matters.


145
0:7:7,87 --> 0:7:8,367
Oh, it matters.


146
0:7:8,367 --> 0:7:10,807
- Bye, Todd.
- OK!


147
0:7:10,807 --> 0:7:13,887
Dr Turk, l heard about
your mishap earlier today,


148
0:7:13,887 --> 0:7:15,327
but here's the skinny.


149
0:7:15,327 --> 0:7:18,967
lf that patient finds out what happened
because you can't rein in your yapper,


150
0:7:18,967 --> 0:7:21,287
then heads will roll, and l promise,


151
0:7:21,287 --> 0:7:23,807
yours and Ted's
will be the first to go!


152
0:7:23,807 --> 0:7:25,447
What did l do?


153
0:7:25,447 --> 0:7:29,687
Consider my lips sewn shut, sir.
Which, in this hospital, could happen.


154
0:7:29,687 --> 0:7:31,327
Young man!


155
0:7:31,327 --> 0:7:35,527
At Sacred Heart,
we do not make mistakes.


156
0:7:35,527 --> 0:7:39,247
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!


157
0:7:39,247 --> 0:7:41,487
l wouldn't have slept
with someone else


158
0:7:41,487 --> 0:7:43,487
if l didn't love you so much.


159
0:7:43,487 --> 0:7:46,887
No, no, no, no, no!
Stop! Hang up the phone!


160
0:7:46,887 --> 0:7:50,767
Hold on one second.
Hold on! Hi!


161
0:7:50,767 --> 0:7:53,607
Your last name is Tracy!
Of course you know that,


162
0:7:53,607 --> 0:7:56,407
but there's a woman in 308
whose first name is Tracy.


163
0:7:56,407 --> 0:8:0,487
l started thinking about your urine
and how you stay well-hydrated,


164
0:8:0,487 --> 0:8:3,47
which is why your pee
is lighter than most people's,


165
0:8:3,47 --> 0:8:5,567
and the sample with your name on
was bright yellow,


166
0:8:5,567 --> 0:8:8,167
and the other Tracy
is not much of a water drinker,


167
0:8:8,167 --> 0:8:10,767
which is why l think
her skin looks so pasty.


168
0:8:10,767 --> 0:8:12,127
Get to the point.


169
0:8:12,127 --> 0:8:17,127
You're not pregnant!
The lab tech just switched the samples.


170
0:8:17,127 --> 0:8:19,247
You're killin' me.


171
0:8:19,247 --> 0:8:23,767
Hey, sweetie, you know l was joking
about all that stuff, right?


172
0:8:23,767 --> 0:8:25,287
Kim Basinger.


173
0:8:25,287 --> 0:8:27,527
Please. <i>Nine 1/2 Weeks,</i>


174
0:8:27,527 --> 0:8:29,287
Winona Ryder.


175
0:8:29,287 --> 0:8:31,647
Never naked,
but just a hint of nipple


176
0:8:31,647 --> 0:8:33,607
in <i>How to Make an American Quilt,</i>


177
0:8:33,607 --> 0:8:35,927
Good. At last, a worthy foe.


178
0:8:35,927 --> 0:8:37,967
Oh, chalk boy?


179
0:8:37,967 --> 0:8:40,207
''Chalk boy.''


180
0:8:40,207 --> 0:8:46,127
lf you could chalk it without
pleasuring it, that'd be terrific.


181
0:8:46,127 --> 0:8:47,447
What?


182
0:8:47,447 --> 0:8:49,767
You're going
for that gruff doctor routine,


183
0:8:49,767 --> 0:8:52,847
but you just come off
sounding like a cartoon pirate.


184
0:8:52,847 --> 0:8:56,887
''Gladys. Chalk it!
Don't pleasure it!''


185
0:8:56,887 --> 0:8:59,167
''Here's what we're gonna do.''


186
0:8:59,167 --> 0:9:0,647
Are ya done?


187
0:9:0,647 --> 0:9:2,607
Yeah, l'm done.


188
0:9:2,607 --> 0:9:4,607
Yeah, l think you are too.


189
0:9:4,607 --> 0:9:6,527
Come on. Let him have a little fun.


190
0:9:6,527 --> 0:9:8,87
All right, Clara.


191
0:9:8,87 --> 0:9:10,727
You can order yourself a Cosmopolitan.


192
0:9:10,727 --> 0:9:12,807
We'll just grab a cab home.


193
0:9:12,807 --> 0:9:17,127
Actually, Ben's been sneaking me beers
all night, and l'm quite drunk.


194
0:9:17,127 --> 0:9:20,967
That's just great.


195
0:9:20,967 --> 0:9:22,727
Hey, Ben, what...


196
0:9:22,727 --> 0:9:24,647
Why is this hand still bleeding?


197
0:9:24,647 --> 0:9:26,607
l don't know.


198
0:9:26,607 --> 0:9:28,927
lt's weird.
l cut myself shaving last week


199
0:9:28,927 --> 0:9:31,807
and it wouldn't stop bleeding.


200
0:9:31,807 --> 0:9:34,407
<i>One thing that</i>
<i>sucks about being a doctor</i>


201
0:9:34,407 --> 0:9:36,567
<i>is that you never miss a red flag,</i>


202
0:9:36,567 --> 0:9:38,847
Can l have you over here
for two seconds?


203
0:9:38,847 --> 0:9:40,407
What the hell are you doing?


204
0:9:40,407 --> 0:9:43,527
- Humour me. lt's probably mono.
- The kissing disease?


205
0:9:43,527 --> 0:9:45,567
- Yeah.
- Score.


206
0:9:45,567 --> 0:9:49,87
Your only job today is to get
his test results back, you understand?


207
0:9:49,87 --> 0:9:51,127
Hey, guys!


208
0:9:51,127 --> 0:9:53,567
See, now that's real.


209
0:9:53,567 --> 0:9:57,367
She wasn't pregnant after all.
Some idiot mislabelled her sample.


210
0:9:57,367 --> 0:10:1,247
l was a heartbeat away from giving
an appendix patient a crotch lobotomy.


211
0:10:1,247 --> 0:10:4,487
lf l do my best and l lose a patient.
l can live with that.


212
0:10:4,487 --> 0:10:7,487
But if a clerical error is the reason
a guy's walking around


213
0:10:7,487 --> 0:10:12,807
with ''only the lonely,'' damn,
that don't sit well with the big dog.


214
0:10:12,807 --> 0:10:14,727
l'm with you, big dog.


215
0:10:14,727 --> 0:10:17,727
<i>I was paged because Ben's</i>
<i>blood work was finally ready,</i>


216
0:10:17,727 --> 0:10:20,47
<i>Unfortunately the chart</i>
<i>wasn't in the out box,</i>


217
0:10:20,47 --> 0:10:22,807
<i>I'd knock but the haematopathologist</i>
<i>is the meanest</i>


218
0:10:22,807 --> 0:10:25,87
<i>intern-hating-est</i>
<i>monster in this hospital,</i>


219
0:10:25,87 --> 0:10:30,247
Don't be a chicken. lf you need
something, go in and get it.


220
0:10:30,247 --> 0:10:35,727
Excuse me, sir...


221
0:10:35,727 --> 0:10:38,767
l'll come back later.


222
0:10:38,767 --> 0:10:42,847
<i>The haematopathologist was the last</i>
<i>person I wanted to deal with,</i>


223
0:10:42,847 --> 0:10:45,967
<i>Why do you have to jump</i>
<i>out and scare me all the time?</i>


224
0:10:45,967 --> 0:10:51,87
l don't jump out and scare you.
l follow you around all day.


225
0:10:51,87 --> 0:10:53,447
l only got an hour-and-a-half
worth of work.


226
0:10:53,447 --> 0:10:55,887
The rest of the time,
l track you, like an animal.


227
0:10:55,887 --> 0:10:57,647
You're kidding, right?


228
0:10:57,647 --> 0:11:6,127
l don't know. Am l?


229
0:11:6,127 --> 0:11:10,767
<i>What? How did that get there?</i>


230
0:11:10,767 --> 0:11:16,327
- <i>Come on good news,</i>
- Hey, Bambi.


231
0:11:16,327 --> 0:11:18,527
Are you OK?


232
0:11:18,527 --> 0:11:21,407
<i>Leukaemia,</i>


233
0:11:21,407 --> 0:11:28,407
No.


234
0:11:28,407 --> 0:11:30,647
<i>When you deliver</i>
<i>horrible news to someone</i>


235
0:11:30,647 --> 0:11:33,607
<i>the walk to their door</i>
<i>can seem an eternity,</i>


236
0:11:33,607 --> 0:11:35,647
Thank you, nice nurse.


237
0:11:35,647 --> 0:11:39,447
- Ben, why?
- Cos it's my thing.


238
0:11:39,447 --> 0:11:41,847
You're just jealous
cos you don't have a thing.


239
0:11:41,847 --> 0:11:45,367
l had a thing.
l used to like to hike.


240
0:11:45,367 --> 0:11:48,287
But Jordan somehow
got that in the divorce too.


241
0:11:48,287 --> 0:11:52,287
She got your hobby?
That's vindictive.


242
0:11:52,287 --> 0:11:56,647
Look, Ben, l know l am prone to
making the occasional casual reference


243
0:11:56,647 --> 0:12:2,7
to your sister being a...
Well, a wire-haired man-goblin.


244
0:12:2,7 --> 0:12:5,647
But l hope that has no effect
on your relationship.


245
0:12:5,647 --> 0:12:8,887
lt's very sweet of you
to think that you're that important.


246
0:12:8,887 --> 0:12:10,647
- Draw on three.
- Oh, yeah.


247
0:12:10,647 --> 0:12:15,167
One, two, three, draw.


248
0:12:15,167 --> 0:12:17,207
You are in serious trouble.


249
0:12:17,207 --> 0:12:18,687
What? What?


250
0:12:18,687 --> 0:12:20,487
Hey, new friend.


251
0:12:20,487 --> 0:12:23,847
Oh, Janice, are those the test results
we've been waiting for?


252
0:12:23,847 --> 0:12:26,887
<i>Wait a sec</i>
<i>first Turk's patient then Elliot's,</i>


253
0:12:26,887 --> 0:12:30,207
<i>This is a mistake, I just</i>
<i>I feel it in my gut, I'm sure of it,</i>


254
0:12:30,207 --> 0:12:31,967
Hello, Janice?


255
0:12:31,967 --> 0:12:36,727
No, this is some...
You know, that lab is backed up again,


256
0:12:36,727 --> 0:12:38,847
and so l'm gonna...
lt's a little while.


257
0:12:38,847 --> 0:12:41,727
- All right. Terrific to see you. Bye.
- Go.


258
0:12:41,727 --> 0:12:43,487
l know who screwed this up.


259
0:12:43,487 --> 0:12:46,327
lt's that same lazy-ass nurse
that mixed up my files.


260
0:12:46,327 --> 0:12:49,647
- There she is. l'm gonna go get her.
- l can fight my own battles.


261
0:12:49,647 --> 0:12:52,647
You're gonna write an angry note?
She doesn't deserve it.


262
0:12:52,647 --> 0:12:56,327
- l lost my thesaurus.
- You go get her then.


263
0:12:56,327 --> 0:12:58,407
Hello... Nancy.


264
0:12:58,407 --> 0:13:2,7
Hi, how... Could you check,
there's a very important file l...


265
0:13:2,7 --> 0:13:4,727
You know what?
This actually means, ''in a minute.''


266
0:13:4,727 --> 0:13:7,487
Tag me in.
l am oiled-up and ready to go.


267
0:13:7,487 --> 0:13:10,287
She said a minute,
so l'm sure that in a minute...


268
0:13:10,287 --> 0:13:11,647
Now it's two. You're in.


269
0:13:11,647 --> 0:13:15,967
Thank you. My friend needs
you to check on the Ben Sullivan file,


270
0:13:15,967 --> 0:13:18,7
and you're gonna do it
right now. Why?


271
0:13:18,7 --> 0:13:21,927
Because you are not gonna drop
the ball like you did on my patient.


272
0:13:21,927 --> 0:13:25,927
- You said, ''Drop the ball.''
- l know, totally by accident.


273
0:13:25,927 --> 0:13:29,807
- Chop-chop, Nancy.
- <i>Rápido,</i>


274
0:13:29,807 --> 0:13:32,327
Hey there, buddy!


275
0:13:32,327 --> 0:13:37,247
- How is my best friend doing?
- You and l hardly know each other.


276
0:13:37,247 --> 0:13:40,207
These aren't my words.


277
0:13:40,207 --> 0:13:44,367
Hello, Dr Dorian.
Let's take a ride.


278
0:13:44,367 --> 0:13:48,447
So, word has it you've been doing
a little fishing in these here parts,


279
0:13:48,447 --> 0:13:51,247
trying to catch yourself
a prize-winning mistake.


280
0:13:51,247 --> 0:13:52,527
No, sir, l just...


281
0:13:52,527 --> 0:13:55,247
l was sure your little buddy in Surgery


282
0:13:55,247 --> 0:13:59,487
would've shared with you my most
important rule here at Sacred Heart.


283
0:13:59,487 --> 0:14:1,967
Tell him my most important rule, Ted.


284
0:14:1,967 --> 0:14:5,967
Too much ''ha-ha,''
pretty soon ''boo-hoo.''


285
0:14:5,967 --> 0:14:7,607
My other rule.


286
0:14:7,607 --> 0:14:12,207
lf you don't look for a mistake,
you can't find one.


287
0:14:12,207 --> 0:14:14,967
That's right, Teddy bear.


288
0:14:14,967 --> 0:14:18,127
Now, stop looking for trouble


289
0:14:18,127 --> 0:14:22,807
just because you like this patient,
and face the facts.


290
0:14:22,807 --> 0:14:27,847
Remove him, Ted.


291
0:14:27,847 --> 0:14:30,767
That ''ha-ha'' rule is true.


292
0:14:30,767 --> 0:14:34,647
l'm just asking you to check
and see if you could've made a mistake.


293
0:14:34,647 --> 0:14:37,247
ln seven years,
l've never made a mistake.


294
0:14:37,247 --> 0:14:40,7
You mixed up my patients'
urine samples yesterday!


295
0:14:40,7 --> 0:14:43,87
l make lots of mistakes. But l
have to go to the bathroom now.


296
0:14:43,87 --> 0:14:47,607
- After that, l'm going to lunch.
- Franklyn...


297
0:14:47,607 --> 0:14:51,47
- Can you help me out here?
- What do you want me to do, cry?


298
0:14:51,47 --> 0:14:52,687
- Can you do that?
- Sure.


299
0:14:52,687 --> 0:14:56,407
Give me a second
to think of something sad.


300
0:14:56,407 --> 0:14:58,727
- Quickly.
- OK, that's not helping.


301
0:14:58,727 --> 0:15:1,47
l shouldn't have
put you in this position.


302
0:15:1,47 --> 0:15:4,367
Oh, there we go. Another
man in my life, trying to protect me.


303
0:15:4,367 --> 0:15:5,967
Stay with it, Elliot.


304
0:15:5,967 --> 0:15:8,287
Everyone thinks l can't take criticism


305
0:15:8,287 --> 0:15:10,207
because mom and dad
give nothing but.


306
0:15:10,207 --> 0:15:12,767
- Good, this is good.
- Look where it's gotten me.


307
0:15:12,767 --> 0:15:16,407
You know, l'm 26,
single and all l do is work.


308
0:15:16,407 --> 0:15:20,607
You know, l may as well just give up
the idea of being in a healthy and...


309
0:15:20,607 --> 0:15:23,807
...happy relationship
and just go ahead and...


310
0:15:23,807 --> 0:15:26,647
And... And...


311
0:15:26,647 --> 0:15:28,407
Become your mother?


312
0:15:28,407 --> 0:15:32,927
Yeah.


313
0:15:32,927 --> 0:15:35,47
Check Mr Sullivan's tests again.


314
0:15:35,47 --> 0:15:40,767
OK.


315
0:15:40,767 --> 0:15:42,567
How cool was that?


316
0:15:42,567 --> 0:15:44,607
Why so sad, Bambi?


317
0:15:44,607 --> 0:15:46,567
Because so far
no one's screwed up.


318
0:15:46,567 --> 0:15:50,7
The clerk didn't make a mistake,
or the lab technician.


319
0:15:50,7 --> 0:15:52,687
Maybe l'm just an idiot.
l don't know.


320
0:15:52,687 --> 0:15:56,87
Let me ask you something.


321
0:15:56,87 --> 0:15:58,127
You're kind of a boob guy, right?


322
0:15:58,127 --> 0:15:59,127
Excuse me?


323
0:15:59,127 --> 0:16:3,7
l can tell. l've seen you look at mine.
Not in a sleazy way, or anything.


324
0:16:3,7 --> 0:16:5,607
This is the most uncomfortable
conversation l've had.


325
0:16:5,607 --> 0:16:7,727
- You want to touch one?
- l stand corrected.


326
0:16:7,727 --> 0:16:9,527
You're my best friend's girlfriend.


327
0:16:9,527 --> 0:16:14,927
So your instinct is to pass
on this fantastic one-time offer?


328
0:16:14,927 --> 0:16:16,927
- l'm afraid so.
- l'm up here, Bambi.


329
0:16:16,927 --> 0:16:18,287
Oh, sorry.


330
0:16:18,287 --> 0:16:20,247
With Ben, it's one of two things.


331
0:16:20,247 --> 0:16:22,447
Either your instincts
are right or your brain


332
0:16:22,447 --> 0:16:24,807
is trying to protect you
from something.


333
0:16:24,807 --> 0:16:27,887
You have pretty good instincts.
Trust them.


334
0:16:27,887 --> 0:16:30,87
What am l supposed to do though?


335
0:16:30,87 --> 0:16:32,887
You know there's only
one more person to talk to.


336
0:16:32,887 --> 0:16:36,647
<i>The haematopathologist,</i>


337
0:16:36,647 --> 0:16:38,567
Hello?


338
0:16:38,567 --> 0:16:40,927
- Call me Dr Bobb.
- You go by your first name?


339
0:16:40,927 --> 0:16:43,127
- Nope. First name's Fred.
- Fred Bobb?


340
0:16:43,127 --> 0:16:44,287
What can l do you for?


341
0:16:44,287 --> 0:16:47,767
Hi, l was hoping that you could
recheck Ben Sullivan's blood smear.


342
0:16:47,767 --> 0:16:49,647
Well that depends, young man.


343
0:16:49,647 --> 0:16:52,647
Do you think l made a mistake
or do you just wish l did?


344
0:16:52,647 --> 0:16:59,367
- l kind of wish you did.
- Then l'll do it.


345
0:16:59,367 --> 0:17:3,407
Sorry there,
giant '70s security guard guy.


346
0:17:3,407 --> 0:17:5,7
- Cold out here, huh?
- Yes.


347
0:17:5,7 --> 0:17:8,687
Yeah. You could hang
a friggin' raincoat off my nipples.


348
0:17:8,687 --> 0:17:11,847
Left one at least.
The right one's just a little shy.


349
0:17:11,847 --> 0:17:15,367
- Sticking with the weird thing?
- lt works for me.


350
0:17:15,367 --> 0:17:18,407
Listen, you guys
wouldn't be keeping me here


351
0:17:18,407 --> 0:17:22,527
if there wasn't something
potentially wrong with me, would you?


352
0:17:22,527 --> 0:17:25,847
No, we wouldn't.


353
0:17:25,847 --> 0:17:29,927
Hey, how come this guy is always
following you in the pictures?


354
0:17:29,927 --> 0:17:32,767
- Oh, my God.
- Him.


355
0:17:32,767 --> 0:17:37,687
Want to see the rest
of the pictures l took today?


356
0:17:37,687 --> 0:19:6,7
- Look at that one.
- These are good, man.


357
0:19:6,7 --> 0:19:10,127
Ben, good news, man.


358
0:19:10,127 --> 0:19:12,247
Let's get a picture together.


359
0:19:12,247 --> 0:19:15,407
- OK.
- Come on.


360
0:19:15,407 --> 0:19:18,47
<i>It was weird how everyone</i>
<i>came to see Ben off,</i>


361
0:19:18,47 --> 0:19:19,207
Everybody in.


362
0:19:19,207 --> 0:19:25,327
<i>He'd only been here one day and there</i>
<i>wasn't even anything wrong with him,</i>


363
0:19:25,327 --> 0:19:28,967
Why take a picture like that?
You said posed pictures aren't real.


364
0:19:28,967 --> 0:19:33,327
Come on, JD.
None of this is real. You know that.


365
0:19:33,327 --> 0:19:39,127
- What do you mean?
- Think about it.


366
0:19:39,127 --> 0:19:42,327
Stop looking for trouble
just because you like this patient,


367
0:19:42,327 --> 0:19:44,367
and face the facts.


368
0:19:44,367 --> 0:19:48,967
Either your instincts are right
or your brain is trying to protect you.


369
0:19:48,967 --> 0:19:52,367
Do you actually think l made
a mistake or do you just wish l did?


370
0:19:52,367 --> 0:20:6,727
l kind of wish you did.


371
0:20:6,727 --> 0:20:8,487
Janice!


372
0:20:8,487 --> 0:20:9,647
Over here, big guy.


373
0:20:9,647 --> 0:20:15,927
Let's try this again.
Are those the test results?


374
0:20:15,927 --> 0:20:21,487
Yeah.


375
0:20:21,487 --> 0:20:30,727
Ben, you have leukaemia.


376
0:20:30,727 --> 0:20:35,607
That sucks.


377
0:20:35,607 --> 0:21:28,622
Yeah.


378
0:21:28,622 --> 0:21:31,982
<i>Oh my God I can't</i>
<i>believe I'm about to do this,</i>


379
0:21:31,982 --> 0:21:34,222
What's wrong?


380
0:21:34,222 --> 0:21:36,822
- l lost my mop.
- Really?


381
0:21:36,822 --> 0:21:40,542
No. But that's the only thing
that could make me unhappy, right?


382
0:21:40,542 --> 0:21:43,382
You people think of me
as nothing but The Janitor.


383
0:21:43,382 --> 0:21:48,22
- That's not true.
- What's my name?


384
0:21:48,22 --> 0:21:51,342
l know that the nurses
call you Sir Plunge-a-lot.


385
0:21:51,342 --> 0:21:53,422
- l know.
- Come on.


386
0:21:53,422 --> 0:21:57,422
- l'm sure you don't know my name so...
- John Michael Dorian.


387
0:21:57,422 --> 0:22:1,582
- How did you know my middle name?
- Because l care.


388
0:22:1,582 --> 0:22:5,342
<i>Today seems like a good day to</i>
<i>hide out in one of my patient's rooms,</i>


389
0:22:5,342 --> 0:22:7,662
You, my friend,
are an incompetent fool!


390
0:22:7,662 --> 0:22:10,62
<i>Unless of course</i>
<i>my patient is missing,</i>


391
0:22:10,62 --> 0:22:11,822
Where's my brother?


392
0:22:11,822 --> 0:24:11,822
Say, ''l don't know,'' l'll show you what
l learned in my crotch-punching class.
