###17 I am always interested in other people, and in how
###22 people think about other people.
###24 So what I try to do in photography is to play with
###27 these prejudices.
###28 I don't want to say to people, you are wrong or your idea
###32 about other people is wrong.
###34 I also don't want to say, you're right.
###35 But I just want people to think about it.
###38 
###46 My name is Rob Hornstra.
###48 I'm a photographer, but I consider myself as a
###51 storyteller, a documentary maker, slow journalism.
###54 It's not so much about photography, but I use this
###57 medium to tell stories.
###61 I graduated in 2004, from the Art Academy, and I'm working
###65 now, for seven years, independent, on mostly long
###69 term projects.
###70 I'm from Holland, so here we are in Utrecht.
###73 And from here, I'm going out to other countries sometimes,
###78 Russia, Iceland, I hope some more in the
###82 future, but not too many.
###85 I just don't feel that I'm the type of person who will travel
###88 anywhere for one month just to see a country, to meet the
###92 people over there, and get a few shots or something.
###96 I want to go deeper and it has its disadvantages because now
###102 many people call me the Russia photographer.
###106 I'm convinced that I'm not a Russia photographer.
###109 But I'm just focusing for, maybe 10 or
###111 15 years, on Russia.
###112 So at the end of my life, people will see that I also
###116 did other things.
###117 At least, I hope that I have time left for that.
###121 This is, maybe, nice to see because it's
###122 like the older series.
###124 This is my graduation project.
###126 I graduated in 2004 with a book,
###130 "Communism and Cowgirls".
###132 For one month, I went to Russia and I focuses,
###136 particularly , on the younger m the first generation who
###140 grew up after the fall of Communism.
###143 The West became extremely popular, like, Coca-Cola and
###147 Ramstein was extremely popular.
###149 I didn't only photograph them, but I also made photos of the
###154 places they're living in.
###156 But also, for example, of their grandparents.
###159 This contrast was especially fascinating to me.
###163 When I finished the art academy, I was quite sure
###167 that, with the work I made in Russia, I
###169 wanted to make a book.
###171 And of course, I couldn't find a publisher.
###173 And then I started to investigate how much it would
###176 cost to print this book, an offset print, a real book.
###179 And it was seven and a half thousand euro for 250 copies.
###184 And I was completely shocked.
###186 But on the other hand, I was working as a bartender, and I
###189 explained this to my colleagues.
###192 And then this colleague immediately said, I want to
###196 buy a copy in advance, so here you have 30 euro and maybe you
###201 could sell some more copies in advance.
###202 And maybe it's possible.
###204 And it worked.
###206 The book sold out within three, four months.
###209 So that's good.
###210 Got the money back and I printed my first book.
###213 And as a result of this, at a certain point, I was asked for
###218 a commission in Iceland.
###220 And I did a project over there, also interested,
###223 especially, by the young generation doing nothing in
###226 these villages.
###227 Then this Iceland book, I started a new pre-sale, and it
###232 sold out within three days, instead of three
###235 weeks or four weeks.
###237 So I did it again in 2008.
###239 My third book "101 Billionaires" and what
###244 happened was that it sold out within a
###246 few hours, this pre-sale.
###248 At that moment, Russia had 101 billionaires, and what I
###252 showed actually was the 99% of the rest of the country.
###256 
###261 Well, every morning I have to do shift some books, the
###267 orders which come in.
###269 And it's not that difficult.
###274 That's it, actually.
###275 This is for today, so we'll bring it to the post office.
###278 
###283 The difficulty is, of course, when you are self-published,
###286 is that you have to organize everything by yourself.
###289 So you start with finding a designer.
###291 You have to work with writers, with a translator.
###294 You have to find a budget, you have to find money, organize
###297 the payments, of course.
###299 And when you finish it, the book is finally there.
###303 Then you also have to ship all the books.
###305 So it's a lot of work.
###308 On the other hand, I believe that if you publish the books
###312 yourself, you are completely free in whatever you want to
###315 do with the book.
###316 The only thing I care about is that I want to tell my story.
###320 I'll have to sell this book, but it's really secondary.
###323 I want to make this book and I believe that, if I tell the
###325 story in a perfect way, that people will be interested.
###327 That's actually my only idea behind it.
###329 
###335 In 2008, right at the moment that I published "101
###339 Billionaires", I was approached by a writer, Arnold
###341 van Bruggen.
###343 I was already working with him, also for "101
###345 Billionaires".
###346 And he told me about Olympic Winter Games in Sochi.
###351 It was announced in 2007.
###353 And Arnold tried to convince me to do a long term project
###357 about the region around Sochi.
###360 The goal of this project is to document it for five years and
###365 to make an atlas of the region in words and images.
###369 Sochi is over here, quite far to the west and to
###373 the south, of course.
###375 And actually, what you see over here is the whole Soviet
###377 Union, but partly, the lighter brown is Russia.
###383 And Sochi is near the Black Sea, so it's a holiday resort.
###389 And from Sochi, you go straight up into the
###392 mountains, the Caucasus Mountains, into the more or
###396 less troubled republics, Chechnya, Dagestan,
###399 Ingushetia.
###400 It borders Georgia, borders Abkhazia, also a conflict zone
###405 where a lot of things go on right now.
###406 
###412 So I just arrived last night in Sochi, from Utrecht,
###417 Amsterdam, Moscow, Sochi.
###419 We're now on the 15th floor of the Hotel Zhemchuzhina, which
###424 means the pearl.
###425 It's a hotel built in the end the '90s, end
###428 of the Soviet times.
###429 And I think, actually, that the view you have over here
###431 from Zhemchuzhina, is one of the most
###434 brilliant views in Sochi.
###437 I took already many photos.
###439 What we, for example, want to do is to show what kind of
###443 place Sochi is.
###444 And Sochi is really a tourist resort, but maybe things are
###449 little bit different than you expect.
###451 And this is also kind of an aim or goal for me, within
###455 photography, to tell stories which make people think and
###459 maybe they start to reconsider their prejudice.
###463 What we tried to do is to document this region to give a
###468 good view also because you can be sure that, around these
###471 Olympic Games, there will be a big facade from Russia to show
###475 how great and fantastic everything is.
###480 We are, right now, at the area where they
###482 built the Olympic stadiums.
###484 What we see over here is really a journalistic picture,
###487 I think, because it's the new stadiums and the old houses,
###492 all in one shot.
###495 I don't like this kind of picture, by the way.
###497 
###500 That's really what the journalists like.
###502 It explains, actually, the situation.
###504 But I do not really like it for my work.
###506 It tells you too much.
###508 It's like exactly what it is.
###510 It doesn't leave anything to your imagination.
###512 
###515 Slow of journalism is a little bit strange description of
###519 what we are doing.
###520 Actually, this term was invented, I think, by someone
###523 in the Netherlands.
###524 And I believe slow journalism is similar to documentary.
###528 And I believe, actually, that the big difference is that
###532 journalism is focusing on what is happening, and slow
###537 journalism is more why these things are happening.
###540 
###573 Now what's this?
###574 This food is really amazing.
###576 
###579 What you see over here is what will be the main stadium.
###581 
###593 On the first of April, this year, 2011, we started the
###597 third year of the Sochi project.
###599 So at a certain point, I came up with the idea--
###603 We were sitting in a restaurant and there was a
###606 singer starting his show again, which in the
###610 restaurant, in Sochi, always means that you cannot talk
###612 with each other any more.
###614 
###617 And this is actually a really typical Russian cultural
###621 thing, but even more typical for Sochi.
###624 So what I will do, in the upcoming days in Sochi, is
###629 investigate if it can be a good subject for a new
###633 publication.
###634 
###637 Last night we went to a cafe restaurant, [INAUDIBLE] which
###640 means South.
###642 And it looked like a very interesting place, beautiful
###645 background, some interesting details like a [INAUDIBLE]
###650 standing on the right, and there was a nice toilet sign
###655 near the stage.
###656 So there must be a good picture in it.
###659 I was happy with it.
###662 So when we started this project we
###664 decided we need money.
###666 And we cannot rely on magazines and newspapers, just
###670 the story everybody's telling.
###673 So we wanted to do something different.
###675 And we looked to the U.S., and what we saw over there was
###678 kickstarter.com and spot.us, both crowd funding sites.
###684 And they were very interesting to us because we didn't notice
###688 in the Netherlands and we were almost sure that we didn't see
###691 it in Europe yet.
###692 So we tried to copy this model from the U.S. Many people were
###698 interested in it and started donating, not enough to do
###702 what we want to do, but it's a really big amount of money.
###706 And we hope we can make it for five years.
###709 
###715 In 2009, we started by making our first trip and we came to
###720 the idea to make a publication about sanatoriums in Sochi.
###725 Sanatoriums are extremely important and
###728 Russians like it a lot.
###729 We decided to stay there for almost two weeks and to do
###734 exactly what Russians also do.
###736 You have to go in the mineral bath, massage, and you get
###739 like an electric loaded clay treatment and those kind of
###742 things, very interesting to see for us.
###746 And then we heard that, because of the Olympic games,
###749 they want to change them into four or five star hotels.
###753 And that's the reason why we decided to make the first
###755 publication about sanatoriums because that's the only way we
###759 can preserve this history.
###761 There are only a few boxes left with the last really big
###770 book, Empty Land or [INAUDIBLE].
###774 We were already working, at that time, for four years in
###778 the neighboring country of Abkhazia which is really
###782 neighboring the Olympic stadiums within five
###785 kilometers, so it's walking distance.
###787 So the second year, we made a book completely about
###790 Abkhazia, and it's a very complicated story over there.
###794 Actually, this country is isolated because it's not
###796 recognized by any country in the world until 2008.
###800 Russia decided to recognize Abkhazia as
###803 an independent country.
###805 it's an extremely complicated story, so in the end, it also
###808 became an extremely book.
###810 It's a big historical, political
###812 document about this region.
###814 
###822 We are in a hurry tonight, because I actually want to do
###825 five restaurants.
###826 That's quite a lot, but they are very close.
###829 We're now in the center of Sochi and hope to do five.
###833 So we have to hurry.
###835 What we realized immediately is that we cannot make such a
###839 big document as we did in Abkhazia, within a few months.
###844 We worked on this for four years.
###847 So our idea came to do a more simple subject.
###852 We cannot do such a big book, but we can do these Sochi
###855 singers, the lounge singers.
###859 That will be, probably, our new publication in 2011.
###866 I'm making a series about musicians in restaurants.
###868 And the most beautiful is, if I have a big interior, well, I
###872 will have it over here, and if you sing like you do, what you
###875 also normally do, so don't pay too much attention to me.
###879 Sometimes look at the camera, and then, finally, it will be
###882 a brilliant picture.
###883 
###889 And in 2013, we will probably make our end book a really big
###895 book and what he call the atlas about
###897 the region of Sochi.
###899 This will be combined with a really big exhibition in, we
###904 hope, many places in Europe, around the Olympic Games.
###907 
###917 Well, I think I will be here earlier before the Olympics.
###920 
###923 But actually what we do, we also try to present projects
###928 in different ways.
###930 We don't have to think about these newspapers and
###933 magazines any more.
###934 We don't have to think about all traditional ways to tell a
###937 story, especially, because I'm self published.
###940 And there are many self publishers.
###942 You don't have to think in a way that documentary makers
###946 did it 20 years ago.
###948 We can do, actually, anything, because nobody tells us,
###951 nobody tells us what to do, actually,
###953 so we can do anything.
###955 And that's really good about these times.
###956
