1
0:0:0,14 --> 0:0:4,26
army colonel denise linda has ruled the
bradley manning


2
0:0:4,26 --> 0:0:7,31
was illegally punished in quantico


3
0:0:7,31 --> 0:0:11,639
uh... summary break that he stayed in
for nine months and their as they went


4
0:0:11,639 --> 0:0:12,799
through a number of


5
0:0:12,799 --> 0:0:16,28
degrading treatment for and kept them in
the isolation


6
0:0:16,28 --> 0:0:19,19
and she said that uh... they were wrong
in


7
0:0:19,19 --> 0:0:23,949
but cutting office customer one are our
exercise thereof for that month


8
0:0:23,949 --> 0:0:25,189
period there were


9
0:0:25,189 --> 0:0:28,999
wrong in the uh... how they dealt with
this so-called sunshine call where you


10
0:0:28,999 --> 0:0:31,19
would actually be go out for twenty
minutes


11
0:0:31,19 --> 0:0:33,31
they were on the stripping him down
naked


12
0:0:33,31 --> 0:0:36,79
uh... et cetera in fact she says quote


13
0:0:36,79 --> 0:0:40,1
at some point continuing p_o_i_
prevention of injury watch


14
0:0:40,1 --> 0:0:41,249
over the recommend


15
0:0:41,249 --> 0:0:45,61
insures overruled over mental health
professionals becomes excessive


16
0:0:45,61 --> 0:0:48,5
absent a change in circumstances


17
0:0:48,5 --> 0:0:51,12
so yes we were right all along


18
0:0:51,12 --> 0:0:53,34
bradley manning worst-kept


19
0:0:53,34 --> 0:0:55,399
and in circumstances


20
0:0:55,399 --> 0:0:58,57
that would lead to his illegal
punishment


21
0:0:58,57 --> 0:1:0,48
now what as a consequence of this


22
0:1:0,48 --> 0:1:3,21
now i've said


23
0:1:3,21 --> 0:1:6,76
you know even if he is convicted of the
charges of fraud of the that he should


24
0:1:6,76 --> 0:1:10,87
be released now for time served you've
served a lot of time


25
0:1:10,87 --> 0:1:14,71
he has been a malcolm warning to and
military george


26
0:1:14,71 --> 0:1:16,86
already been illegally punished


27
0:1:16,86 --> 0:1:18,65
enough is enough


28
0:1:18,65 --> 0:1:20,67
that daniel ellsberg never went to jail


29
0:1:20,67 --> 0:1:22,99
for the pentagon papers and


30
0:1:22,99 --> 0:1:26,2
that obama administration the bush
administration report


31
0:1:26,2 --> 0:1:26,65
leaked


32
0:1:26,65 --> 0:1:28,28
classified information


33
0:1:28,28 --> 0:1:30,749
all the time nobody ever went to jail
for it


34
0:1:30,749 --> 0:1:32,87
that was suppose pro-government


35
0:1:32,87 --> 0:1:35,879
now if you need information that is not
pro government all the sun


36
0:1:35,879 --> 0:1:39,63
you get legally punish the victorian to
a military judge


37
0:1:39,63 --> 0:1:41,33
instead though she has said


38
0:1:41,33 --> 0:1:42,98
that she will


39
0:1:42,98 --> 0:1:44,47
take some credit


40
0:1:44,47 --> 0:1:49,32
and give it an applied to whatever has
had this might eventually be


41
0:1:49,32 --> 0:1:51,11
all that is good news


42
0:1:51,11 --> 0:1:55,47
how much a credit is in my estimation is
not great news it's nearly four months


43
0:1:55,47 --> 0:1:57,69
of credits a hundred twelve days


44
0:1:57,69 --> 0:1:59,78
that he gets for being uh...


45
0:1:59,78 --> 0:2:1,2
for time served


46
0:2:1,2 --> 0:2:2,45
on top


47
0:2:2,45 --> 0:2:5,44
uh... because of the illegal punishment


48
0:2:5,44 --> 0:2:9,2
it they will be whatever his final said
this is they will remove


49
0:2:9,2 --> 0:2:13,49
on june twelve days from that sentence


50
0:2:13,49 --> 0:2:14,279
when we


51
0:2:14,279 --> 0:2:18,379
illegally punish people and in other
cases we tortured people in


52
0:2:18,379 --> 0:2:22,159
this case we put them in isolation and
some proposed psychological torture in


53
0:2:22,159 --> 0:2:22,94
fact it


54
0:2:22,94 --> 0:2:24,57
united nations has already


55
0:2:24,57 --> 0:2:27,109
uh... told us that we were in violation
of


56
0:2:27,109 --> 0:2:30,609
of rules that led to this kind of
psychological abuse


57
0:2:30,609 --> 0:2:33,409
uh... well i think


58
0:2:33,409 --> 0:2:37,179
consequence of that should not be just
hey we give him another four months off


59
0:2:37,179 --> 0:2:39,489
remember it's in the air facing a
possible


60
0:2:39,489 --> 0:2:40,899
life sentence


61
0:2:40,899 --> 0:2:42,129
so


62
0:2:42,129 --> 0:2:46,569
there is a life send this to inform us
all of that doesn't help you much


63
0:2:46,569 --> 0:2:47,78
time served


64
0:2:47,78 --> 0:2:49,409
under free bradley manning


65
0:2:49,409 --> 0:2:52,419
that's what the results should be but
today is a good day


66
0:2:52,419 --> 0:2:53,77
it is the military


67
0:2:53,77 --> 0:2:56,899
saying yes we were wrong and how we
punish them


68
0:2:56,899 --> 0:4:56,899
and there should be consequences
