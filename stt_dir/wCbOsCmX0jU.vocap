###18 STEPHANIE IZARD: All right, cheers to me.
###20 
###24 Holy shit, I am not drinking that whole thing.
###27 Beautiful.
###29 It's just fun in here.
###30 It is like a party all the time.
###32 For me, it's just all about flavor and it's having people
###34 take a bite and then they're like whoa.
###36 And there's just so much flavor
###37 going on in their mouths.
###39 My name is Stephanie Izard, I'm the chef and owner of Girl
###42 & The Goat.
###42 I went to University of Michigan for undergrad first.
###45 I was a sociology major.
###46 I started working at the Olive Garden, that was my first
###48 industry job.
###50 Their bread sticks are pretty damn tasty, I'm
###52 not going to lie.
###53 After college I ended up going to culinary school.
###55 My dad was like, you know, you haven't found anything you
###57 love in college as much as you love cooking, so you should go
###59 to culinary school.
###60 And I think at the time I really thought that you
###61 graduate culinary school and you're like a chef.
###64 I didn't get that you graduate culinary school and you make
###65 $7 an hour and you make salads, but I was super
###67 excited anyway.
###68 So my dad's like, you're going to make $7 an hour?
###71 I was like yeah, I'm going to make some salads.
###73 It's going to be awesome.
###74 The restaurant I was working at closed for renovations, and
###76 I came out to Chicago to visit some friends for a few days.
###78 While I was out here, it was June when it's actually
###81 beautiful here.
###81 And there were just nice people and cute boys
###83 everywhere and I was like, I'm moving to Chicago.
###86 I make decisions just sort of last minute
###88 without telling anybody.
###89 
###98 So these are my two not a lot of hair Jared friends.
###101 I've actually known this not a lot of hair Jared for longer.
###104 When did we meet, like four years ago?
###107 JARED VAN CAMP: Four or five years ago, yeah.
###108 STEPHANIE IZARD: I was dating his friend who's
###109 a chef in the city.
###110 JARED VAN CAMP: Yeah, I remember it.
###112 STEPHANIE IZARD: And this is Jared I met like, what did we
###116 decide, two months ago?
###117 JARED ROUBEN: I think so.
###118 JARED VAN CAMP: So, we got cotto salami, finocchiona,
###122 toscano salami, chorizo, sopressata, a little pastrami,
###127 pate de compagne, some toast, picalilly, and some assorted
###131 pickles and olives.
###133 STEPHANIE IZARD: Yeah, I was actually thinking about this
###134 this afternoon, because I was thinking about meeting up with
###135 you and we're going to go find Koren.
###137 All of our chefs that are-- and I was like are we the
###139 young generation?
###139 I was like, we're kind of like the medium-age generation.
###143 But it's sort of like our generation.
###144 Nothing against the slightly--
###146 JARED VAN CAMP: Older?
###147 STEPHANIE IZARD: Just ahead of our time, but people we all
###149 worked for like Shawn McClain, and Paul Kahan, and Rick
###151 Bayless and Charlie Trotter, and all the people that--
###154 JARED VAN CAMP: Yeah, for sure.
###155 STEPHANIE IZARD: And now we're just sort of the people that
###157 worked for them.
###157 And now we're all just buddy buddies, let's
###159 make Chicago awesome.
###160 JARED VAN CAMP: It's one of the coolest things about being
###162 in Chicago, is the camaraderie in the industry.
###165 STEPHANIE IZARD: We just want the city to get better.
###167 We want to open fun, cool restaurants and support local
###169 and do as many charities as we can.
###170 And all do it together because you can't do it by yourself.
###173 I think chefs all love hanging out with each other because we
###175 also learn from each other.
###177 So I guess the more stuff I can get out there and do while
###180 still keeping this place running, the better.
###182 
###188 So then I take both Jareds, both non-hair Jareds, over to
###192 Avec because it's my favorite restaurant in the city.
###195 Yeah, whenever I'm asked what's the favorite restaurant
###196 in the city, Avec, Avec, Avec.
###198 Going to Avec is going and hanging with your friends and
###201 drinking and eating and exactly what we
###203 try to capture here.
###204 
###208 Koren's just cool.
###210 We became friends a couple of years ago.
###214 I mean, maybe a little bit of it is like oh, cool, another
###216 cool chick chef that I can hang out with.
###218 But we hang out at events together, we're just sort of
###221 into supporting the same things.
###224 Brandade, brandade, and--
###225 JARED VAN CAMP: No, no, Stephanie, it's OK.
###228 No, really, I'm sorry.
###229 
###232 KOREN GRIEVESON: Grammer pizza.
###233 STEPHANIE IZARD: Queso, fresco, green figs, Serrano,
###235 and de coto.
###237 JARED VAN CAMP: I like that.
###237 STEPHANIE IZARD: So just delisio?
###238 
###241 STEPHANIE IZARD: Delisio ricotta--
###242 KOREN GRIEVESON: A little truffle oil.
###243 STEPHANIE IZARD: A little truffle oil in between
###246 flatbread that's sliced really thin, and
###248 it's freaking delicious.
###250 You're probably my only close, female friend chef.
###255 STEPHANIE IZARD: Anything.
###256 JARED ROUBEN: Boom.
###256 KOREN GRIEVESON: Let's put it out there.
###257 STEPHANIE IZARD: In this city though, I don't have any other
###259 chick chef friends.
###260 I think that most women just decide to either
###262 go one way or another.
###263 They're going to go have a family and have children, or
###266 stick with a career.
###267 Maybe that's why there's not so many.
###269 It always comes up in conversation.
###270 Why are there so few females?
###273 And I don't know, maybe more chicks should be doing this I
###276 guess would be my answer.
###277 
###286 STEPHANIE IZARD: It is.
###287 I mean, for anyone.
###288 It's suddenly taking a toll on me.
###291 Yesterday, I honestly, to leave work early, and I just
###293 slept for 12 hours straight.
###295 For some reason there are just more men in the industry.
###298 And I think part of it's also when I started
###300 working on the industry--
###301 I'm not easily offended and nothing that guys can say in
###303 the kitchen is going to bother me whatsoever.
###305 If they want to talk about picking up chicks, or I'm not
###308 going to get into the things that get
###309 talked about in kitchens.
###310 But if you're easily offended it's not going to work well
###313 for you, I'll just say that for women.
###314 I love the brandade.
###316 Salty, creamy goodness with little teeny specks of [BLEEP]
###319 crunchy.
###319 JARED ROUBEN: It is so delicious.
###321 STEPHANIE IZARD: I know.
###322 JARED VAN CAMP: Hold on.
###323 Salty, creamy goodness with little [BLEEP]
###326 specks of
###326 STEPHANIE IZARD: A teeny spice of crunchy.
###327 JARED VAN CAMP: You should put it on the menu as that.
###332 STEPHANIE IZARD: After Avec, we walked down the street with
###334 our new little posse of chefs, walking back
###337 to Girl & The Goat.
###338 We were doing this "Elle" magazine shoot a few weeks
###341 ago, and they wanted us to look like we were after work
###344 eating lamb shanks together and stuff.
###346 And I was like, why don't we do that after work?
###347 That's pretty sweet.
###349 
###352 So it's basically grilled octopus with a fish sauce
###355 vinaigrette.
###355 Fava beans, yellow wax beans, a little bit of the house wine
###358 [INAUDIBLE], and some lemon pistachio vinaigrette.
###361 It's one of my favorite things I make.
###363 
###366 ALL: Cheers!
###367 
###373 STEPHANIE IZARD: One of my bartenders one day, I got to
###376 work, he's like what's the deal?
###377 He's like, you work 18 hours a day--
###378 18, 19, 20, 21, 22--
###381 drink four and sleep two, if that adds up to 24.
###384 I'm not even sure right now.
###385 MALE SPEAKER: I'm getting paid and I'm eating food?
###388 This is awesome.
###389 FEMALE SPEAKER: Cheers to you, [INAUDIBLE].
###391 MALE SPEAKER: I'm going to get out of here before we've got
###393 to clean up, for sure.
###394 I'm hopping on the bike and I'm gone.
###396 JARED ROUBEN: Here's to being
###397 better-looking than that table.
###399 ALL: Woo!
###400 
###402 FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah!
###403 STEPHANIE IZARD: I mean, I don't think you need to go out
###405 and party until 4:00 AM with your chefs all the time--
###407 sometimes I do that.
###408 Even if I hang out with them, and party with them, and take
###410 them to events and have a good time, they still will listen
###413 when I'm like, you're not plating that right.
###416 I guess there's different ways of getting respect from people
###418 that work for you.
###419 And maybe there's some people that work here that think I am
###422 just a crazy party girl and they're like great boss lady.
###425 But I think for the most part we've just created this really
###427 fun atmosphere to work in.
###429 I've worked places where I go into other kitchens and it's
###432 absolute dead silence.
###434 And I've worked in a kitchen where I got
###435 in trouble for laughing.
###436 And, I don't know, I laugh a lot, I sing and
###439 dance with my cooks.
###440 
###445 It's all about having fun.
###447 Eating's about having fun, so cooking should be
###448 about having fun.
###450 JARED VAN CAMP: There we go!
###452 ALL: Woo hoo!
###453
