I'm still that every day.


208
0:8:43,97 --> 0:8:47,25
But more and more I thinking
of it in the third person.


209
0:8:47,25 --> 0:8:50,77
I am more careful with what
I'm posting online.


210
0:8:50,77 --> 0:8:52,24
That's kind of the beauty of the
internet, though, is you


211
0:8:52,24 --> 0:8:55,9
get to choose what you want
to broadcast to people.


212
0:8:55,9 --> 0:8:58,21
The more I'm getting into it,
especially since I've gone


213
0:8:58,21 --> 0:9:2,23
solo, the more I view it as this
third person thing, which


214
0:9:2,23 --> 0:9:3,955
keeps me sane for sure.


215
0:9:3,955 --> 0:9:8,9
Because I'm not always a crazy
internet person, I guess.


216
0:9:8,9 --> 0:9:11,18
It makes you super self
aware, I think.


217
0:9:11,18 --> 0:9:13,57
The first time you use Facebook,
you have the option


218
0:9:13,57 --> 0:9:15,4
of, what's your profile
picture?


219
0:9:15,4 --> 0:9:18,9
Even choosing your profile
picture, that's a statement of


220
0:9:18,9 --> 0:9:20,74
how you view yourself.


221
0:9:20,74 --> 0:9:24,34
It's a very self reflexive,
self aware activity.


222
0:9:24,34 --> 0:9:26,85
It's insane, now little
kids are doing that.


223
0:9:26,85 --> 0:9:30,43
I feel like everyone is becoming
self aware in the


224
0:9:30,43 --> 0:9:31,31
past few years.


225
0:9:31,31 --> 0:9:32,55
It's just going to
keep getting more


226
0:9:32,55 --> 0:9:35,1
and more hyper aware.


227
0:9:35,1 --> 0:9:37,22
I've been on vacation where
I have stepped away, but I


228
0:9:37,22 --> 0:9:38,47
really don't like it.


229
0:9:38,47 --> 0:9:42,33



230
0:9:42,33 --> 0:9:44,18
I don't think it's a
physical addiction.


231
0:9:44,18 --> 0:9:44,92
Definitely it's not.


232
0:9:44,92 --> 0:9:45,96
I don't get sick.


233
0:9:45,96 --> 0:9:47,74
And I don't have physical
withdrawals.


234
0:9:47,74 --> 0:9:50,21
I'm not throwing up if I
don't check my email.


235
0:9:50,21 --> 0:9:52,5
It's an obsession, more than
an addiction, I think.


236
0:9:52,5 --> 0:9:53,12
I'm obsessed with
the internet.


237
0:9:53,12 --> 0:9:55,34
I need to see what's going on.


238
0:9:55,34 --> 0:9:58,24
I need to be connected with
those people that I like.


239
0:9:58,24 --> 0:9:59,97
And I don't want to
miss anything.


240
0:9:59,97 --> 0:10:1,25
I'm addicted to the internet
completely.


241
0:10:1,25 --> 0:10:3,36
I'm on it way too much.


242
0:10:3,36 --> 0:10:4,65
But maybe not way too much.


243
0:10:4,65 --> 0:10:7,35
I enjoy my time on
the internet.


244
0:10:7,35 --> 0:10:8,14
I have stepped away.


245
0:10:8,14 --> 0:10:10,61
I have gone on vacation and been
away from the internet


246
0:10:10,61 --> 0:10:11,88
for five days.


247
0:10:11,88 --> 0:10:12,62
It's refreshing.


248
0:10:12,62 --> 0:10:16,21
You come back and then you
realize, I don't need all this


249
0:10:16,21 --> 0:10:16,94
bullshit, really.


250
0:10:16,94 --> 0:10:18,97
But then right away when
you get back into it,


251
0:10:18,97 --> 0:10:19,62
you're back in it.


252
0:10:19,62 --> 0:10:22,14
So I think it's healthy once
in while, to get away.


253
0:10:22,14 --> 0:10:24,8
And to know that you
can get away.


254
0:10:24,8 --> 0:10:26,21
And it's not the end of the
world if you miss a few emails


255
0:10:26,21 --> 0:10:27,43
here or there.


256
0:10:27,43 --> 0:10:30,83
If it's a day where I don't have
anything to do and I'm


257
0:10:30,83 --> 0:10:41,95
just in the studio,
probably 11 hours.


258
0:10:41,95 --> 0:10:44,55
Yeah, I spend about 11 hours
a day on the internet or in


259
0:10:44,55 --> 0:10:47,35
front of a screen.
