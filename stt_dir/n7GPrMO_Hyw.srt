1
0:0:7,687 --> 0:0:14,6
ROBERTS: They say this is where it all began.


2
0:0:14,6 --> 0:0:20,646
That we are all children of Africa.


3
0:0:20,646 --> 0:0:26,207
But if so, why do we look so different?


4
0:0:26,207 --> 0:0:29,687
And how on earth could a handful of African families


5
0:0:29,687 --> 0:0:45,127
become a whole world full of people?


6
0:0:45,127 --> 0:0:50,6
I'm Alice Roberts, medical doctor and anthropologist.


7
0:0:50,6 --> 0:0:55,246
I'm fascinated by what bones, stones


8
0:0:55,246 --> 0:1:1,447
and even our bodies can reveal about the distant past.


9
0:1:1,447 --> 0:1:5,927
I'm going in search of the traces left by our African ancestors


10
0:1:5,927 --> 0:1:10,7
and their journeys to populate the world.


11
0:1:10,7 --> 0:1:13,326
This time, the most intriguing puzzle of all...


12
0:1:13,326 --> 0:1:14,647
That's beautiful.


13
0:1:14,647 --> 0:1:16,966
...how on earth did people make the long


14
0:1:16,966 --> 0:1:22,167
and dangerous journey to Australia,


15
0:1:22,167 --> 0:1:25,167
before they even reached Europe?


16
0:1:25,167 --> 0:1:28,206
I'm really worried we're gonna get swept in by these breakers.


17
0:1:28,206 --> 0:1:31,126
Come with me in the footsteps of our ancestors


18
0:1:31,126 --> 0:1:53,126
on the most epic adventure ever undertaken.


19
0:1:53,126 --> 0:1:59,727
No one knows how humans first reached Australia.


20
0:1:59,727 --> 0:2:3,887
WOMAN ON RADIO: Forty-one degrees in Mildura today and 4 1 in Swan Hill.


21
0:2:3,887 --> 0:2:8,687
ROBERTS: So I'm starting where the journey could have ended,


22
0:2:8,687 --> 0:2:20,727
in a remote wilderness 800 kilometres from Sydney.


23
0:2:20,727 --> 0:2:25,127
This landscape is just so parched and barren-looking.


24
0:2:25,127 --> 0:2:30,86
And it's mid-morning, and it's already over 40 degrees out there.


25
0:2:30,86 --> 0:2:32,287
Baking.


26
0:2:32,287 --> 0:2:36,847
And as soon as you step outside the car, you get mobbed by hundreds of flies.


27
0:2:36,847 --> 0:2:40,646
Not very pleasant.


28
0:2:40,646 --> 0:2:42,46
It's hard to imagine


29
0:2:42,46 --> 0:2:46,727
why our ancestors would have wanted to make this their home.


30
0:2:46,727 --> 0:2:53,206
If that's really what happened.


31
0:2:53,206 --> 0:2:55,887
There's so little evidence.


32
0:2:55,887 --> 0:3:6,967
But just recently, something was found near here.


33
0:3:6,967 --> 0:3:12,7
one of the few people who knows its whereabouts is Warren Clark.


34
0:3:12,7 --> 0:3:14,287
-We'll just walk up the ridge a bit. -Up here?


35
0:3:14,287 --> 0:3:19,847
Yeah.


36
0:3:19,847 --> 0:3:38,46
ROBERTS: The discovery was made by a young Aboriginal Australian.


37
0:3:38,46 --> 0:3:40,887
ROBERTS: So major that as soon as it was revealed


38
0:3:40,887 --> 0:3:44,567
the site was buried again, to protect it.


39
0:3:44,567 --> 0:4:0,687
It's still secret today?


40
0:4:0,687 --> 0:4:3,167
ROBERTS: But I've come here on a special day.


41
0:4:3,167 --> 0:4:6,407
Because for the first time since the site was reburied,


42
0:4:6,407 --> 0:4:10,447
local Aboriginal people and archaeologists are gathering once more


43
0:4:10,447 --> 0:4:19,206
to check on their discovery.


44
0:4:19,206 --> 0:4:23,846
over 500 human footprints.


45
0:4:23,846 --> 0:4:26,367
ROBERTS: This is the heel here.


46
0:4:26,367 --> 0:4:28,807
And you can see the way that the foot sort of lifts up here,


47
0:4:28,807 --> 0:4:30,726
that's where the arch of the foot would be.


48
0:4:30,726 --> 0:4:35,127
And then the big toe is just there. So this is a right foot.


49
0:4:35,127 --> 0:4:38,567
It's amazing to see something which is so ephemeral,


50
0:4:38,567 --> 0:4:41,726
sort of normally here today, gone tomorrow.


51
0:4:41,726 --> 0:4:43,927
This is looking like a pretty big footprint.


52
0:4:43,927 --> 0:4:47,687
-Yeah, he's well fed. -(LAUGHING) Yeah.


53
0:4:47,687 --> 0:4:51,206
ROBERTS: It's incredibly hard, this layer, isn't it? Feels really stony.


54
0:4:51,206 --> 0:4:55,247
-Is it a type of clay? -MAN: It's just like our pottery.


55
0:4:55,247 --> 0:4:57,726
And it must feel pretty personal as well, 'cause, you know, this is...


56
0:4:57,726 --> 0:4:59,367
I mean, this is your own heritage, isn't it?


57
0:4:59,367 --> 0:5:1,447
One of the oldest cultures in the world.


58
0:5:1,447 --> 0:5:11,607
So it's very special and unique.


59
0:5:11,607 --> 0:5:16,166
ROBERTS: But who do the footprints belong to?


60
0:5:16,166 --> 0:5:20,526
Tanya Charles was here when they were found.


61
0:5:20,526 --> 0:5:23,206
TANYA: Other people that was with us, they were saying,


62
0:5:23,206 --> 0:5:24,966
''They belong to the farmers that were here.''


63
0:5:24,966 --> 0:5:28,127
And we're like, ''No, they're ours.''


64
0:5:28,127 --> 0:5:32,807
(LAUGHS) You fellas wear shoes. We don't. We didn't back then.


65
0:5:32,807 --> 0:5:37,766
We just knew in our hearts, we knew that they were ours.


66
0:5:37,766 --> 0:5:40,86
ROBERTS: Scientists and Aboriginal trackers


67
0:5:40,86 --> 0:5:43,326
have interpreted the prints of men, women and children


68
0:5:43,326 --> 0:5:48,166
walking and running around the edges of what was once an ancient lake.


69
0:5:48,166 --> 0:5:53,607
The most bizarre track seems to have belonged to a one-legged man.


70
0:5:53,607 --> 0:5:56,326
Like, we sort of knew that he only had one foot,


71
0:5:56,326 --> 0:5:57,687
but we didn't want to believe it.


72
0:5:57,687 --> 0:5:58,766
ROBERTS: Yeah.


73
0:5:58,766 --> 0:6:3,487
'Cause, you know, one-footed men way back in them times is like, ''Oh, scary.''


74
0:6:3,487 --> 0:6:7,166
And he was chasing a kangaroo, and on his first throw


75
0:6:7,166 --> 0:6:8,766
he actually missed the kangaroo.


76
0:6:8,766 --> 0:6:10,166
ROBERTS: (LAUGHING) Right.


77
0:6:10,166 --> 0:6:15,526
Yeah. On his second throw, he got him and dropped him down to one knee.


78
0:6:15,526 --> 0:6:23,887
ROBERTS: How long ago did these people live?


79
0:6:23,887 --> 0:6:27,367
With a new technique called luminescence dating,


80
0:6:27,367 --> 0:6:30,286
scientists could measure the tiniest glow


81
0:6:30,286 --> 0:6:33,406
when grains of sand from the footprints were analysed.


82
0:6:33,406 --> 0:6:39,726
And from this, they could calculate how long the footprints had lain buried.


83
0:6:39,726 --> 0:6:43,247
The results were stunning.


84
0:6:43,247 --> 0:6:55,47
The footprints were around 20,000 years old.


85
0:6:55,47 --> 0:6:56,567
There's something really intimate about this,


86
0:6:56,567 --> 0:7:1,47
because it's just a moment in somebody's life,


87
0:7:1,47 --> 0:7:3,607
when they walked across this landscape.


88
0:7:3,607 --> 0:7:7,166
And it just looks like it could be a footprint made yesterday.


89
0:7:7,166 --> 0:7:15,86
And yet it's about 20,000 years old.


90
0:7:15,86 --> 0:7:19,406
So is this when people first reached Australia,


91
0:7:19,406 --> 0:7:23,966
long after we colonised Europe and Asia?


92
0:7:23,966 --> 0:7:33,487
It would certainly make sense, given how far away Australia is.


93
0:7:33,487 --> 0:7:37,326
But I've been told that there is other evidence around here


94
0:7:37,326 --> 0:7:41,86
that could turn this idea upside down.


95
0:7:41,86 --> 0:7:45,687
What I'm looking for are the remains of an extinct beast,


96
0:7:45,687 --> 0:7:49,7
the giant kangaroo.


97
0:7:49,7 --> 0:7:54,247
It's just about midday here and it's very hot.


98
0:7:54,247 --> 0:7:59,846
All right, what's that?


99
0:7:59,846 --> 0:8:1,406
That is a stick.


100
0:8:1,406 --> 0:8:2,807
I spotted that in the distance and thought,


101
0:8:2,807 --> 0:8:5,687
''Oh, right, could that be a giant kangaroo?''


102
0:8:5,687 --> 0:8:9,286
It's not, it's a stick.


103
0:8:9,286 --> 0:8:11,447
Lots of little bits.


104
0:8:11,447 --> 0:8:12,646
So this thing I've picked up is


105
0:8:12,646 --> 0:8:27,86
one of the long foot bones of a modern kangaroo.


106
0:8:27,86 --> 0:8:31,326
Oh, look.


107
0:8:31,326 --> 0:8:34,287
Right, so we've got two bits to it.


108
0:8:34,287 --> 0:8:39,807
And if I put those together like that, that is the toe bone


109
0:8:39,807 --> 0:8:43,86
of an ancient giant kangaroo.


110
0:8:43,86 --> 0:8:46,126
Now, if we look at that end, you can see that


111
0:8:46,126 --> 0:8:48,726
basically it's the same bone as this one,


112
0:8:48,726 --> 0:8:51,527
but this one belongs to a much chunkier animal.


113
0:8:51,527 --> 0:8:52,687
They're actually similar length,


114
0:8:52,687 --> 0:8:55,246
if you imagine sort of the end on that as well.


115
0:8:55,246 --> 0:8:57,767
But you can just see how much chunkier that is.


116
0:8:57,767 --> 0:9:6,647
And you can imagine how much heavier that animal would have been.


117
0:9:6,647 --> 0:9:18,886
Giant kangaroos could grow up to 2.5 metres tall.


118
0:9:18,886 --> 0:9:21,807
But they seem to have become extinct


119
0:9:21,807 --> 0:9:27,767
shortly after 50,000 years ago.


120
0:9:27,767 --> 0:9:39,6
Could this possibly have been due to a new predator arriving on the scene?


121
0:9:39,6 --> 0:9:41,807
If so, it would mean that we humans


122
0:9:41,807 --> 0:9:46,287
arrived here much earlier than 20,000 years ago.


123
0:9:46,287 --> 0:9:49,647
And there is something - or rather someone -


124
0:9:49,647 --> 0:9:54,287
who could support such an early arrival.


125
0:9:54,287 --> 0:10:2,86
Mungo Man.


126
0:10:2,86 --> 0:10:7,6
This is the skull of Mungo Man.


127
0:10:7,6 --> 0:10:8,486
And these bones


128
0:10:8,486 --> 0:10:12,927
are the most ancient human remains that have ever been found in Australia.


129
0:10:12,927 --> 0:10:15,407
And they are incredibly old.


130
0:10:15,407 --> 0:10:19,447
The most conservative estimates put them at 40,000 years old,


131
0:10:19,447 --> 0:10:24,486
and some people say they might be up to 60,000 years old.


132
0:10:24,486 --> 0:10:26,687
Now, that's quite extraordinary,


133
0:10:26,687 --> 0:10:31,126
because it would mean that modern humans were in Australia


134
0:10:31,126 --> 0:10:36,167
before they reached Europe.


135
0:10:36,167 --> 0:10:38,407
Which seems highly unlikely.


136
0:10:38,407 --> 0:10:42,647
Not only is Australia so much further from Africa than Europe is,


137
0:10:42,647 --> 0:10:48,807
there's an ocean to cross.


138
0:10:48,807 --> 0:10:51,407
So unlikely does the journey seem


139
0:10:51,407 --> 0:10:58,846
that some scientists have poured doubt on it.


140
0:10:58,846 --> 0:11:9,886
Instead, they suggest that Australians somehow evolved locally.


141
0:11:9,886 --> 0:11:13,567
And it really is a mystery.


142
0:11:13,567 --> 0:11:17,527
The problem is that there is very little physical evidence


143
0:11:17,527 --> 0:11:21,366
to show that this route from Africa all the way to Australia


144
0:11:21,366 --> 0:11:23,126
was ever taken.


145
0:11:23,126 --> 0:11:27,287
It's one of the biggest puzzles of our human journey.


146
0:11:27,287 --> 0:11:30,6
There's only one way to solve this mystery,


147
0:11:30,6 --> 0:11:36,167
and that's to go back to the beginning of the trail.


148
0:11:36,167 --> 0:11:39,126
To Africa.


149
0:11:39,126 --> 0:11:43,246
Previously, I saw evidence suggesting that most of us descend


150
0:11:43,246 --> 0:11:49,886
from a tiny group of people who left the continent around 70,000 years ago.


151
0:11:49,886 --> 0:11:53,726
one theory is that those families crossed the Red Sea,


152
0:11:53,726 --> 0:11:58,366
and then pushed east, hugging the shoreline.


153
0:11:58,366 --> 0:12:9,927
Then they would have probably trekked along the Indian coast.


154
0:12:9,927 --> 0:12:13,287
So that's the first place to look for evidence


155
0:12:13,287 --> 0:12:16,407
of this journey towards Australia.


156
0:12:16,407 --> 0:12:20,927
(CHANTING IN LOCAL LANGUAGE)


157
0:12:20,927 --> 0:12:26,807
It would be absolutely fantastic to have a trail of stone tools and human fossils


158
0:12:26,807 --> 0:12:29,86
all the way along the coast of India.


159
0:12:29,86 --> 0:12:32,126
Sadly, there just isn't.


160
0:12:32,126 --> 0:12:38,326
Along thousands of miles of coastline, nothing.


161
0:12:38,326 --> 0:12:43,407
But maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.


162
0:12:43,407 --> 0:12:46,246
I've heard that some new evidence has been unearthed


163
0:12:46,246 --> 0:12:48,606
in a very remote part of India.


164
0:12:48,606 --> 0:12:51,366
(TYRE BLOWS)


165
0:12:51,366 --> 0:12:57,527
one which is proving tricky to get to.


166
0:12:57,527 --> 0:13:8,326
Might hitch a ride on one of these tuk-tuks instead.


167
0:13:8,326 --> 0:13:11,807
There is some real evidence turning up right now


168
0:13:11,807 --> 0:13:15,6
at an archaeological site a very long way from the coast.


169
0:13:15,6 --> 0:13:34,246
It's called Jwalapuram, and it's right in the heart of southern India.


170
0:13:34,246 --> 0:13:40,167
From here, it's a beautiful fertile valley,


171
0:13:40,167 --> 0:13:49,886
but just under the surface is a thick layer of white ash.


172
0:13:49,886 --> 0:13:54,606
Today, it is mined by poor families from the village of Jwalapuram,


173
0:13:54,606 --> 0:13:57,606
who sell the ash to chemical companies.


174
0:13:57,606 --> 0:14:2,567
But the ash itself has an incredible story to tell.


175
0:14:2,567 --> 0:14:7,927
(VOLCANO RUMBLING)


176
0:14:7,927 --> 0:14:19,366
It starts thousands of years ago, when Mount Toba on Sumatra erupted.


177
0:14:19,366 --> 0:14:23,486
A supervolcano.


178
0:14:23,486 --> 0:14:30,366
The most devastating eruption in human experience.


179
0:14:30,366 --> 0:14:35,126
The ash cloud was blown over 2,000 kilometres northwest,


180
0:14:35,126 --> 0:14:43,486
reaching as far as India.


181
0:14:43,486 --> 0:14:45,6
Just imagine what it would've been like,


182
0:14:45,6 --> 0:14:47,927
a lush landscape suddenly transformed.


183
0:14:47,927 --> 0:14:51,687
Clouds of ash in the air, choking plant and animal life.


184
0:14:51,687 --> 0:14:54,647
It would have been an environmental disaster.


185
0:14:54,647 --> 0:14:56,527
So what can Toba tell us?


186
0:14:56,527 --> 0:15:2,6
Well, we have a precise date. Toba erupted 74,000 years ago.


187
0:15:2,6 --> 0:15:6,886
The question for us is, had modern humans reached India


188
0:15:6,886 --> 0:15:11,527
by the time it happened?


189
0:15:11,527 --> 0:15:15,86
Until recently, the answer was no,


190
0:15:15,86 --> 0:15:18,886
but a new discovery could change that.


191
0:15:18,886 --> 0:15:22,807
Indian archaeologists have joined forces with Mike Petraglia


192
0:15:22,807 --> 0:15:28,687
from Cambridge University.


193
0:15:28,687 --> 0:15:30,807
-MIKE: It does look like a blade. -Yes, sir.


194
0:15:30,807 --> 0:15:33,366
But most importantly, there's retouch all along here.


195
0:15:33,366 --> 0:15:34,687
Yeah, retouch. Yes.


196
0:15:34,687 --> 0:15:36,927
And it looks like an end scraper.


197
0:15:36,927 --> 0:15:39,767
ROBERTS: And Mike is making some surprising claims


198
0:15:39,767 --> 0:15:43,6
from what they found deep in the ash.


199
0:15:43,6 --> 0:15:45,86
So this is the Toba super-eruption,


200
0:15:45,86 --> 0:15:49,407
the deposit that we have representing the ash fall.


201
0:15:49,407 --> 0:15:51,647
ROBERTS: That's a huge amount of ash.


202
0:15:51,647 --> 0:15:54,206
Yeah, it's about 2 metres' worth of ash.


203
0:15:54,206 --> 0:15:57,927
And the bottom part is what we call the primary ash.


204
0:15:57,927 --> 0:16:0,206
So this is still ash down here, this grey stuff.


205
0:16:0,206 --> 0:16:2,366
Yeah. You see there's very sharp contact.


206
0:16:2,366 --> 0:16:7,606
The beginning of the ash starts here and it goes up,


207
0:16:7,606 --> 0:16:9,527
all the way up to 2 metres.


208
0:16:9,527 --> 0:16:11,886
And what's so striking is that we have


209
0:16:11,886 --> 0:16:14,567
so many spectacular artefacts coming out.


210
0:16:14,567 --> 0:16:16,6
ROBERTS: That's like a little spearhead.


211
0:16:16,6 --> 0:16:17,726
MIKE: Yes, that's exactly what it is.


212
0:16:17,726 --> 0:16:21,326
We think it's actually the tip to a spear.


213
0:16:21,326 --> 0:16:22,486
-Yeah. -And what's so interesting


214
0:16:22,486 --> 0:16:25,486
about this particular piece is the tip is broken,


215
0:16:25,486 --> 0:16:29,447
and so we know the spear was launched and it broke in use.


216
0:16:29,447 --> 0:16:31,966
Now, what's important about this particular piece


217
0:16:31,966 --> 0:16:36,486
is it occurs in deposits below the ash at 78,000 years ago.


218
0:16:36,486 --> 0:16:37,647
So you know the date of it?


219
0:16:37,647 --> 0:16:39,687
We know very precisely the date of it.


220
0:16:39,687 --> 0:16:43,126
It's in between 78,000 and 74,000 years ago.


221
0:16:43,126 --> 0:16:44,886
That's a very, very early date, Mike.


222
0:16:44,886 --> 0:16:47,687
Yes, and the importance of that date


223
0:16:47,687 --> 0:16:52,687
is that these spear points are also found in North Africa,


224
0:16:52,687 --> 0:16:55,687
anywhere between 90 and 60,000 years ago.


225
0:16:55,687 --> 0:17:1,6
So our point fits exactly with that age range.


226
0:17:1,6 --> 0:17:5,166
ROBERTS: Mike believes this is good evidence that our ancestors were here.


227
0:17:5,166 --> 0:17:8,207
(RUMBLING)


228
0:17:8,207 --> 0:17:11,86
But could they have survived this,


229
0:17:11,86 --> 0:17:15,7
a supervolcano?


230
0:17:15,7 --> 0:17:18,126
Well, along with that one stone point


231
0:17:18,126 --> 0:17:22,767
the team have found many other types of tool.


232
0:17:22,767 --> 0:17:28,326
We have continuity of the tools, found both below the ash and above the ash.


233
0:17:28,326 --> 0:17:31,646
So we have literally hundreds of artefacts that look rather similar.


234
0:17:31,646 --> 0:17:37,767
Right. Does that mean that the human population that was here below the ash


235
0:17:37,767 --> 0:17:40,207
survived the Toba super-eruption?


236
0:17:40,207 --> 0:17:41,567
MIKE: Yes, that's our argument,


237
0:17:41,567 --> 0:17:44,926
that whoever was here survived the Toba super-eruption.


238
0:17:44,926 --> 0:17:47,646
Even though this was a major event,


239
0:17:47,646 --> 0:17:52,247
it had an effect on those populations, but those populations survived


240
0:17:52,247 --> 0:17:57,126
through the volcanic event.


241
0:17:57,126 --> 0:18:0,567
ROBERTS: But were these tools really left by our species?


242
0:18:0,567 --> 0:18:3,767
There are plenty of scientists who won't be persuaded


243
0:18:3,767 --> 0:18:11,126
until the team find more evidence, such as human bones.


244
0:18:11,126 --> 0:18:15,646
But I must say, I'm personally quite convinced by the evidence here.


245
0:18:15,646 --> 0:18:21,287
So Jwalapuram at 78,000 years is my first milestone


246
0:18:21,287 --> 0:18:24,166
on the route eastwards out of Africa.


247
0:18:24,166 --> 0:18:31,207
So where did they go next?


248
0:18:31,207 --> 0:18:36,287
At last, a hint that our early ancestors may have come this way.


249
0:18:36,287 --> 0:18:40,126
Perhaps some of those families who survived Toba


250
0:18:40,126 --> 0:18:44,446
began to slowly spread across the continent.


251
0:18:44,446 --> 0:18:48,926
So it's not really a journey in the conventional sense,


252
0:18:48,926 --> 0:18:52,686
because although I'm certainly covering a lot of ground here


253
0:18:52,686 --> 0:18:57,926
trying to recapture the movements that these early humans


254
0:18:57,926 --> 0:19:1,527
made across the landscape, really what we're talking about is


255
0:19:1,527 --> 0:19:3,846
population expansion.


256
0:19:3,846 --> 0:19:7,47
Pressure of numbers and competition for resources.


257
0:19:7,47 --> 0:19:9,47
And the natural thing to do is


258
0:19:9,47 --> 0:19:12,567
for people to spread out across the landscape.


259
0:19:12,567 --> 0:19:15,487
And you can just imagine family groups sort of splitting off


260
0:19:15,487 --> 0:19:18,406
and just moving away in all directions,


261
0:19:18,406 --> 0:19:28,47
and the genetic tree gradually growing and spreading out as well.


262
0:19:28,47 --> 0:19:32,166
But behind that wave of colonisation pushing eastwards,


263
0:19:32,166 --> 0:19:35,606
some families would have stayed where they were


264
0:19:35,606 --> 0:19:39,47
and put down roots.


265
0:19:39,47 --> 0:19:42,366
And maybe it's the people that stayed put


266
0:19:42,366 --> 0:19:46,606
who could provide the next clue.


267
0:19:46,606 --> 0:19:51,567
The countries around the Indian ocean are dotted with remote tribes


268
0:19:51,567 --> 0:19:55,487
who look very different to everyone else.


269
0:19:55,487 --> 0:20:0,886
Could they shed any light on the first colonisers?


270
0:20:0,886 --> 0:20:11,926
To investigate, I'm on my way to Malaysia.


271
0:20:11,926 --> 0:20:15,326
What an amazing city.


272
0:20:15,326 --> 0:20:34,47
The cosmopolitan capital, Kuala Lumpur.


273
0:20:34,47 --> 0:20:42,86
But a few hours away there's a completely different world...


274
0:20:42,86 --> 0:20:48,646
and a small group of people hanging on to a traditional life.


275
0:20:48,646 --> 0:20:55,926
Could they be a relic of that first migration east from Africa?


276
0:20:55,926 --> 0:21:3,527
The Semang tribes are believed to be the most ancient people in Malaysia.


277
0:21:3,527 --> 0:21:14,287
And they do look different from other Malaysians.


278
0:21:14,287 --> 0:21:18,287
Now, this is a selection of typical Malaysian faces.


279
0:21:18,287 --> 0:21:22,86
And you can see these people are quite light-skinned,


280
0:21:22,86 --> 0:21:26,247
quite East Asian-looking in their appearance.


281
0:21:26,247 --> 0:21:28,567
And this is a Semang man.


282
0:21:28,567 --> 0:21:31,247
And the Semang are completely different-looking.


283
0:21:31,247 --> 0:21:32,406
They live in Malaysia,


284
0:21:32,406 --> 0:21:34,606
but they don't look like the rest of the population at all.


285
0:21:34,606 --> 0:21:36,126
They're much darker-skinned.


286
0:21:36,126 --> 0:21:37,846
Some people have even gone as far


287
0:21:37,846 --> 0:21:40,567
as to say that they look African in appearance.


288
0:21:40,567 --> 0:21:44,446
And I just wonder whether their appearance is telling us something


289
0:21:44,446 --> 0:21:50,606
about their ancient ancestry.


290
0:21:50,606 --> 0:21:53,567
The rainforest is disappearing around them


291
0:21:53,567 --> 0:21:58,47
and many now work on rubber plantations and logging camps.


292
0:21:58,47 --> 0:22:4,727
But they are still proud of their hunter-gatherer traditions.

They're so stealthy.

And I'm stepping on twigs and things.

302
0:23:2,166 --> 0:23:5,126
Oh, it's just brilliant. They're all just wedged under this rock,


303
0:23:5,126 --> 0:23:8,166
desperately scrambling underneath it, trying to get those fish.


304
0:23:8,166 --> 0:23:16,366
(LAUGHING) He's tiny!


305
0:23:16,366 --> 0:23:18,7
They're actually underwater now,


306
0:23:18,7 --> 0:23:20,686
just feeling around under stones and grabbing these fish.


307
0:23:20,686 --> 0:23:22,406
And the whole thing is just great fun.

310
0:23:30,886 --> 0:23:35,606
And it's very sad that it's a way of life that isn't


311
0:23:35,606 --> 0:23:40,807
going to be possible for much longer, I don't think.


312
0:23:40,807 --> 0:23:45,326
But the most revealing clue isn't the Semang's way of life


313
0:23:45,326 --> 0:23:48,727
or their appearance.


314
0:23:48,727 --> 0:23:55,767
It's invisible to the naked eye, hidden inside them.


315
0:23:55,767 --> 0:24:0,326
Amazingly, through their DNA it might be possible


316
0:24:0,326 --> 0:24:6,406
to trace that first great journey through Malaysia.


317
0:24:6,406 --> 0:24:11,166
Genetics expert Stephen oppenheimer has flown in from oxford.


318
0:24:11,166 --> 0:24:17,406
His work is helping revolutionise the story of our human journey.


319
0:24:17,406 --> 0:24:19,326
STEPHEN: I guess it's something like a detective story,


320
0:24:19,326 --> 0:24:23,527
where you've got a very specific trail, which you can measure,


321
0:24:23,527 --> 0:24:26,567
just like traditional trackers,


322
0:24:26,567 --> 0:24:30,166
where they'll follow a trail which nobody else could see.

0:24:30,166 --> 0:24:32,406
ROBERTS: Combining genes and geography,


324
0:24:32,406 --> 0:24:36,166
Stephen has mapped out a route from Africa, across the Red Sea


325
0:24:36,166 --> 0:24:39,527
and around the edge of the Indian ocean.


326
0:24:39,527 --> 0:24:42,126
By looking at the DNA of the Semang,


327
0:24:42,126 --> 0:24:46,967
Stephen hopes to find evidence of that early migration towards Australia.


328
0:24:46,967 --> 0:24:49,366
STEPHEN: The new genetics is extraordinarily powerful


329
0:24:49,366 --> 0:24:51,767
for looking at ancient migrations,


330
0:24:51,767 --> 0:24:55,446
because not only can you trace very specific migrations,


331
0:24:55,446 --> 0:24:58,807
but you can actually attempt to date them as well.

(SINGING IN LOCAL LANGUAGE)


334
0:25:8,247 --> 0:25:11,807
ROBERTS: Stephen has been looking for unique genetic markers


335
0:25:11,807 --> 0:25:19,166
that will tell him when the ancestors of the Semang first arrived here.


336
0:25:19,166 --> 0:25:22,567
What about dates? Because they certainly think they've been here forever.


337
0:25:22,567 --> 0:25:24,326
-They think they're very ancient. -I agree with them.


338
0:25:24,326 --> 0:25:25,446
-You do? -Yes.


339
0:25:25,446 --> 0:25:28,686
So they've been here 60,000 years? The ancestors have been here...


340
0:25:28,686 --> 0:25:31,846
STEPHEN: At least 60,000. I suspect it was much, much more.


341
0:25:31,846 --> 0:25:37,567
I mean, that's amazing, 'cause if their uniqueness goes back that far,


342
0:25:37,567 --> 0:25:40,207
and, you know, if we can say that they have


343
0:25:40,207 --> 0:25:44,846
probably been here in this sort of area for 60,000 years,


344
0:25:44,846 --> 0:25:49,527
that means they were very close to the wave of colonisation, doesn't it?


345
0:25:49,527 --> 0:25:52,366
They were part of it. They were in the vanguard.


346
0:25:52,366 --> 0:25:54,207
-Yeah. -They were just a colony dropped


347
0:25:54,207 --> 0:26:1,7
along the way as the vanguard advanced down towards New Guinea and Australia.


348
0:26:1,7 --> 0:26:4,567
ROBERTS: It's incredibly frustrating that the first family groups


349
0:26:4,567 --> 0:26:9,446
pushing through these new lands left so little for us to find.


350
0:26:9,446 --> 0:26:12,646
But genetics has come to the rescue.


351
0:26:12,646 --> 0:26:16,886
Stephen's research tells us that the ancestors of the Semang were probably


352
0:26:16,886 --> 0:26:20,7
amongst the first modern humans to come through here.


353
0:26:20,7 --> 0:26:23,207
And not only that, the genetics suggests that


354
0:26:23,207 --> 0:26:26,247
that vanguard moved surprisingly rapidly,


355
0:26:26,247 --> 0:26:28,926
getting all the way from Africa to Malaysia


356
0:26:28,926 --> 0:26:34,207
in the space of just a few thousand years.


357
0:26:34,207 --> 0:26:37,926
There are other tribes thought to have ancient roots as well.


358
0:26:37,926 --> 0:26:42,767
Together they are like distant echoes of that first migration,


359
0:26:42,767 --> 0:26:47,446
a journey that began in Africa, continued through India


360
0:26:47,446 --> 0:26:50,767
and round the coast to Malaysia.


361
0:26:50,767 --> 0:26:53,166
But did they carry on?


362
0:26:53,166 --> 0:26:57,47
After the Malay Peninsula, the land runs out,


363
0:26:57,47 --> 0:27:9,646
breaking into a mass of islands.


364
0:27:9,646 --> 0:27:13,207
But using a computer program which models past climate,


365
0:27:13,207 --> 0:27:15,686
it's possible to go back in time


366
0:27:15,686 --> 0:27:20,487
and see what the map looked like thousands of years ago.


367
0:27:20,487 --> 0:27:24,47
And if we run the climate computer back through time -


368
0:27:24,47 --> 0:27:27,567
we're racing through tens of thousands of years here -


369
0:27:27,567 --> 0:27:30,527
we can see that those islands are starting to join up.


370
0:27:30,527 --> 0:27:32,47
And in fact a lot of the islands


371
0:27:32,47 --> 0:27:35,326
that make up modern-day Malaysia and Indonesia


372
0:27:35,326 --> 0:27:42,487
are all joining together to become part of the continent.


373
0:27:42,487 --> 0:27:46,86
They could have got all the way here to Borneo


374
0:27:46,86 --> 0:27:51,606
without getting their feet wet.


375
0:27:51,606 --> 0:27:56,967
So much may be lost under the sea.


376
0:27:56,967 --> 0:28:6,446
But there is something.


377
0:28:6,446 --> 0:28:10,767
During the Second World War, Englishman Major Tom Harrison


378
0:28:10,767 --> 0:28:14,846
parachuted into Borneo on a special-forces mission.


379
0:28:14,846 --> 0:28:19,646
He encouraged local tribes to use the ancient practice of headhunting


380
0:28:19,646 --> 0:28:28,406
against the Japanese.


381
0:28:28,406 --> 0:28:37,767
After the war, Harrison, a keen archaeologist, stayed on...


382
0:28:37,767 --> 0:28:48,527
and began investigating the legendary Niah cave.


383
0:28:48,527 --> 0:28:52,646
Oh, I've seen pictures of the great cave at Niah,


384
0:28:52,646 --> 0:29:38,967
but nothing really prepares you for the sheer scale of it.


385
0:29:38,967 --> 0:29:41,926
Harrison launched a major excavation.


386
0:29:41,926 --> 0:29:44,126
He had a hunch that these caves


387
0:29:44,126 --> 0:29:54,926
would have made the perfect home for early humans.


388
0:29:54,926 --> 0:29:58,686
This part of the excavation was known as ''Hell Trench''.


389
0:29:58,686 --> 0:30:1,47
And stepping down into it, it's easy to see why,


390
0:30:1,47 --> 0:30:4,527
because it's suddenly very hot and humid.


391
0:30:4,527 --> 0:30:7,487
But all the hard work and the discomfort paid off,


392
0:30:7,487 --> 0:30:10,207
because the archaeologists found something


393
0:30:10,207 --> 0:30:13,247
that was quite phenomenal.


394
0:30:13,247 --> 0:30:15,326
It's a human skull.


395
0:30:15,326 --> 0:30:18,646
It was in many pieces when it was first found,


396
0:30:18,646 --> 0:30:23,287
which have been carefully fitted back together like a jigsaw.


397
0:30:23,287 --> 0:30:25,247
And this is the top of the skull.


398
0:30:25,247 --> 0:30:31,207
It's unmistakably a modern human, it has a high, domed forehead.


399
0:30:31,207 --> 0:30:36,86
The skull has been dated to nearly 40,000 years old,


400
0:30:36,86 --> 0:30:44,287
the oldest confirmed remains of our species in Southeast Asia.


401
0:30:44,287 --> 0:30:49,326
But Niah cave also offers us a clue as to how these people survived


402
0:30:49,326 --> 0:30:53,926
in the challenging environment of the rainforest.


403
0:30:53,926 --> 0:30:58,527
(BIRDS SCREECHING)


404
0:30:58,527 --> 0:31:0,646
As you move just a little bit deeper into the cave,


405
0:31:0,646 --> 0:31:3,727
it becomes significantly cooler and more pleasant.


406
0:31:3,727 --> 0:31:6,646
And it just feels like an ideal place for those hunter-gatherers


407
0:31:6,646 --> 0:31:8,326
to have set up their camps.


408
0:31:8,326 --> 0:31:11,126
And then they could have gone off roaming into the forest.


409
0:31:11,126 --> 0:31:13,567
The archaeological evidence shows that they were bringing back


410
0:31:13,567 --> 0:31:16,326
a huge range of different foods to eat,


411
0:31:16,326 --> 0:31:23,207
from monkeys and pigs and lizards, to shellfish, yams and sago palm.


412
0:31:23,207 --> 0:31:27,446
Compared with other species, we're incredibly adaptable.


413
0:31:27,446 --> 0:31:32,606
To survive, we humans will eat just about anything.


414
0:31:32,606 --> 0:31:36,527
And as if to make exactly that point, in another corner of the cave


415
0:31:36,527 --> 0:31:41,326
something really unusual is going on.


416
0:31:41,326 --> 0:31:46,287
I've arrived at harvesting time for the ingredient used in the Chinese delicacy


417
0:31:46,287 --> 0:31:47,886
bird's nest soup.


418
0:31:47,886 --> 0:31:50,646
It's made from the nests of rare swiftlets,


419
0:31:50,646 --> 0:31:56,846
and today these men are attempting a death-defying feat to gather them.


420
0:31:56,846 --> 0:32:10,86
Well, this is human ingenuity, isn't it?


421
0:32:10,86 --> 0:32:12,247
A sweet little tiny swiftlet's nest.


422
0:32:12,247 --> 0:32:16,86
It has just been built out from the wall of the cave.


423
0:32:16,86 --> 0:32:19,86
Made of saliva.


424
0:32:19,86 --> 0:32:23,406
It feels a bit like resin or something. It's very odd.


425
0:32:23,406 --> 0:32:29,487
I can't believe that anybody would want to make soup out of it.


426
0:32:29,487 --> 0:32:33,366
The ability to survive in the rainforest would have helped people


427
0:32:33,366 --> 0:32:35,646
spread through these islands.


428
0:32:35,646 --> 0:32:40,606
But discoveries on Flores suggest there may have been another challenge


429
0:32:40,606 --> 0:32:48,727
for the first modern humans in this part of the world.


430
0:32:48,727 --> 0:32:52,126
The Indonesian jungle is full of life.


431
0:32:52,126 --> 0:32:55,446
There are animals in there of every shape and size,


432
0:32:55,446 --> 0:32:58,686
some of them more friendly than others.


433
0:32:58,686 --> 0:33:1,86
(GROWLING)


434
0:33:1,86 --> 0:33:4,86
Every year more species are discovered,


435
0:33:4,86 --> 0:33:7,807
and the jungle still has secrets to reveal.


436
0:33:7,807 --> 0:33:11,846
It seems that however much we think we know


437
0:33:11,846 --> 0:33:15,166
about the other creatures we share the planet with,


438
0:33:15,166 --> 0:33:22,807
there are always new surprises.


439
0:33:22,807 --> 0:33:29,926
Today on Flores, local people still tell stories of strange human-like creatures,


440
0:33:29,926 --> 0:33:34,7
the cave-dwelling Ebu Gogo.


441
0:33:34,7 --> 0:33:39,366
So I'd really, really like to know more about the story of Ebu Gogo.


442
0:33:39,366 --> 0:33:41,846
(SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE)


443
0:33:41,846 --> 0:33:44,326
MAN: According to our ancestors,


444
0:33:44,326 --> 0:33:48,247
there were Ebu Gogo in our land, in our village, a long time ago.


445
0:33:48,247 --> 0:33:50,727
Around the 1 5th century.


446
0:33:50,727 --> 0:33:54,727
Are they humans? I mean, are they like us?


447
0:33:54,727 --> 0:33:57,727
MAN: They had two distinctive characteristics -


448
0:33:57,727 --> 0:34:4,487
they were like monkeys, but also like humans.


449
0:34:4,487 --> 0:34:11,286
Their physical features were short, hefty,


450
0:34:11,286 --> 0:34:14,126
with long hair on the head and chest,


451
0:34:14,126 --> 0:34:20,567
and the females' breasts were big and long.


452
0:34:20,567 --> 0:34:22,246
If they wanted to walk,


453
0:34:22,246 --> 0:34:31,766
they usually threw their long breasts over their shoulders.


454
0:34:31,766 --> 0:34:36,367
But nobody's seen one for a couple of hundred years?


455
0:34:36,367 --> 0:34:41,726
MAN: They really did exist, and they were destroyed by our ancestors


456
0:34:41,726 --> 0:34:45,367
about seven generations ago.


457
0:34:45,367 --> 0:34:49,7
(SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE)


458
0:34:49,7 --> 0:34:52,646
MAN: There were two reasons for their elimination.


459
0:34:52,646 --> 0:34:54,847
Firstly, because they stole food,


460
0:34:54,847 --> 0:35:1,206
and secondly, because they kidnapped our children.


461
0:35:1,206 --> 0:35:7,286
ROBERTS: This sounds like the sort of spooky myths you might hear anywhere.


462
0:35:7,286 --> 0:35:19,47
But believe it or not, this story may actually have some truth to it.


463
0:35:19,47 --> 0:35:22,766
Archaeologists were excavating in this cave on the island,


464
0:35:22,766 --> 0:35:25,806
looking for signs of the earliest modern humans,


465
0:35:25,806 --> 0:35:29,447
when they made a startling discovery.


466
0:35:29,447 --> 0:35:33,47
At first they thought they'd found the skeleton of a child.


467
0:35:33,47 --> 0:35:34,887
But when they cleaned up the bones,


468
0:35:34,887 --> 0:35:39,487
they realised it was actually a tiny adult.


469
0:35:39,487 --> 0:35:43,86
A small-bodied, small-brained creature,


470
0:35:43,86 --> 0:35:47,726
a type of human that nobody had ever seen before.


471
0:35:47,726 --> 0:35:53,927
It quickly became known as ''The Hobbit''.


472
0:35:53,927 --> 0:35:57,927
So this is the skeleton of this minute woman


473
0:35:57,927 --> 0:35:59,166
that the archaeologists found


474
0:35:59,166 --> 0:36:2,166
in the cave of Liang Bua on the island of Flores.


475
0:36:2,166 --> 0:36:4,887
And she is just absolutely tiny.


476
0:36:4,887 --> 0:36:6,806
When she was standing at her full height,


477
0:36:6,806 --> 0:36:9,806
she would have reached to about a metre tall.


478
0:36:9,806 --> 0:36:12,166
She seems like an odd combination.


479
0:36:12,166 --> 0:36:14,726
Some bits look like us, but in miniature,


480
0:36:14,726 --> 0:36:19,47
other parts look like more ancient human species.


481
0:36:19,47 --> 0:36:23,47
People still are unsure about exactly who she is.


482
0:36:23,47 --> 0:36:25,967
Most people believe that she is, indeed, a different species.


483
0:36:25,967 --> 0:36:30,206
So it really does make us rethink what we think about ourselves


484
0:36:30,206 --> 0:36:34,606
and what we think about the whole human family as well.


485
0:36:34,606 --> 0:36:38,86
Could The Hobbit have affected our ancestors'journey?


486
0:36:38,86 --> 0:36:40,766
Dating of the bones shows they were here


487
0:36:40,766 --> 0:36:47,126
around the time of the migration of our ancestors through Indonesia.


488
0:36:47,126 --> 0:36:49,847
So would they have encountered this race,


489
0:36:49,847 --> 0:36:53,166
this population of very tiny people?


490
0:36:53,166 --> 0:36:55,606
And what would have happened if they did?


491
0:36:55,606 --> 0:37:3,86
I don't know what they would have thought about Homo sapiens.


492
0:37:3,86 --> 0:37:6,567
If they really were the vicious Ebu Gogo,


493
0:37:6,567 --> 0:37:17,166
our ancestors might have been best advised to avoid Flores.


494
0:37:17,166 --> 0:37:21,447
But to reach Australia, those early pioneers would have had to face


495
0:37:21,447 --> 0:37:23,686
the greatest challenge of all,


496
0:37:23,686 --> 0:37:29,246
one that was there even 60,000 years ago.


497
0:37:29,246 --> 0:37:38,246
The deep seas around Australia.


498
0:37:38,246 --> 0:37:40,7
I've arrived in Lombok,


499
0:37:40,7 --> 0:37:53,206
one of a string of Indonesian islands, stepping stones to Australia.


500
0:37:53,206 --> 0:37:57,606
Nobody's ever found evidence of a boat from this long ago,


501
0:37:57,606 --> 0:37:59,606
but Austrian Robert Bednarik


502
0:37:59,606 --> 0:38:6,887
has been trying to work out what sort of sea craft our ancestors might have had.


503
0:38:6,887 --> 0:38:11,246
He's been building prehistoric rafts for over a decade.


504
0:38:11,246 --> 0:38:13,246
His philosophy is simple..


505
0:38:13,246 --> 0:38:16,166
his rafts can be built with the tools and materials


506
0:38:16,166 --> 0:38:18,806
that would have been available to early humans.


507
0:38:18,806 --> 0:38:23,847
But not all of them have been successful.


508
0:38:23,847 --> 0:38:27,7
That is the most primitive model we've built so far.


509
0:38:27,7 --> 0:38:29,646
This one is the most primitive? Great.


510
0:38:29,646 --> 0:38:37,166
But it's also the most... Hopefully, the most effective.


511
0:38:37,166 --> 0:38:40,286
ROBERTS: I hope so, because I'm going to go on it.


512
0:38:40,286 --> 0:38:42,487
Robert has used something that would have been available


513
0:38:42,487 --> 0:38:45,967
to the first Indonesians, just as it is today -


514
0:38:45,967 --> 0:38:48,447
bamboo.


515
0:38:48,447 --> 0:38:51,567
We know they were clever, so... As clever as us.


516
0:38:51,567 --> 0:38:54,367
So if we look around and go, ''Well, bamboo looks great'' -


517
0:38:54,367 --> 0:38:56,967
I mean, that's a fantastic material to use -


518
0:38:56,967 --> 0:39:0,887
then undoubtedly, you know, they'd have been onto that as well.


519
0:39:0,887 --> 0:39:6,766
We're going to attempt to cross a stretch of open sea to the next island.


520
0:39:6,766 --> 0:39:9,286
It's nothing like the distance to Australia,


521
0:39:9,286 --> 0:39:12,686
but an excellent test of the principle.


522
0:39:12,686 --> 0:39:17,806
The raft is very basic. No sail, no shade.


523
0:39:17,806 --> 0:39:20,967
And nothing to stop the water getting through.


524
0:39:20,967 --> 0:39:24,7
Are we really going to sea on this?


525
0:39:24,7 --> 0:39:26,246
Do they think we're mad, going out on this raft?


526
0:39:26,246 --> 0:39:28,166

And he worry of the current coming and we cannot get there.


539

Okay. What do they think of the rafts compared to their normal boats?


540
0:40:12,447 --> 0:40:14,887
No, they happen like when the boat is...

-What? -Could it capsize?


545
0:40:25,847 --> 0:40:31,606
Yeah.

ROBERTS: The message is clear.

0:40:33,327 --> 0:40:40,487
No matter how well prepared we are, the elements will determine our fate.


548
0:40:40,487 --> 0:40:44,246
Which is why the fishermen won't even contemplate this voyage


549
0:40:44,246 --> 0:40:47,206
without the help of the local mystic.


550
0:40:47,206 --> 0:41:2,646
We all have to be blessed as protection against the spirit of the sea.

Just launching the raft is hard enough. It is incredibly heavy.

It's really heavy,


554
0:41:36,286 --> 0:41:38,487
and it was quite an effort to actually get it into the water,

0:41:38,487 --> 0:41:39,646
but we did it.


556
0:41:39,646 --> 0:41:47,86
And we're now making really good speed.


557
0:41:47,86 --> 0:41:48,206
ROBERTS: Are we headed in the right direction?


558
0:41:48,206 --> 0:41:49,327
MAN: I hope so.


559
0:41:49,327 --> 0:41:51,487
ROBERTS: Yeah. MAN: I hope.


560
0:41:51,487 --> 0:41:56,7
ROBERTS: on a paddle-powered raft, we are totally at the mercy of currents,


561
0:41:56,7 --> 0:42:0,407
just as our ancestors would have been.


562
0:42:0,407 --> 0:42:4,487
We think the current should start pulling us north,


563
0:42:4,487 --> 0:42:8,246
then as we get halfway across, turn south.


564
0:42:8,246 --> 0:42:12,246
So we won't be able to head straight across.


565
0:42:12,246 --> 0:42:21,686
And if we get it wrong, we'll end up in the Indian ocean.


566
0:42:21,686 --> 0:42:27,86
So what does Robert's decidedly non-Stone Age GPS tell us?


567
0:42:27,86 --> 0:42:30,7
-So we're heading north, Robert? -It's excellent.


568
0:42:30,7 --> 0:42:32,47
So we might make it in five hours if we...


569
0:42:32,47 --> 0:42:34,487
No, no, no, we're probably being pulled by the current now.


570
0:42:34,487 --> 0:42:35,766
Right. So you think that...


571
0:42:35,766 --> 0:42:37,806
We're offshore, we're getting this northern current.


572
0:42:37,806 --> 0:42:40,246
So you think the good speed that we're doing is actually the current?


573
0:42:40,246 --> 0:42:41,726
Some of the speed is the current, yes.


574
0:42:41,726 --> 0:42:43,806
Okay? I don't believe that we are actually doing this.


575
0:42:43,806 --> 0:42:45,327
(LAUGHS)


576
0:42:45,327 --> 0:42:47,967
Does anyone know any good paddling songs?


577
0:42:47,967 --> 0:43:15,447
(MAN SINGING IN LOCAL LANGUAGE)


578
0:43:15,447 --> 0:43:17,847
What's going on with the seat?


579
0:43:17,847 --> 0:43:22,286
It makes me wonder how those early sea crossings happened.


580
0:43:22,286 --> 0:43:27,487
Perhaps families were out fishing and got carried off by rogue currents,


581
0:43:27,487 --> 0:43:30,606
and arrived in Australia by chance.


582
0:43:30,606 --> 0:43:34,646
That's better.


583
0:43:34,646 --> 0:43:39,806
or maybe desperation pushed some to look for a new island to live on,


584
0:43:39,806 --> 0:43:42,7
but I doubt it was planned.


585
0:43:42,7 --> 0:43:51,686
Australia was far beyond the horizon.


586
0:43:51,686 --> 0:43:54,166
So are the currents going to change direction now?


587
0:43:54,166 --> 0:43:55,726
-We don't know. -We don't know.


588
0:43:55,726 --> 0:43:57,967
Adds an element of excitement.


589
0:43:57,967 --> 0:44:3,447
Makes it difficult to head for somewhere in particular, though.


590
0:44:3,447 --> 0:44:7,86
At the halfway stage, it all seems rather easy.


591
0:44:7,86 --> 0:44:10,447
The plan is working perfectly.


592
0:44:10,447 --> 0:44:19,206
But over towards Sumbawa, trouble is looming.


593
0:44:19,206 --> 0:44:40,927
ROBERTS: I suddenly feel very small in a very big sea.


594
0:44:40,927 --> 0:44:45,126
our destination is an inviting, sandy beach.


595
0:44:45,126 --> 0:44:47,686
But just a few hundred metres from safety,


596
0:44:47,686 --> 0:44:58,286
we're suddenly trapped in a rip current, pulling us back out to sea.


597
0:44:58,286 --> 0:45:5,567
(ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)


598
0:45:5,567 --> 0:45:7,726
The current just keeps on dragging us from side to side,


599
0:45:7,726 --> 0:45:8,806
and we're headed for this...


600
0:45:8,806 --> 0:45:12,47
There's a beach right up ahead with some big breakers.


601
0:45:12,47 --> 0:45:17,407
I don't speak Indonesian, but they're saying to me we're gonna do that.


602
0:45:17,407 --> 0:45:22,487
And the beach we've been aiming for is looking more and more distant.


603
0:45:22,487 --> 0:45:24,447
The current just swept us round this headland.


604
0:45:24,447 --> 0:45:27,806
We were level with that headland and heading for the beach.


605
0:45:27,806 --> 0:45:29,927
And now we're gonna have to go and try


606
0:45:29,927 --> 0:45:32,806
to go round the other side of the headland. I don't know.


607
0:45:32,806 --> 0:45:35,206
There's massive breakers there.


608
0:45:35,206 --> 0:45:39,206
It's starting to look a bit nasty.


609
0:45:39,206 --> 0:45:43,367
We've been paddling since daybreak, and now it's starting to get dark.


610
0:45:43,367 --> 0:45:45,286
But as far as the eye can see,


611
0:45:45,286 --> 0:45:47,806
there's a line of breakers over a coral reef,


612
0:45:47,806 --> 0:45:51,86
stopping us from landing.


613
0:45:51,86 --> 0:45:56,407
The crew is concerned that there is a continuous coral reef here,


614
0:45:56,407 --> 0:46:2,7
and to get through those breakers we are likely to hit that.


615
0:46:2,7 --> 0:46:5,806
I'm really worried that we're gonna get swept in by these breakers.


616
0:46:5,806 --> 0:46:7,367
We're getting very close.


617
0:46:7,367 --> 0:46:9,367
MAN ON RADIO: Are you getting too close to the rocks?


618
0:46:9,367 --> 0:46:11,206
Copy that. We're getting too close to the rocks.


619
0:46:11,206 --> 0:46:12,606
We're getting too close to the breakers.


620
0:46:12,606 --> 0:46:17,967
We're going to carry on due south, so straight in the direction we're going.


621
0:46:17,967 --> 0:46:59,367
At last, there's a gap in the reef.


622
0:46:59,367 --> 0:47:4,527
We proved it was possible to cross open sea on a bamboo raft,


623
0:47:4,527 --> 0:47:6,806
with no sail or engine.


624
0:47:6,806 --> 0:47:9,447
But it was a frightening experience.


625
0:47:9,447 --> 0:47:13,47
Could our ancestors really have made it to Australia?


626
0:47:13,47 --> 0:47:24,447
Today, that's a crossing of nearly 500 kilometres.


627
0:47:24,447 --> 0:47:27,806
Well, I've found a clue that makes me think they could have done it,


628
0:47:27,806 --> 0:47:32,766
and even hints at when.


629
0:47:32,766 --> 0:47:36,206
Running the climate-change sequence for this part of the world,


630
0:47:36,206 --> 0:47:38,367
I'm particularly interested in what's going on


631
0:47:38,367 --> 0:47:41,726
between 60 and 80,000 years ago,


632
0:47:41,726 --> 0:47:44,527
because that's the time period at which we think


633
0:47:44,527 --> 0:47:48,286
the first Australian colonisers would have been en route.


634
0:47:48,286 --> 0:47:52,606
And there seems to be a remarkable window of opportunity.


635
0:47:52,606 --> 0:47:55,927
At about 65,000 years ago,


636
0:47:55,927 --> 0:48:0,646
the sea level drops about 1 00 metres below its present-day levels.


637
0:48:0,646 --> 0:48:4,847
And the distance between Timor and the northern coast of Australia


638
0:48:4,847 --> 0:48:8,447
is reduced to 1 53 kilometres.


639
0:48:8,447 --> 0:48:11,327
65,000 years ago.


640
0:48:11,327 --> 0:48:19,927
Could this really have been the chance to cross the sea to Australia?


641
0:48:19,927 --> 0:48:21,126
It would make a nice end


642
0:48:21,126 --> 0:48:24,126
to that faint trail of evidence that I followed all the way


643
0:48:24,126 --> 0:48:36,967
through India and Malaysia, but it is only a suggestion.


644
0:48:36,967 --> 0:48:43,806
Can I find any real evidence that this is what happened?


645
0:48:43,806 --> 0:48:46,766
I'm heading through the swamps of the Northern Territories,


646
0:48:46,766 --> 0:48:49,887
because it's here in the north that I hope to find clues


647
0:48:49,887 --> 0:48:58,686
to the earliest Australians.


648
0:48:58,686 --> 0:48:59,967
I am slightly nervous, Gabby,


649
0:48:59,967 --> 0:49:8,447
'cause there are crocodiles around, aren't there?


650
0:49:8,447 --> 0:49:13,126
-Do you think we're safe in this boat? -Yeah, we're pretty safe.


651
0:49:13,126 --> 0:49:15,126
Pretty safe?


652
0:49:15,126 --> 0:49:20,686
(LAUGHING)


653
0:49:20,686 --> 0:49:23,726
This is the point at which Gabby and an entire BBC film crew


654
0:49:23,726 --> 0:49:26,166
put themselves into my hands.


655
0:49:26,166 --> 0:49:28,166
Very slowly.


656
0:49:28,166 --> 0:49:33,206
Getting around in the wet season isn't easy.


657
0:49:33,206 --> 0:49:35,487
There's a fish there.


658
0:49:35,487 --> 0:49:48,47
But at last, this is what I've been looking for.


659
0:49:48,47 --> 0:49:52,487
When you're looking for clues this ancient, they are few and far between.


660
0:49:52,487 --> 0:49:57,327
But this area of Australia is actually rich in a different kind of evidence


661
0:49:57,327 --> 0:49:59,166
of early humans.


662
0:49:59,166 --> 0:50:1,367
Evidence of art.


663
0:50:1,367 --> 0:50:3,606
And this is how the archaeologists know.


664
0:50:3,606 --> 0:50:8,367
Well, this is ochre. And this is ochre in its natural state.


665
0:50:8,367 --> 0:50:11,806
These pebbles form out of the rocks here.


666
0:50:11,806 --> 0:50:14,286
But what the archaeologists have found in a couple of rock shelters


667
0:50:14,286 --> 0:50:16,606
here in the Northern Territories,


668
0:50:16,606 --> 0:50:21,967
is ochre that has been ground down and used as a pigment.


669
0:50:21,967 --> 0:50:30,407
And they've dated the pigments, and some go back almost to 60,000 years ago.


670
0:50:30,407 --> 0:50:34,686
That's not long after sea levels were at their lowest.


671
0:50:34,686 --> 0:50:43,126
People really might have reached Australia by 60,000 years ago.


672
0:50:43,126 --> 0:50:46,726
Those same pigments are still being used today


673
0:50:46,726 --> 0:50:54,367
by Aboriginal Australian artists in recording the stories of their people.


674
0:50:54,367 --> 0:50:58,166
And I'm really keen to meet some of these artists,


675
0:50:58,166 --> 0:51:8,847
to find out more about what their art means to them.


676
0:51:8,847 --> 0:51:13,646
I've heard of remote sacred sites where I might find images


677
0:51:13,646 --> 0:51:17,527
of their creation story.


678
0:51:17,527 --> 0:51:20,887
Artists Garry Djorlom and Wilfred Nawirridj


679
0:51:20,887 --> 0:51:34,766
agree to take me on a trip into the bush.


680
0:51:34,766 --> 0:51:38,86
As we make our journey, they're constantly on the lookout


681
0:51:38,86 --> 0:51:41,407
for anything they can use.


682
0:51:41,407 --> 0:51:54,806
What are you looking for, Wilfred?


683
0:51:54,806 --> 0:52:10,166
ROBERTS: Oh, yeah! Yeah. Instant brush.


684
0:52:10,166 --> 0:52:11,967
It's very strange, because I'm sort of looking round


685
0:52:11,967 --> 0:52:15,806
and just seeing plants everywhere and you're seeing food.


686
0:52:15,806 --> 0:52:18,286
Bush passion fruit, apparently.


687
0:52:18,286 --> 0:52:26,327
That is like a tiny little passion fruit.


688
0:52:26,327 --> 0:52:29,7
Delicious.


689
0:52:29,7 --> 0:52:32,126
Garry and Wilfred's families have become settled,


690
0:52:32,126 --> 0:52:41,567
but they still go off to look for food in the bush just as their ancestors did.


691
0:52:41,567 --> 0:52:44,487
Oh, that's beautiful.


692
0:52:44,487 --> 0:52:47,686
Is it still a special place for you?


693
0:52:47,686 --> 0:52:51,726
ROBERTS: Yeah.


694
0:52:51,726 --> 0:52:55,686
Oh, they lived here?


695
0:52:55,686 --> 0:53:4,447
A long time ago? So grandfathers many generations back? Yeah.


696
0:53:4,447 --> 0:53:9,86
From here I can see a beautiful view.


697
0:53:9,86 --> 0:53:13,726
But for Garry's ancestors this was a place to survey the land,


698
0:53:13,726 --> 0:53:51,206
pick out distant game and plan their meals.


699
0:53:51,206 --> 0:53:54,206
ROBERTS: Eventually, at the entrance to a rock shelter,


700
0:53:54,206 --> 0:54:0,527
we come across our first piece of ancient art.


701
0:54:0,527 --> 0:54:4,887
Oh, that's beautiful.


702
0:54:4,887 --> 0:54:8,47
There's so many images, all sort of on top of each other


703
0:54:8,47 --> 0:54:15,527
and jostling for room.


704
0:54:15,527 --> 0:54:21,646
ROBERTS: Yeah, yeah.


705
0:54:21,646 --> 0:54:29,726
Right. So this all represents the sort of animals that you can eat.


706
0:54:29,726 --> 0:54:41,967
Yeah.


707
0:54:41,967 --> 0:54:46,246
But what they've really brought me here to see is further up the hill,


708
0:54:46,246 --> 0:54:51,327
deep within these rocks.


709
0:54:51,327 --> 0:54:59,447
It's like a maze.


710
0:54:59,447 --> 0:55:7,7

0:55:7,7 --> 0:55:10,7
(SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE)


712
0:55:10,7 --> 0:55:13,646
Okay.


713
0:55:13,646 --> 0:55:16,86
ROBERTS: Oh, wow!


714
0:55:16,86 --> 0:55:24,246
What a strange picture. What is it?


715
0:55:24,246 --> 0:55:27,246
ROBERTS: Right. So all those little bags hanging from her,


716
0:55:27,246 --> 0:55:30,7
they've all got babies in them?


717
0:55:30,7 --> 0:55:48,606
And where did she come from?


718
0:55:48,606 --> 0:55:50,606
ROBERTS: This is remarkable.


719
0:55:50,606 --> 0:55:53,567
Traditionally, Aboriginal Australians believe


720
0:55:53,567 --> 0:55:59,367
they were formed by creative beings who also made their land.


721
0:55:59,367 --> 0:56:2,206
But here on the northern coast


722
0:56:2,206 --> 0:56:6,646
they believe their creation mother came from across the sea.


723
0:56:6,646 --> 0:56:18,726
A strange echo of a story told by fossils, stones and genes.


724
0:56:18,726 --> 0:56:23,327
However unlikely it seemed, discoveries have convinced me


725
0:56:23,327 --> 0:56:27,447
that these Aboriginal Australians, just like me,


726
0:56:27,447 --> 0:56:33,967
are descendants of that small group who left Africa.


727
0:56:33,967 --> 0:56:42,766
And that they really could have reached Australia by around 60,000 years ago.


728
0:56:42,766 --> 0:56:52,286
What seemed an unlikely journey may actually have been one of our first.


729
0:56:52,286 --> 0:56:55,646
So I've come to the end of this particular journey.


730
0:56:55,646 --> 0:56:59,686
And the people I've met along the way have helped me to understand more


731
0:56:59,686 --> 0:57:2,646
about the essential human characteristics


732
0:57:2,646 --> 0:57:4,126
that we all share -


733
0:57:4,126 --> 0:57:8,766
ingenuity, resourcefulness and adaptability.


734
0:57:8,766 --> 0:57:13,86
And for me, the Aboriginal Australians in particular


735
0:57:13,86 --> 0:57:16,847
seem to have held on to something I think so many of us feel we've lost


736
0:57:16,847 --> 0:57:18,887
in the 21 st century,


737
0:57:18,887 --> 0:57:23,686
a really intense physical and spiritual connection


738
0:57:23,686 --> 0:57:27,86
with their landscape and environment.


739
0:57:27,86 --> 0:57:31,206
So it's been a journey about retracing that migration


740
0:57:31,206 --> 0:57:33,927
from Africa to Australia,


741
0:57:33,927 --> 0:59:33,927
but it's also been about what it really means to be human.
