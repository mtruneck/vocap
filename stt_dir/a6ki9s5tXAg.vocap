###29 ROY STAFFORD: All part of the job.
###30 
###35 HARRY STAFFORD: The first race of this season at Jerez, I got
###38 a really good start.
###39 I got second into the first corner.
###42 ROY STAFFORD: He was in a bunch of four or five riders
###45 at the front and the next group were
###48 very, very close behind.
###50 He made a slight mistake at the hairpin.
###52 
###55 Nearly high sided, and then another rider hit him, which
###59 consequently injured him, breaking his collarbone and
###63 having a severe concussion.
###64 
###69 All I could see was what was on the monitor, and I just saw
###74 number 24 rider crashed.
###76 And I was hoping that it said then afterwards, rider okay,
###79 but it didn't.
###81 He was very expertly attended to.
###84 The concussion was the worst.
###86 He had two small blood clots on the front right-hand lobe
###92 of his brain.
###92 This is what they were concerned about.
###95 I hadn't slept from Saturday night, and I
###98 was absolutely shattered.
###101 But when your little boy is in the hospital, and he's
###104 injured, and he might need you at any time,
###106 you can't go to sleep.
###108 The bike came over his shoulder, broke his
###110 collarbone, went up here-- this is Dunlop rubber--
###114 and then glanced off.
###116 So consequently, the helmet cracked here, because of the
###119 side pressure.
###119 This is the first time I've seen it since the crash and
###122 it's the first time Harry had seen it since the crash.
###126 So whether it's brought back any memories, I don't know.
###129 But I wouldn't have thought so, because you can't really
###132 remember much.
###133 HARRY STAFFORD: I can't remember the lights going out
###135 or anything.
###137 Everything was a blank from near enough a week.
###141 And then the last two days in hospital, I just barely
###146 remember that.
###147 I just remember pulling up to the grid.
###150 That's it.
###151 So--
###153 ROY STAFFORD: Yeah, it's taken him two months to fully
###156 recuperate.
###157 But this was on the advice of Red Bull.
###161 HARRY STAFFORD: If you crash and it affects you and you
###163 don't want to ride, then you shouldn't ride.
###165 But I love riding, so I want to get back on the bike as
###169 soon as possible.
###170 [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
###183 ROY STAFFORD: I worry about him all the time, but there's
###187 not a lot you can do about it.
###190 He wants to race motorcycles and that's it.
###195 The minute he says he doesn't want to do it anymore, I shall
###197 say, OK, mate.
###199 Finished, no problem.
###201 
###205 But hopefully I'll never have to say that.
###208 [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REVVING]
###214 
###217 ROY STAFFORD: No.
###219 
###222 HARRY STAFFORD: My mom is really nervous because she
###225 thinks there's something wrong with me now,
###227 because I keep on crashing.
###228 But when you get to ride at this level, and you have to
###233 push hard to ride with the front, you start crashing.
###236 And Gusto tells me that whenever you crash, you learn
###240 from the crash so you know not to do it next time.
###245 I learn a lot.
###246 [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REVVING]
###247 DANNY WALKER: He's down at about 20, and he was 10 for a
###250 little while, and he just hasn't gotten
###251 comfortable with it.
###252 
###255 So I'm hoping-- he's got about 6 minutes left, so we'll see
###257 how things turn around here for him.
###260 Hope he can find something he's comfortable with.
###263 DANNY WALKER: He did?
###265 See?
###265 He was trying, and he just crashed.
###267 
###271 HAYDEN GILLIM: I just shot off the track.
###273 My hands are beat up a little bit.
###275 Some purple, but that's about it.
###279 My leathers got beat up more than I did.
###282 DANNY WALKER: Hayden doesn't do anything just a little bit.
###284 He's got to do it big.
###285 Go big or go home.
###287 HAYDEN GILLIM: This is the first time I crashed.
###289 [INAUDIBLE]
###289 Cup.
###290 The Rookies.
###291 I've only crashed twice on the US.
###293 ROY STAFFORD: You did a 45 flat and then a 44.6, which is
###296 absolutely fantastic.
###298 All right?
###299 HARRY STAFFORD: You start getting better and better and
###301 better, and you just think, oh yeah, I can make it.
###303 You can go for the next step, you can just keep on going up.
###309 When you're riding, you should be happy all the time.
###312 If you're sad, then you don't do very well.
###317 MATHEW SCHOLTZ: For now I got like third,
###319 so I'm pretty happy.
###320 
###322 MATHEW SCHOLTZ: What happened?
###326 MATHEW SCHOLTZ: Really?
###328 
###338 JAKE GAGNE: I think I got sixth out of both qualifying,
###340 so six on the grid tomorrow.
###342 I'm not too sure about that second row, so I'm pretty
###344 happy with it.
###345 Just got to get a good start tomorrow.
###346 We'll see how it goes.
###348 STURLA FAGERHAUG: Yeah, and I'm going to beat him.
###349 At least try.
###351 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###360 ROY STAFFORD: We don't do holidays.
###362 We don't like doing holidays.
###364 This is our holiday, at the race circuit.
###367 I know it probably sounds sad, but it's true.
###371 What you have to remember is, racing is a very, very, very,
###375 small circle.
###377 There are not many people that race.
###381 We are all a family, because we all have a common interest.
###386 
###396 HAYDEN GILLIM: Our van that we have has a horrible AC system,
###401 so we drove yesterday back from here to the hotel with
###405 the side door open.
###406 MATHEW SCHOLTZ: We took 100 and what, like 60 kilometers?
###410 Hayden's hanging out, both feet
###412 outside, sliding and stuff.
###414 It was just crazy.
###416 And the end we saw pretty hot German chicks.
###421 HAYDEN GILLIM: We were lifting up our shirts and trying to
###423 see if they would do it.
###427 MATHEW SCHOLTZ: We were trying to flirt with them, but we
###430 weren't so good.
###431 
###437 HAYDEN GILLIM: In the rain, it's two things for me--
###440 either win or crash trying.
###446 So far, it's crashed.
###448 
###453 All right, now I'm pretty happy.
###455 If it stays like this for the rest of the day, this is going
###458 to be good.
###459 DANNY WALKER: They keep telling themselves that, I
###461 hate the rain, I don't like the rain, I hate the rain.
###463 And guess what?
###464 They're going to hate the rain, they're not going to
###465 like the rain.
###466 So Bradley's going to tell me that he loves the rain.
###470 Right Benny?
###471 I love the rain.
###472 No, can't even say it.
###473 Go on, say it.
###474 Didn't hurt, did it?
###476 Everything has to slow way down.
###478 Any of your actions that you have have a gigantic reaction.
###481 So if you brake really quick, or get on the gas really
###484 quick, or turn too hard, it usually ends up being a, I
###487 don't like the rain, I don't like it at all, doesn't it?
###491 BENNY SOLIS: I've been in the rain three times and every
###492 time I crashed, so we'll see.
###497 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###514 COLLEEN SCHOLTZ: Last year, Mathew did three races in the
###517 wix, and he did very well.
###521 And we put it down to his motocross experience, riding
###525 in the mud and everything in South Africa.
###528 
###540 HARRY STAFFORD: If you're aggressive with the bike, the
###543 bike can be aggressive back, and that's when you crash.
###546 It throws you off.
###548 It's like the bike's got an emotion, just
###550 the same as a person.
###553 It can only take so much, and then it snaps.
###557 [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REVVING]
###557 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###584 DANNY WALKER: We hadn't had a chance to ride the bike after
###586 it got crashed, and you just never can tell, you know,
###588 little things.
###589 We started it a couple times but without actually going out
###591 and doing a lap, you have no idea what's going to happen.
###594 So we had a slight problem, and we think we got it fixed,
###596 and he's ready to make up some points this weekend.
###601 It's Christmas time for Hayden.
###604 He likes the rain.
###605 
###608 PETER CLIFFORD: Not a wonderful start from
###609 Fagerhaug, but not too disastrous, he has made some
###612 disastrous starts.
###613 But into the first corner, I think it's Kornfeil who
###616 probably leads.
###617 Kent is there in about fourth place, the white helmet, he
###619 drifts a bit wide.
###621 
###623 Out of the picture already has gone Kornfeil.
###626 Fagerhaug and Brown go past Kristiansson.
###629 So Fagerhaug now takes it down to a 1.9 second advantage, and
###633 he's really got Kornfeil in his sights.
###637 And Fagerhaug goes down, Fagerhaug goes down and out.
###640 Well, it's an absolute disaster for the cup leader.
###644 And we're just saying that before the race that really
###647 Sturla had it all to lose.
###649 He went into this race with a handsome
###651 40 plus point advantage.
###653 High sided, out of the race, goes Fagerhaug.
###656 
###662 Fastest man on the track, though, is Hayden Gillim in
###666 sixth place.
###668 He's riding brilliantly in these tricky wet conditions.
###671 Hayden Gillim in the black helmet has passed the white
###673 helmet of Danny Kent, and Gillim now is right there in
###677 the battle for the last rostrum position.
###679 
###686 PETER CLIFFORD: There is Hayden Gillim, he's now on his
###688 own, though.
###690 Gillim on his own.
###692 So what has happened to Scholtz and Kristiansson, has
###695 he just ridden away from them?
###697 
###700 Ah, no it's Gillim who had the fall and he's on his own
###702 because he's just got himself back into action.
###705 DANNY WALKER: Ooh.
###706 Ooh.
###706 Ooh.
###707 That close.
###709 It's called racing, otherwise it'd be a parade.
###710 You'd just nod and wave.
###714 ROY STAFFORD: Hey, he's up to 11th.
###717 Yeah, he's riding OK, he's riding within himself, he's
###720 riding according to the conditions, not doing anything
###723 stupid, opting out.
###724 PETER CLIFFORD: It's Kent and Scholtz.
###725 Scholtz goes up the inside on the brakes
###729 into the tight section.
###731 Here comes Jakub Kornfeil around the last climbing left
###735 hander, out on to the start and finish to win his first
###739 Rookies Cup Race.
###740 And down goes Danny Kent, out of the last corner, down goes
###744 Danny Kent.
###744 And it's Scholtz that takes second place.
###747 And across the line comes Jake Gagne.
###749 He didn't expect that, I'm sure.
###751 [BAND PLAYING]
###777 JAKE GAGNE: Everybody kept going down, and going down, it
###779 was really slippery.
###779 So I just sat back and let everybody else scratch,
###782 because I already was too far back at the beginning, so I
###784 just let everybody go down and ended up third.
###786 So it's good.
###788 
###798 COLLEEN SCHOLTZ: I am proud of Mathew.
###800 He started eighth on the grid and worked his way up to
###803 second, and I'm very pleased for him.
###807 COLLEEN SCHOLTZ: Nerve wracking.
###807 [LAUGHS].
###809 Especially as you can see him going, and you just keep
###812 thinking in your head, keep it smooth, you can
###813 do it, keep it smooth.
###815 
###818 
###840 ROY STAFFORD: Well, it was absolutely bang on.
###842 He started from 15th on the grid.
###844 Rode his own race, rode nice and steady, quite within
###847 himself, to the track conditions.
###850 And dash me, he come home ninth.
###852 So I'm well happy with that.
###854 
###881 HAYDEN GILLIM: These guys are idiots.
###884 HAYDEN GILLIM: I got a black eye.
###886 STURLA FAGERHAUG: I got some ice on my lower back, yeah.
###890 I landed straight on my back, so I'm feeling
###892 a bit of pain there.
###894 HAYDEN GILLIM: I landed on my head.
###895 
###898 HAYDEN GILLIM: Yeah, it is.
###900 GUSTL AUINGER: It was a race like
###903 professional racers are racing.
###905 And someone was very lucky today, and
###909 some were not so lucky.
###910 But I'm proud of my boys.
###912 They did a great, great job.
###915 ROY STAFFORD: Well, people often will say to you, how the
###919 hell can you let your child race around a circuit at 130
###923 mile an hour, putting them in danger.
###929 But what they don't realize is, these
###932 children want to do this.
###935 It is their life, their passion.
###938 And they are not forced at all.
###941 Not at all.
###942
