JEN AGG: Every once in a while,
people will be just


4
0:0:2,9 --> 0:0:4,65
like, I don't know why you put
Nutella on my foie gras.


5
0:0:4,65 --> 0:0:5,18
Like, they don't get it.


6
0:0:5,18 --> 0:0:5,87
They don't like it.


7
0:0:5,87 --> 0:0:7,78
But that's far more rare
than the people that


8
0:0:7,78 --> 0:0:8,74
are like, oh my god.


9
0:0:8,74 --> 0:0:10,62
I could eat 10 more of these.


10
0:0:10,62 --> 0:0:11,97
And that's definitely me.


11
0:0:11,97 --> 0:0:13,4
I love that dish.


12
0:0:13,4 --> 0:0:15,16
It's absolutely a big part of
the Hoof's identity, that


13
0:0:15,16 --> 0:0:17,32
young, really talented cooks
come in here and find their


14
0:0:17,32 --> 0:0:18,29
voice and become chefs.


15
0:0:18,29 --> 0:0:19,49
BRANDON OLSEN: I came
up with this dish.


16
0:0:19,49 --> 0:0:22,55
I wanted to do foie gras
and banana bread.


17
0:0:22,55 --> 0:0:24,8
And then I realized
that I like eating


18
0:0:24,8 --> 0:0:25,47
bananas with Nutella.


19
0:0:25,47 --> 0:0:27,5
I also really enjoy
pain perdu.


20
0:0:27,5 --> 0:0:29,86
So I made banana bread
into a pain perdu.


21
0:0:29,86 --> 0:0:31,3
And then I combined it all.


22
0:0:31,3 --> 0:0:33,53
JEN AGG: That's the genesis
and the story of the


23
0:0:33,53 --> 0:0:34,1
restaurant---


24
0:0:34,1 --> 0:0:36,69
really, I think , though,
is the cooks get to--


25
0:0:36,69 --> 0:0:38,7
there's so much experimentation.


26
0:0:38,7 --> 0:0:39,78
They're working with so many
interesting things.


27
0:0:39,78 --> 0:0:41,72
They have to have a really
strong voice to begin with.


28
0:0:41,72 --> 0:0:44,23
But I think every single person
who's come through this


29
0:0:44,23 --> 0:0:47,86
kitchen has only gotten better
from working here.

JEN AGG: Hi, my name's Jen.


33
0:1:2,9 --> 0:1:4,17
I'm owner of the Black Hoof
restaurant in Toronto, raw-bar


34
0:1:4,17 --> 0:1:5,3
and cocktail bar.


35
0:1:5,3 --> 0:1:6,59
What would you like know?


36
0:1:6,59 --> 0:1:8,82
One of the things that we are
most known for and almost


37
0:1:8,82 --> 0:1:11,5
every diner has --unless
they're coming in


38
0:1:11,5 --> 0:1:12,11
here all the time.


39
0:1:12,11 --> 0:1:13,19
They might skip it
occasionally-- is the


40
0:1:13,19 --> 0:1:14,31
charcuterie, the cured meets.


41
0:1:14,31 --> 0:1:16,16
We make everything in house.


42
0:1:16,16 --> 0:1:18,94
It's been something right from
the beginning, where--


43
0:1:18,94 --> 0:1:20,8
it says it, actually, on the
awning-- charcuterie.


44
0:1:20,8 --> 0:1:23,745
And that's the starting point
for what the Black Hoof is, is


45
0:1:23,745 --> 0:1:25,885
that we cure our own meats.


46
0:1:25,885 --> 0:1:27,36
BRANDON OLSEN: Small [INAUDIBLE]

48
0:1:28,36 --> 0:1:29,6
JEN AGG: Brandon is the chef.


49
0:1:29,6 --> 0:1:31,87
And he's really on top
of all of that stuff.


50
0:1:31,87 --> 0:1:34,82
And he knows how to read the
molds and how to understand


51
0:1:34,82 --> 0:1:35,55
when things are ready.


52
0:1:35,55 --> 0:1:36,97
Because you have to be
very careful with it.


53
0:1:36,97 --> 0:1:39,452
Is a very scientific approach.


54
0:1:39,452 --> 0:1:41,41
BRANDON OLSEN: One of my
favorite passions in life is


55
0:1:41,41 --> 0:1:42,7
to make cured meat.


56
0:1:42,7 --> 0:1:44,15
Here's our charcuterie board


57
0:1:44,15 --> 0:1:48,39
It's a combination of whole
mussels and salumis plus two


58
0:1:48,39 --> 0:1:49,22
cooked products--


59
0:1:49,22 --> 0:1:51,98
the mortadella and the
summer sausage.


60
0:1:51,98 --> 0:1:55,1
And it varies from day to day,
depending on what I have and


61
0:1:55,1 --> 0:1:56,54
what I want to use.


62
0:1:56,54 --> 0:1:58,5
Spicy horse heart salami.


63
0:1:58,5 --> 0:1:59,16
Summer sausage.


64
0:1:59,16 --> 0:2:0,14
Pork mortadella.


65

that I deal with.


68
0:2:5,11 --> 0:2:6,125
I have another farmer.


69
0:2:6,125 --> 0:2:7,23
That's beef.


70
0:2:7,23 --> 0:2:10,8
And then I also have a horse
farmer out in Quebec that I


71
0:2:10,8 --> 0:2:12,12
get my horse hearts.


72
0:2:12,12 --> 0:2:12,87
This is my favorite one.


73
0:2:12,87 --> 0:2:14,1
This is beef and spruce.


74
0:2:14,1 --> 0:2:16,0
It's like eating a
Christmas tree.


75
0:2:16,0 --> 0:2:18,27
In the spring time, we go
out into the forest.


76
0:2:18,27 --> 0:2:21,56
And we harvest the young spruce
tips, chop them up, and


77
0:2:21,56 --> 0:2:25,12
put them in a salumi farce
and dry it out.


78
0:2:25,12 --> 0:2:27,76
That's a charcuterie
board right there.

in the beginning.

0:2:42,1 --> 0:2:44,35
I really love that this
is how we do it.


87
0:2:44,35 --> 0:2:46,308
The smoked sweetbreads are
something we've had on the


88
0:2:46,308 --> 0:2:47,33
menu, again, for a
really long time.


89
0:2:47,33 --> 0:2:48,93
There are one of the
anchor dishes.


90
0:2:48,93 --> 0:2:50,13
Sweetbreads are the
thymus gland.


91
0:2:50,13 --> 0:2:51,25
So it's here.


92
0:2:51,25 --> 0:2:53,99
And it's around the heart
in baby cows.


93
0:2:53,99 --> 0:2:57,11
Smoked sweetbreads and tuna is
probably one of my favorite


94
0:2:57,11 --> 0:2:58,36
Hoof dishes, my favorite
Brandon dish.


95
0:2:58,36 --> 0:3:1,2
And you think about tuna crudo
and smoked sweetbreads.

0:3:1,2 --> 0:3:3,88
Most people are like, I don't
know if I want have that.

0:3:28,83 --> 0:3:29,9

0:3:34,46 --> 0:3:35,92
we just pick up where
we left off.

myself a feminist, apart from

0:3:37,47 --> 0:3:38,77
my previous womanizing
tendencies.


117
0:3:38,77 --> 0:3:42,322
Insofar as you definitely
inspired me to stay in the


118
0:3:42,322 --> 0:3:44,183
restaurant industry, despite the
fact that I thought it was


119
0:3:44,183 --> 0:3:46,7
a chauvinistic douche-bag
industry.


120
0:3:46,7 --> 0:3:47,1
And I mean that generally.


121
0:3:47,1 --> 0:3:48,84
JEN AGG: It is a chauvinistic,
douche-bag industry.


122
0:3:48,84 --> 0:3:49,563
IAN MCGRENAGHAN: No, exactly.


123
0:3:49,563 --> 0:3:50,686
But you showed me that it could
be something different


124
0:3:50,686 --> 0:3:52,7
than that, insofar as--
on a individual level.

so many female managers.

0:3:57,72 --> 0:3:58,88
Ian met us at the Hoof.


129
0:3:58,88 --> 0:4:1,71
And then Ian, Brandon, and I
all went to Grand Electric.


130
0:4:1,71 --> 0:4:5,2
It's this, like, taco
restaurant.


131
0:4:5,2 --> 0:4:6,54

they learned here and applied

them to a slightly different
model of doing things.


145
0:4:28,73 --> 0:4:29,34
And they've just--


146
0:4:29,34 --> 0:4:29,925
It's exploded.

avocado mayo, tostada shell.

little herb salad on top, a


154
0:4:47,58 --> 0:4:49,8
little bit of crispy shallots,
tweaked Mexicano.


155
0:4:49,8 --> 0:4:50,56
That looks pretty.

0:4:50,56 --> 0:4:51,76
That's squid from Goo.


157

ever in the city.

So we just replicate it
in a Mexican style.

doesn't fall over.

fry it, sauce it.
