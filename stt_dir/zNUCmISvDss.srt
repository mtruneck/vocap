MIKKEL RASMUSSEN: Hi, my
name is Mikkel Rasmussen


3
0:0:2,7 --> 0:0:6,2
and this is my partner,
Christian Madsbjerg.


4
0:0:6,2 --> 0:0:8,62
And tomorrow we are
launching a book


5
0:0:8,62 --> 0:0:10,414
called "The Moment of Clarity."


6
0:0:10,414 --> 0:0:11,58
It's a pretty exciting book.


7
0:0:11,58 --> 0:0:12,53
It's about people.


8
0:0:12,53 --> 0:0:14,3
It's about how to
understand people,


9
0:0:14,3 --> 0:0:17,12
how to understand
who we are as people,


10
0:0:17,12 --> 0:0:19,71
really understand your
customers-- not so much


11
0:0:19,71 --> 0:0:23,32
what they think they want,
but what they really want.


12
0:0:23,32 --> 0:0:25,64
But the book is also about
how you can sometimes


13
0:0:25,64 --> 0:0:29,28
get people dramatically
wrong, really misunderstand


14
0:0:29,28 --> 0:0:30,25
who we are.


15
0:0:30,25 --> 0:0:32,46
And it happens all the time.


16
0:0:32,46 --> 0:0:35,93
And I would like to start with
a little story about kitchens.


17
0:0:35,93 --> 0:0:38,68
And most of us cook.


18
0:0:38,68 --> 0:0:41,86
A couple of years ago
I went to a conference


19
0:0:41,86 --> 0:0:43,45
called Kitchens of the Future.


20
0:0:43,45 --> 0:0:44,89
It was a super
exciting conference


21
0:0:44,89 --> 0:0:47,58
where people are showing lots
of new technologies coming


22
0:0:47,58 --> 0:0:48,66
into the kitchen.


23
0:0:48,66 --> 0:0:50,74
And there was one
presenter from Ikea


24
0:0:50,74 --> 0:0:54,12
together with a couple of
Japanese technology companies.


25
0:0:54,12 --> 0:0:57,3
And they presented this
vision of a future kitchen,


26
0:0:57,3 --> 0:0:59,78
I think it's supposed
to be in 2040.


27
0:0:59,78 --> 0:1:3,9
And if you imagine you go
into this kitchen in 2040


28
0:1:3,9 --> 0:1:4,849
it's what's called
a smart kitchen.


29
0:1:4,849 --> 0:1:7,54
So it recognizes you, it
has face recognition, voice


30
0:1:7,54 --> 0:1:10,43
recognition, there's
laser beams guiding you


31
0:1:10,43 --> 0:1:11,81
to how to cut the fish.


32
0:1:11,81 --> 0:1:15,86
There's a fridge
with herbs in that's


33
0:1:15,86 --> 0:1:18,6
grown to your health
profile that's in the cloud.


34
0:1:18,6 --> 0:1:20,48
And if you look up in
one of the corners,


35
0:1:20,48 --> 0:1:23,42
there's a little thing called
a nanobot, which is basically


36
0:1:23,42 --> 0:1:26,12
a machine where you go and you
say, I would like a tiramisu,


37
0:1:26,12 --> 0:1:26,78
for example.


38
0:1:26,78 --> 0:1:28,56
And it basically,
out of nanomaterials,


39
0:1:28,56 --> 0:1:31,8
makes that cake for you.


40
0:1:31,8 --> 0:1:34,74
And I was completely
energized by this vision.


41
0:1:34,74 --> 0:1:36,11
I said, this is so great.


42
0:1:36,11 --> 0:1:39,11
There are still people
having big ideas.


43
0:1:39,11 --> 0:1:44,869
Until somebody
noticed that in 1956


44
0:1:44,869 --> 0:1:46,91
there was a couple of
people from General Motors,


45
0:1:46,91 --> 0:1:48,59
actually, doing
the same exercise.


46
0:1:48,59 --> 0:1:52,6
But they were thinking, how
will the future kitchen look?


47
0:1:52,6 --> 0:1:55,43
But seen from the
perspective of 1956.


48
0:1:55,43 --> 0:1:58,3
That means, how will the
kitchen look in 2006?


49
0:1:58,3 --> 0:2:0,12
So now we can evaluate, really.


50
0:2:0,12 --> 0:2:2,61
So I want to pay a
little film that they


51
0:2:2,61 --> 0:2:6,32
made about the kitchen
of the future in 1956.


52
0:2:6,32 --> 0:2:6,99
Can you play the movie?


53
0:2:6,99 --> 0:2:17,968



54
0:2:17,968 --> 0:2:32,17
[MUSIC PLAYING]


55
0:2:32,17 --> 0:2:34,78
-But this was a kitchen
like none I'd seen.


56
0:2:34,78 --> 0:2:37,53
Put a card in the slot
and onto the screen


57
0:2:37,53 --> 0:2:39,664
pops a picture of just
how your dish will


58
0:2:39,664 --> 0:2:42,842
look plus all the
ingredients you need to cook.


59
0:2:42,842 --> 0:2:47,56



60
0:2:47,56 --> 0:2:50,1
No need for the
bride to feel tragic.


61
0:2:50,1 --> 0:2:53,8
The rest is push-button magic.


62
0:2:53,8 --> 0:2:55,75
So whether you bake
or broil or stew,


63
0:2:55,75 --> 0:2:58,41
the Fridgidaire kitchen
does it all for you.


64
0:2:58,41 --> 0:3:1,51
Don't have to be chained
to the stove all day.


65
0:3:1,51 --> 0:3:4,178
Just set the timer and
you're on your way.


66
0:3:4,178 --> 0:3:8,66
[MUSIC PLAYING]


67
0:3:8,66 --> 0:3:13,64
Tick tock, tick tock, I'm free
to have fun around the clock.


68
0:3:13,64 --> 0:3:32,564
[MUSIC PLAYING]


69
0:3:32,564 --> 0:3:35,6
Jeepers, I'm exhausted.


70
0:3:35,6 --> 0:3:38,87
[RINGING]


71
0:3:38,87 --> 0:3:43,234
The kitchen of
tomorrow is calling me.


72
0:3:43,234 --> 0:3:45,575
My cake is ready.


73
0:3:45,575 --> 0:3:55,76
[MUSIC PLAYING]


74
0:3:55,76 --> 0:3:56,82
-Time for the show.


75
0:3:56,82 --> 0:3:59,345
Everybody on stage.


76
0:3:59,345 --> 0:4:1,47
MIKKEL RASMUSSEN: I think
what's really interesting


77
0:4:1,47 --> 0:4:6,49
to think about is if you look
at the core idea of the kitchen


78
0:4:6,49 --> 0:4:9,9
of tomorrow as Ikea
thought about it


79
0:4:9,9 --> 0:4:13,74
and this idea it's
exactly the same idea.


80
0:4:13,74 --> 0:4:17,97
And the idea is
cooking is slavery.


81
0:4:17,97 --> 0:4:20,36
Technology can free
us from making food.


82
0:4:20,36 --> 0:4:21,75
It can do it for us.


83
0:4:21,75 --> 0:4:23,41
It can recognize who we are.


84
0:4:23,41 --> 0:4:26,73
And simply, we don't have to
be tied to the kitchen all day,


85
0:4:26,73 --> 0:4:29,38
as they sing in this movie.


86
0:4:29,38 --> 0:4:33,46
And it's the same vision
you see again in 2006.


87
0:4:33,46 --> 0:4:35,55
When we imagine the
kitchen of the future


88
0:4:35,55 --> 0:4:37,65
it's still a kitchen
that's automated.


89
0:4:37,65 --> 0:4:39,53
We don't have to think about it.


90
0:4:39,53 --> 0:4:41,85
And it has a lot
of technology that


91
0:4:41,85 --> 0:4:43,63
actually takes the
human condition out


92
0:4:43,63 --> 0:4:45,24
of the whole thing of cooking.


93
0:4:45,24 --> 0:4:47,75
Now if you're an
anthropologist--


94
0:4:47,75 --> 0:4:49,43
we work a lot with
anthropologists--


95
0:4:49,43 --> 0:4:52,11
they would tell you
that cooking is perhaps


96
0:4:52,11 --> 0:4:55,87
one of the most complicated
things you can think about when


97
0:4:55,87 --> 0:4:58,54
it comes to the human
condition or human behavior.


98
0:4:58,54 --> 0:5:0,92
That if you think about
your own cooking habits,


99
0:5:0,92 --> 0:5:4,37
that they probably come from
your childhood, the nation


100
0:5:4,37 --> 0:5:5,87
you're from, the
region you're from.


101
0:5:5,87 --> 0:5:7,69
It takes a lot of skill to cook.


102
0:5:7,69 --> 0:5:8,46
It's not so easy.


103
0:5:8,46 --> 0:5:10,21
And actually, it's
quite fun to cook.


104
0:5:10,21 --> 0:5:11,71
There's also a lot
of improvisation.


105
0:5:11,71 --> 0:5:14,1
I don't know if you ever
tried to come home to a fridge


106
0:5:14,1 --> 0:5:16,0
and you just look into
the fridge-- oh there's


107
0:5:16,0 --> 0:5:18,13
a carrot and some milk
and some white wine


108
0:5:18,13 --> 0:5:19,57
and you figure it out.


109
0:5:19,57 --> 0:5:20,9
That is what cooking is like.


110
0:5:20,9 --> 0:5:23,51
It's a very human thing to do.


111
0:5:23,51 --> 0:5:26,91
And therefore, if you think
about it, having anything


112
0:5:26,91 --> 0:5:29,96
that automates this for you or
decides for you or improvises


113
0:5:29,96 --> 0:5:33,75
for you is actually
not doing anything


114
0:5:33,75 --> 0:5:37,98
to help you with what you want
to do, which it's nice to cook.


115
0:5:37,98 --> 0:5:40,33
And therefor if you
make technology,


116
0:5:40,33 --> 0:5:43,49
for example, that has
that core idea about who


117
0:5:43,49 --> 0:5:47,54
we are as people that cooking is
slavery and the idea is wrong,


118
0:5:47,54 --> 0:5:49,92
then your technology will fail.


119
0:5:49,92 --> 0:5:53,97
Not because of the technology,
but because it simply


120
0:5:53,97 --> 0:5:55,44
gets people wrong.


121
0:5:55,44 --> 0:5:57,12
And this happens all the time.


122
0:5:57,12 --> 0:6:1,8
And you cannot swing a cat
these days without hitting one


123
0:6:1,8 --> 0:6:4,41
of those refrigerator companies
that make smart fridges.


124
0:6:4,41 --> 0:6:5,4
I don't know you've
ever seen them,


125
0:6:5,4 --> 0:6:6,67
like the intelligent fridge.


126
0:6:6,67 --> 0:6:9,27
There's so many of them
that there is actually


127
0:6:9,27 --> 0:6:12,13
a website it's called fuck
your internet fridge-- I'm


128
0:6:12,13 --> 0:6:16,37
sorry-- and is a guy who
every month he tracks failed


129
0:6:16,37 --> 0:6:20,59
prototypes on
intelligent fridges.


130
0:6:20,59 --> 0:6:22,91
And here you have
April, 2011, May,


131
0:6:22,91 --> 0:6:24,77
2000-- you can actually
go in today and see


132
0:6:24,77 --> 0:6:26,99
are there any failed
internet fridges today?


133
0:6:26,99 --> 0:6:28,56
My guess is, there probably is.


134
0:6:28,56 --> 0:6:29,51
Why?


135
0:6:29,51 --> 0:6:33,9
Because basically, the idea
is wrong-- not the technology


136
0:6:33,9 --> 0:6:36,39
but the idea about who
we are, that we do not


137
0:6:36,39 --> 0:6:39,2
want the kitchen to
be automated for us.


138
0:6:39,2 --> 0:6:40,27
We want to cook.


139
0:6:40,27 --> 0:6:41,4
We want Japanese knives.


140
0:6:41,4 --> 0:6:43,42
We want complicated cooking.


141
0:6:43,42 --> 0:6:45,46
And so what we are
saying here is not


142
0:6:45,46 --> 0:6:47,45
that technology
is wrong as such.


143
0:6:47,45 --> 0:6:49,8
It's just you need to
base it, especially


144
0:6:49,8 --> 0:6:51,58
when you innovate
really big ideas,


145
0:6:51,58 --> 0:6:54,5
on something that's
a true human insight.


146
0:6:54,5 --> 0:6:58,84
And cooking as slavery is
not a true human insight


147
0:6:58,84 --> 0:7:2,38
and therefore the
prototypes will fail.


148
0:7:2,38 --> 0:7:5,9
There are many
interesting ways to think


149
0:7:5,9 --> 0:7:6,7
about technology and cooking.


150
0:7:6,7 --> 0:7:9,12
For example, molecular
cooking like this,


151
0:7:9,12 --> 0:7:11,4
where people experiment
and broaden what cooking


152
0:7:11,4 --> 0:7:13,7
is, and make it
more complicated,


153
0:7:13,7 --> 0:7:15,17
expands what we can
do with cooking,


154
0:7:15,17 --> 0:7:16,562
as opposed to automating.


155
0:7:16,562 --> 0:7:19,2
So we're not saying there's
something wrong with technology


156
0:7:19,2 --> 0:7:21,77
but we're saying,
sometimes it's a good thing


157
0:7:21,77 --> 0:7:24,73
to understand what your core
idea about the human behavior


158
0:7:24,73 --> 0:7:26,7
that you want to attack.


159
0:7:26,7 --> 0:7:28,82
Now, this is not
relevant all the time.


160
0:7:28,82 --> 0:7:31,68
This is only relevant
sometimes in a company.


161
0:7:31,68 --> 0:7:33,73
We have been working
with really big companies


162
0:7:33,73 --> 0:7:35,78
for over the last 20 years.


163
0:7:35,78 --> 0:7:38,12
And sometimes
there's a situation


164
0:7:38,12 --> 0:7:41,3
where things become
really uncertain.


165
0:7:41,3 --> 0:7:43,62
We talk about it in the
book as navigating in a fog.


166
0:7:43,62 --> 0:7:46,712
Here's an example-- this is
one of the biggest sports


167
0:7:46,712 --> 0:7:47,67
companies in the world.


168
0:7:47,67 --> 0:7:49,95
And I was attending
a workshop where


169
0:7:49,95 --> 0:7:51,35
we talked about the future.


170
0:7:51,35 --> 0:7:53,9
And they were presenting sport
shoes and tennis catchers


171
0:7:53,9 --> 0:7:55,407
and all kinds of technology.


172
0:7:55,407 --> 0:7:57,74
And all of a sudden, in the
midst of this big discussion


173
0:7:57,74 --> 0:8:3,27
about design, product
innovation, consumers, markets,


174
0:8:3,27 --> 0:8:5,78
there was a creative
director who


175
0:8:5,78 --> 0:8:8,79
raised a question that made
the room go completely quiet.


176
0:8:8,79 --> 0:8:13,46
And the question
was, is yoga a sport?


177
0:8:13,46 --> 0:8:16,39
And it's a really weird
question to ask yourself.


178
0:8:16,39 --> 0:8:17,67
But think about this company.


179
0:8:17,67 --> 0:8:19,68
This is a company--
one of the biggest


180
0:8:19,68 --> 0:8:21,48
sports producers in the world.


181
0:8:21,48 --> 0:8:24,56
And if you work there, you
are surrounded by sport.


182
0:8:24,56 --> 0:8:26,444
People are doing
sports all the time.


183
0:8:26,444 --> 0:8:29,11
They wear sport shoes, they play
sports, they talk about sports.


184
0:8:29,11 --> 0:8:33,61
Even their language has sports
metaphors built into it.


185
0:8:33,61 --> 0:8:36,659
And the core idea behind
that type of thinking


186
0:8:36,659 --> 0:8:40,83
is that sport is
really about winning.


187
0:8:40,83 --> 0:8:42,419
It's about athleticism.


188
0:8:42,419 --> 0:8:45,71
It's about winning in
the marathons and so on.


189
0:8:45,71 --> 0:8:49,159
And that's an idea that
this company has also when


190
0:8:49,159 --> 0:8:50,7
they discuss in a
workshop like this.


191
0:8:50,7 --> 0:8:52,6
I could clearly see it.


192
0:8:52,6 --> 0:8:53,82
So they would take
up a shoe and say,


193
0:8:53,82 --> 0:8:56,545
so what should the consumer
get out of the shoe?


194
0:8:56,545 --> 0:8:58,42
And they would talk
about that this shoe will


195
0:8:58,42 --> 0:9:2,19
make the consumer run a
marathon two minutes faster.


196
0:9:2,19 --> 0:9:3,82
And that's super great.


197
0:9:3,82 --> 0:9:7,44
I remember there was even
a swimming technology


198
0:9:7,44 --> 0:9:9,44
with some stripes
on that supposedly


199
0:9:9,44 --> 0:9:12,9
would make you do a crawl
a little bit faster.


200
0:9:12,9 --> 0:9:13,92
Things like that--
and it's great ideas


201
0:9:13,92 --> 0:9:15,87
if you want to win gold medals.


202
0:9:15,87 --> 0:9:17,59
But what this guy
was discovering,


203
0:9:17,59 --> 0:9:20,96
slowly it was dawning on
him and the [INAUDIBLE]


204
0:9:20,96 --> 0:9:24,69
is there's something big
we are not getting right.


205
0:9:24,69 --> 0:9:27,75
There's something-- I
can't put my words to it,


206
0:9:27,75 --> 0:9:30,73
but the best way he could say it
was to provoke these gentlemen


207
0:9:30,73 --> 0:9:32,95
and say, is yoga a sport.


208
0:9:32,95 --> 0:9:35,52
And what he was talking
about was not yoga.


209
0:9:35,52 --> 0:9:39,41
It was the whole
phenomenon around sport


210
0:9:39,41 --> 0:9:40,56
that he was questioning.


211
0:9:40,56 --> 0:9:43,94
He was seeing that there are now
more fitness centers than post


212
0:9:43,94 --> 0:9:45,92
offices in every
town in the world.


213
0:9:45,92 --> 0:9:49,27
He was seeing people
doing 24 hour bike races.


214
0:9:49,27 --> 0:9:51,78
He was seeing the marathon
times coming down,


215
0:9:51,78 --> 0:9:54,7
with one hour on average,
because everyone now


216
0:9:54,7 --> 0:9:55,2
does a marathon.


217
0:9:55,2 --> 0:9:59,26
And he was basically seeing that
sports was being democratized.


218
0:9:59,26 --> 0:10:2,6
And it's not only about
winning gold medals.


219
0:10:2,6 --> 0:10:4,11
It's also about
slimming yourself,


220
0:10:4,11 --> 0:10:6,57
feeling good about yourself,
and things like that.


221
0:10:6,57 --> 0:10:9,14
But he had no way to
say that to the company


222
0:10:9,14 --> 0:10:11,42
because he didn't really
know how to voice it.


223
0:10:11,42 --> 0:10:13,34
And it was such a
big problem for him


224
0:10:13,34 --> 0:10:14,7
that he really didn't
know how to do it.


225
0:10:14,7 --> 0:10:18,9
And then in this
situation-- that's


226
0:10:18,9 --> 0:10:19,91
the situation
where we would say,


227
0:10:19,91 --> 0:10:21,78
this is the most
important point where


228
0:10:21,78 --> 0:10:23,1
you need to get people right.


229
0:10:23,1 --> 0:10:25,265
If you get people
right on this question,


230
0:10:25,265 --> 0:10:27,39
you get people-- wrong,
sorry, about this question,


231
0:10:27,39 --> 0:10:29,677
you get them wrong
all the way through.


232
0:10:29,677 --> 0:10:32,26
So if you think about your own
business-- now we are in Google


233
0:10:32,26 --> 0:10:34,26
but you could think about
any other business--


234
0:10:34,26 --> 0:10:36,93
and you have problems that you
deal with in your everyday,


235
0:10:36,93 --> 0:10:39,39
we would say there are
three types of problems.


236
0:10:39,39 --> 0:10:41,41
Some of them require that
you get people right--


237
0:10:41,41 --> 0:10:43,63
you're really strong in
that-- and some of them


238
0:10:43,63 --> 0:10:45,99
require that you can
just use your intuition,


239
0:10:45,99 --> 0:10:48,43
especially if you're really
familiar with the problem.


240
0:10:48,43 --> 0:10:50,43
So if you look at the
three types of problems,


241
0:10:50,43 --> 0:10:52,365
we can start in the
bottom and say, there


242
0:10:52,365 --> 0:10:54,86
are problems where it's
not really so uncertain.


243
0:10:54,86 --> 0:10:55,8
We've tried it before.


244
0:10:55,8 --> 0:10:57,34
We are pretty predictable.


245
0:10:57,34 --> 0:10:58,2
And those are called knowns.


246
0:10:58,2 --> 0:11:1,16
You can basically put an
algorithm to those problems--


247
0:11:1,16 --> 0:11:3,54
things like, if we put
money from this channel


248
0:11:3,54 --> 0:11:6,22
to that channel we'll
sell this much more.


249
0:11:6,22 --> 0:11:7,74
And that's something
you can just


250
0:11:7,74 --> 0:11:11,47
use an MBA kind
of thinking to do.


251
0:11:11,47 --> 0:11:13,2
They're good tools
and good methods


252
0:11:13,2 --> 0:11:15,11
and you don't have to get
people so right, really.


253
0:11:15,11 --> 0:11:19,21
You can base your decisions
on assumptions about people.


254
0:11:19,21 --> 0:11:23,0
Then it becomes a little more
difficult, more unpredictable,


255
0:11:23,0 --> 0:11:26,0
and you go to what we
call hypotheticals.


256
0:11:26,0 --> 0:11:28,19
And those are you know
what the problem is


257
0:11:28,19 --> 0:11:31,82
but there are various ways that
you could solve the problem.


258
0:11:31,82 --> 0:11:36,74
For example, we are
putting more money into R&D


259
0:11:36,74 --> 0:11:38,71
but we're not selling more.


260
0:11:38,71 --> 0:11:39,565
Why is that?


261
0:11:39,565 --> 0:11:43,2
And there could be
various reasons for that.


262
0:11:43,2 --> 0:11:45,7
Also here there are some
good tools and methods


263
0:11:45,7 --> 0:11:48,3
that you can use from a
business school, for example,


264
0:11:48,3 --> 0:11:50,36
calculating your way
through it, figuring out


265
0:11:50,36 --> 0:11:53,1
how big are things and so on.


266
0:11:53,1 --> 0:11:55,15
And then we get to
the yoga question.


267
0:11:55,15 --> 0:11:56,2
Is yoga a sport?


268
0:11:56,2 --> 0:11:58,95
That's not a known and
it's not a hypothetical.


269
0:11:58,95 --> 0:12:1,61
It's what we call a
big unknown, that it's


270
0:12:1,61 --> 0:12:3,81
something big you're
uncertain about.


271
0:12:3,81 --> 0:12:5,89
And this is the point
when you don't even


272
0:12:5,89 --> 0:12:9,2
know what the answer is and
you've never solved it before.


273
0:12:9,2 --> 0:12:11,13
And in the case of
the sports company,


274
0:12:11,13 --> 0:12:12,69
this was the situation.


275
0:12:12,69 --> 0:12:14,48
That to deal with
this problem they just


276
0:12:14,48 --> 0:12:16,73
couldn't calculate their
way through the problem.


277
0:12:16,73 --> 0:12:22,1
They had to figure out well,
how is sports changing as such?


278
0:12:22,1 --> 0:12:24,62
When you're in this
situation there's something


279
0:12:24,62 --> 0:12:27,26
happen that we have seen in
a lot of businesses, which


280
0:12:27,26 --> 0:12:29,92
is that we have
assumptions about people


281
0:12:29,92 --> 0:12:32,89
that we're nearly born
with or we learn somehow


282
0:12:32,89 --> 0:12:35,59
and they're really
difficult to take off.


283
0:12:35,59 --> 0:12:38,1
And one of the biggest
assumptions about people


284
0:12:38,1 --> 0:12:42,3
is this-- sorry,
I'll just go on--


285
0:12:42,3 --> 0:12:47,96
that we can be understood
as the smallest substances,


286
0:12:47,96 --> 0:12:48,94
like atoms.


287
0:12:48,94 --> 0:12:50,81
So here's a physician
that once said,


288
0:12:50,81 --> 0:12:55,32
"Everything is made of atoms,
there's nothing living that you


289
0:12:55,32 --> 0:12:57,86
cannot understand from the
point of view that they are made


290
0:12:57,86 --> 0:13:0,91
of atoms according to
the laws of physics."


291
0:13:0,91 --> 0:13:3,496
And I just have to say, really?


292
0:13:3,496 --> 0:13:5,75
Are we sure about that?


293
0:13:5,75 --> 0:13:8,46
If you take your own company I
could provoke you a little bit


294
0:13:8,46 --> 0:13:11,68
and say, could you take
this quote and put bits in?


295
0:13:11,68 --> 0:13:13,21
Everything is made of bits.


296
0:13:13,21 --> 0:13:16,37
There's nothing living that
you cannot understand from


297
0:13:16,37 --> 0:13:19,39
the point of view of a
bit or a calculation.


298
0:13:19,39 --> 0:13:22,66
And there's nothing wrong with
thinking this way if you're


299
0:13:22,66 --> 0:13:25,59
familiar with what you're doing.


300
0:13:25,59 --> 0:13:29,3
It's by far the most efficient
way to think about people,


301
0:13:29,3 --> 0:13:30,96
that we are basically
atoms and you


302
0:13:30,96 --> 0:13:33,47
can reduce people to
the smallest substance


303
0:13:33,47 --> 0:13:35,38
and then understand
the totality from that.


304
0:13:35,38 --> 0:13:38,89
But when you're in a big
unknown this is toxic.


305
0:13:38,89 --> 0:13:42,5
Because what will happen is that
you get people completely wrong


306
0:13:42,5 --> 0:13:46,28
and then your ideas will
end up as smart fridges


307
0:13:46,28 --> 0:13:48,465
that nobody wants, nobody
buys, and nobody uses.


308
0:13:48,465 --> 0:13:51,5



309
0:13:51,5 --> 0:13:56,78
Now we have seen that there is
many assumptions about people.


310
0:13:56,78 --> 0:13:58,7
There are five I just
want to talk about


311
0:13:58,7 --> 0:13:59,7
and then I'm going
to hand it over


312
0:13:59,7 --> 0:14:1,491
to Christian who will
give you a little bit


313
0:14:1,491 --> 0:14:3,56
of a philosophical
background before this.


314
0:14:3,56 --> 0:14:5,11
And then we will
give you an idea


315
0:14:5,11 --> 0:14:7,119
of how to get out of this mess.


316
0:14:7,119 --> 0:14:8,41
But there are five assumptions.


317
0:14:8,41 --> 0:14:11,68
So think about when you
talk about users, consumers,


318
0:14:11,68 --> 0:14:13,91
customers, what are
you talking about?


319
0:14:13,91 --> 0:14:18,846
Very often there's an
idea that human beings


320
0:14:18,846 --> 0:14:20,74
are first and foremost
thinking beings.


321
0:14:20,74 --> 0:14:23,572
That means you can understand
people by scanning their brain.


322
0:14:23,572 --> 0:14:25,78
That's one very, very common
assumption about people,


323
0:14:25,78 --> 0:14:29,6
that everything there is to
know about you is in your brain.


324
0:14:29,6 --> 0:14:32,332
Another assumption is
you know what you want.


325
0:14:32,332 --> 0:14:33,65
You know your intentions.


326
0:14:33,65 --> 0:14:35,7
That means you can go
and ask a consumer,


327
0:14:35,7 --> 0:14:38,2
so would you like
this in red or green?


328
0:14:38,2 --> 0:14:41,42
And they would actually know.


329
0:14:41,42 --> 0:14:44,33
A third assumption
is that consumers--


330
0:14:44,33 --> 0:14:46,97
they're all about
options and choices.


331
0:14:46,97 --> 0:14:49,77
So what you study is,
how do you make choices?


332
0:14:49,77 --> 0:14:51,52
So when you go out
down to the supermarket


333
0:14:51,52 --> 0:14:52,922
and you want to
buy a juice, do you


334
0:14:52,922 --> 0:14:54,296
want the juice
with the things in


335
0:14:54,296 --> 0:14:56,17
or the juice without
the little things in.


336
0:14:56,17 --> 0:14:57,878
And that's the very,
very important thing


337
0:14:57,878 --> 0:14:59,33
about consumers.


338
0:14:59,33 --> 0:15:3,95
The fourth thing that's
toxic is the assumption


339
0:15:3,95 --> 0:15:7,19
that your consumers, your
customers, your users


340
0:15:7,19 --> 0:15:9,8
actually know what they want.


341
0:15:9,8 --> 0:15:12,24
So you actually become
a slave to their needs.


342
0:15:12,24 --> 0:15:14,35
You just ask them,
what do you want?


343
0:15:14,35 --> 0:15:15,31
Oh, I want a red car.


344
0:15:15,31 --> 0:15:18,73
Hey, let's produce a red
car-- that kind of thinking.


345
0:15:18,73 --> 0:15:21,68
And the fifth one
is that people--


346
0:15:21,68 --> 0:15:24,24
because you can understand
them from their brain


347
0:15:24,24 --> 0:15:26,41
and have access to
their inner minds--


348
0:15:26,41 --> 0:15:28,7
that they are the
same, regardless which


349
0:15:28,7 --> 0:15:31,83
social situation
or mood they're in.


350
0:15:31,83 --> 0:15:33,525
These five assumptions--
you may think


351
0:15:33,525 --> 0:15:35,91
that this is pretty
banal or stupid


352
0:15:35,91 --> 0:15:38,76
or something like that--
but these assumptions


353
0:15:38,76 --> 0:15:42,58
are at the core of many,
many business decisions


354
0:15:42,58 --> 0:15:44,75
every single day that we make.


355
0:15:44,75 --> 0:15:49,21
When we ask people in a focus
group to evaluate a product,


356
0:15:49,21 --> 0:15:51,84
for example, it's based
on these assumptions.


357
0:15:51,84 --> 0:15:53,86
When we go and scan
people's brains


358
0:15:53,86 --> 0:15:56,61
to figure out whether they like
the red logo or the green logo,


359
0:15:56,61 --> 0:15:58,28
it's based on these assumptions.


360
0:15:58,28 --> 0:16:0,6
When we ask people,
can you just evaluate


361
0:16:0,6 --> 0:16:2,28
what you want on a survey?


362
0:16:2,28 --> 0:16:3,845
It's based on these assumptions.


363
0:16:3,845 --> 0:16:5,47
And I would even have
to say, sometimes


364
0:16:5,47 --> 0:16:7,6
when we do these
big data analyses,


365
0:16:7,6 --> 0:16:10,12
it's based on these
assumptions, that you


366
0:16:10,12 --> 0:16:13,14
can take people and pull
them down to what they need


367
0:16:13,14 --> 0:16:14,81
to put it together
to a bigger question


368
0:16:14,81 --> 0:16:17,1
and then here you have the
understanding of people.


369
0:16:17,1 --> 0:16:19,69



370
0:16:19,69 --> 0:16:22,37
Now this plays out in
many interesting places.


371
0:16:22,37 --> 0:16:24,7
And here's an example
of what can happen.


372
0:16:24,7 --> 0:16:27,33
So in many companies
what they do is


373
0:16:27,33 --> 0:16:30,67
they do these big surveys about
what people need and then they


374
0:16:30,67 --> 0:16:33,57
try to data analyze
their way through this.


375
0:16:33,57 --> 0:16:36,154
And they end up with
what's called segments.


376
0:16:36,154 --> 0:16:37,7
And here's an example.


377
0:16:37,7 --> 0:16:39,86
This is actually a
spirits producer.


378
0:16:39,86 --> 0:16:40,65
They get us drunk.


379
0:16:40,65 --> 0:16:42,6
That's what they do.


380
0:16:42,6 --> 0:16:44,22
And they looked at the
Asian market and women.


381
0:16:44,22 --> 0:16:46,5
And they did a
huge data analysis


382
0:16:46,5 --> 0:16:48,38
to figure out how many women
there are, how old are they,


383
0:16:48,38 --> 0:16:49,13
what do they need.


384
0:16:49,13 --> 0:16:51,49
They did surveys, focus
groups, everything,


385
0:16:51,49 --> 0:16:53,37
and boiled it down to
four types of people.


386
0:16:53,37 --> 0:16:55,44
I'm not going to go
through all of them.


387
0:16:55,44 --> 0:16:57,694
But one of them was called
the modern life seeker.


388
0:16:57,694 --> 0:16:59,61
And they figured out
those were the people who


389
0:16:59,61 --> 0:17:2,87
had the most money, who
loved to drink the most,


390
0:17:2,87 --> 0:17:6,73
and who we wanted to go for.


391
0:17:6,73 --> 0:17:8,78
And we were asked to go
out in the supermarket


392
0:17:8,78 --> 0:17:12,28
and help them identify these
people to study them further,


393
0:17:12,28 --> 0:17:13,8
get deep inside
into who they were.


394
0:17:13,8 --> 0:17:16,798
But we didn't
understand-- my mom,


395
0:17:16,798 --> 0:17:18,89
she's not a modern life seeker.


396
0:17:18,89 --> 0:17:18,589
I know that.


397
0:17:18,589 --> 0:17:19,7
And my sister is not.


398
0:17:19,7 --> 0:17:20,819
And my daughter is not.


399
0:17:20,819 --> 0:17:24,0
I just couldn't figure out,
what is a modern life seeker?


400
0:17:24,0 --> 0:17:26,9
And we went out to the
supermarket in Bangkok.


401
0:17:26,9 --> 0:17:28,88
And in this supermarket--
it's the biggest


402
0:17:28,88 --> 0:17:31,611
in the world-- it's the most
instagramed, sorry, shopping


403
0:17:31,611 --> 0:17:32,36
mall in the world.


404
0:17:32,36 --> 0:17:35,61
There are thick women and thin
women, clever, smart, dumb--


405
0:17:35,61 --> 0:17:37,57
there are all types of women.


406
0:17:37,57 --> 0:17:40,78
And we asked, could you point
out the modern life seeker?


407
0:17:40,78 --> 0:17:42,88
And they kind of started
sweating and said,


408
0:17:42,88 --> 0:17:45,7
she's not here.


409
0:17:45,7 --> 0:17:47,32
And you know why she's not here?


410
0:17:47,32 --> 0:17:49,63
Because she does not exist.


411
0:17:49,63 --> 0:17:51,7
Why does she not exist?


412
0:17:51,7 --> 0:17:55,76
Because it's based on wrong
assumptions on who we are.


413
0:17:55,76 --> 0:17:58,61
And it becomes a tool where
you as a company can say,


414
0:17:58,61 --> 0:18:1,19
oh our consumers are
out here in a nice model


415
0:18:1,19 --> 0:18:3,28
and we don't really
have to be part of that.


416
0:18:3,28 --> 0:18:6,34
We can just analyze them and
tell them what they want.


417
0:18:6,34 --> 0:18:9,307
And there are many other
examples of this going on.


418
0:18:9,307 --> 0:18:10,64
Maybe you should take over here.


419
0:18:10,64 --> 0:18:12,802



420
0:18:12,802 --> 0:18:14,26
CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG:
So what we see


421
0:18:14,26 --> 0:18:17,23
is the same research project
in many different ways.


422
0:18:17,23 --> 0:18:19,26
So the research
project is basically,


423
0:18:19,26 --> 0:18:22,18
as we try to write in the
book, a Cartesian-- a Rene


424
0:18:22,18 --> 0:18:24,77
Descartes-inspired project.


425
0:18:24,77 --> 0:18:27,41
Which is that we have
access to our inner states.


426
0:18:27,41 --> 0:18:30,23
We can see what
we want and need.


427
0:18:30,23 --> 0:18:32,9
And the mind is us.


428
0:18:32,9 --> 0:18:35,77
And the mind is the
brain-- so a set


429
0:18:35,77 --> 0:18:38,32
of reductions about who we are.


430
0:18:38,32 --> 0:18:41,649
And if we look at the
world it's different.


431
0:18:41,649 --> 0:18:43,44
And we'll show you a
little bit about that.


432
0:18:43,44 --> 0:18:46,34
But there's a couple of baseline
things we see all the time.


433
0:18:46,34 --> 0:18:49,73
The first one is that you can
get it down to algorithms.


434
0:18:49,73 --> 0:18:55,53
You can create systems
for understanding the data


435
0:18:55,53 --> 0:18:57,35
that people generate
in their activity.


436
0:18:57,35 --> 0:19:1,4
And if you take me-- where
I work, what I click on,


437
0:19:1,4 --> 0:19:4,67
where I'm with my phone, where
I drive, and so on-- that's me.


438
0:19:4,67 --> 0:19:6,16
That's a very good
picture of who


439
0:19:6,16 --> 0:19:8,51
I am and the kinds
of decisions I make.


440
0:19:8,51 --> 0:19:10,17
The second one is
atomized, that you


441
0:19:10,17 --> 0:19:13,75
can think of people as
self-contained entities,


442
0:19:13,75 --> 0:19:18,49
that we are basically
individual subjects that


443
0:19:18,49 --> 0:19:20,22
stand against objects
and give meaning


444
0:19:20,22 --> 0:19:22,8
to the world in that way.


445
0:19:22,8 --> 0:19:24,22
And the last thing is
that we're rational.


446
0:19:24,22 --> 0:19:28,46
Everybody knows that we're
not rational all the time.


447
0:19:28,46 --> 0:19:31,221
But it's something-- and
there's been economists


448
0:19:31,221 --> 0:19:33,47
that go a little further and
say that irrational might


449
0:19:33,47 --> 0:19:35,13
be a category we
could use as well.


450
0:19:35,13 --> 0:19:38,58
But basically, it's the
rational irrational model.


451
0:19:38,58 --> 0:19:40,3
And we think that's wrong.


452
0:19:40,3 --> 0:19:43,93
And I'll show you a picture here
to explain what it is we mean.


453
0:19:43,93 --> 0:19:48,77
This is a picture from a project
by a guy called Paul Radcliff.


454
0:19:48,77 --> 0:19:51,79
And he asked people to take
pictures of the best moment


455
0:19:51,79 --> 0:19:55,18
in a week, the time in
the week that was best.


456
0:19:55,18 --> 0:19:59,259
And it's this lady-- she
sends a picture of umbrellas.


457
0:19:59,259 --> 0:20:0,8
And I think you know
this kind of day


458
0:20:0,8 --> 0:20:5,164
in New York City where
it's soaking wet.


459
0:20:5,164 --> 0:20:7,75
And she lost her
crappy umbrella.


460
0:20:7,75 --> 0:20:9,63
Her umbrella was
destroyed by wind.


461
0:20:9,63 --> 0:20:11,404
And she tried to trash it.


462
0:20:11,404 --> 0:20:12,82
And when she tried
to trash it she


463
0:20:12,82 --> 0:20:15,6
saw that that happened
to others as well.


464
0:20:15,6 --> 0:20:20,29
Which meant that the most
absurdly annoying situation


465
0:20:20,29 --> 0:20:24,15
of getting completely soaked
and losing your umbrella


466
0:20:24,15 --> 0:20:26,58
became delightful
because it was funny.


467
0:20:26,58 --> 0:20:29,19
It's funny that other people
were in the same situation.


468
0:20:29,19 --> 0:20:32,72
And I think you can also imagine
what that situation is like


469
0:20:32,72 --> 0:20:34,42
because you've been there.


470
0:20:34,42 --> 0:20:36,62
So you're connected to
humanity in a bigger


471
0:20:36,62 --> 0:20:39,286
way than just
rational processes.


472
0:20:39,286 --> 0:20:40,91
You're connected to
humanity in the way


473
0:20:40,91 --> 0:20:43,44
that we understand each other.


474
0:20:43,44 --> 0:20:46,6
I was at an art
museum in Los Angeles


475
0:20:46,6 --> 0:20:48,29
not long ago when
I met this guy that


476
0:20:48,29 --> 0:20:51,12
was sitting on a bench crying.


477
0:20:51,12 --> 0:20:58,326
And he looked at a big Syrian
tapestry from the 1600.


478
0:20:58,326 --> 0:20:59,95
And I asked him, so
why are you crying?


479
0:20:59,95 --> 0:21:2,74
And he said, because I
don't feel lonely anymore.


480
0:21:2,74 --> 0:21:6,9
I feel that somebody, in a place
I don't know, 400 years ago,


481
0:21:6,9 --> 0:21:8,72
felt exactly the same as me.


482
0:21:8,72 --> 0:21:11,36
So the picture was
about paradise.


483
0:21:11,36 --> 0:21:12,93
And he'd just lost his mother.


484
0:21:12,93 --> 0:21:14,78
And he was thinking,
where is she?


485
0:21:14,78 --> 0:21:16,24
What's going to happen to her?


486
0:21:16,24 --> 0:21:18,59
And somebody in a place
completely distant,


487
0:21:18,59 --> 0:21:21,806
400 years ago, had the
exact same feelings as him.


488
0:21:21,806 --> 0:21:23,43
So he felt connected
to humanity and he


489
0:21:23,43 --> 0:21:25,12
didn't feel atomized anymore.


490
0:21:25,12 --> 0:21:27,95
He felt connected to something.


491
0:21:27,95 --> 0:21:31,79
And that's a fairly deep
insight, if you think about it.


492
0:21:31,79 --> 0:21:36,5
It is that we are, first and
foremost, not thinking things.


493
0:21:36,5 --> 0:21:37,53
We're social things.


494
0:21:37,53 --> 0:21:41,42
We're geared into worlds, and
if you strip us of our world,


495
0:21:41,42 --> 0:21:43,12
we make no sense at all.


496
0:21:43,12 --> 0:21:44,79
We're not interesting at all.


497
0:21:44,79 --> 0:21:48,62
It is how we are in the
world that is meaningful.


498
0:21:48,62 --> 0:21:51,19
And we navigate our world
through familiarity.


499
0:21:51,19 --> 0:21:54,84
You know this, I
guess, when you go


500
0:21:54,84 --> 0:21:56,6
to a city you've
never been to before.


501
0:21:56,6 --> 0:21:57,95
Everything looks new.


502
0:21:57,95 --> 0:21:59,862
Right now the street
you go down looks


503
0:21:59,862 --> 0:22:2,32
like the street to the baker
or to the cleaner or something


504
0:22:2,32 --> 0:22:5,1
like that, because you're so
familiar with your own city.


505
0:22:5,1 --> 0:22:9,0
But when you move to someplace--
I moved to New York City


506
0:22:9,0 --> 0:22:10,95
from Denmark five years ago.


507
0:22:10,95 --> 0:22:15,19
And it's only now I understand
how extremely Danish I am.


508
0:22:15,19 --> 0:22:17,734
When I lived in Denmark
I didn't see it at all.


509
0:22:17,734 --> 0:22:19,15
It wasn't at the
forefront for me.


510
0:22:19,15 --> 0:22:20,165
I couldn't see it.


511
0:22:20,165 --> 0:22:22,29
In the same way, when you
stand in line for coffee,


512
0:22:22,29 --> 0:22:24,46
it's only when somebody
breaks the rules


513
0:22:24,46 --> 0:22:27,73
of standing in line that you
understand that there are rules


514
0:22:27,73 --> 0:22:29,65
for standing in line, right?


515
0:22:29,65 --> 0:22:31,36
So our familiarity
with the world


516
0:22:31,36 --> 0:22:33,39
is how we find our way around.


517
0:22:33,39 --> 0:22:37,6
And that whole layer
is not in the data


518
0:22:37,6 --> 0:22:41,65
normally-- the understanding
of how we act upon the world


519
0:22:41,65 --> 0:22:43,52
and how we make sense of it.


520
0:22:43,52 --> 0:22:44,51
In the philosophical
tradition they


521
0:22:44,51 --> 0:22:47,65
call that understanding,
as opposed to knowledge.


522
0:22:47,65 --> 0:22:49,99
Knowledge is data
in the way that you


523
0:22:49,99 --> 0:22:51,73
have a fair bit of data.


524
0:22:51,73 --> 0:22:55,66
But understanding is
how you interpret that.


525
0:22:55,66 --> 0:22:57,3
In the philosophical
tradition there's


526
0:22:57,3 --> 0:22:59,6
also been the
debate about how do


527
0:22:59,6 --> 0:23:1,3
you make sense of lots of data.


528
0:23:1,3 --> 0:23:4,2
And Francis Bacon,
400-ish years ago,


529
0:23:4,2 --> 0:23:8,4
said that the conclusions will
fall out of the data itself.


530
0:23:8,4 --> 0:23:11,56
If you look to the
big data people,


531
0:23:11,56 --> 0:23:14,739
they will often say that we
don't need theory anymore.


532
0:23:14,739 --> 0:23:16,28
We don't need
interpretation anymore.


533
0:23:16,28 --> 0:23:18,535
Because we have so
much data now that it


534
0:23:18,535 --> 0:23:20,786
will conclude by itself, OK?


535
0:23:20,786 --> 0:23:23,33
If this is true,
you can't do that.


536
0:23:23,33 --> 0:23:25,52
You do it based on something.


537
0:23:25,52 --> 0:23:28,16
And it's only when you don't
have familiarity with something


538
0:23:28,16 --> 0:23:32,89
that you need this kind of
analysis that we are proposing.


539
0:23:32,89 --> 0:23:37,8
We basically are in
the world already.


540
0:23:37,8 --> 0:23:39,2
We're always already
in the world,


541
0:23:39,2 --> 0:23:41,72
and we're always already
making sense of it


542
0:23:41,72 --> 0:23:43,6
before it even happens.


543
0:23:43,6 --> 0:23:47,11
So we know that's a chair
without taking our subjectivity


544
0:23:47,11 --> 0:23:50,35
and looking at the object
and then seeing what it is.


545
0:23:50,35 --> 0:23:51,55
We just know it's a chair.


546
0:23:51,55 --> 0:23:53,49
And we're very
familiar with chairs.


547
0:23:53,49 --> 0:23:55,47



548
0:23:55,47 --> 0:23:57,87
So what we say that there
are three building blocks


549
0:23:57,87 --> 0:24:1,376
you need in order to
be in situations where


550
0:24:1,376 --> 0:24:3,75
the business doesn't work,
where you're not making sense.


551
0:24:3,75 --> 0:24:9,82
So if you systematically launch
products that gain 1% to 2%


552
0:24:9,82 --> 0:24:13,8
market share, you might
want to think about it.


553
0:24:13,8 --> 0:24:15,35
So the first thing is
a humanized mindset.


554
0:24:15,35 --> 0:24:18,3
So, a mindset about
humanity that's


555
0:24:18,3 --> 0:24:19,97
different than the rational one.


556
0:24:19,97 --> 0:24:22,41
The second one is what
we call thick data, which


557
0:24:22,41 --> 0:24:25,492
is data about our
familiarity with the world.


558
0:24:25,492 --> 0:24:26,95
And the third thing
is what we call


559
0:24:26,95 --> 0:24:28,23
non-linear problem solving.


560
0:24:28,23 --> 0:24:30,51
And I'll give you a
couple of examples fast.


561
0:24:30,51 --> 0:24:32,92
The first one is we
say, the differences.


562
0:24:32,92 --> 0:24:34,88
There's a big difference
between properties


563
0:24:34,88 --> 0:24:37,9
about something and
aspects about something.


564
0:24:37,9 --> 0:24:42,869
The property of a woman
is that she's a woman.


565
0:24:42,869 --> 0:24:43,91
You can say it like that.


566
0:24:43,91 --> 0:24:44,66
It's biological.


567
0:24:44,66 --> 0:24:46,493
It's pretty clear that
you can analyze that.


568
0:24:46,493 --> 0:24:49,4
You can use natural science
methods to see that.


569
0:24:49,4 --> 0:24:54,17
The aspects about whether she's
feminine or not is an aspect.


570
0:24:54,17 --> 0:24:55,46
It's a human thing.


571
0:24:55,46 --> 0:24:57,8
It's layered into our
familiarity with the world.


572
0:24:57,8 --> 0:25:0,62
And what we are proposing
is that lots of people


573
0:25:0,62 --> 0:25:3,89
miss the aspects by only
focusing on the properties.


574
0:25:3,89 --> 0:25:6,3
And that's what you get
when you use natural science


575
0:25:6,3 --> 0:25:10,87
methods understanding humanity.


576
0:25:10,87 --> 0:25:15,15
Thick data is trying to analyze
what does something mean?


577
0:25:15,15 --> 0:25:17,29
How are things layered
into our behavior?


578
0:25:17,29 --> 0:25:19,69
So for instance,
if you go to a bar,


579
0:25:19,69 --> 0:25:25,23
and you see an attractive person
winking to you at the bar,


580
0:25:25,23 --> 0:25:28,99
you would know within a second,
without even thinking about it,


581
0:25:28,99 --> 0:25:34,65
whether it's suggestive, ironic,
critical-- whatever kind of all


582
0:25:34,65 --> 0:25:38,7
the options a small movement
with the eye can be.


583
0:25:38,7 --> 0:25:41,17
Understanding that and the
understanding of how you easy


584
0:25:41,17 --> 0:25:44,285
gauge whether that wink is
suggestive or not-- means,


585
0:25:44,285 --> 0:25:48,97
let's leave together or not--
is important for your success


586
0:25:48,97 --> 0:25:50,41
at that situation.


587
0:25:50,41 --> 0:25:52,54
And it's something
you all know but it's


588
0:25:52,54 --> 0:25:55,14
hard to analyze unless
you get thick data.


589
0:25:55,14 --> 0:25:56,98
And the way we do
that is we import it


590
0:25:56,98 --> 0:25:58,93
from the human sciences.


591
0:25:58,93 --> 0:26:1,3
So that is sociology,
anthropology, and so on,


592
0:26:1,3 --> 0:26:3,3
that have methods
in order to do this.


593
0:26:3,3 --> 0:26:7,19
And it analyzes what's below
the threshold of awareness.


594
0:26:7,19 --> 0:26:10,74
Now Mikkel told you
before about sports.


595
0:26:10,74 --> 0:26:13,47
At the time, when we're
talking about this company that


596
0:26:13,47 --> 0:26:15,71
is in the sports
industry, they called


597
0:26:15,71 --> 0:26:18,62
fitness "sports preparation."


598
0:26:18,62 --> 0:26:20,91
If think about that for
a moment the reason why


599
0:26:20,91 --> 0:26:23,57
it's called sports
preparation is, of course,


600
0:26:23,57 --> 0:26:25,52
that you prepare yourself
to win gold medals.


601
0:26:25,52 --> 0:26:27,58
The only reason for
going to the gym


602
0:26:27,58 --> 0:26:29,59
or doing yoga or anything
like that could only


603
0:26:29,59 --> 0:26:32,2
be-- if you are in the mindset
that sports is about winning--


604
0:26:32,2 --> 0:26:34,64
is to prepare yourself
for something real,


605
0:26:34,64 --> 0:26:37,2
instead of just
going to the gym.


606
0:26:37,2 --> 0:26:39,72
And what we found when
we looked at these things


607
0:26:39,72 --> 0:26:42,12
was we found what
in this case we


608
0:26:42,12 --> 0:26:43,99
call it the little
black dress phenomenon.


609
0:26:43,99 --> 0:26:48,83
But it was basically a fitness
measurement tool for women


610
0:26:48,83 --> 0:26:54,61
that we found across
generations, across geography,


611
0:26:54,61 --> 0:26:59,11
which was a dress that was
a little bit too small.


612
0:26:59,11 --> 0:27:0,82
So it was an
ambition, and it was


613
0:27:0,82 --> 0:27:3,26
layered into-- the
whole reason they


614
0:27:3,26 --> 0:27:6,259
did what they did was
embodied in that dress.


615
0:27:6,259 --> 0:27:8,425
And that's the kind of data
that we call thick data.


616
0:27:8,425 --> 0:27:11,38



617
0:27:11,38 --> 0:27:13,86
It's not the kind of data I
guess you work with the most,


618
0:27:13,86 --> 0:27:16,45
and we're not saying that
that's in any way wrong,


619
0:27:16,45 --> 0:27:18,91
we're just saying this is
another type of data that


620
0:27:18,91 --> 0:27:21,85
can be very helpful if you don't
have familiarity with an area.


621
0:27:21,85 --> 0:27:24,36



622
0:27:24,36 --> 0:27:27,54
So what we call
default thinking,


623
0:27:27,54 --> 0:27:34,98
hypothesis-based inquiry,
answers what and how much,


624
0:27:34,98 --> 0:27:39,115
research on what is and has
been or is happening right now--


625
0:27:39,115 --> 0:27:41,24
and what we're saying is
that there's another type.


626
0:27:41,24 --> 0:27:43,54
And we call it sense
making in the book.


627
0:27:43,54 --> 0:27:45,87
It's an exploratory inquiry.


628
0:27:45,87 --> 0:27:48,8
You're not basing
yourself on-- you're not


629
0:27:48,8 --> 0:27:50,64
trying to test a hypothesis.


630
0:27:50,64 --> 0:27:53,65
You are trying to cast
a net and understand


631
0:27:53,65 --> 0:27:56,2
patterns of behavior.


632
0:27:56,2 --> 0:27:58,47
And in the bottom you
can see the difference


633
0:27:58,47 --> 0:28:0,37
between correctness and truth.


634
0:28:0,37 --> 0:28:2,95
This is a classic Martin
Heidegger distinction.


635
0:28:2,95 --> 0:28:5,2
It's that there's lots of
things that are correct


636
0:28:5,2 --> 0:28:6,99
but that isn't true.


637
0:28:6,99 --> 0:28:10,7
So for instance, if
I ask my daughter,


638
0:28:10,7 --> 0:28:14,63
could you please put
six plates on the table,


639
0:28:14,63 --> 0:28:16,63
she would go and put
six plates on the table.


640
0:28:16,63 --> 0:28:18,879
And I'll come in and
they're all in a stack.


641
0:28:18,879 --> 0:28:20,67
And I'll say, well
that's not what I meant.


642
0:28:20,67 --> 0:28:24,21
I meant around the table with
forks and knives and stuff.


643
0:28:24,21 --> 0:28:26,755
And she will say, well six.


644
0:28:26,755 --> 0:28:27,88
So it's completely correct.


645
0:28:27,88 --> 0:28:30,12
There are six
plates on the table.


646
0:28:30,12 --> 0:28:31,78
But that's not the
truth about how


647
0:28:31,78 --> 0:28:34,12
you eat together in a sense.


648
0:28:34,12 --> 0:28:35,79
And what we're
trying to get to say


649
0:28:35,79 --> 0:28:37,74
is that there is a
method for getting


650
0:28:37,74 --> 0:28:44,57
to that shared, common
humanity truth about us.


651
0:28:44,57 --> 0:28:45,14
You want to say something?


652
0:28:45,14 --> 0:28:47,32
MIKKEL RASMUSSEN: Yes.


653
0:28:47,32 --> 0:28:51,27
And I just want to show you how
one company works with this.


654
0:28:51,27 --> 0:28:53,7
It's a company that
many of you know well.


655
0:28:53,7 --> 0:28:54,29
It's Lego.


656
0:28:54,29 --> 0:28:57,74
And many years ago
they were in trouble


657
0:28:57,74 --> 0:28:59,77
because they were losing money.


658
0:28:59,77 --> 0:29:2,8
But also they were
expanding into territories


659
0:29:2,8 --> 0:29:4,81
that they didn't know so well.


660
0:29:4,81 --> 0:29:8,13
And somehow they
got people wrong.


661
0:29:8,13 --> 0:29:11,88
At that time, when
we met Lego, they


662
0:29:11,88 --> 0:29:14,16
had some pretty
strong assumptions


663
0:29:14,16 --> 0:29:16,24
about what's going
to happen to play.


664
0:29:16,24 --> 0:29:19,28
And one of them is, we're
to die because PlayStation


665
0:29:19,28 --> 0:29:20,84
is going to take it all.


666
0:29:20,84 --> 0:29:23,91
Another one was a phenomenon
called instant traction.


667
0:29:23,91 --> 0:29:25,4
Have you heard about this?


668
0:29:25,4 --> 0:29:29,31
The idea is that kids these
days-- they have no attention,


669
0:29:29,31 --> 0:29:31,24
you can't get them
to do anything.


670
0:29:31,24 --> 0:29:33,63
So when you go into
a toy store, the toy


671
0:29:33,63 --> 0:29:36,76
needs to be very noisy and
very easy to play with,


672
0:29:36,76 --> 0:29:39,97
because that's the only way
you can get their attention.


673
0:29:39,97 --> 0:29:42,41
They also had a
creativity idea which


674
0:29:42,41 --> 0:29:44,73
was called crisp, cool, wow.


675
0:29:44,73 --> 0:29:46,379
And that was, anything
was evaluated on


676
0:29:46,379 --> 0:29:47,92
is it crisp, is it
cool, or is what--


677
0:29:47,92 --> 0:29:50,45
nobody knew what it meant.


678
0:29:50,45 --> 0:29:51,98
Is it crisp, cool, or wow.


679
0:29:51,98 --> 0:29:54,96
So that means you
can just do anything.


680
0:29:54,96 --> 0:29:58,46
That boys wanted evil-- so you
can see when they did Bionicle


681
0:29:58,46 --> 0:30:2,46
that there's dark and
red and blood and death.


682
0:30:2,46 --> 0:30:4,99
And that girls
wanted pink-- and you


683
0:30:4,99 --> 0:30:8,62
can see that it's pink princess,
everything was pink, and so on.


684
0:30:8,62 --> 0:30:12,34
And basically they assumed
that because of this the brick


685
0:30:12,34 --> 0:30:13,97
has no future.


686
0:30:13,97 --> 0:30:16,28
We have to head in
another direction.


687
0:30:16,28 --> 0:30:20,1
And they did that by launching
a lot of new innovations


688
0:30:20,1 --> 0:30:23,1
that was beyond the
brick-- software


689
0:30:23,1 --> 0:30:26,81
and toothbrushes and violent
toys and all kinds of things.


690
0:30:26,81 --> 0:30:30,12
And it basically got
them into trouble.


691
0:30:30,12 --> 0:30:33,19
They got a new CEO
who at one point


692
0:30:33,19 --> 0:30:35,47
said, I think we
need to understand,


693
0:30:35,47 --> 0:30:39,74
before we take any
decisions, why do kids plays


694
0:30:39,74 --> 0:30:43,72
and what role do
we play in that?


695
0:30:43,72 --> 0:30:47,6
And the first step in getting
the human condition right,


696
0:30:47,6 --> 0:30:49,15
like Christian
was talking about,


697
0:30:49,15 --> 0:30:51,29
is not really doing
any research or meeting


698
0:30:51,29 --> 0:30:52,93
any consumers or
anything like that.


699
0:30:52,93 --> 0:30:54,71
It's looking at the
assumptions you have


700
0:30:54,71 --> 0:30:56,8
and trying to
change the question.


701
0:30:56,8 --> 0:31:0,657
We talk about this as framing
your problem as a phenomena.


702
0:31:0,657 --> 0:31:2,49
And that's a very
academic way of saying it.


703
0:31:2,49 --> 0:31:6,92
A simpler way is, try to ask
your business question in a way


704
0:31:6,92 --> 0:31:9,46
that a person can experience.


705
0:31:9,46 --> 0:31:13,24
So for example, the big business
question for Lego at that point


706
0:31:13,24 --> 0:31:15,32
was, how can we sell more toys?


707
0:31:15,32 --> 0:31:17,14
It's a very natural,
very good question.


708
0:31:17,14 --> 0:31:20,96
It's just that it's not
something anybody experiences.


709
0:31:20,96 --> 0:31:26,5
And what they did is change that
around to a question which was,


710
0:31:26,5 --> 0:31:27,67
why do kids play?


711
0:31:27,67 --> 0:31:30,74
It's a very simple little
trick but it does wonder.


712
0:31:30,74 --> 0:31:35,56
Because you start looking
at very different behaviors


713
0:31:35,56 --> 0:31:37,634
when you look at
why do kids play.


714
0:31:37,634 --> 0:31:39,8
It's actually a little
tricky, if you look at a kid,


715
0:31:39,8 --> 0:31:40,984
why do they play?


716
0:31:40,984 --> 0:31:42,4
Jesus, I don't
know why they play.


717
0:31:42,4 --> 0:31:43,58
They just do it.


718
0:31:43,58 --> 0:31:45,14
Yeah, but why do they play?


719
0:31:45,14 --> 0:31:51,13
And what Lego did was they spent
half a year going out to kids,


720
0:31:51,13 --> 0:31:54,34
living with kids, observing
kids, figuring out


721
0:31:54,34 --> 0:31:57,6
what's their world like,
figuring out parents, figuring


722
0:31:57,6 --> 0:32:0,9
out how school works,
and trying to go down


723
0:32:0,9 --> 0:32:4,69
to that thick data that
could reveal why do kids play


724
0:32:4,69 --> 0:32:9,87
and then try to make sense of
that to find their own future.


725
0:32:9,87 --> 0:32:13,8
Now this was a really
interesting experience


726
0:32:13,8 --> 0:32:14,98
and lots of interesting stories.


727
0:32:14,98 --> 0:32:17,1
Here's one of them.


728
0:32:17,1 --> 0:32:21,26
This is a shoe worn by a
boy in Germany, I believe.


729
0:32:21,26 --> 0:32:27,62
And the shoe is 1,000 times more
worth for him than a new shoe.


730
0:32:27,62 --> 0:32:29,43
And we asked him why.


731
0:32:29,43 --> 0:32:33,7
And he says, because it's
worn in the right places it


732
0:32:33,7 --> 0:32:35,38
shows that I can
do a kick flipper.


733
0:32:35,38 --> 0:32:38,43
This shoes is worn
in the right places


734
0:32:38,43 --> 0:32:40,35
because he has tried
a million times


735
0:32:40,35 --> 0:32:43,1
to do the trick on the
skateboard that makes him stand


736
0:32:43,1 --> 0:32:47,2
out in the hierarchy
among his friends.


737
0:32:47,2 --> 0:32:49,24
And if you look
at that, it really


738
0:32:49,24 --> 0:32:52,58
means that he does not
suffer from attention span


739
0:32:52,58 --> 0:32:55,51
or loss of mastery or
de-skilling or anything


740
0:32:55,51 --> 0:32:56,29
like that.


741
0:32:56,29 --> 0:32:59,35
This kid is deeply
into one thing


742
0:32:59,35 --> 0:33:2,69
and he does it everyday for
hours and hours and hours


743
0:33:2,69 --> 0:33:4,3
and hours.


744
0:33:4,3 --> 0:33:8,16
And what Lego found
was all the kids


745
0:33:8,16 --> 0:33:11,91
that they met had this
deep mastery of something.


746
0:33:11,91 --> 0:33:16,16
They met one little guy who
knew everything about sharks.


747
0:33:16,16 --> 0:33:18,13
So he was building
a shark in Lego


748
0:33:18,13 --> 0:33:21,844
and they asked him so what
shark is the one with 23 teeth?


749
0:33:21,844 --> 0:33:23,51
Because there's one
shark that has that.


750
0:33:23,51 --> 0:33:26,34
And he knew the whole
history of sharks.


751
0:33:26,34 --> 0:33:30,13



752
0:33:30,13 --> 0:33:32,64
Now they also found
another interesting thing,


753
0:33:32,64 --> 0:33:37,25
which was that a lot of kids,
when you play with them--


754
0:33:37,25 --> 0:33:42,81
not talk to them-- they reveal
a big world of inside knowledge


755
0:33:42,81 --> 0:33:44,93
that we don't know as adults.


756
0:33:44,93 --> 0:33:46,259
We call it under the radar.


757
0:33:46,259 --> 0:33:47,3
We don't know it's there.


758
0:33:47,3 --> 0:33:48,44
So here's an example.


759
0:33:48,44 --> 0:33:52,1
It's a German boy who Lego met.


760
0:33:52,1 --> 0:33:59,3
And his mum told them that this
boy was really bad at maths.


761
0:33:59,3 --> 0:34:3,91
He was not good at school,
probably had ADHD, and so on.


762
0:34:3,91 --> 0:34:6,1
And she was kind of
worried about him.


763
0:34:6,1 --> 0:34:10,129
And to show that, she
had given him a trumpet.


764
0:34:10,129 --> 0:34:11,92
Do you think he was
playing on the trumpet?


765
0:34:11,92 --> 0:34:12,429
Not really.


766
0:34:12,429 --> 0:34:14,35
But what he was doing
was he was doing


767
0:34:14,35 --> 0:34:16,1
something called
fantasy football.


768
0:34:16,1 --> 0:34:17,19
And we observed that.


769
0:34:17,19 --> 0:34:20,86
And he was sitting with
a big piece of paper.


770
0:34:20,86 --> 0:34:24,714
And then he was in like
soccer-- so he's going


771
0:34:24,714 --> 0:34:26,79
and Luftkicker was going--
and he was coming up


772
0:34:26,79 --> 0:34:29,909
with these imaginary football
teams, imaginary players.


773
0:34:29,909 --> 0:34:31,76
And then he would
make a statistic,


774
0:34:31,76 --> 0:34:35,32
after 90 minutes of playing
the game, about who won.


775
0:34:35,32 --> 0:34:39,63
But not only that, he would
also make probabilities of,


776
0:34:39,63 --> 0:34:43,38
if you put your money on
Luftkicker against Litana,


777
0:34:43,38 --> 0:34:45,56
it's probably a nine to one.


778
0:34:45,56 --> 0:34:48,509
So here's a kid where his
mom and probably his school


779
0:34:48,509 --> 0:34:51,1
and all the psychologists
in the world would say,


780
0:34:51,1 --> 0:34:53,9
he suffers from attention span.


781
0:34:53,9 --> 0:34:54,96
He's not good at math.


782
0:34:54,96 --> 0:34:56,86
We're worried about him.


783
0:34:56,86 --> 0:35:0,6
But what LEGO discovered
was that behind all that,


784
0:35:0,6 --> 0:35:4,14
there was a kid who had so much
talent and so much mastery.


785
0:35:4,14 --> 0:35:6,8
It's just nobody was seeing it.


786
0:35:6,8 --> 0:35:9,77



787
0:35:9,77 --> 0:35:14,31
They took this insight
and really thought about,


788
0:35:14,31 --> 0:35:16,19
what does it mean for us.


789
0:35:16,19 --> 0:35:19,46
And basically they
saw three big things.


790
0:35:19,46 --> 0:35:24,2
One was kids have mastery
and they strive for mastery.


791
0:35:24,2 --> 0:35:26,88
Anything that's difficult
and complex and deep


792
0:35:26,88 --> 0:35:27,95
is great for kids.


793
0:35:27,95 --> 0:35:29,94
The other thing--
this was the thing


794
0:35:29,94 --> 0:35:31,6
with the shoe and
the skateboard--


795
0:35:31,6 --> 0:35:36,1
is that a lot of kids these
days are looking for hierarchy.


796
0:35:36,1 --> 0:35:38,97
I'm meaning, if you
ask any kid, so who's


797
0:35:38,97 --> 0:35:40,5
best at maths in your class?


798
0:35:40,5 --> 0:35:42,82
She will say, oh that's Jim.


799
0:35:42,82 --> 0:35:44,5
And who's number 17?


800
0:35:44,5 --> 0:35:45,64
That's Jack.


801
0:35:45,64 --> 0:35:49,59
Ask any European kid,
so which Italian player


802
0:35:49,59 --> 0:35:51,25
scored the most goals
three years ago?


803
0:35:51,25 --> 0:35:52,79
They'd know.


804
0:35:52,79 --> 0:35:56,65
And so we found hierarchies
everywhere, everywhere.


805
0:35:56,65 --> 0:35:59,88
So mastery and hierarchy.


806
0:35:59,88 --> 0:36:3,16
And the last thing
was the sensation


807
0:36:3,16 --> 0:36:9,61
of building something big
and complex and challenging.


808
0:36:9,61 --> 0:36:11,2
If you looked at
those three things


809
0:36:11,2 --> 0:36:15,46
and just think about-- we're
moving into girls' toys,


810
0:36:15,46 --> 0:36:18,37
we're moving into toothbrushes,
violent toys, stories


811
0:36:18,37 --> 0:36:22,3
with a lot of storytelling,
and we're move ourselves away


812
0:36:22,3 --> 0:36:24,59
from the core experience
of building something,


813
0:36:24,59 --> 0:36:26,7
creating something.


814
0:36:26,7 --> 0:36:28,53
And you look at the three
things that kids really


815
0:36:28,53 --> 0:36:34,25
need, which is-- mastery,
hierarchy, and challenges.


816
0:36:34,25 --> 0:36:37,96
LEGO found, but maybe the
answer is just right here


817
0:36:37,96 --> 0:36:40,85
in front of us and
it's called a brick.


818
0:36:40,85 --> 0:36:43,25
Because a brick can
give you mastery.


819
0:36:43,25 --> 0:36:45,84
A brick can give you hierarchy
if you've built something


820
0:36:45,84 --> 0:36:47,38
and show other people.


821
0:36:47,38 --> 0:36:49,89
And a brick can give
you a challenge.


822
0:36:49,89 --> 0:36:53,37
And if there was a way we
could put that idea into all


823
0:36:53,37 --> 0:36:55,89
of the things we're
doing, all the innovations


824
0:36:55,89 --> 0:36:58,4
we're coming up with, all the
products we're coming up with,


825
0:36:58,4 --> 0:37:1,41
the way our shops look, the
way our digital tools are going


826
0:37:1,41 --> 0:37:6,7
to look-- and they took
that very idea of back


827
0:37:6,7 --> 0:37:10,44
to the brick and mastery,
hierarchy, and challenges


828
0:37:10,44 --> 0:37:13,64
and put it into
their core offerings.


829
0:37:13,64 --> 0:37:17,77
So they created tools where
kids could design their own LEGO


830
0:37:17,77 --> 0:37:19,2
and get it printed, basically.


831
0:37:19,2 --> 0:37:22,92
They created LEGO games that
gave you skill and hierarchy


832
0:37:22,92 --> 0:37:26,4
and they went into the digital
universe with a much bigger


833
0:37:26,4 --> 0:37:28,78
precision than
they could before.


834
0:37:28,78 --> 0:37:32,92
And if you ask the CEO,
he says today they're


835
0:37:32,92 --> 0:37:35,2
number two toy
company in the world.


836
0:37:35,2 --> 0:37:37,51
They're really profitable
and successful.


837
0:37:37,51 --> 0:37:39,46
And not only because
of that but also


838
0:37:39,46 --> 0:37:42,345
because of that-- if you
ask him, he would say,


839
0:37:42,345 --> 0:37:43,47
well there are two reasons.


840
0:37:43,47 --> 0:37:47,1
One is that we basically did
the hygiene on the company


841
0:37:47,1 --> 0:37:48,751
and we now have
cost control and we


842
0:37:48,751 --> 0:37:50,0
know where we're making money.


843
0:37:50,0 --> 0:37:51,541
And all that you
can learn in am MBA.


844
0:37:51,541 --> 0:37:53,29
So that was one thing.


845
0:37:53,29 --> 0:37:55,3
And the other thing
was that now we


846
0:37:55,3 --> 0:37:59,78
understand why kids
play-- hierarchy,


847
0:37:59,78 --> 0:38:1,81
mastery, and challenges.


848
0:38:1,81 --> 0:38:4,72
And we can put that
into everything we do.


849
0:38:4,72 --> 0:38:8,61
OK, so that's the story
about how to do that.


850
0:38:8,61 --> 0:38:12,84
And in this book we say there
is a generic method behind this


851
0:38:12,84 --> 0:38:15,73
that any company could
learn, any company can do,


852
0:38:15,73 --> 0:38:16,56
if you do it right.


853
0:38:16,56 --> 0:38:19,36
If you start by framing your
question as a phenomenon,


854
0:38:19,36 --> 0:38:21,5
then you dig into
how people really


855
0:38:21,5 --> 0:38:24,85
are, how they really live, and
get a thick understand of that.


856
0:38:24,85 --> 0:38:26,674
Then you find the
patterns in that and say,


857
0:38:26,674 --> 0:38:28,9
what are the
interesting patterns?


858
0:38:28,9 --> 0:38:30,53
Then you say, what are the
consequences for our business?


859
0:38:30,53 --> 0:38:32,45
And then you frame
that as an idea that


860
0:38:32,45 --> 0:38:34,7
can create impact
for your business.


861
0:38:34,7 --> 0:38:36,337
That's basically the
simple way of doing it.


862
0:38:36,337 --> 0:38:37,42
It's really simple to say.


863
0:38:37,42 --> 0:38:39,6
It's not so easy to do.


864
0:38:39,6 --> 0:38:43,68
But it is simple to say,
because I just did it.


865
0:38:43,68 --> 0:38:47,33
OK so really what
we are saying is,


866
0:38:47,33 --> 0:38:50,98
we think that in an age
of a lot of big data


867
0:38:50,98 --> 0:38:53,73
and a lot of rational
thinking, there


868
0:38:53,73 --> 0:38:57,8
is a need also for getting
a little bit of humanity


869
0:38:57,8 --> 0:38:59,1
into business again.


870
0:38:59,1 --> 0:39:2,6
And there is a science
of understanding people.


871
0:39:2,6 --> 0:39:4,66
It's called human science,
anthropology, social science,


872
0:39:4,66 --> 0:39:7,75
political science,
parts of economics,


873
0:39:7,75 --> 0:39:13,18
literature, linguistics--
that has 100 to 200 years'


874
0:39:13,18 --> 0:39:14,76
tradition of
understanding people.


875
0:39:14,76 --> 0:39:16,74
And all they're
really saying is,


876
0:39:16,74 --> 0:39:20,17
there is something about us
that's not on the surface,


877
0:39:20,17 --> 0:39:23,1
they can only be
discovered if we reveal it.


878
0:39:23,1 --> 0:39:26,15
And I think that one of the most
emotional moments of mine when


879
0:39:26,15 --> 0:39:28,59
I wrote this book was when
I was listening to a song--


880
0:39:28,59 --> 0:39:31,31
I write and listen to
songs at the same time--


881
0:39:31,31 --> 0:39:35,6
and there was a song
by Tom Waits which


882
0:39:35,6 --> 0:39:38,4
is called "San Diego
Serenade," and he


883
0:39:38,4 --> 0:39:43,92
sings about how he
never saw the morning


884
0:39:43,92 --> 0:39:45,65
until he stayed up all night.


885
0:39:45,65 --> 0:39:47,5
And I can remember
that from when


886
0:39:47,5 --> 0:39:49,62
I was a teenager, the first
time I went out to a party


887
0:39:49,62 --> 0:39:52,93
and came home and the bird were
singing, it was in the summer,


888
0:39:52,93 --> 0:39:55,35
and I could just
feel the sensation


889
0:39:55,35 --> 0:39:57,33
of what a morning really is.


890
0:39:57,33 --> 0:39:58,33
I never saw that before.


891
0:39:58,33 --> 0:39:59,788
And that's what
he's singing about.


892
0:39:59,788 --> 0:40:1,55
He sings about, I
never saw the sunshine


893
0:40:1,55 --> 0:40:3,7
until you turned out the light.


894
0:40:3,7 --> 0:40:6,31
He says, I never
saw my home town


895
0:40:6,31 --> 0:40:8,3
until I stayed away too long.


896
0:40:8,3 --> 0:40:11,2
And then he's saying,
I never heard a melody


897
0:40:11,2 --> 0:40:13,39
until I needed a song.


898
0:40:13,39 --> 0:40:15,5
And that's the
very simple message


899
0:40:15,5 --> 0:40:17,93
that we have for you
guys, that there is a way


900
0:40:17,93 --> 0:40:21,8
to get both the top layers
of our experience as humans


901
0:40:21,8 --> 0:40:23,63
but also get to
the deeper layers.


902
0:40:23,63 --> 0:40:26,1
And both are needed
in the future.


903
0:40:26,1 --> 0:40:27,166
Thanks a lot.


904
0:40:27,166 --> 0:40:36,84



905
0:40:36,84 --> 0:40:39,31
CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG:
What do you do now?


906
0:40:39,31 --> 0:40:39,98
Any questions?


907
0:40:39,98 --> 0:40:42,694



908
0:40:42,694 --> 0:40:43,86
AUDIENCE: I have a question.


909
0:40:43,86 --> 0:40:45,71
Hi, thanks for joining us.


910
0:40:45,71 --> 0:40:47,53
Can you talk a
little bit about how


911
0:40:47,53 --> 0:40:51,12
you identify the
right question to ask?


912
0:40:51,12 --> 0:40:54,23
So sort of the process
of getting to the why


913
0:40:54,23 --> 0:40:56,806
do kids play-- what's that like?


914
0:40:56,806 --> 0:40:59,18
CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG: See, this
is a really good question.


915
0:40:59,18 --> 0:41:2,56
And it's interesting because we
got that question a few times


916
0:41:2,56 --> 0:41:3,49
before.


917
0:41:3,49 --> 0:41:7,6
And the literature
doesn't reveal anything.


918
0:41:7,6 --> 0:41:10,506
So our main inspirations,
which are German philosophers


919
0:41:10,506 --> 0:41:12,13
basically-- so Martin
Heidegger-- later


920
0:41:12,13 --> 0:41:17,24
on French philosophers,
have no method to this.


921
0:41:17,24 --> 0:41:19,75
The way we do that is
we turn it into a verb.


922
0:41:19,75 --> 0:41:22,42
So we say, what's
the main, most banal,


923
0:41:22,42 --> 0:41:26,24
we call average, everyday
experience that people


924
0:41:26,24 --> 0:41:27,37
have here.


925
0:41:27,37 --> 0:41:32,85
And then say, what
might that be like?


926
0:41:32,85 --> 0:41:36,3
So we say, what's the average,
everyday practice that people


927
0:41:36,3 --> 0:41:40,835
have, and are there
interesting and juicy questions


928
0:41:40,835 --> 0:41:43,21
that once you think about it--
once you think about play,


929
0:41:43,21 --> 0:41:45,17
I mean, I know kids play.


930
0:41:45,17 --> 0:41:46,85
But I don't really know why.


931
0:41:46,85 --> 0:41:49,28
And if we don't know
why, how can we ever,


932
0:41:49,28 --> 0:41:54,28
ever produce toys that
are helpful in that case?


933
0:41:54,28 --> 0:41:57,8
Why do people work out?


934
0:41:57,8 --> 0:42:2,99
So it's so dumb and average,
everyday and intuitive


935
0:42:2,99 --> 0:42:6,709
that people, in the beginning,
feel, well what does mean?


936
0:42:6,709 --> 0:42:8,75
And the way that the
traditional talks about this


937
0:42:8,75 --> 0:42:10,195
is as a phenomenon.


938
0:42:10,195 --> 0:42:12,71
That's also why the
philosophy behind this


939
0:42:12,71 --> 0:42:14,14
is called phenomenology.


940
0:42:14,14 --> 0:42:17,69
So it's-- what's the human
phenomenon that we can all


941
0:42:17,69 --> 0:42:21,54
share and all experience and
that's so close to us that we


942
0:42:21,54 --> 0:42:22,23
never see it.


943
0:42:22,23 --> 0:42:24,88
It's like wearing glasses--
maybe not Google Glasses,


944
0:42:24,88 --> 0:42:32,41
but any old glasses-- that
you don't think much about.


945
0:42:32,41 --> 0:42:35,43
So like I said before,
when you go out


946
0:42:35,43 --> 0:42:38,87
to what is called a
mini kitchen-- which


947
0:42:38,87 --> 0:42:41,88
is a fairly large kitchen--
but if you go out there


948
0:42:41,88 --> 0:42:44,53
and there are many people
around the coffee machine,


949
0:42:44,53 --> 0:42:45,92
there would be a line.


950
0:42:45,92 --> 0:42:48,86
There's somebody that's
next to get coffee.


951
0:42:48,86 --> 0:42:52,26
But you only see that
once somebody breaks it.


952
0:42:52,26 --> 0:42:57,14
So other than that, it just
works as our everyday dealings


953
0:42:57,14 --> 0:42:58,48
in the world.


954
0:42:58,48 --> 0:43:0,75
And that's exactly what
we're interested in.


955
0:43:0,75 --> 0:43:3,7
So we're interested in the
things that are so everyday


956
0:43:3,7 --> 0:43:6,4
that we don't see them.


957
0:43:6,4 --> 0:43:12,48
And there's a German
filmmaker called


958
0:43:12,48 --> 0:43:17,566
Wim Wenders that made a movie
called, "Far away So Close."


959
0:43:17,566 --> 0:43:18,69
And that's the whole point.


960
0:43:18,69 --> 0:43:22,897
It's so close to us
that it's far away.


961
0:43:22,897 --> 0:43:24,98
And it's because we can't
think about those things


962
0:43:24,98 --> 0:43:25,55
all the time.


963
0:43:25,55 --> 0:43:27,425
You can't think about
how do I stand in line?


964
0:43:27,425 --> 0:43:28,95
You just do it.


965
0:43:28,95 --> 0:43:31,87
Or how do you drive a car--
if you move to New York City--


966
0:43:31,87 --> 0:43:32,67
I moved to New York
City and I'm still


967
0:43:32,67 --> 0:43:35,27
trying to figure out
how traffic works here.


968
0:43:35,27 --> 0:43:37,872
People speed up at the
wrong times and break at--


969
0:43:37,872 --> 0:43:39,8
and they get annoyed with me.


970
0:43:39,8 --> 0:43:42,35
I don't know why they
get annoyed with me.


971
0:43:42,35 --> 0:43:44,56
A space between two
cars is an opportunity


972
0:43:44,56 --> 0:43:48,145
to get ahead and get to the
red light as fast as possible.


973
0:43:48,145 --> 0:43:49,27
AUDIENCE: Just don't drive.


974
0:43:49,27 --> 0:43:50,478
CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG: Exactly.


975
0:43:50,478 --> 0:43:51,21
Exactly.


976
0:43:51,21 --> 0:43:53,2
So places have styles.


977
0:43:53,2 --> 0:43:54,81
And I guess, in a
couple of years,


978
0:43:54,81 --> 0:43:56,32
I might figure
out how it works .


979
0:43:56,32 --> 0:43:58,36
And I'll start get
annoyed with people


980
0:43:58,36 --> 0:43:59,64
when they break those laws.


981
0:43:59,64 --> 0:44:1,3
But I don't think
any of the people


982
0:44:1,3 --> 0:44:3,86
in the system would
ever think about,


983
0:44:3,86 --> 0:44:5,78
what's the style of
driving in New York City.


984
0:44:5,78 --> 0:44:7,82
It's just what happens, right?


985
0:44:7,82 --> 0:44:10,49
And that's exactly
the object of study.


986
0:44:10,49 --> 0:44:14,15
So we study familiarity, how
we are familiar with things.


987
0:44:14,15 --> 0:44:16,54
And familiarity withdrawals.


988
0:44:16,54 --> 0:44:19,23
In the sense, the classic
example is a hammer.


989
0:44:19,23 --> 0:44:21,8
Hammering-- the
last thing you want


990
0:44:21,8 --> 0:44:24,87
to do when you hammer
is think about it.


991
0:44:24,87 --> 0:44:28,97
You want to be-- you will
hit your hand and so on.


992
0:44:28,97 --> 0:44:31,84
And that is when hammers
are most hammers,


993
0:44:31,84 --> 0:44:34,94
is when they are engaged with
skillful people using it.


994
0:44:34,94 --> 0:44:36,59
That's when hammers
reveal themselves.


995
0:44:36,59 --> 0:44:38,43
You can also look at
the properties and say,


996
0:44:38,43 --> 0:44:41,321
it has a wooden shank and
a metal blob at the end


997
0:44:41,321 --> 0:44:41,82
and so on.


998
0:44:41,82 --> 0:44:44,25
You can decode it from a
natural science perspective,


999
0:44:44,25 --> 0:44:45,99
how much it weighs and so on.


1000
0:44:45,99 --> 0:44:49,98
But it doesn't weight anything,
except if it's too heavy.


1001
0:44:49,98 --> 0:44:52,85
It's just perfect
when you use it.


1002
0:44:52,85 --> 0:44:56,92
In that sense, the hammer
withdraws from our experience.


1003
0:44:56,92 --> 0:45:0,92
And hammering becomes the
experience, in a sense, right?


1004
0:45:0,92 --> 0:45:2,2
Does that answer the question?


1005
0:45:2,2 --> 0:45:3,5
OK, good.


1006
0:45:3,5 --> 0:45:4,496
So again, familiarity.


1007
0:45:4,496 --> 0:45:7,4
AUDIENCE: All right, so
a question from here.


1008
0:45:7,4 --> 0:45:10,3
So when I was
listening to your talk,


1009
0:45:10,3 --> 0:45:13,21
first with the example
of the kitchen and later


1010
0:45:13,21 --> 0:45:15,97
with the LEGO example, I
noticed that the examples


1011
0:45:15,97 --> 0:45:18,56
were all very male centric.


1012
0:45:18,56 --> 0:45:20,38
They were about soccer.


1013
0:45:20,38 --> 0:45:24,98
All the kids in
question were all boys.


1014
0:45:24,98 --> 0:45:28,26
So which made me think, when
you're doing this process


1015
0:45:28,26 --> 0:45:29,94
and you're asking
about the why, how


1016
0:45:29,94 --> 0:45:35,83
do you guard against
your implicit biases


1017
0:45:35,83 --> 0:45:39,34
finding only part of the answer.


1018
0:45:39,34 --> 0:45:42,58
CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG: So that's
a methodological question


1019
0:45:42,58 --> 0:45:44,34
that you can't get out of.


1020
0:45:44,34 --> 0:45:46,19
And it's called the
hermeneutic circle.


1021
0:45:46,19 --> 0:45:49,33
It's basically, in order
to understand something,


1022
0:45:49,33 --> 0:45:53,215
you need to use yourself
and your own experience.


1023
0:45:53,215 --> 0:45:56,36
A Shakespeare comedy
isn't funny unless you


1024
0:45:56,36 --> 0:45:58,19
use your own experience.


1025
0:45:58,19 --> 0:46:1,31
Because-- yeah well,
that's obvious.


1026
0:46:1,31 --> 0:46:4,7
So the way that
we try to do this


1027
0:46:4,7 --> 0:46:8,64
is to work with our
biases, be aware of them


1028
0:46:8,64 --> 0:46:11,3
and try to adjust for
them as much as you can,


1029
0:46:11,3 --> 0:46:14,1
but accepting that you
can never-- there is


1030
0:46:14,1 --> 0:46:16,93
no view from nowhere
when you study people.


1031
0:46:16,93 --> 0:46:19,22
When you study quarks and
atoms and bits and bytes


1032
0:46:19,22 --> 0:46:21,23
or something like that,
there is a view from nowhere.


1033
0:46:21,23 --> 0:46:23,271
And the natural sciences
is a pretty good example


1034
0:46:23,271 --> 0:46:24,95
and a very successful
example of that.


1035
0:46:24,95 --> 0:46:27,7
But for human
sciences, your insight,


1036
0:46:27,7 --> 0:46:30,76
the interpretation yourself,
so you have to work with it


1037
0:46:30,76 --> 0:46:34,11
and be honest, basically, about
your own biases and so on.


1038
0:46:34,11 --> 0:46:37,92
Now we just did a study
about women and drinking,


1039
0:46:37,92 --> 0:46:41,57
which are two very
exciting topics.


1040
0:46:41,57 --> 0:46:45,26
And we found that women
are starting going out,


1041
0:46:45,26 --> 0:46:47,6
in places like
Russia, China, Brazil,


1042
0:46:47,6 --> 0:46:51,54
where they never, ever went out
with their friends and so on.


1043
0:46:51,54 --> 0:46:53,75
And it turns out it
freaks out the men.


1044
0:46:53,75 --> 0:46:56,22
They sit at home and don't
know really what to do.


1045
0:46:56,22 --> 0:47:0,8
And a whole new
culture is starting,


1046
0:47:0,8 --> 0:47:2,98
especially in Asia
it's quite prevalent


1047
0:47:2,98 --> 0:47:5,93
and it's a whole new
market and so on.


1048
0:47:5,93 --> 0:47:8,46
So it's not just men we study.


1049
0:47:8,46 --> 0:47:11,19
I guess the examples were
biased in that direction.


1050
0:47:11,19 --> 0:47:13,49
But in that case, you
need to, again, work


1051
0:47:13,49 --> 0:47:15,9
with your own assumptions
and your own biases


1052
0:47:15,9 --> 0:47:17,74
as much as you can.


1053
0:47:17,74 --> 0:47:20,186
And there is no
view from nowhere.


1054
0:47:20,186 --> 0:47:21,12
[INAUDIBLE]


1055
0:47:21,12 --> 0:47:22,745
MIKKEL RASMUSSEN:
When Christian talked


1056
0:47:22,745 --> 0:47:25,59
he talked about three things
you need and one of the last one


1057
0:47:25,59 --> 0:47:28,37
was called non-linear
problem solving.


1058
0:47:28,37 --> 0:47:31,1
And it basically means exactly
what you are talking about now,


1059
0:47:31,1 --> 0:47:35,22
which is you cannot take your
own ideas out of the picture.


1060
0:47:35,22 --> 0:47:38,89
That means this type
of analysis will never


1061
0:47:38,89 --> 0:47:42,97
be a completely 100% percent
exact analysis of how it always


1062
0:47:42,97 --> 0:47:43,48
will be.


1063
0:47:43,48 --> 0:47:47,13
It will be a hunch about
how something works.


1064
0:47:47,13 --> 0:47:49,28
Like when you go
in and see a movie,


1065
0:47:49,28 --> 0:47:51,8
and you talk about
it afterwards,


1066
0:47:51,8 --> 0:47:53,67
you have an interpretation
of that movie.


1067
0:47:53,67 --> 0:47:56,4
But we are saying
is if a company can


1068
0:47:56,4 --> 0:48:0,6
have a conversation about the
customers they are serving


1069
0:48:0,6 --> 0:48:3,62
and start making interpretations
based on deep data,


1070
0:48:3,62 --> 0:48:6,96
it's much, much better
than having a numbers-based


1071
0:48:6,96 --> 0:48:10,25
and very thin data because
it gives them an insight.


1072
0:48:10,25 --> 0:48:12,0
But you have to place a bet.


1073
0:48:12,0 --> 0:48:14,34
It's not like a one-to-one
where you can say,


1074
0:48:14,34 --> 0:48:15,47
oh they all have red shoes.


1075
0:48:15,47 --> 0:48:16,48
Let's make red shoes.


1076
0:48:16,48 --> 0:48:17,59
It's not like that.


1077
0:48:17,59 --> 0:48:18,74
I hope that makes sense.


1078
0:48:18,74 --> 0:48:22,25
CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG: Yeah, and
you can say that there's-- you


1079
0:48:22,25 --> 0:48:24,13
can go to school.


1080
0:48:24,13 --> 0:48:27,9
And anthropology is
a tradition that's


1081
0:48:27,9 --> 0:48:31,25
100 years old which is
about understanding culture.


1082
0:48:31,25 --> 0:48:35,72
And just like you wouldn't ask
somebody that's not an engineer


1083
0:48:35,72 --> 0:48:37,98
to build a bridge, it
can be helpful to have


1084
0:48:37,98 --> 0:48:42,21
that kind of training if you
want to do cultural analysis.


1085
0:48:42,21 --> 0:48:45,59
But that doesn't give them--
anthropologists-- a view


1086
0:48:45,59 --> 0:48:50,286
from nowhere, either, in the
sense of natural sciences.


1087
0:48:50,286 --> 0:48:51,21
Oh, sorry.


1088
0:48:51,21 --> 0:48:52,9
AUDIENCE: Sorry.


1089
0:48:52,9 --> 0:48:53,18
When you guys are
working with leaders


1090
0:48:53,18 --> 0:48:55,704
who are so focused on the bottom
line, what's the persuasion


1091
0:48:55,704 --> 0:48:58,12
conversation like to say,
you're focused on this question,


1092
0:48:58,12 --> 0:49:0,98
but the actual one
is like, why play,


1093
0:49:0,98 --> 0:49:2,92
instead of how to
make more money?


1094
0:49:2,92 --> 0:49:5,72
CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG: So,
first of all, it works.


1095
0:49:5,72 --> 0:49:8,32
That tends to help.


1096
0:49:8,32 --> 0:49:11,74
But it feels
intellectual to them.


1097
0:49:11,74 --> 0:49:14,165
It feels non-familiar.


1098
0:49:14,165 --> 0:49:15,54
It doesn't feel
familiar to start


1099
0:49:15,54 --> 0:49:19,89
talking about lived experience
in this kind of complex way.


1100
0:49:19,89 --> 0:49:24,0
But if they're in enough
trouble, they tend to listen.


1101
0:49:24,0 --> 0:49:27,81
So a healthy crisis
is always a good sign.


1102
0:49:27,81 --> 0:49:31,0
And you can say that the LEGO
company had, at that point


1103
0:49:31,0 --> 0:49:34,78
that we're talking about here,
lost around $300,000 a day


1104
0:49:34,78 --> 0:49:36,4
for 10 years.


1105
0:49:36,4 --> 0:49:39,225
That makes people start
listening a little bit.


1106
0:49:39,225 --> 0:49:44,78
And it's a private company so
it's-- they were in trouble,


1107
0:49:44,78 --> 0:49:46,27
so that tends to help.


1108
0:49:46,27 --> 0:49:46,67
MIKKEL RASMUSSEN:
I also think we've


1109
0:49:46,67 --> 0:49:49,28
experienced, when we talk
especially to people pretty


1110
0:49:49,28 --> 0:49:51,81
high up, that there's a kind
of fatigue with the tools


1111
0:49:51,81 --> 0:49:52,9
they have available.


1112
0:49:52,9 --> 0:49:55,605
There's a fatigue with
the way strategy is done,


1113
0:49:55,605 --> 0:49:57,68
the over-quantification
of everything,


1114
0:49:57,68 --> 0:50:1,17
the million PowerPoint show,
how all the strategies end up


1115
0:50:1,17 --> 0:50:4,64
with the same idea that
we need to fight our core,


1116
0:50:4,64 --> 0:50:6,39
we need to go into
new areas, and we


1117
0:50:6,39 --> 0:50:7,619
need to build capabilities.


1118
0:50:7,619 --> 0:50:8,91
It's always those three things.


1119
0:50:8,91 --> 0:50:11,326
It doesn't matter whether it's
soap or [? tennis cases ?].


1120
0:50:11,326 --> 0:50:12,84
It's the same strategy.


1121
0:50:12,84 --> 0:50:15,66
And we can sense
that there's time


1122
0:50:15,66 --> 0:50:21,7
where those discussions-- and I
think many leaders are looking


1123
0:50:21,7 --> 0:50:23,48
for something new, something
that is deeper and more


1124
0:50:23,48 --> 0:50:25,34
inspirational,
basically, I think.


1125
0:50:25,34 --> 0:50:26,881
CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG:
And I would say,


1126
0:50:26,881 --> 0:50:30,11
I'm surprised by how complex
thinkers some of these leaders


1127
0:50:30,11 --> 0:50:31,89
are, actually.


1128
0:50:31,89 --> 0:50:33,18
Which is a nice thing.


1129
0:50:33,18 --> 0:50:36,274
That if you are at
that level, there's


1130
0:50:36,274 --> 0:50:37,69
a reason why you're
at that level.


1131
0:50:37,69 --> 0:50:42,0
And you have bandwidth enough
to deal with many things


1132
0:50:42,0 --> 0:50:44,29
at the same time.


1133
0:50:44,29 --> 0:50:45,79
So that's very
positive, in a sense.


1134
0:50:45,79 --> 0:50:47,13
Thank you.


1135
0:50:47,13 --> 0:50:47,71
MIKKEL RASMUSSEN:
You have a question.


1136
0:50:47,71 --> 0:50:49,876
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so my
question is around thick data.


1137
0:50:49,876 --> 0:50:55,74
And I think guys describe
qualitatively what


1138
0:50:55,74 --> 0:50:58,12
it was, I guess,
in your own style.


1139
0:50:58,12 --> 0:51:2,25
But before you had
this dichotomy of it's


1140
0:51:2,25 --> 0:51:5,15
not focus groups, it's
not explicit questions,


1141
0:51:5,15 --> 0:51:9,36
it's a little more tacit
or a little more subtle.


1142
0:51:9,36 --> 0:51:12,43
And I was wondering
how do you go


1143
0:51:12,43 --> 0:51:14,52
about collecting
that thick data?


1144
0:51:14,52 --> 0:51:15,99
Or what's that process like?


1145
0:51:15,99 --> 0:51:19,28
Because it seems more subtle
and a little more responsive


1146
0:51:19,28 --> 0:51:20,32
to the environment.


1147
0:51:20,32 --> 0:51:24,35
And for example, with the
playing with kids example,


1148
0:51:24,35 --> 0:51:28,42
it wasn't just observing
them or taking notes


1149
0:51:28,42 --> 0:51:31,14
but it was also the process
of actually playing with them


1150
0:51:31,14 --> 0:51:33,88
and maybe putting yourself
in their shoes a little bit.


1151
0:51:33,88 --> 0:51:35,87
So I was wondering if
you have any thoughts


1152
0:51:35,87 --> 0:51:38,34
about that methodology
on a larger scale.


1153
0:51:38,34 --> 0:51:40,7
CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG:
So anthropology


1154
0:51:40,7 --> 0:51:45,61
has developed a tools set called
ethnographic data gathering


1155
0:51:45,61 --> 0:51:48,27
from the 1920s and on.


1156
0:51:48,27 --> 0:51:51,2
And it's basically
largely misunderstood


1157
0:51:51,2 --> 0:51:52,18
in business today.


1158
0:51:52,18 --> 0:51:56,94
Because it means in-house,
in-context interviews.


1159
0:51:56,94 --> 0:51:58,53
So interview is
one thing and what


1160
0:51:58,53 --> 0:52:1,67
we say and so on is important,
but it's also important


1161
0:52:1,67 --> 0:52:2,54
what we do.


1162
0:52:2,54 --> 0:52:4,19
And so what we
normally is say is,


1163
0:52:4,19 --> 0:52:6,63
we're not interested
in people, really.


1164
0:52:6,63 --> 0:52:8,39
We're interested in worlds.


1165
0:52:8,39 --> 0:52:11,49
And a world has people
in it, for sure.


1166
0:52:11,49 --> 0:52:13,59
So let's say the
world of cooking,


1167
0:52:13,59 --> 0:52:17,6
or the world of business,
or the world of Google.


1168
0:52:17,6 --> 0:52:19,25
They're all-- or the art world.


1169
0:52:19,25 --> 0:52:22,385
They all have--
it's not a thing.


1170
0:52:22,385 --> 0:52:23,85
The art world is not a thing.


1171
0:52:23,85 --> 0:52:26,78
It consists of galleries
and artists and pencils


1172
0:52:26,78 --> 0:52:30,48
and paper and canvases
and all sorts of things.


1173
0:52:30,48 --> 0:52:33,25
And it has roles in there,
so people that feel they're


1174
0:52:33,25 --> 0:52:34,27
artists.


1175
0:52:34,27 --> 0:52:35,66
And it has identities.


1176
0:52:35,66 --> 0:52:36,9
And it has money.


1177
0:52:36,9 --> 0:52:38,5
It has all sorts of things.


1178
0:52:38,5 --> 0:52:41,46
In order to understand
a world, you


1179
0:52:41,46 --> 0:52:43,23
need a hook into that world.


1180
0:52:43,23 --> 0:52:45,37
And the way we do that
is through getting


1181
0:52:45,37 --> 0:52:48,58
people and seeing how
they deal with things


1182
0:52:48,58 --> 0:52:50,72
and how they do the
things that they do.


1183
0:52:50,72 --> 0:52:52,58
So it's not that
they can-- I mean,


1184
0:52:52,58 --> 0:52:54,24
they always lie to themselves.


1185
0:52:54,24 --> 0:52:56,84
We all like to ourselves
all the time about,


1186
0:52:56,84 --> 0:52:59,33
I need to cook for my
children all the time


1187
0:52:59,33 --> 0:53:0,98
and then I can't find
my pots and pans.


1188
0:53:0,98 --> 0:53:2,73
That sort of situation.


1189
0:53:2,73 --> 0:53:6,41
And we just try to cut
through that by saying,


1190
0:53:6,41 --> 0:53:10,38
individuals are less
interesting than worlds,


1191
0:53:10,38 --> 0:53:11,64
the worlds of people.


1192
0:53:11,64 --> 0:53:13,43
So what we study
is not individuals.


1193
0:53:13,43 --> 0:53:15,34
It's world.


1194
0:53:15,34 --> 0:53:17,152
So in a sense--
Margaret Thatcher


1195
0:53:17,152 --> 0:53:19,11
used to say, there is no
such thing as society,


1196
0:53:19,11 --> 0:53:19,78
only individuals.


1197
0:53:19,78 --> 0:53:20,946
We say the other way around.


1198
0:53:20,946 --> 0:53:24,13
We say there is no such thing
as individuals, only societies.


1199
0:53:24,13 --> 0:53:27,6
You are what you do and
the way you do it, but also


1200
0:53:27,6 --> 0:53:29,21
because of all these
other people that


1201
0:53:29,21 --> 0:53:30,35
deeply influence you.


1202
0:53:30,35 --> 0:53:33,201
And you might feel that you
have rational decisions on what


1203
0:53:33,201 --> 0:53:33,7
you do.


1204
0:53:33,7 --> 0:53:34,852
But you don't.


1205
0:53:34,852 --> 0:53:37,31
You make all sorts of decisions
because of your surrounding


1206
0:53:37,31 --> 0:53:40,552
and because the world you're in.


1207
0:53:40,552 --> 0:53:42,69
Heidegger calls it the one.


1208
0:53:42,69 --> 0:53:44,78
One does this and one does that.


1209
0:53:44,78 --> 0:53:46,44
That's most of the time.


1210
0:53:46,44 --> 0:53:48,216
We do things because
that's what one does.


1211
0:53:48,216 --> 0:53:49,34
One gets up in the morning.


1212
0:53:49,34 --> 0:53:51,37
One asks questions
when it's uncomfortable


1213
0:53:51,37 --> 0:53:54,29
that nobody's asked questions--
that sort of situation.


1214
0:53:54,29 --> 0:53:56,3
And that's exactly
what we study.


1215
0:53:56,3 --> 0:54:0,89
We study how people
live in worlds


1216
0:54:0,89 --> 0:54:3,66
and how those worlds interact
with them, in a sense.


1217
0:54:3,66 --> 0:54:7,425
So it's observational, but it's
with a theoretical framework


1218
0:54:7,425 --> 0:54:9,752
behind it, in a sense.


1219
0:54:9,752 --> 0:54:10,46
AUDIENCE: Thanks.


1220
0:54:10,46 --> 0:54:11,63
CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG: Did
I answer the question?


1221
0:54:11,63 --> 0:54:12,588
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thanks.


1222
0:54:12,588 --> 0:54:16,97
CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG:
Great, thanks Good?


1223
0:54:16,97 --> 0:54:18,75
Thank you.


1224
0:54:18,75 --> 0:56:18,75
