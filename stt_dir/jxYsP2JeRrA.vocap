###25 EDDIE HUANG: Let's go.
###27 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###44 EDDIE HUANG: Yo, we just landed in Miami, and the Miami
###47 episode is the last episode of "Fresh Off the
###49 Boat," season one.
###49 So savor it, enjoy it, marinate on that shit.
###52 And we're going to give you something extra heavy to chew
###54 on. 'Cause you're out in Miami, there's
###56 one person to see.
###58 You don't know who that person is, get the fuck out of town.
###60 Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too.
###62 
###70 All right.
###71 So we at Club Lexx with one of the soldiers watching the
###74 smokers here.
###75 Sosa, you already know.
###76 Show them the "Scarface" hat.
###77 Let me see what you're working with, man.
###79 SOSA: All right, we got a--
###81 EDDIE HUANG: Bang.
###81 Oh, St. Louis ribs.
###82 Look at that.
###84 Yo, you're definitely-- he's snapping for you right now.
###86 Look at this.
###88 Do you know what temperature you keep this at?
###90 SOSA: Sugar Ray, what temperature we
###91 keep this at, baby?
###92 SUGAR RAY: Like 350.
###94 EDDIE HUANG: 350?
###94 SUGAR RAY: Yeah, but you don't want no fire.
###96 You just want the pure smoke.
###97 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.
###99 So they barbecuing at a little bit of a
###100 higher temperature here.
###102 It's going to seal in the juices.
###104 It probably won't fall off the bone like you do when you have
###107 a lower temperature.
###108 That's mean.
###109 It's just a different style and technique
###111 of doing these ribs.
###113 Work.
###114 So what's in this?
###116 SUGAR RAY: Well, it's a mix of carrots, potatoes, onions,
###121 green peppers, Scotch bonnet peppers.
###125 EDDIE HUANG: OK.
###126 
###141 EDDIE HUANG: Wow.
###143 You know, every culture has a stew just like this, that was
###147 sustenance for hundreds and hundreds of years.
###150 And you could find tradition, you could find history, you
###152 could find culture, you could find sustenance anywhere--
###155 even outside of a strip club.
###156 Especially outside of a strip club.
###160 Chicken souse.
###162 UNCLE LUKE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
###163 EDDIE HUANG: What up, Luke?
###164 What's good?
###165 UNCLE LUKE: How you feeling, man?
###166 EDDIE HUANG: Chilling, chilling, man.
###167 Been waiting to eat these ribs.
###168 This shit looks good.
###169 UNCLE LUKE: You hit the right spot, man.
###170 EDDIE HUANG: Definitely.
###170 Thank you for putting us on, Miami.
###172 UNCLE LUKE: Did you order?
###172 Let's order.
###173 EDDIE HUANG: No, let's order.
###173 I'm gonna do it the way you do it.
###175 UNCLE LUKE: This is the world-famous chef right here.
###177 This is where you get real ribs, cooked to go.
###180 EDDIE HUANG: Yup.
###181 I want that "Banned in the USA" shit.
###183 UNCLE LUKE: Exactly.
###184 Exactly.
###185 EDDIE HUANG: Yup.
###185 UNCLE LUKE: The American way, baby.
###186 All right, hold on, Spike Lee, you getting this wrist action?
###188 
###198 EDDIE HUANG: So I want you to see, when you eat this
###200 chicken, when you eat barbecue chicken, you want to look for
###203 that red smoke color to it, right?
###205 That means it's smoked properly, when the chicken's
###207 got that redness to it.
###209 All right.
###211 Same with ribs.
###212 Ribs smoked probably will have a red ring to it.
###214 SOSA: We got slabs already seasoned, ready
###216 to go on the grill.
###218 Two hours, meat ready to go.
###222 EDDIE HUANG: They got this to a science.
###223 That shit is good.
###225 
###228 When they told us that we were doing the Miami episode, and
###230 they were like, who do you want to see on the show?
###232 I said, you cannot go to Miami and not see the Mayor.
###235 As a kid, you always, like, informed my life.
###238 Because first, you had to the half-Chinese
###239 dude in 2 Live Crew.
###241 UNCLE LUKE: Yeah, yeah.
###241 EDDIE HUANG: And I fuck with that, right?
###243 And then on the second level, I fuck with Miami.
###245 You were the Mayor.
###246 And free speech.
###247 You know, you put everybody on with the free speech.
###249 But then third, when I got older, in law school, it came
###252 back to Uncle Luke again with Acuff-Rose, 'cause he has the
###255 seminal case on the parity exception.
###258 Lawyers owe you one.
###259 UNCLE LUKE: Yeah.
###259 Yeah, yeah.
###259 EDDIE HUANG: Everybody in the music industry owe you on.
###262 So much respect, man.
###263 UNCLE LUKE: Hey, man, appreciate it.
###264 Appreciate it.
###264 EDDIE HUANG: You a legend, So we had to come see you.
###266 UNCLE LUKE: You know, yeah, yeah.
###267 I appreciate you coming down.
###270 Hey, you see the cars, the line of cars?
###271 That's for the barbecue.
###273 People go above and beyond to get this barbecue here.
###277 -Aw, man, I come way from West Palm Beach to do that, you
###279 know what I'm saying?
###280 Come over here and get some good souse, some good sauce.
###282 -I come way from Miramar.
###284 -I fuck-- hey, look here, friends go up, let's come down
###288 at the end of the day.
###289 -Oh, man.
###290 I don't know how much cocaine they got in the souse, man,
###292 but it's something to see.
###293 -Top notch, man.
###294 I come down here all the time.
###296 -That's, that's what I come here for.
###298 Damn them strippers, I came for the food.
###301 -Best in town, man.
###302 -Best in town.
###303 -That's what's up.
###305 UNCLE LUKE: I mean, they making so much money, they
###307 getting ready to open up their own
###309 restaurant right over there.
###310 They building it right now.
###312 Yeah, no, these guys came a long way.
###314 I remember when they first opened up over here.
###317 EDDIE HUANG: How long ago?
###318 UNCLE LUKE: What is it?
###318 SUGAR RAY: Six and a half years.
###319 UNCLE LUKE: Yep.
###320 EDDIE HUANG: Wow, six and a half years, under this tent?
###322 UNCLE LUKE: Yep.
###323 EDDIE HUANG: That makes me happy, though, 'cause a lot of
###325 times, the people that have these carts and the small
###327 businesses, they never get to take off.
###329 So that's great to see them prosper.
###332 UNCLE LUKE: Freaky Red in there?
###332 -Yes, sir.
###333 UNCLE LUKE: OK.
###333 Tell her her Daddy out here.
###334 [LAUGHTER]
###337 UNCLE LUKE: Why you got your pants down and everything?
###339 
###343 -Hi, Mister!
###344 UNCLE LUKE: So you go kiss her [INAUDIBLE]
###346 and look at her pants down.
###347 EDDIE HUANG: And the pants is down.
###349 -I love him.
###350 I know his--
###352 [LAUGHTER]
###354 EDDIE HUANG: Turn up.
###356 -Uncle Luke, I know all about that penis over there.
###359 Big Daddy.
###360 [LAUGHTER]
###363 EDDIE HUANG: Shit.
###365 After barbecue, the other thing down South, you eating
###367 barbecue, you know you need some fish fry.
###369 UNCLE LUKE: Oh, yeah, yeah.
###370 You gotta get the conch.
###371 This guy here specialize in the conch.
###374 And people come from all over the place, miles around.
###378 He really opens up at 12 o'clock, midnight.
###381 EDDIE HUANG: Oh, he starts at midnight?
###382 UNCLE LUKE: Yeah, midnight.
###383 Yeah.
###383 EDDIE HUANG: Wow.
###384 So it really is that aphrodisiac food.
###386 UNCLE LUKE: Exactly.
###387 Conch Daddy!
###389 You do a lot of chopping tonight, Conch Daddy.
###391 
###395 EDDIE HUANG: Conch Daddy, thank you.
###396 UNCLE LUKE: Hey.
###397 Oh, baby.
###399 And then when you finish this, you can go get any woman,
###403 aphrodisiac, lay up all night.
###405 EDDIE HUANG: Look at this conch.
###406 I'm-a bite into it so you can see.
###407 Usually conch is rubbery like octopus.
###409 UNCLE LUKE: That's right.
###410 That's the key.
###411 EDDIE HUANG: It just goes like that.
###412 You hear that snap?
###414 UNCLE LUKE: That's when you know it's fresh.
###416 EDDIE HUANG: Crazy.
###417 I mean, I knew you would know what was up, but this is
###419 beyond expectation.
###421 UNCLE LUKE: Hey, I'm a food--
###423 being that I'm a former chef, I always gotta
###427 find the good food.
###429 EDDIE HUANG: You were telling me, you were a chef before you
###431 were a rapper.
###431 UNCLE LUKE: Yeah.
###432 While I was cooking, my night job was DJing.
###435 EDDIE HUANG: OK.
###436 UNCLE LUKE: So I DJed, and then I started bringing
###439 concerts down.
###440 So I started making more money.
###442 Then, I mean, the money--
###444 going to work at a day job didn't mean nothing, so
###447 eventually I just stopped doing that.
###449 EDDIE HUANG: That's the thing though, for a lot of artists,
###450 a lot of entrepreneurs, when they're trying to get their
###452 shit poppin', you work in a restaurant.
###454 UNCLE LUKE: You work in a restaurant.
###455 EDDIE HUANG: Easiest thing to do is work shifts in a
###456 restaurant.
###458 What's that, fried snow crab?
###459 I gotta taste one.
###460 I gotta try one of them.
###462 UNCLE LUKE: I hope this ain't y'all first day shooting,
###465 'cause y'all gonna be fucked up for the rest of the week.
###467 You'll be running over here.
###468 No, this guy--
###469 EDDIE HUANG: This is crazy.
###470 UNCLE LUKE: Conch Daddy is the best.
###473 -122nd and 27th Avenue.
###476 And we also got National Tires, my main man, too.
###479 EDDIE HUANG: You know what's funny, is when people tell
###481 chefs, oh, you a chef, just do the chef thing.
###483 You got this, you got the tire shop.
###485 I do everything.
###486 You've got to get paper every which way.
###489 UNCLE LUKE: Fucking producer.
###489 [LAUGHTER]
###491 UNCLE LUKE: I done took you out to the mountain-top.
###492 You're always supposed to get me last.
###496 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah.
###496 UNCLE LUKE: You supposed to get the king last.
###498 EDDIE HUANG: No, but we needed a key to the city.
###500 UNCLE LUKE: Hey, man, only way I could give you
###502 the key to the city?
###503 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah?

###527 Only with the Uncle Luke condom.

###535 -This boat symbolizes, really, you know, you're out there,
###540 you're trying to make a living, you know--
###542 this shows you real life.
###545 This is real life, here.
###546 And then, of course, it also symbolizes a journey.
###548 We came over here.
###550 But at the end of the day, this is how
###552 things are being done.
###553 -Good job, Chef!
###555 That's delicious, man.
###556
