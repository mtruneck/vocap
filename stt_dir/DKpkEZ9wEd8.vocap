###41 
###44 SPIKE JONZE: Where does Vice go from here?
###46 What's the plan for your company?
###49 SHANE SMITH: I think that because it's getting bigger
###52 and bigger now, it's either going to become a next
###54 generation media company, or it's going to flare out.
###58 Just really spectacularly.
###60 We're just going to spend $100 million on a party and then
###63 not show up the next day.
###65 End up in Vietnam selling Cokes on the beach.
###67 
###71 SPIKE JONZE: How are you going to decide which
###72 way to go with it?
###72 SHANE SMITH: Well, I won't decide.
###73 SPIKE JONZE: Oh.
###74 SHANE SMITH: It'll be a thing.
###77 SPIKE JONZE: When are you that your happiest?
###79 
###84 SHANE SMITH: I'm at my happiest when I'm in my bed
###87 with my wife and my baby, because I
###89 love them both insanely.
###91 Like, it's like love you've never felt before.
###93 Like, you have a baby, and you're just like, all I want
###96 to do is make the baby happy.
###99 
###101 I was a pretty selfish guy my whole life.
###105 I was essentially a teenager till I was
###106 like, in my late 30's.
###109 And I lived for my own pleasure, and you know, ego.
###115 And then when you have a kid, your ego goes out the window,
###118 and all your pleasure--
###119 not all of it, but like, comes from them.
###122 And oh, I bought a house.
###124 That makes me feel happy, but not for me.
###126 But because like, my kid has a place to live, and my wife as
###129 a place to have the baby.
###131 That's when I'm happiest.
###132 But I like shooting.
###134 I like coming to crazy places and shooting.
###137 Not because of the shooting and stuff, but because it
###139 forces me to think about stuff that I've never
###141 thought about before.
###142 You know?
###143 And so that makes me happy.
###144 
###147 SPIKE JONZE: How should this interview end?
###148 
###153 SHANE SMITH: You should ask me how it all ends.
###158 SPIKE JONZE: Shane Smith, how does it all end?
###160 
###165 SHANE SMITH: I just got married, and I had a baby.
###169 And now I want to build a family seat.
###175 And I want to find it by a beautiful cove, like this one.
###181 Remote.
###182 And I want to build a house where my kids can grow up, and
###186 where you can come visit me.
###188 And the young kids can make Vice, and we can make books
###193 and movies, and TV shows.
###195 Or model airplanes.
###197 Or whatever the fuck we want to make.
###199 And we'll grow old happy.
###201 We'll grow big beards, and we'll eat sausages.
###206 And we'll drink lemonade.
###208 And we'll lie in the hammock.
###211 And we'll discuss why you're still a bastard.
###217 SPIKE JONZE: OK.
###218 
###222 SHANE SMITH: Can we go for a swim now, papi?
###224 SPIKE JONZE: Yeah.
