###16 MIKE HATCHETT: Dave broke his femur in 1994, and that was
###19 kind of the beginning of the end for Dave.
###21 And he had dabbled around filming a little bit.
###24 But that next year's when he actually, in '95, when he
###27 picked up a camera and actually started shooting.
###28 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###34 DAVE HATCHETT: Definitely, the first couple of years were
###36 tough behind the camera and watching all the new riders
###39 ride the lines.
###39 And especially when one of the rookies would blow it, I'm
###42 like, dude, I could ride that thing.
###44 Come on.
###46 But at the same time, it was kind of a relief to not be so
###49 putting your ass on the line.
###51 And the kind of riding that I did--
###53 the big mountain riding and just going fast through rock
###56 lines and trying to flash these wicked chutes and rocky,
###60 peppery lines--
###61 it's a bit of a relief, for sure, to be behind the camera.
###64 MIKE HATCHETT: He doesn't have any formal experience or
###66 training, other than me just saying, here's a
###68 camera, there you go.
###71 Focus.
###71 Composition.
###72 I just explained a few things to him.
###73 And he just basically started pointing and shooting.
###75 So that's how Dave learned.
###77 DAVE HATCHETT: One of my favorite shots that I've ever
###78 shot of a snowboarder was Tom Burt doing the Tom Burt Spines
###82 up on Donner.
###83 And I actually had to rope in to film it.
###85 I had to use snowboards as a belay.
###87 And I put a harness on it, and I got down on this ledge.
###89 And I got this kind of cool shot where I kind of panned
###92 the camera, and he came down, and he fell away.
###94 And it just looked really cool.
###95 It gave it a really cool perspective.
###96 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###106 DAVE HATCHETT: And the line was just incredible.
###108 The line had never been snowboarded before.
###110 It was one of the steepest, gnarliest spines for sure, at
###113 that point, that anyone had ever done.
###114 And Tom greased it really well on the snowboard, and I got
###117 the shot really good, too.
###118 So it was kind of really satisfying to see those
###120 elements come together as a team, as Tom as a rider, and
###124 me as a filmer.
###125 It was almost as satisfying as riding it myself, although I
###129 don't know if I'd actually ride that line.
###130 Maybe.
###131 JEREMY JONES: When Stanner was shooting TB6, I was up there
###135 just dirtbagging it.
###136 And the Hatchetts saw my tracks in the mountains and
###139 were like, we'd love to look at that footage.
###142 They had already had TB6 pretty darn close to cut, and
###145 then they got this footage and were like, we've got to put
###147 this in the movie.
###148 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###169 JEREMY JONES: Still to this day, going down to Spreckels
###171 Theatre in San Diego for the premiere, I'm still like, I'm
###175 in there, I don't know exactly how much.
###177 And then my stuff comes on at the end of the movie, and just
###183 seemingly, the place erupted in like the loudest cheer I'd
###188 ever heard.
###188 And I was shaking after that.
###191 It was one of the highlights of my snowboard career.
###193 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###206 MIKE HATCHETT: We used to do all the main world premieres
###209 at Spreckels Theatre.
###212 And look, this is the second row totally full.
###214 I think it sat 1,200 people at the time, and it was packed.
###219 You couldn't even stand.
###220 There was not a seat available in the place.
###222 JEREMY JONES: Hearing all these people who didn't know
###225 who I was--
###226 I was unheard of--
###228 and just a full house of one of the loudest cheers of the
###232 night was a really cool thing.
###234 
###250 JUSSI OKSANEN: When I grew up, I liked Standard movies, but
###253 I've never really appreciated the powder riding
###257 and lines and stuff.
###258 And the first day I went out, I went with
###262 Burt and Noah Salasnek.
###265 And they were riding some lines in Tahoe Donner and it
###270 was so humbling.
###271 I was just like, holy shit.
###274 And it just put everything in perspective, like what those
###279 guys were doing and how good they were.
###281 LONNIE KAUK: Michael would always just randomly send
###284 these videos to my dad.
###286 And my dad would be like, yo, dude, check this out.
###288 And I'd be like, dude, that is the sickest
###289 thing I've ever seen.
###291 It's just so cool.
###292 I was like, who are these guys?
###293 Like, these guys were just shredding all the time.
###297 Like, that's what I want to do.
###298 MIKE HATCHETT: I had heard about Lonnie through the
###300 grapevine, obviously, ripping the park in Mammoth.
###302 And everybody would always say, Lonnie just laps the park
###305 all day to the bitter end and just stomps
###307 everything, goes huge.
###308 And I just looked, and I could just tell that if he was given
###312 the opportunity with the right film crew and the right riders
###315 that he was probably going to shine and do really well.
###318 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###326 LONNIE KAUK: There's no future, yeah.
###329 But the future was just the next day when you could go
###331 shred and then watching the movies and seeing the guys.
###334 But then I'm like, damn, I'm so far from this.
###336 And I started--
###338 I got a job at Mammoth, being a janitor.
###341 And it's so funny, because today was the first time I met
###344 Kevin Jones.
###345 And I was like, dude, you've got no idea, dude.
###347 Last time I seen you, I was freaking mopping the floor at
###351 Main Lodge, dude.
###352 So that's pretty sick.
###354 MIKE HATCHETT: I finally decided, you know what, I
###356 think it's time to give Lonnie a chance, give him a shot at
###359 filming with us.
###360 And I've always gone the extra mile for Lonnie, because I've
###363 known his dad, and I've known his upbringing in
###365 Yosemite and stuff.
###366 And I'm stoked to see how far he's come.
###369 XAVIER DE LE RUE: It's like, to be honest, growing up where
###371 we grew up, it's just impossible to think about
###374 where we've been getting.
###377 And Mike definitely helped me a lot.
###379 And has been basically giving me so much opportunities.
###383 Like right now, my career has just got to the next level
###387 because of Standard Films.
###389 JUSSI OKSANEN: Those guys just worked so hard.
###391 And that's all I knew.
###394 So I just went with the flow, because I didn't really speak
###396 English or anything.
###398 I really wanted to work, but I was just kind
###399 of out of my element.
###401 And then being in the backcountry too, that was--
###404 I've never ridden powder before, really, that year.
###408 TIM MANNING: Off the resort is a whole other situation.
###411 So we sometimes called it snowboard film tryouts,
###415 because we'd take a crew of guys in the backcountry for
###418 their first time and try to survive throughout the day.
###421 Keep them away from cornices, keep them away from dangerous
###425 situations that they had no idea what they
###428 were involved with.
###429 But we knew that if we could just get them to these jumps
###432 that we wanted to build, it was a fairly safe situation.
###436 And then they could do their stuff.
###437 JEREMY JONES: The Hatchett brothers are incredible
###440 teachers of everything to do with filming.
###444 So these riders that come up--
###447 Jussi Oksanen and Kevin Jones, you name it--
###451 they showed these guys where to build jumps, how to build
###454 jumps, just doing everything they could to help everyone to
###460 go into the mountains safely and ride cool stuff.
###462 
###474 CHAS GULDEMOND: Obviously, the TB series was amazing.
###479 All those older guys just murdered it, and we're still
###483 trying to live up to what they did then.
###486 But now, kind of in our own way, spinning like maniacs and
###489 hitting big park jumps, and it's kind of crazy.
###492 But I'm pretty stoked to be part of this generation, as
###497 well as jealous to not be in the generation
###499 of all those dudes.
###502 MIKE HATCHETT: TB4 to 6 was when the pendulum just swang,
###506 and the video sales were going through the ceiling,
###508 sponsorships were up, all the riders were getting paid good.
###512 And it was just like, yeah.
###512 It was just all of a sudden like, yeah, I can buy a house
###515 now, I can make a living off of this.
###517 And that lasted until like 2010, and then it slowly
###520 started tapering off.
###522 And now, it's just a completely
###524 different ball game.
###524 Now, you just really don't make that much of money making
###527 a snowboard video.
###527 And I never got into it to make money, so I don't feel
###532 much different.
###532 I got into it because I like to make movies, and I like
###534 snowboarding.
###535 So the money thing's never really--
###538 it was great when it was there, and we made good cash.
###540 And I saved some of it and then lost it all.
###542 And now I--
###544 it's like making TB2 again--
###546 broke and making a video.
###548 But it still feels good.
###549
