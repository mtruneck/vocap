2
0:0:24,48 --> 0:0:25,11
KARLEY SCIORTINO: Hi.


3
0:0:25,11 --> 0:0:26,56
I'm Karley.


4
0:0:26,56 --> 0:0:30,17
I've been writing my blog
Slutever for four years now.


5
0:0:30,17 --> 0:0:33,82
I write about stuff like sex,
dating, and how stressful it


6
0:0:33,82 --> 0:0:35,5
can be having a vagina.


7
0:0:35,5 --> 0:0:38,7
And then sometimes I write
about weirder stuff, like


8
0:0:38,7 --> 0:0:42,23
fetish, obscure porn, and
magical masturbation rituals.


9
0:0:42,23 --> 0:0:43,6
I like to think of
Slutever as an


10
0:0:43,6 --> 0:0:46,8
investigation into sexual behavior.


11
0:0:46,8 --> 0:0:48,3
You know, whatever.


12
0:0:48,3 --> 0:0:50,49
Recently while pondering
deep thoughts via the


13
0:0:50,49 --> 0:0:52,52
web, I got to thinking--


14
0:0:52,52 --> 0:0:54,61
what is the meaning
of life, anyways?


15
0:0:54,61 --> 0:0:56,72
And who should I go out with?


16
0:0:56,72 --> 0:0:57,91
You know what I mean?


17
0:0:57,91 --> 0:0:59,62
Finding someone who wants
to fuck you back


18
0:0:59,62 --> 0:1:1,82
can be really hard.


19
0:1:1,82 --> 0:1:5,17
Dating is so stressful and
scary and convoluted.


20
0:1:5,17 --> 0:1:6,68
There's so much to
think about.


21
0:1:6,68 --> 0:1:9,37
Does this dress make
my arms look fat?


22
0:1:9,37 --> 0:1:11,63
How soon is too soon for anal?


23
0:1:11,63 --> 0:1:14,48
Do second cousins
count as incest?


24
0:1:14,48 --> 0:1:16,44
Jeez, it's too much.


25
0:1:16,44 --> 0:1:19,465
To try and make some sense of
it all, I decided to speak


26
0:1:19,465 --> 0:1:22,69
with some dating experts to ask
them some of the questions


27
0:1:22,69 --> 0:1:26,4
us girls have always wanted to
know about the mysteries of


28
0:1:26,4 --> 0:1:27,29
the coital dance.


29
0:1:27,29 --> 0:1:30,68



30
0:1:30,68 --> 0:1:32,82
So I left my Brooklyn apartment
and walked over to


31
0:1:32,82 --> 0:1:34,7
my mom's house.


32
0:1:34,7 --> 0:1:44,1



33
0:1:44,1 --> 0:1:46,17
My mom is really into Jesus.


34
0:1:46,17 --> 0:1:48,595
When I was younger, she used to
force me to watch programs


35
0:1:48,595 --> 0:1:51,545
about chastity that she taped
off the God channel, or


36
0:1:51,545 --> 0:1:52,77
whatever it's called.


37
0:1:52,77 --> 0:1:56,52
Still, she started dating my
dad when she was 16, which


38
0:1:56,52 --> 0:2:0,22
means they've been together
for roughly 100 years.


39
0:2:0,22 --> 0:2:3,38
So she must have some tips to
offer on how to find the one.


40
0:2:3,38 --> 0:2:6,8
OK, so what should
I wear on dates?


41
0:2:6,8 --> 0:2:9,19
TRACEY SCIORTINO: Showing
everything on a date is awful.


42
0:2:9,19 --> 0:2:12,33
Just don't have like a really,
really tight, short


43
0:2:12,33 --> 0:2:13,884
skirt and low shirt.


44
0:2:13,884 --> 0:2:15,692
KARLEY SCIORTINO: Like,
vagina-like skirts?


45
0:2:15,692 --> 0:2:16,596
TRACEY SCIORTINO:
No vagina-like.


46
0:2:16,596 --> 0:2:17,5
Ever.


47
0:2:17,5 --> 0:2:19,9
KARLEY SCIORTINO: So what
qualities do you think I


48
0:2:19,9 --> 0:2:22,49
should be looking
for in a guy?


49
0:2:22,49 --> 0:2:23,625
TRACEY SCIORTINO: Um, somebody
who has self-respect and


50
0:2:23,625 --> 0:2:24,71
respects you.


51
0:2:24,71 --> 0:2:27,74
Somebody with a sense
of humor.


52
0:2:27,74 --> 0:2:28,305
He has to be handsome.


53
0:2:28,305 --> 0:2:31,195
And someone that you don't have
to worry about, you know,


54
0:2:31,195 --> 0:2:33,57
when-- you know, when they
walk out the door.


55
0:2:33,57 --> 0:2:36,27
KARLEY SCIORTINO: What about
guys who have-- you know, date


56
0:2:36,27 --> 0:2:37,11
multiple people at once?


57
0:2:37,11 --> 0:2:38,56
TRACEY SCIORTINO: Don't
date them, Karley.


58
0:2:38,56 --> 0:2:38,95
Wait.


59
0:2:38,95 --> 0:2:39,73
Honestly, though.


60
0:2:39,73 --> 0:2:40,12
Don't.


61
0:2:40,12 --> 0:2:41,57
KARLEY SCIORTINO: If you're on
a date with someone, and it's


62
0:2:41,57 --> 0:2:45,12
the first date, and it's going
really well, how far should


63
0:2:45,12 --> 0:2:48,425
you go with a guy?


64
0:2:48,425 --> 0:2:50,9
TRACEY SCIORTINO: You
should kiss him.


65
0:2:50,9 --> 0:2:52,4
That's it.


66
0:2:52,4 --> 0:2:52,6
KARLEY SCIORTINO: Wow.


67
0:2:52,6 --> 0:2:55,63
My mom gave me some really
good, outdated advice.


68
0:2:55,63 --> 0:2:58,62
But I felt like it was time to
speak with a real dating


69
0:2:58,62 --> 0:2:59,75
professional.


70
0:2:59,75 --> 0:3:1,92
Someone with lots of
certificates on their walls


71
0:3:1,92 --> 0:3:4,215
and who owns a website.


72
0:3:4,215 --> 0:3:7,22
So I cabbed it over to the Upper
West Side to sit down


73
0:3:7,22 --> 0:3:10,63
with life coach and dating
expert Tracey Steinberg.


74
0:3:10,63 --> 0:3:12,62
Tracy's helped dozens
of New York women


75
0:3:12,62 --> 0:3:14,23
find their soul mates.


76
0:3:14,23 --> 0:3:16,24
So like, why not me?


77
0:3:16,24 --> 0:3:18,94
What advice do you
give to people--


78
0:3:18,94 --> 0:3:20,87
we're kind of an age where
you don't want


79
0:3:20,87 --> 0:3:22,43
to date losers anymore.


80
0:3:22,43 --> 0:3:22,88
You know?


81
0:3:22,88 --> 0:3:24,23
TRACEY STEINBERG: Good.


82
0:3:24,23 --> 0:3:26,57
KARLEY SCIORTINO: We're like,
over dating DJs and we kind of


83
0:3:26,57 --> 0:3:29,29
want to meet someone that you
could potentially spend the


84
0:3:29,29 --> 0:3:30,45
rest of your life with.


85
0:3:30,45 --> 0:3:31,8
TRACEY STEINBERG: I think the
first thing that you should


86
0:3:31,8 --> 0:3:35,93
never, ever tolerate is someone
who is not healthy,


87
0:3:35,93 --> 0:3:37,27
confident, and available.


88
0:3:37,27 --> 0:3:39,86
That an automatic
deal breaker.


89
0:3:39,86 --> 0:3:41,7
That, we don't waste
your time.


90
0:3:41,7 --> 0:3:42,25
KARLEY SCIORTINO: But what
do you mean by healthy?


91
0:3:42,25 --> 0:3:45,81
Because actually, I tend to like
guys that are just like


92
0:3:45,81 --> 0:3:47,44
really skinny, kind
of sickly looking.


93
0:3:47,44 --> 0:3:50,51
And like sometimes I'm into
guys that are disabled.


94
0:3:50,51 --> 0:3:57,8
Like crazy, mentally and
physically handicapped freaks.


95
0:3:57,8 --> 0:4:0,17
And maybe that's not what
I should be doing.


96
0:4:0,17 --> 0:4:1,17
TRACEY STEINBERG: I
think it depends.


97
0:4:1,17 --> 0:4:3,43
If it's giving you the results
that you want,


98
0:4:3,43 --> 0:4:4,93
then keep doing it.


99
0:4:4,93 --> 0:4:6,525
If you want different
results, you have to


100
0:4:6,525 --> 0:4:7,27
do something different.


101
0:4:7,27 --> 0:4:10,51
I just think to go through life
with someone who loves


102
0:4:10,51 --> 0:4:14,88
you so much and who you love
so much is just a wonderful


103
0:4:14,88 --> 0:4:16,18
way to go through life.


104
0:4:16,18 --> 0:4:17,39
KARLEY SCIORTINO:
Love is cool.


105
0:4:17,39 --> 0:4:18,79
TRACEY STEINBERG:
Love is cool.


106
0:4:18,79 --> 0:4:19,37
It's really cool.


107
0:4:19,37 --> 0:4:21,29
KARLEY SCIORTINO: Also getting
too drunk around someone is


108
0:4:21,29 --> 0:4:22,79
bad, 'cause you say stuff that
you wish you didn't say and


109
0:4:22,79 --> 0:4:24,2
then you're like, that's
embarrassing.


110
0:4:24,2 --> 0:4:25,9
TRACEY STEINBERG: Right, because
you turn off your


111
0:4:25,9 --> 0:4:25,81
brain a lot.


112
0:4:25,81 --> 0:4:27,29
You're shutting off
a big part of your


113
0:4:27,29 --> 0:4:28,36
brain when you're drunk.


114
0:4:28,36 --> 0:4:28,835
KARLEY SCIORTINO: Yeah.


115
0:4:28,835 --> 0:4:30,97
Also your vagina turns off
when you're drunk.


116
0:4:30,97 --> 0:4:33,91
TRACEY STEINBERG: You turn
off your brain--


117
0:4:33,91 --> 0:4:34,7
KARLEY SCIORTINO:
And your vagina.


118
0:4:34,7 --> 0:4:36,46
Life coach Tracy taught
me a lot.


119
0:4:36,46 --> 0:4:37,92
But it felt like it was
time to get some


120
0:4:37,92 --> 0:4:39,65
more practical advice.


121
0:4:39,65 --> 0:4:41,91
So I headed back to Brooklyn
to meet up with my friends


122
0:4:41,91 --> 0:4:43,52
Alexis Penny.


123
0:4:43,52 --> 0:4:45,55
Alexis is a hooker drag queen.


124
0:4:45,55 --> 0:4:46,99
He sucks dick for a living.


125
0:4:46,99 --> 0:4:49,12
And also has his own dick.


126
0:4:49,12 --> 0:4:51,8
So I figured he'd be the perfect
person to talk to you


127
0:4:51,8 --> 0:4:54,89
about the more hands-on aspects
of dating, like how to


128
0:4:54,89 --> 0:4:56,31
give a good blow job.


129
0:4:56,31 --> 0:4:58,52
ALEXIS PENNY: The best way to
get a guy off with a blow job


130
0:4:58,52 --> 0:5:0,56
is actually to incorporate
a hand.


131
0:5:0,56 --> 0:5:2,46
And really, like, what
feels good is the


132
0:5:2,46 --> 0:5:4,16
pressure of the lips.


133
0:5:4,16 --> 0:5:7,81
It's not like actually that
empty space within your mouth.


134
0:5:7,81 --> 0:5:9,98
Definitely watch the teeth.


135
0:5:9,98 --> 0:5:10,98
That's the biggest one.


136
0:5:10,98 --> 0:5:13,19
Like that's-- pretty much
the worst blow job is


137
0:5:13,19 --> 0:5:14,3
a toothy blow job.


138
0:5:14,3 --> 0:5:14,893
KARLEY SCIORTINO: Like
wrap your lips around


139
0:5:14,893 --> 0:5:15,393
your teeth like this?


140
0:5:15,393 --> 0:5:15,746
ALEXIS PENNY: Yeah.


141
0:5:15,746 --> 0:5:17,29
Wrap your lips around
your teeth.


142
0:5:17,29 --> 0:5:20,24
I, like, made a concerted effort
when I was younger to


143
0:5:20,24 --> 0:5:22,91
get rid of my gag reflex.


144
0:5:22,91 --> 0:5:26,2
I like to do sort of like a,
like a swirling motion--


145
0:5:26,2 --> 0:5:26,54
KARLEY SCIORTINO: With
your tongue?


146
0:5:26,54 --> 0:5:27,6
ALEXIS PENNY: Yeah.


147
0:5:27,6 --> 0:5:29,76
So it'd be like--


148
0:5:29,76 --> 0:5:32,21
and that way you're getting
like a lot of sensation.


149
0:5:32,21 --> 0:5:33,93
You're basically like
masturbating a


150
0:5:33,93 --> 0:5:34,68
guy with your mouth.


151
0:5:34,68 --> 0:5:35,88
KARLEY SCIORTINO: You
don't want to go at


152
0:5:35,88 --> 0:5:36,89
the head and be like--


153
0:5:36,89 --> 0:5:38,0
ALEXIS PENNY: No.


154
0:5:38,0 --> 0:5:40,15
KARLEY SCIORTINO: What is
the deal with balls?


155
0:5:40,15 --> 0:5:42,32
ALEXIS PENNY: Balls
are really weird.


156
0:5:42,32 --> 0:5:43,39
KARLEY SCIORTINO: OMG.


157
0:5:43,39 --> 0:5:45,97
It seems like everyone has
really strong opinions when it


158
0:5:45,97 --> 0:5:47,15
comes to love.


159
0:5:47,15 --> 0:5:49,8
But before I could call it a
day, I needed to find out what


160
0:5:49,8 --> 0:5:52,92
my friend Dr. Leah Kelly had
to say about all this.


161
0:5:52,92 --> 0:5:55,95
She's a neuroscientist, so I
knew she'd use her smart


162
0:5:55,95 --> 0:5:58,47
powers to tell me what
happens in our brains


163
0:5:58,47 --> 0:6:0,56
when we fall in love.


164
0:6:0,56 --> 0:6:3,37
KARLEY SCIORTINO: So Leah, what
happens in your brain


165
0:6:3,37 --> 0:6:4,84
when you fall in love?


166
0:6:4,84 --> 0:6:8,335
DR. LEAH KELLY: Well, they've
put people in love in brain


167
0:6:8,335 --> 0:6:15,23
scanners, and what they see is
the same area light up that is


168
0:6:15,23 --> 0:6:18,48
rewarding, say, when
you take cocaine.


169
0:6:18,48 --> 0:6:20,12
So you get this rush of this


170
0:6:20,12 --> 0:6:22,13
neurotransmitter called dopamine.


171
0:6:22,13 --> 0:6:25,34
And this is actually different
to what's going on in your


172
0:6:25,34 --> 0:6:27,5
brain in relation to sex.


173
0:6:27,5 --> 0:6:31,51
So sex and love are not
necessarily the same thing.


174
0:6:31,51 --> 0:6:35,14
But when you have sex with the
same person, what happens over


175
0:6:35,14 --> 0:6:38,21
time is that you start to
form an attachment.


176
0:6:38,21 --> 0:6:41,5
And that's mediated by something
called oxytocin.


177
0:6:41,5 --> 0:6:45,65
And that is what
sustains love.


178
0:6:45,65 --> 0:6:47,17
KARLEY SCIORTINO: Gosh,
I feel like I've


179
0:6:47,17 --> 0:6:48,955
learned so much today.


180
0:6:48,955 --> 0:6:51,89
But more than anything, what all
of this made me realize is


181
0:6:51,89 --> 0:6:55,7
that unfortunately, there's no
formula we can follow to find


182
0:6:55,7 --> 0:6:57,38
our soul mates.


183
0:6:57,38 --> 0:7:0,44
We are all equally lost within
this labyrinth of love.


184
0:7:0,44 --> 0:7:2,78
And realistically, dating
and sex are meant to


185
0:7:2,78 --> 0:7:4,44
be clumsy and awkward.


186
0:7:4,44 --> 0:7:7,0
But it's good to create an open
dialogue about this stuff


187
0:7:7,0 --> 0:7:11,24
in order to make our sexuality
a little bit less terrifying.


188
0:7:11,24 --> 0:7:13,72
And if you remember to read
lots of books, take your


189
0:7:13,72 --> 0:7:17,24
vitamins, and not be a total
bore, one day you will find


190
0:7:17,24 --> 0:7:20,8
that special person who will
love you for you, who will


191
0:7:20,8 --> 0:7:23,7
give you semi-regular orgasms
and ask nicely before he puts


192
0:7:23,7 --> 0:7:25,18
it in your butt.


193
0:7:25,18 --> 0:7:26,43
You know, Slutever.


194
0:7:26,43 --> 0:9:26,43
