###5 JASON DILL: Workshop got divided into upriver and
###8 downriver at one point.
###8 And now that Kalis is gone, there's less upriver.
###12 Like Dyrdek, Mikey Taylor, Barra, is so upriver.
###15 INTERVIEWER: What does that mean?
###16 JASON DILL: They're upriver.
###19 They're where--
###20 you know, where TVs exist, the internet, fishing's better.
###26 BILL STROBECK: I could see where it seemed like if Kalis
###28 felt that way, which I feel like he did, that he felt like
###31 he didn't fit in.
###33 JOSH KALIS: First of all, I can't be mad at
###34 anything Fat Bill says.
###36 Because Fat Bill is my homey.
###38 And he can fucking call me a piece of shit jerk-off, and
###44 I'm not going to give a shit because he's Fat Bill.
###47 He's my favorite filmer to film with.
###49 I fucking love Bill.
###51 Dill, on the other hand--
###53 it really bummed me out.
###54 It was like a lack of respect.
###56 It was like, who the fuck are you to talk about me, in one,
###61 Dylan's thing.
###64 You know?
###64 And two, call me upriver.
###67 I mean, my thinking is like, hey, man.
###70 I'm about as street as you get.
###72 You know what I'm saying?
###73 
###79 PATRICK O'DELL: Welcome back to Epicly Later'd.
###81 This episode's about Josh Kalis.
###84 This episode kind of came to be because of the
###85 Dylan Rieder episode.
###87 Dill said some stuff and Kalis didn't like it.
###91 He called me and was bummed and kind of wanted to set the
###94 record straight.
###95 He's like, I got stories.
###96 I was in an insane asylum.
###98 I did this.
###99 I did that.
###100 I was like, all right.
###100 This is gonna be awesome.
###101 
###104 So I first started hearing of him in Timecode.
###107 I really remember him doing kickflip
###108 backside noseblunt slides.
###109 And I think I shot a photo of him doing one.
###111 I just think of backside tricks, like backside
###113 noseblunt slides and backside tail slides.
###115 And crooked hat, like all the way crooked.
###118 And like earrings, and like, dirt 'stache.
###121 So I met up with Kalis and talked about skating.
###125 We talked about Lennie Kirk, Dyrdek, Stevie, Philly,
###129 Chicago, Texas, all this stuff.
###132 So it's cool to interview someone that's
###135 such a skate rat.
###137 Like he's like die-hard skater.
###139 And just go through skate history.
###142 I don't know.
###143 I'm really excited about this episode.
###146 So here it is--
###147 Josh Kalis episode.
###149 Where do you think'd be the best zone?
###151 JOSH KALIS: This is good right here.
###153 
###155 PATRICK O'DELL: These big-ass SoCal houses don't even have
###157 lights in the ceiling anywhere.
###161 JOSH KALIS: Actually, before I skated, my biggest thing was
###164 rollerskating.
###165 I was like this big speedskater kid, you know?
###168 Well, what killed my roller skating was that I
###170 had lied to the cops.
###172 Well, I used to go roller skating every weekend, but
###174 then I lied to the cops about getting kidnapped.
###177 Or not getting kidnapped, but I told them that this
###180 kidnapper was out, like, trying to get me.
###182 It was like the big thing at school, was this kidnapper.
###185 So I lied and said that I met the dude.
###188 And they broke me down in the cop shop.
###189 I mean, they broke me down.
###191 I was tearing.
###191 I told them I was full of shit.
###193 So my dad grounded me from my roller skates
###196 for like six months.
###197 And it was like, that was it.
###199 I didn't even give a shit about it anymore.
###203 Going way back to my first days of skating, it was the
###206 Bones Brigade.
###207 Steve Caballero was probably like my favorite dude out of
###211 all of them.
###212 I don't remember what Powell video it was, but it was
###215 Caballero and Tommy Guerrero and all those dudes were
###218 skating outside.
###219 Like there was a neighborhood.
###221 And that's what I kept watching.
###223 The vert stuff and none of that, I didn't even pay
###225 attention to it.
###226 I just would rewind and fast forward.
###228 And I think that's what got me, right there.
###230 
###235 Gonna do some tricks, man.
###236 
###239 MIKE BLABAC: I first met Josh--
###241 I lived in Lansing, Michigan.
###243 We just kind of knew one another through skating.
###245 He knew that I shot photos.
###247 So he'd come down to Grand Rapids and
###249 shoot photos with me.
###251 It's funny.
###251 He got grounded.
###253 His dad-- like, he stole a bunch of baseball cards and
###256 shit of his dad's, and he got grounded for hella long.
###259 I don't even know how long.
###260 But he lied and he told his dad that I worked for
###262 TransWorld.
###263 So his dad would let him go out and shoot photos with me.
###267 He thought that I was like some magazine photographer.
###269 And I barely knew how to use a camera.
###272 But I was just kind of learning how.
###273 And it's sort of ironic that he's one of the dudes that I
###276 learned how to shoot skate photos of.
###278 That's what he looked like.
###280 It's hella funny.
###280 PATRICK O'DELL: That's Josh?
###281 MIKE BLABAC: Yeah.
###282 That's Josh in 1989.
###284 So that was 21 years ago.
###287 It makes me feel hella old, thinking about how long ago
###289 that was, but yeah.
###290 That was the skate-rat Josh.
###292 
###294 And then I met the Josh with his earrings and fucking pot
###299 leaf and like the thugged-out Josh in SF,
###302 about four years later.
###305 PATRICK O'DELL: And you saw Sheffey then, too, right?
###307 MIKE BLABAC: Back when I lived in Michigan, yeah.
###310 He was the Sheffey with the big hair, you know?
###312 Sheffey from the videos and stuff.
###313 It was sick.
###314 I remember he was just hauling ass, going as fast as you
###318 possibly could.
###318 Yeah, it was insane.
###320 Like crazy--
###322 like how much power he had and how fast he went.
###325 That was the raddest thing about watching
###327 him skate in person.
###328 You know what I mean?
###329 Yeah, he was a pretty main dude.
###331 It just so happened that he lived in Grand Rapids.
###334 JON LEE: I'll show you the three raddest skateboarders
###337 that I know.
###338 The vegetarian powers.
###341 Sean Sheffey, by far the raddest, craziest, gnarliest
###350 skateboarder.
###351 
###353 JOSH KALIS: It was like this myth, urban legend.
###356 And it wasn't until like a year after
###358 that that I was downtown.
###360 We were maybe 50-50-ing granite curbs,
###362 trying to do that shit.
###364 And this dude with this big-ass 'fro just comes
###366 through and back lips one of the full-sized benches.
###370 Our jaws hit the ground.
###371 We were like, Sean Sheffey.
###373 Holy shit, man.
###374 PATRICK O'DELL: It's definitely
###375 like seeing a legend.
###376 JOSH KALIS: Well, one of the cool things about skating with
###379 him back then was like, you didn't want to sit down.
###381 Like he gave you that vibe and that energy, where like, if he
###386 was skating five stairs, he wanted you to skate with him.
###389 I swear to god I learned more tricks that day, just skating
###392 with that dude, than I ever have, even still to this day.
###397 And he would just--
###398 bounce to the next spot, and everybody's trying to
###400 keep up with him.
###402 You know what I mean?
###402 It was sick, dude.
###405 SEAN SHEFFEY: What's up?
###406 PATRICK O'DELL: What up?
###409 JOSH KALIS: Ever since I met him that day, that was like my
###412 drive to want to skate and always skate.
###415 And like, just Sheffey, dude.
###418 The illest dude, ever.
###420 Ever.
###421 PATRICK O'DELL: Does he you remember you from then?
###423 JOSH KALIS: You'll have to ask him.
###425 I've never asked him.
###426 I always played it cool.
###427 Like, that's Sean, you know what I mean?
###429 I ain't fucking with that dude.
###432 PATRICK O'DELL: There's a lot of skate history in here.
###434 SEAN SHEFFEY: I would like to say what's up
###436 to the Wu Tang Clan.
###438 I was 17.
###441 I remember I was going by your house once--
###445 JOSH KALIS: Oh my god, that's the story.
###447 SEAN SHEFFEY: And this elementary school where they
###449 used to skate, with the yellow curbs.
###451 Remember that?
###452 JOSH KALIS: Yeah.
###452 Oh, I can't believe this dude remembers me, man.
###454 SEAN SHEFFEY: Yeah.
###455 JOSH KALIS: Yeah, I was grounded.
###456 I was grounded in my room.
###458 And it must have been for like, I think,
###459 three or four weeks.
###461 I can't believe this story, man.
###462 My dad comes in my room, knocking on the door.
###464 And he's like, hey, there's some guys out in the driveway.
###468 And I was like, what?
###469 So I went out there and I looked, and it was Ted Lee--
###472 SEAN SHEFFEY: Yeah.
###473 JOSH KALIS: And Sheffey.
###475 SEAN SHEFFEY: And myself.
###476 JOSH KALIS: Tooling around in my driveway, trying to see if
###478 I could skate.
###480 
###483 Ted Lee.
###484 
###487 And I was like, oh my god. 'Cause this was after I had
###491 started seeing them downtown.
###492 And my dad let me off grounding to go skate with
###495 these dudes for a while.
###496 He let me off.
###497 I couldn't believe it, man.
###498 That was like the best day in my entire life.
###500 SEAN SHEFFEY: Oh, wow.
###501 He let you out?
###502 Yeah, that's intense.
###503 Cool.
###504 JOSH KALIS: Yeah, that was pretty insane, man.
###506 Damn, you remember that shit.
###508 MALE SPEAKER: Film Jack.
###509 MALE SPEAKER: Less work for you.
###511 Go ahead.
###511 JOSH KALIS: You gonna follow me?
###514 PATRICK O'DELL: Dude, what do you remember about Josh?
###516 SEAN SHEFFEY: Very already mature skater and sharp when
###520 we first met him.
###521 He was already known around his city and state as being a
###526 sharp and clean skater.
###528 So I was pretty impressed when I first met him.
###530 JOSH KALIS: Aw, shit.
###531 That's only because I was out with the big dogs.
###533 And I was trying my hardest, dude, to do my thing.
###538 I didn't want to look like no punk out there.
###540 Yeah.
###541 [CAR HORN HONKING]
###544 JOSH KALIS: Huh.
###545 
###548 SEAN SHEFFEY: Great experience to see how far he's came with
###550 his skateboarding and progressed, and the
###553 technicality of it.
###555 I'm very proud to have been a part of that.
###557 
###566 JOSH KALIS: I've always loved Matt Hensley's skating.
###568 He was like a huge one for me.
###571 But I think my early days of learning how to kickflip and
###575 how I want to skate is directly related to Sean's
###579 skating and that influence he gave me, like live.
###583 The downtown-- our little city wasn't that big.
###585 But it was like, we didn't want to skate anything else
###587 besides downtown after we seen Sean down there, you know?
###592 SEAN SHEFFEY: And what is your sign?
###593 JOSH KALIS: Taurus.
###594 SEAN SHEFFEY: Taurus.
###594 Well, bullheaded and strong like one, you are, Mr. Kalis.
###599 Nothing wrong with that.
###601 Pretty cool, yeah.
###602 Pretty cool.
###602 Strong sign.
###604
