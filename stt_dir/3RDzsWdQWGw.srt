2
0:0:5,67 --> 0:0:7,13
Hi, I'm Adam Yamaguchi.


3
0:0:7,13 --> 0:0:8,5
In this episode of Vanguard,


4
0:0:8,5 --> 0:0:9,2
we're taking you


5
0:0:9,2 --> 0:0:10,57
inside a prison.


6
0:0:10,57 --> 0:0:11,7
Now while most people think that


7
0:0:11,7 --> 0:0:12,67
being in a prison is like being


8
0:0:12,67 --> 0:0:13,67
cut off from the rest of the


9
0:0:13,67 --> 0:0:15,8
world, it's not.


10
0:0:15,8 --> 0:0:16,83
Recently, the California


11
0:0:16,83 --> 0:0:17,83
Department of Corrections


12
0:0:17,83 --> 0:0:19,7
offered access inside the prison


13
0:0:19,7 --> 0:0:20,73
systems to look at a problem


14
0:0:20,73 --> 0:0:22,17
that afflicts prisons across


15
0:0:22,17 --> 0:0:23,83
America.


16
0:0:23,83 --> 0:0:24,97
Contributor Janet Choi went to


17
0:0:24,97 --> 0:0:29,23
check out.


18
0:0:29,23 --> 0:0:29,9
(Janet) I'm driving in the


19
0:0:29,9 --> 0:0:30,93
middle of nowhere, halfway


20
0:0:30,93 --> 0:0:32,6
between Los Angeles and San


21
0:0:32,6 --> 0:0:34,7
Francisco, heading to Avenal


22
0:0:34,7 --> 0:0:37,13
State Prison.


23
0:0:37,13 --> 0:0:38,0
I've been invited there to


24
0:0:38,0 --> 0:0:39,4
follow the prison's internal


25
0:0:39,4 --> 0:0:40,9
security unit, the first time


26
0:0:40,9 --> 0:0:42,17
any camera crew has been allowed


27
0:0:42,17 --> 0:0:45,73
to see the ISU team in action.


28
0:0:45,73 --> 0:0:47,73
Their mission: to stop


29
0:0:47,73 --> 0:0:49,0
contraband from getting into


30
0:0:49,0 --> 0:0:50,93
prison.


31
0:0:50,93 --> 0:0:52,2
It may not make sense, but


32
0:0:52,2 --> 0:0:53,3
prison's aren't totally


33
0:0:53,3 --> 0:0:55,2
sealed off environments.


34
0:0:55,2 --> 0:0:56,5
And I was invited to Avenal to


35
0:0:56,5 --> 0:0:58,47
see just how hard it is to keep


36
0:0:58,47 --> 0:0:59,67
inmates from getting stuff


37
0:0:59,67 --> 0:1:6,3
they're not supposed to have.


38
0:1:6,3 --> 0:1:7,17
Contraband is a problem in


39
0:1:7,17 --> 0:1:8,73
prisons across the the country


40
0:1:8,73 --> 0:1:10,53
because nearly all violence and


41
0:1:10,53 --> 0:1:12,7
gang activity in prison can be


42
0:1:12,7 --> 0:1:14,67
traced back it.


43
0:1:14,67 --> 0:1:15,7
They promised full access to


44
0:1:15,7 --> 0:1:17,7
their division, and an


45
0:1:17,7 --> 0:1:18,9
introduction to a new epidemic


46
0:1:18,9 --> 0:1:20,13
in prisons.


47
0:1:20,13 --> 0:1:21,73
Something that you and I didn't


48
0:1:21,73 --> 0:1:25,9
even know was a problem.


49
0:1:25,9 --> 0:1:26,9
>>This is all prison property


50
0:1:26,9 --> 0:1:30,6
that you'll see.


51
0:1:30,6 --> 0:1:33,0
(Janet) As we drove up to meet


52
0:1:33,0 --> 0:1:33,33
with the ISU something was going


53
0:1:33,33 --> 0:1:34,2
on.


54
0:1:34,2 --> 0:1:34,8
>>Yeah, gear it up.


55
0:1:34,8 --> 0:1:37,0
Let's roll.


56
0:1:37,0 --> 0:1:37,97
>>There was a stabbing out


57
0:1:37,97 --> 0:1:47,27
there.


58
0:1:47,27 --> 0:1:48,23
>>So we were about to go inside


59
0:1:48,23 --> 0:1:49,47
and interview the guys who seize


60
0:1:49,47 --> 0:1:50,8
the contraband, only they got


61
0:1:50,8 --> 0:1:51,67
called out because there was a


62
0:1:51,67 --> 0:2:2,1
stabbing on the yard.


63
0:2:2,1 --> 0:2:9,97
>>All right and two visitors.


64
0:2:9,97 --> 0:2:11,4
(Janet) While the ISU was busy I


65
0:2:11,4 --> 0:2:12,47
asked Sargeant Carter, to show


66
0:2:12,47 --> 0:2:13,83
me the prison block and


67
0:2:13,83 --> 0:2:15,87
introduce me to prisoners.


68
0:2:15,87 --> 0:2:17,7
I wanted to find out what the


69
0:2:17,7 --> 0:2:19,2
prisoners were allowed to have.


70
0:2:19,2 --> 0:2:21,4
What do they have in each, what


71
0:2:21,4 --> 0:2:23,5
do you call it, bunk area?


72
0:2:23,5 --> 0:2:24,27
In each dorm?


73
0:2:24,27 --> 0:2:24,77
>>Let's go take a look.


74
0:2:24,77 --> 0:2:25,23
>>Yeah?


75
0:2:25,23 --> 0:2:25,93
You have so little space, what


76
0:2:25,93 --> 0:2:28,63
do you keep in your space?


77
0:2:28,63 --> 0:2:29,27
>>Mostly everything is under my


78
0:2:29,27 --> 0:2:30,4
bunk.


79
0:2:30,4 --> 0:2:31,53
Nothing really fits in my locker


80
0:2:31,53 --> 0:2:32,17
because it's too small, so


81
0:2:32,17 --> 0:2:32,9
we've got everything under our


82
0:2:32,9 --> 0:2:33,63
bunks.


83
0:2:33,63 --> 0:2:34,93
Bags and stuff.


84
0:2:34,93 --> 0:2:36,6
I got a lot of tattoos.


85
0:2:36,6 --> 0:2:37,0
That's my daughter right


86
0:2:37,0 --> 0:2:38,1
there.


87
0:2:38,1 --> 0:2:41,17
Dora, Spongebob.


88
0:2:41,17 --> 0:2:42,63
It's all for my daughter.


89
0:2:42,63 --> 0:2:43,93
It's just, you know, something


90
0:2:43,93 --> 0:2:44,77
to tribute her.


91
0:2:44,77 --> 0:2:45,9
To remember her, because I


92
0:2:45,9 --> 0:2:46,7
don't really see her that much


93
0:2:46,7 --> 0:2:47,77
because I'm incarcerated all


94
0:2:47,77 --> 0:2:48,73
the time.


95
0:2:48,73 --> 0:2:49,77
Since I was about 16, I've been


96
0:2:49,77 --> 0:2:50,7
on the streets probably for


97
0:2:50,7 --> 0:2:52,8
about five months.


98
0:2:52,8 --> 0:2:55,27
I was in and out, juvenile hall,


99
0:2:55,27 --> 0:2:57,9
jail, prison.


100
0:2:57,9 --> 0:3:1,83
>>This is my bunk.


101
0:3:1,83 --> 0:3:5,5
I got a college book that I'm


102
0:3:5,5 --> 0:3:7,27
reading.


103
0:3:7,27 --> 0:3:8,57
This is a watch that I have, got


104
0:3:8,57 --> 0:3:9,93
in a package.


105
0:3:9,93 --> 0:3:11,1
This is a radio that they no


106
0:3:11,1 --> 0:3:12,1
longer allow you to have...if


107
0:3:12,1 --> 0:3:14,4
you already got them, you get to


108
0:3:14,4 --> 0:3:16,13
keep them.


109
0:3:16,13 --> 0:3:19,9
This is a list of CDs.


110
0:3:19,9 --> 0:3:22,27
These are me and my bunkie's


111
0:3:22,27 --> 0:3:23,17
combined, because you're only


112
0:3:23,17 --> 0:3:25,7
allowed to have 12.


113
0:3:25,7 --> 0:3:26,1
It's not much.


114
0:3:26,1 --> 0:3:27,5
It helps to do your time in here


115
0:3:27,5 --> 0:3:29,13
a little better, you know.


116
0:3:29,13 --> 0:3:29,93
So you're not going to be as


117
0:3:29,93 --> 0:3:30,53
stressed out.


118
0:3:30,53 --> 0:3:31,3
If you get stressed out, you can


119
0:3:31,3 --> 0:3:33,43
jump up, read a book, listen to


120
0:3:33,43 --> 0:3:35,83
some music, calm yourself down.


121
0:3:35,83 --> 0:3:36,4
>>You actually have more stuff


122
0:3:36,4 --> 0:3:37,37
than most of the guys we've


123
0:3:37,37 --> 0:3:38,27
seen here.


124
0:3:38,27 --> 0:3:39,33
>>Yeah well actually I've been


125
0:3:39,33 --> 0:3:40,53
down a little longer you know


126
0:3:40,53 --> 0:3:42,23
and over the years things


127
0:3:42,23 --> 0:3:43,67
accumulate.


128
0:3:43,67 --> 0:3:44,17
>>How many pairs of shoes do you


129
0:3:44,17 --> 0:3:45,3
guys have because I'm just


130
0:3:45,3 --> 0:3:45,83
seeing fifty pairs of shoes


131
0:3:45,83 --> 0:3:47,43
under there.


132
0:3:47,43 --> 0:3:51,37
>>I got these and I got the ones


133
0:3:51,37 --> 0:3:53,17
I play outside in.


134
0:3:53,17 --> 0:3:53,83
Tall white guy's got to play


135
0:3:53,83 --> 0:3:54,97
volleyball.


136
0:3:54,97 --> 0:3:55,8
(Janet) Prisoners are allowed a


137
0:3:55,8 --> 0:3:57,43
large variety of things, many of


138
0:3:57,43 --> 0:3:58,73
which surprised me.


139
0:3:58,73 --> 0:4:2,6
Guitars, televisions, ramen.


140
0:4:2,6 --> 0:4:4,43
I rejoined the ISU for a tour of


141
0:4:4,43 --> 0:4:7,83
prison contraband.


142
0:4:7,83 --> 0:4:8,97
>>This is just a fraction.


143
0:4:8,97 --> 0:4:10,37
A lot of stuff, we've gotten


144
0:4:10,37 --> 0:4:11,53
rid of, like the tobacco, we


145
0:4:11,53 --> 0:4:13,33
obviously throw that away.


146
0:4:13,33 --> 0:4:14,17
But a lot of the stuff we get


147
0:4:14,17 --> 0:4:16,8
rid of it, so...


148
0:4:16,8 --> 0:4:17,57
>>From month to month, I try to


149
0:4:17,57 --> 0:4:19,8
photograph our discoveries.


150
0:4:19,8 --> 0:4:22,7
A tobacco, narcotics,


151
0:4:22,7 --> 0:4:23,57
weapons...It's amazing the


152
0:4:23,57 --> 0:4:24,57
stuff that they try to smuggle


153
0:4:24,57 --> 0:4:25,57
in.


154
0:4:25,57 --> 0:4:27,43
It's weird.


155
0:4:27,43 --> 0:4:28,87
Like I think this stuff was,


156
0:4:28,87 --> 0:4:31,43
uh--


157
0:4:31,43 --> 0:4:31,97
>>Rogaine.


158
0:4:31,97 --> 0:4:32,4
>>Rogaine.


159
0:4:32,4 --> 0:4:33,17
Yeah.


160
0:4:33,17 --> 0:4:34,17
>>Oh, that's funny.


161
0:4:34,17 --> 0:4:34,83
>>Yeah, they got to look their


162
0:4:34,83 --> 0:4:35,67
best when they're in the


163
0:4:35,67 --> 0:4:37,83
inmate population.


164
0:4:37,83 --> 0:4:39,43
Pounds and pounds of tobacco.


165
0:4:39,43 --> 0:4:40,37
We brought only just a few out


166
0:4:40,37 --> 0:4:42,1
because we dispose of the stuff.


167
0:4:42,1 --> 0:4:43,23
Because we don't have enough


168
0:4:43,23 --> 0:4:44,93
evidence space, space in our


169
0:4:44,93 --> 0:4:45,87
evidence room to hold this


170
0:4:45,87 --> 0:4:46,5
stuff.


171
0:4:46,5 --> 0:4:47,17
>>Right.


172
0:4:47,17 --> 0:4:49,7
Is that what it looked like?


173
0:4:49,7 --> 0:4:51,27
>>Yeah, this is ready to go.


174
0:4:51,27 --> 0:4:53,7
A little bit of lube and this is


175
0:4:53,7 --> 0:4:55,2
going in.


176
0:4:55,2 --> 0:4:57,4
Prison wallet, their rectal


177
0:4:57,4 --> 0:4:59,97
cavity is where this will go.


178
0:4:59,97 --> 0:5:1,83
>>Most guys will be able to


179
0:5:1,83 --> 0:5:5,3
bring three of these at a time.


180
0:5:5,3 --> 0:5:6,63
There are some seasoned veterans


181
0:5:6,63 --> 0:5:7,67
that can do quite a bit more


182
0:5:7,67 --> 0:5:9,6
than that.


183
0:5:9,6 --> 0:5:10,9
They'll just cover up the


184
0:5:10,9 --> 0:5:14,37
sharp parts, and insert it where


185
0:5:14,37 --> 0:5:16,2
it needs to be.


186
0:5:16,2 --> 0:5:16,63
>>And then what?


187
0:5:16,63 --> 0:5:17,4
You give them a laxative or


188
0:5:17,4 --> 0:5:18,37
something?


189
0:5:18,37 --> 0:5:19,0
>>No, we'll put them on


190
0:5:19,0 --> 0:5:20,93
contraband watch.


191
0:5:20,93 --> 0:5:22,33
They're not going to tell us


192
0:5:22,33 --> 0:5:23,4
what's up there.


193
0:5:23,4 --> 0:5:24,97
During the unclothed body search


194
0:5:24,97 --> 0:5:26,53
he has to cough, you'll see


195
0:5:26,53 --> 0:5:30,17
packaging, or some part of it,


196
0:5:30,17 --> 0:5:32,47
and then: Oh, that's a clue.


197
0:5:32,47 --> 0:5:32,83
Might want to put him on


198
0:5:32,83 --> 0:5:33,77
contraband watch.


199
0:5:33,77 --> 0:5:34,3
>>Or they'll lube themselves


200
0:5:34,3 --> 0:5:34,63
up.


201
0:5:34,63 --> 0:5:36,63
They'll have a lot of Vaseline


202
0:5:36,63 --> 0:5:39,23
or lubricant in that area.


203
0:5:39,23 --> 0:5:41,23
>>A wet spot on their pants.


204
0:5:41,23 --> 0:5:42,23
So you can only imagine where


205
0:5:42,23 --> 0:5:43,67
someone would hide one of these,


206
0:5:43,67 --> 0:5:45,7
right?


207
0:5:45,7 --> 0:5:46,0
>>Pounds and pounds of tobacco.


208
0:5:46,0 --> 0:5:47,53
Roughly, this is a can of


209
0:5:47,53 --> 0:5:48,57
Bugler.


210
0:5:48,57 --> 0:5:49,1
OK.


211
0:5:49,1 --> 0:5:50,9
This has been vacuumed sealed.


212
0:5:50,9 --> 0:5:51,8
A can of Bugler on the street


213
0:5:51,8 --> 0:5:55,77
goes for about 12 bucks.


214
0:5:55,77 --> 0:5:56,27
>>With papers and all.


215
0:5:56,27 --> 0:5:58,53
>>With rolling papers.


216
0:5:58,53 --> 0:6:0,27
This here in the institution is


217
0:6:0,27 --> 0:6:3,27
about 400 dollars?


218
0:6:3,27 --> 0:6:5,3
>>If you buy it at the can rate,


219
0:6:5,3 --> 0:6:7,4
it's about three to $400.


220
0:6:7,4 --> 0:6:8,73
If you break that down and sell


221
0:6:8,73 --> 0:6:9,73
it at individual cigarettes like


222
0:6:9,73 --> 0:6:10,6
most of them do, you're


223
0:6:10,6 --> 0:6:11,77
probably looking at a $1,000.


224
0:6:11,77 --> 0:6:12,77
>>It's a big lucrative


225
0:6:12,77 --> 0:6:14,7
business right now.


226
0:6:14,7 --> 0:6:15,73
>>And is it organized crime?


227
0:6:15,73 --> 0:6:16,83
Is it randoms just trying to


228
0:6:16,83 --> 0:6:19,1
make a buck?


229
0:6:19,1 --> 0:6:21,53
>>Well, um, it's gang related.


230
0:6:21,53 --> 0:6:22,23
A lot of it's um, for the


231
0:6:22,23 --> 0:6:24,37
gang.


232
0:6:24,37 --> 0:6:25,63
Bottom line is, gangs and dope


233
0:6:25,63 --> 0:6:27,27
and gangs and money, and


234
0:6:27,27 --> 0:6:28,7
that's what you have.


235
0:6:28,7 --> 0:6:30,47
That is their sole mission is to


236
0:6:30,47 --> 0:6:32,17
make money.


237
0:6:32,17 --> 0:6:36,17
It's $1,153.


238
0:6:36,17 --> 0:6:37,1
As you can see.


239
0:6:37,1 --> 0:6:38,6
He counted it and wrote it on


240
0:6:38,6 --> 0:6:40,47
the envelope for us, so we


241
0:6:40,47 --> 0:6:42,6
didn't have to do the math.


242
0:6:42,6 --> 0:6:45,1
But I'm sure that's just one


243
0:6:45,1 --> 0:6:46,67
small sample of what's out


244
0:6:46,67 --> 0:6:47,63
there.


245
0:6:47,63 --> 0:6:49,53
>>Contraband is big business.


246
0:6:49,53 --> 0:6:51,3
And all business in prison is


247
0:6:51,3 --> 0:6:53,17
run by the gangs.


248
0:6:53,17 --> 0:6:54,57
I returned to yard to see if any


249
0:6:54,57 --> 0:6:56,53
of the inmates would share their


250
0:6:56,53 --> 0:6:57,6
experiences in the prison


251
0:6:57,6 --> 0:6:58,97
economy.


252
0:6:58,97 --> 0:7:0,13
They were reluctant to speak.


253
0:7:0,13 --> 0:7:2,27
You guy been having some issues


254
0:7:2,27 --> 0:7:3,17
up here?


255
0:7:3,17 --> 0:7:3,63
(producer) Can you say why


256
0:7:3,63 --> 0:7:5,7
there's been rioting?


257
0:7:5,7 --> 0:7:5,87
(man off camera) No.


258
0:7:5,87 --> 0:7:6,87
>>Well, some of us just don't


259
0:7:6,87 --> 0:7:15,3
get along sometimes.


260
0:7:15,3 --> 0:7:15,9
There's some things that we


261
0:7:15,9 --> 0:7:18,53
can't talk about.


262
0:7:18,53 --> 0:7:18,8
Because it's our world in


263
0:7:18,8 --> 0:7:19,57
here.


264
0:7:19,57 --> 0:7:20,37
>>Yeah, you can stay by


265
0:7:20,37 --> 0:7:21,97
yourself, but then, if something


266
0:7:21,97 --> 0:7:23,17
happens, if you get in trouble


267
0:7:23,17 --> 0:7:24,8
by yourself, you're on your


268
0:7:24,8 --> 0:7:27,37
own.


269
0:7:27,37 --> 0:7:28,3
>>And like a lot of people, like


270
0:7:28,3 --> 0:7:29,4
I just had a visit last weekend,


271
0:7:29,4 --> 0:7:30,33
and my mom asked me, "Well why


272
0:7:30,33 --> 0:7:31,93
do you have to get involved?"


273
0:7:31,93 --> 0:7:34,3
Well, that's just prison mom.


274
0:7:34,3 --> 0:7:35,47
>>So, you're always prepared?


275
0:7:35,47 --> 0:7:37,6
>>You have to always be ready.


276
0:7:37,6 --> 0:7:38,2
(Janet) The inmates were


277
0:7:38,2 --> 0:7:39,87
signaled from off camera to stop


278
0:7:39,87 --> 0:7:41,3
answering questions and our


279
0:7:41,3 --> 0:7:43,3
interview was over.


280
0:7:43,3 --> 0:7:44,5
It made sense.


281
0:7:44,5 --> 0:7:45,73
I was being escorted by an


282
0:7:45,73 --> 0:7:46,63
officer.


283
0:7:46,63 --> 0:7:47,67
And they they were being watched


284
0:7:47,67 --> 0:7:49,27
by a gang member who refused to


285
0:7:49,27 --> 0:7:50,9
be filmed.


286
0:7:50,9 --> 0:7:53,0
I was starting to understand, 90


287
0:7:53,0 --> 0:7:53,97
percent of prison is spent


288
0:7:53,97 --> 0:7:55,7
watching.


289
0:7:55,7 --> 0:7:57,73
The guards watch the prisoners,


290
0:7:57,73 --> 0:7:58,53
and the prisoners watch the


291
0:7:58,53 --> 0:8:1,13
guards.


292
0:8:1,13 --> 0:8:2,3
It is a never ending game of


293
0:8:2,3 --> 0:8:3,53
hide and seek, where the stakes


294
0:8:3,53 --> 0:8:7,17
are anything but playful.


295
0:8:7,17 --> 0:8:9,1
So when we met you today, you


296
0:8:9,1 --> 0:8:10,27
immediately left because there


297
0:8:10,27 --> 0:8:11,27
was an assault on one of the


298
0:8:11,27 --> 0:8:11,73
yards?


299
0:8:11,73 --> 0:8:12,4
>>There was an assault on one of


300
0:8:12,4 --> 0:8:13,73
the yards.


301
0:8:13,73 --> 0:8:15,17
And a Code 2 was called, and


302
0:8:15,17 --> 0:8:16,17
what we do is we go out to


303
0:8:16,17 --> 0:8:17,9
assist.


304
0:8:17,9 --> 0:8:20,77
>>Is gang related activity so


305
0:8:20,77 --> 0:8:22,4
prevalent that you assume


306
0:8:22,4 --> 0:8:24,5
automatically, that I know


307
0:8:24,5 --> 0:8:26,27
you're still investigating,


308
0:8:26,27 --> 0:8:27,93
but you assume that an assault


309
0:8:27,93 --> 0:8:28,77
like that is because someone


310
0:8:28,77 --> 0:8:29,33
didn't do their end of the


311
0:8:29,33 --> 0:8:30,17
deal?


312
0:8:30,17 --> 0:8:30,8
>>Something like that needs to


313
0:8:30,8 --> 0:8:31,8
sanctioned.


314
0:8:31,8 --> 0:8:32,87
They can't just same, come on


315
0:8:32,87 --> 0:8:36,0
dude, let's go out there and


316
0:8:36,0 --> 0:8:36,67
hit this guy.


317
0:8:36,67 --> 0:8:38,5
They have to get the OK from


318
0:8:38,5 --> 0:8:40,87
their superiors to go do this.


319
0:8:40,87 --> 0:8:42,13
A lot of your assaults depend on


320
0:8:42,13 --> 0:8:44,3
depend on this right here...on


321
0:8:44,3 --> 0:8:45,7
the flow of contraband coming


322
0:8:45,7 --> 0:8:47,4
in.


323
0:8:47,4 --> 0:8:48,67
This is all business.


324
0:8:48,67 --> 0:8:50,23
It's all about money.


325
0:8:50,23 --> 0:8:52,3
Don't let anybody tell you


326
0:8:52,3 --> 0:8:53,3
anything different.


327
0:8:53,3 --> 0:8:55,9
It's all about money.


328
0:8:55,9 --> 0:8:57,2
(Janet) I travelled to Avenal to


329
0:8:57,2 --> 0:8:59,5
embed myself with the ISU, the


330
0:8:59,5 --> 0:9:0,47
internal security unit charged


331
0:9:0,47 --> 0:9:1,7
with rooting out prison


332
0:9:1,7 --> 0:9:3,9
contraband.


333
0:9:3,9 --> 0:9:5,2
Avenal state prison was designed


334
0:9:5,2 --> 0:9:7,67
to hold 2,500 prisoners.


335
0:9:7,67 --> 0:9:10,33
It currently holds 6,500.


336
0:9:10,33 --> 0:9:13,5
That is 260 percent capacity.


337
0:9:13,5 --> 0:9:15,53
Avenal is a level two prison.


338
0:9:15,53 --> 0:9:16,67
That means there is open


339
0:9:16,67 --> 0:9:17,87
housing.


340
0:9:17,87 --> 0:9:18,63
And the prisoners are allowed


341
0:9:18,63 --> 0:9:20,6
more freedom.


342
0:9:20,6 --> 0:9:22,7
The fact that they don't have


343
0:9:22,7 --> 0:9:23,8
cells with doors, does it make


344
0:9:23,8 --> 0:9:25,23
it easier or harder to find


345
0:9:25,23 --> 0:9:26,27
contraband?


346
0:9:26,27 --> 0:9:29,13
>>I would say it makes it a lot


347
0:9:29,13 --> 0:9:30,7
harder, because they can more


348
0:9:30,7 --> 0:9:31,27
the contraband around a lot


349
0:9:31,27 --> 0:9:32,33
easier.


350
0:9:32,33 --> 0:9:32,97
Because they don't have any


351
0:9:32,97 --> 0:9:33,9
cells or doors, if we search one


352
0:9:33,9 --> 0:9:36,2
dorm, and they could have just


353
0:9:36,2 --> 0:9:37,17
taken it out and moved it to the


354
0:9:37,17 --> 0:9:38,67
next one.


355
0:9:38,67 --> 0:9:39,73
>>So I'm sort of playing a


356
0:9:39,73 --> 0:9:41,3
mental video game as I'm


357
0:9:41,3 --> 0:9:42,5
standing here.


358
0:9:42,5 --> 0:9:43,33
There's like a thousand


359
0:9:43,33 --> 0:9:44,17
different places where you could


360
0:9:44,17 --> 0:9:45,33
hide things.


361
0:9:45,33 --> 0:9:47,87
Like under your hat.


362
0:9:47,87 --> 0:9:48,2
>>Yeah.


363
0:9:48,2 --> 0:9:49,33
Anywhere.


364
0:9:49,33 --> 0:9:51,17
Like in their socks.


365
0:9:51,17 --> 0:9:53,4
Anything they have they could


366
0:9:53,4 --> 0:9:55,77
sew it into their clothing.


367
0:9:55,77 --> 0:9:56,47
It's very difficult to find


368
0:9:56,47 --> 0:9:58,5
contraband.


369
0:9:58,5 --> 0:9:59,33
How would you secure a place


370
0:9:59,33 --> 0:10:1,37
like this and keep it free of


371
0:10:1,37 --> 0:10:2,13
contraband?


372
0:10:2,13 --> 0:10:2,87
Is there anyway to actually do


373
0:10:2,87 --> 0:10:3,87
it?


374
0:10:3,87 --> 0:10:4,7
>>Totally, 100 percent?


375
0:10:4,7 --> 0:10:5,57
No.


376
0:10:5,57 --> 0:10:7,43
I don't think there is a way.


377
0:10:7,43 --> 0:10:8,4
Conservative estimate, we catch


378
0:10:8,4 --> 0:10:12,3
maybe 50 percent of it.


379
0:10:12,3 --> 0:10:13,93
That's conservative, because


380
0:10:13,93 --> 0:10:14,83
there's just too many ways for


381
0:10:14,83 --> 0:10:16,73
the inmates to bring stuff in.


382
0:10:16,73 --> 0:10:17,37
(Janet) With open cells and


383
0:10:17,37 --> 0:10:19,2
thousands of hiding places, 


384
0:10:19,2 --> 0:10:20,1
finding contraband seemed


385
0:10:20,1 --> 0:10:22,6
hopless.


386
0:10:22,6 --> 0:10:23,47
The ISU wanted to show


387
0:10:23,47 --> 0:10:25,5
me the newest trend in prison


388
0:10:25,5 --> 0:10:26,5
contraband.


389
0:10:26,5 --> 0:10:27,67
An item that was showing up in


390
0:10:27,67 --> 0:10:30,7
prisons across the country.


391
0:10:30,7 --> 0:10:31,1
>>These three bags are from


392
0:10:31,1 --> 0:10:34,2
December of '08.


393
0:10:34,2 --> 0:10:35,13
And this is just a portion of


394
0:10:35,13 --> 0:10:36,27
what we found that month.


395
0:10:36,27 --> 0:10:40,7
This isn't everything.


396
0:10:40,7 --> 0:10:41,23
>>Now if you look at this


397
0:10:41,23 --> 0:10:43,53
photograph, this was one


398
0:10:43,53 --> 0:10:45,13
seizure.


399
0:10:45,13 --> 0:10:46,23
You see all the cellphones?


400
0:10:46,23 --> 0:10:47,5
They had them all individually


401
0:10:47,5 --> 0:10:50,1
marked up in little packages,


402
0:10:50,1 --> 0:10:52,17
they had little initials, as to


403
0:10:52,17 --> 0:10:52,93
who was getting what.


404
0:10:52,93 --> 0:10:53,3
>>Oh.


405
0:10:53,3 --> 0:10:53,87
So it was already pre-sold.


406
0:10:53,87 --> 0:10:54,7
>>It was all ready to go.


407
0:10:54,7 --> 0:10:56,43
Somebody had already purchased


408
0:10:56,43 --> 0:10:58,0
this phone.


409
0:10:58,0 --> 0:10:59,1
Different various types cell


410
0:10:59,1 --> 0:11:1,3
phones, from low end to high


411
0:11:1,3 --> 0:11:3,2
type cell phones.


412
0:11:3,2 --> 0:11:4,97
From little what we call throw


413
0:11:4,97 --> 0:11:7,0
down, throw away phones up to


414
0:11:7,0 --> 0:11:10,87
the Blackberrys, the iPhones.


415
0:11:10,87 --> 0:11:13,33
>>The new Blackberry.


416
0:11:13,33 --> 0:11:15,37
These just came out so...


417
0:11:15,37 --> 0:11:17,0
>>Here's a Blackberry.


418
0:11:17,0 --> 0:11:18,13
>>What is that?


419
0:11:18,13 --> 0:11:19,33
The Storm?


420
0:11:19,33 --> 0:11:21,1
>>Yeah, that's what I got.


421
0:11:21,1 --> 0:11:22,3
Do you have any idea what this


422
0:11:22,3 --> 0:11:23,37
stuff is going for?


423
0:11:23,37 --> 0:11:24,53
>>Sure, the low end phones,


424
0:11:24,53 --> 0:11:26,8
they're going for now, three


425
0:11:26,8 --> 0:11:30,4
to five hundred, because the


426
0:11:30,4 --> 0:11:31,67
more we apprehend the stuff,


427
0:11:31,67 --> 0:11:33,2
price and demand of course goes


428
0:11:33,2 --> 0:11:34,47
up.


429
0:11:34,47 --> 0:11:35,37
The higher end cell phones


430
0:11:35,37 --> 0:11:36,5
you're looking at $1000-


431
0:11:36,5 --> 0:11:38,13
$1500 depending on like


432
0:11:38,13 --> 0:11:41,6
Blackberry, iPhone.


433
0:11:41,6 --> 0:11:44,67
If it's camera capability, it's


434
0:11:44,67 --> 0:11:47,4
about five to seven hundred.


435
0:11:47,4 --> 0:11:50,17
>>This one here is the newest


436
0:11:50,17 --> 0:11:51,6
Blackberry Touch, I think


437
0:11:51,6 --> 0:11:53,13
it's called the Storm.


438
0:11:53,13 --> 0:11:53,6
>>That just came out 


439
0:11:53,6 --> 0:11:54,3
a couple months ago.


440
0:11:54,3 --> 0:11:55,77
>>Yeah, they're very expensive 


441
0:11:55,77 --> 0:11:58,6
just to buy, so...


442
0:11:58,6 --> 0:12:0,7
They'll alter their books and


443
0:12:0,7 --> 0:12:1,3
they'll put their cell phones


444
0:12:1,3 --> 0:12:3,33
in there, chargers.


445
0:12:3,33 --> 0:12:4,4
You open it up and it look like


446
0:12:4,4 --> 0:12:6,37
a soup, however.


447
0:12:6,37 --> 0:12:7,0
This is how ingenious these guys


448
0:12:7,0 --> 0:12:8,83
have gotten.


449
0:12:8,83 --> 0:12:11,2
You open this up and there's a


450
0:12:11,2 --> 0:12:12,37
cellphone.


451
0:12:12,37 --> 0:12:14,33
Get the bars of soap out.


452
0:12:14,33 --> 0:12:15,8
There's a...there ya go.


453
0:12:15,8 --> 0:12:19,7
Hollowed out for a cellphone.


454
0:12:19,7 --> 0:12:21,13
>>They'll get DVD players, and


455
0:12:21,13 --> 0:12:22,6
movies, and they'll rent it


456
0:12:22,6 --> 0:12:26,3
out to this guy over here for an


457
0:12:26,3 --> 0:12:28,7
hour or so.


458
0:12:28,7 --> 0:12:29,23
Different movies.


459
0:12:29,23 --> 0:12:30,5
All recent titles.


460
0:12:30,5 --> 0:12:31,8
A lot of it porn.


461
0:12:31,8 --> 0:12:34,5
>>It's an all male facility.


462
0:12:34,5 --> 0:12:36,47
>>There's a market.


463
0:12:36,47 --> 0:12:37,93
>>There was a guy that was


464
0:12:37,93 --> 0:12:39,33
conducting a little video


465
0:12:39,33 --> 0:12:41,5
rental.


466
0:12:41,5 --> 0:12:42,23
He had a sheet of paper of


467
0:12:42,23 --> 0:12:45,17
videos that he had, and he'd


468
0:12:45,17 --> 0:12:45,83
give it to his other


469
0:12:45,83 --> 0:12:48,23
homeboys, "here you go," and it


470
0:12:48,23 --> 0:12:49,77
was a rental.


471
0:12:49,77 --> 0:12:50,33
The same guy that owned that


472
0:12:50,33 --> 0:12:52,1
iPhone too.


473
0:12:52,1 --> 0:12:53,23
Didn't have a job, but you


474
0:12:53,23 --> 0:12:54,67
looked inside his locker, and he


475
0:12:54,67 --> 0:12:57,6
had food and shoes, and he was


476
0:12:57,6 --> 0:12:59,27
just hooked up.


477
0:12:59,27 --> 0:13:1,9
>>Charging?


478
0:13:1,9 --> 0:13:2,47
We'll show you what happens


479
0:13:2,47 --> 0:13:3,57
with that.


480
0:13:3,57 --> 0:13:5,7
When they get the charger, the


481
0:13:5,7 --> 0:13:6,2
first thing they do is modify


482
0:13:6,2 --> 0:13:7,1
it.


483
0:13:7,1 --> 0:13:8,13
>>This is a cell phone charger


484
0:13:8,13 --> 0:13:9,1
with the housing broke off of


485
0:13:9,1 --> 0:13:11,17
it.


486
0:13:11,17 --> 0:13:12,37
That's what you have left, a


487
0:13:12,37 --> 0:13:13,67
little circuit board.


488
0:13:13,67 --> 0:13:15,2
They open up their radios.


489
0:13:15,2 --> 0:13:16,27
They graft it in.


490
0:13:16,27 --> 0:13:18,3
They wire it in.


491
0:13:18,3 --> 0:13:19,17
And they put another headphone


492
0:13:19,17 --> 0:13:21,8
jack.


493
0:13:21,8 --> 0:13:26,1
And now that's all they need


494
0:13:26,1 --> 0:13:27,37
to charge their phones.


495
0:13:27,37 --> 0:13:28,23
>>Who are they calling?


496
0:13:28,23 --> 0:13:28,77
What are the pictures of?


497
0:13:28,77 --> 0:13:30,13
>>Well, a lot of them are


498
0:13:30,13 --> 0:13:32,3
calling loved ones.


499
0:13:32,3 --> 0:13:34,3
The girlfriend.


500
0:13:34,3 --> 0:13:35,77
A lot of them are using it for


501
0:13:35,77 --> 0:13:36,9
their illegal clandestine


502
0:13:36,9 --> 0:13:39,87
business of orchestrating more


503
0:13:39,87 --> 0:13:41,1
contraband drops.


504
0:13:41,1 --> 0:13:43,83
Narcotics drops.


505
0:13:43,83 --> 0:13:45,27
Doing business, not just here at


506
0:13:45,27 --> 0:13:46,33
this institution, but up and


507
0:13:46,33 --> 0:13:47,4
down the state with other


508
0:13:47,4 --> 0:13:49,13
instutitions.


509
0:13:49,13 --> 0:13:51,73
We have inmates


510
0:13:51,73 --> 0:13:52,4
who are coordinating


511
0:13:52,4 --> 0:13:55,93
escapes.


512
0:13:55,93 --> 0:13:56,93
May 4, we had an escape, walk


513
0:13:56,93 --> 0:13:58,5
away from the institution,


514
0:13:58,5 --> 0:14:0,7
inmate had cell phone.


515
0:14:0,7 --> 0:14:1,23
Inmate had a cell phone, was


516
0:14:1,23 --> 0:14:2,17
able to coordinate with somebody


517
0:14:2,17 --> 0:14:3,67
out on the street, and they


518
0:14:3,67 --> 0:14:4,7
picked him up in the city of


519
0:14:4,7 --> 0:14:7,7
Avenal within half an hour of


520
0:14:7,7 --> 0:14:8,9
him leaving the institution.


521
0:14:8,9 --> 0:14:15,4
They're coordinating drug drops


522
0:14:15,4 --> 0:14:18,37
Gangs can conduct their business


523
0:14:18,37 --> 0:14:21,3
now, they can conduct assaults,


524
0:14:21,3 --> 0:14:23,23
murder.


525
0:14:23,23 --> 0:14:25,47
And there's no way to detect


526
0:14:25,47 --> 0:14:26,7
it because they've got a cell


527
0:14:26,7 --> 0:14:27,47
phone.


528
0:14:27,47 --> 0:14:28,77
(Janet) I felt like I understood


529
0:14:28,77 --> 0:14:29,77
the dangers of having cell


530
0:14:29,77 --> 0:14:30,7
phones from the officer's


531
0:14:30,7 --> 0:14:32,3
perspective.


532
0:14:32,3 --> 0:14:32,93
But I was curious to hear what


533
0:14:32,93 --> 0:14:35,5
inmates think of the ban.


534
0:14:35,5 --> 0:14:36,7
I was surprised to hear


535
0:14:36,7 --> 0:14:37,83
that you're not allowed to 


536
0:14:37,83 --> 0:14:41,47
have cell phones.


537
0:14:41,47 --> 0:14:42,3
>>You were surprised to 


538
0:14:42,3 --> 0:14:46,1
hear that?


539
0:14:46,1 --> 0:14:47,5
>>We love the internet.


540
0:14:47,5 --> 0:14:48,4
>>Phone's down there, but


541
0:14:48,4 --> 0:14:49,27
you're gonna pay


542
0:14:49,27 --> 0:14:53,8
five, ten dollars a call


543
0:14:53,8 --> 0:14:54,5
Do you think cell phones should


544
0:14:54,5 --> 0:14:56,43
be allowed in prison?


545
0:14:56,43 --> 0:14:58,37
>>Personally yes.


546
0:14:58,37 --> 0:14:59,9
I don't think it's a major


547
0:14:59,9 --> 0:15:2,37
problem, just being honest with


548
0:15:2,37 --> 0:15:3,27
you, you know.


549
0:15:3,27 --> 0:15:5,1
It would save my momma a whole


550
0:15:5,1 --> 0:15:6,8
bunch of money on collect calls,


551
0:15:6,8 --> 0:15:7,87
just for one.


552
0:15:7,87 --> 0:15:9,73
I guess people can make phone


553
0:15:9,73 --> 0:15:11,8
calls that are unmonitored and


554
0:15:11,8 --> 0:15:13,9
make threats or what have you.


555
0:15:13,9 --> 0:15:16,53
But the same thing can be done


556
0:15:16,53 --> 0:15:20,2
anyway.


557
0:15:20,2 --> 0:15:21,87
If somebody was trying to get


558
0:15:21,87 --> 0:15:24,17
something done to somebody, they


559
0:15:24,17 --> 0:15:25,33
can do it.


560
0:15:25,33 --> 0:15:26,17
There's no limit to it.


561
0:15:26,17 --> 0:15:26,9
There's no stopping it


562
0:15:26,9 --> 0:15:27,83
actually.


563
0:15:27,83 --> 0:15:29,3
So I don't think cell phones


564
0:15:29,3 --> 0:15:31,23
add to that or subtract from


565
0:15:31,23 --> 0:15:32,37
that.


566
0:15:32,37 --> 0:15:33,23
>>What about cell phones?


567
0:15:33,23 --> 0:15:34,33
Were cell phones around--


568
0:15:34,33 --> 0:15:36,23
>No, no.


569
0:15:36,23 --> 0:15:37,2
There wasn't no thing


570
0:15:37,2 --> 0:15:38,47
like cell phones when


571
0:15:38,47 --> 0:15:39,4
I went to jail.


572
0:15:39,4 --> 0:15:39,9
>>Have you ever used a 


573
0:15:39,9 --> 0:15:40,37
cell phone?


574
0:15:40,37 --> 0:15:41,33
>>No, I don't even know how


575
0:15:41,33 --> 0:15:44,0
to use it.


576
0:15:44,0 --> 0:15:47,47
I never even heard or seen them


577
0:15:47,47 --> 0:15:49,73
so I don't know what they are.


578
0:15:49,73 --> 0:15:50,27
Welcome back to our


579
0:15:50,27 --> 0:15:51,43
look at contraband in 


580
0:15:51,43 --> 0:15:52,73
prisons.


581
0:15:52,73 --> 0:15:53,3
So far you've seen how


582
0:15:53,3 --> 0:15:54,67
difficult it is to keep 


583
0:15:54,67 --> 0:15:55,8
contraband such as


584
0:15:55,8 --> 0:15:56,8
weapons, drugs, and


585
0:15:56,8 --> 0:15:58,57
cell phones out of prisons,


586
0:15:58,57 --> 0:15:59,67
no matter how secure


587
0:15:59,67 --> 0:16:1,1
they may seem.


588
0:16:1,1 --> 0:16:2,23
How do officers in prisons 


589
0:16:2,23 --> 0:16:3,2
actually discover this


590
0:16:3,2 --> 0:16:4,5
contraband?


591
0:16:4,5 --> 0:16:5,17
Contributor Janet Choi


592
0:16:5,17 --> 0:16:9,53
finds out.


593
0:16:9,53 --> 0:16:10,63
(Janet) California State Prison


594
0:16:10,63 --> 0:16:12,9
Solano, in Vacaville, CA, is a


595
0:16:12,9 --> 0:16:14,7
three hour drive from Avenal


596
0:16:14,7 --> 0:16:15,6
prison.


597
0:16:15,6 --> 0:16:16,6
I travelled to Solano because I


598
0:16:16,6 --> 0:16:17,83
was curious to see how other


599
0:16:17,83 --> 0:16:19,1
prisons were dealing with


600
0:16:19,1 --> 0:16:20,67
contraband.


601
0:16:20,67 --> 0:16:24,3
Cell phones off.


602
0:16:24,3 --> 0:16:25,73
I was especially curious whether


603
0:16:25,73 --> 0:16:26,9
cell phones were showing up in


604
0:16:26,9 --> 0:16:30,43
the prison population.


605
0:16:30,43 --> 0:16:34,17
>>Right there's just about


606
0:16:34,17 --> 0:16:37,73
1,800 phones.


607
0:16:37,73 --> 0:16:46,3
(Janet) They were.


608
0:16:46,3 --> 0:16:46,37
Wow.


609
0:16:46,37 --> 0:16:47,3
I haven't seen one of those


610
0:16:47,3 --> 0:16:48,0
before.


611
0:16:48,0 --> 0:16:50,83
I think Armani would probably be


612
0:16:50,83 --> 0:16:55,7
a little disappointed.


613
0:16:55,7 --> 0:16:59,27
>>This was in-- He had this one


614
0:16:59,27 --> 0:17:1,9
secreted in his anal cavity.


615
0:17:1,9 --> 0:17:3,2
>>What's the word for that?.


616
0:17:3,2 --> 0:17:4,93
Kavitzing?


617
0:17:4,93 --> 0:17:6,2
What's the word?


618
0:17:6,2 --> 0:17:6,77
(producer) Keister.


619
0:17:6,77 --> 0:17:8,3
>>Keistering.


620
0:17:8,3 --> 0:17:9,3
[laughs].


621
0:17:9,3 --> 0:17:9,73
>>Keister.


622
0:17:9,73 --> 0:17:14,57
Yes, he had it keistered.


623
0:17:14,57 --> 0:17:16,6
>>How do you find that?


624
0:17:16,6 --> 0:17:16,93
>>Pardon me?


625
0:17:16,93 --> 0:17:20,6
>>How do you find that?


626
0:17:20,6 --> 0:17:22,13
>>Sometimes when we do a full


627
0:17:22,13 --> 0:17:23,63
body search, and the way


628
0:17:23,63 --> 0:17:25,73
that's done is they have to


629
0:17:25,73 --> 0:17:27,33
bend and squat and spread their


630
0:17:27,33 --> 0:17:30,43
cheeks, and if you don't have


631
0:17:30,43 --> 0:17:31,13
enough light, you use a


632
0:17:31,13 --> 0:17:32,73
flashlight and shine it on their


633
0:17:32,73 --> 0:17:34,73
anal area.


634
0:17:34,73 --> 0:17:38,17
A lot times you can see, let's


635
0:17:38,17 --> 0:17:40,5
say maybe this was a string that


636
0:17:40,5 --> 0:17:41,53
was tied around this for him to


637
0:17:41,53 --> 0:17:42,4
get ahold of pull out, so you


638
0:17:42,4 --> 0:17:44,17
look for something that really


639
0:17:44,17 --> 0:17:45,13
shouldn't be there.


640
0:17:45,13 --> 0:17:45,73
>>Right.


641
0:17:45,73 --> 0:17:48,47
>>Or if it's got moisture


642
0:17:48,47 --> 0:17:50,23
around it, maybe as you would


643
0:17:50,23 --> 0:17:52,27
use a lotion or something like


644
0:17:52,27 --> 0:17:54,2
that, or a glistening.


645
0:17:54,2 --> 0:17:56,8
Sometimes you ask them to give


646
0:17:56,8 --> 0:17:58,53
it up and they will.


647
0:17:58,53 --> 0:17:59,8
We had one guy who basically


648
0:17:59,8 --> 0:18:1,5
couldn't, and so he had to go


649
0:18:1,5 --> 0:18:2,93
out to the hospital, and they


650
0:18:2,93 --> 0:18:5,37
had to give him a little help in


651
0:18:5,37 --> 0:18:11,3
removing it.


652
0:18:11,3 --> 0:18:11,73
There are some things 


653
0:18:11,73 --> 0:18:15,17
that I can't force you to do.


654
0:18:15,17 --> 0:18:16,3
>>Can't use my grandmother's


655
0:18:16,3 --> 0:18:17,1
method and rub your


656
0:18:17,1 --> 0:18:21,23
belly for a while.


657
0:18:21,23 --> 0:18:22,43
(Janet) I had been impressed by


658
0:18:22,43 --> 0:18:23,8
the ingenuity of the inmates in


659
0:18:23,8 --> 0:18:24,93
Avenal.


660
0:18:24,93 --> 0:18:26,73
I asked if the inmates here had


661
0:18:26,73 --> 0:18:33,1
any tricks.


662
0:18:33,1 --> 0:18:33,6
>>Remove this.


663
0:18:33,6 --> 0:18:34,87
And you can see where he has


664
0:18:34,87 --> 0:18:36,1
this circuit board installed


665
0:18:36,1 --> 0:18:38,0
here, that he's added to the


666
0:18:38,0 --> 0:18:39,5
fan motor.


667
0:18:39,5 --> 0:18:40,23
And there's another wire


668
0:18:40,23 --> 0:18:42,5
coming out the back.


669
0:18:42,5 --> 0:18:45,57
And if you turn it around, you


670
0:18:45,57 --> 0:18:48,3
can see where he's added thatu


671
0:18:48,3 --> 0:18:50,87
circuit board to basically


672
0:18:50,87 --> 0:18:53,63
connect this charger that leads


673
0:18:53,63 --> 0:18:57,67
to the cell phone.


674
0:18:57,67 --> 0:19:0,87
We've been finding these quite


675
0:19:0,87 --> 0:19:2,33
often now.


676
0:19:2,33 --> 0:19:3,17
This is probably the eighth or


677
0:19:3,17 --> 0:19:3,93
ninth fan we've found like


678
0:19:3,93 --> 0:19:5,43
this.


679
0:19:5,43 --> 0:19:5,97
(Janet) Cell phone's have


680
0:19:5,97 --> 0:19:7,1
become a necessity for the


681
0:19:7,1 --> 0:19:9,0
outside world, but I was curious


682
0:19:9,0 --> 0:19:10,4
why the prisoners were going to


683
0:19:10,4 --> 0:19:12,53
such lengths to have them


684
0:19:12,53 --> 0:19:13,7
on the inside.


685
0:19:13,7 --> 0:19:16,57
Prison...you either adapt


686
0:19:16,57 --> 0:19:17,47
or you don't.


687
0:19:17,47 --> 0:19:19,8
I'm in a cell, you're looking


688
0:19:19,8 --> 0:19:22,6
at maybe 12 hours a day,


689
0:19:22,6 --> 0:19:24,63
maybe longer.


690
0:19:24,63 --> 0:19:25,6
You don't understand how


691
0:19:25,6 --> 0:19:29,3
lonely prison can be.


692
0:19:29,3 --> 0:19:31,3
>>I miss, social life, being


693
0:19:31,3 --> 0:19:35,3
with...with significant others.


694
0:19:35,3 --> 0:19:36,5
I miss being with my family.


695
0:19:36,5 --> 0:19:37,23
>>Do you have visitors that come


696
0:19:37,23 --> 0:19:38,87
and visit you?


697
0:19:38,87 --> 0:19:39,47
>>Of course, I've been married


698
0:19:39,47 --> 0:19:40,53
three times.


699
0:19:40,53 --> 0:19:41,53
>>You have?.


700
0:19:41,53 --> 0:19:42,13
But you've been here for nine


701
0:19:42,13 --> 0:19:43,13
years?


702
0:19:43,13 --> 0:19:44,7
>>19.?


703
0:19:44,7 --> 0:19:45,27
I've been down for 19 years,


704
0:19:45,27 --> 0:19:46,3
married three times.


705
0:19:46,3 --> 0:19:47,43
>>So you what you're saying is


706
0:19:47,43 --> 0:19:48,37
you knew all these women before


707
0:19:48,37 --> 0:19:49,63
you came in here.


708
0:19:49,63 --> 0:19:53,17
>>Not necessarily.


709
0:19:53,17 --> 0:19:55,97
I mean I put an ad in one time


710
0:19:55,97 --> 0:19:57,17
in the Sacramento Bee.


711
0:19:57,17 --> 0:19:57,77
And that's how I met my first


712
0:19:57,77 --> 0:20:0,6
wife.


713
0:20:0,6 --> 0:20:1,27
>>Wow.


714
0:20:1,27 --> 0:20:1,93
>>And then you have people on


715
0:20:1,93 --> 0:20:3,27
the internet.


716
0:20:3,27 --> 0:20:4,3
Things are different, times have


717
0:20:4,3 --> 0:20:6,3
changed.


718
0:20:6,3 --> 0:20:6,6
And I'm about to get married


719
0:20:6,6 --> 0:20:7,8
again...maybe.


720
0:20:7,8 --> 0:20:8,27
(Janet) Inmates were 


721
0:20:8,27 --> 0:20:9,7
reluctant to talk about


722
0:20:9,7 --> 0:20:10,17
contraband, fearing


723
0:20:10,17 --> 0:20:12,13
retaliation from the gangs.


724
0:20:12,13 --> 0:20:13,63
As silly as it seems, we're


725
0:20:13,63 --> 0:20:15,67
forced to use code words.


726
0:20:15,67 --> 0:20:17,57
If you wanted to get a 


727
0:20:17,57 --> 0:20:18,53
certain type of cereal that


728
0:20:18,53 --> 0:20:20,43
wasn't in the catalog, you'd


729
0:20:20,43 --> 0:20:21,7
be able to get it?


730
0:20:21,7 --> 0:20:23,53
>>If I really wanted a cell


731
0:20:23,53 --> 0:20:25,17
phone and I had the money


732
0:20:25,17 --> 0:20:26,43
to buy it, I'd probably go


733
0:20:26,43 --> 0:20:27,1
get it.


734
0:20:27,1 --> 0:20:29,93
>>How?


735
0:20:29,93 --> 0:20:30,5
>>You could proabably bring 


736
0:20:30,5 --> 0:20:31,13
it in.


737
0:20:31,13 --> 0:20:31,77
If the money's right, she's


738
0:20:31,77 --> 0:20:34,43
probably willing to do it.


739
0:20:34,43 --> 0:20:35,27
Now, you wonder how I'm


740
0:20:35,27 --> 0:20:36,27
able to meet people, that's just


741
0:20:36,27 --> 0:20:38,3
one sure way of doing it.


742
0:20:38,3 --> 0:20:41,3
If it comes down to that.


743
0:20:41,3 --> 0:20:42,23
(Janet) Talking to this inmate I


744
0:20:42,23 --> 0:20:43,43
understood perhaps the biggest


745
0:20:43,43 --> 0:20:46,23
allure of cellphones.


746
0:20:46,23 --> 0:20:47,97
They were a way off the yard.


747
0:20:47,97 --> 0:20:56,13
If only for a moment.


748
0:20:56,13 --> 0:20:56,77
(producer) Want to show us your


749
0:20:56,77 --> 0:20:58,73
whistle?


750
0:20:58,73 --> 0:20:59,43
>>So, hopefully, I won't have


751
0:20:59,43 --> 0:21:1,47
to use this thing.


752
0:21:1,47 --> 0:21:2,67
This whistle is in case I find


753
0:21:2,67 --> 0:21:28,83
myself in trouble.


754
0:21:28,83 --> 0:21:29,47
In a typical cell, what are you


755
0:21:29,47 --> 0:21:31,7
looking for?


756
0:21:31,7 --> 0:21:32,3
>>In this case, we're looking


757
0:21:32,3 --> 0:21:34,3
for any kind of contraband.


758
0:21:34,3 --> 0:21:34,97
Could be weapons, could be


759
0:21:34,97 --> 0:21:36,23
drugs, could be drug


760
0:21:36,23 --> 0:21:37,7
paraphernalia, could be cell


761
0:21:37,7 --> 0:21:39,33
phones.


762
0:21:39,33 --> 0:21:43,17
Could be any type of article


763
0:21:43,17 --> 0:21:44,87
that they can't have.


764
0:21:44,87 --> 0:21:46,57
And where we're looking is


765
0:21:46,57 --> 0:21:47,7
virtually any area inside the


766
0:21:47,7 --> 0:21:49,1
cell.


767
0:21:49,1 --> 0:21:52,37
Common areas are their books.


768
0:21:52,37 --> 0:21:54,83
Inside their coffee pots.


769
0:21:54,83 --> 0:21:57,3
Under the lids of the toilets,


770
0:21:57,3 --> 0:21:57,9
and some of their hiding places


771
0:21:57,9 --> 0:21:58,6
now, as I was telling you


772
0:21:58,6 --> 0:21:59,67
before, could be behind these


773
0:21:59,67 --> 0:22:2,5
safe plates.


774
0:22:2,5 --> 0:22:5,37
Because...you see these gouges?


775
0:22:5,37 --> 0:22:8,6
They could have twisted this,


776
0:22:8,6 --> 0:22:9,6
gotten behind there and put cell


777
0:22:9,6 --> 0:22:13,33
phones there.


778
0:22:13,33 --> 0:22:32,53
>>Just got a paper clip.


779
0:22:32,53 --> 0:22:36,8
So this toilet is empty.


780
0:22:36,8 --> 0:22:37,67
Come inside here.


781
0:22:37,67 --> 0:22:42,1
Come all the way in.


782
0:22:42,1 --> 0:22:43,4
They've actually figured out a


783
0:22:43,4 --> 0:22:44,93
way to remove these rivets off


784
0:22:44,93 --> 0:22:46,9
these doors.


785
0:22:46,9 --> 0:22:48,2
And this door's hollow.


786
0:22:48,2 --> 0:22:49,7
So once they remove these


787
0:22:49,7 --> 0:22:50,67
rivets, they could basically pry


788
0:22:50,67 --> 0:22:53,17
that plate off, right?


789
0:22:53,17 --> 0:22:54,67
And we've found when they need


790
0:22:54,67 --> 0:22:56,13
to access it, they just pull it


791
0:22:56,13 --> 0:22:57,2
off, and they have their


792
0:22:57,2 --> 0:22:59,63
contraband tied to a string, at


793
0:22:59,63 --> 0:23:2,3
the bottom of the door.


794
0:23:2,3 --> 0:23:2,7
(Janet) Wow, it's hard to breath


795
0:23:2,7 --> 0:23:3,83
in here.


796
0:23:3,83 --> 0:23:5,13
It's hot; I'm sweating.


797
0:23:5,13 --> 0:23:5,77
There's no open windows 


798
0:23:5,77 --> 0:23:7,8
in there.


799
0:23:7,8 --> 0:23:8,47
>>This is pretty much a staple


800
0:23:8,47 --> 0:23:10,87
food.


801
0:23:10,87 --> 0:23:12,3
>>Good old ramen noodles.


802
0:23:12,3 --> 0:23:13,33
College food.


803
0:23:13,33 --> 0:23:13,63
>>Yeah.


804
0:23:13,63 --> 0:23:15,1
It's cheap.


805
0:23:15,1 --> 0:23:19,3
Filling.


806
0:23:19,3 --> 0:23:21,5
They'll have like a hundred of


807
0:23:21,5 --> 0:23:24,73
these things in a bag, and


808
0:23:24,73 --> 0:23:26,13
usually the one at the bottom is


809
0:23:26,13 --> 0:23:29,77
the one with the contraband.


810
0:23:29,77 --> 0:23:30,3
(producer) Is this guy an


811
0:23:30,3 --> 0:23:31,0
affluent inmate, because he has


812
0:23:31,0 --> 0:23:32,23
all this stuff?, 


813
0:23:32,23 --> 0:23:34,2
>>This isn't anything.


814
0:23:34,2 --> 0:23:38,63
Some of these have, five, six,


815
0:23:38,63 --> 0:23:45,1
seven, eight bags of canteen.


816
0:23:45,1 --> 0:23:45,77
Typically, if they have a lot of


817
0:23:45,77 --> 0:23:49,2
canteen, it's typically a sign


818
0:23:49,2 --> 0:23:52,43
that he's involved in some


819
0:23:52,43 --> 0:23:54,4
kind of illegal activity.


820
0:23:54,4 --> 0:23:55,3
Maybe drug related.


821
0:23:55,3 --> 0:23:56,3
Maybe cell phone related.


822
0:23:56,3 --> 0:23:58,3
But he's being paid.


823
0:23:58,3 --> 0:23:59,7
This is their source of payment,


824
0:23:59,7 --> 0:24:1,93
too.


825
0:24:1,93 --> 0:24:4,37
They use that to pay off debts.


826
0:24:4,37 --> 0:24:6,57
These guys bet in here too.


827
0:24:6,57 --> 0:24:7,27
They bet on college teams.


828
0:24:7,27 --> 0:24:9,7
They bet on sports teams.


829
0:24:9,7 --> 0:24:12,3
This is the money.


830
0:24:12,3 --> 0:24:13,3
(Janet) It takes an hour or so


831
0:24:13,3 --> 0:24:14,93
to search a single cell which


832
0:24:14,93 --> 0:24:16,7
makes the battle against


833
0:24:16,7 --> 0:24:20,1
contraband seem hard to win.


834
0:24:20,1 --> 0:24:21,53
But then Officer Medina found


835
0:24:21,53 --> 0:24:22,7
something.


836
0:24:22,7 --> 0:24:23,4
>>He has a phone in here


837
0:24:23,4 --> 0:24:24,23
somewhere.


838
0:24:24,23 --> 0:24:25,27
>>Why do you say that?


839
0:24:25,27 --> 0:24:26,6
>>He has an alternate AC


840
0:24:26,6 --> 0:24:30,87
adaptor.


841
0:24:30,87 --> 0:24:31,43
You can tell that it's been


842
0:24:31,43 --> 0:24:32,83
added on there.


843
0:24:32,83 --> 0:24:35,7
See where it's cut?


844
0:24:35,7 --> 0:24:37,6
So that, more than likely, fits


845
0:24:37,6 --> 0:24:39,57
a phone.


846
0:24:39,57 --> 0:24:40,17
>>How do you know it's in here


847
0:24:40,17 --> 0:24:41,2
and not on him?


848
0:24:41,2 --> 0:24:41,6
>>It could be.?


849
0:24:41,6 --> 0:24:43,9
He could have it walking around


850
0:24:43,9 --> 0:24:46,67
on the yard.


851
0:24:46,67 --> 0:24:48,7
Or it could be in here.


852
0:24:48,7 --> 0:24:50,73
Just have to find it.


853
0:24:50,73 --> 0:24:51,47
(producer) But the AC adaptor is


854
0:24:51,47 --> 0:24:52,67
contraband?


855
0:24:52,67 --> 0:24:53,47
>>Now that it's been altered.


856
0:24:53,47 --> 0:24:59,9
Yeah, it's contraband.


857
0:24:59,9 --> 0:25:0,8
When you find something like


858
0:25:0,8 --> 0:25:2,3
that, you tend to step it up a


859
0:25:2,3 --> 0:25:2,93
bit.


860
0:25:2,93 --> 0:25:6,6
Now you want to find it.


861
0:25:6,6 --> 0:25:7,57
So the next step is to go find


862
0:25:7,57 --> 0:25:9,17
him.


863
0:25:9,17 --> 0:25:9,97
Or he could have passed it off


864
0:25:9,97 --> 0:25:13,17
to one of the homeboys also.


865
0:25:13,17 --> 0:25:14,5
It's like finding a needle in


866
0:25:14,5 --> 0:25:19,3
a haystack at this point.


867
0:25:19,3 --> 0:25:20,7
Well, we got beat this time.


868
0:25:20,7 --> 0:25:21,37
Sometimes you win, sometimes you


869
0:25:21,37 --> 0:25:25,33
lose.


870
0:25:25,33 --> 0:25:26,8
>>We leave a receipt, letting


871
0:25:26,8 --> 0:25:28,43
the inmate know, these things


872
0:25:28,43 --> 0:25:31,77
have been confiscated.


873
0:25:31,77 --> 0:25:33,1
>>That's rather considerate.


874
0:25:33,1 --> 0:25:34,9
>>Oh yeah.


875
0:25:34,9 --> 0:25:36,3
Are you going to show him that


876
0:25:36,3 --> 0:25:37,2
you have the adapter?


877
0:25:37,2 --> 0:25:38,27
>>Yeah, I believe this is the


878
0:25:38,27 --> 0:25:42,17
inmate here, those two guys.


879
0:25:42,17 --> 0:25:43,27
>>That's my cellies.


880
0:25:43,27 --> 0:25:47,3
>>That's your cellies?


881
0:25:47,3 --> 0:25:47,5
OK.


882
0:25:47,5 --> 0:25:48,7
I'll leave you a receipt for


883
0:25:48,7 --> 0:25:50,1
the search.


884
0:25:50,1 --> 0:25:52,5
What I like to do is, uh, let


885
0:25:52,5 --> 0:25:54,23
the inmate know what I took.


886
0:25:54,23 --> 0:25:55,2
Why I took it.


887
0:25:55,2 --> 0:26:12,5
So that's what I did.


888
0:26:12,5 --> 0:26:13,67
(Janet) Solano State Prison is


889
0:26:13,67 --> 0:26:15,73
designed to hold 2,610


890
0:26:15,73 --> 0:26:17,5
prisoners.


891
0:26:17,5 --> 0:26:19,33
It currently holds 6,047.


892
0:26:19,33 --> 0:26:22,7
I was inside California State


893
0:26:22,7 --> 0:26:24,57
Prison Solano to investigate


894
0:26:24,57 --> 0:26:27,57
contraband in prison.


895
0:26:27,57 --> 0:26:28,8
In my search I had been


896
0:26:28,8 --> 0:26:29,93
surprised to see how many


897
0:26:29,93 --> 0:26:31,47
things the prisoners were


898
0:26:31,47 --> 0:26:33,47
allowed to have.


899
0:26:33,47 --> 0:26:35,2
We're standing in front of the


900
0:26:35,2 --> 0:26:36,3
canteen.


901
0:26:36,3 --> 0:26:37,53
This is where inmates can buy


902
0:26:37,53 --> 0:26:38,8
stuff off of a list.


903
0:26:38,8 --> 0:26:39,43
It's where money can be useful.


904
0:26:39,43 --> 0:26:40,3
So on this list you have


905
0:26:40,3 --> 0:26:41,83
everything from brown rice, to


906
0:26:41,83 --> 0:26:48,83
razors, to TV adaptors.


907
0:26:48,83 --> 0:26:50,5
Is there anything they don't


908
0:26:50,5 --> 0:26:51,17
have that you wish that they


909
0:26:51,17 --> 0:26:53,1
had?


910
0:26:53,1 --> 0:26:53,73
>>There's a lot things I wish


911
0:26:53,73 --> 0:26:56,17
they had like shrimp.


912
0:26:56,17 --> 0:26:57,5
Clams and stuff.


913
0:26:57,5 --> 0:26:58,13
But we have to get them from


914
0:26:58,13 --> 0:27:0,7
quarterly packages.


915
0:27:0,7 --> 0:27:0,87
But other than that, they have


916
0:27:0,87 --> 0:27:2,8
most of the stuff that I eat


917
0:27:2,8 --> 0:27:3,67
anyway, you know.


918
0:27:3,67 --> 0:27:6,7
Sausages, doughnuts, lollipops.


919
0:27:6,7 --> 0:27:9,83
A lot of sweets.


920
0:27:9,83 --> 0:27:10,57
I already have food from


921
0:27:10,57 --> 0:27:12,87
yesterday.


922
0:27:12,87 --> 0:27:14,77
>>You got a sweet tooth.


923
0:27:14,77 --> 0:27:15,77
>> OK, then can I please get,


924
0:27:15,77 --> 0:27:20,0
uh, ten more sausages?


925
0:27:20,0 --> 0:27:20,5
>>Ten more sausages?


926
0:27:20,5 --> 0:27:21,2
>>You're going to eat all that


927
0:27:21,2 --> 0:27:21,7
sausage by yourself?


928
0:27:21,7 --> 0:27:22,27
>>Yeah.


929
0:27:22,27 --> 0:27:22,93
I'll eat it, but over a period


930
0:27:22,93 --> 0:27:24,37
of time.


931
0:27:24,37 --> 0:27:25,37
>>The Prisoner passed out


932
0:27:25,37 --> 0:27:26,67
popsicles to his friends on the


933
0:27:26,67 --> 0:27:27,8
yard.


934
0:27:27,8 --> 0:27:28,5
At first I thought he was


935
0:27:28,5 --> 0:27:29,97
simply being nice, but I


936
0:27:29,97 --> 0:27:31,67
recalled in here, food is


937
0:27:31,67 --> 0:27:34,43
money.


938
0:27:34,43 --> 0:27:35,43
Was this a friendly gesture, or


939
0:27:35,43 --> 0:27:41,83
payback for a debt?


940
0:27:41,83 --> 0:27:42,67
I found this inmate listening


941
0:27:42,67 --> 0:27:44,87
to a walkman.


942
0:27:44,87 --> 0:27:45,87
>>Is there any stuff you wish


943
0:27:45,87 --> 0:27:47,3
you can have that you wish you


944
0:27:47,3 --> 0:27:48,37
did have?


945
0:27:48,37 --> 0:27:49,9
>>DVD players.


946
0:27:49,9 --> 0:27:51,13
>>You miss DVDs.


947
0:27:51,13 --> 0:27:51,8
>>Yeah, we don't get DVD


948
0:27:51,8 --> 0:27:53,63
players.


949
0:27:53,63 --> 0:27:54,6
Wish we had that, though.


950
0:27:54,6 --> 0:27:56,0
That'd be cool.


951
0:27:56,0 --> 0:27:57,3
I'll give it to them.


952
0:27:57,3 --> 0:27:58,37
They played "The Spirit."


953
0:27:58,37 --> 0:27:59,37
You seen "The Spirit?"


954
0:27:59,37 --> 0:28:0,1
>>Uh-uh.


955
0:28:0,1 --> 0:28:0,87
>>It's a new movie out.


956
0:28:0,87 --> 0:28:2,3
They played that on Channel 7.


957
0:28:2,3 --> 0:28:3,73
It's like a movie channel for


958
0:28:3,73 --> 0:28:5,27
the prisoners, all across the


959
0:28:5,27 --> 0:28:8,47
prisons, Channel 7.


960
0:28:8,47 --> 0:28:9,73
You know what I mean?


961
0:28:9,73 --> 0:28:10,9
>>Popcicles, dominos, walkmen.


962
0:28:10,9 --> 0:28:12,83
They had it pretty good.


963
0:28:12,83 --> 0:28:13,87
But like all things in here,


964
0:28:13,87 --> 0:28:17,0
the truth is not on the


965
0:28:17,0 --> 0:28:19,0
surface.


966
0:28:19,0 --> 0:28:20,5
[beeping]


967
0:28:20,5 --> 0:28:21,27
[woman talking on the


968
0:28:21,27 --> 0:28:26,8
loudspeaker]


969
0:28:26,8 --> 0:28:28,5
>>An alarm went


970
0:28:28,5 --> 0:28:30,7
off in one of the buildings.


971
0:28:30,7 --> 0:28:31,23
So that's why if you look


972
0:28:31,23 --> 0:28:31,93
around, everybody is seated


973
0:28:31,93 --> 0:28:36,5
right now.


974
0:28:36,5 --> 0:28:47,7
It was a false activation.


975
0:28:47,7 --> 0:28:48,33
>>I had been told that violence


976
0:28:48,33 --> 0:28:49,7
and contraband are intimately


977
0:28:49,7 --> 0:28:50,53
linked, and nearly all violence


978
0:28:50,53 --> 0:28:54,23
is sanctioned by the gangs.


979
0:28:54,23 --> 0:28:54,97
>>If you look in the yard, you


980
0:28:54,97 --> 0:28:56,3
can start to see how the


981
0:28:56,3 --> 0:28:59,93
prisons are segregated.


982
0:28:59,93 --> 0:29:1,23
In this corner, you can see the


983
0:29:1,23 --> 0:29:3,53
Southern Hispanics, on the


984
0:29:3,53 --> 0:29:5,2
other side, on the other side


985
0:29:5,2 --> 0:29:6,5
you can see the blacks and the


986
0:29:6,5 --> 0:29:7,7
Northern Hispanics and whites


987
0:29:7,7 --> 0:29:14,23
over here.


988
0:29:14,23 --> 0:29:15,57
(lead officer) If you look at


989
0:29:15,57 --> 0:29:16,17
these two gentlemen over here


990
0:29:16,17 --> 0:29:16,97
on this bench that just sat


991
0:29:16,97 --> 0:29:17,7
down with the baseball hats on.


992
0:29:17,7 --> 0:29:20,33
They're Nortenos, and that's


993
0:29:20,33 --> 0:29:22,43
where they're supposed to be


994
0:29:22,43 --> 0:29:23,7
when yard opens up.


995
0:29:23,7 --> 0:29:23,77
That's their post, that's their


996
0:29:23,77 --> 0:29:24,77
bench.


997
0:29:24,77 --> 0:29:25,4
And they stay there.


998
0:29:25,4 --> 0:29:26,53
Now the rest of the Nortenos


999
0:29:26,53 --> 0:29:27,63
will walk the yard.


1000
0:29:27,63 --> 0:29:28,87
And like Officer Sandoval said,


1001
0:29:28,87 --> 0:29:29,9
they'll count.


1002
0:29:29,9 --> 0:29:30,67
They'll count the other


1003
0:29:30,67 --> 0:29:33,87
factions out on the yard, and


1004
0:29:33,87 --> 0:29:34,43
they'll let everybody know,


1005
0:29:34,43 --> 0:29:35,13
okay, this is the number we


1006
0:29:35,13 --> 0:29:35,7
have out here on the blacks,


1007
0:29:35,7 --> 0:29:37,53
this is what we have on the


1008
0:29:37,53 --> 0:29:39,3
Surenos, on the whites, and so


1009
0:29:39,3 --> 0:29:40,7
on.


1010
0:29:40,7 --> 0:29:42,3
And then they'll adjust their


1011
0:29:42,3 --> 0:29:43,7
yard activity, and they'll post


1012
0:29:43,7 --> 0:29:45,3
up on various areas of the yard


1013
0:29:45,3 --> 0:29:46,3
and they watch for us walking


1014
0:29:46,3 --> 0:29:47,73
on the yard also and they'll


1015
0:29:47,73 --> 0:29:48,67
give little cues to each other.


1016
0:29:48,67 --> 0:29:50,5
And if they see us coming down


1017
0:29:50,5 --> 0:29:53,5
the run here he may take off


1018
0:29:53,5 --> 0:29:55,2
his hat and put it on backwards


1019
0:29:55,2 --> 0:29:56,3
he may scratch his head,


1020
0:29:56,3 --> 0:29:57,63
something to signal everybody


1021
0:29:57,63 --> 0:29:58,93
else on the yard that the


1022
0:29:58,93 --> 0:29:59,6
squads coming on the yard, and


1023
0:29:59,6 --> 0:30:1,1
all that illegal activity tends


1024
0:30:1,1 --> 0:30:2,7
to stop.


1025
0:30:2,7 --> 0:30:3,3
They don't like us out here.


1026
0:30:3,3 --> 0:30:4,1
(Janet) With so many different


1027
0:30:4,1 --> 0:30:4,9
gangs, sharing the yard at the


1028
0:30:4,9 --> 0:30:6,2
same time, violence seemed


1029
0:30:6,2 --> 0:30:7,23
inevitable.


1030
0:30:7,23 --> 0:30:8,27
Part of the ISU's job is to


1031
0:30:8,27 --> 0:30:9,3
keep prison weapons off the


1032
0:30:9,3 --> 0:30:11,97
yard.


1033
0:30:11,97 --> 0:30:12,57
>>Sandoval is probably looking


1034
0:30:12,57 --> 0:30:14,7
for weapons as we speak.


1035
0:30:14,7 --> 0:30:14,83
There he is see him over there


1036
0:30:14,83 --> 0:30:16,4
by building nine?


1037
0:30:16,4 --> 0:30:17,13
>>Oh yeah.


1038
0:30:17,13 --> 0:30:18,7
>>He's got a nose like a dog's


1039
0:30:18,7 --> 0:30:20,0
have it for drugs.


1040
0:30:20,0 --> 0:30:24,33
He's got a nose for weapons.


1041
0:30:24,33 --> 0:30:25,6
>>What do you find knives?


1042
0:30:25,6 --> 0:30:27,73
>>Oh yeah, lots of knives.


1043
0:30:27,73 --> 0:30:30,2
Usually knives in here.


1044
0:30:30,2 --> 0:30:30,5
Rods.


1045
0:30:30,5 --> 0:30:32,33
Or flat stock.


1046
0:30:32,33 --> 0:30:33,57
Sharpened up, handles ready to


1047
0:30:33,57 --> 0:30:35,8
go.


1048
0:30:35,8 --> 0:30:38,9
Look at this.


1049
0:30:38,9 --> 0:30:40,23
But if there had been something


1050
0:30:40,23 --> 0:30:41,13
there, they might have been,


1051
0:30:41,13 --> 0:30:42,27
they might have moved it


1052
0:30:42,27 --> 0:30:43,53
already.


1053
0:30:43,53 --> 0:30:44,1
(Janet) How often do you find


1054
0:30:44,1 --> 0:30:45,73
stuff out here?


1055
0:30:45,73 --> 0:30:47,33
>>Um, sometimes you'll find


1056
0:30:47,33 --> 0:30:50,83
like three or four a day,


1057
0:30:50,83 --> 0:30:51,3
you can find weapons


1058
0:30:51,3 --> 0:30:52,47
buried all over.


1059
0:30:52,47 --> 0:30:53,3
You can find them buried around


1060
0:30:53,3 --> 0:30:56,3
their exercise areas.


1061
0:30:56,3 --> 0:30:56,63
They have one guy responsible


1062
0:30:56,63 --> 0:30:57,67
for doing that.


1063
0:30:57,67 --> 0:30:59,9
To hide the weapons out here.


1064
0:30:59,9 --> 0:31:0,93
If the time comes that they


1065
0:31:0,93 --> 0:31:2,93
want to stab somebody or going


1066
0:31:2,93 --> 0:31:4,63
to use the weapon, that one


1067
0:31:4,63 --> 0:31:6,3
person will tell them, go here,


1068
0:31:6,3 --> 0:31:7,47
it's right there, go pick it


1069
0:31:7,47 --> 0:31:9,57
up, take it, and use it.


1070
0:31:9,57 --> 0:31:10,7
So if they order a guy to go


1071
0:31:10,7 --> 0:31:12,27
hit somebody, they'll tell him


1072
0:31:12,27 --> 0:31:17,37
where to go get the knife from.


1073
0:31:17,37 --> 0:31:17,97
Sometimes I get lucky sometimes


1074
0:31:17,97 --> 0:31:20,7
I don't.


1075
0:31:20,7 --> 0:31:20,57
(Janet) Prison gangs are


1076
0:31:20,57 --> 0:31:21,43
organized.


1077
0:31:21,43 --> 0:31:22,33
But they are so closely


1078
0:31:22,33 --> 0:31:24,47
monitored I wondered how they


1079
0:31:24,47 --> 0:31:25,4
taught each other their codes


1080
0:31:25,4 --> 0:31:26,6
of conduct.


1081
0:31:26,6 --> 0:31:27,17
Sgt.


1082
0:31:27,17 --> 0:31:28,5
Sandoval introduced me to


1083
0:31:28,5 --> 0:31:29,93
wheelas.


1084
0:31:29,93 --> 0:31:30,57
What do you call it?


1085
0:31:30,57 --> 0:31:31,1
Wheelas?


1086
0:31:31,1 --> 0:31:31,87
>>Wheelas.


1087
0:31:31,87 --> 0:31:33,3
They are called basement


1088
0:31:33,3 --> 0:31:34,47
filters.


1089
0:31:34,47 --> 0:31:38,1
This one is an address min.


1090
0:31:38,1 --> 0:31:41,63
Proper new arrival seating.


1091
0:31:41,63 --> 0:31:42,5
They even tell their new


1092
0:31:42,5 --> 0:31:46,37
arrival inmates, where to sit.


1093
0:31:46,37 --> 0:31:49,33
How to do an assault, to how to


1094
0:31:49,33 --> 0:31:50,57
set up weapons.


1095
0:31:50,57 --> 0:31:52,27
Everything.


1096
0:31:52,27 --> 0:31:53,27
>>Who's on their hit list,


1097
0:31:53,27 --> 0:31:54,4
who's good, who's bad, who's


1098
0:31:54,4 --> 0:31:55,93
running what yard, who's


1099
0:31:55,93 --> 0:31:57,63
running what institution.


1100
0:31:57,63 --> 0:31:59,5
>>It's...


1101
0:31:59,5 --> 0:31:59,93
what?


1102
0:31:59,93 --> 0:32:2,73
It's like eight lines of text


1103
0:32:2,73 --> 0:32:7,1
the size of my fingernail.


1104
0:32:7,1 --> 0:32:8,73
Nortenos recognize the true


1105
0:32:8,73 --> 0:32:10,3
purpose of our struggle in a


1106
0:32:10,3 --> 0:32:12,8
close knit raza, let us be the


1107
0:32:12,8 --> 0:32:15,3
enlightenment and inspiration


1108
0:32:15,3 --> 0:32:17,7
to those behind the walls and


1109
0:32:17,7 --> 0:32:19,33
stand victim to the prejudice


1110
0:32:19,33 --> 0:32:23,27
and movement of the misused.


1111
0:32:23,27 --> 0:32:24,23
It does remind me of high


1112
0:32:24,23 --> 0:32:25,57
school, when, not that I ever


1113
0:32:25,57 --> 0:32:27,4
did it, but what other students


1114
0:32:27,4 --> 0:32:29,1
would do.


1115
0:32:29,1 --> 0:32:30,2
>>Now, when they get done


1116
0:32:30,2 --> 0:32:32,13
writing this, they roll it up,


1117
0:32:32,13 --> 0:32:34,3
roll it up, roll it up until


1118
0:32:34,3 --> 0:32:35,3
they get a bindle about that


1119
0:32:35,3 --> 0:32:37,23
big around, about that long,


1120
0:32:37,23 --> 0:32:39,77
and then they hide it.


1121
0:32:39,77 --> 0:32:41,87
>>So they walk in, they go to


1122
0:32:41,87 --> 0:32:42,4
the bathroom, they pull a


1123
0:32:42,4 --> 0:32:43,6
string or whatever it is?


1124
0:32:43,6 --> 0:32:44,67
>>Or just catch it in their


1125
0:32:44,67 --> 0:32:45,37
hand.


1126
0:32:45,37 --> 0:32:46,47
>>And they pass them out?


1127
0:32:46,47 --> 0:32:47,27
>>What he'll do, he'll pass it


1128
0:32:47,27 --> 0:32:48,2
off to another guy.


1129
0:32:48,2 --> 0:32:49,2
He'll wash it off, and then the


1130
0:32:49,2 --> 0:32:50,2
other guy will wrap it in


1131
0:32:50,2 --> 0:32:52,27
another glove, or some more


1132
0:32:52,27 --> 0:32:53,37
cellophane, and he'll put it up


1133
0:32:53,37 --> 0:32:55,57
his, and so on and so on.


1134
0:32:55,57 --> 0:32:56,0
>>Oh my gosh.


1135
0:32:56,0 --> 0:32:56,6
I had not idea that there was


1136
0:32:56,6 --> 0:32:57,53
movement.


1137
0:32:57,53 --> 0:32:58,7
>>The pass it.


1138
0:32:58,7 --> 0:32:59,43
They pass it off.


1139
0:32:59,43 --> 0:33:1,83
It goes from Point A, all the


1140
0:33:1,83 --> 0:33:3,8
way to Point Z, Z being the


1141
0:33:3,8 --> 0:33:5,2
main man.


1142
0:33:5,2 --> 0:33:6,83
He collects all of that.


1143
0:33:6,83 --> 0:33:7,97
>>And a little more.


1144
0:33:7,97 --> 0:33:8,8
>>But by the time it gets to


1145
0:33:8,8 --> 0:33:9,7
him, it's been in 20 other


1146
0:33:9,7 --> 0:33:11,57
rectums.


1147
0:33:11,57 --> 0:33:15,87
Honestly.


1148
0:33:15,87 --> 0:33:17,43
Honestly.


1149
0:33:17,43 --> 0:33:17,9
It happens that way.


1150
0:33:17,9 --> 0:33:18,97
I've got thousands of these.


1151
0:33:18,97 --> 0:33:20,23
It has all their information.


1152
0:33:20,23 --> 0:33:20,8
See this.


1153
0:33:20,8 --> 0:33:22,27
How to make a weapon.


1154
0:33:22,27 --> 0:33:22,8
>>Wow.


1155
0:33:22,8 --> 0:33:23,6
>>Tells you detailed


1156
0:33:23,6 --> 0:33:24,17
instructions on how to make


1157
0:33:24,17 --> 0:33:24,87
one.


1158
0:33:24,87 --> 0:33:28,97
>>These are both instructions.


1159
0:33:28,97 --> 0:33:31,0
This is obviously some kind of


1160
0:33:31,0 --> 0:33:32,53
stabbing ...


1161
0:33:32,53 --> 0:33:51,7
It says, Final Product.


1162
0:33:51,7 --> 0:33:51,53
Wow.


1163
0:33:51,53 --> 0:33:53,53
These are bigger than the ones


1164
0:33:53,53 --> 0:33:55,63
we saw yesterday.


1165
0:33:55,63 --> 0:33:56,47
>>They have the machine that


1166
0:33:56,47 --> 0:33:57,77
cuts these.


1167
0:33:57,77 --> 0:33:58,73
Some of these guys will be up


1168
0:33:58,73 --> 0:34:0,63
there and they'll cut them, and


1169
0:34:0,63 --> 0:34:2,53
then hide them, and then throw


1170
0:34:2,53 --> 0:34:5,93
them over the fence, or


1171
0:34:5,93 --> 0:34:7,23
[keister them, and bring them


1172
0:34:7,23 --> 0:34:8,3
down the hill.


1173
0:34:8,3 --> 0:34:8,97
>>You say that if that's so


1174
0:34:8,97 --> 0:34:10,93
natural, to put a knife.


1175
0:34:10,93 --> 0:34:13,2
>>To these guys, it is.


1176
0:34:13,2 --> 0:34:14,73
>>They do that every day.


1177
0:34:14,73 --> 0:34:17,4
>>Drugs.


1178
0:34:17,4 --> 0:34:18,83
>>Cell phones.


1179
0:34:18,83 --> 0:34:20,63
>>How is that even physically


1180
0:34:20,63 --> 0:34:21,87
possible?


1181
0:34:21,87 --> 0:34:24,33
>> What he'll do is he'll wrap


1182
0:34:24,33 --> 0:34:26,73
it with a sheet.


1183
0:34:26,73 --> 0:34:27,7
When it goes up, he doesn't


1184
0:34:27,7 --> 0:34:29,2
puncture himself.


1185
0:34:29,2 --> 0:34:30,2
And we've had instances where


1186
0:34:30,2 --> 0:34:31,43
the inmate has gone to the


1187
0:34:31,43 --> 0:34:32,53
staff and said, I need to go to


1188
0:34:32,53 --> 0:34:33,97
the doctor, I'm having


1189
0:34:33,97 --> 0:34:35,2
problems.


1190
0:34:35,2 --> 0:34:35,8
Well, what's wrong?


1191
0:34:35,8 --> 0:34:37,2
I think my weapon is stuck up


1192
0:34:37,2 --> 0:34:39,77
there and I can't get it out.


1193
0:34:39,77 --> 0:34:40,33
Yeah.


1194
0:34:40,33 --> 0:34:41,63
And he'll be in pain, because


1195
0:34:41,63 --> 0:34:43,1
it punctured his intestine and


1196
0:34:43,1 --> 0:34:46,33
he couldn't get it out.


1197
0:34:46,33 --> 0:34:47,7
>> Or, you know, they walk


1198
0:34:47,7 --> 0:34:48,1
around with them, and used to


1199
0:34:48,1 --> 0:34:49,3
walking, then all of a sudden,


1200
0:34:49,3 --> 0:34:50,43
the yard has to get down, and


1201
0:34:50,43 --> 0:34:51,77
they have to get down, quick,


1202
0:34:51,77 --> 0:34:54,37
and it can puncture them that


1203
0:34:54,37 --> 0:34:54,97
way.


1204
0:34:54,97 --> 0:34:56,1
>>Right.


1205
0:34:56,1 --> 0:34:57,0
>>I had a guy tell me that he


1206
0:34:57,0 --> 0:34:58,3
needed to go to the doctor.


1207
0:34:58,3 --> 0:34:59,6
What's the matter?


1208
0:34:59,6 --> 0:35:0,87
He was in his cell, and it


1209
0:35:0,87 --> 0:35:2,33
wasn't a weapon.


1210
0:35:2,33 --> 0:35:3,6
He was just seeing how many


1211
0:35:3,6 --> 0:35:8,6
pencils he could keister.


1212
0:35:8,6 --> 0:35:10,0
Why are you doing that?


1213
0:35:10,0 --> 0:35:11,0
Well, I just want to see how


1214
0:35:11,0 --> 0:35:14,37
many I can get up there.


1215
0:35:14,37 --> 0:35:15,97
>>I was still curious.


1216
0:35:15,97 --> 0:35:17,13
Besides weapons that were made


1217
0:35:17,13 --> 0:35:18,43
on the yard, how does


1218
0:35:18,43 --> 0:35:20,6
contraband get into the prison.


1219
0:35:20,6 --> 0:35:22,3
I was told the visitors room


1220
0:35:22,3 --> 0:35:23,5
was another entry point.


1221
0:35:23,5 --> 0:35:27,83
I asked for a tour.


1222
0:35:27,83 --> 0:35:28,73
>>Hello, we're going to go


1223
0:35:28,73 --> 0:35:30,0
through the court into the


1224
0:35:30,0 --> 0:35:35,7
visiting room, OK?


1225
0:35:35,7 --> 0:35:35,93
It's really open.


1226
0:35:35,93 --> 0:35:39,23
I pictured like a glass window


1227
0:35:39,23 --> 0:35:40,37
You can give them, hand over


1228
0:35:40,37 --> 0:35:42,5
all kinds of stuff right?


1229
0:35:42,5 --> 0:35:43,63
>>Yeah?


1230
0:35:43,63 --> 0:35:45,0
>>That's why I was so confused.


1231
0:35:45,0 --> 0:35:46,33
I couldn't figure out, how are


1232
0:35:46,33 --> 0:35:48,3
visitors, how can you pass


1233
0:35:48,3 --> 0:35:49,63
things through the glass.


1234
0:35:49,63 --> 0:35:51,3
>>Contact visiting.


1235
0:35:51,3 --> 0:35:52,83
It's contact visiting, so.


1236
0:35:52,83 --> 0:35:54,63
Like say you were here visiting


1237
0:35:54,63 --> 0:35:56,43
somebody and that person, as


1238
0:35:56,43 --> 0:35:59,87
long as we have them.


1239
0:35:59,87 --> 0:36:0,9
The tables are low for a


1240
0:36:0,9 --> 0:36:2,23
reason.


1241
0:36:2,23 --> 0:36:2,83
>>Right.


1242
0:36:2,83 --> 0:36:4,33
So you can't hand anything


1243
0:36:4,33 --> 0:36:5,23
underneath.


1244
0:36:5,23 --> 0:36:6,2
>>Because if it was up here


1245
0:36:6,2 --> 0:36:7,83
then we couldn't monitor really


1246
0:36:7,83 --> 0:36:8,87
what was going on under the


1247
0:36:8,87 --> 0:36:8,9
table.


1248
0:36:8,9 --> 0:36:10,33
>>You can have up to 250 people


1249
0:36:10,33 --> 0:36:11,3
in this room, and how many


1250
0:36:11,3 --> 0:36:12,17
people would be monitoring


1251
0:36:12,17 --> 0:36:13,5
them?


1252
0:36:13,5 --> 0:36:15,1
We have two officers that are


1253
0:36:15,1 --> 0:36:17,97
on the floor.


1254
0:36:17,97 --> 0:36:19,3
Actually one is up on the


1255
0:36:19,3 --> 0:36:20,1
podium, we have a monitoring


1256
0:36:20,1 --> 0:36:23,7
system up there.


1257
0:36:23,7 --> 0:36:24,0
And one is monitoring the


1258
0:36:24,0 --> 0:36:25,37
cameras that are all over the


1259
0:36:25,37 --> 0:36:28,1
visiting room.


1260
0:36:28,1 --> 0:36:29,87
They're all over the room.


1261
0:36:29,87 --> 0:36:30,5
And an officer stays up there


1262
0:36:30,5 --> 0:36:31,43
to do that.


1263
0:36:31,43 --> 0:36:32,67
And then one is constantly


1264
0:36:32,67 --> 0:36:35,4
roving the visiting room.


1265
0:36:35,4 --> 0:36:36,0
>> What percentage gets in


1266
0:36:36,0 --> 0:36:37,53
through visitors?


1267
0:36:37,53 --> 0:36:38,73
>> Mostly what gets in through


1268
0:36:38,73 --> 0:36:41,73
visiting in going to be drugs.


1269
0:36:41,73 --> 0:36:42,73
The balloons.


1270
0:36:42,73 --> 0:36:43,7
So what I'll do, because


1271
0:36:43,7 --> 0:36:44,63
there's a lot of people in the


1272
0:36:44,63 --> 0:36:46,97
visiting room, I will open


1273
0:36:46,97 --> 0:36:50,43
this.


1274
0:36:50,43 --> 0:36:52,3
I'm over there by the machine.


1275
0:36:52,3 --> 0:36:57,2
If I came in with something


1276
0:36:57,2 --> 0:36:58,33
inserted in my body, I would go


1277
0:36:58,33 --> 0:37:0,3
into the bathroom, okay, take


1278
0:37:0,3 --> 0:37:1,77
it out, put it in my pocket,


1279
0:37:1,77 --> 0:37:3,67
and then come in here, and go


1280
0:37:3,67 --> 0:37:5,8
over here, or we've actually


1281
0:37:5,8 --> 0:37:7,3
seen it on video where they're


1282
0:37:7,3 --> 0:37:8,37
sitting here and they're kind


1283
0:37:8,37 --> 0:37:9,83
of like this and they'll take


1284
0:37:9,83 --> 0:37:11,13
it out of their pocket and drop


1285
0:37:11,13 --> 0:37:11,77
it in here.


1286
0:37:11,77 --> 0:37:12,93
OK?


1287
0:37:12,93 --> 0:37:15,87
And then I hand it to you, and


1288
0:37:15,87 --> 0:37:16,5
as you're eating your chips,


1289
0:37:16,5 --> 0:37:19,4
OK, you'll eat a couple of


1290
0:37:19,4 --> 0:37:19,87
chips, and then you'll go like


1291
0:37:19,87 --> 0:37:20,73
this, and then you'll start


1292
0:37:20,73 --> 0:37:21,5
putting balloons in there and


1293
0:37:21,5 --> 0:37:22,63
swallowing them.


1294
0:37:22,63 --> 0:37:24,1
Not too many cell phones,


1295
0:37:24,1 --> 0:37:27,63
because they're harder to get


1296
0:37:27,63 --> 0:37:30,3
from here, from wherever she


1297
0:37:30,3 --> 0:37:30,93
has it into here, into ...


1298
0:37:30,93 --> 0:37:32,23
Because it's easier to insert


1299
0:37:32,23 --> 0:37:34,13
rectally than it is to swallow.


1300
0:37:34,13 --> 0:37:35,43
But we've actually had inmates


1301
0:37:35,43 --> 0:37:36,33
that will actually take


1302
0:37:36,33 --> 0:37:37,2
something out of here if it's


1303
0:37:37,2 --> 0:37:38,43
too big to swallow, and they'll


1304
0:37:38,43 --> 0:37:39,77
actually kind of go like this


1305
0:37:39,77 --> 0:37:41,57
and sit there and the next


1306
0:37:41,57 --> 0:37:42,7
thing you know and then on the


1307
0:37:42,7 --> 0:37:45,57
video you see them go "oop!"


1308
0:37:45,57 --> 0:37:54,3
well, we know what that is.


1309
0:37:54,3 --> 0:37:57,37
Day three without a cell phone.


1310
0:37:57,37 --> 0:38:0,67
All right ready to go.


1311
0:38:0,67 --> 0:38:1,67
>>For the first time, Solano


1312
0:38:1,67 --> 0:38:3,3
State prison was allowing a


1313
0:38:3,3 --> 0:38:4,7
documentary crew to film its


1314
0:38:4,7 --> 0:38:5,6

1315
0:38:5,6 --> 0:38:7,13
contraband.


1316
0:38:7,13 --> 0:38:8,53
So far they had found a cell


1317
0:38:8,53 --> 0:38:9,97
phone charger, but no phones.


1318
0:38:9,97 --> 0:38:11,2
The prisoners were skilled at


1319
0:38:11,2 --> 0:38:15,53
keeping their valuables hidden.


1320
0:38:15,53 --> 0:38:16,13

1322
0:38:16,97 --> 0:38:17,8
newest weapon.


1323
0:38:17,8 --> 0:38:18,97
Meet Caesar, the cell phone


1324
0:38:18,97 --> 0:38:22,6
sniffing dog.


1325
0:38:22,6 --> 0:38:23,53
Is he friendly?


1326
0:38:23,53 --> 0:38:24,17
Very friendly, he's not an


1327
0:38:24,17 --> 0:38:25,17
attack ranger, very friendly.


1328
0:38:25,17 --> 0:38:29,17
>>Hi!


1329
0:38:29,17 --> 0:38:29,8
Oh you gave me a kiss.


1330
0:38:29,8 --> 0:38:30,47
This early in the morning.


1331
0:38:30,47 --> 0:38:33,6
Hi!


1332
0:38:33,6 --> 0:38:34,3
Sweetie.


1333
0:38:34,3 --> 0:38:35,43
>>Do you want to play ballie?


1334
0:38:35,43 --> 0:38:37,87
Want your ball?

1336
0:38:38,63 --> 0:38:40,47

1338
0:38:42,67 --> 0:38:49,93
>>Go find it.


1339
0:38:49,93 --> 0:38:53,5
What's in there?


1340
0:38:53,5 --> 0:38:57,4
See the cell phone?


1341
0:38:57,4 --> 0:38:59,83
On the bottom.


1342
0:38:59,83 --> 0:39:2,13
>>Oh yeah.


1343
0:39:2,13 --> 0:39:4,97
>>Oh yeah, that's a good boy.


1344
0:39:4,97 --> 0:39:5,43
What do we got in there, we got


1345
0:39:5,43 --> 0:39:6,5
something?


1346
0:39:6,5 --> 0:39:7,0
>>So he thinks he's looking for


1347
0:39:7,0 --> 0:39:8,53
that toy?


1348
0:39:8,53 --> 0:39:10,77
>>Just a piece of canvas.


1349
0:39:10,77 --> 0:39:11,73
Just his toy.


1350
0:39:11,73 --> 0:39:12,4
That's all it is.


1351
0:39:12,4 --> 0:39:13,0
>>And he thinks he's looking


1352
0:39:13,0 --> 0:39:13,7
for that?


1353
0:39:13,7 --> 0:39:14,4
>>Yeah.


1354
0:39:14,4 --> 0:39:14,97
>>So what do you do?


1355
0:39:14,97 --> 0:39:16,37
Rub a bunch of cellphones onto


1356
0:39:16,37 --> 0:39:16,93
the toy?


1357
0:39:16,93 --> 0:39:17,93
>>Actually what we do is take


1358
0:39:17,93 --> 0:39:19,47
it in its beginning of it's


1359
0:39:19,47 --> 0:39:20,67
called transfer odor.


1360
0:39:20,67 --> 0:39:22,13
I'll take a big glass jar and


1361
0:39:22,13 --> 0:39:25,8
what I'll do is I'll take rags


1362
0:39:25,8 --> 0:39:27,87
and we permeate the odor into


1363
0:39:27,87 --> 0:39:30,3
them, roll em up, like this.


1364
0:39:30,3 --> 0:39:32,1
And just play throw toys.


1365
0:39:32,1 --> 0:39:33,37
And what we'll do is transfer


1366
0:39:33,37 --> 0:39:35,17
that odor into the real


1367
0:39:35,17 --> 0:39:36,2
substance.


1368
0:39:36,2 --> 0:39:36,83
In other words when I'm


1369
0:39:36,83 --> 0:39:38,3
searching I'll put his toy say


1370
0:39:38,3 --> 0:39:43,3
over here in a stack of boxes


1371
0:39:43,3 --> 0:39:44,6
and then a foot away I'll put


1372
0:39:44,6 --> 0:39:46,37
the substance we're looking


1373
0:39:46,37 --> 0:39:48,7
for.


1374
0:39:48,7 --> 0:39:49,27
And as he comes across he'll


1375
0:39:49,27 --> 0:39:50,1
hit on that, and then hit on


1376
0:39:50,1 --> 0:39:50,93
the real thing.


1377
0:39:50,93 --> 0:39:51,63
>>Got it.


1378
0:39:51,63 --> 0:39:53,6
>>Is there another one?


1379
0:39:53,6 --> 0:39:59,4
Let's go find it.


1380
0:39:59,4 --> 0:40:2,3
What you got in there?


1381
0:40:2,3 --> 0:40:3,57
What you got in there?


1382
0:40:3,57 --> 0:40:4,17
What you got?


1383
0:40:4,17 --> 0:40:5,5
You got something?


1384
0:40:5,5 --> 0:40:7,7
Get it out of there!


1385
0:40:7,7 --> 0:40:8,63
Get it out of there!


1386
0:40:8,63 --> 0:40:13,37
There you go!


1387
0:40:13,37 --> 0:40:16,37
Let's see what you got.


1388
0:40:16,37 --> 0:40:17,17
(Janet) I was impressed by


1389
0:40:17,17 --> 0:40:17,97
Caesar.


1390
0:40:17,97 --> 0:40:18,73
And I wanted to see him in


1391
0:40:18,73 --> 0:40:19,87
action.


1392
0:40:19,87 --> 0:40:21,17
I joined the ISU for a random


1393
0:40:21,17 --> 0:40:23,1
cell phone sweep.


1394
0:40:23,1 --> 0:40:24,3
>> As soon as we hit the yard,


1395
0:40:24,3 --> 0:40:24,77
We've got to move right to


1396
0:40:24,77 --> 0:40:25,2
the building.


1397
0:40:25,2 --> 0:40:25,9
We can't stop.


1398
0:40:25,9 --> 0:40:27,47
We've got to go right there.


1399
0:40:27,47 --> 0:40:28,13
Because as soon as we hit the


1400
0:40:28,13 --> 0:40:29,0
yard all the


1401
0:40:29,0 --> 0:40:30,23
signals are going to go


1402
0:40:30,23 --> 0:40:30,8
up and everyone's going to


1403
0:40:30,8 --> 0:40:31,67
start getting alerted.


1404
0:40:31,67 --> 0:40:32,67
>>Sure.


1405
0:40:32,67 --> 0:40:33,3
I'll just follow you.


1406
0:40:33,3 --> 0:40:43,53
>>Just keep up.


1407
0:40:43,53 --> 0:40:44,6
(Janet) As soon as we hit the


1408
0:40:44,6 --> 0:40:45,73
yard the inmates began warning


1409
0:40:45,73 --> 0:40:48,67

1410
0:40:48,67 --> 0:40:53,67
all the woof woofs, they see


1411
0:40:53,67 --> 0:40:56,93
the dog coming.


1412
0:40:56,93 --> 0:40:58,3
>>There's the whistles.


1413
0:40:58,3 --> 0:40:58,87
>>Yeah, you hear the whistles.


1414
0:40:58,87 --> 0:40:59,93
The inmates alerting each other


1415
0:40:59,93 --> 0:41:8,7

1416
0:41:8,7 --> 0:41:9,6
>>And now you start hearing the


1417
0:41:9,6 --> 0:41:10,8
toilets flushing.


1418
0:41:10,8 --> 0:41:11,6
It is difficult to hear on


1419
0:41:11,6 --> 0:41:13,1

1420
