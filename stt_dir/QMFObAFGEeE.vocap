###18 I HAVE
###25 DURING LECTURE. SO, PLEASE
###31  UP FOR THE BOOK CLUB, I SEEM TO HAVE THE EMAIL WRONG,
###35 COULD SEE ME AFTER, I HAVE
###44 
###48 READING FOR THIS WEEK
###55 PHOTOCOPY IF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET THE
###60 NOT TOO LATE. I
###64 AT IT. VERY COOL STUFF.
###73 GSI'S POINTED OUT ME THAT I MADE A
###80 I
###86 THAT FIGURE WAS RIGHT. THE
###92 
###103 SO IN THE LAST LECTURE
###110 THE BRINGING TOGETHER THE PRINCIPLES OF EVOLUTION FOR
###114 OF INHERITANCE,
###124 AND GENETIC MATERIALS, GENOMES AND SO ON.
###129 AND
###137 DISCOVERIES LIKE GENOME
###143 
###150 HAVEN'T CHANGED. SO
###155 US UNDERSTAND DETAILS OF THE NATURAL WORLD.
###163 THINGY. ALL
###175 IS, THE DYNAMICS OF GENETIC VARIATION
###181 
###186 IN THE POPULATION SHOULD
###193 SO YOUR FAVORITE THING, P SQUARED 2PQ AND
###203 OF THAT.
###212 THE FREQUENCY OF HETEROZYGOTES FOR
###226 TO TOUCH ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK I
###232 
###238 AND MUTATION AND SEE WHAT
###245 
###253 OVER B, THESE ARE
###261 THE RECESSIVE PHENOTYPE. THINK ABOUT THE
###269 FREQUENCY ON
###280 OF THIS HOMOZYGOTE, WE EXPECT
###285 OF THIS PHENOTYPE IS QÓ. SO THAT GIVES US A
###299 ALLELE GIVEN THE
###307 B PHENOTYPE IS QÓ, THEN THE FREQUENCY
###318 FREQUENCY OF
###333 Q. JUST TWO ALLELES. THIS
###339 BUT I AM JUST DOING THE TWO ALLELE SITUATIONS.
###344 ESTIMATE OF P.
###359 GENOTYPES ARE IN THE
###369 THIS. OKAY? SO THEN, ARE YOU
###378 
###386 CYSTIC FIBROSIS.
###396 THE FREQUENCY OF INDIVIDUALS WHO DISPLAY THAT
###414 
###430 AN ESTIMATE OF THE
###433 IT IS RECESSIVE. 0.02 TIMES .98 TIMES
###451 POPULATION. 1 IN 25 OR 1 IN
###460 STATE BUT DON'T EXPRESS IT BECAUSE IT
###467 A BIT
###475 HERE THIS FOLLOWS
###484 MORE COMMON IN HETEROZYGOTES THAN IT
###493 MOSTLY
###508 THIS BECOMES IMPORTANT IN
###513  WE WILL COME BACK TO.
###521 SO FOR RARE ALLELES, THAT IS, Q, THE FREQUENCY
###539 QÓ IS MUCH
###554 STATE. THE FACT THAT WE CAN DO A LITTLE
###563 
###574 OF THE A ALLELE, FROM
###585 HOMOZYGOTE IS QÓ. LOOKS LIKE THIS IN TERMS OF
###598 IN THE ALLELE
###611 OF A RARE ALLELE AT 0.1. SOMEWHERE
###621 
###633 0.18. THIS IS
###645 IN PARTICULAR THE POPULATION IS RANDOM
###653 IN THE
###659 GO ON. ARE YOU WITH ME?
###681 THE OTHER WAY AROUND. SO, IT IS THE SAME
###688 CALL THIS PÓ.
###694 THING, ONE JUST RECIPROCAL OF THE OTHER.
###704 SO IN THINKING
###709 WHICH WAS LARGE POPULATION SIZE.
###716 THE
###721 THE ALLELE FREQUENCY. SO, NOW
###729 
###750 FOR A MOMENT AND THINK
###758 TOWARDS A REALLY BIG HIKE IN TUITION FEES.
###766 CLASS AND ASK
###771 EXAMPLE. MAYBE I WILL PICK SOME
###776 
###781 THE ENTIRE 1B CLASS I WILL
###787  OPINION OF THAT SUBJECT. SAME WITH VOTING. DO YOU
###793 YOU HAVE
###799 SURVEYED THAN IF 100 PEOPLE WERE
###806  POPULATION AND OF THE OVERALL VOTING INTENT. SO, THE
###812 GAMETES TO FORM
###830 WE ARE GOING TO SAMPLE OUT OF EACH OF THESE
###841 THE ZYGOTE.
###849 WE WILL GET A MORE ACCURATE
###858  POPULATION OF THE VARIATION IF WE TAKE A BIG EXAMPLE
###862 IF YOU TAKE A SMALL
###870 GOING ON TO ADULTS IN THE NEXT GENERATION
###876 OF THE
###889 FREQUENCIES FROM ONE
###898 AND THE SMALLER THE POPULATION THE BIGGER THE
###903 FLUCTUATIONS
###912 WHAT THIS MIGHT DO IN A POPULATION OF
###918 ONES AND
###924 TO THE NEXT TAKING A VERY SMALL
###931 
###935 HARDY WEINBERG PREDICTS NO
###942 FREQUENCIES. BUT, IN A VERY SMALL POPULATION
###947 SO YOU GET THESE
###963 
###972 SAMPLE. YEAH. MY
###981 IT IS THE POPULATION ITSELF THAT IS SMALL.
###987 RANDOM CHANGES
###998 FREQUENCY
###1011 GET SOME FLUCTUATION. MAYBE EVEN TO
###1019 IN THE
###1026 TO SAMPLE THE OTHER
###1032 OF FORMING THE DIPLOIDS OR THE ZYGOTES.
###1039 VERY
###1052 THE AMPLITUDE IS MUCH
###1068 WHY DOES THIS MATTER? IT MATTERS IN
###1075 
###1086 SIZE, WHICH I WILL
###1102 SIZE IS ALWAYS SMALL.
###1110 HAVE A SITUATION WHERE YOU START WITH
###1117 SOME REASON.
###1127 BIOLOGY, LOSS OF HABITAT OR
###1135 POPULATIONS. SO, ONE EXAMPLE IS FROM HABITAT
###1153 CHICKENS
###1160 POPULATIONS, VAST AREAS OF
###1166 TO EXPANSION OF INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE. THERE IS VERY
###1173 AND THE PRAIRIE
###1179 THEY HAVE LOST GENETIC VARIATIONS. WE
###1183 
###1189 MEASURE GENETIC VARIATION NOW
###1194 BECAUSE OF THIS SAMPLING EFFECT, LOSING
###1202 CAN ONLY
###1207 IS A VERY RARE EVENT. AS
###1216 
###1223 FORGOTTEN WHAT THE
###1230 THE REPRODUCTION AND SURVIVAL OF THE PRAIRIE
###1237 THEY MIX
###1244 HATCH RIGHT OF THE POPULATION. WHICH
###1253 DRIFT
###1257 NEXT. THAT IS A RANDOM PROCESS.
###1267 FOR TEN YEARS. DO I STILL NOT HAVE IT? LIKE
###1274 A VALLEY
###1284 2. IN POPULATION 1, IF THIS IS THE
###1295 
###1302 DIRECTION TO THE
###1308  HERE YOU LOST VARIATION. BUT YOU HAVE GOT DIFFERENT
###1316 THESE ARE ALL A.
###1326 WILL COME BACK TO THIS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT
###1330 ARE COMING UP
###1337 IN SMALL POPULATIONS. IT CAUSES RANDOM
###1345 TO THE
###1350 ENOUGH, IT WILL LEAD TO THE
###1356 INCREASE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN POPULATIONS, IF THE
###1365 ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHERE THIS IS IMPORTANT, THAT IS
###1371 ANOTHER EXAMPLE
###1383 HUMAN SPECIES, HOMOSAPIANS, AROSE
###1390 
###1398 SOUTH ASIA INTO AUSTRALIA
###1404 
###1411 AFRICANS THAN THERE IS
###1418 DIVERSITY WITH THAT NATURAL COLONIZATION. THE
###1424 COMING OUT OF
###1438 THEY STEM FROM A SINGLE ANCESTOR OR
###1444 
###1452 ISLANDS IS THAT THERE IS A LOT
###1456 PHENOTYPES AND IN GENETIC VARIATION. PERHAPS
###1461 
###1476 TO THIS
###1484 RAPID CHANGES IN THE GENETIC
###1489 
###1498 OR NOT.
###1515 DRIFT? THE SAMPLING
###1516 ONE THAT TURNS OUT NOT
###1517  IS A MUTATION. SO, LET'S LOOK AT THE PROCESS OF
###1520 I CAN BE. SO
###1520 NOT TAKEN ANY MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AT
###1521 
###1521 SO I WANT TO TALK NOW ABOUT MUTATION. ARE YOU ALL OKAY WITH
###1521 GENETIC DRIFT? THE SAMPLING THE PROCESS? OKAY. ANY QUESTIONS?
###1522 SO, ANOTHER ASSUMPTION OF HOW THEY, ONE THAT TURNS OUT NOT TO
###1526 MATTER VERY MUCH IN THE CONTEXT OF HARDY-WEINBURG IS MUTATION.
###1532 SO LET'S LOOK AT THE PROCESS OF MUTATION.
###1536 HERE AGAIN I'LL NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW GENTLE I CAN BE. IF
###1546 I TAKE THIS SMALLISH SAMPLE OF THE TOTAL CLASS, HOW MANY PEOPLE
###1551 HAVE TAKEN ANY MOLECULAR -- HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE NOT TAKEN ANY
###1554 MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AT ANY STAGE? OKAY. I'LL BE GENTLE.
###1561 I'M SURE YOU HAVE THAT PLEASURE AHEAD OF YOU. SO LET'S LOOK
###1567 AT MUTATION.
###1574 MUTATION, THAT IS, CHANGES IN THE GENOME OR THE
###1578 NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCE. IT IS SORT OF THE ULTIMATE SOURCE OF
###1587 VARIATION. WITH THAT MUTATION ALL GENES IN THE POPULATION WOULD
###1595 JUST HAVE THE SAME SET OF ALLELES. YOU ARE GOING TO GENERATE NEW
###1600 VARIANCES OF ALLELES. AND THAT PROCESS THAT GENERATES THAT IS
###1604 MUTATION.
###1609 SO, IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT SLIDE FIVE AND SUMMARIZE SOME OF
###1613 THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF MUTATION THAT CAN OCCUR AT THE LEVEL OF
###1618 GENES OR THEIR CONTROLLING ELEMENTS.
###1620 SO ONE TYPE OF MUTATION THAT CAN OCCUR IS A CHANGE IN THE
###1627 CODING SEQUENCE.
###1637 WHAT DO I MEAN BY CODING SEQUENCE?
###1638 SO EUKARYOTES IN GENERAL, A SORT OF CARTOON FORM. A GENE
###1652 MIGHT BE STRUCTURED SOMETHING LIKE THIS. WE HAVE EXONS AND THE
###1665 INTRONS. IT'S THE EXONS, THE WHOLE THING IS TRANSCRIBED IN THE
###1675 MESSENGER RNA AND THEN THE INTRONS ARE CUT OUT. WHAT YOU
###1682 
###1691 THE INTRONS ARE CUT OUT. SO THE MESSENGER RNA REPRESENTS WHAT'S
###1696 IN THE EXONS. THIS THEN GOES THROUGH TRANSLATION TO FORM THE
###1704 PROTEIN.
###1712 ELSEWHERE, YOU MIGHT HAVE AND THAT COULD BE QUITE DISTANT
###1717 FROM THIS GENE, YOU'LL HAVE SEQUENCES THAT CONTROL GENE
###1723 REGULATION.
###1729 PLAYS WITH THE ENZYMES THAT TRANSCRIBE THE DNA AND
###1732 THOSE COMPLEXES WILL BIND TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH, WHERE AND WHEN
###1738 THIS PARTICULAR GENE IS EXPRESSED. THAT IS, TRANSCRIBED AND
###1741 TRANSLATED TO MESSENGER RNA. THERE IS A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON AS
###1745 WELL, BUT THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW FOR NOW.
###1748 SO WITHIN THESE EXONS, YOU BLOW THIS UP. YOU GET A SEQUENCE
###1756 OF NUCLEOTIDES WHICH COME IN THREE'S, WHICH ARE CALLED CODONS.
###1767 AND THESE FORM THE PARTICULAR CODE. PARTICULAR CODONS SPECIFY
###1770 PARTICULAR AMINO ACIDS IN THE PROTEIN. OKAY. YOU ALL WITH ME ON
###1776 THAT? A LOT OF REALLY COOL STUFF GOING ON BESIDE THIS BUT THAT
###1780 WILL DO FOR NOW.
###1782 WHEN I REFER TO A CHANGE IN THE CODING SEQUENCE, I'M
###1786 REFERRING TO A CHANGE IN THE EXONS AND ONE IN WHICH PERHAPS
###1790 CHANGES WHICH AMINO ACID IS ENCODED IN THAT PROTEIN THAT'S
###1795 PRODUCED. AN EXAMPLE SHOWN THERE IS FOR THE HEMOGLOBIN OR THE
###1800 BETA-GLOBIN GENE IN HEMOGLOBIN. IN THAT SLIDE REMEMBER WE TALKED
###1805 ABOUT HEMOGLOBIN A AND B? HBBA, HBBS, IN THE LAST LECTURE THE
###1812 SICKLE CELL MUTATION. THAT'S DUE TO A CHANGE IN THE CODING
###1818 SEQUENCE FROM, IN A PARTICULAR CODON FROM CCT TO CAT. YOU'VE
###1828 
###1837 AMINO ACID CODE IN THAT PROTEIN WHICH GIVES RISE TO THE DISTINCT
###1843 PHENOTYPE. THAT IS A CHANGE IN A CODING SEQUENCE.
###1849 YOU CAN ALSO CHANGE REGULATORY SEQUENCES. SO THIS STUFF.
###1859 IT IS A MUTATION THAT'S GOING TO OCCUR IN THE DNA THERE THAT WILL
###1866 CHANGE THE EXTENT, THE TIMING OR THE PLACE OF GENE EXPRESSION,
###1872 WHICH CAN MATTER A WHOLE LOT.
###1878 OKAY? SO IN HEMOGLOBIN, FOR EXAMPLE, DIFFERENT GLOBIN GENES
###1885 ARE EXPRESSED AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. THEY ARE
###1889 EXPRESSED IN PARTICULAR TISSUES TO FORM THE HEMOGLOBIN, ET
###1892 CETERA, ET CETERA.
###1901 WE CAN ALSO CHANGE THE NUMBER OF COPIES OF GENES IN THE
###1904 GENOME. WE ARE JUST NOW STARTING TO SEE HOW VERY COMMON THIS IS.
###1908 SO THESE ARE SO-CALLED COPY NUMBER VARIANCE. SO GENES CAN
###1922 BE -- EXTRA COPIES CAN BE MADE OF GENES THROUGH ERRORS IN
###1926 REPLICATION OR ERRORS IN RECOMBINATION OR BY MOBILE ELEMENTS
###1933 TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS. A WHOLE VARIETY OF MECHANISMS. YOU CAN
###1936 CHANGE THE NUMBER OF COPIES OF GENES. THAT AGAIN CAN EFFECT THE
###1940 PHENOTYPE. THE FACT THAT IT'S TURNING OUT TO BE QUITE A COMMON
###1944 CAUSE OF DIFFERENCES IN A WHOLE NUMBER OF HUMAN TRAITS, DISEASES
###1950 AND SO FORTH. CHANGES IN THE COPY NUMBER OF GENES, NOT THEIR
###1953 INTERNAL STRUCTURE. AND PARTICULAR PARTS OF GENOME DO THIS A
###1956 WHOLE LOT AND OTHER PARTS ARE ALL STABLE. IT IS SOMETHING THAT
###1961 ONLY NOW THEY ARE ABLE TO ASSESS ACCURATELY IN HUMAN POPULATIONS.
###1965 AND FINALLY YOU CAN CHANGE GENOME ORGANIZATION. MAYBE EVEN
###1979 
###1990 YOU CAN CREATE POLYPLOIDS. SO DIPLOID TO TETRAPLOID. COPY THE
###1997 WHOLE GENOME. AND THIS HAS HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES IN CERTAINLY
###2003 THE EVOLUTION OF VERTEBRATES AND OTHER ORGANISMS. IN FACT, IN
###2008 INDIVIDUAL SALMONA CELLS YOU GET DIFFERENT PLOIDY LEVELS. FOR
###2014 THE WHOLE SALMON FAMILY IN GENERAL THEY HAVE COPIED THEIR WHOLE
###2018 GENOME AND THEN GENES HAVE DIVERSIFIED AMONG THOSE COPIES.
###2023 OKAY. SO THESE -- OR YOU CAN CHANGE THE ORGANIZATION OF
###2030 CHROMOSOMES, YOU CAN FUSE CHROMOSOMES TOGETHER OR BITS CAN BREAK
###2033 OFF AND JOIN ANOTHER CHROMOSOME. SO ALL THESE ARE FORMS OF
###2037 MUTATION THAT ARISE MOSTLY THROUGH ERRORS IN REPLICATION,
###2042 RECOMBINATION OR THE ACTION OF TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS OR MOBILE
###2047 ELEMENTS IN THE GENOME.
###2057 HOW COMMON IS THIS? WELL, PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO FIGURE THIS
###2060 OUT FOR A LONG TIME. WHAT'S THE FREQUENCY OF MUTATION? SO JUST
###2079 RECENTLY A FEW WEEKS AGO THERE WAS A REPORT OF COMPLETE GENOME
###2082 SEQUENCING OF MULTIPLE FAMILIES. BOTH PARENTS, BIOLOGICAL
###2086 PARENTS, OF COURSE, AND THEIR OFFSPRING, AND I DID THIS FOR THE
###2090 WHOLE FAMILIES. SO I COMPARED THE WHOLE GENOME BETWEEN PARENTS
###2094 AND OFFSPRING TO IDENTIFY CHANGES, ALLELES IN THE OFFSPRING BUT
###2099 NOT THE PARENTS. THE CONCLUSION FROM THAT IS THAT THE MUTATION
###2106 RATE IS ROUGHLY 10 TO THE MINUS 8 PER NUCLEOTIDE PER GENERATION.
###2118 10 TO THE MINUS 8 IS A TINY LITTLE NUMBER. ONE IN 100 MILLION.
###2128 BUT THINK ABOUT HOW MANY NUCLEOTIDES YOU HAVE IN YOUR GENOME.
###2133 THE GENOME IS APPROXIMATELY 3 BY 10 TO THE 9 BASE PAIRS IN
###2145 
###2151 GENERATION. HERE'S THE NUMBER OF NUCLEOTIDES. SO THE NUMBER OF
###2158 NEW MUTATIONS ACROSS THE WHOLE GENOME IN A PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL
###2165 CAN BE ROUGHLY 30. EACH OF US IS A MUTANT. AND WE SHOULD
###2175 CELEBRATE THAT. IT IS THE ULTIMATE CAUSE OF HUMAN DIVERSITY.
###2182 SO, ON AVERAGE THERE IS A LOT OF VARIATION IN THIS NUMBER.
###2184 YOU ARE GOING TO CARRY SOME TENS OF CHANGES IN YOUR DNA SEQUENCE
###2190 COMPARED TO YOUR PARENTS. I THINK THAT'S COOL. NOW, DO THESE
###2196 MATTER? MOST OF THE GENOME ISN'T IN THESE BITS. MOST OF IT'S IN
###2204 THE CHUNKS OF DNA BETWEEN GENES. NOW, SOME OF THIS MATTERS IN
###2208 WAYS WE DON'T YET UNDERSTAND. PERHAPS IN GENE REGULATION, SO AND
###2214 SO FORTH. SO MOST OF THESE CHANGES PROBABLY AREN'T LANDING IN
###2220 EXON OR IN ARTIFACT GENE REGULATION BUT SOME DO. SOME SMALL
###2228 PROPORTION OF THOSE WILL. SO, WHY DO WE ALL HAVE TEN
###2235 FINGERS -- SORRY. 11 FINGERS? SO ON AND SO FORTH. THESE ARE
###2242 MOSTLY HETEROZYGOTES. WE'RE NEARLY ALL HETEROZYGOTES. BECAUSE
###2245 IT'S A UNIQUE MUTATION. IT IS LANDING RANDOM SOMEWHERE IN THIS
###2249 WHOPPING BIG GENOME. SO THE CHANCE OF THAT SAME MUTATION
###2255 OCCURRING WHEN YOUR MOM MADE THE EGGS AND YOUR DAD MADE THE SPERM
###2259 HITTING THE SAME PLACE IS VANISHINGLY SMALL. SO THESE ARE
###2267 ESSENTIALLY ORGAN B HETEROZYGOTES AND MOSTLY RECESSIVE. THAT IS,
###2276 PARTICULARLY IF IT'S A MUTATION THAT KNOCKS OUT A FUNCTION. OR A
###2279 LOT OF TIMES WHEN YOU HAVE ONE OR THE OTHER COPIED AND IT IS
###2281 FUNCTIONAL, YOU'RE OKAY.
###2292 SO, ALTHOUGH WE ALL CARRY MUTATIONS, WE STILL FUNCTION
###2295 
###2304 WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU MATE WITH A CLOSE RELATIVE? INBREEDING.
###2312 RIGHT? MATING WITH CLOSE RELATIVES WITHIN FAMILIES CAN BRING
###2319 THESE OTHERWISE RARE MUTATIONS TOGETHER. IF THE SAME MUTATION
###2324 HAPPENS TO BE SHARED ACROSS GENERATIONS BECAUSE THESE WILL
###2327 ACCUMULATE ACROSS GENERATIONS, AND YOU'RE MATING WITH A BROTHER,
###2334 SISTER OR FATHER OR WHATEVER, THEN YOU MIGHT BRING THESE,
###2340 OTHERWISE, VERY RARE MUTATIONS TOGETHER IN THE SAME OFFSPRING,
###2343 WHICH IS BAD.
###2347 BECAUSE THEN THEY'RE EXPRESSED. THEIR HOMOZYGOUS AND IF IT
###2351 IS A KNOCKOUT MUTATION OR SOMETHING THAT CAUSES DAMAGE TO THE
###2355 PHENOTYPE, IT WON'T BE REAL GOOD. SO, JUST DON'T INBREED IS MY
###2362 ADVISE. TURNS OUT DARWIN MARRIED HIS COUSIN, WHICH IS REALLY
###2367 COMMON IN VICTORIAN ENGLAND. AND SOME SOCIETIES DO PRACTICE IN
###2371 BREEDING. BUT THERE IT IS. THAT IS WHY IN PART INBREEDING IS
###2378 SUCH A BAD THING.
###2378 OKAY. SO, IN SLIDE 6 I SHOW YOU AN EXAMPLE OF THESE
###2388 DIFFERENT FORMS OF MUTATION THAT ACTUALLY RELATES TO CODE COLOR
###2391 IN MICE, WHICH YOU WILL BE STUDYING IN THE LAB. SO ON THE LEFT
###2396 IS A NORMAL SORT OF MOUSE. ON THE RIGHT IS A DARK MOUSE, IN
###2402 SLIDE 6.
###2405 SO TURNS OUT THESE MUTATIONS CAN ARISE THIS PARTICULAR
###2408 PHENOTYPE WHICH TURNS UP AGAIN AND AGAIN ON LAVA FLOWS. THE NEXT
###2412 LECTURE I WILL BRING YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF THESE ANIMALS. YES?
###2423 YES. EXACTLY. SO WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS. SO IF THE
###2427 
###2432 REPRODUCTION, THEN IT WILL BE FAVORED BY SELECTION AND IT WILL
###2435 INCREASE IN THE POPULATION. OKAY? THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.
###2444 YES, BUT IT TAKES MUCH LONGER. WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT
###2446 THAT IN THE LECTURE ON FRIDAY. NEW MUTATIONS COME IN. THEY MAY
###2450 HAVE NO EFFECT ON THE PHENOTYPE BECAUSE THERE IS SOME IN THE DNA
###2455 THAT LITERALLY HAS NO EFFECT. BUT MIGHT HAVE AN EFFECT BUT BE
###2460 RECESSIVE AND MIGHT HAVE AN EFFECT AND BE DOMINANT. AND THAT
###2465 REALLY CHANGES HOW THE WHOLE DYNAMIC GOES FROM THERE IN TERMS OF
###2469 WHETHER IT'S FAVORED BY SELECTION. MAYBE LOST BY GENETIC DRIFT.
###2472 REMEMBER IT WAS A DRIFT THING. IF YOU START DOWN HERE AT A VERY
###2478 LOW ALLELE FREQUENCY, A NEW MUTATION, THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE THAT
###2482 WILL ACTUALLY BE LOST. UNDER GENETIC DRIFT GOING INTO THE NEXT
###2487 GENERATION YOU WILL FAIL TO PICK UP THAT EXCEPTIONALLY RARE
###2489 MUTATION IN AN OFFSPRING IN THE NEXT GENERATION IN SORT OF MODEL
###2493 SIZE POPULATIONS. SO IT IS REALLY INTERESTING TO THINK ABOUT
###2498 WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE FATE OF THIS MUTATION. A LOT OF TIMES
###2500 THEY WILL JUST BE LOST. WE'LL FAIL TO GET THEM IN THE NEXT
###2504 GENERATION. IF THEY ARE FAVORED BY SELECTION THEN HOW QUICKLY
###2508 THEY INCREASE WILL DEPEND ON WHETHER THEY ARE RECESSIVE OR NOT.
###2513 AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT. THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION. ANY OTHER
###2516 QUESTIONS?
###2517 OKAY. WHERE WAS I? MICE. OKAY. SO THIS PARTICULAR
###2524 EXAMPLE, AND AGAIN THE DETAILS OF THIS DON'T MATTER. IT IS JUST
###2527 ILLUSTRATING THESE DIFFERENT FORMS OF MUTATION. IN THE MELANIN
###2534 
###2539 AND IS FAVORED BY SELECTION IF THEY'RE LIVING ON LAVA FLOWS, FOR
###2542 EXAMPLE. IT MAKES THEM LESS CONSPICUOUS TO A PREDATOR.
###2548 AND THAT PATHWAY, A LOT OF WHICH IS NOW KNOWN FROM STUDIES
###2553 OF MICE, YOU'VE GOT A CELL, YOU'VE GOT A RECEPTOR, ON THE EDGE OF
###2560 THAT CELL THAT WILL INTERACT WITH A HORMONE. COMING AT THIS
###2569 PARTICULAR RECEPTOR THE PROTEIN IS CALLED MC1R, MELANOCORTIN
###2576 RECEPTOR. OR WAS IT MC1R? YEAH, MC1R. SO A CHANGE IN THE CODING
###2583 SEQUENCE FOR THIS PROTEIN, IN THE DNA IN THE EXONS, CAN CHANGE
###2589 THE EFFICIENCY WITH WHICH IT RECOGNIZES THE HORMONE AND THEN
###2594 INITIATES EVENTS INSIDE THE CELL TO PRODUCE MELANIN. DON'T WORRY
###2599 ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE.
###2605 BUT IT ALSO INTERACTS. SO MSH HERE IS THE HORMONE,
###2611 MELANOCYTE STIMULATING HORMONE. SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF A CODING
###2620 MUTATION. WE'VE CHANGED MC1R TO INTERACT WITH THAT HORMONE. BUT
###2630 ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IS FROM A DIFFERENT PROTEIN CALLED A GUTI,
###2640 WHICH SUPPRESSES THE ACTION OF MC1R. SO THIS PROTEIN INTERACTS
###2648 WITH THAT PROTEIN TO DETERMINE ITS FUNCTION. AND THERE ARE NO
###2653 MUTATIONS IN MELANISTIC MICE WHERE THE CODING SEQUENCE OF THE
###2658 GUTI IS NOT CHANGED, THE GENE REGULATION IS CHANGED. THERE IS
###2660 MORE OF IT. SORRY. THERE IS LESS OF IT. SO WE'RE DECREASING A
###2667 GUTI, WHICH IS REDUCING SUPPRESSION OF MC1R, PRODUCING MORE
###2674 MELANIN. SO THE CASE OF A GUTI, THIS IS A REGULATORY MUTATION.
###2680 THIS ONE IS A CODING SEQUENCE MUTATION. NOW, THOSE TWO THINGS
###2684 INTERACT, AND ONE OR THE OTHER CAN LEAD TO THE CHANGE IN
###2689 
###2693 MUTATIONS. ONE BEING A REGULATORY MUTATION IN A PARTICULAR
###2698 PROTEIN AND OTHER BEING A CODING SEQUENCE CHANGE IN A DIFFERENT
###2701 PROTEIN WITH WHICH IT INTERACTS. EITHER ONE CAN CAUSE THE CHANGE
###2707 IN PHENOTYPE. ANY QUESTIONS? YES.
###2711 NO, GUTI IS JUST A DIFFERENT GENE. IT IS A GENE JUST LIKE
###2715 THIS. BUT IN THAT PARTICULAR CASE THE MUTATION IS ONE THAT
###2719 EFFECTS ITS EXPRESSION, A CHANGE IN THE GENE REGULATION. THE
###2723 CODING SEQUENCE OF A GUTI IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PALE MOUSE
###2727 AND A DARK MOUSE. THE CHANGE OCCURRED IN THE REGULATORY
###2731 SEQUENCES. OKAY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?
###2734 OKAY. SO, AGAIN DON'T GET HUNG UP ON THE DETAILS AND WHAT
###2742 WAS THE NAME OF THAT HORMONE AND WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THAT GENE.
###2744 THE IDEAS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUTATIONS EFFECTING PHENOTYPE.
###2748 SOMETIMES GENERATING THE SAME TYPE OF PHENOTYPE THROUGH A
###2752 MECHANISM. OKAY.
###2756 SO LET'S COME BACK TO THIS QUESTION. GENETIC DRIFT. SO IN
###2760 THE PRAIRIE CHICKEN I POINTED OUT THAT DIFFERENT POPULATIONS ARE
###2768 UNDERGOING GENETIC DRIFTING GENETICALLY. SOME ARE FIXING, THAT
###2773 IS, GOING TO ALL "A" AND SOME ARE GOING TO ALL "B" AND SOME ARE
###2776 STILL BOUNCING AROUND IN BETWEEN. SO EXPECT GENETIC DRIFT TO
###2780 INCREASE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN POPULATIONS.
###2785 SO ONE THING THAT IS OPPOSING IS MIGRATION, WHICH YOU CAN
###2801 ALSO THINK OF AS GENE FLOW. SO IF WE HAVE A COUPLE OF
###2816 POPULATIONS LIKE THIS, THIS 1P IS POINT "A" AND THIS 1P IS POINT
###2821 
###2827 IN THOSE TWO POPULATIONS. IF INDIVIDUALS ARE BORN HERE AND MOVE
###2833 OVER HERE TO REPRODUCE, IT IS ESSENTIAL THEY REPRODUCE FOR
###2838 MIGRATION TO GIVE RISE TO GENE FLOW. IF THEY ARE BORN IN ONE
###2842 POPULATION AND REPRODUCE IN ANOTHER, THEY CARRY THEIR GENES FROM
###2846 HERE TO HERE.
###2849 THINK OF VIKINGS, SAILING FROM SCANDINAVIA TO SCOTLAND AND
###2857 ENGLAND AND SO FORTH AND GENEROUSLY SHARING THEIR GENES AS THEY
###2860 WENT.
###2863 THAT'S GENE FLOW. OKAY. SO THE EFFECT OF THAT IS TO REDUCE
###2876 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN POPULATIONS. IT OPPOSES GENETIC DRIFT. IT
###2897 CAN EVEN OPPOSE LOCAL ADAPTATION. WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT
###2900 LATER.
###2907 THAT IS, IF ONE ALLELE IS FAVORED BY A SELECTION HERE AND
###2910 ANOTHER ALLELE IS FAVORED BY SELECTION HERE, THEN THESE MIGRANTS
###2914 COME ACROSS CARRYING THE WRONG ALLELE WILL SLOW DOWN THAT
###2917 RESPONSE TO SELECTION.
###2920 FINALLY, IT SPREADS MUTATIONS THROUGH THE SPECIES RANGE.
###2932 SO, SHOWING YOU AN EXAMPLE THERE ON THE SLIDE, SLIDE 7. AND
###2952 THESE ARE MEASUREMENTS OF PARTICULAR ALLELES BETWEEN TWO VERY
###2958 DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS.
###2962 HEAVILY POLLUTED SITE WITH HEAVY METALS, A MINING SITE WHERE
###2967 A PARTICULAR PHENOTYPE AND GENE IS FAVORED. IN AN ADJACENT
###2970 NONCONTAMINATED PASTURE WE SEE SOME OF THE ALLELES THAT ARE
###2975 ADVANTAGEOUS HERE YET THEY NOT ADVANTAGEOUS HERE YET THEY OCCUR
###2980 
###2980 AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS MIGRATION. BORN IN ONE PLACE OR
###2986 GAMETTES PRODUCE IN ONE PLACE, ENDING UP FORMING ZYGOTES OR
###2990 REPRODUCING IN THE OTHER POPULATION.
###2993 SO MIGRATION IS VERY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF REDUCING THIS
###2998 EFFECT, SPREADING THE MUTATIONS THAT CAN OPPOSE LOCAL ADAPTATION.
###3003 WE'LL COME TO THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SELECTION IN THE NEXT
###3008 LECTURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
###3011 REMINDER OFFICE HOURS NOW IN WHATEVER...
