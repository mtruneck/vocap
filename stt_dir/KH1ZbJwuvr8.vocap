###12 VALERIE VARGAS: I didn't like being different at school.
###14 I don't think any kid really, actually fully enjoys being
###17 different at school.
###21 I've got a really old drawing that I did of my mom when I
###24 was like 10 or 11.
###25 That's pretty cool.
###27 Where the fuck did I put it?
###29 I hope I didn't put it away.
###30 
###34 That's my mom.
###36 I do remember just copying things very early on, from age
###39 three or four, and my mom was always putting it up on the
###41 fridge and stuff.
###43 It just always kind of made me really happy and really proud
###45 that she liked what I did.
###47 That sounds really sad, but I didn't really like playing.
###49 I just really liked drawing.
###50 So, to join in, she would draw with me, and whenever she drew
###54 with me, if she drew girls--
###56 I only found out after getting into tattoing that the way she
###59 draws girls are very much like Jerry pin-ups.
###61 Because tattooing designs in general, in magazines and that
###64 stuff, so it's pretty cool that, if she was asked to draw
###67 a girl, she'd just draw a pin-up.
###69 And then, yeah, that just carried on.
###70 And, we never really thought I was ever
###73 gonna do anything else.
###73 There was never a question of it.
###75 And tattooing found me, thankfully.
###78 And, this is the way now.
###81 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###102 STEWART ROBSON: There's kind of different elements to
###104 Valerie's style.
###105 There's that kind of fantasy side.
###106 But then, there's the more tattoo-ey side, the way she
###109 can just do a really pretty version of some old flash.
###114 She's careful of doing something really cute, or
###116 something really tough, or something really beautiful, or
###118 something--
###120 she never does anything ugly, but, she can make a witch look
###124 cool, or a demon look cool.
###125 But it's still beautiful.
###127 VALERIE VARGAS: Personally, I like to base it on
###129 traditional.
###130 I do enjoy putting a little bit of extra
###131 detail here and there.
###132 Bold lines, lots of black shading, bright colors.
###136 I really enjoy doing bright colors.
###137 I'm not a fan of it when people say, oh, can you make
###139 it look old.
###140 I'm like, the brighter the better.
###143 STEFANO C.: She's a very good illustrator.
###146 She knows how to put it down.
###148 She ended up with her drawing skills to create what she got
###153 at the moment, which is something pretty unique.
###155 
###159 VALERIE VARGAS: Could you hold this?
###161 Trying to close the both and I can't.
###165 OK, I'll close that one if you hold this.
###167 
###174 My name is Valerie Vargas, and I tattoo at Frith Street.
###177 
###181 It's a little tiny shop in a basement in
###184 the middle of Soho.
###185 It's a really nice team we have, I think.
###187 We all really enjoy each other's companies.
###189 We're good friends.
###190 And we all respect each other's work.
###192 
###196 DANTE DIMASSA: I want to say we're a street shop.
###200 This was the idea behind having the shop the way it is.
###206 But we're not a street shop.
###208 We do a lot of big work.
###209 We do a lot of custom stuff.
###210 The majority of the stuff is custom.
###212 I can't remember the last time we've tattooed something
###215 straight out of a flashbook or whatever.
###218 I think we tend to more--
###220 it's not our scene, but we tend to a lot of the--
###223 
###226 we tend to a lot of kids.
###228 Yeah, show him your front.
###230 Don't be gay.
###231 
###234 It's the shop that people want and come and get not
###237 necessarily a particular tattoo, but they get a tattoo
###239 that's theirs.
###240 
###245 How old were you when you came and worked at the shop?
###250 24?
###250 25?
###250 VALERIE VARGAS: No, no.
###251 DANTE DIMASSA: Younger?
###252 Older?
###252 VALERIE VARGAS: Well, I've been here five years in
###254 August, so, 25?
###256 26?
###257 25, 26?
###258 Yeah, you were only but a young spring
###260 chicken when I met you.
###263 DANTE DIMASSA: Valerie kind of came with Stewart, really.
###266 The person who got the job offer was Stewart.
###271 I hadn't planned on giving Valerie a job, but we knew
###275 that she had a lot of promise.
###277 I had always said to myself, I wasn't gonna employ a
###281 boyfriend-girlfriend scenario here, but it seemed the
###286 natural choice to get Valerie.
###290 VALERIE VARGAS: We try and make sure that the grievance
###293 is dealt with before we get to work.
###295 
###300 Yeah, that's fucking rubbish to work with, you know.
###302 I mean that's probably the reason why Danny almost didn't
###303 give us a job together because he had at one point.
###306 Nobody can stand our company by each other, so I think
###309 that's the only reason we work out.
###310 
###317 I tattoo next to Stewart Robson, of course.
###320 Always.
###320 We seem to be a bit of a kind of double deal.
###323 Like if you're gonna have me, you're gonna have to have him,
###325 and so forth.
###326 And we really do enjoy talking over work, and like if I'm
###330 tattooing, he's tattooing, we'll shout over at each other
###333 or talk to each other's customers, so.
###334 I really enjoy working next to him.
###335 STEWART ROBSON: Sometimes she gets a little annoying.
###337 It's like having your own conscience in front of you.
###339 And you can't just ignore it.
###341 It's there, going, come on, you need to do this.
###343 VALERIE VARGAS: Are you doing any shading in
###345 the curly bits, or?
###347 STEWART ROBSON: I'm not sure.
###348 VALERIE VARGAS: Like as a black and gray
###349 shading, or color, or?
###350 STEWART ROBSON: There's some sort of there, so I might just
###352 leave that one.
###353 VALERIE VARGAS: I think you should a full Indian disco
###354 ball cut-out.
###355 
###361 I don't think she's coming back after
###363 this once you do it.
###365 STEWART ROBSON: But I was always impressed by her
###367 drawing skills.
###368 She's always so good at drawing.
###370 Particularly figurative stuff.
###371 The shape of a female body, and the way that all the
###374 joints fit together.
###376 It was impressive.
###378 
###380 VALERIE VARGAS: All right, here.
###382 Just got one more rose to do.
###386 And then we'll be done today.
###387 
###391 DANTE DIMASSA: I don't wanna say Valerie does our
###392 traditional tattooing, because it's far from being
###395 traditional.
###396 Nonetheless, the idea, the way--
###398 I suppose the execution is very traditional.
###402 VALERIE VARGAS: I think you deserve a
###403 pint of some chocolate.
###405 
###408 DANTE DIMASSA: The designs that Valerie does are still
###410 rooted in with good, solid, long-lasting tattooes.
###415 She makes it work very, very well.
###418 She's just done a back piece, a Rock of Ages back piece.
###421 I really liked that tattoo.
###422 I'd be proud to have that.
###424 I like the lack of space, do you know what I mean?
###427 I like the lack of space.
###429 When you look at it, it looks like it's breathing at you.
###432 I don't think she would want to say, my style is
###434 traditional, or my style is--
###436 I think her style is a mix of many styles put together.
###439 Jack Rudy, Scott Sylvia, Tim Lehi, Chris Conn.
###446 She's taken everything from those people and
###449 made things her own.
###450 
###458 VALERIE VARGAS: I started tattooing right after Chris
###460 Conn pretty much quit tattooing.
###462 I had seen a couple of his tattoos in older magazines.
###465 I didn't connect his name, so I wasn't really aware that
###468 this guy had been doing all these paintings that I really
###470 liked as well.
###470 And then when it all clicked in my head, I was like, oh, my
###472 god, this is amazing, you know.
###474 And can I get tattooed by him?
###476 Oh, no, I can't.
###477 Never mind.
###478 I collected quite a few of these prints.
###480 I've got the one that he did for Revisited.
###482 With all the girl heads and stuff.
###484 And I'm sure any tattooer worthy soul has that somewhere
###487 and references heavily.
###490 And even though I've always enjoyed doing girl heads, it
###493 was that print that I really got it drummed into my head
###496 what makes a successful tattooed lady head.
###499 All the little tricks and everything, and I just took
###500 that and ran away with it, and had my own style emerge.
###504 I'd like to think anyway.
###505 
###509 Ooh.
###510 Voicemail.
###511 
###513 Hello?
###515 Hey, so what's going on?
###517 
###522 Yeah.
###523 Yep.
###524 
###527 That's OK.
###527 I can do that.
###529 
###535 I honestly don't get tired of doing girl heads.
###537 People always ask me but--
###539 I love it.
###540 STEFANO C.: There was a time, like a couple of years ago
###543 that she was doing lots of girls, doing everything.
###546 Like doing like the hand holding something, doing
###549 something, lots of face expressions.
###551 VALERIE VARGAS: I did these two on the back
###552 of calves on a girl.
###554 I didn't do this one.
###555 She didn't like that one because she thought it was too
###556 much like this one, so I did a different one, with more
###558 jewelry and different hairstyle and slightly
###560 different facing.
###562 Again, they're the bane of my life.
###563 I get so many people wanting exactly those guys.
###565 It's like, you can't have exactly the same thing.
###567 That's not how it works.
###570 STEWART ROBSON: It's awesome to see someone just grab a
###575 style and wrestle with it and twist it and turn it into
###579 something else.
###581 The thing that maybe sets her apart from the Chris Conn
###584 school of tattooing is each one of the faces
###588 she draws is different.
###590 Because there's a different mood, and she's really--
###593 I think that came from her animation schooling and her
###596 love of animation.
###598 She'll watch all Disney animations endlessly.
###602 She'll watch Robin Hood again and I can't stand it.
###605 VALERIE VARGAS: At art school, I was studying animation.
###608 And it was weird, because I always felt like the art kid
###611 and then I moved to Dundee to study art, and then obviously,
###613 you're not the art kid anymore.
###615 You're just one of the art kids.
###617 
###622 I wanted to do 2D.
###623 I've always enjoyed drawing and right at the time I was
###627 learning and I was in that course, 3D started.
###629 Toy Story had just come out like the year before,
###632 and that was it.
###633 That was the beginning of the end.
###634 And to actually use a computer as your primary source of
###638 creativity--
###639 ugh, no, not for me.
###641 I want to get stuck into something and physically be in
###644 charge of it and not having to do it through another medium
###646 which, again for me--
###647 tattooing is just perfect.
###648 
###656 You will sit here, and I will cause you pain, and you will
###658 pay me for it.
###659 SPEAKER 1: OK.
###659 And I'll be thankful for it.
###660
