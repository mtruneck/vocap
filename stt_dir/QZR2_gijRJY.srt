1
0:0:2,267 --> 0:0:4,33
Hi, I'm Sharon Long,


2
0:0:4,33 --> 0:0:5,533
from Stanford University.


3
0:0:5,533 --> 0:0:9,3
I'm here today to tell you about some remarkable organisms,


4
0:0:9,3 --> 0:0:13,33
two kinds of organisms in fact, bacteria and plants.


5
0:0:13,33 --> 0:0:16,633
Together, they can do something that neither can do alone:


6
0:0:16,633 --> 0:0:19,7
They can bring nitrogen, in its molecular form,


7
0:0:19,7 --> 0:0:21,8
which is usually very inert,


8
0:0:21,8 --> 0:0:25,233
they can bring that nitrogen into a chemically combined form


9
0:0:25,233 --> 0:0:28,367
that can be used for protein nutrition.


10
0:0:28,367 --> 0:0:30,8
So, I'll have three topics overall.


11
0:0:30,8 --> 0:0:36,467
First, I'd like to give you an introduction to the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis,


12
0:0:36,467 --> 0:0:40,133
in particular, between Rhizobium and legumes.


13
0:0:40,133 --> 0:0:42,367
I'd then like to focus, in my second segment,


14
0:0:42,367 --> 0:0:46,867
on the bacterial genes that are used for the response to the plant,


15
0:0:46,867 --> 0:0:49,667
and for the bacteria to be able to provoke the plant,


16
0:0:49,667 --> 0:0:55,233
in order to make the home for the bacteria, once they invade.


17
0:0:55,233 --> 0:0:58,67
And in the final segment, I'd like to tell you some of our new research


18
0:0:58,67 --> 0:1:1,5
on how the plant responds to the signals


19
0:1:1,5 --> 0:1:3,7
that come from the bacteria.


20
0:1:3,7 --> 0:1:6,0
So now, in the first segment, as I mentioned,


21
0:1:6,0 --> 0:1:8,433
we have an overview. I'm going to tell you about


22
0:1:8,433 --> 0:1:10,8
something called "root nodules" and how these


23
0:1:10,8 --> 0:1:15,433
root nodules form and how they work.


24
0:1:15,433 --> 0:1:17,8
To get us started, I'd like to address a subject


25
0:1:17,8 --> 0:1:20,933
near and dear to all our hearts, and that is food.


26
0:1:20,933 --> 0:1:23,533
When we think about food, we're aware of the need for balance.


27
0:1:23,533 --> 0:1:27,2
We need carbohydrates, fats, proteins.


28
0:1:27,2 --> 0:1:32,8
And proteins, it turns out, are a particular issue in nutrition,


29
0:1:32,8 --> 0:1:35,667
because proteins, unlike carbohydrates and fats


30
0:1:35,667 --> 0:1:38,867
for the most part, require a great deal of nitrogen,


31
0:1:38,867 --> 0:1:41,467
and nitrogen is scarce.


32
0:1:41,467 --> 0:1:46,9
That means that protein malnutrition, the inability to get enough protein,


33
0:1:46,9 --> 0:1:52,133
can happen whenever agriculture is deficient or when yields are low,


34
0:1:52,133 --> 0:1:54,3
and it's one of the most devastating problems


35
0:1:54,3 --> 0:1:59,867
for human health worldwide. So, in Western cultures,


36
0:1:59,867 --> 0:2:2,8
when we think about getting protein, we may think,


37
0:2:2,8 --> 0:2:5,233
well, I need to have a protein-rich food.


38
0:2:5,233 --> 0:2:9,33
Something, which we're going to remember, has a lot of nitrogen.


39
0:2:9,33 --> 0:2:11,767
We're going to think about, for example, some poultry.


40
0:2:11,767 --> 0:2:16,633
And here they are, poultry, a very protein-rich food.


41
0:2:16,633 --> 0:2:21,7
Now, we're thinking about the theme of nitrogen, it's a critical element.


42
0:2:21,7 --> 0:2:23,7
Where did these animals get their nitrogen


43
0:2:23,7 --> 0:2:26,433
so that they can make protein? They get it from plants.


44
0:2:26,433 --> 0:2:31,533
And ultimately, of course, whether we eat meat or eat plants,


45
0:2:31,533 --> 0:2:36,333
all human protein ultimately comes from plants.


46
0:2:36,333 --> 0:2:39,7
So that raises the question, where do the plants get their nitrogen?


47
0:2:39,7 --> 0:2:41,967
The answer is, they get from the soil.


48
0:2:41,967 --> 0:2:44,933
Soils include compounds such as nitrates;


49
0:2:44,933 --> 0:2:48,5
they will include organic nitrogen, which might be provided


50
0:2:48,5 --> 0:2:52,633
from manure or decomposition of plant matter.


51
0:2:52,633 --> 0:2:54,8
And the plants will take up this nitrogen,


52
0:2:54,8 --> 0:2:58,5
they will synthesize amino acids from the soil nitrogen,


53
0:2:58,5 --> 0:3:1,67
and from those, they make proteins,


54
0:3:1,67 --> 0:3:5,233
and then we in turn can get our protein from those plants.


55
0:3:5,233 --> 0:3:8,8
However, if a field is used over and over again,


56
0:3:8,8 --> 0:3:10,833
ultimately it becomes depleted for nitrogen.


57
0:3:10,833 --> 0:3:14,3
And that means that this infertile soil is not able


58
0:3:14,3 --> 0:3:19,367
to support plant yield or plant nitrogen.


59
0:3:19,367 --> 0:3:21,167
Now how do we overcome that?


60
0:3:21,167 --> 0:3:26,6
At large scales of agriculture, when fields are used quite often,


61
0:3:26,6 --> 0:3:30,1
then the soil the soil can be restored by applications


62
0:3:30,1 --> 0:3:33,967
of nitrogen fertilizer, it's usually in the form of ammonium.


63
0:3:33,967 --> 0:3:37,633
Now, ammonium, remarkably, can actually be made from


64
0:3:37,633 --> 0:3:41,67
molecular nitrogen, which is in the air, which is very abundant.


65
0:3:41,67 --> 0:3:45,5
That you may know: The vast majority of the atmosphere is made of nitrogen.


66
0:3:45,5 --> 0:3:47,0
But it's incredibly inert.


67
0:3:47,0 --> 0:3:51,367
It won't combine with anything, this triple-bond nitrogen.


68
0:3:51,367 --> 0:3:57,8
So, in order to coax that nitrogen into a combined form of ammonium,


69
0:3:57,8 --> 0:4:0,867
there's a process called the Haber-Bosch process,


70
0:4:0,867 --> 0:4:4,33
which is able to take molecule nitrogen,


71
0:4:4,33 --> 0:4:8,533
combine it with hydrogen gas at very high temperature,


72
0:4:8,533 --> 0:4:12,7
very high pressure, with a metal catalyst, and convert it to ammonium.


73
0:4:12,7 --> 0:4:16,233
That ammonium can then be applied on a field.


74
0:4:16,233 --> 0:4:18,833
The plants will take up the ammonium, they will make protein,


75
0:4:18,833 --> 0:4:23,5
and the yield is therefore supported.


76
0:4:23,5 --> 0:4:25,533
But the problem is this:


77
0:4:25,533 --> 0:4:31,3
How do we get high temperature and pressure? It's by using fossil fuels.


78
0:4:31,3 --> 0:4:35,667
It's mostly natural gas, but other fossil fuels can be used,


79
0:4:35,667 --> 0:4:40,667
and we're all aware of the scarcity and the price of fossil fuels,


80
0:4:40,667 --> 0:4:44,267
and what lies in the future for their availability.


81
0:4:44,267 --> 0:4:48,133
That means that we can't necessarily depend on


82
0:4:48,133 --> 0:4:54,367
unlimited supplies of this kind of ammonium fertilizer.


83
0:4:54,367 --> 0:4:58,233
Are there alternatives? And it turns out, for millennia,


84
0:4:58,233 --> 0:5:3,3
farmers in every continent of the world have known of another way.


85
0:5:3,3 --> 0:5:7,9
That is the use of legumes, a very special group of plants.


86
0:5:7,9 --> 0:5:12,33
It's a plant family, the Leguminosae, also called Fabaceae,


87
0:5:12,33 --> 0:5:16,767
the third largest family in the angiosperms, or flowering plants.


88
0:5:16,767 --> 0:5:20,5
Legumes have this remarkable property that they can associate


89
0:5:20,5 --> 0:5:24,5
with bacteria from the soil, they can grow a


90
0:5:24,5 --> 0:5:27,367
new organ called a root nodule.


91
0:5:27,367 --> 0:5:31,667
The bacteria live inside the root nodule, and once the bacteria are there,


92
0:5:31,667 --> 0:5:38,967
the bacteria are converting nitrogen into ammonia through an enzyme.


93
0:5:38,967 --> 0:5:41,367
This is still energy-intensive.


94
0:5:41,367 --> 0:5:46,3
As biochemists, we wouldn't see that it uses highly reduced electrons


95
0:5:46,3 --> 0:5:49,733
and a lot of ATP, but is that coming from?


96
0:5:49,733 --> 0:5:51,533
It's coming from sunlight.


97
0:5:51,533 --> 0:5:57,833
So, the advantage of this is that we're able to nourish plants,


98
0:5:57,833 --> 0:6:1,6
and those plants then in turn can nourish the soil,


99
0:6:1,6 --> 0:6:5,4
in a process that uses a biological catalyst at room temperature,


100
0:6:5,4 --> 0:6:11,933
at ordinary pressure, and uses sunlight to drive it.


101
0:6:11,933 --> 0:6:16,433
Now, as I mentioned, farmers throughout the ancient world


102
0:6:16,433 --> 0:6:19,8
knew about this. They didn't know why it happened,


103
0:6:19,8 --> 0:6:26,833
but they could see that the use of legumes in agriculture to rotate,


104
0:6:26,833 --> 0:6:31,5
or to use as a green manure, would assure the fertility of their soil.


105
0:6:31,5 --> 0:6:35,0
In the New World, farmers used the common bean,


106
0:6:35,0 --> 0:6:39,733
which is a New World plant. In the Mediterranean, they used lupins.


107
0:6:39,733 --> 0:6:45,6
In China, they used soybean. And in South Asia and Africa, the cow pea.


108
0:6:45,6 --> 0:6:47,733
So again, throughout the world,


109
0:6:47,733 --> 0:6:53,533
crop rotation has been used as a key element of sustainable agriculture.


110
0:6:53,533 --> 0:6:56,0
So from that view of real nodules,


111
0:6:56,0 --> 0:6:58,967
I'd like to draw back just a moment for a cartoon,


112
0:6:58,967 --> 0:7:3,333
so that I can describe this in a more simplified way.


113
0:7:3,333 --> 0:7:7,133
We know that we're talking about legumes and the way


114
0:7:7,133 --> 0:7:10,5
in which they form a symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.


115
0:7:10,5 --> 0:7:12,767
And one of the key elements of this


116
0:7:12,767 --> 0:7:16,8
is that it's able to be used to replace nitrogen fertilizer.


117
0:7:16,8 --> 0:7:22,0
How does this happen? So, in a schematic form,


118
0:7:22,0 --> 0:7:25,533
we can imagine that there are these bacteria, the Rhizobium bacteria,


119
0:7:25,533 --> 0:7:26,733
that grow in the soil.


120
0:7:26,733 --> 0:7:29,1
They're able to grow slowly as saprophytes,


121
0:7:29,1 --> 0:7:32,833
just scavenging nutrients from the soil.


122
0:7:32,833 --> 0:7:36,633
And here's a plant, which, again, could grow if there's fertilizer.


123
0:7:36,633 --> 0:7:40,633
But in the absence, it's going to have a hard time.


124
0:7:40,633 --> 0:7:43,7
So, if we've got the right bacteria and plant,


125
0:7:43,7 --> 0:7:47,33
and I'm going to talk to about that specificity again in a few minutes,


126
0:7:47,33 --> 0:7:48,933
they interact to form these:


127
0:7:48,933 --> 0:7:52,233
What's shown here in red are root nodules,


128
0:7:52,233 --> 0:7:54,467
specialized organs that grow on the root,


129
0:7:54,467 --> 0:8:1,0
within which the bacteria are able to fix nitrogen.


130
0:8:1,0 --> 0:8:6,567
So, this is where it's all happening. I love this!


131
0:8:6,567 --> 0:8:9,67
These are nodules, they're growing on a soybean plant,


132
0:8:9,67 --> 0:8:11,233
so you can see some of the nodules here,


133
0:8:11,233 --> 0:8:14,167
the growths that are occurring on the root.


134
0:8:14,167 --> 0:8:18,1
The plant is up there, and the nodules,


135
0:8:18,1 --> 0:8:21,967
once they fix nitrogen and make amino acids,


136
0:8:21,967 --> 0:8:25,567
the plant is able to take those amino acids, put it up in the shoot,


137
0:8:25,567 --> 0:8:29,267
where it can make chlorophyll, where it can make proteins,


138
0:8:29,267 --> 0:8:34,2
and ultimately, to make high-protein seeds.


139
0:8:34,2 --> 0:8:37,733
Now I'd like to make several points about this.


140
0:8:37,733 --> 0:8:42,967
First, the bacteria in these nodules are fixing nitrogen,


141
0:8:42,967 --> 0:8:45,667
but even that is energy intensive.


142
0:8:45,667 --> 0:8:50,567
And as I mentioned, ultimately, it's sunlight, through photosynthesis,


143
0:8:50,567 --> 0:8:53,7
that allows the plant to support this energy-intensive process


144
0:8:53,7 --> 0:8:57,933
of nitrogen fixation. It's occurring only in the root nodules,


145
0:8:57,933 --> 0:9:0,867
it doesn't occur anywhere else in the plant.


146
0:9:0,867 --> 0:9:3,667
This association is highly specific,


147
0:9:3,667 --> 0:9:6,6
and I'll show you that in a moment with a table.


148
0:9:6,6 --> 0:9:9,9
It's also established through a complex developmental process,


149
0:9:9,9 --> 0:9:14,333
and I'll show you some microscopic views of that.


150
0:9:14,333 --> 0:9:20,5
And remarkably, this process is restricted,


151
0:9:20,5 --> 0:9:23,367
with one known exception only, in the world.


152
0:9:23,367 --> 0:9:27,2
It's restricted to one family, the legume family.


153
0:9:27,2 --> 0:9:30,867
We know a little bit about why that occurs,


154
0:9:30,867 --> 0:9:34,3
but there's a lot left to find out.


155
0:9:34,3 --> 0:9:39,167
The legumes I've mentioned are part of the large family,


156
0:9:39,167 --> 0:9:41,733
which includes both agriculturally important


157
0:9:41,733 --> 0:9:44,8
and environmentally important species.


158
0:9:44,8 --> 0:9:48,533
When we think of high-protein plants, many of the plants


159
0:9:48,533 --> 0:9:54,4
that come to mind are in fact the legumes.


160
0:9:54,4 --> 0:9:59,533
Both in terms of their seed content and in terms of the content of their leaves.


161
0:9:59,533 --> 0:10:3,67
We're familiar with the soybean, cow pea,


162
0:10:3,67 --> 0:10:6,767
common bean, all being high-protein seeds.


163
0:10:6,767 --> 0:10:9,133
The pea, again, a high-protein seed.


164
0:10:9,133 --> 0:10:13,567
Also, alfalfa, which is used as a forage for animals,


165
0:10:13,567 --> 0:10:15,667
it has very high-protein leaves.


166
0:10:15,667 --> 0:10:20,267
That's why it's so nourishing for animals such as cattle and horses.


167
0:10:20,267 --> 0:10:26,67
But beyond the uses for human nutrition, these plants


168
0:10:26,67 --> 0:10:30,267
are very important in many natural ecosystems throughout the world.


169
0:10:30,267 --> 0:10:33,5
We might think, for example, of this acacia


170
0:10:33,5 --> 0:10:36,367
growing up in the African plain.


171
0:10:36,367 --> 0:10:39,433
Or we could think of this mesquite tree,


172
0:10:39,433 --> 0:10:42,533
let me show you this one over here.


173
0:10:42,533 --> 0:10:45,9
And here, a broom plant, a shrub.


174
0:10:45,9 --> 0:10:49,33
These legume shrubs and trees often grow


175
0:10:49,33 --> 0:10:52,2
in relatively harsh environments, where they provide nutrition


176
0:10:52,2 --> 0:10:55,867
for the soil that's around them.


177
0:10:55,867 --> 0:11:0,367
So, coming back to the development process,


178
0:11:0,367 --> 0:11:5,67
what we want to know is how is it that those incredibly diverse


179
0:11:5,67 --> 0:11:11,1
groups of plants are able to establish the association


180
0:11:11,1 --> 0:11:15,333
with Rhizobium, and why don't other plants do it?


181
0:11:15,333 --> 0:11:21,567
So, I'd now like to tell you a little bit about the specificity.


182
0:11:21,567 --> 0:11:25,0
Beyond the specificity for the legume family,


183
0:11:25,0 --> 0:11:29,733
within that very diverse family, specific legume types,


184
0:11:29,733 --> 0:11:34,9
such as the soybean, are nodulated not just by any old bacterium,


185
0:11:34,9 --> 0:11:37,4
but only by certain restricted groups.


186
0:11:37,4 --> 0:11:39,267
So here we're looking at the soybean,


187
0:11:39,267 --> 0:11:42,6
and here I'm showing you two different species that are known


188
0:11:42,6 --> 0:11:45,4
to form symbiotic root nodules on soybean.


189
0:11:45,4 --> 0:11:48,367
Here we have the pea. It's a legume also,


190
0:11:48,367 --> 0:11:51,133
but its nodulating bacterium is a different one:


191
0:11:51,133 --> 0:11:53,0
Rhizobium leguminosarum.


192
0:11:53,0 --> 0:11:56,8
I'll have occasion to mention pea and Rhizobium leguminosarum


193
0:11:56,8 --> 0:11:59,667
in the second half of my introduction.


194
0:11:59,667 --> 0:12:3,333
Here we have a lotus plant called trefoil,


195
0:12:3,333 --> 0:12:8,4
and it's nodulated by a different genus, Mesorhizobium, species loti.


196
0:12:8,4 --> 0:12:9,9
And the system that I study,


197
0:12:9,9 --> 0:12:13,433
which is the genus Medicago, which includes alfalfa,


198
0:12:13,433 --> 0:12:17,733
and which is nodulated by Sinorhizobium meliloti.


199
0:12:17,733 --> 0:12:19,6
This is the species you'll hear about,


200
0:12:19,6 --> 0:12:22,0
in terms of the direct experiments that I describe,


201
0:12:22,0 --> 0:12:24,7
through the rest of my talk, with the one comparison


202
0:12:24,7 --> 0:12:27,2
that I've mentioned earlier.


203
0:12:27,2 --> 0:12:32,433
Now, I've told you that nodule development is complex,


204
0:12:32,433 --> 0:12:34,3
but I haven't really shown you what I mean.


205
0:12:34,3 --> 0:12:36,567
And so that's what we want to do next.


206
0:12:36,567 --> 0:12:43,7
In looking at this, the primary approach that I'll tell you is through microscopy,


207
0:12:43,7 --> 0:12:46,0
but embedded in that microscopy,


208
0:12:46,0 --> 0:12:50,367
I'll also tell you a little bit about the physiology.


209
0:12:50,367 --> 0:12:56,2
So, one of the first changes that occurs when Rhizobium meet a plant,


210
0:12:56,2 --> 0:12:59,133
is that the root hairs, which are ordinarily straight,


211
0:12:59,133 --> 0:13:3,433
and here's an example of a fairly normal-looking root hair right here...


212
0:13:3,433 --> 0:13:7,333
instead, root hairs grow in a way that's deformed.


213
0:13:7,333 --> 0:13:10,567
Now don't think of this as root hairs curling.


214
0:13:10,567 --> 0:13:12,3
Plant cells don't curve.


215
0:13:12,3 --> 0:13:17,6
Think of a plant cell as a balloon inflated really hard inside a box.


216
0:13:17,6 --> 0:13:21,833
Plant cells don't curl, but they can grow so that they form a curl,


217
0:13:21,833 --> 0:13:23,467
and that's what happens here.


218
0:13:23,467 --> 0:13:26,467
If you take a look at this root hair, instead of growing straight,


219
0:13:26,467 --> 0:13:29,567
it's grown so that it tops over and makes


220
0:13:29,567 --> 0:13:32,767
what's called a "shepherd's crook" or "crozier."


221
0:13:32,767 --> 0:13:35,367
In that, you can see a bacterial invasion,


222
0:13:35,367 --> 0:13:37,633
which is called an infection thread, and that's shown here


223
0:13:37,633 --> 0:13:44,433
at this highly refractile line going down through the root hair.


224
0:13:44,433 --> 0:13:49,0
Now, at the same time that invasion is occurring on the outside,


225
0:13:49,0 --> 0:13:53,3
early events are also occurring inside the plant root,


226
0:13:53,3 --> 0:13:56,9
so I want you to imagine that the plant root is going out this way.


227
0:13:56,9 --> 0:13:59,33
Now here we have an uninfected plant root,


228
0:13:59,33 --> 0:14:1,2
it's typical plant root cells,


229
0:14:1,2 --> 0:14:3,967
you can see they're very long.


230
0:14:3,967 --> 0:14:8,0
They look "empty," that's because they're mostly filled with vacuoles,


231
0:14:8,0 --> 0:14:10,5
a large vacuole.


232
0:14:10,5 --> 0:14:16,6
Plant root cells, in the cortex here, have one main job:


233
0:14:16,6 --> 0:14:19,667
That is to transport and transport and transport...


234
0:14:19,667 --> 0:14:22,467
water, ions, nutrients, and so forth.


235
0:14:22,467 --> 0:14:25,6
That's what these cells do; they don't divide.


236
0:14:25,6 --> 0:14:29,133
But if the correct Rhizobium, and this is an example of something


237
0:14:29,133 --> 0:14:32,633
that happens only if you have the right species of bacterium and plant...


238
0:14:32,633 --> 0:14:37,933
if the correct Rhizobium is infected onto that plant, you get this.


239
0:14:37,933 --> 0:14:40,733
You can see the mitotic figures happening here,


240
0:14:40,733 --> 0:14:45,4
the cells in the inner cortex of the root have begun to divide.


241
0:14:45,4 --> 0:14:50,267
They're going to form what's called a "primordium."


242
0:14:50,267 --> 0:14:52,833
Those cells continue dividing,


243
0:14:52,833 --> 0:14:56,433
and the infection that started with an infection thread,


244
0:14:56,433 --> 0:15:0,633
continues all the way through into these newly dividing cells.


245
0:15:0,633 --> 0:15:4,0
Here you can see a cell that's just starting to divide.


246
0:15:4,0 --> 0:15:8,533
And what happens is that, if you can follow this arrow,


247
0:15:8,533 --> 0:15:13,833
you can see right here, there is a little, membrane-bound,


248
0:15:13,833 --> 0:15:15,4
kind of an empty-looking vacuole,


249
0:15:15,4 --> 0:15:18,567
and within it, a peach-colored oblong.


250
0:15:18,567 --> 0:15:21,2
That is a single Rhizobium bacterium that's


251
0:15:21,2 --> 0:15:24,867
being taken up into the host cell, and it's being engulfed


252
0:15:24,867 --> 0:15:28,933
by plant plasma membrane that's going to differentiate


253
0:15:28,933 --> 0:15:33,367
and provide a special compartment that the Rhizobium


254
0:15:33,367 --> 0:15:37,167
will be in when it starts to fix nitrogen.


255
0:15:37,167 --> 0:15:41,167
So, the bacteria at this point are released from the infection thread,


256
0:15:41,167 --> 0:15:45,267
and they're bound in plant membrane sacs.


257
0:15:45,267 --> 0:15:48,9
But that doesn't do justice to what's going on.


258
0:15:48,9 --> 0:15:52,0
This bacterium is part of a more elaborate compartment,


259
0:15:52,0 --> 0:15:55,867
and I'm showing that compartment here.


260
0:15:55,867 --> 0:16:0,933
This, shown in orange, is the bacterium.


261
0:16:0,933 --> 0:16:3,2
But you see there's an extra boundary.


262
0:16:3,2 --> 0:16:6,8
There's not just the bacterial membrane, but there's another membrane.


263
0:16:6,8 --> 0:16:9,467
That's referred to as the symbiosome membrane.


264
0:16:9,467 --> 0:16:11,967
It's derived from the plant plasma membrane


265
0:16:11,967 --> 0:16:16,267
that was used to engulf the bacterium when it first entered the host cell.


266
0:16:16,267 --> 0:16:20,133
But at this point, it's become a distinctive compartment,


267
0:16:20,133 --> 0:16:25,0
with its own protein trafficking signals.


268
0:16:25,0 --> 0:16:29,5
I'll just tell you a little bit about the basics of transport.


269
0:16:29,5 --> 0:16:32,33
Of course, this is the real action:


270
0:16:32,33 --> 0:16:38,33
We have nitrogen converted enzymatically into ammonium.


271
0:16:38,33 --> 0:16:41,6
This uses ATP and highly reduced electrons,


272
0:16:41,6 --> 0:16:46,567
and that ammonium is in turn transported out to the plant.


273
0:16:46,567 --> 0:16:50,367
As I've mentioned before, the bacterium gets energy from the plant.


274
0:16:50,367 --> 0:16:55,967
Malate, and other dicarboxylic acids, are transported into the bacterium.


275
0:16:55,967 --> 0:16:59,667
From there, they enter into the bacteria's own metabolism.


276
0:16:59,667 --> 0:17:2,967
So, plant photosynthate providing energy,


277
0:17:2,967 --> 0:17:6,7
bacterial nitrogen fixation providing ammonium.


278
0:17:6,7 --> 0:17:10,67
That had been suspected for a long time.


279
0:17:10,67 --> 0:17:14,633
But emerging data from a number of labs shows that there's more going on.


280
0:17:14,633 --> 0:17:18,3
In fact, genetic data show a shuttle involving


281
0:17:18,3 --> 0:17:21,733
amino acids that are transported in and out,


282
0:17:21,733 --> 0:17:25,8
is also critical to sustain nitrogen fixation.


283
0:17:25,8 --> 0:17:31,7
How this occurs is a subject of a great deal of ongoing research.


284
0:17:31,7 --> 0:17:36,267
We've got all of these cells, which are packed with bacteria,


285
0:17:36,267 --> 0:17:37,8
which are fixing nitrogen.


286
0:17:37,8 --> 0:17:45,367
So inside these cells, we've got ammonia created from molecular nitrogen.


287
0:17:45,367 --> 0:17:49,733
And over here, you can see the vasculature of the plant,


288
0:17:49,733 --> 0:17:55,1
so you can imagine that the stem of the root is going to go up like this,


289
0:17:55,1 --> 0:17:58,867
and the stele, the vascular tissue in the root,


290
0:17:58,867 --> 0:18:2,367
is going to transport all of those amino acids up to nourish


291
0:18:2,367 --> 0:18:5,2
the rest of the plant.


292
0:18:5,2 --> 0:18:9,8
So, I've now shown you in this first part of the overview


293
0:18:9,8 --> 0:18:15,167
that nodulation occurs by a very complex developmental process.


294
0:18:15,167 --> 0:18:18,4
It's species-specific, and the events that I showed you


295
0:18:18,4 --> 0:18:21,7
occur only if the correct Rhizobium and correct plant


296
0:18:21,7 --> 0:18:24,867
come into combination. Now, in the next segment,


297
0:18:24,867 --> 0:18:30,367
what I'd like to do is talk about how the bacteria and the plant


298
0:18:30,367 --> 0:18:33,167
create signals that stimulate each other to


299
0:18:33,167 --> 0:18:35,867
begin their developmental process.


300
0:18:35,867 --> 0:18:39,867
And so in that next slide, we're going to ask this question:


301
0:18:39,867 --> 0:20:39,867
How do plants and bacteria use chemical signals for recognition?
