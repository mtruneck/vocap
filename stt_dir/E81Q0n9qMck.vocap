###6 Millionaire industrialist, Rupert Crandall's daughter, Emily had been
###10 kidnapped.
###11 George and I were set to drop the ransom. Time was of the essence.
###14 Are you sure we're in the right place?
###16 The botanical gardens at closing, George.
###19 The instructions were quite clear.
###21 It just seems like we're the only ones here.
###41 (Constable) Irwin? Sir, Sir! (Constable) Worsley? The detective is looking for you. And FYI (For Your Information)?
###44 He's not in a good mood.
###48 FYI? Is that a woman constable?
###49 No Sir--She's a sergeant! She's wearing trousers!
###56 
###58 
###59 
###62 
###65 Are you serious? Are you even serious?
###68 You need to grow a pair ...
###70 No, no! You need to grow a pair (of testicles) and do your job like man!
###71 Is this HIM? George?
###78 Only my grandmother calls me that and she's dead.
###81 Nice suit.
###85 Where do they these pencil-necked geeks? Crandall's refusing to do-over because we screwed up the drop.
###92 We got to find his daughter ASAP (as soon as possible).
###94 Grace Crandall?
###99 Oh, so you don't just dress stupid.
###103 What's ASAP?
###108 How could this be?
###109 Where was I? In a dream?
###112 It felt so real.
###114 Even the same girl had been kidnapped.
###116 But I had to get back and find the real Grace Crandall.
###120 I just couldn't see how.
###121 What else can I do but go along.
###125 All right, car rules: no eating, no drinking, no smoking, no touching, no breathing.
###129 Oh! This is a lovely
###133 lovely modern automobile!
###135 I wonder how fast it goes? It smells a bit strange.
###139 Uh... Shall I crank the engine?
###141 No, you shall shut up. I got the engine.
###146 We're going to see my "narc". She's undercover. "Narc"?
###150 Yeah, narcotics (police officer). You know, they investigate cocaine and heroin?
###154 Why? Those drugs are perfectly legal!
###157 I think you've been doing some of those drugs!
###165 uh...Ha, ha, ha....
###168 This wasn't the Toronto I knew. This was a Toronto even George could not have imagined.
###172 Buildings as tall as the clouds, automobiles and people crowding the streets.
###176 Everyone seemed so impatient, especially my new partner.
###180 Get out of my way!
###181 That's not very nice, George.
###183 That's Crabtree.
###187 Oh! Is that legal?
###204 Julia?
###205 Shut up! You're blowing my cover!
###207 Who's the rookie?
###208 He's my new partner, Detective Murdoch.
###212 He's cute.
###213 He's kind of uptight, but he's cute.
###215 What do you got for me Jules?
###217 It seems you little kidnapped heiress had a big nasty habit. What? Blow (Cocaine)?
###222 Gambling. She was in deep (in debt). Three guesses as to who played the bookie.
###230 I recognize this building.
###233 Yeah, every cop in town knows this building.
###236 And HE'S why. Is that...?
###240 Brackenreid.
###241 Toronto's number one bookie. He's a nasty character.
###244 He's going down this time. I don't care if it costs me my badge.
###249 Everything was upside down!
###250 Inspector Brackenreid a crime lord?
###252 Julia undercover?
###254 Drugs illegal?
###255 Women policemen?
###257 Toronto, but not Tornto.
###258 But strangest of all,
###260 the same crime
###261 in two different ages.
###262 Now I had to save the life of not one
###265 but two Grace Crandalls. And I had no idea how.
###269 Oh, George. I think you should slow down.
###271 I'm going to be sick!
###287 
###289 
###293 Henry? Well, well, well.
###294 Detective Crabtree.
###295 Can I help you?
###297 No.  Thanks. George!
###301 Are you my grandmother? No, so don't call me George.
###306 You're my partner, so get my back and keep mouth shut! Police brutality!  --You shut up too!
###309 Wait, Higgins.  We must act like a gentleman that we are.
###312 You're coming for a ride downtown (to the police station).
###314 Always happy to help out the "Boys in Blue", son?
###317 H, be a good boy and mind the pub while I go for a ride with my good pals here.
###323 Oh and do me a favour?
###324 Give my brief a call.
###326 That's "lawyer" to you, son? Are you all right, Henry?
###337 So we can see them
###338 but they can't see us?
###341 You've never seen interrogation before? Well not through a half-silvered mirror.
###346 I don't know why it didn't occur to me.
###347 It's ingenious!
###350 You really appreciate the little things, don't you?
###352 This world is full of
###353 man's ingenuity.
###355 It's humbling.
###357 You are SO strange.
###361 And SO not my type!
###364 This Julia was so different,
###366 yet so much the same. I was happy to be working with her again free from our
###370 former restraints, at least in this world. Well, if it isn't the "Hogtown Hustler"!
###375 They're starting.
###376 Ah yes, of course.
###378 Take off your glasses, Brackenreid.
###380 Your future's not that bright.
###384 Where's the girl?
###386 You'll have to be more specific.
###388 You know I know.
###390 Is that a riddle?
###391 Grace Crandall had a gambling problem.  She owed you money. You thought that by kidnapping her, you not only collect your dough,
###396 but also a healthy bonus from her old man on top.
###399 What a fiendish plot.
###401 I hope you catch the devil behind it because despite what your compunctions believe otherwise,
###405 I'm not in the book-making business. Just tell me where she is!
###409 You've got nothing on me.
###411 And I've got nothing to tell you.
###414 What!?!
###416 Sorry, Sir.
###416 Mr. Brackenreid's lawyer is here.
###422 Ah, it seems that our time is up, Detective.
###425 An entertaining chat as always.
###430 Oh and, I would like to wish you the best with this missing girl.
###439 Hi George! -- He can't see you. -- Right!
###444 What do you mean you need PROOF!
###449 He's quite unpleasant.
###451 I would have used a different word.
###452 The inspector is correct.  We do require evidence but George is right about
###457 Brackenreid, isn't he?  Don't call him George.
###459 Seriously.
###462 You can't be principled to be a cop in the city.
###464 I don't think that's true.  You're so old-fashioned.  It's cute.
###471 Are you sure we've never met before?  You just seem so familiar.
###477 Julia, would you believe me if i told you
###479 that I'm not from here?
###482 Yes! I would believe you.
###484 What I mean to say ...
###488 My case!  My way!
###490 Screw this!
###492 Brackenreid is so guilty, I can smell it!
###497 And I don't care what some paper-pushing,
###498 political butt-kisser has to say about that.
###501 I'm going to get Grace Crandall.
###503 You two can decide if following some lame procedure is more important
###505 than saving a girl's life.
###509 That's a very good point.
###516 Aren't you ... ?  -- Grace Crandall. --I escaped.  --From whom?
###521 Dr. Grace?
###522 Doctor?
###523 Murdoch, she just needs some air.
###525 Grace Crandall was safe but how and why?
###528 Was Brackenreid behind this?
###531 Was there more than met the eye?
###533 Even if i could somehow leave this time, I wasn't quite prepared to give up
###536 Julia again.
###539 Did I belong here with her or in 1899 without her?
###556 A door was open.  I ran.
###558 Where were you?
###559 I don't know. It was dark.
###561 Well, when you ran through the door where did you come out?
###565 I don't know.
###566 I just started running and now I'm here.
###570 Who kidnapped you? I don't know.
###574 Did you hear any voices?
###576 Maybe. How many?
###578 I couldn't tell.
###580 Were they male or female? I really don't remember.
###584 What DO you remember?
###587 I was at home.
###589 I heard a noise.
###591 And then I smelled something sweet.
###594 I passed out. I woke up and saw the open door,
###597 and now I'm here.
###601 Did you run here ASAP?
###609 Even if she was chloroformed, she would at least remember some landmark between
###613 the captor's lair and here.
###615 Yes, thank you Poindexter.
###616 He makes a valid point.
###618 Who is this Poindexter?
###620 You were raised my monks in Tibet, right?
###624 No, Jesuit priests in Nova-Scotia.
###628 That explains a lot, actually.
###630 Look, Brackenreid is the missing link in whatever is going on here.
###633 I'm going to stake him out and see if I can find some answers. Are you two in or not?
###639 "Stake out" means "watch".
###641 Uh... yes!
###643 Well, perhaps we should stake out Grace Crandall as well. She seems to have something to hide.
###647 Oh well, looky here! Maybe there's a cop under that monkey suit after all.
###651 And don't let that go to your head. Brains can only get you so far in this world.
###655 I'll tail the Crandall girl and you two, (Can you) play nice?
###664 I don't like your suit either.
###678 He has just gone back inside.
###679 He's still alone.
###680 Incredible!
###682 This camera uses no mirrors at all!
###685 And this tiny electronic wafer appears to be where all of the images are stored.
###689 Oh my god, just make some more coffee, will you?
###696 Everyday conveniences automated!
###699 The implications are astounding. Murdoch, do me a solid and shut up, will you? I'm trying to concentrate here!
###704 
###705 A "solid".  That's a favour, yes? Yeah.
###710 "Full HD" Oooh!
###715 George, have you considered the possibility of any other suspects?
###719 No.
###721 Given that we have no evidence linking Brackenreid to the crime perhaps it would behoove us
###725 No! It's not going to behoove us to do anything except what we're doing, ok?
###732 You appear to be losing your objectivity.
###735 If you don't like the way I do things, there's the door. Or better yet, there's the second-storey window.
###750 What is that?  It says "Joolz".
###751 Yeah, well, answer it.
###754 Hello?
###757 Hello?
###759 Jules, what's up?
###763 I lost Grace.  --What? --She was right here and then she disappeared.
###765 Was she captured? No! Oh, dammit!
###770 I didn't lose her.
###771 She meant to ditch me.
###773 If Grace Crandall led Julia to a specific location,
###777 That means they're on to her.
###778 Julia, you got to get out of there NOW! --Higgins.  --Julia??
###792 Something was very wrong.
###794 Where was Miss Crandall?
###797 Was Brackenreid behind this?
###800 What had become of Julia?  Was she in danger?
###805 And if she was in danger here,
###808 what was happening to her in 1899?
###828 "Please hang up and try your call again."
###830 We have to inform the inspector.  --There's no time. We need reinforcements from the station house.
###833 No, we don't. And besides, we know it was Brackenreid who snatched her.
###836 How do we know that?
###838 I just know.
###840 George, we were watching him at the time that Julia was snatched.
###842 Well then, it was one of his cronies. That's a rash assumption.
###846 And it was your rash actions that got her trouble in the first place.
###849 Hitting me isn't going to save her. No, but it might make me feel better.
###854 Brackenreid's on the move!
###861 The cocky bastard!
###879 LEAVE HIM TO ME!
###881 I take the lead. We're of the same rank.
###883 I take charge!
###885 Your methods haven't proven to be successful yet.
###888 Listen, you just shut your mouth ...
###889 ... and watch your back.
###889 Yes, I know.  Hey, hey!
###895 Gentleman, what a surprise!
###897 Detective Julia Ogden has gone missing.
###899 We know you're behind it.
###902 Are you having a laugh, George?
###903 Is he having a giraffe?
###904 I assure you he's being quite serious. Tell us where she is!
###909 You're starting to give me your right arm! Don't make me report your for harassment again. I'll give you something to report!
###914 Allow me an attempt.  Tell us where she is!
###916 That's exactly what I said!
###921 Listen, you two have been watching me for ages. You know better than anyone
###924 that I had nothing to do with your bird's disappearance.
###927 In fact, you two are my alibi!
###929 Well, I can see how upset you both are.
###931 So I'll tell you what. I'll be sure to keep your missing detective in my prayers.
###936 How does that sound?
###941 What do we do?
###942 What do we do?
###944 Well, we have options.
###945 I wasn't talking to you.
###947 The first of which is to contact the station and have them dispatch constables
###950 to comb the area. No.
###953 The deeper I was pulled into this investigation,
###955 the more enchanted I became with this strange, world around me.
###960 Humans, vehicles, information all
###961 moving so fast.  How did one keep up? And who was the George of the future?
###966 He was so hot-tempered and rash. Was this what one had to come to survive
###970 in this modern age?
###972 Would we ever be able to see eye-to-eye?
###974 What are you doing? Get out of my way!
###976 Julia's safety must eclipse any issues you might be having with your superiors.
###980 I'm on suspension right now. Are you happy?
###983 The sheer irresponsibility of continuing to pursue an avenue of investigation
###987 without the support of your superior ...
###990 Oh, of course, because you never break any of the rules!
###992 I try not to. Oh! That's a real shocker!
###994 That's the least of our concerns at the moment. Exactly!  We should be following Brackenreid
###997 instead of you rapping my knuckles here.  Now, get out of my way!
###1001 I don't believe to be the best use of our limited time.
###1005 I don't care what you believe.  Move or be moved.
###1007 I will agree to move if you agree to retrace Grace Crandall's steps.
###1011 I don't do well with ultimatums.
###1013 At the very least
###1014 It will give us Julia's last known whereabouts.
###1017 And then perhaps we can look for trace evidence at the location of her abduction.
###1020 This is not time for reasoning.  I'm going this one alone.
###1024 I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
###1026 Well, I'm afraid you have no choice. You know what, Murdoch?
###1028 I would say that I'm sorry for this, but I'm not.
###1031 Sorry for what? THIS.
###1036 Murdoch!
###1037 Murdoch, are you all right?
###1042 Where is she?  --Who? Julia!  Where is she?
###1044 Doctor Ogden?
###1045 Why are you asking about her?
###1048 I was back in 1899.
###1051 It seemed that George Crabtree had a painful way of making me change
###1054 timelines
###1055 if i was ever anywhere else at all.
###1058 But dream or no dream,
###1060 this wasn't where I needed to be.
###1062 Julia was still missing
###1064 and the Crabtree of the future was out of control.
###1067 Would I be able to get back to 2012
###1070 or was I home for good?
###1085 The ransom drop was a  fiasco, we've got no new leads, Crandall is breathing down our necks ...
###1090 Grace has a gambling problem.
###1092 Dr. Grace?
###1093 No, no. Mr. Crandall's daughter, Emily Grace.
###1096 You mean Grace Crandall. That's what I said.
###1099 Emily Grace is our coroner.
###1100 That's what I said.
###1103 She has a heavy gambling problem and if you find her bookie, you will likely find her.
###1107 And how could you have possibly discovered this?
###1111 It's a long story, Sir.
###1112 It might be worth a look, Sir.
###1115 Fine.  Crabtree, see what you can find, but quickly.
###1117 And you, get some rest.
###1119 I think that knock to the nap left you a bit mixed up.
###1122 Come on, Crabtree.
###1124 Sir, as per your earlier enquiring, Dr. Ogden is attending a fundraiser at the Flatiron. The Flatiron Building!
###1130 That's Brackenreid's pub!
###1132 The inspector owns a pub?
###1134 That's where he's keeping Julia!
###1137 George, I need you to do me a solid.
###1139 A "solid", Sir? Yes, George. I need you to hit me. No, Sir.  I couldn't possibly (do that).
###1144 George you can do it!
###1145 Just like you did by the car!
###1147 The car?
###1148 What car?
###1150 Just like you did it in the park, George. Hit me!
###1153 All right, Sir.  But let it be known, I'm very uncomfortable with this.
###1160 George, do it!
###1164 Oooh!
###1170 It worked!
###1173 I was in 2012 once again.  I knew I had to get to the Flatiron Building
###1177 and fast.
###1180 But I could only hope that I arrived in time.
###1186 George!
###1187 Detective Crabtree!  --Right! Keep your voice down. You're going to ruin everything.
###1191 She's here!  Julia is here! I know.  --You do?
###1194 Have you seen her?
###1196 No, but where else could she be?
###1198 What do you know?
###1199 Oh, uh. Not a thing. Well then how do you know she's here?
###1202 Oh, uh.
###1203 It's just a feeling.
###1205 Well, that doesn't sound like you, but it's good enough for me.
###1207 You know what stinks about this whole thing? What's that?
###1211 There's no way that we couldn't have seen her being brought in here.
###1218 This building was built in the nineteenth century.
###1221 If you say so.
###1222 All buildings were heated with coal back then.
###1224 Fascinating.
###1226 The coal was kept in a dedicated coal room in the basement. Where the pub is!
###1230 That's right.
###1231 If the room still exists, it could likely access the city's sewer system.
###1235 So, if Brackenreid brought her in that way, we wouldn't have seen anything.
###1239 Which would also explain why we didn't see him leave at the time Julia was kidnapped.
###1243 Not bad.
###1244 What kind of a cop knows anything about the nineteenth century?
###1247 Oh, you could say that I have a passing interest in that time period.
###1252 It was my constant challenge to always appear like I belonged here in this time.
###1257 For some reason
###1257 the Flatiron building appeared to be the key to solving a crime in this
###1261 present reality and in my life of the past.
###1265 If that life even still existed.
###1266 Where's your weapon?
###1268 In the armoury? What?  You're not carrying (a gun)?
###1270 Neither are you.
###1271 They won't let me carry a piece since my last suspension. What's your excuse?
###1275 You don't require firearms where I come from to search a building.
###1279 What is this perfect place you come from where no one needs firearms
###1282 and everyone gets along in perfect harmony? Oh, there's plenty of discord, trust me. Discord, yeah right!
###1286 Have you ever done any REAL police work? A lot!
###1292 I assume you have a plan, then? Yeah, I do.
###1296 We wait until the place closes, and then we break in and find Jules.
###1297 I have a better idea.  Oh yeah?  What's that? I'm all ears!
###1301 We kick down the door on three.
###1303 And then what? Well, that's it.  Yeah, I like it! One, two, three!
###1313 I had always been a cautious man.
###1316 but he who hesitates is lost.
###1319 I had hesitated before with Julia, and it cost me her love.
###1324 and I couldn't allow it to cost Julia her life.
###1325 No matter what the consequence to save her,
###1328 I would have kicked down a thousand doors.
###1330 But would I find her on the other side alive?
###1354 Three! Hey, hey!  You'll pay for that!
###1357 Now, where would this secret coal room be? This way!
###1367 Oh, bollocks! Let's see your hands like cop and cowboy. Take it easy, George, my old china?
###1371 Planning a vacation?  --Let me guess. You two are in love.  --Screw you! That's why you faked the kidnapping.
###1376 So your daddy would finance the honeymoon.
###1379 Then you took Jules to keep her from discovering your secret. Not the smartest play.
###1382 That's exactly what I said! Shut up!  All of you!
###1385 Put down your gun!
###1387 Do what I say or she gets it!
###1393 Do you feel fortuitous?
###1395 Well, do you?  Hooligan?
###1404 Why throw these away?
###1406 It seems like such a waste.
###1409 Hey, is he still in there?
###1411 Yes they've been in there for quite some time.
###1413 I just finished the interview with Grace Crandall. Apparently, they were going to skip across
###1417 the border on a train to Buffalo
###1418 and then catch a flight to Fiji.
###1422 What women will do for love.
###1424 Not just women.
###1430 So, I have these two tickets to West Side Story.
###1432 You know, the musical?
###1435 Two kids from opposite sides of the tracks?
###1438 Star-crossed lovers?
###1440 Ah... Shakespeare: Romeo and Juliet
###1443 Yeah.
###1444 Like a less boring version.
###1446 Anyway so,
###1447 if you don't have any plans ... ?  Well?
###1453 No more suspensions, and I got Aunt Daisy back!
###1456 Aunt Daisy?
###1459 Oh my!
###1461 And Brackenreid is finally in jail.
###1463 Congratulations, George.
###1465 Don't call me that!  Just don't.
###1468 Crabtree, grab your phone I want a picture with you two.
###1475 Wait.  Your telephone has a camera inside?
###1478 
###1480 Could it be real?
###1482 A chance to start over with Julia all over again in this strange time?
###1487 Yet I knew I couldn't stay.
###1488 I had to return to find the Grace Crandall of 1899.
###1494 It develops it as well?
###1499 The photo wasn't THAT bad! George.
###1504 How many times!?!
###1506 I need you to do me a favour. Yeah, good luck with that!
###1509 I need you to hit me--HARD.
###1512 Murdoch, I don't want to hit you.
###1514 Hit me, GEORGE!
###1520 Murdoch!  Murdoch!
###1522 Dr. Grace?
###1524 No, no, no.  You don't need a doctor!  Just some ice. Sir, you were right!
###1528 The Crandall girl is heavily in debt and  we haven't been able to find bookmaker yet, though.
###1531 She's not just in debt to him, she's in love with him!
###1533 The two of them were in on the scheme together.
###1535 Now, how could you possibly know that?
###1537 Sir, I believe you'll find them at  Union Station awaiting a train to Buffalo.
###1541 Sir, he hasn't been wrong yet.
###1542 Come on then, Crabtree. Let's go!
###1545 George?  Doctor Ogden? Yes, Sir. She wants to see you. She's very concerned about your injuries.
###1549 She has made me feel quite guilty about it. But she suggests that I apply some cold meat to the side of your face ...
###1552 Crabtree!  I said let's go!
###1559 How are you?
###1560 I heard you sustained a few good blows
###1562 to the head!
###1563 I had quite a dream while I was unconscious.
###1565 May I ask what about?
###1567 I was in a future Toronto.
###1570 It was very
###1571 large and busy!
###1573 Tall buildings filled the sky.
###1576 Airplanes
###1577 soaring through the clouds. It was incredible! It sound glorious!
###1581 But only you could have such a dream!
###1583 William,
###1585 I have two tickets to Romeo and Juliet.
###1588 Perhaps you would like to escort me?
###1590 Oh! Star-crossed lovers!
###1592 How could I not?
###1596 Wisteria Borealis!
###1599 Everything had turned out for the better.
###1601 The case was solved.
###1602 The Crandall girl was safe
###1604 and even here in 1899,
###1605 Julia and I were starting over.
###1608 I might never know if my journey to the future was real,
###1612 but I was happier for it.
###1614 I could not have asked for anything more.
