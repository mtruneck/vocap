0:0:0,45 --> 0:0:2,275
Hey, I'm Ryan Duffy, and
welcome to VICE Today.


3
0:0:2,275 --> 0:0:7,93



4
0:0:7,93 --> 0:0:10,56
On today's episode our resident
office nerd, Thomas


5
0:0:10,56 --> 0:0:12,67
Morton, is going to run you
through his favorite YouTube


6
0:0:12,67 --> 0:0:14,45
videos of all time.


7
0:0:14,45 --> 0:0:16,94
Then Shan's going to take to the
streets to talk to people


8
0:0:16,94 --> 0:0:18,97
about their plans
for summer love.


9
0:0:18,97 --> 0:0:22,655
But first up, Hanson O'Haver, a
weird little house plant who


10
0:0:22,655 --> 0:0:24,71
sits in the corner of our
office, is going to talk to


11
0:0:24,71 --> 0:0:26,71
you about his favorite
rapper of all time.


12
0:0:26,71 --> 0:0:30,38



13
0:0:30,38 --> 0:0:30,67
HANSON O'HAVER: Hey.


14
0:0:30,67 --> 0:0:31,57
I'm Hanson O'Haver.


15
0:0:31,57 --> 0:0:34,8
Welcome to This Week in Drake,
VICE's look at what Drake's


16
0:0:34,8 --> 0:0:35,56
been up to lately.


17
0:0:35,56 --> 0:0:37,15
So there were really
two big pieces of


18
0:0:37,15 --> 0:0:38,21
Drake news this week.


19
0:0:38,21 --> 0:0:41,41
The first is that he announced
a tour that's sort of like a


20
0:0:41,41 --> 0:0:43,83
monsters of blog rap tour.


21
0:0:43,83 --> 0:0:49,87
It's with 2 Chainz, formerly
Tity Boi, J Cole, Waka Flocka


22
0:0:49,87 --> 0:0:52,16
and the geographically
confoundingly


23
0:0:52,16 --> 0:0:55,34
named French Montana.


24
0:0:55,34 --> 0:0:58,1
Personally, I'm not really a big
fan of concerts because I


25
0:0:58,1 --> 0:1:1,48
think all the best Drake songs
are kind of sad and about


26
0:1:1,48 --> 0:1:2,76
being lonely.


27
0:1:2,76 --> 0:1:6,72
I think it's sort of weird to
be 2,000 people in the room


28
0:1:6,72 --> 0:1:8,33
feeling alienated.


29
0:1:8,33 --> 0:1:9,46
The other piece of news.


30
0:1:9,46 --> 0:1:14,22
He was in Miami alongside
Birdman, Lil' Wayne and DJ


31
0:1:14,22 --> 0:1:18,45
Khaled filming a video for
"HYFR." Personally, I think


32
0:1:18,45 --> 0:1:22,35
that "HYFR" is probably one of
the worst songs on Take Care


33
0:1:22,35 --> 0:1:24,98
just because the chorus of "hell
yeah, fucking right" is


34
0:1:24,98 --> 0:1:27,8
really dumb to just repeat
that over and over.


35
0:1:27,8 --> 0:1:29,55
Doesn't really do much for me.


36
0:1:29,55 --> 0:1:32,44
And also because in the song,
Drake and Lil' Wayne talk


37
0:1:32,44 --> 0:1:37,6
about fucking the same girls,
and it's kind of weird.


38
0:1:37,6 --> 0:1:39,3
I just think Lil' Wayne's
sort of gross.


39
0:1:39,3 --> 0:1:42,54
But to be fair to Wayne, I knew
this girl in high school


40
0:1:42,54 --> 0:1:46,8
that moved to LA, and I heard
that she sucked his dick, and


41
0:1:46,8 --> 0:1:48,27
nothing bad happened to her.


42
0:1:48,27 --> 0:1:49,29
She's fine and everything.


43
0:1:49,29 --> 0:1:54,26
So if Drake's cool with that,
more power to Drake.


44
0:1:54,26 --> 0:1:55,89
But anyways, the video's
supposed to


45
0:1:55,89 --> 0:1:57,2
be bar mitzvah themed.


46
0:1:57,2 --> 0:2:0,32
I never got a chance to go to a
bar mitzvah, so I hope that


47
0:2:0,32 --> 0:2:3,29
the video will kind of show
me what that's all about.


48
0:2:3,29 --> 0:2:4,54
Take care.


49
0:2:4,54 --> 0:2:8,199



50
0:2:8,199 --> 0:2:10,41
RYAN DUFFY: So just to recap,
Hanson is legitimately


51
0:2:10,41 --> 0:2:13,27
concerned, like really honest
to God worried, about Lil'


52
0:2:13,27 --> 0:2:14,75
Wayne's STDs.


53
0:2:14,75 --> 0:2:17,71
But he's also excited to learn
about a Jewish rite of passage


54
0:2:17,71 --> 0:2:19,65
via a Drake music video.


55
0:2:19,65 --> 0:2:20,87
So up next we've
got What You're


56
0:2:20,87 --> 0:2:22,92
Watching with Thomas Morton.


57
0:2:22,92 --> 0:2:24,73
I was actually a little worried
about this show


58
0:2:24,73 --> 0:2:28,74
because I feel like Thomas, as
much as I love him, is a bit


59
0:2:28,74 --> 0:2:31,9
of a weirdo, and not many
people understand


60
0:2:31,9 --> 0:2:32,41
his sense of humor.


61
0:2:32,41 --> 0:2:35,34
As it turns out, Thomas is a
complete savant when it comes


62
0:2:35,34 --> 0:2:36,975
to hilarious videos
on YouTube.


63
0:2:36,975 --> 0:2:40,2



64
0:2:40,2 --> 0:2:40,66
THOMAS MORTON: Hi.


65
0:2:40,66 --> 0:2:42,16
Welcome to the VICE offices.


66
0:2:42,16 --> 0:2:44,35
As you can see, everybody here
is doing a very good job


67
0:2:44,35 --> 0:2:45,68
looking busy.


68
0:2:45,68 --> 0:2:47,27
They're all at computers though,
which means what


69
0:2:47,27 --> 0:2:49,81
they're actually doing is
basically what you're doing.


70
0:2:49,81 --> 0:2:51,49
Screwing around on
the internet.


71
0:2:51,49 --> 0:2:53,73
I work on a computer too.


72
0:2:53,73 --> 0:2:56,86
I'm no stranger to
YouTube links.


73
0:2:56,86 --> 0:2:58,78
And so I decided to put together
a few of my favorites


74
0:2:58,78 --> 0:3:0,54
from this week.


75
0:3:0,54 --> 0:3:2,645
Come enjoy the cream
of the crap.


76
0:3:2,645 --> 0:3:7,83



77
0:3:7,83 --> 0:3:10,71
Since it's our first week
together, a way of forging a


78
0:3:10,71 --> 0:3:13,59
little bond of intimacy with us,
I figured instead of doing


79
0:3:13,59 --> 0:3:15,26
the week's round up, I would
kind of dig back into the


80
0:3:15,26 --> 0:3:19,3
personal archives and share with
you five of my, maybe not


81
0:3:19,3 --> 0:3:22,53
all-time favorites, but I think
significant YouTube


82
0:3:22,53 --> 0:3:26,9
clips from my own life.


83
0:3:26,9 --> 0:3:29,41
The first one is completely
self-contained and


84
0:3:29,41 --> 0:3:30,53
self-explanatory.


85
0:3:30,53 --> 0:3:34,84
It's an Asian reporter
going down a slide.

[SHOUTING]


89
0:3:45,99 --> 0:3:49,19
THOMAS MORTON: Look, I'm
not going to try to--


90
0:3:49,19 --> 0:3:51,34
kind of want to make that my
ring tone, to be frank.


91
0:3:51,34 --> 0:3:54,88
The next video is what qualifies
as a griefing video.


92
0:3:54,88 --> 0:3:58,4
It's labeled an epic troll,
which is kind of


93
0:3:58,4 --> 0:3:59,5
like slander and libel.


94
0:3:59,5 --> 0:4:1,37
They're both more or
less the same term.


95
0:4:1,37 --> 0:4:4,42
The audio is piped in, which
makes it even funnier.


96
0:4:4,42 --> 0:4:7,78
And then to emphasize that and
make sure you understand


97
0:4:7,78 --> 0:4:10,8
exactly what swears they're
sputtering,


98
0:4:10,8 --> 0:4:13,516
they've added text.

prick, yeah.

Fucking play the game properly,
you little shit.


102

THOMAS MORTON: As a veteran of
many busted NES controllers


103
0:4:24,59 --> 0:4:29,58
and harsh words to my mom in
other rooms, I think it's not


104
0:4:29,58 --> 0:4:31,91
only par for the course,
but it's kind of


105
0:4:31,91 --> 0:4:33,31
like grunting in tennis.


106
0:4:33,31 --> 0:4:34,6
It gives you--


107
0:4:34,6 --> 0:4:35,606
it helps you play better.


108
0:4:35,606 --> 0:4:35,938
MALE SPEAKER 1: [BRITISH ACCENT]


109
0:4:35,938 --> 0:4:37,35
You stupid prick.


110
0:4:37,35 --> 0:4:41,19
MALE SPEAKER 2: You
fuckin' gay bitch.


111
0:4:41,19 --> 0:4:43,92
THOMAS MORTON: So the deal
with this kid is--


112
0:4:43,92 --> 0:4:46,33
I think it's like a 10-year-old
who has a camera


113
0:4:46,33 --> 0:4:48,8
but probably also autism.


114
0:4:48,8 --> 0:4:51,96
So this is just one video from
this kid who has a whole page


115
0:4:51,96 --> 0:4:54,2
that you should subscribe
to immediately.


116
0:4:54,2 --> 0:4:56,68
Because all his videos
are of--


117
0:4:56,68 --> 0:5:0,71
not of him but of what he sees
through the camera, and then


118
0:5:0,71 --> 0:5:4,1
him talking about the camera
and kind of getting angry


119
0:5:4,1 --> 0:5:7,16
about the camera's occasional
non-functionality.


120
0:5:7,16 --> 0:5:11,18



121
0:5:11,18 --> 0:5:12,22

122
0:5:12,22 --> 0:5:13,755
Can't zoom up on this camera.


123
0:5:13,755 --> 0:5:16,35



124
0:5:16,35 --> 0:5:18,55
Wonder if all these people
have ever heard of


125
0:5:18,55 --> 0:5:19,8
the camera I have.


126
0:5:19,8 --> 0:5:22,39



127
0:5:22,39 --> 0:5:25,27
THOMAS MORTON: This is a little
more cerebral fare.


128
0:5:25,27 --> 0:5:32,19
It's a robotic birth simulator
as being demonstrated by a guy


129
0:5:32,19 --> 0:5:39,1
who has clearly been inside a
countless number of vaginas.


130
0:5:39,1 --> 0:5:43,6
He makes Wilt Chamberlain look
like Tiny Tim, basically.


131
0:5:43,6 --> 0:5:46,2
MALE SPEAKER 4: Often junior
doctors can place the first


132
0:5:46,2 --> 0:5:49,58
blade but have a lot of
difficulties to place the


133
0:5:49,58 --> 0:5:50,39
second blade.


134
0:5:50,39 --> 0:5:52,6
THOMAS MORTON: I cannot believe
this hasn't been taken


135
0:5:52,6 --> 0:5:55,0
down and moved to Redtube yet.


136
0:5:55,0 --> 0:5:56,95

doctor has to go through the


137
0:5:56,95 --> 0:5:59,36
spheres in order to
place the forceps.

THOMAS MORTON: This last clip
was a favorite of our British


140
0:6:5,88 --> 0:6:7,4
office for a while.


141
0:6:7,4 --> 0:6:10,35
I think because all British
people are racist against


142
0:6:10,35 --> 0:6:12,95
every other country in Europe.

suits-- a Eastern European

mother of all K-holes.

try to talk to one, they think

any girl anywhere.

208
0:8:33,26 --> 0:8:34,85

0:8:34,85 --> 0:8:36,559
Tie each other to trees.

0:8:36,559 --> 0:8:37,95
It's all fun and games.


211
0:8:37,95 --> 0:8:39,419
Just don't do it during
hunting season.


212
0:8:39,419 --> 0:8:42,21

while that's happening,

214
0:8:44,42 --> 0:8:46,15
MALE SPEAKER 7: The gunshots
don't bother me.


215
0:8:46,15 --> 0:8:46,94
I'm a gun owner.


216
0:8:46,94 --> 0:8:49,63
SHAN HUANG: How can a girl
catches your eye?

0:8:49,63 --> 0:8:51,14

218
0:8:51,14 --> 0:8:52,98
One girl?


219

Be alone.
