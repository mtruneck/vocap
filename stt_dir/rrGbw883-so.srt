1
0:0:4,276 --> 0:0:7,446
Hey dad, do you know how to calculate
the surface area of a cube?


2
0:0:7,446 --> 0:0:9,582
- Um, oh.


3
0:0:9,582 --> 0:0:11,45
You take the square root
of somebody who knows,


4
0:0:11,45 --> 0:0:12,785
divide it by whatever you tried,


5
0:0:12,785 --> 0:0:14,854
and then ask your mother.


6
0:0:14,854 --> 0:0:16,155
- Ask me what?


7
0:0:16,155 --> 0:0:17,189
- Hey, babe.


8
0:0:17,189 --> 0:0:20,659
- Hmm.


9
0:0:20,659 --> 0:0:21,794
- Something wrong?


10
0:0:21,794 --> 0:0:23,295
- Not a thing.


11
0:0:23,295 --> 0:0:24,897
- You sure?


12
0:0:24,897 --> 0:0:25,931
- I'm fine.


13
0:0:25,931 --> 0:0:29,1
Ask me what?


14
0:0:29,1 --> 0:0:30,936
Is there a reason
you're listening to music


15
0:0:30,936 --> 0:0:32,671
when you're supposed to be studying?


16
0:0:32,671 --> 0:0:33,906
Kevin.


17
0:0:33,906 --> 0:0:35,4
- He can't hear you.


18
0:0:35,4 --> 0:0:39,979
Those are
noise-canceling headphones.


19
0:0:39,979 --> 0:0:41,13
- Oh.


20
0:0:41,13 --> 0:0:41,947
- Ask me what?


21
0:0:41,947 --> 0:0:43,315
- Oh, do you know how to calculate


22
0:0:43,315 --> 0:0:44,683
the surface area of a cube?


23
0:0:44,683 --> 0:0:46,552
- Take the length of one side squared


24
0:0:46,552 --> 0:0:48,2
and multiply it by six.


25
0:0:48,2 --> 0:0:49,121
You didn't know that?


26
0:0:49,121 --> 0:0:51,157
- Whoa, babe, we been
through this before.


27
0:0:51,157 --> 0:0:52,825
Math is not my thing.


28
0:0:52,825 --> 0:0:58,23
If it was, I could figure out
what's wrong with you.


29
0:0:58,23 --> 0:0:59,732
- Kevin, why didn't you ask Lindsey?


30
0:0:59,732 --> 0:1:1,934
She's done this stuff
a lot more recently than I have.


31
0:1:1,934 --> 0:1:2,902
- I don't know.


32
0:1:2,902 --> 0:1:4,303
- Lindsey.


33
0:1:4,303 --> 0:1:5,271
- Yes?


34
0:1:5,271 --> 0:1:6,338
- Did you not see you brother


35
0:1:6,338 --> 0:1:7,54
sitting over here struggling?


36
0:1:7,54 --> 0:1:8,574
- I saw him sitting there.


37
0:1:8,574 --> 0:1:10,42
I didn't know he was struggling.


38
0:1:10,42 --> 0:1:13,779
- Well, since you're so unsure
of what you're looking at,


39
0:1:13,779 --> 0:1:16,615
your job for the next week is
to help Kevin with his homework.


40
0:1:16,615 --> 0:1:18,817
- But mom...
- You want to make it two weeks?


41
0:1:18,817 --> 0:1:21,453
I didn't think so.


42
0:1:21,453 --> 0:1:33,432
Put that up.

44
0:1:38,37 --> 0:1:39,38
- Hey, Gigi.


45
0:1:39,38 --> 0:1:40,139
- Hey, Nick.


46
0:1:40,139 --> 0:1:41,273
- What's wrong with Suzanne?


47
0:1:41,273 --> 0:1:48,113
- Shh.


48
0:1:48,113 --> 0:1:50,983
Okay, your wife, she's upset.


49
0:1:50,983 --> 0:1:51,984
- I can see that.


50
0:1:51,984 --> 0:1:53,986
- Shh, man.


51
0:1:53,986 --> 0:1:55,988
This morning, we had
a breakfast meeting


52
0:1:55,988 --> 0:1:57,79
with a potential client, a woman,


53
0:1:57,79 --> 0:1:59,592
throwing a post honeymoon party.


54
0:1:59,592 --> 0:2:2,294
Suzanne was fine
until the woman asked her


55
0:2:2,294 --> 0:2:3,696
where she went on her honeymoon.


56
0:2:3,696 --> 0:2:7,166
So Suzanne tells her
about this amazing trip


57
0:2:7,166 --> 0:2:10,302
she and you took to Hawaii.


58
0:2:10,302 --> 0:2:13,372
- We didn't go to Hawaii because
we didn't go on a honeymoon.


59
0:2:13,372 --> 0:2:14,873
- That's right.


60
0:2:14,873 --> 0:2:17,209
- Y would Suzanne lie
about going on a honeymoon?


61
0:2:17,209 --> 0:2:18,777
- Why wouldn't she like, Nick?


62
0:2:18,777 --> 0:2:22,514
I mean, you can safely assume
not going on your honeymoon


63
0:2:22,514 --> 0:2:25,417
is like not doing something
that would be really important


64
0:2:25,417 --> 0:2:27,19
to a man that he didn't do


65
0:2:27,19 --> 0:2:29,355
but was around a bunch
of other men who did do it,


66
0:2:29,355 --> 0:2:31,557
and they were talking about it
all the time.


67
0:2:31,557 --> 0:2:34,393
- Gigi, I promised Suzanne
I would take her on a honeymoon,


68
0:2:34,393 --> 0:2:35,628
and I am taking her.


69
0:2:35,628 --> 0:2:37,296
- Then what are you waiting for, Nick?


70
0:2:37,296 --> 0:2:39,665
- I already got one wife.
I don't need you on my back.


71
0:2:39,665 --> 0:2:41,734
- Well, you take her
on that trip or I will.


72
0:2:41,734 --> 0:2:43,235
- Fine, Oprah, you take her.


73
0:2:43,235 --> 0:2:44,837
- Don't mock me.


74
0:2:44,837 --> 0:2:50,75
- I got this, Gigi.


75
0:2:50,75 --> 0:2:51,81
- And what did she say?


76
0:2:51,81 --> 0:2:53,379
And what did you say?


77
0:2:53,379 --> 0:2:55,281
Oh-ho, no!


78
0:2:55,281 --> 0:2:57,149
Oh-ho-ho, no!


79
0:2:57,149 --> 0:2:58,117
Oh-ho!


80
0:2:58,117 --> 0:2:59,118
Did Ralph call you?


81
0:2:59,118 --> 0:3:1,86
Oh-ho, that boy
is on something.


82
0:3:1,86 --> 0:3:2,121
I'm telling you.


83
0:3:2,121 --> 0:3:3,88
No, no.


84
0:3:3,88 --> 0:3:4,423
Him and rere went in.


85
0:3:4,423 --> 0:3:7,92
Oh-ho, they went in.


86
0:3:7,92 --> 0:3:9,261
No, no, you on something, boy.


87
0:3:9,261 --> 0:3:12,298
No, boy, you on something!


88
0:3:12,298 --> 0:3:14,266
No, a'ight, a'ight, check it.


89
0:3:14,266 --> 0:3:15,801
Yeah, I got to do something real quick.


90
0:3:15,801 --> 0:3:17,303
I'll hit you back.
I'll hit you back.


91
0:3:17,303 --> 0:3:19,171
A'ight.


92
0:3:19,171 --> 0:3:20,306
I'm really sorry about that.


93
0:3:20,306 --> 0:3:21,307
That was just...


94
0:3:21,307 --> 0:3:22,441
- Yeah, I know, I know.


95
0:3:22,441 --> 0:3:25,44
It's your boy.
He's on something.


96
0:3:25,44 --> 0:3:26,745
So honeymoon.


97
0:3:26,745 --> 0:3:28,58
Any place in mind?


98
0:3:28,58 --> 0:3:29,782
- Someplace tropical.


99
0:3:29,782 --> 0:3:31,35
- Uh, let's see.


100
0:3:31,35 --> 0:3:32,918
Oh, yeah, here you go.


101
0:3:32,918 --> 0:3:35,287
Let's see.


102
0:3:35,287 --> 0:3:36,689
There we go.


103
0:3:36,689 --> 0:3:38,457
Six nights all inclusive


104
0:3:38,457 --> 0:3:39,925
at the Fiji grand tides.


105
0:3:39,925 --> 0:3:41,193
- Yeah, how much?


106
0:3:41,193 --> 0:3:43,929
- $8,442.


107
0:3:43,929 --> 0:3:46,165
- Boy, you on something.


108
0:3:46,165 --> 0:3:47,833
What can you do for 3,500


109
0:3:47,833 --> 0:3:50,602
broken down into 12 easy payments?


110
0:3:50,602 --> 0:3:51,937
- She like petting zoos?


111
0:3:51,937 --> 0:3:52,938
- No.


112
0:3:52,938 --> 0:3:54,373
- Civil war reenactments?


113
0:3:54,373 --> 0:3:55,708
- No.


114
0:3:55,708 --> 0:3:58,444
Look, I am looking for
a nice romantic beach getaway.


115
0:3:58,444 --> 0:4:1,48
- Right, uh, oh, here, this is you.


116
0:4:1,48 --> 0:4:5,417
All inclusive Maui swimming with
the dolphins honeymoon package,


117
0:4:5,417 --> 0:4:6,852
$1,500.


118
0:4:6,852 --> 0:4:9,54
- Man, what do I look like
swimming with the dolphins?


119
0:4:9,54 --> 0:4:10,723
How am I supposed
to take pictures of that?


120
0:4:10,723 --> 0:4:12,758
This is me.
This is me and a dolphin.


121
0:4:12,758 --> 0:4:14,593
This is me and my wife and a dolphin.


122
0:4:14,593 --> 0:4:15,694
This is me and my wife.


123
0:4:15,694 --> 0:4:17,93
You know who took that picture?
The dolphin.


124
0:4:17,93 --> 0:4:19,431
- No, you got it all wrong.


125
0:4:19,431 --> 0:4:21,4
You don't have to swim
with the dolphins.


126
0:4:21,4 --> 0:4:22,935
You can just sit on the beach.


127
0:4:22,935 --> 0:4:24,2
I'll upgrade your room.


128
0:4:24,2 --> 0:4:26,71
What do you say?


129
0:4:26,71 --> 0:4:27,72
- Book it.


130
0:4:27,72 --> 0:4:28,741
- Great.


131
0:4:28,741 --> 0:4:30,743
Oh, uh, there is one catch.


132
0:4:30,743 --> 0:4:33,445
You have to leave Tuesday.


133
0:4:33,445 --> 0:4:35,114
Tuesday?


134
0:4:35,114 --> 0:4:36,348
As in Tuesday?


135
0:4:36,348 --> 0:4:39,284
- Yeah, Tuesday, this Tuesday.


136
0:4:39,284 --> 0:4:40,853
Oh-ho.


137
0:4:40,853 --> 0:4:43,455
- No. Brad is busy.


138
0:4:43,455 --> 0:4:44,59
Who is this?


139
0:4:44,59 --> 0:4:45,591
Rere?


140
0:4:45,591 --> 0:4:48,16
- Oh-ho-ho, rere went in.


141
0:4:48,16 --> 0:4:53,42
I call you back, Shawty.


142
0:4:53,42 --> 0:4:54,677
- Nick.


143
0:4:54,677 --> 0:4:56,45
Honey.


144
0:4:56,45 --> 0:4:58,982
Babe, can you please help me
zip up my dress?


145
0:4:58,982 --> 0:5:1,384
- Oh, no problem.


146
0:5:1,384 --> 0:5:2,418
There you go.


147
0:5:2,418 --> 0:5:3,92
- Thank you.


148
0:5:3,92 --> 0:5:5,822
- Babe?
- Huh? Yes?


149
0:5:5,822 --> 0:5:7,557
- You seem a little out of sorts.


150
0:5:7,557 --> 0:5:9,292
Is everything okay?


151
0:5:9,292 --> 0:5:10,693
- Yes, I'm fine.


152
0:5:10,693 --> 0:5:13,463
Um, I was heaving a problem
with a client.


153
0:5:13,463 --> 0:5:14,664
- You sure?


154
0:5:14,664 --> 0:5:15,832
- Yeah, I'm good.


155
0:5:15,832 --> 0:5:18,668
Thank you for asking.


156
0:5:18,668 --> 0:5:19,702
- Ooh, I got to get this.


157
0:5:19,702 --> 0:5:20,87
- Okay.


158
0:5:20,87 --> 0:5:21,871
Kevin.


159
0:5:21,871 --> 0:5:23,173
- Yes.


160
0:5:23,173 --> 0:5:24,908
- Did Lindsey help you
with your homework?


161
0:5:24,908 --> 0:5:26,142
- Uh, she...


162
0:5:26,142 --> 0:5:27,577
- Yes.
- Yes.


163
0:5:27,577 --> 0:5:28,578
She... mm-Hmm.


164
0:5:28,578 --> 0:5:29,612
We did...


165
0:5:29,612 --> 0:5:31,581
- We did geography and his vocabulary,


166
0:5:31,581 --> 0:5:34,15
and we did the make-up questions
on a quiz he failed.


167
0:5:34,15 --> 0:5:35,919
- What quiz did you fail?


168
0:5:35,919 --> 0:5:37,2
- It was a hard quiz, mom.


169
0:5:37,2 --> 0:5:38,922
And, plus, I didn't really fail fail.


170
0:5:38,922 --> 0:5:40,623
I just missed a lot of the answers,


171
0:5:40,623 --> 0:5:43,59
and we corrected them,
so I'm getting a "b."


172
0:5:43,59 --> 0:5:46,563
- A "b" as in, boy, you better
not bring home another "f?"


173
0:5:46,563 --> 0:5:48,198
- Yep, that's the one.
That's the one.


174
0:5:48,198 --> 0:5:49,332
- Okay.


175
0:5:49,332 --> 0:5:50,366
Yeah.


176
0:5:50,366 --> 0:5:51,334
Love you guys.


177
0:5:51,334 --> 0:5:52,335
- Bye, mommy.


178
0:5:52,335 --> 0:5:53,403
- Hey.
- Hey.


179
0:5:53,403 --> 0:5:54,404
- Hi.


180
0:5:54,404 --> 0:5:55,371
Bye.


181
0:5:55,371 --> 0:5:57,807
Bye.


182
0:5:57,807 --> 0:6:0,843
So you know that cute guy
at the coffee shop?


183
0:6:0,843 --> 0:6:3,79
- The one who always gives you
the next size up?


184
0:6:3,79 --> 0:6:4,38
- Right.
- Mm-Hmm.


185
0:6:4,38 --> 0:6:5,615
- He asked me out.


186
0:6:5,615 --> 0:6:6,583
- And what did you say?


187
0:6:6,583 --> 0:6:7,85
- I said I'd think about it.


188
0:6:7,85 --> 0:6:10,286
- Okay, instead of saying
you'd think about it,


189
0:6:10,286 --> 0:6:12,322
why didn't you just tell him no?


190
0:6:12,322 --> 0:6:14,19
- Because by my calculations,


191
0:6:14,19 --> 0:6:16,993
at five visits a week,
say, over 48 weeks,


192
0:6:16,993 --> 0:6:19,862
at 90¢ per up size times two,


193
0:6:19,862 --> 0:6:22,332
that's about 450 bucks a year.


194
0:6:22,332 --> 0:6:25,268
And I spend that little extra
money to help me look like this


195
0:6:25,268 --> 0:6:27,67
so I can get free coffee.


196
0:6:27,67 --> 0:6:29,672
- Why don't you just spend it
on coffee?


197
0:6:29,672 --> 0:6:33,109
- And not look like this?


198
0:6:33,109 --> 0:6:34,344
- Wow.


199
0:6:34,344 --> 0:6:36,79
- Thank you.


200
0:6:36,79 --> 0:6:37,18
- What are you talking about?


201
0:6:37,18 --> 0:6:38,514
- Uh, never mind, honey.


202
0:6:38,514 --> 0:6:39,716
What is it?


203
0:6:39,716 --> 0:6:42,652
- Well, you might
be interested in knowing


204
0:6:42,652 --> 0:6:45,855
that your boy,
Mr. Nick Kingston-persons,


205
0:6:45,855 --> 0:6:48,57
has secured an interview with the one,


206
0:6:48,57 --> 0:6:51,995
the only Ms. Laila Ali.


207
0:6:51,995 --> 0:6:57,1
- What?


208
0:6:57,1 --> 0:6:58,468
- Honey, honey, come on.


209
0:6:58,468 --> 0:7:0,3
Okay, stop, stop.


210
0:7:0,3 --> 0:7:1,638
Babe, babe.


211
0:7:1,638 --> 0:7:2,672
That's fantastic,


212
0:7:2,672 --> 0:7:4,34
but please don't do that
in front of her.


213
0:7:4,34 --> 0:7:7,577
The lady might have
a flashback and knock you out.


214
0:7:7,577 --> 0:7:8,678
Wow.


215
0:7:8,678 --> 0:7:9,979
Laila Ali.


216
0:7:9,979 --> 0:7:10,913
Nick.


217
0:7:10,913 --> 0:7:12,48
- No.
- Suzanne.


218
0:7:12,48 --> 0:7:13,349
- Nick.
- What?


219
0:7:13,349 --> 0:7:16,352
- Can you please get her
to sign my boxing gloves?


220
0:7:16,352 --> 0:7:17,42
Please.


221
0:7:17,42 --> 0:7:18,888
- I'll see what I can do.


222
0:7:18,888 --> 0:7:20,156
- Thank you.


223
0:7:20,156 --> 0:7:21,958
- Honey, how did this come about?


224
0:7:21,958 --> 0:7:23,76
Laila Ali, that's a big deal.


225
0:7:23,76 --> 0:7:25,194
- Yeah, it's a big deal.


226
0:7:25,194 --> 0:7:27,23
She has a speaking engagement
in Hawaii next week,


227
0:7:27,23 --> 0:7:28,831
and they needed somebody this week.


228
0:7:28,831 --> 0:7:29,966
- Wow.


229
0:7:29,966 --> 0:7:32,201
Must be nice to work in Hawaii.


230
0:7:32,201 --> 0:7:34,304
- Yeah, I wish I was going to Hawaii.


231
0:7:34,304 --> 0:7:36,306
They got me going
to pebble beach next week.


232
0:7:36,306 --> 0:7:37,774
- Oh, really?
What for?


233
0:7:37,774 --> 0:7:39,742
- Local guy in the pro-am.


234
0:7:39,742 --> 0:7:40,943
I'm working on a profile.


235
0:7:40,943 --> 0:7:41,978
- All right.


236
0:7:41,978 --> 0:7:43,479
Well, honey, we got to go.


237
0:7:43,479 --> 0:7:44,847
I love you.
I'll see you later.


238
0:7:44,847 --> 0:7:46,349
- Okay, baby.
- Bye.


239
0:7:46,349 --> 0:7:47,45
- Uh, Gigi?


240
0:7:47,45 --> 0:7:48,518
- What?


241
0:7:48,518 --> 0:7:49,585
- When can I get those gloves?


242
0:7:49,585 --> 0:7:51,22
- Oh, so I'll see you out there, okay?


243
0:7:51,22 --> 0:7:53,356
- Okay.
- Um, tonight.


244
0:7:53,356 --> 0:7:56,125
And can you also get her
holding my gloves


245
0:7:56,125 --> 0:7:57,16
and take a picture.


246
0:7:57,16 --> 0:7:59,329
- Gigi, enough about the gloves.


247
0:7:59,329 --> 0:8:0,496
Listen.


248
0:8:0,496 --> 0:8:4,2
What I am about to tell you,
you cannot say anything.


249
0:8:4,2 --> 0:8:7,337
And by anything, I mean nothing.


250
0:8:7,337 --> 0:8:9,772
You cannot discuss
what I'm about to tell you


251
0:8:9,772 --> 0:8:11,174
with anyone but me.


252
0:8:11,174 --> 0:8:13,576
- Nick, Suzanne is my best friend.


253
0:8:13,576 --> 0:8:16,112
I... I can't have
no secrets with her husband.


254
0:8:16,112 --> 0:8:17,347
- Gigi.
- What?


255
0:8:17,347 --> 0:8:22,185
- I'm taking Suzanne on a honeymoon.


256
0:8:22,185 --> 0:8:23,152
- When?


257
0:8:23,152 --> 0:8:24,187
- That's the thing.


258
0:8:24,187 --> 0:8:25,388
It has to be next week.


259
0:8:25,388 --> 0:8:27,69
- But you just said you're going
to pebble beach next week.


260
0:8:27,69 --> 0:8:28,858
- I'm not. I lied.


261
0:8:28,858 --> 0:8:30,93
- Ooh.


262
0:8:30,93 --> 0:8:31,994
- Listen, I need her
to think that I'm traveling


263
0:8:31,994 --> 0:8:33,963
so she doesn't make plans
for me to be here


264
0:8:33,963 --> 0:8:36,599
that I can't get out of.


265
0:8:36,599 --> 0:8:38,601
- Nick, why are you telling me this?


266
0:8:38,601 --> 0:8:40,47
You know I can't hold no secrets.


267
0:8:40,47 --> 0:8:41,871
- I need you to clear her calendar.


268
0:8:41,871 --> 0:8:43,72
- It's gonna be tough.


269
0:8:43,72 --> 0:8:44,774
- What? She's got
a lot of appointments?


270
0:8:44,774 --> 0:8:47,143
- No, I wrote everything in pen.


271
0:8:47,143 --> 0:8:48,611
- Gigi.
- What?


272
0:8:48,611 --> 0:8:52,281
Okay, okay, I'll see what I can do.


273
0:8:52,281 --> 0:8:53,282
I got to go.


274
0:8:53,282 --> 0:8:55,17
- Gigi.
- What?


275
0:8:55,17 --> 0:8:56,886
- Not a word.


276
0:8:56,886 --> 0:9:0,56
Or I will kill you.


277
0:9:0,56 --> 0:9:12,535
You... wow, you're serious.


278
0:9:12,535 --> 0:9:15,838
- You know, ma, I don't ask for much.


279
0:9:15,838 --> 0:9:17,573
It's only five nights.


280
0:9:17,573 --> 0:9:18,975
- And six days.


281
0:9:18,975 --> 0:9:20,343
And you think you gonna sucker me


282
0:9:20,343 --> 0:9:21,711
into staying here with those kids


283
0:9:21,711 --> 0:9:23,613
by making me a sandwich?


284
0:9:23,613 --> 0:9:25,681
- That is not just a sandwich.


285
0:9:25,681 --> 0:9:27,617
That is hand-cut,


286
0:9:27,617 --> 0:9:30,553
honey-roasted,
free range Turkey,


287
0:9:30,553 --> 0:9:32,889
with cave-aged gouda cheese,


288
0:9:32,889 --> 0:9:36,459
resting on seven grain
organic wheat bread.


289
0:9:36,459 --> 0:9:39,128
No, man, that is not just a sandwich.


290
0:9:39,128 --> 0:9:43,199
That is an experience.


291
0:9:43,199 --> 0:9:44,634
Come on, ma.


292
0:9:44,634 --> 0:9:49,305
Look at this place.


293
0:9:49,305 --> 0:9:52,41
- Ooh, that is nice.


294
0:9:52,41 --> 0:9:53,543
Is this the part where you hit me up


295
0:9:53,543 --> 0:9:55,344
for the money to help with the deposit?


296
0:9:55,344 --> 0:9:58,614
- No, ma, I just need
your help with the kids.


297
0:9:58,614 --> 0:10:0,383
- Can I just give you the money?


298
0:10:0,383 --> 0:10:1,717
I'll tell you what I'll do.


299
0:10:1,717 --> 0:10:3,92
I will stay here with those kids


300
0:10:3,92 --> 0:10:5,721
if you promise me
that while you're there,


301
0:10:5,721 --> 0:10:7,523
you'll take Suzanne
on one of those boat rides


302
0:10:7,523 --> 0:10:9,559
that I hear white men
take their wives on.


303
0:10:9,559 --> 0:10:10,793
- What kind is that?


304
0:10:10,793 --> 0:10:13,83
- The kind where the wives
don't come back.


305
0:10:13,83 --> 0:10:14,797
Get it?


306
0:10:14,797 --> 0:10:21,545
Ooh, I tickle me.


307
0:10:21,545 --> 0:10:22,546
Almost there.


308
0:10:22,546 --> 0:10:24,648
Uh. Whoa, replay!


309
0:10:24,648 --> 0:10:26,15
Ha-ha!


310
0:10:26,15 --> 0:10:27,484
- Kevin, come on.


311
0:10:27,484 --> 0:10:29,353
I really want to hook up
with my friends.


312
0:10:29,353 --> 0:10:31,221
I'm supposed to be helping you
with this essay,


313
0:10:31,221 --> 0:10:32,356
not doing it for you.


314
0:10:32,356 --> 0:10:33,891
- I'm only gonna be a few more minutes.


315
0:10:33,891 --> 0:10:35,59
What's wrong with it anyway?


316
0:10:35,59 --> 0:10:36,36
- What's wrong with it?


317
0:10:36,36 --> 0:10:38,462
That's the stupidest essay
I've ever read.


318
0:10:38,462 --> 0:10:40,464
Do you even know anything
about Barack Obama?


319
0:10:40,464 --> 0:10:42,333
- If you hate it so much, you write it.


320
0:10:42,333 --> 0:10:43,334
- Why would I do that?


321
0:10:43,334 --> 0:10:44,935
- You're the one with friends waiting.


322
0:10:44,935 --> 0:10:45,903
I got all night.


323
0:10:45,903 --> 0:10:47,171
- Fine.
- Awesome.


324
0:10:47,171 --> 0:10:48,872
So if you could get that
to me about 7:00,


325
0:10:48,872 --> 0:10:49,94
8:00 at the latest.


326
0:10:49,94 --> 0:10:55,179
- Oh, it'll be here.


327
0:10:55,179 --> 0:10:57,47
- You should have it in a little while.


328
0:10:57,47 --> 0:10:58,315
Okay, you're welcome.


329
0:10:58,315 --> 0:11:0,351
B'bye.


330
0:11:0,351 --> 0:11:3,42
Okay.


331
0:11:3,42 --> 0:11:7,791
Maui emerald shores?


332
0:11:7,791 --> 0:11:16,133
Six days, five nights,
Kingston-persons?


333
0:11:16,133 --> 0:11:17,601
Hello?


334
0:11:17,601 --> 0:11:21,405
Um, yes, I'm calling
to confirm a reservation.


335
0:11:21,405 --> 0:11:22,606
Sure.


336
0:11:22,606 --> 0:11:26,43
Nick Kingston-persons.


337
0:11:26,43 --> 0:11:27,144
Thank you.


338
0:11:27,144 --> 0:11:29,213
Yes, no, I just wanted to make sure


339
0:11:29,213 --> 0:11:31,949
that it was a king non-smoking.


340
0:11:31,949 --> 0:11:33,851
Upgraded to a sweet?


341
0:11:33,851 --> 0:11:35,819
For two?


342
0:11:35,819 --> 0:11:39,857
Oh, and it's part of the swim
with the dolphins package?


343
0:11:39,857 --> 0:11:42,426
Right, next Tuesday through Saturday.


344
0:11:42,426 --> 0:11:43,727
Thank you.


345
0:11:43,727 --> 0:11:56,507
Yeah, you have a good day too.


346
0:11:56,507 --> 0:11:57,474
Hello?


347
0:11:57,474 --> 0:11:59,51
- Hey, can I please speak with Nick?


348
0:11:59,51 --> 0:12:0,644
- Who's this?


349
0:12:0,644 --> 0:12:2,279
- Uh, this is Skinner from the office.


350
0:12:2,279 --> 0:12:3,847
I just wanted to let Nick now


351
0:12:3,847 --> 0:12:5,783
that we're gonna take
Palmer off pebble beach


352
0:12:5,783 --> 0:12:7,918
and do it next week with him instead.


353
0:12:7,918 --> 0:12:10,87
So if he can check his schedule
and get back to me,


354
0:12:10,87 --> 0:12:12,189
I'd greatly appreciate it.


355
0:12:12,189 --> 0:12:15,592
- So Nick wasn't on
the pebble beach assignment?


356
0:12:15,592 --> 0:12:17,294
- Well, he wasn't, but he is now.


357
0:12:17,294 --> 0:12:18,829
- And it's next week?


358
0:12:18,829 --> 0:12:19,997
- Right.


359
0:12:19,997 --> 0:12:21,765
- And who are you calling for?


360
0:12:21,765 --> 0:12:23,7
- Nick Kingston-persons.


361
0:12:23,7 --> 0:12:24,835
- D you are?


362
0:12:24,835 --> 0:12:25,869
- This is Skinner.


363
0:12:25,869 --> 0:12:27,471
- From the office?
- Yes.


364
0:12:27,471 --> 0:12:29,273
- Who's office?
- What?


365
0:12:29,273 --> 0:12:30,34
- No, uh, I'm sorry.


366
0:12:30,34 --> 0:12:35,379
Never mind.
B'bye. Thank you.


367
0:12:35,379 --> 0:12:37,448
- Suzanne, that is ridiculous.


368
0:12:37,448 --> 0:12:39,917
Nick is not having an affair.


369
0:12:39,917 --> 0:12:41,552
- Gigi, I'm not stupid.


370
0:12:41,552 --> 0:12:44,621
He said he was going
to pebble beach next week,


371
0:12:44,621 --> 0:12:47,458
and instead I find
a reservation to Maui.


372
0:12:47,458 --> 0:12:48,459
- Maui?


373
0:12:48,459 --> 0:12:49,96
- Maui.
- Maui?


374
0:12:49,96 --> 0:12:51,128
- Yes.
- Hawaii?


375
0:12:51,128 --> 0:12:53,363
- Yes.
- That is amazing.


376
0:12:53,363 --> 0:12:54,932
- Right?


377
0:12:54,932 --> 0:12:57,367
And then I find out
that it's a king suite.


378
0:12:57,367 --> 0:12:58,836
- King suite?


379
0:12:58,836 --> 0:13:0,3
- King suite.


380
0:13:0,3 --> 0:13:1,138
- Mm.


381
0:13:1,138 --> 0:13:3,173
- I mean, isn't that crazy?


382
0:13:3,173 --> 0:13:4,208
- Crazy.


383
0:13:4,208 --> 0:13:5,409
- And then I find out


384
0:13:5,409 --> 0:13:6,777
that he was never even going


385
0:13:6,777 --> 0:13:8,979
on this alleged
pebble beach assignment.


386
0:13:8,979 --> 0:13:10,38
- You know what?


387
0:13:10,38 --> 0:13:13,283
I refuse to believe your husband
is cheating on you.


388
0:13:13,283 --> 0:13:14,985
- Well, you don't have to believe it.


389
0:13:14,985 --> 0:13:15,986
- Well, you know what?


390
0:13:15,986 --> 0:13:18,322
Maybe someone stole his credit card


391
0:13:18,322 --> 0:13:21,158
and put the room under his name.


392
0:13:21,158 --> 0:13:24,862
Yeah, I mean, identity theft is real.


393
0:13:24,862 --> 0:13:26,29
- So what?


394
0:13:26,29 --> 0:13:27,698
So they broke into our house,


395
0:13:27,698 --> 0:13:29,32
used our computer,


396
0:13:29,32 --> 0:13:30,267
booked the reservation,


397
0:13:30,267 --> 0:13:32,302
and had the confirmation email
sent to his address


398
0:13:32,302 --> 0:13:33,871
so he would never find out about it?


399
0:13:33,871 --> 0:13:35,906
- I didn't say they were good at it.


400
0:13:35,906 --> 0:13:37,174
- Gigi.
- What?


401
0:13:37,174 --> 0:13:38,942
- Why are you defending him?


402
0:13:38,942 --> 0:13:40,744
Do you know something I don't?


403
0:13:40,744 --> 0:13:42,146
- Do... no.


404
0:13:42,146 --> 0:13:44,882
I mean, do I know... how can you
ask me do I know something?


405
0:13:44,882 --> 0:13:46,45
Have I ever known anything?


406
0:13:46,45 --> 0:13:49,453
- Well, if you knew something,
you would tell me, right?


407
0:13:49,453 --> 0:13:51,121
I mean, you have to tell me.


408
0:13:51,121 --> 0:13:53,423
- You are insulting me right now.


409
0:13:53,423 --> 0:13:55,125
Because, girl, you know
if I knew something


410
0:13:55,125 --> 0:13:56,527
that I knew you needed to know,


411
0:13:56,527 --> 0:13:58,629
and you didn't know and I knew
you needed to know that,


412
0:13:58,629 --> 0:13:59,796
girl, you know me.


413
0:13:59,796 --> 0:14:1,899
When have I ever not
told you something.


414
0:14:1,899 --> 0:14:2,933
- Never.


415
0:14:2,933 --> 0:14:4,268
- Right.


416
0:14:4,268 --> 0:14:5,769
So don't be questioning our friendship


417
0:14:5,769 --> 0:14:8,238
over some obvious misunderstanding,


418
0:14:8,238 --> 0:14:10,974
which I'm sure will be explained
to your satisfaction,


419
0:14:10,974 --> 0:14:13,777
sooner rather than later.


420
0:14:13,777 --> 0:14:15,145
- I'm not waiting for later.


421
0:14:15,145 --> 0:14:16,713
- Where are you going?


422
0:14:16,713 --> 0:14:19,783
- To find out if I need
to check Nick into a rehab.


423
0:14:19,783 --> 0:14:21,852
- Go do what you got to do.


424
0:14:21,852 --> 0:14:28,292
Just don't mention my name.


425
0:14:28,292 --> 0:14:29,826
- Is there a particular fighter


426
0:14:29,826 --> 0:14:31,495
you've had a problem with in the ring?


427
0:14:31,495 --> 0:14:32,863
- You know what, I believe


428
0:14:32,863 --> 0:14:34,932
that if you have a problem
with a fighter in the ring,


429
0:14:34,932 --> 0:14:36,133
then you had a problem with your skills


430
0:14:36,133 --> 0:14:37,334
before she even showed up.


431
0:14:37,334 --> 0:14:39,303
So what I would do
is analyze my own weaknesses,


432
0:14:39,303 --> 0:14:41,138
figure out how someone
was gonna try to beat me,


433
0:14:41,138 --> 0:14:42,673
and then I wouldn't let it happen.


434
0:14:42,673 --> 0:14:45,876
- Wait.
Not one problem with anybody?


435
0:14:45,876 --> 0:14:47,644
Like, Jackie Frazier?


436
0:14:47,644 --> 0:14:48,579
- Oh, you know what?


437
0:14:48,579 --> 0:14:49,813
Don't even start bringing up


438
0:14:49,813 --> 0:14:50,914
them damn fraziers, okay,


439
0:14:50,914 --> 0:14:52,449
or I'm gonna have a problem with you.


440
0:14:52,449 --> 0:14:53,617
Next thing you'll be asking me


441
0:14:53,617 --> 0:14:54,718
if Rita foreman has a cookbook,


442
0:14:54,718 --> 0:14:56,486
you know, when her daddy
got all them grills.


443
0:14:56,486 --> 0:14:58,989
- Okay, okay, backing off, backing off.


444
0:14:58,989 --> 0:15:0,39
- Back on up, now.


445
0:15:0,39 --> 0:15:2,693
- You are the Beyonce of boxing.


446
0:15:2,693 --> 0:15:4,628
You got your own clothing line,


447
0:15:4,628 --> 0:15:7,564
cosmetics, fragrances,
line of skillets,


448
0:15:7,564 --> 0:15:9,466
jeans, workout tapes.


449
0:15:9,466 --> 0:15:12,202
So what's next for laila Ali, sleep?


450
0:15:12,202 --> 0:15:13,737
- No, ma'am, you cannot come in here.


451
0:15:13,737 --> 0:15:14,738
We're shooting.


452
0:15:14,738 --> 0:15:16,273
- Oh, no, they ain't shooting.


453
0:15:16,273 --> 0:15:18,542
I'm the one that's about to be
shooting, though, for real.


454
0:15:18,542 --> 0:15:19,71
- Babe, what are you doing here?


455
0:15:19,71 --> 0:15:20,711
- Don't "babe" me.


456
0:15:20,711 --> 0:15:22,246
Sit down.


457
0:15:22,246 --> 0:15:23,313
Is this her?


458
0:15:23,313 --> 0:15:24,314
- Her who?


459
0:15:24,314 --> 0:15:25,749
Baby, this is laila Ali.


460
0:15:25,749 --> 0:15:26,817
- Oh, I know who she is.


461
0:15:26,817 --> 0:15:30,754
Stand up.


462
0:15:30,754 --> 0:15:32,723
Oh, no.


463
0:15:32,723 --> 0:15:33,757
Come on, man.


464
0:15:33,757 --> 0:15:35,58
Are you kidding me?


465
0:15:35,58 --> 0:15:37,227
So what, you gonna take
your little boxing baby mama


466
0:15:37,227 --> 0:15:39,363
to Hawaii and try and hide
the baby from me?


467
0:15:39,363 --> 0:15:40,731
- Whoa, whoa, wait, you know what?


468
0:15:40,731 --> 0:15:41,932
Listen here, little chick.


469
0:15:41,932 --> 0:15:44,1
I don't know who you are
or what this is about,


470
0:15:44,1 --> 0:15:45,902
but if you call me out
my name one more time,


471
0:15:45,902 --> 0:15:47,4
I'm gonna smack you.


472
0:15:47,4 --> 0:15:48,472
Okay, I don't care if you are little.


473
0:15:48,472 --> 0:15:49,873
- And I don't care if you are big.


474
0:15:49,873 --> 0:15:52,75
I may only hit you once,
but it's gonna be hard.


475
0:15:52,75 --> 0:15:53,81
- Suzanne, have you lost your mind?


476
0:15:53,81 --> 0:15:54,978
She is pregnant.


477
0:15:54,978 --> 0:15:55,879
- Oh, whatever.


478
0:15:55,879 --> 0:15:57,47
- You know what?
Let her try.


479
0:15:57,47 --> 0:16:0,5
Me and this baby
will knock her little butt out.


480
0:16:0,5 --> 0:16:1,51
- Laila, laila, please.


481
0:16:1,51 --> 0:16:2,386
Please, let me handle this.


482
0:16:2,386 --> 0:16:3,387
Don't hurt her.


483
0:16:3,387 --> 0:16:5,656
- Are you seriously gonna stand there


484
0:16:5,656 --> 0:16:7,157
and protect her over me?


485
0:16:7,157 --> 0:16:8,258
Hell naw.


486
0:16:8,258 --> 0:16:9,493
You know what? Sit down.


487
0:16:9,493 --> 0:16:11,895
And don't you move.


488
0:16:11,895 --> 0:16:13,163
Let me tell you something.


489
0:16:13,163 --> 0:16:15,666
You need to explain yourself.


490
0:16:15,666 --> 0:16:21,638
- Lady, if you don't take
your finger out my neck...


491
0:16:21,638 --> 0:16:23,73
- Okay, explain yourself.


492
0:16:23,73 --> 0:16:25,776
Why is my man going to Hawaii


493
0:16:25,776 --> 0:16:26,977
with y'all, laila, Ali?


494
0:16:26,977 --> 0:16:28,11
- What?
- Huh?


495
0:16:28,11 --> 0:16:29,279
- You know what?
You're crazy.


496
0:16:29,279 --> 0:16:30,447
I'm gonna go ahead and go,


497
0:16:30,447 --> 0:16:31,748
because if I stay, I'm gonna have


498
0:16:31,748 --> 0:16:33,75
to bop your wife
on the top of the head.


499
0:16:33,75 --> 0:16:35,252
- Laila, laila, no, no.


500
0:16:35,252 --> 0:16:37,54
Laila, no, please.


501
0:16:37,54 --> 0:16:38,55
- Go ahead. Go ahead.


502
0:16:38,55 --> 0:16:40,357
- Suzanne!
Whoa, whoa, this is crazy!


503
0:16:40,357 --> 0:16:43,93
- You know what? Don't try
to play dumb, Nick, okay?


504
0:16:43,93 --> 0:16:44,895
I saw your trip to Maui.


505
0:16:44,895 --> 0:16:47,64
You said you were going
to pebble beach.


506
0:16:47,64 --> 0:16:49,766
- I lied about that.


507
0:16:49,766 --> 0:16:53,904
- Okay, so finally we get to the truth.


508
0:16:53,904 --> 0:16:55,138
You know what, Nick?


509
0:16:55,138 --> 0:16:57,207
I've had my heart broken before,


510
0:16:57,207 --> 0:16:58,475
so now it's your turn.


511
0:16:58,475 --> 0:16:59,71
So why don't you tell me?


512
0:16:59,71 --> 0:17:4,548
Are you going to Hawaii
with laila or somebody else?


513
0:17:4,548 --> 0:17:8,852
- Somebody else.


514
0:17:8,852 --> 0:17:10,12
- Fine.


515
0:17:10,12 --> 0:17:13,957
You know what?
Who is it? What's her name?


516
0:17:13,957 --> 0:17:16,326
- Suzanne.


517
0:17:16,326 --> 0:17:19,73
- Just tell me, okay?


518
0:17:19,73 --> 0:17:20,897
- Suzanne.


519
0:17:20,897 --> 0:17:22,65
- Suzanne?


520
0:17:22,65 --> 0:17:24,201
Her name is Suzanne, Nick?


521
0:17:24,201 --> 0:17:25,202
What?


522
0:17:25,202 --> 0:17:26,269
- It's you.


523
0:17:26,269 --> 0:17:27,804
Look, look, I'm taking you to Hawaii.


524
0:17:27,804 --> 0:17:29,506
Damn, I was trying to be clever.


525
0:17:29,506 --> 0:17:30,974
- What do you mean, you're taking me?


526
0:17:30,974 --> 0:17:33,176
Now is not the time to be clever, Nick.


527
0:17:33,176 --> 0:17:34,544
I'm about to shoot you.


528
0:17:34,544 --> 0:17:35,879
- Whoa, whoa, baby, baby.


529
0:17:35,879 --> 0:17:37,948
Whoa, hey, okay, look.


530
0:17:37,948 --> 0:17:39,75
It was our honeymoon.


531
0:17:39,75 --> 0:17:41,351
I'm taking you on a honeymoon.


532
0:17:41,351 --> 0:17:42,719
It was supposed to be a surprise.


533
0:17:42,719 --> 0:17:44,755
Give me the gun.


534
0:17:44,755 --> 0:17:45,756
- Hawaii?


535
0:17:45,756 --> 0:17:46,99
Are you serious?


536
0:17:46,99 --> 0:17:48,191
- Yes.


537
0:17:48,191 --> 0:17:49,359
How did you find out?


538
0:17:49,359 --> 0:17:50,594
Did Gigi say something?


539
0:17:50,594 --> 0:17:51,728
- No.


540
0:17:51,728 --> 0:17:53,397
Honey, it was on your computer.


541
0:17:53,397 --> 0:17:54,498
I saw it at the house.


542
0:17:54,498 --> 0:17:55,966
Gigi knew about this?


543
0:17:55,966 --> 0:17:59,736
- I needed her to clear
your schedule, baby.


544
0:17:59,736 --> 0:18:1,505
- Honey, get up, get up.


545
0:18:1,505 --> 0:18:2,506
Mm.


546
0:18:2,506 --> 0:18:3,774
Oh, oh, I love you.


547
0:18:3,774 --> 0:18:5,475
I'm so sorry.


548
0:18:5,475 --> 0:18:6,61
Oh, my God.


549
0:18:6,61 --> 0:18:7,778
Laila.


550
0:18:7,778 --> 0:18:9,546
Ms. Ali.


551
0:18:9,546 --> 0:18:10,881
I am so sorry.


552
0:18:10,881 --> 0:18:15,652
I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.


553
0:18:15,652 --> 0:18:17,487
Well, I guess it's okay.


554
0:18:17,487 --> 0:18:20,223
Can't get mad at a woman
for coming after her man.


555
0:18:20,223 --> 0:18:24,327
But you know you did almost
get knocked out.


556
0:18:24,327 --> 0:18:25,429
You still have that gun?


557
0:18:25,429 --> 0:18:26,663
- Mm-mm.
- It's right here.


558
0:18:26,663 --> 0:18:27,664
Don't worry about it.


559
0:18:27,664 --> 0:18:29,132
- Oh, okay.


560
0:18:29,132 --> 0:18:33,737
If she makes one move, you hit
her as hard as you can, okay?


561
0:18:33,737 --> 0:18:36,6
- All right, um, let's pick it up.


562
0:18:36,6 --> 0:18:37,7
Where were we?


563
0:18:37,7 --> 0:18:38,41
- Pick it up?


564
0:18:38,41 --> 0:18:39,81
I never stopped rolling.


565
0:18:39,81 --> 0:18:40,877
- What?


566
0:18:40,877 --> 0:18:48,623
- No, you got to...
You got to erase that.


567
0:18:48,623 --> 0:18:49,891
- What?


568
0:18:49,891 --> 0:18:52,394
- Yes, I'm telling you,
her fist is, like, this big.


569
0:18:52,394 --> 0:18:53,495
- I love her.


570
0:18:53,495 --> 0:18:55,13
- Huge.
- Oh.


571
0:18:55,13 --> 0:18:56,931
- Gigi.


572
0:18:56,931 --> 0:19:2,437
One set of Laila Ali
autographed boxing gloves.


573
0:19:2,437 --> 0:19:4,472
Thank you.


574
0:19:4,472 --> 0:19:6,441
Where's my picture?


575
0:19:6,441 --> 0:19:7,675
- Let me tell you something.


576
0:19:7,675 --> 0:19:10,211
Suzanne almost got knocked out,
I almost got shot.


577
0:19:10,211 --> 0:19:12,38
You better be glad you got those.


578
0:19:12,38 --> 0:19:13,948
- Thank you.
- Yeah.


579
0:19:13,948 --> 0:19:16,718
Got your gloves.
Now knock yourself out.


580
0:19:16,718 --> 0:19:17,685
- Bye.


581
0:19:17,685 --> 0:19:20,822
- Bye.
- B'bye.


582
0:19:20,822 --> 0:19:24,459
- Whoo, looks like we have
a nice trip to look forward to.


583
0:19:24,459 --> 0:19:26,194
- Oh, yes, honey.


584
0:19:26,194 --> 0:19:27,862
And lord knows I could use it.


585
0:19:27,862 --> 0:19:29,13
- Well, if you had paid attention


586
0:19:29,13 --> 0:19:30,832
and proofread that thing
like I told you,


587
0:19:30,832 --> 0:19:31,866
we wouldn't be in this.


588
0:19:31,866 --> 0:19:33,1
- Yeah, but you shouldn't...


589
0:19:33,1 --> 0:19:35,203
- Okay, what is going on here?


590
0:19:35,203 --> 0:19:36,938
- Lindsey got me in trouble at school.


591
0:19:36,938 --> 0:19:38,339
- How did Lindsey get you in trouble


592
0:19:38,339 --> 0:19:40,8
and you don't even go
to the same school?


593
0:19:40,8 --> 0:19:42,477
- Because mom asked her
to help me with my homework,


594
0:19:42,477 --> 0:19:43,945
and she wrote my paper.


595
0:19:43,945 --> 0:19:45,246
- You did what?


596
0:19:45,246 --> 0:19:46,448
- I was only trying to help him,


597
0:19:46,448 --> 0:19:47,615
but he kept playing video games


598
0:19:47,615 --> 0:19:49,17
and I had other things to do.


599
0:19:49,17 --> 0:19:51,82
- So that doesn't mean that you
do his assignment for him.


600
0:19:51,82 --> 0:19:53,421
But how did that get you in trouble?


601
0:19:53,421 --> 0:19:55,39
- When I was reading the paper
in front of the class.


602
0:19:55,39 --> 0:19:57,92
She put in the wrong information.


603
0:19:57,92 --> 0:20:3,31
- Well, what did it say?


604
0:20:3,31 --> 0:20:4,966
- Barack Kevin Obama.

He does not surf,

613
0:20:23,318 --> 0:20:25,987
Barack Obama rose to prominence
in the ghetto


614
0:20:25,987 --> 0:20:27,956
and then beat-boxed
and pop-locked his way


615
0:20:27,956 --> 0:20:28,957
into the senate,


616
0:20:28,957 --> 0:20:31,493

Any questions?

to you for a moment, please.


629
0:20:55,817 --> 0:20:57,651
- What?
