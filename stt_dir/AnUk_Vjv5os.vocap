###5 MALE SPEAKER: Do you have a new year's resolution?
###9 
###38 PATRICK O'DELL: Hi.
###38 Welcome back to the Epicly Later'd Show.
###42 This episode, we have Kevin "Spanky" Long.
###44 Kevin's skating is really spontaneous.
###46 I don't think he feels that kind of pressure that other
###48 skaters feel.
###49 He's going to just ride some spot and just try something
###52 until he lands it.
###53 He's doing a trick because, I think, he's having fun, and
###56 you can see that in the rest of his life, too, the way he
###58 lives and stuff.
###60 Everything's just right now, like everything's
###63 right in the present.
###65 So today, we're going to go into Spanky's apartment, and
###69 you can see for yourself how he lives.
###72 
###77 KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: Well, I was just gonna kind of like
###78 get a couch, maybe some pictures or something, maybe
###85 get a bed, like a proper bed.
###87 I don't know.
###88 The girls are working on it.
###90 PATRICK O'DELL: Where'd you get this giraffe?
###92 KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: I got that from the
###94 Fairfax swap meet.
###96 That's Reginald.
###97 PATRICK O'DELL: What?
###98 KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: His name.
###99 PATRICK O'DELL: Reginald?
###100 KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: Yeah.
###101 
###106 This is the original pizza of trust.
###108 PATRICK O'DELL: How long's that been there?
###110 KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: How long you think it's been here?
###112 Like month and a half?
###113 FEMALE SPEAKER: Month and a half.
###114 PATRICK O'DELL: Your dad tries to give you furniture?
###116 KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: Yeah.
###118 My dad's like constantly working on a million different
###122 projects at once.
###123 Like he gets these ideas, and then he's like, I want an old
###126 bus, and I'm going to make it all nice, and then we're going
###129 to go on family trips and stuff with the bus.
###133 But it's like all this kind of stuff, like that.
###136 It's my great-grandfather's chair.
###138 He was a barber.
###140 I guess he still has all the books and stuff that my
###143 great-grandpa had, like with the styles and cuts, and the
###147 scissors and everything.
###148 But he was afraid that I was going to spill wine all over
###154 everything.
###156 JON LONG: The revelation is, I mean, it's just
###158 in the blood, man.
###160 It's something to do with Irish.
###162 I mean, it's an innate fuckin' thing.
###166 He's ADD like his old man.
###168 It's just part of it.
###171 They used to put a block of wood under my chair because I
###174 was so tiny, and they thought that was
###176 going to calm me down.
###177 No way.
###178 I was frickin' off the wall.
###182 I was--
###183 whew.
###184 And so, I would take him to, like, Safeway, and skate with
###190 JT or his other buddies.
###192 He's going, dad, I got to land this trick, I got
###194 to land this trick.
###195 Like, that's fine, but mom's cooking dinner, so
###198 we got to get home.
###199 And he'd just go, I got to land this trick, and I'd call
###203 home and say, hey, we're going to be a little late.
###205 And he would sit there and sweat and work
###207 at doing this trick.
###209 And then he would make the trick, and then I'm like, OK,
###212 we're out of here, we're going, you did it, finally.
###215 And he says, I got to do it again.
###219 And that's Kevin.
###220 
###229 PATRICK O'DELL: You got to tell me what happened.
###232 KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: Well, I lost the keys, and my
###240 motorcycle's parked in front of it.
###244 And I had to get some shit out, so--
###247 PATRICK O'DELL: How'd you lose the key?
###249 KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: Well, the keys were like in my bag.
###252 I usually carry around a little bag like this.
###256 PATRICK O'DELL: That's like your purse?
###258 KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: Yeah, sort of.
###260 But I mean, it's just a black bag with my stuff.
###263 PATRICK O'DELL: I mean, what happened to the keys?
###266 That's a good plan, you know.
###268 KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: Yeah, it didn't fail until one of the
###272 bags blew out.
###273 It was like a thinner one like this, and with those you got
###276 to double bag sometimes.
###278 CHRIS SHONTING: Oh, the little man purse?
###280 The little deli bag, bodega.
###282 He usually carries it, but then I've seen him kind of
###285 like progress into strapping it around his neck.
###289 I guess it's literally like one of those situations if his
###292 head wasn't screwed on either, he'd lose that, but now he's
###295 got a bag around his neck.
###297 ATIBA JEFFERSON: If I could pick a lifestyle like that, I
###299 would go with his, because it's got be so stress-free.
###303 I mean, think about it, how many times he
###305 will flake on something.
###307 Spur of the moment, you could get the dude to go do
###309 something knowing he probably has prior engagements.
###313 But like, Spanky, let's go jam at the house, you know
###316 instantly, he's flaking on someone for dinner.
###319 And that's wha6t's funny.
###319 When you meet someone that's a little kid, you always picture
###322 them as a little kid.
###324 And I hate to say it, the dude's 22 and he's still a
###328 little kid.
###329 PATRICK O'DELL: How long have you known Spanky for?
###332 TERRY KENNEDY: Years.
###333 Like, I met him, Paul, Mikey, all like going to the valley,
###336 so five years.
###338 From knowing him when he was sponsored.
###339 It was like [INAUDIBLE]
###341 ATIBA JEFFERSON: I totally remember it.
###342 It was like, I remember the Gap.
###345 I was shooting photos.
###346 It was that Santa Monica Blue Gap, the Pawn Gap, and Mikey
###351 Taylor's trying a gnarly flip.
###353 But anyways, there was this kid, and he's sitting there,
###355 and he's frontside flipping it, like, good style and
###357 everything.
###358 And I was like, yeah, what's his name?
###360 And they're like, Spanky.
###361 KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: He is spaced.
###363 ANDREW REYNOLDS: It's different now.
###364 Like, now, he's kind of grown up.
###366 We became really good friends.
###367 But back then, it was, like, I'm this druggie guy, and
###371 you're like a little kid, so we really don't have much in
###374 common, you know what I mean?
###376 It was different back then.
###377 JAVIER NUNEZ: Spanky, though, it's funny how Spanky turned
###380 out, because I'm, like, how old?
###382 Like I said, I would be smoking, drinking, and he'd
###384 just be wildin' out, blazin' bitches, and fuckin', they
###387 would just look at me, like, oh damn.
###390 Because they wasn't really doing none of that shit.
###391 They was just young--
###392 PATRICK O'DELL: Spanky and Paul?
###392 JAVIER NUNEZ: --always talking about skating.
###394 Yeah, Spanky, Paul, Mikey, Devon, Cal, all them cats.
###397 KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: 6:23 in the morning, and we've been
###401 skating all night long.
###402 MALE SPEAKER: Hook him up!
###404 Give a little bit.
###404 Oh!
###407 Uh, uh, uh!
###410 MALE SPEAKER: Give him a hug, give him a tight squeeze.
###413 FEMALE SPEAKER: What's wrong, you scared?
###415 You a virgin?
###416 KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: I'm not scared.
###418 JAVIER NUNEZ: I've seen Spanky in the [INAUDIBLE]
###420 getting twisted.
###421 I'm like, ah, I got you a drink, what you want?
###423 Because it's funny, just like, people grow up, you know?
###426 ANDREW REYNOLDS: I guess City Star's kind of falling apart,
###429 and he had some offers to ride for Toy Machine or something
###432 like that, and I just kind of told him, like, you should
###436 just ride for us, you know?
###437 It's way better.
###439 And he knew what was right.
###441 PATRICK O'DELL: You had to convince him for a while,
###442 though, right?
###443 ANDREW REYNOLDS: Yeah.
###443 KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: I was going on that Baker tour to
###446 Australia, but I wasn't riding for Baker yet.
###448 I was trying to figure out if I was going ride for them or
###451 Toy Machine.
###452 Like, the whole time we were staying at Dustin's house, and
###457 that pretty much pressured me on the going on Baker, which
###461 I'm glad I did.
###462 But he was just torturing me the whole time, like, making
###466 me feel really bad for even questioning riding for Baker.
###469 What the fuck is wrong with you, man?
###472 Like, you know how Dustin is just like, you're stayin' in
###478 my house, like, what's the question here?
###483 Like, you ride for us.
###485 And basically, like, by the end of it, I heard, like, "you
###487 ride for us" so many times, it was like, all right, I can't
###491 say no to that.
###493 Especially to a young lad who's never been on a skate
###497 tour with people he's looked up to, and he's basically
###502 calling them a fucking asshole.
###504 ROBIN FLEMING: Yeah he went from being a baby to being a
###508 full-blown, jaded, fucking hipster.
###511 But he also doesn't take this whole thing that
###513 seriously, you know?
###514 He, I think, recognizes it, and is really grateful, which
###518 is refreshing.
###520 So it's a free life with a lot of wonderful travel and great
###523 opportunities to hang out with another amazing bros, and
###527 travel the world with your friends.
###529 He could lose everything and he wouldn't know.
###531 He doesn't care.
###532 And that's what's good about him.
###533 He cares about the right things.
###535
