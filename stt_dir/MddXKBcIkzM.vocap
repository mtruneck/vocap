###9 GELAREH KIAZAND: Dardar had been able to get us into a
###11 quail fight.
###11 But now we needed to find our way to the Ka Faroshi Bird
###14 Market, home to all of Kabul's rival bird trainers.
###18 Today was the first day of Eid [ARABIC], Eid al-Adha, the
###21 celebration of sacrifice.
###23 And Dardar invited us to join in on the festivities.

###32 
###49 GELAREH KIAZAND: So everyone basically comes together
###51 before Eid [ARABIC]
###53 And they all do the prayer before the sacrifice.
###57 So this is one of the main community mosques, where,
###61 apparently, thousands of people come.
###63 And they pray.
###64 It's pretty high security today.
###66 Everyone's worried about the bomb in the turban.

###110 GELAREH KIAZAND: They asked me to leave.
###111 They say it's not good for a woman to be inside the mosque.
###114 So I didn't want to cause any trouble.
###117 So I decided to leave.
###120 Now everyone's going to their homes to do the sacrifice.
###125 I think they're going to sacrifice that cow right now.
###129 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###131 
###145 GELAREH KIAZAND: That's disgusting.
###147 
###152 So what happens is that when a cow is sacrificed, or a sheep,
###156 they take a little bit for themselves.
###159 And then they basically cut up the meat.
###162 And they pass it to the poor or the rest of the community.
###165 So we're at someone's house.
###167 It smells so good here.
###168 It smells like mother's cooking.

###233 GELAREH KIAZAND: With festivities for Eid finished,
###235 animal fights were back on.
###237 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###249 GELAREH KIAZAND: We're on our way to a street called Ka
###251 Faroshi, which is where they sell the different types of
###255 birds that they bring out into the fights.
###257 For example, partridges, roosters, canaries, pigeons,
###261 and quails.
###262 
###273 The shopkeepers train and fight their animals as a team,
###275 because the buying and upkeep of birds is
###277 actually pretty expensive.
###279 If you walk around the market for long enough, you start to
###282 recognize some of the rival teams.
###284 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###311 GELAREH KIAZAND: He's got 48 kids and 12 grandchildren.
###314 And then they basically are working across the street,
###317 different shops, so he can pay off his debts.
###320 So these are where all his sons are.
###324 He owns all of these birds.
###326 And they're going to try to put together a fight for us.
###329 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###330 
###356 GELAREH KIAZAND: The next morning, after prayers, all
###358 the rival teams showed up for the match with their best
###360 fighting birds.
###363 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###364 
###370 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###386 GELAREH KIAZAND: The aim of partridge fights is for one
###387 bird to tie the other bird up.
###389 Apparently, they're really strong partridges.
###392 And they keep French kissing the birds to keep them cool.
###397 The owners hold water in their mouths and spit it onto their
###399 birds to make sure they don't overheat.

###438 GELAREH KIAZAND: One hour and 30 minutes.
###441 The bets have been raised.
###443 Apparently it's at 100,000 now.
###445 It started at 30,000.
###447 So see what animal is going to win, I guess.
###451 After two hours of fighting, one partridge finally stumbles
###454 out of the circle, ending the match.
###459 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###460 
###471 GELAREH KIAZAND: The bird was bought $2,000 a
###472 few months ago from--
###474 he bought it from the young guy.
###476 An then they bought it from the old man.
###479 And now it won the fight.
