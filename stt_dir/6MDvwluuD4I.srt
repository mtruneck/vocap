On this edition
of Mississippi Roads,


2
0:0:6,567 --> 0:0:8,867
we're walking into Clarksdale
with Robert Plant


3
0:0:8,867 --> 0:0:12,0
for the Sunflower River
Blues and Gospel Festival.


4
0:0:12,0 --> 0:0:15,133
Check in Clarksdale's
historic Riverside Hotel


5
0:0:15,133 --> 0:0:20,933
and take a musical journey
with Wilco's Pat Sansone.


6

I'm your host
Walt Grayson.


18
0:1:1,667 --> 0:1:4,33
This week we've traveled
up to Clarksdale


19
0:1:4,33 --> 0:1:16,433
for the 25th annual Sunflower
River Blues & Gospel Festival.


20
0:1:16,433 --> 0:1:21,767
♪♪


21
0:1:21,767 --> 0:1:25,433
It was always on the map, it's
just being on the map itself,


22
0:1:25,433 --> 0:1:32,167
Clarksdale did not realize
how much it was on the map.


23
0:1:32,167 --> 0:1:36,7
Bill and I sort of helped
along in that sense.


24
0:1:36,7 --> 0:1:38,467
People were coming
here from everywhere


25
0:1:38,467 --> 0:1:45,9
to hear blues and you
couldn't guarantee it.


26
0:1:45,9 --> 0:1:48,633
So we made it so you
could guarantee it.


27
0:1:48,633 --> 0:1:50,167
They are still
coming from everywhere,


28
0:1:50,167 --> 0:1:54,767
but now they stay.


29
0:1:54,767 --> 0:1:56,5
If you stick
around long enough,


30
0:1:56,5 --> 0:1:58,233
people hear about you.


31
0:1:58,233 --> 0:1:59,367
They will come.


32
0:1:59,367 --> 0:2:1,1
We say build
it, they'll come.


33
0:2:1,1 --> 0:2:2,633
Grayson:
And that's exactly
what people


34
0:2:2,633 --> 0:2:4,367
from all over the
world are doing:


35
0:2:4,367 --> 0:2:5,833
Traveling to
Clarksdale, Mississippi


36
0:2:5,833 --> 0:2:8,767
for the 25th annual
Sunflower Blues Festival.


37
0:2:8,767 --> 0:2:10,333
Freeman:
I'm feeling
pretty good


38
0:2:10,333 --> 0:2:13,333
about how it is now and
where it's basing itself


39
0:2:13,333 --> 0:2:15,833
after only been involved
with it for the last,


40
0:2:15,833 --> 0:2:19,1
what, 15 years?


41
0:2:19,1 --> 0:2:20,967
But look outside.


42
0:2:20,967 --> 0:2:35,7
We're smoking along.


43
0:2:35,7 --> 0:2:37,633
Grayson:
While Clarksdale
has always been


44
0:2:37,633 --> 0:2:39,333
a popular destination
for European travelers


45
0:2:39,333 --> 0:2:41,3
looking to trace
the Blues Trail,


46
0:2:41,3 --> 0:2:43,6
The Sunflower Blues
Festival offers three days


47
0:2:43,6 --> 0:2:45,467
of Blues and
Gospel music that


48
0:2:45,467 --> 0:2:48,333
generations of family
members can all enjoy.


49
0:2:48,333 --> 0:2:50,333
During the 2012
festival, Robert Plant,


50
0:2:50,333 --> 0:2:52,533
former front man for
Led Zeppelin showed up


51
0:2:52,533 --> 0:2:54,7
to give Clarksdale his
perspective on The Blues.


52
0:2:54,7 --> 0:2:56,7
Plant:
The only reason
to come to America


53
0:2:56,7 --> 0:2:58,5
is to come here,
really.


54
0:2:58,5 --> 0:3:3,733
Clarksdale is a
sort of condition


55
0:3:3,733 --> 0:3:6,2
I've had since I
was a kid.


56
0:3:6,2 --> 0:3:11,567
I was so moved by the
music when I had


57
0:3:11,567 --> 0:3:17,567
no knowledge of the social
structure of this state


58
0:3:17,567 --> 0:3:25,67
or even the kind of
racial interplay,


59
0:3:25,67 --> 0:3:26,933
if you want to
call it that.


60
0:3:26,933 --> 0:3:29,133
I had no idea
when I was a kid.


61
0:3:29,133 --> 0:3:31,133
I just heard the
music and I think


62
0:3:31,133 --> 0:3:34,4
like so many kids
around the world,


63
0:3:34,4 --> 0:3:35,867
no matter what
language you speak,


64
0:3:35,867 --> 0:3:43,467
it's very evocative and
infectious and alluring.


65
0:3:43,467 --> 0:3:45,967
But once you're drawn to
the sound of the music


66
0:3:45,967 --> 0:3:48,433
and the scales, then you
start learning more and more


67
0:3:48,433 --> 0:3:57,633
about the story
behind it all.


68
0:3:57,633 --> 0:4:0,4
I was 13 when
I first heard,


69
0:4:0,4 --> 0:4:3,867
I suppose, black
music generally.


70
0:4:3,867 --> 0:4:7,933
I guess it was
Sonny Boy Rice Miller


71
0:4:7,933 --> 0:4:9,9
and he was playing
and he became


72
0:4:9,9 --> 0:4:12,567
quite a celebrity in England
when I was in school.


73
0:4:12,567 --> 0:4:14,633
So I picked up
the harmonica.


74
0:4:14,633 --> 0:4:18,833
I loved the way that
he played and swung.


75
0:4:18,833 --> 0:4:22,1
He was a real
star in the UK.


76
0:4:22,1 --> 0:4:23,5
Grayson:
And with
the popularity


77
0:4:23,5 --> 0:4:24,967
of Mississippi Delta
Blues in Britain


78
0:4:24,967 --> 0:4:27,367
came the British Invasion
with all of their roots


79
0:4:27,367 --> 0:4:30,67
stemming from right
here in Mississippi.


80
0:4:30,67 --> 0:4:32,667
Freeman:
It's important because


81
0:4:32,667 --> 0:4:35,4
this is like
the Nativity.


82
0:4:35,4 --> 0:4:41,533
This is where American music
actually gets its base.


83
0:4:41,533 --> 0:4:45,267
All of American music,
somehow you can trace it


84
0:4:45,267 --> 0:4:50,1
all the way back down
here to Blues and Gospel


85
0:4:50,1 --> 0:4:59,5
right here in the Delta.


86
0:4:59,5 --> 0:5:2,167
Plant:
I see my own mortality
in a different light


87
0:5:2,167 --> 0:5:5,933
now to when I was a kid
and I know that when I


88
0:5:5,933 --> 0:5:10,7
was a kid, I did see a lot
of the people who are now


89
0:5:10,7 --> 0:5:17,133
heralded in this room who
were real space shifters.


90
0:5:17,133 --> 0:5:24,367
And I come back here
because I connect.


91
0:5:24,367 --> 0:5:27,0
There's a lot of unfinished
business down here.


92
0:5:27,0 --> 0:5:28,767
I don't know
what it is even,


93
0:5:28,767 --> 0:5:33,0
I just know that and
sometimes I feel


94
0:5:33,0 --> 0:5:38,767
very evocative moments
where I can feel history


95
0:5:38,767 --> 0:5:44,9
and I can feel...
I don't know.


96
0:5:44,9 --> 0:5:46,167
And on that note,


97
0:5:46,167 --> 0:5:48,833
I must wish you all
a very good night.


98
0:5:48,833 --> 0:6:0,833
(Applause) 


99
0:6:0,833 --> 0:6:2,933
Grayson:
Clarksdale is located
in Coahoma County


100
0:6:2,933 --> 0:6:4,633
in the heart of the
Mississippi Delta


101
0:6:4,633 --> 0:6:6,633
and home
to the Blues.


102
0:6:6,633 --> 0:6:8,667
We are at one of
Clarksdale's most famous


103
0:6:8,667 --> 0:6:10,7
or maybe should I say
one of Clarksdale's


104
0:6:10,7 --> 0:6:13,333
most infamous
blues landmarks:


105
0:6:13,333 --> 0:6:16,533
the intersection
of Highways 61 and 49.


106
0:6:16,533 --> 0:6:18,2
The notorious
crossroads where,


107
0:6:18,2 --> 0:6:20,233
local legend has it
that world-renown blues


108
0:6:20,233 --> 0:6:24,433
guitarist Robert Johnson
sold his soul to the devil.


109
0:6:24,433 --> 0:6:27,8
Or was that blues
guitarist Tommy Johnson?


110
0:6:27,8 --> 0:6:30,33
No, that was in Oh
Brother, Where Art Thou?


111
0:6:30,33 --> 0:6:32,33
Anyway, in our first
story we're going


112
0:6:32,33 --> 0:6:33,6
to visit a
Clarksdale landmark


113
0:6:33,6 --> 0:6:38,2
with a reputation a
little less sinister.


114
0:6:38,2 --> 0:6:40,67
1930's Radio Announcer:
We interrupt this broadcast


115
0:6:40,67 --> 0:6:41,567
to bring you this
breaking news:


116
0:6:41,567 --> 0:6:43,33
Jazz and Blues legend,
Bessie Smith,


117
0:6:43,33 --> 0:6:44,967
has been pronounced dead
in Clarksdale, Mississippi.


118
0:6:44,967 --> 0:6:46,733
Details are not
known at this time.


119
0:6:46,733 --> 0:6:48,233
Please stay tuned
for more information.


120
0:6:48,233 --> 0:6:50,567
Now, in memory,
Bessie Smith's,


121
0:6:50,567 --> 0:6:57,667
"'Taint Nobody's
Business If I Do."


122
0:6:57,667 --> 0:7:0,733
Bessie Smith was known-
or is known-


123
0:7:0,733 --> 0:7:3,733
as the empress
of the blues.


124
0:7:3,733 --> 0:7:8,733
She was making records and
people were buying them.


125
0:7:8,733 --> 0:7:13,0
In late September
1937, late at night


126
0:7:13,0 --> 0:7:15,833
coming from Memphis
to Clarksdale,


127
0:7:15,833 --> 0:7:19,9
Bessie and her driver
were coming down old 61.


128
0:7:19,9 --> 0:7:24,1
(tires squealing)


129
0:7:24,1 --> 0:7:27,533
She was brought by
ambulance to Clarksdale's


130
0:7:27,533 --> 0:7:39,333
G.T. Thomas Hospital, but
it was too late by then.


131
0:7:39,333 --> 0:7:41,67
Man:
It is the most
blues-historic place


132
0:7:41,67 --> 0:7:43,3
in the world
that you can stay.


133
0:7:43,3 --> 0:7:46,633
It's got the rich
history of pre-hotel,


134
0:7:46,633 --> 0:7:48,367
which when it was
the G.T. Thomas


135
0:7:48,367 --> 0:7:49,767
Afro-American
hospital,


136
0:7:49,767 --> 0:7:51,9
Bessie Smith, the
great blues singer


137
0:7:51,9 --> 0:7:54,5
from the 1920s died
there in 1937.


138
0:7:54,5 --> 0:7:57,367
Then in 1944 Frank
Ratliff's mother started


139
0:7:57,367 --> 0:7:59,6
the Riverside Hotel and
it has been continuously


140
0:7:59,6 --> 0:8:1,867
operating ever since then.


141
0:8:1,867 --> 0:8:6,833
This place was built
in 1920-something.


142
0:8:6,833 --> 0:8:9,6
These doors are
the originals.


143
0:8:9,6 --> 0:8:13,4
August 10th, 1944
that's when my mother


144
0:8:13,4 --> 0:8:15,267
brought me through
these doors


145
0:8:15,267 --> 0:8:18,267
when she opened
this business up.


146
0:8:18,267 --> 0:8:21,0
She's one of the
best-known ladies


147
0:8:21,0 --> 0:8:23,533
that's ever been
in these parts.


148
0:8:23,533 --> 0:8:26,533
She's seen the hardship and
her being a black woman,


149
0:8:26,533 --> 0:8:30,767
or a woman period, she
withstood the test of time


150
0:8:30,767 --> 0:8:34,567
because she kept business
going on even in the old days


151
0:8:34,567 --> 0:8:36,833
and stuff when things
were really tight.


152
0:8:36,833 --> 0:8:38,533
You have to consider
where we are


153
0:8:38,533 --> 0:8:40,533
and what that time
was like.


154
0:8:40,533 --> 0:8:43,1
Here's a lady that had
multiple businesses,


155
0:8:43,1 --> 0:8:44,3
had great store credit.


156
0:8:44,3 --> 0:8:46,233
She was a seamstress,
she had a café,


157
0:8:46,233 --> 0:8:47,867
she had a hotel.


158
0:8:47,867 --> 0:8:50,33
It was a lady who was
obviously very together


159
0:8:50,33 --> 0:8:54,167
and a very strong
and intelligent woman.


160
0:8:54,167 --> 0:8:58,4
When mother looked at this
place there were only 8 rooms.


161
0:8:58,4 --> 0:9:1,733
From this wall
to the back,


162
0:9:1,733 --> 0:9:7,533
that's what
mother had added.


163
0:9:7,533 --> 0:9:8,8
I don't buy furniture.


164
0:9:8,8 --> 0:9:12,67
I got furniture in here
over a hundred years old.


165
0:9:12,67 --> 0:9:21,6
That furniture
there: 1944.


166
0:9:21,6 --> 0:9:23,933
You look around at
all these pictures,


167
0:9:23,933 --> 0:9:27,8
these people have stayed
here, lived here.


168
0:9:27,8 --> 0:9:30,0
Some of them
lived here.


169
0:9:30,0 --> 0:9:32,633
Room nine:
Ike Turner.


170
0:9:32,633 --> 0:9:34,567
He lived here
for about four


171
0:9:34,567 --> 0:9:38,5
or five years
before he left.


172
0:9:38,5 --> 0:9:40,733
"Rocket 88,"
Ike Turner.


173
0:9:40,733 --> 0:9:43,133
It was written by
Jackie Brenston,


174
0:9:43,133 --> 0:9:45,67
the music and everything
was put together


175
0:9:45,67 --> 0:9:46,267
in the basement.


176
0:9:46,267 --> 0:9:52,367
They went to Memphis
and recorded it.


177
0:9:52,367 --> 0:9:55,8
Everybody that stayed
here called mom, "Mom."


178
0:9:55,8 --> 0:9:59,633
John Lee Hooker,
Sam Cooke,


179
0:9:59,633 --> 0:10:1,267
Muddy Waters
lived here.


180
0:10:1,267 --> 0:10:2,967
Stolle:
When he tells you
you're staying


181
0:10:2,967 --> 0:10:5,433
in the Muddy Waters room
or the Pop Staples room


182
0:10:5,433 --> 0:10:7,433
or the John Lee Hooker
room or whatever,


183
0:10:7,433 --> 0:10:8,9
they stayed there.


184
0:10:8,9 --> 0:10:11,367
So the music history is
just incredibly rich.


185
0:10:11,367 --> 0:10:13,133
You're staying right
where it happened,


186
0:10:13,133 --> 0:10:16,0
where the guys that
made the music stayed.


187
0:10:16,0 --> 0:10:18,967
They played with me
when I was small,


188
0:10:18,967 --> 0:10:21,9
when I was 4, 5,
and 6 years old.


189
0:10:21,9 --> 0:10:25,433
They lived here and after
they'd come from a gig,


190
0:10:25,433 --> 0:10:27,7
from playing, they'd
go back there


191
0:10:27,7 --> 0:10:29,867
and get me out
of my bed.


192
0:10:29,867 --> 0:10:32,933
You're staying here
because of its history


193
0:10:32,933 --> 0:10:35,867
in a lot of ways but
part of the history


194
0:10:35,867 --> 0:10:38,2
happens to be
the living guy


195
0:10:38,2 --> 0:10:41,33
that owns and
runs the place.


196
0:10:41,33 --> 0:10:43,633
My impression of
the place is


197
0:10:43,633 --> 0:10:45,167
it's a very
unassuming place.


198
0:10:45,167 --> 0:10:46,467
Appearances aren't
that important.


199
0:10:46,467 --> 0:10:48,267
It's one of the most
unpretentious places


200
0:10:48,267 --> 0:10:49,267
I've ever
been to.


201
0:10:49,267 --> 0:10:51,633
Came in and
fell in love with it


202
0:10:51,633 --> 0:10:53,2
immediately, learned
about all the people


203
0:10:53,2 --> 0:10:54,867
who had stayed here.


204
0:10:54,867 --> 0:10:56,9
I think we're in
Sam Cooke's room.


205
0:10:56,9 --> 0:10:59,9
It's all
really cool stuff.


206
0:10:59,9 --> 0:11:1,767
And then Rat, the
owner, is quality.


207
0:11:1,767 --> 0:11:3,9
He's a really good guy.


208
0:11:3,9 --> 0:11:6,633
Stolle:
Rat is actually
connected to the history.


209
0:11:6,633 --> 0:11:9,767
He's not a tour guide
that's sort of studied


210
0:11:9,767 --> 0:11:11,6
the patter and
gives it out.


211
0:11:11,6 --> 0:11:13,933
He's not an MA history
student just telling you


212
0:11:13,933 --> 0:11:15,567
what he'd learned.


213
0:11:15,567 --> 0:11:21,533
He's actually
lived the experience.


214
0:11:21,533 --> 0:11:23,467
Ritter:
Rat and the Riverside
are pillars


215
0:11:23,467 --> 0:11:28,833
of Clarksdale and the
historical community.


216
0:11:28,833 --> 0:11:30,567
Clarksdale isn't
like a museum piece,


217
0:11:30,567 --> 0:11:33,8
it's not this thing that's
just sunk in formaldehyde.


218
0:11:33,8 --> 0:11:36,67
It's still a living city.


219
0:11:36,67 --> 0:11:37,333
Everyone's very friendly.


220
0:11:37,333 --> 0:11:39,367
We've been hanging out
in bars and restaurants


221
0:11:39,367 --> 0:11:42,267
and everyone's
very hospitable.


222
0:11:42,267 --> 0:11:44,833
One of the really awesome
things for guests who stay


223
0:11:44,833 --> 0:11:47,267
at the Riverside Hotel,
is that not only are you


224
0:11:47,267 --> 0:11:48,467
welcomed when
you check in;


225
0:11:48,467 --> 0:11:50,9
you might get a tour if
you've never been there


226
0:11:50,9 --> 0:11:52,1
and some conversation
and history.


227
0:11:52,1 --> 0:11:54,267
But also he'll come
down and check on you.


228
0:11:54,267 --> 0:11:55,967
If you go to
Red's Lounge,


229
0:11:55,967 --> 0:11:57,467
he'll come and
check on you.


230
0:11:57,467 --> 0:11:59,267
Not because he thinks
something will happen


231
0:11:59,267 --> 0:12:2,67
but because he wants
you to feel at home.


232
0:12:2,67 --> 0:12:6,367
Try to get that out
of a five-star hotel.


233
0:12:6,367 --> 0:12:12,833
Riverside Hotel:
home away from home.


234
0:12:12,833 --> 0:12:14,9
See I'm just a caretaker.


235
0:12:14,9 --> 0:12:19,733
The people that come
here, they are the owners.


236
0:12:19,733 --> 0:12:22,67
And I tell them: if
you rent from me,


237
0:12:22,67 --> 0:12:32,6
then you just bought
stock in the Riverside.


238
0:12:32,6 --> 0:12:35,533
Not only is Mississippi the
birthplace of the Blues,


239
0:12:35,533 --> 0:12:37,8
but County Music, Rock
and Roll and a lot


240
0:12:37,8 --> 0:12:39,733
of other forms of
popular music can trace


241
0:12:39,733 --> 0:12:42,2
their roots back to
the Magnolia State.


242
0:12:42,2 --> 0:12:44,0
Maybe that's one of
the reasons why


243
0:12:44,0 --> 0:12:46,367
so many nationally
renowned artists


244
0:12:46,367 --> 0:13:7,5
have once called
Mississippi home.


245
0:13:7,5 --> 0:13:10,233
I'm sitting on the
third row I can't help


246
0:13:10,233 --> 0:13:15,67
but tell the person
next to me,


247
0:13:15,67 --> 0:13:17,333
"You see the
guy on the right?


248
0:13:17,333 --> 0:13:28,1
He's my boy!"


249
0:13:28,1 --> 0:13:30,4
That's when it
dawned on me


250
0:13:30,4 --> 0:13:32,967
that I think I'm the
father of a rock star.


251
0:13:32,967 --> 0:13:34,767
I'm not sure.


252
0:13:34,767 --> 0:13:36,8
It's like a storybook.


253
0:13:36,8 --> 0:13:38,8
Some people can't
believe your boy


254
0:13:38,8 --> 0:13:49,733
is playing with Wilco.


255
0:13:49,733 --> 0:13:53,567
Pat's just one of the
most natural musicians


256
0:13:53,567 --> 0:13:55,6
I've ever met.


257
0:13:55,6 --> 0:14:0,67
I've always been involved
with music from day one.


258
0:14:0,67 --> 0:14:2,5
My family
is very musical.


259
0:14:2,5 --> 0:14:4,933
Pat's grandmother was a
great musician, too.


260
0:14:4,933 --> 0:14:6,2
She played piano.


261
0:14:6,2 --> 0:14:7,967
And my grandmother
was a great musician.


262
0:14:7,967 --> 0:14:9,2
She played piano, too.


263
0:14:9,2 --> 0:14:10,2
They were sisters.


264
0:14:10,2 --> 0:14:12,733
So we kind of grew up in
that whole environment


265
0:14:12,733 --> 0:14:14,467
of living around
a house or going


266
0:14:14,467 --> 0:14:16,3
to a house on
Sundays or holidays


267
0:14:16,3 --> 0:14:18,467
where there was a lot
of music going on.


268
0:14:18,467 --> 0:14:20,8
That's the environment
that we grew up in.


269
0:14:20,8 --> 0:14:27,933
My dad grew up in a very
musically active family.


270
0:14:27,933 --> 0:14:32,2
They were always doing
shows around the house


271
0:14:32,2 --> 0:14:34,767
and for people in
the neighborhood.


272
0:14:34,767 --> 0:14:37,3
Show business was
kind of always part


273
0:14:37,3 --> 0:14:42,5
of their mode
of being.


274
0:14:42,5 --> 0:14:44,733
So he was getting music


275
0:14:44,733 --> 0:15:10,5
from both sides pretty
much all the time.


276
0:15:10,5 --> 0:15:15,0
The fact that my dad,
Tony Sansone,


277
0:15:15,0 --> 0:15:17,433
was involved with
a festival called


278
0:15:17,433 --> 0:15:19,333
the Lively Arts Festival.


279
0:15:19,333 --> 0:15:21,633
He booked acts
in Meridian


280
0:15:21,633 --> 0:15:22,867
at the Temple Theatre


281
0:15:22,867 --> 0:15:26,6
all through the 1970's
and 1980's.


282
0:15:26,6 --> 0:15:28,567
He was responsible
for bringing


283
0:15:28,567 --> 0:15:34,2
a lot of legendary
acts to Meridian.


284
0:15:34,2 --> 0:15:37,133
We had some
great shows here.


285
0:15:37,133 --> 0:15:40,167
My boy spent a lot
of time on the stage.


286
0:15:40,167 --> 0:15:42,467
That was his
growing up time.


287
0:15:42,467 --> 0:15:44,667
He would come down
here with me


288
0:15:44,667 --> 0:15:46,4
and do
sound checks.


289
0:15:46,4 --> 0:15:50,867
He got to see Ray Charles
and Tony Bennett.


290
0:15:50,867 --> 0:15:54,433
Gladys Knight and
the Commodores


291
0:15:54,433 --> 0:15:57,3
and lots of great
country acts.


292
0:15:57,3 --> 0:16:1,133
All these famous
people on the stage,


293
0:16:1,133 --> 0:16:4,2
he can kind of relate
to that even as a kid.


294
0:16:4,2 --> 0:16:22,133
Meridian is a
very musical city.


295
0:16:22,133 --> 0:16:24,267
He graduated down there
and he was staying


296
0:16:24,267 --> 0:16:29,1
down in Hattiesburg and
worked at a T-shirt place.


297
0:16:29,1 --> 0:16:31,133
When I left Hattiesburg
and moved


298
0:16:31,133 --> 0:16:34,333
to New Orleans in the
mid-1990's, John had moved


299
0:16:34,333 --> 0:16:38,0
from Oxford to New
Orleans as well.


300
0:16:38,0 --> 0:16:40,767
So both ended up in New
Orleans at the same time.


301
0:16:40,767 --> 0:16:43,467
We had really similar
tastes in terms of music


302
0:16:43,467 --> 0:16:49,6
that we bonded over
favorite records.


303
0:16:49,6 --> 0:16:52,5
So I started
bouncing songs off of him.


304
0:16:52,5 --> 0:16:55,967
We recorded the first
Autumn Defense record


305
0:16:55,967 --> 0:17:16,933
at King's Way in New Orleans,
a really great studio.


306
0:17:16,933 --> 0:17:20,733
Through that connection
and through our band,


307
0:17:20,733 --> 0:17:26,867
that's how I got to know Jeff
and Glenn and the Wilco guys.


308
0:17:26,867 --> 0:17:28,467
Everyone knew him
and that was


309
0:17:28,467 --> 0:17:30,33
sort of the way
with Wilco.


310
0:17:30,33 --> 0:17:33,967
It was always not
about auditions.


311
0:17:33,967 --> 0:17:37,0
It was more about
who was in the area


312
0:17:37,0 --> 0:17:40,2
and just friends.


313
0:17:40,2 --> 0:17:42,633
That's the way it has
always been with the band.


314
0:17:42,633 --> 0:17:46,167
Jeff knew that Nells Kline
would be a good fit


315
0:17:46,167 --> 0:17:48,733
and try to make a super
band or something


316
0:17:48,733 --> 0:17:53,633
to have Pat involved and
they both really raised


317
0:17:53,633 --> 0:18:5,267
the level of musicianship
in the band.


318
0:18:5,267 --> 0:18:10,9
He and Jeff have had this
wonderful sort of rapport


319
0:18:10,9 --> 0:18:14,767
where Jeff has
more of a vision,


320
0:18:14,767 --> 0:18:17,433
more of a big picture
guy and Pat is more


321
0:18:17,433 --> 0:18:20,933
of a small detail-oriented
guy in the studio.


322
0:18:20,933 --> 0:18:26,6
He has sort of been with Jeff
almost a musical director


323
0:18:26,6 --> 0:18:29,2
at different times
with the band.


324
0:18:29,2 --> 0:18:31,867
Pat:
It happened
very organically.


325
0:18:31,867 --> 0:18:37,133
It wasn't really set out that I
was going to be the coproducer


326
0:18:37,133 --> 0:18:40,0
of the record when we
started the record.


327
0:18:40,0 --> 0:18:42,667
We started making the
record in our own studio


328
0:18:42,667 --> 0:18:45,833
in Chicago without
an outside producer.


329
0:18:45,833 --> 0:18:51,833
There just came a point
in the process where there


330
0:18:51,833 --> 0:18:57,567
needed to be someone filling
the hole that was there


331
0:18:57,567 --> 0:19:0,67
because we didn't have
an outside producer.


332
0:19:0,67 --> 0:19:5,4
I think Jeff trusted me in that
situation enough to allow


333
0:19:5,4 --> 0:19:20,633
me to fill that role
with this record.


334
0:19:20,633 --> 0:19:22,167
They are
different animals,


335
0:19:22,167 --> 0:19:23,967
the studio and the stage.


336
0:19:23,967 --> 0:19:26,333
I love to perform.


337
0:19:26,333 --> 0:19:31,967
Just the feeling that you
get in that conversation


338
0:19:31,967 --> 0:19:33,567
between yourself
and the audience


339
0:19:33,567 --> 0:19:35,6
and the guys that you
are playing with.


340
0:19:35,6 --> 0:19:39,3
It can be a really
thrilling feeling


341
0:19:39,3 --> 0:19:41,867
when it's going well.


342
0:19:41,867 --> 0:19:50,767
There is no other place
that you can get that.


343
0:19:50,767 --> 0:19:54,167
We tried to do a show
that's satisfying


344
0:19:54,167 --> 0:19:57,167
to the crowd and
satisfying to us.


345
0:19:57,167 --> 0:19:58,533
There is a big catalog.


346
0:19:58,533 --> 0:20:1,633
The Wilco catalog is
pretty big at this point.


347
0:20:1,633 --> 0:20:12,767
There is a lot of
music to draw upon.


348
0:20:12,767 --> 0:20:16,133
I think of The Temple as sort
of a sacred place to me.


349
0:20:16,133 --> 0:20:18,333
That was the place
where my dad put on


350
0:20:18,333 --> 0:20:20,2
all of those shows
in the 1970's.


351
0:20:20,2 --> 0:20:22,4
We said, "Let's see
if we can get Wilco."


352
0:20:22,4 --> 0:20:24,167
So I called the office.


353
0:20:24,167 --> 0:20:28,2
I told him if you want to
book Wilco at The Temple


354
0:20:28,2 --> 0:20:33,2
like you always have,
good luck.


355
0:20:33,2 --> 0:20:36,567
He went through
the same process


356
0:20:36,567 --> 0:20:39,433
that anybody would
to book Wilco.


357
0:20:39,433 --> 0:20:41,5
He still makes fun
of me about that,


358
0:20:41,5 --> 0:20:43,33
but that's okay.


359
0:20:43,33 --> 0:20:44,967
We were only
going to do one show,


360
0:20:44,967 --> 0:20:46,433
so we didn't have
any computer


361
0:20:46,433 --> 0:20:48,1
or credit cards
set up.


362
0:20:48,1 --> 0:20:49,2
We didn't have
anything.


363
0:20:49,2 --> 0:20:51,4
I said you are going
to be getting people


364
0:20:51,4 --> 0:20:54,733
from all over the South,
maybe all over the country.


365
0:20:54,733 --> 0:20:57,167
There are going to
be people from all over


366
0:20:57,167 --> 0:20:59,4
that are going to be
coming to the show.


367
0:20:59,4 --> 0:21:2,433
Have you got
your credit card--


368
0:21:2,433 --> 0:21:5,33
do you have an online
thing happening


369
0:21:5,33 --> 0:21:6,9
for ticket buyers
or credit cards?


370
0:21:6,9 --> 0:21:8,567
He said oh no.


371
0:21:8,567 --> 0:21:10,967
We're probably not going
to do any credit cards.


372
0:21:10,967 --> 0:21:18,6
I said you have to have
a credit card set up.


373
0:21:18,6 --> 0:21:20,4
How are you going
to sell tickets


374
0:21:20,4 --> 0:21:21,9
to people all
over the country?


375
0:21:21,9 --> 0:21:24,9
He said we'll probably just
do like we always did.


376
0:21:24,9 --> 0:21:26,5
They can send me
a self-addressed


377
0:21:26,5 --> 0:21:31,33
stamped envelope and the
money for the tickets


378
0:21:31,33 --> 0:21:34,133
and we will send
their tickets back.


379
0:21:34,133 --> 0:21:36,333
I said that is
never going to work.


380
0:21:36,333 --> 0:21:38,2
You just can't do it.


381
0:21:38,2 --> 0:21:40,167
We couldn't send them
to the wrong place


382
0:21:40,167 --> 0:21:43,2
because they addressed
the envelope.


383
0:21:43,2 --> 0:21:47,567
We sold this theater out
in three or four days.


384
0:21:47,567 --> 0:21:51,2
Every single person
that sat in that theater,


385
0:21:51,2 --> 0:21:52,967
he had talked to
on the phone


386
0:21:52,967 --> 0:21:55,33
and helped them pick
out their seats.


387
0:21:55,33 --> 0:21:57,967
I think that's the way that
Tony had always produced


388
0:21:57,967 --> 0:22:1,3
and done shows and it
still worked for him


389
0:22:1,3 --> 0:22:2,833
with the Wilco show.


390
0:22:2,833 --> 0:22:4,567
And then the
next thing I know,


391
0:22:4,567 --> 0:22:24,5
we are booked at
The Temple Theater.


392
0:22:24,5 --> 0:22:28,733
It's a very rare and
unique opportunity


393
0:22:28,733 --> 0:22:32,767
to be able to play
with five other guys


394
0:22:32,767 --> 0:22:36,67
that get along so
well and also are


395
0:22:36,67 --> 0:22:40,333
able to connect so
deeply musically.


396
0:22:40,333 --> 0:22:43,633
I feel very lucky to
be able to do this


397
0:22:43,633 --> 0:22:45,633
with these guys.


398
0:22:45,633 --> 0:22:48,67
I think he is a goodwill
ambassador for our state.


399
0:22:48,67 --> 0:22:49,767
We've had a lot of
other musicians


400
0:22:49,767 --> 0:22:51,7
that were goodwill
ambassadors, too.


401
0:22:51,7 --> 0:22:53,667
Chris Etheridge
who just left us


402
0:22:53,667 --> 0:22:55,867
was a goodwill ambassador
for our state.


403
0:22:55,867 --> 0:22:59,3
I think Pat is kind of
filling those shoes now.


404
0:22:59,3 --> 0:23:3,867
I'm about as proud as a
dad can be of a son who's


405
0:23:3,867 --> 0:23:7,667
done real well and
he's a nice person.


406
0:23:7,667 --> 0:23:12,4
Patrick is a nice person


407
0:23:12,4 --> 0:23:24,6
who happens to be
a great musician.


408
0:23:24,6 --> 0:23:33,67
(Applause)


409
0:23:33,67 --> 0:23:35,6
Regrettably, that's all the
time we have for this episode.


410
0:23:35,6 --> 0:23:37,6
But if you'd like any
information about anything


411
0:23:37,6 --> 0:23:38,967
you've seen on
tonight's show,


412
0:23:38,967 --> 0:23:43,267
contact us at:


413
0:23:43,267 --> 0:23:44,833
Until next time,
I'm Walt Grayson.


414
0:23:44,833 --> 0:23:51,9
I'll be seeing you
on Mississippi Roads.


415
0:23:51,9 --> 0:23:54,567
We close tonight with a song
written by Graham Parsons


416
0:23:54,567 --> 0:23:56,1
and Meridian's own
Chris Etheridge.


417
0:23:56,1 --> 0:23:58,7
We lost the legendary Chris
Etheridge a few months ago.


418
0:23:58,7 --> 0:24:9,2
