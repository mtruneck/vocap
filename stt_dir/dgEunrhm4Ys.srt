PAUL JAY: Welcome to The Real News Network.
I'm Paul Jay in Baltimore. And we're continuing


2
0:0:12,92 --> 0:0:17,39
our discussions with members of LEAP, Law
Enforcement Against Prohibition. These are


3
0:0:17,39 --> 0:0:24,54
police officers who believe that the prohibition
against drugs is failing and the war on drugs


4
0:0:24,54 --> 0:0:27,66
should be stopped and drugs should be legalized.


5
0:0:27,66 --> 0:0:32,599
Now joining us to talk about this, first of
all, is Stephen Downing. Stephen's a retired


6
0:0:32,599 --> 0:0:36,72
deputy chief of police for the Los Angeles
Police Department. He was commander of the


7
0:0:36,72 --> 0:0:43,21
Bureau of Special Investigations. One of those
divisions was the Administrative Narcotics


8
0:0:43,21 --> 0:0:46,26
Division. Thanks for joining us.


9
0:0:46,26 --> 0:0:50,329
Also joining us is Terry Nelson. Terry's law
enforcement career spanned three decades.


10
0:0:50,329 --> 0:0:55,59
It included service in the U.S. Border Patrol,
U.S. Customs Service, and the Department of


11
0:0:55,59 --> 0:1:0,239
Homeland Security, taking him beyond the U.S.
borders into Mexico, Central America, and


12
0:1:0,239 --> 0:1:5,27
South America. In various capacities he acquired
a first-hand knowledge of the war on drugs


13
0:1:5,27 --> 0:1:9,85
through his direct involvement with counternarcotics
missions. Thanks very much for joining us.


14
0:1:9,85 --> 0:1:10,74
TERRY NELSON: Thank you for having me.


15
0:1:10,74 --> 0:1:19,17
JAY: So start with your own story. You're
a Texan. You told me off-camera you're a Republican.


16
0:1:19,17 --> 0:1:23,899
You grew up with these values (I would have
thought) that the war on drugs is a necessity,


17
0:1:23,899 --> 0:1:28,289
and you were involved in fighting it. What
is your thinking in the beginning of your


18
0:1:28,289 --> 0:1:31,14
career? And how does that--your experience
change that thinking?


19
0:1:31,14 --> 0:1:34,59
NELSON: Well, as a young officer, you think
you can make a difference, of course, and


20
0:1:34,59 --> 0:1:38,88
you spend years trying, and then all of a
sudden you realize the futility of what you're


21
0:1:38,88 --> 0:1:40,819
doing 'cause you're not making any progress.


22
0:1:40,819 --> 0:1:46,49
I never really turned against the war on drugs
until I got into command structure and was


23
0:1:46,49 --> 0:1:51,36
working in Central and South America and saw
the total futility of--like, Plan Colombia


24
0:1:51,36 --> 0:1:56,81
was $5.2 billion we spent trying to train
the Colombian police and spraying herbicides


25
0:1:56,81 --> 0:2:2,9
on the coca crop. At the end of five years
of that program, the coca production went


26
0:2:2,9 --> 0:2:7,33
up 25 percent in Colombia. So either we were
spraying fertilizer on it instead of herbicide


27
0:2:7,33 --> 0:2:13,2
or the farmers became much better. And that's
what happened. The more successful we were


28
0:2:13,2 --> 0:2:16,38
in destroying the crops, the more successful
the farmers were, and they tripled the yield


29
0:2:16,38 --> 0:2:20,99
of the coca plant in about three years. So
they made up all the difference and actually


30
0:2:20,99 --> 0:2:24,909
produced 25 percent more cocaine than they
had at the beginning of the drug war. You


31
0:2:24,909 --> 0:2:28,86
see this and you know you're not going to
arrest your way out of the drug war. Arrest


32
0:2:28,86 --> 0:2:32,26
and incarceration will never work. But education,
we believe, will work.


33
0:2:32,26 --> 0:2:37,19
JAY: Okay. So that coin dropped for you, but
you're working with other officers. And in


34
0:2:37,19 --> 0:2:41,659
the command structure, do you talk about these
things? And what kind of pushback do you get?


35
0:2:41,659 --> 0:2:49,17
NELSON: Well, you talk about it somewhat,
but you have to be careful, because everyone


36
0:2:49,17 --> 0:2:52,219
wants to get promoted. That's the whole purpose
of going in, to work your way up the chain,


37
0:2:52,219 --> 0:2:55,159
where you can have more influence on what's
going on.


38
0:2:55,159 --> 0:3:0,109
I spoke out at an interdiction committee meeting
one time with--I called in a triple-PhD from


39
0:3:0,109 --> 0:3:4,859
Washington, D.C., that came down just to tell
us how to do the--he was laying out economic


40
0:3:4,859 --> 0:3:8,709
models and said, if we can just destroy this
much property, this much coke, we can win


41
0:3:8,709 --> 0:3:13,45
this drug war. And I stood up and said, am
I the only SOB in this room that thinks we're


42
0:3:13,45 --> 0:3:18,79
doing this wrong and we should change our
strategy? And everybody applauded until I


43
0:3:18,79 --> 0:3:21,28
was called up in front of the room and he
stuck his finger in my chest and said, Agent


44
0:3:21,28 --> 0:3:25,62
Nelson, you don't make policy, you carry it
out, so you salute smartly and you go back


45
0:3:25,62 --> 0:3:30,379
and sit down [incompr.] Okay. So when I got
out of the service, I decided I was going


46
0:3:30,379 --> 0:3:32,359
to help change that policy, because I could
do it then.


47
0:3:32,359 --> 0:3:39,909
JAY: Stephen, how about you? You're in tough
territory, downtown L.A. Drugs must be one


48
0:3:39,909 --> 0:3:45,9
of the overwhelming things you have to deal
with. You must have bought into this idea


49
0:3:45,9 --> 0:3:46,3
that it was necessary.


50
0:3:46,3 --> 0:3:54,99
STEPHEN DOWNING: Well, as a young 22-year-old
coming in from a rural community, going into


51
0:3:54,99 --> 0:4:1,459
the academy, you listen to what they tell
you and you believe it. And so you buy into--at


52
0:4:1,459 --> 0:4:7,749
that time you were still buying into the residual
of Harry Anslinger, who said that blacks and


53
0:4:7,749 --> 0:4:13,599
browns use marijuana and it makes them rape
white women. And so a lot of the myth-making


54
0:4:13,599 --> 0:4:18,57
was still alive. And you believe it. You go
out on the street.


55
0:4:18,57 --> 0:4:24,73
And in those days, just possession of a tiny
amount of marijuana was a felony. Well, a


56
0:4:24,73 --> 0:4:31,94
felony arrest was a big deal for a young police
officer. And so you did your job. And in those


57
0:4:31,94 --> 0:4:38,37
days, especially in those days, quota systems
were rampant. The measurement of good police


58
0:4:38,37 --> 0:4:45,22
work was not an absence of crime; it was what
did your recap look like at the end of the


59
0:4:45,22 --> 0:4:54,28
day. But as you grow and you go through the
ranks and you study and you become a manager,


60
0:4:54,28 --> 0:5:2,43
you realize that there are more effective
methods for supervising police operations.


61
0:5:2,43 --> 0:5:8,979
And so by the time I was a commander, it was
about the same time that President Nixon announced


62
0:5:8,979 --> 0:5:14,65
the war on drugs, and it was also the same
time that I had just uncovered at the divisional


63
0:5:14,65 --> 0:5:20,449
level the growth of two small gangs. They
were called the Bloods and the Crips. And


64
0:5:20,449 --> 0:5:27,729
they had a membership of less than 100. So
our charge--when Nixon announced the war on


65
0:5:27,729 --> 0:5:35,129
drugs, I took over the narcotic effort, narcotic
enforcement effort. Our strategy, which was


66
0:5:35,129 --> 0:5:41,27
the national strategy--cut the head off the
snake, reduce the flow of drugs into the country,


67
0:5:41,27 --> 0:5:47,599
and reduce drug abuse and drug addiction.
Well, as we started, a big deal when we call


68
0:5:47,599 --> 0:5:54,94
the press for our dog-and-pony shows: one
or two kilos, a few thousand dollars, a few


69
0:5:54,94 --> 0:6:1,15
handguns. Next month, it's a little more than
that. A little more. A little more.


70
0:6:1,15 --> 0:6:11,479
So today you look at it--and there is really
no metric--none--that measures success--all


71
0:6:11,479 --> 0:6:18,65
of the metrics say this is a failure. Those
two small gangs in the 40 years of this drug


72
0:6:18,65 --> 0:6:27,319
war have grown to 33,000 gangs across the
nation with a membership of 1.5 million. When


73
0:6:27,319 --> 0:6:32,139
we started, the cartels were barely heard
of. They were somewhere in South America,


74
0:6:32,139 --> 0:6:39,569
Latin America. Two years ago, the DOJ said
the cartels control drug trafficking with


75
0:6:39,569 --> 0:6:48,729
the help of the gangs in 250 American cities.
This year the DOJ said the drug cartels control


76
0:6:48,729 --> 0:6:52,46
drug trafficking in 1,000 American cities.


77
0:6:52,46 --> 0:7:0,96
So we haven't made a dent in these three strategy
approaches. Addiction, drug abuse, it goes


78
0:7:0,96 --> 0:7:14,27
up and down. The flow of drugs is now warehouses
full. The guns are tens of thousands of war-level


79
0:7:14,27 --> 0:7:20,909
weapons. And the money, even being laundered
by domestic banks, they get a slap on the


80
0:7:20,909 --> 0:7:24,939
hand, there's millions of dollars on pallets.


81
0:7:24,939 --> 0:7:31,24
And cutting the head off the snake, I came
to discover as a police executive who likes


82
0:7:31,24 --> 0:7:39,509
to do a good job and likes to meet his goals
and effectively execute the strategy, that


83
0:7:39,509 --> 0:7:46,74
was a big thing to me, because I finally decided
there's no snake, it's starfish. And when


84
0:7:46,74 --> 0:7:52,699
you cut a starfish in half, you get two starfish.
When you cut it four ways, you get four. And


85
0:7:52,699 --> 0:7:58,46
the only way to kill a starfish is to remove
its nutrient. And in the case of the cartels


86
0:7:58,46 --> 0:8:1,319
and the gangs, the nutrient is money.


87
0:8:1,319 --> 0:8:6,699
They can't function without money. They can't
buy guns, money can't be laundered, and they'll


88
0:8:6,699 --> 0:8:13,65
be out of business. And so prohibition creates
their opportunity for money. And if we take


89
0:8:13,65 --> 0:8:19,53
that black market away, we're going to dry
'em up. And that's what I discovered as a


90
0:8:19,53 --> 0:8:27,319
police executive. And that's why I believe
that the only way to get out from under this--.


91
0:8:27,319 --> 0:8:35,26
And since I've left the department in the
'80s, they just poured more money in, unprecedented


92
0:8:35,26 --> 0:8:41,51
money. They militarized our police. The federal
government bought off our police, in effect,


93
0:8:41,51 --> 0:8:45,2
by providing military equipment, by providing
grants.


94
0:8:45,2 --> 0:8:52,92
This asset-seizure program, it's evil. It's
totally evil. They say they created it to


95
0:8:52,92 --> 0:9:0,2
get the kingpins, but the average seizure's
$15,000, and if a guy wants to get his $15,000


96
0:9:0,2 --> 0:9:5,4
car back, he can't hire a lawyer for that
kind of money. So all of these things that


97
0:9:5,4 --> 0:9:13,58
go into the harm of people, the discussions
about prisons--California in 1980 had a total


98
0:9:13,58 --> 0:9:21,62
prison population of 23,000. Between 1980
and now, we've built 23 prisons, we've hired


99
0:9:21,62 --> 0:9:27,62
thousands of prison guards, we've fired thousands
of teachers. Today our prison population is


100
0:9:27,62 --> 0:9:36,5
163,000. Twenty-five thousand of those are
nonviolent drug offenders, at $65,000 a piece


101
0:9:36,5 --> 0:9:41,66
a year to keep them in jail. That's $1.52
million.


102
0:9:41,66 --> 0:9:48,44
And this year, we told our 23-campus university
system: no more new students. Our community


103
0:9:48,44 --> 0:9:57,3
college student--three weeks ago, demonstrations,
500,000 kids can't get classes. So we're trading


104
0:9:57,3 --> 0:10:3,23
the education of America for a drug war that's
just stacking our prisons with cordwood, destroying


105
0:10:3,23 --> 0:10:8,2
families, destroying neighborhoods, unraveling
our whole social structure.


106
0:10:8,2 --> 0:10:14,75
JAY: So when colleagues of yours, people you
know in law enforcement hear arguments like


107
0:10:14,75 --> 0:10:19,66
this and arguments that you give, I don't
understand how they cannot be persuaded. What


108
0:10:19,66 --> 0:10:26,82
is this sort of moral imperative that seems
to be deep in American political culture that


109
0:10:26,82 --> 0:10:30,85
you got to fight this war on drugs 'cause
somehow it represents the struggle between


110
0:10:30,85 --> 0:10:32,23
good and evil or something?


111
0:10:32,23 --> 0:10:38,36
NELSON: Well, our drug czar recently came
out and said that drug abuse is not a moral


112
0:10:38,36 --> 0:10:41,83
failure. So he actually came out and said
that. And he also said, we're not going to


113
0:10:41,83 --> 0:10:44,32
arrest our way out of the drug war. The issue
is--.


114
0:10:44,32 --> 0:10:45,36
JAY: Who said that?


115
0:10:45,36 --> 0:10:47,63
NELSON: Kerlikowski, the drug czar.


116
0:10:47,63 --> 0:10:54,35
The issue is it's institutionalized. Prison
unions fight us all the time. Police unions


117
0:10:54,35 --> 0:11:1,29
fight us because they don't want it legalized,
because then they're going to lose membership.


118
0:11:1,29 --> 0:11:4,93
As he mentioned earlier, the police make a
tremendous amount of money from the federal


119
0:11:4,93 --> 0:11:10,87
government, not counting--if the police arrest
someone at night, a couple of kids for a few


120
0:11:10,87 --> 0:11:14,84
joints, they take them in and arrest them,
put them in jail, they go back the next day


121
0:11:14,84 --> 0:11:19,0
for a hearing, they get three hours overtime
a piece. It's a money-making machine for them.


122
0:11:19,0 --> 0:11:20,65
They don't want to quit it.


123
0:11:20,65 --> 0:11:25,2
The military-industrial complex does not want
it to end, because if you sell a Sikorsky


124
0:11:25,2 --> 0:11:29,62
helicopter to Colombia for $16 million, that's
nothing. It's going to cost $100 million a


125
0:11:29,62 --> 0:11:32,8
year to put the maintenance contract in place
to keep them flying.


126
0:11:32,8 --> 0:11:36,74
So it's all about the money. In law enforcement,
it's all about the Benjamins. You follow the


127
0:11:36,74 --> 0:11:42,21
money trail, you find the problem. And everybody's
making money off of the current drug war at


128
0:11:42,21 --> 0:11:49,57
the expense of our children's futures, because
when you get arrested for a drug offense,


129
0:11:49,57 --> 0:11:52,74
I don't care if they don't put you in jail;
you've got an arrest record. And when you


130
0:11:52,74 --> 0:11:56,51
go to get a job, you check the box, they see
you've had an arrest, they look and you had


131
0:11:56,51 --> 0:12:0,77
a drug arrest, you're not going to get hired.
You're going to be marginalized the rest of


132
0:12:0,77 --> 0:12:3,87
your life. And that's going to mean you're
not going to pay your fair share of the taxes


133
0:12:3,87 --> 0:12:9,17
that you would have earned if you'd have been
able to get a decent job. And instead of being--contributing


134
0:12:9,17 --> 0:12:14,13
to your society, you actually are a drain
on our society.


135
0:12:14,13 --> 0:12:17,98
And I don't blame the people, other than the
fact that they broke the law. They're in a


136
0:12:17,98 --> 0:12:22,25
position they can't get out of. I mean, once
you've got the arrest record, that monkey's


137
0:12:22,25 --> 0:12:26,29
on your back the rest of your life. Our saying
in LEAP is you can get over an addiction;


138
0:12:26,29 --> 0:12:30,6
you will never get over a conviction, 'cause
it follows you throughout your life.


139
0:12:30,6 --> 0:12:37,19
So it's not just a short-term thing. It ruins
the people for the next 30, 40 years, breaks


140
0:12:37,19 --> 0:12:41,63
up families. One-point-nine million kids go
to bed every night 'cause one of their parents


141
0:12:41,63 --> 0:12:45,48
are in prison. Forty-some-odd percent of the
people that go to prison this year will have


142
0:12:45,48 --> 0:12:50,91
had a family member in prison in front of
them. And 25 percent of the children or the


143
0:12:50,91 --> 0:12:54,85
kids that will go to prison this year come
out of a foster home or an institution.


144
0:12:54,85 --> 0:12:59,18
Well, that tells you right there this is a
hamster wheel. We're destroying the very people


145
0:12:59,18 --> 0:13:3,51
that drug policy claims to want to protect,
which is our children. We're breaking up families.


146
0:13:3,51 --> 0:13:8,14
They're raised in foster home. They've become--one
parent goes to jail, the other parent has


147
0:13:8,14 --> 0:13:12,17
to get a second job. There's no one to monitor
the kids. The evil wheel keeps turning. They're


148
0:13:12,17 --> 0:13:15,91
on the street. They're going to get in trouble.
We all know that. Kids are going to be kids.


149
0:13:15,91 --> 0:13:18,7
We've got to keep our kids safe until they
reach adulthood.


150
0:13:18,7 --> 0:13:26,42
JAY: So some people think that if you legalize,
it leads virtually to anarchy. If it's legal,


151
0:13:26,42 --> 0:13:29,25
everyone's going to go out and do drugs or
way more people are going to run off and do


152
0:13:29,25 --> 0:13:33,47
drugs, and the place is going to go crazy,
and we've got to clamp down on it. I mean,


153
0:13:33,47 --> 0:13:34,67
how do you argue against that?


154
0:13:34,67 --> 0:13:42,28
DOWNING: We legalized alcohol after a horrible
13-year experience where we discovered we


155
0:13:42,28 --> 0:13:49,94
really made some very bad decisions, and that
didn't happen. We retune it and we returned


156
0:13:49,94 --> 0:13:56,75
at that time. We passed a constitutional amendment
to put it into effect, and we passed a constitutional


157
0:13:56,75 --> 0:14:4,15
amendment to get rid of alcohol prohibition,
and we returned the responsibility to the


158
0:14:4,15 --> 0:14:9,71
states, which is provided by our constitution,
demanded by our constitution. And all of the


159
0:14:9,71 --> 0:14:16,35
states, gee, they worked things out, they
controlled and regulated and set up their


160
0:14:16,35 --> 0:14:21,25
systems, and they served as models for each
other, and they would adopt things. So over


161
0:14:21,25 --> 0:14:25,78
time we had regulated and controlled alcohol.


162
0:14:25,78 --> 0:14:32,22
And during the same time, the organized crime
syndicates that were born as a result of alcohol


163
0:14:32,22 --> 0:14:39,51
prohibition, they died. We took their nutrients
away, like I say, and they died out. Now,


164
0:14:39,51 --> 0:14:46,18
we're always going to have some criminal organizations,
but when we announce a war on drugs, zoom--right


165
0:14:46,18 --> 0:14:53,62
back they came. But this time, the bribery
is institutionalized. In Capone's day, they


166
0:14:53,62 --> 0:14:59,5
took the brown bag full of money and handed
it to the politicians or the policemen. These


167
0:14:59,5 --> 0:15:9,25
days, the money comes through our system and
bribes our institutions and our police, especially


168
0:15:9,25 --> 0:15:16,75
because they've militarized our police and
they've diverted them away from what I call


169
0:15:16,75 --> 0:15:22,13
the social contract our police officers have
with their communities, and that's to protect


170
0:15:22,13 --> 0:15:27,26
them from crimes against person and crimes
against property.


171
0:15:27,26 --> 0:15:33,24
A perfect example in Los Angeles two years
ago--you might have read about it. The paper


172
0:15:33,24 --> 0:15:41,91
uncovered the fact that the police laboratory
was backlogged 3,000 rape kids, a three-year


173
0:15:41,91 --> 0:15:48,85
backlog, meaning that women who have been
raped were waiting for their cases to be resolved


174
0:15:48,85 --> 0:15:54,7
because detectives handling their cases did
not have laboratory results. So it was a big


175
0:15:54,7 --> 0:15:59,42
[haz@rA], and they scrambled around and they
found $10 million and said, we're going to


176
0:15:59,42 --> 0:16:0,65
catch this up.


177
0:16:0,65 --> 0:16:6,66
Well, what nobody really said is: how come
they're backlogged? And the reason they're


178
0:16:6,66 --> 0:16:14,1
backlogged is because when a person is arrested
with narcotics, that's a body in custody that's


179
0:16:14,1 --> 0:16:20,22
going to show up in court, and they can't
show up in court until that narcotic has been


180
0:16:20,22 --> 0:16:31,42
analyzed. And so all this dope arrests, 43
million arrests since 1971 in this country,


181
0:16:31,42 --> 0:16:36,69
those are analyzed in our laboratories. And
every time somebody's arrested, the others


182
0:16:36,69 --> 0:16:38,17
are pushed back.


183
0:16:38,17 --> 0:16:43,53
So they cleaned that one up. And this year,
now they've got--they're behind by 4,000 fingerprint


184
0:16:43,53 --> 0:16:48,85
examinations. Fingerprint examinations are
coming off of burglaries, they're coming off


185
0:16:48,85 --> 0:16:57,4
of assaults, they're coming off of robberies,
stores. These are the crimes the police are


186
0:16:57,4 --> 0:17:1,89
supposed to be working with their communities
to solve. But at the same time they're making


187
0:17:1,89 --> 0:17:7,13
all these narcotic arrests, they're angering
people in the communities because they're


188
0:17:7,13 --> 0:17:11,929
jacking the kids up against the walls or sitting
them on the sidewalks, they're draping them


189
0:17:11,929 --> 0:17:21,279
across the hoods of their cars. And 90 percent
of those frisks that are going on are all


190
0:17:21,279 --> 0:17:28,299
about drugs. They're not about the criminal
problems. And so pretty soon you don't have


191
0:17:28,299 --> 0:17:34,879
a community communicating with you, you don't
have a community cooperating with you, because


192
0:17:34,879 --> 0:17:40,929
this drug war has destroyed that cooperation
and it's destroyed respect for the professional


193
0:17:40,929 --> 0:17:42,1
law enforcement.


194
0:17:42,1 --> 0:17:44,44
JAY: Just quickly, what would you like to
see?


195
0:17:44,44 --> 0:17:49,23
NELSON: I would like to see total legalization
of all drugs, which will cure about 80 percent


196
0:17:49,23 --> 0:17:53,44
of our crime and violence issues. Won't do
anything for our drug problem, because that's


197
0:17:53,44 --> 0:17:57,629
a separate issue, and I believe that's a medical
and a social issue that's best handled through


198
0:17:57,629 --> 0:18:0,659
education and treatment instead of arrest
and incarceration.


199
0:18:0,659 --> 0:18:1,629
JAY: Thanks very much.


200
0:18:1,629 --> 0:18:2,669
NELSON: Thank you for having us.


201
0:18:2,669 --> 0:18:3,269
JAY: Thank you very much.


202
0:18:3,269 --> 0:20:3,269
And thank you for joining us on The Real News
Network.
