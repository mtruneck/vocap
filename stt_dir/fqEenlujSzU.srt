2
0:0:27,88 --> 0:0:30,8
(Grinding, whirring, banging)


3
0:0:30,8 --> 0:0:32,32
What are they building? The noise!


4
0:0:32,32 --> 0:0:35,16
They'll finish soon,
we'll have a quiet Sunday.


5
0:0:35,16 --> 0:0:37,16
(Loud grinding)


6
0:0:37,16 --> 0:0:41,16
- Jesus.
- We'll just have to blank it out.


7
0:0:41,16 --> 0:0:45,6
Hi. Hi. Erm, I was wondering
if you could do a book search for me?


8
0:0:45,6 --> 0:0:48,36
I'm looking for a biography of Schubert.


9
0:0:48,36 --> 0:0:54,4
So if you could hunt it up for me,
I'll wait here.


10
0:0:54,4 --> 0:0:58,92
What kind of coffee do you do?


11
0:0:58,92 --> 0:1:1,36
This is a book shop, we don't do coffee.


12
0:1:1,36 --> 0:1:3,68
- The other book shops do.
- Listen, you...


13
0:1:3,68 --> 0:1:12,64
(Drowned out by grinding)


14
0:1:12,64 --> 0:1:16,12
This Schubert, this book search,
how does it work?


15
0:1:16,12 --> 0:1:21,76
Well, you know.
You just... and it pops up.


16
0:1:21,76 --> 0:1:25,4
We've a different sort of...


17
0:1:25,4 --> 0:1:27,8
here.


18
0:1:27,8 --> 0:1:29,52
Get on your knees.


19
0:1:29,52 --> 0:1:31,56
Put your hands on the floor.


20
0:1:31,56 --> 0:1:36,2
From where you are now
to that far corner is our music section.


21
0:1:36,2 --> 0:1:40,44
It's a bit mixed up with aviation,
botany and pregnancy.


22
0:1:40,44 --> 0:1:46,2
- Search!
- (Thunderous grinding)


23
0:1:46,2 --> 0:1:50,16
That is the kind of thing
that is going to put customers off.


24
0:1:50,16 --> 0:1:58,0
- (Grinding resumes)
- Go and see when the noise will stop!


25
0:1:58,0 --> 0:2:0,84
- (Grinding stops)
- Well?


26
0:2:0,84 --> 0:2:4,84
- (Grinding)
- (Drowned out)


27
0:2:4,84 --> 0:2:6,8
- (Grinding stops)
- What?


28
0:2:6,8 --> 0:2:10,12
(Drowned out by grinding)


29
0:2:10,12 --> 0:2:12,16
Just wait!


30
0:2:12,16 --> 0:2:15,96
(Grinding stops)


31
0:2:15,96 --> 0:2:19,28
(Grinding resumes)


32
0:2:19,28 --> 0:2:21,32
So what did he say?


33
0:2:21,32 --> 0:2:24,76
He'll start again after lunch,
it'll get worse tomorrow.


34
0:2:24,76 --> 0:2:29,4
- They wake you?
- Seven o'clock. I was doing my t'ai chi.


35
0:2:29,4 --> 0:2:32,56
It's not actually illegal to kill a builder.


36
0:2:32,56 --> 0:2:35,8
Hey, hey, hey! It's Sunday, right?


37
0:2:35,8 --> 0:2:37,12
- Yes.
- And we want to get away?


38
0:2:37,12 --> 0:2:39,36
- Yes.
- Why don't we...


39
0:2:39,36 --> 0:2:42,28
go to the park?


40
0:2:42,28 --> 0:2:47,72
Did that suggestion
deserve the preface "Hey, hey, hey"?


41
0:2:47,72 --> 0:2:51,88
- What about the cinema?
- Let's see.


42
0:2:51,88 --> 0:2:54,4
OK, how about this?


43
0:2:54,4 --> 0:2:58,16
"Bouffant. Sandra Bullock sets
up a tiny hairdresser's


44
0:2:58,16 --> 0:3:0,32
"in the trenches of the First World War."


45
0:3:0,32 --> 0:3:4,92
- No.
- What else?


46
0:3:4,92 --> 0:3:6,96
Here we go - "Regression.


47
0:3:6,96 --> 0:3:10,2
"Richard Gere kills himself
to go into the past


48
0:3:10,2 --> 0:3:13,92
"to rescue himself as a child
so he can grow up to kill himself


49
0:3:13,92 --> 0:3:16,6
"to rescue himself as a child
so he can..."


50
0:3:16,6 --> 0:3:18,84
- No!
- There must be something else.


51
0:3:18,84 --> 0:3:20,88
What's this?


52
0:3:20,88 --> 0:3:24,24
"Blue Tunes. Matt Damon,
Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver."


53
0:3:24,24 --> 0:3:27,12
- I hate her.
- "Grouchy Leonard Blue


54
0:3:27,12 --> 0:3:31,4
"runs a record shop with halfwit
moustachioed assistant Danny."


55
0:3:31,4 --> 0:3:33,12
Ha!


56
0:3:33,12 --> 0:3:36,52
"When they team up
with neurotic neighbour Pam


57
0:3:36,52 --> 0:3:38,88
"things become a riot of laughs."


58
0:3:38,88 --> 0:3:41,72
Where do they get this crap?
A child could...


59
0:3:41,72 --> 0:3:44,24
- They think we're idiots.
- Wankers.


60
0:3:44,24 --> 0:3:46,28
They all think they're great.


61
0:3:46,28 --> 0:3:49,84
(Sighs) We have to do something.


62
0:3:49,84 --> 0:3:51,68
Er, the usual, please.


63
0:3:51,68 --> 0:3:55,36
- What is your usual?
- I haven't decided yet.


64
0:3:55,36 --> 0:3:58,64
I quite like the idea
of asking for the usual.


65
0:3:58,64 --> 0:4:2,28
Come on, let's get back.
He must be gone, it's lunch.


66
0:4:2,28 --> 0:4:4,32
The usual.


67
0:4:4,32 --> 0:4:7,12
(American accent) Hey, the usual, please.


68
0:4:7,12 --> 0:4:9,16
Er, usual, please.


69
0:4:9,16 --> 0:4:16,52
(Posh accent) Can I have the usual?
Usual, please.


70
0:4:16,52 --> 0:4:20,32
(Whirring and banging)


71
0:4:20,32 --> 0:4:22,36
We have to do something!


72
0:4:22,36 --> 0:4:24,6
Let's go out for Sunday lunch.


73
0:4:24,6 --> 0:4:26,6
- All right.
- Where? Where?


74
0:4:26,6 --> 0:4:31,0
There's this new place, very in -
The Mortuary.


75
0:4:31,0 --> 0:4:36,4
No vegetables, everything's
dead animals on little headstones.


76
0:4:36,4 --> 0:4:38,64
Why does it have to be fancy?


77
0:4:38,64 --> 0:4:41,64
I just want sausage, mash
and a bit of cake.


78
0:4:41,64 --> 0:4:45,48
Not twigs fried in honey
or a donkey in a coffin.


79
0:4:45,48 --> 0:4:48,72
Let's go to that place
that does chicken and things.


80
0:4:48,72 --> 0:4:52,68
- OK. Oh, what shall we wear?
- Excuse me?


81
0:4:52,68 --> 0:4:55,48
- What sort of place is it?
- A restaurant.


82
0:4:55,48 --> 0:4:59,2
Shall we dress up or down?
- You can dress upside down, inside out,


83
0:4:59,2 --> 0:5:1,92
you'll still eat your spaghetti like a pig.


84
0:5:1,92 --> 0:5:4,84
- Can we just go to lunch?
- Give us a minute,


85
0:5:4,84 --> 0:5:9,16
I have to get my contact lenses.


86
0:5:9,16 --> 0:5:20,44
(Banging)


87
0:5:20,44 --> 0:5:23,56
Ber... Ber-Ber-Ber-Ber-Ber-Ber-Ber...


88
0:5:23,56 --> 0:5:25,64
Fix her, will you?


89
0:5:25,64 --> 0:5:31,4
Ber-Ber-Bernard, they're building for
two weeks, there's a sign. We can't stay.


90
0:5:31,4 --> 0:5:34,16
- (Grinding)
- I'll sort them out later.


91
0:5:34,16 --> 0:5:36,88
- What are you gonna do?
- What can you do?


92
0:5:36,88 --> 0:5:38,92
I'll write to the council.


93
0:5:38,92 --> 0:5:44,0
- What are you gonna say?
- I'll say, "Dear Council...


94
0:5:44,0 --> 0:5:48,24
"Please don't build beside us
for the next two weeks."


95
0:5:48,24 --> 0:5:51,84
- What if that doesn't work?
- Yeah, what are you gonna do?


96
0:5:51,84 --> 0:5:54,0
- Wanna know what I'll do?
- Yeah.


97
0:5:54,0 --> 0:5:56,76
I will... drink heavily and shout at you!


98
0:5:56,76 --> 0:6:0,88
- (Grinding)
- But I won't hear cos I'll be in Drillsville!


99
0:6:0,88 --> 0:6:2,84
Then I'll write to you as well!


100
0:6:2,84 --> 0:6:5,76
- (Grinding stops)
- We'll have to go away.


101
0:6:5,76 --> 0:6:9,16
It's perfect,
it's a good excuse to have a holiday.


102
0:6:9,16 --> 0:6:11,56
- Come on, we all need a change.
- (Grinding)


103
0:6:11,56 --> 0:6:13,36
We're not going anywhere!


104
0:6:13,36 --> 0:6:16,2
- This place'll be hell.
- I am not going on holiday.


105
0:6:16,2 --> 0:6:20,24
- Wait.
- (Grinding stops)


106
0:6:20,24 --> 0:6:22,12
Look, look.


107
0:6:22,12 --> 0:6:24,32
- What's this?
- Photos of my trip.


108
0:6:24,32 --> 0:6:26,8
Ooh, it's lovely. Is it Bali?


109
0:6:26,8 --> 0:6:30,56
- Mauritius. Well? Well?
- What?


110
0:6:30,56 --> 0:6:33,12
They're like any holiday photographs,


111
0:6:33,12 --> 0:6:37,12
people stood about squinting
who didn't realise they were that fat.


112
0:6:37,12 --> 0:6:41,64
That's us outside a restaurant.
And that's us outside a hotel.


113
0:6:41,64 --> 0:6:44,32
Whoo! What a transformation!


114
0:6:44,32 --> 0:6:47,6
Oh, and - ha - that's Eddie,
he was our map reader,


115
0:6:47,6 --> 0:6:53,4
he's a gallery owner
but, er, he lives in Kent.


116
0:6:53,4 --> 0:6:55,72
This is the only one of the whole group.


117
0:6:55,72 --> 0:7:2,6
Probably one of the few times in my life
when I've been truly happy.


118
0:7:2,6 --> 0:7:6,36
Why are you showing me these?
I don't know these people.


119
0:7:6,36 --> 0:7:9,12
The only use
this photograph would be to me


120
0:7:9,12 --> 0:7:13,16
would be if I was a hit man
and somebody asked me to kill Eddie,


121
0:7:13,16 --> 0:7:15,32
the gallery owner from Trent.


122
0:7:15,32 --> 0:7:17,48
- Kent.
- I don't care!


123
0:7:17,48 --> 0:7:19,52
- I'm not going.
- Fine.


124
0:7:19,52 --> 0:7:23,8
We'll go. You stay
and get your head drilled to bits.


125
0:7:23,8 --> 0:7:26,72
We are going to sunbathe, read,
and have silly drinks on a beach.


126
0:7:26,72 --> 0:7:29,0
Beach? No! I want the unknown -


127
0:7:29,0 --> 0:7:32,6
mystery, strange places, snakes, jungle.


128
0:7:32,6 --> 0:7:36,4
Manny, I am not going
to spend my holiday in a snake pit.


129
0:7:36,4 --> 0:7:40,92
- Shut up. Where's this sign?
- Outside.


130
0:7:40,92 --> 0:7:44,4
There must be somewhere
that has jungle AND beach.


131
0:7:44,4 --> 0:7:47,72
What do you do in there,
anyway, in a jungle?


132
0:7:47,72 --> 0:7:51,76
Well, you see how many miles
you can walk in a day.


133
0:7:51,76 --> 0:7:55,44
Yeah, but the heat -
you must get so dehydrated.


134
0:7:55,44 --> 0:7:59,76
Yeah, well, in a tight spot
you can always drink your own urine.


135
0:7:59,76 --> 0:8:3,64
Yeah, but what about the insects?
And how do you wash?


136
0:8:3,64 --> 0:8:17,72
That's not such a big priority when
you're quaffing pints of your own whizz.


137
0:8:17,72 --> 0:8:30,64
Excuse me, sorry.
Could I just...? Thank you.


138
0:8:30,64 --> 0:8:44,56
Thanks.


139
0:8:44,56 --> 0:8:46,68
- Perfect.
- I'll sort it.


140
0:8:46,68 --> 0:8:49,6
Don't get ripped off. Book it after lunch.


141
0:8:49,6 --> 0:8:51,64
Forget lunch.


142
0:8:51,64 --> 0:8:55,32
- And I'm not going to Thailand.
- You said you weren't going anywhere.


143
0:8:55,32 --> 0:8:58,88
Doo-dah didn't say they're
building round the clock.


144
0:8:58,88 --> 0:9:0,92
So forget beaches and jungles,


145
0:9:0,92 --> 0:9:4,76
we're going where I can read, sit,
and have a quiet drink.


146
0:9:4,76 --> 0:9:7,8
So your ideal holiday
would in fact be here?


147
0:9:7,8 --> 0:9:11,92
Correct.
So find somewhere exactly like this.


148
0:9:11,92 --> 0:9:14,4
With a jungle.


149
0:9:14,4 --> 0:9:17,52
And a bit of beach?
We're never gonna find anything.


150
0:9:17,52 --> 0:9:21,8
Here we are -
"The sunlit island of Saint-Honoré.


151
0:9:21,8 --> 0:9:24,0
"A tropical jungle
engirdled with golden sands


152
0:9:24,0 --> 0:9:28,28
"boasting the hemisphere's
only English book shop and bar."


153
0:9:28,28 --> 0:9:31,76
- I suppose that'll have to do.
- And it's got a website.


154
0:9:31,76 --> 0:9:34,88
Manny, do the flights.
I'll get the essentials.


155
0:9:34,88 --> 0:9:38,2
- Where are you going?
- To pack. Back in two minutes.


156
0:9:38,2 --> 0:9:41,52
Right. Better get cracking.
Get the suitcase...


157
0:9:41,52 --> 0:9:45,76
(Whirring)


158
0:9:45,76 --> 0:9:47,84
Right, what do we need?


159
0:9:47,84 --> 0:9:50,52
What do we need? Ah.


160
0:9:50,52 --> 0:9:53,28
Sun cream, first-aid kit, sunglasses,


161
0:9:53,28 --> 0:9:57,44
cologne, and... yep.


162
0:9:57,44 --> 0:10:4,28
Get rid of the rubbish.


163
0:10:4,28 --> 0:10:7,76
Good, you're putting stuff in.
Thanks for helping.


164
0:10:7,76 --> 0:10:11,2
Phrase books,
traveller's cheques, insect stuff...


165
0:10:11,2 --> 0:10:13,44
- Music!
- Music, good point.


166
0:10:13,44 --> 0:10:16,88
- (Drilling)
- CD player, CDs...


167
0:10:16,88 --> 0:10:25,24
and... clothes.


168
0:10:25,24 --> 0:10:26,72
Crap.


169
0:10:26,72 --> 0:10:32,56
Crap, crap, crap, crap.


170
0:10:32,56 --> 0:10:40,64
Right. And very important - malaria pills.


171
0:10:40,64 --> 0:10:42,68
- Right.
- Good thinking.


172
0:10:42,68 --> 0:10:47,44
- Would you get the corkscrew?
- Yep.


173
0:10:47,44 --> 0:10:49,32
There you go.


174
0:10:49,32 --> 0:10:54,4
Now, that's what I call teamwork.


175
0:10:54,4 --> 0:11:11,72
(Crash)


176
0:11:11,72 --> 0:11:13,84
- You done?
- You've been ages!


177
0:11:13,84 --> 0:11:15,88
What's in the bag?


178
0:11:15,88 --> 0:11:19,92
(Panting) Oh, it's nothing.
Just, you know, women's bits.


179
0:11:19,92 --> 0:11:23,12
Walk away from the bag.


180
0:11:23,12 --> 0:11:27,76
Manny.


181
0:11:27,76 --> 0:11:30,16
No! Don't open it! It's private!


182
0:11:30,16 --> 0:11:33,4
It's girls' things! No!


183
0:11:33,4 --> 0:11:35,96
Just as I thought! Put her in the chair.


184
0:11:35,96 --> 0:11:48,64
No! No! No! No!


185
0:11:48,64 --> 0:11:50,68
We're here to help you.


186
0:11:50,68 --> 0:11:52,68
You don't understand.


187
0:11:52,68 --> 0:12:3,16
We understand that you're ill.


188
0:12:3,16 --> 0:12:11,16
When you've learned to be sensible,
you can have this.


189
0:12:11,16 --> 0:12:14,32
- You don't really need these.
- Of course I do.


190
0:12:14,32 --> 0:12:17,68
They're my slow dancing mules.


191
0:12:17,68 --> 0:12:19,8
And you don't need these.


192
0:12:19,8 --> 0:12:25,12
I do. Suppose we're invited to a...
yacht party by drug dealers.


193
0:12:25,12 --> 0:12:27,16
Two pairs, more than you need.


194
0:12:27,16 --> 0:12:31,96
Just one more! Take something else out.


195
0:12:31,96 --> 0:12:37,8
No, contact lenses and
emergency money, throw it away.


196
0:12:37,8 --> 0:12:39,12
Erm, erm... Show me those.


197
0:12:39,12 --> 0:12:42,88
Those. And those. Those.


198
0:12:42,88 --> 0:12:46,64
You can take one pair.


199
0:12:46,64 --> 0:12:50,0
Oh, I... I can't decide.


200
0:12:50,0 --> 0:12:52,32
You can't make me choose.


201
0:12:52,32 --> 0:12:54,76
What's it to be? One pair! Come on!


202
0:12:54,76 --> 0:12:57,72
Oh, erm...
Well, those ones are comfortable.


203
0:12:57,72 --> 0:12:59,92
- Right, in they go.
- No! Wait!


204
0:12:59,92 --> 0:13:3,4
- Show me those ones again.
- These are weird.


205
0:13:3,4 --> 0:13:6,64
They are beautiful.


206
0:13:6,64 --> 0:13:10,68
They make strong men cry
in train stations. Put them in.


207
0:13:10,68 --> 0:13:14,48
Right, well, that's your lot.


208
0:13:14,48 --> 0:13:16,52
Bernard, got your passport?


209
0:13:16,52 --> 0:13:18,56
For God's sake, of course I do.


210
0:13:18,56 --> 0:13:20,68
Actually, I don't. Go and get it.


211
0:13:20,68 --> 0:13:25,52
- Where is it?
- Where does anybody keep them?


212
0:13:25,52 --> 0:13:28,12
It's in the... building.


213
0:13:28,12 --> 0:13:31,64
Bernard, go and get it.
We all have to work together.


214
0:13:31,64 --> 0:13:34,8
All right, all right.


215
0:13:34,8 --> 0:13:36,12
So, we have everything?


216
0:13:36,12 --> 0:13:40,32
Yep, let's just check the list
to be double super-safety sure.


217
0:13:40,32 --> 0:13:43,16
I'll stop you if we've missed something.


218
0:13:43,16 --> 0:13:46,12
Right, OK. 1950s-style windbreaker


219
0:13:46,12 --> 0:13:49,36
with two-tone lining and self-stripe cuffs.


220
0:13:49,36 --> 0:13:52,36
- Sta-Prest peach slacks...
- Manny.


221
0:13:52,36 --> 0:13:54,4
Let's just say clothes.


222
0:13:54,4 --> 0:13:57,12
Yeah, all right. Done.


223
0:13:57,12 --> 0:14:0,96
We have traveller's cheques, insurance,
Bernard's getting his passport.


224
0:14:0,96 --> 0:14:3,4
Sun screen,
insect repellent, phrase books?


225
0:14:3,4 --> 0:14:5,2
- Jawohl.
- Booked the taxi?


226
0:14:5,2 --> 0:14:7,96
- Done!
- Saint-Honoré here we come!


227
0:14:7,96 --> 0:14:10,16
What time is the flight?


228
0:14:10,16 --> 0:14:13,96
The... Hmm?


229
0:14:13,96 --> 0:14:16,8
You didn't book the flights.


230
0:14:16,8 --> 0:14:18,84
I'm so sorry, I got distracted by the...


231
0:14:18,84 --> 0:14:22,8
And, erm...


232
0:14:22,8 --> 0:14:26,68
My... my pants aren't that easy to fold.


233
0:14:26,68 --> 0:14:30,4
Not a problem. It's on the net, you said.


234
0:14:30,4 --> 0:14:37,28
Yeah. Easy, easy.


235
0:14:37,28 --> 0:14:40,8
(Beeping, dialling)


236
0:14:40,8 --> 0:14:46,32
(Data transfer noise)


237
0:14:46,32 --> 0:14:48,44
OK, what's the name of the site?


238
0:14:48,44 --> 0:14:54,28
Er, yeah, I know, it's, erm...
Holiday... ding dot thing.


239
0:14:54,28 --> 0:14:58,12
Er, no, no. Erm... Holiday at...


240
0:14:58,12 --> 0:15:1,8
dot...


241
0:15:1,8 --> 0:15:8,56
...holiday. Quick, quick.


242
0:15:8,56 --> 0:15:13,44
I wanted it to be safe.


243
0:15:13,44 --> 0:15:17,96
Ha!


244
0:15:17,96 --> 0:15:21,68
No, that's not it.
This button doesn't work, look.


245
0:15:21,68 --> 0:15:25,36
You are pressing my hand.


246
0:15:25,36 --> 0:15:28,52
Manny, you must remember
the name of the site.


247
0:15:28,52 --> 0:15:32,4
Ah! Naughty little passport.


248
0:15:32,4 --> 0:15:51,84
Hiding in the crisps again!


249
0:15:51,84 --> 0:15:57,56
Manny, we have been
doing this now for five hours.


250
0:15:57,56 --> 0:16:0,56
Where did you see the name of the site?


251
0:16:0,56 --> 0:16:2,96
- In the papers.
- Which bit?


252
0:16:2,96 --> 0:16:4,64
The travel section.


253
0:16:4,64 --> 0:16:7,72
Which is open
just there on the top, isn't it?


254
0:16:7,72 --> 0:16:12,28
Yep, yep.


255
0:16:12,28 --> 0:16:16,16
Could you read the ad out
from the paper to me, please?


256
0:16:16,16 --> 0:16:20,44
"Fly-Saint-Honoré. Com."


257
0:16:20,44 --> 0:16:25,44
I had it in my hand.
I wanted it to be safe.


258
0:16:25,44 --> 0:16:28,88
I went over here...


259
0:16:28,88 --> 0:16:31,16
- Where can it be?
- Right, got it.


260
0:16:31,16 --> 0:16:34,84
- Oh, Fran, you're a genius.
- We can't go, I've no passport.


261
0:16:34,84 --> 0:16:37,24
- Have you checked your desk?
- What? No.


262
0:16:37,24 --> 0:16:42,0
Oh, yes, there it is.


263
0:16:42,0 --> 0:16:45,6
Right. Sorted.
We've got a bargain. Better go to bed,


264
0:16:45,6 --> 0:16:48,28
it's an early flight, saves us money.


265
0:16:48,28 --> 0:16:51,0
- I'll get us up.
- No. You can't be trusted.


266
0:16:51,0 --> 0:16:54,32
- I'm staying awake.
- Yeah, I'd better kip here.


267
0:16:54,32 --> 0:16:57,16
- Can I have your bed?
- Yeah.


268
0:16:57,16 --> 0:17:3,6
- Got any bin liners?
- In the kitchen.


269
0:17:3,6 --> 0:17:7,52
- And, er, Dettol?
- Under the sink.


270
0:17:7,52 --> 0:17:9,56
- Ajax?
- Yeah, just here.


271
0:17:9,56 --> 0:17:11,36
Thanks.


272
0:17:11,36 --> 0:17:14,56
Are you really actually
gonna get in the bed?


273
0:17:14,56 --> 0:17:16,84
- Yeah.
- Right. Erm...


274
0:17:16,84 --> 0:17:19,2
- Take these.
- No, I'm not hungry.


275
0:17:19,2 --> 0:17:22,6
No, it's not for you.
Just chuck 'em under the bed.


276
0:17:22,6 --> 0:17:25,88
What...? What's... what's under the bed?


277
0:17:25,88 --> 0:17:28,76
Dunno.


278
0:17:28,76 --> 0:17:36,4
We just call it the Thing.


279
0:17:36,4 --> 0:17:39,8
(Bernard moans)


280
0:17:39,8 --> 0:17:52,64
(Car horn toots)


281
0:17:52,64 --> 0:17:55,8
- Come on, come on!
- Come on!


282
0:17:55,8 --> 0:17:56,92
Wake up! Wake up! Get up!


283
0:17:56,92 --> 0:17:58,6
Cab's outside, come on!


284
0:17:58,6 --> 0:18:0,76
Hmm? Come on! Hmm?


285
0:18:0,76 --> 0:18:3,4
Final check. Final.


286
0:18:3,4 --> 0:18:4,72
Good.


287
0:18:4,72 --> 0:18:7,2
Good. Come on!


288
0:18:7,2 --> 0:18:9,4
Come on!


289
0:18:9,4 --> 0:18:13,96
Wake up! Get up!


290
0:18:13,96 --> 0:18:16,16
Listen, there's a slight catch.


291
0:18:16,16 --> 0:18:18,48
These flights are very cheap.


292
0:18:18,48 --> 0:18:20,52
Four quid each.


293
0:18:20,52 --> 0:18:22,56
Quite reasonable, yes.


294
0:18:22,56 --> 0:18:25,12
So we have to make
a couple of changeovers.


295
0:18:25,12 --> 0:18:29,24
- (Bernard) How does that work?
- Well, to get to the Canaries


296
0:18:29,24 --> 0:18:31,28
we have to change...


297
0:18:31,28 --> 0:18:33,52
(Clears throat)... in New Zealand.


298
0:18:33,52 --> 0:18:35,72
What? That's practically in France!


299
0:18:35,72 --> 0:18:38,72
- I know.
- Why don't we just go there?


300
0:18:38,72 --> 0:18:42,8
We could have sake at the rodeo
and go home on a sled with camels.


301
0:18:42,8 --> 0:18:44,12
We're just refuelling.


302
0:18:44,12 --> 0:18:46,16
And then we change again at...


303
0:18:46,16 --> 0:18:48,2
(Clears throat)... Stansted.


304
0:18:48,2 --> 0:18:50,32
I've always wanted to go there.


305
0:18:50,32 --> 0:18:53,56
- Nice, is it?
- They've got these trains


306
0:18:53,56 --> 0:18:55,76
that have no driver.


307
0:18:55,76 --> 0:18:58,4
Ah? Have they?


308
0:18:58,4 --> 0:19:0,56
We'll just be there for a few days.


309
0:19:0,56 --> 0:19:2,6
In and around the airport.


310
0:19:2,6 --> 0:19:6,84
- In, mostly.
- That's where the trains are.


311
0:19:6,84 --> 0:19:10,44
And then it's straight on
to sunny Saint-Honoré!


312
0:19:10,44 --> 0:19:14,24
(PA) 'Would passengers Black,
Bianco and Katzenjammer


313
0:19:14,24 --> 0:19:16,68
- 'please go to gate 4.'
- That's us.


314
0:19:16,68 --> 0:19:19,8
Wait, wait. Let's see if they do it again.


315
0:19:19,8 --> 0:19:23,4
'Passengers Black,
Bianco and Katzenjammer,


316
0:19:23,4 --> 0:19:35,4
- 'please go to gate 4 now.'
- (AII cheer)


317
0:19:35,4 --> 0:19:38,68
It must be the last connection.
We must be nearly home.


318
0:19:38,68 --> 0:19:41,2
- Is this Prague?
- I don't care.


319
0:19:41,2 --> 0:19:43,56
I'm not getting on another plane.


320
0:19:43,56 --> 0:19:45,96
I think this is Miami.


321
0:19:45,96 --> 0:19:49,52
Fine. I'm gonna live here
and sell guns to children.


322
0:19:49,52 --> 0:19:52,72
- You liked Saint-Honoré.
- I did!


323
0:19:52,72 --> 0:19:55,68
I thoroughly enjoyed
our four hours there.


324
0:19:55,68 --> 0:19:58,2
You can't say the flights weren't cheap.


325
0:19:58,2 --> 0:20:2,28
And you can't say
we didn't spend 13 days on a plane.


326
0:20:2,28 --> 0:20:4,36
574.


327
0:20:4,36 --> 0:20:7,88
574 what?


328
0:20:7,88 --> 0:20:10,44
I kept them all.


329
0:20:10,44 --> 0:20:14,72
574 of these little towel things.


330
0:20:14,72 --> 0:20:16,76
Let's get a drink.


331
0:20:16,76 --> 0:20:20,12
This might be Nairobi.


332
0:20:20,12 --> 0:20:22,48
No, it's definitely Minsk.


333
0:20:22,48 --> 0:20:24,76
You're both wrong. It's obvious.


334
0:20:24,76 --> 0:20:30,84
He's got all the trademark piercings.


335
0:20:30,84 --> 0:20:37,96
Hakim yoba hara hakhyakh!


336
0:20:37,96 --> 0:20:42,8
Uloddivisholov neinsbar.


337
0:20:42,8 --> 0:20:44,84
(Clears throat)


338
0:20:44,84 --> 0:20:49,24
Anvill kerrigan godean lethes.


339
0:20:49,24 --> 0:20:51,76
(SIowly) Where are we?


340
0:20:51,76 --> 0:20:55,16
- Heathrow, love.
- Oh, hey, we're home!


341
0:20:55,16 --> 0:20:58,56
Ohhh. Erm,
three glasses of Merlot, please.


342
0:20:58,56 --> 0:21:0,24
(Sighs)


343
0:21:0,24 --> 0:21:4,28
Oh, don't look at me like that.
Hey, it wasn't all bad.


344
0:21:4,28 --> 0:21:8,4
How many people can say
they've been on a hospital river boat?


345
0:21:8,4 --> 0:21:12,44
And you can be sure they didn't
get to operate on themselves.


346
0:21:12,44 --> 0:21:15,28
Just as well
they thought Manny was a god.


347
0:21:15,28 --> 0:21:19,32
It'll be some time before
I want to sacrifice another monkey.


348
0:21:19,32 --> 0:21:22,68
We said we wouldn't talk about Canada!


349
0:21:22,68 --> 0:21:24,68
Let's go home.


350
0:21:24,68 --> 0:21:26,96
- Have you got your keys?
- No.


351
0:21:26,96 --> 0:21:30,48
I left them in the bag
which you kindly lost.


352
0:21:30,48 --> 0:21:32,52
Ah.


353
0:21:32,52 --> 0:21:34,56
What do you mean, "Ah"?


354
0:21:34,56 --> 0:21:36,52
Well, I think that...


355
0:21:36,52 --> 0:21:38,56
my keys were in there as well.


356
0:21:38,56 --> 0:21:41,44
Were they? Funny, isn't it, travel?


357
0:21:41,44 --> 0:21:43,48
Just one thing after another.


358
0:21:43,48 --> 0:21:45,88
- You're fired.
- Oh, now, look.


359
0:21:45,88 --> 0:21:49,4
And after I dislodge
and return your thong,


360
0:21:49,4 --> 0:21:56,12
I never want to see you again either.


361
0:21:56,12 --> 0:21:58,64
(Grunts)


362
0:21:58,64 --> 0:22:0,36
Do you want to jump?


363
0:22:0,36 --> 0:22:3,8
- I came down gradually...
- Get away from me!


364
0:22:3,8 --> 0:22:7,84
It was a thrill to recreate with you
but now our association ends.


365
0:22:7,84 --> 0:22:11,72
You have brought nothing
but pain, penury


366
0:22:11,72 --> 0:22:14,4
and strife into my days.


367
0:22:14,4 --> 0:22:17,36
I wish you good fortune
in whatever avenue of life


368
0:22:17,36 --> 0:22:19,92
you assault with your presence.


369
0:22:19,92 --> 0:22:22,8
Here's your redundancy package.


370
0:22:22,8 --> 0:22:24,76
Sorry it's in Phrenobian wooden dollars


371
0:22:24,76 --> 0:22:26,88
but that's largely your fault!


372
0:22:26,88 --> 0:22:29,4
Now, good luck and goodbye!


373
0:22:29,4 --> 0:22:31,84
You can't run the place on your own.


374
0:22:31,84 --> 0:22:37,28
I'll struggle on somehow.


375
0:22:37,28 --> 0:22:39,36
No. I don't accept your apology.


376
0:22:39,36 --> 0:22:41,88
Give it another 30 years.
And take this with you.


377
0:22:41,88 --> 0:22:44,16
- Bernard.
- What?


378
0:22:44,16 --> 0:22:46,92
- Do you want to come outside?
- I'm cold.


379
0:22:46,92 --> 0:22:50,8
I have got chilblains, tinnitus and thrush!


380
0:22:50,8 --> 0:23:9,0
If you want to fight, come inside.


381
0:23:9,0 --> 0:23:14,76
(Maniacal giggling)


382
0:23:14,76 --> 0:23:18,36
(Simian gibbering)


383
0:23:18,36 --> 0:23:21,64
The noise. Th-th-th-th-the noise!


384
0:23:21,64 --> 0:23:23,76
B-b-b-b-b-b-but found it.


385
0:23:23,76 --> 0:23:32,48
Found it! I found it!


386
0:23:32,48 --> 0:23:36,52
Manny, could you look after the shop
