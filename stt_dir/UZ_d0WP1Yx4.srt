ADRI MURGUIA: After settling in
on Faustino's land, we went


7
0:0:59,33 --> 0:1:0,91
back to meet with him.


8
0:1:0,91 --> 0:1:3,72
Our first impressions so far
were positive, despite what we


9
0:1:3,72 --> 0:1:7,18
had heard from his relatives.


10
0:1:7,18 --> 0:1:10,19
We wanted to understand how he
had managed to survive out


11
0:1:10,19 --> 0:1:12,735
here on his own for
over four decades.

ADRI MURGUIA: Augusto Pinochet
ruled Chile with an iron fist


17
0:2:5,62 --> 0:2:8,261
from 1973 to 1990.


18
0:2:8,261 --> 0:2:10,87
During this time, hundreds of
thousands of people were


19
0:2:10,87 --> 0:2:12,46
forced to leave the country
in the wake


20
0:2:12,46 --> 0:2:14,6
of an economic crisis.


21
0:2:14,6 --> 0:2:17,48
Faustino was part of
this migration.

24
0:2:33,77 --> 0:2:36,24
ADRI MURGUIA: When Faustino
returned to Chile, he used the


25
0:2:36,24 --> 0:2:38,94
skills he picked up in Argentina
to build his first


26
0:2:38,94 --> 0:2:42,24
home on the other end of this
property, by an area known as


27
0:2:42,24 --> 0:2:43,37
the Green Lake.


28
0:2:43,37 --> 0:2:46,33

to help them survive

ADRI MURGUIA: Since his return
from Argentina, Faustino has


34
0:4:39,59 --> 0:4:41,29
not travelled beyond
Villa O'Higgins.


35
0:4:41,29 --> 0:4:43,16
But he manages to stay in touch
with the rest of the


36
0:4:43,16 --> 0:4:46,22
world through radio broadcasts
and by reading newspapers that


37
0:4:46,22 --> 0:4:48,26
he gets once or twice a year.


38
0:4:48,26 --> 0:4:50,47
He's watched TV maybe
once in his life.


39
0:4:50,47 --> 0:4:52,41

than the average
