10
0:0:47,0 --> 0:0:49,465
the director of the
documentary Hori


11
0:0:49,465 --> 0:0:51,46
Smoku Sailor Jerry.


12
0:0:51,46 --> 0:0:54,212
It's a documentary about the
life and times of Sailor Jerry


13
0:0:54,212 --> 0:0:59,29
Collins, who is a infamous
tattoo artist who was based in


14
0:0:59,29 --> 0:1:5,379
Honolulu, Hawaii from the late
'20s to when he died in 1973.


15
0:1:5,379 --> 0:1:8,88
I think during the movie, my
image of Hawaii kind of


16
0:1:8,88 --> 0:1:10,32
changed and shifted.


17
0:1:10,32 --> 0:1:11,97
Because I'm from
the East Coast.


18
0:1:11,97 --> 0:1:14,89
I'm from Philadelphia,
so Hawaii really is


19
0:1:14,89 --> 0:1:15,89
another world away.


20
0:1:15,89 --> 0:1:19,64
And when you think of Hawaii you
think of hula girls, and


21
0:1:19,64 --> 0:1:22,31
pig roasts, and that
kind of thing.


22
0:1:22,31 --> 0:1:26,25
And researching for the film,
I learned about where Jerry


23
0:1:26,25 --> 0:1:28,68
tattooed, and that was
Hotel Street, which


24
0:1:28,68 --> 0:1:30,87
is Chinatown area.


25
0:1:30,87 --> 0:1:33,95
And it's always been notorious,
because that's


26
0:1:33,95 --> 0:1:38,89
where soldiers and sailors
would go to drink, meet a


27
0:1:38,89 --> 0:1:44,25
lady, usually a lady for
hire, and get tattooed.


28
0:1:44,25 --> 0:1:47,8
And I listened to stories about
how seedy and dirty and


29
0:1:47,8 --> 0:1:49,455
dangerous that area was.


30
0:1:49,455 --> 0:1:51,4

40
0:2:26,84 --> 0:2:28,62
ERICH WEISS: There's a lot of
people that are still here


41
0:2:28,62 --> 0:2:30,47
that were tattooed
by Sailor Jerry.


42
0:2:30,47 --> 0:2:35,15
And you could find people that
worked in Jerry's shop just


43
0:2:35,15 --> 0:2:37,69
after when Mike Malone took
it over, and it was


44
0:2:37,69 --> 0:2:39,38
called China Sea then.


45
0:2:39,38 --> 0:2:42,16
So there are continuous lines of
history that you can follow


46
0:2:42,16 --> 0:2:46,86
and people that remember what
Hotel Street was like and what


47
0:2:46,86 --> 0:2:49,0
that era represented.

There's Mike Brown, who's
still working here.


49
0:2:53,52 --> 0:2:56,42
Around the '70s, I think that's
when Chinatown started


50
0:2:56,42 --> 0:2:58,0
to really go on its decline.


51
0:2:58,0 --> 0:3:1,79
And Mike Brown worked at China
Sea during that time period,


52
0:3:1,79 --> 0:3:3,325
and now he's working
in Waikiki.

are done on tourists.

turtles, koi fish.


59
0:3:30,6 --> 0:3:33,4

We do have guys that come in and
want a traditional-style


61

tattooing, and I can
do it, no problem.


62
0:3:41,65 --> 0:3:43,67
Because that's what I started
out doing was


63
0:3:43,67 --> 0:3:44,67
that style of work.


64
0:3:44,67 --> 0:3:48,94
So I have no problem
with that.


65
0:3:48,94 --> 0:3:53,24
I grew up in suburbs of Los
Angeles, a little town called


66
0:3:53,24 --> 0:3:54,5
Pico Rivera.


67
0:3:54,5 --> 0:3:57,31
Yeah, most of the people I hung
out with had tattoos.


68
0:3:57,31 --> 0:4:1,97
All the older guys did,
peacocks, like this.


69
0:4:1,97 --> 0:4:5,79
I think the peacock was the
most-used image at that time


70
0:4:5,79 --> 0:4:7,24
in the late '60s.


71
0:4:7,24 --> 0:4:10,6
I think that the old junkies
used to do it to hide their


72
0:4:10,6 --> 0:4:10,89
needle marks.


73
0:4:10,89 --> 0:4:12,63
That was the whole significance
of it.


74
0:4:12,63 --> 0:4:15,77
They'd get it, the body here,
and then the tail would come


75
0:4:15,77 --> 0:4:17,29
down there.


76
0:4:17,29 --> 0:4:24,7
And this arm was a little bit of
my recreational drug abuse


77
0:4:24,7 --> 0:4:29,52
caused me to have surgery
on my arms.


78
0:4:29,52 --> 0:4:31,62
Kids love it.


79
0:4:31,62 --> 0:4:35,84
Well, I was not doing real
good in California.


80
0:4:35,84 --> 0:4:37,9
I was--


81
0:4:37,9 --> 0:4:38,91



82
0:4:38,91 --> 0:4:40,58
oh, I guess everybody knows.


83
0:4:40,58 --> 0:4:43,22
I was a drug addict, and I
needed to get away from the


84
0:4:43,22 --> 0:4:44,22
drugs that were there.


85
0:4:44,22 --> 0:4:48,57
So I came here and got away
from those drugs and soon


86
0:4:48,57 --> 0:4:49,84
found other drugs here.


87
0:4:49,84 --> 0:4:54,89
But I would go through downtown
on my way to Waikiki,


88
0:4:54,89 --> 0:4:58,41
and I'd look down the street to
see if the shop was open.


89
0:4:58,41 --> 0:5:1,76
And it was never open, because
at that time, Mike Malone was


90
0:5:1,76 --> 0:5:6,14
in the process of opening the
shop after Sailor Jerry died.


91
0:5:6,14 --> 0:5:8,8
He had died in June, and
I moved here in the


92
0:5:8,8 --> 0:5:10,9
beginning of August.


93
0:5:10,9 --> 0:5:14,6
So it still had the Sailor
Jerry sign out front.


94
0:5:14,6 --> 0:5:15,73
So one day I walked into the--


95
0:5:15,73 --> 0:5:16,99
I noticed the shop was open.


96
0:5:16,99 --> 0:5:18,56
And I walked in and met Mike.


97
0:5:18,56 --> 0:5:21,63
Well, that was the only tattoo
scene that was going on here


98
0:5:21,63 --> 0:5:23,59
at that time in '73.


99
0:5:23,59 --> 0:5:25,91
So I just started coming
around the shop.


100
0:5:25,91 --> 0:5:28,8
And then from there, we started
hanging out together,


101
0:5:28,8 --> 0:5:31,32
because back in the old days,
in the '70s, there weren't a


102
0:5:31,32 --> 0:5:33,95
lot of haoles here,
or white people.


103
0:5:33,95 --> 0:5:39,16
We were definitely the minority
at that time, and so


104
0:5:39,16 --> 0:5:41,89
if you met somebody that was a
haole, and you were a haole,


105
0:5:41,89 --> 0:5:44,31
you sort of became friends with
them if you wanted to


106
0:5:44,31 --> 0:5:45,95
have friendship.


107
0:5:45,95 --> 0:5:48,927
Because the locals really didn't
take to us that good in


108
0:5:48,927 --> 0:5:50,0
those days.


109
0:5:50,0 --> 0:5:53,71
They were real hesitant, because
all the stigma of


110
0:5:53,71 --> 0:5:57,53
Captain Cook, and from then on
how they raped and pillaged


111
0:5:57,53 --> 0:6:0,1
the island.


112
0:6:0,1 --> 0:6:4,78
Before I started to tattooing,
came over here in '73, and I


113
0:6:4,78 --> 0:6:6,44
liked to eat sweets,
always have.


114
0:6:6,44 --> 0:6:8,48
So I decided, well, maybe
I'll be a baker.


115
0:6:8,48 --> 0:6:11,93
So I went to baking school
for a while.


116
0:6:11,93 --> 0:6:14,57
Then Malone set me up in a
doughnut shop across the


117
0:6:14,57 --> 0:6:19,6
street from the tattoo shop to
plug up the business for the


118
0:6:19,6 --> 0:6:21,79
other Filipino guy
used to work.


119
0:6:21,79 --> 0:6:26,14
I pursued baking for another few
years, and then come 1977,


120
0:6:26,14 --> 0:6:28,76
I was through with it.


121
0:6:28,76 --> 0:6:31,54
And I told Malone, teach
me how to tattoo.


122
0:6:31,54 --> 0:6:35,59
If I could see something, I
could copy it, but I wasn't


123
0:6:35,59 --> 0:6:38,577
always real good at making
stuff up out of my head.


124
0:6:38,577 --> 0:6:43,602
I've always had trouble
with that.


125
0:6:43,602 --> 0:6:47,4



126
0:6:47,4 --> 0:6:50,575
MIKE BROWN: Lance McClain, Kandi
Everett, Mike Malone,


127
0:6:50,575 --> 0:6:52,215
and myself, and that was it.


128
0:6:52,215 --> 0:6:56,2
Oh, Mike would be real friendly
on some days and real


129
0:6:56,2 --> 0:6:58,21
grumpy on other days.


130
0:6:58,21 --> 0:7:1,51
It would just depend on how it
was going for him that day.


131
0:7:1,51 --> 0:7:8,4



132
0:7:8,4 --> 0:7:11,92
MIKE BROWN: Well, real clean,
real bright, Sailor Jerry's


133
0:7:11,92 --> 0:7:13,35
designs, most of it.


134
0:7:13,35 --> 0:7:16,9
And then Mike had painted up
a lot of his designs too.


135
0:7:16,9 --> 0:7:21,23
But for some reason, we sold
a lot of the Sailor Jerry


136
0:7:21,23 --> 0:7:23,22
bulldogs and eagles.


137
0:7:23,22 --> 0:7:25,71
It just seemed like the
'70s, everybody wanted


138
0:7:25,71 --> 0:7:28,11
bulldogs and eagles.


139
0:7:28,11 --> 0:7:31,54
That was mainly what all
I did back then.


140
0:7:31,54 --> 0:7:37,8
But we did mostly Marines and
Navy on military paydays.


141
0:7:37,8 --> 0:7:40,35
Back then they got paid every
two weeks by cash.


142
0:7:40,35 --> 0:7:42,97
It was just production shop
on military payday.


143
0:7:42,97 --> 0:7:48,17
We'd do 10-15 people on a
12-hour shift, and you


144
0:7:48,17 --> 0:7:50,4
couldn't do any body work
in there when you


145
0:7:50,4 --> 0:7:52,48
had a military payday.


146
0:7:52,48 --> 0:7:54,83
All you did was backs
and arms.


147
0:7:54,83 --> 0:7:58,9
Back then, if you tattooed 3%
to 5% of the population, you


148
0:7:58,9 --> 0:8:1,62
were probably being
very liberal.


149
0:8:1,62 --> 0:8:4,65
It seemed like nobody got
tattooed back then.


150
0:8:4,65 --> 0:8:7,47
I'd get on the bus, and I had
this big dragon my arm.


151
0:8:7,47 --> 0:8:10,27
And little Chinese ladies
wouldn't even sit by me.


152
0:8:10,27 --> 0:8:11,7
They were afraid of me.


153
0:8:11,7 --> 0:8:16,34
I went to the first tattoo
convention in Reno, Nevada.


154
0:8:16,34 --> 0:8:19,72
It was before National Tattoo
Association started.


155
0:8:19,72 --> 0:8:21,94
So I went over there
with Mike.


156
0:8:21,94 --> 0:8:26,3
He had just finished my back
piece and wanted me to enter


157
0:8:26,3 --> 0:8:27,28
it in a contest.


158
0:8:27,28 --> 0:8:30,92
Went to the convention, and
I saw that tattooing was


159
0:8:30,92 --> 0:8:33,39
starting to get really good.


160
0:8:33,39 --> 0:8:36,0
And you could make a decent
living at it.


161
0:8:36,0 --> 0:8:39,82
Back then, there was only people
that were in the tattoo


162
0:8:39,82 --> 0:8:41,63
business were the only people
that came through


163
0:8:41,63 --> 0:8:43,6
the door, it seemed.


164
0:8:43,6 --> 0:8:46,45
Nobody made very much money,
because everybody was gambling


165
0:8:46,45 --> 0:8:48,245
that weekend.


166
0:8:48,245 --> 0:8:51,52
So it wasn't a real good idea to
have a tattoo convention in


167
0:8:51,52 --> 0:8:54,47
a place where they have
gambling, I don't think.


168
0:8:54,47 --> 0:8:57,866
Oh, Thom Devita was there.


169
0:8:57,866 --> 0:9:0,49
Huck Spaulding was there.


170
0:9:0,49 --> 0:9:4,18
And then Ed Hardy, and Mike
Malone, and I, and--


171
0:9:4,18 --> 0:9:4,71
that's right.


172
0:9:4,71 --> 0:9:8,16
Jack Rudy was there, and
Charlie Cartwright.


173
0:9:8,16 --> 0:9:9,53
He was a character.


174
0:9:9,53 --> 0:9:14,37
That's where Ed and Mike met
Jack Rudy and saw the work he


175
0:9:14,37 --> 0:9:17,5
was doing and were just blown
away by that single-needle


176
0:9:17,5 --> 0:9:19,15
work he was doing.


177
0:9:19,15 --> 0:9:19,67
Oh, yeah.


178
0:9:19,67 --> 0:9:22,58
We were doing four- and
five-needle outline tattoos,


179
0:9:22,58 --> 0:9:23,45
bright colors.


180
0:9:23,45 --> 0:9:27,15
They were doing all
single-needle, black and gray,


181
0:9:27,15 --> 0:9:28,54
using a shade or two.


182
0:9:28,54 --> 0:9:31,55
But it was all just black and
gray, real fine, more


183
0:9:31,55 --> 0:9:34,556
realistic than what
we were doing.


184
0:9:34,556 --> 0:9:39,16
Yeah, I moved back to the
mainland in 1979.


185
0:9:39,16 --> 0:9:43,35
I thought I could get a real job
for a while and realized


186
0:9:43,35 --> 0:9:44,29
it wasn't for me.


187
0:9:44,29 --> 0:9:47,36
So I went right back to
tattooing and started working


188
0:9:47,36 --> 0:9:53,2
for Ed Hardy at Tattooland in
East LA, the one that looks


189
0:9:53,2 --> 0:9:56,574
like a little gingerbread
house, yeah.


190
0:9:56,574 --> 0:9:59,89
Oh, there it was strictly
tattooing gang bangers.


191
0:9:59,89 --> 0:10:2,27
That's all we did was
just tattoo gang


192
0:10:2,27 --> 0:10:3,89
bangers, day and night.


193
0:10:3,89 --> 0:10:4,78
They didn't mind.


194
0:10:4,78 --> 0:10:8,92
They liked-- we were one
of the only shops.


195
0:10:8,92 --> 0:10:11,67
Freddy Negrete, he was the
only one that was--


196
0:10:11,67 --> 0:10:13,63
he grew up in the barrio.


197
0:10:13,63 --> 0:10:15,735
He was a gang banger
too at one time.


198
0:10:15,735 --> 0:10:20,43
And he was from South
San Gabriel--


199
0:10:20,43 --> 0:10:22,29
or no, San Gabriel, excuse me.


200
0:10:22,29 --> 0:10:25,49
I say South San Gabriel,
he'd get mad.


201
0:10:25,49 --> 0:10:28,86
He was from San Gabriel, or
Sangra, they called it.
