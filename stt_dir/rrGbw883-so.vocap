###4 Hey dad, do you know how to calculate the surface area of a cube?
###7 - Um, oh.
###9 You take the square root of somebody who knows,
###11 divide it by whatever you tried,
###12 and then ask your mother.
###14 - Ask me what?
###16 - Hey, babe.
###17 - Hmm.
###20 - Something wrong?
###21 - Not a thing.
###23 - You sure?
###24 - I'm fine.
###25 Ask me what?
###29 Is there a reason you're listening to music
###30 when you're supposed to be studying?
###32 Kevin.
###33 - He can't hear you.
###35 Those are noise-canceling headphones.
###39 - Oh.
###41 - Ask me what?
###41 - Oh, do you know how to calculate
###43 the surface area of a cube?
###44 - Take the length of one side squared
###46 and multiply it by six.
###48 You didn't know that?
###49 - Whoa, babe, we been through this before.
###51 Math is not my thing.
###52 If it was, I could figure out what's wrong with you.
###58 - Kevin, why didn't you ask Lindsey?
###59 She's done this stuff a lot more recently than I have.
###61 - I don't know.
###62 - Lindsey.
###64 - Yes?
###65 - Did you not see you brother
###66 sitting over here struggling?
###67 - I saw him sitting there.
###68 I didn't know he was struggling.
###70 - Well, since you're so unsure of what you're looking at,
###73 your job for the next week is to help Kevin with his homework.
###76 - But mom... - You want to make it two weeks?
###78 I didn't think so.
###81 Put that up.

###98 - Hey, Gigi.
###99 - Hey, Nick.
###100 - What's wrong with Suzanne?
###101 - Shh.
###108 Okay, your wife, she's upset.
###110 - I can see that.
###111 - Shh, man.
###113 This morning, we had a breakfast meeting
###115 with a potential client, a woman,
###117 throwing a post honeymoon party.
###119 Suzanne was fine until the woman asked her
###122 where she went on her honeymoon.
###123 So Suzanne tells her about this amazing trip
###127 she and you took to Hawaii.
###130 - We didn't go to Hawaii because we didn't go on a honeymoon.
###133 - That's right.
###134 - Y would Suzanne lie about going on a honeymoon?
###137 - Why wouldn't she like, Nick?
###138 I mean, you can safely assume not going on your honeymoon
###142 is like not doing something that would be really important
###145 to a man that he didn't do
###147 but was around a bunch of other men who did do it,
###149 and they were talking about it all the time.
###151 - Gigi, I promised Suzanne I would take her on a honeymoon,
###154 and I am taking her.
###155 - Then what are you waiting for, Nick?
###157 - I already got one wife. I don't need you on my back.
###159 - Well, you take her on that trip or I will.
###161 - Fine, Oprah, you take her.
###163 - Don't mock me.
###164 - I got this, Gigi.
###170 - And what did she say?
###171 And what did you say?
###173 Oh-ho, no!
###175 Oh-ho-ho, no!
###177 Oh-ho!
###178 Did Ralph call you?
###179 Oh-ho, that boy is on something.
###181 I'm telling you.
###182 No, no.
###183 Him and rere went in.
###184 Oh-ho, they went in.
###187 No, no, you on something, boy.
###189 No, boy, you on something!
###192 No, a'ight, a'ight, check it.
###194 Yeah, I got to do something real quick.
###195 I'll hit you back. I'll hit you back.
###197 A'ight.
###199 I'm really sorry about that.
###200 That was just...
###201 - Yeah, I know, I know.
###202 It's your boy. He's on something.
###205 So honeymoon.
###206 Any place in mind?
###208 - Someplace tropical.
###209 - Uh, let's see.
###211 Oh, yeah, here you go.
###212 Let's see.
###215 There we go.
###216 Six nights all inclusive
###218 at the Fiji grand tides.
###219 - Yeah, how much?
###221 - $8,442.
###223 - Boy, you on something.
###226 What can you do for 3,500
###227 broken down into 12 easy payments?
###230 - She like petting zoos?
###231 - No.
###232 - Civil war reenactments?
###234 - No.
###235 Look, I am looking for a nice romantic beach getaway.
###238 - Right, uh, oh, here, this is you.
###241 All inclusive Maui swimming with the dolphins honeymoon package,
###245 $1,500.
###246 - Man, what do I look like swimming with the dolphins?
###249 How am I supposed to take pictures of that?
###250 This is me. This is me and a dolphin.
###252 This is me and my wife and a dolphin.
###254 This is me and my wife.
###255 You know who took that picture? The dolphin.
###257 - No, you got it all wrong.
###259 You don't have to swim with the dolphins.
###261 You can just sit on the beach.
###262 I'll upgrade your room.
###264 What do you say?
###266 - Book it.
###267 - Great.
###268 Oh, uh, there is one catch.
###270 You have to leave Tuesday.
###273 Tuesday?
###275 As in Tuesday?
###276 - Yeah, Tuesday, this Tuesday.
###279 Oh-ho.
###280 - No. Brad is busy.
###283 Who is this?
###284 Rere?
###285 - Oh-ho-ho, rere went in.
###288 I call you back, Shawty.
###293 - Nick.
###294 Honey.
###296 Babe, can you please help me zip up my dress?
###298 - Oh, no problem.
###301 There you go.
###302 - Thank you.
###303 - Babe? - Huh? Yes?
###305 - You seem a little out of sorts.
###307 Is everything okay?
###309 - Yes, I'm fine.
###310 Um, I was heaving a problem with a client.
###313 - You sure?
###314 - Yeah, I'm good.
###315 Thank you for asking.
###318 - Ooh, I got to get this.
###319 - Okay.
###320 Kevin.
###321 - Yes.
###323 - Did Lindsey help you with your homework?
###324 - Uh, she...
###326 - Yes. - Yes.
###327 She... mm-Hmm.
###328 We did...
###329 - We did geography and his vocabulary,
###331 and we did the make-up questions on a quiz he failed.
###334 - What quiz did you fail?
###335 - It was a hard quiz, mom.
###337 And, plus, I didn't really fail fail.
###338 I just missed a lot of the answers,
###340 and we corrected them, so I'm getting a "b."
###343 - A "b" as in, boy, you better not bring home another "f?"
###346 - Yep, that's the one. That's the one.
###348 - Okay.
###349 Yeah.
###350 Love you guys.
###351 - Bye, mommy.
###352 - Hey. - Hey.
###353 - Hi.
###354 Bye.
###355 Bye.
###357 So you know that cute guy at the coffee shop?
###360 - The one who always gives you the next size up?
###363 - Right. - Mm-Hmm.
###364 - He asked me out.
###365 - And what did you say?
###366 - I said I'd think about it.
###367 - Okay, instead of saying you'd think about it,
###370 why didn't you just tell him no?
###372 - Because by my calculations,
###374 at five visits a week, say, over 48 weeks,
###376 at 90Â¢ per up size times two,
###379 that's about 450 bucks a year.
###382 And I spend that little extra money to help me look like this
###385 so I can get free coffee.
###387 - Why don't you just spend it on coffee?
###389 - And not look like this?
###393 - Wow.
###394 - Thank you.
###396 - What are you talking about?
###397 - Uh, never mind, honey.
###398 What is it?
###399 - Well, you might be interested in knowing
###402 that your boy, Mr. Nick Kingston-persons,
###405 has secured an interview with the one,
###408 the only Ms. Laila Ali.
###411 - What?
###417 - Honey, honey, come on.
###418 Okay, stop, stop.
###420 Babe, babe.
###421 That's fantastic,
###422 but please don't do that in front of her.
###424 The lady might have a flashback and knock you out.
###427 Wow.
###428 Laila Ali.
###429 Nick.
###430 - No. - Suzanne.
###432 - Nick. - What?
###433 - Can you please get her to sign my boxing gloves?
###436 Please.
###437 - I'll see what I can do.
###438 - Thank you.
###440 - Honey, how did this come about?
###441 Laila Ali, that's a big deal.
###443 - Yeah, it's a big deal.
###445 She has a speaking engagement in Hawaii next week,
###447 and they needed somebody this week.
###448 - Wow.
###449 Must be nice to work in Hawaii.
###452 - Yeah, I wish I was going to Hawaii.
###454 They got me going to pebble beach next week.
###456 - Oh, really? What for?
###457 - Local guy in the pro-am.
###459 I'm working on a profile.
###460 - All right.
###461 Well, honey, we got to go.
###463 I love you. I'll see you later.
###464 - Okay, baby. - Bye.
###466 - Uh, Gigi?
###467 - What?
###468 - When can I get those gloves?
###469 - Oh, so I'll see you out there, okay?
###471 - Okay. - Um, tonight.
###473 And can you also get her holding my gloves
###476 and take a picture.
###477 - Gigi, enough about the gloves.
###479 Listen.
###480 What I am about to tell you, you cannot say anything.
###484 And by anything, I mean nothing.
###487 You cannot discuss what I'm about to tell you
###489 with anyone but me.
###491 - Nick, Suzanne is my best friend.
###493 I... I can't have no secrets with her husband.
###496 - Gigi. - What?
###497 - I'm taking Suzanne on a honeymoon.
###502 - When?
###503 - That's the thing.
###504 It has to be next week.
###505 - But you just said you're going to pebble beach next week.
###507 - I'm not. I lied.
###508 - Ooh.
###510 - Listen, I need her to think that I'm traveling
###511 so she doesn't make plans for me to be here
###513 that I can't get out of.
###516 - Nick, why are you telling me this?
###518 You know I can't hold no secrets.
###520 - I need you to clear her calendar.
###521 - It's gonna be tough.
###523 - What? She's got a lot of appointments?
###524 - No, I wrote everything in pen.
###527 - Gigi. - What?
###528 Okay, okay, I'll see what I can do.
###532 I got to go.
###533 - Gigi. - What?
###535 - Not a word.
###536 Or I will kill you.
###540 You... wow, you're serious.
###552 - You know, ma, I don't ask for much.
###555 It's only five nights.
###557 - And six days.
###558 And you think you gonna sucker me
###560 into staying here with those kids
###561 by making me a sandwich?
###563 - That is not just a sandwich.
###565 That is hand-cut,
###567 honey-roasted, free range Turkey,
###570 with cave-aged gouda cheese,
###572 resting on seven grain organic wheat bread.
###576 No, man, that is not just a sandwich.
###579 That is an experience.
###583 Come on, ma.
###584 Look at this place.
###589 - Ooh, that is nice.
###592 Is this the part where you hit me up
###593 for the money to help with the deposit?
###595 - No, ma, I just need your help with the kids.
###598 - Can I just give you the money?
###600 I'll tell you what I'll do.
###601 I will stay here with those kids
###603 if you promise me that while you're there,
###605 you'll take Suzanne on one of those boat rides
###607 that I hear white men take their wives on.
###609 - What kind is that?
###610 - The kind where the wives don't come back.
###613 Get it?
###614 Ooh, I tickle me.
###621 Almost there.
###622 Uh. Whoa, replay!
###624 Ha-ha!
###626 - Kevin, come on.
###627 I really want to hook up with my friends.
###629 I'm supposed to be helping you with this essay,
###631 not doing it for you.
###632 - I'm only gonna be a few more minutes.
###633 What's wrong with it anyway?
###635 - What's wrong with it?
###636 That's the stupidest essay I've ever read.
###638 Do you even know anything about Barack Obama?
###640 - If you hate it so much, you write it.
###642 - Why would I do that?
###643 - You're the one with friends waiting.
###644 I got all night.
###645 - Fine. - Awesome.
###647 So if you could get that to me about 7:00,
###648 8:00 at the latest.
###649 - Oh, it'll be here.
###655 - You should have it in a little while.
###657 Okay, you're welcome.
###658 B'bye.
###660 Okay.
###663 Maui emerald shores?
###667 Six days, five nights, Kingston-persons?
###676 Hello?
###677 Um, yes, I'm calling to confirm a reservation.
###681 Sure.
###682 Nick Kingston-persons.
###686 Thank you.
###687 Yes, no, I just wanted to make sure
###689 that it was a king non-smoking.
###691 Upgraded to a sweet?
###693 For two?
###695 Oh, and it's part of the swim with the dolphins package?
###699 Right, next Tuesday through Saturday.
###702 Thank you.
###703 Yeah, you have a good day too.
###716 Hello?
###717 - Hey, can I please speak with Nick?
###719 - Who's this?
###720 - Uh, this is Skinner from the office.
###722 I just wanted to let Nick now
###723 that we're gonna take Palmer off pebble beach
###725 and do it next week with him instead.
###727 So if he can check his schedule and get back to me,
###730 I'd greatly appreciate it.
###732 - So Nick wasn't on the pebble beach assignment?
###735 - Well, he wasn't, but he is now.
###737 - And it's next week?
###738 - Right.
###739 - And who are you calling for?
###741 - Nick Kingston-persons.
###743 - D you are?
###744 - This is Skinner.
###745 - From the office? - Yes.
###747 - Who's office? - What?
###749 - No, uh, I'm sorry.
###750 Never mind. B'bye. Thank you.
###755 - Suzanne, that is ridiculous.
###757 Nick is not having an affair.
###759 - Gigi, I'm not stupid.
###761 He said he was going to pebble beach next week,
###764 and instead I find a reservation to Maui.
###767 - Maui?
###768 - Maui. - Maui?
###769 - Yes. - Hawaii?
###771 - Yes. - That is amazing.
###773 - Right?
###774 And then I find out that it's a king suite.
###777 - King suite?
###778 - King suite.
###780 - Mm.
###781 - I mean, isn't that crazy?
###783 - Crazy.
###784 - And then I find out
###785 that he was never even going
###786 on this alleged pebble beach assignment.
###788 - You know what?
###790 I refuse to believe your husband is cheating on you.
###793 - Well, you don't have to believe it.
###794 - Well, you know what?
###795 Maybe someone stole his credit card
###798 and put the room under his name.
###801 Yeah, I mean, identity theft is real.
###804 - So what?
###806 So they broke into our house,
###807 used our computer,
###809 booked the reservation,
###810 and had the confirmation email sent to his address
###812 so he would never find out about it?
###813 - I didn't say they were good at it.
###815 - Gigi. - What?
###817 - Why are you defending him?
###818 Do you know something I don't?
###820 - Do... no.
###822 I mean, do I know... how can you ask me do I know something?
###824 Have I ever known anything?
###826 - Well, if you knew something, you would tell me, right?
###829 I mean, you have to tell me.
###831 - You are insulting me right now.
###833 Because, girl, you know if I knew something
###835 that I knew you needed to know,
###836 and you didn't know and I knew you needed to know that,
###838 girl, you know me.
###839 When have I ever not told you something.
###841 - Never.
###842 - Right.
###844 So don't be questioning our friendship
###845 over some obvious misunderstanding,
###848 which I'm sure will be explained to your satisfaction,
###850 sooner rather than later.
###853 - I'm not waiting for later.
###855 - Where are you going?
###856 - To find out if I need to check Nick into a rehab.
###859 - Go do what you got to do.
###861 Just don't mention my name.
###868 - Is there a particular fighter
###869 you've had a problem with in the ring?
###871 - You know what, I believe
###872 that if you have a problem with a fighter in the ring,
###874 then you had a problem with your skills
###876 before she even showed up.
###877 So what I would do is analyze my own weaknesses,
###879 figure out how someone was gonna try to beat me,
###881 and then I wouldn't let it happen.
###882 - Wait. Not one problem with anybody?
###885 Like, Jackie Frazier?
###887 - Oh, you know what?
###888 Don't even start bringing up
###889 them damn fraziers, okay,
###890 or I'm gonna have a problem with you.
###892 Next thing you'll be asking me
###893 if Rita foreman has a cookbook,
###894 you know, when her daddy got all them grills.
###896 - Okay, okay, backing off, backing off.
###898 - Back on up, now.
###900 - You are the Beyonce of boxing.
###902 You got your own clothing line,
###904 cosmetics, fragrances, line of skillets,
###907 jeans, workout tapes.
###909 So what's next for laila Ali, sleep?
###912 - No, ma'am, you cannot come in here.
###913 We're shooting.
###914 - Oh, no, they ain't shooting.
###916 I'm the one that's about to be shooting, though, for real.
###918 - Babe, what are you doing here?
###919 - Don't "babe" me.
###920 Sit down.
###922 Is this her?
###923 - Her who?
###924 Baby, this is laila Ali.
###925 - Oh, I know who she is.
###926 Stand up.
###930 Oh, no.
###932 Come on, man.
###933 Are you kidding me?
###935 So what, you gonna take your little boxing baby mama
###937 to Hawaii and try and hide the baby from me?
###939 - Whoa, whoa, wait, you know what?
###940 Listen here, little chick.
###941 I don't know who you are or what this is about,
###944 but if you call me out my name one more time,
###945 I'm gonna smack you.
###947 Okay, I don't care if you are little.
###948 - And I don't care if you are big.
###949 I may only hit you once, but it's gonna be hard.
###952 - Suzanne, have you lost your mind?
###953 She is pregnant.
###954 - Oh, whatever.
###955 - You know what? Let her try.
###957 Me and this baby will knock her little butt out.
###960 - Laila, laila, please.
###961 Please, let me handle this.
###962 Don't hurt her.
###963 - Are you seriously gonna stand there
###965 and protect her over me?
###967 Hell naw.
###968 You know what? Sit down.
###969 And don't you move.
###971 Let me tell you something.
###973 You need to explain yourself.
###975 - Lady, if you don't take your finger out my neck...
###981 - Okay, explain yourself.
###983 Why is my man going to Hawaii
###985 with y'all, laila, Ali?
###986 - What? - Huh?
###988 - You know what? You're crazy.
###989 I'm gonna go ahead and go,
###990 because if I stay, I'm gonna have
###991 to bop your wife on the top of the head.
###993 - Laila, laila, no, no.
###995 Laila, no, please.
###997 - Go ahead. Go ahead.
###998 - Suzanne! Whoa, whoa, this is crazy!
###1000 - You know what? Don't try to play dumb, Nick, okay?
###1003 I saw your trip to Maui.
###1004 You said you were going to pebble beach.
###1007 - I lied about that.
###1009 - Okay, so finally we get to the truth.
###1013 You know what, Nick?
###1015 I've had my heart broken before,
###1017 so now it's your turn.
###1018 So why don't you tell me?
###1019 Are you going to Hawaii with laila or somebody else?
###1024 - Somebody else.
###1028 - Fine.
###1030 You know what? Who is it? What's her name?
###1033 - Suzanne.
###1036 - Just tell me, okay?
###1039 - Suzanne.
###1040 - Suzanne?
###1042 Her name is Suzanne, Nick?
###1044 What?
###1045 - It's you.
###1046 Look, look, I'm taking you to Hawaii.
###1047 Damn, I was trying to be clever.
###1049 - What do you mean, you're taking me?
###1050 Now is not the time to be clever, Nick.
###1053 I'm about to shoot you.
###1054 - Whoa, whoa, baby, baby.
###1055 Whoa, hey, okay, look.
###1057 It was our honeymoon.
###1059 I'm taking you on a honeymoon.
###1061 It was supposed to be a surprise.
###1062 Give me the gun.
###1064 - Hawaii?
###1065 Are you serious?
###1066 - Yes.
###1068 How did you find out?
###1069 Did Gigi say something?
###1070 - No.
###1071 Honey, it was on your computer.
###1073 I saw it at the house.
###1074 Gigi knew about this?
###1075 - I needed her to clear your schedule, baby.
###1079 - Honey, get up, get up.
###1081 Mm.
###1082 Oh, oh, I love you.
###1083 I'm so sorry.
###1085 Oh, my God.
###1086 Laila.
###1087 Ms. Ali.
###1089 I am so sorry.
###1090 I'm sorry. Please forgive me.
###1095 Well, I guess it's okay.
###1097 Can't get mad at a woman for coming after her man.
###1100 But you know you did almost get knocked out.
###1104 You still have that gun?
###1105 - Mm-mm. - It's right here.
###1106 Don't worry about it.
###1107 - Oh, okay.
###1109 If she makes one move, you hit her as hard as you can, okay?
###1113 - All right, um, let's pick it up.
###1116 Where were we?
###1117 - Pick it up?
###1118 I never stopped rolling.
###1119 - What?
###1120 - No, you got to... You got to erase that.
###1128 - What?
###1129 - Yes, I'm telling you, her fist is, like, this big.
###1132 - I love her.
###1133 - Huge. - Oh.
###1135 - Gigi.
###1136 One set of Laila Ali autographed boxing gloves.
###1142 Thank you.
###1144 Where's my picture?
###1146 - Let me tell you something.
###1147 Suzanne almost got knocked out, I almost got shot.
###1150 You better be glad you got those.
###1152 - Thank you. - Yeah.
###1153 Got your gloves. Now knock yourself out.
###1156 - Bye.
###1157 - Bye. - B'bye.
###1160 - Whoo, looks like we have a nice trip to look forward to.
###1164 - Oh, yes, honey.
###1166 And lord knows I could use it.
###1167 - Well, if you had paid attention
###1169 and proofread that thing like I told you,
###1170 we wouldn't be in this.
###1171 - Yeah, but you shouldn't...
