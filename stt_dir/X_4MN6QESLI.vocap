###1 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Like me, some of you may love hitting the gym, for others it might
###4 seem like a chore. But what happens when police use pushups as a punishment? We`re going to
###9 work out the details today on CNN STUDENT NEWS.
###26 President Obama, members of Congress, corporate executives, small business owners -- all of
###30 them involved in meetings this week, they are all talking about the same thing -- the
###34 fiscal cliff. Yesterday, we said what could happen if the government goes over that cliff,
###39 so to speak, on January 1st. Taxes would go up for all Americans, government spending
###45 would be automatically cut for different government services. What we didn`t mention, is that
###50 the government set this thing up when they couldn`t work out a deal to lower the U.S.
###55 debt, lawmakers and the president came up with this idea for this automatic spending
###60 cuts. Everyone involved agrees that the debt needs to be reduced. They don`t agree on how
###65 to do that. So for now, the clock is ticking.
###68 The person you`re looking at here is Maria Santos Gorrostieta. From 2008 to 2011 she
###74 was the mayor of a town in Mexico that was plagued by violence from the country`s drug
###79 war. The mayor herself was targeted by attacks twice. She survived both times. This month,
###85 Gorrostieta was kidnapped. Her body was found last week. The drug war and the wave of violence
###91 that`s part of it have dominated Mexican politics for years. It`s something that the outgoing
###97 president, Felipe Calderon has faced, and it`s something that Mexico`s next president,
###101 Enrique Pena Nieto will face as well. Brian Todd examines their approaches.
###105 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###106 BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Deploying the Mexican army and Marines as never before,
###110 Calderon fought the cartels head on, took out several kingpins. But during his six-year
###115 term, the streets of Juarez, Tijuana, Sinaloa flowed with blood. At least 50,000 Mexicans
###122 were killed. Many of them innocent civilians. That`s far more than the American death tolls
###127 in Iraq and Afghanistan combined. Homicide rates in those areas have recently plateaued.
###133 And a Mexican official tells us, civilians there are telling them they do feel safer
###137 now. Tourism is bouncing back. Analysts say President-elect Pena Nieto will continue to
###143 confront the cartels, but in a more nuanced way.
###146 ERIC OLSON, WOODROW WILSON CENTER: With the United States, he is going to ask for more
###149 intelligence sharing from the United States. There`s been intelligence sharing, it`s been
###154 in a little more limited way. They would like to see that expanded. So that Mexican authorities,
###161 police, army, Marines have more information and can go after the bad guys with that intelligence.
###167 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###168 AZUZ: Today`s first "Shoutout" goes out to Mr. Oswald`s class at Craver Middle School
###173 in Colorado City, Colorado.
###175 Who was the first American to travel into space? You know what to do. Was it Neil Armstrong,
###181 John Glenn, Alan Shepard or Buzz Aldrin? You`ve got three seconds, go.
###190 On May 5, 1961, Alan Shepard entered the history books as the first American in space. That`s
###199 your answer and that`s your "Shoutout."
###202 Shepard`s historic flight lasted around 15 minutes. Captain Scott Kelly is going to be
###207 in space a little longer than that. 365 days longer. Started in the spring of 2015, U.S.
###215 astronaut is set to spend an entire year in space. Kelly and a Russian cosmonaut will
###221 be up in the international space station, orbiting the earth, while the planet does
###225 one full orbit around the sun. Officials at NASA are hoping that this mission will help
###230 them learn more about how extended time in space effects the human body. And that might
###235 help plan for future missions to an asteroid or even another planet. Kelly has spent a
###240 total of 180 days in space, but that`s been spaced out over four previous trips. Going
###246 for a year straight, that would set a new U.S. record.
###250 Scientists create new technologies and give them artificial intelligence. The machines
###254 take on a life of their own, rise up against their creators and destroy the human race.
###259 It sounds like a plot of a sci- fi movie, and it has been. But some researchers wonder,
###263 if it could happen in real life. Scientists at a university in Great Britain say it`s
###269 reasonable to predict that machines could have independent intelligence, sometime in
###273 the next couple hundred years. They suggest it would be dangerous to dismiss concerns
###279 of a potential robot uprising. So they are going to spend time studying it. The potential
###284 dangers from biotechnology, artificial intelligence and nanotechnology.
###289 It`s time for a "Shoutout" extra credit.
###293 Shrimp, crickets and scorpions are all members of which of these groups? Here we go: are
###299 they all arthropods, vertebrates, cephalopods or crustaceans. Put another three seconds
###304 on that clock and go!
###308 Shrimp, crickets and scorpions are all arthropods, the largest phylum of animals. That`s your
###317 answer and that`s your Shoutout" extra credit.
###323 So, you might be like me and that you are more used to seeing shrimp on a plate than
###328 in the wild. It turns out, any of those arthropods could be served as food, though, the idea
###333 of crunching on a cricket or scarfing down some scorpions might make your skin crawl.
###338 These bugs aren`t just edible, though. Some experts are saying they are healthy. Dr. Sanjay
###342 Gupta dishes out the details.
###343 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###344 DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Silkworm larvae stir-fried with soy, sugar and just
###350 a dash of white pepper.
###351 The silkworms have -- have texture of like popcorn, and they have a creamy center. Bon
###359 appetite!
###361 Typhoon restaurant in Santa Monica is one of a handful of restaurants right here in
###365 America that serves patrons bugs on purpose.
###369 Chilly-pepper seasoned crickets. Even scorpions on shrimp toast.
###375 KEVIN OH, TYPHOON RESTAURANT: Scorpions still have the stinger in them, but they are dried,
###379 so the poison is neutralized.
###381 GUPTA: Scorpions are just one of 1,700 bugs that are safe for people to consume.
###386 It`s still a novelty here in the States, but insects are part of a daily diet in most of
###392 the world. Earlier this year the United Nations held their global conference on the benefits
###397 of eating insects, even suggesting it might be a good solution to world hunger.
###401 OH: I don`t know why the United States doesn`t eat insects, when they are actually very healthy
###405 for you.
###405 GUPTA: And he is right: insects are high in protein, low in fat and cholesterol. Take
###411 a cricket, for example. A six-ounce serving of these crunchy bugs have 60 percent less
###418 saturated fat as the same amount of ground beef.
###421 OH: And now the ants.
###422 GUPTA: These string potatoes aren`t complete without adding some dried ants.
###426 OH: They taste a little sour, tangy, and they have a hint of black pepper to them.
###433 GUPTA: They also have 14 grams of protein per serving. With the growing population and
###439 rising costs of food, the rest of the world just might be on to something.
###446 Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN, Santa Monica, California.
###449 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###450 AZUZ: If you can stomach it, eating some bugs might be healthy, but you know not to go dig
###455 in around your yard for dinner. Bugs in the wild, they could be poisonous, they could
###459 be coated with chemicals. So you need to make sure that you only eat bugs -- if you eat
###464 bugs -- that come from certified sellers or restaurants.
###468 We didn`t expect to see people doing pushups in here. But on the side of the road after
###473 getting in trouble with police? That`s what got an investigation going in Rhode Island.
###478 Police say, a group of people between ages 15 and 18 vandalized the mailbox. And the
###483 video is blurry, but you can barely see them here doing pushups. That`s what officers made
###488 them do instead of arresting them or filing a report about the incident. But now the police
###493 are being investigated.
###493 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###494 MAYOR CHARLES LOMBARDI, NORTH PROVIDENCE, RI: We are not going to tolerate juveniles
###499 coming into town and knocking out mailboxes. And at the same time, we are not going to
###506 allow our police officers to take the law in their own hands.
###512 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###513 AZUZ: One of the accused vandal`s mother said this: "the cop did wrong, but I`m glad he
###517 tried to teach my son a lesson. Personally, I don`t think he should be suspended."
###522 Our affiliate spoke to some residents of the area, many of whom seem to support the pushup
###526 punishment. Do you think police went too far or that justice was served? Talk to us on
###531 our blog at cnnstudentnews.com, but please, use only your first name.
###536 And finally, a gym in Orlando, Florida specializes in helping certain family members keep fit.
###542 The four-legged ones. Fat cats and portly poodles might seem cute and cuddly, but doctors
###547 say the extra weight could be taking years off the pets` lives. Part of the problem is
###551 how much they eat and one solution for that: hit the gym. This one`s got a pool, treadmills,
###558 Pilates equipment.
###558 This dog`s owner says he`s lost six pounds in four months. It takes some effort to shed
###563 those extra pounds, but if it makes your pets healthier, it could be well worth the weight.
###567 Yeah, just a couple of puns today. We really had to scale it back a bit, but we know many
###571 of you find them uplifting, so we`ll work out some more and have them ready tomorrow
###575 when CNN STUDENT NEWS returns.
