###23 BERT JONES: I compete usually every weekend.
###27 Every Friday nights, I'll be competing at Cave Creek, out
###31 by Phoenix, Arizona at a place called Buffalo Chip.
###35 And I pretty much go over there because they pay pretty
###38 good money.
###39 Then Saturdays and Sundays, I would just go anywhere where
###42 they would have bull ridings.
###44 Tonight.
###44 I don't know about tonight.
###46 There will probably be quite a bit of people.
###48 Quite a bit of spectators.
###50 So it should be a pretty good turnout tonight.
###53 I was entered in a bull ride in Encienta, and the bull
###57 stepped right on the back of my head.
###59 And he knocked me out.
###61 And then he hit his horn right on the back of my head.
###64 And then he stepped on me.
###66 And I was flown out to Flagstaff, Arizona.
###70 And I didn't come through until two days later.
###74 And I had four concussions.
###78 Broken ankles.
###79 Dislocated elbow.
###82 Stitches in my mouth.
###84 Inside my mouth, outside.
###85 Right above my eyes.
###87 Broken fingers, broken wrists.
###89 
###96 EARL TSOSIE, JR.: At the beginning of June, I went to
###97 this rodeo in Vanderwagen.
###99 Vanderwagen, New Mexico.
###101 I got on this white horse.
###101 I'd been on him before at that same rodeo.
###104 I'd got on the horse, maybe about a good four seconds.
###109 He reared up.
###110 And then he fell on me backwards.
###112 I got hung up too.
###114 On that horse.
###115 I fell off the wrong way and I got hung up for maybe a good
###121 six minutes.
###122 That was a very long time.
###125 It happened real fast, you know?
###127 I remember spurring.
###128 Making a [INAUDIBLE] right.
###129 And all of a sudden the horse flipped back.
###132 Hurt my back pretty bad.
###134 [NATIVE AMERICAN MUSIC]
###191 RODEO ANNOUNCER: Let's have a nice round of applause.
###193 [INAUDIBLE]
###194 Let's hear it.
###195 
###200 EARL TSOSIE, JR.: That looks scary.
###201 No.
###203 That was after a rodeo.
###204 We ate dinner, and we ate out.
###208 This guy wanted to get on some rides.
###209 I was like no.
###210 I ate a lot.
###211 This ain't for me.
###212 Those rides are like, way up there.
###213 And spinning.
###216 He forced me on, so I had to get on.
###218 For now, like us for sure, we're in the rodeo business.
###223 There's no turning back once you start.
###224 So, you could get hurt.
###226 You could buck off here and there.
###228 But you just put that behind, don't look back,
###231 and just get on again.
###232 RODEO ANNOUNCER: [INAUDIBLE]
###233 
###238 BERT JONES: But with the bulls they'll--
###240 once they go in they'll--
###242 they'll be ready.
###243 Some of them will stand in the [INAUDIBLE] and then they'll
###245 start kind of really getting antsy.
###247 Wanting to buck.
###250 It's pretty fun to watch.
###251 It's just like probably seeing you kids play
###253 basketball, do something.
###255 I mean you want them to do good here.
###257 [GATE SLAMS OPEN]
###258 [BELLS CLANGING]
###260 RODEO ANNOUNCER: [INAUDIBLE]
###261 
###266 [BUZZER]
###271 BERT JONES: You tie them around your boots so your
###273 boots won't fall off.
###275 I mean you don't want to ride a bull perfectly.
###279 So I'll be bull riding tonight and hopefully
###282 we'll get a good drawing.
###283 Turn out big scores tonight.
###286 The way I do it is like I pray to the bull.
###290 I'm just asking him for the strength to ride him.
###294 Just to be safe while I'm on him.
###296 And I'm not there to hurt him or anything.
###299 And that's just pretty much what I say to him.
###301 And they'll listen.
###304 Their ears on one side will kind of wave.
###307 But they know.
###308 They understand.
###309 RODEO ANNOUNCER: [INAUDIBLE]
###310 
###319 Got my arm behind me.
###320 And it just shifted my whole hips.
###321 And then threw me off.
###323 So it's kind of upsetting but you've just got to roll your
###328 stuff back up and get to the next bull ride.
###332 [BELLS CLANGING]
###341 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###354 EARL TSOSIE, JR.: When you get there, you get in your own
###355 mood, you know?
###357 Something changes.
###359 Me and the animal.
###360 They live in the [INAUDIBLE].
###362 He knows what he's going to do--
###364 what he's going to do there when they bring it.
###366 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###383 RODEO ANNOUNCER: He's out of there.
###384 Looks like he's out of bounds.
###387 Oh yeah ladies and gentlemen.
###389 [INAUDIBLE]
###390 right there.
###391 He's showing you how it's done.
###393 [BUZZER]
###395 EARL TSOSIE, JR.: We go out there and show
###397 our stuff out there.
###397 And show those guys what we've got too.
###401 Ride against the best in the world.
###403 That's one of my main goals.
###405 It's kind of like our job.
###406 And we're trying to stay out of trouble.
###408 And we just keep riding, driving, riding.
###410 Going to the next rodeo.
###412 [INAUDIBLE] finals was picking up, so we've got to really
###414 keep our focus.
###415 And keep our "A" game together.
###418 And start thinking about the rodeo more from now on.
###421 And go to the finals.
###423 And hopefully get that world title.
###427 Hopefully it all turns out our way.
###428 The way we want it to be, so.
