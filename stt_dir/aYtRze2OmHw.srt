1
0:0:0,959 --> 0:0:4,83
jess's apartments missing something
rather curious about the banks recently


2
0:0:4,83 --> 0:0:8,209
of the head of their criminal division
is labor or any drizzly


3
0:0:8,209 --> 0:0:11,799
told frontline and a documentary


4
0:0:11,799 --> 0:0:13,82
but in any given case i think


5
0:0:13,82 --> 0:0:17,119
uh... on in prosecutors around the
country being responsible


6
0:0:17,119 --> 0:0:21,8
should speak to regulators she speak
experts 'cause if i bring a case against


7
0:0:21,8 --> 0:0:22,87
institution a


8
0:0:22,87 --> 0:0:25,13
the result of bring that case to
something


9
0:0:25,13 --> 0:0:29,5
there's some huge economic effectively
creates a ripple effect so the subway


10
0:0:29,5 --> 0:0:32,68
counterparties and other financial
institutions or other companies that had


11
0:0:32,68 --> 0:0:35,4
nothing to do with this are affected
badly


12
0:0:35,4 --> 0:0:40,5
so factor we need to know and understand


13
0:0:40,5 --> 0:0:43,46
so in other words they are too big a
jail


14
0:0:43,46 --> 0:0:48,45
uh... if i an expert comes it tim burger
and tells me i hate look this will cause


15
0:0:48,45 --> 0:0:51,17
a ripple effect and it will hurt the
global economy


16
0:0:51,17 --> 0:0:53,31
if you do the job


17
0:0:53,31 --> 0:0:54,66
and you're s


18
0:0:54,66 --> 0:0:56,44
bankers who are


19
0:0:56,44 --> 0:0:59,179
criminal fraud or criminal money laundry


20
0:0:59,179 --> 0:1:2,4
it as a test be seated


21
0:1:2,4 --> 0:1:6,279
uh... that could hurt the economy so
back down do not do your job


22
0:1:6,279 --> 0:1:7,53
waitressing so


23
0:1:7,53 --> 0:1:11,369
hair colour with in for the senate
judiciary committee yesterday may ask


24
0:1:11,369 --> 0:1:15,32
you about that the same eric holder who
earlier was saying i can drop a drone on


25
0:1:15,32 --> 0:1:20,59
you for your regular citizen padhai
trials truck stinkin trials i don't need


26
0:1:20,59 --> 0:1:21,409
i'm right


27
0:1:21,409 --> 0:1:22,67
and is executed


28
0:1:22,67 --> 0:1:25,84
but what does the bankers this is what
he said is that


29
0:1:25,84 --> 0:1:27,35
i'm concerned that


30
0:1:27,35 --> 0:1:32,3
the size of some of these institutions
becomes so large that it does become


31
0:1:32,3 --> 0:1:39,4
difficult for us to uh... to prosecute
them when we are hit with


32
0:1:39,4 --> 0:1:43,64
indications that give you prosecute if
you do bring a criminal charge uh... it


33
0:1:43,64 --> 0:1:47,909
will have a negative impact when the
national economy press given the world


34
0:1:47,909 --> 0:1:49,4
economy


35
0:1:49,4 --> 0:1:53,21
and i think that is a function of the
fact that some of these institutions


36
0:1:53,21 --> 0:1:54,24
have become


37
0:1:54,24 --> 0:1:56,19
too large


38
0:1:56,19 --> 0:1:57,45
and mainstream


39
0:1:57,45 --> 0:2:0,2
in actual senate testimony isis


40
0:2:0,2 --> 0:2:3,61
well you have tended to large but what
can we do so it'll hurt the global


41
0:2:3,61 --> 0:2:6,9
economy so we're not going to do our job


42
0:2:6,9 --> 0:2:9,699
get out of jail free card here you go
use exactly like


43
0:2:9,699 --> 0:2:13,899
not only do we not prosecute for pass
crimes weren't telling you right here in


44
0:2:13,899 --> 0:2:14,569
public


45
0:2:14,569 --> 0:2:17,429
we're not gonna prosecutor enterprise


46
0:2:17,429 --> 0:2:19,589
how bad i toss


47
0:2:19,589 --> 0:2:23,349
now do they feel same way about regular
citizens was interesting 'cause


48
0:2:23,349 --> 0:2:26,68
their goal was also asked about their
sports where they pursue the case


49
0:2:26,68 --> 0:2:28,129
against them


50
0:2:28,129 --> 0:2:30,149
he'd even violate the law


51
0:2:30,149 --> 0:2:34,549
they claim you buy a lady determine
service contract in a private contract


52
0:2:34,549 --> 0:2:37,69
he had that he downloaded documents too
fast


53
0:2:37,69 --> 0:2:39,929
you know he didn't even make them public


54
0:2:39,929 --> 0:2:44,87
spoke booked his name crime was
downloading documents too fast


55
0:2:44,87 --> 0:2:46,3
they threatened in japan


56
0:2:46,3 --> 0:2:48,739
thirty five years in jail


57
0:2:48,739 --> 0:2:51,759
do you think that was appropriate to
turn into older


58
0:2:51,759 --> 0:2:53,5
uh... doesn't try to use


59
0:2:53,5 --> 0:2:56,819
odd that the government would uh...


60
0:2:56,819 --> 0:2:59,299
indict someone for crimes


61
0:2:59,299 --> 0:3:2,879
that put carry penalties of up to thirty
five years in prison


62
0:3:2,879 --> 0:3:6,349
and million dollar fines and then offer
my three or four months


63
0:3:6,349 --> 0:3:7,669
prison sentence


64
0:3:7,669 --> 0:3:11,129
well i think that's a good good use of
prosecutorial discretion to look at the


65
0:3:11,129 --> 0:3:12,609
the conduct


66
0:3:12,609 --> 0:3:16,299
regardless of what the statutory maximum
sworn to fashion a sentence that was


67
0:3:16,299 --> 0:3:20,579
consistent with but what the nature of
the the conduct was i think that what


68
0:3:20,579 --> 0:3:25,839
those prosecutors did in offering three
four zero two six was consistent with


69
0:3:25,839 --> 0:3:29,689
with that conduct three don't consider
this a case of prosecutorial re-try


70
0:3:29,689 --> 0:3:30,53
misconduct


71
0:3:30,53 --> 0:3:34,5
no i don't look at what necessarily was
charged as much as what was offered in


72
0:3:34,5 --> 0:3:35,92
terms of um...


73
0:3:35,92 --> 0:3:38,849
how the case might have been resolved


74
0:3:38,849 --> 0:3:41,309
isn't that amazing


75
0:3:41,309 --> 0:3:44,289
no it was good prosecutorial discretion


76
0:3:44,289 --> 0:3:47,489
to charge a guy who didn't actually
break the law


77
0:3:47,489 --> 0:3:50,9
with a possible thirty five-year
sentence


78
0:3:50,9 --> 0:3:53,849
and at the same time on the same day he
just said


79
0:3:53,849 --> 0:3:55,16
on wall prosecute


80
0:3:55,16 --> 0:3:57,629
any bankers


81
0:3:57,629 --> 0:4:4,229
remember hsbc did money-laundering for
the mexican drug cartels needed money


82
0:4:4,229 --> 0:4:7,439
laundering for al-qaeda


83
0:4:7,439 --> 0:4:11,169
you got a lot of rock as well as your
time bakery or free to go that is


84
0:4:11,169 --> 0:4:15,629
brilliant prosecutorial discretion but
if you are every citizen


85
0:4:15,629 --> 0:4:19,81
a new download documents all too fast
and we call you how active s


86
0:4:19,81 --> 0:4:22,28
all we need put you in jail for thirty
five years


87
0:4:22,28 --> 0:4:25,71
ways as well we probably would have put
him in for laughs well are you not


88
0:4:25,71 --> 0:4:30,88
merciful you see that right there is a
perfect microcosm of what's wrong with


89
0:4:30,88 --> 0:4:34,3
our justice system because we don't have
one


90
0:4:34,3 --> 0:4:36,629
is to polina consistent


91
0:4:36,629 --> 0:4:39,139
no justice for us


92
0:4:39,139 --> 0:4:42,69
and the bankers get what ever they want


93
0:4:42,69 --> 0:4:47,289
anarchic turned gel our top law
enforcement officer goes out and tells


94
0:4:47,289 --> 0:6:47,289
the senators of this country i will not
prosecute the buyers
