like slicing a steak.


22
0:1:15,96 --> 0:1:16,42
NIALL ROWNTREE: Exactly.


23
0:1:16,42 --> 0:1:17,552
The first thing we're
gonna do is we're


24
0:1:17,552 --> 0:1:18,88
gonna bleed the animal.


25
0:1:18,88 --> 0:1:20,4
So we do that with [INAUDIBLE]
top of the breastbone with the


26

my friend, this is the


30
0:1:32,473 --> 0:1:33,363
bit you came for.


31
0:1:33,363 --> 0:1:36,865
You put that on your head
[INAUDIBLE], and you can shake


32

your hand on the top of it

and give it a push down
like that [INAUDIBLE].


42
0:2:1,82 --> 0:2:3,2
And what you'll do here is
you'll do a quick check on the


43
0:2:3,2 --> 0:2:4,5
health of the animal.


44
0:2:4,5 --> 0:2:6,8
What you're looking at that
there, the stomach of the


45
0:2:6,8 --> 0:2:8,9
animal is quite healthy.

So that's your first indication
that this animal,

OK for the human food chain.

would she give birth?

birth probably around about

when the calf was born.
