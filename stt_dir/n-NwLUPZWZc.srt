(Dripping Water)


4
0:1:48,0 --> 0:1:56,0
Guard: Oh it's you. You're not supposed to be here.


5

(Bird song)


9
0:2:33,0 --> 0:2:45,0
Connor: (Groans)


10
0:2:45,0 --> 0:2:50,0
Connor: James get up. We're late.


11
0:2:50,0 --> 0:3:12,0
Connor: (Sighs)


12
0:3:12,0 --> 0:3:26,0
James: Why'd we have to get so drunk on a Sunday night?


13
0:3:26,0 --> 0:3:29,0
Connor: Do you remember that part last night where Amy got on the table and started to...


14
0:3:29,0 --> 0:3:38,0
James: (Interrupts) Connor, that's my sister! I don't need to be reminded.


15
0:3:38,0 --> 0:3:46,0
James: Where's all the food?


16
0:3:46,0 --> 0:3:49,0
James: (Sighs)


17
0:3:49,0 --> 0:3:50,5
(Car horn honks)


18
0:3:50,5 --> 0:4:3,0
Connor: Come on, let's go.


19
0:4:3,0 --> 0:4:5,5
Amy: Come on guys, we're gonna be late!


20
0:4:5,5 --> 0:4:16,8
Connor: Sure you're ok to drive after your stunt last night Amy?


21
0:4:16,8 --> 0:4:18,7
James: Oh... Hi Matt.


22
0:4:18,7 --> 0:4:25,0
Matt: Alright.


23
0:4:25,0 --> 0:4:26,0
Connor: Not getting the bus today?


24
0:4:26,0 --> 0:4:31,5
Matt: Nope


25
0:4:31,5 --> 0:4:35,5
Amy: I... saw him as I was driving past the shops and picked him up.


26
0:4:35,5 --> 0:4:38,0
James: Oh, ok.


27
0:4:38,0 --> 0:4:39,5
Connor: So what's the rush anyway?


28
0:4:39,5 --> 0:7:6,0
Amy: Some kind of emergency meeting.


29
0:7:6,0 --> 0:7:8,3
James: What do you think this emergency meeting's about?


30
0:7:8,3 --> 0:7:15,0
Amy: I don't know, but... it can't be that important.


31
0:7:15,0 --> 0:7:25,0
Matt: Alright, go on ahead guys. I'm going to go powder my nose.


32
0:7:25,0 --> 0:7:32,0
Director General (DG): No! Dr. Niven, LHC is most important experiment of our time. I will not let unfounded theories...


33
0:7:32,0 --> 0:7:35,4
Dr. Niven: (Interrupts) Unfounded?! Director, my results show that...


34
0:7:35,4 --> 0:7:43,0
DG: (Interrupts) Inconclusive! Your results are inconclusive at best. No, you'll have plenty of time for measurements when you're down in the tunnel tonight.


35
0:7:43,0 --> 0:7:47,0
Dr. Niven: Director, we have to stop the LHC until we assess the danger.


36
0:7:47,0 --> 0:7:53,0
DG: No Dr. Niven. Once we have fixed this problem the LHC will run again as usual.


37
0:7:53,0 --> 0:8:9,3
DG: Finding the Higgs is the highest priority.


38
0:8:9,3 --> 0:8:38,0
Amy: Why is Dr. Niven going into the tunnels?


39
0:8:38,0 --> 0:8:40,1
James: Why do you think the Director General's here?


40
0:8:40,1 --> 0:8:50,0
Matt: Maybe they made a black hole...


41
0:8:50,0 --> 0:8:53,4
Lisa: (Very quiet) Sorry.


42
0:8:53,4 --> 0:8:53,4
Lisa: Hey.


43
0:8:53,4 --> 0:8:55,4
Amy: Hey.


44
0:8:55,4 --> 0:8:57,5
Lisa: So, did you recover from last night?


45
0:8:57,5 --> 0:8:57,5
Amy: ...Yeah. You too?


46
0:8:57,5 --> 0:9:0,0
Lisa: Mmmhmm.


47
0:9:0,0 --> 0:9:3,0
Amy: Wait, aren't you supposed to be on your way to Barcelona by now?


48
0:9:3,0 --> 0:9:5,0
Lisa: I might have missed my flight...


49
0:9:5,0 --> 0:9:13,0
Amy: Oh no!


50
0:9:13,0 --> 0:9:19,0
DG: Good morning! I'm Professor Vacinski, Director General of CERN.


51
0:9:19,0 --> 0:9:23,3
DG: This meeting has been called because last night there was an emergency beam dump.


52
0:9:23,3 --> 0:9:26,0
(Crowd whispers furtively)


53
0:9:26,0 --> 0:9:32,0
DG: Here we see a monopole magnet in LHC Sector 7G.


54
0:9:32,0 --> 0:9:41,0
DG: Beam sensors have detected that an unknown event caused this magnet to quench and triggered an uncontrolled shut down.


55
0:9:41,0 --> 0:9:45,3
DG: If this happens again the results could be catastrophic.


56
0:9:45,3 --> 0:9:56,0
DG: Due to the special circumstances, Dr. Niven is taking a team into the LHC tunnel to investigate the cause, and see what damage there is.


57
0:9:56,0 --> 0:9:59,5
The LHC will be in shut down until at least the end of the week.


58
0:9:59,5 --> 0:10:7,5
DG: Since Dr. Niven will not be available we will need 4 volunteers to be on shift in the control room.


59
0:10:7,5 --> 0:10:8,3
Connor: We'll do it.


60
0:10:8,3 --> 0:10:9,4
Amy: (Quietly) What are you doing?!


61
0:10:9,4 --> 0:10:13,0
DG: Ok, you four.


62
0:10:13,0 --> 0:10:17,3
Lisa: Oh, I'm going to be at a conference in Barcelona.


63
0:10:17,3 --> 0:10:22,0
DG: Uh, very well. You... you then.


64
0:10:22,0 --> 0:10:26,0
Matt: Uh, I have an analysis note due this week, so I'm not going to have time to do this...


65
0:10:26,0 --> 0:10:30,3
DG: (Interrupting) The collider will be shut down. You can work in the control room.


66
0:10:30,3 --> 0:10:37,1
DG: Report to the control room at 9pm. That is all everybody.


67
0:10:37,1 --> 0:10:59,3
Lisa: Sucks to be you guys!


68
0:10:59,3 --> 0:11:0,3
Connor: Here you go.


69
0:11:0,3 --> 0:11:2,5
Amy: Thanks.


70
0:11:2,5 --> 0:11:5,0
Connor: They don't look like proton decay matrices.


71
0:11:5,0 --> 0:11:12,2
Amy: (Sighs) No.


72
0:11:12,2 --> 0:11:16,5
Amy: Dr. Niven's got me working on this Higgs bio-entanglement simulation.


73
0:11:16,5 --> 0:11:20,0
Amy: Some company gave a lot of money to CERN and I get stuck working on it.


74
0:11:20,0 --> 0:11:23,3
Amy: I've got so much work to do.


75
0:11:23,3 --> 0:11:26,3
Connor: Listen, are you ok after last night?


76
0:11:26,3 --> 0:11:27,55
Amy: Why?


77
0:11:27,55 --> 0:11:29,5
Connor: You and Matt...


78
0:11:29,5 --> 0:11:37,0
Amy:  I don't know what you're talking about. Anyway, you jealous?


79
0:11:37,0 --> 0:11:41,0
Amy: Oh... sorry.


80
0:11:41,0 --> 0:12:8,4
Amy: Listen, I'd better go. I've got a lot of work to do.


81
0:12:8,4 --> 0:12:14,0
Amy: (Sighs) I'm so tired. I can't even think about work right now.


82
0:12:14,0 --> 0:12:21,5
Amy: I hope he doesn't expect me to remember anything.


83
0:12:21,5 --> 0:12:24,0
Dr. Niven: Ah Lisa. Did you finish your talk?


84
0:12:24,0 --> 0:12:25,3
Lisa: Yeah! Just in time.


85
0:12:25,3 --> 0:12:27,3
Dr. Niven: I had every confidence in you.


86
0:12:27,3 --> 0:12:30,3
Amy: Did you get a chance to look at my simulation?


87
0:12:30,3 --> 0:12:34,0
Dr. Niven: Ah yes! The problem with the supersymmetric parameter lattice...


88
0:12:34,0 --> 0:12:39,3
Dr. Niven: I think I found a way to express it differently.


89
0:12:39,3 --> 0:12:50,0
Dr. Niven: I didn't implement it in my analysis code yet but you might like to try it.


90
0:12:50,0 --> 0:12:53,0
Amy: It looks more complex though. I don't know if it'll work on my laptop.


91
0:12:53,0 --> 0:12:55,0
Dr. Niven: Well, we'll deal with that later if we need to.


92
0:12:55,0 --> 0:12:57,0
Amy: Ok, thanks.


93
0:12:57,0 --> 0:13:5,0
Dr. Niven: Anyway, I have to prepare my team for going into the tunnels and look over Lisa's talk, so I'll talk to you later.


94
0:13:5,0 --> 0:13:8,3
Dr. Niven: And Lisa... don't miss the plane again.


95
0:13:8,3 --> 0:13:32,0
Lisa: I won't.


96
0:13:32,0 --> 0:13:35,5
James: Hey guys, wait!


97
0:13:35,5 --> 0:13:37,4
James: I'm waiting for someone.


98
0:13:37,4 --> 0:13:38,4
Amy: Who?


99
0:13:38,4 --> 0:13:41,0
James: Just... someone.


100
0:13:41,0 --> 0:13:46,3
Matt: Ok, well, we're going to be late so...


101
0:13:46,3 --> 0:13:58,0
Kate: Hi!


102
0:13:58,0 --> 0:14:1,0
James: Everyone, this is my girlfriend Kate.


103
0:14:1,0 --> 0:14:3,3
James: Kate, this is Matt and Connor...


104
0:14:3,3 --> 0:14:4,0
Connor: Hi.


105
0:14:4,0 --> 0:14:5,3
James: And my sister Amy.


106
0:14:5,3 --> 0:14:5,3
Kate: Hi.


107
0:14:5,3 --> 0:14:7,4
Amy: Nice to finally meet you.


108
0:14:7,4 --> 0:14:9,5
James: Finally...? I didn't tell you...


109
0:14:9,5 --> 0:14:13,0
Amy: Mum let it slip. I was waiting for you to tell me.


110
0:14:13,0 --> 0:14:16,0
Kate: It's nice to finally meet you as well.


111
0:14:16,0 --> 0:14:17,3
Amy: Are you coming with us?


112
0:14:17,3 --> 0:14:18,0
Kate: I think so.


113
0:14:18,0 --> 0:14:18,3
James: Yeah.


114
0:14:18,3 --> 0:14:19,3
Amy: Ok.


115
0:14:19,3 --> 0:14:22,23
James: Shall we go?


116
0:14:22,23 --> 0:14:26,0
Connor: So... why have you thrown your evening away to go on shift?


117
0:14:26,0 --> 0:14:30,0
Kate: James was going to come meet me for dinner but he told me you guys had to...


118
0:14:30,0 --> 0:14:31,3
Connor: Oh... sorry.


119
0:14:31,3 --> 0:14:33,0
Kate: It's ok, don't worry.


120
0:14:33,0 --> 0:14:44,0
Matt: And how did James manage to convince you that vending machine food is going to be an acceptable substitute?


121
0:14:44,0 --> 0:14:47,0
Amy: Shift can sometimes be boring, are you going to be ok?


122
0:14:47,0 --> 0:14:47,4
James: I told her.


123
0:14:47,4 --> 0:15:2,0
Kate: I insisted.


124
0:15:2,0 --> 0:15:11,0
James: She's with me.


125
0:15:11,0 --> 0:15:13,0
Kate: So are you guys physicists like James then?


126
0:15:13,0 --> 0:15:16,3
Connor: Yeah but he works on the accelerator. The rest of us analyse the data.


127
0:15:16,3 --> 0:15:20,0
Matt: Yeah, he's an engineer, and we're real physicists.


128
0:15:20,0 --> 0:15:29,3
Amy: (Sighs)


129
0:15:29,3 --> 0:15:31,0
Amy: So what do you do?


130
0:15:31,0 --> 0:15:39,0
Kate: I'm a trainee nurse.


131
0:15:39,0 --> 0:15:49,5
James: I hope you're not claustrophobic - it's a long way down.


132
0:15:49,5 --> 0:16:16,0
Kate: (Coughs)


133
0:16:16,0 --> 0:16:18,0
Matt: Guys, I've thought of a joke.


134
0:16:18,0 --> 0:16:20,0
Connor: Ugh - another one?


135
0:16:20,0 --> 0:16:26,0
Matt: So a chimpanzee and a sloth go down...


136
0:16:26,0 --> 0:16:29,0
Matt: And then the chimpanzee is like "uh... starfish! Starfish!"


137
0:16:29,0 --> 0:16:45,0
Everyone: (Laughs)


138
0:16:45,0 --> 0:16:47,3
James: Do you want to watch "A Clockwork Orange"? I borrowed it from Amy.


139
0:16:47,3 --> 0:16:48,5
Kate: Yep, sure.


140
0:16:48,5 --> 0:16:51,0
Matt: That's a pretty deep film for a lowly engineer like yourself.


141
0:16:51,0 --> 0:16:56,3
James: (Laughs)


142
0:16:56,3 --> 0:16:58,5
Kate: You shouldn't let him talk to you like that.


143
0:16:58,5 --> 0:17:30,3
James: He's only messing around.


144
0:17:30,3 --> 0:17:33,2
Matt: (Crowd noise)


145
0:17:33,2 --> 0:17:38,0
James: So the accelerator boosts the beam of protons to almost the speed of light.


146
0:17:38,0 --> 0:17:42,5
James: And then we collide them... here.


147
0:17:42,5 --> 0:17:54,3
James: And then we detect what's made in the collision.


148
0:17:54,3 --> 0:17:57,0
Amy: (Sighs loudly)


149
0:17:57,0 --> 0:17:58,3
James: What's up?


150
0:17:58,3 --> 0:18:1,3
Amy: I thought I'd got it working!


151
0:18:1,3 --> 0:18:3,0
James: Got... what working?


152
0:18:3,0 --> 0:18:4,0
Connor (off screen): Her Higgs simulation.


153
0:18:4,0 --> 0:18:6,3
Kate: Her... what simulation?


154
0:18:6,3 --> 0:18:11,3
Amy: My Higgs radiation simulation.


155
0:18:11,3 --> 0:18:14,3
Matt: The "God" particle.


156
0:18:14,3 --> 0:18:17,3
Amy: It's a particle that we're trying to make in the collider.


157
0:18:17,3 --> 0:18:24,0
Amy: I'm supposed to be investigating how it acts on living tissue, but my programme just crashes every single time that it starts to look bad.


158
0:18:24,0 --> 0:18:26,3
Connor: So what, you think Higgs radiation is dangerous?


159
0:18:26,3 --> 0:18:29,3
Amy: I don't know. I'd know if I could get it to finish!


160
0:18:29,3 --> 0:18:31,3
Connor: They wouldn't run the LHC if they thought it was a danger.


161
0:18:31,3 --> 0:18:34,0
Connor: Must be a glitch or something.


162
0:18:34,0 --> 0:18:36,3
Connor: Have you tried on the central computer system?


163
0:18:36,3 --> 0:18:39,3
James: Except... she doesn't have access to the mainframe.


164
0:18:39,3 --> 0:18:41,0
Kate: Are you not allowed to use it?


165
0:18:41,0 --> 0:18:45,0
Connor: Well... not exactly.


166
0:18:45,0 --> 0:18:58,0
(Typing on keyboard)


167
0:18:58,0 --> 0:18:58,0
Connor: There we go.


168
0:18:58,0 --> 0:19:15,0
James: Nice!


169
0:19:15,0 --> 0:19:16,3
(Alarm sounds)


170
0:19:16,3 --> 0:19:17,0
Matt: Nice one Amy!


171
0:19:17,0 --> 0:19:22,3
Amy: It wasn't me!


172
0:19:22,3 --> 0:19:25,0
James: It's not you... the LHC is ramping.


173
0:19:25,0 --> 0:19:27,0
Matt: "Ramping" ramping?


174
0:19:27,0 --> 0:19:28,0
Connor: The beams are firing!


175
0:19:28,0 --> 0:19:34,5
Amy: The team's still down there! Shut it off!


176
0:19:34,5 --> 0:19:38,5
(James pushes switch)


177
0:19:38,5 --> 0:19:41,0
James: What the fuck?!


178
0:19:41,0 --> 0:19:44,0
Amy: The phones are down!


179
0:19:44,0 --> 0:19:46,0
Kate: What... what's going on?


180
0:19:46,0 --> 0:19:49,3
James: The LHC is turned on. The radiation levels will be killing everyone down there.


181
0:19:49,3 --> 0:19:51,0
Kate: People are dying?!


182
0:19:51,0 --> 0:19:52,0
Matt: No one is dying!


183
0:19:52,0 --> 0:19:54,0
Amy: Shut up Matt!


184
0:19:54,0 --> 0:19:55,3
Amy: James, what can we do?


185
0:19:55,3 --> 0:19:58,0
James: I don't know, the overrides aren't working.


186
0:19:58,0 --> 0:19:59,5
Kate: I haven't got any signal!


187
0:19:59,5 --> 0:20:2,0
Matt: We're a hundred metres underground, what do you expect!


188
0:20:2,0 --> 0:20:6,0
(Console alarm sounds)


189
0:20:6,0 --> 0:20:10,5
James: The radiation levels are spiking. The shielding's not in place when the maintenance tunnels are open.


190
0:20:10,5 --> 0:20:11,5
Matt: Well why the fuck not?!


191
0:20:11,5 --> 0:20:14,5
James: This shouldn't be able to happen.


192
0:20:14,5 --> 0:20:16,0
Connor: ...Shit!


193
0:20:16,0 --> 0:20:27,0
Connor: We've got less than two minutes and we're fried. We've got to get out!


194
0:20:27,0 --> 0:20:28,5
Kate: What about the people in the tunnels?


195
0:20:28,5 --> 0:20:33,0
Matt: What about us!


196
0:20:33,0 --> 0:20:34,0
James: Fuck!


197
0:20:34,0 --> 0:20:35,0
James: It's locked down!


198
0:20:35,0 --> 0:20:41,0
Connor: James, calm down and think. How do we get out?


199
0:20:41,0 --> 0:20:43,0
James: We go into the service tunnels.


200
0:20:43,0 --> 0:20:47,0
Matt: The tunnels?! Are you mental?!


201
0:20:47,0 --> 0:20:51,0
James: The LHC master power's down there. It's shielded, we can shut it off.


202
0:20:51,0 --> 0:20:55,3
Matt: This is insane...


203
0:20:55,3 --> 0:21:1,3
Connor: Right, we'll go down and shut it off. Then we'll work out what to do there.


204
0:21:1,3 --> 0:21:3,0
Matt: No, but we can't...


205
0:21:3,0 --> 0:22:1,0
Amy (Interrupts): Come on!


206
0:22:1,0 --> 0:22:5,0
Kate: Push something!


207
0:22:5,0 --> 0:22:8,5
(Buttons being pushed)


208
0:22:8,5 --> 0:22:18,5
(Machines stop)


209
0:22:18,5 --> 0:22:25,0
(Group breathes heavily)


210
0:22:25,0 --> 0:22:38,5
(Backup power starts)


211
0:22:38,5 --> 0:22:42,0
Matt: So that's it?! The worlds largest machine has an on/off switch?


212
0:22:42,0 --> 0:22:44,0
Kate: What is your problem?!


213
0:22:44,0 --> 0:22:49,5
James: Look, this is just a relay. There's six of them. If one of them trips the others go off automatically.


214
0:22:49,5 --> 0:22:51,5
Amy: I hope somebody noticed that.


215
0:22:51,5 --> 0:22:56,0
Connor: There's nobody around to notice it. No one will be in until tomorrow.


216
0:22:56,0 --> 0:22:58,5
Connor: We need to find an elevator to get back to the surface.


217
0:22:58,5 --> 0:23:0,5
Matt: Yeah, if James knows where they are...


218
0:23:0,5 --> 0:23:4,5
James: Look, if we follow the tunnels we'll get out.


219
0:23:4,5 --> 0:23:11,0
Kate: But... what about the people down there? They could still be alive couldn't they?


220
0:23:11,0 --> 0:23:14,5
Connor: Even if they are, there's nothing we can do for them.


221
0:23:14,5 --> 0:23:18,7
Connor: The best we can do is get out and try and get help.


222
0:23:18,7 --> 0:23:20,7
Kate: But if the radiation did that to them... then...


223
0:23:20,7 --> 0:23:22,7
James: No - we're safe now the machine's off.


224
0:23:22,7 --> 0:23:27,5
James: It's just the ring itself that's radioactive. We're safe here.


225
0:23:27,5 --> 0:23:29,7
Amy: Oh my god, all those people...


226
0:23:29,7 --> 0:23:31,5
Amy: How could this happen?


227
0:23:31,5 --> 0:23:35,5
James: It couldn't have happened. You can't turn the machine on when there are people down there.


228
0:23:35,5 --> 0:23:38,0
James: There are interlock systems everywhere.


229
0:23:38,0 --> 0:23:40,5
Matt: Well somebody fucked up, and it wasn't me!


230
0:23:40,5 --> 0:23:43,7
Connor: Yeah, and it wasn't us! This couldn't happen from the control room.


231
0:23:43,7 --> 0:23:50,5
Connor: No one's got access to do that except... except maybe Dr. Niven... but he was down here.


232
0:23:50,5 --> 0:24:46,0
Connor: The sooner we get out of here the sooner we can sort it out.


233
0:24:46,0 --> 0:24:48,5
Kate: I... I don't like it down here.


234
0:24:48,5 --> 0:24:51,5
James: It's not too far.


235
0:24:51,5 --> 0:24:54,5
(Distant scream)


236
0:24:54,5 --> 0:25:10,0
Amy: What the hell was that?!


237
0:25:10,0 --> 0:25:13,0
Kate: Probably a steam valve or something... right?


238
0:25:13,0 --> 0:25:15,7
James: Probably.


239
0:25:15,7 --> 0:25:17,0
Kate: How much further is it?


240
0:25:17,0 --> 0:25:58,5
James: It's not far.


241
0:25:58,5 --> 0:26:0,5
Matt: ...Great.


242
0:26:0,5 --> 0:26:3,0
Matt: Just as i was starting to get freaked out.


243
0:26:3,0 --> 0:26:5,0
James: Look, I'm sorry. I thought that...


244
0:26:5,0 --> 0:26:6,5
Matt (Interrupting): Do you know where we're going or don't you?


245
0:26:6,5 --> 0:26:7,5
Amy: Matt...


246
0:26:7,5 --> 0:26:13,0
Matt: I can't be the only person that heard that scream. We're running around down here - Where the fuck are we going?


247
0:26:13,0 --> 0:26:16,5
Connor: Matt, calm down. If you know where to go, let's hear it. If not, shut up.


248
0:26:16,5 --> 0:26:20,0
Connor: James, do you know where we can go?


249
0:26:20,0 --> 0:26:45,7
James: I think if we go back and left and follow the ring around we can find our way from there...


250
0:26:45,7 --> 0:26:59,7
(Loud bang)


251
0:26:59,7 --> 0:27:1,0
(Growling)


252
0:27:1,0 --> 0:27:13,5
(Kate screams)


253
0:27:13,5 --> 0:27:33,2
James: Kate!


254
0:27:33,2 --> 0:27:38,0
(Bang against door)


255
0:27:38,0 --> 0:27:39,5
James: We've got to go and get her.


256
0:27:39,5 --> 0:27:49,0
Amy: You have to listen to me! James, listen! She's gone! You saw those people James, you saw what they did.


257
0:27:49,0 --> 0:28:0,0
Matt: Don't just fucking stand there, help!


258
0:28:0,0 --> 0:28:3,5
(Gas escaping)


259
0:28:3,5 --> 0:28:19,5
(Zombies scream in pain)


260
0:28:19,5 --> 0:28:21,0
Connor: What's that?!


261
0:28:21,0 --> 0:28:31,0
James: Freon coolant gas.


262
0:28:31,0 --> 0:28:34,0
Matt: What the fuck just happened?


263
0:28:34,0 --> 0:28:44,0
Amy: They looked like... the technician team that were down here. But why would they that to us?


264
0:28:44,0 --> 0:28:46,0
Amy: Did you see their faces?


265
0:28:46,0 --> 0:29:6,5
Connor: The radiation burns, yeah... They shouldn't even be alive.


266
0:29:6,5 --> 0:29:8,3
Matt: Where you going?


267
0:29:8,3 --> 0:30:13,0
Connor: The gas won't stop them forever.


268
0:30:13,0 --> 0:30:15,5
Connor: I found a way out. Come on, lets go.


269
0:30:15,5 --> 0:30:18,0
Matt: What if there's more of them?


270
0:30:18,0 --> 0:30:31,5
Connor: ...Here.


271
0:30:31,5 --> 0:31:29,7
Amy: Take this.


272
0:31:29,7 --> 0:31:33,0
Matt: One of these maniacs has a gun?!


273
0:31:33,0 --> 0:31:36,8
Connor: Think he's been dead a while.


274
0:31:36,8 --> 0:32:1,2
Amy: What's a security guard doing down here anyway?


275
0:32:1,2 --> 0:32:2,7
Connor: What is this?


276
0:32:2,7 --> 0:32:9,7
James: The interlock turns the LHC off if people are in the tunnels.


277
0:32:9,7 --> 0:32:14,5
Amy: It's been sabotaged. Someone did this on purpose.


278
0:32:14,5 --> 0:32:15,5
(Footsteps in the distance)


279
0:32:15,5 --> 0:32:17,0
James: That could be her!


280
0:32:17,0 --> 0:32:24,5
Connor: James, stop!


281
0:32:24,5 --> 0:32:30,7
Amy: James!


282
0:32:30,7 --> 0:32:37,35
Connor: James...


283
0:32:37,35 --> 0:32:38,7
(Monster screeches)


284
0:32:38,7 --> 0:32:46,7
(Screaming and shouting)


285
0:32:46,7 --> 0:32:58,3
(Crunching blow. Creature stops screaming.)


286
0:32:58,3 --> 0:33:0,0
Connor: Help!


287
0:33:0,0 --> 0:33:2,5
Amy: Give me the pipe!


288
0:33:2,5 --> 0:33:11,5
(Pipe clangs into place)


289
0:33:11,5 --> 0:33:11,5
(Monster continues struggling and growling)


290
0:33:11,5 --> 0:33:23,7
(Amy cries)


291
0:33:23,7 --> 0:33:25,5
James: Jesus Christ Matt...


292
0:33:25,5 --> 0:33:29,5
Matt: I... what else was I going to do?


293
0:33:29,5 --> 0:33:40,0
(Monster continues growling, gurgling and struggling)


294
0:33:40,0 --> 0:33:42,0
Amy: If they're all like that we're screwed!


295
0:33:42,0 --> 0:33:45,0
Amy: There were like, what, 30 people in this section?!


296
0:33:45,0 --> 0:33:48,5
Connor: We'll find a way out. James, which way?


297
0:33:48,5 --> 0:33:56,0
James: I thought there was an exit, back at the dead end. Next one's about a three hour walk away, it's at point 17. And that's if we don't get lost.


298
0:33:56,0 --> 0:33:58,0
Connor: Is there anywhere safe we can stop on the way?


299
0:33:58,0 --> 0:34:0,6
Amy: We need to let someone know we're down here!


300
0:34:0,6 --> 0:34:4,0
James: There's a mainframe computer room about half way round. We can send a message from there.


301
0:34:4,0 --> 0:34:9,0
Amy: Ok.


302
0:34:9,0 --> 0:34:42,32
(Electrical flickering)


303
0:34:42,32 --> 0:34:53,0
Connor: Which way now?


304
0:34:53,0 --> 0:34:55,4
James: We have to go that way.


305
0:34:55,4 --> 0:35:24,0
(Flickering lights)


306
0:35:24,0 --> 0:36:6,0
(Low machine noises, heartbeats and breathing)


307
0:36:6,0 --> 0:36:46,5
(Sound of tearing meat and chewing)


308
0:36:46,5 --> 0:36:48,5
(Monster screeches)


309
0:36:48,5 --> 0:36:57,0
(Sound of rapid heartbeat)


310
0:36:57,0 --> 0:37:9,0
(Monster screeches)


311
0:37:9,0 --> 0:37:21,7
(James screams)


312
0:37:21,7 --> 0:37:33,0
(James screams in anger)


313
0:37:33,0 --> 0:38:0,0
(Monster gurgles and scratches on floor)


314
0:38:0,0 --> 0:38:3,5
Matt: Jesus... What does it take to kill one of these things?!


315
0:38:3,5 --> 0:38:5,5
Amy: They're people Matt!


316
0:38:5,5 --> 0:38:8,0
Matt: No person could survive this!


317
0:38:8,0 --> 0:38:12,6
(Monster gurgles)


318
0:38:12,6 --> 0:38:14,3
Amy: Are you hurt?


319
0:38:14,3 --> 0:38:36,35
James: It's my arm.


320
0:38:36,35 --> 0:38:38,3
(Crunching bone and brain. Monster becomes silent)


321
0:38:38,3 --> 0:38:42,3
(Amy whimpers)


322
0:38:42,3 --> 0:38:47,8
(Pipe drops on floor)


323
0:38:47,8 --> 0:38:49,5
Connor: Are you alright?


324
0:38:49,5 --> 0:38:57,5
James: Yeah.


325
0:38:57,5 --> 0:38:59,5
Amy: You too?


326
0:38:59,5 --> 0:40:1,0
Connor: Ugh... yeah, I'll be fine.


327
0:40:1,0 --> 0:40:27,0
(Whine of computer fans)


328
0:40:27,0 --> 0:40:49,0
James: Can someone try and log in?


329
0:40:49,0 --> 0:40:58,0
(Typing)


330
0:40:58,0 --> 0:41:1,5
Matt: It's not accepting my user name. Connor, can you hack this?


331
0:41:1,5 --> 0:41:3,7
Amy: Not now Matt, give him a minute.


332
0:41:3,7 --> 0:41:5,8
Matt: Look, the quicker we get through to the server the sooner...


333
0:41:5,8 --> 0:41:20,0
Amy: Give it a rest Matt! How much use is he going to be to us if he's concussed?!


334
0:41:20,0 --> 0:41:20,7
(Connor groans in pain)


335
0:41:20,7 --> 0:41:23,0
Connor: Same place as last time.


336
0:41:23,0 --> 0:41:25,2
Amy: Same place as what?


337
0:41:25,2 --> 0:41:27,0
Connor: Cracked my skull climbing.


338
0:41:27,0 --> 0:41:29,9
Connor: They had to put a metal plate in my head.


339
0:41:29,9 --> 0:41:33,3
Amy: You never told me about that.


340
0:41:33,3 --> 0:41:36,4
Connor: It was when I went home for a few weeks.


341
0:41:36,4 --> 0:41:40,7
Connor: After Prague.


342
0:41:40,7 --> 0:41:42,6
Amy: Oh.


343
0:41:42,6 --> 0:41:49,0
Connor: I didn't mean it like that.


344
0:41:49,0 --> 0:41:51,0
Connor: Just give me a minute.


345
0:41:51,0 --> 0:42:0,0
Connor: And I'll see what I can do with the terminal.


346
0:42:0,0 --> 0:42:1,7
Connor: Is there anything up there?


347
0:42:1,7 --> 0:42:6,0
James: There's a door, it's secure. There's no one about. I think we're safe for now.


348
0:42:6,0 --> 0:42:19,0
Connor: All right. We'll stay here for a bit. I'll try and get through the firewall, see if I can get any help.


349
0:42:19,0 --> 0:42:21,0
Amy: How's your arm?


350
0:42:21,0 --> 0:42:25,5
James: Don't worry about me. The bleeding's stopped.


351
0:42:25,5 --> 0:42:37,8
Connor: Keep an eye on them stairs.


352
0:42:37,8 --> 0:42:41,8
James: We need to be looking for Kate.


353
0:42:41,8 --> 0:42:43,8
Amy: James...


354
0:42:43,8 --> 0:43:32,0
James: I know what you're trying to say. But you're wrong.


355
0:43:32,0 --> 0:43:39,0
(Typing)


356
0:43:39,0 --> 0:43:39,7
(Computer bleeps)


357
0:43:39,7 --> 0:43:42,0
Connor: Yes! Got in!


358
0:43:42,0 --> 0:43:47,0
Amy: Can you get through to anyone?


359
0:43:47,0 --> 0:43:50,0
Connor: ...no.


360
0:43:50,0 --> 0:44:4,0
Amy: Keep trying.


361
0:44:4,0 --> 0:44:10,0
(Computer bleeps)


362
0:44:10,0 --> 0:44:13,0
Connor: Amy, come here.


363
0:44:13,0 --> 0:44:15,0
James: Have you got through?


364
0:44:15,0 --> 0:44:17,0
Connor: No but...


365
0:44:17,0 --> 0:44:20,0
Connor: It says Amy's biosim just finished.


366
0:44:20,0 --> 0:44:21,3
James: Oh.


367
0:44:21,3 --> 0:44:23,0
James: So?


368
0:44:23,0 --> 0:44:37,0
Amy: So I was right about Higgs radiation...


369
0:44:37,0 --> 0:44:39,0
Matt: What?


370
0:44:39,0 --> 0:44:41,0
Amy: The Higgs killed them all.


371
0:44:41,0 --> 0:44:44,0
Matt: Killed who? They're not dead.


372
0:44:44,0 --> 0:44:46,0
Amy: Yes, they are.


373
0:44:46,0 --> 0:44:50,0
Amy: It's killed everything except the brain stem. There's nothing left of them.


374
0:44:50,0 --> 0:44:57,5
Amy: The radiation damage might stop it after a while... but for now they're just animals.


375
0:44:57,5 --> 0:45:3,0
Connor: You must have messed up or something... Missed a semi-colon! The... the Higgs wouldn't do that.


376
0:45:3,0 --> 0:45:6,0
Amy: It doesn't even look like my simulation.


377
0:45:6,0 --> 0:45:9,0
Amy: It looks more like Dr. Niven's...


378
0:45:9,0 --> 0:45:11,0
(Typing)


379
0:45:11,0 --> 0:45:16,0
James: So Dr. Niven knew and he still came down here?


380
0:45:16,0 --> 0:45:19,0
Amy: No, it says it's only just completed.


381
0:45:19,0 --> 0:45:22,0
Amy: He's been trying to run it for weeks and it always failed...


382
0:45:22,0 --> 0:45:32,0
Amy: ...until now.


383
0:45:32,0 --> 0:45:43,4
James: So they've been dead since the beam came on...


384
0:45:43,4 --> 0:45:50,4
Connor: James - we need to get out of here. I can't get help, but if I can get a map of the tunnels can you find a way out?


385
0:45:50,4 --> 0:45:51,6
James: I'll try.


386
0:45:51,6 --> 0:45:53,7
Matt: Find the way out?


387
0:45:53,7 --> 0:45:55,7
Matt: Why don't you ever know?


388
0:45:55,7 --> 0:45:57,7
James: I haven't been to this area before...


389
0:45:57,7 --> 0:46:0,0
Matt: Ok then, how long will it take this time?


390
0:46:0,0 --> 0:46:1,5
Connor: Matt! Enough!


391
0:46:1,5 --> 0:46:4,0
Matt: Fuck you Connor! Why are we even listening to you?!


392
0:46:4,0 --> 0:46:8,5
Matt: It's your fault we're on shift! It's your fault we're down here in the first fucking place!


393
0:46:8,5 --> 0:46:10,5
Amy: Leave him alone!


394
0:46:10,5 --> 0:46:12,5
Matt: Oh, concerned about his feelings now are we?


395
0:46:12,5 --> 0:46:14,5
Amy: ...don't.


396
0:46:14,5 --> 0:46:16,5
James: What?


397
0:46:16,5 --> 0:46:18,5
Matt: Everyone else has figured it out James.


398
0:46:18,5 --> 0:46:19,5
Matt: We fucked last night.


399
0:46:19,5 --> 0:46:21,0
Amy: Fuck you Matt, I was drunk!


400
0:46:21,0 --> 0:46:22,0
Matt: Not that drunk.


401
0:46:22,0 --> 0:46:23,8
James: You took advantage of my sister?!


402
0:46:23,8 --> 0:46:30,1
Matt: Advan... whatever. At least I get laid. Bet you didn't get that far with Kate.


403
0:46:30,1 --> 0:46:35,7
James: You... FUCK!


404
0:46:35,7 --> 0:46:37,0
James: I'm going to find Kate.


405
0:46:37,0 --> 0:46:38,0
Amy: James, she's dead.


406
0:46:38,0 --> 0:46:39,0
James: I have to go.


407
0:46:39,0 --> 0:46:45,0
Amy: No, stop it James! Come back! I need you! Come back!


408
0:46:45,0 --> 0:46:47,0
Amy: I have to go with him.


409
0:46:47,0 --> 0:46:48,0
Connor: You know she's dead right.


410
0:46:48,0 --> 0:46:50,0
Amy: I can't let him do this alone.


411
0:46:50,0 --> 0:46:51,0
Connor: Alright, I'll come...


412
0:46:51,0 --> 0:47:10,0
Amy (Interrupting): No, stay here, you have to find help!


413
0:47:10,0 --> 0:47:12,0
Amy: Do you know where you're going?


414
0:47:12,0 --> 0:47:15,5
James: I think there's a shortcut up here.


415
0:47:15,5 --> 0:47:18,7
Amy: I... I just...


416
0:47:18,7 --> 0:47:35,7
James: Thanks for coming.


417
0:47:35,7 --> 0:47:39,0
Connor: Look, Matt.


418
0:47:39,0 --> 0:47:41,3
Connor: Forget about that.


419
0:47:41,3 --> 0:47:43,0
Matt: Fine.


420
0:47:43,0 --> 0:47:45,9
Connor: Matt, we need to stick together to get out of here.


421
0:47:45,9 --> 0:47:45,9
Connor: Don't worry about...


422
0:47:45,9 --> 0:47:50,0
Matt (Interrupting): I said, fine!


423
0:47:50,0 --> 0:47:57,0
(Computer bleeps)


424
0:47:57,0 --> 0:47:58,5
Connor: What?!


425
0:47:58,5 --> 0:48:9,6
(Frantic typing)


426
0:48:9,6 --> 0:48:56,0
Connor: Shit!


427
0:48:56,0 --> 0:48:58,0
(Clanging metal)


428
0:48:58,0 --> 0:49:19,6
(Monster growls)


429
0:49:19,6 --> 0:49:34,0
(Growl from darkness)


430
0:49:34,0 --> 0:50:17,7
(Monster growls and scratches at cage door)


431

432
0:50:26,0 --> 0:50:32,5

433
0:50:32,5 --> 0:50:39,0
(Crunch of skull on metal)


434
0:50:39,0 --> 0:50:50,5
(Gunfire)


435
0:50:50,5 --> 0:52:6,5
(Monster growls, then stops)


436
0:52:6,5 --> 0:52:15,7
(Amy vomits)


437
0:52:15,7 --> 0:52:17,0
James: Are you ok? What's wrong?


438
0:52:17,0 --> 0:52:37,0
Amy (tearfully): James, please don't look. Please don't look.


439
0:52:37,0 --> 0:53:1,5
James: Let's go.


440
0:53:1,5 --> 0:53:3,5
Amy: Are you ok?


441
0:53:3,5 --> 0:53:9,5
James: I'm not feeling great.


442
0:53:9,5 --> 0:53:30,0
Amy: Look, here, I'll help you.


443
0:53:30,0 --> 0:53:32,0
Connor: What happened? Is he ok?


444
0:53:32,0 --> 0:53:35,7
Amy: I think his wound's infected.


445
0:53:35,7 --> 0:53:37,5
James: I'll be ok.


446
0:53:37,5 --> 0:53:39,0
James: Did you call for help?


447
0:53:39,0 --> 0:53:45,5
Connor: No. I couldn't through the firewall. But I got a map for this area.


448
0:53:45,5 --> 0:54:4,0
James: Alright.


449
0:54:4,0 --> 0:54:6,0
Connor: Where did you get that?


450
0:54:6,0 --> 0:54:8,0
Amy: We found a body in the tunnels.


451
0:54:8,0 --> 0:54:10,0
Amy: He must have shot that guard.


452
0:54:10,0 --> 0:54:13,9
Amy: But I saw him with the Director General earlier.


453
0:54:13,9 --> 0:54:15,7
Connor: Listen, there's something else.


454
0:54:15,7 --> 0:54:20,7
Connor: After you guys left all the sim data got deleted from the system.


455
0:54:20,7 --> 0:54:25,5
Connor: There's only one person with the authority to do that.


456
0:54:25,5 --> 0:54:31,5
Amy: If he's trying to stop people from finding out, that could by why we can't call for help.


457
0:54:31,5 --> 0:54:34,5
Connor: Are there any backups anywhere?


458
0:54:34,5 --> 0:54:38,0
Amy: Dr. Niven keeps a record of everything he does.


459
0:54:38,0 --> 0:54:41,6
Amy: It could be enough, if we can get to his office.


460
0:54:41,6 --> 0:54:50,0
Connor: If he knows we're down here...


461
0:54:50,0 --> 0:54:59,0
Amy: We'll get out.


462
0:54:59,0 --> 0:55:5,5
James: Hey guys. I think I found something.


463
0:55:5,5 --> 0:55:9,6
James: Ok, so we start here.


464
0:55:9,6 --> 0:55:11,5
James: And then we go over to here.


465
0:55:11,5 --> 0:55:14,5
James: The services lifts are down, so we'll have to take the stairs.


466
0:55:14,5 --> 0:55:16,5
James: There's a crawl space here.


467
0:55:16,5 --> 0:55:20,5
James: And then we come to here.


468
0:55:20,5 --> 0:55:23,0
James: And then we get out here.


469
0:55:23,0 --> 0:55:26,0
Amy: Is there any way we can get out nearer to Dr. Niven's office?


470
0:55:26,0 --> 0:55:27,0
James: Why?


471
0:55:27,0 --> 0:55:32,3
Amy: The simulation data logs got deleted. We have to go and find records.


472
0:55:32,3 --> 0:55:40,5
James: I don't think we can get through. There are safety doors in the way.


473
0:55:40,5 --> 0:55:47,5
Connor: Let me look at that.


474
0:55:47,5 --> 0:55:58,0
Connor: There we go!


475
0:55:58,0 --> 0:56:13,5
(Door bleeps and opens.)


476
0:56:13,5 --> 0:56:15,0
Amy: Are you feeling ok?


477
0:56:15,0 --> 0:56:29,5
James: I just... I just need to sleep.


478
0:56:29,5 --> 0:56:33,9
Amy: James?


479
0:56:33,9 --> 0:56:37,2
Amy: James!


480
0:56:37,2 --> 0:56:40,6
Amy: James?!


481
0:56:40,6 --> 0:56:54,5
(James breathes in deeply)


482
0:56:54,5 --> 0:56:56,5
Connor: Is he ok?


483
0:56:56,5 --> 0:56:59,5
Amy: I don't know. I don't know what's wrong with him.


484
0:56:59,5 --> 0:57:3,0
Amy: He's sleeping for now but... maybe we could let him rest for a bit?


485
0:57:3,0 --> 0:57:4,0
Connor: Yeah.


486
0:57:4,0 --> 0:57:5,0
Matt: No.


487
0:57:5,0 --> 0:57:7,3
Matt: I think we should get moving as soon as we can.


488
0:57:7,3 --> 0:57:9,3
Connor: If he doesn't rest we'll have to carry him.


489
0:57:9,3 --> 0:57:12,0
Matt: We can't wait here forever, and if he can't look after himself...


490
0:57:12,0 --> 0:57:16,5
Amy: Don't you dare, you selfish piece of shit! If you want to go just go on your own!


491
0:57:16,5 --> 0:57:19,5
Connor: No one's going anywhere! We'll rest for a bit, then we'll leave.


492
0:57:19,5 --> 0:57:19,5
(James growls and leaps)


493
0:57:19,5 --> 0:57:24,3
Amy: No! James, what are you doing?!


494
0:57:24,3 --> 0:57:26,3
Connor: Matt!


495
0:57:26,3 --> 0:57:28,0
Amy: Stop!


496
0:57:28,0 --> 0:57:33,0
Amy: James!

Amy: No!


501
0:57:48,0 --> 0:57:56,0
(Gun fire. James falls silent.)


502
0:57:56,0 --> 0:58:17,8
Connor: Come on, we need to go.


503

Amy: He's dead... he's gone.


507
0:58:41,5 --> 0:58:44,8
Connor: Amy, you need to... you need to...


508
0:58:44,8 --> 0:58:47,5
Connor: We have to...


509
0:58:47,5 --> 0:58:50,5
Amy: Connor... I never...


510
0:58:50,5 --> 0:59:1,5
Connor: It's ok. We can talk about that when we get out of here.


511
0:59:1,5 --> 0:59:3,5
Amy: I don't want to have to do this on my own.


512
0:59:3,5 --> 0:59:6,0
Connor: You won't have to.


513
0:59:6,0 --> 0:59:8,5
Connor: We know the way out now. We just need to...


514
0:59:8,5 --> 0:59:12,4

Connor: You know what'll happen.


518
0:59:25,0 --> 0:59:28,0
Amy: No, I don't! And neither do you!


519
0:59:28,0 --> 0:59:32,5
Connor: I'm bleeding out. When I die...


520
0:59:32,5 --> 0:59:34,7
Connor: I don't want to come back.


521
0:59:34,7 --> 0:59:38,5
Amy: No! I can't lose you. Not now!


522
0:59:38,5 --> 0:59:41,5
Connor: I'll end up killing you. You need to get out.


523
0:59:41,5 --> 0:59:46,0
Amy: No. Look, hold this - I'll go get a first aid kit. It'll be ok!


524
0:59:46,0 --> 0:59:48,0
Connor: Give me the gun if you can't do it!


525
0:59:48,0 --> 0:59:51,0
