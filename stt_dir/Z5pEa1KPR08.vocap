###5 THOMAS MORTON: We left Belgrade and headed south
###7 through Serbia, on the same highway as turbo
###8 folk grew up on.
###10 As we crossed the Ibar River into the mountains of Kosovo,
###12 the weather darkened, and the "Kosovo is Serbia" graffiti
###15 we'd been seeing since Belgrade became more frequent
###17 and less nicely scrawled.
###18 
###24 It's 1:30 in the morning.
###27 We're going to Mitrovica, a city in the North.
###29 It's half Serb, half Albanian, and there's a bunch of dudes
###32 on a bridge who keep the Albanians from crossing into
###38 the area with the Serbs.
###40 We're going to go hang out with these guys, hopefully not
###44 watch them beat up Albanians.
###45 
###54 The problems in Kosovo date back over 600 years of very,
###57 very, very confusing history.
###59 A long time ago, the entire region belonged to the Serbs,
###62 but they lost it to the Turks in 1389.
###65 And despite the fact that, since then, the territory has
###67 changed hands more times than fucking Poland, many Serbs
###70 still carry a grudge.
###73 Tension simmered during the Tito years before finally
###75 erupting in 1989, when Serbs rioted over discrimination by
###79 the growing Albanian majority.
###81 This is where Milosevic actually became a Serbian
###84 nationalist, and it was basically the flash point for
###87 all the wars that followed.
###88 
###91 We just got to the Kosovo border.
###93 There's barbed wire here.
###95 Are there men up there with guns?
###98 No?
###99 It looks like a fortress.
###102 OK.
###104 
###107 So we are now in Kosovo.
###109 
###112 During the '90s, the Kosovar Albanians accused the Serbian
###115 army of trying to ethnically cleanse them from the area.
###119 The Kosovo Liberation Army was formed by the Albanians,
###121 ostensibly to defend them from Serbian genocide, though many
###124 people noticed their tactics were eerily similar their
###126 enemy's, which is to say atrocious.
###129 Then Bill Clinton got a blow job and decided to bomb Serbia
###132 until they gave up Kosovo to the Albanians, which
###134 they kind of didn't.
###136 Anyhoo, the tidiest symbol for this ridiculous mess is a
###138 bridge in the town of Mitrovica.
###140 The north side is Serbian, the south side is Albanian, and
###143 every night, a group of hotheads stand on each side
###145 and beat the shit out of anybody who tries to cross.
###149 Even though the war officially ended in 1999, the bridge has
###152 continued to be the site of some
###153 extremely nasty showdowns.
###155 Most recently, in 2010, a dispute over some local
###158 elections turned into a rock party between the Serbian
###161 Bridgewatchers and their Albanian counterparts.
###163 That silver-haired guy chucking a stone in the middle
###165 of the bridge right there is the Serbian Bridgewatchers' de
###168 facto leader, Nebojsa Jovic.
###171 He's been watching the bridge for over a decade, and has
###173 been involved in a lot of particularly shady incidents
###175 between the Serbs and Albanians.
###177 NEBOJSA JOVIC: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###179 
###204 THOMAS MORTON: Nebojsa's basic point is that if his
###206 Bridgewatchers didn't stand guard every night, there'd be
###208 no one to protect the Serbs from being
###210 driven out of Mitrovica.
###212 NEBOJSA JOVIC: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###213 
###232 THOMAS MORTON: While Nebojsa claims that his men have
###233 called off their vigil, we couldn't help but notice a lot
###235 of tough-looking motorists making extremely aggressive
###238 U-turns right in front of the bridge all night long.
###242 We just got done having a little chat with our buddy,
###244 with the Bridgewatchers.
###246 I guess we're just going to hang out here and see what
###249 happens, see if people just circle all night or if they
###251 get out of their cars or whatever.
###253 I'm kind of hoping it's boring, because the
###255 alternative sounds terrifying.
###257 
###261 MALE SPEAKER: Three guys on my left, two guys sitting on the
###265 benches behind me, so there is so much activity.
###269 If you'd like to go to the bridge, you can freely do it.
###273 THOMAS MORTON: Oh, we can?
###274 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###284 THOMAS MORTON: That's a little foreboding.
###287 Yeah.
###288 Well, let's go to the bridge, then.
###289 
###293 Crossing the bridge in Mitrovica was actually sort of
###295 no big deal.
###295 It was just like crossing any bridge that has no lights and
###299 a permanent detachment of UN soldiers
###301 stationed in the middle.
###302 Still, there's something eerie about being the only people
###304 besides cops on a bridge where hundreds of other
###306 folks have bled out.
###308 It's kind of like sneaking into Antietam in the middle of
###310 the night, only if the Civil War had happened,
###312 like, five years ago.
###314 There's another person doing a U-turn very fast.
###320 MALE SPEAKER: They're coming to the bridge, making U-turn,
###322 going back.
###323 There, just the same as here.
###327 THOMAS MORTON: There's no reason for
###328 them to make a U-turn.
###330 Despite the fact that nothing kicked off while we were
###332 there, it was definitely spooky on the bridge.
###335 We also had no idea whether or not the Albanian side would be
###337 as hectic as Nebojsa had warned us.
###339 
###344 Hey, it's Thomas.
###345 I'm at the [INAUDIBLE]
###347 Cafe, which is a very nice, European-style place.
###349 A couple years ago, though, an Albanian boy walked across the
###354 bridge and threw a bomb in here.
###355 And that wasn't the first bomb that's gone off in here.
###358 This is the bridge.
###359 You see a heavy police presence there,
###360 but it's that's it.
###362 That tiny little strip is what divides Albanian Kosovo from
###367 Serbian Kosovo.
###368 And so one thing that's weird is we noticed a lot of cars
###372 pull over right before they cross the bridge.
###374 And the drivers hop out and pop off their license plates.
###378 And the deal is, if you're driving a car in the wrong
###379 neighborhood with the wrong plates, you're basically
###382 asking to get killed.
###384 And you'll see a number of cars just driving around with
###387 no plates at all, like it's no big thing.
###389 I mean, we've been getting, I feel like,
###392 one side of the story.
###395 So we're going to go over there and--
###398 basically into Albanian Kosovo and see what it's like.
###402 On the Albanian side of the bridge, we met a group of kids
###405 who didn't quite live up to the menacing hoard Nebojsa had
###408 led us to expect.
###409 
###417 THOMAS MORTON: This is the spot.
###418 
###421 The old main drag.
###423 Have you ever had any trouble with the Bridgewatchers?
###425 We keep hearing about them.
###426 
###435 THOMAS MORTON: I'm sorry.
###436 
###447 THOMAS MORTON: Right, they just look like normal folks.
###451 
###456 THOMAS MORTON: I didn't know you'd grown up in the North.
###457 
###463 THOMAS MORTON: A Serb friend?
###464 And you'll go with him?
###465 
###472 THOMAS MORTON: Right.
###473 
###494 THOMAS MORTON: It's like lawless.
###495 Right.
###496 
###507 THOMAS MORTON: Snitches get stitches.
###508 
###535 THOMAS MORTON: No, we walked right through.
###537 I was waiting for a frisk and the dogs and stuff.
###540 
###547 THOMAS MORTON: Our day on the Albanian side made it totally
###549 clear what the real problem is here.
###550 It isn't violence or genocide.
###552 It's demographics.
###554 The Serbian side is practically empty, and what
###556 people you do see all seem to be pretty fucking old or
###558 bussed-in skinheads.
###560 Then you cross the bridge, and it's all kids--
###562 not scary kids, either, just regular kids hanging out and
###565 otherwise minding their own, but a lot of them.
###568 And that's what the real threat is.
###570 Albanian Kosovo is growing, while
###571 Serbian Kosovo is shrinking.
###573 And all the beatings in the world ain't
###574 going to change that.
###576
