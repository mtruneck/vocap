2
0:0:0,19 --> 0:0:2,38
STEVE SPANGLER: So I know what
you're thinking, how could it


3
0:0:2,38 --> 0:0:5,32
be November, in Colorado, and
there's still leaves on the


4
0:0:5,32 --> 0:0:7,3
trees, and I'm dressed
like this?


5
0:0:7,3 --> 0:0:9,69
More importantly, what's up with
the potato and the straw?


6
0:0:9,69 --> 0:0:10,62
I'm going to tell you what.


7
0:0:10,62 --> 0:0:12,17
I'm going to take this straw,
and I'm going to jam it


8
0:0:12,17 --> 0:0:14,63
through this potato, and you're
going to like it, but


9
0:0:14,63 --> 0:0:16,2
not before you watch this.


10
0:0:16,2 --> 0:0:19,86
I'm Steve Spangler, and I'm all
about making science fun.


11
0:0:19,86 --> 0:0:22,49
For the last 20 years, I've
been teaching ways to turn


12
0:0:22,49 --> 0:0:25,5
ordinary science experiments
into unforgettable learning


13
0:0:25,5 --> 0:0:26,51
experiences.


14
0:0:26,51 --> 0:0:29,13
I have an amazing team who will
do whatever it takes to


15
0:0:29,13 --> 0:0:31,9
affect the way people
think about science.


16
0:0:31,9 --> 0:0:35,6
And to do that, I live by one
motto, make it big, do it


17
0:0:35,6 --> 0:0:37,363
right, give it class.


18
0:0:37,363 --> 0:0:42,68



19
0:0:42,68 --> 0:0:43,37
It's the first science


20
0:0:43,37 --> 0:0:44,47
experiment that I ever learned.


21
0:0:44,47 --> 0:0:46,14
It was actually in
kindergarten.


22
0:0:46,14 --> 0:0:48,26
I had a kindergarten teacher
who had a whole thing of


23
0:0:48,26 --> 0:0:50,37
potatoes sitting there, and
a whole thing of straws.


24
0:0:50,37 --> 0:0:52,77
And the challenge was, she said
boys and girls, I want


25
0:0:52,77 --> 0:0:55,6
you to take that-- because she
always said boys and girls--


26
0:0:55,6 --> 0:0:57,39
take this straw and jam
it through the potato.


27
0:0:57,39 --> 0:0:59,12
And do that a whole bunch of
times, and when you're done,


28
0:0:59,12 --> 0:0:59,6
bring it to me.


29
0:0:59,6 --> 0:1:0,33
It'll be a porcupine.


30
0:1:0,33 --> 0:1:2,4
We'll put eyes on it,
and that's your


31
0:1:2,4 --> 0:1:3,54
little take-home surprise.


32
0:1:3,54 --> 0:1:5,76
And she didn't even have to
finish those words, and


33
0:1:5,76 --> 0:1:9,45
there's 14 boys trying to jam
a straw through a potato.


34
0:1:9,45 --> 0:1:12,2
If you can't see, it doesn't
work so well.


35
0:1:12,2 --> 0:1:14,3
If you try to jam a straw
through the potato, it doesn't


36
0:1:14,3 --> 0:1:15,16
work because it crumbles.


37
0:1:15,16 --> 0:1:17,3
Unless, you use what's
in the straw.


38
0:1:17,3 --> 0:1:18,96
And what is inside the straw?


39
0:1:18,96 --> 0:1:21,43
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
it's called air.


40
0:1:21,43 --> 0:1:23,95
So if you put your thumb over
the end of the straw, you trap


41
0:1:23,95 --> 0:1:24,86
the air inside.


42
0:1:24,86 --> 0:1:27,5
And now, as you hold
onto it like this,


43
0:1:27,5 --> 0:1:28,36
you just jam through.


44
0:1:28,36 --> 0:1:30,65
And what I've learned
is that brown is the


45
0:1:30,65 --> 0:1:32,2
potato, and pink is me.


46
0:1:32,2 --> 0:1:35,86
So you have to practice where
you're going to jam, but it's


47
0:1:35,86 --> 0:1:36,32
pretty good.


48
0:1:36,32 --> 0:1:37,95
Here, watch this.


49
0:1:37,95 --> 0:1:40,1
Straw through the potato.


50
0:1:40,1 --> 0:1:43,48
See that air gives the straw
that rigid support, because


51
0:1:43,48 --> 0:1:44,33
air takes up space.


52
0:1:44,33 --> 0:1:44,82
It's perfect.


53
0:1:44,82 --> 0:1:46,3
And here's the greatest thing.


54
0:1:46,3 --> 0:1:48,81
Look at the little piece of
potato lodged right here.


55
0:1:48,81 --> 0:1:49,66
This is perfect.


56
0:1:49,66 --> 0:1:51,37
You don't throw the straw
away, you just jam


57
0:1:51,37 --> 0:1:52,14
through one more time.


58
0:1:52,14 --> 0:1:53,79
Watch.


59
0:1:53,79 --> 0:1:56,7
And this is exactly what
you're looking for.


60
0:1:56,7 --> 0:1:57,3
Look.


61
0:1:57,3 --> 0:1:58,98
Piece of potato lodged here.


62
0:1:58,98 --> 0:2:0,36
A piece of potato here.


63
0:2:0,36 --> 0:2:3,0
If you can get your buddy to
come over to the table and jam


64
0:2:3,0 --> 0:2:4,97
through one more time,
forgetting to put his thumb


65
0:2:4,97 --> 0:2:7,94
over the end of the straw, this
end pushes up, squeezes


66
0:2:7,94 --> 0:2:10,314
the air, and fires this
end at your head at


67
0:2:10,314 --> 0:2:12,2
about 35 miles an hour.


68
0:2:12,2 --> 0:2:13,72
That's awesome.


69
0:2:13,72 --> 0:2:17,6
This, ladies and gentlemen,
is my first potato gun.


70
0:2:17,6 --> 0:2:19,43
Now, today's day and age, you
can't say potato gun.


71
0:2:19,43 --> 0:2:22,19
It's a potato launcher.


72
0:2:22,19 --> 0:2:25,37
Our object, of course, is
just to make it bigger.


73
0:2:25,37 --> 0:2:27,56
You just need to have
a bigger straw.


74
0:2:27,56 --> 0:2:30,38
This is a good straw, this
is a better straw.


75
0:2:30,38 --> 0:2:32,93
And this is the straw that you
need to be able to make the


76
0:2:32,93 --> 0:2:34,5
larger potato launcher.


77
0:2:34,5 --> 0:2:37,3
Now, thanks to Lee Merrick, who
was a wonderful chemistry


78
0:2:37,3 --> 0:2:39,28
teacher, who's the first person
to show me this kind of


79
0:2:39,28 --> 0:2:41,59
clear piece--


80
0:2:41,59 --> 0:2:43,5
instead of using a
piece of PVC--


81
0:2:43,5 --> 0:2:44,87
so you can actually see
what's going on


82
0:2:44,87 --> 0:2:45,92
inside with the potato.


83
0:2:45,92 --> 0:2:48,61
The ends are flared
here and here.


84
0:2:48,61 --> 0:2:50,2
And I'll show you how to do
that here in just a second


85
0:2:50,2 --> 0:2:51,25
when you make your own.


86
0:2:51,25 --> 0:2:54,64
But this allows us to be able
to see the pieces of potato.


87
0:2:54,64 --> 0:2:58,9
So the first step is you carve
out a piece of potato, and it


88
0:2:58,9 --> 0:3:0,51
sits in this end, here.


89
0:3:0,51 --> 0:3:3,23
Now, the object is, we've got to
move this piece of potato,


90
0:3:3,23 --> 0:3:4,42
to this end over here.


91
0:3:4,42 --> 0:3:5,14
And to do that--


92
0:3:5,14 --> 0:3:6,9
I could use a dowel--


93
0:3:6,9 --> 0:3:8,45
I'm using this fancier
piece of plastic.


94
0:3:8,45 --> 0:3:10,105
A Lucite rod.


95
0:3:10,105 --> 0:3:12,47
And I'm simply going to take
this now, and push it


96
0:3:12,47 --> 0:3:13,72
to the other end.


97
0:3:13,72 --> 0:3:16,89



98
0:3:16,89 --> 0:3:17,84
Perfect.


99
0:3:17,84 --> 0:3:19,86
So we now have a place
to receive


100
0:3:19,86 --> 0:3:21,76
another piece of potato.


101
0:3:21,76 --> 0:3:22,74
Back to the plunging.


102
0:3:22,74 --> 0:3:27,69
You just carve out yet another
piece of potato and now this,


103
0:3:27,69 --> 0:3:29,37
is perfect to launch.


104
0:3:29,37 --> 0:3:31,38
Now, if I go back to my high
school days, they used this to


105
0:3:31,38 --> 0:3:34,69
be able to teach Boyle's Law,
that said this out of the text


106
0:3:34,69 --> 0:3:37,132
that was written when the earth
was still cooling--


107
0:3:37,132 --> 0:3:38,45
Boyle's Law.


108
0:3:38,45 --> 0:3:41,45
As you increase the pressure,
you decrease the volume of


109
0:3:41,45 --> 0:3:43,8
air, thus breaching the
integrity of the potato.


110
0:3:43,8 --> 0:3:46,41



111
0:3:46,41 --> 0:3:49,75
Here's the deal, in modern times
it kind of means this,


112
0:3:49,75 --> 0:3:53,83
jam hard this way, squish the
air, fire this at your friend.


113
0:3:53,83 --> 0:3:57,29
And to do that, you'll need
your safety glasses.


114
0:3:57,29 --> 0:3:59,69
And luckily for me, I have
a friend, and his name's


115
0:3:59,69 --> 0:4:1,77
Higginsworth.


116
0:4:1,77 --> 0:4:3,53
Higginsworth, you're going
to want to run.


117
0:4:3,53 --> 0:4:4,39
HIGGINSWORTH: What?


118
0:4:4,39 --> 0:4:6,17
STEVE SPANGLER: Run,
Higginsworth, run!


119
0:4:6,17 --> 0:4:8,57
Light on me, Higginsworth,
keep the light on me.


120
0:4:8,57 --> 0:4:10,6
Run!


121
0:4:10,6 --> 0:4:11,36
Now I know that's fun, and
you're going to want


122
0:4:11,36 --> 0:4:12,14
to make your own.


123
0:4:12,14 --> 0:4:14,54
And you probably want to make
one out of this clear, kind of


124
0:4:14,54 --> 0:4:16,4
Plexiglas polycarbonate.


125
0:4:16,4 --> 0:4:19,16
I can tell you that these are
fairly expensive, so I would


126
0:4:19,16 --> 0:4:21,89
suggest heading to the local
hardware store and making one


127
0:4:21,89 --> 0:4:23,43
out of PVC.


128
0:4:23,43 --> 0:4:25,58
Look at this piece
of 1/2 inch.


129
0:4:25,58 --> 0:4:26,57
And take a look at
this one, here.


130
0:4:26,57 --> 0:4:29,0
The thin wall is the way
that you want to go.


131
0:4:29,0 --> 0:4:31,34
While this is cheap and
inexpensive, this makes a


132
0:4:31,34 --> 0:4:33,62
better potato gun--
a launcher.


133
0:4:33,62 --> 0:4:35,0
All right, here's the secret.


134
0:4:35,0 --> 0:4:39,3
The secret is you need to bore
out the very end of the pipe.


135
0:4:39,3 --> 0:4:39,99
You see it there?


136
0:4:39,99 --> 0:4:42,63
That makes this narrow, so it's
a tapering kind of effect


137
0:4:42,63 --> 0:4:45,92
on this end, and on
this end, here.


138
0:4:45,92 --> 0:4:48,61
That way when you jam the potato
in, it really kind of


139
0:4:48,61 --> 0:4:50,88
sticks it in place
and holds it.


140
0:4:50,88 --> 0:4:52,73
And the secret is that drill.


141
0:4:52,73 --> 0:4:54,2
The second piece that
you're going to need


142
0:4:54,2 --> 0:4:55,22
is the pusher, right?


143
0:4:55,22 --> 0:4:56,42
That dowel rod.


144
0:4:56,42 --> 0:4:58,37
And what you're going to do is
you're going to find a piece


145
0:4:58,37 --> 0:5:1,7
of dowel rod that's just a
little bit bigger than the


146
0:5:1,7 --> 0:5:3,24
tube that you're using, because
you need something to


147
0:5:3,24 --> 0:5:4,23
be able to hold on to.


148
0:5:4,23 --> 0:5:6,3
And the second thing is, you
don't want to be jamming this


149
0:5:6,3 --> 0:5:8,33
in and accidentally
hit your thumb.


150
0:5:8,33 --> 0:5:12,1
That's why we simply just put a
piece of duct tape around it


151
0:5:12,1 --> 0:5:14,29
and colored it this way so
that it gives my thumb


152
0:5:14,29 --> 0:5:17,53
something to hold onto, and I
can jam it down in place.


153
0:5:17,53 --> 0:5:19,67
This is perfect.


154
0:5:19,67 --> 0:5:21,68
This is the hardest part and
the part of the video that


155
0:5:21,68 --> 0:5:23,3
you're going to replay
over and over.


156
0:5:23,3 --> 0:5:25,79
Because you need to remember
to carve out a piece of


157
0:5:25,79 --> 0:5:28,71
potato, like you have here, and
we're going to move this


158
0:5:28,71 --> 0:5:32,22
piece of potato to the
other end over here.


159
0:5:32,22 --> 0:5:34,53
Like this.


160
0:5:34,53 --> 0:5:37,1
When you hear that sound, you
know you're doing it right.


161
0:5:37,1 --> 0:5:39,41
So the first piece of
potato is here.


162
0:5:39,41 --> 0:5:42,8
This end is open to accept the
second piece of potato.


163
0:5:42,8 --> 0:5:44,74



164
0:5:44,74 --> 0:5:47,21
And now I'm ready to go.


165
0:5:47,21 --> 0:5:49,11
You've got to remember to wear
those safety glasses.


166
0:5:49,11 --> 0:5:51,5
When you take the dowel rod,
you've got to push it into


167
0:5:51,5 --> 0:5:53,4
this end, and it's ready
to accept it.


168
0:5:53,4 --> 0:5:56,21
So now I can hold on here,
and as I start to push--


169
0:5:56,21 --> 0:5:59,4
again I'm increasing the
pressure, decreasing the


170
0:5:59,4 --> 0:6:2,19
volume, and eventually that
end will pop out.


171
0:6:2,19 --> 0:6:3,93
Watch.


172
0:6:3,93 --> 0:6:5,65
That's a good one.


173
0:6:5,65 --> 0:6:8,13
And the most useful tip of
all, is to remember that


174
0:6:8,13 --> 0:6:10,57
there's still a piece of
potato lodged in here.


175
0:6:10,57 --> 0:6:12,61
Because if you put this in your
little science drawer and


176
0:6:12,61 --> 0:6:14,74
you forget about it, you're
going to smell the potato


177
0:6:14,74 --> 0:6:16,65
launcher long before
you use it again.


178
0:6:16,65 --> 0:6:20,52
So that's why you find another
piece of dowel that you can


179
0:6:20,52 --> 0:6:24,6
use at the very end to be able
to push the last piece of


180
0:6:24,6 --> 0:6:24,865
potato out.


181
0:6:24,865 --> 0:6:26,51
And now you're ready wash it,
and it's ready to go.


182
0:6:26,51 --> 0:6:29,345
You know, over the last two
decades, we as a country have


183
0:6:29,345 --> 0:6:31,55
spent a tremendous amount of
time trying to make science


184
0:6:31,55 --> 0:6:33,99
fun for kids and convince them
that science is fun.


185
0:6:33,99 --> 0:6:36,72
And I know that you know this,
but kids already know that


186
0:6:36,72 --> 0:6:37,64
science is fun.


187
0:6:37,64 --> 0:6:41,3
We have to convince teachers
that teaching science is fun.


188
0:6:41,3 --> 0:6:42,62
So we tried a little
experiment.


189
0:6:42,62 --> 0:6:44,94
We thought, what if we
had 160 of these?


190
0:6:44,94 --> 0:6:48,76
And we had 200 pounds of
potatoes, and we had 160 sets


191
0:6:48,76 --> 0:6:49,85
of safety glasses.


192
0:6:49,85 --> 0:6:52,75
What would it look like if you
dumped it all out, divided the


193
0:6:52,75 --> 0:6:56,65
group, and let them go to war?


194
0:6:56,65 --> 0:6:57,55
This is what it looked like.


195
0:6:57,55 --> 0:6:58,8
Take a look.


196
0:6:58,8 --> 0:7:3,39



197
0:7:3,39 --> 0:8:16,891
[MUSIC PLAYING]


198
0:8:16,891 --> 0:8:21,1



199
0:8:21,1 --> 0:8:23,36
STEVE SPANGLER: Closer,
closer.


200
0:8:23,36 --> 0:8:24,41
Run away, Higginsworth.


201
0:8:24,41 --> 0:8:24,82
Run!


202
0:8:24,82 --> 0:8:25,4
