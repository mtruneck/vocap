###0 we've talked about sexuality and how it's on the spectrum what happens when
###3 your bisexual you end up with uh... either why president and then
###7 years as your relationship you realize you-know-what i'm not really into mine
###11 what if any more i think i wanna sleep around with dilutes
###16 okay this is one way
###18 notebook back
###19 appetite another lie wife with that girl scout on that woman's hut
###24 for this bob
###26 but that path
###27 anyway wanted like that have happened jenny edmark bentley colin writes about
###32 a info on
###34 and it's a really fascinating case because he realize you know years into
###38 his marriage
###40 he loved his wife there is no question about it but he as he says and i'm
###44 quoting him verbatim start the habit
###46 hankering for men
###48 manhattan without them
###49 cell actually decide
###50 hookup
###52 tread activity and the three that was on the witness stand up
###56 so happy
###57 he can play with his wife he told her what the reality was that he act had
###61 been sleeping with
###62 uh... half a dozen men
###64 and uh... she
###66 hello would want more than a career
###68 it's like i was trading arms for the rest of the sixties
###72 cake yeah alright
###73 so her response was the most fascinating first of all questions that set because
###77 she felt like
###78 she didn't trust her enough to let her know from the very beginning he had lied
###81 to her
###82 but she also seems very openminded when it came to his sexuality and
###86 experimentation so try to the following a salon
###88 he said shiatsu felt constrained by marriage and she came to see
###92 that it was our spirit of adventure that had run us together in the first place
###96 and want to continue on that adventure with me
###99 but you're not the only one who wants to experiment sexually and sleep with other
###102 people would run on the right back atcha
###106 sunday
###107 did not divorce they both understood that their marriage was over
###113 that they retire marriage was over that phase of their marriage is over and they
###116 wanted to move on to a different phase a new and improved relationship where they
###120 say it would be to see if he cuts
###123 so they did something known as m_f_n_
###125 which is male female male uh... and basically it's a threesome with regard
###129 to that seat you get the picture
###131 and work on the same yet
###132 celebrate
###133 but anyway but that the fascinating part about this was the open-mindedness and
###137 the fact that
###139 they both realize that monogamy is a societal expectations right and we've
###144 all kinda signed onto that societal expectation and we all struggle with it
###148 and it's something that we could really try to be
###151 faithful and committed to
###152 uh... but they're like you know what we don't necessarily have to do that and
###155 through their experimentation and through their sex decades they've
###158 realized
###159 they've been really truly loved each other and they've been together for
###162 nineteen years
###163 so now they have been during all that i'm a firm suffer ninety years in the
###166 side is that m_f_m_
###168 they go their pollyanna recess they say they go and it's weighing these trade
###172 with couples and
###173 you know and
###174 evaluated all the sufferings the popeye
###177 of what i think it's a lot bravery for this guy to write about this is that
###181 to kids that are
###182 pretty much grown at this point
###184 and they're reading a and he's breaking all the rules in that sense
###188 now one thing i did agree i didn't believe his wife to swim if ever you
###191 cheated and woman always says a poor the guise of whatever it might be
###196 uh... it wasn't that she did
###197 it was that you liked it
###199 thank god i was a cheated out what was a guy got a bit like
###202 hey you know what
###203 come home one day and night are largely shop at the office in career good to me
###207 and a m thinking about you did you would like that
###210 cake that instant you know it's not how it's going to establish a obviously
###213 didn't have a problem with him and gauging intercourse with other people
###217 eventually wish your listeners is hockey tradition that goes with other guys do
###221 haha so
###223 as i was upset that everything was happening behind your back now that
###226 that's what is your opinion anyone did she went on
###229 acquires in that pretty much do you not that but i think by far the worst part
###235 people there but mutual friends for instance
###237 find out about it because then you feel embarrassed says that this is going on
###240 behind that
###241 is that i get that
###242 but look at the bottom line is when they finally came out local event
###245 unworthy to live with it now there's another
###248 personal report closes that marc watts not peace
###251 saying
###252 uh... when buying guys come out there was a
###254 that is all anecdotal stuff it's there's no hard research behind it but
###258 about a third of them
###259 the in need of wars
###261 and third
###262 are uh... did worse than about two years
###265 and therefore
###266 continue to have uh...
###268 and much more interesting marriage
###270 whether in illinois one of the standard is a more open about their sexuality
###274 then every sentence or two
###275 there were people
###277 if they're open about it enable like that
###280 had lost i wonder how many of them stay together for the sake of their so called
###285 family like make sure we don't split up because it'll be to charm attic for the
###288 can sure huge
###290 demolishes there we'd we don't really love each other we don't care for women
###293 in other but we do have an understanding that we both can and go to work on other
###297 people
###299 it if that's what pressing not known as item that's on the depressing
###303 look you know you love your kids and if europe
###306 any you have a mutual agreement the latter have relations with the people
###311 that's what's what's that about
