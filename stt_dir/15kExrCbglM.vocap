###18 -Do you still have your Grime ring?
###20 GRIME: Yeah, man.
###21 What do you think?
###22 That's 10 years old now.
###24 I made that ring 10 years ago.
###29 There it is.
###30 -Yes.
###31 
###33 GRIME: You said this was going to take three hours, you guys
###35 here eating up my Sunday.
###37 -Yes.
###38 GRIME: Hurry the fuck up.
###40 -You're more than welcome to go and do some stuff.
###42 Bet it would be very interesting to see you go to
###44 the post office.
###44 GRIME: Fuck you.
###46 -Do you have to go to the post office?
###47 GRIME: No, fuck you.
###48 -Why?
###49 It's just like your every day.
###50 Anyone can go see you
###51 tattooing or sitting somewhere.
###52 GRIME: They can?
###53 -Yeah.
###54 GRIME: That sounds horrifically banal.
###58 -All right.
###59 GRIME: All right.
###60 Oh fuck, I don't know.
###62 Now, you didn't tell me you wanted to look
###63 at a bunch of shit.
###64 Fuck, I don't know.
###67 There's a box laying here.
###69 It's been sitting here for months with blood all over it.
###71 
###75 Some of it's tracing, some of it's drawings.
###78 I guess some of these are tracings.
###81 Maybe there's not a lot of drawings in
###82 here, I don't know.
###84 
###86 GRIME: Oh, should I throw them away?
###89 I'll fucking sell them to people like you later.
###91 -We could just do a basic sit down now and then we'll go
###95 rifling through everything.
###96 GRIME: Is that what you think is going to happen?
###97 -Uh huh.
###98 In my mind, that's how it's going to play out.
###101 GRIME: What kind of rifling do you intend to do?
###105 Who are these viewers?
###107 -This'll probably get at least a million views.
###111 GRIME: All right.
###113 I've got a garage that fits your desires.
###116 -Really?
###116 In here?
###117 GRIME: Yeah, in here.
###120 All right, are you going to follow me then?
###122 -Lead on.
###124 GRIME: I don't know how much of my personal life you need
###126 to have in this thing.
###127 
###130 Come on, mister fucking I like to dig through shit.
###133 
###139 Oh, there's a lot of shit in here.
###143 Oh, you'll want this one.
###144 You got to see this board.
###145 This board's awesome.
###148 Here we go, here we go-- this is the gem right here.
###152 Yeah, this is Mark Gonzales's personal board from back in
###155 the day.
###155 -From?
###156 GRIME: Yeah, this is his board from when he was a kid.
###160 This thing's sick though, right?
###163 I bought that shit through the internets.
###166 I bought it fucking cheap.
###170 But, yeah, Mark Gonzales's personal board.
###172 This thing's so sick.
###173 I got this for like maybe $200.
###176 It's so stupid to think it's so cool.
###178 I don't know why people didn't want it.
###180 They wanted original boards that were unskated.
###181 I don't see how they lost out on how cool that is, you know?
###186 HENRY LEWIS: And you see his board collection.
###188 I mean, if you look at that and you mix that with modern
###191 tattooing and illustration work, I think that's where it
###194 all stems from.
###196 Like, his style and his color schemes in tattooing.
###200 Like, for example, that biomechanical sleeve.
###203 It has neon pink coming off of it.
###208 And then the majority of color that was kind of like a weird
###211 looking baby blue, that crept into this little organic dark
###216 umber green, going into olive sappy green.
###219 I think it's based from old school
###221 '80s skateboard graphics.
###222 And all that whole skater culture back then when he was
###227 in love with that stuff.
###228 You can tell that's where he came from.
###231 GRIME: How about that?
###233 -It's nice.
###234 GRIME: This thing's fucking sick.
###237 How about this thing?
###238 This thing's a fucking gem.
###239 I love this board.
###240 This board's the shit.
###242 Now, this one has such a good theme.
###244 -I've never even seen it.
###245 GRIME: How about this thing?
###249 Don't touch that.
###250 You can't touch this board.
###253 -I've never seen this color.
###254 GRIME: Yeah, that's because they made like three of them.
###257 I know for sure there's two of these that exist--
###260 two.
###261 But I don't know if there's more.
###262 I got it from the guys who screened it.
###264 They were trying out some new primer and
###267 then the black coat.
###268 And the coat, like they sprayed a bunch of boards and
###270 then they came back the next morning I think and then they
###275 all reacted.
###277 And they were like fuck it, we'll print them anyway and
###279 they printed them anyway.
###281 This board's awesome.
###284 GRIME: No, it's not a Chris Cole graphic, dude.
###287 It's a Rodney Mullen graphic.
###288 
###291 When'd you start skating?
###293 Fucking '89?
###295 -Did you have all these boards when you were younger?
###297 GRIME: No, I had some of them but I didn't have all of
###299 them-- no, of course.
###301 I grew up in Grand Junction, Colorado.
###304 -What was your town like?
###305 GRIME: Shit.
###306 -High school was--
###308 GRIME: Shit.
###308 -It was shitty?
###309 GRIME: Stupid.
###310 -What were you into?
###311 GRIME: Skateboarding and punk rock.
###315 Skateboarding and punk rock.
###316 -Were you always "The Grime?"
###319 GRIME: Yeah.
###321 -Is that a nickname?
###322 GRIME: Yeah.
###322 -Like, when you went to college did you introduce
###324 yourself as "Grime?"
###325 GRIME: No, no, no.
###327 I used it for my creative life, my artistic life.
###334 I started doing graffiti when I was really young.
###337 I was painting my name.
###338 I know that I had a tag running in Junction that had
###342 my name and next to it I wrote 1984.
###345 So I had tags running on a bridge from '84.
###348 And I don't even know why I did that, really.
###352 I mean, I know it's like a thing-- you
###353 people do that shit.
###354 But it wasn't like a one-time thing, it was a thing that I
###357 kind of enjoyed in a weird way or wanted to do.
###362 I think I enjoyed being creative, if you will.
###365 But I didn't see a line where to pull that creativity.
###369 Or how to use it, or that it was a viable thing outside--
###374 that it could be an occupation.
###376 It never occurred to me that I could be an artist as an
###379 occupation, I don't think, for a long time.
###382 When I was 19, I moved to Arizona to go to school, get
###385 out of my town.
###387 I'd been there a few times, and you could
###388 skateboard a lot there.
###390 There was good skateboarding there, and there was a lot of
###393 year-round skateboarding because of the weather.
###395 And I figured OK, fuck it, I'll go there.
###397 But also because I had been there.
###399 It was familiar, so it felt easier than like oh, maybe I
###402 should go to San Francisco.
###403 I've never been there, I should go.
###405 That would have felt a little too crazy.
###409 So I went there.
###410 And then after a while I thought oh, I got
###412 to get out of here.
###413 I had a desire to make tattoos since I was, I don't know,
###418 like maybe 15?
###420 And I remember it surfacing again maybe when I was 19 to
###423 20 years old.
###425 It surfaced again, and I thought I'm going to do it,
###426 I'm going to do it.
###427 When I had no idea how to do it.
###430 It was almost as hard as figuring out how
###434 to get to the moon.
###437 Oh, God, there's going to be some gems in here.
###442 This is some early shit right here.
###444 
###447 Oh shit, graffitis.
###450 This is like '90--
###452 oh God, I don't even know what.
###454 God, this stuff is terrible.
###457 This stuff is just terrible.
###461 Oh shit, first portrait I ever did.
###463 -What?
###465 You mean Arizona?
###466 GRIME: Yep.
###468 I didn't get very many tattoos at first because I
###470 didn't have any money.
###472 And I knew the kind of work I wanted to get and I
###474 couldn't afford it.
###475 So I waited until I got some money and I got
###478 tattoos that I wanted.
###480 
###483 I got tattooed by Marcus and Guy Aitchison and Eddie
###488 Deutsche and Aaron Cain.
###490 Those are the people I was getting tattooed by early.
###493 
###496 Yeah, I got tattooed by Marcus in '93.
###499 I came to SF-- it was maybe the second time I'd been to
###503 San Francisco.
###504 Marcus Pacheco was a huge influence on me.
###510 And he was one of the reasons I wanted to start tattooing
###512 anyway, seeing all of his work in tatt mags.
###515 -Marcus Pacheco owned Primal Urge.
###517 GRIME: He owned Primal Urge, yeah.
###519 Yeah, he did.
###520 -And that was what?
###521 GRIME: It was a tattoo shop, actually.
###523 They made tattoos there back in the day.
###526 It was in San Francisco, California.
###527 -Known for traditional sailor tattoos?
###529 GRIME: Yep.
###530 No, they weren't known for fucking--
###532 oh, shit the bed.
###534 They were not known for sailor tatts.
###536 They were known for very progressive
###538 tattooing at the time.
###539 Very, very progressive tattooing.
###540 They were doing stuff that really hadn't
###542 been tried in tattooing.
###543 If it had been, only in really small increments and in a kind
###548 of unheralded way, if you will.
###550 CHRIS O'DONNELL: For sure, it was like a very exciting time
###553 period for San Francisco.
###554 It seemed like a new phase was about to explode.
###560 I had a stack of magazines back in the early '90s just
###564 filled with so much garbage.
###566 So much awful work, but there was some good stuff, too.
###568 And I figured, obviously, I'll just take all the good stuff
###571 out, put it all in a book.
###572 So yeah, Marcus was doing all these really interesting
###575 tattoos, very painterly.
###577 Just very unique for the time.
###579 He was really pioneering that sort of idea that you could do
###581 more with it than just outline and shade and just things that
###587 nobody else was doing.
###588 Just very complicated work--
###591 very painterly.
###592 I definitely responded to that really early
###594 on, and so did Grime.
###595 GRIME: For me it was so attractive and creative.
###597 And his stuff was also technically always super solid
###600 and super perfect, basically.
###605 That it was a big draw when you saw something that was
###608 executed so well, it's just really attractive.
###613 My eyes really liked it.
###614 I was really drawn towards it.
###616 Marcus is the man.
###617 He taught me a ton of things.
###618 I definitely wouldn't be the tattooer I am if
###621 it wasn't for Marcus--
###622 like, 100%.
###624 Well, we worked together a few different times.
###628 CHRIS O'DONNELL: In my mind, his life started when he moved
###632 to San Francisco to work at Primal Urge.
###634 
###637 I can remember him being kind of quiet back then, actually.
###639 
###642 I didn't get a real sense of his personality
###643 when I first met him.
###645 I think he was just really involved in getting set up in
###648 San Francisco.
###649 GRIME: I was just focused on learning how to tattoo.
###652 There was no time to express myself.
###656 I was too busy studying tattooing.
###659 I was just drawing and looking at stuff and
###661 thinking about tattooing.
###664 LANGO OLIVEIRA: I know he was learning a lot from Marcus.
###666 And Marcus was like the biggest influence on my work
###670 and at the time like the biggest idol
###672 and all this stuff.
###673 So I really want to get a tattoo actually from Marcus.
###676 I tried kind of hard, but it would never happen.
###679 So I needed to get tattooed.
###680 So it was like fuck it, if this guy doesn't tattoo me
###682 I'll just get it from this guy Grime because he
###685 looks pretty good.
###687 This is supposed to be like a zombie chick or whatever.
###691 I was like 20 years old or something.
###693 On this one I didn't say anything.
###695 I was like, dude, just draw me something sick.
###697 I don't fucking know.
###698 CHRIS O'DONNELL: His style of tattooing was way more
###701 exaggerated than it is now.
###703 I mean, every detail you could put into a tattoo, he was
###705 doing more than that.
###707 GRIME: I don't think I suffered for too long in the
###709 beginning of tattooing.
###711 I think I did pretty well with the technical side, but it
###714 then takes forever to get a vision.
###718 CHRIS O'DONNELL: He was just trying everything.
###721 Grime had a huge buzz.
###723 His work was immediately so unique that everybody
###726 immediately noticed.
###727 And that was back in the day when if you had a magazine
###729 article in "International Tattoo Art," or whatever, it
###732 would get you noticed in the industry.
###734 Now there's so many magazines and no one notices if you have
###737 an article anymore.
###738 But back then, that was a big deal.
###741 And that kind of solidified his status in the San
###746 Francisco scene.
###749 GRIME: Oh look, that was in a magazine.
###753 Look, it's so flashy.
###754 
###756 -So at the time what'd you think when you
###758 finished that tattoo?
###759 GRIME: I was psyched.
###761 So were a lot of other people.
###763 So were a lot of other people.
###766 So were a lot of other people.
###768 
###772 All right, I think we're done.
###776 I don't think there's anything extra special in here.
###779 I don't know what else is down here, dude.
###781 I don't have anything.
###783 Look at me, I can't even go out.
###785 I got you guys fucking keeping me in.
###788 -We're going to go get ice cream.
###790 GRIME: We're good?
###791 -Yeah, we're good in here.
###792 GRIME: You done?
###792 -No, we're not done.
###793 GRIME: Make you happy?
###794 -We are not done.
###794 GRIME: That make you happy?
###795 -I'm almost happy.
###797 A little bit.
###798
