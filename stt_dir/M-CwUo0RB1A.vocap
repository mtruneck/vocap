###0 
###5 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, you can see it [INAUDIBLE].
###7 
###10 MIKE CARROLL: All right.
###10 Way to go, huh?
###11 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###13 MIKE CARROLL: All right.
###14 What's up, dude?
###15 MALE SPEAKER: What's up?
###16 MIKE CARROLL: All right.
###17 What's happening?
###18 PATRICK O'DELL: What's up?
###19 Welcome back to the show.
###20 We're here at Deluxe.
###21 We're meeting up with Girl and Anti-Hero, and we're going on
###24 the Beauty and the Beast Tour, which is through northern
###27 California, Oregon, Washington.
###30 And I've never been on tour with either of these
###32 companies, so I'm kind of nervous and excited.
###36 Because it seems to be more than just like
###38 a regular old tour.
###39 This is like a really sick tour.
###42 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###43 You've got to wear like smaller pants or
###45 whatever with that one.
###46 PATRICK O'DELL: You're going to wear all Anti-Hero gear?
###48 MIKE CARROLL: Yeah.
###48 And they're going to wear our all-over print Girl gear.
###52 MALE SPEAKER: This one fits better, right?
###55 PATRICK O'DELL: You guys trading outfits?
###56 AARON MEZA: No.
###57 That's just Mike's weird fantasies.
###60 PATRICK O'DELL: Oh.
###61 Do you think Girl and Anti-Hero
###62 have anything in common?
###64 JIM THIEBAUD: Yeah, they're both awesome skateboard teams.
###67 They're the dudes.
###69 They know what they're doing.
###72 I think they're similar in the fact that they're just both
###73 all run by the guys who ride for them, and that shows in
###76 everything they do.
###77 And this was an awesome idea, that I can't wait to fucking
###80 see what happens.
###81 I was talking to Julian.
###83 It feels like the last couple of days we were calling each
###85 other and just like, can you believe this is happening?
###87 You ready?
###88 Are you ready?
###88 And to me it feels like it's almost like a big video
###92 premiere, or some bullshit thing where you're like, oh my
###94 god, it's going to happen.
###95 And I can't fucking wait.
###98 It's going to be really cool.
###99 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###99 PATRICK O'DELL: It's a 10-day trip, right?
###101 And there's only like three things on the schedule.
###104 JIM THIEBAUD: As it should be.
###107 I'm sure it'll be filled with other
###109 things rather than demos.
###110 
###115 MALE SPEAKER: How you doing?
###117 
###119 MALE SPEAKER: Is this your dog?
###121 [LAUGHTER]
###123 ROBBIE RUSSO: Look at the poop.
###124 It just peed on the floor.
###125 MALE SPEAKER: Oh, shit.
###128 PATRICK O'DELL: Where'd you get that tent?
###129 ROBBIE RUSSO: At the dog store.
###130 PATRICK O'DELL: The dog store?
###131 ROBBIE RUSSO: I don't know.
###132 Dog something.
###134 PATRICK O'DELL: What do you think Girl and
###135 Anti-Hero have in common?
###136 TONY MIORANA: Legendary dudes.
###137 Skater of the years.
###139 They got several of those.
###142 Sick-ass teams.
###143 Good people to hang out with.
###145 They've both got roots.
###147 They've got deep roots in skating.
###150 You respect all the dudes who started
###152 both of those companies.
###156 JOHN ALDEN: Fuck, seems like we were talking about it for a
###158 long time, like just bullshitting.
###160 Like it would be so sick to fucking go out with those
###162 dudes, just kind of like joking.
###164 Somehow it fucking worked out.
###168 DARIN HOWARD: This is a trip I'd love to be on, like a fly
###171 on the wall.
###172 Fuck, it's going to be nuts.
###174 Yeah.
###175 Once in a lifetime kind of thing, you know?
###177 
###183 MALE SPEAKER: Girl!
###183 Arr.
###184 [HOWLS AND CHEERS]
###186 
###189 [HORN HONKS]
###192 MALE SPEAKER: Hopefully we make it back.
###194 
###208 RICK HOWARD: Fuck yeah, dude.
###212 Wow.
###213 This is nice.
###214 What's up, Tony?
###216 Yeah, dude.
###217 I'm good.
###219 TONY TRUJILLO: I'm good.
###219 I'm doing it.
###221 Fucking get some of that, dude.
###222 RICK HOWARD: Yeah, that's fucking mysterious
###224 [INAUDIBLE].
###225 
###244 PATRICK O'DELL: So whose idea was this for the tour?
###248 JULIEN STRANGER: It was their idea.
###249 A couple years ago it came up as like Anti-Hero versus Girl,
###253 and I was way not into that, because we'd just get our ass
###256 kicked all over the place.
###258 It kind of took a couple years to find the right plan.
###264 When I was on teams when I was a lot younger, I was always
###267 really stoked on the team aspect, like a
###270 good group of friends.
###271 And that was more important than necessarily how good a
###275 guy was, or if they won contests or anything.
###277 It was just like you had to get the right people together.
###279 And I think that's what these guys do.
###280 I think that's what we do.
###282 You don't treat skaters like meat.
###284 They're not pro athletes.
###285 They're friends.
###287 Both companies really care about skateboarding, and just
###290 want to keep it really interesting for people like
###292 ourselves, for our peers, not just create a commodity.
###296 It's everything more than money.
###299 And these guys wanted to unwind after the Lakai thing,
###302 after all the pressure they put themselves through the
###304 Lakai thing.
###304 So I think it's just to blow off a lot of steam for them,
###307 and a chance for all of us to go skate.
###309 RICK HOWARD: Yeah.
###310 
###313 MIKE CARROLL: Probably a few months before, we had just
###315 finished Fully Flared.
###316 So the Beauty and the Beast trip was pretty much like a
###319 vacation with skateboards and stuff, so
###322 it was pretty awesome.
###324 And it was just like a, ah, I like skateboarding again, type
###330 of feeling.
###331 
###335 ALEX OLSON: I don't know, this one just was like, let's go on
###338 a trip and go skate.
###339 It was like going with all your buddies.
###342 No one cared about getting photos or tricks, and just
###346 like everyone wanted just to go skate.
###349 Which was super nice compared to the last couple
###353 of trips I was on.
###355 I was filming Gnarly for the Lakai trips.
###358 
###374 Personally, I thought like everyone on both teams wanted
###377 to put the right impression for each other.
###380 So everyone was walking on eggshells at first, and you're
###383 kind of nervous, like you don't know
###384 what's going to happen.
###386 We've never been on a trip with these guys.
###388 We don't know how they roll.
###390 MALE SPEAKER: Woo.
###392 Three beers out.
###395 ALEX OLSON: Yeah, everyone I think was like tripping, like
###396 whoa, because everyone respected everyone.
###399 I've never hung out with John before, or
###401 talked to him, really.
###402 Maybe seen John a couple times.
###404 I'm like--
###405 or like went around the corner, and I was like, ooh,
###407 that's John Cardiel.
###408 
###421 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###422 JOHN CARDIEL: What's up, fellas?
###423 MALE SPEAKER: Got to do your chores before you leave.
###425 JOHN CARDIEL: Yeah, man.
###425 I was thinking.
###426 I was like, you know what?
###427 I don't want to come back--
###427 MALE SPEAKER: And have a [INAUDIBLE]?
###428 JOHN CARDIEL: Yeah, and then it gets caught in the fucking
###431 mower, and it stops and everything.
###434 Bad one.
###436 Wood, it gets all locked up.
###440 ALEX OLSON: I think the Girl guys were more intimidated by
###442 the Anti-Hero guys for sure.
###444 And then everyone got like comfortable with everyone, and
###446 then it was super cool.
###449 SAM: Hey, John.
###450 JOHN CARDIEL: Yeah, what up, Sam?
###451 SAM: Chilling, man.
###451 How are you?
###452 JOHN CARDIEL: Good, good, good.
###453 John.
###454 MALE SPEAKER: John.
###454 JOHN CARDIEL: Nice to meet you.
###455 
###458 RICK MCCRANK: You guys like Brazilian Super Juice?
###460 
###465 ROBBIE RUSSO: Whoa.
###466 
###470 MALE SPEAKER: We got your cruiser, John.
###471 JOHN CARDIEL: OK, cool.
###473 
###476 TONY TRUJILLO: Hold the crank down.
###477 I'll hold this like that.
###479 MALE SPEAKER: All right.
###481 
###484 JOHN CARDIEL: Yeah, I'm ready to get out, now.
###487 This our shit?
###489 MALE SPEAKER: You got the tent and everything in there?
###490 JOHN CARDIEL: Yeah, dude.
###491 I'm straighty eight.
###492 I'm so fucking ready to go.
###494 I've got all my shit, right, all my camping stuff.
###497 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###498 JOHN CARDIEL: Fucking straight.
###499 MALE SPEAKER: Hey John, you want to be on this side?
###501 RICK HOWARD: Where we going, Alex?
###502 Tell Patrick where we're headed.
###504 ALEX OLSON: We're going to go get food right now.
###505 I have not a clue where we're going, though.
###507 I want to go skateboard.
###508 PATRICK O'DELL: Where we going?
###510 RICK HOWARD: We don't know yet.
###511 It's just by the moment.
###514 And then we're going to get on the road to our first
###517 destination, pitch a tent.
###520 Rick's going to tell us some--
###521 MALE SPEAKER: Ghost stories.
###522 RICK HOWARD: Some ghost stories.
###523 MALE SPEAKER: What happened to me.
###525 [LAUGHTER]
###526
