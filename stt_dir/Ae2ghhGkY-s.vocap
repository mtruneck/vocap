###52 "This is pointless."
###67 This is very good, Professor, thank you.
###73 That wasn't so hard, was it?
###79 So does this look wrong to you?
###81 "Yeah."
###83 "Because it is wrong."
###85 Because it's missing 'Bleem'.
###89 "You think I just made this up, don't you?"
###92 "Just pulled this number out of thin air, yah?"
###94 So you have discovered 'bleem' then?
###96 "I am not entertaining some delusion, Doctor. I am a mathematician -"
###102 "I am pursuing the truth."
###105 I'm sorry, I'm not trying to offend you, I'm just trying to understand.
###112 But I need you to help me understand.
###114 "Are you trying to understand 'bleem', Doctor?"
###119 "Or are you trying to understand >me<?"
###168 Okay, Professor.
###171 Let's assume that you're right and 'bleem' does exist.
###176 It'd be a counting number, right?
###178 "It is an integer, yah."
###180 Integer.
###182 So you go 1, 2, 3...
###187 …'bleem,' 4, 5, 6 - is that right?
###191 "Very good, Doctor"
###194 Right, so if that's true...
###197 ...you should then be able to have 'bleem' of something, right?
###201 "Yeah."
###206 I'd like you to do me a favor, Professor.
###213 Separate out 'bleem' of those jellybeans for me.
###222 Please...
###223 ...take your time.
###275 So 'bleem' is not an integer after all.
###285 Professor.
###289 So 'Bleem' is not an integer...
###290 "AHH!"
###292 "Bleem exists!"
###295 Calm down, Professor.
###296 "Something was preventing me--"
###299 I was sitting right here.  I was watching you the entire time--
###303 -- and there was nothing preventing you, except for the fact that 'bleem' does not exist.
###309 "I must get back to my research..."
###315 I'm sorry, Professor. I'm afraid we're done for the day.
###320 "I just need something to write with."
###323 "Please. Pencil and paper is all I ask."
###325 We can talk about writing materials at your next evaluation, alright?
###345 "Doctor?"
###348 Take the Professor to his room.
###350 "Please, I am so close- I can feel it."
###353 We can pick this up tomorrow.
###354 "Come on, Professor."
###355 "No--"
###359 "Take it easy!"
###469 So would you say you are a man of reason, Professor?
###473 "Of course, yah."
###474 Well, I'm a little confused...
###476 ...what reason could anybody possibly have to keep a number secret?
###482 "Why did they try to burn Galileo at the stake, Doctor? This is heresy to them."
###491 "We're talking about the very fabric of our universe here."
###496 "What do you know about higher dimensions, Doctor?"
###501 What, like parallel universes?
###504 "No, these are dimensions beyond what we can experience with our senses."
###509 "The first four are taken up by the Minkowski Space-Time, which we live with every day."
###515 "But physicists now tell us there are at least seven more dimensions we cannot access."
###522 "Abstract dimensions that permeate everything - yet remain completely hidden."
###531 Alright.
###533 "We have no way to grasp the possibilities - to tap us the potential of these dimensions… because we haven't got the math."
###544 So you are suggesting that with 'bleem'-
###550 "'Bleem' changes everything."
###556 Thank you, Professor.
###607 Hey!
###617 Hey!
###630 "This next report comes from Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where on Thursday an unidentified man was struck and killed by a car near Pinewood Elementary school."
###639 "But beyond the tragedy, a mystery has emerged as authorities have made no progress in determining the victim's identity in the three days since the incident."
###649 "Police Chief Hal Malick is referring to the lack of any leads as 'bizarre'. More on the story as it develops."
###657 "In other news..."
###680 Yeah?
###702 "We are doing a second sweep now. He was definitely here at bedcheck, I haven't let anyone into the room."
###752 "Ah, looks like he left us a little snack."
###758 Don't touch those!
###773 "It's just jellybeans, Doc. Want one?"
