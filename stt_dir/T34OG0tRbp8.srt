is right here in the house.

tell you, my dream

believe how well it works.

I didn't think it'd
be that smooth.


14

You know, it always
looked, in the movies,


15
0:0:25,42 --> 0:0:26,545
like it was just awkward.


16
0:0:26,545 --> 0:0:27,61
It was going sideways.

it, it felt natural.

riding it, you know what to do.

there was an election.
