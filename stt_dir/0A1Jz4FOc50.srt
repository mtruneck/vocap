1
0:0:1,5 --> 0:0:3,0
The Sudan,
the largest


2
0:0:3,0 --> 0:0:4,0
country in Africa,


3
0:0:4,0 --> 0:0:5,955
lies where the
Sahara Desert


4
0:0:5,955 --> 0:0:8,0
meets the grasslands
of the Sahel.


5
0:0:8,0 --> 0:0:11,0
Its westernmost region
is called Darfur.


6
0:0:11,0 --> 0:0:13,0
Though small
compared to


7
0:0:13,0 --> 0:0:14,5
the rest of the Sudan,


8
0:0:14,5 --> 0:0:17,21
the three provinces
that make up Darfur


9
0:0:17,21 --> 0:0:22,5
are nearly the size of France.


10
0:0:22,5 --> 0:0:24,837
Far from the capital
in Khartourn,


11
0:0:24,837 --> 0:0:26,967
the region has been
neglected for years


12
0:0:26,967 --> 0:0:28,165
by the government.


13
0:0:28,165 --> 0:0:32,505
Darfur means
"Land of the Fur."


14
0:0:32,505 --> 0:0:36,385
A Muslim African tribe
indigenous to the area.


15
0:0:36,385 --> 0:0:38,155
The region is inhabited
by many tribes


16
0:0:38,155 --> 0:0:40,588
that are
racially and culturally


17
0:0:40,588 --> 0:0:41,7
intertwined.


18
0:0:41,7 --> 0:0:43,567
But despite these
cultural similarities,


19
0:0:43,567 --> 0:0:45,362
groups of farmers,
who are viewed


20
0:0:45,362 --> 0:0:46,78
as African


21
0:0:46,78 --> 0:0:48,568
and groups of herders,


22
0:0:48,568 --> 0:0:50,155
who are considered Arab,


23
0:0:50,155 --> 0:0:52,76
have had clashes
over the land for decades.


24
0:0:52,76 --> 0:0:53,98
Droughts,


25
0:0:53,98 --> 0:0:54,745
famines,


26
0:0:54,745 --> 0:0:56,168
desertification


27
0:0:56,168 --> 0:0:57,677
and population pressures


28
0:0:57,677 --> 0:1:1,801
have added to
the rising tensions.


29
0:1:1,801 --> 0:1:3,12
Since 2003,
rebel groups


30
0:1:3,12 --> 0:1:5,877
have fought against
the government


31
0:1:5,877 --> 0:1:8,533
accusing it
of supporting the Arab herders


32
0:1:8,533 --> 0:1:12,7
over the African farmers.


33
0:1:12,7 --> 0:1:14,86
The government's response
caused a mass exodus


34
0:1:14,86 --> 0:1:17,25
forcing villagers
to become refugees


35
0:1:17,25 --> 0:1:20,463
in their own homeland.


36
0:1:20,463 --> 0:1:23,703
In this United Nations
refugee camp


37
0:1:23,703 --> 0:1:25,597
along the
Chad-Sudan border,


38
0:1:25,597 --> 0:1:28,745
the women and children here
have found a safe haven


39
0:1:28,745 --> 0:1:30,798
from the Janjawe,
the armed militias


40
0:1:30,798 --> 0:1:34,76
of Arab herders
organized by the government


41
0:1:34,76 --> 0:1:38,76
to fight the rebels
and kill civilians.


42
0:1:38,76 --> 0:1:41,457
Entire villages
have been burned.


43
0:1:41,457 --> 0:1:44,5
Hundreds of thousands
have died.


44
0:1:44,5 --> 0:1:46,5
Beatings,
rapes


45
0:1:46,5 --> 0:1:50,0
and mutilations
are used as weapons of terror.


46
0:1:50,0 --> 0:1:52,5
Around 2 million people


47
0:1:52,5 --> 0:1:55,5
almost a third of
Darfur's population


48
0:1:55,5 --> 0:1:57,713
have fled their villages.


49
0:1:57,713 --> 0:1:59,917
These refugees have
lost everything.


50
0:1:59,917 --> 0:2:2,682
But they are
the lucky ones.


51
0:2:2,682 --> 0:2:5,882
Most still wander the land
unable to go home.


52
0:2:5,882 --> 0:2:10,102
Their lives still
at risk.


53
0:2:10,102 --> 0:2:12,22
Though peace talks
have been organized,


54
0:2:12,22 --> 0:2:15,0
the fighting
still continues.


55
0:2:15,0 --> 0:4:15,0
And in Darfur
the people are still dying.
