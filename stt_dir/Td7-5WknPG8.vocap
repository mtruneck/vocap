###4 MALE SPEAKER: So it's my great pleasure
###6 to introduce Bob Frankston, who imagined
###9 a world with a spreadsheet before computers really
###13 had a useful thing to do.
###15 And so it was world changing, and I
###19 think what's really interesting is when
###23 I met with Bob a couple weeks ago and we start talking,
###25 we immediately got into a really strong agreement
###28 and a really good argument all within about four minutes.
###31 And so I thought, that's the kind of guy
###32 I want to talk here.
###33 So thanks for coming, Bob.
###35 I really appreciate it.
###36 BOB FRANKSTON: OK.
###36 
###40 As some people here know, my history
###42 goes back well before VisiCalc, which is actually Dan's idea.
###45 
###48 I will go through history, but let's start the talk.
###53 Hit the space bar.
###54 That's a good way to move forward.
###56 So I'm going to start at the end point.
###58 Both of the talk, where the high-level issues are,
###62 and the sense that I interested in the endpoints
###64 of connections, and not all the network crap in the middle.
###68 So the internet itself is just a technique.
###70 It's the way we can use whatever is available to communicate.
###73 The problem is that we have all these people who
###76 think the internet is important.
###78 That's thinking that there is a thing called the internet.
###81 And they sort of have to defend it and make it work.
###85 And for me, it's just that stuff in the middle.
###88 I just start with what you do with it.
###90 And you mentioned using VisiCalc, some people at the St
###93 Student Information Processing Board
###95 at MIT, which I co-founded in '69, trying
###98 to get people to use computers back then.
###100 I had a sense they were useful.
###102 Nobody believed me.
###104 And this is that actually the culture, the Project MAC,
###108 which is in the building that's inside one of the Novartis
###110 buildings now, which is the attitude of how
###115 do we make this technology useful?
###117 What can we do with it?
###119 So I'm skipping outside my talk, but for me the slides
###122 are mainly a guide.
###123 They try to keep me on track.
###127 There will be lots of points we can discuss later I'll
###129 just mention.
###130 One of the big insights is the least important thing
###134 we do is exchange content.
###137 Now that might sound heretical, but how many people
###140 have ever sent a copy of Wikipedia?
###143 You just say the word Wikipedia.
###145 You refer to it.
###145 You never send it.
###147 And that's part of the secret about what makes this work.
###151 Yet all our policies, all our measures
###153 of broadband and everything, running out of internet,
###156 are based on the idea we're shipping exabytes of data
###160 through this one router, which must
###162 be in the middle of Kansas City.
###163 
###166 But for me, the internet is really about opportunity.
###168 How do we create opportunity to do things at the-- well,
###172 there's no real edge, but outside of the net?
###175 
###178 And the other important point is that the internet
###181 is a discontinuity.
###183 When you read the classic histories of in the internet,
###188 they start with the ARPANET and have a packet radio.
###190 No, that's nonsense.
###192 Yes, the excellent technologies were there,
###196 but the interent really started from a very different
###199 beginning.
###200 It was the revolt against networking as a service.
###205 You didn't need a third party along the way
###207 to read your telegram like a scribe
###209 and repeat it down the line.
###212 You do it yourself.
###213 You just exchang these meaningless bits.
###216 And one of the really horrendous legacies we're still stuck with
###220 is the idea the carrier in the middle
###221 must make a profit for you to do anything.
###224 And I was reminded of this.
###226 I understand why companies need to make a profit,
###228 the question is whether that's the right model.
###231 For example, airlines.
###232 I don't have a better idea for airlines.
###235 But the consequence is I'm not going
###237 to be able to get to Los Vegas tomorrow because airlines
###240 no longer have enough extra equipment.
###243 So basically, they canceled my flight
###245 because a gear was stuck somewhere
###248 and there's absolutely no resilience.
###249 The whole system shuts down.
###252 And maybe airlines have to do it.,
###254 but for us to use that technology for networking
###256 is absurd.
###259 So as I said, the internet is a technique
###261 for doing things ourselves.
###263 Now, I put in DIO as a broader point
###265 because doing it ourselves doesn't mean you do it alone.
###269 It could be doing it ourselves if you
###271 have communities that work together.
###274 But it's easy to just think of DIY as opposed
###278 to depending on a third party.
###279 Do it yourself.
###280 
###285 The other thing that we're going to get to is once meaning
###287 is outside the network-- oh, I just
###291 realized you're not seeing my slides.
###293 MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE] slides?
###295 BOB FRANKSTON: Yes, there are slides here.
###296 I'm more coherent than I seem, because the explanation is up
###299 on the slides.
###301 Speaking of depending on a third party
###303 and not having eyes in the back of my head.
###305 
###309 Ah, there it is.
###310 I won't go back to the other pictures,
###312 nor show my beautiful picture of the trolley in the snow.
###315 
###318 That explains why you were actually looking at me
###320 and seemed to be awake.
###321 
###331 I can go all the way back, but that's not important.
###333 So there's where you see DIY versus DIO.
###335 You wondered why I was-- OK.
###338 Do I seem more coherent now that you can see it?
###340 OK.
###341 So what does this mean?
###344 This is really about taking advantage of opportunities.
###348 And we're limited by discovering what we can do.
###352 For example, voice over IP was a discovery.
###357 Yes, we could get to work in some cases
###359 in the early studies, but how can you do voice over a-- when
###363 you lose your package, you got high jitter.
###366 Just like TV.
###366 People thought we need asynchronous TV.
###369 But some people were creative and figured out
###371 ways to take advantage of opportunities.
###373 Now it's not always obvious.
###374 
###377 The reason VoIP it works now has nothing
###380 to do with making VoIP work.
###383 It was the web that gave us the capacity.
###386 If we try to make VoIP work, we actually did.
###389 It's called SS7.
###392 Does anybody want to buy a used phone network?
###394 It's too expensive to maintain.
###395 
###399 But the key is to have an appropriate business model.
###403 And this is one of the main messages.
###405 So we don't need a third party the middle like the airlines
###408 do.
###409 Have to run at the edge, to only do what's profitable.
###414 It's sort of like depending on the railroad
###416 to get to a destination.
###418 Not many railroads are willing to tracks up Mount Everest.
###420 
###424 So we want to get away from this idea of the provider making
###427 profit for us to do anything.
###429 The other problem we have with the current business model
###433 is that providers' worst enemy, the people
###438 they fear the most, the existential threat,
###441 are the customers.
###443 There's a customer buying from Netflix
###446 will remove all the profit of selling content,
###448 as the cable companies do now.
###450 And there's a slide show I point to on my site
###454 from the cellular industry explaining that abundance
###459 is the greatest threat.
###462 That if they don't prevent abundance,
###465 people are not going to buy the services.
###468 So if you wondered why there's a problem with broadband crisis,
###474 it's obvious.
###475 
###478 Giving the customers enough capacity is a losing idea.
###483 So this is not sustainable.
###484 We need to have a sustainable business model,
###487 and this is, again, Google, since you use connectivity,
###491 to encourage capacity.
###493 
###499 As I said, we exchange references, not contact.
###501 Capacity is not the same as bandwidth.
###505 It turns out we have so much capacity,
###507 we're using, at the first approximation,
###508 0% of our capacity.
###512 And that's what's a conflict of interest.
###516 So there is an alternative model,
###519 which is the way we fund sidewalks.
###521 The sidewalk owner does not view the user
###524 as a competitive threat.
###527 But people talk about privatizing the Mass Pike.
###531 Then Route 30 becomes a competitive threat.
###534 We already saw this in Detroit.
###536 There's a private bridge in Detroit.
###538 They try to keep the city from building a public bridge
###541 because it's competition.
###543 So you've really got to be careful about what
###546 incentives we create.
###549 Now the resource I describe as ambient connectivity,
###555 and I use this term for the idea of wherever you are,
###558 you could just assume connectivity.
###560 Now this is sort of like having open Wi-Fi everywhere,
###563 except I don't want to tie it to any particular technology.
###567 Current Wi-Fi is much better than it might be,
###571 but it's still a problematic technology.
###575 But the key is to be able to assume
###578 we're connected wherever we are.
###579 I'll get more into this.
###581 I add the word permissionless because people somehow
###585 seem to assume you've got to show your credentials to prove
###588 you can pay for it.
###589 But how many of you have to show that you're
###592 authorized to use a sidewalk?
###594 That's the exception, not the rule.
###595 
###599 And the thing to realize is this whole idea of networking,
###604 we so implicitly have a provider-centric view.
###608 We talk about the network as what's important,
###610 and how you maintain the network.
###612 And as we'll see, our language, our framework
###614 is infused with a provider-centric view
###618 of protocols and everything.
###621 What you have to do is forget about the network.
###623 I want to be able to think just about the relationships
###626 between the two endpoints and what I'm trying to accomplish.
###629 It should just work everywhere.
###630 Or you shouldn't have to log into this or connect to this.
###633 Yes?
###633 AUDIENCE: One of the big struggles we've had
###635 is that users want to be able to define what they get
###639 from an ISP, and the ISP is usually unwilling to commit.
###644 BOB FRANKSTON: We shouldn't have the concept of an ISP
###646 because the interent is not a service that's being pumped out
###649 of the salt mines in Louisiana.
###652 It's what we do with the available resources.
###654 The internet is a technique.
###655 
###658 That's what I'm saying about flipping the model.
###660 People assume they have to ask the ISP.
###662 No, you're important.
###664 The ISP should come to you and say, please, I want a job.
###668 Can I do anything for you?
###669 
###678 I'm very interested in how language works,
###680 so I have to use language people are familiar with.
###682 So I say open access, even though words like that
###685 are still provider-centric.
###686 
###688 One of the big words we use, terrible words, is broadband.
###692 What is broadband?
###693 
###697 AUDIENCE: Effectively, a bigger pipe than the other.
###699 BOB FRANKSTON: Well actually, it's
###700 a technical term that comes from radio technology.
###704 It turns out the companies that extended the TV antennas up
###708 the top of the mountain took the broadband over the air signals
###711 and put it on a coaxial cable, versus baseband.
###714 And that became-- we're going to give examples later--
###717 associated with a business model because that's
###719 the way language works.
###720 
###722 And then it became literally a contronym.
###727 Literally itself has become a contronym.
###730 A contronym is a word that's its own antonym.
###733 And the way language works, literally fills
###734 in the same slot as figuratively,
###736 so people tend to confuse the two.
###738 So broadband we use to mean the internet, when the internet is
###741 really what you tunnel through despite the broadband business
###744 model.
###746 This is what makes it so hard to talk about this.
###749 And I have to emphasize, I'm talking about an architecture,
###751 not any particular implementation.
###753 So when I talk about having open Wi-Fi, that's just an example.
###758 It's one way to do it.
###759 
###762 What amazes me is how often it's, oh, we'll
###763 give you wireless mesh.
###766 First, why do I say wireless?
###768 A wire is just a wave guide for signals.
###771 There's nothing wrong with wires.
###773 And mesh is just a particular technology.
###776 And if I've got a fiber that takes me across the country,
###778 why do I want a bucket brigade?
###780 It's an economic problem to solve,
###783 and technology's just a means.
###785 What we do have to do is preserve
###786 the magic of it just works.
###789 And that's the real architectural goal.
###791 That's the power of architecture.
###794 Network just disappears.
###795 
###798 And apps can use any available means, including the QR codes.
###801 So if we're just exchanging a reference,
###803 I just give you a QR code.
###805 So one way to explain this is our view
###808 of the history of what I call digital.
###810 Now when I say digital, I mean discrete symbols.
###813 It doesn't mean 10 fingers.
###815 But the fact that we can have these sharp distinctions
###818 and you can regenerate the meaning.
###820 That's the real value.
###821 The zeroes and ones are going to be regenerated.
###823 But it's also alphabets.
###826 If I write letters, even-- . pictographics.
###831 Hieroglyphics were very distinct symbols.
###833 Little off, you can guess what it is again.
###836 And that allowed the message to be preserved over distance.
###839 You can carry the message.
###840 If it got a little distorted, you can correct it.
###842 Smudged.
###843 But also over time.
###845 And we actually had some forward error correcting
###847 oral traditions, but that's for when
###849 you want a discussion of details of language.
###852 But one of the legacies of the early days
###859 of inarticulate digital is the telegraph.
###862 We had to use the wire to keep the single contained,
###865 to maintain the relationships between the bits,
###867 the endpoints.
###868 So it flooded our skies with all these wires.
###873 Every call needed its own wire.
###877 And you think that's bad?
###880 Even when we had wireless, no wires,
###882 we created virtual wires.
###884 This cockamamie idea of single frequency signaling
###889 creates scarcity.
###891 It's as if we said no two people in the room
###895 could wear a blue shirt because it'll be confused.
###899 Interference is not a property of physics.
###901 Waves pass through each other.
###903 Interference is another word for confusion.
###907 So whenever anybody talks about interference,
###909 they're just saying we're creating confusion.
###910 If you use all the rich data, and in a sense,
###914 if you look at meaning come from context,
###917 big data's fundamental.
###919 Information in isolation is meaningless.
###922 Yet our telecommunications system
###924 is trying to carefully preserve--
###926 this is the inarticulate digital.
###928 We have to carefully preserve all this stuff
###930 because-- it's a great hack, by the way.
###933 The tuning fork was a wonderful discovery back then.
###938 The fact it's been used to compromise the Constitution
###940 and prevent free speech, well, collateral damage.
###944 The other reminder is that business models-- again,
###947 like broadband, the business model
###950 came from the accidental properties of history.
###956 The single frequency single hop signal
###959 gave us the business model of radio.
###962 And if I make it to CS this year, I ask about radio,
###966 I've found Pandora is radio.
###970 Tubes and transistors are no longer radio.
###973 Beware the language.
###974 
###977 The talking telegraph really created havoc.
###982 We had this great technology.
###984 Digital can cover any distance.
###987 And then this guy across the river
###989 there disobeyed his father-in-law,
###991 stole an idea from Elisha Gray, who
###993 retired to West [INAUDIBLE], and created the talking telegraph
###998 using analog technology, and made a mess of things.
###1002 Distance now became difficult.
###1006 Distance used to be easy.
###1007 Telegraph would go over any distance.
###1009 Distance became hard.
###1012 And with that explicit understanding,
###1015 we could tune things, we could tune knobs and all this stuff.
###1019 But it was very hard to preserve a signal across the street,
###1023 let alone across the country.
###1026 So this guy Claude Shannon did a lot of research,
###1030 created this whole technology for how
###1032 to preserve a signal within wire.
###1035 Within the channel.
###1036 He didn't use the term wire.
###1038 He used a channel.
###1039 It wasn't very abstract term.
###1042 He called it information for the same reason physicists,
###1046 we'll point out, like to use words like work.
###1049 Well we have giant brains, all this notation,
###1052 anthropomorphic notation.
###1054 We use the word communicate as if these wires carried
###1058 our meaning.
###1060 And we're still living in that legacy.
###1063 
###1066 Matter of fact, here it's more than a century
###1069 after that picture I showed you of the wires
###1073 covering all the streets, yet it's even worse.
###1076 All we've done in a century and a half
###1079 is learn how to take all those wires
###1081 and bundle them up very neatly into little tiny packages.
###1085 And worse, we have multiple bundles and wires
###1088 from competing bundlers, or bunglers,
###1091 whatever you want to call them.
###1093 And it's even worse.
###1095 Inside each of those we have virtual circuits
###1097 to maintain each conversation.
###1099 
###1102 Now how you can maintain a business model of carrying bits
###1105 where there's no longer any way to compete.
###1110 In other words, they're just bits.
###1111 They're generic bits.
###1112 How you differentiate.
###1115 But the reason we have the legacy
###1116 is we're still stuck in stage two, the idea
###1119 that you need pipes, pipes, pipes.
###1122 And it comes out in many ways.
###1124 One is carriers don't want to become dumb pipes.
###1128 Sorry.
###1130 That's not the worst of it, is the fact
###1133 we don't need pipes anymore.
###1134 Bits are all self-identified, meaning
###1136 it's assembled outside the network.
###1138 We don't need pipes.
###1139 Yet our business models are still pipe-based.
###1145 Now the digital technology that gave us computers
###1147 did set the stage for the future.
###1150 But we first have to-- again, this
###1151 is why I brought up the issue of language.
###1153 How many people think physicists should run the NLRB, National
###1157 Labor Relations Board, because they understand what work is?
###1161 Why would a double E be allowed to run
###1164 a school of communications and the PR department?
###1167 Those people understand communications.
###1170 Apparently E's don't because they confuse information
###1173 in the Shannon sense.
###1175 How much information is there in not answering a question?
###1180 Or in a pause?
###1181 There are people who spend a lot of time figuring it out,
###1184 and you have to slap them and say, no.
###1184 That's a stupid question.
###1185 
###1189 Now this sets the stage for what I'm calling stage three.
###1194 Now we're very interested in [INAUDIBLE],
###1195 but I took a class in spring of 1973 from Mike Hammer.
###1200 Does anybody remember Mike Hammer, reengineering?
###1204 It was studying networks.
###1205 So one of things we studied was ALOHAnet.
###1207 
###1211 How many people here know about ALOHAnet?
###1214 OK.
###1214 It was a radio packet network in Hawaii.
###1217 Do It yourself packet network.
###1218 There had been various experiments integrating packet
###1221 networks, but I remember ALOHA was
###1223 the one we studied in class.
###1226 And basically it was what any hacker would do.
###1230 It looks at a packet and resends it.
###1231 No big deal.
###1233 Maybe it's the latest temperature.
###1234 You don't resend it.
###1235 You just give them temperature.
###1238 I mean, we called it a net.
###1239 It was ALOHAnet, but it was a network in the sense Facebook
###1244 is a network, or, sorry, Google+ is a network.
###1248 It's a social network.
###1251 That's the problem with language again.
###1253 This is why I'm so fascinated by language.
###1256 The word network is so general as to be
###1258 totally useless for communicating.
###1260 Worse than useless.
###1262 It sort of like diplomacy.
###1263 You can both use the same word, but mean
###1265 entirely different things.
###1266 But you think you're talking to each other.
###1269 And at the end of the class, some other kid sitting next
###1272 to me-- this is May 1973, did his baseband project.
###1275 He took ALOHA and put it on a coax.
###1278 Now I wanted to do it over the campus network,
###1280 it would have been broadband.
###1281 But I didn't follow through, so it doesn't count.
###1285 But it was obvious this is a great hack.
###1287 2.994 megabits, as he reminds me.
###1292 That's Bob Metcalfe, you know.
###1296 It was wonderful.
###1297 But to get his Doctorate he had to prove to the EE people
###1302 that it would perform well.
###1303 Turns out he was wrong.
###1304 It performed much better than his thesis said.
###1307 
###1311 So how many of you are familiar with the paradigms framings?
###1317 When you change a paradigm, everything changes.
###1320 So when Copernicus did his little thing
###1321 of moving a reference point 93 million miles,
###1325 it was a nice mathematical hack, and it
###1327 did make navigation easier.
###1329 But it had two side effects, which
###1331 he wouldn't have anticipated.
###1332 One, it destroyed people's idea that they
###1335 were the middle of the universe.
###1339 And that made it very hard to accept.
###1341 And I'm telling you meaning is not fundamental,
###1343 if you want a scary concept.
###1346 The other thing it did was give Newton his physics.
###1350 Because suddenly you could see a uniformity out
###1353 of all these disparate things, and you just
###1355 get a deeper understanding.
###1357 And in that sense, what the packet radios forced us to do
###1362 was learn how to preserve meaning outside of the network.
###1366 Discover what we can do with the opportunities.
###1370 And that, I argue, is the real origin of the internet.
###1374 Learning how to solve problems ourselves,
###1377 learning the techniques for using any available resource
###1380 as a way to communicate in the human sense, not just EE sense.
###1387 And that's why I say a fundamental discontinuity,
###1390 yet we're still thinking stage two because, as I said,
###1394 language, information, communications.
###1396 It just sounds just like the railroads of the 19th century.
###1399 And in fact, we have a thing called the Federal
###1402 Communications Commission.
###1405 What do they mean by communications?
###1410 What's worse is they're explicitly spun off
###1413 from the ICC, Interstate Commerce Commission, which
###1417 managed railroads.
###1419 Now that's gone.
###1420 It's been replaced by the Department of Transportation,
###1423 which manages the means we use to travel.
###1428 It does not manage the actual freight itself.
###1431 In the meantime, the FCC is there
###1433 telling us what words we're allowed to use,
###1436 how we're allowed to run elections.
###1437 Really weird.
###1440 You'd think these people didn't understand how to communicate.
###1443 And we're still compromising the First Amendment
###1445 by creating scarcity in order to keep the business alive.
###1448 So the internet happened when we're interconnected the LANs.
###1451 The LAN, you were , anywhere, plugged into the coax,
###1453 you were just there.
###1456 But the consequence of that was you
###1459 could not see beyond the individual packet.
###1463 So therefore, we had to have a system--
###1466 and this is the real insight-- to separate TCP from IP.
###1470 And it wasn't just Vince or Bob Kahn.
###1473 There were a number of others.
###1474 David Reed locally, and Dave Clark,
###1476 and all these other people.
###1478 How do you preserve an application relationship
###1483 independent, when you could just exchange nothing above packets?
###1487 
###1491 And this where the end-to-end argument.
###1492 You had to have meaning outside the application.
###1495 
###1502 The earlier slide said TCP, mentioned explicitly.
###1505 What TCP is, it says transmission control protocol.
###1510 Very interesting.
###1512 Because if all you want to do was make sure
###1517 all the bits got through, you keep
###1518 retrying til it gets through.
###1521 But TCP was also protocol for cooperatively
###1523 sharing the resources in the middle by detecting congestion,
###1527 by backing off.
###1529 And what's amazing is how well that worked.
###1532 That it's really a social protocol for sharing resources.
###1537 It's not just a reliable stream protocol.
###1540 
###1543 And basically, yes, you can violate it,
###1546 but if more than a few people violate a collapse,
###1548 you get immediate feedback, people used standard libraries.
###1550 So it's a whole interesting discussion
###1551 about why that works.
###1552 And sociologists should study this some more.
###1556 And I won't go into problems like buffer blow.
###1558 There were lots of other issues.
###1559 
###1562 So where I come into this, and this much prouder
###1565 than doing VisiCalc, was home networks.
###1567 
###1571 The original triple play plan, or n-tuple play. [INAUDIBLE]
###1575 is a good example.
###1577 They would haul a pipe into your house.
###1580 They would put an a ATM card cage in the basement.
###1584 ATM was asynchronous transfer mode.
###1586 The base for DSL.
###1588 I'll try to avoid too much acronym soup.
###1590 By the way, ADSL is interesting.
###1592 You know why DSL exists?
###1594 For interactive TV.
###1597 It was not created for the internet.
###1598 That was a later repurposing.
###1601 There's a lot of repurposing discovery.
###1603 Hindsight history makes things look so purposeful.
###1605 
###1608 People have a reason for everything.
###1611 But if you remember at the beginning
###1614 when you had to run a separate wire for reach relationship,
###1618 well those wires, virtual wires were
###1621 inside a pipe or any other triple plays.
###1624 Each phone line was delivered to the card cage.
###1627 In the early days, remember, the phone companies
###1630 owned your phone.
###1632 The service was the conversation.
###1636 It was not the wires coming into your house.
###1641 And therefore in the 1950s, AT&T had
###1644 to be sued to allow you put a box around a phone.
###1647 it was a kind of device called the Hush-A-Phone compromised
###1649 the quality of the service and dispersed their reputation.
###1653 Later the Carterfone allowed your equipment on,
###1657 but the Hush-A-Phone, I think was a more interesting case.
###1660 Where the boundary of the service is.
###1662 
###1666 And you can see the example of how that works in practice.
###1668 Carriers would want to charge for each IP address
###1671 as if it were a phone number.
###1673 You're going to pay for each IP address.
###1676 Since they looked inside your house,
###1678 they can do things like trying to ban webcams
###1681 because those were an abuse of their service.
###1683 
###1687 It really [INAUDIBLE] home.
###1689 Repurposing a video distribution service, rethink connectivity.
###1694 And today, the modern version of that is called Google Fiber.
###1696 
###1699 And Google Fiber's attitude is you can share.
###1702 They're telling you what you do with the bits.
###1704 Now what company would be so evil
###1710 AUDIENCE: Are you referring to the no servers allowed?
###1713 BOB FRANKSTON: No, that the least of it.
###1715 AUDIENCE: That is [INAUDIBLE].
###1716 BOB FRANKSTON: No I understand.
###1717 Verizon had the same attitude.
###1719 And the nice thing about terms of service--
###1721 I'll be nice to the FCC, so I won't say
###1723 fuck them-- but back when I was doing home networking--
###1727 and I'll get into that-- I basically
###1729 ignored the terms of service.
###1730 Because the phone companies said you're not
###1733 allowed to add more than one PC to your home network.
###1736 To the router.
###1737 They're going to tell you what you
###1739 can do with the device inside your own home.
###1743 AUDIENCE: So for the Google Fiber
###1744 no sharing, you mean you can't [INAUDIBLE]
###1746 community over to watch TV?
###1748 BOB FRANKSTON: No, it's not just watch TV.
###1749 If I have a Google Fiber programs,
###1751 I'm not allowed to share that connection with my neighbor.
###1754 Now I can understand the business model point
###1757 of view, which is why you need a business model that
###1759 doesn't create such terrible behavior.
###1762 But are there people who try to bring,
###1764 like housing communities.
###1765 You want to bring broadband to the poor.
###1767 You got a gigabit.
###1769 That'll serve complete apartment houses.
###1773 Steve [INAUDIBLE] here uses just a few megabits
###1776 to serve the [INAUDIBLE] project.
###1778 So that it's as if you-- yes?
###1781 AUDIENCE: Yes.
###1782 [INAUDIBLE] one gigabit.
###1784 BOB FRANKSTON: No it's not.
###1785 You play the odds.
###1786 Sure.
###1788 But let people discover what it does.
###1791 AUDIENCE: Providers tell you up front, yes,
###1793 you may have one gigabit of bandwidth,
###1795 but you only have 5%.
###1796 
###1799 BOB FRANKSTON: Yeah.
###1800 Let the people decide and discover that.
###1802 Sure.
###1803 But it's sort of like a sidewalk.
###1805 We're going to limit how many people can live in the house.
###1809 This is where you have the idea of discovering
###1811 what you can do from the edge.
###1813 
###1816 I don't want guarantees.
###1819 The reason Skype can do video is because Skype does not
###1823 promise to do video.
###1824 If they promised video, they could not do video.
###1828 There are a lot of counterintuitive aspects
###1830 here, which is why you have to start
###1831 thinking from the resource and from outside.
###1835 And you also have some interesting things,
###1837 like if you're above a threshold,
###1839 you've got 10 people with 10 connections, you get 100 times
###1843 of capacity.
###1844 But basically, if you have a lot of DSL wires, you share them,
###1850 you get disproportional improvement.
###1851 It's like a one-lane highway will get more than three
###1855 times the traffic jams of a three-lane highway.
###1858 Because you start to use the resource effectively.
###1860 You fill in the holes, you accept delays.
###1863 And it all depends on the application.
###1865 We're just extending the word Wikipedia.
###1867 Who cares?
###1868 A gigabit is wonderful.
###1869 Even if you've got a 10 megabit.
###1871 Let me share.
###1871 Let me decide.
###1873 But it affects the business model.
###1874 That's why I keep coming back to the funding model.
###1877 I'm not saying it should be given away,
###1879 we need funding models that work with societal needs.
###1883 Yes.
###1884 AUDIENCE: My one big sticky thing
###1885 here still is legal issues, including intellectual property
###1891 enforcement.
###1892 BOB FRANKSTON: No.
###1892 But that's not in the wire.
###1893 The bits are bits.
###1895 They have no inherent meaning.
###1897 This is a homeopathic theory of communications,
###1900 that bits have a memory of their original intent.
###1902 AUDIENCE: We share a network connection
###1904 that [INAUDIBLE] multi-family home.
###1907 And one person who was visiting downloaded--
###1909 BOB FRANKSTON: Yes.
###1910 And this is why lawyers are one of the greatest
###1913 threats to society.
###1914 Basically, you should move the trial
###1917 to Salem, which is the appropriate venue
###1919 for such theories.
###1921 AUDIENCE: My point is, we do need, as a society, to--
###1924 BOB FRANKSTON: No.
###1926 We have to come to the 20th century, let alone the 21st.
###1930 AUDIENCE: But isn't the fundamental problem referring
###1932 to the fact that you're trying to share the resource that
###1937 has a huge level of [INAUDIBLE]?
###1940 BOB FRANKSTON: OK.
###1940 
###1942 Let me get through this and I'll get to this other.
###1944 The short answer is we're using 0% of the available capacity.
###1949 So before you start telling me about a shortage,
###1951 start telling me where that shortage is.
###1954 When I've got three broadbands coming through my backyard
###1957 and 1% of any one of them is my full internet connection,
###1961 I've already got 100,000 times the capacity.
###1964 So what do you mean?
###1965 Why do you tell me shortage?
###1967 Where's the shortage?
###1968 When the police will run a fiber to their gun detection
###1973 sound thing, which only a few kilobits you need for gunshot,
###1977 but deny anybody the ability to share that.
###1980 People now run fibers to fire alarms and things.
###1984 That are terabits of capacity going unused.
###1986 So before you run about scarcity,
###1988 show me there's a problem.
###1989 
###1992 And the other example I won't get into is meter reading.
###1995 Now meter bits are special.
###1997 They can't go over the real internet.
###1999 They need their own network so the phone companies
###2002 can go back to triple-play and collect money
###2005 for each meter read.
###2006 And if you read the IEEE numbers about how many gigabits
###2009 of capacity and everything they need to read the meter,
###2012 they need a whole fiber infrastructure,
###2014 gigabits capacity.
###2016 Though if you run the numbers, you'll find out
###2018 it's less than a bit per second.
###2020 But you need fiber.
###2022 We're really beholden to all these myths.
###2025 So we need to start from the edge.
###2027 And the other important point is local connectivity
###2030 is more important than distant connectivity.
###2033 We became fixated on long distance.
###2035 Anybody old enough to remember when long distance would
###2038 put fear in your hearts you'd go bankrupt on a long distance
###2041 call?
###2042 That's because of the stupid thing with analog telephony
###2046 that Al Bell did.
###2049 With digital it's no longer an issue.
###2051 And even more important, the people we know and stuff
###2053 are nearby.
###2055 I was reminded of this.
###2056 We're so hung up on social media, the network.
###2059 My son last night was caught-- foolishly
###2061 decided to take a long drive to Phoenix.
###2065 And he was going to go from Indianapolis,
###2067 or he was going from Indianapolis to St. Louis.
###2071 It turns out that outside Terra Haute,
###2074 traffic was stopped for 12 hours in the middle of the snow.
###2079 Online social media is no information.
###2082 If he had CB radio with him, and they almost took one,
###2086 he could've found out from the truckers and everybody what
###2088 was happening locally.
###2089 
###2092 And so you can get across the country easily
###2097 to get to a website, but you can't
###2100 send a message from your light switch to the light fixture,
###2103 because that's still using technology
###2106 Ben Franklin understood.
###2108 
###2111 We have TV controllers.
###2113 There are so many problems with you
###2115 have to be on the right LAN, you've
###2117 got to point the IR at the right device.
###2119 We do all this work at a distance,
###2121 yet we don't realize it starts locally.
###2124 And then interconnect these local islands
###2127 is how the internet happened.
###2129 And that's important lesson I built on.
###2132 Actually, we're going to finish.
###2134 So what I did with home networking is I made it opaque.
###2138 I was at Microsoft at the time.
###2140 Basically I prototyped it at my house.
###2141 I did it for myself.
###2143 And I try to do things that are generalized.
###2144 When Dan Bricklin did a spreadsheet
###2146 so he could do his homework, we just
###2148 did a general version of it.
###2149 
###2153 So the NAT is a nice hack.
###2155 So people couldn't peek inside your house.
###2157 They couldn't enforce the terms of service.
###2159 You could share all you want.
###2161 On occasion they'll try to tell you, and the problem is yeah,
###2163 some people look at the IP address
###2165 and all sorts of how bad ideas.
###2169 Accuse you of being a witch because your bits
###2170 don't look right.
###2173 But the key is to make it just so you can give people
###2175 the tools to use the resources available.
###2178 How many people worry about how many gigabits of video
###2181 they're showing within their home?
###2185 There's no cost.
###2186 It suddenly becomes expensive once you get outside the home.
###2190 So the benefits to the ownership is you get as many IP devices
###2192 as you want.
###2193 There's not scarcity of IP addresses, no meter running.
###2198 And right now we ca run gigabits in the home.
###2200 Remember it used to be ten megabits was very expensive.
###2203 Modems used to be $300 for kilobits.
###2206 But we're not quite there.
###2207 We still have this perimeter security, these complex rules.
###2210 Instead of abstracting security, making the application.
###2213 We still think it's a property of the network.
###2215 And these all long discussions in their own right.
###2218 And we still don't understand generic bits.
###2221 We have USB, we have SATA we have FireWire, we have HDMI.
###2225 All these special packets, as if they're are all
###2228 so special and different.
###2231 I did this display port here because that's really
###2233 an application protocol which we should be pushing,
###2235 but instead we're stuck with HDMI,
###2237 which is equivalent to the old digital telephone.
###2240 Sort of faux digital.
###2243 So with home control we can learn by doing.
###2247 But people still think it's special
###2251 because it's within a home.
###2253 It's behind a NAT.
###2255 When it's really just the example of a do it yourself
###2260 environment.
###2262 We have discovered, for example, want
###2264 to solve a problem connecting devices?
###2267 One thing from the edge is, v6 is a dead issue at this point.
###2272 Instead we use v4 reflected to the cloud.
###2275 Which I think is a terrible idea, but it works.
###2278 It's an example of you go with what works.
###2280 
###2282 But I won't dwell on that either.
###2284 Another topic.
###2287 But we still use wires to define relationships.
###2288 So how do we move beyond the home?
###2291 
###2293 The answer's very simple.
###2295 We do what we did with the original internet.
###2296 
###2298 We basically interconnect this islands.
###2300 We've already tunneled between the islands.
###2302 When you get a quote, "broadband connection",
###2305 you're really tunneling out of your home through telecom.
###2309 They own the other end of the tunnel,
###2310 but that's a temporary historical accident.
###2312 We won't go into why it happened.
###2314 But we can take the same ownership perimeter
###2317 and expand it out from your home.
###2320 So if you and your neighbors share,
###2321 which some people are already doing, an apartment house,
###2325 you can get many benefits.
###2327 To get two major benefits.
###2329 One is cost savings.
###2330 You share the capacity.
###2332 But the other thing is you can get permissionless ambient
###2335 connectivity.
###2336 You can now do all those IP-based devices.
###2339 You can buy some now, but the problem with perimeter security
###2342 makes them very brittle and fragile.
###2345 AUDIENCE: It depends on what the perimeter is.
###2347 In our building we run our own services.
###2350 BOB FRANKSTON: Yeah, But do you have
###2353 a WEP or other authentication?
###2354 
###2357 AUDIENCE: It's been years since I
###2359 was using any of those services.
###2360 BOB FRANKSTON: No, but the answers is--
###2361 AUDIENCE: A server you can [INAUDIBLE].
###2363 BOB FRANKSTON: Right.
###2364 You have that, but what you want to do
###2366 is at least be able to have devices just connect.
###2368 I'm glad to see Google does not have an agree screen.
###2372 But the problem is you get things like this at Jet Blue.
###2377 Now can somebody explain why first I
###2380 have to call my lawyer before I can call my lawyer?
###2383 
###2386 There's something wrong there.
###2388 I've already the airline terminal.
###2389 I've already agreed to much worse things they could do me,
###2393 yet they have me type agree.
###2395 This is something everybody should
###2397 do what they can to get rid of those.
###2399 
###2402 And again, if you ask people fear,
###2404 they'll say child pornography.
###2405 
###2408 They don't have any better idea, it's
###2409 just they've learned this mantra.
###2412 But if we paid for infrastructure
###2414 like we do roads and sidewalks, we
###2415 wouldn't have a need to shut things down just for revenue.
###2418 AUDIENCE: Will you accept, especially
###2420 in neighborhoods like where my house is, that there
###2423 are thieves, drug dealers, all sorts of criminals using
###2427 those public rights of way to get by with no record
###2430 that they passed because--
###2432 BOB FRANKSTON: You mean you let people walk by your house
###2435 without signing an agreement?
###2437 And without paying you?
###2439 AUDIENCE: Yeah.
###2439 Well the ping is a totally different issue.
###2441 BOB FRANKSTON: Well ask Rand Paul.
###2443 He'd demand--
###2444 AUDIENCE: You have a very different expectation
###2446 of how freely usable for potentially illegal activities
###2450 a sidewalk is, compared to--
###2452 
###2456 BOB FRANKSTON: And this is what's amazing.
###2457 We're lucky by accident in the Constitution days
###2461 when people were really pissed off at the king,
###2463 so they wrote the free speech thing in.
###2465 But every opportunity since, the fear is so-- it's spelled NSA.
###2473 And yes, it's amazing how people fear
###2480 what they don't understand yet.
###2481 Which means you're not going to get any discontinuities,
###2483 and you're not going to get any surprises.
###2485 Yes.
###2486 But an important part of the whole lecture,
###2489 why the First Amendment works.
###2492 Why things work despite the fact that crossing a street
###2496 is too dangerous to do.
###2498 
###2502 So if we fund the infrastructure-- again,
###2505 as I keep saying-- as you do sidewalks, these problems go.
###2508 The reason for putting up a wall, putting fear aside,
###2512 financial reasons go away.
###2513 Because it's so cheap, you pay for it once
###2516 like a home network.
###2517 And then you create opportunity to discover [INAUDIBLE].
###2520 We haven't even started to explore what we can do.
###2524 Because we can do high value applications.
###2526 Like at home control.
###2527 
###2534 I don't know where my slide is, but home control
###2536 is a wonderful example, because we just
###2539 start to discover what we can do with connectivity.
###2542 But one of the lessons I learned to total control
###2545 is that we could do high value applications.
###2547 We call them trophy homes.
###2549 There are lighting scenarios, all these
###2551 complicated high value stories.
###2553 TVs coming down, the shades, all this stuff.
###2556 We can't do light switches.
###2558 OK?
###2559 That's the problem here.
###2561 Without permissionless ambient connectivity,
###2563 simple things become hard.
###2564 It's not just permissionless.
###2566 The DNS, the current-- you must ask ICANN for permission.
###2570 There are lots of other problems,
###2571 but if we solve the financial problems,
###2574 we then have an incentive to solve problems.
###2576 We introduce resilience to the edge.
###2577 You connect through an access point.
###2580 You're walking down the street, you've
###2581 got Comcast and all these others connected to,
###2584 and then Google Maps stops working.
###2586 Because one access point got stuck.
###2588 Authentication chain, somebody broke it.
###2590 The protocols of the edge aren't resilient.
###2593 So there's a lot of work to do better protocols
###2596 and have resilience of the whole network.
###2598 Not meshy, necessarily.
###2599 That's just technology.
###2600 But resilience.
###2601 So the old model, we assume value
###2604 is created inside the network.
###2607 Thus we could fund the network out of the revenue.
###2610 And that's where the cable TV companies are.
###2613 They own the pipes, they sell resources,
###2615 just like railroads sold rides.
###2618 If you go to Netflix that collapses,
###2620 which creates the conflict.
###2621 Fortunately there's a new business model,
###2624 which is the one I keep saying.
###2626 Just pay for the wires.
###2627 They're so cheap.
###2628 You put them in once.
###2630 It's amazing how inexpensive.
###2632 And if we didn't put the fiber in,
###2636 we would have been doing gigabits over copper.
###2638 DSL was running megabits 25 years ago.
###2642 Now it's copper, right, so not pairs.
###2644 You don't follow DSL rules.
###2647 You be very innovative, you do the bundles as a whole.
###2649 And at this point, one way to use copper is to sell it.
###2655 Less copper and buy fiber.
###2656 I don't care.
###2658 I'm just saying the economics is what drives Moore's law.
###2662 And then we won't have the need to exclude people for no reason
###2666 other than forcing people to pay.
###2669 Imagine sidewalks, the paywall around them.
###2671 
###2673 To show you the value of this, let's look at a case study.
###2676 Philips Lifeline is one of the local companies there now
###2679 in Framingham.
###2680 They started locally.
###2682 And initially they just had the radio
###2686 from the device going to a phone and it would dial up.
###2690 It worked well enough for the purpose.
###2692 Hopefully the phone line was not in use,
###2694 and all the other things.
###2695 But they put it before, and you can
###2696 get it to work enough times to be useful.
###2699 Now people are going to the next stage, which they carefully
###2703 set up connections to cell phone.
###2705 If you set up the Bluetooth right and use the right
###2707 phone, and you've paid your bill, and the matter of--
###2710 and you [MUMBLING].
###2712 It can work.
###2715 But the problem without permissionless ambient
###2717 connectivity is the default is failure.
###2722 Shouldn't the default be to just work?
###2725 And that's really what I'm getting to.
###2727 The idea that we want just works connectivity.
###2729 Now there are no guarantees, and this
###2730 is why the VoIP story is important.
###2732 Because we can get voice to work.
###2734 It turns out Skype works much better over lines
###2737 that the traditional phone companies can't
###2739 use because their protocols are all
###2741 brittly dependent upon the network doing everything right,
###2744 preserving a path.
###2745 Turns out cleverness can make up for a lot.
###2749 So this is why so important are the incentives
###2751 and create opportunities.
###2752 
###2755 And then there's a whole discussion, which
###2757 I won't get into, is then we can start
###2759 rethinking the current internet.
###2760 For example, the Post Office, I understand,
###2762 is routing far better than any of the internet people.
###2765 Because it try to send mail to you.
###2766 It sends mail to a place.
###2767 That's its job.
###2769 You tell your friends where you are.
###2770 
###2774 So I can go through, if anybody wants to,
###2776 the other big topic we could do is where are the smarts.
###2779 Smarts are valuable.
###2781 So people want to own the smarts.
###2783 But if you go into a restaurant, you
###2784 don't want your wait person knowing
###2787 what you're going to eat.
###2788 You'd like to have some say in the matter.
###2792 So I won't go into the challenges,
###2795 but obviously there's a telecom industry which exists
###2799 and to rightfully sees this as a deadly threat.
###2802 We have an FCC, which is trying to transition to IP, as
###2806 if they're desperate attempt to keep us in stage two.
###2810 By simply saying IP is the new phone wire,
###2813 but everything else is the same.
###2815 You don't transition.
###2817 You let the whole thing fade into the sunset.
###2819 At some point nobody's going to care about it.
###2822 You resell the facilities.
###2824 And want does one do with lead acid batteries?
###2827 How do you decommission them?
###2828 There might be a lot of money.
###2829 Somebody find a good use for lead acid batteries.
###2832 You'd make a lot of money.
###2835 AUDIENCE: They recycle them, I thought.
###2837 BOB FRANKSTON: As what?
###2837 Maybe they do, but I'm just saying.
###2839 The whole internet thing is just in the infancy.
###2843 Everything I read about it is very special hacks.
###2846 There's no general connectivity.
###2847 But then again, these long discussions-- I
###2849 just wanted to introduce these as ideas at this point.
###2854 I can also, if you want, go to the other slide,
###2856 which I'm proud of, is how do we run out of the internet
###2858 when it's just a technique?
###2860 After hacking at night here, went to Union Square
###2865 for French toast.
###2867 And I was told we're out of a French toast.
###2871 
###2874 We asked, said are you out of bread, milk too?
###2876 He said the guy didn't know how to make it.
###2878 And that's really those wires are,
###2880 is running out of internet.
###2881 So any questions?
###2883 Anybody confused?
###2884 Anybody awake?
###2884 
###2888 AUDIENCE: So what happens to your do it yourself
###2891 home small community network when it breaks?
###2895 BOB FRANKSTON: What happens if your water pipe breaks?
###2899 AUDIENCE: Well, I get it serviced.
###2900 BOB FRANKSTON: Yeah.
###2901 So we'll have the new plumbers.
###2902 And in fact, I'm actually trying to find
###2904 people who want to start.
###2905 In other words, the point I'm making
###2907 is I'm actually in favor of business, capitalists,
###2909 and all this.
###2910 It's just you've got to have rational businesses,
###2913 and the model changes.
###2915 If you want to read a book "Railroaded", by Richard White.
###2921 It's a wonderful story because it
###2922 tells how the railroads in the West-- this is opposed
###2925 to the ones in the East, which have different densities--
###2928 were never financially viable.
###2930 That's why you've got the FCC.
###2933 Or subways in New York were never viable.
###2935 Each infrastructure, you have to look at how these centers work,
###2940 what's the business model?
###2941 Instead of just continuing forward.
###2943 So yes, if we're viewing a time and materials
###2945 model as a business, we need plumbers.
###2948 Of course they're a time and material business.
###2950 Your plumber does not charge you for the cost of water
###2954 at the price of whisky.
###2956 When you buy flour you don't pay for the cake.
###2960 So you have to understand where the values is added.
###2962 Question back there?
###2963 
###2966 The first step, one thing to do, and people are already
###2968 doing it, the first step is education and understanding.
###2973 But if you're in an apartment house,
###2975 get your friends and neighbors to basically make
###2977 that a connected zone.
###2979 Because petitioning the city is hard,
###2981 because there's too much education, the language,
###2983 everything makes it very hard.
###2984 How can you even talk about the FCC
###2987 when they were created to keep a business model alive?
###2992 They're not a technology They were designed
###2995 as part of a deal with AT&T to make
###2998 AT&T viable as the stewards of our ability to communicate.
###3003 Things have sort of gotten out of whack.
###3006 And they also got a right to do it
###3007 based on spectrum allocation.
###3010 But you understand how hard it is
###3011 to get people to think differently,
###3013 but if you change economics, if your building--
###3016 and there are a million buildings-- so
###3017 if you start to get your building
###3019 to be a connected zone, and work out from there,
###3021 repeating the history of the internet,
###3023 you start to get to an alternative which is viable.
###3026 
###3029 And I think that's the starting.
###3033 AUDIENCE: When you start to get, having been involved
###3037 in small building connectivity zone
###3039 efforts over a couple of decades, problems you have
###3042 is still, as far as I know, too much expertise.
###3045 BOB FRANKSTON: Yeah.
###3046 If you want a problem, it's really
###3048 a problem in California, the Bay Area.
###3050 Too many people who understand too much.
###3052 That's my parallel to put in fiber, ripped out fiber.
###3056 So yes.
###3057 It's a matter of venue shopping and set example.
###3061 AUDIENCE: But more than this, plumbing isn't a simple thing.
###3064 But plumbing was simplified so that it could become a trade.
###3067 And by having it established as a trade,
###3070 regular people can become people that maintain plumbing.
###3072 You need that for networking.
###3074 BOB FRANKSTON: Well actually, remember,
###3075 I did that already for home networks.
###3076 
###3079 When I first started doing home networking
###3080 in '95, think of the reaction I got
###3083 when I said people are going to maintain their own home
###3085 networks.
###3088 So I did a couple things.
###3089 First thing, remember I had this position having been in a class
###3094 where we were doing this stuff.
###3095 So I knew there was nothing hard there.
###3097 Nothing secret.
###3098 I just had to remove all the things that
###3099 made it hard like configuring IP addresses and things like that.
###3104 I've learned a lot since.
###3105 There's a lot of ways they can make it even simpler.
###3107 So yes.
###3108 Part of it is this is why I talk about the connectivity of net
###3112 routing I compare with crossing a river by jumping on icebergs.
###3117 Turns out we have bridges.
###3119 Just use the bridges.
###3120 It's like the Post Office delivers to addresses.
###3122 So insights like that make things much simpler.
###3125 All hubs and routers should be self-diagnosing.
###3129 But until we have a market incentive to do this,
###3132 it's going to be hard to make that happen.
###3134 Unfortunately, I was at Microsoft.
###3137 I was able to keep them, and I purposely
###3139 made sure they had no way to monetize it.
###3143 To control it.
###3145 But they did get value out of the connectivity.
###3147 Just like Google has a value out of connectivity.
###3149 The more people can connect-- even if 99% of the traffic
###3153 is local, you can still start to offer all these new services
###3157 and these new innovations.
###3159 But I am actively looking for people
###3160 to work with who do want to do business in both educating
###3164 people on how to do it themselves
###3166 and providing the appropriate expertise.
###3169 So yes.
###3171 I don't expect most people to want to do their own networking
###3173 or build their own networks, but there's no reason
###3178 that it has to be hard.
###3180 We're just used to it.
###3181 The same as DNS.
###3182 We have this whole legacy because so much
###3184 of today's internet goes back to the mainframe
###3187 days, port numbers, all these issues, which are legacies.
###3193 We've learned a lot since we first did the current internet.
###3199 Yes.
###3200 AUDIENCE: So, to [INAUDIBLE] idea
###3202 up, you just have to make it easier.
###3203 But you mentioned a problem being firewalls and such.
###3207 BOB FRANKSTON: Yes.
###3209 AUDIENCE: One of the [INAUDIBLE] benefits of that is I
###3214 think at one time if you put a Windows computer
###3217 on the public [INAUDIBLE], it would compromise in 10 minutes.
###3220 Definitely less [INAUDIBLE].
###3223 BOB FRANKSTON: Yes.
###3223 And when I first did it, what I was saying is OK,
###3227 v4 closed the ports by default.
###3230 But IPv6 or IPsec, we wouldn't be stupid.
###3237 We designed it to be aware.
###3239 Now it turns out we're still stupid,
###3241 but that's another issue.
###3243 But we can't depend upon permanent security.
###3245 So now anybody know the Maginot Line in France?
###3251 And how how well it worked for them.
###3254 Now it turns out Andre Maginot actually was not stupid.
###3257 He knew you still needed an army.
###3260 But he made a mistake.
###3261 He died.
###3263 And the politicians then said, army?
###3265 We don't need no army.
###3266 We've got a wall.
###3268 So people are building in these hyper things.
###3270 But look at Google's problem.
###3273 Chromecast is on the wrong network.
###3274 The device doesn't work.
###3278 So the answer is yes.
###3280 We have to first have a better security model.
###3283 Because when you go to Starbucks that same machine
###3285 gets connected.
###3287 That's based at the application level,
###3290 the software level doesn't depend on the firewall.
###3293 In my model, even if you have permissionless security,
###3296 you still can have legacy stuff protected.
###3298 So I'm not saying we get rid of all that.
###3301 I'm looking new opportunities.
###3302 
###3305 AUDIENCE: One of the big incentives
###3306 to have an apartment network, basically.
###3309 A small community network when I was
###3313 having a college-ish lifestyle, was
###3315 that we could have our server serving the copies of our CDs
###3320 to us [INAUDIBLE].
###3322 Now that isn't done anymore.
###3323 Maybe it's done centrally.
###3325 Do you see obvious ways that Google
###3328 could enable that sort of community hub
###3331 when we're otherwise serving.
###3336 BOB FRANKSTON: It's interesting.
###3337 One of the things that Western Digital is selling
###3339 is a personal cloud, which is basically
###3341 a disk in your house as a server, Pogoplug.
###3343 A lot of people doing it, so I can easily see products.
###3346 Because if you want to watch multi-screen 3D
###3352 ultra high definition video, it would be nice to cache
###3356 on a server right in the building.
###3360 It's interesting.
###3361 This is sort of a Maraschino cherry problem.
###3363 Maraschino is you take a cherry, take all the cherry-ness out
###3366 of it, then add it back.
###3369 And in a sense, we've done such a good job of conquering
###3371 distance, we have to put locality back in.
###3375 But that's pragmatic.
###3376 I mean, there are two reasons to [INAUDIBLE].
###3377 One is performance.
###3378 And fine, put a cache server there.
###3380 You can put that in a box.
###3383 Chrome PCs should be able to work with local cache as well
###3387 as remote.
###3388 By the way, a little footnote.
###3389 Be careful about the word cache.
###3391 Sometimes you'll explicitly put it there.
###3393 You want to make sure this information is there in case
###3396 you get disconnected versus just for performance.
###3399 You've got multiple issues.
###3401 So you can easily have protocols that
###3403 allow peer sharing locally.
###3404 This is content-centeric networking.
###3407 So lots of reasons for doing it.
###3408 But you also want your thermostat, your other devices,
###3412 to work within your house when your connection further out
###3416 goes down.
###3417 So we have to understand that the relationships are
###3420 separate geographically.
###3422 So there are reasons for having geographic proximity.
###3425 Sometimes I want a light switch to say turn
###3427 on the light in this room.
###3429 And you might use techniques like IR not for the message,
###3432 not for sending a message, just so you
###3434 know what room you're in.
###3437 Again, that's why I'm saying we have
###3439 to rethink a lot of what the internet is as opportunity.
###3443 And the distance stuff, yeah it's nice,
###3445 but we forgot there's a physical world there.
###3448 CB radios, we need to do virtual CB radios.
###3451 So next my son is stuck on I-70 outside of Terra Haute,
###3457 the truckers and stuff have a local social network, not just
###3461 CB radios.
###3462 Though it's probably nice that nobody else
###3464 has CB radios anymore, knowing them.
###3467 AUDIENCE: You made a comment at the beginning about something
###3470 like most [INAUDIBLE] involved in sharing.
###3474 BOB FRANKSTON: Well, we don't exchange content.
###3477 We exchange references.
###3478 Is that what you're saying?
###3480 AUDIENCE: I don't know.
###3481 I was trying to--
###3482 BOB FRANKSTON: When I say Wikipedia instead of giving you
###3483 a copy of Wikipedia?
###3484 AUDIENCE: Right.
###3484 BOB FRANKSTON: Yes.
###3486 You want me to expand on that?
###3487 That's a very interesting topic.
###3489 Because I used to give my talks and ask people
###3492 how much do we compress the Encyclopedia Britannica?
###3496 And I say to an ISBN number.
###3498 And if you're a communication theorist,
###3502 you want to fit it into the old model,
###3503 you say, well the ISBN is a dictionary
###3506 just like any of the coding we use is a dictionary.
###3510 But remember, in communication theory,
###3512 you have out-of-band signalling.
###3513 You have an out-of-band clock, which enables a three kilohertz
###3516 line to carry more than three kilohertz because
###3518 of precise timing.
###3520 But then I decided that's nonsense.
###3522 it's too hard.
###3522 It's really that we're just making references to things.
###3527 And really that's what language is.
###3530 You send URLs.
###3531 Now URLs have URL problems.
###3535 And then, so your effective capacity is meaningless.
###3538 This is why clocking the number of bits of value is bad enough.
###3542 It's already inversed.
###3543 The longer the movie, the less valuable each bit is.
###3547 But you can't even measure.
###3549 Same movie can be a terabit or it
###3552 can be ten bits depending on whether you just
###3555 need a reference or you need a copy.
###3556 
###3559 My mother wanted to send a toy to her grandson in Seattle
###3565 from New York.
###3566 I said, fine.
###3567 I'll have it there in an hour.
###3569 I returned it to Radio Shack, gave my brother the number,
###3572 and he bought it for him.
###3573 
###3577 AUDIENCE: The bit usage, bit used driver
###3582 has been people watching movies and such.
###3585 BOB FRANKSTON: It actually turns our that's not that big.
###3587 That's what Akamai is about.
###3589 They're cached locally.
###3590 There are two ways it's not a big thing.
###3592 Number one, it's cached locally.
###3593 Number two, Netflix does the compression
###3596 that the originally DSL people only envy.
###3598 So at two megabits, they can give you a high definition
###3601 experience.
###3603 You don't really care [INAUDIBLE] picture.
###3604 You want to enjoy the movie.
###3607 A cute idea would be to put a camera on,
###3609 and if you're enough feet away from the TV,
###3611 they'll de-res it because you're not
###3612 going to see the extras reses.
###3614 When you come closer-- the point is there are no rules here.
###3618 AUDIENCE: But my point about that
###3620 is that is a lot of what people consume from an ISP.
###3624 BOB FRANKSTON: Well, consume is an interesting word,
###3626 but we'll put that aside.
###3627 Yes.
###3628 AUDIENCE: A lot of how they're sending bits or receiving bits.
###3633 What we've found with the service I work on
###3636 is that if you call something caching rather than keeping
###3639 a copy, then the content owners are much more
###3643 willing to allow you to have a copy on the client side.
###3646 Therefore, community networks that
###3648 merely cache the video in ways that the [INAUDIBLE].
###3652 BOB FRANKSTON: Yes.
###3654 Our language, our legal system.
###3655 Well, our legal system is still in the 13th century.
###3659 Instead of science, which tests ideas,
###3661 our legal system proves things by example.
###3665 Not that I have anything against lawyers,
###3667 but I have something against lawyers.
###3670 OK.
###3671 MALE SPEAKER: Thank you very much.
###3673
