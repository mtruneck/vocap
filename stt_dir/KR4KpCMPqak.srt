I produce The Cute Show.

TAKAKO: Hi, hello, welcome.


4
0:0:9,33 --> 0:0:11,94
ALICE: We went to Japan to meet
Takako of Cat Prin, the


5
0:0:11,94 --> 0:0:13,86
world's premier feline
cat tailor.


6
0:0:13,86 --> 0:0:17,52
Takako was sick some
years ago.


7
0:0:17,52 --> 0:0:20,67
And she all of a sudden said
that one day she had this


8
0:0:20,67 --> 0:0:23,95
dream where God came down and
told her, you need to make


9
0:0:23,95 --> 0:0:24,86
clothes for cats.


10
0:0:24,86 --> 0:0:26,83
And that's what she
did, and it became


11
0:0:26,83 --> 0:0:28,25
hugely popular in Japan.


12
0:0:28,25 --> 0:0:30,99
She spends all day designing cat
clothes, and she dresses


13
0:0:30,99 --> 0:0:31,79
up her cats.


14
0:0:31,79 --> 0:0:34,26
We decided to put out a book
of her creations called


15
0:0:34,26 --> 0:0:36,19
Fashion Cats, it came
out last year.


16
0:0:36,19 --> 0:0:37,7
Check it out under the
description below.


17
0:0:37,7 --> 0:0:39,46
And now here it is,
The Cute Show.
