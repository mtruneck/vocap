probably the space.

Underneath that one.

SEAN MALTO: Honestly, everyone
trips on Eric.


6
0:0:10,59 --> 0:0:13,82
It's funny, because Rick Howard
trips on Eric probably


7
0:0:13,82 --> 0:0:16,43
just as much Stevie
Perez does, still.


8
0:0:16,43 --> 0:0:19,376
He's just talented.

MIKE CARROLL: He's
like, one of the


10
0:0:20,3 --> 0:0:21,45
greats, and it's longevity.


11
0:0:21,45 --> 0:0:24,39
It's not like this one dude
who's fucking doing really


12
0:0:24,39 --> 0:0:26,94
good for these last
three years.


13
0:0:26,94 --> 0:0:30,3
He's been sick for 21
years or something.


14
0:0:30,3 --> 0:0:31,21
He's just Koston.

[SKATEBOARDING SOUNDS]

0:0:36,47 --> 0:0:36,91
PATRICK O'DELL: What's up.


17
0:0:36,91 --> 0:0:39,58
Welcome back to Epicly
Later'd.


18
0:0:39,58 --> 0:0:43,43
This series we're beginning
is about Eric Koston.


19
0:0:43,43 --> 0:0:45,52
I think when you take a look
at the all-time greats in


20
0:0:45,52 --> 0:0:48,85
skateboarding, there's
definitely Tony Hawk, Mark


21
0:0:48,85 --> 0:0:53,63
Gonzales, Danny Way, Rodney
Mullen, Andrew Reynolds, and


22
0:0:53,63 --> 0:0:56,78
right up there is also
Eric Koston.


23
0:0:56,78 --> 0:1:0,21
It's undeniable that through the
last couple decades, he's


24
0:1:0,21 --> 0:1:3,2
been far and above one of
the best skaters around.


25
0:1:3,2 --> 0:1:5,3
Filmed some really
amazing parts.


26
0:1:5,3 --> 0:1:10,0
And he's always not only ahead,
but ahead on skating


27
0:1:10,0 --> 0:1:15,26
gaps, on hand rails,
and perfect style.


28
0:1:15,26 --> 0:1:18,43
Just one of those unbeatable
skaters that everyone looks to


29
0:1:18,43 --> 0:1:21,4
as one of the best street
skaters of all time.


30
0:1:21,4 --> 0:1:23,36
And I'm super stoked
he's on the show.


31
0:1:23,36 --> 0:1:25,16
It's kind of interesting, I
interviewed Meza, and at the


32
0:1:25,16 --> 0:1:27,17
end of the interview, he was
like, you don't really know


33
0:1:27,17 --> 0:1:29,49
much about Koston, do you?


34
0:1:29,49 --> 0:1:31,25
And I realized, I kind
of didn't, other


35
0:1:31,25 --> 0:1:33,56
than his skate tricks.


36
0:1:33,56 --> 0:1:34,444
ERIC KOSTON: You
son of a bitch!


37
0:1:34,444 --> 0:1:35,77
You're a fucking
son of a bitch!


38
0:1:35,77 --> 0:1:37,61
PATRICK O'DELL: We get glimpses
at who Koston is, but


39
0:1:37,61 --> 0:1:38,25
it's kind of tough.


40
0:1:38,25 --> 0:1:40,54
It's like kind of an enigma
a little bit.


41
0:1:40,54 --> 0:1:42,18
So we're going to go
over to his house.


42
0:1:42,18 --> 0:1:44,14
We're going to go to
Girl Skateboards.


43
0:1:44,14 --> 0:1:47,23
We're going to find some
people from his past.


44
0:1:47,23 --> 0:1:50,5
The next couple of weeks, it's
all about Koston, one of the


45
0:1:50,5 --> 0:1:52,64
best skaters of all time.


46
0:1:52,64 --> 0:1:53,53
And I'm super stoked.


47
0:1:53,53 --> 0:1:54,78
I hope you enjoy it.

how she rides it.


50
0:1:59,38 --> 0:2:1,29
That's how I learned how to
ride a skateboard too.

0:2:6,14 --> 0:2:7,14
ERIC KOSTON: It doesn't
have brakes.


54
0:2:7,14 --> 0:2:8,4
No, it does not have brakes.


55
0:2:8,4 --> 0:2:9,96
FEMALE SPEAKER: No, it tips.


56
0:2:9,96 --> 0:2:10,65
ERIC KOSTON: It tips.


57
0:2:10,65 --> 0:2:11,9
It's very tipsy.


58
0:2:11,9 --> 0:2:14,4

0:2:14,4 --> 0:2:15,45
That's me.


60
0:2:15,45 --> 0:2:16,85
PATRICK O'DELL: Which one?


61
0:2:16,85 --> 0:2:18,17
ERIC KOSTON: That's
me as a baby.


62
0:2:18,17 --> 0:2:19,91
PATRICK O'DELL: So you were
born in Thailand?


63
0:2:19,91 --> 0:2:20,23
ERIC KOSTON: Yeah.


64
0:2:20,23 --> 0:2:22,15
I was born in Bangkok.


65
0:2:22,15 --> 0:2:23,42
My dad, he's American.


66
0:2:23,42 --> 0:2:25,34
He was in the Air Force.


67
0:2:25,34 --> 0:2:29,505
And then he met my
mom in Thailand.


68
0:2:29,505 --> 0:2:31,67
He was stationed there, and
then eight or nine months


69
0:2:31,67 --> 0:2:33,3
after that, we moved
back here.


70
0:2:33,3 --> 0:2:35,72
I grew up in San Bernardino
because that's where the Air


71
0:2:35,72 --> 0:2:37,12
Force Base was.


72
0:2:37,12 --> 0:2:39,47
They got a divorce
pretty young.


73
0:2:39,47 --> 0:2:42,645
And so that's the only place
she really knew.


74
0:2:42,645 --> 0:2:44,58
TIM GAVIN: You know Eric's
from San Bernardino.


75
0:2:44,58 --> 0:2:48,2
And San Bernardino's basically
just east of hell.


76
0:2:48,2 --> 0:2:50,93
I think his dad split and he had
a step-dad or something.


77
0:2:50,93 --> 0:2:52,62
And it was pretty
much the exact


78
0:2:52,62 --> 0:2:54,54
scenario that I was living.


79
0:2:54,54 --> 0:2:57,51
So that was another
connection we had.


80
0:2:57,51 --> 0:2:59,66
ERIC KOSTON: This
is a good one.


81
0:2:59,66 --> 0:3:1,59
Beautiful hair, look at that.


82
0:3:1,59 --> 0:3:3,595
I could grow that
back out, too.


83
0:3:3,595 --> 0:3:6,71
I was 12 there, wearing this
Lance Mountain shirt.


84
0:3:6,71 --> 0:3:8,52
I got into skating because
of my older brother.


85
0:3:8,52 --> 0:3:10,95
It was the mid '80s, and so
he was super into it.


86
0:3:10,95 --> 0:3:13,39
It was '85, '86.


87
0:3:13,39 --> 0:3:15,64
First board was a Gonz.


88
0:3:15,64 --> 0:3:16,87
The one Gonz with the face.


89
0:3:16,87 --> 0:3:18,94
Tail was already pretty
worn out.


90
0:3:18,94 --> 0:3:20,79
It was like a hand-me-down.


91
0:3:20,79 --> 0:3:24,56
Because my mom was like-- they
were not buying new shit.


92
0:3:24,56 --> 0:3:27,64
I remember I used to push
around on my knee.


93
0:3:27,64 --> 0:3:30,16
I remember somebody telling me
some horror story of somebody


94
0:3:30,16 --> 0:3:31,94
else doing it and hitting
a crack and


95
0:3:31,94 --> 0:3:33,28
smashing their teeth out.


96
0:3:33,28 --> 0:3:36,55
That's what made me actually
stand up and push.


97
0:3:36,55 --> 0:3:37,23
MALE SPEAKER: Do it again.


98
0:3:37,23 --> 0:3:39,22
PATRICK O'DELL: Would you say
you were good right off the


99
0:3:39,22 --> 0:3:39,95
bat at skating?


100
0:3:39,95 --> 0:3:42,16
ERIC KOSTON: Not right off the
bat, but I guess I progressed


101
0:3:42,16 --> 0:3:43,41
probably pretty quickly.


102
0:3:43,41 --> 0:3:45,91



103
0:3:45,91 --> 0:3:48,12
I remember just being freaked
out, like what if I


104
0:3:48,12 --> 0:3:48,79
just don't make it?


105
0:3:48,79 --> 0:3:51,23
What if I hook up and flip--
that's all you could think--


106
0:3:51,23 --> 0:3:54,39
hook up and flip over
straight to my face.


107
0:3:54,39 --> 0:3:56,66
And eventually I worked
my way up slowly,


108
0:3:56,66 --> 0:3:57,91
gradually, to the top.


109
0:3:57,91 --> 0:4:0,846



110
0:4:0,846 --> 0:4:4,15
You know, finally like, oh,
that's all you had to do?


111
0:4:4,15 --> 0:4:7,48



112
0:4:7,48 --> 0:4:9,25
PATRICK O'DELL: So how did
you get sponsored?


113
0:4:9,25 --> 0:4:12,4
ERIC KOSTON: I got sponsored
because Eddie Elguera-- he


114
0:4:12,4 --> 0:4:14,89
lived in Redlands, which was
right next to San Bernardino.


115
0:4:14,89 --> 0:4:17,29
And so we just ended up
meeting that way.


116
0:4:17,29 --> 0:4:19,525
EDDIE ELGUERA: Slam-ola.


117
0:4:19,525 --> 0:4:21,38
Slammy-ola.


118
0:4:21,38 --> 0:4:23,982
ERIC KOSTON: Eddie, he was like
an OG vert and pool dude.


119
0:4:23,982 --> 0:4:24,964
EDDIE ELGUERA: Ah.


120
0:4:24,964 --> 0:4:27,91
Ooh, got to skate.


121
0:4:27,91 --> 0:4:31,34
ERIC KOSTON: He was really good
on mini-ramps, and lot of


122
0:4:31,34 --> 0:4:32,76
dancing on the coping.


123
0:4:32,76 --> 0:4:34,69
He invented the frontside
rock-- or maybe


124
0:4:34,69 --> 0:4:35,84
Duane Peters did.


125
0:4:35,84 --> 0:4:37,38
It's still-- there's
controversy there.


126
0:4:37,38 --> 0:4:39,91
I still think there's
some beef.


127
0:4:39,91 --> 0:4:41,96
He invented the Elguerial, which
is kind of like going up


128
0:4:41,96 --> 0:4:44,56
fakie, kind of a full
cab into an invert.


129
0:4:44,56 --> 0:4:49,35
He was that mix of ripping
backyard pool guy, and still


130
0:4:49,35 --> 0:4:50,52
skating vert as well.


131
0:4:50,52 --> 0:4:52,17
EDDIE ELGUERA: When I got
connected with Eric, I was


132
0:4:52,17 --> 0:4:55,58
doing a vert demo in Highland,
California.


133
0:4:55,58 --> 0:4:57,3
And he lived in San
Bernardino.


134
0:4:57,3 --> 0:4:58,39
So he was always
hanging around.


135
0:4:58,39 --> 0:5:0,77
And they said, this guy
is just tearing it up.

0:5:0,77 --> 0:5:3,35
[SKATEBOARD SOUNDS]


137
0:5:3,35 --> 0:5:5,41
EDDIE ELGUERA: From that time,
we kind of hung out a lot.


138
0:5:5,41 --> 0:5:9,13
I had a half pipe in my
backyard, a little mini-ramp.


139
0:5:9,13 --> 0:5:11,7



140
0:5:11,7 --> 0:5:15,93
It was just straight for hours,
filming, videotaping.


141
0:5:15,93 --> 0:5:17,49
He was doing all
kinds of stuff.


142
0:5:17,49 --> 0:5:19,34
He was just busting out.


143
0:5:19,34 --> 0:5:21,46
So way back then, when he was
like 15 years old, he would


144
0:5:21,46 --> 0:5:22,98
just do stuff like that.


145
0:5:22,98 --> 0:5:28,92
And I think it helped him,
really, into street skating.


146
0:5:28,92 --> 0:5:31,69
Just being able to do that stuff
on the mini-ramps, or


147
0:5:31,69 --> 0:5:33,97
the vert, or transition--


148
0:5:33,97 --> 0:5:35,335
helped him when he
went to street.

always tearing it up.


151

I'm telling you, he just had
that talent that you knew that


152
0:5:47,65 --> 0:5:49,77
he was going to be great.


153

ERIC KOSTON: Yeah, I
was probably 14.


154
0:5:53,7 --> 0:5:58,11
Eddie started giving me boards
from that point.


155
0:5:58,11 --> 0:6:0,6
No, I didn't really
state like him.


156
0:6:0,6 --> 0:6:1,31
I just skated with him.

I'd call it, a protege?


162
0:6:11,72 --> 0:6:16,23
Or more of like a
mentor, I think.


163
0:6:16,23 --> 0:6:20,58
EDDIE ELGUERA: Yeah,
do that puppy.


164
0:6:20,58 --> 0:6:21,35
I used to flow him.


165
0:6:21,35 --> 0:6:23,22
We used to take him to demos.


166
0:6:23,22 --> 0:6:24,41
We used to go out and demo.


167
0:6:24,41 --> 0:6:26,73
ERIC KOSTON: There was a demo in
San Bernardino, and Hensley


168
0:6:26,73 --> 0:6:29,35
came, and Steve Ortega.


169
0:6:29,35 --> 0:6:34,12
And I was just skating this
quarter pipe, just trying to


170
0:6:34,12 --> 0:6:36,13
hometown hero it, little dude.


171
0:6:36,13 --> 0:6:40,5
And skating with Matt Hensley,
it was like the most insane


172
0:6:40,5 --> 0:6:41,68
dream session too by the way.


173
0:6:41,68 --> 0:6:46,5
At that point, he was the
best, in my eyes.


174
0:6:46,5 --> 0:6:49,68
Hensley was like the gnarliest
dude out at the time.


175
0:6:49,68 --> 0:6:54,6
I guess after that, Hensley
had gone back and said


176
0:6:54,6 --> 0:6:57,7
something to Mike Ternasky
about me as well.


177
0:6:57,7 --> 0:7:0,97
So than Eddie told me that
Ternasky wanted to meet me.


178
0:7:0,97 --> 0:7:2,33
EDDIE ELGUERA: At that time,
he wasn't sponsored.


179
0:7:2,33 --> 0:7:4,8
I was trying to get him
sponsored, even with H-Street.


180
0:7:4,8 --> 0:7:6,56
At first, they were like,
no, we're not sure.


181
0:7:6,56 --> 0:7:7,87
We have a lot of guys
on the team.


182

I'm telling you, you
need this guy.


183
0:7:10,56 --> 0:7:12,66
You need to get him on the team,
because if not, you're


184
0:7:12,66 --> 0:7:15,22
going to blow it.


185
0:7:15,22 --> 0:7:17,29

right now, this guy


186
0:7:17,29 --> 0:7:19,46
is going to be amazing.


187
0:7:19,46 --> 0:7:20,365
TIM GAVIN: I remember when
we first met him.


188
0:7:20,365 --> 0:7:24,55
We were just like talking to the
dude, and going, there's


189
0:7:24,55 --> 0:7:26,32
no way this dude is getting
on H-Street.


190
0:7:26,32 --> 0:7:27,75
I remember seeing the dude,
and he was this


191
0:7:27,75 --> 0:7:29,537
nerdy-looking dude.


192
0:7:29,537 --> 0:7:32,19
I was like, who the fuck
are these losers?


193
0:7:32,19 --> 0:7:34,89
But for some reason, maybe it
was an Asian bond between us,


194
0:7:34,89 --> 0:7:37,89
but I just went up to him and
tried to make the guy feel


195
0:7:37,89 --> 0:7:38,32
comfortable.


196
0:7:38,32 --> 0:7:40,3
There was a Castle contest
that same day.


197
0:7:40,3 --> 0:7:41,14
We went to the contest.


198
0:7:41,14 --> 0:7:43,3
First time I've ever seen this
guy skate, I was like, this


199
0:7:43,3 --> 0:7:44,36
guy's unbelievable.


200
0:7:44,36 --> 0:7:47,44
He was doing those 540 ollies
on the quarter pipe.


201
0:7:47,44 --> 0:7:49,6
But he was fucking--


202
0:7:49,6 --> 0:7:51,475
he was doing everything.


203
0:7:51,475 --> 0:7:52,405

EDDIE ELGUERA: But then finally
they came around and


206
0:7:57,8 --> 0:7:58,48
said, yeah, you know
what, you're right.


207
0:7:58,48 --> 0:8:0,823
And then he just went from
there and got sponsored.


208
0:8:0,823 --> 0:8:4,7



209
0:8:4,7 --> 0:8:6,47
AARON MEZA: I first heard of
him in the H-Street video.


210
0:8:6,47 --> 0:8:7,87
That's the first time anybody
heard of him.


211
0:8:7,87 --> 0:8:10,62
And it was true, you kind of
got the idea that it was


212
0:8:10,62 --> 0:8:12,9
Eddie's little protege.


213
0:8:12,9 --> 0:8:13,82
His only footage is
in his driveway.


214
0:8:13,82 --> 0:8:16,2
So this must be his
little buddy.


215
0:8:16,2 --> 0:8:18,19
EDDIE ELGUERA: He really wanted
to be a professional


216
0:8:18,19 --> 0:8:20,42
skateboarder, gave
his time to it.


217
0:8:20,42 --> 0:8:23,95
Actually, I think, he quit
school and just was stating


218
0:8:23,95 --> 0:8:25,7
all the time.


219
0:8:25,7 --> 0:8:27,68
And I really wanted to
see him succeed,


220
0:8:27,68 --> 0:8:28,93
because I saw the talent.


221
0:8:28,93 --> 0:8:31,75



222
0:8:31,75 --> 0:8:33,788
What was that?

ERIC KOSTON: Impossible
to nosepick.


224
0:8:35,929 --> 0:8:37,47
EDDIE ELGUERA: I was the
director of a skateboard camp


225
0:8:37,47 --> 0:8:39,179
in Wisconsin, Lake Owen.


226
0:8:39,179 --> 0:8:40,289
ERIC KOSTON: Yeah, Eddie.


227
0:8:40,289 --> 0:8:41,32
Oh.


228
0:8:41,32 --> 0:8:42,78
Where'd that one come from?


229
0:8:42,78 --> 0:8:43,57
EDDIE ELGUERA: I took him up.


230
0:8:43,57 --> 0:8:46,472
He was one of the skate
instructors.


231
0:8:46,472 --> 0:8:46,876
ERIC KOSTON: Sorry, camera.


232
0:8:46,876 --> 0:8:47,79
EDDIE ELGUERA: All right,
come on, man.


233
0:8:47,79 --> 0:8:49,66
Come on, now.


234
0:8:49,66 --> 0:8:53,23
You need to make it or die.


235
0:8:53,23 --> 0:8:55,69
Yeah, Steve.


236
0:8:55,69 --> 0:8:58,175
I recently heard from some
guys that were campers.


237
0:8:58,175 --> 0:9:0,16
And then they look back
now and say, man,


238
0:9:0,16 --> 0:9:2,2
he was my camp counselor.


239
0:9:2,2 --> 0:9:4,32
But he wasn't pro or anything
at that time.


240
0:9:4,32 --> 0:9:6,866
But they knew that, man,
this guy, he's amazing.


241
0:9:6,866 --> 0:9:10,11



242
0:9:10,11 --> 0:9:13,63
I remember him doing ollie
impossibles down hand rails.


243
0:9:13,63 --> 0:9:16,56
And it's like, people can't
even do ollie impossibles.


244
0:9:16,56 --> 0:9:18,7
He'd be doing them
down hand rails.


245
0:9:18,7 --> 0:9:20,67
He was doing stuff back then
that was just amazing.


246
0:9:20,67 --> 0:9:22,542
It was just--


247
0:9:22,542 --> 0:9:23,946
it was cool to see.


248
0:9:23,946 --> 0:9:25,35
Yeah.


249
0:9:25,35 --> 0:9:26,6
Killer footage.


250
0:9:26,6 --> 0:9:30,1



251
0:9:30,1 --> 0:9:30,94
Those were great times.


252
0:9:30,94 --> 0:9:34,7
We celebrated his
16th birthday.


253
0:9:34,7 --> 0:9:36,46
Yeah.


254
0:9:36,46 --> 0:9:37,38
So it was kind of cool.


255
0:9:37,38 --> 0:9:40,62
And I just took him under
my wing, in terms of--


256
0:9:40,62 --> 0:9:43,61
just to be there for
him, in terms of--


257
0:9:43,61 --> 0:9:46,93
maybe a father figure at
that time in his life.


258
0:9:46,93 --> 0:9:49,45
It's OK, it's OK.


259
0:9:49,45 --> 0:9:52,28
Hopefully I imparted some things
into to him that maybe


260
0:9:52,28 --> 0:9:55,592
helped him to be who he is.


261
0:9:55,592 --> 0:9:57,932
Yeah.

Super good.


265
0:10:1,67 --> 0:10:4,25
I just believe sometimes, when
you have that person in your


266
0:10:4,25 --> 0:10:8,66
life that believes in you when
nobody else believes in you--


267
0:10:8,66 --> 0:10:11,59
not believe in you because of
what they can get out of you,


268
0:10:11,59 --> 0:10:14,4
but believe in you for who
you are as a person.


269
0:10:14,4 --> 0:10:16,51
I think that's important.

0:10:16,51 --> 0:10:17,76
