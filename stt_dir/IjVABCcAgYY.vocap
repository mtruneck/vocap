###0 CANDY CROWLEY, MODERATOR: Good evening from Hofstra University in Hempstead,
###2 New York. I'm Candy Crowley from CNN's "State of the Union." We are here for
###7 the second presidential debate, a town hall, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential
###11 Debates.\ CROWLEY: The Gallup organization chose 82
###15 uncommitted voters from the New York area. Their questions will drive the night. My goal
###20 is to give the conversation direction and to ensure questions get answered.\
###24 The questions are known to me and my team only. Neither the commission, nor the candidates
###28 have seen them. I hope to get to as many questions as possible.\
###32 CROWLEY: And because I am the optimistic sort, I\'92m sure the candidates will oblige by
###36 keeping their answers concise and on point.\ Each candidate has as much as two minutes
###40 to respond to a common question, and there will be a two-minute follow-up. The audience
###45 here in the hall has agreed to be polite and attentive -- no cheering or booing or outbursts
###49 of any sort.\ We will set aside that agreement just this
###53 once to welcome President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney.\
###57 (APPLAUSE)\ Gentlemen, thank you both for joining us here
###89 tonight. We have a lot of folks who\'92ve been waiting all day to talk to you, so I
###93 want to get right to it.\ Governor Romney, as you know, you won the
###96 coin toss, so the first question will go to you. And I want to turn to a first-time voter,
###102 Jeremy Epstein, who has a question for you.\ QUESTION: Mr. President, Governor Romney,
###108 as a 20-year-old college student, all I hear from professors, neighbors and others is that
###112 when I graduate, I will have little chance to get employment. What can you say to reassure
###117 me, but more importantly my parents, that I will be able to sufficiently support myself
###120 after I graduate?\ ROMNEY: Thank you, Jeremy. I appreciate your
###124 -- your question, and thank you for being here this evening and to all of those from
###127 Nassau County that have come, thank you for your time. Thank you to Hofstra University
###132 and to Candy Crowley for organizing and leading this -- this event.\
###136 Thank you, Mr. President, also for being part of this -- this debate.\
###139 Your question -- your question is one that\'92s being asked by college kids all over this
###144 country. I was in Pennsylvania with someone who had just graduated -- this was in Philadelphia
###148 -- and she said, \'93I\'92ve got my degree. I can\'92t find a job. I\'92ve got three part-
###153 time jobs. They\'92re just barely enough to pay for my food and pay for an apartment.
###157 I can\'92t begin to pay back my student loans.\'94\ So what we have to do is two things. We have
###161 to make sure that we make it easier for kids to afford college.\
###164 ROMNEY: And also make sure that when they get out of college, there\'92s a job. When
###167 I was governor of Massachusetts, to get a high school degree, you had to pass an exam.
###172 If you graduated in the top quarter of your airlines, we gave you a John and Abigail Adams
###177 scholarship, four years tuition free in the college of your choice in Massachusetts, it\'92s
###182 a public institution.\ I want to make sure we keep our Pell grant
###186 program growing. We\'92re also going to have our loan program, so that people are able
###190 to afford school. But the key thing is to make sure you can get a job when you get out
###194 of school. And what\'92s happened over the last four years has been very, very hard for
###198 America\'92s young people. I want you to be able to get a job.\
###202 I know what it takes to get this economy going. With half of college kids graduating this
###207 year without a college -- excuse me, without a job. And without a college level job, that\'92s
###212 just unacceptable.\ And likewise you\'92ve got more and more debt
###215 on your back. So more debt and less jobs. I\'92m going to change that. I know what it
###219 takes to create good jobs again. I know what it takes to make sure that you have the kind
###224 of opportunity you deserve. And kids across this country are going to recognize, we\'92re
###228 bringing back an economy.\ It\'92s not going to be like the last four
###231 years. The middle-class has been crushed over the last four years, and jobs have been too
###236 scarce. I know what it takes to bring them back, and I\'92m going to do that, and make
###239 sure that when you graduate -- when do you graduate?\
###240 QUESTION: 2014.\ ROMNEY: 2014. When you come out in 2014, I
###244 presume I\'92m going to be president. I\'92m going to make sure you get a job. Thanks Jeremy.
###248 Yeah, you bet.\ CROWLEY: Mr. President?\
###251 OBAMA: Jeremy, first of all, your future is bright. And the fact that you\'92re making
###256 an investment in higher education is critical. Not just to you, but to the entire nation.
###261 Now, the most important thing we can do is to make sure that we are creating jobs in
###266 this country. But not just jobs, good paying jobs. Ones that can support a family.\
###271 OBAMA: And what I want to do, is build on the five million jobs that we\'92ve created
###276 over the last 30 months in the private sector alone. And there are a bunch of things we
###280 can do to make sure your future is bright.\ Number one, I want to build manufacturing
###286 jobs in this country again. Now when Governor Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt.
###293 I said we\'92re going to bet on American workers and the American auto industry and it\'92s
###297 come surging back.\ I want to do that in industries, not just
###301 in Detroit, but all across the country and that means we change our tax code so we\'92re
###305 giving incentives to companies that are investing here in the United States and creating jobs
###309 here.\ It also means we\'92re helping them and small
###312 businesses to export all around the world to new markets.\
###316 Number two, we\'92ve got to make sure that we have the best education system in the world.
###321 And the fact that you\'92re going to college is great, but I want everybody to get a great
###325 education and we\'92ve worked hard to make sure that student loans are available for
###329 folks like you, but I also want to make sure that community colleges are offering slots
###333 for workers to get retrained for the jobs that are out there right now and the jobs
###337 of the future.\ Number three, we\'92ve got to control our
###340 own energy. Now, not only oil and natural gas, which we\'92ve been investing in; but
###346 also, we\'92ve got to make sure we\'92re building the energy source of the future, not just
###350 thinking about next year, but ten years from now, 20 years from now. That\'92s why we\'92ve
###354 invested in solar and wind and biofuels, energy efficient cars.\
###358 We\'92ve got to reduce our deficit, but we\'92ve got to do it in a balanced way. Asking the
###362 wealthy to pay a little bit more along with cuts so that we can invest in education like
###366 yours.\ And let\'92s take the money that we\'92ve
###368 been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild America, roads, bridges schools.
###374 We do those things, not only is your future going to be bright but America\'92s future
###377 is going to bright as well.\ CROWLEY: Let me ask you for more immediate
###382 answer and begin with Mr. Romney just quickly what -- what can you do? We\'92re looking
###388 at a situation where 40 percent of the unemployed have been unemployed have been unemployed
###392 for six months or more. They don\'92t have the two years that Jeremy has.\
###397 What about those long term unemployed who need a job right now?\
###401 ROMNEY: Well what you\'92re seeing in this country is 23 million people struggling to
###405 find a job. And a lot of them, as you say, Candy, have been out of work for a long, long,
###409 long time. The president\'92s policies have been exercised over the last four years and
###414 they haven\'92t put Americans back to work.\ We have fewer people working today than we
###419 had when the president took office. If the -- the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent when
###424 he took office, it\'92s 7.8 percent now. But if you calculated that unemployment rate,
###429 taking back the people who dropped out of the workforce, it would be 10.7 percent.\
###433 We have not made the progress we need to make to put people back to work. That\'92s why
###437 I put out a five-point plan that gets America 12 million new jobs in four years and rising
###444 take-home pay. It\'92s going to help Jeremy get a job when he comes out of school. It\'92s
###447 going to help people across the country that are unemployed right now.\
###451 And one thing that the president said, which I want to make sure that we understand, he
###455 said that I said we should take Detroit bankrupt. And that\'92s right. My plan was to have the
###460 company go through bankruptcy like 7-Eleven did and Macy\'92s and Condell (ph) Airlines
###466 and come out stronger.\ And I know he keeps saying, you want to take
###469 Detroit bankrupt. Well, the president took Detroit bankrupt. You took General Motors
###474 bankrupt. You took Chrysler bankrupt. So when you say that I wanted to take the auto industry
###479 bankrupt, you actually did.\ And I think it\'92s important to know that
###483 that was a process that was necessary to get those companies back on their feet, so they
###488 could start hiring more people. That was precisely what I recommended and ultimately what happened.\
###493 CROWLEY: Let me give the president a chance.\ Go ahead. OBAMA: Candy, what Governor Romney
###497 said just isn\'92t true. He wanted to take them into bankruptcy without providing them
###504 any way to stay open. And we would have lost a million jobs. And that -- don\'92t take
###509 my word for it, take the executives at GM and Chrysler, some of whom are Republicans,
###515 may even support Governor Romney. But they\'92ll tell you his prescription wasn\'92t going
###518 to work.\ And Governor Romney\'92s says he\'92s got
###520 a five-point plan? Governor Romney doesn\'92t have a five-point plan. He has a one-point
###524 plan. And that plan is to make sure that folks at the top play by a different set of rules.
###531 That\'92s been his philosophy in the private sector, that\'92s been his philosophy as governor,
###535 that\'92s been his philosophy as a presidential candidate.\
###538 You can make a lot of money and pay lower tax rates than somebody who makes a lot less.
###544 You can ship jobs overseas and get tax breaks for it. You can invest in a company, bankrupt
###550 it, lay off the workers, strip away their pensions, and you still make money.\
###554 That\'92s exactly the philosophy that we\'92ve seen in place for the last decade. That\'92s
###561 what\'92s been squeezing middle class families.\ And we have fought back for four years to
###567 get out of that mess. The last thing we need to do is to go back to the very same policies
###572 that got us there.\ CROWLEY: Mr. President, the next question
###575 is going to be for you here.\ And, Mr. Romney -- Governor Romney -- there\'92ll
###578 be plenty of chances here to go on, but I want to...\
###580 ROMNEY: That -- that Detroit -- that Detroit answer...\
###580 CROWLEY: We have all these folks.\ ROMNEY: ... that Detroit answer...\
###581 CROWLEY: I will let you absolutely...\ ROMNEY: ... and the rest of the answer, way
###585 off the mark.\ CROWLEY: OK. Will -- will -- you certainly
###587 will have lots of time here coming up.\ Because I want to move you on to something
###590 that\'92s sort of connected to cars here, and -- and go over. And we want to get a question
###595 from Phillip Tricolla.\ QUESTION: Your energy secretary, Steven Chu,
###606 has now been on record three times stating it\'92s not policy of his department to help
###611 lower gas prices. Do you agree with Secretary Chu that this is not the job of the Energy
###617 Department?\ OBAMA: The most important thing we can do
###622 is to make sure we control our own energy. So here\'92s what I\'92ve done since I\'92ve
###627 been president. We have increased oil production to the highest levels in 16 years.\
###634 Natural gas production is the highest it\'92s been in decades. We have seen increases in
###640 coal production and coal employment. But what I\'92ve also said is we can\'92t just produce
###648 traditional source of energy. We\'92ve also got to look to the future. That\'92s why we
###651 doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars. That means that in the middle of the next
###655 decade, any car you buy, you\'92re going to end up going twice as far on a gallon of gas.
###660 That\'92s why we doubled clean -- clean energy production like wind and solar and biofuels.\
###665 And all these things have contributed to us lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels
###671 in 16 years. Now, I want to build on that. And that means, yes, we still continue to
###677 open up new areas for drilling. We continue to make it a priority for us to go after natural
###684 gas. We\'92ve got potentially 600,000 jobs and 100 years worth of energy right beneath
###689 our feet with natural gas.\ And we can do it in an environmentally sound
###693 way. But we\'92ve also got to continue to figure out how we have efficiency energy,
###699 because ultimately that\'92s how we\'92re going to reduce demand and that\'92s what\'92s
###702 going to keep gas prices lower.\ Now, Governor Romney will say he\'92s got
###708 an all-of-the-above plan, but basically his plan is to let the oil companies write the
###714 energy policies. So he\'92s got the oil and gas part, but he doesn\'92t have the clean
###720 energy part. And if we are only thinking about tomorrow or the next day and not thinking
###727 about 10 years from now, we\'92re not going to control our own economic future. Because
###733 China, Germany, they\'92re making these investments. And I\'92m not going to cede those jobs of
###738 the future to those countries. I expect those new energy sources to be built right here
###743 in the United States.\ That\'92s going to help Jeremy get a job.
###745 It\'92s also going to make sure that you\'92re not paying as much for gas.\
###748 CROWLEY: Governor, on the subject of gas prices?\ ROMNEY: Well, let\'92s look at the president\'92s
###754 policies, all right, as opposed to the rhetoric, because we\'92ve had four years of policies
###758 being played out. And the president\'92s right in terms of the additional oil production,
###764 but none of it came on federal land. As a matter of fact, oil production is down 14
###769 percent this year on federal land, and gas production was down 9 percent. Why? Because
###773 the president cut in half the number of licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands,
###779 and in federal waters.\ So where\'92d the increase come from? Well
###782 a lot of it came from the Bakken Range in North Dakota. What was his participation there?
###787 The administration brought a criminal action against the people drilling up there for oil,
###792 this massive new resource we have. And what was the cost? 20 or 25 birds were killed and
###798 brought out a migratory bird act to go after them on a criminal basis.\
###801 Look, I want to make sure we use our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables.
###809 I believe very much in our renewable capabilities; ethanol, wind, solar will be an important
###814 part of our energy mix.\ But what we don\'92t need is to have the president
###818 keeping us from taking advantage of oil, coal and gas. This has not been Mr. Oil, or Mr.
###824 Gas, or Mr. Coal. Talk to the people that are working in those industries. I was in
###828 coal country. People grabbed my arms and said, \'93Please save my job.\'94 The head of the
###834 EPA said, \'93You can\'92t build a coal plant. You\'92ll virtually -- it\'92s virtually impossible
###838 given our regulations.\'94 When the president ran for office, he said if you build a coal
###842 plant, you can go ahead, but you\'92ll go bankrupt. That\'92s not the right course for
###847 America.\ Let\'92s take advantage of the energy resources
###849 we have, as well as the energy sources for the future. And if we do that, if we do what
###855 I\'92m planning on doing, which is getting us energy independent, North America energy
###861 independence within eight years, you\'92re going to see manufacturing jobs come back.
###866 Because our energy is low cost, that are already beginning to come back because of our abundant
###871 energy. I\'92ll get America and North America energy independent. I\'92ll do it by more
###876 drilling, more permits and licenses.\ We\'92re going to bring that pipeline in from
###880 Canada. How in the world the president said no to that pipeline? I will never know.\
###884 This is about bringing good jobs back for the middle class of America, and that\'92s
###889 what I\'92m going to do. CROWLEY: Mr. President, let me just see if I can move you to the gist
###893 of this question, which is, are we looking at the new normal? I can tell you that tomorrow
###897 morning, a lot of people in Hempstead will wake up and fill up and they will find that
###900 the price of gas is over $4 a gallon.\ Is it within the purview of the government
###906 to bring those prices down, or are we looking at the new normal?\
###909 OBAMA: Candy, there\'92s no doubt that world demand\'92s gone up, but our production is
###914 going up, and we\'92re using oil more efficiently. And very little of what Governor Romney just
###919 said is true. We\'92ve opened up public lands. We\'92re actually drilling more on public
###926 lands than in the previous administration and my -- the previous president was an oil
###931 man.\ And natural gas isn\'92t just appearing magically.
###935 We\'92re encouraging it and working with the industry.\
###939 And when I hear Governor Romney say he\'92s a big coal guy, I mean, keep in mind, when
###944 -- Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts, you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed
###949 at it and said, \'93This plant kills,\'94 and took great pride in shutting it down.
###955 And now suddenly you\'92re a big champion of coal.\
###958 So what I\'92ve tried to do is be consistent. With respect to something like coal, we made
###963 the largest investment in clean coal technology, to make sure that even as we\'92re producing
###969 more coal, we\'92re producing it cleaner and smarter. Same thing with oil, same thing with
###973 natural gas.\ And the proof is our oil imports are down
###977 to the lowest levels in 20 years. Oil production is up, natural gas production is up, and,
###985 most importantly, we\'92re also starting to build cars that are more efficient.\
###989 And that\'92s creating jobs. That means those cars can be exported, \'91cause that\'92s
###992 the demand around the world, and it also means that it\'92ll save money in your pocketbook.\
###997 OBAMA: That\'92s the strategy you need, an all-of-the-above strategy, and that\'92s what
###1000 we\'92re going to do in the next four years.\ ROMNEY: But that\'92s not what you\'92ve done
###1004 in the last four years. That\'92s the problem. In the last four years, you cut permits and
###1010 licenses on federal land and federal waters in half.\
###1012 OBAMA: Not true, Governor Romney.\ ROMNEY: So how much did you cut (inaudible)?\
###1014 OBAMA: Not true.\ ROMNEY: How much did you cut them by, then?\
###1016 OBAMA: Governor, we have actually produced more oil --\
###1018 ROMNEY: No, no. How much did you cut licenses and permits on federal land and federal waters?\
###1021 OBAMA: Governor Romney, here\'92s what we did. There were a whole bunch of oil companies.\
###1025 (CROSSTALK)\ ROMNEY: No, no, I had a question and the question
###1027 was how much did you cut them by?\ OBAMA: You want me to answer a question --\
###1029 ROMNEY: How much did you cut them by?\ OBAMA: I\'92m happy to answer the question.\
###1031 ROMNEY: All right. And it is --\ OBAMA: Here\'92s what happened. You had a
###1034 whole bunch of oil companies who had leases on public lands that they weren\'92t using.
###1040 So what we said was you can\'92t just sit on this for 10, 20, 30 years, decide when
###1046 you want to drill, when you want to produce, when it\'92s most profitable for you. These
###1051 are public lands. So if you want to drill on public lands, you use it or you lose it.\
###1058 ROMNEY: OK, (inaudible) --\ OBAMA: And so what we did was take away those
###1060 leases. And we are now reletting them so that we can actually make a profit.\
###1063 ROMNEY: And production on private -- on government land --\
###1065 OBAMA: Production is up.\ ROMNEY: -- is down.\
###1066 OBAMA: No, it isn\'92t.\ ROMNEY: Production on government land of oil
###1068 is down 14 percent.\ OBAMA: Governor --\
###1069 ROMNEY: And production on gas --\ (CROSSTALK)\
###1071 OBAMA: It\'92s just not true.\ ROMNEY: It\'92s absolutely true. Look, there\'92s
###1075 no question but the people recognize that we have not produced more (inaudible) on federal
###1080 lands and in federal waters. And coal, coal production is not up; coal jobs are not up.\
###1085 I was just at a coal facility, where some 1,200 people lost their jobs. The right course
###1090 for America is to have a true all-of-the-above policy. I don\'92t think anyone really believes
###1095 that you\'92re a person who\'92s going to be pushing for oil and gas and coal. You\'92ll
###1099 get your chance in a moment. I\'92m still speaking.\
###1101 OBAMA: Well --\ ROMNEY: And the answer is I don\'92t believe
###1103 people think that\'92s the case --\ OBAMA: -- (inaudible).\
###1104 ROMNEY: That wasn\'92t the question.\ OBAMA: OK.\
###1105 ROMNEY: That was a statement. I don\'92t think the American people believe that. I will fight
###1109 for oil, coal and natural gas. And the proof, the proof of whether a strategy is working
###1114 or not is what the price is that you\'92re paying at the pump. If you\'92re paying less
###1119 than you paid a year or two ago, why, then, the strategy is working. But you\'92re paying
###1124 more. When the president took office, the price of gasoline here in Nassau County was
###1127 about $1.86 a gallon. Now, it\'92s $4.00 a gallon. The price of electricity is up.\
###1133 If the president\'92s energy policies are working, you\'92re going to see the cost of
###1136 energy come down. I will fight to create more energy in this country, to get America energy
###1142 secure. And part of that is bringing in a pipeline of oil from Canada, taking advantage
###1148 of the oil and coal we have here, drilling offshore in Alaska, drilling offshore in Virginia
###1153 where the people want it. Those things will get us the energy we need.\
###1156 CROWLEY: Mr. President, could you address, because we did finally get to gas prices here,
###1160 could you address what the governor said, which is if your energy policy was working,
###1167 the price of gasoline would not be $4 a gallon here. Is that true?\
###1170 OBAMA: Well, think about what the governor -- think about what the governor just said.
###1172 He said when I took office, the price of gasoline was $1.80, $1.86. Why is that? Because the
###1178 economy was on the verge of collapse, because we were about to go through the worst recession
###1184 since the Great Depression, as a consequence of some of the same policies that Governor
###1190 Romney\'92s now promoting.\ So, it\'92s conceivable that Governor Romney
###1193 could bring down gas prices because with his policies, we might be back in that same mess.\
###1199 What I want to do is to create an economy that is strong, and at the same time produce
###1207 energy. And with respect to this pipeline that Governor Romney keeps on talking about,
###1211 we\'92ve -- we\'92ve built enough pipeline to wrap around the entire earth once.\
###1217 So, I\'92m all for pipelines. I\'92m all for oil production. What I\'92m not for is us
###1223 ignoring the other half of the equation. So, for example, on wind energy, when Governor
###1227 Romney says \'93these are imaginary jobs.\'94 When you\'92ve got thousands of people right
###1232 now in Iowa, right now in Colorado, who are working, creating wind power with good-paying
###1239 manufacturing jobs, and the Republican senator in that -- in Iowa is all for it, providing
###1246 tax breaks (ph) to help this work and Governor Romney says I\'92m opposed. I\'92d get rid
###1252 of it.\ That\'92s not an energy strategy for the future.
###1254 And we need to win that future. And I intend to win it as President of the United States.\
###1257 CROWLEY: I got to -- I got to move you on --\
###1259 ROMNEY: He gets the first --\ CROWLEY: -- and the next question --\
###1260 ROMNEY: He actually got --\ CROWLEY: -- for you --\
###1261 ROMNEY: He actually got the first question. So I get the last question -- last answer
###1264 --\ CROWLEY: (Inaudible) in the follow up, it
###1265 doesn\'92t quite work like that. But I\'92m going to give you a chance here. I promise
###1269 you, I\'92m going to.\ And the next question is for you. So if you
###1272 want to, you know, continue on -- but I don\'92t want to leave all --\
###1276 ROMNEY: Candy, Candy --\ CROWLEY: -- sitting here --\
###1277 ROMNEY: Candy, I don\'92t have a policy of stopping wind jobs in Iowa and that -- they\'92re
###1281 not phantom jobs. They\'92re real jobs.\ CROWLEY: OK.\
###1284 ROMNEY: I appreciate wind jobs in Iowa and across our country. I appreciate the jobs
###1288 in coal and oil and gas. I\'92m going to make sure --\
###1292 CROWLEY: OK.\ ROMNEY: -- we\'92re taking advantage of our
###1293 energy resources. We\'92ll bring back manufacturing to America. We\'92re going to get through
###1298 a very aggressive energy policy, 31/2 million more jobs in this country. It\'92s critical
###1303 to our future.\ OBAMA: Candy, it\'92s not going to --\
###1304 CROWLEY: We\'92re going to move you along --\
###1306 OBAMA: Used to being interrupted.\ CROWLEY: We\'92re going to move you both along
###1308 to taxes over here and all these folks that have been waiting.\
###1312 Governor, this question is for you. It comes from Mary Follano -- Follano, sorry.\
###1316 ROMNEY: Hi, Mary.\ QUESTION: Governor Romney, you have stated
###1321 that if you\'92re elected president, you would plan to reduce the tax rates for all the tax
###1326 brackets and that you would work with the Congress to eliminate some deductions in order
###1332 to make up for the loss in revenue.\ Concerning the -- these various deductions,
###1339 the mortgage deductions, the charitable deductions, the child tax credit and also the -- oh, what\'92s
###1346 that other credit? I forgot.\ OBAMA: You\'92re doing great.\
###1350 QUESTION: Oh, I remember.\ The education credits, which are important
###1355 to me, because I have children in college. What would be your position on those things,
###1360 which are important to the middle class?\ ROMNEY: Thank you very much. And let me tell
###1365 you, you\'92re absolutely right about part of that, which is I want to bring the rates
###1368 down, I want to simplify the tax code, and I want to get middle- income taxpayers to
###1375 have lower taxes.\ And the reason I want middle-income taxpayers
###1379 to have lower taxes is because middle-income taxpayers have been buried over the past four
###1384 years. You\'92ve seen, as middle-income people in this country, incomes go down $4,300 a
###1390 family, even as gasoline prices have gone up $2,000. Health insurance premiums, up $2,500.
###1396 Food prices up. Utility prices up.\ The middle-income families in America have
###1403 been crushed over the last four years. So I want to get some relief to middle-income
###1406 families. That\'92s part -- that\'92s part one.\
###1409 Now, how about deductions? \'91Cause I\'92m going to bring rates down across the board
###1412 for everybody, but I\'92m going to limit deductions and exemptions and credits, particularly for
###1417 people at the high end, because I am not going to have people at the high end pay less than
###1422 they\'92re paying now.\ The top 5 percent of taxpayers will continue
###1426 to pay 60 percent of the income tax the nation collects. So that\'92ll stay the same.\
###1433 Middle-income people are going to get a tax break.\
###1436 And so, in terms of bringing down deductions, one way of doing that would be say everybody
###1440 gets -- I\'92ll pick a number -- $25,000 of deductions and credits, and you can decide
###1445 which ones to use. Your home mortgage interest deduction, charity, child tax credit, and
###1451 so forth, you can use those as part of filling that bucket, if you will, of deductions.\
###1455 But your rate comes down and the burden also comes down on you for one more reason, and
###1460 that is every middle-income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends or
###1466 capital gains. No tax on your savings. That makes life a lot easier.\
###1472 If you\'92re getting interest from a bank, if you\'92re getting a statement from a mutual
###1477 fund or any other kind of investment you have, you don\'92t have to worry about filing taxes
###1481 on that, because there\'92ll be no taxes for anybody making $200,000.00 per year and less,
###1487 on your interest, dividends and capital gains. Why am I lowering taxes on the middle-class?
###1492 Because under the last four years, they\'92ve been buried. And I want to help people in
###1496 the middle-class.\ And I will not -- I will not under any circumstances,
###1501 reduce the share that\'92s being paid by the highest income taxpayers. And I will not,
###1504 under any circumstances increase taxes on the middle-class. The president\'92s spending,
###1510 the president\'92s borrowing will cost this nation to have to raise taxes on the American
###1515 people. Not just at the high end. A recent study has shown the people in the middle-class
###1520 will see $4,000.00 per year in higher taxes as a result of the spending and borrowing
###1525 of this administration.\ I will not let that happen. I want to get
###1528 us on track to a balanced budget, and I\'92m going to reduce the tax burden on middle income
###1533 families. And what\'92s that going to do? It\'92s going to help those families, and
###1536 it\'92s going to create incentives to start growing jobs again in this country.\
###1540 CROWLEY: Thanks, Governor.\ OBAMA: My philosophy on taxes has been simple.
###1546 And that is, I want to give middle-class families and folks who are striving to get into the
###1552 middle-class some relief. Because they have been hit hard over the last decade. Over the
###1557 last 15, over the last 20 years.\ So four years ago I stood on a stage just
###1561 like this one. Actually it was a town hall, and I said I would cut taxes for middle- class
###1565 families, and that\'92s what I\'92ve done, by $3,600.00. I said I would cut taxes for
###1570 small businesses, who are the drivers and engines of growth. And we\'92ve cut them 18
###1575 times. And I want to continue those tax cuts for middle-class families, and for small business.\
###1584 But what I\'92ve also said is, if we\'92re serious about reducing the deficit, if this
###1589 is genuinely a moral obligation to the next generation, then in addition to some tough
###1595 spending cuts, we\'92ve also got to make sure that the wealthy do a little bit more.\
###1601 So what I\'92ve said is, your first $250,000.00 worth of income, no change. And that means
###1608 98 percent of American families, 97 percent of small businesses, they will not see a tax
###1614 increase. I\'92m ready to sign that bill right now. The only reason it\'92s not happening
###1618 is because Governor Romney\'92s allies in Congress have held the 98 percent hostage
###1623 because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent.\
###1626 But what I\'92ve also says is for above $250,000, we can go back to the tax rates we had when
###1633 Bill Clinton was president. We created 23 million new jobs. That\'92s part of what took
###1638 us from deficits to surplus. It will be good for our economy and it will be good for job
###1644 creation.\ Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy.
###1649 He was on 60 Minutes just two weeks ago and he was asked: Is it fair for somebody like
###1656 you, making $20 million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody
###1661 making $50,000 year? And he said, \'93Yes, I think that\'92s fair.\'94 Not only that,
###1666 he said, \'93I think that\'92s what grows the economy.\'94\
###1669 Well, I fundamentally disagree with that. I think what grows the economy is when you
###1674 get that tax credit that we put in place for your kids going to college. I think that grows
###1680 the economy. I think what grows the economy is when we make sure small businesses are
###1684 getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who fought for our country. That grows our economy.\
###1689 So we just have a different theory. And when Governor Romney stands here, after a year
###1693 of campaigning, when during a Republican primary he stood on stage and said \'93I\'92m going
###1699 to give tax cuts\'94 -- he didn\'92t say tax rate cuts, he said \'93tax cuts to everybody,\'94
###1704 including the top 1 percent, you should believe him because that\'92s been his history.\
###1710 And that\'92s exactly the kind of top-down economics that is not going to work if we
###1714 want a strong middle class and an economy that\'92s striving for everybody.\
###1718 CROWLEY: Governor Romney, I\'92m sure you\'92ve got a reply there.\
###1722 (LAUGHTER) ROMNEY: You\'92re absolutely right.\ You heard what I said about my tax plan. The
###1727 top 5 percent will continue to pay 60 percent, as they do today. I\'92m not looking to cut
###1732 taxes for wealthy people. I am looking to cut taxes for middle-income people.\
###1737 And why do I want to bring rates down, and at the same time lower exemptions and deductions,
###1742 particularly for people at the high end? Because if you bring rates down, it makes it easier
###1747 for small business to keep more of their capital and hire people.\
###1751 And for me, this is about jobs. I want to get America\'92s economy going again. Fifty-four
###1757 percent of America\'92s workers work in businesses that are taxed as individuals. So when you
###1763 bring those rates down, those small businesses are able to keep more money and hire more
###1768 people.\ For me, I look at what\'92s happened in the
###1770 last four years and say this has been a disappointment. We can do better than this. We don\'92t have
###1776 to settle for, how many months, 43 months with unemployment above 8 percent, 23 million
###1783 Americans struggling to find a good job right now.\
###1785 There are 3.5 million more women living in poverty today than when the president took
###1790 office.\ We don\'92t have to live like this. We can
###1793 get this economy going again. My five-point plan does it. Energy independence for North
###1798 America in five years. Opening up more trade, particularly in Latin America. Cracking down
###1802 on China when they cheat. Getting us to a balanced budget. Fixing our training programs
###1807 for our workers. And finally, championing small business.\
###1811 I want to make small businesses grow and thrive. I know how to make that happen. I spent my
###1816 life in the private sector. I know why jobs come and why they go. And they\'92re going
###1821 now because of the policies of this administration.\ CROWLEY: Governor, let me ask the president
###1825 something about what you just said.\ The governor says that he is not going to
###1831 allow the top 5 percent, believe is what he said, to have a tax cut, that it will all
###1837 even out, that what he wants to do is give that tax cut to the middle class. Settled?\
###1842 OBAMA: No, it\'92s not settled.\ Look, the cost of lowering rates for everybody
###1851 across the board, 20 percent. Along with what he also wants to do in terms of eliminating
###1856 the estate tax, along what he wants to do in terms of corporates, changes in the tax
###1862 code, it costs about $5 trillion.\ Governor Romney then also wants to spend $2
###1868 trillion on additional military programs even though the military\'92s not asking for them.
###1873 That\'92s $7 trillion.\ He also wants to continue the Bush tax cuts
###1877 for the wealthiest Americans. That\'92s another trillion dollars -- that\'92s $8 trillion.\
###1882 Now, what he says is he\'92s going to make sure that this doesn\'92t add to the deficit
###1889 and he\'92s going to cut middleclass taxes.\ But when he\'92s asked, how are you going
###1894 to do it, which deductions, which loopholes are you going to close? He can\'92t tell you.\
###1900 The -- the fact that he only has to pay 14 percent on his taxes when a lot of you are
###1906 paying much higher. He\'92s already taken that off the board, capital gains are going
###1911 to continue to be at a low rate so we -- we\'92re not going to get money that way.\
###1916 We haven\'92t heard from the governor any specifics beyond Big Bird and eliminating
###1923 funding for Planned Parenthood in terms of how he pays for that.\
###1926 Now, Governor Romney was a very successful investor. If somebody came to you, Governor,
###1933 with a plan that said, here, I want to spend $7 or $8 trillion, and then we\'92re going
###1939 to pay for it, but we can\'92t tell you until maybe after the election how we\'92re going
###1944 to do it, you wouldn\'92t take such a sketchy deal and neither should you, the American
###1950 people, because the math doesn\'92t add up.\ And -- and what\'92s at stake here is one
###1956 of two things, either Candy -- this blows up the deficit because keep in mind, this
###1962 is just to pay for the additional spending that he\'92s talking about, $7 trillion - $8
###1968 trillion before we even get to the deficit we already have. Or, alternatively, it\'92s
###1973 got to be paid for, not only by closing deductions for wealthy individuals, that -- that will
###1978 pay for about 4 percent reduction in tax rates.\ You\'92re going to be paying for it. You\'92re
###1983 going to lose some deductions, and you can\'92t buy the sales pitch. Nobody who\'92s looked
###1988 at it that\'92s serious, actually believes it adds up.\
###1991 CROWLEY: Mr. President, let me get -- let me get the governor in on this. And Governor,
###1995 let\'92s -- before we get into a...\ ROMNEY: I -- I...\
###1997 CROWLEY: ...vast array of who says -- what study says what, if it shouldn\'92t add up.
###2003 If somehow when you get in there, there isn\'92t enough tax revenue coming in. If somehow the
###2008 numbers don\'92t add up, would you be willing to look again at a 20 percent...\
###2013 ROMNEY: Well of course they add up. I -- I was -- I was someone who ran businesses for
###2020 25 years, and balanced the budget. I ran the Olympics and balanced the budget. I ran the
###2026 -- the state of Massachusetts as a governor, to the extent any governor does, and balanced
###2031 the budget all four years. When we\'92re talking about math that doesn\'92t add up, how about
###2036 $4 trillion of deficits over the last four years, $5 trillion? That\'92s math that doesn\'92t
###2041 add up. We have -- we have a president talking about someone\'92s plan in a way that\'92s
###2047 completely foreign to what my real plan is.\ ROMNEY: And then we have his own record, which
###2053 is we have four consecutive years where he said when he was running for office, he would
###2058 cut the deficit in half. Instead he\'92s doubled it. We\'92ve gone from $10 trillion of national
###2063 debt, to $16 trillion of national debt. If the president were reelected, we\'92d go to
###2069 almost $20 trillion of national debt. This puts us on a road to Greece. I know what it
###2075 takes to balance budgets. I\'92ve done it my entire life. So for instance when he says,
###2079 \'93Yours is a $5 trillion cut.\'94 Well, no it\'92s not. Because I\'92m offsetting
###2084 some of the reductions with holding down some of the deductions.\
###2087 And...\ CROWLEY: Governor, I\'92ve gotta -- gotta
###2089 -- actually, I need to have you both (inaudible).\ (CROSSTALK)\
###2090 CROWLEY: I understand the stakes here. I understand both of you. But I -- I will get run out of
###2095 town if I don\'92t...\ (CROSSTALK)\
###2096 ROMNEY: And I just described -- I just described to you, Mr. President -- I just described
###2098 to you precisely how I\'92d do it which is with a single number that people can put -- and
###2102 they can put they\'92re -- they\'92re deductions and credits...\
###2105 (CROSSTALK)\ CROWLEY: Mr. President, we\'92re keeping track,
###2107 I promise you. And Mr. President, the next question is for you, so stay standing.\
###2111 OBAMA: Great. Looking forward to it.\ And it\'92s Katherine Fenton, who has a question
###2114 for you.\ QUESTION: In what new ways to you intend to
###2121 rectify the inequalities in the workplace, specifically regarding females making only
###2126 72 percent of what their male counterparts earn?\
###2129 OBAMA: Well, Katherine, that\'92s a great question. And, you know, I was raised by a
###2134 single mom who had to put herself through school while looking after two kids. And she
###2143 worked hard every day and made a lot of sacrifices to make sure we got everything we needed.
###2148 My grandmother, she started off as a secretary in a bank. She never got a college education,
###2156 even though she was smart as a whip. And she worked her way up to become a vice president
###2160 of a local bank, but she hit the glass ceiling. She trained people who would end up becoming
###2168 her bosses during the course of her career.\ She didn\'92t complain. That\'92s not what
###2172 you did in that generation. And this is one of the reasons why one of the first -- the
###2179 first bill I signed was something called the Lily Ledbetter bill. And it\'92s named after
###2185 this amazing woman who had been doing the same job as a man for years, found out that
###2192 she was getting paid less, and the Supreme Court said that she couldn\'92t bring suit
###2197 because she should have found about it earlier, whereas she had no way of finding out about
###2201 it. So we fixed that. And that\'92s an example of the kind of advocacy that we need, because
###2208 women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family. This is not just a women\'92s
###2216 issue, this is a family issue, this is a middle-class issue, and that\'92s why we\'92ve got to fight
###2220 for it.\ It also means that we\'92ve got to make sure
###2224 that young people like yourself are able to afford a college education. Earlier, Governor
###2228 Romney talked about he wants to make Pell Grants and other education accessible for
###2234 young people.\ Well, the truth of the matter is, is that
###2237 that\'92s exactly what we\'92ve done. We\'92ve expanded Pell Grants for millions of people,
###2241 including millions of young women, all across the country.\
###2243 We did it by taking $60 billion that was going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the
###2250 student loan program, and we said, let\'92s just cut out the middleman. Let\'92s give
###2254 the money directly to students.\ And as a consequence, we\'92ve seen millions
###2258 of young people be able to afford college, and that\'92s going to make sure that young
###2262 women are going to be able to compete in that marketplace.\
###2264 But we\'92ve got to enforce the laws, which is what we are doing, and we\'92ve also got
###2269 to make sure that in every walk of life we do not tolerate discrimination.\
###2274 That\'92s been one of the hallmarks of my administration. I\'92m going to continue to
###2279 push on this issue for the next four years.\ CROWLEY: Governor Romney, pay equity for women?\
###2284 ROMNEY: Thank you. And important topic, and one which I learned a great deal about, particularly
###2290 as I was serving as governor of my state, because I had the chance to pull together
###2295 a cabinet and all the applicants seemed to be men.\
###2300 And I -- and I went to my staff, and I said, \'93How come all the people for these jobs
###2303 are -- are all men.\'94 They said, \'93Well, these are the people that have the qualifications.\'94
###2305 And I said, \'93Well, gosh, can\'92t we -- can\'92t we find some -- some women that are also qualified?\'94\
###2310 ROMNEY: And -- and so we -- we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds
###2316 that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet.\
###2319 I went to a number of women\'92s groups and said, \'93Can you help us find folks,\'94
###2322 and they brought us whole binders full of women.\
###2325 I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University
###2330 of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states, and concluded that mine had more
###2336 women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America.\
###2340 Now one of the reasons I was able to get so many good women to be part of that team was
###2343 because of our recruiting effort. But number two, because I recognized that if you\'92re
###2347 going to have women in the workforce that sometimes you need to be more flexible. My
###2351 chief of staff, for instance, had two kids that were still in school.\
###2354 She said, I can\'92t be here until 7 or 8 o\'92clock at night. I need to be able to
###2358 get home at 5 o\'92clock so I can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with
###2363 them when they get home from school. So we said fine. Let\'92s have a flexible schedule
###2367 so you can have hours that work for you.\ We\'92re going to have to have employers in
###2371 the new economy, in the economy I\'92m going to bring to play, that are going to be so
###2376 anxious to get good workers they\'92re going to be anxious to hire women. In the -- in
###2379 the last women have lost 580,000 jobs. That\'92s the net of what\'92s happened in the last
###2386 four years. We\'92re still down 580,000 jobs. I mentioned 31/2 million women, more now in
###2393 poverty than four years ago.\ What we can do to help young women and women
###2398 of all ages is to have a strong economy, so strong that employers that are looking to
###2403 find good employees and bringing them into their workforce and adapting to a flexible
###2409 work schedule that gives women opportunities that they would otherwise not be able to afford.\
###2414 This is what I have done. It\'92s what I look forward to doing and I know what it takes
###2419 to make an economy work, and I know what a working economy looks like. And an economy
###2424 with 7.8 percent unemployment is not a real strong economy. An economy that has 23 million
###2431 people looking for work is not a strong economy.\ An economy with 50 percent of kids graduating
###2437 from college that can\'92t finds a job, or a college level job, that\'92s not what we
###2442 have to have. CROWLEY: Governor?\ ROMNEY: I\'92m going to help women in America
###2445 get good work by getting a stronger economy and by supporting women in the workforce.\
###2449 CROWLEY: Mr. President why don\'92t you get in on this quickly, please?\
###2451 OBAMA: Katherine, I just want to point out that when Governor Romney\'92s campaign was
###2455 asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it? He said, \'93I\'92ll get
###2460 back to you.\'94 And that\'92s not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy.
###2465 Now, there are some other issues that have a bearing on how women succeed in the workplace.
###2472 For example, their healthcare. You know a major difference in this campaign is that
###2480 Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices
###2487 that women are making.\ I think that\'92s a mistake. In my health
###2491 care bill, I said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody
###2498 who is insured. Because this is not just a -- a health issue, it\'92s an economic issue
###2503 for women. It makes a difference. This is money out of that family\'92s pocket. Governor
###2510 Romney not only opposed it, he suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the
###2515 decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.\
###2521 That\'92s not the kind of advocacy that women need. When Governor Romney says that we should
###2528 eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, there are millions of women all across the
###2534 country, who rely on Planned Parenthood for, not just contraceptive care, they rely on
###2538 it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings. That\'92s a pocketbook issue for women and
###2545 families all across the country. And it makes a difference in terms of how well and effectively
###2550 women are able to work. When we talk about child care, and the credits that we\'92re
###2557 providing. That makes a difference in whether they can go out there and -- and earn a living
###2561 for their family.\ These are not just women\'92s issues. These
###2566 are family issues. These are economic issues.\ And one of the things that makes us grow as
###2572 an economy is when everybody participates and women are getting the same fair deal as
###2578 men are.\ CROWLEY: Mr. President...\
###2578 OBAMA: And I\'92ve got two daughters and I want to make sure that they have the same
###2582 opportunities that anybody\'92s sons have. That\'92s part of what I\'92m fighting for
###2588 as president of the United States.\ CROWLEY: I want to move us along here to Susan
###2590 Katz, who has a question.\ And, Governor, it\'92s for you. QUESTION:
###2598 Governor Romney, I am an undecided voter, because I\'92m disappointed with the lack
###2603 of progress I\'92ve seen in the last four years. However, I do attribute much of America\'92s
###2610 economic and international problems to the failings and missteps of the Bush administration.\
###2617 Since both you and President Bush are Republicans, I fear a return to the policies of those years
###2625 should you win this election. What is the biggest difference between you and George
###2631 W. Bush, and how do you differentiate yourself from George W. Bush?\
###2637 ROMNEY: Thank you. And I appreciate that question.\ I just want to make sure that, I think I was
###2642 supposed to get that last answer, but I want to point out that that I don\'92t believe...\
###2646 OBAMA: I don\'92t think so, Candy.\ ROMNEY: ... I don\'92t believe...\
###2647 OBAMA: I want to make sure our timekeepers are working here.\
###2650 ROMNEY: The time -- the time...\ CROWLEY: OK. The timekeepers are all working.
###2652 And let me tell you that the last part, it\'92s for the two of you to talk to one another,
###2657 and it isn\'92t quite as (inaudible) you think.\ But go ahead and use this two minutes any
###2661 way you\'92d like to, the question is on the floor.\
###2663 ROMNEY: I\'92d just note that I don\'92t believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell
###2667 someone whether they can use contraceptives or not. And I don\'92t believe employers should
###2671 tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care of not. Every woman in America should
###2675 have access to contraceptives. And -- and the -- and the president\'92s statement of
###2679 my policy is completely and totally wrong.\ OBAMA: Governor...\
###2681 ROMNEY: Let me come back and -- and answer your question.\
###2685 President Bush and I are -- are different people and these are different times and that\'92s
###2689 why my five point plan is so different than what he would have done.\
###2692 I mean for instance, we can now, by virtue of new technology actually get all the energy
###2697 we need in North America without having to go to the -- the Arabs or the Venezuelans
###2702 or anyone else. That wasn\'92t true in his time, that\'92s why my policy starts with
###2706 a very robust policy to get all that energy in North America -- become energy secure.\
###2711 Number two, trade -- I\'92ll crack down on China, President Bush didn\'92t. I\'92m also
###2716 going to dramatically expand trade in Latin America. It\'92s been growing about 12 percent
###2720 per year over a long period of time. I want to add more free trade agreements so we\'92ll
###2724 have more trade.\ Number three, I\'92m going to get us to a
###2727 balanced budget. President Bush didn\'92t. President Obama was right, he said that that
###2732 was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years.
###2737 He was right, but then he put in place deficits twice that size for every one of his four
###2742 years. And his forecast for the next four years is more deficits, almost that large.
###2748 So that\'92s the next area I\'92m different than President Bush.\
###2750 And then let\'92s take the last one, championing small business. Our party has been focused
###2755 too long. I came through small business. I understand how hard it is to start a small
###2761 business. That\'92s why everything I\'92ll do is designed to help small businesses grow
###2766 and add jobs. I want to keep their taxes down on small business. I want regulators to see
###2772 their job as encouraging small enterprise, not crushing it.\
###2777 And the thing I find the most troubling about Obama Care, well it\'92s a long list, but
###2781 one of the things I find most troubling is that when you go out and talk to small businesses
###2785 and ask them what they think about it, they tell you it keeps them from hiring more people.\
###2790 My priority is jobs. I know how to make that happen. And President Bush has a very different
###2795 path for a very different time. My path is designed in getting small businesses to grow
###2801 and hire people.\ CROWLEY: Thanks, Governor.\
###2805 Mr. President?\ OBAMA: Well, first of all, I think it\'92s
###2809 important to tell you that we did come in during some tough times. We were losing 800,000
###2815 jobs a month when I started. But we had been digging our way out of policies that were
###2822 misplaced and focused on the top doing very well and middle class folks not doing well.\
###2829 Now, we\'92ve seen 30 consecutive -- 31 consecutive months of job growth; 5.2 million new jobs
###2835 created. And the plans that I talked about will create even more. But when Governor Romney
###2842 says that he has a very different economic plan, the centerpiece of his economic plan
###2847 are tax cuts. That\'92s what took us from surplus to deficit. When he talks about getting
###2854 tough on China, keep in mind that Governor Romney invested in companies that were pioneers
###2862 of outsourcing to China, and is currently investing in countries -- in companies that
###2870 are building surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks.\
###2875 That\'92s -- Governor, you\'92re the last person who\'92s going to get tough on China.
###2878 And what we\'92ve done when it comes to trade is not only sign three trade deals to open
###2884 up new markets, but we\'92ve also set up a task force for trade that goes after anybody
###2890 who is taking advantage of American workers or businesses and not creating a level playing
###2893 field. We\'92ve brought twice as many cases against unfair trading practices than the
###2900 previous administration and we\'92ve won every single one that\'92s been decided.\
###2904 When I said that we had to make sure that China was not flooding our domestic market
###2910 with cheap tires, Governor Romney said I was being protectionist; that it wouldn\'92t be
###2915 helpful to American workers. Well, in fact we saved 1,000 jobs. And that\'92s the kind
###2919 of tough trade actions that are required.\ But the last point I want to make is this.
###2926 You know, there are some things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush. George
###2930 Bush didn\'92t propose turning Medicare into a voucher. George Bush embraced comprehensive
###2938 immigration reform. He didn\'92t call for self-deportation.\
###2941 George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, so there are
###2950 differences between Governor Romney and George Bush, but they\'92re not on economic policy.
###2956 In some ways, he\'92s gone to a more extreme place when it comes to social policy. And
###2960 I think that\'92s a mistake. That\'92s not how we\'92re going to move our economy forward.\
###2964 CROWLEY: I want to move you both along to the next question, because it\'92s in the
###2967 same wheelhouse, so you will be able to respond. But the president does get this question.
###2972 I want to call on Michael Jones.\ QUESTION: Mr. President, I voted for you in
###2982 2008. What have you done or accomplished to earn my vote in 2012? I\'92m not that optimistic
###2987 as I was in 2012. Most things I need for everyday living are very expensive.\
###2994 OBAMA: Well, we\'92ve gone through a tough four years. There\'92s no doubt about it.
###2999 But four years ago, I told the American people and I told you I would cut taxes for middle
###3004 class families. And I did. I told you I\'92d cut taxes for small businesses, and I have.\
###3010 I said that I\'92d end the war in Iraq, and I did. I said we\'92d refocus attention on
###3015 those who actually attacked us on 9/11, and we have gone after Al Qaeda\'92s leadership
###3021 like never before and Osama bin Laden is dead.\ OBAMA: I said that we would put in place health
###3027 care reform to make sure that insurance companies can\'92t jerk you around and if you don\'92t
###3031 have health insurance, that you\'92d have a chance to get affordable insurance, and
###3034 I have.\ I committed that I would rein in the excesses
###3038 of Wall Street, and we passed the toughest Wall Street reforms since the 1930s. We\'92ve
###3045 created five million jobs, and gone from 800 jobs a month being lost, and we are making
###3050 progress. We saved an auto industry that was on the brink of collapse.\
###3054 Now, does that mean you\'92re not struggling? Absolutely not. A lot of us are. And that\'92s
###3061 why the plan that I\'92ve put forward for manufacturing and education, and reducing
###3066 our deficit in a sensible way, using the savings from ending wars, to rebuild America and putting
###3072 people back to work. Making sure that we are controlling our own energy, but not only the
###3079 energy of today, but also the energy of the future. All of those things will make a difference,
###3082 so the point is the commitments I\'92ve made, I\'92ve kept.\
###3088 And those that I haven\'92t been able to keep, it\'92s not for lack of trying and we\'92re
###3091 going to get it done in a second term. But, you should pay attention to this campaign,
###3096 because Governor Romney has made some commitments as well. And I suspect he\'92ll keep those
###3101 too. You know when members of the Republican Congress say, \'93We\'92re going to sign a
###3106 no tax pledge, so that we don\'92t ask a dime for millionaires and billionaires to reduce
###3112 our deficit so we can still invest in education, and helping kids go to college. He said, \'93Me
###3120 too.\'94\ When they said, \'93We\'92re going to cut
###3123 Planned Parenthood funding.\'94 He said, \'93Me too.\'94 When he said, \'93We\'92re going
###3127 to repeal Obamacare. First thing I\'92m going to do,\'94 despite the fact that it\'92s the
###3131 same health care plan that he passed in Massachusetts and is working well. He said, \'93Me too.\'94
###3138 That is not the kind of leadership that you need, but you should expect that those are
###3142 promises he\'92s going to keep.\ (CROSSTALK)\
###3144 CROWLEY: Mr. President, let me let...\ (CROSSTALK)\
###3145 OBAMA: ...the choice in this election is going to be whose promises are going to be more
###3147 likely to help you in your life? Make sure your kids can go to college. Make sure that
###3153 you are getting a good paying job, making sure that Medicare and Social Security...
###3156 (CROSSTALK)\ CROWLEY: Mr. President. Thank you.\
###3156 (CROSSTALK)\ OBAMA: ...will be there for you.\
###3157 CROWLEY: Thank you. Governor?\ ROMNEY: I think you know better. I think you
###3164 know that these last four years haven\'92t been so good as the president just described
###3168 and that you don\'92t feel like your confident that the next four years are going to be much
###3171 better either.\ I can tell you that if you were to elect President
###3175 Obama, you know what you\'92re going to get. You\'92re going to get a repeat of the last
###3178 four years. We just can\'92t afford four more years like the last four years.\
###3183 He said that by now we\'92d have unemployment at 5.4 percent. The difference between where
###3189 it is and 5.4 percent is 9 million Americans without work.\
###3195 I wasn\'92t the one that said 5.4 percent. This was the president\'92s plan. Didn\'92t
###3199 get there.\ He said he would have by now put forward a
###3203 plan to reform Medicare and Social Security, because he pointed out they\'92re on the road
###3207 to bankruptcy. He would reform them. He\'92d get that done. He hasn\'92t even made a proposal
###3213 on either one.\ He said in his first year he\'92d put out
###3216 an immigration plan that would deal with our immigration challenges. Didn\'92t even file
###3221 it.\ This is a president who has not been able
###3224 to do what he said he\'92d do. He said that he\'92d cut in half the deficit. He hasn\'92t
###3228 done that either. In fact, he doubled it. He said that by now middle-income families
###3233 would have a reduction in their health insurance premiums by $2,500 a year. It\'92s gone up
###3240 by $2,500 a year. And if Obamacare is passed, or implemented -- it\'92s already been passed
###3246 -- if it\'92s implemented fully, it\'92ll be another $2,500 on top.\
###3250 ROMNEY: The middle class is getting crushed under the policies of a president who has
###3255 not understood what it takes to get the economy working again. He keeps saying, \'93Look,
###3259 I\'92ve created 5 million jobs.\'94 That\'92s after losing 5 million jobs. The entire record
###3264 is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country. The unemployment,
###3269 the number of people who are still looking for work, is still 23 million Americans.\
###3273 There are more people in poverty, one out of six people in poverty.\
###3277 How about food stamps? When he took office, 32 million people were on food stamps. Today,
###3283 47 million people are on food stamps. How about the growth of the economy? It\'92s growing
###3288 more slowly this year than last year, and more slowly last year than the year before.\
###3295 The president wants to do well. I understand. But the policies he\'92s put in place from
###3300 Obamacare to Dodd-Frank to his tax policies to his regulatory policies, these policies
###3306 combined have not let this economy take off and grow like it could have.\
###3310 You might say, \'93Well, you got an example of one that worked better?\'94 Yeah, in the
###3314 Reagan recession where unemployment hit 10.8 percent, between that period -- the end of
###3320 that recession and the equivalent of time to today, Ronald Reagan\'92s recovery created
###3325 twice as many jobs as this president\'92s recovery. Five million jobs doesn\'92t even
###3330 keep up with our population growth. And the only reason the unemployment rate seems a
###3334 little lower today is because of all the people that have dropped out of the workforce.\
###3339 The president has tried, but his policies haven\'92t worked. He\'92s great as a -- as
###3345 a -- as a speaker and describing his plans and his vision. That\'92s wonderful, except
###3350 we have a record to look at. And that record shows he just hasn\'92t been able to cut the
###3356 deficit, to put in place reforms for Medicare and Social Security to preserve them, to get
###3361 us the rising incomes we need. Median income is down $4,300 a family and 23 million Americans
###3368 out of work. That\'92s what this election is about. It\'92s about who can get the middle
###3373 class in this country a bright and prosperous future and assure our kids the kind of hope
###3378 and optimism they deserve.\ CROWLEY: Governor, I want to move you along.
###3380 Don\'92t -- don\'92t go away, and we\'92ll have plenty of time to respond. We are quite
###3384 aware of the clock for both of you. But I want to bring in a different subject here.\
###3388 Mr. President, I\'92ll be right back with you.\
###3392 Lorraine Osorio has a question for you about a topic we have not...\
###3395 OBAMA: This is for Governor Romney?\ CROWLEY: It\'92s for Governor Romney, and
###3397 we\'92ll be right with you, Mr. President. Thanks.\
###3399 ROMNEY: Is it Loraina?\ QUESTION: Lorraine.\
###3401 ROMNEY: Lorraine?\ QUESTION: Yes, Lorraine.\
###3403 ROMNEY: Lorraine.\ QUESTION: How you doing?\
###3406 ROMNEY: Good, thanks.\ QUESTION: Mr. Romney, what do you plan on
###3409 doing with immigrants without their green cards that are currently living here as productive
###3414 members of society?\ ROMNEY: Thank you. Lorraine? Did I get that
###3418 right? Good. Thank you for your question. And let me step back and tell you what I would
###3423 like to do with our immigration policy broadly and include an answer to your question.\
###3427 But first of all, this is a nation of immigrants. We welcome people coming to this country as
###3433 immigrants. My dad was born in Mexico of American parents; Ann\'92s dad was born in Wales and
###3437 is a first-generation American. We welcome legal immigrants into this country.\
###3442 I want our legal system to work better. I want it to be streamlined. I want it to be
###3447 clearer. I don\'92t think you have to -- shouldn\'92t have to hire a lawyer to figure out how to
###3451 get into this country legally. I also think that we should give visas to people -- green
###3455 cards, rather, to people who graduate with skills that we need. People around the world
###3460 with accredited degrees in science and math get a green card stapled to their diploma,
###3465 come to the U.S. of A. We should make sure our legal system works.\
###3469 Number two, we\'92re going to have to stop illegal immigration. There are 4 million people
###3474 who are waiting in line to get here legally. Those who\'92ve come here illegally take their
###3478 place. So I will not grant amnesty to those who have come here illegally.\
###3482 What I will do is I\'92ll put in place an employment verification system and make sure
###3486 that employers that hire people who have come here illegally are sanctioned for doing so.
###3490 I won\'92t put in place magnets for people coming here illegally. So for instance, I
###3495 would not give driver\'92s licenses to those that have come here illegally as the president
###3499 would.\ The kids of those that came here illegally,
###3504 those kids, I think, should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the United
###3508 States and military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway
###3512 to become a permanent resident.\ ROMNEY: Now when the president ran for office,
###3516 he said that he\'92d put in place, in his first year, a piece of legislation -- he\'92d
###3520 file a bill in his first year that would reform our -- our immigration system, protect legal
###3525 immigration, stop illegal immigration. He didn\'92t do it.\
###3528 He had a Democrat House, a Democrat Senate, super majority in both Houses. Why did he
###3534 fail to even promote legislation that would have provided an answer for those that want
###3540 to come legally and for those that are here illegally today? What\'92s a question I think
###3545 the -- the president will have a chance to answer right now.\
###3547 OBAMA: Good, I look forward to it.\ Was -- Lorranna -- Lorraine -- we are a nation
###3555 of immigrants. I mean we\'92re just a few miles away from Ellis Island. We all understand
###3562 what this country has become because talent from all around the world wants to come here.
###3569 People are willing to take risks. People who want to build on their dreams and make sure
###3574 their kids have an even bigger dreams than they have.\
###3576 But we\'92re also a nation of laws. So what I\'92ve said is we need to fix a broken immigration
###3583 system and I\'92ve done everything that I can on my own and sought cooperation from
###3589 Congress to make sure that we fix the system.\ The first thing we did was to streamline the
###3594 legal immigration system, to reduce the backlog, make it easier, simpler and cheaper for people
###3599 who are waiting in line, obeying the law to make sure that they can come here and contribute
###3604 to our country and that\'92s good for our economic growth.\
###3607 They\'92ll start new businesses. They\'92ll make things happen to create jobs here in
###3612 the United States.\ Number two, we do have to deal with our border
###3616 so we put more border patrol on the -- any time in history and the flow of undocumented
###3622 works across the border is actually lower than it\'92s been in 40 years.\
###3626 What I\'92ve also said is if we\'92re going to go after folks who are here illegally,
###3631 we should do it smartly and go after folks who are criminals, gang bangers, people who
###3636 are hurting the community, not after students, not after folks who are here just because
###3642 they\'92re trying to figure out how to feed their families. And that\'92s what we\'92ve
###3646 done. And what I\'92ve also said is for young people who come here, brought here often times
###3652 by their parents. Had gone to school here, pledged allegiance to the flag. Think of this
###3659 as their country. Understand themselves as Americans in every way except having papers.
###3664 And we should make sure that we give them a pathway to citizenship.\
###3668 And that\'92s what I\'92ve done administratively. Now, Governor Romney just said, you know he
###3673 wants to help those young people too, but during the Republican primary, he said, \'93I
###3678 will veto the DREAM Act\'94, that would allow these young people to have access.\'94 His
###3685 main strategy during the Republican primary was to say, \'93We\'92re going to encourage
###3689 self-deportation.\'94 Making life so miserable on folks that they\'92ll leave. He called
###3696 the Arizona law a model for the nation. Part of the Arizona law said that law enforcement
###3701 officers could stop folks because they suspected maybe they looked like they might be undocumented
###3705 workers and check their papers.\ You know what? If my daughter or yours looks
###3715 to somebody like they\'92re not a citizen, I don\'92t want -- I don\'92t want to empower
###3721 somebody like that. So, we can fix this system in a comprehensive way. And when Governor
###3730 Romney says, the challenge is, \'93Well Obama didn\'92t try.\'94 That\'92s not true. I have
###3736 sat down with Democrats and Republicans at the beginning of my term. And I said, let\'92s
###3740 fix this system. Including Senators previously who had supported it on the Republican side.
###3745 But it\'92s very hard for Republican\'92s in Congress to support comprehensive immigration
###3750 reform, if their standard bearer has said that, this is not something I\'92m interested
###3756 in supporting.\ CROWLEY: Let me get the governor in here,
###3758 Mr. President. Let\'92s speak to, if you could...\ ROMNEY: Yes.\
###3761 CROWLEY: ...the idea of self-deportation?\ ROMNEY: No, let -- let -- let me go back and
###3764 speak to the points that the president made and -- and -- and let\'92s get them correct.\
###3769 I did not say that the Arizona law was a model for the nation in that aspect. I said that
###3774 the E-Verify portion of the Arizona law, which is -- which is the portion of the law which
###3779 says that employers could be able to determine whether someone is here illegally or not illegally,
###3784 that that was a model for the nation. That\'92s number one.\
###3786 Number two, I asked the president a question I think Hispanics and immigrants all over
###3790 the nation have asked. He was asked this on Univision the other day. Why, when you said
###3795 you\'92d filed legislation in your first year didn\'92t you do it? And he didn\'92t answer.
###3799 He -- he doesn\'92t answer that question. He said the standard bearer wasn\'92t for
###3803 it.\ I\'92m glad you thought I was a standard bearer
###3805 four years ago, but I wasn\'92t.\ Four years ago you said in your first year
###3810 you would file legislation.\ In his first year, I was just getting -- licking
###3815 my wounds from having been beaten by John McCain, all right. I was not the standard
###3818 bearer.\ My -- my view is that this president should
###3821 have honored his promise to do as he said.\ Now, let me mention one other thing, and that
###3825 is self-deportation says let people make their own choice. What I was saying is, we\'92re
###3830 not going to round up 12 million people, undocumented illegals, and take them out of the nation.
###3836 Instead let people make their own choice. And if they -- if they find that -- that they
###3840 can\'92t get the benefits here that they want and they can\'92t -- and they can\'92t find
###3843 the job they want, then they\'92ll make a decision to go a place where -- where they
###3847 have better opportunities.\ But I\'92m not in favor of rounding up people
###3850 and -- and -- and taking them out of this country. I am in favor, as the president has
###3855 said, and I agree with him, which is that if people have committed crimes we got to
###3858 get them out of this country.\ ROMNEY: Let me mention something else the
###3860 president said. It was a moment ago and I didn\'92t get a chance to, when he was describing
###3865 Chinese investments and so forth.\ OBAMA: Candy?\
###3868 Hold on a second. The...\ ROMNEY: Mr. President, I\'92m still speaking.\
###3871 (CROSSTALK)\ ROMNEY: Mr. President, let me finish.\
###3874 (CROSSTALK)\ ROMNEY: I\'92ve gotta continue.\
###3876 (CROSSTALK)\ CROWLEY: Governor Romney, you can make it
###3880 short. See all these people? They\'92ve been waiting for you. (inaudible) make it short
###3883 (inaudible).\ ROMNEY: Just going to make a point. Any investments
###3885 I have over the last eight years have been managed by a blind trust. And I understand
###3889 they do include investments outside the United States, including in -- in Chinese companies.\
###3894 Mr. President, have you looked at your pension? Have you looked at your pension?\
###3896 OBAMA: I\'92ve got to say...\ ROMNEY: Mr. President, have you looked at
###3899 your pension?\ OBAMA: You know, I -- I don\'92t look at my
###3902 pension. It\'92s not as big as yours so it doesn\'92t take as long.\
###3904 ROMNEY: Well, let me give you some advice.\ OBAMA: I don\'92t check it that often.\
###3907 ROMNEY: Let me give you some advice. Look at your pension. You also have investments
###3910 in Chinese companies. You also have investments outside the United States. You also have investments
###3914 through a Cayman\'92s trust.\ (CROSSTALK)\
###3916 CROWLEY: We\'92re way off topic here, Governor Romney.\
###3918 (CROSSTALK)\ OBAMA: I thought we were talking about immigration.\
###3921 (CROSSTALK)\ OBAMA: I do want to make sure that...\
###3925 CROWLEY: If I could have you sit down, Governor Romney. Thank you.\
###3927 OBAMA: I do want to make sure that -- I do want to make sure that we just understand
###3929 something. Governor Romney says he wasn\'92t referring to Arizona as a model for the nation.
###3934 His top adviser on immigration is the guy who designed the Arizona law, the entirety
###3938 of it; not E-Verify, the whole thing. That\'92s his policy. And it\'92s a bad policy. And
###3944 it won\'92t help us grow.\ Look, when we think about immigration, we
###3951 have to understand there are folks all around the world who still see America as the land
###3957 of promise. And they provide us energy and they provide us innovation and they start
###3963 companies like Intel and Google. And we want to encourage that.\
###3967 Now, we\'92ve got to make sure that we do it in a smart way and a comprehensive way,
###3972 and we make the legal system better. But when we make this into a divisive political issue,
###3980 and when we don\'92t have bipartisan support -- I can deliver, Governor, a whole bunch
###3984 of Democrats to get comprehensive immigration reform done, and we can\'92t...\
###3987 ROMNEY: I\'92ll get it done. I\'92ll get it done. First year...\
###3989 OBAMA: ... we can\'92t -- we have not seen Republicans serious about this issue at all.
###3993 And it\'92s time for them to get serious on it.\
###3995 CROWLEY: Mr. President, let me move you on here please. Mr. President, (inaudible).\
###3996 OBAMA: This used to be a bipartisan issue.\ (CROSSTALK)\
###3997 CROWLEY: Don\'92t go away, though -- right. Don\'92t go away because I -- I want you to
###4000 talk to Kerry Ladka who wants to switch the topic for us.\
###4005 OBAMA: OK.\ Hi, Kerry.\
###4008 QUESTION: Good evening, Mr. President.\ OBAMA: I\'92m sorry. What\'92s your name?\
###4013 QUESTION: It\'92s Kerry, Kerry Ladka.\ OBAMA: Great to see you.\
###4014 QUESTION: This question actually comes from a brain trust of my friends at Global Telecom
###4019 Supply (ph) in Minneola yesterday.\ OBAMA: Ah.\
###4021 QUESTION: We were sitting around, talking about Libya, and we were reading and became
###4025 aware of reports that the State Department refused extra security for our embassy in
###4032 Benghazi, Libya, prior to the attacks that killed four Americans.\
###4037 Who was it that denied enhanced security and why?\
###4041 OBAMA: Well, let me first of all talk about our diplomats, because they serve all around
###4047 the world and do an incredible job in a very dangerous situation. And these aren\'92t just
###4054 representatives of the United States, they are my representatives. I send them there,
###4058 oftentimes into harm\'92s way. I know these folks and I know their families. So nobody
###4064 is more concerned about their safety and security than I am.\
###4068 So as soon as we found out that the Benghazi consulate was being overrun, I was on the
###4073 phone with my national security team and I gave them three instructions.\
###4077 Number one, beef up our security and procedures, not just in Libya, but at every embassy and
###4085 consulate in the region.\ Number two, investigate exactly what happened,
###4090 regardless of where the facts lead us, to make sure folks are held accountable and it
###4096 doesn\'92t happen again.\ And number three, we are going to find out
###4100 who did this and we\'92re going to hunt them down, because one of the things that I\'92ve
###4104 said throughout my presidency is when folks mess with Americans, we go after them.\
###4110 OBAMA: Now Governor Romney had a very different response. While we were still dealing with
###4116 our diplomats being threatened, Governor Romney put out a press release, trying to make political
###4123 points, and that\'92s not how a commander in chief operates. You don\'92t turn national
###4131 security into a political issue. Certainly not right when it\'92s happening. And people
###4137 -- not everybody agrees with some of the decisions I\'92ve made. But when it comes to our national
###4141 security, I mean what I say. I said I\'92d end the war in Libya -- in -- in Iraq, and
###4147 I did.\ I said that we\'92d go after al-Qaeda and
###4151 bin Laden, we have. I said we\'92d transition out of Afghanistan, and start making sure
###4157 that Afghans are responsible for their own security, that\'92s what I\'92m doing. And
###4162 when it comes to this issue, when I say that we are going to find out exactly what happened,
###4168 everybody will be held accountable. And I am ultimately responsible for what\'92s taking
###4173 place there because these are my folks, and I\'92m the one who has to greet those coffins
###4178 when they come home. You know that I mean what I say.\
###4182 CROWLEY: Mr. President, I\'92m going to move us along. Governor?\
###4185 ROMNEY: Thank you Kerry for your question, it\'92s an important one. And -- and I -- I
###4190 think the president just said correctly that the buck does stop at his desk and -- and
###4195 he takes responsibility for -- for that -- for the failure in providing those security resources,
###4201 and -- and those terrible things may well happen from time to time. I -- I\'92m -- I
###4205 feel very deeply sympathetic for the families of those who lost loved ones. And today there\'92s
###4210 a memorial service for one of those that was lost in this tragedy. We -- we think of their
###4214 families and care for them deeply. There were other issues associated with this -- with
###4219 this tragedy. There were many days that passed before we knew whether this was a spontaneous
###4225 demonstration, or actually whether it was a terrorist attack.\
###4228 ROMNEY: And there was no demonstration involved. It was a terrorist attack and it took a long
###4233 time for that to be told to the American people. Whether there was some misleading, or instead
###4239 whether we just didn\'92t know what happened, you have to ask yourself why didn\'92t we
###4242 know five days later when the ambassador to the United Nations went on TV to say that
###4247 this was a demonstration. How could we have not known?\
###4250 But I find more troubling than this, that on -- on the day following the assassination
###4255 of the United States ambassador, the first time that\'92s happened since 1979, when -- when
###4261 we have four Americans killed there, when apparently we didn\'92t know what happened,
###4265 that the president, the day after that happened, flies to Las Vegas for a political fund-raiser,
###4270 then the next day to Colorado for another event, other political event.\
###4275 I think these -- these actions taken by a president and a leader have symbolic significance
###4281 and perhaps even material significance in that you\'92d hope that during that time we
###4285 could call in the people who were actually eyewitnesses. We\'92ve read their accounts
###4289 now about what happened. It was very clear this was not a demonstration. This was an
###4293 attack by terrorists.\ And this calls into question the president\'92s
###4298 whole policy in the Middle East. Look what\'92s happening in Syria, in Egypt, now in Libya.
###4304 Consider the distance between ourselves and -- and Israel, the president said that -- that
###4308 he was going to put daylight between us and Israel.\
###4311 We have Iran four years closer to a nuclear bomb. Syria -- Syria\'92s not just a tragedy
###4316 of 30,000 civilians being killed by a military, but also a strategic -- strategically significant
###4323 player for America.\ The president\'92s policies throughout the
###4326 Middle East began with an apology tour and -- and -- and pursue a strategy of leading
###4331 from behind, and this strategy is unraveling before our very eyes.\
###4335 CROWLEY: Because we\'92re -- we\'92re closing in, I want to still get a lot of people in.
###4339 I want to ask you something, Mr. President, and then have the governor just quickly.\
###4344 Your secretary of state, as I\'92m sure you know, has said that she takes full responsibility
###4349 for the attack on the diplomatic mission in Benghazi. Does the buck stop with your secretary
###4354 of state as far as what went on here?\ OBAMA: Secretary Clinton has done an extraordinary
###4358 job. But she works for me. I\'92m the president and I\'92m always responsible, and that\'92s
###4365 why nobody\'92s more interested in finding out exactly what happened than I do.\
###4371 The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American
###4378 people in the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened. That this was an
###4382 act of terror and I also said that we\'92re going to hunt down those who committed this
###4388 crime.\ And then a few days later, I was there greeting
###4393 the caskets coming into Andrews Air Force Base and grieving with the families.\
###4399 And the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the Secretary of State, our U.N. Ambassador,
###4410 anybody on my team would play politics or mislead when we\'92ve lost four of our own,
###4416 governor, is offensive. That\'92s not what we do. That\'92s not what I do as president,
###4424 that\'92s not what I do as Commander in Chief.\ CROWLEY: Governor, if you want to...\
###4430 ROMNEY: Yes, I -- I...\ CROWLEY: ... quickly to this please.\
###4432 ROMNEY: I -- I think interesting the president just said something which -- which is that
###4435 on the day after the attack he went into the Rose Garden and said that this was an act
###4439 of terror.\ OBAMA: That\'92s what I said.\
###4442 ROMNEY: You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack, it was an act of terror.\
###4448 It was not a spontaneous demonstration, is that what you\'92re saying?\
###4450 OBAMA: Please proceed governor.\ ROMNEY: I want to make sure we get that for
###4455 the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi
###4459 an act of terror.\ OBAMA: Get the transcript.\
###4461 CROWLEY: It -- it -- it -- he did in fact, sir. So let me -- let me call it an act of
###4465 terror...\ OBAMA: Can you say that a little louder, Candy?\
###4467 CROWLEY: He -- he did call it an act of terror. It did as well take -- it did as well take
###4475 two weeks or so for the whole idea there being a riot out there about this tape to come out.
###4480 You are correct about that.\ ROMNEY: This -- the administration -- the
###4482 administration indicated this was a reaction to a video and was a spontaneous reaction.\
###4490 CROWLEY: It did.\ ROMNEY: It took them a long time to say this
###4492 was a terrorist act by a terrorist group. And to suggest -- am I incorrect in that regard,
###4498 on Sunday, the -- your secretary --\ OBAMA: Candy?\
###4502 ROMNEY: Excuse me. The ambassador of the United Nations went on the Sunday television shows
###4506 and spoke about how --\ OBAMA: Candy, I\'92m --\
###4507 ROMNEY: -- this was a spontaneous --\ CROWLEY: Mr. President, let me --\
###4509 OBAMA: I\'92m happy to have a longer conversation --\
###4510 CROWLEY: I know you --\ OBAMA: -- about foreign policy.\
###4511 CROWLEY: Absolutely. But I want to -- I want to move you on and also --\
###4513 OBAMA: OK. I\'92m happy to do that, too.\ CROWLEY: -- the transcripts and --\
###4515 OBAMA: I just want to make sure that --\ CROWLEY: -- figure out what we --\
###4517 OBAMA: -- all of these wonderful folks are going to have a chance to get some of their
###4521 questions answered.\ CROWLEY: Because what I -- what I want to
###4522 do, Mr. President, stand there a second, because I want to introduce you to Nina Gonzalez,
###4526 who brought up a question that we hear a lot, both over the Internet and from this crowd.\
###4532 QUESTION: President Obama, during the Democratic National Convention in 2008, you stated you
###4541 wanted to keep AK-47s out of the hands of criminals. What has your administration done
###4548 or planned to do to limit the availability of assault weapons?\
###4552 OBAMA: We\'92re a nation that believes in the Second Amendment, and I believe in the
###4557 Second Amendment. We\'92ve got a long tradition of hunting and sportsmen and people who want
###4565 to make sure they can protect themselves.\ But there have been too many instances during
###4571 the course of my presidency, where I\'92ve had to comfort families who have lost somebody.
###4576 Most recently out in Aurora. You know, just a couple of weeks ago, actually, probably
###4583 about a month, I saw a mother, who I had met at the bedside of her son, who had been shot
###4591 in that theater.\ And her son had been shot through the head.
###4597 And we spent some time, and we said a prayer and, remarkably, about two months later, this
###4605 young man and his mom showed up, and he looked unbelievable, good as new.\
###4614 But there were a lot of families who didn\'92t have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters
###4620 or husbands didn\'92t survive.\ So my belief is that, (A), we have to enforce
###4626 the laws we\'92ve already got, make sure that we\'92re keeping guns out of the hands of
###4630 criminals, those who are mentally ill. We\'92ve done a much better job in terms of background
###4636 checks, but we\'92ve got more to do when it comes to enforcement.\
###4640 But I also share your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters
###4646 don\'92t belong on our streets. And so what I\'92m trying to do is to get a broader conversation
###4653 about how do we reduce the violence generally. Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault
###4661 weapons ban reintroduced. But part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence.
###4667 Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago, there\'92s an awful lot of violence and they\'92re
###4670 not using AK-47s. They\'92re using cheap hand guns.\
###4673 And so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity; that
###4679 our schools are working; that if there\'92s violence on the streets, that working with
###4684 faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of control.\
###4689 And so what I want is a -- is a comprehensive strategy. Part of it is seeing if we can get
###4695 automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals and
###4702 the mentally ill. But part of it is also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these
###4707 communities and making sure we catch violent impulses before they occur.\
###4711 CROWLEY: Governor Romney, the question is about assault weapons, AK-47s.\
###4714 ROMNEY: Yeah, I\'92m not in favor of new pieces of legislation on -- on guns and taking guns
###4721 away or making certain guns illegal. We, of course, don\'92t want to have automatic weapons,
###4725 and that\'92s already illegal in this country to have automatic weapons. What I believe
###4729 is we have to do, as the president mentioned towards the end of his remarks there, which
###4733 is to make enormous efforts to enforce the gun laws that we have, and to change the culture
###4739 of violence that we have.\ And you ask how -- how are we going to do
###4742 that? And there are a number of things. He mentioned good schools. I totally agree. We
###4746 were able to drive our schools to be number one in the nation in my state. And I believe
###4750 if we do a better job in education, we\'92ll -- we\'92ll give people the -- the hope and
###4754 opportunity they deserve and perhaps less violence from that. But let me mention another
###4757 thing. And that is parents. We need moms and dads, helping to raise kids. Wherever possible
###4763 the -- the benefit of having two parents in the home, and that\'92s not always possible.
###4767 A lot of great single moms, single dads. But gosh to tell our kids that before they have
###4772 babies, they ought to think about getting married to someone, that\'92s a great idea.\
###4776 Because if there\'92s a two parent family, the prospect of living in poverty goes down
###4780 dramatically. The opportunities that the child will -- will be able to achieve increase dramatically.
###4786 So we can make changes in the way our culture works to help bring people away from violence
###4791 and give them opportunity, and bring them in the American system. The -- the greatest
###4796 failure we\'92ve had with regards to -- to gun violence in some respects is what -- what
###4800 is known as Fast and Furious. Which was a program under this administration, and how
###4806 it worked exactly I think we don\'92t know precisely, where thousands of automatic, and
###4811 AK-47 type weapons were -- were given to people that ultimately gave them to -- to drug lords.\
###4818 They used those weapons against -- against their own citizens and killed Americans with
###4823 them. And this was a -- this was a program of the government. For what purpose it was
###4826 put in place, I can\'92t imagine. But it\'92s one of the great tragedies related to violence
###4832 in our society which has occurred during this administration. Which I think the American
###4836 people would like to understand fully, it\'92s been investigated to a degree, but -- but
###4841 the administration has carried out executive privilege to prevent all of the information
###4846 from coming out.\ I\'92d like to understand who it was that
###4849 did this, what the idea was behind it, why it led to the violence, thousands of guns
###4854 going to Mexican drug lords. OBAMA: Candy?\ CROWLEY: Governor, Governor, if I could, the
###4858 question was about these assault weapons that once were once banned and are no longer banned.\
###4865 I know that you signed an assault weapons ban when you were in Massachusetts, obviously,
###4869 with this question, you no longer do support that. Why is that, given the kind of violence
###4874 that we see sometimes with these mass killings? Why is it that you have changed your mind?\
###4880 ROMNEY: Well, Candy, actually, in my state, the pro-gun folks and the anti-gun folks came
###4885 together and put together a piece of legislation. And it\'92s referred to as an assault weapon
###4891 ban, but it had, at the signing of the bill, both the pro-gun and the anti-gun people came
###4895 together, because it provided opportunities for both that both wanted.\
###4899 There were hunting opportunities, for instance, that haven\'92t previously been available
###4902 and so forth, so it was a mutually agreed- upon piece of legislation. That\'92s what
###4907 we need more of, Candy. What we have right now in Washington is a place that\'92s gridlocked.\
###4911 CROWLEY: So I could -- if you could get people to agree to it, you would be for it?\
###4915 ROMNEY: We have --\ OBAMA: Candy?\
###4916 ROMNEY: -- we haven\'92t had the leadership in Washington to work on a bipartisan basis.
###4919 I was able to do that in my state and bring these two together.\
###4922 CROWLEY: Quickly, Mr. President.\ OBAMA: The -- first of all, I think Governor
###4928 Romney was for an assault weapons ban before he was against it. And he said that the reason
###4935 he changed his mind was, in part, because he was seeking the endorsement of the National
###4939 Rifle Association. So that\'92s on the record.\ But I think that one area we agree on is the
###4946 important of parents and the importance of schools, because I do believe that if our
###4951 young people have opportunity, then they are less likely to engage in these kinds of violent
###4957 acts. We\'92re not going to eliminate everybody who is mentally disturbed and we have got
###4962 to make sure they don\'92t get weapons.\ (AUDIO GAP)\
###4963 OBAMA: because I do believe that if our young people have opportunity, then they\'92re less
###4963 likely to engage in these kind of violent acts.\
###4964 We\'92re not going to eliminate everybody who is mentally disturbed, and we\'92ve got
###4964 to make sure they don\'92t get weapons. But we can make a difference in terms ensuring
###4967 that every young person in America, regardless of where they come from, what they look like,
###4972 have a chance to succeed.\ And, Candy, we haven\'92t had a chance to
###4974 talk about education much, but I think it is very important to understand that the reforms
###4981 we\'92ve put in place, working with 46 governors around the country, are seeing schools that
###4987 are some of the ones that are the toughest for kids starting to succeed. We\'92re starting
###4992 to see gains in math and science.\ When it comes to community colleges, we are
###4997 setting up programs, including with Nassau Community College, to retrain workers, including
###5004 young people who may have dropped out of school but now are getting another chance, training
###5008 them for the jobs that exist right now.\ And in fact, employers are looking for skilled
###5014 workers. And so we\'92re matching them up. Giving them access to higher education. As
###5019 I said, we have made sure that millions of young people are able to get an education
###5024 that they weren\'92t able to get before.\ Now...\
###5026 CROWLEY: Mr. President, I have to -- I have to move you along here. You said you wanted
###5029 to...\ (CROSSTALK)\
###5030 CROWLEY: We need to do it here.\ OBAMA: But -- but it\'92ll -- it\'92ll -- it\'92ll
###5031 be...\ (CROSSTALK)\
###5031 OBAMA: ... just one second.\ CROWLEY: One...\
###5032 OBAMA: Because -- because this is important. This is part of the choice in this election.\
###5037 When Governor Romney was asked whether teachers, hiring more teachers was important to growing
###5043 our economy, Governor Romney said that doesn\'92t grow our economy.\
###5047 When -- when he was asked would class size...\ (CROSSTALK)\
###5049 CROWLEY: The question, Mr. President, was guns here, so I need to move us along.\
###5053 OBAMA: I understand.\ CROWLEY: You know, the question was guns.
###5054 So let me -- let me bring in another...\ OBAMA: But this will make a difference in
###5056 terms of whether or not we can move this economy forward for these young people...\
###5059 CROWLEY: I understand.\ OBAMA: ... and reduce our violence.\
###5061 CROWLEY: OK. Thank you so much.\ I want to ask Carol Goldberg to stand up,
###5065 because she gets to a question that both these men have been passionate about. It\'92s for
###5068 Governor Romney.\ QUESTION: The outsourcing of American jobs
###5072 overseas has taken a toll on our economy. What plans do you have to put back and keep
###5078 jobs here in the United States?\ ROMNEY: Boy, great question and important
###5082 question, because you\'92re absolutely right. The place where we\'92ve seen manufacturing
###5086 go has been China. China is now the largest manufacturer in the world. It used to be the
###5091 United States of America. A lot of good people have lost jobs. A half a million manufacturing
###5096 jobs have been lost in the last four years. That\'92s total over the last four years.\
###5100 One of the reasons for that is that people think it\'92s more attractive in some cases
###5104 to go offshore than to stay here. We have made it less attractive for enterprises to
###5109 stay here than to go offshore from time to time. What I will do as president is make
###5114 sure it\'92s more attractive to come to America again.\
###5117 This is the way we\'92re going to create jobs in this country. It\'92s not by trickle-down
###5121 government, saying we\'92re going to take more money from people and hire more government
###5125 workers, raise more taxes, put in place more regulations. Trickle-down government has never
###5130 worked here, has never worked anywhere.\ I want to make America the most attractive
###5135 place in the world for entrepreneurs, for small business, for big business, to invest
###5141 and grow in America.\ Now, we\'92re going to have to make sure that
###5145 as we trade with other nations that they play by the rules. And China hasn\'92t. One of
###5150 the reasons -- or one of the ways they don\'92t play by the rules is artificially holding
###5153 down the value of their currency. Because if they put their currency down low, that
###5157 means their prices on their goods are low. And that makes them advantageous in the marketplace.\
###5163 We lose sales. And manufacturers here in the U.S. making the same products can\'92t compete.
###5168 China has been a currency manipulator for years and years and years. And the president
###5173 has a regular opportunity to label them as a currency manipulator, but refuses to do
###5179 so.\ On day one, I will label China a currency
###5183 manipulator, which will allow me as president to be able to put in place, if necessary,
###5189 tariffs where I believe that they are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers.\
###5194 So we\'92re going to make sure that people we trade with around the world play by the
###5198 rules. But let me -- let me not just stop there. Don\'92t forget, what\'92s key to bringing
###5204 back jobs here is not just finding someone else to punish, and I\'92m going to be strict
###5209 with people who we trade with to make sure they -- they follow the law and play by the
###5212 rules, but it\'92s also to make America the most attractive place in the world for businesses
###5217 of all kinds.\ That\'92s why I want to down the tax rates
###5221 on small employers, big employers, so they want to be here. Canada\'92s tax rate on companies
###5226 is now 15 percent. Ours is 35 percent. So if you\'92re starting a business, where would
###5232 you rather start it? We have to be competitive if we\'92re going to create more jobs here.\
###5238 Regulations have quadrupled. The rate of regulations quadrupled under this president. I talk to
###5244 small businesses across the country. They say, \'93We feel like we\'92re under attack
###5247 from our own government.\'94 I want to make sure that regulators see their job as encouraging
###5252 small business, not crushing it. And there\'92s no question but that Obamacare has been an
###5257 extraordinary deterrent to enterprises of all kinds hiring people.\
###5262 My priority is making sure that we get more people hired. If we have more people hired,
###5268 if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get back all kinds of jobs into this country,
###5273 then you\'92re going to see rising incomes again. The reason incomes are down is because
###5277 unemployment is so high. I know what it takes to get this to happen, and my plan will do
###5282 that, and one part of it is to make sure that we keep China playing by the rules.\
###5287 CROWLEY: Mr. President, two minutes here, because we are then going to go to our last
###5292 question.\ OBAMA: OK. We need to create jobs here. And
###5297 both Governor Romney and I agree actually that we should lower our corporate tax rate.
###5300 It\'92s too high. But there\'92s a difference in terms of how we would do it. I want to
###5305 close loopholes that allow companies to deduct expenses when they move to China; that allow
###5312 them to profit offshore and not have to get taxed, so they have tax advantages offshore.\
###5322 All those changes in our tax code would make a difference.\
###5324 Now, Governor Romney actually wants to expand those tax breaks. One of his big ideas when
###5330 it comes to corporate tax reform would be to say, if you invest overseas, you make profits
###5336 overseas, you don\'92t have to pay U.S. taxes.\ But, of course, if you\'92re a small business
###5342 or a mom-and-pop business or a big business starting up here, you\'92ve got to pay even
###5346 the reduced rate that Governor Romney\'92s talking about.\
###5349 And it\'92s estimated that that will create 800,000 new jobs. The problem is they\'92ll
###5354 be in china. Or India. Or Germany.\ That\'92s not the way we\'92re going to create
###5361 jobs here. The way we\'92re going to create jobs here is not just to change our tax code,
###5364 but also to double our exports. And we are on pace to double our exports, one of the
###5369 commitments I made when I was president. That\'92s creating tens of thousands of jobs all across
###5374 the country. That\'92s why we\'92ve kept on pushing trade deals, but trade deals that
###5380 make sure that American workers and American businesses are getting a good deal.\
###5383 Now, Governor Romney talked about China, as I already indicated. In the private sector,
###5391 Governor Romney\'92s company invested in what were called pioneers of outsourcing. That\'92s
###5395 not my phrase. That\'92s what reporters called it.\
###5400 And as far as currency manipulation, the currency has actually gone up 11 percent since I\'92ve
###5405 been president because we have pushed them hard. And we\'92ve put unprecedented trade
###5411 pressure on China. That\'92s why exports have significantly increased under my presidency.
###5417 That\'92s going to help to create jobs here.\ CROWLEY: Mr. President, we have a really short
###5420 time for a quick discussion here.\ iPad, the Macs, the iPhones, they are all
###5428 manufactured in China. One of the major reasons is labor is so much cheaper here. How do you
###5433 convince a great American company to bring that manufacturing back here?\
###5439 ROMNEY: The answer is very straightforward. We can compete with anyone in the world as
###5444 long as the playing field is level. China\'92s been cheating over the years. One by holding
###5449 down the value of their currency. Number two, by stealing our intellectual property; our
###5453 designs, our patents, our technology. There\'92s even an Apple store in China that\'92s a counterfeit
###5458 Apple store, selling counterfeit goods. They hack into our computers. We will have to have
###5463 people play on a fair basis, that\'92s number one.\
###5466 Number two, we have to make America the most attractive place for entrepreneurs, for people
###5471 who want to expand their business. That\'92s what brings jobs in. The president\'92s characterization
###5476 of my tax plan...\ (CROSSTALK)\
###5477 ROMNEY: ...is completely...is completely...\ (CROSSTALK)\
###5478 ROMNEY: ...is completely false. Let me tell you...\
###5480 CROWLEY: Let me to go the president here because we really are running out of time. And the
###5484 question is can we ever get -- we can\'92t get wages like that. It can\'92t be sustained.\
###5487 OBAMA: Candy, there are some jobs that are not going to come back. Because they are low
###5492 wage, low skill jobs. I want high wage, high skill jobs. That\'92s why we have to emphasize
###5499 manufacturing. That\'92s why we have to invest in advanced manufacturing. That\'92s why we\'92ve
###5503 got to make sure that we\'92ve got the best science and research in the world. And when
###5506 we talk about deficits, if we\'92re adding to our deficit for tax cuts for folks who
###5513 don\'92t need them, and we\'92re cutting investments in research and science that will create the
###5517 next Apple, create the next new innovation that will sell products around the world,
###5523 we will lose that race.\ If we\'92re not training engineers to make
###5526 sure that they are equipped here in this country. Then companies won\'92t come here. Those investments
###5533 are what\'92s going to help to make sure that we continue to lead this world economy, not
###5538 just next year, but 10 years from now, 50 years from now, 100 years from now.\
###5542 CROWLEY: Thanks Mr. President.\ (CROSSTALK)\
###5542 CROWLEY: Governor Romney?\ ROMNEY: Government does not create jobs. Government
###5545 does not create jobs.\ CROWLEY: Governor Romney, I want to introduce
###5547 you to Barry Green, because he\'92s going to have the last question to you first?\
###5551 ROMNEY: Barry? Where is Barry?\ QUESTION: Hi, Governor. I think this is a
###5556 tough question. To each of you. What do you believe is the biggest misperception that
###5564 the American people have about you as a man and a candidate? Using specific examples,
###5571 can you take this opportunity to debunk that misperception and set us straight?\
###5577 ROMNEY: Thank you, and that\'92s an opportunity for me, and I appreciate it.\
###5582 In the nature of a campaign, it seems that some campaigns are focused on attacking a
###5587 person rather than prescribing their own future and the things they\'92d like to do. In the
###5592 course of that, I think the president\'92s campaign has tried to characterize me as -- as
###5596 someone who\'92s very different than who I am.\
###5598 I care about 100 percent of the American people. I want 100 percent of the American people
###5603 to have a bright and prosperous future. I care about our kids. I understand what it
###5608 takes to make a bright and prosperous future for America again. I spent my life in the
###5613 private sector, not in government. I\'92m a guy who wants to help with the experience
###5618 I have, the American people.\ My -- my passion probably flows from the fact
###5623 that I believe in God. And I believe we\'92re all children of the same God. I believe we
###5628 have a responsibility to care for one another. I -- I served as a missionary for my church.
###5632 I served as a pastor in my congregation for about 10 years. I\'92ve sat across the table
###5638 from people who were out of work and worked with them to try and find new work or to help
###5642 them through tough times.\ I went to the Olympics when they were in trouble
###5646 to try and get them on track. And as governor of my state, I was able to get 100 percent
###5651 of my people insured, all my kids, about 98 percent of the adults. I was able also to
###5658 get our schools ranked number one in the nation, so 100 percent of our kids would have a bright
###5661 opportunity for a future.\ ROMNEY: I understand that I can get this country
###5666 on track again. We don\'92t have to settle for what we\'92re going through. We don\'92t
###5669 have to settle for gasoline at four bucks. We don\'92t have to settle for unemployment
###5674 at a chronically high level. We don\'92t have to settle for 47 million people on food stamps.
###5679 We don\'92t have to settle for 50 percent of kids coming out of college not able to
###5683 get work. We don\'92t have to settle for 23 million people struggling to find a good job.\
###5689 If I become president, I\'92ll get America working again. I will get us on track to a
###5693 balanced budget. The president hasn\'92t. I will. I\'92ll make sure we can reform Medicare
###5699 and Social Security to preserve them for coming -- coming generations. The president said
###5703 he would. He didn\'92t.\ CROWLEY: Governor...\
###5705 ROMNEY: I\'92ll get our incomes up. And by the way, I\'92ve done these things. I served
###5709 as governor and showed I could get them done.\ CROWLEY: Mr. President, last two minutes belong
###5713 to you.\ OBAMA: Barry, I think a lot of this campaign,
###5719 maybe over the last four years, has been devoted to this nation that I think government creates
###5724 jobs, that that somehow is the answer.\ That\'92s not what I believe. I believe that
###5729 the free enterprise system is the greatest engine of prosperity the world\'92s ever known.\
###5734 I believe in self-reliance and individual initiative and risk takers being rewarded.
###5743 But I also believe that everybody should have a fair shot and everybody should do their
###5747 fair share and everybody should play by the same rules, because that\'92s how our economy\'92s
###5753 grown. That\'92s how we built the world\'92s greatest middle class.\
###5758 And -- and that is part of what\'92s at stake in this election. There\'92s a fundamentally
###5763 different vision about how we move our country forward.\
###5767 I believe Governor Romney is a good man. Loves his family, cares about his faith. But I also
###5775 believe that when he said behind closed doors that 47 percent of the country considered
###5781 themselves victims who refuse personal responsibility, think about who he was talking about.\
###5790 Folks on Social Security who\'92ve worked all their lives. Veterans who\'92ve sacrificed
###5796 for this country. Students who are out there trying to hopefully advance their own dreams,
###5803 but also this country\'92s dreams. Soldiers who are overseas fighting for us right now.
###5809 People who are working hard every day, paying payroll tax, gas taxes, but don\'92t make
###5814 enough income.\ And I want to fight for them. That\'92s what
###5818 I\'92ve been doing for the last four years. Because if they succeed, I believe the country
###5823 succeeds.\ When my grandfather fought in World War II
###5826 and he came back and he got a G.I. Bill and that allowed him to go to college, that wasn\'92t
###5832 a handout. That was something that advanced the entire country. And I want to make sure
###5837 that the next generation has those same opportunities. That\'92s why I\'92m asking for your vote
###5841 and that\'92s why I\'92m asking for another four years.\
###5843 CROWLEY: President Obama, Governor Romney, thank you for being here tonight.\
###5847 On that note we have come to an end of this town hall debate. Our thanks to the participants
###5849 for their time and to the people of Hofstra University for their hospitality.\
###5860 The next and final debate takes place Monday night at Lynn (ph) University in Boca Raton,
###5862 Florida. Don\'92t forget to watch. Election Day is three weeks from today. Don\'92t forget
###5866 to vote.\ Good night.\
###5867 (APPLAUSE)}
