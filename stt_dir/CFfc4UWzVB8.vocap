###10 FEMALE SPEAKER: On the 1st of May, the small Swedish town of
###12 Eskilstuna, one hour west of Stockholm, went
###15 from this to this.
###21 [HEAVY METAL MUSIC]
###33 The extreme right groups Svenskarnas Parti and
###35 Forbundet Nationell Ungdom had chosen the sacred
###38 international labor movement day and the city of Eskilstuna
###42 to spread their xenophobic agenda, Swedish jobs for
###45 Swedish workers.
###47 This is did not go down well with the left-wing kids, who
###50 won't stand for extreme right marches on their streets,
###52 especially not on May Day, which is a
###54 huge deal in Sweden.
###57 They founded the organization First of May for All and began
###60 planning a massive counter demonstration.
###64 We met up with them as they started
###66 gathering in the city center.

###93 FEMALE SPEAKER: While more and more people joined Kim and his
###95 friends in the counter-demonstration, the
###97 nationalists started gathering at their
###99 assigned meeting points.
###101 Despite supporters coming from Norway and Germany, the
###104 turnout wasn't exactly massive.
###106 [SPEAKING SWEDISH]
###107 
###118 FEMALE SPEAKER: The counter demonstration soon gained some
###120 unexpected momentum.
###122 They managed to form a blockade, preventing half of
###124 the nationalists from joining their peers.
###127 The blocked nationalists eventually managed to break
###130 away, marching straight into a park where families were
###133 having picnics.
###134 Some kids from the counter-demonstration
###136 followed, throwing bottles and rocks at them.
###139 The nationalists got pissed off and trashed some poor
###142 guy's car in the process.
###143 
###148 When the nationalists finally began their march, hundreds of
###151 people, everyone from thugs, dogs, grannies, to the Black
###156 Bloc stormed the streets to form a blockade.
###158 [CHANTING IN SWEDISH]
###160 
###172 FEMALE SPEAKER: Then some troublemakers started throwing
###174 rocks at the nationalists, and it all erupted into violent
###176 riots, sending at least eight people to hospital with
###179 cracked skulls.
###180 
###183 After about an hour-long stand off, the nationalists started
###186 marching, protected by the police.
###188 But they were forced to take an alternative route.
###192 The kids from the counter-demonstration started
###194 running, taking a shortcut to form another blockade further
###197 up the street.
###198 But they were chased away by the riot police and their
###200 angry dogs.
###202 This process kept repeating itself all afternoon.
###205 
###208 Like ferrets on speed, the counter-demonstration had
###210 become a living organism that just wouldn't budge until the
###213 nationalists had gone home.

###265 FEMALE SPEAKER: The police lost control over the city and
###267 had to call in reinforcements from Stockholm and other
###270 nearby areas.
###272 Realizing they wouldn't reach their destination, the extreme
###275 right groups decided to hold their speeches from the back
###277 of a rental truck, but only the nationalists gathered.
###280 The police a few booing counter
###282 demonstrators could hear them.
###286 At 6:00 PM, their demonstration permit ended,
###289 and the police escorted the nationalists
###291 back to their cars.
###294 By then, extra police forces from Stockholm and the
###297 surrounding areas had arrived and began mass searching the
###300 counter-demonstrators and forcing them into buses.
###304 Some of them broke away to bid the nationalists
###306 a final, fond farewell.
