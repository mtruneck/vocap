###3 Oooh !
###8 Eeee !
###16 Hello ?
###18 Hi. Hi !
###20 - Yeah. No, I just... I'm just... - Uhhh !
###23 ..you know, just hanging out... Stop it !
###27 Er, no. Nobody, nobody.
###29 Erm, yeah.
###31 Today ? All right, yeah. OK.
###33 Well, I'll, er... I'll see you later, then. Bye.
###40 That was Sarah. She wants to see me today.
###43 - I wonder what that's all about. - I dunno.
###45 Maybe she wants her CD player back.
###48 - Oooh ! - Maybe she's getting married.
###50 Ooh !
###53 - Maybe she's pregnant. - Aaaarghhhh !...
###65 - So what's the attraction of this, then ? - What ?
###68 - Skateboarding. - What do you mean ?
###70 - Why do you do it ? - It's quicker than walking.
###72 - Is it easy ? - Daisy ! I'm kinda busy at the moment.
###76 - Have you seen my chocolate beanie ? - I was just asking.
###80 The only woman in my life I've ever cared about
###82 who isn't computer-generated or a fictional FBI agent
###84 has just phoned up and asked to see me.
###86 You've picked a weird time to take a spontaneous interest in my travel habits.
###89 - Thanks ! - All right, don't get upset.
###92 You hate skateboarding, anyway. You're always saying it's childish,
###94 which really pisses me off because it's not.
###100 - All right, calm down. - I am calm !
###104 I thought you were gonna take me to the ICA to see Akira.
###108 Yeah, well, you know,... we'll watch it on video.
###110 What was all that stuff you were saying about "You've gotta see it on the big screen" ?
###114 Well, we'll just... sit close to the telly.
###118 All right, well,... take care of yourself.
###122 - Thank you. - That's what you're best at, isn't it ?
###132 (Teo Usuelli: Piacere Sequence)
###149 So, er... how's it going ?
###150 Tim, I've split up with Duane.
###152 <i>What are you telling me for ?</i>
###159 Daddy cool.
###161 Ow ! Hi.
###163 - Hi. - Shall we go in ?
###168 Can you believe it ? He's going out to meet her !
###170 So ? I see all of my ex-boyfriends.
###173 I see my ex-girlfriends.
###175 Well, not so much see as... watch.
###179 - They might get back together. - That's what she wants him to think.
###182 She's gonna look really good, to remind him of how much he likes her,
###186 and say things like "I'm just... I'm really confused."
###190 What kind of creature does that...
###192 and knowingly tortures someone just to satisfy her own vanity ?
###200 - What are you doing today, Brian ? - Going to an exhibition later.
###203 Tunde Aragundade's White Paintings of the 20th Century.
###206 - Sounds riveting. - Is he the one who does the white paintings ?
###210 Yeah.
###212 And he wears cheesecloth shirts ? I know who you mean.
###216 D'you wanna come ?
###218 The thing is, I can't really walk in these heels. They're more for sitting down than moving.
###223 Oh, OK.
###225 I'll pop back later if you change your...
###228 shoes.
###231 Bye.
###234 - Did Brian just ask you out ? - No.
###238 - Yes, he did. - No, he didn't.
###240 - Yes, he did. - Don't be silly.
###242 Yes, he diiiiid !
###244 Did he ?
###256 So, er... how's it going ?
###260 Tim, I've split up with Duane.
###262 (Fantastic Plastic Machine: S'il Vous Pla–æt)
###275 Hey !
###293 - How did it go ? - Pretty good.
###295 - Pretty good ? - Yeah, she's split up with Duane.
###299 - Right. - She said she felt a little bit confused,
###302 but basically... I think she wants me back.
###305 We're gonna meet at the Bell later on, talk at length.
###308 - Right. - Yes, and I've got a funny feeling
###312 she's gonna want me to move back in with her.
###317 - What was that ? - It was our new doorbell.
###320 I bought it back from the shop. It was gonna be a surprise.
###323 <i>- It was a surprise. - Good.</i>
###325 What do you mean, you've got a funny feeling ?
###327 I just know, you know. I can read her like a book.
###331 - Don't judge a book by its cover. - He who dares wins.
###333 - Look before you leap. - Do you believe in life after love ?
###336 - That's a song. - Shit.
###337 How do you know she's not gonna change her mind and dump you again ?
###343 - That's the doorbell again. - Go on, then.
###347 All right !
###357 It's Mike. Gotta take him for his re-evaluation.
###359 - Hello, Daisy. - Tim, I think we should talk about this.
###363 Did I ever tell you how Mike and myself became such good friends ?
###366 It's quite an interesting story. It happened when we were children,
###370 a long, long time ago.
###375 <i>Tim ?</i>
###377 <i>Tim ? Tim !</i>
###379 What ? !
###381 - What ? - I can't believe you wanna move out.
###384 I don't want to...
###386 I don't want to move out from you, I just want to move in with her.
###390 - I don't understand. - What is your problem ?
###392 - I thought you'd be happy for me. - Oh, I am. Yes, I am.
###395 It's what I want, Daisy. You must have things you want.
###398 You always go on about wanting to go to Asia and see the Taj Mahal. I don't complain.
###402 Yeah, I wanna go to Asia, I wanna see the Taj Mahal.
###405 But the Taj Mahal didn't sleep with its boss behind my back and break my heart !
###411 Yeah, well, it might if you go to Asia.
###416 What's her problem ?
###418 Maybe she's worried about you stumbling blindly into a doomed relationship,
###422 getting badly hurt again,
###423 while losing this place and the friendship you've built up over the past six months.
###428 It must mean a lot to her or she wouldn't be so bothered about your emotional wellbeing.
###434 Get in the car, you big ape.
###436 OK, then.
###440 Just be yourself, OK ? Don't do anything odd. It's really important for me that you get this.
###445 - It isn't your fault, Tim. - It is, Mike.
###447 - Isn't. - Is.
###448 - Isn't. - Is.
###448 - Isn't. - Is.
###449 - Is. - Isn't...
###450 - Ooh, why, you... - Ahh !
###453 It is my fault, Mike. I know we were only little, but...
###457 I can still see you up that tree.
###471 Come on !
###473 Come on !
###484 If you hadn't jumped, your retinas'd still be attached - you'd be in the regular army.
###487 - You don't know that, Tim. - Just...
###490 - Give it your best shot, OK ? - Can't you come in with me ?
###493 I'm not your dad, Mike.
###497 Here's your sandwiches. I'll pick you up at five.
###501 <i>I'm Andy McNab, I'm Andy McNab, I'm Andy McNab,</i>
###504 <i>I'm Andy McNab, I'm Andie MacDowell,,,</i>
###513 Mr Watt, we're here to ascertain whether you're ready to rejoin the Territorial Army.
###518 Yes.
###519 It's important to establish that you understand the reasons for your original suspension.
###525 - I do, sir. - Go on.
###527 In 1994, while on weekend manoeuvres in France,
###530 I commandeered a Chieftain tank without the permission of my immediate superiors.
###534 I then attempted to invade Paris.
###537 However, en route I stopped at Disneyland, or Eurodisney as it was then called,
###541 and was subsequently apprehended on Space Mountain.
###544 Do you have any explanation as to why you might have done this ?
###547 At the time, I was suffering serious emotional problems that clearly affected my judgment.
###553 I had immersed myself in a fantasy world of my own creation
###556 and as a result I became very insular and uncommunicative.
###559 Why do you think that was ?
###562 I dunno.
###568 Thanks for the shoes, Daise.
###571 Ahh, are you sure you don't want to come, mm ?
###576 No, better not, I've got loads of work to do.
###579 Well, maybe I could...
###597 Kick. Kick. Kick !
###599 Kick ! Kick !
###611 - I'm going to pick up Mike from the TA. - Yeah, all right.
###613 What time are you meeting Sarah ?
###615 Will you get off my back ? !
###618 - I'm not on your back. - You are !
###620 Yeah... I can feel you, you're there, like Jabba's little mate - "Wa-ha-ha !"
###624 Why can't you just wish me luck and say "Have a good time" ?
###627 I'm not a hypocrite, I wouldn't wish you luck with something I think is bad for you.
###630 - Well, can't you pretend ? - No.
###632 - You just don't want me to move out, do you ? - What ?
###634 - You don't want me to move out. - Is that what you think this is about ?
###637 - Well... - You conceited little shit !
###639 Don't you dare flatter yourself to think that I would stand in your way for my own ends.
###644 For your information, I would be sad if you moved out,
###647 but it isn't about me.
###649 I'm your friend, and friends are supposed to look out for each other,
###652 and I think you're making a mistake.
###654 If you're too stupid to see that, then someone, a friend, me, should point it out to you.
###661 <i>Well, OK, while we're being friends, maybe I should be a friend to you</i>
###665 and point out that you're using my personal problems
###667 as another in a long line of excuses not to get out your bloody typewriter and do some work !
###672 <i>I am not avoiding work.</i>
###675 Oh, right, OK... "Ooh, let's have a party."
###678 "Ooh, let's do some theatre."
###680 "Ooh, let's get a dog."
###681 "Ooh, let's spend hours in front of our bedroom mirror bogling to Aswad !"
###685 - That was research ! - You keep telling yourself that, Daisy,
###688 but I think I am big enough and ugly enough to make my own mistakes !
###692 Well, Sarah obviously does.
###698 <i>Nina Williams wins !</i>
###700 <i>Ha-ha-ha !</i>
###703 <i>Daisy Steiner wins !</i>
###705 <i>Ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha-ha ha-ha !</i>
###725 - Oh, hi, Marsha. - Hello. Are you busy ?
###728 Erm, well, yes, I'm...
###731 working.
###733 But I could do with a breather.
###738 Listen,... I couldn't help overhearing you and Tim rowing.
###742 - Really ? - Oh, it's all right.
###745 It was ever so loud.
###747 - ..bogling to Aswad ! - That was research !
###750 Sorry.
###751 That's all right. Do you want a splash of vino collapso ?
###757 Once again, the fruit of my loins has fucked off to Top Shop with the housekeeping.
###761 Well, I'll just have the one.
###764 I just saw that friend of yours, Twit, leaving with Brian.
###769 - What's that all about, then ? - They're just going to an exhibition together.
###773 Is it serious ?
###774 Tunde Aragundade.
###776 Bloody hell.
###779 Oh, well. C'est la vie.
###782 Et tu, Brian ?
###786 What is going on between you and Brian ?
###790 - This one ? - War.
###792 - This one ? - Bombs ?
###795 - This one ? - Guts.
###799 Guns.
###802 Guts and guns.
###806 Butterfly.
###809 Butterfly with a bomb.
###812 Finally, Mr Watt, how does this make you feel ?
###817 Nice.
###819 Welcome back, Mike.
###836 You and Brian ?
###839 Yeah.
###842 Well...
###844 one night he came up here, begging me to let him stay cos he couldn't pay his rent.
###851 We had a couple of bottles of duty-free grappa.
###855 Next thing I know,...
###858 I'm riding him like a bitch from hell.
###860 You became lovers ?
###863 No, it was his rent, really.
###869 Did he leave a deposit ?
###875 To tell you the truth,
###877 I'm not sure how interested he is in women.
###882 Nice Arse.
###885 1957.
###891 The Fifth Elephant.
###893 Mm.
###895 I mean, look at them, they're all so...
###898 They're really...
###900 Samey.
###901 Yeah.
###903 Exactly.
###911 So, what have you and Tim been rowing about ?
###914 - He says he wants to move out. - Oh, dear.
###918 Trouble in paradise.
###920 He says I was avoiding work.
###923 - Well, are you ? - No !
###926 Yes.
###928 Aah, don't worry, he'll come back.
###930 - If he doesn't, are you gonna chuck me out ? - No !
###935 I like having you here.
###937 <i>I feel like you've always lived here.</i>
###941 I hope you never leave.
###943 <i>Never leave,,, Never leave,,, Never leave,,, Never leave,,,</i>
###949 (Aswad: Don't Turn Around)
###957 Sorry, Marsha, I think... I've got to get on with some work.
###961 Oh, it's all right, kitten.
###963 I'm gonna go and have a lie down, I'm pissed.
###967 Listen,...
###968 you can tell your friend Twit she can have Brian.
###972 His housing benefit's come through, anyway.
###977 - Good night. - Night.
###981 Right. You're coming with me.
###991 (Theme from Murder, She Wrote)
###1021 This was really inspiring, thank you, Brian.
###1024 - I got you a postcard. - Thanks.
###1026 Oh, my favourite !
###1029 Well,... I suppose... I'll see you.
###1032 Exhibition on next week. Sounds good.
###1036 - Really ? - It's Roman Duchamp's insect faecal matter.
###1039 Faecal ? Lovely.
###1042 I was thinking...
###1044 afterwards, if you, er...
###1047 er, want to go for a drink ?
###1049 Yep, OK.
###1077 <i>I've held you in my arms a thousand times</i>
###1080 <i>Closed my eyes and known we would always be together</i>
###1083 <i>I smiled at you through all your many lies</i>
###1085 <i>Unknowing and unthinking that eternity would be never</i>
###1088 <i>As distance dulls the memory and bitter history grows hazy</i>
###1092 <i>I realise my one true love is in fact a girl called,,,</i>
###1096 - Hi. - Hi ! Hi, hi.
###1102 - Your hair looks nice. - Thanks.
###1105 I see you're still murdering yours with peroxide.
###1107 Ah ! Don't know what you mean.
###1115 I guess we've got a lot to talk about.
###1117 Yeah, yeah. I guess we have.
###1125 Paper... paper... I need more paper.
###1129 Paper.
###1174 Ah !
###1180 - Hello ? - Hi, Daisy, it's me.
###1183 Oh, Tim. Where are you ?
###1185 I'm in the pub. Look, do you fancy a drink ?
###1189 Erm,... not really.
###1192 'Oh.'
###1194 Is Sarah still there ?
###1196 - No, she's gone. - Oh, I see. Right.
###1200 All right. Well, you get them in and I'll see you in a few minutes. All right, mate ?
###1217 - Hiya. - Ah ! Well...
###1220 I've been writing.
###1223 - Have you ? - Yep.
###1225 After you left, I just sat down in front of my typewriter and it just poured out.
###1229 - Really ? - Yeah.
###1231 "Winter skin care: dos and don'ts",
###1233 er, "Sex and food: the modern woman's addiction",
###1236 and "Bogling - is it the new tango ?".
###1238 Wow ! So it was research ?
###1241 Yeah.
###1242 <i>So, I'm thinking Bella for the first two, Observer for the bogling.</i>
###1253 It's probably for the best.
###1255 Yeah, I know and before you say anything, it was my decision.
###1259 - Really ? - Yeah.
###1261 She wanted me back but I said no.
###1263 Wow.
###1266 l-I just had a moment of clarity, you know. I woke up.
###1270 It's like... you know when you have an orgasm on your own ?
###1274 You know, you're sort of lying on the sofa
###1277 watching some porn movie you bought on a drunken, Ionely night in Soho,
###1280 and everything is really great.
###1283 You're getting totally turned on by these absurdly graphic images,
###1286 everything seems so right, and suddenly... bingo ! You wake up.
###1290 And you're lying there sweating,
###1293 desperately looking for the tissue which you know is still in your pocket
###1296 and the remote control which is somewhere on the floor,
###1298 and it's like walking in on yourself, you know.
###1301 It's just like "What you doing ?"
###1305 That's how I felt tonight, feeling my heart miss a beat every time the door opened.
###1309 "What the fuck are you doing ?"
###1314 Well, that's love, isn't it ? A load of old wank.
###1322 Life just isn't like the movies, is it ? You know ?
###1327 We're constantly led to believe in resolution, in the re-establishment of the ideal status quo
###1332 and it's just not true.
###1335 Happy endings are a myth
###1337 designed to make us feel better about the fact that life is a thankless struggle.
###1349 Do you want to dance ?
###1352 Do you know what ? I think I do.
###1361 Now, I got a woman who's always late
###1365 Every time we make a date
###1368 But I love her
###1371 And I want her
###1375 Gonna walk up to her gate
###1378 See if I can get it straight
###1381 Cos I love her
###1383 I'm gonna ask her
###1387 Is you is, or is you ain't my baby ?
###1394 The way you're acting lately makes me doubt
###1398 Yes, it does
###1400 You is still my baby, baby
###1406 It seems my flame in your heart's done gone out
###1421 Do you really watch porn in the flat ?
###1423 Er, only when you're out.
###1428 Sometimes when you're asleep on the beanbag.
###1436 - Can I borrow some ? - Er, yeah.
###1440 Thanks.
###1441 When you find the one you love
###1444 She's gone and made a change
###1447 But is you is, or is you ain't my baby ?
###1453 Maybe baby's found somebody new
###1459 Or is my baby
###1463 Still my baby true  ?
