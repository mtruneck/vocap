Jay Keasling: We are in a race.
the race is against time.


2
0:0:6,5 --> 0:0:8,667
We have to build
cities, we need them.


3
0:0:8,667 --> 0:0:11,625
But we have to make
them in a different way.


4
0:0:11,625 --> 0:0:13,583
Dan Kammen: We need a
wave of innovation,


5
0:0:13,583 --> 0:0:16,958
not only for our way of life,
but also for the planet.


6
0:0:16,958 --> 0:0:19,583
The consequences would
be enormous if we lose


7
0:0:19,583 --> 0:0:45,417
this battle.


8
0:0:45,417 --> 0:0:47,583
Thomas Goetz: I'm Thomas Goetz,
executive editor at Wired


9
0:0:47,583 --> 0:0:49,792
Magazine. At wired, we look


10
0:0:49,792 --> 0:0:52,83
at the innovators and
innovations that are changing


11
0:0:52,83 --> 0:0:54,0
our world. In the next


12
0:0:54,0 --> 0:0:56,625
hour, we'll see three stories
from acclaimed filmmakers about


13
0:0:56,625 --> 0:0:58,75
the future of energy.


14
0:0:58,75 --> 0:1:1,667
We'll explore cutting edge
innovations in how we drive,


15
0:1:1,667 --> 0:1:3,25
how we live,


16
0:1:3,25 --> 0:1:6,458
and, in our first story,
how we fuel our cars.


17
0:1:6,458 --> 0:1:8,208
They're all ideas
that promise to


18
0:1:8,208 --> 0:1:15,583
shape the path to
the world of 2050.


19
0:1:15,583 --> 0:1:23,958
[â™ª...]


20
0:1:23,958 --> 0:1:27,167
The world has right now,
close to a billion cars,


21
0:1:27,167 --> 0:1:28,708
and we might double the


22
0:1:28,708 --> 0:1:31,42
number of cars on
the planet by 2050.


23
0:1:31,42 --> 0:1:32,792
So if we double the number of


24
0:1:32,792 --> 0:1:36,5
vehicles, we really increase the
amount of fuel they consume, and


25
0:1:36,5 --> 0:1:40,83
that's going to have a big, big
footprint in terms of our demand


26
0:1:40,83 --> 0:1:42,917
for resources to move all
those vehicles around.


27
0:1:42,917 --> 0:1:44,625
Kay Keasling: We're pulling
up carbon that's been stored


28
0:1:44,625 --> 0:1:46,625
underground and
burning it in our


29
0:1:46,625 --> 0:1:48,667
automobiles and putting all
that carbon dioxide into the


30
0:1:48,667 --> 0:1:50,708
atmosphere.


31
0:1:50,708 --> 0:1:53,5
If we don't reduce that, we
could have changes in the


32
0:1:53,5 --> 0:1:57,75
climate that we could
never recover from.


33
0:1:57,75 --> 0:2:1,333
There's a number of forecasts
for what type of transportation


34
0:2:1,333 --> 0:2:3,5
economy we could move into.


35
0:2:3,5 --> 0:2:7,125
One vision is that we would use
more and more liquid fuels,


36
0:2:7,125 --> 0:2:9,417
another one is we'll use
more and more electricity.


37
0:2:9,417 --> 0:2:11,417
Right now, more of the


38
0:2:11,417 --> 0:2:16,167
industrial activity is
focused around liquid biofuels.


39
0:2:16,167 --> 0:2:19,917
The thing about a fuel is, its
really unparalleled on a weight


40
0:2:19,917 --> 0:2:24,5
basis how much energy
is in a gallon of fuel.


41
0:2:24,5 --> 0:2:27,25
And even if batteries
develop as some of the


42
0:2:27,25 --> 0:2:30,542
advocates hope they develop,
we're not going to see batteries


43
0:2:30,542 --> 0:2:33,125
running large trucks
and we're certainly not


44
0:2:33,125 --> 0:2:36,875
going to see an
electrified air flight.


45
0:2:36,875 --> 0:2:39,42
We're going to need
transportation fuels for


46
0:2:39,42 --> 0:2:41,583
those that will directly
replace the petroleum based


47
0:2:41,583 --> 0:2:44,375
fuels that we're using today.


48
0:2:44,375 --> 0:2:46,875
This has kicked off people
looking at a whole range of


49
0:2:46,875 --> 0:2:54,292
other alternatives to
petroleum in your tank.


50
0:2:54,292 --> 0:2:56,75
Isaias Macedo: Commercial
production of ethanol as fuel


51
0:2:56,75 --> 0:2:59,625
started in Brazil
in 1975. When we


52
0:2:59,625 --> 0:3:4,0
started the ethanol program,
nobody talked about reducing


53
0:3:4,0 --> 0:3:7,208
emissions. This was
not an issue at that time.


54
0:3:7,208 --> 0:3:10,708
First, and most important,
we didn't have money


55
0:3:10,708 --> 0:3:13,667
to buy oil anymore after
the first oil short.


56
0:3:13,667 --> 0:3:16,125
We were importers of oil.


57
0:3:16,125 --> 0:3:21,42
And today, more than 50%
of all cars use ethanol


58
0:3:21,42 --> 0:3:23,167
instead of gasoline.


59
0:3:23,167 --> 0:3:25,458
Brazil made a very conscious
choice to try to find a way to


60
0:3:25,458 --> 0:3:27,625
reduce their fossil
fuel dependence.


61
0:3:27,625 --> 0:3:30,583
And they didn't have to look
very far because Brazil's


62
0:3:30,583 --> 0:3:35,333
climate is ideal
for growing sugar cane.


63
0:3:35,333 --> 0:3:37,958
Carlos Dinucci: when you
have sugar cane plantation,


64
0:3:37,958 --> 0:3:41,708
you have only two
things to make:


65
0:3:41,708 --> 0:3:44,667
sugar and ethanol.


66
0:3:44,667 --> 0:3:49,417
My family has been in the
sugarcane business since 1955


67
0:3:49,417 --> 0:3:52,792
and about thirty
years ago, I thought


68
0:3:52,792 --> 0:3:56,542
"there's an opportunity
to make more ethanol."


69
0:3:56,542 --> 0:4:4,583
Now, we're producing 120,000
cubic meters of ethanol.


70
0:4:4,583 --> 0:4:8,792
Brazil today has very
close to 400 sugar mills.


71
0:4:8,792 --> 0:4:12,958
The overall sales
is 30 billion us dollars.


72
0:4:12,958 --> 0:4:18,375
And this number is increasing.


73
0:4:18,375 --> 0:4:21,375
If you look at how they make
ethanol and how efficient the


74
0:4:21,375 --> 0:4:25,583
process is, it's
really a model for all of us.


75
0:4:25,583 --> 0:4:28,833
They grind the plant up,
extract the sugar from the


76
0:4:28,833 --> 0:4:33,625
cane, the sugar goes into these
large fermentation tanks which


77
0:4:33,625 --> 0:4:36,833
combine sugars together with
yeast that naturally produces


78
0:4:36,833 --> 0:4:39,25
ethanol. They use the rest


79
0:4:39,25 --> 0:4:42,417
of the plant to generate heat
to distill the ethanol


80
0:4:42,417 --> 0:4:45,917
and turn it into fuel.


81
0:4:45,917 --> 0:4:49,75
They also use that heat to
generate electricity renewably,


82
0:4:49,75 --> 0:4:53,958
not putting excess carbon
dioxide into the atmosphere.


83
0:4:53,958 --> 0:4:57,167
Brazil has gotten to a point
today where they're using about


84
0:4:57,167 --> 0:5:2,375
40% less petroleum than they
would be otherwise, but Brazil


85
0:5:2,375 --> 0:5:5,167
cannot supply the whole world
with ethanol because they


86
0:5:5,167 --> 0:5:7,167
would have to cut very
strongly into food


87
0:5:7,167 --> 0:5:10,333
production and into critical
natural areas like the Amazon to


88
0:5:10,333 --> 0:5:13,0
make that happen.


89
0:5:13,0 --> 0:5:15,375
This really boils down to the
fact that there's only so much


90
0:5:15,375 --> 0:5:20,167
arable land, and growing fuel
for our gas tanks is yet another


91
0:5:20,167 --> 0:5:23,708
demand on that landscape.


92
0:5:23,708 --> 0:5:26,375
We cannot kid ourselves into
thinking that we've found a


93
0:5:26,375 --> 0:5:28,625
general solution for
the world problem.


94
0:5:28,625 --> 0:5:31,875
I think we have to face the
world in this way today.


95
0:5:31,875 --> 0:5:37,417
We have no oil in very
large quantities anymore.


96
0:5:37,417 --> 0:5:41,208
We have no coal transforming in
a clean way, in the meantime we


97
0:5:41,208 --> 0:5:44,708
have to do the best we
can, and the best at


98
0:5:44,708 --> 0:5:47,833
the moment is that
we can do biofuels.


99
0:5:47,833 --> 0:5:51,583
Sugarcane to ethanol is an
incredibly efficient process.


100
0:5:51,583 --> 0:5:54,375
You get out about
seven times the energy you put


101
0:5:54,375 --> 0:5:58,125
into growing the sugar cane.
In the US when we produce


102
0:5:58,125 --> 0:6:4,292
ethanol from corn, for every
unit of input of energy we get


103
0:6:4,292 --> 0:6:7,42
about the same amount
of energy out.


104
0:6:7,42 --> 0:6:9,917
So we're really
not gaining anything.


105
0:6:9,917 --> 0:6:11,833
We need a better process.


106
0:6:11,833 --> 0:6:13,625
We don't have to take what
nature's given us, we can


107
0:6:13,625 --> 0:6:18,0
actually engineer plants and
yeast to be more efficient.


108
0:6:18,0 --> 0:6:19,542
And that's the basis


109
0:6:19,542 --> 0:6:22,208
for a lot of the work
that we're doing now.


110
0:6:22,208 --> 0:6:26,25
What we need to look at though,
is which of the pathways to come


111
0:6:26,25 --> 0:6:28,833
out of this are not
only good financially,


112
0:6:28,833 --> 0:6:31,458
but those that are also
good for sustainability.


113
0:6:31,458 --> 0:6:37,583
And this equation is
really wide open right now.


114
0:6:37,583 --> 0:6:40,75
We are in a race
to develop fuels.


115
0:6:40,75 --> 0:6:43,333
The race isn't with
other countries, the race


116
0:6:43,333 --> 0:6:53,0
is against time.


117
0:6:53,0 --> 0:6:55,625
Cristiano Borges: To meet the
immediate and future demands, we


118
0:6:55,625 --> 0:7:4,83
made the energy solution
spring from the ground.


119
0:7:4,83 --> 0:7:6,625
Luis Scoffone: Brazil is the
most efficient ethanol producing


120
0:7:6,625 --> 0:7:9,83
country in the world. Sugarcane


121
0:7:9,83 --> 0:7:14,0
alcohol from Brazil can reduce
the total carbon footprint by up


122
0:7:14,0 --> 0:7:23,958
to 70%, compared with gasoline.


123
0:7:23,958 --> 0:7:27,417
The biggest challenge for fuel
providers, and car manufacturers


124
0:7:27,417 --> 0:7:32,792
is to reduce CO2 emissions
over the next twenty years.


125
0:7:32,792 --> 0:7:36,125
Demand for mobility
will continue to grow.


126
0:7:36,125 --> 0:7:38,917
We believe that
biofuels are very


127
0:7:38,917 --> 0:7:42,875
important because they
help in an immediate way.


128
0:7:42,875 --> 0:7:46,333
All forms of fuel are going
to be needed; hydrocarbons,


129
0:7:46,333 --> 0:7:49,375
natural gas, biofuels,
all of them are going to


130
0:7:49,375 --> 0:8:10,583
be part of the energy needs for
the future of transportation.


131
0:8:10,583 --> 0:8:13,917
Brazil has been very successful
at taking a resource they had


132
0:8:13,917 --> 0:8:17,208
and finding the process
to make that into


133
0:8:17,208 --> 0:8:20,125
ethanol and people call
those first generation


134
0:8:20,125 --> 0:8:23,625
biofuels. We have lots
of lab work around


135
0:8:23,625 --> 0:8:25,625
the world that
are looking at the


136
0:8:25,625 --> 0:8:27,833
second generation and that's
generally turning cellulosic


137
0:8:27,833 --> 0:8:32,75
material from for example
weeds, into biofuels.


138
0:8:32,75 --> 0:8:35,83
And the United States
is very much at the


139
0:8:35,83 --> 0:8:42,583
forefront of the innovation
part of the equation.


140
0:8:42,583 --> 0:8:46,708
For centuries we've been using
yeast to consume glucose and


141
0:8:46,708 --> 0:8:49,25
produce wine and beer.


142
0:8:49,25 --> 0:8:52,42
We're trying to do something
very similar, only we're


143
0:8:52,42 --> 0:8:55,208
engineering the yeast
to consume that glucose


144
0:8:55,208 --> 0:8:59,417
and turn it into a fuel
or drug or chemical.


145
0:8:59,417 --> 0:9:3,208
We call this synthetic biology
and when i started in this area,


146
0:9:3,208 --> 0:9:4,917
many of my colleagues
said "Oh Jay, this is


147
0:9:4,917 --> 0:9:7,25
great work, but where's
the application, what


148
0:9:7,25 --> 0:9:11,833
are you going to do with
these tools?" Who cares?


149
0:9:11,833 --> 0:9:14,125
Malaria is an enormous problem.


150
0:9:14,125 --> 0:9:17,125
In any one year,
a million or so people die of


151
0:9:17,125 --> 0:9:20,42
the disease and most of them
are children under the age of 5.


152
0:9:20,42 --> 0:9:24,42
So we thought this was a great
opportunity to engineer yeast to


153
0:9:24,42 --> 0:9:28,25
produce an antimalarial
drug called artemisinin.


154
0:9:28,25 --> 0:9:31,25
This drug is derived
from plants right


155
0:9:31,25 --> 0:9:34,292
now, but its too expensive for
people in the developing world.


156
0:9:34,292 --> 0:9:37,792
So my laboratory engineered
yeast to produce small


157
0:9:37,792 --> 0:9:42,542
quantities of artemisinin, now
that process is being scaled up


158
0:9:42,542 --> 0:9:44,458
and we'll have this drug
on the market shortly,


159
0:9:44,458 --> 0:9:48,125
but at a substantially
reduced cost.


160
0:9:48,125 --> 0:9:50,292
It turns out that that
anti-malarial drug is a


161
0:9:50,292 --> 0:9:53,167
hydrocarbon and it's
very similar in


162
0:9:53,167 --> 0:9:56,917
many ways to diesel fuel.


163
0:9:56,917 --> 0:9:59,167
We thought, gosh we can
turn our attention now to


164
0:9:59,167 --> 0:10:2,625
fuels. We can make a few changes
in that microbe to turn it into


165
0:10:2,625 --> 0:10:6,42
a fuel-producing microbe.


166
0:10:6,42 --> 0:10:10,0
If we imagine that glucose is
going to be our new petroleum,


167
0:10:10,0 --> 0:10:12,42
we need a source
for that glucose.


168
0:10:12,42 --> 0:10:14,625
So the crops that we're
looking at are crops like


169
0:10:14,625 --> 0:10:16,708
switchgrass.


170
0:10:16,708 --> 0:10:19,333
This is a native grass, it grows
without a lot of water and on


171
0:10:19,333 --> 0:10:24,125
marginal lands. we could
turn it into energy farms.


172
0:10:24,125 --> 0:10:27,42
The challenge though, is
that unlike sugar cane, it's


173
0:10:27,42 --> 0:10:30,583
very difficult to get the
sugar out of that biomass.


174
0:10:30,583 --> 0:10:34,25
So we use what we call a
pre-treatment process to extract


175
0:10:34,25 --> 0:10:36,5
the glucose from the plant,
and then we feed that


176
0:10:36,5 --> 0:10:39,75
glucose to a yeast
that we've engineered to


177
0:10:39,75 --> 0:10:41,625
produce hydrocarbons.


178
0:10:41,625 --> 0:10:44,792
And that yeast takes in the
sugar, and it changes its


179
0:10:44,792 --> 0:10:50,542
composition and gives us
this high-energy molecule.


180
0:10:50,542 --> 0:10:52,375
They float to the top,
you skim them off,


181
0:10:52,375 --> 0:10:59,833
you put them in your tank.


182
0:10:59,833 --> 0:11:3,833
But it takes a lot of work to
get from that small test tube


183
0:11:3,833 --> 0:11:5,542
all the way up into


184
0:11:5,542 --> 0:11:7,542
the million-gallon tank,
so we have to give it time.


185
0:11:7,542 --> 0:11:9,625
But I think that some of the
discoveries that are happening


186
0:11:9,625 --> 0:11:17,42
might be applied by
the end of the decade.


187
0:11:17,42 --> 0:11:19,875
In terms of a sustainable
equation for the planet, the


188
0:11:19,875 --> 0:11:23,833
role of biofuels
is quite tricky.


189
0:11:23,833 --> 0:11:27,125
There are a variety of crops
that do not compete directly


190
0:11:27,125 --> 0:11:30,75
with food, and finding
ways to utilize those


191
0:11:30,75 --> 0:11:33,625
types of crops first,
that's very attractive.


192
0:11:33,625 --> 0:11:36,458
So solving the science is
part of the story, but then


193
0:11:36,458 --> 0:11:40,583
evaluating all of the new
fuels in terms of the land-use


194
0:11:40,583 --> 0:11:44,125
impacts that they could
have, that is an even


195
0:11:44,125 --> 0:11:47,875
harder story than
doing the good science.


196
0:11:47,875 --> 0:11:51,417
Imagine that you could have one
process that could take in


197
0:11:51,417 --> 0:11:55,375
sunlight and carbon dioxide
and turn it into fuel.


198
0:11:55,375 --> 0:11:57,375
And imagine if that
didn't involve growing


199
0:11:57,375 --> 0:12:2,167
anything at all.


200
0:12:2,167 --> 0:12:4,458
Nate Lewis: The synthetic
biologists are trying to take


201
0:12:4,458 --> 0:12:9,958
plants and make them do things
that they wouldn't normally do.


202
0:12:9,958 --> 0:12:12,167
On the other hand,
materials chemists, like


203
0:12:12,167 --> 0:12:17,333
myself, want to do artificial
photosynthesis to improve on the


204
0:12:17,333 --> 0:12:33,75
process that nature does
in real photosynthesis.


205
0:12:33,75 --> 0:12:36,792
We should follow the blue print
of plants converting sunlight


206
0:12:36,792 --> 0:12:43,333
into fuel, but take the approach
that it could be much simpler.


207
0:12:43,333 --> 0:12:45,0
All we really need
is a light absorber


208
0:12:45,0 --> 0:12:46,667
that absorbs sunlight.


209
0:12:46,667 --> 0:12:51,83
We also need a catalyst
like iron or nickel.


210
0:12:51,83 --> 0:12:53,958
So when you see the hydrogen
coming off of the photo-active


211
0:12:53,958 --> 0:12:58,125
material, that's an
example of a semi-conductor


212
0:12:58,125 --> 0:13:1,83
breaking the chemical
bonds of water to make


213
0:13:1,83 --> 0:13:2,917
hydrogen and oxygen.


214
0:13:2,917 --> 0:13:6,167
Ultimately, our pieces are
going to be contained in


215
0:13:6,167 --> 0:13:10,417
something that is easy to
roll out like bubble wrap,


216
0:13:10,417 --> 0:13:13,25
where in would come
sunlight and water.


217
0:13:13,25 --> 0:13:16,42
You would vent the oxygen
to the air, but the bottom


218
0:13:16,42 --> 0:13:19,792
would wick out your liquid or
gaseous fuel, that then you


219
0:13:19,792 --> 0:13:35,458
could collect and use for our
cars and planes and storage.


220
0:13:35,458 --> 0:13:39,542
Our goal is within two years,
to have the first artificial


221
0:13:39,542 --> 0:13:42,833
photosynthesis solarfuels
generator that we can hold in


222
0:13:42,833 --> 0:13:49,333
our hands. and then, get
to scale beyond that time.


223
0:13:49,333 --> 0:13:51,708
We're certainly not good at
predicting the future, but to


224
0:13:51,708 --> 0:13:54,875
me, electric vehicles look
like a sustainable option.


225
0:13:54,875 --> 0:13:56,958
We've heard proposals
about things as


226
0:13:56,958 --> 0:14:0,125
far-fetched as nuclear power
planes, and even some proposals


227
0:14:0,125 --> 0:14:2,958
to move freight around with
lighter-than-air vehicles.


228
0:14:2,958 --> 0:14:5,875
And so if the
future in 2050 does


229
0:14:5,875 --> 0:14:8,417
include a fair amount of oil,
what it means would be that we


230
0:14:8,417 --> 0:14:11,375
haven't deployed
as many of these clean


231
0:14:11,375 --> 0:14:16,292
technologies as we already
know are possible.


232
0:14:16,292 --> 0:14:19,583
If you think about how long it's
taken for us to build up the


233
0:14:19,583 --> 0:14:23,792
petroleum industry, we can't
hope to reverse that overnight.


234
0:14:23,792 --> 0:14:26,417
It's a huge change in
our infrastructure.


235
0:14:26,417 --> 0:14:29,42
Yes, we should have been
working on it 30 years ago.


236
0:14:29,42 --> 0:14:31,0
We didn't.


237
0:14:31,0 --> 0:14:32,917
We're trying to make up for
that, and that means basic


238
0:14:32,917 --> 0:14:35,958
research needs to be done now
and by as many people as


239
0:14:35,958 --> 0:14:38,667
possible. We have a long way to


240
0:14:38,667 --> 0:14:48,708
go, but I'm confident
that we'll get there.


241
0:14:48,708 --> 0:14:52,417
In the future, 3d maps are going
to help people get places more


242
0:14:52,417 --> 0:15:1,583
efficiently.


243
0:15:1,583 --> 0:15:4,83
As we just saw, the race to
produce cleaner energy is


244
0:15:4,83 --> 0:15:5,75
charging ahead. In the


245
0:15:5,75 --> 0:15:8,375
meantime, demand for
cars continues to climb.


246
0:15:8,375 --> 0:15:10,208
By 2050, it's predicted there


247
0:15:10,208 --> 0:15:12,25
will be two billion
cars on the planet,


248
0:15:12,25 --> 0:15:14,542
and fuel consumption
will have tripled.


249
0:15:14,542 --> 0:15:16,417
To keep pace, we'll
have to radically


250
0:15:16,417 --> 0:15:18,42
change the way we drive.


251
0:15:18,42 --> 0:15:26,958
Here's our next story,
'Driven by design.'


252
0:15:26,958 --> 0:15:28,5
Asaaf Biderman: The
automobile came around,


253
0:15:28,5 --> 0:15:30,458
in many ways it was the future.


254
0:15:30,458 --> 0:15:32,958
We thought of it as one of the
more positive changes that had


255
0:15:32,958 --> 0:15:35,625
happened to society.
Suddenly, our ability to get a


256
0:15:35,625 --> 0:15:38,5
job changed, we can
live farther away with


257
0:15:38,5 --> 0:15:41,333
bigger plots of land, with
better quality of living.


258
0:15:41,333 --> 0:15:44,208
It all looked quite good.


259
0:15:44,208 --> 0:15:48,333
But there are limitations
to swearing by the car.


260
0:15:48,333 --> 0:15:50,25
If it gets congested,
your quality of


261
0:15:50,25 --> 0:15:52,125
life drops immediately.


262
0:15:52,125 --> 0:15:54,375
You have to spend
so long in the car.


263
0:15:54,375 --> 0:15:57,208
It's a very inefficient
use of fuel consumption.


264
0:15:57,208 --> 0:15:59,333
Things stop making
sense all of a sudden.


265
0:15:59,333 --> 0:16:1,208
It doesn't bring you closer
to where you want to get, it


266
0:16:1,208 --> 0:16:4,5
actually, sometimes
brings you farther.


267
0:16:4,5 --> 0:16:7,583
Narrator: The average American
spends nearly 300 hours a year


268
0:16:7,583 --> 0:16:9,375
in their car.


269
0:16:9,375 --> 0:16:12,167
38 of them stuck in traffic.


270
0:16:12,167 --> 0:16:15,875
Annually, congestion
consumes over $1 billion in


271
0:16:15,875 --> 0:16:19,25
gasoline in the
United States alone.


272
0:16:19,25 --> 0:16:21,458
The inefficiency
caused by traffic, both


273
0:16:21,458 --> 0:16:28,125
financial and
personal, is enormous.


274
0:16:28,125 --> 0:16:30,208
Dirk Sheehan and
Carmen White's story


275
0:16:30,208 --> 0:16:33,625
is not that unusual today.


276
0:16:33,625 --> 0:16:36,375
Carmen White: Dirk works an hour
and a half away in Warrenville,


277
0:16:36,375 --> 0:16:38,458
Illinois. Generally he wouldn't


278
0:16:38,458 --> 0:16:42,667
leave work until 6 or 6:30 and I
would say usual time for him to


279
0:16:42,667 --> 0:16:45,5
get home is around 8.


280
0:16:45,5 --> 0:16:46,958
You all done?


281
0:16:46,958 --> 0:16:48,792
Thanks, buddy.


282
0:16:48,792 --> 0:16:50,542
Dirk Sheehan: Usually when I
wake up I'm the only one up.


283
0:16:50,542 --> 0:16:53,292
Sometimes the kids wake
up with my routine.


284
0:16:53,292 --> 0:16:57,5
More often than not, I don't
see them in the morning.


285
0:16:57,5 --> 0:17:0,0
I think about my commute
when I wake up.


286
0:17:0,0 --> 0:17:3,333
I check the traffic report to
see if there's any delays.


287
0:17:3,333 --> 0:17:5,0
The worst case
scenario, it takes me


288
0:17:5,0 --> 0:17:7,208
two hours to get to work.


289
0:17:7,208 --> 0:17:10,458
We are already so limited in the
amount of time he can spend with


290
0:17:10,458 --> 0:17:15,792
the kids, and our
expenses are crazy high.


291
0:17:15,792 --> 0:17:18,25
We're spending $400
a month on gas.


292
0:17:18,25 --> 0:17:21,167
It takes away from our food
budget, and we never paid for


293
0:17:21,167 --> 0:17:24,333
gas like that before. Ever.


294
0:17:24,333 --> 0:17:26,625
If there's technology that would
allow me to spend less time in


295
0:17:26,625 --> 0:17:29,542
the car, spend less
money on gas, and spend


296
0:17:29,542 --> 0:17:36,583
more time at home,
I'd be all for that.


297
0:17:36,583 --> 0:17:38,708
Mike Finn: The cost of traffic
is people's time, it's fuel


298
0:17:38,708 --> 0:17:43,0
wasted, it's an emotional
toll, it's a frustration.


299
0:17:43,0 --> 0:17:46,0
Utilizing the roads
more intelligently is a much


300
0:17:46,0 --> 0:17:49,458
more efficient approach to
the inability to have


301
0:17:49,458 --> 0:17:54,292
supply keep up
with traffic demand.


302
0:17:54,292 --> 0:17:55,917
John Leonard: If you took a
satellite picture of the


303
0:17:55,917 --> 0:17:58,83
highway, you can see that


304
0:17:58,83 --> 0:18:0,167
there's actually
a lot of open space.


305
0:18:0,167 --> 0:18:3,542
If we had the technology for
cars to drive more closely,


306
0:18:3,542 --> 0:18:6,25
but safely, then you could
increase the utilization of the


307
0:18:6,25 --> 0:18:8,375
road network.


308
0:18:8,375 --> 0:18:11,25
What this means is that to be
more efficient, to use less


309
0:18:11,25 --> 0:18:15,417
fuel, we need to see
the road differently.


310
0:18:15,417 --> 0:18:17,625
We need cars that can
navigate through the urban


311
0:18:17,625 --> 0:18:25,167
landscape in a
radically different way.


312
0:18:25,167 --> 0:18:27,625
Cliff Fox: Maps in the future
are going to be able to help


313
0:18:27,625 --> 0:18:31,833
people get places either more
safely or more efficiently.


314
0:18:31,833 --> 0:18:35,375
Today, just helps you get
from point A to point B.


315
0:18:35,375 --> 0:18:38,708
But, what if I want to get
someplace and use the least


316
0:18:38,708 --> 0:18:40,542
amount of fuel possible?


317
0:18:40,542 --> 0:18:43,83
Or, if I've got a hybrid
vehicle, and I want to make sure


318
0:18:43,83 --> 0:18:44,958
I've got plenty of
charge to not only get


319
0:18:44,958 --> 0:18:47,167
there but to get back home?


320
0:18:47,167 --> 0:18:49,125
So, information
that is gonna help people


321
0:18:49,125 --> 0:18:52,333
achieve the more efficient
or the safer route is


322
0:18:52,333 --> 0:18:55,75
more detailed information about
the road than a lot of people


323
0:18:55,75 --> 0:18:59,125
realize is possible
to collect today.


324
0:18:59,125 --> 0:19:2,292
Here in Chicago, Nokia's
location & commerce unit is


325
0:19:2,292 --> 0:19:5,708
developing the next
generation of mapping.


326
0:19:5,708 --> 0:19:9,958
Lidar, sonar, 360-degree video,


327
0:19:9,958 --> 0:19:15,417
all are components of what Nokia
calls - digital mapping.


328
0:19:15,417 --> 0:19:20,125
We use 64 lasers that rotate and
they collect data in a 3D way


329
0:19:20,125 --> 0:19:22,5
about the world.


330
0:19:22,5 --> 0:19:25,292
It creates what we call a
point cloud of information.


331
0:19:25,292 --> 0:19:28,125
That point cloud
allows us to measure distances


332
0:19:28,125 --> 0:19:31,333
then between the points
that we collect.


333
0:19:31,333 --> 0:19:35,625
That system combined with the
cameras, with higher precision


334
0:19:35,625 --> 0:19:38,167
location detection
through inertial measurement


335
0:19:38,167 --> 0:19:40,75
units, that whole data
system allows us to


336
0:19:40,75 --> 0:19:44,583
collect 1.3 million
points of data per second.


337
0:19:44,583 --> 0:19:46,708
Probably within 2-3 years,


338
0:19:46,708 --> 0:19:49,25
you're gonna see 3D maps that
are gonna integrate the traffic


339
0:19:49,25 --> 0:19:51,958
information into your
routing, to help you understand.


340
0:19:51,958 --> 0:19:53,792
If I've got 5
different routes to take,


341
0:19:53,792 --> 0:19:55,958
which one is the most efficient
today, given the way the


342
0:19:55,958 --> 0:19:58,417
stoplights are running, given
the way traffic is running.


343
0:19:58,417 --> 0:20:0,417
All of those factors are gonna


344
0:20:0,417 --> 0:20:2,833
be taken into consideration to
make sure I've got the best


345
0:20:2,833 --> 0:20:4,542
route.


346
0:20:4,542 --> 0:20:6,875
But better mapping that can
integrate topography,


347
0:20:6,875 --> 0:20:12,0
infrastructure, and density is
only part of the answer.


348
0:20:12,0 --> 0:20:14,792
Another key to improving
transport efficiency is


349
0:20:14,792 --> 0:20:19,167
building cars
that drive themselves.


350
0:20:19,167 --> 0:20:24,125
Autonomous vehicle technology
has a tremendous potential to


351
0:20:24,125 --> 0:20:28,583
improve efficiency of
our road infrastructure.


352
0:20:28,583 --> 0:20:31,875
By removing humans from the
equation, we eliminate all the


353
0:20:31,875 --> 0:20:35,25
things we do wrong behind the
wheel - speeding, changing


354
0:20:35,25 --> 0:20:37,208
lanes too often, merging


355
0:20:37,208 --> 0:20:43,667
haphazardly; and by marrying
them with sophisticated 3D maps,


356
0:20:43,667 --> 0:20:50,125
we can make driving safer
and more energy efficient.


357
0:20:50,125 --> 0:20:52,75
That next generation
vehicle is being


358
0:20:52,75 --> 0:20:59,667
built right now by Swedish
trucking company, Scania.


359
0:20:59,667 --> 0:21:2,125
Tony Sandberg: The solution, as
we see it, is that the vehicles


360
0:21:2,125 --> 0:21:4,708
can utilize intelligent maps.


361
0:21:4,708 --> 0:21:7,875
3D maps with
traffic information.


362
0:21:7,875 --> 0:21:10,125
The vehicles will
be intelligent and


363
0:21:10,125 --> 0:21:11,917
communicate with each other.


364
0:21:11,917 --> 0:21:13,5
They will talk to each
other, they will talk to the


365
0:21:13,5 --> 0:21:17,333
infrastructure.


366
0:21:17,333 --> 0:21:30,25
And we will see
autonomously-driven vehicles.


367
0:21:30,25 --> 0:21:34,542
The goal was to have multiple
robots and see if they could go


368
0:21:34,542 --> 0:21:44,0
60 miles fully autonomously.


369
0:21:44,0 --> 0:21:45,833
Helen Taylor:
My name's Helen Taylor.


370
0:21:45,833 --> 0:21:47,667
My husband John and I,
we're very passionate about


371
0:21:47,667 --> 0:21:53,667
fuel economy.


372
0:21:53,667 --> 0:21:55,375
John Taylor: Yea it's great to
break world records, but that's


373
0:21:55,375 --> 0:21:57,83
not the be all and end all now.


374
0:21:57,83 --> 0:21:59,375
It's more important
to educate people.


375
0:21:59,375 --> 0:22:2,0
Together we're showing
drivers around the world simple


376
0:22:2,0 --> 0:22:5,417
techniques to improve
their fuel efficiency.


377
0:22:5,417 --> 0:22:8,917
We run these education programs,
get people on the road with us,


378
0:22:8,917 --> 0:22:12,458
and we finally tweak
their driving techniques.


379
0:22:12,458 --> 0:22:14,292
Things like just
checking your tire


380
0:22:14,292 --> 0:22:16,42
pressures before you
even get into your car.


381
0:22:16,42 --> 0:22:18,0
For every one psi your tires are


382
0:22:18,0 --> 0:22:20,75
under inflated, you're wasting
3% of your fuel efficiency.


383
0:22:20,75 --> 0:22:22,417
And the difference


384
0:22:22,417 --> 0:22:27,333
between 65 and 75 miles
per hour is a saving of 23%.


385
0:22:27,333 --> 0:22:29,667
When you talk to the general
public, they're very surprised


386
0:22:29,667 --> 0:22:32,0
that an energy company,
like Shell, is trying


387
0:22:32,0 --> 0:22:34,25
to educate people on
how to save money,


388
0:22:34,25 --> 0:22:36,208
how to reduce CO2 emissions.


389
0:22:36,208 --> 0:22:40,0
And here we have Shell sending
us around the world to do that.


390
0:22:40,0 --> 0:22:42,292
You always hope when you're on
this planet that you can make a


391
0:22:42,292 --> 0:22:44,375
real difference
in people's lives.


392
0:22:44,375 --> 0:22:46,125
When you get emails
from people saying "I've


393
0:22:46,125 --> 0:22:48,375
saved this amount of money this
year, now I can put food on the


394
0:22:48,375 --> 0:23:1,5
table", then you know you are
really making a difference.


395
0:23:1,5 --> 0:23:4,42
By displaying traffic density
in the urban infrastructure


396
0:23:4,42 --> 0:23:6,83
in a revolutionary way,


397
0:23:6,83 --> 0:23:11,25
3D digital maps will help create
a more fuel-efficient future.


398
0:23:11,25 --> 0:23:14,83
But these technologies are
limited by the drivers who sit


399
0:23:14,83 --> 0:23:17,417
behind the wheel. Some
believe, that for cars and


400
0:23:17,417 --> 0:23:20,417
trucks to be truly
energy-efficient, they will need


401
0:23:20,417 --> 0:23:23,833
to drive themselves.


402
0:23:23,833 --> 0:23:26,958
The technology's coming into
play, through sensors and


403
0:23:26,958 --> 0:23:32,292
capabilities for cars
to drive autonomously.


404
0:23:32,292 --> 0:23:35,875
In 2007, the United States'
department of defense held a


405
0:23:35,875 --> 0:23:39,0
competition to see
if a completely autonomous,


406
0:23:39,0 --> 0:23:42,583
self-driving vehicle
was possible.


407
0:23:42,583 --> 0:23:45,333
DARPA stands for the Defense
Advanced Research Projects


408
0:23:45,333 --> 0:23:49,5
Agency. They had a competition
to develop self-driving robots


409
0:23:49,5 --> 0:23:52,208
that could drive
themselves in traffic.


410
0:23:52,208 --> 0:23:55,708
The goal was to have multiple
robots, turn them loose


411
0:23:55,708 --> 0:23:59,542
on a course, and see if they
could go sixty miles in six


412
0:23:59,542 --> 0:24:4,167
hours, fully autonomously.


413
0:24:4,167 --> 0:24:8,42
Driving may be one of the most
complex things we do every day.


414
0:24:8,42 --> 0:24:12,42
Drivers make dozens of
decisions at any given moment.


415
0:24:12,42 --> 0:24:14,375
One study found that drivers


416
0:24:14,375 --> 0:24:19,75
Were exposed to over 1,300 items
of information per minute.


417
0:24:19,75 --> 0:24:22,833
We make so many decisions when
we're driving without even


418
0:24:22,833 --> 0:24:24,708
thinking about it.


419
0:24:24,708 --> 0:24:27,833
So in creating our vehicle,
a great component of the


420
0:24:27,833 --> 0:24:30,417
enterprise was
developing software to handle


421
0:24:30,417 --> 0:24:34,42
lots of sensors,
feeding lots of data, and


422
0:24:34,42 --> 0:24:36,667
generating a bunch of potential
paths that the vehicle might


423
0:24:36,667 --> 0:24:39,792
follow. And even
though the robot doesn't have


424
0:24:39,792 --> 0:24:43,875
the ability to predict
the future, by using this


425
0:24:43,875 --> 0:24:47,667
fast random path generation,
the robot could anticipate a


426
0:24:47,667 --> 0:24:50,417
potential accident
and choose a path to avoid it


427
0:24:50,417 --> 0:24:53,83
because its always
thinking about what things


428
0:24:53,83 --> 0:24:59,167
could the car do next.


429
0:24:59,167 --> 0:25:2,208
No one expects millions of
cars driving themselves anytime


430
0:25:2,208 --> 0:25:5,708
soon. But there is a
place where self-navigating


431
0:25:5,708 --> 0:25:8,417
technologies are being
optimized to create the


432
0:25:8,417 --> 0:25:11,792
vehicle of the future.


433
0:25:11,792 --> 0:25:14,5
We're on the Scania test
track outside Stockholm,


434
0:25:14,5 --> 0:25:16,458
where we have basically,


435
0:25:16,458 --> 0:25:19,0
it looks like a highway but it's
a separate test track where we


436
0:25:19,0 --> 0:25:21,167
conduct our own experiments.


437
0:25:21,167 --> 0:25:24,292
Scania, the Swedish trucking
company, has recently begun


438
0:25:24,292 --> 0:25:28,75
testing its next generation
of long-haul truck, utilizing


439
0:25:28,75 --> 0:25:32,167
radar, sonar, and
intelligent mapping.


440
0:25:32,167 --> 0:25:37,708
They've been able to drastically
reduce fuel consumption.


441
0:25:37,708 --> 0:25:39,833
Jonas Martensson: We have this
example with platooning, where


442
0:25:39,833 --> 0:25:44,792
will make use of the reduction
in air resistance, or air drag,


443
0:25:44,792 --> 0:25:47,125
that you get from driving
close to each other with


444
0:25:47,125 --> 0:25:50,292
heavy duty vehicles.


445
0:25:50,292 --> 0:25:53,0
And in order to control
this, you need to know


446
0:25:53,0 --> 0:25:55,667
where the other vehicles are,
their position, their velocity,


447
0:25:55,667 --> 0:25:58,333
their actions
in the near future.


448
0:25:58,333 --> 0:26:1,375
And to be very close to the
vehicle ahead of you, it


449
0:26:1,375 --> 0:26:4,958
requires that you have
a very accurate control.


450
0:26:4,958 --> 0:26:7,875
If you look at robotics broadly,
there's a wonderful set of


451
0:26:7,875 --> 0:26:10,83
research of people
looking at schooling fish and


452
0:26:10,83 --> 0:26:12,875
trying to develop the
ability for robots to work


453
0:26:12,875 --> 0:26:14,792
together like that.


454
0:26:14,792 --> 0:26:17,125
So there are wonderful
examples from nature of how


455
0:26:17,125 --> 0:26:20,958
cooperation can lead to more
efficient resource utilization.


456
0:26:20,958 --> 0:26:23,83
Jonas Hofstedt: You can see it
when people are competing in


457
0:26:23,83 --> 0:26:28,292
Tour de France. They platoon
to reduce air drag.


458
0:26:28,292 --> 0:26:32,333
They are not bicycling behind
each other that close because


459
0:26:32,333 --> 0:26:37,5
it's fun, or because they are
racing, it is because they are


460
0:26:37,5 --> 0:26:40,125
reducing air drag


461
0:26:40,125 --> 0:26:42,75
sitting behind
the man who is leading.


462
0:26:42,75 --> 0:26:47,0
A truck traveling 55 miles per
hour expends half its energy


463
0:26:47,0 --> 0:26:49,375
just to move
the air around it.


464
0:26:49,375 --> 0:26:52,458
At 65 miles per hour, that
number jumps to almost


465
0:26:52,458 --> 0:26:54,708
two-thirds.


466
0:26:54,708 --> 0:26:58,667
Even if platooning can reduce
the energy used by 10 percent,


467
0:26:58,667 --> 0:27:3,167
the savings
would be substantial.


468
0:27:3,167 --> 0:27:6,708
If a vehicle in front of another
vehicle wants to brake,


469
0:27:6,708 --> 0:27:10,875
it immediately sends out
the brake message to the other


470
0:27:10,875 --> 0:27:16,583
vehicles, so they actually
brake at the same time.


471
0:27:16,583 --> 0:27:19,83
Hassad Alem: The way we do this
is by, we have an automated


472
0:27:19,83 --> 0:27:21,167
system. so now for instance,


473
0:27:21,167 --> 0:27:23,375
if i take my feet off the
acceleration pedal, and turn the


474
0:27:23,375 --> 0:27:26,333
system on, the
velocity is automatically


475
0:27:26,333 --> 0:27:28,792
governed by getting
information from the vehicle


476
0:27:28,792 --> 0:27:31,583
ahead through
its wireless system.


477
0:27:31,583 --> 0:27:33,708
We want these
vehicles to maintain a


478
0:27:33,708 --> 0:27:35,708
short relative distance.


479
0:27:35,708 --> 0:27:37,667
So through this system,
we can reduce fuel


480
0:27:37,667 --> 0:27:42,417
consumption by utulizing
the air drag reduction by 10%.


481
0:27:42,417 --> 0:27:45,0
and 10% would mean you
would be able to save


482
0:27:45,0 --> 0:27:48,125
approximately 8,000 Euros
per single heavyduty


483
0:27:48,125 --> 0:27:57,833
vehicle per year.


484
0:27:57,833 --> 0:28:0,833
It may be sometime before
autonomous vehicles make up the


485
0:28:0,833 --> 0:28:4,583
majority of cars on
America's highways.


486
0:28:4,583 --> 0:28:7,958
Nevertheless, some of these
technologies are already


487
0:28:7,958 --> 0:28:11,208
making their way into our lives.


488
0:28:11,208 --> 0:28:14,42
Now this polar
baby wants to sleep.


489
0:28:14,42 --> 0:28:15,958
Do you get to pick out books
every day or is it just...


490
0:28:15,958 --> 0:28:18,5
I get to pick out
books sometimes.


491
0:28:18,5 --> 0:28:20,333
Okay.


492
0:28:20,333 --> 0:28:23,5
When we look toward the future,
the systems will absolutely make


493
0:28:23,5 --> 0:28:26,208
it safer and more
efficient and less


494
0:28:26,208 --> 0:28:28,792
costly for you and also
make your life easier


495
0:28:28,792 --> 0:28:31,25
because you're spending
less time on the roads.


496
0:28:31,25 --> 0:28:33,667
The city begins to talk, begins
to tell you where is there


497
0:28:33,667 --> 0:28:36,75
congestion, what's going on
in different areas of town?


498
0:28:36,75 --> 0:28:39,375
Suddenly the car
becomes a part of a


499
0:28:39,375 --> 0:28:41,375
much bigger ecosystem.


500
0:28:41,375 --> 0:28:43,625
We can look at how cars
interact with other cars,


501
0:28:43,625 --> 0:28:45,833
how cars interact with
infrastructure and us, the


502
0:28:45,833 --> 0:28:47,917
drivers, can start to make


503
0:28:47,917 --> 0:28:50,792
smart decisions about
how to move around.


504
0:28:50,792 --> 0:28:57,42
Suddenly, mobility becomes
a whole other thing.


505
0:28:57,42 --> 0:28:58,667
Paul Goldberger: No matter how
much money they have, no matter


506
0:28:58,667 --> 0:29:0,458
how much oil they have,


507
0:29:0,458 --> 0:29:11,83
everybody has to go in
a different direction.


508
0:29:11,83 --> 0:29:13,208
We've seen that changing
the way we drive can improve


509
0:29:13,208 --> 0:29:15,208
transportation efficiencies.


510
0:29:15,208 --> 0:29:18,83
But what if we change the way we
build and live in our cities?


511
0:29:18,83 --> 0:29:21,75
That's the subject of our next
story, "Searching for Utopia".


512
0:29:21,75 --> 0:29:23,417
We'll travel to the
United Arab Emirates, and


513
0:29:23,417 --> 0:29:25,667
discover a city rising
out of the desert.


514
0:29:25,667 --> 0:29:30,958
Let's take a look.


515
0:29:30,958 --> 0:29:34,875
From the beginning,
we've dreamed of Utopia.


516
0:29:34,875 --> 0:29:36,708
A place where we could live in


517
0:29:36,708 --> 0:29:42,625
harmony with each other,
and in balance with nature.


518
0:29:42,625 --> 0:29:45,125
Many have imagined it,


519
0:29:45,125 --> 0:29:58,583
tried to design it, but the
dream always slipped away.


520
0:29:58,583 --> 0:30:1,83
Then, I heard they were
building a new city called


521
0:30:1,83 --> 0:30:7,417
"Masdar", near Abu Dhabi,
in the Arabian desert.


522
0:30:7,417 --> 0:30:10,25
It sounded like an
unlikely place for Utopia,


523
0:30:10,25 --> 0:30:22,917
and I wanted to see it.


524
0:30:22,917 --> 0:30:27,167
The last half-century has been a
pretty bad time for the making


525
0:30:27,167 --> 0:30:31,208
of cities, mostly.


526
0:30:31,208 --> 0:30:35,83
The natural tendency has been
to accommodate to the automobile


527
0:30:35,83 --> 0:30:37,75
more than anything else.


528
0:30:37,75 --> 0:30:42,292
Try walking around
Abu Dhabi, itâ€™s impossible,


529
0:30:42,292 --> 0:30:45,83
you have to take
a car everywhere.


530
0:30:45,83 --> 0:30:48,917
Dubai, the same thing.


531
0:30:48,917 --> 0:30:51,375
They are among
the least pedestrian-friendly


532
0:30:51,375 --> 0:30:55,42
places in the world,
they are not green by any


533
0:30:55,42 --> 0:31:3,625
other measure either, and these
are not easy things to fix.


534
0:31:3,625 --> 0:31:5,75
Masdar is still under
construction, and it doesn't


535
0:31:5,75 --> 0:31:7,833
look like much from the highway.


536
0:31:7,833 --> 0:31:9,958
But they claim it's going to
redefine the way cities are


537
0:31:9,958 --> 0:31:15,292
designed, built, and powered.


538
0:31:15,292 --> 0:31:19,5
Masdar City in Abu Dhabi, will
be the city of the future, and


539
0:31:19,5 --> 0:31:23,542
the role model for the world.


540
0:31:23,542 --> 0:31:26,375
Once you see what they've
envisioned for this


541
0:31:26,375 --> 0:31:28,208
utopian city,
its very impressive.


542
0:31:28,208 --> 0:31:30,833
It's carbon-neutral, pedestrian
friendly and powered by


543
0:31:30,833 --> 0:31:33,292
renewable energies.


544
0:31:33,292 --> 0:31:35,625
But I do notice, we're
going to have to change our


545
0:31:35,625 --> 0:31:39,5
relationship with cars.


546
0:31:39,5 --> 0:31:45,5
Car audio: Welcome
to Masdar City.


547
0:31:45,5 --> 0:31:49,42
Austin Relton: We are driving in
the bowels of Masdar City in an


548
0:31:49,42 --> 0:31:54,958
electric transportation system.


549
0:31:54,958 --> 0:31:57,458
It's slightly unnerving to see
this for the first time and


550
0:31:57,458 --> 0:32:1,83
"where are we going?"


551
0:32:1,83 --> 0:32:3,375
the first big move the
architects at foster and


552
0:32:3,375 --> 0:32:6,667
partners made was to put all
transportation underneath the


553
0:32:6,667 --> 0:32:11,42
city, leaving the streets
of Masdar totally free


554
0:32:11,42 --> 0:32:13,583
of cars.


555
0:32:13,583 --> 0:32:16,292
The place reminded me
of a medieval city.


556
0:32:16,292 --> 0:32:19,208
And actually, many design
elements are adapted from


557
0:32:19,208 --> 0:32:22,833
ancient Arabic
towns and villages.


558
0:32:22,833 --> 0:32:25,917
It's all about looking back
into history to move forward.


559
0:32:25,917 --> 0:32:27,667
There are some very


560
0:32:27,667 --> 0:32:30,5
very simple ideas
that have a huge impact.


561
0:32:30,5 --> 0:32:33,0
This is a pedestrian zone,
there's no cars here.


562
0:32:33,0 --> 0:32:35,875
This has enabled us to push
our streets together to take


563
0:32:35,875 --> 0:32:41,5
advantage of the shade, channel
the cooling breezes through.


564
0:32:41,5 --> 0:32:44,542
The whole scale here is based on
the human being, its not based


565
0:32:44,542 --> 0:32:47,417
on the motor car.


566
0:32:47,417 --> 0:32:50,0
As soon as you lift up the
pedestrian plane by seven


567
0:32:50,0 --> 0:32:56,0
meters, you've suddenly
captured this breeze.


568
0:32:56,0 --> 0:32:58,25
What you can see here on
the balcony is we've got a


569
0:32:58,25 --> 0:33:2,5
modern interpretation of
an ancient Arabic screen.


570
0:33:2,5 --> 0:33:4,417
What we must avoid is


571
0:33:4,417 --> 0:33:7,792
direct sunlight hitting
any piece of glass.


572
0:33:7,792 --> 0:33:9,583
As soon as the
sun hits the glass,


573
0:33:9,583 --> 0:33:12,25
the heat's transferred into the
building and we have to use more


574
0:33:12,25 --> 0:33:14,625
energy to cool it down.


575
0:33:14,625 --> 0:33:16,125
Can this really make all
that much of a difference?


576
0:33:16,125 --> 0:33:18,125
Yeah, absolutely.


577
0:33:18,125 --> 0:33:20,625
For example, downtown Abu
Dhabi... sixty-meter wide


578
0:33:20,625 --> 0:33:26,0
streets, black asphalt, mirrored
reflective buildings, no relief


579
0:33:26,0 --> 0:33:28,875
from the sun.


580
0:33:28,875 --> 0:33:32,5
On a day in September, the
air temperature in both places


581
0:33:32,5 --> 0:33:35,417
was 39 degrees.


582
0:33:35,417 --> 0:33:37,583
in Abu Dhabi, the


583
0:33:37,583 --> 0:33:43,375
temperature measured
at the asphalt was 57 degrees.


584
0:33:43,375 --> 0:33:47,42
in Masdar, the
temperature measured on the


585
0:33:47,42 --> 0:33:50,875
ground, 33 degrees,
so we've actually lowered


586
0:33:50,875 --> 0:33:53,125
the air temperature.


587
0:33:53,125 --> 0:33:55,458
We're trying to do as much as
possible, with as little as


588
0:33:55,458 --> 0:33:57,458
possible.


589
0:33:57,458 --> 0:34:2,583
These simple design moves, cut
air conditioning needs by 60%.


590
0:34:2,583 --> 0:34:6,75
But this place is also,
technically, very sophisticated.


591
0:34:6,75 --> 0:34:8,167
The roof panels
not only provide


592
0:34:8,167 --> 0:34:11,75
shade, they also
generate electricity.


593
0:34:11,75 --> 0:34:13,625
And the walls
themselves are made of


594
0:34:13,625 --> 0:34:16,833
glass reinforced concrete,
literally sand taken from the


595
0:34:16,833 --> 0:34:19,208
desert.


596
0:34:19,208 --> 0:34:21,75
Everything here is geared
towards maximizing energy


597
0:34:21,75 --> 0:34:24,292
efficiency.


598
0:34:24,292 --> 0:34:29,125
Masdar does represent a
whole different value system.


599
0:34:29,125 --> 0:34:34,125
It represents an
acknowledgment that, eventually,


600
0:34:34,125 --> 0:34:36,875
everybody has to go in a
different kind of direction.


601
0:34:36,875 --> 0:34:38,75
No matter how much
money they have,


602
0:34:38,75 --> 0:34:42,792
no matter how much oil they
have, no matter anything else.


603
0:34:42,792 --> 0:34:45,458
All of the cities here
in this part of the world


604
0:34:45,458 --> 0:34:48,83
have come out of nowhere.


605
0:34:48,83 --> 0:34:51,42
There was nothing here
not so long ago, except


606
0:34:51,42 --> 0:34:54,83
small settlements in the desert.


607
0:34:54,83 --> 0:34:57,0
And then all of this oil
and all of this money,


608
0:34:57,0 --> 0:35:2,667
and suddenly, you know, wham,
these cities started popping up.


609
0:35:2,667 --> 0:35:5,542
But they sprung up
in a false love of a


610
0:35:5,542 --> 0:35:10,375
Western model that was
already out of date.


611
0:35:10,375 --> 0:35:14,42
The model of the late 20th
century automobile-based


612
0:35:14,42 --> 0:35:28,708
energy-hogging city.


613
0:35:28,708 --> 0:35:35,42
For most of the world, energy is
very expensive. But the United


614
0:35:35,42 --> 0:35:37,875
Arab Emirates is sitting
on 10% of the world's


615
0:35:37,875 --> 0:35:44,167
oil, and energy is cheap,
so cheap you can


616
0:35:44,167 --> 0:35:48,5
run a ski slope in
a shopping mall,


617
0:35:48,5 --> 0:35:53,375
and build the world's
tallest skyscraper.


618
0:35:53,375 --> 0:35:56,375
But even here, cheap energy
won't last forever, and the


619
0:35:56,375 --> 0:36:13,625
people behind Masdar are
determined to find alternatives.


620
0:36:13,625 --> 0:36:15,917
Martin Haigh: One of the most
crucial aspects of our energy


621
0:36:15,917 --> 0:36:18,25
odeling and scenario
quantification is how much


622
0:36:18,25 --> 0:36:27,958
energy in total is the
world going to use in 2050.


623
0:36:27,958 --> 0:36:30,417
Wim Thomas: The scenarios team
is a bunch of people with rich


624
0:36:30,417 --> 0:36:31,958
imagination, I would say.


625
0:36:31,958 --> 0:36:33,417
Adam Newton: We have political


626
0:36:33,417 --> 0:36:36,167
scientists, economists,
geopolitical experts.


627
0:36:36,167 --> 0:36:38,458
Really we try to simplify
the complexity all


628
0:36:38,458 --> 0:36:40,333
around us.


629
0:36:40,333 --> 0:36:42,167
Jeremy Bentham: We in the
Scenarios team are currently


630
0:36:42,167 --> 0:36:51,167
putting a lot of attention into
cities and city development.


631
0:36:51,167 --> 0:36:55,0
A lot of megacities are going to
be built in the coming decades.


632
0:36:55,0 --> 0:36:58,208
We're talking about the
equivalent of a new city of a


633
0:36:58,208 --> 0:37:1,458
million people every week.


634
0:37:1,458 --> 0:37:3,917
That is an incredible demand.


635
0:37:3,917 --> 0:37:8,583
Most of the world's resources
are consumed by the cities.


636
0:37:8,583 --> 0:37:10,917
What if we could offer a
blueprint for a better


637
0:37:10,917 --> 0:37:15,125
city? Public transportation,
information, energy.


638
0:37:15,125 --> 0:37:17,792
We understand demand will
rise, we understand the


639
0:37:17,792 --> 0:37:20,75
current supplies will
struggle to keep pace.


640
0:37:20,75 --> 0:37:22,5
So we have to of course, find


641
0:37:22,5 --> 0:37:26,958
ways of bridging the gap between
the demand and the supply.


642
0:37:26,958 --> 0:37:31,458
Decisions that we take now are
going to have a major impact on


643
0:37:31,458 --> 0:37:41,875
decades to come.


644
0:37:41,875 --> 0:37:46,417
There's enough oil under
these sands to last 150 years.


645
0:37:46,417 --> 0:37:49,417
But fundamental to the
Masdar ideal, is getting


646
0:37:49,417 --> 0:37:51,708
energy from renewable
sources, from


647
0:37:51,708 --> 0:37:56,42
geothermal and wind, and most of
all, from a source they have in


648
0:37:56,42 --> 0:38:5,333
abundance in the
desert: the sun.


649
0:38:5,333 --> 0:38:8,25
This field of solar panels
makes more than enough


650
0:38:8,25 --> 0:38:11,667
electricity to run Masdar, and
the excess power is sent to the


651
0:38:11,667 --> 0:38:16,708
Abu Dhabi grid.


652
0:38:16,708 --> 0:38:18,958
But silicon panels are
expensive, and the price of


653
0:38:18,958 --> 0:38:21,208
solar power needs to drop if


654
0:38:21,208 --> 0:38:32,917
its going to be competitive
from Africa to Asia to Arizona.


655
0:38:32,917 --> 0:38:36,75
in the future, Masdar hopes to
get energy from this prototype


656
0:38:36,75 --> 0:38:41,125
called the solar beam down.


657
0:38:41,125 --> 0:38:44,42
Uusing highly reflective
mirrors, the solar beam down may


658
0:38:44,42 --> 0:38:47,292
generate power more cheaply and
ecologically than silicon


659
0:38:47,292 --> 0:38:54,5
panels.


660
0:38:54,5 --> 0:39:0,625
The mirrors bounce the suns rays
up to the tower, and then down


661
0:39:0,625 --> 0:39:5,667
to a point. reaching a
temperature of 600


662
0:39:5,667 --> 0:39:8,917
degrees, steam can
be generated to run


663
0:39:8,917 --> 0:39:13,875
turbines to make electricity.


664
0:39:13,875 --> 0:39:16,708
There's just one problem:
neither of these solar


665
0:39:16,708 --> 0:39:19,25
technologies work at night.


666
0:39:19,25 --> 0:39:21,792
So Masdar needs to
draw power from the grid


667
0:39:21,792 --> 0:39:28,5
when the sun goes down, and that
power comes from natural gas.


668
0:39:28,5 --> 0:39:31,917
The reality is, itâ€™s just not
yet possible to power Masdar


669
0:39:31,917 --> 0:39:39,583
entirely without fossil fuels.


670
0:39:39,583 --> 0:39:42,25
The great challenge with Masdar,


671
0:39:42,25 --> 0:39:45,708
will be "how do you make
it a place that will


672
0:39:45,708 --> 0:39:50,708
not be just this ideal city that
no other place could actually


673
0:39:50,708 --> 0:39:56,958
aspire to, 'cause it
doesn't seem real."


674
0:39:56,958 --> 0:40:2,83
What Masdar has to be is a
laboratory that develops things


675
0:40:2,83 --> 0:40:5,458
that then can be applied in
existing cities all around the


676
0:40:5,458 --> 0:40:9,917
world, because that's
where it will pay off.


677
0:40:9,917 --> 0:40:13,667
There's no pay off if
it's just about itself.


678
0:40:13,667 --> 0:40:17,542
The payoff is "how can
everything it's trying to


679
0:40:17,542 --> 0:40:23,5
do matter in the
rest of the world?"


680
0:40:23,5 --> 0:40:27,42
Right now, there's only a store,
two restaurants, a bank, and a


681
0:40:27,42 --> 0:40:30,167
few hundred students
living here.


682
0:40:30,167 --> 0:40:33,83
It's too early to tell if Masdar
will work as a city when it's


683
0:40:33,83 --> 0:40:36,625
finished, but much has
been achieved: they are


684
0:40:36,625 --> 0:40:38,833
carbon-neutral, and largely,


685
0:40:38,833 --> 0:40:41,42
powered by renewable energies.


686
0:40:41,42 --> 0:40:42,875
Solutions here won't
work everywhere


687
0:40:42,875 --> 0:40:46,0
though, many cities are in cold
climates, and cooling is not


688
0:40:46,0 --> 0:40:48,333
their energy problem.


689
0:40:48,333 --> 0:40:52,167
They need to let sunlight
in, not keep it out.


690
0:40:52,167 --> 0:40:56,917
Cities like Los Angeles or
Houston are built around cars.


691
0:40:56,917 --> 0:41:0,83
Can Masdar's lessons
be applied to them?


692
0:41:0,83 --> 0:41:2,75
Still, its a step
in the right direction.


693
0:41:2,75 --> 0:41:4,667
And, its impressive
that this step is being


694
0:41:4,667 --> 0:41:9,75
taken by a country that
doesn't need to take it.


695
0:41:9,75 --> 0:41:13,583
I met a guy who said "actually,
they did need to take it."


696
0:41:13,583 --> 0:41:19,75
He took me to the
desert to explain.


697
0:41:19,75 --> 0:41:21,333
Muhamad Alkhalil: God says...


698
0:41:21,333 --> 0:41:25,167
[arabic]


699
0:41:25,167 --> 0:41:29,5
God talks about man's
place in, in the universe.


700
0:41:29,5 --> 0:41:32,333
That this world is a trust.


701
0:41:32,333 --> 0:41:35,875
And god offered this
trust to the mountains, to the


702
0:41:35,875 --> 0:41:42,292
heavens, to the land, to earth,
and all refused it, refused to


703
0:41:42,292 --> 0:41:45,42
take this trust.


704
0:41:45,42 --> 0:41:51,833
But man being adventurous, vain,
maybe too ambitious, being man


705
0:41:51,833 --> 0:41:53,708
accepted it.


706
0:41:53,708 --> 0:42:4,292
Now, accepting it,
there is a responsibility.


707
0:42:4,292 --> 0:42:9,625
Taking responsibility
isn't always easy.


708
0:42:9,625 --> 0:42:12,875
Utopia may be
unattainable, but we


709
0:42:12,875 --> 0:42:18,833
must reach for it, and Masdar
does give us a clue to what


710
0:42:18,833 --> 0:42:23,208
cities will be
like in the future.


711
0:42:23,208 --> 0:42:26,83
They may not look
quite like Masdar,


712
0:42:26,83 --> 0:42:29,208
but they will be shaped
by the same concerns.


713
0:42:29,208 --> 0:42:30,917
By energy.


714
0:42:30,917 --> 0:42:35,958
Where it comes
from, and how its used.


715
0:42:35,958 --> 0:42:41,42
The way we've been building
cities lately is unsustainable.


716
0:42:41,42 --> 0:42:44,792
We can't go on
building them that way.


717
0:42:44,792 --> 0:42:48,0
But to say that we can't
build cities the way we have


718
0:42:48,0 --> 0:42:50,458
been building them doesn't mean


719
0:42:50,458 --> 0:42:53,208
we can't build
cities in the future.


720
0:42:53,208 --> 0:42:54,958
In fact, we have
to build cities.


721
0:42:54,958 --> 0:43:0,125
Cities are the essential
statement of human civilization.


722
0:43:0,125 --> 0:43:5,83
So, we will continue to make
them, but we have to make them


723
0:43:5,83 --> 0:43:13,42
in a different way.


724
0:43:13,42 --> 0:43:15,625
what we've seen is that the
world of 2050 won't look


725
0:43:15,625 --> 0:43:18,0
drastically different from
the world today, but the


726
0:43:18,0 --> 0:43:20,208
challenges of a
growing population and


727
0:43:20,208 --> 0:43:23,5
increased energy use
demand real solutions.


728
0:43:23,5 --> 0:43:26,708
Its innovations like those we've
just seen that will be critical


729
0:43:26,708 --> 0:45:26,708
in charting our path
to the world of 2050.
