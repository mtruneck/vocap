###73 >> BOSS: Your hard drive is filthy.
###75 Right - we got your computer back. I mean, it is - it is -
###79 dirty. I'm talking like ho's, sluts, anal, double anal, penetration, interracial facial, creampie -
###85 I don't even know what that is.
###102 >> ANNA DAVID: So we'll start first with the experts.
###106 What are some of the symptoms of sex addiction?
###109 >> ALEXANDRA KATEHAKIS: Well the signs and the symptoms and the consequences are all the same -
###113 the ones we saw there - high levels of preoccupation are what people report. I mean, this is
###117 what takes up most of the time. It's not the orgasm.
###120 It's the thinking about, it's the ritualization,
###122 it's the preparation, it's the obsession.
###125 Loss of time, loss of
###126 friends.
###127 Loss of socialization.
###130 It's a disease of isolation
###133 whereby people spend all of their time,
###135 energy,
###136 either thinking about it, preparing for the next sexual episode
###139 and as I said earlier they continue
###141 despite negative consequences,
###142 which we see in him.
###144 Even when he's confronted, he just looks dead and dissociated,
###148 which is a large part of people that are true sex addicts. There's a high level
###153 of compartmentalization
###155 and dissociation, so that relationships fall away, anything that has any meaning
###159 to people, they start to jeopardize.
###162 And they can't NOT do it, as i think what
###165 Carmen was saying also - that it led her to thinking about killing herself.
###169 >> ANNA: And the thing you said before about how he looks like he's in pain -
###174 >> ALEX: Yeah. Yeah, I mean that's what was so disturbing to me when I saw this movie
###177 and why I liked the movie so much is that they didn't glamorize that at all.
###181 >> ETHLIE ANN VARE: I call that his "Are we having fun yet?" face.
###185 >> ALEX: Yeah, exactly. And you see
###186 the tolerance that builds too. And there's a big argument academically about
###190 whether
###191 there is, in fact, tolerance with this problem.
###194 And yet he keeps upping the ante where he ends up having sex with men
###198 and we don't know that he's oriented towards men in the beginning of the movie but it doesn't
###202 matter. He's just got to get out of this abject pain that he's in.
###206 >> ETHLIE: I think part of that in this instance is his spiral toward self-destruction,
###211 his version of his sister's wrist slashing. So it may not even be
###217 an escalation of a sexual need. I sometimes liken sex addiction to
###221 nicotine addiction. No one is going to debate whether or not nicotine
###226 cigarettes are addictive - an addiction rather than a habit.
###231 But I personally managed to smoke a pack and a half a day for nineteen years. I was addicted. It didn't escalate to four packs a day, I was
###239 still addicted. So I think it's possible to have an addiction without the phenomenon of increasing tolerance.
###245 >> CHRIS DONAGHUE: Yeah. And I always think it's about their subjective experience. And that's why I think it's good that they
###249 showed the biological deterioration.
###251 You know, the neurology completely over-stimulated, the stress response
###254 in the body, he's breaking down, he's not functioning.
###257 I guess - you said high bar, low bar - I put it on a continuum. So I would see him as the
###261 far end meeting all the criteria. Because it's important that they meet multiple criteria,
###266 'cause if you take those apart - each one of those is a component of just being a sexual
###269 person in the world.
###270 Preoccupation - we think about sex a lot,
###272 unmanageability - that will happen from time to time.
###274 So I think you have to always look for multiple criteria.
###277 I think we're a little too over diagnose - over diagnostic culturally. I work with a lot of
###281 couples where
###282 one partner like sex a lot so they're a 'sex addict', they like looking at pornography
###286 so they're a 'sex addict'. The pornography they're looking at is a little dirty - I think that's great - but they
###289 call them a 'sex addict'.
###292 >> ALEX: Right, but I think that's the problem with using the term sex addiction and how it's getting overused now.
###296 Somebody has an affair and they're a 'sex addict' - and that's not true. That's just not true at all. But I
###300 think you're right, and I think
###302 it is a compendium of all
###304 these problems
###306 in one package
###307 where the person just cannot function anymore.
###310 And that's when it's not sexy, it's not funny, it's really
###313 really painful.
###314 >> CHRIS: Yes, because if you want to look at dirty, filthy porn and bang five people in a day in an
###317 alley, and it's functional and it works for you - congratulations. You have my support.
###321 Sounds like a great life but
###323 if it's deteriorating your body, it's impacting your relationships, you're not getting through the work day -
###327 >> ETHLIE: If it's  marked by craving, compulsion and withdrawal, which are
###332 you know, the physiological hallmarks of
###335 addiction as opposed to just the 'bad habit'.
###338 >> ANNA: I think that's a good time to ask the addicts here - is that something
###344 - in terms of escalation, in terms of all three components - is that something
###349 that happened with each of you?
###353 >> CARMEN: Yes. Carmen, sex and love addict.
###357 Yes, absolutely. Without a doubt.
###360 The craving was intolerable.
###365 And the withdrawal
###367 was intolerable.
###372 But if you can get into recovery, you can get through it.
###376 And for me, getting into a 12-Step program
###379 was the thing that got me through it.
###383 It's been the only thing that's really
###385 got me through it.
###388 >> BUD: I'm Bud,
###390 sexually compulsive. If you've noticed - he couldn't have sex with someone
###395 he cared about.
###396 Marianne, the
###397 woman that he worked with.
###399 When he got close to her
###401 he couldn't
###402 perform sexually.
###405 He could have sex with people he didn't love, but he couldn't
###408 have sex with people he loved. And that's
###412 a sign. He used sex as a substitute for his close social and personal relationships.
###418 And he threw sex at
###420 his problems. So, for example, when he had his climactic bad night
###428 with his sister,
###430 he went out and he just tried to prove that he could have sex. I think even
###434 sex with Marianne was to
###437 retaliate to David, his boss,
###440 for having trouble at work. That he would conquer his
###446 employee.
###447 So he threw sex at all of his problems. And it still didn't work.
###452 >> MILES: Miles,
###453 sex addict. I -
###455 touching on that,
###456 one thing that
###459 - that i believe is that sex addiction is an intimacy disorder.
###463 And -
###465 that's a huge component of it, at least for me and my experience with
###469 other people I've worked with.
###473 And what Bud was talking about -
###475 it was perfectly
###477 illustrated by
###480 - that in terms of his inability to function
###485 sexually with someone he did care about and his inability to have any
###489 relationships period. You know, he said the longest relationship he'd ever had was just four
###493 months, and a number of other things, and
###496 sex addicts tend to
###500 - it's a very
###503 - it's a very selfish disease and what you're doing is you're using - rather than having
###507 a sensual
###508 or spiritual connection to another person, it's a completely
###513 physical
###515 endeavor
###517 - that there's - it's - it's
###521 - When I got sexually sober, I realized that what i was doing
###525 when I was having sex with other people - was I was actually just using another
###528 person for masturbation. I wasn't actually having a connection to them.
###532 And that was kind of, you know, what my sex life was like. I also like that they
###536 showed in the movie - his relationship with pornography - and that was a very big
###542 addiction for myself.
###544 And I see - and I'm seeing more and more people - especially with - it's so easily
###549 accessible right now
###551 - I can't even open up my email, you know, without having
###554 twenty
###555 invites to porn sites.
###558 >> ANNA: Well something for the therapists - how do you know
###562 if someone - if a client is a sex addict?
###565 >> CHRIS: Part of it has to have a subjective component.
###569 Because I think it's easy to get into
###571 this normalizing view of how things should be, how sex should be, how relationships should be,
###576 such a multitude of configurations.
###578 The one addict mentioned
###580 having sex with the person as though they're not a real person.
###583 If that's the only
###583 way you can be sexual, it's probably problematic. I try to work with people having a
###587 full skill set
###588 where sometimes if you want objectified sex where it's all about you - that's great,
###592 but you want to have the ability to tap into intimate sex as well.
###595 So I think the first piece is subjectively recognizing that this is
###598 not feeling good anymore, it's not working for me - and take it from there.
###601 >. ETHLIE: I like to - I try to do little, like actual signs as opposed to symptoms -
###605 one being objective and the other being subjective - like if you've turned your
###609 monitor on your desk so that no one else can see what's on it - Sign.
###613 Right? If you're keeping a list or a diary of sexual conquests but lying to other people
###618 about your sexual conquests - Sign.
###621 If your number of sexual conquests is approaching four figures -
###625 Sign.
###627 >> CHRIS: Wait, I don't think -
###630 >> ETHLIE: If you know the number - Sign.
###631 >> CHRIS: I just want to make sure -
###631 >> ETHLIE: I said sign, didn't say diagnosis. I said sign.
###635 You know, you stack up enough of them–∏
###638 If you're keeping trophies - Sign. If you have a certain ritualized pattern, do your sex partners
###645 have to dress a certain way or look a certain way for you - Sign. Not diagnosis. Sign.
###652 >> ALEX: THis is why Ethlie's book "Love Addict"
###656 is so hilarious and well-written
###658 if you're interested in reading more about love addiction. I would say that what we do at the Center for
###661 Healthy Sex is that we use tests. One of them is a test for hyper-sexual
###665 behavior that has solid psychometrics. And that when people fall within these ranges
###670 they most likely have a problem. People typically call our office because
###674 they're identifying as having a problem.
###676 They're saying "What I'm doing is not okay for me."
###679 And there are a couple of self tests that you can find on the internet if you
###683 google "sex addiction screening test"
###685 that will give people an idea about where they are on the road map.
###689 And I'm in agreement with Chris - if somebody says "I have a problem with this"
###693 then we have a problem.
###694 If they don't have a problem, it's not a problem.
###698 >> ANNA: So it's sort of the equivalent of the twenty questions for addiction?
###704 >> ALEX: Sure. Or CAGE which is maybe, what? Four questions.
###708 >> ANNA: Right. Does anyone have anything else to add on this?
###712 >> MILES: I was going to say -
###713 Miles, sex addict - I was going to say one thing about
###717 a point I wanted to make
###720 at least for myself, and I found this with, you know, with a lot of the addicts I know -
###724 Sex addiction, indeed we get into the ritualization and talking about
###729 how it's more - it's more about
###731 you know, the hours preparing and searching rather than
###737 the actual orgasm
###738 - I know it's about -
###742 addicts tend to use this as a way to manage our
###746 feelings. You know, this is a coping mechanism that we have learned to do
###750 with our feelings the same way an alcoholic drinks
###754 perhaps to manage their feelings. Sex addicts have learned that - you know, there's a reward
###759 center in my brain that I can activate and it'll make, you know, my fears and - and
###763 and uh...
###764 and bad feelings not be so present if I engage in this behavior.
###771 >> ANNA: We're going to show the third clip
###773 and that is - "What are the signs of love addiction?"
