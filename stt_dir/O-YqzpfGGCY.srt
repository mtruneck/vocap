CHRISANN BRENNAN:
I just wrote this.


4
0:0:5,82 --> 0:0:7,19
It wasn't a part of my talk.


5
0:0:7,19 --> 0:0:9,56
And I want to say that
I know a lot of people


6
0:0:9,56 --> 0:0:12,885
have profound feelings
about Steve Jobs.


7
0:0:12,885 --> 0:0:16,44
He was a gem and a rare one.


8
0:0:16,44 --> 0:0:20,51
And I want to ask
you to please only


9
0:0:20,51 --> 0:0:26,24
take what's of value of my
talk today and let the rest go.


10
0:0:26,24 --> 0:0:28,41
This is such a new world to me.


11
0:0:28,41 --> 0:0:30,95
So many people have
so many thoughts.


12
0:0:30,95 --> 0:0:33,95



13
0:0:33,95 --> 0:0:36,65
There's so many angles
of perception on him.


14
0:0:36,65 --> 0:0:39,86
But today, I'm simply
talking about my perceptions.


15
0:0:39,86 --> 0:0:47,167
And I hope you'll feel it's a
valuable contribution in total.


16
0:0:47,167 --> 0:0:48,75
I also want to say
that I don't really


17
0:0:48,75 --> 0:0:51,35
know the technical world
that you guys live in.


18
0:0:51,35 --> 0:0:54,67
I don't know what he created.


19
0:0:54,67 --> 0:0:57,48
So this is a new
experience for me.


20
0:0:57,48 --> 0:1:2,73



21
0:1:2,73 --> 0:1:7,66
And please forgive me for my
naivete at certain points.


22
0:1:7,66 --> 0:1:8,26
So I'll begin.


23
0:1:8,26 --> 0:1:11,4



24
0:1:11,4 --> 0:1:15,2
Today, I wanted to talk about
creativity and initiative,


25
0:1:15,2 --> 0:1:20,41
first mine in writing my book
and then Steve's in creativity


26
0:1:20,41 --> 0:1:22,6
as I perceived it.


27
0:1:22,6 --> 0:1:25,43
And thirdly, about
Creativity, with a capital C,


28
0:1:25,43 --> 0:1:27,16
into the future.


29
0:1:27,16 --> 0:1:31,17
Because whether we're talking
about children, new technology,


30
0:1:31,17 --> 0:1:36,44
the arts, companies,
countries, or the whole world,


31
0:1:36,44 --> 0:1:42,98
now more than ever we need to be
more conscious in our creating.


32
0:1:42,98 --> 0:1:44,91
We're all so
creative that I think


33
0:1:44,91 --> 0:1:48,54
we need a metalevel of
considerations, councils


34
0:1:48,54 --> 0:1:50,945
even, to figure out
where we're going


35
0:1:50,945 --> 0:1:55,4
and what we want
our outcomes to be.


36
0:1:55,4 --> 0:1:59,665
Here I am at Google, and you
have the unofficial byline


37
0:1:59,665 --> 0:2:1,73
of "don't be evil."


38
0:2:1,73 --> 0:2:5,8
And this is what I'm talking
about, except more of it,


39
0:2:5,8 --> 0:2:8,26
a long list of
ethical considerations


40
0:2:8,26 --> 0:2:11,43
that people can cross-check
because everything


41
0:2:11,43 --> 0:2:12,77
is affected by our creating.


42
0:2:12,77 --> 0:2:17,83



43
0:2:17,83 --> 0:2:23,82
Before I start
diving into my story,


44
0:2:23,82 --> 0:2:26,66
I want you to know that I'm
predominantly right brained.


45
0:2:26,66 --> 0:2:29,39
I wrote this book
cinemagraphically


46
0:2:29,39 --> 0:2:32,4
because I'm first and
foremost an artist.


47
0:2:32,4 --> 0:2:35,85
And the practices of filming
help me bridge my experience


48
0:2:35,85 --> 0:2:39,19
as a painter into writing.


49
0:2:39,19 --> 0:2:42,49
I think in a combination of
images, symbols, metaphors,


50
0:2:42,49 --> 0:2:43,68
and words.


51
0:2:43,68 --> 0:2:45,68
In fact, I don't
even think there's


52
0:2:45,68 --> 0:2:49,98
a big difference between
symbols, images, metaphors,


53
0:2:49,98 --> 0:2:55,93
and words because they're
as much an energetic fact


54
0:2:55,93 --> 0:2:58,5
as this podium is for me.


55
0:2:58,5 --> 0:3:1,15
Mainly, I think in
terms of energetics.


56
0:3:1,15 --> 0:3:4,292
And I see energy and I
have found visualization


57
0:3:4,292 --> 0:3:5,625
to be a force for actualisation.


58
0:3:5,625 --> 0:3:13,95



59
0:3:13,95 --> 0:3:16,47
This is one of my
most recent paintings.


60
0:3:16,47 --> 0:3:17,63
It was commissioned.


61
0:3:17,63 --> 0:3:23,39
And yet when I paint for someone
else, I also paint for myself.


62
0:3:23,39 --> 0:3:25,65
The painting lay the
ground for my book.


63
0:3:25,65 --> 0:3:30,4
This was my version
of an outline.


64
0:3:30,4 --> 0:3:31,88
I didn't know what
it fully meant


65
0:3:31,88 --> 0:3:33,76
until I was well
into the writing.


66
0:3:33,76 --> 0:3:37,35
In fact, I'm still
discovering what it means.


67
0:3:37,35 --> 0:3:41,58
I think the future is about
left and right brain integration


68
0:3:41,58 --> 0:3:42,65
too.


69
0:3:42,65 --> 0:3:47,4
Its the evolutionary next
step for people everywhere.


70
0:3:47,4 --> 0:3:51,2
And it's, of course,
already started.


71
0:3:51,2 --> 0:3:53,93
If I have time, which
I don't think I will,


72
0:3:53,93 --> 0:3:56,87
I'll do a quick
decode on the painting


73
0:3:56,87 --> 0:3:59,29
at the end of the talk.


74
0:3:59,29 --> 0:4:2,63
And if I don't, I'll post
the image and a decode


75
0:4:2,63 --> 0:4:6,63
on my book's website,
thebiteintheapple.com,


76
0:4:6,63 --> 0:4:7,59
by the end of February.


77
0:4:7,59 --> 0:4:12,69



78
0:4:12,69 --> 0:4:15,96
So there were
three things that I


79
0:4:15,96 --> 0:4:18,959
decided I would never
do in this life.


80
0:4:18,959 --> 0:4:22,87
I had enough self-knowledge
by the time I was 35 years old


81
0:4:22,87 --> 0:4:25,93
to know what I wasn't
interested or good at.


82
0:4:25,93 --> 0:4:28,17
One was study of history.


83
0:4:28,17 --> 0:4:30,99
I'd gotten crippling
migraines, at least


84
0:4:30,99 --> 0:4:34,81
once a week, in my US history
classes when I was young.


85
0:4:34,81 --> 0:4:40,28
I wasn't interested in so much
focus on men's wars, politics,


86
0:4:40,28 --> 0:4:41,92
and treaties.


87
0:4:41,92 --> 0:4:44,55
Number two is that I
would never play the drums


88
0:4:44,55 --> 0:4:49,38
because my sense of rhythm
was so reliably wonky.


89
0:4:49,38 --> 0:4:52,54
Number three is that
I'd never write a book,


90
0:4:52,54 --> 0:4:54,86
since writing was
not my strength


91
0:4:54,86 --> 0:4:58,45
and because I knew it was
way too much information


92
0:4:58,45 --> 0:5:2,55
to organize and
be accountable to.


93
0:5:2,55 --> 0:5:5,96
Yet here I've written a
book, and it's own history,


94
0:5:5,96 --> 0:5:9,25
and it was in part due to
the rhythms in the language


95
0:5:9,25 --> 0:5:11,7
that I became interested
in the craft of writing


96
0:5:11,7 --> 0:5:14,99
for its own sake.


97
0:5:14,99 --> 0:5:17,42
I'd written a couple of
good papers in art college.


98
0:5:17,42 --> 0:5:19,26
But prior to writing
this book, that


99
0:5:19,26 --> 0:5:24,47
was my only experience of
real concentrated writing.


100
0:5:24,47 --> 0:5:27,16
Writing is traumatic
and stressful for me.


101
0:5:27,16 --> 0:5:29,92
I love the ideas, but
they seem to bottleneck


102
0:5:29,92 --> 0:5:32,92
if I have to sequence
them on a page.


103
0:5:32,92 --> 0:5:36,77
Yet I decided I had to
write this book myself


104
0:5:36,77 --> 0:5:39,38
because the process
of writing was


105
0:5:39,38 --> 0:5:44,96
the only way I could drop
down into a depth of memory


106
0:5:44,96 --> 0:5:46,92
and manage my own message.


107
0:5:46,92 --> 0:5:49,29
I started in 2006.


108
0:5:49,29 --> 0:5:54,25
And it took me over six years
of full-time work to complete.


109
0:5:54,25 --> 0:5:58,83
Now I tell myself pay attention
to what I would never do,


110
0:5:58,83 --> 0:6:1,15
because writing
this book has been


111
0:6:1,15 --> 0:6:4,53
one of the most important
things I've ever done.


112
0:6:4,53 --> 0:6:7,8
I also want to emphasize that
if I can write this book,


113
0:6:7,8 --> 0:6:12,12
I'm really sure almost
anybody can do anything.


114
0:6:12,12 --> 0:6:16,34
Over the years, a few people
had suggested I write my story.


115
0:6:16,34 --> 0:6:20,51
Yet many more
warned me off of it,


116
0:6:20,51 --> 0:6:23,2
even going so far to suggest
that I didn't have the right


117
0:6:23,2 --> 0:6:26,29
to speak about my
life or my history


118
0:6:26,29 --> 0:6:27,99
since it involved Steve Jobs.


119
0:6:27,99 --> 0:6:30,705
And I think many people
were assuming the worst


120
0:6:30,705 --> 0:6:34,23
and implying that it
was bad form for a woman


121
0:6:34,23 --> 0:6:37,15
to speak about the
personal life of a man who


122
0:6:37,15 --> 0:6:39,94
was a public figure.


123
0:6:39,94 --> 0:6:43,13
But I did not write
this as a tell-all.


124
0:6:43,13 --> 0:6:46,36
Instead, I felt my story was
important, one, because I knew


125
0:6:46,36 --> 0:6:50,47
Steve before it all happened
and also because we came


126
0:6:50,47 --> 0:6:54,2
of age together
in a certain way.


127
0:6:54,2 --> 0:6:58,23
Two, because I witnessed
firsthand Steve's changes


128
0:6:58,23 --> 0:7:0,41
as Apple began.


129
0:7:0,41 --> 0:7:2,96
And three, because we
co-parented the child


130
0:7:2,96 --> 0:7:4,56
through all the years.


131
0:7:4,56 --> 0:7:7,52
Also four, I have
a universal message


132
0:7:7,52 --> 0:7:12,14
and there's a universal
message in my book.


133
0:7:12,14 --> 0:7:14,26
Steve and I met when we were 17.


134
0:7:14,26 --> 0:7:16,46
And I was his first
love and I'm the mother


135
0:7:16,46 --> 0:7:19,33
of his first child
and my only child.


136
0:7:19,33 --> 0:7:22,28
We knew, loved, and
admired each other.


137
0:7:22,28 --> 0:7:27,67
And when things got difficult
between us as Apple took off,


138
0:7:27,67 --> 0:7:30,35
I witnessed his
incremental changes


139
0:7:30,35 --> 0:7:34,87
from sweet, mystic, poet,
super-bright, goofy guy


140
0:7:34,87 --> 0:7:39,8
into a ruthless, stunningly
successful business tycoon.


141
0:7:39,8 --> 0:7:43,83
In the end, it is precisely
because of my direct experience


142
0:7:43,83 --> 0:7:47,12
with him that I feel I have
important contributions


143
0:7:47,12 --> 0:7:50,6
to make on the body
of knowledge with him.


144
0:7:50,6 --> 0:7:57,99
And the other thing is I
never intended to pull him


145
0:7:57,99 --> 0:7:59,18
from hero status.


146
0:7:59,18 --> 0:8:1,71
I know so many people love him.


147
0:8:1,71 --> 0:8:6,46
And it would've been
a balanced approach.


148
0:8:6,46 --> 0:8:11,8
I was always more interested
in the human side of him.


149
0:8:11,8 --> 0:8:14,3
Did I understand everything
that happened with Steve Jobs?


150
0:8:14,3 --> 0:8:15,1
Absolutely not.


151
0:8:15,1 --> 0:8:17,91
But I still think I
have an unusual vantage


152
0:8:17,91 --> 0:8:20,12
point of some
things that I think


153
0:8:20,12 --> 0:8:25,56
are unique and will be valued,
may be valued, will be valued.


154
0:8:25,56 --> 0:8:30,26
So much seems to hang on
my memory, my integrity,


155
0:8:30,26 --> 0:8:33,8
and my insight.


156
0:8:33,8 --> 0:8:37,919
In 2006, I became sick
and it lasted for years.


157
0:8:37,919 --> 0:8:40,48
I had one of those
undiagnosable illnesses


158
0:8:40,48 --> 0:8:44,79
that probably came from a
combination of exhaustion,


159
0:8:44,79 --> 0:8:47,4
mold in the apartment
I was living in,


160
0:8:47,4 --> 0:8:50,95
and too much exposure
to fumes from painting.


161
0:8:50,95 --> 0:8:53,22
With a compromised
immune system,


162
0:8:53,22 --> 0:8:56,3
I got one terrible
illness after another


163
0:8:56,3 --> 0:9:0,19
and had to spend a lot
of time doing nothing.


164
0:9:0,19 --> 0:9:4,16
Bored and languishing,
I slowed way, way down


165
0:9:4,16 --> 0:9:6,52
and became willing
to consider and then


166
0:9:6,52 --> 0:9:9,63
to decide to write my story.


167
0:9:9,63 --> 0:9:12,41
So with nothing else
to occupy my time


168
0:9:12,41 --> 0:9:15,27
and in the most
tremulous, naive,


169
0:9:15,27 --> 0:9:18,52
childish first
steps that I began


170
0:9:18,52 --> 0:9:22,9
by writing a list of
chapters and some good ideas


171
0:9:22,9 --> 0:9:26,69
in a cafe in
Tiburon, California.


172
0:9:26,69 --> 0:9:29,565
To say I was reluctant
to be public about Steve


173
0:9:29,565 --> 0:9:33,81
and my long history
is an understatement.


174
0:9:33,81 --> 0:9:36,25
It's nuanced and
a difficult story.


175
0:9:36,25 --> 0:9:38,72
And it was hard to sort through.


176
0:9:38,72 --> 0:9:41,4
Also I didn't want
to relive the pain.


177
0:9:41,4 --> 0:9:43,47
Of course, Steve didn't
want me to write it


178
0:9:43,47 --> 0:9:47,43
and this was hard on me too,
mainly because it put pressure


179
0:9:47,43 --> 0:9:50,28
on our daughter, who was going
back and forth between our two


180
0:9:50,28 --> 0:9:51,8
households.


181
0:9:51,8 --> 0:9:54,91
Additionally, for years I
absolutely questioned daily


182
0:9:54,91 --> 0:9:57,15
if I had what it took
to write this book.


183
0:9:57,15 --> 0:9:59,61
And I put it down
a couple of times,


184
0:9:59,61 --> 0:10:3,36
only to return to it with
just greater commitment.


185
0:10:3,36 --> 0:10:5,99
One because the
ideas were so rich,


186
0:10:5,99 --> 0:10:8,95
that they just seem too
important, and also too


187
0:10:8,95 --> 0:10:10,83
interesting to drop.


188
0:10:10,83 --> 0:10:14,77
And two, because there
was this exquisite sense


189
0:10:14,77 --> 0:10:19,61
of the pause in the writing
process that I loved.


190
0:10:19,61 --> 0:10:23,91
The mounting silence of the
years coming up to the tipping


191
0:10:23,91 --> 0:10:30,11
point and then their
remarkable fall into words.


192
0:10:30,11 --> 0:10:32,67
I worked on the first
100 pages for two years,


193
0:10:32,67 --> 0:10:35,18
trying to figure out how
to weave all the complexity


194
0:10:35,18 --> 0:10:36,84
into something readable.


195
0:10:36,84 --> 0:10:39,61
I worked seven days a week,
about two to three hours a day,


196
0:10:39,61 --> 0:10:43,73
which took pretty much
all the energy I had.


197
0:10:43,73 --> 0:10:45,48
When I started to get
physically better,


198
0:10:45,48 --> 0:10:48,31
I committed to five hours
a day, seven days a week.


199
0:10:48,31 --> 0:10:50,97
A huge turning point
came for me three years


200
0:10:50,97 --> 0:10:54,29
into the project when a
colleague took my first 70


201
0:10:54,29 --> 0:10:59,12
pages and turned them into
discrete, coherent chapters.


202
0:10:59,12 --> 0:11:2,23
Once I understood how
to make a chapter,


203
0:11:2,23 --> 0:11:7,0
I completed the next 19 chapters
in the second three years.


204
0:11:7,0 --> 0:11:9,7
My daily experience
was that I would


205
0:11:9,7 --> 0:11:13,28
wake up early every morning
and begin with the inspiration,


206
0:11:13,28 --> 0:11:15,25
working out all kinds of ideas.


207
0:11:15,25 --> 0:11:18,59
And yet no matter what,
by the end of every day


208
0:11:18,59 --> 0:11:22,72
I was purely mortified
by what I had written.


209
0:11:22,72 --> 0:11:26,84
This is a strange
and strained history.


210
0:11:26,84 --> 0:11:29,51
The subject was
over the top and I


211
0:11:29,51 --> 0:11:31,87
was deeply concerned
about how it


212
0:11:31,87 --> 0:11:34,57
would affect our
daughter's life.


213
0:11:34,57 --> 0:11:38,72
Also I felt that
my story is, was


214
0:11:38,72 --> 0:11:40,85
a part of the
collective unconscious


215
0:11:40,85 --> 0:11:44,81
and I feared no one
wanted to hear from me.


216
0:11:44,81 --> 0:11:47,26
Add to this the fact that
I didn't know the writing


217
0:11:47,26 --> 0:11:51,58
conventions for start talking
about such a dicey subject,


218
0:11:51,58 --> 0:11:54,5
the personal and impersonal.


219
0:11:54,5 --> 0:11:56,36
I don't read that much.


220
0:11:56,36 --> 0:11:58,77
I had little experience
in communicating


221
0:11:58,77 --> 0:12:0,96
about such difficulty
in a balanced,


222
0:12:0,96 --> 0:12:3,8
truthful, and intelligent way.


223
0:12:3,8 --> 0:12:6,6
Five years into my project,
I was still fretting


224
0:12:6,6 --> 0:12:10,48
and I told a friend I needed
a Ph.D. to write this book.


225
0:12:10,48 --> 0:12:14,17
And she said, well, Steve didn't
have a Ph.D. to do what he did.


226
0:12:14,17 --> 0:12:15,14
So get over it.


227
0:12:15,14 --> 0:12:17,76
Keep going.


228
0:12:17,76 --> 0:12:20,22
People have assumed
I kept a journal


229
0:12:20,22 --> 0:12:24,77
because the detail in the book
is so clear and descriptive.


230
0:12:24,77 --> 0:12:26,36
But I didn't have a journal.


231
0:12:26,36 --> 0:12:30,28
I'm just extremely
observant and I


232
0:12:30,28 --> 0:12:34,3
seem to track detail
through all my senses.


233
0:12:34,3 --> 0:12:36,75
Plus, this history
had somehow stayed


234
0:12:36,75 --> 0:12:39,9
in something like a
morphic field around me


235
0:12:39,9 --> 0:12:42,29
through the years
because I assume


236
0:12:42,29 --> 0:12:45,55
it was waiting and pressing
on me to understand


237
0:12:45,55 --> 0:12:47,98
what had happened.


238
0:12:47,98 --> 0:12:51,6
As I said, the process of
writing was interesting to me.


239
0:12:51,6 --> 0:12:56,94
And there were times that
things that seemed insignificant


240
0:12:56,94 --> 0:13:0,0
buzzed at me to
explore more deeply.


241
0:13:0,0 --> 0:13:4,81
And when I followed them,
they opened up my awareness


242
0:13:4,81 --> 0:13:8,2
into new connections
and new revelations.


243
0:13:8,2 --> 0:13:10,71
Other times after getting
the best sentences down


244
0:13:10,71 --> 0:13:13,93
I could, I had to double and
triple check for the truth.


245
0:13:13,93 --> 0:13:18,54
In going back and forth between
the descriptions and the truth,


246
0:13:18,54 --> 0:13:20,91
further detail would emerge.


247
0:13:20,91 --> 0:13:26,47
I found I also found that
using word combinations


248
0:13:26,47 --> 0:13:29,305
of opposite meaning
helped me grasp


249
0:13:29,305 --> 0:13:32,73
in language the
startling extremes that


250
0:13:32,73 --> 0:13:36,8
were the hallmarks of Steve's
personality and charisma


251
0:13:36,8 --> 0:13:39,37
after Apple started.


252
0:13:39,37 --> 0:13:42,49
All in all, the craft
of writing itself


253
0:13:42,49 --> 0:13:45,1
distracted me from
the pain, even


254
0:13:45,1 --> 0:13:48,4
as I granulated down into it.


255
0:13:48,4 --> 0:13:51,95



256
0:13:51,95 --> 0:13:55,22
I have a type of dyslexia,
some kind of dyslexia.


257
0:13:55,22 --> 0:13:56,92
And being that
that was the case,


258
0:13:56,92 --> 0:13:59,15
I really could not
have written this book


259
0:13:59,15 --> 0:14:1,56
with a pencil or
even a typewriter.


260
0:14:1,56 --> 0:14:3,45
I don't think sequentially.


261
0:14:3,45 --> 0:14:6,53
Much of the material
was so upsetting.


262
0:14:6,53 --> 0:14:8,95
And yet with a
computer, it was all


263
0:14:8,95 --> 0:14:11,77
made easier, as I was
able to move clusters


264
0:14:11,77 --> 0:14:16,15
of ideas around it big swaths
to work out right connection


265
0:14:16,15 --> 0:14:22,41
points, that opened up
more insight and balance.


266
0:14:22,41 --> 0:14:26,77
The plasticity that the writing
with the computer provided me


267
0:14:26,77 --> 0:14:30,58
was like painting and
it allowed for layering.


268
0:14:30,58 --> 0:14:32,71
And so it made it
possible for me


269
0:14:32,71 --> 0:14:35,19
to handle the many
years, while still


270
0:14:35,19 --> 0:14:38,8
having fun exploring
the intricacies of ideas


271
0:14:38,8 --> 0:14:44,62
I was trying to access,
layer, and get across.


272
0:14:44,62 --> 0:14:46,59
Then after a while,
something unexpected


273
0:14:46,59 --> 0:14:49,6
started happening, which
never would have occurred


274
0:14:49,6 --> 0:14:52,3
if I had been so focused
on getting it right--


275
0:14:52,3 --> 0:14:55,32
if I hadn't been so focused.


276
0:14:55,32 --> 0:14:58,66
As I relived the scenes
in order to write them,


277
0:14:58,66 --> 0:15:1,54
I became more of a
witness to it all


278
0:15:1,54 --> 0:15:3,91
and started picking up
new levels of detail


279
0:15:3,91 --> 0:15:5,31
that I had missed
when I had been


280
0:15:5,31 --> 0:15:7,61
so young, living through it.


281
0:15:7,61 --> 0:15:11,46
Plus the more attention
I brought to the history,


282
0:15:11,46 --> 0:15:14,27
the more I saw and
the more I felt


283
0:15:14,27 --> 0:15:19,33
that I was changing the
history inside myself.


284
0:15:19,33 --> 0:15:22,97
Consciousness
changes everything.


285
0:15:22,97 --> 0:15:27,16
For so long, I had met
Steve's ideas of things


286
0:15:27,16 --> 0:15:30,2
define my reality.


287
0:15:30,2 --> 0:15:36,53
And he had become defensive,
and fast, and intelligent,


288
0:15:36,53 --> 0:15:38,83
and somewhat disconnected
from his heart


289
0:15:38,83 --> 0:15:40,83
as he grew into Apple.


290
0:15:40,83 --> 0:15:46,64
Out of this, he sometimes
projected the worst stuff


291
0:15:46,64 --> 0:15:51,0
on me, faster than I
could process through it.


292
0:15:51,0 --> 0:15:55,7
Yet as I slowed down and
focused on my experience,


293
0:15:55,7 --> 0:16:1,28
I realize that things were not
as he had so deftly chalked


294
0:16:1,28 --> 0:16:3,5
them up to be.


295
0:16:3,5 --> 0:16:7,47
In a certain way, I had been
buried by Steve, the Zen


296
0:16:7,47 --> 0:16:12,39
master, and the Apple-- or
the machine behind Apple.


297
0:16:12,39 --> 0:16:14,73
But when I stepped
back into the history


298
0:16:14,73 --> 0:16:19,265
to quietly tell myself my
story as I experienced it,


299
0:16:19,265 --> 0:16:23,35
the "her" story of it all,
it was like waking up.


300
0:16:23,35 --> 0:16:26,46
Spin is a powerful thing.


301
0:16:26,46 --> 0:16:29,67
Interpretation is
a powerful thing.


302
0:16:29,67 --> 0:16:34,54
But the truth is more powerful
within your own context.


303
0:16:34,54 --> 0:16:37,2
A single voice does
make a difference.


304
0:16:37,2 --> 0:16:39,85
We don't necessarily
hear ourselves


305
0:16:39,85 --> 0:16:41,86
when others won't hear us.


306
0:16:41,86 --> 0:16:45,52
But in writing, I
finally heard myself.


307
0:16:45,52 --> 0:16:47,53
I also discovered
that forgiveness


308
0:16:47,53 --> 0:16:52,47
is a process and a very
long haul, but a worthy one.


309
0:16:52,47 --> 0:16:54,98
A line from an
ancient Hindu text


310
0:16:54,98 --> 0:16:57,43
had replayed in
my mind for years.


311
0:16:57,43 --> 0:17:1,87
It was a basic principle
of creativity, karmic law,


312
0:17:1,87 --> 0:17:2,69
and life.


313
0:17:2,69 --> 0:17:7,72
And it said, one must rise
by that by which one falls.


314
0:17:7,72 --> 0:17:11,14
And here I found that by
doing the work of writing,


315
0:17:11,14 --> 0:17:16,31
I was able to climb up and
out of my tremendous self-loss


316
0:17:16,31 --> 0:17:19,339
into a lighter, truer being.


317
0:17:19,339 --> 0:17:24,99



318
0:17:24,99 --> 0:17:25,784
Throughout the writing,
as a discipline,


319
0:17:25,784 --> 0:17:29,49
I cross-checked some of the
more complicated memories


320
0:17:29,49 --> 0:17:32,82
with people who were also
there at certain points


321
0:17:32,82 --> 0:17:35,71
in the history and
I got confirmations.


322
0:17:35,71 --> 0:17:41,18
They had understood things as I
had, which was a great relief.


323
0:17:41,18 --> 0:17:44,52
This, in addition to 10
years of visionary painting,


324
0:17:44,52 --> 0:17:49,77
the six years of writing, and
I not only recovered my story,


325
0:17:49,77 --> 0:17:53,6
I used the whole experience
to understand the history


326
0:17:53,6 --> 0:17:56,91
through a wisdom and
compassion trajectory.


327
0:17:56,91 --> 0:17:59,38
So that in essence,
the book provided me


328
0:17:59,38 --> 0:18:2,54
the rare opportunity
to review my life


329
0:18:2,54 --> 0:18:4,93
and take time to work
it out and update


330
0:18:4,93 --> 0:18:8,18
it an ethical framework
for my 50-year-old self.


331
0:18:8,18 --> 0:18:11,15



332
0:18:11,15 --> 0:18:16,12
In the second 2/3
of the book, as I


333
0:18:16,12 --> 0:18:19,42
lived how bad things
had been, I found


334
0:18:19,42 --> 0:18:21,66
that I was traversing
what was for me how


335
0:18:21,66 --> 0:18:25,77
realms of such destitute
feelings, that the only way


336
0:18:25,77 --> 0:18:28,67
I remember true loveliness
was the little birds


337
0:18:28,67 --> 0:18:31,5
singing outside my
windows in the morning.


338
0:18:31,5 --> 0:18:33,97
The work was really
dramatic and extreme.


339
0:18:33,97 --> 0:18:37,2
But on the other hand, the
terribleness had an upside.


340
0:18:37,2 --> 0:18:40,62
It enlivened my sense
of determination.


341
0:18:40,62 --> 0:18:43,45
Diving into the
dark and surfacing


342
0:18:43,45 --> 0:18:45,77
is the artistic process.


343
0:18:45,77 --> 0:18:47,83
And I'm no stranger to that.


344
0:18:47,83 --> 0:18:51,57
I just had never done it
in words before and never


345
0:18:51,57 --> 0:18:54,9
on the same subject for so long.


346
0:18:54,9 --> 0:18:57,94
Long story short,
I dug my heels in


347
0:18:57,94 --> 0:19:1,91
and decided I was going
to get my book written


348
0:19:1,91 --> 0:19:3,65
or die doing it.


349
0:19:3,65 --> 0:19:7,23
It was a messy process getting
into the do or die part,


350
0:19:7,23 --> 0:19:11,48
but eventually I realized
that what I was really saying


351
0:19:11,48 --> 0:19:12,31
was the opposite.


352
0:19:12,31 --> 0:19:13,768
I was going to get
the book written


353
0:19:13,768 --> 0:19:16,24
and live more fully
as a result of it.


354
0:19:16,24 --> 0:19:20,36
Some people mistakenly think
I'm obsessed and fascinated


355
0:19:20,36 --> 0:19:21,94
by Steve Jobs.


356
0:19:21,94 --> 0:19:23,96
But this is not accurate.


357
0:19:23,96 --> 0:19:26,95
I was obsessed by
getting at the truth


358
0:19:26,95 --> 0:19:30,53
and fascinated by
my revelations.


359
0:19:30,53 --> 0:19:33,96
It felt wonderful to speak, and
be funny, and open my heart,


360
0:19:33,96 --> 0:19:36,0
and tell the truth.


361
0:19:36,0 --> 0:19:38,98
It felt to me like I was
driving a little car over hill


362
0:19:38,98 --> 0:19:41,18
and dale, looking
out the windows


363
0:19:41,18 --> 0:19:43,41
and reflecting on the views.


364
0:19:43,41 --> 0:19:46,25
I wanted to know why he
had been so cruel after we


365
0:19:46,25 --> 0:19:48,93
had been so deeply in love.


366
0:19:48,93 --> 0:19:50,93
I just kept staying
with the question


367
0:19:50,93 --> 0:19:53,27
until I got the bigger answers.


368
0:19:53,27 --> 0:19:57,26
I also wanted to put it
in its place and move on.


369
0:19:57,26 --> 0:20:0,68
I did become more
interested and appreciative


370
0:20:0,68 --> 0:20:3,48
of Steve's history,
but it was only


371
0:20:3,48 --> 0:20:8,2
after I had renewed my
perceptions of myself.


372
0:20:8,2 --> 0:20:12,6
As I mentioned before, I'd
been concerned all along


373
0:20:12,6 --> 0:20:16,54
that my writing book this
would be hard on our daughter.


374
0:20:16,54 --> 0:20:20,68
And the way that worked
is that the more I wrote,


375
0:20:20,68 --> 0:20:24,53
the more I felt it was going
to be a bigger problem for her


376
0:20:24,53 --> 0:20:31,7
and the world if the world
didn't have her mother's story


377
0:20:31,7 --> 0:20:35,29
and if I didn't become strong
and clear enough to tell it.


378
0:20:35,29 --> 0:20:38,22
I think that what
failed in Steve Jobs is


379
0:20:38,22 --> 0:20:40,78
as important as what succeeded.


380
0:20:40,78 --> 0:20:44,4
Both aspects should
be studied, partly


381
0:20:44,4 --> 0:20:46,15
because he's so remarkable.


382
0:20:46,15 --> 0:20:49,14
Well, because he's
so remarkable.


383
0:20:49,14 --> 0:20:57,0
Also I know that a woman's
inner story may seem far less


384
0:20:57,0 --> 0:21:5,42
exciting as a man's
worldly story.


385
0:21:5,42 --> 0:21:11,76
In fact, for women it may be
that the inner story of a woman


386
0:21:11,76 --> 0:21:14,54
is more interesting than
a man's worldly story.


387
0:21:14,54 --> 0:21:18,96
But beyond all this, I want
my great-great-grandchildren,


388
0:21:18,96 --> 0:21:21,35
should I be lucky
enough to have them,


389
0:21:21,35 --> 0:21:23,95
know what a bit of their
grandmother's life and times,


390
0:21:23,95 --> 0:21:26,35
as well as your grandfather's.


391
0:21:26,35 --> 0:21:28,89
I think it will be
healthy and happy for them


392
0:21:28,89 --> 0:21:32,95
because against all this dull
expectations, I feel Steve


393
0:21:32,95 --> 0:21:34,96
and I were equals.


394
0:21:34,96 --> 0:21:39,44
He simply had more power because
the laws favor men and money


395
0:21:39,44 --> 0:21:41,702
over women and
children at this time.


396
0:21:41,702 --> 0:21:43,785
I hope you don't mind me
being a little political.


397
0:21:43,785 --> 0:21:48,55



398
0:21:48,55 --> 0:21:54,9
The other thing that
truly inspired me to write


399
0:21:54,9 --> 0:21:58,23
is that in many ways my story
is an all too familiar one.


400
0:21:58,23 --> 0:22:2,0
Many women have had their own
experience with brilliant men.


401
0:22:2,0 --> 0:22:3,65
And truthfully,
it's not just women


402
0:22:3,65 --> 0:22:5,45
who are suffering
from the situation.


403
0:22:5,45 --> 0:22:8,98
Obviously, it's a destructive
context for all of us.


404
0:22:8,98 --> 0:22:13,12
The world is dealing with a huge
power imbalance, Wall Street,


405
0:22:13,12 --> 0:22:22,19
corporate heads,
news corporations,


406
0:22:22,19 --> 0:22:24,63
that sort of confuse
and drain people


407
0:22:24,63 --> 0:22:26,25
in their personal
power, at least


408
0:22:26,25 --> 0:22:27,7
that's the apparent reality.


409
0:22:27,7 --> 0:22:30,24



410
0:22:30,24 --> 0:22:36,31
So then I'd like to see
a genius bar working


411
0:22:36,31 --> 0:22:39,45
to fix the brokenness
at this level.


412
0:22:39,45 --> 0:22:44,3
Maybe we could call
it the ethics bar.


413
0:22:44,3 --> 0:22:45,91
Eventually, I
started to figure out


414
0:22:45,91 --> 0:22:49,2
that I could access the
highest integrity inside myself


415
0:22:49,2 --> 0:22:53,4
by steering my writing
between truth and kindness.


416
0:22:53,4 --> 0:22:56,73
If I could not say what
had to be said is kindness,


417
0:22:56,73 --> 0:22:59,48
then I kept working to
understand more deeply.


418
0:22:59,48 --> 0:23:2,72
If I could not tell the truth
because it was too terrible,


419
0:23:2,72 --> 0:23:5,4
then I kept looking
for ways to say things


420
0:23:5,4 --> 0:23:7,65
with more breath and allowance.


421
0:23:7,65 --> 0:23:12,91
The extremes of negative
and positive relationship


422
0:23:12,91 --> 0:23:18,85
in the adult Steve Jobs
and Chrisann Brennan


423
0:23:18,85 --> 0:23:22,89
were and still are too
problematic to be public about.


424
0:23:22,89 --> 0:23:24,81
And sometimes I was
thinking all the way


425
0:23:24,81 --> 0:23:27,62
through the book about
Jung's "Red Book,"


426
0:23:27,62 --> 0:23:29,53
the one he locked
up for 70 years


427
0:23:29,53 --> 0:23:31,61
because he didn't
think people were


428
0:23:31,61 --> 0:23:34,84
ready to take in the contents.


429
0:23:34,84 --> 0:23:38,29
And I completely understand
his impulse to hold back.


430
0:23:38,29 --> 0:23:42,16
Steve expanded the
spectrum in ways


431
0:23:42,16 --> 0:23:45,45
that went beyond the
range of humanness.


432
0:23:45,45 --> 0:23:48,22



433
0:23:48,22 --> 0:23:51,38
And I mean that in both the
good and the difficult way.


434
0:23:51,38 --> 0:23:54,2



435
0:23:54,2 --> 0:23:58,89
And I finally figured out
I could approach the story


436
0:23:58,89 --> 0:24:1,91
if I stayed in the middle.


437
0:24:1,91 --> 0:24:4,26
Then I could
express enough truth


438
0:24:4,26 --> 0:24:6,43
and that likely some
readers were even


439
0:24:6,43 --> 0:24:8,71
going to be able to sense
the shapes of the things


440
0:24:8,71 --> 0:24:10,92
I couldn't say.


441
0:24:10,92 --> 0:24:13,64
Another exercise I
put myself through


442
0:24:13,64 --> 0:24:17,47
was to pose the question,
if everything is love,


443
0:24:17,47 --> 0:24:21,63
if this whole universe
is love, which


444
0:24:21,63 --> 0:24:23,605
is what the mystics
support, and I


445
0:24:23,605 --> 0:24:28,5
am willing to believe,
how do I understand love


446
0:24:28,5 --> 0:24:33,59
in the context of what
happened between Steve and me?


447
0:24:33,59 --> 0:24:37,54
Love is law and law
is based on love.


448
0:24:37,54 --> 0:24:41,12
What happened was lawless.


449
0:24:41,12 --> 0:24:45,6
Yet, I didn't want to make Steve
look like a spot monster that


450
0:24:45,6 --> 0:24:47,26
was too big for me to handle.


451
0:24:47,26 --> 0:24:50,28
And I didn't want to make
myself into a tiny speck


452
0:24:50,28 --> 0:24:53,47
of a victim that
couldn't deal with it.


453
0:24:53,47 --> 0:24:55,84
That would have
been way too easy.


454
0:24:55,84 --> 0:24:58,65
I wanted to transcend
the polarization


455
0:24:58,65 --> 0:25:0,49
and the lawlessness.


456
0:25:0,49 --> 0:25:3,85
I wanted to find my power
in the center of it all.


457
0:25:3,85 --> 0:25:8,364
I wanted a kind of
equanimity, a true equanimity.


458
0:25:8,364 --> 0:25:11,27



459
0:25:11,27 --> 0:25:15,89
I think that Steve was
a remarkable empath, who


460
0:25:15,89 --> 0:25:19,87
became a colossal bully.


461
0:25:19,87 --> 0:25:22,85
I'm sorry for those
of you who love him.


462
0:25:22,85 --> 0:25:26,8
I think he was a liar, a
bully, a trickster, a thief.


463
0:25:26,8 --> 0:25:29,18
And I think he was a sociopath.


464
0:25:29,18 --> 0:25:35,6
Yet, he was also an honest,
remarkable, mystic, creator,


465
0:25:35,6 --> 0:25:39,32
genius, visionary, who
wanted to see people freed up


466
0:25:39,32 --> 0:25:41,84
through the tools he made.


467
0:25:41,84 --> 0:25:44,42
What a cluster.


468
0:25:44,42 --> 0:25:48,92
Another creative principle I
found in another Hindu text


469
0:25:48,92 --> 0:25:53,5
says, divided into
two parts I create.


470
0:25:53,5 --> 0:25:55,85
At first, I felt
blimied and even


471
0:25:55,85 --> 0:26:1,85
lazy to parse through the polar
opposites, his polar opposites.


472
0:26:1,85 --> 0:26:3,77
But then I became
very interested


473
0:26:3,77 --> 0:26:8,25
in understanding the differences
between Steve's light and dark


474
0:26:8,25 --> 0:26:13,6
sides because why else
should I write this book?


475
0:26:13,6 --> 0:26:15,13
The independent
spirit in me always


476
0:26:15,13 --> 0:26:17,32
got around to the
same conclusion.


477
0:26:17,32 --> 0:26:21,9
I choose to be bigger than the
cruelty and the indifference.


478
0:26:21,9 --> 0:26:22,91
I am going to tell
the truth and I'm


479
0:26:22,91 --> 0:26:25,85
going to trust that I
have the tools to do it


480
0:26:25,85 --> 0:26:27,57
without doing harm.


481
0:26:27,57 --> 0:26:32,62
Moreover, I may end
up having to trust


482
0:26:32,62 --> 0:26:36,64
the pieces to fly
and fall as they may.


483
0:26:36,64 --> 0:26:39,84
But I'm willing to
wager that in the end,


484
0:26:39,84 --> 0:26:44,68
the truth, told well
enough is a good thing.


485
0:26:44,68 --> 0:26:47,23
I call my book "The
Bite in the Apple"


486
0:26:47,23 --> 0:26:48,85
and not "out of the
Apple" because I


487
0:26:48,85 --> 0:26:52,75
wanted to recover wholeness of
all that had been shattered.


488
0:26:52,75 --> 0:26:55,33



489
0:26:55,33 --> 0:26:58,37
There are two trees at the
beginning of the Bible.


490
0:26:58,37 --> 0:27:1,79
One is the tree of
knowledge of good and evil


491
0:27:1,79 --> 0:27:4,16
and the other is
the tree of life.


492
0:27:4,16 --> 0:27:6,65
I wanted to put the
bite back in the apple


493
0:27:6,65 --> 0:27:10,29
and become the tree of life.


494
0:27:10,29 --> 0:27:13,63
No more talking snakes,
no more blaming woman


495
0:27:13,63 --> 0:27:15,46
for the fall of man.


496
0:27:15,46 --> 0:27:18,33
Writing this book was
my choice to return


497
0:27:18,33 --> 0:27:21,9
to my original
spirit of wholeness


498
0:27:21,9 --> 0:27:24,63
by way of my own work,
which was mine alone to do.


499
0:27:24,63 --> 0:27:27,49



500
0:27:27,49 --> 0:27:29,57
So now-- what time is it?


501
0:27:29,57 --> 0:27:30,746
OK.


502
0:27:30,746 --> 0:27:32,38
OK.


503
0:27:32,38 --> 0:27:35,7
So now I want to talk
about Steve's creativity.


504
0:27:35,7 --> 0:27:38,26
You all know more than I do,
as I said in the beginning,


505
0:27:38,26 --> 0:27:40,74
about Steve Jobs'
accomplishments.


506
0:27:40,74 --> 0:27:42,96
But I have probably
thought more about


507
0:27:42,96 --> 0:27:45,12
how his early years
shaped his creativity.


508
0:27:45,12 --> 0:27:47,77



509
0:27:47,77 --> 0:27:51,107
I knew Steve was a genius
when I first met him.


510
0:27:51,107 --> 0:27:52,69
Though if you ask
our daughter, she'll


511
0:27:52,69 --> 0:27:56,47
complain that I think
everyone is a genius.


512
0:27:56,47 --> 0:27:59,49
I hear her referring
to her mother's myths


513
0:27:59,49 --> 0:28:3,89
and I think she worries
I've fed her pretty lies.


514
0:28:3,89 --> 0:28:5,14
She is like Steve.


515
0:28:5,14 --> 0:28:7,54
She likes to get
the facts straight.


516
0:28:7,54 --> 0:28:10,4
But I absolutely know
what I'm talking about.


517
0:28:10,4 --> 0:28:14,5
I do believe everyone
has genius in them.


518
0:28:14,5 --> 0:28:17,54
One difference between
Steve and most other people


519
0:28:17,54 --> 0:28:21,19
is that he figured out what
the work of his unique genius


520
0:28:21,19 --> 0:28:24,872
was and he didn't allow himself
to be distracted from it.


521
0:28:24,872 --> 0:28:27,71



522
0:28:27,71 --> 0:28:30,76
He never gave up
and he never forgot


523
0:28:30,76 --> 0:28:32,73
that there was
infinite potential


524
0:28:32,73 --> 0:28:35,56
in a finite amount of time.


525
0:28:35,56 --> 0:28:39,78
At the same time, I do feel
he lost some sweetness--


526
0:28:39,78 --> 0:28:43,305
the sweetness of life in the
pursuit of all he accomplished.


527
0:28:43,305 --> 0:28:46,5



528
0:28:46,5 --> 0:28:48,8
The time in which
Steve and I came of age


529
0:28:48,8 --> 0:28:52,2
was marked by disillusionment
with our parents' value system.


530
0:28:52,2 --> 0:28:55,46
The '50s were filled with
the Cold War mentality,


531
0:28:55,46 --> 0:29:0,86
superficial materialism as
the answer to a fulfilled life


532
0:29:0,86 --> 0:29:5,71
and also the inauthenticity of
male and female role playing.


533
0:29:5,71 --> 0:29:8,7
And we found ourselves rebels.


534
0:29:8,7 --> 0:29:9,5
We were turning into rebels.


535
0:29:9,5 --> 0:29:11,45
But we weren't rebels
without a cause.


536
0:29:11,45 --> 0:29:14,73
In fact, we felt that we should
break the rules because they


537
0:29:14,73 --> 0:29:17,0
were inadequate to
the sense that there


538
0:29:17,0 --> 0:29:19,55
was something bigger to be had.


539
0:29:19,55 --> 0:29:23,67
In 1983, I talked a writer
from "Time Magazine,"


540
0:29:23,67 --> 0:29:26,65
who told me that when he
interviewed Steve Wozniak's


541
0:29:26,65 --> 0:29:29,26
and Steve Jobs'
teachers in high school


542
0:29:29,26 --> 0:29:34,19
after Apple had
started to succeed,


543
0:29:34,19 --> 0:29:37,61
he said that they all
reported those years were


544
0:29:37,61 --> 0:29:41,43
a rare time at the school
in every area of study


545
0:29:41,43 --> 0:29:44,93
because kids were so
uncommonly creative and full


546
0:29:44,93 --> 0:29:47,15
of self-authority.


547
0:29:47,15 --> 0:29:50,8
That was that time.


548
0:29:50,8 --> 0:29:51,88
Later, I spoke with
an attorney who


549
0:29:51,88 --> 0:29:54,74
went to a Catholic
school in Santa Clara


550
0:29:54,74 --> 0:29:57,3
at the same time Steve
and I were at Homestead.


551
0:29:57,3 --> 0:29:59,72
And he told me that his
school was similarly


552
0:29:59,72 --> 0:30:3,45
struck by some kind of fierce
originality, that came and went


553
0:30:3,45 --> 0:30:6,83
within a period of something
like seven to 10 years.


554
0:30:6,83 --> 0:30:12,14
Now I think what a
crazy alchemy, LSD,


555
0:30:12,14 --> 0:30:16,51
Eastern mysticism, the
burgeoning technology of IBM,


556
0:30:16,51 --> 0:30:22,73
the brute power of Lockheed,
all coming up at the same time,


557
0:30:22,73 --> 0:30:26,54
creating new combinations
for re-envisioning design,


558
0:30:26,54 --> 0:30:29,78
the value of aesthetics
in technology,


559
0:30:29,78 --> 0:30:34,476
planetary interconnectedness,
and flower power.


560
0:30:34,476 --> 0:30:37,945
I'm going to put this up.


561
0:30:37,945 --> 0:30:40,96
This is another painting I did.


562
0:30:40,96 --> 0:30:45,14



563
0:30:45,14 --> 0:30:46,68
Now I'm going to tell
you a story that's


564
0:30:46,68 --> 0:30:48,97
a part of Steve's past.


565
0:30:48,97 --> 0:30:50,76
At first, it may
not seem to connect


566
0:30:50,76 --> 0:30:53,8
to the theme of this
talk, creativity.


567
0:30:53,8 --> 0:30:55,36
But you'll see why I
think it does shortly.


568
0:30:55,36 --> 0:30:58,67
But first, take a
trip back to 1972.


569
0:30:58,67 --> 0:31:1,92
The third time I met
Steve's mother Clara Jobs,


570
0:31:1,92 --> 0:31:5,11
I was standing alone in the
living room waiting for Steve.


571
0:31:5,11 --> 0:31:8,72
She came in and in an
urgent way began telling me


572
0:31:8,72 --> 0:31:12,9
that they had adopted Steve, but
that the birth mother had taken


573
0:31:12,9 --> 0:31:14,1
them to court because
she didn't want


574
0:31:14,1 --> 0:31:16,3
her son raised by the Jobs.


575
0:31:16,3 --> 0:31:21,9
In 1955, Joanne Schieble,
pregnant with Steve--


576
0:31:21,9 --> 0:31:24,26
I actually don't know how
to pronounce her name.


577
0:31:24,26 --> 0:31:29,63
My apologies-- had chosen a
family that was well educated,


578
0:31:29,63 --> 0:31:31,92
wealthy, and Catholic,
for her baby.


579
0:31:31,92 --> 0:31:35,68
But that couple decided
that they wanted a girl.


580
0:31:35,68 --> 0:31:39,55
So the adoption
agency gave Steve


581
0:31:39,55 --> 0:31:44,35
to Clara and Paul Jobs, who
had none of those qualities.


582
0:31:44,35 --> 0:31:46,8
Clara told me that they
had to fight to keep him.


583
0:31:46,8 --> 0:31:50,34
And then confessed
that she had been


584
0:31:50,34 --> 0:31:54,26
terrified to love Steve for the
first six months of his life


585
0:31:54,26 --> 0:31:58,4
for fear that they were going
to take him away from her.


586
0:31:58,4 --> 0:32:0,1
At that, she just stared at me.


587
0:32:0,1 --> 0:32:6,97
And I saw in her face a
deep, matter-of-fact guilt.


588
0:32:6,97 --> 0:32:9,29
And then she told me
that even after they


589
0:32:9,29 --> 0:32:12,41
had won the case, when
he was two years old


590
0:32:12,41 --> 0:32:14,71
he was so difficult
a child to parent


591
0:32:14,71 --> 0:32:18,13
that she wanted to give
him back to the agency.


592
0:32:18,13 --> 0:32:20,4
And I think she may
have been trying


593
0:32:20,4 --> 0:32:23,96
to indicate a root
cause to his cold side.


594
0:32:23,96 --> 0:32:26,3
But that day I was
totally clueless


595
0:32:26,3 --> 0:32:28,26
and would be for some
time because Steve


596
0:32:28,26 --> 0:32:29,94
was very good to me.


597
0:32:29,94 --> 0:32:35,72
Instead, I wondered why on
Earth my new boyfriend's mother


598
0:32:35,72 --> 0:32:38,97
was telling me so much
personal information.


599
0:32:38,97 --> 0:32:41,91
I was concerned about
her and wondered


600
0:32:41,91 --> 0:32:44,77
in a simple
17-year-old way if they


601
0:32:44,77 --> 0:32:47,87
did come to love
and cherish him.


602
0:32:47,87 --> 0:32:50,83
Not long after that
conversation with his mother,


603
0:32:50,83 --> 0:32:53,48
Steve started warning me too.


604
0:32:53,48 --> 0:32:59,19
He told me on a number occasions
and in a number of ways,


605
0:32:59,19 --> 0:33:2,83
he knew he was going to lose his
humanity in the business world


606
0:33:2,83 --> 0:33:4,302
when he grew up.


607
0:33:4,302 --> 0:33:7,71
I didn't know what
to think, starting


608
0:33:7,71 --> 0:33:12,59
with was this something that
men knew and worried about?


609
0:33:12,59 --> 0:33:16,95
I also wondered, how did he
know his future because I


610
0:33:16,95 --> 0:33:20,12
had no sense for mine.


611
0:33:20,12 --> 0:33:23,9
Back then, we were
just young lovers.


612
0:33:23,9 --> 0:33:25,28
We moved in together
the summer before he


613
0:33:25,28 --> 0:33:30,0
went to college,
an idyllic setting,


614
0:33:30,0 --> 0:33:33,23
where we fell more in love.


615
0:33:33,23 --> 0:33:35,37
Then he left for
Reed College and I


616
0:33:35,37 --> 0:33:39,77
returned for my final
year of high school.


617
0:33:39,77 --> 0:33:42,39
Late that fall, Steve
called and told me


618
0:33:42,39 --> 0:33:44,46
he'd dropped out
of Reed, but was


619
0:33:44,46 --> 0:33:49,19
staying in Oregon
to audit classes.


620
0:33:49,19 --> 0:33:53,3
It's important to know here that
the crucial aspect in resolving


621
0:33:53,3 --> 0:33:55,94
the court case with
Steve's birth mother


622
0:33:55,94 --> 0:34:2,1
was that Paul and Clara
agreed to send him to college.


623
0:34:2,1 --> 0:34:7,8
In fact, it was the most crucial
factor, maybe even the only,


624
0:34:7,8 --> 0:34:12,659
in getting his biological mother
to leave him in their home.


625
0:34:12,659 --> 0:34:15,67
But Steve was deeply
conflicted because he


626
0:34:15,67 --> 0:34:18,699
was well aware of Paul's
anger and discomfort


627
0:34:18,699 --> 0:34:22,489
about spending so much
money on his education.


628
0:34:22,489 --> 0:34:26,4
Higher education wasn't a
part of the Jobs' experience


629
0:34:26,4 --> 0:34:29,62
or value system.


630
0:34:29,62 --> 0:34:33,659
Nor, apparently, was it to
keep their legal obligations


631
0:34:33,659 --> 0:34:37,37
to the court and to the
birth mother of their son.


632
0:34:37,37 --> 0:34:42,34
At 17, Paul and Clara
let Steve decide.


633
0:34:42,34 --> 0:34:44,8
And he took things
into its own hands


634
0:34:44,8 --> 0:34:48,9
and started auditing
courses that interested him.


635
0:34:48,9 --> 0:34:51,37
I think it's instructive
to look at what


636
0:34:51,37 --> 0:34:54,29
happened when Steve
dropped out of school.


637
0:34:54,29 --> 0:34:58,41
Here we have a brilliant
prince of a genius integrating


638
0:34:58,41 --> 0:35:2,28
the values of his
working class parents,


639
0:35:2,28 --> 0:35:4,71
a guy who by any
standard should've


640
0:35:4,71 --> 0:35:7,23
been given higher education.


641
0:35:7,23 --> 0:35:11,5
But instead rerouted himself for
a different kind of emergence


642
0:35:11,5 --> 0:35:14,48
into adulthood, so
as not too impinge


643
0:35:14,48 --> 0:35:20,46
or be a burden on these people
whose feelings he cared about.


644
0:35:20,46 --> 0:35:23,24
So there's three things I'm
getting from this-- that I've


645
0:35:23,24 --> 0:35:25,8
thought about with this.


646
0:35:25,8 --> 0:35:29,57
One, it seems to me that
the breach in the contract


647
0:35:29,57 --> 0:35:37,945
was the beginning of a spiraling
out of right order in the sense


648
0:35:37,945 --> 0:35:41,12
that it modeled the dropping
of right regard for Steve's


649
0:35:41,12 --> 0:35:44,3
mother and the contract.


650
0:35:44,3 --> 0:35:47,75
One might think it doesn't
matter because it was so long


651
0:35:47,75 --> 0:35:50,79
ago and they had
put so much time in.


652
0:35:50,79 --> 0:35:54,66
But dishonoring the mother and
the agreement in a court of law


653
0:35:54,66 --> 0:35:58,87
set a pattern, or
it revealed one.


654
0:35:58,87 --> 0:36:3,24
Two, if Paul and Clara had
been paying for the classes,


655
0:36:3,24 --> 0:36:5,62
they would have
likely interfered,


656
0:36:5,62 --> 0:36:8,985
or Steve would have
interfered with himself,


657
0:36:8,985 --> 0:36:13,74
of Steve's being so playful
about his choices, dance,


658
0:36:13,74 --> 0:36:16,15
calligraphy, and Shakespeare.


659
0:36:16,15 --> 0:36:20,92
Reed College was after all
known for its math and sciences,


660
0:36:20,92 --> 0:36:23,69
which is why it was
a good fit for Steve.


661
0:36:23,69 --> 0:36:26,11
So the arts classes
would have seemed


662
0:36:26,11 --> 0:36:32,9
anomalous to his obvious
intellectual talents.


663
0:36:32,9 --> 0:36:33,94
Strike that.


664
0:36:33,94 --> 0:36:36,53
I think-- anyway, strike that.


665
0:36:36,53 --> 0:36:39,36
Three, after dropping
out of school,


666
0:36:39,36 --> 0:36:43,69
Steve stumbled around
for a while and suffered.


667
0:36:43,69 --> 0:36:45,99
Though he remained
sweet and positive


668
0:36:45,99 --> 0:36:49,3
in his nature during
that searching time,


669
0:36:49,3 --> 0:36:52,69
hitchhiking between the
Bay Area and Portland,


670
0:36:52,69 --> 0:36:55,17
he was like a bird on the wire.


671
0:36:55,17 --> 0:36:57,2
And there was a
deep rootlessness,


672
0:36:57,2 --> 0:36:59,83
one might say
homelessness in him,


673
0:36:59,83 --> 0:37:1,25
as he tried to
figure out what he


674
0:37:1,25 --> 0:37:4,22
was going to do with his life.


675
0:37:4,22 --> 0:37:7,29
I want you to know how
hard that was for him.


676
0:37:7,29 --> 0:37:8,29
I was there.


677
0:37:8,29 --> 0:37:8,9
I saw it.


678
0:37:8,9 --> 0:37:10,6
It was painful.


679
0:37:10,6 --> 0:37:13,32
He was deeply worried
about his life.


680
0:37:13,32 --> 0:37:17,5
Also I was
disenchanted with him.


681
0:37:17,5 --> 0:37:19,8
So I was not of much help.


682
0:37:19,8 --> 0:37:21,96
But I don't think there
was anything anybody


683
0:37:21,96 --> 0:37:23,82
could do for him.


684
0:37:23,82 --> 0:37:26,36
He had to find his own way.


685
0:37:26,36 --> 0:37:29,42
And yet he was
finding his own way


686
0:37:29,42 --> 0:37:32,88
by looking at all
possible failure.


687
0:37:32,88 --> 0:37:35,55
He knew there was something
that was supposed to happen.


688
0:37:35,55 --> 0:37:38,6
Because just as he
had told me that he


689
0:37:38,6 --> 0:37:41,27
was going to lose his humanity
in the business world,


690
0:37:41,27 --> 0:37:46,28
he also told me that there was
something big that he was going


691
0:37:46,28 --> 0:37:50,22
to do that would make
him famous and wealthy.


692
0:37:50,22 --> 0:37:52,42
He didn't know what it was.


693
0:37:52,42 --> 0:37:56,44
And I feel that it
was at that time


694
0:37:56,44 --> 0:38:0,74
when he didn't know
what he was going to do


695
0:38:0,74 --> 0:38:3,66
and feared he might
have missed it,


696
0:38:3,66 --> 0:38:7,18
that I saw him become
mean spirited and stare


697
0:38:7,18 --> 0:38:15,38
future down-- good Freudian
slip-- stare failure down.


698
0:38:15,38 --> 0:38:19,18
And I feel this was the
beginning of his leadership


699
0:38:19,18 --> 0:38:21,9
development.


700
0:38:21,9 --> 0:38:25,5
Calamity, or rather the
flip side of calamity,


701
0:38:25,5 --> 0:38:28,99
offers insight into
the creative process.


702
0:38:28,99 --> 0:38:31,69
There is something about
how everything that gets


703
0:38:31,69 --> 0:38:34,6
missed, gets tilled
under, and then


704
0:38:34,6 --> 0:38:38,55
grows up into something greater.


705
0:38:38,55 --> 0:38:43,26
This is a truism I think we
can all feel confidence in.


706
0:38:43,26 --> 0:38:45,36
Like things don't get missed.


707
0:38:45,36 --> 0:38:49,82
They go back under and find
other ways to come back up.


708
0:38:49,82 --> 0:38:53,76
The irony, which is not the
best word for what happened,


709
0:38:53,76 --> 0:38:56,89
is that even though he
did not go to school,


710
0:38:56,89 --> 0:39:0,31
the personal computer
is the tool that


711
0:39:0,31 --> 0:39:5,8
in the not so distant future
will enable a truly class world


712
0:39:5,8 --> 0:39:11,701
education for every child
on Earth, affordably so.


713
0:39:11,701 --> 0:39:17,2
The lesson, never underestimate
the power for failure.


714
0:39:17,2 --> 0:39:22,682
It's a resource of immense
untapped potential,


715
0:39:22,682 --> 0:39:26,65
because everybody keeps
trying to do things right.


716
0:39:26,65 --> 0:39:29,86
The trauma of early
childhood, the abandonment


717
0:39:29,86 --> 0:39:33,0
by both mothers in
the first six months,


718
0:39:33,0 --> 0:39:37,35
probably had the most profound
effect on Steve's creativity.


719
0:39:37,35 --> 0:39:40,39
In fact, I don't think there's
anything that ever happened


720
0:39:40,39 --> 0:39:43,36
to him that he
didn't end up using.


721
0:39:43,36 --> 0:39:46,69
So how might Steve's adoption
and the resulting attachment


722
0:39:46,69 --> 0:39:51,49
disorder have affected his
extremely sensitive creator


723
0:39:51,49 --> 0:39:54,57
self to make him a natural
part of the development


724
0:39:54,57 --> 0:39:58,27
of a technology that
will connect the world?


725
0:39:58,27 --> 0:40:1,46
In musing over this,
I leaped to the idea


726
0:40:1,46 --> 0:40:3,56
that because Steve
did not know what


727
0:40:3,56 --> 0:40:7,7
real connection
with a mother was


728
0:40:7,7 --> 0:40:9,92
at such an important
developmental stage,


729
0:40:9,92 --> 0:40:12,7
that he became a
part of inventing


730
0:40:12,7 --> 0:40:14,89
a new kind of connection.


731
0:40:14,89 --> 0:40:17,95
Trauma can cut people down.


732
0:40:17,95 --> 0:40:21,59
But it could also
wake people up.


733
0:40:21,59 --> 0:40:23,62
Some part of Steve
woke up when you


734
0:40:23,62 --> 0:40:27,5
he separated from his birth
mother-- I mean I think so--


735
0:40:27,5 --> 0:40:30,86
and after that, because his
adoptive mother didn't embrace


736
0:40:30,86 --> 0:40:34,87
him for six months,
I think he was stuck,


737
0:40:34,87 --> 0:40:39,39
mobilized, wired, and focused
to look for connection,


738
0:40:39,39 --> 0:40:43,36
at the same time not understand
what he was looking for.


739
0:40:43,36 --> 0:40:47,14
This is my personal
experience with him as well.


740
0:40:47,14 --> 0:40:52,49
And when we consider how
technology is more and more


741
0:40:52,49 --> 0:40:55,92
replacing face-to-face,
intimate contact,


742
0:40:55,92 --> 0:41:0,47
I wonder if there isn't
something of his attachment


743
0:41:0,47 --> 0:41:3,43
disorder built right into
the technology itself.


744
0:41:3,43 --> 0:41:6,3



745
0:41:6,3 --> 0:41:11,96
Before this amazing
techie world we exist in,


746
0:41:11,96 --> 0:41:17,4
I was around to see how Woz and
Steve related to each other.


747
0:41:17,4 --> 0:41:20,22
The two geniuses, three
years apart in age,


748
0:41:20,22 --> 0:41:23,58
met regularly as friends
do and talked over


749
0:41:23,58 --> 0:41:27,36
their most recent
ideas and discoveries.


750
0:41:27,36 --> 0:41:29,23
I didn't know what
they were talking about


751
0:41:29,23 --> 0:41:30,25
and I didn't care.


752
0:41:30,25 --> 0:41:33,12
Instead, I loved
watching the acceleration


753
0:41:33,12 --> 0:41:35,7
of their exchanges,
the bright, happy flow,


754
0:41:35,7 --> 0:41:37,47
the shock of the new.


755
0:41:37,47 --> 0:41:40,44
They seemed to be very
animated, jump up and down,


756
0:41:40,44 --> 0:41:43,16
talk over and around each
other, in Paul's garage


757
0:41:43,16 --> 0:41:44,9
and other places too.


758
0:41:44,9 --> 0:41:47,59
It was like a duet
of a great affection.


759
0:41:47,59 --> 0:41:51,17
Sometimes they could barely get
their words out fast enough,


760
0:41:51,17 --> 0:41:53,34
finishing each other's
sentences and laughing


761
0:41:53,34 --> 0:41:55,42
to acknowledge all
that did not need


762
0:41:55,42 --> 0:41:58,46
to be said, because
as Steve might say,


763
0:41:58,46 --> 0:42:1,87
insanely great
minds think alike.


764
0:42:1,87 --> 0:42:4,1
Yet as true as that
was, sometimes it


765
0:42:4,1 --> 0:42:6,29
went over the edge
for me because there


766
0:42:6,29 --> 0:42:8,14
was something else going on.


767
0:42:8,14 --> 0:42:13,5
I'd forgotten about this other
thing until I started writing.


768
0:42:13,5 --> 0:42:17,1
Their speech patterns could
be so rapid fire, their tones


769
0:42:17,1 --> 0:42:19,84
so shrill, that it
was as disturbing


770
0:42:19,84 --> 0:42:22,47
as fingernails on a blackboard.


771
0:42:22,47 --> 0:42:24,37
And I'm not exaggerating.


772
0:42:24,37 --> 0:42:27,2
It was awful.


773
0:42:27,2 --> 0:42:28,81
When the memory
of this weirdness


774
0:42:28,81 --> 0:42:32,36
came back to me when
I was writing my book,


775
0:42:32,36 --> 0:42:37,8
it occurred to me that something
about how they were relating


776
0:42:37,8 --> 0:42:40,66
may well have been the
beginning of what would later


777
0:42:40,66 --> 0:42:44,2
be coined the "reality
distortion field" because it


778
0:42:44,2 --> 0:42:48,3
felt like something being
torn out of coherence.


779
0:42:48,3 --> 0:42:51,89
As I say, it wasn't always
this way, but just at those


780
0:42:51,89 --> 0:42:54,3
times when the sounds
were so unbearable


781
0:42:54,3 --> 0:42:57,69
that I'd get myself
out of hearing range.


782
0:42:57,69 --> 0:43:0,51
Often I'd sit in the living
room at the Jobs's and wait


783
0:43:0,51 --> 0:43:1,93
for it to be over.


784
0:43:1,93 --> 0:43:7,92
And I did not ask myself why
or what it was, but I do now.


785
0:43:7,92 --> 0:43:11,89
I think the technology has a
double edge of both connecting


786
0:43:11,89 --> 0:43:15,9
and disconnecting people to
and from each other, Steve


787
0:43:15,9 --> 0:43:17,64
and Steve, with a
double edged sword that


788
0:43:17,64 --> 0:43:20,89
connected and disconnected
things at the same time.


789
0:43:20,89 --> 0:43:22,7
Do we know what they were doing?


790
0:43:22,7 --> 0:43:24,98
Do they know what
they were doing?


791
0:43:24,98 --> 0:43:27,53
I think we need to be
more conscious and intense


792
0:43:27,53 --> 0:43:31,75
about asking what the technology
is doing to us, biologically,


793
0:43:31,75 --> 0:43:35,345
emotionally, intellectually,
and spiritually, creating


794
0:43:35,345 --> 0:43:37,97
a serious, serious business.


795
0:43:37,97 --> 0:43:43,7



796
0:43:43,7 --> 0:43:46,23
Many people who came of age
before the personal computer


797
0:43:46,23 --> 0:43:50,79
can remember such an
extraordinary sense of beauty


798
0:43:50,79 --> 0:43:53,56
and potential in the
air in the '60s and '70s


799
0:43:53,56 --> 0:43:57,3
and wonder what happened
to all that promise.


800
0:43:57,3 --> 0:44:0,21
Anybody, like over 50,
might remember this.


801
0:44:0,21 --> 0:44:1,3
You can ask them.


802
0:44:1,3 --> 0:44:2,365
They may have this memory.


803
0:44:2,365 --> 0:44:5,38



804
0:44:5,38 --> 0:44:7,95
Did something truly
over the top remarkable


805
0:44:7,95 --> 0:44:10,37
open up and then fail
in some important way


806
0:44:10,37 --> 0:44:12,17
to fulfill itself?


807
0:44:12,17 --> 0:44:15,13
I live in Monterrey
County right now.


808
0:44:15,13 --> 0:44:19,996
In the romantic history of
Cannery Row and Steinbeck,


809
0:44:19,996 --> 0:44:21,37
there came a time
when there were


810
0:44:21,37 --> 0:44:24,23
no more sardines in the sea.


811
0:44:24,23 --> 0:44:27,69
The industry was fished
out and had closed down.


812
0:44:27,69 --> 0:44:30,38
And all the people who
make their livelihoods off


813
0:44:30,38 --> 0:44:32,88
that industry were
greatly alarmed


814
0:44:32,88 --> 0:44:35,71
and asked where did
the sardines go?


815
0:44:35,71 --> 0:44:39,1
It was as if they were looking
into the wine-dark sea,


816
0:44:39,1 --> 0:44:41,61
unable to see the
bleeding obvious.


817
0:44:41,61 --> 0:44:46,58
The answer came by way of
one Ed Ricketts, a scientist,


818
0:44:46,58 --> 0:44:52,53
a philosopher, a early
ecologist, and a friend


819
0:44:52,53 --> 0:44:56,63
of Steinbeck, Henry Miller,
and Joseph Campbell.


820
0:44:56,63 --> 0:44:59,9
He was a remarkable
guy by all accounts.


821
0:44:59,9 --> 0:45:2,64
And he simply said,
"they're in the cans."


822
0:45:2,64 --> 0:45:4,89
I believe the
extraordinary vision


823
0:45:4,89 --> 0:45:8,3
that so many felt
in the '60s and '70s


824
0:45:8,3 --> 0:45:13,69
got absorbed into the computer
age, a kind of can if you will,


825
0:45:13,69 --> 0:45:17,86
so much mental, an
intricate kind of can.


826
0:45:17,86 --> 0:45:22,6
And now I know I'm
singing to the choir.


827
0:45:22,6 --> 0:45:24,54
I perceive I'm
singing to the choir.


828
0:45:24,54 --> 0:45:27,2
So I'll just continue.


829
0:45:27,2 --> 0:45:29,1
I believe that we
need new visions now.


830
0:45:29,1 --> 0:45:30,71
We upped the game
with the computer.


831
0:45:30,71 --> 0:45:34,65
But I think it's taken up too
much space in our imaginations,


832
0:45:34,65 --> 0:45:36,55
to the point of flattening them.


833
0:45:36,55 --> 0:45:39,85
There's too much focus
on screens, on function,


834
0:45:39,85 --> 0:45:41,58
and on transaction.


835
0:45:41,58 --> 0:45:45,32
I feel we need to swing back
to free up our imaginations


836
0:45:45,32 --> 0:45:48,94
for new kinds of questions,
more balanced, with greater


837
0:45:48,94 --> 0:45:51,46
attention to
integrity and nature


838
0:45:51,46 --> 0:45:56,67
and value of face-to-face
intimacy of our humanness.


839
0:45:56,67 --> 0:45:59,79
I think a lot of people
are haunted by Steve.


840
0:45:59,79 --> 0:46:3,8
His creativity was
so over the top


841
0:46:3,8 --> 0:46:5,67
that I hear many
question with anguish,


842
0:46:5,67 --> 0:46:8,9
what would Steve Jobs have done?


843
0:46:8,9 --> 0:46:12,32
What would he have gone on to
create had he lived longer.


844
0:46:12,32 --> 0:46:16,75
And I want to say, I don't think
this is the right question.


845
0:46:16,75 --> 0:46:21,73
His death is really sad.


846
0:46:21,73 --> 0:46:25,73
And he boggled the
imagination of so many


847
0:46:25,73 --> 0:46:27,81
around the whole world.


848
0:46:27,81 --> 0:46:34,2
And yet if we want to show
appreciation for all he did,


849
0:46:34,2 --> 0:46:36,53
why not take the
best of his example


850
0:46:36,53 --> 0:46:43,87
as inspiration to ask new kinds
of questions of one's self,


851
0:46:43,87 --> 0:46:46,45
for new kinds of frontiers?


852
0:46:46,45 --> 0:46:48,43
He was a unique contributor.


853
0:46:48,43 --> 0:46:51,845
And he got a remarkable
ball up into the air.


854
0:46:51,845 --> 0:46:57,55
Yet I think we need other
kinds of balls in air now too.


855
0:46:57,55 --> 0:47:0,37
A good question is a
very powerful thing.


856
0:47:0,37 --> 0:47:3,32
Once it's been asked,
the genius inside,


857
0:47:3,32 --> 0:47:8,59
the person who asked it of
themself, or heard it asked,


858
0:47:8,59 --> 0:47:10,51
will work day and
night, through their


859
0:47:10,51 --> 0:47:14,5
conscious and
unconscious, to answer it.


860
0:47:14,5 --> 0:47:17,92
I mean if Jesus said of
his own remarkable life,


861
0:47:17,92 --> 0:47:20,46
"this and more
shall you do," then


862
0:47:20,46 --> 0:47:25,44
I think we have a directive to
be mindful and imaginative--


863
0:47:25,44 --> 0:47:31,25
why are we imaginative about
the truth of everyone's


864
0:47:31,25 --> 0:47:34,57
creative capacity,
not just potential,


865
0:47:34,57 --> 0:47:37,82
but a person's
individual imperative.


866
0:47:37,82 --> 0:47:41,69
I think people are
haunted by Steve Jobs


867
0:47:41,69 --> 0:47:45,285
not quite because of
what he accomplished.


868
0:47:45,285 --> 0:47:52,6
But because he tapped into a
level of creativity in himself


869
0:47:52,6 --> 0:47:56,19
in such a significant
way that it suggests


870
0:47:56,19 --> 0:47:58,81
this too is possible.


871
0:47:58,81 --> 0:47:59,96
This is where it's haunted.


872
0:47:59,96 --> 0:48:13,2



873
0:48:13,2 --> 0:48:16,67
I believe his
creativity is at least


874
0:48:16,67 --> 0:48:20,53
as great as the
computer, at least.


875
0:48:20,53 --> 0:48:23,11
Steve Jobs was enlightened.


876
0:48:23,11 --> 0:48:28,17
He was what enlightenment looks
like in a business context.


877
0:48:28,17 --> 0:48:31,5
And yet because he never
received the love of a mother


878
0:48:31,5 --> 0:48:35,56
when he was so young,
he was an example


879
0:48:35,56 --> 0:48:39,22
of harnessing an awakened
state without being emotionally


880
0:48:39,22 --> 0:48:40,79
integrated.


881
0:48:40,79 --> 0:48:43,49
This is quite a combination.


882
0:48:43,49 --> 0:48:47,0
And though he
didn't do so badly,


883
0:48:47,0 --> 0:48:50,9
it does give us a clue
into why he did not


884
0:48:50,9 --> 0:48:55,56
spearhead a new
level of ecological


885
0:48:55,56 --> 0:48:59,66
and compassionate best business
practices around the world


886
0:48:59,66 --> 0:49:2,68
when he, of all
people, was so inspired


887
0:49:2,68 --> 0:49:5,14
and in a position to do so.


888
0:49:5,14 --> 0:49:8,94
One of the pillars of
enlightenment is self love.


889
0:49:8,94 --> 0:49:12,48
And I think that bereft of
the real heart connection


890
0:49:12,48 --> 0:49:14,39
with both mothers
when it mattered,


891
0:49:14,39 --> 0:49:18,25
that Steve just kept building
wealth to compensate.


892
0:49:18,25 --> 0:49:20,59
I'm not looking for blame.


893
0:49:20,59 --> 0:49:24,72
But I'm thinking more in
terms of an agreed upon course


894
0:49:24,72 --> 0:49:28,81
correction into the
future of technology.


895
0:49:28,81 --> 0:49:31,75
My impression is
that the technology


896
0:49:31,75 --> 0:49:35,22
needs to be redesigned so that
it works more harmoniously


897
0:49:35,22 --> 0:49:37,44
with the human energy system.


898
0:49:37,44 --> 0:49:39,3
I don't mean ergonomics.


899
0:49:39,3 --> 0:49:40,51
I'm talking about
the development


900
0:49:40,51 --> 0:49:43,29
of the harmonics
of the technology


901
0:49:43,29 --> 0:49:46,36
for the full dimension
of our humanness.


902
0:49:46,36 --> 0:49:49,0
We all know a day
spent on the computer


903
0:49:49,0 --> 0:49:51,9
can give us a feeling
of a day lost,


904
0:49:51,9 --> 0:49:55,78
or I think we feel that way--
I'm talking for everybody--


905
0:49:55,78 --> 0:50:1,35
somehow gone unlived,
even if we got a lot done.


906
0:50:1,35 --> 0:50:5,6
There's an emptiness and
an emotional flatness.


907
0:50:5,6 --> 0:50:9,13
It's as if we're making
new forms all the time


908
0:50:9,13 --> 0:50:11,54
and the brilliance
is uncontestable.


909
0:50:11,54 --> 0:50:13,74
But are we evolving
and enriching


910
0:50:13,74 --> 0:50:17,36
our humanness and
human experience?


911
0:50:17,36 --> 0:50:19,16
For example, here's an idea.


912
0:50:19,16 --> 0:50:20,38
And I'm almost finished.


913
0:50:20,38 --> 0:50:24,86



914
0:50:24,86 --> 0:50:28,16
Consider the cell phone
as the new cigarette.


915
0:50:28,16 --> 0:50:30,93
Its energy is gray and graying.


916
0:50:30,93 --> 0:50:33,39
People go off by
themselves to use it.


917
0:50:33,39 --> 0:50:35,9
They reach for it
unthinkingly as a distraction,


918
0:50:35,9 --> 0:50:37,61
with the same regularity.


919
0:50:37,61 --> 0:50:41,35
It's addictive and it lights up.


920
0:50:41,35 --> 0:50:43,8
So here we have an
example of wanting


921
0:50:43,8 --> 0:50:49,63
to connect while the behavior
actually blocks connection.


922
0:50:49,63 --> 0:50:53,4
In my imagination, I think that
a company, one at the cutting


923
0:50:53,4 --> 0:50:57,15
edge of the market into
the future of technology,


924
0:50:57,15 --> 0:51:0,23
they'd hire an unusual
kind of workforce


925
0:51:0,23 --> 0:51:3,2
to start figuring out how
to make the technology


926
0:51:3,2 --> 0:51:6,29
work with our biological,
emotional, intellectual,


927
0:51:6,29 --> 0:51:9,92
and spiritual constitutions.


928
0:51:9,92 --> 0:51:11,74
OK, two more paragraphs.


929
0:51:11,74 --> 0:51:13,67
Our machines are cool.


930
0:51:13,67 --> 0:51:17,61
And thanks to Steve's exquisite
sensibility and insistence,


931
0:51:17,61 --> 0:51:19,96
they are more
beautiful than ever.


932
0:51:19,96 --> 0:51:22,77
But I think we
are too impressed.


933
0:51:22,77 --> 0:51:25,12
They're supposed to serve us.


934
0:51:25,12 --> 0:51:27,32
We should not be
serving them-- we


935
0:51:27,32 --> 0:51:30,5
should not serve them,
nor pattern after them,


936
0:51:30,5 --> 0:51:32,48
nor be entrained by them.


937
0:51:32,48 --> 0:51:35,5
The technology is powerful.


938
0:51:35,5 --> 0:51:38,89
But the discernment
is that it's only


939
0:51:38,89 --> 0:51:41,99
as good as the person
who uses it being


940
0:51:41,99 --> 0:51:46,25
responsible to their
own unique heart vision.


941
0:51:46,25 --> 0:51:54,14
And so I want to read something
from my Henry Miller days.


942
0:51:54,14 --> 0:51:57,93



943
0:51:57,93 --> 0:52:0,25
a quote.


944
0:52:0,25 --> 0:52:2,99
And since he wasn't
just a little sexist,


945
0:52:2,99 --> 0:52:5,14
I've changed a few pronouns.


946
0:52:5,14 --> 0:52:7,21
We live in a different time now.


947
0:52:7,21 --> 0:52:11,96
He said, every day we
slaughter our finest impulses.


948
0:52:11,96 --> 0:52:13,75
That's why we get
a heartache when


949
0:52:13,75 --> 0:52:18,46
we read those lines written
by the hand of a master


950
0:52:18,46 --> 0:52:22,54
and recognize them as our own,
as the tender shoots which


951
0:52:22,54 --> 0:52:25,56
we stifled because
we lacked the faith


952
0:52:25,56 --> 0:52:29,56
to believe in our own powers
and our own criteria of truth


953
0:52:29,56 --> 0:52:30,71
and beauty.


954
0:52:30,71 --> 0:52:33,63
Every man and woman,
when she gets quiet


955
0:52:33,63 --> 0:52:37,7
and when she becomes
desperately honest with herself,


956
0:52:37,7 --> 0:52:41,94
is capable of uttering
profound truths.


957
0:52:41,94 --> 0:52:44,64
We all derive from
the same source.


958
0:52:44,64 --> 0:52:48,0
There's no mystery about
the origin of things.


959
0:52:48,0 --> 0:52:52,75
We are all part of creation,
all royalty, all poets,


960
0:52:52,75 --> 0:52:54,38
all musicians.


961
0:52:54,38 --> 0:52:58,642
We have only to open up and
discover what's in here.


962
0:52:58,642 --> 0:53:0,121
[APPLAUSE]


963
0:53:0,121 --> 0:53:4,57



964
0:53:4,57 --> 0:53:7,65
AUDIENCE: I want to revisit
some of what you shared,


965
0:53:7,65 --> 0:53:12,465
both at the end and about your
process in writing this book.


966
0:53:12,465 --> 0:53:15,84
And in particular--
so within Google


967
0:53:15,84 --> 0:53:17,6
we're a company
creating software


968
0:53:17,6 --> 0:53:21,34
that people are using,
even in particular around


969
0:53:21,34 --> 0:53:23,75
like authoring.


970
0:53:23,75 --> 0:53:25,487
So I'm curious, given
some of the things


971
0:53:25,487 --> 0:53:30,44
that you had highlighted about
sort a greater, like a greater


972
0:53:30,44 --> 0:53:35,34
connection to our humanity in
terms of how we use computers


973
0:53:35,34 --> 0:53:39,29
for expression, for authoring,
and some of the things that you


974
0:53:39,29 --> 0:53:43,182
had mentioned early on
around approaching the book


975
0:53:43,182 --> 0:53:45,64
and writing cinematically, and
a lot of the reflection that


976
0:53:45,64 --> 0:53:47,94
took place for you
around steering


977
0:53:47,94 --> 0:53:51,5
this kind of middle course
between extremes, I'm curious,


978
0:53:51,5 --> 0:53:53,52
do you see like ways
that tools could


979
0:53:53,52 --> 0:53:57,3
be improved to support the kind
of authoring-- to support you


980
0:53:57,3 --> 0:54:0,1
in the processes
you went through


981
0:54:0,1 --> 0:54:2,79
for like another
kind of expression?


982
0:54:2,79 --> 0:54:5,505
CHRISANN BRENNAN: I
feel-- this is out there--


983
0:54:5,505 --> 0:54:10,795
but I feel it needs to be bumped
up to a whole other level.


984
0:54:10,795 --> 0:54:14,31



985
0:54:14,31 --> 0:54:16,205
Now, is all this function.


986
0:54:16,205 --> 0:54:22,73



987
0:54:22,73 --> 0:54:24,33
I mean that's another
good question.


988
0:54:24,33 --> 0:54:26,371
And it's going to ring
through me because there's


989
0:54:26,371 --> 0:54:28,5
no way I can quite answer that.


990
0:54:28,5 --> 0:54:31,98
And also I'm tremendously
grateful for the tools that


991
0:54:31,98 --> 0:54:36,12
are because it was remarkable
what I was able to do.


992
0:54:36,12 --> 0:54:40,92
I don't have an idea--
my biggest idea is


993
0:54:40,92 --> 0:54:44,55
that the energetics
of the computer


994
0:54:44,55 --> 0:54:51,52
needs to be a higher frequency
so that it's not cutting off--


995
0:54:51,52 --> 0:54:54,662
OK, so this is what I think.


996
0:54:54,662 --> 0:54:59,37
I think the computer is cutting
people off from their hearts.


997
0:54:59,37 --> 0:55:2,44
I think it's cutting
them off from maybe


998
0:55:2,44 --> 0:55:5,709
even the reason they came here.


999
0:55:5,709 --> 0:55:7,75
If it's cutting off their
hearts and their hearts


1000
0:55:7,75 --> 0:55:11,72
have the reasons they came
here, like their own destiny.


1001
0:55:11,72 --> 0:55:20,12
So what I would like to see
just a gifted workforce who


1002
0:55:20,12 --> 0:55:24,6
can come in and who
know multiple levels


1003
0:55:24,6 --> 0:55:30,5
of possibilities and can
design consciousness.


1004
0:55:30,5 --> 0:55:31,2
It's weird.


1005
0:55:31,2 --> 0:55:34,29
Because I don't really want
computers to be babies,


1006
0:55:34,29 --> 0:55:36,13
like new life forms.


1007
0:55:36,13 --> 0:55:39,29
But still, I would
like the computers--


1008
0:55:39,29 --> 0:55:43,94
I know that there are
people-- and some of you


1009
0:55:43,94 --> 0:55:50,55
could easily, probably
have that in you.


1010
0:55:50,55 --> 0:55:52,57
It's a calling.


1011
0:55:52,57 --> 0:56:1,68
It's something that you're
not-- only by magic and accident


1012
0:56:1,68 --> 0:56:3,84
do you get trained for.


1013
0:56:3,84 --> 0:56:14,46
So in terms of the functionality
of how the computer can help


1014
0:56:14,46 --> 0:56:19,12
remarkable people be more
creative, I have no comment.


1015
0:56:19,12 --> 0:56:29,7
I feel like the design of the
machine itself needs to be-- I


1016
0:56:29,7 --> 0:56:30,66
don't even know
what words-- redone.


1017
0:56:30,66 --> 0:56:31,28
AUDIENCE: Maybe transformed.


1018
0:56:31,28 --> 0:56:32,52
CHRISANN BRENNAN: Yeah.


1019
0:56:32,52 --> 0:56:34,992
AUDIENCE: To pick up on some
of the themes you mentioned--


1020
0:56:34,992 --> 0:56:38,56
I mean I appreciated the analogy
you gave around like a cell


1021
0:56:38,56 --> 0:56:40,674
phone as the kind of
like modern cigarette.


1022
0:56:40,674 --> 0:56:42,9
When you're standing
in line, it's


1023
0:56:42,9 --> 0:56:44,205
a way to sort of pass the time.


1024
0:56:44,205 --> 0:56:45,58
CHRISANN BRENNAN:
Good, good one.


1025
0:56:45,58 --> 0:56:46,38
I should add that.


1026
0:56:46,38 --> 0:56:46,75
AUDIENCE: Yeah.


1027
0:56:46,75 --> 0:56:49,44
And it's somewhat ironic because
it's a device for communication


1028
0:56:49,44 --> 0:56:52,9
and we use it for like
disconnection, a disconnection


1029
0:56:52,9 --> 0:56:56,699
from ourselves, a disconnection
from the people around us.


1030
0:56:56,699 --> 0:56:58,24
In terms of some of
what you had just


1031
0:56:58,24 --> 0:57:1,582
been mentioning, the way that
computers and technology is


1032
0:57:1,582 --> 0:57:3,4
conceptualized
right now, it's very


1033
0:57:3,4 --> 0:57:5,6
much around kind of
spectacle and sort


1034
0:57:5,6 --> 0:57:8,74
of what we see,
seeing new things.


1035
0:57:8,74 --> 0:57:10,82
And it sounds like
I was hearing you


1036
0:57:10,82 --> 0:57:14,25
get at how there may be
possibilities around supporting


1037
0:57:14,25 --> 0:57:18,75
a kind of reflection
or introspection,


1038
0:57:18,75 --> 0:57:20,93
like arriving at insights
kind of internally.


1039
0:57:20,93 --> 0:57:23,114
I'm curious if that's
something that you're also


1040
0:57:23,114 --> 0:57:24,53
envisioning as a
possibility there


1041
0:57:24,53 --> 0:57:26,613
CHRISANN BRENNAN: Well,
it's an interesting thing.


1042
0:57:26,613 --> 0:57:30,5
I mean the furthest I've gone
with it is that people need


1043
0:57:30,5 --> 0:57:33,55
time to be reflective with
the human energy system.


1044
0:57:33,55 --> 0:57:36,83
It's already so much-- it's
light years ahead of anything


1045
0:57:36,83 --> 0:57:38,93
we can do with the computer.


1046
0:57:38,93 --> 0:57:42,19
So in terms of
using the computer,


1047
0:57:42,19 --> 0:57:43,51
I think it's a problem.


1048
0:57:43,51 --> 0:57:49,65



1049
0:57:49,65 --> 0:57:52,19
That's exactly where
the problem is--


1050
0:57:52,19 --> 0:57:53,4
AUDIENCE: Thank you.


1051
0:57:53,4 --> 0:57:54,248
CHRISANN BRENNAN: --eclipsed.


1052
0:57:54,248 --> 0:57:56,31
Yeah.


1053
0:57:56,31 --> 0:57:57,624
AUDIENCE: Thanks.


1054
0:57:57,624 --> 0:57:58,79
CHRISANN BRENNAN: Thank you.


1055
0:57:58,79 --> 0:57:59,716
AUDIENCE: Yeah.


1056
0:57:59,716 --> 0:58:1,496
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.


1057
0:58:1,496 --> 0:58:2,871
AUDIENCE: Thanks
for coming also.


1058
0:58:2,871 --> 0:58:4,755
CHRISANN BRENNAN: Thank you.


1059
0:58:4,755 --> 0:58:6,168
[APPLAUSE]


1060
0:58:6,168 --> 0:60:6,168
