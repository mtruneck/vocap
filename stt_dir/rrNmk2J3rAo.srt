1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:2,735
ROCCO CASTORO: So we bought
this E-Meter--


2
0:0:2,735 --> 0:0:6,55
it's a Mark VII, I believe.


3
0:0:6,55 --> 0:0:8,91
We got it just because you're
not supposed to have these


4
0:0:8,91 --> 0:0:13,52
unless you're a member of a
certain organization that's


5
0:0:13,52 --> 0:0:16,95
responsible for their creation,
courtesy of Hubbard


6
0:0:16,95 --> 0:0:18,64
Electrometer Manufacturing.


7
0:0:18,64 --> 0:0:20,56
I've always wanted one of these
just because they're


8
0:0:20,56 --> 0:0:21,53
kind of goofy.


9
0:0:21,53 --> 0:0:26,7
And they supposedly will tell
you certain information about


10
0:0:26,7 --> 0:0:28,89
your spiritual being.


11
0:0:28,89 --> 0:0:32,845
And if you've rid yourself of
past spiritual experiences


12
0:0:32,845 --> 0:0:37,49
that were negative, and how
whole of a person you are.


13
0:0:37,49 --> 0:0:45,77



14
0:0:45,77 --> 0:0:48,47
The Hubbard Electrometer, more
commonly known as the E-Meter,


15
0:0:48,47 --> 0:0:51,61
is a "religious artifact" used
to measure the state of


16
0:0:51,61 --> 0:0:53,68
electrical characteristics
in the static field


17
0:0:53,68 --> 0:0:55,55
surrounding the body.


18
0:0:55,55 --> 0:0:58,36
E-Meters operate in a similar
fashion to lie detectors.


19
0:0:58,36 --> 0:1:0,14
Relying on a type of electrical
circuit called a


20
0:1:0,14 --> 0:1:2,67
Wheatstone Bridge, which
measures the subject's


21
0:1:2,67 --> 0:1:4,56
galvanic skin response.


22
0:1:4,56 --> 0:1:7,47
In short, the device produces a
small electrical current and


23
0:1:7,47 --> 0:1:8,78
measures the subject's
electrical


24
0:1:8,78 --> 0:1:10,3
resistance to that current.


25
0:1:10,3 --> 0:1:15,795



26
0:1:15,795 --> 0:1:16,6
Wilbert?


27
0:1:16,6 --> 0:1:17,1
WILBERT: Yeah?


28
0:1:17,1 --> 0:1:17,91
ROCCO CASTORO: Please
come over and


29
0:1:17,91 --> 0:1:19,407
get an E-Meter reading.


30
0:1:19,407 --> 0:1:20,301
WILBERT: [INAUDIBLE].


31
0:1:20,301 --> 0:1:21,19
ROCCO CASTORO: Pick them
up again, take


32
0:1:21,19 --> 0:1:21,93
them off the table.


33
0:1:21,93 --> 0:1:24,75
OK, if it rises, the dial moves
to the left, that means


34
0:1:24,75 --> 0:1:27,95
that you're non-confrontational,
your fear


35
0:1:27,95 --> 0:1:29,4
or responsibility or


36
0:1:29,4 --> 0:1:31,85
identification is coming through.


37
0:1:31,85 --> 0:1:35,24
If it moves to the right, that
means you've got losses, lies,


38
0:1:35,24 --> 0:1:38,15
present time problems, and a
disagreement with reality.


39
0:1:38,15 --> 0:1:41,14
OK, so it moves to the right,
which it's doing, I think


40
0:1:41,14 --> 0:1:43,53
Wilbert's got a disagreement
with reality.


41
0:1:43,53 --> 0:1:46,17
Considering that Wilbert was
spiritually void, I decided


42
0:1:46,17 --> 0:1:48,19
that a wider group of test
subjects was needed.


43
0:1:48,19 --> 0:1:50,4
And headed out to Union Square,
where I told people


44
0:1:50,4 --> 0:1:51,875
whether or not they were
good individuals.


45
0:1:51,875 --> 0:1:56,306



46
0:1:56,306 --> 0:1:58,3
This is a sign we made
before we came.


47
0:1:58,3 --> 0:2:1,37
I just want to make sure people
know we're not "those"


48
0:2:1,37 --> 0:2:3,51
guys, if that makes sense.


49
0:2:3,51 --> 0:2:3,8
I'm winking.


50
0:2:3,8 --> 0:2:5,335
You can't see it under
my sunglasses.


51
0:2:5,335 --> 0:2:12,59



52
0:2:12,59 --> 0:2:15,73
Now, don't tell anyone, but
we've commandeered some public


53
0:2:15,73 --> 0:2:18,51
electricity from
the park here.


54
0:2:18,51 --> 0:2:21,28
We don't know if we're
going to get fined or


55
0:2:21,28 --> 0:2:22,58
arrested for that.


56
0:2:22,58 --> 0:2:27,5
Hopefully we at least get a few
meter readings beforehand.


57
0:2:27,5 --> 0:2:29,49
Ladies, would you be liking
a free E-Meter reading?


58
0:2:29,49 --> 0:2:31,19
Would you like to have a
free E-Meter reading?


59
0:2:31,19 --> 0:2:32,8
Ma'am, would you like a
free E-Meter reading?


60
0:2:32,8 --> 0:2:34,33
Come get your E-Meter
readings.


61
0:2:34,33 --> 0:2:37,77
E-Meter readings right here.


62
0:2:37,77 --> 0:2:39,32
This is so fucking silly.


63
0:2:39,32 --> 0:2:40,96
Get your E-Meter readings!


64
0:2:40,96 --> 0:2:41,18
Hi.


65
0:2:41,18 --> 0:2:41,615
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hi.


66
0:2:41,615 --> 0:2:43,902
ROCCO CASTORO: Are you
interested in E-Meters?


67
0:2:43,902 --> 0:2:48,14
You're just going to grip these
as so, very lightly.


68
0:2:48,14 --> 0:2:50,51
Oh, wow.


69
0:2:50,51 --> 0:2:52,5
You got some energy.


70
0:2:52,5 --> 0:2:55,86
If you could transport to a time
period, any time period


71
0:2:55,86 --> 0:2:57,36
throughout history, and off
the top of your head, what


72
0:2:57,36 --> 0:2:57,61
would it be?


73
0:2:57,61 --> 0:2:58,12
FEMALE SPEAKER: Harlem
Renaissance.


74
0:2:58,12 --> 0:2:59,575
MALE SPEAKER: 1930.


75
0:2:59,575 --> 0:3:1,1
ROCCO CASTORO: So dinosaurs,
you said?


76
0:3:1,1 --> 0:3:1,945
FEMALE SPEAKER: Dinosaurs,
yeah.


77
0:3:1,945 --> 0:3:2,29
ROCCO CASTORO: OK.


78
0:3:2,29 --> 0:3:3,38
MALE SPEAKER: I'd
have said 1950.


79
0:3:3,38 --> 0:3:6,4
ROCCO CASTORO: Why 1950?


80
0:3:6,4 --> 0:3:9,29
MALE SPEAKER: Well, I
guess I like retro.


81
0:3:9,29 --> 0:3:13,39
I've developed more of a sense
for vintage things since I've


82
0:3:13,39 --> 0:3:14,83
seen all these hipsters.


83
0:3:14,83 --> 0:3:16,54
ROCCO CASTORO: Is that right?


84
0:3:16,54 --> 0:3:17,935
From antiquity, basically.


85
0:3:17,935 --> 0:3:18,75
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


86
0:3:18,75 --> 0:3:19,575
And it just feels familiar.


87
0:3:19,575 --> 0:3:21,18
ROCCO CASTORO: Do you feel
like you might have been


88
0:3:21,18 --> 0:3:22,94
around during that time
in a past life?


89
0:3:22,94 --> 0:3:23,29
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, yeah.


90
0:3:23,29 --> 0:3:23,76
ROCCO CASTORO: Yeah?


91
0:3:23,76 --> 0:3:26,67
Do you have any inclination of
what you might have done?


92
0:3:26,67 --> 0:3:27,72
And you're falling right now.


93
0:3:27,72 --> 0:3:30,98
So it looks like if you were, it
was a traumatic experience


94
0:3:30,98 --> 0:3:31,62
of some sort.


95
0:3:31,62 --> 0:3:34,32
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah, there
was, but I don't


96
0:3:34,32 --> 0:3:35,11
want to get into it.


97
0:3:35,11 --> 0:3:36,44
ROCCO CASTORO: It
was bad though?


98
0:3:36,44 --> 0:3:36,89
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


99
0:3:36,89 --> 0:3:38,64
ROCCO CASTORO: Do you think that
whatever happened to you


100
0:3:38,64 --> 0:3:43,11
then that was a negative
experience has impeded you in


101
0:3:43,11 --> 0:3:44,56
this life in some way?


102
0:3:44,56 --> 0:3:46,49
FEMALE SPEAKER: Has it affected
decisions I've made


103
0:3:46,49 --> 0:3:47,2
in this lifetime?


104
0:3:47,2 --> 0:3:47,38
Yes.


105
0:3:47,38 --> 0:3:48,495
The answer is yes.


106
0:3:48,495 --> 0:3:50,9
FEMALE SPEAKER: I thought maybe
these rings were messing


107
0:3:50,9 --> 0:3:52,7
it up because you
got me nervous.


108
0:3:52,7 --> 0:3:53,6
ROCCO CASTORO: Well, you're not
supposed to have rings on.


109
0:3:53,6 --> 0:3:55,98
But this whole thing's complete
bullshit anyway, so


110
0:3:55,98 --> 0:3:56,14
it doesn't matter.


111
0:3:56,14 --> 0:3:57,365
Like what's your
favorite color?


112
0:3:57,365 --> 0:3:58,4
MALE SPEAKER Red.


113
0:3:58,4 --> 0:3:59,65
ROCCO CASTORO: OK.


114
0:3:59,65 --> 0:4:2,355
It's dropping, so that kind of
means you might be lying.


115
0:4:2,355 --> 0:4:3,19
What's your name?


116
0:4:3,19 --> 0:4:3,925
ALZEENA: Alzeena.


117
0:4:3,925 --> 0:4:5,5
ROCCO CASTORO: Alzeena, OK.


118
0:4:5,5 --> 0:4:7,62
And it looks like you're kind
of lying about that.


119
0:4:7,62 --> 0:4:8,44
Are you sure that's your name?


120
0:4:8,44 --> 0:4:12,1
ALZEENA: This might be some BS,
because that is my name.


121
0:4:12,1 --> 0:4:12,64
ROCCO CASTORO: OK.


122
0:4:12,64 --> 0:4:14,822
So that does show you're
a good person.


123
0:4:14,822 --> 0:4:16,444
FEMALE SPEAKER: Glad
to hear that.


124
0:4:16,444 --> 0:4:17,35
Not that I needed proof.


125
0:4:17,35 --> 0:4:19,899
ROCCO CASTORO: No, you didn't.


126
0:4:19,899 --> 0:4:22,49
But apparently certain
people believe that


127
0:4:22,49 --> 0:4:23,52
this is proof of that.


128
0:4:23,52 --> 0:4:25,482
So I'm not sure what
to say about that.


129
0:4:25,482 --> 0:4:26,246
FEMALE SPEAKER: Good for them.


130
0:4:26,246 --> 0:4:26,9
ROCCO CASTORO: Good
for them, right?


131
0:4:26,9 --> 0:4:27,26
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


132
0:4:27,26 --> 0:4:28,605
MALE SPEAKER: So now,
am I a good person?


133
0:4:28,605 --> 0:4:30,11
ROCCO CASTORO: You're at 2.56.


134
0:4:30,11 --> 0:4:32,71
So would you consider yourself
a good person?


135
0:4:32,71 --> 0:4:33,16
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes, I do.


136
0:4:33,16 --> 0:4:34,226
ROCCO CASTORO: You do?


137
0:4:34,226 --> 0:4:36,1
FEMALE SPEAKER: Falling.


138
0:4:36,1 --> 0:4:38,8
ROCCO CASTORO: It is falling.


139
0:4:38,8 --> 0:4:39,505
Would you consider yourself
a good person?


140
0:4:39,505 --> 0:4:40,9
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.


141
0:4:40,9 --> 0:4:43,61
ROCCO CASTORO: Let's say
somebody beats up your mom or


142
0:4:43,61 --> 0:4:44,14
your sister.


143
0:4:44,14 --> 0:4:47,23
You have a chance to send the
guy to jail, or you can kick


144
0:4:47,23 --> 0:4:48,93
the shit out of him
for an hour and


145
0:4:48,93 --> 0:4:49,85
then send him to jail.


146
0:4:49,85 --> 0:4:50,73
Which would you rather do?


147
0:4:50,73 --> 0:4:52,462
MALE SPEAKER: I'll
send him to jail.


148
0:4:52,462 --> 0:4:53,68
ROCCO CASTORO: Oh, look!


149
0:4:53,68 --> 0:4:54,82
He's fucking lying!


150
0:4:54,82 --> 0:4:56,116
MALE SPEAKER: Nice.


151
0:4:56,116 --> 0:4:58,16
ROCCO CASTORO: I think
we've got a good fix


152
0:4:58,16 --> 0:4:59,88
on your moral character.


153
0:4:59,88 --> 0:5:2,43
The majority of the subjects I
tested seemed to believe my


154
0:5:2,43 --> 0:5:4,81
E-Meter readings wholeheartedly,
which makes me


155
0:5:4,81 --> 0:5:7,85
think that true auditors
are full of shit.


156
0:5:7,85 --> 0:5:10,184
So, oh wow, you're
really just--


157
0:5:10,184 --> 0:5:11,66
FEMALE SPEAKER: What
does that mean?


158
0:5:11,66 --> 0:5:11,93
Is that bad?


159
0:5:11,93 --> 0:5:13,37
ROCCO CASTORO: It's
kind of bad.


160
0:5:13,37 --> 0:5:14,22
FEMALE SPEAKER: So what
does that mean?


161
0:5:14,22 --> 0:5:14,955
ROCCO CASTORO: I don't know.


162
0:5:14,955 --> 0:5:16,42
FEMALE SPEAKER: What do you
mean you don't know?


163
0:5:16,42 --> 0:5:16,93
ROCCO CASTORO: I don't know
what any of this means.


164
0:5:16,93 --> 0:5:18,38
I'm just making it
up, kind of.


165
0:5:18,38 --> 0:5:19,46
How old are you?


166
0:5:19,46 --> 0:5:19,72
FEMALE SPEAKER: 30.


167
0:5:19,72 --> 0:5:20,845
ROCCO CASTORO: 30, OK.


168
0:5:20,845 --> 0:5:22,57
Oh, you're telling the truth.


169
0:5:22,57 --> 0:5:23,29
Oh, maybe not.


170
0:5:23,29 --> 0:5:25,16
Maybe something bad
happened to you.


171
0:5:25,16 --> 0:5:26,27
FEMALE SPEAKER: I was probably
a heroin addict.


172
0:5:26,27 --> 0:5:28,725
ROCCO CASTORO: It seems like
you're pretty at peace with


173
0:5:28,725 --> 0:5:32,14
yourself, and there are
no evil engrams eating


174
0:5:32,14 --> 0:5:33,16
away at your soul.


175
0:5:33,16 --> 0:5:33,56
FEMALE SPEAKER: Really?


176
0:5:33,56 --> 0:5:33,91
ROCCO CASTORO: Yeah.


177
0:5:33,91 --> 0:5:34,26
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh.


178
0:5:34,26 --> 0:5:35,7
So I would have thought
the opposite.


179
0:5:35,7 --> 0:7:35,7
