###27 'Don't screw this up. No screw-ups. Got to impress! '
###31 So Mr Corrigan, we've examined your loan application and I have one question.
###37 Are you a pathetic, worthless punk?
###40 Er, well, no.
###41 Right. Because I'm going to turn you down as if you were a hippy parasite.
###46 'Oh, yes. Yeah, I like it. '
###49 Then I'll make you feel like a turkey fucker.
###52 Why? Because I'm the big man and you're a shit heel, right?
###56 'Brilliant. That is just so spot on. '
###60 Or... I could treat Mr Corrigan like a valued and respected customer
###65 and we'd both end up winners.
###67 - Isn't that right, Mr Corrigan? - Right. Absolutely!
###71 - Dead right. - 'Alan Johnson, I'm in love.
###76 'I'm in love with you, Johnson. '
###78 'There are two basic energies in the world.
###81 'Stress and relaxation. '
###83 Super Hans...
###86 - What are we doing? - We...
###88 are looking through the other end of the telescope.
###93 I don't feel very well.
###95 - Did something bad happen? - Everything's OK.
###98 There's two basic energies in the world - stress and relaxation.
###102 - Did I break through? - You passed out after the love beans.
###106 I thought the table was being ironic.
###110 But what was the bad thing?
###113 'Floss is boss. Floss is boss. '
###115 - Floss is boss! - 'No, not that.
###119 'Something worse. '
###120 - What happened? - That will probably become clear later.
###124 Like the French Revolution.
###127 - I think we need to tidy up. - Absolutely not.
###130 That is the one thing I stand against. A thousand times, no.
###136 Hi! Come in, come in.
###138 - Hi, guys. - Hiya, Soph.
###140 - How's it going? - Oh, good, thanks.
###143 'Ask her to go to the bar. Ask her! '
###145 We're just watching a bit of Morse. Care to join us?
###148 I don't think right now. Er, Mark...
###151 - I just wanted to say about the lift. - 8:15 sharp?
###154 Yeah. I forgot about Debbie's wheelchair.
###157 - Yeah? - I think it'll take quite a bit of room.
###160 - Right, well, that... - Dave's helping her so I said to him...
###164 I mean, I could... help.
###166 Yeah... Yeah, sure. It's just Dave's been, you know...
###171 Oh, yeah. Totally. Absolutely.
###174 'Dave's the saint. Nothing must unseat Dave. '
###177 I'm really sorry. I'm sure you'll be able to get another lift or a train.
###182 - Honestly, it's fine. - Sorry.
###184 Thanks. Well, see ya.
###186 Bye.
###188 - Night. - OK, night.
###195 'Yes, I know what you're thinking.
###197 'I'm shit, you're great. I'm the worm, you're the king.
###200 'Eat your nuts and go fuck yourself. '
###207 'Oh, I feel like loam, a piece of loam. Jesus, what am I talking about?
###212 'I wish Mark was here. No more drugs. I don't need drugs.
###217 'I mean, what great music was ever made on drugs?
###220 'Bowie, obviously. The Floyd, the Prodge, Aphex - the list is endless really.
###225 'But they could have done it twice as fast with half the mess if they just...
###230 'Ah, was that the bad thing?
###239 'Not that. Something wronger.
###241 'Mark'll be so pleased when he sees this. He's just so...
###244 'Maybe I could open my bank statements.
###247 'Maybe you can be boring and cool. '
###250 'I only asked about the bus. I'm not a freak.
###253 'Checking into the hotel, it's all, "And can we get you fresh whatever?"
###258 'Once you're leaving, it's, "Well, one of you is liable for the cashews. " Sophie...
###264 'Jeff?!
###265 'That fucking... Oh!
###268 'What's the story there?!
###270 'This is the worst thing to happen to anyone ever. Oh, my fucking life.
###274 - 'It's Alan Johnson. ' - Mark! It is Mark, isn't it?
###278 - Yes, it is. It's Mark. - So?
###281 - Do you want a lift or what? - I would love a lift.
###284 'Shit! This is the best thing to happen to anyone ever. '
###288 ?... moonlight Dancing in the moon...?
###292 'Look at me. Friends with a big black businessman
###295 'like it's the most natural thing in the world.
###298 'Lf he got accused of a crime he hadn't committed, I could come to his aid and... '
###304 - Jez? - Hey, you're back! This is great.
###307 - You're really back. - Er, yes.
###308 The El Dude Brothers are back in town. Aaaggh! Aaaggh!
###313 Uhhhh. Uhhhh.
###315 Come on in. Sit down. Tell me all about your trip. I want to hear everything -
###320 all the gory details.
###322 Did you bring back any little tiny soaps?
###326 - Jez, are you all right? - Course I am. Now you're back.
###329 Right. That's very nice and everything, Jez, but I should open some wine.
###334 - Rather a good friend is coming over. - Wine?
###338 Friend?
###339 But you haven't got a friend. Who's your friend?
###343 Phoney Tony, I call him.
###345 This government is all spin, it's smoke and mirrors.
###348 I totally agree. I couldn't agree more.
###351 - The way he licks Bush's arse. - Pathetic!
###354 They're spending more on schools but where's the evidence?
###358 What schools? Where? Where the heck are they? Can you see them?
###363 'This is good. Yeah, three guys sitting around, shooting the shit.
###368 'Politics doesn't have to be boring. A lot of Moby's stuff is political, I think. '
###373 Yeah, it's all lies, isn't it?
###376 Don't tell me that Blair wears a suit when he's at home watching Big Brother.
###381 - 'God. Not in front of Johnson. ' - How do you mean exactly?
###385 They should be more honest.
###387 At least, Tony Adams from the IRA,
###390 he's like, "Yeah, I shoot people. I like shooting people. "
###394 If they were more honest,
###395 maybe people wouldn't switch straight over when the news comes on.
###400 You turn over when the news comes on?
###402 No, no. No, sometimes...
###405 maybe for a treat, but generally, it's great.
###408 Who do you support? I mean, Mark likes Israel, I'm Palestine.
###412 Makes it more interesting when you pick a...
###415 No?
###417 So I'll show you what I've done so far on the book.
###421 - The book? - Business Secrets Of The Pharaohs.
###424 It's only chapter one, but it gives a flavour...
###427 'Oh, my God. The bad thing.
###430 'That's the bad thing! '
###433 Make a tsunami!
###436 Can I have a look?
###438 It doesn't seem to...
###440 Oh! Oh, dear.
###442 Look what you've... Oh, is it all right?
###445 - Well, no, but it wasn't working when... - Oh, yes, it was.
###449 It was working fine and then you spilt your drink on it. That's what happened.
###454 That's what I saw.
###457 'Me and Johnson. We only met a fortnight ago.
###461 'Everything's happening so fast. ' That sounds... That sounds just...
###465 - amazing. - Excellent. Second.
###471 Yeah, but the relocation thing, moving out on Jeremy,
###474 - it feels a bit weird, Dad. - 'Shit! '
###477 - Sorry? - It feels weird, daddio.
###480 - 'Good save. ' - Why, daddio? Third.
###483 Well, nowadays, email and so forth, do I really need to move to Cardiff?
###489 Let me tell you a story. It's about two mountain climbers.
###493 One's climbing. The other one is injured, weak, clinging to the first guy's leg.
###499 - Uh-huh. Interesting. - The first guy has a choice.
###502 Let his pal cling on and they're both yak food or...
###506 shake him off and make it to the top -
###509 solo.
###511 'I've got to tell him. How am I going to tell him?
###515 'Oh, this is horrible. He might crumble.
###518 'He's weak. Remember the Johnson. '
###521 - Hey, Jez! - Hey.
###523 So, what do you make of this place? You choose what you want.
###527 'This could be good. Just like the old days. Don't slag off Johnson yet. '
###532 Johnson told me about it. According to Johnson, wasabi sauce is...
###536 Oh, Johnson says, Johnson says!
###538 If you love Johnson that much, why don't you marry him?
###542 Where did this come from all of a sudden?
###545 Why don't you actually screw him, since you clearly want to so much?
###549 Jeremy!
###551 I've got nothing against being gay but I'm not and neither is Johnson.
###555 He's black, which I expect you've noticed.
###558 So just because he's black, I have to like him.
###561 Do I? That's political correctness gone mad. Look, Mark, I'm sorry...
###566 'Jesus, I'm just the sort of person who'd be gay and repressive to himself. '
###572 The thing is, well...
###575 There's no easy way to put this but... Johnson's invited me in with him.
###580 He wants me to get into bed, team up with him.
###583 - It would mean relocating to Cardiff. - You're kidding?
###587 Look, I really feel I need to go for this, Jez.
###591 Look, it's not as if it's the end... for us.
###594 We're still the El Dude Brothers. We always will be. It's just...
###598 I'm leaving.
###600 I can't spend my life with you at base camp.
###603 OK, OK...
###605 That's fine. I'm fine with that.
###609 Good.
###611 'If I keep smiling, maybe he won't leave. '
###617 This is a pretty cool place, isn't it?
###619 Chopsticks.
###622 Hmm, these are a bit long for me actually.
###626 'He's cracked. I hope he doesn't do anything drastic. '
###629 That's better. So tell me all about the wasabi sauce.
###633 'If he hangs himself,
###635 'I could put an orange in his mouth and say it was a fatal wanking accident. '
###641 I'm so glad you came here for a follow-up, man.
###644 You totally blew apart Barbara's whole stone-age business paradigm.
###649 Like taking candy from a baby.
###651 'Maybe I do fancy him. He's handsome.
###654 'Not in a gay way. It's just obvious. He's a good-looking guy - a guy's guy.
###660 - 'But would I...? ' - Hey, Mark.
###662 Sophie!
###664 Sophie, Sophie, Sophie! You know Alan, of course.
###667 Yeah, quite a seminar. Barbara went home crying.
###670 I'm just a doctor. I didn't make the needles sharp.
###673 It's not a wig, Alan. That's actually her hair.
###676 You've got to admit, she was asking a lot of questions.
###679 - Thought you big kahunas should know. - Yeah, whatever.
###683 See you.
###686 Jesus, some people!
###688 You point them to a lift and they're like, "No, I'll take the stairs. "
###693 'I do want to be with him but could I think about kissing?
###697 'Well, I'm thinking about it.
###699 'No, I'm just thinking about thinking about it. '
###702 Yeah, she's very...
###704 Yeah... I could have a little thing going there with Sophie actually.
###709 - Well, my advice is keep it little. - Yeah?
###712 Women? Does a balance sheet ever cry and say it needs time to think?
###717 Business doesn't say it loves you then runs off with a buddy.
###721 Take a look at her, mate. Take a good, hard look at her.
###725 What do you see? What do you see in her,
###728 compared to, say, a supermodel like Giselle?
###731 She's...
###733 I think she's... very pretty.
###736 Come on, look at her arse.
###739 Is that the best arse you're ever going to get? Do you stick on that arse?
###744 She's got a fat arse.
###747 - Say it. - Well, she's...
###749 Maybe it is a bit...
###751 nice, but in a sense...
###753 If we're gonna do this, it's just you and me.
###756 No stress-buster mini-breaks, no women.
###759 Just us, a pile of Chinese food and some fuck-off spreadsheets.
###763 'Oh, yes, take me, Johnson. I'm yours! '
###770 Yeah, Jeremy and Super Hans.
###772 This is perfect because I'm being evicted soon.
###775 We are gonna have parties in this place that go beyond fun
###779 and actually get really, really nasty.
###782 When's the Iron Duke moving out?
###784 Erm, I dunno. Maybe a few weeks.
###787 - Nothing's really decided yet. - As a fuck-off present, let's spike him.
###792 Yeah... or maybe get him a nice watch or...
###795 He'll be like, "Can't make the meeting, boss.
###798 "I've gotta fax my soul off to God for an upgrade. "
###802 'It could be all right. Mark can make us a cleaning rota.
###806 'We'll just stick religiously to the rota. '
###811 'There's probably much less to worry about with gay sex.
###814 'You know where you are with a cock.
###817 'Still, even if I am gay, Johnson isn't.
###820 'It'll be hard enough turning me gay, let alone... '
###823 - Hiya, Mark. - 'OK, listen to the Johnson. '
###826 - Huh. - 'Yes, take that. '
###828 - How are you? - Oh, you know...
###830 'Stay strong, brother. '
###832 I've been meaning to say, about the other day, back from the hotel...
###837 - Didn't phase me, sweetheart. - 'That's a bit too much. '
###841 Yeah. Because, in the end, Dave had to go early.
###844 Then I knocked on your door and Jess said you'd gone.
###847 So that's what happened, in case you were wondering.
###851 - Whatever. - 'That's all very possible. '
###856 - Are you OK? You weren't pissed off? - 'Don't weaken. '
###860 - No, no. Why? - You seem a bit...
###862 I dunno. I hope everything's still, with us, yeah, all right.
###866 'This is ridiculous. She's beautiful. I'm not gay. Forget Johnson. Go for it! '
###873 Oh, Mark!
###874 - Are you all right? - Fine.
###876 No, it's fine...
###878 Just... nothing. A bump.
###880 'It's staring you in the face, Mark. There's only one other sex to try. '
###885 'Good old, unfriendly Mr Patel.
###888 'Never says a word, whether you're buying cornflakes, fabric softener
###893 'or gay porn.
###896 'So here we go. Watch without prejudice.
###899 'I'm just testing the water. I'm a sexual scientist.
###904 'So, OK, I'm keeping in trim.
###907 'This is fine. Typical evening in.
###909 'Johnson's doing the spreadsheet. There's nothing to be afraid of.
###914 'The Romans liked it and they got a lot done.
###916 'How's it going, Johnson? Ha-ha!
###919 'So quick?!
###921 'Yeah, some good kissing.
###923 'Maybe I'm bi-curious. What if that actually was Johnson?
###927 'Would that make me hotter?
###929 'What if he had Sophie's face or Sophie's body with Johnson's face?
###934 'Mum, Dad, I'm bi-curious. Yeah, right, the bum.
###937 'Nothing wrong with a bum...
###941 'Ah, that's a little too rich for me. I just don't know! '
###951 Do you think he really wondered, Sting, if the Russians loved their children too?
###956 No, it's a rhetorical question.
###959 Like Can You Feel The Force? Or Do They Know It's Christmas?
###963 I'm not so sure. He really seems to be sincerely hoping
###966 that the Russians love their children too, which I think is a little bit patronising.
###972 I really need to pick up my laptop from the IT guy before Johnson gets here.
###978 I could... drive you.
###981 - What? - Well, he gave you the keys.
###983 No, he forgot the keys after the pub.
###986 Then he called to put me in charge of the keys until he reclaims the keys.
###990 It's probably an initiative test. Will you... walk like some kind of stupid duck
###996 or will you drive like...
###998 Clarkson?
###1000 What if something happened?
###1002 Oh, right, suddenly I'm going to drive off the non-existent quayside.
###1007 I'm insured on my mum's insurance to drive any car.
###1010 It's freezing out there. Johnson won't mind, if he's a real mate.
###1015 - You're insured on any car? - Yes!
###1018 'Probably. '
###1023 'Who's the Johnson now, huh? Who's the Johnson now, Johnson? '
###1028 Shall we... open her up a bit?
###1030 No, absolutely not! We're almost at the office now.
###1033 If it feels good, do it. Isn't that Johnson's philosophy?
###1037 No.
###1039 They love it really.
###1041 God, Jeremy, no! That was Mica from... I hope they didn't recognise me.
###1046 What do you two do in the car then? Sit and talk about the VAT on cigarillos?
###1052 Of course not! Sometimes he lets me do the gears.
###1056 Hey, I've got an idea...
###1060 This doesn't feel right.
###1063 - This is so right. - But I can't drive.
###1065 Yes, you can. All you have to do is believe. Driving is bullshit.
###1072 Oh
###1073 my
###1074 God.
###1075 Just very slowly take your foot off the clutch
###1078 and just tickle the accelerator, OK?
###1081 OK.
###1083 OK...
###1084 OK.
###1086 Look at me go! I'm driving!
###1089 Look at me driving, Jez!
###1091 - You're driving. Very slowly in first gear. - Yeah.
###1094 Yeah, come on. I'm driving. I'm Johnson. Driving is bullshit! I'm Johnson!
###1100 That's right. It's easy.
###1102 Now, just give it a bit more juice and hang a right.
###1106 Right is bollocks. I'm going rogue.
###1108 - Hey, isn't that Sophie? - Jesus.
###1110 Yeah, h-how do I... How do I do stopping?
###1114 The pedal. No, the middle one!
###1121 - Blimey, Mark, when did you...? - What? This old banger?
###1125 It's not, is it? It's a brand-new Beamer.
###1127 And you'd probably like a spin, but we're just tooling around town.
###1132 It's a guy thing.
###1134 - Right. - You sure you're all right to...?
###1136 It's cool, Jez.
###1138 See you around, Soph.
###1143 Oh, Jesus...
###1148 Wow.
###1150 Alan Johnson's Beamer.
###1154 Alan... Johnson's...
###1156 Beamer.
###1158 Do you think he's going to mind?
###1160 I think it's possible he might mind.
###1163 If Mark can't drive, why did he...?
###1172 - You've got to help me out here. - Sure, mate. Sure.
###1175 I'll tell Super Hans that you'll be staying now.
###1179 Look, Jez, you've got to take the rap.
###1181 I mean, you don't have to, but...
###1184 I have a future
###1185 whereas you... not don't,
###1188 - just, it's different... - 'He's grasping at straws.
###1192 'It's all over for him and Johnson.
###1194 'Might as well get some brownie points by acting "the big friend".'
###1198 Sure, mate. If you really, really want me to... mate,
###1202 I'll do it. I'II...
###1204 face the firing squad.
###1206 - True mates. - True mates.
###1209 - Ehhh... - Uhhh...
###1214 Johnson is here! Johnson is here!
###1216 You're such a good guy.
###1220 'We'll be in Cardiff within the fortnight.
###1223 'Relax, Mark.
###1225 - 'Business before pleasure. ' - Mark, I'm a little concerned.
###1230 - My 5 Series isn't where I left it. - Alan, come in.
###1239 Something terrible has happened.
###1241 - What's happened to my car? - Yes, there's a bit of a problem there...
###1246 You see, I borrowed the keys, drove it around for a bit of a laugh
###1251 - and then I crashed it. - He says "borrowed", but I had no...
###1256 - Blimey. - Yes, "blimey".
###1259 Hey-ho. So, you got the Newport projections?
###1262 What? Hold on. Aren't you...?
###1264 The car. You trusted... You gave the keys to...
###1267 What? I'm insured out of my arse, mate. I'm covered.
###1271 So, sushi or cappuccino? I'm easy.
###1273 'Shit, he doesn't care.
###1275 'Mark's in the clear. It's going to be me and Super Hans - forever. '
###1280 No, don't go, because...
###1282 Sorry, Mark. I just can't take any more lies. He smashed up your car.
###1286 He did it because he hates you, really.
###1290 You really are a bitter loser, aren't you,
###1293 Mr No Logo, Mr Work A Day For World Peace?
###1296 - Mark, shall we split? - But you two...
###1299 This is never gonna work! You don't know him.
###1302 You don't know how he likes his toast.
###1305 In a business class seat of a Virgin Atlantic flight to New York.
###1309 Wrong! He likes one brown with Marmite and one white with lime marmalade.
###1314 - I'm so outta here. - No, don't go. You can't because...
###1317 The truth is he doesn't love you for your business plan.
###1321 He loves you for your...
###1325 - He loves you for you. - Jeremy, for God's sake!
###1328 Mark's gay, Johnson. I can handle that. I'm fine with that. Are you?
###1333 Look... I'm a businessman.
###1335 That's what I am. That's what I do.
###1339 I don't want... this.
###1341 I didn't come here for this. Mark, you don't...
###1344 - love me do you? - Love you?!
###1346 Of course not!
###1348 No...
###1351 Yes... yes, maybe a bit. I do possibly somewhat.
###1354 But... Alan, it's not how it seems.
###1358 I'm 850/0 sure I'm straight.
###1361 It's just... I do have feelings for you and, in principle, I'm not against...
###1367 more...
###1369 I don't think I'll know until it's right in front of me,
###1372 whether I'll be able to go through with it, OK?
###1375 You love me, not the business?
###1378 I just don't know any more!
###1385 I think it's best if you go now.
###1387 Yeah.
###1389 'My name's Andrew. I'm 25 years old. I'm a chef. '
###1393 'Not this. I don't want this. Not now.
###1396 'I'm not gay. Possibly bi, but basically uncurious. '
###1400 'I love beauty, hate arrogance and I love sucking cock. '
###1406 The bad thing...
###1408 That... was the bad thing.
###1418 Right, my turn now.
###1422 ? Don't know why
###1424 ? You're so blue
###1428 ? The sun's gonna shine on everything you do
###1432 ? And the sky
###1435 ? Is so blue
###1439 ? The sun's gonna shine on everything you do?
