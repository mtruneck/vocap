###12 Jeff Bushaw: For the Yellowstone Super Volcano.
###14 Steve Vanasse: Civil unrest following a

###28 Kat Perez: Thomas, don't give 'em the gun!
###29 Don't give 'em the gun, Thomas!
###31 No!
###32 <i> Narrator: Next, we go  inside the lives of</i>
###34 <i> two committed preppers.</i>
###36 <i> Who have devised  extensive plans.</i>
###38 Derek Price: Bulletproof, bombproof.
###40 <i> Narrator: Gone to  great lengths and</i>
###44 <i> made huge personal  sacrifices to</i>
###46 <i> ensure their  very survival.</i>
###48 Derek Price: This is a bad idea, probably.
###51 Boo-yah!
###52 <i> Narrator: The experts  will assess their preps,</i>
###54 <i> to see if they  have what it takes.</i>
###56 Brent: Are we ready?
###57 Haven Price: If the apocalypse comes
###58 we'll be safe and you won't.
###62 <i> Narrator: To survive.</i>
###63 Brent: Let's go.
###64 Let's go.
###65 People are hungry.
###66 Derek Price: You're dead.
###67 <i> Narrator: This is  Doomsday Preppers.</i>
###80 <i> Brent is a  jack-of-all-trades</i>
###82 <i> living on the east  coast of Florida.</i>
###84 <i> Over the course  of his life,</i>
###86 <i> he's been an engineer,  a real estate broker,</i>
###88 <i> and a military officer.</i>
###91 <i> Lately, he's been  bringing all his various</i>
###93 <i> skills together to  create his legacy.</i>
###96 <i> One final project  that he wants to leave</i>
###99 <i> behind for his children  and grandchildren.</i>
###102 Brent: This is going to be something that
###104 should last for generation upon generation.
###106 And maybe someday a hundred years from now
###109 or a thousand years from now,
###111 someone will come up this road and say,
###114 "How did this all happen?
###116 What was the man thinking?"
###117 <i> Narrator: What  Brent's thinking is:</i>
###119 <i> his family needs  a last bastion of</i>
###121 <i> defense against  a world gone mad.</i>
###127 <i> A stronghold to stand  against the end of times.</i>
###132 <i> Forget bunkers, if  the apocalypse comes,</i>
###137 <i> Brent's going  medieval on it.</i>
###144 <i> Welcome to Brent's  Doomsday Castle.</i>
###148 Brent: I'm preparing for an electromagnetic pulse.
###156 This is the heart of the castle, uh, over
###158 6,000 square feet, two floors.
###161 Six bedrooms will fill this,
###163 the upper two levels.
###164 This will be the main hall where everybody
###166 will be gathering.
###167 We could put half a cow out here.
###169 It'll be a feast just like the old medieval times.
###173 This will be the library.
###175 Solid mahogany shelving, 10 feet high.
###178 A spiral staircase going up almost three stories,
###181 up to the roof.
###182 In addition to everything that you see on top,
###185 we've got almost 3,000 square feet of bunker
###188 that can handle anything.
###190 Sometimes people will ask me,
###191 "How much money have you put in to this?"
###193 I'm probably approaching close
###195 to a million dollars.
###197 But I built a castle because
###198 castles are all rock.
###201 It can't burn.
###202 It would probably withstand most major
###204 earthquakes or any other catastrophe.
###207 <i> Narrator: But the  disaster scenario</i>
###209 <i> Brent fears  most is an EMP,</i>
###211 <i> an electromagnetic pulse,</i>
###213 <i> a burst of energy that can  fry electrical circuits.</i>
###218 <i> And that can be set  off by the explosion of</i>
###220 <i> atomic bombs  in the atmosphere.</i>
###224 Brent: We have so many enemies out there,
###227 both religious and non-religious that
###230 are out to do America in, in some way.
###234 Many countries have the ability to get
###237 a small atomic bomb 25 to 200 miles
###240 up into the atmosphere.
###242 <i> Narrator: A nuclear  blast large enough and</i>
###243 <i> high enough over  Kansas would cause an EMP</i>
###246 <i> that could affect the  entire Continental U.S.</i>
###249 <i> Brent fears such  a blast could black out</i>
###251 <i> the entire U.S.,  perhaps forever.</i>
###255 Brent: It's gonna take anything that has a
###257 computer chip, which almost everything
###259 is run by that.
###260 There would be no way to communicate with people.
###263 There is no water;
###264 there's no sanitation.
###265 It will be only a matter of days until people
###268 realize that they can't get any food.
###271 Then everyone will turn into basically a savage.
###276 We would go back to the medieval days.
###279 My fear was: with the large family that I have,
###282 how would I protect them?
###284 I've got 10 children.
###287 My youngest is 8 years old and my oldest is,
###291 be 41 this year, so quite a range.
###296 <i> Narrator: Today, Brent's  assembling his clan to</i>
###298 <i> practice bugging  out to the castle.</i>
###301 Brent: We're gonna be doing all types of
###302 training, things you've never seen
###303 or done before.
###304 <i> Narrator: But once  they get up there,</i>
###306 <i> he'll have a surprise  in store for them.</i>
###309 <i> He wants his family's help  finishing the castle,</i>
###312 <i> but fears few of  his ten children are</i>
###313 <i> truly up to  the challenge.</i>
###316 Ashley: How are we going to bathe?
###317 How are we going to survive?
###319 When I told the kids what I was going to do,
###322 they kind of laughed and said,
###324 "What?
###324 A castle?
###325 Why are you building something
###327 like that out there?"
###328 My oldest one is Brent the Second.
###331 I don't know what his strength is.
###333 He should be one of the most knowledgeable,
###334 but that's not the way it is right at this moment.
###337 Brent Jr.: You're gonna show me how
###338 to use this thing?
###339 Brent: I'm sure we'll get through all that.
###340 Brent Jr.: Alright.
###341 Brent: If anyone thinks that I'm paranoid,
###343 it's probably Ashley that would be the oldest
###345 child from my second marriage.
###347 Ashley is the model of the family.
###350 She is more of a primper than a prepper though.
###353 Ashley: My plan is basically,
###354 to grab my makeup, grab my little Tebow dog
###358 and just head out.
###360 Brent: We had two twins, a boy-girl twin
###362 that are 19 years of age.
###363 And the twins' names are Michael and Dawn-Marie.
###367 Dawn-Marie: I'm not sure if the end of the
###369 world is going to happen but if it does,
###371 it's always better to be prepared than
###373 not be prepared.
###374 Michael: The castle.
###375 It's not finished yet, but I know that when
###376 it is going to be finished,
###378 it's going to be amazing up there.
###380 Brent: Let's, go everybody.
###382 It's a long walk up there.
###383 Okay, so everything we can carry,
###385 we want to carry it now.
###387 Son: C'mon guys, keep up.
###389 A little bit further.
###391 Daughter: We getting close?
###392 Brent: They thought it was real simple.
###393 You grab some things and you run for the hills,
###396 well, it doesn't work that way.
###398 Michael: Alright, we gotta check
###399 the perimeter.
###401 Girls, get the rear.
###402 Brent: Alright, let's go.
###405 Let's get everything inside.
###407 <i> Narrator: Now that  they've arrived,</i>
###409 <i> Brent's kids are about  to learn the true reason</i>
###412 <i> they've been assembled.</i>
###413 Dawn-Marie: Alright.
###414 Let's set up all the chairs.
###416 Brent: I decided I was not going to leave my kids
###419 with a fortune of money.
###421 One of the main reasons for having you all come up
###423 is 'cause I wanted to tell y'all something.
###425 I wanted to reveal it in the midst of as many, uh,
###428 of my family members, uh, as I possibly could.
###432 I'm taking whatever money I have at,
###435 at my death other than some small amounts,
###437 and, and putting it into this castle.
###440 It has been put into what I call
###442 the last retreat family trust.
###444 It's designed to last 100 years,
###446 and it can't be broken.
###449 There is no one that can deed it or take it over.
###451 <i> Narrator: Brent's  looking for</i>
###453 <i> an heir to his throne,</i>
###454 <i> someone he can  trust to assume the</i>
###456 <i> responsibility of  finishing construction.</i>
###459 <i> In days of old, the  eldest son would</i>
###461 <i> typically inherit  the crown.</i>
###463 Brent Jr.: I'm the obvious choice.
###464 I'm Brent the Second and I'm the oldest.
###466 He's the king.
###467 I am the prince.
###471 <i> Narrator: But Brent's  decided that only</i>
###472 <i> two of his 10 children,</i>
###474 <i> one from each  of his marriages,</i>
###476 <i> will be executors  of the trust.</i>
###478 Brent: There will be two people that will help be
###480 the executors to make sure everything happens.
###484 Now, I have some ideas of who I'd like it to be,
###486 but how dedicated are you into seeing
###490 my dream come true?
###492 I mean can you make my dream your dream?
###495 There are some certain qualities that
###497 I'm looking for in those two children.
###500 One: they have to really want it and
###502 they believe in it.
###503 Second thing, they have to be is they
###505 have to be knowledgeable.
###507 They either have to know construction,
###508 they have to know business,
###510 they have to know something.
###511 I want to know that they'll
###513 carry out my wishes.
###514 Dawn-Marie: I just want you to know that
###515 I'm very proud you and.
###516 Brent: Thank you, honey.
###517 Dawn-Marie: And I, you're definitely a
###518 role model to this family and some.
###520 Brent: Well, thank you.
###521 Dawn-Marie: Someone that we can look up to.
###522 I think it would be a possibility that my dad
###524 would maybe pick me, because I've definitely
###526 come up here a lot of times and helped my dad.
###529 All the sheetrock, downstairs,
###531 me and my dad did all of that.
###533 Ashley: Amazing, that's awesome and this is the
###534 best gift, better than any Christmas present,
###536 better than anything that I could get,
###539 this right here.
###540 I'm shocked, I didn't expect this.
###542 I think he's gonna choose me.
###543 Um.
###544 I say that because I know more.
###547 I have proven myself more I think.
###551 Brent Jr.: I wanna take on your dream, like you said,
###554 and help you get this, get the roof on this place
###556 and get this place completed.
###558 So I'll be working twice as hard.
###560 Michael: I think what's important is if you
###561 actually care about this mountain house,
###563 then you should just prove it.
###565 Dawn-Marie: Yep.
###566 I agree.
###567 Michael: He needs you to do something, do it.
###569 Use your actions and not your words.
###570 Brent: Dawn-Marie's spent the most,
###572 most time with me.
###573 Michael would be second.
###574 Brent has never been up here really,
###575 he's really not contributed.
###576 And Ashley really hasn't, she's been up here as a
###578 little child, but not what I would call contributing.
###582 <i> Narrator: Brent wants  today to be the day he</i>
###584 <i> decides which two of his  offspring are prepper</i>
###587 <i> enough to fill his shoes.</i>
###589 <i> So he's about to put his  kids through the ultimate</i>
###591 <i> series of prepper tests.</i>
###602 <i> Narrator: Brent has  spent the last dozen years,</i>
###604 <i> and a small fortune,</i>
###606 <i> building a literal  castle to serve as</i>
###608 <i> his family's fortress  in the Carolina's</i>
###610 <i> during the end times.</i>
###612 Brent: My particular piece of property is
###614 50 acres surrounded by 1,000 acres.
###617 There is only one way in.
###619 It is literally almost cliffs on
###621 each side to get up.
###623 The property has a 400-foot well with a
###627 stream running right past it.
###629 I bought 40,000 heirloom seeds so we
###632 can grow any kind of a vegetable.
###635 <i> Narrator: To determine  which two of his</i>
###636 <i> kids will become  heirs to his throne,</i>
###639 <i> he's assembled his  extended family at the</i>
###640 <i> castle this weekend  for a series of tests.</i>
###644 Brent: I'm going to be looking at these kids,
###645 each one of them today to see how they interact,
###648 how tempers flare, how, who helps who.
###651 <i> Narrator: Brent fears  America's enemies could</i>
###653 <i> one day detonate a nuclear  device in the atmosphere</i>
###656 <i> creating an EMP, an  electromagnetic pulse,</i>
###659 <i> which could  blackout America.</i>
###662 <i> So for his first test,  he's judging their</i>
###664 <i> prepping ability by  having them construct a</i>
###667 <i> power supply  for the castle.</i>
###669 Brent: We need batteries.
###670 We need windmills.
###672 We need solar panels.
###673 We need to be able to run on 12 volt, 24 volt,
###676 48 volt or the standard 120-volt.
###680 Dawn-Marie: Dad, what exactly are we doing?
###682 What are we making?
###683 Brent: It's called a solar panel array.
###686 We're gonna have eight solar panels,
###688 mounted to this bracket that can tilt
###691 however we want it so it's facing the sun.
###695 <i> Narrator: Brent plans to  use solar panels to charge</i>
###697 <i> a bank of batteries,  which will then help</i>
###699 <i> provide electricity  for the castle.</i>
###702 <i> If his kids can  figure out how to get</i>
###704 <i> the array assembled.</i>
###706 Ashley: Where are the instructions?
###708 Michael: We don't need instructions.
###709 Brent: We put it together 12 years ago, now we.
###712 Ashley: Women read instructions, men don't.
###716 Brent: We're gonna be facing south because the
###718 sun comes from east to west and that's a southern
###722 direction right there, so we want the most sun
###724 during the day to these solar panels.
###726 Dawn-Marie: How do you know that's south?
###728 Brent: I have a compass.
###729 Dawn-Marie is the wild child of the family.
###732 A true "A" personality.
###734 But when it comes to counting on somebody I
###736 know that we can always count on her.
###739 Oh!
###740 Michael!
###741 Michael: Come on, it's right there.
###742 It's fine.
###743 Brent: Michael, I know he's gonna be a great
###745 asset to the family.
###746 I would say his weakness is Michael still has
###749 not yet learned responsibility.
###752 <i> Narrator: With the solar  panel assembled Brent's</i>
###754 <i> one step closer to  being able to power his</i>
###756 <i> castle after doomsday.</i>
###759 <i> But he's still no  closer to deciding who</i>
###761 <i> his two trustees will be.</i>
###763 Brent: I need to look more in depth at each child as
###766 far as seeing who I think should be a
###768 leader in the trust.
###769 It's gonna take some more time.
###771 We're gonna have to go through maybe
###773 a few more tests.
###774 Okay, we're done.
###775 Let's go see what the next project is.
###780 <i> Narrator: Having  assembled their alternate</i>
###781 <i> power supply,  Brent takes time to work</i>
###784 <i> with his firstborn  son, Brent Jr.,</i>
###786 <i> on what he feels  is his weakest</i>
###788 <i> prepping  skill, defense.</i>
###791 Brent Jr.: What can I learn today?
###792 Brent: Some of my children that don't live
###794 right next to me really have no idea
###798 how to handle a weapon.
###799 Brent the Second, which is my oldest child,
###801 worries me the most 'cause I've never seen him,
###804 to my knowledge he's never had any training.
###806 I asked him to choose a weapon and he picks up
###809 an AK47 and the first thing I said is,
###811 "Do you know how to use that?"
###812 This has to be down.
###813 Brent Jr.: Okay.
###814 Brent: 'Cause that is your safety on
###815 this particular gun.
###816 Now we're loaded.
###818 Brent Jr.: Okay.
###819 So it's live?
###820 Brent: It's live.
###821 Please do not point it in my direction.
###822 Brent Jr.: Okay.
###823 Brent: We chose guns that were like
###825 police-type weapons.
###826 Or army-type weapons.
###828 An AR15 or an AK47.
###831 It needed to be something that was pretty standard
###833 and there were a lot of.
###835 You're ready to shoot.
###836 Brent Jr.: Alright I am.
###837 Just aim and shoot?
###839 Brent: Hold up a minute.
###840 Uh, you wanna put some earplugs in here.
###842 Brent Jr.: Do you really?
###843 I don't need earplugs.
###844 Brent: Alright.
###845 Brent Jr.: You ready?
###846 Brent: Well since it's your first time,
###847 let's go for the biggest target which
###848 will be that can up top.
###852 Brent Jr.: Did I hit it?
###853 Brent: I have not the foggiest idea the
###856 way you were firing.
###857 Brent Jr.: My ears are ringing now.
###859 Brent: Do you know what happens when you
###860 fire that many times?
###861 Brent Jr.: What's that?
###862 Brent: Because the gun is pulling back.
###863 Brent Jr.: I need you to speak louder.
###864 Brent: You're going up higher and
###866 higher and higher.
###867 I'd be more fearful of him shooting one of us
###869 than shooting somebody else that might be out
###871 there so we're definitely gonna have to spend
###872 some time with him.
###874 Okay, put it in your shoulder.
###876 Dawn-Marie is coming along.
###878 After she shot the gun a couple time she settled
###880 down and she really got serious about it.
###882 Ashley had never shot a shotgun.
###884 She was a little scared,
###885 she didn't know how noisy it was gonna be.
###887 Ashley: I'm so scared.
###889 (Screams).
###892 I don't like that.
###893 I don't like that.
###895 Brent: Probably the best shooter was
###897 probably Michael out there.
###900 <i> Narrator: A severe  thunderstorm rolls in,</i>
###903 <i> but they're not  taking shelter.</i>
###905 <i> During medieval times, as  few as 20 men inside a</i>
###908 <i> well-fortified castle  could hold back</i>
###910 <i> an army of thousands.</i>
###914 <i> Brent's using the storm as  an opportunity to see if</i>
###916 <i> his potential heirs  can defend the castle</i>
###919 <i> as a unit under  harsh conditions.</i>
###922 Brent Jr.: Alright.
###923 Are we ready?
###924 Let's go.
###924 It's a rainy day;
###925 you know there's people out there
###926 getting ready to attack.
###928 Brent: After one person shoots, you move back.
###931 Son: Let's go.
###932 Brent: And another person moves in.
###933 When the girls are out, the archers come in,
###935 two at a time.
###938 Amanda: Pull back.
###939 Now push it back in.
###942 Pull down, but not all the way.
###944 Ashley: But not yet though.
###945 Amanda: Yeah.
###946 Brent: Alright, two more people.
###948 Son: Alright.
###948 Brent: Good, very good.
###950 The reason for the shooting drill tonight was
###952 to see how everyone would react under a
###954 simulated firing condition.
###956 Could everybody work in unison?
###958 There was some complaining.
###959 Brent Jr.: I feel like I just jumped in a lake.
###961 Brent: Everybody was tired;
###962 everybody was hungry.
###963 That is the worst situation you could
###965 ever have in any kind of a firefight.
###967 You two are taking shots, you're taking a shot.
###970 I was real proud of all of them.
###971 They did a good job.
###972 <i> Narrator: Exhausted and  soaked to the skin,</i>
###975 <i> Brent's kids are eager  for a chance to rest</i>
###977 <i> and get some food.</i>
###979 <i> But this weekend,  everything is a test.</i>
###982 <i> Even dinner.</i>
###984 Brent: Let's go!
###985 Let's go!
###985 People are hungry!
###986 We did something that none of the
###988 kids have ever done on this trip.
###989 We gave each of them an MRE.
###991 <i> Narrator: "Meals  ready to eat"</i>
###992 <i> or MRE's are essentially  1,200 calorie canned</i>
###995 <i> meals in light  aluminum pouches that</i>
###998 <i> can last at least  three years</i>
###1000 <i> when stored at a  cool temperature.</i>
###1002 <i> Brent's had some  of his for 12.</i>
###1005 Ashley: Are those still safe to eat?
###1007 Brent: Well, I've had one every year to
###1009 test it myself, ate it, never got sick, so.
###1012 We tried to make this training exercise
###1016 as real life as possible.
###1018 I chose probably the worst thing to eat out of
###1020 everything that we could have possibly have made.
###1022 I had to make sure they could at least
###1024 stomach the MRE's.
###1025 Brent Jr.: Alright, who wants to take a
###1027 bite of this 12-year-old beef patty?
###1029 Brent: They weren't too happy about those things.
###1032 Girlfriend: It smells terrible.
###1034 Brent: Nobody got sick, that was a good thing.
###1036 Actually Michael thought it was tremendous.
###1040 He was sharing it with everybody ah, there.
###1042 Dawn-Marie: Does it taste like ravioli?
###1044 Michael: Yeah.
###1045 Tastes good.
###1046 Brother: It's not that bad.
###1047 Michael: It's not bad at all.
###1049 Brent: Taste it.
###1050 Come on.
###1051 I thought you were the one that.
###1054 Dawn-Marie: It is good.
###1057 Brent: Dawn-Marie when she put the MRE in her
###1059 mouth she was gagging on it a little bit.
###1062 What are you doing?
###1064 Dawn-Marie: I'm not hungry.
###1065 Brent: She's gonna have to remember,
###1066 when it comes down to a true survival situation,
###1069 she's gonna have to take what she can get,
###1071 and be satisfied with it.
###1073 <i> Narrator: As night falls  on Brent's kingdom,</i>
###1076 <i> he reflects on his  kids' performances.</i>
###1079 <i> But Mother Nature  is about to unleash</i>
###1081 <i> one more unexpected  trial on them all.</i>
###1086 Shane: I got sparks.

###1097 <i> Narrator: Fearful  that an EMP attack could</i>
###1098 <i> knock out  America's power grid,</i>
###1100 <i> Brent has been  constructing a</i>
###1102 <i> medieval castle in  the Carolina Mountains.</i>
###1105 <i> If a medieval castle's  outer defenses ever fell,</i>
###1108 <i> the king could often  retreat to a fortified</i>
###1110 <i> tower within,  called a keep.</i>
###1114 <i> As a violent thunderstorm  besieges Brent's castle,</i>
###1117 <i> he and his kids retreat  to a keep of their own,</i>
###1120 <i> a 2,000-square-foot  bunker,</i>
###1123 <i> stocked with almost  two years of supplies.</i>
###1126 Brent: We put in a complete water and
###1128 sanitation system with a water tank inside,
###1131 250-350 gallons.
###1134 We put showers in.
###1136 We have bedrooms and a kitchen in so that if we
###1140 ever had to live there, we could do that.
###1142 <i> Narrator: But as the  storm rages outside,</i>
###1146 <i> Brent and his kids  discover the bunker itself</i>
###1149 <i> could be the greatest  threat to their safety.</i>
###1151 Brent: This is a little strange.
###1153 Here we build a whole house out of.
###1155 <i> [circut breaker pops]</i>
###1161 That was pretty real.
###1163 <i> [girl screams]</i>
###1164 That's even realer.
###1165 Dawn-Marie: Power's out, power is out.
###1170 <i> [electricity pops]</i>
###1171 Brent: We saw something I had never seen before,
###1174 and that was sparks and lightning jumping
###1177 across the walls.
###1178 <i> Narrator: What began  as a series of tests</i>
###1181 <i> has just turned into  a real potential</i>
###1183 <i> disaster scenario.</i>
###1185 Brent: Don't anybody touch any of the metal
###1187 that's in this door.
###1188 <i> Narrator: This gives Brent  the unexpected opportunity</i>
###1190 <i> to observe how his kids  deal with the crisis.</i>
###1193 Brent: Some got really, really scared.
###1195 Some just kinda sat there for a little while.
###1197 Brent Jr.: I think this bunker, is, is,
###1199 could be a death trap right now and
###1200 it could electrocute us.
###1202 I'd hate to be preparing for the end of the world,
###1204 and while we're preparing get killed.
###1207 Brent: Whoa, we just blew out the lights.
###1210 Even I wasn't sure what to do because it was so
###1213 unexplainable and I think in a true cataclysmic
###1216 event that's exactly the way it's gonna be.
###1218 Nothing was making any sense.
###1220 We, we're just running around with
###1222 lights exploding.
###1223 Ashley: Guys, is this supposed to be
###1224 happening right now?
###1225 Brent: Now I know exactly what it is.
###1227 Coming out of the top of the building we
###1229 got all that rebar, and it's acting
###1231 like lightning rods.
###1232 Shane: Right, that's exposed.
###1233 Brent: It's all exposed and it's going
###1234 right down through the concrete.
###1236 Brent Jr.: It's not grounded?
###1237 Brent: No, it's grounded.
###1238 It's going right into the concrete here.
###1239 Looking back I think we figured out
###1240 what the problem was.
###1242 We filled the block with steel.
###1245 And so I realize now that we do have to put a
###1248 lightning rod and tie it to all of our electrical
###1250 and that should take care of the problem.
###1253 <i> Narrator: Brent's  children won't learn</i>
###1254 <i> which two have  inherited his kingdom</i>
###1256 <i> until after he's dead.</i>
###1258 <i> He had hoped that this  weekend drill would make</i>
###1260 <i> the choice clearer,  but instead,</i>
###1263 <i> the king is now  less certain than</i>
###1264 <i> ever about choosing  his successors.</i>
###1267 Brent: I learned a lot about each of
###1268 my children this weekend.
###1269 Michael, he still shows good leadership,
###1272 but he's very impulsive, and
###1275 that has to be tamed down.
###1276 Brent came here knowing nothing about a gun.
###1279 He did pretty well with it.
###1281 Ashley came and I saw some strength come out of her.
###1284 Dawn-Marie was Dawn-Marie.
###1286 She just chipped in and wanted to be
###1288 a part of everything.
###1290 I think we still need a lot of training.
###1292 I need to look more in depth at each child
###1295 as far as seeing who I think should be a
###1297 leader in the trust.
###1298 I don't think any full decision has been made.
###1300 I thought I knew but I'm not 100% sure.
###1303 Dawn-Marie: Family.
###1304 Brent: I love y'all.
###1307 <i> Narrator: Brent,  the experts at</i>
###1309 <i> Practical Preppers have  reviewed your preps.</i>
###1312 <i> Much of your food  supply is outdated and</i>
###1314 <i> may not be fit  for consumption.</i>
###1316 <i> You need to implement  a re-supply plan</i>
###1318 <i> for the long term.</i>
###1320 Brent: The MRE's we've tested 'em.
###1321 Uh, but they probably do need to
###1323 be replenished here at the castle because
###1325 they do go back as far as 12 years.
###1327 <i> Narrator: Your isolated  location is ideal for</i>
###1330 <i> security, but your  castle is unfinished,</i>
###1333 <i> and the entire  structure is unsafe</i>
###1335 <i> during electrical storms.</i>
###1337 <i> You need to finish  the structure,</i>
###1339 <i> and address issues  that are currently a</i>
###1340 <i> danger to your family.</i>
###1342 Brent: I don't think that they really took
###1344 into account any additional things that
###1346 we may have on order.
###1348 We do not have everything in place yet.
###1350 <i> Narrator: To determine how  long you could initially</i>
###1352 <i> survive a catastrophe,  Practical Preppers has</i>
###1355 <i> scored your preps in five  categories of 20 points</i>
###1358 <i> each, for a total  possible score of 100.</i>
###1362 <i> Much of your food  supply is beyond its</i>
###1364 <i> expiration date: 9  out of 20 points.</i>
###1368 <i> Water: 13 out  of 20 points.</i>

###1373 <i> you'll be able to  take full advantage</i>
###1375 <i> of your remote location.</i>
###1377 <i> 18 out of 20 points.</i>
###1379 <i> Security: 14 out  of 20 points.</i>
###1382 <i> Your bunker and  the castle's unique</i>

###1388 <i> Your total score  is 68 out of 100.</i>
###1391 <i> You have 11 months  initial survival time.</i>
###1394 Brent: I think I have to disagree a little
###1395 bit on what we have here in our storage.
###1397 I don't think the evaluator has any
###1399 idea what we truly have.
###1400 I do agree that, uh, in the meantime we do
###1403 need to work on a couple of the items
###1404 that have been suggested.
###1408 Since the crew was here, we've done a number of,
###1410 uh, changes to the castle.
###1413 We've extended all the pillars that are gonna
###1415 support all the decks around the castle to full
###1418 height so that we can pour a concrete roof
###1421 and a concrete deck.
###1422 We've also purchased some additional food and
###1425 a couple of accessory items for our to-go bags
###1429 in case we have to get outta dodge.
###1433 <i> Narrator: The  U.S. power grid</i>
###1435 <i> already has some  protections in place,</i>
###1437 <i> and experts are  contemplating additional</i>
###1439 <i> measures that  would help guard</i>
###1440 <i> against nuclear EMPs.</i>
###1442 <i> However, the likelihood  of such an attack</i>
###1445 <i> is generally  considered very remote.</i>
###1450 <i> Only 400 miles away  in North Carolina,</i>
###1453 <i> Derek Price also  fears an EMP will soon</i>
###1456 <i> blackout civilization  and send society</i>
###1458 <i> reeling back through time.</i>
###1460 Derek Price: Got my small pocket pistol.
###1462 Go.
###1463 <i> Narrator: He's building  a doomsday fortress</i>
###1465 <i> of his own, but he  doesn't want to live</i>
###1467 <i> like a medieval knight.</i>
###1468 <i> Instead, he's taking  his family back to</i>
###1471 <i> the Wild, Wild West.</i>
###1481 <i> Narrator: In the  remote town of Bear Grass,</i>
###1483 <i> North Carolina  is a locally owned</i>
###1485 <i> amusement park  called Deadwood.</i>
###1488 <i> Every week, thousands  of visitors travel</i>
###1490 <i> back to the days of  gunslingers and outlaws.</i>
###1493 Cowboy: Come on, come on!
###1495 This way, this way!
###1501 I got the whiskey!
###1504 We give up!
###1505 <i> Narrator: But visitors  may not realize,</i>
###1507 <i> Deadwood isn't  just a theme park.</i>
###1509 <i> It's a front, for  one family's plan to</i>
###1512 <i> survive the end  of the world.</i>
###1515 Derek Price: Initially this was just a plan
###1517 to provide a small, secure storage area.
###1519 Now the whole back yard is being used as a fortress.
###1529 I'm preparing for a solar flare and
###1531 an EMP that will end civilization and
###1532 send us back to the Wild West.
###1541 I've been obsessed for a long time.
###1543 I've used the business maybe as an excuse to,
###1547 to satisfy some, some level of obsession.
###1551 And, you know, maybe it is paranoia.
###1554 I would argue that Deadwood might be a
###1555 cover for some of me and my family's
###1558 more fringe interests.
###1560 We are concerned about a solar flare and
###1563 loss of electricity, possibly sending our way
###1566 of life back at least to the Wild West.
###1571 <i> Narrator: Solar flares  are massive bursts of</i>
###1573 <i> energy released  by the sun.</i>
###1575 <i> If an eruption on the  sun is large enough,</i>
###1577 <i> the shockwave of  energized particles can</i>
###1579 <i> slam into the earth's  magnetic field,</i>
###1582 <i> unloading trillions of  watts of power into the</i>
###1584 <i> atmosphere and frying  electric grids in its way.</i>
###1588 Derek Price: You'd lose refrigeration
###1590 in your grocery stores.
###1591 Your food supply chain would break down.
###1594 People who are on normal medications
###1596 would not have access to 'em.
###1598 We're preparing for the lawless days that
###1600 might ensue, if society breaks down because
###1603 of the loss of electricity.
###1605 I think two or three days at the most and
###1607 we'd have complete chaos, uh, looting, raiding.
###1610 Those people could be people that we know.
###1613 <i> Narrator: Derek's family  has spent the last</i>
###1615 <i> 20 years, and more  than $100,000,</i>
###1618 <i> preparing for a  future Dark Age.</i>
###1621 Ira Price: Yeah, I think that oughta do it.
###1623 Straight line of sight.
###1624 How about right here?
###1625 <i> Narrator: And all the  profits they make</i>
###1626 <i> from ticket sales  go directly to</i>
###1628 <i> secretly prepping  Deadwood.</i>
###1630 <i> Derek wants the  park to operate as</i>
###1632 <i> a real outpost to  defend his family,</i>
###1635 <i> if a solar flare  disrupts electricity.</i>
###1638 Derek Price: In the event of a solar flare,
###1640 Deadwood would come to life.
###1641 We would, uh, go back to a time much like
###1644 200 years ago in the frontier where, uh,
###1646 Deadwood would become a defensive center
###1648 for our family.
###1650 <i> Narrator: Everything  in Deadwood has a</i>
###1651 <i> secret prepping purpose.</i>
###1653 <i> To ensure his family can  stay well-nourished as</i>
###1655 <i> they defend the compound,  the park's restaurant</i>
###1658 <i> conceals Derek's  Armageddon-sized</i>
###1660 <i> food orders.</i>
###1661 Derek Price: My therapist would probably
###1663 argue that the only reason we run a
###1665 restaurant at Deadwood is I can
###1666 kind of covertly prep.
###1668 My system is, you know, ten cases for the
###1670 restaurant, one case for Derek.
###1672 I try to keep at least a year worth of food
###1675 for me and my extended family,
###1677 probably 15 people.
###1678 <i> Narrator: Leftover oil  from the restaurant is</i>
###1680 <i> converted to bio-diesel,</i>
###1682 <i> which is used to  power Deadwood's train.</i>
###1685 Derek Price: This train runs on bio-diesel,
###1687 and I'll be able to power it practically
###1689 indefinitely using the leftover waste oil
###1691 that I have stored around here.
###1693 In a post-apocalyptic future,
###1695 I'll still be able to use it to patrol our perimeter
###1698 and move our goods and services in and
###1700 out of the facility here.
###1702 <i> Narrator: Even the  putt-putt golf course</i>
###1703 <i> was built with the  apocalypse in mind.</i>
###1706 <i> From here, Derek  and his brother,</i>
###1707 <i> Daniel, can fire at  unwanted visitors,</i>
###1710 <i> who they fear may  want to take over</i>
###1712 <i> Deadwood once the  lights go out.</i>
###1715 Daniel Price: At the very top of the putt-putt
###1716 course we have defensive positions here that
###1719 overlook the entire village of Deadwood.
###1722 Part of hole number 14,
###1725 crouching position covers the roadway that
###1728 goes all along the front side of Deadwood.
###1730 Unbeknownst to the paying public,
###1732 this is a series of sniper positions,
###1735 concrete reinforced with lots of exits and
###1738 lots of fields of fire.
###1740 <i> Narrator: Lately,  most of Derek's time,</i>
###1742 <i> and almost all of  Deadwood's profits,</i>
###1744 <i> have been funneled into  his biggest prep yet.</i>
###1747 <i> His doomsday fort.</i>
###1754 Derek Price: We were able to camouflage our
###1756 fortress in plain sight in the period that
###1760 we've modeled our business around the Old West,
###1763 and ah, nobody would raise any eyebrows.
###1766 I have this ability to build big, weird things.
###1771 And now you know my paranoia,
###1773 my obsession has led me to take on a project
###1776 that who else would take on.
###1780 <i> Narrator: Derek's  4,000-square-foot fort</i>
###1782 <i> is only halfway finished.</i>
###1784 Derek Price: Okay, so we'll just cut that 10 foot.
###1786 <i> Narrator: A typical  amusement park building</i>
###1788 <i> façade is made  of plywood and</i>
###1789 <i> might normally cost  Derek around $100.</i>
###1792 <i> So far, Derek's fort  has cost him $20,000,</i>
###1796 <i> and he expects that  price to double.</i>
###1799 <i> Unlike a theme park  model, it's reinforced</i>
###1801 <i> with eight inches  of concrete and rebar,</i>
###1803 <i> which Derek believes  is enough to withstand</i>
###1806 <i> point blank fire  from a machine gun.</i>
###1808 Derek Price: Bulletproof, bombproof, stormproof.
###1811 Ira Price: Well, not too big a bomb.
###1813 A little bomb's alright.
###1814 You'd have to shoot it 15, 20 times in a spot that
###1818 big to maybe get through that wall.
###1821 And by that time we can take action
###1823 to, to, uh, shut it down.
###1825 Derek Price: It's funny to a certain extent.
###1827 Almost wish somebody would try to break the
###1829 door down so I could see what would happen
###1831 if I did stick a flamethrower out.
###1837 <i> Narrator: Derek's doomsday  fort also includes a</i>
###1839 <i> series of secret  tunnels and hatches.</i>
###1842 Derek Price: Not only can I get out and
###1843 flank somebody, but I can also get in undetected.
###1847 <i> Narrator: This passage  leads to the water well,</i>
###1849 <i> which doubles as a  secret sniper position.</i>
###1855 <i> And the mini black powder  cannon atop the fort can</i>
###1858 <i> be reached by another  hatch on the roof.</i>
###1860 Derek Price: I designed this door
###1862 to be impenetrable.
###1863 It is a quarter-inch plate steel on both
###1864 sides filled with gravel.
###1866 It's bulletproof, bombproof, blast proof,
###1869 and fireproof.
###1870 Nothing is getting through this door.
###1871 If an EMP were to hit,
###1873 this is where I want to make my final stand.
###1885 <i> Narrator: Because Derek  fears modern technology</i>
###1887 <i> will be wiped out by a  massive solar flare,</i>
###1890 <i> when it comes to defending  his Wild West compound,</i>
###1893 <i> he wants to rely on old  fashioned weaponry.</i>
###1896 <i> But when he puts  his ancient arsenal</i>
###1898 <i> to the test,</i>
###1899 <i> his entire defensive  strategy may fizzle.</i>
###1902 Derek Price: Damn.
###1908 Cowboy: Sam, put your pistol down.
###1909 Don't shoot us, boss!
###1911 <i> Narrator:  Three generations of</i>
###1912 <i> Derek Price's family have  created a fantasy world</i>
###1914 <i> that pays the bills on  their real-life obsession:</i>
###1917 <i> prepping for an  apocalyptic solar flare.</i>
###1920 Derek Price: Have we spent too much time?
###1922 Too much money prepping?
###1924 Have we overdone it?
###1926 You know, I'm willing to take that chance.
###1928 <i> Narrator: As his fort  nears completion,</i>
###1929 <i> he's decided to institute  even greater defenses.</i>
###1932 <i> Because he fears a solar  flare will end modern</i>
###1935 <i> life, Derek doesn't plan  to rely on modern weapons.</i>
###1939 <i> Instead, he's borrowing  defense strategies</i>
###1942 <i> from an era  before electricity.</i>
###1945 <i> The first line  of defense starts at</i>
###1947 <i> his property line.</i>
###1949 Daniel Price: I'm more concerned about
###1950 the back perimeter than anything else.
###1952 And uh.
###1953 Derek Price: Back perimeter?
###1954 Well, let's set up some booby traps.
###1956 Hey, hey, this one looks good right here.
###1958 Derek Price: Bamboo isn't native to North Carolina.
###1960 Me and my father planted this about 20 years ago
###1963 because there's so many uses for it.
###1964 Daniel Price: We originally wanted to
###1966 use this as spears and possibly blowguns,
###1968 that's one of the oldest weapons known to humans,
###1971 but, uh, I wanted to make lots and lots of spikes to
###1974 cover your ditches and those dead zones and
###1976 put a lot of hurt coming out of the ground.
###1978 At an angle!
###1979 At an angle!
###1980 <i> Narrator: In  the Vietnam War,</i>
###1981 <i> bamboo spikes  were sharpened,</i>
###1983 <i> then camouflaged and  placed in the ground</i>
###1986 <i> to maim or kill  intruding forces who</i>
###1988 <i> didn't know the terrain.</i>
###1990 Daniel Price: We can't hit 'em with small arms fire.
###1993 We'll send them right into bamboo.
###1994 Derek Price: Be careful.
###1998 Daniel Price: That's perfect.
###2000 This is called a punji pit.
###2001 But in the infantry, in the Airborne Infantry,
###2004 we called it "(Bleep) up a stick."
###2006 Because if you fell on these well,
###2008 you weren't up (bleep) creek,
###2010 you were up (bleep) up a stick.
###2012 They come through this little area with
###2014 a little bit of momentum;
###2015 they don't just stick their foot.
###2017 They stick a torso.
###2019 Person's dead and that's ultimately what we want.
###2022 Derek Price: These things may be really primitive,
###2024 but, uh, you know, in the event we had a
###2026 solar flare we're gonna be back to
###2028 primitive means of defense.
###2029 You know, there's not going to be any
###2031 fancy things we can do.
###2032 You know this right here has been effective
###2034 since the beginning of time.
###2039 Daniel Price: Let's test this sucker.
###2046 Derek Price: All right, go.
###2048 Daniel Price: Oof.
###2049 Derek Price: Oh.
###2051 Oh.
###2052 No, I don't think he's gonna make it.
###2055 Daniel Price: That's the one that did him in.
###2058 Derek Price: Oh yeah.
###2059 That's a lethal blow right there.
###2062 Daniel Price: Right below, above the ribcage.
###2063 Right in the throat.
###2064 <i> Narrator: If intruders  make it past the pits</i>
###2066 <i> filled with spikes,  they'll walk into</i>
###2067 <i> Derek's next  line of defense.</i>
###2069 Derek Price: We consider our cannon probably our
###2072 crown jewel of defensive capabilities
###2075 here at our fortress.
###2077 Initially when we acquired the cannon I think it
###2079 was probably for display purposes and
###2081 by experimentation with it we realized that
###2084 we can defend a very large area with
###2087 a weapon like that.
###2090 <i> Narrator: Derek's  cannon is modeled on</i>
###2091 <i> 19th century black-powder  military cannons.</i>
###2094 <i> During the day  it shoots blanks</i>
###2097 <i> for visitors' enjoyment.</i>
###2098 <i> But today, for  the first time,</i>
###2101 <i> they are filling  it with pellets to</i>
###2102 <i> gauge its aim  and range.</i>
###2105 Daniel Price: Back up about two feet,
###2106 Haven, when you sight it.
###2109 You should only see one circle at the front
###2111 and nothing at the rear.
###2113 Alright, there you go.
###2114 Derek Price: Let's go 10 seconds.
###2118 Put that in there.
###2120 Daniel Price: Fire in the hole!
###2123 Derek Price: Fire.
###2124 Alright stand back, guys.
###2128 Hold on to your hats.
###2129 Here we go.
###2133 Or not.
###2134 Let's be ready because this could probably
###2136 go off at any second without any warning there.
###2139 Stand back.
###2140 Let me see if I can prick it out with this.
###2141 Daniel Price: Wait, wait, wait.
###2143 First tap the end of it.
###2144 Derek Price: We're gonna clear the fuse
###2145 and refuse it.
###2146 This is a bad idea probably.
###2148 Let's stand back.
###2150 <i> Narrator: Derek is  switching from a</i>
###2151 <i> timed fuse to  a pull fuse.</i>
###2155 <i> If the cannon won't  fire reliably this way,</i>
###2158 <i> the family will  have to refigure</i>
###2159 <i> their entire  defense plan.</i>
###2162 Derek Price: We are alive now.
###2164 Okay.
###2165 Daniel Price: Test fire!
###2166 Fire in the hole!
###2169 Derek Price: You ready?
###2170 Here we go.
###2171 3-2-1.
###2175 Damn.
###2178 Daniel Price: Boo-yah!
###2179 That's what I'm talking about.
###2181 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
###2185 Wow, we've got a spread of at least
###2186 12 feet over a 40-feet run right here with
###2190 a lot of dead with a lot of kill shots.
###2193 Derek Price: This would make a real bad day for
###2195 anybody on the business end of that cannon.
###2198 <i> Narrator: Although  they're pleased with the</i>
###2200 <i> cannon's range, they've  also learned that</i>
###2202 <i> vintage weapons  are unreliable.</i>
###2205 Daniel Price: We need to have three or
###2207 four more of these.
###2208 And so that way if one doesn't fire,
###2210 we still have two to three more,
###2211 with cross-sections of fire,
###2213 and I think that would be the most effective thing.
###2215 <i> Narrator: Derek believes  defending Deadwood will</i>
###2217 <i> require every member of  the family to arm himself,</i>
###2220 <i> even his 11-year-old  son, Haven.</i>
###2223 Derek Price: Alright, Haven.
###2224 We're gonna do a perimeter sweep.
###2226 I'm gonna take the south side,
###2227 you take the north side.
###2228 Okay?
###2229 <i> Narrator: In preparation  for a world without</i>
###2231 <i> electricity, he's  been training Haven</i>
###2233 <i> to patrol Deadwood in  the dark of night.</i>
###2236 Haven Price: If a solar flare were to happen,
###2238 probably every place would end up looking like this.
###2241 Derek Price: I think at some level it's
###2243 still an adventure for him right now.
###2245 It's fun and games.
###2246 I mean, he knows I'm carrying a
###2248 loaded weapon at night.
###2250 So, you know, at some level he
###2252 knows it's serious.
###2253 But you know, I don't think it's set in
###2255 on him yet just how serious I'm taking it.
###2257 Haven Price: I tell a few of my friends, you know,
###2259 "My dad has a bunker and everything.
###2261 So we're going to be well protected.
###2262 So if the apocalypse comes we'll be safe
###2265 and you won't!"
###2270 <i> Narrator: So far, Haven's  only been on patrol.</i>
###2274 <i> But Derek wants him  trained for what</i>
###2275 <i> he fears is the  worst case scenario.</i>
###2278 <i> Multiple attackers descend  on Deadwood town square.</i>
###2282 <i> Cannons fail.</i>
###2283 <i> The only option is a gun  battle to the death.</i>
###2286 <i> So Derek's about to put  the entire Price family,</i>
###2289 <i> and all of  Deadwood's defenses,</i>
###2291 <i> through an extreme test.</i>
###2293 <i> And tonight, the  youngest Price will</i>
###2295 <i> be on the front line.</i>
###2297 Haven Price: Stay where you are.
###2298 Don't move.
###2305 <i> Narrator: Derek  Price has built an</i>
###2307 <i> old west fortress  that will serve as</i>
###2309 <i> his stronghold  if a Doomsday</i>
###2311 <i> solar flare wipes  out electricity.</i>
###2313 <i> Tonight Derek, his father  Ira, and son, Haven,</i>
###2317 <i> will face off against  his brother, Daniel,</i>
###2320 <i> and practice driving back  intruders from Deadwood.</i>
###2324 Daniel Price: Gentleman, tonight we're
###2326 gonna be playing an apocalyptic version of
###2329 shells versus skulls.
###2332 An opposing force versus a defensive posture.
###2336 Between the hours of 9 P.M. and 6A.M.
###2339 the three of us will be out and about,
###2341 and we will try to attack and take the dance hall
###2344 from your possession, using whatever tactics
###2347 we deem necessary.
###2348 Your job is to defend the dance hall
###2350 from our assault.
###2351 Are there any questions before we begin?
###2354 Haven Price: Shells rule.
###2356 Derek Price: Lock and load.
###2358 Let's go, guys.
###2359 <i> Narrator: The two teams  are using real weapons,</i>
###2361 <i> but the safeties are on.</i>
###2363 <i> A kill will be determined  by flashing the gun's</i>
###2365 <i> light on the victim  for three seconds.</i>
###2369 Derek Price: I think if you cover the left flank,
###2370 and Haven, if you take the elevated position
###2372 at the top up there, you can cover both of
###2373 those spots at the same time.
###2376 Haven Price: Alright, since I'm taking the
###2377 elevated position I'm thinking I'm gonna go
###2379 with my assault rifle instead of
###2381 this four-ten here.
###2382 Derek Price: Okay, that's fine.
###2383 <i> Narrator: While Derek's  team plots their strategy</i>
###2385 <i> to hold the dancehall,  Daniel's team of</i>
###2387 <i> Deadwood employees is  throwing out the rulebook.</i>
###2391 Daniel Price: If you're playing by the rules,
###2392 you need to change your tactics.
###2394 They're expecting three of us, not four.
###2398 They have to see us.
###2400 They do not have to see her.
###2401 In fact, I don't even want you to make your
###2403 appearance known until you're positive at
###2405 least one or all of us are dead.
###2408 So we've got our advantage.
###2409 Derek is our primary target.
###2411 Without that leadership, Haven will go into
###2413 complete shock that his dad has been taken out
###2416 and neutralized.
###2417 Live well.
###2418 Die hard.
###2419 Let's do it.
###2425 Ira Price: They're both trying to outsmart each
###2427 other, and, uh, Daniel, Daniel is pretty sneaky.
###2432 He'll take an hour.
###2433 He's patient.
###2444 Haven Price: Dad, got movement on
###2445 the right flank.
###2446 But I think it may be a decoy.
###2447 I know, I know what Uncle Dan does.
###2450 Stay where you are.
###2451 Don't move.
###2453 Derek Price: Alright, I'm in position.
###2461 Haven Price: Someone's making a noise.
###2462 Somebody's trying to distract us.
###2465 Granddad, I need cover.
###2466 Over.
###2476 Derek Price: You're dead.
###2481 Haven Price: Somebody hit Daniel.
###2489 Gotcha!
###2507 Derek Price: You're dead.
###2509 That's three!
###2514 Girl: You're dead!
###2516 Derek Price: Son of a bitch.
###2518 Daniel Price: Well, that was pretty fun guys.
###2520 <i> Narrator: The team led by  Derek and Haven seemed to</i>
###2522 <i> have the advantage, but  not expecting Daniel's ace</i>
###2525 <i> in the hole ultimately led  to Derek being killed,</i>
###2528 <i> and the team  losing the drill.</i>
###2529 Derek Price: Trusting my brother would follow the
###2531 rules was a bad idea.
###2533 And you know, he got me.
###2535 But, you know, that's a valuable
###2537 lesson to learn, you know.
###2538 There's no such thing as a fair fight.
###2540 Daniel Price: The major improvements I see is
###2541 we've got to make it a lot more difficult for
###2543 somebody just to walk in and get this close to us.
###2546 We need to know long before they're
###2547 in our perimeter.
###2549 We need to know exactly how many there are.
###2551 Tonight they expected three, there were four.
###2553 A fourth person came into the very center
###2556 of Deadwood and was not even detected.
###2558 Derek Price: She's the stealthiest one out here.
###2560 She's a natural born killer.
###2561 You know just from talking to my employees and
###2564 I know that they know what I'm doing and
###2567 some of 'em openly can't hide the
###2569 fact they think I've completely
###2570 lost my mind, but you know what?
###2573 If it's the end of the world,
###2575 you need to knock on somebody else's door
###2577 'cause mine's going to be shut.
###2578 I didn't spend all my money, all my time,
###2581 sacrificing so much to just open my door to
###2585 somebody that laughed at me the whole
###2587 time I was doing it.
###2589 Nah, it doesn't work that way.
###2595 <i> Narrator: Derek,  the experts at</i>
###2597 <i> Practical Preppers  commend you for</i>
###2599 <i> turning your  amusement park</i>
###2600 <i> into a profit-generating</i>
###2602 <i> fortress that can sustain  you after a disaster.</i>
###2605 Daniel Price: Respect.
###2606 Derek Price: Thank you, absolutely.
###2608 <i> Narrator: However, you  currently do not have</i>
###2610 <i> adequate stored water  to sustain your family.</i>
###2613 Derek Price: I didn't feel the need to
###2614 waste my storage space storing water,
###2617 when I can easily filter water.
###2620 <i> Narrator: To determine how  long you could initially</i>
###2622 <i> survive a catastrophe,  Practical Preppers has</i>
###2624 <i> scored your preps in five  categories of 20 points</i>
###2628 <i> each for a total  possible score of 100.</i>
###2632 <i> Food: 14 out  of 20 points.</i>
###2635 <i> Water: 10 out  of 20 points.</i>
###2638 <i> Shelter: 17 out  of 20 points.</i>
###2641 <i> Security: 13 out  of 20 points.</i>
###2644 <i> The unique space you've  created with Deadwood</i>
###2646 <i> gives you an additional  14 X-factor points.</i>
###2649 <i> Overall, you get  a 68 out of 100.</i>
###2652 <i> You have 12 months  initial survival time.</i>
###2655 Derek Price: I'm gonna agree.
###2656 The first year would probably be the
###2657 easiest as far as food.
###2659 But, uh, I plan on being around
###2660 a lot longer than one year.
###2662 Daniel Price: Absolutely.
###2666 Derek Price: Since the film crew was here we've
###2667 begun Phase Two of our construction on the
###2669 fortress there, which includes our kitchen
###2671 complex and self-contained water supply.
###2675 Ira Price: It took less than two hours
###2676 to put this pump in.
###2678 We have all the water we need.
###2680 Ah, yes.
