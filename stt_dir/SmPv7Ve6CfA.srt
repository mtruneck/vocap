0:0:8,433 --> 0:0:12,626
Every year, millions of animals migrate home.


2
0:0:12,626 --> 0:0:14,593
But some...


3
0:0:14,593 --> 0:0:22,61
...are better at it than others.


4
0:0:22,61 --> 0:0:24,35
I said, wait, this isn't New York.


5
0:0:24,35 --> 0:0:29,373
Well, how do we move through Europe,
without attracting attention?


6
0:0:29,373 --> 0:0:33,171
What?


7
0:0:33,171 --> 0:0:36,46
Attention. We have detected
wild animals on the loose.


8
0:0:36,46 --> 0:0:41,0
Get me Captain DuBois from animal control!


9
0:0:41,0 --> 0:0:44,861
Poor animals.
Now you deal with me.


10
0:0:44,861 --> 0:0:46,606
It's the fuzz! What are we gonna do?


11
0:0:46,606 --> 0:0:49,415
We can't just blend.
You know this ain't Africa.


12
0:0:49,415 --> 0:0:51,0
You gotta let us in!


13
0:0:51,0 --> 0:0:52,791
Go-go-go!


14
0:0:52,791 --> 0:0:55,721
Thanks. We're gonna get off at the next stop,
so we can get back to America.


15
0:0:55,721 --> 0:0:57,25
We're going to America as well!


16
0:0:57,25 --> 0:1:0,795
What? Can we go with you?


17
0:1:0,795 --> 0:1:1,904
Whoa.


18
0:1:1,904 --> 0:1:4,289
This train is for circus animals only.


19
0:1:4,289 --> 0:1:5,797
But we are circus.


20
0:1:5,797 --> 0:1:6,95
What is your act?


21
0:1:6,95 --> 0:1:16,5
Uuh...


22
0:1:16,5 --> 0:1:18,383
Really?


23
0:1:18,383 --> 0:1:23,669
In order to get home, we will come up with
something that will blow everyone away.


24
0:1:23,669 --> 0:1:25,167
I'm on a tightrope!


25
0:1:25,167 --> 0:1:29,706
Melmin?


26
0:1:29,706 --> 0:1:30,65
No.


27
0:1:30,65 --> 0:1:33,279
They'll do whatever it takes...


28
0:1:33,279 --> 0:1:34,779
...to get back home.


29
0:1:34,779 --> 0:1:36,5
Fire in the hole!


30
0:1:36,5 --> 0:1:39,37
Whooo!


31
0:1:39,37 --> 0:1:47,834
Well, that was worth the price of admisson.


32
0:1:47,834 --> 0:1:51,929
You can run, but you cannot save your hide.


33
0:1:51,929 --> 0:1:53,765
What are you doing?
Zebra's can't drive!


34
0:1:53,765 --> 0:1:59,583
Only penguins and people can drive.


35
0:1:59,583 --> 0:2:7,736
Oh, yeah!


36
0:2:7,736 --> 0:2:19,166
Hey. This is not first class.


37
0:2:19,166 --> 0:2:25,708
Has anyone ever told you that
you look like a supermodel?


38
0:2:25,708 --> 0:4:25,708
Whoa! What a woman!
