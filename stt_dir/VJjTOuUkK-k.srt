1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,18



2
0:0:0,18 --> 0:0:1,18
MALE SPEAKER: All right.


3
0:0:1,18 --> 0:0:2,3
I guess we'll get started.


4
0:0:2,3 --> 0:0:3,55
Yeah, very excited to be here.


5
0:0:3,55 --> 0:0:7,341
We have Jon Taffer here
today who many of you know.


6
0:0:7,341 --> 0:0:9,14
Quick background on Jon.


7
0:0:9,14 --> 0:0:10,2
This is from his TV show.


8
0:0:10,2 --> 0:0:11,24
I love the opening.


9
0:0:11,24 --> 0:0:12,94
[ECHOES] Running a bar
is not just a business.


10
0:0:12,94 --> 0:0:14,13
It's a science.


11
0:0:14,13 --> 0:0:16,9
And no one know more about
science than Jon Taffer.


12
0:0:16,9 --> 0:0:19,3
Over the last 36 years,
Jon has transformed


13
0:0:19,3 --> 0:0:21,15
hundreds of failing
bars worldwide.


14
0:0:21,15 --> 0:0:23,94
Using his proven methods
and no nonsense approach,


15
0:0:23,94 --> 0:0:25,979
Jon turns money pits
into money makers.


16
0:0:25,979 --> 0:0:27,27
JON TAFFER: That's pretty good.


17
0:0:27,27 --> 0:0:28,77
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.


18
0:0:28,77 --> 0:0:30,27
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]


19
0:0:30,27 --> 0:0:32,77
JON TAFFER: I'm not
sure I can top that.


20
0:0:32,77 --> 0:0:35,21
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, your
sound guy's awesome.


21
0:0:35,21 --> 0:0:35,78
All right.


22
0:0:35,78 --> 0:0:38,3
But anyway, so Jon is
a very popular host


23
0:0:38,3 --> 0:0:40,69
of the TV show "Bar
Rescue" on Spike TV.


24
0:0:40,69 --> 0:0:43,21
He travels around the
country, finding failing bars


25
0:0:43,21 --> 0:0:44,51
and optimizing them.


26
0:0:44,51 --> 0:0:46,95
He's got a whole science and
strategies and philosophy


27
0:0:46,95 --> 0:0:48,179
on how to optimize a bar.


28
0:0:48,179 --> 0:0:49,97
And at the end, you
know, he leaves the bar


29
0:0:49,97 --> 0:0:53,56
in five days totally changed
and generally successful.


30
0:0:53,56 --> 0:0:56,57
We'll talk about some of
the ones that revert back.


31
0:0:56,57 --> 0:0:58,83
In 2010, he was
appointed president


32
0:0:58,83 --> 0:1:0,534
of the Nightclub
and Bar Media Group.


33
0:1:0,534 --> 0:1:3,75
And then he's recently served
as chairman of Taffer Dynamics,


34
0:1:3,75 --> 0:1:5,79
where he acts as a consultant
to restaurants, nightclubs,


35
0:1:5,79 --> 0:1:8,372
hotels, bars, everything.


36
0:1:8,372 --> 0:1:10,8
And then he just
released his first book,


37
0:1:10,8 --> 0:1:11,8
which is why we're here.


38
0:1:11,8 --> 0:1:12,54
It's called "Raise the Bar.


39
0:1:12,54 --> 0:1:16,2
An Action-based Method for
Maximum Customer Reactions."


40
0:1:16,2 --> 0:1:18,48
And it was published
just a few months ago.


41
0:1:18,48 --> 0:1:20,262
And Jon, like I
said, I'm a huge fan.


42
0:1:20,262 --> 0:1:21,97
So I'm very excited
about this interview.


43
0:1:21,97 --> 0:1:23,2
And a round of applause.


44
0:1:23,2 --> 0:1:23,97
Thank you for being here.


45
0:1:23,97 --> 0:1:24,445
JON TAFFER: Thank you.


46
0:1:24,445 --> 0:1:25,395
Good to be here.


47
0:1:25,395 --> 0:1:28,2
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]


48
0:1:28,2 --> 0:1:29,2
MALE SPEAKER: All right.


49
0:1:29,2 --> 0:1:31,4
So before we jump into
the book, let's first talk


50
0:1:31,4 --> 0:1:32,88
about kind of your journey.


51
0:1:32,88 --> 0:1:35,29
You started out working in
the restaurant/bar industry.


52
0:1:35,29 --> 0:1:38,1
He even ran Barney's Beanery,
which most people here


53
0:1:38,1 --> 0:1:38,78
know about.


54
0:1:38,78 --> 0:1:41,194
And then you went into
the consulting business.


55
0:1:41,194 --> 0:1:43,11
Can you kind of talk
about that transformation


56
0:1:43,11 --> 0:1:46,372
from working and owning bars to
moving into being a consultant?


57
0:1:46,372 --> 0:1:47,8
JON TAFFER: Sure.


58
0:1:47,8 --> 0:1:48,57
I didn't learn this in college.


59
0:1:48,57 --> 0:1:50,53
I was a political science major.


60
0:1:50,53 --> 0:1:52,93
Very glad I didn't go into
that business, by the way.


61
0:1:52,93 --> 0:1:54,95
But I started tending
bar in college.


62
0:1:54,95 --> 0:1:56,25
And one thing led to another.


63
0:1:56,25 --> 0:1:58,4
And as Jon Lennon
once said "life


64
0:1:58,4 --> 0:2:0,45
is what happens when
you make other plans."


65
0:2:0,45 --> 0:2:2,36
And I wound up being
in the bar business


66
0:2:2,36 --> 0:2:4,97
and started as a bartender.


67
0:2:4,97 --> 0:2:7,3
Became a head bartender,
assistant manager,


68
0:2:7,3 --> 0:2:9,3
general manager.


69
0:2:9,3 --> 0:2:10,66
Moved into the hotel arena.


70
0:2:10,66 --> 0:2:13,14
Became a general manager
of a large resort,


71
0:2:13,14 --> 0:2:15,96
and vice president
of a hotel company.


72
0:2:15,96 --> 0:2:19,46
And in the mid-'80s,
tax codes changed.


73
0:2:19,46 --> 0:2:22,78
And hotels couldn't
write off the deductions


74
0:2:22,78 --> 0:2:23,84
that they used to.


75
0:2:23,84 --> 0:2:27,28
So suddenly, restaurants and
hotels had to make money.


76
0:2:27,28 --> 0:2:29,14
They couldn't be
write-offs anymore.


77
0:2:29,14 --> 0:2:30,86
And the hotel
industry had operated


78
0:2:30,86 --> 0:2:34,23
what I call guest
amenities, not businesses.


79
0:2:34,23 --> 0:2:35,1
So I came in.


80
0:2:35,1 --> 0:2:37,4
And I'm that guy
who signed contracts


81
0:2:37,4 --> 0:2:38,731
with all the big
hotel companies.


82
0:2:38,731 --> 0:2:40,48
I'm the guy who closed
all the restaurants


83
0:2:40,48 --> 0:2:42,88
in the top of hotels
all across the country.


84
0:2:42,88 --> 0:2:43,85
Shut them all down.


85
0:2:43,85 --> 0:2:46,65
I'm the first guy who ever put
a leased restaurant in a Holiday


86
0:2:46,65 --> 0:2:49,79
Inn hotel, which was a
very good idea for them,


87
0:2:49,79 --> 0:2:53,78
and really worked very deeply
bringing brands into hotels


88
0:2:53,78 --> 0:2:56,41
and working in hotel food
and beverage when I started.


89
0:2:56,41 --> 0:2:59,95
I wound up doing about 300
hotels all over the world.


90
0:2:59,95 --> 0:3:4,16
Properties like the Park Hyatt
in Sydney, Grand Hyatt Tokyo,


91
0:3:4,16 --> 0:3:7,37
Taipei, Taiwan,
Jerusalem, London,


92
0:3:7,37 --> 0:3:10,41
and started working all over the
world for the hotel industry.


93
0:3:10,41 --> 0:3:14,8
And my whole purpose
was to teach hoteliers


94
0:3:14,8 --> 0:3:15,71
how to do restaurants
and bars that


95
0:3:15,71 --> 0:3:17,82
could compete against
free standing.


96
0:3:17,82 --> 0:3:19,97
Because in those days,
hotels had no credibility


97
0:3:19,97 --> 0:3:21,16
in that arena.


98
0:3:21,16 --> 0:3:22,68
And that's how I started.


99
0:3:22,68 --> 0:3:26,38
And I started my
consulting company in 1986.


100
0:3:26,38 --> 0:3:29,56
And my first client was the
company that I worked for.


101
0:3:29,56 --> 0:3:31,51
So I left, brought them in.


102
0:3:31,51 --> 0:3:35,81
And then my life changed
when Sheraton came up to me


103
0:3:35,81 --> 0:3:37,54
and offered me a major contract.


104
0:3:37,54 --> 0:3:40,32
And I did 40 Sheraton hotels.


105
0:3:40,32 --> 0:3:43,0
And out of the 40 that I
did, if I remember correctly,


106
0:3:43,0 --> 0:3:46,93
18 of them had the highest sales
per foot in food and beverage


107
0:3:46,93 --> 0:3:49,12
in the entire hotel industry.


108
0:3:49,12 --> 0:3:50,72
And then it all took off for me.


109
0:3:50,72 --> 0:3:52,78
Then, my phone started
ringing off the hook.


110
0:3:52,78 --> 0:3:55,97
In 1991, I opened my first--
actually, that's not correct.


111
0:3:55,97 --> 0:3:59,66
In 1989, I opened the first
operation that I ever owned.


112
0:3:59,66 --> 0:4:1,43
Any Green Bay fans here?


113
0:4:1,43 --> 0:4:2,88
Green Bay Packer fans?


114
0:4:2,88 --> 0:4:5,73
First bar I ever owned was
called Lynn Dickey's Sports


115
0:4:5,73 --> 0:4:8,75
Cafe, who was a quarterback
for Green Bay back then.


116
0:4:8,75 --> 0:4:11,4
And I wound up having
three of those.


117
0:4:11,4 --> 0:4:12,54
And what really
changed my life was


118
0:4:12,54 --> 0:4:15,17
Mall of America in
Minneapolis, which


119
0:4:15,17 --> 0:4:17,43
has more visitations than
the city of Las Vegas.


120
0:4:17,43 --> 0:4:19,98
I opened three restaurants
in Mall of America.


121
0:4:19,98 --> 0:4:24,24
The landlord gave me all the
money-- I opened them for free


122
0:4:24,24 --> 0:4:26,77
and two years later,
was a multimillionaire.


123
0:4:26,77 --> 0:4:28,84
And that really changed my life.


124
0:4:28,84 --> 0:4:33,32
And I'm inspired not by
the bricks and mortar.


125
0:4:33,32 --> 0:4:35,89
I'm not inspired
by the food, even


126
0:4:35,89 --> 0:4:37,16
though it's very important.


127
0:4:37,16 --> 0:4:39,72
I'm inspired by the
look on your face.


128
0:4:39,72 --> 0:4:42,42
That's always been
my inspiration.


129
0:4:42,42 --> 0:4:44,93
I don't believe
that we serve food.


130
0:4:44,93 --> 0:4:46,31
I believe we serve reactions.


131
0:4:46,31 --> 0:4:48,12
We achieve it through food.


132
0:4:48,12 --> 0:4:49,48
I don't believe we play music.


133
0:4:49,48 --> 0:4:50,42
We play reactions.


134
0:4:50,42 --> 0:4:51,62
We achieve it through food.


135
0:4:51,62 --> 0:4:54,3
And I don't believe
you guys sell ads.


136
0:4:54,3 --> 0:4:58,33
The fact of the matter is if the
viewer doesn't react to the ad,


137
0:4:58,33 --> 0:4:59,3
the ad is meaningless.


138
0:4:59,3 --> 0:5:0,7
We don't sell ads.


139
0:5:0,7 --> 0:5:1,21
We sell reactions.


140
0:5:1,21 --> 0:5:3,15
We achieve it through
ads, whether they're


141
0:5:3,15 --> 0:5:6,47
client reactions, whether
they're advertiser reactions


142
0:5:6,47 --> 0:5:8,3
or prospect reactions.


143
0:5:8,3 --> 0:5:10,41
And that's what I
learned at a young age.


144
0:5:10,41 --> 0:5:13,94
And that philosophy
changed my life.


145
0:5:13,94 --> 0:5:15,58
And by understanding
the principle


146
0:5:15,58 --> 0:5:17,61
of reaction management--
I own that term.


147
0:5:17,61 --> 0:5:20,57
I actually own the term
"reaction management"--


148
0:5:20,57 --> 0:5:22,54
everything changed for me.


149
0:5:22,54 --> 0:5:24,59
And suddenly I
realized that wow,


150
0:5:24,59 --> 0:5:27,8
I can cause you to do things
you wouldn't normally do.


151
0:5:27,8 --> 0:5:29,837
I can manipulate the hell
out of you if I want to.


152
0:5:29,837 --> 0:5:30,67
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]


153
0:5:30,67 --> 0:5:32,169
JON TAFFER: Make
you buy what I want


154
0:5:32,169 --> 0:5:35,0
you to, go where I want you
to, sit where I want you to.


155
0:5:35,0 --> 0:5:38,34
So I became a nut case
on human behavior.


156
0:5:38,34 --> 0:5:40,4
And things really puzzle me.


157
0:5:40,4 --> 0:5:44,205
For example, 70% of all
people that walk into a mall


158
0:5:44,205 --> 0:5:45,275
make a right hand turn.


159
0:5:45,275 --> 0:5:46,98
Why?


160
0:5:46,98 --> 0:5:47,82
Why?


161
0:5:47,82 --> 0:5:50,983
That -- excuse me--
that shit haunts me.


162
0:5:50,983 --> 0:5:51,95
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]


163
0:5:51,95 --> 0:5:52,94
JON TAFFER: It does!


164
0:5:52,94 --> 0:5:56,74
And it makes me say, what can
I do to make you make a left?


165
0:5:56,74 --> 0:5:59,24
And I will lay awake at
night figuring out ways


166
0:5:59,24 --> 0:6:0,83
to make you make that left turn.


167
0:6:0,83 --> 0:6:2,5
And that's very
rewarding to me when


168
0:6:2,5 --> 0:6:4,389
I can change human behavior.


169
0:6:4,389 --> 0:6:6,68
MALE SPEAKER: Do you think
that's because 90% of people


170
0:6:6,68 --> 0:6:7,809
are right-handed?


171
0:6:7,809 --> 0:6:8,85
JON TAFFER: I'm not sure.


172
0:6:8,85 --> 0:6:9,34
I'm a lefty.


173
0:6:9,34 --> 0:6:10,548
So I couldn't relate to that.


174
0:6:10,548 --> 0:6:12,23
But no, I'm not sure that is.


175
0:6:12,23 --> 0:6:15,66
There's an inherent
movement towards the right.


176
0:6:15,66 --> 0:6:18,139
Maybe it's because we
bear right on roads.


177
0:6:18,139 --> 0:6:20,43
Maybe we even bear right when
we walk through airports.


178
0:6:20,43 --> 0:6:21,73
So maybe that's the principle.


179
0:6:21,73 --> 0:6:24,7
But it's interesting,
when you go to Asia,


180
0:6:24,7 --> 0:6:28,35
and they walk into a mall, they
make a right hand turn too.


181
0:6:28,35 --> 0:6:30,56
So I'm not sure that
argument holds water.


182
0:6:30,56 --> 0:6:33,4
But there are certain
things about human behavior


183
0:6:33,4 --> 0:6:34,97
that are shocking to me.


184
0:6:34,97 --> 0:6:38,17
And there's gold, when
you can change behavior.


185
0:6:38,17 --> 0:6:40,696
Walt Disney was
the master of it.


186
0:6:40,696 --> 0:6:42,32
You go to Walt Disney
World in Orlando.


187
0:6:42,32 --> 0:6:43,506
It's 120 degrees.


188
0:6:43,506 --> 0:6:44,63
You're sweating like crazy.


189
0:6:44,63 --> 0:6:46,569
You spent $90 to walk
through the door.


190
0:6:46,569 --> 0:6:48,11
Within three minutes,
you're standing


191
0:6:48,11 --> 0:6:49,81
on line for an hour and a half.


192
0:6:49,81 --> 0:6:50,31
Right?


193
0:6:50,31 --> 0:6:52,1
You get off the line, you
go through an attraction


194
0:6:52,1 --> 0:6:52,676
for two minutes.


195
0:6:52,676 --> 0:6:55,46
You get on another line
for an hour and a half.


196
0:6:55,46 --> 0:6:58,19
After three lines in five
hours, you've done three things.


197
0:6:58,19 --> 0:6:59,56
Now you want a Coke.


198
0:6:59,56 --> 0:7:1,83
So you stand online for
45 minutes for that.


199
0:7:1,83 --> 0:7:3,719
Now you get a cup with
Mickey Mouse on it.


200
0:7:3,719 --> 0:7:6,26
Now you got to carry this thing
around with you all day long.


201
0:7:6,26 --> 0:7:7,65
$14.95.


202
0:7:7,65 --> 0:7:11,2
And you realize when you go
home with the bags of stuff


203
0:7:11,2 --> 0:7:14,28
you'll never use, the
T-shirt you'll never wear,


204
0:7:14,28 --> 0:7:15,98
you realize wow!


205
0:7:15,98 --> 0:7:20,1
I sweated, I stood in
line, and I loved it.


206
0:7:20,1 --> 0:7:23,26
And there's a manipulative
quality to business.


207
0:7:23,26 --> 0:7:24,96
And you're no different.


208
0:7:24,96 --> 0:7:28,65
When we cause people
to act in ways


209
0:7:28,65 --> 0:7:32,91
that enhance our objectives,
not theirs, we all make money.


210
0:7:32,91 --> 0:7:34,55
So the trick is how
do I get you to do


211
0:7:34,55 --> 0:7:37,23
what isn't natural to you,
but have you love me for it


212
0:7:37,23 --> 0:7:38,19
in the end?


213
0:7:38,19 --> 0:7:39,51
That's the trick.


214
0:7:39,51 --> 0:7:41,59
Because I want you to
come back and do it again.


215
0:7:41,59 --> 0:7:42,9
Right?


216
0:7:42,9 --> 0:7:45,6
There's no such thing as single
transactions in the world.


217
0:7:45,6 --> 0:7:47,132
Everything is
multiple transactions.


218
0:7:47,132 --> 0:7:49,9
I'm all about getting to
that next transaction.


219
0:7:49,9 --> 0:7:50,34
That's what's important to me.


220
0:7:50,34 --> 0:7:51,82
MALE SPEAKER: Great.


221
0:7:51,82 --> 0:7:54,2
So we heard a lot
about your consulting.


222
0:7:54,2 --> 0:7:57,2
How did the TV show come
about with Spike TV?


223
0:7:57,2 --> 0:7:58,11
Did you initiate it?


224
0:7:58,11 --> 0:7:59,22
Did they initiate it?


225
0:7:59,22 --> 0:8:0,14
JON TAFFER: I did.


226
0:8:0,14 --> 0:8:1,5
I'm very proud of this.


227
0:8:1,5 --> 0:8:5,4
I've been a public speaker in
my industry for about 30 years.


228
0:8:5,4 --> 0:8:6,17
And I give keynote speeches.


229
0:8:6,17 --> 0:8:7,76
And I get a lot of
money for speeches.


230
0:8:7,76 --> 0:8:10,27
I've spoken in about 30
countries around the world.


231
0:8:10,27 --> 0:8:12,74
And I'll speak in major
industry conventions.


232
0:8:12,74 --> 0:8:16,73
I'm speaking at Friday's next
week for their corporate event.


233
0:8:16,73 --> 0:8:19,72
And I was giving a
speech in Las Vegas,


234
0:8:19,72 --> 0:8:22,54
and somebody came up to me
and said, you should be on TV.


235
0:8:22,54 --> 0:8:23,752
And I thought about it.


236
0:8:23,752 --> 0:8:25,46
So I went home, and
I wrote something up,


237
0:8:25,46 --> 0:8:27,93
which was originally
called "On the Rocks."


238
0:8:27,93 --> 0:8:29,902
And I came out here and
went to Hermosa Beach


239
0:8:29,902 --> 0:8:31,11
to a friend that owned a bar.


240
0:8:31,11 --> 0:8:34,59
I got a camera, a microphone,
and I got his employees


241
0:8:34,59 --> 0:8:35,26
to work with me.


242
0:8:35,26 --> 0:8:37,559
And I did a three
minutes sizzle reel.


243
0:8:37,559 --> 0:8:39,51
And really it was me
just screaming at people.


244
0:8:39,51 --> 0:8:41,549
I just walked into
his bar, screamed


245
0:8:41,549 --> 0:8:43,73
and yelled at the employees.


246
0:8:43,73 --> 0:8:44,42
"Not negotiable!


247
0:8:44,42 --> 0:8:46,52
You're fired!" and
there's this whole thing.


248
0:8:46,52 --> 0:8:48,83
And I didn't know
anybody in Hollywood.


249
0:8:48,83 --> 0:8:49,63
I was a bar guy.


250
0:8:49,63 --> 0:8:52,91
And so I had this three
minutes sizzle reel.


251
0:8:52,91 --> 0:8:57,49
I sent it cold to five
companies and got three offers--


252
0:8:57,49 --> 0:8:59,63
and it was unbelievable--
within a week.


253
0:8:59,63 --> 0:9:2,89
And I had offers from three
different production companies.


254
0:9:2,89 --> 0:9:5,21
So I had a look at each
company, do background checks,


255
0:9:5,21 --> 0:9:7,57
and the company I picked
was the best one, but not


256
0:9:7,57 --> 0:9:10,4
necessarily the
best financial deal.


257
0:9:10,4 --> 0:9:12,43
So I thought more long
term than short term.


258
0:9:12,43 --> 0:9:15,0
I signed with 3 Ball Productions
in Manhattan Beach, who


259
0:9:15,0 --> 0:9:17,39
also does "Biggest Loser" and
one of the largest reality


260
0:9:17,39 --> 0:9:18,77
show producers.


261
0:9:18,77 --> 0:9:21,6
They picked me up,
signed me to a contract,


262
0:9:21,6 --> 0:9:25,1
and Spike picked up the
show four days later.


263
0:9:25,1 --> 0:9:28,72
So in the time I got the
idea, to the premiere


264
0:9:28,72 --> 0:9:30,76
of the show on
TV-- not the pilot,


265
0:9:30,76 --> 0:9:33,59
the first season--
was less than a year.


266
0:9:33,59 --> 0:9:35,47
And I'm told that's
almost a record.


267
0:9:35,47 --> 0:9:38,24
And normally, it takes
two to three years


268
0:9:38,24 --> 0:9:39,55
to get to that level.


269
0:9:39,55 --> 0:9:41,164
So I was blessed, I think.


270
0:9:41,164 --> 0:9:42,8
Some of that's timing.


271
0:9:42,8 --> 0:9:43,29
I get that I'm pretty
good at what I do.


272
0:9:43,29 --> 0:9:44,2
But some of it is timing.


273
0:9:44,2 --> 0:9:45,74
I just happened to be in the
right place at the right time,


274
0:9:45,74 --> 0:9:46,58
I think.


275
0:9:46,58 --> 0:9:50,8
So the show premiered
almost three years ago.


276
0:9:50,8 --> 0:9:53,665
We just aired our 49th
episode to the highest ratings


277
0:9:53,665 --> 0:9:54,79
in the history of the show.


278
0:9:54,79 --> 0:9:55,26
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]


279
0:9:55,26 --> 0:9:56,176
JON TAFFER: Thank you.


280
0:9:56,176 --> 0:10:0,0



281
0:10:0,0 --> 0:10:3,4
Honestly, it's been an
incredibly humbling experience


282
0:10:3,4 --> 0:10:4,42
for me.


283
0:10:4,42 --> 0:10:8,336
And I'm shocked when celebrities
get these egos that suddenly


284
0:10:8,336 --> 0:10:9,46
you're unimportant to them.


285
0:10:9,46 --> 0:10:10,84
They're above you.


286
0:10:10,84 --> 0:10:15,4
It has made me appreciate
humanity, the people around me


287
0:10:15,4 --> 0:10:17,54
that support me, believe in me.


288
0:10:17,54 --> 0:10:19,365
This has actually made
me a better person.


289
0:10:19,365 --> 0:10:21,24
And I wouldn't have
thought about it that way


290
0:10:21,24 --> 0:10:22,54
before the fact.


291
0:10:22,54 --> 0:10:25,537
But it has humbled me.


292
0:10:25,537 --> 0:10:27,37
I feel like I'm hugged
by America every day.


293
0:10:27,37 --> 0:10:29,85
It's an incredible feeling.


294
0:10:29,85 --> 0:10:30,21
MALE SPEAKER: That's great.


295
0:10:30,21 --> 0:10:33,85
And so 49 episodes-- how do you
decide which bars to rescue?


296
0:10:33,85 --> 0:10:35,43
I'm sure you've got
a ton of requests


297
0:10:35,43 --> 0:10:36,722
from bars all over the country.


298
0:10:36,722 --> 0:10:38,263
And you've done all
over the country.


299
0:10:38,263 --> 0:10:39,47
And some are really awful.


300
0:10:39,47 --> 0:10:41,28
And some are just
horrific, like,


301
0:10:41,28 --> 0:10:42,59
how do you decide which to--


302
0:10:42,59 --> 0:10:43,943
JON TAFFER: That's my choice.


303
0:10:43,943 --> 0:10:45,3
Awful or horrific.


304
0:10:45,3 --> 0:10:46,779
It's pretty accurate too.


305
0:10:46,779 --> 0:10:49,7
Actually, when I did the
show, my deal with the network


306
0:10:49,7 --> 0:10:52,47
was I wanted you to find
me the worst in the world.


307
0:10:52,47 --> 0:10:53,97
I don't want this
to be a cake walk.


308
0:10:53,97 --> 0:10:55,7
I want to fail.


309
0:10:55,7 --> 0:10:56,53
I want to fail.


310
0:10:56,53 --> 0:11:1,35
So now that we're
known, about 1,000 bars


311
0:11:1,35 --> 0:11:3,22
submit applications
a year for me


312
0:11:3,22 --> 0:11:6,25
to scream at them,
which is amazing to me.


313
0:11:6,25 --> 0:11:8,7
And these are people
that are in trouble.


314
0:11:8,7 --> 0:11:9,79
So we go through a
screening process.


315
0:11:9,79 --> 0:11:12,41
First of all, we picked the
cities that make sense to us.


316
0:11:12,41 --> 0:11:14,93
We like small towns, big
towns, Midwest, East Coast.


317
0:11:14,93 --> 0:11:16,78
We like to move it
around and mix it up,


318
0:11:16,78 --> 0:11:18,56
so we have the
different subcultures


319
0:11:18,56 --> 0:11:20,44
of America, if you
will, in a show.


320
0:11:20,44 --> 0:11:22,42
The next thing we do is
we see if they're real.


321
0:11:22,42 --> 0:11:23,77
Are they hustling
me for a remodel?


322
0:11:23,77 --> 0:11:24,895
Or are they really in debt?


323
0:11:24,895 --> 0:11:26,48
Are there really
houses on the line?


324
0:11:26,48 --> 0:11:27,9
Is this a real story?


325
0:11:27,9 --> 0:11:29,52
So we verify those elements.


326
0:11:29,52 --> 0:11:31,36
We verify the debt,
all that kind of stuff.


327
0:11:31,36 --> 0:11:34,8
Make sure that there
are stakes, if you will.


328
0:11:34,8 --> 0:11:38,9
Then, once we've narrowed
it down to about 40 or 50,


329
0:11:38,9 --> 0:11:40,81
then I'll send a
producer to each


330
0:11:40,81 --> 0:11:43,99
of those locations with
just a little camera.


331
0:11:43,99 --> 0:11:47,66
And they'll talk to each staff
member for about 20 seconds.


332
0:11:47,66 --> 0:11:48,16
That's all.


333
0:11:48,16 --> 0:11:48,72
What's your name?


334
0:11:48,72 --> 0:11:49,12
What do you here?


335
0:11:49,12 --> 0:11:50,52
What do you think of this place?


336
0:11:50,52 --> 0:11:50,95
What's your name?


337
0:11:50,95 --> 0:11:51,575
What do you do?


338
0:11:51,575 --> 0:11:55,6
So we can see the
behavior of the employees.


339
0:11:55,6 --> 0:11:57,23
And I'm looking for
a compelling story,


340
0:11:57,23 --> 0:12:0,18
I want you rooting for the
owner or hating the owner.


341
0:12:0,18 --> 0:12:1,9
But I want you connected to it.


342
0:12:1,9 --> 0:12:6,17
And the secret of "Bar Rescue"
is finding those personalities


343
0:12:6,17 --> 0:12:7,72
that are exciting to be with.


344
0:12:7,72 --> 0:12:10,13
And if you think it's
frustrating to watch,


345
0:12:10,13 --> 0:12:13,29
you should live it, Because
it's quite an experience.


346
0:12:13,29 --> 0:12:13,79
Very


347
0:12:13,79 --> 0:12:14,29
MALE SPEAKER: Very cool.


348
0:12:14,29 --> 0:12:15,956
And what would you
say is the number one


349
0:12:15,956 --> 0:12:18,16
reason most bars fail.


350
0:12:18,16 --> 0:12:19,26
JON TAFFER: Excuses.


351
0:12:19,26 --> 0:12:21,98
But that's the reason why
all of you would fail too.


352
0:12:21,98 --> 0:12:23,8
And here it is.


353
0:12:23,8 --> 0:12:24,76
You wake up in the morning.


354
0:12:24,76 --> 0:12:25,936
You're failing.


355
0:12:25,936 --> 0:12:27,6
So you blame the President.


356
0:12:27,6 --> 0:12:27,88
You blame Congress.


357
0:12:27,88 --> 0:12:29,8
You blame Greece.


358
0:12:29,8 --> 0:12:30,41
Blame the Euro.


359
0:12:30,41 --> 0:12:33,23
I mean, construction
industry-- it's the Mayor!


360
0:12:33,23 --> 0:12:34,21
Oh, it's the this.


361
0:12:34,21 --> 0:12:36,7
And you wake up in the morning,
and you look in the mirror.


362
0:12:36,7 --> 0:12:39,158
And you're not failing, because
it's the other guy's fault.


363
0:12:39,158 --> 0:12:40,93
Or it's the economy's fault.


364
0:12:40,93 --> 0:12:42,7
But if you looked in
the mirror and said


365
0:12:42,7 --> 0:12:45,74
I'm failing because I'm
me, you wouldn't like it.


366
0:12:45,74 --> 0:12:47,38
And you'd change that.


367
0:12:47,38 --> 0:12:49,3
And I believe the
common denominator


368
0:12:49,3 --> 0:12:52,42
of failure in any
business is excuses.


369
0:12:52,42 --> 0:12:55,1
As long as you wake up
and blame poor sales


370
0:12:55,1 --> 0:12:57,38
on the economy or
an environment, then


371
0:12:57,38 --> 0:12:59,92
you have no motivation
to make it better,


372
0:12:59,92 --> 0:13:1,6
because it's not your fault.


373
0:13:1,6 --> 0:13:4,23
But in the worst
economic environment,


374
0:13:4,23 --> 0:13:6,81
four, five years in this
country, ago, in this country


375
0:13:6,81 --> 0:13:8,47
that we've seen,
in our lifetimes,


376
0:13:8,47 --> 0:13:10,847
there were people making a
lot of money, weren't there?


377
0:13:10,847 --> 0:13:12,43
In the height of
that recession, there


378
0:13:12,43 --> 0:13:14,75
were people selling advertising,
people opening restaurants,


379
0:13:14,75 --> 0:13:16,2
people building businesses.


380
0:13:16,2 --> 0:13:17,51
Somebody's making money.


381
0:13:17,51 --> 0:13:19,36
So the excuse is bull.


382
0:13:19,36 --> 0:13:20,55
It's bull.


383
0:13:20,55 --> 0:13:23,2
So wake up in the morning
and own your failure.


384
0:13:23,2 --> 0:13:25,48
Look in the mirror and say
I'm failing because of me!


385
0:13:25,48 --> 0:13:27,21
And you won't like it.


386
0:13:27,21 --> 0:13:28,7
And then you'll change it.


387
0:13:28,7 --> 0:13:30,91
But as long as you
don't put it on you,


388
0:13:30,91 --> 0:13:33,0
you have no motivation
to change it.


389
0:13:33,0 --> 0:13:35,75
So in short, if you
own your failure,


390
0:13:35,75 --> 0:13:37,34
you'll own your success.


391
0:13:37,34 --> 0:13:40,2
If you don't own your
failure, you'll never dig out.


392
0:13:40,2 --> 0:13:42,19
And I find that in any business.


393
0:13:42,19 --> 0:13:44,45
Always the common
denominator of failure,


394
0:13:44,45 --> 0:13:46,605
personally, is excuses.


395
0:13:46,605 --> 0:13:48,23
You don't want to be
a failure, do you?


396
0:13:48,23 --> 0:13:49,7
AUDIENCE: Not at all.


397
0:13:49,7 --> 0:13:49,49
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]


398
0:13:49,49 --> 0:13:50,55
JON TAFFER: You don't
want to look in the mirror


399
0:13:50,55 --> 0:13:52,7
and experience that.


400
0:13:52,7 --> 0:13:54,15
If you can't blame
anybody but yourself,


401
0:13:54,15 --> 0:13:55,392
you're going to change.


402
0:13:55,392 --> 0:13:56,6
You're going to fight it out.


403
0:13:56,6 --> 0:13:57,55
That's the deal.


404
0:13:57,55 --> 0:13:58,84
MALE SPEAKER: Great.


405
0:13:58,84 --> 0:14:1,12
So a lot of guys in this
room want to open bars,


406
0:14:1,12 --> 0:14:2,97
like this one sitting up
here in the front row.


407
0:14:2,97 --> 0:14:4,862
What do you say to
these people that


408
0:14:4,862 --> 0:14:6,32
want to open their
own bar one day.


409
0:14:6,32 --> 0:14:8,11
JON TAFFER: Well, first
of all, know your reason.


410
0:14:8,11 --> 0:14:10,25
Anybody see the Murphy's
episode of "Bar Rescue"?


411
0:14:10,25 --> 0:14:12,5
The two frat brothers
opened a bar?


412
0:14:12,5 --> 0:14:12,46
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


413
0:14:12,46 --> 0:14:13,81
JON TAFFER: The last
thing you want to do


414
0:14:13,81 --> 0:14:15,34
is open a bar because
you like to drink.


415
0:14:15,34 --> 0:14:16,173
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]


416
0:14:16,173 --> 0:14:18,12
JON TAFFER: That's like
somebody into drugs


417
0:14:18,12 --> 0:14:19,247
who becomes a pharmacist.


418
0:14:19,247 --> 0:14:20,8
I mean that's just--


419
0:14:20,8 --> 0:14:21,58
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]


420
0:14:21,58 --> 0:14:23,24
JON TAFFER: It makes
no sense at all.


421
0:14:23,24 --> 0:14:24,82
You got do it for
the right reasons.


422
0:14:24,82 --> 0:14:27,0
You've got to do it because
you love the business.


423
0:14:27,0 --> 0:14:28,727
If you love the
social aspect of it,


424
0:14:28,727 --> 0:14:30,6
you'll never do your financials.


425
0:14:30,6 --> 0:14:32,24
You'll just hang with
people all day long.


426
0:14:32,24 --> 0:14:34,45
If you love the drinking,
that's even worse.


427
0:14:34,45 --> 0:14:35,73
You got to love the business.


428
0:14:35,73 --> 0:14:37,1
It's a tough business.


429
0:14:37,1 --> 0:14:39,719
And we were talking before we
started, in the clothing store


430
0:14:39,719 --> 0:14:40,76
business, you buy shirts.


431
0:14:40,76 --> 0:14:42,95
You mark them up 60%, 70%.


432
0:14:42,95 --> 0:14:44,432
If you got 10
shirts on the shelf,


433
0:14:44,432 --> 0:14:46,64
you go home that night, you
come back in the morning,


434
0:14:46,64 --> 0:14:48,1
you still got 10
shirts on a shelf.


435
0:14:48,1 --> 0:14:48,884
Not the bar business.


436
0:14:48,884 --> 0:14:52,36
Bar business, you've got
to manage every minute.


437
0:14:52,36 --> 0:14:53,49
Product is exposed.


438
0:14:53,49 --> 0:14:54,575
Liabilities are exposed.


439
0:14:54,575 --> 0:14:56,69
It's a tough business.


440
0:14:56,69 --> 0:14:58,422
Honestly, if I had
to do it over again,


441
0:14:58,422 --> 0:15:0,13
I'm not sure I would
be in this business.


442
0:15:0,13 --> 0:15:2,64
To be honest with you,
when I look at all the work


443
0:15:2,64 --> 0:15:4,69
that I did over
the years, I could


444
0:15:4,69 --> 0:15:8,13
have applied those efforts
to bigger things rather than


445
0:15:8,13 --> 0:15:9,57
smaller bars.


446
0:15:9,57 --> 0:15:11,83
And I was involved in
Rainforest Cafe, for example.


447
0:15:11,83 --> 0:15:13,7
That went public, and
it was big dollars.


448
0:15:13,7 --> 0:15:14,491
Don't get me wrong.


449
0:15:14,491 --> 0:15:16,56
I don't regret being
in the bar business.


450
0:15:16,56 --> 0:15:20,35
But when I look at my life,
all the nights that I worked,


451
0:15:20,35 --> 0:15:22,92
all those evenings,
days, 20-hour days,


452
0:15:22,92 --> 0:15:25,58
I look back and say gee, wonder
if I would have been a lawyer.


453
0:15:25,58 --> 0:15:26,637
Nah, maybe not a lawyer.


454
0:15:26,637 --> 0:15:27,47
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]


455
0:15:27,47 --> 0:15:28,53
AUDIENCE: No!


456
0:15:28,53 --> 0:15:31,39
JON TAFFER: There are lifestyles
that are easier is my point.


457
0:15:31,39 --> 0:15:33,2
So you've got to
love the business


458
0:15:33,2 --> 0:15:34,59
and be passionate
about it to make it


459
0:15:34,59 --> 0:15:36,877
through those late nights
and those mornings.


460
0:15:36,877 --> 0:15:37,71
MALE SPEAKER: Great.


461
0:15:37,71 --> 0:15:39,48
And what's been the
hardest "Bar Rescue"


462
0:15:39,48 --> 0:15:40,63
you've ever done and why?


463
0:15:40,63 --> 0:15:43,16



464
0:15:43,16 --> 0:15:45,66
JON TAFFER: I'm going to guess
the hardest "Bar Rescue" I've


465
0:15:45,66 --> 0:15:49,86
ever done was the one
that aired-- actually,


466
0:15:49,86 --> 0:15:52,59
the last one with
the two twins, which


467
0:15:52,59 --> 0:15:54,402
aired just about
three weeks ago,


468
0:15:54,402 --> 0:15:56,11
where I had a family--
I mean, these guys


469
0:15:56,11 --> 0:15:58,6
hadn't had Christmas dinner
together in nine years.


470
0:15:58,6 --> 0:16:0,18
They lived across from
each other, these twins,


471
0:16:0,18 --> 0:16:1,9
and they hated each other.


472
0:16:1,9 --> 0:16:3,675
And what I learned
about "Bar Rescue"


473
0:16:3,675 --> 0:16:6,3
is it's so about the people.


474
0:16:6,3 --> 0:16:8,34
And at the end of the day,
I got those twins together.


475
0:16:8,34 --> 0:16:9,874
It was a pretty intense episode.


476
0:16:9,874 --> 0:16:11,29
And I don't know
if any of you saw


477
0:16:11,29 --> 0:16:14,11
that episode-- the
son Tyler, the nephew,


478
0:16:14,11 --> 0:16:17,93
sent me a note that they had
their best Christmas dinner


479
0:16:17,93 --> 0:16:20,12
in all these years
for the family.


480
0:16:20,12 --> 0:16:23,465
So when you have
personalities that don't work,


481
0:16:23,465 --> 0:16:24,34
that's the challenge.


482
0:16:24,34 --> 0:16:25,25
I can paint the bar.


483
0:16:25,25 --> 0:16:26,57
I know how to set it up.


484
0:16:26,57 --> 0:16:27,84
I know how to put
the technology in it.


485
0:16:27,84 --> 0:16:28,923
I know how to decorate it.


486
0:16:28,923 --> 0:16:30,59
I know how to program.


487
0:16:30,59 --> 0:16:32,619
The people--
remember these people


488
0:16:32,619 --> 0:16:34,16
aren't failing
because of their bars.


489
0:16:34,16 --> 0:16:36,41
They're failing because of them.


490
0:16:36,41 --> 0:16:37,569
And that's my challenge.


491
0:16:37,569 --> 0:16:39,11
And that was a
particularly good one.


492
0:16:39,11 --> 0:16:41,193
And I'm going to answer
the next question for you.


493
0:16:41,193 --> 0:16:43,5
The best one we've
ever done is probably


494
0:16:43,5 --> 0:16:47,2
"Spirits on Bourbon," which was
the first episode this season.


495
0:16:47,2 --> 0:16:50,18
They're up $125,000 a month.


496
0:16:50,18 --> 0:16:51,135
AUDIENCE: Holy shit!


497
0:16:51,135 --> 0:16:52,51
JON TAFFER: The
barber shop chair


498
0:16:52,51 --> 0:16:55,44
is the most photographed
attraction on Bourbon Street.


499
0:16:55,44 --> 0:17:0,14
Last month, it did over
$80,000-- just that chair.


500
0:17:0,14 --> 0:17:1,704
And the guys, they
sent me a note.


501
0:17:1,704 --> 0:17:2,87
They've become good friends.


502
0:17:2,87 --> 0:17:5,2
They just bought a
warehouse, so they


503
0:17:5,2 --> 0:17:8,72
can buy cups for their
Resurrection cocktails, 20,000


504
0:17:8,72 --> 0:17:11,28
at a time to keep
their prices down.


505
0:17:11,28 --> 0:17:15,135
And it's to me-- I'm not
always right in life.


506
0:17:15,135 --> 0:17:15,76
None of us are.


507
0:17:15,76 --> 0:17:17,457
But I'm pretty close.


508
0:17:17,457 --> 0:17:18,29
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]


509
0:17:18,29 --> 0:17:20,206
JON TAFFER: When it comes
to the bar business.


510
0:17:20,206 --> 0:17:23,77
People, when they stay with the
plan, tend to do really well.


511
0:17:23,77 --> 0:17:24,85
"Moon Runners"--


512
0:17:24,85 --> 0:17:25,599
MALE SPEAKER: Yup.


513
0:17:25,599 --> 0:17:27,599
JON TAFFER: Which is from
your neck of the wood.


514
0:17:27,599 --> 0:17:29,93
I mean, their
numbers are up 600%.


515
0:17:29,93 --> 0:17:32,3
And there's an independent
website-- forgive me,


516
0:17:32,3 --> 0:17:33,8
I forget the name.


517
0:17:33,8 --> 0:17:35,21
Bar Rescue something--
that somebody does,


518
0:17:35,21 --> 0:17:37,3
and they track them all.


519
0:17:37,3 --> 0:17:40,7
And I believe on their site--
and I haven't been there


520
0:17:40,7 --> 0:17:44,24
in a few weeks-- on their
site, we had aired 47 of 48.


521
0:17:44,24 --> 0:17:46,1
They claim that seven closed.


522
0:17:46,1 --> 0:17:46,75
And I don't count.


523
0:17:46,75 --> 0:17:48,47
So I'm going to take
them at face value.


524
0:17:48,47 --> 0:17:51,249
But what they did is they
did Before and After Yelp.


525
0:17:51,249 --> 0:17:53,29
And then they tell you if
it's opened and closed.


526
0:17:53,29 --> 0:17:55,35
So 48 or 49 episodes are there.


527
0:17:55,35 --> 0:17:58,4
If seven have
closed, that puts us


528
0:17:58,4 --> 0:17:59,726
in about an 80% track record.


529
0:17:59,726 --> 0:18:2,35
And when you consider the depth
of failure these people are in,


530
0:18:2,35 --> 0:18:3,51
I'm pretty proud of that.


531
0:18:3,51 --> 0:18:6,9
I'm not sure we could do much
better, to tell you the truth.


532
0:18:6,9 --> 0:18:8,147
But the pirates episode
has to be mentioned.


533
0:18:8,147 --> 0:18:8,98
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]


534
0:18:8,98 --> 0:18:12,46
JON TAFFER: Only because it
was the most bizarre experience


535
0:18:12,46 --> 0:18:13,42
of my life.


536
0:18:13,42 --> 0:18:15,84
These people were pirates.


537
0:18:15,84 --> 0:18:18,76
They couldn't speak un-pirate.


538
0:18:18,76 --> 0:18:20,76
They couldn't talk like we do.


539
0:18:20,76 --> 0:18:23,97
They spoke like 1845 pirates.


540
0:18:23,97 --> 0:18:23,93
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]


541
0:18:23,93 --> 0:18:26,71
JON TAFFER: They didn't
have regular clothes.


542
0:18:26,71 --> 0:18:30,9
These people woke up every
morning to be pirates.


543
0:18:30,9 --> 0:18:33,49
And when I said to them how
how do you make a living?


544
0:18:33,49 --> 0:18:34,86
Oh, Renaissance Faire.


545
0:18:34,86 --> 0:18:36,18
That's two weeks a year.


546
0:18:36,18 --> 0:18:37,91
Oh, no, there's a
big pirate community.


547
0:18:37,91 --> 0:18:38,74
I go on Facebook.


548
0:18:38,74 --> 0:18:40,8
200 people.


549
0:18:40,8 --> 0:18:42,48
And these people
wanted to be pirates.


550
0:18:42,48 --> 0:18:44,82
And if you remember, when I
put them in regular clothes,


551
0:18:44,82 --> 0:18:47,37
they couldn't speak non-pirate.


552
0:18:47,37 --> 0:18:51,19
So I guess let them play in
their sandbox, so to speak.


553
0:18:51,19 --> 0:18:54,34
But that was a very
frustrating one for me,


554
0:18:54,34 --> 0:18:57,287
because a Discovery TV
was right next door.


555
0:18:57,287 --> 0:18:59,37
There were huge office
buildings in Silver Spring.


556
0:18:59,37 --> 0:19:2,8
The concept that we created
was for lunch and happy hour,


557
0:19:2,8 --> 0:19:5,14
for them to close
early, because at night,


558
0:19:5,14 --> 0:19:7,28
that was a dangerous,
not a very good area.


559
0:19:7,28 --> 0:19:9,79
They never even
opened for lunch.


560
0:19:9,79 --> 0:19:13,1
They tore the sign down
six hours after I left.


561
0:19:13,1 --> 0:19:14,15
It's on YouTube.


562
0:19:14,15 --> 0:19:17,55
A vigil around a fire, where
they were chanting, of course,


563
0:19:17,55 --> 0:19:19,28
pirate songs.


564
0:19:19,28 --> 0:19:23,186
And it was one of the most
bizarre experiences of my life.


565
0:19:23,186 --> 0:19:24,1
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]


566
0:19:24,1 --> 0:19:25,82
JON TAFFER: I will
never forget it.


567
0:19:25,82 --> 0:19:27,64
And they're still
open, by the way,


568
0:19:27,64 --> 0:19:29,902
which is unbelievable to me.


569
0:19:29,902 --> 0:19:32,36
MALE SPEAKER: So you actually
kind of just referenced this.


570
0:19:32,36 --> 0:19:33,38
I know a couple
people in the crowd


571
0:19:33,38 --> 0:19:34,713
had asked me this ahead of time.


572
0:19:34,713 --> 0:19:36,22
But a lot of people
watch your show,


573
0:19:36,22 --> 0:19:38,32
and then they get on Yelp
immediately following,


574
0:19:38,32 --> 0:19:40,96
and see whether it's
been successful or not.


575
0:19:40,96 --> 0:19:43,78
And several times, we've seen
them change the name back.


576
0:19:43,78 --> 0:19:45,67
They reverted back
to their bad ways.


577
0:19:45,67 --> 0:19:47,43
Other people have
kept what you've


578
0:19:47,43 --> 0:19:48,68
done or remained successful.


579
0:19:48,68 --> 0:19:50,3
Can you kind of
talk about why is it


580
0:19:50,3 --> 0:19:51,79
that some have
reverted and failed,


581
0:19:51,79 --> 0:19:53,8
while others keep what
you've given them, et cetera.


582
0:19:53,8 --> 0:19:55,202
JON TAFFER: Yeah, good question.


583
0:19:55,202 --> 0:19:57,35
These people make
thousands of bad decisions


584
0:19:57,35 --> 0:19:58,466
that got me there.


585
0:19:58,466 --> 0:19:59,36
Right?


586
0:19:59,36 --> 0:20:1,49
Think of all the
choices that they


587
0:20:1,49 --> 0:20:4,58
made from hiring to
products to management


588
0:20:4,58 --> 0:20:7,55
to cause them to be in
the depth of failure


589
0:20:7,55 --> 0:20:9,9
that they're in when I show up.


590
0:20:9,9 --> 0:20:14,589
And my challenge is
to reverse that level


591
0:20:14,589 --> 0:20:16,5
of failure, that
depth of failure.


592
0:20:16,5 --> 0:20:17,55
I forgot your question.


593
0:20:17,55 --> 0:20:18,43
MALE SPEAKER: Oh,
it was just why


594
0:20:18,43 --> 0:20:20,44
do some revert back to their
old name and [INAUDIBLE].


595
0:20:20,44 --> 0:20:22,565
JON TAFFER: So what happens
is-- and I'll pick one.


596
0:20:22,565 --> 0:20:24,45
The Brixton in Austin, Texas.


597
0:20:24,45 --> 0:20:25,2
Remember that one?


598
0:20:25,2 --> 0:20:28,35
With the cocky husband--
they changed the name back


599
0:20:28,35 --> 0:20:29,33
a week later.


600
0:20:29,33 --> 0:20:30,74
But they kept everything else.


601
0:20:30,74 --> 0:20:32,16
They kept the
infusion cocktails.


602
0:20:32,16 --> 0:20:33,84
But they were hung
up on The Brixton.


603
0:20:33,84 --> 0:20:35,23
They're doing pretty well.


604
0:20:35,23 --> 0:20:37,3
But guys, you know this.


605
0:20:37,3 --> 0:20:40,99
If the Google name had
a terrible association


606
0:20:40,99 --> 0:20:43,64
with it and a reputation
for not delivering


607
0:20:43,64 --> 0:20:46,89
on the promises made, how much
advertising would you sell?


608
0:20:46,89 --> 0:20:48,43
So if I didn't
change the company,


609
0:20:48,43 --> 0:20:50,53
but put a new sign
on the building,


610
0:20:50,53 --> 0:20:52,85
at least I have a
chance at a new future.


611
0:20:52,85 --> 0:20:57,54
So, Swanky Bubbles--
remember that one?


612
0:20:57,54 --> 0:20:59,79
Who puts Swanky Bubbles
back on a building.


613
0:20:59,79 --> 0:21:2,9
You think you would thank
you for taking it down.


614
0:21:2,9 --> 0:21:4,21
But they changed the
name back the next day.


615
0:21:4,21 --> 0:21:6,76
And his logic was
it's confusing.


616
0:21:6,76 --> 0:21:10,25
My old customers won't
come to the new bar.


617
0:21:10,25 --> 0:21:12,31
You were losing money
with the old customers.


618
0:21:12,31 --> 0:21:14,624
And here's what they
don't understand.


619
0:21:14,624 --> 0:21:16,29
When they changed the
name back, they're


620
0:21:16,29 --> 0:21:18,7
thinking of the
customers they have.


621
0:21:18,7 --> 0:21:22,48
I'm trying to get them to
customers they don't have


622
0:21:22,48 --> 0:21:25,78
and the thousands of people that
they alienated and chased away.


623
0:21:25,78 --> 0:21:28,66
So with a new brand
comes a honeymoon.


624
0:21:28,66 --> 0:21:31,8
With a new brand comes
a whole new future.


625
0:21:31,8 --> 0:21:34,689
I have probably kept as
many brands as I've changed.


626
0:21:34,689 --> 0:21:36,73
So I don't just go in
there and change the brand.


627
0:21:36,73 --> 0:21:38,21
We do a lot of market research.


628
0:21:38,21 --> 0:21:39,41
I use Esri.


629
0:21:39,41 --> 0:21:41,0
And I do all my online research.


630
0:21:41,0 --> 0:21:43,551
By the way, "Bar Rescue"
is absolutely in real time.


631
0:21:43,551 --> 0:21:45,5
I should speak to
this for a moment.


632
0:21:45,5 --> 0:21:48,15
You know, the first day
I show up at about 4:35


633
0:21:48,15 --> 0:21:49,27
in the afternoon.


634
0:21:49,27 --> 0:21:51,291
I go in and do my
recon that night.


635
0:21:51,291 --> 0:21:53,54
When I leave the bar that
night, that day ends for me.


636
0:21:53,54 --> 0:21:54,456
I go back to my hotel.


637
0:21:54,456 --> 0:21:55,52
The next day is Day 2.


638
0:21:55,52 --> 0:21:57,19
We train, we have stress test.


639
0:21:57,19 --> 0:21:59,27
The next day is Day 3 training.


640
0:21:59,27 --> 0:22:2,37
At the end of Day 3,
at about 9 o'clock,


641
0:22:2,37 --> 0:22:4,35
I get the staff out
of there at night.


642
0:22:4,35 --> 0:22:7,6
And then we go to
work building the bar.


643
0:22:7,6 --> 0:22:9,71
We do it for a true 36 hours.


644
0:22:9,71 --> 0:22:12,71
So the evening of Day
3, the day of Day 4,


645
0:22:12,71 --> 0:22:15,51
and the morning of Day
5, we remodel the bar.


646
0:22:15,51 --> 0:22:18,15
And then I reveal
it to them on Day 5.


647
0:22:18,15 --> 0:22:21,245
It is absolutely in real
time, and not one word of it


648
0:22:21,245 --> 0:22:22,22
is scripted ever.


649
0:22:22,22 --> 0:22:24,56
Candidly, if it
was, I'd walk off.


650
0:22:24,56 --> 0:22:26,35
And I just won't do that.


651
0:22:26,35 --> 0:22:28,58
So it is incredibly real.


652
0:22:28,58 --> 0:22:31,99
And that's why the
casting, the selection


653
0:22:31,99 --> 0:22:34,45
of the bars and the
characters are so important,


654
0:22:34,45 --> 0:22:36,1
because I'm not
going to script it.


655
0:22:36,1 --> 0:22:36,78
And in "Bar


656
0:22:36,78 --> 0:22:40,1
Rescue," we use the phrase
"we work with what we have.


657
0:22:40,1 --> 0:22:42,68
We don't create
what we don't have."


658
0:22:42,68 --> 0:22:44,45
And it's working the moment.


659
0:22:44,45 --> 0:22:47,31
And we've gotten pretty good at
it, I think, after 59 of them


660
0:22:47,31 --> 0:22:48,12
or so.


661
0:22:48,12 --> 0:22:48,87
MALE SPEAKER: Man.


662
0:22:48,87 --> 0:22:52,54
So why did you decide
to write a book.


663
0:22:52,54 --> 0:22:54,22
JON TAFFER: I've been a
public speaker for 30 years.


664
0:22:54,22 --> 0:22:55,65
I love helping people.


665
0:22:55,65 --> 0:22:58,87
I can't tell you-- you know, I
tell people this story often.


666
0:22:58,87 --> 0:23:1,32
One of the greatest moments
in my life was an operator.


667
0:23:1,32 --> 0:23:3,45
When I opened Mall of
America, it had a dishwasher.


668
0:23:3,45 --> 0:23:5,28
His name was Theo.


669
0:23:5,28 --> 0:23:7,93
And this guy was a
dishwasher, almost


670
0:23:7,93 --> 0:23:10,58
a gang banger kind of
kid in Minneapolis.


671
0:23:10,58 --> 0:23:13,27
And my prep cook quit, and
I made him a prep cook.


672
0:23:13,27 --> 0:23:15,242
I liked this kid
for some reason.


673
0:23:15,242 --> 0:23:17,45
Then I'm opening another
restaurant six months later.


674
0:23:17,45 --> 0:23:19,93
And I pick a training
team from that restaurant


675
0:23:19,93 --> 0:23:21,58
and I fly them to another city.


676
0:23:21,58 --> 0:23:24,54
And I took Theo as
my prep cook trainee.


677
0:23:24,54 --> 0:23:27,5
And now we're in a hotel
meeting room, sort of like this.


678
0:23:27,5 --> 0:23:29,4
And all my training
team goes up in front


679
0:23:29,4 --> 0:23:31,63
of the staff to
introduce themselves.


680
0:23:31,63 --> 0:23:35,48
And Theo walks out there
in a shark skin suit,


681
0:23:35,48 --> 0:23:38,3
missing his teeth and
gold in the front,


682
0:23:38,3 --> 0:23:40,95
and says six months
ago, I was a dishwasher.


683
0:23:40,95 --> 0:23:42,85
And look at me today.


684
0:23:42,85 --> 0:23:44,16
And I cried.


685
0:23:44,16 --> 0:23:46,41
And I realized that was the
most important thing to me


686
0:23:46,41 --> 0:23:48,62
I could ever do.


687
0:23:48,62 --> 0:23:49,52
And I've been
fortunate in my life.


688
0:23:49,52 --> 0:23:50,8
I've made money.


689
0:23:50,8 --> 0:23:52,49
Now I want to make people.


690
0:23:52,49 --> 0:23:54,28
And I'm really inspired by that.


691
0:23:54,28 --> 0:23:55,75
And we talked
about this earlier,


692
0:23:55,75 --> 0:23:58,42
when people come up to me and
say they've gotten promoted,


693
0:23:58,42 --> 0:24:1,1
I've inspired them, they've
raised the bar, whatever


694
0:24:1,1 --> 0:24:3,5
it is it's an incredibly
motivating thing to me.


695
0:24:3,5 --> 0:24:5,88
So the book was an
effort to do that,


696
0:24:5,88 --> 0:24:9,8
to try to take what I do and
share it with more people,


697
0:24:9,8 --> 0:24:10,511
because I really believe in it.


698
0:24:10,511 --> 0:24:11,51
MALE SPEAKER: Very cool.


699
0:24:11,51 --> 0:24:14,9
And so your philosophy
of reaction management


700
0:24:14,9 --> 0:24:17,251
which you coined is kind of the
main theme throughout the book.


701
0:24:17,251 --> 0:24:19,5
Can you give everyone a quick
summary of what that is?


702
0:24:19,5 --> 0:24:21,11
JON TAFFER: Sure.


703
0:24:21,11 --> 0:24:22,942
First, let me explain
how it came about,


704
0:24:22,942 --> 0:24:24,9
because I don't cover it
very much in the book.


705
0:24:24,9 --> 0:24:27,108
When I was young, my mother
was incredibly difficult,


706
0:24:27,108 --> 0:24:28,49
a little violent.


707
0:24:28,49 --> 0:24:30,75
So when I was seven,
eight, nine, ten years old,


708
0:24:30,75 --> 0:24:34,545
I understood that if I
couldn't control her mood,


709
0:24:34,545 --> 0:24:36,99
I was going to
get my ass kicked.


710
0:24:36,99 --> 0:24:40,6
So at a very young age,
I learned the sensitivity


711
0:24:40,6 --> 0:24:43,67
to watch her face,
read her moods.


712
0:24:43,67 --> 0:24:49,51
And I developed this skill
to sense and feel people.


713
0:24:49,51 --> 0:24:52,12
Like your crossed arm, right?


714
0:24:52,12 --> 0:24:53,9
I would stare at you
and shake my head


715
0:24:53,9 --> 0:24:55,24
until those arms uncrossed.


716
0:24:55,24 --> 0:24:57,2
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]


717
0:24:57,2 --> 0:24:58,62
JON TAFFER: Same with you.


718
0:24:58,62 --> 0:25:1,309
I mean, I look at
everybody's body language.


719
0:25:1,309 --> 0:25:2,35
And I do it subliminally.


720
0:25:2,35 --> 0:25:4,7
I don't think about
it consciously.


721
0:25:4,7 --> 0:25:6,64
Your eye contact, your body
language, your energy level,


722
0:25:6,64 --> 0:25:7,58
your posture.


723
0:25:7,58 --> 0:25:9,65
And I read these things.


724
0:25:9,65 --> 0:25:11,7
And I figured out how
to manipulate you.


725
0:25:11,7 --> 0:25:13,44
And here's a philosophy.


726
0:25:13,44 --> 0:25:15,61
If you go into a
restaurant and you sit down


727
0:25:15,61 --> 0:25:16,81
and you order food.


728
0:25:16,81 --> 0:25:19,54
And the food comes to the table,
and it's put down on a table.


729
0:25:19,54 --> 0:25:21,998
When the plate hits the table--
and this could be anything.


730
0:25:21,998 --> 0:25:25,36
It could be a Google ad--
one of two things happens.


731
0:25:25,36 --> 0:25:30,59
Either the guest sits up, reacts
to it, or nothing happens.


732
0:25:30,59 --> 0:25:33,25
If nothing happens, we're
stuck in mediocrity the rest


733
0:25:33,25 --> 0:25:34,63
of our lives.


734
0:25:34,63 --> 0:25:37,42
Whether that's a Google Ad,
whether it's a plate of food,


735
0:25:37,42 --> 0:25:40,51
whether it's a song, whether
it's the color of a wall,


736
0:25:40,51 --> 0:25:46,58
nothing we do is anything other
than creating human reactions.


737
0:25:46,58 --> 0:25:49,26
When reactions go in the
direction we want them to,


738
0:25:49,26 --> 0:25:52,254
people write us
checks, don't they?


739
0:25:52,254 --> 0:25:53,92
They move to other
sides of the country.


740
0:25:53,92 --> 0:25:55,4
They take jobs.


741
0:25:55,4 --> 0:25:57,58
Everything changes,
when we can cause


742
0:25:57,58 --> 0:26:0,25
people to react in the
ways that we need to.


743
0:26:0,25 --> 0:26:3,448
So at a young age, I
developed this skill.


744
0:26:3,448 --> 0:26:5,156
And that's why I think
"Bar Rescue" works


745
0:26:5,156 --> 0:26:7,322
for me because I'm only
with these people five days.


746
0:26:7,322 --> 0:26:8,53
I got to read them quick.


747
0:26:8,53 --> 0:26:10,92
And we were talking earlier--
I mean, I'm people's faces,


748
0:26:10,92 --> 0:26:13,76
for sure-- but
there's a reason why.


749
0:26:13,76 --> 0:26:14,78
This might surprise you.


750
0:26:14,78 --> 0:26:16,69
I am never angry
on "Bar Rescue."


751
0:26:16,69 --> 0:26:18,66
It is completely calculated.


752
0:26:18,66 --> 0:26:20,31
It is completely deliberate.


753
0:26:20,31 --> 0:26:22,69
And we were talking, if
I wanted to pick on him,


754
0:26:22,69 --> 0:26:24,6
OK, this is a guy
with some pride.


755
0:26:24,6 --> 0:26:25,85
First, I'm going to try pride.


756
0:26:25,85 --> 0:26:27,23
Do you want to be a success?


757
0:26:27,23 --> 0:26:27,77
Do you want to be a failure?


758
0:26:27,77 --> 0:26:30,353
What are your parents going to
say when they see you faiiling?


759
0:26:30,353 --> 0:26:31,53
I'll try, that didn't work.


760
0:26:31,53 --> 0:26:32,512
Now, I'll try fear.


761
0:26:32,512 --> 0:26:33,845
You're going to lose everything!


762
0:26:33,845 --> 0:26:35,386
You're going to be
out in the street.


763
0:26:35,386 --> 0:26:37,0
What are you gon--
that didn't work.


764
0:26:37,0 --> 0:26:38,54
Picture your kids.


765
0:26:38,54 --> 0:26:39,9
Can you come true for your kids?


766
0:26:39,9 --> 0:26:40,71
That didn't work.


767
0:26:40,71 --> 0:26:42,779
Well, now I have
only one option.


768
0:26:42,779 --> 0:26:44,7
I'm going to rip you to shreds.


769
0:26:44,7 --> 0:26:45,39
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]


770
0:26:45,39 --> 0:26:48,27
JON TAFFER: Because
I have no choice.


771
0:26:48,27 --> 0:26:49,49
I have no choice.


772
0:26:49,49 --> 0:26:53,98
And here is "Bar Rescue" in
its most essence, if you will,


773
0:26:53,98 --> 0:26:55,59
right at the core.


774
0:26:55,59 --> 0:26:57,74
You're going to
dig your heels in.


775
0:26:57,74 --> 0:26:59,79
And you're not
going to let me in.


776
0:26:59,79 --> 0:27:1,6
You're going to get defensive.


777
0:27:1,6 --> 0:27:2,78
So I'm going to be in your face.


778
0:27:2,78 --> 0:27:6,31
I am going to be
relentless, until I


779
0:27:6,31 --> 0:27:9,74
can make you doubt
yourself for one second.


780
0:27:9,74 --> 0:27:11,57
And if I can make
you doubt yourself


781
0:27:11,57 --> 0:27:13,93
just a little for one
second, your brain opens


782
0:27:13,93 --> 0:27:16,1
and I walk right the hell in.


783
0:27:16,1 --> 0:27:17,6
And that's the way it is.


784
0:27:17,6 --> 0:27:20,49
I got to break you down and
make you doubt yourself.


785
0:27:20,49 --> 0:27:22,8
Because you're the
one who's wrong.


786
0:27:22,8 --> 0:27:24,56
You're the one losing money.


787
0:27:24,56 --> 0:27:25,68
I've got the bank
accounts to prove it.


788
0:27:25,68 --> 0:27:28,62
So I stand there with
this cocky, confidence.


789
0:27:28,62 --> 0:27:31,55
And I will beat and
beat and beat on you


790
0:27:31,55 --> 0:27:33,69
until that crap comes open.


791
0:27:33,69 --> 0:27:36,27
And then I walk in, and we
were talking before I started,


792
0:27:36,27 --> 0:27:38,63
the biggest fights
I have are always


793
0:27:38,63 --> 0:27:41,73
the biggest hugs at
the end, aren't they?


794
0:27:41,73 --> 0:27:43,83
So when you turn them,
you really turn them.


795
0:27:43,83 --> 0:27:45,41
It's an incredible
thing to watch.


796
0:27:45,41 --> 0:27:48,58
And they walk different
four days later.


797
0:27:48,58 --> 0:27:51,229
Once I crack through,
their posture's different.


798
0:27:51,229 --> 0:27:52,77
Their facial expression
is different.


799
0:27:52,77 --> 0:27:54,436
When you look in your
eye, you can truly


800
0:27:54,436 --> 0:27:56,83
see this human transformation.


801
0:27:56,83 --> 0:27:58,15
It's remarkable.


802
0:27:58,15 --> 0:28:0,34
And you see it on TV, but
it's even more evident


803
0:28:0,34 --> 0:28:1,322
when you're there.


804
0:28:1,322 --> 0:28:2,246
MALE SPEAKER: Right.


805
0:28:2,246 --> 0:28:3,17
Very cool.


806
0:28:3,17 --> 0:28:5,63
So a lot of people in this
room work in advertising.


807
0:28:5,63 --> 0:28:7,29
You talk about
advertising in the book.


808
0:28:7,29 --> 0:28:9,71
Can you talk about what
sort of advertising bars


809
0:28:9,71 --> 0:28:13,49
can do from digital to-- you
talk a lot about word of mouth


810
0:28:13,49 --> 0:28:15,54
too, whether that can
be something generated.


811
0:28:15,54 --> 0:28:16,27
JON TAFFER: Sure.


812
0:28:16,27 --> 0:28:18,811
Let me start by saying I come
from an advertising background.


813
0:28:18,811 --> 0:28:21,41
My grandfather
invented Direct Mail.


814
0:28:21,41 --> 0:28:24,31
And gets credit for inventing
Direct Mail in Brooklyn, New


815
0:28:24,31 --> 0:28:24,81
York.


816
0:28:24,81 --> 0:28:27,72
When he was 16 years old,
he bought a printing press,


817
0:28:27,72 --> 0:28:29,455
and started putting
fliers in newspaper


818
0:28:29,455 --> 0:28:31,774
at the newspaper
stand on the corner.


819
0:28:31,774 --> 0:28:33,19
And then he walked
down the street


820
0:28:33,19 --> 0:28:35,34
and wrote down the
names in the mailboxes


821
0:28:35,34 --> 0:28:37,16
and started leaving
flyers in the apartment


822
0:28:37,16 --> 0:28:38,72
buildings in Brooklyn.


823
0:28:38,72 --> 0:28:41,7
And then, he started
getting and mailing them


824
0:28:41,7 --> 0:28:43,15
from this little
storefront that he had.


825
0:28:43,15 --> 0:28:45,24
And one of the largest
ad companies in the world


826
0:28:45,24 --> 0:28:47,9
knew we were advertising,
bought my grandfather's


827
0:28:47,9 --> 0:28:50,78
little storefront
operation, brought him in.


828
0:28:50,78 --> 0:28:53,78
The term Direct
Marketing was invented.


829
0:28:53,78 --> 0:28:57,45
And my grandfather then
created the entire direct


830
0:28:57,45 --> 0:28:58,98
marketing/direct mail.


831
0:28:58,98 --> 0:29:1,56
And my family has done
the direct marketing


832
0:29:1,56 --> 0:29:3,96
for Volvo, Mercedes Benz,
and a bunch of companies


833
0:29:3,96 --> 0:29:5,74
now for three generations.


834
0:29:5,74 --> 0:29:7,47
So I come from a
marketing background.


835
0:29:7,47 --> 0:29:8,71
It's in my blood.


836
0:29:8,71 --> 0:29:12,601
And to me, marketing is
just human reactions.


837
0:29:12,601 --> 0:29:13,1
Period.


838
0:29:13,1 --> 0:29:13,78
End the discussion.


839
0:29:13,78 --> 0:29:14,39
We don't do ads.


840
0:29:14,39 --> 0:29:15,33
We do human reactions.


841
0:29:15,33 --> 0:29:17,31
We achieve them through ads.


842
0:29:17,31 --> 0:29:18,56
I don't even make phone calls.


843
0:29:18,56 --> 0:29:19,601
I create human reactions.


844
0:29:19,601 --> 0:29:20,9
I do it on the phone.


845
0:29:20,9 --> 0:29:22,53
The fact of the
matter is everything


846
0:29:22,53 --> 0:29:24,3
I do-- no different
than this moment


847
0:29:24,3 --> 0:29:27,57
right now-- if I don't
create reactions, I fail.


848
0:29:27,57 --> 0:29:29,0
Period, and so do you.


849
0:29:29,0 --> 0:29:30,41
So it's a way of life.


850
0:29:30,41 --> 0:29:33,44
You study every facial
expression, every inflection


851
0:29:33,44 --> 0:29:37,21
in voices, everything
to manipulate you


852
0:29:37,21 --> 0:29:39,252
for me to get your check.


853
0:29:39,252 --> 0:29:41,71
I have no guilt doing that,
because I know when you give me


854
0:29:41,71 --> 0:29:43,96
a check, I'm going to come
through for you in the end.


855
0:29:43,96 --> 0:29:44,88
That's the trick.


856
0:29:44,88 --> 0:29:47,532
When you know you're doing
right you can fight harder.


857
0:29:47,532 --> 0:29:48,99
You got to know
you're doing right.


858
0:29:48,99 --> 0:29:50,285
You guys do right here.


859
0:29:50,285 --> 0:29:51,56
You're a great company.


860
0:29:51,56 --> 0:29:53,51
I advertise on Google myself.


861
0:29:53,51 --> 0:29:57,27
But I've learned that if an
ad doesn't create a reaction,


862
0:29:57,27 --> 0:29:58,38
it's worthless.


863
0:29:58,38 --> 0:30:0,76
And where we blow
it, in that business,


864
0:30:0,76 --> 0:30:4,6
is when we take advertising
dollars from a client


865
0:30:4,6 --> 0:30:7,21
and place an ad that we know
is not going to get a reaction,


866
0:30:7,21 --> 0:30:8,47
that we know is going to fail.


867
0:30:8,47 --> 0:30:9,38
We don't serve them.


868
0:30:9,38 --> 0:30:10,338
We don't get a renewal.


869
0:30:10,338 --> 0:30:13,4
We don't serve our
ourselves and our company.


870
0:30:13,4 --> 0:30:16,97
So the end result is you
guys have to create reactions


871
0:30:16,97 --> 0:30:18,79
from the advertising
that you do.


872
0:30:18,79 --> 0:30:21,31
Or you're never going
to grow that business.


873
0:30:21,31 --> 0:30:24,82
So you're as much in the
reaction business as I am.


874
0:30:24,82 --> 0:30:25,93
MALE SPEAKER: Right.


875
0:30:25,93 --> 0:30:26,46
Very cool.


876
0:30:26,46 --> 0:30:29,422
And so a lot of us,
we love the parts


877
0:30:29,422 --> 0:30:31,63
of the show when you really
dig deep into the science


878
0:30:31,63 --> 0:30:33,879
behind the bar, the science
of everything that you do.


879
0:30:33,879 --> 0:30:36,49
And it's all to increase
workplace efficiency


880
0:30:36,49 --> 0:30:37,69
and whatnot.


881
0:30:37,69 --> 0:30:39,94
Google prides itself on
trying to do the same things.


882
0:30:39,94 --> 0:30:42,23
So what are some
of the sciences you


883
0:30:42,23 --> 0:30:44,105
learned to optimize for
workplace efficiency.


884
0:30:44,105 --> 0:30:46,271
JON TAFFER: You know, there's
a lot of things to it.


885
0:30:46,271 --> 0:30:47,78
And I want to
reiterate the question


886
0:30:47,78 --> 0:30:48,54
that you asked me before.


887
0:30:48,54 --> 0:30:50,4
You asked me about
social marketing,


888
0:30:50,4 --> 0:30:51,9
and I didn't mention it.


889
0:30:51,9 --> 0:30:53,4
You know, social marketing
is a big word today.


890
0:30:53,4 --> 0:30:54,59
And everybody does it.


891
0:30:54,59 --> 0:30:56,58
But who does it well?


892
0:30:56,58 --> 0:30:57,93
Not too many.


893
0:30:57,93 --> 0:30:59,35
It's a new science.


894
0:30:59,35 --> 0:31:1,2
We're still figuring
it out ourselves.


895
0:31:1,2 --> 0:31:4,21
I mean, just because I have
100,000 Twitter followers,


896
0:31:4,21 --> 0:31:5,919
how do I monetize that?


897
0:31:5,919 --> 0:31:7,21
How do I motivate these people?


898
0:31:7,21 --> 0:31:8,215
What is it?


899
0:31:8,215 --> 0:31:8,84
Is it an event?


900
0:31:8,84 --> 0:31:9,73
Is it a discount?


901
0:31:9,73 --> 0:31:12,36
I mean, what is it
that causes people


902
0:31:12,36 --> 0:31:13,86
to-- and I'm going
to use my word--


903
0:31:13,86 --> 0:31:16,22
react to my social marketing?


904
0:31:16,22 --> 0:31:17,49
No reaction, no dollars.


905
0:31:17,49 --> 0:31:18,96
No reaction, no win.


906
0:31:18,96 --> 0:31:21,11
So where people
blow it is they go


907
0:31:21,11 --> 0:31:24,29
through the mechanics
of social marketing.


908
0:31:24,29 --> 0:31:26,5
They go through the
mechanics of advertising,


909
0:31:26,5 --> 0:31:30,494
but they never really focus
on "where are the reactions?"


910
0:31:30,494 --> 0:31:31,66
And here's the way I say it.


911
0:31:31,66 --> 0:31:33,14
And I'm trying to be short.


912
0:31:33,14 --> 0:31:35,96
You know, in the real world,
when a big company goes


913
0:31:35,96 --> 0:31:38,51
to an ad agency,
and the ad agency


914
0:31:38,51 --> 0:31:39,86
provides all the creative.


915
0:31:39,86 --> 0:31:43,18
If you like the creative,
you buy the advertising.


916
0:31:43,18 --> 0:31:46,25
If you don't like the creative,
you don't buy the advertising.


917
0:31:46,25 --> 0:31:47,34
Bar business?


918
0:31:47,34 --> 0:31:48,2
Opposite.


919
0:31:48,2 --> 0:31:51,5
We buy the advertising
with no creative,


920
0:31:51,5 --> 0:31:53,5
and then at the last
minute we get a phone call.


921
0:31:53,5 --> 0:31:54,9
I need your copy.


922
0:31:54,9 --> 0:31:55,14
Oh, oh!


923
0:31:55,14 --> 0:31:57,21
And so the fact of
the matter is we


924
0:31:57,21 --> 0:31:59,2
go at it in a mechanical way.


925
0:31:59,2 --> 0:32:0,59
And that's what you can't do.


926
0:32:0,59 --> 0:32:3,69
You've got to make certain that
those reactions are created.


927
0:32:3,69 --> 0:32:6,25
The words, the phrasing,
the fonts, the color,


928
0:32:6,25 --> 0:32:8,79
the positioning--
these are subliminals


929
0:32:8,79 --> 0:32:12,49
that will either somebody
to click through or not.


930
0:32:12,49 --> 0:32:15,4
And you are a point
of difference.


931
0:32:15,4 --> 0:32:16,92
You guys stand alone.


932
0:32:16,92 --> 0:32:18,88
You're the shining
star in the business.


933
0:32:18,88 --> 0:32:20,86
Nobody lights a candle to you.


934
0:32:20,86 --> 0:32:21,74
Bing?


935
0:32:21,74 --> 0:32:22,51
Come on.


936
0:32:22,51 --> 0:32:24,23
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]


937
0:32:24,23 --> 0:32:26,28
JON TAFFER: The fact
that the matter is now


938
0:32:26,28 --> 0:32:30,947
because you are perceived as
so good at what you do, so big,


939
0:32:30,947 --> 0:32:32,3
the bar is high, isn't it?


940
0:32:32,3 --> 0:32:34,6
Now I expect more
from you, which


941
0:32:34,6 --> 0:32:37,25
means as we get bigger and
better and our reputation


942
0:32:37,25 --> 0:32:39,27
grows, we've got to
deliver stronger.


943
0:32:39,27 --> 0:32:40,89
So the problem with
social marketing


944
0:32:40,89 --> 0:32:43,69
is an absence of
creative generally.


945
0:32:43,69 --> 0:32:46,22
It's become more
mechanical, more logistical,


946
0:32:46,22 --> 0:32:47,44
very uncreative.


947
0:32:47,44 --> 0:32:49,487
And some of it is because
it's in real time.


948
0:32:49,487 --> 0:32:51,57
In a newspaper ad, you
plan a month ahead of time,


949
0:32:51,57 --> 0:32:52,46
two months ahead of time.


950
0:32:52,46 --> 0:32:53,71
You work on your copy work.


951
0:32:53,71 --> 0:32:55,459
Social marketing, I
come up with it today.


952
0:32:55,459 --> 0:32:56,76
I put it online in 10 minutes.


953
0:32:56,76 --> 0:32:58,77
There is no planning.


954
0:32:58,77 --> 0:33:1,44
And the real time nature of
it sometimes works against us.


955
0:33:1,44 --> 0:33:4,7
And then here's the
ultimate kicker.


956
0:33:4,7 --> 0:33:5,58
When I hit you with
social marketing


957
0:33:5,58 --> 0:33:8,45
three or four times
in a row and blow it,


958
0:33:8,45 --> 0:33:10,85
you're going to delete me
every time for then on.


959
0:33:10,85 --> 0:33:12,82
I'll never get you back.


960
0:33:12,82 --> 0:33:14,32
So we only have one shot.


961
0:33:14,32 --> 0:33:15,7
I believe in social marketing.


962
0:33:15,7 --> 0:33:17,14
Either we engage the audience.


963
0:33:17,14 --> 0:33:18,64
Either we connect
with the audience.


964
0:33:18,64 --> 0:33:21,45
Or we alienate the
audience and we will never


965
0:33:21,45 --> 0:33:22,71
connect with them after that.


966
0:33:22,71 --> 0:33:24,609
And that's what my
experiences are.


967
0:33:24,609 --> 0:33:25,4
MALE SPEAKER: Nice.


968
0:33:25,4 --> 0:33:27,31
And some of the
big shock moments


969
0:33:27,31 --> 0:33:28,79
of the show and
when fire people.


970
0:33:28,79 --> 0:33:31,28
And sometimes you get in their
face and you throw them out.


971
0:33:31,28 --> 0:33:32,78
Other times, you're sympathetic.


972
0:33:32,78 --> 0:33:34,68
You're like, sorry,
I have to let you go.


973
0:33:34,68 --> 0:33:37,55
So how do you choose
like you're going to fire


974
0:33:37,55 --> 0:33:38,316
and how you do it?


975
0:33:38,316 --> 0:33:39,815
And you're welcome
to practice on me


976
0:33:39,815 --> 0:33:42,42
if you want to fire me
[INAUDIBLE] interview.


977
0:33:42,42 --> 0:33:44,4
JON TAFFER: Well,
you know, when you


978
0:33:44,4 --> 0:33:47,24
were talking earlier about
general marketing sciences.


979
0:33:47,24 --> 0:33:49,82
The bar business is very visual.


980
0:33:49,82 --> 0:33:53,26
I need to move your eye
where I needed to go.


981
0:33:53,26 --> 0:33:56,65
First, I sell with the eye, then
I get my hand into your pocket.


982
0:33:56,65 --> 0:33:59,0
So I say, with the
exterior building.


983
0:33:59,0 --> 0:34:1,762
If I don't pull your eye, I'm
not going to pull your body.


984
0:34:1,762 --> 0:34:2,97
The front door of a business.


985
0:34:2,97 --> 0:34:5,41
If I don't pull your eye, I'm
not going to pull your body.


986
0:34:5,41 --> 0:34:7,56
In a Google ad, if I
don't pull your eye,


987
0:34:7,56 --> 0:34:9,409
the copy doesn't mean anything.


988
0:34:9,409 --> 0:34:10,949
So the fact of
the matter is I've


989
0:34:10,949 --> 0:34:13,48
got to connect and pull you in.


990
0:34:13,48 --> 0:34:14,929
And there's all
sorts of sciences.


991
0:34:14,929 --> 0:34:17,12
When you walk in the
front door of a business,


992
0:34:17,12 --> 0:34:19,889
your eyes are going to go to the
most colorful or brightest spot


993
0:34:19,889 --> 0:34:20,63
in a room.


994
0:34:20,63 --> 0:34:21,449
Every time.


995
0:34:21,449 --> 0:34:22,77
End of discussion.


996
0:34:22,77 --> 0:34:25,11
So some designer puts a
beautiful piece of artwork


997
0:34:25,11 --> 0:34:25,61
on the wall.


998
0:34:25,61 --> 0:34:26,79
I'm not making money off that.


999
0:34:26,79 --> 0:34:27,29
No!


1000
0:34:27,29 --> 0:34:28,79
Put the artwork over there.


1001
0:34:28,79 --> 0:34:32,886
I'm putting what I make money
on, where the eye falls.


1002
0:34:32,886 --> 0:34:34,26
So one of the
things that do is I


1003
0:34:34,26 --> 0:34:36,469
work very hard on
changing eye movement when


1004
0:34:36,469 --> 0:34:37,8
you walk through the door.


1005
0:34:37,8 --> 0:34:40,31
I also know that bars
are about meeting people.


1006
0:34:40,31 --> 0:34:41,79
Eye contact.


1007
0:34:41,79 --> 0:34:44,56
So at zero level, in a
bar when it's unelevated,


1008
0:34:44,56 --> 0:34:46,7
everybody's at high seating.


1009
0:34:46,7 --> 0:34:48,38
So everybody's eyes are within
10 inches of each other,


1010
0:34:48,38 --> 0:34:51,3
whether you're standing
or sitting in a bar stool.


1011
0:34:51,3 --> 0:34:55,138
When people connect, the
magic of a bar happens.


1012
0:34:55,138 --> 0:34:56,929
But you've got to look
at each other's eyes


1013
0:34:56,929 --> 0:34:58,6
or it never starts.


1014
0:34:58,6 --> 0:35:0,62
So in elevated areas
in bars, there's


1015
0:35:0,62 --> 0:35:1,95
a lot of science to this.


1016
0:35:1,95 --> 0:35:5,61
If I have one staircase on
an elevation in a bar, what


1017
0:35:5,61 --> 0:35:7,36
happens is you see a
pretty girl up there.


1018
0:35:7,36 --> 0:35:10,76
So you go up the steps, you
walk, you hit a dead end.


1019
0:35:10,76 --> 0:35:12,4
You feel like an idiot.


1020
0:35:12,4 --> 0:35:13,62
You got to turn around
and go back the other way.


1021
0:35:13,62 --> 0:35:15,286
And she knows exactly
what you're doing.


1022
0:35:15,286 --> 0:35:16,91
So you never go up there again.


1023
0:35:16,91 --> 0:35:20,23
But with two staircases, I
walk through with a purpose


1024
0:35:20,23 --> 0:35:21,77
and go out the other side.


1025
0:35:21,77 --> 0:35:26,214
So it's totally manipulative
in every conceivable way.


1026
0:35:26,214 --> 0:35:27,88
I want to manipulate
where your eyes go,


1027
0:35:27,88 --> 0:35:30,5
which way you go, where
you sit, where you stand.


1028
0:35:30,5 --> 0:35:32,69
And here's the trick
to the bar business.


1029
0:35:32,69 --> 0:35:34,377
You can make drinks
at home, can't you?


1030
0:35:34,377 --> 0:35:35,71
You don't need me for cocktails.


1031
0:35:35,71 --> 0:35:38,8
You can make exactly
what you want.


1032
0:35:38,8 --> 0:35:39,66
In today's world,
the technology--


1033
0:35:39,66 --> 0:35:42,5
we can get exactly the
programming that I want,


1034
0:35:42,5 --> 0:35:45,8
musically, video,
satellite, online.


1035
0:35:45,8 --> 0:35:48,3
I have every entertainment
option and everything


1036
0:35:48,3 --> 0:35:50,46
I could ever want at home.


1037
0:35:50,46 --> 0:35:51,71
I don't need you for drinks.


1038
0:35:51,71 --> 0:35:53,44
I don't need you
for entertainment.


1039
0:35:53,44 --> 0:35:56,17
There's one thing that you
can't get at home that I have.


1040
0:35:56,17 --> 0:35:57,83
And that's social interaction.


1041
0:35:57,83 --> 0:35:59,74
That's my calling card.


1042
0:35:59,74 --> 0:36:2,9
And if I create socially
interactive environments,


1043
0:36:2,9 --> 0:36:3,3
people come back.


1044
0:36:3,3 --> 0:36:5,765
And that's where these sciences
play in of height and eye


1045
0:36:5,765 --> 0:36:7,14
movement and all
of these things.


1046
0:36:7,14 --> 0:36:9,27
It's all about
creating interaction.


1047
0:36:9,27 --> 0:36:9,86
MALE SPEAKER: Great.


1048
0:36:9,86 --> 0:36:11,22
So we'll do one last question.


1049
0:36:11,22 --> 0:36:13,303
And then we'll open up to
the floor for questions.


1050
0:36:13,303 --> 0:36:16,229
So you just finished
Season 3 of "Bar Rescue."


1051
0:36:16,229 --> 0:36:17,27
You just wrote your book.


1052
0:36:17,27 --> 0:36:19,13
What is next for Jon Taffer?


1053
0:36:19,13 --> 0:36:21,37
I have a new show I'm
starting in February


1054
0:36:21,37 --> 0:36:23,33
called "The Hungry Investor."


1055
0:36:23,33 --> 0:36:26,54
And I describe it as a
cross between "Bar Rescue,"


1056
0:36:26,54 --> 0:36:30,91
"Hell's Kitchen,"
and "Shark Tank."


1057
0:36:30,91 --> 0:36:33,38
Myself and two
partners are traveling


1058
0:36:33,38 --> 0:36:36,95
around the country looking
for businesses to invest in.


1059
0:36:36,95 --> 0:36:38,89
So let's say, we decide
we want to invest


1060
0:36:38,89 --> 0:36:41,7
in steak houses or
any business-- sushi,


1061
0:36:41,7 --> 0:36:42,8
whatever it might be.


1062
0:36:42,8 --> 0:36:46,59
So we might come to LA,
pick two steak houses


1063
0:36:46,59 --> 0:36:48,28
that we might want to invest in.


1064
0:36:48,28 --> 0:36:51,235
And I created this formula
called an Invest Test. where


1065
0:36:51,235 --> 0:36:54,47
we determine the elasticity
and potential of the business


1066
0:36:54,47 --> 0:36:55,76
and individuals in it.


1067
0:36:55,76 --> 0:37:0,2
So we run them through this
rigorous and best test process


1068
0:37:0,2 --> 0:37:2,462
to determine there in
your business's potential.


1069
0:37:2,462 --> 0:37:3,92
And then at the
end of the show, we


1070
0:37:3,92 --> 0:37:5,73
determine which one we're
going to invest in it,


1071
0:37:5,73 --> 0:37:6,71
and we give him the money.


1072
0:37:6,71 --> 0:37:7,69
And we make the investment.


1073
0:37:7,69 --> 0:37:9,27
And then we let you
know how it did.


1074
0:37:9,27 --> 0:37:14,23
So it's much more business
return on investment, equity,


1075
0:37:14,23 --> 0:37:15,27
a little deeper for me.


1076
0:37:15,27 --> 0:37:15,978
It's sort of fun.


1077
0:37:15,978 --> 0:37:18,44
It allows me to show my
business knowledge, not just


1078
0:37:18,44 --> 0:37:19,525
my bar knowledge.


1079
0:37:19,525 --> 0:37:20,4
I'm excited about it.


1080
0:37:20,4 --> 0:37:22,54
Then "Bar Rescue,"
I told you we just


1081
0:37:22,54 --> 0:37:24,13
got picked up just yesterday.


1082
0:37:24,13 --> 0:37:26,91
20 more episodes
for us is Season 5.


1083
0:37:26,91 --> 0:37:28,5
So I'm very excited about that.


1084
0:37:28,5 --> 0:37:29,75
MALE SPEAKER: Congratulations.


1085
0:37:29,75 --> 0:37:33,314
JON TAFFER: I just finished
my 59th episode yesterday.


1086
0:37:33,314 --> 0:37:34,16
MALE SPEAKER: Great.


1087
0:37:34,16 --> 0:37:35,53
All right, let's
open it to questions.


1088
0:37:35,53 --> 0:37:37,613
And there's actually a
microphone right over there


1089
0:37:37,613 --> 0:37:39,11
that we can--


1090
0:37:39,11 --> 0:37:41,367
AUDIENCE: So if you had
a room full of people,


1091
0:37:41,367 --> 0:37:43,45
what would you tell them
in a brief period of time


1092
0:37:43,45 --> 0:37:45,45
to keep them from ever
showing up on your show?


1093
0:37:45,45 --> 0:37:48,43



1094
0:37:48,43 --> 0:37:49,91
JON TAFFER: No excuses.


1095
0:37:49,91 --> 0:37:52,11
If I had to leave
you with one message,


1096
0:37:52,11 --> 0:37:54,5
it's understanding that
all I'm going to do


1097
0:37:54,5 --> 0:37:56,33
is identify where
you're failing.


1098
0:37:56,33 --> 0:37:57,956
You can do that too if you want.


1099
0:37:57,956 --> 0:37:59,33
But you got to
look at the mirror


1100
0:37:59,33 --> 0:38:1,89
and say I'm failing because of
me-- what am I doing wrong--


1101
0:38:1,89 --> 0:38:2,89
And pick it apart.


1102
0:38:2,89 --> 0:38:4,473
The other thing about
the bar business


1103
0:38:4,473 --> 0:38:9,167
is I've seen a lot of bars not
fail, but run out of money.


1104
0:38:9,167 --> 0:38:10,5
They would've turned the corner.


1105
0:38:10,5 --> 0:38:12,291
The first restaurant
I ever owned by myself


1106
0:38:12,291 --> 0:38:13,86
was called Alamo Grill.


1107
0:38:13,86 --> 0:38:14,82
Actually, second one.


1108
0:38:14,82 --> 0:38:16,33
And Lynn Dickey was the first.


1109
0:38:16,33 --> 0:38:19,81
And I opened it, and
about 90 days into it,


1110
0:38:19,81 --> 0:38:21,25
I ran out of money.


1111
0:38:21,25 --> 0:38:23,566
I was losing money
in Mall of America.


1112
0:38:23,566 --> 0:38:25,19
And it's because it
was a new business,


1113
0:38:25,19 --> 0:38:29,19
and we were so busy that I
couldn't make it profitable.


1114
0:38:29,19 --> 0:38:30,62
So I was in trouble.


1115
0:38:30,62 --> 0:38:33,6
So I went and sold
50% of this business


1116
0:38:33,6 --> 0:38:36,84
that I put a million
dollars in for $150,000


1117
0:38:36,84 --> 0:38:38,6
to get the money I needed.


1118
0:38:38,6 --> 0:38:42,42
That year, that business
profited $800,000,


1119
0:38:42,42 --> 0:38:45,845
and somebody else owned
half of it for $150,000.


1120
0:38:45,845 --> 0:38:47,22
It's almost like
a football game.


1121
0:38:47,22 --> 0:38:49,22
Vince Lombardi once said,
I never lose the game.


1122
0:38:49,22 --> 0:38:50,66
I just run out of time.


1123
0:38:50,66 --> 0:38:52,31
That's very much
the bar business.


1124
0:38:52,31 --> 0:38:54,86
If you just had the money
for another month or two,


1125
0:38:54,86 --> 0:38:57,3
you could've figured
it out and made it.


1126
0:38:57,3 --> 0:38:59,942
And the problem with the bar
business is it's all rookies.


1127
0:38:59,942 --> 0:39:2,4
There's no place where you'd
go and learn the bar business.


1128
0:39:2,4 --> 0:39:3,566
There's hospitality schools.


1129
0:39:3,566 --> 0:39:5,71
There's no bar school.


1130
0:39:5,71 --> 0:39:9,88
So the bar sciences that
I teach-- Google it!


1131
0:39:9,88 --> 0:39:11,844
There's nobody else who
teaches these things.


1132
0:39:11,844 --> 0:39:13,51
There's no other books
with these things


1133
0:39:13,51 --> 0:39:15,18
that teach these sciences.


1134
0:39:15,18 --> 0:39:19,1
So the fact of the matter is I'm
a little unique in what I do,


1135
0:39:19,1 --> 0:39:22,4
but every bar can be
successful, if they just


1136
0:39:22,4 --> 0:39:23,65
changed what they do.


1137
0:39:23,65 --> 0:39:26,28
And I'll leave you with
a quote from, I believe,


1138
0:39:26,28 --> 0:39:27,445
Benjamin Franklin.


1139
0:39:27,445 --> 0:39:29,46
It says "if you do tomorrow,
what you did today,


1140
0:39:29,46 --> 0:39:31,68
you'll get tomorrow
which you got today."


1141
0:39:31,68 --> 0:39:34,15
I got to make them do
something different tomorrow.


1142
0:39:34,15 --> 0:39:35,18
So do they.


1143
0:39:35,18 --> 0:39:37,87
And the strange thing is they
could do that without me.


1144
0:39:37,87 --> 0:39:39,75
But the problem is they
blame the president,


1145
0:39:39,75 --> 0:39:43,37
they blame Congress, they blame
everything else but themselves.


1146
0:39:43,37 --> 0:39:45,44
And then they go home,
mad at somebody else.


1147
0:39:45,44 --> 0:39:48,962
I suggest you should go
home mad at yourself.


1148
0:39:48,962 --> 0:39:50,379
MALE SPEAKER: Great
Next question.


1149
0:39:50,379 --> 0:39:52,878
AUDIENCE: Where did you get a
lot of the data and statistics


1150
0:39:52,878 --> 0:39:54,58
you use, such as
if you serve food,


1151
0:39:54,58 --> 0:39:56,32
someone stays 45 minutes longer.


1152
0:39:56,32 --> 0:39:58,69
If you have neon lights, they
leave 30 minutes earlier.


1153
0:39:58,69 --> 0:40:0,7
Where do you get that data?


1154
0:40:0,7 --> 0:40:1,25
JON TAFFER: Some of
that is industrial.


1155
0:40:1,25 --> 0:40:3,416
For example, the fluorescent
lighting is industrial.


1156
0:40:3,416 --> 0:40:6,492
It was actually a study done
by General Motors years ago,


1157
0:40:6,492 --> 0:40:8,75
where they changed
florescent lighting


1158
0:40:8,75 --> 0:40:9,27
to incandescent lighting.


1159
0:40:9,27 --> 0:40:10,35
And illnesses went down.


1160
0:40:10,35 --> 0:40:12,2
And employee
productivity went up.


1161
0:40:12,2 --> 0:40:15,52
And I own a company
called GuestProbe.


1162
0:40:15,52 --> 0:40:17,59
And it's not a company
that I promote publicly,


1163
0:40:17,59 --> 0:40:21,59
but I have over my 30 years,
I have these databases


1164
0:40:21,59 --> 0:40:24,58
with 60,000 restaurants
and bars worth of data,


1165
0:40:24,58 --> 0:40:27,77
where I've done these
surveys and focus groups.


1166
0:40:27,77 --> 0:40:31,33
So most of this data is owned by
me, really, and created by me.


1167
0:40:31,33 --> 0:40:32,73
It's a little unique.


1168
0:40:32,73 --> 0:40:35,0
And it's not out
there any place else.


1169
0:40:35,0 --> 0:40:37,71
So for me, I know
it's 52 minutes,


1170
0:40:37,71 --> 0:40:39,58
because I've tracked
it for 30 years.


1171
0:40:39,58 --> 0:40:41,969
Nobody else has.


1172
0:40:41,969 --> 0:40:43,51
I wish I had a better
answer for you.


1173
0:40:43,51 --> 0:40:45,3
But that's the reality of it to.


1174
0:40:45,3 --> 0:40:47,44
They're my own sciences
that I test and work.


1175
0:40:47,44 --> 0:40:50,3
And they work every
time for me, as you see.


1176
0:40:50,3 --> 0:40:51,61
When I push the
buttons, it happens.


1177
0:40:51,61 --> 0:40:55,75
Science is science, but I'm the
nutcase who does this stuff.


1178
0:40:55,75 --> 0:40:56,48
And I am.


1179
0:40:56,48 --> 0:40:58,16
I'm a nutcase on this stuff.


1180
0:40:58,16 --> 0:41:1,3
I will spend a fortune
to build a video camera


1181
0:41:1,3 --> 0:41:3,3
in the corner behind
a piece of mirror,


1182
0:41:3,3 --> 0:41:6,16
just so that I can
monitor posture.


1183
0:41:6,16 --> 0:41:7,77
When I open a new
bar or restaurant,


1184
0:41:7,77 --> 0:41:11,757
I put a girl in the ladies'
room in a stall with a notepad.


1185
0:41:11,757 --> 0:41:13,59
And she sits in there
for an hour and a half


1186
0:41:13,59 --> 0:41:15,335
because what you guys say
to each other at the mirror


1187
0:41:15,335 --> 0:41:16,15
is gospel.


1188
0:41:16,15 --> 0:41:17,9
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]


1189
0:41:17,9 --> 0:41:19,101
JON TAFFER: I want to know.


1190
0:41:19,101 --> 0:41:21,1
I want to know what you're
saying to each other.


1191
0:41:21,1 --> 0:41:22,4
When do you think of my food?


1192
0:41:22,4 --> 0:41:23,17
What do you think
of my environment?


1193
0:41:23,17 --> 0:41:24,461
Do you think the place is safe?


1194
0:41:24,461 --> 0:41:26,2
Do you like the other customers?


1195
0:41:26,2 --> 0:41:27,72
I need to know.


1196
0:41:27,72 --> 0:41:31,23
I have this insatiable
addictive need


1197
0:41:31,23 --> 0:41:33,86
to know what's going
on in your brain.


1198
0:41:33,86 --> 0:41:37,83
So I use every trick in the
book to get to that information.


1199
0:41:37,83 --> 0:41:40,73
So it's 30-year, $60,000
restaurants worth of data.


1200
0:41:40,73 --> 0:41:43,61
It's actually a
really neat database,


1201
0:41:43,61 --> 0:41:47,75
even down to the color of
plates, flow patterns, hours,


1202
0:41:47,75 --> 0:41:50,64
price, points, for example,
psychological pricing.


1203
0:41:50,64 --> 0:41:53,19
And there's no difference
in guest perception


1204
0:41:53,19 --> 0:41:56,1
from $8.25 or $8.95.


1205
0:41:56,1 --> 0:41:57,66
Absolutely zero.


1206
0:41:57,66 --> 0:42:1,89
So if you charge $8.25 instead
of $8.95, you're leaving what?


1207
0:42:1,89 --> 0:42:5,71
60 cents on a table every
time you create a transaction.


1208
0:42:5,71 --> 0:42:8,17
So I can go into a bar, just
change the pricing from $8.50


1209
0:42:8,17 --> 0:42:11,56
to $8.95 on all the menu
items, move some stuff around,


1210
0:42:11,56 --> 0:42:15,36
not change one recipe and
increase revenues by about 20%.


1211
0:42:15,36 --> 0:42:16,71
So that's the science.


1212
0:42:16,71 --> 0:42:19,9
I can box something in
the center of a menu


1213
0:42:19,9 --> 0:42:23,73
and sales of that item will
go up 20% every single time.


1214
0:42:23,73 --> 0:42:25,89
If I bold it, put
Chef's Special on it,


1215
0:42:25,89 --> 0:42:29,59
sales would go up 14% to
17% every single time.


1216
0:42:29,59 --> 0:42:32,34
People have a 6.5%
propensity to order


1217
0:42:32,34 --> 0:42:36,16
the top bottom and bottom two
items on the list on a menu.


1218
0:42:36,16 --> 0:42:37,3
So what am I going to do?


1219
0:42:37,3 --> 0:42:39,14
I'm going to take my
most profitable item,


1220
0:42:39,14 --> 0:42:42,23
box it, shadow it, move it
all around, move it at $8.95,


1221
0:42:42,23 --> 0:42:45,3
and manipulate you to buy
what I'm making money on.


1222
0:42:45,3 --> 0:42:48,17
If there's a menu item
that my customers love,


1223
0:42:48,17 --> 0:42:50,76
that I don't make
money on, I hide it,


1224
0:42:50,76 --> 0:42:53,207
so no new customer find it.


1225
0:42:53,207 --> 0:42:54,54
The old customers know I got it.


1226
0:42:54,54 --> 0:42:55,54
I'm not going to take
it away from you.


1227
0:42:55,54 --> 0:42:57,85
But I don't want anybody else
getting hooked with this thing.


1228
0:42:57,85 --> 0:42:59,58
I want them [CLICKING SOUND].


1229
0:42:59,58 --> 0:43:2,65
So I hide that in the menu, and
move my most profitable items.


1230
0:43:2,65 --> 0:43:4,66
It's incredibly manipulative.


1231
0:43:4,66 --> 0:43:8,471
And I had the confidence to do
this because of that database.


1232
0:43:8,471 --> 0:43:10,22
Or I probably wouldn't
have the confidence


1233
0:43:10,22 --> 0:43:12,41
to make the bold moves
that I do sometimes.


1234
0:43:12,41 --> 0:43:13,7
MALE SPEAKER: And what is the
name of that invention where


1235
0:43:13,7 --> 0:43:16,36
you have the two rails
with just a limited space?


1236
0:43:16,36 --> 0:43:17,642
JON TAFFER: Butt funnel.


1237
0:43:17,642 --> 0:43:20,34
Made a lot of money, a lot of
mileage, off the butt fun--


1238
0:43:20,34 --> 0:43:22,48
the concept of the
butt funnel, and it's


1239
0:43:22,48 --> 0:43:24,27
for a youthful, high
energy nightclub.


1240
0:43:24,27 --> 0:43:27,28
It's a narrow entryway
to a dance floor.


1241
0:43:27,28 --> 0:43:28,79
So stand up for a second.


1242
0:43:28,79 --> 0:43:30,623
So if we're going to
go in this dance floor,


1243
0:43:30,623 --> 0:43:32,71
we got to sort of go like this.


1244
0:43:32,71 --> 0:43:34,25
Now, with a guy and
a girl, it tends


1245
0:43:34,25 --> 0:43:36,2
to work better most
of the time, but--


1246
0:43:36,2 --> 0:43:36,625
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]


1247
0:43:36,625 --> 0:43:37,79
JON TAFFER: The
fact is I'm forcing


1248
0:43:37,79 --> 0:43:39,2
their faces to be together.


1249
0:43:39,2 --> 0:43:41,47
I'm forcing eye contact.


1250
0:43:41,47 --> 0:43:43,5
I'm forcing human interaction.


1251
0:43:43,5 --> 0:43:46,7
And butt funneling, I
invented about 25 years ago.


1252
0:43:46,7 --> 0:43:48,555
Got a lot of mileage
out of the butt funnel.


1253
0:43:48,555 --> 0:43:49,68
MALE SPEAKER: That's great.


1254
0:43:49,68 --> 0:43:51,646
All right, next question.


1255
0:43:51,646 --> 0:43:54,27
AUDIENCE: OK, well, first I have
to say, sorry, that I actually


1256
0:43:54,27 --> 0:43:56,84
never watch your show,
which I have to start.


1257
0:43:56,84 --> 0:43:59,16
But it sounds like,
from your story,


1258
0:43:59,16 --> 0:44:1,72
that the first thing that
the owner does is like, oh,


1259
0:44:1,72 --> 0:44:2,83
I don't want to change.


1260
0:44:2,83 --> 0:44:5,58
So I'm curious what your take
on this human psychology.


1261
0:44:5,58 --> 0:44:7,98
On the one hand, they
obviously apply for the show,


1262
0:44:7,98 --> 0:44:9,89
and they know they're going
to be asked for a change.


1263
0:44:9,89 --> 0:44:11,6
But then they don't
want to change.


1264
0:44:11,6 --> 0:44:11,92
JON TAFFER: You know,
it's interesting,


1265
0:44:11,92 --> 0:44:14,77
when I look at those five
minute little casting reels


1266
0:44:14,77 --> 0:44:18,64
that we do, they say stuff
like oh, when Taffer gets here,


1267
0:44:18,64 --> 0:44:20,14
he's going to love me.


1268
0:44:20,14 --> 0:44:23,11
I mean he's going to think that
I'm as good at this as he is.


1269
0:44:23,11 --> 0:44:25,3
Boy, do they get a
surprise when I show up.


1270
0:44:25,3 --> 0:44:27,56
Then the other guy says, oh,
boy, if he screams at me,


1271
0:44:27,56 --> 0:44:29,25
I'm going to go at him.


1272
0:44:29,25 --> 0:44:31,57
I just look at him loudly,
and he starts crying.


1273
0:44:31,57 --> 0:44:32,9
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]


1274
0:44:32,9 --> 0:44:35,15
JON TAFFER: So they
take this posture.


1275
0:44:35,15 --> 0:44:35,73
It's strange.


1276
0:44:35,73 --> 0:44:37,76
And after shooting
59 of them, you'd


1277
0:44:37,76 --> 0:44:39,1
think they know what's coming.


1278
0:44:39,1 --> 0:44:42,26
But the fact of the
matter is each one of them


1279
0:44:42,26 --> 0:44:45,649
thinks that they're going
to be the one that I'm not


1280
0:44:45,649 --> 0:44:46,44
going to scream at.


1281
0:44:46,44 --> 0:44:50,55
And if you saw Gypsy, the Las
Vegas gay bar that we did,


1282
0:44:50,55 --> 0:44:52,3
remember what he says?


1283
0:44:52,3 --> 0:44:52,98
Oh, I got to tell you.


1284
0:44:52,98 --> 0:44:53,94
Jon is going to be my buddy.


1285
0:44:53,94 --> 0:44:55,42
And then after this
is all done, he's


1286
0:44:55,42 --> 0:44:57,544
going to go out for a drink,
and he's going to say,


1287
0:44:57,544 --> 0:45:0,192
Paul, you were right,
and I was wrong.


1288
0:45:0,192 --> 0:45:2,62
Yeah, that didn't quite work
out for him as he thought.


1289
0:45:2,62 --> 0:45:6,52
But it's fascinating, that
human dynamic that you're


1290
0:45:6,52 --> 0:45:8,53
setting yourself up
to be embarrassed


1291
0:45:8,53 --> 0:45:10,84
on national television.


1292
0:45:10,84 --> 0:45:13,809
And here's the
unique part of it.


1293
0:45:13,809 --> 0:45:16,1
At the end of the show,
they're not really embarrassed,


1294
0:45:16,1 --> 0:45:17,51
are they?


1295
0:45:17,51 --> 0:45:20,92
Nine out of ten episodes,
they turn, don't they?


1296
0:45:20,92 --> 0:45:22,81
And nine out of ten
episodes, at the end


1297
0:45:22,81 --> 0:45:25,434
you like them, even if they were
a total jerk in the beginning.


1298
0:45:25,434 --> 0:45:28,52
Remember, Ami, the guy in Denver
that I got in a fight with?


1299
0:45:28,52 --> 0:45:31,8
He called Chef Duffy "fat boy"?


1300
0:45:31,8 --> 0:45:33,75
So I swung at that guy.


1301
0:45:33,75 --> 0:45:35,7
I mean, he infuriated me.


1302
0:45:35,7 --> 0:45:37,77
We fought for three days.


1303
0:45:37,77 --> 0:45:40,48
And he was an
Israeli military guy,


1304
0:45:40,48 --> 0:45:43,84
about four feet
four inches tall,


1305
0:45:43,84 --> 0:45:45,94
who thought he was
about nine foot tall.


1306
0:45:45,94 --> 0:45:48,33
And this guy was an ass.


1307
0:45:48,33 --> 0:45:50,12
And what you didn't
see on cameras


1308
0:45:50,12 --> 0:45:53,2
before he said fat
boy to Chef Duffy,


1309
0:45:53,2 --> 0:45:55,45
he called his
employees assholes.


1310
0:45:55,45 --> 0:45:59,86
So my employees are stupid
assholes and your fat boy chef.


1311
0:45:59,86 --> 0:46:2,56
I just won't accept robbing
people of their dignity.


1312
0:46:2,56 --> 0:46:3,94
I don't do that.


1313
0:46:3,94 --> 0:46:7,17
And I'll attack what
you do, but I rarely


1314
0:46:7,17 --> 0:46:10,44
attack people personally,
unless it's a unique situation.


1315
0:46:10,44 --> 0:46:16,5
Make a long story short,
at the end, he said,


1316
0:46:16,5 --> 0:46:17,55
I prayed to God for an angel.


1317
0:46:17,55 --> 0:46:19,81
And the angel sent
me Jon Taffer.


1318
0:46:19,81 --> 0:46:22,39
So at the end, he
redeemed himself.


1319
0:46:22,39 --> 0:46:24,34
And I think that's
why they do it,


1320
0:46:24,34 --> 0:46:25,84
is they know at
the end of the show


1321
0:46:25,84 --> 0:46:28,625
if they're reasonable at all--
they were jerks along the way,


1322
0:46:28,625 --> 0:46:30,0
but at the end,
there's something


1323
0:46:30,0 --> 0:46:31,51
endearing about each of them.


1324
0:46:31,51 --> 0:46:32,76
I think that's the motivation.


1325
0:46:32,76 --> 0:46:34,152
Also, when you're losing
a half a million dollars,


1326
0:46:34,152 --> 0:46:35,61
and you've got a
family to support,


1327
0:46:35,61 --> 0:46:37,43
that could be pretty
motivating too.


1328
0:46:37,43 --> 0:46:40,525
And we do change fortunes.


1329
0:46:40,525 --> 0:46:42,15
AUDIENCE: I have two
questions for you.


1330
0:46:42,15 --> 0:46:44,44
One is you're very animated.


1331
0:46:44,44 --> 0:46:46,8
Your body language is unique.


1332
0:46:46,8 --> 0:46:49,18
Have you've studied people
for your own body language?


1333
0:46:49,18 --> 0:46:50,91
Is that what you came up with?


1334
0:46:50,91 --> 0:46:54,17
Because even on the show, every
move you make seems calculated.


1335
0:46:54,17 --> 0:46:54,92
JON TAFFER: It is.


1336
0:46:54,92 --> 0:46:58,73
AUDIENCE: And it's very
empowering and brilliant.


1337
0:46:58,73 --> 0:46:59,98
JON TAFFER: Thank you.


1338
0:46:59,98 --> 0:47:4,13
AUDIENCE: I just recognize it,
and it's very empowering, just


1339
0:47:4,13 --> 0:47:6,754
absolutely shocking
how much you move.


1340
0:47:6,754 --> 0:47:7,67
JON TAFFER: Thank you.


1341
0:47:7,67 --> 0:47:8,78
And it is.


1342
0:47:8,78 --> 0:47:11,14
It is very contrived.


1343
0:47:11,14 --> 0:47:14,53
I have to have more energy
than anybody in the room.


1344
0:47:14,53 --> 0:47:16,74
I've got to drive the
energy of the TV show,


1345
0:47:16,74 --> 0:47:19,27
as well as the five days
for those employees.


1346
0:47:19,27 --> 0:47:22,64
So my energy is critical to
moving the process along.


1347
0:47:22,64 --> 0:47:25,19
So if I have a flu, if
I have a fever, nope.


1348
0:47:25,19 --> 0:47:26,6
I got to be on every day.


1349
0:47:26,6 --> 0:47:28,8
I got to lift that energy.


1350
0:47:28,8 --> 0:47:30,514
The other thing is
I've got to be loud.


1351
0:47:30,514 --> 0:47:32,18
And the fact of the
matter is the things


1352
0:47:32,18 --> 0:47:33,85
that you-- back
to your question--


1353
0:47:33,85 --> 0:47:35,57
the things that I
say to them have


1354
0:47:35,57 --> 0:47:37,89
been said to them
before in many cases.


1355
0:47:37,89 --> 0:47:41,47
But when I say it, they are
going to frickin' hear it.


1356
0:47:41,47 --> 0:47:43,97
And I'm not going to
allow them not to hear it.


1357
0:47:43,97 --> 0:47:46,99
And these animations,
I'm even doing it now,


1358
0:47:46,99 --> 0:47:51,37
are really critical
to positioning myself


1359
0:47:51,37 --> 0:47:53,52
above them in their perception.


1360
0:47:53,52 --> 0:47:55,29
And I don't mean above
as a human being.


1361
0:47:55,29 --> 0:47:58,35
They need to look up to me, or
they're not going to follow me.


1362
0:47:58,35 --> 0:48:0,99
And the animations, the
energy, the body language,


1363
0:48:0,99 --> 0:48:3,38
the communication, the
eye contact, all of this


1364
0:48:3,38 --> 0:48:7,7
matters to me getting them to
slip into that submissive role,


1365
0:48:7,7 --> 0:48:9,885
if you will, and follow my lead.


1366
0:48:9,885 --> 0:48:12,262
AUDIENCE: Your book on
tape should be a video.


1367
0:48:12,262 --> 0:48:13,72
JON TAFFER: I have
some videos out.


1368
0:48:13,72 --> 0:48:15,928
As a matter of fact, I'm
launching in February Taffer


1369
0:48:15,928 --> 0:48:18,2
TV, which we're
launching, I just


1370
0:48:18,2 --> 0:48:20,24
built a whole production
studio in Las Vegas


1371
0:48:20,24 --> 0:48:22,77
with a 30-foot bar in it.


1372
0:48:22,77 --> 0:48:24,57
So it's a whole
educational program


1373
0:48:24,57 --> 0:48:26,392
that we're creating to do that.


1374
0:48:26,392 --> 0:48:27,225
AUDIENCE: Thank you.


1375
0:48:27,225 --> 0:48:28,35
JON TAFFER: You're welcome.


1376
0:48:28,35 --> 0:48:31,51
AUDIENCE: The second question
was when you rescue a bar,


1377
0:48:31,51 --> 0:48:34,3
and these people already
in financial trouble,


1378
0:48:34,3 --> 0:48:35,81
does the show pick
up the renovation?


1379
0:48:35,81 --> 0:48:36,21
JON TAFFER: Yes.


1380
0:48:36,21 --> 0:48:37,68
AUDIENCE: Does the
show pick up your fees?


1381
0:48:37,68 --> 0:48:38,99
Is there ever a deal
that goes on between--


1382
0:48:38,99 --> 0:48:40,35
JON TAFFER: The show
pays for everything.


1383
0:48:40,35 --> 0:48:41,53
The owner pays for nothing.


1384
0:48:41,53 --> 0:48:43,72
AUDIENCE: And they're completely
separate once you leave?


1385
0:48:43,72 --> 0:48:44,81
JON TAFFER: Yes, I
have no involvement


1386
0:48:44,81 --> 0:48:46,18
in the business when I leave.


1387
0:48:46,18 --> 0:48:48,42
As a matter of fact,
probably 80% of them,


1388
0:48:48,42 --> 0:48:51,4
I've never spoken
with when I left.


1389
0:48:51,4 --> 0:48:53,19
I will share my email with them.


1390
0:48:53,19 --> 0:48:55,36
If they have questions,
they can shoot me an email.


1391
0:48:55,36 --> 0:48:56,47
I give them my books.


1392
0:48:56,47 --> 0:48:57,89
I give them lists of promotions.


1393
0:48:57,89 --> 0:48:59,82
They get a binder
about this thick.


1394
0:48:59,82 --> 0:49:1,33
And nine out of
ten of them never


1395
0:49:1,33 --> 0:49:3,14
communicate with me ever again.


1396
0:49:3,14 --> 0:49:5,3
And I don't look back,
to be honest with you.


1397
0:49:5,3 --> 0:49:6,965
I'm always looking
forward at the next one.


1398
0:49:6,965 --> 0:49:9,34
AUDIENCE: One of the best
things you ever did on the show


1399
0:49:9,34 --> 0:49:12,74
was when you brought a previous
"Bar Rescue" owner in to spy


1400
0:49:12,74 --> 0:49:13,936
for another one.


1401
0:49:13,936 --> 0:49:15,6
That made a big impression.


1402
0:49:15,6 --> 0:49:16,735
JON TAFFER: We're doing a
bunch of that this season.


1403
0:49:16,735 --> 0:49:17,29
AUDIENCE: I hope so.


1404
0:49:17,29 --> 0:49:19,17
JON TAFFER: It's fun
for me, because A, it


1405
0:49:19,17 --> 0:49:21,207
gives you an update
on that bar when


1406
0:49:21,207 --> 0:49:22,54
they tell you how they're doing.


1407
0:49:22,54 --> 0:49:24,72
It shows the relationship
I created with them


1408
0:49:24,72 --> 0:49:26,22
that it's real.


1409
0:49:26,22 --> 0:49:28,3
And they went through
the experience,


1410
0:49:28,3 --> 0:49:29,76
so they're great
candidates to do that.


1411
0:49:29,76 --> 0:49:31,1
You're going to see a
lot of that this season.


1412
0:49:31,1 --> 0:49:31,766
AUDIENCE: Great.


1413
0:49:31,766 --> 0:49:32,49
Thank you.


1414
0:49:32,49 --> 0:49:33,8
JON TAFFER: My pleasure.


1415
0:49:33,8 --> 0:49:33,47
MALE SPEAKER: Great.


1416
0:49:33,47 --> 0:49:35,636
So it's actually the last
question we have time for.


1417
0:49:35,636 --> 0:49:39,44
Jon, do you have any other
final words or final advice


1418
0:49:39,44 --> 0:49:40,4
for some of us?


1419
0:49:40,4 --> 0:49:41,96
JON TAFFER: The
only final advice


1420
0:49:41,96 --> 0:49:45,28
I would give you is I've lived
a very unconventional life.


1421
0:49:45,28 --> 0:49:49,13
And it's because I live
my dream every day.


1422
0:49:49,13 --> 0:49:51,17
Dreams are inspiring.


1423
0:49:51,17 --> 0:49:53,4
Work is not.


1424
0:49:53,4 --> 0:49:54,524
Find a dream.


1425
0:49:54,524 --> 0:49:55,94
Whether it's that
client you can't


1426
0:49:55,94 --> 0:49:59,46
get that you've been
fighting for six months.


1427
0:49:59,46 --> 0:50:1,33
You got to have dreams.


1428
0:50:1,33 --> 0:50:2,88
Dreams make this world go on.


1429
0:50:2,88 --> 0:50:4,59
It built our whole country.


1430
0:50:4,59 --> 0:50:8,7
And when we get in a
rut as human beings


1431
0:50:8,7 --> 0:50:11,18
is when we lose touch
with our dreams.


1432
0:50:11,18 --> 0:50:13,55
We lose the ability to
fight for those dreams.


1433
0:50:13,55 --> 0:50:15,42
So don't be an
employee of Google.


1434
0:50:15,42 --> 0:50:17,91
Live your dreams at Google.


1435
0:50:17,91 --> 0:50:22,83
Find a way to match your dreams
with the goals of your company


1436
0:50:22,83 --> 0:50:24,64
in your own work,
because there's


1437
0:50:24,64 --> 0:50:29,32
nothing worse than mechanical
employees that lost touch


1438
0:50:29,32 --> 0:50:30,95
with their dream.


1439
0:50:30,95 --> 0:50:34,525
The other thing I would
say is leadership.


1440
0:50:34,525 --> 0:50:36,15
I'm one of the few
people who say this.


1441
0:50:36,15 --> 0:50:38,0
Leadership is not created.


1442
0:50:38,0 --> 0:50:40,4
You can read every
leadership book in the world.


1443
0:50:40,4 --> 0:50:41,665
I can't make somebody
a leader, if they


1444
0:50:41,665 --> 0:50:43,47
weren't by 12 years old.


1445
0:50:43,47 --> 0:50:46,93
Leadership is a trait that we
have, that we're born with.


1446
0:50:46,93 --> 0:50:48,43
The Pied Piper,
no, you never read


1447
0:50:48,43 --> 0:50:50,69
what a good musician
he was, do you?


1448
0:50:50,69 --> 0:50:52,36
Couldn't play the flute at
all, but people followed him


1449
0:50:52,36 --> 0:50:53,693
off the cliff because of who is.


1450
0:50:53,693 --> 0:50:55,83
How many entrepreneurs
do people follow


1451
0:50:55,83 --> 0:50:58,85
to bankruptcy that don't
know what they're doing?


1452
0:50:58,85 --> 0:51:1,6
Leadership is a
trait that is born.


1453
0:51:1,6 --> 0:51:4,71
When you find a great leader,
attach yourself to him.


1454
0:51:4,71 --> 0:51:7,49
Ride it to the end,
because great leadership


1455
0:51:7,49 --> 0:51:11,19
and your dreams together will
take you to the Promised Land.


1456
0:51:11,19 --> 0:51:13,41
And the worst thing
in the world is


1457
0:51:13,41 --> 0:51:17,45
when you see somebody who
lost touch with their dreams.


1458
0:51:17,45 --> 0:51:18,17
MALE SPEAKER: That's great.


1459
0:51:18,17 --> 0:51:20,12
All right, a round of
applause for Jon Taffer.


1460
0:51:20,12 --> 0:51:21,2
Thank you very much.


1461
0:51:21,2 --> 0:53:21,2
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]
