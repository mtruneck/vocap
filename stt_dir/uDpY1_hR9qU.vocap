###0 OMAR ERLINGSSON: My name's Omar Erlingsson.
###2 I'm in infrastructure security.
###5 I'm here to present the speaker for today's special talk
###10 with the Authors at Google series.
###12 So our speaker is Gudrun Johnsen,
###15 who is a statistician and economist from University
###19 of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and she has worked for the Icelandic
###24 Parliamentary Special Investigation Commission
###27 on investigating the causes of the economic collapse that
###31 happened in Iceland in 2008.
###33 So for me, it's quite a personal subject.
###37 I'm originally from Iceland.
###39 My family and I moved there in 2007 from here
###42 in Silicon Valley, where I've been working until then.
###45 And on a trip back, one of my colleagues
###49 asked me about what were the underpinnings
###52 of the Icelandic economy, and I knew
###56 that there was a lot of fish.
###57 That's what had been there when I was growing up,
###60 and I knew that there was a lot of banking,
###61 and I didn't exactly know what.
###64 There was some financing, banking, stocks,
###67 and so on, and very soon after that,
###72 it all came down with a bang.
###76 95% of the market value of the stock market
###79 vanished overnight.
###81 Three of the six-largest bankruptcies in world history
###86 are Icelandic banks, so quite a large turn of events.
###93 As it turned out, what really happened
###95 behind all of this, and this great, rapid rise in the banks,
###101 seems to be all kinds of different shenanigans.
###104 And so Gudrun is here to tell us about those shenanigans, which,
###108 because Iceland is relatively small,
###110 and because of this completely unprecedented
###112 special commission set up by the Parliament, which had basically
###116 total powers of investigative authority,
###119 able to see all data everywhere, with no exceptions,
###122 we actually know what happened there.
###125 But I think in a greater context, most of us
###130 had just moved to Iceland, and there's
###132 a lot of stuff that's going on in world finance
###136 and so on that is quite reminiscent of the shenanigans
###138 that were happening there a few years ago, and I don't think,
###141 fundamentally, very much has changed.
###143 So anyway, with those words, I will give the word over
###146 to Gudrun.
###147 GUDRUN JOHNSEN: Thank you, Omar.
###148 [APPLAUSE]
###150 GUDRUN JOHNSEN: Thank you so much, and a special thanks
###153 to Omar for inviting me here and organizing this event.
###157 It's a great opportunity for me to be here with you.
###161 I have been giving this talk mostly at financial
###165 institutions and government agencies,
###167 but I wrote this book, "Bringing Down the Banking System,"
###170 as a wrapping up this 2,400-page report that we issued that
###175 nobody read into manageable size of 200 pages,
###181 but I wrote it for non-financiers, let's say,
###186 if there's such a word.
###188 So it's great to finally be in front of my targeted audience.
###194 Now, as Omar mentioned briefly, 97% of the Icelandic banking
###201 sector collapsed in October 2008,
###206 and before we entered into the investigation
###210 of the Special Investigation Commission,
###213 where I was actually the first employee
###215 to be hired by the Commission-- so I was there from day one
###219 until the minute it was published in 2012--
###224 we sort of had an idea why this happened.
###228 But obviously, that wasn't enough for the Icelandic public
###232 to be told that that was a result of a rapid growth
###236 of credit, and size of the banking balance sheets to GDP,
###241 and inadequate financial supervision.
###243 I mean, that's the short, elevator story,
###246 but we needed to tell them how exactly this is possible,
###250 and how do you do this-- expanding your banking
###254 sector from being about 1 times GDP to 10 times
###258 GDP at the peak?
###262 We also needed to tell them why would you ever want to do this,
###267 given that this is a really risky strategy, so why would
###274 you ever want to do this?
###276 The third question we had to answer was why on earth
###281 didn't anybody stop this development?
###284 And finally, in my book, I try to bring forward
###289 to the rest of the financial world
###291 what we can learn from this calamity.
###295 Now, I will ask you to jot down your questions.
###299 We're going to save the best for last-- your questions.
###302 It's quite a lot of material.
###304 It demands quite a bit from the audience,
###308 so I'll ask you to wait with your questions
###311 until at the very end, unless something
###314 is horribly vague or confusing.
###319 Now, very briefly, on the SIC, it was installed by Parliament,
###324 and there were three people appointed by the Parliament
###327 to sit on the Commission.
###328 There was a Supreme Court justice, Pall Hreinsson,
###331 Sigridur Benediktsdottir, who was a lecturer at the Economics
###334 Department at Yale University at the time,
###336 and another lawyer, Tryggvi Gunnarsson,
###340 who's Althingi's Ombudsman.
###343 Althingi is the Icelandic parliament.
###347 Now, the mandate was not of any insignificance.
###353 It was to seek the truth, no less, behind the events leading
###357 up to the fall of the Icelandic banks,
###360 and what was also quite challenging
###363 in a small society-- and bear this in mind
###365 throughout the lecture.
###367 Iceland is a large country, relatively large,
###371 but we are only 330,000, roughly, who live there.
###376 So somebody told me half of Frankfurt.
###380 Half of Frankfurt-- that struck me as a quite a good benchmark.
###386 Now, the challenging part was to basically find out
###393 whether mistakes or negligence had occurred
###396 in the course of the implementation of the laws
###401 and other rules regulating, or providing control for,
###404 the financial market.
###406 And in addition, what persons may be responsible?
###410 Now, the degrees of separation in Iceland
###415 is obviously one or two, so this is a delicate matter.
###419 This was a privilege to actually be involved with this effort,
###425 simply because the Icelandic parliament thought
###428 that it would be impossible to deliver a proper investigation
###435 without full access to all data that the Commission deemed
###442 necessary to deliver on their mission.
###447 Now, we basically had powers to search all premises,
###453 seize evidence considered necessary
###454 for the purpose of its investigation,
###456 subpoena witnesses.
###458 And in return, we were to report any suspicious contact
###463 to the special prosecutor, who was still working on cases
###469 brought about as a result of this investigation and other.
###474 The final product was a 2,400-page report,
###479 published 12th of April 2010, and the task was quite big.
###486 We did not like the Lehman examiner's report.
###489 It's also 2,400 pages.
###491 We'll go over that soon, but just to tell you,
###496 the scope of the research was the third-largest bankruptcy
###501 in history.
###503 And we had to go into three banks--
###508 not only one-- and all surveillance authorities
###511 involved with oversight of the financial sector.
###518 In addition, a special request from Parliament
###520 was to investigate the cross-ownership
###523 of Icelandic firms, and I think there,
###527 the biggest contribution to the rest of the world of finance
###530 lies.
###531 This analysis into the cross-ownership
###535 of Icelandic firms.
###538 Now, we were 48 people.
###540 We're, again, 330,000 people living in Iceland,
###545 and it was quite remarkable that we
###548 were able to find people who were not conflicted in any way.
###554 Many of them had been living here in the States.
###558 Most of them had done research, were PhDs from here
###564 in the States-- Yale, Stanford, and elsewhere.
###568 So basically, with all this data,
###573 we collected data from the entire financial market,
###581 funding of the banks, all loan portfolios of the banks,
###584 so every single loan, including Visa statements,
###590 the salary data, and also, what I'm particularly proud of-- we
###597 gathered data from the stock market,
###600 and down to basically individual investors
###604 on both sides of the trade-- so this
###609 is a high-frequency dataset.
###612 In addition to the data I mentioned before, we also
###616 received the entire registry of enterprises in Iceland,
###620 and that was essential to be able to drill down
###625 the cross-ownership of firms.
###628 Now, just for the sake of comparison,
###634 the cost of the investigation-- you
###637 can find the whole report on this.
###639 There are selected chapters translated in English.
###643 2,400 pages, 800 pages supplement
###647 online-- it took us 15 months, and the cost
###651 was $2.5 million US.
###654 Now, the examiner report on the fall of Lehman Brothers
###659 is also available online.
###661 It is 2,200 pages.
###663 It took them 15 months to get it done.
###668 The cost was $38 million-plus US.
###671 So you can see that you can get experts
###674 from Iceland on the cheap.
###675 [LAUGHTER]
###678 Now, to start answering the questions I proposed
###681 in the beginning-- how did this happen?
###687 At the early start, funding was easy,
###690 and basically the bankers went into the European medium-term
###693 note market, and received about 35 billion euros'
###700 worth of bond issues.
###702 AUDIENCE: Sorry, the European what market?
###704 GUDRUN JOHNSEN: The European medium-term note market.
###708 That is a standardized, bond-issuance program.
###713 So you see here that the columns here
###720 show that the European market had
###724 a big appetite for the Icelandic bonds in 2005.
###728 It dropped somewhat in 2006, and you
###730 see what opened up-- that was the US medium-term note market.
###734 It opened up for the Icelandic banks,
###737 simply because of this very nice feature.
###741 They had a stellar credit rating that was largely
###744 inherited by the Icelandic state, which was virtually
###748 debt-free at the time, but they were also
###750 willing to pay high interest rates
###753 at the level of other emerging-market institutions
###756 a with lower credit rating.
###759 Now, it was as if they didn't really think this through.
###764 The appetite for issuing bonds was enormous,
###767 but they were bond issues for three- to five-year maturity,
###772 and in fact, the first big payment
###780 was too big for them to deliver on.
###784 So in October 2008, Glitnir bank went
###788 to the Central Bank of Iceland, and basically said
###791 that they wouldn't be able to meet this payment,
###793 and asked for of a loan of last resort, and from then on,
###798 things started to unravel quickly.
###801 Now, the terms were good in the beginning,
###806 as credit rating went through the roof.
###809 In 2007, they received the highest grade,
###812 top of the class, triple-A rating from Moody's, which
###818 Moody's corrected in a couple of months.
###821 Moody's thought that these banks were simply too big to fail,
###827 and would be bailed out in whichever circumstances,
###835 but failed to recognize that the banks had already
###839 exceeded the GDP, where everything we produce
###842 in Iceland 10 times, so we would never
###846 be able to bail out those banks.
###848 Now, as you see here, it's a nice-- here at Google,
###852 the first thing you do is to plot your data--
###855 and here you see Kaupthing five-year bond issues.
###860 At the beginning, they are issuing 1 billion euros.
###863 At the time, at a rate around 20, 20 to 30, and it rapidly
###869 grows.
###870 Here are some peculiar outliers.
###872 Somebody is accepting much lower rate than the market is.
###878 Now, we did receive our warning.
###884 In 2006, a market analyst started
###888 to point out that this rapid growth of the balance
###892 sheets of the banks was unsustainable,
###895 and, well, primarily, Danske Bank
###898 came up with this very nice term for it-- the geysir crisis.
###903 And it fitted this episode very well,
###906 because the CDS spreads-- the Credit Default
###909 Spreads-- they kind of blew up, but settled down quickly
###914 again at a lower level.
###917 But that did not measure up to what was to happen later on,
###923 when the big, blue mountain blew up,
###926 and we had CDS spreads going through the 1,000 mark.
###932 Both Icelandic bankers and officials alike
###937 dismissed this market signal completely,
###939 and they claimed that the CDS market
###943 was marked by collusion, ignorance--
###947 it was a thin market, and so on, and so forth.
###951 And it is just as if they didn't really
###954 know what they were talking about,
###955 or they didn't really look, because when the banks failed,
###961 there were $70 billion US outstanding CDS
###966 contracts on those three banks.
###968 And again, comparing to Lehman, outstanding CDS contracts
###972 on Lehman were $72 billion, so it
###975 was, by no means, a liquid market, in that sense.
###981 Of course, it's a market with insurance,
###983 so it's not going to behave like stock markets, right?
###987 Now, being faced with such a high cost of funding,
###995 the banks simply had to turn elsewhere to refund the banks,
###1001 and where did they go?
###1003 They went into two directions.
###1006 One was to go to the supremely informed central banks,
###1010 and they managed to borrow the equivalent of 9 billion euros
###1016 at the very height.
###1018 Again, comparing to the financial rescue package
###1022 that Iceland received from the IMF and the rest of Scandinavia
###1026 was about 3.5 billion euros, so a significant amount of money
###1033 they borrowed from the central banks.
###1035 And how did they manage to do that?
###1039 Well, they backed it with bank bonds, to large degree.
###1045 Here you can see the collateralized lending
###1048 from the Central Bank of Iceland.
###1049 This is denominated in ISK, so you can see basically
###1053 how dependent they are of this short-term, fine-tuning funding
###1059 facility from the central bank, so for three years, they're
###1062 completely dependent here on the $100 billion-- at the time,
###1066 was roughly half of the budget of the Icelandic state.
###1069 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?
###1071 GUDRUN JOHNSEN: Say again?
###1072 AUDIENCE: What's the conversion [INAUDIBLE]?
###1074 GUDRUN JOHNSEN: Roughly 100.
###1077 Now, they backed it with government-secured bonds,
###1084 but also with fellow bank bonds, and that they did
###1089 at an increasing rate.
###1093 The central bank acknowledged that
###1097 this collateralized lending was getting excessive,
###1101 so they tried to stem the funding to three banks,
###1105 but the bankers really didn't stop at that,
###1108 so they asked a rival, small, cooperative bank
###1111 to aid them in the process of virtually printing money out
###1115 of the Icelandic Central Bank.
###1117 So what they did was they issued new bonds, fresh bonds.
###1121 That's a certain interest term, and then they
###1126 turned to the rival bank, which received the bank bonds, which
###1130 then, again, turned to the Central Bank of Iceland
###1133 to get liquidity out the Central Bank of Iceland.
###1139 And the bankers reported it to the Special Investigation
###1142 Commission that this was a stunt that they played, and had
###1146 learned about from other European bankers, which
###1151 is a little bit worrying, obviously.
###1154 Now, they did try to play the same trick on the European
###1160 Central Bank.
###1163 They placed bonds as collateral against the loans
###1170 from the European Central Bank, but you
###1173 see how they pick up on it in May,
###1176 and the story goes that the ECB basically
###1182 directed their demands towards the governors of the Central
###1186 Bank of Iceland to have the bankers take this out,
###1190 realizing that they were swapping bonds.
###1192 There was no original investor backing them at the outset,
###1197 and after awhile, they basically disappeared from the books
###1202 as collaterals of the ECB.
###1205 Now, what they did, though, and the amounts
###1211 were quite steep-- 4.5 billion euros they received
###1217 at the very top from the European Central Bank--
###1220 so after having been asked to take out the Icelandic bank
###1225 bonds, well, they replaced them with CLOs and CDOs
###1229 that had ISK assets among them.
###1233 So collateral in ISK, in Icelandic krona,
###1237 against the loan in euros is not a good collateral at all,
###1242 so there's a whole story about that.
###1244 And the Icelandic Central Bank, in fact,
###1248 bought these CLOs from the European Central Bank
###1252 in the year 2010, and the European Central Bank
###1260 reported that it did not lose anything
###1264 on the deals with the Icelandic banks.
###1269 That was not the same story with the Icelandic central bank,
###1272 which virtually became bankrupt, as a result of receiving
###1277 collaterals that they couldn't collect
###1279 after the banks had gone over.
###1283 Back to the growth, and I know I'm cheating here a little bit.
###1287 I am showing you here nominal growth,
###1291 but it was reported-- nominal growth, 20-fold in seven years.
###1297 So prior to getting involved with the Special Investigation
###1302 Commission, I was working for the IMF, where we were studying
###1306 rapid credit growth, and I can tell you
###1308 that it's impossible to find data
###1313 that would show you larger growth of any banking sector.
###1321 Now, obviously, when you see banks grow this fast,
###1327 some people get worried.
###1329 They know that institutional structure,
###1334 or an institutional capacity, does not really
###1337 support this growth.
###1338 People cannot extend credit at this fast a pace,
###1344 and ensuring that all relevant documents have been collected,
###1349 and the credit scoring has been proper.
###1353 
###1357 So the bankers basically pointed out,
###1360 after receiving this criticism, that they
###1362 were growing too fast.
###1363 Well, we are diversifying.
###1366 We are getting outside of Iceland,
###1368 acquiring new institutions, new banks, new endeavors.
###1375 But when we looked at this, and tried to verify this statement,
###1379 we saw that not only was the acquisition growth large,
###1385 but the organic growth was also quite large-- another world
###1390 record, basically.
###1391 We saw the banks grow 50%, 60%, 35%.
###1396 This is phenomenal.
###1397 
###1400 So it surely was a strain on the institutional infrastructure.
###1407 Now, then you could ask yourself, again
###1409 with the 330,000 people, all of this money coming in,
###1413 what did they do with the money?
###1415 
###1422 The Commission basically was able to,
###1424 although the data that was a little bit difficult there--
###1430 background variables weren't properly collected--
###1433 but there are features in the identification number,
###1436 or social security number in Iceland,
###1438 that aided us in categorizing the loans that
###1441 had been extended.
###1443 And we found out that about 60% of the loan books
###1447 were to foreign entities-- so implying diversification--
###1452 and to holding companies in 2007.
###1459 But after good cooperation with Luxembourgian authorities,
###1464 because we didn't, obviously, have the same data privileges
###1469 in the UK or Luxembourg or elsewhere,
###1473 where the Icelandic banks had operations.
###1475 We did not have any access to data from the subsidiaries.
###1483 The Luxembourgian authorities supplied us
###1486 with two data points, where we could
###1489 see that the maturity of the loan books of the subsidiaries
###1493 were also somehow connected to ISK risk,
###1499 so dismissing this statement that the growth was primarily
###1505 outside of the country, and at the hands of diversification.
###1510 Now, back to that small population,
###1515 you've got to wonder how is it possible to extend
###1519 such an amount of credit, given the legal constraint that one
###1524 banking institution can only extend about 25%
###1528 of its equity base towards a group of related parties?
###1535 Now, we think we know how you do that,
###1541 and this is basically how you do that.
###1545 This is the cross-ownership of firms in Iceland.
###1549 The red dots represent each firm,
###1552 and there are some ownership connections to the next dot,
###1556 but these are only large firms in Iceland, so let's say,
###1563 500 million ISK is $5 million US, roughly,
###1568 is the balance sheet of each and every firm here.
###1572 You see where the nodes lead?
###1575 These nodes are the banks themselves,
###1579 so this is the interconnectedness
###1581 of the Icelandic economy before the collapse.
###1585 Then our task was to assess who are the related parties,
###1594 according to the definition of the law?
###1597 And using an algorithm and this network analysis,
###1600 we were able to assess, or rather come up
###1604 with an unbiased methodology, to actually find out
###1609 who were connected, and here you see just two random examples.
###1612 And what was also a little bit scary to see
###1618 is the circular events that you see.
###1622 Here is a firm A that owns firm B that owns firm
###1624 C that owns firm A. So under these circumstances,
###1629 virtually no equity, no skin, is put in the game.
###1634 So one of the lessons is that if we don't properly
###1642 analyze ownership or ownership ties
###1646 or interconnectedness in our system,
###1649 we know that agents that play this game simply have-- the sky
###1656 is the limit, so there's really no limit to how much risk
###1660 they're willing to take, because they are not
###1662 risking their own money at all.
###1666 Now, after we had identified the related parties,
###1672 we then merged them to the portfolios
###1674 of the banks-- the loan portfolios-- and lo and behold,
###1678 we found out that the borrowers were, to a large extent,
###1682 the owners of the banks.
###1685 It varied a little bit in levels how much access
###1689 they had to their bank, but here, this particular group,
###1693 Baugur Group, received the equivalent of about 80%
###1699 of the equity base of Glitnir, where
###1706 they were controlling shareholders.
###1709 So here you see the legal limit is 25.
###1710 They exceeded it throughout the time.
###1714 Now, here's their business partner,
###1717 who also gained a controlling stake at the bank
###1720 at some point.
###1721 Somebody wants to venture a guess when that happened?
###1724 AUDIENCE: 2007.
###1724 GUDRUN JOHNSEN: So yeah, it's right here, in June 2007.
###1731 So as I say, it was the same pattern in all three banks.
###1736 Here Bjorgolfur Thor Bjorgolfsson,
###1741 one of the controlling stakeholders,
###1743 exceeded the 25% threshold throughout the four-year period
###1748 we had data for.
###1752 And the same goes for Exista, controlling stakeholder
###1756 in Kaupthing bank, again, dancing along the line
###1759 throughout the period.
###1762 Now, obviously the loan portfolios
###1765 were marked by excessive risk, and the next task
###1770 was to see the payment structure of these loans,
###1773 and that was also quite shocking to discover
###1777 that not only had they been extended
###1779 to holding companies that were tied to the owners
###1783 to a large degree, but also they were not
###1785 paying anything off the loans.
###1787 They were not paying interest rates,
###1790 and they were not paying off any of the loan
###1792 during the lifetime of the loan, so bullet loans
###1795 became the largest share of the portfolios.
###1799 Then you wonder, what type of collateral
###1802 are these borrowers putting forward?
###1807 And that really matters.
###1808 
###1815 Because we had this beautiful data privilege and this dataset
###1819 from the stock market, and we had also access to the bank,
###1823 so we could see what was inside of the custodian
###1827 accounts of the banks, because that's an old trick in the book
###1830 to have your bank hold the stocks that you are pledged,
###1833 so your ownership is not disclosed at all.
###1837 
###1840 So what did they pledge?
###1842 Basically, to a large degree, the banks
###1845 had received a collateral in the form
###1848 of listed stocks in Iceland.
###1851 
###1854 There is a caveat here, because the data quality on collateral
###1859 was incredibly poor, so this was really
###1863 the only comprehensive data that we could receive,
###1869 in terms of collateral.
###1871 So this is a little bit misrepresentative here,
###1873 but still we saw that, for example,
###1878 FL Group was an investment boutique, or investment
###1881 closed-end fund, in fact, and about 70%
###1885 of all outstanding shares in this firm
###1888 were pledged into the banking sector.
###1892 To our horror, though, we saw that about 40% of Kaupthing
###1905 was pledged into Kaupthing as collateral, or as treasury
###1909 stocks.
###1910 Now, that is illegal.
###1912 You are only allowed, according to Icelandic law,
###1915 to hold 10% of treasury stocks.
###1918 This is illegal in the States.
###1922 At least if you do have treasury stocks,
###1925 you need to deduct them from your equity base.
###1928 It's money that hasn't been paid into the firm,
###1933 or equity that hasn't been paid into the firm.
###1937 The following question, after having discovered this,
###1940 we had to ask ourselves, how did they behave in the stock
###1943 market, then, I mean, now that they were
###1945 dependent on collaterals from the stock market?
###1949 And lo and behold, we saw a certain pattern there as well.
###1955 Here you see Kaupthing trading in own shares,
###1961 and Kaupthing is buying above 0, and they are selling below 0,
###1967 and the blue line here represents
###1969 the price of the share price of the Kaupthing stocks.
###1976 And you immediately-- it jumps out of the picture
###1979 that this is not symmetric, so they
###1982 are buying close to 60% of the volume.
###1986 Of all trades in Kaupthing, they are
###1989 on the buying side at the very end,
###1991 but what are they doing in terms of selling?
###1993 They're not selling anything.
###1995 So what were they then doing?
###1999 What type of business was this?
###2002 What we figured out was that they were primarily--
###2005 you see the blue columns here-- they are above 0,
###2008 so they are being bought on the stock exchange,
###2012 but Kaupthing is selling over the counter.
###2016 Now, one of my favorite pictures in the whole 2,400 pages
###2022 is right here.
###2024 It represents the level of leverage in the Icelandic stock
###2028 exchange.
###2031 It's a delta, so how much are we increasing,
###2033 in terms of taking collateral in the form of listed shares?
###2039 And as long as you are receiving more and more collateral,
###2042 or you're accepting more and more collateral
###2045 in the form of stocks they are buying on the margin
###2049 more and more, you see that the price is rising.
###2051 
###2054 The red line there leveling out--
###2056 as soon as you stop accepting listed shares as collateral,
###2061 the price drops like a stone.
###2063 So this is virtually a picture of an asset price bubble.
###2068 
###2072 AUDIENCE: Why were they buying [INAUDIBLE]?
###2074 
###2084 GUDRUN JOHNSEN: Why were they buying
###2085 all these shares in themselves?
###2087 Basically they had become quite dependent on the share price,
###2093 and we will see it on the next slide, which
###2096 added to their demise, is that the largest
###2099 controlling stakeholders had also
###2100 borrowed money from the big investment houses in the US--
###2104 so Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, and those--
###2106 and they had pledged the Icelandic stocks
###2108 in the Icelandic banks as collateral
###2111 against these international loans.
###2114 Now, after the stock market had started to decline,
###2120 the Americans basically called on the margin,
###2123 and what the bankers in Iceland decided then-- well,
###2126 we can't allow this to happen, because they
###2128 will go into the market, and sell those shares,
###2130 and what will happen with our pool of collaterals?
###2133 It will decline.
###2134 So they decide to chip in, and pay the margin calls,
###2138 and refund those shares that were in themselves, accepting
###2142 their own shares as collateral.
###2144 So basically, a year before the banks
###2148 finally collapsed, they had become
###2150 so dependent on their own stock prices
###2153 that they decide to bat for life,
###2156 and take over this collateral that is no collateral,
###2163 if they themselves go under.
###2165 
###2167 Which then, again, this would have been fine
###2171 if they had deducted the shares that they took
###2175 as collaterals from the equity base,
###2178 but they forgot about that.
###2181 So if we take that into account--
###2185 and here you see we only take that into account--
###2188 the capital adequacy ratio that they reported
###2191 was misreported basically, and here you see Glitnir.
###2195 It's, in fact, close to the legal limit, which
###2199 is 8%, a year before the bank collapsed.
###2205 For Landsbanki, it had already gone below the 8% limit,
###2210 so there the Financial Supervisory Authority
###2213 should have tapped in and taken over the operations.
###2219 And if you count cross-financing--
###2224 financing of the rivals-- in fact,
###2226 22% of the equity is basically funded this way, and 36%, 33%,
###2232 2008, so one third of the equity was basically not there,
###2238 and in my mind, that is falsification of equity,
###2241 but the report goes the route that claiming that this is weak
###2244 equity that cannot be drawn on in the case of bankruptcy.
###2250 Now, you've got to start wondering why people do this,
###2258 and the short answer is, they became rich.
###2263 Here you see the incentive schemes
###2265 pushed for excessive risk taking,
###2269 and just as a very small evidence
###2273 of that is that here you see the total share of base salary,
###2279 of total pay, in 2004 in Landsbanki.
###2284 Here's the 99th percentile, so the CEO is placed here,
###2288 and the key personnel-- they received about 40%
###2292 in base salary in 2004.
###2295 In 2007, it's below 10%, so economists--
###2302 we have sympathy towards the decision-making process that
###2306 happens there.
###2307 One, if you're not going to meet your bonus target, you going
###2312 to reduce your consumption by 90%?
###2315 No, there's is a very strong incentive
###2318 to start manipulating a little bit,
###2322 or extending the evergreening loans,
###2324 and so on, and so forth-- rolling over loans,
###2327 so that the picture looks a bit more rosy to meet the targets,
###2331 and that is exactly what happened.
###2332 
###2335 There's enough material for a separate talk on the incentive
###2339 schemes themselves, but in short, whether intentional
###2345 or not, the management of the banks
###2349 used staff as vehicles to falsify equity.
###2353 In Landsbanki, for example, stock options
###2356 were issued one day, not as a bargaining tool in salary
###2363 negotiations, but one day, we have
###2366 a record within Landsbanki, where staffers were called up,
###2371 and said, hey, you've got an option grant now.
###2374 Please come up and sign.
###2376 And the management decided to hatch those options,
###2387 so basically in the beginning, they lent money into SPVs
###2393 in Cayman Islands and offshore, lent money
###2397 to have the SPV go into the market to buy the stocks,
###2402 and hold them until the options were vested
###2406 or they were exercised.
###2408 Now, this is a rather unusual and unnecessary hatch.
###2414 As I say, we can go into depth here,
###2417 but in short, obviously the management
###2422 decides on the timing on when to go into the market
###2424 and buy those shares, and what happens when you inject
###2427 into the market billions of ISK buying stocks in Landsbanki?
###2432 Well, the price will go up, of course,
###2435 and the options will be in the money immediately.
###2438 Kaupthing started out with this, but they faded out their option
###2442 program, and instead they had their staff borrow money
###2447 from the bank to go themselves into the stock market,
###2449 and buy the shares.
###2452 The shares were a collateral in that loan deal,
###2459 and therefore should have been deducted from the equity base.
###2464 Now, back to the funding side.
###2469 
###2471 The banks were experiencing incredibly high prices
###2475 on funding, or terms, in the bond markets,
###2478 so apart from going to central banks,
###2482 they went into the streets of London and Amsterdam
###2485 to get money through deposit collection,
###2491 and here you can see the total debt of Landsbanki.
###2493 It changes rapidly.
###2494 The loans and deposits become the largest share
###2499 of the funding structure.
###2502 Now, as it is very risky to extend credit out rapidly,
###2507 it is also very risky to collect deposits very rapidly,
###2512 and they tend to be not so loyal.
###2515 And how were they ever able to attract all these 300,000
###2520 depositors in the UK in less than six months?
###2524 They basically offered the highest rate.
###2527 And you're not supposed to scrutinize this regression
###2534 analysis.
###2535 This is very crude, and you see that there is not very much
###2538 variation here, but basically we saw
###2543 that if Landsbanki reached the first place, as highest deposit
###2548 rates-- they attracted about 18 million, on average, a week
###2554 into the accounts, but if it dropped down to fifth place,
###2560 they lost 16 million, so these were not very sticky.
###2566 It's very volatile funding, and here
###2569 is a picture of basically outrun on the bank that happened here
###2572 in the early of 2008.
###2575 There's a whole story behind that,
###2577 but I will leave my book to tell you.
###2580 AUDIENCE: Are they able to pay those high rates
###2582 by attracting future customers?
###2584 GUDRUN JOHNSEN: So the question is, are they
###2586 able to pay those high rates?
###2587 Well, at the end of the day, no, of course not.
###2591 They were run upon.
###2593 Well, as they collecting, they paid the interest rates, yes,
###2599 but it was not sustainable model, as it turned out.
###2602 AUDIENCE: So is it sort of like a pyramid-scheme thing, where
###2605 by offering higher rates, we'll get
###2605 a lot of [INAUDIBLE] customers, and we
###2607 can use [INAUDIBLE] deposits, and pay the high rate?
###2610 [INAUDIBLE]
###2611 GUDRUN JOHNSEN: So is it like a Ponzi scheme, where
###2613 you are giving up high rates as you have the program open,
###2620 and then you just disappear?
###2621 Yeah, well, it was not intended like that,
###2625 but that is the effect of it.
###2627 Now, as you can see here, here's a random Icesave in April 2008,
###2638 and at the time, the management of Landsbanki
###2642 reported it to the Central Bank of Iceland
###2644 that with this outflow, they would
###2647 survive for six more days.
###2650 The Icelandic governors of the Central Bank of Iceland
###2655 then reported that to the government,
###2657 to the prime minister and the foreign minister,
###2666 and there was really no reaction to this news.
###2672 Icesave has been the largest foreign dispute
###2675 Iceland has had since the Cod Wars,
###2678 and this is an ongoing saga, and hasn't been fully resolved,
###2685 although the EFTA Court ruled on whether the Icelandic state was
###2692 liable for the deposits, or should pay out the deposit
###2697 insurance amount to the foreign depositors.
###2700 
###2703 The Court ruled in favor of Iceland
###2708 basically, so we have figured out where the liability lies
###2713 with a state or with an insurance fund that
###2717 has been set up, and, in fact, in this case,
###2719 the insurance fund is liable.
###2723 Now, as Lehman Brothers failed, obviously that
###2733 proved to be an accelerator, in terms
###2735 of deciding the fates of the Icelandic banks.
###2739 After the collapse of Lehman, the collaterals
###2742 that had been pledged against loans from the ECB
###2748 fell sharply, so the ECB started to call on the margin.
###2753 Also, the depositors in the UK and the Netherlands
###2761 became uneasy, so they started to withdraw their funds
###2764 from the accounts, and essentially, Landsbanki
###2769 was run upon, and since they had collected the Icesave deposits
###2781 into a branch, which was under the supervision
###2785 of the Icelandic Financial Supervisory Authority,
###2788 the Brits had very little means to step in.
###2793 They knew that Landsbanki was not meeting its liquidity
###2797 requirements, because the money was just rolling out,
###2801 so they they found no other option
###2805 except for intervening through a legal act that
###2811 has become very controversial in Iceland--
###2814 the so-called Terrorist Act, whose name is,
###2817 in fact, Anti-Terrorism, Crime, and Security Act of 2001.
###2822 So the deposits of Landsbanki were moved out of Landsbanki,
###2828 and basically the fate of the bank was therefore decided,
###2834 or they had met their fate, let's say.
###2838 But we know now that the banks had little chance,
###2846 both because they were so interconnected,
###2849 and they had not enough equity as a buffer
###2855 to see any of their assets go down in value.
###2861 Now, basically Kaupthing met the same fate a day later.
###2869 The story is a little bit different there,
###2871 because Kaupthing adds, where they were collecting deposits
###2875 from the UK residents and elsewhere, was
###2878 done through a subsidiary.
###2880 And this is one of the lessons of the Icelandic episode
###2885 is the difference between a subsidiary and branch,
###2891 and who is responsible for the financial oversight.
###2895 Now, the Brits were responsible for the oversight in this case,
###2900 and after Northern Rock had failed-- first bank
###2902 in 150 years or so to fail in the UK--
###2907 the supervisory authority became quite worried that there might
###2913 be other vulnerabilities in their system,
###2915 and what they spotted immediately
###2917 were the Icelandic banks.
###2919 And basically the Deposit Insurance Fund was underfunded,
###2927 so the British depositors acknowledged
###2930 that in case of failure, it would be difficult
###2934 for them to reclaim the money.
###2937 So in all of the circumstances-- and obviously,
###2940 bear in mind that Lehman had just
###2942 failed-- the British had seen some movement of funds out
###2947 of the UK over to the US just prior
###2953 to the collapse of Lehman, the British authorities basically
###2957 set up a very stringent liquidity rule
###2960 against Kaupthing saying, 95% of those deposits
###2964 that you are collecting through Kaupthing Edge--
###2967 we need you to put them into liquid funds,
###2969 into treasuries and papers that can be converted into cash very
###2976 quickly.
###2978 So with this rule, the Kaupthing management
###2984 should not have been able to use it for their own good,
###2987 but, in fact, they managed to trick
###2989 the financial supervisory authority in the UK
###2991 for awhile, because they engaged in a liquidity
###2995 swap between the parent company and the subsidiary.
###3000 So in essence, they counted the money two or three times,
###3004 so the first time around, it was counted as liquid money.
###3008 The second time around it was just
###3011 their funds, which they could do whatever with, and including
###3014 sending it up to Iceland for the parent company
###3017 to meet their margins, or pay off their bonds,
###3020 and so on, and so forth, and that is exactly what happened.
###3023 Now, on top of this, so there were 1.1 billion pounds
###3031 sterling engaged in this, so missing
###3034 from the liquidity pool of Kaupthing.
###3038 But on top of that, the collateral
###3041 that they had pledged to the subsidiary for lending
###3046 from the daughter company declined in value,
###3050 but the subsidiary was irrespectively
###3054 willing to extend the credit lines by 500 million pounds,
###3061 without taking any collateral, and this
###3063 the British interpreted as siphoning money up
###3068 through the chain of firms, and up to the parent company.
###3072 
###3075 And as a result, having waited for the management of Kaupthing
###3081 to react, the British authorities deemed
###3085 it necessary to take over the Kaupthing Edge deposits
###3089 and move them into ING, and withdraw the bank
###3093 license from the [INAUDIBLE] of KSF--
###3096 so a similar fate, slightly different story.
###3102 Back to Iceland, the debt-free state-- in early 2008,
###3109 suggestions were being made to the Icelandic authorities
###3112 that it should turn to the IMF for help.
###3117 That was after the Central Bank of Iceland
###3119 had tried to get credit or foreign-exchange
###3122 swaps with central banks in Europe,
###3126 and even here in America, without success.
###3128 And that is a signal that is fairly decisive--
###3132 a debt-free state unable to get any credit anywhere.
###3136 That should tell you something about the situation.
###3140 The only takers in the FX swap market
###3145 were the Scandinavian central banks,
###3147 who, in turn, put forward very strict conditions, in exchange
###3153 for the money swapped.
###3155 And the conditions were at the microeconomic management level,
###3163 such as, the centrally negotiated wages cannot
###3173 increase in real terms.
###3176 The Icelandic state cannot take on any further debt whatsoever,
###3179 so this is very invasive type of debt covenance, if you will.
###3188 And as it turned out, very few people knew about it
###3193 in Iceland, and the prime minister did not even
###3197 disclose this information to the entire cabinet,
###3200 and as a result, he got indicted and brought
###3207 before the special court in Iceland that rules on breaches
###3212 on the part of ministers in Iceland-- Landsdomur,
###3214 it's called.
###3215 So for the first time in 100 years' history of that court,
###3219 the case was brought against him.
###3222 Now, now you know how all this happened, and why it happened.
###3227 So the next question is, why didn't anybody
###3229 stop this development?
###3231 And the short answer is, it was too rapid of a credit growth,
###3237 and there were too few people to handle all of this,
###3244 or rather, the main cause here is, basically
###3249 the politicians didn't acknowledge
###3251 the need for strong supervision.
###3255 If you're going to build your economic system on the pillars
###3259 of a financial institution's being one
###3261 of the main industries of the economy,
###3265 well, you need to have something to back it up,
###3270 or strong oversight, and there, the policymakers basically
###3275 failed in Iceland.
###3277 So we had the Financial Supervisory Authorities
###3281 doing financial oversight of something
###3283 that was 10 times the GDP of Iceland with only 36 employees.
###3288 And for a trained statistician, such as myself,
###3292 it was a shock to observe that no proper data-analysis
###3301 equipment were used.
###3303 Data was gathered in Excel sheets of 47 sheets
###3308 from each and every institution-- hundreds
###3311 of small and large financial institutions in Iceland,
###3314 and this was the data archiving and collection,
###3318 so it's impossible to have an oversight
###3321 under these circumstances.
###3324 So Financial Supervisory Authorities, in short, there
###3329 were lack of experience and incompetence,
###3332 lack of proper IT systems.
###3333 Tool and processes for data analysis weren't in place.
###3339 There was lack of authority and follow-up.
###3341 Cases were kept too informal for too long.
###3345 Violations of the law went unnoticed,
###3346 and law was not enforced.
###3349 Now, the Central Bank of Iceland did have some more insight
###3354 into the risk, and also a legal obligation
###3359 to ensure financial stability in the country.
###3362 
###3364 It, however, never formally or informally conveyed it
###3370 to the government what needed to be done to avert the risk,
###3374 and had it thought that they lacked the legal means to do
###3378 so, they did not report that either to the government.
###3384 Now, there were a host of tools in the policy toolbox
###3389 that could have been used, but were, in fact, not.
###3394 So one of the lessons-- and he put it very nicely out,
###3400 Thorarinn Petursson, senior economist of Central Bank,
###3403 the state of affairs in Iceland at the time--
###3405 "I think there is a fundamental misunderstanding of what
###3408 financial supervision is all about here in Iceland.
###3411 Not only at the FME, Financial Supervisory Authorities,
###3415 but also the Central Bank.
###3416 They thought that the role of these institutions
###3418 was to follow upon whether the letter of the law
###3421 was met by those under supervision.
###3423 So you are watching an entire financial system falling off
###3426 a cliff, and as long as you are following the law,
###3429 you are fine."
###3431 So one of the recommendations of the Turner review in Britain,
###3436 which was issued after their crisis,
###3438 is that the regulatory and supervisory coverage
###3441 should follow the principle of economic substance, and not
###3444 a legal form.
###3447 Just to inform you of the losses that
###3451 were incurred after the collapse, about five times
###3455 GDP was written off in a matter of four or five
###3457 months after the system collapsed,
###3463 and these delicate findings, or the challenges that we were
###3468 faced in the beginning, this special investigation
###3471 commission ruled that on the mistakes or negligence
###3477 by ministers and public officials in the period
###3480 leading up to the collapse of the banks,
###3482 the SIC is in the opinion that the Prime
###3484 Minister, the Minister of Finance,
###3486 the Minister of Business Affairs, Director
###3489 General of the FME, governors of the Central Bank of Iceland
###3492 showed negligence within the meaning of Article 1.1
###3496 of the law on the Special Investigation Commission.
###3501 And as I told you before, the prime minister
###3504 was found guilty on one count out of four of negligence
###3507 by a special court, Landsdomur.
###3510 Now, fraud or failure on part of the bankers
###3513 is still being decided.
###3515 Some of them have already received a sentence
###3518 on a regional level or a local court.
###3523 Management of Kaupthing has been sentenced
###3525 to three to five years in prison for fraudulent lending
###3528 practices and market manipulation.
###3531 They have appealed.
###3532 Cases are pending against the Landsbanki management for fraud
###3536 and market manipulation, and Larus Welding, CEO of Glitnir,
###3540 was found guilty, but acquitted by the Supreme Court.
###3545 Several other cases are pending against him.
###3548 The special prosecutor had over 200 cases in total.
###3553 58 are currently under investigation.
###3556 20 indictments-- 15 already brought
###3558 to court-- and eight cases have been
###3560 ruled upon against 46 individuals,
###3563 so this is already exceeding your legal efforts,
###3567 or prosecutional efforts, looking into savings and loans
###3572 crisis in the '80s.
###3574 Now, what can we learn?
###3576 
###3580 My husband is a human factors engineer,
###3582 and he has taught me how the human mind perceives things
###3587 inadequately, and one of the things
###3589 is that we seem not to be able to sense acceleration.
###3595 We all know the story when we are going over the speed limit,
###3598 and we withdraw to the legal limit,
###3601 we find that we are not moving at all.
###3604 Taking this into account, you don't put anybody
###3609 at the seat of the F-18, is it?
###3613 18, 19, 16?
###3615 Thank you-- unless he or she has several thousand hours
###3621 in the air.
###3622 So banks are like monstrous machines,
###3628 so you need people that have the proper training
###3631 and the proper insight, and also at the realm of the Financial
###3636 Supervisory Authorities.
###3638 So that said, it is very important
###3647 that, as you do here so well in America,
###3651 acknowledging the efforts that go into further education,
###3656 and, yeah, that's the aim-- to put
###3660 the right people at the right spot.
###3663 But another lesson is the importance of equity.
###3667 These monstrous institutions, the banks,
###3671 are running at the very low-equity ratio,
###3676 so there's not much room for their assets
###3678 to move downwards at all.
###3682 This is one thing-- I mean, now in Iceland we
###3685 have banks that are set up, or have a funding
###3690 mix of up to 25% equity, and it's
###3695 just that incentives become very risky,
###3705 let's say, or people engage in risky activities,
###3709 and it all depends on how they are incentivized.
###3712 So if you have your own money in an enterprise,
###3715 you behave very differently from where
###3718 you have no money of your own in the operation.
###3725 Another lesson is that bankers need
###3729 to understand that when they are lending money in the holding
###3732 companies, they have a claim on the residual claim.
###3740 So these structures that I showed you should theoretically
###3744 not be possible to construct, simply because if you take
###3749 into account that you, the bank, you
###3752 are lending the money for the equity part,
###3754 you should price it accordingly, so there should be no money
###3758 left on the table for the constructors
###3760 of these structures.
###3761 
###3764 So pricing obviously failed enormously
###3767 in the Icelandic banks.
###3771 Supervision should be built on [INAUDIBLE] substance.
###3774 We should try to have our legal framework set up in a way
###3778 that it supports potential policies that
###3783 need to be adjusted quickly.
###3788 The letter of the law is obviously fairly sticky.
###3794 It's difficult to change in a short period of time.
###3798 The medium-term effects in Iceland--
###3802 we had massive market manipulation on our hands.
###3805 People were not following the legal letter.
###3808 They were evading the rules and the law, so as a result,
###3813 we have a clear case where the markets break down.
###3818 They just disappear, and that is what happened.
###3821 The bond market was virtually non-functioning.
###3824 Stock market virtually disappeared.
###3827 There was no currency market right after the fall,
###3830 so in de facto, we had imposed capital controls
###3833 right after the collapse, because nobody
###3835 wanted to trade the Icelandic krona.
###3838 So there are a lot of small stories
###3840 to learn from, obviously, but I think
###3842 if there's only one that I can leave you with,
###3846 it is that we know how our system is interconnected.
###3852 It is a question whether you know
###3853 how your system is interconnected.
###3856 And now I am open for questions.
###3860 [APPLAUSE]
###3866 So to answer your question, which
###3867 was along the lines that, what happened
###3869 to the Icelandic people?
###3870 How many are unemployed, and so on, and so forth.
###3873 The short answer is, we had a spike in the unemployment
###3877 rate reaching 8%, 9%.
###3881 It has come down to 4%, roughly, now.
###3884 So we have had a history of very low unemployment in Iceland.
###3887 I mean, most of us had three or three or four jobs,
###3890 like you saw on my profile, but Iceland
###3897 has been portrayed, like here in the US media,
###3900 as a poster child of economic recovery after the crisis.
###3904 But I have to tell you, unfortunately,
###3905 that the judges haven't ruled on it yet.
###3910 We have still got the most challenge on our hand,
###3913 and that is to get rid of the capital
###3915 controls that were installed right after.
###3918 So, for example, if you're traveling abroad from Iceland,
###3920 you can only bring $3,000 or so for your rental car
###3926 and your hotel, and so on, and so forth,
###3928 so it's being sanctioned.
###3929 Currency is being sanctioned.
###3932 So net foreign direct investment is at a historic low.
###3938 Investment, in general, is very low,
###3940 so people are seeing their wages have
###3942 been cut in half in real terms.
###3946 Even nominal terms have been lowered.
###3949 
###3951 Government officials, for example,
###3954 haven't seen a raise in eight years,
###3957 so this is a big chunk of a person's life's work,
###3961 or of career, so we are not part of the woods yet.
###3969 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
###3970 GUDRUN JOHNSEN: They were primarily the loans
###3972 to holding companies that were just foam, or they were--
###3978 AUDIENCE: The holding companies didn't
###3979 want to be [INAUDIBLE], or what?
###3980 GUDRUN JOHNSEN: Yeah, they did.
###3982 The majority of them held the stocks of the banks themselves,
###3986 who became bankrupt, and then you had all this domino effect.
###3990 Most firms in Iceland have become technically bankrupt.
###3995 That has been the most challenge that we
###3997 have been faced with after the crash is to reorganize
###4000 and restructure the loan portfolios of the banks,
###4004 because more than every other loan of the portfolios
###4010 of the banks were nonperforming.
###4014 That's a very good question on how we kept politics out
###4018 of the reporting on the failures of the banks.
###4021 That's your question?
###4022 AUDIENCE: More or less.
###4023 I mean, we can't do that here.
###4025 How did you do it there?
###4027 GUDRUN JOHNSEN: I think that you might see different reactions
###4030 on part of your politicians if you
###4032 had your 97% of your banking sector collapse.
###4036 It's just such a severity of the situation that
###4039 did not allow for any scrutiny.
###4043 I mean, you can wonder about reasons
###4044 why the politicians, for example,
###4046 extended this type of data access.
###4049 I mean, this is unheard of that the one government that
###4052 has failed so miserably in their policy making actually
###4056 brings on themselves an investigation where
###4059 they can be exposed, and that is exactly what happened.
###4061 
###4065 But you've got to applaud this type of behavior
###4067 on part of the politicians.
###4069 
###4073 We're a small society.
###4076 We were a trusting bunch before the collapse,
###4080 and one of the guests that I had in the audience at one
###4085 of the financial institutions pointed out
###4088 that you need a healthy dose of mistrust in any system,
###4091 and that was lacking.
###4093 The mistrust was not enough, but now we
###4095 swung from the totally trusting system over to a full mistrust.
###4105 So there was a lot of scrutiny on part of the public.
###4109 Obviously we had a pots and pans revolution,
###4113 where people were banging on pots and pans
###4115 in front of Parliament, so that was not
###4116 much room for politicians to try to cast sand
###4123 into the eyes of the voting public.
###4127 In terms of incentives, the question
###4128 was, what type of prisons do you have,
###4131 where people involved in this sentence of guilty verdict--
###4136 where can they expect themselves to end up?
###4139 And one answer is, the length of the sentences in Iceland
###4147 are very short, so as it turns out,
###4151 we have had one case of insider trading
###4153 that has been ruled upon, and the person involved
###4156 has gone to jail for six months total.
###4160 The sentence was two years.
###4162 If you behave well in the prison,
###4164 you can get your sentence halved, and then you
###4166 can do community service for half of the remaining part,
###4173 so in this particular instance, the expected value
###4182 was positive, so--
###4185 AUDIENCE: And the conditions themselves are bad?
###4187 GUDRUN JOHNSEN: Oh, very nice.
###4189 [LAUGHTER]
###4191 You need to be trained to understand acceleration
###4194 and growth and what it means.
###4195 Lawyers, for example, are not trained in this way.
###4199 But the explanations need to be sought in the behavioral part,
###4208 and in small society, there's a big hurdle effect.
###4212 People were just cheering for those bankers,
###4214 and the government officials and the political leaders
###4218 were applauding the people who were in charge,
###4222 and so we basically risked being ridiculed,
###4228 and I was certainly one of those who had been doing research
###4233 on credit growth especially.
###4235 I pointed it out a year and a half before the banks failed,
###4239 and to tell you the truth, there was no reaction to it
###4242 whatsoever, so that's how that was.
###4248 Right, so what are the capital controls that
###4250 are in place, and what are they meant to prevent?
###4253 So they are meant to prevent a capital outflow of the country,
###4257 so if there are claims on the bankrupt estates, for one,
###4265 there are also foreign investors who own ISK-denominated bonds.
###4270 They want to get rid of their krona,
###4273 and buy foreign exchange for it, and leave the economy,
###4276 and if people do that massively, you
###4280 have a run on the bank situation.
###4283 So you want to prevent that to happen,
###4285 because if you allow that, the currency of the krona
###4288 will devalue, and most of mortgages in Iceland,
###4292 because we have had a history of high inflation in our economy,
###4296 they are index-linked, so they're
###4299 linked to the CPI index.
###4300 So if foreigners leave rapidly, the system-- the krona
###4305 devalues, and, for example, debt of corporates,
###4308 as well as households, will increase, as a result.
###4313 So you will have a turbulence-- probably nonperforming loans,
###4317 et cetera, so turbulence in the financial sector.
###4320 Financial instability is what you are trying to prevent.
###4324 Does it answer your question?
###4326 So thank you, everybody, for showing up here, and giving me
###4330 these great questions to answer-- inspiring questions.
###4332 Thank you so much.
###4333 [APPLAUSE]
