MATT FARAH: You know, people
talk about the golden age of


4
0:0:15,65 --> 0:0:19,1
muscle cars like it was 50 years
ago, like the last good


5
0:0:19,1 --> 0:0:23,24
muscle car Americans came out
with was in 1969 or '70.


6
0:0:23,24 --> 0:0:24,24
But I disagree.


7
0:0:24,24 --> 0:0:27,545
I think the golden age of muscle
cars is right now.


8
0:0:27,545 --> 0:0:31,79
The new Shelby GT 500
has 660 horsepower.


9
0:0:31,79 --> 0:0:35,39
The Camaro ZL1 has
580 horsepower.


10
0:0:35,39 --> 0:0:40,23
And even this CTS-V wagon
has 556 horsepower.


11
0:0:40,23 --> 0:0:43,24
Now, these two cars behind
me are pretty special.


12
0:0:43,24 --> 0:0:46,3
I mean, underneath, you have
very similar drivetrains.


13
0:0:46,3 --> 0:0:48,36
And it's a testament to General
Motors that they are


14
0:0:48,36 --> 0:0:51,4
willing to make this drivetrain
with either a


15
0:0:51,4 --> 0:0:53,94
Camaro body on it, or a station
wagon body on it,


16
0:0:53,94 --> 0:0:56,26
depending on what you want.


17
0:0:56,26 --> 0:0:59,9
We've come to Texas, and
as we know, everything


18
0:0:59,9 --> 0:1:0,76
is bigger in Texas.


19
0:1:0,76 --> 0:1:3,52
The portions of barbecue
are massive.


20
0:1:3,52 --> 0:1:5,47
The boobies are gigantic.


21
0:1:5,47 --> 0:1:9,4
And a man named John has a small
shop here, and he likes


22
0:1:9,4 --> 0:1:11,865
to build things that
go obscenely fast.

[ROCK MUSIC]


24
0:1:29,91 --> 0:1:31,5
JOHN HENNESSEY: You know, this
whole thing probably started


25
0:1:31,5 --> 0:1:35,61
as a kid, where my dad exposed
me to cars, and if a fast car


26
0:1:35,61 --> 0:1:37,72
was cool, a faster
car was better.


27
0:1:37,72 --> 0:1:42,87
And as I grew up and had my own
car, I bought a 442 Olds


28
0:1:42,87 --> 0:1:43,606
when I was 16.


29
0:1:43,606 --> 0:1:46,85
I bought it with my own money,
and it wasn't a day before I


30
0:1:46,85 --> 0:1:50,18
had the air lid flipped upside
down on the Quadro Dog


31
0:1:50,18 --> 0:1:52,16
carburetor trying to get
more power out of it.


32
0:1:52,16 --> 0:1:54,85
So I've been doing it for a
little over 20 years, started


33
0:1:54,85 --> 0:1:56,78
in 1991 as a hobby.


34
0:1:56,78 --> 0:1:59,73
Hobby got out of control, and
here we are, building probably


35
0:1:59,73 --> 0:2:4,52
300 to 350 cars a year for
clients all around the world.


36
0:2:4,52 --> 0:2:6,87
MATT FARAH: Now, this is
the HPE700 package.


37
0:2:6,87 --> 0:2:12,888
And what you get for that is
707 horsepower and 717


38
0:2:12,888 --> 0:2:14,56
pound-feet of torque.


39
0:2:14,56 --> 0:2:18,2
Now, you probably imagine that
feels great to drive.


40
0:2:18,2 --> 0:2:20,4
But wait till you hear
how it sounds.


41
0:2:20,4 --> 0:2:24,78



42
0:2:24,78 --> 0:2:26,3
Shall we?


43
0:2:26,3 --> 0:2:30,5



44
0:2:30,5 --> 0:2:32,8
The Camaro ZL1 is already
a massive


45
0:2:32,8 --> 0:2:34,69
improvement over the SS.


46
0:2:34,69 --> 0:2:37,93
Not only do you get the LSA
supercharged engine out of the


47
0:2:37,93 --> 0:2:41,22
CTS-V, you also get the
magnetic ride control


48
0:2:41,22 --> 0:2:44,52
suspension, which is just
about the best piece of


49
0:2:44,52 --> 0:2:46,88
hardware General Motors makes.


50
0:2:46,88 --> 0:2:49,89
So good that it's actually not
even really worth improving


51
0:2:49,89 --> 0:2:51,59
for a street car.


52
0:2:51,59 --> 0:2:53,91
If you wanted faster
lap times, maybe.


53
0:2:53,91 --> 0:2:58,6
But the ride is really
good, actually.


54
0:2:58,6 --> 0:3:1,42
I like how Hennessey makes
the power, too.


55
0:3:1,42 --> 0:3:4,38
It's not just crank
up the boost.


56
0:3:4,38 --> 0:3:5,59
Because that--


57
0:3:5,59 --> 0:3:8,4
yeah, you might get one or two
good passes, but once it gets


58
0:3:8,4 --> 0:3:11,26
heat soaked, your car
starts to slip.


59
0:3:11,26 --> 0:3:12,91

cam, headers, exhaust,


62
0:3:17,66 --> 0:3:19,73

63
0:3:19,73 --> 0:3:22,46
It's not even running that
much extra boost.


64
0:3:22,46 --> 0:3:26,976

horsepower way.

JOHN HENNESSEY: GMLS-based
motors are a


73
0:3:47,89 --> 0:3:49,51
great platform to modify.


74
0:3:49,51 --> 0:3:55,43
So new Corvette, Camaro, SL1,
Cadillac CTS-Vs. I'd say right


75
0:3:55,43 --> 0:3:59,84
now in the last 24 months, more
than 50% of our business


76
0:3:59,84 --> 0:4:4,83
is GM LS small-block
Chevy-based V8s.


77
0:4:4,83 --> 0:4:6,77
They're very easy to modify.


78
0:4:6,77 --> 0:4:9,67
They're very reliable when
they're modified.


79
0:4:9,67 --> 0:4:12,12
We've got the ability to do the
calibration, so they get


80
0:4:12,12 --> 0:4:13,5
great fuel economy.


81
0:4:13,5 --> 0:4:14,35
They drive like stock.


82
0:4:14,35 --> 0:4:17,1
And most of our packages up to
700 horsepower will offer a


83
0:4:17,1 --> 0:4:19,29
three-year, 36,000-mile
warranty.


84
0:4:19,29 --> 0:4:21,89
And I can only do that because
I've got the confidence that


85
0:4:21,89 --> 0:4:22,95
it's going to be reliable
and live.


86
0:4:22,95 --> 0:4:24,48
And the customer's going to be
able to drive it like they


87
0:4:24,48 --> 0:4:26,95
would drive an everyday
stock car.


88
0:4:26,95 --> 0:4:32,66



89
0:4:32,66 --> 0:4:35,5
I can drive around like
this all I want.


90
0:4:35,5 --> 0:4:36,815
And the car's going
to hold up.


91
0:4:36,815 --> 0:4:38,5
It's going to start when
I need it to start.


92
0:4:38,5 --> 0:4:43,14
And if I'm going to buy a
$55,000 SL1 Camaro, put


93
0:4:43,14 --> 0:4:46,18
another $20,00 into it with
Hennessey for all the


94
0:4:46,18 --> 0:4:49,43
upgrades, I'm $75,000
into a car.


95
0:4:49,43 --> 0:4:52,582
That car had better start
when I want it to start.


96
0:4:52,582 --> 0:4:59,7



97
0:4:59,7 --> 0:5:3,49
That was only 4,000
rpm, by the way.


98
0:5:3,49 --> 0:5:4,66
I need it to be reliable.


99
0:5:4,66 --> 0:5:6,27
I need it to get me where
I want to go.


100
0:5:6,27 --> 0:5:8,91
And the good news is, this
package comes with a


101
0:5:8,91 --> 0:5:12,39
three-year, 36,000-mile
warranty.


102
0:5:12,39 --> 0:5:14,35
So when it breaks, it's
on him, not you.


103
0:5:14,35 --> 0:5:17,59



104
0:5:17,59 --> 0:5:22,55
If you've got the money, and
you want to be eating ZR1s,


105
0:5:22,55 --> 0:5:25,7
this basically turns a
Camaro into a ZR1.


106
0:5:25,7 --> 0:5:34,8



107
0:5:34,8 --> 0:5:35,13
JOHN HENNESSEY: Every
car is different.


108
0:5:35,13 --> 0:5:36,65
I look at every car
as almost like a


109
0:5:36,65 --> 0:5:38,73
stock in a stock market.


110
0:5:38,73 --> 0:5:41,1
What potential does it have?


111
0:5:41,1 --> 0:5:45,73
If a new BMW M3 comes out,
and it's 414 horsepower,


112
0:5:45,73 --> 0:5:49,2
whatever's from the factory BMW,
I know, they take their


113
0:5:49,2 --> 0:5:50,82
cars, and they don't leave a
whole lot of meat on the bone.


114
0:5:50,82 --> 0:5:53,35
They tune their cars to where,
when you get it from the


115
0:5:53,35 --> 0:5:55,72
dealer, there's not a whole
lot of upside left.


116
0:5:55,72 --> 0:5:58,57
Whereas a lot of the Ford stuff,
GM stuff, a lot of


117
0:5:58,57 --> 0:6:1,95
American muscle car and sports
cars, typically there's a lot


118
0:6:1,95 --> 0:6:3,58
more room to add more power.


119
0:6:3,58 --> 0:6:7,64
And so, you look at the
LS-based motors.


120
0:6:7,64 --> 0:6:10,52
A Cadillac CTS-V, for instance,
comes in with 556


121
0:6:10,52 --> 0:6:11,56
horsepower.


122
0:6:11,56 --> 0:6:15,45
That platform goes up to 700,
750 horsepower super reliably.


123
0:6:15,45 --> 0:6:18,14
Now, you want to go beyond 700
or 750, then you need to look


124
0:6:18,14 --> 0:6:21,0
at pistons and rods and doing
additional upgrades that are a


125
0:6:21,0 --> 0:6:21,785
lot more expensive.


126
0:6:21,785 --> 0:6:24,38
You can do 1,000 horsepower, and
we'll offer warranty with


127
0:6:24,38 --> 0:6:25,3
that package.


128
0:6:25,3 --> 0:6:27,29
But every package
is different.


129
0:6:27,29 --> 0:6:30,99
It's our job to figure out, how
far can we go that we're


130
0:6:30,99 --> 0:6:35,75
not pushing over the edge
of reliability?


131
0:6:35,75 --> 0:6:37,95
MATT FARAH: John will tell you
that there are no downsides


132
0:6:37,95 --> 0:6:39,7
whatsoever to this package.


133
0:6:39,7 --> 0:6:41,86
And I agree with him, mostly.


134
0:6:41,86 --> 0:6:43,4
You see the exhaust?


135
0:6:43,4 --> 0:6:44,3
It's really loud.


136
0:6:44,3 --> 0:6:45,41
And that's coming from me.


137
0:6:45,41 --> 0:6:48,74
It's really, ridiculously,
ludicrously loud.


138
0:6:48,74 --> 0:6:53,3
It is so loud that I actually
felt bad about driving past


139
0:6:53,3 --> 0:6:55,28
people's houses while
road testing it.


140
0:6:55,28 --> 0:6:56,42
It's that loud.


141
0:6:56,42 --> 0:6:57,82
And then there's a cam.


142
0:6:57,82 --> 0:7:0,3
Now, a cam really wakes
up an LS engine.


143
0:7:0,3 --> 0:7:1,77
You get a lot more
power out of it.


144
0:7:1,77 --> 0:7:3,48
So I understand why
you'd want one.


145
0:7:3,48 --> 0:7:5,66
But you get the uneven,
lumpy idle.


146
0:7:5,66 --> 0:7:7,18
Now, some people love that.


147
0:7:7,18 --> 0:7:9,97
Other people think that in
between gears and while going


148
0:7:9,97 --> 0:7:13,42
between reverse and park and
drive or at a red light, it


149
0:7:13,42 --> 0:7:15,72
makes the car feel rough
and uncivilized.


150
0:7:15,72 --> 0:7:18,27
Now here, it's up to you to make
the choice if that's what


151
0:7:18,27 --> 0:7:19,6
you want from your car.


152
0:7:19,6 --> 0:7:26,18



153
0:7:26,18 --> 0:7:30,73
This car will go 185 miles an
hour in the standing mile,


154
0:7:30,73 --> 0:7:35,46
which, if you recall, is about
10 miles an hour faster than I


155
0:7:35,46 --> 0:7:38,246
went in a bone stock ZR1.


156
0:7:38,246 --> 0:7:41,1
So you know that even if you
can't do it right off the


157
0:7:41,1 --> 0:7:43,83
line, sooner or later
that power will


158
0:7:43,83 --> 0:7:45,94
make it to the ground.


159
0:7:45,94 --> 0:7:49,6
I would advise a set of sticky
tires for this car, though.


160
0:7:49,6 --> 0:7:56,299
Because 707 horsepower and 717
pounds of torque, I'll just


161
0:7:56,299 --> 0:7:57,549
blow them right off.


162
0:7:57,549 --> 0:8:2,865



163
0:8:2,865 --> 0:8:6,64
Now, the bad news for someone
like me is that, this car,


164
0:8:6,64 --> 0:8:7,82
it's hard to see out of.


165
0:8:7,82 --> 0:8:10,5
You can't wear a helmet in it.


166
0:8:10,5 --> 0:8:10,94
It looks cool.


167
0:8:10,94 --> 0:8:11,43
It does.


168
0:8:11,43 --> 0:8:12,6
I'll give them that.


169
0:8:12,6 --> 0:8:15,77
But for me, not so practical.


170
0:8:15,77 --> 0:8:18,4
Fortunately, back there,
we have the model of


171
0:8:18,4 --> 0:8:19,19
practicality.


172
0:8:19,19 --> 0:8:20,56
CTS-V wagon--


173
0:8:20,56 --> 0:8:26,51
seats five, same LSA engine,
same HPE700 package.


174
0:8:26,51 --> 0:8:28,25
You can get it for both cars.


175
0:8:28,25 --> 0:8:30,16
And that means same deal.


176
0:8:30,16 --> 0:8:34,669
707 horsepower, 717 pound-feet
of torque.


177
0:8:34,669 --> 0:8:39,809
And while pretty much everyone
that I know, anyway, would say


178
0:8:39,809 --> 0:8:45,13
that a 700-horsepower station
wagon is extremely cool, I


179
0:8:45,13 --> 0:8:49,32
think we should find out which
one is faster in a drag race.


180
0:8:49,32 --> 0:9:2,34



181
0:9:2,34 --> 0:9:4,2
All right, my favorite
time of day--


182
0:9:4,2 --> 0:9:5,29
drag racing time.


183
0:9:5,29 --> 0:9:6,2
We're done with the road.


184
0:9:6,2 --> 0:9:11,8
So HPE700 Camaro versus
your daily driver.


185
0:9:11,8 --> 0:9:12,38
JOHN HENNESSEY: They both
make similar power.


186
0:9:12,38 --> 0:9:14,274
The wagon actually probably
makes a tiny bit more power


187
0:9:14,274 --> 0:9:14,864
than the ZL1.


188
0:9:14,864 --> 0:9:16,19
The ZL1's a little
bit lighter.


189
0:9:16,19 --> 0:9:17,52
So it's going to be
a close race.


190
0:9:17,52 --> 0:9:19,76
MATT FARAH: And you drive at
your track all the time, and


191
0:9:19,76 --> 0:9:20,6
I've never driven here.


192
0:9:20,6 --> 0:9:20,944
JOHN HENNESSEY: I've
got a little bit of


193
0:9:20,944 --> 0:9:21,785
a home field advantage.


194
0:9:21,785 --> 0:9:23,1
MATT FARAH: Home field
advantage counts.


195
0:9:23,1 --> 0:9:24,82
But who cares, right?


196
0:9:24,82 --> 0:9:25,46
They're both fast.


197
0:9:25,46 --> 0:9:26,71
Let's go race.


198
0:9:26,71 --> 0:10:50,16



199
0:10:50,16 --> 0:10:51,4
MALE SPEAKER: This is
John, me, Thad,


200
0:10:51,4 --> 0:10:52,75

County, on the other

MATT FARAH: Are people
calling in?


222
0:11:41,85 --> 0:11:43,72

we were stealing stuff.

0:11:44,93 --> 0:11:45,445
POLICE OFFICER: No, it's
the three cars.


225
0:11:45,445 --> 0:11:46,26
It wasn't noise.

0:11:46,26 --> 0:11:47,12

0:11:52,72 --> 0:11:53,66
POLICE OFFICER: You won't
hear from us.


236
0:11:53,66 --> 0:11:55,33

someone else, right?

0:11:55,33 --> 0:11:55,63
