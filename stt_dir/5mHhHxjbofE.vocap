###3 <i>Since I was a kid I've been able</i> <i>to sleep through anything,</i>
###6 <i>Storms sirens you name it,</i>
###8 <i>Last night I didn't sleep,</i>
###12 <i>Couldn't stop thinking</i> <i>about this past year,</i>
###17 Oh, please. l've seen you naked before.
###20 Dude, you had that? Five up high for cherry pie!
###26 You find it funny, Dr Dorian? Why don't you tell me
###28 the EKG findings of Wolff- Parkinson-White Syndrome?
###32 l haven't even showered yet.
###33 We could shower together for old time's sake.
###36 l never would've slept with you if l knew you were Dr Cox's ex.
###40 What was that, newbie?
###43 Relax. He doesn't know.
###46 He likes Carla anyway.
###48 l got Carla wrapped around my finger.
###50 l heard that!
###52 - What are you guys talking about? - Nothing.
###54 - Thank you. - Forget about it.
###57 No, no, no. You can't forget about these.
###61 l'd pull those hands back if you wanna keep 'em, Q-tip.
###65 That's just the kind of thing
###67 that can be construed as sexual harassment.
###70 Got a few hairs in the sink, there, huh?
###73 For God's sake, man, don't comb so hard.
###77 All right, enough is enough!
###87 l guess l don't fit in with your mirror friends.
###90 Enjoy.
###96 <i>I don't know why my mind</i> <i>is all over the place,</i>
###99 <i>Maybe it's because today</i> <i>isn't just any other day,</i>
###103 <i>It's my last day as an intern,</i>
###105 Oh, you got me!
###108 Let me go, let me go!
###110 Hey, amigos!
###111 Can you guys believe this?
###113 Tomorrow, we are officially residents.
###116 Let's get our last day on.
###118 <i>What the hell?</i> <i>He deserves it too,</i>
###123 Mother...
###137 Mr Bober has been complaining of abdominal pain and nausea.
###141 - Looks like cholecystitis. - What, newbie?
###143 This gentleman is suffering from an inflamed gallbladder
###146 and you have him eating a grilled cheese sandwich.
###149 Here's an idea. Why don't we just have him
###152 wash the whole thing down with a big ol' mug of vodka?
###156 Mr Bober back there is one of our frequent flyers.
###159 He's with us every six months for years and l've grown fond of him.
###162 So if you could somehow manage to not kill him,
###165 well, then, oh, gee, that would just be ducky.
###168 How come you haven't mentioned it's my last day as an intern?
###171 Haven't l?
###173 - Come here. Oh! - OK. OK.
###176 Despite the fact that tomorrow you will be a resident,
###179 you'll still be the excitable girl that you are now.
###182 The only difference will be that some new intern
###185 will mistake you for somebody who actually knows something.
###188 <i>Why is he so uptight today?</i>
###190 - Hey, Perry. - <i>Oh OK,</i>
###192 Jordan. To what do we owe the horror?
###195 Come on, Perry.
###196 No soft spot for the one woman who slept with you sober?
###199 Now, if you could sign this insurance physical,
###202 l'll go back to trying to forget that horrible, horrible night.
###205 For me to sign this, l would have to give you a physical.
###208 And when l say ''l,''
###210 l, of course, mean absolutely anybody but me.
###213 Barbie! Give my ex-wife here a physical,
###216 and don't be afraid of that third eye on her chest.
###220 Just remember, it's just as scared of you as you are of it.
###227 Let's get physical?
###231 - Doesn't matter... - Carla, can you do me a favour?
###234 Mr Bober needs yet another Foley catheter. l am so swamped.
###238 Sure, no problem. But we're not finished yet!
###240 l know we're not finished yet.
###242 l didn't say we were finished yet. But, baby, it's up to you.
###246 <i>When a couple argues</i>
###247 <i>you should run</i> <i>before you get roped in,</i>
###249 Hey, JD.
###253 - You got him, baby. - l got him.
###255 - l got him! - Bring him in.
###258 We were talking about our relationship and how great everything is.
###261 l said, ''lt's weird to think l'll never date again.''
###264 That's close, but not quite what you said.
###266 What you said was, ''lt's weird to think l'll never get to date again.''
###270 You see that? ''Get to date again'', like she's missing out.
###273 - How messed up is that? - l did not say ''get''.
###276 You're being ridiculous. What do you think, JD?
###278 <i>Careful Tiger, Careful,</i>
###282 l wish people would call me Tiger.
###284 What?
###285 l agree with Laverne.
###295 Damn kids and their stupid problems.
###297 l just wanna get home to a warm bath, catch a little bit of that <i>Fear Factor,</i>
###305 Ted, the reason we're not admiring the new parking structure
###309 is because you failed to get legal clearance from the zoning board.
###315 Honestly, sometimes l wonder if you're happy here.
###325 Do it, Ted. Just do it.
###328 Bob! When l heard you were up on the roof
###330 l just assumed it was because your evil mission
###333 here on planet Earth had finally come to an end, so tell me this.
###336 Where exactly is the mother ship?
###338 - Look, Ted. lt's Dr Cox. - Hey.
###340 l just saw the new shift schedule. Give me a break, will you?
###344 l'm glad you're here. The hospital needs a new Residency Director
###347 and l've decided to recommend you.
###349 Now, finish your tantrum on your own,
###352 because l'm going to go down to the cafeteria and get myself a fro-yo.
###356 Ted, chop-chop.
###359 Save my spot.
###362 Bambi, Mr Bober's hypotensive. l think he's becoming septic.
###365 This guy is more work than all my other patients combined.
###368 Maybe if you tell him how hard it is on you, he'll get better!
###372 l'll get paper towels.
###374 Don't worry. Somebody else will get it.
###377 Yeah. Who can we get?
###379 l'm not shocked. That's how you live your life.
###381 Got a problem? Hey, just pass it on down the line.
###384 <i>I was gonna say something</i>
###385 <i>but it turns out</i> <i>he gave me a pretty good idea,</i>
###389 Thank you so much for taking Bober from me.
###391 - But, JD, l... - l owe you.
###395 <i>I'm a little doormat</i> <i>I sit and stay</i>
###398 <i>Let people use me</i> <i>every single day</i>
###401 Excuse me?
###403 Oh, it's a song l'm working on. l made it up.
###407 So l let myself get taken advantage of sometimes, you know?
###410 l mean, big deal. How do you make friends?
###412 l've seen your type before.
###414 You're that girl that thought she wanted to lose her virginity
###417 at a party while another guy was asleep in the room.
###420 Chaz really cared for me.
###422 And l'm sure you have a cool T-shirt to prove it.
###425 Can we please finish this physical?
###427 And l can't pee right now, so you'll have to go for me.
###433 What a good girl. Good girl.
###436 <i>Still Elliot wasn't gonna let herself</i> <i>get stuck with Mr Bober either,</i>
###440 - How you doing, Mr Bober? - Fine.
###443 OK, why did you let Elliot turf him up here?
###445 l don't know.
###447 All l really remember is she dropped her pen and bent over.
###450 Dude, thong city!
###453 No. No high-five for you.
###456 - Todd did bad? - Todd did very bad.
###459 Todd did very, very bad.
###461 What the hell, Elliot?
###463 You can't just pawn this Bober guy off on me.
###465 lt was JD's patient! l was just the middleman. Woman. Person.
###468 We can stand here and argue about who screwed who.
###471 Or?
###472 Or nothing. l'm on break. Let's do it.
###474 - Rock-paper-scissors right now. - Fine. Loser gets Bober.
###478 Once, twice, three, shoot!
###480 Did you say Bober?
###482 l'm looking for my grandfather, Frank Bober.
###484 We moved him to the lCU, dear. He'll show you up.
###490 That's OK. She... She didn't hear us.
###492 No, but Jesus did.
###495 <i>Just a closer walk with thee</i>
###502 l didn't appreciate your game this morning.
###505 Heavens to Betsy, the gazpacho is scrumptious today.
###508 Dangling that fake promotion in front of me.
###511 l was dead serious about the Residency Director's position.
###514 Well, what makes you think that l'd be interested in that?
###518 Because you want my job,
###520 and you'll never get it without this on your résumé.
###523 But you hate me.
###525 - Like nuts in brownies, captain. - l don't get your angle.
###529 What could you want in exchange for my support,
###532 because l'm telling you, l am not dating that daughter of yours.
###535 l only have a son.
###538 That's my bad. l was just going by that picture on your desk.
###541 You know the financial burdens l deal with.
###544 l want you to stop busting my chops all the time and get on my team.
###547 - Forget about it. - Fine. Walk away.
###555 Scrumptious.
###558 Wanna bite?
###560 We're doctors. That's how doctors talk to doctors.
###563 Our only mistake was not being careful about where we were.
###566 We agree we did nothing wrong,
###568 so let's check in on him and forget about it.
###571 <i>And that's when</i> <i>the three of us realized</i>
###573 <i>even though we'd all</i> <i>spent time with Mr Bober</i>
###576 <i>none of us had any idea</i> <i>what he looked like,</i>
###579 Over here.
###583 Hey, guys.
###590 <i>When we started here a year ago</i>
###592 <i>and saw some of the</i> <i>insensitive and jaded doctors</i>
###595 <i>we all said the same thing:</i>
###596 <i>''That's not gonna be me, ''</i>
###599 <i>Really the only solace</i>
###600 <i>is that the guilt</i> <i>passes pretty quickly,</i>
###620 What's wrong, dog?
###622 You guys, we have to do something.
###624 lf we remove Mr Bober's gallbladder, it should relieve the abdominal pain.
###628 lsn't he a little old for that procedure?
###630 - Well, he seems stable enough. - Problem is, he has no insurance.
###636 <i>And then all at once</i> <i>we realized we had to do something,</i>
###643 <i>We decided to attack</i> <i>the problem on three fronts,</i>
###647 Dr Cox?
###652 Ms Sullivan?
###659 Dr Wen?
###661 l thought if you looked at Mr Bober's chart and agreed,
###664 you might be able to pull some strings or...
###666 <i>And now here it comes:</i> <i>The calling me a girl's name</i>
###669 <i>the telling me</i> <i>not to waste my time,,,</i>
###672 Yep. l'll be more than glad to help you there, Charlotte.
###675 <i>I was half right,</i>
###677 Well, thank you.
###679 Don't ever be afraid to come to me with stuff like that.
###682 The simple fact that you seem to give a crap
###684 is the reason l took an interest in you to begin with.
###687 lt's why l trust you as a doctor. Hell, it's...
###691 lt's why l trust you as a person.
###697 Are you dying?
###699 l've got a new shrink.
###704 <i>Ah just say it,</i>
###706 You know, l want to thank you for this whole year.
###708 Oh, no.
###710 And l just want to know if l can buy you dinner.
###713 That'd be terrific.
###715 - Great! l'm off in a half hour... - Oh, no!
###718 Here l was led to believe that you were...
###721 ...doing a gift certificate kind of thing.
###723 But to sit and eat with you? That's...
###727 That's just... That's crazy talk.
###730 l have half a mind to issue you a drug test.
###733 - Come on! What'd l sign up for... - Would've been nice.
###737 He doesn't have insurance. lf you could talk to the board, JD thought maybe...
###741 First he dumps that patient on you,
###743 and now he wants you to ask me a favour?
###745 lf you don't start saying no,
###747 you're gonna wind up on the playing a game
###749 - l call Hide The Pickle. - JD and l are just colleagues.
###752 l was joking, but you actually slept with him, didn't you?
###757 A little.
###758 l don't know where your mother was when she should've told you these things,
###762 but you cannot have sex with someone you care about.
###765 Sex is for making babies and revenge.
###767 Oh, you're so full of it.
###771 Listen, stick, if you wanna wipe your nose
###774 and pretend that was a sneeze, l will play along.
###777 But if you have something to say, say it.
###782 Everybody knows you're sleeping with Dr Cox,
###784 and it can't be about making babies, cos you'd end up eating them.
###788 As for revenge, l'm not sure that pleasuring him
###790 while he watches <i>SportsCenter</i> hurts him as much as you think.
###793 You still care about him whether you admit it or not.
###796 And if you lay one finger on me, l'm blowing my rape whistle.
###807 Kiss her?
###812 So you see, Dr Wen, it's not really a favour.
###814 We were supposed to do surgery on Mrs Beckerman, but she passed away.
###819 Go on.
###821 She's dead, and we hoped that you could keep her name on the roster.
###825 We don't wanna do surgery on her.
###826 Let's face it, Dr Wen. We're good, but we're not that good.
###830 - You know what l'm saying? - No.
###832 We want to get a patient approved for surgery.
###835 We hope you can keep the slot open.
###837 Oh, sure.
###838 Dr Turk, next time you need to talk to me,
###841 think hard about what you want to say, then send her.
###844 - Of course. Thanks, Dr Wen. - See, what happened there was,
###847 l knew what you were trying to say despite the exact words you were using.
###851 l tried to help you out instead of getting mad at you over nothing.
###855 Baby, we both know it's not the same.
###858 You are the dumbest man l ever laid eyes on.
###863 Still.
###867 Didn't hurt! Didn't hurt!
###870 Tell me if it hurts this time!
###872 So, you want me to approve surgery on a 76-year-old man
###876 with no insurance and no life-threatening condition?
###879 Young man, l'm curious.
###881 What did you think the end result of this conversation would be?
###885 Well, pretty much, this.
###886 Except l'm invested, so l thought l might try crying.
###889 Sport, if crying worked on me,
###891 my wife would have her own car by now.
###898 - Bob? l think you should reconsider. - What's that, Perry?
###903 l mean, because that didn't sound like something a teammate would say.
###907 Maybe you meant to pat me on the ass and say, ''Go get 'em, Bob.''
###911 Right, but what if we were to look at this
###913 from a purely fiscal perspective?
###916 <i>Did he just say ''fiscal''?</i>
###918 After all, Mr Bober is here every four to six months,
###921 and if we were to consider his surgery
###924 as a one-time expenditure, then...
###927 ...you would be making the right financial call.
###930 See now? That's the kind of thinking l can get behind!
###935 How'd that make you feel?
###937 - Dirty all over. - You get used to it.
###940 Boys, l'll do what l can, but if you're gonna pull this off,
###943 you're gonna need a board member behind you.
###945 <i>How the hell</i> <i>are we supposed to get that?</i>
###948 This is the closest l've come
###951 to not hating myself after sleeping with you.
###954 Oh, you're just saying that.
###956 Actually, l'm not. l... We connected.
###962 - What's wrong with you? - Nothing.
###965 l guess l was just thinking of a guy l kind of like.
###969 Let me guess.
###971 He is an arrogant, self-hating narcissist who just needs to be loved.
###977 - Yeah, pretty much. - Nobody better.
###982 Hey, stud?
###984 Thank you for not asking me to help on the Bober thing.
###987 l would've, but it would've been pointless.
###989 Turns out, you're a very predictable woman there.
###992 - Please. - l know you.
###995 You're gonna walk into that boardroom tonight all tall and strong,
###999 and then you're gonna sit back and just pray that nobody asks your opinion.
###1004 l mean, l'm sure you probably think
###1006 that your little visits here are a spontaneous surprise,
###1009 but did you ever wonder why the only two candles l own
###1012 are already lit when you walk in that door?
###1014 l mean, doll, l hate to tell you this, but l don't walk around
###1017 all day with cologne down in my engine room.
###1020 l'm not that guy.
###1023 Some people like reliability.
###1025 ln a sedan, it turns out it's terrific.
###1028 Cheers. Here's the good news, however.
###1034 Turns out it's never too late to turn the whole thing around.
###1038 Really?
###1039 All you gotta do is stir it up a little bit.
###1042 - Stir it up? - Stir it right the hell up.
###1045 - l'll try to remember that. - So l'm guessing
###1049 l'll be seeing you in about 1 1 days, right?
###1054 Probably at the exact same time.
###1058 Don't forget to stir it up, baby.
###1064 <i>And so it comes down to this</i>
###1066 <i>the hospital board meeting</i> <i>to decide Mr Bober's fate,</i>
###1070 <i>And in a weird way ours too,</i>
###1101 <i>As cheesy as it sounds</i>
###1103 <i>I think we knew</i> <i>we were all gonna be OK,</i>
###1106 Hi, Mr Bober.
###1108 <i>Still I've had this feeling</i> <i>that I'm forgetting something,</i>
###1111 Hey!
###1113 Congratulations on becoming a resident.
###1115 Glad l could help.
###1117 Help? You were awful to me.
###1120 You... awful.
###1122 Anyway, go get 'em, tiger.
###1126 The world is your oyster, my friend. What?
###1131 lt's my first day. l'm waiting for someone.
###1135 This door is broke.
###1136 Every fifth time or so, it don't open.
###1139 Maybe there's a paper clip stuck in there.
###1144 - Why a paper clip? - l was just making small talk.
###1147 - Did you put a paper clip in there? - No.
###1151 lf l find a paper clip...
###1154 ...you're goin' down.
###1157 - Here's to the new residents! - Here, here!
###1160 - l'm a doctor! - <i>It's been a long year</i>
###1162 <i>but the important thing is</i> <i>we got through it together,</i>
###1165 - <i>We were a family,</i> - Hey, everyone.
###1168 - Oh, hi. - How are you?
###1171 Ms Sullivan, thank you for helping us with Mr Bober.
###1174 Don't mention it. Even though l wasn't invited to your party,
###1177 - l brought presents for everyone. - Brace yourself, newbie.
###1181 Carla, my ex-husband is in love with you.
###1183 lt's true. Ask your boyfriend. He knows.
###1186 He and Perry talk about it all the time.
###1188 l don't know why you haven't mentioned this to her.
###1191 Perhaps you're afraid of something. Huh.
###1194 And, Bob, when are you gonna tell Perry that that promotion
###1197 you're making him jump through hoops for was filled months ago?
###1201 lt just seems wrong. Which brings us to Twinkie.
###1205 lf you don't have the courage to tell your ''colleague'' Dr Dorian
###1209 that you're still crazy about him,
###1211 l'm gonna do it for you, cos that's what friends do. Yeah.
###1214 And finally, Perry,
###1217 you are not gonna believe what happened
###1220 the first time l met your little protégé here.
###1222 <i>Oh please God no,</i>
###1225 l slept with him, and it was good.
###1229 How's that for stirring things up?
###1232 Have a great summer, everyone. Bye.
###1275 <i>Yup, One big happy family,</i> �
