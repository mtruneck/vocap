###9 ALICE: We went to Japan to meet Takako of Cat Prin, the
###11 world's premier feline cat tailor.
###13 Takako was sick some years ago.
###17 And she all of a sudden said that one day she had this
###20 dream where God came down and told her, you need to make
###23 clothes for cats.
###24 And that's what she did, and it became
###26 hugely popular in Japan.
###28 She spends all day designing cat clothes, and she dresses
###30 up her cats.
###31 We decided to put out a book of her creations called
###34 Fashion Cats, it came out last year.
###36 Check it out under the description below.
###37 And now here it is, The Cute Show.
