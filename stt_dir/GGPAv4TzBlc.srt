0:0:3,83 --> 0:0:6,97
CHARLET: Welcome to Fashion
Week Internationale, a new


3
0:0:6,97 --> 0:0:9,95
show that reports on the most
fabulous fashion weeks in the


4
0:0:9,95 --> 0:0:14,61
world, and the culture and
politics behind them.


5
0:0:14,61 --> 0:0:18,43
Next up, we head to Sin City in
search of some of that old


6
0:0:18,43 --> 0:0:19,68
Vegas magic.


7
0:0:19,68 --> 0:0:26,13



8
0:0:26,13 --> 0:0:28,84
This is me in the back of a
pickup truck in the middle of


9
0:0:28,84 --> 0:0:30,61
the Nevada desert.


10
0:0:30,61 --> 0:0:33,8
We were on our way to Las Vegas
for something called the


11
0:0:33,8 --> 0:0:37,74
International Lingerie Show, an
event billed as a three-day


12
0:0:37,74 --> 0:0:41,2
spectacular showcasing the
latest in cutting edge


13
0:0:41,2 --> 0:0:42,47
lingerie design.


14
0:0:42,47 --> 0:0:45,38
Before we left, a friend of
mine, the celebrated fashion


15
0:0:45,38 --> 0:0:49,17
photographer Alice Hawkins, said
I must make a stop at her


16
0:0:49,17 --> 0:0:52,64
friend Mark Hayward's house
in Tecopa, Death Valley.


17
0:0:52,64 --> 0:0:55,68
Mark had spent a lot of time
in the city but found it


18
0:0:55,68 --> 0:0:58,2
overwhelming, and so disappeared
into the desert to


19
0:0:58,2 --> 0:1:0,17
live a life of solitude.


20
0:1:0,17 --> 0:1:3,0
Alice told me he'd have some
sagely advice about Vegas


21
0:1:3,0 --> 0:1:7,24
which would be invaluable
to our trip.


22
0:1:7,24 --> 0:1:10,79
How would you feel if you had
to go to Vegas tomorrow and


23
0:1:10,79 --> 0:1:12,43
walk around the strip?


24
0:1:12,43 --> 0:1:15,34
MARK: I'd feel like
I was in hell.


25
0:1:15,34 --> 0:1:18,15
It's like walking
through hell.


26
0:1:18,15 --> 0:1:22,46
You go into the city, and in
a few hours' time, all your


27
0:1:22,46 --> 0:1:26,76
finest sensitivities
are blunted.


28
0:1:26,76 --> 0:1:29,69
You begin to feel more
and more inhuman.


29
0:1:29,69 --> 0:1:32,92
More like a robot.


30
0:1:32,92 --> 0:1:35,22
Sex is very powerful.


31
0:1:35,22 --> 0:1:39,81
We should always beware and feel
a deep reverence for the


32
0:1:39,81 --> 0:1:41,65
power of sex.


33
0:1:41,65 --> 0:1:44,21
It's the source of all
our creativity.


34
0:1:44,21 --> 0:1:47,252
Either way, it can bring
it to a downfall.


35
0:1:47,252 --> 0:1:55,7



36
0:1:55,7 --> 0:1:57,88
CHARLET: The Vegas economy
is currently ranked


37
0:1:57,88 --> 0:2:0,31
worst in the nation.


38
0:2:0,31 --> 0:2:2,98
Local industry has gone to great
pains to keep the money


39
0:2:2,98 --> 0:2:5,8
coming in, and nowhere is this
more apparent than in the


40
0:2:5,8 --> 0:2:8,11
field of adult entertainment.


41
0:2:8,11 --> 0:2:10,789
The extravagant glamour of
years gone by has been


42
0:2:10,789 --> 0:2:13,98
replaced by a stripped-down
version, where less has


43
0:2:13,98 --> 0:2:15,24
definitely become more.


44
0:2:15,24 --> 0:2:20,78



45
0:2:20,78 --> 0:2:24,56
So I have a bit of a personal
love affair with lingerie


46
0:2:24,56 --> 0:2:27,52
because when I was at uni, I
worked part time for three


47
0:2:27,52 --> 0:2:29,89
years in Agent Provocateur.


48
0:2:29,89 --> 0:2:31,27
I know everything
about lingerie.


49
0:2:31,27 --> 0:2:33,31
There's nothing you
can teach me.


50
0:2:33,31 --> 0:2:35,505
I've got enough knickers
to last me a lifetime.


51
0:2:35,505 --> 0:2:40,312
But maybe where lingerie is at
now has changed, so let's see.


52
0:2:40,312 --> 0:2:45,51



53
0:2:45,51 --> 0:2:49,7
The moment I stepped into the
badly lit exhibition center, I


54
0:2:49,7 --> 0:2:50,87
realized this was about
as far away from


55
0:2:50,87 --> 0:2:54,144
sexy as could be imagined.


56
0:2:54,144 --> 0:2:55,48
So this is Dennis.


57
0:2:55,48 --> 0:3:0,41
He's lived in Vegas
for 11 years.


58
0:3:0,41 --> 0:3:2,3
DENNIS: I've been coming to
the International Lingerie


59
0:3:2,3 --> 0:3:4,77
Show for three years now.


60
0:3:4,77 --> 0:3:7,93
I've attended a lot of the other
adult-oriented shows.


61
0:3:7,93 --> 0:3:10,94
These are some of the samples
that this booth is nice enough


62
0:3:10,94 --> 0:3:11,78
to give out.


63
0:3:11,78 --> 0:3:13,89
And they make excellent
quality garments.


64
0:3:13,89 --> 0:3:15,29
CHARLET: Which pink?


65
0:3:15,29 --> 0:3:16,68
DENNIS: Oh, this pink
right here.


66
0:3:16,68 --> 0:3:17,2
CHARLET: Why?


67
0:3:17,2 --> 0:3:18,91
MARK: Something dynamic
that stands out.


68
0:3:18,91 --> 0:3:22,575
This is Las Vegas, and you want
to be colorful and bright


69
0:3:22,575 --> 0:3:26,954
and make the right impression
in Las Vegas.


70
0:3:26,954 --> 0:3:28,45
CHARLET: Do you like thongs?


71
0:3:28,45 --> 0:3:30,5
DENNIS: I love thongs,
absolutely.


72
0:3:30,5 --> 0:3:32,3
Now for me, a thong
covers a bit too


73
0:3:32,3 --> 0:3:35,96
much, but they're nice.


74
0:3:35,96 --> 0:3:39,2
They're quite fond of offering
you a piece of ass here.


75
0:3:39,2 --> 0:3:40,56
Am I right?


76
0:3:40,56 --> 0:3:41,81
CHARLET: I'm eating ass.


77
0:3:41,81 --> 0:3:45,3



78
0:3:45,3 --> 0:3:47,9
DENNIS: Right here is one
of the newer ones.


79
0:3:47,9 --> 0:3:49,44
They have some of the state
of the art stuff.


80
0:3:49,44 --> 0:3:51,626
They also have devices
for the gentleman.


81
0:3:51,626 --> 0:3:55,93
The pleasure flesh is very
close to the real thing.


82
0:3:55,93 --> 0:3:57,33
CHARLET: Have you ever tried
anything like that?


83
0:3:57,33 --> 0:3:58,41
Do you speak from experience?


84
0:3:58,41 --> 0:4:0,928
DENNIS: Oh, I speak from
a great experience.


85
0:4:0,928 --> 0:4:10,2



86
0:4:10,2 --> 0:4:13,113
CHARLET: This stall seems to
be bona fide lingerie.


87
0:4:13,113 --> 0:4:15,77



88
0:4:15,77 --> 0:4:18,105
This is unusual lingerie.


89
0:4:18,105 --> 0:4:21,242



90
0:4:21,242 --> 0:4:22,63
Is this a bra or underwear?


91
0:4:22,63 --> 0:4:23,73
FEMALE SPEAKER: That would
be crotchless.


92
0:4:23,73 --> 0:4:24,65
CHARLET: Oh, yes.


93
0:4:24,65 --> 0:4:25,38
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes.


94
0:4:25,38 --> 0:4:26,872
CHARLET: Can we talk
about this?


95
0:4:26,872 --> 0:4:29,132
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, yeah.


96
0:4:29,132 --> 0:4:30,46
CHARLET: Is this for women?


97
0:4:30,46 --> 0:4:31,98
FEMALE SPEAKER: No, this
is for the boys.


98
0:4:31,98 --> 0:4:34,12
They have quite a
few of these.


99
0:4:34,12 --> 0:4:36,85
They've got an elephant,
they have a candy cane.


100
0:4:36,85 --> 0:4:38,846
CHARLET: Is this to make it--


101
0:4:38,846 --> 0:4:41,618
your bits look less
intimidating?


102
0:4:41,618 --> 0:4:44,46
FEMALE SPEAKER: I just hope
they can fill it up.


103
0:4:44,46 --> 0:4:46,27
CHARLET: This is Andrew,
Mr. Gorgeous.


104
0:4:46,27 --> 0:4:46,522
ANDREW: Yes.


105
0:4:46,522 --> 0:4:48,455
I just got in from a fun
night of partying.


106
0:4:48,455 --> 0:4:49,75
I feel amazing.


107
0:4:49,75 --> 0:4:53,85
I'm here to model my friend's
skin line called Skin Couture,


108
0:4:53,85 --> 0:4:55,71
which is what I have
right here.


109
0:4:55,71 --> 0:4:59,76
CHARLET: It says "Every saint
has a past, every sinner has a


110
0:4:59,76 --> 0:5:2,955
future." What's going
on on your butt?


111
0:5:2,955 --> 0:5:4,2
It says Don't.


112
0:5:4,2 --> 0:5:5,37
Is that a tease,
like oh don't?


113
0:5:5,37 --> 0:5:6,52
Or is it actually don't?


114
0:5:6,52 --> 0:5:8,31
ANDREW: It's don't, like
I'm not easy like that.


115
0:5:8,31 --> 0:5:8,7
Don't.


116
0:5:8,7 --> 0:5:10,7
Get away, I'm not available
like that.


117
0:5:10,7 --> 0:5:12,64
But I like the bathing suit.


118
0:5:12,64 --> 0:5:13,89
CHARLET: Ah.


119
0:5:13,89 --> 0:5:17,1



120
0:5:17,1 --> 0:5:18,31
What is this company that
you're modeling for?


121
0:5:18,31 --> 0:5:19,43
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well, the
company is called Shibue


122
0:5:19,43 --> 0:5:21,57
Couture, and it's the first
strapless panty.


123
0:5:21,57 --> 0:5:24,35
It's a silicone-based
adhesive miracle.


124
0:5:24,35 --> 0:5:30,25



125
0:5:30,25 --> 0:5:31,3
CHARLET: Ah!


126
0:5:31,3 --> 0:5:32,28
FEMALE SPEAKER: Stays on.


127
0:5:32,28 --> 0:5:35,552



128
0:5:35,552 --> 0:5:37,997
Sometimes you like a little
bit of modesty,


129
0:5:37,997 --> 0:5:39,464
just a little bit.


130
0:5:39,464 --> 0:5:39,83
MALE SPEAKER: [YELLING]


131
0:5:39,83 --> 0:5:40,442
$5 samples!


132
0:5:40,442 --> 0:5:42,4
Come and get them!


133
0:5:42,4 --> 0:5:43,95
CHARLET: I thought you
said blow jobs.


134
0:5:43,95 --> 0:5:46,45
So, no blow jobs?


135
0:5:46,45 --> 0:5:48,524
MALE SPEAKER: Well, now that
you're here, we could probably


136
0:5:48,524 --> 0:5:49,7
arrange something.


137
0:5:49,7 --> 0:5:53,35
Can I take a bathroom
break, boss?


138
0:5:53,35 --> 0:5:54,8
CHARLET: Bye!


139
0:5:54,8 --> 0:5:57,171
MALE SPEAKER: All talk
and no action.


140
0:5:57,171 --> 0:6:0,53
CHARLET: I wasn't exactly
impressed by what I'd seen.


141
0:6:0,53 --> 0:6:4,21
If this was how far lingerie
had come, I was depressed.


142
0:6:4,21 --> 0:6:7,68
When three giant plasters
actually constitute lingerie,


143
0:6:7,68 --> 0:6:9,66
I think you've hit
rock bottom.


144
0:6:9,66 --> 0:6:17,62



145
0:6:17,62 --> 0:6:20,32
During the expo, one thing
did catch my eye.


146
0:6:20,32 --> 0:6:23,53
Nestled in between all the sex
toys and crotchless panties


147
0:6:23,53 --> 0:6:27,23
was a poster for something
called the LFL, or Lingerie


148
0:6:27,23 --> 0:6:28,76
Football League.


149
0:6:28,76 --> 0:6:31,16
After making a few phone calls,
we were invited to go


150
0:6:31,16 --> 0:6:33,78
and crash the training session
for local team


151
0:6:33,78 --> 0:6:36,63
the Las Vegas Sin.


152
0:6:36,63 --> 0:6:38,855
ANNOUNCER: Here she is,
first down and more.


153
0:6:38,855 --> 0:6:40,605
Inside the 10, 5, Las Vegas has


154
0:6:40,605 --> 0:6:42,55
scored their first touchdown.


155
0:6:42,55 --> 0:6:48,2



156
0:6:48,2 --> 0:6:51,47
ANTHONY: Over the years, since
I've coached women's football,


157
0:6:51,47 --> 0:6:54,2
I've learned every woman's
different.


158
0:6:54,2 --> 0:6:56,43
We're probably one of few
coaches who really just


159
0:6:56,43 --> 0:6:58,38
understands life.


160
0:6:58,38 --> 0:7:2,57
And we let the women
live their lives.


161
0:7:2,57 --> 0:7:5,435
HEATHER: I really trust what
Coach Hac does with


162
0:7:5,435 --> 0:7:6,61
everything with me.


163
0:7:6,61 --> 0:7:9,67
So if I'm a quarterback slot
receiver, I trust what he does


164
0:7:9,67 --> 0:7:11,8
and I know that it's for
the best for the team.


165
0:7:11,8 --> 0:7:13,91
ANTHONY: As a coach, I have to
look beyond the whole lingerie


166
0:7:13,91 --> 0:7:17,44
aspect of it, and just
look at the athlete.


167
0:7:17,44 --> 0:7:18,2
ANNOUNCER: Look at her go!


168
0:7:18,2 --> 0:7:18,61
She's everything!


169
0:7:18,61 --> 0:7:19,685
She has it all!


170
0:7:19,685 --> 0:7:21,37
She's got the moves, she's
got the speed,


171
0:7:21,37 --> 0:7:22,11
she's got the power!


172
0:7:22,11 --> 0:7:24,61
CHARLET: Is it not ever
a bit impractical?


173
0:7:24,61 --> 0:7:26,18
MADDIE: I've never had anything
been pulled out or


174
0:7:26,18 --> 0:7:27,83
showed out, but I've seen it.


175
0:7:27,83 --> 0:7:29,89
CHARLET: Are your
fans mainly men?


176
0:7:29,89 --> 0:7:30,51
MADDIE: Yes.


177
0:7:30,51 --> 0:7:33,35
They go there for bachelor
parties, big groups of guys.


178
0:7:33,35 --> 0:7:36,49
CHARLET: So it's not as violent,
maybe, as the male--


179
0:7:36,49 --> 0:7:36,94
MADDIE: No, it is.


180
0:7:36,94 --> 0:7:37,11
CHARLET: --equivalent?


181
0:7:37,11 --> 0:7:37,9
It is?


182
0:7:37,9 --> 0:7:38,2
MADDIE: Yeah.


183
0:7:38,2 --> 0:7:40,94
We hit like men, but we
have less padding on.


184
0:7:40,94 --> 0:7:42,175
So it actually hurts
a lot worse.


185
0:7:42,175 --> 0:7:45,17
It sucks.


186
0:7:45,17 --> 0:7:47,677
TAMICA: And I just love the fact
that it allows women to


187
0:7:47,677 --> 0:7:51,9
still compete at a high
level of sports, and


188
0:7:51,9 --> 0:7:53,13
it's extremely sexy.


189
0:7:53,13 --> 0:7:55,609
Because it's still a new league,
there's still a lot of


190
0:7:55,609 --> 0:7:57,581
people who have their doubts.


191
0:7:57,581 --> 0:7:59,77
They'll consider it a powderpuff
league, but it


192
0:7:59,77 --> 0:8:0,62
really isn't.


193
0:8:0,62 --> 0:8:3,44
The ladies out here are really
hard, rough, and just


194
0:8:3,44 --> 0:8:7,95
beautiful and competitive
and it's amazing.


195
0:8:7,95 --> 0:8:9,873
CHARLET: It's very hot.


196
0:8:9,873 --> 0:8:10,81
DION: Yes.


197
0:8:10,81 --> 0:8:12,38
It's Las Vegas.


198
0:8:12,38 --> 0:8:14,804
CHARLET: These are a bit
sexy, aren't they?


199
0:8:14,804 --> 0:8:17,78
DION: Put the right foot up,
right foot up, right foot up.


200
0:8:17,78 --> 0:8:18,772
There you go, looking at her.


201
0:8:18,772 --> 0:8:19,268
And getting ready to run.


202
0:8:19,268 --> 0:8:19,764
Ready?


203
0:8:19,764 --> 0:8:20,77
There you go.


204
0:8:20,77 --> 0:8:22,58
Three steps-- one, two, three.


205
0:8:22,58 --> 0:8:23,77
Go out.


206
0:8:23,77 --> 0:8:24,71
Now go deep.


207
0:8:24,71 --> 0:8:24,57
Go deep.


208
0:8:24,57 --> 0:8:25,13
Keep running, keep running.


209
0:8:25,13 --> 0:8:25,962
Keep running.


210
0:8:25,962 --> 0:8:27,35
Go get it.


211
0:8:27,35 --> 0:8:29,22
Ahh!


212
0:8:29,22 --> 0:8:30,54
What is that?


213
0:8:30,54 --> 0:8:32,9
CHARLET: Didn't you just
think oh, this sounds


214
0:8:32,9 --> 0:8:33,9
like a bit of a gimmick?


215
0:8:33,9 --> 0:8:36,2
These girls are just going to
be flapping around, they're


216
0:8:36,2 --> 0:8:36,87
not into that--


217
0:8:36,87 --> 0:8:38,47
DION: The first group of
girls was a gimmick.


218
0:8:38,47 --> 0:8:39,89
They were really models.


219
0:8:39,89 --> 0:8:42,7
So now you have real athletes
that have ran track, who have


220
0:8:42,7 --> 0:8:47,13
done softball, volleyball, and
now they're learning the game


221
0:8:47,13 --> 0:8:47,47
of football.


222
0:8:47,47 --> 0:8:49,45
CHARLET: How important is the
lingerie to this whole thing?


223
0:8:49,45 --> 0:8:51,41
DION: You bring football
and women together?


224
0:8:51,41 --> 0:8:52,75
Sexy women and football
together?


225
0:8:52,75 --> 0:8:54,14
That's every man's
fantasy, right?


226
0:8:54,14 --> 0:9:0,523



227
0:9:0,523 --> 0:9:1,996
ANNOUNCER: Touchdown, Vegas.


228
0:9:1,996 --> 0:9:3,469
CHARLET: I caught it!


229
0:9:3,469 --> 0:9:3,96
Didn't you see?


230
0:9:3,96 --> 0:9:6,906
ANNOUNCER: One more time,
Vegas just puts on the


231
0:9:6,906 --> 0:9:9,39
exclamation point.


232
0:9:9,39 --> 0:9:10,421
CHARLET: Team on me!


233
0:9:10,421 --> 0:9:11,403
MALE SPEAKER: Team on three.


234
0:9:11,403 --> 0:9:12,385
CHARLET: Team on three!


235
0:9:12,385 --> 0:9:13,858
FEMALE SPEAKER: Say
one, two, three.


236
0:9:13,858 --> 0:9:14,84
CHARLET: One, two, three--


237
0:9:14,84 --> 0:9:16,9
FOOTBALL PLAYERS: Team!


238
0:9:16,9 --> 0:9:22,16



239
0:9:22,16 --> 0:9:23,71
CHARLET: So this is Strings.


240
0:9:23,71 --> 0:9:25,0
Ever heard of it?


241
0:9:25,0 --> 0:9:25,92
Me neither.


242
0:9:25,92 --> 0:9:28,855
But it's actually the number one
manufacturer and supplier


243
0:9:28,855 --> 0:9:32,24
of g-strings to the
Nevada state area.


244
0:9:32,24 --> 0:9:35,31
Apparently, times were tough in
the g-string business, and


245
0:9:35,31 --> 0:9:38,26
ownership had changed hands
several times over the years.


246
0:9:38,26 --> 0:9:40,19
Do you live here?


247
0:9:40,19 --> 0:9:41,575
LEO: Yes, I've been living
in Vegas for


248
0:9:41,575 --> 0:9:42,66
about four years now.


249
0:9:42,66 --> 0:9:45,24
I had to reinvent myself, so
I came out to Vegas, and I


250
0:9:45,24 --> 0:9:46,68
reinvented myself.


251
0:9:46,68 --> 0:9:48,22
CHARLET: How's it doing,
the reinvention?


252
0:9:48,22 --> 0:9:48,79
LEO: It's working well.


253
0:9:48,79 --> 0:9:49,75
I'm still here!


254
0:9:49,75 --> 0:9:52,1
CHARLET: Do you think it's a
better quality of life here?


255
0:9:52,1 --> 0:9:53,44
LEO: It all depends what
you're looking for.


256
0:9:53,44 --> 0:9:55,85
I'm single, footloose,
fancy-free, with no luggage.


257
0:9:55,85 --> 0:9:57,41
There's entertainment here.


258
0:9:57,41 --> 0:9:59,19
Of course, there's family
entertainment, but I'm not


259
0:9:59,19 --> 0:10:0,22
here for family entertainment.


260
0:10:0,22 --> 0:10:3,88
I like a 24-hour city where I
could choose the level of


261
0:10:3,88 --> 0:10:6,6
entertainment that I'm looking
for and [INAUDIBLE] the danger


262
0:10:6,6 --> 0:10:9,234
I'd like to get involved with,
if you know what I mean.


263
0:10:9,234 --> 0:10:11,142
FEMALE SPEAKER: And you can
play with Little Bo Peep!


264
0:10:11,142 --> 0:10:12,2
LEO: Oh, my, yes!


265
0:10:12,2 --> 0:10:12,35
Let's see.


266
0:10:12,35 --> 0:10:13,69
Come on out here.


267
0:10:13,69 --> 0:10:14,56
Let's see.


268
0:10:14,56 --> 0:10:15,56
FEMALE SPEAKER: How
does it feel?


269
0:10:15,56 --> 0:10:16,21
LEO: That's beautiful.


270
0:10:16,21 --> 0:10:18,8
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh,
it's super cute.


271
0:10:18,8 --> 0:10:18,77
LEO: Oh, that's outstanding.


272
0:10:18,77 --> 0:10:20,19
FEMALE SPEAKER: I just
need my little sheep.


273
0:10:20,19 --> 0:10:21,19
MIKE: We invented
the sexy bikini.


274
0:10:21,19 --> 0:10:23,25
We invented the scrunch.


275
0:10:23,25 --> 0:10:26,53
We changed the way everyone
wears their stuff, and copies


276
0:10:26,53 --> 0:10:27,63
us from Vegas.


277
0:10:27,63 --> 0:10:30,42
The trend in Vegas is less and
less and less and smaller,


278
0:10:30,42 --> 0:10:32,11
because they're all trying to
get the money, which is hard


279
0:10:32,11 --> 0:10:34,31
to get right now because
of the economy.


280
0:10:34,31 --> 0:10:36,42
If they make a lot of money one
night wearing something,


281
0:10:36,42 --> 0:10:38,6
that will become their lucky
set of clothes, and they'll


282
0:10:38,6 --> 0:10:41,22
just wear that every day because
they think it's lucky.


283
0:10:41,22 --> 0:10:42,9
I don't think the guys
in the club really


284
0:10:42,9 --> 0:10:44,61
care what you're wearing.


285
0:10:44,61 --> 0:10:46,17
This is a tiny bikini.


286
0:10:46,17 --> 0:10:49,13
CHARLET: Oh my god, even that
makes me feel busty.


287
0:10:49,13 --> 0:10:51,26
MIKE: That's the new smallest
version we've made.


288
0:10:51,26 --> 0:10:53,46
This was the tiny before.


289
0:10:53,46 --> 0:10:55,9
But this is the new tiny.


290
0:10:55,9 --> 0:10:57,54
CHARLET: Are there are things
that when you started working


291
0:10:57,54 --> 0:10:59,4
here, that you were
selling, that now


292
0:10:59,4 --> 0:11:1,2
people just won't touch?


293
0:11:1,2 --> 0:11:3,325
MIKE: Anything that covers up
too much doesn't sell anymore.


294
0:11:3,325 --> 0:11:13,336



295
0:11:13,336 --> 0:11:14,87
CHARLET: You're the best
g-string maker in America?


296
0:11:14,87 --> 0:11:17,9



297
0:11:17,9 --> 0:11:20,98
CHARLET: 20 g-strings an hour?


298
0:11:20,98 --> 0:11:22,23
CHARLET: So what's her secret?


299
0:11:22,23 --> 0:11:34,94



300
0:11:34,94 --> 0:11:36,31
CHARLET: Congratulations!


301
0:11:36,31 --> 0:11:39,4
That is a g-string.


302
0:11:39,4 --> 0:11:41,2
As fascinating as that
was, it was nearly


303
0:11:41,2 --> 0:11:42,375
time for us to leave.


304
0:11:42,375 --> 0:11:44,71
But before we did, Mike
said I could choose an


305
0:11:44,71 --> 0:11:46,18
outfit from the shop.


306
0:11:46,18 --> 0:11:48,47
MIKE: This one would
look good on you.


307
0:11:48,47 --> 0:11:49,72
CHARLET: OK.


308
0:11:49,72 --> 0:11:51,48
MIKE: You can pick any color
underwear you want, but you


309
0:11:51,48 --> 0:11:53,13
might want to just
go with hot pink.


310
0:11:53,13 --> 0:11:55,3
It all depends on your
bum, too, right?


311
0:11:55,3 --> 0:12:0,27



312
0:12:0,27 --> 0:12:2,0
That dress was made for you.


313
0:12:2,0 --> 0:12:4,73
That's a perfect Vegas night
out dress for you.


314
0:12:4,73 --> 0:12:10,131



315
0:12:10,131 --> 0:12:12,14
CHARLET: After a whole afternoon
learning about the


316
0:12:12,14 --> 0:12:15,52
finer points of g-string
construction, we made our way


317
0:12:15,52 --> 0:12:18,51
back across town for what we
thought was the opening show


318
0:12:18,51 --> 0:12:21,55
of the Las Vegas International
Lingerie event.


319
0:12:21,55 --> 0:12:24,495
After a disappointing trade
show, we were more than ready


320
0:12:24,495 --> 0:12:25,98
to have our minds blown.


321
0:12:25,98 --> 0:12:28,86



322
0:12:28,86 --> 0:12:30,54
ANNOUNCER: Two, two, one,
two, check, two,


323
0:12:30,54 --> 0:12:33,66
two, one, two, two.


324
0:12:33,66 --> 0:12:36,185
CHARLET: So these are the
dancers who are rehearsing for


325
0:12:36,185 --> 0:12:37,37
the show tonight.


326
0:12:37,37 --> 0:12:39,8
They're being choreographed.


327
0:12:39,8 --> 0:12:42,7
And they're all in track suits,
but when we see them


328
0:12:42,7 --> 0:12:43,39
later, they're all going
to be half-naked.


329
0:12:43,39 --> 0:12:46,99
I thought it was going to be
more of a catwalk thing, but


330
0:12:46,99 --> 0:12:50,411
it seems that it's more of
a dance performance.


331
0:12:50,411 --> 0:12:54,34
FEMALE SPEAKER: Look, look,
two head rolls this time.


332
0:12:54,34 --> 0:12:55,7
TAMICA: My name is Jessie, hi.


333
0:12:55,7 --> 0:12:56,79
I'm a model.


334
0:12:56,79 --> 0:12:58,44
This is my first number.


335
0:12:58,44 --> 0:13:3,81
On the inside of this one, you
can hold all of your money!


336
0:13:3,81 --> 0:13:7,66
This one is kind of like an
old time gangster, kind of


337
0:13:7,66 --> 0:13:9,1
Halloween costume.


338
0:13:9,1 --> 0:13:10,9
CHARLET: Where do the
boobs go, Jessie?


339
0:13:10,9 --> 0:13:12,84
JESSIE: I'm not quite
sure where the boobs


340
0:13:12,84 --> 0:13:14,9
are supposed to go.


341
0:13:14,9 --> 0:13:17,24



342
0:13:17,24 --> 0:13:18,72
FEMALE SPEAKER: Not everybody
can do it.


343
0:13:18,72 --> 0:13:21,68
And that sounds kind of mean
to say, but showgirls are


344
0:13:21,68 --> 0:13:24,15
showgirls because they actually
are trained dancers,


345
0:13:24,15 --> 0:13:27,72
and they are beautiful women,
and they are talented.


346
0:13:27,72 --> 0:13:29,56
You're not going to go be an
astronaut unless you're


347
0:13:29,56 --> 0:13:30,22
trained to do it.


348
0:13:30,22 --> 0:13:32,7
You won't come be a
showgirl either


349
0:13:32,7 --> 0:13:34,48
CHARLET: Is there anything
you won't wear?


350
0:13:34,48 --> 0:13:35,755
FEMALE SPEAKER: I mean, there's
nothing I won't wear,


351
0:13:35,755 --> 0:13:39,45
because ultimately somebody's
paying me to wear what they've


352
0:13:39,45 --> 0:13:41,36
asked me to, and I've
agreed to it.


353
0:13:41,36 --> 0:13:43,94
As soon as this is over, we'll
get our check, and we'll race


354
0:13:43,94 --> 0:13:48,195
over to the Luxor and do our
fittings for new costumes that


355
0:13:48,195 --> 0:13:51,8
are going into the
show tonight.


356
0:13:51,8 --> 0:13:53,3
I don't even know
what day it is.


357
0:13:53,3 --> 0:13:54,15
I'm being called.


358
0:13:54,15 --> 0:13:55,321
Sorry, got to go.


359
0:13:55,321 --> 0:13:56,571
CHARLET: Thank you.


360
0:13:56,571 --> 0:13:59,56



361
0:13:59,56 --> 0:14:1,805
The doors have opened
to the punters.


362
0:14:1,805 --> 0:14:3,95
They're flooding in.


363
0:14:3,95 --> 0:14:7,0
It's funny, this is not like--
it doesn't have the same vibe


364
0:14:7,0 --> 0:14:9,34
as a fashion week somewhere
else in the world.


365
0:14:9,34 --> 0:14:11,28
These girls are just fucking
hard workers.


366
0:14:11,28 --> 0:14:13,35
This is just another
job for them.


367
0:14:13,35 --> 0:14:15,55
They're going to go off
and do their next


368
0:14:15,55 --> 0:14:17,11
show somewhere else.


369
0:14:17,11 --> 0:14:20,89
They're all a bit kind of dead
behind the eyes, almost.


370
0:14:20,89 --> 0:14:22,1
But this is Vegas.


371
0:14:22,1 --> 0:14:25,42
I suppose this is
what you get.


372
0:14:25,42 --> 0:14:28,98
ANNOUNCER: Thank you so much for
all the buyers coming out.


373
0:14:28,98 --> 0:14:31,105
You guys look good out there.


374
0:14:31,105 --> 0:14:34,92
I want to thank a lot of support
people that help us


375
0:14:34,92 --> 0:14:36,31
put on this show.


376
0:14:36,31 --> 0:14:41,14
And it's time to party!


377
0:14:41,14 --> 0:14:57,8
[DANCE MUSIC]


378
0:14:57,8 --> 0:14:59,32
CHARLET: And that was it.


379
0:14:59,32 --> 0:15:2,385
This hour-long parade had been
the International Lingerie


380
0:15:2,385 --> 0:15:5,56
Show, what we've come
all this way for.


381
0:15:5,56 --> 0:15:9,736
But at least we'd made
some new friends.


382
0:15:9,736 --> 0:15:12,73
DENNIS: Oh-oh, my friend
[INAUDIBLE] here.


383
0:15:12,73 --> 0:15:14,5
CHARLET: This is an
international lingerie show.


384
0:15:14,5 --> 0:15:16,71
Do you have a favorite thing?


385
0:15:16,71 --> 0:15:17,575
DENNIS: I'll be honest.


386
0:15:17,575 --> 0:15:21,56
Personally, I just like to see
a lot of skin, and I like the


387
0:15:21,56 --> 0:15:23,12
kind of slutty look.


388
0:15:23,12 --> 0:15:27,11
And I also like the very
romantic, beautiful costumes.


389
0:15:27,11 --> 0:15:31,11
And I just thoroughly
enjoy it here.


390
0:15:31,11 --> 0:15:33,76
FEMALE SPEAKER: I liked the
old days when they had fur


391
0:15:33,76 --> 0:15:37,27
coats and jewelry, and
it was classy.


392
0:15:37,27 --> 0:15:38,54
I like that a lot.


393
0:15:38,54 --> 0:15:40,9
It was elegant, it was nice.


394
0:15:40,9 --> 0:15:43,16
It was evening gowns to go
to shows, you dressed up.


395
0:15:43,16 --> 0:15:46,28
And now you can go, and they
wear cut-off shorts.


396
0:15:46,28 --> 0:15:48,998
These two ladies were sitting at
the bar and they're talking


397
0:15:48,998 --> 0:15:50,539
about shopping, and they're
talking about sex and


398
0:15:50,539 --> 0:15:50,998
everything.


399
0:15:50,998 --> 0:15:53,599
And the one lady said, did you
know a guy can tell the size


400
0:15:53,599 --> 0:15:55,61
of your vagina by the
size of your mouth?


401
0:15:55,61 --> 0:15:58,63
And her friend goes,
oooh, really?


402
0:15:58,63 --> 0:16:5,67



403
0:16:5,67 --> 0:16:6,92
FEMALE SPEAKERS:
Viva Las Vegas!


404
0:16:6,92 --> 0:16:18,516



405
0:16:18,516 --> 0:16:22,15
CHARLET: We've just been kicked
out from backstage


406
0:16:22,15 --> 0:16:24,21
because some of the models are
feeling uncomfortable.


407
0:16:24,21 --> 0:16:28,51
So now we're stuck out here in
this really fun corridor.


408
0:16:28,51 --> 0:16:32,6



409
0:16:32,6 --> 0:16:34,75
The whole thing had descended
into a gaggle of middle-aged


410
0:16:34,75 --> 0:16:37,3
women grasping frantically
for free dildos and lube.


411
0:16:37,3 --> 0:16:40,635



412
0:16:40,635 --> 0:16:43,77
Call me old-fashioned, but I
prefer just a little more left


413
0:16:43,77 --> 0:16:45,2
to the imagination.


414
0:16:45,2 --> 0:16:49,87



415
0:16:49,87 --> 0:16:54,47
After only three days in the
city, I felt used and dirty.


416
0:16:54,47 --> 0:16:57,35
My dreams of finding that
old Vegas magic had


417
0:16:57,35 --> 0:16:59,9
fallen wildly short.


418
0:16:59,9 --> 0:17:2,96
We drove back to Death Valley
to our friend Mark's house,


419
0:17:2,96 --> 0:17:5,589
where he and his buddy David led
us through the nighttime


420
0:17:5,589 --> 0:17:8,804
desert to take a cleansing dip
in a natural hot spring


421
0:17:8,804 --> 0:17:11,4
powered by volcanic energy.


422
0:17:11,4 --> 0:17:14,359
I jumped at the chance to wash
away the feeling of having


423
0:17:14,359 --> 0:17:18,484
been at a seedy funeral for
the death of the showgirl


424
0:17:18,484 --> 0:17:21,753
MARK: There's bubbles, that's
gases that are depressurizing


425
0:17:21,753 --> 0:17:23,19
as they come to the surface.


426
0:17:23,19 --> 0:17:26,64
And they set off a frequency
in the water.


427
0:17:26,64 --> 0:17:27,89
CHARLET: Get in.


428
0:17:27,89 --> 0:17:31,33



429
0:17:31,33 --> 0:17:33,91
MARK: It's like DH
Lawrence said.


430
0:17:33,91 --> 0:17:36,84
"tHE dead alive man has become
an enigma of our time, which


431
0:17:36,84 --> 0:17:38,91
it never was before.


432
0:17:38,91 --> 0:17:42,19
He has gone down the slope of
mechanized death, depending on


433
0:17:42,19 --> 0:17:46,945
artificial stimulations that
the city offers until he


434
0:17:46,945 --> 0:17:50,27
himself becomes artificial."
That certainly happened to me.


435
0:17:50,27 --> 0:17:51,87
That seemed to happen
to other people.


436
0:17:51,87 --> 0:17:54,36
They're so dependent on
artificial stimulations to


437
0:17:54,36 --> 0:17:56,95
keep themselves propped up,
they can't bear it.


438
0:17:56,95 --> 0:17:59,2
They just fall apart.


439
0:17:59,2 --> 0:18:3,3
The men are missing out on the
best that life has to offer.


440
0:18:3,3 --> 0:18:4,67
The best that love
has to offer.


441
0:18:4,67 --> 0:18:8,46



442
0:18:8,46 --> 0:18:11,36
It wasn't until I took some LSD
that I realized just how


443
0:18:11,36 --> 0:18:13,18
far away from reality
I really was.


444
0:18:13,18 --> 0:20:13,18
