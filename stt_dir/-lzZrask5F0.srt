0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:7,54



2
0:0:7,54 --> 0:0:8,67
SASHA GREY: It's not going
to matter what


3
0:0:8,67 --> 0:0:11,46
magazine says about me.


4
0:0:11,46 --> 0:0:14,28
It's not going to matter what
TV show says I'm a bad


5
0:0:14,28 --> 0:0:16,3
influence on youth.


6
0:0:16,3 --> 0:0:19,17
It's really about continuing to
just follow my dreams and


7
0:0:19,17 --> 0:0:21,695
passions, be myself,
and share my voice.


8
0:0:21,695 --> 0:0:34,91



9
0:0:34,91 --> 0:0:36,34
I was in college.


10
0:0:36,34 --> 0:0:38,61
And I was working six,
seven days a week.


11
0:0:38,61 --> 0:0:41,27
And if I was by myself, not
studying, I was probably


12
0:0:41,27 --> 0:0:42,28
watching porn.


13
0:0:42,28 --> 0:0:45,21
And it was like, yeah, I like
it, and yeah, I can get off.


14
0:0:45,21 --> 0:0:48,84
But I felt like there was a
creative component missing.


15
0:0:48,84 --> 0:0:53,88
And I also had different
ideas of what sex was.


16
0:0:53,88 --> 0:0:56,9
And I felt sick--


17
0:0:56,9 --> 0:0:56,79
you know what I mean?


18
0:0:56,79 --> 0:0:58,14
I felt sick to my stomach.


19
0:0:58,14 --> 0:0:59,52
I'm like, I'm not supposed
to think this way.


20
0:0:59,52 --> 0:1:2,66
I was the oldest out
of all my friends


21
0:1:2,66 --> 0:1:5,239
to lose their virginity.


22
0:1:5,239 --> 0:1:8,5
I was 16 and a half.


23
0:1:8,5 --> 0:1:8,7
I know that's funny.


24
0:1:8,7 --> 0:1:12,35
But I was a senior
in high school.


25
0:1:12,35 --> 0:1:16,7
I kind of had this very
male-driven mentality, like, I


26
0:1:16,7 --> 0:1:19,14
don't want to love a boy
to have sex with him.


27
0:1:19,14 --> 0:1:22,32
And at the same time, I was
so conflicted internally.


28
0:1:22,32 --> 0:1:26,8
Like, I didn't know how do I go
about doing that and just


29
0:1:26,8 --> 0:1:31,6
feel safe and feel like
I'm in control?


30
0:1:31,6 --> 0:1:35,8
So for me, getting in the
business was a way to continue


31
0:1:35,8 --> 0:1:37,3
exploring those things safely.


32
0:1:37,3 --> 0:1:41,145
But then also, I kind of just
had this awakening.


33
0:1:41,145 --> 0:1:44,12
And I started to really
understand the sexual


34
0:1:44,12 --> 0:1:47,205
revolution that I
so idealized.


35
0:1:47,205 --> 0:1:51,6



36
0:1:51,6 --> 0:1:53,84
It doesn't matter what you
say to your parents.


37
0:1:53,84 --> 0:1:55,9
No parent wants their
kid doing porn.


38
0:1:55,9 --> 0:1:58,41
I didn't tell them until I had
been here for two weeks.


39
0:1:58,41 --> 0:2:1,16
Because, like, I want to get
down there, and get started,


40
0:2:1,16 --> 0:2:2,7
and then tell them.


41
0:2:2,7 --> 0:2:7,9
And my mom is Catholic.


42
0:2:7,9 --> 0:2:10,43
So that's where the
guilt comes from.


43
0:2:10,43 --> 0:2:13,76
And my dad was just like,
follow your goals


44
0:2:13,76 --> 0:2:15,19
and don't fuck up.


45
0:2:15,19 --> 0:2:20,18
And it was all in the subtext,
like, I'm going to be really


46
0:2:20,18 --> 0:2:23,24
fucking disappointed if you
fuck up, and do something


47
0:2:23,24 --> 0:2:24,49
stupid, and make the
wrong mistakes.


48
0:2:24,49 --> 0:2:28,44



49
0:2:28,44 --> 0:2:35,33
I showed a series of photos to
my literary agent in 2007.


50
0:2:35,33 --> 0:2:37,84
And I had been taking
photographs onset to just


51
0:2:37,84 --> 0:2:40,3
document my environment
each day.


52
0:2:40,3 --> 0:2:42,23
And they were just, like,
for me to look back


53
0:2:42,23 --> 0:2:43,49
on when I was older.


54
0:2:43,49 --> 0:2:45,67
For me, it was about
self-examination in these


55
0:2:45,67 --> 0:2:47,6
self-portraits.


56
0:2:47,6 --> 0:2:51,56
Some of them look more like
a documentary-style photo.


57
0:2:51,56 --> 0:2:54,33
But they were completely
conceived of.


58
0:2:54,33 --> 0:2:56,66
And it's funny, because you
could say, no, that's totally


59
0:2:56,66 --> 0:2:57,22
candid, right?


60
0:2:57,22 --> 0:2:58,45
No, it's not.


61
0:2:58,45 --> 0:3:1,92
Or this totally looks like
something post-sex.


62
0:3:1,92 --> 0:3:3,71
No, it's not.


63
0:3:3,71 --> 0:3:6,66
I think what, for me, is kind of
important is that it leaves


64
0:3:6,66 --> 0:3:8,17
people guessing.


65
0:3:8,17 --> 0:3:10,51
I think it shows misconceptions
about the adult


66
0:3:10,51 --> 0:3:13,23
industry that don't apply
to everybody.


67
0:3:13,23 --> 0:3:26,92



68
0:3:26,92 --> 0:3:32,62
Right now I'm really focusing on
proving myself as an actor.


69
0:3:32,62 --> 0:3:39,15
So while going out and looking
for roles, the thing that


70
0:3:39,15 --> 0:3:44,67
keeps me really going, and
driven, and motivated is when


71
0:3:44,67 --> 0:3:45,45
I'm not working.


72
0:3:45,45 --> 0:3:46,85
Because that's when you
want it the most.


73
0:3:46,85 --> 0:3:48,22
And that's when you're hungry.


74
0:3:48,22 --> 0:3:51,92
And that's when you want to
stand up and fucking scream


75
0:3:51,92 --> 0:3:54,13
and say, I can do this.


76
0:3:54,13 --> 0:3:58,18
So my friend and our writing
partner, Anthony, is coming


77
0:3:58,18 --> 0:3:59,16
into town today.


78
0:3:59,16 --> 0:4:1,21
And we're going to have a
three-day writing workshop.


79
0:4:1,21 --> 0:4:5,35
So it's really about creating
opportunities for myself.


80
0:4:5,35 --> 0:4:8,77



81
0:4:8,77 --> 0:4:9,77
2006.


82
0:4:9,77 --> 0:4:13,52
Our band, aTelecine, started
making music, and we ended up


83
0:4:13,52 --> 0:4:16,29
putting it on MySpace
without my name.


84
0:4:16,29 --> 0:4:17,32
People liked it.


85
0:4:17,32 --> 0:4:18,47
So we were, like, well, OK.


86
0:4:18,47 --> 0:4:21,16
What happens when we put Sasha
Grey as part of it?


87
0:4:21,16 --> 0:4:23,95
And of course, that helped
us get our deal


88
0:4:23,95 --> 0:4:26,71
with Pendu and Dais.


89
0:4:26,71 --> 0:4:29,73
I can't sing, but I sing.


90
0:4:29,73 --> 0:4:33,46
I can't play a cool
Sabbath song on


91
0:4:33,46 --> 0:4:34,96
guitar, but I play guitar.


92
0:4:34,96 --> 0:4:35,8
You know what I mean?


93
0:4:35,8 --> 0:4:38,58
It's just pure fun.


94
0:4:38,58 --> 0:4:40,475
And it became really
cathartic.


95
0:4:40,475 --> 0:4:48,75



96
0:4:48,75 --> 0:4:54,56
I love Throbbing Gristle,
Current 93, Joy Division,


97
0:4:54,56 --> 0:4:59,95
Parliament-Funkadelic, NWA.


98
0:4:59,95 --> 0:5:3,5
This is what I played this
morning before you guys came.


99
0:5:3,5 --> 0:5:6,29



100
0:5:6,29 --> 0:5:6,61
Oh, yeah.


101
0:5:6,61 --> 0:5:7,75
This one is really good.


102
0:5:7,75 --> 0:5:10,21
It's a live Crosby, Stills,
Nash & Young.


103
0:5:10,21 --> 0:5:12,48
I'm pretty sure somebody did
cocaine off of the back of


104
0:5:12,48 --> 0:5:17,23
this, because there are
literally razor marks on the


105
0:5:17,23 --> 0:5:18,48
back of this.


106
0:5:18,48 --> 0:5:25,197



107
0:5:25,197 --> 0:5:25,688
DAVID CHOE: Hey.


108
0:5:25,688 --> 0:5:27,161
How's it going?


109
0:5:27,161 --> 0:5:28,411
SASHA GREY: Good to see you.


110
0:5:28,411 --> 0:5:35,3



111
0:5:35,3 --> 0:5:38,5
(BRITISH ACCENT) Thank you for
watching Granada Television.


112
0:5:38,5 --> 0:5:39,62
Without further ado--


113
0:5:39,62 --> 0:5:40,51
oh, wait, sorry.


114
0:5:40,51 --> 0:5:42,72
This is Vice, right?


115
0:5:42,72 --> 0:5:44,69
I don't think this guy needs
an introduction.


116
0:5:44,69 --> 0:5:47,556



117
0:5:47,556 --> 0:5:48,48
This is Dave Choe.


118
0:5:48,48 --> 0:5:49,91
INTERVIEWER: How do you
guys know each other?


119
0:5:49,91 --> 0:5:50,66
DAVID CHOE: That actually
involves


120
0:5:50,66 --> 0:5:52,4
our friend over there.


121
0:5:52,4 --> 0:5:55,24
SASHA GREY: James wanted
to paint me,


122
0:5:55,24 --> 0:5:57,5
because he liked my work.


123
0:5:57,5 --> 0:5:57,54
DAVID CHOE: Your work?


124
0:5:57,54 --> 0:5:59,1
That's a very interesting--


125
0:5:59,1 --> 0:6:1,42
SASHA GREY: It's a very
diverse body of work.


126
0:6:1,42 --> 0:6:3,37
DAVID CHOE: I went out
with Sasha once


127
0:6:3,37 --> 0:6:5,7
to the Machete premiere.


128
0:6:5,7 --> 0:6:9,36
And so every single person
was like, hey!


129
0:6:9,36 --> 0:6:11,24
I love your work in Entourage.


130
0:6:11,24 --> 0:6:13,55
And I was like, wait.


131
0:6:13,55 --> 0:6:15,58
So what did they say before
you were in, like,


132
0:6:15,58 --> 0:6:16,65
movies and TV shows?


133
0:6:16,65 --> 0:6:20,595
And they're like, oh,
I love your work.


134
0:6:20,595 --> 0:6:21,8
SASHA GREY: People, they
want to say it.


135
0:6:21,8 --> 0:6:24,916
But they're so polite
about it.


136
0:6:24,916 --> 0:6:27,43
Because I look like I'll
kick someone's ass?


137
0:6:27,43 --> 0:6:29,9
DAVID CHOE: I have a radio
station upstairs.


138
0:6:29,9 --> 0:6:33,15
So we'll do, like,
a real interview.


139
0:6:33,15 --> 0:6:35,29
This is a radio show
that I have that's


140
0:6:35,29 --> 0:6:38,53
broadcast to nowhere.


141
0:6:38,53 --> 0:6:42,17
You'll probably hear this after
the world's exploded.


142
0:6:42,17 --> 0:6:44,57
So is it true, this
whole journey?


143
0:6:44,57 --> 0:6:45,66
You're very determined.


144
0:6:45,66 --> 0:6:47,94
You knew, at a very young
age, porn, this is


145
0:6:47,94 --> 0:6:49,12
what I want to do.


146
0:6:49,12 --> 0:6:50,69
And you said, I wasn't going
to do it forever.


147
0:6:50,69 --> 0:6:51,61
Then you got out.


148
0:6:51,61 --> 0:6:53,76
Now you're doing movies,
TV shows.


149
0:6:53,76 --> 0:6:56,61
The bottom line for
all of this is--


150
0:6:56,61 --> 0:6:57,61
tell me if this is true.


151
0:6:57,61 --> 0:7:1,62
You're working, doing all this
stuff to ultimately own a


152
0:7:1,62 --> 0:7:3,95
blow-dry salon in Las Vegas?


153
0:7:3,95 --> 0:7:5,27
Is that true?


154
0:7:5,27 --> 0:7:5,97
That's the golden--


155
0:7:5,97 --> 0:7:8,79
SASHA GREY: That was
my master plan.


156
0:7:8,79 --> 0:7:11,8
DAVID CHOE: That's the golden
pot at the end of the rainbow?


157
0:7:11,8 --> 0:7:13,89
SASHA GREY: Ah, yes.


158
0:7:13,89 --> 0:7:17,2
Because all I care
about is hair.


159
0:7:17,2 --> 0:7:18,49
DAVID CHOE: Probably one of
the best painters I know,


160
0:7:18,49 --> 0:7:19,52
James Jean.


161
0:7:19,52 --> 0:7:22,72
We were painting her naked
in Highland Park.


162
0:7:22,72 --> 0:7:26,35
And you were rocking a pretty
big bush back then.


163
0:7:26,35 --> 0:7:27,12
SASHA GREY: Still am.


164
0:7:27,12 --> 0:7:28,95
DAVID CHOE: You brought
that back, right?


165
0:7:28,95 --> 0:7:29,69
SASHA GREY: I don't know if I


166
0:7:29,69 --> 0:7:31,46
single-handedly brought it back.


167
0:7:31,46 --> 0:7:33,45
DAVID CHOE: I think a lot of
your appeal is that you look


168
0:7:33,45 --> 0:7:36,85
like such a nice girl that could
be, like, a model for


169
0:7:36,85 --> 0:7:37,835
Victoria's Secret
or something.


170
0:7:37,835 --> 0:7:41,0
And then you always imagine--


171
0:7:41,0 --> 0:7:43,43
SASHA GREY: Without the boobs?


172
0:7:43,43 --> 0:7:44,405
DAVID CHOE: You got
nice boobs.


173
0:7:44,405 --> 0:7:45,65
SASHA GREY: Oh, I
like my boobs.


174
0:7:45,65 --> 0:7:46,55
DAVID CHOE: I mean, you
don't look like


175
0:7:46,55 --> 0:7:47,93
most porn stars, basically.


176
0:7:47,93 --> 0:7:51,53
And you were doing super, like,
violent, crazy shit.


177
0:7:51,53 --> 0:7:55,1
SASHA GREY: See, violence is
the way you like to put it.


178
0:7:55,1 --> 0:7:55,38
DAVID CHOE: I don't know.


179
0:7:55,38 --> 0:7:57,7
How would you put that?


180
0:7:57,7 --> 0:7:58,26
SASHA GREY: No, I mean,
I don't think I


181
0:7:58,26 --> 0:7:59,71
feel the way you feel.


182
0:7:59,71 --> 0:8:0,22
And I think a lot of
people expect me--


183
0:8:0,22 --> 0:8:2,2
DAVID CHOE: Some of your movies
were, like, borderline


184
0:8:2,2 --> 0:8:6,28
snuff films, I think.


185
0:8:6,28 --> 0:8:11,44
This is the mask I wore in
Coachella for Die Antwoord's


186
0:8:11,44 --> 0:8:12,69
American debut.


187
0:8:12,69 --> 0:8:15,414



188
0:8:15,414 --> 0:8:18,7
[COMPUTER VOICE]


189
0:8:18,7 --> 0:8:22,7



190
0:8:22,7 --> 0:8:23,93
SASHA GREY: Ugh!


191
0:8:23,93 --> 0:8:25,265
My head is bigger than Dave's.


192
0:8:25,265 --> 0:8:29,486



193
0:8:29,486 --> 0:8:32,86
[COMPUTER VOICE]


194
0:8:32,86 --> 0:8:34,32
SASHA GREY: Shut up!


195
0:8:34,32 --> 0:8:37,94
DAVID CHOE: Now that you're not
doing porn, do you feel


196
0:8:37,94 --> 0:8:38,789
like there's something
missing?


197
0:8:38,789 --> 0:8:44,15
Like, you're like, damn, I used
to do fucking gangbangs


198
0:8:44,15 --> 0:8:45,38
and all this shit, and now--


199
0:8:45,38 --> 0:8:47,8
SASHA GREY: No, I think it's
more about a new way of


200
0:8:47,8 --> 0:8:49,8
discovering sex, because there's
no camera there.


201
0:8:49,8 --> 0:8:52,465
And I think you get so used to
having a camera watching you.


202
0:8:52,465 --> 0:8:55,49
And that's part of what
makes it exciting.


203
0:8:55,49 --> 0:9:1,27
So now it's about finding out
ways to make it that exciting.


204
0:9:1,27 --> 0:9:2,422
DAVID CHOE: What
are these ways?


205
0:9:2,422 --> 0:9:3,25
Explain.


206
0:9:3,25 --> 0:9:4,19
I want to know these ways.


207
0:9:4,19 --> 0:9:7,89
SASHA GREY: It's less about
exactly what you're doing, and


208
0:9:7,89 --> 0:9:13,99
more about the adrenaline
rush that you get.


209
0:9:13,99 --> 0:9:17,75
DAVID CHOE: Has it had a real
negative effect for what you


210
0:9:17,75 --> 0:9:18,23
want to do now?


211
0:9:18,23 --> 0:9:21,995
Because I mean, people compare,
like, oh, it's Sasha


212
0:9:21,995 --> 0:9:25,32
and Jenna Jameson are the two
that made it out of this.


213
0:9:25,32 --> 0:9:26,87
But yeah, the internet exists.


214
0:9:26,87 --> 0:9:28,38
And that will stay
with you forever.


215
0:9:28,38 --> 0:9:31,36
So you are trying out for,
like, mainstream


216
0:9:31,36 --> 0:9:32,96
movies and TV shows.


217
0:9:32,96 --> 0:9:36,63
Has that caught up to you to
the point where people say


218
0:9:36,63 --> 0:9:38,44
fucked up shit to you?


219
0:9:38,44 --> 0:9:38,77
SASHA GREY: No.


220
0:9:38,77 --> 0:9:41,13
Nobody will ever say anything
to your face.


221
0:9:41,13 --> 0:9:45,48
I think right now it's
about proving that


222
0:9:45,48 --> 0:9:47,11
I'm not just lucky.


223
0:9:47,11 --> 0:9:48,94
Because that's a way a lot
of people perceive


224
0:9:48,94 --> 0:9:49,99
it as, she's lucky.


225
0:9:49,99 --> 0:9:51,63
She got these chances.


226
0:9:51,63 --> 0:9:54,17
And any porn star could
have done it.


227
0:9:54,17 --> 0:9:58,21
So it's about proving
that I can go way,


228
0:9:58,21 --> 0:10:0,61
way, way beyond that.


229
0:10:0,61 --> 0:10:6,73
I mean, sex and money are the
two oldest professions.


230
0:10:6,73 --> 0:10:10,595
And they've always been
part of society.


231
0:10:10,595 --> 0:10:13,82
And they've always been part
of art in a huge away, even


232
0:10:13,82 --> 0:10:16,22
before video, or even
before films.


233
0:10:16,22 --> 0:10:19,63
DAVID CHOE: Anything else you
want to say about whores or


234
0:10:19,63 --> 0:10:21,5
married sex life?


235
0:10:21,5 --> 0:10:22,25
SASHA GREY: Your blanket
looks like it came


236
0:10:22,25 --> 0:10:24,882
out of a crack den.


237
0:10:24,882 --> 0:10:25,35
DAVID CHOE: Yeah.


238
0:10:25,35 --> 0:10:27,2
SASHA GREY: I don't know where
you got this thing.


239
0:10:27,2 --> 0:10:28,56
DAVID CHOE: This is my
spot, right here.


240
0:10:28,56 --> 0:10:31,1
SASHA GREY: You just want to
put the blanket over the--


241
0:10:31,1 --> 0:10:32,73
DAVID CHOE: That's
my glory hole.


242
0:10:32,73 --> 0:10:35,37
That's, like, you know.


243
0:10:35,37 --> 0:10:36,79
I don't like to be touched
during sex.


244
0:10:36,79 --> 0:10:39,21
I need to be under
a lot of fabric.


245
0:10:39,21 --> 0:10:42,5
That's my weird shit
that I'm into.


246
0:10:42,5 --> 0:10:44,786
SASHA GREY: You'd probably
like latex, then.


247
0:10:44,786 --> 0:10:45,23
DAVID CHOE: Yeah.


248
0:10:45,23 --> 0:10:46,546
I like latex.


249
0:10:46,546 --> 0:10:47,52
I like masks.


250
0:10:47,52 --> 0:10:49,67
I like hiding.


251
0:10:49,67 --> 0:10:52,596
SASHA GREY: That's fun.


252
0:10:52,596 --> 0:10:54,7
DAVID CHOE: Hit it as
hard as you can.
