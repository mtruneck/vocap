###1 ANNOUNCER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

###22 THOMAS MORTON: All right.
###23 Hi, it's Thomas.
###24 We're in Bishkek.
###25 I'm on a Kok Beru horse.
###28 That's basically polo, but you play with a dead goat.
###30 It is one of Kyrgystan's many fine traditions.
###34 One of the other traditions, a little less fun, is kidnapping
###38 women and making them your bride.
###40 We're going to go out of Bishkek up into the hills and
###43 see that happen.
###44 
###50 Kyrgyzstan is a tiny landlocked country next to
###52 China that spent most of the last century as part of the
###55 Soviet Union.
###56 Prior to that it was a wild, tribally ruled Conan land
###59 known for it's people's horsemanship, the mythic hero
###61 Manas, and for being the birthplace
###64 of the black plague.
###66 The Kyrgyz people celebrated the end of communism by
###68 adopting Islam as the state religion and getting really
###71 into their old national identity, some parts of which
###73 jibed nicely with the modern times, others of which didn't.
###77 BRIDE TO BE: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###80 THOMAS MORTON: Bride kidnapping is a traditional
###81 way of getting married that supposedly dates back to the
###83 horse days.
###85 How it works is a guy wants to marry a girl, he gets a few of
###87 his friends together, they grab the girl off the street,
###91 then they drive her back to his place, and his mom and
###93 aunts try to convince her that marrying their son is the
###95 right move--
###97 even if he's a total stranger.
###99 We'd heard a young east Kyrgyz villager named Kubanti was in
###102 the market for a bride.
###104 So we offered up our services as wedding photographers.
###107 KUBANTI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###109 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###122 UNCLE SULTAN: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###123 
###141 THOMAS MORTON: So far this is very similar
###142 to a Western wedding.
###143 You just have all the family together, favorite uncle kind
###146 of holding court at the table, a lot of food.
###149 It's hard to reconcile this hospitality with the kind of
###152 potential violence that's about to happen.
###156 BRIDE TO BE: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###158 THOMAS MORTON: Bride kidnapping is
###159 not a fringe custom.
###161 In rural areas, nearly half of all marriages result this way.
###164 BRIDE TO BE: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###166 THOMAS MORTON: And while it's technically illegal to kidnap
###167 your wife, not many Kyrgyz cops realize this, and even
###171 fewer care.
###172 BRIDE TO BE: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###173 FEMALE SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###175 
###178 RUSSELL KLEINBACH: There are two laws that
###179 make kidnapping illegal.
###181 And even in cases where the couple love each other.
###184 I know a number of cases where the
###185 woman said, I was kidnapped.
###187 I loved the man.
###187 I wanted to marry him, but I did not want to be kidnapped
###190 because it's very humiliating to be physically captured and
###193 forced into a car.
###194 BRIDE TO BE: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###196 RUSSELL KLEINBACH: The majority of the police and
###197 officials in the country don't even know it's illegal, or if
###201 they do, they believe it's an old tradition.

###261 pop a final squat to coordinate the snatch.
###263 GROOMSMAN: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###266 THOMAS MORTON: We're planning the kidnapping right now.
###269 How long have you guys been planning this?
###270 KUBANTI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###272 THOMAS MORTON: Who's the girl?
###273 Is it somebody you've been friends with?
###275 Somebody you know or is it somebody,
###276 like, your family knows?
###278 KUBANTI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###279 
###298 [SCREAMS AND MOANING]
###301 THOMAS MORTON: While bride kidnapping is largely a rural
###303 phenomenon, there's been a spike in
###304 cities in recent years.
###306 Generally attributed to the success of Ernest
###308 Abdyjaparov's 2007
###310 pro-kidnapping film, Boz Salkyn.

###388 
###398 RUSSELL KLEINBACH: Spousal abuse is higher
###400 in kidnapped marriages.
###401 Divorce rate is higher in kidnapped marriages.
###404 There's a higher percentage of women who go through that
###406 process who wind up rejected by families and going into
###409 prostitution.
###410 And suicide rates are higher among women who are kidnapped.
###414 ABDYSHOVA ZYINAGUL: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

###532 THOMAS MORTON: With the plan locked in place and the bridal
###534 yurt set up for the reception, all that was left for Kubanti
###537 and his pals was to go secure the bride.
###540 KUBANTI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###541 
###550 UNCLE SULTAN: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###554 THOMAS MORTON: Kubanti's uncle gave the boys one final good
###556 luck blessing, and they all piled into the get-a-wife van.
###560 Good luck, guys.
###561 GROOMSMAN: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###563 
###590 THOMAS MORTON: We're going to go to the, I guess the local
###592 watering hole, like, literally watering hole.
###594 That's where they've arranged for the friend of the bride to
###597 be to capture her.
###599 It's a little animal kingdom picking off your bride at the
###602 watering spot.
###603 [MUSIC PLAYING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###605 
###607 KUBANTI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###608 
###614 THOMAS MORTON: I feel OK about this right now just because
###616 this guy evidently knows her.
###619 In this case, it's just kind of a weirder form of popping
###621 the question, it feels like.
###622 At the same time, it's an extremely troubling
###626 institution.

###661 help them lure out the bride.
###664 They're negotiating with her right now.
###666 They're just planning how to do it.
###668 GROOMSMAN: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###669 
###698 THOMAS MORTON: They're just going to grab her?
###699 There's not like a blanket or anything?

###702 Pretty basic.

###896 family to get the girl to put on the bridal scarf and agree
###898 to the wedding, a process that can go on for
###901 hours or even days.
###903 FEMALE SPEAKER 2: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###905 
###934 THOMAS MORTON: OK.
###934 Thank you.
###936 This is a very confusing scene.
###939 FEMALE SPEAKER 2: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###941 THOMAS MORTON: I think the girl has
###942 accepted what happened.
###944 And I don't know if she was just putting up resistance
###946 because that's what you're supposed to do, or if she was
###948 genuinely freaked out.
###949 She's eating cookies now though and accepted a candy.
###952 Which I did too, which I don't know how I feel about that.

###1008 THOMAS MORTON: Is this what a wedding is normally like
###1010 around here?
###1011 UNCLE SULTAN: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1012 
###1040 THOMAS MORTON: Well, why do they do that?
###1041 If the families already know each other and are fine with
###1044 it, why the kidnapping?
###1046 Where does that come from?
###1047 UNCLE SULTAN: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1048 
###1068 RUSSELL KLEINBACH: In Kyrgyzstan, tradition stands
###1071 even above religion, I think, in terms of importance, and
###1073 religion above law.
###1075 The old tradition of Kyrgyzstan is the Manas Epis.
###1079 Manasa is the authority.
###1080 It's a kin to being in the Midwest according to Bible.
###1084 If there's a Kyrgyz tradition, it should be in Manas.
###1087 Manas is Kyrgyz, Kyrgyz is Manas.
###1089 And there's no stories of kidnapping
###1091 in that oral tradition.
###1094 It's a violation of Islam.
###1095 It's a violation of the law.
###1097 And it's pretty clear that prior to the Soviet period, it
###1099 was very uncommon and was not an acceptable traditional
###1103 practice, even though it happened sometimes.
###1107 [MUSIC PLAYING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1108 
###1113 THOMAS MORTON: God.
###1113 Today just gets rougher and rougher.
###1115 
###1119 So everything worked out?
###1120 KUBANTI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1121 THOMAS MORTON: OK.
###1122 It looked like she was fighting
###1123 pretty hard in the van.
###1124 I'm surprised you aren't, like, more beat up.
###1127 KUBANTI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1128 
###1136 THOMAS MORTON: Did she know who she was marrying once she
###1138 got in the car?
###1138 Did she know it was you?
###1140 It could have been any of those guys, right?
###1142 KUBANTI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1145 THOMAS MORTON: It was clear.
###1145 I mean, you're clearly--
###1146 Also, you're wearing the nicest clothes.
###1149 And you knew her, and you'd been dating her.
###1150 So it makes sense.
###1152 What happens next?
###1153 Do you have to go get her family?
###1154 KUBANTI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1156 
###1165 THOMAS MORTON: So the bride's been napped, sheep's been
###1167 slaughtered.
###1168 I guess we're really getting into the thick of the
###1170 wedding right now.
###1171 It kind of occurs to me that
###1172 compared to American groomsmen.
###1175 Kyrgyz groomsmen have a rough job.
###1177 All anybody ever complains about having to stage a
###1179 bachelor party or, you know, buy gifts, or wear a suit.
###1181 You don't have to kidnap a girl or cut open a sheep.
###1185 God knows what else is going to happen.
###1187 
###1189 So you're the grill master here?
###1191 What is that furry part?
###1195 Is that lungs?
###1196 GROOMSMAN: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1198 THOMAS MORTON: Stomach.
###1198 OK.
###1199 Could you have gotten in trouble for this?
###1201 I mean, if like a policeman or something had seen you, like,
###1203 could they have like stopped you?
###1205 GROOMSMAN: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1206 
###1220 THOMAS MORTON: And then they'd be fine with it.
###1221 OK.
###1222 What's the best part of the sheep?
###1223 
###1225 Those floppy ears--
###1227 Hey, you.
###1229 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1238 THOMAS MORTON: Once the girl has finally said yes, the men
###1239 from the groom's family go over to the bride's house and
###1242 tell her parents, sorry, we kidnapped your daughter.
###1245 Is that OK?
###1246 Unsurprisingly, this process can also take a while.
###1249 The men bring tons of gifts and food to
###1251 smooth things over.
###1253 So hopefully the bride's family will think of it less
###1255 as losing a daughter and more as gaining a sheep.
###1258 This is the bride's family-- or bride to be.
###1262 So evidently they aren't allowed in
###1263 yet to see the family.
###1265 So what's happening right now?
###1266 Why do you have to wait?
###1268 UNCLE SULTAN: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1270 
###1282 THOMAS MORTON: OK.
###1283 That was short.
###1285 [MUSIC PLAYING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1286 
###1299 THOMAS MORTON: I'm starting to get a little suspicious that
###1302 the bride's family may have known about
###1304 this ahead of time.
###1305 This is a pretty nice spread to put out on,
###1307 like, an hour's notice.

###1341 
###1346 THOMAS MORTON: How are you feeling about all this?
###1349 SOIROGUL: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1351 
###1361 THOMAS MORTON: The custom, the taking her up off the street,
###1363 is that how people got married when you were little?
###1365 SABIRA: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1366 
###1395 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1399 THOMAS MORTON: Everyone kept telling us how old and
###1401 hallowed the practice of bride kidnapping was.
###1404 But if it's not even in Manas, the country's national epic,
###1407 how old actually is it?
###1410 RUSSELL KLEINBACH: If we go back to the 19th century, when
###1412 you had tribal groups, they would go through villages, and
###1415 they would steal horses, and cattle, and women.
###1417 So there is a tradition of stealing.
###1418 But it would produce a real conflict between tribes and
###1422 was not an acceptable traditional practice.
###1424 And all the evidence shows that kidnapping was on an
###1426 increase from the latter period of the Soviet period.
###1429 And then it continued to increase at the end of the
###1432 Soviet period.
###1433 The Soviets said, first of all, we're going to stop
###1435 marriages of young girls before the age of 15 or so.
###1439 We're going to now send both boys and girls to high school
###1442 and college.
###1443 We collectivized the wealth so there's no money for bride
###1445 price and a dowry.
###1447 So now the young people are getting older
###1449 before they get married.
###1450 They go off to the university.
###1451 And they may come back and say, I found
###1453 someone I'd like to marry.
###1455 And the parents say no, we're arranging a marriage for you
###1457 in the village.
###1458 So she might go back to the university, or he, talk to the
###1461 boyfriend or girlfriend and says, is there any legitimate
###1464 way we can get married against our parents wishes.
###1467 You say, well, I will kidnap you, take you to my home, keep
###1469 you overnight.
###1470 Then they will consider you an unclean girl, and so they will
###1473 have to let you marry me.
###1474 And I think strangely enough, kidnapping is a response to
###1478 the Soviets bringing about more
###1480 equality for men and women.

###1708 Suits here are very shiny, though.
###1711 I think this might be the winner.
###1714 Minimally shiny, still shiny enough to go to a wedding in.
###1718 I think I found my suit.
###1719 We were really getting into the spirit of the festivities,
###1722 which was kind of unsettling considering we had just seen a

###1824 THOMAS MORTON: More vodka.
###1825 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1834 THOMAS MORTON: So right over my left shoulder is the sheet
###1836 from their wedding night, basically.
###1839 If she's a virgin, she's going to bleed on the sheet.
###1842 And then they take it out.
###1842 And that's proof to everybody.
###1844 And they hang it.
###1844 It's kind of weird.
###1845 You know, everybody put sort of a premium on virginity.
###1849 I never really got that shit.
###1851 But there it is, bride is a virgin.
###1854 Double good happiness for the bride and the groom.
###1858 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1863 SABIRA: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1864 
###1877 THOMAS MORTON: Traditionally, the day after a Kyrgyz
###1878 wedding, the bride has to prove yourself to her new
###1880 family, especially the women.
###1882 So it's kind of like a hazing, sort of, almost of women.
###1887 Still kind of not sure how to feel about this whole thing.
###1889 I kind of get the impression it might be the case of one
###1892 family not having lost a daughter so much as another
###1894 gaining a scullery maid.
###1897 She seems happy, says she's happy.

###1942 Manas or the finer points of Islam.
###1944 But for all the justifications we heard, it seems like the
###1947 real reason men kidnapped women in Kyrgyzstan is the
###1950 same reason they do questionable stuff anywhere,
###1953 the same reason a dog licks its balls--
###1955 because they can.
###1957 Which of course, is the oldest and shittiest
###1959 reason in the world.
