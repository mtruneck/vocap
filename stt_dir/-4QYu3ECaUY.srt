0:0:13,32 --> 0:0:27,7
place. We're doing on the top of a mountain.
Look at that!

0:0:27,7 --> 0:0:31,949
That counts, c'mon, that counts!
That wasn't down! That was not down.

Absolutely beautiful! Got some friends!
Heeeeeeey!

0:0:34,7 --> 0:0:39,78
We've put all of this together. Have a little
look at this. We have got some beautiful local


6
0:0:39,78 --> 0:0:41,879
cheeses. This is Bang cheese.
This is amazing.


7
0:0:41,879 --> 0:0:46,129
How did they make that?
I tell you, I do know what they do. They have

0:0:46,129 --> 0:0:52,26
a little.. this cheese, this bang cheese,
they have it.. it's about 6/7 inches, like


9
0:0:52,26 --> 0:0:55,36
a little Pecorino, they take the top off and
they've got this little stirry thing and it


10
0:0:55,36 --> 0:1:0,199
shaves it.
Potato salad. A lovely sweet potato, a little


11
0:1:0,199 --> 0:1:6,299
sort of galette with puff pastry, feta, nice
bits and pieces. Some salad, some lovely seafood.


12
0:1:6,299 --> 0:1:13,479
Over here we've got some dressing, we've got some roast chicken. Lovely! And a nice little fig and almond tart for dessert.


13
0:1:13,479 --> 0:1:17,7
There you go.
