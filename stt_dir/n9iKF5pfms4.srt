3
0:0:14,642 --> 0:0:17,39



4
0:0:17,39 --> 0:0:19,4
REPORTER: Some days are
just unforgettable.


5
0:0:19,4 --> 0:0:20,13
The birth of a child.


6
0:0:20,13 --> 0:0:21,37
Your first day at school.


7
0:0:21,37 --> 0:0:23,44
The day you fell in the
giant sinkhole.


8
0:0:23,44 --> 0:0:26,48
Well, at least that last part
is the reality for one woman


9
0:0:26,48 --> 0:0:27,73
in Plant City.


10
0:0:27,73 --> 0:0:40,22



11
0:0:40,22 --> 0:0:43,48
CARLA CHAPMAN: It
compresses you.


12
0:0:43,48 --> 0:0:46,65
It's hard to-- you can't
maneuver out of it.


13
0:0:46,65 --> 0:0:49,83
You're wiggling and you're
maneuvering more into it.


14
0:0:49,83 --> 0:0:55,13



15
0:0:55,13 --> 0:0:57,39
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: So we're
here in Central Florida to


16
0:0:57,39 --> 0:1:0,12
investigate the problem of
massive sinkholes being caused


17
0:1:0,12 --> 0:1:1,68
by groundwater pumping.


18
0:1:1,68 --> 0:1:4,31
Basically, to get fresh water,
they've caused all the porous


19
0:1:4,31 --> 0:1:7,55
limestone underneath central
Florida to start to cave in


20
0:1:7,55 --> 0:1:10,88
and crack, causing homes,
neighborhoods, cars to start


21
0:1:10,88 --> 0:1:12,57
falling into giant holes.


22
0:1:12,57 --> 0:1:14,86
So we're going to get to the
bottom of that story and find


23
0:1:14,86 --> 0:1:17,29
out if there are any
possible solutions.


24
0:1:17,29 --> 0:1:30,655



25
0:1:30,655 --> 0:1:31,15
Ah.


26
0:1:31,15 --> 0:1:33,13
Holy shit it's cold.


27
0:1:33,13 --> 0:1:41,55



28
0:1:41,55 --> 0:1:43,89
Sinkholes are the result of
groundwater pumping, the


29
0:1:43,89 --> 0:1:46,6
process we use to retrieve
80 billion gallons


30
0:1:46,6 --> 0:1:47,92
of water every day.


31
0:1:47,92 --> 0:1:49,65
The process is simple.


32
0:1:49,65 --> 0:1:52,12
Water falls from the sky and
sinks down through the ground


33
0:1:52,12 --> 0:1:54,6
to fill aquifers, which are
like massive underground


34
0:1:54,6 --> 0:1:55,9
vaults of water.


35
0:1:55,9 --> 0:1:58,34
By drilling into these
aquifers, we can pump


36
0:1:58,34 --> 0:1:59,66
freshwater out.


37
0:1:59,66 --> 0:2:2,45
It's cheap and, in theory, a
renewable source of drinking


38
0:2:2,45 --> 0:2:4,0
water for this country.


39
0:2:4,0 --> 0:2:6,9
More than half of our water is
already produced this way.


40
0:2:6,9 --> 0:2:9,74
Problem is we're using too
much of it too fast.


41
0:2:9,74 --> 0:2:12,35
We're draining aquifers faster
than they can be replenished,


42
0:2:12,35 --> 0:2:15,79
and it's compromising not only
wetlands, lakes, and rivers,


43
0:2:15,79 --> 0:2:18,22
but the structural integrity
of Florida's limestone


44
0:2:18,22 --> 0:2:19,5
foundation.


45
0:2:19,5 --> 0:2:22,17
In Florida, where 90 percent
of the population relies on


46
0:2:22,17 --> 0:2:25,15
groundwater for drinking, it's
no surprise that sinkholes


47
0:2:25,15 --> 0:2:27,8
swallow up new terrain
every day.


48
0:2:27,8 --> 0:2:34,65



49
0:2:34,65 --> 0:2:36,6
So we're right outside
of Gainesville.


50
0:2:36,6 --> 0:2:38,91
And this house right
here has a huge


51
0:2:38,91 --> 0:2:41,65
fucking hole in its backyard.


52
0:2:41,65 --> 0:2:45,81
Looks like it's about 80
yards across, maybe


53
0:2:45,81 --> 0:2:47,52
30, 40 yards deep.


54
0:2:47,52 --> 0:2:50,91
Just a fucking massive hole in
the center of the earth.


55
0:2:50,91 --> 0:2:52,44
We spoke to some of
the neighbors.


56
0:2:52,44 --> 0:2:55,56
No one wanted to appear on
camera, but they did know the


57
0:2:55,56 --> 0:2:56,55
people who lived here.


58
0:2:56,55 --> 0:2:58,78
And it happened in the
middle of the night.


59
0:2:58,78 --> 0:3:1,23
They said it sounded like
thunder and then suddenly went


60
0:3:1,23 --> 0:3:6,27
outside to find their backyard
had caved in.


61
0:3:6,27 --> 0:3:8,46
EMMA KNIGHT: The Floridan
aquifer, this is where we have


62
0:3:8,46 --> 0:3:10,32
all the water that's
underneath us.


63
0:3:10,32 --> 0:3:11,93
It's kind of like a bank
account, where you have a


64
0:3:11,93 --> 0:3:14,71
certain amount of money and you
have bills that need to be


65
0:3:14,71 --> 0:3:16,2
paid every month.


66
0:3:16,2 --> 0:3:18,76
And those could be the springs
and the rivers, that could be


67
0:3:18,76 --> 0:3:21,4
the uptake that used for
plants or trees.


68
0:3:21,4 --> 0:3:23,51
So you have withdrawals from
your account, direct


69
0:3:23,51 --> 0:3:26,34
withdrawals, which would be
people watering their lawns,


70
0:3:26,34 --> 0:3:29,6
washing their cars, cooling
towers from a power plant.


71
0:3:29,6 --> 0:3:30,785
And then there the deposits.


72
0:3:30,785 --> 0:3:34,2
And deposits are almost
exclusively from rainfall.


73
0:3:34,2 --> 0:3:36,53
And it's just the percentage
of rainfall that manages to


74
0:3:36,53 --> 0:3:38,86
percolate down to get right
back into the system.


75
0:3:38,86 --> 0:3:41,34
Right now, we happen to be in
a drought and we happen to


76
0:3:41,34 --> 0:3:43,65
have the highest amount
of consumptive use


77
0:3:43,65 --> 0:3:45,21
that we've ever had.


78
0:3:45,21 --> 0:3:48,242
And there isn't enough water.


79
0:3:48,242 --> 0:3:51,16



80
0:3:51,16 --> 0:3:52,97
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: So we're
trying to reach the family who


81
0:3:52,97 --> 0:3:56,24
lived here previously, , but
nobody has gone back to us.


82
0:3:56,24 --> 0:4:0,58
It's super terrifying to know
that we're in a neighborhood


83
0:4:0,58 --> 0:4:4,45
where there's a bunch of
families and literally, at any


84
0:4:4,45 --> 0:4:8,91
point, shit like this
can just open up.


85
0:4:8,91 --> 0:4:8,97
[TED CORELESS]


86
0:4:8,97 --> 0:4:13,18
If you've got a home with a 36
foot hole in the front yard,


87
0:4:13,18 --> 0:4:15,8
under the current definition
of what constitutes a


88
0:4:15,8 --> 0:4:16,91
sinkhole, that's not covered.


89
0:4:16,91 --> 0:4:19,279
Because it didn't affect
the house.


90
0:4:19,279 --> 0:4:21,29
Now forget about the fact it
completely destroys the value


91
0:4:21,29 --> 0:4:22,6
of the home.


92
0:4:22,6 --> 0:4:25,25
The idea was introduced and then
ultimately adopted in to


93
0:4:25,25 --> 0:4:29,31
law that required all property
insurers who sell insurance in


94
0:4:29,31 --> 0:4:32,77
the state of Florida to provide
sinkhole coverage.


95
0:4:32,77 --> 0:4:34,99
When the claims got to an
unacceptable level for the


96
0:4:34,99 --> 0:4:37,47
insurance industry, because
they felt they were losing


97
0:4:37,47 --> 0:4:41,44
money over that, there was a
real legislative push to try


98
0:4:41,44 --> 0:4:45,5
and address the issue by
discouraging claims.


99
0:4:45,5 --> 0:4:47,83
I mean, you can see the amount
of control that they're


100
0:4:47,83 --> 0:4:51,86
exercising over property rights
of people by being able


101
0:4:51,86 --> 0:4:55,91
to change the definition of what
constitutes a sinkhole.


102
0:4:55,91 --> 0:4:58,43
JILL HEINERTH: In Florida, we're
also over permitting.


103
0:4:58,43 --> 0:5:2,58
We're giving permits for
withdrawals of water, water


104
0:5:2,58 --> 0:5:4,55
that we simply don't have.


105
0:5:4,55 --> 0:5:8,34
So permits are being offered
to very large industrial


106
0:5:8,34 --> 0:5:13,42
operations, mining, or
agriculture in some cases.


107
0:5:13,42 --> 0:5:14,56
It's too much.


108
0:5:14,56 --> 0:5:16,83
We don't have that much
water to offer.


109
0:5:16,83 --> 0:5:19,42
And because of that, that's why
I see the flow declining


110
0:5:19,42 --> 0:5:24,23
in the springs and slowing
down over time.


111
0:5:24,23 --> 0:5:25,66
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: So if
groundwater pumping empties


112
0:5:25,66 --> 0:5:28,46
our aquifers and costs
homeowners billions in


113
0:5:28,46 --> 0:5:31,24
sinkhole damages, why
do we still do it?


114
0:5:31,24 --> 0:5:33,1
Because it's cheap.


115
0:5:33,1 --> 0:5:35,83
With population levels
skyrocketing, especially in


116
0:5:35,83 --> 0:5:38,24
Florida, the supply authorities
in charge of


117
0:5:38,24 --> 0:5:41,23
drinking water for Tampa Bay and
Saint Petersburg have to


118
0:5:41,23 --> 0:5:43,32
find a way to keep
the taps flowing.


119
0:5:43,32 --> 0:5:47,4
Tampa Bay water has increased
groundwater pumping by 400%


120
0:5:47,4 --> 0:5:52,11
since 1960, extracting 4.2
billion gallons of water each


121
0:5:52,11 --> 0:5:55,6
day from the Floridan aquifer
just to keep up.


122
0:5:55,6 --> 0:5:57,95
The first to pay for all this
pumping, of course, is the


123
0:5:57,95 --> 0:5:59,21
environment.


124
0:5:59,21 --> 0:6:1,78
Florida springs have been
up and rivers are soon


125
0:6:1,78 --> 0:6:4,14
predicted to follow.


126
0:6:4,14 --> 0:6:6,5
JILL HEINERTH: I've seen
the quantity of water


127
0:6:6,5 --> 0:6:7,18
disappearing.


128
0:6:7,18 --> 0:6:10,66
I've seen the lifeblood of
the planet slow down.


129
0:6:10,66 --> 0:6:13,13
There's less flow coming
out of these springs.


130
0:6:13,13 --> 0:6:17,13
And I've seen a continued
degrading of the quality of


131
0:6:17,13 --> 0:6:20,68
the water and the springs
and rivers.


132
0:6:20,68 --> 0:6:22,81
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: As more and
more sinkholes opened up,


133
0:6:22,81 --> 0:6:25,15
Tampa Bay Water was hit with
a number of lawsuits from


134
0:6:25,15 --> 0:6:27,9
property owners whose wells
had been over-pumped.


135
0:6:27,9 --> 0:6:30,53
They decided to try their hand
at making ocean water


136
0:6:30,53 --> 0:6:33,48
drinkable, so they proposed the
largest desalination plant


137
0:6:33,48 --> 0:6:36,94
in the Western Hemisphere, a
notoriously expensive solution


138
0:6:36,94 --> 0:6:39,96
Tampa's citizens weren't
exactly stoked about.


139
0:6:39,96 --> 0:6:42,8
Despite the amount of energy
required, the Tampa Bay


140
0:6:42,8 --> 0:6:45,58
desalination plant was
eventually approved and today


141
0:6:45,58 --> 0:6:48,158
provides around 10% of the
region's drinking water.


142
0:6:48,158 --> 0:6:52,28



143
0:6:52,28 --> 0:6:53,83
CHUCK CARDEN: 15 years
ago this region was


144
0:6:53,83 --> 0:6:55,25
suffering some drought.


145
0:6:55,25 --> 0:6:57,74
Looking for water sources other
than groundwater, this


146
0:6:57,74 --> 0:7:0,31
was an alternative
that we chose.


147
0:7:0,31 --> 0:7:3,24
There was a bunch of projects
we call alternative sources


148
0:7:3,24 --> 0:7:4,11
that were looked at.


149
0:7:4,11 --> 0:7:7,13
River waters, building
reservoirs, building a


150
0:7:7,13 --> 0:7:7,975
desalinization plant.


151
0:7:7,975 --> 0:7:11,11
We had engineers study it
and found out it was


152
0:7:11,11 --> 0:7:13,2
possible with the cost.


153
0:7:13,2 --> 0:7:15,23
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: And this was
the most cost effective?


154
0:7:15,23 --> 0:7:16,76
CHUCK CARDEN: It wasn't the most
cost effective, but it


155
0:7:16,76 --> 0:7:19,1
was most drought-proof.


156
0:7:19,1 --> 0:7:20,71
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: Can you give
us information on how


157
0:7:20,71 --> 0:7:24,6
much money it takes to keep
a place like running?


158
0:7:24,6 --> 0:7:25,15
CHUCK CARDEN: I will use
the rule of thumb.


159
0:7:25,15 --> 0:7:27,98
The plant is a 25 million
gallons a day plant.


160
0:7:27,98 --> 0:7:32,58
To run it, 25 million gallons a
day, on a 365 days, it would


161
0:7:32,58 --> 0:7:35,22
be about $20 million
in operations.


162
0:7:35,22 --> 0:7:37,7
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: So why,
in particular, is


163
0:7:37,7 --> 0:7:38,33
this the most expensive?


164
0:7:38,33 --> 0:7:40,5
CHUCK CARDEN: It's all because
of the power and to some


165
0:7:40,5 --> 0:7:41,6
degree the chemicals.


166
0:7:41,6 --> 0:7:45,2
But the power is close to 50%
of the operating cost.


167
0:7:45,2 --> 0:7:47,79
Just to keep the lights and the
pumps running, there's a


168
0:7:47,79 --> 0:7:49,7
lot of horsepower.


169
0:7:49,7 --> 0:7:52,4
It is more expensive than any
other sources, and it's more


170
0:7:52,4 --> 0:7:54,49
complicated than treating
groundwater.


171
0:7:54,49 --> 0:7:57,35
But when it gets down to you
don't have any water, it's a


172
0:7:57,35 --> 0:7:58,74
very viable solution.


173
0:7:58,74 --> 0:8:1,49
You need to go to the hospital
and the only vehicle you have


174
0:8:1,49 --> 0:8:3,11
is an SUV, you'll
get in that SUV.


175
0:8:3,11 --> 0:8:5,6
And it's the best way
to get in there.


176
0:8:5,6 --> 0:8:7,43
JILL HEINERTH: The bottom line
with drinking water is that


177
0:8:7,43 --> 0:8:9,14
when you use groundwater--


178
0:8:9,14 --> 0:8:12,16
Let's just say it
costs a penny.


179
0:8:12,16 --> 0:8:15,79
If you start withdrawing water
from a surface water body, a


180
0:8:15,79 --> 0:8:18,24
lake, a river, and have to clean
that deliver it to the


181
0:8:18,24 --> 0:8:20,33
public, that costs $0.10.


182
0:8:20,33 --> 0:8:24,6
If you have to desalinate the
same quantity of water, it


183
0:8:24,6 --> 0:8:26,1
costs a dollar.


184
0:8:26,1 --> 0:8:28,13
EMMA KNIGHT: There's springs
that are drying up all over


185
0:8:28,13 --> 0:8:29,15
the state of Florida.


186
0:8:29,15 --> 0:8:32,11
Flow is down at all
of the springs.


187
0:8:32,11 --> 0:8:38,848
What do we have to do to keep
everything from falling apart?


188
0:8:38,848 --> 0:8:40,25
[MUSIC- STEPHEN FOSTER,
"OLD FOLKS AT HOME"


189
0:8:40,25 --> 0:8:41,62
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: The
unfortunate reality is that


190
0:8:41,62 --> 0:8:43,95
we're already feeling the
pressures of a freshwater


191
0:8:43,95 --> 0:8:45,64
shortage in Florida.


192
0:8:45,64 --> 0:8:48,26
Houses are falling into
sinkholes, springs are drying


193
0:8:48,26 --> 0:8:51,2
up, and homeowners will continue
getting screwed by


194
0:8:51,2 --> 0:8:52,96
insurance companies,
unless someone's


195
0:8:52,96 --> 0:8:54,89
able to find a solution.


196
0:8:54,89 --> 0:8:57,62
The question really is whether
or not Florida will be able to


197
0:8:57,62 --> 0:9:0,59
pull itself together before
everybody ends up sitting in


198
0:9:0,59 --> 0:9:2,69
the sinkholes in their
backyards, drinking


199
0:9:2,69 --> 0:9:4,65
desalinated ocean water
out of Dixie cups.


200
0:9:4,65 --> 0:9:21,54



201
0:9:21,54 --> 0:9:23,35
MALE SPEAKER 1: No one has
