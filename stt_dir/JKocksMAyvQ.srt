1
0:1:0,102 --> 0:1:1,562
German bandits at two o'clock!


2
0:1:1,562 --> 0:1:8,235
Increase throttle! Power dive!


3
0:1:8,235 --> 0:1:10,571
Spell it right, Rafe.


4
0:1:10,571 --> 0:1:14,116
"Rudder" is spelled with two Ds.


5
0:1:14,116 --> 0:1:17,286
- Thanks, wingman.
- Yeah, sure.


6
0:1:17,286 --> 0:1:20,789
Whoa, bandits!


7
0:1:20,789 --> 0:1:22,291
Crack shootin', Danny.


8
0:1:22,291 --> 0:1:23,458
Crack shootin', Rafe.


9
0:1:23,458 --> 0:1:45,63
- Land of the free.
- Home of the brave.


10
0:1:45,63 --> 0:1:49,651
Great flyin',Dad!


11
0:1:49,651 --> 0:1:58,66
Come on.
I'm gonna teach you how to fly.


12
0:1:58,66 --> 0:1:59,995
I get the front!


13
0:1:59,995 --> 0:2:1,413
No, you take the back.


14
0:2:1,413 --> 0:2:3,665
I'm bigger,
and I should be in front.


15
0:2:3,665 --> 0:2:5,959
I'm older,
and I'm teachin', so no.


16
0:2:5,959 --> 0:2:7,92
Wow.
It's like we're really flying.


17
0:2:7,92 --> 0:2:9,338
Yeah, I did it lots of times.


18
0:2:9,338 --> 0:2:10,839
Come on, you man the guns.


19
0:2:10,839 --> 0:2:12,299
I'll give her some throttle.


20
0:2:12,299 --> 0:2:19,306
We gotta get those
dirty German bandits.


21
0:2:19,306 --> 0:2:27,231
Oh, gosh!


22
0:2:27,231 --> 0:2:31,86
- Hang on!
- Make it stop, Rafe!


23
0:2:31,86 --> 0:2:33,529
I've seen my dad
do this lots of times.


24
0:2:33,529 --> 0:2:37,199
Don't worry!


25
0:2:37,199 --> 0:2:40,202
Rafe!


26
0:2:40,202 --> 0:2:42,996
Oh, my gosh! We're flying!


27
0:2:42,996 --> 0:2:47,0
We're flying!


28
0:2:47,0 --> 0:2:58,554
Whoa! Uhh!


29
0:2:58,554 --> 0:3:1,223
Wow.


30
0:3:1,223 --> 0:3:2,891
My dad's gonna kill me.


31
0:3:2,891 --> 0:3:5,561
Come on.


32
0:3:5,561 --> 0:3:8,272
Yes! Whoo-hoo!


33
0:3:8,272 --> 0:3:9,481
We flew!


34
0:3:9,481 --> 0:3:11,567
We flew! Yes!
I'm a pilot!


35
0:3:11,567 --> 0:3:15,32
- I know!
- Yeah!


36
0:3:15,32 --> 0:3:16,613
We flew.


37
0:3:16,613 --> 0:3:18,407
- You no-account boy!
- Daddy-


38
0:3:18,407 --> 0:3:20,158
I done told you,
you spend time playing...


39
0:3:20,158 --> 0:3:22,411
with this stupid boy
can't read...


40
0:3:22,411 --> 0:3:24,121
you ain't never goin'
to amount to nothin'!


41
0:3:24,121 --> 0:3:26,874
He ain't stupid, Daddy!


42
0:3:26,874 --> 0:3:28,125
Daddy!


43
0:3:28,125 --> 0:3:30,85
Ohh!


44
0:3:30,85 --> 0:3:31,545
Come on!


45
0:3:31,545 --> 0:3:33,38
Uhh!


46
0:3:33,38 --> 0:3:38,76
Get on back home. Now!


47
0:3:38,76 --> 0:3:40,179
Get on up.


48
0:3:40,179 --> 0:3:41,93
You got work to do.


49
0:3:41,93 --> 0:3:44,6
Come on! Come on, get on home!


50
0:3:44,6 --> 0:3:46,894
Uhh!


51
0:3:46,894 --> 0:3:50,23
You let him alone!


52
0:3:50,23 --> 0:3:52,107
Daddy, no!


53
0:3:52,107 --> 0:3:54,526
I will bust you open,
you dirty German!


54
0:3:54,526 --> 0:3:58,822
What'd you call me?


55
0:3:58,822 --> 0:4:1,95
I fought the Germans in France.


56
0:4:1,95 --> 0:4:5,996
And I fought 'em
in the trenches.


57
0:4:5,996 --> 0:4:8,207
And I pray to God
no one ever has to see...


58
0:4:8,207 --> 0:4:25,933
the things that I saw.


59
0:4:25,933 --> 0:4:30,312
You're my bestfriend.


60
0:4:30,312 --> 0:4:34,358
Daddy, wait!


61
0:4:34,358 --> 0:4:42,533
Daddy, wait.


62
0:4:42,533 --> 0:4:44,117
Adolf Hitler...


63
0:4:44,117 --> 0:4:46,161
builds the German
military machine...


64
0:4:46,161 --> 0:4:48,288
and drags
all of Europe into war.


65
0:4:48,288 --> 0:4:50,666
But even while France
falls to Hitler...


66
0:4:50,666 --> 0:5:11,728
America still refuses
to join the fighting.


67
0:5:11,728 --> 0:5:15,524
- Where's McCawley and Walker?
- Still training, sir.


68
0:5:15,524 --> 0:5:17,651
Alright, Danny.
Now let's show 'em how to fly.


69
0:5:17,651 --> 0:5:19,69
We're gonna play chicken.
You ready?


70
0:5:19,69 --> 0:5:21,446
This ain't the farm,
and these ain't no cropdusters.


71
0:5:21,446 --> 0:5:22,656
I'm not playing
chicken with you.


72
0:5:22,656 --> 0:5:24,199
Now don't be a baby.
I'll tell you what-


73
0:5:24,199 --> 0:5:26,618
- I'm not doing it, Rafe.
- Well, I'm coming right at you.


74
0:5:26,618 --> 0:5:31,29
You can turn, or you can hit me.
It's up to you.


75
0:5:31,29 --> 0:5:32,499
What the-


76
0:5:32,499 --> 0:5:37,4
Oh, boy.


77
0:5:37,4 --> 0:5:39,381
Why you always
bustin' my ass, Rafe?


78
0:5:39,381 --> 0:5:42,593
Which way you goin'?


79
0:5:42,593 --> 0:5:47,723
I guess I'll go right.
No, uh, left. I'll go left.


80
0:5:47,723 --> 0:5:49,16
OK, we're goin' left, right?


81
0:5:49,16 --> 0:5:50,392
Ri-uh, right. Right?


82
0:5:50,392 --> 0:5:52,477
Right like we're goin' right,
or right like we're goin' left?


83
0:5:52,477 --> 0:5:54,62
Well, now you got me
all mixed up!


84
0:5:54,62 --> 0:5:58,4
I don't know.
Make up your mind.


85
0:5:58,4 --> 0:6:1,403
God, Rafe, we're going right!
Righty-tighty!


86
0:6:1,403 --> 0:6:4,99
Aah!


87
0:6:4,99 --> 0:6:11,121
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!


88
0:6:11,121 --> 0:6:13,207
Those are some smooth aces.


89
0:6:13,207 --> 0:6:15,375
Did you say something?


90
0:6:15,375 --> 0:6:17,628
'Cause let me tell ya,
those farm boys are grounded!


91
0:6:17,628 --> 0:6:19,963
Yes, sir, an entirely
unacceptable use...


92
0:6:19,963 --> 0:6:24,92
of m-m-military aircraft, sir.


93
0:6:24,92 --> 0:6:25,594
- Get my hat.
- Yes, sir.


94
0:6:25,594 --> 0:6:28,722
Get those hedge-hoppers
in Doolittle's office.


95
0:6:28,722 --> 0:6:31,99
After two years of training...


96
0:6:31,99 --> 0:6:33,519
you believe that
a $45,000 airplane...


97
0:6:33,519 --> 0:6:35,62
is there for your amusement?


98
0:6:35,62 --> 0:6:36,355
No, sir.
I was just trying...


99
0:6:36,355 --> 0:6:37,689
to keep my edge, Major.


100
0:6:37,689 --> 0:6:39,566
And when you did
the outside loop last week...


101
0:6:39,566 --> 0:6:42,69
what did you think that was?
Honing your skills?


102
0:6:42,69 --> 0:6:43,403
That's not training, McCawley.


103
0:6:43,403 --> 0:6:44,696
That's a stunt.


104
0:6:44,696 --> 0:6:46,99
And I personally
consider it to be reckless...


105
0:6:46,99 --> 0:6:50,536
and irresponsible.


106
0:6:50,536 --> 0:6:54,414
Major...


107
0:6:54,414 --> 0:6:55,749
How could that be,
when you're famous...


108
0:6:55,749 --> 0:6:57,459
for being the first man
in the world ever to do it?


109
0:6:57,459 --> 0:6:58,669
Don't get cute with me, son.


110
0:6:58,669 --> 0:7:1,171
No, sir, I don't mean
to be disrespectful.


111
0:7:1,171 --> 0:7:4,7
I just think that-
well, I-


112
0:7:4,7 --> 0:7:5,259
It is reckless
and irresponsible...


113
0:7:5,259 --> 0:7:6,552
if you're just doing it
to be a show-off.


114
0:7:6,552 --> 0:7:10,264
But I was doing it to try
to inspire the men, sir...


115
0:7:10,264 --> 0:7:11,64
in the way that
you've inspired me.


116
0:7:11,64 --> 0:7:13,809
I believe the French
even have a word for that...


117
0:7:13,809 --> 0:7:15,644
when the men get together
to honor their leaders.


118
0:7:15,644 --> 0:7:17,104
They call it an homage, sir.


119
0:7:17,104 --> 0:7:18,981
- A what?
- An homage, sir.


120
0:7:18,981 --> 0:7:23,986
That's bullshit, McCawley!


121
0:7:23,986 --> 0:7:27,114
But it's very,
very good bullshit.


122
0:7:27,114 --> 0:7:31,76
Thank you, sir.


123
0:7:31,76 --> 0:7:34,788
McCawley, you remind me
of myself fifteen years ago.


124
0:7:34,788 --> 0:7:36,832
Which is why we need
to discuss this.


125
0:7:36,832 --> 0:7:46,508
Have a seat, son.


126
0:7:46,508 --> 0:7:49,386
The British have accepted you
into the Eagle Squadron.


127
0:7:49,386 --> 0:7:51,847
You're on your way
to England tomorrow...


128
0:7:51,847 --> 0:7:54,16
if you still want to go.


129
0:7:54,16 --> 0:7:56,518
Huh. Wow.


130
0:7:56,518 --> 0:7:58,52
Just a few British pilots
are all that stand...


131
0:7:58,52 --> 0:8:0,939
between Hitler
and total victory in Europe.


132
0:8:0,939 --> 0:8:3,25
They're gonna need
all the help they can get.


133
0:8:3,25 --> 0:8:4,484
Yes, sir.
Well, I'm on my way.


134
0:8:4,484 --> 0:8:6,862
Just for the record...


135
0:8:6,862 --> 0:8:8,822
I'm supposed to ask you
to reconsider.


136
0:8:8,822 --> 0:8:10,407
Sir?


137
0:8:10,407 --> 0:8:12,409
Sooner or later
we're gonna be in this war...


138
0:8:12,409 --> 0:8:14,453
whether we like it or not.


139
0:8:14,453 --> 0:8:16,83
And I'm gonna need
all of my best pilots.


140
0:8:16,83 --> 0:8:19,708
So it's my duty
to ask you to stay.


141
0:8:19,708 --> 0:8:25,214
Major, what would you do?


142
0:8:25,214 --> 0:8:29,218
If it was me...


143
0:8:29,218 --> 0:8:31,428
I'd go.


144
0:8:31,428 --> 0:8:33,68
Get out. Am I going bald
right back here?


145
0:8:33,68 --> 0:8:34,89
Ooh!


146
0:8:34,89 --> 0:8:38,185
Man, I am one good-lookin'
son of a bitch.


147
0:8:38,185 --> 0:8:39,853
Don't you ever die.


148
0:8:39,853 --> 0:8:42,523
Die. That's exactly...


149
0:8:42,523 --> 0:8:45,609
the concept
you gotta work tonight.


150
0:8:45,609 --> 0:8:49,71
You put a drop of this clove oil
under your eyes...


151
0:8:49,71 --> 0:8:51,156
and you let 'em sting
and well up.


152
0:8:51,156 --> 0:8:54,576
You get your nurse alone,
take a breath...


153
0:8:54,576 --> 0:8:56,995
let her see your eyes glisten...


154
0:8:56,995 --> 0:9:1,5
and say, "Baby,
they're training me for war...


155
0:9:1,5 --> 0:9:4,419
"and I don't know
what'll happen...


156
0:9:4,419 --> 0:9:7,756
"but if I die tomorrow,
I want to know...


157
0:9:7,756 --> 0:9:11,76
"that we lived
all we could tonight. "


158
0:9:11,76 --> 0:9:13,762
Come on, guys!
We got nurses waitin'.


159
0:9:13,762 --> 0:9:16,64
Come on, before the rest
of his hair falls out.


160
0:9:16,64 --> 0:9:20,143
How could you do this?


161
0:9:20,143 --> 0:9:21,728
Well, Doolittle assigned me.


162
0:9:21,728 --> 0:9:25,23
He wanted me to get some real-
real combat training in.


163
0:9:25,23 --> 0:9:26,233
Well, guess what?


164
0:9:26,233 --> 0:9:28,443
It's not training over there.
It's war.


165
0:9:28,443 --> 0:9:30,779
Where the losers die,
and there aren't any winners-


166
0:9:30,779 --> 0:9:32,3
just guys who turn
into broken-down wrecks...


167
0:9:32,3 --> 0:9:33,24
like my father.


168
0:9:33,24 --> 0:9:34,491
Yeah, I understand that, Danny.


169
0:9:34,491 --> 0:9:35,826
But I feel like
I got a duty to go.


170
0:9:35,826 --> 0:9:37,953
Don't preach to me
about duty, damn it.


171
0:9:37,953 --> 0:9:39,788
I wear the same uniform you do.


172
0:9:39,788 --> 0:9:42,666
Now, if trouble wants me,
I'm ready for it.


173
0:9:42,666 --> 0:9:43,876
But why go looking for it?


174
0:9:43,876 --> 0:9:46,3
God, Danny, come on.


175
0:9:46,3 --> 0:9:48,463
I'm gonna be twenty-five.
I might as well be an old man.


176
0:9:48,463 --> 0:9:50,549
They're gonna have me bein'
a flight instructor.


177
0:9:50,549 --> 0:9:53,1
I don't wanna teach
loops and barrel rolls.


178
0:9:53,1 --> 0:9:54,386
I wanna be a combat fighter.


179
0:9:54,386 --> 0:9:55,596
Hey, come on!


180
0:9:55,596 --> 0:9:58,807
The nurses can't
d- d-dance by themselves.


181
0:9:58,807 --> 0:10:9,651
Let's go.


182
0:10:9,651 --> 0:10:12,446
If the call of duty
means seeing 150 men...


183
0:10:12,446 --> 0:10:13,989
in their underwear every day...


184
0:10:13,989 --> 0:10:16,491
we are here to serve.


185
0:10:16,491 --> 0:10:17,743
I can't believe it.


186
0:10:17,743 --> 0:10:19,828
Saturday night
in New York City.


187
0:10:19,828 --> 0:10:21,497
Do you know what they're doing
where I come from?


188
0:10:21,497 --> 0:10:22,998
Nothing.


189
0:10:22,998 --> 0:10:24,833
Cow-tipping.


190
0:10:24,833 --> 0:10:26,84
Well, that's why
you joined the Navy, hon'.


191
0:10:26,84 --> 0:10:28,337
To get out of that dusty
little town and see the world.


192
0:10:28,337 --> 0:10:31,48
May I remind you, Barbara,
we're Navy nurses, not tourists.


193
0:10:31,48 --> 0:10:33,884
I joined to do
my patriotic duty and...


194
0:10:33,884 --> 0:10:36,136
to meet guys.


195
0:10:36,136 --> 0:10:37,638
Me, too.


196
0:10:37,638 --> 0:10:39,389
Girls, we're gonna have
so much fun tonight in the city.


197
0:10:39,389 --> 0:10:40,974
You've gotta tell them
the story, Evelyn.


198
0:10:40,974 --> 0:10:42,893
What?


199
0:10:42,893 --> 0:10:44,186
Oh, come on. Tell us.


200
0:10:44,186 --> 0:10:45,729
Oh, it's such a long story.


201
0:10:45,729 --> 0:10:47,731
We got time.


202
0:10:47,731 --> 0:10:49,65
I saw it happen.


203
0:10:49,65 --> 0:10:51,902
Well, it was
about four weeks ago...


204
0:10:51,902 --> 0:10:54,29
What do you think
is b-b-better?


205
0:10:54,29 --> 0:10:57,699
All in the one cheek,
or spreading them out?


206
0:10:57,699 --> 0:10:58,867
OK.


207
0:10:58,867 --> 0:11:5,999
Fusco, Anthony.


208
0:11:5,999 --> 0:11:7,876
You all right, buddy?


209
0:11:7,876 --> 0:11:10,17
Sweetie, do you really
have to do this?


210
0:11:10,17 --> 0:11:13,298
I'm not gonna get yellow fever
in my barracks.


211
0:11:13,298 --> 0:11:20,848
No? If you'd rather,
she can do it.


212
0:11:20,848 --> 0:11:23,225
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Just gimme a minute.


213
0:11:23,225 --> 0:11:26,562
Honey, the government
says stick 'em, we stick 'em.


214
0:11:26,562 --> 0:11:30,774
Uh!


215
0:11:30,774 --> 0:11:34,653
Hey, Red, you alright?


216
0:11:34,653 --> 0:11:38,73
Eye exam number four?


217
0:11:38,73 --> 0:11:41,743
Listen, Doc, I have passed
a dozen medical checks.


218
0:11:41,743 --> 0:11:43,996
You write that,
they won't let me fly.


219
0:11:43,996 --> 0:11:46,54
Sorry, son.


220
0:11:46,54 --> 0:11:48,0
I'm gonna fail.


221
0:11:48,0 --> 0:11:49,668
They're gonna
take my wings away.


222
0:11:49,668 --> 0:11:51,962
No, they won't. Just relax.


223
0:11:51,962 --> 0:11:53,589
Read the bottom line, please.


224
0:11:53,589 --> 0:11:54,923
Just keep practicin'
the bottom line.


225
0:11:54,923 --> 0:11:56,8
And don't worry.
I'm right behind you.


226
0:11:56,8 --> 0:12:3,432
J- L-M-K-P-O-


227
0:12:3,432 --> 0:12:5,1
Next.


228
0:12:5,1 --> 0:12:9,563
Ma'am.


229
0:12:9,563 --> 0:12:12,608
J- L-M-K-P-O-E-T-X.


230
0:12:12,608 --> 0:12:14,109
Eyes like an eagle, ma'am.


231
0:12:14,109 --> 0:12:16,28
Slow down, flyboy.


232
0:12:16,28 --> 0:12:18,822
And, instead of the bottom,
read the very top. Both eyes.


233
0:12:18,822 --> 0:12:21,992
Yeah.


234
0:12:21,992 --> 0:12:25,454
"C"- sorry, "J."


235
0:12:25,454 --> 0:12:27,456
Ahem. "C"...


236
0:12:27,456 --> 0:12:28,79
- "W."
- "W."


237
0:12:28,79 --> 0:12:31,84
- "Q."
- Uh, "Q."


238
0:12:31,84 --> 0:12:35,38
Uh, "'Q."'


239
0:12:35,38 --> 0:12:37,591
Read the bottom line
again, please.


240
0:12:37,591 --> 0:12:48,31
But read it right to left
and every other letter.


241
0:12:48,31 --> 0:12:49,978
"E."


242
0:12:49,978 --> 0:12:52,648
Heh. "'X."'


243
0:12:52,648 --> 0:12:55,25
- X-E.
- X-E.


244
0:12:55,25 --> 0:12:57,486
X- E, ma'am.


245
0:12:57,486 --> 0:13:0,155
Ma'am, I know how this looks.


246
0:13:0,155 --> 0:13:1,865
I'm sorry, Lieutenant,
I really am.


247
0:13:1,865 --> 0:13:4,34
But Army and Navy
requires 20/20 vision.


248
0:13:4,34 --> 0:13:6,745
Oh, i-it's-it's not
a problem with my eyes.


249
0:13:6,745 --> 0:13:7,996
I mean, I can see.


250
0:13:7,996 --> 0:13:9,832
I mean, I can hit a running
rabbit with a $3.00 pistol.


251
0:13:9,832 --> 0:13:11,458
I got a problem with letters,
that's all.


252
0:13:11,458 --> 0:13:13,85
Well, maybe after
some schooling...


253
0:13:13,85 --> 0:13:14,753
you could come back
and take the test again.


254
0:13:14,753 --> 0:13:16,46
No, I had schooling.


255
0:13:16,46 --> 0:13:17,422
I mean, I-the teachers
just never knew...


256
0:13:17,422 --> 0:13:19,424
what to make of it.
It's just letters.


257
0:13:19,424 --> 0:13:20,968
I mix 'em up sometimes.
That's all.


258
0:13:20,968 --> 0:13:24,346
I mean, I just get 'em
backward sometimes.


259
0:13:24,346 --> 0:13:27,85
L- look here. Uh, my-my math
and-and spacial reasoning...


260
0:13:27,85 --> 0:13:29,268
and my verbal scores
are all excellent.


261
0:13:29,268 --> 0:13:31,144
But you barely passed
the written exam.


262
0:13:31,144 --> 0:13:33,355
Yeah, but he did pass it.
So, is it my turn now?


263
0:13:33,355 --> 0:13:36,692
- No, you'll wait your turn.
- Yes, ma'am.


264
0:13:36,692 --> 0:13:38,986
Ma'am, I-I'm never gonna
be an English teacher.


265
0:13:38,986 --> 0:13:41,53
But I know why I'm here.


266
0:13:41,53 --> 0:13:43,73
To be a pilot.


267
0:13:43,73 --> 0:13:44,783
And you don't dogfight
with manuals.


268
0:13:44,783 --> 0:13:46,827
You don't fly with gauges.


269
0:13:46,827 --> 0:13:48,162
I mean, it's all about
feeling and speed...


270
0:13:48,162 --> 0:13:49,538
and lettin' that plane
become like a part...


271
0:13:49,538 --> 0:13:51,206
of your body.
And that manual...


272
0:13:51,206 --> 0:13:53,542
says that a guy who's a slow
reader can't be a good pilot.


273
0:13:53,542 --> 0:13:59,339
That file says I'm
the best pilot in this room.


274
0:13:59,339 --> 0:14:6,221
Ma'am, please,
don't take my wings.


275
0:14:6,221 --> 0:14:8,56
Well, I felt so bad.


276
0:14:8,56 --> 0:14:10,851
Evelyn, rotate to station three.


277
0:14:10,851 --> 0:14:12,227
I had no choice.


278
0:14:12,227 --> 0:14:14,271
I passed him.


279
0:14:14,271 --> 0:14:15,647
- Good.
- Uh-huh.


280
0:14:15,647 --> 0:14:18,609
So, then this
cocky pilot comes back.


281
0:14:18,609 --> 0:14:20,944
- Say, fella, are you enlisted?
- Yeah.


282
0:14:20,944 --> 0:14:23,113
"Yeah"? Boy,
you're talking to an officer.


283
0:14:23,113 --> 0:14:24,448
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.


284
0:14:24,448 --> 0:14:25,741
- Give me that file.
- Yes, sir.


285
0:14:25,741 --> 0:14:28,16
- Parade rest.
- Yes, sir.


286
0:14:28,16 --> 0:14:29,912
Ma'am, I didn't get
a chance to thank you.


287
0:14:29,912 --> 0:14:31,246
Drop your skivvies.


288
0:14:31,246 --> 0:14:34,291
Ah, oh, OK.


289
0:14:34,291 --> 0:14:37,127
Just like this?


290
0:14:37,127 --> 0:14:39,4
That's fine.


291
0:14:39,4 --> 0:14:41,757
He did have
a very cute butt.


292
0:14:41,757 --> 0:14:43,3
You know, I know
you didn't have to pass me...


293
0:14:43,3 --> 0:14:44,635
and you did. And I just-


294
0:14:44,635 --> 0:14:47,471
I didn't think
you'd understand, and you did.


295
0:14:47,471 --> 0:14:50,182
You know, you still
haven't said thank you.


296
0:14:50,182 --> 0:14:51,391
Thank you.


297
0:14:51,391 --> 0:14:53,435
You're welcome.


298
0:14:53,435 --> 0:14:56,48
Why'd you do it?
I mean, I'm just curious.


299
0:14:56,48 --> 0:14:58,273
You're like my hero now.


300
0:14:58,273 --> 0:15:0,15
Actually, my father was a pilot.


301
0:15:0,15 --> 0:15:2,528
And, um, I've seen
first-hand what happens...


302
0:15:2,528 --> 0:15:4,196
when a pilot loses his wings.


303
0:15:4,196 --> 0:15:5,447
You know what?


304
0:15:5,447 --> 0:15:7,783
Your father's my hero,
then, too.


305
0:15:7,783 --> 0:15:11,411
Infact, as an officer,
I think it'd by my duty...


306
0:15:11,411 --> 0:15:13,789
to take my new hero's
daughter out tonight...


307
0:15:13,789 --> 0:15:16,124
Just to-aah!


308
0:15:16,124 --> 0:15:17,543
Gosh, did I poke too deep?


309
0:15:17,543 --> 0:15:21,63
I think you hit the bone there.


310
0:15:21,63 --> 0:15:25,3
You are so mean.


311
0:15:25,3 --> 0:15:27,97
What? So is-
is there any chance...


312
0:15:27,97 --> 0:15:30,305
that you might,
kind of, sort of...


313
0:15:30,305 --> 0:15:32,975
you know, like me, or...


314
0:15:32,975 --> 0:15:37,229
Oh, how did you guess?


315
0:15:37,229 --> 0:15:38,814
They never taught us...


316
0:15:38,814 --> 0:15:43,652
how to deal with this...
feeling.


317
0:15:43,652 --> 0:15:45,654
Wh-what feeling?


318
0:15:45,654 --> 0:15:48,991
Well, it's kind of like... this.


319
0:15:48,991 --> 0:15:50,659
Ow!


320
0:15:50,659 --> 0:15:54,83
Well, he was getting fresh,
so I poked him again.


321
0:15:54,83 --> 0:15:58,167
All right, Romeo.
I want to get this over with.


322
0:15:58,167 --> 0:16:0,419
Hold on a second.


323
0:16:0,419 --> 0:16:1,545
Miss...


324
0:16:1,545 --> 0:16:5,924
I really, really lick you.


325
0:16:5,924 --> 0:16:7,509
What did he mean?


326
0:16:7,509 --> 0:16:9,303
Like you.


327
0:16:9,303 --> 0:16:10,596
I didn't mean to say that.


328
0:16:10,596 --> 0:16:11,93
And I just, um...


329
0:16:11,93 --> 0:16:14,349
I just want to ask you, please,
if I can donate dinner.


330
0:16:14,349 --> 0:16:16,518
He started
to act very strange.


331
0:16:16,518 --> 0:16:19,563
Or, well, buy you dinner.


332
0:16:19,563 --> 0:16:21,19
This isn't your chart.


333
0:16:21,19 --> 0:16:23,358
Whoa.


334
0:16:23,358 --> 0:16:27,446
No. That's the, uh, this,
uh, fellow over here's.


335
0:16:27,446 --> 0:16:28,655
I think he left.


336
0:16:28,655 --> 0:16:30,365
Have you already had this shot?


337
0:16:30,365 --> 0:16:34,536
Yeah, well, once... already.


338
0:16:34,536 --> 0:16:37,39
Well, I wanted-
I mean, can I ask you out?


339
0:16:37,39 --> 0:16:39,166
No!


340
0:16:39,166 --> 0:16:42,503
And he just went wham!


341
0:16:42,503 --> 0:16:45,47
Unh!


342
0:16:45,47 --> 0:16:47,424
Oh! What'd you do to him?


343
0:16:47,424 --> 0:16:53,13
Poor guy.


344
0:16:53,13 --> 0:16:56,517
Hey!


345
0:16:56,517 --> 0:16:57,976
Oh, my God.
Are you OK?


346
0:16:57,976 --> 0:17:0,187
Uh, yeah.


347
0:17:0,187 --> 0:17:1,73
I'm fine. I feel great.


348
0:17:1,73 --> 0:17:6,235
This is just standard
precautionary... thing.


349
0:17:6,235 --> 0:17:9,738
Look, I got some, uh,
genuine French champagne...


350
0:17:9,738 --> 0:17:11,31
from France.


351
0:17:11,31 --> 0:17:13,742
I thought, you know,
maybe we could celebrate.


352
0:17:13,742 --> 0:17:15,16
Celebrate what?


353
0:17:15,16 --> 0:17:22,125
Oh, I don't know. Uh, well,
you being my hero, for one.


354
0:17:22,125 --> 0:17:26,964
OK. Why not?


355
0:17:26,964 --> 0:17:28,882
So, uh, ahem...


356
0:17:28,882 --> 0:17:30,384
I wanted to thank you.


357
0:17:30,384 --> 0:17:32,219
And I just wanted to, uh...


358
0:17:32,219 --> 0:17:34,763
put your mind at ease
about passing me...


359
0:17:34,763 --> 0:17:37,933
because I really do think
you did this country a service.


360
0:17:37,933 --> 0:17:41,436
I mean, I'm-
I am a great flier.


361
0:17:41,436 --> 0:17:44,439
And if you have a fault,
which you obviously don't...


362
0:17:44,439 --> 0:17:47,109
it's modesty.


363
0:17:47,109 --> 0:17:52,489
No. If I have a fault,
it's candor.


364
0:17:52,489 --> 0:17:56,66
You are just so-


365
0:17:56,66 --> 0:18:8,589
Uhh. Cork just got away from me.


366
0:18:8,589 --> 0:18:10,174
God, oh, it hurts.


367
0:18:10,174 --> 0:18:13,927
It hurts something fierce.


368
0:18:13,927 --> 0:18:15,137
I'm sorry.


369
0:18:15,137 --> 0:18:16,763
- Ohh...
- Oh, it's bleeding.


370
0:18:16,763 --> 0:18:18,932
- God.
- Oh!


371
0:18:18,932 --> 0:18:21,18
- Ohh!
- Lay still.


372
0:18:21,18 --> 0:18:22,227
I ruined everything.


373
0:18:22,227 --> 0:18:23,645
- Lay still.
- Oh, it hurts.


374
0:18:23,645 --> 0:18:25,814
- Ow! It's cold.
- It'll stop the bleeding.


375
0:18:25,814 --> 0:18:27,482
Yeah. I can't breathe.


376
0:18:27,482 --> 0:18:33,989
Lay still.


377
0:18:33,989 --> 0:18:36,366
You are so beautiful it hurts.


378
0:18:36,366 --> 0:18:39,536
It's your nose that hurts.


379
0:18:39,536 --> 0:18:50,464
No. I think it's my heart.


380
0:18:50,464 --> 0:18:53,467
And then I kissed him.


381
0:18:53,467 --> 0:18:56,11
Oh, Evelyn.


382
0:18:56,11 --> 0:18:58,722
That's the most romantic story
I ever heard.


383
0:18:58,722 --> 0:19:4,353
It's been the most romantic four
weeks and two days of my life.


384
0:19:4,353 --> 0:19:25,541
Oh, I'm so jealous.


385
0:19:25,541 --> 0:19:26,959
Hello, Lieutenant.


386
0:19:26,959 --> 0:19:29,336
- It's good to see you.
- You, too, Lieutenant.


387
0:19:29,336 --> 0:19:35,467
Pick a hand.


388
0:19:35,467 --> 0:19:39,137
It's beautiful.


389
0:19:39,137 --> 0:19:41,139
What's in your other hand?


390
0:19:41,139 --> 0:19:44,601
Mine.


391
0:19:44,601 --> 0:19:49,231
Well, it took me six hours
to fold these.


392
0:19:49,231 --> 0:19:52,901
Oh!


393
0:19:52,901 --> 0:19:55,28
I want you to meet my friends.


394
0:19:55,28 --> 0:19:58,282
Rafe, this is Martha,
Barbara, Sandra-


395
0:19:58,282 --> 0:20:1,118
- Hi. I'm Betty.
- Hi.


396
0:20:1,118 --> 0:20:3,412
Would you happen
to have any friends?


397
0:20:3,412 --> 0:20:6,915
Huh. Take your pick.


398
0:20:6,915 --> 0:20:14,6
Hi.


399
0:20:14,6 --> 0:20:32,983
Whoo!


400
0:20:32,983 --> 0:20:35,319
We ever get in this war
and somethin' happens to me...


401
0:20:35,319 --> 0:20:39,364
I can't tell you how good
it makes me feel to know...


402
0:20:39,364 --> 0:20:41,867
that someone as sweet
as you will be there...


403
0:20:41,867 --> 0:20:43,619
to nurse me back to health.


404
0:20:43,619 --> 0:20:46,38
Good, but we're not
in the war yet.


405
0:20:46,38 --> 0:20:48,624
- Ahem.
- OK. That was a bad line.


406
0:20:48,624 --> 0:20:51,1
Hi.


407
0:20:51,1 --> 0:20:53,629
I'm-I'm Red.


408
0:20:53,629 --> 0:20:59,301
Red-
S- s-s-s-strange.


409
0:20:59,301 --> 0:21:1,178
Heh heh.
Your last name's Strange?


410
0:21:1,178 --> 0:21:2,638
Yeah. She's all yours, soldier.


411
0:21:2,638 --> 0:21:6,808
No. It-it's Winkle.


412
0:21:6,808 --> 0:21:8,602
Red is such a ladies' man.


413
0:21:8,602 --> 0:21:9,811
Do you always stutter?


414
0:21:9,811 --> 0:21:13,649
No. Only when I'm-


415
0:21:13,649 --> 0:21:14,9
She's totally buying it.


416
0:21:14,9 --> 0:21:16,818
- Nervous?
- Yeah.


417
0:21:16,818 --> 0:21:26,829
Why can't I get
something like that?


418
0:21:26,829 --> 0:21:28,8
Hello.


419
0:21:28,8 --> 0:21:29,665
Hi.


420
0:21:29,665 --> 0:21:32,334
Danny seems kind of shy
around the girls.


421
0:21:32,334 --> 0:21:35,838
Tsk. It's not that he's shy.


422
0:21:35,838 --> 0:21:37,172
He's just, ahem...


423
0:21:37,172 --> 0:21:39,675
a little unsure of himself,
you know.


424
0:21:39,675 --> 0:21:41,635
His old man used to
run him down a lot.


425
0:21:41,635 --> 0:21:45,389
Get him in a plane,
he's sure of himself.


426
0:21:45,389 --> 0:21:47,683
He's like my brother.
He's like my best friend.


427
0:21:47,683 --> 0:21:50,394
He's my right hand.


428
0:21:50,394 --> 0:21:54,857
Which at the moment is
a long way south of my waist.


429
0:21:54,857 --> 0:21:56,525
Oh, I'm sorry.


430
0:21:56,525 --> 0:21:59,194
I guess I lost
a little altitude.


431
0:21:59,194 --> 0:22:1,238
Yeah, I guess you did.


432
0:22:1,238 --> 0:22:17,337
Excuse me.


433
0:22:17,337 --> 0:22:19,798
You and me, we got to talk.


434
0:22:19,798 --> 0:22:23,51
So, the rumor is the Navy's
shipping us to Pearl Harbor.


435
0:22:23,51 --> 0:22:25,512
Well, won't be so bad.


436
0:22:25,512 --> 0:22:28,182
It's about as far from
the fighting as you can get.


437
0:22:28,182 --> 0:22:30,58
You'll get a sun tan.


438
0:22:30,58 --> 0:22:33,77
So maybe the Army'll
post you guys there, too.


439
0:22:33,77 --> 0:22:37,9
You... are a super special woman.


440
0:22:37,9 --> 0:22:40,861
And, and, well...


441
0:22:40,861 --> 0:22:42,821
Well, they're-
they're training me...


442
0:22:42,821 --> 0:22:50,412
to be a big bad warrior,
and, well...


443
0:22:50,412 --> 0:22:52,581
So, I mean, you never know
what might happen tomorrow...


444
0:22:52,581 --> 0:22:58,212
or... or any day
after that, you know?


445
0:22:58,212 --> 0:23:0,797
So...


446
0:23:0,797 --> 0:23:3,926
God, we need to make
tonight super special.


447
0:23:3,926 --> 0:23:6,595
Why are you crying?


448
0:23:6,595 --> 0:23:8,263
I guess it's the thought...


449
0:23:8,263 --> 0:23:10,766
that I might not ever
get to see you again.


450
0:23:10,766 --> 0:23:12,601
Dry your eyes, toots.


451
0:23:12,601 --> 0:23:13,81
Tonight, you're mine.


452
0:23:13,81 --> 0:23:16,21
I don't want to be
with a crowd tonight.


453
0:23:16,21 --> 0:23:18,607
I just want to be
alone with you.


454
0:23:18,607 --> 0:23:20,609
Well...


455
0:23:20,609 --> 0:23:23,654
How does New York Harbor
by moonlight sound?


456
0:23:23,654 --> 0:23:25,822
Ohh! Heh heh!


457
0:23:25,822 --> 0:23:28,325
Are you gonna be
a bad influence?


458
0:23:28,325 --> 0:23:30,869
Of course I'm a bad influence.


459
0:23:30,869 --> 0:23:32,83
Let's see if we can
commandeer this vessel...


460
0:23:32,83 --> 0:23:35,165
'cause we're, uh, officers
of the U.S. Government.


461
0:23:35,165 --> 0:23:47,928
Not for long, we won't be.


462
0:23:47,928 --> 0:23:50,305
One day, we'll take a trip
on a boat like that.


463
0:23:50,305 --> 0:23:51,765
Would you like that?


464
0:23:51,765 --> 0:23:55,978
We'll be dressing for cocktails
and walk into the grandsalon.


465
0:23:55,978 --> 0:23:57,646
No one's talking about war.


466
0:23:57,646 --> 0:24:0,23
They're just dancing
to Cole Porter.


467
0:24:0,23 --> 0:24:6,989
- I'll have to get a tux.
- Yeah.


468
0:24:6,989 --> 0:24:9,825
Come on. There you go.
All aboard.


469
0:24:9,825 --> 0:24:11,952
- You're out of your mind.
- Oh, yeah.


470
0:24:11,952 --> 0:24:14,621
Careful now.
Here, sit down.


471
0:24:14,621 --> 0:24:18,792
Now let's see here.


472
0:24:18,792 --> 0:24:23,797
Ah! There we go.


473
0:24:23,797 --> 0:24:26,967
See, this is as close as I
could get you to your ship.


474
0:24:26,967 --> 0:24:30,679
So, at least I tried, right?


475
0:24:30,679 --> 0:24:33,14
Actually, you know what?
This is better.


476
0:24:33,14 --> 0:24:35,17
Yeah, it is.


477
0:24:35,17 --> 0:24:56,163
God, you're pretty.


478
0:24:56,163 --> 0:25:1,168
What's gonna become
of us all, Rafe?


479
0:25:1,168 --> 0:25:6,48
Well, the future's not
exactly in our hands, is it?


480
0:25:6,48 --> 0:25:18,936
No. I guess you're right.


481
0:25:18,936 --> 0:25:20,437
- Aah!
- Aah!


482
0:25:20,437 --> 0:25:23,106
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?


483
0:25:23,106 --> 0:25:24,399
Yeah, are you?


484
0:25:24,399 --> 0:25:33,242
That was not part of the date.


485
0:25:33,242 --> 0:25:34,451
Watch your step.


486
0:25:34,451 --> 0:25:37,12
Oh, thank you.


487
0:25:37,12 --> 0:25:38,497
Evelyn!


488
0:25:38,497 --> 0:25:41,25
Guys, come up! Come on up!


489
0:25:41,25 --> 0:25:44,127
Come up! We're in 321.


490
0:25:44,127 --> 0:25:46,129
There's something
I got to tell you.


491
0:25:46,129 --> 0:25:48,382
Well, you got no secrets
from me, Lieutenant.


492
0:25:48,382 --> 0:25:50,8
I've seen your medical chart.


493
0:25:50,8 --> 0:25:57,432
Here we go.


494
0:25:57,432 --> 0:26:0,769
This can't be good, or it
wouldn't be so hard to say.


495
0:26:0,769 --> 0:26:2,437
Yep.


496
0:26:2,437 --> 0:26:4,94
I got to go away.


497
0:26:4,94 --> 0:26:7,442
We're all going away.


498
0:26:7,442 --> 0:26:9,278
Yeah...


499
0:26:9,278 --> 0:26:14,116
but I'm going to the war...
tomorrow.


500
0:26:14,116 --> 0:26:15,993
I'm flying with
the Eagle Squadron.


501
0:26:15,993 --> 0:26:20,289
It's an outfit the British
started for American pilots.


502
0:26:20,289 --> 0:26:24,459
I don't understand.


503
0:26:24,459 --> 0:26:27,462
You're in the U.S. Army.
How could they order you to go?


504
0:26:27,462 --> 0:26:29,965
They didn't order me.


505
0:26:29,965 --> 0:26:34,511
I volunteered.


506
0:26:34,511 --> 0:26:37,14
Huh.


507
0:26:37,14 --> 0:26:39,308
But I passed you.


508
0:26:39,308 --> 0:26:42,6
I let you through.


509
0:26:42,6 --> 0:26:43,812
And now you volunteer...


510
0:26:43,812 --> 0:26:45,981
for the most dangerous place
you could go?


511
0:26:45,981 --> 0:26:49,985
It's not your responsibility,
not your choice.


512
0:26:49,985 --> 0:26:52,946
Flying's the only thing
I ever wanted to do.


513
0:26:52,946 --> 0:26:59,995
I mean, everything in my life
has led me up to this point.


514
0:26:59,995 --> 0:27:5,292
Meeting you.


515
0:27:5,292 --> 0:27:8,795
I love you.


516
0:27:8,795 --> 0:27:13,842
I love you so much.


517
0:27:13,842 --> 0:27:23,435
Let's go inside.


518
0:27:23,435 --> 0:27:25,812
All right. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.


519
0:27:25,812 --> 0:27:27,523
Just-I-I can't do this.


520
0:27:27,523 --> 0:27:31,276
This just-it's not right.
I'm sorry. I just-


521
0:27:31,276 --> 0:27:32,819
See, I can't do this.


522
0:27:32,819 --> 0:27:35,948
I mean, I mean, I can.
I- I want to.


523
0:27:35,948 --> 0:27:38,867
I'm not trying to be noble,
you know.


524
0:27:38,867 --> 0:27:41,119
Or not saying
I know what would happen...


525
0:27:41,119 --> 0:27:43,247
or just-
I need to stop talking.


526
0:27:43,247 --> 0:27:45,123
I just-I just don't want-


527
0:27:45,123 --> 0:27:46,917
I just don't want it
to be like everybody else.


528
0:27:46,917 --> 0:27:48,961
I don't want you to have
anything about tonight...


529
0:27:48,961 --> 0:27:50,838
that you regret.


530
0:27:50,838 --> 0:27:54,258
I mean, it's been the most
incredible night of my life...


531
0:27:54,258 --> 0:27:56,677
and I don't want to ruin that.


532
0:27:56,677 --> 0:28:0,18
Oh, you couldn't ruin it.


533
0:28:0,18 --> 0:28:7,437
If I had one more night to live,
I'd want to spend it with you.


534
0:28:7,437 --> 0:28:9,815
See, that's what I want
to come home to.


535
0:28:9,815 --> 0:28:13,235
That's what I want to have
to think about and dream about.


536
0:28:13,235 --> 0:28:15,904
I want to know that
the best part of my life...


537
0:28:15,904 --> 0:28:18,907
is still ahead of me.


538
0:28:18,907 --> 0:28:20,576
Look.


539
0:28:20,576 --> 0:28:26,456
Don't, um... could you...
not come see me off?


540
0:28:26,456 --> 0:28:33,13
Because, uh... saying good-bye
to you once is hard enough.


541
0:28:33,13 --> 0:28:37,926
Here.


542
0:28:37,926 --> 0:28:39,261
Take this.


543
0:28:39,261 --> 0:28:46,268
Why?
You think it looks good on me?


544
0:28:46,268 --> 0:29:24,848
I will come back.


545
0:29:24,848 --> 0:29:27,267
I thought you said
you told her not to come.


546
0:29:27,267 --> 0:29:28,602
Yeah, I did.


547
0:29:28,602 --> 0:29:30,312
Why you looking for her then?


548
0:29:30,312 --> 0:29:33,148
It's my test.


549
0:29:33,148 --> 0:29:35,317
If I tell her not to come,
and she comes anyway...


550
0:29:35,317 --> 0:29:37,694
then I-I know she loves me.


551
0:29:37,694 --> 0:29:44,618
All aboard! Track 57!


552
0:29:44,618 --> 0:29:47,621
If, uh, anything
happens to me...


553
0:29:47,621 --> 0:29:50,4
I want you to be the one
to tell her.


554
0:29:50,4 --> 0:29:51,625
All right?


555
0:29:51,625 --> 0:29:55,379
You just make sure and come back
for the both of us, all right?


556
0:29:55,379 --> 0:30:8,851
OK.


557
0:30:8,851 --> 0:30:10,644
See you when I get back.


558
0:30:10,644 --> 0:30:15,19
Yeah.


559
0:30:15,19 --> 0:30:40,549
Good hunting, Rafe.


560
0:30:40,549 --> 0:30:42,217
Evelyn!


561
0:30:42,217 --> 0:30:44,219
Evelyn!


562
0:30:44,219 --> 0:30:49,725
Evelyn!


563
0:30:49,725 --> 0:30:51,185
Evelyn!


564
0:30:51,185 --> 0:30:52,519
Evelyn.


565
0:30:52,519 --> 0:31:1,612
Hey!


566
0:31:1,612 --> 0:31:6,575
She loves me.


567
0:31:6,575 --> 0:31:8,118
The German Luftwaffe...


568
0:31:8,118 --> 0:31:11,33
relentlessly bombards
downtown London...


569
0:31:11,33 --> 0:31:13,332
while Churchill's
Royal Air Force...


570
0:31:13,332 --> 0:31:14,833
is in a deadly struggle...


571
0:31:14,833 --> 0:31:39,733
to maintain control
of the British skies.


572
0:31:39,733 --> 0:31:41,401
This is a real mess.


573
0:31:41,401 --> 0:31:47,407
Lieutenant McCawley
reporting for duty, sir.


574
0:31:47,407 --> 0:31:48,617
Good.


575
0:31:48,617 --> 0:31:51,453
We'll get you settled
into your quarters.


576
0:31:51,453 --> 0:31:54,79
And then introduce you
to the crate you'll be flying.


577
0:31:54,79 --> 0:31:58,293
If y'all are patching up
bullet holes here...


578
0:31:58,293 --> 0:31:59,586
maybe we ought
to skip housekeeping...


579
0:31:59,586 --> 0:32:0,963
and get me in an airplane.


580
0:32:0,963 --> 0:32:2,297
Two didn't come back, sir.


581
0:32:2,297 --> 0:32:10,848
We counted only eleven.


582
0:32:10,848 --> 0:32:12,933
Are all Yanks
as anxious as you...


583
0:32:12,933 --> 0:32:15,18
to get themselves killed,
Pilot Officer?


584
0:32:15,18 --> 0:32:24,152
Not anxious to die, sir.
Just anxious to matter.


585
0:32:24,152 --> 0:32:27,614
This is yours.


586
0:32:27,614 --> 0:32:29,158
Good chap.


587
0:32:29,158 --> 0:32:46,55
Didn't die till he'd landed
and shut down his engine.


588
0:32:46,55 --> 0:32:51,43
Please be seated, gentlemen.


589
0:32:51,43 --> 0:32:53,891
I'm afraid I'm in a bad mood.


590
0:32:53,891 --> 0:32:59,229
Churchill and Stalin are
asking me what I'm asking you.


591
0:32:59,229 --> 0:33:2,357
How long is America
going to pretend...


592
0:33:2,357 --> 0:33:4,151
the world is not at war?


593
0:33:4,151 --> 0:33:6,987
We've increased food and oil
shipments, Mr. President...


594
0:33:6,987 --> 0:33:8,363
and as far as I know-


595
0:33:8,363 --> 0:33:11,33
What they really need
are tanks, planes...


596
0:33:11,33 --> 0:33:12,826
bullets, bombs,
and men to fight.


597
0:33:12,826 --> 0:33:17,8
But our people think
Hitler and his Nazi thugs...


598
0:33:17,8 --> 0:33:19,208
are Europe's problem.


599
0:33:19,208 --> 0:33:22,753
We have to do more.


600
0:33:22,753 --> 0:33:25,339
Send the Brits and Russians
more of our ships...


601
0:33:25,339 --> 0:33:26,882
and anti-aircraft weapons.


602
0:33:26,882 --> 0:33:28,884
And keep cannibalizing
the Pacific Fleet?


603
0:33:28,884 --> 0:33:30,511
What choice do we have?


604
0:33:30,511 --> 0:34:44,42
We're building refrigerators
while our enemies build bombs.


605
0:34:44,42 --> 0:34:45,669
This is so exciting.


606
0:34:45,669 --> 0:34:48,172
You know there's about
one hundred ships on Pearl.


607
0:34:48,172 --> 0:34:49,673
How many sailors per ship?


608
0:34:49,673 --> 0:34:52,134
It depends.
More on a battleship than a sub.


609
0:34:52,134 --> 0:34:54,636
But say, on average... 2,000?


610
0:34:54,636 --> 0:34:57,973
Then there's the flyers,
the marines, base personnel.


611
0:34:57,973 --> 0:34:59,308
I'm still working on
the sailors.


612
0:34:59,308 --> 0:35:1,852
Girls, I think the odds
are in your favor.


613
0:35:1,852 --> 0:35:3,77
Yeah, like 4,000 to one.


614
0:35:3,77 --> 0:35:6,398
It's paradise.


615
0:35:6,398 --> 0:35:8,317
See you on the beach, boys!


616
0:35:8,317 --> 0:35:16,825
We're in Hawaii!


617
0:35:16,825 --> 0:35:18,702
Hey!


618
0:35:18,702 --> 0:35:21,288
You're not supposed
to paint titties...


619
0:35:21,288 --> 0:35:22,706
on the side of my airplanes.


620
0:35:22,706 --> 0:35:25,334
And if you do,
don't make 'em lopsided.


621
0:35:25,334 --> 0:35:26,543
They were lopsided, Earl.


622
0:35:26,543 --> 0:35:27,878
Look, it says right here.


623
0:35:27,878 --> 0:35:32,216
"Never ride waves amongst
rocks or submerged pilings. "


624
0:35:32,216 --> 0:35:34,9
See, it says
you shouldn't do that.


625
0:35:34,9 --> 0:35:37,54
How do you know they're
submerged if they're submerged?


626
0:35:37,54 --> 0:35:39,723
Gooz, what in the hell
are you doing?


627
0:35:39,723 --> 0:35:41,683
Just trying to fix
this surfboard thing.


628
0:35:41,683 --> 0:35:43,936
He keeps taking chunks off
his nose on the rocks.


629
0:35:43,936 --> 0:35:46,396
On my day off, I'm working
on my new invention-


630
0:35:46,396 --> 0:35:49,191
the Gooz Cruise Fin.


631
0:35:49,191 --> 0:35:50,692
I'm gonna be a rich fella.


632
0:35:50,692 --> 0:35:52,903
Every surfboard in
the nation's gonna need one.


633
0:35:52,903 --> 0:35:54,655
Yeah? Well,
you're gonna need a broom.


634
0:35:54,655 --> 0:35:59,493
Check out these new recruits.


635
0:35:59,493 --> 0:36:0,702
Hi.


636
0:36:0,702 --> 0:36:2,579
Aloha.


637
0:36:2,579 --> 0:36:5,4
Y'all pilots?


638
0:36:5,4 --> 0:36:7,209
We're working on it.


639
0:36:7,209 --> 0:36:10,42
It's a lot of switches
and stuff.


640
0:36:10,42 --> 0:36:14,216
Pride of the Pacific.


641
0:36:14,216 --> 0:36:16,718
Who are you?


642
0:36:16,718 --> 0:36:20,931
Terrors of the skies.


643
0:36:20,931 --> 0:36:22,14
Welcome, ladies.


644
0:36:22,14 --> 0:36:23,851
Hi.


645
0:36:23,851 --> 0:36:26,562
I have to deal with
toasty sun burnt fanny...


646
0:36:26,562 --> 0:36:28,772
before I can show you around.


647
0:36:28,772 --> 0:36:33,61
Ow!


648
0:36:33,61 --> 0:36:35,696
Dear Evelyn.


649
0:36:35,696 --> 0:36:38,407
It's different than I thought
it would be here.


650
0:36:38,407 --> 0:36:40,117
It's cold-


651
0:36:40,117 --> 0:36:45,122
so cold it goes deep
into your bones.


652
0:36:45,122 --> 0:36:48,167
There is one place
I can go to find warmth.


653
0:36:48,167 --> 0:36:50,544
That is to think of you.


654
0:36:50,544 --> 0:36:56,258
I just wish I could be
back there with you.


655
0:36:56,258 --> 0:36:58,76
It's not easy making friends.


656
0:36:58,76 --> 0:37:0,95
Two days ago, I had a beer...


657
0:37:0,95 --> 0:37:2,139
with a couple
of the RAF pilots.


658
0:37:2,139 --> 0:37:17,237
Yesterday,
both of them got killed.


659
0:37:17,237 --> 0:37:19,323
Dear Rafe.


660
0:37:19,323 --> 0:37:21,95
I miss you so much.


661
0:37:21,95 --> 0:37:27,164
It's so strange to be
half a world away from you.


662
0:37:27,164 --> 0:37:34,671
I'm right on his tail!


663
0:37:34,671 --> 0:37:37,466
Got one!


664
0:37:37,466 --> 0:37:40,511
Every night
I look at the sunset...


665
0:37:40,511 --> 0:37:43,972
and try to draw the last ounce
of heat from its long day...


666
0:37:43,972 --> 0:37:53,482
and send it
from my heart to yours.


667
0:37:53,482 --> 0:37:54,691
Family?


668
0:37:54,691 --> 0:37:57,945
Girl, sir.


669
0:37:57,945 --> 0:38:2,74
The girl.


670
0:38:2,74 --> 0:38:4,368
A lot of people
frown on the Yanks...


671
0:38:4,368 --> 0:38:6,78
for not being in this war yet.


672
0:38:6,78 --> 0:38:7,996
I'd just like to say...


673
0:38:7,996 --> 0:38:10,999
if there are many more
back home like you...


674
0:38:10,999 --> 0:38:19,967
God help anyone who goes
to war with America.


675
0:38:19,967 --> 0:38:21,927
Atten-hut!


676
0:38:21,927 --> 0:38:24,513
Attention on deck!
Admiral Kimmel...


677
0:38:24,513 --> 0:38:26,89
Commander-in-Chief,
Pacific Fleet, on deck.


678
0:38:26,89 --> 0:38:28,183
Sharp presentation, Captain.


679
0:38:28,183 --> 0:38:29,977
Thank you, Admiral Kimmel.


680
0:38:29,977 --> 0:38:32,855
For four months now Washington's
been blowing pink smoke...


681
0:38:32,855 --> 0:38:34,523
about the threat from Japan.


682
0:38:34,523 --> 0:38:36,108
Could make us lose
our fighting edge.


683
0:38:36,108 --> 0:38:44,533
I'm determined
not to let that happen.


684
0:38:44,533 --> 0:38:45,784
With your permission, Captain.


685
0:38:45,784 --> 0:38:52,916
Admiral, urgent,
from Washington.


686
0:38:52,916 --> 0:38:54,71
I'm supposed
to keep this fleet...


687
0:38:54,71 --> 0:38:56,545
battle-ready
to take on the Japanese...


688
0:38:56,545 --> 0:38:58,881
cover half the damn globe.


689
0:38:58,881 --> 0:39:0,465
Now they want me to transfer...


690
0:39:0,465 --> 0:39:1,967
another twelve destroyers
to the Atlantic.


691
0:39:1,967 --> 0:39:3,552
Don't they know what
we're facing out here?


692
0:39:3,552 --> 0:39:5,554
They feel Europe
is the greater danger.


693
0:39:5,554 --> 0:39:8,599
I'm assuming these risk
assessments include Hawaii?


694
0:39:8,599 --> 0:39:11,768
Pearl Harbor is too shallow
for an aerial torpedo attack.


695
0:39:11,768 --> 0:39:13,228
We're surrounded by sub nets.


696
0:39:13,228 --> 0:39:15,439
All we need worry
about is sabotage...


697
0:39:15,439 --> 0:39:17,107
so we bunched
our planes together...


698
0:39:17,107 --> 0:39:18,859
to make them easier to protect.


699
0:39:18,859 --> 0:39:21,28
Distance is our ally, Admiral.


700
0:39:21,28 --> 0:39:25,115
You analysts got it
all figured out, don't you?


701
0:39:25,115 --> 0:39:27,493
The smart enemy hits you...


702
0:39:27,493 --> 0:40:39,648
exactly where
you think you're safe.


703
0:40:39,648 --> 0:40:52,536
Incoming!


704
0:40:52,536 --> 0:40:54,955
I fixed the hydraulics
and electrics, sir...


705
0:40:54,955 --> 0:40:56,957
but the oil hoses
still need attention.


706
0:40:56,957 --> 0:40:58,167
Just crank it, Ian!


707
0:40:58,167 --> 0:41:8,844
God speed you, sir.


708
0:41:8,844 --> 0:41:10,179
Red section, take the bombers.


709
0:41:10,179 --> 0:41:12,764
Blue section,
look out for the fighters.


710
0:41:12,764 --> 0:41:14,558
Bombers dead ahead.


711
0:41:14,558 --> 0:41:19,771
Let's drop in
and give 'em a reception.


712
0:41:19,771 --> 0:41:22,191
Red Two, follow my lead,
high side.


713
0:41:22,191 --> 0:41:23,609
Go right at the lead bomber.


714
0:41:23,609 --> 0:41:32,826
Following you, Red One.


715
0:41:32,826 --> 0:41:38,957
Good hit! Good hit!


716
0:41:38,957 --> 0:41:43,545
Red One, coming around,
reset for the kill.


717
0:41:43,545 --> 0:41:49,51
I have the middle bomber.


718
0:41:49,51 --> 0:41:55,224
Hammer down!


719
0:41:55,224 --> 0:41:57,893
We got him.
Nice shot, Red Two.


720
0:41:57,893 --> 0:42:5,317
I got two M.E.s dead ahead.


721
0:42:5,317 --> 0:42:7,694
I'm on him.
I'm on his tail.


722
0:42:7,694 --> 0:42:11,448
Hammer down.


723
0:42:11,448 --> 0:42:24,92
I got one of them!


724
0:42:24,92 --> 0:42:26,255
I got another one.


725
0:42:26,255 --> 0:42:29,925
Red One, you got fighters
all over your tail!


726
0:42:29,925 --> 0:42:34,596
I'm under fire!
I'm taking fire!


727
0:42:34,596 --> 0:42:42,938
Red One, get out of there.
Pull up! Pull up!


728
0:42:42,938 --> 0:42:49,319
Argh! I got an oil leak.


729
0:42:49,319 --> 0:42:53,532
Can't see a damn thing!


730
0:42:53,532 --> 0:42:56,16
I can't bail!
My canopy's stuck!


731
0:42:56,16 --> 0:43:7,421
I can't bail out!


732
0:43:7,421 --> 0:43:12,801
He's on my tail, Red Two.


733
0:43:12,801 --> 0:43:22,811
I'm hit! I'm hit!


734
0:43:22,811 --> 0:43:29,526
Mayday! Mayday!


735
0:43:29,526 --> 0:43:45,501
Oh, my God.


736
0:43:45,501 --> 0:43:46,919
I'm no good at church.


737
0:43:46,919 --> 0:43:48,17
What do you mean, sweetie?


738
0:43:48,17 --> 0:43:51,673
When I'm up there getting
my slate wiped clean...


739
0:43:51,673 --> 0:43:54,593
I'm thinking how
to dirty it up again.


740
0:43:54,593 --> 0:43:55,802
Wow, this from a virgin!


741
0:43:55,802 --> 0:43:57,721
I got to inventory supplies.


742
0:43:57,721 --> 0:43:59,681
Kill me now.


743
0:43:59,681 --> 0:44:1,642
Could you be any more boring?


744
0:44:1,642 --> 0:44:4,19
Don't bother.
Sunday, she writes Rafe...


745
0:44:4,19 --> 0:44:7,731
ten pages instead
of the usual five.


746
0:44:7,731 --> 0:44:11,985
Gosh, I wish I was in love.


747
0:44:11,985 --> 0:44:15,72
Hey, sweetheart.


748
0:44:15,72 --> 0:44:17,533
She hates me.


749
0:44:17,533 --> 0:44:18,826
Good to see you, Red.


750
0:44:18,826 --> 0:44:21,37
Good to see you, too, Betty.


751
0:44:21,37 --> 0:44:22,913
You wanna come for a ride?


752
0:44:22,913 --> 0:44:24,414
Come on.


753
0:44:24,414 --> 0:44:38,554
Yeah, I'll be your chauffeur.


754
0:44:38,554 --> 0:44:39,972
That-a-boy! Be a mad dog!


755
0:44:39,972 --> 0:44:45,519
You hit pretty hard...
for a cook.


756
0:44:45,519 --> 0:44:47,771
All right, Walker,
who you got?


757
0:44:47,771 --> 0:44:49,565
I'll take the cook.


758
0:44:49,565 --> 0:44:53,735
Why? You don't like money?


759
0:44:53,735 --> 0:44:58,907
Come on! Get out there now!


760
0:44:58,907 --> 0:45:2,786
- I'll put five on it.
- Done.


761
0:45:2,786 --> 0:45:4,246
Against a mechanic?


762
0:45:4,246 --> 0:45:6,206
That guy craps rivets.


763
0:45:6,206 --> 0:45:7,541
How's it feel up
from the engine room?


764
0:45:7,541 --> 0:45:10,85
Sunlight botherin' you?


765
0:45:10,85 --> 0:45:12,754
Ow.


766
0:45:12,754 --> 0:45:15,632
Man, he's getting all busted up!


767
0:45:15,632 --> 0:45:18,552
Move! Move!


768
0:45:18,552 --> 0:45:20,137
Come here, we gotta talk.


769
0:45:20,137 --> 0:45:21,597
Get down here.


770
0:45:21,597 --> 0:45:22,89
He can't hurt us.


771
0:45:22,89 --> 0:45:25,17
He can hurt us.


772
0:45:25,17 --> 0:45:27,436
- He cut us. We bleeding.
- Bleeding?


773
0:45:27,436 --> 0:45:30,272
That's a scratch. See this?


774
0:45:30,272 --> 0:45:31,773
This is the hard-earned
greenbacks...


775
0:45:31,773 --> 0:45:34,318
of every pot-scrubbin'
chop in this fleet.


776
0:45:34,318 --> 0:45:35,861
Now if we don't win...


777
0:45:35,861 --> 0:45:38,197
Teeny here has to find
another battleship!


778
0:45:38,197 --> 0:45:40,532
I'm not going back
to the Arizona empty-handed.


779
0:45:40,532 --> 0:45:43,285
Don't worry about the money.


780
0:45:43,285 --> 0:45:46,622
I'll send that
smug engine-fixin' snipe...


781
0:45:46,622 --> 0:45:49,458
back below decks where he belong.


782
0:45:49,458 --> 0:45:51,168
We the man!


783
0:45:51,168 --> 0:46:2,346
He slapped your mama!
Be a son of a bitch!


784
0:46:2,346 --> 0:46:16,86
Look at this!
All right, Dorie!


785
0:46:16,86 --> 0:46:22,991
That's enough. That's enough.


786
0:46:22,991 --> 0:46:26,662
- Oh! Where's my money?
- Nah, fight's rigged.


787
0:46:26,662 --> 0:46:31,792
We're rich! Ha ha ha!


788
0:46:31,792 --> 0:46:33,1
How'd you get this?


789
0:46:33,1 --> 0:46:35,17
Boxing.


790
0:46:35,17 --> 0:46:36,797
Did you win?


791
0:46:36,797 --> 0:46:38,715
Yes, ma'am.


792
0:46:38,715 --> 0:46:42,636
What do you get for winning?


793
0:46:42,636 --> 0:46:49,17
Respect.


794
0:46:49,17 --> 0:46:53,605
So, why do you have to fight
with your fists to get respect?


795
0:46:53,605 --> 0:46:55,858
I left my momma in Texas...


796
0:46:55,858 --> 0:46:58,26
and joined the Navy
to see the world...


797
0:46:58,26 --> 0:47:0,195
become a man.


798
0:47:0,195 --> 0:47:3,31
They made me a cook.


799
0:47:3,31 --> 0:47:4,324
Not even that.


800
0:47:4,324 --> 0:47:7,494
I clean up after
other sailors eat.


801
0:47:7,494 --> 0:47:12,875
Two years, they never even
let me fire a weapon.


802
0:47:12,875 --> 0:47:16,837
Well, let's hope
you never have to.


803
0:47:16,837 --> 0:47:18,172
Yes, ma'am.


804
0:47:18,172 --> 0:47:20,9
You take care,
Petty Officer Miller.


805
0:47:20,9 --> 0:48:4,801
You, too, ma'am.


806
0:48:4,801 --> 0:48:8,18
You know,
he taught me to fly.


807
0:48:8,18 --> 0:48:10,974
I always knew that no matter
what trouble I got into...


808
0:48:10,974 --> 0:48:13,602
I'd never be in it alone.


809
0:48:13,602 --> 0:48:18,106
He'd be there with me.


810
0:48:18,106 --> 0:48:23,821
He was always pushing me
to be better and faster.


811
0:48:23,821 --> 0:48:27,783
He told me
you were a great flier.


812
0:48:27,783 --> 0:48:29,66
It was the same night
he told me...


813
0:48:29,66 --> 0:48:33,747
he'd volunteered
to go to England.


814
0:48:33,747 --> 0:48:36,708
Volunteered?


815
0:48:36,708 --> 0:48:45,217
He... he told me
he'd been assigned.


816
0:48:45,217 --> 0:48:51,932
He was always
trying to protect me.


817
0:48:51,932 --> 0:48:53,517
But you know what?


818
0:48:53,517 --> 0:48:56,311
I look at myself in
the mirror in this uniform...


819
0:48:56,311 --> 0:48:59,815
and I still
don't know who I am.


820
0:48:59,815 --> 0:49:3,152
I look like a hero...


821
0:49:3,152 --> 0:49:7,656
but I don't feel like it.


822
0:49:7,656 --> 0:49:10,993
Rafe...


823
0:49:10,993 --> 0:49:14,705
he always looked the part,
didn't he?


824
0:49:14,705 --> 0:49:39,938
He couldn't wait to be one.


825
0:49:39,938 --> 0:49:43,25
To Rafe McCawley.


826
0:49:43,25 --> 0:49:46,57
The best pilot...


827
0:49:46,57 --> 0:49:50,365
and the best friend
I ever knew...


828
0:49:50,365 --> 0:49:56,205
or ever will know.


829
0:49:56,205 --> 0:51:4,273
To Rafe.


830
0:51:4,273 --> 0:51:5,774
THUR Look at this.
The Japanese...


831
0:51:5,774 --> 0:51:7,943
are flooding the Pacific
with radio traffic.


832
0:51:7,943 --> 0:51:11,405
Everywhere from the Panama Canal
to southeast Asia.


833
0:51:11,405 --> 0:51:12,99
There's no logical pattern,
Captain.


834
0:51:12,99 --> 0:51:14,491
No. There's always logic.


835
0:51:14,491 --> 0:51:16,827
They know we read their mail.


836
0:51:16,827 --> 0:51:21,123
They're trying to make us think
their fleet is moving south.


837
0:51:21,123 --> 0:51:22,958
I'm not buying it.


838
0:51:22,958 --> 0:51:26,86
Something, something's up.


839
0:51:26,86 --> 0:51:44,354
Otherwise, why would they take
the trouble to bullshit me?


840
0:51:44,354 --> 0:51:48,942
Evelyn, I signed for
these letters for you today.


841
0:51:48,942 --> 0:51:51,445
They're from England.


842
0:51:51,445 --> 0:51:53,155
They're from Rafe.


843
0:51:53,155 --> 0:51:55,157
I'm sorry, Ev.


844
0:51:55,157 --> 0:52:11,507
You know how long
it takes mail to get here.


845
0:52:11,507 --> 0:52:12,716
Hurry up!


846
0:52:12,716 --> 0:52:17,679
Show time, boys! Come on!


847
0:52:17,679 --> 0:52:20,14
America still
awaits Japan's response...


848
0:52:20,14 --> 0:52:21,6
to peace proposals.


849
0:52:21,6 --> 0:52:24,144
Ambassador Nomura
arrives in Washington...


850
0:52:24,144 --> 0:52:25,813
in what could
hopefully guarantee...


851
0:52:25,813 --> 0:52:28,19
continued peace in the Pacific.


852
0:52:28,19 --> 0:52:30,651
On the British front,
Churchill declares...


853
0:52:30,651 --> 0:52:35,989
"Give us the tools,
and we will finish the job. "


854
0:52:35,989 --> 0:52:38,45
The RAF has fought
bravely against...


855
0:52:38,45 --> 0:52:43,372
Hitler's ambition to rule
the skies over the Channel.


856
0:52:43,372 --> 0:52:49,211
Victory does not come
without sacrifice.


857
0:52:49,211 --> 0:52:50,42
Evelyn!


858
0:52:50,42 --> 0:52:51,88
- Danny.
- Hey.


859
0:52:51,88 --> 0:52:54,883
Some comedy, huh?


860
0:52:54,883 --> 0:52:57,1
Yeah.


861
0:52:57,1 --> 0:52:59,54
It's been a while.


862
0:52:59,54 --> 0:53:1,682
I've been logging
a lot of flight hours.


863
0:53:1,682 --> 0:53:4,56
I kinda been avoiding you, too.


864
0:53:4,56 --> 0:53:6,395
Yeah.


865
0:53:6,395 --> 0:53:8,647
- Look-
- Do you-


866
0:53:8,647 --> 0:53:9,898
Do you want to?


867
0:53:9,898 --> 0:53:12,67
Sure, yeah.


868
0:53:12,67 --> 0:53:14,111
I remember
one time when I was...


869
0:53:14,111 --> 0:53:15,737
like, seven years old...


870
0:53:15,737 --> 0:53:18,198
I was always building
gadgets and things.


871
0:53:18,198 --> 0:53:20,325
He wanted me
to build him some wings...


872
0:53:20,325 --> 0:53:22,244
so he could fly like his daddy.


873
0:53:22,244 --> 0:53:25,414
I told him you can't fly
without some kind of engine.


874
0:53:25,414 --> 0:53:27,124
But he wouldn't listen.


875
0:53:27,124 --> 0:53:29,668
"Danny, never mind that,
just build 'em anyway. "


876
0:53:29,668 --> 0:53:31,92
So I did.


877
0:53:31,92 --> 0:53:33,63
And I'm up there...


878
0:53:33,63 --> 0:53:35,716
strapping these big ol' wings
on his back...


879
0:53:35,716 --> 0:53:37,593
that we made
from paper and glue...


880
0:53:37,593 --> 0:53:40,53
and these massive silk bloomers
that we stole.


881
0:53:40,53 --> 0:53:42,556
He looked so stupid,
and I told him...


882
0:53:42,556 --> 0:53:44,933
"You can't jump off the barn
in these. "


883
0:53:44,933 --> 0:53:46,727
And bam!


884
0:53:46,727 --> 0:53:54,526
He busted his leg on a backhoe.


885
0:53:54,526 --> 0:53:55,986
God, I miss him.


886
0:53:55,986 --> 0:53:59,198
Yeah. But don't you think...


887
0:53:59,198 --> 0:54:1,408
that Rafe wasn't
back up there next day.


888
0:54:1,408 --> 0:54:2,784
Cast and everything...


889
0:54:2,784 --> 0:54:6,622
telling me to make some
adjustments on those wings.


890
0:54:6,622 --> 0:54:8,165
Check this out!


891
0:54:8,165 --> 0:54:10,42
Crossroads of the Pacific.


892
0:54:10,42 --> 0:54:13,45
Tahiti-1,700 miles!


893
0:54:13,45 --> 0:54:15,297
All right!


894
0:54:15,297 --> 0:54:22,679
Say, Betty...


895
0:54:22,679 --> 0:54:26,475
W- wou...


896
0:54:26,475 --> 0:54:28,602
- No, Betty! Get up!
- What's going on, Red?


897
0:54:28,602 --> 0:54:31,563
- Stand up, please.
- What do you mean?


898
0:54:31,563 --> 0:54:33,482
Just stand up.


899
0:54:33,482 --> 0:54:35,526
Stand...


900
0:54:35,526 --> 0:54:38,28
Oh! Ha!


901
0:54:38,28 --> 0:54:39,696
Betty...


902
0:54:39,696 --> 0:54:40,906
Red, come on!


903
0:54:40,906 --> 0:54:45,327
We got a dinner reservation.


904
0:54:45,327 --> 0:54:48,956
Can I get a minute?


905
0:54:48,956 --> 0:54:52,125
What's the matter, you sick?


906
0:54:52,125 --> 0:54:55,587
Can a guy propose?!


907
0:54:55,587 --> 0:54:57,506
Oh! Thank you!


908
0:54:57,506 --> 0:54:59,383
Am I talking too much?


909
0:54:59,383 --> 0:55:4,96
Sometimes I do that, I'm sorry.


910
0:55:4,96 --> 0:55:5,347
Hold up!


911
0:55:5,347 --> 0:55:7,57
Look at this.


912
0:55:7,57 --> 0:55:8,684
Hello!


913
0:55:8,684 --> 0:55:11,27
OK, let's get out of here.


914
0:55:11,27 --> 0:55:15,149
OK.


915
0:55:15,149 --> 0:55:17,651
I guess I should go.


916
0:55:17,651 --> 0:55:20,404
Don't let it be three months
before I see you again.


917
0:55:20,404 --> 0:55:21,822
I had a good time.


918
0:55:21,822 --> 0:55:24,658
Yeah, me, too.


919
0:55:24,658 --> 0:55:26,535
Do you want me
to walk you home?


920
0:55:26,535 --> 0:55:28,203
No, I'll be fine.


921
0:55:28,203 --> 0:55:30,205
No... of course.


922
0:55:30,205 --> 0:55:44,303
- Good night.
- Good night.


923
0:55:44,303 --> 0:55:47,639
I was just wondering if maybe
I could come by some time...


924
0:55:47,639 --> 0:55:50,434
get a cup of coffee
or a piece of pie?


925
0:55:50,434 --> 0:55:54,438
What am I doing?


926
0:55:54,438 --> 0:55:59,485
OK.


927
0:55:59,485 --> 0:56:1,653
Oh! You were asleep. I'm sorry.


928
0:56:1,653 --> 0:56:3,447
Danny?


929
0:56:3,447 --> 0:56:4,781
Is something wrong?


930
0:56:4,781 --> 0:56:6,909
No! Nothing's wrong.
No problem. Hi!


931
0:56:6,909 --> 0:56:9,578
It's just Danny.


932
0:56:9,578 --> 0:56:11,58
I... just... you...


933
0:56:11,58 --> 0:56:13,749
you forgot this.


934
0:56:13,749 --> 0:56:18,3
Oh... thanks.


935
0:56:18,3 --> 0:56:19,922
It was good of you
to take the trouble...


936
0:56:19,922 --> 0:56:22,7
to drop it over... now.


937
0:56:22,7 --> 0:56:24,426
I... well, I thought
you might need it.


938
0:56:24,426 --> 0:56:27,387
You know...
maybe tomorrow morning.


939
0:56:27,387 --> 0:56:28,597
If...


940
0:56:28,597 --> 0:56:30,432
not that you wear this
to work, but...


941
0:56:30,432 --> 0:56:34,394
No... it's a hankie.


942
0:56:34,394 --> 0:56:39,441
Right, right. Yeah.


943
0:56:39,441 --> 0:56:44,404
Listen, I was thinking maybe...
I could come by some time...


944
0:56:44,404 --> 0:56:48,826
if I gave you a call,
could I come by?


945
0:56:48,826 --> 0:56:53,38
Once, maybe...
if you're not busy?


946
0:56:53,38 --> 0:56:54,289
Yeah, maybe.


947
0:56:54,289 --> 0:56:56,834
- Maybe?
- Maybe.


948
0:56:56,834 --> 0:56:58,126
OK, all right.


949
0:56:58,126 --> 0:57:0,87
Thanks.


950
0:57:0,87 --> 0:57:1,296
Good-bye. Good night.


951
0:57:1,296 --> 0:57:8,22
You are such an idiot!


952
0:57:8,22 --> 0:57:10,639
Did you have fun last night?


953
0:57:10,639 --> 0:57:12,14
It wasn't how it looked.


954
0:57:12,14 --> 0:57:14,59
And if it was,
it'd be all right.


955
0:57:14,59 --> 0:57:16,145
It's been months.
It's time to move on.


956
0:57:16,145 --> 0:57:17,98
I am moving on.


957
0:57:17,98 --> 0:57:19,565
Ev, don't lie.


958
0:57:19,565 --> 0:57:22,192
All I know is, I hear you crying
when you think I'm asleep.


959
0:57:22,192 --> 0:57:24,278
When my dad left...


960
0:57:24,278 --> 0:57:26,488
I was too much
for my mom to handle...


961
0:57:26,488 --> 0:57:28,49
so she sent me
to live with my aunt.


962
0:57:28,49 --> 0:57:30,576
I thought my life was over...


963
0:57:30,576 --> 0:57:33,162
But you don't know
where it's all gonna lead.


964
0:57:33,162 --> 0:57:35,497
If I hadn't run away
and lied about my age...


965
0:57:35,497 --> 0:57:36,832
and enlisted in the Navy...


966
0:57:36,832 --> 0:57:39,501
I wouldn't have met Red, and...


967
0:57:39,501 --> 0:57:43,338
now he's my fiance.


968
0:57:43,338 --> 0:57:45,674
Oh, God, I can't
get used to that word.


969
0:57:45,674 --> 0:57:47,843
- It's only been twelve hours.
- Oh, Betty!


970
0:57:47,843 --> 0:57:49,678
Little Betty
beat us all to the post.


971
0:57:49,678 --> 0:57:50,929
And this is ward three.


972
0:57:50,929 --> 0:57:53,515
As you can see, no patients.


973
0:57:53,515 --> 0:57:55,893
Welcome to Hawaii.
Come on, I'll show you the bar.


974
0:57:55,893 --> 0:57:58,61
Sandra, new recruits to torture.


975
0:57:58,61 --> 0:57:59,938
Come on. Excuse me, ladies?


976
0:57:59,938 --> 0:58:2,941
Hi!


977
0:58:2,941 --> 0:58:4,776
We're gonna wait two years
until I'm nineteen...


978
0:58:4,776 --> 0:58:8,447
and Red can buy me a ring.


979
0:58:8,447 --> 0:58:11,116
Rafe sent his best friend
to tell you...


980
0:58:11,116 --> 0:58:15,704
so you would be OK,
so you can move on.


981
0:58:15,704 --> 0:58:24,546
You gotta go on living, Ev.


982
0:58:24,546 --> 0:58:26,965
Red!


983
0:58:26,965 --> 0:58:45,15
Whoo! Sorry!


984
0:58:45,15 --> 0:58:49,78
Bye, Rafe.


985
0:58:49,78 --> 0:58:52,74
The Japanese Fleet is missing.


986
0:58:52,74 --> 0:58:55,35
They're operating
under radio silence.


987
0:58:55,35 --> 0:59:2,709
This footage was shot
four days ago on October 28th.


988
0:59:2,709 --> 0:59:5,671
We're sending
scout planes in wider vectors...


989
0:59:5,671 --> 0:59:8,173
all over the Pacific,
but they get nothing.


990
0:59:8,173 --> 0:59:10,425
They could be anywhere in here.


991
0:59:10,425 --> 0:59:13,595
I don't understand how
two whole carrier divisions...


992
0:59:13,595 --> 0:59:21,687
can just disappear.


993
0:59:21,687 --> 0:59:32,114
Clear!


994
0:59:32,114 --> 0:59:34,283
Aw, we're all over the page.


995
0:59:34,283 --> 0:59:36,16
We got one wall-eyed
and one pigeon-toed.


996
0:59:36,16 --> 0:59:38,912
Anthony, tap in number six.
All right.


997
0:59:38,912 --> 0:59:40,914
Gooz, tap in number three.


998
0:59:40,914 --> 0:59:42,249
All right.


999
0:59:42,249 --> 0:59:45,294
Hey. We got a visitor.


1000
0:59:45,294 --> 0:59:48,297
Oh... that ain't
no Navy issue uniform, eh?


1001
0:59:48,297 --> 0:59:50,132
Danny, it's Evelyn.


1002
0:59:50,132 --> 0:59:51,675
Jesus!


1003
0:59:51,675 --> 0:59:54,303
You alright?


1004
0:59:54,303 --> 0:59:56,305
Yeah. Yeah.


1005
0:59:56,305 --> 0:59:57,973
No.


1006
0:59:57,973 --> 1:0:0,517
I think I'm fallin' for her.


1007
1:0:0,517 --> 1:0:3,729
Wow. You know,
I saw this coming.


1008
1:0:3,729 --> 1:0:5,355
I didn't want this to happen.


1009
1:0:5,355 --> 1:0:7,483
It just kind of did.
Can't help it.


1010
1:0:7,483 --> 1:0:9,109
Well, Danny,
she's gotta be with somebody.


1011
1:0:9,109 --> 1:0:10,652
It might as well be you.


1012
1:0:10,652 --> 1:0:11,987
You telling me
if you were dead...


1013
1:0:11,987 --> 1:0:13,989
and you saw your best buddy
doin' your girl...


1014
1:0:13,989 --> 1:0:16,617
you wouldn't come back and beat
the living crap outta him?


1015
1:0:16,617 --> 1:0:19,119
- Tony, back off.
- I'd be back so fast.


1016
1:0:19,119 --> 1:0:21,872
Danny's being a better friend
taking care of her himself.


1017
1:0:21,872 --> 1:0:28,45
I got a girlfriend.


1018
1:0:28,45 --> 1:0:29,505
That's great.


1019
1:0:29,505 --> 1:0:31,882
Come on, fellas.
Let's split.


1020
1:0:31,882 --> 1:0:35,219
Danny, whatever happens now
is just about you and her.


1021
1:0:35,219 --> 1:0:37,346
You gotta try
and forget about Rafe.


1022
1:0:37,346 --> 1:0:39,515
Be careful, alright?


1023
1:0:39,515 --> 1:0:42,684
Ladies... cloud the mind.


1024
1:0:42,684 --> 1:0:46,73
- Thanks, Gooz.
- You're welcome.


1025
1:0:46,73 --> 1:0:51,26
Hey, Danny.


1026
1:0:51,26 --> 1:0:54,822
Where's everybody going?


1027
1:0:54,822 --> 1:0:56,782
Just bein' discreet.


1028
1:0:56,782 --> 1:0:58,7
Does it seem like everybody's
acting a little strange?


1029
1:0:58,7 --> 1:1:0,536
No. Nah.


1030
1:1:0,536 --> 1:1:4,289
Right.


1031
1:1:4,289 --> 1:1:6,708
Well, maybe-maybe a little.
Yeah.


1032
1:1:6,708 --> 1:1:8,752
Well, people in this outfit...


1033
1:1:8,752 --> 1:1:10,921
have way too much time
on their hands.


1034
1:1:10,921 --> 1:1:12,297
Oh, yeah.


1035
1:1:12,297 --> 1:1:13,59
I just hope they don't think
there's been something...


1036
1:1:13,59 --> 1:1:15,8
goin' on between us,
that's all.


1037
1:1:15,8 --> 1:1:17,469
Oh, no. I mean, no.
That would be...


1038
1:1:17,469 --> 1:1:18,887
embarrassing, right?


1039
1:1:18,887 --> 1:1:20,514
Forgot my wrenches.


1040
1:1:20,514 --> 1:1:22,99
That would definitely
be embarrassing.


1041
1:1:22,99 --> 1:1:23,517
Yeah.


1042
1:1:23,517 --> 1:1:25,769
Ha. Forgot my wrenches.


1043
1:1:25,769 --> 1:1:28,981
Hey. He really
doesn't have to leave.


1044
1:1:28,981 --> 1:1:30,566
No.


1045
1:1:30,566 --> 1:1:34,57
I, uh, I'm just goin'
out with the girls, so...


1046
1:1:34,57 --> 1:1:37,489
I guess I'll see you later.


1047
1:1:37,489 --> 1:1:39,783
- Yeah.
- All right.


1048
1:1:39,783 --> 1:1:42,953
Yeah, all right.
I'll see you around.


1049
1:1:42,953 --> 1:1:45,164
Shit.


1050
1:1:45,164 --> 1:1:47,332
Evelyn.


1051
1:1:47,332 --> 1:1:49,459
Have you ever seen
Pearl Harbor at sunset?


1052
1:1:49,459 --> 1:1:51,42
Of course.


1053
1:1:51,42 --> 1:1:57,759
Well... from the air?


1054
1:1:57,759 --> 1:2:0,637
You know, I could get kicked
out of the military for this.


1055
1:2:0,637 --> 1:2:22,493
- Really?
- Yeah. Stay down.


1056
1:2:22,493 --> 1:2:24,995
The Hawaiians called
this harbor Wai Momi.


1057
1:2:24,995 --> 1:2:26,872
It means "water of pearls. "


1058
1:2:26,872 --> 1:2:28,582
It's so beautiful.


1059
1:2:28,582 --> 1:2:31,335
My dad took me up
a couple of times.


1060
1:2:31,335 --> 1:2:32,794
Just don't do what he did.


1061
1:2:32,794 --> 1:2:34,421
What do you call it
when you flip over?


1062
1:2:34,421 --> 1:2:35,631
A barrelroll?


1063
1:2:35,631 --> 1:2:36,965
Yeah.


1064
1:2:36,965 --> 1:2:39,301
I won't.


1065
1:2:39,301 --> 1:2:46,642
Aah!


1066
1:2:46,642 --> 1:2:49,686
- Oh!
- Ha ha ha ha!


1067
1:2:49,686 --> 1:2:52,481
- Oh, God.
- What do you think?


1068
1:2:52,481 --> 1:3:3,992
I like that.


1069
1:3:3,992 --> 1:3:5,41
Hey!


1070
1:3:5,41 --> 1:3:7,746
That plane was supposed
to be back here an hour ago!


1071
1:3:7,746 --> 1:3:49,288
Quick, hide
in the parachute hangar.


1072
1:3:49,288 --> 1:4:39,87
My heart is pounding.


1073
1:4:39,87 --> 1:4:41,298
Danny, last night...


1074
1:4:41,298 --> 1:4:45,26
No, that's terrible.


1075
1:4:45,26 --> 1:4:49,431
Danny, we need
to talk about this.


1076
1:4:49,431 --> 1:4:51,433
Sir. Evelyn!


1077
1:4:51,433 --> 1:4:55,27
- Danny.
- Hey. Hi.


1078
1:4:55,27 --> 1:4:58,44
Hi.


1079
1:4:58,44 --> 1:5:0,442
I didn't sleep a wink
last night.


1080
1:5:0,442 --> 1:5:2,986
I had to see you.


1081
1:5:2,986 --> 1:5:5,572
Last night was crazy,
I know, but...


1082
1:5:5,572 --> 1:5:9,952
I'm not sorry. Are you?


1083
1:5:9,952 --> 1:5:13,33
I don't know.


1084
1:5:13,33 --> 1:5:17,417
Danny, I had a wonderful
time last night. I-


1085
1:5:17,417 --> 1:5:19,44
It's just all too fast.


1086
1:5:19,44 --> 1:5:21,713
Listen, Evelyn, I was just down
at the beach this morning...


1087
1:5:21,713 --> 1:5:23,59
and I watched the sun rise...


1088
1:5:23,59 --> 1:5:25,634
and I knew that everything
was gonna be different.


1089
1:5:25,634 --> 1:5:29,304
That this was the start
of something new.


1090
1:5:29,304 --> 1:5:32,307
In this place, in this moment.


1091
1:5:32,307 --> 1:5:35,644
And I don't care what
anybody else says, you know?


1092
1:5:35,644 --> 1:5:40,149
How can I not feel this way?


1093
1:5:40,149 --> 1:5:44,862
I kinda like you.


1094
1:5:44,862 --> 1:5:51,285
Oh, you do?


1095
1:5:51,285 --> 1:5:56,915
You have your tie on crooked.


1096
1:5:56,915 --> 1:6:1,211
Everything's
gonna be all right, OK?


1097
1:6:1,211 --> 1:6:11,972
Everything's
gonna be all right.


1098
1:6:11,972 --> 1:6:17,561
Do you have any airtours going
through the valley of Oahu?


1099
1:6:17,561 --> 1:6:31,325
You do?


1100
1:6:31,325 --> 1:6:34,411
Aloha.
This is KGMB in Honolulu...


1101
1:6:34,411 --> 1:6:41,46
on another beautiful
fall day here in paradise.


1102
1:6:41,46 --> 1:6:45,964
We have enough information.


1103
1:6:45,964 --> 1:7:16,829
We are returning home.


1104
1:7:16,829 --> 1:7:18,8
Do you ever wonder...


1105
1:7:18,8 --> 1:7:20,958
if this war's
gonna catch up with us?


1106
1:7:20,958 --> 1:7:23,418
Nota whole lot.


1107
1:7:23,418 --> 1:7:29,508
Every moment we're not together,
you're up there training for it.


1108
1:7:29,508 --> 1:7:32,803
Yeah, well, I'm training
for moments like these...


1109
1:7:32,803 --> 1:7:34,471
'cause I have no idea...


1110
1:7:34,471 --> 1:7:37,99
how I'm gonna get this car
out of the sand.


1111
1:7:37,99 --> 1:7:38,642
Evelyn, can you please
come out of the bathroom?


1112
1:7:38,642 --> 1:7:40,727
You've been there for an hour.


1113
1:7:40,727 --> 1:7:45,691
Evelyn! What are you
trying to do, look like me?


1114
1:7:45,691 --> 1:7:47,651
Are you OK?


1115
1:7:47,651 --> 1:7:48,861
Yeah.


1116
1:7:48,861 --> 1:7:50,445
What's the matter?
No, you-


1117
1:7:50,445 --> 1:7:53,31
D'oy.


1118
1:7:53,31 --> 1:7:54,992
They call it the vacant sea.


1119
1:7:54,992 --> 1:7:57,35
None of the major sea lanes
go through it...


1120
1:7:57,35 --> 1:7:59,955
and you can bury the entire
land mass of Asia there...


1121
1:7:59,955 --> 1:8:1,915
and nobody would know.


1122
1:8:1,915 --> 1:8:5,127
From there,
they could attack anywhere.


1123
1:8:5,127 --> 1:8:6,628
Our last signals intercept...


1124
1:8:6,628 --> 1:8:9,423
indicate that the Japanese
taskforce is heading south...


1125
1:8:9,423 --> 1:8:11,3
towards the Philippines
or southeast Asia.


1126
1:8:11,3 --> 1:8:13,635
But Captain Thurman
of Naval intelligence here...


1127
1:8:13,635 --> 1:8:16,638
has his own theory
about the missing ships.


1128
1:8:16,638 --> 1:8:19,141
Sir, I believe
they'll try to hit us...


1129
1:8:19,141 --> 1:8:21,226
where it'll hurt us the most-
Pearl Harbor.


1130
1:8:21,226 --> 1:8:24,313
It's over 4,000 nautical miles
from Japan to Pearl.


1131
1:8:24,313 --> 1:8:28,65
That's a long distance
to steam a navy, Captain.


1132
1:8:28,65 --> 1:8:30,986
Your theory is based on what?


1133
1:8:30,986 --> 1:8:33,697
Well, it's what I would do.


1134
1:8:33,697 --> 1:8:36,658
That's not exactly
hard evidence, Captain Thurman.


1135
1:8:36,658 --> 1:8:38,16
Well, Admiral,
if I had hard evidence...


1136
1:8:38,16 --> 1:8:39,578
we'd already be at war.


1137
1:8:39,578 --> 1:8:41,33
Sir, we can read
their diplomatic codes...


1138
1:8:41,33 --> 1:8:42,706
faster than they can type them.


1139
1:8:42,706 --> 1:8:44,374
But Captain Thurman's
cryptology team...


1140
1:8:44,374 --> 1:8:46,21
is still trying
to crack the naval codes.


1141
1:8:46,21 --> 1:8:49,171
The intercepts have missing
words and garbled lines...


1142
1:8:49,171 --> 1:8:53,8
so to explain the decrypts,
we have to try to interpret...


1143
1:8:53,8 --> 1:8:54,176
what we think
they're trying to do.


1144
1:8:54,176 --> 1:8:57,346
Interpret?
You mean guess.


1145
1:8:57,346 --> 1:8:59,932
They use
their informed intuition, sir.


1146
1:8:59,932 --> 1:9:2,351
We guess.


1147
1:9:2,351 --> 1:9:3,852
It's like playing chess
in the dark.


1148
1:9:3,852 --> 1:9:6,563
Any rumor, troop movement,
ship movement...


1149
1:9:6,563 --> 1:9:8,899
spine-tingle, goose bump,
we pay attention to it.


1150
1:9:8,899 --> 1:9:10,859
When I was in
the Asiatic Fleet...


1151
1:9:10,859 --> 1:9:13,111
the locals used to try
to get outside of a problem...


1152
1:9:13,111 --> 1:9:14,571
to try to see the inside.


1153
1:9:14,571 --> 1:9:16,198
Well, I see a strike on Pearl.


1154
1:9:16,198 --> 1:9:17,866
It's the worst thing
that could happen.


1155
1:9:17,866 --> 1:9:19,34
A blow to Pearl
would devastate...


1156
1:9:19,34 --> 1:9:21,495
the Pacific Fleet's
ability to make war.


1157
1:9:21,495 --> 1:9:24,832
So, sir, you would have us
mobilize the entire fleet...


1158
1:9:24,832 --> 1:9:27,876
at the cost
of millions of dollars...


1159
1:9:27,876 --> 1:9:30,337
based on this spine-tingling
feeling of yours?


1160
1:9:30,337 --> 1:9:34,258
No, sir. My job is to gather
and interpret material.


1161
1:9:34,258 --> 1:9:36,51
Making difficult decisions...


1162
1:9:36,51 --> 1:9:38,53
based on
incomplete information...


1163
1:9:38,53 --> 1:9:40,889
from my limited
decoding ability...


1164
1:9:40,889 --> 1:9:43,392
is your job, sir.


1165
1:9:43,392 --> 1:9:45,894
Then break the damn naval code,
Captain...


1166
1:9:45,894 --> 1:9:47,729
so I can make a better decision.


1167
1:9:47,729 --> 1:10:7,875
Aye, sir. We are trying.


1168
1:10:7,875 --> 1:10:17,9
I wonder if we shouldn't put
the Pacific Fleet on full alert.


1169
1:10:17,9 --> 1:10:18,218
In case the optimism...


1170
1:10:18,218 --> 1:10:22,181
of the "Honolulu Advertiser"
proves unfounded, gentlemen...


1171
1:10:22,181 --> 1:10:23,515
what are General Short
and the Army...


1172
1:10:23,515 --> 1:10:25,35
going to do
about protecting my ships?


1173
1:10:25,35 --> 1:10:27,936
Within a ten-mile radius
of your harbor...


1174
1:10:27,936 --> 1:10:29,897
we have fighterplanes
here at Wheeler...


1175
1:10:29,897 --> 1:10:42,493
bombers at Hickam, and
a trainingstrip at Haleiwa.


1176
1:10:42,493 --> 1:10:44,36
We've recently established
a radar station here...


1177
1:10:44,36 --> 1:10:47,164
that can detect planes
125 miles out.


1178
1:10:47,164 --> 1:10:49,5
Which is a month old, Admiral,
and untested.


1179
1:10:49,5 --> 1:10:52,294
I've seen
these new radar screens, Major.


1180
1:10:52,294 --> 1:10:53,962
There's no way of telling
whether they're ours, theirs...


1181
1:10:53,962 --> 1:10:57,883
or a flock of damn birds.


1182
1:10:57,883 --> 1:10:59,551
I'm intercepting
a call from Tokyo...


1183
1:10:59,551 --> 1:11:1,72
to somewhere close by Pearl.


1184
1:11:1,72 --> 1:11:3,18
There's a call from Tokyo.


1185
1:11:3,18 --> 1:11:6,642
They say they don't know you.


1186
1:11:6,642 --> 1:11:15,234
Hello? Hai.


1187
1:11:15,234 --> 1:11:16,985
It's a local dentist.


1188
1:11:16,985 --> 1:11:19,78
He can see Pearl Harbor
from his office.


1189
1:11:19,78 --> 1:11:26,829
Are there many sailors around?


1190
1:11:26,829 --> 1:11:29,331
Uh, the dentist
says that the flatships...


1191
1:11:29,331 --> 1:11:31,166
are not in port.


1192
1:11:31,166 --> 1:11:33,919
They're talking about
the weather.


1193
1:11:33,919 --> 1:11:36,171
He doesn't seem to know
who he's talking to.


1194
1:11:36,171 --> 1:11:37,965
Hello?


1195
1:11:37,965 --> 1:11:40,175
Hello? Moshi moshi.


1196
1:11:40,175 --> 1:11:41,969
Hello?


1197
1:11:41,969 --> 1:11:46,598
That was a strange call.


1198
1:11:46,598 --> 1:11:49,81
Admiral,
may I speak to you in private?


1199
1:11:49,81 --> 1:11:51,436
Why would a spy use a phone?


1200
1:11:51,436 --> 1:11:53,147
They know we tap
all international lines.


1201
1:11:53,147 --> 1:11:55,399
Our listeners feel
it's probably not code talk.


1202
1:11:55,399 --> 1:11:57,151
It sounds like someone in Japan
is sneaking around...


1203
1:11:57,151 --> 1:11:59,361
asking a local citizen
the location of our carriers.


1204
1:11:59,361 --> 1:12:1,738
Well, that makes me feel
all warm inside.


1205
1:12:1,738 --> 1:12:4,616
Get the FBI on it immediately.


1206
1:12:4,616 --> 1:12:6,952
Have we found
the goddamn Japanese Fleet yet?


1207
1:12:6,952 --> 1:12:9,58
No, Admiral. The bases are
looking all over the Pacific.


1208
1:12:9,58 --> 1:12:11,54
So the entire fleet could be
rounding Diamond Head...


1209
1:12:11,54 --> 1:12:13,667
and we wouldn't know
a thing about it.


1210
1:12:13,667 --> 1:12:49,328
Get on it.


1211
1:12:49,328 --> 1:12:51,413
I'm alive.


1212
1:12:51,413 --> 1:13:30,577
This is the first
I could get word out.


1213
1:13:30,577 --> 1:13:34,456
Jepense qu'il est mort!


1214
1:13:34,456 --> 1:13:53,642
ll estencore en vie.


1215
1:13:53,642 --> 1:13:59,189
I told you I'd come back.


1216
1:13:59,189 --> 1:14:1,4
Here, sit down.
Sit down. Come here.


1217
1:14:1,4 --> 1:14:3,986
It's OK.


1218
1:14:3,986 --> 1:14:8,615
It's all right.


1219
1:14:8,615 --> 1:14:10,33
You're real.


1220
1:14:10,33 --> 1:14:13,328
Yeah.


1221
1:14:13,328 --> 1:14:14,997
I wished for this every day.


1222
1:14:14,997 --> 1:14:16,373
I know. Me, too.


1223
1:14:16,373 --> 1:14:19,42
Every second. So did I.


1224
1:14:19,42 --> 1:14:21,336
I thought you were dead.


1225
1:14:21,336 --> 1:14:23,255
They said you were shot down
in the sea.


1226
1:14:23,255 --> 1:14:25,465
Yeah, I was.


1227
1:14:25,465 --> 1:14:28,468
I was in the ocean.
It was so cold.


1228
1:14:28,468 --> 1:14:30,762
I missed you.


1229
1:14:30,762 --> 1:14:33,932
I got picked up
by a French fishing boat...


1230
1:14:33,932 --> 1:14:36,977
and I was in occupied France,
and I couldn't get word out.


1231
1:14:36,977 --> 1:14:39,354
And I'm just-I'll tell you
all about it, I promise.


1232
1:14:39,354 --> 1:14:41,231
But I'm fine. I'm OK.


1233
1:14:41,231 --> 1:14:42,816
And I'm here now.


1234
1:14:42,816 --> 1:14:44,151
Evelyn...


1235
1:14:44,151 --> 1:14:46,361
I just wanted to see you.


1236
1:14:46,361 --> 1:15:4,588
You're so beautiful.


1237
1:15:4,588 --> 1:15:10,26
I love you.


1238
1:15:10,26 --> 1:15:13,43
Hey, it's OK. It's OK.


1239
1:15:13,43 --> 1:15:16,558
Evelyn, Evelyn. I'm back.


1240
1:15:16,558 --> 1:15:21,63
It's OK. I won't leave you
again, I promise.


1241
1:15:21,63 --> 1:15:25,692
Rafe, you died.


1242
1:15:25,692 --> 1:15:27,486
And so did I.


1243
1:15:27,486 --> 1:15:32,574
I know, but I'm-I'm-
It's fine now. I'm back.


1244
1:15:32,574 --> 1:15:40,666
We're together.


1245
1:15:40,666 --> 1:15:43,126
I mean, we are together...


1246
1:15:43,126 --> 1:15:47,13
right?


1247
1:15:47,13 --> 1:15:52,719
I don't know where I am.


1248
1:15:52,719 --> 1:16:22,958
Rafe.


1249
1:16:22,958 --> 1:16:28,172
Rafe.


1250
1:16:28,172 --> 1:16:33,1
Stay away.


1251
1:16:33,1 --> 1:16:36,889
Rafe.


1252
1:16:36,889 --> 1:16:38,974
This is Radio Honolulu...


1253
1:16:38,974 --> 1:16:40,35
playing the sweetest music...


1254
1:16:40,35 --> 1:16:43,312
on the sweetest island
in the Pacific.


1255
1:16:43,312 --> 1:16:45,481
It's a beautiful
December 6th...


1256
1:16:45,481 --> 1:16:58,952
with beautiful music...


1257
1:16:58,952 --> 1:17:0,454
Raaaaafe!


1258
1:17:0,454 --> 1:17:2,581
Oh, Goddamnit.
There you go.


1259
1:17:2,581 --> 1:17:4,75
A real live ace!


1260
1:17:4,75 --> 1:17:6,1
Whoo!


1261
1:17:6,1 --> 1:17:8,754
An ace is only five.
I shot down six M.E.s.


1262
1:17:8,754 --> 1:17:11,465
And I got two smokers, too.
They don't count them.


1263
1:17:11,465 --> 1:17:13,967
Of course, I got shot down
myself before they could pin me.


1264
1:17:13,967 --> 1:17:15,969
So you got back
from behind enemy lines, huh?


1265
1:17:15,969 --> 1:17:18,305
What's that combat like?
Were you scared?


1266
1:17:18,305 --> 1:17:21,6
Hey! One at a time.


1267
1:17:21,6 --> 1:17:23,685
Well, them Luftwaffe boys
can fly pretty good.


1268
1:17:23,685 --> 1:17:25,354
It's not like,
you know, training.


1269
1:17:25,354 --> 1:17:30,567
They're, uh...


1270
1:17:30,567 --> 1:17:32,69
Danny.


1271
1:17:32,69 --> 1:17:33,946
You know, they're all about
tactics is what it is.


1272
1:17:33,946 --> 1:17:35,906
See, the Nazis, right,
they're faster than you are...


1273
1:17:35,906 --> 1:17:37,825
so they'll disappear and
they get up in the soup...


1274
1:17:37,825 --> 1:17:39,368
and they'll throw like
a roll or a hammerhead...


1275
1:17:39,368 --> 1:17:41,662
and they'll come around
on your high side...


1276
1:17:41,662 --> 1:17:49,795
shoot you from behind-
like some Americans will.


1277
1:17:49,795 --> 1:17:51,713
Hey...


1278
1:17:51,713 --> 1:17:54,258
Gooz, you're lookin'
at a real live ace.


1279
1:17:54,258 --> 1:17:56,677
Well, let me give you
the shirt off my back!


1280
1:17:56,677 --> 1:17:58,387
Whoo!


1281
1:17:58,387 --> 1:17:59,93
Aloha! There you go!


1282
1:17:59,93 --> 1:18:1,39
I'll take it from you.


1283
1:18:1,39 --> 1:18:3,433
I can see how y'all been
spending your time out here.


1284
1:18:3,433 --> 1:18:4,893
Hey, Rafe,
we gotta talk, all right?


1285
1:18:4,893 --> 1:18:9,398
I got nothin' to talk
about with you. Here.


1286
1:18:9,398 --> 1:18:12,25
Why don't you have a drink?


1287
1:18:12,25 --> 1:18:13,902
I'll make a toast.


1288
1:18:13,902 --> 1:18:16,28
To returning from the dead.


1289
1:18:16,28 --> 1:18:21,493
Wasn't all I expected,
but, well, that's life.


1290
1:18:21,493 --> 1:18:23,871
To my best friend
and loyal buddy Danny...


1291
1:18:23,871 --> 1:18:30,335
for keepin' up the war effort
back here at home.


1292
1:18:30,335 --> 1:18:33,38
Ahh.


1293
1:18:33,38 --> 1:18:34,59
You know, where I come from...


1294
1:18:34,59 --> 1:18:36,175
somebody makes a toast to you
and you don't drink...


1295
1:18:36,175 --> 1:18:37,718
that's sayin' something.


1296
1:18:37,718 --> 1:18:40,762
All right, Rafe.


1297
1:18:40,762 --> 1:18:43,432
That's how it's gonna be.


1298
1:18:43,432 --> 1:18:45,17
To you.


1299
1:18:45,17 --> 1:18:46,477
Hey, you guys need to spend
some time alone, I think.


1300
1:18:46,477 --> 1:18:48,604
Aw, hell, no, Red.
Come on.


1301
1:18:48,604 --> 1:18:51,273
No, no, no.
We're celebratin' here.


1302
1:18:51,273 --> 1:18:53,4
Me over there fightin'...


1303
1:18:53,4 --> 1:18:55,486
almost gettin' killed...


1304
1:18:55,486 --> 1:18:57,362
my friend Danny back here...


1305
1:18:57,362 --> 1:18:59,573
lookin' after my interests
for me.


1306
1:18:59,573 --> 1:19:0,741
Y'all know Danny
was even good enough...


1307
1:19:0,741 --> 1:19:3,285
to look out for my girl for me
while I was gone?


1308
1:19:3,285 --> 1:19:6,79
We thought you were dead, Rafe.
And it gutted us both.


1309
1:19:6,79 --> 1:19:8,874
And we were just tryin'
to get on with our lives.


1310
1:19:8,874 --> 1:19:10,501
Life is good, ain't it, Danny?


1311
1:19:10,501 --> 1:19:12,711
You know, you're a rotten drunk.
You always have been.


1312
1:19:12,711 --> 1:19:17,633
Well, you're a lousy friend.
That's a new development.


1313
1:19:17,633 --> 1:19:20,26
You left her to fight
somebody else's war...


1314
1:19:20,26 --> 1:19:21,97
and you made damn sure
that I didn't go with you...


1315
1:19:21,97 --> 1:19:23,555
and we thought
that you were dead-


1316
1:19:23,555 --> 1:19:25,766
I almost did die,
you little son of a bitch!


1317
1:19:25,766 --> 1:19:28,227
And her face was the last thing
that went through my mind...


1318
1:19:28,227 --> 1:19:30,27
so don't stand there and tell
me to act like it's all right!


1319
1:19:30,27 --> 1:19:32,481
Yeah, Rafe, well, I stayed.


1320
1:19:32,481 --> 1:19:34,483
I stayed,
and you made sure of that...


1321
1:19:34,483 --> 1:19:35,776
and some things changed.


1322
1:19:35,776 --> 1:19:37,653
And I hope
you can get used to that.


1323
1:19:37,653 --> 1:19:39,655
Oh, I have to get used to it?


1324
1:19:39,655 --> 1:19:43,2
All right. We'll see
how I can get used to it.


1325
1:19:43,2 --> 1:19:45,35
- Whoa!
- Hey!


1326
1:19:45,35 --> 1:19:46,411
Get used to that, boy!


1327
1:19:46,411 --> 1:19:47,996
Hey, hey!


1328
1:19:47,996 --> 1:19:49,248
And that's my left hand, too!


1329
1:19:49,248 --> 1:19:56,296
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, come on!


1330
1:19:56,296 --> 1:19:59,383
Melee at the Hula-la.
Send M.P.s!


1331
1:19:59,383 --> 1:20:2,261
- Aah!
- Aah!


1332
1:20:2,261 --> 1:20:5,13
- You called me a lousy friend?
- Get your hands off!


1333
1:20:5,13 --> 1:20:7,724
Aah!


1334
1:20:7,724 --> 1:20:10,811
Ow! Shit!


1335
1:20:10,811 --> 1:20:17,776
Come on, Danny!


1336
1:20:17,776 --> 1:20:20,32
Let's go get 'em.


1337
1:20:20,32 --> 1:20:23,699
Let's move out!


1338
1:20:23,699 --> 1:20:26,118
Oh, no. They're gonna
throw us in the brig.


1339
1:20:26,118 --> 1:21:13,415
Let's get outta here.


1340
1:21:13,415 --> 1:21:17,461
Oh, shit.


1341
1:21:17,461 --> 1:21:19,296
Rafe...


1342
1:21:19,296 --> 1:21:21,298
you're the only family I got.


1343
1:21:21,298 --> 1:21:23,717
When you were gone...


1344
1:21:23,717 --> 1:21:25,969
it was the loneliest
I'd ever been.


1345
1:21:25,969 --> 1:21:28,96
The same for her, too.


1346
1:21:28,96 --> 1:21:30,641
Oh, boy, now you're really
breakin' my heart.


1347
1:21:30,641 --> 1:21:32,893
If you hadn't gone,
none of this woulda happened.


1348
1:21:32,893 --> 1:21:35,979
Oh, so it's my fault, I guess.


1349
1:21:35,979 --> 1:21:41,652
Damn it, Rafe.


1350
1:21:41,652 --> 1:21:45,155
I just know
there's got to be some way...


1351
1:21:45,155 --> 1:21:48,617
we can work things out
so that...


1352
1:21:48,617 --> 1:21:51,537
things could be right
between me and you.


1353
1:21:51,537 --> 1:22:2,714
I just don't see how
it could ever be the same.


1354
1:22:2,714 --> 1:22:8,178
Revered father...


1355
1:22:8,178 --> 1:22:13,16
I go now to fulfill my mission
and my destiny.


1356
1:22:13,16 --> 1:22:14,643
I hope it is a destiny...


1357
1:22:14,643 --> 1:22:16,979
that will bring honor
to our family...


1358
1:22:16,979 --> 1:22:19,481
and if it requires my life...


1359
1:22:19,481 --> 1:22:21,275
I will sacrifice it gladly...


1360
1:22:21,275 --> 1:23:44,817
to be a good servant
of our nation.


1361
1:23:44,817 --> 1:23:46,902
Hey...


1362
1:23:46,902 --> 1:23:51,323
we got a large haze.


1363
1:23:51,323 --> 1:23:57,704
That's too big
to be planes, right?


1364
1:23:57,704 --> 1:24:0,82
Is that what you wanna do?
Knight to knight five?


1365
1:24:0,82 --> 1:24:1,708
Boom! Wrong move.


1366
1:24:1,708 --> 1:24:3,669
Lieutenant,
radar's picking up...


1367
1:24:3,669 --> 1:24:5,712
a large return
moving in from the northeast.


1368
1:24:5,712 --> 1:24:7,589
Hang on.


1369
1:24:7,589 --> 1:24:9,216
Relax.


1370
1:24:9,216 --> 1:24:13,512
It's a flight of B-17s
coming in from the mainland.


1371
1:24:13,512 --> 1:24:15,347
Nothing to worry about.


1372
1:24:15,347 --> 1:24:19,226
A heck of a lot of B-17s.


1373
1:24:19,226 --> 1:24:23,939
Good shot, Hop.


1374
1:24:23,939 --> 1:24:27,568
This better be good, Commander.


1375
1:24:27,568 --> 1:24:29,82
One of our destroyers reports
having fired and sunk...


1376
1:24:29,82 --> 1:24:33,907
enemy submarine attempting
to enter Pearl Harbor at 0653.


1377
1:24:33,907 --> 1:24:35,75
It's 7:20!


1378
1:24:35,75 --> 1:24:36,577
We had decoder delays, Admiral.


1379
1:24:36,577 --> 1:24:42,332
Relay this to Washington.
Recall the staff.


1380
1:24:42,332 --> 1:24:44,126
"Failure...


1381
1:24:44,126 --> 1:24:45,752
"'Peace talks...


1382
1:24:45,752 --> 1:24:49,423
"useless. "


1383
1:24:49,423 --> 1:24:51,8
Thurman here.
Tokyo transmitting...


1384
1:24:51,8 --> 1:24:53,427
to their embassy
in Washington-


1385
1:24:53,427 --> 1:24:55,471
"Discontinue use
of your decoding machine...


1386
1:24:55,471 --> 1:24:57,14
"and dispose of immediately.


1387
1:24:57,14 --> 1:24:59,141
"Special emphasis
on destroying important parts. "


1388
1:24:59,141 --> 1:25:7,858
Do you read that?
Acknowledge.


1389
1:25:7,858 --> 1:25:9,193
Admiral...


1390
1:25:9,193 --> 1:25:10,694
Naval Intel intercepted
a transmission from Tokyo...


1391
1:25:10,694 --> 1:25:12,571
to the Japanese embassy
in Washington...


1392
1:25:12,571 --> 1:25:15,282
instructing them to break apart
all decoder machines...


1393
1:25:15,282 --> 1:25:17,367
and burn all secret documents.


1394
1:25:17,367 --> 1:25:20,329
The Japanese
are expecting a war.


1395
1:25:20,329 --> 1:26:9,2
Should we?


1396
1:26:9,2 --> 1:26:10,337
Warning of possible...


1397
1:26:10,337 --> 1:26:13,132
Japanese aggressive movement
in any direction.


1398
1:26:13,132 --> 1:26:15,759
"Broken relationship.
Hostilities imminent. "


1399
1:26:15,759 --> 1:26:56,383
But where?


1400
1:26:56,383 --> 1:27:0,262
Did you ever lose a fight,
Miller?


1401
1:27:0,262 --> 1:27:2,639
I been lucky so far, Captain.


1402
1:27:2,639 --> 1:27:5,934
From what I hear, it ain't luck.


1403
1:27:5,934 --> 1:27:19,198
Ship's proud of you, son.


1404
1:27:19,198 --> 1:27:42,95
Ha ha ha. Yeah! Ha ha!


1405
1:27:42,95 --> 1:27:44,139
Why the hell's the Navy...


1406
1:27:44,139 --> 1:28:40,904
doing practice this early
on a Sunday?


1407
1:28:40,904 --> 1:28:49,371
- Aah!
- Get down!


1408
1:28:49,371 --> 1:28:52,958
Go, go, go, go!


1409
1:28:52,958 --> 1:28:55,169
I'm with Navy newsreel,
and I can tell you one thing-


1410
1:28:55,169 --> 1:29:1,91
them ain't Navy planes!


1411
1:29:1,91 --> 1:29:2,718
All hands,
man your battle stations!


1412
1:29:2,718 --> 1:29:4,261
We're being bombed!
We're being bombed!


1413
1:29:4,261 --> 1:29:17,524
Get up! Get up!


1414
1:29:17,524 --> 1:29:29,161
Jesus Christ!


1415
1:29:29,161 --> 1:29:30,329
Man your battle stations.


1416
1:29:30,329 --> 1:29:48,889
Another dumb drill.


1417
1:29:48,889 --> 1:29:50,516
All hands,
man your battle stations.


1418
1:29:50,516 --> 1:29:55,187
- What the heck was that?
- It's a bomb!


1419
1:29:55,187 --> 1:30:1,235
Move, move, move!


1420
1:30:1,235 --> 1:30:8,45
Son of a bi-


1421
1:30:8,45 --> 1:30:10,744
From outside!


1422
1:30:10,744 --> 1:30:15,82
Get me the engine room!


1423
1:30:15,82 --> 1:30:16,834
My God.


1424
1:30:16,834 --> 1:30:19,44
Take cover!


1425
1:30:19,44 --> 1:30:21,63
Down! Down!


1426
1:30:21,63 --> 1:30:24,8
Report battle stations!
Manned and ready!


1427
1:30:24,8 --> 1:30:26,385
Man your battle stations!


1428
1:30:26,385 --> 1:30:28,95
This is no shit!


1429
1:30:28,95 --> 1:30:29,721
They just sunk the Arizona!


1430
1:30:29,721 --> 1:30:31,14
General quarters!
General quarters!


1431
1:30:31,14 --> 1:30:33,142
All hands,
man your battle stations!


1432
1:30:33,142 --> 1:30:36,103
This is no damn drill!


1433
1:30:36,103 --> 1:30:40,399
Go! Go!


1434
1:30:40,399 --> 1:30:42,693
They look like Japs.


1435
1:30:42,693 --> 1:30:45,404
I didn't even know
the Japs were sore at us!


1436
1:30:45,404 --> 1:30:50,742
Danny, you just get me
to a goddamn airplane!


1437
1:30:50,742 --> 1:30:51,952
Holy God!


1438
1:30:51,952 --> 1:30:54,413
This is good
footage. Did you see that?


1439
1:30:54,413 --> 1:30:55,789
Holy cow!


1440
1:30:55,789 --> 1:31:37,164
I hope
there's still an airfield left.


1441
1:31:37,164 --> 1:31:41,919
Hurry up!
What in the world?


1442
1:31:41,919 --> 1:31:53,32
Look! So many!


1443
1:31:53,32 --> 1:32:8,464
Everybody to the hospital!


1444
1:32:8,464 --> 1:32:11,759
Why's the Navy
always buzzin' us?


1445
1:32:11,759 --> 1:32:15,346
shut up, Red!


1446
1:32:15,346 --> 1:32:18,265
- Oh, man, come on.
- Red, it's too early.


1447
1:32:18,265 --> 1:32:22,61
The Japs are here!


1448
1:32:22,61 --> 1:32:59,682
What the hell?
Let's go! Let's go!


1449
1:32:59,682 --> 1:33:9,9
- Get corpsmen to the bridge.
- Aye, Captain!


1450
1:33:9,9 --> 1:33:16,115
Repair says third deck
is flooding port side!


1451
1:33:16,115 --> 1:33:31,714
Yaah! Uhh!


1452
1:33:31,714 --> 1:33:33,215
Get up!


1453
1:33:33,215 --> 1:33:35,426
Get up, you cowards!
Get up there and fight!


1454
1:33:35,426 --> 1:33:40,556
Move it!


1455
1:33:40,556 --> 1:33:49,857
Take cover!


1456
1:33:49,857 --> 1:33:51,233
I got you, Captain.


1457
1:33:51,233 --> 1:33:52,735
You radio for air cover!


1458
1:33:52,735 --> 1:33:55,237
Initiate damage control!


1459
1:33:55,237 --> 1:33:58,275
Find my X.O.
Tell him to assume command.


1460
1:33:58,275 --> 1:33:59,533
And you make sure the gunners-


1461
1:33:59,533 --> 1:34:2,71
Everyone's where
they need to be, Captain.


1462
1:34:2,71 --> 1:34:7,875
You trained us well.


1463
1:34:7,875 --> 1:34:12,63
Captain...


1464
1:34:12,63 --> 1:34:42,76
Aah!


1465
1:34:42,76 --> 1:34:44,203
Go, go, go, go!


1466
1:34:44,203 --> 1:34:49,208
Let's go! Let's go!
Everybody move!


1467
1:34:49,208 --> 1:34:52,211
Get the ammo
for that fifty cal!


1468
1:34:52,211 --> 1:35:0,219
Get that fifty cal!


1469
1:35:0,219 --> 1:35:5,516
Let's go! We gotta get-


1470
1:35:5,516 --> 1:35:18,904
Come on, man, we gotta
get this thing loaded up!


1471
1:35:18,904 --> 1:35:23,701
- Aah!
- Aah!


1472
1:35:23,701 --> 1:35:28,122
Let's go! Let's go!


1473
1:35:28,122 --> 1:36:3,199
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!


1474
1:36:3,199 --> 1:36:5,785
Danny,
get me into a damn plane!


1475
1:36:5,785 --> 1:36:17,797
Come on!


1476
1:36:17,797 --> 1:36:21,92
Get some ammo up here!
We need some men on these guns!


1477
1:36:21,92 --> 1:36:23,969
Sir! The captain says
you're in charge, sir!


1478
1:36:23,969 --> 1:36:26,514
We need more ammo! Now!


1479
1:36:26,514 --> 1:36:31,811
Send up ammunition
for the five-inch guns!


1480
1:36:31,811 --> 1:36:33,27
Medic!


1481
1:36:33,27 --> 1:36:34,522
All of 'em, now!


1482
1:36:34,522 --> 1:36:36,649
Aah!


1483
1:36:36,649 --> 1:36:55,126
Aah!


1484
1:36:55,126 --> 1:37:1,549
Aah! Aah! Aah!


1485
1:37:1,549 --> 1:37:3,217
Come on!


1486
1:37:3,217 --> 1:37:6,137
Aah! Come on!


1487
1:37:6,137 --> 1:37:9,682
Come on, you sum 'bitch!


1488
1:37:9,682 --> 1:37:15,271
Aah!


1489
1:37:15,271 --> 1:37:16,745
Aah ha!


1490
1:37:16,745 --> 1:37:18,149
Oh, yeah!


1491
1:37:18,149 --> 1:37:24,53
I need a doctor!
Somebody help me!


1492
1:37:24,53 --> 1:37:27,443
Get to the supply room!


1493
1:37:27,443 --> 1:37:35,875
Get everything out!


1494
1:37:35,875 --> 1:37:41,756
- Aah!
- Planes incoming!


1495
1:37:41,756 --> 1:37:43,758
Cut 'em down!


1496
1:37:43,758 --> 1:37:53,58
Come on, come on!
Get 'em away from the windows!


1497
1:37:53,58 --> 1:37:59,19
The mattresses!
Get 'em against the wall!


1498
1:37:59,19 --> 1:38:8,657
Take cover!


1499
1:38:8,657 --> 1:38:10,91
Is everybody all right?


1500
1:38:10,91 --> 1:38:14,955
Can you stand? Can you stand?


1501
1:38:14,955 --> 1:38:16,332
Hold your fire!


1502
1:38:16,332 --> 1:38:19,919
Get to the gun! Hurry up!


1503
1:38:19,919 --> 1:38:24,924
Get down, Danny!


1504
1:38:24,924 --> 1:38:30,513
Aah!


1505
1:38:30,513 --> 1:38:32,807
- Earl!
- This is Walker!


1506
1:38:32,807 --> 1:38:35,226
We need to get those planes
fueled and loaded right now!


1507
1:38:35,226 --> 1:38:37,394
What's going on
out there? Huh?


1508
1:38:37,394 --> 1:38:38,896
Danny,
what the hell's that noise?


1509
1:38:38,896 --> 1:38:40,558
You guys doin' target practice
or something?


1510
1:38:40,558 --> 1:38:50,699
I think World War II
just started.


1511
1:38:50,699 --> 1:39:0,584
Go, go, go!


1512
1:39:0,584 --> 1:39:2,42
- Billy!
- Run!


1513
1:39:2,42 --> 1:39:5,714
- It's gonna blow!
- It's a dud.


1514
1:39:5,714 --> 1:39:17,268
It's a dud!


1515
1:39:17,268 --> 1:39:18,561
Come on, get down!


1516
1:39:18,561 --> 1:39:21,21
Danny!
Danny, are you all right?


1517
1:39:21,21 --> 1:39:22,231
I'm all right!


1518
1:39:22,231 --> 1:39:23,983
Come on, let's go!
Come on, let's go!


1519
1:39:23,983 --> 1:39:49,884
Gooz, come on, man!


1520
1:39:49,884 --> 1:40:1,2
We're sinking! We're sinking!


1521
1:40:1,2 --> 1:40:18,496
Stay together!
Close the hatches!


1522
1:40:18,496 --> 1:40:33,511
- I can't swim!
- Just hang on!


1523
1:40:33,511 --> 1:40:36,97
Let's move it now!


1524
1:40:36,97 --> 1:40:37,807
Joe! Go! Go!


1525
1:40:37,807 --> 1:40:39,934
We're gettin' outta here!
Get in the car!


1526
1:40:39,934 --> 1:40:41,268
Get in! Get in!


1527
1:40:41,268 --> 1:40:42,686
Come on, let's go! Go!


1528
1:40:42,686 --> 1:40:44,814
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!


1529
1:40:44,814 --> 1:40:47,399
Come on!


1530
1:40:47,399 --> 1:40:48,818
Where's this place we're goin'?


1531
1:40:48,818 --> 1:40:51,278
We got a small mechanic runway
about ten minutes away.


1532
1:40:51,278 --> 1:40:58,536
Hasn't been hit yet.


1533
1:40:58,536 --> 1:41:5,543
We got Zeros on our six!


1534
1:41:5,543 --> 1:41:33,446
Duck!


1535
1:41:33,446 --> 1:41:38,576
Help us!


1536
1:41:38,576 --> 1:42:1,766
Aah!


1537
1:42:1,766 --> 1:42:5,6
We're trapped.


1538
1:42:5,6 --> 1:42:19,95
Try it! Try the door!


1539
1:42:19,95 --> 1:42:34,34
Aah!


1540
1:42:34,34 --> 1:42:41,972
Oh, my God! I'm going under!


1541
1:42:41,972 --> 1:42:44,35
It's sucking me back!


1542
1:42:44,35 --> 1:43:0,699
The current's too strong!


1543
1:43:0,699 --> 1:43:10,0
They're shootin' at us!


1544
1:43:10,0 --> 1:43:42,324
I don't wanna die!
I don't wanna die!


1545
1:43:42,324 --> 1:43:44,201
This is it.


1546
1:43:44,201 --> 1:44:9,643
Get us out of here now!


1547
1:44:9,643 --> 1:44:11,604
How bad?


1548
1:44:11,604 --> 1:44:17,777
It's still not over, sir.


1549
1:44:17,777 --> 1:44:21,906
An entire fleet at anchor.


1550
1:44:21,906 --> 1:44:47,807
My God, my God...


1551
1:44:47,807 --> 1:44:53,813
Barbara, fill every syringe
you can find with morphine!


1552
1:44:53,813 --> 1:44:56,232
Fill up the kitchen!
Are you listening to me?


1553
1:44:56,232 --> 1:45:5,533
Fill up the kitchen!


1554
1:45:5,533 --> 1:45:14,959
Over there! Over there!


1555
1:45:14,959 --> 1:45:16,961
We got a bad neckwound here!


1556
1:45:16,961 --> 1:45:18,963
Surgery! Move!


1557
1:45:18,963 --> 1:45:21,674
Get him to surgery!
Oh, God.


1558
1:45:21,674 --> 1:45:23,426
In here!


1559
1:45:23,426 --> 1:45:26,262
He's still bleeding!
Another hemostat!


1560
1:45:26,262 --> 1:45:31,517
Hurry!
Give me a hemostat now!


1561
1:45:31,517 --> 1:45:35,438
Damn it, hurry!


1562
1:45:35,438 --> 1:45:39,316
Gimme another hemostat!
Another suture! Hurry!


1563
1:45:39,316 --> 1:45:47,45
Give me a-
Oh, God, I'm so sorry!


1564
1:45:47,45 --> 1:45:49,34
Doctor!


1565
1:45:49,34 --> 1:45:58,335
Here! Aah!


1566
1:45:58,335 --> 1:46:1,46
Am I gonna die?


1567
1:46:1,46 --> 1:46:7,928
Nurse!


1568
1:46:7,928 --> 1:46:9,555
Don't leave me!


1569
1:46:9,555 --> 1:46:14,351
Doctor! Get over here!


1570
1:46:14,351 --> 1:46:16,896
My fingers
are plugging his artery!


1571
1:46:16,896 --> 1:46:20,66
Doctor, what do you need?


1572
1:46:20,66 --> 1:46:22,485
Focus, look at me.
What do you need?


1573
1:46:22,485 --> 1:46:27,323
- Hemostat.
- Hemostat.


1574
1:46:27,323 --> 1:46:30,82
Here. All right, look at me.
You're going to be all right.


1575
1:46:30,82 --> 1:46:41,504
You're going to be all right.


1576
1:46:41,504 --> 1:46:42,922
I need more ammo!


1577
1:46:42,922 --> 1:46:45,251
I need more ammo, ladies!


1578
1:46:45,251 --> 1:46:47,551
I need more ammo!


1579
1:46:47,551 --> 1:46:50,221
Earl! We good to go?


1580
1:46:50,221 --> 1:46:51,972
- Mostly, but-
- Get down!


1581
1:46:51,972 --> 1:46:57,103
- Shit! Get cover!
- Jesus!


1582
1:46:57,103 --> 1:47:2,525
- Come on, you guys!
- Earl, get in here!


1583
1:47:2,525 --> 1:47:5,271
Sergeant!
We need more than a shotgun!


1584
1:47:5,271 --> 1:47:7,982
You got any other weapons
for coverfire?


1585
1:47:7,982 --> 1:47:9,698
Inside that ammo locker!


1586
1:47:9,698 --> 1:47:13,828
- Come on!
- Move it!


1587
1:47:13,828 --> 1:47:16,414
- Go! Go!
- Get the guns out!


1588
1:47:16,414 --> 1:47:18,29
You said the planes
are mostly ready, but...


1589
1:47:18,29 --> 1:47:19,834
but what?


1590
1:47:19,834 --> 1:47:20,96
She's down, she's broke,
she's shit.


1591
1:47:20,96 --> 1:47:22,42
I got four left.


1592
1:47:22,42 --> 1:47:24,88
One's good, two need ammo,
one needs fuel.


1593
1:47:24,88 --> 1:47:27,133
Fall out
and load up in the bunker!


1594
1:47:27,133 --> 1:47:28,551
Let's go! Get down!


1595
1:47:28,551 --> 1:47:31,464
- Move!
- Get ready to roll this thing!


1596
1:47:31,464 --> 1:47:34,14
Get down! Now!


1597
1:47:34,14 --> 1:47:38,262
Anthony, Red, you stay here
and man the fifty-caliber.


1598
1:47:38,262 --> 1:47:42,44
Gooz, get to the next bunker
and lay down some coverfire.


1599
1:47:42,44 --> 1:47:45,86
Planes.


1600
1:47:45,86 --> 1:47:48,195
Should we fire?


1601
1:47:48,195 --> 1:47:50,614
Stay down! God damn it!
Hold your fire!


1602
1:47:50,614 --> 1:47:52,359
Stay still! Nobody fire!


1603
1:47:52,359 --> 1:47:57,621
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.


1604
1:47:57,621 --> 1:48:0,166
They don't know we're here.


1605
1:48:0,166 --> 1:48:2,1
- Stay down.
- Fire?


1606
1:48:2,1 --> 1:48:4,754
No, God damn it,
stay down, stay still.


1607
1:48:4,754 --> 1:48:10,217
Don't fire.


1608
1:48:10,217 --> 1:48:20,478
Oh, God.


1609
1:48:20,478 --> 1:48:22,202
I don't see any ordnance.


1610
1:48:22,202 --> 1:48:23,898
I think they're going home.


1611
1:48:23,898 --> 1:48:26,776
No. They'll be back. We still
got planes on the ground.


1612
1:48:26,776 --> 1:48:28,861
Pilots, listen up.


1613
1:48:28,861 --> 1:48:31,72
Get all the speed
you can on the runway...


1614
1:48:31,72 --> 1:48:32,865
don't get on the stick
till the very end.


1615
1:48:32,865 --> 1:48:35,528
In the air, stay low
between the buildings.


1616
1:48:35,528 --> 1:48:37,203
You see any Zero
on your tail...


1617
1:48:37,203 --> 1:48:41,82
wipe him off, don't freeze.
Just keep moving.


1618
1:48:41,82 --> 1:48:45,628
Try to separate 'em,
take 'em out one by one.


1619
1:48:45,628 --> 1:48:48,547
P-40s can't outrun Zeros,
so don't try.


1620
1:48:48,547 --> 1:48:49,924
We have to outfly 'em.


1621
1:48:49,924 --> 1:48:51,967
We got high-level bombers!


1622
1:48:51,967 --> 1:48:53,219
They'll bust this hangar
wide open!


1623
1:48:53,219 --> 1:48:57,98
Grab the fifties! Let's move!


1624
1:48:57,98 --> 1:48:59,1
Move! Move!


1625
1:48:59,1 --> 1:49:4,271
Go, go, go!


1626
1:49:4,271 --> 1:49:6,107
Zeros!


1627
1:49:6,107 --> 1:49:17,868
Take cover! Take cover!


1628
1:49:17,868 --> 1:49:23,707
Take cover! Take cover!


1629
1:49:23,707 --> 1:49:32,133
Aah!


1630
1:49:32,133 --> 1:49:44,311
- Get down! Get down!
- Let's go! In the box!


1631
1:49:44,311 --> 1:49:52,153
Aah!


1632
1:49:52,153 --> 1:49:56,574
Danny!


1633
1:49:56,574 --> 1:49:58,284
Come on!


1634
1:49:58,284 --> 1:49:59,452
Come on, buddy!


1635
1:49:59,452 --> 1:50:10,4
Leave him, he's dead!
He's dead!


1636
1:50:10,4 --> 1:50:11,756
They're kicking our butt.


1637
1:50:11,756 --> 1:50:16,177
Get to the airplanes!
Go, go, go!


1638
1:50:16,177 --> 1:50:22,558
Run! Red, Anthony, let's go!


1639
1:50:22,558 --> 1:50:29,482
Come on, help me!
Goddamn belts!


1640
1:50:29,482 --> 1:50:38,866
Let's go! Come on!


1641
1:50:38,866 --> 1:50:40,367
Knock 'em dead.


1642
1:50:40,367 --> 1:50:43,662
Quick! Get in! Put this on!


1643
1:50:43,662 --> 1:50:54,256
They're coming around.
Bring 'em out! Let's go!


1644
1:50:54,256 --> 1:50:59,512
Red, get out of here,
God damn it! Go!


1645
1:50:59,512 --> 1:51:1,403
Come on, let's go.


1646
1:51:1,403 --> 1:51:3,349
Joe, get out the way!


1647
1:51:3,349 --> 1:51:7,228
I'm rollin'!


1648
1:51:7,228 --> 1:51:8,896
Clear! Go!


1649
1:51:8,896 --> 1:51:12,108
Oh, God. Planes!


1650
1:51:12,108 --> 1:51:15,986
Come on, help me!


1651
1:51:15,986 --> 1:51:29,291
Hey, Joe! You got three Zeros
behind you!


1652
1:51:29,291 --> 1:51:32,837
Turn! Turn!


1653
1:51:32,837 --> 1:51:36,549
Oh, God!


1654
1:51:36,549 --> 1:51:45,85
Aah!


1655
1:51:45,85 --> 1:51:46,976
Oh, shit.


1656
1:51:46,976 --> 1:51:49,228
What are you doing? Get going!


1657
1:51:49,228 --> 1:51:52,148
Danny, start that thing up
and get in the air.


1658
1:51:52,148 --> 1:51:53,858
I'm not much good without
a wing man. I need you!


1659
1:51:53,858 --> 1:51:56,694
I got you!


1660
1:51:56,694 --> 1:52:16,756
Let's do it!


1661
1:52:16,756 --> 1:52:33,898
It's real tight, Rafe!
Real tight!


1662
1:52:33,898 --> 1:52:36,81
Hey, Rafe, I'm not sure
we have enough runway!


1663
1:52:36,81 --> 1:52:38,319
Get your airspeed up
before you leave the dirt!


1664
1:52:38,319 --> 1:52:44,658
Don't freeze. Don't freeze.


1665
1:52:44,658 --> 1:52:47,369
I don't think
I'm gonna make it over!


1666
1:52:47,369 --> 1:52:58,214
Come on! Come on!


1667
1:52:58,214 --> 1:53:1,801
We did it! I'm up!


1668
1:53:1,801 --> 1:53:5,513
We got Zeros behind us!


1669
1:53:5,513 --> 1:53:11,519
How many you see back there?


1670
1:53:11,519 --> 1:53:18,943
We got five on our six!


1671
1:53:18,943 --> 1:53:29,537
Take it down to the deck, now!


1672
1:53:29,537 --> 1:53:32,248
We gotta split 'em up.


1673
1:53:32,248 --> 1:53:39,296
You take left, I'll take right.


1674
1:53:39,296 --> 1:53:42,168
Earl, get some guns
in that goddamn tower!


1675
1:53:42,168 --> 1:53:51,434
OK! Let's go! Into the truck!


1676
1:53:51,434 --> 1:54:9,577
Danny, I got three on my six.


1677
1:54:9,577 --> 1:54:14,457
Whoo!


1678
1:54:14,457 --> 1:54:17,293
Stop! Stop! Let's go!


1679
1:54:17,293 --> 1:54:20,337
Let's go! Move it!
Move it, Red!


1680
1:54:20,337 --> 1:54:23,758
- Let's go!
- Gimme the fifty!


1681
1:54:23,758 --> 1:54:30,181
Let's go! All right!


1682
1:54:30,181 --> 1:54:41,776
I still got
two behind me, Rafe.


1683
1:54:41,776 --> 1:54:46,72
Yaah!


1684
1:54:46,72 --> 1:54:52,78
Son of a bitch!


1685
1:54:52,78 --> 1:54:56,791
Whoa!


1686
1:54:56,791 --> 1:54:59,794
Earl, God damn it,
get some guns in that tower!


1687
1:54:59,794 --> 1:55:2,379
On the tower.
Going ten stories up.


1688
1:55:2,379 --> 1:55:12,389
It's a long son of a bitch.


1689
1:55:12,389 --> 1:55:22,817
Rafe, they're all over me!
I can't get them off me!


1690
1:55:22,817 --> 1:55:28,197
Danny,
I still got three on my tail!


1691
1:55:28,197 --> 1:55:29,824
Keep jinking it!
Don't let them get a handle!


1692
1:55:29,824 --> 1:55:32,827
I can't shake 'em!


1693
1:55:32,827 --> 1:55:35,538
God damn it.


1694
1:55:35,538 --> 1:55:38,124
Danny, let's play chicken
with these Jap suckers!


1695
1:55:38,124 --> 1:55:41,544
I'm with you.


1696
1:55:41,544 --> 1:55:47,258
Jesus!


1697
1:55:47,258 --> 1:55:51,512
- I'm coming right at you!
- Don't brake till I tell you.


1698
1:55:51,512 --> 1:55:53,722
Not yet! Not yet!


1699
1:55:53,722 --> 1:55:56,434
Come on!


1700
1:55:56,434 --> 1:56:2,148
Go left! Now!


1701
1:56:2,148 --> 1:56:5,234
- Whoo! We got 'em!
- Ha ha ha!


1702
1:56:5,234 --> 1:56:9,28
Set up over there!


1703
1:56:9,28 --> 1:56:10,906
Come on, load it!


1704
1:56:10,906 --> 1:56:14,285
We're on the tower.


1705
1:56:14,285 --> 1:56:16,996
I got one on my tail.
I'll bring him right by you.


1706
1:56:16,996 --> 1:56:24,17
He's comin' around!
Let's get this Jap sucker!


1707
1:56:24,17 --> 1:56:27,757
Hold your fire. Here he comes.


1708
1:56:27,757 --> 1:56:32,303
You better be cocked and locked
when I come by!


1709
1:56:32,303 --> 1:56:35,347
Hold your fire!


1710
1:56:35,347 --> 1:56:44,19
Fire!


1711
1:56:44,19 --> 1:56:46,227
Whoo! Good shootin', boys!


1712
1:56:46,227 --> 1:56:48,27
Nice shot, Earl!


1713
1:56:48,27 --> 1:56:49,522
Let's head over
to battleship row!


1714
1:56:49,522 --> 1:56:59,371
I'm with you!


1715
1:56:59,371 --> 1:57:3,209
Let's go do some business.


1716
1:57:3,209 --> 1:57:15,679
I'm going after 'em.


1717
1:57:15,679 --> 1:57:18,974
Rafe! I got him!


1718
1:57:18,974 --> 1:57:23,521
- P-40's!
- Yeah!


1719
1:57:23,521 --> 1:57:24,939
They're pulling
into the clouds!


1720
1:57:24,939 --> 1:57:34,115
We ain't gonna let these
sons of bitches get home!


1721
1:57:34,115 --> 1:57:46,71
How do you like someone
shooting back at you?


1722
1:57:46,71 --> 1:57:53,134
Oh, I'm on your ass now!


1723
1:57:53,134 --> 1:57:56,554
Yeah! I got one!


1724
1:57:56,554 --> 1:58:10,25
Come on!


1725
1:58:10,25 --> 1:58:19,91
God, come on!


1726
1:58:19,91 --> 1:58:29,17
Come on, stay in there!


1727
1:58:29,17 --> 1:58:34,341
Whoa!


1728
1:58:34,341 --> 1:59:23,808
I got you, you son of a bitch!


1729
1:59:23,808 --> 1:59:27,812
Who taught you how to fly,
Lieutenant?


1730
1:59:27,812 --> 1:59:35,82
He did.


1731
1:59:35,82 --> 1:59:38,732
I have to amputate here!
I have to amputate!


1732
1:59:38,732 --> 1:59:40,199
You're not gonna die!


1733
1:59:40,199 --> 1:59:41,951
I got you.
Hold onto this...


1734
1:59:41,951 --> 1:59:43,536
Sandra,
we're running out of morphine.


1735
1:59:43,536 --> 1:59:45,996
Find some way to mark 'em...


1736
1:59:45,996 --> 1:59:50,0
So we can keep track
of who's got morphine already.


1737
1:59:50,0 --> 1:59:51,961
Tell me about your ship.
What ship are you from?


1738
1:59:51,961 --> 1:59:58,843
It's not marking.
Have you got a marker?


1739
1:59:58,843 --> 2:0:1,818
Use my lipstick!
Put "M" for morphine.


1740
2:0:1,818 --> 2:0:6,267
- We need a tourniquet!
- Tourniquet!


1741
2:0:6,267 --> 2:0:13,607
Where are the clamps?


1742
2:0:13,607 --> 2:0:17,236
There's nothing left!


1743
2:0:17,236 --> 2:0:19,196
- Evelyn!
- Here, use this.


1744
2:0:19,196 --> 2:0:21,449
Go outside.
There's too many to help.


1745
2:0:21,449 --> 2:0:22,867
Sort them out.


1746
2:0:22,867 --> 2:0:25,161
Only those that can be saved
you bring in.


1747
2:0:25,161 --> 2:0:26,871
I can't...


1748
2:0:26,871 --> 2:0:28,748
No, please,
I need you to do it!


1749
2:0:28,748 --> 2:0:45,347
Go! Go!


1750
2:0:45,347 --> 2:0:57,485
Aah!


1751
2:0:57,485 --> 2:1:0,488
Don't look at anyone
without a mark!


1752
2:1:0,488 --> 2:1:2,239
I told you, stand back!


1753
2:1:2,239 --> 2:1:3,866
Keep 'em outside!


1754
2:1:3,866 --> 2:1:8,245
Come on! Let's go!


1755
2:1:8,245 --> 2:1:9,955
Wait here.


1756
2:1:9,955 --> 2:1:12,958
Don't touch me, you Jap!
Get your hands off me!


1757
2:1:12,958 --> 2:1:14,877
Get him into critical.


1758
2:1:14,877 --> 2:1:20,91
- Get him off me.
- Critical, frontward!


1759
2:1:20,91 --> 2:1:22,384
How bad am I?


1760
2:1:22,384 --> 2:1:24,22
You're gonna be just fine,
sweetheart.


1761
2:1:24,22 --> 2:1:26,549
- I don't wanna die.
- You're not gonna die.


1762
2:1:26,549 --> 2:1:28,641
I've got your hand.


1763
2:1:28,641 --> 2:1:30,553
Do you have enough morphine
to make him comfortable?


1764
2:1:30,553 --> 2:1:31,685
He won't make it.


1765
2:1:31,685 --> 2:1:32,937
Line the critical up!


1766
2:1:32,937 --> 2:1:34,849
Get him morphine.
Take him over there!


1767
2:1:34,849 --> 2:1:36,69
Burn victims by the tree!


1768
2:1:36,69 --> 2:1:38,943
I just found her!


1769
2:1:38,943 --> 2:1:40,834
I don't think she's breathing.


1770
2:1:40,834 --> 2:1:45,95
No, she's dead. Take her-


1771
2:1:45,95 --> 2:1:48,869
Oh, God.


1772
2:1:48,869 --> 2:1:52,706
Are you sure, Ev?
Check her again.


1773
2:1:52,706 --> 2:1:55,209
She's dead.
Take her over there!


1774
2:1:55,209 --> 2:1:57,2
But you've gotta be sure!


1775
2:1:57,2 --> 2:1:59,588
She's dead!
Go back to work, Sandra.


1776
2:1:59,588 --> 2:3:35,101
I don't know what to do!


1777
2:3:35,101 --> 2:3:36,811
Over here!


1778
2:3:36,811 --> 2:3:37,937
Admiral?


1779
2:3:37,937 --> 2:3:41,232
From Washington.


1780
2:3:41,232 --> 2:3:48,531
"Attack by Japan
considered imminent. "


1781
2:3:48,531 --> 2:4:48,466
They're only an hour late.


1782
2:4:48,466 --> 2:4:49,759
How can we help?


1783
2:4:49,759 --> 2:4:55,473
We need blood. Come on.


1784
2:4:55,473 --> 2:4:57,802
Remember, son,
hold on to your faith.


1785
2:4:57,802 --> 2:5:0,19
1,500 cartons over there.


1786
2:5:0,19 --> 2:5:2,188
"'Today you will be
with me in paradise...


1787
2:5:2,188 --> 2:5:3,647
"so fear not. "


1788
2:5:3,647 --> 2:5:5,775
Fear not, my son.


1789
2:5:5,775 --> 2:5:8,36
You are a man truly blessed.


1790
2:5:8,36 --> 2:5:11,197
You will die
in a state of grace.


1791
2:5:11,197 --> 2:5:15,201
Remember, pain is temporary,
but glory is forever.


1792
2:5:15,201 --> 2:5:17,203
Hold on to your faith, my son.


1793
2:5:17,203 --> 2:5:20,623
You'll be with God, the saints,
and the angels soon.


1794
2:5:20,623 --> 2:5:22,208
I absolve you of your sins...


1795
2:5:22,208 --> 2:5:26,247
in the name of the Father,
the Son, the Holy Spirit.


1796
2:5:26,247 --> 2:5:28,881
Innomine patris et fili,
et spiritus sancti.


1797
2:5:28,881 --> 2:5:37,98
Amen.


1798
2:5:37,98 --> 2:5:45,689
Go with God, my son.


1799
2:5:45,689 --> 2:5:48,109
We've got men trapped
everywhere in the harbor.


1800
2:5:48,109 --> 2:5:57,868
We need help
from anybody who can move.


1801
2:5:57,868 --> 2:5:59,662
There's somebody in here!


1802
2:5:59,662 --> 2:6:3,833
Get somebody down here!


1803
2:6:3,833 --> 2:6:10,84
They're cutting through!


1804
2:6:10,84 --> 2:6:14,3
I hear somebody!
Get some guys up here!


1805
2:6:14,3 --> 2:6:18,723
Pull!


1806
2:6:18,723 --> 2:6:21,892
Get us out!
It's filling with water!


1807
2:6:21,892 --> 2:6:26,272
Get an airline in here!


1808
2:6:26,272 --> 2:6:33,571
We need the air hose!
What can we do?


1809
2:6:33,571 --> 2:6:38,909
It won't cut any faster!


1810
2:6:38,909 --> 2:7:14,487
- Cut him out!
- Aah!


1811
2:7:14,487 --> 2:7:15,946
Yesterday...


1812
2:7:15,946 --> 2:7:21,535
December 7, 1941...


1813
2:7:21,535 --> 2:7:24,824
a date
which will live in infamy...


1814
2:7:24,824 --> 2:7:27,875
the United States of America...


1815
2:7:27,875 --> 2:7:31,87
was suddenly
and deliberately attacked...


1816
2:7:31,87 --> 2:7:38,94
by naval and air forces
of the empire of Japan.


1817
2:7:38,94 --> 2:7:39,345
It is obvious...


1818
2:7:39,345 --> 2:7:43,974
that planning the attack
began many weeks ago.


1819
2:7:43,974 --> 2:7:46,491
During the intervening time...


1820
2:7:46,491 --> 2:7:48,979
the Japanese government...


1821
2:7:48,979 --> 2:7:52,56
has deliberately sought to
deceive the United States...


1822
2:7:52,56 --> 2:7:54,693
by false statements...


1823
2:7:54,693 --> 2:7:59,532
and expressions of hope
for continued peace.


1824
2:7:59,532 --> 2:8:4,537
The attack yesterday
on the Hawaiian Islands...


1825
2:8:4,537 --> 2:8:9,708
has caused severe damage
to American military forces.


1826
2:8:9,708 --> 2:8:11,293
I regret to tell you...


1827
2:8:11,293 --> 2:8:16,715
that over 3,000 American lives
have been lost.


1828
2:8:16,715 --> 2:8:19,844
No matter how long
it may take us...


1829
2:8:19,844 --> 2:8:23,556
to overcome
this premeditated invasion...


1830
2:8:23,556 --> 2:8:27,852
the American people,
in their righteous might...


1831
2:8:27,852 --> 2:8:34,567
will win through
to absolute victory.


1832
2:8:34,567 --> 2:8:40,74
Because of this unprovoked,
dastardly attack by Japan...


1833
2:8:40,74 --> 2:8:50,108
I ask that the Congress
declare a state of war.


1834
2:8:50,108 --> 2:8:51,651
Is it true...


1835
2:8:51,651 --> 2:8:57,24
men are still trapped alive
inside the Arizona?


1836
2:8:57,24 --> 2:8:59,367
We can hear tapping
from inside the hull.


1837
2:8:59,367 --> 2:9:0,952
We're doing everything we can
to get to them...


1838
2:9:0,952 --> 2:9:9,419
but they're
forty feet below water.


1839
2:9:9,419 --> 2:9:12,686
We've been trained to think
that we're invincible.


1840
2:9:12,686 --> 2:9:15,967
And now our proudest ships
have been destroyed...


1841
2:9:15,967 --> 2:9:19,971
by an enemy
we considered inferior.


1842
2:9:19,971 --> 2:9:22,265
We're on the ropes, gentlemen.


1843
2:9:22,265 --> 2:9:26,269
That's exactly why
we have to strike back now.


1844
2:9:26,269 --> 2:9:29,147
We'll attack the Marshall
and Gilbert Islands, sir.


1845
2:9:29,147 --> 2:9:34,861
I mean hitting the heart of
Japan the way they have hit us.


1846
2:9:34,861 --> 2:9:36,904
Mr. President...


1847
2:9:36,904 --> 2:9:40,45
Pearl Harbor caught us unawares
because we didn't face facts.


1848
2:9:40,45 --> 2:9:43,453
This isn't a time
for ignoring them again.


1849
2:9:43,453 --> 2:9:46,914
We have long-range bombers,
but no place to launch them.


1850
2:9:46,914 --> 2:9:50,877
Midway is too far,
and Russia won't allow us...


1851
2:9:50,877 --> 2:9:53,463
to launch a raid from there.


1852
2:9:53,463 --> 2:9:54,589
Admiral?


1853
2:9:54,589 --> 2:9:56,48
Navy's planes are small.


1854
2:9:56,48 --> 2:9:58,9
They carry light loads
and have a short range.


1855
2:9:58,9 --> 2:10:1,339
We'd have to get them within
a few hundred miles of Japan.


1856
2:10:1,339 --> 2:10:4,509
We'd risk our carriers,
and if we lose them...


1857
2:10:4,509 --> 2:10:6,309
we'll have no shield
against invasion.


1858
2:10:6,309 --> 2:10:9,312
Does anyone in this room
think victory is possible...


1859
2:10:9,312 --> 2:10:11,22
without facing danger?


1860
2:10:11,22 --> 2:10:14,66
We are at war.
Of course there's a risk.


1861
2:10:14,66 --> 2:10:16,319
But consider the risk,
Mr. President.


1862
2:10:16,319 --> 2:10:19,197
If the Japanese
invade us right now...


1863
2:10:19,197 --> 2:10:24,494
they would reach Chicago
before we could stop them.


1864
2:10:24,494 --> 2:10:28,81
Gentlemen...


1865
2:10:28,81 --> 2:10:33,86
most of you did not know me
when I had the use of my legs.


1866
2:10:33,86 --> 2:10:36,881
I was strong and proud...
and arrogant.


1867
2:10:36,881 --> 2:10:40,676
Now I wonder,
every hour of my life...


1868
2:10:40,676 --> 2:10:44,639
why God put me into this chair.


1869
2:10:44,639 --> 2:10:48,136
But when I see defeat
in the eyes of my country men-


1870
2:10:48,136 --> 2:10:50,52
in your eyes, right now-


1871
2:10:50,52 --> 2:10:53,648
I start to think that
maybe he brought me down...


1872
2:10:53,648 --> 2:10:54,982
for times like these...


1873
2:10:54,982 --> 2:10:57,819
when we all need to be reminded
who we truly are-


1874
2:10:57,819 --> 2:11:0,988
that we will not
give up or give in.


1875
2:11:0,988 --> 2:11:2,532
Mr. President,
with all respect, sir...


1876
2:11:2,532 --> 2:11:20,425
what you're asking
can't be done.


1877
2:11:20,425 --> 2:11:22,879
- Mr. President!
- Get back, George!


1878
2:11:22,879 --> 2:11:36,441
Get back.


1879
2:11:36,441 --> 2:11:39,26
Do not tell me...


1880
2:11:39,26 --> 2:11:45,867
it can't be done.


1881
2:11:45,867 --> 2:11:48,911
Japan continues
its military conquest...


1882
2:11:48,911 --> 2:11:51,748
throughout the Pacific.


1883
2:11:51,748 --> 2:11:53,291
But, back home...


1884
2:11:53,291 --> 2:11:55,752
millions of American workers
band together...


1885
2:11:55,752 --> 2:12:3,176
bringing factories to life
to avenge Pearl Harbor.


1886
2:12:3,176 --> 2:12:6,12
Mr. President, we have an idea
how to bomb the Japanese.


1887
2:12:6,12 --> 2:12:8,8
Sir, it's risky...


1888
2:12:8,8 --> 2:12:11,934
but it's bold.


1889
2:12:11,934 --> 2:12:14,479
- Who are you?
- I, sir?


1890
2:12:14,479 --> 2:12:17,482
Captain Low, Mr. President.


1891
2:12:17,482 --> 2:12:19,776
He's a submariner.
He came up with this idea.


1892
2:12:19,776 --> 2:12:22,236
I like sub commanders.


1893
2:12:22,236 --> 2:12:26,491
They don't have time
for bullshit, and neither do I.


1894
2:12:26,491 --> 2:12:44,634
Fire away, gentlemen.


1895
2:12:44,634 --> 2:12:48,346
And where is God in all this?


1896
2:12:48,346 --> 2:12:53,226
Our enemies believe
a divine wind protects them.


1897
2:12:53,226 --> 2:13:18,835
But we see our friends
laid out here before us.


1898
2:13:18,835 --> 2:13:43,734
Hey, Captain.


1899
2:13:43,734 --> 2:13:45,445
Lieutenants Rafe McCawley,
Daniel Walker.


1900
2:13:45,445 --> 2:13:47,29
Yes, Major?


1901
2:13:47,29 --> 2:13:50,45
You're both going stateside.
Fly out in two hours.


1902
2:13:50,45 --> 2:13:51,743
What for, sir?


1903
2:13:51,743 --> 2:13:56,998
Ask Colonel Doolittle.


1904
2:13:56,998 --> 2:14:14,56
Yes, sir.


1905
2:14:14,56 --> 2:14:18,603
You're packing.


1906
2:14:18,603 --> 2:14:19,896
Orders.


1907
2:14:19,896 --> 2:14:22,648
What kind of orders?


1908
2:14:22,648 --> 2:14:26,319
The top-secret kind.


1909
2:14:26,319 --> 2:14:30,364
The dangerous kind.


1910
2:14:30,364 --> 2:14:32,75
I can't find Danny.


1911
2:14:32,75 --> 2:14:34,494
Is that why you're here?


1912
2:14:34,494 --> 2:14:37,205
Looking for Danny?


1913
2:14:37,205 --> 2:14:38,581
Probably saying good-bye
to his squadron.


1914
2:14:38,581 --> 2:14:49,55
We've been assigned
to Doolittle.


1915
2:14:49,55 --> 2:14:56,516
I wasn't looking for Danny.


1916
2:14:56,516 --> 2:14:58,101
I couldn't have you go away...


1917
2:14:58,101 --> 2:15:5,525
without you
understanding something.


1918
2:15:5,525 --> 2:15:7,819
Yeah. You don't have
to explain anything.


1919
2:15:7,819 --> 2:15:12,198
I do, because you're acting
like I didn't love you.


1920
2:15:12,198 --> 2:15:26,254
Evelyn,
loving you kept me alive.


1921
2:15:26,254 --> 2:15:27,839
I should've died over there.


1922
2:15:27,839 --> 2:15:34,137
When I was in that water,
I made a deal with God.


1923
2:15:34,137 --> 2:15:35,847
I told him I was sorry...


1924
2:15:35,847 --> 2:15:38,683
that I knew I'd been a fool
for leaving you...


1925
2:15:38,683 --> 2:15:42,27
trying to go over there
and be a hero...


1926
2:15:42,27 --> 2:15:45,565
and I promised I'd never ask
for anything again...


1927
2:15:45,565 --> 2:15:51,988
if I could just see you
one more time.


1928
2:15:51,988 --> 2:15:55,324
And you know what?


1929
2:15:55,324 --> 2:15:58,578
It was worth it.


1930
2:15:58,578 --> 2:16:3,166
You kept me alive, Evelyn.
You brought me home.


1931
2:16:3,166 --> 2:16:5,543
So I'm gonna stand by
my end of the deal.


1932
2:16:5,543 --> 2:16:7,336
I'm gonna walk away.


1933
2:16:7,336 --> 2:16:10,757
And I won't ask you
for anything.


1934
2:16:10,757 --> 2:16:12,55
But I just want to know why.


1935
2:16:12,55 --> 2:16:17,54
Just tell me that, will you,
please? Just tell me why.


1936
2:16:17,54 --> 2:16:28,232
Rafe, I'm pregnant.


1937
2:16:28,232 --> 2:16:33,362
Oh, my God.


1938
2:16:33,362 --> 2:16:38,242
I didn't even know until
the day you turned up alive.


1939
2:16:38,242 --> 2:16:42,497
And then all this happened.


1940
2:16:42,497 --> 2:16:45,374
I haven't told Danny.


1941
2:16:45,374 --> 2:16:47,627
I don't want him to know.


1942
2:16:47,627 --> 2:16:49,545
All he needs to think about...


1943
2:16:49,545 --> 2:16:55,218
is how to do this mission
and get back alive.


1944
2:16:55,218 --> 2:16:58,513
Rafe, all I ever wanted...


1945
2:16:58,513 --> 2:17:1,808
was for us to have a home,
grow old together...


1946
2:17:1,808 --> 2:17:4,811
but life never asked me
what I wanted.


1947
2:17:4,811 --> 2:17:9,941
Now, I'm gonna give Danny
my whole heart...


1948
2:17:9,941 --> 2:17:12,276
but I don't think I'll ever
look at another sunset...


1949
2:17:12,276 --> 2:17:18,116
without thinking of you.


1950
2:17:18,116 --> 2:17:57,864
I'll love you my whole life.


1951
2:17:57,864 --> 2:18:17,216
I'll see you on board.


1952
2:18:17,216 --> 2:18:21,345
You know, the only thing
that scares me...


1953
2:18:21,345 --> 2:18:26,768
is that you might love him
more than you love me.


1954
2:18:26,768 --> 2:18:31,481
I love you, Danny.


1955
2:18:31,481 --> 2:18:52,376
And I'll be here waiting
for you when you come back.


1956
2:18:52,376 --> 2:18:57,256
Follow me.


1957
2:18:57,256 --> 2:19:2,929
Colonel.


1958
2:19:2,929 --> 2:19:4,806
Congratulations
on your promotion, sir.


1959
2:19:4,806 --> 2:19:6,551
I heard what you did.


1960
2:19:6,551 --> 2:19:8,261
We can explain that, sir.


1961
2:19:8,261 --> 2:19:10,103
Explain what?


1962
2:19:10,103 --> 2:19:12,939
Whatever it is
you heard about us, sir.


1963
2:19:12,939 --> 2:19:19,904
You mean the hula shirts
you were flying in?


1964
2:19:19,904 --> 2:19:25,368
Or the seven planes
you shot down?


1965
2:19:25,368 --> 2:19:28,955
You're both being awarded
the Silver Star...


1966
2:19:28,955 --> 2:19:32,291
and promoted to captain.


1967
2:19:32,291 --> 2:19:34,836
Is that the good news,
sir, or...


1968
2:19:34,836 --> 2:19:36,546
You're just about
the only pilots in the Army...


1969
2:19:36,546 --> 2:19:38,965
with combat experience.


1970
2:19:38,965 --> 2:19:40,591
I need you for a mission...


1971
2:19:40,591 --> 2:19:44,262
I've been ordered
to put together.


1972
2:19:44,262 --> 2:19:46,139
You know what top secret is?


1973
2:19:46,139 --> 2:19:47,432
Yes, sir.


1974
2:19:47,432 --> 2:19:50,178
It's the kind of mission
where you get medals.


1975
2:19:50,178 --> 2:19:52,437
But they send 'em
to your relatives.


1976
2:19:52,437 --> 2:19:54,689
Top secret means
you train for something...


1977
2:19:54,689 --> 2:19:57,15
never done before
in aviation history...


1978
2:19:57,15 --> 2:20:0,611
and you go without knowing
where you're going.


1979
2:20:0,611 --> 2:20:4,449
You do it on that basis
or not at all.


1980
2:20:4,449 --> 2:20:6,701
I'll go, sir.


1981
2:20:6,701 --> 2:20:10,747
I'll go, too, sir.


1982
2:20:10,747 --> 2:20:14,41
By the way, the Brits sent
over your personal effects.


1983
2:20:14,41 --> 2:20:15,293
Thank you, sir.


1984
2:20:15,293 --> 2:20:16,711
There's only one more thing.


1985
2:20:16,711 --> 2:20:23,468
Leave your goddamn hula shirts
at home.


1986
2:20:23,468 --> 2:20:24,761
Dear Rafe...


1987
2:20:24,761 --> 2:20:27,18
It's so strange
to be this far from you...


1988
2:20:27,18 --> 2:20:40,61
but you should know this-
every night...


1989
2:20:40,61 --> 2:20:44,197
I've been looking
all over for you.


1990
2:20:44,197 --> 2:20:47,325
Danny, this...


1991
2:20:47,325 --> 2:20:50,787
this ain't no time
to leave things unsaid.


1992
2:20:50,787 --> 2:20:52,789
Now, we gotta face facts here.


1993
2:20:52,789 --> 2:21:3,633
The fact is, we just both love
the same woman.


1994
2:21:3,633 --> 2:21:9,222
She's the first girl I ever
felt this way about, Rafe.


1995
2:21:9,222 --> 2:21:16,813
I couldn't help what happened
any more than you could.


1996
2:21:16,813 --> 2:21:19,232
This is different,
though, Danny.


1997
2:21:19,232 --> 2:21:20,942
Evelyn already lost
the man she loved once.


1998
2:21:20,942 --> 2:21:22,944
I just don't want it to see
that happen to her again.


1999
2:21:22,944 --> 2:21:26,197
Guys like us got no choice.
This is war.


2000
2:21:26,197 --> 2:21:27,824
She knows that.


2001
2:21:27,824 --> 2:21:30,368
Danny, don't do this.


2002
2:21:30,368 --> 2:21:32,995
Don't go on this mission.


2003
2:21:32,995 --> 2:21:36,207
You got nothing to prove.


2004
2:21:36,207 --> 2:21:40,128
You've been protecting me
since we were kids.


2005
2:21:40,128 --> 2:21:41,879
Yeah, well...


2006
2:21:41,879 --> 2:22:3,443
you do tend to need it
from time to time.


2007
2:22:3,443 --> 2:22:5,57
The mission I'm asking you
to volunteer for...


2008
2:22:5,57 --> 2:22:8,3
is exceptionally dangerous.


2009
2:22:8,3 --> 2:22:10,7
Take a look at the man
beside you.


2010
2:22:10,7 --> 2:22:13,286
It's a good bet
that in the next six weeks...


2011
2:22:13,286 --> 2:22:16,539
you or he...


2012
2:22:16,539 --> 2:22:20,918
will be dead.


2013
2:22:20,918 --> 2:22:24,881
Everyone brave enough
to accept this...


2014
2:22:24,881 --> 2:22:34,599
step forward.


2015
2:22:34,599 --> 2:22:36,559
Your grandmother
could take a B-25 off...


2016
2:22:36,559 --> 2:22:39,61
on a mile-long runway.


2017
2:22:39,61 --> 2:22:43,935
Well, I'm gonna train you
to do it in 467 feet.


2018
2:22:43,935 --> 2:22:47,57
Because at 468 feet...


2019
2:22:47,57 --> 2:22:49,614
you're dead.


2020
2:22:49,614 --> 2:22:50,782
And once you get it up...


2021
2:22:50,782 --> 2:22:53,618
you'll learn to fly it
like a fighter...


2022
2:22:53,618 --> 2:22:55,87
thirty feet off the ground.


2023
2:22:55,87 --> 2:22:57,205
I want you to say hello...


2024
2:22:57,205 --> 2:22:59,624
to Lieutenant Jack Richards,
Navy Aviation.


2025
2:22:59,624 --> 2:23:1,876
He'll help us
lighten these fat ladies.


2026
2:23:1,876 --> 2:23:4,87
Dump that ash can.


2027
2:23:4,87 --> 2:23:6,506
See that bomb sight?
Get rid of it.


2028
2:23:6,506 --> 2:23:8,91
Colonel, he's crazy!


2029
2:23:8,91 --> 2:23:10,128
- The lady's fat!
- Listen to him.


2030
2:23:10,128 --> 2:23:17,266
She's fat.
We want a skinny lady!


2031
2:23:17,266 --> 2:23:21,813
Max power!


2032
2:23:21,813 --> 2:23:23,94
Get up, get up!


2033
2:23:23,94 --> 2:23:25,525
- Damn!
- How the heck-


2034
2:23:25,525 --> 2:23:34,7
Damn!


2035
2:23:34,7 --> 2:23:36,536
They just keep
rolling past that line.


2036
2:23:36,536 --> 2:23:37,954
Maybe it's a bad idea.


2037
2:23:37,954 --> 2:23:40,706
No, they're too heavy.
We gotta get drastic.


2038
2:23:40,706 --> 2:23:42,375
This armored plating goes.


2039
2:23:42,375 --> 2:23:45,253
I'm sure, I'm sure.
Lose it like a skirt, son.


2040
2:23:45,253 --> 2:23:48,84
Release brakes!


2041
2:23:48,84 --> 2:23:52,218
Come on, come on!


2042
2:23:52,218 --> 2:23:58,724
- God!
- Put every man on the line!


2043
2:23:58,724 --> 2:24:2,979
Let's show these boys
how this thing is done!


2044
2:24:2,979 --> 2:24:9,861
Come on! Max power.


2045
2:24:9,861 --> 2:24:29,172
Well, if he can do it...


2046
2:24:29,172 --> 2:24:31,215
Well, gentlemen,
now I can tell you...


2047
2:24:31,215 --> 2:24:34,886
that we're going to Tokyo.


2048
2:24:34,886 --> 2:24:42,477
And we're gonna bomb it.


2049
2:24:42,477 --> 2:24:44,312
That comes
as a special request...


2050
2:24:44,312 --> 2:24:46,647
directly from
President Roosevelt.


2051
2:24:46,647 --> 2:24:50,193
The Navy'll sneak us about
400 miles off the coast...


2052
2:24:50,193 --> 2:24:51,569
and we'll launch
from the carrier there.


2053
2:24:51,569 --> 2:24:54,197
Has that been done before?


2054
2:24:54,197 --> 2:24:55,782
Taking Army bombers
off Navy carriers?


2055
2:24:55,782 --> 2:24:58,951
- No.
- OK.


2056
2:24:58,951 --> 2:25:0,787
Any other questions?


2057
2:25:0,787 --> 2:25:2,872
Well, sir, is it even
possible to land...


2058
2:25:2,872 --> 2:25:5,83
a B-25
on an aircraft carrier deck?


2059
2:25:5,83 --> 2:25:7,43
That won't matter.


2060
2:25:7,43 --> 2:25:10,379
As soon as we're airborne,
the carrier heads for Hawaii.


2061
2:25:10,379 --> 2:25:12,632
But without them,
where do we land?


2062
2:25:12,632 --> 2:25:16,928
I have a phrase
I want you to memorize.


2063
2:25:16,928 --> 2:25:20,98
Wo shimeiguo ren.


2064
2:25:20,98 --> 2:25:23,935
It means "I am an American".


2065
2:25:23,935 --> 2:25:26,979
In Chinese.


2066
2:25:26,979 --> 2:25:28,648
Ain't gonna be any easier.


2067
2:25:28,648 --> 2:25:31,359
That's three feet shorter
than our practice runway.


2068
2:25:31,359 --> 2:25:34,404
- Fellas?
- Sir.


2069
2:25:34,404 --> 2:25:37,532
Sir.


2070
2:25:37,532 --> 2:25:40,827
Secretary of the Navy
gave me these.


2071
2:25:40,827 --> 2:25:42,12
What are they?


2072
2:25:42,12 --> 2:25:44,122
Friendship medals
the Japanese gave us...


2073
2:25:44,122 --> 2:25:45,832
when they were pretending
to want peace.


2074
2:25:45,832 --> 2:25:47,208
What'll you do with them?


2075
2:25:47,208 --> 2:25:52,964
Wire them to the bombs
and give them back.


2076
2:25:52,964 --> 2:25:55,133
So what's going on?


2077
2:25:55,133 --> 2:25:57,26
Well, sir,
we only have sixteen planes.


2078
2:25:57,26 --> 2:25:58,553
So?


2079
2:25:58,553 --> 2:26:1,889
When the Japs hit us,
they had more than 300.


2080
2:26:1,889 --> 2:26:4,142
How much difference
can we make?


2081
2:26:4,142 --> 2:26:5,977
It's not that we're afraid,
sir.


2082
2:26:5,977 --> 2:26:12,608
But we might die, and
we want to know what it's for.


2083
2:26:12,608 --> 2:26:17,321
You know, at Pearl,
they hit us with a sledgehammer.


2084
2:26:17,321 --> 2:26:20,616
This raid,
even if we make it through...


2085
2:26:20,616 --> 2:26:23,995
it'll only be a pin prick...


2086
2:26:23,995 --> 2:26:27,165
but it'll be straight
through their hearts.


2087
2:26:27,165 --> 2:26:30,752
Victory belongs to those
that believe in it the most...


2088
2:26:30,752 --> 2:26:33,921
and believe in it the longest.


2089
2:26:33,921 --> 2:26:36,549
We're gonna believe.


2090
2:26:36,549 --> 2:26:38,795
We're gonna make
America believe, too.


2091
2:26:38,795 --> 2:26:43,347
Colonel? I need a minute.


2092
2:26:43,347 --> 2:26:46,225
- Excuse me, Major Jackson?
- Yes?


2093
2:26:46,225 --> 2:26:48,77
Do you remember me?


2094
2:26:48,77 --> 2:26:50,48
Oh, sure I do.


2095
2:26:50,48 --> 2:26:52,94
I'm sorry.
I've been meaning to thank you.


2096
2:26:52,94 --> 2:26:54,609
Well, maybe you can.


2097
2:26:54,609 --> 2:26:57,904
When the news comes in
about the Doolittle boys...


2098
2:26:57,904 --> 2:27:0,573
I want to be
in the command post.


2099
2:27:0,573 --> 2:27:5,62
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you're talking about.


2100
2:27:5,62 --> 2:27:8,873
How the hell
do you know about this mission?


2101
2:27:8,873 --> 2:27:10,875
Let's call it
an inadvertent disclosure.


2102
2:27:10,875 --> 2:27:14,545
Some flyboy you're dating
shot his mouth off.


2103
2:27:14,545 --> 2:27:16,547
Actually,
it's about two pilots.


2104
2:27:16,547 --> 2:27:19,801
I know they're going
into great danger.


2105
2:27:19,801 --> 2:27:22,22
I just want to be there
when the news tells us...


2106
2:27:22,22 --> 2:27:27,642
if they've lived or died.


2107
2:27:27,642 --> 2:27:30,138
Most officers would have
thrown you in the brig.


2108
2:27:30,138 --> 2:27:32,897
Most nurses
wouldn't keep their fingers...


2109
2:27:32,897 --> 2:27:39,987
plugged in your artery.


2110
2:27:39,987 --> 2:27:48,413
I can't promise you anything.


2111
2:27:48,413 --> 2:27:51,249
Hey, Red,
you think they picked us...


2112
2:27:51,249 --> 2:27:55,211
to do this
'cause we're young and dumb?


2113
2:27:55,211 --> 2:28:14,856
Come on, Gooz,
we're the tip of the sword.


2114
2:28:14,856 --> 2:28:16,566
In honor of our trip to Japan...


2115
2:28:16,566 --> 2:28:19,61
I got us some victory cigars!


2116
2:28:19,61 --> 2:28:22,447
- Yeah!
- There you go.


2117
2:28:22,447 --> 2:28:24,776
Put that in your insidepocket,
next to your heart.


2118
2:28:24,776 --> 2:28:26,611
You know, Jack,
we may lose this battle...


2119
2:28:26,611 --> 2:28:29,328
but we're gonna win this war.


2120
2:28:29,328 --> 2:28:33,75
- You know how I know?
- No.


2121
2:28:33,75 --> 2:28:36,2
Them.


2122
2:28:36,2 --> 2:28:38,755
'Cause they're rare.


2123
2:28:38,755 --> 2:28:43,5
And at times like these,
you see them...


2124
2:28:43,5 --> 2:28:46,179
stepping forward.


2125
2:28:46,179 --> 2:28:55,62
There's nothing stronger than
the heart of a volunteer, Jack.


2126
2:28:55,62 --> 2:28:56,314
My friends
in the war department...


2127
2:28:56,314 --> 2:28:58,775
don't want me
to lead this raid...


2128
2:28:58,775 --> 2:29:2,7
because they say
I'm too valuable.


2129
2:29:2,7 --> 2:29:4,86
They don't want me
up in the air...


2130
2:29:4,86 --> 2:29:6,199
flying with the men
that I've chosen...


2131
2:29:6,199 --> 2:29:12,205
that I've chewed out, cussed
out, pushed to the limit...


2132
2:29:12,205 --> 2:29:16,793
and that I've come to respect.


2133
2:29:16,793 --> 2:29:18,795
They want me to stand
on the flight deck...


2134
2:29:18,795 --> 2:29:23,382
and wave you off.
Well, I don't see it that way.


2135
2:29:23,382 --> 2:29:29,806
So I'm going with you.


2136
2:29:29,806 --> 2:29:31,39
We take off
tomorrow afternoon...


2137
2:29:31,39 --> 2:29:33,684
drop our fire,
and head for China.


2138
2:29:33,684 --> 2:29:36,264
Our mission
is to hit military targets...


2139
2:29:36,264 --> 2:29:38,231
aircraft and tank factories.


2140
2:29:38,231 --> 2:29:41,109
Colonel, you've given us
homing beacons...


2141
2:29:41,109 --> 2:29:44,112
but you said China is
overrun with Japanese troops.


2142
2:29:44,112 --> 2:29:46,197
What if the beacons
are switched off?


2143
2:29:46,197 --> 2:29:47,817
Bring her down
any way you can...


2144
2:29:47,817 --> 2:29:49,409
and do your best
to avoid capture.


2145
2:29:49,409 --> 2:29:52,537
What if we have to bail out
over Japan?


2146
2:29:52,537 --> 2:29:56,958
Well, in that situation,
I can't tell you what to do.


2147
2:29:56,958 --> 2:30:2,131
What would you do, Colonel?


2148
2:30:2,131 --> 2:30:6,9
I wasn't built
to be a prisoner...


2149
2:30:6,9 --> 2:30:8,971
so I would have
my crew bail out.


2150
2:30:8,971 --> 2:30:11,723
I'd find the sweetest
military target I could...


2151
2:30:11,723 --> 2:30:18,941
and drive my plane right
smack into the middle of it...


2152
2:30:18,941 --> 2:30:23,528
But that's just me.


2153
2:30:23,528 --> 2:30:25,822
I'm forty-five years old.
I'm an old man.


2154
2:30:25,822 --> 2:30:29,117
You guys have your whole lives
ahead of you...


2155
2:30:29,117 --> 2:30:38,543
so what you do is up to you.


2156
2:30:38,543 --> 2:30:41,713
The mission will launch
in a couple of hours.


2157
2:30:41,713 --> 2:30:47,261
You'll stay right in here.


2158
2:30:47,261 --> 2:30:48,679
Here. Stay here.


2159
2:30:48,679 --> 2:30:50,847
Don't talk to them.
They won't talk to you.


2160
2:30:50,847 --> 2:30:52,426
Pretend to type
the information we pass you.


2161
2:30:52,426 --> 2:30:55,519
That's it.


2162
2:30:55,519 --> 2:30:59,439
This is Orphan Annie
from Radio Tokyo.


2163
2:30:59,439 --> 2:31:2,15
To all the lonely boys
in the South Pacific...


2164
2:31:2,15 --> 2:31:4,528
watch out-
the enemy will get you.


2165
2:31:4,528 --> 2:31:10,284
Maybe she's right.


2166
2:31:10,284 --> 2:31:14,162
Japs transmitting!


2167
2:31:14,162 --> 2:31:16,742
Captain, radar reports
Japanese patrol boats.


2168
2:31:16,742 --> 2:31:18,458
- Range 400 yards.
- How many yards?


2169
2:31:18,458 --> 2:31:20,85
400 yards and closing, sir.


2170
2:31:20,85 --> 2:31:23,13
Richards, Japs!
400 yards! Let's go!


2171
2:31:23,13 --> 2:31:26,8
Admiral Halsey's ordering
the cruisers to open fire!


2172
2:31:26,8 --> 2:31:29,46
We gotta sink these Jap boats
before they give us away.


2173
2:31:29,46 --> 2:31:30,339
Go to general quarters!


2174
2:31:30,339 --> 2:31:32,775
Go, go, go, go!


2175
2:31:32,775 --> 2:31:35,309
Oh, my God.


2176
2:31:35,309 --> 2:31:38,2
This can't be good!


2177
2:31:38,2 --> 2:31:44,151
All hands,
man your battle stations.


2178
2:31:44,151 --> 2:31:47,404
Japs one mile away.
They reported our position.


2179
2:31:47,404 --> 2:31:50,407
Supposed to launch
400 miles away. How far are we?


2180
2:31:50,407 --> 2:31:52,34
624 miles.


2181
2:31:52,34 --> 2:31:58,79
- Jesus!
- What do you want to do?


2182
2:31:58,79 --> 2:32:1,46
Colonel, I don't know
if the planes...


2183
2:32:1,46 --> 2:32:4,87
can carry enough fuel
to make it to China.


2184
2:32:4,87 --> 2:32:7,925
Now. We launch now!


2185
2:32:7,925 --> 2:32:10,87
Army pilots! Man your planes!


2186
2:32:10,87 --> 2:32:14,765
Man your planes!


2187
2:32:14,765 --> 2:32:16,948
They're shooting at something.


2188
2:32:16,948 --> 2:32:30,656
- Let's go!
- It ain't a drill!


2189
2:32:30,656 --> 2:32:33,75
Colonel!
We're too far out to make it!


2190
2:32:33,75 --> 2:32:36,78
They need more fuel,
but they can't get too heavy!


2191
2:32:36,78 --> 2:32:42,84
Strip everything out of
this plane you don't need now!


2192
2:32:42,84 --> 2:32:43,752
Start pre-flight! Let's go!


2193
2:32:43,752 --> 2:32:46,505
Add ten cans of fuel
for each plane!


2194
2:32:46,505 --> 2:32:51,551
Every plane!


2195
2:32:51,551 --> 2:32:53,553
Let's go! Move!


2196
2:32:53,553 --> 2:32:54,972
Guys, get up there!


2197
2:32:54,972 --> 2:32:56,974
Lose those suitcases now!


2198
2:32:56,974 --> 2:32:58,684
- What's your favorite gun?
- What?


2199
2:32:58,684 --> 2:33:2,62
You want off this deck,
give me a gun now!


2200
2:33:2,62 --> 2:33:4,523
It's still too heavy!


2201
2:33:4,523 --> 2:33:7,985
Go to the kitchen,
get some broomsticks.


2202
2:33:7,985 --> 2:33:9,695
Cut 'em down, paint 'em black,
and bring them here.


2203
2:33:9,695 --> 2:33:12,864
We'll put a broomstick
where this gun was.


2204
2:33:12,864 --> 2:33:14,575
What are you doing
to my plane?


2205
2:33:14,575 --> 2:33:20,706
Tell your crew to take a piss
before they take off.


2206
2:33:20,706 --> 2:33:22,708
We got broomsticks
for tail guns.


2207
2:33:22,708 --> 2:33:26,295
Yeah.
Maybe it'll scare 'em.


2208
2:33:26,295 --> 2:33:28,297
You take care of yourself
up there.


2209
2:33:28,297 --> 2:33:29,423
Yeah, I will.


2210
2:33:29,423 --> 2:33:32,593
Danny, be careful, you hear me?


2211
2:33:32,593 --> 2:33:34,72
I will.
I'll see you, Rafe.


2212
2:33:34,72 --> 2:33:43,2
Rafe!
We're the tip of the sword!


2213
2:33:43,2 --> 2:33:50,444
- Turning on one!
- Turning on two!


2214
2:33:50,444 --> 2:33:52,29
All right.


2215
2:33:52,29 --> 2:33:56,408
You ready for this?


2216
2:33:56,408 --> 2:33:59,411
- Superchargers low and latched!
- Low and latched.


2217
2:33:59,411 --> 2:34:1,163
We're full into the wind!


2218
2:34:1,163 --> 2:34:14,343
More speed! More speed!


2219
2:34:14,343 --> 2:34:15,796
Are you nervous?


2220
2:34:15,796 --> 2:34:17,22
No-yes, sir. Yes.


2221
2:34:17,22 --> 2:34:18,805
When did you find religion?


2222
2:34:18,805 --> 2:34:21,93
When you assigned me
to this mission, sir.


2223
2:34:21,93 --> 2:34:22,768
Do me a favor.


2224
2:34:22,768 --> 2:34:25,229
- What's that, Colonel?
- Pray for both of us.


2225
2:34:25,229 --> 2:34:26,48
Tell me when!


2226
2:34:26,48 --> 2:34:36,657
Let's go!


2227
2:34:36,657 --> 2:34:41,37
Max power!


2228
2:34:41,37 --> 2:34:44,39
Oh, please.


2229
2:34:44,39 --> 2:34:55,801
Come on! Come on!


2230
2:34:55,801 --> 2:34:56,969
Yeah!


2231
2:34:56,969 --> 2:35:0,55
Way to go!


2232
2:35:0,55 --> 2:35:4,393
Jesus, that was short.


2233
2:35:4,393 --> 2:35:6,687
Move 'em up!


2234
2:35:6,687 --> 2:35:10,983
Full power, here we go!


2235
2:35:10,983 --> 2:35:20,867
Pull back!


2236
2:35:20,867 --> 2:35:23,745
Ha ha ha!


2237
2:35:23,745 --> 2:35:37,593
Come on, here we go, here we go!


2238
2:35:37,593 --> 2:35:57,29
We made it!


2239
2:35:57,29 --> 2:35:59,66
From Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo...


2240
2:35:59,66 --> 2:36:1,7
we have been described...


2241
2:36:1,7 --> 2:36:4,745
as a nation of weaklings
and playboys...


2242
2:36:4,745 --> 2:36:8,457
who hire British,
Russian, or Chinese soldiers...


2243
2:36:8,457 --> 2:36:11,43
to do our fighting for us.


2244
2:36:11,43 --> 2:36:13,921
Let them repeat that now.


2245
2:36:13,921 --> 2:36:17,633
Let them tell that to
General MacArthur and his men.


2246
2:36:17,633 --> 2:36:21,345
Let them tell that
to the soldiers who today...


2247
2:36:21,345 --> 2:36:25,182
are fighting hard in
the far waters of the Pacific.


2248
2:36:25,182 --> 2:36:29,388
Let them tell that to the boys
in the flying fortresses.


2249
2:36:29,388 --> 2:36:33,774
Let them tell that
to the Marines.


2250
2:36:33,774 --> 2:36:37,236
That's Japan, fellas.
Tighten up back there!


2251
2:36:37,236 --> 2:36:39,738
Man your guns!


2252
2:36:39,738 --> 2:36:43,2
We're in the enemy's backyard!


2253
2:36:43,2 --> 2:36:52,668
Look alive back there.
I see coastline.


2254
2:36:52,668 --> 2:36:59,132
Heads up, boys! Heads up!


2255
2:36:59,132 --> 2:37:1,93
Man your guns back there.


2256
2:37:1,93 --> 2:37:3,136
I'm cocked and locked!


2257
2:37:3,136 --> 2:37:12,688
Get ready, suckers!


2258
2:37:12,688 --> 2:37:14,398
Approaching
targets for bombing raid!


2259
2:37:14,398 --> 2:37:17,276
Open bomb bay doors.


2260
2:37:17,276 --> 2:37:20,988
Ripley,
you gota target in sight?


2261
2:37:20,988 --> 2:37:31,999
37 degrees!
Target in sight!


2262
2:37:31,999 --> 2:37:34,376
All right, boys,
let's knock their clocks off!


2263
2:37:34,376 --> 2:37:36,42
- Drop your ordnance!
- Bombs away!


2264
2:37:36,42 --> 2:37:38,38
One away!


2265
2:37:38,38 --> 2:37:40,626
- Bombs away!
- Bombs away!


2266
2:37:40,626 --> 2:37:51,31
Two away!


2267
2:37:51,31 --> 2:37:57,19
Three away!
Four away!


2268
2:37:57,19 --> 2:37:59,443
We caught 'em by surprise!


2269
2:37:59,443 --> 2:38:2,404
- Dropping ordnance!
- Bombs away!


2270
2:38:2,404 --> 2:38:10,37
...factory.


2271
2:38:10,37 --> 2:38:11,914
- Whoo!
- We got it!


2272
2:38:11,914 --> 2:38:26,929
We hit our targets!
Good job, raiders!


2273
2:38:26,929 --> 2:38:32,59
God! Jesus-what? Shit!


2274
2:38:32,59 --> 2:38:36,63
We got flak everywhere!


2275
2:38:36,63 --> 2:38:37,481
Go down there and get Gooz!


2276
2:38:37,481 --> 2:38:39,399
I want everyone to separate!


2277
2:38:39,399 --> 2:38:41,395
- Clean that up!
- Yes, sir.


2278
2:38:41,395 --> 2:38:42,778
Try and clean that up!


2279
2:38:42,778 --> 2:38:55,415
They're shooting flak at us!


2280
2:38:55,415 --> 2:39:0,796
We gotta get out of this shit,
Gooz!


2281
2:39:0,796 --> 2:39:4,8
- We got a fire!
- Tail's hit!


2282
2:39:4,8 --> 2:39:7,587
The electrics!
We got a fire back here!


2283
2:39:7,587 --> 2:39:10,97
I gotta short this out!


2284
2:39:10,97 --> 2:39:26,989
Get into the clouds,
Danny, right now!


2285
2:39:26,989 --> 2:39:29,575
God damn!


2286
2:39:29,575 --> 2:39:36,456
Red, go check that out!


2287
2:39:36,456 --> 2:39:38,0
We're getting covered!


2288
2:39:38,0 --> 2:39:42,379
Just hope they don't hit a prop!


2289
2:39:42,379 --> 2:39:44,82
Unh!


2290
2:39:44,82 --> 2:39:45,841
I'm hit!


2291
2:39:45,841 --> 2:39:49,303
They're tearing
this plane apart!


2292
2:39:49,303 --> 2:39:51,305
Red, take it up, 800 feet.


2293
2:39:51,305 --> 2:39:55,601
Aah!


2294
2:39:55,601 --> 2:39:59,146
I think Theo's dead!
Theo, wake up!


2295
2:39:59,146 --> 2:40:1,315
Theo!


2296
2:40:1,315 --> 2:40:2,733
Get into the clouds,
Danny, right now!


2297
2:40:2,733 --> 2:40:3,901
Get up in that soup!


2298
2:40:3,901 --> 2:40:19,333
We're gonna pull out of this,
Gooz!


2299
2:40:19,333 --> 2:40:25,714
Thank you, George.


2300
2:40:25,714 --> 2:40:27,174
What is it, General?


2301
2:40:27,174 --> 2:40:30,218
Colonel Doolittle had to
advance his execution order...


2302
2:40:30,218 --> 2:40:32,54
by twelve hours, Mr. President.


2303
2:40:32,54 --> 2:40:33,805
There will be no homing beacons.


2304
2:40:33,805 --> 2:40:36,51
The plane carrying them
crashed en route to China...


2305
2:40:36,51 --> 2:40:38,6
and our bombers
may lack the fuel...


2306
2:40:38,6 --> 2:40:39,811
to reach the mainland, sir.


2307
2:40:39,811 --> 2:40:47,194
So our boys are flying blind
on empty tanks.


2308
2:40:47,194 --> 2:40:57,12
God help them.


2309
2:40:57,12 --> 2:40:59,539
We're still not
getting a signal.


2310
2:40:59,539 --> 2:41:1,993
All ocean and no land.


2311
2:41:1,993 --> 2:41:6,797
Homing in on nothing.


2312
2:41:6,797 --> 2:41:8,966
How many cans of fuel
we got left?


2313
2:41:8,966 --> 2:41:11,969
These are all empty!


2314
2:41:11,969 --> 2:41:13,553
Is this all you got?


2315
2:41:13,553 --> 2:41:15,264
That's all we got, Red.


2316
2:41:15,264 --> 2:41:23,272
Rafe! You better pray for land!


2317
2:41:23,272 --> 2:41:26,4
Break radio silence.


2318
2:41:26,4 --> 2:41:29,111
I'm sorry, gentlemen.


2319
2:41:29,111 --> 2:41:31,405
You're all brave souls.


2320
2:41:31,405 --> 2:41:34,7
The bravest I've ever had
the privilege of flying with.


2321
2:41:34,7 --> 2:41:42,124
But we're on our own.


2322
2:41:42,124 --> 2:42:0,475
This really was
a suicide mission.


2323
2:42:0,475 --> 2:42:2,19
Engine one's fluctuating.


2324
2:42:2,19 --> 2:42:5,731
We'll lose it any minute.


2325
2:42:5,731 --> 2:42:11,486
- Rafe, you gotta prime it.
- I am. How about now?


2326
2:42:11,486 --> 2:42:13,44
I see the coast.


2327
2:42:13,44 --> 2:42:16,325
I see the coast!


2328
2:42:16,325 --> 2:42:18,35
Copy that, Rafe.


2329
2:42:18,35 --> 2:42:19,745
We're gonna make it.


2330
2:42:19,745 --> 2:42:21,163
Danny, follow me.


2331
2:42:21,163 --> 2:42:23,4
We can make this.
I can see the coast now.


2332
2:42:23,4 --> 2:42:24,499
We're only a few miles out.


2333
2:42:24,499 --> 2:42:27,21
We gotta find
a soft landing spot.


2334
2:42:27,21 --> 2:42:29,46
I'm pushing up on two.


2335
2:42:29,46 --> 2:42:31,34
Hold on
for a hard landing!


2336
2:42:31,34 --> 2:42:33,5
I see rice paddies.


2337
2:42:33,5 --> 2:42:36,762
We'll bring it in right here.


2338
2:42:36,762 --> 2:42:38,805
Oh, God, engine one's dead.


2339
2:42:38,805 --> 2:42:44,728
We'll lose engine two
any second.


2340
2:42:44,728 --> 2:42:47,105
We can make it in. Easy.


2341
2:42:47,105 --> 2:42:52,402
Pull it back, glide in on fumes.


2342
2:42:52,402 --> 2:42:53,654
Japs!


2343
2:42:53,654 --> 2:42:55,948
We got Jap patrols
all over the place!


2344
2:42:55,948 --> 2:42:58,659
Japs! Land somewhere else!


2345
2:42:58,659 --> 2:43:1,78
Strap yourselves in!
We're coming in hard!


2346
2:43:1,78 --> 2:43:2,698
We're a deadstick.


2347
2:43:2,698 --> 2:43:5,54
Get outta the nose!


2348
2:43:5,54 --> 2:43:10,87
Hold on, boys!
We're going down!


2349
2:43:10,87 --> 2:43:35,279
Watch the trees!


2350
2:43:35,279 --> 2:43:38,407
Everyone all right?


2351
2:43:38,407 --> 2:43:41,41
I'm OK! I'm OK!


2352
2:43:41,41 --> 2:43:43,996
Where's Ripley?


2353
2:43:43,996 --> 2:43:46,582
He's dead.


2354
2:43:46,582 --> 2:43:57,426
Watch for Japs!


2355
2:43:57,426 --> 2:44:17,404
- Jap patrols!
- Take cover!


2356
2:44:17,404 --> 2:44:18,739
Who's got magazines?


2357
2:44:18,739 --> 2:44:20,32
Got em!


2358
2:44:20,32 --> 2:44:27,164
Gotta get up into those hills,
find the Chinese!


2359
2:44:27,164 --> 2:44:39,927
They got us pinned down!


2360
2:44:39,927 --> 2:44:42,638
- Danny!
- Rafe! Rafe, no!


2361
2:44:42,638 --> 2:44:44,181
Danny!


2362
2:44:44,181 --> 2:44:49,228
Rafe, you don't have a chance!


2363
2:44:49,228 --> 2:44:51,974
God damn. Danny!


2364
2:44:51,974 --> 2:44:57,819
Come on!


2365
2:44:57,819 --> 2:44:59,71
Gooz? You OK, man?


2366
2:44:59,71 --> 2:45:2,824
Danny? Aw, shit, Anthony.


2367
2:45:2,824 --> 2:45:5,786
Gooz! Can you hear me?


2368
2:45:5,786 --> 2:45:9,122
- Yeah.
- Come on.


2369
2:45:9,122 --> 2:45:11,792
Danny.
Easy, easy, easy.


2370
2:45:11,792 --> 2:45:13,377
I've had better landings.


2371
2:45:13,377 --> 2:45:14,753
You saved us back there.


2372
2:45:14,753 --> 2:45:16,421
I got something in my neck.


2373
2:45:16,421 --> 2:45:18,548
- Let me pull this out.
- Where's Gooz?


2374
2:45:18,548 --> 2:45:38,443
He's fine.
He's right over there.


2375
2:45:38,443 --> 2:46:39,922
Rafe!


2376
2:46:39,922 --> 2:46:50,933
Grenade!


2377
2:46:50,933 --> 2:46:52,517
Danny.


2378
2:46:52,517 --> 2:46:54,394
Danny!


2379
2:46:54,394 --> 2:46:59,65
Danny! Oh!


2380
2:46:59,65 --> 2:47:1,777
- Hold on!
- Rafe!


2381
2:47:1,777 --> 2:47:3,528
Hold on, now. I got you.


2382
2:47:3,528 --> 2:47:6,114
You're all right.
You're all right.


2383
2:47:6,114 --> 2:47:12,663
I'm not gonna make it.


2384
2:47:12,663 --> 2:47:14,39
Oh, yes, you are.


2385
2:47:14,39 --> 2:47:17,536
Yes, you are. Now look at me.


2386
2:47:17,536 --> 2:47:21,88
Rafe, I'm so cold.
I'm so cold.


2387
2:47:21,88 --> 2:47:27,261
You're all right. Hey.


2388
2:47:27,261 --> 2:47:29,721
Hey, Rafe?


2389
2:47:29,721 --> 2:47:31,431
Can you do me a favor?


2390
2:47:31,431 --> 2:47:33,1
What?


2391
2:47:33,1 --> 2:47:37,306
Can you have someone else
write my name on the tombstone?


2392
2:47:37,306 --> 2:47:40,399
You're not gonna die.
Look at me, listen to me!


2393
2:47:40,399 --> 2:47:42,401
You ain't gonna die,
you hear me?


2394
2:47:42,401 --> 2:47:44,403
Danny.


2395
2:47:44,403 --> 2:47:45,696
Danny, you can't die.


2396
2:47:45,696 --> 2:47:47,67
You can't die. You know why?


2397
2:47:47,67 --> 2:47:49,7
'Cause you're gonna be a father.


2398
2:47:49,7 --> 2:47:51,994
You're gonna be a daddy.


2399
2:47:51,994 --> 2:47:56,29
I wasn't supposed to tell you.


2400
2:47:56,29 --> 2:48:0,294
You're gonna be a father.


2401
2:48:0,294 --> 2:48:6,8
Please.


2402
2:48:6,8 --> 2:48:17,895
No. You are.


2403
2:48:17,895 --> 2:48:21,607
Danny.


2404
2:48:21,607 --> 2:48:25,485
Danny?


2405
2:48:25,485 --> 2:48:27,648
Please, please!


2406
2:48:27,648 --> 2:48:32,2
Please.


2407
2:48:32,2 --> 2:48:34,912
God.


2408
2:48:34,912 --> 2:48:47,633
Please, Danny.


2409
2:48:47,633 --> 2:50:11,717
Hold your fire!
They're Chinese.


2410
2:50:11,717 --> 2:50:14,136
When the action is over
and we look back...


2411
2:50:14,136 --> 2:50:18,56
we understand
both more and less.


2412
2:50:18,56 --> 2:50:20,309
This much is certain.


2413
2:50:20,309 --> 2:50:21,894
Before the Doolittle raid...


2414
2:50:21,894 --> 2:50:24,396
America knew nothing
but defeat.


2415
2:50:24,396 --> 2:50:27,733
After it, there was hope of victory.


2416
2:50:27,733 --> 2:50:30,938
Japan realized for the first
time that they could lose...


2417
2:50:30,938 --> 2:50:32,613
and began to pull back.


2418
2:50:32,613 --> 2:50:34,448
America realized
that she would win...


2419
2:50:34,448 --> 2:50:36,617
and surged forward.


2420
2:50:36,617 --> 2:50:39,329
It was a war
that changed America...


2421
2:50:39,329 --> 2:50:41,128
...and the world.


2422
2:50:41,128 --> 2:50:43,296
Dorie Miller was
the first black American...


2423
2:50:43,296 --> 2:50:45,716
to be awarded the Navy Cross.


2424
2:50:45,716 --> 2:50:47,426
But he would not be the last.


2425
2:50:47,426 --> 2:50:56,578
He joined
a brotherhood of heroes.


2426
2:50:56,578 --> 2:51:8,841
That's for all the raiders.


2427
2:51:8,841 --> 2:51:12,261
World War II for us
began at Pearl Harbor...


2428
2:51:12,261 --> 2:51:15,848
and 1,177 men
still lie entombed...


2429
2:51:15,848 --> 2:51:18,684
in the battleship Arizona.


2430
2:51:18,684 --> 2:51:23,21
America suffered...
but America grew stronger.


2431
2:51:23,21 --> 2:51:25,149
It was not inevitable.


2432
2:51:25,149 --> 2:51:27,943
The times tried our souls...


2433
2:51:27,943 --> 2:51:52,384
and through the trial,
we overcame.


2434
2:51:52,384 --> 2:51:53,677
Hey, Danny...


2435
2:51:53,677 --> 2:51:57,806
how'd you like to go flying?


2436
2:51:57,806 --> 2:53:5,574
Come here.


2437
2:53:5,574 --> 2:53:9,404
When I think back
on these times


2438
2:53:9,404 --> 2:53:13,332
And the dreams we left behind


2439
2:53:13,332 --> 2:53:16,203
I'll be glad
'cause I was blessed


2440
2:53:16,203 --> 2:53:20,589
To get to have you in my life


2441
2:53:20,589 --> 2:53:23,925
When I look back on these days


2442
2:53:23,925 --> 2:53:28,472
I'll look and see your face


2443
2:53:28,472 --> 2:53:35,771
You were right there for me


2444
2:53:35,771 --> 2:53:38,683
In my dreams
I'll always see you


2445
2:53:38,683 --> 2:53:43,236
Soar above the sky


2446
2:53:43,236 --> 2:53:47,783
In my heart, there'll
always be a place for you


2447
2:53:47,783 --> 2:53:50,786
For all my life


2448
2:53:50,786 --> 2:53:56,958
I'll keep a part of you
with me


2449
2:53:56,958 --> 2:53:59,961
And everywhere I am


2450
2:53:59,961 --> 2:54:3,625
There you'll be


2451
2:54:3,625 --> 2:54:7,386
And everywhere I am


2452
2:54:7,386 --> 2:54:13,558
There you'll be


2453
2:54:13,558 --> 2:54:17,145
Well, you showed me
how it feels


2454
2:54:17,145 --> 2:54:20,816
Feel the sky with in my reach


2455
2:54:20,816 --> 2:54:24,236
And I always will remember


2456
2:54:24,236 --> 2:54:28,407
All the strength
you gave to me


2457
2:54:28,407 --> 2:54:31,41
Your love made me
make it through


2458
2:54:31,41 --> 2:54:36,95
Oh, I owe so much to you


2459
2:54:36,95 --> 2:54:43,588
You were right there for me


2460
2:54:43,588 --> 2:54:46,717
In my dreams
I'll always see you


2461

'Cause I always saw
in you my light


2469
2:55:13,487 --> 2:55:17,205

2470
2:55:17,205 --> 2:55:19,458
And I want to thank you now


2471
2:55:19,458 --> 2:55:23,754
For all the ways


2472
2:55:23,754 --> 2:55:27,758
You were right there for me


2473
2:55:27,758 --> 2:55:31,219
You were right there for me


2474
