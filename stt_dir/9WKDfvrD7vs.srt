2
0:0:1,757 --> 0:0:3,84
NATHAN ROGERS: Hi, and
welcome to Talks at Google.


3
0:0:3,84 --> 0:0:5,52
My name's Nathan Rogers.


4
0:0:5,52 --> 0:0:8,75
And today, I've the pleasure
of introducing one of my best


5
0:0:8,75 --> 0:0:12,18
friends, Rose McAleese
to give a talk today.


6
0:0:12,18 --> 0:0:14,27
So without further
ado, here is Rose.


7
0:0:14,27 --> 0:0:20,27



8
0:0:20,27 --> 0:0:22,36
ROSE McALEESE: Hi, my
name is Rose McAleese.


9
0:0:22,36 --> 0:0:24,849
I'm a poet from
Seattle, Washington.


10
0:0:24,849 --> 0:0:26,14
I'm just going to jump into it.


11
0:0:26,14 --> 0:0:29,32



12
0:0:29,32 --> 0:0:32,95
You want to divorce me.


13
0:0:32,95 --> 0:0:33,64
Fine.


14
0:0:33,64 --> 0:0:37,45
You wish to divorce me.


15
0:0:37,45 --> 0:0:41,38
[DERISIVE LAUGH] You silly crow,
wingspan too short of raven,


16
0:0:41,38 --> 0:0:43,39
you foolish king, if
it was not for me,


17
0:0:43,39 --> 0:0:46,1
you would have no hunger
for demise or conquer,


18
0:0:46,1 --> 0:0:48,43
crave the flesh of another.


19
0:0:48,43 --> 0:0:53,17
I, your lady, no chambermaid,
rest assure and barren bed


20
0:0:53,17 --> 0:0:55,545
for you, sit waiting past
midnight's croning moan.


21
0:0:55,545 --> 0:0:59,2
Your robes are washed
daily by these hands.


22
0:0:59,2 --> 0:1:1,87
Stone, cold water, rinse.


23
0:1:1,87 --> 0:1:4,8
Make absence of any
bloodshed, I, your wife,


24
0:1:4,8 --> 0:1:6,67
clean up all your messes.


25
0:1:6,67 --> 0:1:9,95
You play no judgment on such
rash decisions as these.


26
0:1:9,95 --> 0:1:12,1
No marks are made in your honor.


27
0:1:12,1 --> 0:1:12,6
This.


28
0:1:12,6 --> 0:1:13,58
Divorce?


29
0:1:13,58 --> 0:1:15,41
You've wandered
too far, my dear.


30
0:1:15,41 --> 0:1:17,43
Coward, I'm calling
you for a coward.


31
0:1:17,43 --> 0:1:20,42
Coward, no hollow, no
backbone to aspire.


32
0:1:20,42 --> 0:1:23,72
Where will you go, Sire?


33
0:1:23,72 --> 0:1:26,79
Oh, Macbeth, such
childish quarrels as these


34
0:1:26,79 --> 0:1:28,11
push us back in our demand.


35
0:1:28,11 --> 0:1:29,804
Who will shine your blade?


36
0:1:29,804 --> 0:1:31,97
Iron the wrinkles out of
your half-hearted strategy.


37
0:1:31,97 --> 0:1:35,53
It is the queen who
makes all the moves.


38
0:1:35,53 --> 0:1:38,89
My scenarios unravel like chess.


39
0:1:38,89 --> 0:1:42,24
And you are just a
pawn, oh my worship, you


40
0:1:42,24 --> 0:1:43,45
are just a wooden pawn.


41
0:1:43,45 --> 0:1:46,385
Names of former lovers
hang over the mantelpiece


42
0:1:46,385 --> 0:1:47,74
that is my heart.


43
0:1:47,74 --> 0:1:49,184
Men, not worthy of royals.


44
0:1:49,184 --> 0:1:50,725
You are lucky enough
to be sacrificed


45
0:1:50,725 --> 0:1:53,47
as a spark in your
potential, flint


46
0:1:53,47 --> 0:1:55,29
in the sense of
you being my Lord.


47
0:1:55,29 --> 0:1:58,94
Now, I know the women here
back their husbands are


48
0:1:58,94 --> 0:2:2,765
victim to naive, and God
smack but I-- I play shadow.


49
0:2:2,765 --> 0:2:5,89
I sit closely to
your heels, because I


50
0:2:5,89 --> 0:2:10,77
Lady Macbeth made every
dagger a happy one.


51
0:2:10,77 --> 0:2:12,99
Bash the ridiculous
notion of failure.


52
0:2:12,99 --> 0:2:15,26
One must steal if
one is not given.


53
0:2:15,26 --> 0:2:18,1
I vow no sleep will
be lost over this.


54
0:2:18,1 --> 0:2:24,78
And I know from experience
all bloodshed can easily


55
0:2:24,78 --> 0:2:26,865
be washed away.


56
0:2:26,865 --> 0:2:28,8
Thanks.


57
0:2:28,8 --> 0:2:29,66
Oh, I need water.


58
0:2:29,66 --> 0:2:30,48
[APPLAUSE]


59
0:2:30,48 --> 0:2:31,92
Oh, OK.


60
0:2:31,92 --> 0:2:35,39
So I like doing that one first,
because it gets the nerves out,


61
0:2:35,39 --> 0:2:36,9
and it scares people.


62
0:2:36,9 --> 0:2:41,64
So then I can win you back
over as the talk goes.


63
0:2:41,64 --> 0:2:43,905
So like I said, I'm
a poet, a spoken word


64
0:2:43,905 --> 0:2:46,1
poet from Seattle, Washington.


65
0:2:46,1 --> 0:2:50,19
A little back history about
myself-- I started doing poetry


66
0:2:50,19 --> 0:2:52,35
'cause when I was
in seventh grade,


67
0:2:52,35 --> 0:2:54,76
I had a great teacher by
the name of Miss Chestnut.


68
0:2:54,76 --> 0:2:58,61
She realized that I was
a rebel without a cause,


69
0:2:58,61 --> 0:3:2,85
like I really tried to
be a bad-- I can't cuss.


70
0:3:2,85 --> 0:3:5,8
A bad butt, but I
couldn't be, because I


71
0:3:5,8 --> 0:3:7,92
was just like I had
no reason to be mad.


72
0:3:7,92 --> 0:3:10,152
So, of course, when you
have no reason to be mad,


73
0:3:10,152 --> 0:3:12,36
and you're seven years old,
you start writing poetry.


74
0:3:12,36 --> 0:3:14,35
And that's pretty much
kind of where I started,


75
0:3:14,35 --> 0:3:17,33
and then I became a spoken
word artist slowly over time.


76
0:3:17,33 --> 0:3:19,544
And then as time
progressed, I realized


77
0:3:19,544 --> 0:3:20,71
that I really love teaching.


78
0:3:20,71 --> 0:3:22,51
And so I started being
a teaching artist,


79
0:3:22,51 --> 0:3:24,66
which is kind of what I do now.


80
0:3:24,66 --> 0:3:29,85
And then I guess,
almost two years ago, I


81
0:3:29,85 --> 0:3:31,59
got my first book published.


82
0:3:31,59 --> 0:3:33,375
You can like buy it now.


83
0:3:33,375 --> 0:3:35,3
You can buy here later,
which is exciting.


84
0:3:35,3 --> 0:3:38,7
It's really weird to be like,
I have a published book.


85
0:3:38,7 --> 0:3:41,38
And so, yeah, I've
just kind of been


86
0:3:41,38 --> 0:3:44,65
a poet and everything
and whatnot.


87
0:3:44,65 --> 0:3:48,95
I was super nervous about this
talk for some weird reason.


88
0:3:48,95 --> 0:3:51,3
I was watching all of
the other Google talks.


89
0:3:51,3 --> 0:3:54,12
And I've noticed that you know,
there's people like Tina Fey


90
0:3:54,12 --> 0:3:56,57
and like Lady Gaga,
who've all been here.


91
0:3:56,57 --> 0:4:0,16
And so it was like, oh, OK,
I'm neither of those people.


92
0:4:0,16 --> 0:4:2,37
I don't know what
I'm going to do.


93
0:4:2,37 --> 0:4:6,35
So my father, god bless
his soul-- he's not dead.


94
0:4:6,35 --> 0:4:7,75
I don't know I just said that.


95
0:4:7,75 --> 0:4:9,44
He's alive and well.


96
0:4:9,44 --> 0:4:13,526
Anyway, my father told me start
talking about what you love


97
0:4:13,526 --> 0:4:14,65
and how passionate you are.


98
0:4:14,65 --> 0:4:15,61
People will be
able to read that.


99
0:4:15,61 --> 0:4:18,459
And whenever I get nervous, I'm
just going to jump into a poem.


100
0:4:18,459 --> 0:4:21,76
So if I start doing something
or anything, just go with it.


101
0:4:21,76 --> 0:4:22,91
OK?


102
0:4:22,91 --> 0:4:25,16
So like I said, I'm
a teaching artist.


103
0:4:25,16 --> 0:4:27,71
And the poem, I just
did was a persona poem


104
0:4:27,71 --> 0:4:28,92
about Lady Macbeth.


105
0:4:28,92 --> 0:4:30,84
I'm a huge Shakespearean nerd.


106
0:4:30,84 --> 0:4:33,55
I fell in love with Shakespeare
when I was about 13 years old,


107
0:4:33,55 --> 0:4:35,83
which was kind of just
disturbing to my parents.


108
0:4:35,83 --> 0:4:37,4
But they were just like,
whatever, at least she's


109
0:4:37,4 --> 0:4:37,64
reading.


110
0:4:37,64 --> 0:4:41,81
Let her be all mournful
and semi-teenage angst,


111
0:4:41,81 --> 0:4:43,4
depressed or whatever it was.


112
0:4:43,4 --> 0:4:44,66
So I started doing that.


113
0:4:44,66 --> 0:4:46,63
And then I got into
acting and realized


114
0:4:46,63 --> 0:4:49,6
that poetry and spoken word
is basically like acting,


115
0:4:49,6 --> 0:4:51,78
but you get to write
your own lines.


116
0:4:51,78 --> 0:4:54,56
And so I started becoming
a teaching artist.


117
0:4:54,56 --> 0:4:57,51
And in schools, it's really
hard to teach middle schoolers


118
0:4:57,51 --> 0:4:59,26
and high school kids poetry.


119
0:4:59,26 --> 0:5:2,17
They're like what do I need to
know about a dead white guy,


120
0:5:2,17 --> 0:5:6,73
pretty much, which is true,
but also you can make your own


121
0:5:6,73 --> 0:5:7,92
and revamp it.


122
0:5:7,92 --> 0:5:12,605
Thank God for people like
Jack Kerouac and Angela Davis


123
0:5:12,605 --> 0:5:15,23
and all these people who've kind
of like reinvented it and made


124
0:5:15,23 --> 0:5:16,646
it their own and
everything, which


125
0:5:16,646 --> 0:5:18,6
is so much fun with
slam poetry because it's


126
0:5:18,6 --> 0:5:24,74
a mixture of beatniks, hip
hop, rap and all that jazz.


127
0:5:24,74 --> 0:5:26,93
So that poem was
written from a writing


128
0:5:26,93 --> 0:5:28,51
prompt that I came
up with my kids,


129
0:5:28,51 --> 0:5:31,24
where I asked them to
take a fictional character


130
0:5:31,24 --> 0:5:33,85
from either movie,
a play or a book.


131
0:5:33,85 --> 0:5:35,46
And they had to
write a monologue


132
0:5:35,46 --> 0:5:37,74
to get on a reality TV show.


133
0:5:37,74 --> 0:5:39,8
So that was Lady
Beth's monologue


134
0:5:39,8 --> 0:5:41,455
to get on the "Bad Girls Club."


135
0:5:41,455 --> 0:5:43,58
I don't know if you guys
know the "Bad Girls Club,"


136
0:5:43,58 --> 0:5:45,326
but it's a show
on Oxygen Channel.


137
0:5:45,326 --> 0:5:47,45
Oh my god, you need to
watch the "Bad Girls Club" !


138
0:5:47,45 --> 0:5:50,509
It is the best
piece of feminism.


139
0:5:50,509 --> 0:5:51,5
Just kidding.


140
0:5:51,5 --> 0:5:52,6
It's not.


141
0:5:52,6 --> 0:5:53,849
Basically, they take
a bunch of girls


142
0:5:53,849 --> 0:5:55,89
put them in a house with
alcohol and Daddy issues


143
0:5:55,89 --> 0:5:57,99
and just let them
roam the world.


144
0:5:57,99 --> 0:5:59,3
And they fight each other.


145
0:5:59,3 --> 0:6:2,65
So let's be honest, Lady Macbeth
would make it on that show,


146
0:6:2,65 --> 0:6:5,17
and she'd be great.


147
0:6:5,17 --> 0:6:5,85
You should watch it.


148
0:6:5,85 --> 0:6:8,86
It's such a great
guilty pleasure.


149
0:6:8,86 --> 0:6:9,592
What else?


150
0:6:9,592 --> 0:6:11,3
So, yeah, that's one
of the pieces I did,


151
0:6:11,3 --> 0:6:13,78
It's also in my
book, which I have.


152
0:6:13,78 --> 0:6:14,53
I want to show it.


153
0:6:14,53 --> 0:6:15,922
Where is it?


154
0:6:15,922 --> 0:6:16,63
I want to get it.


155
0:6:16,63 --> 0:6:17,8
Sorry!


156
0:6:17,8 --> 0:6:18,49
I should have had
my props ready.


157
0:6:18,49 --> 0:6:19,827
I'm running offscreen.


158
0:6:19,827 --> 0:6:20,91
This is going to be crazy.


159
0:6:20,91 --> 0:6:23,68



160
0:6:23,68 --> 0:6:25,43
I still can't get over this.


161
0:6:25,43 --> 0:6:28,79
Like, I first got in my house
one day, and there it was.


162
0:6:28,79 --> 0:6:32,546
And some guy named Tom
Robbins read it and liked it.


163
0:6:32,546 --> 0:6:33,92
And so did Rachel
[? McKibbens ?]


164
0:6:33,92 --> 0:6:36,99
and [INAUDIBLE].


165
0:6:36,99 --> 0:6:41,75
I'm going to read one
more piece from this book.


166
0:6:41,75 --> 0:6:47,24
I'll read a bunch of pieces,
but I really like this piece.


167
0:6:47,24 --> 0:6:48,57
So I grew up with a very-- oh!


168
0:6:48,57 --> 0:6:49,9
Someone walking in.


169
0:6:49,9 --> 0:6:51,23
Hi.


170
0:6:51,23 --> 0:6:57,68
I grew up with a very, very
Irish father, super Irish.


171
0:6:57,68 --> 0:6:59,54
Also, a fun fact
about this book,


172
0:6:59,54 --> 0:7:1,93
I wrote it when I was single.


173
0:7:1,93 --> 0:7:4,419



174
0:7:4,419 --> 0:7:5,96
Can't believe that
I a boyfriend now,


175
0:7:5,96 --> 0:7:7,376
because if you
read this book, you


176
0:7:7,376 --> 0:7:9,72
would be like why
would you date her?


177
0:7:9,72 --> 0:7:13,38
So, sorry for the
guy who dates me.


178
0:7:13,38 --> 0:7:15,82
This poem is called "Why
I Don't Write Love Poems."


179
0:7:15,82 --> 0:7:18,51
And it starts out with a
quote from a smart man named


180
0:7:18,51 --> 0:7:22,81
Charles McAleese, called "He
Says People are no Damn Good,


181
0:7:22,81 --> 0:7:26,11
and Men Are Worse."


182
0:7:26,11 --> 0:7:28,4
I've come to the
conclusion that I'm not


183
0:7:28,4 --> 0:7:32,5
made for love, that feelings are
just tightly wound compasses,


184
0:7:32,5 --> 0:7:35,27
trying to make it home
after a long night.


185
0:7:35,27 --> 0:7:37,78
Romance is a store
brand laundry detergent


186
0:7:37,78 --> 0:7:40,19
we use to wash away our naive.


187
0:7:40,19 --> 0:7:42,17
Why do we love love?


188
0:7:42,17 --> 0:7:44,72
Love clearly hates us.


189
0:7:44,72 --> 0:7:47,4
I don't trust men who
know my middle name.


190
0:7:47,4 --> 0:7:49,12
I don't trust men who
can charm my father


191
0:7:49,12 --> 0:7:50,61
or drink like him either.


192
0:7:50,61 --> 0:7:53,69
I don't trust men who smile too
big, whose best traits are all


193
0:7:53,69 --> 0:7:54,19
physical.


194
0:7:54,19 --> 0:7:57,5
I don't trust pretty
boys with nice eyes.


195
0:7:57,5 --> 0:7:59,58
I don't trust guys who ask,
if you can't have children,


196
0:7:59,58 --> 0:8:1,2
why do I need to wear a condom?


197
0:8:1,2 --> 0:8:3,68
Well, first, you
need to leave me


198
0:8:3,68 --> 0:8:6,32
with a mouth of rusty nails
and a clinic phone number.


199
0:8:6,32 --> 0:8:9,71
One led me to believe that I
can save fish from drowning.


200
0:8:9,71 --> 0:8:13,83
That man gave me a hammer and
told me to fix my own problems.


201
0:8:13,83 --> 0:8:17,56
White Boy called me
intimidating, too much.


202
0:8:17,56 --> 0:8:19,7
Lover-- not the
same shade as me,


203
0:8:19,7 --> 0:8:22,72
reassures his mother
I was just a friend.


204
0:8:22,72 --> 0:8:26,1
Boy told me we would work out,
because he didn't want children


205
0:8:26,1 --> 0:8:28,5
either, because he made
sure to call me a dead end


206
0:8:28,5 --> 0:8:29,49
before he left.


207
0:8:29,49 --> 0:8:30,94
There is a pattern.


208
0:8:30,94 --> 0:8:33,97
I love like my body, barren.


209
0:8:33,97 --> 0:8:37,78
Now men who say I'm too strong
need to be men about it.


210
0:8:37,78 --> 0:8:40,73
I mean handle your shit,
make more eye contact,


211
0:8:40,73 --> 0:8:42,27
speak more loudly
and clearly when


212
0:8:42,27 --> 0:8:43,789
you are walking away from me.


213
0:8:43,789 --> 0:8:46,5
I will use this as
experience to hold it


214
0:8:46,5 --> 0:8:48,21
against the next
pretty sucker who


215
0:8:48,21 --> 0:8:50,39
marches his pretty
little face my way.


216
0:8:50,39 --> 0:8:51,94
Pray for him, birds.


217
0:8:51,94 --> 0:8:54,45
Let's hope that
one gets out alive.


218
0:8:54,45 --> 0:8:57,38
Alert the others
that I lust like war.


219
0:8:57,38 --> 0:9:0,95
I know how to snap next, swallow
nails, and flirt like Medusa.


220
0:9:0,95 --> 0:9:1,79
Be forewarned.


221
0:9:1,79 --> 0:9:6,1
I'm a maneater who is
developing serious hunger pains.


222
0:9:6,1 --> 0:9:9,39
I do not need to say
or believe a thing.


223
0:9:9,39 --> 0:9:11,5
You are no blacksmith.


224
0:9:11,5 --> 0:9:12,78
You are no lumberjack.


225
0:9:12,78 --> 0:9:15,7
Everything you leave
is made out of sugar.


226
0:9:15,7 --> 0:9:18,1
This will all crumble
with one lick.


227
0:9:18,1 --> 0:9:21,35
Maybe it's my fault I
wear tap shoes to bed.


228
0:9:21,35 --> 0:9:24,12
I like a good entrance,
and I hate silence.


229
0:9:24,12 --> 0:9:27,75
I have a soft spot for hip bones
and I love with escape in mind.


230
0:9:27,75 --> 0:9:30,76
Maybe it's my fault that
I care with too many keys,


231
0:9:30,76 --> 0:9:32,55
that I stain every
lover with rust


232
0:9:32,55 --> 0:9:34,5
because if I can't
be beautiful, I


233
0:9:34,5 --> 0:9:37,93
make sure no one else
around me is either.


234
0:9:37,93 --> 0:9:39,67
I'm not bitter.


235
0:9:39,67 --> 0:9:41,74
I'm just being a man about it.


236
0:9:41,74 --> 0:9:44,47
No kissing, not trapping
myself in situations


237
0:9:44,47 --> 0:9:46,42
I can't charm my way out.


238
0:9:46,42 --> 0:9:48,35
I take after my mother.


239
0:9:48,35 --> 0:9:50,34
I'm also take after winter.


240
0:9:50,34 --> 0:9:51,84
I'm so cold.


241
0:9:51,84 --> 0:9:54,1
I promised to leave
quiet this time,


242
0:9:54,1 --> 0:9:57,19
just leave a sweaty palm
print on your door handle.


243
0:9:57,19 --> 0:10:1,91
Boys, how can you not love a
girl with a good exit strategy.


244
0:10:1,91 --> 0:10:3,35
Thank you.


245
0:10:3,35 --> 0:10:5,17
So yay!


246
0:10:5,17 --> 0:10:5,75
Cue cards!


247
0:10:5,75 --> 0:10:6,88
Where's my cue cards?


248
0:10:6,88 --> 0:10:9,2
I need those.


249
0:10:9,2 --> 0:10:12,31
So the thing I really love
about poetry in particular


250
0:10:12,31 --> 0:10:15,5
is that it's just such
a great way to express.


251
0:10:15,5 --> 0:10:17,32
Usually people always
think that like with poetry


252
0:10:17,32 --> 0:10:20,68
it either needs to rhyme or
needs to be this or that one,


253
0:10:20,68 --> 0:10:23,47
when in all honesty, it
can be whatever you want.


254
0:10:23,47 --> 0:10:25,43
It really can surely
come from anywhere


255
0:10:25,43 --> 0:10:27,912
of sensitive inspiration.


256
0:10:27,912 --> 0:10:29,87
One of the things I really
wanted to talk about


257
0:10:29,87 --> 0:10:33,29
is this whole concept of
digital versus analog.


258
0:10:33,29 --> 0:10:35,93
So me as a writer and
me as like a poet,


259
0:10:35,93 --> 0:10:38,62
which is kind of a dying art,
or like, people are always like,


260
0:10:38,62 --> 0:10:39,12
oh!


261
0:10:39,12 --> 0:10:40,578
When they find out
I'm a poet, they


262
0:10:40,578 --> 0:10:42,34
ask me like three questions.


263
0:10:42,34 --> 0:10:45,45
First one is where
can I read your stuff?


264
0:10:45,45 --> 0:10:46,73
I hate that question.


265
0:10:46,73 --> 0:10:48,73
Because this was like
before I became published.


266
0:10:48,73 --> 0:10:52,51
I was just like you're going
to hear it at a poetry slam.


267
0:10:52,51 --> 0:10:55,532
And then the second one
is why are you a poet,


268
0:10:55,532 --> 0:10:57,24
which I don't think
I need to explain it.


269
0:10:57,24 --> 0:10:58,49
It just kind of happened.


270
0:10:58,49 --> 0:11:0,22
And then the third
and final one is, so


271
0:11:0,22 --> 0:11:1,73
what do you do for money?


272
0:11:1,73 --> 0:11:2,23
Right?


273
0:11:2,23 --> 0:11:7,454
So I realized that that's like
a really difficult thing to do.


274
0:11:7,454 --> 0:11:8,12
Let's be honest.


275
0:11:8,12 --> 0:11:9,22
We all want money.


276
0:11:9,22 --> 0:11:11,61
We all want to get paid
for our art and everything.


277
0:11:11,61 --> 0:11:13,7
But it's a sacrifice
that you make,


278
0:11:13,7 --> 0:11:15,862
because you just love doing it.


279
0:11:15,862 --> 0:11:17,99
So, as a writer,
I always am told


280
0:11:17,99 --> 0:11:19,99
that I am like a crazy
person, because I


281
0:11:19,99 --> 0:11:23,7
have to physically
write down every poem.


282
0:11:23,7 --> 0:11:25,83
I can't just type it.


283
0:11:25,83 --> 0:11:30,52
I have a very, very severe
and special form of dyslexia,


284
0:11:30,52 --> 0:11:34,38
where I can't see vowels at all.


285
0:11:34,38 --> 0:11:37,1
It's a very strange
form of dyslexia.


286
0:11:37,1 --> 0:11:37,74
It's very rare.


287
0:11:37,74 --> 0:11:42,5
So for me, when I write, it's
kind in this special language


288
0:11:42,5 --> 0:11:43,985
that no one else
can really read,


289
0:11:43,985 --> 0:11:45,36
because it's all
chicken scratch.


290
0:11:45,36 --> 0:11:47,2
And like there's no
vowels in my words


291
0:11:47,2 --> 0:11:49,97
pretty much, which I
used to worry about,


292
0:11:49,97 --> 0:11:52,41
like so people are always
like why do you keep a diary?


293
0:11:52,41 --> 0:11:53,377
What if you lose it?


294
0:11:53,377 --> 0:11:54,96
It's like good luck
trying to read it.


295
0:11:54,96 --> 0:11:56,5
There's that episode of Doug.


296
0:11:56,5 --> 0:11:58,541
I don't know if anyone
remembers that show, Doug,


297
0:11:58,541 --> 0:12:0,46
where Doug loses his journal.


298
0:12:0,46 --> 0:12:2,7
And his arch nemesis,
Roger finds i.


299
0:12:2,7 --> 0:12:4,799
And he's worried that
Roger's going to read it.


300
0:12:4,799 --> 0:12:6,9
And Roger gives it back to him.


301
0:12:6,9 --> 0:12:7,27
And he's like it's
chicken scratch.


302
0:12:7,27 --> 0:12:8,57
You're able to read this.


303
0:12:8,57 --> 0:12:12,32
And it's like, ah man, that just
made me feel so much better.


304
0:12:12,32 --> 0:12:14,8
So for me, it's all
about the concept


305
0:12:14,8 --> 0:12:16,41
that, like, when you're
stuck in a situation


306
0:12:16,41 --> 0:12:18,42
or you find yourself in
front of the computer,


307
0:12:18,42 --> 0:12:20,17
I always find myself
procrastinating more.


308
0:12:20,17 --> 0:12:23,676
Like I find myself
so highly distracted


309
0:12:23,676 --> 0:12:24,8
by everything and anything.


310
0:12:24,8 --> 0:12:26,17
You know, all of a
sudden, I'm on Twitter.


311
0:12:26,17 --> 0:12:27,545
All of a sudden,
I'm on Facebook.


312
0:12:27,545 --> 0:12:29,882
All of a sudden, I'm
googling myself, whatever.


313
0:12:29,882 --> 0:12:31,34
But when you have
a piece of paper,


314
0:12:31,34 --> 0:12:33,78
you just kind of
forget how epically


315
0:12:33,78 --> 0:12:38,56
organic that is, to literally
see the word on the page, just


316
0:12:38,56 --> 0:12:41,94
pressed and archived for
your own personal advantage.


317
0:12:41,94 --> 0:12:43,88
And I realize in
this day and age,


318
0:12:43,88 --> 0:12:46,734
why keep a journal if no
one's going to read it.


319
0:12:46,734 --> 0:12:48,4
But that's the thing
is you need to keep


320
0:12:48,4 --> 0:12:50,0
a journal because no
one's going to read it.


321
0:12:50,0 --> 0:12:52,34
I know this is like the
generation where you literally


322
0:12:52,34 --> 0:12:54,44
put up, like, I had
the best tuna fish


323
0:12:54,44 --> 0:12:56,67
sandwich ever on Twitter, right?


324
0:12:56,67 --> 0:12:59,19
But not everyone
needs to know that.


325
0:12:59,19 --> 0:13:1,15
I'm sorry, that stuff
always bothers me.


326
0:13:1,15 --> 0:13:3,5
You need to tell people I'm
going to talk at Google.


327
0:13:3,5 --> 0:13:6,31
That's the stuff they
like on Facebook.


328
0:13:6,31 --> 0:13:7,9
But so my whole
thing is that you


329
0:13:7,9 --> 0:13:10,93
have to go back to the page.


330
0:13:10,93 --> 0:13:12,56
It's really difficult
and really hard.


331
0:13:12,56 --> 0:13:15,8
And as a poet, you
go back to the page,


332
0:13:15,8 --> 0:13:18,9
and then you kind of bring
it back to the stage.


333
0:13:18,9 --> 0:13:23,67
That was so cheesy,
but really epic.


334
0:13:23,67 --> 0:13:25,82
So with that I'll
give you another poem.


335
0:13:25,82 --> 0:13:26,32
See?


336
0:13:26,32 --> 0:13:28,53
I got all nervous, and then
I'm going to do a poem.


337
0:13:28,53 --> 0:13:30,405
And then I'm not going
to be nervous anymore.


338
0:13:30,405 --> 0:13:31,55
It's going great.


339
0:13:31,55 --> 0:13:33,7
This is a good
choice of an outfit.


340
0:13:33,7 --> 0:13:36,2
I went through like three
different choices today.


341
0:13:36,2 --> 0:13:38,52
And I just think this one's
really epic and awesome.


342
0:13:38,52 --> 0:13:40,4
[? Uniglo, ?] you
should do my wardrobe.


343
0:13:40,4 --> 0:13:42,5
That was a really bad shout out.


344
0:13:42,5 --> 0:13:42,88
That was fun.


345
0:13:42,88 --> 0:13:43,565
Here's a poem.


346
0:13:43,565 --> 0:13:49,24



347
0:13:49,24 --> 0:13:52,19
One in a million.


348
0:13:52,19 --> 0:13:55,29
That's how many people have your
reading disability, Roseanne.


349
0:13:55,29 --> 0:13:57,832
One in a million.


350
0:13:57,832 --> 0:13:59,54
That's what the
well-paid doctor told me.


351
0:13:59,54 --> 0:14:3,65
But don't worry, he
said, you're not alone.


352
0:14:3,65 --> 0:14:4,38
Wait, hold up.


353
0:14:4,38 --> 0:14:7,707
One in a million
and I'm not alone?


354
0:14:7,707 --> 0:14:9,29
That make as much
sense as this mumble


355
0:14:9,29 --> 0:14:10,62
jumble they call an alphabet.


356
0:14:10,62 --> 0:14:14,18
A-E-I-O-U and sometimes Y. See?


357
0:14:14,18 --> 0:14:16,4
I didn't know these
letters were special,


358
0:14:16,4 --> 0:14:19,62
and that these letters were
going to make me special.


359
0:14:19,62 --> 0:14:21,797
But I can't recognize vowels.


360
0:14:21,797 --> 0:14:24,38
And those little perks like to
play word games up, down, left,


361
0:14:24,38 --> 0:14:26,463
right, vertical, cross the
page, like chess pieces


362
0:14:26,463 --> 0:14:27,92
in a never-ending board game.


363
0:14:27,92 --> 0:14:28,85
See, I don't know
what you learned.


364
0:14:28,85 --> 0:14:31,3
But I learned E came before
I. If it didn't, then


365
0:14:31,3 --> 0:14:37,54
they should have rearranged the
alphabet as I E F G T K X 7 4.


366
0:14:37,54 --> 0:14:38,17
Ah, screw it.


367
0:14:38,17 --> 0:14:40,4
You got me memorizing that
thing, like it's worth it.


368
0:14:40,4 --> 0:14:42,82
I think spelling
altogether is preposterous.


369
0:14:42,82 --> 0:14:43,71
Preposterous.


370
0:14:43,71 --> 0:14:47,3
P-O-S-T-E-Z-R-N. Preposterous.


371
0:14:47,3 --> 0:14:49,64
OK, so maybe my
spelling's a little off.


372
0:14:49,64 --> 0:14:51,5
But have you ever
studied English spelling?


373
0:14:51,5 --> 0:14:53,118
I mean, take the
word drunkenness.


374
0:14:53,118 --> 0:14:54,76
D-R-U-N-K-E-N-N-E-S-S-.


375
0:14:54,76 --> 0:14:57,35



376
0:14:57,35 --> 0:14:59,63
A drunk came up
with the spelling.


377
0:14:59,63 --> 0:15:2,33
I know this, because A, there's
not enough thought put into it,


378
0:15:2,33 --> 0:15:4,11
and B, there's too many Ns.


379
0:15:4,11 --> 0:15:7,23
And well, drunks never
know when to end.


380
0:15:7,23 --> 0:15:9,87
There's an L in salmon.


381
0:15:9,87 --> 0:15:11,73
Why the hell is
there an L in salmon?


382
0:15:11,73 --> 0:15:13,48
Now you got my ears
[INAUDIBLE] riverbeds,


383
0:15:13,48 --> 0:15:15,102
trying to hear that salmon.


384
0:15:15,102 --> 0:15:16,56
And all I'm doing
is hitting walls.


385
0:15:16,56 --> 0:15:18,18
And all I got to
say for it is damn.


386
0:15:18,18 --> 0:15:21,495
A-E-I-O-U and sometimes
I ask myself Y.


387
0:15:21,495 --> 0:15:24,91
See, bullies used to hold books
over my head yelling spell


388
0:15:24,91 --> 0:15:25,41
it, Rose.


389
0:15:25,41 --> 0:15:26,65
Spell it and you'll get it.


390
0:15:26,65 --> 0:15:29,84
I was put in exile ever
from going near a library.


391
0:15:29,84 --> 0:15:31,79
First, I blamed in on my pencil.


392
0:15:31,79 --> 0:15:35,2
It seemed to be holding
everyone else's words just fine.


393
0:15:35,2 --> 0:15:38,49
I cursed each one I picked
up, spelling it wrong again


394
0:15:38,49 --> 0:15:40,69
and again and again.


395
0:15:40,69 --> 0:15:44,1
Until the paper was nothing
but pinks marks and my eraser


396
0:15:44,1 --> 0:15:47,46
had crumbled down like a
watered-down tumbleweed.


397
0:15:47,46 --> 0:15:51,23
See, the brain is
like a window sill.


398
0:15:51,23 --> 0:15:55,29
Outside, stage left,
there's an apple tree.


399
0:15:55,29 --> 0:15:57,2
Replace those
apples with letters.


400
0:15:57,2 --> 0:15:58,95
And when someone
approaches you and asks


401
0:15:58,95 --> 0:16:2,8
you to spell something, you
can reach outside your window,


402
0:16:2,8 --> 0:16:4,4
grab the letters
needed, and then look,


403
0:16:4,4 --> 0:16:5,95
you have the word predictable.


404
0:16:5,95 --> 0:16:8,3
Well, aren't you so smart.


405
0:16:8,3 --> 0:16:14,13
See, my window is a lot
smaller and really dirty.


406
0:16:14,13 --> 0:16:17,4
And my apple tree is
kind of dying and wilted


407
0:16:17,4 --> 0:16:18,4
in the distance.


408
0:16:18,4 --> 0:16:20,26
So when I do reach
for letters, I


409
0:16:20,26 --> 0:16:23,44
bring up nothing but
sawdust and paint chips.


410
0:16:23,44 --> 0:16:24,611
So do it.


411
0:16:24,611 --> 0:16:26,11
Prick me again with
one of those Ns,


412
0:16:26,11 --> 0:16:27,7
let me pour lemon
juice in my wounds.


413
0:16:27,7 --> 0:16:28,835
Watch me shrivel
up like a slug I


414
0:16:28,835 --> 0:16:30,22
used to torture on
boring summer day.


415
0:16:30,22 --> 0:16:31,9
And when September
comes, I am nothing


416
0:16:31,9 --> 0:16:33,8
but a ghostwriter
writing in invisible ink.


417
0:16:33,8 --> 0:16:35,62
See my writing was fine.


418
0:16:35,62 --> 0:16:37,65
The spelling was
being held against me.


419
0:16:37,65 --> 0:16:39,79
I had great placements
for nouns, adverbs,


420
0:16:39,79 --> 0:16:41,62
and I can braise
some veal-- I got


421
0:16:41,62 --> 0:16:43,74
elegant adjective-- with ease.


422
0:16:43,74 --> 0:16:46,44
I filled with tears
inside in spelling bee.


423
0:16:46,44 --> 0:16:48,24
And this is my
apology to anyone who


424
0:16:48,24 --> 0:16:50,3
says I can't be a poet because
I don't know how to spell.


425
0:16:50,3 --> 0:16:50,83
Well, guess what?


426
0:16:50,83 --> 0:16:51,37
You're wrong.


427
0:16:51,37 --> 0:16:53,12
Because not only do I
write, I was a spit.


428
0:16:53,12 --> 0:16:55,85
And I spit nothing but fire,
so call yourself cremated.


429
0:16:55,85 --> 0:16:58,23
Yes, I do have my obstacles.


430
0:16:58,23 --> 0:17:3,67
A-E-I-O-U, and sometimes
even Y. But as you can see,


431
0:17:3,67 --> 0:17:5,49
they haven't stopped me yet.


432
0:17:5,49 --> 0:17:5,596
Thank you.


433
0:17:5,596 --> 0:17:6,429
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]


434
0:17:6,429 --> 0:17:7,81
ROSE McALEESE: Whoo!


435
0:17:7,81 --> 0:17:10,839
She goes off stage!


436
0:17:10,839 --> 0:17:14,97
Wait, I have props.


437
0:17:14,97 --> 0:17:16,68
I'm going to do a magic trick.


438
0:17:16,68 --> 0:17:18,43
Can I come from the--
oh, I can't come up!


439
0:17:18,43 --> 0:17:19,555
I was going to try come up.


440
0:17:19,555 --> 0:17:21,41
This is Pippo.


441
0:17:21,41 --> 0:17:24,4
He's famous.


442
0:17:24,4 --> 0:17:25,2
Ah, man.


443
0:17:25,2 --> 0:17:25,78
He's drunk.


444
0:17:25,78 --> 0:17:27,27
He's a little drunk monkey.


445
0:17:27,27 --> 0:17:31,37
I got Pippo when I
was three years old.


446
0:17:31,37 --> 0:17:34,42
Him and I have the same
birthday, which is Halloween.


447
0:17:34,42 --> 0:17:38,55
And he's, like, literally
my most prized possession,


448
0:17:38,55 --> 0:17:41,93
which is so weird
for most people.


449
0:17:41,93 --> 0:17:44,5
But he's the man.


450
0:17:44,5 --> 0:17:47,69
He has to share a bed with me.


451
0:17:47,69 --> 0:17:48,45
And he's awesome.


452
0:17:48,45 --> 0:17:50,2
But the reason why I'm
talking about Pippo


453
0:17:50,2 --> 0:17:52,2
is because-- so
this whole concept


454
0:17:52,2 --> 0:17:53,36
of going back to the notebooks.


455
0:17:53,36 --> 0:17:57,0
So I always have a notebook
with me, like everywhere I go.


456
0:17:57,0 --> 0:18:2,16
Every jacket of mine has a
little tiny notebook and a pen.


457
0:18:2,16 --> 0:18:4,79
I can't be somewhere
if I can't write.


458
0:18:4,79 --> 0:18:9,52
You see artists all
the time that they're


459
0:18:9,52 --> 0:18:11,29
doing imprints or
drawing or whatever


460
0:18:11,29 --> 0:18:13,593
on a napkin or the
back of a ticket stub.


461
0:18:13,593 --> 0:18:15,9
I'm that way.


462
0:18:15,9 --> 0:18:18,7
I literally have millions and
millions of these notebooks.


463
0:18:18,7 --> 0:18:21,77
And most notebooks
represent about six months.


464
0:18:21,77 --> 0:18:25,5
And then I move on to the next
one and so on and so forth.


465
0:18:25,5 --> 0:18:27,42
So one of the things
that I basically


466
0:18:27,42 --> 0:18:28,889
wanted to have
this talk about is


467
0:18:28,889 --> 0:18:30,93
that like when you're
stuck in a situation that's


468
0:18:30,93 --> 0:18:34,4
extremely difficult
with dealing with life,


469
0:18:34,4 --> 0:18:37,69
it's always good to go back to
the page and writing it out.


470
0:18:37,69 --> 0:18:40,495
And one of my favorite things
to do is write out lists.


471
0:18:40,495 --> 0:18:42,37
So I'm going to read
you guys some of my list


472
0:18:42,37 --> 0:18:44,7
from my notebook, which
is kind of like not


473
0:18:44,7 --> 0:18:47,9
my point, because my point is
to keep it in the notebook.


474
0:18:47,9 --> 0:18:49,57
But let's just pretend you
guys are in my bedroom.


475
0:18:49,57 --> 0:18:52,47
And I practiced this Google
Talk in my bedroom one too


476
0:18:52,47 --> 0:18:53,2
many times.


477
0:18:53,2 --> 0:18:55,5
He had to listen to it.


478
0:18:55,5 --> 0:18:57,96
So these are things that
I believe to be true.


479
0:18:57,96 --> 0:18:58,85
OK?


480
0:18:58,85 --> 0:19:1,34
Pigeons don't die.


481
0:19:1,34 --> 0:19:4,0
Has anyone seen a baby pigeon?


482
0:19:4,0 --> 0:19:4,77
Exactly.


483
0:19:4,77 --> 0:19:5,62
They don't die.


484
0:19:5,62 --> 0:19:9,12
Pigeons have been here
since the beginning.


485
0:19:9,12 --> 0:19:11,519
I also believe that I was
going to marry Sam Cooke.


486
0:19:11,519 --> 0:19:12,56
Then I found out he died.


487
0:19:12,56 --> 0:19:14,58
And then I told my mom I
was going to marry my dad.


488
0:19:14,58 --> 0:19:16,579
And my mom was like [SNORT]
good luck with that.


489
0:19:16,579 --> 0:19:17,8
So that's bad.


490
0:19:17,8 --> 0:19:20,53
I think spelling is stupid.


491
0:19:20,53 --> 0:19:22,83
The best moments are
never caught on film.


492
0:19:22,83 --> 0:19:24,6
I met Dave Chapelle once.


493
0:19:24,6 --> 0:19:27,882
No one believes me, because
I didn't Instagram it.


494
0:19:27,882 --> 0:19:29,34
I think "Clueless"
and "Mean Girls"


495
0:19:29,34 --> 0:19:31,92
are the funniest movies ever.


496
0:19:31,92 --> 0:19:34,17
You cannot debate me on that.


497
0:19:34,17 --> 0:19:34,99
I'm sorry.


498
0:19:34,99 --> 0:19:37,61
I've had many arguments
with friends being like, no.


499
0:19:37,61 --> 0:19:39,46
"Clueless" and "Mean Girls."


500
0:19:39,46 --> 0:19:40,97
On Wednesdays, we wear pink.


501
0:19:40,97 --> 0:19:41,84
Is today Wednesday?


502
0:19:41,84 --> 0:19:42,42
No, it's not.


503
0:19:42,42 --> 0:19:43,62
OK, never mind.


504
0:19:43,62 --> 0:19:46,69
I also think that
Beyonce is a unicorn.


505
0:19:46,69 --> 0:19:47,87
She's amazing.


506
0:19:47,87 --> 0:19:49,51
I also believe that
writing things down


507
0:19:49,51 --> 0:19:51,28
is better than typing them out.


508
0:19:51,28 --> 0:19:53,55
I also believe that
the power of good art


509
0:19:53,55 --> 0:19:55,88
and the power of bad art.


510
0:19:55,88 --> 0:19:57,0
Here's my bucket list.


511
0:19:57,0 --> 0:19:59,5
First of all, I hate
the word bucket list.


512
0:19:59,5 --> 0:20:1,28
It just sounds so
stupid and dirty.


513
0:20:1,28 --> 0:20:3,1
Like bucket is just
a dirty word to me.


514
0:20:3,1 --> 0:20:6,474
So this is my to do list,
which sounds even dirtier, now


515
0:20:6,474 --> 0:20:7,14
that you say it.


516
0:20:7,14 --> 0:20:8,4
Like, "to do."


517
0:20:8,4 --> 0:20:8,84
Anyways.


518
0:20:8,84 --> 0:20:12,27
So this is what I want
to do for my to-do list.


519
0:20:12,27 --> 0:20:15,12
I'd like to move out
of my roommate's house.


520
0:20:15,12 --> 0:20:18,77
Fun fact, since I am a poet, I
live with this elderly couple.


521
0:20:18,77 --> 0:20:20,27
They're great.


522
0:20:20,27 --> 0:20:21,97
I call them Mom and Dad.


523
0:20:21,97 --> 0:20:22,67
They're nice.


524
0:20:22,67 --> 0:20:24,878
They're not freaked out that
I call them Mom and Dad,


525
0:20:24,878 --> 0:20:27,25
because I'm been calling
them that my whole life.


526
0:20:27,25 --> 0:20:27,85
Anyways.


527
0:20:27,85 --> 0:20:28,59
OK.


528
0:20:28,59 --> 0:20:30,67
I would like to
write a screenplay.


529
0:20:30,67 --> 0:20:32,87
I would also like to find
out what Bill Murray says


530
0:20:32,87 --> 0:20:35,37
at the end of "Lost
in Translation"


531
0:20:35,37 --> 0:20:37,67
to Scarlett Johannsen.


532
0:20:37,67 --> 0:20:41,17
I would like to find the
perfect voice for Pippo.


533
0:20:41,17 --> 0:20:44,47
I want to do like a Lifetime
web series of just my life,


534
0:20:44,47 --> 0:20:46,68
because I think I'm cool enough.


535
0:20:46,68 --> 0:20:47,86
And Pippo needs a voice.


536
0:20:47,86 --> 0:20:48,86
But I don't know
what he sounds like,


537
0:20:48,86 --> 0:20:49,49
so I'm up for suggestions.


538
0:20:49,49 --> 0:20:51,24
You can look at him
and examine him.


539
0:20:51,24 --> 0:20:53,53
I think British, but I'm Irish.


540
0:20:53,53 --> 0:20:55,549
So why are you British?


541
0:20:55,549 --> 0:20:56,9
I don't know.


542
0:20:56,9 --> 0:20:57,715
So if you can think
of a name for him--


543
0:20:57,715 --> 0:21:0,72
I actually want to listen
to Dr. Dre's "Detox."


544
0:21:0,72 --> 0:21:1,47
It's like Beyonce.


545
0:21:1,47 --> 0:21:2,28
It's a unicorn.


546
0:21:2,28 --> 0:21:4,29
I don't know if it's
actually going to come out.


547
0:21:4,29 --> 0:21:8,33
I want to befriend a girl
named Becky really badly,


548
0:21:8,33 --> 0:21:11,14
so I can be like "Becky,
look at her butt."


549
0:21:11,14 --> 0:21:14,25
I also want to
find a baby pigeon.


550
0:21:14,25 --> 0:21:15,9
I want to be on "SNL."


551
0:21:15,9 --> 0:21:17,97
So here's my "SNL"
moment, you guys.


552
0:21:17,97 --> 0:21:19,76
I'm going to use
this Google Talk.


553
0:21:19,76 --> 0:21:23,11
Lorne Michaels, if you're
out there, or Maya Rudolph,


554
0:21:23,11 --> 0:21:24,54
I really want to be on "SNL."


555
0:21:24,54 --> 0:21:26,32
Like, it kind of
disgusting how badly


556
0:21:26,32 --> 0:21:27,51
I want to be on this show.


557
0:21:27,51 --> 0:21:31,295
So I realize in my "SNL"
-like working things out,


558
0:21:31,295 --> 0:21:32,92
there are two types
of people in "SNL."


559
0:21:32,92 --> 0:21:34,94
This all has to
do with something.


560
0:21:34,94 --> 0:21:37,38
OK, I promise this will have
a good conclusion at the end.


561
0:21:37,38 --> 0:21:37,95
I hope.


562
0:21:37,95 --> 0:21:40,21
Anyways, two things
about "SNL" people.


563
0:21:40,21 --> 0:21:41,619
You're either a
character person,


564
0:21:41,619 --> 0:21:43,66
where you make up new
characters, like the Target


565
0:21:43,66 --> 0:21:45,55
Lady or Debbie Downer, all that.


566
0:21:45,55 --> 0:21:48,49
Or you're someone
who does impressions.


567
0:21:48,49 --> 0:21:50,85
I don't think I
can do impressions.


568
0:21:50,85 --> 0:21:52,93
But I have two impressions!


569
0:21:52,93 --> 0:21:55,12
Can I test them out
for you on you guys?


570
0:21:55,12 --> 0:21:56,55
Can I?


571
0:21:56,55 --> 0:21:58,87
There are people in this
audience, I promise, YouTube.


572
0:21:58,87 --> 0:22:0,73
OK, so here's my
two impressions.


573
0:22:0,73 --> 0:22:1,23
OK?


574
0:22:1,23 --> 0:22:4,43
So, Obama.


575
0:22:4,43 --> 0:22:6,785
[EXHALES] I'm going to get here.


576
0:22:6,785 --> 0:22:9,16
(DEEP VOICE) Sasha,
Malia, go to bed.


577
0:22:9,16 --> 0:22:9,91
(NORMAL VOICE) OK.


578
0:22:9,91 --> 0:22:12,429
Now here's my Yogi
Bear impression.


579
0:22:12,429 --> 0:22:13,97
(DEEP VOICE) Sasha,
Malia, go to bed.


580
0:22:13,97 --> 0:22:14,803
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]


581
0:22:14,803 --> 0:22:16,59
ROSE McALEESE: They're
the same person!


582
0:22:16,59 --> 0:22:17,897
Anyways, OK.


583
0:22:17,897 --> 0:22:19,23
Sorry, that was my "SNL" moment.


584
0:22:19,23 --> 0:22:22,0



585
0:22:22,0 --> 0:22:24,5
Also, moving on.


586
0:22:24,5 --> 0:22:28,1
So basically I'm working on
like nine different projects


587
0:22:28,1 --> 0:22:31,7
right now that have nothing
to do with my art, which


588
0:22:31,7 --> 0:22:33,61
really bums me out and
really makes me sad,


589
0:22:33,61 --> 0:22:34,56
because I actually
have to do things


590
0:22:34,56 --> 0:22:40,46
that I will pay my nonrent
to my nonroommates.


591
0:22:40,46 --> 0:22:43,8
But every time I make a list,
I always feel like I'm writing,


592
0:22:43,8 --> 0:22:47,3
that I'm an actual writer, that
I'm actually doing something


593
0:22:47,3 --> 0:22:49,485
that matters, because
it impresses myself


594
0:22:49,485 --> 0:22:51,77
and it impresses Pippo,
and at the end of the day,


595
0:22:51,77 --> 0:22:53,59
it makes me happy.


596
0:22:53,59 --> 0:22:57,1
So one of the last lists
I wrote is things I hate.


597
0:22:57,1 --> 0:23:2,305
Dentists, bananas, snow,
split sinks-- you know,


598
0:23:2,305 --> 0:23:3,93
when they have one
faucet for hot water


599
0:23:3,93 --> 0:23:5,179
and one faucet for cold water.


600
0:23:5,179 --> 0:23:5,74
I hate that.


601
0:23:5,74 --> 0:23:8,6
Which one do you use?


602
0:23:8,6 --> 0:23:11,5
Being told that I'm too much,
too passionate, too churned-up,


603
0:23:11,5 --> 0:23:12,35
or too excited.


604
0:23:12,35 --> 0:23:13,84
I hate flying.


605
0:23:13,84 --> 0:23:16,19
I hate how easily
stressed I get.


606
0:23:16,19 --> 0:23:20,34
I hate how no one experiences
paper cuts anymore,


607
0:23:20,34 --> 0:23:24,206
because in this digital age,
no one reads books that often.


608
0:23:24,206 --> 0:23:25,8
You know what I mean?


609
0:23:25,8 --> 0:23:26,37
It's always on something.


610
0:23:26,37 --> 0:23:27,81
This is the
generation-- actually,


611
0:23:27,81 --> 0:23:29,83
you know what, that's
actually a good thing.


612
0:23:29,83 --> 0:23:32,52
Why am I hating off a paper--
no one wants paper clips.


613
0:23:32,52 --> 0:23:35,7
I think Google saved the paper
clip, if you think about it.


614
0:23:35,7 --> 0:23:36,24
The paper cut, I mean.


615
0:23:36,24 --> 0:23:37,823
Like you don't get
paper cuts anymore.


616
0:23:37,823 --> 0:23:39,755
You just Google search things.


617
0:23:39,755 --> 0:23:42,97
And I also hate buffering
on like Hulu videos.


618
0:23:42,97 --> 0:23:45,32
Can someone fix that?


619
0:23:45,32 --> 0:23:46,32
No one?


620
0:23:46,32 --> 0:23:47,17
OK, never mind.


621
0:23:47,17 --> 0:23:50,3
Anyways, so
basically my point is


622
0:23:50,3 --> 0:23:54,79
just that when everything
comes down to it,


623
0:23:54,79 --> 0:23:56,86
the paper and the
pen are literally


624
0:23:56,86 --> 0:23:59,38
the most mightiest
things in the world.


625
0:23:59,38 --> 0:24:3,27
I am in this really weird
purgatory stage in my life


626
0:24:3,27 --> 0:24:5,64
where I don't know
exactly what I'm doing.


627
0:24:5,64 --> 0:24:8,44
Like I can't even believe
that I'm here right now.


628
0:24:8,44 --> 0:24:12,11
But I think it just has to do
with I literally write letters


629
0:24:12,11 --> 0:24:13,3
to the universe.


630
0:24:13,3 --> 0:24:15,61
And then I just kind of press
it together in my notebook


631
0:24:15,61 --> 0:24:19,92
and hope that someday, someone
reads it, if not in the cosmos


632
0:24:19,92 --> 0:24:20,93
or whatever.


633
0:24:20,93 --> 0:24:24,49
So it's just like go
back to actual writing.


634
0:24:24,49 --> 0:24:26,97
I mean picking up a pen
is such a heavy act,


635
0:24:26,97 --> 0:24:30,67
but it does so much.


636
0:24:30,67 --> 0:24:32,27
So now I'm nervous again.


637
0:24:32,27 --> 0:24:33,83
So I'm going to do another poem.


638
0:24:33,83 --> 0:24:35,81
This is easy.


639
0:24:35,81 --> 0:24:38,134
Rappers don't really talk
between their songs, do they?


640
0:24:38,134 --> 0:24:39,8
They just kind of go
into the next song.


641
0:24:39,8 --> 0:24:41,25
They're horrible
public speakers.


642
0:24:41,25 --> 0:24:43,124
I think rappers are
horrible public speakers.


643
0:24:43,124 --> 0:24:45,577
That's a secret.


644
0:24:45,577 --> 0:24:47,16
But then again, I
want to be a rapper.


645
0:24:47,16 --> 0:24:50,51
I already have four
rap names-- Rose Gold,


646
0:24:50,51 --> 0:24:53,82
Rosetta Stone, and
Rose Bowl, which


647
0:24:53,82 --> 0:24:55,9
is like if I ever become
like a high rapper.


648
0:24:55,9 --> 0:24:56,89
But I don't smoke weed.


649
0:24:56,89 --> 0:24:59,42
So, never mind.


650
0:24:59,42 --> 0:25:1,22
More poems.


651
0:25:1,22 --> 0:25:10,73
[EXHALES]


652
0:25:10,73 --> 0:25:14,73
James Brown steps on stage.


653
0:25:14,73 --> 0:25:18,27
He is carved from
midnight's marble.


654
0:25:18,27 --> 0:25:22,54
He turns to his right hand
man, Clyde Funky Drummer


655
0:25:22,54 --> 0:25:25,675
Stubblefield and says, kick
a little, Clemen-clyde.


656
0:25:25,675 --> 0:25:29,49
Clyde, bursting from
his love and joy, all


657
0:25:29,49 --> 0:25:33,58
that is rhythm and blues,
beats the drums with such ease


658
0:25:33,58 --> 0:25:38,58
like God told him to play like
he was God playing the drums.


659
0:25:38,58 --> 0:25:41,9
The sound that came out
was pure, cold sweat.


660
0:25:41,9 --> 0:25:42,78
It's flesh.


661
0:25:42,78 --> 0:25:44,92
We're naked around the arena.


662
0:25:44,92 --> 0:25:46,862
A classic in the making.


663
0:25:46,862 --> 0:25:48,32
The record skips,
the record skips,


664
0:25:48,32 --> 0:25:51,93
the record skips a few years,
and hip hop shows up late


665
0:25:51,93 --> 0:25:53,88
but looks good.


666
0:25:53,88 --> 0:25:56,34
Does not make eye contact
with anyone in the room,


667
0:25:56,34 --> 0:25:57,2
afraid someone might notice.


668
0:25:57,2 --> 0:25:58,32
Um, excuse me.


669
0:25:58,32 --> 0:26:0,49
They're not from
around these parts.


670
0:26:0,49 --> 0:26:3,9
See hip hop was given
all the hand-me-downs,


671
0:26:3,9 --> 0:26:5,46
but learned to put swag
back in their stitches.


672
0:26:5,46 --> 0:26:7,87
Took what's not theirs
and made it their own.


673
0:26:7,87 --> 0:26:10,3
See, everything was
fine, until someone


674
0:26:10,3 --> 0:26:12,61
noticed the similarities
there once was.


675
0:26:12,61 --> 0:26:13,26
Hip hop.


676
0:26:13,26 --> 0:26:15,44
You kicked a little too
much dust off those records.


677
0:26:15,44 --> 0:26:18,95
Even Midas knows the price
you got to pay for the touch.


678
0:26:18,95 --> 0:26:21,81
The samples are not free.


679
0:26:21,81 --> 0:26:24,35
I would worry if I were
you, Mr. Biz Markie.


680
0:26:24,35 --> 0:26:28,84
In 2004, Brian Burton took the
JZ Black Album and the Beatles


681
0:26:28,84 --> 0:26:31,71
White Album and
made the Grey album.


682
0:26:31,71 --> 0:26:36,8
EMI, record companies, all of
a sudden feeling very cheated,


683
0:26:36,8 --> 0:26:38,86
decides to sue this nobody
for all that he's worth.


684
0:26:38,86 --> 0:26:41,71
This plan backfires, and
they pulled this lover,


685
0:26:41,71 --> 0:26:44,38
this fan of pure music
into the limelight for all


686
0:26:44,38 --> 0:26:46,28
to love and admire.


687
0:26:46,28 --> 0:26:50,76
The Beatles, angry about all
that has taken from them,


688
0:26:50,76 --> 0:26:53,26
have a song called
"Revolution #9"


689
0:26:53,26 --> 0:26:55,72
which is nine minutes of
remix, remix, remix, mastered


690
0:26:55,72 --> 0:26:56,68
in sounds.


691
0:26:56,68 --> 0:27:1,47
Andy Warhol can paint someone
else's photos and call it art.


692
0:27:1,47 --> 0:27:3,91
He even took a soup
can to stop himself


693
0:27:3,91 --> 0:27:6,37
from being a starving artist.


694
0:27:6,37 --> 0:27:10,51
Shakespeare took the framework
of a tragic Italian love story


695
0:27:10,51 --> 0:27:12,8
and slapped his name on it.


696
0:27:12,8 --> 0:27:16,68
Disney had the audacity to take
you your loved fairy tales,


697
0:27:16,68 --> 0:27:19,67
add some colors, re-animate
them, and walk to the bank,


698
0:27:19,67 --> 0:27:21,66
because well, this
generation know


699
0:27:21,66 --> 0:27:23,6
the best artists do not copy.


700
0:27:23,6 --> 0:27:24,78
They steal.


701
0:27:24,78 --> 0:27:27,8
And history is nothing
more than a 12-year boy


702
0:27:27,8 --> 0:27:30,18
with a serious (MOCK
STUTTER) stuttering problem,


703
0:27:30,18 --> 0:27:32,3
who's been told
one too many times


704
0:27:32,3 --> 0:27:34,35
to learn from your mistakes.


705
0:27:34,35 --> 0:27:38,206
It is one thing to pull
from your inspiration.


706
0:27:38,206 --> 0:27:42,19
It is another thing to be
the Man's tracing paper.


707
0:27:42,19 --> 0:27:47,61
As poets, as writers,
no, as humans, as humans,


708
0:27:47,61 --> 0:27:49,19
we sample all the time.


709
0:27:49,19 --> 0:27:50,84
Sample like ribcage.


710
0:27:50,84 --> 0:27:52,51
Advice your
grandmother once gave


711
0:27:52,51 --> 0:27:53,69
you are the weight of Atlas.


712
0:27:53,69 --> 0:27:54,76
Nothing is holy.


713
0:27:54,76 --> 0:27:55,57
Nothing is sacred.


714
0:27:55,57 --> 0:27:59,5
However, she'll be recognized
and respected and thanked.


715
0:27:59,5 --> 0:28:2,17
This evening, class,
Funky Drummer Stubblefield


716
0:28:2,17 --> 0:28:5,37
is doing me an honor of playing
my outro, a sample of all


717
0:28:5,37 --> 0:28:7,65
my favorite Kanye
West-- oop, sorry.


718
0:28:7,65 --> 0:28:10,5
Pardon me-- Frankenstein tunes.


719
0:28:10,5 --> 0:28:12,56
Clyde, whose own
original sound has


720
0:28:12,56 --> 0:28:17,46
been copied on 100 different
songs, has yet to see a penny.


721
0:28:17,46 --> 0:28:20,85
But for the record, he
wants nothing in return


722
0:28:20,85 --> 0:28:23,715
but a simple thank you.


723
0:28:23,715 --> 0:28:28,615
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]


724
0:28:28,615 --> 0:28:29,99
ROSE McALEESE:
Shake that monkey.


725
0:28:29,99 --> 0:28:30,63
That was inappropriate.


726
0:28:30,63 --> 0:28:31,425
Never mind.


727
0:28:31,425 --> 0:28:34,28



728
0:28:34,28 --> 0:28:39,81
Anyway, so yeah, being a writer.


729
0:28:39,81 --> 0:28:40,55
It's fun.


730
0:28:40,55 --> 0:28:42,8
It's interesting.


731
0:28:42,8 --> 0:28:46,8
It's been a very interesting
process, especially


732
0:28:46,8 --> 0:28:48,89
with becoming a teaching artist.


733
0:28:48,89 --> 0:28:50,21
I was horrible in school.


734
0:28:50,21 --> 0:28:51,78
I absolutely hated school.


735
0:28:51,78 --> 0:28:54,489
It was really difficult
for me, because I


736
0:28:54,489 --> 0:28:55,53
had a reading disability.


737
0:28:55,53 --> 0:28:58,14
And instead of trying
to actually have someone


738
0:28:58,14 --> 0:29:0,575
to pull me aside, and
explain to me what happened,


739
0:29:0,575 --> 0:29:1,95
they just threw
me in special ed,


740
0:29:1,95 --> 0:29:4,6
and were just like we're going
to just-- she sinks or swims,


741
0:29:4,6 --> 0:29:5,77
pretty much.


742
0:29:5,77 --> 0:29:8,1
So I've been going
back into schools


743
0:29:8,1 --> 0:29:11,89
and trying to help people
realize that everyone's special


744
0:29:11,89 --> 0:29:13,93
and everyone's unique
in their own way.


745
0:29:13,93 --> 0:29:15,97
And one of the writing
exercises that I


746
0:29:15,97 --> 0:29:18,46
do with my kids,
first-off, is I tell


747
0:29:18,46 --> 0:29:20,25
them to write a Pinky List.


748
0:29:20,25 --> 0:29:22,37
And a Pinky List
is a list of things


749
0:29:22,37 --> 0:29:26,352
that make you different
than the next person.


750
0:29:26,352 --> 0:29:27,81
So, for instance,
on my Pinky List,


751
0:29:27,81 --> 0:29:30,27
I would say like I'm
born on Halloween.


752
0:29:30,27 --> 0:29:32,76
I have a fear of bananas.


753
0:29:32,76 --> 0:29:35,53
My socks never match.


754
0:29:35,53 --> 0:29:37,934
And just all the weird stuff.


755
0:29:37,934 --> 0:29:39,6
There's so many-- why
can't I think of a


756
0:29:39,6 --> 0:29:41,44
in single weird thing
about me right now.


757
0:29:41,44 --> 0:29:43,46
But yeah, so basically,
one of things I do


758
0:29:43,46 --> 0:29:46,32
is do a Pinky List, which
is a great writing exercise.


759
0:29:46,32 --> 0:29:47,48
I love lists.


760
0:29:47,48 --> 0:29:49,32
I think that they
literally break down


761
0:29:49,32 --> 0:29:53,91
any situation or any problem you
have or face in everyday life.


762
0:29:53,91 --> 0:29:55,51
And I guess in this
whole thing that I


763
0:29:55,51 --> 0:29:58,49
want you guys to walk away
with is to just write.


764
0:29:58,49 --> 0:30:3,1
Journal out just to basically
just leave it on the page.


765
0:30:3,1 --> 0:30:4,66
I mean, I can't
stress that enough.


766
0:30:4,66 --> 0:30:10,8
It's just so epically
awesome, and it's really hard


767
0:30:10,8 --> 0:30:12,1
to just leave in your head.


768
0:30:12,1 --> 0:30:12,82
It just hurts.


769
0:30:12,82 --> 0:30:13,53
It really does.


770
0:30:13,53 --> 0:30:16,53
You just have to put it on
the page and figure it out.


771
0:30:16,53 --> 0:30:18,7
I also would like
to give you guys


772
0:30:18,7 --> 0:30:21,43
some writing prompts,
because I'm big on that.


773
0:30:21,43 --> 0:30:23,15
So one of them is to
make a Pinky List.


774
0:30:23,15 --> 0:30:24,89
You guys have
homework, and you're


775
0:30:24,89 --> 0:30:28,34
going to have to submit it to
me on Twitter in 140 characters


776
0:30:28,34 --> 0:30:29,4
or less.


777
0:30:29,4 --> 0:30:32,5
So one of the ones I
have is the Pinky List.


778
0:30:32,5 --> 0:30:36,19
Another one that I have,
one of y favorite writing


779
0:30:36,19 --> 0:30:38,16
prompts that I do with
my high school kids


780
0:30:38,16 --> 0:30:41,8
is "Things My Ex
Would Have Said."


781
0:30:41,8 --> 0:30:41,889
They love that one.


782
0:30:41,889 --> 0:30:42,43
I don't know.


783
0:30:42,43 --> 0:30:44,99
But kids are-- they love
the anti-love poems.


784
0:30:44,99 --> 0:30:48,6
Like screw you,
Dante or whatever.


785
0:30:48,6 --> 0:30:52,16
Then the other one is "Tell
Me About the Ride Home," which


786
0:30:52,16 --> 0:30:55,13
actually I kind of stole that
from a famous hero of mine,


787
0:30:55,13 --> 0:30:58,25
Seamus Heaney, RIP.


788
0:30:58,25 --> 0:31:0,55
And so, yeah, that's
some writing prompts.


789
0:31:0,55 --> 0:31:1,55
So you guys can go with.


790
0:31:1,55 --> 0:31:2,94
So I'm going to
do one more poem.


791
0:31:2,94 --> 0:31:5,15
And then you guys
are free to go back


792
0:31:5,15 --> 0:31:8,6
to your awesome Googleness.


793
0:31:8,6 --> 0:31:10,17
By the way, I have a
question about Google.


794
0:31:10,17 --> 0:31:14,596
When you are like on the
interweb, are you Google-able?


795
0:31:14,596 --> 0:31:15,97
Like I tell people
this all time,


796
0:31:15,97 --> 0:31:17,803
like, oh, they're like
where can I find you?


797
0:31:17,803 --> 0:31:19,4
And I'm like, oh,
I'm Google-able.


798
0:31:19,4 --> 0:31:20,57
That's not a good word.


799
0:31:20,57 --> 0:31:23,75
You guys have got to think of
something else to think of.


800
0:31:23,75 --> 0:31:24,25
OK.


801
0:31:24,25 --> 0:31:25,15
AUDIENCE: Google me.


802
0:31:25,15 --> 0:31:25,9
ROSE McALEESE: Oh!


803
0:31:25,9 --> 0:31:26,59
Google me.


804
0:31:26,59 --> 0:31:27,87
That's stupid.


805
0:31:27,87 --> 0:31:29,42
Why didn't I just think of that?


806
0:31:29,42 --> 0:31:33,67
Someone make a
hashtag of Google me.


807
0:31:33,67 --> 0:31:35,61
That was a dumb question.


808
0:31:35,61 --> 0:31:36,11
OK.


809
0:31:36,11 --> 0:31:38,9
This is it.


810
0:31:38,9 --> 0:31:40,34
I'm going to take
up a lot of space.


811
0:31:40,34 --> 0:31:42,14
So thank you for coming.


812
0:31:42,14 --> 0:31:44,817
This is a huge honor
and not as scary


813
0:31:44,817 --> 0:31:46,15
as I thought it was going to be.


814
0:31:46,15 --> 0:31:47,164
This has been fun.


815
0:31:47,164 --> 0:31:48,33
I hope you enjoyed yourself.


816
0:31:48,33 --> 0:31:49,48
If not, lie to me.


817
0:31:49,48 --> 0:31:50,1
OK?


818
0:31:50,1 --> 0:31:50,51
Thanks.


819
0:31:50,51 --> 0:32:0,573



820
0:32:0,573 --> 0:32:2,311
What is the first
line of this poem?


821
0:32:2,311 --> 0:32:4,6
See, this is the other
thing about poetry.


822
0:32:4,6 --> 0:32:5,93
It does not need to be
perfect and crafted,


823
0:32:5,93 --> 0:32:9,51
and sound like you went
to college to write it.


824
0:32:9,51 --> 0:32:12,23
Because I didn't go to college.


825
0:32:12,23 --> 0:32:13,57
School of Hard Knocks.


826
0:32:13,57 --> 0:32:14,355
Anyway, OK.


827
0:32:14,355 --> 0:32:15,924
I should do a football tag.


828
0:32:15,924 --> 0:32:16,59
What do they do?


829
0:32:16,59 --> 0:32:19,3
They say their name and
whatever school they went to.


830
0:32:19,3 --> 0:32:20,446
I'm going to do
that. (DEEP VOICE)


831
0:32:20,446 --> 0:32:23,74
Rose McAleese, School of
Hard Knocks, Sea Hawks.


832
0:32:23,74 --> 0:32:25,1
I shouldn't say that.


833
0:32:25,1 --> 0:32:26,3
We're in San Francisco.


834
0:32:26,3 --> 0:32:27,27
Not San Francisco.


835
0:32:27,27 --> 0:32:28,64
We're safe in this area.


836
0:32:28,64 --> 0:32:29,69
Google's safe.


837
0:32:29,69 --> 0:32:30,72
Sea Hawk fans here?


838
0:32:30,72 --> 0:32:31,515
Any?


839
0:32:31,515 --> 0:32:32,14
AUDIENCE: Whoo!


840
0:32:32,14 --> 0:32:32,42
ROSE McALEESE: Yay!


841
0:32:32,42 --> 0:32:33,87
There's like two of your guys.


842
0:32:33,87 --> 0:32:37,6
OK, so this is the last poem.


843
0:32:37,6 --> 0:32:40,85



844
0:32:40,85 --> 0:32:43,61
With a face more judgmental
than a Rorschach,


845
0:32:43,61 --> 0:32:45,43
he says, that's funny.


846
0:32:45,43 --> 0:32:47,77
You don't dance
like a white girl.


847
0:32:47,77 --> 0:32:51,36
Now before I can apply
to his ignorant comment,


848
0:32:51,36 --> 0:32:54,1
my beloved drunken friend
reassures him (TIPSY VOICE)


849
0:32:54,1 --> 0:32:56,16
well, that is because
Rose is a unicorn!


850
0:32:56,16 --> 0:32:58,79



851
0:32:58,79 --> 0:33:0,2
Sha sha sha sha!


852
0:33:0,2 --> 0:33:2,5
Where are my shoes?


853
0:33:2,5 --> 0:33:7,37
I do not spill drinks when
I dance, because, well, I


854
0:33:7,37 --> 0:33:7,96
don't drink.


855
0:33:7,96 --> 0:33:10,4
And also I need my
hands always to be free.


856
0:33:10,4 --> 0:33:13,24
I do not chase boys.


857
0:33:13,24 --> 0:33:15,98
I run in place.


858
0:33:15,98 --> 0:33:17,99
I'm a tall glass
of water that likes


859
0:33:17,99 --> 0:33:19,59
to get loose-limbed,
like liquid.


860
0:33:19,59 --> 0:33:21,6
Give me your marble!


861
0:33:21,6 --> 0:33:22,44
Give me your hard wood!


862
0:33:22,44 --> 0:33:25,255
Give me your bar top, even
roof of moving vehicle


863
0:33:25,255 --> 0:33:28,91
to truly tell you how my feet
met floor a long time ago.


864
0:33:28,91 --> 0:33:31,38
And I dare not separate
the three of them.


865
0:33:31,38 --> 0:33:34,12
I don't even need
music to dance,


866
0:33:34,12 --> 0:33:36,92
because that way I
can never be off beat.


867
0:33:36,92 --> 0:33:39,24
In middle school, I
was an awkward bag


868
0:33:39,24 --> 0:33:40,73
of bones and untalented ticks.


869
0:33:40,73 --> 0:33:43,7
Some might say a skinny
excuse, a spastic.


870
0:33:43,7 --> 0:33:46,25
My friends used to
threaten me by saying,


871
0:33:46,25 --> 0:33:50,85
Rose, if you can't dance,
we can't be friends.


872
0:33:50,85 --> 0:33:52,42
This scared me straight.


873
0:33:52,42 --> 0:33:54,25
But not straight enough I
couldn't learn how to bend.


874
0:33:54,25 --> 0:33:56,84
Since then, I have been
sweating for unreasons


875
0:33:56,84 --> 0:33:57,83
unknown to the masses.


876
0:33:57,83 --> 0:34:0,55
And it's because my body
thinks the Rapture is coming.


877
0:34:0,55 --> 0:34:3,76
And I need to produce holy
water to save me and my dance


878
0:34:3,76 --> 0:34:4,64
partner.


879
0:34:4,64 --> 0:34:8,96
People on average usually
notice three things about me.


880
0:34:8,96 --> 0:34:11,56
One, she talks a lot.


881
0:34:11,56 --> 0:34:13,76
And if she's not
talking, I'm smiling.


882
0:34:13,76 --> 0:34:15,33
And if I'm not
smiling, I'm dancing.


883
0:34:15,33 --> 0:34:17,139
And for me,
dancing's just my way


884
0:34:17,139 --> 0:34:19,19
of smiling through
a conversation.


885
0:34:19,19 --> 0:34:21,75
We don't even need
to talk to get along,


886
0:34:21,75 --> 0:34:23,87
just the heavy amount
of body language.


887
0:34:23,87 --> 0:34:26,27
And everyone is fluent in that.


888
0:34:26,27 --> 0:34:29,69
If you don't leave
me, well, hey.


889
0:34:29,69 --> 0:34:31,33
One of us is lying
and it isn't me,


890
0:34:31,33 --> 0:34:33,73
because well, I don't
take anything lying down.


891
0:34:33,73 --> 0:34:34,56
Baby!


892
0:34:34,56 --> 0:34:37,679
I can make my hips tick faster
than any maternal clock.


893
0:34:37,679 --> 0:34:39,71
I can make your head ring
like a jewelry store.


894
0:34:39,71 --> 0:34:40,429
Ay, yo, yo.


895
0:34:40,429 --> 0:34:41,27
You hungry?


896
0:34:41,27 --> 0:34:42,25
Try my salsa.


897
0:34:42,25 --> 0:34:45,5
And may cause your girlfriend
a serious heartburn.


898
0:34:45,5 --> 0:34:47,63
I am a party baby.


899
0:34:47,63 --> 0:34:50,13
I will make you cry and like it.


900
0:34:50,13 --> 0:34:53,7
I'm also a natural-born ham.


901
0:34:53,7 --> 0:34:55,449
That's why I'm cutting
this rug like a butcher.


902
0:34:55,449 --> 0:34:57,79
Now, I have
ballrooms in my belly


903
0:34:57,79 --> 0:35:0,14
and a funky ruckus
in my armpits.


904
0:35:0,14 --> 0:35:3,25
But sometimes, I'm not
good with my words.


905
0:35:3,25 --> 0:35:4,88
So I have this face
where, like, when


906
0:35:4,88 --> 0:35:6,56
I'm really embarrassed--
like I'm kind of probably


907
0:35:6,56 --> 0:35:8,49
doing it right now, my face
turns bright red, which is just


908
0:35:8,49 --> 0:35:9,82
so bad, it's really obnoxious.


909
0:35:9,82 --> 0:35:10,892
Then I have this
yoga position where


910
0:35:10,892 --> 0:35:12,142
I can put my food in my mouth.


911
0:35:12,142 --> 0:35:15,74
But my spine thinks otherwise.


912
0:35:15,74 --> 0:35:18,12
The only time my body
seems to align perfectly


913
0:35:18,12 --> 0:35:20,1
is when I'm on this very stage.


914
0:35:20,1 --> 0:35:23,69
And the only time I've ever
allow myself to feel beautiful


915
0:35:23,69 --> 0:35:25,6
is when I'm dancing.


916
0:35:25,6 --> 0:35:27,91
We make gods when we dance.


917
0:35:27,91 --> 0:35:30,12
But dancing has
never been a God.


918
0:35:30,12 --> 0:35:32,37
So there's no need
for your judgment day.


919
0:35:32,37 --> 0:35:34,98
You better rock, span,
spit, stripe your dress


920
0:35:34,98 --> 0:35:36,36
from however you please.


921
0:35:36,36 --> 0:35:40,17
Everyone was meant
to move like this.


922
0:35:40,17 --> 0:35:43,9
Now, the ignorant ink
blot of the man at the bar


923
0:35:43,9 --> 0:35:46,6
is now lost for words.


924
0:35:46,6 --> 0:35:48,93
I begin to turn away to
dance this moment off.


925
0:35:48,93 --> 0:35:52,62
He stops me and
asks if he can join.


926
0:35:52,62 --> 0:35:55,82
And I said, oh
sweetie, that's cute.


927
0:35:55,82 --> 0:35:59,2
But I think it's best
that you just back, relax,


928
0:35:59,2 --> 0:36:0,7
turn my body into a hashtag.


929
0:36:0,7 --> 0:36:3,0
Tweet about this
for your safety.


930
0:36:3,0 --> 0:36:8,39
And I'll truly show you how a
unicorn human being breaks it


931
0:36:8,39 --> 0:36:9,82
down.


932
0:36:9,82 --> 0:36:10,83
Thanks, guys.


933
0:36:10,83 --> 0:36:12,294
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]


934
0:36:12,294 --> 0:36:14,246
ROSE McALEESE: Whoo!


935
0:36:14,246 --> 0:36:16,99
We out of here, Pippo!


936
0:36:16,99 --> 0:36:18,65
Oh, we're going
to take questions.


937
0:36:18,65 --> 0:36:19,39
Oh, I didn't know it was that.


938
0:36:19,39 --> 0:36:20,69
Does anyone have a question?


939
0:36:20,69 --> 0:36:21,71
This is cool.


940
0:36:21,71 --> 0:36:25,904
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Canadian or Russian?


941
0:36:25,904 --> 0:36:27,25
ROSE McALEESE: [LAUGHS] Yeah!


942
0:36:27,25 --> 0:36:29,69
I like it.


943
0:36:29,69 --> 0:36:32,34
Someone suggested that Pippo
should be a Canadian accent.


944
0:36:32,34 --> 0:36:34,25
How do you feel about that?


945
0:36:34,25 --> 0:36:34,9
AUDIENCE: Or Russian.


946
0:36:34,9 --> 0:36:35,983
ROSE McALEESE: Or Russian.


947
0:36:35,983 --> 0:36:37,39
He could be Russian.


948
0:36:37,39 --> 0:36:38,33
I have this theory.


949
0:36:38,33 --> 0:36:40,54
I wrote a list once.


950
0:36:40,54 --> 0:36:44,7
I do social media
as a form of payment


951
0:36:44,7 --> 0:36:45,82
sometimes, which is so funny.


952
0:36:45,82 --> 0:36:47,6
I get paid to Tweet.


953
0:36:47,6 --> 0:36:49,92
And one of the lists
I came up with,


954
0:36:49,92 --> 0:36:50,8
because I was so
frustrated with the job,


955
0:36:50,8 --> 0:36:52,88
was Things Pippo is Famous For.


956
0:36:52,88 --> 0:36:54,66
He's a famous jewel thief.


957
0:36:54,66 --> 0:36:58,31
He is actually the original
member in the Beatles.


958
0:36:58,31 --> 0:37:2,9
He is also what Sherlock
Holmes was based on.


959
0:37:2,9 --> 0:37:5,31
He is Watson and Sherlock.


960
0:37:5,31 --> 0:37:6,56
Yeah, he's a pretty great guy.


961
0:37:6,56 --> 0:37:8,33
He used to have
these red overalls,


962
0:37:8,33 --> 0:37:10,214
but I lost them in
a movie theater.


963
0:37:10,214 --> 0:37:12,5
I lost them watching
the movie "Beethoven,"


964
0:37:12,5 --> 0:37:13,96
if anyone remembers
that-- the dog.


965
0:37:13,96 --> 0:37:16,536
His hands are also Velcro.


966
0:37:16,536 --> 0:37:17,93
But he's getting old.


967
0:37:17,93 --> 0:37:19,96
Oops, story.


968
0:37:19,96 --> 0:37:22,925
He's fine.


969
0:37:22,925 --> 0:37:26,75
Look, he's so regal.


970
0:37:26,75 --> 0:37:28,252
Anyway.


971
0:37:28,252 --> 0:37:30,545
Oh my god, you have a question!


972
0:37:30,545 --> 0:37:31,17
AUDIENCE: Yeah.


973
0:37:31,17 --> 0:37:32,31
I have two questions.


974
0:37:32,31 --> 0:37:33,31
ROSE McALEESE: OK.


975
0:37:33,31 --> 0:37:35,806
AUDIENCE: One is what
grades do you teach?


976
0:37:35,806 --> 0:37:37,11
ROSE McALEESE: Oh, OK.


977
0:37:37,11 --> 0:37:38,3
Mostly high school.


978
0:37:38,3 --> 0:37:39,738
I don't really do well
in middle schools,


979
0:37:39,738 --> 0:37:42,12
because I feel like I didn't
do well in middle school.


980
0:37:42,12 --> 0:37:44,73
I had a lot of fun
in high school.


981
0:37:44,73 --> 0:37:45,71
Fun fact.


982
0:37:45,71 --> 0:37:47,512
The man who introduced
me, Nathan, we


983
0:37:47,512 --> 0:37:49,47
went to middle school
and high school together.


984
0:37:49,47 --> 0:37:52,94
We were both nominated
Most School Spirited.


985
0:37:52,94 --> 0:37:54,75
So that was kind of
me in high school.


986
0:37:54,75 --> 0:37:55,97
I was just this weirdo.


987
0:37:55,97 --> 0:37:59,12
So I teach 9th
through 12th grade.


988
0:37:59,12 --> 0:38:1,39
But I really love teaching
freshman, because they just


989
0:38:1,39 --> 0:38:4,15
seem the most awkward-est.
If you can't tell,


990
0:38:4,15 --> 0:38:6,817
I'm like a jellyfish
caught in a blender.


991
0:38:6,817 --> 0:38:8,9
I don't know what to do
with myself half the time.


992
0:38:8,9 --> 0:38:10,25
AUDIENCE: I have an
interview question.


993
0:38:10,25 --> 0:38:12,125
ROSE McALEESE: You have
a interview question?


994
0:38:12,125 --> 0:38:13,46
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?


995
0:38:13,46 --> 0:38:15,321
ROSE McALEESE: Yeah.


996
0:38:15,321 --> 0:38:15,82
Wait.


997
0:38:15,82 --> 0:38:17,662
Oh my god, so OK, I did
research on you guys


998
0:38:17,662 --> 0:38:19,62
by watching this movie
called "The Internship."


999
0:38:19,62 --> 0:38:20,406
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]


1000
0:38:20,406 --> 0:38:21,281
ROSE McALEESE: Right?


1001
0:38:21,281 --> 0:38:22,37
And then the Google.


1002
0:38:22,37 --> 0:38:22,72
Here's the thing.


1003
0:38:22,72 --> 0:38:24,78
When they asked the
question about the blender,


1004
0:38:24,78 --> 0:38:26,38
the immediate thing
I thought of was


1005
0:38:26,38 --> 0:38:28,8
the blender will eventually die.


1006
0:38:28,8 --> 0:38:29,8
So you just chill out.


1007
0:38:29,8 --> 0:38:31,72
And that's exactly what
they do in the movie.


1008
0:38:31,72 --> 0:38:33,86
So where's my
internship, Google?


1009
0:38:33,86 --> 0:38:36,97
I answered the question.


1010
0:38:36,97 --> 0:38:42,17
I bet, Pippo's probably going
to get a job offer and me.


1011
0:38:42,17 --> 0:38:42,67
Whatever.


1012
0:38:42,67 --> 0:38:47,23
He's talking smack right now.


1013
0:38:47,23 --> 0:38:50,83
What other questions do they ask
you at Google for a interview?


1014
0:38:50,83 --> 0:38:52,65
Is it just that, the
only hypothetical one.


1015
0:38:52,65 --> 0:38:55,4
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?


1016
0:38:55,4 --> 0:38:57,845
ROSE McALEESE: I'm going to
talk to the HR department.


1017
0:38:57,845 --> 0:39:0,345
I'm going to come up with some
weird questions for you guys.


1018
0:39:0,345 --> 0:39:2,261
Like, what reality show
would you try out for?


1019
0:39:2,261 --> 0:39:5,5
Which Kardashian do you
think is your spirit animal?


1020
0:39:5,5 --> 0:39:6,127
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]


1021
0:39:6,127 --> 0:39:7,46
ROSE McALEESE: Things like that.


1022
0:39:7,46 --> 0:39:11,13
Which I think tell a lot about
a person, like I'm a Khloe!


1023
0:39:11,13 --> 0:39:11,81
Makes sense.


1024
0:39:11,81 --> 0:39:14,497



1025
0:39:14,497 --> 0:39:15,33
AUDIENCE: All right.


1026
0:39:15,33 --> 0:39:16,704
I'll ask my second
question then.


1027
0:39:16,704 --> 0:39:18,62
ROSE McALEESE: Yeah.


1028
0:39:18,62 --> 0:39:21,43
AUDIENCE: If I can remember it.


1029
0:39:21,43 --> 0:39:23,59
So, with your
reading disability,


1030
0:39:23,59 --> 0:39:26,35
how do you go from a
chicken scratch to a book?


1031
0:39:26,35 --> 0:39:28,25
ROSE McALEESE: So think god.


1032
0:39:28,25 --> 0:39:31,67
Oh my god, I have a great
editor who's also my roommate.


1033
0:39:31,67 --> 0:39:32,17
My mother.


1034
0:39:32,17 --> 0:39:35,25
I love Kathy Cain.


1035
0:39:35,25 --> 0:39:37,25
But yeah, no, I had a
really great editor.


1036
0:39:37,25 --> 0:39:39,42
And my publisher-- so a
funny thing about my book


1037
0:39:39,42 --> 0:39:42,52
is that I made a
paper copy of my book.


1038
0:39:42,52 --> 0:39:45,6
And I hid them in bookstores.


1039
0:39:45,6 --> 0:39:47,83
And my publisher stumbled
across it and was


1040
0:39:47,83 --> 0:39:50,36
like, wow, this is really cool.


1041
0:39:50,36 --> 0:39:51,567
I actually know this girl.


1042
0:39:51,567 --> 0:39:53,9
And this publisher was actually
a family friend of mine.


1043
0:39:53,9 --> 0:39:56,72
And she was like I didn't know
you wanted to publish a book so


1044
0:39:56,72 --> 0:39:57,75
let's publish a book.


1045
0:39:57,75 --> 0:40:2,9
So literally, it's lots of
editors and things like that.


1046
0:40:2,9 --> 0:40:5,286
And I do a lot of
exercises and stuff


1047
0:40:5,286 --> 0:40:6,91
that have helped me
with my disability.


1048
0:40:6,91 --> 0:40:7,967
It used to be way worse.


1049
0:40:7,967 --> 0:40:9,8
Like in fifth grade, I
had the reading level


1050
0:40:9,8 --> 0:40:11,33
of a kindergartner.


1051
0:40:11,33 --> 0:40:13,58
Now I have the reading
level of a fifth grader.


1052
0:40:13,58 --> 0:40:14,38
So it's great.


1053
0:40:14,38 --> 0:40:16,36
I love those "Lemony
Snicket" books.


1054
0:40:16,36 --> 0:40:18,29
Man, they really understand me.


1055
0:40:18,29 --> 0:40:21,72
Except they have really
big words in that book.


1056
0:40:21,72 --> 0:40:23,37
But yeah, now I
just have an editor.


1057
0:40:23,37 --> 0:40:25,77
And as much as I hate
writing on a computer,


1058
0:40:25,77 --> 0:40:28,24
spell check is a lot of fun.


1059
0:40:28,24 --> 0:40:31,25
But if you're dyslexic,
there's a lot of loopholes.


1060
0:40:31,25 --> 0:40:34,63
Like I can write the word "I,"
when I really mean myself.


1061
0:40:34,63 --> 0:40:36,51
I can write this eye
when I mean this I.


1062
0:40:36,51 --> 0:40:38,23
And spell check
won't correct it.


1063
0:40:38,23 --> 0:40:42,81
There needs to be a grammar
check, especially on Twitter.


1064
0:40:42,81 --> 0:40:43,84
The your and you're.


1065
0:40:43,84 --> 0:40:44,775
Oh, I hate that.


1066
0:40:44,775 --> 0:40:47,14
Or there and their.


1067
0:40:47,14 --> 0:40:48,11
Remember DOL?


1068
0:40:48,11 --> 0:40:51,76
They don't teach that
in schools anymore?


1069
0:40:51,76 --> 0:40:51,69
Is that it?


1070
0:40:51,69 --> 0:40:53,174
Am I good to-- You
have a question?


1071
0:40:53,174 --> 0:40:55,382
AUDIENCE: So you're perfectly
happy for your spelling


1072
0:40:55,382 --> 0:40:56,11
to be corrected.


1073
0:40:56,11 --> 0:40:58,885
You don't feel like
that it loses something?


1074
0:40:58,885 --> 0:41:0,26
ROSE McALEESE:
No, I don't really


1075
0:41:0,26 --> 0:41:2,52
mind when people
correct my spelling.


1076
0:41:2,52 --> 0:41:5,3
I bet my friends and my family
and friends and my boyfriend


1077
0:41:5,3 --> 0:41:8,75
can tell you I do these
idiosyncricities or something


1078
0:41:8,75 --> 0:41:9,71
like that.


1079
0:41:9,71 --> 0:41:10,92
I also have a mush mouth.


1080
0:41:10,92 --> 0:41:12,46
So I grew up with
an Irish father,


1081
0:41:12,46 --> 0:41:14,35
where I had an accent
when I was little.


1082
0:41:14,35 --> 0:41:17,21
And because of that, I feel
like I can't say certain words


1083
0:41:17,21 --> 0:41:19,5
correctly, which on top
of a reason disability,


1084
0:41:19,5 --> 0:41:22,68
just makes me like a
really great comic strip.


1085
0:41:22,68 --> 0:41:26,11
But I don't have an issue
with people correcting me


1086
0:41:26,11 --> 0:41:27,28
with spelling.


1087
0:41:27,28 --> 0:41:28,78
I kind of have more
of an issue when


1088
0:41:28,78 --> 0:41:31,6
people correct when I
pronounce things wrong.


1089
0:41:31,6 --> 0:41:33,4
Like what's that word I say?


1090
0:41:33,4 --> 0:41:34,51
PO-tin-ate.


1091
0:41:34,51 --> 0:41:35,9
Potinate.


1092
0:41:35,9 --> 0:41:36,6
But it's just potent.


1093
0:41:36,6 --> 0:41:38,6
For some reason, I want
the word to be potinate.


1094
0:41:38,6 --> 0:41:41,51
Or upstairges
instead of upstairs.


1095
0:41:41,51 --> 0:41:42,311
I can't say that.


1096
0:41:42,311 --> 0:41:44,31
Yeah, there's a lot of
weird things I say wrong.


1097
0:41:44,31 --> 0:41:46,26
Like fa-SHE-shis.


1098
0:41:46,26 --> 0:41:48,5
That's not the word.


1099
0:41:48,5 --> 0:41:51,13
I have real trouble
with speaking.


1100
0:41:51,13 --> 0:41:53,441
English is hard.


1101
0:41:53,441 --> 0:41:53,94
GAIR-age.


1102
0:41:53,94 --> 0:41:57,129
And I say that, like
a parking garage.


1103
0:41:57,129 --> 0:41:57,92
That's really hard.


1104
0:41:57,92 --> 0:42:0,26
Oh, the letter before I
in the alphabet, is HAIH.


1105
0:42:0,26 --> 0:42:2,69
It will always be haich.


1106
0:42:2,69 --> 0:42:5,365
But there are ones that
I got rid of. [INAUDIBLE]


1107
0:42:5,365 --> 0:42:6,84
feel like that one.


1108
0:42:6,84 --> 0:42:9,48
But I used to make fun
of my dad and family


1109
0:42:9,48 --> 0:42:11,76
for saying PRIHV-a-cy,
instead of PRI-va-cy.


1110
0:42:11,76 --> 0:42:14,18
But I say it sometimes,
and that one's just ugly.


1111
0:42:14,18 --> 0:42:15,792
So you can correct
me on that one.


1112
0:42:15,792 --> 0:42:18,25
But no, I have no issue with
people correcting my spelling.


1113
0:42:18,25 --> 0:42:19,15
Do it.


1114
0:42:19,15 --> 0:42:20,81
Please.


1115
0:42:20,81 --> 0:42:22,27
It's bad.


1116
0:42:22,27 --> 0:42:23,17
Anyway.


1117
0:42:23,17 --> 0:42:25,411
Like, why is there
a D in Wednesday?


1118
0:42:25,411 --> 0:42:25,91
OK, sorry.


1119
0:42:25,91 --> 0:42:26,409
I'm done.


1120
0:42:26,409 --> 0:42:27,64
We should leave.


1121
0:42:27,64 --> 0:42:28,26
Thanks, guys!


1122
0:42:28,26 --> 0:42:29,24
I hope you enjoyed.


1123
0:42:29,24 --> 0:44:29,24
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]
