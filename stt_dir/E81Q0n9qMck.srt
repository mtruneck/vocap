1
0:0:6,13 --> 0:0:10,15
Millionaire industrialist, Rupert Crandall's daughter, Emily had been


2
0:0:10,15 --> 0:0:11,199
kidnapped.


3
0:0:11,199 --> 0:0:14,789
George and I were set to drop the ransom. Time was of the essence.


4
0:0:14,789 --> 0:0:16,93
Are you sure we're in the right place?


5
0:0:16,93 --> 0:0:19,24
The botanical gardens at closing, George.


6
0:0:19,24 --> 0:0:21,859
The instructions were quite clear.


7
0:0:21,859 --> 0:0:41,92
It just seems like we're the only ones here.


8
0:0:41,92 --> 0:0:44,219
(Constable) Irwin? Sir, Sir! (Constable) Worsley?
The detective is looking for you. And FYI (For Your Information)? 


9
0:0:44,219 --> 0:0:48,11
He's not in a good mood.


10
0:0:48,11 --> 0:0:49,46
FYI? Is that a woman constable?


11
0:0:49,46 --> 0:0:56,49
No Sir--She's a sergeant! She's wearing trousers!


12
0:0:56,49 --> 0:0:58,67



13
0:0:58,67 --> 0:0:59,46



14
0:0:59,46 --> 0:1:2,69



15
0:1:2,69 --> 0:1:5,41



16
0:1:5,41 --> 0:1:8,42
Are you serious? Are you even serious?


17
0:1:8,42 --> 0:1:10,38
You need to grow a pair ...


18
0:1:10,38 --> 0:1:11,91
No, no! You need to grow a pair (of testicles) and do your job like man!   


19
0:1:11,91 --> 0:1:18,56
Is this HIM?
George?


20
0:1:18,56 --> 0:1:21,94
Only my grandmother calls me that and she's dead.


21
0:1:21,94 --> 0:1:25,25
Nice suit.


22
0:1:25,25 --> 0:1:32,32
Where do they these pencil-necked geeks?
Crandall's refusing to do-over because we screwed up the drop.


23
0:1:32,32 --> 0:1:34,5
We got to find his daughter ASAP (as soon as possible).


24
0:1:34,5 --> 0:1:39,619
Grace Crandall?


25
0:1:39,619 --> 0:1:43,2
Oh, so you don't just dress stupid.


26
0:1:43,2 --> 0:1:48,4
What's ASAP?


27
0:1:48,4 --> 0:1:49,63
How could this be?


28
0:1:49,63 --> 0:1:52,42
Where was I? In a dream?


29
0:1:52,42 --> 0:1:54,35
It felt so real.


30
0:1:54,35 --> 0:1:56,81
Even the same girl had been kidnapped.


31
0:1:56,81 --> 0:2:0,23
But I had to get back and find the real Grace Crandall.


32
0:2:0,23 --> 0:2:1,88
I just couldn't see how.


33
0:2:1,88 --> 0:2:5,76
What else can I do but go along.


34
0:2:5,76 --> 0:2:9,979
All right, car rules: no eating, no drinking, no smoking, no touching, no breathing.


35
0:2:9,979 --> 0:2:13,189
Oh! This is a lovely


36
0:2:13,189 --> 0:2:15,919
lovely modern automobile!


37
0:2:15,919 --> 0:2:19,69
I wonder how fast it goes? It smells a bit strange.


38
0:2:19,69 --> 0:2:21,589
Uh... Shall I crank the engine?


39
0:2:21,589 --> 0:2:26,879
No, you shall shut up. I got the engine.


40
0:2:26,879 --> 0:2:30,859
We're going to see my "narc". She's undercover.
"Narc"?


41
0:2:30,859 --> 0:2:34,669
Yeah, narcotics (police officer). You know, they investigate cocaine and heroin?


42
0:2:34,669 --> 0:2:37,939
Why? Those drugs are perfectly legal!


43
0:2:37,939 --> 0:2:45,449
I think you've been doing some of those drugs!


44
0:2:45,449 --> 0:2:48,969
uh...Ha, ha, ha....


45
0:2:48,969 --> 0:2:52,99
This wasn't the Toronto I knew. This was a Toronto even George could not have imagined.


46
0:2:52,99 --> 0:2:56,879
Buildings as tall as the clouds, automobiles and people crowding the streets.


47
0:2:56,879 --> 0:3:0,379
Everyone seemed so impatient, especially my new partner.


48
0:3:0,379 --> 0:3:1,92
Get out of my way!


49
0:3:1,92 --> 0:3:3,739
That's not very nice, George.


50
0:3:3,739 --> 0:3:7,19
That's Crabtree.


51
0:3:7,19 --> 0:3:24,59
Oh! Is that legal?


52
0:3:24,59 --> 0:3:25,299
Julia?


53
0:3:25,299 --> 0:3:27,699
Shut up! You're blowing my cover!


54
0:3:27,699 --> 0:3:28,999
Who's the rookie?


55
0:3:28,999 --> 0:3:32,59
He's my new partner, Detective Murdoch.


56
0:3:32,59 --> 0:3:33,509
He's cute.


57
0:3:33,509 --> 0:3:35,749
He's kind of uptight, but he's cute.


58
0:3:35,749 --> 0:3:37,409
What do you got for me Jules?


59
0:3:37,409 --> 0:3:42,819
It seems you little kidnapped heiress had a big nasty habit.
What? Blow (Cocaine)?


60
0:3:42,819 --> 0:3:50,409
Gambling. She was in deep (in debt).
Three guesses as to who played the bookie.


61
0:3:50,409 --> 0:3:53,99
I recognize this building.


62
0:3:53,99 --> 0:3:56,139
Yeah, every cop in town knows this building.


63
0:3:56,139 --> 0:4:0,709
And HE'S why.
Is that...?


64
0:4:0,709 --> 0:4:1,919
Brackenreid.


65
0:4:1,919 --> 0:4:4,589
Toronto's number one bookie. He's a nasty character.


66
0:4:4,589 --> 0:4:9,159
He's going down this time. I don't care if it costs me my badge.


67
0:4:9,159 --> 0:4:10,68
Everything was upside down!


68
0:4:10,68 --> 0:4:12,589
Inspector Brackenreid a crime lord?


69
0:4:12,589 --> 0:4:14,99
Julia undercover?


70
0:4:14,99 --> 0:4:15,339
Drugs illegal?


71
0:4:15,339 --> 0:4:17,199
Women policemen?


72
0:4:17,199 --> 0:4:18,0
Toronto, but not Tornto.


73
0:4:18,0 --> 0:4:20,18
But strangest of all, 


74
0:4:20,18 --> 0:4:21,279
the same crime


75
0:4:21,279 --> 0:4:22,909
in two different ages.


76
0:4:22,909 --> 0:4:25,199
Now I had to save the life of not one


77
0:4:25,199 --> 0:4:29,18
but two Grace Crandalls. And I had no idea how.


78
0:4:29,18 --> 0:4:31,519
Oh, George. I think you should slow down.


79
0:4:31,519 --> 0:4:47,88
I'm going to be sick!


80
0:4:47,88 --> 0:4:49,59



81
0:4:49,59 --> 0:4:53,33



82
0:4:53,33 --> 0:4:54,4
Henry?
Well, well, well.  


83
0:4:54,4 --> 0:4:55,979
Detective Crabtree.


84
0:4:55,979 --> 0:4:57,56
Can I help you?


85
0:4:57,56 --> 0:5:1,69
No.  Thanks.
George!


86
0:5:1,69 --> 0:5:6,6
Are you my grandmother? No, so don't call me George.  


87
0:5:6,6 --> 0:5:9,969
You're my partner, so get my back and keep mouth shut!
Police brutality!  --You shut up too!


88
0:5:9,969 --> 0:5:12,36
Wait, Higgins.  We must act like a gentleman that we are.


89
0:5:12,36 --> 0:5:14,16
You're coming for a ride downtown (to the police station).


90
0:5:14,16 --> 0:5:17,699
Always happy to help out the "Boys in Blue", son?


91
0:5:17,699 --> 0:5:23,34
H, be a good boy and mind the pub while I go for a ride with my good pals here.


92
0:5:23,34 --> 0:5:24,669
Oh and do me a favour?


93
0:5:24,669 --> 0:5:26,939
Give my brief a call.


94
0:5:26,939 --> 0:5:37,2
That's "lawyer" to you, son?
Are you all right, Henry?


95
0:5:37,2 --> 0:5:38,919
So we can see them


96
0:5:38,919 --> 0:5:41,41
but they can't see us?


97
0:5:41,41 --> 0:5:46,52
You've never seen interrogation before?
Well not through a half-silvered mirror.


98
0:5:46,52 --> 0:5:47,689
I don't know why it didn't occur to me.


99
0:5:47,689 --> 0:5:50,3
It's ingenious!


100
0:5:50,3 --> 0:5:52,689
You really appreciate the little things, don't you?


101
0:5:52,689 --> 0:5:53,9
This world is full of


102
0:5:53,9 --> 0:5:55,749
man's ingenuity.


103
0:5:55,749 --> 0:5:57,83
It's humbling.


104
0:5:57,83 --> 0:6:1,469
You are SO strange.


105
0:6:1,469 --> 0:6:4,2
And SO not my type!


106
0:6:4,2 --> 0:6:6,24
This Julia was so different,


107
0:6:6,24 --> 0:6:10,599
yet so much the same. I was happy to be
working with her again free from our


108
0:6:10,599 --> 0:6:15,569
former restraints, at least in this world.
Well, if it isn't the "Hogtown Hustler"!


109
0:6:15,569 --> 0:6:16,899
They're starting.


110
0:6:16,899 --> 0:6:18,86
Ah yes, of course.


111
0:6:18,86 --> 0:6:20,849
Take off your glasses, Brackenreid.


112
0:6:20,849 --> 0:6:24,93
Your future's not that bright.


113
0:6:24,93 --> 0:6:26,759
Where's the girl?


114
0:6:26,759 --> 0:6:28,229
You'll have to be more specific.


115
0:6:28,229 --> 0:6:30,22
You know I know.


116
0:6:30,22 --> 0:6:31,27
Is that a riddle?


117
0:6:31,27 --> 0:6:36,199
Grace Crandall had a gambling problem.  She owed you money. You thought that by kidnapping her, you not only collect your dough,


118
0:6:36,199 --> 0:6:39,379
but also a healthy bonus from her old man on top.


119
0:6:39,379 --> 0:6:41,209
What a fiendish plot.


120
0:6:41,209 --> 0:6:45,909
I hope you catch the devil behind it because despite what your compunctions believe otherwise,   


121
0:6:45,909 --> 0:6:49,879
I'm not in the book-making business.
Just tell me where she is!


122
0:6:49,879 --> 0:6:51,619
You've got nothing on me.


123
0:6:51,619 --> 0:6:54,21
And I've got nothing to tell you.


124
0:6:54,21 --> 0:6:56,49
What!?!


125
0:6:56,49 --> 0:6:56,99
Sorry, Sir.


126
0:6:56,99 --> 0:7:2,849
Mr. Brackenreid's lawyer is here.


127
0:7:2,849 --> 0:7:5,189
Ah, it seems that our time is up, Detective.


128
0:7:5,189 --> 0:7:10,19
An entertaining chat as always.


129
0:7:10,19 --> 0:7:19,119
Oh and, I would like to wish you the best with this missing girl.


130
0:7:19,119 --> 0:7:24,379
Hi George! -- He can't see you.
-- Right!


131
0:7:24,379 --> 0:7:29,8
What do you mean you need PROOF!


132
0:7:29,8 --> 0:7:31,9
He's quite unpleasant.


133
0:7:31,9 --> 0:7:32,749
I would have used a different word.


134
0:7:32,749 --> 0:7:37,319
The inspector is correct.  We do require
evidence but George is right about


135
0:7:37,319 --> 0:7:39,72
Brackenreid, isn't he?  Don't call him George.


136
0:7:39,72 --> 0:7:42,39
Seriously.


137
0:7:42,39 --> 0:7:44,619
You can't be principled to be a cop in the city.


138
0:7:44,619 --> 0:7:51,279
I don't think that's true.  You're so old-fashioned.  It's cute.


139
0:7:51,279 --> 0:7:57,8
Are you sure we've never met before?  You just seem so familiar.


140
0:7:57,8 --> 0:7:59,529
Julia, would you believe me if i told you


141
0:7:59,529 --> 0:8:2,729
that I'm not from here?


142
0:8:2,729 --> 0:8:4,419
Yes! I would believe you.


143
0:8:4,419 --> 0:8:8,389
What I mean to say ...


144
0:8:8,389 --> 0:8:10,449
My case!  My way!


145
0:8:10,449 --> 0:8:12,219
Screw this!


146
0:8:12,219 --> 0:8:17,19
Brackenreid is so guilty, I can smell it!  


147
0:8:17,19 --> 0:8:18,389
And I don't care what some paper-pushing, 


148
0:8:18,389 --> 0:8:21,22
political butt-kisser has to say about that.


149
0:8:21,22 --> 0:8:23,99
I'm going to get Grace Crandall.  


150
0:8:23,99 --> 0:8:25,9
You two can decide if following some lame procedure is more important


151
0:8:25,9 --> 0:8:29,49
than saving a girl's life.


152
0:8:29,49 --> 0:8:36,11
That's a very good point.


153
0:8:36,11 --> 0:8:41,729
Aren't you ... ?  -- Grace Crandall.
--I escaped.  --From whom?  


154
0:8:41,729 --> 0:8:42,74
Dr. Grace?


155
0:8:42,74 --> 0:8:43,83
Doctor?


156
0:8:43,83 --> 0:8:45,85
Murdoch, she just needs some air.


157
0:8:45,85 --> 0:8:48,59
Grace Crandall was safe but how and why?


158
0:8:48,59 --> 0:8:51,4
Was Brackenreid behind this?


159
0:8:51,4 --> 0:8:53,34
Was there more than met the eye?


160
0:8:53,34 --> 0:8:56,76
Even if i could somehow leave this time,
I wasn't quite prepared to give up


161
0:8:56,76 --> 0:8:59,46
Julia again.


162
0:8:59,46 --> 0:9:16,42
Did I belong here with her or in 1899 without her?


163
0:9:16,42 --> 0:9:18,76
A door was open.  I ran.


164
0:9:18,76 --> 0:9:19,89
Where were you?


165
0:9:19,89 --> 0:9:21,89
I don't know. It was dark.


166
0:9:21,89 --> 0:9:25,61
Well, when you ran through the door where did you come out?


167
0:9:25,61 --> 0:9:26,74
I don't know.


168
0:9:26,74 --> 0:9:30,98
I just started running and now I'm here.


169
0:9:30,98 --> 0:9:34,29
Who kidnapped you?
I don't know.


170
0:9:34,29 --> 0:9:36,6
Did you hear any voices?


171
0:9:36,6 --> 0:9:38,54
Maybe.
How many?


172
0:9:38,54 --> 0:9:40,5
I couldn't tell.


173
0:9:40,5 --> 0:9:44,82
Were they male or female? 
I really don't remember.


174
0:9:44,82 --> 0:9:47,82
What DO you remember?


175
0:9:47,82 --> 0:9:49,68
I was at home.


176
0:9:49,68 --> 0:9:51,85
I heard a noise.


177
0:9:51,85 --> 0:9:54,38
And then I smelled something sweet.


178
0:9:54,38 --> 0:9:57,36
I passed out. I woke up and saw the open door,


179
0:9:57,36 --> 0:10:1,56
and now I'm here.


180
0:10:1,56 --> 0:10:9,8
Did you run here ASAP?


181
0:10:9,8 --> 0:10:13,56
Even if she was chloroformed, she would at
least remember some landmark between


182
0:10:13,56 --> 0:10:15,14
the captor's lair and here.


183
0:10:15,14 --> 0:10:16,95
Yes, thank you Poindexter.


184
0:10:16,95 --> 0:10:18,56
He makes a valid point.


185
0:10:18,56 --> 0:10:20,85
Who is this Poindexter?


186
0:10:20,85 --> 0:10:24,44
You were raised my monks in Tibet, right?


187
0:10:24,44 --> 0:10:28,58
No, Jesuit priests in Nova-Scotia.


188
0:10:28,58 --> 0:10:30,79
That explains a lot, actually.


189
0:10:30,79 --> 0:10:33,629
Look, Brackenreid is the missing link in whatever is going on here.


190
0:10:33,629 --> 0:10:39,69
I'm going to stake him out and see if I can find some answers.
Are you two in or not?


191
0:10:39,69 --> 0:10:41,55
"Stake out" means "watch".


192
0:10:41,55 --> 0:10:43,1
Uh... yes!


193
0:10:43,1 --> 0:10:47,8
Well, perhaps we should stake out Grace Crandall as well.
She seems to have something to hide.


194
0:10:47,8 --> 0:10:51,63
Oh well, looky here!
Maybe there's a cop under that monkey suit after all.


195
0:10:51,63 --> 0:10:55,12
And don't let that go to your head.
Brains can only get you so far in this world.


196
0:10:55,12 --> 0:11:4,53
I'll tail the Crandall girl and you two, (Can you) play nice?


197
0:11:4,53 --> 0:11:18,22
I don't like your suit either.


198
0:11:18,22 --> 0:11:19,85
He has just gone back inside.


199
0:11:19,85 --> 0:11:20,95
He's still alone.


200
0:11:20,95 --> 0:11:22,21
Incredible!


201
0:11:22,21 --> 0:11:25,56
This camera uses no mirrors at all!


202
0:11:25,56 --> 0:11:29,77
And this tiny electronic wafer appears to be where all of the images are stored. 


203
0:11:29,77 --> 0:11:36,36
Oh my god, just make some more coffee, will you?


204
0:11:36,36 --> 0:11:39,6
Everyday conveniences automated!


205
0:11:39,6 --> 0:11:44,28
The implications are astounding.
Murdoch, do me a solid and shut up, will you?
I'm trying to concentrate here!


206
0:11:44,28 --> 0:11:45,87



207
0:11:45,87 --> 0:11:50,51
A "solid".  That's a favour, yes?
Yeah.


208
0:11:50,51 --> 0:11:55,38
"Full HD" Oooh!


209
0:11:55,38 --> 0:11:59,6
George, have you considered the possibility of any other suspects?


210
0:11:59,6 --> 0:12:1,76
No.


211
0:12:1,76 --> 0:12:5,64
Given that we have no evidence linking
Brackenreid to the crime perhaps it would behoove us


212
0:12:5,64 --> 0:12:12,51
No! It's not going to behoove us to do anything except what we're doing, ok?


213
0:12:12,51 --> 0:12:15,34
You appear to be losing your objectivity.


214
0:12:15,34 --> 0:12:30,7
If you don't like the way I do things, there's the door.
Or better yet, there's the second-storey window.


215
0:12:30,7 --> 0:12:31,59
What is that?  It says "Joolz".


216
0:12:31,59 --> 0:12:34,53
Yeah, well, answer it.


217
0:12:34,53 --> 0:12:37,25
Hello?


218
0:12:37,25 --> 0:12:39,78
Hello?


219
0:12:39,78 --> 0:12:43,34
Jules, what's up?


220
0:12:43,34 --> 0:12:45,81
I lost Grace.  --What?
--She was right here and then she disappeared.


221
0:12:45,81 --> 0:12:50,85
Was she captured?
No! Oh, dammit!


222
0:12:50,85 --> 0:12:51,88
I didn't lose her.  


223
0:12:51,88 --> 0:12:53,36
She meant to ditch me.


224
0:12:53,36 --> 0:12:57,17
If Grace Crandall led Julia to a specific location, 


225
0:12:57,17 --> 0:12:58,95
That means they're on to her.


226
0:12:58,95 --> 0:13:12,93
Julia, you got to get out of there NOW!
--Higgins.  --Julia??


227
0:13:12,93 --> 0:13:14,85
Something was very wrong.


228
0:13:14,85 --> 0:13:17,3
Where was Miss Crandall?


229
0:13:17,3 --> 0:13:20,25
Was Brackenreid behind this?


230
0:13:20,25 --> 0:13:25,78
What had become of Julia?  Was she in danger?


231
0:13:25,78 --> 0:13:28,96
And if she was in danger here,


232
0:13:28,96 --> 0:13:48,45
what was happening to her in 1899?


233
0:13:48,45 --> 0:13:50,18
"Please hang up and try your call again."


234
0:13:50,18 --> 0:13:53,46
We have to inform the inspector.  --There's no time.
We need reinforcements from the station house.


235
0:13:53,46 --> 0:13:56,82
No, we don't. And besides, we know it was Brackenreid who snatched her.


236
0:13:56,82 --> 0:13:58,16
How do we know that?


237
0:13:58,16 --> 0:14:0,25
I just know.


238
0:14:0,25 --> 0:14:2,66
George, we were watching him at the time that Julia was snatched.


239
0:14:2,66 --> 0:14:6,9
Well then, it was one of his cronies.
That's a rash assumption.


240
0:14:6,9 --> 0:14:9,9
And it was your rash actions that got her trouble in the first place.


241
0:14:9,9 --> 0:14:14,84
Hitting me isn't going to save her.
No, but it might make me feel better.


242
0:14:14,84 --> 0:14:21,86
Brackenreid's on the move!


243
0:14:21,86 --> 0:14:39,99
The cocky bastard!


244
0:14:39,99 --> 0:14:41,73
LEAVE HIM TO ME!


245
0:14:41,73 --> 0:14:43,89
I take the lead.
We're of the same rank.


246
0:14:43,89 --> 0:14:45,26
I take charge!


247
0:14:45,26 --> 0:14:48,8
Your methods haven't proven to be successful yet.


248
0:14:48,8 --> 0:14:49,2
Listen, you just shut your mouth ... 


249
0:14:49,2 --> 0:14:49,839
... and watch your back.


250
0:14:49,839 --> 0:14:55,59
Yes, I know.  Hey, hey!


251
0:14:55,59 --> 0:14:57,68
Gentleman, what a surprise!


252
0:14:57,68 --> 0:14:59,89
Detective Julia Ogden has gone missing.


253
0:14:59,89 --> 0:15:2,9
We know you're behind it.


254
0:15:2,9 --> 0:15:3,62
Are you having a laugh, George?


255
0:15:3,62 --> 0:15:4,75
Is he having a giraffe?


256
0:15:4,75 --> 0:15:9,3
I assure you he's being quite serious.
Tell us where she is! 


257
0:15:9,3 --> 0:15:14,54
You're starting to give me your right arm!
Don't make me report your for harassment again.
I'll give you something to report!


258
0:15:14,54 --> 0:15:16,83
Allow me an attempt.  Tell us where she is!


259
0:15:16,83 --> 0:15:21,5
That's exactly what I said!


260
0:15:21,5 --> 0:15:24,8
Listen, you two have been watching me for ages.
You know better than anyone


261
0:15:24,8 --> 0:15:27,82
that I had nothing to do with your bird's disappearance.


262
0:15:27,82 --> 0:15:29,73
In fact, you two are my alibi!


263
0:15:29,73 --> 0:15:31,5
Well, I can see how upset you both are.


264
0:15:31,5 --> 0:15:36,27
So I'll tell you what.
I'll be sure to keep your missing detective in my prayers.


265
0:15:36,27 --> 0:15:41,85
How does that sound?


266
0:15:41,85 --> 0:15:42,59
What do we do?


267
0:15:42,59 --> 0:15:44,52
What do we do?


268
0:15:44,52 --> 0:15:45,85
Well, we have options.


269
0:15:45,85 --> 0:15:47,22
I wasn't talking to you.


270
0:15:47,22 --> 0:15:50,439
The first of which is to contact the station
and have them dispatch constables


271
0:15:50,439 --> 0:15:53,0
to comb the area.
No.


272
0:15:53,0 --> 0:15:55,62
The deeper I was pulled into this investigation, 


273
0:15:55,62 --> 0:16:0,68
the more enchanted I became with this strange, world around me.  


274
0:16:0,68 --> 0:16:1,72
Humans, vehicles, information all


275
0:16:1,72 --> 0:16:6,279
moving so fast.  How did one keep up?
And who was the George of the future?


276
0:16:6,279 --> 0:16:10,949
He was so hot-tempered and rash.
Was this what one had to come to survive


277
0:16:10,949 --> 0:16:12,29
in this modern age?


278
0:16:12,29 --> 0:16:14,83
Would we ever be able to see eye-to-eye?


279
0:16:14,83 --> 0:16:16,239
What are you doing? Get out of my way!


280
0:16:16,239 --> 0:16:20,61
Julia's safety must eclipse any issues
you might be having with your superiors.


281
0:16:20,61 --> 0:16:23,13
I'm on suspension right now. Are you happy?


282
0:16:23,13 --> 0:16:27,449
The sheer irresponsibility of continuing
to pursue an avenue of investigation


283
0:16:27,449 --> 0:16:30,819
without the support of your superior ...  


284
0:16:30,819 --> 0:16:32,0
Oh, of course, because you never break any of the rules!


285
0:16:32,0 --> 0:16:34,4
I try not to.
Oh! That's a real shocker!


286
0:16:34,4 --> 0:16:37,7
That's the least of our concerns at the
moment.
Exactly!  We should be following Brackenreid


287
0:16:37,7 --> 0:16:41,62
instead of you rapping my knuckles here.  Now, get out of my way!


288
0:16:41,62 --> 0:16:45,98
I don't believe to be the best use of our limited time.


289
0:16:45,98 --> 0:16:47,39
I don't care what you believe.  Move or be moved.


290
0:16:47,39 --> 0:16:51,11
I will agree to move if you agree to retrace Grace Crandall's steps.


291
0:16:51,11 --> 0:16:53,9
I don't do well with ultimatums.


292
0:16:53,9 --> 0:16:54,18
At the very least


293
0:16:54,18 --> 0:16:57,12
It will give us Julia's last known whereabouts.


294
0:16:57,12 --> 0:17:0,88
And then perhaps we can look for trace evidence at the location of her abduction.


295
0:17:0,88 --> 0:17:4,53
This is not time for reasoning.  I'm going this one alone.


296
0:17:4,53 --> 0:17:6,26
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.


297
0:17:6,26 --> 0:17:8,589
Well, I'm afraid you have no choice.
You know what, Murdoch? 


298
0:17:8,589 --> 0:17:11,64
I would say that I'm sorry for this, but I'm not.


299
0:17:11,64 --> 0:17:16,29
Sorry for what?
THIS.


300
0:17:16,29 --> 0:17:17,73
Murdoch!


301
0:17:17,73 --> 0:17:22,44
Murdoch, are you all right?


302
0:17:22,44 --> 0:17:24,11
Where is she?  --Who?
Julia!  Where is she?


303
0:17:24,11 --> 0:17:25,27
Doctor Ogden?


304
0:17:25,27 --> 0:17:28,669
Why are you asking about her?


305
0:17:28,669 --> 0:17:31,169
I was back in 1899.


306
0:17:31,169 --> 0:17:34,53
It seemed that George Crabtree had a painful way of making me change


307
0:17:34,53 --> 0:17:35,92
timelines


308
0:17:35,92 --> 0:17:38,29
if i was ever anywhere else at all.


309
0:17:38,29 --> 0:17:40,26
But dream or no dream, 


310
0:17:40,26 --> 0:17:42,49
this wasn't where I needed to be.


311
0:17:42,49 --> 0:17:44,18
Julia was still missing


312
0:17:44,18 --> 0:17:47,2
and the Crabtree of the future was out of control.


313
0:17:47,2 --> 0:17:50,5
Would I be able to get back to 2012


314
0:17:50,5 --> 0:18:5,59
or was I home for good?


315
0:18:5,59 --> 0:18:10,15
The ransom drop was a  fiasco, we've got no new leads,
Crandall is breathing down our necks ... 


316
0:18:10,15 --> 0:18:12,3
Grace has a gambling problem.


317
0:18:12,3 --> 0:18:13,25
Dr. Grace?


318
0:18:13,25 --> 0:18:16,669
No, no. Mr. Crandall's daughter,
Emily Grace.


319
0:18:16,669 --> 0:18:19,19
You mean Grace Crandall.
That's what I said.


320
0:18:19,19 --> 0:18:20,58
Emily Grace is our coroner.


321
0:18:20,58 --> 0:18:23,0
That's what I said.


322
0:18:23,0 --> 0:18:27,4
She has a heavy gambling problem and if
you find her bookie, you will likely find her.


323
0:18:27,4 --> 0:18:31,23
And how could you have possibly discovered this?


324
0:18:31,23 --> 0:18:32,71
It's a long story, Sir.


325
0:18:32,71 --> 0:18:35,29
It might be worth a look, Sir.


326
0:18:35,29 --> 0:18:37,76
Fine.  Crabtree, see what you can find, but quickly.  


327
0:18:37,76 --> 0:18:39,539
And you, get some rest.


328
0:18:39,539 --> 0:18:42,58
I think that knock to the nap left you a bit mixed up.


329
0:18:42,58 --> 0:18:44,77
Come on, Crabtree.


330
0:18:44,77 --> 0:18:50,84
Sir, as per your earlier enquiring,
Dr. Ogden is attending a fundraiser at the Flatiron.
The Flatiron Building!


331
0:18:50,84 --> 0:18:52,82
That's Brackenreid's pub!


332
0:18:52,82 --> 0:18:54,54
The inspector owns a pub?


333
0:18:54,54 --> 0:18:57,8
That's where he's keeping Julia!


334
0:18:57,8 --> 0:18:59,52
George, I need you to do me a solid.


335
0:18:59,52 --> 0:19:4,26
A "solid", Sir?
Yes, George. I need you to hit me.
No, Sir.  I couldn't possibly (do that).  


336
0:19:4,26 --> 0:19:5,85
George you can do it!


337
0:19:5,85 --> 0:19:7,72
Just like you did by the car!


338
0:19:7,72 --> 0:19:8,93
The car?


339
0:19:8,93 --> 0:19:10,21
What car?


340
0:19:10,21 --> 0:19:13,17
Just like you did it in the park, George. Hit me!


341
0:19:13,17 --> 0:19:20,27
All right, Sir.  But let it be known, I'm very uncomfortable with this.


342
0:19:20,27 --> 0:19:24,3
George, do it!


343
0:19:24,3 --> 0:19:30,59
Oooh!


344
0:19:30,59 --> 0:19:33,61
It worked!


345
0:19:33,61 --> 0:19:37,45
I was in 2012 once again.  I knew I had to get to the Flatiron Building


346
0:19:37,45 --> 0:19:40,6
and fast.


347
0:19:40,6 --> 0:19:46,77
But I could only hope that I arrived in time.


348
0:19:46,77 --> 0:19:47,7
George!


349
0:19:47,7 --> 0:19:51,44
Detective Crabtree!  --Right!
Keep your voice down. You're going to ruin everything.


350
0:19:51,44 --> 0:19:54,83
She's here!  Julia is here!
I know.  --You do?


351
0:19:54,83 --> 0:19:56,1
Have you seen her?


352
0:19:56,1 --> 0:19:58,42
No, but where else could she be?


353
0:19:58,42 --> 0:19:59,59
What do you know?


354
0:19:59,59 --> 0:20:2,61
Oh, uh. Not a thing.
Well then how do you know she's here?


355
0:20:2,61 --> 0:20:3,32
Oh, uh.


356
0:20:3,32 --> 0:20:5,14
It's just a feeling.


357
0:20:5,14 --> 0:20:7,99
Well, that doesn't sound like you, but it's good enough for me.


358
0:20:7,99 --> 0:20:11,77
You know what stinks about this whole thing?
What's that?    


359
0:20:11,77 --> 0:20:18,35
There's no way that we couldn't have seen her being brought in here.


360
0:20:18,35 --> 0:20:21,34
This building was built in the nineteenth century.


361
0:20:21,34 --> 0:20:22,48
If you say so.


362
0:20:22,48 --> 0:20:24,74
All buildings were heated with coal back then.


363
0:20:24,74 --> 0:20:26,46
Fascinating.


364
0:20:26,46 --> 0:20:30,96
The coal was kept in a dedicated coal room in the basement.
Where the pub is!


365
0:20:30,96 --> 0:20:31,64
That's right.


366
0:20:31,64 --> 0:20:35,49
If the room still exists, it could likely access the city's sewer system.


367
0:20:35,49 --> 0:20:39,34
So, if Brackenreid brought her in that way,
we wouldn't have seen anything.


368
0:20:39,34 --> 0:20:43,15
Which would also explain why we didn't see him leave
at the time Julia was kidnapped.


369
0:20:43,15 --> 0:20:44,7
Not bad.


370
0:20:44,7 --> 0:20:47,429
What kind of a cop knows anything about the nineteenth century?


371
0:20:47,429 --> 0:20:52,95
Oh, you could say that I have a passing interest in that time period.


372
0:20:52,95 --> 0:20:57,54
It was my constant challenge to always
appear like I belonged here in this time.


373
0:20:57,54 --> 0:20:57,89
For some reason


374
0:20:57,89 --> 0:21:1,72
the Flatiron building appeared to
be the key to solving a crime in this


375
0:21:1,72 --> 0:21:5,32
present reality and in my life of the past.


376
0:21:5,32 --> 0:21:6,92
If that life even still existed.


377
0:21:6,92 --> 0:21:8,16
Where's your weapon?


378
0:21:8,16 --> 0:21:10,71
In the armoury?
What?  You're not carrying (a gun)?


379
0:21:10,71 --> 0:21:11,86
Neither are you.


380
0:21:11,86 --> 0:21:15,81
They won't let me carry a piece since my last suspension.
What's your excuse?


381
0:21:15,81 --> 0:21:19,34
You don't require firearms where I come
from to search a building.


382
0:21:19,34 --> 0:21:22,78
What is this perfect place you come from where no one needs firearms 


383
0:21:22,78 --> 0:21:26,99
and everyone gets along in perfect harmony?
Oh, there's plenty of discord, trust me.
Discord, yeah right!


384
0:21:26,99 --> 0:21:32,1
Have you ever done any REAL police work?
A lot!


385
0:21:32,1 --> 0:21:36,54
I assume you have a plan, then?
Yeah, I do.


386
0:21:36,54 --> 0:21:37,79
We wait until the place closes, and then we break in and find Jules.


387
0:21:37,79 --> 0:21:41,2
I have a better idea.  Oh yeah?  What's that? I'm all ears!


388
0:21:41,2 --> 0:21:43,179
We kick down the door on three.


389
0:21:43,179 --> 0:21:53,2
And then what?
Well, that's it.  Yeah, I like it!
One, two, three!


390
0:21:53,2 --> 0:21:56,48
I had always been a cautious man.


391
0:21:56,48 --> 0:21:59,65
but he who hesitates is lost.


392
0:21:59,65 --> 0:22:4,35
I had hesitated before with Julia, and it cost me her love.


393
0:22:4,35 --> 0:22:5,76
and I couldn't allow it to cost Julia her life.


394
0:22:5,76 --> 0:22:8,31
No matter what the consequence to save her,


395
0:22:8,31 --> 0:22:10,64
I would have kicked down a thousand doors.


396
0:22:10,64 --> 0:22:34,23
But would I find her on the other side alive?


397
0:22:34,23 --> 0:22:37,64
Three!
Hey, hey!  You'll pay for that!


398
0:22:37,64 --> 0:22:47,14
Now, where would this secret coal room be?
This way!


399
0:22:47,14 --> 0:22:51,419
Oh, bollocks!
Let's see your hands like cop and cowboy.
Take it easy, George, my old china?


400
0:22:51,419 --> 0:22:56,23
Planning a vacation?  --Let me guess.
You two are in love.  --Screw you!
That's why you faked the kidnapping.


401
0:22:56,23 --> 0:22:59,87
So your daddy would finance the honeymoon.  


402
0:22:59,87 --> 0:23:2,32
Then you took Jules to keep her from discovering your secret.
Not the smartest play.


403
0:23:2,32 --> 0:23:5,44
That's exactly what I said!
Shut up!  All of you!  


404
0:23:5,44 --> 0:23:7,33
Put down your gun!


405
0:23:7,33 --> 0:23:13,54
Do what I say or she gets it!


406
0:23:13,54 --> 0:23:15,98
Do you feel fortuitous?


407
0:23:15,98 --> 0:23:24,18
Well, do you?  Hooligan?


408
0:23:24,18 --> 0:23:26,1
Why throw these away?


409
0:23:26,1 --> 0:23:29,13
It seems like such a waste.


410
0:23:29,13 --> 0:23:31,33
Hey, is he still in there?


411
0:23:31,33 --> 0:23:33,89
Yes they've been in there for quite some time.


412
0:23:33,89 --> 0:23:37,72
I just finished the interview with Grace Crandall.
Apparently, they were going to skip across


413
0:23:37,72 --> 0:23:38,95
the border on a train to Buffalo


414
0:23:38,95 --> 0:23:42,59
and then catch a flight to Fiji.


415
0:23:42,59 --> 0:23:44,73
What women will do for love.


416
0:23:44,73 --> 0:23:50,7
Not just women.


417
0:23:50,7 --> 0:23:52,95
So, I have these two tickets to West Side Story.


418
0:23:52,95 --> 0:23:55,36
You know, the musical?


419
0:23:55,36 --> 0:23:58,66
Two kids from opposite sides of the tracks?


420
0:23:58,66 --> 0:24:0,0
Star-crossed lovers?


421
0:24:0,0 --> 0:24:3,429
Ah... Shakespeare: Romeo and Juliet


422
0:24:3,429 --> 0:24:4,91
Yeah.


423
0:24:4,91 --> 0:24:6,429
Like a less boring version.


424
0:24:6,429 --> 0:24:7,7
Anyway so, 


425
0:24:7,7 --> 0:24:13,37
if you don't have any plans ... ?  Well?


426
0:24:13,37 --> 0:24:16,73
No more suspensions, and I got Aunt Daisy back!


427
0:24:16,73 --> 0:24:19,59
Aunt Daisy?


428
0:24:19,59 --> 0:24:21,9
Oh my!


429
0:24:21,9 --> 0:24:23,1
And Brackenreid is finally in jail.


430
0:24:23,1 --> 0:24:25,63
Congratulations, George.


431
0:24:25,63 --> 0:24:28,93
Don't call me that!  Just don't.


432
0:24:28,93 --> 0:24:35,7
Crabtree, grab your phone I want a picture with you two.


433
0:24:35,7 --> 0:24:38,86
Wait.  Your telephone has a camera inside?


434
0:24:38,86 --> 0:24:40,53



435
0:24:40,53 --> 0:24:42,13
Could it be real?


436
0:24:42,13 --> 0:24:47,2
A chance to start over with Julia all over again in this strange time?


437
0:24:47,2 --> 0:24:48,87
Yet I knew I couldn't stay.


438
0:24:48,87 --> 0:24:54,86
I had to return to find the Grace Crandall of 1899.


439
0:24:54,86 --> 0:24:59,84
It develops it as well?


440
0:24:59,84 --> 0:25:4,88
The photo wasn't THAT bad!
George.


441
0:25:4,88 --> 0:25:6,34
How many times!?!


442
0:25:6,34 --> 0:25:9,1
I need you to do me a favour.
Yeah, good luck with that!


443
0:25:9,1 --> 0:25:12,17
I need you to hit me--HARD.


444
0:25:12,17 --> 0:25:14,39
Murdoch, I don't want to hit you.


445
0:25:14,39 --> 0:25:20,28
Hit me, GEORGE!


446
0:25:20,28 --> 0:25:22,919
Murdoch!  Murdoch!


447
0:25:22,919 --> 0:25:24,15
Dr. Grace?


448
0:25:24,15 --> 0:25:28,1
No, no, no.  You don't need a doctor!  Just some ice.
Sir, you were right!


449
0:25:28,1 --> 0:25:31,2
The Crandall girl is heavily in debt
and  we haven't been able to find bookmaker yet, though.


450
0:25:31,2 --> 0:25:33,63
She's not just in debt to him, she's in love with him!


451
0:25:33,63 --> 0:25:35,64
The two of them were in on the scheme together.


452
0:25:35,64 --> 0:25:37,409
Now, how could you possibly know that?


453
0:25:37,409 --> 0:25:41,1
Sir, I believe you'll find them at  Union
Station awaiting a train to Buffalo.


454
0:25:41,1 --> 0:25:42,799
Sir, he hasn't been wrong yet.


455
0:25:42,799 --> 0:25:45,36
Come on then, Crabtree. Let's go!


456
0:25:45,36 --> 0:25:49,36
George?  Doctor Ogden?
Yes, Sir. She wants to see you.
She's very concerned about your injuries.


457
0:25:49,36 --> 0:25:52,96
She has made me feel quite guilty about it. But she suggests that I apply some cold meat to the side of your face ... 


458
0:25:52,96 --> 0:25:59,85
Crabtree!  I said let's go!


459
0:25:59,85 --> 0:26:0,8
How are you?


460
0:26:0,8 --> 0:26:2,3
I heard you sustained a few good blows 


461
0:26:2,3 --> 0:26:3,59
to the head!


462
0:26:3,59 --> 0:26:5,65
I had quite a dream while I was unconscious.


463
0:26:5,65 --> 0:26:7,47
May I ask what about?


464
0:26:7,47 --> 0:26:10,39
I was in a future Toronto.


465
0:26:10,39 --> 0:26:11,39
It was very


466
0:26:11,39 --> 0:26:13,52
large and busy!


467
0:26:13,52 --> 0:26:16,21
Tall buildings filled the sky.


468
0:26:16,21 --> 0:26:17,9
Airplanes


469
0:26:17,9 --> 0:26:21,429
soaring through the clouds. It was incredible!
It sound glorious!


470
0:26:21,429 --> 0:26:23,94
But only you could have such a dream!


471
0:26:23,94 --> 0:26:25,679
William,


472
0:26:25,679 --> 0:26:28,8
I have two tickets to Romeo and Juliet.


473
0:26:28,8 --> 0:26:30,38
Perhaps you would like to escort me?


474
0:26:30,38 --> 0:26:32,29
Oh! Star-crossed lovers!


475
0:26:32,29 --> 0:26:36,81
How could I not?


476
0:26:36,81 --> 0:26:39,59
Wisteria Borealis!


477
0:26:39,59 --> 0:26:41,169
Everything had turned out for the better.


478
0:26:41,169 --> 0:26:42,43
The case was solved.


479
0:26:42,43 --> 0:26:44,3
The Crandall girl was safe


480
0:26:44,3 --> 0:26:45,98
and even here in 1899,


481
0:26:45,98 --> 0:26:48,45
Julia and I were starting over.


482
0:26:48,45 --> 0:26:52,57
I might never know if my journey to the future was real,


483
0:26:52,57 --> 0:26:54,25
but I was happier for it.


484
0:26:54,25 --> 0:27:8,56
I could not have asked for anything more.


485
0:27:8,56 --> 0:27:20,66
In eighteen hundred and ninety-nine
Two Toronto cops are out to solve a crime
George accidentally knocked Murdoch out
And the plot gets thicker without a doubt.


486
0:27:20,66 --> 0:27:28,35
Our hero wakes up in twenty-twelve
Same crime, same crook, same city as well.
Even George is in, but call him Crabtree
Gotta solve a crime in this century.


487
0:27:28,35 --> 0:27:30,1
In the Flatiron is Brackenreid's pub
His old partner, Higgins, is Brackenreid's thug.


488
0:27:30,1 --> 0:27:47,18
Grace is held hostage, but something ain't right.
A time-travelling mystery's going down tonight.
It's the Murdoch Effect


489
0:27:47,18 --> 0:27:50,1
So now Grace is free, but she's hiding something.
Brackenreid laughs because the cops have got nothing.


490
0:27:50,1 --> 0:28:0,85
Now Murdoch's all worried because Julia is missing.
And he sets off on a brand new mission.


491
0:28:0,85 --> 0:28:3,429
Our heroes bust into Brackenreid's pub
And find out he and Grace are in love.


492
0:28:3,429 --> 0:28:7,48
She was in on the plot the whole damn time
And it was time for them to pay for this crime.


493
0:28:7,48 --> 0:28:8,59



494
0:28:8,59 --> 0:28:10,48
Julia's safe so all is right
But her man's got to go back in time tonight.


495
0:28:10,48 --> 0:28:14,11
He see's the Julia that he loved back then


496
0:28:14,11 --> 0:28:15,4



497
0:28:15,4 --> 0:30:15,4
And that's how this time-travelling mystery ends.
It's the Murdoch Effect.
