###22 ARTO: I don't care about the mileage so far.
###26 It's been fine.
###27 It's been fun riding.
###28 I mean, that's been one of the most enjoyable parts of the
###33 trip is just fucking hauling ass and just going.
###37 And you definitely feel like a free motorcycle renegade
###42 riding down the two-lane highway, going however fast
###45 the bike can handle.
###47 
###50 And just cruising around, not a care in the world.
###54 HARVEY: You know what, man?
###55 I kind of think Victoria and Mexico are kind of alike.
###61 Mexico is really laid back and there's always characters
###64 everywhere.
###65 But approachable characters.
###66 
###69 That one place we stopped at and the Sporsters ran out of
###74 gas, and there was this lady living in
###76 the middle of nowhere.
###79 And she's got a cell phone.
###81 And she's standing on the highway waiting for a ride.
###84 And then probably fucking seven miles down the road,
###89 it's the biggest city for smaller cities in Mexico.
###94 
###128 KEEGAN: Any motorcycle trip I've ever
###130 been on in the past--
###131 usually I'd go on trips in the summer and it's really hot.
###135 And we're probably not showering.
###136 And even if I'll go on a trip and it's freezing, it just
###140 became a thing with me and my friends.
###142 It's like, have to go swimming no matter what.
###146 Get in the water.
###147 It just became this thing.
###148 It was not an option, you know?
###152 ARTO: That's why we came here for, is for the golden hour.
###157 Look at the sunset.
###159 
###169 From the dusty dust bowl, this is a
###174 little different scenario.
###177 I'd stay here any day.
###179 
###191 La Paz es muy fantastico.
###193 
###196 KEEGAN: Wow.
###197 I can't believe it's only 5:30.
###203 ARTO: Woke up at 6:00.
###208 Where are we?
###209 KEEGAN: We're already down here.
###210 ARTO: Really?
###212 KEEGAN: Yeah.
###213 ARTO: We're down here.
###214 La Paz.
###216 How did we get from up here to down here in, what, six days?
###223 Five days?
###223 KEEGAN: Pretty easy.
###224 We just didn't stop and look at anything.
###226 We just rode.
###228 ARTO: We just drove 95 miles per hour.
###231 It's going to be a sad moment once we start going up.
###235 There's no more left.
###236 No more party.
###238 The football season's over.
###241 No more games.
###244 That's it.
###246 KEEGAN: Yeah.
###246 It's kind of lame.
###248 ARTO: More importantly, should we go try to
###251 find some fish tacos?
###252 KEEGAN: Yeah.
###252 ARTO: Let's go.

###359 That thing is not much else other than
###363 just straight tequila.
###364 
###371 It's got a decent kick to it.
###373 KEEGAN: Holy fuck.
###375 ARTO: That ain't fucking around here.
###380 Not fucking any spiders, that's for sure.
###383 That's what I imagined Baha to be.
###387 Hoo hoo-whoo!
###390 Reggie, hell.
###392 Let's go.
###395 For this part of the video, you might need subtitles.
###399 Because the slurring's gonna start.
###401 KEEGAN: Things are going to get finished right here?
###403 ARTO: Things are about to start slurring right now.
###405 KEEGAN: What?
###406 ARTO: I'm saying we can take a taxi cab around town and see
###409 what's happening.

###457 Rasta, mon.
###460 ARTO: Fresh G. Just--
###462 
###466 KEEGAN: Was that a good restaurant, or what?
###469 ARTO: I'm thinking Reggie needs to be released.
###473 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): What's Reggie?
###475 ARTO: Reggie is all shaft and all balls.
###477 
###482 Reggie is a human-sized boxer.
###485 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Oh.

###490 Yeah, that's right.
###492 Oh.
