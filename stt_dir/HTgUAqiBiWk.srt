CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: I`m Carl Azuz. And
this is CNN STUDENT NEWS. World Series starts


2
0:0:15,889 --> 0:0:19,939
tonight, so good luck to you, Tigers and Giants
fans. We are going to have some serious history


3
0:0:19,939 --> 0:0:23,23
coming up. But first, we are hitting the campaign
trail.


4
0:0:23,23 --> 0:0:27,789
For the top two presidential candidates, the
debates are over, the conventions are far


5
0:0:27,789 --> 0:0:33,309
behind us, the election is less than two weeks
away. So now what? What are they doing between


6
0:0:33,309 --> 0:0:39,44
right this second and election day? In a nutshell,
it`s an all-out sprint. President Barack Obama


7
0:0:39,44 --> 0:0:44,48
and Republican Presidential nominee Mitt Romney
are crisscrossing the country. They are meeting


8
0:0:44,48 --> 0:0:49,92
with potential voters, going on TV shows,
posing for pictures and campaigning in front


9
0:0:49,92 --> 0:0:54,879
of crowds. There will a lot of that, especially
in swing states, where it`s uncertain which


10
0:0:54,879 --> 0:0:59,329
candidate is likely to win. The campaigns
are buying up ad space, so you`ll see more


11
0:0:59,329 --> 0:1:4,25
commercials on more channels, and their running
mates, wives and families are doing all they


12
0:1:4,25 --> 0:1:9,56
can to get supporters to vote on November
Sixth. At this point, it`s anyone`s guess


13
0:1:9,56 --> 0:1:14,52
who will win the election. A CNN political
reporter says Americans will wake up on election


14
0:1:14,52 --> 0:1:19,47
day not knowing who their next president will
be. It makes the campaigning and the candidates


15
0:1:19,47 --> 0:1:23,48
due between now and election day even more
significant.


16
0:1:23,48 --> 0:1:28,46
Our next story takes us to Italy, some people
in the scientific world are stunned about


17
0:1:28,46 --> 0:1:31,3
a court case that just wrapped up there.


18
0:1:31,3 --> 0:1:35,32
Six scientists and a government official have
been convicted on manslaughter charges, and


19
0:1:35,32 --> 0:1:40,25
sentenced to six years in prison. This goes
back to an earthquake that hit the city of


20
0:1:40,25 --> 0:1:47,11
L in 2009. The court ruled that these scientists
didn`t do enough to warn people that there


21
0:1:47,11 --> 0:1:52,2
was an earthquake risk. The trial focused
on a meeting that happened one week before


22
0:1:52,2 --> 0:1:58,5
the quake. City residents had raised concerns
about recent seismic activity. At this meeting,


23
0:1:58,5 --> 0:2:3,39
the scientists determined it was unlikely
that a major quake would hit. Unlikely, but


24
0:2:3,39 --> 0:2:9,56
not impossible. When that major quake did
hit, more than 300 people were killed. Earthquake


25
0:2:9,56 --> 0:2:15,28
experts around the world say it`s impossible
to predict earthquakes with any kind of accuracy,


26
0:2:15,28 --> 0:2:20,3
they say this court ruling could stop scientists
from making predictions in the future. But


27
0:2:20,3 --> 0:2:24,92
another expert says, the case wasn`t about
predictions, it was about communication and


28
0:2:24,92 --> 0:2:27,85
the failure to get information out.


29
0:2:27,85 --> 0:2:32,46
Back in the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration,
the FDA says it`s looking into reports of


30
0:2:32,46 --> 0:2:39,18
a possible connection between energy drinks
and five deaths. The parents of 14-year old


31
0:2:39,18 --> 0:2:44,37
are suing Monster Beverage, which makes Monster
energy drinks. The parents say their daughter


32
0:2:44,37 --> 0:2:50,56
died from heart problems after drinking Monster
Energy on two consecutive days. Law suit says


33
0:2:50,56 --> 0:2:57,569
the drinks had 480 milligrams of caffeine,
that`s equal to about 15 cans of soda or three


34
0:2:57,569 --> 0:3:3,98
cups of coffee. And it`s nearly five times
more caffeine than medical experts say teenagers


35
0:3:3,98 --> 0:3:10,69
should have in a day. The FDA says it hasn`t
found any direct link so far between this


36
0:3:10,69 --> 0:3:15,18
teen`s death and the energy drink. Monster
Beverage says it`s saddened by the death,


37
0:3:15,18 --> 0:3:18,569
but "doesn`t believe that its beverages are
in any way responsible."

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes
out to Mr. Tolen`s American Government & Civics


40
0:3:24,84 --> 0:3:29,72
Class at Niles Community High School in Troy,
Michigan.


41
0:3:29,72 --> 0:3:36,59
What is this: You know what to do, is it a
mammal, reptile, a fish or amphibian? You`ve


42
0:3:36,59 --> 0:3:40,79
got three seconds, go!


43
0:3:40,79 --> 0:3:50,47
What you are looking at is a mammal, specifically
it`s a beluga whale, which is sometimes called,


44
0:3:50,47 --> 0:3:55,12
a white whale. That`s your answer and that`s
your "Shoutout."


45
0:3:55,12 --> 0:3:56,73
(END VIDEO CLIP)


46
0:3:56,73 --> 0:4:2,48
AZUZ: Well, here is a fun fact for you. Belugas
are sometimes called canaries of the sea,


47
0:4:2,48 --> 0:4:7,3
because they make this high-pitch chirping
sounds, scientists are saying, though, that`s


48
0:4:7,3 --> 0:4:10,73
not the only sounds that these whales can
make.


49
0:4:10,73 --> 0:4:13,91
(VIDEO CLIP)


50
0:4:13,91 --> 0:4:26,129
AZUZ: It sounded kind of like a person`s voice,
but muffled, right? That was a beluga. Researchers


51
0:4:26,129 --> 0:4:30,63
think it figured out how to mimic the human
voice after spending a lot of time around


52
0:4:30,63 --> 0:4:35,88
people. What clued researchers in was when
a diver thought someone was giving him underwater


53
0:4:35,88 --> 0:4:41,75
directions, telling him to get out of the
tank. It turns out, he was hearing the whale.


54
0:4:41,75 --> 0:4:47,15
It`s fascinating stuff. The next story today
is about pirates. Not the movies, those are


55
0:4:47,15 --> 0:4:51,53
kind of fun, we are talking about the pirates
involved in some of the very dangerous attacks


56
0:4:51,53 --> 0:4:56,52
we`ve reported on in recent years. Now, according
to new information, there are actually fewer


57
0:4:56,52 --> 0:5:1,87
of those attacks this year. The International
Maritime Bureau says piracy is at its lowest


58
0:5:1,87 --> 0:5:6,83
level since 2008. During the first nine months
of this year, the organization says there


59
0:5:6,83 --> 0:5:13,2
have been 233 actual and attempted pirate
attacks around the world. During the same


60
0:5:13,2 --> 0:5:19,43
timeframe last year, there were 352. The leader
of the group says it`s good news, but he added


61
0:5:19,43 --> 0:5:23,41
that the voters where these attacks happen
are still dangerous, and that there still


62
0:5:23,41 --> 0:5:26,419
needs to be a Naval presence there.


63
0:5:26,419 --> 0:5:31,74
On this day in history, in 1861, the first
transcontinental telegram was sent from San


64
0:5:31,74 --> 0:5:36,69
Francisco to Washington, D.C. It was the first
instant communication from one side of the


65
0:5:36,69 --> 0:5:42,729
U.S. to the other. In 1940, part of the Fair
Labor Standards Act went into effect. It set


66
0:5:42,729 --> 0:5:48,8
the standard work week for American workers
at 40 hours, and in 1992, the Toronto Blue


67
0:5:48,8 --> 0:5:53,99
Jays beat the Atlanta Braves in a six game
to win the World Series. It was the first


68
0:5:53,99 --> 0:5:58,21
time that a Canadian team won the baseball
championship.


69
0:5:58,21 --> 0:6:3,56
Something else happened on this day in history,
and it makes October 24th an annual event.


70
0:6:3,56 --> 0:6:9,6
It`s United Nations Day, because on this day
in 1945, the international organization was


71
0:6:9,6 --> 0:6:14,9
born. The idea for the U.N. came out of World
War II. Representatives from 50 countries


72
0:6:14,9 --> 0:6:19,93
got together to create a charter for the group.
It says the U.N.`s goals are to maintain international


73
0:6:19,93 --> 0:6:26,8
peace and security, develop friendly relations
among nations and work together to solve global


74
0:6:26,8 --> 0:6:32,639
problems. On October 24th, 1945, a majority
of the countries ratified that charter and


75
0:6:32,639 --> 0:6:37,639
the United Nations officially came into existence.


76
0:6:37,639 --> 0:6:43,1
This is Alexandria Horstman, she`s using that
laptop to attend school with little help from


77
0:6:43,1 --> 0:6:47,9
her friends. Here is what this about: Alexandria
is a freshman in Highland, Illinois. At the


78
0:6:47,9 --> 0:6:52,8
start of this school year, doctors told her
she`d have to miss up to three months because


79
0:6:52,8 --> 0:6:57,13
of some medical problem she was dealing with.
Her school uses laptops and iPads, so one


80
0:6:57,13 --> 0:7:3,139
of her friends came up with this idea to carry
Alexandria, using her laptop from class to


81
0:7:3,139 --> 0:7:8,12
class. So she`s not skipping school, she is
skyping school. She is getting better, faster


82
0:7:8,12 --> 0:7:13,889
than doctors predicted. In fact, Alexandria
could be back in class in person this week.


83
0:7:13,889 --> 0:7:18,71
And here is the word to the wise for you:
telekinesis, it`s the ability to make things


84
0:7:18,71 --> 0:7:23,96
move without touching them, so you are using
just your mind. It might sound like a superpower,


85
0:7:23,96 --> 0:7:28,58
and it is for some comic book characters,
but researchers are using telekinesis to help


86
0:7:28,58 --> 0:7:33,49
people who have everyday physical struggles,
like for example, people who are paralyzed.


87
0:7:33,49 --> 0:7:34,22
Take a look at this.


88
0:7:34,22 --> 0:7:34,85
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


89
0:7:34,85 --> 0:7:38,97
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If you have someone that
can`t communicate, you can completely change


90
0:7:38,97 --> 0:7:42,639
their quality of life by allowing them to
communicate. But the next thing that you want


91
0:7:42,639 --> 0:7:47,669
to restore is mobility. So, the next project
that we took upon ourselves was to try to


92
0:7:47,669 --> 0:7:52,419
be able to drive a wheelchair with mind signals.


93
0:7:52,419 --> 0:8:0,8
I`m the creator and the director of the Georgia
Tech brain lab, which is a research group


94
0:8:0,8 --> 0:8:6,699
that`s devoted to researching and understanding
what kind of control we can have from brain


95
0:8:6,699 --> 0:8:7,61
signals alone.


96
0:8:7,61 --> 0:8:14,259
We were one of the very first labs to control
a wheelchair with brain signals. And we`ve


97
0:8:14,259 --> 0:8:19,37
used a variety of different mechanisms, so
that we might have boxes flashing at different


98
0:8:19,37 --> 0:8:25,63
speeds, and we can tell by brain signal processing
that if you are watching this box that`s flashing


99
0:8:25,63 --> 0:8:30,6
at ten times a second, or this one that`s
flashing at 15 times a second, all you have


100
0:8:30,6 --> 0:8:33,669
to do is pay attention to the one you want.
If you want to turn right, you pay attention


101
0:8:33,669 --> 0:8:38,389
to the one on the right, and we can see, which
one you are looking at by the oscillations


102
0:8:38,389 --> 0:8:41,94
in the brain, how many times a second your
brain is processing it. We can say, you are


103
0:8:41,94 --> 0:8:46,7
looking at the one that`s flashing ten times
a second, and we can turn a wheelchair. Out


104
0:8:46,7 --> 0:8:51,899
most recent wheelchair, one of my master students,
Michael Boys (ph), who is a wheelchair user


105
0:8:51,899 --> 0:8:59,44
himself, reverse-engineered his own wheelchair
to be driven by this - the visual interface,


106
0:8:59,44 --> 0:9:5,7
and he actually drove it around the building
quite a bit. So, that was exciting, and it


107
0:9:5,7 --> 0:9:9,25
gives people control without having to move
a joystick, without having to press a button,


108
0:9:9,25 --> 0:9:14,8
but to be able to move around your own home
without assistance was very important. We


109
0:9:14,8 --> 0:9:18,74
are very focused on providing independence
to people with physical disabilities.


110
0:9:18,74 --> 0:9:19,839
(END VIDEOTAPE)


111
0:9:19,839 --> 0:9:24,11
AZUZ: Some football coaches might not seem
like natural pranksters, but the head coach


112
0:9:24,11 --> 0:9:28,35
at Umass had a good one. He was running a
team meeting last week that was interrupted


113
0:9:28,35 --> 0:9:33,399
by state police officers. They said they had
paperwork for two walk on players, guys might


114
0:9:33,399 --> 0:9:37,87
have thought they were in trouble, but when
they read the fine print, it turns out they


115
0:9:37,87 --> 0:9:43,62
were being awarded full athletic scholarships.
The Youtube video makes one thing clear: the


116
0:9:43,62 --> 0:9:47,89
team might not have the best record on the
field, but that coach is number one in the


117
0:9:47,89 --> 0:9:52,39
college football prankings. Oh yeah, football
puns. We can`t pass them up. We are going


118
0:9:52,39 --> 0:11:52,39
to take a hike and pass them back to your
teachers. I`m Carl Azuz.
