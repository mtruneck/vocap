1
0:0:3,88 --> 0:0:16,659
...


2
0:0:16,659 --> 0:0:18,179
...


3
0:0:18,179 --> 0:0:30,189
...


4
0:0:30,189 --> 0:0:31,81
it's truly amazing


5
0:0:31,81 --> 0:0:39,37
the number of conditions that respond
favorably cannabis


6
0:0:39,37 --> 0:0:41,7
We are looking at an


7
0:0:41,7 --> 0:0:43,6
unexcelled wonder plant


8
0:0:43,6 --> 0:0:46,7
an herbal medicine that has


9
0:0:46,7 --> 0:0:49,46
no comparison


10
0:0:49,46 --> 0:0:54,2
It would appear that cannabis and hemp 


11
0:0:54,2 --> 0:0:56,43
were one of the first plants grown in agriculture


12
0:0:56,43 --> 0:1:0,97
we came out of being hunters and gatherers
at about ten thousand years ago


13
0:1:0,97 --> 0:1:7,689
and so that's at least the length of
time a cannabis has been cultivated


14
0:1:7,689 --> 0:1:10,61
Cannabis


15
0:1:10,61 --> 0:1:12,47
has long been known


16
0:1:12,47 --> 0:1:14,95
aas a medicinal


17
0:1:14,95 --> 0:1:15,39
plant


18
0:1:15,39 --> 0:1:17,5
as a medicinal product


19
0:1:17,5 --> 0:1:20,89
the latest studies or the latest findings
are


20
0:1:20,89 --> 0:1:26,97
a tomb in china in which the contents of
the medicine bag of a medicine man


21
0:1:26,97 --> 0:1:29,64
were discovered one of the things it contained 


22
0:1:29,64 --> 0:1:31,81
was cannabis


23
0:1:31,81 --> 0:1:34,14
The tomb was carbon dated as 


24
0:1:34,14 --> 0:1:36,19
almost 5000 years old


25
0:1:36,19 --> 0:1:38,2
the conventional wisdom


26
0:1:38,2 --> 0:1:41,7
which goes to the oral history of
china


27
0:1:41,7 --> 0:1:47,15
is that the emperor Shennong wrote
first chinese materia medica


28
0:1:47,15 --> 0:1:49,46
and that it contained


29
0:1:49,46 --> 0:1:50,71
cannabis


30
0:1:50,71 --> 0:1:55,9
He is alleged to have written it in 2637 bc which would be


31
0:1:55,9 --> 0:1:58,9
almost 5000 years ago


32
0:1:58,9 --> 0:2:3,84
the oldest known copy of that goes back to
some ranging about 100 bc and 100 ad


33
0:2:3,84 --> 0:2:5,21
100 bc and 100 ad


34
0:2:5,21 --> 0:2:7,89
the oldest actual written record of the


35
0:2:7,89 --> 0:2:9,57
use of cannabis as a medicine 


36
0:2:9,57 --> 0:2:10,58
is found


37
0:2:10,58 --> 0:2:15,369
in the writings of the Indian as in been
India ayurvedic medicine


38
0:2:15,369 --> 0:2:16,82
In which that


39
0:2:16,82 --> 0:2:21,34
a piece of  history is dated eight
somewhere between 1100 bc


40
0:2:21,34 --> 0:2:28,73
and 1700 bc


41
0:2:28,73 --> 0:2:33,869
Cannabis is found in every major materia
medica that has ever been written


42
0:2:33,869 --> 0:2:40,989
that includes the Ebers Medical Papyrus from Egypt


43
0:2:40,989 --> 0:2:47,9
It includes the writing of Dioscorides who
was Niro's Doctor


44
0:2:47,9 --> 0:2:48,649
and


45
0:2:48,649 --> 0:2:52,969
his materia medica was used for over a
 1000 years


46
0:2:52,969 --> 0:2:56,67
and it was included in the united states
for pharacopeia


47
0:2:56,67 --> 0:2:57,739
from


48
0:2:57,739 --> 0:3:1,599
1854 until 1941


49
0:3:1,599 --> 0:3:2,54
Marijuana 


50
0:3:2,54 --> 0:3:6,43
has been a medicine for a lot longer
than it hasn't been a medicine


51
0:3:6,43 --> 0:3:8,859
evidence suggests that it was used


52
0:3:8,859 --> 0:3:11,189
in northern china


53
0:3:11,189 --> 0:3:12,399
for either


54
0:3:12,399 --> 0:3:17,259
shamanists purposes or religion or
healing


55
0:3:17,259 --> 0:3:20,949
The culture of cannabis as medicine


56
0:3:20,949 --> 0:3:23,219
moved across the world


57
0:3:23,219 --> 0:3:28,49
india was very big in the use of marijuana
It was from India where


58
0:3:28,49 --> 0:3:30,29
W.B. Oshaughnessy who


59
0:3:30,29 --> 0:3:33,369
work for the British East India Company


60
0:3:33,369 --> 0:3:37,149
picked up cannabis and brought it to the united
kingdom where apparently it was queen


61
0:3:37,149 --> 0:3:41,79
victoria's favorite uh... treatment for
her menstrual cramps. Ultimately it came


62
0:3:41,79 --> 0:3:45,889
to the U.S.A in the early part of the
twentieth-century and most of the major drug


63
0:3:45,889 --> 0:3:49,54
companies in this country were actually
producing


64
0:3:49,54 --> 0:3:52,259
cannabis medicine


65
0:3:52,259 --> 0:3:55,549
Up until the beginning of the twentieth
century


66
0:3:55,549 --> 0:3:59,29
cannabis was probably the second or
third most commonly used medicine


67
0:3:59,29 --> 0:4:0,599
in the world.


68
0:4:0,599 --> 0:4:5,609
Cannabis was found in patent medicines
that were


69
0:4:5,609 --> 0:4:9,65
manufactured by such familiar names is
Eli Lilly


70
0:4:9,65 --> 0:4:10,739
Squibb


71
0:4:10,739 --> 0:4:12,989
Merk, Park Davis


72
0:4:12,989 --> 0:4:15,919
Smith Brothers you know the Smith Brothers 
cough drops


73
0:4:15,919 --> 0:4:21,819
It was available 
powdered, chopped and whole 


74
0:4:21,819 --> 0:4:24,369
as tincture.
It was only in


75
0:4:24,369 --> 0:4:28,7
1937 when congress
enacted the


76
0:4:28,7 --> 0:4:30,759
marijuana tax act. That imposed


77
0:4:30,759 --> 0:4:37,18
levy of the dollar an ounce for the
use of medical marijuana that
0:04:36.169,0:04:37.180
was the beginning


78
0:4:37,18 --> 0:4:41,19
of the end for marijuana as a medicine
in the united states. it was in 1942


79
0:4:41,19 --> 0:4:42,69
1942


80
0:4:42,69 --> 0:4:46,39
when it was totally removed from the US Pharmacopeia or at least the formulary


81
0:4:46,39 --> 0:4:51,249
but up until 1942
physicians could still write prescriptions for


82
0:4:51,249 --> 0:4:52,62
cannabis so


83
0:4:52,62 --> 0:4:57,169
marijuana has not been a
medicine for sixty eight years in this


84
0:4:57,169 --> 0:5:2,949
country, but it has been a medicine in
the world for 3000 years


85
0:5:2,949 --> 0:5:3,77
it was the


86
0:5:3,77 --> 0:5:6,989
miss


87
0:5:6,989 --> 0:5:11,39
conception that use of marijuana lead
to


88
0:5:11,39 --> 0:5:14,52
debotury and physical violence


89
0:5:14,52 --> 0:5:16,3
and for that reason


90
0:5:16,3 --> 0:5:20,259
I guess the investigator would probably be
more conservative than an they


91
0:5:20,259 --> 0:5:22,809
are now and that's hard to believe


92
0:5:22,809 --> 0:5:24,81
So was considered 


93
0:5:24,81 --> 0:5:27,69
the way alcohol was


94
0:5:27,69 --> 0:5:29,669
considered in prohibition.


95
0:5:29,669 --> 0:5:35,44
So it was prohibited, all uses of marijuana.  It
had been used medicinally


96
0:5:35,44 --> 0:5:38,13
as well as for recreation


97
0:5:38,13 --> 0:5:38,779
as well as for recreation


98
0:5:38,779 --> 0:5:41,47
All uses were 


99
0:5:41,47 --> 0:5:46,4
declared illegal and marijuana was
given the status of a schedule #1


100
0:5:46,4 --> 0:5:47,66
substances. Which means a


101
0:5:47,66 --> 0:5:51,869
Substance that is without any recognized demonsterable
Theraputic effect.


102
0:5:51,869 --> 0:5:54,69
As opposed to Cocaine


103
0:5:54,69 --> 0:5:55,78
which was also


104
0:5:55,78 --> 0:5:57,409
and


105
0:5:57,409 --> 0:6:1,299
declared legal for
recreational use but still having


106
0:6:1,299 --> 0:6:4,109
Medicinal properties.


107
0:6:4,109 --> 0:6:5,18
Which is used as a local anesthetic


108
0:6:5,18 --> 0:6:28,729
For which it is still used today.
That's Schedule #2


109
0:6:28,729 --> 0:6:32,869
When the marijuana tax act was passed in
1937


110
0:6:32,869 --> 0:6:37,199
immediately Fiorello LaGuardia who was the mayor of new york established


111
0:6:37,199 --> 0:6:43,8
an august body of scientists to
investigate whether the claims that


112
0:6:43,8 --> 0:6:47,31
marijuana use was going to increase
mental illness and crime


113
0:6:47,31 --> 0:6:50,11
in the united states were valid


114
0:6:50,11 --> 0:6:53,709
and the LaGuardia commission report was


115
0:6:53,709 --> 0:6:57,3
issued in 1942 and they
concluded


116
0:6:57,3 --> 0:6:59,99
that marijuana was a a good medicine


117
0:6:59,99 --> 0:7:4,699
and that the claims that it's use would
increase crime and mental illness was


118
0:7:4,699 --> 0:7:7,699
unsubstantiated. 
Prohibition 


119
0:7:7,699 --> 0:7:9,279
can not be enforced


120
0:7:9,279 --> 0:7:12,3
for the simple reason


121
0:7:12,3 --> 0:7:17,779
the majority of American people do not want it enforced 
and are resisting it's enforcement.


122
0:7:17,779 --> 0:7:21,789
That being so


123
0:7:21,789 --> 0:7:24,249
the orderly thing to do


124
0:7:24,249 --> 0:7:27,799
under our form of government


125
0:7:27,799 --> 0:7:29,55
is to abolish a law


126
0:7:29,55 --> 0:7:32,249
chich cannot be in enforced


127
0:7:32,249 --> 0:7:37,469
a law which the people of the country do not want enforced.


128
0:7:37,469 --> 0:7:39,55
So that sentement was


129
0:7:39,55 --> 0:7:43,419
repeated in 1962 when
the Nixon marijuana commission


130
0:7:43,419 --> 0:7:44,989
of wrote their report.


131
0:7:44,989 --> 0:7:48,729
This was in the face of the
admonition by president nixon that they


132
0:7:48,729 --> 0:7:50,27
not


133
0:7:50,27 --> 0:7:50,67
recommend


134
0:7:50,67 --> 0:7:51,919
the legalization


135
0:7:51,919 --> 0:7:55,199
of cannabis for recreational use.


136
0:7:55,199 --> 0:7:56,21
sufficient


137
0:7:56,21 --> 0:8:2,389
There is a Commission that is to make recommendations to me
about this subject.... 
The recommendation of the


138
0:8:2,389 --> 0:8:5,759
commission in its first report is that
we do not feel


139
0:8:5,759 --> 0:8:10,199
that private use or  private possession
in one's own home


140
0:8:10,199 --> 0:8:13,889
should have the stigma of
criminalization.


141
0:8:13,889 --> 0:8:19,5
People who experiment should not be
criminalized for that particular


142
0:8:19,5 --> 0:8:20,109
behavior.


143
0:8:20,109 --> 0:8:24,69
Every ten years or so our government
has sponsored


144
0:8:24,69 --> 0:8:28,539
another look into marijuana as medicine.


145
0:8:28,539 --> 0:8:31,559
The last one actually now being 1999


146
0:8:31,559 --> 0:8:34,98
when the Institute of Medicine did it. Every ten
years


147
0:8:34,98 --> 0:8:38,82
these august bodies come up with the
same conclusion, that


148
0:8:38,82 --> 0:8:40,46
there is medicinal


149
0:8:40,46 --> 0:8:43,63
value to marijuana.


150
0:8:43,63 --> 0:8:45,57
its adverse effects and


151
0:8:45,57 --> 0:8:47,37
its addictive potential


152
0:8:47,37 --> 0:8:49,9
gateway drugness are overstated


153
0:8:49,9 --> 0:8:54,5
and for some reason every ten years
these reports go... 


154
0:8:54,5 --> 0:8:55,85
I don't know if they are 


155
0:8:55,85 --> 0:8:59,52
ignored, but they certainly don't seem to
change policy.


156
0:8:59,52 --> 0:9:2,12
In 1974


157
0:9:2,12 --> 0:9:6,67
a fellow with glaucoma named Robert Randell


158
0:9:6,67 --> 0:9:10,65
was arrested for possession of marijuana.


159
0:9:10,65 --> 0:9:14,3
He had found a using marijuana had


160
0:9:14,3 --> 0:9:14,96
diminished


161
0:9:14,96 --> 0:9:17,59
the symptoms that he was having


162
0:9:17,59 --> 0:9:18,32
and


163
0:9:18,32 --> 0:9:20,1
it was later found


164
0:9:20,1 --> 0:9:25,23
by both Johns Hopkins and the Jule
Styne eye institute of UCLA


165
0:9:25,23 --> 0:9:28,62
that this was the only thing that would
preserve his eyesight


166
0:9:28,62 --> 0:9:32,23
and the federal government then agreed
to provide


167
0:9:32,23 --> 0:9:38,1
Mr. Randell with marijuana for medical
purposes.


168
0:9:38,1 --> 0:9:41,37
He had made an agreement, or the government
thought he had made an agreement not to


169
0:9:41,37 --> 0:9:45,9
tell anybody about this. Well as soon as it
happened he told as many people as he could


170
0:9:45,9 --> 0:9:50,29
and
people begin to apply for this program


171
0:9:50,29 --> 0:9:53,44
which is called the IND (Investigational New Drug) program.


172
0:9:53,44 --> 0:9:58,2
At one time there were as many as
15  americans to were receiving


173
0:9:58,2 --> 0:10:2,17
300 hand rolled marijuana
cigarettes a month


174
0:10:2,17 --> 0:10:5,5
from the federal government


175
0:10:5,5 --> 0:10:7,74
There were another 35 people
who were approved


176
0:10:7,74 --> 0:10:9,27
for the program.


177
0:10:9,27 --> 0:10:12,43
In 1989 the


178
0:10:12,43 --> 0:10:14,94
first Bush administration 


179
0:10:14,94 --> 0:10:16,779
decided that they needed to review this


180
0:10:16,779 --> 0:10:18,69
They were concerned that


181
0:10:18,69 --> 0:10:22,58
too many people were applying for the
program and if too many people got on it


182
0:10:22,58 --> 0:10:23,12
and if too many people got on it


183
0:10:23,12 --> 0:10:25,829
the public might get the quote "wrong
idea"


184
0:10:25,829 --> 0:10:29,869
that marijuana actually had some medical
value which of course it actually does


185
0:10:29,869 --> 0:10:32,2
have some medical value.


186
0:10:32,2 --> 0:10:35,62
just prior to that time in 1988


187
0:10:35,62 --> 0:10:39,97
the chief administrative law judge of
the food and drug administration


188
0:10:39,97 --> 0:10:45,44
issued a ruling recommending that
marijuana be rescheduled from schedule #1 to


189
0:10:45,44 --> 0:10:47,49
schedule #2.


190
0:10:47,49 --> 0:10:48,45
In his ruling


191
0:10:48,45 --> 0:10:53,43
ruling he found that marijuana was one
of the safest therapeutic agents known


192
0:10:53,43 --> 0:10:54,84
to man


193
0:10:54,84 --> 0:10:58,71
and he stated that it was safer than
eating 10 potatoes.


194
0:10:58,71 --> 0:11:2,15
So I've always been very careful about
the number of potatoes I've eaten since


195
0:11:2,15 --> 0:11:5,0
then.


196
0:11:5,0 --> 0:11:8,69
Marijuana was widely used in the
19th century with the treatment of Asthma.


197
0:11:8,69 --> 0:11:13,32
and in the 1970's we found that


198
0:11:13,32 --> 0:11:14,75
marijuana


199
0:11:14,75 --> 0:11:16,75
has a Bronchodilator Effect.


200
0:11:16,75 --> 0:11:28,52
This is because the THC in marijuana.


201
0:11:28,52 --> 0:11:30,68
First of all


202
0:11:30,68 --> 0:11:32,63
let's


203
0:11:32,63 --> 0:11:35,1
compare and contrast


204
0:11:35,1 --> 0:11:35,91
marijuana


205
0:11:35,91 --> 0:11:41,3
with the other even more widely smoke
substance in our society tobacco.


206
0:11:41,3 --> 0:11:45,83
Tobacco was use more there than any
other smoke substance and marijuana is


207
0:11:45,83 --> 0:11:47,77
second only to tobacco.


208
0:11:47,77 --> 0:11:49,259
Lucy give me a cigarette will ya honey....


209
0:11:49,259 --> 0:11:51,0
...


210
0:11:51,0 --> 0:11:53,47
...


211
0:11:53,47 --> 0:11:56,42
...


212
0:11:56,42 --> 0:12:4,65
...


213
0:12:4,65 --> 0:12:7,78
...


214
0:12:7,78 --> 0:12:10,4
You see how easy it is to keep your man happy.


215
0:12:10,4 --> 0:12:13,5
Why not give your husband a carton of cigarettes.


216
0:12:13,5 --> 0:12:13,96
Smart move


217
0:12:13,96 --> 0:12:18,7
He will love them for their mild and smooth taste.


218
0:12:18,7 --> 0:12:22,8
He will love you too for thinking of him.


219
0:12:22,8 --> 0:12:28,4
...


220
0:12:28,4 --> 0:12:32,67
We know that if you analyse


221
0:12:32,67 --> 0:12:36,0
the contests of tobacco and marijuana
they are quite similar and the major difference is


222
0:12:36,0 --> 0:12:38,53
that tobacco contains nicotine


223
0:12:38,53 --> 0:12:40,67
not found in in marijuana


224
0:12:40,67 --> 0:12:46,32
and marijuana contains THC and
about 60 other THC like


225
0:12:46,32 --> 0:12:48,43
substances called Cannabinoids


226
0:12:48,43 --> 0:12:50,38
not found in tobacco


227
0:12:50,38 --> 0:12:53,92
but there are other a lot of other
particulars are shared in common


228
0:12:53,92 --> 0:12:56,63
and these include carcinogens 


229
0:12:56,63 --> 0:13:0,79
such as Benzo Pyrene the most potent of the
carcinogens and considered


230
0:13:0,79 --> 0:13:5,65
to be responsible for a large
precentage of human cancers.


231
0:13:5,65 --> 0:13:7,59
Benzopyrene is found


232
0:13:7,59 --> 0:13:12,52
in 50 percent higher concentration in
marijuana smoke than in the smoke from a


233
0:13:12,52 --> 0:13:14,57
comparable quantity of tobacco.


234
0:13:14,57 --> 0:13:21,82
This has been shown by 3 separate
groups of chemical investigators so the


235
0:13:21,82 --> 0:13:22,56
expectation is


236
0:13:22,56 --> 0:13:26,4
that if you smoke marijuana enough in and on a
regular basis


237
0:13:26,4 --> 0:13:27,85
you would


238
0:13:27,85 --> 0:13:31,4
encourage similar risks to smoking
tobacco.


239
0:13:31,4 --> 0:13:34,83
So what are the major health risk for
tobacco


240
0:13:34,83 --> 0:13:38,29
emphysema which I prefer to call COPD


241
0:13:38,29 --> 0:13:38,639
which is


242
0:13:38,639 --> 0:13:40,16
the new term.


243
0:13:40,16 --> 0:13:44,34
Which consists of cronic emphysema.
You can have significant


244
0:13:44,34 --> 0:13:49,45
imparement of lung function without emphysema
it could just be air ways disease.


245
0:13:49,45 --> 0:13:50,95



246
0:13:50,95 --> 0:13:54,33
Because we can't separate out the
2 components of COPD


247
0:13:54,33 --> 0:13:58,3
emphysema and the airways
component we lumped in together so


248
0:13:58,3 --> 0:14:1,1
that COPD


249
0:14:1,1 --> 0:14:4,19
COPD is the 4th leading cause of
death


250
0:14:4,19 --> 0:14:9,379
in the U.S. and the world and will become the 3rd leading
cause in 2020 it is a very important


251
0:14:9,379 --> 0:14:12,3
diseas. About 120000
americans die


252
0:14:12,3 --> 0:14:13,65
each year


253
0:14:13,65 --> 0:14:14,95
 from


254
0:14:14,95 --> 0:14:16,82
COPD.


255
0:14:16,82 --> 0:14:19,87
probably the best evidence


256
0:14:19,87 --> 0:14:20,23
for separating


257
0:14:20,23 --> 0:14:24,45
or best method for separating out a


258
0:14:24,45 --> 0:14:28,22
patient with COPD from someone else is to look at
the rate of decline in lung function.


259
0:14:28,22 --> 0:14:33,55
I shouldn't say the best it's the probably the most informative.


260
0:14:33,55 --> 0:14:37,11
But it's more difficult to do because you have to make
measurements every


261
0:14:37,11 --> 0:14:44,53
year for a number of years. The slope of rate of loss of lung function over time. We did that.


262
0:14:44,53 --> 0:14:49,46
We actually measured lung function every year in


263
0:14:49,46 --> 0:14:51,6
 marijuana smokers up


264
0:14:51,6 --> 0:14:52,52
up to 8 years.


265
0:14:52,52 --> 0:14:53,8
We found that


266
0:14:53,8 --> 0:14:55,41
the slope of the


267
0:14:55,41 --> 0:15:0,53
decline in lung function is almost
identical in the marijuana only smokers


268
0:15:0,53 --> 0:15:5,29
compared to non-smokers. Where it was accellerated in
tobacco smokers.


269
0:15:5,29 --> 0:15:6,399
Just one other


270
0:15:6,399 --> 0:15:9,24
piece of evidence that marijuana


271
0:15:9,24 --> 0:15:12,18
is not a risk factor for the
development of COPD.


272
0:15:12,18 --> 0:15:13,79
I'm convinced of that.


273
0:15:13,79 --> 0:15:16,9
and the other major health consequence


274
0:15:16,9 --> 0:15:19,91
pulmonary health consequences of tobacco
is lung cancer.


275
0:15:19,91 --> 0:15:23,1
Cancer is the 2nd most common cause of
death


276
0:15:23,1 --> 0:15:23,92
in


277
0:15:23,92 --> 0:15:24,54
the U.S.A.


278
0:15:24,54 --> 0:15:27,93
and lung cancer is most common form of cancer.


279
0:15:27,93 --> 0:15:32,57
The major risk factor for lung cancer is tobacco smoking.


280
0:15:32,57 --> 0:15:36,93
About 160000 Americans die each year of lung cancer.


281
0:15:36,93 --> 0:15:38,59
so the question


282
0:15:38,59 --> 0:15:42,47
that came to my mind was whether or not there was any


283
0:15:42,47 --> 0:15:43,55
evidence


284
0:15:43,55 --> 0:15:46,98
that marijuana would at least
qualitatively share


285
0:15:46,98 --> 0:15:49,4
some of these health risks


286
0:15:49,4 --> 0:15:52,16
with those of tobacco.


287
0:15:52,16 --> 0:15:54,38
That was the rationale for


288
0:15:54,38 --> 0:16:1,54
initiating our  studies back in the
1980's


289
0:16:1,54 --> 0:16:3,43
What is the evidence that


290
0:16:3,43 --> 0:16:5,28
marijuana smoking


291
0:16:5,28 --> 0:16:10,9
habbitual marijuana smoking can lead to lung
cancer(?) With respect to


292
0:16:10,9 --> 0:16:12,54
the development of lung cancer


293
0:16:12,54 --> 0:16:13,11
We found


294
0:16:13,11 --> 0:16:18,48
We found no evidence of any increase
risk


295
0:16:18,48 --> 0:16:21,19
of lung cancer


296
0:16:21,19 --> 0:16:21,92
ocurrance,


297
0:16:21,92 --> 0:16:25,57
In association with marijuana smoking
alone.


298
0:16:25,57 --> 0:16:28,83
The marijuana smokers if  anything had a reduced risk for developing lung


299
0:16:28,83 --> 0:16:33,14
cancer. Not a significant reduced risk
but a reduced risk


300
0:16:33,14 --> 0:16:33,61
less than 1 fold.


301
0:16:33,61 --> 0:16:36,28
So that means reduced.


302
0:16:36,28 --> 0:16:42,36
Whereas the tobacco smokers had markably increased risk.


303
0:16:42,36 --> 0:16:45,99
Those that smoked more than 2 packs a day


304
0:16:45,99 --> 0:16:50,31
had a 20  fold increase in risk.
That is 2000 percent.


305
0:16:50,31 --> 0:16:52,85
Those that smoked from one to two


306
0:16:52,85 --> 0:16:55,889
packs a day had an 8 fold risk.


307
0:16:55,889 --> 0:16:57,57
800 percent.


308
0:16:57,57 --> 0:16:58,509
800 percent.


309
0:16:58,509 --> 0:17:1,15
So that contrasts with


310
0:17:1,15 --> 0:17:5,89
no risk, no increased risk, if anything a slightly reduced risk for smokers of marijuana


311
0:17:5,89 --> 0:17:6,69
THC


312
0:17:6,69 --> 0:17:7,839
 actually has a


313
0:17:7,839 --> 0:17:10,41
anti-tumor effect.


314
0:17:10,41 --> 0:17:15,6
These are studies that were done both
experimental animals and


315
0:17:15,6 --> 0:17:19,75
in cell culture systems and for
different kinds of cancer.


316
0:17:19,75 --> 0:17:25,39
For lung cancer, breast cancer, thyroid cancer, prostate cancer gliomas which is brain


317
0:17:25,39 --> 0:17:26,78
cancer.


318
0:17:26,78 --> 0:17:28,12
That the


319
0:17:28,12 --> 0:17:32,67
development and growth of the tumor is suppressed


320
0:17:32,67 --> 0:17:36,46
by THC and the mastastiees are also
suppressed.


321
0:17:36,46 --> 0:17:41,18
So how could that be(?) well THC impares
protein synthesis


322
0:17:41,18 --> 0:17:45,49
and it's what we call Antimitogenic anti-proliferative


323
0:17:45,49 --> 0:17:48,1
which means those tumor cells don't 


324
0:17:48,1 --> 0:17:49,78
readily proliferate


325
0:17:49,78 --> 0:17:51,88
in the presence of THC.


326
0:17:51,88 --> 0:17:52,25
There are also


327
0:17:52,25 --> 0:17:54,24
There are also


328
0:17:54,24 --> 0:17:55,539
antiangiogenic.


329
0:17:55,539 --> 0:17:59,44
So they interfere with the growth and
development of new blood vessels are


330
0:17:59,44 --> 0:18:1,97
necessary for it to spread.


331
0:18:1,97 --> 0:18:7,18
and they also are Proapototic.
What is a Proapototic (?)  It is


332
0:18:7,18 --> 0:18:9,23
programmed cell death so


333
0:18:9,23 --> 0:18:9,86
when cells


334
0:18:9,86 --> 0:18:14,95
age there is a mechanism whereby the
cells die.


335
0:18:14,95 --> 0:18:18,87
It is a non-necrotic death and the die off of
old cells and


336
0:18:18,87 --> 0:18:20,1
we get rid of them


337
0:18:20,1 --> 0:18:22,879
before they have an opportunity to
develop mutations that would lead to


338
0:18:22,879 --> 0:18:24,21
cancer.


339
0:18:24,21 --> 0:18:30,32
So enhancing a Proapototic effect diminishes
the risk of the cells become cancerous.


340
0:18:30,32 --> 0:18:34,69
 So marijuana or THC turns out to be Proapototic


341
0:18:34,69 --> 0:18:36,15
Those


342
0:18:36,15 --> 0:18:40,249
appear to be the mechanisms that might
account for these antitumoral effects


343
0:18:40,249 --> 0:18:48,84
of THC.


344
0:18:48,84 --> 0:18:50,36
we decided to


345
0:18:50,36 --> 0:18:50,76
do our own


346
0:18:50,76 --> 0:18:52,86
case control study.


347
0:18:52,86 --> 0:18:56,669
Funding from the National Institute on Drug Abuse which is a major funding


348
0:18:56,669 --> 0:18:59,259
agencie for marijuana research.


349
0:18:59,259 --> 0:19:1,84
This is the largest study


350
0:19:1,84 --> 0:19:7,14
ever conducted on this subject. It was very well
designed.


351
0:19:7,14 --> 0:19:8,87
We used the los angeles


352
0:19:8,87 --> 0:19:10,49
tumors Registry


353
0:19:10,49 --> 0:19:13,11
to identify and rapidly ascertaine


354
0:19:13,11 --> 0:19:17,27
all the cases of lung cancer head neck cancer
cancer


355
0:19:17,27 --> 0:19:20,99
that were diagnosed in the LA county
system


356
0:19:20,99 --> 0:19:25,94
and of course by the time we got to some
of them they had already died or were too sick but we got


357
0:19:25,94 --> 0:19:26,83
to it.


358
0:19:26,83 --> 0:19:28,83
Over sixty percent of them


359
0:19:28,83 --> 0:19:31,9
who agreed to participate


360
0:19:31,9 --> 0:19:34,85
and were able to participate and we administered
this questionaire.


361
0:19:34,85 --> 0:19:36,799
Then we match them


362
0:19:36,799 --> 0:19:38,91
to controls


363
0:19:38,91 --> 0:19:43,33
same age, socioeconomic status, within the
same neighborhood using an algorythm which


364
0:19:43,33 --> 0:19:45,7
USC developed


365
0:19:45,7 --> 0:19:47,169
for this.


366
0:19:47,169 --> 0:19:50,1
So we could match comparing apples with apples.


367
0:19:50,1 --> 0:19:51,16
WE then administered


368
0:19:51,16 --> 0:19:55,17
this detailed questionnaires.r


369
0:19:55,17 --> 0:19:57,33
Also


370
0:19:57,33 --> 0:19:59,179
In molecular


371
0:19:59,179 --> 0:20:0,89
we got


372
0:20:0,89 --> 0:20:4,23
... smears so we could look at


373
0:20:4,23 --> 0:20:6,44
DNA to look at genetics


374
0:20:6,44 --> 0:20:8,419
to look at lung cancer.


375
0:20:8,419 --> 0:20:8,89
So,


376
0:20:8,89 --> 0:20:12,8
what we did was too


377
0:20:12,8 --> 0:20:13,5
recruit


378
0:20:13,5 --> 0:20:17,17
smokers. Heavy smokers of
marijuana


379
0:20:17,17 --> 0:20:22,15
at least a joint a day for a week and it
ended up that the average smoker of marijuana


380
0:20:22,15 --> 0:20:23,76
who we recruited


381
0:20:23,76 --> 0:20:27,42
smoked about 3 joints a day for about 15 years.


382
0:20:27,42 --> 0:20:29,51
and


383
0:20:29,51 --> 0:20:33,54
we also required that they smoked that much for
five years but the average they 


384
0:20:33,54 --> 0:20:37,76
smoked 15 joints for fifteen years so that's =
about 45 to 50


385
0:20:37,76 --> 0:20:40,99
Joint years. A Joint year is the average number of joints smoked


386
0:20:40,99 --> 0:20:45,2
times the number of years smoked.


387
0:20:45,2 --> 0:20:46,44
Over the


388
0:20:46,44 --> 0:20:48,49
study population


389
0:20:48,49 --> 0:20:52,99
was I think between 35 and
59


390
0:20:52,99 --> 0:20:54,51
...


391
0:20:54,51 --> 0:20:58,1
Of course we thought that they have to be


392
0:20:58,1 --> 0:21:1,21
teenagers in the early twenties at the
time of the


393
0:21:1,21 --> 0:21:5,65
marijuana epidemic which
you know was in the in the mid 1960's.


394
0:21:5,65 --> 0:21:10,69
Prior to that time very few people
used marijuana after that time it just mushroomed


395
0:21:10,69 --> 0:21:12,64
up to 1979.


396
0:21:12,64 --> 0:21:15,37
Represented the apex


397
0:21:15,37 --> 0:21:16,89
that means


398
0:21:16,89 --> 0:21:17,51
the active use in society.


399
0:21:17,51 --> 0:21:22,84
that is why we chose those age limits and so would be find (?)


400
0:21:22,84 --> 0:21:27,419
for any category of cannabis use
including heavy use


401
0:21:27,419 --> 0:21:29,74
(defined as more than 10 joint years)


402
0:21:29,74 --> 0:21:32,179
we look at 10, 20,30 years.


403
0:21:32,179 --> 0:21:34,26
For every category


404
0:21:34,26 --> 0:21:39,32
of marijuana use the ratio was less than 1 which means reduced risk.


405
0:21:39,32 --> 0:21:42,63
it was not significantly reduced but it was reduced.


406
0:21:42,63 --> 0:21:46,54
The compensatables were not that wide


407
0:21:46,54 --> 0:21:51,88
... so there was
no evidence, we control for all


408
0:21:51,88 --> 0:21:56,12
accumulated factors of such economic status
in common,


409
0:21:56,12 --> 0:21:56,879
tobacco smoke


410
0:21:56,879 --> 0:21:58,57
....


411
0:21:58,57 --> 0:22:2,68
same time we did a similar study on
tobacco smokers


412
0:22:2,68 --> 0:22:6,44
there was a huge effect from tobacco.


413
0:22:6,44 --> 0:22:8,13
...


414
0:22:8,13 --> 0:22:14,2
...


415
0:22:14,2 --> 0:22:15,45
...


416
0:22:15,45 --> 0:22:20,1
...


417
0:22:20,1 --> 0:22:23,33
...


418
0:22:23,33 --> 0:22:25,29
...


419
0:22:25,29 --> 0:22:29,18
...


420
0:22:29,18 --> 0:22:31,2
...


421
0:22:31,2 --> 0:22:38,9
...
0:22:33.380,0:22:38.900
...


422
0:22:38,9 --> 0:22:40,63
...


423
0:22:40,63 --> 0:22:44,82
...


424
0:22:44,82 --> 0:22:48,0
...


425
0:22:48,0 --> 0:22:48,74
...


426
0:22:48,74 --> 0:22:50,169
So. I am a cancer doctor


427
0:22:50,169 --> 0:22:53,769
and everyday I see patients with cancer
who have


428
0:22:53,769 --> 0:22:56,7
nausea from their chemotherapy or their
cancer


429
0:22:56,7 --> 0:22:58,4
losses appetite


430
0:22:58,4 --> 0:22:59,73
pain


431
0:22:59,73 --> 0:23:1,13
depression


432
0:23:1,13 --> 0:23:3,0
insomnia


433
0:23:3,0 --> 0:23:7,26
my experience over the past thirty years
of being an oncologist is that


434
0:23:7,26 --> 0:23:10,21
there's one medicine that I could
recommend to patients that can take care


435
0:23:10,21 --> 0:23:12,22
of all those problems.


436
0:23:12,22 --> 0:23:15,99
Instead of writing 5 different
prescription drugs all of which have


437
0:23:15,99 --> 0:23:17,58
side effects and


438
0:23:17,58 --> 0:23:18,76
addictive potential.


439
0:23:18,76 --> 0:23:22,48
I can tell my cancer patients to
try


440
0:23:22,48 --> 0:23:23,56
marijuana


441
0:23:23,56 --> 0:23:25,7
to take care of


442
0:23:25,7 --> 0:23:28,47
any combination of those symptoms.


443
0:23:28,47 --> 0:23:32,86
The first study that I really wanted to
do was in patience with the so-called


444
0:23:32,86 --> 0:23:35,86
AIDS wasting syndrome which was
something we saw


445
0:23:35,86 --> 0:23:40,6
before the availability of antiretroviral drugs and


446
0:23:40,6 --> 0:23:42,289
patients with HIV infections just


447
0:23:42,289 --> 0:23:47,29
wasted away. They lost weight they got
diarrhea and fevers.


448
0:23:47,29 --> 0:23:50,65
Dronabinol delta 9 THC became
available


449
0:23:50,65 --> 0:23:53,41
to help those patients increase their
appetite.


450
0:23:53,41 --> 0:23:54,78
When we


451
0:23:54,78 --> 0:23:57,24
prescribe those patients dronabinol in the


452
0:23:57,24 --> 0:24:1,84
early 1990's they said "you know this is
okay but I really prefer to smoke


453
0:24:1,84 --> 0:24:4,6
real cannabis because


454
0:24:4,6 --> 0:24:5,72
when you take


455
0:24:5,72 --> 0:24:8,289
cannabis by mouth either as


456
0:24:8,289 --> 0:24:10,26
delta 9 THC or eating


457
0:24:10,26 --> 0:24:12,36
in fact baked products


458
0:24:12,36 --> 0:24:13,6
the


459
0:24:13,6 --> 0:24:17,84
absorption is very slow and variable so
it takes about two and a half hours


460
0:24:17,84 --> 0:24:22,17
for peak to be reached and the peak level in 
the blood is quite low and it


461
0:24:22,17 --> 0:24:25,12
stays in the body for quite a long time
as well.


462
0:24:25,12 --> 0:24:27,59
Also when taken by mouth


463
0:24:27,59 --> 0:24:31,73
the delta 9 THC becomes
converted by liver to another


464
0:24:31,73 --> 0:24:33,63
psychoactive metabolite.


465
0:24:33,63 --> 0:24:35,92
people that take dronabinol


466
0:24:35,92 --> 0:24:38,3
or take 


467
0:24:38,3 --> 0:24:42,57
cannabis baked products often get more zonked (tired)
than people who smoke because when you


468
0:24:42,57 --> 0:24:45,48
smoke you don't get that second metabolite.


469
0:24:45,48 --> 0:24:47,8
and so when you smoke you get a


470
0:24:47,8 --> 0:24:50,65
very rapid peak in the blood of in two and
a half minutes


471
0:24:50,65 --> 0:24:53,75
as opposed to two and a half hours.


472
0:24:53,75 --> 0:24:57,95
people can really control the onset
of the activity and


473
0:24:57,95 --> 0:25:0,83
how long it lasts better if their
smoking


474
0:25:0,83 --> 0:25:3,51
rather than taking a pill or eating a baked product.


475
0:25:3,51 --> 0:25:5,87
So,


476
0:25:5,87 --> 0:25:6,91
our first


477
0:25:6,91 --> 0:25:8,18
study that we hoped to do


478
0:25:8,18 --> 0:25:11,8
in the early 1990's was to show that


479
0:25:11,8 --> 0:25:14,74
smoked cannabis was better
than dronabinol in


480
0:25:14,74 --> 0:25:18,21
increasing appetite in patients with
AIDS wasting syndrome.


481
0:25:18,21 --> 0:25:21,25
I tried twice to get


482
0:25:21,25 --> 0:25:25,34
cannabis from the government because
they're the only legal source of


483
0:25:25,34 --> 0:25:27,94
marijuana for clinical trials.


484
0:25:27,94 --> 0:25:30,19
Both times I failed


485
0:25:30,19 --> 0:25:34,68
and then went to Allen Leshner who at the
time was the head of the


486
0:25:34,68 --> 0:25:40,37
national institute on drug abuse and he explained
to me infact that the government


487
0:25:40,37 --> 0:25:44,37
NIDA the national institute on drug
abuse has a congressional mandate only to


488
0:25:44,37 --> 0:25:48,76
to study substances of abuse as
substances of abuse.


489
0:25:48,76 --> 0:25:53,72
So my requests have marijuana to study
it has the potential therputic agent could


490
0:25:53,72 --> 0:25:58,47
never be granted by the government.


491
0:25:58,47 --> 0:26:1,94
because congress says you can only study these substances as substances of abuse and 


492
0:26:1,94 --> 0:26:3,9
not as 


493
0:26:3,9 --> 0:26:5,97
treatments for disease.


494
0:26:5,97 --> 0:26:10,33
In 1996 the terrain changed 
when we got


495
0:26:10,33 --> 0:26:12,22
HIV drugs that actually work


496
0:26:12,22 --> 0:26:14,9
and we didn't see the wasting syndrome
anymore.


497
0:26:14,9 --> 0:26:20,18
but these drugs were broken down by
liver by the same pathway that


498
0:26:20,18 --> 0:26:22,5
metabolizes some


499
0:26:22,5 --> 0:26:24,42
illegal substances and there was a report


500
0:26:24,42 --> 0:26:26,88
in the literature of the patient


501
0:26:26,88 --> 0:26:30,87
dying from ecstasy overdose. 
It was one of the aids


502
0:26:30,87 --> 0:26:32,46
antiviral drugs that they took and


503
0:26:32,46 --> 0:26:34,21
ecstasy at the same time.


504
0:26:34,21 --> 0:26:38,37
So I said haha little light bulb went off 
that may be


505
0:26:38,37 --> 0:26:40,64
I should study to see if it's safe


506
0:26:40,64 --> 0:26:43,78
for patients on the aids antiretroviral
drugs


507
0:26:43,78 --> 0:26:46,18
to smoke cannabis.


508
0:26:46,18 --> 0:26:50,53
So I submitted that grant to the government
and that work within thier schema because I


509
0:26:50,53 --> 0:26:51,72
was looking


510
0:26:51,72 --> 0:26:55,32
to see if it was harmful


511
0:26:55,32 --> 0:26:58,5
With that application I finally
succeeded and got 


512
0:26:58,5 --> 0:27:1,26
a million dollars and 1400


513
0:27:1,26 --> 0:27:2,92
government (marijuana)cigarettes to study


514
0:27:2,92 --> 0:27:6,1
in patients with HIV. Now these
patients didn't have the wasting


515
0:27:6,1 --> 0:27:7,76
syndrome anymore


516
0:27:7,76 --> 0:27:10,78
but the endpoint of our study was


517
0:27:10,78 --> 0:27:14,85
is there a change in the amount of the
aids virus in the blood stream


518
0:27:14,85 --> 0:27:18,479
after 21 days of exposure to
either 3


519
0:27:18,479 --> 0:27:19,61
government cigarettes


520
0:27:19,61 --> 0:27:20,86
a day


521
0:27:20,86 --> 0:27:22,6
or three


522
0:27:22,6 --> 0:27:26,64
dronabinol capsules or 3 placibo capsules.


523
0:27:26,64 --> 0:27:31,31
We looked at the change in the HIV virus and 
it didn't change at all.


524
0:27:31,31 --> 0:27:34,23
We also look at the interaction between


525
0:27:34,23 --> 0:27:35,559
canabinoids 


526
0:27:35,559 --> 0:27:40,22
either smoke more oral and the amount of
AIDS drug


527
0:27:40,22 --> 0:27:41,12
in blood stream


528
0:27:41,12 --> 0:27:44,46
that didn't change clinically
significantly either.


529
0:27:44,46 --> 0:27:47,45
We also knew that people were concerned
that


530
0:27:47,45 --> 0:27:51,24
marijuana might have an impact on the
immune system that could be negative


531
0:27:51,24 --> 0:27:56,8
and we look at that very carefully in
these HIV patients and found


532
0:27:56,8 --> 0:27:58,83
no evidence of any negative affect 


533
0:27:58,83 --> 0:28:0,67
and perhaps some have


534
0:28:0,67 --> 0:28:2,11
a benefit


535
0:28:2,11 --> 0:28:4,11
in the immune system


536
0:28:4,11 --> 0:28:5,38
in patients


537
0:28:5,38 --> 0:28:8,6
smoking even more than taking the


538
0:28:8,6 --> 0:28:9,37
capsules.


539
0:28:9,37 --> 0:28:11,57
My opinion the whole plant


540
0:28:11,57 --> 0:28:12,63
is medicine


541
0:28:12,63 --> 0:28:14,929
that nature provided.


542
0:28:14,929 --> 0:28:18,77
It's the best medicine.


543
0:28:18,77 --> 0:28:20,5
It is truly amazing


544
0:28:20,5 --> 0:28:24,21
the number of conditions that respond
favorably to cannabis. The #1


545
0:28:24,21 --> 0:28:25,14
condition


546
0:28:25,14 --> 0:28:26,64
is pain.


547
0:28:26,64 --> 0:28:27,84
Cannabis


548
0:28:27,84 --> 0:28:31,48
is useful again relieving people's pain


549
0:28:31,48 --> 0:28:36,37
and is particularly effective in relieving
pain from connective tissue disorders.


550
0:28:36,37 --> 0:28:40,39
Arthritis, Fibromyalgia,
 systemic lupus, reflex


551
0:28:40,39 --> 0:28:43,97
sympathetic dystrophy. A whole host of
conditions that we don't really


552
0:28:43,97 --> 0:28:47,49
understand very well, people seem to get


553
0:28:47,49 --> 0:28:52,529
good relief from cannabis. People are able
to decreased the amount of opiates that


554
0:28:52,529 --> 0:28:57,63
they're taking and in some instances to
stop taking opiates entirely for pain


555
0:28:57,63 --> 0:28:58,92
control.


556
0:28:58,92 --> 0:29:1,85
The first modern research that was done


557
0:29:1,85 --> 0:29:5,8
cannabis was done in 1949


558
0:29:5,8 --> 0:29:9,6
demonstrate its usefulness in treating
epilepsy. I have a number of people


559
0:29:9,6 --> 0:29:13,4
who don't have epilepsy when they
use cannabis regularly.


560
0:29:13,4 --> 0:29:17,17
The founder of modern medicine is a Physician named 
Sir William Osler.


561
0:29:17,17 --> 0:29:20,45
Who was prominent around the turn of the


562
0:29:20,45 --> 0:29:24,1
nineteenth or twentieth century, wrote
the first textbook of internal medicine


563
0:29:24,1 --> 0:29:25,76
and in that textbook


564
0:29:25,76 --> 0:29:29,77
he said the cannabis was the most
effective medication for the treatment


565
0:29:29,77 --> 0:29:35,44
of migraine headaches and I certainly
have a number of people with migraines that get


566
0:29:35,44 --> 0:29:40,4
substantial relief or even prevention of
migraines by consumption of cannabis.


567
0:29:40,4 --> 0:29:45,37
other conditions that common respond
favorably to marijuana include depression,


568
0:29:45,37 --> 0:29:48,169
helps people with sleep, helps with
appetite.


569
0:29:48,169 --> 0:29:50,659
It is also very good training


570
0:29:50,659 --> 0:29:53,669
GI symptoms, nausea,


571
0:29:53,669 --> 0:29:55,1
diarrhea,


572
0:29:55,1 --> 0:29:57,809
it is excellent for treating Crohn's
disease.


573
0:29:57,809 --> 0:30:1,769
We did a little study of people with
crohn's disease and found that many of


574
0:30:1,769 --> 0:30:6,42
them were able to stop using steroids to
stop using other


575
0:30:6,42 --> 0:30:10,22
medications that they had taken for
their cronies that they have


576
0:30:10,22 --> 0:30:15,67
less diarrhea they had less abdomenal
pain. it was true miracle for them.


577
0:30:15,67 --> 0:30:16,7
There is a


578
0:30:16,7 --> 0:30:19,2
list here of


579
0:30:19,2 --> 0:30:20,289
conditions


580
0:30:20,289 --> 0:30:22,95
that was originally developed by


581
0:30:22,95 --> 0:30:25,44
doctor Tod Mikuriya. Who is a


582
0:30:25,44 --> 0:30:26,37
pioneer


583
0:30:26,37 --> 0:30:28,41
in terms of medical marijuana.


584
0:30:28,41 --> 0:30:31,66
He actually work for the national
institute of mental health and his job


585
0:30:31,66 --> 0:30:33,549
was to give out


586
0:30:33,549 --> 0:30:36,45
grants for doing studies on cannabis.


587
0:30:36,45 --> 0:30:38,88
he thought he was there to find out


588
0:30:38,88 --> 0:30:42,88
how cannabis was useful to treat medical
conditions.


589
0:30:42,88 --> 0:30:46,74
NIMH thought he was there to hand out
grants to see how


590
0:30:46,74 --> 0:30:50,59
dangerous it was. This was a
marriage made hell and needless to say he did


591
0:30:50,59 --> 0:30:55,309
not stay with NIMH for very long.


592
0:30:55,309 --> 0:30:58,18
Cannabis is seen as a


593
0:30:58,18 --> 0:30:59,779
protecting agent


594
0:30:59,779 --> 0:31:0,72
and we have found


595
0:31:0,72 --> 0:31:5,1
that it has provided benefits for people
with multiple sclerosis.


596
0:31:5,1 --> 0:31:8,37
it treats the pain in
their muscle spasm


597
0:31:8,37 --> 0:31:10,29
but more importantly


598
0:31:10,29 --> 0:31:12,7
people who were placed on Sativex


599
0:31:12,7 --> 0:31:14,799
the tincture of cannabis


600
0:31:14,799 --> 0:31:17,95
in early studies in great britain have
remained on it


601
0:31:17,95 --> 0:31:19,93
for years and years


602
0:31:19,93 --> 0:31:25,0
and rather than progress the
multiple sclerosis has stayed the same.


603
0:31:25,0 --> 0:31:25,92
Suggesting


604
0:31:25,92 --> 0:31:30,41
that cannabis may not only be effective in
reducing the symptoms


605
0:31:30,41 --> 0:31:33,55
but also in slowing the progression of
disease.


606
0:31:33,55 --> 0:31:35,309
it is helpful when dealing with


607
0:31:35,309 --> 0:31:37,94
anxiety of people that have alzheimer's
disease.


608
0:31:37,94 --> 0:31:39,76
It is helpful in dealing with the


609
0:31:39,76 --> 0:31:44,179
muscle spasms that are associated with
parkinson's disease.


610
0:31:44,179 --> 0:31:48,39
When it comes to psychological illnesses
cannabis is useful not only treating


611
0:31:48,39 --> 0:31:52,17
depression which are already mentioned
about also bipolar disorder which is


612
0:31:52,17 --> 0:31:53,679
depression and mania.


613
0:31:53,679 --> 0:31:57,529
It is useful in treating (ADD) attention
deficit disorder,


614
0:31:57,529 --> 0:32:0,83
post-traumatic stress disorder 
there was a study done at the Max Plank


615
0:32:0,83 --> 0:32:2,52
Institute in Germany.


616
0:32:2,52 --> 0:32:6,669
A few years back that demonstrated it
was used for 


617
0:32:6,669 --> 0:32:10,12
reducing fearful memory so that might
suggest white


618
0:32:10,12 --> 0:32:12,3
is used for 


619
0:32:12,3 --> 0:32:16,4
alleviating PTSD. This is
extremely important at this time when we


620
0:32:16,4 --> 0:32:16,929
have


621
0:32:16,929 --> 0:32:21,559
so many people who are serving multiple
tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.


622
0:32:21,559 --> 0:32:25,75
the pentagon has projected that at least
a third of these people and I think


623
0:32:25,75 --> 0:32:28,12
that is a very conservative
estimate


624
0:32:28,12 --> 0:32:32,8
will come back up with the symptoms
of PTSD.


625
0:32:32,8 --> 0:32:34,86
Matter of fact in regards to PTSD


626
0:32:34,86 --> 0:32:38,59
of both the Israeli government and the
Croatian government have given their


627
0:32:38,59 --> 0:32:45,45
troops cannabis for treatment of PTSD.


628
0:32:45,45 --> 0:32:48,2
The list just goes on and on.


629
0:32:48,2 --> 0:32:52,67
Many many conditions cause pain
serious conditions


630
0:32:52,67 --> 0:32:57,77
... spondylitis which can actually turn you over or make you bend over


631
0:32:57,77 --> 0:33:0,76
in a crippled position.


632
0:33:0,76 --> 0:33:2,64
People who have failed


633
0:33:2,64 --> 0:33:4,51
back surgery.


634
0:33:4,51 --> 0:33:6,11
People who have


635
0:33:6,11 --> 0:33:8,97
herniated disks,


636
0:33:8,97 --> 0:33:12,49
who have chronic dislocated shoulders.


637
0:33:12,49 --> 0:33:15,19
All of these people


638
0:33:15,19 --> 0:33:17,5
get relief from cannabis


639
0:33:17,5 --> 0:33:19,909
and they find that the cannabis provides
that relief


640
0:33:19,909 --> 0:33:22,25
with fewer side effects


641
0:33:22,25 --> 0:33:24,52
than the opiates do.


642
0:33:24,52 --> 0:33:29,24
Another thing that is sort of counter intuitive
 


643
0:33:29,24 --> 0:33:31,5
is in the treatment of asthma.


644
0:33:31,5 --> 0:33:36,11
You may have seen the ads for Advair
states both the bronco dialator and


645
0:33:36,11 --> 0:33:37,45
anti-inflammatory.


646
0:33:37,45 --> 0:33:39,26
Well so too is cannabis.


647
0:33:39,26 --> 0:33:43,17
This is why ther were numerous


648
0:33:43,17 --> 0:33:45,14
marijuana cigarettes on the market


649
0:33:45,14 --> 0:33:49,559
in the 1920's for the
treatment of asthma specifically for at


650
0:33:49,559 --> 0:33:52,34
the treatment of asthma.


651
0:33:52,34 --> 0:33:54,58
So as I


652
0:33:54,58 --> 0:33:56,75
pointed out by holding up this list the


653
0:33:56,75 --> 0:34:0,59
a list of conditions for which cannabis


654
0:34:0,59 --> 0:34:6,28
is useful is extremely lengthly.


655
0:34:6,28 --> 0:34:11,19
That's a quick overview of some of the
conditions that cannabis 


656
0:34:11,19 --> 0:34:14,619
is useful in treating.


657
0:34:14,619 --> 0:34:18,47
Most people tend to take cannabis at
least in the evening


658
0:34:18,47 --> 0:34:20,869
some people take it more often than that


659
0:34:20,869 --> 0:34:25,579
and the reason is that many of these
conditions interfere with sleep and then


660
0:34:25,579 --> 0:34:30,849
there are some people who just have
sleep problems, have insomnia difficulty.


661
0:34:30,849 --> 0:34:34,499
Cannabis is very useful assisting people
and going to sleep.


662
0:34:34,499 --> 0:34:37,26
Now if they have difficulty staying
asleep


663
0:34:37,26 --> 0:34:38,36
in addition to


664
0:34:38,36 --> 0:34:42,229
smoking or vaporizing or using it sublingually


665
0:34:42,229 --> 0:34:47,159
they should also use it as an edible or
drink it because it will kick in


666
0:34:47,159 --> 0:34:49,519
45 minutes into their sleep


667
0:34:49,519 --> 0:34:56,849
and it will be affective for about 5
to 6 hours.


668
0:34:56,849 --> 0:34:58,109
There are a number of was


669
0:34:58,109 --> 0:35:0,8
of administering


670
0:35:0,8 --> 0:35:3,189
cannabis.


671
0:35:3,189 --> 0:35:6,359
Smoking and vaporizing cause the


672
0:35:6,359 --> 0:35:9,119
chemicals to get into the body upstream


673
0:35:9,119 --> 0:35:9,88
of the liver.


674
0:35:9,88 --> 0:35:12,889
So you have unmetabolized cannabinoids


675
0:35:12,889 --> 0:35:15,359
that are going to the brain.


676
0:35:15,359 --> 0:35:20,48
Now this doesn't mean that when the cannabinoids
go to the liver that they


677
0:35:20,48 --> 0:35:22,439
are inactivated


678
0:35:22,439 --> 0:35:26,449
but it means that they're different
85 percent of the cannabinoid is


679
0:35:26,449 --> 0:35:30,789
metabolize on its first pass to
liver.


680
0:35:30,789 --> 0:35:32,739
The other thing is that


681
0:35:32,739 --> 0:35:36,809
when it goes to the brain immediately
by the


682
0:35:36,809 --> 0:35:38,26
respitory route of administration


683
0:35:38,26 --> 0:35:41,22
the effect will be in 15-30
seconds.


684
0:35:41,22 --> 0:35:44,489
Whereas if we wait for it to go through the GI Tract


685
0:35:44,489 --> 0:35:45,529
to deliver


686
0:35:45,529 --> 0:35:49,829
it will take 45 minutes before
its effective.


687
0:35:49,829 --> 0:35:52,239
Now each one of those routes of
administration


688
0:35:52,239 --> 0:35:54,339
is going to give you a slightly different


689
0:35:54,339 --> 0:35:56,319
mix of chemicals


690
0:35:56,319 --> 0:35:57,959
because when you smoke it you


691
0:35:57,959 --> 0:35:58,94
are oxygenating the chemicals that are in there.


692
0:35:58,94 --> 0:36:2,7
So when you are vaporizing


693
0:36:2,7 --> 0:36:7,43
the cannabinoids that are behind where


694
0:36:7,43 --> 0:36:8,769
the flame is


695
0:36:8,769 --> 0:36:12,309
you're also burning


696
0:36:12,309 --> 0:36:13,42
them right at the


697
0:36:13,42 --> 0:36:14,38
junction.


698
0:36:14,38 --> 0:36:19,42
So that smoked marijuana is not identical
to vaporizing marijuana.


699
0:36:19,42 --> 0:36:24,169
With the vaporized marijuana all the
volitalized oils


700
0:36:24,169 --> 0:36:27,899
will be vaporized by the time you get to 340 degrees C


701
0:36:27,899 --> 0:36:28,909
...


702
0:36:28,909 --> 0:36:30,219
You will have removed


703
0:36:30,219 --> 0:36:34,92
or been exposed to about 70
percent fewer irritants


704
0:36:34,92 --> 0:36:36,419
then when you smoke it.


705
0:36:36,419 --> 0:36:40,699
It also has a somewhat different odor
it doesn't have the characteristic


706
0:36:40,699 --> 0:36:42,41
classic burn rope odor


707
0:36:42,41 --> 0:36:43,92
it has more of a 


708
0:36:43,92 --> 0:36:45,59
nutty odor.


709
0:36:45,59 --> 0:36:47,18
Now when you eat marijuana


710
0:36:47,18 --> 0:36:52,99
you're going to have metabolized
85 percent of cannabinoids.


711
0:36:52,99 --> 0:36:52,819
People


712
0:36:52,819 --> 0:36:56,799
who eat it talk about having a body high as
opposed to


713
0:36:56,799 --> 0:36:58,22
mind high.


714
0:36:58,22 --> 0:37:3,679
That is because you are being exposed to
different combination of cannabinoids.


715
0:37:3,679 --> 0:37:7,25
Now some people have found that an
under the tongue spray


716
0:37:7,25 --> 0:37:8,149
which is


717
0:37:8,149 --> 0:37:10,24
what Sativex is,


718
0:37:10,24 --> 0:37:14,479
SAtivex is analcohol extract of the
whole plant


719
0:37:14,479 --> 0:37:16,209
which combines


720
0:37:16,209 --> 0:37:19,579
extracts from two plants one that is high in THC


721
0:37:19,579 --> 0:37:21,209
for it's theraputic value


722
0:37:21,209 --> 0:37:24,999
and another that is high in CBD


723
0:37:24,999 --> 0:37:26,769
to keep down the


724
0:37:26,769 --> 0:37:31,349
euphoria.


725
0:37:31,349 --> 0:37:36,789
When you spray it under the tongue it will be
effective in about 15 minutes


726
0:37:36,789 --> 0:37:42,839
But it will go to the brain first before going
through the liver.


727
0:37:42,839 --> 0:37:46,4
On the other hand there are many people in canada where
Sativex is legal


728
0:37:46,4 --> 0:37:48,88
that find that they still preferr


729
0:37:48,88 --> 0:37:49,859
cannabis


730
0:37:49,859 --> 0:37:51,929
to Sativex


731
0:37:51,929 --> 0:37:53,959
Now sativex


732
0:37:53,959 --> 0:37:56,309
is prescribed in canada


733
0:37:56,309 --> 0:37:58,199
and it appears as though


734
0:37:58,199 --> 0:38:2,649
the british government and or the
spanish government might also approve


735
0:38:2,649 --> 0:38:5,1
sativex in the near future


736
0:38:5,1 --> 0:38:7,84
for sale as a pharmaceutical


737
0:38:7,84 --> 0:38:10,729
in their country.


738
0:38:10,729 --> 0:38:15,94
The US food drug administration (FDA)found
that Sativex, basically liquid marijuana


739
0:38:15,94 --> 0:38:21,289
was safe enough to be tested on
americans and they approved a phase 3


740
0:38:21,289 --> 0:38:25,349
clinical study, phase 3 just means
human beings, in


741
0:38:25,349 --> 0:38:27,509
december of 2005


742
0:38:27,509 --> 0:38:33,329
to determine whether or not this under
the tongue tincture spray was useful in


743
0:38:33,329 --> 0:38:35,45
 intractable pain of


744
0:38:35,45 --> 0:38:36,849
people with cancer.


745
0:38:36,849 --> 0:38:42,599
This study did not gets started until
2007 and still on going.


746
0:38:42,599 --> 0:38:47,569
There have been numerous studies with
cannabis and tincture of cannabis


747
0:38:47,569 --> 0:38:49,349
and pain that have shown it


748
0:38:49,349 --> 0:38:51,1
is useful in


749
0:38:51,1 --> 0:38:53,389
releaving pain.


750
0:38:53,389 --> 0:38:57,679
We talked about under the tongue we've
talked about smoking talked about being


751
0:38:57,679 --> 0:38:58,529
vaporization.


752
0:38:58,529 --> 0:39:0,19
There's also


753
0:39:0,19 --> 0:39:1,839
these synthetic delta 9 THC


754
0:39:1,839 --> 0:39:5,969
that can be taken orally just like edibles.


755
0:39:5,969 --> 0:39:7,79
...


756
0:39:7,79 --> 0:39:10,329
The main problem with edibles is that


757
0:39:10,329 --> 0:39:14,9
it's hard to tell whether you're going
to get a dose that is going to just deal


758
0:39:14,9 --> 0:39:17,9
with the therapeutic needs that you have


759
0:39:17,9 --> 0:39:20,91
whether it's going to give you euphoria 
or whether it is going to give you disphoria


760
0:39:20,91 --> 0:39:22,14
you need to have


761
0:39:22,14 --> 0:39:25,29
the regular supply so that you


762
0:39:25,29 --> 0:39:28,689
can be fairly certain that you're going
to take the amount that will be the


763
0:39:28,689 --> 0:39:34,479
therapeutic dose and not an amount that will
give you dysphoric


764
0:39:34,479 --> 0:39:35,829
side-effects.


765
0:39:35,829 --> 0:39:37,349
Lastly


766
0:39:37,349 --> 0:39:40,13
the .... who are healers in


767
0:39:40,13 --> 0:39:43,59
southern mexico and central america


768
0:39:43,59 --> 0:39:46,359
have used tincture of cannabis as part of their


769
0:39:46,359 --> 0:39:48,269
therapeutic ...


770
0:39:48,269 --> 0:39:53,579
for at least 200 years.
The topical application of tincture of cannabis


771
0:39:53,579 --> 0:39:56,48
is useful particularly on the small joints


772
0:39:56,48 --> 0:39:57,93
the fingers and toes


773
0:39:57,93 --> 0:40:1,489
in dealing with pain associated with
arthritis


774
0:40:1,489 --> 0:40:4,819
and the reason for this is that cannabis


775
0:40:4,819 --> 0:40:6,609
is both an Analgesic,


776
0:40:6,609 --> 0:40:9,109
a painkiller and anti-inflammatory


777
0:40:9,109 --> 0:40:13,769
and we know this not only from the
evidence that we have


778
0:40:13,769 --> 0:40:18,38
but also from thousands of studies have
been done around the world


779
0:40:18,38 --> 0:40:19,249
with


780
0:40:19,249 --> 0:40:24,17
mainly with animals and sometimes tissue
culture.


781
0:40:24,17 --> 0:40:28,549
International Cannabinoid research society's
been around for about 20 years


782
0:40:28,549 --> 0:40:30,799
and the have


783
0:40:30,799 --> 0:40:34,9
conferences each year the last three
days in which researchers from all over


784
0:40:34,9 --> 0:40:35,309
the world


785
0:40:35,309 --> 0:40:39,959
talk about the results they have gotten


786
0:40:39,959 --> 0:40:41,829
doing basic science studies.


787
0:40:41,829 --> 0:40:42,869
Any drug 


788
0:40:42,869 --> 0:40:46,359
that a doctors considering
recommending or prescribing they need to


789
0:40:46,359 --> 0:40:50,49
balance off the therapeutic effects with
the side-effects.


790
0:40:50,49 --> 0:40:53,8
When you talk about the treatment of
pain for many people


791
0:40:53,8 --> 0:40:57,19
the opiates are very effective pain
killers


792
0:40:57,19 --> 0:40:58,599
but for some people


793
0:40:58,599 --> 0:41:3,43
the opiates cause confusion they make it
difficult for them to concentrate


794
0:41:3,43 --> 0:41:5,38
difficult for them to drive


795
0:41:5,38 --> 0:41:8,509
they don't enjoy playing with their kids
and their grandkids


796
0:41:8,509 --> 0:41:11,409
it causes them constipation.


797
0:41:11,409 --> 0:41:12,839
with cannabis


798
0:41:12,839 --> 0:41:17,89
for many of those people they find
that it certainly does not give them


799
0:41:17,89 --> 0:41:18,79
constipation


800
0:41:18,79 --> 0:41:20,659
and does not cause them confusion


801
0:41:20,659 --> 0:41:23,459
provides them with sufficient relief
from their pain


802
0:41:23,459 --> 0:41:27,129
that they can go about their activities
of daily living they can drive their car


803
0:41:27,129 --> 0:41:29,169
without the interference


804
0:41:29,169 --> 0:41:32,389
and more importantly they can have fun
they can play with their children they


805
0:41:32,389 --> 0:41:35,309
can play with their grandchildren.


806
0:41:35,309 --> 0:41:38,619
I wouldn't necessarily say that
across the board


807
0:41:38,619 --> 0:41:42,829
cannabis is to be used instead of
opiates


808
0:41:42,829 --> 0:41:47,3
but I would say that for many people it
can be used to instead of opiates


809
0:41:47,3 --> 0:41:50,46
and for others it can be used in
conjunction with opiates and they can


810
0:41:50,46 --> 0:41:52,73
use a lower dose of the opiates


811
0:41:52,73 --> 0:41:57,489
and hopefully have fewer side effects.


812
0:41:57,489 --> 0:41:58,17
Now any theriputic agent


813
0:41:58,17 --> 0:41:59,489
that we know of


814
0:41:59,489 --> 0:42:1,109
has some side effects


815
0:42:1,109 --> 0:42:3,749
and marijuana is no exception.


816
0:42:3,749 --> 0:42:5,42
The main side-effect to the


817
0:42:5,42 --> 0:42:6,66
use of marijuana


818
0:42:6,66 --> 0:42:9,249
is from smoking it and that is cough.


819
0:42:9,249 --> 0:42:11,229
So that can be completely avoid


820
0:42:11,229 --> 0:42:13,479
by easting it or drinking


821
0:42:13,479 --> 0:42:17,119
and it can be largly avoided by vaporizing it.


822
0:42:17,119 --> 0:42:19,419
One of the things that is talked about a lot


823
0:42:19,419 --> 0:42:24,39
is that you can have a panic reaction and that is 


824
0:42:24,39 --> 0:42:26,209
possible it most commonly occurs


825
0:42:26,209 --> 0:42:27,4
in  people who


826
0:42:27,4 --> 0:42:29,109
are novices users.


827
0:42:29,109 --> 0:42:29,43
Particularly


828
0:42:29,43 --> 0:42:31,929
if they've been exposed to plant


829
0:42:31,929 --> 0:42:35,18
that is very high in THC.


830
0:42:35,18 --> 0:42:36,849
Another thing that


831
0:42:36,849 --> 0:42:38,999
people sometimes have is


832
0:42:38,999 --> 0:42:40,829
paranoid thinking


833
0:42:40,829 --> 0:42:42,399
police are after them.


834
0:42:42,399 --> 0:42:44,16
I've noticed that this is not nearly


835
0:42:44,16 --> 0:42:48,239
used common since it has become legal
becausethe police are not after them


836
0:42:48,239 --> 0:42:50,819
and so it may not be paranoia


837
0:42:50,819 --> 0:42:52,899
that people were experiencing but


838
0:42:52,899 --> 0:42:56,819
an exaggerated perception of reality


839
0:42:56,819 --> 0:42:57,779
and one of the things 


840
0:42:57,779 --> 0:43:2,229
we have lost as a result of the


841
0:43:2,229 --> 0:43:5,729
propaganda miss information that is
spread about cannabis


842
0:43:5,729 --> 0:43:10,59
is the fact that it has legitimate
therapeutic value and we have


843
0:43:10,59 --> 0:43:11,939
discouraged research.


844
0:43:11,939 --> 0:43:15,369
We have a dramatic discouraged research
in this country and


845
0:43:15,369 --> 0:43:19,9
numerous other countries including


846
0:43:19,9 --> 0:43:20,709
england israel spain


847
0:43:20,709 --> 0:43:21,319
germany


848
0:43:21,319 --> 0:43:24,639
are far ahead of us in terms of


849
0:43:24,639 --> 0:43:29,9
quantity of research they are doing on the
medicinal value of cannabis.


850
0:43:29,9 --> 0:43:30,969
This is particularly alarming


851
0:43:30,969 --> 0:43:34,429
in these economic times when we certainly
could


852
0:43:34,429 --> 0:43:37,349
use the economic stimulus and


853
0:43:37,349 --> 0:43:38,189
boost that would come


854
0:43:38,189 --> 0:43:43,66
from having pharmaceutical cannabis
available in the country


855
0:43:43,66 --> 0:43:45,319
as it is now in Canada


856
0:43:45,319 --> 0:43:47,699
and possibly soon will be


857
0:43:47,699 --> 0:43:49,809
england and spain.


858
0:43:49,809 --> 0:43:51,699
Jefferson said that


859
0:43:51,699 --> 0:43:57,459
this country would be in dire straits if
we have laws that


860
0:43:57,459 --> 0:44:0,709
interfered with what we put into our own
bodies.


861
0:44:0,709 --> 0:44:2,229
Are we not


862
0:44:2,229 --> 0:44:5,959
in control of our own bodies?


863
0:44:5,959 --> 0:44:20,919
If the people let the government decide what foods they eat
and what medicines they take, their bidies will soon be in as sorry a state as are the souls of those who love under tyrany
Quote- Thomas Jefferson

Make the most of the Indian Hemp seed and sow it everywhere.
Quote- George Washington


865
0:44:35,679 --> 0:44:43,949
...


866
0:44:43,949 --> 0:44:46,949
...


867
0:44:46,949 --> 0:44:51,309
Marijuana is a medicine that patients themselves can grow.


868
0:44:51,309 --> 0:44:55,489
For people with cancer who may be
facing


869
0:44:55,489 --> 0:44:58,899
thinking about the end of their life to
be able to grow


870
0:44:58,899 --> 0:45:5,14
a plant in work in the garden and
produce their own medicine is very empowering.


871
0:45:5,14 --> 0:45:6,279
Something that


872
0:45:6,279 --> 0:45:10,569
I think does a patient a lot of good.


873
0:45:10,569 --> 0:45:12,1
Marijuana is illegal


874
0:45:12,1 --> 0:45:13,169
and the government


875
0:45:13,169 --> 0:45:16,9
does not sponsor this kind of research.


876
0:45:16,9 --> 0:45:19,209
In view of the fact that large
numbers of people are 


877
0:45:19,209 --> 0:45:23,789
using marijuana medicinally I think
it's a shame that


878
0:45:23,789 --> 0:45:29,149
there is no investment in this kind of
research.


879
0:45:29,149 --> 0:45:31,339
I think that there is a very bright future


880
0:45:31,339 --> 0:45:33,529
for medical cannabis in this country.


881
0:45:33,529 --> 0:45:36,259
I grew up around drugs


882
0:45:36,259 --> 0:45:40,749
but to me drugs are a good thing. I walked into
building 


883
0:45:40,749 --> 0:45:43,519
everyday almost of my


884
0:45:43,519 --> 0:45:46,489
first 18 years that had a 13 foot tall sign that said


885
0:45:46,489 --> 0:45:49,869
Drugs... my father was a
pharmacist and


886
0:45:49,869 --> 0:45:52,9
we sold medication.


887
0:45:52,9 --> 0:45:55,789
As far as I am concerned medication is helpful to people


888
0:45:55,789 --> 0:45:57,739
I don't think that


889
0:45:57,739 --> 0:46:1,91
medication has personality and sits on
the self until


890
0:46:1,91 --> 0:46:4,169
you prescribe it for somebody.


891
0:46:4,169 --> 0:46:6,29
It has


892
0:46:6,29 --> 0:46:6,51
beneficial use


893
0:46:6,51 --> 0:46:28,38
and has side effects and should only be used
when necessary.


894
0:46:28,38 --> 0:46:32,63
...


895
0:46:32,63 --> 0:46:33,69
...


896
0:46:33,69 --> 0:46:39,939
...


897
0:46:39,939 --> 0:46:43,299
...


898
0:46:43,299 --> 0:46:48,199
...


899
0:46:48,199 --> 0:46:55,789
...


900
0:46:55,789 --> 0:48:55,789
...
