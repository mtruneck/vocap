Yeah, sure. I'll set the video.

- 'I'm not. '

I respect your music. It's just...

for our track that is so good

he physically couldn't do it.

in penny loafers and blue pool tables.

Well, you're kind of
making me say that but...


146
0:8:50,197 --> 0:8:57,517

definitely not pyramid selling, OK?


147

Right. Good.

this heart of holiday pay

0:10:50,237 --> 0:10:53,317
That's so Barbara. She's such a racist.


180
0:10:53,317 --> 0:10:56,357
Huh, huh. Right. Exactly.


181
0:10:56,357 --> 0:11:0,477
Listen, Sophie, I was wondering
if I could get your home number.


182
0:11:0,477 --> 0:11:5,477
I mean, for work, in case I need to
swap a shift or... That is, if you don't...


183
0:11:5,477 --> 0:11:7,677
No, I don't, if that's what you want.


184
0:11:7,677 --> 0:11:11,477
'She's actually writing it. '


185
0:11:11,477 --> 0:11:14,517
There you go. See you later.


186
0:11:14,517 --> 0:11:18,197
Oh, hang on. This isn't enough numbers.


187
0:11:18,197 --> 0:11:21,237
Oh, no, it is enough numbers.


188
0:11:21,237 --> 0:11:25,237
'Oh, God, I hope she doesn't mind
about my balls. '


189
0:11:25,237 --> 0:11:30,117
'One step out of line. The slightest hint
of maverick behaviour and you're out. '


190
0:11:30,117 --> 0:11:35,397
Exactly. If it's such a bad thing to do
things by the book, there'd be no book.


191
0:11:35,397 --> 0:11:40,997
'Must keep an eye on him if
he gets it. JLB doesn't need a maverick. '


192
0:11:40,997 --> 0:11:45,637
- So anyway, things went rather well -
- I bet he did it.


193
0:11:45,637 --> 0:11:47,997
Oh, what? Just because he's black?


194
0:11:47,997 --> 0:11:50,37
No, I mean, not because...


195
0:11:50,37 --> 0:11:53,877
- He was at the garage at the beginning.
- I know what you meant.


196
0:11:53,877 --> 0:11:57,357
Anyway, in the end,
I got Sophie's number.


197
0:11:57,357 --> 0:12:0,717
We know he's the only one
with the key to the lock-up.


198
0:12:0,717 --> 0:12:4,677
So do you think I should give her a call?
I probably should.


199
0:12:4,677 --> 0:12:7,757
- I don't know if I should.
- Maybe you should.


200
0:12:7,757 --> 0:12:13,317
OK, listen, if God's doing mountains
or sky or water, I'll call.


201
0:12:13,317 --> 0:12:19,917
- If he's doing trees or critters, I won't.
- All right, let God decide. Ready?


202
0:12:19,917 --> 0:12:21,957
Yeah, sky!


203
0:12:21,957 --> 0:12:24,877
Right, here goes.


204
0:12:24,877 --> 0:12:27,877
'And with a large brush,
I'm gonna... '


205
0:12:27,877 --> 0:12:33,957
'The following names were
presented to us by temping agencies. '


206
0:12:33,957 --> 0:12:36,517
- Answerphone.
- Ah, you see!


207
0:12:36,517 --> 0:12:38,797
He did do it, but for a nice reason.


208
0:12:38,797 --> 0:12:41,437
Who's the racist now, Mark?


209
0:12:41,437 --> 0:12:45,877
Er, Sophie. If you heard that,
please ignore it. I'm not a racist.


210
0:12:45,877 --> 0:12:47,917
Far from it.


211
0:12:47,917 --> 0:12:49,957
Anyway...


212
0:12:49,957 --> 0:12:53,837
It's good to hear your voice.
I know it's only a recording


213
0:12:53,837 --> 0:12:57,837
but you have got a bloody nice voice


214
0:12:57,837 --> 0:13:0,237
and...


215
0:13:0,237 --> 0:13:4,837
God, I just called up to say hi and then...


216
0:13:4,837 --> 0:13:10,717
? Then I go and spoil it all
by saying something stupid like...


217
0:13:10,717 --> 0:13:12,757
? I like you?


218
0:13:12,757 --> 0:13:14,797
I mean, not that.


219
0:13:14,797 --> 0:13:17,117
But anyway...


220
0:13:17,117 --> 0:13:22,317
I noticed that the paper in
the photocopier is running a bit low so...


221
0:13:22,317 --> 0:13:24,957
I know it's not really your job but...


222
0:13:24,957 --> 0:13:28,157
You know, so... See you tomorrow.


223
0:13:28,157 --> 0:13:29,917
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!


224
0:13:29,917 --> 0:13:31,357
- Oh, fuck!
- Oh, my God.


225
0:13:31,357 --> 0:13:34,837
- Jesus!
- I've really fucked it. Have I fucked it?


226
0:13:34,837 --> 0:13:36,677
Maybe it was charming.


227
0:13:36,677 --> 0:13:41,357
- It was the behaviour of an oddball.
- No, not an oddball. A maverick.


228
0:13:41,357 --> 0:13:43,837
You may not play by the rules, but...


229
0:13:43,837 --> 0:13:45,877
by Christ, you get results.


230
0:13:45,877 --> 0:13:49,317
Come on, let's go and have a drink.
Forget about it.


231
0:13:49,317 --> 0:13:52,397
Have you forgotten about
the phone call yet?


232
0:13:52,397 --> 0:13:55,437
- No.
- Right.


233
0:13:55,437 --> 0:14:0,157
How much washing-up do you think
you could do without washing-up liquid?


234
0:14:0,157 --> 0:14:5,237
- I'm sorry?
- Exactly. And friends and colleagues?


235
0:14:5,237 --> 0:14:7,637
Everyone needs cleaning products


236
0:14:7,637 --> 0:14:10,397
and that's never gonna change, right?


237
0:14:10,397 --> 0:14:14,597
- Why are you talking like this?
- Very interesting question.


238
0:14:14,597 --> 0:14:18,237
The first thing to say is
that this is not pyramid selling.


239
0:14:18,237 --> 0:14:21,597
- You're doing pyramid selling?
- Not pyramid selling.


240
0:14:21,597 --> 0:14:27,757
- I can't believe you're pyramid selling.
- Listen, it's not, it's network marketing


241
0:14:27,757 --> 0:14:30,437
and it's a guaranteed money-making...


242
0:14:30,437 --> 0:14:33,117
- I've seen the charts.
- Oh, the charts.


243
0:14:33,117 --> 0:14:38,917
- You didn't tell me about the charts!
- Are you trying to piss on my bonfire?


244
0:14:38,917 --> 0:14:41,277
I'm trying to protect you from...


245
0:14:41,277 --> 0:14:43,157
pissing all over yourself.


246
0:14:43,157 --> 0:14:47,877
I'm not about to piss
all over myself. I'm...


247
0:14:47,877 --> 0:14:50,117
I'm pissing... into the big time.


248
0:14:50,117 --> 0:14:54,77
- You're still coming to the interview.
- Well, I thought...


249
0:14:54,77 --> 0:14:59,37
Listen, Jeremy. You don't understand.
Nothing you want will ever happen.


250
0:14:59,37 --> 0:15:4,37
That's the real world. Your hair isn't red.
People don't walk on stilts.


251
0:15:4,37 --> 0:15:9,157
Maybe somewhere, you can earn a living
drinking margaritas through a straw


252
0:15:9,157 --> 0:15:12,997
but in this world, you've got to turn up,
log on and grind out.


253
0:15:12,997 --> 0:15:14,957
But if you get in early...


254
0:15:14,957 --> 0:15:18,277
Come Friday,
you will owe me three months' rent.


255
0:15:18,277 --> 0:15:20,357
You're coming to the interview.


256
0:15:20,357 --> 0:15:22,477
OK.


257
0:15:22,477 --> 0:15:27,237
'I'll come to the interview,
all right, but I won't be getting the job. '


258
0:15:27,237 --> 0:15:29,277
What?


259
0:15:29,277 --> 0:15:31,317
Er, nothing, just...


260
0:15:31,317 --> 0:15:33,357
something funny.


261
0:15:33,357 --> 0:15:46,37
Can you...?


262
0:15:46,37 --> 0:15:49,597
'Maybe she did find it charming.
Yeah, maybe.


263
0:15:49,597 --> 0:15:55,237
'Just work out her... I could say
Jeremy had a gun and made me sing it


264
0:15:55,237 --> 0:15:58,957
'because he's a crackhead
and he does that all the time.


265
0:15:58,957 --> 0:16:3,357
'Yeah, that sounds great - me in my
crack house. You can be a crack bitch


266
0:16:3,357 --> 0:16:5,197
'and sit on my... Shit!


267
0:16:5,197 --> 0:16:9,997
'Shit, piss, poo, pants, bollocks.
Yes, blitzkrieg! I'm in the Ardennes!


268
0:16:9,997 --> 0:16:14,277
'You can't touch me in the Ardennes,
concealed in the cupboard.


269
0:16:14,277 --> 0:16:19,277
'Everything's OK in the cupboard.
I'm safe in the cupboard. '


270
0:16:19,277 --> 0:16:21,317
Mark?


271
0:16:21,317 --> 0:16:25,357
- You're in the stationery cupboard.
- That's right, Jeff.


272
0:16:25,357 --> 0:16:28,397
OK... Right.


273
0:16:28,397 --> 0:16:30,157
Well...


274
0:16:30,157 --> 0:16:33,557
- I hope you're having a good time.
- Yeah, well...


275
0:16:33,557 --> 0:16:35,597
Hi, Mark.


276
0:16:35,597 --> 0:16:37,637
Hi... Sophie.


277
0:16:37,637 --> 0:16:40,277
I'm just in the cupboard right now.


278
0:16:40,277 --> 0:16:52,677
- About the message, we'll talk later, OK?
- Er, yeah, fine.


279
0:16:52,677 --> 0:16:57,277
'Here we go. Operation Come Over
Like An Unemployable Freak. '


280
0:16:57,277 --> 0:16:59,37
Jeremy Osbourne?


281
0:16:59,37 --> 0:17:2,557
Hi, I'm Barbara.
Do you want to walk this way?


282
0:17:2,557 --> 0:17:4,597
Right you are.


283
0:17:4,597 --> 0:17:8,357
I might wobble
because I'm a bit pissed from last night


284
0:17:8,357 --> 0:17:11,477
and I don't want to get your hopes up
cos I must say...


285
0:17:11,477 --> 0:17:16,437
- I'm only really here because...
- Obviously you know Mark Corrigan.


286
0:17:16,437 --> 0:17:20,157
- 'Oh, shit. '
- Mark would be one of your managers.


287
0:17:20,157 --> 0:17:24,637
'Must be careful. Don't want the job
or to piss off the land baron. '


288
0:17:24,637 --> 0:17:27,357
'He looks like crap. '


289
0:17:27,357 --> 0:17:31,117
We have to make sure
we've ticked all the boxes, so to speak


290
0:17:31,117 --> 0:17:33,757
and kept everything above board.


291
0:17:33,757 --> 0:17:38,917
So if I can outline the basic requirements
of the role you'll be undertaking.


292
0:17:38,917 --> 0:17:43,837
You'll be responsible for updating
and maintaining the filing system.


293
0:17:43,837 --> 0:17:47,877
That may not sound important
but the truth is...


294
0:17:47,877 --> 0:17:51,517
'Shit, what's she talking about?
Nod. Look serious.


295
0:17:51,517 --> 0:17:53,957
'I'm Di, she's Bashir. '


296
0:17:53,957 --> 0:17:56,437
...whole company communicates...


297
0:17:56,437 --> 0:17:59,677
'He'll be able
to pay off the Blockbusters fine,


298
0:17:59,677 --> 0:18:2,277
'plus I'll be able to order him around.


299
0:18:2,277 --> 0:18:6,397
'Not horrible, just...
"Jeremy, could you file this for me?


300
0:18:6,397 --> 0:18:8,917
"'Jeremy, could you take that for me?


301
0:18:8,917 --> 0:18:13,717
"'Jeremy, could you suck this for me... "
Jesus! Where did that come from? '


302
0:18:13,717 --> 0:18:17,357
It's a valuable asset.
Do you have any experience in this field?


303
0:18:17,357 --> 0:18:19,797
Er, I've done quite a lot, actually.


304
0:18:19,797 --> 0:18:23,997
I mean, not formal filing
but alphabeti-pi-cising the videos,


305
0:18:23,997 --> 0:18:26,77
doing the spices...


306
0:18:26,77 --> 0:18:29,797
I'd want to build on that experience
in a professional zone.


307
0:18:29,797 --> 0:18:32,77
Sphere. I meant sphere.


308
0:18:32,77 --> 0:18:36,837
'God, that sounded amazing!
Don't accidentally get the bugger. '


309
0:18:36,837 --> 0:18:40,717
We're doing great.


310
0:18:40,717 --> 0:18:43,637
So, I see you used to be a nurse.


311
0:18:43,637 --> 0:18:46,637
Wouldn't filing be a bit of a step down?


312
0:18:46,637 --> 0:18:49,717
Yeah, I suppose it would, actually,


313
0:18:49,717 --> 0:18:53,637
although I'm looking for something
more relaxing.


314
0:18:53,637 --> 0:18:55,877
Challenging. He means, challenging.


315
0:18:55,877 --> 0:18:59,437
- I expect Jeremy knows what he means.
- Yes, right.


316
0:18:59,437 --> 0:19:1,477
No, challenging is right


317
0:19:1,477 --> 0:19:5,77
but a bit more of a relaxing challenge.


318
0:19:5,77 --> 0:19:9,117
More like doing a crossword
than a tracheotomy.


319
0:19:9,117 --> 0:19:11,157
- Right.
- 'Oh, shit.


320
0:19:11,157 --> 0:19:17,517
'My natural bloody charm's
only swinging it. Got to do something. '


321
0:19:17,517 --> 0:19:19,837
- Are you OK?
- What?


322
0:19:19,837 --> 0:19:22,277
- It's just a thing I have.
- What thing?


323
0:19:22,277 --> 0:19:24,117
Facial spasming.


324
0:19:24,117 --> 0:19:27,317
Facial spa... You do not have...


325
0:19:27,317 --> 0:19:30,277
- I do... sometimes.
- Well, er...


326
0:19:30,277 --> 0:19:35,357
I guess that's everything. Jeremy,
is there anything you'd like to ask?


327
0:19:35,357 --> 0:19:37,397
Yes, Barbara. Yes, there is.


328
0:19:37,397 --> 0:19:42,957
How much washing-up do you think you
could do without any washing-up liquid?


329
0:19:42,957 --> 0:19:45,757
- No, Jeremy.
- Where's this...?


330
0:19:45,757 --> 0:19:50,37
- It's a unique business opportunity.
- It's pyramid selling.


331
0:19:50,37 --> 0:19:52,797
- It's not pyramid selling, Mark.
- It is.


332
0:19:52,797 --> 0:19:55,637
- You're making a fool of yourself.
- You're pissing on my bonfire!


333
0:19:55,637 --> 0:19:58,877
- There is no bonfire!
- Because you keep pissing on it!


334
0:19:58,877 --> 0:20:1,677
Sheesh. This is low. This is really low.


335
0:20:1,677 --> 0:20:5,357
Yeah, well, at least I don't fancy
elves and pixies.


336
0:20:5,357 --> 0:20:10,437
What does that mean? I literally have
no idea what that is supposed to mean!


337
0:20:10,437 --> 0:20:12,477
OK...


338
0:20:12,477 --> 0:20:17,917
Well, thanks for coming in.
We'll be in touch.


339
0:20:17,917 --> 0:20:23,717
'Well, that was a fucking disaster.
I want reparations - brutal reparations!


340
0:20:23,717 --> 0:20:27,757
'I want the Rhineland.
It's going to be 1919 all over again.


341
0:20:27,757 --> 0:20:30,957
'Fuck the inevitable backlash!


342
0:20:30,957 --> 0:20:32,997
'OK. It's OK, Mark. Later.


343
0:20:32,997 --> 0:20:35,37
'Now, calm.


344
0:20:35,37 --> 0:20:37,997
'Calm, honest and mature. '


345
0:20:37,997 --> 0:20:39,757
Hi, Sophie.


346
0:20:39,757 --> 0:20:42,637
Hey, Mark.
I just bumped into your flatmate.


347
0:20:42,637 --> 0:20:45,957
- Oh... yeah?
- He kept talking about washing up.


348
0:20:45,957 --> 0:20:50,477
- Very funny. Like Jim Carrey.
- Huh. Yeah, I know what you mean.


349
0:20:50,477 --> 0:20:52,997
'Get your tanks off my lawn, Jeremy. '


350
0:20:52,997 --> 0:20:54,797
But listen, Sophie...


351
0:20:54,797 --> 0:21:0,397
About the message last night.
I want to kind of come clean really.


352
0:21:0,397 --> 0:21:5,277
It's a bit embarrassing but...


353
0:21:5,277 --> 0:21:7,37
Well...


354
0:21:7,37 --> 0:21:9,77
the thing is...


355
0:21:9,77 --> 0:21:14,197
Jeremy, sometimes, for a laugh,
makes me say things with a bread knife.


356
0:21:14,197 --> 0:21:17,997
- He's obviously not a crackhead but...
- Uh-huh. OK.


357
0:21:17,997 --> 0:21:20,37
Yeah.


358
0:21:20,37 --> 0:21:23,557
Look, you don't have to...
About the phone message,


359
0:21:23,557 --> 0:21:26,477
- you don't have to be embarrassed.
- I don't?


360
0:21:26,477 --> 0:21:30,397
- No, it's just one of those things.
- Is it? It is?


361
0:21:30,397 --> 0:21:32,437
Oh, right. Fantastic.


362
0:21:32,437 --> 0:21:35,597
And... you haven't told anyone about it?


363
0:21:35,597 --> 0:21:37,277
Of course not.


364
0:21:37,277 --> 0:21:42,357
- Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
- 'Calm down. She's not Pontius Pilate. '


365
0:21:42,357 --> 0:21:43,877
Yeah, well, you know...


366
0:21:43,877 --> 0:21:45,917
The truth is...


367
0:21:45,917 --> 0:21:47,957
The truth is I suppose...


368
0:21:47,957 --> 0:21:49,997
I like you.


369
0:21:49,997 --> 0:21:53,517
That's why I said the song. I like you.


370
0:21:53,517 --> 0:21:55,557
Is that such a crime?


371
0:21:55,557 --> 0:21:59,837
Should I be hounded to the ends
of the earth just for liking you?


372
0:21:59,837 --> 0:22:3,397
I like you and if you can't handle it,
you can just...


373
0:22:3,397 --> 0:22:5,237
you know...


374
0:22:5,237 --> 0:22:7,277
fuck off.


375
0:22:7,277 --> 0:22:10,37
No, no, I think I can handle you liking me.


376
0:22:10,37 --> 0:22:12,477
Good.


377
0:22:12,477 --> 0:22:19,517
Right, excellent. OK.


378
0:22:19,517 --> 0:22:30,77
Bye.


379
0:22:30,77 --> 0:22:32,837
Hi, Mark. Thanks for bringing in Jeremy.


380
0:22:32,837 --> 0:22:34,877
He was quite the find.


381
0:22:34,877 --> 0:22:36,917
Er, yeah...


382
0:22:36,917 --> 0:22:41,637
Right, I'm really sorry.
I mean, I thought it would be a good...


383
0:22:41,637 --> 0:22:44,677
that he might... but...


384
0:22:44,677 --> 0:22:46,717
Hey! Hey, there!


385
0:22:46,717 --> 0:22:49,877
Feeling better now, are we?
Fully recovered?


386
0:22:49,877 --> 0:22:51,837
Hey, I see you!


387
0:22:51,837 --> 0:22:53,877
I see you!


388
0:22:53,877 --> 0:22:56,317
He used to have a limp!


389
0:22:56,317 --> 0:22:58,637
I mean, he pretended to have a limp.


390
0:22:58,637 --> 0:23:13,317
He's a faking little pegleg!


391
0:23:13,317 --> 0:23:16,277
Hi, Jeff.


392
0:23:16,277 --> 0:23:20,37
'Well, fuck you if you're
not doing small talk. I'm not helping.


393
0:23:20,37 --> 0:23:25,797
'Let's die together. '


394
0:23:25,797 --> 0:23:31,917
? And then I go and spoil it all
by saying something stupid like


395
0:23:31,917 --> 0:23:35,597
? I like you?


396
0:23:35,597 --> 0:23:37,917
? And then I go and spoil it all


397
0:23:37,917 --> 0:23:44,917
? By saying something stupid
like I love you


398
0:23:44,917 --> 0:23:49,317
? I can see it in your eyes
that you despise the same old lies


399
0:23:49,317 --> 0:23:54,477
? You heard the night before


400
0:23:54,477 --> 0:23:58,37
? And though it's just a line to you
For me, it's true


401
0:23:58,37 --> 0:25:58,37
? And never seems so...?
