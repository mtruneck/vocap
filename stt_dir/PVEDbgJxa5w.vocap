###23 WADE DAVIS: I did what one would do, is you take all this
###26 stuff back for taxonomic identification.
###29 You look in the literature to see if there's any reports on
###32 what it might have.
###33 It was a mix, a plethora of ingredients--
###35 everything from snakes, dried toads, and various plants, and
###43 then these curious fish.
###46 HAMILTON MORRIS: While Alex arranges a meeting with a new
###48 bokor, I decide to see if I can find the ingredients Davis
###52 described on my own.
###56 WADE DAVIS: I identified the plants and the amphibians.
###59 And I finally went around to the fish guys.
###62 And I found this ichthyologist, literally with
###64 his head sort of inside this big jaw of some massive fish
###68 he was counting the teeth of or something.
###70 And he literally reached up and pulled from his shelf,
###75 between these dusty volumes of the journal of ichthyology, a
###79 copy of Ian Fleming's James Bond book, "From Russia With
###83 Love, one of those early books in the James Bond saga.
###88 007 gets kicked in the shin, and he dies.
###91 And then he turns back alive in the next book.
###93 That's how the guy in the lab introduced me to the fact that
###98 I had really landed on something.
###99 
###109 HAMILTON MORRIS: The pufferfish is a marvel of
###111 evolution and biomechanics.
###113 Its internal organs contain one of the most potent
###116 neurotoxins ever discovered.
###119 It is the TTX in the pufferfish which induces the
###123 total body flaccid paralysis, almost
###126 indistinguishable from death.
###129 WADE DAVIS: The simple identification of the fish
###132 suddenly took the whole zombie investigation from the realm
###136 of the phantasmagoric into the realm of the conceivable.
###140 
###155 The fish that were used in the poisons had a very interesting
###160 molecule in their viscera, in their liver, in their ovaries,
###167 and on the surface of the skin.
###169 And this was a neurotoxin called tetrodotoxin, which is
###173 a complex molecule.
###175 It's about 160,000 times more potent than cocaine as an
###180 anesthetic.
###182 It's about 1,000 times more toxic than potassium cyanide.
###187 A lethal dose of the pure molecule would balance on the
###190 head of a pin.
###191 But more interesting than the sheer toxicity was the way
###195 that it killed.
###196 And we knew the poison could do just what was necessary.
###199 It mechanically blocks cilium channels in the nerves, which
###203 brought on peripheral paralysis, dramatically low
###207 metabolic rates, and yet consciousness was retained
###211 until the moment of death.

###268 HAMILTON MORRIS: He got it.
###270 It's all puffed up.
###271 Oh my god.
###274 The fish is shot with a spear gun and
###276 pulled out of the water.
###277 The entry wound is close to the brain, with an exit wound
###280 in the stomach.
###281 -[SPEAKING CREOLE]
###283 -[SPEAKING CREOLE]
###284 
###291 HAMILTON MORRIS: Oh, wow.
###292 Look, he's puffing up.
###293 Much to my astonishment, when it's pulled out of the water,
###296 it begins to inflate itself, despite the two gaping holes
###300 in its body.
###301 How is this possible?
###303 I tentatively identified the fish as Diodon hystrix, a
###307 species so poisonous that people have been hospitalized
###310 for merely touching the spines.
###313 WADE DAVIS: The fish that I found in Haiti being used in
###317 these preparations were members of a pantropical order
###321 of fish called the Tetraodonitiformes, which also
###325 include the famous fugu fish of Japan,
###328 the culinary delicacy.
###329 For centuries, or certainly for generations, specially
###333 trained chefs have been preparing these toxic fish.
###338 They carefully eliminate the toxin so that the person can
###343 enjoy the nontoxic fillets of the fish.
###347 The real role of the fugu chef is not to eliminate the toxin
###353 altogether but to reduce it to the extent that the
###357 connoisseur still enjoys the effects of a mild
###361 intoxication, which include waves of
###363 euphoria, tingling sensation.
###365 It's one of the few substances that walks a fine line between
###368 food and drug.
###369 
###377 HAMILTON MORRIS: It sounds like there's a biphasic thing,
###381 where it starts out with the TTX poisoning.
###383 And then after, then they're given scopolamine or atropine.
###387 WADE DAVIS: So we've talked, for example, about the
###389 tetrodotoxin.
###391 But then what's fascinating is that, by all accounts, as the
###396 zombie comes back around, he is fed the paste of (CREOLE),
###401 the zombie's cucumber.
###403 Now this is based on datura, and it includes, of course,
###409 these tropane alkaloids, scopolamine and atropine.
###413 -[SPEAKING CREOLE]
###415 
###417 HAMILTON MORRIS: Davis hypothesized that the
###419 chemicals in the zombie cucumber were used to keep the
###423 zombie in a state of submissive confusion.
###426 There's one right there.
###427 
###431 But I'm not so sure that this is Datura stramonium.
###435 Oh, it has to be older?
###436 -Yeah.
###437 
###440 WADE DAVIS: This would be the perfect drug to kind of
###443 socialize the individual into a new state of
###448 psychosis, if you will.
###451 These are powerfully active drugs.
###454 They bring on a state of induced psychotic delirium,
###457 visions of hellfire, a burning thirst, a sensation of flight.
###463 These are the drugs of choice of every black magician and
###465 sorcerer throughout the world.
###468 And they create kind of a psychic dislocation that is
###474 described invariably by anyone who takes the drug as being
###478 incredibly terrifying.
###479 
###483 HAMILTON MORRIS: After the preparation, which consists of
###486 a de-spining and crude hepatectomy, the remaining
###490 organ meat it scrambled, salted, and
###492 served on a silver dish.
###494 WADE DAVIS: There was this enormous literature on just
###497 what these fish could do to you.
###499 It turns out by folk custom in Japan, if you succumb to fugu
###503 fish, you're laid on the ground for several days to
###506 make sure you're really dead.
###508 And there are case after case after case in the literature
###511 and in the newspapers of Japan of people nailed into their
###515 coffins by mistake.
###517 On this dish is a species of puffer, which is known to be
###521 poisonous, in October, a season where the fish is known
###525 to contain deadly quantities of TTX.
###528 Yet nobody around me seems concerned in the slightest.
###531 
###540 The meat is chewy, and I'm delighted to say, tastes
###543 almost indistinguishable from chicken.
###546 WADE DAVIS: At the time, no one really understood the
###549 biogenesis of the toxin within the fish.
###552 There was a tremendous amount of variability.
###554 And we knew that 50% of the time, these fish were not
###557 toxic at all.
###558 But what was fascinating is that this meant that at least
###563 50% of the time, these toxins would be ineffective,
###568 pharmacologically.
###568 So what's going on here?
###570 Well, that really turned out to be the key to the puzzle.
###574 Every drug, in a sense, particularly hallucinogenic
###577 drugs, they have absolutely neutral potential for good or
###581 evil, an ambivalent potential.
###583 And everything depends on the cultural matrix in which the
###588 drug is used.
