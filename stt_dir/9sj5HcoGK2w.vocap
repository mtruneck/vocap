###440 on the campus of the University of North Florida in Jacksonville. Senator Santorum, let's begin
###445 with you.
###446 >> SANTORUM: I'm Rick Santorum, and I'm thrilled to be here on the campus of North Florida.
###450 >> [LAUGHTER]
###451 >> [APPLAUSE]
###452 >> SANTORUM: And I'm especially thrilled because I'm here with a North Florida resident who
###461 lives right down the beach from Jacksonville, my mom, who is 93 years old, who is with me
###465 here tonight.
###471 >> [APPLAUSE]
###477 >> SANTORUM: I better just stop right there.
###486 >> GINGRICH: I'm Newt Gingrich, from the neighboring state of Georgia. I'm delighted to be in Jacksonville,
###493 which will be the site of the next nuclear aircraft carrier battle group.
###500 >> [APPLAUSE]
###503 >> ROMNEY: I'm Mitt Romney, and I'm pleased to be here with my wife and my oldest son
###510 Tagg Romney. We're the parents of five sons, five daughters-in-law, 16 grandkids. And it's
###515 great to be back in Jacksonville. Thank you.
###520 >> [APPLAUSE]
###522 >> RON PAUL: I'm Ron Paul. I'm a congressman from Texas, 12 terms. I am the champion of
###531 a sound monetary system, a gold standard, as it is under the Constitution, and a foreign
###536 policy based on strength which rejects the notion that we should be the policemen of
###541 the world and that we should be a nation builder.
###545 >> [APPLAUSE]
###546 >> BLITZER: All right. Let's start with a question from the audience.
###554 >> JONNA FLYN: Hello. Can you tell me what specific actions you'll take to address the
###562 costly consequences of illegal immigration while preserving the rights of those who seek
###567 to immigrate legally?
###568 >> BLITZER: All right. Senator Santorum, let's take that question. But also, in the course
###572 of that question, express your opinion on what we heard from Governor Romney, that self-deportation,
###577 or illegal immigrants leaving the country voluntarily, is a possible solution.
###582 >> SANTORUM: Well, the possible solution is -- I actually agree with Governor Romney.
###587 The bottom line is that we need to enforce the laws in this country. We are a country
###591 of laws. People come to this country. My grandfather came to this country because he wanted to
###596 come to a country that respected him. And a country that respects you is a country that
###603 lives by the laws that they have. And the first act when they come to this country,
###608 is to disobey a law, it's not a particularly welcome way to enter this country. What I've
###615 said is from the very beginning, that we -- we have to have a country that not only do you
###621 respect the law when you come here, but you respect the law when you stay here. And people
###624 who have come to this country illegally have broken the law repeatedly. If you're here,
###628 unless you're here on a trust fund, you've been working illegally. You've probably stolen
###633 someone's Social Security number, illegally. And so it's not just one thing that you've
###637 done wrong, you've done a lot of things wrong. And as a result of that, I believe that people
###641 should no -- should not be able to stay here. And so I think we need to enforce the law
###646 at the border, secure the border. Secondly, we need to have employer enforcement, which
###651 means E-verify and then we need to have not only employers sanctioned, but we have to
###655 have people who are found who are working here illegally, they need to be deported.
###659 That is again the principle of having a rule of law and living by it. I am very much in
###664 favor of immigration. I'm not someone -- my dad came to this country and I'm someone who
###668 believes that -- that we need immigration. We are not replacing ourselves. We have -- we
###673 need not only immigration for -- to keep our population going, but we need immigration
###678 because immigrants bring a vitality and a love of this country that is -- infuses this
###683 country with -- with great energy. And so, I support legal immigration, but we need to
###688 enforce the law and in fact, if you don't create an opportunity for people to work,
###692 they will leave because they can't afford to stay here.
###694 >> BLITZER: Speaker Gingrich, you've suggested that self- deportation as advocated by Governor
###700 Romney is in your words, "An Obama level fantasy." Why?
###704 >> GINGRICH: Well look, I think that first of all, you should control the border, which
###707 I have pledged to do by January 1, 2014. You should fix legal immigration in terms of visas
###714 so people can come and go easily -- more easily than doing it illegally. You should also make
###719 deportation easier so when you deport people who shouldn't be here. The 13 gang members,
###724 for example. It should be very quick and very clear. You should have a guest worker program,
###729 probably run by American Express, Visa or MasterCard so they minimize fraud, which the
###734 federal government won't do. And you should have much stronger employer penalties at that
###738 point because you can validate it. I actually agree that self-deportation will occur if
###742 you're single. If you've only been here a short time. And there are millions of people
###746 who faced with that, would go back home, file for a guest worker program and might or might
###751 not come back. The one group I singled out, were people who have been here a very long
###755 time who are married, who may well have children and grandchildren. And I would just suggest
###761 that grandmothers or grandfathers aren't likely to self-deport. And then you've got a question.
###766 I -- I offered a proposal, a citizen panel to review whether or not somebody who had
###771 been here a very long time, who had family and who had an American family willing to
###776 sponsor them, should be allowed to get residency, but not citizenship so that they would be
###781 able to stay within the law, but would not have any chance of becoming a citizen, unless
###785 they went back home. I don't think grandmothers and grandfathers will self-deport.
###790 >> BLITZER: Governor Romney, the few times and I think it was only once, that they experimented
###794 with self-deportation, only a handful of individuals voluntarily left. What makes you think that
###799 -- that program could work?
###801 >> ROMNEY: Well, you've just heard the last two speakers also indicate that they support
###804 the concept of self-deportation. It's very simply this, which is for those who come into
###808 the country legally, they would be given an identification card that points out they're
###813 able to work here and then you have an E-verify system that's effective and efficient so that
###818 employers can determine who is legally here and if employers hire someone without a card,
###822 or without checking to see if it's been counterfeited, then those employers would be severely sanctioned.
###828 If you do that, people who have come here illegally won't be able to find work. And
###831 over time, those people would tend to leave the country, or self-deport. I don't think
###835 anyone is interested in going around and rounding up people around the country and deporting
###839 11 million Americans -- or, excuse me 11 million illegal immigrants into America. Now, let's
###844 look at -- and -- and I know people said, but isn't that unfair to those 11 million
###847 that are here and have lived their lives here and perhaps raised children here? But I think
###851 it's important to remember, that there are three groups of people that are of concern
###855 to us. One are those that have come here illegally, 11 million. The second is the group of people
###860 who are brought over by coyotes and who are in many cases abused by virtue of coming into
###865 this country illegally. And the third, are the four to five million people who are waiting
###869 at home in their own nations trying to get here legally. They have family members here
###875 asking them to come here. Grandparents and uncles and aunts. Those are the people we
###879 have a responsibility for. And the second group as well, those that are abused. We -- we're
###883 concerned about them. Let's focus our attention on how to make legal immigration work and
###888 stop illegal immigration.
###889 >> BLITZER: All right. Governor Paul -- sorry, excuse me, Congressman Paul you're from Texas.
###894 The state with the longest border with Mexico. Is this a viable option, what we just heard?
###899 >> PAUL: Well, I'd talk about it, but I don't see it as being very practical. I think it's
###904 a much bigger problem. You can't deal with immigration without dealing with the economy.
###909 The weaker the economy, the more resentment there is when illegals come in. If you have
###913 a healthy, vibrant economy, it's not a problem; we're usually looking for workers. Even under
###918 today's circumstances, a lot of businesses are looking for workers and they don't have
###922 them. They're not as well-trained here. But also, the way we're handling our borders is
###927 actually hurting our economy because the businesspeople -- you know, visitors have a hard time coming
###935 in. I mean, we don't have a well-managed border. So I think we need more resources and I think
###940 most of the other candidates would agree we need more resources. But where are the resources
###945 going to come from? I have a suggestion. I think we spend way too much time worrying
###950 about the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Use some of those resources on our own border.
###956 >> [APPLAUSE]
###957 >> BLITZER: Speaker Gingrich, you had an ad, but you pulled it this week, in which you
###961 described Governor Romney as the most anti- immigrant candidate. Why did you do that?
###966 >> GINGRICH: Why did we describe him that way? Because, in the original conversations
###971 about deportation, the position I took, which he attacked pretty ferociously, was that grandmothers
###976 and grandfathers aren't going to be successfully deported. We're not -- we as a nation are
###981 not going to walk into some family -- and by the way, they're going to end up in a church,
###985 which will declare them a sanctuary. We're not going to walk in there and grab a grandmother
###989 out and then kick them out. We're not going -- and I think you have to be realistic in
###993 your indignation. I want to control the border. I want English to be the official language
###998 of government. I want us to have a lot of changes.
###1002 >> [APPLAUSE]
###1003 >> GINGRICH: I am prepared to be very tough and very bold, but I'm also prepared to be
###1008 realistic, because I've actually had to pass legislation in Washington and I don't believe
###1012 an unrealistic promise is going to get through, but I do believe, if there's some level of
###1018 humanity for people who have been here a long time, we can pass legislation that will decisively
###1023 reduce illegality, decisively control the border and will once again mean the people
###1028 who are in America are here legally.
###1030 >> BLITZER: I just want to make sure I understand. Is he still the most anti-immigrant candidate?
###1034 >> GINGRICH: I think, of the four of us, yes.
###1036 >> BLITZER: Go ahead, Governor.
###1038 >> ROMNEY: That's simply unexcusable. That's inexcusable. And, actually, Senator Marco
###1041 Rubio came to my defense and said that ad was inexcusable and inflammatory and inappropriate.
###1046 Mr. Speaker, I'm not anti-immigrant. My father was born in Mexico. My wife's father was born
###1051 in Wales. They came to this country. The idea that I'm anti-immigrant is repulsive. Don't
###1056 use a term like that. You can say we disagree on certain policies, but to say that enforcing
###1060 the U.S. law to protect our borders, to welcome people here legally, to expand legal immigration,
###1067 as I have proved, that that's somehow anti anti-immigrant is simply the kind of over-the-top
###1073 rhetoric that has characterized American politics too long. And I'm glad that Marco Rubio called
###1078 you out on it. I'm glad you withdrew it. I think you should apologize for it, and I think
###1082 you should recognize that having differences of opinions on issues does not justify labeling
###1087 people with highly charged epithets.
###1096 >> GINGRICH: I'll tell you what...
###1104 >> [APPLAUSE]
###1104 >> GINGRICH: I'll give you an opportunity to self-describe. You tell me what language
###1108 you would use to describe somebody who thinks that deporting a grandmother or a grandfather
###1113 from their family -- just tell me the language. I'm perfectly happy for you to explain what
###1117 language you'd use.
###1118 >> ROMNEY: Mr. Speaker, I think I described following the law as it exists in this country,
###1122 which is to say, I'm not going around and rounding people up and deporting them. What
###1126 I said was, people who come here legally get a work permit. People who do not come here
###1130 legally do not get a work permit. Those who don't get work will tend, over time, to self-deport.
###1135 I'm not going to go find grandmothers and take them out of their homes and deport them.
###1139 Those are your words, not my words. And to use that rhetoric suggests to people that
###1144 somehow, if you're not willing to keep people here who violated the law, that you're anti-
###1147 immigrant. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am pro-immigrant. I want people to
###1153 come to America with skill and vitality and vibrance. I want them to come legally. There
###1158 are grandmothers that live on the other side of the border that are waiting to come here
###1161 legally. I want them to come here, too, not just those that are already here.
###1167 >> [APPLAUSE]
###1168 >> GINGRICH: Well, so we have gone -- we've gone from your Washington attack when I first
###1177 proposed this and you said it was outrageous; it would be a magnet to you're accepting the
###1182 fact that, you know, a family is going to take care of their grandmother or their grandfather.
###1186 The idea that you are going to push them out in some form by simply saying they can't go
###1190 get a job -- I think the grandmother is still going to be here. All I want to do is to allow
###1194 the grandmother to be here legally with some rights to have residency but not citizenship,
###1201 so that he or she can finish their life with dignity within the law.
###1205 >> [APPLAUSE]
###1206 >> ROMNEY: You know, our problem is not 11 million grandmothers. Our problem is -- all
###1216 right.
###1219 >> [APPLAUSE]
###1221 >> ROMNEY: Our problem is 11 million people getting jobs that many Americans, legal immigrants,
###1226 would like to have. It's school kids in schools that districts are having a hard time paying
###1231 for. It's people getting free health care because we are required under the law to provide
###1234 that health care. And the real concern is the people who want to come here legally.
###1239 Let's let legal immigrants come here. Let's stop illegal immigration.
###1242 >> [APPLAUSE]
###1242 >> BLITZER: The rhetoric on immigration, Governor, has been intense, as you well know, as all
###1247 four of you know, and anyone who watches television knows. You had an ad running saying that Speaker
###1252 Gingrich called Spanish "the language of the ghetto." What do you mean by that?
###1257 >> ROMNEY: I haven't seen the ad, so I'm sorry. I don't get to see all the TV ads. Did he
###1261 say that?
###1262 >> BLITZER: Did you say that?
###1263 >> GINGRICH: No. What I said was, we want everybody to learn English because we don't
###1267 -- and I didn't use the word "Spanish." We do not want anyone trapped in a situation
###1272 where they cannot get a commercial job, they cannot rise, and virtually every parent of
###1277 every ethnic group -- and by the way, they are 94 languages spoken at the Miami-Dade
###1282 College -- 94 languages. And that's why I think English should be the official language
###1286 of government, and that's why I think every young American should learn English. And my
###1290 point was, no one should be trapped in a linguistics situation where they can't go out and get
###1295 a job and they can't go out and work. So I would say as much as Governor Romney doesn't
###1299 particularly like my use of language, I found his use of language and his deliberate distortion
###1303 equally offensive.
###1305 >> [APPLAUSE]
###1307 >> ROMNEY: I'd like -- I doubt that's my ad, but we'll take a look and find out. There
###1314 are a bunch of ads out there that are being organized by other people. But I think our
###1317 position on English in our schools and in our nation is the same, which I believe English
###1322 should be the official language of the United States, as it is. I also believe that in our
###1326 schools, we should teach kids in English. So, when I was governor, I fought for -- actually,
###1331 before I was governor, I fought for, during my election and thereafter, a program to have
###1335 English immersion in our schools so our kids could learn in English. I think we agree on
###1340 this, which is, you know what? Kids in this country should learn English so they can have
###1343 all the jobs and all the opportunity of people who are here.
###1346 >> BLITZER: I want to bring Congressman Paul and Senator Santorum into this. But let's
###1348 take this question from Miami. CNN en Espanol's Juan Carlos Lopez has a guest there.
###1355 >> LOPEZ: Hola, Wolf. We're at the viewing party for the Hispanic Leadership Network,
###1362 and it really is a party. They are holding their yearly conference, a meeting of Hispanic
###1366 Republican leaders. And I'm joined by Raquel Rodriguez. She's an attorney in Miami. She
###1370 practices business and international law, and she has a question for the candidates.
###1374 >> RODRIGUEZ: Yes, good evening. The U.S. has been largely away in its foreign and trade
###1381 policy with Latin America. In the meantime, Iran and China have been increasing their
###1386 influence over an involvement in Latin America through the leftist and left-leaning governments.
###1393 What would each of you do as president to more deeply engage in Latin America and, importantly,
###1399 to support the governments and the political parties that support democracy and free markets?
###1405 >> BLITZER: Congressman Paul?
###1406 >> PAUL: Well, I think free trade is the answer. Free trade is an answer to a lot of conflicts
###1411 around the world, so I'm always promoting free trade. And you might add Cuba, too. I
###1415 think we would be a lot better off with Cuba, trading with Cuba.
###1419 >> [APPLAUSE]
###1420 >> PAUL: So, I think the more you can do to promote this free trade, the better off we'll
###1425 be. But as far as us having an obligation, a military or a financial obligation to go
###1432 down and dictate to them what government they should have, I don't like that idea. I would
###1438 work with the people and encourage free trade, and try to set a standard here where countries
###1445 in Central America or South America or any place in the world would want to emulate us
###1449 and set the standards that we have. Unfortunately, sometimes we slip up on our standards and
###1455 we go around the world and we try to force ourselves on others. I don't think the nations
###1460 in South America and Central America necessarily want us to come down there and dictate which
###1464 government they should have. And yet, I believe with friendship and trade, you can have a
###1470 lot of influence, and I strongly believe that it's time we have friendship and trade with
###1476 Cuba.
###1476 >> [APPLAUSE]
###1477 >> BLITZER: Senator Santorum, are you with Congressman Paul?
###1481 >> SANTORUM: No, I'm not with Congressman Paul and I'm not with Barack Obama on this
###1484 issue. Our policy in Central and South America under this administration has been abysmal.
###1489 The way we have treated, in particular, countries like Honduras, Honduras, which stood up for
###1494 the rule of law, which threw out a would-be dictator who was using the Chavez playbook
###1499 from Venezuela in order to try to run for re-election in Honduras, and the United States
###1504 government, instead of standing behind the -- the people in the parliament, the people
###1508 in the Supreme Court, who tried to enforce the constitution of Honduras -- instead of
###1513 siding with them, the Democrats, President Obama sided with two other people in South
###1518 America -- excuse me -- Central America and South America. Chavez and Castro and Obama
###1524 sided against the people of Honduras. This is a consistent policy of siding with the
###1530 leftists, siding with the Marxists, siding with those who don't support democracy, not
###1535 standing up for our friends in Colombia, not standing up for our friends who want to engage
###1539 and support America, who want to be great trading partners and great allies for our
###1545 country, to be able to form that kind of bond that is so essential in our own hemisphere.
###1550 The European Union understood how important it was for diverse people to be able to come
###1556 together in an economic unit. We only -- not only have to come together as an economic
###1560 unit, but the threat of terrorism, the threat of Iran now in Venezuela and in other places,
###1566 and Cuba and in Nicaragua, the threat of radical Islam growing in that region -- is it important
###1573 for -- it's absolutely important for us to have a president who understands that threat
###1577 and understands the solution is closer ties. I will visit that area of the world, repeatedly,
###1582 to solidify those ties when I become president.
###1584 >> BLITZER: Let me let Congressman Paul...
###1585 >> [APPLAUSE]
###1586 >> BLITZER: quickly respond.
###1587 >> [APPLAUSE]
###1588 >> PAUL: The -- the senator mentioned standing up for some of these nations, but he doesn't
###1594 define it, but standing up for nations like this usually means that we impose ourselves,
###1599 go and pick the dictators, undermine certain governments, also sending them a lot of money.
###1604 It doesn't work. Most of the time, this backfires. They resent us. We can achieve what he wants
###1610 in a much different way than us using the bully attitude that you will do it our way.
###1617 This is the...
###1618 >> [APPLAUSE]
###1618 >> PAUL: This is not a benefit to us. And besides, where do you get the troops and where
###1622 are you going to get the money? Because you're talking about force. And I -- I know of a
###1627 much better way than using force to get along with people.
###1630 >> SANTORUM: I don't know where...
###1630 >> [APPLAUSE]
###1631 >> SANTORUM: I don't know what answer Congressman Paul was listening to. He obviously wasn't
###1637 listening to my answer.
###1640 >> [APPLAUSE]
###1641 >> SANTORUM: What I talked about is building strong economic relationships, strong national
###1649 security relationships. No one's talking about force. Nobody's talking about going into Cuba
###1653 or going into Venezuela. It's talking about the other countries in the region, which are
###1657 being influenced greatly by those countries, that are tending and moving toward those militant
###1663 socialists, instead of the United States. Why? Because we've ignored them. You've got
###1667 a president of the United States that held a Colombian free trade agreement -- Colombia,
###1671 who's out there on the front lines, working with us against the narco- terrorists, standing
###1674 up to Chavez in South America. And what did we do? For political -- domestic political
###1680 purposes, the president of the United States sided with organized labor and the environmental
###1684 groups and held Colombia hanging out to dry for three years. We cannot do that to our
###1689 friends in South America.
###1690 >> [APPLAUSE]
###1690 >> BLITZER: All right, we're going to -- we're going to come back to this.
###1693 >> [APPLAUSE]
###1693 >> BLITZER: We're going to come back to Cuba, as well. But stand by for that. We did double-check,
###1697 just now, Governor, that ad that we talked about, where I quoted you as saying that Speaker
###1702 Gingrich called Spanish "the language of the ghetto" -- we just double-checked. It was
###1706 one of your ads. It's running here in Florida in -- on the radio. And at the end you say,
###1711 "I'm Mitt Romney and I approved this ad." So it is -- it is here.
###1716 >> [BOOING]
###1717 >> ROMNEY: Let me ask -- let me ask a question. Let me ask the speaker a question. Did you
###1720 say what the ad says or not? I don't know.
###1723 >> GINGRICH: It's taken totally out of context.
###1724 >> ROMNEY: Oh, OK, he said it.
###1725 >> GINGRICH: I did not -- no. I did not say it about Spanish. I said, in general, about
###1729 all languages. We are better for children to learn English in general, period.
###1734 >> [APPLAUSE]
###1735 >> ROMNEY: Let's take a look at what he said. [APPLAUSE]
###1737 >> BLITZER: All right. We have a very important subject, housing. Not only here in Florida,
###1742 foreclosures really, really bad, but all over the country. And a lot of people are wondering
###1747 if the federal government contributed to the housing collapse in recent years. We got a
###1752 question that came in to us and -- let me put it up there and I'll read it to you. "How
###1758 would you phase out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? Does the private mortgage industry need
###1763 additional regulation?" -- that from William Schmidt. Let me start with Governor Romney.
###1768 >> ROMNEY: Well, I think you know that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were a big part of why
###1772 we have the housing crisis in the nation that we have. And we've had this discussion before.
###1777 Speaker Gingrich was hired by Freddie Mac to promote them, to -- to influence other
###1783 people throughout Washington, encouraging them to -- not to dismantle these two entities.
###1787 I think that was an enormous mistake. I think, instead, we should have had a whistle-blower
###1792 and not horn-tooter. He should have stood up and said, look, these things are a disaster;
###1796 this is a crisis. He should have been anxiously telling the American people that these entities
###1801 were causing a housing bubble that would cause a collapse that we've seen here in Florida
###1805 and around the country. And are they a problem today? Absolutely. They're offering mortgages,
###1810 again to people who can't possibly repay them. We're creating another housing bubble, which
###1814 will hurt the American people. The right course for our -- for our housing industry is to
###1818 get people back to work so they can buy homes again. We have 9.9 percent unemployment in
###1824 Florida. It's unthinkable, 18 percent real unemployment here. Get people back to work.
###1829 We'll get people into homes. Get the foreclosures out of the system. Let people get into homes,
###1834 rent properties if necessary and get America's housing industry growing again.
###1838 >> BLITZER: Speaker Gingrich?
###1839 >> GINGRICH: Let me start by saying, Florida is one of the two or three most hard hit states
###1846 on foreclosures. How many of you know somebody who has had a house foreclosed? Just raise
###1851 your hand. Raise your hand.
###1853 >> [APPLAUSE]
###1853 >> GINGRICH: Okay. The governor has cheerfully -- the governor has cheerfully attacking me
###1859 inaccurately and he knows it. The contracts we released from Freddie Mac said I would
###1863 do no consulting, wrote in, no -- I mean no lobbying, none. But this is a more interesting
###1868 story. We began digging in after Monday night because frankly I'd had about enough of this.
###1872 We discovered to our shock, Governor Romney owns shares of both Fannie Mae and Freddie
###1877 Mac. Governor Romney made a million dollars off of selling some of that. Governor Romney
###1882 owns share -- has an investment in Goldman Sachs, which is today foreclosing on Floridians.
###1888 So maybe Governor Romney in the spirit of openness should tell us how much money he's
###1891 made off of how many households that have been foreclosed by his investments? And let's
###1898 be clear about that.
###1902 >> [APPLAUSE]
###1903 >> ROMNEY: First of all, my investments are not made by me. My investments for the last
###1909 10 years have been in a blind trust, managed by a trustee. Secondly, the investments that
###1914 they've made, we've learned about this as we made our financial disclosure, have been
###1917 in mutual funds and bonds. I don't own stock in either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. There
###1922 are bonds that the investor has held through mutual funds. And Mr. Speaker, I know that
###1928 sounds like an enormous revelation, but have you checked your own investments? You also
###1933 have investments through mutual funds that also invest in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
###1937 >> [APPLAUSE]
###1938 >> ROMNEY: Let me -- let me -- I've got more time. Let me -- let me -- let me just -- let
###1949 me just continue. There's a big difference between buying like U.S. savings bonds and
###1954 getting a return. That's a -- that's not taking money out of the United States, that's loaning
###1959 money to the United States. And what my trustee did, is he loaned money to Fannie Mae and
###1963 Freddie Mac and -- and they got paid interest of course, just like if you buy U.S. savings
###1967 bonds. But what the speaker did, was to work as a spokesman to promote Fannie Mae and Freddie
###1973 Mac. To protect them from those people that wanted to take them down. He got paid $1.6
###1978 million to do that. He said his first contract indicated there would be no lobbying. But
###1982 his second contract didn't have that prescription taken out of it. And so you have to ask yourself
###1987 why is that? What he was doing was clearly promoting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in this
###1991 case Freddie Mac to the tune of $1.6 million. That is one of the reasons we're in the trouble
###1997 we're in.
###1997 >> BLITZER: Go ahead.
###1998 >> GINGRICH: Well, first of all, you'll notice that the governor wasn't aware of the ad he
###2001 was running. He's not aware of the investments that were being made in his name.
###2004 >> ROMNEY: Of course, I can't it's a blind trust.
###2006 >> [CROSSTALK]
###2007 >> GINGRICH: ...compare my investments with his is like comparing a tiny mouse with a
###2010 giant elephant. The fact -- the fact is...
###2013 [APPLAUSE]
###2014 >> GINGRICH: ...that there is a very substantial question. You didn't give any instructions
###2019 to -- to say, gee, let's not do this or let's not do that? You're very quick to draw the
###2025 widest possible exaggeration. The fact is, the only time I ever spoke to the Congress
###2031 about this issue was in July of 2008. The New York Times reported it. I told the Republicans
###2036 in the House, vote no. Do not give them any money. They need to be reformed. And in answer
###2042 to the question earlier, I would break each of them up into five or six separate units.
###2046 And over a five year period, I would wean them from all federal sponsorship because
###2050 we need to get away from this gigantic systems.
###2052 >> BLITZER: Let me bring Congressman Paul, then Senator Santorum.
###2054 >> [APPLAUSE]
###2054 >> BLITZER: A follow up question to you both specifically. It seems they both acknowledge
###2059 they both made money from Fannie and Freddie. Should they return that money?
###2063 >> PAUL: That -- that subject really doesn't interest me a whole lot.
###2067 >> [APPLAUSE]
###2068 >> PAUL: But the question does. The -- the question is, what are we going to do about
###2076 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It should have been auctioned off right after the crash came.
###2081 It would have been cleansed by now.
###2083 >> [APPLAUSE]
###2084 >> PAUL: It should have been sold.
###2086 >> [APPLAUSE]
###2086 >> PAUL: But maybe it's my physician background, but I think an ounce of prevention is what
###2091 we ought to talk about so we can quit doing this. But we know how the bubble came about.
###2095 It was excessive credit, interest rates held too low, too long, the Federal Reserve responsible
###2100 for that. Community Reinvestment Act, which is Affirmative Action telling banks they have
###2104 to make these risky loans. And at the same time, there was a line of credit which allowed
###2110 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to, you know, make more money. And it was -- it was assumed that
###2117 they would always be protected. Now, you can't argue. I've talked a long time about cutting
###2123 off that credit from the Fed. I was trying to prevent this stuff.
###2126 >> [APPLAUSE]
###2126 >> PAUL: Also, I opposed the Community Reinvestment Act, as well as I had legislation in 10 years
###2132 before the bust came to remove that line of credit to the Treasury.
###2137 >> BLITZER: Senator Santorum?
###2139 >> SANTORUM: Well, I would just say, in answer to the question, that as I mentioned last
###2143 debate, in 2006, I went out and authored a letter with 24 other senators asking for major
###2149 reform of Freddie and Fannie, warning of a meltdown and a bubble in the housing market.
###2153 I stood out, I stood tall, and tried to get a reform, and we couldn't do it. The reform
###2157 we'd need is to gradually decrease the amount of mortgage that can be financed by Freddie
###2163 -- or underwritten by Freddie and Fannie over time, keep reducing that until we get rid
###2168 of Fannie and Freddie. The bigger issue here is, these two gentlemen, who are out distracting
###2174 from the most important issues we have been playing petty personal politics, can we set
###2178 aside that Newt was a member of Congress and used the skills that he developed as a member
###2184 of Congress to go out and advise companies -- and that's not the worst thing in the world
###2188 -- and that Mitt Romney is a wealthy guy because worked hard and he's going out and working
###2191 hard? And you guys should that alone and focus on the issues.
###2197 >> [APPLAUSE]
###2198 >> BLITZER: We're going to take a quick break, but we have a lot more to discuss. Coming
###2209 up, the debate questions go to space, the final frontier. Stay with us.
###2225 >> [COMMERCIAL BREAK]
###2228 >> BLITZER: We're continuing the debate here in Jacksonville, Florida. Let's get to the
###2237 issue of transparency, because voters out there, they want to know as much about you
###2241 four gentlemen as possible before they vote. Tax returns -- let me bring this to Speaker
###2246 Gingrich. Earlier this week, you said Governor Romney, after he released his taxes, you said
###2252 that you were satisfied with the level of transparency of his personal finances when
###2257 it comes to this. And I just want to reiterate and ask you, are you satisfied right now with
###2262 the level of transparency as far as his personal finances?
###2265 >> GINGRICH: Wolf, you and I have a great relationship, it goes back a long way. I'm
###2270 with him. This is a nonsense question.
###2274 >> [APPLAUSE]
###2275 >> GINGRICH: Look, how about if the four of us agree for the rest of the evening, we'll
###2284 actually talk about issues that relate to governing America?
###2286 >> BLITZER: But, Mr. Speaker, you made an issue of this, this week, when you said that,
###2290 "He lives in a world of Swiss bank and Cayman Island bank accounts." I didn't say that.
###2295 You did.
###2295 >> GINGRICH: I did. And I'm perfectly happy to say that on an interview on some TV show.
###2298 But this is a national debate, where you have a chance to get the four of us to talk about
###2302 a whole range of issues.
###2302 >> BLITZER: But if you make a serious accusation against Governor Romney like that, you need
###2307 to explain that.
###2307 >> GINGRICH: I simply suggested --
###2308 >> [BOOING]
###2309 >> GINGRICH: You want to try again? I mean --
###2311 >> ROMNEY: Wouldn't it be nice if people didn't make accusations somewhere else that they
###2316 weren't willing to defend here?
###2318 >> [APPLAUSE]
###2319 >> GINGRICH: OK. All right. Given that standard, Mitt, I did say I thought it was unusual.
###2326 And I don't know of any American president who has had a Swiss bank account. I'd be glad
###2330 for you to explain that sort of thing.
###2332 >> ROMNEY: OK. I will. I will. I'll say it again. I have a trustee that manages my investments
###2338 in a blind trust. That was so that I would avoid any conflicts of interest. That trustee
###2343 indicated last week, when he was asked about this, he said that he wanted to diversify
###2347 the investments that I had. And for awhile he had money in a Swiss account, reported
###2351 in the U.S., full taxes paid on it, U.S. taxes. There's nothing wrong with that. And I know
###2356 that there may be some who try to make a deal of that, as you have publicly. But look, I
###2360 think it's important for people to make sure that we don't castigate individuals who have
###2364 been successful and try and, by innuendo, suggest there's something wrong with being
###2368 successful and having investments and having a return on those investments. Speaker, you've
###2372 indicated that somehow I don't earn that money. I have earned the money that I have. I didn't
###2377 inherit it. I take risks. I make investments. Those investments lead to jobs being created
###2382 in America. I'm proud of being successful. I'm proud of being in the free enterprise
###2386 system that creates jobs for other people. I'm not going to run from that. I'm proud
###2390 of the taxes I pay. My taxes, plus my charitable contributions, this year, 2011, will be about
###2396 40 percent. So, look, let's put behind this idea of attacking me because of my investments
###2400 or my money, and let's get Republicans to say, you know what? What you've accomplished
###2404 in your life shouldn't be seen as a detriment, it should be seen as an asset to help America.
###2409 >> [APPLAUSE]
###2409 >> BLITZER: Mr. Speaker, I'm ready to move on, if you are.
###2417 >> GINGRICH: What?
###2418 >> BLITZER: I said I'm ready to move on to the next subject if you are.
###2422 >> GINGRICH: I'm happy to. I'm happy to simply say, you know, it would be nice if you had
###2426 the same standard for other people that you would like applied to you and didn't enter
###2430 into personal attacks about personal activities about which you are factually wrong. So I
###2434 would be glad to have a truce with you, but it's a two-way truce.
###2438 >> [BOOING]
###2439 >> [APPLAUSE]
###2439 >> ROMNEY: I'm happy on any occasion to describe the things that I believe with regards to
###2443 the Speaker's background. We'll probably get a chance to do that as time goes on.
###2446 >> BLITZER: Mr. Speaker, explain why you think the money that he made over these many years,
###2452 recent years, under your tax -- hold on. Mr. Speaker, under your tax plan -- we're talking
###2458 about taxes right now. This is substance. Under your proposed tax plan, he would pay
###2463 zero taxes. Explain that.
###2465 >> GINGRICH: Well, it would depend on whether the particular kind of payments he made were
###2469 counted under that plan as capital gains or whether they were counted as regular income.
###2473 But even as regular income, he would pay about the same. And I've said this. This is where
###2477 I'm the opposite of Obama. I believe we need to have somebody who fights for hardworking
###2481 taxpayers. My interest is in reducing everybody's tax here to 15 percent, not trying to raise
###2486 his to the Obama level. So I proposed an alternative flat tax --
###2490 >> [APPLAUSE]
###2491 >> GINGRICH: You know, I have proposed an alternative flat tax that people could fill
###2495 out where you could either keep the current system -- this is what they do in Hong Kong
###2498 -- keep the current system with all of its deductions and all its paperwork, or you'd
###2502 have a single page -- I earned this amount, I have this number of dependents, here is
###2506 15 percent. My goal is to shrink the government to fit the revenue, not to raise the revenue
###2512 to catch up with the government. And I'd be happy...
###2513 >> [APPLAUSE]
###2513 >> Let me just say, I'd -- I would be happy to have the Mitt Romney flat tax for every
###2522 American to pay at that rate, and I haven't complained about the rate he pays.
###2526 >> BLITZER: Senator Santorum, most of the polls, almost all of the polls, want the wealthiest
###2531 Americans to pay more in taxes in order to balance the budget. Why are they wrong, in
###2537 your opinion?
###2537 >> SANTORUM: Because we need to have as much money funneling through this economy as possible.
###2543 And the people who make those investments are people who have resources and wealth,
###2546 and we want them to deploy that wealth in the most productive way possible. And when
###2550 you increase tax rates and you make things much more expensive to do -- in other words,
###2554 the rate of return is not as profitable, then they tend to do things like investing in -- in
###2559 nontaxable instruments and other things that don't employ people. And so what I believe
###2563 is we need to reduce taxes. I don't -- look, I'm honest. I don't reduce the higher -- top
###2567 rate as much as these other folks do. I take the Reagan approach. Ronald Reagan had a 28
###2572 percent top rate. If it was good enough for Ronald Reagan, it's good enough for me. And
###2575 that's what we put the top rate as.
###2577 >> [APPLAUSE]
###2577 >> SANTORUM: And -- and we have a bottom rate of 10 percent. I believe in a differential.
###2581 I don't believe in a flat tax. I believe in a simplified tax code with five deductions
###2586 and -- and focus on simplify, creating two rates. I disagree with Newt also on this.
###2592 I don't believe in a zero capital gains tax rate. I don't think you need to get to zero
###2596 to make sure that there's an efficient deployment of capital and investment. I think, if you
###2601 get to zero, then, in fact, guys like Mitt Romney, who, again, I give him -- I wish I
###2606 made as much money as Mitt Romney, but...
###2608 >> [APPLAUSE]
###2608 >> SANTORUM: But -- you know, but he wouldn't probably pay much at all in taxes. And I think
###2613 that, as long as the tax is not one that deters a proper investment to be able to deploy capital
###2621 and to get jobs created, then lower rates are better than zero when it comes to the
###2626 issue of capital gains.
###2627 >> BLITZER: Are you with Ronald Reagan as far as the tax rates, as Senator Santorum
###2631 has suggested, Congressman Paul?
###2632 >> PAUL: No, he taxed too much. My goal is to get rid of the 16th amendment. And the
###2637 only way you can do that...
###2638 >> [APPLAUSE]
###2639 >> PAUL: The only way you can do that is not run a welfare system and a warfare system
###2644 in policing the world. But I do want to address this subject about taxing the rich. That is
###2651 not a solution. But I understand and really empathize with the people who talk about the
###2656 99 percent and the 1 percent. Because there's a characteristic about what happens when you
###2660 destroy a currency. There is a transfer of wealth from the middle class to the wealthy.
###2664 And this has been going on for 40 years. So the middle class is shrinking. They are getting
###2668 poorer and they're losing their jobs and they're losing their houses. But Wall Street isn't
###2672 getting poorer. And they are the ones who are getting the bailout. So we have to address
###2677 the bailout and the system that favors a certain group over another group. If you don't have
###2682 sound money and if you have a welfare state, no matter whether the welfare state is designed
###2685 to help the poor, you know, the welfare system helps the wealthy. And there has been this
###2690 transfer of wealth. So, if we could stop all of these transfers to the wealthy class, but
###2697 the solution isn't to tax the wealthy. If you give an honest product and customers buy
###2704 that product, you deserve to keep that money and earn that money. But there's a big difference
###2709 between those who earn money and those who rip us off through the government and the
###2714 monetary system.
###2715 >> [APPLAUSE]
###2716 >> BLITZER: Congressman Paul, you're a physician. You're 76 years old. You would be the oldest
###2725 president of the United States if you were elected. Are you prepared to release your
###2730 medical records so voters out there know what your health is?
###2734 >> [LAUGHTER]
###2734 >> PAUL: Oh, obviously, because it's about one page, if even that long. But...
###2739 >> [LAUGHTER]
###2740 >> PAUL: But I'm willing to...
###2742 >> [APPLAUSE]
###2742 >> PAUL: I'm willing to challenge any of these gentlemen up here to a 25- mile bike ride
###2747 any time of the day in the heat of Texas.
###2753 >> [APPLAUSE]
###2753 >> PAUL: And, you know -- you know, that subject has come up and sometimes in fun but sometimes
###2759 not in fun. But, you know, there are laws against age discrimination, so if you push
###2763 this too much, you better be careful.
###2767 >> [APPLAUSE]
###2768 >> BLITZER: I raise the question because you remember, four years ago, the same question
###2772 came up with John McCain and he released his records, finally. I remember our own Dr. Sanjay
###2776 Gupta spent hours reviewing those records. So let me go down and ask all of you. Are
###2781 you ready to release your medical records?
###2782 >> ROMNEY: Happy to do so.
###2784 >> GINGRICH: I'm happy to. And I also want to attest I'm confident that Dr. Paul is quite
###2788 ready to serve if he's elected. Watching him campaign, he's in great shape.
###2794 >> [LAUGHTER]
###2795 >> [APPLAUSE]
###2796 >> BLITZER: All right, we have another question from the audience. I'll look forward to seeing
###2800 your medical records.
###2802 >> [LAUGHTER]
###2802 >> BLITZER: Go ahead. Let's take a question right now. Please introduce yourself, as well.
###2807 >> QUESTION: Good evening. My name is Matthew Bathel. My question is, what would your plan
###2811 be for the future of manned space flight and the future of NASA?
###2815 >> BLITZER: All right, let me go to Governor Romney on this one. An important issue, especially
###2819 here in Florida where a lot of people have lost their jobs as a result of the decline
###2824 of the space program. Yesterday Speaker Gingrich outlined a -- a pretty long plan on what to
###2830 do about it and he said that by the end of his second term, if he were elected president,
###2834 there would be a permanent base on the moon. Good idea?
###2838 >> ROMNEY: That's an enormous expense. And right now I want to be spending money here.
###2843 Of course the space coast has been badly hurt and I believe in a very vibrant and strong
###2848 space program. To define the mission for our space program, I'd like to bring in the -- the
###2852 top professors that relate to space areas and physics, the top people from industry.
###2856 Because I want to make sure what we're doing in space translates into commercial products.
###2860 I want to bring in our top military experts on space needs. And -- and finally of course,
###2864 the -- the people from -- the administration if I had an administration. I'd like to come
###2868 together and talk about different options and the cost. I'd like corporate America as
###2872 well as the defense network and others that could come together in a -- in a part -- in,
###2877 if you will, a partnership basis to create a plan that will keep our space program thriving
###2882 and growing. I -- I believe in a manned space program. I'd like to see whether they believe
###2886 in the same thing. I'm not -- I'm not looking for a -- a colony on the moon. I think the
###2890 cost of that would be in the hundreds of billions, if not trillions. I'd rather be rebuilding
###2895 housing here in the U.S.
###2896 >> BLITZER: We have a question. I want to speaker to weigh in as well.
###2900 >> [APPLAUSE]
###2900 >> BLITZER: This question is related from -- we got it from Twitter. Speaker Gingrich,
###2904 how do you plan to create a base on the moon while keeping taxes down in eight years?
###2909 >> [LAUGHTER]
###2909 >> GINGRICH: I think, look it's a great question. You start with the question, do you really
###2912 believe NASA in it's current form is the most effective way of leveraging investment in
###2917 space? We now have a bureaucracy sitting there, which has managed to mismanage the program
###2921 so well that in fact we have no lift vehicle. So you almost have to wonder, what does the
###2925 Washington office of NASA do? Does it sit around and think space?
###2930 >> [LAUGHTER]
###2930 >> GINGRICH: Does it contemplate that some day we could have a rocket? My point in the
###2934 speech I made yesterday, which is on CSPAN and I'd love to have all of you look at it.
###2938 It's based on having looked at space issues since the late 1950's when missiles and rockets
###2943 was a separate magazine. And working with NASA and others. I believe by the use of prizes,
###2948 by the use of incentives, by opening up the space port so that it's available on a ready
###2953 basis for commercial fight, by using commonsense for example the Atlas-V could easily be fixed
###2959 into a man capable vehicle so you didn't have to rely on -- on a Russian launch or a Chinese
###2965 launch. There are many things you can do to leverage accelerating the development of space.
###2970 Lindbergh flew to Paris for a $25,000.00 prize. If we had a handful of serious prizes, you'd
###2976 see an extraordinary number of people out there trying to get to the moon first in order
###2980 to have billed [ph] that. And I'd like to have an American on the moon before the Chinese
###2985 get there.
###2985 >> BLITZER: Senator Santorum?
###2987 >> [APPLAUSE]
###2989 >> SANTORUM: I -- I believe America's a frontier nation and obviously the frontier that -- that
###2994 we're talking about is -- is the next one, which is space. And that we need to inspire.
###2999 One of the big problems we have in our country today is that young people are not getting
###3002 involved in math and science and not dreaming big dreams. So NASA or the space program where
###3008 space is important, NASA is one component that -- our -- our space defense is another
###3015 area. I think both of -- both of which are very, very important. I agree that we need
###3019 to bring good minds in the private sector much more involved in NASA than the government
###3024 bureaucracy that we have. But let's just be honest, we run a $1.2 trillion deficit right
###3029 now. We're -- we're borrowing 40-cents of every dollar. And to go out there and promise
###3034 new programs and big ideas, that's a great thing to maybe get votes, but it's not a responsible
###3039 thing when you have to go out and say that we have to start cutting programs, not talking
###3043 about how to -- how to -- how to grow them. We're going to cut programs. We're going to
###3048 spend -- under my administration, we're going to spend less money every year -- every year.
###3052 Year, to year, to year the federal government amount of spending will go down for four years
###3056 until we get a balanced budget. And you can't do that by -- by -- by grand schemes. Whether
###3061 it's the space program or frankly whether it's the Speaker's Social Security program,
###3065 which will create a brand-new Social Security entitlement. Those are things that sound good
###3069 and maybe make big promises to people, but we've got to be responsible in the way we
###3074 allocate our resources.
###3075 >> BLITZER: We're going to get to that in a moment, but...
###3077 >> [APPLAUSE]
###3077 >> BLITZER: Congressman Paul, Texas, the space program very important there as well. Where
###3081 do you stand on this?
###3083 >> PAUL: Well, I don't think we should go to the moon. I think we maybe should send
###3087 some politicians up there.
###3089 >> [APPLAUSE]
###3091 >> PAUL: But I went -- I went into the Air Force in 1962 and studied aerospace medicine.
###3098 Actually had a daydream about maybe becoming the first physician to go into space. That
###3103 -- that didn't occur, but I see space -- the amount of money we spend on space, the only
###3108 part that I would vote for is for national defense purposes. Not to explore the moon
###3112 and go to Mars. I think that's fantastic. That's -- I love those ideas. But I also don't
###3117 like the idea of building government business partnerships. If we had a healthy economy
###3122 and had more Bill Gateses and more Warren Buffetts, the money would be there. It should
###3128 be privatized, and the people who work in the industry, if you had that, there would
###3132 be jobs in aerospace. And I just think that we don't need a bigger, a newer program, when
###3140 you think of the people -- I mean, health care or something else deserves a lot more
###3146 priority than going to the moon. So, I would be very reluctant, but space technology should
###3153 be followed up to some degree for national defense purposes, but not just for the fun
###3158 of it and, you know, for -- you know, for scientific --
###3161 >> BLITZER: We're going to leave this subject, but before we do, I want Speaker Gingrich
###3164 to clarify what you said yesterday in that major speech you delivered on space. You said
###3168 that you would support a lunar colony or a lunar base, and that if 13,000 Americans were
###3174 living there, they would be able to apply for U.S. statehood from the moon.
###3179 >> GINGRICH: I was meeting Rick's desire for grandiose ideas. But --
###3183 >> BLITZER: That's a pretty grandiose idea.
###3185 >> GINGRICH: But let me make just two points about this. It is really important to go back
###3190 and look at what John F. Kennedy said in May of 1961 when he said, "We will go to the moon
###3197 in this decade." No American had orbited the Earth. The technology didn't exist. And a
###3203 generation of young people went into science and engineering and technology, and they were
###3207 tremendously excited. And they had a future. I actually agree with Dr. Paul. The program
###3212 I envision would probably end up being 90 percent private sector, but it would be based
###3217 on a desire to change the government rules and change the government regulations, to
###3221 get NASA out of the business of trying to run rockets, and to create a system where
###3225 it's easy for private sector people to be engaged. I want to see us move from one launch
###3229 occasionally to six or seven launches a day because so many private enterprises walk up
###3234 and say, we're prepared to go do it. But I'll tell you, I do not want to be the country
###3238 that having gotten to the moon first, turned around and said, it doesn't really matter,
###3243 let the Chinese dominate space, what do we care? I think that is a path of national decline,
###3248 and I am for America being a great country, not a country in decline.
###3252 >> [APPLAUSE]
###3252 >> BLITZER: We're going to move on, but go ahead, Governor Romney.
###3257 >> ROMNEY: I spent 25 years in business. If I had a business executive come to me and
###3263 say they wanted to spend a few hundred billion dollars to put a colony on the moon, I'd say,
###3268 "You're fired." The idea that corporate America wants to go off to the moon and build a colony
###3273 there, it may be a big idea, but it's not a good idea. And we have seen in politics
###3278 -- we've seen politicians -- and Newt, you've been part of this -- go from state to state
###3282 and promise exactly what that state wants to hear. The Speaker comes here to Florida,
###3287 wants to spend untold amount of money having a colony on the moon. I know it's very exciting
###3291 on the Space Coast. In South Carolina, it was a new interstate highway, and dredging
###3295 the port in Charleston. In New Hampshire, it was burying a power line coming in from
###3299 Canada and building a new VHA hospital in New Hampshire so that people don't have to
###3304 go to Boston. Look, this idea of going state to state and promising what people want to
###3309 hear, promising billions, hundreds of billions of dollars to make people happy, that's what
###3314 got us into the trouble we're in now. We've got to say no to this kind of spending.
###3327 >> [APPLAUSE]
###3327 >> GINGRICH: I want to make two points. First, I thought we were a country where one of the
###3330 purposes of candidates going around was to actually learn about the states they campaigned
###3334 in and actually be responsive to the needs of the states they campaign in. For example,
###3338 the port of Jacksonville is going to have to be expanded because the Panama Canal is
###3342 being widened, and I think that's useful thing for a president to know. I think it's important
###3347 for presidents to know about local things. Second -- and at the other end of the state,
###3352 the Everglades Restoration Project has to be completed, and it's the federal government
###3356 which has failed. But, second, in response to what Rick said, when we balanced the budget
###3360 with the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, and ultimately had four consecutive balanced budgets, we
###3366 doubled the size of the National Institutes of Health because we set priorities. It is
###3371 possible to do the right things in the right order to make this a bigger, richer, more
###3376 exciting country. You don't just have to be cheap everywhere. You can actually have priorities
###3380 to get things done.
###3381 >> [APPLAUSE]
###3381 >> BLITZER: All right. We're going to move on. But go ahead, Ron Paul.
###3384 >> PAUL: I want to make a quick comment, because Newt's mentioned this quite a few times about
###3387 balancing the budget for four times. I went back and looked at the record. The budget
###3391 was -- the national debt during those four years actually went up about a trillion dollars.
###3395 What he's talking about is, he doesn't count the money he takes out of Social Security.
###3400 So, Reagan nor you had a truly balanced budget because the national debt goes up, and that's
###3406 what we pay the interest on. So I think you've stretched that a little bit more than you
###3410 should have.
###3411 >> [APPLAUSE]
###3411 >> BLITZER: Go ahead and respond. And then Senator Santorum.
###3414 >> GINGRICH: No, I...
###3415 >> BLITZER: You want to respond to Congressman Paul?
###3417 >> GINGRICH: No, I would just say -- I would just say, under the system that was used,
###3421 we were $405 billion [inaudible]...
###3423 >> [BOOING]
###3423 >> GINGRICH: I agree with Ron -- but let me finish. I actually agree with you, and I propose
###3428 that we take Social Security off budget so no president can ever again get threaten,
###3432 as Obama did in August, that he would not send the check out, and you could set Social
###3437 Security back up as a free-standing trust fund. It does have enough money and you could
###3441 in fact pay the checks without regard to politics in Washington.
###3444 >> BLITZER: Go ahead, quickly.
###3445 >> [APPLAUSE]
###3445 >> SANTORUM: Well, look, we just listened to the president of the United States the
###3448 other night completely ignore the biggest problem facing this country when it comes
###3452 to our financial health. We've been downgraded as a -- as a -- as a country and the president
###3457 of the United States completely ignored any of the heavy work, the hard work in being
###3462 honest with the American public about what we have to do to get our fiscal house in order.
###3468 And I think that's the point I would make here. Going around and promising a whole bunch
###3471 of new ideas and new projects and big ideas -- that was fine. And maybe we need it; we
###3476 can do that. I supported the doubling of the National Institutes of Health. But we didn't
###3480 have a $1.2 trillion deficit. We didn't -- we weren't at over -- we are now going to reach
###3486 $16 trillion, which is more than our whole GDP. We were not in that situation 20, 15
###3492 years ago. We are in a different world. We need leaders who are going to be honest with
###3497 the people of this country, of the problems we have, and have bold solutions to make that
###3501 happen. I'll do that.
###3502 >> BLITZER: Let's continue on this subject.
###3504 >> [APPLAUSE]
###3504 >> BLITZER: But let's take a question from the audience. Go ahead. Stand up and please
###3508 introduce yourself.
###3509 >> QUESTION: My name is Lynn Frazier and I live here in Jacksonville. And for the Republican
###3516 presidential candidates, my question is, I'm currently unemployed and I found myself unemployed
###3521 for the first time in 10 years and unable to afford health care benefits. What type
###3526 of hope can you promise me and others in my position?
###3530 >> [APPLAUSE]
###3530 >> BLITZER: Let's ask Congressman Paul.
###3533 >> PAUL: Well, it's a tragedy because this is a consequence of the government being involved
###3539 in medicine since 1965. When I was growing up, we didn't have a whole lot, but my dad
###3546 had a small insurance, but medical care costs weren't that much. And you should have an
###3552 opportunity -- medical care insurance should be given to you as an individual, so if you're
###3556 employed or not employed, you have -- you just take care of that and you keep it up.
###3561 When you lose a job, sometimes you lose your insurance. But the cost is so high. When you
###3566 pump money into something, like housing, cost -- prices go up. If you pump money into education,
###3572 the cost of education goes up. When the government gets involved in medicine, you don't get better
###3577 care; you get -- cost goes up and it distorts the economy and leads to a crisis. But your
###3582 medical care should go with you. You should get total deduction on it. It would be so
###3586 much less expensive. It doesn't solve every single problem, but you're -- you're suffering
###3592 from the consequence of way too much government and the cost going up because government has
###3596 inflated the cost and we have a government-created recession, and that is a consequence of the
###3603 business cycle.
###3603 >> BLITZER: Speaker -- Speaker Gingrich, what should Lynn do?
###3605 >> [APPLAUSE]
###3606 >> GINGRICH: Well, look, the first -- she actually put her finger on two different problems.
###3611 The largest challenge of this country is to get the economy growing so she can have a
###3615 job so it's easy for her to have insurance. We -- we need -- and the president did nothing
###3619 about this the other night. In fact, his proposal on taxes would make the economy worse. We
###3623 need to have a program which would start with, frankly, repealing Obamacare, repealing Dodd-Frank,
###3629 repealing Sarbanes-Oxley.
###3629 >> [APPLAUSE]
###3629 >> GINGRICH: And we need to give her a chance at a job. Second, we need real health reform,
###3635 not the Obama style, but we need health reform that allows her to buy in. And Dr. Paul is
###3640 right. She ought to get the same tax break whether she buys personally or whether she
###3643 buys through a economy. She should also be able to buy into an association so that she's
###3647 buying with lots of other people so it's not single insurance, which is the most expensive
###3652 kind. But you combine those two, reforming the insurance system and getting the economy
###3657 growing again so people are back at work, you cure an awful lot of America's problems
###3662 with those two steps, and you put her back in a position where she's in charge of her
###3666 life; she's not dependent on Barack Obama to take care of her.
###3669 >> [APPLAUSE]
###3670 >> BLITZER: That plan work for you, Governor? ROMNEY: Actually, what both these gentlemen
###3675 said is pretty much spot-on. And I'd -- and I'll add a couple of things. One, I want to
###3680 underscore something both of them said, and that is, right now in America, if you have
###3684 insurance, you most likely got it through your employer. And the reason is, your employer
###3689 gets a deduction for you when they buy the insurance for you. That means that, if you
###3692 change jobs, you've got to get a new insurance company, most likely. And if you become unemployed,
###3698 you lose your insurance. That doesn't make sense. And if an individual wants to own their
###3701 own insurance, they're not part of a big group, and so as a result they get a very high rate.
###3706 What we should do is allow individuals to own their own insurance and have the same
###3710 tax treatment as companies get. You do that and people like this young woman would be
###3714 able to own her insurance. The rates would be substantial lower for her buying it individually
###3719 than if she had to buy it individually today. Secondly, getting people to work. This president
###3724 has failed the American people. He got up there and gave a speech last night. It was
###3729 like Groundhog Day all over again. He said the same things and the same results we're
###3733 seeing today. People are not working.
###3737 >> [APPLAUSE]
###3740 >> ROMNEY: And we know what it takes to put people back to work. He said some of those
###3746 things last night -- lowering corporate taxes, lowering regulations, opening up all of the
###3751 above in energy, cracking down on China. He just doesn't do any of those things, and if
###3755 I'm president, I will do those things and I'll get you back to work. Thank you.
###3760 >> [APPLAUSE]
###3761 >> SANTORUM: All three of these folks sound great and I agree with them. I would just
###3766 add that health savings account, which I introduced 20 years ago with John Kasich, is really the
###3771 fundamental reform of getting consumers back involved in the health care system. The problem
###3775 with the answers from Congressman Gingrich and Governor Romney is that, well, they didn't
###3781 always say what they're saying. Governor Romney was the author of Romneycare, which is a top-
###3787 down government-run health care system which, read an article today, has 15 different items
###3793 directly in common with Obamacare, everything from the increase in the Medicaid program,
###3798 not just that government is going to mandate you buy something that's a condition of breathing,
###3804 mandate that you buy an insurance policy, something that Governor Romney agreed to at
###3809 the state level, something Congressman Gingrich for 20 years advocated, that the federal government
###3815 can force each and every person to enter into a private contract. Something that everyone
###3822 now, at least up on this stage, says is radically unconstitutional, Congressman Gingrich supported
###3827 for 20 years. Governor Romney supported it in the state, a state that is a -- pretty
###3833 much a model for what Obamacare is going to look like -- the highest health care costs
###3837 in the country, 27 percent above the average, average waiting time -- 94 percent of the
###3843 people in Massachusetts are now insured, but there was just a survey that came out and
###3847 said one in four don't get the care they need because of the high cost. So, you have a card,
###3854 you're covered, but you can't get care. This is the top-down model that both of these gentlemen
###3859 say they're now against, but they've been for, and it does not provide the contrast
###3864 we need with Barack Obama if we're going to take on that most important issue. We cannot
###3869 give the issue of health care away in this election. It is too foundational for us to
###3874 win this election.
###3875 >> BLITZER: A quick rebuttal from Speaker Gingrich and then Governor Romney.
###3878 >> [APPLAUSE]
###3878 >> GINGRICH: Well, in my case, I think Rick is lumping us together rather more than is
###3884 accurate. If you go to healthtransformation.net, I founded the Center for Health Transformation.
###3889 I wrote a book in 2002 called "Saving Lives and Saving Money." It calls for you and your
###3894 doctor and your pharmacist and your hospital have a relationship. I believe in something
###3898 like patient power. I didn't advocate federal mandates. I talked about it at a state level,
###3903 finding a way -- which included an escape clause that people didn't have to buy it -- finding
###3907 a way to try to have people have insurance, particularly for wealthy people who are simply
###3911 free-riding on local hospitals. But the fact is, it was a personal system, dramatically
###3917 different than either Romneycare or the version Rick just discussed.
###3919 >> BLITZER: Governor Romney?
###3920 >> ROMNEY: The system that we put in place in our state was something we worked out with
###3923 the labor community, the health care community, business, and the citizens of the nation.
###3928 We came together, it was voted by a 200-person legislature. Only two voted no. Our system
###3933 has a lot of flaws, a lot of things I'd do differently. It has a lot of benefits. The
###3938 people of the state like it by about three to one. We consider it very different than
###3942 Obamacare. If I were president, day one I will take action to repeal Obamacare. It's
###3947 bad medicine. It's bad economy. I'll repeal it.
###3951 >> [APPLAUSE]
###3952 >> ROMNEY: And I believe the people -- I believe the people of each state should be able to
###3955 craft programs that they feel are best for their people. I think ours is working pretty
###3959 well. If I were governor, it would work a heck of a lot better.
###3961 >> BLITZER: All right. And very quickly, go ahead.
###3963 >> SANTORUM: What Governor Romney just said is that government-run top-down medicine is
###3968 working pretty well in Massachusetts and he supports it. Now, think about what that means
###3973 --
###3973 >> ROMNEY: That's not what I said.
###3974 >> SANTORUM: -- going up against Barack Obama, who you are going to claim, well, top-down
###3977 government-run medicine on the federal level doesn't work and we should repeal it. And
###3980 he's going to say, wait a minute, Governor. You just said that top-down government-run
###3983 medicine in Massachusetts works well. Folks, we can't give this issue away in this election.
###3989 It is about fundamental freedom. Whether the United States government or even a state government
###3994 -- you have Amendment 1 [ph] here offered by Scott Pleitgen [ph], who, by the way, endorsed
###3999 me today, and it's going to be on your ballot as to whether there should be a government
###4004 mandate here in Florida. According to Governor Romney, that's OK. If the state does it, that's
###4008 OK. If the state wants to enforce it, that's OK. Those are not the clear contrasts we need
###4013 if we're going to defeat Barack Obama and a --
###4015 >> BLITZER: Let's go to Miami.
###4018 >> [APPLAUSE]
###4018 >> [CROSSTALK]
###4019 >> BLITZER: Very quickly.
###4020 >> ROMNEY: Rick, I make enough mistakes in what I say, not for you to add more mistakes
###4026 to what I say. I didn't say I'm in favor of top- down government-run health care, 92 percent
###4031 of the people in my state had insurance before our plan went in place. And nothing changes
###4036 for them. They own the same private insurance they had before. And for the 8 percent of
###4040 people who didn't have insurance, we said to them, if you can afford insurance, buy
###4045 it yourself, any one of the plans out there, you can choose any plan. There's no government
###4049 plan. And if you don't want to buy insurance, then you have to help pay for the cost of
###4054 the state picking up your bill, because under federal law if someone doesn't have insurance,
###4060 then we have to care for them in the hospitals, give them free care. So we said, no more,
###4064 no more free riders. We are insisting on personal responsibility. Either get the insurance or
###4070 help pay for your care. And that was the conclusion that we reached.
###4073 >> SANTORUM: Does everybody in Massachusetts have a requirement to buy health care?
###4076 >> ROMNEY: Everyone has a requirement to either buy it or pay the state for the cost of providing
###4081 them free care. Because the idea of people getting something for free when they could
###4086 afford to care for themselves is something that we decided in our state was not a good
###4090 idea.
###4090 >> SANTORUM: So, in Massachusetts...
###4092 >> [APPLAUSE]
###4092 >> SANTORUM: Just so I understand this, in Massachusetts, everybody is mandated as a
###4098 condition of breathing in Massachusetts, to buy health insurance, and if you don't, and
###4104 if you don't, you have to pay a fine. What has happened in Massachusetts is that people
###4109 are now paying the fine because health insurance is so expensive. And you have a pre-existing
###4114 condition clause in yours, just like Barack Obama. So what is happening in Massachusetts,
###4118 the people that Governor Romney said he wanted to go after, the people that were free-riding,
###4123 free ridership has gone up five-fold in Massachusetts. Five times the rate it was before. Why? Because...
###4128 >> ROMNEY: That's total, complete...
###4129 >> SANTORUM: I'll be happy to give you the study. Five times the rate it has gone up.
###4133 Why? Because people are ready to pay a cheaper fine and then be able to sign up to insurance,
###4138 which are now guaranteed under "Romney-care," than pay high cost insurance, which is what
###4143 has happened as a result of "Romney-care."
###4145 >> ROMNEY: First of all, it's not worth getting angry about. Secondly, the...
###4151 >> [APPLAUSE]
###4152 >> ROMNEY: Secondly, 98 percent of the people have insurance. And so the idea that more
###4159 people are free-riding the system is simply impossible. Half of those people got insurance
###4164 on their own. Others got help in buying the insurance. Look, I know you don't like the
###4169 plan that we had. I don't like the Obama plan. His plan cuts Medicare by $500 billion. We
###4175 didn't, of course, touch anything like that. He raises taxes by $500 billion. We didn't
###4181 do that. He wasn't interested in the 8 percent of the people that were uninsured. He was
###4186 concerned about the 100 percent of the people of the country. "Obama-care" takes over health
###4192 care for the American people. If I'm president of the United States, I will stop it. And
###4196 in debating Barack Obama, I will be able to show that I have passion and concern for the
###4201 people in this country that need health care, like this young woman who asked the question.
###4205 But I will be able to point out that what he did was wrong. It was bad medicine, it's
###4208 bad for the economy, and I will repeal it.
###4211 >> [APPLAUSE]
###4211 >> BLITZER: Let's move on, let's move on.
###4214 >> SANTORUM: Wolf, what Governor Romney said is just factually incorrect. Your mandate
###4220 is no different than Barack Obama's mandate. It is the same mandate. He takes over...
###4225 >> [APPLAUSE]
###4225 >> BLITZER: All right. All right.
###4226 >> SANTORUM: You take over 100 percent, just like he takes over 100 percent, requires the
###4230 mandate. The same fines that you put in place in Massachusetts are fines that he puts in
###4235 place in the federal level. Same programs.
###4236 >> BLITZER: Congressman Paul, who is right?
###4238 >> PAUL: I think they're all wrong.
###4240 >> [LAUGHTER]
###4241 >> [APPLAUSE]
###4242 >> PAUL: I think this -- this is a typical result of when you get government involved,
###4247 because all you are arguing about is which form of government you want. They have way
###4251 too much confidence in government sorting this out. So, I would say there's a much better
###4257 way. And that is allow the people to make their decisions and not get the government
###4261 involved. You know, it has only been...
###4263 >> [APPLAUSE]
###4263 >> PAUL: When I started medicine, there was no Medicare or Medicaid. And nobody was out
###4268 in the streets without it. Now, now people are suffering, all the complaints going on.
###4273 So the government isn't our solution. So, I'm not too happy with this type of debate,
###4279 trying to blame one versus the other, so, but -- most likely we're going to continue
###4286 to have this problem unless we straighten out the economy. And that means...
###4288 >> BLITZER: I'll give you 30 seconds, Mr. Speaker. PAUL: ... cut the spending. And they
###4291 talk about these new programs and all, but how many of the other candidates are willing
###4296 to cut anything? I'm willing to cut $1 trillion out of the first year.
###4300 >> [APPLAUSE]
###4300 >> BLITZER: All right.
###4301 >> GINGRICH: Well, I just want to say that I actually think if you look at what Ron Paul's
###4307 background is as a doctor, and you look at medicine in the early '60s, and you look at
###4312 how communities solved problems, it was a fundamentally more flexible and less expensive
###4318 system. And there's a lot to be said for rethinking from the ground up, the entire approach to
###4323 health care.
###4323 >> BLITZER: Let's go to Miami. We have another question.
###4325 >> [APPLAUSE]
###4326 >> BLITZER: CNN Espanol's Juan Carlos Lopez is standing by. Go ahead?
###4330 >> LOPEZ: Yes, Wolf, our question now comes from Jennifer Coryn [ph] she is a -- the Executive
###4336 Director of the Hispanic Leadership Network, our cosponsor and she is the spouse of a Marine
###4341 Corps Gunnery Sargent and I believe, Jennifer, your question has to do with the future?
###4344 >> QUESTION: Yes. Thank you very much and good evening. We have many qualified, Hispanic
###4349 leaders. Which of our Hispanic leaders would you consider to serve in your cabinet?
###4353 >> BLITZER: Senator Santorum?
###4354 >> SANTORUM:: Well, I mean I hate to throw one to Florida, but obviously your Senator
###4357 Marco Rubio is a pretty impressive guy.
###4360 >> [APPLAUSE]
###4361 >> BLITZER: Speaker Gingrich?
###4365 >> GINGRICH: I think that there are a number, and I think for example of -- of when you
###4370 think cabinet, I think for example of Susana Martinez, the governor of New Mexico. You
###4374 know, at the cabinet level I think of somebody like Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. I actually thought
###4378 about Marco Rubio on a slightly more dignified and central role, then being in the cabinet,
###4382 but that's another conversation.
###4384 >> [APPLAUSE]
###4385 >> BLITZER: Governor?
###4388 >> ROMNEY: We -- we are blessed -- we're blessed to have an enormous number of highly qualified
###4393 Hispanic-Americans in the Republican Party and leadership right now. Brian Sandoval,
###4397 the governor of -- of Nevada. You mentioned Susana Martinez in New Mexico. I -- both of
###4402 the Diaz-Belart brothers, one retired from Congress, the other currently there. Ileana
###4407 Ros-Lehtinen, Mel Martinez is back in the private sector. Who knows, he could be pulled
###4411 back. Of course, Senator Marco Rubio a -- a terrific Hispanic- American. I -- I'm sure
###4415 I'm missing many, many others, but we have a -- a remarkable -- Carlos Gutierrez, formerly
###4421 secretary of Commerce. These individuals can for membership in our -- in our cabinet, I
###4426 believe. And -- and potentially as the -- as the speaker indicates, other positions as
###4431 well.
###4431 >> PAUL: I -- I -- I don't have one particular name that I'm going to bring up, but my litmus
###4435 test would be to get individuals, Hispanic or otherwise to understand monetary policy
###4441 and understand the system. But also the Hispanic community is especially attuned to the foreign
###4447 policy of non-intervention. They -- they are more opposed to war than other communities,
###4453 so I would think there's plenty in the Hispanic community that could give me good advice and
###4458 an understanding of why a non-intervention foreign policy is very attractive to the Hispanic
###4463 people.
###4463 >> BLITZER: All right, gentleman stand by. Much more to discuss. I want to take a short
###4467 break. We have many more topics to include -- including this, we'll get into this a little
###4472 bit, what would your wife -- why would your wife make the best first lady. I'll ask these
###4478 four candidates. Stay with us.
###4480 >> [APPLAUSE]
###4480 >> [COMMERCIAL BREAK]
###4482 >> BLITZER: I'm Wolf Blitzer. We're here in Jacksonville for CNN's Florida Republican
###4488 presidential debate. Many of you are watching online, commenting on Twitter, Facebook, at
###4494 CNN.com. We have many more questions for the candidates, including one that hits close
###4501 to home. Stand by to find out why each man on this stage thinks his wife would be the
###4511 best first lady.
###4512 >> [COMMERCIAL BREAK]
###4513 >> BLITZER: Want to get right back to the rest of the debate, but first, on a lighter
###4523 subject, I want to ask each of these gentlemen why they think their wife would make a great
###4529 first lady. Congressman Paul?
###4531 >> PAUL: Well, she's been my wife for 54 years. And we're going to have an anniversary on
###4535 February 1st.
###4537 >> BLITZER: Congratulations.
###4538 >> PAUL: So -- but she's the mother of five of our children, and she's a grandmother of
###4544 18 grandchildren, does an excellent job. And she's also the author of a very famous cookbook,
###4550 "The Ron Paul Cookbook."
###4551 >> BLITZER: Governor?
###4552 >> ROMNEY: I've got to take a little bit more time, a little more seriousness. My -- nothing
###4559 wrong with what you said -- I'm sorry. My wife is also a mom, as I pointed out early
###4565 on, but in some respects, she is a real champion and a fighter. She was diagnosed in 1998 with
###4572 Multiple Sclerosis, and more recently with breast cancer. She has battled both successfully.
###4578 And as first lady, she will be able to reach out to people who are also struggling and
###4581 suffering and will be someone who shows compassion and care. And she's also had a passion all
###4588 of her adult life on helping people in troubled situations, young women in particular, understand
###4593 the importance of getting married before they have babies and encouraging people to create
###4597 families to raise kids in.
###4600 >> [APPLAUSE]
###4601 >> GINGRICH: Let me say, first of all, having gotten to know them, I think all three of
###4610 the wives represented here would be terrific first ladies. Callista and I have gotten to
###4614 know all three of them, and we think they'd be fabulous people. So I would rather just
###4617 to talk about why I like Callista, and why I'd like her to be first lady, but she's not
###4620 necessarily in any way better. These are wonderful people, and they would be wonderful first
###4625 ladies. But Callista brings a couple of things. One is a tremendous artistic focus. She's
###4629 done a video in music education, why it really matters. She's a pianist by background, plays
###4634 the French horn in a community band, sings in the choir of the Basilica of the National
###4637 Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. She really cares about the arts and would bring a really
###4641 strong feeling for music education and for art, and why it matters to people as part
###4645 of their education. She's also very patriotic about American exceptionalism. She's had a
###4649 best-selling "New York Times" book, children's book, and has really reached out to young
###4654 people to get them to understand America. And she's helped produce and host seven movies
###4659 now, so she would bring an entire, I think, artistic flavor. But -- and I, obviously,
###4663 would be thrilled to be able to hang out with her at the White House. So it would be good.
###4667 >> BLITZER: And I suspect you would be. Unfortunately, Senator Santorum, your wife is not here tonight.
###4672 >> SANTORUM: Yeah, she's not. She's -- she's doing what she does incredibly well, which
###4676 is to be a mother to our seven children. And she is -- she's my hero. She's someone who
###4684 has been, you know, well- educated. She was a neo-natal intensive care nurse for nine
###4691 years at one of the most advanced nurseries in the -- in the country. She went on to,
###4698 because she saw all these ethical challenges there, so she went on and got a law degree
###4701 so she could -- she could deal with those in the -- in the legal world. And then when
###4706 she got married, she gave that up; she walked away and walked into something that she felt
###4711 called to do, which was to be a mom and to be a wife. And we've -- we've had eight children.
###4716 We are blessed to be raising seven. We've been through a lot together, losing a child,
###4723 having a child with a disability that we have now, our little Bella. And the -- the amount
###4728 of love for these special kids is just palpable in her. She wrote a book about our son that
###4736 we lost called "Letters to Gabriel," about that ordeal that we went through. That book,
###4741 that little book has saved countless -- I don't -- we know of at least hundreds of lives
###4746 that were saved because people read that book and realized that the child they we're carrying
###4752 had the dignity to be love and nurtured irrespective of what malady may have -- may have befallen
###4760 that baby in the womb. And so many children were born and are alive today because of that
###4766 book. She's also written a book on manners. That's something that I -- I -- we have seven
###4773 children, so we know that kids are not born good. And...
###4776 >> [LAUGHTER]
###4777 >> SANTORUM: and so manners is very important in our house. And she wrote a storybook because
###4782 there were all sorts of how-to books on manners but there was no storybook, teaching manners
###4786 through, well, how Christ taught us, through stories. And -- and that's what she did. And
###4791 that book has hopefully somewhat civilized some children around this country.
###4795 >> [LAUGHTER]
###4795 >> BLITZER: Very nice. All right, let's get back to the debate -- the debate now.
###4803 >> [APPLAUSE]
###4804 >> BLITZER: Governor Romney, you criticized Speaker Gingrich for not being as close to
###4809 Ronald Reagan as he says he was. When you ran for the Senate, you said you were, quote,
###4815 "You weren't trying to return to Reagan-Bush." So the question is, do you think you can claim
###4820 the Reagan mantle more than Speaker Gingrich?
###4822 >> ROMNEY: Oh, of course not. No, I -- I was -- at the time Ronald Reagan was -- was president,
###4828 I was just getting started. I went through school, came out of school, got my first job,
###4834 worked my way up in a consulting company, and then, after awhile, started a business
###4839 of my own. I was looking at politics from afar and learning as time went on. I didn't
###4844 get involved in politics early in my life. I instead spent my time building a business.
###4850 And then later, as my business had been successful and we'd been involved in some turnaround
###4854 situations, some businesses in trouble that we were able to help -- not all worked out
###4857 as we'd hoped, but a number did -- I got asked to go off and help get the Salt Lake City
###4862 Olympics in 2002 on track and put aside my business and went -- went to Utah. And it
###4869 was perhaps the greatest professional experience of my life, going there and spending three
###4873 years helping getting those games on track. I -- I happen to believe the Olympics is one
###4877 of the great showcases of the -- of the human spirit that exists in the media world. And
###4882 it was very successful. And then -- and then, after that, I was asked by some friends to
###4886 come back and run for governor, did that. And that's when I became terribly politically
###4889 involved. And in that involvement, I learned a lot of lessons. Being governor taught me
###4894 a lot of things. I became more conservative, by the way, as I was governor, and found the
###4899 importance of lowering taxes, making it easier for businesses to grow, the importance of
###4903 driving schools to be the best in the country. Those are the things I did. And so I'm not
###4908 suggesting -- the speaker was a congressman at the time Ronald Reagan was president, so
###4912 he -- he, of course, was closer to the Ronald Reagan era than I.
###4915 >> BLITZER: Mr. Speaker, you've heard the criticism lately that you weren't necessarily
###4918 as close to the president as you suggest?
###4922 >> GINGRICH: Well, it's increasingly interesting to watch the Romney attack machine coordinate
###4927 things. And all of a sudden, today, there are like four different articles by four different
###4930 people that randomly show up. The fact is, I'm thrilled that Michael Reagan has endorsed
###4935 me and will be campaigning with me here in Florida. I remember very fondly, in 1995,
###4939 when we were at the Goldwater Institute and Nancy Reagan said, you know, "Barry gave Ronnie
###4946 the torch, and now Ronny's passing the torch to Newt and his team in Congress. So I think
###4952 it's reasonable to say, and I think the governor said it fairly, I am vastly closer to Reagan.
###4957 In that period the governor was an independent business person. In '92 he was donating to
###4962 the Democrats for Congress and voted for Paul Tsongas in the Democratic primary. In '94
###4966 running against Teddy Kennedy, he said flatly, I don't want to go back to the Reagan-Bush
###4969 era, I was an independent. So there's a pretty wide gap. Now, he's more mature. He's more
###4976 conservative, I accept that. I think it's a good thing. But those of us who were in
###4979 the trenches fighting in the '80's, it would be nice to be recognized for what we actually
###4983 did and not to have orchestrated attacks to try to distort the history of that period.
###4987 >> BLITZER: Governor Romney, you can respond please.
###4991 >> [APPLAUSE]
###4991 >> ROMNEY: Just a -- just a short clarification. I -- I've never voted for a Democrat when
###4997 there was a Republican on the ballot. And -- and in my state of Massachusetts, you could
###5001 register as an independent and go vote in which -- either primary happens to be very
###5005 interesting. And any chance I got to vote against Bill Clinton or Ted Kennedy, I took.
###5010 And so I -- I'm...
###5013 >> [APPLAUSE]
###5014 >> ROMNEY: ...I have voted -- I have always voted for a Republican any time there was
###5020 a Republican on the ballot. With regards to the Speaker's involvement in the Reagan years,
###5025 he can speak for himself. The Reagan Diaries and the other histories that were written
###5029 at that time can lay that out as well. I -- I -- I think, I think what he said speaks for
###5034 itself and I'm proud of the things I was able to accomplish.
###5036 >> BLITZER: Let's take another question from the audience. Go ahead. Please stand up and
###5040 give us your name?
###5040 >> QUESTION: Hi, my name is George Miatus [ph], I live here in Jacksonville and when
###5044 I was 3-years-old I was very blessed that my parents brought me here from Cuba. They
###5049 brought me here so that I could be raised in freedom and in liberty. President Obama
###5053 has recently announced that he is liberalizing trade and travel policies. What would be your
###5059 position as president toward the island of Cuba?
###5061 >> BLITZER: Senator Santorum?
###5062 >> SANTORUM: I would oppose it. I've been 100 percent in support of the Cuban people
###5070 and their right to have a free Cuba and the United States should stand on the side of
###5075 the Cuban people against these despots who are not just reigning terror, continuing reign
###5081 of terror in Cuba. But now have their -- their -- their puppet, Chavez in -- in Venezuela
###5088 and Noriega and Morales and it keeps -- it keeps like a cancer growing. So the idea that
###5096 a president of the United States would take the heart of the cancer that is in Central
###5101 and South America, and begin to reward behavior that has spread this cancer because of our
###5109 dilly-dallying and our inattentiveness to the problems in Central and South America.
###5114 Now, we're going to reward the secret police. We're going to [inaudible] president of Venezuela
###5119 as they are in Cuba. We're going to reward this type of thuggery, this type of Marxism
###5125 in our region. We're going to reward a country that is now working with these other countries
###5130 to harbor and bring in Iran and the terrorist -- the Jihadist's who want to set up missile
###5137 sites and to set up training camps. And so we're going to reward this behavior by opening
###5142 up and liberalizing. This is the exact wrong message at the exact wrong time.
###5147 >> BLITZER: Congressman Paul...
###5148 >> [APPLAUSE]
###5148 >> BLITZER: ...you said the U.S. should talk to everyone. Imagine you're in the Oval Office,
###5154 you speak to Raul Castro. What would you say to him?
###5158 >> PAUL: Well, I'd ask him what he called about, you know?
###5162 >> [LAUGHTER]
###5163 >> PAUL: What was the purpose of his call? No, I would ask him what can -- what can we
###5168 do to improve relations? Because I wouldn't see them as likely to attack us. When I was
###5174 drafted in October of '62, that was a different world. I mean there were nuclear weapons in
###5180 Cuba. That was a different story. But -- but today to -- not to talk to them and take the
###5185 call and see what you can work out, helps -- helps Castro. It hurts the people, the
###5191 dissidents, the people who want to overthrow him have always had to be, you know, nationalistic
###5196 and unified behind the leader. So as well intended as these sanctions are, they almost
###5201 inevitably backfire and they help the dictators and hurt the people.
###5206 >> [APPLAUSE]
###5206 >> PAUL: So it's time to change. The Cold -- the Cold War -- the Cold War is over. They're
###5213 not going to invade us and I just think that a better relationship and trade relationship,
###5219 so many people -- I think -- I've noticed already since I've been talking about this
###5223 issue the last four of five years, I think the people have changed their mind. It's very
###5228 -- the American people are getting much more open. Not nearly as frightened. And people
###5231 -- I don't think they see a Jihadist under the bed every night...
###5235 >> [LAUGHTER]
###5236 >> PAUL: ...and we have to worry about that. I think there's -- I -- I worry about overreaction,
###5242 over concern and lack of ability to talk to them when they call you.
###5245 >> BLITZER: I want both of you to weigh in, Governor Romney first?
###5247 >> ROMNEY: Two -- two major flaws with President Obama's foreign policy.
###5250 >> [CROSSTALK]
###5250 >> BLITZER: Well what about Ron Paul's policy?
###5253 >> ROMNEY: Well, I'm talking about President Obama right now. We can get back to Ron Paul
###5257 in a moment.
###5260 >> [APPLAUSE]
###5260 >> ROMNEY: First of all, I think the president has largely ignored Latin America, Cuba in
###5265 particular, Venezuela, and other nations. I think we have to change that dramatically.
###5269 I think we have to have economic initiatives to build trade throughout Latin America, particularly
###5274 with Colombia and Panama, now part of free trade agreements. I want more of that throughout
###5278 Latin America. But that's the first flaw, ignoring Latin America. And number two is
###5283 reaching out with accommodations to some of the world's worst actors, whether it was Putin
###5288 in Russia, giving him what he wanted, or Castro, saying we're going to let you have remittances
###5291 coming from the U.S. to fund your future, or relaxed trade restrictions. Throughout
###5296 the world, with Ahmadinejad opening an open hand, tyrants look for weakness to take advantage.
###5302 That's the wrong course. The right course for Cuba is to continue to honor Helms-Burton.
###5306 And if I'm president of the United States, I will use every resource we have, short of
###5311 invasion and military action, Congressman Paul. I'll use every resource we can to make
###5316 sure that when Fidel Castro finally leaves this planet, that we are able to help the
###5322 people of Cuba enjoy freedom. They want it. It's a God-given right. And it is our responsibility
###5327 to help share the gift of freedom with people throughout the world that are seeking it.
###5331 >> [APPLAUSE]
###5331 >> BLITZER: Are you open -- Mr. Speaker, are you open to improving relations with Cuba?
###5337 >> GINGRICH: Well, let me start with where the governor correctly pointed out. I was
###5341 very proud as Speaker to be able to make sure that the Helms-Burton Act passed, and I'm
###5346 delighted that Congressman Dan Burton is here tonight and is campaigning with me, because
###5350 it was a very important step towards isolating the Castro regime. I think it's amazing that
###5355 Barack Obama is worried about an Arab Spring, he's worried about Tunisia, he's worried about
###5360 Libya, he's worried about Egypt, he's worried about Syria, and he cannot bring himself to
###5365 look south and imagine a Cuban Spring. And I would argue that we should have, as a stated
###5371 explicit policy, that we want to facilitate the transition from the dictatorship to freedom.
###5376 We want to bring together every non-military asset we have, exactly as President Reagan
###5381 and Prime Minister Thatcher and Pope John Paul II did in Poland and in Eastern Europe.
###5386 They broke up the Soviet empire without a general war by using a wide range of things,
###5391 one of which is just psychological, saying to the next generation of people in Cuba,
###5395 the dictatorship is not going to survive. You need to bet to moving to freedom in order
###5400 to have prosperity in Cuba, and we will help you get to that freedom.
###5405 >> [APPLAUSE]
###5405 >> BLITZER: Let's take another question from the audience. Please give us your name and
###5410 tell us where you are from.
###5411 >> [QUESTION]: Abraham Hassel [ph] from Jacksonville, Florida. How would a Republican administration
###5417 help bring peace to Palestine and Israel when most candidates barely recognize the existence
###5423 of Palestine or its people? As a Palestinian-American Republican, I'm here to tell you we do exist.
###5430 >> BLITZER: All right. Let's ask Governor Romney, first of all. What would you say to
###5435 Abraham?
###5435 >> ROMNEY: Well, the reason that there's not peace between the Palestinians and Israel
###5441 is because there is -- in the leadership of the Palestinian people are Hamas and others
###5446 who think like Hamas, who have as their intent the elimination of Israel. And whether it's
###5451 in school books that teach how to kill Jews, or whether it's in the political discourse
###5455 that is spoken either from Fatah or from Hamas, there is a belief that the Jewish people do
###5462 not have a right to have a Jewish state. There are some people who say, should we have a
###5467 two-state solution? And the Israelis would be happy to have a two-state solution. It's
###5471 the Palestinians who don't want a two-state solution. They want to eliminate the state
###5474 of Israel. And I believe America must say -- and the best way to have peace in the Middle
###5478 East is not for us to vacillate and to appease, but is to say, we stand with our friend Israel.
###5484 We are committed to a Jewish state in Israel. We will not have an inch of difference between
###5489 ourselves and our ally, Israel. This president went before the United Nations and castigated
###5494 Israel for building settlements. He said nothing about thousands of rockets being rained in
###5498 on Israel from the Gaza Strip. This president threw --
###5504 >> [APPLAUSE]
###5506 >> ROMNEY: I think he threw Israel under the bus with regards to defining the '67 borders
###5515 as a starting point of negotiations. I think he disrespected Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
###5522 I think he has time and time again shown distance from Israel, and that has created, in my view,
###5527 a greater sense of aggression on the part of the Palestinians. I will stand with our
###5531 friend, Israel.
###5532 >> BLITZER: Thank you, Governor.
###5532 >> [APPLAUSE]
###5533 >> BLITZER: Speaker Gingrich, you got into a little hot water when you said the Palestinians
###5537 were an invented people. GINGRICH: It was technically an invention of the late 1970s,
###5543 and it was clearly so. Prior to that, they were Arabs. Many of them were either Syrian,
###5547 Lebanese, or Egyptian, or Jordanian. There are a couple of simple things here. There
###5553 were 11 rockets fired into Israel in November. Now, imagine in Duvall County that 11 rockets
###5562 hit from your neighbor. How many of you would be for a peace process and how many of you
###5568 would say, you know, that looks like an act of war. You have leadership unequivocally,
###5572 and Governor Romney is exactly right, the leadership of Hamas says, not a single Jew
###5576 will remain. We aren't having a peace negotiation then. This is war by another form. My goal
###5582 for the Palestinian people would be to live in peace, to live in prosperity, to have the
###5587 dignity of a state, to have freedom. and they can achieve it any morning they are prepared
###5592 to say Israel has a right to exist, we give up the right to return, and we recognize that
###5598 we're going to live side-by-side, now let's work together to create mutual prosperity.
###5602 And you could in five years dramatically improve the quality of life of every Palestinian.
###5607 But the political leadership would never tolerate that. And that's why we're in a continuous
###5612 state of war where Obama undermines the Israelis. On the first day that I'm president, if I
###5617 do become president, I will sign an executive order directing the State Department to move
###5622 the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send the signal we're with Israel.
###5626 >> [APPLAUSE]
###5626 >> BLITZER: Let's go to Miami. Let's take another question from Miami. Juan Carlos,
###5632 go ahead?
###5634 >> LOPEZ: Thank you, Wolf. I'm joined now by Elizabeth Cuevas- Neunder. She is the CEO
###5639 and founder of the Puerto Rican Chamber of Commerce in Florida. She is based out of Tampa.
###5644 And I'm pretty sure, Elizabeth, your question has to do with the beautiful island of Puerto
###5648 Rico.
###5648 >> ELIZABETH CUEVAS: [SPEAKING IN SPANISH]. Good evening. [SPEAKING IN SPANISH]. I am
###5653 bilingual, proud of it. My question to the candidates, we have 4 million Puerto Ricans
###5660 in the United States, voters, 3.8 in Puerto Rico. We have been treated as second class
###5668 citizen and just now our governor's name was not mentioned as a V.P. possibility, a great
###5674 governor. My question to you is, where do you stand for Puerto Rico to become a state?
###5679 And secondly, how do you -- where do you stand on domestic trade between Florida and Puerto
###5686 Rico, between Tampa Bay and Ponce ports which have been neglected? Thank you. BLITZER: All
###5691 right. Senator Santorum, let's throw that question to you. The question about, do you
###5694 support Puerto Rico potentially as the 51st state?
###5696 >> SANTORUM: Well, first, I will give a shout-out to Governor Luis Fortuno, who is a good friend
###5701 of mine, and someone -- I know him and his family, we have known each other for many
###5705 years, we actually used to go to church together. And so I spoke to Luis this week. And I've
###5711 been to Puerto Rico many times. And actually, when I was a United States senator, we did
###5715 a lot of work with Puerto Rico. Because of my relationship with many friends down there,
###5721 I was made aware of problems, for example, in the Medicaid program. We went down and
###5725 we actually passed things to help with reimbursement rates, which were deplorably low in Puerto
###5734 Rico. We also worked on hurricane relief and a whole lost of other things as a result of
###5740 my relationship with many Puerto Ricans in Pennsylvania, and developed those relationships
###5746 on the island. I believe that -- I believe in self-determination. That, you know, the
###5752 Puerto Rican people should have the opportunity to be able to be able to speak on this. I
###5756 have supported that. I don't take a position one way or the other on statehood, commonwealth,
###5760 independence, that's for the people of Puerto Rico to decide. But I also supported a lot
###5765 of things to help the Puerto Rican economy. Puerto Ricans are United States citizens,
###5770 and the poverty, the unemployment rates simply are -- are simply not something that we as
###5777 Americans should allow to occur in our country. And we need to make sure that there are pro-growth,
###5784 supply side economics to make sure that Puerto Rico can be successful as an economy on that
###5791 island, and I believe they can. And under my administration, that's something that I
###5794 would work towards.
###5795 >> BLITZER: I'll take that as a maybe. Statehood, not statehood.
###5799 >> SANTORUM: No, I take no position on that. That's -- I would -- I've supported, you know,
###5804 the opportunity for them to make that decision.
###5806 >> BLITZER: Let's take another question from the audience here. Go ahead, please. What
###5809 is your name?
###5810 >> SUZANNE BASS: Suzanne Bass, I'm an attorney in Jacksonville. Welcome to the great city
###5814 of Jacksonville. My question, how would your religious beliefs, if you're elected, impact
###5823 the decisions that you make in the office of the presidency?
###5827 >> BLITZER: Congressman Paul?
###5829 >> PAUL: Well, my religious beliefs wouldn't affect it. My religious beliefs affect my
###5833 character in the way I treat people and the way I live. The only thing it would affect...
###5837 >> [APPLAUSE]
###5838 >> PAUL: The only thing that would affect me in the way I operate as a president or
###5847 a congressman is my oath of office and my promises that I've made to the people.
###5852 >> BLITZER: Governor?
###5855 >> ROMNEY: Ron Paul makes very good point. I concur with that. I would also seek the
###5861 guidance of -- of providence in making critical decisions. And of course, ours is a nation
###5867 which is based upon Judeo- Christian values and ethics. Our law is based upon those values
###5872 and ethics. And in some cases, our law doesn't encompass -- encompass all of the issues that
###5877 we face around the world. The conviction that the founders, when they wrote the Declaration
###5882 of Independence, were writing a document that was not just temporary and not just for one
###5887 small locale but really something which described the relationship between God and man -- that's
###5892 something which I think a president would carry in his heart. So when they said, for
###5896 instance, that the creator had "endowed us with certain unalienable rights, among them
###5900 life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness," I would seek to assure that those principles
###5906 and values remain in America and that we help share them with other people in the world,
###5911 not by conquering them, but by helping them through our trade, through our various forms
###5916 of soft power, to help bring people the joy and -- and -- and opportunity that exists
###5921 in this great land.
###5925 >> BLITZER: Mr. Speaker?
###5929 >> [APPLAUSE]
###5930 >> GINGRICH: I would say that there are three ways in which religion would affect me. The
###5936 first is, I agree with Governor Romney. I think anyone who is president is faced with
###5942 decisions so enormous that they should go to God. They should seek guidance. Because
###5949 these are decisions beyond the ability of mere mortals to truly decide without some
###5953 sense of what it is we should be doing. I would say, second, that we have a real obligation
###5960 to recognize that, if you're truly faithful, it's not just an hour on Sundays or Saturdays
###5965 or Fridays. It's in fact something that should suffuse your life, to be a part of who you
###5969 are. And in that sense, it is inextricably tied in with how you behave. But I would say,
###5974 third, one of the reasons I am running is there has been an increasingly aggressive
###5978 war against religion and in particular against Christianity in this country, largely by...
###5985 >> [APPLAUSE]
###5988 >> GINRICH: largely by a secular elite and the academic news media and judicial areas.
###5994 And I frankly believe it's important to have some leadership that stands up and says, enough;
###5999 we are truly guaranteed the right of religious freedom, not religious suppression by the
###6004 state.
###6006 >> [APPLAUSE]
###6007 >> BLITZER: Senator?
###6010 >> SANTORUM: Faith is a very, very important part of my life, but it's a very, very important
###6013 part of this country. The foundational documents of our country -- everybody talks about the
###6018 Constitution, very, very important. But the Constitution is the "how" of America. It's
###6021 the operator's manual. The "why" of America, who we are as a people, is in the Declaration
###6027 of Independence, "We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal
###6030 and endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights." The Constitution is there
###6037 to do one thing: protect God-given rights. That's what makes America different than every
###6043 other country in the world. No other country in the world has its rights -- rights based
###6048 in God-given rights, not government-given rights. And so when you say, well, faith has
###6054 nothing to do with it, faith has everything to do with it. If rights come...
###6060 >> [APPLAUSE]
###6062 >> SANTORUM: If our president believes that rights come to us from the state, everything
###6071 government gives you, it can take away. The role of the government is to protect rights
###6077 that cannot be taken away. And so the answer to that question is, I believe in faith and
###6082 reason and approaching the problems of this country but understand where those rights
###6087 come from, who we are as Americans and the foundational principles by which we have changed
###6093 the world.
###6094 >> BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.
###6095 >> [APPLAUSE]
###6095 >> BLITZER: We have one more break to take, but we have a lot more to discuss. Don't go
###6099 too far away. Coming up, the final debate question before Florida votes.
###6106 >> [APPLAUSE]
###6108 >> [COMMERCIAL BREAK]
###6112 >> BLITZER: All right. We're in the last few minutes of the last question to these four
###6125 presidential candidates before the Florida primary on Tuesday in this debate format.
###6131 Here is the question, and it involves the president of the United States. I want you
###6136 to tell voters who are watching or are here on this campus right now why you are the one
###6141 person on this stage that is most likely to beat Barack Obama. Congressman?
###6148 >> PAUL: Well, you know, so far, we have some pretty good evidence that I'll do quite well
###6153 and have a better chance than the rest to beat him, because if you do a national poll,
###6157 I do very, very well against Obama. But one of the reasons is, is that the freedom message
###6164 in the Constitution is very appealing to everybody in all political beliefs because it includes
###6172 free markets, which conservatives endorse, but it also protects civil liberties, the
###6177 way people run their lives. If it is a God-given life, and it's your life, you should have
###6183 the right to run your life as you so choose as long as you don't harm other people. This
###6187 means a lot more tolerance that some would like to give. So that brings people in who
###6191 are concerned about civil liberties, and all of a sudden, my position undermines Obama
###6197 completely and totally because the foreign policy is different. He promises to end the
###6202 wars, but the wars expand. A constitutional foreign policy will end the wars. And if you
###6207 want somebody to talk about peace and prosperity, it has to be somebody who understands money
###6212 and a foreign policy and free markets.
###6215 >> [APPLAUSE]
###6215 >> BLITZER: Governor Romney, why are you the one person on this stage most likely to beat
###6221 President Obama?
###6222 >> ROMNEY: The people of America recognize that this is a critical time. This is not
###6226 just an average election. This is a time where we're going to decide whether America will
###6230 remain the great hope of the 21st century, whether this will be an American century,
###6234 or, instead, whether we'll continue to go down a path to become more and more like Europe,
###6238 a social welfare state. That's where we're headed. Our economy is becoming weaker. The
###6243 foundation of our future economy is being eroded. Government has become too large. We're
###6247 headed in a very dangerous direction. I believe to get America back on track, we're going
###6251 to have to have dramatic, fundamental, extraordinary change in Washington to be able to allow our
###6256 private sector to once again reemerge competitively, to scale back the size of government and to
###6262 maintain our strength abroad in our military capacities. I believe that, to change Washington
###6267 in such a dramatic way, you cannot do it by people who have been there their entire careers.
###6272 I believe, if you just elect the same people to change chairs in Washington, not much happen.
###6277 I think, if you want to change Washington, you're going to have to bring someone in who
###6280 has been on the outside. I have lived in the private sector. I know how it works. I've
###6285 competed with businesses around the world. I know how to win. I know what it takes to
###6289 keep America strong. I know how to work in government. I've had experience for -- four
###6293 years, rather, working as the governor of Massachusetts. I will use the experience of
###6297 my life to get America right. And I will be able to convince the American people that
###6301 someone with my experience is very different than Barack Obama. And that experience is
###6306 how I'll beat him.
###6307 >> [APPLAUSE]
###6308 >> BLITZER: Mr. Speaker...
###6310 >> [APPLAUSE]
###6310 >> BLITZER: why are you the one person on this stage most likely to beat President Obama?
###6318 >> GINGRICH: You know, I have participated in the two largest Republican sweeps in modern
###6324 time, 1980, in the Reagan campaign, and 1994, with the Contract with America, which had
###6331 the largest one-party increase in American history, 9 million extra votes. I believe
###6336 that what we need this fall is a big-choice election that goes to the heart of who we
###6342 are. I'm running more than anything for my two grandchildren, Maggie and Robert. I'd
###6347 like them to be able to look back 50 years from now and say that what we did, what we
###6353 the American people did, the choice we made in 2012 to unleash the American people, to
###6359 rebuild our country based on the core values, to pose for the American people a simple choice:
###6365 Do you want freedom and independence and a paycheck and a job, or do you want dependence
###6370 and big government and food stamps and a lack of future? And I believe, if we have a big
###6376 election with truly historic big choices, that we can defeat Barack Obama by a huge
###6382 margin. But it won't be by running just as a Republican. It will be an American campaign
###6388 open to every American who prefers a paycheck to food stamps, who prefers the Declaration
###6394 of Independence to Saul Alinsky and who prefers a strong national security to trying to appease
###6399 our enemies.
###6399 >> [APPLAUSE]
###6400 >> BLITZER: Senator?
###6401 >> [APPLAUSE]
###6401 >> BLITZER: I'll repeat the question for you. Why do you think you're the best, most qualified
###6409 person on this stage to beat President Obama?
###6412 >> SANTORUM: I agree with the previous two speakers that this is a big election. This
###6415 is an election about fundamental freedom. It's about who America is going to be. Are
###6418 we a country that's going to be built great from the bottom up, as our founders intended,
###6423 or from the top down? I just think I'm a lot better than the previous two speakers to be
###6427 able to make that case to the American people. I'm not for a top- down government-run health
###6431 care system. I wasn't for the Wall Street bailouts like these two gentlemen were. Governor
###6436 Romney talks about the private sector and how he's going to bring private sector. When
###6439 the private sector was in trouble, he voted for government to come in and take over the
###6443 private sector and be able to -- and to bail them out. Cap-and-trade -- both of them bought
###6449 into the global warming hoax, bought into the cap-and-trade, top-down control of our
###6453 energy and manufacturing sector. If you look at President Obama's speech the other night,
###6458 what did he lead with? He lead with manufacturing. He led with manufacturing why? Because the
###6463 base of his party, the ones that are always the ones -- not the base -- the swing vote
###6469 in his party, the ones that Ronald Reagan was able to get -- we call them Reagan Democrats
###6474 up in Pennsylvania. Those are the blue-collar working people of America who know that this
###6478 president has left them behind. He has a plan for them, and it's more dependency, not work,
###6484 not opportunity. So he went out and tried to make a play for manufacturing. That's been
###6488 the center point of my campaign. The center point of my campaign is to be able to win
###6491 the industrial heartland, get those Reagan Democrats back, talking about manufacturing,
###6496 talking about building that ladder of success all the way down so people can climb all the
###6500 way up. That's why I'm the best person to be able to go out and win the states that
###6505 are necessary to win this presidency and govern with the mandate that Newt just talked about.
###6510 >> BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.
###6510 >> [APPLAUSE]
###6511 >> BLITZER: And thank you to the four presidential candidates.
###6515 >> [APPLAUSE]
###6515 >> BLITZER: I also want to thank our partners in this debate, the Republican Party of Florida,
###6520 the Hispanic Leadership Network. Thank you very much to them.
###6525 >> [APPLAUSE]
###6526 >> BLITZER: We'd also like to thank our hosts here on the campus of the University of North
###6538 Florida in Jacksonville.
