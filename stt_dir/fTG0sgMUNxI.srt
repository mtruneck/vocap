2
0:4:22,87 --> 0:4:25,706
Thank you. Tickets.


3
0:4:25,706 --> 0:4:28,209
Is it far to Tucumcari?


4
0:4:28,209 --> 0:4:30,42
We should pass there
in about three or four minutes.


5
0:4:30,42 --> 0:4:31,796
Thanks.


6
0:4:31,796 --> 0:4:35,216
Excuse me, but you've
made a mistake, Reverend.


7
0:4:35,216 --> 0:4:37,76
I couldn't help hearing
you're going to Tucumcari.


8
0:4:37,76 --> 0:4:45,226
I peddle goods around here, and I better
tell you you're on the wrong train.


9
0:4:45,226 --> 0:4:48,62
I think the nearest stop
to Tucumcari is Amarillo.


10
0:4:48,62 --> 0:4:51,441
By getting off at Sante Fe
and returning by way of Amarillo...


11
0:4:51,441 --> 0:4:57,614
you should be able to get
right where you're going.


12
0:4:57,614 --> 0:5:12,45
You see, the train
doesn't stop at Tucumcari.


13
0:5:12,45 --> 0:5:40,156
This train'll stop at Tucumcari.


14
0:5:40,156 --> 0:5:43,34
Take it easy, everybody!


15
0:5:43,34 --> 0:5:45,412
Why'd you stop?
Something gone wrong?


16
0:5:45,412 --> 0:5:57,966
Somebody pulled the emergency cord.


17
0:5:57,966 --> 0:6:1,678
Hey, mister, you just can't pull
the emergency cord and jump off.


18
0:6:1,678 --> 0:6:5,765
Why'd you stop that train?
lf you want to get off, you--


19
0:6:5,765 --> 0:6:9,352
Well, the railroad company'd be mighty
pleased to make any arrangements...


20
0:6:9,352 --> 0:6:12,564
for any passenger if you want
to get off here, sir.


21
0:6:12,564 --> 0:6:17,861
I did get off. Thanks.


22
0:6:17,861 --> 0:6:54,773
All right, let's go!
Go ahead!


23
0:6:54,773 --> 0:6:58,61
Guy passed by here in person
and added on those two zeros.


24
0:6:58,61 --> 0:7:2,281
He was spittin' mad when he saw what
they was offerin'. He wasn't flattered.


25
0:7:2,281 --> 0:7:5,534
He said, "A measly thousand bucks
for me is much too little.


26
0:7:5,534 --> 0:7:8,454
I'm worth a lot more than that."


27
0:7:8,454 --> 0:7:13,292
He said that, and then he added
the zeros on the thousand.


28
0:7:13,292 --> 0:7:24,386
There isn't anyone got the guts
to face that killer, eh?


29
0:7:24,386 --> 0:7:26,388
At least...


30
0:7:26,388 --> 0:8:9,473
it's been that way till now.


31
0:8:9,473 --> 0:8:26,282
Where is he?


32
0:8:26,282 --> 0:8:36,584
Where is he?


33
0:8:36,584 --> 0:9:1,234
I have no idea
where he'd be today.


34
0:9:1,234 --> 0:9:3,236
- Hold still.
- But Guy--


35
0:9:3,236 --> 0:9:6,239
- Hold still, I said.
- You hurt me with those hands of yours.


36
0:9:6,239 --> 0:9:9,33
- Then do as I tell ya.
- Stop it!


37
0:9:9,33 --> 0:9:13,162
Now see, you've made me drop the soap.


38
0:9:13,162 --> 0:9:18,918
- Wait, I'll get it for ya.
- You're killing me.


39
0:9:18,918 --> 0:10:3,254
Oh, look. What's that?


40
0:10:3,254 --> 0:11:36,515
Pardon me, ma'am.


41
0:11:36,515 --> 0:11:50,7
I'll kill you for this.


42
0:11:50,7 --> 0:12:3,208
There you are.
A thousand dollars.


43
0:12:3,208 --> 0:12:5,502
What do you know about Cavanagh?


44
0:12:5,502 --> 0:12:8,589
About a week ago
he was seen at White Rocks.


45
0:12:8,589 --> 0:12:10,841
Thanks.


46
0:12:10,841 --> 0:12:13,177
If it's of any interest to ya...


47
0:12:13,177 --> 0:12:16,764
somebody else dropped in
to see me about him.


48
0:12:16,764 --> 0:12:18,14
Who?


49
0:12:18,14 --> 0:12:20,976
I'd never seen him before.


50
0:12:20,976 --> 0:13:47,814
His name is Monco.


51
0:13:47,814 --> 0:13:51,943
Light?


52
0:13:51,943 --> 0:13:57,49
You know Baby Cavanagh?


53
0:13:57,49 --> 0:14:7,166
Now tell me,
you know where I can find him?


54
0:14:7,166 --> 0:14:10,253
There, at that table.


55
0:14:10,253 --> 0:14:15,884
He's got his back to ya.


56
0:14:15,884 --> 0:15:23,16
Thanks.


57
0:15:23,16 --> 0:16:4,952
Two cards.


58
0:16:4,952 --> 0:16:10,332
Didn't hear what the bet was.


59
0:16:10,332 --> 0:16:40,946
Your life.


60
0:16:40,946 --> 0:16:46,827
Alive or dead--
it's your choice.


61
0:16:46,827 --> 0:17:26,325
Let Red go.


62
0:17:26,325 --> 0:17:29,245
Two thousand dollars.
It's a lot of money.


63
0:17:29,245 --> 0:17:31,622
Takes me three years to earn it.


64
0:17:31,622 --> 0:17:35,876
Tell me, isn't a sheriff
supposed to be courageous, loyal...


65
0:17:35,876 --> 0:17:38,838
and above all, honest?


66
0:17:38,838 --> 0:17:53,644
Yeah, that he is.


67
0:17:53,644 --> 0:20:56,787
I think you people
need a new sheriff.


68
0:20:56,787 --> 0:21:34,95
Hughie.


69
0:21:34,95 --> 0:21:36,952
How are you, Nino?


70
0:21:36,952 --> 0:21:52,51
Better when I see you.


71
0:21:52,51 --> 0:22:16,33
Go on. Go ahead.


72
0:22:16,33 --> 0:22:36,387
Open it.


73
0:22:36,387 --> 0:23:11,673
- What's up? Who is it?
- Rodriguez, senor.


74
0:23:11,673 --> 0:23:29,566
You. Come along.


75
0:23:29,566 --> 0:23:31,568
I'm letting you live, hero.


76
0:23:31,568 --> 0:24:30,544
That's so you can tell everybody
you've seen what takes place here.


77
0:24:30,544 --> 0:24:40,679
For the lousy money.


78
0:24:40,679 --> 0:24:46,184
You took money
to put me behind bars.


79
0:24:46,184 --> 0:24:48,937
You should've killed me
when you could.


80
0:24:48,937 --> 0:24:52,232
It would be better for you.


81
0:24:52,232 --> 0:24:57,487
And for them.


82
0:24:57,487 --> 0:25:3,243
How old's the boy?


83
0:25:3,243 --> 0:25:6,413
How old is the boy, I asked?


84
0:25:6,413 --> 0:25:9,625
He's 18 months now.


85
0:25:9,625 --> 0:25:15,13
Just the time that I was in jail.


86
0:25:15,13 --> 0:25:17,466
You used the reward that you got...


87
0:25:17,466 --> 0:25:21,553
to start raising a family.


88
0:25:21,553 --> 0:25:26,517
And that's why I feel
your family is partly mine.


89
0:25:26,517 --> 0:25:28,977
I'll take my part now.


90
0:25:28,977 --> 0:25:34,399
Outside.


91
0:25:34,399 --> 0:26:6,724
They're both innocent. Please let them
go! I was the one. You know that.


92
0:26:6,724 --> 0:26:33,542
I know.
I'm sure you hate me just enough.


93
0:26:33,542 --> 0:26:39,84
This time you'll have a chance
to shoot me, but not in the back.


94
0:26:39,84 --> 0:26:47,515
Let go.


95
0:26:47,515 --> 0:26:51,435
When you hear the music finish, begin.


96
0:26:51,435 --> 0:26:56,899
Or do you think you can?


97
0:26:56,899 --> 0:28:55,101
Let's start.


98
0:28:55,101 --> 0:29:35,809
Now.


99
0:29:35,809 --> 0:29:41,69
- Check those figures again.
- Yes, sir.


100
0:29:41,69 --> 0:29:44,67
Good day, sir. Good afternoon.


101
0:29:44,67 --> 0:29:46,778
Mortimer.


102
0:29:46,778 --> 0:29:49,907
- Douglas Mortimer.
- Mortimer. Virginia, isn't it?


103
0:29:49,907 --> 0:29:52,701
- Carolina.
- That's right, Carolina.


104
0:29:52,701 --> 0:29:55,37
Can I help in some way?


105
0:29:55,37 --> 0:29:59,41
- I'm looking for a first-class bank.
- Oh, but exactly.


106
0:29:59,41 --> 0:30:0,584
Yeah.


107
0:30:0,584 --> 0:30:4,46
The largest and most secure bank
in the territory.


108
0:30:4,46 --> 0:30:6,924
Well, Mr. Mortimer,
I want to assure you our bank here...


109
0:30:6,924 --> 0:30:9,676
has everything--
all the safeguards you're looking for.


110
0:30:9,676 --> 0:30:13,13
I don't doubt that, but I have
a large sum to deposit.


111
0:30:13,13 --> 0:30:17,935
Now, suppose I'm a bandit.


112
0:30:17,935 --> 0:30:19,978
A bandit?


113
0:30:19,978 --> 0:30:23,65
A very dangerous bandit
with a gang of killers.


114
0:30:23,65 --> 0:30:27,82
What would be the most
impossible bank for me to rob?


115
0:30:27,82 --> 0:30:31,532
In your case, the one bank
I would suggest is the Bank of EI Paso.


116
0:30:31,532 --> 0:30:33,784
Not even lndio would dare
to attack that one.


117
0:30:33,784 --> 0:30:41,417
It's not a bank.
It's a fortress there.


118
0:30:41,417 --> 0:30:43,836
What time's the next train
for EI Paso?


119
0:30:43,836 --> 0:30:46,38
11:30. I'll telegraph
to my colleague...


120
0:30:46,38 --> 0:30:48,757
in the Bank of EI Paso
that you're going to arrive.


121
0:30:48,757 --> 0:31:15,868
Thanks.


122
0:31:15,868 --> 0:31:18,662
Hey, mister. Captain.
General. Welcome.


123
0:31:18,662 --> 0:31:22,41
Do you need a stable or a room?
Do you want to take a bath?


124
0:31:22,41 --> 0:31:24,877
My name is Fernando.
The stable is right here.


125
0:31:24,877 --> 0:31:27,755
And that is your hotel.


126
0:31:27,755 --> 0:31:30,424
Why this hotel
and not some other?


127
0:31:30,424 --> 0:31:33,135
You probably wouldn't like
that other place as much, senor.


128
0:31:33,135 --> 0:31:36,472
You'd have to spend half the night
shootin' cockroaches.


129
0:31:36,472 --> 0:31:38,933
At this hotel, the rooms
will cost you so much less.


130
0:31:38,933 --> 0:31:42,52
And there's a landlady
at this one, senor.


131
0:31:42,52 --> 0:32:3,875
- Married?
- Yes, but she doesn't care.


132
0:32:3,875 --> 0:32:7,211
That's the bank. As soon as I get
some money, I'll put it in.


133
0:32:7,211 --> 0:32:11,424
Well, you're gonna have
to earn it first.


134
0:32:11,424 --> 0:32:13,968
I have 50 cents here for you
if you'll let me know...


135
0:32:13,968 --> 0:32:18,556
when anybody you've never seen before
here in EI Paso comes to town.


136
0:32:18,556 --> 0:32:28,9
At the hotel, senor.
A stranger just came outta there.


137
0:32:28,9 --> 0:32:39,911
Where's he staying?


138
0:32:39,911 --> 0:32:45,542
The hotel.


139
0:32:45,542 --> 0:32:48,253
Let me know if you see
any more strangers.


140
0:32:48,253 --> 0:33:5,729
Sure, senor.


141
0:33:5,729 --> 0:33:9,107
- Help you, sir?
- I want the room right above.


142
0:33:9,107 --> 0:33:12,485
I'm sorry, it's occupied.
It's too bad.


143
0:33:12,485 --> 0:33:15,405
The hotel's filled to capacity.
I'm sorry.


144
0:33:15,405 --> 0:33:18,533
The room you want is our best.
It's always occupied.


145
0:33:18,533 --> 0:33:20,785
By who?


146
0:33:20,785 --> 0:33:22,579
Check the register.


147
0:33:22,579 --> 0:33:25,832
Mary!


148
0:33:25,832 --> 0:33:36,676
It's Senor Martinez.


149
0:33:36,676 --> 0:33:41,264
- It's free now.
- That room is taken!


150
0:33:41,264 --> 0:33:48,396
I'll see to it.


151
0:33:48,396 --> 0:33:51,691
He's nothing but a wild,
vicious animal!


152
0:33:51,691 --> 0:33:57,739
He's tall, isn't he?


153
0:33:57,739 --> 0:34:11,962
You're just dirty!


154
0:34:11,962 --> 0:34:14,798
Proprietor, quick! My bill!


155
0:34:14,798 --> 0:34:18,927
I want my bill!


156
0:34:18,927 --> 0:34:22,97
- Before he comes down, give me my bill.
- There's no need to check out.


157
0:34:22,97 --> 0:34:25,392
Everything's gonna be all right.
I'll give you another room immediately.


158
0:34:25,392 --> 0:34:28,687
It's the best in the whole hotel.
We'll let him have the bridal suite.


159
0:34:28,687 --> 0:34:31,148
No, Mary, the bill.
I'd like to stay, only I can't.


160
0:34:31,148 --> 0:34:38,197
- Don't go, Mr. Martinez.
- I have an appointment elsewhere.


161
0:34:38,197 --> 0:34:46,246
Yes, senor, what do you want?


162
0:34:46,246 --> 0:34:48,248
I don't wear 'em.


163
0:34:48,248 --> 0:35:30,124
I'm honored that you thought of me.
Thank you.


164
0:35:30,124 --> 0:35:56,609
Watch this.


165
0:35:56,609 --> 0:35:59,82
Hello, my friends.


166
0:35:59,82 --> 0:36:1,697
Hello, lndio.


167
0:36:1,697 --> 0:36:4,742
You see, I didn't waste
a minute coming here.


168
0:36:4,742 --> 0:36:7,703
Indio calls and Groggy
comes running right away.


169
0:36:7,703 --> 0:36:9,246
And Sancho?


170
0:36:9,246 --> 0:36:13,167
If you're waiting for Sancho, I'll go
and come back in about four years.


171
0:36:13,167 --> 0:36:23,177
He's in prison for four years.


172
0:36:23,177 --> 0:36:26,806
Bad for him.
Not so bad for the rest of us.


173
0:36:26,806 --> 0:36:32,27
A man who gets caught
doesn't deserve respect, huh?


174
0:36:32,27 --> 0:36:34,522
What's it all about, huh?


175
0:36:34,522 --> 0:36:40,445
Now just listen.


176
0:36:40,445 --> 0:36:43,948
A bank at EI Paso.


177
0:36:43,948 --> 0:36:45,366
Let's see.


178
0:36:45,366 --> 0:36:50,496
We'll say this is the inside
of the bank. Nino is the safe.


179
0:36:50,496 --> 0:36:55,126
Which weighs three tons
and can't be opened with dynamite.


180
0:36:55,126 --> 0:36:58,379
There's the part with two cashiers.


181
0:36:58,379 --> 0:37:1,9
This is the manager's desk.


182
0:37:1,9 --> 0:37:3,926
Right in back is a fancy cabinet
containing bottles...


183
0:37:3,926 --> 0:37:8,473
for offering drinks
to the rich depositors.


184
0:37:8,473 --> 0:37:12,602
There's the main door, and opposite
they built a double wall.


185
0:37:12,602 --> 0:37:14,646
What happens, Groggy?


186
0:37:14,646 --> 0:37:18,733
Let's say you've already killed
the two cashiers and the manager.


187
0:37:18,733 --> 0:37:22,737
For the next few minutes,
you're the boss of the bank.


188
0:37:22,737 --> 0:37:25,698
Now what?


189
0:37:25,698 --> 0:37:29,577
The time's been wasted.


190
0:37:29,577 --> 0:37:33,373
Right, a waste of time.
Especially, Groggy, to blast open...


191
0:37:33,373 --> 0:37:37,168
that damn iron safe, we'd have
to be using so much dynamite...


192
0:37:37,168 --> 0:37:40,171
that the whole bank
would just disappear.


193
0:37:40,171 --> 0:37:43,258
And you'd all go up with it.


194
0:37:43,258 --> 0:37:48,54
Besides, the presence of a safe alone
doesn't always signify...


195
0:37:48,54 --> 0:37:51,599
that there is money inside.


196
0:37:51,599 --> 0:37:55,812
To help you understand what I mean...


197
0:37:55,812 --> 0:38:2,902
I would like to relate
a nice little parable.


198
0:38:2,902 --> 0:38:7,949
Once upon a time
there was a carpenter.


199
0:38:7,949 --> 0:38:11,203
You don't think a carpenter
can make money, eh?


200
0:38:11,203 --> 0:38:14,748
No? You're wrong.


201
0:38:14,748 --> 0:38:20,754
This one did well because
he was a builder of safes.


202
0:38:20,754 --> 0:38:22,964
There was a banker once...


203
0:38:22,964 --> 0:38:25,717
who decided he must have
his iron safe disguised...


204
0:38:25,717 --> 0:38:32,432
to look like a wood cabinet.


205
0:38:32,432 --> 0:38:34,434
To get it made...


206
0:38:34,434 --> 0:38:40,107
the banker goes to our carpenter
for the job, and one day...


207
0:38:40,107 --> 0:38:42,317
as destiny has it...


208
0:38:42,317 --> 0:38:44,945
the carpenter's in EI Paso.


209
0:38:44,945 --> 0:38:49,157
He happens to walk into the bank there,
and what does he find?


210
0:38:49,157 --> 0:38:51,451
The cabinet.


211
0:38:51,451 --> 0:38:55,33
Since he'd worked on the cabinet,
he spotted it right away.


212
0:38:55,33 --> 0:38:58,208
From that day on,
he couldn't work anymore.


213
0:38:58,208 --> 0:39:1,336
Pity, because...


214
0:39:1,336 --> 0:39:4,214
there was something he had to do.


215
0:39:4,214 --> 0:39:7,92
There was this crazy idea.


216
0:39:7,92 --> 0:39:13,14
And it stayed--


217
0:39:13,14 --> 0:39:15,976
to put his hands on the money inside.


218
0:39:15,976 --> 0:39:19,646
Get in there and grab all the money.


219
0:39:19,646 --> 0:39:23,609
Sure, you think that carpenter
was lucky the way things work out--


220
0:39:23,609 --> 0:39:26,111
that he was lucky
to go in just that bank.


221
0:39:26,111 --> 0:39:30,74
It wasn't true.


222
0:39:30,74 --> 0:39:32,326
His good fortune stopped that day.


223
0:39:32,326 --> 0:39:34,787
Because later...


224
0:39:34,787 --> 0:39:39,458
as a prisoner...


225
0:39:39,458 --> 0:39:46,34
he ran into me.


226
0:39:46,34 --> 0:39:56,267
The carpenter told me the story,
and I tell you.


227
0:39:56,267 --> 0:40:2,189
The money isn't in the safe.
It's right in this!


228
0:40:2,189 --> 0:40:7,528
Almost a million dollars in it.


229
0:40:7,528 --> 0:40:10,197
Your colleague in Tucumcari told me
that this bank...


230
0:40:10,197 --> 0:40:13,409
has the largest deposits
in the whole state.


231
0:40:13,409 --> 0:40:15,619
Yes, that's correct,
Mr. Mortimer.


232
0:40:15,619 --> 0:40:22,835
Here at the bank at EI Paso we have half
a million dollars in reserve on hand.


233
0:40:22,835 --> 0:40:26,756
I see. You sure this bank
is secure enough to hold that much?


234
0:40:26,756 --> 0:40:29,675
From the moment your money's
on deposit here...


235
0:40:29,675 --> 0:40:34,764
you can sleep without any worries.


236
0:40:34,764 --> 0:40:37,183
Besides...


237
0:40:37,183 --> 0:40:39,977
when the bank is closed,
an armed guard always remains here...


238
0:40:39,977 --> 0:40:42,647
and a patrol
is on guard outside.


239
0:40:42,647 --> 0:40:46,734
Even the Bank of San Francisco
isn't that well protected.


240
0:40:46,734 --> 0:40:51,656
Exactly. The truth is...


241
0:40:51,656 --> 0:40:53,824
to try robbing us
would be so futile...


242
0:40:53,824 --> 0:40:57,286
that only a complete fool
would attempt it.


243
0:40:57,286 --> 0:40:59,455
Yeah.


244
0:40:59,455 --> 0:41:12,218
Or a complete madman.


245
0:41:12,218 --> 0:42:0,35
Get out of the way!
Get out of here!


246
0:42:0,35 --> 0:42:4,562
More news, amigo.


247
0:42:4,562 --> 0:42:7,357
Another stranger in town?


248
0:42:7,357 --> 0:42:15,74
Yes. And I know something else.


249
0:42:15,74 --> 0:42:19,369
There was another stranger
I didn't tell you about.


250
0:42:19,369 --> 0:42:22,414
Listen to me,
you sawed-off little runt!


251
0:42:22,414 --> 0:42:25,0
I want to know how many men
there are all together.


252
0:42:25,0 --> 0:42:27,419
Well, there were two.
Now there's two more.


253
0:42:27,419 --> 0:42:29,879
Where?


254
0:42:29,879 --> 0:44:42,96
In the saloon.


255
0:44:42,96 --> 0:44:43,514
Whiskey.


256
0:44:43,514 --> 0:44:46,767
Listen, mister, why do you choose
my place to commit suicide?


257
0:44:46,767 --> 0:44:50,271
I know that man.
It's a miracle you're alive.


258
0:44:50,271 --> 0:44:53,941
Why should a man walk around with
a pistol and let himself be insulted?


259
0:44:53,941 --> 0:44:55,943
It's mighty strange.


260
0:44:55,943 --> 0:44:57,987
If the hunchback didn't shoot you...


261
0:44:57,987 --> 0:45:3,2
he had a very important reason,
that's all.


262
0:45:3,2 --> 0:46:5,179
I was thinking that myself.


263
0:46:5,179 --> 0:46:7,849
1, 2...


264
0:46:7,849 --> 0:46:20,32
3, now 4, now 5...


265
0:46:20,32 --> 0:46:23,74
11, 12, 13...


266
0:46:23,74 --> 0:46:27,327
14, 15, 16...


267
0:46:27,327 --> 0:46:31,748
17, 18, 19...


268
0:46:31,748 --> 0:46:36,44
20, 21, 22...


269
0:46:36,44 --> 0:46:39,13
23, 24...


270
0:46:39,13 --> 0:46:42,8
25, 26...


271
0:46:42,8 --> 0:46:47,18
27, 28, 29...


272
0:46:47,18 --> 0:46:50,1
30, 31...


273
0:46:50,1 --> 0:48:38,5
32 and 33.


274
0:48:38,5 --> 0:48:42,4
All right, now.


275
0:48:42,4 --> 0:48:44,757
I don't know him!


276
0:48:44,757 --> 0:48:46,759
Come on, now, you know everybody.


277
0:48:46,759 --> 0:48:50,637
I don't know anybody anymore!
I'm dead! Understand?


278
0:48:50,637 --> 0:48:53,14
Well, there was a time
when I knew everybody.


279
0:48:53,14 --> 0:48:56,6
That was a long time ago
when all this was prairie.


280
0:48:56,6 --> 0:48:58,562
In these days everybody's in a hurry.
That's right...


281
0:48:58,562 --> 0:49:4,526
with your damned
good-for-nothing trains!


282
0:49:4,526 --> 0:49:6,7
Disgusting!


283
0:49:6,7 --> 0:49:8,447
One day, someone from the railroad
comes here to see me.


284
0:49:8,447 --> 0:49:12,243
He says, "Prophet, the railway's
gonna go right past your house."


285
0:49:12,243 --> 0:49:15,246
"Is that so?" I said.


286
0:49:15,246 --> 0:49:17,665
"Yep, that right," he says.


287
0:49:17,665 --> 0:49:19,959
"All those trains
gonna go right past here.


288
0:49:19,959 --> 0:49:22,336
The best thing for you, Prophet,
is sell your land to the company...


289
0:49:22,336 --> 0:49:24,13
or else we'll buy Baker's.


290
0:49:24,13 --> 0:49:27,7
He lives next to your place,
and I'll put the tracks here...


291
0:49:27,7 --> 0:49:29,176
and that'll make you go crazy.


292
0:49:29,176 --> 0:49:31,429
Will you sell out
to our company, Prophet?"


293
0:49:31,429 --> 0:49:35,766
"Oh, is that so?" says l.


294
0:49:35,766 --> 0:49:38,227
He was very anxious
for me to sell out.


295
0:49:38,227 --> 0:49:40,604
You know what I told him
about the railroad?


296
0:49:40,604 --> 0:50:2,501
You know what I told him
he could do with his railroad?


297
0:50:2,501 --> 0:50:5,254
You know what my decision
about selling was?


298
0:50:5,254 --> 0:50:7,256
Well, you said no.


299
0:50:7,256 --> 0:50:10,76
You're right about that.
No to him and his damn trains!


300
0:50:10,76 --> 0:50:12,762
I wouldn't! No!


301
0:50:12,762 --> 0:50:15,765
Look, listen to me, old man.


302
0:50:15,765 --> 0:50:17,767
You're supposed to be a prophet.


303
0:50:17,767 --> 0:50:20,686
I didn't come here to listen to you
rattle on about trains.


304
0:50:20,686 --> 0:50:24,107
I want to find out about this man.
It's obvious you don't know anything.


305
0:50:24,107 --> 0:50:26,943
No need to be insulting.
If that's all you came here to do...


306
0:50:26,943 --> 0:50:29,987
you can clear out of my house fast
before I lose my temper.


307
0:50:29,987 --> 0:50:35,702
Understand?


308
0:50:35,702 --> 0:50:40,915
Hey! Where you goin'?


309
0:50:40,915 --> 0:50:44,794
I guess I better leave before
you go and lose your temper.


310
0:50:44,794 --> 0:50:47,171
What's the matter with you?
Why are you so dang stupid?


311
0:50:47,171 --> 0:50:49,173
Hurry up,
give me that pistol there.


312
0:50:49,173 --> 0:50:51,676
Yeah, right there behind ya.


313
0:50:51,676 --> 0:50:53,72
Hurry!


314
0:50:53,72 --> 0:50:57,14
Yes, that's the one.
Now, hand it over.


315
0:50:57,14 --> 0:51:0,894
That's it. Give me that gun.
The man you asked about.


316
0:51:0,894 --> 0:51:3,938
There's only one question:
How does he carry his gun?


317
0:51:3,938 --> 0:51:6,232
He wears it here,
across his belly?


318
0:51:6,232 --> 0:51:9,777
Well, why didn't you tell me that
in the first place, my boy.


319
0:51:9,777 --> 0:51:12,322
Of course I know the man
you're trying to find out about.


320
0:51:12,322 --> 0:51:14,324
Of course I know him.


321
0:51:14,324 --> 0:51:17,243
He's Colonel Douglas Mortimer.


322
0:51:17,243 --> 0:51:20,955
Mortimer-- a brave man, a soldier.


323
0:51:20,955 --> 0:51:23,5
He was known as the best shot
in the Carolinas.


324
0:51:23,5 --> 0:51:25,21
A great soldier.


325
0:51:25,21 --> 0:51:29,172
Now he's reduced to being
a bounty killer, same as you.


326
0:51:29,172 --> 0:51:31,49
Because of trains!


327
0:51:31,49 --> 0:53:0,764
Because of the damn trains!
Damn 'em!


328
0:53:0,764 --> 0:53:9,314
Take it to the station.
The gentleman's leavin'.


329
0:53:9,314 --> 0:53:13,68
Hold it.


330
0:53:13,68 --> 0:53:17,781
Take it back.


331
0:53:17,781 --> 0:53:21,994
Take it to the station.


332
0:53:21,994 --> 0:54:33,858
- Go inside.
- The station!


333
0:54:33,858 --> 0:55:31,708
Just like the games we know.


334
0:55:31,708 --> 0:57:19,775
- He's picking it up.
- A trick, maybe.


335
0:57:19,775 --> 0:57:25,239
How can somebody in my business
go around with a contraption like this?


336
0:57:25,239 --> 0:57:28,492
That contraption...


337
0:57:28,492 --> 0:57:32,663
almost sent you to your grave.


338
0:57:32,663 --> 0:57:35,916
You're forgetting one thing, Colonel--
I was shooting at your hat.


339
0:57:35,916 --> 0:57:39,253
Well, I was only shooting at yours.


340
0:57:39,253 --> 0:57:43,507
But I recall firing first.


341
0:57:43,507 --> 0:57:45,384
Boy...


342
0:57:45,384 --> 0:57:48,679
I've reached almost 50 years
of age with my system.


343
0:57:48,679 --> 0:57:51,56
Not many men last long
in these parts.


344
0:57:51,56 --> 0:57:55,6
How long do you expect to last?


345
0:57:55,6 --> 0:57:57,771
Much longer than that.


346
0:57:57,771 --> 0:58:1,692
When I get my hands on lndio
and that $10,000...


347
0:58:1,692 --> 0:58:6,655
I'm gonna buy myself a little place,
possibly retire.


348
0:58:6,655 --> 0:58:9,616
Well, I don't believe we ought
to start another fight.


349
0:58:9,616 --> 0:58:11,744
But you forget one small detail.


350
0:58:11,744 --> 0:58:13,37
What's that?


351
0:58:13,37 --> 0:58:15,706
I wanna get my hands on lndio too.


352
0:58:15,706 --> 0:58:19,793
Sure, after me.


353
0:58:19,793 --> 0:58:22,171
Or before you.


354
0:58:22,171 --> 0:58:27,218
Or at the same time.


355
0:58:27,218 --> 0:58:30,262
Is that a proposition?


356
0:58:30,262 --> 0:58:32,932
An equal partnership.


357
0:58:32,932 --> 0:58:34,892
Why? Why should l?


358
0:58:34,892 --> 0:58:36,894
I can think of three reasons.


359
0:58:36,894 --> 0:58:39,63
First is there's 14 of them.


360
0:58:39,63 --> 0:58:41,65
Yeah, that's a lot.


361
0:58:41,65 --> 0:58:42,733
A lot for me.


362
0:58:42,733 --> 0:58:45,319
Yeah. No small number
even for two of us.


363
0:58:45,319 --> 0:58:48,155
Second reason?


364
0:58:48,155 --> 0:58:52,743
Second reason--


365
0:58:52,743 --> 0:58:55,454
The second reason is
you could make it 15 to one.


366
0:58:55,454 --> 0:58:57,999
Don't forget I wanna play
in this game too.


367
0:58:57,999 --> 0:59:2,461
As you're aware, when two hunters
go after the same prey...


368
0:59:2,461 --> 0:59:10,261
they usually end up shooting each other
in the back, and we don't want that.


369
0:59:10,261 --> 0:59:14,807
Then the colonel dies, hmm?


370
0:59:14,807 --> 0:59:18,394
All right, I'll be generous.


371
0:59:18,394 --> 0:59:21,105
You can have the reward
for lndio...


372
0:59:21,105 --> 0:59:26,652
and I'll take the reward
for the rest of the band.


373
0:59:26,652 --> 0:59:28,779
All wrong.


374
0:59:28,779 --> 0:59:33,367
Indio's worth $10,000 dollars, but
the rest adds up to much more than that.


375
0:59:33,367 --> 0:59:36,996
Blackie's worth four,
Wild's worth three, Nino two.


376
0:59:36,996 --> 0:59:41,334
Nino's one.


377
0:59:41,334 --> 0:59:43,795
Well, Frisco's worth two.


378
0:59:43,795 --> 0:59:46,339
That's ten thousand.


379
0:59:46,339 --> 0:59:48,299
Yeah, but...


380
0:59:48,299 --> 0:59:51,594
there's a few more that'll
add up to more than that, I'm sure.


381
0:59:51,594 --> 0:59:54,972
- How do you know that?
- I have my information.


382
0:59:54,972 --> 0:59:56,975
When all's said and done...


383
0:59:56,975 --> 1:0:3,189
I think I might just take you up
on your proposition.


384
1:0:3,189 --> 1:0:9,237
Let's drink to this partnership.


385
1:0:9,237 --> 1:0:13,616
To the partnership,
with no tricks, of course.


386
1:0:13,616 --> 1:0:19,372
No tricks.


387
1:0:19,372 --> 1:0:20,832
Now, then...


388
1:0:20,832 --> 1:0:28,214
you realize we're gonna have to figure
out some way to get them in the middle.


389
1:0:28,214 --> 1:0:32,177
One from the outside, one from
the inside. There's no other way.


390
1:0:32,177 --> 1:0:37,807
One of us will have to
join lndio's band.


391
1:0:37,807 --> 1:0:40,393
Why are you looking at me
when you say "one of us"?


392
1:0:40,393 --> 1:0:42,145
Because they don't know you.


393
1:0:42,145 --> 1:0:47,65
Wild sees me and his hump
will catch on fire.


394
1:0:47,65 --> 1:0:49,277
Tell me...


395
1:0:49,277 --> 1:0:52,489
how do you propose that I
join up with lndio?


396
1:0:52,489 --> 1:0:55,533
Maybe bring him
a bunch of roses?


397
1:0:55,533 --> 1:1:0,38
You could do that, but I'd suggest
you take him Sancho Perez.


398
1:1:0,38 --> 1:1:2,415
Who's Sancho Perez?


399
1:1:2,415 --> 1:1:5,377
A friend of lndio's.
Right now he's cooling off.


400
1:1:5,377 --> 1:1:8,129
He's cooling off
in Alamogourdo jail.


401
1:1:8,129 --> 1:1:11,883
How do you know all this?


402
1:1:11,883 --> 1:1:16,221
I've got my information too.


403
1:1:16,221 --> 1:1:23,19
Naturally, you'll have to arrange
for his, uh, release.


404
1:1:23,19 --> 1:1:26,314
Naturally.


405
1:1:26,314 --> 1:1:28,358
Tell me...


406
1:1:28,358 --> 1:1:34,448
were you ever young?


407
1:1:34,448 --> 1:1:40,37
And just as reckless as you.


408
1:1:40,37 --> 1:1:43,4
Then one day something happened.


409
1:1:43,4 --> 1:1:44,875
Made life very precious to me.


410
1:1:44,875 --> 1:1:52,424
What's that?


411
1:1:52,424 --> 1:1:57,888
Or is the question indiscreet?


412
1:1:57,888 --> 1:2:1,308
The question isn't indiscreet.


413
1:2:1,308 --> 1:5:17,672
But the answer could be.


414
1:5:17,672 --> 1:5:24,512
They told me you were put away. You'd be
resting for four long years in prison.


415
1:5:24,512 --> 1:5:40,7
No, lndio, for four weeks.
No more than four weeks.


416
1:5:40,7 --> 1:5:41,988
Who is that with you?


417
1:5:41,988 --> 1:5:52,666
He got me out.
The man's a friend of mine.


418
1:5:52,666 --> 1:5:57,254
Why did he help you?
Did you ask him that?


419
1:5:57,254 --> 1:6:2,592
Yeah. Amigo, why did you
help me out?


420
1:6:2,592 --> 1:6:7,806
Well, there's such a big reward
being offered on all you gentlemen...


421
1:6:7,806 --> 1:6:12,227
that I thought I might just tag along
on your next robbery.


422
1:6:12,227 --> 1:6:57,22
I might just turn you
into the law.


423
1:6:57,22 --> 1:7:0,275
Amigo...


424
1:7:0,275 --> 1:7:5,697
that's the one answer
that would prove you're all right.


425
1:7:5,697 --> 1:7:10,202
And you arrived just in time too.
The job is already set.


426
1:7:10,202 --> 1:7:12,871
It's tomorrow.


427
1:7:12,871 --> 1:7:15,4
The place is...


428
1:7:15,4 --> 1:7:19,795
the bank in EI Paso.


429
1:7:19,795 --> 1:7:23,48
Not far from EI Paso
there's a little town, Santa Cruz.


430
1:7:23,48 --> 1:7:26,635
Tomorrow, Blackie, Chico,
Paco...


431
1:7:26,635 --> 1:7:29,888
and you, amigo...


432
1:7:29,888 --> 1:7:32,516
will rob the bank in Santa Cruz.


433
1:7:32,516 --> 1:7:35,769
Shoot, kill, get every gun
in the area after you...


434
1:7:35,769 --> 1:7:37,771
especially those from EI Paso.


435
1:7:37,771 --> 1:7:42,985
Any others around,
we'll take care of them.


436
1:7:42,985 --> 1:7:50,451
And then after the job,
we'll all meet again at Las Palmeras.


437
1:7:50,451 --> 1:7:58,709
Where are you going?


438
1:7:58,709 --> 1:8:2,588
Well, if there's gonna be
any shooting...


439
1:8:2,588 --> 1:8:21,649
I gotta get my rest.


440
1:8:21,649 --> 1:8:26,362
Hey, amigo, you know when you told
that story yesterday, I fell for it.


441
1:8:26,362 --> 1:8:37,999
Big joke, wasn't it, amigo?


442
1:8:37,999 --> 1:8:42,128
Who said I was jokin'?


443
1:8:42,128 --> 1:8:44,13
I don't get that.
If it's true--


444
1:8:44,13 --> 1:8:50,762
Too bad you have to die.


445
1:8:50,762 --> 1:9:48,69
What is it?


446
1:9:48,69 --> 1:10:33,365
By now they should be
at Santa Cruz.


447
1:10:33,365 --> 1:10:38,453
Listen, shorty...


448
1:10:38,453 --> 1:10:42,332
Indio and his band have just
robbed the bank here in town.


449
1:10:42,332 --> 1:10:45,836
Now why don't you just sit down
and send out the alarm to EI Paso...


450
1:10:45,836 --> 1:10:48,797
and the rest of the towns around here
and warn 'em, right?


451
1:10:48,797 --> 1:10:52,509
But, mister, I didn't hear any shots
at the bank, and I sure would have.


452
1:10:52,509 --> 1:10:54,511
You might hear one.


453
1:10:54,511 --> 1:11:39,681
The alarm.


454
1:11:39,681 --> 1:11:41,767
Easy now.


455
1:11:41,767 --> 1:11:46,105
They've robbed the bank
at Santa Cruz!


456
1:11:46,105 --> 1:13:26,8
Follow me!


457
1:13:26,8 --> 1:15:22,614
Groggy, the telegraph wires.


458
1:15:22,614 --> 1:15:27,786
- Good day, gentlemen.
- Good day, sir.


459
1:15:27,786 --> 1:17:20,191
- Sir.
- Good afternoon.


460
1:17:20,191 --> 1:18:5,903
The other side.


461
1:18:5,903 --> 1:18:7,864
Eleven...


462
1:18:7,864 --> 1:18:12,201
twelve...


463
1:18:12,201 --> 1:20:55,365
Fourteen...


464
1:20:55,365 --> 1:22:20,284
Let's go!


465
1:22:20,284 --> 1:22:23,663
What are you doin' here?
You're not runnin' away, are you?


466
1:22:23,663 --> 1:22:25,456
No, I'm not running away.


467
1:22:25,456 --> 1:22:29,21
I'm going after them and I'm going
alone. Our partnership is dissolved.


468
1:22:29,21 --> 1:22:31,87
Boy, let's wait
and talk it over.


469
1:22:31,87 --> 1:22:35,341
All we've done is talk.
I've been reasonable with no results.


470
1:22:35,341 --> 1:22:38,678
Now take it easy. We only knew
the Santa Cruz part of this plan.


471
1:22:38,678 --> 1:22:41,889
You were the one who had
their strategy all worked out.


472
1:22:41,889 --> 1:22:45,56
- Now I'm gonna meet lndio.
- I see. I better go along.


473
1:22:45,56 --> 1:22:47,562
I'm going alone-- Me.


474
1:22:47,562 --> 1:22:51,65
I have an appointment with lndio
and I'm not gonna let anyone interfere.


475
1:22:51,65 --> 1:22:54,11
- You certain about that?
- That's right.


476
1:22:54,11 --> 1:23:0,45
In that case I'm sorry.


477
1:23:0,45 --> 1:23:5,246
That's not bad. Indio sent
four men to Santa Cruz.


478
1:23:5,246 --> 1:23:8,541
And one man returns--
a new man without a scratch.


479
1:23:8,541 --> 1:23:10,71
Mm-mm. Indio's no idiot.


480
1:23:10,71 --> 1:23:15,298
When you ride up to him and show him
that little nick, he might believe you.


481
1:23:15,298 --> 1:23:17,467
And don't forget,
that as of today...


482
1:23:17,467 --> 1:23:20,178
the whole gang's worth
$40,000 more.


483
1:23:20,178 --> 1:23:23,264
That's the reward offered by the bank
to get the money back.


484
1:23:23,264 --> 1:23:27,143
- Is the partnership operating again?
- Just how do you figure?


485
1:23:27,143 --> 1:23:32,107
Try to convince lndio to go north,
and then go along the Rio Bravo.


486
1:23:32,107 --> 1:23:35,36
It's a good spot for an ambush
and we can get him between two fires.


487
1:23:35,36 --> 1:23:40,532
You on the outside,
me on the inside, right?


488
1:23:40,532 --> 1:23:46,121
North?


489
1:23:46,121 --> 1:24:6,766
North.


490
1:24:6,766 --> 1:24:16,318
Hughie.


491
1:24:16,318 --> 1:24:50,352
Wait a minute. We need time to open it
and this isn't the right place.


492
1:24:50,352 --> 1:24:52,62
And the others?


493
1:24:52,62 --> 1:24:54,731
Dead?


494
1:24:54,731 --> 1:25:0,696
After Santa Cruz, we headed for EI Paso
and they hit us from all sides.


495
1:25:0,696 --> 1:25:23,552
And you just saved your own skin,
isn't that right, you yellow--


496
1:25:23,552 --> 1:25:26,93
You did your part of it.
Let's go.


497
1:25:26,93 --> 1:25:29,641
Which way we headed?


498
1:25:29,641 --> 1:25:31,101
North.


499
1:25:31,101 --> 1:25:34,354
North? Along Rio Bravo canyon?


500
1:25:34,354 --> 1:25:37,316
Why not?


501
1:25:37,316 --> 1:25:41,904
Seems like a good place
for an ambush to me.


502
1:25:41,904 --> 1:25:43,906
You know a better way to go?


503
1:25:43,906 --> 1:25:47,91
Yeah, south.


504
1:25:47,91 --> 1:25:49,62
Ride to the border?


505
1:25:49,62 --> 1:26:0,13
They'll never expect you to cross the
border now that the alarm's been sent.


506
1:26:0,13 --> 1:26:2,424
Think we'll head east.


507
1:26:2,424 --> 1:26:6,804
There's a place I know about,
Agua Caliente.


508
1:26:6,804 --> 1:26:10,891
Here we are.
That's Agua Caliente.


509
1:26:10,891 --> 1:26:13,811
Yes, I have many friends here.


510
1:26:13,811 --> 1:26:16,897
It looks just like a morgue.


511
1:26:16,897 --> 1:26:19,24
But look out.


512
1:26:19,24 --> 1:26:22,403
It could be one so easily.


513
1:26:22,403 --> 1:26:27,7
- They don't like strangers.
- No, they don't like anybody.


514
1:26:27,7 --> 1:26:35,75
Wild, you never saw
our friend here shoot, right?


515
1:26:35,75 --> 1:26:40,463
Did any of you?


516
1:26:40,463 --> 1:26:44,216
We don't know how you'd be
in emergencies.


517
1:26:44,216 --> 1:26:46,844
I was thinking,
this is the right place.


518
1:26:46,844 --> 1:26:51,515
I got a way
you can show the men.


519
1:26:51,515 --> 1:26:54,518
How's that?


520
1:26:54,518 --> 1:29:42,938
Go into town alone, amigo.


521
1:29:42,938 --> 1:30:34,698
Bravo.


522
1:30:34,698 --> 1:30:37,535
Do you mind tellin' me
how you got here?


523
1:30:37,535 --> 1:30:40,162
I just reasoned it out.


524
1:30:40,162 --> 1:30:42,456
I figured you'd tell lndio...


525
1:30:42,456 --> 1:30:45,96
to do just exactly the opposite
of what we agreed...


526
1:30:45,96 --> 1:30:50,89
and he's suspicious enough
to figure out somethin' else.


527
1:30:50,89 --> 1:30:55,97
Since EI Paso was out of the question,
well, here I am.


528
1:30:55,97 --> 1:30:58,931
Rum-- a double.


529
1:30:58,931 --> 1:31:17,616
Tequila for all of us.


530
1:31:17,616 --> 1:31:31,505
If it isn't the smoker.


531
1:31:31,505 --> 1:31:35,968
Remember me, amigo?


532
1:31:35,968 --> 1:31:42,225
Of course you do. EI Paso.


533
1:31:42,225 --> 1:31:44,769
It's a small world.


534
1:31:44,769 --> 1:31:48,606
Yes, and very, very bad.


535
1:31:48,606 --> 1:31:53,528
Now, come on.
You light another match.


536
1:31:53,528 --> 1:31:57,907
I generally smoke just after I eat.
Come back in ten minutes.


537
1:31:57,907 --> 1:32:1,911
Ten minutes you'll be smoking
in hell. Get up!


538
1:32:1,911 --> 1:32:5,54
Stay calm.


539
1:32:5,54 --> 1:32:15,174
On your feet.


540
1:32:15,174 --> 1:32:18,11
Cucillo.


541
1:32:18,11 --> 1:32:29,439
Count to three.


542
1:32:29,439 --> 1:32:33,151
One...


543
1:32:33,151 --> 1:32:36,446
two...


544
1:32:36,446 --> 1:32:41,785
three!


545
1:32:41,785 --> 1:33:5,767
Stop it!


546
1:33:5,767 --> 1:33:9,62
Who are you?


547
1:33:9,62 --> 1:33:15,777
I'm the one who can open
the safe for you.


548
1:33:15,777 --> 1:33:17,237
What safe, senor?


549
1:33:17,237 --> 1:33:20,782
The one from EI Paso.
You got there ahead of me.


550
1:33:20,782 --> 1:33:24,619
- However--
- However?


551
1:33:24,619 --> 1:33:28,415
Open that safe and you're gonna
destroy half the bank notes.


552
1:33:28,415 --> 1:33:39,384
I can open it
without blowing it up.


553
1:33:39,384 --> 1:33:40,886
What'll it cost?


554
1:33:40,886 --> 1:33:46,58
Five thousand.


555
1:33:46,58 --> 1:33:49,144
Two's all I'll pay you.


556
1:33:49,144 --> 1:34:27,975
Five.


557
1:34:27,975 --> 1:34:29,977
Keep your hands off it!


558
1:34:29,977 --> 1:34:33,522
It's easy to steal.
The trouble is in keeping the loot.


559
1:34:33,522 --> 1:34:35,858
Take it out.


560
1:34:35,858 --> 1:34:38,277
Now every man in New Mexico
is after us.


561
1:34:38,277 --> 1:34:41,989
If they catch one of us with money
we'll all end up the same way.


562
1:34:41,989 --> 1:34:45,951
We're going to wait here for an
entire month if I think it's necessary.


563
1:34:45,951 --> 1:34:48,996
Then everybody will get his share.


564
1:34:48,996 --> 1:34:52,708
And you will wait a month
to get your money.


565
1:34:52,708 --> 1:34:54,376
Naturally.


566
1:34:54,376 --> 1:34:56,837
I'll be in the tavern.


567
1:34:56,837 --> 1:35:1,8
The air around here stinks anyway,
just like the food.


568
1:35:1,8 --> 1:35:43,259
But the month will go fast.


569
1:35:43,259 --> 1:35:45,72
Right here.


570
1:35:45,72 --> 1:38:11,658
Let's go.


571
1:38:11,658 --> 1:38:13,952
I was worried about you.


572
1:38:13,952 --> 1:38:34,431
All alone with, uh,
so many problems to solve.


573
1:38:34,431 --> 1:38:41,897
It's all right here.


574
1:38:41,897 --> 1:39:51,884
Go ahead.


575
1:39:51,884 --> 1:40:6,44
You shouldn't have shot
the apples off that tree.


576
1:40:6,44 --> 1:41:47,167
Put it on.


577
1:41:47,167 --> 1:41:50,211
What's he doing now,
this sheriff of EI Paso?


578
1:41:50,211 --> 1:41:54,674
Right now? Lookin' for the cash
that was in the bank.


579
1:41:54,674 --> 1:41:56,509
Right.


580
1:41:56,509 --> 1:42:1,389
And suppose he finds the bodies
of these men just outside EI Paso...


581
1:42:1,389 --> 1:42:5,226
with lots of money on them?


582
1:42:5,226 --> 1:42:7,27
What will the sheriff think?


583
1:42:7,27 --> 1:42:9,147
Well, he--


584
1:42:9,147 --> 1:43:29,436
That's right.


585
1:43:29,436 --> 1:43:34,233
Slim.


586
1:43:34,233 --> 1:43:37,694
What is it, Nino?


587
1:43:37,694 --> 1:43:39,488
A change of plans.


588
1:43:39,488 --> 1:44:23,157
Indio wants you to--


589
1:44:23,157 --> 1:44:48,849
It's not loaded.


590
1:44:48,849 --> 1:44:51,56
I think you should
get out fast now.


591
1:44:51,56 --> 1:44:54,897
Here's your guns without bullets.


592
1:44:54,897 --> 1:45:46,491
Listen. Don't you let lndio
find you both around.


593
1:45:46,491 --> 1:45:52,997
I know you don't like questions,
but why are you doing this?


594
1:45:52,997 --> 1:45:57,919
How long have you known
that Monco's a bounty killer?


595
1:45:57,919 --> 1:46:3,341
I found out tonight. Why?


596
1:46:3,341 --> 1:46:12,1
I knew he was one from
the first moment he arrived.


597
1:46:12,1 --> 1:46:16,646
The other one's also
a bounty killer.


598
1:46:16,646 --> 1:46:18,773
So I have an idea.


599
1:46:18,773 --> 1:46:22,277
They'll be useful to us.


600
1:46:22,277 --> 1:46:24,988
We'll try it.


601
1:46:24,988 --> 1:46:28,533
Those men are a lot better
than mine with a gun.


602
1:46:28,533 --> 1:46:32,912
So we'll let all of them
get mixed up in a gun battle.


603
1:46:32,912 --> 1:46:38,418
But that won't
really matter to me.


604
1:46:38,418 --> 1:46:42,88
Or you.


605
1:46:42,88 --> 1:46:50,638
Because we'll be far away, right?


606
1:46:50,638 --> 1:46:55,852
And we'll have all the money.


607
1:46:55,852 --> 1:46:57,729
Go on.


608
1:46:57,729 --> 1:47:49,406
Go on and wake Cucillo.


609
1:47:49,406 --> 1:47:50,824
Who did it?


610
1:47:50,824 --> 1:48:1,668
Why don't you look
at the knife?


611
1:48:1,668 --> 1:48:3,712
It's mine.


612
1:48:3,712 --> 1:48:16,308
Then it shouldn't be there,
should it?


613
1:48:16,308 --> 1:48:21,98
But I didn't kill him.
I didn't do it.


614
1:48:21,98 --> 1:48:27,402
It's difficult to prove that.


615
1:48:27,402 --> 1:48:28,946
I am innocent.


616
1:48:28,946 --> 1:48:32,533
One of your horses is outside.


617
1:48:32,533 --> 1:49:22,75
Let's see if you can get to it.


618
1:49:22,75 --> 1:49:26,212
He just killed Slim.


619
1:49:26,212 --> 1:49:34,261
And he-- he helped those
two bounty killers get away.


620
1:49:34,261 --> 1:49:37,473
I want them back...


621
1:49:37,473 --> 1:49:52,113
right now.


622
1:49:52,113 --> 1:49:54,448
What are you doing here?


623
1:49:54,448 --> 1:50:1,205
Go and get them back!


624
1:50:1,205 --> 1:50:11,9
Those two bounty killers are sitting on
our backs and must be killed right away.


625
1:50:11,9 --> 1:50:27,94
We can't let 'em go free.


626
1:50:27,94 --> 1:50:31,527
It's done now.


627
1:50:31,527 --> 1:51:16,781
Prepare to get out of here.


628
1:51:16,781 --> 1:51:19,826
Here.


629
1:51:19,826 --> 1:51:26,124
Hold it.


630
1:51:26,124 --> 1:51:29,44
Not a bad idea.


631
1:51:29,44 --> 1:51:31,63
But I'm one thing
you forgot about.


632
1:51:31,63 --> 1:51:55,111
Open it up now.


633
1:51:55,111 --> 1:52:55,839
All right, come on now,
open it.


634
1:52:55,839 --> 1:53:0,928
Leave lndio to me.


635
1:53:0,928 --> 1:53:34,795
All right.


636
1:53:34,795 --> 1:54:5,201
Where in hell is it?


637
1:54:5,201 --> 1:54:8,746
I'll kill 'em, but I'll rip
out their guts first.


638
1:54:8,746 --> 1:54:17,129
I have a plan.


639
1:54:17,129 --> 1:54:19,215
What?


640
1:54:19,215 --> 1:54:21,425
Let's just wait.


641
1:54:21,425 --> 1:54:25,596
They'll be back here.


642
1:54:25,596 --> 1:54:28,933
And this way,
there'll be two of us.


643
1:54:28,933 --> 1:54:32,186
Can they come back here?
Your men could've killed them.


644
1:54:32,186 --> 1:54:37,525
Who? They?


645
1:54:37,525 --> 1:54:44,699
Are you sure of that?
That they haven't?


646
1:54:44,699 --> 1:54:46,993
I thought something different.


647
1:54:46,993 --> 1:54:51,914
You made the boys ride on out to
make sure they're both killed, and fast.


648
1:54:51,914 --> 1:54:56,252
I'm not as dumb
as the rest of them.


649
1:54:56,252 --> 1:56:31,765
There was no help for it.


650
1:56:31,765 --> 1:58:21,25
Go on.


651
1:58:21,25 --> 1:58:24,17
That watch--


652
1:58:24,17 --> 1:58:28,424
It's been a long time
that I wanted to ask.


653
1:58:28,424 --> 1:58:31,26
I can see that it means
a lot to you.


654
1:58:31,26 --> 2:0:9,484
Why?


655
2:0:9,484 --> 2:0:12,904
Listen to me!


656
2:0:12,904 --> 2:0:17,659
This is Colonel Mortimer!


657
2:0:17,659 --> 2:0:21,579
Douglas Mortimer!


658
2:0:21,579 --> 2:1:56,55
Does the name
mean anything to you?


659
2:1:56,55 --> 2:1:59,887
When the chimes end,
pick up your gun.


660
2:1:59,887 --> 2:2:4,892
Try and shoot me, Colonel.


661
2:2:4,892 --> 2:4:2,9
Just try.


662
2:4:2,9 --> 2:4:30,58
Very careless of you, old man.


663
2:4:30,58 --> 2:4:39,38
Try this.


664
2:4:39,38 --> 2:6:31,952
Now we start.


665
2:6:31,952 --> 2:7:14,828
Bravo.


666
2:7:14,828 --> 2:7:23,837
There seems to be
a family resemblance.


667
2:7:23,837 --> 2:7:30,94
Here.


668
2:7:30,94 --> 2:7:33,97
Naturally, between
brother and sister.


669
2:7:33,97 --> 2:7:39,812
My gun.


670
2:7:39,812 --> 2:7:42,148
My boy...


671
2:7:42,148 --> 2:7:44,567
you've become rich.


672
2:7:44,567 --> 2:7:47,319
You mean we've become rich,
old man.


673
2:7:47,319 --> 2:7:51,49
No, it's all for you.
I think you deserve it.


674
2:7:51,49 --> 2:7:56,245
What about our partnership?


675
2:7:56,245 --> 2:8:40,581
Maybe next time.


676
2:8:40,581 --> 2:8:44,919
Ten thousand, twelve thousand...


677
2:8:44,919 --> 2:8:47,338
fifteen...


678
2:8:47,338 --> 2:8:49,132
sixteen...


679
2:8:49,132 --> 2:8:52,176
seventeen...


680
2:8:52,176 --> 2:9:1,853
twenty-two--


681
2:9:1,853 --> 2:9:5,523
Twenty-seven.


682
2:9:5,523 --> 2:9:9,569
Any trouble, boy?


683
2:9:9,569 --> 2:9:12,53
No, old man.


684
2:9:12,53 --> 2:9:15,7
Thought I was having trouble
with my adding.


685
2:9:15,7 --> 2:11:15,7
It's all right now.
