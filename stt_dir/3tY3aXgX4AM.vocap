###11 THAT THE QUESTIONS ARE UP ON BSPACE.
###17 SO THE INTENTION
###24 COLLEAGUES AS A MEANS OF LEARNING ABOUT THEM. ANY QUESTIONS
###32 CAN HELP YOU WITH NOW? YES.
###46 NO. THE MIDTERM IS 33 QUESTIONS. SHE ASKED IF
###54 NOT MEANT TO REFLECT
###59 QUESTIONS.
###64 THIS IS WHAT THE MIDTERM IS LIKE. CAN'T PROMISE THAT. HAVEN'T WRITTEN THE MIDTERM YET. I DON'T
###69 KNOW WHAT
###74 IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU GUYS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT A
###80 THAT I WRITE. I DIDN'T WRITE
###85 AND THEY
###91 THE TEXT. SO DON'T SLACK OFF, PLEASE. WHAT ELSE?
###98 E-MAIL ME IF ANYTHING COMES UP THAT YOU NEED
###106 ECOSYSTEM ECOLOGY. AND WE WILL FIRST
###119 COVER SOME GEOLOGY REALLY. AS A MEANS OF UNDERSTANDING THE
###126 ON A GLOBAL SCALE IN THE
###137 THE TERRESTRIAL BIOMES OF THE WORLD
###143 CONTEXT OF GLOBAL PRECIPITATION AND TEMPERATURE
###152 BIOMES, FOCUSING
###161 LIMITATION AND PRODUCTIVITY OF SUCH SYSTEMS. AND THEN
###169 ON A GLOBAL SCALE COMPARING
###180 GRADIENTS. AND THE CAUSES BEHIND HIGH TROPICAL DIVERSITY.
###189 I HAVEN'T PUT IN BEFORE AND I
###193 I DIDN'T BULLET IT HERE. AND I'M NOT SURE IF
###198 CYCLES. IF WE
###204 BOOK BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GO INTO MUCH MORE DETAIL THAN THE BOOK ALREADY PROVIDES.
###211 ALL RIGHT. FOR SOME OF YOU THIS WILL BE REVIEW. FOR OTHERS
###217 IS OF INTEREST AND IMPORTANCE. BECAUSE YOU'RE
###221 OF GLOBAL CLIMATE. AND MORE AND MORE
###231 SEEING IN RECENT
###237 THING TO CONSIDER AND I WON'T REVIEW MUCH HERE IS THE FACT
###243 OF BEING SPHERICAL RECEIVES SOLAR
###253 AS A
###259 MORE OBLIQUELY TOWARD THE POLES AND THIS MEANS
###266 TILTED ON ITS AXIS AND IT
###277 DETAILS OF THAT PHYSICAL PROCESS ISN'T OF IMPORTANCE BUT YOU CAN READ ABOUT IT IN THE
###283 BOOK IF YOU WANT. IT'S NOT OF IMPORTANCE FOR OUR PURPOSES.
###291 OF SOLAR ENERGY AT THE EQUATOR,
###304 HEATED IT
###311 OUT IN RAINS AND GENERATES OF PHENOMENON OF THE HOT WET
###322 CONTINUES ITS ASCENT LOSING
###329 DESCENDS. NOTE WHERE WE ARE ON THE EARTH. SOME 23 DEGREES
###337 THE SAME PHENOMENON IS HAPPENING IN
###344 AIR ABSORBS
###353 A RESULT, THESE TEND TO BE VERY ARID REGIONS. AND
###358 INDEED SITUATED AT THESE LATITUDES,
###364 PLACES ON THE EARTH.
###378 OF IT WILL
###388 AND IT DROPS IT AGAIN IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD.
###394 TROPICS BUT STILL A LOT.
###399 LIKE
###404 WHERE YOU GET
###410 OF THIS VERY PHENOMENON. SOMETHING SIMILAR IS HAPPENING
###416 AND ARGENTINA WITH THESE TEMPERATE
###424 AND THEN FOLLOW YOU CAN FOLLOW IT FURTHER
###428 NOW DRIED DESCENDS OVER THE POLES, DRY
###434 ARE QUITE
###445 EQUATOR HOW MUCH CAN BE EXPLAINED ABOUT
###450 PRECIPITATION BUT
###460 JUST HIGHLIGHT A FEW THINGS HERE THOUGH. THE FACT THAT THE
###466 AT THE EQUATOR AS A RESULT OF INTENSE SOLAR
###475 ON THE SURFACE WATERS,
###482 IT
###492 DEEP AND CIRCULATES IN DEEP CHANNELS
###501 REMAIN IN THESE
###508 ITS WAY BACK TO THE SURFACE IN THE WARMER WATER CONDITIONS.
###518 BETWEEN WARM AND COLD CURRENTS IN THIS
###529 IS HAPPENING
###539 PRIMARILY TO THE TEMPERATURE DEFERENTIAL BETWEEN OUR OLD
###544 WARMER, BUT THEY'RE STILL VERY COLD
###550 INTERACTION OF THOSE COLD CURRENT WITH WARM AIR MASSES IS IN PART
###557 GENERATION OF FOG OVER OUR WATERS, OFF-SHORE
###567 FOG, OVER THE
###574 LAND BY WINDS BEHIND IT, BUT SOME OF IT IS PULLED ONTO
###581 OF WARM AIR OVER THE LAND RISING,
###588 OR IN THE
###594 AND THE COOL AIR FROM THE OCEANS IS BEING DRAWN IN TO
###601 AND THERE'S OFTEN FOG IN THE
###608 WORKS
###617 THIS KIND OF CYCLE. SO HIGHLIGHTING THAT IN
###622 EFFECT ON
###629 REPLACED BY COOL MARINE AIR. AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES
###636 CLIMATES THAN AREAS INLAND.
###642 WHERE THE WARM AIR FROM THE LAND IS WARMING UP THE COOL OCEANIC AIR.
###654 AT THIS FOG PHENOMENON BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE
###660 OUR POSITION RIGHT HERE ON EARTH.
###666 EVIDENCED BY
###672 AND IN RELATION TO REDWOOD COMMUNITIES. LOOK AT THE
###679 REALLY FOGGY IN THE SUMMER,
###683 SUMMER.
###687 PART OF THIS SUMMER AND NOT MUCH SUNSHINE. WHEN THESE
###694 AT THE RAIN FALL. RAINFALL IS AT
###704 THINK
###713 GET SUCH MASSIVE FORESTS GROWING IN THIS AREA
###721 TIMES OF THE YEAR? AS
###732 ON THIS IS JUST FABULOUS. DONE BY VARIOUS TEAMS OF RESEARCHERS
###737 LAB, TODD DAWSON'S HERE. THESE ARE, THESE, THE STUDY
###744 IN ECOPHYSIOLOGY. AND THE DATA
###758 THE SCIENCE
###766 TALK MORE ABOUT BIOGEOCHEMISTRY NEXT WEEK. HERE'S, SHOWING THE FOG
###775 BURR. I HEARD ONE SAY IT'S LIKE A COZY
###783 MORE ACCEPTABLE.
###784 IT CAN REALLY MAKE THINGS FRIGID THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE SUMMER.
###793 ISOTOPE CHEMISTRY TO UNDERSTAND
###801 THAT REAL QUICK.
###801 LOOK AT THAT WORD.
###812 IS THE STUDY OF THIS KIND OF INTERACTIVE SYSTEM. IT'S THE
###821 BETWEEN LIFE AND EARTH.
###831 PHYSIOLOGY RELATED TO THE ECOLOGY OF INDIVIDUAL ORGANISMS IN THE
###839 THESE ARE GREAT INTEGRATIVE
###845 DEPARTMENT IN INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY WHO ARE SUPERB IN THIS WORK. AS I SAID,
###852 DON'T NEED TO UNDERSTAND ISOTOPES IN A CHEMICAL SENSE TO
###859 THAT ATOMIC ELEMENTS EXIST IN
###866 NEUTRONS IN THEIR NUCLEUS. SO ISOTOPE
###878 ISOTOPE, IN THIS
###885 JUST RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A QUANTIFICATION OF ATOMIC NUCLEI IN
###897 IN FOG AND THE WATER IN RAINFALL. SO RAIN
###908 THEIR HYDROGEN
###916 A LOT OF THE HEAVY ISOTOPE DEUTERIUM IN IT. MUCH DIFFERENT
###921 THEY'RE COMPLETELY DISTINCT.
###929 COMMUNITY INCLUDING, I'M SORRY, IN THE REDWOOD COMMUNITY, INCLUDING REDWOODS
###934 SEQUOIA SEMPERVIRENS, YOU SEE THAT THE WATER INSIDE THESE PLANTS
###947 BETWEEN THE FOG AND THE RAINFALL. AND
###957 OF EACH YEAR.
###965 MATH AND THE DETERMINE THAT ALMOST A THIRD OF THE WATER USED BY
###972 SYSTEMS IS COMING FROM FOG ITSELF. IT'S, THE
###979 BUT THE FOG IS
###985 BY THE PLANTS. AND THAT'S FANTASTIC, THAT'S REALLY COOL.
###993 MAGNIFICENT FORESTS OF SUCH COMPLEXITY
###1000 DURING THE
###1006 ABOUT WHAT CHANGES IN FOG LEVELS, WHAT KIND OF IMPACT THAT
###1013 IN THE CONTEXT OF GLOBAL CLIMATE
###1020 QUITE A
###1031 A LAND MASS DROPS ITS MOISTURE DURING THE ASCENT, SUCH
###1040 SIDE OF MOUNTAIN, IT'S LOST ALL
###1048 SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN YOU OFTEN GET AREAS OF GREAT ARIDITY.
###1055 DESERT IN THE SOUTH AS A RESULT OF RAIN
###1060 BASIN. THIS IS A PICTURE OF THE MOHAVE DESERT
###1070 OF YOUR GREAT
###1081 SO THAT'S SOME OF THE GLOBAL BACKGROUND TO THE DISTRIBUTION
###1088 BROAD BRUSHSTROKE. BUT IT'S HELPFUL.
###1098 COMMUNITY
###1107 IT'S ACTUALLY MANY COMMUNITIES THAT SHARE CERTAIN
###1114 DISTINGUISHABLE FROM
###1123 THEY'RE DISTINCT IN TERMS OF THE ORGANISMS THAT LIVE THERE,
###1131 THAT THEY'RE EXPOSED TO AND PARTLY DRIVEN BY
###1135 WAYS. YOU NEED TO
###1143 SPEAK OF LEAVING THE MICROSCOPE IN THE LAB AND TAKING
###1148 OUT TO THE FILED AND SEEING WHOLE SYSTEMS THROUGH THAT. IT'S A METAPHOR OBVIOUSLY.
###1157 HOW DO YOU DISTINGUISH THESE BIOMES? YOU CAN DO IT YOURSELF
###1162 KNOW AS A RESULT OF WHAT IS,
###1174 APPEARANCE, HOW THEY LOOK TO YOU.
###1180 ON THE EDGES.
###1187 NOT KNOW SPECIFICALLY WHAT KIND OF ECOSYSTEM IT IS BUT
###1193 LOOKS LIKE A SEASONAL DRY FOREST OR SOMETHING LIKE
###1198 LOOK LIKE NEAR SOME NATURAL
###1203 THAT'S A CHAPARRAL, THIS NEAR AREA WITH THESE, THE TREES ARE
###1213 IN HERE. MOSTLY SHRUBBY LOW-LYING
###1220 SEE MORE
###1226 SPINDLY TREES AND THESE ARE YOUR SHRUBBY LOWER LYING BITS OF VEGETATION.
###1232 OF THIS SYSTEM. THAT'S A VERY LUSH SYSTEM WITH LOTS OF EPITHETIC GROWTH, PLANTS
###1237 ON OTHER PLANTS. THESE TRUNKS ARE CAKED WITH GREEN
###1248 FROM THE CANOPY. YOU HAVE
###1253 THIS IS? SOMEONE SAID A CLOUD FOREST. YEAH, IT COULD VERY
###1258 WELL BE A CLOUD FOREST OR A RAINFOREST. A TROPICAL
###1266 LUSH FOREST. THIS ONE LOOKS
###1270 RAINFOREST.
###1282 MODULE WHAT THESE THINGS
###1292 DRY. OCCASIONAL SPOTTY TREES. IT'S A SAVANNA. RIGHT.
###1298 TELL BY THE STRIPPY HORSES HERE
###1316 GRADUALLY SLOPING HILLS. ERODED, THESE ERODED HILLTOPS,
###1324 OR GRAZING PROBABLY. SCATTERED TREES, OAKS.
###1330 EAST BAY. SO I'M JUST GIVING
###1336 YOU RECOGNIZE
###1341 SYSTEMS YOU USE TO DISTINGUISH AMONG THEM. IT'S JUST A NATURAL THING
###1347 LET'S PUT SOME TECHNICAL NAMES ON THEM SO YOU KNOW
###1352 SENSE AND THAT WOULD BE THE
###1362 WHERE ON YOUR AXES OF PRECIPITATION AND TEMPERATURE,
###1373 VEGETATION MORE
###1379 IT'S
###1392 CAN
###1399 REAL HOT, BUT REALLY DRY, YOU GET A DESERT.
###1411 MIGHT HAVE A
###1419 REALLY HOT BUT REALLY WET, TALKING ABOUT A
###1428 SAVANNAS? WHAT ELSE
###1435 I JUST LIKE SAVANNAS. OR IF
###1444 MORE MOISTURE.
###1450 ALL OF
###1455  STILL THERE'S A LOT OF MOISTURE. NOT AS MUCH AS IN A TROPICAL
###1460 NOT AS HOT. BUT THAT'S OUR TEMPERATE RAINFOREST THAT
###1465 DROVE UP THE COAST. COOL. AND JUST
###1475 JUST
###1483 PROVIDES. AND WE'LL
###1489 DETAILS ON THE STRUCTURE OF THESE SYSTEMS, WHAT DISTINGUISHES
###1493 MUCH TIME ON THAT. I ALREADY
###1505 AROUND THE WORLD, THIS ONE FROM BORNEO.
###1512 COURSE. SOME FABULOUS ONES IN CENTRAL AMERICA. SOUTHEAST ASIA. THESE
###1520 THESE ARE INTENSELY MODIFIED
###1531 HARVESTING OF TIMBER, AND THESE ARE THE SO-CALLED
###1536 THEY'RE MAJOR
###1547 SO THE LOSS OF THESE SYSTEMS IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO
###1555 ON THE GLOBAL ATMOSPHERE.
###1565 THESE
###1574 MOISTURE. SOMETIMES THE LEAVES ARE JUST
###1580 FUNCTION BUT ALSO HELP TO AVOID
###1592 YOU WOULDN'T SEE THIS KIND OF THING IN A RAINFOREST WHERE THE
###1597 THE LAYER OF LEAFY GROWTH OF
###1603 A CLOSED CANOPY.
###1604 THIS IS A VERY OPEN CANOPY, THERE'S A LOT OF
###1615 SO WHAT IS IT ABOUT
###1621 A
###1626 MAINTENANCE? SOMEBODY MUST HAVE AN IDEA.
###1629 STUDENT: HERDS OF ANIMALS.
###1632 PROFESSOR: HERDS OF ANIMALS, YEAH. GRAZING IS OF BIG IMPORTANCE IN A
###1641 GREAT IMPORTANCE. SO YEAH, THAT'S ONE
###1647 AND DRY SEASONS.
###1651 DOES A DRY SEASONAL FOREST. SO WHY A DRY SEASONAL FOREST
###1659 STILL SURVIVE AN INTENSATIVE
###1665 STUDENT: FIRES.
###1669 PROFESSOR: FIRES PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN THESE SYSTEMS. AND HELP TO
###1674 SEE OF ITS PHYSIOGNOMY HERE.
###1676 JUST INDIVIDUAL TREES OFTEN GROWING NEAR BEAUTIFUL SPREADING ACACIA
###1679 THAT THE GIRAFFE MIGHT BE NIBBLING ON AS OPPOSED TO MORE EXTENSIVE
###1686 MAY NOT SURVIVE REGULAR BURNS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO SAVANNAS ARE,
###1693 AFRICAN SAVANNAS, ARE PROBABLY IN MANY WAYS EVOLVED
###1702 AND IT'S CERTAINLY INTERESTING TO
###1705 THAT'S BEEN
###1709 AND USE OF FIRE HUMANS OR HUMAN ANCESTORS. CALIFORNIA CHAPARRAL.
###1717 CALL CHAPARRAL OCCURS HERE IN THIS
###1726 A COOL
###1732 OCCURRING WITHOUT MAJOR FOG INPUT IN, FOR
###1738 SUMMER AND A COOL
###1746 
###1750 OUR CLIMATE AS A MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE. AND THIS TYPE OF VEGETATION
###1755 VEGETATION. IT'S NICE. IT THINK YOUR BOOK
###1757 IS THE ONE THAT USES CHAPARRAL. THAT'S GREAT BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY A TERM FROM CALIFORNIA.
###1761 LET'S EXPORT
###1767 AFRICA. MAYBE A BIT IN AUSTRALIA, CERTAINLY A BIT IN
###1779 YOU GET THIS KIND OF STRUCTURED
###1784 CLIMATIC FACTORS. IT'S REALLY PRETTY COOL. THESE ARE
###1789 WE KNOW ALL TOO WELL HERE. TEMPERATE
###1801 FROM THESE WHAT ONCE WERE VAST TEMPERATE GRASSLANDS. THE NORTHERN
###1810 FORESTS MARKED PRIMARILY BY THE CONIFER
###1816 AND HEMLOCKS AND THINGS
###1817 LIKE THAT. AND THE BOREAL FOREST ZONE. IT'S A HUGE REGION. SO IF ONLY FOR THAT REASON,
###1826 IT'S
###1832 OF THE LUNGS OF THE EARTH DOWN HERE, THIS REGION IS
###1838 GAS CAPTURE ON A GLOBAL SCALE.
###1846 SYSTEMS I
###1854 OF DROPPING THE LEAVES OFF THE TREES IN THE FALL AND
###1861 OF THESE AREAS BUT IT'S REALLY
###1869 SO
###1875 LOT OF PRECIPITATION BUT IT'S NOT
###1879 PLANTS
###1884 DROP THEIR LEAVES. THEY'RE DECIDUOUS. THEY DROP THE LEAVES DURING THAT SEASON. THE TUNDRA,
###1893 TREELESS.
###1900 IF YOU ASCEND A MOUNTAIN. YOU CAN ASCEND A MOUNTAIN
###1902 THROUGH THE FORESTS AND GET ABOVE TREE LINE AND GET A TYPE OF ALPINE
###1907 DO THAT IN THE SIERRAS OR IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS
###1910 AND THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE FACT THAT MOUNTAINS, AS YOU MOVE UP A
###1915 TO MOVING UP IN LATITUDE. SO YOU CAN
###1922 MARCHING THROUGH OF
###1927 LATITUDES.
###1935 AGAINST AN ALPINE TUNDRA THAT YOU WOULD SEE UP IN A MOUNTAINOUS AREA.
###1943 GROWTH. NO TREE GROWTH AT ALL.
###1953 WE WANT TO
###1960 AND WITHIN FRESHWATER SYSTEMS, IT'S HELPFUL TO
###1966 FLOWING WATER SYSTEMS.
###1972 THE BOOK USES THEM. I FIND THEM HELPFUL
###1981 SO, IN A
###1991 TERMS IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AQUATIC COMMUNITIES, YOU'LL BE
###1996 TIME. WE DISTINGUISH THESE SYSTEMS IN
###2002 WHERE LIGHT
###2008 SHALLOWS OR ALGAE AND BACTERIA IN THESE OPEN
###2017 LESS LIGHT
###2024 FROM THE SHORELINE AND THE DEPTH. SO THE LITTORAL ZONE IS THIS
###2030 THESE ROOTED PLANTS. AND THE
###2040 AND LET'S
###2045 THIS OPEN WATER ZONE AS AGAINST THE BENTHIC ZONE, THE
###2057 BY THE COMMUNITY OF
###2064 ORGANISMS THAT
###2073 CREATURES THERE. SO HERE ARE TWO LIMNETIC SYSTEMS. ONE
###2085 VERY CLEAR WATERS. NOT MUCH VEGETATION GROWTH.
###2092 DARK, CAN'T SEE THE
###2099 BESIDES AN ELEVATIONAL DISTANCE HERE PERHAPS, LET'S ASSUME THEY'RE AT
###2106 THEY COULD BE. WHAT'S ONE DIFFERENCE IN THESE SYSTEMS IN
###2116 SUBSTRATE? WELL, MAYBE THIS IS A
###2121 DARK. THE
###2126 PROBABLY DIFFERS BUT LET'S JUST SAY THAT
###2130 HILLS AND THIS ONE,
###2135 STUDENT: TEMPERATURE.
###2138 PROFESSOR: TEMPERATURE. IT
###2142 SOMEWHAT HIGHER. BUT LET'S FOCUS ON DIFFERENCES THAT MIGHT EXIST
###2148 THE TEMPERATURE COULD EXIST WITHIN
###2149 THE WATER ITSELF. THIS IS PROBABLY A WARMER BODY OF
###2154 BUT LET'S ASSUME NOT.
###2157 STUDENT: OXYGEN?
###2163 OF THE THINGS I'M THINKING OF, YES.
###2164 STUDENT: LIGHT PENETRATION?
###2170 THE VEGETATION AT THE
###2175 MORE SEDIMENT AND MORE STUFF IN THE WATER. YES?
###2181 STUDENT: NUTRIENTS?
###2182 PROFESSOR: NUTRIENTS IS THE ONE I WAS THINKING
###2186 IN
###2195 ARE TYPICALLY THE MAJOR LIMITING FACTOR IN THE
###2203 NUTRIENT IT IS MAY
###2209 IS POOR IN NUTRIENTS. AND AS A RESULT HAS LITTLE VEGETATIVE
###2218 ACTIVITY IN GENERAL. AS A
###2225 AMOUNT OF OXYGEN AVAILABLE, LESS USED BY THE RESPIRATION OF THE
###2232 WITH MUCH MORE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY, LESS
###2239 AND OUR TERMS WE NEED
###2244 I THINK AT LEAST EUTROPHIC IS HERE.
###2254 SHOWED THE IMPORTANCE OF NUTRIENT INPUTS TO LAKES BY
###2263 LAKE AT THE MIDDLE AND
###2273 AND PHOSPHORUS INTO THIS SIDE. SORRY, NITROGEN, CARBON AND
###2282 ONLY NITROGEN AND CARBON INTO
###2289 AT A
###2294 OF ALGAE OR BLOOMS OF BACTERIA, IN PARTICULAR CYANOBACTERIA IN
###2302 WATERS. AND IT WAS OF BIG CONCERN TO PEOPLE WHEN
###2308 SWIMMABLE TO CHOKED WITH
###2315 
###2322 AS A LIMITING NUTRIENT. THAT WHEN INPUT COULD CAUSE THESE TYPES OF BLOOMS THAT
###2328 CHOKE OTHER ORGANISMS OUT AS A RESULT OF DEPLETION OF OXYGEN
###2337 AND PHOSPHORUS WAS ENTERING
###2342 AND
###2348 LOCAL
###2356 EFFECT ON
###2365 SOMEWHERE IN THE
###2369 ALSO. SAVANNAS I LIKE, BUT
###2376 ECOTONE BETWEEN
###2382 HAVE A RIM OF TREES, VEGETATION, A RIPARIAN ZONE IF THIS WERE A FLOWING BODY. AND THEN
###2389 THIS
###2400 OKAY. SO A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF FLOWING SYSTEMS. OF
###2407 AS A BUNCH OF LITTLE CREEKS
###2411 FORM BIG A
###2417 THIS AND A SYSTEM LIKE THIS DIFFER A LOT FROM ONES IN LAKES.
###2420 THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT PHYSICAL FORCES TO DEAL WITH.
###2423 FLOWING WATER IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM STILL WATER. ULTIMATELY
###2429 FLOW INTO THE SEA TYPICALLY. THERE ARE
###2435 AND AT THE COAST THEY MAY FORM
###2440 IT'S A DELTA SYSTEM,
###2441 DELTAIC SYSTEM. AND AN ESTUARY, THIS AREA WHERE, THIS AREA INFLUENCED BY THE
###2449 OF THE OCEAN WHERE YOU GET SOME SALTWATER INPUT, SOME MARINE INPUT
###2454 FRESHWATER OUTPUT IS A MIXED WATER SYSTEM, A
###2463 AN ESTUARY. AND THEY'RE
###2467 FROM THE
###2476 AND ESPECIALLY IN TROPICAL ENVIRONMENT.
###2483 MARINE ZONES
###2489 PHOTIC AND APHOTIC. DISTANCE FROM SHORE. JUST SWAP TERMS A LITTLE BIT.
###2496 OCEANIC ZONE. AND AGAIN OPEN WATER OR BOTTOM, PELAGIC AND BENTHIC.
###2504 THOSE TERMS ARE THE SAME. THE CONTINENTAL
###2510 IS REMEMBER IS JUST THAT ZONE BETWEEN
###2516 TIDE WITH ITS
###2522 ECOTONAL SYSTEM, AN ECOLOGICAL SYSTEM BETWEEN TWO OTHER MAJOR
###2528 AND A TERRESTRIAL ONE. IT'S AN INTERTIDAL SYSTEM. THAT TERM ECOTONE I WON'T
###2534 DEFINE BUT HOPEFULLY YOU ARE GETTING THE IDEA OF WHAT I MEAN BY IT.
###2539 AN INTERTIDAL SYSTEM. PISASTER PERHAPS. THEY ARE YOUR MUSSELS AND
###2545 NICE SYSTEM WITH YOUR KEYSTONE PREDATOR
###2551 RIGHT DOWN COAST HERE.
###2552 YOU CAN SEE TIDE POOLS LIKE THIS ON OUR COAST. AND I URGE YOU
###2560 TO GO CHECK THEM OUT. AND CORAL REEFS, OF COURSE, JUST
###2565 REEFS THAT RECEIVE SO MUCH SOLAR INPUT AS WELL AS NUTRIENTS
###2573 OCCURRING IN WATERS THAT ARE VERY
###2579 YOU BEAUTIFUL
###2583 DRINK AND GAZING ON THE
###2590 DOWN
###2595 POOR AND THERE'S VERY LITTLE GROWTH.
###2602 REEF LIKE THIS, THAT'S
###2609 IN NUTRIENT POOR WATERS? I PUT AN ARTICLE RELATED TO
###2619 NEWS FOLDER. SO PLEASE READ ABOUT IT THERE. IT'S REQUIRED
###2625 GEOGRAPHIC ARTICLE. IT CAN HELP YOU
###2635 CHLOROPHYL,
###2641 VISIBLE LIGHT AND TENDS TO REFLECT OTHER WAVE
###2650 PHYSICAL SURFACES, NON-GROWING
###2655 SATELLITE
###2663 LENGTHS OF LIGHT INTO DIFFERENT SUBSTRATE TYPES, VEGETATION
###2671 IT REFLECTS NOT ONLY THE VEGETATION
###2676 THIS, I DON'T
###2682 LIKE KILOGRAMS OF CARBON PER UNIT SPACE. YOU CAN GET A SENSE
###2690 SURFACES OF THE WORLD ARE. THE GRAY
###2697 NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY IN
###2703 AND YELLOWS ARE MORE PRODUCTIVE
###2711 PRODUCTIVITY WITH SOME
###2717 ENORMOUS SIZE, THE OCEAN HAS ALMOST AS MUCH PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY AS THE
###2724 JUST BECAUSE IT'S SO BIG. BUT NOTE CAREFULLY HOW
###2731 THIS IS PRIMARILY A CONSEQUENCE OF NUTRIENT
###2738 SHELVES WHERE YOU
###2744 OFF OF NUTRIENTS FROM
###2753 BREAKS DOWN VARIOUS ECOSYSTEM TYPES AND BIOMES IN
###2759 SURFACE THEY OCCUPY
###2764 THAT SOME
###2771 BUT
###2777 PRODUCTIVITY THEY'RE FAIRLY LOW. AND THE
###2781 SO PRODUCTIVE AND SO
###2789 OF EARTH'S PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY.
###2799 I'M LOSING YOU GUYS. SO YOU CAN
###2803 IN THE
