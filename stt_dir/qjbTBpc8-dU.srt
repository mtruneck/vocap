3
0:0:3,5 --> 0:0:5,54
KEVIN MORPURGO: According to
Icke, the Isle of Wight is a


4
0:0:5,54 --> 0:0:8,3
world within a world, with
Freemasonry and Satanism at


5
0:0:8,3 --> 0:0:9,44
its center.


6
0:0:9,44 --> 0:0:11,63
The ancient lay lines scoring
the landscape make it a


7
0:0:11,63 --> 0:0:13,91
powerful spiritual hub.


8
0:0:13,91 --> 0:0:17,9
I think the plan is he's going
to show us this stone, which


9
0:0:17,9 --> 0:0:21,4
is part of a old stone circle.


10
0:0:21,4 --> 0:0:23,96
This is the main one where,
apparently, Satanic rituals


11
0:0:23,96 --> 0:0:26,26
happen on a regular basis.


12
0:0:26,26 --> 0:0:31,5



13
0:0:31,5 --> 0:0:34,32
So this is a place here, then,
where you think these


14
0:0:34,32 --> 0:0:35,38
rituals-- or you know
these rituals--


15
0:0:35,38 --> 0:0:36,56
DAVID ICKE: These rituals
definitely go on at


16
0:0:36,56 --> 0:0:37,23
this place up here.


17
0:0:37,23 --> 0:0:38,27
KEVIN MORPURGO: Is this--


18
0:0:38,27 --> 0:0:40,56
DAVID ICKE: It's called
the Longstone.


19
0:0:40,56 --> 0:0:41,86
And in fact, it's two stones.


20
0:0:41,86 --> 0:0:43,43
One's on its side and
one's standing up.


21
0:0:43,43 --> 0:0:46,92
And it's a beautiful walk,
this direction.


22
0:0:46,92 --> 0:0:48,47
KEVIN MORPURGO: Let's go.


23
0:0:48,47 --> 0:0:48,83
After you.


24
0:0:48,83 --> 0:0:51,13
DAVID ICKE: Cheers, mate.


25
0:0:51,13 --> 0:0:54,78
It opens out, eventually, and
you get a fantastic view.


26
0:0:54,78 --> 0:0:55,56
It's interesting.


27
0:0:55,56 --> 0:0:58,32
When you look at the traits--
this is mainstream science.


28
0:0:58,32 --> 0:1:0,66
When you look at the traits of
what we call the "reptilian


29
0:1:0,66 --> 0:1:6,0
brain," reptilian genetics,
which we all have, one of the


30
0:1:6,0 --> 0:1:9,7
traits is an obsession
with ritual.


31
0:1:9,7 --> 0:1:14,32
So when you look at all the pomp
and ceremony of the royal


32
0:1:14,32 --> 0:1:15,65
family, you know?


33
0:1:15,65 --> 0:1:18,22
With Buckingham Palace and all
this stuff, and all the


34
0:1:18,22 --> 0:1:21,92
ceremonies and the guards and
the horses and the colors,


35
0:1:21,92 --> 0:1:25,82
you're looking at ritual.


36
0:1:25,82 --> 0:1:27,51
KEVIN MORPURGO: But you say that
the people that actually


37
0:1:27,51 --> 0:1:28,88
live on the island
are part of this.


38
0:1:28,88 --> 0:1:30,18
There are people--


39
0:1:30,18 --> 0:1:31,15
there's a network on the
island that are--


40
0:1:31,15 --> 0:1:33,31
DAVID ICKE: Oh, big time.


41
0:1:33,31 --> 0:1:35,9
I mean, the Isle of Wight's
a beautiful place.


42
0:1:35,9 --> 0:1:39,19
And if you pick up the higher
levels, the vibrational levels


43
0:1:39,19 --> 0:1:41,52
of it, it's a very pleasant
place to be.


44
0:1:41,52 --> 0:1:46,5
But my goodness me, if there
is a network of Freemasons,


45
0:1:46,5 --> 0:1:48,6
Satanists, and pedophiles
that run this island.


46
0:1:48,6 --> 0:1:49,19
KEVIN MORPURGO: And
this is police--


47
0:1:49,19 --> 0:1:49,93
DAVID ICKE: They run
its government.


48
0:1:49,93 --> 0:1:52,485
KEVIN MORPURGO: --the
government, everything.


49
0:1:52,485 --> 0:1:55,29
We're almost here at the
top to see the Long--


50
0:1:55,29 --> 0:1:55,43
DAVID ICKE: Oh, dilly.


51
0:1:55,43 --> 0:1:57,49
KEVIN MORPURGO: There it is.


52
0:1:57,49 --> 0:1:58,4
The Longstone.


53
0:1:58,4 --> 0:1:59,65
DAVID ICKE: There we go.


54
0:1:59,65 --> 0:2:3,36



55
0:2:3,36 --> 0:2:6,0
It's funny though, you come on
a day like this, it's a nice


56
0:2:6,0 --> 0:2:9,22
day, there's families around,
and you see these stones.


57
0:2:9,22 --> 0:2:12,72
If you could see these on May
1, Halloween, these ritual


58
0:2:12,72 --> 0:2:13,43
periods of the year--


59
0:2:13,43 --> 0:2:14,73
KEVIN MORPURGO: Then you'd be
a totally different story.


60
0:2:14,73 --> 0:2:15,46
DAVID ICKE: You would
see something


61
0:2:15,46 --> 0:2:15,96
very different, yeah.


62
0:2:15,96 --> 0:2:18,335
KEVIN MORPURGO: So this is the
center point of this energy,


63
0:2:18,335 --> 0:2:21,94
then, that they're trying
to tap into?


64
0:2:21,94 --> 0:2:24,7
DAVID ICKE: What they would do,
among many other things,


65
0:2:24,7 --> 0:2:28,29
you'd have them in their robes
and hoods all around here, and


66
0:2:28,29 --> 0:2:30,95
you'd probably have, or you
would have the sacrifice on


67
0:2:30,95 --> 0:2:31,6
the slab here.


68
0:2:31,6 --> 0:2:32,52
KEVIN MORPURGO: This
is the altar?


69
0:2:32,52 --> 0:2:34,35
DAVID ICKE: This is
their altar, yeah.


70
0:2:34,35 --> 0:2:36,23
And what they're doing--


71
0:2:36,23 --> 0:2:38,19
it's horrible, but let's
get the truth out.


72
0:2:38,19 --> 0:2:40,42
What they're doing is
manipulating the sacrifice.


73
0:2:40,42 --> 0:2:42,58
The sacrifice knows the
sacrifice is coming, and who's


74
0:2:42,58 --> 0:2:43,26
going to help them?


75
0:2:43,26 --> 0:2:43,57
Look.


76
0:2:43,57 --> 0:2:44,18
KEVIN MORPURGO: Right.


77
0:2:44,18 --> 0:2:45,86
DAVID ICKE: At midnight
or something.


78
0:2:45,86 --> 0:2:46,59
No one.


79
0:2:46,59 --> 0:2:50,28
And what they then do is they
sacrifice the victim and they


80
0:2:50,28 --> 0:2:55,16
drink the blood immediately,
which has this chemical


81
0:2:55,16 --> 0:2:56,32
substance in it.


82
0:2:56,32 --> 0:2:57,37
And they go crazy.


83
0:2:57,37 --> 0:3:0,73
I mean, I've talked to people
who've been at these rituals,


84
0:3:0,73 --> 0:3:3,37
and how once the sacrifice
happens and the blood runs,


85
0:3:3,37 --> 0:3:4,505
these people go crazy
with blood.


86
0:3:4,505 --> 0:3:12,25
[MUSIC PLAYING]


87
0:3:12,25 --> 0:3:15,1
DAVID ICKE: There was a man
called Stanley Kubrick, the


88
0:3:15,1 --> 0:3:15,78
great filmmaker.


89
0:3:15,78 --> 0:3:16,63
KEVIN MORPURGO: I think
I've heard of him.


90
0:3:16,63 --> 0:3:19,4
DAVID ICKE: Stanley Kubrick was
an insider, and he wanted


91
0:3:19,4 --> 0:3:20,47
to expose it.


92
0:3:20,47 --> 0:3:23,2
And his last movie was called
Eyes Wide Shut.


93
0:3:23,2 --> 0:3:23,4
KEVIN MORPURGO: I've seen it.


94
0:3:23,4 --> 0:3:23,755
Yes.


95
0:3:23,755 --> 0:3:28,55
DAVID ICKE: Now, Eyes Wide Shut,
he died very, very soon


96
0:3:28,55 --> 0:3:30,2
after it was presented to


97
0:3:30,2 --> 0:3:31,87
executives at the film company.


98
0:3:31,87 --> 0:3:34,19
And was given no fanfare
whatsoever when it came out--


99
0:3:34,19 --> 0:3:34,805
KEVIN MORPURGO: They maybe
edited the hell


100
0:3:34,805 --> 0:3:35,89
out of it as well.


101
0:3:35,89 --> 0:3:36,44
DAVID ICKE: Yes, they did.


102
0:3:36,44 --> 0:3:38,73
They took 25 minutes out of it,
which he refused to do.


103
0:3:38,73 --> 0:3:44,6
Now, he filmed a ritual with Tom
Cruise in it, in which I


104
0:3:44,6 --> 0:3:47,0
only know more recently was
a Rothschild mansion.


105
0:3:47,0 --> 0:3:50,99
[MUSIC PLAYING]


106
0:3:50,99 --> 0:3:55,47
DAVID ICKE: And what he filmed
is a mild, mild version of


107
0:3:55,47 --> 0:3:56,56
what goes on.


108
0:3:56,56 --> 0:3:58,1
Because he knew.


109
0:3:58,1 --> 0:3:59,66
And you had the colors.


110
0:3:59,66 --> 0:4:2,94
You have most people in the
ritual in Eyes Wide


111
0:4:2,94 --> 0:4:3,8
Shut were in black.


112
0:4:3,8 --> 0:4:4,94
The main guy was in red.


113
0:4:4,94 --> 0:4:6,15
Here we go again.


114
0:4:6,15 --> 0:4:9,3
You had the orgies going on, and
you had the people being


115
0:4:9,3 --> 0:4:10,73
killed, the lady being killed.


116
0:4:10,73 --> 0:4:12,59
But that was such
a mild version.


117
0:4:12,59 --> 0:4:13,92
I don't know what was
in the 25 minutes


118
0:4:13,92 --> 0:4:15,6
they took out, mind.


119
0:4:15,6 --> 0:4:17,839
Because the real version
is that there's blood


120
0:4:17,839 --> 0:4:20,329
every-bloody-where.


121
0:4:20,329 --> 0:4:24,47
We see a hierarchy in the public
arena of presidents,


122
0:4:24,47 --> 0:4:26,75
secretaries of state, of prime
ministers, secretaries of


123
0:4:26,75 --> 0:4:28,28
state, down, down, down, down.


124
0:4:28,28 --> 0:4:29,84
That's the public hierarchy.


125
0:4:29,84 --> 0:4:31,76
The real hierarchy,
in the shadows,


126
0:4:31,76 --> 0:4:33,31
is the occult hierarchy.


127
0:4:33,31 --> 0:4:36,16
And if you're higher in the
occult hierarchy, the satanic


128
0:4:36,16 --> 0:4:38,16
hierarchy-- which is incredibly
hierarchical, it's


129
0:4:38,16 --> 0:4:39,26
all hierarchical--


130
0:4:39,26 --> 0:4:42,35
then you have more power over
someone higher than you in the


131
0:4:42,35 --> 0:4:44,26
public hierarchy.


132
0:4:44,26 --> 0:4:45,76
KEVIN MORPURGO: You know, people
familiar with your work


133
0:4:45,76 --> 0:4:48,2
would know that you've made
some predictions over the


134
0:4:48,2 --> 0:4:51,24
years, and they've
come to pass.


135
0:4:51,24 --> 0:4:53,75
I mean, I think this may be part
of the reason why people


136
0:4:53,75 --> 0:4:55,43
are really starting to
pick up on your work.


137
0:4:55,43 --> 0:4:56,3
Something like the internet.


138
0:4:56,3 --> 0:4:57,33
What do you see--


139
0:4:57,33 --> 0:4:59,85
because at the moment, this
is how people are getting


140
0:4:59,85 --> 0:5:2,9
information spread
to each other.


141
0:5:2,9 --> 0:5:4,52
It seems, at least at the
moment, to be relatively free


142
0:5:4,52 --> 0:5:5,57
in most countries.


143
0:5:5,57 --> 0:5:6,75
What do you see happening
there?


144
0:5:6,75 --> 0:5:9,7
DAVID ICKE: The big thing that
they're going to say is


145
0:5:9,7 --> 0:5:13,8
because of the danger of
terrorism and terrorists


146
0:5:13,8 --> 0:5:15,56
communicating on the
internet, these


147
0:5:15,56 --> 0:5:18,14
things have to be stopped.


148
0:5:18,14 --> 0:5:20,48
I mean, what did Cameron say
after the London riots?


149
0:5:20,48 --> 0:5:22,25
We may have to talk about


150
0:5:22,25 --> 0:5:26,9
censoring Twitter and Facebook.


151
0:5:26,9 --> 0:5:27,1
And Bill Clinton--


152
0:5:27,1 --> 0:5:30,92
and when Bill Clinton, like Tony
Blair or George Bush or


153
0:5:30,92 --> 0:5:32,84
anybody, when they open
their mouths, it's


154
0:5:32,84 --> 0:5:34,42
the Rothschilds speaking.


155
0:5:34,42 --> 0:5:37,7
And just a few months ago,
Bill Clinton came out and


156
0:5:37,7 --> 0:5:42,3
said, we need, basically,
a censor organization, a


157
0:5:42,3 --> 0:5:47,34
Ministry of Truth, to police
the internet and to stop


158
0:5:47,34 --> 0:5:50,57
people-- he specifically talked
about people who were


159
0:5:50,57 --> 0:5:52,79
spreading rumors on the internet
that are not true.


160
0:5:52,79 --> 0:5:54,56
They are true, Bill, OK?


161
0:5:54,56 --> 0:5:55,63
They're in my books.


162
0:5:55,63 --> 0:5:56,94
There's documentaries
about it.


163
0:5:56,94 --> 0:5:57,63
They're true.


164
0:5:57,63 --> 0:5:58,85
Go away.


165
0:5:58,85 --> 0:6:0,9
Drink your milk.


166
0:6:0,9 --> 0:6:5,48
[MUSIC PLAYING]


167
0:6:5,48 --> 0:6:7,8
KEVIN MORPURGO: Do people just
turn up at your door, though?


168
0:6:7,8 --> 0:6:8,84
I'm sure you have fans that--


169
0:6:8,84 --> 0:6:10,43
DAVID ICKE: Well, they do.


170
0:6:10,43 --> 0:6:11,32
I hope they're not fans.


171
0:6:11,32 --> 0:6:13,65
I hope they're not followers,
or they're not listening.


172
0:6:13,65 --> 0:6:17,91
But yeah, I have people come
quite a lot from time to time.


173
0:6:17,91 --> 0:6:20,84
I'm a very private
person, you see.


174
0:6:20,84 --> 0:6:22,87
It's one of the strange things
about my life, really.


175
0:6:22,87 --> 0:6:25,5
I'd guess you'd call it a
paradox, but I don't suppose


176
0:6:25,5 --> 0:6:26,61
it is, really.


177
0:6:26,61 --> 0:6:30,18
And that's that almost
everything I've done in my


178
0:6:30,18 --> 0:6:31,9
life has been a public
profession.


179
0:6:31,9 --> 0:6:33,77
I was a footballer.


180
0:6:33,77 --> 0:6:35,77
Then I became a journalist
and television presenter.


181
0:6:35,77 --> 0:6:37,62
Then I was a national spokesman
for the Green Party.


182
0:6:37,62 --> 0:6:39,78
Then I did this, of course.


183
0:6:39,78 --> 0:6:42,2
And yet I'm an incredibly
private person.


184
0:6:42,2 --> 0:6:45,41
And I talk to thousands at
an event, and I love it.


185
0:6:45,41 --> 0:6:47,57
I just love being there.


186
0:6:47,57 --> 0:6:48,77
It's like being in
another reality.


187
0:6:48,77 --> 0:6:53,6
There's a massive interaction
going on energetically between


188
0:6:53,6 --> 0:6:54,6
the audience and me.


189
0:6:54,6 --> 0:6:58,73
You feel what humanity is behind
the programming and


190
0:6:58,73 --> 0:7:4,312
behind the false sense
of limitation, and I


191
0:7:4,312 --> 0:7:6,35
Can't and Little Me.


192
0:7:6,35 --> 0:7:10,7
You feel the true magnitude
of what we are


193
0:7:10,7 --> 0:7:11,6
coming off the audience.


194
0:7:11,6 --> 0:7:14,27
What we need is not
compliance.


195
0:7:14,27 --> 0:7:19,37
We need a non-comply dance,
where we beat to a different


196
0:7:19,37 --> 0:7:22,14
drum and we dance to
a different drum.


197
0:7:22,14 --> 0:7:26,19
Where we refuse to acquiesce
to this control system that


198
0:7:26,19 --> 0:7:29,91
seeks to enslave us even more
than it already has.


199
0:7:29,91 --> 0:7:32,73
Non-comply dance.


200
0:7:32,73 --> 0:7:33,57
Do this.


201
0:7:33,57 --> 0:7:35,76
Comply.


202
0:7:35,76 --> 0:7:37,3
No.


203
0:7:37,3 --> 0:7:38,77
No.


204
0:7:38,77 --> 0:7:39,95
Enough.

0:7:39,95 --> 0:7:41,4
It's time to fly.


206
0:7:41,4 --> 0:7:43,75
It's time to fly.


207
0:7:43,75 --> 0:7:45,14
Thank you very much.

DAVID ICKE: Thank you.


210
0:7:49,85 --> 0:7:51,35
It's funny, Kev, you know.


211
0:7:51,35 --> 0:7:55,85
You brought me here, and it's
kind of a real strange,


212
0:7:55,85 --> 0:7:59,99
spooky, surreal feeling, because
I used to stand here.


213
0:7:59,99 --> 0:8:0,69
I was a little boy.


214
0:8:0,69 --> 0:8:3,11
I could just about see over the
top of this bloody fence.


215
0:8:3,11 --> 0:8:4,6
Same fence.


216
0:8:4,6 --> 0:8:6,42
Think it is, anyway,
repainted.


217
0:8:6,42 --> 0:8:8,31
And I used to watch the
steam trains come up.


218
0:8:8,31 --> 0:8:12,75
And I wanted to be a footballer
and I wanted--


219
0:8:12,75 --> 0:8:14,92
I love steam trains and
all the rest of it.


220
0:8:14,92 --> 0:8:20,28
And nearly 60 years later, I'm
standing in the same spot and


221
0:8:20,28 --> 0:8:23,1
I've been talking to you about
a moon bloody matrix,


222
0:8:23,1 --> 0:8:25,43
shape-shifting reptilians,
a few families


223
0:8:25,43 --> 0:8:26,63
run the bloody world.


224
0:8:26,63 --> 0:8:30,67
I mean, whatever happened
to you?


225
0:8:30,67 --> 0:8:32,72
Just keep watching
the steam trains.


226
0:8:32,72 --> 0:8:35,13
Look at the trouble you've
got me into.


227
0:8:35,13 --> 0:8:37,28
And it's just as strange,
where life goes.


228
0:8:37,28 --> 0:8:39,34
You never know where it goes,
so all you can do


229
0:8:39,34 --> 0:8:40,52
is enjoy the moment.


230
0:8:40,52 --> 0:8:43,429
And I love this moment, this
moment when I was watching


231
0:8:43,429 --> 0:8:46,74
those steam trains, I
was in my heaven.


232
0:8:46,74 --> 0:8:49,4
And standing here, I'm in
another kind of heaven,


233
0:8:49,4 --> 0:8:53,79
because given what happened
20 years ago and


234
0:8:53,79 --> 0:8:54,85
many years after that--


235
0:8:54,85 --> 0:8:59,9
I was ridiculed in the street,
called a nutter, and I


236
0:8:59,9 --> 0:9:0,35
couldn't fill a phone box.


237
0:9:0,35 --> 0:9:2,8
And now, suddenly, it's
so different.


238
0:9:2,8 --> 0:9:6,25
It just shows that if you keep
walking, and keep walking,


239
0:9:6,25 --> 0:9:8,73
believing what you're doing,
then something comes


240
0:9:8,73 --> 0:9:9,56
out the other end.


241
0:9:9,56 --> 0:9:12,87
And it's just beginning to.


242
0:9:12,87 --> 0:9:14,94
KEVIN MORPURGO: Even within
conspiracy circles, David Icke


243
0:9:14,94 --> 0:9:17,4
is a controversial figure.


244
0:9:17,4 --> 0:9:19,45
Many view him as a harmless
eccentric, while others claim


245
0:9:19,45 --> 0:9:21,66
he must be an agent provocateur,
discrediting


246
0:9:21,66 --> 0:9:24,7
conspiracies by mixing
documented fact with wild


247
0:9:24,7 --> 0:9:26,13
allegations of rapist
reptilians and their


248
0:9:26,13 --> 0:9:28,82
artificial moon base.


249
0:9:28,82 --> 0:9:30,23
Maybe they're just jealous.


250
0:9:30,23 --> 0:9:32,94
Icke has sold over 20 million
books worldwide, while his


251
0:9:32,94 --> 0:9:35,96
website is an iconic forum for
the global esoteric community,


252
0:9:35,96 --> 0:9:39,12
with over four million
views a month.


253
0:9:39,12 --> 0:9:40,88
So this is David Icke--


254
0:9:40,88 --> 0:9:43,8
visionary, multimillion-selling
author,


255
0:9:43,8 --> 0:9:47,85
global icon, one-time messiah,
former goalkeeper, and the


256
0:9:47,85 --> 0:9:50,92
single greatest threat to
the lizard apocalypse.


257
0:9:50,92 --> 0:9:52,5
Good luck, my friend.
