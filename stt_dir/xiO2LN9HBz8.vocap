###7 STEVE RODRIGUEZ: My favorite thing is skating down the
###8 street, you know what I mean?
###9 Just hitting things random here and there.
###11 If the spots are like 23rd Street, it's like, why are you
###13 going to drive there?
###15 The best part is skating to the spot.
###17 At any given time, you'll be skating,
###21 and it's always different.
###22 It's just completely random chaos what's going on.
###26 And you're just meshing with that environment.
###28 It's just such a spontaneous experience,
###31 skating in the city.
###33 It's that old saying.
###33 It's not the destination.
###35 It's the journey.
###35 It's like totally true.
###38 O'Dell, one of the best spots.
###40 Come on, stay with me.
###42 Come come, come.
###44 Follow me, fast.
###45 
###51 PATRICK O'DELL: I will come back to "Epicly Later'd." This
###53 show is about Steve Rodriguez.
###55 Steve is one of those die-hard skaters I've ever come across
###59 in my entire life.
###60 And to me, he is exactly the kind of person that you want
###64 to be owning skateboard companies.
###66 So Steve Rodriguez, he runs 5boro.
###68 It's a small company.
###69 They don't run ads.
###70 They're independently owned.
###72 But they've made such a big name for themselves just on
###76 the grassroots level by always having the best local skaters,
###80 and the best up and coming people.
###82 Over time, his team has had some of the biggest names in
###85 the East Coast.
###86 5boro's a company that's just about skateboarding.
###88 He's just in it for the right reasons.
###90 
###93 STEVE RODRIGUEZ: I've been skating since around 1983.
###95 I moved to New York.
###97 And I've been here since.
###98 I've been doing 5boro 11 years.
###101 I came up with the idea to--
###104 I want to make a company.
###105 I want to make a company that represents what we're about.
###109 It's just a totally different structure of a company.
###114 Like I'd say, 25% of 5boro's job is working with the City
###119 of New York to make sure that skateboarding is represented
###122 well in New York City, dealing with parks and places to
###125 skate, things like that.
###127 So it's more than just a company that makes boards.
###131 The city, two years ago, the city wanted to renovate all
###136 downtown parks.
###137 And this is one of the parks downtown.
###138 They said, because a lot of kids skate here, the only
###141 skate area was actually going to be this pathway
###143 right here on top.
###144 That's it.
###144 So everything else was going to be taken out.
###147 We got involved, went to the council meetings, talked to
###150 the people and said, they're bitching how stuff's going to
###154 cost so much money, this and that, and the other thing.
###155 And you guys know no one would hang out down
###158 here besides skaters.
###159 Because it's under a bridge.
###160 It's dirty, blah, blah, blah.
###162 The city, two years ago, the city wanted to renovate all
###166 downtown parks.
###167 So they said, OK, well, we're going to take
###171 out the little banks.
###172 And it sucks.
###173 Because that's where all history really is about, the
###175 Brooklyn banks.
###176 It's at the small banks.
###178 And I don't know.
###179 I mean, this area's fun.
###181 But if you've ever skated over there, it was sick.
###183 Because it was a hip, like a wave, not a flat bank.
###185 
###191 MALE SPEAKER: Oh, my God, I'm fucking perfect.
###195 STEVE RODRIGUEZ: If you're just in New York City,
###197 everybody has to go to the banks or whatever.
###199 Because you would definitely go to EMB, if it was still
###203 there, even if you couldn't skate there.
###206 Because I remember going there when you couldn't skate there.
###208 And you'd just see people there anyway.
###209 Because it's EMB, you know what I mean?
###212 A lot of kids, oh, I want to go to Love Park, even though
###214 they know they probably won't be able to skate there--
###216 Freedom Plaza, Pulaski in D.C. There's all these holy grail
###220 places that you're just going to go because it's history.
###223 It's like going to see the pyramids, if you're a tourist
###226 or whatever, and you go to Egypt.
###227 It's something you have to see.
###228 
###246 This is the Harold thing where I remember seeing Harold
###250 skating here, hauling over this black rail, off this
###253 thing, down to the bottom.
###255 I could swear he was doing it for money once.
###259 Just joking around, but at the same time taking the money.
###262 But there used to be a guy that would jump the garbage
###264 cans here, back when they were the wire mesh.
###268 That's pretty sick.
###269 I mean, that's like one of the first things, like that's when
###271 I was like 10 years old or whatever.
###273 Seeing that shit, and you're just like damn.
###275 But this was a super--
###280 I'd say, late '80s, early '90s--
###283 people would skate this area right here.
###285 I don't know, this was like a, for a minute, this was--
###289 I don't know, for a good like three years probably or more,
###292 everybody used to stay here, these ledges.
###294 These were actually-- you could skate them.
###295 They're like so chunked now.
###298 I just remember coming into the city seeing so
###300 much shit go down.
###301 This is actually--
###302 I met Gonz right there.
###304 This is the first place I ever met Mark Gonzales.
###307 I remember we were just skating down Fifth Avenue.
###310 And there was--
###311 it was more crowded than today.
###312 There was some event going on.
###314 And just seeing him skate right here was--
###316 you're just so blown away.
###317 You're like fuck, that's Mark Gonzales.
###319 
###322 Look at this shit.
###324 I know someone's ollied into this.
###327 I think front-side 180, but I think there's
###329 was a back-side 180--
###330 Grosso will probably know-- into the fountain.
###332 That's pretty sick.
###335 Even by today's standards, that's sick.
###338 Actually when Lenny Kirk and Anthony Correa came to New
###341 York, I remember taking them around to spots.
###345 And those two just like seriously, like destroying
###349 everything.
###350 
###352 This shit's fun, dude.
###354 And you could tell us it's skated because
###355 look it's fresh paint.
###357 See, look, see.
###358 Get the security guy.
###362 You mean we really can't skateboard here.
###364 [INAUDIBLE]
###365 STEVE RODRIGUEZ: Ah, I'm bummed, man.
###367 I came all the way from New Jersey.
###370 Anyway, this is a fuckin' sick spot.
###373 And I don't know.
###374 That guy's not there at night.
###375 I don't usually come here this early.
###377 But just front-boarding this whole thing, or trying to
###381 front-board the whole thing, it's sick.
###382 There's a new sidewalk.
###383 I know when Harold did this shit, when he 50-50'ed it--
###385 which is pretty sick, because if you flip
###387 over, you get killed.
###389 But the sidewalk was rough.
###390 It was like that.
###392 
###397 Yo, I've never seen footage of someone doing this this way.
###400 Have you?
###400 PATRICK O'DELL: You mean, over?
###401 STEVE RODRIGUEZ: Yeah, this way?
###402 No.
###403 But I either saw it in person or saw it in a video.
###406 Someone ollied from here into there--
###409 Anthony Correa.
###409 That's sick.
###410 Get up here, O'Dell.
###411 Check this out.
###412 Yo, but he ollied from here into that shit.
###416 That's asking for some fuckin' teeth, fuckin' to be removed.
###419 This is fuckin' sketchy.
###421 You want to check out the other gap over there?
###423 
###426 I don't, dude.
###426 This fuckin' ground is so shitty.
###429 It's pretty sick.
###429 But, you know what I mean?
###430 It's just another one of those spots where it's just because
###432 of the way it's set up.
###433 It looks cool.
###434 Whatever, this is sick.
###436 I don't think I ever ollied this.
###438 And I don't think I ever will.
###439 
###442 So we're all old.
###443 We don't just jump down.
###444 Take the stairs.
###445 
###457 So weird.
###458 
###460 Yo, O'Dell, I hope you got that guy.
###461 
###464 Damn.
###466 So I don't know.
###466 So this is Union Square.
###468 There was like a time when Union Square was a place to
###471 skate, two sets of steps here.
###474 I remember my board--
###476 trying to front side 360.
###477 And my board smacking me in the face so
###479 hard, it made a hole.
###481 Like I actually had to get stitches to close
###483 a hole right here.
###484 And back then it wasn't like now nowadays.
###487 You never come and well, let's skate these steps.
###491 This shit was so waxed up.
###493 And it was one of the only curves, like little curves.
###499 John Carter doing slappies on this just like super Hamilton.
###504 Like all those guys that roll through here skate this stuff.
###507 You'd see people actually grind both like this.
###511 I don't know.
###511 This place was fun, dude.
###514 Over here, O'Dell.
###516 So you want to talk about Burton Smith's
###518 destruction of this?
###520 This is like 32 inches high.
###523 The ground was smooth, whatever.
###525 But it's still stick.
###526 I think he fakey ollied it this, half cabbed it, maybe
###529 switch 180'ed.
###531 He might have even pop shoveled this.
###533 He's so good.
###534 That kid was like killing it at that time.
###538 And I know Gangemi--
###539 should we go to the other side?
###540 
###546 But you know the famous Robb Gangemi?
###549 He board slid this shit over these little nipples.
###552 It's very sick.
###553 So actually the most spot for advanced people was over here,
###558 this round ledge.
###559 You remember skating this shit back here?
###561 
###564 Anyway, this was sick, this ledge, this
###566 round ledge right here--
###567 doing back flips around this, just like tail
###571 slides, all that shit.
###571 This definitely was sick.
###573 To me, this is like a legit spot, where it was fun.
###576 And a lot of people filmed shit here.
###579 Underneath here when it would rain, a lot of people would go
###581 down to the subway.
###582 And there was kind of like a ramp, like a walking ramp.
###585 But it was super wide.
###586 It was the whole hallway.
###587 And people used to just skate and set up shit and
###589 do ollies and stuff.
###591 I don't know, it was fun when it was raining.
###594 You remember the second coming of Union Square, when they
###596 redid this park right here?
###598 So everybody came back to Union Square to skate.
###602 But there was really nothing else, nothing new to skate.
###604 They just extended the sidewalk.
###608 This spot was--
###609 it was good for a while because it was all that
###610 construction material.
###611 You know what I mean?
###612 And then when they finished, it was good for a while.
###615 But let's go check it out.
###617 I mean, they used to come down off the steps, and then
###619 probably to where this large circular pattern was.
###624 That was actually the street.
###626 So I remember some crazy BMX guy, Brendan Kennedy actually
###631 bunny-hopped off the steps into the street, which is,
###635 seriously, 20 fuckin' feet or something like that.
###638 It was kind of impossible.
###640 Damn, I can't believe this guy did it.
###641 I saw him do it.
###641 I was like, damn, that's sick.
###643 You ever get my message about that kid I heard.
###645 I was in the middle of nowhere.
###647 And he said, something about, you go latered?
###649 You ever get my message?
###650 PATRICK O'DELL: Yeah, yeah.
###651 STEVE RODRIGUEZ: Dude, I was fuckin' dyin'.
###652 
###658 A lot of people skateboard here, sir?
###661 No, I'm saying, do a lot of people try to though?
###663 SECURITY GUARD: They try to.
###664 But they don't allow that here.
###667 Because that's the guy that runs the building.
###669 STEVE RODRIGUEZ: The boss.
###670 The boss with his ladies.
###672 Hey, hey, check it out--
###673 Epic.
###675 We got an Epic pin.
###676 It's a pin that says Epic, dude.
###677 That's awesome.
###678 
###688 This is another little gap right here, over the stairs
###692 and over the fence, quote unquote, something you'd see
###695 in a magazine in California.
###696 You know what I mean?
###697 But it actually was here, and you could skate here.
###699 First 5boro video, Mike Peterson has that shit.
###702 He does front side 180 and the other [INAUDIBLE].
###705 Over that way?
###706 
###711 That's a good opening, like the cube, the biggest non-spot
###714 spot there is.
###717 Or there was.
###719 At the time, this was like the TF.
###722 It's like the default spot to go, doing
###724 manuals on six-inch curbs.
###725 
###735 This curb had more, has been [INAUDIBLE]
###738 more than anything.
###740 It sucked, too, because it had this lip on it
###743 that you locked in.
###744 But you probably had to slide the whole thing in
###746 order to get out.
###747 If you really think about it, it's just really more like--
###750 it's not really the tricks.
###751 It's just like, oh, shit, that's in New York City.
###754 I mean right away that gives it so much more validity
###757 Harold had some lines here just doing manuals, It's just
###761 I'll admit I backflipped it a couple times with the cool
###764 guys in the background.
###766 
###771 Nah, there's plenty of places to skate besides this place.
###774 A lot of people can watch you here.
###776 It's just kind of like a hang-out spot.
###778 A perfect example is what is the real reason people stopped
###782 skating at the Brooklyn banks?
###784 It's because they put that fence on the wall.
###785 And you could no longer sit there.
###787 So at the time, all the people that used to go down there and
###790 sit on the wall, there was no longer a spot.
###792 Because they couldn't sit there.
###793 Here there's plenty of room to sit.
###794 So it's just people wanting to get associated with that, the
###799 New York experience, and skating in New York City.
###802 And I don't know.
###807 When you think about it, so much of
###810 that footage is awesome.
###811 It's classic to see people skating at an old spot back in
###815 the day, this and that.
###817 But was the skating really up to par?
###821 I don't know.
###822 Was it?
###822 Was it not just the same shit?
###824 I don't know.
###826 If it was really a good spot, why aren't people
###828 skating here right now?
###829 
###831 Am I being pretty negative here, O'Dell?
###834 I'm not.
###835 It's just more like reality, dude.
###836
