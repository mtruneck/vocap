###1 STEVE SPANGLER: So we're here at the
###3 Warner Brothers Studios.
###4 This is the home of the Ellen set.
###6 Don't move, don't move.
###7 Here it comes.
###8 Here it comes.
###9 Ahh.
###9 Turn it upside down, put it in the water.
###12 So I bet you think this is the part of the show, where I'm
###14 going to say, don't try these experiments at home.
###17 And you're right, except there is one experiment
###19 we want you to try.
###20 Just look for the graphic that's right here
###22 that says try it.
###23 That's your signal that you can try that
###25 experiment at home.
###26 Everything else, off limits.
###27 Look, I've already given you homework, and the show hasn't
###30 even started.
###31 I'm Steve Spangler and I'm all about making science fun.
###34 For the last 20 years I've been teaching ways to turn
###37 ordinary science experiments into unforgettable learning
###40 experiences.
###41 I have an amazing team, who will do whatever it takes to
###44 affect the way people think about science.
###47 And to do that, I live by one motto--
###49 make it big, do it right, give it class.
###52 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###58 Well, we're here at DIA, we are ready to go
###60 to the Ellen Show.
###61 It's a quick trip to Burbank.
###62 And now it's my job to just practice the demos.
###65 So I figure I'll just flip down the tray table and
###67 practice the demos that I'm going to do on the show.
###70 I actually am her bodyguard, I'm Carly's bodyguard.
###73 I speak into my arm.
###74 Sector one clear, sector one clear.
###76 And I just make sure that everything is fine.
###78 I always accompany her like this, like she is a criminal.
###80 Usually I have to take her hands.
###82 The other thing is we've learned how
###83 to merge into traffic.
###85 So there's a correct way to walk and a
###87 correct way not to walk.
###88 You'd better turn around, because you're
###89 going to fall in.
###90 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###103 All right, we're here at the airport.
###105 And, I think, I've got all the demos figured out for the
###106 Ellen Show because of good friend here, Lopez.
###109 All right.
###109 So he and I have discussed this, and we know exactly what
###113 we're going to do on the Ellen Show.
###115 Tell them what we're going to do.
###117 LOPEZ: Well, I'm going to wait and everybody
###119 else will see later.
###120 STEVE SPANGLER: That's right, see he's a consummate
###122 professional, because he knows you don't tell the
###124 demos ahead of time.
###125 You've got to tell me the demo.
###127 But when you think of it , you tell me.
###128 Because I've--
###129 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###139 So here we are in lovely California.
###140 And I didn't realize this, but look at the Hollywood sign.
###143 It is so much smaller in person.
###146 And it's so big on TV.
###147 But look at those letters right there.
###149 And right now, I think that it would be a good idea for me to
###151 climb up in there and I'm just going to--
###153 AIRPORT PORTER: Sir, it's time for you to go.
###154 Please.
###155 STEVE SPANGLER: But I just wanted to see the sign.
###156 AIRPORT PORTER: Well, you see it, sir.
###158 Time for you to go.
###159 STEVE SPANGLER: OK, But I just wanted to see the sign.
###161 I just wanted--
###164 Whenever we do the Ellen Show, this is the time in the
###167 morning, when we sit down and go through notes.
###168 So we do have notes.
###171 So going to kind of go through all the demos, and just make
###174 sure that everything is set, and so forth.
###175 And then, I'm sitting here at the table with Carly and Jeff,
###178 and there's a ton of science stuff that you can do.
###182 Anything that you can find around you.
###184 So look what I've got.
###184 A little diaper time.
###186 If you can find yourself a diaper, you have all the
###189 makings of a great little experiment.
###191 Believe it or not, the secret that makes these diapers super
###194 absorbent is this polymer that's inside.
###197 So you are going to have to give me a couple minutes here.
###199 But you rip open the diaper, and then you kind of get the
###202 polymer out.
###204 Ah.
###205 See, you can start to even see it coming out here.
###207 Watch this.
###209 See the powder that's coming out?
###211 That powder is the polymer that is super absorbent.
###218 OK, watch.
###218 So this goes into a cup.
###220 Here, we won't use all of it.
###224 Perfect.
###224 Watch this.
###225 Here is this water, watch.
###228 So here's what makes it super absorbent.
###229 Watch, three, two, one.
###233 Isn't that awesome?
###234 So this is the material that's in the diaper that causes it
###237 to become super absorbent.
###239 It's a polymer that absorbs about 500 times
###241 its weight in water.
###242 So you can hide this, for example, in the bottom of one
###246 of these cups.
###248 OK, see these cups here?
###249 They're perfect.
###250 So you just put this in the bottom of a cup.
###255 OK.
###255 And so here's that powder.
###257 See, it's hiding here.
###258 So not this one goes on top, a this one's here.
###260 And nobody knows it's there.
###262 Now you just have to find somebody to
###263 play along with you.
###265 Look, it's Jack.
###266 Jack manages the club up here.
###267 And we've made kind of a mess, but I want to show you
###270 something cool.
###270 And disregard most of this.
###272 And the fact when you do this and you open
###274 this up, it goes tah-dah.
###275 Like this, see?
###276 This is a defect in the bottle.
###278 There are actually holes in the bottle like that.
###280 And that was her idea, so that's her problem.
###283 But here, let me show you this.
###284 This is very cool.
###285 All right, so have you ever seen the three shell game?
###287 JACK: Sure.
###288 STEVE SPANGLER: You know where you put the pea in one.
###289 OK, so watch this.
###291 You put the water here.
###293 OK, now.
###294 Here's what I'm going to do.
###294 I'm going to move them around.
###296 And you tell me where it is.
###298 Oops, it's not in that one.
###299 JACK: Yeah.
###300 STEVE SPANGLER: OK?
###300 All right.
###300 So you're ready?
###301 JACK: Aha.
###301 STEVE SPANGLER: All right, watch this.
###302 It's going to be good.
###303 OK, here we go.
###305 OK, where is it?
###306 In the middle one, left one, or right?
###307 Whoa, see you're watching pretty closely.
###311 OK, I'm going to give you a hint this time, ready?
###312 It's not in this one.
###314 You ready?
###315 Oh look, Elvis.
###316 STEVE SPANGLER: All right, so now where do you think it is?
###318 Left, middle or right?
###320 Ah, see you're watching very, very, very closely.
###322 All right, so this one here, I'm going to give you, OK, you
###325 know where it is.
###326 OK, ready?
###327 Here we go.
###328 Right here.
###329 Right here.
###330 See, it's not in this, so I did that on purpose.
###332 Ready?
###332 I'm doing this whole switcheroo like this.
###334 Where do you think it is?
###335 Nope, not in this one, but that's a good guess.
###337 OK, so now.
###338 Are you ready to keep going?
###339 Here we go.
###339 Here and here.
###341 Now where do you think it is?
###342 JACK: The middle.
###343 STEVE SPANGLER: OK, not in the middle.
###344 No.
###345 OK, keep going.
###346 Right here, and here.
###347 Where you think it is?
###348 JACK: The middle.
###349 STEVE SPANGLER: OK, that was close.
###351 Watch this one.
###352 See the water's gone.
###354 It's gone.
###354 Tah-dah.
###355 JACK: Wow.
###356 STEVE SPANGLER: See is that cool?
###358 JACK: How did--
###358 you're not going to tell me.
###359 But, wow, that was great.
###360 STEVE SPANGLER: When you weren't looking, I just went
###361 ah, and I drank it.
###363 It was perfect.
###365 JACK: Get out of here.
###365 STEVE SPANGLER: See?
###365 That's awesome.
###366 JACK: That was very, very good.
###368 Very impressive.
###368 STEVE SPANGLER: Thanks, man.
###369 Very cool.
###369 There you go, now next time you see a diaper--
###372 see it's a science of a diaper.
###373 All right, cool.
###374 And, now you know.
###376 See how cool is this to be able to do all of this.
###378 We are ready to go.
###379 We'll head to the studios here in just a couple minutes.
###382 And nothing that we did this morning will be on the show.
###384 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###390 STEVE SPANGLER: Well, here we are backstage
###391 at the Ellen Show.
###392 Not everybody gets to see this backstage area at the show.
###395 We are getting ready for the big finale, so we're using
###397 this big, huge swimming pool.
###400 And logistically, you know, you've got to work on things
###402 about how things are going to move in and out of the show.
###404 So, these are the pros that know how to make it work.
###406 I just stand here and wait for them to say go, and we'll head
###409 into rehearsal.
###410 So, I think we've got the cannon pressure set.
###412 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###418 STEVE SPANGLER: Look at this.
###420 This is nerd fest over here.
###421 Do you see this?
###422 See, she has to have a little gun to make sure that the
###425 temperature is OK.
###426 It's ice water.
###427 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###433 STEVE SPANGLER: One of the things I've learned from the
###435 people here at the Ellen Show is not to telegraph things to
###438 the audience.
###439 So normally, as a teacher, I'd just have
###440 everything sitting out there.
###441 But what I've learned is how important it is to keep things
###443 as kind of a secret.
###444 So, when it's ready and they say go, and they open the
###447 doors, everything kind of gets moved into place, and the
###449 audience gets that real reaction.
###450 The other thing that you have to know is that Ellen doesn't
###454 want to see anything that has to happen with the science
###456 experiments ahead of time, so we keep things as shielded
###459 from her as possible.
###460 So it's completely a surprise when she gets to see it.
###462 So when she's seeing it for the first time, it's just like
###465 the audience seeing it for the first time.
###467 It just means we've got to practice a lot internally,
###469 making sure that we're OK.
###471 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###481 STEVE SPANGLER: All right, it's go time.
###482 Let's see how it goes.
###484 Back this way.
###485 See you.
###488 ELLEN: I have safety glasses ready and I have the fire
###492 marshal standing by.
###493 And that can only mean one thing.
###495 Please welcome our science guy, Steve Spangler.
###497 [APPLAUSE]
###504 STEVE SPANGLER: How are you?
###504 ELLEN: Oh I'm good.
###505 How are you?
###507 STEVE SPANGLER: I'm great.
###507 ELLEN: I never like to know what's happening.
###509 I like to be surprised with everybody else.
###511 So what are we doing today?
###512 STEVE SPANGLER: My socks are from JC Penney's.
###514 ELLEN: Thank you very much.
###515 Thank you.
###516 
###519 Thank you.
###520 STEVE SPANGLER: So I'm fascinated with pendulums.
###521 I don't know about this, but you probably
###523 are too, aren't you?
###524 ELLEN: Sure.
###524 STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah.
###524 So, maybe it's just the swinging repetitive motion.
###527 Maybe I have nothing to do in my life.
###529 But it's--
###529 I like that.
###530 And so I was thinking why don't we do
###532 something with a pendulum.
###532 And so look, it's a bowling ball attached to a
###534 great big huge rope.
###535 Come here, this will be fun.
###536 If I pull it back, and add some energy to it, like when
###539 you're pushing a kid on the playground, you know swinging
###541 the kid, you can make them go higher than how you started.
###543 ELLEN: OK.
###544 STEVE SPANGLER: Which could be dangerous.
###544 ELLEN: Yes.
###545 STEVE SPANGLER: Right?
###545 So that's why I have the stand-in right over here.
###548 This is Mellon.
###549 ELLEN: Hi, Mellon.
###550 STEVE SPANGLER: And, Mellon meet Ellen.
###552 
###554 Awkward.
###554 ELLEN: And how do you know it's going to
###555 come exactly back?
###557 STEVE SPANGLER: I don't.
###557 I just saw this on the Internet.
###558 ELLEN: I see.
###560 STEVE SPANGLER: This is what I was thinking is I want you to
###561 stand in the place of Mellon, OK?
###563 ELLEN: No.
###564 So, it's fine.
###566 You don't have to worry about that at all.
###567 ELLEN: I'm not going to do that.
###568 STEVE SPANGLER: But if you had a friend who wanted to?
###570 Lauren, come on out here.
###571 
###574 STEVE SPANGLER: Ah, this is so awesome.
###575 So if you stand right here like this, I'm going to go get
###577 the bowling ball.
###578 I'll be right back, OK?
###579 All right, so now watch.
###581 If I bring this right--
###582 LAUREN: Oh boy.
###582 STEVE SPANGLER: --to your face, like this.
###584 Let's see it to your nose.
###585 See how it's touching right there.
###586 And then I let go, it should not come back and hit you.
###588 Now if you move, it could be dangerous.
###590 So that's why this wall is going to come in behind you.
###592 All right, so here we go.
###593 Watch this.
###594 Bring in the wall.
###595 Keep coming.
###595 Keep coming.
###596 LAUREN: Thank you so much.
###596 It's been great.
###596 Thank you for having me.
###596 STEVE SPANGLER: Keep the-- right there, oh it's perfect.
###598 So now, I'm going to bring it right to your nose,
###601 and it'll be great.
###601 All right.
###602 And this is for me, just in case, because I have more
###606 experiments to do, all right?
###608 Drum roll, please.
###609 
###611 Here it goes.
###612 Don't move.
###613 Don't move.
###614 Here it comes.
###615 Here it comes.
###616 Ahh.
###617 See, you're fine.
###618 Everything was great.
###622 Let's here it for Lauren.
###623 [APPLAUSE]
###625 STEVE SPANGLER: What I was thinking was is there another
###626 way to crush a can that would be better?
###628 And this is it, all right?
###629 So I've taken the cans here, these cans.
###631 And I put a little bit of water into each of the cans.
###633 So I'm cooking them on our little stove here.
###636 If we turn it upside down into this colder water that's here,
###638 you're going to allow the air pressure to crush the can.
###640 All right, so which one do you want Sprite or Coke?
###642 Which one?
###642 ELLEN: I'll take Sprite.
###643 STEVE SPANGLER: Bingo.
###644 All right, so now you're going to pick up like this, hold it
###645 like this, and turn it upside down, and
###647 put it into the water.
###648 ELLEN: All right.
###648 STEVE SPANGLER: Turn it upside down, put it in the water.
###650 That was a nice one.
###651 Look at that power that's there.
###652 ELLEN: Wow.
###652 That's amazing.
###653 STEVE SPANGLER: But I was thinking, this is your big
###655 show, and you would never allow just that to happen.
###657 So when I was thinking, I thought what if we did it with
###659 a 55-gallon steel drum, all right?
###663 Because who doesn't want to crush one those?
###665 ELLEN: Everyone needs to.
###666 STEVE SPANGLER: Look at this set up here.
###667 This is going to be really great.
###668 ELLEN: Ah, yep.
###669 STEVE SPANGLER: So here's what we have going here.
###671 We have a 55-gallon steel drum.
###674 As he caps it off now, no more air inside, just that steam.
###677 And the molecules are going to go from 1,700 times farther
###680 away from each other then close by.
###681 And see the swimming pool?
###682 Some cold water.
###684 Jeff, will you pour some water on it for me?
###686 So now, watch this, where you just have the air pressure
###688 pushing on it.
###690 And now it's condensing down, and now-- the weird thing--
###693 [LOUD POP]
###695 Isn't that awesome?
###697 Come here, it' s OK now, it's OK.
###701 Listen, listen, listen.
###703 ELLEN: All right, well let's--
###704 [CLUNKING NOISE]
###708 STEVE SPANGLER: See how it's working?
###709 It's just kind of crushing.
###710 The same kind of thing that we're trying to do to get kids
###712 excited, whether it's online or on YouTube, or any other
###714 way they we're doing it.
###715 ELLEN: Well it's always a lot of fun, Steve.
###716 Go to our website to learn more about Steve and his new
###719 YouTube show, the Spangler Effect.
###721 We'll be right back.
###722 Steve Spangler.
###722 [APPLAUSE]
###732 STEVE SPANGLER: It crushed.
###733 Bam, and we got it down.
###735 And the bowling ball didn't smack her in the face.
###737 I say it's good.
