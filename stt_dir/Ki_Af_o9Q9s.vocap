###5 Adam Steltzner 'When people look at it...  uhhh, it looks crazy. That's a very natural thing.'
###13 'Sometimes when we look at it, it looks crazy.'
###18 'It is the result of reasoned, engineering thought.'
###25 'But it still looks crazy.'
###28 'From the top of the atmosphere, down to the surface-'
###32 'It takes us seven minutes.'
###34 'It takes 14 minutes or so for the signal from the spacecraft to make it to Earth-'
###42 ' that's how far Mars is away from us.'
###46 'So, when we first get word that we've touched the top of the atmosphere,'
###53 'the vehicle has been alive...' (music intensifies- heavier percussion)
###55 'or dead, on the surface, for at least seven minutes.' (music crescendos- dark pounding drums)
###67 Tom Rivellini: 'Entry, descent and landing, also known as EDL, is referred to as the '7 minutes of terror'.'
###72 'Because we've got literally seven minutes to get from the top of the atmosphere to the surface of Mars-'
###81 'going from 13,000 miles an hour to zero, in perfect sequence, perfect choreography, perfect timing...'
###86 'and the computer has to do it all by itself, with no help from the ground.'
###91 'If any one thing doesn't work just right, it's game over.'
###95 (whoosh) (music -tension/drums steadily building)
###97 Adam Steltzner: 'We slam into the atmosphere and develop so much aerodynamic drag,'
###101 'our heat shield, it heats up and it glows like the surface of the sun.'
###105 '1600 degrees!'
###109 Miguel San Martin: 'During entry, the vehicle is not only slowing down- violently, though the atmosphere,'
###114 'but also we are guiding it, like an airplane! to be able to land in a very narrow, constrained space.'
###122 'This is one of the biggest challenges that we are facing, and one that we have never attempted at Mars.'
###129 Tom Rivellini: 'Mars- it's actually really hard to slow down,'
###132 'because it has just enough atmosphere, that you have to deal with it-'
###135 'otherwise, it will destroy your spacecraft.'
###137 'On the other hand, it doesnt have enough atmosphere to finish the job.'
###143 'We're still going about 1000 miles an hour.'
###145 'So at that point we use a parachute.'
###148 Anita Sengupta: 'The parachute is the largest and strongest super-sonic parachute-'
###152 'that we've ever built to date.'
###153 'It has to withstand 65,000 pounds of force! even though the parachute itself only weighs about 100 pounds.'
###160 (blast-whoosh)
###164 Tom Rivellini: 'When it opens up that fast, it's a neck-snapping 9G's!'
###169 Steve Lee: 'At that point we have to get that heat shield off.'
###171 'It's like a big lens cap, blocking our view of the ground to the radar.'
###175 'The radar has to take just the right altitude and velocity measurements at just the right time-'
###180 'or the rest of the landing sequence wont work.'
###182 (heavy wind sound) (music pulsing/intense)
###186 Tom Rivellini: 'This big huge parachute that we've got-'
###128 'it'll only slow us down to about 200 miles an hour.'
###191 'And that's not slow enough to land.'
###194 'So we have no choice but we've got to cut it off!'
###197 (whoosh) (music cuts)
###198 'And then come down on rockets.'
###200 (engines blast)
###201 'Once we turn those rocket motors on-'
###202 'if we dont do something, we're just going to smack right back into the parachute!'
###205 (engines blast) (music- big pounding drums)
###206 'So the first thing we do is make this really radical 'divert maneuver''
###210 'We fly off to the side.'
###212 Adam Steltzner: 'Diverting away from the parachute, killing our horizontal velocity and our vertical velocity'
###218 'getting the rover moving straight up and down, so it can look at the surface with its radar-'
###224 'and see where we're gonna land.'
###225 'And we head straight down'
###228 'to the bottom of a crater'
###230 'right beside a six kilometer-high mountain!'
###233 (music- grand)
###235 Anita Sengupta: 'We can't get those rocket engines too close to the ground.'
###238 'Because if we were to descent propulsively all the way to the ground-
###242 'we would essentially create this massive dust cloud. That dust cloud could then land on the rover-'
###246 'It could damage mechanisms and it could damage instruments.'
###249 'So the way we solve that problem, is by using the skycrane maneuver.'
###254 Adam Steltzner: '20 meters above the surface, we have to lower the rover below us-'
###260 'on a tether that's 21 feet long.'
###263 'And then deposit it, on its wheels, on the surface.'
###267 (music- intense and climactic)
###268 Miguel San Martin: 'As the rover touches down and is now on the ground,'
###271 'the descent stage- it's on a collision course with the rover!'
###274 'We must cut the bridal immediately and fly the descent stage to a safe distance from the rover.'
###279 (music crescendos and ends) (thunderous rockets echo)
###284 (music-final orchestra hit over dark drone) (wind in background)
###290 (music- dark drone continues with faint ticking sound)
