KRISHNA ANDAVOLU (OFFSCREEN):
We're here to find out about


3
0:0:4,37 --> 0:0:7,5
something that frankly most
Jamaicans are uncomfortable


4
0:0:7,5 --> 0:0:8,16
talking about.


5
0:0:8,16 --> 0:0:10,63
It's called Obeah, and it's an
Afro-Caribbean religion that


6
0:0:10,63 --> 0:0:12,81
has its roots in magic
and sorcery.


7
0:0:12,81 --> 0:0:15,88
There's good aspects of it, and
then there's kind of evil


8
0:0:15,88 --> 0:0:16,67
aspects of it.


9
0:0:16,67 --> 0:0:19,32
The first place we're going to
go is an occult shop, an Obeah


10
0:0:19,32 --> 0:0:22,56
shop, so it has sort of like the
materials and the things


11
0:0:22,56 --> 0:0:26,57
that you need for an Obeah man
to do rituals and stuff.


12
0:0:26,57 --> 0:0:26,546
-Sounds exciting.


13
0:0:26,546 --> 0:0:27,35
-Yeah.


14
0:0:27,35 --> 0:0:29,48
Well, honestly, I'm
a little scared.


15
0:0:29,48 --> 0:0:30,8
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU (OFFSCREEN):
Can you tell us where we can


16
0:0:30,8 --> 0:0:32,2
find like a real Obeah man?


17
0:0:32,2 --> 0:0:36,58
-Could go down by Wollaston
to meet Joseph.


18
0:0:36,58 --> 0:0:38,296
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU (OFFSCREEN):
Have you ever seen a demon?


19
0:0:38,296 --> 0:0:40,59
-Of course, I've seen
many demons.

0:0:40,59 --> 0:2:40,59
