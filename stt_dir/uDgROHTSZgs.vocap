###1 An ocean liner is a totally enclosed system.
###5 It has medical, hospitals, emergency rooms.
###9 but it has no kitchens in the bedrooms. There's a dining area.
###13 It's inefficient to put a kitchen in every bedroom
###18 on the ocean liner. Do you understand that?
###21 They have areas set aside for that.
###23 They have a nurse, several nurses, on the ocean liner
###28 but what does a nurse do? A nurse can bandage.
###32 She can close in surgery.
###34 There's no reason why
###37 the future will not have automated systems for doing that.
###41 They can invite a doctor from any area of the globe
###46 on board that boat. They can invite him
###49 as a virtual image or as a symbol manipulator
###53 and that doctor can study the condition without being there.
###58 You have a totally different system. That's why I use the term
###63 'total enclosure systems'.
###66 Each building generates its own electricity.
###69 It provides for all human needs
###71 and even grows or prepares food in the building.
###76 Today you have places where you have fast food.
###79 You have 15 cooks and waitresses and all that.
###83 In the future, you'll be able to extrude the food
###87 very rapidly with no people at all. You don't need people.
###91 You don't need waitresses, cooks, and all.
###93 What you need is the food handled
###96 the way the food is handled by people, only much faster.
###100 Remember, it takes a doctor time to diagnose.
###103 He's got to study the symbols and tell what the problem might be.
###108 Scanning by machine is very fast.
###112 I can't tell you exactly what hospitals will look like
###117 or what the cities will look like.
###119 Although we know that beds would be very similar
###123 only they'd be more flexible.
###127 Not only that, the bed will have monitors built-in.
###130 If there's any kind of emergency, the bed can stimulate you
###136 out of that emergency and call for help without you even knowing it.
###141 If you have palpitations or unusual physical conditions
###145 while you're asleep, a staff would arrive.
###149 When I say 'total enclosure' I mean
###153 methods for dealing with all problems that humans might have.
###159 Does that mean there won't be a kitchen in every home?
###162 There will be, during the transition.
###165 Until we realize, instead of having 5,000 homes
###169 with 5,000 sinks and 5,000 ovens
###173 and refrigerators, you have gigantic refrigerators
###177 and a food preparation system. Do you understand that?
###182 It will not be like it is today.
###184 When people look at these cities that I drew up here
###187 they picture conventional approaches:
###190 a bedroom, a kitchen, a dining room, a dining area
###195 because you have people over for lunch
###198 the same value systems we have today.
###201 I would say that this is where the future is going
###205 and the future design would depend on how far into the future
###210 and how far technology has gone.
###213 When they can read symbols and make diagnosis
###216 when a machine can do drafting instead of thousands of draftsmen...
###221 A machine can do drafting much faster than man.
###225 It can scan those lines in
###227 if you put in the specifications of what you want.
###231 If you want a hospital to house a thousand people
###237 with the most economical structures
###240 which have built-in heating and cooling systems
###245 all that can be stored in information systems.
###249 The building can probably be forthcoming in minutes
###253 than rather hours that it takes draftsmen to do it
###257 and the amount of draftsmen and the amount of space allotted for things
###261 will not be the same. If you took an industrial area
###266 with movable walls
###268 and if some manufacturing process needed
###271 the production of 100 aerocars a day
###277 that space could be assembled.
###279 The movable walls could move to accommodate the production methods.
###283 If the production methods are faster two years from now
###287 the walls come together, the factory is smaller
###290 and the production rate is higher.
###292 Whatever you have today: ovens, kitchens; all those things
###296 will be smaller in the future, produce things much faster
###300 and not occupy the same space.
###303 When you say "How much space do you need for hospitals?"
###307 It depends: If people eat nutritious food, do exercise
###310 you don't have many hospitals.
###312 I can't tell you exactly what the hospital space will be
###317 or how technical they will be.
###319 I can only say this:
###322 The future will occupy much less space for the same turnout
###327 and that's the message. If you try to design a city
###333 with a hundred drafting tables in it, or 30 machines
###339 that is with today's thinking.
###341 And the building will get... The zone that creates that
###345 will be smaller and have less people.
###348 Instead of having generalists
###350 where the doctor is a generalist and he knows
###353 everything from neurology to other physical problems
###357 it's much easier to have computers with that information.
###360 Not only do they scan you and record it in symbolic logic
###365 what the condition is, it is then read.
###368 Instead of doctors, it's read by a machine, very rapidly
###373 and then the appropriate action can be taken by a machine
###377 if it's surgery or whatever else is required.
###381 To sit down and design a surgical system
###384 based on today's values and today's methodology
###388 would be inappropriate for the future.
###391 A city of that size will do ten times the work
###395 that a city today of the same size does.
###399 That's why I can't give you an exact description
###402 of what hospitals will be like, only an overview, in general.
###407 A ship is a total enclosure system.
###411 A passenger liner that has a thousand passengers
###414 has hospital equipment, cooking, dining areas, sleeping areas
###419 air conditioned, children's room, and nurses take care of children.
###423 It has everything that a thousand passengers may need.
###428 Do you understand that? A ship is almost a total enclosure system.
###433 It doesn't generate its own energy.
###436 It uses machines, diesel engines
###439 to generate electricity to operate the generators.
###443 In the future, the surface of the ship
###446 will supply the energy needed. The wave power
###450 and the surrounding area will supply that ship
###453 with the energy it needs rather than require input.
###458 Most of the buildings that I draw that you see there
###461 can be put in the cities of the future on the outer perimeter.
###466 You need not... You can use the same basic drawings that I have today
###471 but trying to fill in the buildings, as to what's in them
###475 I'd rather not divulge that specific information.
###479 I can go into specifics
###482 but they would only serve temporarily.
###486 The method of delivery of people or moving people
###490 depends on the technology of the future
###492 and it depends on how easy it is to move people.
###498 If you have total enclosure systems, it means each system
###502 is self-operating. It doesn't depend on central power
###506 but they're all connected to the central computer
###509 and they're connected to all events in other cities.
###513 If the city system mechanisms fail
###516 other mechanisms take over
###518 and notify the appropriate people
###521 or the appropriate machines to carry out a given task.
###527 They took all kinds of cardiograms of me today
###532 and then it goes to the cardiologist.
###535 The blood test is divided into different systems
###538 where people with microscopes analyze the blood.
###541 Whatever they see, they draw conclusions.
###546 If it's symbolic rather than visual, they draw conclusions.
###552 Machines can draw the same conclusions and many more.
###556 (Roxanne) They've had experiments where they've given the same blood
###559 to many different labs and they drew up different conclusions.
###562 - I know, because their equipment varies in sensitivity, sometimes
###568 and the time period, the temperature and other variables
###572 which are not controlled. Also the profit motive
###577 affects how late their equipment is, how modern.
###582 People are more concerned with how many customers
###585 or how many clients they've had.
###588 The future concern is: optimizing human performance
###594 which is very different, or equipment performance
###598 making it date optimal
###601 and all information's available and no patents
###604 so you can use the latest information in designing your machinery.
###609 You can correspond with people that know more about it than you do
###613 or you can correspond with machines that know more about it than you do.
###618 I can't say. It depends on when it's built.
