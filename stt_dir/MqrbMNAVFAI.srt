4
0:0:11,454 --> 0:0:17,367
[Off voice] Welcome to the PBS NewsHour special coverage of the 2012 vice presidential debate


5
0:0:17,367 --> 0:0:22,372
between Vice President Joe Biden and Congressman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.


6
0:0:22,372 --> 0:0:24,5
[Judy Woodruff] Good evening, I'm Judy Woodruff


7
0:0:24,5 --> 0:0:29,818
[Gwen Ifill] And I'm Gwen Ifill. Tonight will be  the only debate between the vice presidential candidates.


8
0:0:29,818 --> 0:0:34,407
It will be moderated by Martha Raddatz of ABC News, and it starts in less than a minute


9
0:0:34,407 --> 0:0:38,494
from the Norton Center on the campus of Centre College in Danville, Kentucky.


10
0:0:38,494 --> 0:0:42,78
[Judy Woodruff] Mark Shields and David Brooks are here with us and after the debate,


11
0:0:42,78 --> 0:0:48,726
we will talk to NewsHour political editor Christina Bellantoni, to presidential historian Michael Beschloss,


12
0:0:48,726 --> 0:0:55,224
plus Jonathan Martin of Politico and Sam Youngman of Reuters will all join us from the debate site.


13
0:0:55,224 --> 0:1:1,547
[Gwen Ifill] We'll also be streaming the debate online and offering additional content on our live blog.


14
0:1:1,547 --> 0:1:10,921
[Judy Woodruff] And we're on the edge of our seats and now here's the moderator, Martha Raddatz.


15
0:1:10,921 --> 0:1:12,917
(Live - Norton Center, Centre College)


16
0:1:12,917 --> 0:1:13,848
﻿[Martha Raddatz] Good evening,


17
0:1:13,848 --> 0:1:18,839
and welcome to the  first and only vice presidential debate of 2012,


18
0:1:18,839 --> 0:1:22,24
sponsored by the  Commission on Presidential Debates.


19
0:1:22,24 --> 0:1:26,691
I'm Martha Raddatz of ABC News, and I  am honored to moderate this debate


20
0:1:26,691 --> 0:1:31,439
between 2 men who have dedicated  much of their lives to public service.


21
0:1:31,439 --> 0:1:36,44
Tonight's debate is divided between domestic and foreign policy issues.


22
0:1:36,44 --> 0:1:39,316
And  I'm going to move back and forth between foreign and domestic


23
0:1:39,316 --> 0:1:42,809
since  that is what a vice president or president would have to do.


24
0:1:42,809 --> 0:1:45,275
We will have 9 different segments.


25
0:1:45,275 --> 0:1:49,409
At the beginning of each segment, I will ask both candidates a question,


26
0:1:49,409 --> 0:1:51,84
and they will each have 2 minutes to answer.


27
0:1:51,84 --> 0:1:56,321
Then I will encourage a discussion between the candidates with follow-up questions.


28
0:1:56,321 --> 0:2:0,414
By coin toss, it has been determined that Vice President Biden


29
0:2:0,414 --> 0:2:3,64
will be first to answer the opening question.


30
0:2:3,64 --> 0:2:6,8
We have a wonderful audience here at Centre College tonight.


31
0:2:6,8 --> 0:2:11,168
You will no doubt hear their enthusiasm at the end of the debate and right now


32
0:2:11,168 --> 0:2:29,227
as we welcome Vice President Joe Biden and Congressman Paul Ryan. 
(Applause.)


33
0:2:29,227 --> 0:2:31,335
Very nice to see you. Very nice to see you.


34
0:2:31,335 --> 0:2:41,341
[Joe Biden]: How are you doing?


35
0:2:41,341 --> 0:2:44,22
[Raddatz] OK, you got your little wave to the families in. That's great.


36
0:2:44,22 --> 0:2:48,7
Good evening, gentlemen. It really is an honor to be here with both of you.


37
0:2:48,7 --> 0:2:52,604
I would like to begin with Libya on a rather somber note.


38
0:2:52,604 --> 0:2:56,589
One month ago tonight, on the anniversary of 9/11,


39
0:2:56,589 --> 0:3:0,773
Ambassador Chris Stevens and 3 other brave Americans were killed


40
0:3:0,773 --> 0:3:3,122
in a terrorist attack in Benghazi.


41
0:3:3,122 --> 0:3:7,973
The State Department has now made clear there were no protesters there.


42
0:3:7,973 --> 0:3:11,891
It was a pre-planned assault by heavily armed men.


43
0:3:11,891 --> 0:3:16,706
Wasn't this a massive intelligence failure, Vice President Biden?


44
0:3:16,706 --> 0:3:18,486
[Joe Biden] What it was, it was a tragedy, Martha.


45
0:3:18,486 --> 0:3:23,634
It — Chris Stevens was one of our best. We lost 3 of our other brave Americans.


46
0:3:23,634 --> 0:3:27,886
And I can make absolutely 2 commitments to you and all of the American people tonight:


47
0:3:27,886 --> 0:3:33,802
One, we will find and bring to justice the men who did this.


48
0:3:33,802 --> 0:3:35,853
And secondly, we will get to the bottom of it,


49
0:3:35,853 --> 0:3:38,362
and whatever — wherever the facts lead us,


50
0:3:38,362 --> 0:3:41,829
wherever they lead us, we will make clear to the American public,


51
0:3:41,829 --> 0:3:44,613
because whatever mistakes were made will not be made again.


52
0:3:44,613 --> 0:3:46,659
When you're looking at a president, Martha,


53
0:3:46,659 --> 0:3:50,756
it seems to me that you should take a look at his most important responsibility.


54
0:3:50,756 --> 0:3:54,93
That's carrying forward the national security of the country.


55
0:3:54,93 --> 0:3:57,872
And the best way to do that is take a look at how he's handled he issues of the day.


56
0:3:57,872 --> 0:4:1,69
On Iraq, the president said he would end the war.


57
0:4:1,69 --> 0:4:3,955
Governor Romney said that was a tragic mistake;


58
0:4:3,955 --> 0:4:6,19
we should have left 30 — that he ended it —


59
0:4:6,19 --> 0:4:10,738
Governor Romney said that was a tragic mistake; we should have left 30,000 troops there.


60
0:4:10,738 --> 0:4:14,805
With regard to Afghanistan, he said he will end the war in 2014.


61
0:4:14,805 --> 0:4:17,902
Governor Romney said we should not set a date, number 1,


62
0:4:17,902 --> 0:4:21,59
and number 2, with regard to 2014, it depends.


63
0:4:21,59 --> 0:4:24,738
When it came to Osama bin Laden, the president,


64
0:4:24,738 --> 0:4:28,405
the first day in office — I was sitting with him in the Oval Office.


65
0:4:28,405 --> 0:4:30,815
He called in the CIA and signed an order saying,


66
0:4:30,815 --> 0:4:32,93
my highest priority is to get bin Laden.


67
0:4:32,93 --> 0:4:37,256
Prior to the election, prior to the — him being sworn in,


68
0:4:37,256 --> 0:4:39,876
Governor Romney was asked a question about how he would proceed.


69
0:4:39,876 --> 0:4:42,543
He said, I wouldn't move heaven and earth to get bin Laden.


70
0:4:42,543 --> 0:4:47,66
He didn't understand it was more than about taking a — a murderer off the battlefield;


71
0:4:47,66 --> 0:4:51,543
it was about restoring America's heart and letting terrorists around the world know


72
0:4:51,543 --> 0:4:56,912
if you do harm to America, we will track you to the gates of hell, if need be.


73
0:4:56,912 --> 0:5:0,497
And lastly, the — the president of the United States has —


74
0:5:0,497 --> 0:5:4,568
has led with a steady hand and clear vision.


75
0:5:4,568 --> 0:5:11,122
Governor Romney, the opposite. The last thing we need now is another war.


76
0:5:11,122 --> 0:5:12,681
[Raddatz] Congressman Ryan.


77
0:5:12,681 --> 0:5:17,794
[Paul Ryan]: [Sighs.] We mourn the loss of these 4 Americans who were murdered.


78
0:5:17,794 --> 0:5:20,858
When you take a look at what has happened just in the last few weeks,


79
0:5:20,858 --> 0:5:23,442
they sent the U.N. ambassador out to say


80
0:5:23,442 --> 0:5:26,727
that this was because of a protest and a YouTube video.


81
0:5:26,727 --> 0:5:32,333
It took the president 2 weeks to acknowledge that this was a terrorist attack.


82
0:5:32,333 --> 0:5:35,127
He went to the U.N., and in his speech at the U.N.


83
0:5:35,127 --> 0:5:37,763
he said 5 times — he talked about the YouTube video.


84
0:5:37,763 --> 0:5:44,25
Look, if we are hit by terrorists, we're going to call it for what it is, a terrorist attack.


85
0:5:44,25 --> 0:5:48,717
Our ambassador in Paris has a Marine detachment guarding him.


86
0:5:48,717 --> 0:5:53,245
Shouldn't we have a Marine detachment guarding our ambassador in Benghazi,


87
0:5:53,245 --> 0:5:58,533
a place where we knew that there was an al-Qaida cell with arms?


88
0:5:58,533 --> 0:6:2,399
This is becoming more troubling by the day.


89
0:6:2,399 --> 0:6:3,837
They first blamed the YouTube video;


90
0:6:3,837 --> 0:6:8,164
now they're trying to blame the Romney-Ryan ticket for making this an issue.


91
0:6:8,164 --> 0:6:13,4
And with respect to Iraq, we had the same position before the withdrawal,


92
0:6:13,4 --> 0:6:16,58
which was we agreed with the Obama administration:


93
0:6:16,58 --> 0:6:20,462
Let's have a Status of Forces Agreement to make sure that we secure our gains.


94
0:6:20,462 --> 0:6:24,646
The vice president was put in charge of those negotiations by President Obama,


95
0:6:24,646 --> 0:6:26,7
and they failed to get the agreement.


96
0:6:26,7 --> 0:6:30,58
We don't have a Status of Forces Agreement because they failed to get one.


97
0:6:30,58 --> 0:6:32,5
That's what we are talking about.


98
0:6:32,5 --> 0:6:34,73
And when it comes to our veterans,


99
0:6:34,73 --> 0:6:37,708
we owe them a great debt of gratitude for what they've done for us,


100
0:6:37,708 --> 0:6:40,346
including your son Beau.


101
0:6:40,346 --> 0:6:44,866
But we also want to make sure that we don't lose the things we fought so hard to get.


102
0:6:44,866 --> 0:6:47,225
And with respect to Afghanistan and the 2014 deadline,


103
0:6:47,225 --> 0:6:49,879
we agree with a 2014 transition.


104
0:6:49,879 --> 0:6:53,326
But what we also want to do is make sure that we're not projecting weakness abroad,


105
0:6:53,326 --> 0:6:54,811
and that's what's happening here.


106
0:6:54,811 --> 0:6:59,69
This Benghazi issue would be a tragedy in and of itself.


107
0:6:59,69 --> 0:7:2,721
But unfortunately it's indicative of a broader problem,


108
0:7:2,721 --> 0:7:5,234
and that is what we are watching on our TV screens


109
0:7:5,234 --> 0:7:7,988
is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy,


110
0:7:7,988 --> 0:7:12,105
which is making the world more — more chaotic and us less safe.


111
0:7:12,105 --> 0:7:15,721
[Raddatz]: I just want to talk to you about right in the middle of the crisis.


112
0:7:15,721 --> 0:7:19,69
Governor Romney — and you're talking about this again tonight —


113
0:7:19,69 --> 0:7:24,819
talked about the weakness, talked about apologies from the Obama administration.


114
0:7:24,819 --> 0:7:28,746
Was that really appropriate right in the middle of the crisis?


115
0:7:28,746 --> 0:7:32,352
[Ryan] On that same day, the Obama administration had the exact same position.


116
0:7:32,352 --> 0:7:35,89
Let's recall that they disavowed their own statement


117
0:7:35,89 --> 0:7:38,52
that they had put out earlier in the day in Cairo.


118
0:7:38,52 --> 0:7:39,929
So we had the same position, but we will —


119
0:7:39,929 --> 0:7:43,131
it's never to early to speak out for our values.


120
0:7:43,131 --> 0:7:47,64
We should have spoken out right away when the Green Revolution was up and starting,


121
0:7:47,64 --> 0:7:50,213
when the mullahs in Iran were attacking their people.


122
0:7:50,213 --> 0:7:52,952
We should not have called Bashar Assad a reformer


123
0:7:52,952 --> 0:7:56,264
when he was turning his Russian-provided guns on his own people.


124
0:7:56,264 --> 0:8:2,64
We should always stand up for peace, for democracy, for individual rights,


125
0:8:2,64 --> 0:8:5,331
and we should not be imposing these devastating defense cuts,


126
0:8:5,331 --> 0:8:9,377
because what that does when we equivocate on our values,


127
0:8:9,377 --> 0:8:11,524
when we show that we're cutting our own defense —
[Biden] Am I going to get to say anything here?


128
0:8:11,524 --> 0:8:12,855
[Ryan] — it makes us more weak.


129
0:8:12,855 --> 0:8:14,955
It projects weakness, and when we look weak,


130
0:8:14,955 --> 0:8:16,994
our adversaries are much more willing to test us,


131
0:8:16,994 --> 0:8:19,298
they're more brazen in their attacks, and our allies are less willing to —


132
0:8:19,298 --> 0:8:22,344
[Biden] With all due respect, that's a bunch of malarkey. In fact —


133
0:8:22,344 --> 0:8:23,767
[Raddatz] And why is that so?


134
0:8:23,767 --> 0:8:26,343
[Biden] Because not a single thing he said is accurate. First of all —


135
0:8:26,343 --> 0:8:27,382
[Raddatz] Be specific.


136
0:8:27,382 --> 0:8:28,651
[Biden] I will be very specific.


137
0:8:28,651 --> 0:8:32,743
Number one, the — this lecture on embassy security —


138
0:8:32,743 --> 0:8:36,82
the congressman here cut embassy security in his budget


139
0:8:36,82 --> 0:8:41,692
by $300 million below what we asked for, number 1.


140
0:8:41,692 --> 0:8:43,564
So much for the embassy security piece.


141
0:8:43,564 --> 0:8:47,123
Number 2, Governor Romney, before he knew the facts,


142
0:8:47,123 --> 0:8:49,905
before he even knew that our ambassador was killed,


143
0:8:49,905 --> 0:8:55,403
he was out making a political statement which was panned by the media around the world.


144
0:8:55,403 --> 0:8:59,68
And this talk about this — this weakness, I —


145
0:8:59,68 --> 0:9:2,136
I don't understand what my friend's talking about here.


146
0:9:2,136 --> 0:9:7,308
We — this is a president who's gone out and done everything he has said he was going to do.


147
0:9:7,308 --> 0:9:11,438
This is the guy who's repaired our alliances so the rest of the world follows us again.


148
0:9:11,438 --> 0:9:15,438
This is the guy who brought the entire world, including Russia and China,


149
0:9:15,438 --> 0:9:20,905
to bring about the most devastating, most devastating


150
0:9:20,905 --> 0:9:27,536
— the most devastating efforts on Iran to make sure that they in fact stop with their —


151
0:9:27,536 --> 0:9:31,455
look, I — I — I just — I mean, these guys bet against America all the time.


152
0:9:31,455 --> 0:9:32,989
[Raddatz] Can we talk about —
[Biden] Yeah, sure.


153
0:9:32,989 --> 0:9:34,843
[Raddatz]  let me go back to Libya.


154
0:9:34,843 --> 0:9:38,143
[Biden] What were you first told about the attack?


155
0:9:38,143 --> 0:9:41,568
Why were people talking about protests?


156
0:9:41,568 --> 0:9:47,637
When people in the consulate first saw armed men attacking with guns,


157
0:9:47,637 --> 0:9:49,822
there were no protesters.
[Biden] Because...


158
0:9:49,822 --> 0:9:52,273
[Raddatz] Why did that go on for weeks?
[Biden] Because that's exactly what we were told —


159
0:9:52,273 --> 0:9:56,236
[Raddatz] By who?
[Biden] — by the intelligence community. The intelligence community told us that.


160
0:9:56,236 --> 0:10:1,351
As they learned more facts about exactly what happened, they changed their assessment.


161
0:10:1,351 --> 0:10:4,587
That's why there's also an investigation headed by Tom Pickering,


162
0:10:4,587 --> 0:10:7,787
a leading diplomat in the — from the Reagan years,


163
0:10:7,787 --> 0:10:10,653
who is doing an investigation as to whether or not there were any lapses,


164
0:10:10,653 --> 0:10:13,541
what the lapses were, so that they will never happen again. But —


165
0:10:13,541 --> 0:10:15,312
[Raddatz]  And they wanted more security there.


166
0:10:15,312 --> 0:10:18,291
[Biden] Well, we weren't told they wanted more security again.


167
0:10:18,291 --> 0:10:20,521
We did not know they wanted more security again.


168
0:10:20,521 --> 0:10:24,328
And by the way, at the time we were told exactly —


169
0:10:24,328 --> 0:10:28,876
we said exactly what the intelligence community told us that they knew.


170
0:10:28,876 --> 0:10:30,53
That was the assessment.


171
0:10:30,53 --> 0:10:32,733
And as the intelligence community changed their view,


172
0:10:32,733 --> 0:10:34,912
we made it clear they changed their view.


173
0:10:34,912 --> 0:10:37,589
That's why I said, we will get to the bottom of this.


174
0:10:37,589 --> 0:10:39,979
You know, usually when there's a crisis, we pull together.


175
0:10:39,979 --> 0:10:42,2
We pull together as a nation.


176
0:10:42,2 --> 0:10:45,226
But as I said, even before we knew what happened to the ambassador,


177
0:10:45,226 --> 0:10:48,876
the Governor was holding a press conference — was holding a press conference.


178
0:10:48,876 --> 0:10:50,868
That's not presidential leadership.


179
0:10:50,868 --> 0:10:53,61
[Raddatz] Mr. Ryan, I want to ask you about —


180
0:10:53,61 --> 0:10:56,62
the Romney campaign talks a lot about no apologies.


181
0:10:56,62 --> 0:10:58,797
He has a book called No Apologies.


182
0:10:58,797 --> 0:11:3,94
Should the U.S. have apologized for Americans burning Qurans in Afghanistan?


183
0:11:3,94 --> 0:11:9,195
Should the U.S. apologize for U.S. Marines urinating on Taliban corpses?


184
0:11:9,195 --> 0:11:14,343
[Ryan] Oh, gosh, yes. Urinating on Taliban corpses? What we should not apologize for —


185
0:11:14,343 --> 0:11:15,751
[Raddatz] Burning Qurans immediately.


186
0:11:15,751 --> 0:11:19,55
[Ryan] What — what we should not be apologizing for are standing up for our values.


187
0:11:19,55 --> 0:11:22,471
What we should not be doing is saying to the Egyptian people,


188
0:11:22,471 --> 0:11:25,706
while Mubarak is cracking down on them,


189
0:11:25,706 --> 0:11:28,327
that he's a good guy and then the next week say he ought to go.


190
0:11:28,327 --> 0:11:31,758
What we should not be doing is rejecting claims for


191
0:11:31,758 --> 0:11:35,527
— calls for more security in our barracks, in our Marine —


192
0:11:35,527 --> 0:11:38,25
we need Marines in Benghazi


193
0:11:38,25 --> 0:11:41,573
when the commander on the ground says we need more forces for security.


194
0:11:41,573 --> 0:11:44,675
There were requests for extra security. Those requests were not honored.


195
0:11:44,675 --> 0:11:48,321
Look, this was the anniversary of 9/11.


196
0:11:48,321 --> 0:11:53,188
It was Libya, a country we knew we had al-Qaida cells there.


197
0:11:53,188 --> 0:11:56,783
As we know, al-Qaida and its affiliates are on the rise in Northern Africa.


198
0:11:56,783 --> 0:12:2,75
And we did not give our ambassador in Benghazi a Marine detachment?


199
0:12:2,75 --> 0:12:5,921
Of course there is an investigation so we can make sure that this never happens again.


200
0:12:5,921 --> 0:12:10,358
But when it comes to speaking up for our values, we should not apologize for those.


201
0:12:10,358 --> 0:12:11,75
Here is the problem.


202
0:12:11,75 --> 0:12:15,609
Look at all the various issues out there and that's unraveling before our eyes.


203
0:12:15,609 --> 0:12:17,911
The vice president talks about sanctions on Iran.


204
0:12:17,911 --> 0:12:19,211
They got — we've had 4 —


205
0:12:19,211 --> 0:12:20,388
[Raddatz]  Let's move to Iran.


206
0:12:20,388 --> 0:12:24,148
I'd actually like to move to Iran because there is really no bigger national security —


207
0:12:24,148 --> 0:12:25,394
[Ryan] Absolutely.


208
0:12:25,394 --> 0:12:26,878
[Raddatz] — this country is facing.


209
0:12:26,878 --> 0:12:29,342
Both President Obama and Governor Romney have said


210
0:12:29,342 --> 0:12:35,362
they will prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, even if that means military action.


211
0:12:35,362 --> 0:12:38,314
Last week former Defense Secretary Bob Gates said


212
0:12:38,314 --> 0:12:41,328
a strike on Iran's facilities would not work and,


213
0:12:41,328 --> 0:12:46,8
quote, could prove catastrophic, haunting us for generations.


214
0:12:46,8 --> 0:12:51,756
Can the 2 of you be absolutely clear and specific to the American people


215
0:12:51,756 --> 0:12:56,151
how effective would a military strike be? Congressman Ryan.


216
0:12:56,151 --> 0:13:0,404
[Ryan] We cannot allow Iran to gain a nuclear weapons capability.


217
0:13:0,404 --> 0:13:4,736
Now, let's take a look at where we've gone — come from.


218
0:13:4,736 --> 0:13:6,144
When Barack Obama was elected,


219
0:13:6,144 --> 0:13:10,271
they had enough fissile material, nuclear material, to make 1 bomb.


220
0:13:10,271 --> 0:13:11,776
Now they have enough for 5.


221
0:13:11,776 --> 0:13:13,199
They're racing toward a nuclear weapon.


222
0:13:13,199 --> 0:13:16,7
They're 4 years closer toward a nuclear weapons capability.


223
0:13:16,7 --> 0:13:18,297
We've had 4 different sanctions at the U.N. on Iran,


224
0:13:18,297 --> 0:13:21,235
3 from the Bush administration, 1 here.


225
0:13:21,235 --> 0:13:23,91
And the only reason we got it is because Russia watered it down


226
0:13:23,91 --> 0:13:27,81
and prevented the — the sanctions from hitting the central bank.


227
0:13:27,81 --> 0:13:30,115
Mitt Romney proposed these sanctions in 2007.


228
0:13:30,115 --> 0:13:33,6
In Congress, I've been fighting for these sanctions since 2009.


229
0:13:33,6 --> 0:13:35,597
The administration was blocking us every step of the way.


230
0:13:35,597 --> 0:13:39,47
Only because we had strong bipartisan support for these tough sanctions


231
0:13:39,47 --> 0:13:43,981
were we able to overrule their objections and put them in spite of the administration.


232
0:13:43,981 --> 0:13:47,225
Imagine what would have happened if we had these sanctions in place earlier.


233
0:13:47,225 --> 0:13:50,517
You think Iran's not brazen? Look at what they're doing.


234
0:13:50,517 --> 0:13:52,971
They're stepping up their terrorist attacks.


235
0:13:52,971 --> 0:13:55,108
They tried a terrorist attack in the United States last year


236
0:13:55,108 --> 0:13:59,74
when they tried to blow up the Saudi ambassador at a restaurant in Washington, D.C.


237
0:13:59,74 --> 0:14:1,194
And talk about credibility.


238
0:14:1,194 --> 0:14:4,642
When this administration says that all options are on the table,


239
0:14:4,642 --> 0:14:8,922
they send out senior administration officials that send all these mixed signals.


240
0:14:8,922 --> 0:14:13,17
And so in order solve this peacefully, which is everybody's goal,


241
0:14:13,17 --> 0:14:16,815
you have to have the ayatollahs change their minds.


242
0:14:16,815 --> 0:14:20,469
Look at where they are. They're moving faster toward a nuclear weapon.


243
0:14:20,469 --> 0:14:23,508
It's because this administration has no credibility on this issue.


244
0:14:23,508 --> 0:14:27,861
It's because this administration watered down sanctions, delayed sanctions,


245
0:14:27,861 --> 0:14:29,38
tried to stop us from putting the tough sanctions in place.


246
0:14:29,38 --> 0:14:31,173
Now we have them in place because of Congress.


247
0:14:31,173 --> 0:14:35,356
They say the military option's on the table but it's not being viewed as credible,


248
0:14:35,356 --> 0:14:40,483
and the key is to do this peacefully, is to make sure that we have credibility.


249
0:14:40,483 --> 0:14:44,64
Under a Romney administration, we will have credibility on this issue.


250
0:14:44,64 --> 0:14:45,795
[Raddatz]  Vice President Biden.


251
0:14:45,795 --> 0:14:46,941
[Biden] It's incredible. (Chuckles.)


252
0:14:46,941 --> 0:14:52,862
Look, imagine had we let the Republican Congress work out the sanctions.


253
0:14:52,862 --> 0:14:57,576
You think there's any possibility the entire world would have joined us,


254
0:14:57,576 --> 0:15:0,841
Russia and China, all of our allies?


255
0:15:0,841 --> 0:15:6,393
These are the most crippling sanctions in the history of sanctions, period, period.


256
0:15:6,393 --> 0:15:10,607
When Governor Romney's asked about it, he said, we got to keep these sanctions.


257
0:15:10,607 --> 0:15:12,599
When you say, well, you're talking about doing more,


258
0:15:12,599 --> 0:15:14,276
what are you — are you — you're going to go to war? Is that you want to do now?


259
0:15:14,276 --> 0:15:15,983
[Ryan]  We want to prevent war!


260
0:15:15,983 --> 0:15:18,89
[Biden]  We have — and I — the interesting thing is, how they're going to prevent war.


261
0:15:18,89 --> 0:15:22,29
How are they going to prevent war if they say that there's nothing more that we


262
0:15:22,29 --> 0:15:26,55
— that they say we should do than what we've already done, number 1?


263
0:15:26,55 --> 0:15:31,539
And number 2, with regard to the ability of the United States to take action militarily,


264
0:15:31,539 --> 0:15:36,123
it is — it is not in my purview to talk about classified information.


265
0:15:36,123 --> 0:15:41,827
But we feel quite confident we could deal a serious blow to the Iranians.


266
0:15:41,827 --> 0:15:46,131
But number 2, the Iranians are — the Israelis and the United States —


267
0:15:46,131 --> 0:15:50,697
our military and intelligence communities are absolutely the same exact place


268
0:15:50,697 --> 0:15:57,14
in terms of how close — how close the Iranians are to getting a nuclear weapon.


269
0:15:57,14 --> 0:15:59,261
They are a good way away.


270
0:15:59,261 --> 0:16:2,946
There is no difference between our view and theirs.


271
0:16:2,946 --> 0:16:5,323
When my friend talks about fissile material,


272
0:16:5,323 --> 0:16:10,62
they have to take this highly enriched uranium, get it from 20% up.


273
0:16:10,62 --> 0:16:13,548
Then they have to be able to have something to put it in.


274
0:16:13,548 --> 0:16:17,573
There is no weapon that the Iranians have at this point.


275
0:16:17,573 --> 0:16:22,843
Both the Israelis and we know we'll know if they start the process of building a weapon.


276
0:16:22,843 --> 0:16:29,34
So all this bluster I keep hearing, all this loose talk — what are they talking about?


277
0:16:29,34 --> 0:16:31,75
Are you talking about to be more credible?


278
0:16:31,75 --> 0:16:33,25
But what — what more can the president do?


279
0:16:33,25 --> 0:16:35,85
Stand before the United Nations, tell the whole world,


280
0:16:35,85 --> 0:16:37,963
directly communicate to the ayatollah:


281
0:16:37,963 --> 0:16:43,112
We will not let them acquire a nuclear weapon, period,


282
0:16:43,112 --> 0:16:44,967
unless he's talking about going to war.


283
0:16:44,967 --> 0:16:46,535
[Ryan]  Martha, let's just —


284
0:16:46,535 --> 0:16:47,635
[Raddatz] Congressman Ryan.


285
0:16:47,635 --> 0:16:51,773
[Ryan]  — let's look at this from the view of the ayatollahs. What do they see?


286
0:16:51,773 --> 0:16:56,792
They see this administration trying to water down sanctions in Congress for over 2 years.


287
0:16:56,792 --> 0:16:59,613
They're moving faster toward a nuclear weapon;


288
0:16:59,613 --> 0:17:1,76
they're spinning the centrifuges faster.


289
0:17:1,76 --> 0:17:4,733
They see us saying, when we come into the administration,


290
0:17:4,733 --> 0:17:8,314
when they're sworn in, we need more space with our ally Israel.


291
0:17:8,314 --> 0:17:13,371
They see President Obama in New York City the same day Bibi Netanyahu is,


292
0:17:13,371 --> 0:17:16,984
and he's — instead of meeting with him goes on a — on a daily talk show.


293
0:17:16,984 --> 0:17:21,45
They see — when we say that these options are on the table,


294
0:17:21,45 --> 0:17:24,165
the Secretary of defense walked them back.


295
0:17:24,165 --> 0:17:26,906
They are not changing their mind.


296
0:17:26,906 --> 0:17:29,592
That's what we have to do, is change their mind


297
0:17:29,592 --> 0:17:31,587
so they stop pursuing nuclear weapons, and they're going faster.


298
0:17:31,587 --> 0:17:32,81
[Raddatz] How will you do it so quickly?


299
0:17:32,81 --> 0:17:37,938
Look, you both saw Benjamin Netanyahu hold up that picture of a bomb


300
0:17:37,938 --> 0:17:42,621
with the red line and talking about the red line being in spring.


301
0:17:42,621 --> 0:17:48,274
So can you solve this — if the Romney-Ryan ticket is elected,


302
0:17:48,274 --> 0:17:54,29
can you solve this in 2 months before spring and avoid nuclear — nuclear --


303
0:17:54,29 --> 0:17:55,364
[Ryan] We — we can debate a timeline.


304
0:17:55,364 --> 0:17:56,49
[Raddatz] (Inaudible.)


305
0:17:56,49 --> 0:17:56,934
[Ryan] We can debate the timeline,


306
0:17:56,934 --> 0:17:58,541
whether there's — it's that short a time or longer.


307
0:17:58,541 --> 0:18:0,748
I — I agree that it's probably longer.


308
0:18:0,748 --> 0:18:3,456
Number 2, it's all about credibility.


309
0:18:3,456 --> 0:18:4,356
[Raddatz] You don't agree with that bomb and what the Israelis —


310
0:18:4,356 --> 0:18:5,161
[Biden] No, look — (inaudible) —


311
0:18:5,161 --> 0:18:6,261
[Ryan] (Inaudible) — look, we — we both agree —


312
0:18:6,261 --> 0:18:7,484
[Raddatz] Vice President Biden.


313
0:18:7,484 --> 0:18:8,784
[Ryan I don't want to go into classified stuff,


314
0:18:8,784 --> 0:18:12,351
but we both agree that to do this peacefully,


315
0:18:12,351 --> 0:18:14,181
you've got to get them to change their minds.


316
0:18:14,181 --> 0:18:16,98
They're not changing their minds, and look at what this administration does —


317
0:18:16,98 --> 0:18:18,19
[Raddatz] But what do you do — (inaudible) —


318
0:18:18,19 --> 0:18:19,396
[Biden] Let me tell you what the ayatollah sees.


319
0:18:19,396 --> 0:18:19,896
[Ryan] You have to have credibility.


320
0:18:19,896 --> 0:18:21,972
[Biden] The ayatollah sees his economy being crippled.


321
0:18:21,972 --> 0:18:27,898
The ayatollah sees that there are 50% fewer exports of oil.


322
0:18:27,898 --> 0:18:30,941
He sees the currency going into the tank.


323
0:18:30,941 --> 0:18:33,564
He sees the economy going into free fall,


324
0:18:33,564 --> 0:18:36,465
and he sees the world for the first time totally united


325
0:18:36,465 --> 0:18:39,598
in opposition to him getting a nuclear weapon.


326
0:18:39,598 --> 0:18:42,674
Now, with regard to Bibi, he's been my friend for 39 years.


327
0:18:42,674 --> 0:18:45,395
The president has met with Bibi a dozen times.


328
0:18:45,395 --> 0:18:48,666
He's spoken to Bibi Netanyahu as much as he's spoken to anybody.


329
0:18:48,666 --> 0:18:52,688
The idea that we're not — I was in a — just before he went to the U.N.,


330
0:18:52,688 --> 0:18:55,478
I was in a conference call with the — with the president,


331
0:18:55,478 --> 0:18:58,762
with him talking to Bibi, for well over an hour


332
0:18:58,762 --> 0:19:3,496
in — in — in — in — in stark relief and detail about what was going on.


333
0:19:3,496 --> 0:19:5,869
This is a bunch of stuff. Look, here's the deal —


334
0:19:5,869 --> 0:19:7,369
[Raddatz] What does that mean, "a bunch of stuff"?


335
0:19:7,369 --> 0:19:8,823
[Biden] Well, it means it's simply inaccurate.


336
0:19:8,823 --> 0:19:9,708
[Ryan] It's Irish. (Chuckles.)


337
0:19:9,708 --> 0:19:13,61
[Biden] It is. (Laughter.) The Irish call it malarkey.


338
0:19:13,61 --> 0:19:14,91
[Raddatz] Thanks for the translation. OK.


339
0:19:14,91 --> 0:19:15,453
[Biden] No, the Irish call it malarkey. (Laughter.)


340
0:19:15,453 --> 0:19:20,29
But last thing: the secretary of defense has made it absolutely clear.


341
0:19:20,29 --> 0:19:20,837
He didn't walk anything back.


342
0:19:20,837 --> 0:19:26,31
We will not allow the Iranians to get a nuclear weapon.


343
0:19:26,31 --> 0:19:29,469
What Bibi held up there was when they get to the point


344
0:19:29,469 --> 0:19:33,696
where they can enrich uranium enough to put into a weapon,


345
0:19:33,696 --> 0:19:36,684
they don't have a weapon to put it into.


346
0:19:36,684 --> 0:19:39,39
Let's all calm down a little bit here.


347
0:19:39,39 --> 0:19:42,853
Iran is more isolated today than when we took office.


348
0:19:42,853 --> 0:19:47,499
It was on the ascendancy when we took office. It is totally isolated.


349
0:19:47,499 --> 0:19:48,337
[Raddatz] Congressman Ryan —


350
0:19:48,337 --> 0:19:49,56
[Biden] I don't know what world you guys are in.


351
0:19:49,56 --> 0:19:50,6
[Raddatz] Congressman Ryan —


352
0:19:50,6 --> 0:19:51,76
[Ryan] Thank — thank heavens we have these sanctions in place.


353
0:19:51,76 --> 0:19:53,291
It's in spite of their opposition.


354
0:19:53,291 --> 0:19:54,53
[Biden] (Chuckles.) Oh, God.


355
0:19:54,53 --> 0:19:56,76
[Ryan] They have given 20 waivers to this sanction.


356
0:19:56,76 --> 0:19:59,473
And all I have to point to are the results.


357
0:19:59,473 --> 0:20:2,222
They're 4 years closer toward a nuclear weapon.


358
0:20:2,222 --> 0:20:3,87
I think that case speaks for itself.


359
0:20:3,87 --> 0:20:5,385
[Raddatz] Can you tell the American people what's worse than —


360
0:20:5,385 --> 0:20:6,562
[Biden] By the way, they're — no,


361
0:20:6,562 --> 0:20:7,62
no, they are not 4 years closer to a nuclear weapon.


362
0:20:7,62 --> 0:20:8,885
[Raddatz] — another war in the Middle East or —


363
0:20:8,885 --> 0:20:12,936
[Biden] They're — they're closer to being able to get enough fissile material


364
0:20:12,936 --> 0:20:15,793
to put in a weapon if they had a weapon. But —


365
0:20:15,793 --> 0:20:17,293
[Raddatz] You're acting a little bit like they don't want one, though.


366
0:20:17,293 --> 0:20:20,74
[Biden] Oh, I didn't say — no, I'm not saying that's - facts matter, Martha.


367
0:20:20,74 --> 0:20:23,793
You're a foreign policy expert. Facts matter.


368
0:20:23,793 --> 0:20:25,813
All this loose talk about them


369
0:20:25,813 --> 0:20:29,57
— all they have to do is get to — enrich uranium in a certain amount


370
0:20:29,57 --> 0:20:32,833
and they have a weapon — not true. Not true.


371
0:20:32,833 --> 0:20:38,121
They are more — and if we ever have to take action, unlike where we took office,


372
0:20:38,121 --> 0:20:43,416
we will have the world behind us, and that matters. That matters.


373
0:20:43,416 --> 0:20:47,214
[Raddatz] What about Bob Gates' statement? Let me read that again:


374
0:20:47,214 --> 0:20:51,64
"... could prove catastrophic, haunting us for generations."


375
0:20:51,64 --> 0:20:54,27
[Biden] He is right. It could prove catastrophic


376
0:20:54,27 --> 0:20:55,158
if we do — we do it with — (inaudible) —


377
0:20:55,158 --> 0:20:55,966
[Raddatz] Congressman Ryan?


378
0:20:55,966 --> 0:20:58,386
[Ryan] And what it does is it — and it undermines our credibility


379
0:20:58,386 --> 0:21:2,903
by backing up the point when we make it that all options are on the table.


380
0:21:2,903 --> 0:21:3,91
That's the point.


381
0:21:3,91 --> 0:21:6,247
The ayatollahs see these kinds of statements,


382
0:21:6,247 --> 0:21:9,112
and they think, I'm going to get a nuclear weapon.


383
0:21:9,112 --> 0:21:13,795
When — when we see the kind of equivocation that took place


384
0:21:13,795 --> 0:21:17,852
because this administration wanted a precondition policy —


385
0:21:17,852 --> 0:21:21,182
so when the Green Revolution started up, they were silent for 9 days.


386
0:21:21,182 --> 0:21:25,167
When they see us putting des... desperate -  when they see us putting daylight


387
0:21:25,167 --> 0:21:30,156
between ourselves and our allies in Israel, that gives them encouragement.


388
0:21:30,156 --> 0:21:34,191
When they see Russia watering down any further sanctions


389
0:21:34,191 --> 0:21:37,395
— and the only reason we got a U.N. sanction is because Russia watered it down


390
0:21:37,395 --> 0:21:39,834
and prevented these sanctions from being sanctions in the first place.


391
0:21:39,834 --> 0:21:44,676
So when they see this kind of activity, they are encouraged to continue,


392
0:21:44,676 --> 0:21:45,607
and that's the problem.


393
0:21:45,607 --> 0:21:46,353
[Biden] Martha, let me tell you what Russia's — (inaudible) —


394
0:21:46,353 --> 0:21:47,468
[Raddatz] What — let me ask you what's worse:


395
0:21:47,468 --> 0:21:52,13
war in the Middle East, another war in the Middle East, or a nuclear-armed Iran?


396
0:21:52,13 --> 0:21:52,821
[Ryan] I'll tell you what's worse - I'll tell you what's worse.


397
0:21:52,821 --> 0:21:53,321
[Raddatz] Quickly.


398
0:21:53,321 --> 0:21:55,5
[Ryan] A nuclear-armed Iran,


399
0:21:55,5 --> 0:21:57,988
which triggers a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.


400
0:21:57,988 --> 0:22:0,938
This is the world's largest sponsor of — of terrorism.


401
0:22:0,938 --> 0:22:1,792
They've dedicated themselves —


402
0:22:1,792 --> 0:22:2,63
[Biden] That's the only thing my —


403
0:22:2,63 --> 0:22:3,884
[Ryan] — to wiping an entire country off the map.


404
0:22:3,884 --> 0:22:5,43
They call us the Great Satan.


405
0:22:5,43 --> 0:22:7,507
And if they get nuclear weapons,


406
0:22:7,507 --> 0:22:10,313
other people in the neighborhood will pursue their nuclear weapons as well.


407
0:22:10,313 --> 0:22:11,458
[Raddatz] Vice President Biden.


408
0:22:11,458 --> 0:22:12,312
[Ryan] We can't live with that.


409
0:22:12,312 --> 0:22:17,509
[Biden] War should always be the absolute last resort.


410
0:22:17,509 --> 0:22:20,41
That's why these crippling sanctions,


411
0:22:20,41 --> 0:22:22,743
which Bibi Netanyahu says we should continue


412
0:22:22,743 --> 0:22:27,748
— which, if I'm not mistaken, Governor Romney says we — we should continue.


413
0:22:27,748 --> 0:22:31,565
If I — I may be mistaken; he changes his mind so often, I could be wrong.


414
0:22:31,565 --> 0:22:35,35
But the fact of the matter is, he says they're working.


415
0:22:35,35 --> 0:22:39,12
And the fact is that they are being crippled by them.


416
0:22:39,12 --> 0:22:42,559
And we've made it clear, big nations can't bluff.


417
0:22:42,559 --> 0:22:44,847
This president doesn't bluff.


418
0:22:44,847 --> 0:22:46,809
[Raddatz] Gentlemen, I want to bring the conversation


419
0:22:46,809 --> 0:22:50,469
to a different kind of national security issue, the state of our economy.


420
0:22:50,469 --> 0:22:54,5
The number 1 issue here at home is jobs.


421
0:22:54,5 --> 0:22:58,403
The percentage of unemployed just fell below 8%


422
0:22:58,403 --> 0:23:1,487
for the first time in 43 months.


423
0:23:1,487 --> 0:23:6,4
The Obama administration had projected that it would fall below 6% now,


424
0:23:6,4 --> 0:23:10,372
after the addition of close to a trillion dollars in stimulus money.


425
0:23:10,372 --> 0:23:13,291
So will both of you level with the American people?


426
0:23:13,291 --> 0:23:18,267
Can you get unemployment to under 6%, and how long will it take?


427
0:23:18,267 --> 0:23:19,536
[Biden] I don't know how long it will takw


428
0:23:19,536 --> 0:23:20,98
[Raddatz] Vice President Biden.


429
0:23:20,98 --> 0:23:22,0
[Biden] We can and we will get it under 6%.


430
0:23:22,0 --> 0:23:24,526
Let's look at the — let's take a look at the facts.


431
0:23:24,526 --> 0:23:27,687
Let's look at where we were when we came to office.


432
0:23:27,687 --> 0:23:29,757
The economy was in free fall.


433
0:23:29,757 --> 0:23:32,638
We had — the Great Recession hit.


434
0:23:32,638 --> 0:23:43,252
9 million people lost their job, 1.7 — $1.6 trillion in wealth lost in equity in your homes, in retirement accounts from the middle class.


435
0:23:43,252 --> 0:23:45,328
We knew we had to act for the middle class.


436
0:23:45,328 --> 0:23:48,4
We immediately went out and rescued General Motors.


437
0:23:48,4 --> 0:23:51,418
We went ahead and made sure that we cut taxes for the middle class.


438
0:23:51,418 --> 0:23:54,601
And in addition to that, when that — and when that occurred,


439
0:23:54,601 --> 0:23:58,37
what did Romney do? Romney said, no, let Detroit go bankrupt.


440
0:23:58,37 --> 0:24:1,108
We moved in and helped people refinance their homes.


441
0:24:1,108 --> 0:24:4,212
Governor Romney said, no, let foreclosures hit the bottom.


442
0:24:4,212 --> 0:24:6,748
But it shouldn't be surprising for a guy who says


443
0:24:6,748 --> 0:24:8,9
47% of the American people


444
0:24:8,9 --> 0:24:11,733
are unwilling to take responsibility for their own lives.


445
0:24:11,733 --> 0:24:13,933
My friend recently, in a speech in Washington,


446
0:24:13,933 --> 0:24:16,4
said 30% of the American people are takers.


447
0:24:16,4 --> 0:24:21,132
These people are my mom and dad, the people I grew up with, my neighbors.


448
0:24:21,132 --> 0:24:25,452
They pay more effective tax than Governor Romney pays in his federal income tax.


449
0:24:25,452 --> 0:24:28,653
They are elderly people who in fact are living off of Social Security.


450
0:24:28,653 --> 0:24:32,388
They are veterans and people fighting in Afghanistan right now who are,


451
0:24:32,388 --> 0:24:34,211
quote, not paying any taxes.


452
0:24:34,211 --> 0:24:38,2
I've had it up to here with this notion that 47%


453
0:24:38,2 --> 0:24:41,253
— it's about time they take some responsibility here.


454
0:24:41,253 --> 0:24:43,999
And instead of signing pledges to Grover Norquist


455
0:24:43,999 --> 0:24:48,626
not to ask the wealthiest among us to contribute to bring back the middle class,


456
0:24:48,626 --> 0:24:51,536
they should be signing a pledge saying to the middle class,


457
0:24:51,536 --> 0:24:53,159
we're going to level the playing field.


458
0:24:53,159 --> 0:24:55,183
We're going to give you a fair shot again.


459
0:24:55,183 --> 0:24:59,79
We are going to not repeat the mistakes we made in the past


460
0:24:59,79 --> 0:25:3,338
by having a different set of rules for Wall Street and Main Street,


461
0:25:3,338 --> 0:25:7,819
making sure that we continue to hemorrhage these tax cuts for the superwealthy.


462
0:25:7,819 --> 0:25:10,33
They're pushing the continuation of a tax cut


463
0:25:10,33 --> 0:25:17,807
that will give an additional $500 billion in tax cuts to 120,000 families.


464
0:25:17,807 --> 0:25:22,123
And they're holding hostage the middle-class tax cut because they say,


465
0:25:22,123 --> 0:25:25,265
we won't pass — we won't continue the middle-class tax cut


466
0:25:25,265 --> 0:25:28,246
unless you give the tax cut for the superwealthy.


467
0:25:28,246 --> 0:25:31,69
It's about time they take some responsibility.


468
0:25:31,69 --> 0:25:31,954
[Raddatz] Mr. Ryan.


469
0:25:31,954 --> 0:25:34,432
[Ryan] Joe and I are from similar towns.


470
0:25:34,432 --> 0:25:36,24
He's from Scranton, Pennsylvania.


471
0:25:36,24 --> 0:25:37,355
I'm from Janesville, Wisconsin.


472
0:25:37,355 --> 0:25:40,214
You know what the unemployment rate in Scranton is today?


473
0:25:40,214 --> 0:25:41,161
[Biden] I sure do.


474
0:25:41,161 --> 0:25:42,199
[Ryan] It's 10%,


475
0:25:42,199 --> 0:25:42,945
[Biden] Yeah.


476
0:25:42,945 --> 0:25:44,168
[Ryan]: You know what it was the day you guys came in?


477
0:25:44,168 --> 0:25:44,822
[Biden] [Inaudible]


478
0:25:44,822 --> 0:25:45,645
[Ryan] 8.5%


479
0:25:45,645 --> 0:25:46,314
[Biden] Yeah.


480
0:25:46,314 --> 0:25:47,845
[Ryan] That's how it's going all around America.


481
0:25:47,845 --> 0:25:48,591
Look —


482
0:25:48,591 --> 0:25:50,771
[Biden] You don't read the statistics. That's not "how it's going."


483
0:25:50,771 --> 0:25:51,794
It's going down.


484
0:25:51,794 --> 0:25:52,833
[Raddatz] (Inaudible) — 2-minute answer, please.


485
0:25:52,833 --> 0:25:58,746
[Ryan] Look — (chuckles) — did they come in and inherit a tough situation? Absolutely.


486
0:25:58,746 --> 0:25:59,815
[Biden] (Chuckles.)


487
0:25:59,815 --> 0:26:1,346
[Ryan] But we're going in the wrong direction!


488
0:26:1,346 --> 0:26:5,435
Look at where we are. The economy is barely limping along.


489
0:26:5,435 --> 0:26:6,935
It's growing at 1.3%.


490
0:26:6,935 --> 0:26:8,589
That's slower than it grew last year,


491
0:26:8,589 --> 0:26:10,658
and last year was slower than the year before.


492
0:26:10,658 --> 0:26:14,4
Job growth in September was slower than it was in August,


493
0:26:14,4 --> 0:26:16,194
and August was slower than it was in July.


494
0:26:16,194 --> 0:26:18,11
We're heading in the wrong direction.


495
0:26:18,11 --> 0:26:22,359
23 million Americans are struggling for work today.


496
0:26:22,359 --> 0:26:26,184
15% of Americans are living in poverty today.


497
0:26:26,184 --> 0:26:29,53
This is not what a real recovery looks like.


498
0:26:29,53 --> 0:26:31,973
We need real reforms for a real recovery,


499
0:26:31,973 --> 0:26:34,658
and that's exactly what Mitt Romney and I are proposing.


500
0:26:34,658 --> 0:26:36,281
It's 5-Point plan.


501
0:26:36,281 --> 0:26:39,498
Get America energy-independent in North America by the end of the decade.


502
0:26:39,498 --> 0:26:43,609
Help people who are hurting get the skills they need to get the jobs they want.


503
0:26:43,609 --> 0:26:46,51
Get this deficit and debt under control to prevent a debt crisis.


504
0:26:46,51 --> 0:26:49,566
Make trade work for America so we can make more things in America


505
0:26:49,566 --> 0:26:52,548
and sell them overseas and champion small businesses.


506
0:26:52,548 --> 0:26:55,596
Don't raise taxes on small businesses, because they're our job creators.


507
0:26:55,596 --> 0:26:59,303
He talks about Detroit. Mitt Romney's a car guy.


508
0:26:59,303 --> 0:27:3,353
They keep misquoting him, but let me tell you about the Mitt Romney I know.


509
0:27:3,353 --> 0:27:5,651
This is a guy who


510
0:27:5,651 --> 0:27:9,226
— I was talking to a family in Northborough, Massachusetts the other day,


511
0:27:9,226 --> 0:27:11,695
Cheryl and Mark Nixon (sp).


512
0:27:11,695 --> 0:27:14,942
Their kids were hit in a car crash, 4 of them


513
0:27:14,942 --> 0:27:17,382
— 2 of them, Rob (sp) and Reid (sp), were paralyzed.


514
0:27:17,382 --> 0:27:19,536
The Romneys didn't know them. They went to the same church.


515
0:27:19,536 --> 0:27:20,636
They never met before.


516
0:27:20,636 --> 0:27:23,14
Mitt asked if he could come over on Christmas.


517
0:27:23,14 --> 0:27:27,395
He brought his boys, his wife and gifts.


518
0:27:27,395 --> 0:27:30,631
Later on he said, I know you're struggling, Mark (sp).


519
0:27:30,631 --> 0:27:32,716
Don't worry about their college; I'll pay for it.


520
0:27:32,716 --> 0:27:34,277
When Mark (sp) told me this story


521
0:27:34,277 --> 0:27:36,347
— because you know what, Mitt Romney doesn't tell these stories.


522
0:27:36,347 --> 0:27:37,554
The Nixons told this story.


523
0:27:37,554 --> 0:27:41,721
When he told me this story, he said it wasn't the help — the cash help;


524
0:27:41,721 --> 0:27:44,509
it's that he gave his time, and he has consistently.


525
0:27:44,509 --> 0:27:48,121
This is a man who gave 30% of his income to charity,


526
0:27:48,121 --> 0:27:49,667
more than the 2 of us combined.


527
0:27:49,667 --> 0:27:51,459
Mitt Romney's a good man.


528
0:27:51,459 --> 0:27:55,24
He cares about 100% of Americans in this country.


529
0:27:55,24 --> 0:27:56,786
And with respect to that quote,


530
0:27:56,786 --> 0:27:59,311
I think the vice president very well knows


531
0:27:59,311 --> 0:28:5,786
that sometimes the words don't come out of your mouth the right way. (Laughter.)


532
0:28:5,786 --> 0:28:7,471
[Biden] But I always say what I mean.


533
0:28:7,471 --> 0:28:9,281
[Raddatz] You —


534
0:28:9,281 --> 0:28:10,258
[Biden] And so does Romney.


535
0:28:10,258 --> 0:28:11,589
[Ryan] We want everybody to succeed.


536
0:28:11,589 --> 0:28:14,751
We want to get people out of poverty, in the middle class,


537
0:28:14,751 --> 0:28:15,866
on to lives of self-sufficiency.


538
0:28:15,866 --> 0:28:18,54
We believe in opportunity and upward mobility.


539
0:28:18,54 --> 0:28:20,62
That's what we're going to push for in a Romney administration.


540
0:28:20,62 --> 0:28:21,285
[Raddatz] Vice President?


541
0:28:21,285 --> 0:28:21,816
[Biden] Look —


542
0:28:21,816 --> 0:28:23,271
[Raddatz] I have a feeling you have a few things to say here. (Laughter.)


543
0:28:23,271 --> 0:28:26,72
[Biden] (Chuckles.) The idea, if you heard that


544
0:28:26,72 --> 0:28:31,555
— that little soliloquy on 47%, and you think he just made a mistake,


545
0:28:31,555 --> 0:28:36,29
then I think you're — I — I — I — I — I got a bridge to sell you.


546
0:28:36,29 --> 0:28:42,637
Look, I don't doubt his personal generosity, and I understand what it's like.


547
0:28:42,637 --> 0:28:45,768
When I was a little younger than the congressman,


548
0:28:45,768 --> 0:28:51,685
my wife was in an accident, killed my daughter and my wife,


549
0:28:51,685 --> 0:28:53,154
and my 2 sons survived.


550
0:28:53,154 --> 0:28:57,284
I have sat in the homes of many people who've gone through what I get through


551
0:28:57,284 --> 0:28:59,307
because the one thing you can give people solace


552
0:28:59,307 --> 0:29:4,276
is to know they know you've been through it, that they can make it.


553
0:29:4,276 --> 0:29:8,663
So I don't doubt his personal commitment to individuals.


554
0:29:8,663 --> 0:29:13,485
But you know what? I know he had no commitment to the automobile industry.


555
0:29:13,485 --> 0:29:18,13
He just let — he said, let it go bankrupt, period, let it drop out.


556
0:29:18,13 --> 0:29:20,414
All this talk — we saved a million jobs.


557
0:29:20,414 --> 0:29:23,49
200 thousand people are working today.


558
0:29:23,49 --> 0:29:26,996
And I have never met 2 guys who are more down on America across the board.


559
0:29:26,996 --> 0:29:28,696
We're told everything is going bad.


560
0:29:28,696 --> 0:29:32,842
We have 5.2 million new jobs, private sector jobs.


561
0:29:32,842 --> 0:29:36,305
We need more, but 5.2 million — if they'd get out of the way,


562
0:29:36,305 --> 0:29:40,27
if they get out of the way and let us pass the tax cut for the middle class,


563
0:29:40,27 --> 0:29:41,204
make it permanent,


564
0:29:41,204 --> 0:29:44,65
if they get out of the way and pass the — pass the jobs bill,


565
0:29:44,65 --> 0:29:46,452
if they get out of the way and let us allow 14 million people


566
0:29:46,452 --> 0:29:50,619
who are struggling to stay in their homes because their mortgages are upside-down,


567
0:29:50,619 --> 0:29:53,972
but they never missed a mortgage payment — just get out of the way.


568
0:29:53,972 --> 0:29:56,899
Stop talking about how you care about people.


569
0:29:56,899 --> 0:29:59,747
Show me something. Show me a policy.


570
0:29:59,747 --> 0:30:3,107
Show me a policy where you take responsibility.


571
0:30:3,107 --> 0:30:5,993
And by the way, they talk about this Great Recession


572
0:30:5,993 --> 0:30:9,58
as if it fell out of the sky, like, oh my goodness, where did it come from?


573
0:30:9,58 --> 0:30:14,11
It came from this man voting to put 2 wars in a credit card,


574
0:30:14,11 --> 0:30:17,945
to at the same time put a prescription drug benefit on the credit card,


575
0:30:17,945 --> 0:30:21,179
a trillion- dollar tax cut for a — very wealthy.


576
0:30:21,179 --> 0:30:24,689
I was there. I voted against him. I said, no, we can't afford that.


577
0:30:24,689 --> 0:30:30,52
And now all of a sudden these guys are so seized with a concern about the debt


578
0:30:30,52 --> 0:30:31,297
that they created —


579
0:30:31,297 --> 0:30:33,874
[Raddatz] Congressman Ryan.


580
0:30:33,874 --> 0:30:38,478
[Ryan] Let's not forget that they came in with one-party control.


581
0:30:38,478 --> 0:30:40,995
When Barack Obama was elected, his party controlled everything.


582
0:30:40,995 --> 0:30:43,128
They had the ability to do everything of their choosing,


583
0:30:43,128 --> 0:30:45,736
and look at where we are right now.


584
0:30:45,736 --> 0:30:50,597
They passed a stimulus, the idea that we could borrow $831 billion,


585
0:30:50,597 --> 0:30:52,251
spend it on all these special interest groups


586
0:30:52,251 --> 0:30:53,967
and that it would work out just fine,


587
0:30:53,967 --> 0:30:56,338
that unemployment would never get to 8%.


588
0:30:56,338 --> 0:30:58,208
It went up above 8% for 43 months.


589
0:30:58,208 --> 0:31:0,677
They said that right now, if we just pass this stimulus,


590
0:31:0,677 --> 0:31:4,144
the economy would grow at 4%. It's growing at 1.3 (%).


591
0:31:4,144 --> 0:31:6,328
[Raddatz]: When could you get it below 6%?


592
0:31:6,328 --> 0:31:9,484
[Ryan] That's what our entire premise of our pro-growth plan


593
0:31:9,484 --> 0:31:11,92
for a stronger middle class is all about:


594
0:31:11,92 --> 0:31:13,161
getting the economy growing at 4%,


595
0:31:13,161 --> 0:31:15,765
creating 12 million jobs over the next 4 years.


596
0:31:15,765 --> 0:31:18,176
Look at just the $90 billion in stimulus,


597
0:31:18,176 --> 0:31:20,675
and — and the vice president was in charge of overseeing this,


598
0:31:20,675 --> 0:31:25,987
$90 billion in green pork to campaign contributors and special interest groups.


599
0:31:25,987 --> 0:31:30,781
There are just at the Department of Energy over 100 criminal investigations


600
0:31:30,781 --> 0:31:32,81
that have been launched into just how —


601
0:31:32,81 --> 0:31:32,581
[Biden] Martha —


602
0:31:32,581 --> 0:31:33,81
[Ryan] — stimulus — (inaudible) — are being spent —


603
0:31:33,81 --> 0:31:33,812
[Raddatz] Go ahead.


604
0:31:33,812 --> 0:31:34,481
Go ahead, Vice —


605
0:31:34,481 --> 0:31:37,274
[Biden] Martha, look. His colleague runs an investigative committee —


606
0:31:37,274 --> 0:31:38,205
[Ryan] Crony capitalism — (inaudible).


607
0:31:38,205 --> 0:31:39,764
[Biden] — spent months and months and months going into this —


608
0:31:39,764 --> 0:31:42,79
[Ryan] This is the — this is the inspector general.


609
0:31:42,79 --> 0:31:43,272
[Biden] — months and months.


610
0:31:43,272 --> 0:31:47,802
They found no evidence of cronyism. And I love my friend here.


611
0:31:47,802 --> 0:31:50,82
I — I'm not allowed to show letters, but go on our website:


612
0:31:50,82 --> 0:31:53,584
He sent me 2 letters saying, by the way,


613
0:31:53,584 --> 0:31:59,134
can you send me some stimulus money for companies here in the state of Wisconsin?


614
0:31:59,134 --> 0:32:1,619
We sent millions of dollars. You know why he said he needed —


615
0:32:1,619 --> 0:32:3,73
[Raddatz] You did ask for stimulus money, correct?


616
0:32:3,73 --> 0:32:3,988
[Biden] Sure he did. By the way — (inaudible) —


617
0:32:3,988 --> 0:32:8,28
[Ryan] On 2 occasions, we — we — we advocated for constituents who were applying for grants.


618
0:32:8,28 --> 0:32:9,205
[Biden] (Chuckles.)


619
0:32:9,205 --> 0:32:11,389
[Ryan] That's what we do. We do that for all constituents who are — (inaudible) — for grants.


620
0:32:11,389 --> 0:32:12,628
[Biden] I love that. I love that.


621
0:32:12,628 --> 0:32:16,189
This is such a bad program, and he writes me a letter saying


622
0:32:16,189 --> 0:32:17,951
— writes the Department of Energy a letter saying,


623
0:32:17,951 --> 0:32:21,891
the reason we need this stimulus — it will create growth and jobs.


624
0:32:21,891 --> 0:32:23,883
He — his words.


625
0:32:23,883 --> 0:32:27,762
And now he's sitting here looking at me — and by the way, that program


626
0:32:27,762 --> 0:32:32,185
— again, investigated — what the Congress said was, it was a model:


627
0:32:32,185 --> 0:32:37,161
less than 4/10 of 1% waste or fraud in the program.


628
0:32:37,161 --> 0:32:41,45
And all this talk about cronyism — they investigated and investigated;


629
0:32:41,45 --> 0:32:43,39
did not find one single piece of evidence.


630
0:32:43,39 --> 0:32:46,533
I wish he would just tell — be a little more candid.


631
0:32:46,533 --> 0:32:53,574
[Ryan] Was it a good idea to spend taxpayer dollars on electric cars in Finland or on windmills in China?


632
0:32:53,574 --> 0:32:54,412
[Biden] Look —


633
0:32:54,412 --> 0:32:57,324
[Ryan] Was it a good idea to borrow all this money from countries like China —


634
0:32:57,324 --> 0:32:58,224
[Biden] (Chuckles.)


635
0:32:58,224 --> 0:33:0,164
[Ryan] — and spend it on all these various different interest groups?


636
0:33:0,164 --> 0:33:2,209
[Biden] Let me tell you it was a good idea. It was a good idea


637
0:33:2,209 --> 0:33:5,52
— Moody's and others said that this was exactly what we needed


638
0:33:5,52 --> 0:33:7,174
that stopped us from going off the cliff.


639
0:33:7,174 --> 0:33:9,604
It set the conditions to be able to grow again.


640
0:33:9,604 --> 0:33:13,764
We have — in fact, 4% of those green jobs didn't go under


641
0:33:13,764 --> 0:33:15,65
— or went — went — went under — didn't work.


642
0:33:15,65 --> 0:33:18,3
It's a better batting average than investment bankers have.


643
0:33:18,3 --> 0:33:20,429
They have about a 40% — (inaudible) — loss.


644
0:33:20,429 --> 0:33:22,207
[Ryan] Where are the 5 million green jobs that were being promised —


645
0:33:22,207 --> 0:33:25,281
[Raddatz] I want to move on here to Medicare and entitlements.


646
0:33:25,281 --> 0:33:28,627
I think we've gone over this quite enough. And both —


647
0:33:28,627 --> 0:33:30,573
[Biden] And by the way, any letter you send me I'll entertain.


648
0:33:30,573 --> 0:33:33,725
[Ryan] I appreciate that, Joe. (Laughter.)


649
0:33:33,725 --> 0:33:35,747
[Raddatz] Let's talk about Medicare and entitlements.


650
0:33:35,747 --> 0:33:38,564
Both Medicare and Social Security are going broke


651
0:33:38,564 --> 0:33:41,398
and taking a larger share of the budget in the process.


652
0:33:41,398 --> 0:33:44,677
Will benefits for Americans under these programs


653
0:33:44,677 --> 0:33:49,124
have to change for the programs to survive, Mr. Ryan?


654
0:33:49,124 --> 0:33:51,145
[Ryan] Absolutely. Medicare and Social Security are going bankrupt.


655
0:33:51,145 --> 0:33:52,629
These are indisputable facts.


656
0:33:52,629 --> 0:33:57,295
Look, when I look at these programs, we've all had tragedies in our lives.


657
0:33:57,295 --> 0:34:0,814
I think about what they've done for my own family.


658
0:34:0,814 --> 0:34:4,519
My mom and I had my grandmother move in with us who was facing Alzheimer's.


659
0:34:4,519 --> 0:34:7,343
Medicare was there for her, just like it's there for my mom right now


660
0:34:7,343 --> 0:34:8,55
who's a Florida senior.


661
0:34:8,55 --> 0:34:12,39
After my dad died, my mom and I got Social Security survivors benefits.


662
0:34:12,39 --> 0:34:13,505
Helped me pay for college.


663
0:34:13,505 --> 0:34:15,645
It helped her go back to college in her 50s,


664
0:34:15,645 --> 0:34:19,465
where she started a small business because of the new skills she got.


665
0:34:19,465 --> 0:34:22,433
She paid all of her taxes on the promise


666
0:34:22,433 --> 0:34:24,823
that these programs would be there for her.


667
0:34:24,823 --> 0:34:26,261
We will honor this promise.


668
0:34:26,261 --> 0:34:29,11
And the best way to do it is reform it for my generation.


669
0:34:29,11 --> 0:34:34,129
You see, if you reform these programs for my generation, people 54 and below,


670
0:34:34,129 --> 0:34:37,56
you can guarantee they don't change for people in or near retirement,


671
0:34:37,56 --> 0:34:40,174
which is precisely what Mitt Romney and I are proposing.


672
0:34:40,174 --> 0:34:42,338
Look at what — look what "Obamacare" does.


673
0:34:42,338 --> 0:34:48,311
"Obamacare" takes $716 billion from Medicare to spend on "Obamacare."


674
0:34:48,311 --> 0:34:52,49
Even their own chief actuary at Medicare backs this up.


675
0:34:52,49 --> 0:34:54,83
He says you can't spend the same dollar twice.


676
0:34:54,83 --> 0:34:58,115
You can't claim that this money goes to Medicare and "Obamacare."


677
0:34:58,115 --> 0:35:0,92
And then they put this new "Obamacare" board


678
0:35:0,92 --> 0:35:2,913
in charge of cutting Medicare each and every year


679
0:35:2,913 --> 0:35:6,273
in ways that will lead to denied care for current seniors.


680
0:35:6,273 --> 0:35:8,142
This board, by the way, it's 15 people.


681
0:35:8,142 --> 0:35:10,34
The president's supposed to appoint them next year.


682
0:35:10,34 --> 0:35:13,99
And not one of them even has to have medical training.


683
0:35:13,99 --> 0:35:15,807
And Social Security, if we don't shore up Social Security,


684
0:35:15,807 --> 0:35:19,89
when we run out of the IOUs, when the program goes bankrupt,


685
0:35:19,89 --> 0:35:23,25
a 25% across-the-board benefit cut kicks in on current seniors


686
0:35:23,25 --> 0:35:24,565
in the middle of their retirement.


687
0:35:24,565 --> 0:35:26,557
We're going to stop that from happening.


688
0:35:26,557 --> 0:35:29,849
They haven't put a credible solution on the table.


689
0:35:29,849 --> 0:35:32,141
He'll tell you about vouchers.


690
0:35:32,141 --> 0:35:34,966
He'll say all these things to try and scare people.


691
0:35:34,966 --> 0:35:36,558
Here's what we're saying:


692
0:35:36,558 --> 0:35:39,853
Give younger people, when they become Medicare-eligible,


693
0:35:39,853 --> 0:35:43,356
guaranteed coverage options that you can't be denied,


694
0:35:43,356 --> 0:35:45,87
including traditional Medicare.


695
0:35:45,87 --> 0:35:47,874
Choose your plan, and then Medicare subsidizes your premiums,


696
0:35:47,874 --> 0:35:50,333
not as much for the wealthy people,


697
0:35:50,333 --> 0:35:51,91
more coverage for middle-income people


698
0:35:51,91 --> 0:35:54,665
and total out-of-pocket coverage for the poor and the sick.


699
0:35:54,665 --> 0:35:55,78
Choice and competition


700
0:35:55,78 --> 0:35:58,857
— we would rather have 50 million future seniors determine


701
0:35:58,857 --> 0:36:0,834
how their Medicare is delivered to them


702
0:36:0,834 --> 0:36:2,947
instead of 15 bureaucrats deciding what —


703
0:36:2,947 --> 0:36:4,355
if, where, when they get it.


704
0:36:4,355 --> 0:36:6,24
[Raddatz] Vice President Biden, 2 minutes.


705
0:36:6,24 --> 0:36:8,361
[Biden] You know, I heard that death panel argument from Sarah Palin.


706
0:36:8,361 --> 0:36:9,815
It seems that every vice presidential debate,


707
0:36:9,815 --> 0:36:14,53
I hear this kind of stuff about panels. But let's talk about Medicare.


708
0:36:14,53 --> 0:36:19,886
What we did is we saved $716 billion and put it back


709
0:36:19,886 --> 0:36:21,232
— applied it to Medicare.


710
0:36:21,232 --> 0:36:23,55
We cut the cost of Medicare.


711
0:36:23,55 --> 0:36:25,947
We stopped overpaying insurance companies


712
0:36:25,947 --> 0:36:29,692
when doctors and hospitals — the AMA supported what we did.


713
0:36:29,692 --> 0:36:36,276
AARP endorsed what we did. And it extends the life of Medicare to 2024.


714
0:36:36,276 --> 0:36:38,13
They want to wipe this all out.


715
0:36:38,13 --> 0:36:39,722
It also gave more benefits.


716
0:36:39,722 --> 0:36:44,91
Any senior out there, ask yourself: Do you have more benefits today?


717
0:36:44,91 --> 0:36:45,575
You do. If you're near the doughnut hole,


718
0:36:45,575 --> 0:36:49,693
you have $600 more to help your prescription drug costs.


719
0:36:49,693 --> 0:36:51,486
You get wellness visits without copays.


720
0:36:51,486 --> 0:36:54,44
They wipe all of this out, and Medicare goes —


721
0:36:54,44 --> 0:36:57,381
becomes insolvent in 2016, number 1.


722
0:36:57,381 --> 0:37:0,304
Number 2, guaranteed benefit — it's a voucher.


723
0:37:0,304 --> 0:37:2,635
When they first proposed


724
0:37:2,635 --> 0:37:4,938
— when the congressman had his first voucher program,


725
0:37:4,938 --> 0:37:11,44
the CBO said it would cost $6,400 a year, Martha,


726
0:37:11,44 --> 0:37:15,784
more for every senior 55 and below when they got there.


727
0:37:15,784 --> 0:37:19,574
He knew that, yet he got it — all the guys in Congress,


728
0:37:19,574 --> 0:37:21,99
and women in the Republican party to vote for it.


729
0:37:21,99 --> 0:37:27,7
Governor Romney, knowing that, said, I — I — I would sign it were I there.


730
0:37:27,7 --> 0:37:32,512
Who you believe, the AMA? Me? A guy who's fought his whole life for this?


731
0:37:32,512 --> 0:37:36,844
Or somebody who had actually put in motion a plan that knowingly cut


732
0:37:36,844 --> 0:37:42,194
— added $6,400 a year more to the cost of Medicare?


733
0:37:42,194 --> 0:37:46,318
Now they got a new plan. Trust me, it's not going to cost you any more.


734
0:37:46,318 --> 0:37:49,47
Folks, follow your instincts on this one.


735
0:37:49,47 --> 0:37:53,995
And with regard to Social Security, we will not — we will not privatize it.


736
0:37:53,995 --> 0:37:55,848
If we had listened to Romney,


737
0:37:55,848 --> 0:37:59,6
to Governor Romney and the congressman during the Bush years,


738
0:37:59,6 --> 0:38:2,271
imagine where all those seniors would be now


739
0:38:2,271 --> 0:38:3,94
if their money had been in the market.


740
0:38:3,94 --> 0:38:7,344
Their ideas are old, and their ideas are bad,


741
0:38:7,344 --> 0:38:10,69
and they eliminate the guarantee of Medicare.


742
0:38:10,69 --> 0:38:11,744
[Ryan] Here's the problem.


743
0:38:11,744 --> 0:38:14,51
They got caught with their hands in the cookie jar


744
0:38:14,51 --> 0:38:17,742
turning Medicare into a piggy bank for "Obamacare".


745
0:38:17,742 --> 0:38:21,3
Their own actuary from the administration came to Congress


746
0:38:21,3 --> 0:38:24,256
and said 1 out of 6 hospitals and nursing homes


747
0:38:24,256 --> 0:38:26,442
are going to go out of business as a result of this.


748
0:38:26,442 --> 0:38:27,373
[Biden] That's not what they said.


749
0:38:27,373 --> 0:38:29,397
[Ryan] 7.4 million seniors are projected


750
0:38:29,397 --> 0:38:32,105
to lose the current Medicare Advantage coverage they have.


751
0:38:32,105 --> 0:38:34,457
That's a $3,200 benefit cut.


752
0:38:34,457 --> 0:38:35,157
[Biden] That didn't happen.


753
0:38:35,157 --> 0:38:35,78
[Ryan] What we're saying —


754
0:38:35,78 --> 0:38:36,341
[Biden] More people signed up.


755
0:38:36,341 --> 0:38:37,841
[Ryan] These are from your own actuaries.


756
0:38:37,841 --> 0:38:40,353
[Biden] More — more — more people signed up for Medicare Advantage


757
0:38:40,353 --> 0:38:41,346
after the change.


758
0:38:41,346 --> 0:38:42,384
[Ryan] What — what they're —


759
0:38:42,384 --> 0:38:43,592
[Biden] No — nobody is getting shut down.


760
0:38:43,592 --> 0:38:44,615
[Ryan] Mr. Vice President, I know —


761
0:38:44,615 --> 0:38:45,5
[Biden] No — no — (inaudible) —


762
0:38:45,5 --> 0:38:47,476
[Ryan] Mr. Vice President, I know you're under a lot of duress


763
0:38:47,476 --> 0:38:48,115
[Biden laughs]


764
0:38:48,115 --> 0:38:49,94
[Ryan] to make up for lost ground 
[Biden laughs]


765
0:38:49,94 --> 0:38:51,456
but I think people would be better served


766
0:38:51,456 --> 0:38:52,74
if we don't keep interrupting each other.


767
0:38:52,74 --> 0:38:54,24
[Biden] Well, don't take all the 4 minutes, then.


768
0:38:54,24 --> 0:38:55,48
[Ryan] Now let me just — let me say this.


769
0:38:55,48 --> 0:38:58,663
We are not — we are saying, don't change benefits for people 55 and above.


770
0:38:58,663 --> 0:39:1,538
They already organized their retirement around these promises.


771
0:39:1,538 --> 0:39:2,484
[Biden] They already are —


772
0:39:2,484 --> 0:39:3,77
[Ryan] But you want to — (inaudible) — these programs for those of us —


773
0:39:3,77 --> 0:39:4,361
[Raddatz] Let me ask you this:


774
0:39:4,361 --> 0:39:8,213
what is your specific plan for seniors who really can't afford


775
0:39:8,213 --> 0:39:9,913
to make up the difference


776
0:39:9,913 --> 0:39:13,68
in the value of what you call a premium support plan


777
0:39:13,68 --> 0:39:14,553
and others call a voucher?


778
0:39:14,553 --> 0:39:15,668
[Ryan] 100% coverage for them.


779
0:39:15,668 --> 0:39:16,768
[Raddatz] And what —


780
0:39:16,768 --> 0:39:17,499
[Ryan] That's what we're saying.


781
0:39:17,499 --> 0:39:18,338
[Raddatz] — what would cost —


782
0:39:18,338 --> 0:39:19,238
[Ryan] So we're saying income-adjust —


783
0:39:19,238 --> 0:39:19,953
[Raddatz] How do you make that up?


784
0:39:19,953 --> 0:39:20,945
[Ryan] — these premium support payments


785
0:39:20,945 --> 0:39:23,527
by taking down the subsidies for wealthy people.


786
0:39:23,527 --> 0:39:26,574
Look, this is a plan — by the way,


787
0:39:26,574 --> 0:39:28,428
that $6,400 number, it was misleading then.


788
0:39:28,428 --> 0:39:32,56
It's totally inaccurate now. This is a plan that's bipartisan.


789
0:39:32,56 --> 0:39:35,613
It's a plan I put together with a prominent Democrat senator from Oregon.


790
0:39:35,613 --> 0:39:37,452
[Biden] There's not one Democrat who endorsed his —


791
0:39:37,452 --> 0:39:38,213
[Ryan] It's a plan —


792
0:39:38,213 --> 0:39:40,296
[Biden] — not one Democrat who signed his plan.


793
0:39:40,296 --> 0:39:41,919
[Ryan] Our partner is a Democrat from Oregon.


794
0:39:41,919 --> 0:39:44,124
[Biden] And he said he does no longer support (you for that ?).


795
0:39:44,124 --> 0:39:45,193
[Ryan] We — we put it — we put it together


796
0:39:45,193 --> 0:39:46,416
with the former Clinton budget director.


797
0:39:46,416 --> 0:39:47,947
[Biden] Who disavows it. (Chuckles.)


798
0:39:47,947 --> 0:39:52,222
[Ryan] This idea — this idea came from the Clinton commission to save Medicare,


799
0:39:52,222 --> 0:39:54,73
chaired by Senator John Breaux. Here's the point, Martha.


800
0:39:54,73 --> 0:39:55,907
[Biden] Which was rejected.


801
0:39:55,907 --> 0:39:58,38
[Ryan] If we don't — if we don't fix this problem pretty soon,


802
0:39:58,38 --> 0:40:5,586
then current seniors get cut! Here's the problem. 10,000 people


803
0:40:5,586 --> 0:40:6,328
and they will for 20 years.


804
0:40:6,328 --> 0:40:7,952
That's not a political thing. That's a math thing.


805
0:40:7,952 --> 0:40:9,99
[Biden] Martha, if we just did one thing, if we just —


806
0:40:9,99 --> 0:40:15,39
if they allow Medicare to bargain for the cost of drugs like Medicaid can,


807
0:40:15,39 --> 0:40:19,798
that would save $156 billion right off the bat.


808
0:40:19,798 --> 0:40:21,175
[Ryan] And it would deny seniors choices.


809
0:40:21,175 --> 0:40:22,916
[Biden] All — all — all —


810
0:40:22,916 --> 0:40:23,754
[Ryan] It — it has restricted (formula ?) —


811
0:40:23,754 --> 0:40:24,947
[Biden] Seniors are not denied.


812
0:40:24,947 --> 0:40:25,585
[Ryan] Absolutely.


813
0:40:25,585 --> 0:40:26,87
[Biden] Sorry, they are not denied.


814
0:40:26,87 --> 0:40:29,644
Look, folks, and all you seniors out there,


815
0:40:29,644 --> 0:40:31,82
are you being denied choices?


816
0:40:31,82 --> 0:40:33,601
Have you lost Medicare Advantage or, if you have signed up —


817
0:40:33,601 --> 0:40:34,27
[Ryan] Because it's working well right now.


818
0:40:34,27 --> 0:40:35,232
[Biden] Because we changed the law!


819
0:40:35,232 --> 0:40:36,578
[Raddatz] Vice President Biden, let me ask you,


820
0:40:36,578 --> 0:40:38,774
if it could help solve the problem,


821
0:40:38,774 --> 0:40:43,735
why not very slowly raise the Medicare eligibility age by 2 years,


822
0:40:43,735 --> 0:40:45,435
as Congressman Ryan suggests?


823
0:40:45,435 --> 0:40:50,112
[Biden] Look, I was there when we did that with Social Security, in 1983.


824
0:40:50,112 --> 0:40:52,89
I was 1 of 8 people sitting in the room


825
0:40:52,89 --> 0:40:56,138
that included Tip O'Neill negotiating with President Reagan.


826
0:40:56,138 --> 0:40:57,99
We all got together, and everybody said,


827
0:40:57,99 --> 0:41:1,417
as long as everybody's in the deal, everybody's in the deal,


828
0:41:1,417 --> 0:41:4,343
and everybody is making some sacrifice, we can find a way.


829
0:41:4,343 --> 0:41:8,422
We made the system solvent to 2033.


830
0:41:8,422 --> 0:41:14,97
We will not, though, be part of any voucher plan eliminating


831
0:41:14,97 --> 0:41:18,407
— the voucher says, Mom, when you're — when you're 65, go out there,


832
0:41:18,407 --> 0:41:21,263
shop for the best insurance you can get; you're out of Medicare.


833
0:41:21,263 --> 0:41:24,3
You can buy back in, if you want, with this voucher,


834
0:41:24,3 --> 0:41:27,838
which will not keep pace — will not keep pace with health care costs,


835
0:41:27,838 --> 0:41:30,375
because if it did keep pace with health care costs,


836
0:41:30,375 --> 0:41:31,722
there would be no savings.


837
0:41:31,722 --> 0:41:34,716
That's why they go the voucher — they —


838
0:41:34,716 --> 0:41:41,307
we will be no part of a voucher program or the privatization of Social Security.


839
0:41:41,307 --> 0:41:42,899
[Ryan] A voucher is you go to your mailbox,


840
0:41:42,899 --> 0:41:45,766
get a check and buy something. Nobody's proposing that.


841
0:41:45,766 --> 0:41:49,768
Barack Obama, 4 years ago, running for president, said


842
0:41:49,768 --> 0:41:54,522
if you don't have any fresh ideas, use stale tactics to scare voters.


843
0:41:54,522 --> 0:41:57,6
If you don't have a good record to run on,


844
0:41:57,6 --> 0:41:59,883
paint your opponent as someone people should run from.


845
0:41:59,883 --> 0:42:1,167
Make a big election about small ideas.


846
0:42:1,167 --> 0:42:4,457
[Raddatz] You were one of the few lawmakers to stand with President Bush


847
0:42:4,457 --> 0:42:7,271
when he was seeking to partially privatize Social Security.


848
0:42:7,271 --> 0:42:8,263
[Ryan] For younger people.


849
0:42:8,263 --> 0:42:11,46
What we said then and what I've always agreed is


850
0:42:11,46 --> 0:42:14,524
let younger Americans have a voluntary choice


851
0:42:14,524 --> 0:42:17,999
of making their money work faster for them within the Social Security system.


852
0:42:17,999 --> 0:42:18,822
[Biden] You saw how well that worked.


853
0:42:18,822 --> 0:42:19,846
[Ryan] That's not what Mitt Romney's proposing.


854
0:42:19,846 --> 0:42:23,559
What we're saying is no changes for anybody 55 and above.


855
0:42:23,559 --> 0:42:24,874
[Biden] What Mitt Romney is proposing —


856
0:42:24,874 --> 0:42:26,627
[Ryan] And then the kinds of the changes we're talking about


857
0:42:26,627 --> 0:42:28,799
for younger people like myself is


858
0:42:28,799 --> 0:42:31,876
don't increase the benefits for wealthy people as fast as everybody else —


859
0:42:31,876 --> 0:42:32,914
[Biden] Martha —


860
0:42:32,914 --> 0:42:34,676
[Ryan] — slowly raise the retirement age over time.


861
0:42:34,676 --> 0:42:36,545
[Ryan] It wouldn't get to the age of 70 until the year 2103,


862
0:42:36,545 --> 0:42:37,968
[Biden] Martha -


863
0:42:37,968 --> 0:42:39,499
[Ryan] according to the actuaries.


864
0:42:39,499 --> 0:42:40,353
Now, here's the issue.


865
0:42:40,353 --> 0:42:41,576
[Raddatz] Quickly, Vice President.


866
0:42:41,576 --> 0:42:44,795
[Biden] Quickly, the bottom line here is that all the studies show that


867
0:42:44,795 --> 0:42:48,147
if we went with Social Security proposal made by Mitt Romney,


868
0:42:48,147 --> 0:42:52,351
if you're 40 — in your 40s now, you will pay $2,600 a year —


869
0:42:52,351 --> 0:42:55,132
you get $2,600 a year less in Social Security.


870
0:42:55,132 --> 0:42:58,303
If you're in your 20s now, you get $4,700 a year less.


871
0:42:58,303 --> 0:43:0,809
The idea of changing


872
0:43:0,809 --> 0:43:4,35
— and change being, in this case, to cut the benefits for people


873
0:43:4,35 --> 0:43:7,467
without taking other action you could do to make it work —


874
0:43:7,467 --> 0:43:9,106
is absolutely the wrong way.


875
0:43:9,106 --> 0:43:13,362
These — look, these guys haven't been big on Medicare from the beginning.


876
0:43:13,362 --> 0:43:16,343
Their party's not been big on Medicare from the beginning.


877
0:43:16,343 --> 0:43:19,705
And they've always been about Social Security as little as you can do.


878
0:43:19,705 --> 0:43:24,29
Look, folks, use your common sense. Who do you trust on this?


879
0:43:24,29 --> 0:43:29,567
A man who introduced a bill that would raise it $6,400 a year,


880
0:43:29,567 --> 0:43:33,466
knowing it and passing it, and Romney saying he'd sign it?


881
0:43:33,466 --> 0:43:34,75
Or me and the president?


882
0:43:34,75 --> 0:43:36,926
[Ryan] That statistic was completely misleading.


883
0:43:36,926 --> 0:43:37,719
But more importantly —


884
0:43:37,719 --> 0:43:38,757
[Biden] That's — there are the facts, right?


885
0:43:38,757 --> 0:43:40,165
[Ryan] — this is — this is what politicians do


886
0:43:40,165 --> 0:43:41,65
when they don't have a record to run on:


887
0:43:41,65 --> 0:43:44,878
try to scare people from voting for you.


888
0:43:44,878 --> 0:43:48,343
If you don't get ahead of this problem, it's going to — (inaudible) —


889
0:43:48,343 --> 0:43:50,12
[Biden] Medicare beneficiaries have more benefits now — (inaudible) —


890
0:43:50,12 --> 0:43:50,82
[Ryan] We are not going to run away — we are not going to run away —


891
0:43:50,82 --> 0:43:51,92
[Raddatz] OK. We're going to —


892
0:43:51,92 --> 0:43:53,389
we're going to move on to a very simple question to you both.


893
0:43:53,389 --> 0:43:55,825
[Ryan] Medicare and Social Security did so much for my own family.


894
0:43:55,825 --> 0:43:58,344
We are not going to jeopardize this program,


895
0:43:58,344 --> 0:44:1,307
but we have to save it for the next generation so it doesn't go bankrupt.


896
0:44:1,307 --> 0:44:2,84
[Biden] You are jeopardizing the program.


897
0:44:2,84 --> 0:44:5,967
You're changing the program from a guaranteed benefit to a premium support.


898
0:44:5,967 --> 0:44:7,313
Whatever you call it, the bottom line is


899
0:44:7,313 --> 0:44:9,736
people are going to have to pay more money out of their pocket.


900
0:44:9,736 --> 0:44:10,513
[Biden] And the families -


901
0:44:10,513 --> 0:44:12,244
[Ryan] The wealthy would.
[Biden] -  I know and the families I come from


902
0:44:12,244 --> 0:44:14,686
— they don't have the money to pay more out of — (inaudible).


903
0:44:14,686 --> 0:44:15,74
[Raddatz] Gentlemen, gentlemen —


904
0:44:15,74 --> 0:44:16,68
[Ryan] That's why we're saying more for lower-income people


905
0:44:16,68 --> 0:44:18,41
and less for higher-income people.


906
0:44:18,41 --> 0:44:20,986
[Raddatz] I would like to move on to a very simple question for both of you.


907
0:44:20,986 --> 0:44:22,763
And something tells me —


908
0:44:22,763 --> 0:44:23,478
[Biden chuckles.]


909
0:44:23,478 --> 0:44:26,392
[Raddatz] — I won't get a very simple answer. But let me ask you this.


910
0:44:26,392 --> 0:44:29,207
[Biden] I gave you a simple answer: He's raising the cost of Medicare.


911
0:44:29,207 --> 0:44:30,907
[Raddatz] OK, on to taxes.


912
0:44:30,907 --> 0:44:34,482
If your ticket is elected, who will pay more in taxes?


913
0:44:34,482 --> 0:44:35,705
Who will pay less?


914
0:44:35,705 --> 0:44:38,342
And we're starting with Vice President Biden for 2 minutes.


915
0:44:38,342 --> 0:44:39,996
[Biden] The middle class will pay less,


916
0:44:39,996 --> 0:44:41,803
and people making a million dollars or more


917
0:44:41,803 --> 0:44:43,518
will begin to contribute slightly more.


918
0:44:43,518 --> 0:44:45,464
Let me give you 1 concrete example:


919
0:44:45,464 --> 0:44:48,45
the continuation of the Bush tax cuts.


920
0:44:48,45 --> 0:44:50,602
We're arguing that the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy


921
0:44:50,602 --> 0:44:52,71
should be allowed to expire.


922
0:44:52,71 --> 0:44:56,24
Of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, 800 million


923
0:44:56,24 --> 0:44:57,817
— billion dollars of that goes to people


924
0:44:57,817 --> 0:44:59,993
making a minimum of a million dollars.


925
0:44:59,993 --> 0:45:3,773
We see no justification in these economic times for those


926
0:45:3,773 --> 0:45:5,658
— and they're patriotic Americans.


927
0:45:5,658 --> 0:45:8,73
They're — they're not asking for this continued tax cut;


928
0:45:8,73 --> 0:45:10,107
they're not suggesting it;


929
0:45:10,107 --> 0:45:11,669
but my friends are insisting on it.


930
0:45:11,669 --> 0:45:16,165
A hundred and twenty thousand families, by continuing that tax cut,


931
0:45:16,165 --> 0:45:21,892
will get an additional $500 billion in tax relief in the next 10 years,


932
0:45:21,892 --> 0:45:24,515
and their income is an average of $8 million.


933
0:45:24,515 --> 0:45:28,364
We want to extend permanently the middle-class tax cut for


934
0:45:28,364 --> 0:45:31,969
— permanently from the Bush middle-class tax cut.


935
0:45:31,969 --> 0:45:33,853
These guys won't allow us to.


936
0:45:33,853 --> 0:45:35,815
You know what we're saying? We say let's have a vote.


937
0:45:35,815 --> 0:45:38,87
Let's have a vote on the middle-class tax cut,


938
0:45:38,87 --> 0:45:40,22
and let's have a vote on the upper tax cut.


939
0:45:40,22 --> 0:45:42,656
Let's go ahead and vote on it. They're saying no.


940
0:45:42,656 --> 0:45:47,812
They're holding hostage the middle-class tax cut to the super wealthy.


941
0:45:47,812 --> 0:45:48,635
And on top of that,


942
0:45:48,635 --> 0:45:51,967
they got another tax cut coming that's $5 trillion


943
0:45:51,967 --> 0:45:54,811
that all of the studies point out will, in fact,


944
0:45:54,811 --> 0:45:58,562
give another $250 million dollar —


945
0:45:58,562 --> 0:46:1,878
yeah, $250,000 a year to those 120,000 families


946
0:46:1,878 --> 0:46:5,728
and raise taxes for people who are middle-income


947
0:46:5,728 --> 0:46:9,199
with a child by $2,000 a year.


948
0:46:9,199 --> 0:46:10,392
This is unconscionable.


949
0:46:10,392 --> 0:46:12,461
There is no need for this.


950
0:46:12,461 --> 0:46:14,944
The middle class got knocked on their heels.


951
0:46:14,944 --> 0:46:17,14
The Great Recession crushed them.


952
0:46:17,14 --> 0:46:19,13
They need some help now.


953
0:46:19,13 --> 0:46:22,932
The last people who need help are 120,000 families


954
0:46:22,932 --> 0:46:29,855
for another — another $500 billion tax cut over the next 10 years.


955
0:46:29,855 --> 0:46:32,47
[Raddatz] Congressman.


956
0:46:32,47 --> 0:46:35,0
[Ryan] Our entire premise of these tax reform plans


957
0:46:35,0 --> 0:46:37,472
is to grow the economy and create jobs.


958
0:46:37,472 --> 0:46:39,865
It's a plan that's estimated to create 7 million jobs.


959
0:46:39,865 --> 0:46:44,942
Now, we think that government taking 28%


960
0:46:44,942 --> 0:46:47,364
of a family and business' income is enough.


961
0:46:47,364 --> 0:46:50,489
President Obama thinks that the government ought to be able


962
0:46:50,489 --> 0:46:54,796
to take as much as 44.8% of a small business' income.


963
0:46:54,796 --> 0:46:59,675
Look, if you taxed every person in successful small business


964
0:46:59,675 --> 0:47:2,813
making over $250,000 at 100%,


965
0:47:2,813 --> 0:47:5,46
it'd only run the government for 98 days.


966
0:47:5,46 --> 0:47:7,948
If everybody who paid income taxes last year,


967
0:47:7,948 --> 0:47:9,571
including successful small businesses,


968
0:47:9,571 --> 0:47:11,455
doubled their income taxes this year,


969
0:47:11,455 --> 0:47:13,677
we'd still have a $300 billion deficit.


970
0:47:13,677 --> 0:47:18,537
You see, there aren't enough rich people and small businesses to tax


971
0:47:18,537 --> 0:47:20,734
to pay for all their spending.


972
0:47:20,734 --> 0:47:24,227
And so the next time you hear them say, don't worry about it,


973
0:47:24,227 --> 0:47:26,803
we'll get a few wealthy people to pay their fair share,


974
0:47:26,803 --> 0:47:31,128
watch out, middle class. The tax bill is coming to you.


975
0:47:31,128 --> 0:47:34,264
That's why we're saying we need fundamental tax reform.


976
0:47:34,264 --> 0:47:35,733
Let's take a look at it this way:


977
0:47:35,733 --> 0:47:39,31
8-out-of-10 businesses, they file their taxes as individuals,


978
0:47:39,31 --> 0:47:40,226
not as corporations.


979
0:47:40,226 --> 0:47:42,302
And where I come from, overseas,


980
0:47:42,302 --> 0:47:43,541
which is Lake Superior [chuckles]


981
0:47:43,541 --> 0:47:47,94
the Canadians — they drop their tax rates to 15%.


982
0:47:47,94 --> 0:47:50,897
The average tax rate on businesses in the industrialized world


983
0:47:50,897 --> 0:47:51,997
is 25%,


984
0:47:51,997 --> 0:47:55,245
and the president wants the top effective tax rate


985
0:47:55,245 --> 0:47:58,494
on successful small businesses to go above 40%.


986
0:47:58,494 --> 0:48:1,501
2/3 of our jobs come from small businesses.


987
0:48:1,501 --> 0:48:7,122
This one tax would actually tax about 53% of small-business income.


988
0:48:7,122 --> 0:48:10,312
It's expected that'd cost us 710,000 jobs.


989
0:48:10,312 --> 0:48:11,689
And you know what?


990
0:48:11,689 --> 0:48:16,98
It doesn't even pay for 10% of their proposed deficit spending increases.


991
0:48:16,98 --> 0:48:21,65
What we are saying is: lower tax rates across the board and close loopholes,


992
0:48:21,65 --> 0:48:22,919
primarily to the higher-income people.


993
0:48:22,919 --> 0:48:24,619
We have 3 bottom lines:


994
0:48:24,619 --> 0:48:26,427
Don't raise the deficit,


995
0:48:26,427 --> 0:48:28,536
don't raise taxes on the middle class


996
0:48:28,536 --> 0:48:32,592
and don't lower the share of income that is borne by the high-income earners.


997
0:48:32,592 --> 0:48:35,378
He — he'll keep saying this $5 trillion plan, I suppose —


998
0:48:35,378 --> 0:48:35,97
[Biden chuckles]


999
0:48:35,97 --> 0:48:38,53
[Ryan] — it's been discredited by six other studies,


1000
0:48:38,53 --> 0:48:41,91
and even their own deputy campaign manager acknowledged


1001
0:48:41,91 --> 0:48:42,638
that it wasn't correct.


1002
0:48:42,638 --> 0:48:44,23
[Raddatz] Well, let's talk about this 20%.


1003
0:48:44,23 --> 0:48:45,68
[Biden] Well — (chuckles) —


1004
0:48:45,68 --> 0:48:48,519
[Raddatz] You have refused yet again to offer specifics


1005
0:48:48,519 --> 0:48:53,444
on how you pay for that 20% across-the-board tax cut.


1006
0:48:53,444 --> 0:48:58,47
Do you actually have the specifics, or are you still working on it,


1007
0:48:58,47 --> 0:49:0,24
and that's why you won't tell voters?


1008
0:49:0,24 --> 0:49:1,801
[Ryan] Different than this administration,


1009
0:49:1,801 --> 0:49:4,314
we actually want to have big bipartisan agreements.


1010
0:49:4,314 --> 0:49:5,737
You see, I understand the —


1011
0:49:5,737 --> 0:49:6,944
[Raddatz] Do you have the specifics?


1012
0:49:6,944 --> 0:49:7,752
Do you have the math?


1013
0:49:7,752 --> 0:49:8,883
Do you know exactly what you're doing?


1014
0:49:8,883 --> 0:49:9,814
[Biden] That'll be — that'd be a first for the Republican Congress.


1015
0:49:9,814 --> 0:49:10,975
[Ryan] Look — look at what Mitt —


1016
0:49:10,975 --> 0:49:13,188
look at what Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill did.


1017
0:49:13,188 --> 0:49:16,303
They worked together out of a framework to lower tax rates


1018
0:49:16,303 --> 0:49:19,704
and broaden the base, and they worked together to fix that.


1019
0:49:19,704 --> 0:49:22,275
What we're saying is here's our framework:


1020
0:49:22,275 --> 0:49:23,883
Lower tax rates 20% —


1021
0:49:23,883 --> 0:49:27,266
we raise about $1.2 trillion through income taxes.


1022
0:49:27,266 --> 0:49:31,347
We forgo about 1.1 trillion (dollars) in loopholes and deductions.


1023
0:49:31,347 --> 0:49:34,725
And so what we're saying is deny those loopholes and deductions


1024
0:49:34,725 --> 0:49:38,902
to higher- income taxpayers so that more of their income is taxed,


1025
0:49:38,902 --> 0:49:40,356
which has a broader base of taxation —


1026
0:49:40,356 --> 0:49:41,364
[Biden] Can I translate?


1027
0:49:41,364 --> 0:49:43,79
[Ryan] — so we can lower tax rates across the board.


1028
0:49:43,79 --> 0:49:45,71
Now, here's why I'm saying this.


1029
0:49:45,71 --> 0:49:46,51
What we're saying is here's a framework —


1030
0:49:46,51 --> 0:49:47,271
[Biden] I hope I'm going to get time to respond to this.


1031
0:49:47,271 --> 0:49:48,248
[Ryan] We want to work with Congress —


1032
0:49:48,248 --> 0:49:49,241
[Raddatz] I — you'll get time.


1033
0:49:49,241 --> 0:49:51,553
[Ryan] We want to work with Congress on how best to achieve this.


1034
0:49:51,553 --> 0:49:53,33
That means successful — look —


1035
0:49:53,33 --> 0:49:54,399
[Raddatz] No specifics, yeah.


1036
0:49:54,399 --> 0:49:56,477
[Ryan] Mitt — what we're saying is


1037
0:49:56,477 --> 0:49:59,282
lower tax rates 20%, start with the wealthy,


1038
0:49:59,282 --> 0:50:0,52
work with Congress to do it —


1039
0:50:0,52 --> 0:50:1,959
[Raddatz] And you guarantee this math will add up.


1040
0:50:1,959 --> 0:50:4,198
[Ryan] Absolutely. Six studies have guaranteed


1041
0:50:4,198 --> 0:50:6,301
— six studies have verified that this math adds up,


1042
0:50:6,301 --> 0:50:6,801
but here's the other point —


1043
0:50:6,801 --> 0:50:7,301
[Raddatz] Vice President Biden —


1044
0:50:7,301 --> 0:50:7,801
[Biden] Look —


1045
0:50:7,801 --> 0:50:8,301
[Ryan] (Inaudible) — one point — (inaudible) —


1046
0:50:8,301 --> 0:50:9,124
[Raddatz] Vice President Biden.


1047
0:50:9,124 --> 0:50:10,901
[Biden] Let me translate. Let me have a chance to translate.


1048
0:50:10,901 --> 0:50:11,832
[Ryan] I'll come back in a second then, right?


1049
0:50:11,832 --> 0:50:14,114
[Biden] First of all, I was there when Ronald Reagan tax breaks


1050
0:50:14,114 --> 0:50:16,425
— I mean, he gave specifics of what he was going to cut -


1051
0:50:16,425 --> 0:50:19,64
No, number 1, in terms of tax expenditures.


1052
0:50:19,64 --> 0:50:24,165
Number 2, 97% of the small businesses of America pay less


1053
0:50:24,165 --> 0:50:26,77
— make less than $250,000.


1054
0:50:26,77 --> 0:50:29,107
Let me tell you who some of those other small businesses are:


1055
0:50:29,107 --> 0:50:33,179
hedge funds that make 6, 800 million dollars a year.


1056
0:50:33,179 --> 0:50:35,512
That — that's what they count as small business


1057
0:50:35,512 --> 0:50:36,828
because they're passthrough.


1058
0:50:36,828 --> 0:50:38,743
Let's look at how sincere they are.


1059
0:50:38,743 --> 0:50:42,233
Ronald — I mean, excuse me, Governor Romney, on "60 Minutes,"


1060
0:50:42,233 --> 0:50:43,886
I guess it's about 10 days ago,


1061
0:50:43,886 --> 0:50:47,835
was asked, Governor, you pay 14% on $20 million.


1062
0:50:47,835 --> 0:50:50,837
Someone making $50,000 pays more than that.


1063
0:50:50,837 --> 0:50:51,921
Do you think that's fair?


1064
0:50:51,921 --> 0:50:54,142
He said, oh, yes, that's fair; that's fair.


1065
0:50:54,142 --> 0:50:56,15
This is — and they're going to talk —


1066
0:50:56,15 --> 0:50:57,654
I mean, you think these guys are going to go out there


1067
0:50:57,654 --> 0:50:59,523
and cut those loopholes?


1068
0:50:59,523 --> 0:51:1,666
The loophole — the biggest loophole they take advantage of


1069
0:51:1,666 --> 0:51:3,258
is the carried interest loophole and —


1070
0:51:3,258 --> 0:51:4,85
and capital gains loophole.


1071
0:51:4,85 --> 0:51:6,535
They exempt that.


1072
0:51:6,535 --> 0:51:9,494
Now, there's not enough — the reason why the AEI study,


1073
0:51:9,494 --> 0:51:11,515
the American Enterprise Institute study,


1074
0:51:11,515 --> 0:51:13,53
the Tax Policy Center study,


1075
0:51:13,53 --> 0:51:15,786
the reason they all say it's going to


1076
0:51:15,786 --> 0:51:17,225
— taxes will go up on the middle class,


1077
0:51:17,225 --> 0:51:22,383
the only way you can find $5 trillion in loopholes


1078
0:51:22,383 --> 0:51:25,583
is cut the mortgage deduction for middle-class people,


1079
0:51:25,583 --> 0:51:27,746
cut the health care deduction for middle-class people,


1080
0:51:27,746 --> 0:51:31,472
take away their ability to get a tax break to send their kids to college.


1081
0:51:31,472 --> 0:51:32,433
That's why they — (inaudible) —


1082
0:51:32,433 --> 0:51:33,856
[Raddatz] Is he wrong about that?


1083
0:51:33,856 --> 0:51:35,819
[Ryan] He is wrong about that. There are — you can —


1084
0:51:35,819 --> 0:51:36,519
[Biden] How's that?


1085
0:51:36,519 --> 0:51:38,968
[Ryan] You can cut tax rates by 20% and still preserve


1086
0:51:38,968 --> 0:51:41,504
these important preferences for middle-class taxpayers —


1087
0:51:41,504 --> 0:51:42,943
[Biden] Not mathematically possible.


1088
0:51:42,943 --> 0:51:46,4
[Ryan] It is mathematically possible. It's been done before.


1089
0:51:46,4 --> 0:51:47,309
It's precisely what we're proposing.


1090
0:51:47,309 --> 0:51:48,917
[Biden] (Chuckles.) It has never been done before.


1091
0:51:48,917 --> 0:51:50,409
[Ryan] It's been done a couple of times, actually.


1092
0:51:50,409 --> 0:51:51,539
[Biden] It has never been done before.


1093
0:51:51,539 --> 0:51:53,439
[Ryan] Jack Kennedy lowered tax rates, increased growth. Ronald Reagan -


1094
0:51:53,439 --> 0:51:54,786
[Biden] Oh, now you're Jack Kennedy.


1095
0:51:54,786 --> 0:51:56,214
[Ryan] Ronald Reagan


1096
0:51:56,214 --> 0:51:57,976
[Ryan laughs and chuckles


1097
0:51:57,976 --> 0:51:59,476
Republicans and Democrats —
[Biden] This is amazing.


1098
0:51:59,476 --> 0:52:2,425
[Ryan] Republicans and Democrats have worked together on this.


1099
0:52:2,425 --> 0:52:2,925
[Biden] That's right.


1100
0:52:2,925 --> 0:52:4,947
[Ryan] I understand aren't used to doing bipartisan deals.


1101
0:52:4,947 --> 0:52:5,878
[Biden] But we told each other what we were going to do.


1102
0:52:5,878 --> 0:52:6,747
When we did with Reagan, he said —


1103
0:52:6,747 --> 0:52:7,986
[Ryan] Republicans and Democrats —


1104
0:52:7,986 --> 0:52:8,886
[Biden] — here — here are the things we're going to cut.


1105
0:52:8,886 --> 0:52:9,386
This is what he said.
[Ryan] We can agree on a framework;


1106
0:52:9,386 --> 0:52:11,44
let's work together to fill in the details. That's exactly —


1107
0:52:11,44 --> 0:52:11,94
[Biden] Fill in the details.


1108
0:52:11,94 --> 0:52:13,898
[Ryan] That's how you get things done. You work with Congress —


1109
0:52:13,898 --> 0:52:14,398
[Biden] (Seriously?).


1110
0:52:14,398 --> 0:52:15,867
[Ryan] Look, let me say it this way. Mitt Romney was governor —


1111
0:52:15,867 --> 0:52:19,665
[Biden] That's coming from the Republican Congress working bipartisanly?


1112
0:52:19,665 --> 0:52:20,611
[Ryan] Mitt — Mitt Romney —


1113
0:52:20,611 --> 0:52:22,188
[Biden] 7% rating? Come on.


1114
0:52:22,188 --> 0:52:24,226
[Ryan] Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts,


1115
0:52:24,226 --> 0:52:27,58
where 87% of the legislators he served with were Democrats.


1116
0:52:27,58 --> 0:52:30,213
He didn't demonize them. He didn't demagogue them.


1117
0:52:30,213 --> 0:52:32,51
He met with those party leaders every week.


1118
0:52:32,51 --> 0:52:32,582
[Biden chuckles]


1119
0:52:32,582 --> 0:52:35,325
[Ryan] He reached across the aisle. He didn't compromise principles.


1120
0:52:35,325 --> 0:52:36,287
[Biden] And you saw what happened (?).


1121
0:52:36,287 --> 0:52:37,725
[Ryan] He found common ground, and he balanced the budget.


1122
0:52:37,725 --> 0:52:39,395
[Biden] You saw it (?) — if he did such a great job —


1123
0:52:39,395 --> 0:52:40,156
if he did such a great job in Massachusetts —


1124
0:52:40,156 --> 0:52:40,979
[Raddatz] Vice President, what —


1125
0:52:40,979 --> 0:52:42,11
[Ryan] He balanced the budget 4 times.


1126
0:52:42,11 --> 0:52:42,61
He balanced the budget 4 times without raising taxes.


1127
0:52:42,61 --> 0:52:44,286
[Biden] — why isn't he even contesting Massachusetts?


1128
0:52:44,286 --> 0:52:44,786
[Ryan] (Inaudible.)


1129
0:52:44,786 --> 0:52:47,43
[Raddatz] Vice President, what would you suggest —


1130
0:52:47,43 --> 0:52:49,649
what would you suggest beyond raising taxes on the wealthy


1131
0:52:49,649 --> 0:52:52,97
that would substantially reduce the long-term deficit?


1132
0:52:52,97 --> 0:52:53,731
[Biden] Not — just let the taxes expire


1133
0:52:53,731 --> 0:52:56,858
like they're supposed to on those millionaires.


1134
0:52:56,858 --> 0:53:0,424
We don't — we can't afford $800 billion


1135
0:53:0,424 --> 0:53:3,842
going to people making a minimum a million dollars.


1136
0:53:3,842 --> 0:53:10,145
They do not need it, Martha. Those 120,000 families make $8 million a year.


1137
0:53:10,145 --> 0:53:12,598
Middle-class people need the help.


1138
0:53:12,598 --> 0:53:15,515
Why does my friend cut out the tuition tax credit for them?


1139
0:53:15,515 --> 0:53:17,411
Why does he go out after the child — (inaudible)?


1140
0:53:17,411 --> 0:53:18,634
[Raddatz] Can you declare anything off-limits —


1141
0:53:18,634 --> 0:53:19,534
[Biden] Why do they do that?


1142
0:53:19,534 --> 0:53:21,342
[Raddatz] Can you declare anything off limits?


1143
0:53:21,342 --> 0:53:22,319
Home mortgages deductions —


1144
0:53:22,319 --> 0:53:23,778
[Ryan] Yeah. We're saying close loopholes on high-interest people—


1145
0:53:23,778 --> 0:53:24,924
[Raddatz] Home mortgage deductions —


1146
0:53:24,924 --> 0:53:26,316
[Ryan] — for higher-income people. Here —


1147
0:53:26,316 --> 0:53:27,893
[Biden] Can you guarantee that no one —


1148
0:53:27,893 --> 0:53:28,562
[Ryan] This taxes —


1149
0:53:28,562 --> 0:53:31,9
[Biden] — making less than $100,000 will have a mortgage —


1150
0:53:31,9 --> 0:53:31,636
[Ryan] This —


1151
0:53:31,636 --> 0:53:33,143
[Biden] — their mortgage deduction impacted? Guarantee?


1152
0:53:33,143 --> 0:53:34,993
[Ryan] This taxes a million small businesses.


1153
0:53:34,993 --> 0:53:36,154
He keeps trying to make you think


1154
0:53:36,154 --> 0:53:39,388
that it's just some movie star or hedge fund guy or an actor—


1155
0:53:39,388 --> 0:53:41,373
[Biden] 97% of the small businesses


1156
0:53:41,373 --> 0:53:44,986
make less than $250,000 a year —


1157
0:53:44,986 --> 0:53:45,501
[Ryan] Joe —


1158
0:53:45,501 --> 0:53:46,663
[Biden] — would not be affected.


1159
0:53:46,663 --> 0:53:48,178
[Ryan] — you know, it hits a million —


1160
0:53:48,178 --> 0:53:50,705
this taxes a million people, a million small businesses —


1161
0:53:50,705 --> 0:53:53,507
[Biden] Doesn't tax 97% of the American businesses


1162
0:53:53,507 --> 0:53:54,7
— small businesses —


1163
0:53:54,7 --> 0:53:55,23
[Ryan] It — it taxes a million small businesses,


1164
0:53:55,23 --> 0:53:56,484
who are our great job creators.


1165
0:53:56,484 --> 0:53:57,553
[Biden] I wish I'd get it —


1166
0:53:57,553 --> 0:53:58,145
the greatest job creators are the hedge fund guys.


1167
0:53:58,145 --> 0:53:58,645
[Ryan] (Let's end ?) —


1168
0:53:58,645 --> 0:53:59,145
[Raddatz] And you're going


1169
0:53:59,145 --> 0:53:59,989
— and you're going to increase the defense budget.


1170
0:53:59,989 --> 0:54:0,489
[Ryan] Think about it this way.


1171
0:54:0,489 --> 0:54:2,153
[Raddatz] And you're going to increase the defense budget.


1172
0:54:2,153 --> 0:54:4,87
[Ryan] No, we're just not going to cut the defense budget


1173
0:54:4,87 --> 0:54:4,618
like they're — they're proposing —


1174
0:54:4,618 --> 0:54:6,686
[Biden] They're going to increase it $2 billion — $2 trillion.


1175
0:54:6,686 --> 0:54:8,46
[Ryan] That's not accurate. We're talking about preventing —


1176
0:54:8,46 --> 0:54:11,46
[Raddatz] More than that. No — so no massive defense increase?


1177
0:54:11,46 --> 0:54:11,823
[Ryan] No, we're saying is, don't —


1178
0:54:11,823 --> 0:54:12,646
OK, you want to get into defense now?


1179
0:54:12,646 --> 0:54:14,187
[Raddatz] Let — yes, I do. I do —


1180
0:54:14,187 --> 0:54:15,149
[Ryan] All right. So —


1181
0:54:15,149 --> 0:54:15,741
[Raddatz] — because that's another math question.


1182
0:54:15,741 --> 0:54:16,241
[Ryan] Right. OK.


1183
0:54:16,241 --> 0:54:17,28
[Raddatz] How do you do that?


1184
0:54:17,28 --> 0:54:21,614
[Ryan] So they proposed a $478 (sic) billion cut to defense


1185
0:54:21,614 --> 0:54:22,39
to begin with.


1186
0:54:22,39 --> 0:54:25,759
Now we have another $500 billion cut to defense


1187
0:54:25,759 --> 0:54:27,505
that's lurking on the horizon.


1188
0:54:27,505 --> 0:54:31,383
They insisted upon that cut being involved in the debt negotiations —


1189
0:54:31,383 --> 0:54:32,13
[Raddatz] Let —


1190
0:54:32,13 --> 0:54:33,137
[Ryan] — and now we have a $1 trillion cut —


1191
0:54:33,137 --> 0:54:35,95
[Raddatz] Let's put the automatic defense cuts aside. OK?


1192
0:54:35,95 --> 0:54:35,872
[Ryan] Right. OK.


1193
0:54:35,872 --> 0:54:37,526
[Raddatz] Let's put those aside. No one wants that.


1194
0:54:37,526 --> 0:54:38,41
[Biden] I'd like to go back to that.


1195
0:54:38,41 --> 0:54:38,541
[Ryan] OK.


1196
0:54:38,541 --> 0:54:39,841
[Raddatz] But I want to know how you do the math


1197
0:54:39,841 --> 0:54:41,896
and have this increase in defense spending?


1198
0:54:41,896 --> 0:54:43,18
[Biden] 2 trillion dollars.


1199
0:54:43,18 --> 0:54:45,156
[Ryan] You don't cut defense by a trillion dollars.


1200
0:54:45,156 --> 0:54:46,471
That's what we're talking about. The additional trillion —


1201
0:54:46,471 --> 0:54:49,722
[Raddatz] And what national security issues justify an increase?


1202
0:54:49,722 --> 0:54:50,729
[Biden] Who's cutting it by a trillion?


1203
0:54:50,729 --> 0:54:54,896
[Ryan] We're going to cut 80,000 soldiers, 20,000 Marines,


1204
0:54:54,896 --> 0:54:58,263
120 cargo planes.


1205
0:54:58,263 --> 0:54:59,348
We're going to push the Joint Strike Fighter out.


1206
0:54:59,348 --> 0:55:0,694
[Raddatz] Drawing down in one war —


1207
0:55:0,694 --> 0:55:1,886
[Ryan] We're cutting missile defense.


1208
0:55:1,886 --> 0:55:2,478
[Raddatz] — and one war — (inaudible ) —


1209
0:55:2,478 --> 0:55:5,562
[Ryan] If these cuts go through, our Navy will be the small it is


1210
0:55:5,562 --> 0:55:8,876
— it — the smallest it has been since before World War I.


1211
0:55:8,876 --> 0:55:11,502
This invites weakness.


1212
0:55:11,502 --> 0:55:12,51
Look, do we believe in peace through strength?


1213
0:55:12,51 --> 0:55:13,164
You bet we do.


1214
0:55:13,164 --> 0:55:17,701
And that means you don't impose these devastating cuts on our military.


1215
0:55:17,701 --> 0:55:21,412
So we're saying don't cut the military by a trillion dollars,


1216
0:55:21,412 --> 0:55:24,521
not increase it by a trillion, don't cut it by a trillion dollars.


1217
0:55:24,521 --> 0:55:26,74
[Raddatz] Quickly, Vice President Biden, on this, and I want to move on.


1218
0:55:26,74 --> 0:55:28,24
[Biden] Look, we don't cut it.


1219
0:55:28,24 --> 0:55:29,227
And I might add this so-called


1220
0:55:29,227 --> 0:55:33,179
— I know we don't want to use the fancy word "sequester," this automatic cut —


1221
0:55:33,179 --> 0:55:35,875
that was part of a debt deal that they asked for.


1222
0:55:35,875 --> 0:55:38,705
And let me tell you what my friend said at a press conference


1223
0:55:38,705 --> 0:55:40,574
announcing his support of the deal.


1224
0:55:40,574 --> 0:55:45,115
He said — and I'm — we've been looking for this moment for a long time. (Inaudible) —


1225
0:55:45,115 --> 0:55:47,92
[Ryan] Can I tell you what that meant?


1226
0:55:47,92 --> 0:55:47,592
[Biden] Why —


1227
0:55:47,592 --> 0:55:49,107
[Ryan] We've been looking for bipartisanship for a long time.


1228
0:55:49,107 --> 0:55:51,587
[Biden] And so the bipartisanship is what he voted for:


1229
0:55:51,587 --> 0:55:54,225
the automatic cuts in defense if they didn't act.


1230
0:55:54,225 --> 0:55:56,306
And beyond that, they asked for another —


1231
0:55:56,306 --> 0:56:1,104
look, the military says, we need a smaller, leaner Army.


1232
0:56:1,104 --> 0:56:2,697
We need more special forces.


1233
0:56:2,697 --> 0:56:6,833
We need — we don't need more M1 tanks. What we need is more UAVs.


1234
0:56:6,833 --> 0:56:7,764
[Raddatz] Some of the military — I know that's — (inaudible) —


1235
0:56:7,764 --> 0:56:9,2
[Biden] Not some of the military;


1236
0:56:9,2 --> 0:56:13,281
that was the decision of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,


1237
0:56:13,281 --> 0:56:16,688
recommended to us and agreed to by the president.


1238
0:56:16,688 --> 0:56:17,588
That's a fact.


1239
0:56:17,588 --> 0:56:18,98
[Raddatz] Who answers to the civilian leaders.


1240
0:56:18,98 --> 0:56:20,747
[Biden] They made the recommendation first.


1241
0:56:20,747 --> 0:56:22,741
[Raddatz] OK. Let's move on to Afghanistan.


1242
0:56:22,741 --> 0:56:23,98
[Ryan] Can I get into that for a second?


1243
0:56:23,98 --> 0:56:25,572
[Raddatz] I'd like to move on to Afghanistan, please.


1244
0:56:25,572 --> 0:56:26,72
[Ryan] OK.


1245
0:56:26,72 --> 0:56:29,139
[Raddatz] And that's one of the biggest expenditures this country has made,


1246
0:56:29,139 --> 0:56:32,122
in dollars and, more importantly, in lives.


1247
0:56:32,122 --> 0:56:37,755
We just passed the sad milestone of losing 2,000 U.S. troops there in this war.


1248
0:56:37,755 --> 0:56:40,569
More than 50 of them were killed this year


1249
0:56:40,569 --> 0:56:43,817
by the very Afghan forces we are trying to help.


1250
0:56:43,817 --> 0:56:47,73
Now, we've reached the recruiting goal for Afghan forces.


1251
0:56:47,73 --> 0:56:49,707
We've degraded al-Qaida.


1252
0:56:49,707 --> 0:56:52,235
So tell me, why not leave now?


1253
0:56:52,235 --> 0:56:54,649
What more can we really accomplish?


1254
0:56:54,649 --> 0:56:57,442
Is it worth more American lives?


1255
0:56:57,442 --> 0:56:59,627
[Ryan] We don't want to lose the gains we've gotten.


1256
0:56:59,627 --> 0:57:3,752
We want to make sure that the Taliban does not come back in


1257
0:57:3,752 --> 0:57:5,76
and give al- Qaida a safe haven.


1258
0:57:5,76 --> 0:57:9,137
We agree with the administration on their 2014 transition.


1259
0:57:9,137 --> 0:57:11,413
Look, when I think about Afghanistan,


1260
0:57:11,413 --> 0:57:15,11
I think about the incredible job that our troops have done.


1261
0:57:15,11 --> 0:57:17,295
You've been there more than the 2 of us combined.


1262
0:57:17,295 --> 0:57:19,473
First time I was there in 2002,


1263
0:57:19,473 --> 0:57:21,729
it was amazing to me what they were facing.


1264
0:57:21,729 --> 0:57:26,14
When I went to the Arghandab Valley in Kandahar before the surge,


1265
0:57:26,14 --> 0:57:28,32
I sat down with a young private in the 82nd


1266
0:57:28,32 --> 0:57:29,939
from the Menominee Indian Reservation


1267
0:57:29,939 --> 0:57:33,133
who would tell me what he did every day, and I was in awe.


1268
0:57:33,133 --> 0:57:35,33
And to see what they had in front of them


1269
0:57:35,33 --> 0:57:36,641
— and then to go back there in December,


1270
0:57:36,641 --> 0:57:38,195
to go throughout Helmand with the Marines


1271
0:57:38,195 --> 0:57:39,556
to see what they had accomplished


1272
0:57:39,556 --> 0:57:41,811
— it's nothing short of amazing.


1273
0:57:41,811 --> 0:57:45,867
What we don't want to do is lose the gains we've gotten.


1274
0:57:45,867 --> 0:57:49,123
Now, we've disagreed from time to time on a few issues.


1275
0:57:49,123 --> 0:57:51,437
We would have more likely taken into account


1276
0:57:51,437 --> 0:57:55,765
the recommendations from our commanders, General Petraeus, Admiral Mullen,


1277
0:57:55,765 --> 0:57:59,156
on troop levels throughout this year's fighting season.


1278
0:57:59,156 --> 0:58:1,721
We've been skeptical about negotiations with the Taliban,


1279
0:58:1,721 --> 0:58:3,667
especially while they're shooting at us.


1280
0:58:3,667 --> 0:58:7,928
But we want to see the 2014 transition be successful.


1281
0:58:7,928 --> 0:58:12,399
And that means we want to make sure our commanders have what they need


1282
0:58:12,399 --> 0:58:14,191
to make sure that it is successful


1283
0:58:14,191 --> 0:58:18,14
so that this does not once again become a launching pad for terrorists.


1284
0:58:18,14 --> 0:58:19,508
[Raddatz] Vice President Biden.


1285
0:58:19,508 --> 0:58:21,208
[Biden] Martha, let's keep our eye on the ball.


1286
0:58:21,208 --> 0:58:25,297
The reason I've been in and out of Afghanistan and Iraq 20 times


1287
0:58:25,297 --> 0:58:27,266
— I've been up in the Kunar valley —


1288
0:58:27,266 --> 0:58:30,752
I've been throughout that whole country, mostly in a helicopter


1289
0:58:30,752 --> 0:58:33,698
and sometimes in a vehicle.


1290
0:58:33,698 --> 0:58:36,13
The fact is we went there for one reason:


1291
0:58:36,13 --> 0:58:40,402
to get those people who killed Americans, al-Qaida.


1292
0:58:40,402 --> 0:58:42,718
We've decimated al-Qaida central.


1293
0:58:42,718 --> 0:58:47,663
We have eliminated Osama bin Laden. That was our purpose.


1294
0:58:47,663 --> 0:58:50,642
And in fact, in the meantime, what we said we would do,


1295
0:58:50,642 --> 0:58:54,652
we would help train the Afghan military.


1296
0:58:54,652 --> 0:58:59,83
It's their responsibility to take over their own security.


1297
0:58:59,83 --> 0:59:4,356
That's why, with 49 of our allies in Afghanistan,


1298
0:59:4,356 --> 0:59:10,255
we've agreed on a gradual drawdown so we're out of there by the year twenty -


1299
0:59:10,255 --> 0:59:12,34
— in the year 2014.


1300
0:59:12,34 --> 0:59:15,903
My friend and the governor say it's based on conditions,


1301
0:59:15,903 --> 0:59:17,541
which means it depends.


1302
0:59:17,541 --> 0:59:20,67
It does not depend for us.


1303
0:59:20,67 --> 0:59:25,817
It is the responsibility of the Afghans to take care of their own security.


1304
0:59:25,817 --> 0:59:30,9
We have trained over 315,000, mostly without incident.


1305
0:59:30,9 --> 0:59:34,132
There have been more than 2 dozen cases of green on blue


1306
0:59:34,132 --> 0:59:35,985
where Americans have been killed.


1307
0:59:35,985 --> 0:59:40,892
If we do — if the — if the measures the military has taken do not take hold,


1308
0:59:40,892 --> 0:59:44,359
we will not go on joint patrols, we will not train in the field.


1309
0:59:44,359 --> 0:59:50,765
We'll only train in the — in the Army bases that exist there.


1310
0:59:50,765 --> 0:59:52,388
But we are leaving.


1311
0:59:52,388 --> 0:59:56,886
We are leaving in 2014, period.


1312
0:59:56,886 --> 1:0:0,345
And in the process, we're going to be saving over the next 10 years


1313
1:0:0,345 --> 1:0:2,957
another $800 billion.


1314
1:0:2,957 --> 1:0:5,568
We've been in this war for over a decade.


1315
1:0:5,568 --> 1:0:9,278
The primary objective is almost completed.


1316
1:0:9,278 --> 1:0:13,968
Now all we're doing is putting the Kabul government in a position


1317
1:0:13,968 --> 1:0:16,815
to be able to maintain their own security.


1318
1:0:16,815 --> 1:0:20,52
It's their responsibility, not America's.


1319
1:0:20,52 --> 1:0:24,737
[Raddatz] What conditions could justify staying, Congressman Ryan?


1320
1:0:24,737 --> 1:0:25,73
[Ryan] We don't want to stay.


1321
1:0:25,73 --> 1:0:30,19
We want — look, one of my best friends in Janesville, a reservist,


1322
1:0:30,19 --> 1:0:33,577
is at a forward operating base in Eastern Afghanistan right now.


1323
1:0:33,577 --> 1:0:36,47
Our wives are best friends, our daughters are best friends.


1324
1:0:36,47 --> 1:0:40,359
I want — I want him and all of our troops to come home


1325
1:0:40,359 --> 1:0:42,676
as soon and safely as possible.


1326
1:0:42,676 --> 1:0:45,263
We want to make sure that 2014 is successful.


1327
1:0:45,263 --> 1:0:48,244
That's why we want to make sure that we give our commanders


1328
1:0:48,244 --> 1:0:50,648
what they say they need to make it successful.


1329
1:0:50,648 --> 1:0:53,946
We don't want to extend beyond 2014. That's the point we're making.


1330
1:0:53,946 --> 1:0:58,38
You know, if it was just this, I feel like we would


1331
1:0:58,38 --> 1:1:2,345
— we would be able to call this a success, but it's not.


1332
1:1:2,345 --> 1:1:6,601
What we are witnessing as we turn on our television screens these days,


1333
1:1:6,601 --> 1:1:10,217
is the absolute unraveling of the Obama foreign policy.


1334
1:1:10,217 --> 1:1:13,488
Problems are growing at home, but jobs


1335
1:1:13,488 --> 1:1:14,634
— problems are growing abroad –


1336
1:1:14,634 --> 1:1:17,22
but jobs aren't growing here at home.


1337
1:1:17,22 --> 1:1:17,968
[Raddatz] Let me go back to this.


1338
1:1:17,968 --> 1:1:22,824
He says we're absolutely leaving in 2014.


1339
1:1:22,824 --> 1:1:25,448
You're saying that's not an absolute,


1340
1:1:25,448 --> 1:1:26,71
but you won't talk about what conditions would justify —


1341
1:1:26,71 --> 1:1:27,355
[Ryan] Do you know why we say that?


1342
1:1:27,355 --> 1:1:28,671
Do you know why we say that?


1343
1:1:28,671 --> 1:1:29,709
[Biden] I'd like to know why.


1344
1:1:29,709 --> 1:1:31,532
[Ryan] Because we don't want to broadcast to our enemies,


1345
1:1:31,532 --> 1:1:33,632
put a date on your calendar,


1346
1:1:33,632 --> 1:1:35,532
wait us out and then come back.


1347
1:1:35,532 --> 1:1:36,94
We want to make sure —


1348
1:1:36,94 --> 1:1:37,86
[Raddatz] But you agree with the timeline?


1349
1:1:37,86 --> 1:1:40,801
[Ryan] We do — we do agree with the timeline in the transition,


1350
1:1:40,801 --> 1:1:44,488
but what we — what any administration will do in 2013


1351
1:1:44,488 --> 1:1:49,57
is assess the situation to see how best to complete this timeline.


1352
1:1:49,57 --> 1:1:49,68
What we do not want to do —


1353
1:1:49,68 --> 1:1:51,831
[Biden] We will leave in 2014.


1354
1:1:51,831 --> 1:1:55,483
[Ryan] What we do not want to do is give our allies reason


1355
1:1:55,483 --> 1:1:59,549
to trust us less and our enemies more —


1356
1:1:59,549 --> 1:2:1,295
we don't want to embolden our enemies


1357
1:2:1,295 --> 1:2:3,887
to hold and wait out for us and then take over the —


1358
1:2:3,887 --> 1:2:5,316
[Biden] Martha, that's a bizarre statement.


1359
1:2:5,316 --> 1:2:6,37
[Ryan] That's why we want to make sure


1360
1:2:6,37 --> 1:2:7,332
— no, that's why we want to make sure that this — that —


1361
1:2:7,332 --> 1:2:9,713
[Biden] That's a bizarre statement, since 49 of our allies — hear me,


1362
1:2:9,713 --> 1:2:15,2
49 of our allies signed onto this position, 49.


1363
1:2:15,2 --> 1:2:17,58
[Ryan] And we're reading that they want to pull out early.


1364
1:2:17,58 --> 1:2:21,781
[Biden] 49. 49 of our allies said out in 2014.


1365
1:2:21,781 --> 1:2:24,78
It's the responsibility of the Afghans.


1366
1:2:24,78 --> 1:2:25,147
We have other responsibilities —


1367
1:2:25,147 --> 1:2:25,662
[Ryan] Which is — which is — which is what we agree with.


1368
1:2:25,662 --> 1:2:29,308
[Raddatz] Do you — do you think that this timeline — but we have — we have soldiers and Marines —


1369
1:2:29,308 --> 1:2:30,469
[Biden] (Theirs are sufficient. ?)


1370
1:2:30,469 --> 1:2:34,695
[Raddatz] We have Afghan forces murdering our forces over there.


1371
1:2:34,695 --> 1:2:38,967
The Taliban is, do you think, taking advantage of this timeline?


1372
1:2:38,967 --> 1:2:43,169
[Biden] Well, look, the Taliban — what we've found out —


1373
1:2:43,169 --> 1:2:45,85
and we — you — you saw it in Iraq, Martha.


1374
1:2:45,85 --> 1:2:47,293
Unless you set a timeline,


1375
1:2:47,293 --> 1:2:54,175
Baghdad in the case of Iraq and — and Kabul in the case of Afghanistan


1376
1:2:54,175 --> 1:2:55,429
will not step up.


1377
1:2:55,429 --> 1:2:57,998
They're happy to let us continue to do the job —


1378
1:2:57,998 --> 1:3:0,373
international security forces to do the job.


1379
1:3:0,373 --> 1:3:4,588
The only way they step up is say, fellas, we're leaving;


1380
1:3:4,588 --> 1:3:8,404
we've trained you; step up. Step up.


1381
1:3:8,404 --> 1:3:9,366
[Raddatz] But let me — let me go back —


1382
1:3:9,366 --> 1:3:10,943
[Biden] That's the only way it works.


1383
1:3:10,943 --> 1:3:14,142
[Raddatz] Let me go back to the surge troops that we put in there.


1384
1:3:14,142 --> 1:3:16,973
And you brought this up, Congressman Ryan.


1385
1:3:16,973 --> 1:3:18,704
I have talked to a lot of troops.


1386
1:3:18,704 --> 1:3:21,814
I've talked to senior officers who were concerned


1387
1:3:21,814 --> 1:3:26,188
that the surge troops were pulled out during the fighting season,


1388
1:3:26,188 --> 1:3:30,303
and some of them saw that as a political — as a political move.


1389
1:3:30,303 --> 1:3:32,109
So can you tell me, Vice President Biden,


1390
1:3:32,109 --> 1:3:36,422
what was the military reason for bringing those surge troops home


1391
1:3:36,422 --> 1:3:36,922
before the fighting season ended?


1392
1:3:36,922 --> 1:3:38,43
[Biden] The military reason was bringing


1393
1:3:38,43 --> 1:3:40,503
— by the way, when the president announced the surge —


1394
1:3:40,503 --> 1:3:41,972
you'll remember, Martha —


1395
1:3:41,972 --> 1:3:46,815
he said, the surge will be out by the end of the summer.


1396
1:3:46,815 --> 1:3:49,908
The military said, the surge will be out.


1397
1:3:49,908 --> 1:3:51,316
Nothing political about this.


1398
1:3:51,316 --> 1:3:53,769
Before the surge occurred


1399
1:3:53,769 --> 1:3:55,838
— so you be a little straight with me here, too —


1400
1:3:55,838 --> 1:3:58,624
before the surge occurred, we said,


1401
1:3:58,624 --> 1:4:1,177
they'll be out by the end of the summer.


1402
1:4:1,177 --> 1:4:3,794
That's what the military said. The reason for that is —


1403
1:4:3,794 --> 1:4:5,477
[Raddatz] Military follows orders.


1404
1:4:5,477 --> 1:4:7,432
They — I mean, there — trust me, there are people —


1405
1:4:7,432 --> 1:4:8,55
[Biden] Sure —


1406
1:4:8,55 --> 1:4:9,794
[Raddatz] — who were concerned about pulling out on the fighting season.


1407
1:4:9,794 --> 1:4:11,614
[Biden] But — there are people that were concerned,


1408
1:4:11,614 --> 1:4:12,899
but not the Joint Chiefs.


1409
1:4:12,899 --> 1:4:16,9
That was their recommendation in the Oval Office


1410
1:4:16,9 --> 1:4:18,926
to the president of the United States of America.


1411
1:4:18,926 --> 1:4:20,72
I sat there.


1412
1:4:20,72 --> 1:4:22,995
I'm sure you'll find someone who disagrees with the Pentagon.


1413
1:4:22,995 --> 1:4:27,132
I'm positive you'll find that within the military. But that's not the case here.


1414
1:4:27,132 --> 1:4:30,22
And secondly, the reason why the military said that


1415
1:4:30,22 --> 1:4:34,457
is you cannot wait and have a cliff.


1416
1:4:34,457 --> 1:4:39,852
It takes, you know, months and months and months to draw down forces.


1417
1:4:39,852 --> 1:4:40,491
(Inaudible) — cannot wait —


1418
1:4:40,491 --> 1:4:41,329
[Ryan] Let me bring some


1419
1:4:41,329 --> 1:4:44,368
— let me try and illustrate the issue here, because I think this —


1420
1:4:44,368 --> 1:4:45,668
it can get a little confusing.


1421
1:4:45,668 --> 1:4:49,114
We've all met with General Allen and General Scaparotti in Afghanistan


1422
1:4:49,114 --> 1:4:51,152
to talk about fighting seasons.


1423
1:4:51,152 --> 1:4:52,283
Here's the way it works.


1424
1:4:52,283 --> 1:4:54,321
The mountain passes fill in with snow.


1425
1:4:54,321 --> 1:4:58,555
The Taliban and the terrorists and the Haqqani and the Quetta shura


1426
1:4:58,555 --> 1:5:2,178
come over from Pakistan to fight our men and women.


1427
1:5:2,178 --> 1:5:3,75
When it fills in with snow, they can't do it.


1428
1:5:3,75 --> 1:5:5,219
That's what we call fighting seasons.


1429
1:5:5,219 --> 1:5:7,953
In the warm months fighting gets really high;


1430
1:5:7,953 --> 1:5:9,853
in the winter it goes down.


1431
1:5:9,853 --> 1:5:15,597
And so when Admiral Mullen and General Petraeus came to Congress and said,


1432
1:5:15,597 --> 1:5:19,293
if you pull these people out before the fighting season is end,


1433
1:5:19,293 --> 1:5:22,144
it puts people more at risk — that's the problem.


1434
1:5:22,144 --> 1:5:25,397
Yes, we drew 22,000 troops down last month.


1435
1:5:25,397 --> 1:5:27,833
But the remaining troops that are there,


1436
1:5:27,833 --> 1:5:31,364
who still have the same mission to prosecute, counterinsurgency,


1437
1:5:31,364 --> 1:5:34,208
are doing it with fewer people.


1438
1:5:34,208 --> 1:5:35,139
That makes them less safe.


1439
1:5:35,139 --> 1:5:35,639
[Biden] (Inaudible.)


1440
1:5:35,639 --> 1:5:40,13
[Ryan] We're sending fewer people out in all these hot spots


1441
1:5:40,13 --> 1:5:42,53
to do the same job that they were supposed to do a month ago —


1442
1:5:42,53 --> 1:5:43,769
[Biden] Because we turned it over —


1443
1:5:43,769 --> 1:5:45,365
[Ryan] — but we took 22,000 people out for them to do it.


1444
1:5:45,365 --> 1:5:48,956
[Biden] — we turned it over to the Afghan troops we trained.


1445
1:5:48,956 --> 1:5:55,31
No one got pulled out that didn't get filled in by trained Afghan personnel.


1446
1:5:55,31 --> 1:5:59,207
And he's — he's — he's conflating 2 issues.


1447
1:5:59,207 --> 1:6:2,537
The fighting season that Petraeus was talking about


1448
1:6:2,537 --> 1:6:7,259
and former — and Admiral Mullen was the fighting season this spring.


1449
1:6:7,259 --> 1:6:11,439
That's what he was talking about. We did not — we did not pull them out.


1450
1:6:11,439 --> 1:6:13,693
[Ryan] The calendar works the same every year. (Chuckles.)


1451
1:6:13,693 --> 1:6:15,459
[Biden] It does work the same every year. (Inaudible) — there —


1452
1:6:15,459 --> 1:6:18,405
[Ryan] (Chuckles.) Spring, summer, fall — (chuckles) —


1453
1:6:18,405 --> 1:6:20,259
it's warm or it's not.


1454
1:6:20,259 --> 1:6:23,68
They're still fighting us, they're still coming over the passes,


1455
1:6:23,68 --> 1:6:27,139
they'll — they're still coming in to Zabul or to Kunar,


1456
1:6:27,139 --> 1:6:28,163
to all of these areas,


1457
1:6:28,163 --> 1:6:30,924
but we are sending fewer people to the front to fight them.


1458
1:6:30,924 --> 1:6:31,516
And that is not safe.


1459
1:6:31,516 --> 1:6:34,849
[Biden] That's right, because that's the Afghan responsibility.


1460
1:6:34,849 --> 1:6:35,857
We've trained them.


1461
1:6:35,857 --> 1:6:36,941
[Ryan] Not in the East.


1462
1:6:36,941 --> 1:6:38,801
[Raddatz] Let's move — let's move to another war.


1463
1:6:38,801 --> 1:6:39,901
[Biden] Not in the East? (Inaudible) —


1464
1:6:39,901 --> 1:6:41,168
[Ryan] (Inaudible) — East, RC-East —


1465
1:6:41,168 --> 1:6:42,68
[Biden] RC-East, most dangerous place in the world.


1466
1:6:42,68 --> 1:6:44,903
[Ryan] That's why — that's why we don't want to send fewer people to do the job.


1467
1:6:44,903 --> 1:6:46,601
[Biden] That's — that's why we should send Americans in to do the job


1468
1:6:46,601 --> 1:6:50,298
instead of the — you'd rather Americans be going in and doing the job


1469
1:6:50,298 --> 1:6:50,798
instead of — (inaudible) —


1470
1:6:50,798 --> 1:6:51,806
[Ryan] No. We are already sending Americans to do the job —


1471
1:6:51,806 --> 1:6:52,306
[Biden] No —


1472
1:6:52,306 --> 1:6:53,652
[Ryan] — but fewer of them. That's the whole point.


1473
1:6:53,652 --> 1:6:54,214
[Biden] That — that's right.


1474
1:6:54,214 --> 1:6:59,683
We're sending in more Afghans to do the job, Afghans to do the job.


1475
1:6:59,683 --> 1:7:2,957
[Raddatz] Let's move to another war, the civil war in Syria,


1476
1:7:2,957 --> 1:7:5,611
where there are estimates that — estimates


1477
1:7:5,611 --> 1:7:9,826
that more than 25,000, 30,000 people have now been killed.


1478
1:7:9,826 --> 1:7:13,532
In March of last year, President Obama explained the military action


1479
1:7:13,532 --> 1:7:18,4
taken in Libya by saying it was in the national interest to go in


1480
1:7:18,4 --> 1:7:21,682
and prevent further massacres from occurring there.


1481
1:7:21,682 --> 1:7:25,72
So why doesn't the same logic apply in Syria? Vice President Biden.


1482
1:7:25,72 --> 1:7:28,389
[Biden] It's a different country. It's a different country.


1483
1:7:28,389 --> 1:7:31,716
It is 5 times as large geographically.


1484
1:7:31,716 --> 1:7:35,776
It has 1/5 the population that is Libya,


1485
1:7:35,776 --> 1:7:38,72
1/5 the population, 5 times as large geographically.


1486
1:7:38,72 --> 1:7:41,996
It's in a part of the world where you're not going to see


1487
1:7:41,996 --> 1:7:44,201
whatever would come from that war.


1488
1:7:44,201 --> 1:7:47,317
It'd seep into a regional war.


1489
1:7:47,317 --> 1:7:50,598
You're in a country that is heavily populated


1490
1:7:50,598 --> 1:7:53,63
in the midst of the most dangerous area in the world.


1491
1:7:53,63 --> 1:7:58,63
And in fact, if, in fact, it blows up and the wrong people gain control,


1492
1:7:58,63 --> 1:8:1,57
it's going to have impact on the entire region,


1493
1:8:1,57 --> 1:8:3,865
causing potentially regional wars.


1494
1:8:3,865 --> 1:8:6,822
We are working hand in glove with the Turks,


1495
1:8:6,822 --> 1:8:8,645
with the Jordanians, with the Saudis


1496
1:8:8,645 --> 1:8:11,585
and with all the people in the region


1497
1:8:11,585 --> 1:8:15,275
attempting to identify the people who deserve the help


1498
1:8:15,275 --> 1:8:18,56
so that when Assad goes and he will go,


1499
1:8:18,56 --> 1:8:21,274
there will be a legitimate government that follows on,


1500
1:8:21,274 --> 1:8:24,473
not an al-Qaida-sponsored government that follows on.


1501
1:8:24,473 --> 1:8:28,387
And all this loose talk of my friend, Governor Romney,


1502
1:8:28,387 --> 1:8:30,959
and the congressman about how we're going to do,


1503
1:8:30,959 --> 1:8:32,607
we could do so much more in there,


1504
1:8:32,607 --> 1:8:37,207
what more would they do other than put American boots on the ground?


1505
1:8:37,207 --> 1:8:41,895
The last thing America needs is to get into another ground war


1506
1:8:41,895 --> 1:8:45,191
in the Middle East requiring tens of thousands


1507
1:8:45,191 --> 1:8:48,613
if not well over a hundred thousand American forces.


1508
1:8:48,613 --> 1:8:52,598
That — they are the facts. They are the facts.


1509
1:8:52,598 --> 1:8:55,381
Now, every time the governor is asked about this,


1510
1:8:55,381 --> 1:8:56,466
he doesn't say any — he say —


1511
1:8:56,466 --> 1:9:1,172
he goes up with a whole lot of verbiage,


1512
1:9:1,172 --> 1:9:2,318
but when he gets pressed,


1513
1:9:2,318 --> 1:9:6,693
he says, no, he would not do anything different than we are doing now.


1514
1:9:6,693 --> 1:9:9,28
Are they proposing putting American troops on the ground,


1515
1:9:9,28 --> 1:9:11,781
putting American aircraft in their airspace?


1516
1:9:11,781 --> 1:9:12,65
Is that what they're proposing?


1517
1:9:12,65 --> 1:9:15,11
If they do, they should speak up and say so.


1518
1:9:15,11 --> 1:9:18,163
But that's not what they're saying.


1519
1:9:18,163 --> 1:9:25,354
We are doing it exactly like we need to do to identify those forces


1520
1:9:25,354 --> 1:9:28,176
who, in fact, will provide for a stable government


1521
1:9:28,176 --> 1:9:32,691
and not cause a regional Sunni-Shia war when Bassad (ph)


1522
1:9:32,691 --> 1:9:34,543
— when Bashir Assad falls.


1523
1:9:34,543 --> 1:9:35,997
[Raddatz] Congressman Ryan.


1524
1:9:35,997 --> 1:9:40,813
[Ryan] Nobody is proposing to send troops to Syria — American troops.


1525
1:9:40,813 --> 1:9:42,652
Now let me say it this way.


1526
1:9:42,652 --> 1:9:44,934
How would we do things differently?


1527
1:9:44,934 --> 1:9:48,469
We wouldn't refer Bashar Assad as a reformer


1528
1:9:48,469 --> 1:9:52,92
when he's killing his own civilians with his Russian-provided weapons.


1529
1:9:52,92 --> 1:9:56,639
We wouldn't be outsourcing our foreign policy to the United Nations,


1530
1:9:56,639 --> 1:10:0,816
giving Vladimir Putin veto power over our efforts


1531
1:10:0,816 --> 1:10:2,624
to try and deal with this issue.


1532
1:10:2,624 --> 1:10:4,37
He's vetoed 3 of them.


1533
1:10:4,37 --> 1:10:8,2
Hillary Clinton went to Russia to try and convince him not to do so;


1534
1:10:8,2 --> 1:10:9,736
they thwarted her efforts.


1535
1:10:9,736 --> 1:10:11,36
She said they were on the wrong side of history.


1536
1:10:11,36 --> 1:10:12,182
She was right about that.


1537
1:10:12,182 --> 1:10:15,879
This is just one more example of how the Russia reset's not working.


1538
1:10:15,879 --> 1:10:17,379
And so where are we?


1539
1:10:17,379 --> 1:10:19,391
After international pressure mounted,


1540
1:10:19,391 --> 1:10:22,94
then President Obama said Bashar Assad should go.


1541
1:10:22,94 --> 1:10:23,624
It's been over a year.


1542
1:10:23,624 --> 1:10:27,639
The man has slaughtered tens of thousands of his own people


1543
1:10:27,639 --> 1:10:30,62
and more foreign fighters are spilling into this country.


1544
1:10:30,62 --> 1:10:35,698
So the longer this has gone on, the more people


1545
1:10:35,698 --> 1:10:37,9
— groups like al-Qaida are going in.


1546
1:10:37,9 --> 1:10:41,526
We could have more easily identified the Free Syrian Army,


1547
1:10:41,526 --> 1:10:44,234
the freedom fighters, working with our allies,


1548
1:10:44,234 --> 1:10:46,585
the Turks, the Qataris, the Saudis,


1549
1:10:46,585 --> 1:10:51,642
had we had a better plan in place to begin with, working through our allies.


1550
1:10:51,642 --> 1:10:54,326
But no, we waited for Kofi Annan


1551
1:10:54,326 --> 1:10:57,85
to try and come up with an agreement through the U.N.


1552
1:10:57,85 --> 1:10:59,439
That bought Bashar Assad time.


1553
1:10:59,439 --> 1:11:3,316
We gave Russia veto power over our efforts through the U.N.


1554
1:11:3,316 --> 1:11:7,403
and meanwhile about 30,000 Syrians are dead.


1555
1:11:7,403 --> 1:11:10,645
[Biden] What would my friend do differently?


1556
1:11:10,645 --> 1:11:12,525
If you notice, he never answers the question.


1557
1:11:12,525 --> 1:11:14,435
[Ryan] No, I would — I — we would not be going through the U.N.


1558
1:11:14,435 --> 1:11:15,397
on all of these things —


1559
1:11:15,397 --> 1:11:18,47
[Biden] Let — let — let me — you don't go through the U.N.


1560
1:11:18,47 --> 1:11:22,234
We are in the process now and have been for months


1561
1:11:22,234 --> 1:11:25,491
in making sure that help, humanitarian aid,


1562
1:11:25,491 --> 1:11:27,685
as well as other aid and training,


1563
1:11:27,685 --> 1:11:31,156
is getting to those forces that we believe,


1564
1:11:31,156 --> 1:11:35,103
the Turks believe, the Jordanians believe, the Saudis believe


1565
1:11:35,103 --> 1:11:38,289
are the free forces inside of Syria.


1566
1:11:38,289 --> 1:11:39,897
That is under way.


1567
1:11:39,897 --> 1:11:46,28
Our allies were all on the same page, NATO as well as our Arab allies,


1568
1:11:46,28 --> 1:11:49,601
in terms of trying to get a settlement.


1569
1:11:49,601 --> 1:11:52,855
That was their idea. We're the ones that said, enough.


1570
1:11:52,855 --> 1:11:55,737
With regard to the reset not working,


1571
1:11:55,737 --> 1:11:58,731
the fact of the matter is that Russia has a different interest in Syria


1572
1:11:58,731 --> 1:12:1,595
than we do, and that's not in our interest.


1573
1:12:1,595 --> 1:12:4,527
[Raddatz] What happens if Assad does not fall?


1574
1:12:4,527 --> 1:12:7,249
Congressman Ryan, what happens to the region?


1575
1:12:7,249 --> 1:12:9,951
What happens if he hangs on? What happens if he does?


1576
1:12:9,951 --> 1:12:14,14
[Ryan] Then Iran keeps their greatest ally in the region.


1577
1:12:14,14 --> 1:12:15,792
He's a sponsor of terrorism.


1578
1:12:15,792 --> 1:12:18,431
He'll probably continue slaughtering his people.


1579
1:12:18,431 --> 1:12:21,641
We and the world community will lose our credibility on this.


1580
1:12:21,641 --> 1:12:23,296
Look, he mentioned the reset.


1581
1:12:23,296 --> 1:12:25,119
[Raddatz] So what would Romney-Ryan do about that credibility?


1582
1:12:25,119 --> 1:12:27,768
[Ryan] Well, we agree with the same red line, actually,


1583
1:12:27,768 --> 1:12:31,344
they do on chemical weapons, but not putting American troops in,


1584
1:12:31,344 --> 1:12:32,69
other than to secure those chemical weapons.


1585
1:12:32,69 --> 1:12:35,288
They're right about that.


1586
1:12:35,288 --> 1:12:39,468
But what we should have done earlier is work with those freedom fighters,


1587
1:12:39,468 --> 1:12:41,264
those dissidents in Syria.


1588
1:12:41,264 --> 1:12:45,418
We should not have called Bashar Assad a reformer,


1589
1:12:45,418 --> 1:12:46,548
and we should not have


1590
1:12:46,548 --> 1:12:49,859
— we should not have waited to Russia to give us the green light —


1591
1:12:49,859 --> 1:12:50,774
[Biden] We didn't call Assad —


1592
1:12:50,774 --> 1:12:51,396
[Raddatz] What's your criteria for —


1593
1:12:51,396 --> 1:12:54,398
[Ryan] We should not have waited for Russia


1594
1:12:54,398 --> 1:12:55,143
to give us the green light at the U.N. to do something about it.


1595
1:12:55,143 --> 1:12:55,966
[Biden] Russia —


1596
1:12:55,966 --> 1:12:58,267
[Ryan] They're — they're still arming the man.


1597
1:12:58,267 --> 1:12:59,907
Iran is flying flights over Iraq —


1598
1:12:59,907 --> 1:13:2,454
[Biden] And the opposition is being armed —


1599
1:13:2,454 --> 1:13:5,46
[Ryan] — to help — to help — to help Bashar Assad.


1600
1:13:5,46 --> 1:13:6,289
And by the way, if we had the status of forces agreement


1601
1:13:6,289 --> 1:13:9,891
that the vice president said he would bet his vice presidency on in Iraq,


1602
1:13:9,891 --> 1:13:12,327
we probably would have been able to prevent that.


1603
1:13:12,327 --> 1:13:15,28
But he failed to achieve that as well. Again —


1604
1:13:15,28 --> 1:13:16,481
[Raddatz] Let me ask you quickly,


1605
1:13:16,481 --> 1:13:18,794
what's your criteria for intervention?


1606
1:13:18,794 --> 1:13:19,555
[Biden] I don't — yeah.


1607
1:13:19,555 --> 1:13:20,624
[Ryan] In Syria?


1608
1:13:20,624 --> 1:13:22,2
[Raddatz] Worldwide.


1609
1:13:22,2 --> 1:13:23,607
[Ryan] What is in the national interests of the American people.


1610
1:13:23,607 --> 1:13:25,26
[Raddatz] How about humanitarian interests?


1611
1:13:25,26 --> 1:13:27,83
[Ryan] What is in the national security of the American people


1612
1:13:27,83 --> 1:13:29,395
— it's got to be in the strategic national interests of our country.


1613
1:13:29,395 --> 1:13:31,938
[Raddatz] No humanitarian?


1614
1:13:31,938 --> 1:13:35,87
[Ryan] Each situation will — will come up with its own set of circumstances.


1615
1:13:35,87 --> 1:13:37,647
But putting American troops on the ground,


1616
1:13:37,647 --> 1:13:42,592
that's got to be within the national security interests of the American people.


1617
1:13:42,592 --> 1:13:45,65
[Raddatz] I want to — we're almost out of time here.


1618
1:13:45,65 --> 1:13:47,36
[Ryan] That means things like embargoes and sanctions and overflights


1619
1:13:47,36 --> 1:13:51,52
— those are things that don't put American troops on the ground.


1620
1:13:51,52 --> 1:13:53,336
But if you're talking about putting American troops on the ground,


1621
1:13:53,336 --> 1:13:56,308
only in our national security interests.


1622
1:13:56,308 --> 1:13:58,208
[Raddatz] I want to move on,


1623
1:13:58,208 --> 1:14:0,521
and I want to return home for these last few questions.


1624
1:14:0,521 --> 1:14:2,28
This debate is indeed historic.


1625
1:14:2,28 --> 1:14:8,544
We have 2 Catholic candidates, first time on a stage such as this,


1626
1:14:8,544 --> 1:14:10,615
and I would like to ask you both to tell me


1627
1:14:10,615 --> 1:14:17,27
what role your religion has played in your own personal views on abortion.


1628
1:14:17,27 --> 1:14:21,509
Please talk about how you came to that decision.


1629
1:14:21,509 --> 1:14:25,369
Talk about how your religion played a part in that.


1630
1:14:25,369 --> 1:14:28,694
And please, this is such an emotional issue for so many —


1631
1:14:28,694 --> 1:14:29,64
[Ryan] Sure.


1632
1:14:29,64 --> 1:14:31,386
[Raddatz] — people in this country.


1633
1:14:31,386 --> 1:14:37,876
Please talk personally about this if you could. Congressman Ryan.


1634
1:14:37,876 --> 1:14:40,908
[Ryan] I don't see how a person can separate their public life


1635
1:14:40,908 --> 1:14:44,103
from their private life or from their faith.


1636
1:14:44,103 --> 1:14:46,396
Our faith informs us in everything we do.


1637
1:14:46,396 --> 1:14:50,255
My faith informs me about how to take care of the vulnerable,


1638
1:14:50,255 --> 1:14:54,277
about how to make sure that people have a chance in life.


1639
1:14:54,277 --> 1:14:58,473
Now, you want to ask basically why I'm pro-life?


1640
1:14:58,473 --> 1:15:1,342
It's not simply because of my Catholic faith.


1641
1:15:1,342 --> 1:15:7,228
That's a factor, of course, but it's also because of reason and science.


1642
1:15:7,228 --> 1:15:11,482
You know, I think about 10 1/2 years ago,


1643
1:15:11,482 --> 1:15:16,493
my wife Janna and I went to Mercy Hospital in Janesville where I was born


1644
1:15:16,493 --> 1:15:20,247
for our 7-week ultrasound for our firstborn child,


1645
1:15:20,247 --> 1:15:23,202
and we saw that heartbeat.


1646
1:15:23,202 --> 1:15:27,93
Our little baby was in the shape of a bean, and to this day,


1647
1:15:27,93 --> 1:15:33,303
we have nicknamed our firstborn child, Liza, "Bean." (Chuckles.)


1648
1:15:33,303 --> 1:15:36,459
Now, I believe that life begins at conception.


1649
1:15:36,459 --> 1:15:40,522
That's why — those are the reasons why I'm pro-life.


1650
1:15:40,522 --> 1:15:42,56
Now, I understand this is a difficult issue.


1651
1:15:42,56 --> 1:15:45,954
And I respect people who don't agree with me on this.


1652
1:15:45,954 --> 1:15:50,319
But the policy of a Romney administration will be to oppose abortion


1653
1:15:50,319 --> 1:15:55,645
with the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.


1654
1:15:55,645 --> 1:15:59,823
What troubles me more is how this administration has handled


1655
1:15:59,823 --> 1:16:1,54
all of these issues.


1656
1:16:1,54 --> 1:16:4,368
Look at what they're doing through "Obamacare"


1657
1:16:4,368 --> 1:16:8,308
with respect to assaulting the religious liberties of this country.


1658
1:16:8,308 --> 1:16:13,861
They're infringing upon our first freedom, the freedom of religion,


1659
1:16:13,861 --> 1:16:15,936
by infringing on Catholic charities,


1660
1:16:15,936 --> 1:16:19,58
Catholic churches, Catholic hospitals.


1661
1:16:19,58 --> 1:16:21,273
Our church should not have to sue our federal government


1662
1:16:21,273 --> 1:16:22,929
to maintain their religious — religious liberties.


1663
1:16:22,929 --> 1:16:25,401
And with respect to abortion,


1664
1:16:25,401 --> 1:16:29,12
the Democratic Party used to say they want it to be safe, legal and rare.


1665
1:16:29,12 --> 1:16:33,314
Now they support it without restriction and with taxpayer funding,


1666
1:16:33,314 --> 1:16:36,827
taxpayer funding in "Obamacare," taxpayer funding with foreign aid.


1667
1:16:36,827 --> 1:16:38,984
The vice-president himself went to China


1668
1:16:38,984 --> 1:16:42,926
and said that he sympathized or wouldn't second-guess


1669
1:16:42,926 --> 1:16:46,812
their 1-child policy of forced abortions and sterilizations.


1670
1:16:46,812 --> 1:16:49,378
That, to me, is pretty extreme.


1671
1:16:49,378 --> 1:16:52,289
[Raddatz] Vice President Biden.


1672
1:16:52,289 --> 1:16:56,229
[Biden] My religion defines who I am.


1673
1:16:56,229 --> 1:17:2,105
And I've been a practicing Catholic my whole life.


1674
1:17:2,105 --> 1:17:5,785
And it has particularly informed my social doctrine.


1675
1:17:5,785 --> 1:17:9,6
Catholic social doctrine talks about taking care of those who


1676
1:17:9,6 --> 1:17:15,27
— who can't take care of themselves, people who need help.


1677
1:17:15,27 --> 1:17:17,287
With regard to


1678
1:17:17,287 --> 1:17:23,957
— with regard to abortion, I accept my church's position on abortion as a


1679
1:17:23,957 --> 1:17:26,465
— what we call de fide doctrine.


1680
1:17:26,465 --> 1:17:28,782
Life begins at conception. That's the church's judgment.


1681
1:17:28,782 --> 1:17:31,846
I accept it in my personal life.


1682
1:17:31,846 --> 1:17:36,833
But I refuse to impose it on equally devout Christians and Muslims and Jews


1683
1:17:36,833 --> 1:17:39,98
and — I just refuse to impose that on others,


1684
1:17:39,98 --> 1:17:43,763
unlike my friend here, the congressman.


1685
1:17:43,763 --> 1:17:50,322
I — I do not believe that — that we have a right to tell other people


1686
1:17:50,322 --> 1:17:53,92
that women, they — they can't control their body.


1687
1:17:53,92 --> 1:17:56,864
It's a decision between them and their doctor, in my view.


1688
1:17:56,864 --> 1:17:59,876
And the Supreme Court — I'm not going to interfere with that.


1689
1:17:59,876 --> 1:18:3,396
With regard to the assault on the Catholic Church,


1690
1:18:3,396 --> 1:18:6,3
let me make it absolutely clear.


1691
1:18:6,3 --> 1:18:8,771
No religious institution, Catholic or otherwise,


1692
1:18:8,771 --> 1:18:11,672
including Catholic Social Services, Georgetown Hospital,


1693
1:18:11,672 --> 1:18:17,386
Mercy — any hospital — none has to either refer contraception.


1694
1:18:17,386 --> 1:18:20,264
None has to pay for contraception.


1695
1:18:20,264 --> 1:18:24,188
None has to be a vehicle to get contraception


1696
1:18:24,188 --> 1:18:26,422
in any insurance policy they provide.


1697
1:18:26,422 --> 1:18:29,575
That is a fact. That is a fact.


1698
1:18:29,575 --> 1:18:34,767
Now, with regard to the way in which the — we differ,


1699
1:18:34,767 --> 1:18:40,68
my friend says that he —


1700
1:18:40,68 --> 1:18:42,504
well, I guess he accepts Governor Romney's position now,


1701
1:18:42,504 --> 1:18:47,328
because in the past he has argued that there was


1702
1:18:47,328 --> 1:18:49,84
— there's rape and forcible rape.


1703
1:18:49,84 --> 1:18:52,21
He's argued that, in the case of rape or incest,


1704
1:18:52,21 --> 1:18:56,234
it was still — it would be a crime to engage in having an abortion.


1705
1:18:56,234 --> 1:19:0,288
I just fundamentally disagree with my friend.


1706
1:19:0,288 --> 1:19:1,541
[Raddatz] Congressman Ryan.


1707
1:19:1,541 --> 1:19:5,592
[Ryan] All I'm saying is if you believe that life begins at conception,


1708
1:19:5,592 --> 1:19:8,5
that therefore doesn't change the definition of life.


1709
1:19:8,5 --> 1:19:10,121
That's a principle.


1710
1:19:10,121 --> 1:19:12,96
The policy of a Romney administration is to oppose abortion


1711
1:19:12,96 --> 1:19:17,804
with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.


1712
1:19:17,804 --> 1:19:22,236
Now, I've got to take issue with the Catholic Church and religious liberty.


1713
1:19:22,236 --> 1:19:26,5
[Biden] You have, on the issue of Catholic social doctrine, taken issue.


1714
1:19:26,5 --> 1:19:28,261
[Ryan] If they — if they agree with you, then why would they keep —


1715
1:19:28,261 --> 1:19:30,398
why would they keep suing you?


1716
1:19:30,398 --> 1:19:32,18
It's a distinction without a difference.


1717
1:19:32,18 --> 1:19:34,402
[Raddatz] I want to go back to the abortion question here.


1718
1:19:34,402 --> 1:19:36,275
If the Romney-Ryan ticket is elected,


1719
1:19:36,275 --> 1:19:41,85
should those who believe that abortion should remain legal be worried?


1720
1:19:41,85 --> 1:19:45,128
[Ryan] We don't think that unelected judges should make this decision;


1721
1:19:45,128 --> 1:19:48,628
that people, through their elected representatives


1722
1:19:48,628 --> 1:19:51,356
and reaching a consensus in society through the democratic process,


1723
1:19:51,356 --> 1:19:53,876
should make this determination.


1724
1:19:53,876 --> 1:19:55,237
[Biden] The court


1725
1:19:55,237 --> 1:19:58,982
— the next president will get 1 or 2 Supreme Court nominees.


1726
1:19:58,982 --> 1:20:3,93
That's how close Roe v. Wade is.


1727
1:20:3,93 --> 1:20:5,503
Just ask yourself:


1728
1:20:5,503 --> 1:20:12,23
With Robert Bork being the chief adviser on the court for — for Mr. Romney,


1729
1:20:12,23 --> 1:20:14,401
who do you think he's likely to appoint?


1730
1:20:14,401 --> 1:20:18,287
Do you think he's likely to appoint someone like Scalia


1731
1:20:18,287 --> 1:20:22,89
or someone else on the court, far right, that would outlaw Planned


1732
1:20:22,89 --> 1:20:25,95
— excuse me — outlaw abortion?


1733
1:20:25,95 --> 1:20:27,288
I suspect that would happen.


1734
1:20:27,288 --> 1:20:29,682
I guarantee you that will not happen.


1735
1:20:29,682 --> 1:20:32,429
We picked 2 people. We picked people who are open-minded.


1736
1:20:32,429 --> 1:20:34,375
They've been good justices.


1737
1:20:34,375 --> 1:20:36,305
So keep an eye on the Supreme Court —


1738
1:20:36,305 --> 1:20:37,806
[Ryan] Was there a litmus test on them?


1739
1:20:37,806 --> 1:20:39,796
[Biden] There was no litmus test.


1740
1:20:39,796 --> 1:20:43,206
We picked people who had an open mind, did not come with an agenda.


1741
1:20:43,206 --> 1:20:45,804
[Raddatz] I'm going to move on to this closing question


1742
1:20:45,804 --> 1:20:47,92
because we are running out of time.


1743
1:20:47,92 --> 1:20:50,343
It's certainly known — you've said it here tonight —


1744
1:20:50,343 --> 1:20:53,642
that the 2 of you respect our troops enormously.


1745
1:20:53,642 --> 1:20:56,703
Your son has served, and perhaps someday


1746
1:20:56,703 --> 1:20:58,953
your children will serve as well.


1747
1:20:58,953 --> 1:21:2,117
I recently spoke to a highly decorated soldier


1748
1:21:2,117 --> 1:21:6,89
who said that this presidential campaign has left him dismayed.


1749
1:21:6,89 --> 1:21:7,468
He told me, quote,


1750
1:21:7,468 --> 1:21:11,182
"The ads are so negative and they are all tearing down each other,


1751
1:21:11,182 --> 1:21:12,914
rather than building up the country."


1752
1:21:12,914 --> 1:21:16,524
What would you say to that American hero about this campaign?


1753
1:21:16,524 --> 1:21:22,835
And at the end of the day, are you ever embarrassed by the tone?


1754
1:21:22,835 --> 1:21:25,784
Vice President Biden.


1755
1:21:25,784 --> 1:21:29,136
[Biden] I would say to him the same thing I say to my son,


1756
1:21:29,136 --> 1:21:31,121
who did serve year in Iraq:


1757
1:21:31,121 --> 1:21:37,101
that we only have one truly sacred obligation as a government.


1758
1:21:37,101 --> 1:21:39,414
That's to equip those we send into harm's way


1759
1:21:39,414 --> 1:21:42,864
and care for those who come home.


1760
1:21:42,864 --> 1:21:44,9
That's the only sacred obligation we have.


1761
1:21:44,9 --> 1:21:47,914
Everything else falls behind that.


1762
1:21:47,914 --> 1:21:53,759
I would also tell him that the fact that he,


1763
1:21:53,759 --> 1:21:57,464
this decorated soldier you talked about,


1764
1:21:57,464 --> 1:22:1,59
fought for his country — that that should be honored.


1765
1:22:1,59 --> 1:22:3,665
He should not be thrown into a category


1766
1:22:3,665 --> 1:22:8,305
of the 47% who don't pay their taxes while he was out there fighting


1767
1:22:8,305 --> 1:22:12,354
and not having to pay taxes and somehow not taking responsibility.


1768
1:22:12,354 --> 1:22:15,668
I would also tell him that there are things


1769
1:22:15,668 --> 1:22:18,614
that have occurred in this campaign and occur in every campaign


1770
1:22:18,614 --> 1:22:22,54
that I'm sure both of us regret anyone having said,


1771
1:22:22,54 --> 1:22:27,331
particularly in these special new groups that can go out there,


1772
1:22:27,331 --> 1:22:30,141
raise all the money they want, not have to identify themselves


1773
1:22:30,141 --> 1:22:34,124
and say the most scurrilous things about the other candidate.


1774
1:22:34,124 --> 1:22:36,228
It's — it's — it's an abomination.


1775
1:22:36,228 --> 1:22:37,466
But the bottom line here is


1776
1:22:37,466 --> 1:22:41,373
I'd ask that hero you reference to take a look


1777
1:22:41,373 --> 1:22:48,371
at whether or not Governor Romney or President Obama has the conviction


1778
1:22:48,371 --> 1:22:51,458
to help lift up the middle class,


1779
1:22:51,458 --> 1:22:54,401
restore them to where they were before this Great Recession hit


1780
1:22:54,401 --> 1:22:55,595
and they got wiped out


1781
1:22:55,595 --> 1:22:58,703
or whether or not he's going to continue to focus


1782
1:22:58,703 --> 1:23:1,72
on taking care of only the very wealthy,


1783
1:23:1,72 --> 1:23:4,88
not asking them to make — pay any part of the deal


1784
1:23:4,88 --> 1:23:7,832
to bring the — bring back the middle class, the economy of this country.


1785
1:23:7,832 --> 1:23:10,219
I would ask him to take a look at


1786
1:23:10,219 --> 1:23:12,898
whether the president of the United States has acted wisely


1787
1:23:12,898 --> 1:23:15,37
in the use of force


1788
1:23:15,37 --> 1:23:18,263
and whether or not the slipshod comments being made


1789
1:23:18,263 --> 1:23:20,577
by my — my friend or by Governor Romney


1790
1:23:20,577 --> 1:23:24,915
serve — serve our interests very well.


1791
1:23:24,915 --> 1:23:28,275
But there are things that have been said in campaigns


1792
1:23:28,275 --> 1:23:32,165
that I — I find not very appealing.


1793
1:23:32,165 --> 1:23:33,33
[Raddatz] Congressman Ryan.


1794
1:23:33,33 --> 1:23:35,655
[Ryan] First of all, I'd thank him to his service to our country.


1795
1:23:35,655 --> 1:23:37,37
Second of all, I'd say,


1796
1:23:37,37 --> 1:23:39,362
we are not going to impose these devastating cuts on our military


1797
1:23:39,362 --> 1:23:42,99
which compromises their mission and their safety.


1798
1:23:42,99 --> 1:23:43,49
And then I would say,


1799
1:23:43,49 --> 1:23:47,157
you have a president who ran for president 4 years ago


1800
1:23:47,157 --> 1:23:49,15
promising hope and change


1801
1:23:49,15 --> 1:23:53,969
who has now turned his campaign into attack, blame and defame.


1802
1:23:53,969 --> 1:23:57,951
You see, if you don't have a good record to run on,


1803
1:23:57,951 --> 1:24:1,552
then you paint your opponent as someone to run from.


1804
1:24:1,552 --> 1:24:4,249
That was what President Obama said in 2008.


1805
1:24:4,249 --> 1:24:6,76
It's what he's doing right now.


1806
1:24:6,76 --> 1:24:9,285
Look at all the string of broken promises.


1807
1:24:9,285 --> 1:24:11,32
If you like your health care plan you can keep it


1808
1:24:11,32 --> 1:24:13,54
— try telling that to the 20 million people


1809
1:24:13,54 --> 1:24:15,93
who are projected to lose their health insurance


1810
1:24:15,93 --> 1:24:17,26
if "Obamacare" goes through


1811
1:24:17,26 --> 1:24:20,19
or the 7 point million — 7.4 million seniors who are going to lose it.


1812
1:24:20,19 --> 1:24:22,425
Or remember when he said this:


1813
1:24:22,425 --> 1:24:26,302
I guarantee if you make less than $250,000, your taxes won't go up.


1814
1:24:26,302 --> 1:24:30,897
Of the 21 tax increases in "Obamacare," 12 of them hit the middle class.


1815
1:24:30,897 --> 1:24:33,81
Or remember when he said, health insurance premiums will go down,


1816
1:24:33,81 --> 1:24:36,477
and $2,500 per family per year?


1817
1:24:36,477 --> 1:24:37,9
They've gone up 3,000 (dollars),


1818
1:24:37,9 --> 1:24:39,539
and they're expected to go up another 2,400 (dollars).


1819
1:24:39,539 --> 1:24:42,925
Or remember when he said, I promise by the end of my first term,


1820
1:24:42,925 --> 1:24:45,788
I'll cut the deficit in half in 4 years?


1821
1:24:45,788 --> 1:24:50,303
We've had 4 budgets, 4 trillion-dollar deficits.


1822
1:24:50,303 --> 1:24:52,746
A debt crisis is coming.


1823
1:24:52,746 --> 1:24:55,536
We can't keep spending and borrowing like this.


1824
1:24:55,536 --> 1:24:58,462
We can't just keep spending money we don't have.


1825
1:24:58,462 --> 1:25:1,728
Leaders run to problems to fix problems.


1826
1:25:1,728 --> 1:25:8,882
President Obama has not even put a credible plan on the table in any — any of his four years to deal with this debt crisis.


1827
1:25:8,882 --> 1:25:10,277
I passed 2 budgets to deal with this.


1828
1:25:10,277 --> 1:25:12,766
Mitt Romney has put 5 ideas on the table.


1829
1:25:12,766 --> 1:25:15,916
We've got to tackle this debt crisis before it tackles us.


1830
1:25:15,916 --> 1:25:19,169
The president likes to say he has a plan. He gave a speech.


1831
1:25:19,169 --> 1:25:21,67
We asked his budget office, can we see the plan?


1832
1:25:21,67 --> 1:25:23,381
They sent us to this press secretary.


1833
1:25:23,381 --> 1:25:25,488
He gave us a copy of the speech.


1834
1:25:25,488 --> 1:25:26,849
We asked the Congressional Budget Office,


1835
1:25:26,849 --> 1:25:28,894
tell us what President Obama's plan is to prevent a debt crisis.


1836
1:25:28,894 --> 1:25:31,667
They said, it's a speech; we can't estimate speeches.


1837
1:25:31,667 --> 1:25:36,275
You see? That's what we get in this administration: speeches.


1838
1:25:36,275 --> 1:25:37,72
But we're not getting leadership.


1839
1:25:37,72 --> 1:25:42,28
Mitt Romney is uniquely qualified to fix these problems.


1840
1:25:42,28 --> 1:25:46,831
His lifetime of experience, his proven track record of bipartisanship —


1841
1:25:46,831 --> 1:25:48,134
and what do we have from the president?


1842
1:25:48,134 --> 1:25:50,792
He broke his big promise to bring people together


1843
1:25:50,792 --> 1:25:52,364
to solve the country's biggest problems.


1844
1:25:52,364 --> 1:25:55,62
And what I would tell him is we don't have to settle for this.


1845
1:25:55,62 --> 1:25:56,297
[Raddatz] I — I —


1846
1:25:56,297 --> 1:25:57,66
[Ryan] We can do better than this.


1847
1:25:57,66 --> 1:25:59,252
[Biden] I hope I'll get equal time.


1848
1:25:59,252 --> 1:26:2,448
[Raddatz] I — you will get just a few minutes here, a few seconds, really.


1849
1:26:2,448 --> 1:26:7,451
[Biden] The 2 budgets the congressman introduced have eviscerated


1850
1:26:7,451 --> 1:26:10,881
all the things that the middle class cares about.


1851
1:26:10,881 --> 1:26:14,405
It has knocked 19 — it will knock 19 million people off of Medicare.


1852
1:26:14,405 --> 1:26:18,321
It will kick 200,000 children off of early education.


1853
1:26:18,321 --> 1:26:20,663
It will eliminate the tax credit people have


1854
1:26:20,663 --> 1:26:23,409
to be able to send their children to college.


1855
1:26:23,409 --> 1:26:27,622
It cuts education by $450 billion.


1856
1:26:27,622 --> 1:26:30,556
It — it — it does — it does virtually nothing,


1857
1:26:30,556 --> 1:26:35,275
except continue to increase the tax cuts for the very wealthy.


1858
1:26:35,275 --> 1:26:37,926
And, you know, we've had enough of this.


1859
1:26:37,926 --> 1:26:41,39
My — the idea that these — so concerned about these deficits,


1860
1:26:41,39 --> 1:26:45,144
I pointed out, he voted to put 2 wars on a credit card. He did —


1861
1:26:45,144 --> 1:26:47,13
[Raddatz] We're — we're going - We're going to the closing statements in a minute.


1862
1:26:47,13 --> 1:26:48,76
[Ryan] But let me — just a second —


1863
1:26:48,76 --> 1:26:50,956
[Raddatz] I — you're going to have your closing —


1864
1:26:50,956 --> 1:26:54,286
[Ryan] Not raising taxes is not cutting taxes. And by the way, our budget —


1865
1:26:54,286 --> 1:26:55,355
[Biden] We have not raised —


1866
1:26:55,355 --> 1:26:56,947
[Ryan] — we increased spending by 3% a year


1867
1:26:56,947 --> 1:26:59,134
instead of 4.5 % like they proposed.


1868
1:26:59,134 --> 1:27:3,133
[Raddatz] Let me — let me calm down things here just for a minute.


1869
1:27:3,133 --> 1:27:5,17
[Ryan] So not spending more money as much as they say is not a spending cut.


1870
1:27:5,17 --> 1:27:7,427
[Raddatz]  And I want to talk to you very briefly


1871
1:27:7,427 --> 1:27:8,834
before we go to closing statements about your own personal character.


1872
1:27:8,834 --> 1:27:13,189
If you are elected, what could you both give to this country as a man,


1873
1:27:13,189 --> 1:27:17,2
as a human being that no one else could?


1874
1:27:17,2 --> 1:27:19,565
[Ryan] Honesty. No one else could?


1875
1:27:19,565 --> 1:27:22,316
There are plenty of fine people who could lead this country.


1876
1:27:22,316 --> 1:27:24,631
But what you need are people who,


1877
1:27:24,631 --> 1:27:27,418
when they say they're going to do something, they go do it.


1878
1:27:27,418 --> 1:27:31,217
What you need are when people see problems,


1879
1:27:31,217 --> 1:27:33,717
they offer solutions to fix those problems.


1880
1:27:33,717 --> 1:27:35,155
We're not getting that.


1881
1:27:35,155 --> 1:27:37,161
Look, we can grow this economy faster.


1882
1:27:37,161 --> 1:27:39,406
That's what our 5-Point plan for a stronger middle class is all about.


1883
1:27:39,406 --> 1:27:41,472
It's about getting 12 million jobs,


1884
1:27:41,472 --> 1:27:43,202
higher take-home pay;


1885
1:27:43,202 --> 1:27:45,245
getting people out of poverty, into the middle class.


1886
1:27:45,245 --> 1:27:48,454
That means going with proven pro-growth policies that we know work


1887
1:27:48,454 --> 1:27:51,148
to get people back to work, putting ideas on the table,


1888
1:27:51,148 --> 1:27:54,666
working with Democrats — that actually works sometimes —


1889
1:27:54,666 --> 1:27:55,935
and then getting things done.


1890
1:27:55,935 --> 1:27:57,604
[Raddatz] Vice President, could we get to that


1891
1:27:57,604 --> 1:28:0,41
— to that issue of what you could bring as a man, a human being?


1892
1:28:0,41 --> 1:28:2,666
And I really am going to keep you to about 15 seconds here.


1893
1:28:2,666 --> 1:28:5,638
[Biden] Well, he gets 40, I get 15, but that's OK. That's all right.


1894
1:28:5,638 --> 1:28:7,261
[Raddatz] He didn't have 40. He didn't have 40.


1895
1:28:7,261 --> 1:28:10,592
[Biden] Now, let me tell you, I — my — my record stands for itself.


1896
1:28:10,592 --> 1:28:12,751
I never say anything I don't mean.


1897
1:28:12,751 --> 1:28:15,903
Everybody knows whatever I say, I do.


1898
1:28:15,903 --> 1:28:19,644
And my whole life has been devoted to leveling the playing field


1899
1:28:19,644 --> 1:28:22,303
for middle-class people, giving them an even break,


1900
1:28:22,303 --> 1:28:24,654
treating Main Street and Wall Street the same,


1901
1:28:24,654 --> 1:28:26,661
holding the same responsibility.


1902
1:28:26,661 --> 1:28:28,268
Look at my record.


1903
1:28:28,268 --> 1:28:30,516
It's been all about the middle class.


1904
1:28:30,516 --> 1:28:32,123
They're the people who grow this country.


1905
1:28:32,123 --> 1:28:34,183
We think you grow this country from the middle out,


1906
1:28:34,183 --> 1:28:36,273
not from the top down.


1907
1:28:36,273 --> 1:28:39,894
[Raddatz] OK. We now turn to the candidates for their closing statements.


1908
1:28:39,894 --> 1:28:41,301
Thank you, gentlemen.


1909
1:28:41,301 --> 1:28:42,985
And that coin toss, again,


1910
1:28:42,985 --> 1:28:45,274
has Vice President Biden starting with a closing statement.


1911
1:28:45,274 --> 1:28:47,369
[Biden] Well, let — let — let me say at the outset


1912
1:28:47,369 --> 1:28:51,749
that I want to thank you, Martha, for doing this, and Centre College.


1913
1:28:51,749 --> 1:28:55,544
The fact is that we're in a situation


1914
1:28:55,544 --> 1:29:0,816
where we inherited a god-awful circumstance.


1915
1:29:0,816 --> 1:29:2,716
People are in real trouble.


1916
1:29:2,716 --> 1:29:7,682
We acted to move to bring relief to the people who need the most help now.


1917
1:29:7,682 --> 1:29:13,457
And — and in the process, we 
— in case you haven't noticed, we have strong disagreements.


1918
1:29:13,457 --> 1:29:18,475
But I — you probably detected my frustration with their attitude


1919
1:29:18,475 --> 1:29:21,164
about the — the American people.


1920
1:29:21,164 --> 1:29:24,51
My friend says that 30% of the American people are takers.


1921
1:29:24,51 --> 1:29:27,931
They — Romney points out, 47%of the people


1922
1:29:27,931 --> 1:29:30,479
won't take responsibility.


1923
1:29:30,479 --> 1:29:32,271
He's talking about my mother and father.


1924
1:29:32,271 --> 1:29:34,17
And he's talking about the places I grew up in,


1925
1:29:34,17 --> 1:29:35,884
my neighbors in Scranton and Claymont.


1926
1:29:35,884 --> 1:29:37,476
He's talking about —


1927
1:29:37,476 --> 1:29:39,947
he's talking about the people that have built this country.


1928
1:29:39,947 --> 1:29:43,642
All they're looking for, Martha — all they're looking for is an even shot.


1929
1:29:43,642 --> 1:29:46,202
When they've been given the shot, they've done it.


1930
1:29:46,202 --> 1:29:47,378
They've done it.


1931
1:29:47,378 --> 1:29:49,896
Whenever you level the playing field, they've been able to move.


1932
1:29:49,896 --> 1:29:51,888
And they want a little bit of peace of mind.


1933
1:29:51,888 --> 1:29:54,386
And the president and I are not going to rest


1934
1:29:54,386 --> 1:29:57,42
until that playing field is leveled,


1935
1:29:57,42 --> 1:30:0,372
they in fact have a clear shot and they have peace of mind,


1936
1:30:0,372 --> 1:30:3,144
until they can turn to their kid and say with a degree of confidence,


1937
1:30:3,144 --> 1:30:7,357
honey, it's going to be OK. It's going to be OK.


1938
1:30:7,357 --> 1:30:11,407
That's what this is all about.


1939
1:30:11,407 --> 1:30:12,937
[Raddatz] Congressman Ryan.


1940
1:30:12,937 --> 1:30:16,225
[Ryan] I want to thank you as well, Martha, Danville, Kentucky, Centre College.


1941
1:30:16,225 --> 1:30:18,455
And I want to thank you, Joe.


1942
1:30:18,455 --> 1:30:22,184
It's been an honor to engage in this critical debate.


1943
1:30:22,184 --> 1:30:27,999
We face a very big choice. What kind of country are we going to be?


1944
1:30:27,999 --> 1:30:31,935
What kind of country are we going to give our kids?


1945
1:30:31,935 --> 1:30:34,359
President Obama — he had his chance.


1946
1:30:34,359 --> 1:30:36,109
He made his choices.


1947
1:30:36,109 --> 1:30:40,34
His economic agenda, more spending, more borrowing, higher taxes,


1948
1:30:40,34 --> 1:30:44,704
a government takeover of health care — it's not working.


1949
1:30:44,704 --> 1:30:46,755
It's failed to create the jobs we need.


1950
1:30:46,755 --> 1:30:49,751
23 million Americans are struggling for work today.


1951
1:30:49,751 --> 1:30:53,19
15% of Americans are in poverty.


1952
1:30:53,19 --> 1:30:56,182
This is not what a real recovery looks like.


1953
1:30:56,182 --> 1:31:2,649
You deserve better. Mitt Romney and I want to earn your support.


1954
1:31:2,649 --> 1:31:7,62
We're offering real reforms for a real recovery for every American.


1955
1:31:7,62 --> 1:31:12,784
Mitt Romney, his experience, his ideas, his solutions,


1956
1:31:12,784 --> 1:31:16,432
is uniquely qualified to get this job done.


1957
1:31:16,432 --> 1:31:18,717
At a time when we have a jobs crisis in America,


1958
1:31:18,717 --> 1:31:21,77
wouldn't it be nice to have a job creator in the White House?


1959
1:31:21,77 --> 1:31:23,774
The choice is clear:


1960
1:31:23,774 --> 1:31:28,85
a stagnant economy that promotes more government dependency,


1961
1:31:28,85 --> 1:31:33,548
or a dynamic, growing economy that promotes opportunity and jobs.


1962
1:31:33,548 --> 1:31:37,614
Mitt Romney and I will not duck the tough issues.


1963
1:31:37,614 --> 1:31:42,24
And we will not blame others for the next 4 years. We will take responsibility.


1964
1:31:42,24 --> 1:31:46,603
And we will not try to replace our founding principles;


1965
1:31:46,603 --> 1:31:49,49
we will reapply our founding principles.


1966
1:31:49,49 --> 1:31:53,759
The choice is clear, and the choice rests with you,


1967
1:31:53,759 --> 1:31:57,33
and we ask you for your vote. Thank you.


1968
1:31:57,33 --> 1:31:59,737
[Raddatz] And thank you both again. Thank you very much.


1969
1:31:59,737 --> 1:32:2,133
[Raddatz] This concludes the vice presidential debate.


1970
1:32:2,133 --> 1:32:6,341
Please tune in next Tuesday for the second presidential debate


1971
1:32:6,341 --> 1:32:8,9
at Hofstra University in New York.


1972
1:32:8,9 --> 1:32:10,486
I'm Martha Raddatz of ABC News.


1973
1:32:10,486 --> 1:32:13,332
I do hope all of you go to the polls. Have a good evening. (Applause.)
