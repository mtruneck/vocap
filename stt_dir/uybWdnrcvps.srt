0:0:0,405 --> 0:0:3,493
[KIRK] Captain’s Log: Stardate 7232.5.


2
0:0:3,493 --> 0:0:7,235
The Enterprise has spent the last 2 weeks
mapping a previously unexplored sector.


3
0:0:7,235 --> 0:0:12,816
Long range sensors indicate a rich uradium vein
on the seventh planet of an uninhabited system.


4
0:0:12,816 --> 0:0:16,302
A landing party is investigating.


5
0:0:16,302 --> 0:0:17,537
[scanners hum]


6
0:0:17,537 --> 0:0:19,97
[McCOY] Jim, I don't know why we're taking this risk.


7
0:0:19,97 --> 0:0:23,97
I mean one false move and a chain reaction could
blow away half this continent.


8
0:0:23,97 --> 0:0:27,238
Uridium may be unstable, Bones, but it's essential
to starship construction.


9
0:0:27,238 --> 0:0:32,5
A source in this sector is going to be extremely
important to the Federation for many years to come.


10
0:0:32,5 --> 0:0:34,869
Besides...


11
0:0:34,869 --> 0:0:37,724
I trust my people.


12
0:0:37,724 --> 0:0:41,334
[scanners hum]


13
0:0:41,334 --> 0:0:43,37
He's suffered a terrible loss, Jim.


14
0:0:43,37 --> 0:0:45,607
Freeman meant everything to him.


15
0:0:45,607 --> 0:0:48,0
Duty leaves little time for personal pain.


16
0:0:48,0 --> 0:0:51,473
Or personal relationships?


17
0:0:51,473 --> 0:0:52,891
Like Uncle, like Nephew.


18
0:0:52,891 --> 0:0:54,61
You both ignore what you can't control:


19
0:0:54,61 --> 0:0:56,97
Grief, family.


20
0:0:56,97 --> 0:0:58,401
Don't you see?


21
0:0:58,401 --> 0:1:3,523
No amount of throwing yourselves into
work is going to make either disappear.


22
0:1:3,523 --> 0:1:5,243
We WERE having a conversation.


23
0:1:5,243 --> 0:1:8,4
You were psychoanalysing, Bones.
I wasn't listening.


24
0:1:8,4 --> 0:1:11,97
[SPOCK] Preliminary scans indicate a rich deposit
close to the surface.


25
0:1:11,97 --> 0:1:14,97
There will be minimal danger in extracting it.
An extraordinary find.


26
0:1:14,97 --> 0:1:17,501
Let's mark this vein and wrap things up, Spock.


27
0:1:17,501 --> 0:1:20,371
[communicator chirp]
Kirk to Enterprise, come in.


28
0:1:20,371 --> 0:1:20,971
[static]


29
0:1:20,971 --> 0:1:23,901
Kirk to Enterprise, come in.


30
0:1:23,901 --> 0:1:28,5
The signal is being jammed... locally.


31
0:1:28,5 --> 0:1:31,35
[explosion]


32
0:1:31,35 --> 0:1:34,4
[DICKERSON] Arrrghh!


33
0:1:34,4 --> 0:1:48,6
[explosions]


34
0:1:48,6 --> 0:1:49,97
[McCOY] What the devil's going on?


35
0:1:49,97 --> 0:1:51,97
[KIRK] The big question is...


36
0:1:51,97 --> 0:2:3,401
What's going on up there?


37
0:2:3,401 --> 0:2:9,669
[Main Theme]


38
0:2:9,669 --> 0:2:11,1
Space,


39
0:2:11,1 --> 0:2:17,501
The Final Frontier...


40
0:2:17,501 --> 0:2:21,901
These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise.


41
0:2:21,901 --> 0:2:23,901
its five year mission...


42
0:2:23,901 --> 0:2:26,401
To explore strange new worlds...


43
0:2:26,401 --> 0:2:30,401
To seek out new life and new civilisations.


44
0:2:30,401 --> 0:2:31,901
To boldly go...


45
0:2:31,901 --> 0:3:6,355
Where no man has gone before.


46
0:3:6,355 --> 0:3:8,65
[KIRK] Captain's log: supplemental.


47
0:3:8,65 --> 0:3:10,698
During a general mining survey
on an uninhabited planet....


48
0:3:10,698 --> 0:3:12,201
We've been attacked.


49
0:3:12,201 --> 0:3:13,808
Security Chief Dickerson:


50
0:3:13,808 --> 0:3:14,621
Dead.


51
0:3:14,621 --> 0:3:17,59
In orbit a similar ambush.


52
0:3:17,59 --> 0:3:18,608
Reason or reasons:


53
0:3:18,608 --> 0:3:19,823
Unknown.


54
0:3:19,823 --> 0:3:22,531
[RAND]
Deflector screens raised.


55
0:3:22,531 --> 0:3:25,281
[rumble]


56
0:3:25,281 --> 0:3:30,777
[XON] Minimal damage. Weapons and shields are class 13.


57
0:3:30,777 --> 0:3:33,93
They're not acknowledging hails, Mr DeSalle


58
0:3:33,93 --> 0:3:35,41
Phasers set to one half.


59
0:3:35,41 --> 0:3:38,191
Locked.


60
0:3:38,191 --> 0:3:40,638
Fire.


61
0:3:40,638 --> 0:3:43,198
[phaser fire]


62
0:3:43,198 --> 0:3:45,191
Hostile’s weapons are offline.


63
0:3:45,191 --> 0:3:46,882
Uhura, try to raise the landing party.


64
0:3:46,882 --> 0:3:48,9
[UHURA]
Aye, sir.


65
0:3:48,9 --> 0:3:50,653
Re-establish orbit, Mr Kyle.


66
0:3:50,653 --> 0:3:52,59
Xon, Scan for human lifesigns.


67
0:3:52,59 --> 0:3:54,543
Have the transporter room standby.


68
0:3:54,543 --> 0:3:56,695
Still no contact with the planet, sir.


69
0:3:56,695 --> 0:4:5,746
[phaser fire]


70
0:4:5,746 --> 0:4:18,522
[phaser fire]


71
0:4:18,522 --> 0:4:27,785
[groans]


72
0:4:27,785 --> 0:4:29,812
[CHEKOV]
Keptin!


73
0:4:29,812 --> 0:4:37,963
[phaser stuns]


74
0:4:37,963 --> 0:4:38,95
[PETER]
Damn!


75
0:4:38,95 --> 0:4:41,59
[KIRK]
Bones!


76
0:4:41,59 --> 0:4:44,17
[engines humming]


77
0:4:44,17 --> 0:4:46,575
[PETER]
I'm all right.


78
0:4:46,575 --> 0:4:48,646
[SPOCK]
The hostiles have retreated.


79
0:4:48,646 --> 0:4:51,764
But communications are still being jammed by
a device on the surface.


80
0:4:51,764 --> 0:4:58,626
[KIRK]
Find it.


81
0:4:58,626 --> 0:5:1,304
[KIRK]
Who are you?
Why did you attack us?


82
0:5:1,304 --> 0:5:2,778
All your kind...


83
0:5:2,778 --> 0:5:8,126
... will pay


84
0:5:8,126 --> 0:5:21,214
[loud hum]


85
0:5:21,214 --> 0:5:25,405
[humming stops]


86
0:5:25,405 --> 0:5:28,5
[communicator chirps]


87
0:5:28,5 --> 0:5:29,383
Kirk here.


88
0:5:29,383 --> 0:5:31,724
Communications restored.


89
0:5:31,724 --> 0:5:33,155
Kirk to Enterprise.


90
0:5:33,155 --> 0:5:34,889
[DeSALLE]
Enterprise, DeSalle here.


91
0:5:34,889 --> 0:5:37,974
Captain, we've been attacked but are undamaged.


92
0:5:37,974 --> 0:5:41,193
An alien ship of unknown design.
We disabled their weapons...


93
0:5:41,193 --> 0:5:44,442
...but they've taken on a landing pod
and are fleeing the system.


94
0:5:44,442 --> 0:5:49,27
Mr DeSalle, the landing party needs an emergency beam-out.
Have medical and security standing by in the transporter room.


95
0:5:49,27 --> 0:5:57,112
Plot a pursuit course on that alien vessel.


96
0:5:57,112 --> 0:5:59,284
Still no response to our hails, sir.


97
0:5:59,284 --> 0:6:0,974
Ve are falling back, Keptin.


98
0:6:0,974 --> 0:6:1,914
Scotty...


99
0:6:1,914 --> 0:6:4,9
They're a wee bit faster, sir. We're stoking the boilers.


100
0:6:4,9 --> 0:6:6,68
How's the captive, Bones?


101
0:6:6,68 --> 0:6:10,864
He's sedated. He's got a concussion
but otherwise he's fine.


102
0:6:10,864 --> 0:6:13,356
Now you're nephew on the other hand is beating...


103
0:6:13,356 --> 0:6:15,7
[KIRK, annoyed]
The business of this ship--


104
0:6:15,7 --> 0:6:18,6
He was distracted on the planet.
He could've been killed.


105
0:6:18,6 --> 0:6:20,274
[McCOY]
Whose distraction are you worried about?


106
0:6:20,274 --> 0:6:23,828
HIS... or YOURS?


107
0:6:23,828 --> 0:6:27,22
[McCOY]
Now you have an opportunity here
to be a real father figure.


108
0:6:27,22 --> 0:6:30,494
Maybe you are more comfortable
as his Captain. But what that boy needs--


109
0:6:30,494 --> 0:6:34,338
[KIRK]
What I need is my ship's Chief Medical Officer
to attend to ship's business.


110
0:6:34,338 --> 0:6:38,41
We're at Red Alert.
Now get the prisoner ready for questioning.


111
0:6:38,41 --> 0:6:39,205
Of course, CAPTAIN.


112
0:6:39,205 --> 0:6:40,742
[KIRK]
Spock, hostile's position?


113
0:6:40,742 --> 0:6:43,968
They have exceeded our maximum speed
and are slipping out of sensor range.


114
0:6:43,968 --> 0:6:45,297
Scotty, We can't lose them.


115
0:6:45,297 --> 0:6:46,869
We're givin' it all we've got, sir.


116
0:6:46,869 --> 0:6:49,26
[CHEKOV]
Keptin, I'm reading several wessels incoming.


117
0:6:49,26 --> 0:6:50,97
[SPOCK]
Confirmed.


118
0:6:50,97 --> 0:6:58,921
Nine vessesls. Similar to the alien
hostiles, on an intercept course.


119
0:6:58,921 --> 0:7:0,799
DeSalle, tactical report.


120
0:7:0,799 --> 0:7:4,216
They've got speed on their side, sir, but our weapons
and shields completely outclass them.


121
0:7:4,216 --> 0:7:5,468
They haven't got a prayer.


122
0:7:5,468 --> 0:7:8,735
[KIRK] Mr Sulu, maintain course, reduce speed.
[SULU] Aye, sir.


123
0:7:8,735 --> 0:7:11,595
Open a channel, Lieutenant.
Let's give them one more chance.


124
0:7:11,595 --> 0:7:13,23
[UHURA]
Aye, sir.


125
0:7:13,23 --> 0:7:14,7
Channel open.


126
0:7:14,7 --> 0:7:18,473
This is Captain James T. Kirk of the
Federation Starship Enterprise.


127
0:7:18,473 --> 0:7:22,265
We have aboard a member of your team
from the unprovoked attack on our vessel.


128
0:7:22,265 --> 0:7:26,41
Standby to prepare--
[rumbles]


129
0:7:26,41 --> 0:7:30,565
Unremarkable lasers and weak gravitic torpedoes.
Minimal damage to our shields.


130
0:7:30,565 --> 0:7:32,785
[KIRK]
Uhura?


131
0:7:32,785 --> 0:7:34,96
[rumbles]


132
0:7:34,96 --> 0:7:39,589
[CHEKOV]
This makes no sense. Ve'd have to lower
our screens for them to do any damage.


133
0:7:39,589 --> 0:7:45,762
[SPOCK]
On the contrary, Mr Chekov. They're concentrating
their fire on one area near our starboard nacelle strut.


134
0:7:45,762 --> 0:7:51,103
They appear familiar with our configuration. They
will eventually break through our shields at that point.


135
0:7:51,103 --> 0:7:56,444
[KIRK]
Mr Scott, reinforce the starboard shields.
Chekov: Half phasers. Warn them off.


136
0:7:56,444 --> 0:8:1,18
[CHEKOV]
Aye, sir.


137
0:8:1,18 --> 0:8:6,222
One alien vessel has taken heavy damage and is
losing life support. Another has lost warp power.


138
0:8:6,222 --> 0:8:10,2
[KIRK] That's a warning, Mr Chekov?
[CHEKOV] I'm sorry, sir. They're more fragile than expected.


139
0:8:10,2 --> 0:8:11,459
[torpedoes crash]


140
0:8:11,459 --> 0:8:18,978
[SPOCK]
Shields on starboard nacelle strut down 3 per cent.


141
0:8:18,978 --> 0:8:21,62
[CHEKOV]
It's like being attacked by...


142
0:8:21,62 --> 0:8:22,15
... kittens.


143
0:8:22,15 --> 0:8:25,544
[SPOCK]
Indeed.  But given enough time
their claws WILL do damage.


144
0:8:25,544 --> 0:8:29,429
[KIRK]
I'm not just going to order their destruction.
Why won't they communicate with us?


145
0:8:29,429 --> 0:8:34,249
[SPOCK]
They must believe doing so would
be less fruitful then their attack.


146
0:8:34,249 --> 0:8:39,255
Security to Sickbay.
I want the prisoner brought to the bridge.


147
0:8:39,255 --> 0:8:43,937
[phaser fire]
[deflector hits]


148
0:8:43,937 --> 0:8:51,13
[doors open]


149
0:8:51,13 --> 0:8:53,803
[KIRK]
Who are you? Why did you attack us?


150
0:8:53,803 --> 0:8:55,803
My name is Alkar Kyril...


151
0:8:55,803 --> 0:8:57,923
Adjutant Commander of the Ninth Peshan Fleet.


152
0:8:57,923 --> 0:9:0,359
You will get no more from me.


153
0:9:0,359 --> 0:9:2,787
[KIRK]
We're not here to harm you or your people.


154
0:9:2,787 --> 0:9:4,861
If they'd simply respond to our hails...


155
0:9:4,861 --> 0:9:10,551
KYRIL:
OUR hails have always been answered by insult
and invasion. Why would we answer yours?


156
0:9:10,551 --> 0:9:12,613
Impressive.


157
0:9:12,613 --> 0:9:16,12
Are you mercenaries?
Or Alersa's new personal toy?


158
0:9:16,12 --> 0:9:19,47
[KIRK]
Alersa? Listen I don't know
anybody named Alersa.


159
0:9:19,47 --> 0:9:20,726
We're not your enemy.


160
0:9:20,726 --> 0:9:24,216
[KYRIL]
You may as well kill me now.
Your Meskan mind tricks won't work.


161
0:9:24,216 --> 0:9:28,471
[KIRK]
Meskan? We're NOT Meskan. We represent
the United Federation of Planets.


162
0:9:28,471 --> 0:9:30,4
We're here on a peaceful mission.


163
0:9:30,4 --> 0:9:32,964
[explosion]


164
0:9:32,964 --> 0:9:34,825
[KYRIL]
Meskan murderer!


165
0:9:34,825 --> 0:9:36,656
200 people!


166
0:9:36,656 --> 0:9:38,355
On each interceptor!


167
0:9:38,355 --> 0:9:41,82
[CHEKOV]
Ve didn't fire.


168
0:9:41,82 --> 0:9:42,266
[SULU]
Captain!


169
0:9:42,266 --> 0:9:43,151
[KYRIL]
There!


170
0:9:43,151 --> 0:10:16,32
Perjure yourself again as the evidence
against you destroys my fleet!


171
0:10:16,32 --> 0:10:17,265
[MCCOY]
Jim?


172
0:10:17,265 --> 0:10:20,107
Is that one of our ships?


173
0:10:20,107 --> 0:10:23,313
[SCOTTY]
Sir, the Eagle was lost 8 years ago with all hands.


174
0:10:23,313 --> 0:10:24,995
[KIRK]
On the other side of the quadrant.


175
0:10:24,995 --> 0:10:26,978
[SPOCK]
There's been significant alteration.


176
0:10:26,978 --> 0:10:29,94
Armour plating, disruptor canons.


177
0:10:29,94 --> 0:10:33,383
But it is the Eagle, Captain. And she's
attacking Peshan ships with alacrity.


178
0:10:33,383 --> 0:10:36,139
[KIRK]
Mr Scott extend our shields to cover them.


179
0:10:36,139 --> 0:10:40,31
[SCOTTY]
We can't protect them all, sir. And the ones
we can -- it'll take some doing to maintain.


180
0:10:40,31 --> 0:10:41,58
[KIRK]
Do it.


181
0:10:41,58 --> 0:10:43,528
Lieutenant Uhura, try to raise the Eagle.


182
0:10:43,528 --> 0:10:45,35
[UHURA]
They're jamming all channels, sir.


183
0:10:45,35 --> 0:10:47,94
[CHEKOV]
Keptin, they are picking off the Peshan
ships von by von.


184
0:10:47,94 --> 0:10:56,173
[KIRK]
Mr Sulu, put us between them.
Change course: two thirteen mark six.


185
0:10:56,173 --> 0:10:58,524
[SPOCK]
Another Peshan vessel has been destroyed.


186
0:10:58,524 --> 0:10:59,553
[rumble]


187
0:10:59,553 --> 0:11:2,52
[SPOCK]
Yet they continue to attack us from
within our own shields.


188
0:11:2,52 --> 0:11:3,773
[KIRK]
Release him.


189
0:11:3,773 --> 0:11:5,912
Tell your people we're trying to
protect them.


190
0:11:5,912 --> 0:11:7,769
[KYRIL]
They won't listen.


191
0:11:7,769 --> 0:11:9,246
They'll assume subterfuge.


192
0:11:9,246 --> 0:11:12,522
[SPOCK]
One Peshan vessel on collision
course -- attempting to ram.


193
0:11:12,522 --> 0:11:25,495
[KIRK]
Tractor beam.


194
0:11:25,495 --> 0:11:27,708
[SPOCK]
Damage to secondary hull.


195
0:11:27,708 --> 0:11:29,569
[CHEKOV]
Shields are buckling, sir.


196
0:11:29,569 --> 0:11:32,239
[UHURA]
Damage control teams. Decks 18 to 21.


197
0:11:32,239 --> 0:11:34,339
[SULU]
The Peshans are breaking away from our shields.


198
0:11:34,339 --> 0:11:36,423
[CHEKOV]
Eagle is altering course to pursue.


199
0:11:36,423 --> 0:11:39,124
[SPOCK]
They cannot withstand an assault
outside our protection.


200
0:11:39,124 --> 0:11:41,276
[KIRK]
Lock phasers on the Eagle, Mr Chekov.


201
0:11:41,276 --> 0:11:44,277
[SPOCK]
Eagle now targeting us. Both phasers
and disruptor banks.


202
0:11:44,277 --> 0:11:45,572
[KIRK]
Evasive.


203
0:11:45,572 --> 0:11:53,633
[phasers fire]


204
0:11:53,633 --> 0:11:56,975
[KIRK]
Return fire, Mr Chekov.
I want that ship disabled.


205
0:11:56,975 --> 0:12:3,442
[phaser fire]


206
0:12:3,442 --> 0:12:6,43
[CHEKOV]
Little effect against their armour plating, Keptin.


207
0:12:6,43 --> 0:12:8,148
[KIRK]
Spock. The prefix codes.


208
0:12:8,148 --> 0:12:9,827
[SPOCK]
The prefix code may be intact,


209
0:12:9,827 --> 0:12:13,158
but normal ship to ship communication
links are jammed.


210
0:12:13,158 --> 0:12:16,242
[KIRK]
Change our codes.


211
0:12:16,242 --> 0:12:18,73
[KIRK]
The Eagle. How long?


212
0:12:18,73 --> 0:12:20,126
[KYRIL]
Eight years now.


213
0:12:20,126 --> 0:12:22,122
You really don't know?


214
0:12:22,122 --> 0:12:23,426
This isn't a trick?


215
0:12:23,426 --> 0:12:25,687
A trick? Commander Kyril this is a nightmare.


216
0:12:25,687 --> 0:12:28,589
Who commands that ship?


217
0:12:28,589 --> 0:12:29,717
[KIRK]
Now!


218
0:12:29,717 --> 0:12:31,14
[KYRIL]
Alersa.


219
0:12:31,14 --> 0:12:33,28
A vile, dangerous creature.


220
0:12:33,28 --> 0:12:37,271
She and her crew worm their way onto free vessels,
twisting innocent minds into doing their bidding.


221
0:12:37,271 --> 0:12:38,635
[SPOCK]
Telepaths?


222
0:12:38,635 --> 0:12:41,457
[KYRIL]
No, they don't read minds. They're psychomorphs.


223
0:12:41,457 --> 0:12:46,221
Twisting the perceptions of others and forcing
their wills on those who are receptive.


224
0:12:46,221 --> 0:12:48,748
The Meskan used to revile
those with such power but...


225
0:12:48,748 --> 0:12:53,244
Now they've risen for control and
cast Alersa as their saviour.


226
0:12:53,244 --> 0:12:55,149
What do they need to be saved from?


227
0:12:55,149 --> 0:12:59,853
We're not proud of it, but far in Peshan history,
my people subjugated the Meskan.


228
0:12:59,853 --> 0:13:3,97
Alersa is now bent on revenge.


229
0:13:3,97 --> 0:13:8,652
Captain, they've devastated our fleet
from 700 strong to fewer than 70.


230
0:13:8,652 --> 0:13:13,256
No matter our past crimes, this is not justice.


231
0:13:13,256 --> 0:13:15,477
[KIRK]
Evasive means to evade, Mr Chekov.


232
0:13:15,477 --> 0:13:19,863
[SULU]
They've reconfigured their thruster ports
and impulse drive, sir. They outrun us at sub-light.


233
0:13:19,863 --> 0:13:21,919
Let's show them what these engines can do.


234
0:13:21,919 --> 0:13:23,612
Aye, sir.


235
0:13:23,612 --> 0:13:25,469
[strong phaser fire]


236
0:13:25,469 --> 0:13:27,76
[explosions]


237
0:13:27,76 --> 0:13:29,458
[CHEKOV] Aarrgghh!


238
0:13:29,458 --> 0:13:34,972
[KIRK]
Bones!


239
0:13:34,972 --> 0:13:37,157
[SENTELL]
Dorsel shields weakening.


240
0:13:37,157 --> 0:13:39,827
[UHURA]
They've blown the long-range subspace transceiver.


241
0:13:39,827 --> 0:13:43,706
[KIRK]
Sentell, Torpedoes. Deck 24.
There's no armour there.


242
0:13:43,706 --> 0:13:48,18
[torpedo fires]


243
0:13:48,18 --> 0:13:52,69
[SPOCK]
We've damaged their cargo bay.
Section 3A. They're breaking off.


244
0:13:52,69 --> 0:13:55,891
They're the bully on the block, Spock.
They're not used to having a bloody nose.


245
0:13:55,891 --> 0:13:58,179
[KYRIL]
But there's no strategic value there.


246
0:13:58,179 --> 0:14:1,451
[KIRK]
Oh yes there is. It's a coolant system for their
weapon's subsystems.


247
0:14:1,451 --> 0:14:4,52
There's bypasses but they may
not know about them.


248
0:14:4,52 --> 0:14:6,322
[UHURA]
Captain, the Eagle is hailing.


249
0:14:6,322 --> 0:14:9,691
It's a non-standard frequency. All other
channels are still blocked, sir.


250
0:14:9,691 --> 0:14:11,841
[KIRK]
Stall them.  Analyse that signal.


251
0:14:11,841 --> 0:14:14,907
If we can get into those computers
while their weapons are down...


252
0:14:14,907 --> 0:14:16,248
[UHURA]
Aye, sir.


253
0:14:16,248 --> 0:14:32,905
[KIRK]
Commander Kyril, we're going to set this right.


254
0:14:32,905 --> 0:14:36,821
[CHEKOV]
I need to get back up there.


255
0:14:36,821 --> 0:14:38,837
[McCOY]
Nurse...


256
0:14:38,837 --> 0:14:40,111
[CHEKOV]
Vill that help?


257
0:14:40,111 --> 0:14:41,561
[McCOY]
Yeah... me.


258
0:14:41,561 --> 0:14:43,964
It'll paralyse your fingers.


259
0:14:43,964 --> 0:14:46,62
[CHEKOV]
Vhere did you intern? A gulag?


260
0:14:46,62 --> 0:14:49,888
[MCCOY]
I haven't killed you... yet.


261
0:14:49,888 --> 0:14:52,875
[CHEKOV]
And how are you doing, Mr Kirk?


262
0:14:52,875 --> 0:14:56,167
Other than my destroyed career?


263
0:14:56,167 --> 0:15:1,473
I wasn't thinking down there.
I rushed out. Got myself shot.


264
0:15:1,473 --> 0:15:3,449
Stupid mistake.


265
0:15:3,449 --> 0:15:5,571
I endangered the whole landing party.


266
0:15:5,571 --> 0:15:7,57
The ship.


267
0:15:7,57 --> 0:15:10,569
I'm sure my uncle is drawing
up the transfer orders himself.


268
0:15:10,569 --> 0:15:13,616
[CHEKOV]
Yes. He probably is.


269
0:15:13,616 --> 0:15:17,31
Ve are in the middle of a battle
with two unknown attack forces.


270
0:15:17,31 --> 0:15:21,589
The security guard who dashed instead
of crawled on the planet's surface


271
0:15:21,589 --> 0:15:23,135
is foremost on the captain's mind.


272
0:15:23,135 --> 0:15:25,812
My actions could have
gotten people killed.


273
0:15:25,812 --> 0:15:27,788
Perhaps it vas a clever diversion.


274
0:15:27,788 --> 0:15:30,68
[PETER]
It wasn't. It was a mistake.


275
0:15:30,68 --> 0:15:35,476
Ensign, if you continue to crucify yourself like
this you're going to drive yourself insane.


276
0:15:35,476 --> 0:15:38,204
Listen to him. He's speaking
from experience.


277
0:15:38,204 --> 0:15:42,813
Mistakes are supposed to be a learning experience.
If I don't examine them I won't learn.


278
0:15:42,813 --> 0:15:46,614
[CHEKOV]
And that's something most people
never understand.


279
0:15:46,614 --> 0:15:51,918
It's examine. Not dissect.


280
0:15:51,918 --> 0:15:54,5
Thank you, Lieutenant.


281
0:15:54,5 --> 0:15:55,535
Sir, am I fit for duty?


282
0:15:55,535 --> 0:15:57,762
[McCOY]
Yeah. But your shift has ended.


283
0:15:57,762 --> 0:16:0,229
Take advantage of the downtime.
Doctor's orders.


284
0:16:0,229 --> 0:16:3,5
We're at Red Alert.
I'm needed at my station.


285
0:16:3,5 --> 0:16:7,613
Ensign, someone else will cover your
station. Give yourself a break.


286
0:16:7,613 --> 0:16:15,628
Go. You can save the
galaxy tomorrow.


287
0:16:15,628 --> 0:16:19,405
[doors open and close]


288
0:16:19,405 --> 0:16:21,79
Remind you of anyone you know?


289
0:16:21,79 --> 0:16:25,976
[CHEKOV]
Yes. But he doesn't need to punish
himself for everything.


290
0:16:25,976 --> 0:16:30,908
Of course not. He's not Russian.


291
0:16:30,908 --> 0:16:33,117
Am I fit for duty now, Doctor?


292
0:16:33,117 --> 0:16:37,852
Nope. But that's never stopped you before.


293
0:16:37,852 --> 0:16:52,396
Go on. You're released. Get out of here.


294
0:16:52,396 --> 0:16:54,928
[RAND]
We're in, sir.


295
0:16:54,928 --> 0:16:57,464
They've replaced many of
the computer systems.


296
0:16:57,464 --> 0:17:1,925
[UHURA]
These changes are acting like a firewall.
There's no remote access from here, sir.


297
0:17:1,925 --> 0:17:12,765
[KIRK]
Then get me their logs from
as far back as you can.


298
0:17:12,765 --> 0:17:14,985
[SULU]
Done slacking?


299
0:17:14,985 --> 0:17:18,973
[CHEKOV]
I am not the one who vas malingering
on extended leave.


300
0:17:18,973 --> 0:17:22,168
There's more to life than
Starfleet, my friend.


301
0:17:22,168 --> 0:17:25,153
[CHEKOV scoffs]
Lies.


302
0:17:25,153 --> 0:17:27,261
[UHURA]
Captain, we're locked out.


303
0:17:27,261 --> 0:17:29,335
We've retrieved some of the logs.


304
0:17:29,335 --> 0:17:30,718
Nothing recent.


305
0:17:30,718 --> 0:17:33,265
[RAND]
They're going to take some time to decrypt.


306
0:17:33,265 --> 0:17:44,183
[KIRK]
Then let's buy some.
Uhura, patch me through.


307
0:17:44,183 --> 0:17:46,203
Alersa?


308
0:17:46,203 --> 0:17:49,204
Don't be fooled, Captain,
she's quite deadly.


309
0:17:49,204 --> 0:17:52,557
Especially in person.


310
0:17:52,557 --> 0:17:54,714
I'll take that under advisement.


311
0:17:54,714 --> 0:17:59,674
[ALERSA]
It seems we've gotten off on
the wrong foot, Captain Pike.


312
0:17:59,674 --> 0:18:3,499
It's Captain Kirk. Your library
computers are out of date.


313
0:18:3,499 --> 0:18:7,45
Captain Kirk. You'll forgive me, of course.


314
0:18:7,45 --> 0:18:11,45
Of course, now just return that ship.


315
0:18:11,45 --> 0:18:12,845
Oh, dear.


316
0:18:12,845 --> 0:18:16,817
You're going to be difficult.
How disappointing.


317
0:18:16,817 --> 0:18:21,206
Do you really expect me to give
up such a comfortable ship.


318
0:18:21,206 --> 0:18:22,738
It's so...


319
0:18:22,738 --> 0:18:24,574
cosy.


320
0:18:24,574 --> 0:18:29,7
Well, perhaps we can come to
an understanding, Captain.


321
0:18:29,7 --> 0:18:31,901
I could send a shuttlecraft
for you, if you like.


322
0:18:31,901 --> 0:18:39,166
And we could discuss an armistice
of sorts, here... on my flagship.


323
0:18:39,166 --> 0:18:43,766
I could even give you a tour of
the improvements we've made.


324
0:18:43,766 --> 0:18:50,735
That's an interesting proposal but why don't I just
slit my throat right now and save you all the trouble.


325
0:18:50,735 --> 0:18:53,271
You would do that for... 


326
0:18:53,271 --> 0:18:56,444
little old me?


327
0:18:56,444 --> 0:18:59,267
[KYRIL]
I've warned him about you, Alersa.


328
0:18:59,267 --> 0:19:2,873
He's not going to put himself in your clutches.


329
0:19:2,873 --> 0:19:5,956
Alkar. I hope you're well and...


330
0:19:5,956 --> 0:19:8,525
...and how are the rest of your family?


331
0:19:8,525 --> 0:19:10,381
Oh...


332
0:19:10,381 --> 0:19:11,856
Oh, dear.


333
0:19:11,856 --> 0:19:14,615
I miscounted.


334
0:19:14,615 --> 0:19:17,316
NONE are left.


335
0:19:17,316 --> 0:19:21,416
I don't suppose you'd like to beam over to
this vessel and we'll have a little chat.


336
0:19:21,416 --> 0:19:22,912
[ALERSA]
Beaming?


337
0:19:22,912 --> 0:19:25,17
Yes, the transporters.


338
0:19:25,17 --> 0:19:30,949
That is one technology that we
have been unable to decipher.


339
0:19:30,949 --> 0:19:34,654
Kirk, if you'd be willing to
let my technicians...


340
0:19:34,654 --> 0:19:51,137
[KIRK]
That's not going to happen, Captain.


341
0:19:51,137 --> 0:19:55,281
[CONDRIS]
The codes are either
corrupt, or different.


342
0:19:55,281 --> 0:20:1,511
Oh, he's a clever boy. I'm sure he changed them
as soon as he realised we were a threat.


343
0:20:1,511 --> 0:20:5,259
He's not like that blue buffoon.


344
0:20:5,259 --> 0:20:9,154
Kirk is formidable.


345
0:20:9,154 --> 0:20:11,267
Do you fancy him?


346
0:20:11,267 --> 0:20:16,899
Careful, Andoch. A tongue as sharp
as yours could slit its own throat.


347
0:20:16,899 --> 0:20:21,908
Remember, darling, one can
never have too many pets.


348
0:20:21,908 --> 0:20:23,569
Condris, how long?


349
0:20:23,569 --> 0:20:25,845
[CONDRIS]
Any moment, m'lady.


350
0:20:25,845 --> 0:20:28,318
Excellent.


351
0:20:28,318 --> 0:20:34,333
[KIRK]
She's no fool. She knew those
codes would be changed.


352
0:20:34,333 --> 0:20:36,44
She's stalling. Why?


353
0:20:36,44 --> 0:20:39,655
[KYRIL]
She may be waiting for assistance.


354
0:20:39,655 --> 0:20:44,42
Our intelligence reports reveal she's
developed a new battleship


355
0:20:44,42 --> 0:20:48,6
We thought your vessel, one of them.
It's why we attacked you.


356
0:20:48,6 --> 0:20:51,653
[SPOCK]
Scanning...


357
0:20:51,653 --> 0:20:54,554
They're effectively hampering
our long range sensors.


358
0:20:54,554 --> 0:20:57,806
The disadvantage of their close
familiarity with our systems.


359
0:20:57,806 --> 0:21:1,228
[UHURA]
Eagle is hailing again, Captain.


360
0:21:1,228 --> 0:21:5,582
I'm sorry we couldn't come to an
understanding, Captain Kirk.


361
0:21:5,582 --> 0:21:8,31
Perhaps we'll renegotiate...


362
0:21:8,31 --> 0:21:30,958
When my boot is on your throat.


363
0:21:30,958 --> 0:21:32,928
[KIRK] Captain's log: supplemental.


364
0:21:32,928 --> 0:21:37,938
The U.S.S. Eagle, missing for eight
years, has been found in the
hands of alien aggressors.


365
0:21:37,938 --> 0:21:42,726
Reverse engineering our technology, they've
apparently created their own starships:


366
0:21:42,726 --> 0:21:46,668
An enemy Starfleet.


367
0:21:46,668 --> 0:21:48,133
Spock. Analysis.


368
0:21:48,133 --> 0:21:51,774
An interesting amalgam of Federation
and alien technologies, Captain.


369
0:21:51,774 --> 0:21:55,193
They have less of the inveterate armour
and weapons arrays of the Eagle.


370
0:21:55,193 --> 0:21:58,559
Of course. She keeps the most
powerful vessel under her control.


371
0:21:58,559 --> 0:22:1,269
Chekov, concentrate fire on
the newer ship.


372
0:22:1,269 --> 0:22:4,788
Mr Sulu, alternate warp and sub-light
attack vectors. Keep them guessing.


373
0:22:4,788 --> 0:22:11,272
[SULU]
Aye, sir.


374
0:22:11,272 --> 0:22:14,492
Protect the Starstalker.


375
0:22:14,492 --> 0:22:21,372
I have not come this far against
the Peshan to have it all taken
away by one Federation ship!


376
0:22:21,372 --> 0:22:23,79
Fight them, Andoch.


377
0:22:23,79 --> 0:22:39,388
Fight them as if your
life depends on it!


378
0:22:39,388 --> 0:22:41,542
[DeSALLE]
Coolant leak.
Deck 7, Section 2.


379
0:22:41,542 --> 0:22:46,352
[KIRK]
Damage Control. Deck 7, Section 2
Clear and Contain.


380
0:22:46,352 --> 0:22:48,256
[UHURA]
Engineering on the com, sir.


381
0:22:48,256 --> 0:22:49,952
[KIRK]
Scotty.


382
0:22:49,952 --> 0:22:52,195
[SCOTTY]
We've got three main power
couplings down, Captain.


383
0:22:52,195 --> 0:22:54,26
We've rerouted, but it's jury rigged.


384
0:22:54,26 --> 0:22:55,182
It'll take an hour to repair.


385
0:22:55,182 --> 0:22:56,671
Understood. Kirk out.


386
0:22:56,671 --> 0:23:0,4
[SPOCK]
The Meskan hybrid starship
is disabled and drifting.


387
0:23:0,4 --> 0:23:3,19
Sensors detect seven incoming contacts:


388
0:23:3,19 --> 0:23:4,418
Peshan design.


389
0:23:4,418 --> 0:23:7,778
[KIRK]
Kyril, you've got to make them
understand we're not their enemy.


390
0:23:7,778 --> 0:23:9,515
They won't believe me, Captain.


391
0:23:9,515 --> 0:23:11,864
They'll assume I'm under
psychomorphic control.


392
0:23:11,864 --> 0:23:14,888
[SPOCK]
The Eagle is changing course
turning on the Peshan.


393
0:23:14,888 --> 0:23:16,542
My god.


394
0:23:16,542 --> 0:23:18,83
Our technology is going to
slaughter the Peshan fleet.


395
0:23:18,83 --> 0:23:21,803
[SPOCk]
Full scan of the Eagle's current
configuration now complete.


396
0:23:21,803 --> 0:23:26,117
Reviewing it will take time, but it may
provide us with an exploitable weakness.


397
0:23:26,117 --> 0:23:29,782
And with Mr Scott needing an hour.... We've
got to find a way to knock out her screens.


398
0:23:29,782 --> 0:23:32,796
[SPOCK]
Those circuit nodes are heavily
protected from weapons fire.


399
0:23:32,796 --> 0:23:34,746
What about a stimulus overload?


400
0:23:34,746 --> 0:23:38,63
Possible. Such a flash would impair
our sensors as well, however.


401
0:23:38,63 --> 0:23:42,34
Leaving us open to attack from both
Peshan and Meskan forces.


402
0:23:42,34 --> 0:23:44,653
[KIRK]
It's a chance we're going to
have to take, Mr Spock.


403
0:23:44,653 --> 0:23:56,521
I don't want to see another ship
destroyed by a Starfleet vessel.


404
0:23:56,521 --> 0:23:58,523
[ALERSA]
What's happened?


405
0:23:58,523 --> 0:24:0,583
[ANDOCH]
Sensors are down across the grid.


406
0:24:0,583 --> 0:24:5,435
The Enterprise caused it. We cannot
accurately move or fire. We're blind.


407
0:24:5,435 --> 0:24:8,95
Then fire on Kirk's
last known position.


408
0:24:8,95 --> 0:24:9,845
Voral. Get those
sensors fixed.


409
0:24:9,845 --> 0:24:17,68
NOW!


410
0:24:17,68 --> 0:24:22,74
Mr Sulu, continue on the pre-plotted course
Get us some distance.


411
0:24:22,74 --> 0:24:24,218
[SULU]
Aye, sir.


412
0:24:24,218 --> 0:24:27,334
[SPOCK]
We're likely to recover sensors
simultaneously with the Eagle


413
0:24:27,334 --> 0:24:31,52
but the Peshan may
rebound more quickly.


414
0:24:31,52 --> 0:24:31,951
[SPOCK]
Confirmed.


415
0:24:31,951 --> 0:24:33,301
They already have.


416
0:24:33,301 --> 0:24:37,544
[KIRK]
Transfer all power to the deflector screens.
Stand down from battlestations.


417
0:24:37,544 --> 0:24:38,792
Mr DeSalle?


418
0:24:38,792 --> 0:24:41,86
[DeSALLE]
They'll hold against the
Peshan lasers, sir.


419
0:24:41,86 --> 0:24:46,19
[UHURA]
If we can get out of jamming range for
30 seconds, sir. I can send a burst
transmission to Starfleet Command.


420
0:24:46,19 --> 0:24:53,21
[KYRIL]
Captain, we can't wait for your fleet to arrive.
Those new ships of her's will destroy my people.


421
0:24:53,21 --> 0:24:57,567
[KIRK]
Lt Uhura. Get me the information
from the Eagle's logs.


422
0:24:57,567 --> 0:25:7,629
I want to know how to hurt her.
Mr Spock, you have the con.


423
0:25:7,629 --> 0:25:9,819
[KIRK]
Engineering.


424
0:25:9,819 --> 0:25:12,809
[McCOY]
Deck eight.


425
0:25:12,809 --> 0:25:36,256
One of your officers needs his captain.
I'd call that 'ship's business.'


426
0:25:36,256 --> 0:25:39,392
[PETER]
Enter.


427
0:25:39,392 --> 0:25:42,412
Captain...


428
0:25:42,412 --> 0:25:45,462
At ease, Ensign.


429
0:25:45,462 --> 0:25:50,336
I'd be on duty, sir, but the doctor
has ordered otherwise.


430
0:25:50,336 --> 0:25:54,965
Well Doctor's orders can be a bit
annoying at times.


431
0:25:54,965 --> 0:25:58,16
Dr McCoy is under the impression
you need a little guidance.


432
0:25:58,16 --> 0:26:2,405
That maybe you're being a bit too hard on
yourself about this incident on the planet.


433
0:26:2,405 --> 0:26:5,421
I'm trying to learn from
my mistakes, sir.


434
0:26:5,421 --> 0:26:8,185
That was your order.


435
0:26:8,185 --> 0:26:11,197
Peter, that was advice
not an order.


436
0:26:11,197 --> 0:26:16,49
You might try listening to me a little bit.
It might be easier for you if you just relax.


437
0:26:16,49 --> 0:26:23,641
Could you just please, sit down?


438
0:26:23,641 --> 0:26:26,724
Lt Chekov thinks I'm over-analysing.


439
0:26:26,724 --> 0:26:28,705
You are.


440
0:26:28,705 --> 0:26:33,333
And i know this because it's what
another Ensign Kirk used to do.


441
0:26:33,333 --> 0:26:35,711
Listen, your distraction on the planet...


442
0:26:35,711 --> 0:26:37,376
Perfectly normal.


443
0:26:37,376 --> 0:26:38,759
Your wounds...


444
0:26:38,759 --> 0:26:40,954
... very raw.


445
0:26:40,954 --> 0:26:45,809
But there's no way he would want
you to risk your life for his memory.


446
0:26:45,809 --> 0:26:47,594
PETER:
No, sir. He wouldn't.


447
0:26:47,594 --> 0:26:49,78
[KIRK]
Then don't.


448
0:26:49,78 --> 0:26:52,771
More than anybody else on this ship
I know that you came here to be with him.


449
0:26:52,771 --> 0:26:54,921
And for no other reason.


450
0:26:54,921 --> 0:26:57,457
Now that he's gone...


451
0:26:57,457 --> 0:26:59,175
...you feel alone


452
0:26:59,175 --> 0:27:2,958
Really alone.


453
0:27:2,958 --> 0:27:9,778
Peter, you're not alone.
Nobody on this ship is alone.


454
0:27:9,778 --> 0:27:12,978
And you have a duty to honour his memory.


455
0:27:12,978 --> 0:27:16,284
Honour it by living.


456
0:27:16,284 --> 0:27:22,489
Please don't let his loss be the
weight that pulls you down.


457
0:27:22,489 --> 0:27:24,903
Is that what you would do?


458
0:27:24,903 --> 0:27:42,468
If you lost someone you loved so much?


459
0:27:42,468 --> 0:27:52,932
[KIRK]
It's what I've done.


460
0:27:52,932 --> 0:27:55,966
I'd like to return to duty, sir.
But the doctor...


461
0:27:55,966 --> 0:27:57,746
Yes, the doctor.


462
0:27:57,746 --> 0:28:2,225
What exactly did McCoy
have to say to you?


463
0:28:2,225 --> 0:28:7,858
To take advantage of the downtime.


464
0:28:7,858 --> 0:28:35,379
Peter.... That's exactly what
you should do.


465
0:28:35,379 --> 0:28:36,893
[VORAL]
Alersa...


466
0:28:36,893 --> 0:28:38,611
[ALERSA]
Don't waste my time, Voral.


467
0:28:38,611 --> 0:28:42,43
If sensors aren't restored I expect
for you to be working on them.


468
0:28:42,43 --> 0:28:49,698
[VORAL]
Alersa, my apologies. My report: I-I've restored
some circuits, but not all. With time--


469
0:28:49,698 --> 0:28:52,212
[ALERSA]
Time?


470
0:28:52,212 --> 0:28:55,8
How much time, Voral?


471
0:28:55,8 --> 0:28:57,783
The time it takes to bandage a wound?


472
0:28:57,783 --> 0:29:2,355
[VORAL]
I don't know m'lady. We've never
done battle with such a ship as theirs.


473
0:29:2,355 --> 0:29:4,294
They know more about certain systems.


474
0:29:4,294 --> 0:29:7,461
[ALERSA]
But... they don't know me, yet.


475
0:29:7,461 --> 0:29:10,53
And you do.


476
0:29:10,53 --> 0:29:13,286
Will you fail me? You know
the consequences.


477
0:29:13,286 --> 0:29:14,468
[VORAL]
Yes, m'lady.


478
0:29:14,468 --> 0:29:15,839
[ALERSA]
Yes, you'll fail me?!


479
0:29:15,839 --> 0:29:17,8
[VORAL]
N-no. I'll restore the sensors.


480
0:29:17,8 --> 0:29:18,175
[ALERSA]
Immediately?


481
0:29:18,175 --> 0:29:19,677
[VORAL]
You have my word...


482
0:29:19,677 --> 0:29:23,795
...and my heart.


483
0:29:23,795 --> 0:29:25,45
[ALERSA]
Of course, I do.


484
0:29:25,45 --> 0:29:36,496
[laughter]


485
0:29:36,496 --> 0:29:41,968
[PETER]
Do you think the Captain has someone
in mind to replace Dickerson?


486
0:29:41,968 --> 0:29:45,595
[SENTELL]
I think you should concentrate more on
getting your sea legs under you...


487
0:29:45,595 --> 0:29:48,804
Before vying for department chief.


488
0:29:48,804 --> 0:29:50,733
You have a knack for this stuff.


489
0:29:50,733 --> 0:29:54,991
Scotty, would be eager to
shanghai you for extra work


490
0:29:54,991 --> 0:30:14,904
We've decrypted the Eagle log data.


491
0:30:14,904 --> 0:30:20,77
[EAGLE CAPTAIN]
Captain's Log, Stardate 813.2


492
0:30:20,77 --> 0:30:28,14
An imperfection in our dilithium crystals
has caused an engine imbalance.


493
0:30:28,14 --> 0:30:34,229
It's created a wormhole and
sent us across the quadrant. 


494
0:30:34,229 --> 0:30:38,51
Long range communications are down. 


495
0:30:38,51 --> 0:30:43,346
We have received an answer
to our distress call...


496
0:30:43,346 --> 0:30:47,627
from a nearby race known as the Meska. 


497
0:30:47,627 --> 0:30:55,667
They've sent a ship
[explosion]
-- they sent a ship to help.


498
0:30:55,667 --> 0:30:58,93
Captain's Log: Supplemental.


499
0:30:58,93 --> 0:31:3,65
The Meskan! The Doctor warned me!


500
0:31:3,65 --> 0:31:6,847
... Must attempt self-destruct!


501
0:31:6,847 --> 0:31:12,683
Last resort! Take as many of them
with us as we can!


502
0:31:12,683 --> 0:31:15,392
[EAGLE SCIENCE OFFICER]
No!


503
0:31:15,392 --> 0:31:40,797
[Alersa cackles]


504
0:31:40,797 --> 0:31:43,542
[McCOY]
Maybe the Doctor wasn't affected.


505
0:31:43,542 --> 0:31:47,493
[KIRK]
The Captain obviously was.
Alersa affected his mind.


506
0:31:47,493 --> 0:31:51,984
She made him do things. Give orders
he otherwise wouldn't have.


507
0:31:51,984 --> 0:31:54,104
That crew was bound to follow.


508
0:31:54,104 --> 0:31:57,234
[KYRIL]
My wife suffered the same fate.


509
0:31:57,234 --> 0:32:0,847
She was a captain in our fleet.


510
0:32:0,847 --> 0:32:2,597
Three years ago...


511
0:32:2,597 --> 0:32:5,106
Alersa captured her...


512
0:32:5,106 --> 0:32:9,989
Twisted her mind.
Used her against us all.


513
0:32:9,989 --> 0:32:14,428
At Alersa's order, Shati killed my
commander and destroyed his vessel.


514
0:32:14,428 --> 0:32:22,164
To avoid further carnage...
I had to give the order to--


515
0:32:22,164 --> 0:32:27,442
My wife's death was at my OWN hands.


516
0:32:27,442 --> 0:32:31,401
Alersa did more than deprive
Shati of her identity, Captain.


517
0:32:31,401 --> 0:32:35,694
She stole from me my life.


518
0:32:35,694 --> 0:32:38,156
When I thought you Meskan...


519
0:32:38,156 --> 0:32:42,214
I thought my fate the same as Shati's...


520
0:32:42,214 --> 0:32:43,728
I owe you an apology.


521
0:32:43,728 --> 0:32:46,794
KIRK:
No. We owe you.


522
0:32:46,794 --> 0:32:51,564
For allowing our technology to be stolen
and used against you in the first place.


523
0:32:51,564 --> 0:32:52,877
Options, Mr Scott?


524
0:32:52,877 --> 0:32:57,94
[SCOTTY]
Damn few. That blasted armour
is a rodinium derivative alloy,


525
0:32:57,94 --> 0:32:59,75
protecting her most sensitive areas.


526
0:32:59,75 --> 0:33:2,266
[SPOCK]
Scans of the armour's characteristics
indicate a large fleet


527
0:33:2,266 --> 0:33:3,988
moving toward the Peshan homeworld.


528
0:33:3,988 --> 0:33:5,934
[KYRIL]
Captain, you must stop them.


529
0:33:5,934 --> 0:33:8,515
[KIRK]
We can't engage an entire fleet.


530
0:33:8,515 --> 0:33:12,255
We'd be killing thousands.


531
0:33:12,255 --> 0:33:15,228
We've got to take the Eagle back.
Kill the snake at it's head.


532
0:33:15,228 --> 0:33:17,396
While its body devours my people?


533
0:33:17,396 --> 0:33:20,342
[SPOCK]
There may be a way to stop
both Alersa and her fleet.


534
0:33:20,342 --> 0:33:24,72
A review of the Eagle's logs indicate this area
of space is uncommonly susceptible


535
0:33:24,72 --> 0:33:28,655
to subspace disruption.


536
0:33:28,655 --> 0:33:31,202
Local subspace disequilibrium.


537
0:33:31,202 --> 0:33:35,999
Were the Eagle's engine output modified,
it would disrupt subspace in this area for some time,


538
0:33:35,999 --> 0:33:39,141
rendering faster than light travel impossible.


539
0:33:39,141 --> 0:33:41,972
They're not going to voluntarily
modify their engines.


540
0:33:41,972 --> 0:33:43,618
[CHEKOV]
It would take a saboteur.


541
0:33:43,618 --> 0:33:45,106
[McCOY]
Wait a minute...


542
0:33:45,106 --> 0:33:47,78
"This area" includes where, exactly?


543
0:33:47,78 --> 0:33:51,132
[SPOCK]
We cannot know the location of
every Meskan hybrid starship.


544
0:33:51,132 --> 0:33:55,31
To be effective the disruption must
encompass BOTH star systems.


545
0:33:55,31 --> 0:33:56,688
[McCOY]
My god, Jim...


546
0:33:56,688 --> 0:33:58,97
That would isolate them totally.


547
0:33:58,97 --> 0:34:2,858
What if their colony worlds
can't survive without support?


548
0:34:2,858 --> 0:34:5,348
Millions could die. On both sides.


549
0:34:5,348 --> 0:34:6,735
[KIRK]
Mr Spock...


550
0:34:6,735 --> 0:34:9,662
How long would this disruption last?


551
0:34:9,662 --> 0:34:10,796
Unknown.


552
0:34:10,796 --> 0:34:13,759
[KYRIL]
Many of our colonies would
find life difficult for a time...


553
0:34:13,759 --> 0:34:17,154
But this would keep my homeworld safe.


554
0:34:17,154 --> 0:34:18,849
[McCOY]
And what of the Meskan?


555
0:34:18,849 --> 0:34:20,36
Who speaks for them?


556
0:34:20,36 --> 0:34:22,836
They can't all support this war.


557
0:34:22,836 --> 0:34:25,203
Those who don't die along with those who do?


558
0:34:25,203 --> 0:34:28,261
[KYRIL]
Such is the unfortunate
price of warfare, Doctor.


559
0:34:28,261 --> 0:34:29,618
WE are not the aggressors.


560
0:34:29,618 --> 0:34:32,555
[McCOY]
Yeah, well ask the dead if they give
a damn who the aggressors are.


561
0:34:32,555 --> 0:34:34,6
[KYRIL]
Fewer would die this way.


562
0:34:34,6 --> 0:34:37,898
[MCCOY]
You don't know that. You CAN'T know that.


563
0:34:37,898 --> 0:34:41,693
Jim, we can't do this.


564
0:34:41,693 --> 0:34:43,661
[KIRK]
I agree with the Doctor.


565
0:34:43,661 --> 0:34:47,493
We'd be making a decision that would not
only affect this generation


566
0:34:47,493 --> 0:34:50,4
...but countless generations to come.


567
0:34:50,4 --> 0:34:52,461
We can't doom two cultures like this.


568
0:34:52,461 --> 0:34:58,257
[KYRIL]
Captain, you argue for a posterity that
won't exist should we die today!


569
0:34:58,257 --> 0:35:0,141
Commander...


570
0:35:0,141 --> 0:35:2,906
This isn't the answer.


571
0:35:2,906 --> 0:35:5,85
[bosun whistle]


572
0:35:5,85 --> 0:35:6,239
Kirk here.


573
0:35:6,239 --> 0:35:8,73
[XON]
Sensors have been restored, Captain.


574
0:35:8,73 --> 0:35:9,617
But the Eagle is already gone.


575
0:35:9,617 --> 0:35:11,99
[KIRK]
Find them.
All hands, battlestations.


576
0:35:11,99 --> 0:35:17,305
[alert klaxon]


577
0:35:17,305 --> 0:35:22,43
[KIRK] Captain's Log: Stardate 7232.8
Commander Kyril has contacted his government.


578
0:35:22,43 --> 0:35:25,286
They have approved the subspace
destabilisation plan.


579
0:35:25,286 --> 0:35:27,321
That makes my decision no easier.


580
0:35:27,321 --> 0:35:31,79
What's left of the Peshan forces have
pulled back to defend their home-world
from an attacking Meskan fleet


581
0:35:31,79 --> 0:35:33,316
that I must stop.


582
0:35:33,316 --> 0:35:37,59
If necessary, with the drastic
measure Spock has suggested.


583
0:35:37,59 --> 0:35:39,608
[KIRK]
She's alone again. Target the Eagle.


584
0:35:39,608 --> 0:35:40,65
[CHEKOV]
Aye, sir.


585
0:35:40,65 --> 0:35:42,29
[SPOCK]
Two vessels, incoming.


586
0:35:42,29 --> 0:35:43,552
Hybrid Meskan starships.


587
0:35:43,552 --> 0:35:49,915
Time to intercept:
Three point two minutes


588
0:35:49,915 --> 0:35:52,603
[KYRIL]
Our sixth fleet...


589
0:35:52,603 --> 0:35:55,797
Seventy-five hundred souls...


590
0:35:55,797 --> 0:36:0,239
They're gone.


591
0:36:0,239 --> 0:36:3,837
Now nothing stands between
her and my planet.


592
0:36:3,837 --> 0:36:5,55
We've got to get through that armour.


593
0:36:5,55 --> 0:36:9,406
Keptin, it may be possible to strengthen
our phasers enough to burn through


594
0:36:9,406 --> 0:36:12,84
Ve could reroute our power
directly through the varp engines.


595
0:36:12,84 --> 0:36:14,253
[SCOTTY]
Our relays really aren't designed
to withstand that.


596
0:36:14,253 --> 0:36:15,394
[KIRK]
Bypass them.


597
0:36:15,394 --> 0:36:18,489
Aye. But the firing circuits will
only hold for a minute or two.


598
0:36:18,489 --> 0:36:21,272
A minute or two will get her
attention, Mr Scott.


599
0:36:21,272 --> 0:36:25,573
Aye, sir.


600
0:36:25,573 --> 0:36:27,729
Mr Spock, this plan...


601
0:36:27,729 --> 0:36:30,25
How certain are you
this thing's going to work?


602
0:36:30,25 --> 0:36:32,437
The problem is not
execution but timing.


603
0:36:32,437 --> 0:36:35,791
In order for the Enterprise to
escape the subsequent dead zone


604
0:36:35,791 --> 0:36:40,337
The engine imbalance which created
the wormhole and brought the Eagle to
this system must be duplicated.


605
0:36:40,337 --> 0:36:43,972
And only moments before setting off
the susbspace disruption.


606
0:36:43,972 --> 0:36:47,643
Kyril? Are you sure about this?
Are your people sure?


607
0:36:47,643 --> 0:36:49,478
I'm not.


608
0:36:49,478 --> 0:36:52,33
But it's a price they
are willing to pay.


609
0:36:52,33 --> 0:36:56,916
There will at least be peace if neither
side can visit war on the enemy.


610
0:36:56,916 --> 0:37:0,93
If we are to be trapped together forever...


611
0:37:0,93 --> 0:37:3,118
Maybe it's a just accounting for
our respective crimes.


612
0:37:3,118 --> 0:37:5,84
[KIRK]
I can send you home in a shuttle.
You'll reach your colony in--


613
0:37:5,84 --> 0:37:8,197
[KYRIL]
Captain, I was an astrophysicist.


614
0:37:8,197 --> 0:37:10,306
If my people are to be lost to
space-normal travel...


615
0:37:10,306 --> 0:37:14,849
someone needs to be outside the
phenomena, looking for a solution.


616
0:37:14,849 --> 0:37:18,265
And I have no family to return to.


617
0:37:18,265 --> 0:37:21,276
[KIRK]
What adjustments do i need to make
to the Eagle's engines?


618
0:37:21,276 --> 0:37:26,124
Captain, I am the logical choice to beam
over to the Eagle and affect the modifications.


619
0:37:26,124 --> 0:37:28,166
Alersa's abilities may
be a threat to you,


620
0:37:28,166 --> 0:37:29,881
while my Vulcan mental disciplines--


621
0:37:29,881 --> 0:37:31,342
[KIRK]
Are needed here.


622
0:37:31,342 --> 0:37:35,88
That woman murdered a starship
captain and killed his crew.


623
0:37:35,88 --> 0:37:36,595
I'm going, Spock.


624
0:37:36,595 --> 0:37:38,814
[SPOCK]
It will take two saboteurs.


625
0:37:38,814 --> 0:37:41,165
Someone must route power
to the proper circuits


626
0:37:41,165 --> 0:37:43,825
while the other modifies the plasma flow.


627
0:37:43,825 --> 0:37:45,281
[KIRK]
Peter?


628
0:37:45,281 --> 0:37:46,529
[PETER]
Yes, sir?


629
0:37:46,529 --> 0:37:51,825
I understand that you've been polishing
your engineering skills.


630
0:37:51,825 --> 0:38:1,647
Good. Because you're coming with me.


631
0:38:1,647 --> 0:38:5,486
[ANDOCH]
They're cruising at Warp 8,
heading deep into our system.


632
0:38:5,486 --> 0:38:8,312
[ALERSA]
Increase speed to match.


633
0:38:8,312 --> 0:38:11,638
[ANDOCH]
The drain to the engines will limit disruptor
batteries and our structural integrity.


634
0:38:11,638 --> 0:38:13,115
ANDOCH!


635
0:38:13,115 --> 0:38:16,468
Intercept the Enterprise.


636
0:38:16,468 --> 0:38:21,255
Everything I have worked to achieve
will not be destroyed.


637
0:38:21,255 --> 0:38:25,109
You know why? Do you?


638
0:38:25,109 --> 0:38:39,97
Because you will not let that happen.


639
0:38:39,97 --> 0:38:41,391
[PETER]
Mr Scott?


640
0:38:41,391 --> 0:38:44,278
Request permission to assist
with the warp phasers.


641
0:38:44,278 --> 0:38:46,891
"Warp phasers"? Is that what
we're calling 'em now?


642
0:38:46,891 --> 0:38:49,406
They will be powered
by the warp engines, sir.


643
0:38:49,406 --> 0:38:51,284
Aye.


644
0:38:51,284 --> 0:38:53,173
You lads finish these bypasses.


645
0:38:53,173 --> 0:39:0,508
I gotta get back to
ruining my engines.


646
0:39:0,508 --> 0:39:4,919
[KYLE]
Imbalancing the engines puts the
lives of everyone onboard at risk.


647
0:39:4,919 --> 0:39:7,393
Nobody knows that
better than Scotty.


648
0:39:7,393 --> 0:39:10,79
[PETER]
What if it doesn't work and
there is no wormhole?


649
0:39:10,79 --> 0:39:13,506
[KYLE]
We're sending out a warp buoy
ahead of the destabilisation wave.


650
0:39:13,506 --> 0:39:15,559
Starfleet will be briefed
in three weeks.


651
0:39:15,559 --> 0:39:17,18
[PETER]
And we'll be trapped here?


652
0:39:17,18 --> 0:39:19,53
[KYLE]
Not to worry, Ensign...


653
0:39:19,53 --> 0:39:25,476
There's a Class 'M' planet only
thirteen years away at impulse.


654
0:39:25,476 --> 0:39:27,356
Mr Chekov, It's the Eagle we want.


655
0:39:27,356 --> 0:39:28,473
Even the odds.


656
0:39:28,473 --> 0:39:34,622
Aye, sir


657
0:39:34,622 --> 0:39:42,102
[SPOCK]
Eagle is returning fire.
All weapon banks.


658
0:39:42,102 --> 0:39:45,376
[UHURA]
Casualty reports.


659
0:39:45,376 --> 0:39:48,21
Multiple injuries, Captain.


660
0:39:48,21 --> 0:39:52,581
Bridge to Kyle.


661
0:39:52,581 --> 0:39:55,743
Captain, I should really
run a diagnostic--


662
0:39:55,743 --> 0:39:57,255
We need those phasers now!


663
0:39:57,255 --> 0:39:59,838
[KYLE]
These circuits weren't meant
for this. They're going to blow.


664
0:39:59,838 --> 0:40:3,736
Kyle, throw the switch!


665
0:40:3,736 --> 0:40:5,903
[CHEKOV]
Keptin! Phasers online!


666
0:40:5,903 --> 0:40:25,681
Fire.


667
0:40:25,681 --> 0:40:27,41
[ANDOCH]
Shields and weapons offline.


668
0:40:27,41 --> 0:40:30,393
[ALERSA]
Hide them from, Kirk --
and jam their sensors!


669
0:40:30,393 --> 0:40:37,417
And get those weapons back!


670
0:40:37,417 --> 0:40:38,666
[CHEKOV]
Chot!


671
0:40:38,666 --> 0:40:41,436
Phasers -- torpedoes -- The
whole weapons sub-system.


672
0:40:41,436 --> 0:40:43,293
Gone.


673
0:40:43,293 --> 0:40:45,626
[KIRK}
Kyle, get those weapons back online.


674
0:40:45,626 --> 0:40:48,414
[KYLE]
Aye, sir.


675
0:40:48,414 --> 0:40:51,124
KIRK:
Uhura, get me the Eagle.


676
0:40:51,124 --> 0:40:53,43
Onscreen.


677
0:40:53,43 --> 0:40:57,408
Alersa. I think its time we
meet face to face.


678
0:40:57,408 --> 0:40:59,892
We're prepared to beam you
aboard the Enterprise.


679
0:40:59,892 --> 0:41:1,439
[ALERSA]
Captain Kirk...


680
0:41:1,439 --> 0:41:5,931
I had no idea what a developed sense
of humour you Starfleet men have.


681
0:41:5,931 --> 0:41:8,43
Well we've flexed our muscles...


682
0:41:8,43 --> 0:41:9,609
We've tested each other.


683
0:41:9,609 --> 0:41:13,369
We've looked and found our
strengths and weaknesses.


684
0:41:13,369 --> 0:41:14,893
Let's talk.


685
0:41:14,893 --> 0:41:18,473
I'm sure we can come to some
sort of understanding.


686
0:41:18,473 --> 0:41:23,223
So now it's my turn to slit this
pretty throat for you?


687
0:41:23,223 --> 0:41:24,392
[KIRK]
No.


688
0:41:24,392 --> 0:41:26,399
I'll come to you.


689
0:41:26,399 --> 0:41:30,29
This way you will get a first hand look
at the operation of our transporters.


690
0:41:30,29 --> 0:41:32,36
Captain Kirk...


691
0:41:32,36 --> 0:41:38,2
You become more interesting
with each passing moment.


692
0:41:38,2 --> 0:41:44,365
Come to me.


693
0:41:44,365 --> 0:41:48,205
[SENTELL]
Transporter controls have been rewired so
we can beam both signals in at the same time...


694
0:41:48,205 --> 0:41:50,119
The second signal won't be detected.


695
0:41:50,119 --> 0:41:53,194
We've rigged it for maximum speed transport,
to limit time shields are down.


696
0:41:53,194 --> 0:41:55,969
[KIRK]
You have the co-ordinates to beam
Ensign Kirk to the Jefferies tube.


697
0:41:55,969 --> 0:41:57,24
[SENTELL]
Aye, sir.


698
0:41:57,24 --> 0:42:0,586
MCCOY:
Keep a lock on those subcutaneous
transponders at all times.


699
0:42:0,586 --> 0:42:3,4
And you...


700
0:42:3,4 --> 0:42:7,775
Try not dig this one out with a spoon.


701
0:42:7,775 --> 0:42:10,217
[KIRK]
Energise.


702
0:42:10,217 --> 0:42:19,499
[SENTELL]
Energising.


703
0:42:19,499 --> 0:42:22,28
[McCOY]
Two Kirks...


704
0:42:22,28 --> 0:42:26,2
God must be punishing me.


705
0:42:26,2 --> 0:42:42,462
[ANDOCH]
If we were smart we'd kill him now.


706
0:42:42,462 --> 0:42:43,708
[communicator chirp]


707
0:42:43,708 --> 0:42:45,743
[ALERSA]
What's the delay?


708
0:42:45,743 --> 0:42:48,236
[ANDOCH]
He's aboard m'lady, we'll take
him to the briefing room--


709
0:42:48,236 --> 0:42:50,275
[ALERSA]
My quarters, Andoch.


710
0:42:50,275 --> 0:42:51,612
[ANDOCH]
I thought that-- 


711
0:42:51,612 --> 0:42:54,534
[ALERSA]
What have I told you about thinking?


712
0:42:54,534 --> 0:43:15,981
Don't think. JUST DO as I say.


713
0:43:15,981 --> 0:43:18,67
[SENTELL]
No change, Mr Spock.


714
0:43:18,67 --> 0:43:21,713
We can't maintain a lock
on the Captain's transponder.


715
0:43:21,713 --> 0:43:24,532
We've done everything we
can to boost the signal.


716
0:43:24,532 --> 0:43:26,98
[SPOCK]
The armour is interfering
with the transmission


717
0:43:26,98 --> 0:43:39,409
[McCOY]
What about, Peter?


718
0:43:39,409 --> 0:43:44,271
[SENTELL]
I have a lock on Ensign Kirk.
He's in a less protected section.


719
0:43:44,271 --> 0:43:48,397
Mr Spock, if we can reach the Captain via
communicator to establish his general position


720
0:43:48,397 --> 0:43:50,517
...and keep the shields
down 75% longer.


721
0:43:50,517 --> 0:43:54,602
That would leave the Enterprise open to heavy
attack should the Eagle restore her weapons.


722
0:43:54,602 --> 0:43:56,818
Spock, we are not
leaving Jim behind.


723
0:43:56,818 --> 0:44:7,45
If we cannot locate him, Doctor
we may not have a choice.


724
0:44:7,45 --> 0:44:9,896
[ALERSA]
Captain Kirk...


725
0:44:9,896 --> 0:44:14,24
Well, in person at last.


726
0:44:14,24 --> 0:44:16,995
Are you truly here to talk?


727
0:44:16,995 --> 0:44:20,102
Or are you secretly
planning to kill me?


728
0:44:20,102 --> 0:44:22,779
[KIRK]
Well telling you would take away
half the challenge, wouldn't it?


729
0:44:22,779 --> 0:44:26,398
Ohhhh... We are two of a kind.


730
0:44:26,398 --> 0:44:31,211
Why don't we just start with a
tour of your modifications.


731
0:44:31,211 --> 0:44:33,797
I have something else in mind.


732
0:44:33,797 --> 0:44:34,9
[ANDOCH]
Alersa...


733
0:44:34,9 --> 0:44:36,606
Do not question me, Andoch.


734
0:44:36,606 --> 0:44:48,407
Or your next visit to these quarters
will be far less pleasant than usual.


735
0:44:48,407 --> 0:45:2,1
[KIRK]
No guards. I'm flattered.


736
0:45:2,1 --> 0:45:14,527
[ALERSA]
You don't strike me as the type of man
who would hurt a defenceless lady.


737
0:45:14,527 --> 0:45:19,805
And you don't strike
me as a lady...


738
0:45:19,805 --> 0:45:21,837
...who's defenceless.


739
0:45:21,837 --> 0:45:25,5
You are right about one thing...


740
0:45:25,5 --> 0:45:33,59
I'm anything but defenceless.


741
0:45:33,59 --> 0:45:36,944
[ALERSA]
You see we are the same... don't you?


742
0:45:36,944 --> 0:45:40,692
Yes, we are...


743
0:45:40,692 --> 0:45:43,236
But not exactly.


744
0:45:43,236 --> 0:45:46,804
I'm glad you noticed, Captain.


745
0:45:46,804 --> 0:45:54,545
Call me, Jim.


746
0:45:54,545 --> 0:45:57,277
Call me, Alersa.


747
0:45:57,277 --> 0:46:2,218
Jim, you were going to
tell me why you're here.


748
0:46:2,218 --> 0:46:4,99
Well...


749
0:46:4,99 --> 0:46:5,703
I'd like too.


750
0:46:5,703 --> 0:46:9,563
[ALERSA]
Yes...


751
0:46:9,563 --> 0:46:11,618
I... I can't.


752
0:46:11,618 --> 0:46:13,41
You can..


753
0:46:13,41 --> 0:46:15,85
Jim....


754
0:46:15,85 --> 0:46:19,421
You trusted me the
moment we met.


755
0:46:19,421 --> 0:46:21,12
[KIRK]
I trusted you.


756
0:46:21,12 --> 0:46:38,189
[ALERSA]
Yes.


757
0:46:38,189 --> 0:46:40,73
[communicator chirp]


758
0:46:40,73 --> 0:46:42,727
[PETER]
Modifications complete, Mr Spock.


759
0:46:42,727 --> 0:46:46,879
Acknowledged. Activate at Mr Sentell's
signal for transporter coordination


760
0:46:46,879 --> 0:46:49,865
[McCOY]
Peter, the Captain's
transponder isn't working.


761
0:46:49,865 --> 0:46:56,102
Mr Spock, Standby. I can set
this to trigger remotely.


762
0:46:56,102 --> 0:47:5,666
I'm going to find
the Captain.


763
0:47:5,666 --> 0:47:8,877
[ALERSA]
Jim...


764
0:47:8,877 --> 0:47:13,405
Jim, I think it's time for you
to tell me why you're here.


765
0:47:13,405 --> 0:47:19,937
[KIRK]
Your armour modifications would take
us years to learn about from scans.


766
0:47:19,937 --> 0:47:25,851
I came to get the information
for Starfleet.


767
0:47:25,851 --> 0:47:27,961
[ALERSA]
Jim...


768
0:47:27,961 --> 0:47:33,974
That would have been
very, very, very naughty.


769
0:47:33,974 --> 0:47:37,85
You should beg forgiveness
shouldn't you?


770
0:47:37,85 --> 0:47:38,448
[KIRK]
I should.


771
0:47:38,448 --> 0:47:41,189
[ALERSA]
Yes...


772
0:47:41,189 --> 0:47:45,328
[KIRK]
The transporter. You want it.


773
0:47:45,328 --> 0:47:49,721
I could show you how to fix it.


774
0:47:49,721 --> 0:47:52,377
Show me.


775
0:47:52,377 --> 0:47:55,614
Show me how to
have more power.


776
0:47:55,614 --> 0:47:58,837
... and all will be forgiven.


777
0:47:58,837 --> 0:48:1,79
[KIRK]
Take me to your Engineer.


778
0:48:1,79 --> 0:48:3,167
Yes.


779
0:48:3,167 --> 0:48:7,568
I'll show him.


780
0:48:7,568 --> 0:48:9,711
[ALERSA]
It's alright.


781
0:48:9,711 --> 0:48:13,652
[stuns]


782
0:48:13,652 --> 0:48:15,878
[ALERSA]
Impossible...


783
0:48:15,878 --> 0:48:17,515
You couldn't have.


784
0:48:17,515 --> 0:48:22,448
Oh, I wouldn't have.
Not with you.


785
0:48:22,448 --> 0:48:27,945
[stuns]


786
0:48:27,945 --> 0:48:30,955
[PETER]
Somehow I knew I'd find you here.


787
0:48:30,955 --> 0:48:32,29
What happened?


788
0:48:32,29 --> 0:48:33,64
]KIRK]
Exhaustion.
What are you doing here?


789
0:48:33,64 --> 0:48:35,401
There's no signal from
your transponder.


790
0:48:35,401 --> 0:48:37,995
I've set the disruption to
trigger from remote.


791
0:48:37,995 --> 0:48:47,608
[KIRK]
Inside.


792
0:48:47,608 --> 0:48:50,78
[SENTELL]
Mr Spock, we've lost
both signals now.


793
0:48:50,78 --> 0:48:55,298
[XON]
They've restored weapons and
are charging all ports.


794
0:48:55,298 --> 0:48:58,968
[SCOTTY]
The imbalance will begin at warp one
but if they fire their disruptors.


795
0:48:58,968 --> 0:49:3,411
Take evasive action.


796
0:49:3,411 --> 0:49:5,914
The Eagle's engines are
whining like a toy...


797
0:49:5,914 --> 0:49:8,247
We've got less than 50 seconds.


798
0:49:8,247 --> 0:49:9,724
[bosun whistle]


799
0:49:9,724 --> 0:49:12,493
[KIRK]
Enterprise, two to beam out.
Deck 5. Section 7.


800
0:49:12,493 --> 0:49:14,588
[SPOCK]
Transporter room.
Prepare to energise.


801
0:49:14,588 --> 0:49:16,12
Lower the shields.


802
0:49:16,12 --> 0:49:17,15
Mr Sentell...


803
0:49:17,15 --> 0:49:30,85
You have 42.9 seconds.


804
0:49:30,85 --> 0:49:33,441
[UHURA]
We've got them, Mr Spock.


805
0:49:33,441 --> 0:49:35,81
[CHEKOV]
Shields up.


806
0:49:35,81 --> 0:49:36,971
Launch the warp buoy, Mr Chekov.


807
0:49:36,971 --> 0:49:41,259
Mr Sulu, warp one.


808
0:49:41,259 --> 0:49:50,97
[beeping]


809
0:49:50,97 --> 0:50:26,302
[ALERSA]
Noooooooooo!


810
0:50:26,302 --> 0:50:28,666
[SPOCK]
Federation Space, Captain.


811
0:50:28,666 --> 0:50:31,89
[SULU]
Exactly, three parsecs
from Starbase seven.


812
0:50:31,89 --> 0:50:34,884
[SPOCK]
I thought we might need the
benefit of their repair facilities.


813
0:50:34,884 --> 0:50:37,749
[KYRIL]
Did you kill her?


814
0:50:37,749 --> 0:50:39,893
[KIRK]
She's stranded, Commander.


815
0:50:39,893 --> 0:50:44,774
Powerless.


816
0:50:44,774 --> 0:50:47,88
I'd call that justice.


817
0:50:47,88 --> 0:50:51,817
[KYRIL]
A shallow justice, Captain.


818
0:50:51,817 --> 0:50:55,9
[KIRK] Captain's Log: Stardate 7233.1


819
0:50:55,9 --> 0:50:57,198
Repairs are almost complete.


820
0:50:57,198 --> 0:51:0,818
Starfleet is gathering a taskforce which
will be heading for Peshan Space.


821
0:51:0,818 --> 0:51:5,388
Probes detect the dead zone blanketing
the entirety of the Peshan and Meskan systems.


822
0:51:5,388 --> 0:51:8,2
For how long we can't be sure.


823
0:51:8,2 --> 0:51:11,382
[door buzzer]


824
0:51:11,382 --> 0:51:15,399
[KIRK]
Come.


825
0:51:15,399 --> 0:51:19,727
[CHEKOV]
You vanted to see me, sir.


826
0:51:19,727 --> 0:51:22,504
Yes, I did.


827
0:51:22,504 --> 0:51:26,986
Mr Chekov, your idea to channel the
phasers through the main warp engines.


828
0:51:26,986 --> 0:51:30,45
Do you realise it destroyed the
entire weapons sub-systems.


829
0:51:30,45 --> 0:51:32,142
[CHEKOV]
Yes, sir, I...


830
0:51:32,142 --> 0:51:33,853
I'm aware of that.


831
0:51:33,853 --> 0:51:35,192
I'm sorry, sir.


832
0:51:35,192 --> 0:51:37,873
[KIRK]
You saved the ship.


833
0:51:37,873 --> 0:51:39,741
You saved my life
on the planet.


834
0:51:39,741 --> 0:51:42,756
Keptin, I vas only doing vhat
any good officer vould do.


835
0:51:42,756 --> 0:51:47,829
Mr Chekov, you consistently see dangers to this
ship and this crew long before the rest of us do.


836
0:51:47,829 --> 0:51:50,371
You're at the navigation station, you...


837
0:51:50,371 --> 0:51:53,686
Strategise and Analyse.


838
0:51:53,686 --> 0:51:56,958
See things the rest of
us never dream of.


839
0:51:56,958 --> 0:51:59,754
You have a fatalistic
heart, Mr Chekov.


840
0:51:59,754 --> 0:52:9,429
Sir, I'm sorry i have
disappointed you.


841
0:52:9,429 --> 0:52:15,846
I'm going to make you
Chief of Security.


842
0:52:15,846 --> 0:52:19,22
In addition to your
duties as navigator.


843
0:52:19,22 --> 0:52:20,829
Thank you, sir.


844
0:52:20,829 --> 0:52:25,902
You realise of course this will put
Mr Kirk under your direct command.


845
0:52:25,902 --> 0:52:29,522
I understand you've already
taken him under your wing.


846
0:52:29,522 --> 0:52:32,298
N-not that I'm
aware of, sir.


847
0:52:32,298 --> 0:52:33,612
[KIRK]
Well...


848
0:52:33,612 --> 0:52:38,653
He's going to need a mentor and I can't
think of anyone more suited to the task.


849
0:52:38,653 --> 0:52:40,467
You know how he is...


850
0:52:40,467 --> 0:52:42,511
He's a bit too rash.


851
0:52:42,511 --> 0:52:44,796
Stubborn.


852
0:52:44,796 --> 0:52:48,807
Competitive.


853
0:52:48,807 --> 0:52:54,321
And he's way too hard on himself.


854
0:52:54,321 --> 0:52:58,11
Consensus on this ship is that he
reminds you of somebody else.


855
0:52:58,11 --> 0:52:59,46
[CHEKOV]
Yes...


856
0:52:59,46 --> 0:53:3,431
You.


857
0:53:3,431 --> 0:53:11,538
Keptin.


858
0:53:11,538 --> 0:53:14,144
[KYRIL]
Captain. Gentlemen.


859
0:53:14,144 --> 0:53:17,638
I'm glad we got the chance to say goodbye
before I transport to the Lexington.


860
0:53:17,638 --> 0:53:21,324
My people are safe and I have
all of you to thank for it.


861
0:53:21,324 --> 0:53:23,203
Especially you...


862
0:53:23,203 --> 0:53:25,684
for risking yourself to
Alersa's powerful will.


863
0:53:25,684 --> 0:53:27,748
[McCOY]
Well she'd never
met a Kirk before.


864
0:53:27,748 --> 0:53:29,631
[PETER]
We have will to spare, sir.


865
0:53:29,631 --> 0:53:31,81
[KIRK]
And we managed to
use it together.


866
0:53:31,81 --> 0:53:33,101
[McCOY]
Commander Kyril...


867
0:53:33,101 --> 0:53:35,624
Good luck on finding a
solution to the dead zone.


868
0:53:35,624 --> 0:53:39,891
[SPOCK]
I shall be interested in monitoring
the progress of the taskforce.


869
0:53:39,891 --> 0:53:42,205
[KIRK]
There may be no solution coming.


870
0:53:42,205 --> 0:53:46,219
[KYRIL]
No but it was necessary to
stop the slaughter.


871
0:53:46,219 --> 0:53:50,696
Perhaps now, both sides will be more focused
on the problems the dead zone presents


872
0:53:50,696 --> 0:53:53,661
Rather than on a war that
can no longer be fought.


873
0:53:53,661 --> 0:53:55,197
[KIRK]
Well...


874
0:53:55,197 --> 0:53:58,217
I hope that you see your home
again and that your people prosper.


875
0:53:58,217 --> 0:54:0,281
No matter what their conditions.


876
0:54:0,281 --> 0:54:9,873
[SPOCK]
Lexington signals. They're ready, sir.


877
0:54:9,873 --> 0:54:12,43
[KIRK]
Safe travels, Commander.


878
0:54:12,43 --> 0:54:14,6
And you, Captain.


879
0:54:14,6 --> 0:54:26,258
Energise.


880
0:54:26,258 --> 0:54:28,864
Now there goes one brave man.


881
0:54:28,864 --> 0:54:33,702
The Peshan are a brave people to have embraced a
solution with such complex challenges.


882
0:54:33,702 --> 0:54:35,962
The challenge begins now, Spock.


883
0:54:35,962 --> 0:54:39,996
Where facing life in a world that everyday
presents a new set of challenges.


884
0:54:39,996 --> 0:54:48,25
It's going to take a lot of courage to
work together for the common good.


885
0:54:48,25 --> 0:54:53,629
Courage, gentlemen:
The order of the day.


886
0:54:53,629 --> 0:55:5,691
[music swells]


887
0:55:5,691 --> 0:55:7,35
This is James Cawley.


888
0:55:7,35 --> 0:55:11,998
Stay tuned for exciting scenes
from our next 'Star Trek'


889
0:55:11,998 --> 0:55:17,608
Next Time on Star Trek: Phase II


890
0:55:17,608 --> 0:55:26,202
Reading something ahead, Commander.
Looks to be a nebula.


891
0:55:26,202 --> 0:55:29,37
Should we wake the Captain, sir?


892

I don't understand it...


893
0:55:31,558 --> 0:55:33,5
I have not broken my vow.


894
0:55:33,5 --> 0:55:35,64
What's wrong Isel?


895
0:55:35,64 --> 0:55:36,938
I'm pregnant, Doctor.

That child may pose a threat to this
ship in ways we cannot anticipate

No matter how much Isel,
loves that child.

It was placed inside her
by an unknown alien.


899
0:55:44,683 --> 0:55:46,103
For an unknown reason.

Mother...


901
0:55:47,16 --> 0:55:51,27

PETER:
Something is being beamed
aboard from the alien cylinder.


903
0:55:53,317 --> 0:55:57,46
The alien energy beam is focused on
impulse engine: plasma cooling unit 2

Do you have any idea whether or not
she's connected to that cylinder out there


910
0:56:9,626 --> 0:56:11,677

I didn't mean to hurt you.

It was intoxicating

0:56:24,222 --> 0:56:27,875
CHILD:
Mr Scott is dying.
I have to help him.


914
0:56:27,875 --> 0:56:32,237
SPOCK:
It is an extreme bio-toxin and we
were exposed to a lethal dose


915
0:56:32,237 --> 0:56:35,952
Unless Dr McCoy can
counteract it within 6.2 hours


916
0:56:35,952 --> 0:57:41,139
It will kill us all.
