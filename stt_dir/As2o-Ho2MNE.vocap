###8 Why did you want to be an astronaut?
###14 In the late ’60s I was seven, eight, nine years old, and what was going on in the news
###21 at that time that really excited a seven, eight, nine year old boy was the Space Race.
###26 The “2001: A Space Odyssey,” that science fiction movie came out, and in reality people
###32 were flying Gemini and people were starting to fly Apollo and starting to go to the moon,
###37 and the whole purpose of it, which was clear to everybody, was to put a human being on
###41 the moon by the end of decade. Within the ’60s, and so as a kid growing up, it didn’t
###46 matter where you were, whether you were in Malaysia or Canada or here in Houston, this
###51 is a pretty exciting thing, and it really captured my imagination. I had a National
###56 Geographic big picture of the moon above my bed on the wall and I was watching the exploits.
###62 On July 20, 1969, like so many other people, I sat and looked at a bad, grainy little television
###69 and watched those first steps on the moon and then went outside with my family, but
###73 really alone, looked up at the moon and thought, that’s what I want to do when I grow up;
###80 I’m going to grow up to be something, why don’t I grow up to be that, that is an interesting
###85 thing, that’s a new challenge for humanity. But then when I look around I’m thinking,
###90 I’m a nine year old kid and I’m a Canadian, what are my odds? Not very good. But I thought,
###95 well, up until yesterday people couldn’t even go and walk on the moon and now they
###99 can, so maybe I can, too. I started getting ready that night, what do I need to do next?
###108 And I need to learn to fly and to scuba dive and to stay in shape and other languages and
###114 study in university and all of those things. To become an engineer, a fighter pilot, a
###119 test pilot and all of that, which was fun and fascinating, but also all to help maybe
###125 in the lifelong dream of having a chance to be an astronaut and to follow in the footsteps
###129 of Buzz and Neil. Amazingly enough it worked.
###135 Tell me a little of that story. Tell me about where you grew up.
###141 I was born in Sarnia, Ontario; a small town, it’s where oil was pretty much discovered
###147 in North America. It’s an industrial town right on the Great Lakes, beautiful little
###154 spot, and my father got hired by an airline when I was about seven or eight and then we
###159 moved to a farm closer to Toronto because he was flying for Air Canada based out of
###163 Toronto. I spent my childhood basically in two towns, Sarnia for the first half of it,
###168 starting kindergarten and grade school there, and then Milton, Ontario, near Toronto, living
###173 on a farm for the rest of middle school and for high school. My parents still live on
###179 a farm near Milton, Ontario.
###183 How did that place and those people help make you the person that you are?
###189 I’ve raised three kids, my wife and I have three kids. I’ve observed through direct
###196 contact the adults they are now is partially the product of where they came from and what
###203 we did. With them growing up, but partially how they were wired at birth. There are fundamental
###207 differences, and I’m sure I’m no different than my kids. I am born with whatever I was
###215 born with, what height I’m going to be and what color my eyes are and how my particular
###219 synapses all fire, but I’m also very much the product of the environment; my value system,
###227 the educational system that I went through, the people that I met, the people that inspired
###231 me or the people that oppressed me. I’m very much a product of all of that. So any
###239 successes I’ve had, partially it’s due to genetics, partially it’s due to the people
###244 that have trained me and taught me and shaped me over the years, and I have lots of people
###249 that I could directly thank for helping get me to where I am today. For teaching me something
###255 critical or maybe teaching me something in general that helped me perceive things the
###261 way that I do. I think, if you want to grow up to be an astronaut, growing up as a kid
###268 in southern Ontario is a pretty good place to come from.
###271 Pick up the story from there for me and give me a thumbnail sketch of big steps in your
###276 education and your career that have led you to be here at this point.
###282 I went to a little tiny rural school called Percy W. Merry. I was doing well in school;
###291 I was in grade three or four and skipped one of those grades. Fortunately the Ontario educational
###297 system in the province of Ontario in Canada, had decided that they should have, what at
###302 the time they called “enrichment,” sort of like trying to pick out the kids that were
###305 doing real well, how to challenge them, and how to maybe put them in a different educational
###310 environment so that they could really learn and be challenged. I got into that program
###315 and for three years I was in an enrichment program, really teaching us to think more
###320 critically, more analytically, think on a different scale then just getting these exercises
###325 done in time for this test. I went to two different high schools, and there was two
###332 different tracks, one the high school track to go to the university and one not. At the
###336 time you went to an extra year of high school if you’re going to university, nice preparation
###340 for the course that I decided to follow. I was a ski instructor; there’s a great opportunity
###348 for outdoor activities in Canada and to be able to have the combination of the natural
###357 environment, the physical challenges of downhill skiing and racing. Being a ski instructor,
###361 for me I learned a lot about managing speed and managing energy. I learned to fly as a
###367 teenager; there’s a program in Canada called Air Cadets, it’s sort of like the Civil
###371 Air Patrol in the United States but it’s a little closer to the Canadian air force,
###376 and they teach young Canadians, whether it’s Sea Cadets, Army Cadets or Air Cadets, they
###381 teach them a bunch of technical things, they teach them self-discipline, they give them
###384 levels of responsibility that they might not get otherwise as teenagers, and in my case,
###388 I spent one summer learning to be a glider pilot and getting my glider pilot’s license.
###392 Right at the age of 16 I became a powered pilot. A significant percentage of commercial
###399 pilots in Canada, something like half of them, went through Air Cadets, so it’s a great
###403 program set up by the country that allows young Canadians to pursue an area of specialized
###408 interest that then makes them useful to the country later on. Then I went to our military
###414 academies, which in our case was called Royal Roads Military College and then the Royal
###418 Military College of Canada, RMC, studying engineering. If you’re going to get into
###426 the air force or any phase of the military you have two different ways, you can come
###430 in directly or you can come through the military college system and I chose, I figured, well,
###435 the odds of being an astronaut are pretty lousy and I need something else as a real
###440 career, and so I decided I want to study engineering and then maybe I’ll be able to be a pilot,
###445 and then maybe I’ll be able to be a pilot as my profession for my whole life. Maybe
###449 I’ll get to be an astronaut, and fortunately, all of those things worked out, but I would
###454 have been happy at each one of those stages as I worked my way through. When I came out
###459 of military college I was lucky enough to be able to do a, master’s work, graduate
###464 level work. Then go on to fly and be able to fly Canada’s new fighter at the time
###469 which is our version of the F-18, we called it the CF-18. I flew those for NORAD [North
###474 American Aerospace Defense Command], then I did exchange to the U.S. Air Force Test
###477 Pilot School, and then flew as an exchange pilot, a Canadian flying F-18s with the U.S.
###483 Navy in Patuxent River. So that long, convoluted flow from an advanced education program as
###490 a ten year old kid or eleven year old kid in the enrichment program in elementary/middle
###497 school in Canada, all the way through to getting selected as an astronaut. I see myself very
###503 much a product of all of those structures and capabilities that Canada provided me.
###510 To fly as an astronaut is to assume some risks that most people don’t have in their lives;
###516 question is, what is it you feel that we get or learn as a result of flying people in space
###524 that makes it worth taking the risk?
###530 Almost everything worthwhile carries with it some sort of risk, whether it’s starting
###534 a new business, whether it’s leaving home, whether it’s getting married, or whether
###542 it’s flying in space. You are taking a risk: you are going from one known set of circumstances
###548 into a new set of circumstances, and everybody takes some of those risks during their life.
###554 It’s a natural progression of maturity, of the desire to do something with yourself,
###561 the desire to have a measure of success and increased capability and increased comfort
###568 in your life. Also maybe the desire to be able to look back at your life and say, I
###574 did something worthwhile in the time that I was alive. That manifests itself all different
###580 ways in human behavior. People try and answer those questions to themselves doing all different
###586 sorts of things. I made the choice early on what I thought was important was technical;
###591 I think it’s important to push back the level of what we can do technically, and I
###596 chose aerospace, and as a fighter pilot, I helped defend North America by using the latest
###603 of aerospace technology, but that wasn’t where I wanted to end up. I wanted to then
###608 get into aircraft design and testing and try and make airplanes safer, make airplanes more
###614 capable. We burnt a hydrogen-fueled engine on the wingtip of an F-18 trying to understand
###623 how to build a vehicle that could get you across the Pacific in an hour. Doing high
###629 angle of attack testing of F-18s, trying to make airplanes that could fly where airplanes
###633 could never fly before, that was really interesting to me, and it was risky. I lost a good friend
###638 a year for ten years as a fighter pilot and a test pilot. I knew that it was risky. My
###644 wife knew that we go to funerals on a fairly regular basis of people that are just doing
###649 their job, but you can’t make that omelet without breaking some eggs. You cannot do
###656 it. You have to be able to take some risks. Some things are worth taking a risk for. Even
###660 if you decide, OK, I’m going to spend my whole life sitting at my kitchen table and
###665 going in between there and my bed and hiding from risks, your house, eventually the ceiling
###671 falls down; there’s an earthquake, a hurricane, a lightning storm, a tornado or whatever.
###676 There’s no guarantees, you may as well try and do something worthwhile in the meanwhile
###681 and minimize the risks where you can. For me, spaceflight is just a natural extension
###686 of all of that. For the first time in history, if we muster all of our best of capabilities,
###693 we can just now safely start to leave the Earth, to go away from our planet, and to
###699 be part of that, to be able to be one of the early explorers that is opening the capability
###706 of leaving Earth, is fundamentally interesting to me but I also judge it as a very worthwhile
###713 thing. It’s an important thing in this stage of human development, like the first sailboats
###717 that left land or the first vehicles that could drive safely and conveniently on the
###722 surface, or the first airplanes. We’re at that level and I’ve wanted to be a part
###728 of it my whole life. I’ve devoted 20 years as an astronaut, and now there’s risk involved.
###734 I’m going to fly a Russian spaceship as the left-seater, sort of like the co-pilot
###742 and then live on a space station for six months and we might die in the effort but I might
###748 die driving home from work tonight. I’m going to manage things as best I can so that
###753 I live a long and healthy life, but a long, healthy and worthwhile life.
###759 You’re about to launch to the International Space Station for Expeditions 34 and 35. Chris,
###766 tell me what are the goals of this flight and what are your jobs going to be on this
###770 mission?
###771 The space station is there for a purpose and that is to do science that can’t be done
###777 on the surface of the Earth. That is the core purpose of the space station, and so our job,
###782 as the people on board, is to make sure that that science gets done. Everything else is
###786 sort of downstream of that. Yes, we need to fix things as they break; sometimes we have
###792 to go outside on spacewalks; sometimes we have to use the robot arm and grab a new delivery
###798 truck that’s full of equipment, but the core of it is to run those hundred and ten
###802 experiments that are running on board, and that’s our main job, to be the lab technicians
###807 as well as the plumbers and the delivery men and all the rest of it, but really the lab
###811 technicians that keep the International Space Station as the big international laboratory
###816 that it is.
###817 Now you didn’t do any of that the last time you visited the International Space Station.
###821 What are you looking forward to about the station, on this trip?
###825 On my first spaceflight I went to the Russian space station, Mir and built a piece of it
###830 using space shuttle Atlantis. The second spaceflight went to the international, the early, small
###834 International Space Station, and built a piece of it using space shuttle Endeavour. And both
###840 times I thought, wow, wish I could stay; what a desirable thing to do in life, be able to
###847 leave Earth and not just go build something and come back but to leave Earth for a while,
###852 change your zip code for a while and really become a resident. Both places I just felt
###859 so jealous of the experience as we undocked and left. And this time after a lot of lucky
###866 coincidences and a lot of hard work, now I get to be one of those crew members that stays
###871 for an extended period away from the planet, and it’s been a long road getting there,
###878 it’s been a huge amount of qualifications necessary to get there, a lot of luck to get
###882 there, but for me, it’s really a culmination of all the things that I’ve done for the
###886 last 20 years as an astronaut. I’m really looking forward to not just visiting space
###893 but moving to Earth orbit and having all of the internal changes, the understanding and
###902 the revelation that comes with that. I’m really looking forward to it.
###905 During your time there you’re going to have a number of crewmates, some who are there
###909 before you, some who will arrive later, two of them that you’re going to be with the
###913 whole time, and one of them, Tom Marshburn, you’re already “flown” with, although
###917 it was underwater on a NEEMO [NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations] mission. Has
###920 the experience of that mission, working with that crewmate, helped you guys prepare for
###925 this flight?
###926 I count myself hugely lucky to be flying with a group of people, the group of humans that
###931 I’m flying in space with. I’ve known all of them for a long time; Pavel Vinogradov
###937 and I trained together for a Mir flight back in the early ’90s. He came over to my house,
###942 I gave him his first Jet Ski ride back in about 1994, so we’ve been training together
###947 for a long time. Tom and I have climbed mountains together as part of [National] Outdoor Leadership
###953 School, as you say, we’ve lived at the bottom of the ocean together, and through all of
###957 that what’s important is shared experience. If you’re going to take a small group of
###962 people and ask them to do something that is really complicated or has really high stakes
###967 and potential for really complex things to happen, then it is great to have had a shared
###973 experience in advance, and as deep and representative an experience as possible. When something
###979 hard happens, if you can look at each other and remember back when we saw this before,
###984 or remember when we were out Jet Skiing together, or remember when we were living on the bottom
###988 of the ocean, that really gives you a foundation to build upon, to rely on and a shared confidence
###998 in your ability to deal with the unknown. I think the process by which we select astronauts
###1004 and cosmonauts, the way we train together, not just the technical training but the psychological
###1008 and the interpersonal training that we get is a really important and vital part of being
###1014 successful in spaceflight.
###1016 Any time you make a spaceflight you’re going to miss certain things on Earth. On this flight,
###1021 it turns out you’re going to be away for Christmas and New Year’s. What are your
###1025 thoughts about spending those holidays in space?
###1028 My family lives all around the world. I have a son who lives in China, a son who lives
###1032 in Germany and a daughter who lives in Ireland and my wife is back and forth, United States
###1036 and Canada, so really at the Christmas holiday is when we get together. This year we’ve
###1043 decided to bump it up a little and we’re going to get together for Christmas in Kazakhstan.
###1048 Makes a nice card, Christmas in Kazakhstan, that’s where we’ll be this year. So we’re
###1052 going to celebrate a little early. On the actual day, the traditional day, the twenty-fifth,
###1057 of course, it’ll be like the times when I was working here in Houston in Mission Control
###1061 on Christmas Day, which I did several times. It’ll be either we’ll shift the date;
###1066 I’ll phone in and have a video conference or talk to each of my family members all around
###1070 the world. It’s an understood part of the job. This is a very special year for us as
###1076 a family and everyone understands that it’s not going to be normal and this’ll be a
###1080 year, even though it’s not typical, a year to talk about for the rest of our lives.
###1084 I want to get you to set the scene for me. Tell me about the International Space Station
###1089 that you’re going to arrive at. Tell me, what’s there now? What are the modules and
###1094 the different facilities there that are there to support you and your crewmates, your mission
###1100 and yourselves?
###1104 So you’re in a spaceship, and you wake up and in the far distance you see a star, and
###1110 it’s like almost miraculous in that all the other stars stay the way they are but
###1115 this one star, as you approach it gets bigger and bigger and bigger, and then it stops being
###1120 a point of light and starts becoming this three-dimensional thing, and the closer you
###1123 get to it, the more you’re sort of staring at it in incredulity and fascination because
###1128 it turns this big bug of appendages and things sticking out. Then it becomes enormous and
###1134 then it’s the size of a small town that you are approaching, it’s huge. I felt that
###1140 way coming up to Mir, I felt that way coming up to station even when it was small, and
###1144 now, from our little Soyuz looking out the window to come to station, as big as it is
###1149 now, we’ll see it, of course, the Japanese module, the European module, then all the
###1155 American segments up the middle, all of the Russian segments in the back, the huge truss
###1160 and the huge solar arrays: it’s a place away from Earth that humans have built. It’s
###1167 truly a big outpost or a big first great landing in another part of the universe and it feels
###1176 miraculous to sneak up on one of those and to find it in space, then drive ourselves
###1181 in and dock with our little spaceship, equalize pressure, open the hatch and go into this
###1186 thing. It’s every science fiction book, it’s every Arthur C. Clarke’s imagination
###1194 of what the orbital module might look like as you come up, and it’s this little astronaut
###1200 kid’s dream to be able to do that. It’s a massive, capable, human creation orbiting
###1205 the world, and I’m really looking forward to opening that hatch.
###1210 One of the pieces that were invaluable in putting that together is Canadarm2. That’s
###1216 a hunk of technology that you delivered to the space station. Tell me what else is still
###1222 to come for Canadian robotics and the station, for Canadarm and Dextre [Special Purpose Dexterous
###1228 Manipulator] and other things that are still in the pipeline.
###1231 The space station, as far as construction goes, is almost finished. There’s a Russian
###1236 laboratory to come up and there are other piece parts to go on but fundamentally it’s
###1242 built. That was job one for Canadarm2, to grab things out of the back of the shuttle
###1248 or to hand off from the shuttle’s arm to the Canadarm2, take them around, build the
###1253 station incrementally like a huge Meccano set or a huge LEGO set, getting bigger and
###1258 bigger. But that crane phase for the Canadarm, the construction phase, is pretty much finished.
###1265 Now it’s really just an extension of ourselves on the outside. When we need to go out and
###1271 look at something, it’s nice to have a camera on the end that you can go have a good close
###1275 look. When a new spaceship comes up, some of them reach out, grab one, take it around,
###1285 plug it in and help deliver all of the equipment to station and then return them back to Earth
###1291 or get rid of them again. Then also like a cherry picker or like a Wichita lineman, sometimes
###1299 you need to go out and fix something. You need to use both hands and with the Canadarm2,
###1306 as a spacewalker, you can click your feet into the foot restraint and the arm can drive
###1311 you around as if you were a tool on the end of a surgeon’s probe, and then it’ll get
###1317 you exactly where you need. As Suni [Williams] and Aki [Hoshide] did recently in fixing the
###1323 big electrical box on the outside of space station. The arm is just a wonderful extension
###1328 and tool for us to be able to work on the outside of the space station. Canadarm2 after
###1336 having helped build the station all the way through continues to keep the station vital
###1342 and capable. When something comes up with new experiments, fresh food and clean clothes,
###1348 that’s what we do, the grabbing and installing and have our Christmas morning as a result
###1354 of Canadarm2’s work.
###1356 You’ve mentioned that the assembly of the station that has gone, taken over ten years,
###1361 pretty much done, and the focus now is turning on to science. How do you explain to people
###1367 what the potential is for what kind of science return the station can provide?
###1376 Having the laboratory like the space station functions on two different levels. One is
###1381 the obvious one that you have a laboratory with basically no gravity. You can then do
###1387 experiments that are impossible anywhere else—well, maybe you can go to the top of a building,
###1393 drop your experiment and it falls. The time that it’s falling is sort of weightless;
###1397 we do that, drop it down old mine shafts so it can fall a couple thousand meters, but
###1404 that’s only a short period of seconds and there’s still the air drag slowing it down.
###1408 You can put it in the back of an airplane and maybe get 20 seconds of good weightlessness.
###1412 On the space station we have perpetual absence of gravity, and so there are all sorts of
###1419 experiments that you can do on space station that you can’t do anywhere else, and that
###1424 is the fundamental core of it. But the other part is, there are some things that are just
###1430 fundamentally exciting to people and one of them is exploration and leaving Earth. To
###1438 be able to do this thing that is new in the human experience is fundamentally exciting.
###1442 When I sit next to somebody on a bus or in an airplane and they find out that I’m one
###1447 of the humans that leaves Earth, that’s all we talk about from then on because no
###1451 matter whom they are, this is an interesting thing. This is new in the human experience.
###1454 This is something that is sort of joyous and exciting to hear about, and as a result of
###1460 that it brings people together. That fundamental shared excitement of something new in humanity’s
###1467 experience, no matter where you’re from, it brings people together and so it doesn’t
###1473 just bring astronauts together or people on the bus together, but it brings scientists
###1477 and researchers together. Not only have we built a place where you can do experiments
###1485 with no gravity, where we have a lot of electricity, a lot of time, a really good environment,
###1489 but also it challenges and it inspires people from all around the world to try and use this
###1495 new experience, to bring them together, to get people from one corner of the world talking
###1499 to people from the other corner of the world that without this shared new capability and
###1505 challenge, they would never have spoken to each other. And so it functions on both those
###1509 levels, we see it every day on board station, and a lot of the work that goes on is the
###1514 daughter or granddaughter of that type of great harmony of environments.
###1520 Let’s talk about some of that research. One of the areas that station research focuses
###1525 on is finding out how being in that environment affects a human body and what we can do to
###1532 counteract the bad effects. Tell me about two or three of the human life sciences investigations
###1538 that you’re going to be involved with.
###1542 If you’re going to do experiments on a space station, some of them are going to be just
###1549 taking advantage of the lack of gravity. Some of them are going to be to look at the world,
###1553 at the universe, to test equipment and to just look at things that are different because
###1559 there’s no gravity. One of the big differences is how a human body functions when you take
###1564 away gravity. Some of it is obvious. When you swallow your food it doesn’t sit in
###1569 the bottom of your stomach, it floats around. When you are floating inside the station your
###1575 balance system doesn’t know which way is up. You don’t stand up and your body never
###1580 has to push the blood back up to your head again. For six months you don’t have to
###1589 hold your head up, that’s how lazy you can be. The resulting changes in the human body
###1595 are one of the things that we study. One of the experiments we have on board is called
###1602 Vascular [Cardiovascular Health Consequences of Long-Duration Space Flight], and it’s
###1604 looking at what happens to the cardiovascular system when you live in an environment like
###1608 that. The heart actually shrinks. You’re aging on a rapidly accelerated scale, your
###1616 heart actually shrinks and your blood vessel response changes; it actually sets us up to
###1622 cardiovascular problems. If you had something that was pretty low grade on Earth, after
###1626 six months of an environment like that, a risk of a heart attack or a stroke might actually
###1632 be quite a bit higher. We have a sequence of experiments that’s taking blood samples
###1638 and monitoring our body while we’re exercising and doing different things to try and understand
###1643 what’s going on with our cardiovascular system. It also challenges people to try and
###1649 do the science in orbit. We have an experiment called Microflow [Microflow technology demonstration]
###1654 that used to be a big piece of equipment installed at a hospital, they would try to figure out
###1659 how can we actually sample the crew member’s blood while they’re in orbit and get looking
###1664 at the individual cellular level, as a result, have got it down to the size of a toaster.
###1670 It’s like Tony Stark in “Iron Man,” where he’s trying to see if that thing in
###1676 his chest has made his blood radioactive, he puts this little thing in, tests his blood
###1680 and looks at it. Now on orbit we have a thing the size of a toaster, it’s not quite movie
###1685 grade yet, but we can take a tiny amount of blood, and using an optical system that was
###1692 very recently developed, that little bit of blood goes through there and it can give us
###1695 results in blood analysis within ten minutes. There’s a capability driven by an opportunity,
###1702 driven by a set of circumstances that then has great opportunity on Earth. If you can
###1708 now do blood work with a very small machine, then remote communities can do it and food
###1713 processing factories can do it. It’s taking this challenge and some of the limitations
###1719 of what we’re doing, coming up with a new product and then realizing that this is going
###1723 to be good all over the place. That’s a piece of hardware we’ll be testing on our
###1729 crew. There’s a lot of orthostatic stuff as well. The final piece I want to talk to
###1735 you about is the aging process; the loss of bone and the loss of muscle strength it is
###1749 so rapid for astronauts in space. It’s as if you spent months, years, or even decades
###1753 on Earth, happens in just a few months in orbit. Using changes in exercise and changes
###1761 in diet, we have basically found a way to beat that type of osteoporosis so that we
###1770 can have crews that used to come back with significant bone loss, now come back basically
###1775 with no bone loss at all. This is really important if we’re going to leave Earth, go to an
###1781 asteroid or go to Mars, we don’t want the person to show up on Mars as a jellyfish.
###1787 They have to show up and be able to put on their spacesuit, go out and explore the surface,
###1791 or if after six months on station you have an emergency spacewalk you need to be strong
###1796 and fit with a good skeleton to go fight the suit and work outside. For the people here
###1801 on Earth that are naturally aging, getting osteoporosis and muscle wasting, there is
###1808 a combination of specific resistive exercise, a regimen of exercise, and a specific type
###1815 of diet, that we have proven in this environment. It will allow an astronaut to stay healthy
###1820 for the full six months, and therefore improving health of people on Earth and allowing us
###1826 to go further out into the solar system.
###1828 And station is also packed with a lot of specialized gear for science research in other scientific
###1834 disciplines, too. Give me a couple of examples of the different kinds of other science you’re
###1838 going to be working on.
###1842 We don’t know what the universe is made of, strangely enough. We’ve been looking
###1848 up at the sky, see things, but we really fundamentally are just discovering that we don’t even
###1852 really know what the universe is made of. If you measure how fast stars and galaxies
###1857 are moving away from each other the gravity, gravitational pull numbers, it all doesn’t
###1862 make sense unless you say, there must be something out there causing these other effects. We
###1866 call it dark matter and dark energy, by all of our theories there should have been the
###1871 same amount of matter and antimatter created at the beginning of the universe. So how are
###1877 you going to figure that out? It’s hard down here on the surface; the atmosphere filters
###1882 most of that information. So we decided a little over a year ago to mount on top of
###1887 the space station a seven-ton magnet that collects the matter and the tiny little particles
###1896 of the universe. It’s already processed 32 billion different particles from the universe.
###1906 The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer and all of the different sensors that are in it are trying
###1911 to understand what the stuff of the universe is: what are the origins of it and therefore
###1918 what’s the future of it and what is our place in it. That’s a really hard thing
###1922 to do on the surface of the Earth, it’s even hard to do on a satellite, but the station
###1925 is a huge, powerful, stable platform above the atmosphere for decades, and so it’s
###1931 a great place to mount a long-term sensing experiment like that. We also have a sensor
###1938 on the outside looking at all the x-ray sources in the universe, trying to understand black
###1944 holes and some of the less visible stars out. On the inside without gravity, heat doesn’t
###1953 rise; seems simple but it’s hard to get your mind around what that means. If you put
###1958 a pot of water on a hot plate, it doesn’t boil right because you don’t get cold water
###1964 at the top and hot water at the bottom then the heat rises and causes those nice convection
###1967 patterns. So what happens if you take a tube of water on the space station and you heat
###1972 one end? Does the water just get warm at this end and stay cold down here? Well, there was
###1978 an Italian physicist, Marangoni, who realized that surface tension, if you take a glass
###1983 of wine and you swirl your glass of wine around and you see how it sticks to the wine glass,
###1990 that’s the surface tension, the viscosity of the wine. That viscosity changes with temperature,
###1998 so if you have a tube of water and you heat one end, the Marangoni Effect, viscosity of
###2004 the water, changes as you heat it; in effect, the water starts to move around due to an
###2007 entirely different process than we normally can see on Earth. If you start thinking about it,
###2022 you can then study all sorts of fundamental fluid physics that we just can never study
###2026 on Earth. We can look at how stars form because here we have an environment with particulate
###2032 in it just like little bits of matter in the universe and get it spinning and see how those
###2038 things behave over time, how they flow with these Marangoni currents. We can design a
###2043 blood sensor with just a tiny little bit of human blood, but because we understand due
###2050 to the Marangoni forces how it will flow, we can then take a tiny blood sample and just
###2055 using the viscosity of it, move it around and sample it, so that’s an application
###2060 for here on Earth. When you’re welding something it’s not just gravity that’s moving the
###2066 liquid metal around but it’s a lot of those Marangoni forces. The viscosity forces melt
###2071 the flux and the metal all together, and we can better understand how welding works and
###2078 improve quality of welding. So the space station is this incredible, unique laboratory, an
###2088 environment that has been really hard to build, but we’ve created this thing. So many of
###2095 the leading minds of the world, right up to Nobel laureates, are using that capability
###2100 up there to push further back into our understanding of fundamental processes and where we are
###2106 in the universe.
###2107 And for the crew, you’re not only there to help run those experiments, you’re there
###2112 to make sure that the station continues to operate so that those experiments can run.
###2118 What do you do during the day? What’s a crew member’s day like on board the station?
###2125 For the people that have been out on a sailboat or a ship for a long time, where you get out
###2131 of sight of land, you’re there for some purpose. Maybe you’re transporting equipment
###2136 somewhere, you’re going to do research, going to go look at coral reef life, or maybe
###2143 you’re just out for a day sailing and you want to get a tan or go visit or just have
###2146 a nice time. Part of your day is to do what you went for, to look at the coral reef or
###2152 to lay back and look at your tan, but part of it is getting the sailboat ready when you’re
###2158 about to take it out of harbor. It is operating the sailboat, steer it, get the sail trimmed
###2163 right; you have to pay attention, things break. Your compass starts sticking, your radio or
###2170 the toilet in the sailboat doesn’t work properly—part of your day is going to be
###2174 that. Then part of your day is just taking care of yourself as a human being, you need
###2179 to sleep, eat, and wash. Space station’s exactly the same. You spend part of your day
###2185 just being a person. You wake up in the morning, take care of all of your typical morning activities:
###2190 breakfast, read the news, use the toilet, get cleaned up, maybe exercise. We don’t
###2196 get exercise for free on the space station just by walking around, raising our arm or
###2201 picking up water, you don’t fight gravity ever, therefore you can be so lazy and you
###2207 have to deliberately exercise, sort of like if you were living on a boat, you have to
###2211 deliberately exercise. Then part of your day is fixing things. It’s a big, complicated
###2216 structure and things break, so part of the life of an astronaut is fixing everything
###2220 from a cord in the back of a laptop that has stopped working to the air purification system,
###2227 or maybe something as huge as going outside to replace or repair a big piece of the station
###2233 that has broken. Another part of the day is running the experiments on board, which is
###2238 the real core purpose of being there. Your days are divided up just like that. Every
###2242 day you’re a human being staying alive, a technician keeping the space station alive,
###2248 and a scientist doing research.
###2251 When you arrive on the Soyuz spacecraft, you’re going to join the International Space Station
###2256 crew as a flight engineer, but in the midst of your mission, when Expedition 35 begins,
###2263 you’re going to become the commander of the International Space Station. How’s that
###2267 change life for you?
###2270 I’m lucky enough to be able to spend just a little under six months, on the space station.
###2276 It is a long time, six months, a lot of things can happen, but for the first half, which
###2285 I count myself really lucky, is that I don’t have to show up there and be in charge. I
###2291 show up and the commander will be Kevin Ford, and what a great opportunity for me to learn
###2297 because eventually I’m going to be asked to command the space station, but I don’t
###2301 have to jump in and be full speed, running and take over right away. I can do a bunch
###2307 of on the job training. I can “fleet up,” as they say in the Navy, and I can do my job,
###2312 be a flight engineer answerable to the commander, and listen to all the ways that Kevin has
###2318 decided. Kevin is learning them from Suni Williams who learned them from Gennady Padalka
###2322 so there’s this long pedigree of refined and proven ways to do things that are never
###2329 going to be seen properly here on our simulators. There’s always subtle differences, so I
###2333 will have three months to really learn how Kevin’s running things and look at it: if
###2340 I were the commander I would do that; I would do that differently, I wouldn’t do that,
###2343 and I’ll be able to pick and choose. Come March, when it’s time for Kevin and his
###2349 crew to get into their Soyuz and go home, he and I will have a ceremony on board, salute
###2354 each other, and from that moment on the health of my crew, the space station, and all of
###2361 the things we’re trying to do productively, are all resting on my shoulders, weightlessly,
###2366 but resting on my shoulders. I need to be ready for that. I’ve been training with
###2373 that in mind for several years here on Earth, working to build the crew, to make sure we
###2378 have the skills but also the relationship that would allow us to be healthy and productive
###2383 during that time, and also making sure that I understand things well enough. No matter
###2388 what breaks on the station or no matter what experiment’s going on, I have to have some
###2392 understanding so that I can make the right decisions, as things happen during the six
###2399 months. At this stage in my career, in my 50s, I’ve been an astronaut 20 years, flown
###2405 a couple times, I consider it a huge lucky break, because I’ve been gathering experience,
###2413 I’ve been trying to see how to do these things. I’ve been learning from other people,
###2417 and to be given the opportunity to command what is essentially the world’s spaceship,
###2425 now at this stage of my career, I consider it a great responsibility but also a great
###2432 turn of events and a great challenge and opportunity for myself. I’m really looking forward to
###2438 it.
###2439 You’re also going to be the first Canadian astronaut to command the space station. What’s
###2443 it mean for Canada and Canada’s space agency to have a commander?
###2449 Canada had its first spacecraft go to orbit 50 years ago; it was called Alouette. We were
###2454 the third nation on Earth to have a satellite in space. We did it cooperatively—it was
###2459 on an American rocket, but a Canadian satellite, so it kind of laid the grounds for how we’re
###2464 doing everything. We have some specialty back home in Canada. We have a set of our own interests,
###2469 in this case, the upper atmosphere and the northern lights. Living in the north, we had
###2473 a need, a capability, we cooperated with another nation and we got ourselves into space. So
###2479 we’ve been in the game from the beginning right on the accomplishments of Alouette,
###2486 that very first satellite. Canada has almost linearly built our capability and our responsibility
###2493 and therefore our international respect over time. We went from that to sensing satellites,
###2499 telecommunications satellites, RADARSAT, the first Canadian to fly on the shuttle, Canadarm
###2505 which did so many things from the Hubble telescope to all of the satellites. It grabbed and released,
###2511 and then with the other arm, onto the space station. We’ve had Canadians go, from Mark
###2516 Garneau, our first who was a payload specialist back in the early ’80s, through to Julie
###2520 Payette who was the main flight engineer running the space shuttle during her last flight,
###2527 and then Bob Thirsk who lived on station as a flight engineer. Even though no one could
###2533 map it out on purpose that way, it has appeared fairly linearly and progressive to now where
###2538 Canada is in a position to have a Canadian command the International Space Station. Each
###2545 has been a door opening of possibilities for young Canadian kids: this is something you
###2550 can do, this isn’t just a dream but this is an actual career choice; this is a thing
###2554 that can happen in your life. As a result, this is a big deal in Canada. This is a brand
###2561 new capability. It’s something to be proud of, something to look at in perspective of
###2569 time, look backwards and see how we got here, look forwards and say, look where this is
###2573 going. We’re going to other planets eventually and Canada is part of this. I feel the responsibility
###2580 of that as the first Canadian to do it. Fundamentally, for me it’s the first time. Regardless,
###2586 it’s a big deal for me, but also it’s a big deal for my country, for my space agency
###2591 and for where I’m from, and I’m happy that people are interested in it. I’m fundamentally
###2599 happy that this is a continuation of all of those capabilities and it continues to open
###2606 opportunities for the Canadians that follow after me.
###2609 What’ll it mean to you to have been that Canadian who was first?
###2617 I hate to jinx something by talking about things in advance because I would like things
###2621 to go well; that’s been my goal for a decade, preparing for this flight of getting myself
###2628 into a position to try and do this job well. Since the outset I’ve said I want to come
###2635 back with a healthy crew, with a crew that sort of my measure is, would they want to
###2640 go do this again right away and if they want to go do this again, then it was a good human
###2644 experience. I want to come back with a healthy space station, and having done as much of
###2650 the science as we possibly could in our six months on the station. If through luck and
###2661 the work of the crew we get all those things done, then of course this is one of the pinnacles
###2667 of what I was asked to do during my life, and this is a big event for me personally.
###2673 It takes a lot of work, a lot of focus, but it deserves it and I’m really working hard
###2680 hoping that when we land at the end of May that I’ll be able to look back and say I
###2685 did what I set out to do and I handed the station off to Pavel Vinogradov in as good
###2691 a state as I possibly could. It’s something that I can look back on as an accomplishment
###2697 and a threshold of my life that was really important for me.
###2700 Anyone who has taken a look at your biography sees that among many interests that you have,
###2706 music is one of them, and you’ve got some special music plans for this mission. Tell
###2711 me about your plans for recording music and a sing-along with students all across Canada.
###2718 On board the space station there’s a Canadian guitar. It’s a Larrivee, made in Vancouver.
###2723 That’s just luck, I didn’t get the guitar up there, but it turns out when they bought
###2727 one in a local guitar shop here in Houston, they ended up buying a Larrivee, which is
###2732 great, it’s a nice guitar. I play guitar in a couple bands and sing. I’ve fronted
###2737 bands here in Houston for 20 years, and it’s just a natural extension for me to play music
###2743 no matter where I am, whether it’s at Star City or Tsukuba, Japan, or on board the space
###2747 station; I played guitar on board Mir when I was there back in 1995. I thought, since
###2753 I’m there long enough; why not write music about the experience of traveling in space.
###2761 The early sailors, the early miners, the early cowboys, the pioneers that moved into a new
###2768 human environment, all of them have recorded the experience not just in journals, but also
###2777 in song and in music. To be able to use that new environment to help inspire art in the
###2786 form of music is a way that I thrive on Earth. I’m not by any means the world’s best
###2792 musician, but I love it and I’ve had lots of people to play music with. To be able to
###2797 do that on space station is fairly new in the human experience and I want to make the
###2803 most of it. You can record it lots of different ways. You can write a journal, a blog every
###2807 day, take a million photographs out the window, try and capture this new human experience
###2813 different ways. For me, music is a great way to do that recording. I’ve half-written
###2819 a bunch of songs and I’ve completed some. I’ve made sure that we have the equipment
###2824 on board, not just the guitar but the right combinations of pickups, microphones, recording
###2829 equipment, and files and how to get it down to the ground, so that we have a reasonable
###2835 recording studio on the International Space Station. I’m going to have the chance to
###2841 float weightless inside the Cupola with the world rolling by underneath playing a guitar
###2848 inside probably the most scenic recording studio that’s ever existed, and a chance
###2853 to record the songs that I have written, to work and write new songs or expand the songs
###2859 while I’m up there, and for the rest of my life, to have those as my souvenirs, my
###2870 memories of living away from the Earth. My brother, who I write songs with, said, imagine
###2878 if the first people going to Mars, if when they sit around their mess table on the six
###2882 months on the way to Mars and they sing old space songs and one of the songs they sing
###2885 is something that you wrote on board the space station, a space shanty or whatever, what
###2890 an interesting idea, and it’s not inconceivable, so I’m really looking forward to that. Playing
###2899 music in space also attracts a lot of interest from other musicians. Lots of musicians of
###2905 all different levels, right up to some pretty famous bands have said, hey, we would love
###2910 to play with you while you’re up there or record something and we’ll incorporate you
###2915 into our concert or something like that. I’ve been looking at what’s the best way to do
###2921 that. One of them is with schools across Canada. How do you get involved with all the grade
###2927 school and high school bands across the country, and there are couple good programs that exist.
###2931 One is called MusiCounts, and they try to have one Canadian celebrity song a year that
###2940 is then learned by the school choirs and played during the year and it’s themed for the
###2944 year or some sort of particular theme. This year they decided to make a space theme and
###2948 they teamed me with one of the musicians in the Canadian band called Barenaked Ladies,
###2953 guy named Ed Robertson; Ed’s a great songwriter, he’s from the part of the world that I’m
###2957 from. So we’ve been working together for about a year now on a song, and actually this
###2961 week we just recorded sort of the final version of the song, and it will be put into full
###2972 orchestrated form and sent to schools so that the high school bands all have their particular,
###2976 the third trumpet has his part to play and the whole thing put together, choirs will
###2979 learn the words, and then I will be recording a part of it on the space station as well
###2985 and sending it down. There will then be a way to have the Barenaked Ladies’ version
###2990 of it with me adding in harmonies and singing verses and playing a little bit of guitar,
###2995 and then at school concerts throughout the school year, they will be able to play along
###3002 with us. They’ll be able to use our recording, our music, or even conceivably the whole thing
###3007 happening live or partially live with my recording and Ed Robertson and company. It’s a really
###3013 nice different way, to tie the newness of the experience and the imaginative part of
###3020 the experience with people all across the country. It’s a real privilege to be a part
###3026 of that.
###3027 Sounds like it’ll be fun.
###3029 Oh yeah, it’ll be fun, too.
###3032 Any increment on the space station has the plan to remain flexible to respond to things
###3039 that you made reference to earlier. Sometimes that means going outside. What is, as we speak
###3045 today, what is the plan for spacewalks during your time on board?
###3050 We have a richness of experience in our crew. People have done multiple spacewalks in the
###3055 past, both on the Russian side and on the U.S. side or the Canadian side, so we’ve
###3064 been training for years to do spacewalks. There are all sorts of things that we have
###3069 looked at and said, if this fails we have to go out and do a spacewalk within this number
###3073 of days to go fix it—electrical things, cooling things or something like that. So
###3079 we’re ready to go do those. Right now, as of today, there is nothing broken on the space
###3086 station that will absolutely, black and white, hard-require us to go outside, but sort of
###3092 like maintenance on your car—well, I think I can get another hundred miles out or another
###3097 thousand miles out before I have to change the oil or get the air conditioner fixed.
###3102 Well, another thousand miles go by and you go, maybe another 500—there’s a lot of
###3106 things on station like that, too. You don’t want to replace things that don’t need replacing,
###3110 but there is some sort of regular maintenance required to keep a machine running, and, unlike
###3115 your car, where if it breaks you can just pull over to the side and call AAA or call
###3118 a tow truck, if the station has a serious problem we have to continue to live and survive
###3123 up there, so it’s a real balance, juggling, guessing game as to when you have to go outside
###3131 and fix things. We’re trying to make sure that the crew can go outside and do any of
###3139 the spacewalks it may be asked to do, everything from something minor like retrieving a payload,
###3144 the MISSE [Materials International Space Station Experiment] payload that is collecting particles
###3147 of the universe, it’s been out there collecting them for years, we can fold that up like a
###3153 big suitcase and bring it inside, and that would be a good thing to do. There are cameras
###3156 and lights outside that have failed that decrease our capability to see what we’re doing;
###3160 some of those need to be swapped out. There are covers that need to go on certain parts
###3167 of the station to improve and lengthen their life because of all the thermal cycles and
###3173 the micrometeorite damage. There’s a big long shopping list of stuff we really should
###3176 do as soon as we get outside and have the spare time. Like doing maintenance on your
###3179 house; I have to clean out the gutters—that can wait a little while but the next time
###3182 it rains it’s going to be a mess. That’s kind of the boat we’re in. So as a crew
###3186 we’re trained, we’re ready, and we’re optimistic that something’ll break.
###3193 The landscape of spaceflight is changing these days. Now we’ve got private companies even
###3199 flying supply ships to the space station and, and all the different countries in the world
###3204 working together instead of competing. Is this the kind of arrangement, that you see
###3209 continuing on into the future of human space exploration?
###3214 Space travel is hard. It’s easy to do if you’re willing to kill people regularly—like
###3220 in the early days of aviation, planes crashed all the time, people got injured, it was sort
###3225 of [the attitude] “you know, it’s a risky business, OK, people are going to die.”
###3229 That’s not acceptable in space travel. Because of the complexity, the cost and the visibility
###3236 of it, we want it to be safe, as safe as we possibly can, and therefore it takes a lot
###3243 of preparation and it’s expensive and it’s rare. When something takes a lot of preparation
###3248 and it’s expensive and rare, it’s hard to do as one person, it’s hard to do as
###3253 a small group or even as an individual company, sometimes even as a nation. I mean, Canada
###3258 has not decided to launch their own people into space because of the complexity and the
###3262 cost; we would rather share the costs with another country or another group of countries
###3267 in order to make it as economically logical as possible, and the whole world is doing
###3274 that for the International Space Station, or at least 15 of the leading nations of the
###3279 world. That makes sense. If we had some huge breakthrough in engines so that suddenly getting
###3285 to space was just as easy as driving to the corner store, if you could just have your
###3289 “Back to the Future” little thing on top of your car where you throw in a banana peel
###3295 and “poof!” you’re off to space, the whole game would be different and people would
###3299 be going all the time. But it is still complex, hard, dangerous and expensive, and so for
###3304 the foreseeable future it is going to be, both at the business level and at the governmental
###3311 level, an international venture to build and live on the space station, go to the moon,
###3316 go to asteroids, and go to Mars. I think it’s the right thing to do. I think as a species,
###3326 as a shared group of people living on the surface of this planet, it makes sense if
###3330 we’re going to leave it and go somewhere else in the solar system that we should try
###3335 and do it as collectively as possible, both to share the cost of it but also to share
###3339 the benefits of it. So it’s kind of driven by the physics and the complexity, but there’s
###3346 certain purity and a beauty to that. The result that we’re doing it internationally and
###3351 collectively, I think, is a really good one, and I hope that we can prolong that as long
###3356 as possible and not turn it into just a purely competitive, a one-shot deal or kind of a
###3366 thoughtless, selfish way of exploring the universe. I really like the way we’re doing
###3370 it as a species right now and I want to help prolong that.
###3373 What is it that we are learning now on this space station that is preparing us for future
###3380 exploration further beyond Earth orbit?
###3384 On the space station, let’s look at something really simple; a little pump that has to move
###3390 water around like the pump in your radiator in your car. Well, pumps have liquid in there,
###3397 the pump spins and it moves the liquid through. Without gravity the liquid doesn’t stay
###3402 in the bottom part of the pipe. It will stick to the walls of the pipe and the pump will
###3407 just be spinning and moving air through the middle, so a pump doesn’t work in space.
###3412 You need to redesign it, and once redesigned, it doesn’t cool itself normally because
###3416 heat doesn’t rise, so how do you keep your pump from overheating? Seems trivial and simple,
###3421 but you have to solve that problem. How do you build a space pump? How do you build a
###3425 space fan? How do you build a space computer, a space toilet, a space everything? How do
###3431 you make sure that it’s going to work? Because if you say, let’s go to the biggest rock
###3440 in the asteroid belt; OK, and now we are, our spaceship needs pumps. Well, if you launch
###3445 from Earth and you start leaving Earth and you find out that you had a bad idea how to
###3448 build pumps, then you can’t just turn around and come home and you’re fundamentally flawed.
###3452 You need to test those somewhere, and you can’t test things perfectly here on the
###3458 surface of the Earth because you can’t escape gravity and the effects of gravity, so the
###3462 space station is the test-bed for the spaceships of the future. Just by its very nature we’re
###3469 learning what works and what doesn’t work, how to collect solar energy from the sun,
###3473 make it power and cool a spaceship; how to, what thrusters, what fuel should you use,
###3480 how do you have your thrusters work; what material do you build your spaceship from—if
###3484 you know you’re going to get peppered by micrometeorites and ultraviolet energy from
###3488 the sun and radiation from the universe, what do you build it out of? We’re experimenting
