2
0:0:0,866 --> 0:0:2,75
NIMROD KAMER: Venice, 2012.


3
0:0:2,75 --> 0:0:5,45
The 69th Annual Film Festival.


4
0:0:5,45 --> 0:0:9,87
I had arrived in style to sell
a Pierce Brosnan sex tape.


5
0:0:9,87 --> 0:0:13,742
I was financing my trip for the
sale of MDMA NYPD stolen


6
0:0:13,742 --> 0:0:16,53
from Macaulay Culkin's
kitchen.


7
0:0:16,53 --> 0:0:21,29
But most importantly, I had
enjoyed some creamy puddings.


8
0:0:21,29 --> 0:0:24,32
I am Nimrod Kamer, a social
climber disguised as a


9
0:0:24,32 --> 0:0:28,41
journalist, and this is my film,
"How To Make It #Huge In


10
0:0:28,41 --> 0:0:33,885
The Film Industry (And
Also Get Fingered.)"


11
0:0:33,885 --> 0:0:36,99
I had achieved so much already,
so I splashed out on


12
0:0:36,99 --> 0:0:39,39
a food salad and a
glass of spritz.


13
0:0:39,39 --> 0:0:42,575
You can put it on Michael
Fassbender's room account.


14
0:0:42,575 --> 0:0:43,875
It's OK.


15
0:0:43,875 --> 0:0:47,2
Room, I think, 344
or something.


16
0:0:47,2 --> 0:0:50,36
The cold food made me realize
that to make it #enorm in the


17
0:0:50,36 --> 0:0:52,76
film industry, I had to be
among the Venice 1%.


18
0:0:52,76 --> 0:0:56,9



19
0:0:56,9 --> 0:0:58,6
I want to put money in
films, actually.


20
0:0:58,6 --> 0:0:59,62
I'm a merchant in Venice.


21
0:0:59,62 --> 0:1:0,14
MIRAMAX CEO: Cool.


22
0:1:0,14 --> 0:1:3,89
NIMROD KAMER: I want to put some
money on films, but if


23
0:1:3,89 --> 0:1:6,43
you don't pay me back, I have
take a piece of your flesh.


24
0:1:6,43 --> 0:1:7,37
MIRAMAX CEO: [LAUGHING]


25
0:1:7,37 --> 0:1:8,34
Call it good collateral.


26
0:1:8,34 --> 0:1:10,41
NIMROD KAMER: Small
piece, yeah.


27
0:1:10,41 --> 0:1:10,95
- Scuzi.


28
0:1:10,95 --> 0:1:12,276
It's private.


29
0:1:12,276 --> 0:1:13,7
NIMROD KAMER: Private party?


30
0:1:13,7 --> 0:1:16,622



31
0:1:16,622 --> 0:1:18,83
See you later.


32
0:1:18,83 --> 0:1:21,1



33
0:1:21,1 --> 0:1:26,69
Film finance and XLS files were
so boring, so I casually


34
0:1:26,69 --> 0:1:29,98
wandered down the street where
I bumped into my old pal,


35
0:1:29,98 --> 0:1:31,63
Danny Huston.


36
0:1:31,63 --> 0:1:34,68
Danny and I go way back and
almost always agree on


37
0:1:34,68 --> 0:1:35,22
everything.


38
0:1:35,22 --> 0:1:36,33
DANNY HUSTON: Yes, yes, yes.


39
0:1:36,33 --> 0:1:36,92
Yes, yes,


40
0:1:36,92 --> 0:1:37,49
NIMROD KAMER: Yeah, yeah.


41
0:1:37,49 --> 0:1:38,47
DANNY HUSTON: Uh huh.


42
0:1:38,47 --> 0:1:41,675
I had Danny in mind for the lead
role in an [INAUDIBLE]


43
0:1:41,675 --> 0:1:42,68
book I'd optioned.


44
0:1:42,68 --> 0:1:45,19
ARI EMANUEL: A friend of mine
that I'm talking to is selling


45
0:1:45,19 --> 0:1:49,8
the movie rights to "50
Shades of Grey."


46
0:1:49,8 --> 0:1:53,64
NIMROD KAMER: It's about
spanking and submissive sex.


47
0:1:53,64 --> 0:1:54,75
Soft stuff.


48
0:1:54,75 --> 0:1:56,895
ARI EMANUEL: We will
talk more.


49
0:1:56,895 --> 0:1:58,145
NIMROD KAMER: Legitimate.


50
0:1:58,145 --> 0:2:3,4



51
0:2:3,4 --> 0:2:6,15
I set up a meeting with Harvey
Weinstein about a visionary


52
0:2:6,15 --> 0:2:10,34
sci-fi idea I had.


53
0:2:10,34 --> 0:2:11,71
NIMROD KAMER: Just for a sec.


54
0:2:11,71 --> 0:2:13,29
NIMROD KAMER: I just
want to say.


55
0:2:13,29 --> 0:2:13,83
NIMROD KAMER: I'm leaving.


56
0:2:13,83 --> 0:2:16,47
I just want to do the remake
of the remake of "Total


57
0:2:16,47 --> 0:2:19,0
Recall."


58
0:2:19,0 --> 0:2:19,39
NIMROD KAMER: Yeah.


59
0:2:19,39 --> 0:2:21,31
The remake of the remake,
because "Total Recall" was the


60
0:2:21,31 --> 0:2:22,83
best remake ever.


61
0:2:22,83 --> 0:2:23,915
You should remake that.


62
0:2:23,915 --> 0:2:25,228
Good to see you, girls.


63
0:2:25,228 --> 0:2:26,164
Yeah.


64
0:2:26,164 --> 0:2:29,846
I have Pierce Brosnan
sex tape.


65
0:2:29,846 --> 0:2:31,96
NIMROD KAMER: Thanks.


66
0:2:31,96 --> 0:2:34,22



67
0:2:34,22 --> 0:2:36,26
NIMROD KAMER: I could tell
Harvey Weinstein was


68
0:2:36,26 --> 0:2:38,365
interested by the movement
of his chin.


69
0:2:38,365 --> 0:2:41,85
It was only a matter of
time before he bid.


70
0:2:41,85 --> 0:2:44,578
What I needed now was actors.


71
0:2:44,578 --> 0:2:46,43
I can be your agent in London.


72
0:2:46,43 --> 0:2:49,81
I can put you in corporate
infomercials and


73
0:2:49,81 --> 0:2:50,52
all kinds of stuff.


74
0:2:50,52 --> 0:2:51,23
JOE PESCI'S BROTHER: Really?


75
0:2:51,23 --> 0:2:52,9
NIMROD KAMER: Yeah, yeah.


76
0:2:52,9 --> 0:2:53,795
JOE PESCI'S BROTHER: Can
you give me your card?


77
0:2:53,795 --> 0:2:55,72
NIMROD KAMER: I can represent
you in Paris and the Middle


78
0:2:55,72 --> 0:2:56,55
East if you want.


79
0:2:56,55 --> 0:2:58,36
I'm an agent, yeah.


80
0:2:58,36 --> 0:3:0,742
I'm an agent, a manager,
and a lawyer.


81
0:3:0,742 --> 0:3:2,57
I can represent her, yeah.


82
0:3:2,57 --> 0:3:5,59
I can give you stationery,
because my grandfather, he


83
0:3:5,59 --> 0:3:6,66
owns a stationery shop.


84
0:3:6,66 --> 0:3:7,68
MICHAEL LONSDALE: What's that?


85
0:3:7,68 --> 0:3:11,122
NIMROD KAMER: It's like pencils
and clipboards.


86
0:3:11,122 --> 0:3:13,762
Have you ever done,
like, nude scenes?


87
0:3:13,762 --> 0:3:15,345
[LAUGHING]


88
0:3:15,345 --> 0:3:19,72
NIMROD KAMER: I can give you
my card, definitely.


89
0:3:19,72 --> 0:3:22,236
I got some condoms here.
