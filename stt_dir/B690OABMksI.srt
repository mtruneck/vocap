1
0:0:0,13 --> 0:0:3,53
of the republic blue poles are out of
the

0:0:3,53 --> 0:0:5,67
its agenda twenty one yet


3
0:0:5,67 --> 0:0:7,53
the size of missouri


4
0:0:7,53 --> 0:0:9,139
if their doubts


5
0:0:9,139 --> 0:0:10,34
the real problem


6
0:0:10,34 --> 0:0:12,519
ads and that's what about the intense


7
0:0:12,519 --> 0:0:14,929
they respect problems


8
0:0:14,929 --> 0:0:18,689
they arent trade yeast co communities or
we can all walk


9
0:0:18,689 --> 0:0:21,359
t to one another


10
0:0:21,359 --> 0:0:22,66
can be spread out


11
0:0:22,66 --> 0:0:26,89
well into my old side note it's coming
into town


12
0:0:26,89 --> 0:0:30,379
in fact safeguards on skype its patrick
assess of course is a republican agenda


13
0:0:30,379 --> 0:0:31,24
twenty one


14
0:0:31,24 --> 0:0:33,26
well the building is a conspiracy theory


15
0:0:33,26 --> 0:0:36,7
but it's a real book


16
0:0:36,7 --> 0:0:40,33
it deals with probably rights in our
food source ideals of their ability to


17
0:0:40,33 --> 0:0:43,85
bring his food employees agricultural
methods


18
0:0:43,85 --> 0:0:45,45
uh... sounds very serious


19
0:0:45,45 --> 0:0:50,18
of impose explains fitzpatrick along
with her son of while roland


20
0:0:50,18 --> 0:0:54,68
the bill sponsor argued that the u_n_ is
pushing the sustainability plan


21
0:0:54,68 --> 0:0:57,44
to take away property rights


22
0:0:57,44 --> 0:1:4,36
uh... there we go


23
0:1:4,36 --> 0:1:7,3
all right so what is again that we want


24
0:1:7,3 --> 0:1:10,67
well those are resolution passed by the
united nations


25
0:1:10,67 --> 0:1:14,549
back in nineteen ninety two it's not
like an admin recently in their patting


26
0:1:14,549 --> 0:1:16,36
your dad eleven ninety two


27
0:1:16,36 --> 0:1:19,69
it was not grant a fly by the united
states senate


28
0:1:19,69 --> 0:1:22,96
and does not contain the force of law
and the united states


29
0:1:22,96 --> 0:1:27,85
in other words passing a bill as they're
planning in missouri to say that you


30
0:1:27,85 --> 0:1:29,7
cannot local


31
0:1:29,7 --> 0:1:31,429
problem and cannot enforce


32
0:1:31,429 --> 0:1:34,13
it's hard


33
0:1:34,13 --> 0:1:35,649
totally in well then


34
0:1:35,649 --> 0:1:40,24
this is not along the united states of
america of course they can enforce it


35
0:1:40,24 --> 0:1:44,17
it doesn't exist as a law here


36
0:1:44,17 --> 0:1:45,619
it was a resolution


37
0:1:45,619 --> 0:1:49,27
is a resident you see kirk intervarsity
alive


38
0:1:49,27 --> 0:1:53,249
but he did a great skit we did this show
on a lark forty years later you guys are


39
0:1:53,249 --> 0:1:55,37
still coming conventions overt


40
0:1:55,37 --> 0:1:58,12
with


41
0:1:58,12 --> 0:2:0,999
it will also send out a witness for the
planet


42
0:2:0,999 --> 0:2:4,979
news has a lot of public are probably
right because not all


43
0:2:4,979 --> 0:2:8,84
that movie ticket senator ted cruise
united states and abroad experts


44
0:2:8,84 --> 0:2:10,13

45
0:2:10,13 --> 0:2:13,62
talk about how that homes and other
engine that's what i want to go to jail


46
0:2:13,62 --> 0:2:15,62
anyway this is repeating what's right


47
0:2:15,62 --> 0:2:18,3
this lunatic is fiercely theory and this
is not going to pass legislation


48
0:2:18,3 --> 0:2:19,849
missouri right now


49
0:2:19,849 --> 0:2:22,629
cells are observances photo dot it


50
0:2:22,629 --> 0:2:25,15
one hundred and ten to forty


51
0:2:25,15 --> 0:2:27,569
favor it has passed


52
0:2:27,569 --> 0:2:30,43
there will be no problems of misery


53
0:2:30,43 --> 0:2:31,529
raha tha


54
0:2:31,529 --> 0:2:34,419
we four hundred gender twenty-one


55
0:2:34,419 --> 0:2:37,709
no resolution spare i'll tell you that


56
0:2:37,709 --> 0:2:40,51
navistar was said in the governor's
center but


57
0:2:40,51 --> 0:2:41,899
can imagine


58
0:2:41,899 --> 0:2:46,959
a hundred antenna forty past


59
0:2:46,959 --> 0:2:49,17
what do you have a lot next bigfoot


60
0:2:49,17 --> 0:2:51,42
happen ok dark


61
0:2:51,42 --> 0:2:55,899
of cap exceeded ford has a lot more
possible


62
0:2:55,899 --> 0:2:59,18
the united nations landing black
helicopters in the middle of missouri


63
0:2:59,18 --> 0:3:2,659
and forcing everyone in the harbor dolls


64
0:3:2,659 --> 0:3:6,389
just leaving you can't get any crazier
we move on to kansas


65
0:3:6,389 --> 0:3:9,859
where they are are trying similar things


66
0:3:9,859 --> 0:3:11,709
standards of this had t


67
0:3:11,709 --> 0:3:15,26
had already proposed legislation
yesterday on the twenty one last year


68
0:3:15,26 --> 0:3:16,769
last year he said quote


69
0:3:16,769 --> 0:3:19,51
or actually twenty eleven i should be
correct or years ago


70
0:3:19,51 --> 0:3:22,73
this resolution informs policy makers of
the aggressive


71
0:3:22,73 --> 0:3:27,129
environmental social engineering in
global political control


72
0:3:27,129 --> 0:3:29,729
but is it yet but what he


73
0:3:29,729 --> 0:3:34,19
so kansas is way ahead in this area on
the spot


74
0:3:34,19 --> 0:3:35,269
that's not all


75
0:3:35,269 --> 0:3:39,769
but i was going to a eleven and he wants
update so that same say senator comes


76
0:3:39,769 --> 0:3:42,99
then per se rat


77
0:3:42,99 --> 0:3:43,919
that separates them


78
0:3:43,919 --> 0:3:46,89
that he would like to ban


79
0:3:46,89 --> 0:3:49,759
sustainability


80
0:3:49,759 --> 0:3:52,769
his legislation would ban kansas state
local governments


81
0:3:52,769 --> 0:3:57,19
from spending public funds unsustainable
develop


82
0:3:57,19 --> 0:4:0,949
if i will take them to think about of
buddy that's


83
0:4:0,949 --> 0:4:3,669
we will not be sustainable and guests


84
0:4:3,669 --> 0:4:6,559
everything will immediately pair


85
0:4:6,559 --> 0:4:11,479
you will not be able to develop anything
that last past seven days


86
0:4:11,479 --> 0:4:15,519
what does it mean the band all
sustainable development


87
0:4:15,519 --> 0:4:18,599
which was looking at the but they
couldn't get any crazier


88
0:4:18,599 --> 0:4:21,269
happened can you accidentally break the
law


89
0:4:21,269 --> 0:4:25,689
home and i'm really sorry man that
nothing sustain itself like two weeks


90
0:4:25,689 --> 0:4:29,659
mcbride that bad it we can share


91
0:4:29,659 --> 0:4:31,36
now you think that's bad


92
0:4:31,36 --> 0:4:35,13
you know who that the same republican
lawmakers in kansas


93
0:4:35,13 --> 0:4:37,539
part of this would have a twenty-one
nonsense


94
0:4:37,539 --> 0:4:40,87
fought that biking to work or biking in
general


95
0:4:40,87 --> 0:4:42,749
was part of the u_n_ intend that


96
0:4:42,749 --> 0:4:45,169
they try to pass a law let me quote here


97
0:4:45,169 --> 0:4:48,27
that bypass were radical


98
0:4:48,27 --> 0:4:52,869
and destructive to the american way of
life


99
0:4:52,869 --> 0:4:56,4
this is a lot of the major political
parties


100
0:4:56,4 --> 0:4:59,81
in the largest and most powerful nation
on earth


101
0:4:59,81 --> 0:5:0,999
be afraid


102
0:5:0,999 --> 0:7:0,999
the very afraid
