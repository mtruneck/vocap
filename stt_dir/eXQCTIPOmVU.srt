Hi everyone I'm Paddy Kim. Get ready and pack your bags for the playground known as New Zealand


2
0:0:15,64 --> 0:0:23,3
a country whose people are nicknamed for their famous flightless bird : the kiwi


3
0:0:23,3 --> 0:0:28,35
New Zealand. It was discovered by humans less than a thousand years ago


4
0:0:28,35 --> 0:0:31,79
then rediscovered by moviegoers in 2001


5
0:0:31,79 --> 0:0:34,29
when the island nation stunning landscapes


6
0:0:34,29 --> 0:0:41,3
where splashed across theatre screens worldwide standing in for Middle Earth in the Lord of the Rings


7
0:0:41,3 --> 0:0:45,58
New Zealand's two main islands lie up the south-east cost of Australia


8
0:0:45,58 --> 0:0:50,22
put together the north and south Island are about the size of the Colorado


9
0:0:50,22 --> 0:0:54,74
but they pack plenty of geography into a small space


10
0:0:54,74 --> 0:0:56,88
from the picks of the Southern Alps,


11
0:0:56,88 --> 0:0:59,97
to Mossy forests ideal for hiking


12
0:0:59,97 --> 0:1:6,78
the scenery here lures not just sightseers but travelers looking to go outside and play.


13
0:1:6,78 --> 0:1:12,25
The majority of New Zealanders, about 75%, live on the north island


14
0:1:12,25 --> 0:1:16,56
Its biggest city, Auckland is also the biggest city in the country


15
0:1:16,56 --> 0:1:18,82
and nearly surrounded by water.


16
0:1:18,82 --> 0:1:23,75
Auckland claims to have more boats per person than any other city in the world.


17
0:1:23,75 --> 0:1:28,65
So it's a great place to sample a favorite kiwi pastime : sailing.


18
0:1:28,65 --> 0:1:31,17
If you want to get away from the city lights,


19
0:1:31,17 --> 0:1:39,58
Tangariro National Park is one of the north island's most popular places to go hiking or trekking as the kiwis call it.


20
0:1:39,58 --> 0:1:45,47
Bubbling mud signals that the area is still volcanically active.


21
0:1:45,47 --> 0:1:52,61
But most people seeking adventure head for the south Island where there is fewer people and more wilderness


22
0:1:52,61 --> 0:1:54,93
Christchurch is the gateway city.


23
0:1:54,93 --> 0:2:0,55
Originally settled by the British it's been called the most English city outside of England


24
0:2:0,55 --> 0:2:5,35
You can even go punting on the Avon river passing trough the botanical gardens.


25
0:2:5,35 --> 0:2:9,66
a relaxing way to unwind from an international flight.


26
0:2:9,66 --> 0:2:13,87
Nearly a third of the south island is protected as national parkland.


27
0:2:13,87 --> 0:2:20,17
There are trails for trekking, rivers and lakes for kayaking, caves to explore


28
0:2:20,17 --> 0:2:24,77
rocks to climb, and plenty of mountains for biking.


29
0:2:24,77 --> 0:2:30,62
The fly fishing is considered some of the world's best. Fishing here may look serene


30
0:2:30,62 --> 0:2:35,26
but landing a beauty in this pristine setting is heart-pounding in it's own way.


31
0:2:35,26 --> 0:2:38,15
<i>all right, here we go !</i>


32
0:2:38,15 --> 0:2:45,4
While you're outside, keep your eyes open for New Zealand's native wildlife. Fur seals are common along rocky coasts


33
0:2:45,4 --> 0:2:49,56
At Curio bay, you can spy yellow-white penguins coming ashore


34
0:2:49,56 --> 0:2:53,76
after their daily fishing trip from late afternoon until sunset.


35
0:2:53,76 --> 0:2:57,92
For a closer look at wildlife, head to the town of Kaikoura


36
0:2:57,92 --> 0:3:5,39
her deep waters close to shore attract a wide variety of marine mammals.


37
0:3:5,39 --> 0:3:10,93
Hop on a whale watching tour for a chance to see humpbacks, sperm whales and orca whales


38
0:3:10,93 --> 0:3:13,86
and with it's clear water and good visibility


39
0:3:13,86 --> 0:3:21,72
Kaikoura may be the best place in New Zealand to put on some flippers and go swimming with dolphins


40
0:3:21,72 --> 0:3:23,75
If you're planning to be outdoors,


41
0:3:23,75 --> 0:3:29,84
the best time to visit New Zealand is during its summer months of December, January and February.


42
0:3:29,84 --> 0:3:33,24
the most flexible way of getting around is by rental car


43
0:3:33,24 --> 0:3:35,25
just remember to drive on the left !


44
0:3:35,25 --> 0:5:35,25
and watch out for sheep on the way to your next destination.
