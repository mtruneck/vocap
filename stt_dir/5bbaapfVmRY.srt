0:0:17,539 --> 0:0:25,199
AZUZ: Usually on CNN STUDENT NEWS we say how
Fridays are awesome. For a lot of the U.S.,


7
0:0:25,199 --> 0:0:30,19
this Friday is frozen. You expect snow and
cold temperatures in the winter. What makes


8
0:0:30,19 --> 0:0:36,18
this storm different, is that it`s huge. Around
60 million people -- we`re talking 20 percent


9
0:0:36,18 --> 0:0:41,59
of the entire U.S. population potentially
effected by this. Governors and mayors have


10
0:0:41,59 --> 0:0:46,32
declared states of emergency. The area that`s
being hit is roughly the same size as Mexico,


11
0:0:46,32 --> 0:0:54,76
and the storm`s bringing some unusual weather.
You probably haven`t seen or heard that too


12
0:0:54,76 --> 0:0:59,519
often, it`s called thunder snow. And you need
the right ingredients for it to happen. Cold


13
0:0:59,519 --> 0:1:4,879
air on top of warm air with moist air close
to the ground. This massive winter storm is


14
0:1:4,879 --> 0:1:9,799
causing trouble problems like what CNN`s Ted
Rowlands ran into outside Kansas City.

TED ROWLANDS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The freeways
here are a mess. An absolute mess. I was stuck


17
0:1:14,5 --> 0:1:20,32
on I-29 for about an hour and a half just
dead still, I`ve gone on 35, I-70, all of


18
0:1:20,32 --> 0:1:25,599
it mess. And though biggest part is not only
visibility, but the snow accumulation is just


19
0:1:25,599 --> 0:1:30,74
-- it`s piling up, and people are getting
stuck, spinning out, there`s trucks all over


20
0:1:30,74 --> 0:1:34,259
the road, there are (inaudible) a couple of
medical emergencies, which, of course, have


21
0:1:34,259 --> 0:1:39,79
made it very difficult that the snow makes
it very difficult for first responders to


22
0:1:39,79 --> 0:1:44,9
get to those people and (inaudible) is they
warn people do not drive in this conditions.


23
0:1:44,9 --> 0:1:47,149
There`s a reason why. This storm is a whopper.

(END VIDEO CLIP)


25
0:1:47,89 --> 0:1:51,619
AZUZ: There might be a silver lining here.
Some of the states getting hit have been dealing


26
0:1:51,619 --> 0:1:56,7
with the terrible drought. So when all this
snow melts, the water could help relieve some


27
0:1:56,7 --> 0:1:58,39
of those drought issues.

AZUZ: An American online security companies
say Shanghai is home to a group of the world`s


34
0:2:32,54 --> 0:2:38,23
most effective computer hackers. U.S. Homeland
Security Secretary Janet Napolitano says Chin


35
0:2:38,23 --> 0:2:43,26
is one of the biggest sources for cyber attacks
against the United States. When you picture


36
0:2:43,26 --> 0:2:47,73
a hacker, you might think of one person, like
a lone wolf type, hammering away at a keyboard


37
0:2:47,73 --> 0:2:52,959
in the dark room somewhere. The American firm
says this group of hackers in Shanghai is


38
0:2:52,959 --> 0:2:54,25
connected to the Chinese government.

DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It`s clear
that this installation of buildings is closely


41
0:2:58,3 --> 0:3:3,959
watched by the People`s Liberation Army, and
allegation is that they`re working in conjunction


42
0:3:3,959 --> 0:3:10,99
with civilian hackers. As we got closer to
take a look, we got in trouble.

AZUZ: World of espionage is moved online.
It`s where cyber spies can get access to all


46
0:3:18,44 --> 0:3:24,9
kinds of sensitive information. Hackers might
be able to access electricity grid or telecommunications


47
0:3:24,9 --> 0:3:29,14
networks. This Shanghai group is accused of
stealing technology blueprints and sensitive


48
0:3:29,14 --> 0:3:34,489
business plans. Chinese officials deny any
connection to hacking. They say they`re the


49
0:3:34,489 --> 0:3:37,17
victim of cyber attacks, mostly from the U.S.

Florida.


53
0:3:48,269 --> 0:3:53,8
What amendment to the U.S. Constitution discusses
the right to bear arms? Here we go now. Is


54
0:3:53,8 --> 0:3:57,17
it the 1st Amendment, 2nd Amendment, 5th Amendment
or 10th Amendment?


55
0:3:57,17 --> 0:4:5,92
You`ve got three seconds, go!


56
0:4:5,92 --> 0:4:11,49
Those words show up in the 2nd Amendment.
That`s your answer and that`s your "Shoutout."

58
0:4:12,79 --> 0:4:18,19
AZUZ: You often hear the 2nd Amendment mentioned
alongside the issue of guns in America. Yesterday,


59
0:4:18,19 --> 0:4:22,94
a little more than two months after a school
in Connecticut, Vice President Joe Biden traveled


60
0:4:22,94 --> 0:4:28,17
there to promote stricter gun control, new
restrictions on who can buy guns and what


61
0:4:28,17 --> 0:4:33,1
guns can be bought. People who support gun
rights including the National Rifle Association


62
0:4:33,1 --> 0:4:38,1
say new restrictions aren`t going to help
stop gun violence, and may violate the 2nd


63
0:4:38,1 --> 0:4:41,2
Amendment. So, why exactly is there so much
debate over this?


64
0:4:41,2 --> 0:4:41,29
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


65
0:4:41,29 --> 0:4:45,26
JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST:
The 2nd Amendment may be the single most mysterious


66
0:4:45,26 --> 0:4:52,2
part of the Constitution. It`s an ungrammatical
sentence, it refers to militias, which don`t


67
0:4:52,2 --> 0:4:58,9
even exist anymore. And it`s been the subject
of an intense, intense controversy.


68
0:4:58,9 --> 0:5:6,68
The 2nd Amendment has two parts, the first
part talks about state militias. It says that


69
0:5:6,68 --> 0:5:14,52
state militias are a necessary part of national
defense. And the second part refers to the


70
0:5:14,52 --> 0:5:17,54
right to keep and bear arms.


71
0:5:17,54 --> 0:5:23,86
The question of how the two relate is something
people are still debating.


72
0:5:23,86 --> 0:5:33,78
Militias were effectively how the United States
raised armies in the early days of the Republic.


73
0:5:33,78 --> 0:5:43,84
There were essentially more or less volunteer
forces of young men who fought for their states


74
0:5:43,84 --> 0:5:50,3
and fought for the country in what we call
militias.


75
0:5:50,3 --> 0:5:56,97
Starting about 20 years ago, a lot of conservatives,
especially in the National Rifle Association


76
0:5:56,97 --> 0:6:2,5
started to say, look, the 2nd Amendment has
been misinterpreted by the courts. It is not


77
0:6:2,5 --> 0:6:8,56
just about state militias, it`s about individuals
rights to keep and bear arms. And the National


78
0:6:8,56 --> 0:6:16,22
Rifle Association, academics associated with
it, other academics started writing and arguing


79
0:6:16,22 --> 0:6:24,21
for an individual right to keep and bear arms.


80
0:6:24,21 --> 0:6:31,9
This question about what the 2nd Amendment
means, has one final arbiter. And that`s the


81
0:6:31,9 --> 0:6:38,9
Supreme Court of the United States. In 2008,
the Supreme Court said there was an individual


82
0:6:38,9 --> 0:6:47,62
right to keep and bear a handgun in your home.
Justice Scalia`s opinion in the 2008 Heller


83
0:6:47,62 --> 0:6:54,7
case said also the government can regulate
dangerous and unusual weapons. But what`s


84
0:6:54,7 --> 0:7:2,19
a dangerous and unusual weapon? We don`t really
know. Is it an assault weapon? May be. Is


85
0:7:2,19 --> 0:7:7,18
it tank? I think it`s safe to say yes. I don`t
think the Supreme Court is going back at this


86
0:7:7,18 --> 0:7:12,52
point. The court isn`t going to make it 180
degree turn on the 2nd Amendment, but they


87
0:7:12,52 --> 0:7:16,41
could certainly confine the right to keep
and bear arms.

her to dance flash-mob style. Julian and 19


91
0:7:30,78 --> 0:7:35,25
classmates choreographed a routine to a One
Direction song "One Thing." They did it in


92
0:7:35,25 --> 0:7:39,51
only four rehearsals. We talked to the best
friends about that moment, but first, we want

surprised.

NELUMS: Every time I watched it, I`m still
kind of like in awe that it all went down.


100
0:8:15,47 --> 0:8:18,62
And I kind of like my stomach and like jumps
-- oh, my gosh, we did this, and it went perfectly.


101
0:8:18,62 --> 0:8:24,52
OKEKE: I was like why are they dancing, and
why are they pointing at me and then I started


102
0:8:24,52 --> 0:8:28,69
seeing more and more of my friends coming
up, and I was like oh, where is Julian? And


103
0:8:28,69 --> 0:8:30,1
that is when I kind of got the clue.


104
0:8:30,1 --> 0:8:33,99
NELUMS: I was just listening to everything
happening, I was like oh my gosh, (inaudible)


105
0:8:33,99 --> 0:8:36,86
soon, so my heart was just pounding and pounding.
I was like I get to get this right.


106
0:8:36,86 --> 0:8:41,47
OKEKE: Well, yeah, actually -- I think we
got up in the moment that he didn`t ask me


107
0:8:41,47 --> 0:8:43,7
right there. Like later on, he had to (inaudible)
oh, yes, I forgot to ask you, we go and I


108
0:8:43,7 --> 0:8:47,49
already said yes in my mind, so. It was yes.

0:8:53,2 --> 0:8:58,13
somebody`s fancy prom date request. Tell us
the coolest way to ask someone to prom, those


112
0:8:58,13 --> 0:9:3,53
of you on Facebook can go to Facebook.com/snnstudentnews

Our last segment today is about a one trick
pony, but it`s a really good trick. Mariska


116
0:9:14,61 --> 0:9:19,45
the Mare is a master lock picker, she doesn`t
just let herself out of the barn, she opens


117
0:9:19,45 --> 0:9:25,75
the doors for all the other horses, too. Except
her mom. Probably, payback for all those lectures


118
0:9:25,75 --> 0:9:31,61
about leaving the barn door open. Mariska
opens doors, she opens gates, she opens coolers.


119
0:9:31,61 --> 0:9:36,61
Her owner finally latched on the idea to show
off the skills on Youtube. Did the video go


120
0:9:36,61 --> 0:9:41,12
viral? Oh, that was just a lock! We just hope
Mariska doesn`t forget how to do this escape


121
0:9:41,12 --> 0:9:44,78
act, because that`d be a shame to see her
stall out. And Mariska, you need to be nice


122
0:9:44,78 --> 0:9:48,74
to your mother, you two should really try
for a stable relationship. Have a great weekend,


123
0:9:48,74 --> 0:11:48,74
everyone.
