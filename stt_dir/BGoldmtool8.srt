SUROOSH ALVI: From what we were
seeing and hearing, the


3
0:0:17,79 --> 0:0:20,89
secular society that was the
hallmark of Saddam Hussein's


4
0:0:20,89 --> 0:0:25,14
Iraq has largely been replaced
with religious conservatism.


5
0:0:25,14 --> 0:0:28,11
Mix that with Western-inspired
youth culture, and there are


6
0:0:28,11 --> 0:0:29,97
going to be problems.


7
0:0:29,97 --> 0:0:32,64
Subcultures in Iraq
are under attack.


8
0:0:32,64 --> 0:0:35,8
For example, the Iraqi
equivalent of emo kids are


9
0:0:35,8 --> 0:0:37,6
being targeted.


10
0:0:37,6 --> 0:0:39,28
And in one of the biggest
stories out of Iraq since the


11
0:0:39,28 --> 0:0:43,162
US has left, a number of them
were supposedly killed.

SUROOSH ALVI: However, there
wasn't a lot of concrete


17
0:0:59,66 --> 0:1:1,5
evidence supporting
these stories.


18
0:1:1,5 --> 0:1:4,75
And some people thought that the
case of these emo killings


19
0:1:4,75 --> 0:1:7,17
was just scare mongering
to keep kids from


20
0:1:7,17 --> 0:1:9,19
straying from tradition.


21
0:1:9,19 --> 0:1:12,77
We went to meet with Dog Faced
Corpse and Fatalogy, two local


22
0:1:12,77 --> 0:1:16,75

opinion on it.


23

Oh, yeah.


24
0:1:17,7 --> 0:1:18,24
Great.

legit or is it bullshit?

didn't.

the things.

I think it's bullshit.

I think it's bullshit.

It's the month of Muharram.

the group that has it the
