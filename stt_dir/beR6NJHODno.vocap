###1 <i>One of the best things</i> <i>about friendship with Turk</i>
###4 <i>is challenging each other</i> <i>to try new things,</i>
###6 l can't believe we're going to a strip club.
###8 l don't think about it that way. lt's a place to buy a burger
###12 that's a two-and-a-half mile walk away from the hospital.
###15 No skin! We all win!
###17 Let's get outta here before we end up on the news.
###20 Are you gentlemen visiting the club?
###22 No, we're protesting.
###25 l'm worried about the kids.
###26 So what's that in your pocket?
###29 This is... lt's $38 in singles.
###31 l bought a newspaper and this is the change from my 40.
###36 Neil...
###39 Sir...
###41 - No pulse. - Starting CPR.
###44 Call an ambulance!
###47 Coming to you live as two young doctors are trying to resuscitate my cameraman.
###53 Well, maybe l'm biased, but to me,
###55 every doctor here at Sacred Heart is a hero.
###58 Does that mean l'm a hero? l don't know.
###62 There's my dynamic duo!
###64 Dr Dorian! Dr Turk!
###67 Holy inferiority complex, Batman!
###69 How low is my self-esteem that l'm the sidekick in my own fantasy?
###72 lt could be worse, Robin. You could be Alfred the butler.
###76 Damn you, sir.
###79 <i>Life in a hospital moves fast,</i> <i>One second you're a hero</i>
###82 <i>the next you're obsessing</i> <i>about evaluations,</i>
###84 - Who cares? lt's only a grade. - Really? What did you get?
###88 A-plus. l turned on the waterworks and the resident changed it to A-plus-plus.
###92 - A proud day for women everywhere. - Why are you worried?
###95 With the hero thing, whoever evaluates you will give you a gold star.
###99 Listen, Supergirl. l'm gonna break you into so many pieces
###102 that my grandmother, who can do a 1 ,000-piece puzzle in an hour,
###107 will never be able to put you back together,
###109 even if she goes go back in time to when her vision was perfect.
###113 Somehow l doubt it.
###131 Before you deny you like looking at strange naked women again,
###134 l should remind you that when you stay at my place, it's not a hotel.
###138 The movie titles do come up on the bill.
###142 l'm sticking with ''we were protesting.'' JD?
###144 Outraged and disgusted.
###147 Take Bambi out tonight. Maybe with the hype you can get him a girl.
###155 Who hasn't bought us drinks yet?
###159 lt could happen.
###163 - Don't wait up for me tonight. - OK.
###166 Do you wanna get drunk and beg me for sex now
###168 or wait till two o'clock tonight?
###171 - Let's wait. - Cool.
###173 You know, l'm off tonight. What are you doing, Carla?
###177 Just having dinner with a friend.
###180 <i>Man this is so uncomfortable,</i>
###183 <i>She's not gonna get the invite,</i>
###186 <i>Just hold your breath until it's over,</i>
###188 You could take Elliot with you.
###196 Great. l can't wait.
###200 Have a good time tonight.
###204 Lose something?
###206 No, why? Did you take something?
###209 - No. - What'd you take?
###211 Nothing.
###213 What'd you take?
###215 Newbie. Come.
###217 <i>Now I think about it I'm psyched</i> <i>to have Dr Cox do my evaluation,</i>
###221 <i>It'll be a chance to see</i> <i>what he thinks of me,</i>
###223 Look, Doogie, l'm up to my cha-chas in busywork,
###227 so l'm gonna take a rain check on your report card
###230 and have you do it yourself.
###234 You didn't even fill out my name.
###236 Well, now, l think it's John, or Jimmy or Ji or hmm.
###240 lt's in the J family.
###242 But if you get in trouble, just ask the nurses for help.
###248 Sir, l've been the hospital's legal counsel for,
###251 well, let's just say, when l started, l had hair.
###256 And a wife and family.
###259 The point is, l'll never get a raise
###261 without support of senior staff like yourself.
###264 - Can't do it. - Well, you did what you could.
###269 Dr Dorian, how are you?
###271 - These evaluations... - Just a pleasantry, keep it moving.
###274 Listen, all the publicity you and your friend have been getting,
###279 it would be silly not to milk it a little bit.
###281 See if we can't promote the hospital, what do you say?
###288 OK, whose breasts haven't l signed yet?
###292 - lt could happen. - Excuse me?
###294 Anything for the hospital.
###296 - So what are we doing tonight? - Go out to dinner, l guess.
###300 Dinner! Where are we gonna eat?
###301 - Don't know, some restaurant. - Some restaurant!
###306 Be honest... Does this look hip enough?
###310 Since when are khakis, a pink shirt and a neckerchief not hip?
###313 True.
###317 - Hi. - Hey, Darryl.
###319 l have to make a quick call. So, Patricia, Darryl, this is Elliot.
###324 - Hi. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.
###327 - l'm gonna get out of here. - OK.
###329 Thanks for the ride.
###331 - Someone's a cradle-robber. - Darryl's my son.
###334 The only way he could be your son was if you had him when you were 1 5.
###338 1 4.
###341 l was close.
###342 l'm sorry, that was my mom. l'm gonna have to cancel.
###347 <i>I can't evaluate myself,</i>
###349 Would you describe me as warm, professional, or both?
###352 l'd describe you as ''l'm on my lunch.''
###355 l don't know whether to be easy or hard on myself...
###358 Can't you see l'm watching my stories?
###361 <i>I can't honey</i> <i>Parker wants me to assist,</i>
###366 Dr Cox. Have you been here the whole time?
###368 No, l just came in through the couch door. Move.
###372 You said you were too busy to do my evaluation.
###375 l am.
###377 Didn't her daddy sell the coalmine?
###380 - Contract didn't stick. - That's interesting.
###386 We're almost ready. Anything you wanna say before we get started?
###390 Yeah, l've got something to say to Dr Cox.
###393 l'm gonna give you the best damn evaluation that you ever did see.
###398 And this Friday, at the Steel Cage Medi-Slam,
###402 l'm gonna give you a physical you ain't never gonna forget.
###407 l'm gonna probe ya, cos l'm The lntern.
###412 Nothing. OK, l'll be right back.
###415 She is tasty. Watch me work a cat and mouse game with her.
###420 She's married to the soundman.
###422 That thing clipped to your collar, that's a microphone.
###426 l'm so sorry. And l love ZZ Top.
###432 l'm not looking forward to this.
###434 OK, we're rolling. So, how's my cameraman doing?
###437 Good enough that he asked me for mouth-to-mouth again.
###442 Dr Turk, are there any specific challenges
###444 being a young black doctor in an inner city hospital?
###450 l wanna hear this. ls it possible to turn up the volume?
###454 That's as high as it goes.
###467 Listen, let me tell you what happened.
###477 Damn.
###478 When l saw that it was missing, did you not think l'd come to you?
###483 l don't know what you're talking about.
###486 So you're gonna play it that way, huh?
###489 Touché.
###496 - l finished my evaluation. - Great.
###499 l thought it would take longer so the marching band won't be here until later.
###503 Enjoy. l think you'll find it's a good read.
###506 Hey, Newbie. This thing actually does matter,
###508 so were you completely honest with yourself?
###511 Yeah.
###514 Say it right into the camera, hotshot.
###518 Now you can have this thing back any time you want.
###522 You're gonna have to bark like a dog, though.
###525 l'm not gonna bark like...
###528 lt's your call.
###531 Woof.
###533 Good boy.
###534 <i>At the very least I'm gonna end today</i> <i>on a good note,</i>
###537 l got something to show you.
###539 ls this an uncomfortable moment that'll change our friendship?
###543 No, no. You're going to like it.
###545 Good, cos l need some good news, man.
###548 Can you believe that news lady? ''What's it like to be a black doctor?''
###552 l just wish this was over.
###557 Why have we stopped?
###582 Roll 'em up
###596 Why do you think l wanna be a part of this?
###598 Kelso said it would make us role models. l just assumed...
###602 Everybody assumes that l'm a good athlete,
###605 or that l grew up poor, or that l love <i>Sanford and Son,</i>
###607 But you do love <i>Sanford And Son,</i>
###611 We both do.
###622 That's what l'm talking about.
###642 lf Dr Kelso wants me to be a role model for the community
###645 because l'm a great doctor, great. l will sign on the dotted line.
###649 But that's not what this is about.
###651 All my life l've been singled out because l'm black.
###655 - l didn't enter the contest! - Smile for the picture.
###660 - Remember our college brochure? - They put you on the cover.
###664 Twice?
###667 lt's different this time, now it's both of us.
###685 You can still see my hand on your shoulder.
###688 <i>That's when I realised I'm not gonna</i> <i>let people take advantage of me,</i>
###692 This is unfair. You're supposed to do my evaluation.
###695 And you know what? You're gonna do it, buddy boy.
###698 Buddy boy?
###700 Why, l oughta...
###702 - l'm serious. - Relax, Newbie.
###704 lt's just an evaluation, it should be easy.
###707 lf it's that easy, it won't take you long to do it.
###710 All right, don't worry about it, Newbie. l'll evaluate the hell right out of you.
###714 - When? - The second l get off work.
###718 - Fine! - Fine.
###719 Great! Here it is.
###723 - You get off, like, six-ish, or...? - Danger.
###734 You're gonna have to see her eventually.
###737 No. l know the layout to the air-duct system like the back of my hand.
###742 Of course l'm gonna have to see her again.
###745 So this is the part where it's my fault?
###748 Turk, if you could have seen the look on her face...
###751 lf l think about it again, it's gonna make me cry.
###755 What am l gonna do?
###757 Keep doing what you're doing. Eventually, she'll quit and move.
###760 - Why am l talking to you? - What?!
###762 You're such a guy.
###764 You can't understand something this deep on any real emotional level.
###768 l'm sorry about the poster. lt was racially insensitive.
###772 l should've been aware of your feelings.
###774 There's never been an issue of race between us.
###777 You've been nothing but a friend to me.
###779 - l love you, man. - Hit me one.
###784 Keep it real.
###785 We've got some things to work out but we'll get there.
###790 We'll get there.
###793 Sure, it hurt. But you know what? l'm not gonna wallow in self pity.
###798 Right after work, l'm gonna go downtown and just tear it up.
###803 Maybe l'll have a cigarette, just get a little crazy,
###806 and head wherever the night takes me.
###811 What's that, now?
###820 Thanks so much!
###836 Taxi!
###837 Hey, baby, how much?
###839 Hey, don't go away, man!
###841 Get me the hell outta here. Hurry!
###849 Here's what we're gonna do.
###851 l'm gonna leave the cart in the closet and leave the closet unlocked.
###855 lf, by magic, it should happen to reappear, l won't ask any questions.
###860 l don't even know what ''it'' is.
###862 Then why take it?
###867 Well, if it isn't Dr Turk, the friendly face of Sacred Heart.
###872 Yeah.
###873 Dr Kelso, about these posters... They're making me uncomfortable.
###878 l'm so sorry. l didn't realise you felt that way.
###883 Well, here's what l'm gonna do... l'm gonna leave them up.
###887 l can live with that. Or l can sue you.
###894 Dr Turk, you are an employee here. l can advertise however l wish.
###900 l can use your image, your name,
###903 l can manufacture tiny little Dr Turk action figures.
###906 lt'll cost $1 2.95. When you pull the string, it says:
###909 ''l don't like these posters!''
###911 - lsn't that right, Ted? - Definitely, sir.
###914 You'd certainly be vulnerable from a legal standpoint.
###917 How vulnerable?
###919 That lawsuit would be over so quickly, bring cab fare to the courthouse,
###923 since Dr Turk will be driving your Beamer home to his place.
###929 Hippie.
###932 God, that felt good.
###934 Who's the man?
###937 - ls it me? - Damn right it's you.
###942 Right, man.
###946 lt's me.
###960 Elliot... There's no excuse for what l did.
###964 No, there's not.
###968 - Are we done? - l'm really sorry.
###971 Don't be. lf l was going out with my friend l wouldn't invite you.
###977 Yes, l would. She'd like you better and neither of you would talk to me again.
###982 l only did it because l hadn't seen Patricia in a long time.
###986 You did it cos l don't fit in with you and your friend.
###989 lt's no surprise. lt's not like l've ever fit in anywhere.
###993 Carla, your friend Patricia's here. There's a problem with her son.
###1001 Why so sad, Marshmallow?
###1005 <i>Stay calm</i> <i>stay calm stay calm,</i>
###1009 <i>Oh good, He's not here,</i>
###1012 Dr Cox?
###1017 lt's time. Sit down.
###1021 What do you want me to say? That you're great?
###1025 That you're raising the bar for interns everywhere?
###1028 l'm cool with that.
###1030 l'm not gonna say that. You're OK.
###1033 You might be better than that some day but now all l see is
###1036 a guy worried about what everybody thinks of him
###1039 that he has no real belief in himself.
###1041 l mean, did you even wonder why l told you to do your own evaluation?
###1048 l can't think of a safe answer, l just...
###1050 Clam up!
###1052 l wanted you to think about yourself.
###1055 And l mean really think.
###1057 What are you good at? What do you suck at? l wanted it down on paper,
###1061 not so l could see it, or anybody else, but so that you could see it.
###1066 Ultimately, you don't have to answer to me, or to Kelso,
###1069 you don't even have to answer to your patients, for God's sake.
###1072 You only have to answer to one guy, Newbie, and that's you!
###1080 There...
###1082 You are... evaluated.
###1089 Get the hell outta my sight.
###1091 You, honest to God, get me so angry l'm afraid l might hurt myself.
###1100 So what are you? One of the male nurses?
###1102 Actually, l'm a surgeon. l'm doing this as a favour for Carla.
###1106 Carla is fine. What's she doing with you?
###1109 Slummin' a little, God bless her heart.
###1112 This is a knife cut, huh?
###1114 Yeah, it's cool.
###1116 See this right here? Pinched it in a door. Two stitches.
###1121 - Oh, man. You hardcore, man. - Hell, yeah!
###1125 Darryl's gonna be fine but l'm worried about you.
###1128 You're upset. l'll set you up in a room with some fluids and a Valium.
###1131 - Elliot, thank you. - There you are.
###1135 Elliot, you're coming, right?
###1137 - ln a sec. - Are you all right?
###1140 <i>It's funny how our perceptions</i> <i>can be so off,</i>

###1181 and his determination to always be better
###1183 is something l see in him 24 hours a day.

###1189 But he's definitely somebody you don't want to lose.

###1196 You all get paid too much for doing nothing.
###1199 Oh, good, Newbie. You found a specialty.
###1202 No, l just dropped my pen.
