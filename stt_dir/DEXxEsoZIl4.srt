1
0:0:2,0 --> 0:0:6,1
Is there a supernatural
dimension?


2
0:0:6,1 --> 0:0:10,567
a world beyond the one we know?


3
0:0:10,567 --> 0:0:15,167
Is there life after death?


4
0:0:15,167 --> 0:0:18,733
Do angels exist?


5
0:0:18,733 --> 0:0:24,767
Can our dreams contain messages
from Heaven?


6
0:0:24,767 --> 0:0:30,5
Can we tap into ancient secrets
of the supernatural?


7
0:0:30,5 --> 0:0:32,833
Are healing miracles real?


8
0:0:32,833 --> 0:0:38,367
Sid Roth has spent over 35 years
researching the strange world of


9
0:0:38,367 --> 0:0:41,733
the supernatural.


10
0:0:41,733 --> 0:0:50,867
Join Sid for this edition of
It's Supernatural!


11
0:0:50,867 --> 0:0:53,33
Sid: Hello.


12
0:0:53,33 --> 0:0:54,0
Sid Roth here.


13
0:0:54,0 --> 0:0:58,567
Welcome to my world where it's
naturally supernatural.


14
0:0:58,567 --> 0:1:2,567
I'm so excited about this show.


15
0:1:2,567 --> 0:1:9,533
My guest is going to teach you
the missing message of Jesus.


16
0:1:9,533 --> 0:1:11,2
It's there.


17
0:1:11,2 --> 0:1:13,2
It is in the Gospels.


18
0:1:13,2 --> 0:1:21,6
But it's missing today, and that
is Jesus came to heal the broken


19
0:1:21,6 --> 0:1:22,633
hearted.


20
0:1:22,633 --> 0:1:28,233
And you see, you can't get
everything God promises to you


21
0:1:28,233 --> 0:1:29,933
if you have a broken heart.


22
0:1:29,933 --> 0:1:33,9
And it's my conviction in a
broken world with a broken


23
0:1:33,9 --> 0:1:38,3
devil, with broken people, how
do you expect to have a healed


24
0:1:38,3 --> 0:1:46,7
heart unless Jesus heals your
heart.


25
0:1:46,7 --> 0:1:52,667
Now have you ever felt that
something is wrong and you don't


26
0:1:52,667 --> 0:1:53,633
know what it is.


27
0:1:53,633 --> 0:1:55,367
What a frustrating feeling.


28
0:1:55,367 --> 0:1:58,4
That's what happened to my
friend John McTernan.


29
0:1:58,4 --> 0:2:1,3
John, what was going on in your
life?


30
0:2:1,3 --> 0:2:2,3
You're a believer.


31
0:2:2,3 --> 0:2:4,333
You're speaking before people.


32
0:2:4,333 --> 0:2:9,467
You're not supposed to have a
problem, but you do.


33
0:2:9,467 --> 0:2:10,267
What's your problem?


34
0:2:10,267 --> 0:2:13,9
John: Sid, it's internal and
it's kind of hard to explain.


35
0:2:13,9 --> 0:2:15,833
But I felt a drag side.


36
0:2:15,833 --> 0:2:20,5
I felt like a car going down the
road on the interstate at 65


37
0:2:20,5 --> 0:2:24,667
miles an hour at all sorts of
power, speed, and yet it was


38
0:2:24,667 --> 0:2:25,867
holding back.


39
0:2:25,867 --> 0:2:28,1
There was a power drain inside
of me.


40
0:2:28,1 --> 0:2:28,867
I could feel it.


41
0:2:28,867 --> 0:2:30,367
I knew something was wrong.


42
0:2:30,367 --> 0:2:34,867
I had brought it before the Lord
for many, many years, and it


43
0:2:34,867 --> 0:2:36,67
just sat there.


44
0:2:36,67 --> 0:2:37,367
It didn't go.


45
0:2:37,367 --> 0:2:38,433
I had no idea what it was.


46
0:2:38,433 --> 0:2:39,567
Sid: Okay.


47
0:2:39,567 --> 0:2:43,533
So one day he's minding his own
business, listening to a radio


48
0:2:43,533 --> 0:2:46,333
program and the light bulb went
on.


49
0:2:46,333 --> 0:2:47,133
What happened?


50
0:2:47,133 --> 0:2:50,267
John: There was a woman being
interviewed about, she was a


51
0:2:50,267 --> 0:2:53,967
psychologist, Christian
psychologist, and she's being


52
0:2:53,967 --> 0:2:59,367
interviewed by her research on
children of divorce and how


53
0:2:59,367 --> 0:3:2,2
every one of them, virtually
every one of them had a broken


54
0:3:2,2 --> 0:3:6,833
heart, and it affected them
where the developed loneliness.


55
0:3:6,833 --> 0:3:11,267
That was an outstanding trait of
a broken heart of a child from a


56
0:3:11,267 --> 0:3:12,167
divorced family.


57
0:3:12,167 --> 0:3:15,1
And it was like, bingo, my
parents were divorced.


58
0:3:15,1 --> 0:3:17,467
I didn't even know them
together.


59
0:3:17,467 --> 0:3:19,1
They were divorced before I
could remember.


60
0:3:19,1 --> 0:3:23,767
And I began to think, and I'm
saying, broken heart, maybe


61
0:3:23,767 --> 0:3:25,233
that's what I have.


62
0:3:25,233 --> 0:3:30,133
And I sought the Lord about it,
and I prayed, and at that point,


63
0:3:30,133 --> 0:3:31,967
I didn't know I had a broken
heart.


64
0:3:31,967 --> 0:3:36,733
And if you, Sid, had come to me
like let's say years before that


65
0:3:36,733 --> 0:3:38,667
and you said, "John, I didn't
know you had a broken heart," I


66
0:3:38,667 --> 0:3:40,0
would go, how?


67
0:3:40,0 --> 0:3:41,767
How would it be broken?


68
0:3:41,767 --> 0:3:44,0
I had no idea at all.


69
0:3:44,0 --> 0:3:46,967
And when I sought the Lord Sid:
You know, I'm reminded the Bible


70
0:3:46,967 --> 0:3:50,633
says, "The heart is the most
deceitful thing."


71
0:3:50,633 --> 0:3:56,367
Here he is a believer with a
broken heart and he's so


72
0:3:56,367 --> 0:4:0,367
programmed to operate with that
broken heart he doesn't even


73
0:4:0,367 --> 0:4:1,767
know it's broken.


74
0:4:1,767 --> 0:4:2,667
John: That's exactly right, Sid.


75
0:4:2,667 --> 0:4:3,667
That's exactly right.


76
0:4:3,667 --> 0:4:5,567
So I knew Luke 4:18.


77
0:4:5,567 --> 0:4:9,7
And in Luke 4:18, that is the
ministry of Jesus Christ.


78
0:4:9,7 --> 0:4:13,33
And we all know that he came to
save us from sin.


79
0:4:13,33 --> 0:4:13,767
Right?


80
0:4:13,767 --> 0:4:14,667
Sid: Of course.


81
0:4:14,667 --> 0:4:16,133
John: But it doesn't end there.


82
0:4:16,133 --> 0:4:20,167
When you look at Luke 4:18, it
says, "And he came to heal the


83
0:4:20,167 --> 0:4:23,933
broken hearted, to deliver the
captives, to open the eyes of


84
0:4:23,933 --> 0:4:27,267
the blind and to set at liberty
them that are bruised."


85
0:4:27,267 --> 0:4:30,633
We stop right at the salvation
message.


86
0:4:30,633 --> 0:4:33,967
But if you look in the Bible,
there's a semi-colon, and right


87
0:4:33,967 --> 0:4:36,933
after it, it says, "The Lord
came to heal the broken


88
0:4:36,933 --> 0:4:37,8
hearted."


89
0:4:37,8 --> 0:4:40,4
Sid: There are many other areas
that some have had a broken


90
0:4:40,4 --> 0:4:41,5
heart of.


91
0:4:41,5 --> 0:4:43,9
I mean, a divorced home, that's
enough.


92
0:4:43,9 --> 0:4:46,333
But there are a lot of other
areas, like what?


93
0:4:46,333 --> 0:4:49,567
John: Sid, rejection, especially
with children.


94
0:4:49,567 --> 0:4:54,733
I have come to see it's much
easier than we realize to break


95
0:4:54,733 --> 0:4:55,5
a child's heart.


96
0:4:55,5 --> 0:4:59,67
Their heart is very tender and
it's very easy to break a


97
0:4:59,67 --> 0:5:0,67
child's heart.


98
0:5:0,67 --> 0:5:3,1
But rejection, death.


99
0:5:3,1 --> 0:5:5,533
Death can really break a heart.


100
0:5:5,533 --> 0:5:10,1
I have found with women,
abortion, devastating with


101
0:5:10,1 --> 0:5:11,267
breaking the heart.


102
0:5:11,267 --> 0:5:15,933
Physical abuse, sexual abuse,
the military with men, women in


103
0:5:15,933 --> 0:5:17,367
the military now also.


104
0:5:17,367 --> 0:5:20,867
But that, what they see and what
happens can break their heart.


105
0:5:20,867 --> 0:5:27,3
We call it like post-stress, you
know, the trauma and much of


106
0:5:27,3 --> 0:5:29,6
that is really a broken heart.


107
0:5:29,6 --> 0:5:30,2
Sid: But you know what?


108
0:5:30,2 --> 0:5:34,6
Just the peer pressure of a
young child going to school and


109
0:5:34,6 --> 0:5:37,7
maybe they're not so pretty, and
maybe they hear someone laughing


110
0:5:37,7 --> 0:5:39,433
at them, they say nothing.


111
0:5:39,433 --> 0:5:43,3
But in a child's mind, that's
enough to do it.


112
0:5:43,3 --> 0:5:46,967
So what was the revelation you
had when you started praying?


113
0:5:46,967 --> 0:5:47,967
John: My mother had remarried.


114
0:5:47,967 --> 0:5:52,33
Now there is no way on my own I
could remember this, because


115
0:5:52,33 --> 0:5:54,6
we're going back now to when I
was six years old.


116
0:5:54,6 --> 0:6:0,67
And my stepfather, I don't
think, I know he didn't do this


117
0:6:0,67 --> 0:6:1,267
to be malicious.


118
0:6:1,267 --> 0:6:5,67
But he approached when I was
about six years old about being


119
0:6:5,67 --> 0:6:7,667
adopted, and I had no idea what
he was talking about.


120
0:6:7,667 --> 0:6:9,633
Sid: You thought he was your
natural father?


121
0:6:9,633 --> 0:6:11,233
John: No, no.


122
0:6:11,233 --> 0:6:14,3
I had, my father would come and
visit me, and he was a good


123
0:6:14,3 --> 0:6:15,1
friend.


124
0:6:15,1 --> 0:6:16,167
I knew him as Joe.


125
0:6:16,167 --> 0:6:18,0
I didn't call him Dad or
anything.


126
0:6:18,0 --> 0:6:19,0
I knew him as Joe.


127
0:6:19,0 --> 0:6:24,433
And my stepfather wanted to
block out my father from coming,


128
0:6:24,433 --> 0:6:26,767
and he talked to me about
adoption.


129
0:6:26,767 --> 0:6:28,233
I had no idea what he was
talking about.


130
0:6:28,233 --> 0:6:30,267
Finally, it dawned on me.


131
0:6:30,267 --> 0:6:34,733
I had like a revelation that Joe
was my father and this man was


132
0:6:34,733 --> 0:6:35,567
my stepfather.


133
0:6:35,567 --> 0:6:41,233
And I remember I said to him...
Child: When my name change, can


134
0:6:41,233 --> 0:6:44,33
I still see Joe?


135
0:6:44,33 --> 0:6:46,9
Man No, you'll have my name.


136
0:6:46,9 --> 0:6:48,0
Child: No.


137
0:6:48,0 --> 0:6:51,467
My name John McTernan.


138
0:6:51,467 --> 0:6:54,33
John: And I knew right then and
there the whole thing opened up.


139
0:6:54,33 --> 0:6:58,6
I understood perfectly at six
years old and I knew if I told


140
0:6:58,6 --> 0:7:2,267
my father he would protect me
from what was going on.


141
0:7:2,267 --> 0:7:6,0
It was a complete revelation,
but it broke my heart.


142
0:7:6,0 --> 0:7:7,333
Sid: Hold that thought.


143
0:7:7,333 --> 0:7:12,667
When we come back, we're going
to find out what God did that so


144
0:7:12,667 --> 0:7:18,233
changed his life, that people
don't even recognize him.


145
0:7:18,233 --> 0:7:23,267
He doesn't even recognize
himself after his heart is


146
0:7:23,267 --> 0:7:25,433
healed by God Himself.


147
0:7:25,433 --> 0:7:30,233
But better than that, how about
having your broken heart healed.


148
0:7:30,233 --> 0:7:34,267
Don't go away.


149
0:7:34,267 --> 0:8:9,733
We'll be right back to 
It's Supernatural!


150
0:8:9,733 --> 0:8:17,967
We now return to 
It's Supernatural!


151
0:8:17,967 --> 0:8:21,9
Sid: I mean, what a devastating
thing.


152
0:8:21,9 --> 0:8:27,533
A young boy, the one that's been
with him his whole life that he


153
0:8:27,533 --> 0:8:32,2
thinks is his father and he knew
his natural father, but he


154
0:8:32,2 --> 0:8:34,167
didn't know him as "father".


155
0:8:34,167 --> 0:8:38,5
And his father brings him, in
the basement and tells him the


156
0:8:38,5 --> 0:8:39,767
truth.


157
0:8:39,767 --> 0:8:40,6
How old were you?


158
0:8:40,6 --> 0:8:41,9
John: I figured about six.


159
0:8:41,9 --> 0:8:44,733
Sid: At six, what affect did it
have on you?


160
0:8:44,733 --> 0:8:48,133
John: From that moment on I did
not want to live with my mother


161
0:8:48,133 --> 0:8:49,367
and my stepfather.


162
0:8:49,367 --> 0:8:50,7
I wanted to be with my dad.


163
0:8:50,7 --> 0:8:54,833
And it brought in, it developed
that spirit of loneliness was


164
0:8:54,833 --> 0:8:55,933
deep with me.


165
0:8:55,933 --> 0:8:59,867
I had, it was a supernatural
spiritual loneliness.


166
0:8:59,867 --> 0:9:1,7
It brought a feeling of
rejection in.


167
0:9:1,7 --> 0:9:5,933
It actually brought fear into me
because I remember I was afraid


168
0:9:5,933 --> 0:9:8,167
he would try that again.


169
0:9:8,167 --> 0:9:12,267
And I never was, from that day
on, I was never comfortable in


170
0:9:12,267 --> 0:9:13,133
the family.


171
0:9:13,133 --> 0:9:17,67
And it devastated me inside as a
little six year old.


172
0:9:17,67 --> 0:9:18,933
And that was that problem.


173
0:9:18,933 --> 0:9:23,267
It broke my heart at six and it
carried over when I came to


174
0:9:23,267 --> 0:9:25,233
believe in the Lord Jesus
Christ.


175
0:9:25,233 --> 0:9:26,67
Sid: Okay.


176
0:9:26,67 --> 0:9:30,9
You have the revelation that you
have a broken heart.


177
0:9:30,9 --> 0:9:34,467
You now realize when it
happened.


178
0:9:34,467 --> 0:9:35,1
John: Yes.


179
0:9:35,1 --> 0:9:36,133
Sid: You know exactly.


180
0:9:36,133 --> 0:9:37,367
What did you do about it?


181
0:9:37,367 --> 0:9:39,767
John: I cried out to the Lord to
heal my heart.


182
0:9:39,767 --> 0:9:44,367
And Sid, it took me with the
Lord about two or three weeks of


183
0:9:44,367 --> 0:9:45,5
prayer.


184
0:9:45,5 --> 0:9:49,4
And I can remember laying in bed
at night with tears rolling down


185
0:9:49,4 --> 0:9:55,5
out of my eyes with this feeling
of loneliness and emptiness, and


186
0:9:55,5 --> 0:10:0,367
it got to the point where I
realized then that I know why a


187
0:10:0,367 --> 0:10:5,933
spouse will die like within a
year after a spouse passes away.


188
0:10:5,933 --> 0:10:7,7
Sid: I've noticed that pattern.


189
0:10:7,7 --> 0:10:11,2
John: That loneliness, that's
what I actually felt.


190
0:10:11,2 --> 0:10:12,9
It felt like I was dying.


191
0:10:12,9 --> 0:10:14,133
That's how severe it was.


192
0:10:14,133 --> 0:10:18,133
And then I cried out and I said,
"Lord, if I die over this then I


193
0:10:18,133 --> 0:10:21,533
go to be with you, but I'm
staying and I'm believing you're


194
0:10:21,533 --> 0:10:22,5
going to heal my heart."


195
0:10:22,5 --> 0:10:24,4
And literally, I could feel
relief.


196
0:10:24,4 --> 0:10:27,333
It like came like that.


197
0:10:27,333 --> 0:10:29,267
It just came like up and out.


198
0:10:29,267 --> 0:10:31,567
Sid: It sounds easy, John.


199
0:10:31,567 --> 0:10:34,367
John: Well those two weeks,
three weeks leading up to it,


200
0:10:34,367 --> 0:10:36,267
for me, was not easy.


201
0:10:36,267 --> 0:10:37,867
But the Lord delivered.


202
0:10:37,867 --> 0:10:40,67
I began a whole new man.


203
0:10:40,67 --> 0:10:43,867
That emergency brake feeling
came off.


204
0:10:43,867 --> 0:10:48,333
Sid: But what about that fear,
the loneliness, the loneliness


205
0:10:48,333 --> 0:10:51,433
you explained, the rejection,
what about those things?


206
0:10:51,433 --> 0:10:55,4
John: I began to see how I
operated in my life.


207
0:10:55,4 --> 0:10:59,567
One of the healing, one of the
ministries of Jesus Christ is to


208
0:10:59,567 --> 0:11:1,8
open the eyes of the blind.


209
0:11:1,8 --> 0:11:6,133
And all of a sudden I began to
see like now that my heart was


210
0:11:6,133 --> 0:11:11,233
healed actions that I did to
protect that heart, and also the


211
0:11:11,233 --> 0:11:14,867
way I interacted with people
with the fear of rejection and


212
0:11:14,867 --> 0:11:17,2
not wanting to be rejected, and
things I said, and things.


213
0:11:17,2 --> 0:11:20,133
There was a whole complete
revelation and I began to


214
0:11:20,133 --> 0:11:24,633
confess it to the Lord and say,
"Lord, I'm not living with fear


215
0:11:24,633 --> 0:11:25,3
anymore."


216
0:11:25,3 --> 0:11:26,8
I didn't even know it was there.


217
0:11:26,8 --> 0:11:30,3
Sid: I heard a man once say, God
never sets you free of your


218
0:11:30,3 --> 0:11:31,67
friends.


219
0:11:31,67 --> 0:11:32,967
He sets you free of your
enemies.


220
0:11:32,967 --> 0:11:37,33
And he had no idea there was an
enemy called fear.


221
0:11:37,33 --> 0:11:39,167
But this is the amazing thing.


222
0:11:39,167 --> 0:11:45,933
Once the heart is restored then
these other critters that are


223
0:11:45,933 --> 0:11:48,867
enemies, they literally have to
go.


224
0:11:48,867 --> 0:11:49,4
John: That's right.


225
0:11:49,4 --> 0:11:50,967
Sid: It's so wonderful.


226
0:11:50,967 --> 0:11:56,3
But tell me when the Bible talks
about the ministry of Jesus was


227
0:11:56,3 --> 0:12:1,433
to restore the broken hearted,
what does the word "broken" mean


228
0:12:1,433 --> 0:12:2,2
in Hebrew?


229
0:12:2,2 --> 0:12:3,333
John: That's a real good
question.


230
0:12:3,333 --> 0:12:5,867
And it's actually Hebrew and
Greek really mean the same


231
0:12:5,867 --> 0:12:6,6
thing.


232
0:12:6,6 --> 0:12:9,167
It means a violent shattering.


233
0:12:9,167 --> 0:12:10,733
There's the word "violent".


234
0:12:10,733 --> 0:12:14,867
And it's like you have like this
glass here and I took it and I


235
0:12:14,867 --> 0:12:17,833
just didn't drop it, but I threw
it down on the ground.


236
0:12:17,833 --> 0:12:19,7
Sid: There would be no way to
restore that.


237
0:12:19,7 --> 0:12:23,2
John: It splinters apart and
that is what the Bible describes


238
0:12:23,2 --> 0:12:24,367
as a broken heart.


239
0:12:24,367 --> 0:12:29,3
And Sid, there is nothing human
on this earth that can heal a


240
0:12:29,3 --> 0:12:30,67
broken heart.


241
0:12:30,67 --> 0:12:32,967
It can only be, it's
supernatural, it can only be


242
0:12:32,967 --> 0:12:34,767
healed by Jesus Christ.


243
0:12:34,767 --> 0:12:36,2
That's his ministry.


244
0:12:36,2 --> 0:12:42,367
Sid: Tell me about the woman
with ulcerated colitis.


245
0:12:42,367 --> 0:12:47,0
John: Well what happened, Sid,
is when my heart was healed, all


246
0:12:47,0 --> 0:12:52,3
of a sudden I would come in
contact with people and in my


247
0:12:52,3 --> 0:12:56,333
mind I would hear, I would look
at you for example and I'd hear


248
0:12:56,333 --> 0:12:57,967
"broken hearted, broken
hearted".


249
0:12:57,967 --> 0:13:2,167
And I would go up to you very
politely, I just didn't yell at


250
0:13:2,167 --> 0:13:2,9
you.


251
0:13:2,9 --> 0:13:6,533
I'd say, "Excuse me, but I
believe the Lord is telling me


252
0:13:6,533 --> 0:13:7,6
you have a broken heart."


253
0:13:7,6 --> 0:13:10,6
And people would start crying
and it was amazing.


254
0:13:10,6 --> 0:13:13,8
The Lord is putting people
across my path who need to be


255
0:13:13,8 --> 0:13:15,0
ministered to.


256
0:13:15,0 --> 0:13:19,833
So this ministry started to
develop, just happened when I'd


257
0:13:19,833 --> 0:13:21,567
see instant results.


258
0:13:21,567 --> 0:13:24,567
Sometimes the results would take
a while, but instant results.


259
0:13:24,567 --> 0:13:28,5
And this one woman had a
powerful spirit of rejection.


260
0:13:28,5 --> 0:13:31,733
It happened when she was about
five or six years old, just like


261
0:13:31,733 --> 0:13:36,7
you mentioned, rejected by kids,
and all her life this rejection


262
0:13:36,7 --> 0:13:38,0
just continued.


263
0:13:38,0 --> 0:13:42,3
She had two husbands that left
her and they liked divorced her


264
0:13:42,3 --> 0:13:45,367
on a Friday, and then married
another woman on a Monday.


265
0:13:45,367 --> 0:13:50,967
And that, she was just, she had
a like self-hatred of herself.


266
0:13:50,967 --> 0:13:55,433
And when I ministered to her
about the broken heart it was


267
0:13:55,433 --> 0:13:59,7
very hard for her to receive
that God loved her because of


268
0:13:59,7 --> 0:14:0,467
her broken heart.


269
0:14:0,467 --> 0:14:3,233
Even though she believed in the
Lord, I know that this sounds


270
0:14:3,233 --> 0:14:5,733
weird, but that's what happens
with a broken heart.


271
0:14:5,733 --> 0:14:7,133
Jesus was her savior.


272
0:14:7,133 --> 0:14:12,233
But the reality of calling God,
Abba Father, she couldn't do it.


273
0:14:12,233 --> 0:14:13,733
She said, "I can't do it."


274
0:14:13,733 --> 0:14:15,267
It took a couple prayer
sessions.


275
0:14:15,267 --> 0:14:21,167
And she ulcerated colitis where
about four or five years she was


276
0:14:21,167 --> 0:14:22,333
in the final stage of it.


277
0:14:22,333 --> 0:14:23,133
I mean, it was critical.


278
0:14:23,133 --> 0:14:24,867
She was anemic, bleeding
severely.


279
0:14:24,867 --> 0:14:30,533
Finally, she broke through with
Abba Father, her heart was


280
0:14:30,533 --> 0:14:33,833
healed and that point my
ministry, now what I do is if


281
0:14:33,833 --> 0:14:37,667
someone has physical issues,
when I pray with them for a


282
0:14:37,667 --> 0:14:40,7
broken heart, we also pray for
the physical issue.


283
0:14:40,7 --> 0:14:44,567
Because a lot of times the
physical issue is caused by the


284
0:14:44,567 --> 0:14:49,1
broken heart, the fear and
anxiety, and tension.


285
0:14:49,1 --> 0:14:54,33
So we prayed and her ulcerated
intestines were healed right


286
0:14:54,33 --> 0:14:55,633
there on the spot.


287
0:14:55,633 --> 0:14:59,33
Sid: Once the heart is healed,
the emotions get healed.


288
0:14:59,33 --> 0:15:0,867
The physical body gets healed.


289
0:15:0,867 --> 0:15:1,4
John: Yes.


290
0:15:1,4 --> 0:15:4,933
Sid: John has even gone into
mental institutions in hopeless


291
0:15:4,933 --> 0:15:5,933
cases.


292
0:15:5,933 --> 0:15:9,133
One of the most hopeless cases
they had in a mental institution


293
0:15:9,133 --> 0:15:12,8
was her heart was healed, she
was healed.


294
0:15:12,8 --> 0:15:18,833
But I'll tell you what, I want
you to pray a supernatural


295
0:15:18,833 --> 0:15:21,2
prayer with John, because this
is what he found out.


296
0:15:21,2 --> 0:15:22,533
The gift is growing.


297
0:15:22,533 --> 0:15:24,5
The same thing happened with me.


298
0:15:24,5 --> 0:15:27,767
I started laying hands on people
and they got physically healed.


299
0:15:27,767 --> 0:15:31,833
Then I started speaking it, not
even laying hands, and they got


300
0:15:31,833 --> 0:15:34,333
just as healed.


301
0:15:34,333 --> 0:15:39,8
I'll have him pray for you when
we come back.


302
0:15:39,8 --> 0:17:13,8
We'll be right back to
It's Supernatural!


303
0:17:13,8 --> 0:17:22,667
We now return to
It's Supernatural!


304
0:17:22,667 --> 0:17:28,6
Sid: Now we find out in the
Bible amazing supernatural


305
0:17:28,6 --> 0:17:32,267
blessings that God has given to
Abraham.


306
0:17:32,267 --> 0:17:38,3
But there's a tie-in between a
heart being broken and receiving


307
0:17:38,3 --> 0:17:41,233
these supernatural blessings.


308
0:17:41,233 --> 0:17:45,3
There is, like with John, there
is a disconnect and many people


309
0:17:45,3 --> 0:17:46,867
don't understand this.


310
0:17:46,867 --> 0:17:48,67
Explain that.


311
0:17:48,67 --> 0:17:52,633
John: When our heart is healed,
it puts us in a new relationship


312
0:17:52,633 --> 0:17:53,9
with God.


313
0:17:53,9 --> 0:17:58,167
It's like when you have an
earthly father and you're afraid


314
0:17:58,167 --> 0:18:2,933
of him for whatever reason, you
shy back, you're afraid to talk


315
0:18:2,933 --> 0:18:4,433
to him, you're afraid to ask
him.


316
0:18:4,433 --> 0:18:7,5
Well with a broken heart, that
can carry over towards our


317
0:18:7,5 --> 0:18:8,333
attitude.


318
0:18:8,333 --> 0:18:10,8
And God tells us to call him
"Abba Father".


319
0:18:10,8 --> 0:18:14,567
And those attitudes towards an
earthly father, we can project


320
0:18:14,567 --> 0:18:15,8
towards God.


321
0:18:15,8 --> 0:18:17,267
But he's not like that towards
us.


322
0:18:17,267 --> 0:18:22,1
So a broken heart can break the
feeling, or block the feeling of


323
0:18:22,1 --> 0:18:25,867
how much God loves us, how much
He wants to bless us, and also


324
0:18:25,867 --> 0:18:30,367
the ministry of Lord Jesus is to
open the eyes of the blind.


325
0:18:30,367 --> 0:18:33,867
So once our heart is healed,
Sid, it's a progression.


326
0:18:33,867 --> 0:18:38,2
Salvation, healing of the heart,
setting the captives free,


327
0:18:38,2 --> 0:18:41,7
opening the eyes of the blind
and then setting at liberty them


328
0:18:41,7 --> 0:18:45,433
that are bruised, it's a
progression of what God does in


329
0:18:45,433 --> 0:18:46,2
our life.


330
0:18:46,2 --> 0:18:50,67
So when our heart is healed and
we're set free, all of a sudden


331
0:18:50,67 --> 0:18:55,4
there's no blockage between us
and Abba Father, and we believe


332
0:18:55,4 --> 0:18:57,267
that He'll bless us then.


333
0:18:57,267 --> 0:19:2,567
Sid: So very briefly, will you
tell me, I mean, John gets calls


334
0:19:2,567 --> 0:19:6,833
from people that have loved ones
in mental institutions.


335
0:19:6,833 --> 0:19:8,6
Tell me about one.


336
0:19:8,6 --> 0:19:12,133
John: A friend of mine asked me
to minister to his sister who


337
0:19:12,133 --> 0:19:15,767
was believer, and she has been
in and out of the psychiatric


338
0:19:15,767 --> 0:19:17,333
ward for severe depression.


339
0:19:17,333 --> 0:19:21,533
She had been there, she's in her
60's, she had been in there now


340
0:19:21,533 --> 0:19:22,3
for three months.


341
0:19:22,3 --> 0:19:23,767
And didn't know she was in there
for three months.


342
0:19:23,767 --> 0:19:25,5
Sid: How bad was the depression?


343
0:19:25,5 --> 0:19:28,367
John: The doctor said it was the
worst he's ever seen.


344
0:19:28,367 --> 0:19:31,433
They were thinking of
permanently institutionalizing


345
0:19:31,433 --> 0:19:32,133
her.


346
0:19:32,133 --> 0:19:35,4
When I visited her and I looked
at her, Sid, if you could see


347
0:19:35,4 --> 0:19:37,5
depression, that was her.


348
0:19:37,5 --> 0:19:41,4
I mean, you could like cut it or
touch her with depression.


349
0:19:41,4 --> 0:19:43,1
And there's a Bible right next
to her.


350
0:19:43,1 --> 0:19:48,733
So I began to talk to her and
she said, "I've been prayed over


351
0:19:48,733 --> 0:19:52,333
and so many people prayed over
me, and I've gone to Christian


352
0:19:52,333 --> 0:19:53,4
psychologists."


353
0:19:53,4 --> 0:19:56,667
I said, "Did anyone ever pray
for you for a broken heart?"


354
0:19:56,667 --> 0:19:59,867
And she went like this and she
said, "No, never."


355
0:19:59,867 --> 0:20:1,3
I said, "That's the problem."


356
0:20:1,3 --> 0:20:2,433
Terry was her name.


357
0:20:2,433 --> 0:20:4,467
So we got into her background.


358
0:20:4,467 --> 0:20:8,33
When she was 16 years old she
had a child out of wedlock.


359
0:20:8,33 --> 0:20:13,233
The child died and it ruptured
her family, relationship with


360
0:20:13,233 --> 0:20:16,733
her family that destroyed her
inside, and she went on a path


361
0:20:16,733 --> 0:20:21,633
of rejection and depression into
the psychiatric ward.


362
0:20:21,633 --> 0:20:26,633
So we prayed and she forgave
what happened, she believed the


363
0:20:26,633 --> 0:20:29,433
baby died because of what she
did.


364
0:20:29,433 --> 0:20:32,733
Then she believed God punished
her by taking the baby.


365
0:20:32,733 --> 0:20:34,6
She had a grudge towards God.


366
0:20:34,6 --> 0:20:36,433
She had to forgive herself.


367
0:20:36,433 --> 0:20:38,633
She had to forgive her parents.


368
0:20:38,633 --> 0:20:43,733
When that all came and then we
prayed, Sid, the greatest, for


369
0:20:43,733 --> 0:20:47,567
me personally, I think miracle I
had ever seen, her continence


370
0:20:47,567 --> 0:20:51,967
changed.


371
0:20:51,967 --> 0:20:57,3
She had this glow to the point
where people in the psychiatric


372
0:20:57,3 --> 0:20:59,2
ward were saying to her, "What
happened to you?


373
0:20:59,2 --> 0:21:1,367
You look so different."


374
0:21:1,367 --> 0:21:4,533
My friend said to me, "You did
like a magic act.


375
0:21:4,533 --> 0:21:5,567
His name was John."


376
0:21:5,567 --> 0:21:7,1
I said, "What are you talking
about?"


377
0:21:7,1 --> 0:21:9,6
He said, "That's not my sister."


378
0:21:9,6 --> 0:21:12,5
He goes, "I don't know who she
is."


379
0:21:12,5 --> 0:21:14,667
He goes, "I've never seen
anything like this from the


380
0:21:14,667 --> 0:21:16,467
depression to the joy."


381
0:21:16,467 --> 0:21:20,333
And they released her from the
hospital, and she now is leading


382
0:21:20,333 --> 0:21:21,4
a normal life.


383
0:21:21,4 --> 0:21:25,233
The whole problem was a broken
heart.


384
0:21:25,233 --> 0:21:26,0
Sid: Okay.


385
0:21:26,0 --> 0:21:30,667
Will you pray as God instructs
for those that are watching,


386
0:21:30,667 --> 0:21:35,267
because I know that this is what
you've been crying out to God


387
0:21:35,267 --> 0:21:36,67
for.


388
0:21:36,67 --> 0:21:37,633
John: Yes.


389
0:21:37,633 --> 0:21:40,6
Father, we come before you in
the awesome name of Jesus.


390
0:21:40,6 --> 0:21:45,4
And Lord, we bring the listeners
before you and the key on their


391
0:21:45,4 --> 0:21:48,7
part is forgiveness, to forgive
those that broke their heart,


392
0:21:48,7 --> 0:21:53,633
forgive themselves and maybe
possibly we be reconciled with


393
0:21:53,633 --> 0:21:55,667
you from a grudge.


394
0:21:55,667 --> 0:21:59,667
Father, once that's done, I pray
now that in the name of Jesus


395
0:21:59,667 --> 0:22:4,767
you take that shattered, broken,
splintered heart and put it


396
0:22:4,767 --> 0:22:8,9
together, make it solid, make it
one according to your word, and


397
0:22:8,9 --> 0:22:13,933
bind it with the power and the
love of the Holy Spirit, never


398
0:22:13,933 --> 0:22:15,2
to be broken again.


399
0:22:15,2 --> 0:22:18,6
And bring the healing that comes
with that, Father, the healing


400
0:22:18,6 --> 0:22:23,633
from fear and depression, and
anxiety, and rejection where we


401
0:22:23,633 --> 0:22:27,4
can call you Abba Father and
walk in love with you.


402
0:22:27,4 --> 0:22:31,533
And then, Father, we ask for the
flow as the heart is healed,


403
0:22:31,533 --> 0:22:35,6
Lord, that issues like high
blood pressure, heart problems,


404
0:22:35,6 --> 0:22:41,933
ulcerated colitis, Lord,
fibromyalgia, all sorts of


405
0:22:41,933 --> 0:22:45,467
things that are triggered by the
tension inside, the anxiety


406
0:22:45,467 --> 0:22:49,867
inside, the fear inside, Lord,
that your natural healing virtue


407
0:22:49,867 --> 0:22:53,233
would flow through their bodies,
and they be released and healed


408
0:22:53,233 --> 0:22:55,567
of these diseases and maladies.


409
0:22:55,567 --> 0:22:56,933
In Jesus' name I ask.


410
0:22:56,933 --> 0:22:57,833
Amen.


411
0:22:57,833 --> 0:22:59,267
Sid: Amen.


412
0:22:59,267 --> 0:23:1,533
Now I can tell this.


413
0:23:1,533 --> 0:23:4,933
There is a requirement in the
Kingdom.


414
0:23:4,933 --> 0:23:9,4
It came from our teacher, our
Lord, the Messiah of Israel,


415
0:23:9,4 --> 0:23:12,233
Jesus, the Anointed One.


416
0:23:12,233 --> 0:23:17,667
And this is what he says: "I
will forgive you to the same


417
0:23:17,667 --> 0:23:21,2
degree, the same amount that you
forgive other people."


418
0:23:21,2 --> 0:23:24,333
So how much do you want God to
forgive you, 95 percent?


419
0:23:24,333 --> 0:23:25,833
You say, I don't feel like it.


420
0:23:25,833 --> 0:23:30,5
I don't deserve it.


421
0:23:30,5 --> 0:23:31,567
Doesn't count.


422
0:23:31,567 --> 0:23:34,0
Meaningless.


423
0:23:34,0 --> 0:23:41,233
God says, if you confess your
sins He is just and faithful to


424
0:23:41,233 --> 0:23:45,333
forgive you of all
unrighteousness and


425
0:23:45,333 --> 0:23:50,967
unforgiveness is a sin that
blocks the hand of God.


426
0:23:50,967 --> 0:23:58,5
Unforgiveness is taking the
arsenic you want your enemy to


427
0:23:58,5 --> 0:23:59,367
take.


428
0:23:59,367 --> 0:24:0,533
Stop it.


429
0:24:0,533 --> 0:24:1,767
Come to your senses.


430
0:24:1,767 --> 0:24:3,1
It's an act of your will.


431
0:24:3,1 --> 0:24:4,33
It's not a feeling.


432
0:24:4,33 --> 0:24:5,67
It's not emotion.


433
0:24:5,67 --> 0:24:6,5
So don't tell me you can't do
it.


434
0:24:6,5 --> 0:24:7,433
You can do it.


435
0:24:7,433 --> 0:24:9,67
You want to please the Living
God.


436
0:24:9,67 --> 0:24:12,0
There's no one else that you
need to please.


437
0:24:12,0 --> 0:24:13,433
Please Him.


438
0:24:13,433 --> 0:24:19,133
Tell Him you choose to forgive
that person out loud in Jesus'


439
0:24:19,133 --> 0:24:21,333
name and don't look back.


440
0:24:21,333 --> 0:24:23,833
And I'm going to tell you
something.


441
0:24:23,833 --> 0:24:26,667
Now does it mean you have to
trust them?


442
0:24:26,667 --> 0:24:28,2
Not until they earn it.


443
0:24:28,2 --> 0:24:30,233
But you can forgive them.


444
0:24:30,233 --> 0:24:33,0
I'm telling you, you can,
because I have.


445
0:24:33,0 --> 0:24:38,9
And then ask Jesus to forgive
you of everything you've ever


446
0:24:38,9 --> 0:24:43,567
done and say, "Jesus, I make you
my Lord.


447
0:24:43,567 --> 0:24:45,9
Come inside of me.


448
0:24:45,9 --> 0:24:48,67
Take over my life.


449
0:24:48,67 --> 0:24:50,433
I love you, Lord."


450
0:24:50,433 --> 0:24:55,5
And then I pray that you
experience the tangible presence


451
0:24:55,5 --> 0:28:7,267
of the love of the Living
God, in Jesus' name.


452
0:28:7,267 --> 0:28:10,367
Sid: Next week on
It's Supernatural!


453
0:28:10,367 --> 0:28:14,7
My guest was granted the
privilege to see the God of


454
0:28:14,7 --> 0:28:18,833
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob
speaking to the Messiah of


455
0:28:18,833 --> 0:28:22,4
Israel about the End Times.
