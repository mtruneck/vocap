1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,994
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.


2
0:0:0,994 --> 0:0:2,485
MALE SPEAKER: Lost his
balance on the--


3
0:0:2,485 --> 0:0:3,479
MALE SPEAKER: So hard to
get the fucking board


4
0:0:3,479 --> 0:0:4,97
to do what I want.


5
0:0:4,97 --> 0:0:7,24
LIZARD KING: Passion.


6
0:0:7,24 --> 0:0:8,87
MALE SPEAKER: So when did he
first start talking about


7
0:0:8,87 --> 0:0:10,46
wanting to do mega jump?


8
0:0:10,46 --> 0:0:12,11
JAKE BROWN: I think he actually
just came up with it


9
0:0:12,11 --> 0:0:13,95
the day before he was going
to do it or something.


10
0:0:13,95 --> 0:0:17,24
Or maybe that night, like,
he was partying.


11
0:0:17,24 --> 0:0:20,5
And then he just randomly
went and did it.


12
0:0:20,5 --> 0:0:23,3
LIZARD KING: I'm just fucking
super wasted, talking shit,


13
0:0:23,3 --> 0:0:25,52
saying that I'd go there
and do it and fucking--


14
0:0:25,52 --> 0:0:26,7
MALE SPEAKER: What,
did you run into


15
0:0:26,7 --> 0:0:28,18
him at a bar or something?


16
0:0:28,18 --> 0:0:31,64
LIZARD KING: Yeah, I was down
in Hensley's bar down south.


17
0:0:31,64 --> 0:0:33,44
One night, I was just talking
shit to all those fools.


18
0:0:33,44 --> 0:0:36,48
And the next thing I know, PLG
fucking pulls up at like 10:00


19
0:0:36,48 --> 0:0:37,84
in the morning and drove
me to Bob's house.


20
0:0:37,84 --> 0:0:41,765
It's just, like, still high as
fuck on ecstasy, just sitting


21
0:0:41,765 --> 0:0:43,86
there, like, what the fuck?


22
0:0:43,86 --> 0:0:46,42
I think I maybe slept for
30 minutes or something.


23
0:0:46,42 --> 0:0:47,52
MALE SPEAKER: So they just
thought you were


24
0:0:47,52 --> 0:0:48,655
claiming it, so?


25
0:0:48,655 --> 0:0:50,79
LIZARD KING: Yeah, I pretty
much got fucking put in my


26
0:0:50,79 --> 0:0:53,9
place, like, all right,
here it is.


27
0:0:53,9 --> 0:0:56,9
Fucking, let's put your mouth
where your fucking shit is.


28
0:0:56,9 --> 0:0:59,48
PIERRE LUC GAGNON: I set him up
with a board and some pads.


29
0:0:59,48 --> 0:1:1,92
At first he was claiming he
was going to do it without


30
0:1:1,92 --> 0:1:5,2
pads, but we were kind of like,
dude, you've been up all


31
0:1:5,2 --> 0:1:6,29
night, take it easy.


32
0:1:6,29 --> 0:1:9,44
Maybe you should just warm up
with kneepads, at least, and


33
0:1:9,44 --> 0:1:12,93
then when you get comfortable,
take your pads off.


34
0:1:12,93 --> 0:1:14,7
LIZARD KING: Dude, when I got
there, Bob's like, it's


35
0:1:14,7 --> 0:1:15,47
nothing, dude, try it.


36
0:1:15,47 --> 0:1:16,2
Check it out.


37
0:1:16,2 --> 0:1:19,2
He goes up, no pads, nothing,
just grabs his board, drops


38
0:1:19,2 --> 0:1:21,73
in, jumps the gap, and just
lands on his butt, looking at


39
0:1:21,73 --> 0:1:23,74
me, talking at me.


40
0:1:23,74 --> 0:1:24,49
He's like dude, it's easy.


41
0:1:24,49 --> 0:1:26,87
You got it, like sliding
on his ass.


42
0:1:26,87 --> 0:1:28,974
MALE SPEAKER: Any quotes, Bob?


43
0:1:28,974 --> 0:1:30,18
BOB: He's making it right now.


44
0:1:30,18 --> 0:1:30,655
No big deal.


45
0:1:30,655 --> 0:1:31,2
It's Lizard King.


46
0:1:31,2 --> 0:1:32,114
MALE SPEAKER: Do
it first shot.


47
0:1:32,114 --> 0:1:33,485
You fucking got it.


48
0:1:33,485 --> 0:1:35,77
BOB: All right.


49
0:1:35,77 --> 0:1:37,27
LIZARD KING: Slash drove
me up to the top.


50
0:1:37,27 --> 0:1:39,67
And we got up there and looking
down, I was fucking


51
0:1:39,67 --> 0:1:41,37
shitting myself.


52
0:1:41,37 --> 0:1:42,78
PIERRE LUC GAGNON: And it was
pretty crazy, because he was


53
0:1:42,78 --> 0:1:44,265
super hung over.


54
0:1:44,265 --> 0:1:47,2
And before he even tried,
he threw up.


55
0:1:47,2 --> 0:1:50,32
He was puking, because he was
kind of like nervous and hung


56
0:1:50,32 --> 0:1:52,95
over at the same time.


57
0:1:52,95 --> 0:1:56,47
LIZARD KING: Fucking
scared shitless.


58
0:1:56,47 --> 0:1:58,16
MALE SPEAKER: How far was
the gap that you made?


59
0:1:58,16 --> 0:2:0,555
LIZARD KING: I think
it's like 50 feet,


60
0:2:0,555 --> 0:2:2,51
or 55 feet, or something.


61
0:2:2,51 --> 0:2:4,46
Dude, yeah, it's nuts.


62
0:2:4,46 --> 0:2:7,15
And the way it's built, too,
it's like a step-up.


63
0:2:7,15 --> 0:2:8,419
You know what I mean?


64
0:2:8,419 --> 0:2:10,41
So the whole time you're rolling
up to it, it looks


65
0:2:10,41 --> 0:2:12,14
like you're going to just
fucking run into a green


66
0:2:12,14 --> 0:2:13,11
plywood wall.


67
0:2:13,11 --> 0:2:16,24
Like, if you hit that, you
just fall into a net.


68
0:2:16,24 --> 0:2:19,9
And the net is sketchy
as fuck.


69
0:2:19,9 --> 0:2:22,27
PIERRE LUC GAGNON: I mean, for
me, jumping down 15 stairs is


70
0:2:22,27 --> 0:2:24,95
way gnarlier than jumping
the mega ramp.


71
0:2:24,95 --> 0:2:27,82
So I was like, yeah, if he can
do shit like that, he can


72
0:2:27,82 --> 0:2:29,28
definitely do the mega ramp.


73
0:2:29,28 --> 0:2:32,5
I've seen guys do back flips
over the mega ramp, just like


74
0:2:32,5 --> 0:2:35,1
looping out because they'd
be in the backseat.


75
0:2:35,1 --> 0:2:38,63
This guy John Schultes, used to
be a pro skater, he got so


76
0:2:38,63 --> 0:2:40,76
scared he was like
leaning back.


77
0:2:40,76 --> 0:2:44,64
And he did a perfect back
flip into a knee slide.


78
0:2:44,64 --> 0:2:47,81
It's like the most insane
footage you've ever seen.


79
0:2:47,81 --> 0:2:50,69
So yeah, I was telling Lizard
all those stories.


80
0:2:50,69 --> 0:2:52,96
And he was pretty
hyped on them.


81
0:2:52,96 --> 0:2:56,93
Then tried it maybe, like, 5 to
10 more tries, and pulled


82
0:2:56,93 --> 0:2:58,18
it, like full pull.


83
0:2:58,18 --> 0:3:2,14



84
0:3:2,14 --> 0:3:6,53
[CHEERING]


85
0:3:6,53 --> 0:3:8,98
MALE SPEAKER: That was a make.


86
0:3:8,98 --> 0:3:11,19
PIERRE LUC GAGNON: Dude, that
was the fastest, probably


87
0:3:11,19 --> 0:3:13,22
fastest make I've ever seen.


88
0:3:13,22 --> 0:3:16,524
[CHEERING]


89
0:3:16,524 --> 0:3:18,44
PIERRE LUC GAGNON: Congrats.


90
0:3:18,44 --> 0:3:20,48
LIZARD KING: Wow, that
shit is so tight.


91
0:3:20,48 --> 0:3:22,24
PIERRE LUC GAGNON: After I took
him out to the mega ramp,


92
0:3:22,24 --> 0:3:24,46
we were drinking
this one night.


93
0:3:24,46 --> 0:3:28,38
And he was, like, dude, I'm
fucking getting "PLG" tattooed


94
0:3:28,38 --> 0:3:29,43
on my wrist.


95
0:3:29,43 --> 0:3:31,9
And I'm like, yeah right,
you're just drunk.


96
0:3:31,9 --> 0:3:33,31
I was like, yeah,
whatever Lizard.


97
0:3:33,31 --> 0:3:36,63
Then the text came in that
said, I told you, son.


98
0:3:36,63 --> 0:3:39,29
And it was like the ghettoist
tattoo of just like


99
0:3:39,29 --> 0:3:41,62
"PLG" on his wrist.


100
0:3:41,62 --> 0:3:44,47
Thrasher did the little
feature on it.


101
0:3:44,47 --> 0:3:48,0
The article kind of ended, it
was like, oh yeah, it'd be mad


102
0:3:48,0 --> 0:3:50,52
passion if PL would get
a Lizard tattoo.


103
0:3:50,52 --> 0:3:54,57
LIZARD KING: PLG got a big ass
lizard right here holding a


104
0:3:54,57 --> 0:3:56,607
flag that says "passion"
on it.


105
0:3:56,607 --> 0:3:59,41
[LAUGH].


106
0:3:59,41 --> 0:4:1,12
PIERRE LUC GAGNON: It's like
one of his board graphics,


107
0:4:1,12 --> 0:4:2,982
actually, so.


108
0:4:2,982 --> 0:4:4,88
MALE SPEAKER: [LAUGH].


109
0:4:4,88 --> 0:4:7,2
MALE SPEAKER: And then
you have a Laced one?


110
0:4:7,2 --> 0:4:8,39
LIZARD KING: Yeah,
because I was


111
0:4:8,39 --> 0:4:9,39
partying with Jake Browning.


112
0:4:9,39 --> 0:4:11,37
It was like, we stayed
at his house.


113
0:4:11,37 --> 0:4:12,43
I just got all fucked up.


114
0:4:12,43 --> 0:4:14,97
Did a bunch of coke, and a bunch
of ecstasy, and shit,


115
0:4:14,97 --> 0:4:17,28
and had some dude come over
and give me that one.


116
0:4:17,28 --> 0:4:19,29
[LAUGH].


117
0:4:19,29 --> 0:4:20,89
MALE SPEAKER: Wait, what's
Laced, is that your company?


118
0:4:20,89 --> 0:4:22,75
JAKE BROWN: Yeah.


119
0:4:22,75 --> 0:4:23,86
MALE SPEAKER: What is it?


120
0:4:23,86 --> 0:4:25,16
JAKE BROWN: It's a clothing
thing me, Smolik,


121
0:4:25,16 --> 0:4:26,75
and Sheffey are doing.


122
0:4:26,75 --> 0:4:29,2
We'd been drinking all night
or whatever and then he's


123
0:4:29,2 --> 0:4:31,1
like, I'm down, I'm going to
go get a Laced tattoo.


124
0:4:31,1 --> 0:4:33,31
We're like, yeah, right, all
right, see you tomorrow.


125
0:4:33,31 --> 0:4:35,746
He shows up the next day, he's
like, check it out, fool.


126
0:4:35,746 --> 0:4:35,978
[LAUGH].


127
0:4:35,978 --> 0:4:38,94
Like, dude, this fool's
beat us to the market


128
0:4:38,94 --> 0:4:40,55
shit on our own shit.


129
0:4:40,55 --> 0:4:40,885
[LAUGH].


130
0:4:40,885 --> 0:4:42,297
He's a fireball, man,
just hanging out


131
0:4:42,297 --> 0:4:44,61
with the dude, he's--


132
0:4:44,61 --> 0:4:45,77
you never know what's going
to happen next.


133
0:4:45,77 --> 0:4:49,84
He's like, 100%.


134
0:4:49,84 --> 0:4:51,18
PIERRE LUC GAGNON: There was
a contest when I was at the


135
0:4:51,18 --> 0:4:52,5
Harmony Festival.


136
0:4:52,5 --> 0:4:55,1
And it's this big hippy fest.


137
0:4:55,1 --> 0:4:58,5
Just like people taking
shrooms, and


138
0:4:58,5 --> 0:4:59,69
doing acid, and shit.


139
0:4:59,69 --> 0:5:1,84
And Lizard was going
to judge a contest.


140
0:5:1,84 --> 0:5:4,76
And next thing you know,
Lizard's nowhere to be found,


141
0:5:4,76 --> 0:5:6,59
just tripping all weekend.


142
0:5:6,59 --> 0:5:10,1
He ended up trying to judge a
contest, but all I remember


143
0:5:10,1 --> 0:5:13,4
hearing was Neil Hendrix telling
me that Lizard fell


144
0:5:13,4 --> 0:5:15,44
asleep halfway through
the contest.


145
0:5:15,44 --> 0:5:19,3
He was judging, and then halfway
through, he was like,


146
0:5:19,3 --> 0:5:21,84
that was fucking gnarly,
and just fell asleep.


147
0:5:21,84 --> 0:7:21,84
