WADE DAVIS: The first thing you
have to do when you even


7
0:2:56,11 --> 0:2:59,2
begin to try to understand a
phenomenon like the Haitian


8
0:2:59,2 --> 0:3:2,17
zombie, which is just one
thread woven through the


9
0:3:2,17 --> 0:3:5,44
fabric of this amazing culture,
is to sort of


10
0:3:5,44 --> 0:3:7,43
eliminate from your
consciousness all your


11
0:3:7,43 --> 0:3:9,33
preconceptions.


12
0:3:9,33 --> 0:3:12,61
HAMILTON MORRIS: In 1982,
Harvard ethnobotanist Wade


13
0:3:12,61 --> 0:3:15,28
Davis traveled to Port-au-Prince
to investigate


14
0:3:15,28 --> 0:3:18,93
the biological underpinnings
of the Haitian zombie.


15
0:3:18,93 --> 0:3:22,8
As early as 1938, Zora Neale
Hurston found there was a


16
0:3:22,8 --> 0:3:26,1
vodou potion that could induce a
death-like state, though she


17
0:3:26,1 --> 0:3:29,16
concluded the ingredients were
so guarded, no sorcerer would


18
0:3:29,16 --> 0:3:31,83
ever reveal them.


19
0:3:31,83 --> 0:3:34,36
Wade Davis did what Hurston
thought impossible.


20
0:3:34,36 --> 0:3:37,18
And over the course of four
years he gained the trust of


21
0:3:37,18 --> 0:3:40,27
several vodou sorcerers,
uncovering the ingredients of


22
0:3:40,27 --> 0:3:43,225
the secret potion, and
documenting his experience in


23
0:3:43,225 --> 0:3:48,97
the 1985 bestseller "The Serpent
and the Rainbow."


24
0:3:48,97 --> 0:3:51,5
Though Davis is quick to say
he's not a "zombieologist,"


25
0:3:51,5 --> 0:3:55,9
he's still considered the
world's leading authority on


26
0:3:55,9 --> 0:3:57,5
the Haitian Zombie.


27
0:3:57,5 --> 0:3:59,47
WADE DAVIS: Now what
is a zombie?


28
0:3:59,47 --> 0:4:2,28
A zombie, by folk belief,
is the living dead.


29
0:4:2,28 --> 0:4:5,61
It's an individual who has been
brought to his demise by


30
0:4:5,61 --> 0:4:9,45
sorcery, passed through the
grave, or at least passed


31
0:4:9,45 --> 0:4:14,72
through a state of death, and
then somehow magically


32
0:4:14,72 --> 0:4:16,54
resuscitated.


33
0:4:16,54 --> 0:4:21,89
Zombies were almost deemed to
be off-limits for serious


34
0:4:21,89 --> 0:4:23,3
academic research.


35
0:4:23,3 --> 0:4:27,22
But Lamarque Douyon had found
this really extraordinary case


36
0:4:27,22 --> 0:4:30,16
of this man called Clairvius
Narcisse.


37
0:4:30,16 --> 0:4:34,7
What made the case unique is
that Narcisse had been


38
0:4:34,7 --> 0:4:36,82
pronounced dead in the
Schweitzer Hospital.


39
0:4:36,82 --> 0:4:39,7
And his death had been witnessed
by two physicians,


40
0:4:39,7 --> 0:4:42,82
both American trained,
one an American.


41
0:4:42,82 --> 0:4:46,76
There were impeccable records
describing his pathology at


42
0:4:46,76 --> 0:4:48,24
the time of his demise.


43
0:4:48,24 --> 0:4:52,6
18 years later, this man
claiming to be Clairvius


44
0:4:52,6 --> 0:4:56,18
Narcisse turns up in his home
village, claiming that he'd


45
0:4:56,18 --> 0:4:58,51
been made a zombie.


46
0:4:58,51 --> 0:5:2,24
All these lines of evidence
led Lamarque Douyon to go


47
0:5:2,24 --> 0:5:7,85
public in about 1980, '81,
saying that they had found the


48
0:5:7,85 --> 0:5:11,12
first medically-verifiable
instance of a zombie.


49
0:5:11,12 --> 0:5:16,2
That kind of opening brought
everybody back to a series of


50
0:5:16,2 --> 0:5:20,15
reports that had existed in
the folk literature of the


51
0:5:20,15 --> 0:5:23,9
reputed existence of a folk
poison that was said to bring


52
0:5:23,9 --> 0:5:26,815
on a state of apparent death so
profound that it could fool


53
0:5:26,815 --> 0:5:27,89
a physician.


54
0:5:27,89 --> 0:5:30,65
Lamarque Douyon had tried for
some time to secure the


55
0:5:30,65 --> 0:5:34,58
formula of that preparation,
to no avail.


56
0:5:34,58 --> 0:5:37,71
And that's why I was brought
into the investigation.


57
0:5:37,71 --> 0:5:42,53
Schultes, my professor, the
man who sparked the


58
0:5:42,53 --> 0:5:45,2
Psychedelic Movement, he was
very much my mentor.


59
0:5:45,2 --> 0:5:48,48
I was working in the Amazon, and
one day he summoned me to


60
0:5:48,48 --> 0:5:51,89
his fourth-floor aerie at the
botanical museum and asked me


61
0:5:51,89 --> 0:5:55,84
if I wanted to go down to
Haiti for two weeks over


62
0:5:55,84 --> 0:5:58,37
spring break and try to find the
formula of the drug used


63
0:5:58,37 --> 0:5:59,26
to make zombies.


64
0:5:59,26 --> 0:6:1,31
Well naturally, I said, sure.


65
0:6:1,31 --> 0:6:3,53
There are lots of plants and
lots of animals that are


66
0:6:3,53 --> 0:6:5,42
poisonous and that
can kill you.


67
0:6:5,42 --> 0:6:7,92
We weren't just looking for
a toxin that could kill.


68
0:6:7,92 --> 0:6:10,28
We were looking for a toxin that
could bring on a state of


69
0:6:10,28 --> 0:6:12,68
apparent death so profound that
it would bring someone


70
0:6:12,68 --> 0:6:15,7
literally to the edge of death,
a threshold from which


71
0:6:15,7 --> 0:6:17,23
they could then recover.


72
0:6:17,23 --> 0:6:20,45
And I went down to Haiti and was
able to secure the formula


73
0:6:20,45 --> 0:6:22,22
of the preparation.


74
0:6:22,22 --> 0:6:23,96
HAMILTON MORRIS: The preparation
contains a


75
0:6:23,96 --> 0:6:28,57
veritable Whitman's Sampler of
poisons, showcasing the great


76
0:6:28,57 --> 0:6:32,47
diversity of Haiti's medicinal
flora and fauna, spanning two


77
0:6:32,47 --> 0:6:35,84
kingdoms and eight
Linnaean classes.


78
0:6:35,84 --> 0:6:39,3
The potions Davis collected
included such ingredients as


79
0:6:39,3 --> 0:6:45,64
datura stramonium, velvet bean,
cane toad, pufferfish


80
0:6:45,64 --> 0:6:51,1
Hispaniolan boa, bearded
fireworm, tarantula, cashew


81
0:6:51,1 --> 0:6:55,95
leaves, and the bones
of a human child.


82
0:6:55,95 --> 0:6:59,45
To the sorcerer who mixes the
potions, each ingredient


83
0:6:59,45 --> 0:7:2,85
serves a distinct purpose, with
the human bones playing a


84
0:7:2,85 --> 0:7:7,27
role every bit as important as
the psychoactive plants.


85
0:7:7,27 --> 0:7:11,1
But to Davis, two ingredients
held the key to understanding


86
0:7:11,1 --> 0:7:14,23
the phenomenon of
zombification.


87
0:7:14,23 --> 0:7:16,21
The pufferfish contains
a chemical called


88
0:7:16,21 --> 0:7:19,12
tetrodotoxin, or TTX.


89
0:7:19,12 --> 0:7:21,8
If administered in the correct
dose, the victim will find


90
0:7:21,8 --> 0:7:25,6
themselves trapped in a flaccid
paralysis, perfectly


91
0:7:25,6 --> 0:7:27,83
mimicking the appearance
of death.


92
0:7:27,83 --> 0:7:31,5
Upon their exhumation, the
victim is fed a paste of


93
0:7:31,5 --> 0:7:33,91
datura stramonium, which
obliterates their memory,


94
0:7:33,91 --> 0:7:38,6
leaving them in a stupefied,
obedient delirium.


95
0:7:38,6 --> 0:7:42,53
WADE DAVIS: We never could prove
really anything, but we


96
0:7:42,53 --> 0:7:45,78
could show that this was
something that had a kind of


97
0:7:45,78 --> 0:7:50,24
coherence within the worldview
of the Haitian people.


98
0:7:50,24 --> 0:7:53,95
If it could not be absolutely
proven, it was at least so


99
0:7:53,95 --> 0:7:57,71
provocative that it demanded
investigation.


100
0:7:57,71 --> 0:7:59,97
If you eliminate the other
possibilities, you have to


101
0:7:59,97 --> 0:8:2,3
allow the facts to speak
for themselves.


102
0:8:2,3 --> 0:8:5,9
And that's why I was prepared
to say very strongly that I


103
0:8:5,9 --> 0:8:7,41
thought this phenomenon
existed.


104
0:8:7,41 --> 0:8:11,44



105
0:8:11,44 --> 0:8:13,51
HAMILTON MORRIS: In the years
since the publication of


106
0:8:13,51 --> 0:8:17,1
Davis's work, there's been
little formal investigation of


107
0:8:17,1 --> 0:8:18,76
the zombie phenomenon.


108
0:8:18,76 --> 0:8:21,78
Though teams of scientists and
anthropologists have traveled


109
0:8:21,78 --> 0:8:25,54
to Haiti in search of answers,
they often failed to find what


110
0:8:25,54 --> 0:8:26,93
they're looking for.


111
0:8:26,93 --> 0:8:30,15
Some have been fooled in
elaborate hoaxes, or found


112
0:8:30,15 --> 0:8:32,45
that the zombies could be
explained medically, with


113
0:8:32,45 --> 0:8:34,75
conditions such as
schizophrenia.


114
0:8:34,75 --> 0:8:37,49
And others have been imprisoned
or sent home with


115
0:8:37,49 --> 0:8:38,74
nothing at all.


116
0:8:38,74 --> 0:8:42,96
In Haiti, the use of this powder
is a crime on par with


117
0:8:42,96 --> 0:8:46,61
murder, and those who concoct
it do so with the knowledge


118
0:8:46,61 --> 0:8:51,28
that it will be used to
destroy a human life.


119
0:8:51,28 --> 0:8:54,57
In light of all this
uncertainty, I will travel to


120
0:8:54,57 --> 0:8:57,85
Haiti to investigate the zombie
and attempt to collect


121
0:8:57,85 --> 0:9:0,83
poison samples for the first
chemical analysis


122
0:9:0,83 --> 0:9:3,67
in almost 30 years.


123
0:9:3,67 --> 0:9:7,9
My results could support Davis's
theory or redefine our


124
0:9:7,9 --> 0:9:10,75
concept of the Haitian zombie.


125
0:9:10,75 --> 0:9:12,68
Or I could have a
railroad spike


126
0:9:12,68 --> 0:9:13,95
driven through my scrotum.


127
0:9:13,95 --> 0:11:13,95
