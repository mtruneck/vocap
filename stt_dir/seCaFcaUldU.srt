0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:20,856



2
0:0:20,856 --> 0:0:22,39
LUCY: Hi, I'm Lucy.


3
0:0:22,39 --> 0:0:24,16
This is Misty Meadow
Farm in Kent.


4
0:0:24,16 --> 0:0:25,41
Let me show you our ponies.


5
0:0:25,41 --> 0:0:29,7



6
0:0:29,7 --> 0:0:31,54
This is Olivia.


7
0:0:31,54 --> 0:0:32,89
She's nine years old.


8
0:0:32,89 --> 0:0:34,77
She's my best friend really.


9
0:0:34,77 --> 0:0:36,0
She's really sweet.


10
0:0:36,0 --> 0:0:38,19
But she's very quiet.


11
0:0:38,19 --> 0:0:39,96
Olivia's favorite food
is probably things


12
0:0:39,96 --> 0:0:42,5
like carrots, apples.


13
0:0:42,5 --> 0:0:44,73
But she is actually on
a restricted diet.


14
0:0:44,73 --> 0:0:47,146
She has a mask that she
wears when she goes


15
0:0:47,146 --> 0:0:48,12
out during the day.


16
0:0:48,12 --> 0:0:49,37
Because she'll just pig.


17
0:0:49,37 --> 0:0:54,62



18
0:0:54,62 --> 0:0:57,67
INTERVIEWER: Why do you
like Shetland ponies?


19
0:0:57,67 --> 0:0:58,96
LUCY: Their size.


20
0:0:58,96 --> 0:1:1,86
They're very cute, and they're
very friendly.


21
0:1:1,86 --> 0:1:4,4
Ah, she's with the dog.


22
0:1:4,4 --> 0:1:12,52



23
0:1:12,52 --> 0:1:15,4
Shetlands tend to be a very
piggy breed of pony.


24
0:1:15,4 --> 0:1:17,99
And we do things like jumping
with her to help her basically


25
0:1:17,99 --> 0:1:19,24
keep the weight off.


26
0:1:19,24 --> 0:1:25,209



27
0:1:25,209 --> 0:1:26,459
Good girl.


28
0:1:26,459 --> 0:1:29,9



29
0:1:29,9 --> 0:1:31,11
This is Olivia's passport.


30
0:1:31,11 --> 0:1:34,54
All ponies basically have to
have a passport which will


31
0:1:34,54 --> 0:1:37,34
record any injections that
they've ever had.


32
0:1:37,34 --> 0:1:40,43
And also it will show their
family tree, so that when you


33
0:1:40,43 --> 0:1:42,49
buy them you know where they've
come from, what their


34
0:1:42,49 --> 0:1:43,78
background is.


35
0:1:43,78 --> 0:1:46,97
Olivia's father is called
Toy House Mousie


36
0:1:46,97 --> 0:1:49,93
Prince John of Lancaster.


37
0:1:49,93 --> 0:1:52,97
And her mother is called
Copperfield's Betty Boop.


38
0:1:52,97 --> 0:2:2,16



39
0:2:2,16 --> 0:2:5,65
She's friends with a lot
of ponies in her field.


40
0:2:5,65 --> 0:2:7,48
She probably has a special mate
that she hangs out with.


41
0:2:7,48 --> 0:2:9,5
They tend to, like, have
a best friend each.


42
0:2:9,5 --> 0:2:15,62



43
0:2:15,62 --> 0:2:18,8
This here is Julianne.


44
0:2:18,8 --> 0:2:21,57
She's pretty much, I would say,
one of the naughtiest


45
0:2:21,57 --> 0:2:22,88
ones that we've got here.


46
0:2:22,88 --> 0:2:23,84
And she's actually
wearing a muzzle.


47
0:2:23,84 --> 0:2:27,85
Because she's got a lot of
weight on her at the moment.


48
0:2:27,85 --> 0:2:31,49
And the best way to keep it
off is to have this muzzle


49
0:2:31,49 --> 0:2:31,9
thing on her.


50
0:2:31,9 --> 0:2:33,43
But it's actually the first
day she's worn it.


51
0:2:33,43 --> 0:2:35,82
And she hates it.


52
0:2:35,82 --> 0:2:38,42
We've had a bit of an issue with
the fencing over there


53
0:2:38,42 --> 0:2:39,93
which we've sort of
had to put up a


54
0:2:39,93 --> 0:2:41,99
makeshift sort of barricade.


55
0:2:41,99 --> 0:2:45,71
Well basically we turned up one
day and found that Olivia


56
0:2:45,71 --> 0:2:48,55
and Julianne had got in there.


57
0:2:48,55 --> 0:2:50,8
And they were scrumping away
on all the apples.


58
0:2:50,8 --> 0:2:52,37
Some Shetland ponies
actually don't care


59
0:2:52,37 --> 0:2:53,28
about electric fencing.


60
0:2:53,28 --> 0:2:55,42
And they are happy to take the
shock, basically, just to get


61
0:2:55,42 --> 0:2:57,4
to the grass that's on the
other side of the fence.


62
0:2:57,4 --> 0:3:2,15



63
0:3:2,15 --> 0:3:5,325
So the darker colored
pony that's closest


64
0:3:5,325 --> 0:3:6,87
to us at the moment--


65
0:3:6,87 --> 0:3:7,85
she's called Tia.


66
0:3:7,85 --> 0:3:10,28
And her little foal
is called Morgan.


67
0:3:10,28 --> 0:3:10,84
He's a boy.


68
0:3:10,84 --> 0:3:12,16
He's only a week old.


69
0:3:12,16 --> 0:3:15,24
And then the other one over
there-- she's called Holly.


70
0:3:15,24 --> 0:3:17,17
That's her daughter, who
was also born last


71
0:3:17,17 --> 0:3:18,42
week, called Hannah.


72
0:3:18,42 --> 0:3:28,72



73
0:3:28,72 --> 0:3:30,56
Yeah, they're so fluffy
at this age--


74
0:3:30,56 --> 0:3:35,73



75
0:3:35,73 --> 0:3:36,98
fluffy and tiny.


76
0:3:36,98 --> 0:3:46,28



77
0:3:46,28 --> 0:3:47,5
INTERVIEWER: Would you
say that you're quite


78
0:3:47,5 --> 0:3:48,15
good friends now?


79
0:3:48,15 --> 0:3:49,83
LUCY: Yeah, yeah, she is.


80
0:3:49,83 --> 0:3:50,922
She's my little girl.


81
0:3:50,922 --> 0:3:52,36
She's my little pony.


82
0:3:52,36 --> 0:3:53,61
I love her.


83
0:3:53,61 --> 0:5:53,61
