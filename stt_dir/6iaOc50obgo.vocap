###15 Sophie, could you come in here, please ?
###21 Yes, Damien ?
###24 I've been thinking.
###26 We've become rather staid recently.
###28 We haven't really produced
###29 any truly interesting titles for some time.
###33 We need some new... blood.
###39 Did you have anyone in mind ?
###41 I was rather hoping you might.
###43 How about Peter Gibbons ?
###46 I don't think so.
###50 Jason Murray ?
###51 Too... arty.
###55 - Tim Bisley. - Bisley ?
###58 Why do I know that name ?
###60 'He came in last year.
###62 'You laughed him out of the office.
###64 'He had blond hair.
###66 'Small ears.'
###67 Yes, Bisley. That's right.
###71 I remember his work now.
###73 All muscles and guns. Most amusing.
###76 Give him a ring, will you Sophie ?
###78 - Get me his portfolio. - Ok.
###83 I think it's time we gave young Mr Bisley another shot.
###103 # Oh, baby
###107 # Oh, baby
###111 # Oh, baby #
###117 You idiot.
###122 - Morning. Coffee and Kilroy ? - No thanks.
###125 - Tea and Tricia ? - No !
###127 Why are you scrimmaging around ?
###128 - Sophie from Darkstar called. - Sophie.
###132 Damien Knox wants to see my portfolio.
###134 Sophie.
###135 No, Damien Knox. The head of Darkstar Comix.
###138 He wants to see my portfolio. I am a little nervous.
###141 God, wow. He wants to see your portfolio ?
###144 God, what a break. That's brilliant.
###146 - Is it, Daisy ? - Yeah.
###148 God, well done.
###149 That's excellent. Really good. Well done, you.
###152 Well done.
###157 - What's that ? - I don't know.
###159 It's upstairs. Maybe it's Marsha.
###161 - Maybe it's Mike. - Maybe it's Mike AND Marsha.
###165 Ready to go again, soldier ?
###167 Cock-locked and ready to rock.
###172 Got anything planned ?
###173 I have got a bit of a project.
###175 I'm gonna be as inactive as I can
###177 in order to get into the psyche of someone unemployed,
###180 vocationally and cerebrally,
###182 to see if enforced passivity exacerbates itself.
###186 Does inactivity breed laziness ?
###188 - You writing an article on it ? - No. I can't be bothered.
###199 I'm not really a praying man and I never really ask you for much,
###202 so if you could see your way clear to helping me today,
###205 I would be really grateful.
###207 Thank you very much. Amen.
###221 "I'm a massive wanker."
###230 It's all right. It's my messenger.
###238 - That's weird. - What ?
###239 - There's nobody there. - Oi oi !
###242 You lucky people.
###244 Oh, hi, Tyres.
###247 I understand you two "friends" wanted to talk to me.
###250 I was wondering if you could run my portfolio over to Darkstar.
###254 I see. You don't call me for weeks
###255 and all of a sudden you want a favour.
###257 That's nice. The last time I seen you, you said
###260 you wished I was your da
###261 and hugged me for the entire length
###263 of Josh Wink's Higher State of Consciousness.
###266 And now you want me to ferry round your "art" ?
###269 - Yes, please. - Ok.
###271 By the way, you owe me 20 quid.
###273 Oh, right. Yeah.
###275 How are you, my pocket Shakespeare ?
###277 Come up with any exciting literary characters ?
###280 Yes, actually.
###281 Dizzy Steinway.
###283 I like it.
###285 What is she, some sort of crime-busting jazz singer ?
###288 No. It's the name I'm using to sign on.
###290 You want to get off your arse
###291 and get a job, Dizzy, or whatever your name isn't.
###294 - Nice hair, by the way. - There you go, mate.
###297 - Cheers. - My livelihood is in here.
###300 - Guard it with your life. - As ever. You out this weekend ?
###303 I'm a bit strapped for cash actually. Lend me 20 quid ?
###307 - Yeah, sure. - Great.
###310 What's that noise ?
###311 Um...
###313 - We don't know. - I like it.
###324 You better get off. That's got to be there by 11.
###327 Right, sir. I've got a good feeling about this parcel.
###330 Hopefully things might start going my way.
###332 You know what it's like. Door, please, Timmy.
###336 Right.
###340 That was close. He nearly went disco.
###343 What is that noise ?
###345 I don't know. I'm gonna find out.
###347 - Can you tell Mike I need him ? - What for ?
###350 No reason, I just... need him.
###354 'Can you feel it in your butt ? That's good.'
###358 Marsha ?
###359 Come in, kitten. It's open.
###361 '... two, turn, one... '
###363 - Morning, Daisy. - Hi, Mike.
###365 - Nice outfit. - Thanks.
###367 - Tim wants you. - Wants me or needs me ?
###369 Needs you.
###371 Right. Ladies.
###374 So what you up to, Marsha ?
###376 It's Cher's new fitness video. Thong for Europe.
###380 Mike reckons I got between 15 and 20 years
###383 to find hubby number three and I want to look my best.
###387 Why don't you come for a jog with me ?
###389 Oh, no. No.
###391 Come on. It'll be fun.
###393 Get off your ass. Get the adrenaline pumpin'.
###396 No, I shouldn't do sport of any kind.
###398 I'm actually allergic to endorphins. I get very competitive.
###402 Anyway, who wants to look like these people ?
###405 Go to the gym all day, go to some premiere in a low-cut dress
###409 to get on the cover of some magazine.
###411 What kind of a life is that ?
###413 I'm happy right where I am.
###416 - Where is it ? - Where's what ?
###419 There was a picture of a man with a white eye
###421 saying "I am a massive wanker."
###423 And if you put it in my portfolio I cannot begin
###425 to describe the damage you may have done.
###427 Well, I...
###429 We want this to be easy. You're amongst friends.
###432 - I just... - What ?
###433 - What you done with it ? - Did you put it in my portfolio ?
###436 I put it in A portfolio.
###438 What ? !
###440 I put it in your portfolio.
###442 What ? !
###443 Did she say what I think ?
###444 - She put it in my portfolio. - What ? !
###447 I thought you'd forgotten it. I was trying to help.
###449 That was a picture of a man who is about to decide
###452 whether I work for Darkstar Comix.
###454 You see why I left it out ?
###456 Yes ! Yes, yes. And I'm sorry. I was just trying to help.
###459 Don't ! If you're going to help, get off your ass and help yourself.
###462 Why is everyone talking about my ass ?
###464 Mike. We've got to try and stop Tyres.
###468 Don't worry, Daisy.
###469 Tim's just really angry at you
###471 because you've jeopardised his future, Ok ?
###475 I was just trying to help.
###478 God.
###480 Ow, ow, ow.
###482 - All right, Kitten ? - Yes !
###484 Sure you don't want to come for a jog ?
###486 - Yes. - You got work to do ?
###488 No.
###490 What you gonna do, then ?
###492 Sit around the house waiting for Tim to come home ?
###495 I'll get my plimsolls.
###505 Is Brian there ?
###509 Why are you dressed like that ?
###511 Thought you might like to come for a run.
###513 Might ease your frustration.
###516 What frustration ?
###518 Why ? I like going out ! I want to stay in.
###522 And have sex ? That's all you ever want.
###525 I'm not here for one thing. I want you to see me as a whole.
###528 - I do. - Whole with a "w".
###531 Just thought you might like a jog.
###535 No, can't. Mum's coming, we're going out for lunch.
###538 Is that why you're dressed like that ?
###540 She thinks I'm a lawyer.
###543 Bloody 'ell.
###544 I thought I knew all your little secrets.
###548 No wonder you're so tense.
###551 Come on !
###554 Come on !
###555 What is the hold-up ?
###557 There's been an accident.
###559 Somebody got hurt.
###561 - Who ? - A lady.
###566 - How d'you know ? - Because we hit her.
###569 - Did we ? - Yeah. That's her there.
###571 - Ah ! - What the hell are you doing ?
###574 It's broad daylight !
###575 You have no consideration for cyclists.
###579 Pardon ?
###581 What the hell are you doing ? It's broad daylight.
###583 You have no consideration for cyclists.
###585 All right. What's your problem ?
###592 - You all right ? - Yeah.
###593 - Think you can go on ? Come on. - Yeah.
###610 Yeah. Yeah, sure.
###613 Sure.
###615 That's not gonna happen
###617 cos he's a small fish in a big pond
###619 and I'm a big... shark !
###621 Yes, yes. OK. Bye.
###624 Hi, Mum.
###626 - Hello, love. - Shall we go ?
###627 Aren't we going in ?
###629 No, I've got the builders in. They're making a wall.
###632 I know a good place to eat.
###636 This is all right.
###638 - What did I tell you ? - It's quite fun.
###655 Shit, there he is.
###656 Tyres !
###676 What about you ?
###678 - Don't deliver that parcel. - Why ?
###680 There's something I don't want them to see.
###683 Paperclips ?
###684 No. Where's my portfolio ?
###686 I delivered that half an hour ago.
###688 Noooooooooooooooo !
###692 Did you get it ?
###693 - Nice outfit. - Thanks.
###697 Tim Bisley's portfolio has arrived.
###700 Right.
###702 Actually, I'll look at it after lunch.
###715 Couldn't we go get it ?
###717 Not even I can get to the upper reaches.
###719 Parcels are left at reception and collected by personnel.
###722 - Damn. - They must let some people up.
###725 - Not without an appointment. - Shit.
###727 How am I gonna get my picture back ? Mike, any ideas ?
###739 Tyres ?
###741 Yeah, but we'll need another walkie-talkie.
###744 - Or two.
###749 Can I have a large half-caff frappuccino, please ?
###753 With whipped cream and marshmallow dunkers... Mum ?
###757 Yes. I'll have one of those, too.
###761 When in Rome.
###763 - So how is everything ? - Good.
###767 - How's Twist ? - Good. 0ut of town.
###770 Can't wait to meet her.
###771 Very busy.
###773 Well, fashion is big business these days, Brian.
###775 You know that.
###783 Oh, are they friends of yours ?
###785 Never seen them before.
###793 - Brian, what is it ? - Sorry ?
###797 - What is it ? - It's me again.
###799 - I can see that. - Third time today.
###802 Have you got something to deliver ?
###804 I was thinking, I'm getting a bit
###806 long in the tooth with this cycling lark.
###808 The old pins ain't what they used to be.
###810 What's your point ?
###812 I was wondering what it's like to be a security guard.
###815 I really look up to people like you.
###818 Do you ?
###819 Yeah. How'd I get to be like you ?
###821 Well, tell you what, give us your name and address,
###825 and I'll send you all you need to apply.
###827 - Would you ? - Sure. Why not ?
###830 Brilliant. All right. My name's Henry Krinkle.
###833 K-r-i-n-k-l-e.
###835 154, Hopper Avenue.
###837 - Hopper ? - Yeah, Hopper.
###843 Ow. Ow.
###849 Colin ! Stop her.
###852 Who does he think he is ? Bob bloody Kane ?
###855 Tell him I'd make more money pimping his grandmother.
###861 How's Dad ?
###862 Oh, you know him. Frustrated as ever. He's taken up art classes.
###866 - What ? - Yes.
###868 I think he'd always fancied himself as an artist.
###871 He keeps it to himself.
###873 We always hoped you might go in for that sort of thing.
###876 You were so good at it at school.
###877 It might have given you something to talk about with your father.
###881 - Mum. - What, love ?
###887 Something I should tell you.
###889 What is it ?
###891 This is it. Fourth floor.
###894 - You ready ? - I was born ready.
###896 - But are you ready now ? - Yeah.
###898 We've only got to get the picture back and not get caught.
###901 How hard can that be ?
###904 Tell Stan I'll speak to him later.
###906 After I've put Bisley out of his misery.
###918 There it is.
###920 - Shit. - Is it locked ?
###922 No, I was joking.
###924 - What are we gonna do ? - Er... there.
###928 - What ? - Ventilation shaft.
###930 Simple and classic.
###933 Oh.
###936 - I can't believe this. - I'm sorry.
###938 - Why ? - I thought you'd be disappointed.
###942 That's so silly. We don't mind what you do,
###945 so long as you're not gay.
###946 I bet you made up Twist, as well.
###948 I should've known. What sort of a name is Twist ?
###951 - No, she's real. - Well, that's something.
###955 - So, you're an artist. - Yep.
###958 What sort of thing do you do ?
###960 Um, anger.
###962 Aaaaaaaah !
###967 Pain.
###968 Ow !
###969 Fear.
###974 Aggression.
###978 Watercolours ?
###981 Do you go clubbing much ?
###982 No, do a lot of night work.
###984 I love night work. I'm usually up all hours.
###987 - Speeding through the night ? - Something like that.
###998 Ok, stay out of sight.
###999 If anybody comes, warn me on the walkie.
###1001 - Roger. - Let's go.
###1024 - How's your knee ? - I'll live.
###1028 My teeth hurt.
###1030 I wish I hadn't started this now.
###1033 I'm sorry, Marsha, but I did warn you.
###1038 It was the same with netball.
###1041 At school.
###1044 'I remember playing a friendly in the upper sixth.
###1047 'I played goal attack.
###1050 'And I had a wee rivalry with the goalie on the other team.
###1053 'She was called Nina.
###1055 'I remember the goal shooter took a shot
###1058 'and it was obvious Nina was gonna save.
###1060 'So I did what I had to do.
###1063 'I saved the game.
###1066 'But I lost a lot of friends.'
###1070 I just shouldn't exercise.
###1073 It's not just bad for me, it's bad for everybody.
###1076 I don't know. I'm really feeling the benefit now.
###1084 Come on, let's fuck off home.
###1086 Hmm. I wonder if Tim's back.
###1090 What's Colin looking at ?
###1097 Where's he off to ?
###1101 Oh, my God !
###1103 So, when did you decide to become an artist ?
###1107 I think it was, you know, when the dog died.
###1109 Oh, you never did get over that.
###1112 Colin !
###1113 Colin !
###1129 Pom-Pom !
###1134 Not again.
###1135 Colin !
###1143 Daisy !
###1154 What the hell do you think you're doing ?
###1157 Ooh, um. Well.
###1159 - I... was just... - Looking for this ?
###1164 Yes. Yeah, um...
###1167 I had to get it back, you see.
###1169 I mean if Mr Knox saw it, then...
###1173 It wouldn't really do you any favours ?
###1175 No, no, no.
###1177 No, um.
###1180 How are you, Sophie ?
###1181 Fine, thanks.
###1182 Good, good.
###1185 I forgot you worked here.
###1187 Really ?
###1190 'Tim, that girl you fancy's coming into the office.'
###1196 Thanks, Mike.
###1200 How's Damien ?
###1202 I'm sorry. You just ran out in front of me.
###1205 I know you. You're a massive wanker.
###1209 I said I was sorry.
###1211 I've had enough of keeping fit. It's too bloody dangerous.
###1214 If people throw themselves in front of cars, what do you expect ?
###1218 She could sue you.
###1220 For what ?
###1222 Dangerous driving.
###1223 Bloody hell, you're not a lawyer ?
###1225 No, he's an artist.
###1230 - Here's your picture. - Thanks.
###1234 I think I'll keep this one.
###1236 Yeah, fine.
###1239 It was nice to see you again, Tim.
###1241 You're nice, too. It was nice to see you, too.
###1246 - Tim. - Yes.
###1248 - What are you doing on Friday ? - What ?
###1250 Would you like to go out for a drink with me on Friday ?
###1254 Yeah.
###1257 Great. I'll give you a ring.
###1259 OK.
###1261 - See you Friday. - See you Friday.
###1272 You get it ?
###1274 That's not all I got.
###1276 Leave the coffee !
###1280 No, never been to Ibiza.
###1282 You should go, mate.
###1283 Went to Gran Canaria. I got some pictures, actually.
###1289 - What the... - The cat is out of the bag.
###1293 'Repeat, the cat is out of the bag.'
###1295 Shit.
###1301 He's taking the stairs, get the lift.
###1304 'He's taking the stairs, get the lift ! '
###1307 Shit.
###1337 Bisley.
###1338 Hi.
###1340 Well now. You're keen, aren't you ?
###1344 Haven't had a chance to look over your stuff yet.
###1349 Oh, that's all right.
###1353 - Everything all right, Willis ? - Sorry, sir.
###1355 Thought I saw unauthorised personnel on the monitor.
###1358 I haven't seen anybody.
###1362 I'll get back to me desk, then.
###1364 - Hello, Mike. - Hello.
###1365 - What are you doing here ? - I'm with Tim.
###1367 Right. You coming to TA Saturday ?
###1369 Oh, yes. Stealth and tactics weekend. I wouldn't miss it.
###1373 I've an idea for an infiltration technique.
###1376 It involves draining a man's blood, replacing it with Tizer.
###1379 Sounds great. Look forward to that.
###1381 - See you Saturday. - Yeah.
###1383 Sir.
###1384 Yes, right.
###1387 Good to see you looking so enthusiastic, Bisley.
###1390 I'll let you know either way.
###1393 Thanks, Mr Knox.
###1395 - Damien. - Thanks, Damien.
###1402 - Nice outfit. - Oh, thanks.
###1405 He's nice, isn't he ?
###1409 So, we happy ?
###1410 Are we happy.
###1411 Right, mine's a pint of the black stuff.
###1414 You can't drink a pint of Bovril.
###1419 What do you think ?
###1420 Very good. Very good indeed.
###1424 Schedule him in for a meeting next Tuesday.
###1427 I think we're going to be seeing a lot of young Mr Bisley.
###1437 - Oi oi. - Oh. Hello.
###1440 Hi. Listen, I got that picture back.
###1442 - That's not all he got. - Mike.
###1444 - I got off me ass. - Did you ?
###1446 - Yeah. - What happened ?
###1447 I bumped into a friend of yours.
###1449 Really ? Why don't you tell me all about it ?
###1451 - My ass ? - Yeah, if you like.
###1455 Where's Tyres ?
