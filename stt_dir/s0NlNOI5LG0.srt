1
0:1:16,452 --> 0:1:18,746
Thank you very much, sir.


2
0:1:18,746 --> 0:1:20,998
You did a wonderful job. Wonderful.


3
0:1:20,998 --> 0:1:23,459
Shh. Shh.


4
0:1:23,459 --> 0:1:26,962
We did it, Pete. We did it.


5
0:1:26,962 --> 0:1:28,756
- For a moment, we had our doubts.
- Shh.


6
0:1:28,756 --> 0:1:32,259
To continue, you've listened
to a long and complex case...


7
0:1:32,259 --> 0:1:34,136
murder in the first degree.


8
0:1:34,136 --> 0:1:39,183
A premeditated murder is the most serious
charge tried in our criminal courts.


9
0:1:39,183 --> 0:1:41,18
You've listened to the testimony.


10
0:1:41,18 --> 0:1:44,21
You've had the law read to you
and interpreted as it applies in this case.


11
0:1:44,21 --> 0:1:48,942
It's now your duty to sit down and try
and separate the facts from the fancy.


12
0:1:48,942 --> 0:1:53,28
One man is dead.
Another man's life is at stake.


13
0:1:53,28 --> 0:1:57,367
If there's a reasonable doubt in your minds
as to the guilt of the accused...


14
0:1:57,367 --> 0:1:59,369
a reasonable doubt...


15
0:1:59,369 --> 0:2:2,247
then you must bring me
a verdict of not guilty.


16
0:2:2,247 --> 0:2:4,208
Now if, however,
there's no reasonable doubt...


17
0:2:4,208 --> 0:2:9,213
then you must in good conscience
find the accused guilty.


18
0:2:9,213 --> 0:2:13,425
However you decide,
your verdict must be unanimous.


19
0:2:13,425 --> 0:2:16,887
In the event
that you find the accused guilty...


20
0:2:16,887 --> 0:2:20,307
the bench will not entertain
a recommendation for mercy.


21
0:2:20,307 --> 0:2:23,602
The death sentence
is mandatory in this case.


22
0:2:23,602 --> 0:2:29,316
You're faced with a grave responsibility.
Thank you, gentlemen.


23
0:2:29,316 --> 0:2:37,366
The alternate jurors are excused.


24
0:2:37,366 --> 0:4:37,361
The jury will now retire.


25
0:4:37,361 --> 0:4:40,697
Try this one. See if I can get it...


26
0:4:40,697 --> 0:4:45,702
It's a muggy day.


27
0:4:45,702 --> 0:5:0,133
Hey. Oh, oh.


28
0:5:0,133 --> 0:5:2,302
- Piece of gum?
- No, thanks.


29
0:5:2,302 --> 0:5:4,471
This thing is...


30
0:5:4,471 --> 0:5:7,724
- Huh?
- ...move it.


31
0:5:7,724 --> 0:5:9,977
- Come on, I'll give you a hand.
- Give me a hand with that.


32
0:5:9,977 --> 0:5:16,942
That's it.


33
0:5:16,942 --> 0:5:18,652
- You know something?
- Yeah?


34
0:5:18,652 --> 0:5:20,487
I called the weather bureau this morning.


35
0:5:20,487 --> 0:5:22,489
This is gonna be
the hottest day of the year.


36
0:5:22,489 --> 0:5:24,157
Could be.


37
0:5:24,157 --> 0:5:26,159
Boy, you'd think they'd at least
air-condition these places.


38
0:5:26,159 --> 0:5:29,579
- What is your name, sir?
- Oh, it's, uh - That one, yeah.


39
0:5:29,579 --> 0:5:31,81
Thank you very much.


40
0:5:31,81 --> 0:5:33,917
Okay, gentlemen, everybody's here.


41
0:5:33,917 --> 0:5:36,837
Now, if there's anything you want,
I'll be right outside the door.


42
0:5:36,837 --> 0:5:51,601
- Just knock.
- Okay, thanks. We will.


43
0:5:51,601 --> 0:5:52,894
Good morning.


44
0:5:52,894 --> 0:5:54,438
I never knew they locked the door.


45
0:5:54,438 --> 0:5:57,691
Sure they lock the door.
What'd you think?


46
0:5:57,691 --> 0:6:1,737
I don't know.
It just never occurred to me.


47
0:6:1,737 --> 0:6:3,613
What's that for?


48
0:6:3,613 --> 0:6:5,574
Oh, I thought we might want
to vote by ballot.


49
0:6:5,574 --> 0:6:10,495
Great idea. Maybe we can
get him elected senator.


50
0:6:10,495 --> 0:6:15,751
Just in case, you know.


51
0:6:15,751 --> 0:6:17,961
- Î—ow'd you like it?
- Oh, I don't know.


52
0:6:17,961 --> 0:6:19,713
It was pretty interesting.


53
0:6:19,713 --> 0:6:21,757
Yeah? I almost fell asleep.


54
0:6:21,757 --> 0:6:24,426
I mean, I've never been
on a jury before.


55
0:6:24,426 --> 0:6:28,305
No? I've sat on many juries.


56
0:6:28,305 --> 0:6:31,308
What gets me is the way
those lawyers talk and talk and talk...


57
0:6:31,308 --> 0:6:33,56
even when it's an open-and-shut case
like this one.


58
0:6:33,56 --> 0:6:35,353
Did you ever hear
so much talk about nothin'?


59
0:6:35,353 --> 0:6:37,314
Well, I guess they're entitled.


60
0:6:37,314 --> 0:6:40,984
Yeah. They're entitled.
It's the system, but...


61
0:6:40,984 --> 0:6:45,155
If you ask me, I'd slap those tough kids
down before they start any trouble.


62
0:6:45,155 --> 0:6:47,324
It would save us a lot of time and money.


63
0:6:47,324 --> 0:6:48,95
- Hey, let's get started, huh?
- That's a good idea.


64
0:6:48,95 --> 0:6:51,661
- Yeah, let's get goin', huh?
- We probably all got things to do here.


65
0:6:51,661 --> 0:6:54,79
I figured we'd start out with a five-minute break.
There's one gentleman in the bathroom.


66
0:6:54,79 --> 0:6:55,832
- Mr. Foreman.
- Huh?


67
0:6:55,832 --> 0:6:58,71
- Are, uh - Are we gonna sit in order?
- Gee, I don't know.


68
0:6:58,71 --> 0:7:5,467
I, uh - Well, I guess so.


69
0:7:5,467 --> 0:7:7,1
Uh, you're in my seat.


70
0:7:7,1 --> 0:7:11,556
- Oh. Excuse me.
- That's all right.


71
0:7:11,556 --> 0:7:16,937
Hey, that's not a bad view, huh?


72
0:7:16,937 --> 0:7:19,481
What did you think of the case?


73
0:7:19,481 --> 0:7:21,608
I mean, it had a lot of interest for me.


74
0:7:21,608 --> 0:7:25,612
No real... dead spots.
You know what I mean?


75
0:7:25,612 --> 0:7:28,156
I tell you, we were lucky
to get a murder case.


76
0:7:28,156 --> 0:7:30,2
I figured us for an assault or burglary.


77
0:7:30,2 --> 0:7:34,37
Boy, they can be the dullest.


78
0:7:34,37 --> 0:7:35,413
Hey.


79
0:7:35,413 --> 0:7:37,82
That the Woolworth Building?


80
0:7:37,82 --> 0:7:39,84
That's right.


81
0:7:39,84 --> 0:7:40,752
Isn't that funny?


82
0:7:40,752 --> 0:7:43,213
You know, I've lived here all my life.
I've never been inside that.


83
0:7:43,213 --> 0:7:45,382
If you had to sort out all that junk...


84
0:7:45,382 --> 0:7:47,551
Like that thing with the movies.


85
0:7:47,551 --> 0:7:50,637
- Yeah. You can say that again.
- And what about that business with the knife?


86
0:7:50,637 --> 0:7:53,598
I mean, asking grown-up people
to believe that kind of jazz, huh?


87
0:7:53,598 --> 0:7:56,143
Well, I expected that.
You know what we're dealing with.


88
0:7:56,143 --> 0:7:58,687
Yeah, I guess so.


89
0:7:58,687 --> 0:8:2,65
Well, your horn works.
Now try your lights.


90
0:8:2,65 --> 0:8:3,608
- What do you got, a cold?
- And how.


91
0:8:3,608 --> 0:8:5,902
These hot-weather colds can kill you.


92
0:8:5,902 --> 0:8:8,405
I can hardly touch my nose.
You know what I mean?


93
0:8:8,405 --> 0:8:12,33
I sure do. I just got over one.


94
0:8:12,33 --> 0:8:14,87
Aw, come on. Mr.
Foreman, let's go here, huh?


95
0:8:14,87 --> 0:8:16,58
Well, that guy's still in the bathroom.


96
0:8:16,58 --> 0:8:19,499
Hey, what's new? I didn't get a chance
to see a paper this morning.


97
0:8:19,499 --> 0:8:20,667
Hmm?


98
0:8:20,667 --> 0:8:23,17
I was only wondering
how the market closed.


99
0:8:23,17 --> 0:8:25,964
You got a seat on the Exchange?


100
0:8:25,964 --> 0:8:27,799
I'm a broker.


101
0:8:27,799 --> 0:8:32,262
I run a messenger service -
the Beck and Call Company.


102
0:8:32,262 --> 0:8:34,472
The name is my wife's idea.


103
0:8:34,472 --> 0:8:38,185
Got 37 men working.
Started with nothing.


104
0:8:38,185 --> 0:8:44,524
Okay, men, let's take our seats, huh?


105
0:8:44,524 --> 0:8:46,443
Yeah, we can all get outta here
pretty quick, huh?


106
0:8:46,443 --> 0:8:49,738
I don't know about the rest of you, but I happen
to have tickets to that ball game tonight.


107
0:8:49,738 --> 0:8:51,656
Yanks and Cleveland.


108
0:8:51,656 --> 0:8:53,533
Yeah, we got this kid,
Modjelewski, in there.


109
0:8:53,533 --> 0:8:55,285
Ooh, he's a real bull, this kid.


110
0:8:55,285 --> 0:8:57,495
You know - Phoom!


111
0:8:57,495 --> 0:8:59,831
A real jug handle. You know?


112
0:8:59,831 --> 0:9:2,167
Phoom!


113
0:9:2,167 --> 0:9:4,586
You're a real baseball fan, aren't you?
Huh? Yeah.


114
0:9:4,586 --> 0:9:6,129
Where do we sit here?


115
0:9:6,129 --> 0:9:9,299
Well, I thought we'd sit in order,
you know, by jury numbers.


116
0:9:9,299 --> 0:9:11,801
One, two, three, four, five -
so on, around the table.


117
0:9:11,801 --> 0:9:13,136
If that's okay with you gentlemen.


118
0:9:13,136 --> 0:9:14,304
- Sure.
- What's the difference?


119
0:9:14,304 --> 0:9:17,432
- I think it's reasonable to sit in order.
- Let it be.


120
0:9:17,432 --> 0:9:19,768
- Number 12. Do I sit down here?
- Yeah. That's 12. We go around...


121
0:9:19,768 --> 0:9:23,104
- We start with you. One, right?
- One, yeah. Two, three, four, five, six.


122
0:9:23,104 --> 0:9:25,523
What was your impression
of the prosecuting attorney?


123
0:9:25,523 --> 0:9:27,317
Okay. Two. You're two.


124
0:9:27,317 --> 0:9:28,568
I beg pardon?


125
0:9:28,568 --> 0:9:32,822
I thought he was really sharp, the way
he handled all those points one by one.


126
0:9:32,822 --> 0:9:36,34
Logical sequence.
I was very impressed.


127
0:9:36,34 --> 0:9:39,12
I think he - he did an expert job.


128
0:9:39,12 --> 0:9:42,207
A lot of drive too, you know?
Real drive.


129
0:9:42,207 --> 0:9:44,376
- Okay, fellas, can we hold it down a minute?
- Sure.


130
0:9:44,376 --> 0:9:46,44
Uh, fellas.


131
0:9:46,44 --> 0:9:51,174
Say, we'd like to get started.
Gentleman at the window.


132
0:9:51,174 --> 0:9:53,426
- We'd like to get started.
- Oh, I'm sorry.


133
0:9:53,426 --> 0:9:57,18
Pretty tough to figure, isn't it?
Kid kills his father - bing, just like that.


134
0:9:57,18 --> 0:9:59,849
Aw, listen, you analyze the figures,
you'll see it happens all the time.


135
0:9:59,849 --> 0:10:1,851
They let those kids
run wild up there.


136
0:10:1,851 --> 0:10:4,646
Well, maybe it serves 'em right.
You know what I mean?


137
0:10:4,646 --> 0:10:6,314
Is - Is everyone here?


138
0:10:6,314 --> 0:10:8,233
The old man is inside.


139
0:10:8,233 --> 0:10:10,944
Oh. Would you, uh,
knock on the door for him?


140
0:10:10,944 --> 0:10:12,988
You a Yankee fan?


141
0:10:12,988 --> 0:10:15,448
No. Baltimore.


142
0:10:15,448 --> 0:10:18,243
- Baltimore?
- Yeah.


143
0:10:18,243 --> 0:10:22,539
That's like being hit in the head
with a crowbar once a day.


144
0:10:22,539 --> 0:10:23,873
Who have they got?


145
0:10:23,873 --> 0:10:26,376
No, I mean, who have they got
besides good groundskeepers?


146
0:10:26,376 --> 0:10:28,3
Say, uh, we'd like to get started.


147
0:10:28,3 --> 0:10:31,84
Oh, forgive me, gentlemen.
I - I didn't mean to keep you waiting.


148
0:10:31,84 --> 0:10:33,717
Baltimore?


149
0:10:33,717 --> 0:10:36,594
Okay, gentlemen,
if I can have your attention.


150
0:10:36,594 --> 0:10:39,639
You fellas can handle this thing
any way that you want to.


151
0:10:39,639 --> 0:10:42,225
I'm, um - You know,
I'm not gonna make any rules.


152
0:10:42,225 --> 0:10:45,603
Uh, we can, well, discuss it first
and, uh, then vote on it.


153
0:10:45,603 --> 0:10:48,356
That's, of course, uh -
That's, uh, one way.


154
0:10:48,356 --> 0:10:51,401
And, uh, well, we can
vote on it right now, and...


155
0:10:51,401 --> 0:10:53,987
I think it's customary
to take a preliminary vote.


156
0:10:53,987 --> 0:10:57,657
Yeah, let's - Let's vote. Who knows?
Maybe we all can get outta here, huh?


157
0:10:57,657 --> 0:10:59,451
Uh-huh.


158
0:10:59,451 --> 0:11:2,62
Okay, then I think that, uh...


159
0:11:2,62 --> 0:11:5,582
Of course you know that we have
a first-degree murder charge here...


160
0:11:5,582 --> 0:11:7,751
and if we vote the accused guilty...


161
0:11:7,751 --> 0:11:11,87
uh, we've got to send him
to the chair.


162
0:11:11,87 --> 0:11:14,924
- Um, that's mandatory.
- I think we know that.


163
0:11:14,924 --> 0:11:16,76
- Let's see who's where.
- We might as well.


164
0:11:16,76 --> 0:11:21,765
- Okay. Uh, anyone doesn't want to vote?
- All right with me.


165
0:11:21,765 --> 0:11:26,436
Okay. Then, uh, just remember that this
has to be 12 to nothing either way.


166
0:11:26,436 --> 0:11:27,979
Um, that's the law.


167
0:11:27,979 --> 0:11:30,106
Okay, are we ready?


168
0:11:30,106 --> 0:11:37,113
Now, all those voting guilty,
please raise your hands.


169
0:11:37,113 --> 0:11:41,951
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...


170
0:11:41,951 --> 0:11:44,621
eight, nine, 10, 11.


171
0:11:44,621 --> 0:11:47,624
Okay. That's 11 guilty.


172
0:11:47,624 --> 0:11:50,293
Those voting not guilty.


173
0:11:50,293 --> 0:11:52,462
One. Right.


174
0:11:52,462 --> 0:11:55,673
That's 11 guilty. One not guilty.


175
0:11:55,673 --> 0:11:57,342
Well, now we know where we are.


176
0:11:57,342 --> 0:12:2,55
Boy, oh, boy. There's always one.


177
0:12:2,55 --> 0:12:4,432
So, what do we do now?


178
0:12:4,432 --> 0:12:6,351
Well, I guess we talk.


179
0:12:6,351 --> 0:12:7,769
Boy, oh, boy.


180
0:12:7,769 --> 0:12:13,66
You really think he's innocent?


181
0:12:13,66 --> 0:12:14,692
I don't know.


182
0:12:14,692 --> 0:12:17,654
I mean, you sat in court with the rest of us.
You heard what we did.


183
0:12:17,654 --> 0:12:19,864
The kid's a dangerous killer.
You could see it.


184
0:12:19,864 --> 0:12:21,574
He's 18 years old.


185
0:12:21,574 --> 0:12:23,743
Well, that's old enough. Î—e...


186
0:12:23,743 --> 0:12:26,496
He stabbed his own father
four inches into the chest.


187
0:12:26,496 --> 0:12:28,832
They proved it
a dozen different ways in court.


188
0:12:28,832 --> 0:12:31,459
Would you like me to list them for you?


189
0:12:31,459 --> 0:12:32,836
No.


190
0:12:32,836 --> 0:12:35,4
Then what do you want?


191
0:12:35,4 --> 0:12:38,7
- I just want to talk.
- What's there to talk about?


192
0:12:38,7 --> 0:12:39,426
Eleven men in here think he's guilty.


193
0:12:39,426 --> 0:12:41,761
No one had to think about it twice
except you.


194
0:12:41,761 --> 0:12:45,56
I want to ask you something.
Do you believe his story?


195
0:12:45,56 --> 0:12:47,851
I don't know whether I believe it or not.
Maybe I don't.


196
0:12:47,851 --> 0:12:49,519
So how come you vote not guilty?


197
0:12:49,519 --> 0:12:51,521
Well, there were 11 votes for guilty.


198
0:12:51,521 --> 0:12:54,357
It's not easy to raise my hand
and send a boy off to die...


199
0:12:54,357 --> 0:12:56,526
without talking about it first.


200
0:12:56,526 --> 0:13:0,238
- Well, now, who says it's easy?
- No one.


201
0:13:0,238 --> 0:13:2,49
What, just because I voted fast?


202
0:13:2,49 --> 0:13:4,993
I honestly think the guy's guilty.


203
0:13:4,993 --> 0:13:7,871
You couldn't change my mind
if you talked for a hundred years.


204
0:13:7,871 --> 0:13:10,457
I'm not trying to change your mind.
It's just that...


205
0:13:10,457 --> 0:13:12,792
We're talking about somebody's life here.


206
0:13:12,792 --> 0:13:14,961
We can't decide it in five minutes.
Supposing we're wrong.


207
0:13:14,961 --> 0:13:16,463
"Supposing we're wrong."


208
0:13:16,463 --> 0:13:18,548
Supposing this whole building
should fall down on my head.


209
0:13:18,548 --> 0:13:21,384
- You can suppose anything.
- That's right.


210
0:13:21,384 --> 0:13:23,219
Look, what's the difference
how long it takes?


211
0:13:23,219 --> 0:13:25,889
Suppose we do it in five minutes.
So what?


212
0:13:25,889 --> 0:13:28,99
Let's take an hour.


213
0:13:28,99 --> 0:13:32,729
The ball game doesn't start till 8:00.


214
0:13:32,729 --> 0:13:36,65
Hmm?


215
0:13:36,65 --> 0:13:37,984
Who's got something to say?


216
0:13:37,984 --> 0:13:39,486
I'm willing to sit for an hour.


217
0:13:39,486 --> 0:13:42,28
Great. I heard
a pretty good story last night.


218
0:13:42,28 --> 0:13:45,74
That's not why we're sitting here.


219
0:13:45,74 --> 0:13:49,871
All right, then you tell me.
What are we sitting here for?


220
0:13:49,871 --> 0:13:52,707
I don't know. Maybe no reason.


221
0:13:52,707 --> 0:13:56,252
Look, this kid's been kicked around
all of his life...


222
0:13:56,252 --> 0:14:0,256
you know, born in a slum,
mother dead since he was nine.


223
0:14:0,256 --> 0:14:2,55
He lived for a year and a half
in an orphanage when his...


224
0:14:2,55 --> 0:14:5,553
his father was serving a jail term
for forgery.


225
0:14:5,553 --> 0:14:7,972
It's not a very happy beginning.


226
0:14:7,972 --> 0:14:10,183
He's a - a wild, angry kid.


227
0:14:10,183 --> 0:14:11,976
That's all he's ever been.
And you know why?


228
0:14:11,976 --> 0:14:15,772
'Cause he's been hit on the head
by somebody once a day every day.


229
0:14:15,772 --> 0:14:18,66
He's had a -
He's had a pretty miserable 18 years.


230
0:14:18,66 --> 0:14:21,11
I - I just think we owe him a few words.
That's all.


231
0:14:21,11 --> 0:14:24,739
I don't mind telling you this, mister.
We don't owe him a thing.


232
0:14:24,739 --> 0:14:27,909
He got a fair trial, didn't he?
What do you think that trial cost?


233
0:14:27,909 --> 0:14:31,79
- He's lucky he got it. You know what I mean?
- You know it.


234
0:14:31,79 --> 0:14:33,498
Now, look, we're all grown-ups in here.


235
0:14:33,498 --> 0:14:35,458
We heard the facts, didn't we?


236
0:14:35,458 --> 0:14:39,337
You're not gonna tell me that we're supposed
to believe this kid, knowing what he is.


237
0:14:39,337 --> 0:14:41,798
Listen, I've lived among them
all my life.


238
0:14:41,798 --> 0:14:45,218
You can't believe a word they say.
You know that.


239
0:14:45,218 --> 0:14:47,136
I mean, they're born liars.


240
0:14:47,136 --> 0:14:50,557
- Only an ignorant man can believe that.
- Now listen...


241
0:14:50,557 --> 0:14:53,476
Do you think you were born
with a monopoly on the truth?


242
0:14:53,476 --> 0:14:56,145
I think certain things should be
pointed out to this man.


243
0:14:56,145 --> 0:14:58,314
- Come on. This isn't Sunday.
- We don't need a sermon.


244
0:14:58,314 --> 0:15:1,609
- Come on.
- We have a job to do. Now let's do it.


245
0:15:1,609 --> 0:15:5,488
Rice Pops.
It's a product I work on at the agency.


246
0:15:5,488 --> 0:15:8,199
"The breakfast with the built-in bounce."


247
0:15:8,199 --> 0:15:9,909
- I wrote that line.
- Very catchy.


248
0:15:9,909 --> 0:15:12,161
- Yeah.
- Say, do you mind?


249
0:15:12,161 --> 0:15:13,955
Oh, I'm sorry.


250
0:15:13,955 --> 0:15:16,499
I have this habit of doodling.
Keeps me thinking clearly.


251
0:15:16,499 --> 0:15:18,293
Yeah, we have all this work to do.


252
0:15:18,293 --> 0:15:20,86
- There's no point staying here forever.
- Sorry.


253
0:15:20,86 --> 0:15:22,38
Okay. Um...


254
0:15:22,38 --> 0:15:26,259
perhaps if the gentleman down there
who's disagreeing with us...


255
0:15:26,259 --> 0:15:29,637
Well, perhaps you could tell us why.
You know, let us know what you're thinking.


256
0:15:29,637 --> 0:15:32,98
And we might be able to show you
where you're mixed up.


257
0:15:32,98 --> 0:15:33,85
Well, look, maybe -
Maybe this is an idea.


258
0:15:33,85 --> 0:15:36,352
Now, I haven't given it much thought,
but it seems to me...


259
0:15:36,352 --> 0:15:40,857
that it's up to the group of us to convince
this gentleman that he's wrong and we're right.


260
0:15:40,857 --> 0:15:44,819
Now, maybe if we each took
a couple of minutes just to...


261
0:15:44,819 --> 0:15:46,321
Well, it was just a quick idea.


262
0:15:46,321 --> 0:15:47,864
No, no, no. That's a good one.


263
0:15:47,864 --> 0:15:51,34
Uh, suppose we go
once around the table.


264
0:15:51,34 --> 0:15:53,995
- I guess you're first.
- Oh.


265
0:15:53,995 --> 0:15:56,873
Well, uh...


266
0:15:56,873 --> 0:16:0,335
Well, it-it's hard to put into words.


267
0:16:0,335 --> 0:16:2,42
I just think he's guilty.


268
0:16:2,42 --> 0:16:5,6
I thought it was obvious
from the word "go."


269
0:16:5,6 --> 0:16:6,591
I mean, nobody proved otherwise.


270
0:16:6,591 --> 0:16:8,217
Nobody has to prove otherwise.


271
0:16:8,217 --> 0:16:10,553
The burden of proof's on the prosecution.


272
0:16:10,553 --> 0:16:13,97
The defendant doesn't even
have to open his mouth.


273
0:16:13,97 --> 0:16:16,309
- That's in the Constitution.
- Oh, well, sure, I know that.


274
0:16:16,309 --> 0:16:20,63
Uh, what I meant was, is...


275
0:16:20,63 --> 0:16:22,148
Well, I just think he's guilty.


276
0:16:22,148 --> 0:16:23,941
I-I mean, somebody saw him do it.


277
0:16:23,941 --> 0:16:29,72
Okay. Uh, here's what I think,
and I have no personal feelings about this.


278
0:16:29,72 --> 0:16:32,241
I just want to talk about facts.


279
0:16:32,241 --> 0:16:34,911
Number one.


280
0:16:34,911 --> 0:16:39,123
The old man lived downstairs under the room
where the killing took place.


281
0:16:39,123 --> 0:16:41,334
At 10 minutes after 12:00
on the night of the killing...


282
0:16:41,334 --> 0:16:45,88
he heard loud noises,
said it sounded like a fight.


283
0:16:45,88 --> 0:16:48,49
And he heard the kid yell out,
"I'm gonna kill ya."


284
0:16:48,49 --> 0:16:50,426
A second later,
he heard a body hit the floor.


285
0:16:50,426 --> 0:16:52,22
Ran to the door, opened it up...


286
0:16:52,22 --> 0:16:54,722
saw the kid running down the stairs
and out of the house.


287
0:16:54,722 --> 0:16:56,99
Called the police.


288
0:16:56,99 --> 0:16:58,851
They came in, found the old man
with a knife in his chest.


289
0:16:58,851 --> 0:17:2,188
The coroner fixed the time of death
around midnight.


290
0:17:2,188 --> 0:17:5,358
Now these are facts.
You can't refute facts.


291
0:17:5,358 --> 0:17:7,61
The kid is guilty.


292
0:17:7,61 --> 0:17:9,696
I'm just as sentimental as the next fella.


293
0:17:9,696 --> 0:17:13,658
I know he's only 18, but he's still
gotta pay for what he did.


294
0:17:13,658 --> 0:17:15,201
I'm with you.


295
0:17:15,201 --> 0:17:17,829
Okay. Are you finished?


296
0:17:17,829 --> 0:17:19,372
- Yeah.
- Right. Next.


297
0:17:19,372 --> 0:17:22,667
It is obvious, to me anyway,
that the boy's entire story was flimsy.


298
0:17:22,667 --> 0:17:24,961
He claimed he was at the movies
during the time of the killing...


299
0:17:24,961 --> 0:17:27,588
and yet, one hour later, he couldn't
remember the names of the films he saw...


300
0:17:27,588 --> 0:17:29,507
- or who played in them.
- That's right.


301
0:17:29,507 --> 0:17:31,884
And no one saw him going in
or out of the theater.


302
0:17:31,884 --> 0:17:33,594
Listen, what about the woman
across the street?


303
0:17:33,594 --> 0:17:35,972
If her testimony don't prove it,
nothing does.


304
0:17:35,972 --> 0:17:38,391
That's right. She was the one
who actually saw the killing.


305
0:17:38,391 --> 0:17:40,893
- Now, fellas, please.
- Let's go in order here, huh?


306
0:17:40,893 --> 0:17:44,23
Just a minute. Here's a woman...


307
0:17:44,23 --> 0:17:46,774
Here's a woman who was lying in bed.
She can't sleep.


308
0:17:46,774 --> 0:17:48,776
She's dying with the heat.
You know what I mean?


309
0:17:48,776 --> 0:17:50,695
Anyway, she looks out the window...


310
0:17:50,695 --> 0:17:54,365
and right across the street she sees
the kid stick the knife into his father.


311
0:17:54,365 --> 0:17:57,326
The time is 12:10 on the nose.


312
0:17:57,326 --> 0:17:59,287
Everything fits.


313
0:17:59,287 --> 0:18:1,205
Look, she's known the kid all his life.


314
0:18:1,205 --> 0:18:3,416
His window is right opposite hers
across the el tracks...


315
0:18:3,416 --> 0:18:5,168
and she swore she saw him do it.


316
0:18:5,168 --> 0:18:7,92
- Through the windows of the passing el train.
- Right.


317
0:18:7,92 --> 0:18:12,175
This el train had no passengers on it.
It was just being moved downtown.


318
0:18:12,175 --> 0:18:15,178
The lights were out, remember?
And they proved in court that, at night...


319
0:18:15,178 --> 0:18:17,68
you can look through the windows
of an el train when the lights are out...


320
0:18:17,68 --> 0:18:20,99
and see what's happening
on the other side.


321
0:18:20,99 --> 0:18:23,19
- They proved it.
- I'd like to ask you something.


322
0:18:23,19 --> 0:18:25,772
You don't believe the boy's story.
How come you believe the woman's?


323
0:18:25,772 --> 0:18:30,193
She's one of them too, isn't she?


324
0:18:30,193 --> 0:18:32,278
You're a pretty smart fella, aren't you?


325
0:18:32,278 --> 0:18:33,78
- Okay, gentlemen.
- Now, now.


326
0:18:33,78 --> 0:18:36,73
- Now, gentlemen.
- Come on. Sit down. Sit down.


327
0:18:36,73 --> 0:18:38,701
Oh, what's he so wise about?
I'm telling you.


328
0:18:38,701 --> 0:18:42,38
- Okay, now come on.
- Now we're not gonna get anywhere fighting.


329
0:18:42,38 --> 0:18:43,372
Whose turn is it next?


330
0:18:43,372 --> 0:18:48,461
Oh, uh, his. Number five.


331
0:18:48,461 --> 0:18:52,6
Okay, may I - Can I pass? It...


332
0:18:52,6 --> 0:18:54,133
Well, uh, that's your privilege.


333
0:18:54,133 --> 0:18:57,345
Uh, how about the next gentleman?


334
0:18:57,345 --> 0:19:0,97
Oh. Well, uh, I don't know.


335
0:19:0,97 --> 0:19:4,894
I started to be convinced, you know,
very early in the case.


336
0:19:4,894 --> 0:19:9,106
You see, I was looking for a motive.
That's very important.


337
0:19:9,106 --> 0:19:13,402
Because if you don't have a motive,
where's your case, right?


338
0:19:13,402 --> 0:19:16,572
Anyway, that, uh, testimony
from those people...


339
0:19:16,572 --> 0:19:19,7
in the apartment across the hall
from the kid's apartment...


340
0:19:19,7 --> 0:19:22,36
that was very powerful.


341
0:19:22,36 --> 0:19:24,914
Didn't they say something about a -
a fight and an argument...


342
0:19:24,914 --> 0:19:29,418
between the old man and his son
around about, uh, 7:00 that night?


343
0:19:29,418 --> 0:19:31,963
- I mean, I could be wrong, but I -
- It was 8:00.


344
0:19:31,963 --> 0:19:34,9
It was 8:00. That's right.
They heard an argument.


345
0:19:34,9 --> 0:19:35,925
They couldn't hear what it was about.


346
0:19:35,925 --> 0:19:37,969
Then they heard
the father hit the boy twice.


347
0:19:37,969 --> 0:19:41,13
Finally they saw the boy
run angrily out of the house.


348
0:19:41,13 --> 0:19:42,682
What does that prove?


349
0:19:42,682 --> 0:19:46,435
Well, it don't exactly prove anything.
It's just part of the picture.


350
0:19:46,435 --> 0:19:49,438
Well, you said it provided a motive.
The prosecuting attorney said the same thing.


351
0:19:49,438 --> 0:19:51,774
I don't think
that was a very strong motive.


352
0:19:51,774 --> 0:19:55,444
This boy's been hit so many times in his
life that violence is practically a...


353
0:19:55,444 --> 0:19:57,905
It's a normal state of affairs with him.


354
0:19:57,905 --> 0:20:2,201
I just - I can't see two slaps in the face
provoking him into committing murder.


355
0:20:2,201 --> 0:20:8,332
It may have been two too many.
Everyone has a breaking point.


356
0:20:8,332 --> 0:20:10,501
Anything else?


357
0:20:10,501 --> 0:20:13,45
- No.
- Okay.


358
0:20:13,45 --> 0:20:16,632
Uh, how about you?


359
0:20:16,632 --> 0:20:20,136
I don't know. It's all been said.


360
0:20:20,136 --> 0:20:23,973
You can talk here forever.
It's still the same thing.


361
0:20:23,973 --> 0:20:27,18
This kid is five for 0.


362
0:20:27,18 --> 0:20:28,978
Well, look at his record.


363
0:20:28,978 --> 0:20:31,272
When he was 10,
he was in children's court.


364
0:20:31,272 --> 0:20:33,149
He threw a rock at a teacher.


365
0:20:33,149 --> 0:20:35,526
When he was 15, he was in reform school.


366
0:20:35,526 --> 0:20:37,445
He stole a car.


367
0:20:37,445 --> 0:20:40,31
He's been arrested for mugging.


368
0:20:40,31 --> 0:20:42,116
He was picked up twice for knife fighting.


369
0:20:42,116 --> 0:20:44,285
Oh, yeah, they say
he's real handy with a knife.


370
0:20:44,285 --> 0:20:47,163
Oh, this is a very fine boy.


371
0:20:47,163 --> 0:20:50,249
Ever since he was five years old,
his father beat him up regularly.


372
0:20:50,249 --> 0:20:52,752
- He used his fists.
- Well, so would I.


373
0:20:52,752 --> 0:20:54,337
A kid like that?


374
0:20:54,337 --> 0:21:0,9
It's these kids, the way they are nowadays.


375
0:21:0,9 --> 0:21:3,93
When I was a kid,
I used to call my father "sir."


376
0:21:3,93 --> 0:21:5,306
That's right. "Sir."


377
0:21:5,306 --> 0:21:7,35
Do you ever hear a kid
call his father that any more?


378
0:21:7,35 --> 0:21:10,645
Fathers don't seem to think
it's important any more.


379
0:21:10,645 --> 0:21:14,65
- You got any kids?
- Three.


380
0:21:14,65 --> 0:21:16,901
I got one.


381
0:21:16,901 --> 0:21:24,784
Twenty-two years old.


382
0:21:24,784 --> 0:21:29,246
When he was nine years old,
he ran away from a fight.


383
0:21:29,246 --> 0:21:34,85
I saw it. I was so embarrassed
I almost threw up.


384
0:21:34,85 --> 0:21:41,217
I said, "I'm gonna make a man out of you
if I have to break you in two trying."


385
0:21:41,217 --> 0:21:44,136
Well, I made a man out of him.


386
0:21:44,136 --> 0:21:47,89
When he was 16, we had a fight.


387
0:21:47,89 --> 0:21:53,688
Hit me in the jaw.
He was a big kid.


388
0:21:53,688 --> 0:21:57,692
Haven't seen him for two years.


389
0:21:57,692 --> 0:22:1,696
Kids.


390
0:22:1,696 --> 0:22:6,242
Work your heart out.


391
0:22:6,242 --> 0:22:7,576
Well, let's get going.


392
0:22:7,576 --> 0:22:9,996
I think we're missing the point here.


393
0:22:9,996 --> 0:22:13,499
This boy, let's say he's the product
of a broken home and a filthy neighborhood.


394
0:22:13,499 --> 0:22:17,169
We can't help that. We're here to decide
whether he's innocent or guilty...


395
0:22:17,169 --> 0:22:20,172
not to go into the reasons
why he grew up the way he did.


396
0:22:20,172 --> 0:22:22,967
He was born in a slum.
Slums are breeding grounds for criminals.


397
0:22:22,967 --> 0:22:24,927
I know it, and so do you.


398
0:22:24,927 --> 0:22:29,724
It's no secret children from slum backgrounds
are potential menaces to society.


399
0:22:29,724 --> 0:22:31,976
- Now I think -
- Brother, you can say that again.


400
0:22:31,976 --> 0:22:34,603
The kids who crawl out of these places
are real trash.


401
0:22:34,603 --> 0:22:36,939
- I don't want any part of them. I'm telling you.
- Listen, mister. Listen.


402
0:22:36,939 --> 0:22:40,735
- I, uh - I've lived in a slum all my life.
- Wait a minute.


403
0:22:40,735 --> 0:22:44,238
Please, I - I played in backyards
that were filled with garbage.


404
0:22:44,238 --> 0:22:46,365
I mean, maybe you can still
smell it on me.


405
0:22:46,365 --> 0:22:47,783
Now, listen, sonny.


406
0:22:47,783 --> 0:22:49,452
- Come on now.
- There's nothing personal about this.


407
0:22:49,452 --> 0:22:52,79
- No, there was something personal.
- Aw, come on, fella. He didn't mean you.


408
0:22:52,79 --> 0:22:54,248
Let's not be so sensitive.


409
0:22:54,248 --> 0:22:56,167
This sensitivity I can understand.


410
0:22:56,167 --> 0:23:1,964
Okay, look, let's stop the arguing.
We're only wasting time, and...


411
0:23:1,964 --> 0:23:5,426
Look, your turn down there.
Let's go.


412
0:23:5,426 --> 0:23:8,345
Oh, I didn't expect a turn. I thought
you were all gonna try to convince me.


413
0:23:8,345 --> 0:23:10,181
- Wasn't that the idea?
- Check. That was the idea.


414
0:23:10,181 --> 0:23:12,475
- Oh, I forgot about that. He's right.
- What difference does it make?


415
0:23:12,475 --> 0:23:14,894
He's the one who's keeping us in here.
Let's hear what he's got to say.


416
0:23:14,894 --> 0:23:17,688
Oh, now wait a minute.
We decided to do this a certain way.


417
0:23:17,688 --> 0:23:19,398
I think we ought to stick to that way.


418
0:23:19,398 --> 0:23:21,484
Oh, stop being a kid, will you?


419
0:23:21,484 --> 0:23:23,569
- What do you mean "a kid"?
- What do you think I mean?


420
0:23:23,569 --> 0:23:27,782
K-I-D. Kid.


421
0:23:27,782 --> 0:23:31,535
What? Listen, just because I'm trying
to keep this thing organized?


422
0:23:31,535 --> 0:23:33,746
Here, you take it.
You take on the responsibility.


423
0:23:33,746 --> 0:23:35,706
I'll just - I'll keep my mouth shut.
That's all.


424
0:23:35,706 --> 0:23:37,792
What are you getting so hot about?
Calm down, will you?


425
0:23:37,792 --> 0:23:39,21
Don't tell me to calm down.


426
0:23:39,21 --> 0:23:41,42
Here. You wanna take the chair,
just take the chair. That's all.


427
0:23:41,42 --> 0:23:43,964
- Did you ever see such a thing?
- See if you can keep it running.


428
0:23:43,964 --> 0:23:46,8
- Listen, you think it's funny or something?
- Hey, forget it, fella.


429
0:23:46,8 --> 0:23:47,676
The whole thing's unimportant.
Come on.


430
0:23:47,676 --> 0:23:50,888
- Unimportant? Oh, here, you try it.
- No, nobody wants to change.


431
0:23:50,888 --> 0:23:52,723
You're doing a beautiful job.
Sit down.


432
0:23:52,723 --> 0:23:55,643
Yeah, you're doing great.
Just great, fella.


433
0:23:55,643 --> 0:23:58,479
You stay in there and pitch. You know?


434
0:23:58,479 --> 0:24:2,191
All right. Let's hear from somebody.


435
0:24:2,191 --> 0:24:6,362
Well, if you want me to tell you how I
feel about it, it's all right with me.


436
0:24:6,362 --> 0:24:8,572
Boy, I don't care what you do.


437
0:24:8,572 --> 0:24:11,534
All right, I don't have anything brilliant.


438
0:24:11,534 --> 0:24:13,744
I only know as much as you do.


439
0:24:13,744 --> 0:24:17,581
According to the testimony,
the boy looks guilty. Maybe he is.


440
0:24:17,581 --> 0:24:22,378
I sat there in court for six days
listening while the evidence built up.


441
0:24:22,378 --> 0:24:24,171
Everybody sounded so positive, you know?


442
0:24:24,171 --> 0:24:26,715
I-I began to get a peculiar feeling
about this trial.


443
0:24:26,715 --> 0:24:28,884
I mean, nothing is that positive.


444
0:24:28,884 --> 0:24:31,95
There are a lot of questions
I'd have liked to ask.


445
0:24:31,95 --> 0:24:33,889
I don't know. Maybe they wouldn't
have meant anything, but...


446
0:24:33,889 --> 0:24:35,933
I began to get the feeling
that the defense counsel...


447
0:24:35,933 --> 0:24:38,519
wasn't conducting a thorough-enough
cross-examination.


448
0:24:38,519 --> 0:24:41,981
I mean, he - he let too many things go by,
little things that...


449
0:24:41,981 --> 0:24:44,817
What little things? Listen,
when these fellas don't ask questions...


450
0:24:44,817 --> 0:24:47,403
it's because they know the answers already
and they figure they'll be hurt.


451
0:24:47,403 --> 0:24:51,407
Maybe it's also possible for a lawyer
to be just plain stupid, isn't it?


452
0:24:51,407 --> 0:24:52,783
I mean it's possible.


453
0:24:52,783 --> 0:24:57,538
You sound like you met
my brother-in-law once.


454
0:24:57,538 --> 0:25:2,84
I - I kept putting myself
in the kid's place.


455
0:25:2,84 --> 0:25:4,295
I'd have asked for another lawyer, I think.


456
0:25:4,295 --> 0:25:6,922
I mean, if I was on trial for my life...


457
0:25:6,922 --> 0:25:11,802
I'd want my lawyer to tear the prosecution
witnesses to shreds, or at least try to.


458
0:25:11,802 --> 0:25:16,307
Look, there was one alleged eyewitness
to this killing.


459
0:25:16,307 --> 0:25:19,768
Someone else claims he heard the killing,
saw the boy run out afterwards.


460
0:25:19,768 --> 0:25:21,979
And there was a lot
of circumstantial evidence.


461
0:25:21,979 --> 0:25:25,566
But actually, those two witnesses
were the entire case for the prosecution.


462
0:25:25,566 --> 0:25:27,443
Supposing they're wrong.


463
0:25:27,443 --> 0:25:29,32
What do you mean
supposing they're wrong?


464
0:25:29,32 --> 0:25:31,28
What's the point
of having witnesses at all?


465
0:25:31,28 --> 0:25:33,991
- Could they be wrong?
- What are you trying to say?


466
0:25:33,991 --> 0:25:35,618
Those people sat on the stand under oath.


467
0:25:35,618 --> 0:25:37,244
They're only people.
People make mistakes.


468
0:25:37,244 --> 0:25:39,747
Could they be wrong?


469
0:25:39,747 --> 0:25:42,75
- Well, no, I don't think so.
- Do you know so?


470
0:25:42,75 --> 0:25:44,668
Oh, come on.
Nobody can know a thing like that.


471
0:25:44,668 --> 0:25:46,462
This isn't an exact science.


472
0:25:46,462 --> 0:25:52,968
That's right. It isn't.


473
0:25:52,968 --> 0:25:55,804
Okay, let - Let's get to the point.


474
0:25:55,804 --> 0:25:58,474
What about the switch knife
they found in the old man's chest?


475
0:25:58,474 --> 0:26:0,976
Uh, wait-wait a minute.
There's some people who haven't talked yet.


476
0:26:0,976 --> 0:26:3,62
- Shouldn't we go in order?
- They'll get a chance to talk.


477
0:26:3,62 --> 0:26:5,481
Be quiet a second, will you?


478
0:26:5,481 --> 0:26:6,857
What about it, this...


479
0:26:6,857 --> 0:26:10,402
the knife this fine upright boy
admitted buying the night of the killing?


480
0:26:10,402 --> 0:26:11,82
Let's talk about it.


481
0:26:11,82 --> 0:26:14,156
All right, let's talk about it.
Let's get it in here and look at it.


482
0:26:14,156 --> 0:26:15,991
I'd like to see it again.
Mr. Foreman?


483
0:26:15,991 --> 0:26:19,161
- We all saw what it looks like.
- Why do we have to see it again?


484
0:26:19,161 --> 0:26:23,332
The gentleman has a right
to see exhibits in evidence.


485
0:26:23,332 --> 0:26:24,875
Say, could you bring us the knife?


486
0:26:24,875 --> 0:26:28,337
- Knife?
- Yeah. Thank you.


487
0:26:28,337 --> 0:26:31,674
The knife and the way it was bought
is pretty strong evidence, don't you think?


488
0:26:31,674 --> 0:26:33,425
- I do.
- Good.


489
0:26:33,425 --> 0:26:36,11
Now, suppose we take these facts
one at a time.


490
0:26:36,11 --> 0:26:39,348
One. The boy admitted going out of the house
at 8:00 on the night of the murder...


491
0:26:39,348 --> 0:26:41,35
after being slapped several times
by his father.


492
0:26:41,35 --> 0:26:44,186
No, no. No, he didn't say "slapped."
He said "punched."


493
0:26:44,186 --> 0:26:46,689
There's a difference
between a slap and a punch.


494
0:26:46,689 --> 0:26:49,358
After being hit several times
by his father.


495
0:26:49,358 --> 0:26:51,694
Two. He went directly
to a neighborhood junk shop...


496
0:26:51,694 --> 0:26:53,904
- where he bought one of those -
- Switch knives.


497
0:26:53,904 --> 0:26:55,99
Switchblade knives.


498
0:26:55,99 --> 0:26:57,866
This wasn't what you'd call
an ordinary knife.


499
0:26:57,866 --> 0:27:0,452
It had a very unusual carved handle
and blade.


500
0:27:0,452 --> 0:27:2,37
The storekeeper who sold it to him...


501
0:27:2,37 --> 0:27:5,249
said it was the only one of its kind
he had ever had in stock.


502
0:27:5,249 --> 0:27:9,86
Three. He met some friends of his
in front of a tavern about 8:45.


503
0:27:9,86 --> 0:27:10,671
Am I right so far?


504
0:27:10,671 --> 0:27:12,881
- Yes, you are.
- You bet he is.


505
0:27:12,881 --> 0:27:16,135
He talked with his friends for about
an hour, leaving them at 9:45.


506
0:27:16,135 --> 0:27:19,179
During this time,
they saw the switch knife.


507
0:27:19,179 --> 0:27:21,56
Four.


508
0:27:21,56 --> 0:27:23,559
They identified the death weapon
in court...


509
0:27:23,559 --> 0:27:26,145
as that very same knife.


510
0:27:26,145 --> 0:27:29,23
Five. Î—e arrived home at about 10:00.


511
0:27:29,23 --> 0:27:31,442
Now this is where the stories
offered by the State and the boy...


512
0:27:31,442 --> 0:27:33,444
begin to diverge slightly.


513
0:27:33,444 --> 0:27:36,113
He claims that he went to a movie
at about 11:30...


514
0:27:36,113 --> 0:27:40,242
returning home at 3:10 to find his
father dead and himself arrested.


515
0:27:40,242 --> 0:27:42,369
He also claims that
the two detectives who arrested him...


516
0:27:42,369 --> 0:27:44,747
threw him down a half a flight of stairs.


517
0:27:44,747 --> 0:27:46,665
Now, what happened to the switch knife?


518
0:27:46,665 --> 0:27:49,376
He claims that it fell through a hole
in his pocket on the way to the movies...


519
0:27:49,376 --> 0:27:54,131
sometime between 11:30 and 3:10
and that he never saw it again.


520
0:27:54,131 --> 0:27:56,175
Now there's a tale, gentlemen.


521
0:27:56,175 --> 0:27:59,762
I think it's quite clear that the boy
never went to the movies that night.


522
0:27:59,762 --> 0:28:1,805
No one in the house
saw him go out at 11:30.


523
0:28:1,805 --> 0:28:3,39
No one at the theater identified him.


524
0:28:3,39 --> 0:28:8,562
He couldn't even remember
the names of the pictures he saw.


525
0:28:8,562 --> 0:28:10,356
- What actually happened is this.
- Thank you.


526
0:28:10,356 --> 0:28:13,65
The boy stayed home,
had another fight with his father...


527
0:28:13,65 --> 0:28:17,446
stabbed him to death and left the
house at 10 minutes after 12:00.


528
0:28:17,446 --> 0:28:20,282
He even remembered to wipe the knife
clean of fingerprints.


529
0:28:20,282 --> 0:28:22,993
Now are you trying to tell me
that this knife...


530
0:28:22,993 --> 0:28:24,995
really fell through a hole
in the boy's pocket...


531
0:28:24,995 --> 0:28:27,456
someone picked it up off the street,
went to the boy's house...


532
0:28:27,456 --> 0:28:30,209
and stabbed his father with it
just to test its sharpness?


533
0:28:30,209 --> 0:28:32,294
No. I'm just saying it's possible
the boy lost his knife...


534
0:28:32,294 --> 0:28:34,588
and that somebody else stabbed his father
with a similar knife.


535
0:28:34,588 --> 0:28:35,881
It's just possible.


536
0:28:35,881 --> 0:28:39,385
Take a look at this knife.


537
0:28:39,385 --> 0:28:41,678
It's a very unusual knife.


538
0:28:41,678 --> 0:28:43,305
I've never seen one like it.


539
0:28:43,305 --> 0:28:46,183
Neither had the storekeeper
who sold it to the boy.


540
0:28:46,183 --> 0:28:49,228
Aren't you asking us to accept
a pretty incredible coincidence?


541
0:28:49,228 --> 0:28:51,647
I'm just saying a coincidence is possible.


542
0:28:51,647 --> 0:28:59,78
And I say it's not possible.


543
0:28:59,78 --> 0:29:1,573
Where did that come from?


544
0:29:1,573 --> 0:29:3,33
- Where'd you get that?
- It's the same knife.


545
0:29:3,33 --> 0:29:4,618
What do you think you're doing?


546
0:29:4,618 --> 0:29:6,328
Where did you get it?


547
0:29:6,328 --> 0:29:8,664
I went out walking
for a couple of hours last night.


548
0:29:8,664 --> 0:29:10,749
I walked through the boy's neighborhood.


549
0:29:10,749 --> 0:29:13,836
I bought that at a little pawnshop
just two blocks from the boy's house.


550
0:29:13,836 --> 0:29:15,379
It cost six dollars.


551
0:29:15,379 --> 0:29:18,59
It's against the law
to buy or sell switchblade knives.


552
0:29:18,59 --> 0:29:20,926
That's right. I broke the law.


553
0:29:20,926 --> 0:29:25,13
Listen, you pulled a real bright trick.
Now, supposing you tell me what it proves.


554
0:29:25,13 --> 0:29:27,182
Maybe there are 10 knives like that.
So what?


555
0:29:27,182 --> 0:29:30,6
- Maybe there are.
- Well, what does it mean?


556
0:29:30,6 --> 0:29:33,439
You found another knife like it.
What's that, the discovery of the age or something?


557
0:29:33,439 --> 0:29:35,858
You mean you're asking us to believe
that somebody else did the stabbing...


558
0:29:35,858 --> 0:29:37,734
with exactly the same kind of knife?


559
0:29:37,734 --> 0:29:39,69
The odds are a million-to-one.


560
0:29:39,69 --> 0:29:42,99
- It's possible.
- But not very probable.


561
0:29:42,99 --> 0:29:45,75
Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.


562
0:29:45,75 --> 0:29:48,745
There's no point in standing around
all over the place.


563
0:29:48,745 --> 0:29:52,249
You know, it's interesting that he'd find a
knife exactly like the one the boy bought.


564
0:29:52,249 --> 0:29:55,85
What's interesting about it?
"Interesting."


565
0:29:55,85 --> 0:29:57,45
Well, I don't know.
I just thought it was interesting.


566
0:29:57,45 --> 0:29:58,922
There are still 11 of us here
who think he's guilty.


567
0:29:58,922 --> 0:30:1,3
- Right.
- What do you think you're gonna accomplish?


568
0:30:1,3 --> 0:30:3,218
You're not gonna change anybody's mind.


569
0:30:3,218 --> 0:30:5,679
So if you wanna be stubborn
and hang this jury, go ahead.


570
0:30:5,679 --> 0:30:10,267
The kid will be tried again
and found guilty sure as he's born.


571
0:30:10,267 --> 0:30:12,227
That's probably right.


572
0:30:12,227 --> 0:30:15,522
So what are you gonna do?
You know, we could be here all night.


573
0:30:15,522 --> 0:30:18,859
It's only one night. A boy may die.


574
0:30:18,859 --> 0:30:21,487
Well, why don't we just
set up house here, huh?


575
0:30:21,487 --> 0:30:24,31
Someone send for Potsy the policeman
and get a pinochle deck...


576
0:30:24,31 --> 0:30:28,35
and, uh, we'll just
sweat the whole thing out right here.


577
0:30:28,35 --> 0:30:31,163
- I don't think he ought to joke about it.
- What do you want me to do about it?


578
0:30:31,163 --> 0:30:34,917
Oh, listen! I don't see what all this stuff
about the knife's got to do with anything.


579
0:30:34,917 --> 0:30:37,92
Somebody saw the kid stab his father.
What more do we need?


580
0:30:37,92 --> 0:30:40,797
You guys can talk the ears right off my head.
You know what I mean?


581
0:30:40,797 --> 0:30:43,592
I got three garages of mine goin' to pot
while you're talking.


582
0:30:43,592 --> 0:30:45,344
So let's get done and get outta here.


583
0:30:45,344 --> 0:30:48,847
The knife was very important to the
district attorney. He spent a whole day...


584
0:30:48,847 --> 0:30:51,391
He's a 15th assistant or something.
What does he know about it?


585
0:30:51,391 --> 0:30:52,935
Hey, let's hold it down.


586
0:30:52,935 --> 0:30:58,148
These side arguments
are only slowing us up.


587
0:30:58,148 --> 0:30:59,608
Well, what about it?


588
0:30:59,608 --> 0:31:9,34
You're the only one.


589
0:31:9,34 --> 0:31:12,162
I have a proposition
to make to all of you.


590
0:31:12,162 --> 0:31:15,374
I'm gonna call for another vote.


591
0:31:15,374 --> 0:31:20,671
I want you 11 men to vote
by secret written ballot.


592
0:31:20,671 --> 0:31:22,798
I'll abstain.


593
0:31:22,798 --> 0:31:25,676
If there are 11 votes for guilty,
I won't stand alone.


594
0:31:25,676 --> 0:31:30,931
We'll take in a guilty verdict
to the judge right now.


595
0:31:30,931 --> 0:31:37,98
But if anyone votes not guilty,
we stay here and talk it out.


596
0:31:37,98 --> 0:31:40,983
Well, that's it.
If you want to try it, I'm ready.


597
0:31:40,983 --> 0:31:42,526
All right. Let's do it the hard way.


598
0:31:42,526 --> 0:31:44,528
Okay, that sounds fair.
Everyone agreed?


599
0:31:44,528 --> 0:31:46,697
- Anyone doesn't agree?
- Fine, fine. Let's go.


600
0:31:46,697 --> 0:31:47,823
Here, pass these along.


601
0:31:47,823 --> 0:32:21,648
Is that the right time?


602
0:32:21,648 --> 0:32:51,553
"Guilty."


603
0:32:51,553 --> 0:32:54,264
"Not guilty."


604
0:32:54,264 --> 0:32:55,766
"Guilty."


605
0:32:55,766 --> 0:32:57,517
Boy, how do you like that?


606
0:32:57,517 --> 0:33:0,62
Oh, and another chap flaps his wings.


607
0:33:0,62 --> 0:33:2,898
All right, who was it?
Come on. I want to know.


608
0:33:2,898 --> 0:33:5,233
Excuse me. This was a secret ballot.


609
0:33:5,233 --> 0:33:6,86
We all agreed on that, no?


610
0:33:6,86 --> 0:33:9,71
If the gentleman wanted
to remain secret...


611
0:33:9,71 --> 0:33:11,31
Secret? What do you mean secret?


612
0:33:11,31 --> 0:33:14,993
There are no secrets in a jury room.
I know who it was.


613
0:33:14,993 --> 0:33:16,995
Brother, you really are something.


614
0:33:16,995 --> 0:33:19,81
You sit here, vote guilty
like the rest of us...


615
0:33:19,81 --> 0:33:22,459
and then some golden-voiced preacher
starts tearin' your poor heart out...


616
0:33:22,459 --> 0:33:25,837
about some underprivileged kid
just couldn't help becomin' a murderer...


617
0:33:25,837 --> 0:33:27,422
and you change your vote.


618
0:33:27,422 --> 0:33:29,633
If that isn't the most sick...


619
0:33:29,633 --> 0:33:33,387
Why don't you drop a quarter
in his collection box?


620
0:33:33,387 --> 0:33:35,43
Oh, now just wait a minute.


621
0:33:35,43 --> 0:33:37,99
Listen, you can't talk to me like that.


622
0:33:37,99 --> 0:33:39,17
- No. Who do you think you are?
- Calm down. Calm down.


623
0:33:39,17 --> 0:33:41,436
No. Who does he think he is?
Did you hear him?


624
0:33:41,436 --> 0:33:44,981
- It doesn't matter. He's very excitable. Sit down.
- Excitable? You bet I'm excitable!


625
0:33:44,981 --> 0:33:47,901
We're trying to put a guilty man
in the chair where he belongs!


626
0:33:47,901 --> 0:33:50,654
Someone starts telling us fairy tales,
and we're listenin'!


627
0:33:50,654 --> 0:33:52,489
Hey, uh, come on, huh?


628
0:33:52,489 --> 0:33:54,491
What made you change your vote?


629
0:33:54,491 --> 0:33:56,201
He didn't change his vote.


630
0:33:56,201 --> 0:33:57,452
I did.


631
0:33:57,452 --> 0:33:59,496
- Oh, fine.
- I knew it.


632
0:33:59,496 --> 0:34:1,54
Would you like me to tell you why?


633
0:34:1,54 --> 0:34:3,5
No, I wouldn't like you to tell me why.


634
0:34:3,5 --> 0:34:6,128
I'd like to make it clear anyway,
if you don't mind.


635
0:34:6,128 --> 0:34:7,713
Do we have to listen to this?


636
0:34:7,713 --> 0:34:9,548
The man wants to talk.


637
0:34:9,548 --> 0:34:11,216
Thank you.


638
0:34:11,216 --> 0:34:14,636
This gentleman has been
standing alone against us.


639
0:34:14,636 --> 0:34:16,972
Now, he doesn't say
the boy is not guilty.


640
0:34:16,972 --> 0:34:19,15
He just isn't sure.


641
0:34:19,15 --> 0:34:21,935
Well, it's not easy to stand alone
against the ridicule of others.


642
0:34:21,935 --> 0:34:25,147
So he gambled for support,
and I gave it to him.


643
0:34:25,147 --> 0:34:26,94
I respect his motives.


644
0:34:26,94 --> 0:34:31,57
The boy on trial is probably guilty,
but, uh, I want to hear more.


645
0:34:31,57 --> 0:34:33,447
Right now, the vote is 10 to two.


646
0:34:33,447 --> 0:34:35,782
I'm talking here!
You have no right to leave this room!


647
0:34:35,782 --> 0:34:37,743
He can't hear you. He never will.


648
0:34:37,743 --> 0:34:43,498
Let's sit down.


649
0:34:43,498 --> 0:34:45,792
Shall we continue?


650
0:34:45,792 --> 0:34:48,86
Well, I - I think we ought
to take a break.


651
0:34:48,86 --> 0:34:52,299
You know, one man's inside,
and I think we ought to wait for him.


652
0:34:52,299 --> 0:34:55,343
Okay.


653
0:34:55,343 --> 0:34:58,472
Looks like we're really
hung up here, huh?


654
0:34:58,472 --> 0:35:2,893
And that thing with the old man,
that was pretty unexpected.


655
0:35:2,893 --> 0:35:8,482
I wish I could figure out some way
we could break it up.


656
0:35:8,482 --> 0:35:12,27
You know, in advertising -
I told you I worked in an agency.


657
0:35:12,27 --> 0:35:13,111
Mm-hmm.


658
0:35:13,111 --> 0:35:15,197
Well, there's some pretty strange people
working there.


659
0:35:15,197 --> 0:35:17,365
Well, they're not strange really, I guess.


660
0:35:17,365 --> 0:35:20,76
It's just that they have peculiar ways
of expressing themselves.


661
0:35:20,76 --> 0:35:21,411
You know what I mean.


662
0:35:21,411 --> 0:35:24,372
Of course, I suppose it's the same
in your business too, huh?


663
0:35:24,372 --> 0:35:25,957
What do you do?


664
0:35:25,957 --> 0:35:28,21
- I'm a watchmaker.
- Oh, really?


665
0:35:28,21 --> 0:35:31,505
Well, I imagine the finest watchmakers
in the world come from Europe, huh?


666
0:35:31,505 --> 0:35:34,591
Anyway, as I was telling you, in an
agency, when we reach a point like this...


667
0:35:34,591 --> 0:35:38,178
I'm telling him about, in an ad agency, when
a point like this is reached in a meeting...


668
0:35:38,178 --> 0:35:40,889
there's always some character
ready with an idea, see.


669
0:35:40,889 --> 0:35:42,933
And it kills me.


670
0:35:42,933 --> 0:35:44,518
It's the weirdest thing in the world...


671
0:35:44,518 --> 0:35:47,938
the way they sometimes precede their idea
with a little phrase, see, like...


672
0:35:47,938 --> 0:35:50,941
Some account exec will get up,
and he'll say, uh...


673
0:35:50,941 --> 0:35:52,859
"Okay, here's an idea.


674
0:35:52,859 --> 0:35:56,571
Let's, uh, run it up the flagpole
and see if anyone salutes it."


675
0:35:56,571 --> 0:35:59,783
I mean, it's idiotic, but it's funny, huh?


676
0:35:59,783 --> 0:36:5,288
I, uh
- I got a little excited back there. I...


677
0:36:5,288 --> 0:36:7,916
didn't mean to get nasty.


678
0:36:7,916 --> 0:36:12,879
I'm glad you're not one of those
lets these emotional appeals influence him.


679
0:36:12,879 --> 0:36:28,395
Uh...


680
0:36:28,395 --> 0:36:32,482
I don't know what's the matter with that fan.
Can't seem to get it to start.


681
0:36:32,482 --> 0:36:35,11
â™ª Be, be, be â™ª


682
0:36:35,11 --> 0:36:37,779
â™ª Ba, ba, ba, ba, bum â™ªâ™ª


683
0:36:37,779 --> 0:36:40,824
Eh!


684
0:36:40,824 --> 0:36:43,118
Hey, you a salesman?


685
0:36:43,118 --> 0:36:45,453
I'm an architect.


686
0:36:45,453 --> 0:36:46,872
Hmm.


687
0:36:46,872 --> 0:36:52,43
You know what the soft sell is?


688
0:36:52,43 --> 0:36:55,63
Boy, you got it. Believe me.


689
0:36:55,63 --> 0:36:58,133
I got a different technique.


690
0:36:58,133 --> 0:37:0,1
Laughs, drinks, jokes.


691
0:37:0,1 --> 0:37:3,96
Tricks. You know?


692
0:37:3,96 --> 0:37:5,765
Yeah.


693
0:37:5,765 --> 0:37:9,394
"Hit 'em where they live."
That's my motto.


694
0:37:9,394 --> 0:37:12,981
I made 27 grand last year
sellin' marmalade.


695
0:37:12,981 --> 0:37:18,695
That's not bad. I mean,
you know, considering marmalade.


696
0:37:18,695 --> 0:37:22,657
Hey, what are you
gettin' outta this - kicks?


697
0:37:22,657 --> 0:37:25,327
Or did somebody bump you on the head
one time and you haven't gotten over it?


698
0:37:25,327 --> 0:37:28,38
Maybe.


699
0:37:28,38 --> 0:37:30,665
You know, you do-gooders are all alike.


700
0:37:30,665 --> 0:37:36,421
You're always blowing your stacks
over some guy that fanned.


701
0:37:36,421 --> 0:37:39,7
But what are you wasting our time for?


702
0:37:39,7 --> 0:37:46,348
Why don't you donate five dollars to the
cause, and maybe it'll make you feel better.


703
0:37:46,348 --> 0:37:48,683
This kid is guilty, pal.


704
0:37:48,683 --> 0:37:51,186
It's as plain as the nose on your face.


705
0:37:51,186 --> 0:37:53,521
So why don't we stop
wasting our time here?


706
0:37:53,521 --> 0:37:56,524
We're gonna all get sore throats
if we keep it up, you know?


707
0:37:56,524 --> 0:37:59,861
What difference does it make
if you get it here or at the ball game?


708
0:37:59,861 --> 0:38:2,864
Oh, no difference, pal.


709
0:38:2,864 --> 0:38:16,586
No difference at all.


710
0:38:16,586 --> 0:38:18,546
Nice bunch of guys, huh?


711
0:38:18,546 --> 0:38:20,924
Oh, they're about the same
as anyone else.


712
0:38:20,924 --> 0:38:24,719
Phew! Boy, what a murderous day.


713
0:38:24,719 --> 0:38:26,846
You think we'll be much longer?


714
0:38:26,846 --> 0:38:28,556
I don't know.


715
0:38:28,556 --> 0:38:30,558
Aw, he's guilty for sure.


716
0:38:30,558 --> 0:38:32,185
Not a doubt in the whole world.


717
0:38:32,185 --> 0:38:36,982
We should -
Should've been done already.


718
0:38:36,982 --> 0:38:38,316
Oh, I don't mind, you know.


719
0:38:38,316 --> 0:38:44,406
Hmm. Beats workin'.


720
0:38:44,406 --> 0:38:47,951
Uh...


721
0:38:47,951 --> 0:38:50,12
You think he's not guilty, huh?


722
0:38:50,12 --> 0:38:52,706
I don't know. It's possible.


723
0:38:52,706 --> 0:38:56,584
Well, I don't know you, but I'm bettin'
you never been wronger in your life.


724
0:38:56,584 --> 0:38:59,87
You're wasting your time.
You ought to wrap it up.


725
0:38:59,87 --> 0:39:2,9
Supposing you were the one
who was on trial.


726
0:39:2,9 --> 0:39:4,5
Well, I'm not used to supposing.


727
0:39:4,5 --> 0:39:8,638
I'm just a workingman.
My boss does the supposing. But...


728
0:39:8,638 --> 0:39:11,349
Well, I'll try one.


729
0:39:11,349 --> 0:39:25,947
Supposing you talk us all out of this, and,
uh, the kid really did knife his father. Huh?


730
0:39:25,947 --> 0:39:27,323
Are you ready?


731
0:39:27,323 --> 0:39:28,616
Hup.


732
0:39:28,616 --> 0:39:29,617
That one.


733
0:39:29,617 --> 0:39:32,203
Sorry, blue eyes.


734
0:39:32,203 --> 0:39:35,707
- Well, where else -
- Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.


735
0:39:35,707 --> 0:39:37,709
Looks like we'll be here
for dinner, huh?


736
0:39:37,709 --> 0:39:40,17
Okay, now let's -
Let's get down to business.


737
0:39:40,17 --> 0:39:41,629
Now, who wants to start it off?


738
0:39:41,629 --> 0:39:43,131
- I would.
- Okay, go.


739
0:39:43,131 --> 0:39:45,3
You down there.


740
0:39:45,3 --> 0:39:49,262
The old man who lived downstairs says he
heard the kid yell out, "I'm gonna kill ya."


741
0:39:49,262 --> 0:39:51,973
A second later,
he heard the body hit the floor.


742
0:39:51,973 --> 0:39:55,935
Now, he ran to the door and he saw the kid
running down the stairs and out of the house.


743
0:39:55,935 --> 0:39:57,395
What does that mean to you?


744
0:39:57,395 --> 0:40:0,857
I was wondering how clearly the old man could
have heard the boy's voice through the ceiling.


745
0:40:0,857 --> 0:40:2,984
He didn't hear it through the ceiling.
The window was open.


746
0:40:2,984 --> 0:40:4,903
So was the one upstairs.
It was a hot night, remember?


747
0:40:4,903 --> 0:40:6,321
Well, it was another apartment.


748
0:40:6,321 --> 0:40:8,99
It's not that easy to identify a voice,
particularly a shouting voice.


749
0:40:8,99 --> 0:40:10,658
- He identified it in court.
- That's right.


750
0:40:10,658 --> 0:40:12,202
And don't forget the lady
across the street.


751
0:40:12,202 --> 0:40:15,8
She looked right in the open window
and saw the boy stab his father.


752
0:40:15,8 --> 0:40:17,624
- Now, I mean, isn't that enough for you?
- No, it isn't.


753
0:40:17,624 --> 0:40:19,667
Boy, how do you like this guy, huh?


754
0:40:19,667 --> 0:40:21,586
It's like talking into a dead phone.


755
0:40:21,586 --> 0:40:24,839
She said she saw the killing through the
windows of a moving elevated train.


756
0:40:24,839 --> 0:40:28,426
There were six cars on the train.
She saw the killing through the last two cars.


757
0:40:28,426 --> 0:40:30,345
She remembered
the most insignificant details.


758
0:40:30,345 --> 0:40:32,472
I don't see how you can argue with that.


759
0:40:32,472 --> 0:40:45,693
Has anybody here any idea
how long it would take an el...


760
0:40:45,693 --> 0:40:47,362
Hey!


761
0:40:47,362 --> 0:40:53,159
This isn't a game.


762
0:40:53,159 --> 0:40:55,495
- Did you see him?
- Hey.


763
0:40:55,495 --> 0:40:57,33
- The nerve.
- All right, listen...


764
0:40:57,33 --> 0:41:0,667
- The absolute nerve.
- Forget it. It's not important.


765
0:41:0,667 --> 0:41:2,71
- "This isn't a game"?
- Calm down.


766
0:41:2,71 --> 0:41:6,131
- Who does he think he is?
- I'm telling you, forget it now.


767
0:41:6,131 --> 0:41:9,551
Has anybody any idea how long
it takes an elevated train...


768
0:41:9,551 --> 0:41:11,469
going at medium speed
to pass a given point?


769
0:41:11,469 --> 0:41:13,429
- What has that to do with anything?
- How long? Take a guess.


770
0:41:13,429 --> 0:41:16,182
- I wouldn't have the slightest idea.
- What do you think?


771
0:41:16,182 --> 0:41:19,6
I don't know. Maybe 10, 12 seconds?


772
0:41:19,6 --> 0:41:20,812
I think that's a pretty good guess.
Anyone else?


773
0:41:20,812 --> 0:41:23,69
- That sounds right to me.
- Come on. What's the guessing game for?


774
0:41:23,69 --> 0:41:25,608
- What do you say?
- Ten seconds is about right.


775
0:41:25,608 --> 0:41:27,61
All right. Say 10 seconds.
What are you getting at?


776
0:41:27,61 --> 0:41:32,74
This. It takes a six-car el train
10 seconds to pass a given point.


777
0:41:32,74 --> 0:41:37,78
Now let's say the given point is the open window
of the room where the killing took place.


778
0:41:37,78 --> 0:41:40,456
You can reach out of that window
and almost touch the el tracks, right?


779
0:41:40,456 --> 0:41:42,41
Now let me ask you this.


780
0:41:42,41 --> 0:41:44,377
Has anyone here
ever lived near the el tracks?


781
0:41:44,377 --> 0:41:48,89
Well, uh, I just finished painting an
apartment that overlooked an el line.


782
0:41:48,89 --> 0:41:49,841
- I was there for three days.
- What was it like?


783
0:41:49,841 --> 0:41:51,92
- What do you mean?
- Noisy?


784
0:41:51,92 --> 0:41:53,72
Oh, brother. Don't matter though.
We were all punchy.


785
0:41:53,72 --> 0:41:56,389
I lived in a second-floor apartment
near the el line once.


786
0:41:56,389 --> 0:41:59,559
When the window was open and the train
goes by, the noise is almost unbearable.


787
0:41:59,559 --> 0:42:2,437
- You can hardly hear yourself think.
- All right, you can't hear yourself think.


788
0:42:2,437 --> 0:42:4,939
- Will you get to the point?
- I will. Now just a minute.


789
0:42:4,939 --> 0:42:8,651
Let's take two pieces of testimony
and try to put them together.


790
0:42:8,651 --> 0:42:12,822
First. The old man in the
apartment downstairs.


791
0:42:12,822 --> 0:42:15,491
He says he heard the boy say
"I'm gonna kill you"...


792
0:42:15,491 --> 0:42:18,328
and a split second later
heard a body hit the floor.


793
0:42:18,328 --> 0:42:19,996
- One second later, right?
- That's right.


794
0:42:19,996 --> 0:42:26,85
Second. The woman across the street swore
positively she looked out of the window...


795
0:42:26,85 --> 0:42:29,505
and saw the killing through the last two
cars of the passing elevated train, right?


796
0:42:29,505 --> 0:42:31,925
- The last two cars.
- What are you giving us here?


797
0:42:31,925 --> 0:42:33,343
Now, just a minute.


798
0:42:33,343 --> 0:42:38,598
We've agreed that it takes 10 seconds
for a train to pass a given point.


799
0:42:38,598 --> 0:42:42,18
Since the woman saw the killing
through the last two cars...


800
0:42:42,18 --> 0:42:47,65
we can assume that the body
hit the floor just as the train went by.


801
0:42:47,65 --> 0:42:51,611
Therefore, the train had been roaring
by the old man's window...


802
0:42:51,611 --> 0:42:55,198
a full 10 seconds
before the body hit the floor.


803
0:42:55,198 --> 0:42:57,492
The old man,
according to his own testimony...


804
0:42:57,492 --> 0:43:0,495
"I'm gonna kill you," body hitting
the floor a split second later...


805
0:43:0,495 --> 0:43:3,39
would have had to hear the boy
make this statement...


806
0:43:3,39 --> 0:43:4,999
with the el roaring past his nose.


807
0:43:4,999 --> 0:43:6,626
It's not possible he could've heard it.


808
0:43:6,626 --> 0:43:8,878
- That's idiotic. Of course he heard it.
- Do you think he could've heard it?


809
0:43:8,878 --> 0:43:11,339
He said he yelled at the top of his voice.
That's good enough for me.


810
0:43:11,339 --> 0:43:13,675
Even if he heard something, he still
couldn't have identified the voice.


811
0:43:13,675 --> 0:43:14,884
With the el roaring by?


812
0:43:14,884 --> 0:43:17,345
You're talking about a matter of seconds!
Nobody can be that accurate.


813
0:43:17,345 --> 0:43:24,185
I think testimony that could put a boy into
the electric chair should be that accurate.


814
0:43:24,185 --> 0:43:26,187
You know something?
I don't think he could've heard it.


815
0:43:26,187 --> 0:43:28,606
Maybe he didn't hear it.
I mean, with all that el noise.


816
0:43:28,606 --> 0:43:30,566
Oh, what are you people talking about?


817
0:43:30,566 --> 0:43:32,694
Well, it stands to reason
he couldn't have heard it.


818
0:43:32,694 --> 0:43:34,696
Why should he lie?
What's he got to gain?


819
0:43:34,696 --> 0:43:36,99
Attention maybe.


820
0:43:36,99 --> 0:43:38,992
You keep coming in
with these bright sayings!


821
0:43:38,992 --> 0:43:42,12
Why don't you send 'em in to a paper?
They pay three dollars apiece.


822
0:43:42,12 --> 0:43:45,29
What are you talking to him
like that for?


823
0:43:45,29 --> 0:43:48,793
Guy talks like that to an old man
really ought to get stepped on, you know?


824
0:43:48,793 --> 0:43:51,838
You ought to have more respect, mister.


825
0:43:51,838 --> 0:44:6,185
If you say stuff like that to him again,
I'm gonna lay you out.


826
0:44:6,185 --> 0:44:9,23
Now you go ahead.
You - You say anything you like.


827
0:44:9,23 --> 0:44:13,359
Why do you think
the old man might lie?


828
0:44:13,359 --> 0:44:17,405
It was just that I looked at him
for a very long time.


829
0:44:17,405 --> 0:44:20,742
The seams of his jacket was split,
under the shoulder.


830
0:44:20,742 --> 0:44:22,41
Or did you notice that?


831
0:44:22,41 --> 0:44:24,996
I mean, to come to court like that.


832
0:44:24,996 --> 0:44:27,79
Why...


833
0:44:27,79 --> 0:44:31,753
He was a very old man
in a torn jacket.


834
0:44:31,753 --> 0:44:35,381
And he walked very slowly
to the stand.


835
0:44:35,381 --> 0:44:39,51
He was dragging his left leg
and trying to hide it...


836
0:44:39,51 --> 0:44:42,305
because he was ashamed.


837
0:44:42,305 --> 0:44:46,601
I think I know this man
better than anyone here.


838
0:44:46,601 --> 0:44:52,106
This is a quiet, frightened,
insignificant old man who...


839
0:44:52,106 --> 0:44:54,567
who has been nothing all his life...


840
0:44:54,567 --> 0:44:57,7
who has never had recognition...


841
0:44:57,7 --> 0:44:59,822
or his name in the newspapers.


842
0:44:59,822 --> 0:45:2,116
Nobody knows him.


843
0:45:2,116 --> 0:45:4,243
Nobody quotes him.


844
0:45:4,243 --> 0:45:9,4
Nobody seeks his advice after 75 years.


845
0:45:9,4 --> 0:45:13,628
Gentlemen, that's a very sad thing -
to be nothing.


846
0:45:13,628 --> 0:45:18,591
A man like this needs to be quoted,
to be listened to.


847
0:45:18,591 --> 0:45:20,635
To be quoted just once.


848
0:45:20,635 --> 0:45:23,12
Very important to him.


849
0:45:23,12 --> 0:45:25,515
It would be so hard for him
to recede into the background...


850
0:45:25,515 --> 0:45:27,308
- Wait a minute.
- When there was a chance...


851
0:45:27,308 --> 0:45:30,269
What are you trying to do - tell us he'd
lie just so he could be important once?


852
0:45:30,269 --> 0:45:32,98
No. He wouldn't really lie.


853
0:45:32,98 --> 0:45:36,526
But perhaps he made himself believe
he heard those words...


854
0:45:36,526 --> 0:45:38,82
and recognized the boy's face.


855
0:45:38,82 --> 0:45:41,197
That's the most fantastic story
I've ever heard.


856
0:45:41,197 --> 0:45:53,292
How can you make up a thing like that?
What do you know about it?


857
0:45:53,292 --> 0:45:55,42
Oh, uh, does anybody
want a cough drop?


858
0:45:55,42 --> 0:45:57,755
- No, thanks.
- I'll take one.


859
0:45:57,755 --> 0:46:1,342
You can say what you like. I still don't
see how anybody can think he's not guilty.


860
0:46:1,342 --> 0:46:3,928
There's something else
I'd like to talk about for a minute.


861
0:46:3,928 --> 0:46:5,638
Thanks.


862
0:46:5,638 --> 0:46:9,16
I think we've proved that the old man couldn't
have heard the boy say "I'm gonna kill you."


863
0:46:9,16 --> 0:46:10,685
- But supposing -
- You didn't prove it at all.


864
0:46:10,685 --> 0:46:13,563
- What are you talking about?
- Supposing he really did hear it.


865
0:46:13,563 --> 0:46:16,65
This phrase, how many times
have all of us used it?


866
0:46:16,65 --> 0:46:17,65
Probably thousands.


867
0:46:17,65 --> 0:46:19,36
"I could kill you for that, darling."


868
0:46:19,36 --> 0:46:21,362
"Junior, you do that once more,
and I'm gonna kill you."


869
0:46:21,362 --> 0:46:22,738
"Get in there, Rocky, and kill him."


870
0:46:22,738 --> 0:46:24,699
We say it every day. That doesn't mean
we're really gonna kill anybody.


871
0:46:24,699 --> 0:46:26,576
Wait a minute.
What are you trying to give us here?


872
0:46:26,576 --> 0:46:30,371
The phrase was "I'm gonna kill you."
The kid yelled it at the top of his lungs.


873
0:46:30,371 --> 0:46:31,789
Don't tell me he didn't mean it.


874
0:46:31,789 --> 0:46:34,167
Anybody says a thing like that
the way he said it, they mean it.


875
0:46:34,167 --> 0:46:35,71
Well, gee, now I don't know.


876
0:46:35,71 --> 0:46:40,506
I remember I was arguing with a guy I work
next to at the bank a couple weeks ago.


877
0:46:40,506 --> 0:46:42,341
He called me an idiot, so I yelled at him.


878
0:46:42,341 --> 0:46:45,386
Now listen! This guy's trying to make you
believe things that aren't so.


879
0:46:45,386 --> 0:46:47,555
The kid said he was gonna kill him,
and he did kill him.


880
0:46:47,555 --> 0:46:50,6
Let me ask you this. Do you really think the
boy would shout out a thing like that...


881
0:46:50,6 --> 0:46:52,477
so the whole neighborhood could hear him?


882
0:46:52,477 --> 0:46:54,395
I don't think so.
He's much too bright for that.


883
0:46:54,395 --> 0:46:59,233
Bright? He's a common ignorant slob.
He don't even speak good English.


884
0:46:59,233 --> 0:47:4,53
"He doesn't even speak good English."


885
0:47:4,53 --> 0:47:8,409
Mr. Foreman, I'd like
to change my vote to not guilty.


886
0:47:8,409 --> 0:47:9,911
You what?


887
0:47:9,911 --> 0:47:13,247
- You heard me.
- Are you sure?


888
0:47:13,247 --> 0:47:14,749
Yeah, I'm sure.


889
0:47:14,749 --> 0:47:17,293
The vote is nine to three,
favor of guilty.


890
0:47:17,293 --> 0:47:24,133
Well, if this isn't the living end. Huh?


891
0:47:24,133 --> 0:47:27,512
What are you basing it on -
the stories this guy made up?


892
0:47:27,512 --> 0:47:29,931
You ought to write for one of those
kooky detective magazines.


893
0:47:29,931 --> 0:47:31,849
You'd make a fortune.


894
0:47:31,849 --> 0:47:35,77
For crying out loud. The kid's own lawyer
knew he didn't stand a chance.


895
0:47:35,77 --> 0:47:37,438
Right from the beginning,
his own lawyer knew it.


896
0:47:37,438 --> 0:47:39,315
You could see it.


897
0:47:39,315 --> 0:47:43,736
Boy, oh, boy. I'm tellin' you,
this guy here is really something.


898
0:47:43,736 --> 0:47:45,613
Look, the kid had a lawyer, didn't he?


899
0:47:45,613 --> 0:47:48,533
He presented his case, not you.
How come you got so much to say?


900
0:47:48,533 --> 0:47:51,452
- Look, lawyers aren't infallible, you know.
- Baltimore, please. Huh?


901
0:47:51,452 --> 0:47:53,246
He was court-appointed.


902
0:47:53,246 --> 0:47:55,164
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It could mean a lot of things.


903
0:47:55,164 --> 0:47:58,501
It could mean he didn't want the case,
or he resented being appointed.


904
0:47:58,501 --> 0:48:0,419
It's the kind of case
that brings him nothing...


905
0:48:0,419 --> 0:48:3,464
no money, no glory,
not even much chance of winning.


906
0:48:3,464 --> 0:48:6,467
That's not a very promising situation
for a young lawyer.


907
0:48:6,467 --> 0:48:9,47
He'd really have to believe in his client
to put up any kind of a good case...


908
0:48:9,47 --> 0:48:11,556
and, as you pointed out a minute ago,
obviously he didn't.


909
0:48:11,556 --> 0:48:14,475
Of course he didn't. Huh.


910
0:48:14,475 --> 0:48:16,852
Who the heck could?


911
0:48:16,852 --> 0:48:19,855
Except maybe
some guy's mother or somebody. I...


912
0:48:19,855 --> 0:48:22,191
Ah, look.
Will you look at the time, huh?


913
0:48:22,191 --> 0:48:24,819
- Come on. For crying out -
- Pardon me.


914
0:48:24,819 --> 0:48:27,238
- I have made some notes here -
- Notes.


915
0:48:27,238 --> 0:48:29,949
And I would like to -
please, to say something.


916
0:48:29,949 --> 0:48:32,285
- Yeah.
- I have been listening very carefully.


917
0:48:32,285 --> 0:48:36,789
And, uh, it seems to me that this man
has some very good points to make.


918
0:48:36,789 --> 0:48:41,502
From what was presented at the trial,
the boy looks guilty on the surface.


919
0:48:41,502 --> 0:48:45,673
- But maybe if we go deeper?
- Oh, come on, will ya?


920
0:48:45,673 --> 0:48:48,5
There is a question I would like to ask.


921
0:48:48,5 --> 0:48:51,429
Let us assume that the boy
really did commit the murder.


922
0:48:51,429 --> 0:48:54,849
Now, this happened
at 10 minutes after 12:00.


923
0:48:54,849 --> 0:48:57,393
Now, how was he caught by the police?


924
0:48:57,393 --> 0:49:1,981
He came back home, uh, at 3:00 or so...


925
0:49:1,981 --> 0:49:5,818
and he was captured by two detectives
in the hallway of his house.


926
0:49:5,818 --> 0:49:10,489
Now, my question is,
if he really had killed his father...


927
0:49:10,489 --> 0:49:13,784
why would he come back home
three hours later?


928
0:49:13,784 --> 0:49:16,746
Wouldn't he be afraid of being caught?


929
0:49:16,746 --> 0:49:18,581
He came home to get his knife.


930
0:49:18,581 --> 0:49:21,208
It's not nice to go around leaving knives
sticking in people's chests.


931
0:49:21,208 --> 0:49:24,45
- Yeah, especially relatives.
- Yeah.


932
0:49:24,45 --> 0:49:26,38
I don't see anything funny about it.


933
0:49:26,38 --> 0:49:30,9
The boy knew the knife could be identified
as the one he had just bought.


934
0:49:30,9 --> 0:49:32,261
He had to get it before the police did.


935
0:49:32,261 --> 0:49:37,266
But if he knew the knife could be identified,
why did he leave it there in the first place?


936
0:49:37,266 --> 0:49:40,227
Well, I think we can assume
the boy ran out in a state of panic...


937
0:49:40,227 --> 0:49:42,688
after having just killed his father.


938
0:49:42,688 --> 0:49:45,733
When he finally calmed down,
he realized he had left his knife there.


939
0:49:45,733 --> 0:49:48,736
Ah. This then depends
on your definition of panic.


940
0:49:48,736 --> 0:49:51,197
He would have had to be
calm enough to see to it...


941
0:49:51,197 --> 0:49:53,866
that there were no fingerprints
left on the knife.


942
0:49:53,866 --> 0:49:57,995
Now, where did this panic start
and where did it end?


943
0:49:57,995 --> 0:50:0,456
Look, you voted guilty.
What side are ya on?


944
0:50:0,456 --> 0:50:4,85
I don't believe I have to be loyal
to one side or the other.


945
0:50:4,85 --> 0:50:5,961
I'm simply asking questions.


946
0:50:5,961 --> 0:50:9,48
Well, this is just off the top of my head,
but, uh...


947
0:50:9,48 --> 0:50:11,634
well, if I were the boy
and I'd done the stabbing and everything...


948
0:50:11,634 --> 0:50:13,844
I'd take a chance
and go back for the knife.


949
0:50:13,844 --> 0:50:16,43
I'll bet he figured that nobody
had seen him running out...


950
0:50:16,43 --> 0:50:19,16
and that the body wouldn't be discovered
till the next day.


951
0:50:19,16 --> 0:50:21,143
Well, after all,
it was the middle of the night.


952
0:50:21,143 --> 0:50:23,729
I'll bet he'd figured nobody
would find the body till the next day.


953
0:50:23,729 --> 0:50:25,815
Pardon. This is my whole point.


954
0:50:25,815 --> 0:50:29,61
The woman across the street testified that
the moment after she saw the killing...


955
0:50:29,61 --> 0:50:32,279
that is, a moment
after the train went by...


956
0:50:32,279 --> 0:50:35,366
she screamed
and then went to telephone the police.


957
0:50:35,366 --> 0:50:38,828
Now, the boy certainly
must have heard the scream...


958
0:50:38,828 --> 0:50:42,415
so he knew
that somebody saw something.


959
0:50:42,415 --> 0:50:45,292
I just don't think
that he would have gone back.


960
0:50:45,292 --> 0:50:48,129
Two things. One, in his state of panic,
he may not have heard the scream.


961
0:50:48,129 --> 0:50:49,88
Perhaps it wasn't very loud.


962
0:50:49,88 --> 0:50:53,342
Two, if he did hear it, he may not
have connected it with his own act.


963
0:50:53,342 --> 0:50:56,47
Remember, he lived in a neighborhood
where screams were fairly commonplace.


964
0:50:56,47 --> 0:50:59,14
- There's your answer.
- Maybe.


965
0:50:59,14 --> 0:51:1,976
Maybe the boy did kill his father,
didn't hear the scream...


966
0:51:1,976 --> 0:51:5,771
did run out in a panic,
did calm down three hours later...


967
0:51:5,771 --> 0:51:8,482
and come back to get the knife,
risking being caught by the police.


968
0:51:8,482 --> 0:51:11,485
Maybe all of those things happened,
but maybe they didn't.


969
0:51:11,485 --> 0:51:14,321
I think there's enough doubt that we can
wonder whether he was there at all...


970
0:51:14,321 --> 0:51:16,73
during the time the killing took place.


971
0:51:16,73 --> 0:51:17,908
What do you mean doubt?
What are you talking about?


972
0:51:17,908 --> 0:51:19,702
Didn't the old man see him
running out of the house?


973
0:51:19,702 --> 0:51:21,579
He's twisting the facts, I'm telling you.


974
0:51:21,579 --> 0:51:24,999
Did or didn't the old man see the kid
running out of the house at 12:10?


975
0:51:24,999 --> 0:51:27,1
Well, did or didn't he?


976
0:51:27,1 --> 0:51:30,296
- He says he did.
- "Says he did"? Boy! How do you like that?


977
0:51:30,296 --> 0:51:33,34
- Now, look, witnesses can make mistakes.
- Sure, when you want them to, they do.


978
0:51:33,34 --> 0:51:35,676
Or when he wants them to, they do.
You know what I mean?


979
0:51:35,676 --> 0:51:37,595
- Keep the yelling down!
- Oh, you keep saying that.


980
0:51:37,595 --> 0:51:39,388
Maybe what we need
is a little yelling in here.


981
0:51:39,388 --> 0:51:41,182
These guys
keep going off every which way.


982
0:51:41,182 --> 0:51:43,184
Did hear the scream.
Didn't hear the scream.


983
0:51:43,184 --> 0:51:46,437
What difference does it make? You people
are talking only about the little details.


984
0:51:46,437 --> 0:51:49,23
You're forgetting the important stuff.
I mean, all of a sudden, everybody here...


985
0:51:49,23 --> 0:51:51,484
- I want to call for another vote.
- I'm talking here!


986
0:51:51,484 --> 0:51:59,33
There's another vote called for.
Now let's take our seats.


987
0:51:59,33 --> 0:52:1,66
I never saw so much time
spent on nothing.


988
0:52:1,66 --> 0:52:4,455
It only takes a second.


989
0:52:4,455 --> 0:52:7,958
Okay. I guess the fastest way
is to find out who's voting not guilty.


990
0:52:7,958 --> 0:52:11,962
Now, all those voting not guilty,
please raise your hands.


991
0:52:11,962 --> 0:52:15,633
Still the same.
One, two, three not guilty. Nine guilty.


992
0:52:15,633 --> 0:52:17,384
So, now where are we?


993
0:52:17,384 --> 0:52:20,888
I'm telling you, we can yackety-yack until
next Tuesday. Where's it all getting us?


994
0:52:20,888 --> 0:52:23,724
Pardon. I vote not guilty.


995
0:52:23,724 --> 0:52:26,811
Oh!


996
0:52:26,811 --> 0:52:30,189
What are ya talking about? I mean,
we're all going crazy in here or something.


997
0:52:30,189 --> 0:52:34,68
The kid is guilty.
Why don't you listen to the facts?


998
0:52:34,68 --> 0:52:36,403
Tell him, will ya?
Now this is getting to be a joke.


999
0:52:36,403 --> 0:52:39,698
The vote is eight to four,
favor of guilty.


1000
0:52:39,698 --> 0:52:43,452
What is this, love your underprivileged
brother week or something?


1001
0:52:43,452 --> 0:52:46,38
I want you to get up and tell me
why you changed your vote.


1002
0:52:46,38 --> 0:52:50,417
- Come on. Give me your reasons.
- I don't have to defend my decision to you.


1003
0:52:50,417 --> 0:52:52,253
There is a reasonable doubt in my mind.


1004
0:52:52,253 --> 0:52:55,339
What reasonable doubt? That's nothing but words.
Here, look at this.


1005
0:52:55,339 --> 0:53:0,344
The kid you just decided isn't guilty
was seen ramming this into his father.


1006
0:53:0,344 --> 0:53:2,429
Now, what about this,
Mr. Reasonable Doubt?


1007
0:53:2,429 --> 0:53:5,182
That's not the knife.
Don't you remember?


1008
0:53:5,182 --> 0:53:7,434
Oh, brilliant.


1009
0:53:7,434 --> 0:53:9,812
I'm telling ya, this is the craziest.


1010
0:53:9,812 --> 0:53:12,64
I mean, what are we supposed to believe?


1011
0:53:12,64 --> 0:53:14,984
I mean, you're sittin' here, you're pulling
stories out of thin air, you know?


1012
0:53:14,984 --> 0:53:18,779
A guy like this, if he's, uh, sitting
ringside at the Dempsey-Firpo fight...


1013
0:53:18,779 --> 0:53:21,323
he'd be trying to tell you that, uh...


1014
0:53:21,323 --> 0:53:23,784
Look. Now, what about the old man?


1015
0:53:23,784 --> 0:53:26,453
Are we supposed to believe that he
didn't get up and run to his door...


1016
0:53:26,453 --> 0:53:29,54
and see the kid tearing down the steps
15 seconds after the killing?


1017
0:53:29,54 --> 0:53:32,84
He's just saying so to be important, right?


1018
0:53:32,84 --> 0:53:34,962
- I mean, what's the point of the whole thing?
- Wait. Hold it a second, will you?


1019
0:53:34,962 --> 0:53:37,256
Oh, and the Baltimore rooter
is heard from again now...


1020
0:53:37,256 --> 0:53:39,3
and pop-ups are fallin' for base hits
wherever we look.


1021
0:53:39,3 --> 0:53:42,636
Hold it a second. Now, look -
Did the old man say he ran to the door?


1022
0:53:42,636 --> 0:53:45,681
Ran, walked. What's the difference? He got on, didn't he?
I mean, he got there, didn't he?


1023
0:53:45,681 --> 0:53:48,309
- No, now wait a second.
- He said he ran. At least I think he did.


1024
0:53:48,309 --> 0:53:51,812
Look, I don't remember what he said, but I
don't see how he could have run to the door.


1025
0:53:51,812 --> 0:53:54,273
Î—e said he went
from his bedroom to the front door.


1026
0:53:54,273 --> 0:53:55,983
- Now, isn't that enough?
- Where was the bedroom?


1027
0:53:55,983 --> 0:53:58,319
- It was down the hall somewhere.
- I thought you remembered everything.


1028
0:53:58,319 --> 0:54:0,654
- Don't you remember that?
- No.


1029
0:54:0,654 --> 0:54:2,99
Mr. Foreman, I'd like to see
a diagram of the apartment.


1030
0:54:2,99 --> 0:54:6,285
- Why don't we just have 'em run the trial all over again
so you can get everything straight? - Mr. Foreman.


1031
0:54:6,285 --> 0:54:8,996
How come you're the only one in this room
wants to see exhibits all the time?


1032
0:54:8,996 --> 0:54:11,79
- I want to see this one too.
- And I'd like to stop wasting time.


1033
0:54:11,79 --> 0:54:14,71
If we're gonna start wading through all that
nonsense about where the body was found...


1034
0:54:14,71 --> 0:54:16,754
We're not,
not unless somebody else wants to.


1035
0:54:16,754 --> 0:54:18,547
But I'd like to find out if an old man...


1036
0:54:18,547 --> 0:54:21,8
who drags one foot when he walks
'cause he had a stroke last year...


1037
0:54:21,8 --> 0:54:23,51
can get from his bedroom
to his front door in 15 seconds.


1038
0:54:23,51 --> 0:54:25,262
- He said 20 seconds.
- Î—e said 15.


1039
0:54:25,262 --> 0:54:27,514
He said 20 seconds.
What are you trying to distort...


1040
0:54:27,514 --> 0:54:30,851
- He said 15.
- How does he know how long 15 seconds is?


1041
0:54:30,851 --> 0:54:32,603
You can't judge a thing like that.


1042
0:54:32,603 --> 0:54:35,64
- He said 15 seconds.
- He was very positive about it.


1043
0:54:35,64 --> 0:54:37,358
He was an old man.
Half the time he was confused.


1044
0:54:37,358 --> 0:54:47,326
How could he be positive about anything?


1045
0:54:47,326 --> 0:54:51,538
I don't see what you're going to prove here.
The man said he saw the boy running out.


1046
0:54:51,538 --> 0:54:53,791
Well, let's see
if the details bear him out.


1047
0:54:53,791 --> 0:54:56,752
As soon as the body hit the floor,
he said he heard footsteps upstairs...


1048
0:54:56,752 --> 0:54:58,504
running toward the front door...


1049
0:54:58,504 --> 0:55:1,674
heard the upstairs door open,
the footsteps start down the stairs.


1050
0:55:1,674 --> 0:55:3,884
He said he got to his own front door
as fast as he could...


1051
0:55:3,884 --> 0:55:6,53
and he swore it couldn't have been
more than 15 seconds.


1052
0:55:6,53 --> 0:55:7,805
Now, if the killer
began running immediately...


1053
0:55:7,805 --> 0:55:10,99
- Maybe he didn't.
- The old man said he did.


1054
0:55:10,99 --> 0:55:14,103
You ought to be at Atlantic City
at that hairsplitters convention.


1055
0:55:14,103 --> 0:55:16,313
Hey, why don't you stop makin'
smart remarks all the time, huh?


1056
0:55:16,313 --> 0:55:19,525
My friend, for your three dollars a day,
you have to listen to everything, you know?


1057
0:55:19,525 --> 0:55:21,318
Now that you've got that thing in here,
what about it?


1058
0:55:21,318 --> 0:55:23,57
All right. Here's the apartment
where the killing took place.


1059
0:55:23,57 --> 0:55:26,699
The old man's apartment
was directly beneath and exactly the same.


1060
0:55:26,699 --> 0:55:29,994
Here are the el tracks, the bedroom,
living room, kitchen, bathroom.


1061
0:55:29,994 --> 0:55:32,79
Here's the hall. Here are the stairs.


1062
0:55:32,79 --> 0:55:34,415
Now, the old man
was in this bedroom right here.


1063
0:55:34,415 --> 0:55:37,167
He says he crossed to the door
and walked down the hall...


1064
0:55:37,167 --> 0:55:40,212
opened the front door just in time
to see the boy running down the stairs.


1065
0:55:40,212 --> 0:55:43,632
- Am I right so far?
- That's the story, for the 19th time.


1066
0:55:43,632 --> 0:55:47,261
- Fifteen seconds after the body hit the floor.
- Correct.


1067
0:55:47,261 --> 0:55:49,388
Now, let's see. It was...


1068
0:55:49,388 --> 0:55:53,475
It's 12 feet from the bed to the door.
The hall is 43 feet.


1069
0:55:53,475 --> 0:55:56,77
He would have had to walk 12 feet,
open the bedroom door...


1070
0:55:56,77 --> 0:56:0,482
walk 43 feet down and open the front door
all in 15 seconds.


1071
0:56:0,482 --> 0:56:3,277
- Do you think he could have done it?
- Sure he could have done it.


1072
0:56:3,277 --> 0:56:5,946
He can walk only very slowly.
They had to help him into the witness chair.


1073
0:56:5,946 --> 0:56:7,698
You make it sound like a long walk.


1074
0:56:7,698 --> 0:56:10,117
For an old man who had a stroke,
it is a long walk.


1075
0:56:10,117 --> 0:56:13,662
- Oh! What are you doing?
- I'm gonna try it, see how long it took him.


1076
0:56:13,662 --> 0:56:17,124
What do you mean, you want to try it?
Why didn't his lawyer bring it up if it's so important?


1077
0:56:17,124 --> 0:56:20,836
- Maybe he just didn't think about it, huh?
- What do you mean, didn't think of it? You think the man's an idiot or something?


1078
0:56:20,836 --> 0:56:22,463
- It's an obvious thing.
- Did you think of it?


1079
0:56:22,463 --> 0:56:24,214
Listen, smart guy.
Don't matter whether I thought of it.


1080
0:56:24,214 --> 0:56:26,55
He didn't bring it up because he knew it would
hurt his case. What do you think of that?


1081
0:56:26,55 --> 0:56:30,471
Maybe he didn't bring it up because it would have
meant bullying and badgering a helpless old man.


1082
0:56:30,471 --> 0:56:33,891
You know that doesn't sit very well with a jury.
Most lawyers avoid it if they can.


1083
0:56:33,891 --> 0:56:36,685
- So, what kind of a bum is he then?
- That's what I've been asking, buddy.


1084
0:56:36,685 --> 0:56:39,813
Pass me that chair, will you?
Those two chairs are the old man's bed.


1085
0:56:39,813 --> 0:56:42,775
I just paced off 12 feet across the room.
This will be the bedroom door.


1086
0:56:42,775 --> 0:56:45,486
Oh, that's crazy.
You can't recreate a thing like that.


1087
0:56:45,486 --> 0:56:47,78
- I'd like to see it.
- The hall was 43 feet.


1088
0:56:47,78 --> 0:56:51,75
I'll pace from that wall and back again.


1089
0:56:51,75 --> 0:56:54,995
Look, this is absolutely insane.
What are you wasting everybody's time in here for?


1090
0:56:54,995 --> 0:57:1,835
According to you, it'll only take 15 seconds.
Now, we can spare that, see.


1091
0:57:1,835 --> 0:57:3,587
Come on. Knock it off.


1092
0:57:3,587 --> 0:57:5,172
Okay.


1093
0:57:5,172 --> 0:57:7,299
Okay. Okay, killer.


1094
0:57:7,299 --> 0:57:11,22
Yeah.


1095
0:57:11,22 --> 0:57:13,347
Will you stand right there
and mark the front door?


1096
0:57:13,347 --> 0:57:15,933
It was chain-locked according
to the testimony, remember?


1097
0:57:15,933 --> 0:57:18,185
- Has anybody got a watch with a second hand?
- I have.


1098
0:57:18,185 --> 0:57:20,687
When you want me to start, stamp your foot.
That'll be the body falling.


1099
0:57:20,687 --> 0:57:22,689
You can time me from there.


1100
0:57:22,689 --> 0:57:24,858
What are we gonna do, play charades now?


1101
0:57:24,858 --> 0:57:26,985
- Come on! What are we waiting for?
- Okay, I'm ready.


1102
0:57:26,985 --> 0:57:28,987
Well, I want to wait
till the second hand reaches 60.


1103
0:57:28,987 --> 0:57:37,621
Oh, come on.


1104
0:57:37,621 --> 0:57:42,84
Come on. Speed it up.
He could walk twice as fast as that.


1105
0:57:42,84 --> 0:58:1,436
You want me to walk faster than that,
I will.


1106
0:58:1,436 --> 0:58:3,981
Lock. Door. Stop.


1107
0:58:3,981 --> 0:58:6,66
- Right.
- What's the time?


1108
0:58:6,66 --> 0:58:9,403
Uh, exactly 41 seconds.


1109
0:58:9,403 --> 0:58:11,738
This is what I think happened.


1110
0:58:11,738 --> 0:58:14,658
The old man heard the fight between the boy
and his father a few hours earlier.


1111
0:58:14,658 --> 0:58:17,578
Then when he's lying in bed, he heard the
body hit the floor in the boy's apartment...


1112
0:58:17,578 --> 0:58:21,165
heard the woman scream from across the street,
got to his front door as fast as he could...


1113
0:58:21,165 --> 0:58:23,834
heard somebody racing down the stairs
and assumed it was the boy.


1114
0:58:23,834 --> 0:58:25,752
- I think that's possible.
- Assumed?


1115
0:58:25,752 --> 0:58:28,338
Oh.


1116
0:58:28,338 --> 0:58:34,386
Brother, I've seen all kinds of dishonesty in
my day, but this little display takes the cake.


1117
0:58:34,386 --> 0:58:39,183
You all come in here with your hearts bleeding all
over the floor about slum kids and injustice.


1118
0:58:39,183 --> 0:58:41,268
You listen to some fairy tales.


1119
0:58:41,268 --> 0:58:43,645
Suddenly you start getting through
to some of these old ladies.


1120
0:58:43,645 --> 0:58:46,69
Well, you're not getting through to me.
I've had enough.


1121
0:58:46,69 --> 0:58:48,817
What's the matter with you guys?


1122
0:58:48,817 --> 0:58:51,612
You all know he's guilty!
He's got to burn!


1123
0:58:51,612 --> 0:58:53,488
You're letting him slip
through our fingers.


1124
0:58:53,488 --> 0:58:55,782
"Slip through our fingers"?
Are you his executioner?


1125
0:58:55,782 --> 0:58:58,619
I'm one of 'em!


1126
0:58:58,619 --> 0:59:0,537
Perhaps you'd like to pull the switch.


1127
0:59:0,537 --> 0:59:2,623
For this kid, you bet I would.


1128
0:59:2,623 --> 0:59:6,752
I feel sorry for you. What it must
feel like to want to pull the switch.


1129
0:59:6,752 --> 0:59:10,756
Ever since you walked into this room, you've been
acting like a self-appointed public avenger.


1130
0:59:10,756 --> 0:59:15,135
You want to see this boy die because you
personally want it, not because of the facts.


1131
0:59:15,135 --> 0:59:17,387
- You're a sadist.
- You...


1132
0:59:17,387 --> 0:59:21,308
Let me go!
I'll kill him. I'll kill him!


1133
0:59:21,308 --> 0:59:31,26
You don't really mean
you'll kill me, do you?


1134
0:59:31,26 --> 0:59:33,445
Is there anything wrong, gentlemen?
I heard some noise.


1135
0:59:33,445 --> 0:59:37,532
Oh, no. Everything's all right. We're just
- You know, friendly little argument. It's...


1136
0:59:37,532 --> 0:59:42,204
Um, listen, we're through with that diagram.
You can take it if you want.


1137
0:59:42,204 --> 0:59:49,419
Here you are. Thank you.


1138
0:59:49,419 --> 1:0:12,276
What are you lookin' at?


1139
1:0:12,276 --> 1:0:14,403
I suppose somebody
has to start it off again.


1140
1:0:14,403 --> 1:0:18,198
- I beg pardon.
- "I beg pardon." What are you so polite about?


1141
1:0:18,198 --> 1:0:20,367
For the same reason you're not.


1142
1:0:20,367 --> 1:0:24,288
It's the way I was brought up.


1143
1:0:24,288 --> 1:0:26,29
This fighting...


1144
1:0:26,29 --> 1:0:28,417
That's not why we are here, to fight.


1145
1:0:28,417 --> 1:0:31,962
We have a responsibility.


1146
1:0:31,962 --> 1:0:36,633
This, I have always thought,
is a remarkable thing about democracy...


1147
1:0:36,633 --> 1:0:39,72
that we are...


1148
1:0:39,72 --> 1:0:42,389
Uh, what is the word?


1149
1:0:42,389 --> 1:0:45,559
Notified.
That we are notified by mail...


1150
1:0:45,559 --> 1:0:49,98
to come down to this place
to decide on the guilt or innocence...


1151
1:0:49,98 --> 1:0:54,109
of a man we have never heard of before.


1152
1:0:54,109 --> 1:0:59,573
We have nothing to gain or lose
by - by our verdict.


1153
1:0:59,573 --> 1:1:3,994
This is one of the reasons
why we are strong.


1154
1:1:3,994 --> 1:1:8,165
We should not make it a personal thing.


1155
1:1:8,165 --> 1:1:11,43
Thank you.


1156
1:1:11,43 --> 1:1:13,42
If nobody else has an idea,
I may have a cutie here.


1157
1:1:13,42 --> 1:1:16,256
I mean, I haven't given it much thought,
but let's throw it out on the stoop...


1158
1:1:16,256 --> 1:1:17,966
and see if the cat licks it up.


1159
1:1:17,966 --> 1:1:24,806
- The cat licks it up?
- Yeah. If the boy...


1160
1:1:24,806 --> 1:1:27,17
Look how dark it's getting out there.


1161
1:1:27,17 --> 1:1:31,271
I'll bet we're gonna have a storm now.


1162
1:1:31,271 --> 1:1:35,233
Boy, oh, boy. It's really hot, huh?


1163
1:1:35,233 --> 1:1:39,446
Pardon me, but don't you ever sweat?


1164
1:1:39,446 --> 1:1:41,698
No, I don't.


1165
1:1:41,698 --> 1:1:43,784
Well, listen. I, uh...


1166
1:1:43,784 --> 1:1:47,37
I was wondering if, uh, maybe...


1167
1:1:47,37 --> 1:1:49,414
maybe we should take another vote.


1168
1:1:49,414 --> 1:1:53,794
Oh, great. Maybe we can follow this one up
with a little dancing and refreshments, huh?


1169
1:1:53,794 --> 1:1:56,38
- Hmm.
- Mr. Foreman?


1170
1:1:56,38 --> 1:2:0,8
Well, that's okay with me.
Anyone doesn't want to vote?


1171
1:2:0,8 --> 1:2:3,303
- Hey, come on. Come on.
- I'm sorry.


1172
1:2:3,303 --> 1:2:6,89
I think we ought to have an open ballot -
call out our votes, you know.


1173
1:2:6,89 --> 1:2:9,184
Let's see who stands where.


1174
1:2:9,184 --> 1:2:14,439
That sounds fair to me.
Anyone object?


1175
1:2:14,439 --> 1:2:18,151
Okay. I'll call off your jury numbers.
One.


1176
1:2:18,151 --> 1:2:21,29
Oh, that's me. I vote guilty.


1177
1:2:21,29 --> 1:2:22,906
Two?


1178
1:2:22,906 --> 1:2:24,95
Not guilty.


1179
1:2:24,95 --> 1:2:28,787
- Number three?
- Guilty.


1180
1:2:28,787 --> 1:2:31,832
Number four?


1181
1:2:31,832 --> 1:2:33,708
Guilty.


1182
1:2:33,708 --> 1:2:37,546
- Number five?
- Not guilty.


1183
1:2:37,546 --> 1:2:41,842
- Number six?
- Not guilty.


1184
1:2:41,842 --> 1:2:43,593
Number seven?


1185
1:2:43,593 --> 1:2:45,387
Guilty.


1186
1:2:45,387 --> 1:2:47,514
Number eight?


1187
1:2:47,514 --> 1:2:50,517
Not guilty.


1188
1:2:50,517 --> 1:2:53,52
- Number nine?
- Not guilty.


1189
1:2:53,52 --> 1:2:57,482
- Number 10?
- Guilty.


1190
1:2:57,482 --> 1:2:59,609
Number 11?


1191
1:2:59,609 --> 1:3:1,528
Not guilty.


1192
1:3:1,528 --> 1:3:3,947
Number 12?


1193
1:3:3,947 --> 1:3:6,366
Number 12.


1194
1:3:6,366 --> 1:3:13,79
Guilty.


1195
1:3:13,79 --> 1:3:15,959
The vote is now six to six.


1196
1:3:15,959 --> 1:3:21,548
Yeah, right.
And we go into extra innings here, huh?


1197
1:3:21,548 --> 1:3:26,136
Six to six. I'm telling you, some of you
people in here must be out of your minds.


1198
1:3:26,136 --> 1:3:28,54
A kid like that.


1199
1:3:28,54 --> 1:3:31,391
I don't think the kind of boy he is
has anything to do with it.


1200
1:3:31,391 --> 1:3:33,56
The facts are supposed
to determine the case.


1201
1:3:33,56 --> 1:3:35,812
Don't give me that!
I'm sick and tired of facts!


1202
1:3:35,812 --> 1:3:37,898
You can twist them any way you like.
You know what I mean?


1203
1:3:37,898 --> 1:3:40,567
That's exactly the point
this gentleman has been making.


1204
1:3:40,567 --> 1:3:45,155
- Oh!
- I mean, you keep shouting at the top of your lungs.


1205
1:3:45,155 --> 1:3:47,157
I'd like to be a few years younger.


1206
1:3:47,157 --> 1:3:52,454
That man gets on my...


1207
1:3:52,454 --> 1:3:55,373
- My, it's hot in here, isn't it?
- Do you want a drink of water?


1208
1:3:55,373 --> 1:4:6,927
No. No, thanks. Thanks.


1209
1:4:6,927 --> 1:4:8,803
It's gonna rain.


1210
1:4:8,803 --> 1:4:12,307
Well, how'd you figure that out, killer?


1211
1:4:12,307 --> 1:4:14,267
How come you changed your vote?


1212
1:4:14,267 --> 1:4:16,77
Well, it just seemed to me
there was room for doubt.


1213
1:4:16,77 --> 1:4:19,64
You haven't got a leg to stand on.
You know that, I hope.


1214
1:4:19,64 --> 1:4:22,15
I don't feel that way.
There were a lot of details that never came out.


1215
1:4:22,15 --> 1:4:25,779
- Yeah. Well, good luck.
- Oh, come on. You're like everybody else.


1216
1:4:25,779 --> 1:4:29,241
You think too much.
You get mixed up.


1217
1:4:29,241 --> 1:4:33,286
- You know what I mean?
- Now, listen. I don't think you have any right...


1218
1:4:33,286 --> 1:5:28,592
Loudmouth.


1219
1:5:28,592 --> 1:5:32,262
Look at that come down, will you?


1220
1:5:32,262 --> 1:5:34,222
You know...


1221
1:5:34,222 --> 1:5:36,808
this reminds me of a storm we had last...


1222
1:5:36,808 --> 1:5:40,353
Oh, when was that? November...


1223
1:5:40,353 --> 1:5:43,523
I don't know. Something.
It was quite a storm we had there.


1224
1:5:43,523 --> 1:5:45,984
It was right in the middle of a game.


1225
1:5:45,984 --> 1:5:48,695
Uh, we were behind 7-6...


1226
1:5:48,695 --> 1:5:51,364
but we just started to move the ball,
right off the tackle.


1227
1:5:51,364 --> 1:5:54,242
Started cutting right -
slash here and slash right in...


1228
1:5:54,242 --> 1:5:56,119
cut right through.


1229
1:5:56,119 --> 1:5:58,705
And, uh...


1230
1:5:58,705 --> 1:6:2,83
We had this kid Slattery, you know?


1231
1:6:2,83 --> 1:6:5,545
A real - He was an ox.
You know, a real ox.


1232
1:6:5,545 --> 1:6:8,131
I wish I had another one just like him.


1233
1:6:8,131 --> 1:6:12,719
I forgot to tell you. I'm the assistant head
coach at the Andrew J. McCorkle High School.


1234
1:6:12,719 --> 1:6:14,888
- Oh, yeah?
- That's out in Queens.


1235
1:6:14,888 --> 1:6:17,724
And, uh, anyway...


1236
1:6:17,724 --> 1:6:19,893
we're starting to move along real nice.


1237
1:6:19,893 --> 1:6:24,356
Their whole line is just -
they're just coming apart.


1238
1:6:24,356 --> 1:6:28,193
And it starts to come down
cats and dogs, just like this.


1239
1:6:28,193 --> 1:6:32,113
Just whoosh - you know, right down.


1240
1:6:32,113 --> 1:6:35,575
Well, that was murder, you know?


1241
1:6:35,575 --> 1:6:38,244
I swear, I - I nearly bawled.


1242
1:6:38,244 --> 1:6:41,831
You just - You couldn't go nowhere.


1243
1:6:41,831 --> 1:6:58,807
Well.


1244
1:6:58,807 --> 1:7:9,67
Hey, what is it with this fan here?
How come...


1245
1:7:9,67 --> 1:7:10,902
Hey! Î—uh?


1246
1:7:10,902 --> 1:7:15,198
Must have been
on the same switch with the lights.


1247
1:7:15,198 --> 1:7:19,35
Well, things are looking up here, huh?


1248
1:7:19,35 --> 1:7:25,375
Yeah, huh?


1249
1:7:25,375 --> 1:7:34,5
Boy. That's better.


1250
1:7:34,5 --> 1:7:35,635
Hey!


1251
1:7:35,635 --> 1:7:41,307
Two points.


1252
1:7:41,307 --> 1:7:45,603
Any of you guys ever go to the Garden?


1253
1:7:45,603 --> 1:7:48,565
That's a damn stupid thing to do.


1254
1:7:48,565 --> 1:7:51,776
Oh, I'm sorry. I, uh...


1255
1:7:51,776 --> 1:7:54,863
You know?


1256
1:7:54,863 --> 1:7:57,449
Pardon me.


1257
1:7:57,449 --> 1:7:59,868
Well, how do you like it?
Even Steven.


1258
1:7:59,868 --> 1:8:2,328
Pretty surprising, isn't it?


1259
1:8:2,328 --> 1:8:5,623
Yes.


1260
1:8:5,623 --> 1:8:9,21
Say, that business before,
when that tall guy - what's-his-name...


1261
1:8:9,21 --> 1:8:12,5
was trying to bait me -
That doesn't prove anything.


1262
1:8:12,5 --> 1:8:14,674
I'm a pretty excitable person.


1263
1:8:14,674 --> 1:8:18,595
I mean, where does he come off calling me
a public avenger, sadist and everything?


1264
1:8:18,595 --> 1:8:22,182
Anyone in his right mind
would blow his stack, huh?


1265
1:8:22,182 --> 1:8:24,559
He was just trying to bait me.


1266
1:8:24,559 --> 1:8:29,355
He did an excellent job.


1267
1:8:29,355 --> 1:8:31,649
I'll tell you what I think.
We're going nowhere here.


1268
1:8:31,649 --> 1:8:34,277
I'm ready to walk into court right now
and declare a hung jury.


1269
1:8:34,277 --> 1:8:36,196
There's no point in this thing
going on any more.


1270
1:8:36,196 --> 1:8:37,614
Yeah. I go for that too.


1271
1:8:37,614 --> 1:8:40,533
Listen, let's take it in to the judge and let
the kid take his chances with 12 other guys.


1272
1:8:40,533 --> 1:8:43,453
I don't think the judge will accept a hung jury.
We haven't been in here very long.


1273
1:8:43,453 --> 1:8:45,205
Well, let's find out.


1274
1:8:45,205 --> 1:8:46,998
I'm not in favor of that.


1275
1:8:46,998 --> 1:8:50,293
Listen. This kid wouldn't stand a chance
with another jury, and you know it.


1276
1:8:50,293 --> 1:8:53,213
Come on! We're hung. Nobody's gonna
change his vote. Let's take it inside.


1277
1:8:53,213 --> 1:8:55,507
You still don't think there's room
for reasonable doubt?


1278
1:8:55,507 --> 1:8:56,883
No, I don't.


1279
1:8:56,883 --> 1:8:58,259
Pardon.


1280
1:8:58,259 --> 1:9:1,596
Maybe you don't fully understand
the term "reasonable doubt."


1281
1:9:1,596 --> 1:9:5,225
What do you mean I don't understand?


1282
1:9:5,225 --> 1:9:7,268
Boy, how do ya like this guy?


1283
1:9:7,268 --> 1:9:9,2
I'm tellin' ya, they're all alike.


1284
1:9:9,2 --> 1:9:11,94
They come over here, running for their life,
and before they can take a deep breath...


1285
1:9:11,94 --> 1:9:14,4
they're telling us how
to run the show, huh?


1286
1:9:14,4 --> 1:9:16,277
Boy, the arrogance of this guy.


1287
1:9:16,277 --> 1:9:20,949
Hey, all right. Let's stop
the arguing for about two minutes in here.


1288
1:9:20,949 --> 1:9:23,409
Now, who's got something
constructive to say?


1289
1:9:23,409 --> 1:9:27,38
I'd like to go over something,
if you gentlemen don't mind.


1290
1:9:27,38 --> 1:9:29,791
An important point for the prosecution
was the fact...


1291
1:9:29,791 --> 1:9:32,627
that after the boy claimed
he'd been at the movies...


1292
1:9:32,627 --> 1:9:34,712
during the hours
that the killing took place...


1293
1:9:34,712 --> 1:9:38,675
couldn't remember the names of the movies
or the stars who appeared in them.


1294
1:9:38,675 --> 1:9:41,261
This gentleman here has put up that point
in here several times.


1295
1:9:41,261 --> 1:9:42,804
That's correct.


1296
1:9:42,804 --> 1:9:44,764
It was the only alibi the boy offered...


1297
1:9:44,764 --> 1:9:47,35
and he himself couldn't back it up
with any details at all.


1298
1:9:47,35 --> 1:9:50,687
Putting yourself in the boy's place,
do you think you could remember details...


1299
1:9:50,687 --> 1:9:54,232
after an upsetting experience such as
being slapped in the face by your father?


1300
1:9:54,232 --> 1:9:57,527
I think so, if there were
any special details to remember.


1301
1:9:57,527 --> 1:10:0,78
The boy couldn't remember the names of the movies
he saw because be wasn't there that night.


1302
1:10:0,78 --> 1:10:2,907
According to
the police testimony in court...


1303
1:10:2,907 --> 1:10:6,119
the boy was questioned by the detectives
in the kitchen of his apartment...


1304
1:10:6,119 --> 1:10:9,122
while the body of his father
was lying on the floor in the bedroom.


1305
1:10:9,122 --> 1:10:11,791
Do you think you could remember details
under those circumstances?


1306
1:10:11,791 --> 1:10:13,877
- I do.
- Under great emotional stress?


1307
1:10:13,877 --> 1:10:16,462
- Under great emotional stress.
- He remembered them correctly in court.


1308
1:10:16,462 --> 1:10:18,506
He named the pictures
and the stars who played in them.


1309
1:10:18,506 --> 1:10:21,759
Yes. His lawyer took great pains
to bring that out.


1310
1:10:21,759 --> 1:10:24,387
He had three months from the night
of the murder to the day of the trial...


1311
1:10:24,387 --> 1:10:26,97
in which to memorize them.


1312
1:10:26,97 --> 1:10:28,85
It's not difficult for a lawyer to find out
what played at a particular theater...


1313
1:10:28,85 --> 1:10:30,602
on a particular night.


1314
1:10:30,602 --> 1:10:34,314
I'll take the testimony of the policemen who
interrogated the boy right after the murder...


1315
1:10:34,314 --> 1:10:36,816
when he couldn't remember
a thing about the movies...


1316
1:10:36,816 --> 1:10:38,818
great emotional stress or not.


1317
1:10:38,818 --> 1:10:42,196
- I'd like to ask you a personal question.
- Go ahead.


1318
1:10:42,196 --> 1:10:45,533
- Where were you last night?
- I was home.


1319
1:10:45,533 --> 1:10:48,161
- How about the night before that?
- Come on! What is this?


1320
1:10:48,161 --> 1:10:49,579
No, it's all right.


1321
1:10:49,579 --> 1:10:52,206
I left the office at 8:30
and went straight home and to bed.


1322
1:10:52,206 --> 1:10:53,958
And the night before that?


1323
1:10:53,958 --> 1:10:56,461
That was, uh, Tuesday night?


1324
1:10:56,461 --> 1:10:58,546
The night of the bridge tournament.
I played bridge.


1325
1:10:58,546 --> 1:10:59,964
Monday night?


1326
1:10:59,964 --> 1:11:5,178
When you get down
to New Year's Eve, 1954, let me know, huh?


1327
1:11:5,178 --> 1:11:8,389
Monday night?


1328
1:11:8,389 --> 1:11:11,476
Monday night, uh,
my wife and I went to the movies.


1329
1:11:11,476 --> 1:11:13,186
- What did you see?
- The Scarlet Circle.


1330
1:11:13,186 --> 1:11:16,522
- It was a clever whodunit.
- What was the second feature?


1331
1:11:16,522 --> 1:11:19,233
The, um...


1332
1:11:19,233 --> 1:11:21,986
I'll tell you in a minute. The, uh...


1333
1:11:21,986 --> 1:11:26,24
Remarkable Mrs., uh, something...


1334
1:11:26,24 --> 1:11:28,785
The...


1335
1:11:28,785 --> 1:11:31,537
Mrs. Bainbridge.
The Remarkable Mrs. Bainbridge.


1336
1:11:31,537 --> 1:11:35,583
I saw that.
It's called The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.


1337
1:11:35,583 --> 1:11:38,44
Uh, yes. The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.
I think that's right.


1338
1:11:38,44 --> 1:11:40,63
Who was in The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge?


1339
1:11:40,63 --> 1:11:44,384
Barbara... Long, I think it was.


1340
1:11:44,384 --> 1:11:47,72
A dark, very pretty girl.


1341
1:11:47,72 --> 1:11:50,306
Ling or Long - something like that.


1342
1:11:50,306 --> 1:11:53,601
- Who else?
- I'd never heard of them before.


1343
1:11:53,601 --> 1:11:58,106
It was a very inexpensive second feature
with, uh, unknown...


1344
1:11:58,106 --> 1:12:4,153
And you weren't under
an emotional stress, were you?


1345
1:12:4,153 --> 1:12:6,364
No.


1346
1:12:6,364 --> 1:12:9,909
I wasn't.


1347
1:12:9,909 --> 1:12:11,744
I think the point is made.


1348
1:12:11,744 --> 1:12:14,58
Big point!


1349
1:12:14,58 --> 1:12:16,833
You can talk till your tongue
is draggin' on the floor.


1350
1:12:16,833 --> 1:12:21,4
The boy is guilty, period.
You know what I mean, my friend?


1351
1:12:21,4 --> 1:12:26,259
- Who's got those cough drops?
- They're all gone, my friend.


1352
1:12:26,259 --> 1:12:28,594
Oh, boy. Look at that rain.


1353
1:12:28,594 --> 1:12:31,55
There goes your ball game.


1354
1:12:31,55 --> 1:12:33,558
It's only a shower.


1355
1:12:33,558 --> 1:12:35,81
Besides, they got the infield covered.


1356
1:12:35,81 --> 1:12:41,774
Right. Say, could I see that knife
a second, please?


1357
1:12:41,774 --> 1:12:44,193
Well, we're still tied up six to six.


1358
1:12:44,193 --> 1:12:46,279
Who's got a suggestion?


1359
1:12:46,279 --> 1:12:48,364
It's five after 6:00.
Let's get some dinner.


1360
1:12:48,364 --> 1:12:50,908
Why don't we wait till 7:00,
give it another hour, huh?


1361
1:12:50,908 --> 1:12:53,119
Okay with me.


1362
1:12:53,119 --> 1:12:55,371
Uh, there's something I'd like to say.


1363
1:12:55,371 --> 1:12:59,0
I mean, it's been bothering me a little,
and as long as we're stuck.


1364
1:12:59,0 --> 1:13:2,962
Well, there was this whole business
about the stab wound and how it was made...


1365
1:13:2,962 --> 1:13:4,672
the downward angle of it, you know?


1366
1:13:4,672 --> 1:13:6,758
Don't tell me we're gonna
start with that again.


1367
1:13:6,758 --> 1:13:8,468
They've been over it and over it.


1368
1:13:8,468 --> 1:13:10,845
Well, I know they did,
but I don't go along with it.


1369
1:13:10,845 --> 1:13:14,932
Now, the boy was 5 feet 7 inches tall.
His father was 6'2...


1370
1:13:14,932 --> 1:13:17,185
That's a difference of seven inches.


1371
1:13:17,185 --> 1:13:19,937
It's a very awkward thing to stab down
into the chest of someone...


1372
1:13:19,937 --> 1:13:22,23
who's more than half a foot
taller than you are.


1373
1:13:22,23 --> 1:13:24,233
Give me that.


1374
1:13:24,233 --> 1:13:28,404
I'll give you a demonstration.
Somebody get up.


1375
1:13:28,404 --> 1:13:34,827
You...


1376
1:13:34,827 --> 1:13:37,622
I want you to watch this 'cause
I don't want to have to do it again.


1377
1:13:37,622 --> 1:13:40,458
I'll make myself about six
or seven inches shorter, okay?


1378
1:13:40,458 --> 1:13:51,385
- It's about right. Maybe a little more.
- Okay. A little more.


1379
1:13:51,385 --> 1:13:55,89
That's not funny.


1380
1:13:55,89 --> 1:14:0,394
Now, nobody's hurt. Right?


1381
1:14:0,394 --> 1:14:5,65
Right. Nobody hurt.


1382
1:14:5,65 --> 1:14:10,53
Now, this is the way I'd stab a man
who was taller than I was.


1383
1:14:10,53 --> 1:14:13,74
Look at the angle - down and in.


1384
1:14:13,74 --> 1:14:15,243
And this is the way it was done.


1385
1:14:15,243 --> 1:14:19,622
Now tell me I'm wrong.


1386
1:14:19,622 --> 1:14:23,126
- Down and in. I guess there's no argument.
- Hold it a minute, will ya?


1387
1:14:23,126 --> 1:14:25,962
Can you give me that?


1388
1:14:25,962 --> 1:14:27,964
Boy, I hate these things.


1389
1:14:27,964 --> 1:14:29,715
- Did you ever see a knife fight?
- No.


1390
1:14:29,715 --> 1:14:31,384
- You?
- No.


1391
1:14:31,384 --> 1:14:34,262
Anybody here ever see a knife fight?


1392
1:14:34,262 --> 1:14:37,14
Well, I have.
You know, on my back stoop...


1393
1:14:37,14 --> 1:14:39,559
the lot across the street, backyard.


1394
1:14:39,559 --> 1:14:42,61
Switchblades came
with the neighborhood where I lived.


1395
1:14:42,61 --> 1:14:45,398
It's funny I never thought of it before.
I guess you try to forget those things.


1396
1:14:45,398 --> 1:14:50,528
- How do you use a switchblade?
- Well, you'd never use it like this.


1397
1:14:50,528 --> 1:14:54,574
See, you use too much time
switching hands.


1398
1:14:54,574 --> 1:14:59,787
Here's how - underhanded.


1399
1:14:59,787 --> 1:15:2,915
Anyone who's ever used a switch knife
wouldn't handle it any other way.


1400
1:15:2,915 --> 1:15:5,626
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.


1401
1:15:5,626 --> 1:15:7,545
That's why they're made to open like that.


1402
1:15:7,545 --> 1:15:10,256
- You'd say the boy was pretty handy with a knife?
- Mm-hmm.


1403
1:15:10,256 --> 1:15:13,509
You think he could have made
the kind of wound that killed his father?


1404
1:15:13,509 --> 1:15:17,513
No. Not with the experience he'd had
all his life handling these things.


1405
1:15:17,513 --> 1:15:19,599
I feel he'd have gone for him underhanded.


1406
1:15:19,599 --> 1:15:22,727
How do you know? Were you
in the room when the father was killed?


1407
1:15:22,727 --> 1:15:24,812
No. Neither was anybody else.


1408
1:15:24,812 --> 1:15:28,107
So what are you giving us all this
mumbo jumbo for? I don't believe it.


1409
1:15:28,107 --> 1:15:31,444
I don't think you can determine what type of
wound the boy might or might not have made...


1410
1:15:31,444 --> 1:15:34,155
simply because he knew
how to handle a knife.


1411
1:15:34,155 --> 1:15:36,574
What do you think?


1412
1:15:36,574 --> 1:15:38,743
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?


1413
1:15:38,743 --> 1:15:44,79
I don't know.


1414
1:15:44,79 --> 1:15:46,876
How about you?


1415
1:15:46,876 --> 1:15:50,713
I don't know about the rest of them, but I'm getting a
little tired of this yackety-yackin' back and forth.


1416
1:15:50,713 --> 1:15:54,258
It's gettin' us nowhere.
So I guess I'll have to break it up.


1417
1:15:54,258 --> 1:15:56,886
I change my vote to not guilty.


1418
1:15:56,886 --> 1:16:0,306
- You what?
- You heard me. I've had enough.


1419
1:16:0,306 --> 1:16:2,85
What do you mean you've had enough?
That's no answer!


1420
1:16:2,85 --> 1:16:6,896
Hey, listen. You just take care
of yourself, huh? You know?


1421
1:16:6,896 --> 1:16:10,942
He's right. That's not an answer.


1422
1:16:10,942 --> 1:16:13,986
What kind of a man are you?


1423
1:16:13,986 --> 1:16:17,198
You have sat here and voted guilty
with everyone else...


1424
1:16:17,198 --> 1:16:21,535
because there are some baseball tickets
burning a hole in your pocket.


1425
1:16:21,535 --> 1:16:26,791
And now you've changed your vote because you
say you're sick of all the talking here?


1426
1:16:26,791 --> 1:16:28,334
Now listen, buddy!


1427
1:16:28,334 --> 1:16:33,89
Who tells you that you have the right
to play like this with a man's life?


1428
1:16:33,89 --> 1:16:35,675
- Don't you care -
- Now wait a minute!


1429
1:16:35,675 --> 1:16:39,762
- You can't talk like that to me!
- I can talk like that to you.


1430
1:16:39,762 --> 1:16:41,722
If you want to vote not guilty...


1431
1:16:41,722 --> 1:16:44,183
then do it because you are convinced
the man is not guilty...


1432
1:16:44,183 --> 1:16:46,6
not because you've had enough.


1433
1:16:46,6 --> 1:16:48,729
And if you think he is guilty,
then vote that way.


1434
1:16:48,729 --> 1:16:52,24
Or don't you have the guts
to do what you think is right?


1435
1:16:52,24 --> 1:16:55,69
- Now listen.
- Guilty or not guilty?


1436
1:16:55,69 --> 1:17:0,324
- I told you, not guilty.
- Why?


1437
1:17:0,324 --> 1:17:2,34
Look, I don't have to...


1438
1:17:2,34 --> 1:17:5,246
You do have to! Say it! Why?


1439
1:17:5,246 --> 1:17:17,216
All right. I don't, uh, think he's guilty.


1440
1:17:17,216 --> 1:17:18,926
I want another vote.


1441
1:17:18,926 --> 1:17:21,512
Okay. There's another vote called for.


1442
1:17:21,512 --> 1:17:24,473
I guess the quickest way is a show of hands.
Anyone object?


1443
1:17:24,473 --> 1:17:28,311
Okay. All those voting not guilty,
raise your hands.


1444
1:17:28,311 --> 1:17:36,319
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...


1445
1:17:36,319 --> 1:17:41,907
eight.


1446
1:17:41,907 --> 1:17:45,36
Um, nine.


1447
1:17:45,36 --> 1:17:50,124
Um, all those voting guilty,
raise your hands.


1448
1:17:50,124 --> 1:17:52,585
One, two, three.


1449
1:17:52,585 --> 1:17:56,88
Well, the vote's nine to three
in favor of acquittal.


1450
1:17:56,88 --> 1:17:58,341
I don't understand you people!


1451
1:17:58,341 --> 1:18:0,593
I mean, all these picky little points
you keep bringing up.


1452
1:18:0,593 --> 1:18:4,13
They don't mean nothing!
You saw this kid just like I did.


1453
1:18:4,13 --> 1:18:7,6
You're not gonna tell me you believe
that phony story about losing the knife...


1454
1:18:7,6 --> 1:18:9,685
and that business
about being at the movies.


1455
1:18:9,685 --> 1:18:12,772
Look, you know how these people lie.
It's born in them.


1456
1:18:12,772 --> 1:18:14,899
I mean, what the heck.
I don't have to tell you.


1457
1:18:14,899 --> 1:18:16,942
They don't know what the truth is.


1458
1:18:16,942 --> 1:18:20,738
And let me tell you, they don't need
any real big reason to kill someone either.


1459
1:18:20,738 --> 1:18:22,573
No, sir.


1460
1:18:22,573 --> 1:18:25,701
They get drunk!
Oh, they're real big drinkers, all of 'em.


1461
1:18:25,701 --> 1:18:28,954
You know that.
And bang - someone's lying in the gutter.


1462
1:18:28,954 --> 1:18:32,41
Well, nobody's blaming them for it.
That's the way they are, by nature.


1463
1:18:32,41 --> 1:18:34,21
You know what I mean? Violent!


1464
1:18:34,21 --> 1:18:35,795
Where are you going?


1465
1:18:35,795 --> 1:18:39,799
Î—uman life don't mean
as much to them as it does to us.


1466
1:18:39,799 --> 1:18:42,885
Look! They're lushing it up
and fighting all the time...


1467
1:18:42,885 --> 1:18:44,97
and if somebody gets killed,
so somebody gets killed!


1468
1:18:44,97 --> 1:18:46,43
They don't care!


1469
1:18:46,43 --> 1:18:48,724
Oh, sure, there's some good things
about 'em too.


1470
1:18:48,724 --> 1:18:50,768
Look, I'm the first one to say that.


1471
1:18:50,768 --> 1:18:54,146
I've known a couple who were okay, but
that's the exception, you know what I mean?


1472
1:18:54,146 --> 1:18:57,983
Most of 'em, it's like they have no feelings.
They can do anything.


1473
1:18:57,983 --> 1:19:0,653
What's going on here?


1474
1:19:0,653 --> 1:19:2,78
I'm - I'm trying to tell ya...


1475
1:19:2,78 --> 1:19:4,865
you're making a big mistake, you people.


1476
1:19:4,865 --> 1:19:9,578
This kid is a liar!
I know it. I know all about them.


1477
1:19:9,578 --> 1:19:11,831
Listen to me.
They're no good.


1478
1:19:11,831 --> 1:19:16,21
There's not a one of 'em who's any good.


1479
1:19:16,21 --> 1:19:18,754
I mean, what -
What's happening in here?


1480
1:19:18,754 --> 1:19:22,216
I'm speaking my piece, and you...


1481
1:19:22,216 --> 1:19:24,969
Listen to me.


1482
1:19:24,969 --> 1:19:26,512
I...


1483
1:19:26,512 --> 1:19:29,56
We're - This kid on trial here, his type...


1484
1:19:29,56 --> 1:19:33,18
Well, don't you know about them?


1485
1:19:33,18 --> 1:19:36,564
Th-There's - There's a danger here.


1486
1:19:36,564 --> 1:19:38,732
These people are dangerous.


1487
1:19:38,732 --> 1:19:41,861
They're... wild.


1488
1:19:41,861 --> 1:19:43,863
Listen to me.


1489
1:19:43,863 --> 1:19:46,282
- Listen.
- I have.


1490
1:19:46,282 --> 1:19:53,205
Now sit down
and don't open your mouth again.


1491
1:19:53,205 --> 1:20:32,453
I was only trying to... tell you.


1492
1:20:32,453 --> 1:20:37,875
It's always difficult to keep personal
prejudice out of a thing like this.


1493
1:20:37,875 --> 1:20:43,464
Wherever you run into it,
prejudice always obscures the truth.


1494
1:20:43,464 --> 1:20:45,925
I don't really know what the truth is.


1495
1:20:45,925 --> 1:20:50,137
I don't suppose anybody
will ever really know.


1496
1:20:50,137 --> 1:20:54,183
Nine of us now seem to feel
that the defendant is innocent.


1497
1:20:54,183 --> 1:20:57,269
But we're just gambling on probabilities.


1498
1:20:57,269 --> 1:20:59,313
We may be wrong.


1499
1:20:59,313 --> 1:21:1,774
We may be trying to let
a guilty man go free.


1500
1:21:1,774 --> 1:21:3,317
I don't know.


1501
1:21:3,317 --> 1:21:5,402
Nobody really can.


1502
1:21:5,402 --> 1:21:7,863
But we have a reasonable doubt...


1503
1:21:7,863 --> 1:21:11,45
and that's something
that's very valuable in our system.


1504
1:21:11,45 --> 1:21:17,456
No jury can declare a man guilty
unless it's sure.


1505
1:21:17,456 --> 1:21:19,917
We nine can't understand...


1506
1:21:19,917 --> 1:21:23,462
how you three are still so sure.


1507
1:21:23,462 --> 1:21:26,84
- Maybe you can tell us.
- I'll try.


1508
1:21:26,84 --> 1:21:30,427
You've made some excellent points, but I
still believe the boy is guilty of murder...


1509
1:21:30,427 --> 1:21:32,221
and I have two reasons.


1510
1:21:32,221 --> 1:21:35,432
One, the evidence
given by the woman across the street...


1511
1:21:35,432 --> 1:21:38,143
who actually saw the murder committed.


1512
1:21:38,143 --> 1:21:40,813
As far as I'm concerned,
that's the most important testimony.


1513
1:21:40,813 --> 1:21:44,149
And two, the fact that she
described the stabbing by saying...


1514
1:21:44,149 --> 1:21:49,863
she saw the boy raise his arm over his head
and stab down into the father's chest.


1515
1:21:49,863 --> 1:21:51,991
She saw him do it the wrong way.


1516
1:21:51,991 --> 1:21:53,993
That's absolutely right.


1517
1:21:53,993 --> 1:21:56,662
Let's talk about this woman for a moment.


1518
1:21:56,662 --> 1:21:59,832
She said she went to bed
about 11:00 that night.


1519
1:21:59,832 --> 1:22:3,502
Her bed was next to the window,
and she could look out while lying down...


1520
1:22:3,502 --> 1:22:7,673
and see directly into the boy's room
across the street.


1521
1:22:7,673 --> 1:22:10,384
She tossed and turned for over an hour,
unable to sleep.


1522
1:22:10,384 --> 1:22:14,638
Finally, she turned toward the window
at about 10 minutes after 12:00...


1523
1:22:14,638 --> 1:22:19,852
and, as she looked out, she saw the killing
through the windows of a passing el train.


1524
1:22:19,852 --> 1:22:22,646
She said the lights went out
immediately after the killing...


1525
1:22:22,646 --> 1:22:28,444
but that she got a good look at the boy
in the act of stabbing his father.


1526
1:22:28,444 --> 1:22:33,32
As far as I can see it,
this is unshakable testimony.


1527
1:22:33,32 --> 1:22:41,81
- Well, that's the whole case.
- What do you think?


1528
1:22:41,81 --> 1:22:44,376
How about you?


1529
1:22:44,376 --> 1:22:46,92
I-I don't know.


1530
1:22:46,92 --> 1:22:49,6
So much evidence to sift.


1531
1:22:49,6 --> 1:22:51,5
This is a pretty complicated business.


1532
1:22:51,5 --> 1:22:54,928
Frankly, I don't see
how you can vote for acquittal.


1533
1:22:54,928 --> 1:22:57,348
It's not so easy to arrange
all the evidence in order.


1534
1:22:57,348 --> 1:22:59,475
You can throw out
all the other evidence!


1535
1:22:59,475 --> 1:23:3,145
The woman saw him do it!
What else do you want?


1536
1:23:3,145 --> 1:23:5,105
- Yeah, well, maybe -
- Let's vote on it.


1537
1:23:5,105 --> 1:23:7,358
Okay. There's another vote called for.


1538
1:23:7,358 --> 1:23:9,276
Anybody object?


1539
1:23:9,276 --> 1:23:12,404
All right. I'm changing my vote.
He's guilty.


1540
1:23:12,404 --> 1:23:14,907
Anybody else?
The vote is eight to four.


1541
1:23:14,907 --> 1:23:18,577
Why is this such a personal triumph
for you - this one vote?


1542
1:23:18,577 --> 1:23:22,122
Okay. I say we're a hung jury.
I say we take it in to the judge.


1543
1:23:22,122 --> 1:23:24,917
Î—ow about it?
I want to hear arguments.


1544
1:23:24,917 --> 1:23:29,672
You, you're the leader of the cause.
What about it?


1545
1:23:29,672 --> 1:23:31,59
Let's go over it again.


1546
1:23:31,59 --> 1:23:33,592
We've been over it again!


1547
1:23:33,592 --> 1:23:38,472
The boy in the gray flannel suit here is bouncin'
backwards and forwards like a tennis ball.


1548
1:23:38,472 --> 1:23:44,269
No point in getting nasty
and trying to turn this into a contest.


1549
1:23:44,269 --> 1:23:45,813
Okay.


1550
1:23:45,813 --> 1:23:48,941
Maybe we can talk about
setting some kind of time limit.


1551
1:23:48,941 --> 1:23:51,777
Yeah, once around for the deal, huh?


1552
1:23:51,777 --> 1:23:55,614
It's a quarter after 6:00.


1553
1:23:55,614 --> 1:23:57,658
Someone before mentioned 7:00.


1554
1:23:57,658 --> 1:24:0,119
I think that's a point at which
we might begin to discuss...


1555
1:24:0,119 --> 1:24:3,455
the question of whether
we're a hung jury or not.


1556
1:24:3,455 --> 1:24:6,458
Don't you feel well?


1557
1:24:6,458 --> 1:24:8,502
I feel perfectly well, thank you.


1558
1:24:8,502 --> 1:24:11,296
I was saying that 7:00
would be a reasonable time.


1559
1:24:11,296 --> 1:24:14,299
Uh, the reason I asked about that
was because, uh...


1560
1:24:14,299 --> 1:24:15,968
you were rubbing your nose like...


1561
1:24:15,968 --> 1:24:18,721
Oh, I'm sorry for interrupting...


1562
1:24:18,721 --> 1:24:22,15
but you made a gesture
that reminded me of something.


1563
1:24:22,15 --> 1:24:24,143
I'm trying to settle something here.
Do you mind?


1564
1:24:24,143 --> 1:24:27,229
Well, I think this is important.


1565
1:24:27,229 --> 1:24:29,106
Thank you.


1566
1:24:29,106 --> 1:24:31,817
Now then,
I'm sure you'll pardon me for this...


1567
1:24:31,817 --> 1:24:34,82
but I was wondering why
you were rubbing your nose like that.


1568
1:24:34,82 --> 1:24:36,572
Oh, come on, will ya?


1569
1:24:36,572 --> 1:24:40,826
At this point, I happen to be talking
to the gentleman sitting next to you!


1570
1:24:40,826 --> 1:24:44,163
Now, why were you rubbing
your nose like that?


1571
1:24:44,163 --> 1:24:48,333
Well, if it's any of your business, I was
rubbing it because it bothers me a little.


1572
1:24:48,333 --> 1:24:50,43
Oh. I'm sorry.


1573
1:24:50,43 --> 1:24:54,6
- Is it - Is it because of your eyeglasses?
- It is.


1574
1:24:54,6 --> 1:24:55,841
Now can we get on to something else?


1575
1:24:55,841 --> 1:25:0,512
Your eyeglasses made those two
deep impressions on the sides of your nose.


1576
1:25:0,512 --> 1:25:2,765
I hadn't noticed that before.


1577
1:25:2,765 --> 1:25:6,351
- That must be annoying.
- It is very annoying.


1578
1:25:6,351 --> 1:25:8,353
Well, I wouldn't know about that.


1579
1:25:8,353 --> 1:25:11,774
I've never worn eyeglasses.
Twenty-twenty.


1580
1:25:11,774 --> 1:25:16,236
Listen, will you come on already
with the optometrist bit?


1581
1:25:16,236 --> 1:25:19,865
The woman who testified
that she saw the killing...


1582
1:25:19,865 --> 1:25:24,411
had those same marks
on the sides of her nose.


1583
1:25:24,411 --> 1:25:26,705
Holy smokes! You know, he's right.


1584
1:25:26,705 --> 1:25:28,457
Please.


1585
1:25:28,457 --> 1:25:32,294
Just give me a minute,
and I'll be finished.


1586
1:25:32,294 --> 1:25:35,214
I don't know if anyone else
noticed that about her.


1587
1:25:35,214 --> 1:25:40,135
I didn't think of it then,
but I've been going over her face...


1588
1:25:40,135 --> 1:25:42,346
in my mind.


1589
1:25:42,346 --> 1:25:45,349
She had those same marks.


1590
1:25:45,349 --> 1:25:50,562
- She kept rubbing them in court.
- He's right. She did do that a lot.


1591
1:25:50,562 --> 1:25:55,317
This woman was about, uh -
about 45 years old.


1592
1:25:55,317 --> 1:25:59,363
She was making a tremendous effort
to look 35...


1593
1:25:59,363 --> 1:26:1,657
for her first public appearance.


1594
1:26:1,657 --> 1:26:4,993
Heavy makeup, dyed hair...


1595
1:26:4,993 --> 1:26:8,956
brand-new clothes that should have
been worn by a younger woman.


1596
1:26:8,956 --> 1:26:10,707
No glasses.


1597
1:26:10,707 --> 1:26:12,459
No, women do that.


1598
1:26:12,459 --> 1:26:14,962
See if you can get the
mental picture of it.


1599
1:26:14,962 --> 1:26:16,88
What do you mean, no glasses?


1600
1:26:16,88 --> 1:26:19,675
How do you know whether she wore glasses?
Just 'cause she was rubbing her nose?


1601
1:26:19,675 --> 1:26:21,969
Now, she had those marks. I saw 'em.


1602
1:26:21,969 --> 1:26:23,971
So what?
What do ya think that means?


1603
1:26:23,971 --> 1:26:27,266
- Listen, I'm getting so sick of your yelling in here!
- Come on. Forget it.


1604
1:26:27,266 --> 1:26:30,352
Hey, listen. Listen, he's right.
I saw them too.


1605
1:26:30,352 --> 1:26:33,564
I was the closest one to her. She had these,
uh - these things on the side of her nose.


1606
1:26:33,564 --> 1:26:36,859
- What do you call those on the side?
- Well, what point are you making here?


1607
1:26:36,859 --> 1:26:40,821
She had dyed hair, marks on her nose.
Well, what does that mean?


1608
1:26:40,821 --> 1:26:48,704
Could those marks be made
by anything other than eyeglasses?


1609
1:26:48,704 --> 1:26:51,123
No, they couldn't.


1610
1:26:51,123 --> 1:26:54,751
I didn't see any marks!


1611
1:26:54,751 --> 1:26:56,545
I did.


1612
1:26:56,545 --> 1:26:59,172
Strange, but I didn't
think about it before.


1613
1:26:59,172 --> 1:27:1,383
Well, what about the lawyer?
Why didn't he say something?


1614
1:27:1,383 --> 1:27:4,386
There are 12 people in here
concentrating on this case.


1615
1:27:4,386 --> 1:27:6,555
Eleven of us didn't think of it either.


1616
1:27:6,555 --> 1:27:9,808
Well, what about the district attorney?
Do you think he'd pull a trick like that?


1617
1:27:9,808 --> 1:27:11,81
Have her testify without her glasses?


1618
1:27:11,81 --> 1:27:15,814
Did you ever see a woman who had to wear glasses and
didn't want to because she thinks they spoil her looks?


1619
1:27:15,814 --> 1:27:19,401
Okay. She had marks on her nose.


1620
1:27:19,401 --> 1:27:23,155
I'm giving you that.
From glasses, right?


1621
1:27:23,155 --> 1:27:27,409
She didn't want to wear 'em out of the house
so people would think she's gorgeous.


1622
1:27:27,409 --> 1:27:32,8
But when she saw this kid killing his
father, she was in the house alone.


1623
1:27:32,8 --> 1:27:34,374
That's all.


1624
1:27:34,374 --> 1:27:40,88
- Do you wear glasses when you go to bed?
- No, I don't.


1625
1:27:40,88 --> 1:27:42,9
No one wears eyeglasses to bed.


1626
1:27:42,9 --> 1:27:45,177
It's logical to assume that she wasn't
wearing them when she was in bed...


1627
1:27:45,177 --> 1:27:47,12
tossing and turning, trying to fall asleep.


1628
1:27:47,12 --> 1:27:49,431
- How do you know?
- I don't know! I'm guessing.


1629
1:27:49,431 --> 1:27:51,975
I'm also guessing that she probably
didn't put her glasses on...


1630
1:27:51,975 --> 1:27:54,186
when she turned
to look casually out of the window.


1631
1:27:54,186 --> 1:27:57,22
And she herself testified the killing
took place just as she looked out.


1632
1:27:57,22 --> 1:28:0,15
The lights went off a split second later.
She couldn't have had time to put them on then.


1633
1:28:0,15 --> 1:28:1,86
- Wait a second.
- Here's another guess.


1634
1:28:1,86 --> 1:28:6,31
Maybe she honestly thought she saw the boy
kill his father. I say she only saw a blur.


1635
1:28:6,31 --> 1:28:9,701
How do you know what she saw?
How does he know all that?


1636
1:28:9,701 --> 1:28:12,537
How do you know what kind of glasses she wore?
Maybe they were sunglasses.


1637
1:28:12,537 --> 1:28:15,248
Maybe she was farsighted.
What do you know about it?


1638
1:28:15,248 --> 1:28:18,585
I only know the woman's eyesight
is in question now.


1639
1:28:18,585 --> 1:28:24,8
She had to be able to identify a person
60 feet away, at night, without glasses.


1640
1:28:24,8 --> 1:28:27,26
You can't send someone off to die
on evidence like that.


1641
1:28:27,26 --> 1:28:29,346
Oh, don't give me that.


1642
1:28:29,346 --> 1:28:31,598
Don't you think the woman
might have made a mistake?


1643
1:28:31,598 --> 1:28:34,101
- No.
- It's not possible?


1644
1:28:34,101 --> 1:28:38,689
No, it's not possible.


1645
1:28:38,689 --> 1:28:41,733
Is it possible?


1646
1:28:41,733 --> 1:28:47,572
Not guilty.


1647
1:28:47,572 --> 1:28:50,325
Do you think he's guilty?


1648
1:28:50,325 --> 1:28:55,8
I think he's guilty.


1649
1:28:55,8 --> 1:28:59,626
Do you?


1650
1:28:59,626 --> 1:29:2,754
No. I'm convinced.


1651
1:29:2,754 --> 1:29:4,423
Not guilty.


1652
1:29:4,423 --> 1:29:6,299
What's the matter with you?


1653
1:29:6,299 --> 1:29:8,301
I have a reasonable doubt now.


1654
1:29:8,301 --> 1:29:9,928
Eleven to one.


1655
1:29:9,928 --> 1:29:12,931
Well, what about all the other evidence?
What about all that stuff?


1656
1:29:12,931 --> 1:29:15,1
The knife, the whole business!


1657
1:29:15,1 --> 1:29:23,775
Well, you said we could throw out
all the other evidence.


1658
1:29:23,775 --> 1:29:28,947
Well, what do we do now?


1659
1:29:28,947 --> 1:29:30,699
You're alone.


1660
1:29:30,699 --> 1:29:37,706
I don't care whether I'm alone or not!
It's my right.


1661
1:29:37,706 --> 1:29:49,9
It's your right.


1662
1:29:49,9 --> 1:29:53,55
Well, what do you want?
I say he's guilty.


1663
1:29:53,55 --> 1:29:57,392
- We want to hear your arguments.
- I gave you my arguments.


1664
1:29:57,392 --> 1:29:59,603
We're not convinced.


1665
1:29:59,603 --> 1:30:2,481
We want to hear them again.


1666
1:30:2,481 --> 1:30:10,155
We have as much time as it takes.


1667
1:30:10,155 --> 1:30:14,701
Everything - Every single thing
that took place in that courtroom...


1668
1:30:14,701 --> 1:30:16,703
but I mean everything -
says he's guilty.


1669
1:30:16,703 --> 1:30:20,832
What do you think,
I'm an idiot or something?


1670
1:30:20,832 --> 1:30:23,1
Why don't you take that stuff
about the old man?


1671
1:30:23,1 --> 1:30:27,839
The old man who lived there
and heard everything.


1672
1:30:27,839 --> 1:30:29,591
Or this business about the knife.


1673
1:30:29,591 --> 1:30:31,676
What? 'Cause he found another one
exactly like it?


1674
1:30:31,676 --> 1:30:35,97
The old man saw him
right there on the stairs!


1675
1:30:35,97 --> 1:30:39,101
What's the difference
how many seconds it was?


1676
1:30:39,101 --> 1:30:42,521
Every single thing.


1677
1:30:42,521 --> 1:30:45,774
The knife falling through
a hole in his pocket.


1678
1:30:45,774 --> 1:30:49,194
You can't prove he didn't get to the door.


1679
1:30:49,194 --> 1:30:51,696
Sure, you can take all the time,
hobble around the room.


1680
1:30:51,696 --> 1:30:56,201
But you can't prove it!


1681
1:30:56,201 --> 1:30:59,913
And what about this business
of the el and the movies?


1682
1:30:59,913 --> 1:31:3,41
There's a phony deal
if I ever heard one.


1683
1:31:3,41 --> 1:31:7,337
I'll bet ya $5,000
I'd remember the movies I saw.


1684
1:31:7,337 --> 1:31:9,673
I'm telling ya,
everything that's gone on...


1685
1:31:9,673 --> 1:31:13,593
has been twisted and turned!


1686
1:31:13,593 --> 1:31:15,762
This business with the glasses?


1687
1:31:15,762 --> 1:31:21,393
How do you know she didn't have them on?
This woman testified in open court!


1688
1:31:21,393 --> 1:31:25,438
And what about hearing the kid yell, huh?


1689
1:31:25,438 --> 1:31:29,86
I'm telling ya, I've got
all the facts here.


1690
1:31:29,86 --> 1:31:34,114
Here. Ah...


1691
1:31:34,114 --> 1:31:43,832
Well, that's it!
That's the whole case.


1692
1:31:43,832 --> 1:31:47,711
Well?


1693
1:31:47,711 --> 1:31:54,843
Say something!


1694
1:31:54,843 --> 1:31:59,97
You lousy bunch of bleeding hearts.


1695
1:31:59,97 --> 1:32:1,99
You're not gonna intimidate me.


1696
1:32:1,99 --> 1:32:6,98
I'm entitled to my opinion.


1697
1:32:6,98 --> 1:32:16,114
Rotten kids.
You work your life out!


1698
1:32:16,114 --> 1:32:22,746
I can't keep...


1699
1:32:22,746 --> 1:32:28,293
No.


1700
1:32:28,293 --> 1:32:33,506
Not guilty.


1701
1:32:33,506 --> 1:32:38,178
Not guilty.


1702
1:32:38,178 --> 1:32:50,357
Not...


1703
1:32:50,357 --> 1:34:46,181
Um, we're ready now.


1704
1:34:46,181 --> 1:34:52,187
Hey!


1705
1:34:52,187 --> 1:34:53,938
What's your name?


1706
1:34:53,938 --> 1:34:55,523
Davis.


1707
1:34:55,523 --> 1:34:59,778
My name's McCardle.


1708
1:34:59,778 --> 1:35:1,529
Well, so long.


1709
1:35:1,529 --> 1:37:1,529
So long.
