filming Preston.


208
0:6:21,25 --> 0:6:23,45
ERIC KOSTON: I'm
claustrophobic.


209
0:6:23,45 --> 0:6:24,865
This is phenomenal.


210
0:6:24,865 --> 0:6:26,35
It's for the kids, so I'm gonna
keep them here a little


211
0:6:26,35 --> 0:6:29,9
longer so they buy more shit.


212
0:6:29,9 --> 0:6:31,14
Basically, the longer they're
here, the more money they


213
0:6:31,14 --> 0:6:32,39
spend, right?


214
0:6:32,39 --> 0:6:34,64



215
0:6:34,64 --> 0:6:35,64
MALE SPEAKERS: Koston!

226
0:6:47,64 --> 0:6:49,284
MALE SPEAKER: All right,
what's he doing wrong?


227
0:6:49,284 --> 0:6:51,272
MALE SPEAKER: He's going
on the wrong side.


228
0:6:51,272 --> 0:6:54,5
The whole feng shui of this
trick, and you're going this


229
0:6:54,5 --> 0:6:55,745
way on the right side
of the rail.


230
0:6:55,745 --> 0:6:58,727
It's a lot, just mentally
makes it work.


231
0:6:58,727 --> 0:7:0,715
Eric Koston likes to
challenge himself.


232
0:7:0,715 --> 0:7:3,697
Do it on this side,
he'll do it.


233
0:7:3,697 --> 0:7:6,182
MALE SPEAKER: Koston!


234
0:7:6,182 --> 0:7:9,0
MALE SPEAKER: He said this kid
gave him like, the gnarliest


235
0:7:9,0 --> 0:7:10,33
motivational speech.


236
0:7:10,33 --> 0:7:12,2
Hey, what did you tell him?


237
0:7:12,2 --> 0:7:12,61
MALE SPEAKER: Huh?


238
0:7:12,61 --> 0:7:13,396
MALE SPEAKER: What did you
tell him to try to


239
0:7:13,396 --> 0:7:14,8
get him to do it?


240
0:7:14,8 --> 0:7:15,785
MALE SPEAKER: I said if he
doesn't get it, Sean's gonna


241
0:7:15,785 --> 0:7:17,86
get his wife, his dog,
and his house.


242
0:7:17,86 --> 0:7:20,115
And his [INAUDIBLE].


243
0:7:20,115 --> 0:7:21,243
MALE SPEAKER: And then
when Sean landed


244
0:7:21,243 --> 0:7:21,95
the trick, he said--


245
0:7:21,95 --> 0:7:23,744
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, I said do it
right now, or you're a bitch.


246
0:7:23,744 --> 0:7:28,217



247
0:7:28,217 --> 0:7:29,708

0:7:29,708 --> 0:7:30,958

0:8:6,67 --> 0:8:9,792
I know where all the fucking
sickest spots are.


262
0:8:9,792 --> 0:8:10,89

by my friend Lorenzo.


275
0:8:29,58 --> 0:8:32,27
And it's a grown ass
man fan t-shirt.


276
0:8:32,27 --> 0:8:36,86
I mean, everybody rips, but I
think everybody has to be over


277
0:8:36,86 --> 0:8:39,919
30-years-old to be on this thing
that and just fucking


278
0:8:39,919 --> 0:8:41,169
