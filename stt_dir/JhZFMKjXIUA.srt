JACOB SOBOROFF: Hey,
it's Oscar weekend.


3
0:0:1,64 --> 0:0:3,88
We're grabbing some popcorn,
we're watching some videos,


4
0:0:3,88 --> 0:0:4,754
we're having a party.


5
0:0:4,754 --> 0:0:8,432



6
0:0:8,432 --> 0:0:10,39
To get you in the spirit,
we've got the trailer


7
0:0:10,39 --> 0:0:11,951
for every Oscar
winning movie ever.


8
0:0:11,951 --> 0:0:13,7
Cracked posted this
almost four years ago,


9
0:0:13,7 --> 0:0:16,64
and it still holds up.


10
0:0:16,64 --> 0:0:19,41
MALE SPEAKER: Differences
are surfacing between us.


11
0:0:19,41 --> 0:0:22,426
FEMALE SPEAKER: Accusations
about your sexuality.


12
0:0:22,426 --> 0:0:24,3
MALE SPEAKER: Suspicion
that a character once


13
0:0:24,3 --> 0:0:26,709
thought trustworthy
may not be trustworthy.


14
0:0:26,709 --> 0:0:28,75
JACOB SOBOROFF: It's almost
at two million views.


15
0:0:28,75 --> 0:0:30,124
From the music to
the characters,


16
0:0:30,124 --> 0:0:33,2
if there was an Academy Award
for Academy Award parodies,


17
0:0:33,2 --> 0:0:34,669
this thing gets it.

CARLY: We all know that "Captain
Phillips" is up for an Oscar


19
0:0:37,21 --> 0:0:38,334
for Best Picture this year.


20
0:0:38,334 --> 0:0:39,34
I'm the captain now.


21
0:0:39,34 --> 0:0:40,11
Am I right?


22
0:0:40,11 --> 0:0:42,2
But did you know that it's
not the only film made


23
0:0:42,2 --> 0:0:43,15
about modern piracy?


24
0:0:43,15 --> 0:0:45,91
"Fishing without Nets" handles
the subject matter completely


25
0:0:45,91 --> 0:0:48,17
different, and is told
entirely from the perspective


26
0:0:48,17 --> 0:0:50,53
of Somali pirates before
they reach the boat.

CARLY: This film is
a great companion


30
0:1:8,69 --> 0:1:9,606
to "Captain Phillips."


31
0:1:9,606 --> 0:1:11,7
I definitely recommend
going and seeing both,


32
0:1:11,7 --> 0:1:14,584
but not if you ever want to
feel safe on a boat again.

like your Oscars?


34
0:1:16,0 --> 0:1:16,5

How do you like your facts?

41
0:1:24,83 --> 0:1:27,6
you know Marlon Brando sent a
Native American woman to refuse


42
0:1:27,6 --> 0:1:29,309
his Best Actor award
for "The Godfather"?


43
0:1:29,309 --> 0:1:31,974
Well, I thought all the facts in
this "Little-Known Oscar Facts"

be well known facts.

Turns out they're all
little-known known facts.

Whoa.

Framestore, the company
behind the space magic,


51
0:1:42,936 --> 0:1:44,56
just posted this
behind-the-scenes look


52
0:1:44,56 --> 0:1:46,476
at how CGI played into
the making of the film.


53
0:1:46,476 --> 0:1:48,9
They actually
animated every shot


54
0:1:48,9 --> 0:1:49,715
before they even
brought the actors in.


55
0:1:49,715 --> 0:2:0,96



56
0:2:0,96 --> 0:2:4,1
I love this because it feels
like a Blu-ray extra feature


57
0:2:4,1 --> 0:2:5,43
without having to buy a Blu-ray.


58
0:2:5,43 --> 0:2:6,73
Also, if you're like me and
you haven't seen "Gravity,"


59
0:2:6,73 --> 0:2:8,396
it's just a good way
to quickly catch up

this week, I brought


62
0:2:11,53 --> 0:2:14,17
in a video that was one of
my favorite new discoveries


63
0:2:14,17 --> 0:2:17,25
of all time from a
channel called Dos Padres.


64
0:2:17,25 --> 0:2:19,9
And they have made a video
where they recreate scenes


65
0:2:19,9 --> 0:2:22,18
from each of the best picture
nominees for the Academy


66
0:2:22,18 --> 0:2:22,68

you trim the fat?


68
0:2:24,96 --> 0:2:27,2
MALE SPEAKER: Do I trim--
yeah, I trim the fat.


69
0:2:27,2 --> 0:2:28,89
I stay lean.


70
0:2:28,89 --> 0:2:30,68
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
how many times a week?


71
0:2:30,68 --> 0:2:33,2
MALE SPEAKER: Three
or four times a week.


72
0:2:33,2 --> 0:2:37,16
MALE SPEAKER: I myself, I trim
the fat at least twice a day.


73
0:2:37,16 --> 0:2:37,92
MALE SPEAKER: Wow.


74
0:2:37,92 --> 0:2:40,207
MALE SPEAKER: Once in the
morning, along with my eggs,


75
0:2:40,207 --> 0:2:42,79
and once at lunch, right before
I slip myself into a nice BLT.

wonderful, and silly,

best picture winner ever,


84
0:3:3,82 --> 0:3:5,8

to see true passion,


97
0:3:27,31 --> 0:3:29,16
