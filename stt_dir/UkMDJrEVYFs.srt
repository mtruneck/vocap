What's happening Food Tube? I'm back and I'm
going share with you one of the best kept


2
0:0:8,99 --> 0:0:14,139
secrets in my neighbourhood. West Indian fried
chicken with banana and guava ketchup.


3
0:0:14,139 --> 0:0:19,57
I got this secret from one of my friends Patrick
who works in a West Indian takeaway in Uxbridge


4
0:0:19,57 --> 0:0:24,6
road. And mate, it's amazing. Trust me.
First things first, I've got my chicken. These


5
0:0:24,6 --> 0:0:28,7
are the cheaper cuts of meat, were got the
thigh and we've got the leg. Loads of flavour,


6
0:0:28,7 --> 0:0:32,379
keep the bone on, that's what it's all about
you want to suck all that lovely flavour off.


7
0:0:32,379 --> 0:0:36,29
I'm getting hungry talking about it. Right,
let's season these up.


8
0:0:36,29 --> 0:0:41,1
Salt and pepper. It's a must, we're not putting
no chilli so any heat is going to come from


9
0:0:41,1 --> 0:0:45,73
this pepper. We've got garlic powder. Make
sure you get every single piece of chicken.


10
0:0:45,73 --> 0:0:51,239
Okay, with these spices. Some dried herbs.
It could be rosemary, it could be sage. I


11
0:0:51,239 --> 0:0:54,649
like to use a mixture of all of them.
Let's getting exciting in there. Now look


12
0:0:54,649 --> 0:1:1,11
at this, now this allspice. Now you can find
it in most supermarkets, okay. It's pretty


13
0:1:1,11 --> 0:1:6,219
much an essential in West Indian cooking,
there's nothing else like it.


14
0:1:6,219 --> 0:1:11,27
Now I'm just going to mix it up together,
like dry. I keep the skin on because I think


15
0:1:11,27 --> 0:1:13,45
it crisps up nice in the oil. Alright? More
flavour.


16
0:1:13,45 --> 0:1:19,7
That's what it's all about.
Now I would leave that fro an hour, two hours,


17
0:1:19,7 --> 0:1:23,78
overnight would be ideal. But I'm hungry,
the crew's hungry, so let's crack on with


18
0:1:23,78 --> 0:1:27,85
it.
I'm just going to shallow fry it first. I


19
0:1:27,85 --> 0:1:32,2
just want to get a nice bit of colour. So
not too much oil. To be honest with you it's


20
0:1:32,2 --> 0:1:35,869
only really crisping up the skin and it can
be finished in the oven.


21
0:1:35,869 --> 0:1:42,88
Right, so. Let's pop this on, there you go
you want it as high as you can go. A little


22
0:1:42,88 --> 0:1:47,549
tip for you. To see if the oil is ready and
hot to fry in, you want to just drop a bit


23
0:1:47,549 --> 0:1:52,759
of salt in. If it goes crazy then you're ready.
Yup, he's ready. There you go.


24
0:1:52,759 --> 0:1:57,52
Be careful use a pair of tongs, alright there's
going to be a bit of spitting. Because obviously


25
0:1:57,52 --> 0:2:2,369
there's a lot of moisture in the chicken.
Do about three at a time because what happens


26
0:2:2,369 --> 0:2:8,329
the temperature drops.
We're doing both sides. Skin side first. Lovely.


27
0:2:8,329 --> 0:2:12,95
Let's have a look at this one.
You want it to go nice and dark brown. That's


28
0:2:12,95 --> 0:2:15,99
enough because it's going to go back into
the oven. Right?


29
0:2:15,99 --> 0:2:20,86
I've got my roasting tray over here and ready
to go in the left hand, tongs in the right


30
0:2:20,86 --> 0:2:24,239
hand. Very important you don't mix em up because
look what happens!


31
0:2:24,239 --> 0:2:32,4
Can't do it! Doesn't make sense.
Right, here we go. A nice bit of chicken.


32
0:2:32,4 --> 0:2:37,489
Let's throw in a drumstick. Throw it in there,
have a little swim.


33
0:2:37,489 --> 0:2:45,75
It's looking good, it's looking fresh. that's
ready now. Phase one is done. We've seasoned


34
0:2:45,75 --> 0:2:51,91
it. Phase two's done. We've fried it.
Now for phase 3 in the oven, half an hour


35
0:2:51,91 --> 0:2:56,86
180!
Oh yes, look at that! It's started to brown


36
0:2:56,86 --> 0:3:2,29
up a nice bit there. See that? Nice and crunchy.
Fantastic. Bit of foil on that, watch your


37
0:3:2,29 --> 0:3:7,89
hands on this bit here. Just pop that on.
We want to penetrate all that chicken in there


38
0:3:7,89 --> 0:3:13,19
with the steam and the flavours, so it goes
tender and juicy. I'm going to turn this temperature


39
0:3:13,19 --> 0:3:20,5
down because we don't want it to boil up.
We want it to just simmer away in there. Okay?


40
0:3:20,5 --> 0:3:29,93
So 130, an hour.
Boom! See you in a bit.


41
0:3:29,93 --> 0:3:37,9
Okay guys, phwoar! Beautiful colour, really,
really moist. That's literally just falling


42
0:3:37,9 --> 0:3:43,59
off of the bone. Wow! That's why, what's why
you cook it low, that's why you cook it slow.


43
0:3:43,59 --> 0:3:50,43
You can't rush art.Absolutely not!
Chipotle chilli paste. Really, really nice.


44
0:3:50,43 --> 0:3:54,79
Just a splash of it in there. I like a bit
of spice, if you don't, don't worry about


45
0:3:54,79 --> 0:4:0,22
it, just eat it like this. But I'm just going
to introduce it to all that lovely juice there.


46
0:4:0,22 --> 0:4:2,47
Don't tell me you're not going to make that.
You know you're going to make it.


47
0:4:2,47 --> 0:4:6,659
Here we go, let's plate up.
I've got this lovely little baby gem lettuce


48
0:4:6,659 --> 0:4:10,819
here. You can dress that with a little bit
of oil just to be sociable. Let's get some


49
0:4:10,819 --> 0:4:16,109
of this chicken in here, look.
Boom!


50
0:4:16,109 --> 0:4:21,589
Wonderful ketchup we made, Banana and Guava
check it out. A little bit of that on top.


51
0:4:21,589 --> 0:4:28,729
Just to finish it off, some spring onion,
lovely. West Indian fried chicken. Aaron styley!


52
0:4:28,729 --> 0:4:33,71
Yeah!
Ahh mate, melt in the mouth, falls off the


53
0:4:33,71 --> 0:4:38,21
bone. Easy to make. Guys, you've got to get
involved in this one. If you don't you are


54
0:4:38,21 --> 0:4:39,659
a fool!
