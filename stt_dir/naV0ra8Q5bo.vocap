###174 Because l promise you, we're a family here.
###178 Let's go get 'em, doctors.
###182 They're buying it.
###184 ''The Devil's greatest trick was convincing the world he didn't exist.''
###187 <i>Baby</i>
###188 <i>Girl</i>
###190 - You two are dorks. - l gotta go.
###193 l gotta go meet up with my med student up in Surgery.
###196 Know who you're getting?
###198 Nope, but it's probably someone black.
###201 - <i>Sugar darlin'</i> - <i>Girl</i>
###203 So, l want someone l can be friends with, you know?
###207 l hope l get a jerk. l took so much crap as a med student
###211 that l've been waiting for the day l get to make someone suffer.
###215 Listen, nurse.
###217 l'm looking for a Dr Elliot Reid.
###219 l'm Elliot Reid.
###221 Guy's name, guy's job, guy's clothes...
###224 Anything else you wanna tell me?
###227 Goody! You're a jerk.
###232 Just remember to breathe, and you'll get through the day.
###236 Josh? Hi, l'm Dr Dorian.
###240 l know what this looks like, but...
###242 l do that all the time.
###245 Do you ever part your hair on the wrong side
###248 to see what you look like to other people?
###251 No.
###252 lt totally messes everyone up.
###255 Do you have any questions?
###257 What's the babe situation like here?
###260 Easy, tiger.
###267 Have you seen a med student here?
###269 Yeah. Me.
###271 Cool. Nice to meet you, ma'am.
###274 Actually, the only people that call me ''ma'am'' are nobody.
###278 No. l use ''ma'am'' all the time. Watch.
###280 What up, ma'am?
###283 - See? lt's my thing. - Yeah, right.
###287 Come on. l'm here to learn.
###289 Listen up, kid. Lesson number one:
###291 All surgical interns? They're dogs.
###293 - Not a problem. - Hey, baby.
###295 This overbearing machismo is usually just compensation for a lap-pinkie.
###300 That's cold!
###303 What just happened?
###305 Don't worry about it. lt's all good in the 'hood.
###310 l'll tell you what l expect. You parted your hair on the other side?
###315 You're gonna do H & Ps, write admission orders...
###318 What are you doing?
###320 l can't walk and write at the same time.
###322 - lt makes me nauseous. - <i>A famous doctor once said</i>
###325 <i>''Show me a med student that only</i> <i>triples my work and I'll kiss his feet, ''</i>
###329 Philip, l need you to shave his groin so l can place a femoral triple-lumen.
###334 l'm not so much with the ''shavin' a guy's curlies''.
###338 lf you get just one bad evaluation from me,
###341 it'll torch your class rank, so do what l tell you.
###344 And if l ask you to shave a groin,
###346 thank your lucky stars that l said ''shave''.
###353 l'll tell you what.
###355 l'll lather you up, and you think about baseball.
###359 Natural redhead.
###363 l'll need you to change the dressing on the fem bypass in 402,
###366 and DC the staples on the gastroplasty in post-op.
###369 l have no idea what you just said.
###373 l'm kidding.
###375 Looks like you won the med student raffle there, pal.
###381 - lntroduce me. - Excuse me?
###383 You give me her name and tell her my name,
###386 or you go her name, my name, my name, her name.
###389 No. You like Carla.
###392 Do you actually listen to yourself when you speak,
###395 or do you find you drift in and out?
###398 Fine. Then l'm gonna go ahead
###401 and continue to focus all my energies on Carla.
###404 Listening, watching...
###407 ...waiting.
###410 Dr Cox, Kristen. Kristen, Dr Cox.
###415 Josh, l asked you to get this guy's history an hour ago.
###419 lt should've taken five minutes.
###422 We were just talking. This guy, he is the bomb!
###426 OK. Bye-bye. Moving on.
###428 Help someone else. l'm sorry about that.
###431 Relax, Bambi. Be nice to Thumper.
###433 He wrote ''The guy sweats when he exercises.''
###435 - l do. - l'll call Ripley's!
###437 Relax. lt's just one mistake.
###441 Relax, Bambi.
###442 lt's just one mistake.
###445 - Good night, Thumper. - Cool! Great first day, Dr Dorian.
###449 Yeah, it was.
###453 - Relax. lt's just one mistake. - Yes! They're each one mistake.
###456 Put 'em all together, it makes four million.
###459 Did you just snap at me? Because l think he just snapped at me.
###463 - l'm sorry. - Yeah, you are.
###465 Carla, l gotta go home.
###467 You have to co-sign all these orders,
###470 fill out a vascular consult on bed three and get a tox screen for Mrs O'Brien.
###474 - But Josh did all this. - Honey, l don't think so.
###496 Mrs O'Brien, l'm afraid l'm gonna need a urine sample.
###500 l hope you're taking very good care of my hospital.
###503 You're darn tootin'.
###506 Jackass. Dr Reid, say hello to Whitaker Chambers.
###510 - What up? - ''What up''?
###513 Whitaker Chambers is the CEO
###516 of the corporation that owns this hospital,
###518 so l suggest you stop acting like LL Cool Reid
###522 and start acting like Dr Reid.
###525 You dig?
###526 - Why would he want to meet me? - Hey, Dad.
###529 Hey, son!
###532 Poopies.
###535 - lt was really nice to meet you. - Same here, doctor.
###542 l'm sorry. Dr Cox,
###544 l was gonna take Kristen out for a beer after work.
###547 Would you like to join us?
###551 No. l can't do it.
###554 No!
###556 - ls he OK? - Not really.
###561 Dr Dorian?
###566 Your roommate let me in.
###570 Cool dead dog. Can l pet him?
###572 <i>Is he kidding?</i>
###573 l came by because l know l didn't do so great yesterday...
###577 What is it that tipped you off?
###579 Was it your inability to perform even the simplest task?
###583 l'll bet it was that l got home 20 minutes ago
###586 because l spent the entire night cleaning up after you.
###589 l'm sorry. l was just really scared.
###594 You know what, Josh? You should be scared.
###597 Because l gotta be honest with you.
###600 l don't think you got what it takes.
###602 Do you?
###608 l didn't think so.
###614 l'm still not gonna feel bad about what l said to Josh.
###619 You don't scare me, woman.
###623 l'm so sorry. l'll apologise at rounds.
###626 Nurse Roberts, have you seen Josh?
###628 The tall skinny one? He quit.
###631 Nice job, Bambi.
###633 l didn't mean for that to happen. l didn't.
###637 You don't have to apologise to me.
###639 You will have to answer to Jesus.
###650 <i>After what happened</i> <i>I did what any good person would do,</i>
###653 <i>I went looking for confirmation</i> <i>that it wasn't my fault,</i>
###657 Here's what happened.
###659 He was screwing up constantly.
###661 l didn't force him to quit.
###663 l don't think it's my fault he quit.
###666 Most of the bad things that happen here are your fault.
###669 - l was talking to her. - l won't say what you wanna hear.
###672 Nurse Roberts says he's the most incompetent doctor she's worked with.
###676 Laverne, what'd you say about JD when he first started working here?
###679 He was the most incompetent doctor l ever worked with.
###682 - lt's not my fault he failed. - You failed.
###684 You're supposed to be his teacher.
###689 See, to me that sounds like it's your fault. l don't know.
###693 Shocker. Yeah.
###695 Where you going? Stay and play!
###705 So you're having trouble asking out Kristen.
###709 - No problem. - Whoa, Curly.
###711 l got no problem. Wanna have a drink?
###713 - No. - See? l'm fine.
###715 You know how men are always talking about themselves?
###719 Women like to talk about themselves more.
###721 Thank you. You've touched me deeply.
###723 You can be cynical, but l'm telling you,
###726 get Kristen to talk about herself, it's on. lt's on and poppin'.
###730 - lf that doesn't work, do what l do. - Which is what?
###735 - Show her the booty! - No. You put that away.
###740 Think of the children.
###742 Doctor!
###744 Philip, l was wondering if you could write out this discharge summary.
###749 Where's the fun?
###750 - Excuse me? - From now on,
###752 when you're wondering whether l'll do something,
###755 ask yourself, ''Where's the fun?''
###757 lt'll be a timesaver for both of us.
###759 l'm betting that if you were really honest with yourself,
###763 you'd realise how unsatisfying it is to ride on your father's coattails.
###768 No, l'm OK with it.
###775 Josh, this is completely crazy.
###779 You told me l shouldn't be a doctor.
###781 Kidding... Josh.
###783 You know what? Forget all of that. You have to hang in there.
###788 Now, l promise you, l am gonna help you.
###791 Here we go.
###794 You're doing it.
###797 Yeah, you are! You're doing it!
###800 - So, what do you say? - l know what you're trying to do.
###804 My whole life, people have felt sorry for me.
###807 - Why would anyone feel sorry for you? - l'm clumsy,
###810 l'm always throwing up, l don't even have an ass!
###813 Those are the same things l was dealing with when l started here.
###817 Except for the ass part. l actually have a great ass.
###820 lt's firm like mutton.
###822 l'm not buying it, Dr Dorian.
###825 But thanks for trying.
###830 - So, where you from? - Chicago. You?
###832 - Pittsburgh. Family? Brothers, sisters? - One older brother. You?
###836 We're gonna keep the focus on you. Are your parents still together?
###841 Yep.
###842 Do you have any idea how hard you're making this on me?
###845 No, but l wonder if someone slipped something into my soda.
###848 He has that effect on everyone the first few weeks.
###852 l gotta go. We'll pick this up later.
###856 Pick what up?
###861 What up, dawg?
###863 Not a strong move with the tighty-whities.
###872 lf you won't help, go wait for your trust fund to mature.
###875 - Dr Reid, can l see you a minute? - Dr Kelso, l am so, so sorry.
###880 l just got so frustrated, plus l'm PMSing.
###883 Well, the pill plays havoc with my cycle. l'm like...
###886 Dr Reid?
###888 You talk too much. lt's a problem.
###890 Why are you doing your med student's work?
###892 - Well, his father... - l hate his father.
###895 But l'm the one who has to suck up to him, not you.
###898 For God's sake, woman, show some <i>cojones!</i>
###907 <i>It's hard trying to figure out</i> <i>how to reach somebody,</i>
###911 <i>The thing is to think</i> <i>of someone I look up to</i>
###913 <i>and remember</i> <i>how they got through to me,</i>
###916 The only way you could be less productive
###918 is if you were the wall on which you're leaning.
###921 But then you'd be providing some jackass
###924 with a wall on which to lean and reflect on what a jackass he is.
###927 l know. Here it's a conundrum. But don't you worry about it.
###931 l'll tackle that one right upstairs. ln the meantime,
###934 you could pretend to be doing some work.
###937 And, even though you don't have your basket,
###939 it's just a terrific time for you to skip away, Shirley.
###943 Skip away.
###945 Skip away. Go ahead.
###952 - Hello, Philip. - Lemon head.
###956 Yeah, l get it, cos of the hair.
###958 l was hard on you from the start,
###960 but, on the other hand, as you know, you're an incredible tool.
###963 So l'll lay off if you drop the attitude, and we'll start fresh.
###967 - What do you say? - l don't wanna.
###970 But, if you've got a problem with that, go see my father.
###973 l think l'll do that.
###976 Wait, Dr Reid.
###978 l had some time to think about it and, what the hell? Let's start fresh.
###984 Philly...
###986 l don't wanna.
###989 Sorry we got interrupted before.
###991 - lt's OK. - Where were we?
###995 l told you my parents were still married, you yelled at me.
###998 Right. Of course l did. That's me all over.
###1001 - Why are you washing your hands? - l don't honestly know.
###1005 l guess l don't have anything of interest to say.
###1008 l got something to say.
###1011 Dr Cox, you are an attending, so you should know
###1014 it's inappropriate for you to be sniffing around this woman all day!
###1018 And you! You are a med student who should be learning from me,
###1022 but every time l turn around, you're talking to him.
###1025 So l'm telling you, l forbid you to get involved with that guy.
###1029 Sorry, doctor.
###1031 You do realise that you just effectively signed your own death warrant.
###1037 Dude, do you, like, know any women at all?
###1044 Hi.
###1046 l know we're not supposed to be seeing each other, but...
###1055 Why did you page me?
###1057 l don't know why l still have this thing on.
###1060 Put your gloves on, Josh. l need you to get an ABG.
###1063 - l can't. - Newbie, wait.
###1066 ''Newbie''?
###1067 You're the only one who knows if you wanna be a doctor.
###1070 But right now l got my hands full. OK?
###1073 What do you say you put some gloves on, Shirley, and get the hell in here?
###1081 Now, locate the radial pulse.
###1086 Josh, look at me. You can do this.
###1097 lt looks good.
###1100 No way.
###1102 What do you want, a cookie? Put your scrubs on and get back here.
###1106 Go, go, go!
###1110 Go ahead.
###1112 That's it.
###1115 - Could you redo that? - Yeah.
###1119 Could l get some more wine?
###1121 Puh-lease, keep drinking.
###1126 l'm throwing myself at you, and you're still trying to get me drunk.
###1130 Well, baby, you gotta play all 48 minutes.
###1136 - Cheers. - Cheers.
###1138 This is fun.
###1140 l love the part right before we start hating each other.
###1143 - Really? - You wanna know something?
###1146 What?
###1148 l feel like l'm using you to get past another person.
###1152 That's not as sexy as you think it is.
###1154 lt's this nurse.
###1156 This unavailable nurse? l swear...
###1160 Look, Kristen, l think you're great,
###1163 but this whole thing's just not fair to you.
###1166 lf it's OK with you,
###1169 l think l'll go ahead and decide what's fair to me.
###1186 That works for everybody.
###1189 Perry?
###1191 Actually, l prefer ''Dr Cox''.
###1194 You like strong women, don't you?
###1197 Are you kidding me? They're the only ones l let ruin my life.
###1205 - This is way too easy. - Bring it on!
###1209 Stop talking.
###1213 Dr Reid, l wrote out your admission orders and got the blood cultures.
###1217 Good. Now, beat it. l'm eating.
###1222 - Elliot, you ball-buster! - l know! lsn't it great?
###1226 <i>A lot of us freak out</i> <i>when med students come,</i>
