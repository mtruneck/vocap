0:0:20,47 --> 0:0:23,43
HARRY CHEADLE: Everyone I know
reveres Louis C.K. even though


3
0:0:23,43 --> 0:0:25,47
he's a fat, bald, middle-aged
dude who talks


4
0:0:25,47 --> 0:0:27,48
about his dick on stage.


5
0:0:27,48 --> 0:0:29,34
That's the great thing about
stand-up comedy.


6
0:0:29,34 --> 0:0:31,4
All that matters is that
you make people laugh.


7
0:0:31,4 --> 0:0:34,23
And like a lot of people who
think they're funny, I've


8
0:0:34,23 --> 0:0:36,9
always believed that maybe I
could do stand up, too, if I


9
0:0:36,9 --> 0:0:39,6
only took a shot at it.


10
0:0:39,6 --> 0:0:40,44
That was my first mistake.


11
0:0:40,44 --> 0:0:44,0



12
0:0:44,0 --> 0:0:45,55
My name is Harry, and
I've been a loser


13
0:0:45,55 --> 0:0:46,89
for most of my life.


14
0:0:46,89 --> 0:0:49,13
I thought I was done with my
awkward phase when Vice hired


15
0:0:49,13 --> 0:0:51,77
me to write about politics,
culture, and other important


16
0:0:51,77 --> 0:0:55,26
world affairs which should make
me cool, but it doesn't.


17
0:0:55,26 --> 0:0:57,57
I'm still just a weird kid
who creeps people out.


18
0:0:57,57 --> 0:0:59,375
This is "All Around Losing"
with Harry Cheadle.


19
0:0:59,375 --> 0:1:2,25



20
0:1:2,25 --> 0:1:4,814
So I'm out here in front of the
Sidewalk Cafe where they


21
0:1:4,814 --> 0:1:7,33
have an open mic every night.


22
0:1:7,33 --> 0:1:9,46
I am incredibly nervous
right now.


23
0:1:9,46 --> 0:1:11,25
I've written my set
list on my hand.


24
0:1:11,25 --> 0:1:14,26
As you can see, it goes
from porn to sex-ed to


25
0:1:14,26 --> 0:1:15,56
Obama at the end.


26
0:1:15,56 --> 0:1:18,4
And I don't think this is going
to go well, but I'm also


27
0:1:18,4 --> 0:1:20,88
confident this is going to go
well because I'm just a


28
0:1:20,88 --> 0:1:22,12
massive contradiction.


29
0:1:22,12 --> 0:1:24,47
But here I go.


30
0:1:24,47 --> 0:1:26,535
-Make some noise for Harry
as he comes to stage.


31
0:1:26,535 --> 0:1:29,138



32
0:1:29,138 --> 0:1:30,97
HARRY CHEADLE: You guys are
really attractive out there.


33
0:1:30,97 --> 0:1:33,18
The terrifying part of doing
stand-up is when you get to


34
0:1:33,18 --> 0:1:34,9
the punch lines.


35
0:1:34,9 --> 0:1:36,8
Are people going to laugh?


36
0:1:36,8 --> 0:1:37,12
Are they going to boo?


37
0:1:37,12 --> 0:1:39,91
Are they going to know I have
no business being on stage?


38
0:1:39,91 --> 0:1:41,49
There almost has to be something
wrong with you to


39
0:1:41,49 --> 0:1:43,86
expose yourself to a situation
like that.


40
0:1:43,86 --> 0:1:46,18
But surprisingly, the crowd at
the Sidewalk laughed at all


41
0:1:46,18 --> 0:1:46,89
the right times.


42
0:1:46,89 --> 0:1:47,48
[LAUGHTER]


43
0:1:47,48 --> 0:1:48,29
HARRY CHEADLE: Sex is gross.


44
0:1:48,29 --> 0:1:50,6
Sex is just the two weirdest
parts of your body just


45
0:1:50,6 --> 0:1:52,52
colliding over and over.


46
0:1:52,52 --> 0:1:52,842
[LAUGHTER]


47
0:1:52,842 --> 0:1:55,12
HARRY CHEADLE: If I went back
in time and talked to my


48
0:1:55,12 --> 0:1:58,29
11-year-old self about the sex
I was having, he'd be like,


49
0:1:58,29 --> 0:1:58,985
that's gross.


50
0:1:58,985 --> 0:2:1,6
And he'd be right, and I think
I'd probably go to jail for


51
0:2:1,6 --> 0:2:3,33
talking to an 11-year-old
about sex anyway.


52
0:2:3,33 --> 0:2:4,22
[LAUGHTER]


53
0:2:4,22 --> 0:2:7,95
Even the guy who heckled
me was polite.


54
0:2:7,95 --> 0:2:10,72
I will, and I have a whole
bunch of jokes about sex.


55
0:2:10,72 --> 0:2:13,47



56
0:2:13,47 --> 0:2:15,45
I don't know.


57
0:2:15,45 --> 0:2:17,771
I guess I'm going to keep going
on with the jokes I have


58
0:2:17,771 --> 0:2:19,735
in my head, if you don't mind.


59
0:2:19,735 --> 0:2:23,55



60
0:2:23,55 --> 0:2:27,33
Oh yeah, let me talk more
about sex for a second.


61
0:2:27,33 --> 0:2:28,8
Maybe I was just good at this?


62
0:2:28,8 --> 0:2:29,974
Thanks, you guys have
been great.


63
0:2:29,974 --> 0:2:33,383
[APPLAUSE]


64
0:2:33,383 --> 0:2:33,87
-Harry.


65
0:2:33,87 --> 0:2:35,818
It's his first time,
everybody.


66
0:2:35,818 --> 0:2:39,23



67
0:2:39,23 --> 0:2:41,59
HARRY CHEADLE: I didn't do too
badly my first time on stage


68
0:2:41,59 --> 0:2:44,13
which was surprising because I
blacked out and have no memory


69
0:2:44,13 --> 0:2:45,77
of the experience whatsoever.


70
0:2:45,77 --> 0:2:49,185
When I came to, it was already
time for my second show at Cha


71
0:2:49,185 --> 0:2:50,92
Cha's Comedy Club.


72
0:2:50,92 --> 0:2:54,11
On my way inside, I ran into Cha
Cha himself, a spherical,


73
0:2:54,11 --> 0:2:56,13
Hawaiian-shirted, comedy
guru who's been in the


74
0:2:56,13 --> 0:2:58,635
business for decades.


75
0:2:58,635 --> 0:3:0,42
CHA CHA: How long you've
been doing this?


76
0:3:0,42 --> 0:3:2,45
HARRY CHEADLE: I've been doing
like a week, honestly.


77
0:3:2,45 --> 0:3:3,929
CHA CHA: A week, right?


78
0:3:3,929 --> 0:3:35,811



79
0:3:35,811 --> 0:3:37,162
-Please put your hands together
and welcome to the


80
0:3:37,162 --> 0:3:38,412
stage Harry Cheadle.


81
0:3:38,412 --> 0:3:41,29



82
0:3:41,29 --> 0:3:44,96
HARRY CHEADLE: When I have sex
it's like I'm a blind man in a


83
0:3:44,96 --> 0:3:47,81
bouncy castle trying
to kill a frog.


84
0:3:47,81 --> 0:3:50,66
It's not clear how that blind
man got in that situation,


85
0:3:50,66 --> 0:3:53,44
like it doesn't make any sense,
like why is he here.


86
0:3:53,44 --> 0:3:57,97
He doesn't have the skills
or the tools necessary to


87
0:3:57,97 --> 0:4:0,25
complete this task.


88
0:4:0,25 --> 0:4:3,59
There are people out there who
say like, oh, sex is this


89
0:4:3,59 --> 0:4:8,3
great, spiritual, life-affirming
thing.


90
0:4:8,3 --> 0:4:11,27
Those people have not had sex
with me because when I have


91
0:4:11,27 --> 0:4:13,12
sex it's not a spiritual
experience.


92
0:4:13,12 --> 0:4:15,44
My second time out,
I died on stage.


93
0:4:15,44 --> 0:4:17,779
Though actually dying is
probably way less painful than


94
0:4:17,779 --> 0:4:18,87
what I went through.


95
0:4:18,87 --> 0:4:21,91
All Cha Cha's Strom Thurmond
style comedy coaching did was


96
0:4:21,91 --> 0:4:24,91
distract me with thoughts
of Mexican whorehouses.


97
0:4:24,91 --> 0:4:27,35
Before I did this again, I
would need to get drunk,


98
0:4:27,35 --> 0:4:29,1
really drunk.


99
0:4:29,1 --> 0:4:30,91
I've heard that alcohol is
supposed to make you more


100
0:4:30,91 --> 0:4:34,53
confident, but instead, eh,
fuck, let me try that again.


101
0:4:34,53 --> 0:4:35,95
Have you heard that alcohol
is a good way


102
0:4:35,95 --> 0:4:37,33
to calm your nerves?


103
0:4:37,33 --> 0:4:38,58
It's not.


104
0:4:38,58 --> 0:4:43,529



105
0:4:43,529 --> 0:4:46,24
-Let's everyone please
give a warm welcome


106
0:4:46,24 --> 0:4:47,274
to Mr. Harry Cheadle.


107
0:4:47,274 --> 0:4:53,53



108
0:4:53,53 --> 0:4:55,52
HARRY CHEADLE: So you guys are
really attractive for the open


109
0:4:55,52 --> 0:4:56,98
mic audience, anyway.


110
0:4:56,98 --> 0:4:58,5
Oops, I'm gonna take
this mic off.


111
0:4:58,5 --> 0:5:0,79
The worst thing isn't
not getting a laugh.


112
0:5:0,79 --> 0:5:2,97
Who's going to get
laid tonight?


113
0:5:2,97 --> 0:5:4,22
Anyone?


114
0:5:4,22 --> 0:5:6,3



115
0:5:6,3 --> 0:5:7,42
This is going to
go really bad.


116
0:5:7,42 --> 0:5:9,68
The worst thing is knowing that
everyone out there knew


117
0:5:9,68 --> 0:5:12,9
you were trying to get a laugh,
and that you failed,


118
0:5:12,9 --> 0:5:13,54
and that you're not funny.


119
0:5:13,54 --> 0:5:15,1
Sex is disgusting.


120
0:5:15,1 --> 0:5:17,8
I'll wiggle it around
in there for awhile.


121
0:5:17,8 --> 0:5:19,74
And like, oh yeah, that sounds
great, let do that.


122
0:5:19,74 --> 0:5:24,82
And that's awesome.


123
0:5:24,82 --> 0:5:26,53
Actually, the worst
thing is that you


124
0:5:26,53 --> 0:5:27,76
keep going after that.


125
0:5:27,76 --> 0:5:30,49
This sex material is terrible.


126
0:5:30,49 --> 0:5:32,585
That was my impression
of trying to do


127
0:5:32,585 --> 0:5:33,56
sex material, everybody.


128
0:5:33,56 --> 0:5:35,472
It failed.


129
0:5:35,472 --> 0:5:36,5
That was good.


130
0:5:36,5 --> 0:5:38,59
Someone liked my material
on bombing.


131
0:5:38,59 --> 0:5:41,87



132
0:5:41,87 --> 0:5:43,98
Yeah, let me just talk more
about how bad I suck.


133
0:5:43,98 --> 0:5:46,17
That would be great.


134
0:5:46,17 --> 0:5:49,59
Man, you know, always.


135
0:5:49,59 --> 0:5:53,136
And then but women, man.


136
0:5:53,136 --> 0:5:55,24
Yeah, that stills needs
a little bit of work.


137
0:5:55,24 --> 0:5:55,83
Thank you, guys.


138
0:5:55,83 --> 0:5:58,18
You've been great.


139
0:5:58,18 --> 0:6:0,33
The best part is when
it's finally over.


140
0:6:0,33 --> 0:6:2,2
-Alright, Harry Cheadle,
everybody.


141
0:6:2,2 --> 0:6:3,66
HARRY CHEADLE: This stuff
is the most difficult


142
0:6:3,66 --> 0:6:4,5
thing I've ever done.


143
0:6:4,5 --> 0:6:7,96
And if anyone can get any laugh
from anybody in front of


144
0:6:7,96 --> 0:6:10,5
a crowd, that's like amazing.


145
0:6:10,5 --> 0:6:12,97
And anyone who does it for
a long time deserves your


146
0:6:12,97 --> 0:6:16,3
respect or your pity,
I don't know which.


147
0:6:16,3 --> 0:6:17,28
