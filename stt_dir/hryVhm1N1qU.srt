1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:4,81



2
0:0:4,81 --> 0:0:6,734
MALE SPEAKER: This way.


3
0:0:6,734 --> 0:0:8,69
William, guys, please.


4
0:0:8,69 --> 0:0:10,163
This way.


5
0:0:10,163 --> 0:0:12,127
MALE SPEAKER: This way
after he come out.


6
0:0:12,127 --> 0:0:12,618
PAPARAZZO: Emma, Emma.


7
0:0:12,618 --> 0:0:13,109
PAPARAZZO: Emma.


8
0:0:13,109 --> 0:0:13,6
PAPARAZZO: Emma.


9
0:0:13,6 --> 0:0:15,73
PAPARAZZO: Down here, please.


10
0:0:15,73 --> 0:0:18,19
PAPARAZZO: Down here!


11
0:0:18,19 --> 0:0:19,269
PAPARAZZO: Get your bag!


12
0:0:19,269 --> 0:0:22,94



13
0:0:22,94 --> 0:0:24,2
STEVEN RANDOLPH NARRATING: I
think we can all agree that


14
0:0:24,2 --> 0:0:25,55
paparazzi are some of
the lowest forms of


15
0:0:25,55 --> 0:0:26,7
life on planet Earth.


16
0:0:26,7 --> 0:0:29,12
The ever-growing business of
invading public persons'


17
0:0:29,12 --> 0:0:31,8
privacy and the seemingly
insatiable appetite for such


18
0:0:31,8 --> 0:0:34,62
garbage prove that more than
ever, people are looking for


19
0:0:34,62 --> 0:0:36,5
glimpses into lives
that seem more


20
0:0:36,5 --> 0:0:37,38
interesting than their own.


21
0:0:37,38 --> 0:0:38,63
PAPARAZZO: I love you!


22
0:0:38,63 --> 0:0:43,69



23
0:0:43,69 --> 0:0:44,77
STEVEN RANDOLPH NARRATING: When
Vice asked me if I wanted


24
0:0:44,77 --> 0:0:47,7
to write a story about this
profession, I jumped at the


25
0:0:47,7 --> 0:0:48,2
opportunity.


26
0:0:48,2 --> 0:0:48,88
I had to know.


27
0:0:48,88 --> 0:0:50,54
Were they just trying
to get by?


28
0:0:50,54 --> 0:0:52,52
I decided to go directly
to the source.


29
0:0:52,52 --> 0:0:53,86
STEVEN RANDOLPH: Going down
Melrose here, where we're


30
0:0:53,86 --> 0:0:56,43
going to meet the photographer,
[BLEEP].


31
0:0:56,43 --> 0:0:58,47
I don't know his last name, and
it's probably better that


32
0:0:58,47 --> 0:1:1,86
way, you know?


33
0:1:1,86 --> 0:1:3,42
STEVEN RANDOLPH NARRATING: After
asking various contacts,


34
0:1:3,42 --> 0:1:6,3
I was put in touch with Peter,
a professional and somewhat


35
0:1:6,3 --> 0:1:8,62
jaded paparazzo, who agreed to
give me all the pertinent


36
0:1:8,62 --> 0:1:10,77
details I would need to capture
my prey in exchange


37
0:1:10,77 --> 0:1:11,5
for his anonymity.


38
0:1:11,5 --> 0:1:12,1
What is it?


39
0:1:12,1 --> 0:1:12,98
Like I--


40
0:1:12,98 --> 0:1:14,96
I don't know, like what
is a paparazzi.


41
0:1:14,96 --> 0:1:23,58



42
0:1:23,58 --> 0:1:25,1
STEVEN RANDOLPH NARRATING: He
also said that there are a


43
0:1:25,1 --> 0:1:27,12
select few freelance
photographers, such as


44
0:1:27,12 --> 0:1:29,145
himself, who adhere to a
moral code of sorts.


45
0:1:29,145 --> 0:2:2,63



46
0:2:2,63 --> 0:2:4,61
STEVEN RANDOLPH: What did
you do before this?


47
0:2:4,61 --> 0:2:6,4
Before this career as a pap?


48
0:2:6,4 --> 0:2:12,95



49
0:2:12,95 --> 0:2:15,407
STEVEN RANDOLPH: It sounds kind
of like a stripper being


50
0:2:15,407 --> 0:2:17,5
asked to be called a dancer.


51
0:2:17,5 --> 0:2:18,3
You're not really dancing.


52
0:2:18,3 --> 0:2:41,9



53
0:2:41,9 --> 0:2:42,91
STEVEN RANDOLPH NARRATING: He
also schooled me on the


54
0:2:42,91 --> 0:2:45,12
paparazzi circuit and its
respective territories.


55
0:2:45,12 --> 0:3:0,14



56
0:3:0,14 --> 0:3:1,7
STEVEN RANDOLPH NARRATING: With
this information at my


57
0:3:1,7 --> 0:3:4,0
disposal, I was ready to start
my rampage of invasiveness.


58
0:3:4,0 --> 0:3:8,4
STEVEN RANDOLPH: Gonna post up
and try to hunt the hunters.


59
0:3:8,4 --> 0:3:9,27
STEVEN RANDOLPH NARRATING: My
photographer and I headed


60
0:3:9,27 --> 0:3:12,2
straight for the guitar statue
outside BOA, a popular


61
0:3:12,2 --> 0:3:14,36
nightclub on Sunset Boulevard
frequented by celebrities.


62
0:3:14,36 --> 0:3:24,91



63
0:3:24,91 --> 0:3:26,59
STEVEN RANDOLPH: We see a huge
guitar, and there's two


64
0:3:26,59 --> 0:3:28,82
shady-looking dudes in beanies,
and they look like


65
0:3:28,82 --> 0:3:30,4
the kind of guys that are
willing to fight.


66
0:3:30,4 --> 0:3:31,9
We pulled up two blocks away.


67
0:3:31,9 --> 0:3:34,4
I'm starting to get nervous.


68
0:3:34,4 --> 0:3:35,19
STEVEN RANDOLPH NARRATING: We
parked and went over our plan,


69
0:3:35,19 --> 0:3:37,59
which basically amounted to
getting in their faces and


70
0:3:37,59 --> 0:3:39,755
asking increasingly personal
and judgmental questions.


71
0:3:39,755 --> 0:3:45,59



72
0:3:45,59 --> 0:3:48,41
STEVEN RANDOLPH: A paparazzi is
telling me to not get too


73
0:3:48,41 --> 0:3:49,895
close to the story.


74
0:3:49,895 --> 0:3:50,885
That's funny.


75
0:3:50,885 --> 0:3:51,875
Hey, homey.


76
0:3:51,875 --> 0:3:52,865
How are you?


77
0:3:52,865 --> 0:3:53,86
How are you?


78
0:3:53,86 --> 0:3:55,461
Please tell us, what are
you wearing right now?


79
0:3:55,461 --> 0:3:57,57
Who are you wearing?


80
0:3:57,57 --> 0:3:59,564
Who are you wearing?


81
0:3:59,564 --> 0:4:1,4
What does your underwear
look like?


82
0:4:1,4 --> 0:4:3,36
Please tell us.


83
0:4:3,36 --> 0:4:4,735
Who are you with?


84
0:4:4,735 --> 0:4:6,63
Do you feel bad when you
go home at night,


85
0:4:6,63 --> 0:4:7,6
doing this to people?


86
0:4:7,6 --> 0:4:11,6
Do you like a pinky in
the butt during sex?


87
0:4:11,6 --> 0:4:12,365
Sir, sir, sir!


88
0:4:12,365 --> 0:4:13,235
[POUNDING ON GLASS]


89
0:4:13,235 --> 0:4:15,65
When you're getting a blowjob,
do you like one single pinky


90
0:4:15,65 --> 0:4:16,453
in your butt?


91
0:4:16,453 --> 0:4:18,17
I'm not getting the scoop
from you, dude.


92
0:4:18,17 --> 0:4:20,4
We want to know, just
one question,


93
0:4:20,4 --> 0:4:21,649
sir, just one question.


94
0:4:21,649 --> 0:4:24,64
Do you smell the toilet paper
after you wipe, sir?


95
0:4:24,64 --> 0:4:26,9
Do you go number-two
in the workplace?


96
0:4:26,9 --> 0:4:29,38
Somehow I think in this
interview that you think


97
0:4:29,38 --> 0:4:31,952
you're holding on to some last
shred of like, what you're


98
0:4:31,952 --> 0:4:32,438
doing is art.


99
0:4:32,438 --> 0:4:32,924
It's not.


100
0:4:32,924 --> 0:4:35,354
You're taking picture of
celebrities at vulnerable


101
0:4:35,354 --> 0:4:37,298
moments without their
permission.


102
0:4:37,298 --> 0:4:38,756
They don't know who you are.


103
0:4:38,756 --> 0:4:39,88
You guys interview
other people.


104
0:4:39,88 --> 0:4:41,31
How come I'm not allowed
to interview you?


105
0:4:41,31 --> 0:4:44,49



106
0:4:44,49 --> 0:4:47,76
Does this make you feel weird?


107
0:4:47,76 --> 0:4:49,54
Why-- if you guys do this for
a living, why are you so


108
0:4:49,54 --> 0:4:51,97
pissed off that we're
doing it to you?


109
0:4:51,97 --> 0:4:55,71
STEVEN RANDOLPH: I'm
not in your face.


110
0:4:55,71 --> 0:4:57,0
I just have a quick question.


111
0:4:57,0 --> 0:4:57,71
Why are you hiding?


112
0:4:57,71 --> 0:5:0,8
Why is there so much shame
behind what you're doing?


113
0:5:0,8 --> 0:5:3,13
You don't like, you don't like
your own medicine, bro.


114
0:5:3,13 --> 0:5:5,11
You don't like the way it feels
to you, then why would--


115
0:5:5,11 --> 0:5:8,92
why would you do that to your
fellow man and woman?


116
0:5:8,92 --> 0:5:10,52
You're getting mad at me
following you around, trying


117
0:5:10,52 --> 0:5:11,96
to get a hot scoop.


118
0:5:11,96 --> 0:5:13,2
And that's what you're doing.


119
0:5:13,2 --> 0:5:17,5
That'd be like a butcher who's
afraid of eating meat.


120
0:5:17,5 --> 0:5:21,12
Why hide in bushes at a
restaurant for Paris Hilton's


121
0:5:21,12 --> 0:5:21,786
tit to fall out?


122
0:5:21,786 --> 0:5:24,372
If you're such a photographer,
why don't-- why don't you go


123
0:5:24,372 --> 0:5:26,22
and, and shoot waves
at Maui, or--?


124
0:5:26,22 --> 0:6:2,12



125
0:6:2,12 --> 0:6:3,506
STEVEN RANDOLPH: All
right, this is


126
0:6:3,506 --> 0:6:4,61
Steve for Vice Magazine.


127
0:6:4,61 --> 0:6:5,22
I thought we were
going to have a


128
0:6:5,22 --> 0:6:6,52
really crazy story here.


129
0:6:6,52 --> 0:6:8,19
I heard stories of, like,
Brazilian guys


130
0:6:8,19 --> 0:6:9,35
that love to fight.


131
0:6:9,35 --> 0:6:10,39
Thought we were going
to encounter that.


132
0:6:10,39 --> 0:6:12,59
But what we encountered
is a bunch of cowards.


133
0:6:12,59 --> 0:6:14,31
Most of these guys are just
pussies, and they're not down


134
0:6:14,31 --> 0:6:15,66
to scrap or do anything
like that.


135
0:6:15,66 --> 0:6:19,22
So, um, it was kind of a
fun story, but it was


136
0:6:19,22 --> 0:6:20,14
anti-climactic.


137
0:6:20,14 --> 0:6:22,33
Like who these guys really are,
that you see the pictures


138
0:6:22,33 --> 0:6:24,59
like on TMZ, they're a bunch
of scared guys who--


139
0:6:24,59 --> 0:6:28,6
I'm sitting here solo, kind of
like a pussy myself, and they


140
0:6:28,6 --> 0:6:29,36
don't even want to
make eye contact.


141
0:6:29,36 --> 0:6:31,41
So they feel bad about what
they're doing, and it's kind


142
0:6:31,41 --> 0:6:33,7
of like grinding someone into
the ground at this point.


143
0:6:33,7 --> 0:6:34,4
I'm gonna just take off.


144
0:6:34,4 --> 0:6:35,5
I feel bad.


145
0:6:35,5 --> 0:6:36,13
Later guys.


146
0:6:36,13 --> 0:6:38,21
Thanks for playing, man.


147
0:6:38,21 --> 0:6:39,11
Thank you.


148
0:6:39,11 --> 0:6:40,36
Good night.


149
0:6:40,36 --> 0:8:40,36
