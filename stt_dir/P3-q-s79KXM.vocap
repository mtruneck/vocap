###2 KRISTIAN VON BENGTSON: If we wanted to fly into space, we
###5 could either try to become astronauts.
###7 Like, ha ha, good luck.
###8 It is probably not going to happen.
###11 You could also wait until maybe Virgin Galactic finishes
###14 their project.
###16 That's going to take a long time.
###17 But wouldn't it be much more fun if you just created your
###20 own spacecraft yourself, your own space rocket, fly into
###23 space doing that?
###24 -Go.
###25 
###48 KRISTIAN VON BENGTSON: Working metal doesn't sound very sexy,
###51 but it's actually one of the best skills that I've obtained
###56 through life, except sketching and drawing.
###58 I mean, creating anything in metal is just--
###62 there's no limits to what you can actually do
###64 if you have an idea.
###67 And of course, wood is nice, but you're not going to go far
###71 in a space rocket made of wood.
###75 Yeah, my name is Kristian von Bengtson.
###76 I'm a co-founder of Copenhagen Suborbitals, a non-profit and
###82 open-source DIY space program.
###86 We're not doing open-source space flights at the moment.
###90 We're not aiming for it right now.
###91 We're doing suborbital space flight.
###92 That's a parabolic flight where you go up and down, a
###96 short trip.
###97 
###101 Copenhagen Suborbitals was founded in 2008 by myself and
###106 my partner, Peter Madsen.
###108 I was back in Denmark after I've been working at NASA
###112 Johnson Space Center.
###113 And at that time, I read in an article that Peter was
###118 launching his first and last submarine nautilus.
###123 And in that article, I read that Peter had a prior history
###128 doing rocket engines, and he wanted to work again with
###132 rocket engines.
###134 So I thought to myself, let me talk to Peter.
###140 And I contacted him, and we met in his submarine.
###143 And basically, within a few hours, we
###145 decided to join forces.
###148 He would be creating the launch vehicles.
###150 I would be creating the space capsules.
###153 And from that moment, actually, Copenhagen
###155 Suborbitals was founded.
###156 
###163 PETER MADSEN: My name is Peter Madsen.
###165 I'm with Copenhagen Suborbitals.
###167 My part of it is the rocket engines that propel the
###171 spacecraft.
###172 And it's also the construction of launch pads and all the
###176 systems, essentially, that takes the spacecraft from
###179 planet Earth and into Space.
###181 
###190 Well, I'm not obsessed.
###192 Not at all.
###193 It's all the other people who are obsessed with footballs
###197 and that sort of thing.
###198 I'm just doing what I've always been doing.
###201 I'm playing.
###202 
###210 -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###211 
###214 PETER MADSEN: This is the TM65 rocket engine.
###219 It uses two components for its propellants.
###223 The one is liquid oxygen.
###227 And the other is alcohol, the same type of
###230 alcohol that we drink.
###231 But this is just slightly more concentrated.
###234 So it's a schnapps locks engine.
###237 
###243 This engine really works the same way as the engines that
###248 originally propelled the Saturn V Rocket to the moon.
###251 It's the same type of technology.
###254 The difference from the Space Shuttle main engines to this
###257 one is that while a shuttle engine consists of literally
###263 tens of thousands of components, this one is a
###266 couple of hundred components.
###268 All the parts that this engine is consisting of--
###271 primarily the valves, the actuator, the nuts and bolts,
###274 the tubes and pipes and everything--
###276 are all the products of modern industry, and they're all off
###279 the shelf things.
###281 If it wasn't used in this rocket engine, very likely
###283 this component would have found its way into an ordinary
###287 house for heating purposes or the water
###291 mains used in a kitchen.
###293 It's the sort of things that are completely normal that we
###296 put together and turn into a rocket engine.
###300 KRISTIAN VON BENGTSON: Using off the shelf products that
###302 you can buy in vast numbers are actually
###304 very reliable systems.
###306 Instead of trying to invent our own valve, for instance,
###310 why not buy one that's been produced
###312 maybe a million times?
###316 When you're working a DIY project, the natural premise
###320 is that you don't have much.
###322 You don't have much money, funding.
###324 You don't have, maybe, all the technology like the pro guys,
###328 or the materials.
###328 And then you have to come up with solutions.
###331 And that sparks a lot of new technology, new ideas.
###336 And sometimes it also takes the solution that you would
###343 normally do--
###346 very expensive, very complex in the professional world--
###349 and bring it down to a level and show people that it's
###352 actually possible to do the same--
###354 come up with same solution for less money.
###359 The first rocket we tried to launch, it contained a hair
###363 dryer to keep one of the valves heated up so it
###369 wouldn't freeze up.
###371 It was actually a great solution.
###372 
###384 PETER MADSEN: We have left the workshop now, and we have
###386 walked about 100 meters to one of the two test stands.
###389 And what we have is a steel gantry.
###393 And up there, a room for the the four 16 millimeter bolts
###398 that keep the engine in place.
###399 And we have a crane that we use to hoist it up there.
###402 And on top of this steel structure, we have the
###405 propellant tanks of, totally, 700 kilos of propellant that
###409 the engine consumes in about 15 seconds.
###427 [APPLAUSE]
###431 KRISTIAN VON BENGTSON: Launching rockets is actually
###434 like anything else we're doing here.
###435 It's tests of different systems.
###437 
###442 We have to prove to ourselves that we are capable of
###445 handling different technologies.
###446 -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###450 
###453 KRISTIAN VON BENGTSON: There's always certain things we are
###457 testing on.
###459 So it's all a part of the big puzzle ending up for a big
###462 rocket with a capsule on top.
###465 And of course, we're going to do more launches.
###467 
###476 PETER MADSEN: We are aiming for a manned mission.
###477 But of course, we are only flying the big rockets with a
###480 crash test dummy inside.
###482 We're not going to be flying any persons, any live human
###485 being, until we believe that it's fairly safe.
###490 KRISTIAN VON BENGTSON: This is is our space capsule,
###492 Beautiful Betty.
###493 And it's the first prototype of this kind of capsule-type
###497 space vehicle for one person.
###498 Most of this--
###500 the capsule--
###500 I welded myself.
###501 But I did the sign--
###503 and some of the interior welding--
###505 I did with a guy called Klaus.
###507 He's my partner in doing these capsules here.
###511 And we're also together developing the new capsule.
###513 It was tested about two months ago.
###516 It got pretty roughed up.
###518 But it's still here.
###519 And we can still do a lot of tests.
###521 And it's a foundation of all the new capsules we're going
###523 to do in the future.
###524 
###527 Well, Randy, the crash test dummy,
###530 was inside this capsule.
###532 And, well, he lost a leg.
###534 It's possible, actually, that he would have survived, only
###538 because of the direction that it hit water.
###541 But he might be in a wheelchair forever if it was a
###545 live person.
###548 Randy has been a good friend of ours.
###550 He's been flying for the last two years.
###552 So every time we have a capsule or a spaceship, he's
###555 going to be in the seat, and he's
###556 going to take the beating.
###558 That's why you have a crash test dummy.
###562 Keeping one person alive, even only for a 15 minute ride, is
###566 a big challenge.
###567 You need to create a reliable piece of confined room,
###572 confined space for one person, where you have a small seat,
###577 where you're comfortable but also work with all the
###581 acceleration from launching the rocket but also when
###584 landing on sea.
###586 This is where you're going to be, and this is where you're
###588 actually going to experience this incredible ride, where
###591 you're going to feel the rocket lifting
###593 you away from Earth.
###594 And it's going to be so fast.
###597 And eventually, you're going to see Earth
###599 turning around out here.
###600 And it's just an amazing feeling, actually, just to
###605 have those thoughts.
###608 When the US, they launched the first astronaut, Alan Shepard,
###612 the whole countdown actually stopped because the engineers
###615 suddenly became scared.
###617 They realized they had a person inside.
###621 And they weren't really prepared mentally for that.
###625 So the countdown stopped until Alan Shepard--
###627 he told them "light the candle"--
###630 his famous words.
###632 
###635 -Lift off.
###636 ALAN SHEPARD: All right, there.
###637 Lift off, and the clock has started.
###639 KRISTIAN VON BENGTSON: An organization like this--
###641 I don't know what's going to happen when everybody had a
###645 part in it, and they suddenly understand that this--
###649 what they did--
###651 if it doesn't work, it will have a fatal outcome.
###656 Or maybe it's not going to be a problem.
###658 Maybe everybody's just going to find it exhilarating.
###661 
###669 PETER MADSEN: It doesn't take much courage to climb on board
###671 a rocket and have the hatch sealed and somebody light it,
###677 because it either works or it doesn't work.
###680 And if it doesn't work, the period of time you'd have to
###682 realize that is usually very short.
###684 But it takes a lot of courage--
###687 it takes an unimaginable amount of courage--
###689 to be the ground crew, to be the commanders on the ground,
###695 to make the decision, let's launch this thing
###697 and see if it works.
###698 And Kristian is one of the few people that I've ever met who
###701 is courageous enough to do such a thing.
###705 -T-minus 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
###714 
###719 KRISTIAN VON BENGTSON: Human space flight has always had
###721 this holy grail kind of sphere around it.
###724 
###730 It's supposed to be expensive.
###732 It's supposed to be very complex.
###734 So you just completely just forget the notion or the idea
###738 let's try and build our own space rocket.
###741 People just don't want to touch it.
###742 But I hope we can inspire people that space rocket, you
###747 can actually build it yourself.
###748 
###758 If there should be some kind of legacy from what we are
###761 doing here on this DIY project, that should be
###765 showing the world that human space flight can actually be
###768 done on a completely different scale, on a completely
###772 different level, with very simple technology.
###775 You're welcome to come and join us.
###777 You're also welcome to come here with a measuring tape and
###780 your camera.
###782 Take all the pictures or download all of the images and
###785 sketches from our blog and just, you know, copy the work
###788 or go from there from what we're doing.
###790 Basically, everybody can do this if they want to do it.
