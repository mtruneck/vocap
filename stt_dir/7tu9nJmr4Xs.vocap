###13 What's the most important part of your health?
###16 What do you think?
###18 Is it eating a balanced, mostly plant-based diet,
###25 balancing your hormones, daily exercise, getting enough sleep --
###31 What do you guys think?
###33 Taking your vitamins, seeing your doctor for regular check ups?
###37 (Laughter)
###40 These things might all seem like important, even critical, factors
###45 to living a healthy life, but what if I told you
###50 that caring for your body was the least important part of your health?
###55 What do you think?
###58 I'm a physician, so if you'd told me that five years ago,
###61 that would have been total sacrilege.
###63 I mean, I spent 12 years training,
###67 because the body is supposed to be the foundation for everything in life.
###72 But what if I told you that the medical profession had it all backwards,
###77 if the body doesn't shape how we live our lives?
###83 What if the body is actually a mirror of how we live our lives?
###89 Think about it for a minute. Think about a time in your life
###92 where you weren't living the life you were supposed to be living.
###97 Maybe you were in the wrong relationship;
###100 or you were in some hostile work environment
###102 doing what you thought you should do;
###105 or you were creatively thwarted, you felt spiritually disconnected.
###111 And what if you started getting little inklings from the body,
###114 little physical symptoms?
###117 You know, the body's trying to tell you something and you ignore it,
###120 'cause you're supposed to do what you're doing.
###123 And then the body totally decompensates.
###125 Can you think about a time in your life where something like that has happened?
###128 Yeah, I see a lot of noddings.
###131 Yeah, me too. Same thing happened to me.
###134 So this is what the body does, the body is brilliant this way,
###138 the body speaks to us in whispers.
###140 And if we ignore the whispers of the body, the body starts to yell.
###145 Millions of people in this country are ignoring the whispers of the body.
###150 We are suffering from an epidemic
###153 that modern medicine has no idea what to do with.
###156 People suffering from this epidemic are fatigued,
###160 they're anxious and depressed, they toss and turn at night,
###167 they've lost their libido.
###170 They suffer from a whole variety of aches and pains,
###177 so they go to the doctor, 'cause something is wrong.
###180 And the doctor runs a whole battery of tests,
###185 and the tests all come back normal, so the patient gets diagnosed as "well".
###189 Only the patient does not feel well.
###192 So she goes to another doctor and she starts the whole process over again,
###195 because something is clearly wrong.
###197 And it is wrong, it's just not what she thinks.
###203 I used to work in a really busy managed care practice,
###206 I was seeing 40 patients a day.
###208 And I would get so freaking frustrated with these patients.
###211 They would come in and it was so obvious they were really suffering.
###215 And I'd run the tests, everything would come back normal,
###216 I'd diagnose them well, and they'd look at me like:
###219 No, I'm not well, something's wrong.
###222 And I felt so frustrated because I couldn't come up with a diagnosis.
###226 And they just wanted, please God, give me a pill.
###229 And there was no pill, there's no pill to treat it,
###232 there's no lab test to diagnose this epidemic,
###236 there's no vaccine to prevent it, no surgery to cut it out.
###240 It wasn't until years later that I realized I was suffering
###243 from the same epidemic my patients were.
###246 By the time I was 33 years old,
###249 I was your typical physician.
###250 I had succeeded in everything I ever wanted to achieve in my life, I thought.
###254 I had all the trappings of success, the ocean front house in San Diego,
###258 the vacation home, the boat, the big fat retirement account,
###262 so I could be happy one day in the future.
###267 I was twice divorced by that point.
###270 I had been diagnosed with high blood pressure.
###272 I was taking three medications that failed to control my blood pressure
###276 and I had just been diagnosed
###277 with precancerous cells of my cervix that needed surgery.
###282 Even more importantly I was so disconnected from who I was,
###288 so totally disillusioned with my job, so completely spiritually tapped out,
###297 that I didn't even know who I was any more.
###299 I'd covered myself up with a whole series of masks.
###303 I had the doctor mask, like when you put on the white coat,
###305 stand up on a pedestal, pretend you got it all together,
###308 you know it all.
###310 And I am also a professional artist, so I had the artist mask,
###313 where you've got to be, you know, dark and brooding,
###315 mysterious -- starving, that wasn't me either.
###322 And then I had gotten married a third time,
###324 you know, third time is a charm.
###325 So now I've got this dutiful wife mask I've gotta wear,
###328 where I've got to get dinner on the table
###329 and make sure that I've got the right sexy lingerie on.
###333 And then I got pregnant and all of sudden
###335 there's this huge mummy mask you're supposed to wear, right?
###338 You guys know the mummy mask.
###339 You're supposed to instantly inherit the gene
###341 that makes you capable of baking the perfect cupcake.
###347 That's where I was, wearing all those masks,
###350 when my perfect storm hit.
###354 And at this point in my life, it was January 2006,
###359 and I gave birth to my daughter by C-section,
###362 my sixteen-year-old dog died,
###365 my healthy young brother wound up in full-blown liver failure
###368 from the antibiotic Zithromax,
###370 and my beloved father passed away from a brain tumor, all in two weeks.
###377 I had just started to take a breath, when my husband,
###381 who was the stay home for my newborn,
###383 cut two fingers off his left hand with the table saw.
###391 Yeah --
###393 They say when your life falls apart, you either grow, or you grow a tumor.
###401 Fortunately for me I decided to grow, there was something in me.
###406 SARK called it my "Inner Wise Self", which I call your inner pilot light.
###413 It said, "It's time to take the masks off. It's time to stop the madness.
###420 It's time to stop doing what you should, and start doing what you feel."
###426 And in that moment I knew I had to quit my job.
###428 Now, this was a huge deal, right? I spent 12 years training to be a doctor
###433 and hundreds of thousands of dollars
###436 and we had all the trappings, you know, the house, the mortgage,
###439 all the doctor stuff, right?
###440 My husband was not employed and I had a newborn.
###444 I also had to pay a malpractice tail to buy my freedom,
###448 a six-figure malpractice tail, in case I ever got sued in the future.
###452 So I decided to do it, and God bless my husband, who said let's jump together.
###456 And I quit my job and I had to sell my house
###459 and liquidate my retirement account and move to the country;
###461 and I spent a few months painting and writing and licking my wounds.
###467 (Laughter) (Applause)
###472 It wasn't until about nine months later, everybody was like -- nine months!
###476 I'm an OB/GYN!
###478 Nine months later I realized you can quit your job but you can't quit your calling.
###481 And I had been called at a very young age, I was seven years old,
###484 to the service, the practice, the spiritual practice of medicine;
###488 and that calling hadn't gone away.
###490 I had gotten so wounded by the system that I didn't even notice it anymore;
###495 but it came back after I had rested and healed after a little while.
###500 But I knew I couldn't go back, I couldn't be seeing 40 patients a day,
###503 7,5 minutes with my patients, that wasn't why I went to medical school.
###507 So it began this quest, that turned into an almost five-year quest now,
###512 to rediscover what I loved about medicine.
###516 So that also meant I had to figure out what I hated about medicine.
###519 So I started by blaming everybody:
###521 it was the ambulance chasing malpractice attorneys;
###523 it's big pharma; it's managed care medicine;
###527 it's the insurance company's fault.
###530 Then I thought, oh no, it's the reductionist medical system,
###532 we're so, so sub-specialized, you know?
###535 I'm an OB/GYN, so I was seeing these patients that had pelvic problems.
###538 But I knew that there was something bigger than the pelvis
###542 that was causing their issues.
###544 But I hadn't been trained to really look at that.
###547 So I thought that's the problem, like you go to your doctor,
###549 your pinky finger hurts and he says, "I'm sorry, I'm a thumb doctor."
###553 (Laughter)
###556 Nobody's looking at the whole picture.
###558 So I thought integrative medicine was the answer.
###561 And so I joined an integrative medicine practice,
###564 and it was so much better; I got a whole hour with my patients.
###568 I really got to listen to my patients,
###570 we didn't accept managed care medical insurance,
###573 so it was really so much better.
###575 And then I still kept bumping up against something though,
###578 because now if you came in and you were depressed
###580 we were giving you herbs and amino acids instead of Prozac.
###583 If you had other physical symptoms --
###585 but it was still this allopathic model,
###588 where the answer was outside of you,
###589 and I had to give you something that you could take.
###592 So I thought maybe that's not the problem, maybe I need to look outside of that
###595 and find new tools for my healing toolbox.
###598 So I started working with all these complementary
###600 and alternative health care providers,
###601 whom I love, acupuncturists, naturopaths and nutritionists.
###605 And I started treating my patients with needles in their energy meridians
###609 and raw foods, and that was great.
###611 But I kept bumping up against the same thing:
###614 patients would get better from one symptom
###617 and if we didn't treat the root cause
###619 of why they had that physical symptom in first place,
###622 they just wound up getting a new symptom.
###625 So at this point I was both really frustrated and really curious,
###628 and I started down this path of trying to figure out
###631 what really makes a body healthy,
###634 and what really makes us sick.
###636 And I dug into the medical literature and spent a year researching
###640 all of the randomized controlled clinical trials out there.
###644 And I decided this is it, I'm going to figure it out,
###646 I'm going to find the answer.
###647 And I spent hours in the library, researching, reading, studying.
###652 What I found blew my frigging mind,
###656 stuff nobody ever taught me in medical school.
###659 All the things we think of as health, all the things we think matter, they do.
###664 It matters that you exercise, it matters that you eat well,
###666 it matters that you see the doctor.
###668 But nobody taught me that what really matters is healthy relationships,
###676 having a healthy professional life,
###682 expressing yourself creatively,
###687 being spiritually connected,
###695 having a healthy sex life,
###700 being healthy financially,
###704 living in a healthy environment,
###710 being mentally healthy,
###714 and of course all the things we traditionally associate with health,
###717 also matter, all the things that nurture the body.
###721 The data on this is unbelievable.
###724 Lots of it is not in the traditional journals that you read,
###729 that doctors read, a lot of its in the psychological literature,
###733 the sociological literature.
###734 But if you look deep, this is in The New England Journal of Medicine,
###737 it's in The Journal of the American Medical Association,
###740 it's coming out of Harvard and Yale and Johns Hopkins.
###743 This is real data proving that these things are just as important,
###748 if not more.
###750 I have this patient, she's a raw vegan,
###752 she runs marathons, she takes 20 supplements a day,
###755 she sleeps eight hours a night, she does everything her doctor tells her,
###758 she's got a chart this fat, and she's still got multiple health problems.
###762 So she had heard about my philosophy I had started practicing with my patients,
###766 and I have an intake form that's about 20 pages long
###769 and it asks about all those things, relationships, work life, spiritual life,
###774 creative life, sex life, all of these things that make you whole.
###777 So she came and she filled out her form and she said, "Doctor, what's my diagnosis?"
###781 And I said, "Honey, your diagnosis is you're in a freaking abusive marriage.
###785 You hate your job, you feel creatively thwarted,
###790 you're spiritually disconnected,
###793 and you haven't let go of that resentment you have against your father
###796 who molested you as a child.
###798 Your body is never gonna get well until you heal that."
###803 So if taking care of the body isn't the most important part of being healthy,
###807 what is?
###809 It's caring for the mind, caring for the heart,
###814 caring for the soul,
###818 tapping into what I call your inner pilot light.
###822 Now your pilot light is that part of you, that essence,
###824 that authentic, deep, true part of you, that spiritual, divine spark
###830 that always knows what's right for you.
###832 You're born with it, it goes with you when you die,
###835 and it always knows the truth about you and your body.
###839 It comes to you and whispers; it's your intuition;
###842 it's that beautiful part of you that is your biggest fan;
###846 the part that writes you love letters.
###849 And that is the biggest healer you can tap into,
###852 better than any medicine, better than any doctor.
###856 So based on everything that I learned, I developed a new wellness model.
###861 And it was based, not on the pie charts and pyramids
###863 that many of the wellness models I had studied were based on.
###866 I based it on the cairn.
###868 Have you guys seen these things around San Francisco?
###871 These stacks of balanced stones, I love them, I've always loved them.
###874 I'm an artist, so it appeals to me visually.
###876 But I love the interdependence. Every stone is dependent on the other;
###880 you can't just pull one stone out without the whole thing crumbling.
###884 And the stone that's most precarious is the one on top.
###887 That's the body, that's where I think of the body.
###889 The body is the stone on top.
###893 When any of the facets of what makes you whole get out of balance,
###897 the body is the first to start whispering,
###900 and the foundation stone is your inner pilot light,
###902 that true essence of you, that vulnerable, transparent part of you.
###907 So based on that, I created this model, that I call the whole health cairn.
###913 And this is what my next book is about.
###915 An it's taking all of the facets of what makes you whole;
###919 it's about self-healing from the core, and once you recognize this,
###924 then you have all the tools you need to start your own healing journey.
###929 So all of the facets of what makes you whole are surrounded
###932 by what I call the healing bubble.
###934 This is love and gratitude and pleasure.
###937 And science proves that all of those things
###940 are good for your health as well; they are the glue that hold everything together.
###945 So I challenge you. If you have any physical symptom,
###950 if you're suffering from the epidemic that plagues the developed world,
###954 I want you to ask yourself, "What's the real reason I'm sick
###958 or suffering, what's out of balance in my whole health cairn?"
###965 What's the real diagnosis and what can you do about it?
###971 How can you be more transparent?
###973 How can you open yourself up to more possibility?
###977 How can you be more honest with yourself about what you need and who you are?
###982 If any of you were lucky enough to see Brene Brown's awesome TEDTalk
###984 about the power of vulnerability --
###987 I feel a lot of nodding heads, I love it --
###990 it's so fabulous, but it talks about the science behind being true,
###994 being vulnerable, being transparent.
###997 It generates love and intimacy which increases oxytocin and endorphins,
###1001 and reduces harmful stress hormones like cortisol and adrenalin.
###1006 When we let our true self be seen, when we let our inner pilot light radiate,
###1011 we heal from the inside out
###1013 and it's more powerful than anything medicine can give you from the outside.
###1017 So I challenge you to write the prescription for yourself.
###1021 No doctor can do this for you. We can give you drugs,
###1023 we can give you surgery, and sometimes you need that,
###1026 that's the jump-start of the self-healing process.
###1030 But to heal to the core, so that you don't develop new symptoms,
###1034 so you don't need another surgery -- you gotta write your own prescription.
###1038 So I ask you, "What is it that you need, what does your body need to get healthy?
###1046 What is it that you need to change, What needs to be tweaked in your life?"
###1052 If you knew that stripping off all of your masks
###1054 and letting us see that beautiful light within you,
###1057 was the solution to your health problems, would you be willing to do it?
###1061 I dare you.
###1064 It just might make your body right for miracles.
###1068 Thank you.
###1069 (Applause)
