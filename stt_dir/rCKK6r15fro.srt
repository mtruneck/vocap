1
0:0:12,74 --> 0:0:15,219
Professor Paul Bloom:
I actually want to begin by


2
0:0:15,219 --> 0:0:17,79
going back to Freud and hitting
a couple of loose ends.


3
0:0:17,79 --> 0:0:21,651
There was a point in my lecture
on Wednesday where I skipped


4
0:0:21,651 --> 0:0:24,494
over some parts.
I said, "We don't have time for


5
0:0:24,494 --> 0:0:26,32
this" and I just whipped past
it.


6
0:0:26,32 --> 0:0:28,3
And I couldn't sleep over the
weekend.


7
0:0:28,3 --> 0:0:31,844
I've been tormented.
I shouldn't have skipped that


8
0:0:31,844 --> 0:0:35,18
and I want to hit--Let me tell
you why I skipped it.


9
0:0:35,18 --> 0:0:39,93
The discussion I skipped was
the discussion of why we would


10
0:0:39,93 --> 0:0:42,866
have an unconscious at all.
So, I was talking about the


11
0:0:42,866 --> 0:0:46,834
scientifically respectable ideas
of Freud and I want to talk


12
0:0:46,834 --> 0:0:51,14
about some new ideas about why
there could be an unconscious.


13
0:0:51,14 --> 0:0:55,477
Now, the reason why I skipped
it is I'm not sure this is the


14
0:0:55,477 --> 0:0:58,5
best way to look at the
question.


15
0:0:58,5 --> 0:1:2,778
As we will learn throughout the
course, by far the vast majority


16
0:1:2,778 --> 0:1:6,415
of what our brains do,
the vast majority of what our


17
0:1:6,415 --> 0:1:9,579
minds do, is unconscious and
we're unaware of it.


18
0:1:9,579 --> 0:1:13,932
So the right question to ask
may not be, "Why are some things


19
0:1:13,932 --> 0:1:17,82
unconscious?"
but rather, why is this tiny


20
0:1:17,82 --> 0:1:20,47
subset of mental life--why is
this conscious?


21
0:1:20,47 --> 0:1:23,682
On the other hand,
these claims about the utility


22
0:1:23,682 --> 0:1:26,829
of unconsciousness,
I think, are provocative and


23
0:1:26,829 --> 0:1:29,503
interesting.
So I just wanted to quickly


24
0:1:29,503 --> 0:1:32,52
share them with you.
So, the question is,


25
0:1:32,52 --> 0:1:34,982
from an evolutionary
standpoint, "Why would an


26
0:1:34,982 --> 0:1:38,645
unconscious evolve?"
And an answer that some


27
0:1:38,645 --> 0:1:43,73
psychologists and biologists
have given is deception.


28
0:1:43,73 --> 0:1:46,9
So, most animals do some
deception.


29
0:1:46,9 --> 0:1:50,314
And deception defined broadly
is simply to act or be in some


30
0:1:50,314 --> 0:1:53,894
way that fools others into
believing or thinking or


31
0:1:53,894 --> 0:1:56,83
responding to something that's
false.


32
0:1:56,83 --> 0:2:0,68
There's physical examples of
deception.


33
0:2:0,68 --> 0:2:3,425
When threatened,
chimpanzees--their hair stands


34
0:2:3,425 --> 0:2:6,886
up on end and that makes them
look bigger to fool others to


35
0:2:6,886 --> 0:2:9,87
thinking they're more dangerous
than they are.


36
0:2:9,87 --> 0:2:13,217
There's an angler fish at the
bottom of the ocean that has a


37
0:2:13,217 --> 0:2:16,735
rod sticking up from the top of
its head with a lure to capture


38
0:2:16,735 --> 0:2:20,196
other fish – to fool them in
thinking that this is something


39
0:2:20,196 --> 0:2:22,919
edible and then to themselves be
devoured.


40
0:2:22,919 --> 0:2:27,99
But humans, primates in general
but particularly humans,


41
0:2:27,99 --> 0:2:32,114
are masters of deception.
We use our minds and our


42
0:2:32,114 --> 0:2:35,657
behaviors and our actions
continually to try to trick


43
0:2:35,657 --> 0:2:38,449
people into believing what's not
true.


44
0:2:38,449 --> 0:2:40,858
We try to trick people,
for instance,


45
0:2:40,858 --> 0:2:43,87
into believing that we're
tougher, smarter,


46
0:2:43,87 --> 0:2:48,126
sexier, more reliable,
more trustworthy and so on,


47
0:2:48,126 --> 0:2:51,368
than we really are.
And a large part of social


48
0:2:51,368 --> 0:2:54,588
psychology concerns the way in
which we present ourselves to


49
0:2:54,588 --> 0:2:57,808
other people so as to make the
maximally positive impression


50
0:2:57,808 --> 0:3:0,99
even when that impression isn't
true.


51
0:3:0,99 --> 0:3:5,331
At the same time,
though, we've also evolved very


52
0:3:5,331 --> 0:3:9,875
good lie detection mechanisms.
So not only is there


53
0:3:9,875 --> 0:3:13,94
evolutionary pressure for me to
lie to you, for me to persuade


54
0:3:13,94 --> 0:3:15,6
you for instance,
that if we're going to have


55
0:3:15,6 --> 0:3:18,18
a--if you are threatening me
don't threaten me,


56
0:3:18,18 --> 0:3:21,83
I am not the sort of man you
could screw around with.


57
0:3:21,83 --> 0:3:24,363
But there's evolutionary
pressure for you to look and


58
0:3:24,363 --> 0:3:25,938
say, "No.
You are the sort of man you


59
0:3:25,938 --> 0:3:27,939
could screw around with.
I can tell."


60
0:3:27,939 --> 0:3:31,53
So how do you become a good
liar?


61
0:3:31,53 --> 0:3:34,729
And here's where the
unconscious comes in.


62
0:3:34,729 --> 0:3:38,794
The hypothesis is:
the best lies are lies we tell


63
0:3:38,794 --> 0:3:41,827
ourselves.
You're a better liar,


64
0:3:41,827 --> 0:3:45,861
more generally,
if you believe the lie that


65
0:3:45,861 --> 0:3:50,43
you're telling.
This could be illustrated with


66
0:3:50,43 --> 0:3:54,478
a story about Alfred Hitchcock.
The story goes--He hated


67
0:3:54,478 --> 0:3:58,39
working with child actors but he
often had to.


68
0:3:58,39 --> 0:4:2,293
And the story goes--He was
dealing with a child actor who


69
0:4:2,293 --> 0:4:5,507
simply could not cry.
And, finally frustrated,


70
0:4:5,507 --> 0:4:7,953
Hitchcock went to the actor,
leaned over,


71
0:4:7,953 --> 0:4:11,133
whispered in his ear,
"Your parents have left you and


72
0:4:11,133 --> 0:4:14,969
they're never coming back."
The kid burst into tears.


73
0:4:14,969 --> 0:4:18,435
Hitchcock said,
"Roll ‘em" and filmed the


74
0:4:18,435 --> 0:4:20,101
kid.
And the kid,


75
0:4:20,101 --> 0:4:24,691
if you were to see him,
you'd say, "That's--Boy,


76
0:4:24,691 --> 0:4:30,16
he's--he really looks as if
he's sad" because he was.


77
0:4:30,16 --> 0:4:34,891
If I had a competition where
I'd give $100,000 to the person


78
0:4:34,891 --> 0:4:38,42
who looks the most as if they
are in pain,


79
0:4:38,42 --> 0:4:43,51
it is a very good tactic to
take a pen and jam it into your


80
0:4:43,51 --> 0:4:47,762
groin because you will look
extremely persuasively as if you


81
0:4:47,762 --> 0:4:51,182
are in pain.
If I want to persuade you that


82
0:4:51,182 --> 0:4:55,111
I love you, would never leave
you, you can trust me with


83
0:4:55,111 --> 0:4:59,54
everything, it may be a superb
tactic for me to believe it.


84
0:4:59,54 --> 0:5:5,205
And so, this account of the
evolution of the unconscious is


85
0:5:5,205 --> 0:5:8,819
that certain motivations and
goals,


86
0:5:8,819 --> 0:5:12,639
particularly sinister ones,
are better made to be


87
0:5:12,639 --> 0:5:17,652
unconscious because if a person
doesn't know they have them they


88
0:5:17,652 --> 0:5:22,325
will not give them away.
And this is something I think


89
0:5:22,325 --> 0:5:26,796
we should return to later on
when we talk about social


90
0:5:26,796 --> 0:5:30,17
interaction and social
relationships.


91
0:5:30,17 --> 0:5:34,139
One other thing on Freud--just
a story of the falsification of


92
0:5:34,139 --> 0:5:37,76
Freud.
I was taking my younger child


93
0:5:37,76 --> 0:5:42,326
home from a play date on Sunday
and he asked me out of the blue,


94
0:5:42,326 --> 0:5:46,66
"Why can't you marry your
mother or your father?"


95
0:5:46,66 --> 0:5:49,267
Now, that's actually a
difficult question to ask--to


96
0:5:49,267 --> 0:5:51,824
answer for a child,
but I tried my best to give him


97
0:5:51,824 --> 0:5:55,166
an answer.
And then I said--then I thought


98
0:5:55,166 --> 0:6:0,589
back on the Freud lecture and so
I asked him, "If you could marry


99
0:6:0,589 --> 0:6:3,81
anybody you want,
who would it be?"


100
0:6:3,81 --> 0:6:7,383
imagining he'd make explicit
the Oedipal complex and name his


101
0:6:7,383 --> 0:6:13,948
mother.
Instead, he paused for a moment


102
0:6:13,948 --> 0:6:23,476
and said, "I would marry a
donkey and a big bag of


103
0:6:23,476 --> 0:6:26,351
peanuts."
[laughter]


104
0:6:26,351 --> 0:6:29,167
Both his parents are
psychologists and he hates these


105
0:6:29,167 --> 0:6:32,2
questions and at times he just
screws around with us.


106
0:6:32,2 --> 0:6:40,821
[laughter] Okay.
Last class I started with Freud


107
0:6:40,821 --> 0:6:44,29
and now I want to turn to
Skinner.


108
0:6:44,29 --> 0:6:47,189
And the story of Skinner and
science is somewhat different


109
0:6:47,189 --> 0:6:51,499
from the story of Freud.
Freud developed and championed


110
0:6:51,499 --> 0:6:55,42
the theory of psychoanalysis by
himself.


111
0:6:55,42 --> 0:6:59,109
It is as close as you could
find in science to a solitary


112
0:6:59,109 --> 0:7:1,757
invention.
Obviously, he drew upon all


113
0:7:1,757 --> 0:7:5,265
sorts of sources and
predecessors but psychoanalysis


114
0:7:5,265 --> 0:7:7,81
is identified as Freud's
creation.


115
0:7:7,81 --> 0:7:11,875
Behaviorism is different.
Behaviorism is a school of


116
0:7:11,875 --> 0:7:15,358
thought that was there long
before Skinner,


117
0:7:15,358 --> 0:7:19,7
championed by psychologists
like John Watson,


118
0:7:19,7 --> 0:7:22,332
for instance.
Skinner came a bit late into


119
0:7:22,332 --> 0:7:26,323
this but the reason why we've
heard of Skinner and why Skinner


120
0:7:26,323 --> 0:7:29,53
is so well known is he packaged
these notions.


121
0:7:29,53 --> 0:7:32,0
He expanded upon them;
he publicized them;


122
0:7:32,0 --> 0:7:35,31
he developed them
scientifically and presented


123
0:7:35,31 --> 0:7:38,737
them both to the scientific
community and to the popular


124
0:7:38,737 --> 0:7:42,509
community and sociologically in
the 1960s and 1970s.


125
0:7:42,509 --> 0:7:45,208
In the United States,
behaviorism was incredibly well


126
0:7:45,208 --> 0:7:48,516
known and so was Skinner.
He was the sort of person you


127
0:7:48,516 --> 0:7:52,69
would see on talk shows.
His books were bestsellers.


128
0:7:52,69 --> 0:7:59,774
Now, at the core of behaviorism
are three extremely radical and


129
0:7:59,774 --> 0:8:4,966
interesting views.
The first is a strong emphasis


130
0:8:4,966 --> 0:8:8,671
on learning.
The strong view of behaviorism


131
0:8:8,671 --> 0:8:12,214
is everything you know,
everything you are,


132
0:8:12,214 --> 0:8:17,36
is the result of experience.
There's no real human nature.


133
0:8:17,36 --> 0:8:21,89
Rather, people are infinitely
malleable.


134
0:8:21,89 --> 0:8:25,348
There's a wonderful quote from
John Watson and in this quote


135
0:8:25,348 --> 0:8:29,68
John Watson is paraphrasing a
famous boast by the Jesuits.


136
0:8:29,68 --> 0:8:34,529
The Jesuits used to claim,
"Give me a child until the age


137
0:8:34,529 --> 0:8:37,82
of seven and I'll show you the
man,"


138
0:8:37,82 --> 0:8:41,576
that they would take a child
and turn him into anything they


139
0:8:41,576 --> 0:8:44,163
wanted.
And Watson expanded on this


140
0:8:44,163 --> 0:8:46,46
boast,
Give me a dozen healthy


141
0:8:46,46 --> 0:8:48,841
infants, well-formed and my own
specified world to bring them up


142
0:8:48,841 --> 0:8:51,547
and I'll guarantee to take any
one at random and train them to


143
0:8:51,547 --> 0:8:54,12
become any type of specialist I
might select--doctor,


144
0:8:54,12 --> 0:8:56,254
lawyer, artist,
merchant, chief,


145
0:8:56,254 --> 0:8:59,833
and yes, even beggar-man and
thief, regardless of his


146
0:8:59,833 --> 0:9:2,37
talents,
penchants, tendencies,


147
0:9:2,37 --> 0:9:5,419
abilities, vocations and race
of his ancestors.


148
0:9:5,419 --> 0:9:9,897
Now, you could imagine--You
could see in this a tremendous


149
0:9:9,897 --> 0:9:13,826
appeal to this view because
Watson has an extremely


150
0:9:13,826 --> 0:9:18,99
egalitarian view in a sense.
If there's no human nature,


151
0:9:18,99 --> 0:9:22,9
then there's no sense in which
one group of humans by dint of


152
0:9:22,9 --> 0:9:26,5
their race or their sex could be
better than another group.


153
0:9:26,5 --> 0:9:29,412
And Watson was explicit.
None of those facts about


154
0:9:29,412 --> 0:9:32,32
people will ever make any
difference.


155
0:9:32,32 --> 0:9:37,77
What matters to what you are is
what you learn and how you're


156
0:9:37,77 --> 0:9:40,205
treated.
And so, Watson claimed he could


157
0:9:40,205 --> 0:9:44,801
create anybody in any way simply
by treating them in a certain


158
0:9:44,801 --> 0:9:45,63
fashion.


159
0:9:45,63 --> 0:9:49,23



160
0:9:49,23 --> 0:9:55,419
A second aspect of behaviorism
was anti-mentalism.


161
0:9:55,419 --> 0:9:59,151
And what I mean by this is the
behaviorists were obsessed with


162
0:9:59,151 --> 0:10:1,72
the idea of doing science and
they felt,


163
0:10:1,72 --> 0:10:5,681
largely in reaction to Freud,
that claims about internal


164
0:10:5,681 --> 0:10:8,798
mental states like desires,
wishes, goals,


165
0:10:8,798 --> 0:10:11,59
emotions and so on,
are unscientific.


166
0:10:11,59 --> 0:10:15,294
These invisible,
vague things can never form the


167
0:10:15,294 --> 0:10:19,344
basis of a serious science.
And so, the behaviorist


168
0:10:19,344 --> 0:10:23,258
manifesto would then be to
develop a science without


169
0:10:23,258 --> 0:10:27,555
anything that's unobservable and
instead use notions like


170
0:10:27,555 --> 0:10:31,929
stimulus and response and
reinforcement and punishment and


171
0:10:31,929 --> 0:10:36,84
environment that refer to real
world and tangible events.


172
0:10:36,84 --> 0:10:41,279
Finally, behaviorists believed
there were no interesting


173
0:10:41,279 --> 0:10:45,78
differences across species.
A behaviorist might admit that


174
0:10:45,78 --> 0:10:49,814
a human can do things that a rat
or pigeon couldn't but a


175
0:10:49,814 --> 0:10:52,48
behaviorist might just say,
"Look.


176
0:10:52,48 --> 0:10:55,653
Those are just general
associative powers that differ"


177
0:10:55,653 --> 0:10:58,33
or they may even deny it.
They might say,


178
0:10:58,33 --> 0:11:0,169
"Humans and rats aren't
different at all.


179
0:11:0,169 --> 0:11:3,949
It's just humans tend to live
in a richer environment than


180
0:11:3,949 --> 0:11:5,798
rats."
From that standpoint,


181
0:11:5,798 --> 0:11:8,309
from that theoretical
standpoint, comes a


182
0:11:8,309 --> 0:11:10,57
methodological approach which
is,


183
0:11:10,57 --> 0:11:15,4
if they're all the same then
you could study human learning


184
0:11:15,4 --> 0:11:19,221
by studying nonhuman animals.
And that's a lot of what they


185
0:11:19,221 --> 0:11:20,409
did.
Okay.


186
0:11:20,409 --> 0:11:24,38
I'm going to frame my
introduction--my discussion of


187
0:11:24,38 --> 0:11:29,51
behaviors in terms of the three
main learning principles that


188
0:11:29,51 --> 0:11:33,1
they argue can explain all of
human mental life,


189
0:11:33,1 --> 0:11:36,369
all of human behavior.
And then, I want to turn to


190
0:11:36,369 --> 0:11:39,282
objections to behaviorism but
these three principles are


191
0:11:39,282 --> 0:11:41,3
powerful and very interesting.


192
0:11:41,3 --> 0:11:45,89



193
0:11:45,89 --> 0:11:50,92
The first is habituation.
This is the very simplest form


194
0:11:50,92 --> 0:11:53,499
of learning.
And what this is is technically


195
0:11:53,499 --> 0:11:58,332
described as a decline in the
tendency to respond to stimuli


196
0:11:58,332 --> 0:12:2,1
that are familiar due to
repeated exposure.


197
0:12:2,1 --> 0:12:9,809
"Hey!"
"Hey!"


198
0:12:9,809 --> 0:12:16,271
The sudden noise startles but
as it--as you hear it a second


199
0:12:16,271 --> 0:12:20,572
time it startles less.
The third time is just me being


200
0:12:20,572 --> 0:12:24,415
goofy.
It's just--It's--You get used


201
0:12:24,415 --> 0:12:26,675
to things.
And this, of course,


202
0:12:26,675 --> 0:12:28,33
is common enough in everyday
life.


203
0:12:28,33 --> 0:12:34,33
We get used to the ticking of a
clock or to noise of traffic but


204
0:12:34,33 --> 0:12:40,235
it's actually a very important
form of learning because imagine


205
0:12:40,235 --> 0:12:43,683
life without it.
Imagine life where you never


206
0:12:43,683 --> 0:12:46,439
got used to anything,
where suddenly somebody steps


207
0:12:46,439 --> 0:12:48,919
forward and waves their hand and
you'd go,


208
0:12:48,919 --> 0:12:52,388
"Woah," and then they wave
their hand again and you'd go,


209
0:12:52,388 --> 0:12:54,371
"Whoah," and you
keep--[laughter]


210
0:12:54,371 --> 0:12:57,84
And there's the loud ticking of
a clock and you say,


211
0:12:57,84 --> 0:13:3,377
"Hmmm."
And that's not the way animals


212
0:13:3,377 --> 0:13:6,35
or humans work.
You get used to things.


213
0:13:6,35 --> 0:13:10,7
And it's actually critically
important to get used to things


214
0:13:10,7 --> 0:13:15,124
because it's a useful adaptive
mechanism to keep track on new


215
0:13:15,124 --> 0:13:17,981
events and objects.
It's important to notice


216
0:13:17,981 --> 0:13:20,981
something when it's new because
then you have to decide whether


217
0:13:20,981 --> 0:13:24,76
it's going to harm you,
how to deal with it,


218
0:13:24,76 --> 0:13:28,299
to attend to it,
but you can't keep on noticing


219
0:13:28,299 --> 0:13:29,671
it.
And, in fact,


220
0:13:29,671 --> 0:13:32,769
you should stop noticing it
after it's been in the


221
0:13:32,769 --> 0:13:36,419
environment for long enough.
So, this counts as learning


222
0:13:36,419 --> 0:13:38,86
because it happens through
experience.


223
0:13:38,86 --> 0:13:41,44
It's a way to learn through
experience, to change your way


224
0:13:41,44 --> 0:13:44,761
of thinking through experience.
And also, it's useful because


225
0:13:44,761 --> 0:13:50,3
harmful stimuli are noticed but
when something has shown itself


226
0:13:50,3 --> 0:13:55,159
to be part of the environment
you don't notice it anymore.


227
0:13:55,159 --> 0:13:59,5
The existence of habituation is
important for many reasons.


228
0:13:59,5 --> 0:14:3,629
One thing it's important for is
clever developmental


229
0:14:3,629 --> 0:14:7,839
psychologists have used
habituation as a way to study


230
0:14:7,839 --> 0:14:10,965
people,
creatures who can't talk like


231
0:14:10,965 --> 0:14:13,74
nonhuman animals,
and young babies.


232
0:14:13,74 --> 0:14:18,1
And when I talk on Wednesday
about developmental psychology


233
0:14:18,1 --> 0:14:22,134
I'll show different ways in
which psychologists have used


234
0:14:22,134 --> 0:14:25,889
habituation to study the minds
of young babies.


235
0:14:25,889 --> 0:14:31,649
The second sort of learning is
known as classical conditioning.


236
0:14:31,649 --> 0:14:36,146
And what this is in a very
general sense is the learning of


237
0:14:36,146 --> 0:14:40,72
an association between one
stimulus and another stimulus,


238
0:14:40,72 --> 0:14:44,626
where stimulus is a technical
term meaning events in the


239
0:14:44,626 --> 0:14:48,39
environment like a certain smell
or sound or sight.


240
0:14:48,39 --> 0:14:56,433
It was thought up by Pavlov.
This is Pavlov's famous dog and


241
0:14:56,433 --> 0:14:59,99
it's an example of scientific
serendipity.


242
0:14:59,99 --> 0:15:4,903
Pavlov, when he started this
research, had no interest at all


243
0:15:4,903 --> 0:15:8,389
in learning.
He was interested in saliva.


244
0:15:8,389 --> 0:15:11,75
And to get saliva he had to
have dogs.


245
0:15:11,75 --> 0:15:15,224
And he had to attach something
to dogs so that their saliva


246
0:15:15,224 --> 0:15:17,74
would pour out so he could study
saliva.


247
0:15:17,74 --> 0:15:22,24
No idea why he wanted to study
saliva, but he then discovered


248
0:15:22,24 --> 0:15:24,798
something.
What he would do is he'd put


249
0:15:24,798 --> 0:15:27,82
food powder in the dog's mouth
to generate saliva.


250
0:15:27,82 --> 0:15:33,21
But Pavlov observed that when
somebody entered the room who


251
0:15:33,21 --> 0:15:36,649
typically gave him the food
powder,


252
0:15:36,649 --> 0:15:39,47
the dog--the food powder saliva
would start to come out.


253
0:15:39,47 --> 0:15:44,568
And later on if you--right
before or right during you give


254
0:15:44,568 --> 0:15:50,293
the dog some food – you ping a
bell – the bell will cause the


255
0:15:50,293 --> 0:15:53,353
saliva to come forth.
And, in fact,


256
0:15:53,353 --> 0:15:56,71
this is the apparatus that he
used for his research.


257
0:15:56,71 --> 0:16:0,299



258
0:16:0,299 --> 0:16:5,391
He developed the theory of
classical conditioning by making


259
0:16:5,391 --> 0:16:9,779
a distinction between two sorts
of conditioning,


260
0:16:9,779 --> 0:16:13,72
two sorts of stimulus response
relationships.


261
0:16:13,72 --> 0:16:17,245
One is unconditioned.
An unconditioned is when an


262
0:16:17,245 --> 0:16:19,857
unconditioned stimulus gives
rise to an unconditioned


263
0:16:19,857 --> 0:16:22,518
response.
And this is what you start off


264
0:16:22,518 --> 0:16:25,88
with.
So, if somebody pokes you with


265
0:16:25,88 --> 0:16:28,47
a stick and you say,
"Ouch," because it hurts,


266
0:16:28,47 --> 0:16:31,718
the poking and the "ouch" is an
unconditioned stimulus causing


267
0:16:31,718 --> 0:16:35,379
an unconditioned response.
You didn't have to learn that.


268
0:16:35,379 --> 0:16:39,253
When Pavlov put food powder in
the dog's mouth and saliva was


269
0:16:39,253 --> 0:16:42,416
generated, that's an
unconditioned stimulus giving


270
0:16:42,416 --> 0:16:44,87
rise to an unconditioned
response.


271
0:16:44,87 --> 0:16:48,507
But what happens through
learning is that another


272
0:16:48,507 --> 0:16:53,129
association develops – that
between the conditioned stimulus


273
0:16:53,129 --> 0:16:56,476
and the conditioned response.
So when Pavlov,


274
0:16:56,476 --> 0:16:58,225
for instance--Well,
when Pavlov,


275
0:16:58,225 --> 0:17:0,481
for instance,
started before conditioning


276
0:17:0,481 --> 0:17:3,19
there was simply an
unconditioned stimulus,


277
0:17:3,19 --> 0:17:6,156
the food in the mouth,
and an unconditioned response,


278
0:17:6,156 --> 0:17:7,96
saliva.
The bell was nothing.


279
0:17:7,96 --> 0:17:12,7
The bell was a neutral stimulus.
But over and over again,


280
0:17:12,7 --> 0:17:16,5
if you put the bell and the
food together,


281
0:17:16,5 --> 0:17:20,42
pretty soon the bell will
generate saliva.


282
0:17:20,42 --> 0:17:24,16
And now the bell--When--You
start off with the unconditioned


283
0:17:24,16 --> 0:17:26,38
stimulus, unconditioned
response.


284
0:17:26,38 --> 0:17:29,85
When the conditioned stimulus
and the unconditioned stimulus


285
0:17:29,85 --> 0:17:32,91
are brought together over and
over and over again,


286
0:17:32,91 --> 0:17:36,752
pretty soon the conditioned
stimulus gives rise to the


287
0:17:36,752 --> 0:17:39,377
response.
And now it's known as the


288
0:17:39,377 --> 0:17:43,91
conditioned stimulus giving rise
to the conditioned response.


289
0:17:43,91 --> 0:17:46,46
This is discussed in detail in
the textbook but I also--I'm


290
0:17:46,46 --> 0:17:49,23
going to give you--Don't panic
if you don't get it quite now.


291
0:17:49,23 --> 0:17:52,329
I'm going to give you further
and further examples.


292
0:17:52,329 --> 0:17:55,86
So, the idea here is,
repeated pairings of the


293
0:17:55,86 --> 0:18:0,568
unconditioned stimulus and the
conditioned stimulus will give


294
0:18:0,568 --> 0:18:3,95
rise to the response.
And there's a difference


295
0:18:3,95 --> 0:18:6,97
between reinforced trials and
unreinforced trials.


296
0:18:6,97 --> 0:18:9,943
A reinforced trial is when the
conditioned stimulus and the


297
0:18:9,943 --> 0:18:11,839
unconditioned stimulus go
together.


298
0:18:11,839 --> 0:18:16,25
You're--and to put it in a
crude way, you're teaching the


299
0:18:16,25 --> 0:18:18,94
dog that the bell goes with the
food.


300
0:18:18,94 --> 0:18:25,566
An unreinforced trial is when
you get the food without the


301
0:18:25,566 --> 0:18:27,942
bell.
You're not teaching the dog


302
0:18:27,942 --> 0:18:29,25
this.
And, in fact,


303
0:18:29,25 --> 0:18:32,191
once you teach an animal
something, if you stop doing the


304
0:18:32,191 --> 0:18:35,98
teaching the response goes away
and this is known as extinction.


305
0:18:35,98 --> 0:18:40,456
But here's a graph.
If you get--They really count


306
0:18:40,456 --> 0:18:43,59
the number of cubic centimeters
of saliva.


307
0:18:43,59 --> 0:18:47,671
The dog is trained so that when
the bell comes on--Actually,


308
0:18:47,671 --> 0:18:49,72
I misframed it.
I'll try again.


309
0:18:49,72 --> 0:18:54,346
When the bell comes connected
with food, there's a lot of


310
0:18:54,346 --> 0:18:56,733
saliva.
An unreinforced response is


311
0:18:56,733 --> 0:18:59,349
when the bell goes on but
there's no food.


312
0:18:59,349 --> 0:19:2,4
So, it's--Imagine you're the
dog.


313
0:19:2,4 --> 0:19:6,47
So, you get food in your mouth,
"bell, food,


314
0:19:6,47 --> 0:19:12,958
bell, food," and now "bell."
But next you get "bell,


315
0:19:12,958 --> 0:19:15,96
bell, bell."
You give it up.


316
0:19:15,96 --> 0:19:21,819
You stop.
You stop responding to the bell.


317
0:19:21,819 --> 0:19:25,416
A weird thing which is
discussed in the textbook is if


318
0:19:25,416 --> 0:19:29,556
you wait a while and then you
try it again with the bell after


319
0:19:29,556 --> 0:19:33,79
a couple of hours,
the saliva comes back.


320
0:19:33,79 --> 0:19:36,539
This is known as spontaneous
recovery.


321
0:19:36,539 --> 0:19:41,461
So, this all seems a very
technical phenomena related to


322
0:19:41,461 --> 0:19:46,741
animals and the like but it's
easy to see how it generalizes


323
0:19:46,741 --> 0:19:50,682
and how it extends.
One interesting notion is that


324
0:19:50,682 --> 0:19:54,53
of stimulus generalization.
And stimulus generalization is


325
0:19:54,53 --> 0:19:57,944
the topic of one of your
articles in The Norton


326
0:19:57,944 --> 0:20:0,125
Reader,
the one by Watson,


327
0:20:0,125 --> 0:20:2,468
John Watson,
the famous behaviorist,


328
0:20:2,468 --> 0:20:6,17
who reported a bizarre
experiment with a baby known as


329
0:20:6,17 --> 0:20:9,0
Little Albert.
And here's the idea.


330
0:20:9,0 --> 0:20:12,0
Little Albert originally liked
rats.


331
0:20:12,0 --> 0:20:14,453
In fact, I'm going to show you
a movie of Little Albert


332
0:20:14,453 --> 0:20:15,59
originally liking rats.


333
0:20:15,59 --> 0:20:18,93



334
0:20:18,93 --> 0:20:20,14
See.
He's okay.


335
0:20:20,14 --> 0:20:24,597
No problem.
Now, Watson did something


336
0:20:24,597 --> 0:20:28,346
interesting.
As Little Albert was playing


337
0:20:28,346 --> 0:20:30,603
with the rat,
"Oh, I like rats,


338
0:20:30,603 --> 0:20:34,892
oh," Watson went behind the
baby--this is the--it's in the


339
0:20:34,892 --> 0:20:38,73
chapter--and banged the metal
bar right here .


340
0:20:38,73 --> 0:20:41,52
The baby, "Aah," screamed,
started to sob.


341
0:20:41,52 --> 0:20:47,874
Okay.
What's the unconditioned


342
0:20:47,874 --> 0:20:51,25
stimulus?
Somebody.


343
0:20:51,25 --> 0:20:53,66
The loud noise,
the bar, the bang.


344
0:20:53,66 --> 0:20:56,39
What's the unconditioned
response?


345
0:20:56,39 --> 0:21:3,312
Crying, sadness, misery.
And as a result of this,


346
0:21:3,312 --> 0:21:7,64
Little Albert grew afraid of
the rat.


347
0:21:7,64 --> 0:21:13,45
So there--what would be the
conditioned stimulus?


348
0:21:13,45 --> 0:21:15,788
The rat.
What would be the conditioned


349
0:21:15,788 --> 0:21:17,1
response?
Fear.


350
0:21:17,1 --> 0:21:21,379
Excellent.
Moreover, this fear extended to


351
0:21:21,379 --> 0:21:24,774
other things.
So, this is a very weird and


352
0:21:24,774 --> 0:21:28,68
unpersuasive clip.
But the idea is--the clip is to


353
0:21:28,68 --> 0:21:31,471
make the point that the fear
will extend to a rabbit,


354
0:21:31,471 --> 0:21:33,796
a white rabbit.
So, the first part,


355
0:21:33,796 --> 0:21:36,45
Little Albert's fine with the
white rabbit.


356
0:21:36,45 --> 0:21:39,56
The second part is after he's
been conditioned and he's kind


357
0:21:39,56 --> 0:21:40,779
of freaked out with the white
rabbit.


358
0:21:40,779 --> 0:21:45,655
The problem is in the second
part they're throwing the rabbit


359
0:21:45,655 --> 0:21:47,85
at him but now he's okay.


360
0:21:47,85 --> 0:22:5,61



361
0:22:5,61 --> 0:22:8,78
[laughter] Is the mic on?
Oh.


362
0:22:8,78 --> 0:22:14,753
This is fine.
This is one of a long list of


363
0:22:14,753 --> 0:22:18,48
experiments that we can't do
anymore.


364
0:22:18,48 --> 0:22:23,652
So, classical conditioning is
more than a laboratory


365
0:22:23,652 --> 0:22:27,544
phenomena.
The findings of classical


366
0:22:27,544 --> 0:22:34,69
conditioning have been extended
and replicated in all sorts of


367
0:22:34,69 --> 0:22:40,59
animals including crabs,
fish, cockroaches and so on.


368
0:22:40,59 --> 0:22:46,592
And it's been argued to be an
extension of--it's argued to


369
0:22:46,592 --> 0:22:53,24
underlie certain interesting
aspects of human responses.


370
0:22:53,24 --> 0:22:56,769
So, I have some examples here.
One example is fear.


371
0:22:56,769 --> 0:23:1,18
So, the Little Albert idea--The
Little Albert experiment,


372
0:23:1,18 --> 0:23:5,589
provides an illustration for
how phobias could emerge.


373
0:23:5,589 --> 0:23:8,63
Some proportion of people in
this room have phobias.


374
0:23:8,63 --> 0:23:13,613
Imagine you're afraid of dogs.
Well, a possible story for


375
0:23:13,613 --> 0:23:18,16
the--for why you became afraid
of dogs is that one day a dog


376
0:23:18,16 --> 0:23:21,32
came up and he was a neutral
stimulus.


377
0:23:21,32 --> 0:23:24,779
No problem.
And all of a sudden he bit you.


378
0:23:24,779 --> 0:23:28,225
Now the pain of a bite,
being bit, and then the pain


379
0:23:28,225 --> 0:23:31,265
and fear of that is an
unconditioned stimulus,


380
0:23:31,265 --> 0:23:34,235
unconditioned response.
You're just born with that,


381
0:23:34,235 --> 0:23:36,449
"ow."
But the presence of the dog


382
0:23:36,449 --> 0:23:40,949
there is a conditioned stimulus
and so you grew to be afraid of


383
0:23:40,949 --> 0:23:43,251
dogs.
If you believe this,


384
0:23:43,251 --> 0:23:48,157
this also forms the basis for
ways for a theory of how you


385
0:23:48,157 --> 0:23:52,374
could make phobias go away.
How do you make conditioned


386
0:23:52,374 --> 0:23:55,22
stimulus, conditioned response
things go away?


387
0:23:55,22 --> 0:23:58,3
Well, what you do is you
extinguish them.


388
0:23:58,3 --> 0:24:1,878
How do you extinguish them?
Well, you show the thing that


389
0:24:1,878 --> 0:24:6,101
would cause you to have the fear
without the unconditioned


390
0:24:6,101 --> 0:24:9,15
stimulus.
Here's an illustration.


391
0:24:9,15 --> 0:24:11,799
It's a joke.
Sorry.


392
0:24:11,799 --> 0:24:15,14
He's simultaneously confronting
the fear of heights,


393
0:24:15,14 --> 0:24:18,669
snakes, and the dark because
he's trapped in that thing and


394
0:24:18,669 --> 0:24:22,1
the logic is--the logic of--the
logic is not bad.


395
0:24:22,1 --> 0:24:24,2
He's stuck in there.
Those are all the--his


396
0:24:24,2 --> 0:24:27,806
conditioned stimulus.
But nothing bad happens so his


397
0:24:27,806 --> 0:24:31,177
fear goes away.
The problem with this is while


398
0:24:31,177 --> 0:24:35,583
he's stuck in there he has this
screaming, horrific panic attack


399
0:24:35,583 --> 0:24:38,45
and then it makes his fear much
worse.


400
0:24:38,45 --> 0:24:41,658
So, what they do now though,
and we'll talk about this much


401
0:24:41,658 --> 0:24:45,87
later in the course when we talk
about clinical psychology--but


402
0:24:45,87 --> 0:24:47,299
one cure for phobias does draw
upon,


403
0:24:47,299 --> 0:24:50,89
in a more intelligent way,
the behaviorist literature.


404
0:24:50,89 --> 0:24:55,578
So, the claim about a phobia is
that there's a bad association


405
0:24:55,578 --> 0:24:59,881
between, say dog and fear,
or between airplanes or snakes


406
0:24:59,881 --> 0:25:3,6
and some bad response.
So, what they do is what's


407
0:25:3,6 --> 0:25:6,909
called, "systematic
desensitization," which is they


408
0:25:6,909 --> 0:25:10,813
expose you to what causes you
the fear but they relax you at


409
0:25:10,813 --> 0:25:14,916
the same time so you replace the
aversive classical conditioned


410
0:25:14,916 --> 0:25:17,63
fear with something more
positive.


411
0:25:17,63 --> 0:25:20,29
Traditionally,
they used to teach people


412
0:25:20,29 --> 0:25:23,289
relaxation exercises but that
proves too difficult.


413
0:25:23,289 --> 0:25:26,609
So nowadays they just pump you
full of some drug to get you


414
0:25:26,609 --> 0:25:29,871
really happy and so you're
really stoned out of your head,


415
0:25:29,871 --> 0:25:34,9
you're and this isn't so bad.
It's more complicated than that


416
0:25:34,9 --> 0:25:38,364
but the notion is you can use
these associative tools perhaps


417
0:25:38,364 --> 0:25:41,5
to deal with questions about
fear,


418
0:25:41,5 --> 0:25:48,95
phobias and how they go away.
Hunger.


419
0:25:48,95 --> 0:25:53,89
We'll spend some time in this
course discussing why we eat and


420
0:25:53,89 --> 0:25:55,396
when we eat.
And one answer to why we eat


421
0:25:55,396 --> 0:25:58,45
and when we eat is that there's
cues in the environment that are


422
0:25:58,45 --> 0:26:2,579
associated with eating.
And these cues generate hunger.


423
0:26:2,579 --> 0:26:5,787
For those of you who are trying
to quit smoking,


424
0:26:5,787 --> 0:26:9,268
you'll notice that there's
time--or to quit drinking


425
0:26:9,268 --> 0:26:13,158
there's times of the day or
certain activities that really


426
0:26:13,158 --> 0:26:17,39
make you want to smoke or really
make you want to drink.


427
0:26:17,39 --> 0:26:21,746
And from a behaviorist point of
view this is because of the


428
0:26:21,746 --> 0:26:24,599
associative history of these
things.


429
0:26:24,599 --> 0:26:29,211
More speculatively,
classical conditioning has been


430
0:26:29,211 --> 0:26:34,468
argued to be implicated in the
formation of sexual desire,


431
0:26:34,468 --> 0:26:38,569
including fetishes.
So a behaviorist story about


432
0:26:38,569 --> 0:26:41,821
fetishes, for instance,
is it's straightforward


433
0:26:41,821 --> 0:26:46,71
classical conditioning.
Just as your lover's caress


434
0:26:46,71 --> 0:26:52,586
brings you to orgasm,
your eyes happen to fall upon a


435
0:26:52,586 --> 0:26:55,369
shoe.
Through the simple tools of


436
0:26:55,369 --> 0:26:59,407
classical conditioning then,
the shoe becomes a conditioned


437
0:26:59,407 --> 0:27:3,375
stimulus giving rise to the
conditioned response of sexual


438
0:27:3,375 --> 0:27:6,304
pleasure.
This almost certainly is not


439
0:27:6,304 --> 0:27:9,444
the right story but again,
just as in phobias,


440
0:27:9,444 --> 0:27:13,213
some ideas of classical
conditioning may play some role


441
0:27:13,213 --> 0:27:17,75
in determining what we like and
what we don't like sexually.


442
0:27:17,75 --> 0:27:20,884
And in fact,
one treatment for pedophiles


443
0:27:20,884 --> 0:27:25,82
and rapists involved controlled
fantasies during masturbation to


444
0:27:25,82 --> 0:27:30,13
shift the association from
domination and violence,


445
0:27:30,13 --> 0:27:33,343
for instance,
to develop more positive


446
0:27:33,343 --> 0:27:36,47
associations with sexual
pleasure.


447
0:27:36,47 --> 0:27:39,906
So the strong classical
conditioning stories about


448
0:27:39,906 --> 0:27:44,43
fetishes and fears sound silly
and extreme and they probably


449
0:27:44,43 --> 0:27:47,76
are but at the same time
classical conditioning can be


450
0:27:47,76 --> 0:27:51,757
used at least to shape the focus
of our desires and of our


451
0:27:51,757 --> 0:27:54,686
interests.
Final thought actually is--Oh,


452
0:27:54,686 --> 0:27:55,759
yeah.
Okay.


453
0:27:55,759 --> 0:27:58,39
So, what do we think about
classical conditioning?


454
0:27:58,39 --> 0:28:0,39
We talked about what
habituation is for.


455
0:28:0,39 --> 0:28:1,71
What's classical conditioning
for?


456
0:28:1,71 --> 0:28:4,23
Well, the traditional view is
it's not for anything.


457
0:28:4,23 --> 0:28:7,517
It's just association.
So, what happens is the UCS and


458
0:28:7,517 --> 0:28:11,488
the CS, the bell and the food,
go together because they happen


459
0:28:11,488 --> 0:28:14,912
at the same time.
And so classical conditioning


460
0:28:14,912 --> 0:28:19,156
should be the strongest when
these two are simultaneous and


461
0:28:19,156 --> 0:28:23,839
the response to one is the same
as the response to the other.


462
0:28:23,839 --> 0:28:27,42
This is actually no longer the
mainstream view.


463
0:28:27,42 --> 0:28:29,75
The mainstream view is now a
little bit more interesting.


464
0:28:29,75 --> 0:28:33,257
It's that what happens in
classical conditioning is


465
0:28:33,257 --> 0:28:36,46
preparation.
What happens is you become


466
0:28:36,46 --> 0:28:41,499
sensitive to a cue that an event
is about to happen and that


467
0:28:41,499 --> 0:28:44,83
allows you to prepare for the
event.


468
0:28:44,83 --> 0:28:48,795
This makes certain predictions.
It predicts that the best


469
0:28:48,795 --> 0:28:52,279
timing is when the conditioned
stimulus, which is the signal,


470
0:28:52,279 --> 0:28:55,45
comes before the unconditioned
stimulus, which is what you have


471
0:28:55,45 --> 0:28:58,257
to prepare for.
And it says the conditioned


472
0:28:58,257 --> 0:29:2,49
response may be different from
the unconditioned response.


473
0:29:2,49 --> 0:29:6,388
So, move away from food.
Imagine a child who's being


474
0:29:6,388 --> 0:29:10,331
beaten by his father.
And when his father raises his


475
0:29:10,331 --> 0:29:13,49
hand he flinches.
Well, that's classical


476
0:29:13,49 --> 0:29:16,67
conditioning.
What happened in that case is


477
0:29:16,67 --> 0:29:20,799
he has learned that the raising
of a hand is a signal that he is


478
0:29:20,799 --> 0:29:24,779
about to be hit and so he
responds to that signal.


479
0:29:24,779 --> 0:29:29,24
His flinch is not the same
response that one would give if


480
0:29:29,24 --> 0:29:31,75
one's hit.
If you're hit, you don't flinch.


481
0:29:31,75 --> 0:29:33,538
If you're hit,
you might feel pain or bounce


482
0:29:33,538 --> 0:29:36,387
back or something.
Flinching is preparation for


483
0:29:36,387 --> 0:29:38,231
being hit.
And, in general,


484
0:29:38,231 --> 0:29:41,976
the idea of what goes on in
classical conditioning is that


485
0:29:41,976 --> 0:29:44,67
the response is sort of a
preparation.


486
0:29:44,67 --> 0:29:47,589
The conditioned response is a
preparation for the


487
0:29:47,589 --> 0:29:50,836
unconditioned stimulus.
Classical conditioning shows up


488
0:29:50,836 --> 0:29:53,225
all over the place.
As a final exercise,


489
0:29:53,225 --> 0:29:56,604
and I had to think about
it--Has anybody here seen the


490
0:29:56,604 --> 0:29:59,579
movie "Clockwork Orange"?
A lot of you.


491
0:29:59,579 --> 0:30:3,989
It's kind of a shocking movie
and unpleasant and very violent


492
0:30:3,989 --> 0:30:8,325
but at its core one of the main
themes is right out of Intro


493
0:30:8,325 --> 0:30:10,589
Psych.
It's classical conditioning.


494
0:30:10,589 --> 0:30:14,523
And a main character,
who is a violent murderer and


495
0:30:14,523 --> 0:30:19,48
rapist, is brought in by some
psychologists for some therapy.


496
0:30:19,48 --> 0:30:22,359
And the therapy he gets is
classical conditioning.


497
0:30:22,359 --> 0:30:25,92
In particular,
what happens is he is given a


498
0:30:25,92 --> 0:30:28,65
drug that makes him violently
ill, extremely nauseous.


499
0:30:28,65 --> 0:30:32,214
And then his eyes are propped
open and he's shown scenes of


500
0:30:32,214 --> 0:30:34,955
violence.
As a result of this sort of


501
0:30:34,955 --> 0:30:38,322
conditioning,
he then – when he experiences


502
0:30:38,322 --> 0:30:42,99
real world violence – he
responds with nausea and shock;


503
0:30:42,99 --> 0:30:50,227
basically, training him to get
away from these acts of


504
0:30:50,227 --> 0:30:53,9
violence.
In this example--Take a moment.


505
0:30:53,9 --> 0:30:55,5
Don't say it aloud.
Just take a moment.


506
0:30:55,5 --> 0:30:59,66
What's the unconditioned
stimulus?


507
0:30:59,66 --> 0:31:1,238
Okay.
Anybody, what's the


508
0:31:1,238 --> 0:31:3,15
unconditioned stimulus?
Somebody just say it.


509
0:31:3,15 --> 0:31:8,887
The drug.
What's the unconditioned


510
0:31:8,887 --> 0:31:10,98
response?
Nausea.


511
0:31:10,98 --> 0:31:14,96
What's the conditioned stimulus?
Violence.


512
0:31:14,96 --> 0:31:19,89
What's the conditioned response?
Perfect.


513
0:31:19,89 --> 0:31:24,367
The third and final type of
learning is known as operant


514
0:31:24,367 --> 0:31:28,589
conditioning or instrumental
conditioning.


515
0:31:28,589 --> 0:31:32,981
And this is the thing,
this is the theory championed


516
0:31:32,981 --> 0:31:36,769
and developed most extensively
by Skinner.


517
0:31:36,769 --> 0:31:41,486
What this is is learning the
relationships between what you


518
0:31:41,486 --> 0:31:45,226
do and how successful or
unsuccessful they are,


519
0:31:45,226 --> 0:31:48,56
learning what works and what
doesn't.


520
0:31:48,56 --> 0:31:50,838
It's important.
This is very different from


521
0:31:50,838 --> 0:31:54,71
classical conditioning and one
way to see how this is different


522
0:31:54,71 --> 0:31:56,94
is for classical conditioning
you don't do anything.


523
0:31:56,94 --> 0:32:1,379
You could literally be strapped
down and be immobile and these


524
0:32:1,379 --> 0:32:4,799
connections are what you
appreciate and you make


525
0:32:4,799 --> 0:32:8,891
connections in your mind.
Instrumental conditioning is


526
0:32:8,891 --> 0:32:12,946
voluntary.
You choose to do things and by


527
0:32:12,946 --> 0:32:18,816
dint of your choices.
Some choices become more


528
0:32:18,816 --> 0:32:24,4
learned than others.
So, the idea itself was


529
0:32:24,4 --> 0:32:29,47
developed in the nicest form by
Thorndike who explored how


530
0:32:29,47 --> 0:32:32,755
animals learn.
Remember behaviorists were


531
0:32:32,755 --> 0:32:35,83
entirely comfortable studying
animals and drawing


532
0:32:35,83 --> 0:32:38,97
extrapolations to other animals
and to humans.


533
0:32:38,97 --> 0:32:41,95
So, he would put a cat in a
puzzle box.


534
0:32:41,95 --> 0:32:45,924
And the trick to a puzzle box
is there's a simple way to get


535
0:32:45,924 --> 0:32:48,955
out but you have to kind of pull
on something,


536
0:32:48,955 --> 0:32:51,92
some special lever,
to make it pop open.


537
0:32:51,92 --> 0:32:56,427
And Thorndike noted that cats
do not solve this problem


538
0:32:56,427 --> 0:33:0,149
through insight.
They don't sit in the box for a


539
0:33:0,149 --> 0:33:4,23
while and mull it over and then
figure out how to do it.


540
0:33:4,23 --> 0:33:7,501
Instead, what they do is they
bounce all around doing


541
0:33:7,501 --> 0:33:11,339
different things and gradually
get better and better at it.


542
0:33:11,339 --> 0:33:13,761
So, what they do is,
the first time they might


543
0:33:13,761 --> 0:33:15,914
scratch at the bars,
push at the ceiling,


544
0:33:15,914 --> 0:33:17,96
dig at the floor,
howl, etc., etc.


545
0:33:17,96 --> 0:33:20,269
And one of their behaviors is
pressing the lever.


546
0:33:20,269 --> 0:33:23,995
The lever gets them out of the
box, but after more and more


547
0:33:23,995 --> 0:33:27,656
trials they stopped scratching
at the bars, pushing at the


548
0:33:27,656 --> 0:33:31,42
ceiling and so on.
They just pressed the lever.


549
0:33:31,42 --> 0:33:34,866
And if you graph it,
they gradually get better and


550
0:33:34,866 --> 0:33:37,51
better.
They throw out all of these


551
0:33:37,51 --> 0:33:41,42
behaviors randomly.
Some of them get reinforced and


552
0:33:41,42 --> 0:33:46,26
those are the ones that survive
and others don't get reinforced


553
0:33:46,26 --> 0:33:49,539
and those are the ones that go
extinct.


554
0:33:49,539 --> 0:33:53,418
And it might occur to some of
you that this seems to be an


555
0:33:53,418 --> 0:33:57,23
analogy with the Darwinian
theory of natural selection


556
0:33:57,23 --> 0:34:0,97
where there's a random
assortment of random mutations.


557
0:34:0,97 --> 0:34:4,612
And sexual selections give rise
to a host of organisms,


558
0:34:4,612 --> 0:34:8,659
some of which survive and are
fit and others which aren't.


559
0:34:8,659 --> 0:34:12,144
And in fact,
Skinner explicitly made the


560
0:34:12,144 --> 0:34:16,701
analogy from the natural
selection of species to the


561
0:34:16,701 --> 0:34:21,965
natural selection of behavior.
So this could be summarized as


562
0:34:21,965 --> 0:34:25,526
the law of effect,
which is a tendency to perform


563
0:34:25,526 --> 0:34:30,199
– an action's increased if
rewarded, weakened if it's not.


564
0:34:30,199 --> 0:34:34,329
And Skinner extended this more
generally.


565
0:34:34,329 --> 0:34:39,643
So, to illustrate Skinnerian
theory in operant conditioning


566
0:34:39,643 --> 0:34:43,4
I'll give an example of training
a pig.


567
0:34:43,4 --> 0:34:47,699
So here is the idea.
You need to train a pig and you


568
0:34:47,699 --> 0:34:51,969
need to do so through operant
conditioning.


569
0:34:51,969 --> 0:34:55,614
So one of the things you want
to do is--The pig is going to do


570
0:34:55,614 --> 0:34:58,84
some things you like and some
things you don't like.


571
0:34:58,84 --> 0:35:3,47
And so what you want to do,
basically drawing upon the law


572
0:35:3,47 --> 0:35:8,19
of effect, is reinforce the pig
for doing good things.


573
0:35:8,19 --> 0:35:10,23
Suppose you want the pig to
walk forward.


574
0:35:10,23 --> 0:35:14,137
So, you reinforce the pig for
walking forward and you punish


575
0:35:14,137 --> 0:35:18,73
the pig for walking backward.
And if you do that over the


576
0:35:18,73 --> 0:35:20,793
fullness of time,
your reinforcement and


577
0:35:20,793 --> 0:35:24,699
punishment will give rise to a
pig who walks forward.


578
0:35:24,699 --> 0:35:28,448
There's two--One technical
distinction that people love to


579
0:35:28,448 --> 0:35:32,59
put on Intro Psych exams is that
the difference between positive


580
0:35:32,59 --> 0:35:35,55
reinforcement and negative
reinforcement.


581
0:35:35,55 --> 0:35:40,46
Reinforcement is something that
makes the behavior increase.


582
0:35:40,46 --> 0:35:44,51
Negative reinforcement is very
different from punishment.


583
0:35:44,51 --> 0:35:47,179
Negative reinforcement is just
a type of reward.


584
0:35:47,179 --> 0:35:51,329
The difference is in positive
reinforcement you do something;


585
0:35:51,329 --> 0:35:55,369
in negative reinforcement you
take away something aversive.


586
0:35:55,369 --> 0:35:59,5
So, imagine the pig has a heavy
collar and to reward the pig for


587
0:35:59,5 --> 0:36:2,909
walking forward you might remove
the heavy collar.


588
0:36:2,909 --> 0:36:7,61
So, these are the basic
techniques to train an animal.


589
0:36:7,61 --> 0:36:11,836
But it's kind of silly because
suppose you want your pig to


590
0:36:11,836 --> 0:36:14,211
dance.
You don't just want your pig to


591
0:36:14,211 --> 0:36:17,5
walk forward.
You want your pig to dance.


592
0:36:17,5 --> 0:36:21,503
Well, you can't adopt the
policy of "I'm going to wait for


593
0:36:21,503 --> 0:36:25,717
this pig to dance and when it
does I'm going to reinforce it"


594
0:36:25,717 --> 0:36:29,369
because it's going to take you a
very long time.


595
0:36:29,369 --> 0:36:33,673
Similarly, if you're dealing
with immature humans and you


596
0:36:33,673 --> 0:36:36,44
want your child to get you a
beer,


597
0:36:36,44 --> 0:36:39,806
you can't just sit,
wait for the kid to give you a


598
0:36:39,806 --> 0:36:42,28
beer and uncap the bottle and
say,


599
0:36:42,28 --> 0:36:43,51
"Excellent.
Good.


600
0:36:43,51 --> 0:36:47,996
Hugs."
You've got to work your way to


601
0:36:47,996 --> 0:36:50,406
it.
And the act of working your way


602
0:36:50,406 --> 0:36:55,671
to it is known as shaping.
So, here is how to get a pig to


603
0:36:55,671 --> 0:36:58,335
dance.
You wait for the pig to do


604
0:36:58,335 --> 0:37:2,511
something that's halfway close
to dancing, like stumbling,


605
0:37:2,511 --> 0:37:5,709
and you reward it.
Then it does something else


606
0:37:5,709 --> 0:37:8,719
that's even closer to dancing
and you reward it.


607
0:37:8,719 --> 0:37:12,389
And you keep rewarding it as it
gets closer to closer.


608
0:37:12,389 --> 0:37:16,19
Here's how to get your child to
bring you some beer.


609
0:37:16,19 --> 0:37:19,84
You say, "Johnny,
could you go to the kitchen and


610
0:37:19,84 --> 0:37:21,653
get me some beer?"
And he walks to the kitchen and


611
0:37:21,653 --> 0:37:24,3
then he forgets why he's there
and you run out there.


612
0:37:24,3 --> 0:37:25,56
"You're such a good kid.
Congratulations.


613
0:37:25,56 --> 0:37:28,631
Hugs."
And then you get him to--and


614
0:37:28,631 --> 0:37:32,453
then finally you get him to also
open up the refrigerator and get


615
0:37:32,453 --> 0:37:34,167
the beer,
open the door,


616
0:37:34,167 --> 0:37:37,942
get the--and in that way you
can train creatures to do


617
0:37:37,942 --> 0:37:41,544
complicated things.
Skinner had many examples of


618
0:37:41,544 --> 0:37:43,257
this.
Skinner developed,


619
0:37:43,257 --> 0:37:46,239
in World War II,
a pigeon guided missile.


620
0:37:46,239 --> 0:37:50,449
It was never actually used but
it was a great idea.


621
0:37:50,449 --> 0:37:54,252
And people, in fact--The
history of the military in the


622
0:37:54,252 --> 0:37:57,772
United States and other
countries includes a lot of


623
0:37:57,772 --> 0:38:1,504
attempts to get animals like
pigeons or dolphins to do


624
0:38:1,504 --> 0:38:5,8
interesting and deadly things
through various training.


625
0:38:5,8 --> 0:38:8,771
More recreational,
Skinner was fond of teaching


626
0:38:8,771 --> 0:38:11,917
animals to play Ping-Pong.
And again, you don't teach an


627
0:38:11,917 --> 0:38:14,637
animal to play Ping-Pong by
waiting for it to play Ping-Pong


628
0:38:14,637 --> 0:38:19,511
and then rewarding it.
Rather, you reward


629
0:38:19,511 --> 0:38:24,828
approximations to it.
And basically,


630
0:38:24,828 --> 0:38:28,639
there are primary reinforcers.
There are some things pigs


631
0:38:28,639 --> 0:38:31,48
naturally like,
food for instance.


632
0:38:31,48 --> 0:38:34,554
There are some things pigs
actually automatically don't


633
0:38:34,554 --> 0:38:38,159
like, like being hit or shocked.
But in the real world when


634
0:38:38,159 --> 0:38:41,113
dealing with humans,
but even when dealing with


635
0:38:41,113 --> 0:38:43,783
animals,
we don't actually always use


636
0:38:43,783 --> 0:38:46,94
primary reinforcers or negative
reinforcers.


637
0:38:46,94 --> 0:38:51,396
What we often use are things
like--for my dog saying,


638
0:38:51,396 --> 0:38:54,82
"Good dog."
Now, saying "Good dog" is not


639
0:38:54,82 --> 0:38:58,327
something your dog has been
built, pre-wired,


640
0:38:58,327 --> 0:39:2,398
to find pleasurable.
But what happens is you can do


641
0:39:2,398 --> 0:39:5,676
a two-step process.
You can make "Good dog"


642
0:39:5,676 --> 0:39:8,86
positive through classical
conditioning.


643
0:39:8,86 --> 0:39:11,929
You give the dog a treat and
say, "Good dog."


644
0:39:11,929 --> 0:39:16,3
Now the phrase "good dog" will
carry the rewarding quality.


645
0:39:16,3 --> 0:39:19,188
And you could use that
rewarding quality in order to


646
0:39:19,188 --> 0:39:21,364
train it.
And through this way


647
0:39:21,364 --> 0:39:25,624
behaviorists have developed
token economies where they get


648
0:39:25,624 --> 0:39:29,66
nonhuman animals to do
interesting things for seemingly


649
0:39:29,66 --> 0:39:32,65
arbitrary rewards like poker
chips.


650
0:39:32,65 --> 0:39:38,15
And in this way you can
increase the utility and ease of


651
0:39:38,15 --> 0:39:42,5
training.
Finally, in the examples we're


652
0:39:42,5 --> 0:39:47,608
giving, whenever the pig does
something you like you reinforce


653
0:39:47,608 --> 0:39:50,936
it.
But that's not how real life


654
0:39:50,936 --> 0:39:53,742
works.
Real life for both humans and


655
0:39:53,742 --> 0:39:58,403
animals involved cases where the
reinforcement doesn't happen all


656
0:39:58,403 --> 0:40:2,117
the time but actually happens
according to different


657
0:40:2,117 --> 0:40:4,599
schedules.
And so, there is the


658
0:40:4,599 --> 0:40:8,213
distinction between fixed
schedules versus ratios –


659
0:40:8,213 --> 0:40:11,55
variable schedules and ratio
versus interval.


660
0:40:11,55 --> 0:40:13,599
And this is something you could
print out to look at.


661
0:40:13,599 --> 0:40:15,42
I don't need to go over it in
detail.


662
0:40:15,42 --> 0:40:20,692
The difference between ratio is
a reward every certain number of


663
0:40:20,692 --> 0:40:26,102
times somebody does something.
So, if every tenth time your


664
0:40:26,102 --> 0:40:31,86
dog brought you the newspaper
you gave it hugs and treats;


665
0:40:31,86 --> 0:40:35,452
that's ratio.
An interval is over a period of


666
0:40:35,452 --> 0:40:38,177
time.
So, if your dog gives you--if


667
0:40:38,177 --> 0:40:42,253
your dog, I don't know,
dances for an hour straight,


668
0:40:42,253 --> 0:40:45,5
that would be an interval
thing.


669
0:40:45,5 --> 0:40:49,548
And fixed versus variable
speaks to whether you give a


670
0:40:49,548 --> 0:40:52,927
reward on a fixed schedule,
every fifth time,


671
0:40:52,927 --> 0:40:55,88
or variable,
sometimes on the third time,


672
0:40:55,88 --> 0:40:57,94
sometimes on the seventh time,
and so on.


673
0:40:57,94 --> 0:41:0,803
And these are--There are
examples here and there's no


674
0:41:0,803 --> 0:41:3,799
need to go over them.
It's easy enough to think of


675
0:41:3,799 --> 0:41:7,696
examples in real life.
So, for example,


676
0:41:7,696 --> 0:41:12,96
a slot machine is variable
ratio.


677
0:41:12,96 --> 0:41:16,829
It goes off after it's been hit
a certain number of times.


678
0:41:16,829 --> 0:41:19,289
It doesn't matter how long it
takes you for--to do it.


679
0:41:19,289 --> 0:41:21,659
It's the number of times you
pull it down.


680
0:41:21,659 --> 0:41:24,49
But it's variable because it
doesn't always go off on the


681
0:41:24,49 --> 0:41:26,31
thousandth time.
You don't know.


682
0:41:26,31 --> 0:41:30,609
It's unpredictable.
The slot machine is a good


683
0:41:30,609 --> 0:41:35,777
example of a phenomena known as
the partial reinforcement


684
0:41:35,777 --> 0:41:38,219
effect.
And this is kind of neat.


685
0:41:38,219 --> 0:41:42,1
It makes sense when you hear it
but it's the sort of finding


686
0:41:42,1 --> 0:41:45,849
that's been validated over and
over again with animals and


687
0:41:45,849 --> 0:41:49,179
nonhumans.
Here's the idea.


688
0:41:49,179 --> 0:41:52,808
Suppose you want to train
somebody to do something and you


689
0:41:52,808 --> 0:41:56,564
want the training such that
they'll keep on doing it even if


690
0:41:56,564 --> 0:41:58,92
you're not training them
anymore,


691
0:41:58,92 --> 0:42:1,5
which is typically what you
want.


692
0:42:1,5 --> 0:42:6,695
If you want that,
the trick is don't reinforce it


693
0:42:6,695 --> 0:42:10,244
all the time.
Behaviors last longer if


694
0:42:10,244 --> 0:42:13,961
they're reinforced
intermittently and this is known


695
0:42:13,961 --> 0:42:17,1
as "the partial reinforcement
effect."


696
0:42:17,1 --> 0:42:19,156
Thinking of this
psychologically,


697
0:42:19,156 --> 0:42:22,981
it's as if whenever you put
something in a slot machine it


698
0:42:22,981 --> 0:42:25,53
gave you money,
then all of a sudden it


699
0:42:25,53 --> 0:42:28,139
stopped.
You keep on doing it a few


700
0:42:28,139 --> 0:42:30,13
times but then you say,
"Fine.


701
0:42:30,13 --> 0:42:33,651
It doesn't work," but what if
it gave you money one out of


702
0:42:33,651 --> 0:42:37,517
every hundred times?
Now you keep on trying and


703
0:42:37,517 --> 0:42:43,304
because the reinforcement is
intermittent you don't expect it


704
0:42:43,304 --> 0:42:49,91
as much and so your behavior
will persist across often a huge


705
0:42:49,91 --> 0:42:52,559
amount of time.
Here's a good example.


706
0:42:52,559 --> 0:42:57,144
What's the very worst thing to
do when your kid cries to go


707
0:42:57,144 --> 0:43:1,807
into bed with you and you don't
want him to go into bed with


708
0:43:1,807 --> 0:43:4,411
you?
Well, one--The worst thing to


709
0:43:4,411 --> 0:43:8,15
do is for any--Actually,
for any form of discipline with


710
0:43:8,15 --> 0:43:10,87
a kid is to say,
"No, absolutely not.


711
0:43:10,87 --> 0:43:15,61
No, no, no, no."
"Okay."


712
0:43:15,61 --> 0:43:19,269
And then later on the kid's
going to say,


713
0:43:19,269 --> 0:43:24,941
"I want to do it again" and you
say no and the kid keeps asking


714
0:43:24,941 --> 0:43:28,288
because you've put it,
well, put it as in a


715
0:43:28,288 --> 0:43:30,515
psychological way,
not the way the behaviorists


716
0:43:30,515 --> 0:43:32,18
would put it.
The kid knows okay,


717
0:43:32,18 --> 0:43:34,851
he's not going to get it right
away, he's going to keep on


718
0:43:34,851 --> 0:43:36,538
asking.
And so typically,


719
0:43:36,538 --> 0:43:40,84
what you're doing inadvertently
in those situations is you're


720
0:43:40,84 --> 0:43:44,21
exploiting the partial
reinforcement effect.


721
0:43:44,21 --> 0:43:47,675
If I want my kid to do
something, I should say yes one


722
0:43:47,675 --> 0:43:50,623
out of every ten times.
Unfortunately,


723
0:43:50,623 --> 0:43:53,719
that's the evolution of
nagging.


724
0:43:53,719 --> 0:43:57,379
Because you nag,
you nag, you nag,


725
0:43:57,379 --> 0:44:1,593
the person says,
"Fine, okay," and that


726
0:44:1,593 --> 0:44:5,816
reinforces it.
If Skinner kept the focus on


727
0:44:5,816 --> 0:44:10,11
rats and pigeons and dogs,
he would not have the impact


728
0:44:10,11 --> 0:44:14,801
that he did but he argued that
you could extend all of these


729
0:44:14,801 --> 0:44:18,38
notions to humans and to human
behavior.


730
0:44:18,38 --> 0:44:21,714
So for an example,
he argued that the prison


731
0:44:21,714 --> 0:44:26,134
system needs to be reformed
because instead of focusing on


732
0:44:26,134 --> 0:44:30,321
notions of justice and
retribution what we should do is


733
0:44:30,321 --> 0:44:34,896
focus instead on questions of
reinforcing good behaviors and


734
0:44:34,896 --> 0:44:39,25
punishing bad ones.
He argued for the notions of


735
0:44:39,25 --> 0:44:43,69
operant conditioning to be
extended to everyday life and


736
0:44:43,69 --> 0:44:48,49
argued that people's lives would
become fuller and more


737
0:44:48,49 --> 0:44:51,843
satisfying if they were
controlled in a properly


738
0:44:51,843 --> 0:44:55,37
behaviorist way.
Any questions about behaviorism?


739
0:44:55,37 --> 0:45:1,679



740
0:45:1,679 --> 0:45:3,6
What are your questions about
behaviorism?


741
0:45:3,6 --> 0:45:12,54



742
0:45:12,54 --> 0:45:16,53
[laughter] Yes.
Student:


743
0:45:16,53 --> 0:45:20,21
[inaudible]--wouldn't there be
extinction after a while?


744
0:45:20,21 --> 0:45:20,89
[inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:


745
0:45:20,89 --> 0:45:23,312
Good question.
The discussion was over using


746
0:45:23,312 --> 0:45:27,523
things like poker chips for
reinforcement and the point is


747
0:45:27,523 --> 0:45:29,903
exactly right.
Since the connection with the


748
0:45:29,903 --> 0:45:32,19
poker chips is established
through classical conditioning,


749
0:45:32,19 --> 0:45:36,151
sooner or later by that logic
the poker chips would lose their


750
0:45:36,151 --> 0:45:40,684
power to serve as reinforcers.
You'd have to sort of start it


751
0:45:40,684 --> 0:45:44,453
up again, retrain again.
If you have a dog and you say


752
0:45:44,453 --> 0:45:47,1
"Good dog" to reward the dog,
by your logic,


753
0:45:47,1 --> 0:45:49,265
which is right,
at some point you might as well


754
0:45:49,265 --> 0:45:51,99
give the dog a treat along with
the "Good dog."


755
0:45:51,99 --> 0:45:53,44
Otherwise, "Good dog" is not
going to cut it anymore.


756
0:45:53,44 --> 0:45:59,17



757
0:45:59,17 --> 0:46:1,703
Yes.
Student:


758
0:46:1,703 --> 0:46:4,182
[inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:


759
0:46:4,182 --> 0:46:6,662
As far as I know,
Skinner and Skinnerian


760
0:46:6,662 --> 0:46:9,713
psychologists were never
directly involved in the


761
0:46:9,713 --> 0:46:12,465
creation of prisons.
On the other hand,


762
0:46:12,465 --> 0:46:15,514
the psychological theory of
behaviorism has had a huge


763
0:46:15,514 --> 0:46:18,85
impact and I think a lot of
people's ways of thinking about


764
0:46:18,85 --> 0:46:21,784
criminal justice and criminal
law has been shaped by


765
0:46:21,784 --> 0:46:24,606
behaviorist principles.
So for instance,


766
0:46:24,606 --> 0:46:28,238
institutions like mental
institutions and some prisons


767
0:46:28,238 --> 0:46:32,35
have installed token economies
where there's rewards for good


768
0:46:32,35 --> 0:46:34,9
behavior,
often poker chips of a sort.


769
0:46:34,9 --> 0:46:36,98
And then you could cash them in
for other things.


770
0:46:36,98 --> 0:46:40,613
And, to some extent,
these have been shaped by an


771
0:46:40,613 --> 0:46:43,49
adherence to behaviorist
principles.


772
0:46:43,49 --> 0:46:52,371
Okay.
So, here are the three general


773
0:46:52,371 --> 0:46:57,872
positions of behaviorism.
(1) That there is no innate


774
0:46:57,872 --> 0:47:0,32
knowledge.
All you need is learning.


775
0:47:0,32 --> 0:47:4,683
(2) That you could explain
human psychology without mental


776
0:47:4,683 --> 0:47:9,76
notions like desires and goals.
(3) And that these mechanisms


777
0:47:9,76 --> 0:47:12,23
apply across all domains and
across all species.


778
0:47:12,23 --> 0:47:15,309



779
0:47:15,309 --> 0:47:19,87
I think it's fair to say that
right now just about everybody


780
0:47:19,87 --> 0:47:22,159
agrees all of these three claims
are mistaken.


781
0:47:22,159 --> 0:47:28,15
First, we know that it's not
true that everything is learned.


782
0:47:28,15 --> 0:47:31,465
There is considerable evidence
for different forms of innate


783
0:47:31,465 --> 0:47:35,62
knowledge and innate desires and
we'll look--and we'll talk about


784
0:47:35,62 --> 0:47:38,97
it in detail when we look at
case studies like language


785
0:47:38,97 --> 0:47:40,655
learning,
the development of sexual


786
0:47:40,655 --> 0:47:44,155
preference, the developing
understanding of material


787
0:47:44,155 --> 0:47:46,98
objects.
There's a lot of debate over


788
0:47:46,98 --> 0:47:51,638
how much is innate and what the
character of the built-in mental


789
0:47:51,638 --> 0:47:55,779
systems are but there's nobody
who doubts nowadays that a


790
0:47:55,779 --> 0:48:0,659
considerable amount for humans
and other animals is built-in.


791
0:48:0,659 --> 0:48:4,869
Is it true that talking about
mental states is unscientific?


792
0:48:4,869 --> 0:48:9,39
Nobody believes this anymore
either.


793
0:48:9,39 --> 0:48:12,596
Science, particularly more
advanced sciences like physics


794
0:48:12,596 --> 0:48:15,389
or chemistry,
are all about unobservables.


795
0:48:15,389 --> 0:48:18,619
They're all about things you
can't see.


796
0:48:18,619 --> 0:48:23,573
And it makes sense to explain
complex and intelligent behavior


797
0:48:23,573 --> 0:48:28,69
in terms of internal mechanisms
and internal representations.


798
0:48:28,69 --> 0:48:32,902
Once again, the computer
revolution has served as an


799
0:48:32,902 --> 0:48:36,559
illustrative case study.
If you have a computer that


800
0:48:36,559 --> 0:48:39,746
plays chess and you want to
explain how the computer plays


801
0:48:39,746 --> 0:48:42,372
chess,
it's impossible to do so


802
0:48:42,372 --> 0:48:47,235
without talking about the
programs and mechanisms inside


803
0:48:47,235 --> 0:48:50,275
the computer.
Is it true that animals need


804
0:48:50,275 --> 0:48:52,539
reinforcement and punishment to
learn?


805
0:48:52,539 --> 0:48:56,1
No, and there's several
demonstrations at the time of


806
0:48:56,1 --> 0:48:58,48
Skinner suggesting that they
don't.


807
0:48:58,48 --> 0:49:4,0
This is from a classic study by
Tolman where rats were taught to


808
0:49:4,0 --> 0:49:6,785
run a maze.
And what they found was the


809
0:49:6,785 --> 0:49:9,589
rats did fine.
They learn to run a maze faster


810
0:49:9,589 --> 0:49:12,941
and faster when they're
regularly rewarded but they also


811
0:49:12,941 --> 0:49:16,658
learn to run a maze faster and
faster if they are not rewarded


812
0:49:16,658 --> 0:49:19,819
at all.
So the reward helps,


813
0:49:19,819 --> 0:49:24,8
but the reward is in no sense
necessary.


814
0:49:24,8 --> 0:49:29,59
And here's a more sophisticated
illustration of the same point.


815
0:49:29,59 --> 0:49:32,685
Professor Paul Bloom:
And this is the sort of


816
0:49:32,685 --> 0:49:36,949
finding, an old finding from
before most of you were born,


817
0:49:36,949 --> 0:49:40,94
that was a huge embarrassment
for the Skinnerian theory,


818
0:49:40,94 --> 0:49:44,639
as it suggests that rats in
fact had mental maps,


819
0:49:44,639 --> 0:49:48,848
an internal mechanism that they
used to understand the world –


820
0:49:48,848 --> 0:49:52,254
entirely contrary to the
behaviorist idea everything


821
0:49:52,254 --> 0:49:56,53
could be explained in terms of
reinforcement and punishment.


822
0:49:56,53 --> 0:49:59,854
Finally, is it true that
there's no animal-specific


823
0:49:59,854 --> 0:50:3,134
constraints for learning?
And again, the answer seems to


824
0:50:3,134 --> 0:50:5,426
be "no."
Animals, for instance,


825
0:50:5,426 --> 0:50:9,757
have natural responses.
So, you could train a pigeon to


826
0:50:9,757 --> 0:50:14,94
peck for food but that's because
pecking for food is a very


827
0:50:14,94 --> 0:50:17,929
natural response.
It's very difficult to train it


828
0:50:17,929 --> 0:50:22,12
to peck to escape a situation.
You can train it to flap its


829
0:50:22,12 --> 0:50:26,285
wings to escape a situation but
it's very difficult to get it to


830
0:50:26,285 --> 0:50:29,7
flap its wings for food.
And the idea is they have sort


831
0:50:29,7 --> 0:50:32,743
of natural responses that these
learning situations might


832
0:50:32,743 --> 0:50:35,612
exploit and might channel,
but essentially,


833
0:50:35,612 --> 0:50:39,973
they do have certain natural
ways of acting towards the


834
0:50:39,973 --> 0:50:43,454
world.
We know that not all stimuli


835
0:50:43,454 --> 0:50:49,56
and responses are created equal.
So, the Gray textbook has a


836
0:50:49,56 --> 0:50:52,809
very nice discussion of the
Garcia effect.


837
0:50:52,809 --> 0:50:56,26
And the Garcia effect goes like
this.


838
0:50:56,26 --> 0:51:0,559
Does anybody here have any food
aversions?


839
0:51:0,559 --> 0:51:2,44
I don't mean foods you don't
like.


840
0:51:2,44 --> 0:51:7,53
I mean foods that really make
you sick.


841
0:51:7,53 --> 0:51:12,974
Often food aversions in humans
and other animals can be formed


842
0:51:12,974 --> 0:51:17,683
through a form of association.
What happens is suppose you


843
0:51:17,683 --> 0:51:21,665
have the flu and you get very
nauseous and then at the same


844
0:51:21,665 --> 0:51:25,3
point you eat some sashimi for
the first time.


845
0:51:25,3 --> 0:51:28,765
The connection between being
nauseous and eating a new food


846
0:51:28,765 --> 0:51:31,611
is very potent.
And even if you know


847
0:51:31,611 --> 0:51:36,953
intellectually full well that
the sashimi isn't why you became


848
0:51:36,953 --> 0:51:42,469
nauseous, still you'll develop
an aversion to this new food.


849
0:51:42,469 --> 0:51:48,373
When I was younger – when I
was a teenager – I drank this


850
0:51:48,373 --> 0:51:51,619
Greek liqueur,
ouzo, with beer.


851
0:51:51,619 --> 0:51:55,61
I didn't have the flu at the
time but I became violently ill.


852
0:51:55,61 --> 0:52:1,0
And as a result I cannot abide
the smell of that Greek liqueur.


853
0:52:1,0 --> 0:52:5,274
Now, thank God it didn't
develop into an aversion to beer


854
0:52:5,274 --> 0:52:7,869
but-- [laughter]
Small miracles.


855
0:52:7,869 --> 0:52:11,692
But the smell is very
distinctive and for me--was new


856
0:52:11,692 --> 0:52:13,811
to me.
And so, through the Garcia


857
0:52:13,811 --> 0:52:16,5
effect I developed a strong
aversion.


858
0:52:16,5 --> 0:52:19,821
What's interesting though is
the aversion is special so if


859
0:52:19,821 --> 0:52:23,922
you take an animal and you give
it a new food and then you give


860
0:52:23,922 --> 0:52:27,76
it a drug to make it nauseous it
will avoid that food.


861
0:52:27,76 --> 0:52:32,102
But if you take an animal and
you give it a new food and then


862
0:52:32,102 --> 0:52:36,3
you shock it very painfully it
won't avoid the new food.


863
0:52:36,3 --> 0:52:39,714
And the idea is that a
connection between what


864
0:52:39,714 --> 0:52:43,28
something tastes and getting
sick is natural.


865
0:52:43,28 --> 0:52:47,155
We are hard wired to say, "Look.
If I'm going to eat a new food


866
0:52:47,155 --> 0:52:50,659
and I'm going to get nauseous,
I'm going to avoid that food."


867
0:52:50,659 --> 0:52:55,78
The Garcia effect is that this
is special to taste and nausea.


868
0:52:55,78 --> 0:52:58,199
It doesn't extend more
generally.


869
0:52:58,199 --> 0:53:2,564
Finally, I talked about phobias
and I'll return to phobias later


870
0:53:2,564 --> 0:53:6,324
on in this course.
But the claim that people have


871
0:53:6,324 --> 0:53:11,73
formed their phobias through
classical conditioning is almost


872
0:53:11,73 --> 0:53:13,954
always wrong.
Instead, it turns out that


873
0:53:13,954 --> 0:53:17,929
there are certain phobias that
we're specially evolved to have.


874
0:53:17,929 --> 0:53:21,845
So, both humans and
chimpanzees, for instance,


875
0:53:21,845 --> 0:53:26,369
are particularly prone to
develop fears of snakes.


876
0:53:26,369 --> 0:53:29,659
And when we talk about the
emotions later on in the course


877
0:53:29,659 --> 0:53:31,909
we'll talk about this in more
detail.


878
0:53:31,909 --> 0:53:35,886
But what seems likely is the
sort of phobias you're likely to


879
0:53:35,886 --> 0:53:39,797
have does not have much to do
with your personal history but


880
0:53:39,797 --> 0:53:43,84
rather it has a lot to do with
your evolutionary history.


881
0:53:43,84 --> 0:53:47,44
Finally, the other reading
you're going to do for this


882
0:53:47,44 --> 0:53:51,244
part--section of the course is
Chomsky's classic article,


883
0:53:51,244 --> 0:53:53,69
his "Review of Verbal
Behavior."


884
0:53:53,69 --> 0:53:57,889
Chomsky is one of the most
prominent intellectuals alive.


885
0:53:57,889 --> 0:54:1,384
He's still a professor at MIT,
still publishes on language and


886
0:54:1,384 --> 0:54:5,8
thought, among other matters.
And the excerpt you're going to


887
0:54:5,8 --> 0:54:7,929
read is from his "Review of
Verbal Behavior."


888
0:54:7,929 --> 0:54:11,302
And this is one of the most
influential intellectual


889
0:54:11,302 --> 0:54:14,938
documents ever written in
psychology because it took the


890
0:54:14,938 --> 0:54:17,65
entire discipline of behaviorism
and,


891
0:54:17,65 --> 0:54:21,384
more than everything else,
more than any other event,


892
0:54:21,384 --> 0:54:25,622
could be said to have destroyed
it or ended it as a dominant


893
0:54:25,622 --> 0:54:29,113
intellectual endeavor.
And Chomsky's argument is


894
0:54:29,113 --> 0:54:32,816
complicated and interesting,
but the main sort of argument


895
0:54:32,816 --> 0:54:35,219
he had to make is--goes like
this.


896
0:54:35,219 --> 0:54:39,567
When it comes to humans,
the notions of reward and


897
0:54:39,567 --> 0:54:44,92
punishment and so on that
Skinner tried to extend to


898
0:54:44,92 --> 0:54:48,44
humans are so vague it's not
science anymore.


899
0:54:48,44 --> 0:54:51,179
And remember the discussion we
had with regard to Freud.


900
0:54:51,179 --> 0:54:55,72
What Skinner--What Chomsky is
raising here is the concern of


901
0:54:55,72 --> 0:54:57,96
unfalsifiablity.
So, here's the sort of example


902
0:54:57,96 --> 0:55:0,562
he would discuss.
Skinner, in his book Verbal


903
0:55:0,562 --> 0:55:2,884
Behavior,
talks about the question of why


904
0:55:2,884 --> 0:55:5,99
do we do things like talk to
ourselves,


905
0:55:5,99 --> 0:55:8,314
imitate sounds,
create art, give bad news to an


906
0:55:8,314 --> 0:55:11,46
enemy, fantasize about pleasant
situations?


907
0:55:11,46 --> 0:55:14,73
And Skinner says that they all
involve reinforcement;


908
0:55:14,73 --> 0:55:16,55
those are all reinforced
behaviors.


909
0:55:16,55 --> 0:55:20,959
But Skinner doesn't literally
mean that when we talk to


910
0:55:20,959 --> 0:55:24,469
ourselves somebody gives us food
pellets.


911
0:55:24,469 --> 0:55:26,859
He doesn't literally mean even
that when we talk to ourselves


912
0:55:26,859 --> 0:55:28,89
somebody pats us on the head and
says, "Good man.


913
0:55:28,89 --> 0:55:31,469
Perfect.
I'm very proud."


914
0:55:31,469 --> 0:55:33,481
What he means,
for instance,


915
0:55:33,481 --> 0:55:36,683
in this case is well,
talking to yourself is


916
0:55:36,683 --> 0:55:41,227
self-reinforcing or giving bad
news to an enemy is reinforcing


917
0:55:41,227 --> 0:55:44,429
because it makes your enemy feel
bad.


918
0:55:44,429 --> 0:55:48,87
Well, Chomsky says the problem
is not that that's wrong.


919
0:55:48,87 --> 0:55:53,67
That's all true.
It's just so vague as to be


920
0:55:53,67 --> 0:55:55,85
useless.
Skinner isn't saying anything


921
0:55:55,85 --> 0:55:58,69
more.
To say giving bad news to an


922
0:55:58,69 --> 0:56:2,51
enemy is reinforcing because it
makes the enemy feel bad doesn't


923
0:56:2,51 --> 0:56:5,464
say anything different from
giving bad news to an enemy


924
0:56:5,464 --> 0:56:9,32
feels good because we like to
give bad news to an enemy.


925
0:56:9,32 --> 0:56:11,65
It's just putting it in more
scientific terms.


926
0:56:11,65 --> 0:56:16,286
More generally,
Chomsky suggests that the law


927
0:56:16,286 --> 0:56:22,61
of effect when applied to humans
is either trivially true,


928
0:56:22,61 --> 0:56:28,228
trivially or uninterestingly
true, or scientifically robust


929
0:56:28,228 --> 0:56:33,594
and obviously false.
So, if you want to expand the


930
0:56:33,594 --> 0:56:38,612
notion of reward or
reinforcement to anything,


931
0:56:38,612 --> 0:56:42,773
then it's true.
So why did you come--those of


932
0:56:42,773 --> 0:56:46,71
you who are not freshmen--Oh,
you--Why did you come?


933
0:56:46,71 --> 0:56:49,59
All of you, why did you come to
Yale for a second semester?


934
0:56:49,59 --> 0:56:52,659
"Well, I repeated my action
because the first semester was


935
0:56:52,659 --> 0:56:54,96
rewarding."
Okay.


936
0:56:54,96 --> 0:56:57,936
What do you mean by that?
Well, you don't literally mean


937
0:56:57,936 --> 0:57:0,989
that somebody rewarded you,
gave you pellets and stuff.


938
0:57:0,989 --> 0:57:3,773
What you mean is you chose to
come there for the second


939
0:57:3,773 --> 0:57:6,161
semester.
And there's nothing wrong with


940
0:57:6,161 --> 0:57:9,44
saying that but we shouldn't
confuse it with science.


941
0:57:9,44 --> 0:57:12,52
And more generally,
the problem is you can talk


942
0:57:12,52 --> 0:57:15,175
about what other people do in
terms of reinforcement and


943
0:57:15,175 --> 0:57:17,901
punishment and operant
conditioning and classical


944
0:57:17,901 --> 0:57:20,521
conditioning.
But in order to do so,


945
0:57:20,521 --> 0:57:24,374
you have to use terms like
"punishment" and "reward" and


946
0:57:24,374 --> 0:57:28,648
"reinforcement" in such a vague
way that in the end you're not


947
0:57:28,648 --> 0:57:33,752
saying anything scientific.
So, behaviorism as a dominant


948
0:57:33,752 --> 0:57:39,477
intellectual field has faded,
but it still leaves behind an


949
0:57:39,477 --> 0:57:44,906
important legacy and it still
stands as one of the major


950
0:57:44,906 --> 0:57:49,94
contributions of twentieth
century psychology.


951
0:57:49,94 --> 0:57:52,42
For one thing,
it has given us a richer


952
0:57:52,42 --> 0:57:54,476
understanding of certain
learning mechanisms,


953
0:57:54,476 --> 0:57:56,8
particularly with regard to
nonhumans.


954
0:57:56,8 --> 0:57:59,663
Mechanisms like habituation,
classical conditioning and


955
0:57:59,663 --> 0:58:2,6
operant conditioning are real;
they can be scientifically


956
0:58:2,6 --> 0:58:4,715
studied;
and they play an important role


957
0:58:4,715 --> 0:58:7,759
in the lives of animals and
probably an important role in


958
0:58:7,759 --> 0:58:11,53
human lives as well.
They just don't explain


959
0:58:11,53 --> 0:58:13,998
everything.
Finally, and this is something


960
0:58:13,998 --> 0:58:16,88
I'm going to return to on
Wednesday actually,


961
0:58:16,88 --> 0:58:21,783
behaviorists have provided
powerful techniques for training


962
0:58:21,783 --> 0:58:26,349
particularly for nonverbal
creatures so this extends to


963
0:58:26,349 --> 0:58:29,58
animal trainers.
But it also extends to people


964
0:58:29,58 --> 0:58:32,98
who want to teach young children
and babies and also want to help


965
0:58:32,98 --> 0:58:35,796
populations like the severely
autistic or the severely


966
0:58:35,796 --> 0:58:37,69
retarded.
Many of these behaviorist


967
0:58:37,69 --> 0:58:39,67
techniques have proven to be
quite useful.


968
0:58:39,67 --> 0:58:43,584
And in that regard,
as well as in other regards,


969
0:58:43,584 --> 0:58:47,0
it stands as an important
contribution.


970
0:58:47,0 --> 0:60:47,0
