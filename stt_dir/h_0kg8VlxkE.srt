2
0:0:16,63 --> 0:0:17,625
THOMAS MORTON: Hi,
it's Thomas.


3
0:0:17,625 --> 0:0:21,7
We're in Kurdistan in northern
Iraq near the Iran border.


4
0:0:21,7 --> 0:0:24,54
We are hanging out with the
women fighters of PJAK, Free


5
0:0:24,54 --> 0:0:26,18
Life for Kurdistan Party.


6
0:0:26,18 --> 0:0:29,184
[GUNFIRE]


7
0:0:29,184 --> 0:0:35,411
[MUSIC PLAYING]


8
0:0:35,411 --> 0:0:38,9
THOMAS MORTON: This is northern
Iraq, a suburban


9
0:0:38,9 --> 0:0:41,16
paradise of shopping malls,
fast food, and the most


10
0:0:41,16 --> 0:0:43,7
advanced movie technology
on the planet.


11
0:0:43,7 --> 0:0:44,486
Holy shit.


12
0:0:44,486 --> 0:0:47,88
They are so far ahead of us
in dimensional cinema.


13
0:0:47,88 --> 0:0:50,16
It's a pretty far cry from
southern Iraq, probably


14
0:0:50,16 --> 0:0:52,633
because it sat out the war
that's still ravaging the rest


15
0:0:52,633 --> 0:0:56,35
of the country almost a decade
after we started it.


16
0:0:56,35 --> 0:0:59,2
Northern Iraq, also called
Iraqi Kurdistan, is a


17
0:0:59,2 --> 0:1:2,3
semi-autonomous state with its
own regional government mostly


18
0:1:2,3 --> 0:1:5,17
made up of Iraq's Kurdish
ethnic minority.


19
0:1:5,17 --> 0:1:6,96
The Kurds are mountain folk
who live in the overlap


20
0:1:6,96 --> 0:1:9,8
between Iraq, Syria, Turkey,
and Iran, but don't really


21
0:1:9,8 --> 0:1:11,245
belong to any of them.


22
0:1:11,245 --> 0:1:13,756
The Kurdish goal for the last
century or so has been to


23
0:1:13,756 --> 0:1:14,61
carve out a homeland for


24
0:1:14,61 --> 0:1:17,2
themselves, a greater Kurdistan.


25
0:1:17,2 --> 0:1:19,95
Which they've gone about the
traditional way by forming


26
0:1:19,95 --> 0:1:22,45
guerrilla armies, blowing up a
bunch of crap, and generally


27
0:1:22,45 --> 0:1:24,67
making trouble for the countries
whose territory they


28
0:1:24,67 --> 0:1:26,7
consider their own.


29
0:1:26,7 --> 0:1:29,38
So far, the place they've had
the most success is Iraq,


30
0:1:29,38 --> 0:1:32,3
though through no small
help of the USA.


31
0:1:32,3 --> 0:1:34,88
We're on the corner of Texas
Avenue and New Mexico Lane in


32
0:1:34,88 --> 0:1:37,13
the middle of the American
village in Kurdistan in


33
0:1:37,13 --> 0:1:38,14
northern Iraq.


34
0:1:38,14 --> 0:1:40,93
Kurdistan is, kind of, a major
exception to what's happened


35
0:1:40,93 --> 0:1:42,92
over the last 10
years in Iraq.


36
0:1:42,92 --> 0:1:45,23
It's where the rest of the
country has fallen into


37
0:1:45,23 --> 0:1:48,11
bloodshed and divisive fighting,
it's blossomed.


38
0:1:48,11 --> 0:1:50,55
They've had a tremendous
industry spring up here.


39
0:1:50,55 --> 0:1:52,1
There's developments
everywhere.


40
0:1:52,1 --> 0:1:53,7
They're building gated
communities that look like


41
0:1:53,7 --> 0:1:59,53
they're somewhere in Southern
California, and it's nice.


42
0:1:59,53 --> 0:2:3,65
HIWA OSMAN: We are looking to
the West as models for us to


43
0:2:3,65 --> 0:2:5,415
conduct our affairs by.


44
0:2:5,415 --> 0:2:10,36
And what we are seeing from the
ruling parties in Baghdad,


45
0:2:10,36 --> 0:2:14,19
they are looking to East
and to the immediate


46
0:2:14,19 --> 0:2:15,14
neighborhoods.


47
0:2:15,14 --> 0:2:19,93
You go to any other nation in
the region, you will find that


48
0:2:19,93 --> 0:2:23,68
their anti-Americanism
runs rife.


49
0:2:23,68 --> 0:2:29,38
The only nation that accepts
America fully, despite the few


50
0:2:29,38 --> 0:2:32,3
occasions of betrayal
in history,


51
0:2:32,3 --> 0:2:33,9
is the Kurdish nation.


52
0:2:33,9 --> 0:2:35,18
THOMAS MORTON: Throughout their
history, the Kurds have


53
0:2:35,18 --> 0:2:37,55
been particularly adept at
playing their enemies against


54
0:2:37,55 --> 0:2:38,83
each other.


55
0:2:38,83 --> 0:2:40,78
In the '80s, this meant joining
with Iran against


56
0:2:40,78 --> 0:2:43,83
Saddam Hussein which put them at
odds with then Iraqi allies


57
0:2:43,83 --> 0:2:46,36
us, meaning America.


58
0:2:46,36 --> 0:2:48,21
Once Saddam got the upper hand,
though, and started his


59
0:2:48,21 --> 0:2:51,34
infamous Anfal genocide campaign
against them, marked


60
0:2:51,34 --> 0:2:53,78
by mass civilian killings and
the indiscriminate use of


61
0:2:53,78 --> 0:2:56,64
chemical weapons, the Kurdish
rebels went from terrorists to


62
0:2:56,64 --> 0:2:59,44
freedom fighters in
American eyes.


63
0:2:59,44 --> 0:3:2,1
During the first Gulf War, when
George Bush spontaneously


64
0:3:2,1 --> 0:3:5,12
called on the Iraqis to rise up
against Saddam, the Kurds


65
0:3:5,12 --> 0:3:7,54
took this as a sign of America's
full-fledged support


66
0:3:7,54 --> 0:3:10,64
and launched a massive assault
on the retreating Iraqi Army,


67
0:3:10,64 --> 0:3:13,6
which failed miserably.


68
0:3:13,6 --> 0:3:15,69
During the subsequent bloodshed
and refugee crisis,


69
0:3:15,69 --> 0:3:18,61
US military was forced, largely
through bad press, to


70
0:3:18,61 --> 0:3:20,886
make good on their implicit
promise and actually give the


71
0:3:20,886 --> 0:3:22,63
Kurds their support.


72
0:3:22,63 --> 0:3:25,0
To this end, they established
a no-fly zone at the 36th


73
0:3:25,0 --> 0:3:27,31
parallel to keep the
Iraqi Army at bay.


74
0:3:27,31 --> 0:3:31,38
And the rest has been smooth
sailing for Iraqi Kurdistan.


75
0:3:31,38 --> 0:3:33,66
I mean, there was a bloody,
fractious civil war for a few


76
0:3:33,66 --> 0:3:36,15
years over which rebel group
would lead the new country.


77
0:3:36,15 --> 0:3:39,2
But otherwise, Kurdistan has
been doing well for itself and


78
0:3:39,2 --> 0:3:41,66
is generally held up as one of
the few success stories of


79
0:3:41,66 --> 0:3:43,25
American interventionism.


80
0:3:43,25 --> 0:3:45,12
ROBERT BAER: They absolutely
love us.


81
0:3:45,12 --> 0:3:46,79
They give us the oil, they
give us anything.


82
0:3:46,79 --> 0:3:47,92
I mean, we've done more
for the Kurds


83
0:3:47,92 --> 0:3:49,6
than anybody in history.


84
0:3:49,6 --> 0:3:53,3
We beat their enemy.


85
0:3:53,3 --> 0:3:54,61
THOMAS MORTON: While Iraq is
more or less a lock for the


86
0:3:54,61 --> 0:3:57,68
Kurds, Kurds in Turkey, Syria,
and Iran, are still fighting


87
0:3:57,68 --> 0:4:1,24
for independence and even
basic civil rights using


88
0:4:1,24 --> 0:4:5,91
guerrilla warfare and suicide
bombings to their ends.


89
0:4:5,91 --> 0:4:7,83
The US State Department
considers most of these groups


90
0:4:7,83 --> 0:4:10,82
terrorist organizations, which
is a bit confusing considering


91
0:4:10,82 --> 0:4:13,2
their support for the old
Peshmerga guerrillas, who are


92
0:4:13,2 --> 0:4:15,84
now running the show in the
entire Kurdish government.


93
0:4:15,84 --> 0:4:19,0
One of these new groups, PJAK,
was formed in 2004 right after


94
0:4:19,0 --> 0:4:21,73
the American invasion to
specifically target American


95
0:4:21,73 --> 0:4:23,76
enemy Iran.


96
0:4:23,76 --> 0:4:26,32
PJAK has become notorious for
their largely female fighting


97
0:4:26,32 --> 0:4:29,52
force and bears a conveniently
vague relationship with the


98
0:4:29,52 --> 0:4:33,68
also gender equal PKK, who fight
American ally Turkey.


99
0:4:33,68 --> 0:4:39,43



100
0:4:39,43 --> 0:4:42,415
We're on the road from
Erbil to Rania.


101
0:4:42,415 --> 0:4:44,6
Rania is up in the hills.


102
0:4:44,6 --> 0:4:47,5
Today is the eighth or ninth
birthday of PJAK, and they're


103
0:4:47,5 --> 0:4:50,192
having a little festival up
here that we are going


104
0:4:50,192 --> 0:4:51,52
to take part in.


105
0:4:51,52 --> 0:4:53,57
The PJAK birthday party was
being held at a secret


106
0:4:53,57 --> 0:4:56,6
mountain bee farm close
to the Iranian border.


107
0:4:56,6 --> 0:4:58,85
It was technically a media
event, but since having higher


108
0:4:58,85 --> 0:5:1,32
ups from all the major Kurdish
guerrilla groups in one


109
0:5:1,32 --> 0:5:4,39
location made the risk of an
Iranian or Turkish rocket


110
0:5:4,39 --> 0:5:7,49
strike especially risky,
security precautions were


111
0:5:7,49 --> 0:5:10,56
taken that effectively made us
the only media covering it.


112
0:5:10,56 --> 0:5:12,1
So it was kind of like
a personal press


113
0:5:12,1 --> 0:5:13,84
conference just for us.


114
0:5:13,84 --> 0:5:14,48
So we're here.


115
0:5:14,48 --> 0:5:19,0
We just, we've been driving in
the mountains for a while.


116
0:5:19,0 --> 0:5:20,53
This doesn't look like Iraq.


117
0:5:20,53 --> 0:5:22,65
And I think, actually, we're
pretty close to Iran.


118
0:5:22,65 --> 0:5:27,17



119
0:5:27,17 --> 0:5:29,45
PJAK was designated a terrorist
organization by the


120
0:5:29,45 --> 0:5:32,23
Obama administration this year,
which made me a little


121
0:5:32,23 --> 0:5:34,37
nervous that running the
receiving line here might turn


122
0:5:34,37 --> 0:5:39,7
into a personal Hanoi Jane
moment, or moments.


123
0:5:39,7 --> 0:5:42,4
Actually, PJAK occupies a sort
of political gray zone where


124
0:5:42,4 --> 0:5:44,54
you're not allowed to give them
money, but the government


125
0:5:44,54 --> 0:5:46,33
isn't really trying to
stop them from doing


126
0:5:46,33 --> 0:5:48,6
their thing in Iran.


127
0:5:48,6 --> 0:5:50,39
Most likely because the thing
they do kind of ties in with


128
0:5:50,39 --> 0:5:52,51
the things we want
to do, which is,


129
0:5:52,51 --> 0:5:54,73
namely, fuck with Iran.


130
0:5:54,73 --> 0:5:56,9
The Kurdish Independence
Movement


131
0:5:56,9 --> 0:5:57,78
is notoriously factional.


132
0:5:57,78 --> 0:6:0,42
It's your basic "Life of
Brian" alphabet soup.


133
0:6:0,42 --> 0:6:6,64
There's the KDP, the PUK, the
PKK, the KCK, PJAK, All of


134
0:6:6,64 --> 0:6:8,9
whom have the same ultimate
goal but just slightly


135
0:6:8,9 --> 0:6:11,3
different ways of trying
to accomplish it.


136
0:6:11,3 --> 0:6:13,2
We tried to get a guy from the
PKK to explain the whole


137
0:6:13,2 --> 0:6:15,39
spread for us, although
he claimed he wasn't


138
0:6:15,39 --> 0:6:17,99
part of PKK but KCK.


139
0:6:17,99 --> 0:6:20,41
We're not exactly sure there's
a difference, though.


140
0:6:20,41 --> 0:6:25,42
RAJ VALAT: Today, approximately
50 million Kurds


141
0:6:25,42 --> 0:6:27,88
living in four parts
of Kurdistan.


142
0:6:27,88 --> 0:6:30,68
It's the same problem, but
this is in Iran, in


143
0:6:30,68 --> 0:6:32,78
Turkey, or in Syria.


144
0:6:32,78 --> 0:6:37,81
We are one people, and
basically, the solution that


145
0:6:37,81 --> 0:6:43,59
we want to see is democratic
autonomy for Kurds and


146
0:6:43,59 --> 0:6:47,2
democracy for Turkey,
for Iran, for Syria,


147
0:6:47,2 --> 0:6:48,48
for Iraq, as well.


148
0:6:48,48 --> 0:6:57,23



149
0:6:57,23 --> 0:6:58,9
THOMAS MORTON: PJAK's
emergence from the


150
0:6:58,9 --> 0:7:1,18
anti-Turkish PKK seems like a
pretty transparent attempt to


151
0:7:1,18 --> 0:7:2,79
snag American support
while still


152
0:7:2,79 --> 0:7:4,72
fighting one of its allies.


153
0:7:4,72 --> 0:7:7,86
PKK's leader, though supposedly
not PJAK's, even


154
0:7:7,86 --> 0:7:10,55
told the press in its early days
that if the CIA wanted to


155
0:7:10,55 --> 0:7:14,36
use PJAK to destabilize Iran,
it would be a great idea.


156
0:7:14,36 --> 0:7:15,39
Who supports the Kurds?


157
0:7:15,39 --> 0:7:18,782
Like who are your allies
outside of the area?


158
0:7:18,782 --> 0:7:22,65
RAJ VALAT: Our allies
are our people.


159
0:7:22,65 --> 0:7:25,35
And our allies are mountains.


160
0:7:25,35 --> 0:7:27,5
That's all.


161
0:7:27,5 --> 0:7:29,4
THOMAS MORTON: Not entirely sold
on this reply, we figured


162
0:7:29,4 --> 0:7:31,19
spending a day in the mountains
with some of their


163
0:7:31,19 --> 0:7:33,44
female fighters would help
answer the question of who


164
0:7:33,44 --> 0:7:34,86
PJAK's real allies are.


165
0:7:34,86 --> 0:9:34,86
