0:0:10,56 --> 0:0:12,1
DERRICK BECKLES: We went down
to West Virginia to take a


3
0:0:12,1 --> 0:0:15,35
look at coal mining, because
instead of going underground


4
0:0:15,35 --> 0:0:19,41
like they used to for decades
and generations, they have a


5
0:0:19,41 --> 0:0:21,446
whole new way of doing it
that blew our minds.


6
0:0:21,446 --> 0:0:24,25



7
0:0:24,25 --> 0:0:27,5
We're on our way up
to Larry Gibson's.


8
0:0:27,5 --> 0:0:28,7
He lives on this mountain.


9
0:0:28,7 --> 0:0:33,33
And you'll see his property just
has an incredible view of


10
0:0:33,33 --> 0:0:36,58
what's going on around here.


11
0:0:36,58 --> 0:0:38,45
By the way, us being up here
isn't exactly what they're


12
0:0:38,45 --> 0:0:40,99
thrilled about.


13
0:0:40,99 --> 0:0:42,92
These companies don't
want people to know


14
0:0:42,92 --> 0:0:44,41
this is going on.


15
0:0:44,41 --> 0:0:48,32
The locals are kind of screwed,
because this is how


16
0:0:48,32 --> 0:0:49,95
they make their living.


17
0:0:49,95 --> 0:0:53,44
So if they shoot their mouths
off too much, they're shooting


18
0:0:53,44 --> 0:0:55,238
themselves in the foot.


19
0:0:55,238 --> 0:0:56,488
[EXPLOSION]


20
0:0:56,488 --> 0:0:59,7



21
0:0:59,7 --> 0:0:59,549
[EXPLOSION]


22
0:0:59,549 --> 0:1:0,986
DERRICK BECKLES: Holy shit.


23
0:1:0,986 --> 0:1:3,87



24
0:1:3,87 --> 0:1:8,13
This is the new way that
we mine for coal.


25
0:1:8,13 --> 0:1:10,43
I could easily tell you we're
in Afghanistan in the


26
0:1:10,43 --> 0:1:12,66
mountains, and we're looking for
Osama bin Laden, and you'd


27
0:1:12,66 --> 0:1:14,81
believe me.


28
0:1:14,81 --> 0:1:18,69
This is the second most
biodiverse area in the world.


29
0:1:18,69 --> 0:1:23,44
And unfortunately, we need
what's under these mountains,


30
0:1:23,44 --> 0:1:26,81
and we'll do anything
to get it.


31
0:1:26,81 --> 0:1:27,89
DWIGHT SIEMIACZKO: Coal
companies like to do


32
0:1:27,89 --> 0:1:31,2
mountaintop removal because they
can get more coal quicker


33
0:1:31,2 --> 0:1:33,156
and cheaper with less people.


34
0:1:33,156 --> 0:1:36,85
The bad part of that is its
environmental impact that it


35
0:1:36,85 --> 0:1:38,725
has on the streams and
the environment.


36
0:1:38,725 --> 0:1:41,933
Because you just literally
destroyed the mountaintops and


37
0:1:41,933 --> 0:1:47,65
the valleys below them, where
a deep mines does not.


38
0:1:47,65 --> 0:1:49,13
B.I. SAMMONS: When the
old timers mined


39
0:1:49,13 --> 0:1:51,1
coal, it was hard work.


40
0:1:51,1 --> 0:1:56,91
But now they need to mine coal
faster than men can mine it.


41
0:1:56,91 --> 0:2:0,45
So they're taking the tops off
of mountains to get it faster.


42
0:2:0,45 --> 0:2:5,69
When George Bush first took
office, he said, mine the


43
0:2:5,69 --> 0:2:9,33
coal, get the oil,
get the gas.


44
0:2:9,33 --> 0:2:10,69
The country needs it.


45
0:2:10,69 --> 0:2:12,51
So he just opened the doors.


46
0:2:12,51 --> 0:2:16,33
You know, this is
Pandora's Box.


47
0:2:16,33 --> 0:2:19,27
DERRICK BECKLES: Coal is also
being sold to North Americans


48
0:2:19,27 --> 0:2:23,96
as this beacon for
self-sufficiency in terms of a


49
0:2:23,96 --> 0:2:26,5
fossil fuel that we
can depend on.


50
0:2:26,5 --> 0:2:27,67
But this is how we get it.


51
0:2:27,67 --> 0:2:30,63
And then you heat your
homes with it.


52
0:2:30,63 --> 0:2:33,355
DWIGHT SIEMIACZKO: But those are
things that happens under


53
0:2:33,355 --> 0:2:36,46
the public's eye, under
their noses.


54
0:2:36,46 --> 0:2:41,45
They just don't realize
what is at stake here.


55
0:2:41,45 --> 0:2:42,7
And the coal companies get by.


56
0:2:42,7 --> 0:2:44,91



57
0:2:44,91 --> 0:2:46,75
CHRIS HAMILTON: I guess every
single mountain out there is


58
0:2:46,75 --> 0:2:49,13
important to somebody
to be retained in


59
0:2:49,13 --> 0:2:51,69
its original contour.


60
0:2:51,69 --> 0:2:55,5
But mining is what we do
here in West Virginia.


61
0:2:55,5 --> 0:2:57,76
And it's something we
do extremely well.


62
0:2:57,76 --> 0:2:59,96
DERRICK BECKLES: Yeah, and
there's no reason--


63
0:2:59,96 --> 0:3:2,29
absolutely, I don't think
there's any reason there


64
0:3:2,29 --> 0:3:4,4
shouldn't be pride taken
in that at all.


65
0:3:4,4 --> 0:3:9,0
But to be frank, I was just
horrified at this form of


66
0:3:9,0 --> 0:3:12,27
mining, where they just kind
of take away mountaintops.


67
0:3:12,27 --> 0:3:15,29
And I'm wondering what that
impact is, or what you


68
0:3:15,29 --> 0:3:17,59
consider the impact to be.


69
0:3:17,59 --> 0:3:20,83
CHRIS HAMILTON: There's no
pretty way to mine coal.


70
0:3:20,83 --> 0:3:27,43
Nature has a remarkable way of
healing itself over time.


71
0:3:27,43 --> 0:3:31,99
DERRICK BECKLES: So those are
the mountains of West


72
0:3:31,99 --> 0:3:34,715
Virginia, which so many
people talk about.


73
0:3:34,715 --> 0:3:39,5
And then when you see it from
the air, it is another level


74
0:3:39,5 --> 0:3:42,245
of understanding the devastation
around here.


75
0:3:42,245 --> 0:3:45,31
CHRIS HAMILTON: To the extent
that a mountain is removed, a


76
0:3:45,31 --> 0:3:46,86
little bit of a misnomer
there.


77
0:3:46,86 --> 0:3:49,42
We're removing mountaintops.


78
0:3:49,42 --> 0:3:53,58
We're not removing the
entire mountain.


79
0:3:53,58 --> 0:3:54,71
DERRICK BECKLES:
So how far down


80
0:3:54,71 --> 0:3:55,32
would you go, for example?


81
0:3:55,32 --> 0:3:56,81
CHRIS HAMILTON: Well, sometimes


82
0:3:56,81 --> 0:3:57,7
it's the ground level.


83
0:3:57,7 --> 0:3:58,99
But it's usually just
the upper--


84
0:3:58,99 --> 0:4:0,3
DERRICK BECKLES: Sometimes it
is the mountain, though.


85
0:4:0,3 --> 0:4:3,2
CHRIS HAMILTON: Sometimes
it is.


86
0:4:3,2 --> 0:4:5,67
DERRICK BECKLES: After talking
to the Coal Association


87
0:4:5,67 --> 0:4:8,0
representatives, I have to say
that if you're interested in


88
0:4:8,0 --> 0:4:12,875
the world looking like Mars
or Pluto, this is a


89
0:4:12,875 --> 0:4:14,125
great place to start.


90
0:4:14,125 --> 0:4:20,589



91
0:4:20,589 --> 0:4:24,8
Hi, I'm visiting you from
Zebulon Five, a new planet


92
0:4:24,8 --> 0:4:25,66
that Earth is conquering.


93
0:4:25,66 --> 0:4:31,92
We're currently blasting away
to make room for Earth


94
0:4:31,92 --> 0:4:33,1
inhabitants.


95
0:4:33,1 --> 0:4:36,97
Luckily, we can breathe here,
and it looks just enough like


96
0:4:36,97 --> 0:4:38,505
West Virginia to make
you feel at home.


97
0:4:38,505 --> 0:4:47,379



98
0:4:47,379 --> 0:4:48,49
CHRIS HAMILTON: They've
been surface


99
0:4:48,49 --> 0:4:50,7
mining for 40, 50 years.


100
0:4:50,7 --> 0:4:55,23
So while we're here mining, if
we can reconfigure and reclaim


101
0:4:55,23 --> 0:4:59,58
this land to accommodate that
post-mine land use, it's going


102
0:4:59,58 --> 0:5:2,88
to be a win-win for everybody.


103
0:5:2,88 --> 0:5:3,62
DERRICK BECKLES: They're
planing these


104
0:5:3,62 --> 0:5:5,742
things off as a win-win.


105
0:5:5,742 --> 0:5:8,1
And I'm sure you've
heard this.


106
0:5:8,1 --> 0:5:12,1
You're getting land for things
like an airfield or a golf


107
0:5:12,1 --> 0:5:14,91
course, or a shopping
center can be built


108
0:5:14,91 --> 0:5:16,32
on this planed land.


109
0:5:16,32 --> 0:5:18,265
WAYNE LANHAM: Show us the
shopping centers on them.


110
0:5:18,265 --> 0:5:20,586
Show us the airports.


111
0:5:20,586 --> 0:5:22,37
OK, show me the first one.


112
0:5:22,37 --> 0:5:23,13
DWIGHT SIEMIACZKO:
It's not there.


113
0:5:23,13 --> 0:5:25,186
I don't care what Chris Hamilton
or anybody else is


114
0:5:25,186 --> 0:5:25,99
telling you.


115
0:5:25,99 --> 0:5:27,11
It's not true.


116
0:5:27,11 --> 0:5:28,89
It is not true.


117
0:5:28,89 --> 0:5:31,766
As far as growing back in 100
years, there's no way.


118
0:5:31,766 --> 0:5:33,2
There's no way.


119
0:5:33,2 --> 0:5:34,49
DERRICK BECKLES: Let's
say 200 or 300.


120
0:5:34,49 --> 0:5:35,39
DWIGHT SIEMIACZKO:
200 or 300 years.


121
0:5:35,39 --> 0:5:36,83
I mean, there's no way.


122
0:5:36,83 --> 0:5:38,0
There's no way.


123
0:5:38,0 --> 0:5:41,95
If you don't have topsoil there,
it's not going to grow.


124
0:5:41,95 --> 0:5:44,49
WAYNE LANHAM: If you just go--
rabbits, right-- that deep,


125
0:5:44,49 --> 0:5:45,76
you're out of the black dirt.


126
0:5:45,76 --> 0:5:47,55
You're down in the yellow.


127
0:5:47,55 --> 0:5:49,11
Just that deep.


128
0:5:49,11 --> 0:5:50,79
DWIGHT SIEMIACZKO: From a
distance, it looks like a


129
0:5:50,79 --> 0:5:51,435
green pasture.


130
0:5:51,435 --> 0:5:52,55
WAYNE LANHAM: It's beautiful.


131
0:5:52,55 --> 0:5:54,333
Well, they call it
hydroseeding.


132
0:5:54,333 --> 0:5:56,99
Got this big hose like us in
here now, and we can spray it


133
0:5:56,99 --> 0:5:59,47
on those walls, and it's
so lush and green.


134
0:5:59,47 --> 0:6:1,45
DWIGHT SIEMIACZKO: And it
would grow on the walls.


135
0:6:1,45 --> 0:6:1,795
WAYNE LANHAM: No, really.


136
0:6:1,795 --> 0:6:4,263
You can spray it on us,
and make it grow.


137
0:6:4,263 --> 0:6:5,11
DWIGHT SIEMIACZKO: Yeah.


138
0:6:5,11 --> 0:6:6,25
It's grass on steroids.


139
0:6:6,25 --> 0:6:7,3
That's what we call it.


140
0:6:7,3 --> 0:6:9,85
WAYNE LANHAM: But it's
rock right under it.


141
0:6:9,85 --> 0:6:10,425
DWIGHT SIEMIACZKO: It's
a camouflage.


142
0:6:10,425 --> 0:6:11,51
WAYNE LANHAM: It's
a camouflage.


143
0:6:11,51 --> 0:6:13,98
DWIGHT SIEMIACZKO:
It's camouflage.


144
0:6:13,98 --> 0:6:14,63
DERRICK BECKLES: This is it.


145
0:6:14,63 --> 0:6:16,29
This is hydroseed.


146
0:6:16,29 --> 0:6:20,24
And they spray the mountains
with this, and then everything


147
0:6:20,24 --> 0:6:21,3
grows back.


148
0:6:21,3 --> 0:6:22,42
Everything's fine.


149
0:6:22,42 --> 0:6:24,91
It's magical pixie dust.


150
0:6:24,91 --> 0:6:29,72
It feels like mulched toilet
paper, dyed green.


151
0:6:29,72 --> 0:6:31,7
I mean, there's little
seeds in it, I think.


152
0:6:31,7 --> 0:6:33,55
I can't even tell.


153
0:6:33,55 --> 0:6:38,175
It'll look just like it used
to, trees and everything.


154
0:6:38,175 --> 0:6:40,59
And you can see that
this is topsoil.


155
0:6:40,59 --> 0:6:43,96



156
0:6:43,96 --> 0:6:46,23
Really good topsoil.


157
0:6:46,23 --> 0:6:48,39
And then once they put this
really good topsoil down, you


158
0:6:48,39 --> 0:6:50,79
can come anywhere around here
and check it out yourself.


159
0:6:50,79 --> 0:6:55,35
It's done with respect and
attention to detail.


160
0:6:55,35 --> 0:6:59,57
And then they spray it with
green toilet paper.


161
0:6:59,57 --> 0:7:0,9
And everything's
back to normal.


162
0:7:0,9 --> 0:7:7,14



163
0:7:7,14 --> 0:7:10,31
So nobody's losing.


164
0:7:10,31 --> 0:7:11,56
Nobody.


165
0:7:11,56 --> 0:7:14,4



166
0:7:14,4 --> 0:7:16,395
It's not exactly surprising to
find out that the miners and


167
0:7:16,395 --> 0:7:18,34
the mining companies
don't get along.


168
0:7:18,34 --> 0:7:21,34
But to truly understand why and
how they don't get along,


169
0:7:21,34 --> 0:7:22,886
you have to go to the
miners themselves.


170
0:7:22,886 --> 0:7:25,85



171
0:7:25,85 --> 0:7:27,84
WAYNE LANHAM: I'm Wayne Lanham,
retired coal miner,


172
0:7:27,84 --> 0:7:28,82
disabled coal miner.


173
0:7:28,82 --> 0:7:31,13
Lived here all my life.


174
0:7:31,13 --> 0:7:32,64
57 years old.


175
0:7:32,64 --> 0:7:35,53
I'm a radical, a redneck.


176
0:7:35,53 --> 0:7:37,64
Rednecks started this state,
you know that?


177
0:7:37,64 --> 0:7:40,41
Because when they had the coal
mining wars, you wore a red


178
0:7:40,41 --> 0:7:42,35
bandanna around your neck.


179
0:7:42,35 --> 0:7:44,7
That way I could recognize
you guys.


180
0:7:44,7 --> 0:7:46,99
Those guys over behind those
bushes are union men.


181
0:7:46,99 --> 0:7:47,83
They're on my side.


182
0:7:47,83 --> 0:7:49,4
They're coal miners.


183
0:7:49,4 --> 0:7:52,35
DWIGHT SIEMIACZKO: The coal
industry in this state has a


184
0:7:52,35 --> 0:7:54,8
horrible record on
human relations.


185
0:7:54,8 --> 0:7:59,62
In this particular watershed
here, in 1913 and 1914 there


186
0:7:59,62 --> 0:8:0,52
was a coal strike here.


187
0:8:0,52 --> 0:8:2,4
They was trying to unionize.


188
0:8:2,4 --> 0:8:6,12
HERSHAL WILEY: The county
had police there.


189
0:8:6,12 --> 0:8:8,61
The state had state
police there.


190
0:8:8,61 --> 0:8:10,59
WAYNE LANHAM: And when they come
by Holly Grove-- because


191
0:8:10,59 --> 0:8:12,53
the people who had been kicked
out was living in tents.


192
0:8:12,53 --> 0:8:13,54
It was tent city.


193
0:8:13,54 --> 0:8:16,86
When they come by, they opened
up on them with a machine gun.


194
0:8:16,86 --> 0:8:18,99
Companies did that.


195
0:8:18,99 --> 0:8:21,5
That's why there's such
a hard feelings


196
0:8:21,5 --> 0:8:22,68
towards coal companies.


197
0:8:22,68 --> 0:8:24,99
They just came up and
shot the people.


198
0:8:24,99 --> 0:8:26,57
DWIGHT SIEMIACZKO: When
you are hired,


199
0:8:26,57 --> 0:8:28,84
you sign a quit slip.


200
0:8:28,84 --> 0:8:31,51
You sign a slip that
says you quit.


201
0:8:31,51 --> 0:8:32,78
It's not dated.


202
0:8:32,78 --> 0:8:36,25
So when it gets down to the
point that you do something


203
0:8:36,25 --> 0:8:39,39
that I don't like as a coal
operator, I'll tell you.


204
0:8:39,39 --> 0:8:40,84
I'll say, Wayne, today's
your last day.


205
0:8:40,84 --> 0:8:42,78
Well, why?


206
0:8:42,78 --> 0:8:43,429
Is something wrong?


207
0:8:43,429 --> 0:8:44,2
Yeah, you quit.


208
0:8:44,2 --> 0:8:44,97
Oh no, I didn't quit.


209
0:8:44,97 --> 0:8:46,272
Oh yeah, here's your
quit slip.


210
0:8:46,272 --> 0:8:48,1
You signed this.


211
0:8:48,1 --> 0:8:51,12
And you do not have
a leg to stand on.


212
0:8:51,12 --> 0:8:54,635
Most people outside of the
state, and some who are in


213
0:8:54,635 --> 0:8:56,4
this state, don't realize
the history.


214
0:8:56,4 --> 0:8:59,725
And it's the same pattern
being played over again.


215
0:8:59,725 --> 0:9:2,89



216
0:9:2,89 --> 0:9:4,13
DERRICK BECKLES: At the end of
every shift, I noticed that


217
0:9:4,13 --> 0:9:6,17
you could actually hear the
mountain powering down and


218
0:9:6,17 --> 0:9:7,89
then powering back up again.


219
0:9:7,89 --> 0:9:10,47
And that's just because coal
mining around here is a


220
0:9:10,47 --> 0:9:12,93
24-hour operation.


221
0:9:12,93 --> 0:9:15,26
At the end of the day shift, the
miners go to their local


222
0:9:15,26 --> 0:9:18,235
watering holes, so we
follow them there.


223
0:9:18,235 --> 0:9:20,183
MALE SPEAKER: I love to coal
mine, because it's a


224
0:9:20,183 --> 0:9:22,131
adrenaline rush.


225
0:9:22,131 --> 0:9:23,592
You know?


226
0:9:23,592 --> 0:9:24,79
FEMALE SPEAKER: Right.


227
0:9:24,79 --> 0:9:26,514
MALE SPEAKER: I brought
her back from Florida.


228
0:9:26,514 --> 0:9:27,488
And I said, you know what?


229
0:9:27,488 --> 0:9:29,64
I'm working to come home
and take care of you.


230
0:9:29,64 --> 0:9:31,768
Her job is to take
care of my house,


231
0:9:31,768 --> 0:9:33,205
take care of my daughter.


232
0:9:33,205 --> 0:9:34,642
I do everything else.


233
0:9:34,642 --> 0:9:35,6
And I love her for that.


234
0:9:35,6 --> 0:9:37,37
You know?


235
0:9:37,37 --> 0:9:40,1
FEMALE SPEAKER: I didn't
want to come into this.


236
0:9:40,1 --> 0:9:41,83
It just happened.


237
0:9:41,83 --> 0:9:44,66
I mean, yeah the money is good,
and the money is great.


238
0:9:44,66 --> 0:9:50,9
But the money is not worth
nothing but him.


239
0:9:50,9 --> 0:9:53,9
MALE SPEAKER: Being totally
honest with you, do you think


240
0:9:53,9 --> 0:9:57,1
I like going underground,
knowing that I can die?


241
0:9:57,1 --> 0:10:2,22
Knowing that there's a big
chance that I can die?


242
0:10:2,22 --> 0:10:3,54
I do sometimes.


243
0:10:3,54 --> 0:10:6,51
MALE SPEAKER: All coal miners
deserve $35 an hour or more,


244
0:10:6,51 --> 0:10:7,94
because they work
their ass off.


245
0:10:7,94 --> 0:10:9,81
And without them, the
country would fail.


246
0:10:9,81 --> 0:10:12,21
DERRICK BECKLES: So right now
to me, coal mining is a


247
0:10:12,21 --> 0:10:14,33
necessary evil.


248
0:10:14,33 --> 0:10:17,87
And it's not the miners
that are the ones--


249
0:10:17,87 --> 0:10:18,848
MALE SPEAKER: We're not evil.


250
0:10:18,848 --> 0:10:20,315
The miners themselves
aren't the bad ones.


251
0:10:20,315 --> 0:10:20,926
You've met me.


252
0:10:20,926 --> 0:10:21,293
You've met him.


253
0:10:21,293 --> 0:10:21,782
You've met him.


254
0:10:21,782 --> 0:10:24,492
We're not bad guys.


255
0:10:24,492 --> 0:10:26,805
MALE SPEAKER: But the corporate
American CEOs and


256
0:10:26,805 --> 0:10:28,765
people like that, they're
going to want to


257
0:10:28,765 --> 0:10:30,45
make the big dollars.


258
0:10:30,45 --> 0:10:31,68
And we're just tools.


259
0:10:31,68 --> 0:10:33,79
DERRICK BECKLES: If the mines
aren't so good, if you've


260
0:10:33,79 --> 0:10:37,58
known this for generations, why
don't you just leave and


261
0:10:37,58 --> 0:10:39,8
go somewhere else and get
a job somewhere else?


262
0:10:39,8 --> 0:10:41,41
MALE SPEAKER: I mean, it's like
you graduate from high


263
0:10:41,41 --> 0:10:43,97
school, and we say, we'll give
you a job making $17 an hour


264
0:10:43,97 --> 0:10:44,43
working in the mines.


265
0:10:44,43 --> 0:10:47,6
You'll have medical, dental,
and vision, and blah, blah.


266
0:10:47,6 --> 0:10:51,33
Or you can go try to do the
college, even if you are


267
0:10:51,33 --> 0:10:52,83
smart, or go work
at McDonald's.


268
0:10:52,83 --> 0:10:53,445
What do you want to do?


269
0:10:53,445 --> 0:10:55,66
You go with the mines.


270
0:10:55,66 --> 0:10:57,88
DERRICK BECKLES: Do you think
they're just going to keep


271
0:10:57,88 --> 0:10:58,895
leveling this whole area?


272
0:10:58,895 --> 0:11:0,22
MALE SPEAKER: You're damn
right they will.


273
0:11:0,22 --> 0:11:1,24
MALE SPEAKER: If we
let them, they'll


274
0:11:1,24 --> 0:11:2,12
level this whole place.


275
0:11:2,12 --> 0:11:5,15
You might feel bad about it
because you're worried about


276
0:11:5,15 --> 0:11:5,91
the environment.


277
0:11:5,91 --> 0:11:7,765
But you're still going to cut
the top off this mountain,


278
0:11:7,765 --> 0:11:10,959
because hey, I got to eat.


279
0:11:10,959 --> 0:11:12,209
I've got shit I got to do.


280
0:11:12,209 --> 0:11:18,36



281
0:11:18,36 --> 0:11:19,89
B.I. SAMMONS: You see that
mansion on top of that


282
0:11:19,89 --> 0:11:21,53
mountain yonder?


283
0:11:21,53 --> 0:11:22,96
Can you see that through
your camera?


284
0:11:22,96 --> 0:11:23,64
DERRICK BECKLES: That--


285
0:11:23,64 --> 0:11:24,0
B.I. SAMMONS: That.


286
0:11:24,0 --> 0:11:24,48
DERRICK BECKLES: That
weird-looking thing


287
0:11:24,48 --> 0:11:25,36
on top of the hill?


288
0:11:25,36 --> 0:11:26,74
That's a mansion up there?


289
0:11:26,74 --> 0:11:28,57
B.I. SAMMONS: That's
Don Blankenship's--


290
0:11:28,57 --> 0:11:30,7
one of his mansions
right there.


291
0:11:30,7 --> 0:11:35,98
Because he is knowingly--


292
0:11:35,98 --> 0:11:37,18
I won't say intentionally.


293
0:11:37,18 --> 0:11:40,45
But he is knowingly endangering
the lives of every


294
0:11:40,45 --> 0:11:42,63
man, woman, and child in
this area for miles


295
0:11:42,63 --> 0:11:44,42
and miles and miles.


296
0:11:44,42 --> 0:11:46,54
I don't know how he
sleeps at night.


297
0:11:46,54 --> 0:11:50,6
DERRICK BECKLES: The symbolism
of that, him up there and you


298
0:11:50,6 --> 0:11:52,88
down here, is remarkable.


299
0:11:52,88 --> 0:11:55,93
Just the symbolism of that, and
that he has a bird's-eye


300
0:11:55,93 --> 0:11:58,17
view, potentially watching
everybody down


301
0:11:58,17 --> 0:11:59,44
here get washed away.


302
0:11:59,44 --> 0:12:1,43
B.I. SAMMONS: There's more coal
left in these mountains


303
0:12:1,43 --> 0:12:3,53
than has been mined.


304
0:12:3,53 --> 0:12:6,83
He intended to buy all this
property out, and he's tried,


305
0:12:6,83 --> 0:12:8,41
and he still intends to do it.


306
0:12:8,41 --> 0:12:10,75
Force it done, if necessary,
to move all the


307
0:12:10,75 --> 0:12:11,7
people out of here.


308
0:12:11,7 --> 0:12:14,91
And then start taking these
mountains down, step by step.


309
0:12:14,91 --> 0:12:17,65
I've spent 59 years here, and
I'm not going noplace unless


310
0:12:17,65 --> 0:12:20,99
he washes me off.


311
0:12:20,99 --> 0:12:22,24
I'll die here.


312
0:12:22,24 --> 0:12:25,65



313
0:12:25,65 --> 0:12:28,75
DERRICK BECKLES: Not bad, huh?

[BIRD CHIRPING]

0:12:32,7 --> 0:12:36,57



317
0:12:36,57 --> 0:12:40,33
DONNETTA BLANKENSHIP: I start
getting to talking about Don,


318
0:12:40,33 --> 0:12:42,36
and I start getting
pretty upset, so I


319
0:12:42,36 --> 0:12:44,14
won't say too much.


320
0:12:44,14 --> 0:12:47,45
We have a right and--


321
0:12:47,45 --> 0:12:50,165
especially kids have a right
as much as he does.


322
0:12:50,165 --> 0:12:52,84



323
0:12:52,84 --> 0:12:56,26
Why does people like that
think that they can--


324
0:12:56,26 --> 0:13:0,24



325
0:13:0,24 --> 0:13:1,49
I don't know.


326
0:13:1,49 --> 0:13:4,6



327
0:13:4,6 --> 0:13:11,77
It's like they don't care
if they go ahead and


328
0:13:11,77 --> 0:13:15,3
kill us, and let--


329
0:13:15,3 --> 0:13:18,93
like my kids here, they're
14 and 15.


330
0:13:18,93 --> 0:13:21,368
What's going to happen
to them?


331
0:13:21,368 --> 0:13:23,54
CHRIS HAMILTON: We have
local residents who


332
0:13:23,54 --> 0:13:25,34
have legitimate concerns.


333
0:13:25,34 --> 0:13:28,2
And we have processes and
programs in place to try to


334
0:13:28,2 --> 0:13:30,22
deal with those concerns.


335
0:13:30,22 --> 0:13:36,63
And then we have also another
portion of our population who


336
0:13:36,63 --> 0:13:41,225
simply do not like mining and
would just as soon see it all


337
0:13:41,225 --> 0:13:43,985
be abolished or all go away.


338
0:13:43,985 --> 0:13:44,472
DERRICK BECKLES: Who are they?


339
0:13:44,472 --> 0:13:45,933
It doesn't sound like this--


340
0:13:45,933 --> 0:13:47,4
CHRIS HAMILTON: In a--


341
0:13:47,4 --> 0:13:48,69
DERRICK BECKLES: Who would
those people be, though?


342
0:13:48,69 --> 0:13:50,107
CHRIS HAMILTON: Well,
I saw both in the


343
0:13:50,107 --> 0:13:51,598
committee room today.


344
0:13:51,598 --> 0:13:57,65



345
0:13:57,65 --> 0:14:1,16
DERRICK BECKLES: OK, so we're
at the West Virginia


346
0:14:1,16 --> 0:14:2,23
legislature.


347
0:14:2,23 --> 0:14:5,65
And this is Subcommittee B. And
this hearing's going to


348
0:14:5,65 --> 0:14:7,32
deal with this slurry
injection into the--


349
0:14:7,32 --> 0:14:8,335
MALE SPEAKER: Excuse me.


350
0:14:8,335 --> 0:14:9,82
Sorry.


351
0:14:9,82 --> 0:14:11,7
DERRICK BECKLES:
--mine shafts.


352
0:14:11,7 --> 0:14:13,77



353
0:14:13,77 --> 0:14:17,77
After coal is mined, there's
a lot of leftover rock and


354
0:14:17,77 --> 0:14:20,26
unusable materials, as well
as chemicals from


355
0:14:20,26 --> 0:14:22,54
the coal mining process.


356
0:14:22,54 --> 0:14:25,26
The stuff's called coal slurry,
and it gets pumped


357
0:14:25,26 --> 0:14:27,33
back into the mountain.


358
0:14:27,33 --> 0:14:28,3
It's legal.


359
0:14:28,3 --> 0:14:31,9
The mining companies claim
it's regulated.


360
0:14:31,9 --> 0:14:33,9
And the citizens whose well
water and drinking water is


361
0:14:33,9 --> 0:14:36,82
contaminated claim it's
making them sick.


362
0:14:36,82 --> 0:14:40,285
MALE SPEAKER: Basically what we
do is, when we permit the


363
0:14:40,285 --> 0:14:43,255
sites themselves, we have
a half-mile radius on


364
0:14:43,255 --> 0:14:46,225
groundwater surveys
for the permit.


365
0:14:46,225 --> 0:14:49,69
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think
I'm confused.


366
0:14:49,69 --> 0:15:0,23
Now, you can't inject within 1/4
of a mile of a well or a


367
0:15:0,23 --> 0:15:2,78
municipality, correct?


368
0:15:2,78 --> 0:15:6,86
Well then, I don't know if you
were present at the last


369
0:15:6,86 --> 0:15:7,605
meeting last time.


370
0:15:7,605 --> 0:15:8,382
MALE SPEAKER: No ma'am,
I wasn't.


371
0:15:8,382 --> 0:15:11,48
FEMALE SPEAKER: But we had
several people who brought


372
0:15:11,48 --> 0:15:18,51
samples of their water, which
had huge contaminants in it.


373
0:15:18,51 --> 0:15:21,835
MALE SPEAKER: I think a lot of
people don't understand that


374
0:15:21,835 --> 0:15:25,16
you have to maintain a well
just like you do your car.


375
0:15:25,16 --> 0:15:27,877
A lot of people just turn on
the spigot, and they think


376
0:15:27,877 --> 0:15:32,4
it's going to work for them,
when they have things like


377
0:15:32,4 --> 0:15:35,633
iron hydroxide precipitate and
other minerals built up in


378
0:15:35,633 --> 0:15:36,94
their wells over the years.


379
0:15:36,94 --> 0:15:40,901
And every time I go out on a
well complaint, I tell people,


380
0:15:40,901 --> 0:15:43,51
you need to have a friend at
the local volunteer fire


381
0:15:43,51 --> 0:15:45,4
department come out and
flush your well


382
0:15:45,4 --> 0:15:47,405
after a couple of years.


383
0:15:47,405 --> 0:15:48,35
DWIGHT SIEMIACZKO: Again,
they're going to blame it on


384
0:15:48,35 --> 0:15:48,99
somebody else.


385
0:15:48,99 --> 0:15:50,67
They're not going to
take the blame.


386
0:15:50,67 --> 0:15:55,1
I mean, just like the
far-fetched notion that you're


387
0:15:55,1 --> 0:15:57,542
not cleaning your wells out.


388
0:15:57,542 --> 0:15:58,985
I've never heard of that.


389
0:15:58,985 --> 0:16:1,39
I have never, ever
heard of that.


390
0:16:1,39 --> 0:16:3,29
WAYNE LANHAM: That
guy's an idiot.


391
0:16:3,29 --> 0:16:4,94
You quote me on that.


392
0:16:4,94 --> 0:16:8,72
Tell him to come on over here
too if he wants a piece of it.


393
0:16:8,72 --> 0:16:11,58
Those guys, they make fun
of your common sense.


394
0:16:11,58 --> 0:16:12,67
DWIGHT SIEMIACZKO: Yeah.


395
0:16:12,67 --> 0:16:13,67
WAYNE LANHAM: Common sense.


396
0:16:13,67 --> 0:16:16,54
DWIGHT SIEMIACZKO: And where
is the toxins coming from?


397
0:16:16,54 --> 0:16:23,53
I mean, if you have used your
well for generations and never


398
0:16:23,53 --> 0:16:27,703
had a problem with your well
water, and all of a sudden you


399
0:16:27,703 --> 0:16:32,58
get toxic metals coming
into your well,


400
0:16:32,58 --> 0:16:33,535
where did it come from?


401
0:16:33,535 --> 0:16:36,75
Why wasn't it there
100 years ago?


402
0:16:36,75 --> 0:16:40,78
But it's kind of odd that
someone nearby you is


403
0:16:40,78 --> 0:16:43,59
injecting into the ground the
same thing that's coming into


404
0:16:43,59 --> 0:16:45,78
your well, and your well has
been operational for


405
0:16:45,78 --> 0:16:47,98
generations after generations.


406
0:16:47,98 --> 0:16:50,56
Then to say you're not cleaning
your well out?


407
0:16:50,56 --> 0:16:52,12
B.I. SAMMONS: But
you was there.


408
0:16:52,12 --> 0:16:56,2
You heard those two gentlemen
from the DEP make the


409
0:16:56,2 --> 0:17:1,23
statement that they could prove
that nothing that had


410
0:17:1,23 --> 0:17:4,25
been done in the mining industry
had harmed our


411
0:17:4,25 --> 0:17:5,15
drinking water.


412
0:17:5,15 --> 0:17:8,7
It was just a damned
outright lie.


413
0:17:8,7 --> 0:17:10,68
They're killing people.


414
0:17:10,68 --> 0:17:13,339
And somebody has to do
something to stop it.


415
0:17:13,339 --> 0:17:15,88



416
0:17:15,88 --> 0:17:17,29
DERRICK BECKLES: Protection
agencies are supposed to be


417
0:17:17,29 --> 0:17:18,42
helping you.


418
0:17:18,42 --> 0:17:20,1
Local government.


419
0:17:20,1 --> 0:17:21,31
State government.


420
0:17:21,31 --> 0:17:23,526
Federal government.


421
0:17:23,526 --> 0:17:28,69
How this just goes on for this
long, it boggles my mind.


422
0:17:28,69 --> 0:17:30,8
B.I. SAMMONS: Politics.


423
0:17:30,8 --> 0:17:31,17
I'm waiting.


424
0:17:31,17 --> 0:17:34,53
It's been a year and a half
now, almost two years.


425
0:17:34,53 --> 0:17:37,98
I'm still waiting on a man
that works for the DEP.


426
0:17:37,98 --> 0:17:41,825
He's in charge of the gas well
mining operation in the state


427
0:17:41,825 --> 0:17:42,72
of West Virginia.


428
0:17:42,72 --> 0:17:45,35
I'm still waiting for a
call back from him.


429
0:17:45,35 --> 0:17:46,3
DERRICK BECKLES: You've
got to be kidding.


430
0:17:46,3 --> 0:17:47,49
B.I. SAMMONS: No,
I'm not kidding.


431
0:17:47,49 --> 0:17:50,21
And I've got the number of calls
that I called, and who I


432
0:17:50,21 --> 0:17:51,94
called, and who I talked to.


433
0:17:51,94 --> 0:17:54,43
You truly have no idea what
goes on around here.


434
0:17:54,43 --> 0:17:57,51
The things I want to say to you,
it'll come to my mind,


435
0:17:57,51 --> 0:17:58,12
then I'll forget it.


436
0:17:58,12 --> 0:18:0,145
But the doctor from New York
that called me and told me


437
0:18:0,145 --> 0:18:1,87
said, I'm surprised you can
talk, that's how much lead


438
0:18:1,87 --> 0:18:3,85
that you've got in your brain.


439
0:18:3,85 --> 0:18:6,12
DERRICK BECKLES: Could you
explain to me how this is


440
0:18:6,12 --> 0:18:8,472
affecting your family, then?


441
0:18:8,472 --> 0:18:10,29
Like physically?


442
0:18:10,29 --> 0:18:14,73
B.I. SAMMONS: Brittany,
come in here.


443
0:18:14,73 --> 0:18:15,23
Tell me.


444
0:18:15,23 --> 0:18:16,24
You went to the doctor today.


445
0:18:16,24 --> 0:18:17,676
What did the doctor say?


446
0:18:17,676 --> 0:18:18,37
BRITTANY SAMMONS: Nothing.


447
0:18:18,37 --> 0:18:20,105
B.I. SAMMONS: What did he say
about the knot on your cheek?


448
0:18:20,105 --> 0:18:23,118



449
0:18:23,118 --> 0:18:24,73
BRITTANY SAMMONS: That it
could be infection.


450
0:18:24,73 --> 0:18:27,36
It could be a fluid sac,
or it could be a cyst.


451
0:18:27,36 --> 0:18:28,36
He didn't know.


452
0:18:28,36 --> 0:18:30,71
B.I. SAMMONS: So what
do you got to do?


453
0:18:30,71 --> 0:18:31,163
BRITTANY SAMMONS: Nothing.


454
0:18:31,163 --> 0:18:33,735
He gave me antibiotics
and sent me home.


455
0:18:33,735 --> 0:18:35,34
B.I. SAMMONS: He don't want
you to go see nobody else?


456
0:18:35,34 --> 0:18:37,716
What kind of antibiotics
did he give you?


457
0:18:37,716 --> 0:18:40,0
BRITTANY SAMMONS: I've
never heard of them.


458
0:18:40,0 --> 0:18:40,87
B.I. SAMMONS: And I've
got a little boy.


459
0:18:40,87 --> 0:18:42,23
He's nine years old.


460
0:18:42,23 --> 0:18:46,31
From the time he was a child,
he's been on antibiotics more


461
0:18:46,31 --> 0:18:49,76
than half of his life because
of this damn water.


462
0:18:49,76 --> 0:18:53,53
And we didn't know what
was causing it.


463
0:18:53,53 --> 0:18:55,63
Right there is what I have
to take on a daily


464
0:18:55,63 --> 0:18:59,2
basis to stay alive.


465
0:18:59,2 --> 0:19:2,91
Now, that's almost
hard to believe.


466
0:19:2,91 --> 0:19:3,74
DERRICK BECKLES: Can I
see those, please?


467
0:19:3,74 --> 0:19:4,99
B.I. SAMMONS: Yeah.


468
0:19:4,99 --> 0:19:11,34



469
0:19:11,34 --> 0:19:13,99
And I'm not going to be here
long, because you cannot live


470
0:19:13,99 --> 0:19:16,35
with that many chemicals
in your body.


471
0:19:16,35 --> 0:19:17,11
DERRICK BECKLES: How does
that make you feel,


472
0:19:17,11 --> 0:19:19,71
saying that out loud?


473
0:19:19,71 --> 0:19:21,18
B.I. SAMMONS: Mister, I'm just
telling you the truth.


474
0:19:21,18 --> 0:19:22,12
DERRICK BECKLES: I know.


475
0:19:22,12 --> 0:19:25,11
B.I. SAMMONS: I'm telling you
what the doctor told me.


476
0:19:25,11 --> 0:19:27,11
Don't plan on being here
long, having to take


477
0:19:27,11 --> 0:19:29,678
that kind of medicine.


478
0:19:29,678 --> 0:19:31,79
I've got stacks of
these tablets.


479
0:19:31,79 --> 0:19:33,62
This is the amount of medicine
that I take.


480
0:19:33,62 --> 0:19:34,61
And I have to take them.


481
0:19:34,61 --> 0:19:36,42
I don't take them because
I want to take them.


482
0:19:36,42 --> 0:19:39,81
I want to be alive for
that little boy.


483
0:19:39,81 --> 0:19:41,716
DERRICK BECKLES: This is what
they claim isn't happening.


484
0:19:41,716 --> 0:19:43,606
B.I. SAMMONS: Yeah, the
DEP and the EPA.


485
0:19:43,606 --> 0:19:44,12
DERRICK BECKLES: The DEP.


486
0:19:44,12 --> 0:19:45,5
The EPA.


487
0:19:45,5 --> 0:19:45,96
The mining companies.


488
0:19:45,96 --> 0:19:48,95
The everybody who's not
living in these areas.


489
0:19:48,95 --> 0:19:50,23
Everybody's who's
not a miner are


490
0:19:50,23 --> 0:19:51,15
claiming this isn't happening.


491
0:19:51,15 --> 0:19:51,98
B.I. SAMMONS: This
doesn't happen.


492
0:19:51,98 --> 0:19:52,88
That's right.


493
0:19:52,88 --> 0:19:56,52
DERRICK BECKLES: And that this
is your imagination.


494
0:19:56,52 --> 0:19:58,41
What do you think every night
before you go to bed?


495
0:19:58,41 --> 0:20:0,726
B.I. SAMMONS: You pray
before you go to bed.


496
0:20:0,726 --> 0:20:2,83
And you just ask God to take
care of your family.


497
0:20:2,83 --> 0:20:3,64
That's all you can do.


498
0:20:3,64 --> 0:20:8,53
Because man has done done
the damage to the Earth.


499
0:20:8,53 --> 0:20:13,5
And I don't see how man can
correct what's been done.


500
0:20:13,5 --> 0:20:14,54
God can handle this.


501
0:20:14,54 --> 0:20:15,85
He will.


502
0:20:15,85 --> 0:20:18,43
When the right time comes, he
will do what has to be done.


503
0:20:18,43 --> 0:22:18,43
