0:0:0,3 --> 0:0:1,67
SAM BARCLAY: Ladies and
gentlemen, boys and girls,


3
0:0:1,67 --> 0:0:2,98
hello and welcome.


4
0:0:2,98 --> 0:0:7,66
This is the Smoke's Poutinerie
third annual World Poutine


5
0:0:7,66 --> 0:0:8,23
Eating Championships.


6
0:0:8,23 --> 0:0:11,69
There is no bigger stage
in all of world sports.


7
0:0:11,69 --> 0:0:12,94
No one denies this.


8
0:0:12,94 --> 0:0:16,66



9
0:0:16,66 --> 0:0:17,82
My name is Sam Barclay.


10
0:0:17,82 --> 0:0:19,34
I'm from Major League Eating.


11
0:0:19,34 --> 0:0:22,58
We are the world body that
governs and sanctions all


12
0:0:22,58 --> 0:0:23,66
stomach centric sports.


13
0:0:23,66 --> 0:0:28,14
And coming up in a matter of
moments, on that very stage,


14
0:0:28,14 --> 0:0:31,37
is the Smoke's Poutinerie third
annual World Poutine


15
0:0:31,37 --> 0:0:32,28
Eating Championships.


16
0:0:32,28 --> 0:0:35,48
There is no bigger stage
in all of world sports.


17
0:0:35,48 --> 0:0:36,85
TIM JANUS: My name
is Tim Janus.


18
0:0:36,85 --> 0:0:39,37
They call me Eater X. I'm
the number three ranked


19
0:0:39,37 --> 0:0:41,76
competitive eater on the planet,
and I'm here for the


20
0:0:41,76 --> 0:0:45,6
Smoke's Poutinerie World Poutine
Eating Championship.


21
0:0:45,6 --> 0:0:48,85
I didn't do a lot for this
contest, mainly because we


22
0:0:48,85 --> 0:0:51,42
don't have a Smoke's Poutinerie
in New York City.


23
0:0:51,42 --> 0:0:53,6
If you're going to practice,
which we don't do very much


24
0:0:53,6 --> 0:0:56,6
anyways, it really helps to
have the exact food you're


25
0:0:56,6 --> 0:0:57,96
going to be eating
in the contest.


26
0:0:57,96 --> 0:0:59,71
I think we're going to
be duking it out.


27
0:0:59,71 --> 0:1:3,0
It's a capacity contest, but
speed is the name of the game.


28
0:1:3,0 --> 0:1:5,7
It's a very quick food, so at
the end it's going to come


29
0:1:5,7 --> 0:1:7,0
down to who has more
room left.


30
0:1:7,0 --> 0:1:11,16
And we're all pretty big
eaters in that sense.


31
0:1:11,16 --> 0:1:11,23
JIM REEVES: Hi.


32
0:1:11,23 --> 0:1:13,17
My name is Jim Reeves from
Buffalo, New York.


33
0:1:13,17 --> 0:1:15,1
They just call me Buffalo
Jim Reeves.


34
0:1:15,1 --> 0:1:16,2
I love this contest.


35
0:1:16,2 --> 0:1:17,16
I've done it all three years.


36
0:1:17,16 --> 0:1:18,99
This will be my third
year doing it.


37
0:1:18,99 --> 0:1:20,71
I'm currently ranked number
18 in the world.


38
0:1:20,71 --> 0:1:22,74
I'm the current world record
holder over watermelon.


39
0:1:22,74 --> 0:1:25,56
I've eaten 13.22 pounds of
watermelon in 15 minutes.


40
0:1:25,56 --> 0:1:28,23
I'm pork rind eating champion of
the world, 50 hamburgers in


41
0:1:28,23 --> 0:1:31,2
8 minutes and 100 whole
jalapenos in 8 minutes.


42
0:1:31,2 --> 0:1:33,76
The first National Buffalo Wing
Festival, 10 years ago,


43
0:1:33,76 --> 0:1:35,4
my brother-in-law was in
from out of town, he


44
0:1:35,4 --> 0:1:36,31
dared me to do it.


45
0:1:36,31 --> 0:1:36,71
I did it.


46
0:1:36,71 --> 0:1:37,82
I did pretty well.


47
0:1:37,82 --> 0:1:39,78
Poutine is one of the most
difficult foods to eat,


48
0:1:39,78 --> 0:1:40,63
absolutely.


49
0:1:40,63 --> 0:1:42,84
People don't think so, because
everybody loves french fries,


50
0:1:42,84 --> 0:1:44,88
but the reality of it is
they're really pasty.


51
0:1:44,88 --> 0:1:47,68
And when you try eating them
fast, all that dryness and all


52
0:1:47,68 --> 0:1:49,71
that pastiness starts to gum
up your mouth, just like


53
0:1:49,71 --> 0:1:50,68
peanut butter does.


54
0:1:50,68 --> 0:1:52,79
So it's actually more difficult
than eating hot dogs


55
0:1:52,79 --> 0:1:53,41
or hamburgers.


56
0:1:53,41 --> 0:1:56,76
BOB SHOUDT: My name's Bob
Shoudt, Notorious BOB.


57
0:1:56,76 --> 0:1:58,97
Most people go for
the gold stuff.


58
0:1:58,97 --> 0:2:1,16
This is real pine, though,
I went for pine.


59
0:2:1,16 --> 0:2:3,35
I've always been eating in
eating contests all my life.


60
0:2:3,35 --> 0:2:4,95
I'm 45 years old.


61
0:2:4,95 --> 0:2:8,37
Once you start getting money
to eat, you keep eating and


62
0:2:8,37 --> 0:2:9,81
keep getting money.


63
0:2:9,81 --> 0:2:11,8
This is a cool trophy here.


64
0:2:11,8 --> 0:2:13,1
So you want to get your picture


65
0:2:13,1 --> 0:2:14,48
taken with that trophy.


66
0:2:14,48 --> 0:2:15,13
It kicks ass.


67
0:2:15,13 --> 0:2:18,26
You've seen the trophy,
you know it kicks ass.


68
0:2:18,26 --> 0:2:19,1
LARELL MARIE MELE: My
name is Larell Marie


69
0:2:19,1 --> 0:2:20,81
The Real Deal Mele.


70
0:2:20,81 --> 0:2:23,98
I'm ranked number 30 in
the world of MLE.


71
0:2:23,98 --> 0:2:26,78
I think now that women are
more aware of competitive


72
0:2:26,78 --> 0:2:29,14
eating it's becoming a
lot more equal field.


73
0:2:29,14 --> 0:2:30,37
It's not just the men anymore.


74
0:2:30,37 --> 0:2:34,8
The women are having equal
opportunity and awareness.


75
0:2:34,8 --> 0:2:36,84
So it's not become disgusting
anymore.


76
0:2:36,84 --> 0:2:38,24
It's something cool
to be doing.


77
0:2:38,24 --> 0:2:39,86
And especially if you
can beat some of the


78
0:2:39,86 --> 0:2:41,25
guys, it's even better.


79
0:2:41,25 --> 0:2:43,11
MICAH COLLINS: They call me Wing
Kong, or the Candyman.


80
0:2:43,11 --> 0:2:45,34
I am from Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania.


81
0:2:45,34 --> 0:2:46,915
I'm 13th in the world
right now.


82
0:2:46,915 --> 0:2:49,68
It started as a bad joke
and a lot of beer.


83
0:2:49,68 --> 0:2:51,72
I actually hold the world
baked bean record--


84
0:2:51,72 --> 0:2:54,44
5 pounds, 4 ounces
in 58 seconds.


85
0:2:54,44 --> 0:2:57,875
This morning I did about nine
pounds of cabbage with about a


86
0:2:57,875 --> 0:3:1,825
gallon of water, so that flushed
everything through and


87
0:3:1,825 --> 0:3:2,55
I feel great.


88
0:3:2,55 --> 0:3:2,74
I'm ready to go.


89
0:3:2,74 --> 0:3:4,8
I'm stretched out and ready.


90
0:3:4,8 --> 0:3:13,523



91
0:3:13,523 --> 0:3:16,8
SAM BARCLAY: Let the
contest begin.


92
0:3:16,8 --> 0:3:53,82



93
0:3:53,82 --> 0:3:56,321
TIM JANUS: I tied for
second today.


94
0:3:56,321 --> 0:3:57,14
I'm happy.


95
0:3:57,14 --> 0:3:59,45
I feel like I could eat more.


96
0:3:59,45 --> 0:4:0,65
It's great poutine.


97
0:4:0,65 --> 0:4:3,24
I was a little conservative with
the water, so I have a


98
0:4:3,24 --> 0:4:4,17
lot of space left.


99
0:4:4,17 --> 0:4:5,56
But I'm happy with
the results.


100
0:4:5,56 --> 0:4:6,68
It was a good contest.


101
0:4:6,68 --> 0:4:7,59
BOB SHOUDT: Second place.


102
0:4:7,59 --> 0:4:8,41
I'm proud of that.


103
0:4:8,41 --> 0:4:9,2
It's a good contest.


104
0:4:9,2 --> 0:4:12,35
I really wanted to be next to
that trophy at the end, but


105
0:4:12,35 --> 0:4:14,4
it's something to shoot
for next year year.


106
0:4:14,4 --> 0:4:15,53
I have to stay hungry
and focused and come


107
0:4:15,53 --> 0:4:16,769
back strong next year.


108
0:4:16,769 --> 0:4:17,89
JOEY CHESTNUT: I'm Joey
Chestnut, world champion


109
0:4:17,89 --> 0:4:20,0
competitive eater, ranked
number one in the world.


110
0:4:20,0 --> 0:4:22,35
Today I was able to come out
champion of the poutine eating


111
0:4:22,35 --> 0:4:25,61
championships and dominate the
field and take home the


112
0:4:25,61 --> 0:4:27,4
poutine eating title
to California.


113
0:4:27,4 --> 0:4:30,83
Today I was just eating
with my left hand.


114
0:4:30,83 --> 0:4:33,2
If I had to drink something I
would drink with my right.


115
0:4:33,2 --> 0:4:34,82
But I'm left handed, so I was
doing all my real eating work


116
0:4:34,82 --> 0:4:36,305
with my left hand.


117
0:4:36,305 --> 0:4:38,21
And I just try to get
into a rhythm.


118
0:4:38,21 --> 0:4:40,42
You get into a rhythm, breathe,
swallow, do the same


119
0:4:40,42 --> 0:4:41,64
thing over and over again.


120
0:4:41,64 --> 0:4:44,17
I had somebody behind me,
yelling at me, coaching me,


121
0:4:44,17 --> 0:4:45,41
yelling at me every time
I slowed down,


122
0:4:45,41 --> 0:4:46,86
which always helps.


123
0:4:46,86 --> 0:4:49,46
Besides some awesome trophies,
I'm walking away with two


124
0:4:49,46 --> 0:4:50,71
grand cash.


125
0:4:50,71 --> 0:4:52,8



126
0:4:52,8 --> 0:4:54,62
Even if there was no cash
involved, I'd love to come


127
0:4:54,62 --> 0:4:55,87
here and win it again.


128
0:4:55,87 --> 0:6:55,87
