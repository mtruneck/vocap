###14 (There Must Be An Angel)
###17 Morning, darling, I've made you breakfast. Did you sleep all right?
###21 Erm... yeah. Yeah.
###24 I had a really weird dream.
###26 Did you, babe?
###28 I dreamt you chucked me and I moved in with a girl I hardly knew.
###31 - I chucked you? - Yeah.
###33 - As if ! - Yeah !
###36 - Aarrghh ! - Tim !
###38 Shit !
###41 Aarrghh !
###52 Shit.
###54 Son of a bitch !
###57 (The All Seeing Eye: The Beat Goes On)
###86 Tim? I'm really trying to work.
###89 - What you telling me for? - Well, I...
###91 I can't concentrate with this mess, I think it's time we unpacked.
###95 - I have unpacked. - Have you?
###107 <i>I'm not talking about your room, I'm talking about this room.</i>
###110 This is a shared area, you've got stuff in here too.
###113 But it's under your stuff. Soon as you clear up, I can do the rest.
###116 - I've got work to do. - So you keep saying.
###119 I haven't seen you sit behind that typewriter for longer than two minutes.
###122 - What do you mean? - I mean... I think you're avoiding work.
###128 Oh, really?
###133 I just think we should draw up some kind of a rota. All right?
###138 - All right. - We need to establish domestic equilibrium.
###142 - OK. - We need to get used to each other.
###144 We don't know each other that well, do we ?
###153 No.
###154 In the interests of making this cohabitation charade work for us,
###158 we should do everything we can
###160 to try and make day-to-day life as easy and enjoyable as possible.
###164 All right ! Look, I'm agreeing with you.
###168 Right. I'll get on with it, then.
###170 - All righty. - OK.
###176 Right.
###180 I'm going to divide it into kitchen, living room and...
###185 Right, then.
###188 (Tchaikovsky: Piano Concerto No 1)
###239 Hey.
###241 It's OK, it's me.
###243 - Gosh. - How's it going ?
###245 Fine. How long have I been going ?
###249 - Two and a half minutes. - Shit !
###252 - Listen, I've got an idea. - What ?
###254 - Something I think you're gonna like. - I've got to be getting on.
###256 It's important, Daisy. Trust me.
###264 Hm. I'm glad we did that.
###267 We had to really.
###269 It was inevitable. I'm just glad we did it sooner rather than later.
###272 I think there would have been a hell of a lot of tension if we'd left it any longer.
###276 You're telling me.
###282 What shall we do now ?
###285 I think we should descale the teapot.
###288 - You filthy bitch. - You love it.
###303 Here we go. Here we go.
###315 Tim, what are you doing ?
###317 We're having a sale on X-Men comics at the shop.
###320 Bilbo wants me to draw a picture of Wolverine slashing prices with his adamantium claws.
###325 - I'm also doing a poster... - All right !
###352 Oh ! Oh, my glasses ! Where are my glasses ?
###357 Oh.
###364 Right. Yes !
###367 Let's have a party ! Let's have a house-warming party.
###370 - What ? - It'd be great !
###372 I could make invitations out of plastic and tinfoil.
###376 We can invite Marsha and Brian.
###379 - Yeah, all right. When ? - Tonight ! Let's have it tonight !
###382 Tonight ? ! That's a bit short notice.
###385 It'll be great, I'll call all my mates, it'll be like Warhol's Factory -
###389 artists, writers, musicians, dossers off the street,
###391 all interacting and relaxing in our pad, the new hub of north London.
###395 The cutting edge ! You know ?
###397 We could have a glitter ball ! I could make one out of tinfoil !
###400 - All right. - Yes !
###403 - But your room's the coat room. - OK.
###407 Get this old thing out the way.
###409 ? Party, um-by-ay, party, um-by-ay...
###415 <i>If we have it, they will come,</i>
###418 I said yes.
###431 Leave me alone !
###433 Holiday from what ? We'd all have a bleedin' holiday, wouldn't we ?
###437 Oh, hello. Everything all right ?
###440 Teenagers, eh ?
###442 She's not a teenager, she's the devil in an A cup !
###448 Well, us amiable bunch of 20-somethings, us harmless happy-go-lucky lot,
###453 we're having a party tonight, very small, very quiet.
###456 We wondered if you and Amber wanted to come and throw coleslaw at each other.
###460 She won't come, she's having a party of her own up here tonight.
###464 - You sure you want me there ? - Oh, yeah ! We'd love it if you came.
###468 Will Brian be there ?
###470 I hope so, Tim's just gone to ask him.
###473 - Do you like him ? - He's all right.
###476 Good legs.
###486 - Who is it ? - Father Christmas.
###492 - Oh, it's you. - Who'd you think it was ?
###495 Daisy wants a house-warming party tonight
###498 so she sent me to ask you if you want to come.
###501 - Is Marsha coming ? - I don't know, she's gone up to ask her.
###504 What's the deal with you and Marsha ?
###507 - You know about the deal ? - What ? !
###510 I'm busy, Tim, painting a triptych.
###513 - Oh, yeah, what's it called ? - Bad Sandwich.
###515 - Really ? - Yes.
###517 It's a piece about violence in its immediacy, the instancy of the event,
###521 a synchronic rendering of three explosive, aggressive expressions.
###528 - There'll be girls at the party. - Really ?
###530 - Yes. - Mm.
###533 All right, mate ?
###535 I don't think we're gonna need any security, it's gonna be very low-key.
###539 Well... Yeah, well, bring one. Bring the Baretta. Yeah.
###543 No, bring the Glock 17, yeah, that's my favourite.
###547 OK, I'll see you later. Bye. Where have you been ?
###550 Talking to Marsha. What's a Glock 17 ?
###553 It's a gun. You've been talking to Marsha for four hours ?
###556 Did you know her husband once drummed for Status Quo ? Who's bringing a gun ?
###559 Mike. Is that what you've been talking about for four hours ?
###562 Why is Mike bringing a gun to our party ?
###565 Security. Do you think she suspects we're not a couple ?
###568 I don't think so. Why do we need security ? We're not organising a rave.
###572 It's not that kind of security, it's like a gonk, a troll, a Linus blanket, you know.
###577 Do we still have to hold hands in the corridor ?
###580 - Not if you don't want to. - I didn't say that.
###584 We could probably cut down on the fake sex noises.
###590 Shame.
###591 My friend Twist is coming. Oh, you're gonna love her, she's brilliant !
###595 She's brilliant, really intelligent, funny, talented, funny, funny, interesting.
###599 Forget all that. Is she fit ?
###601 She ran half a marathon for Fashion Aid.
###603 Have you managed to rustle up any media types ?
###606 - Oh, yeah. - Who ?
###608 - The paperboy. - Smooth.
###611 What about you ?
###612 What with the Skaterama at the East Finchley Uberbowl
###614 and the Tripods convention in Swindon, most of my friends are otherwise engaged.
###618 Don't worry, Tim, it's gonna be great.
###622 I'm just gonna go and try on a few outfits.
###628 - Hello ? - Oh, hi. Is Daisy there, please ?
###632 Hang on, she's just getting her clothes on. Daisy ! It's your boyfriend !
###635 Shh ! Hi, Richard.
###638 - What did he mean by that ? - 'By what ? '
###641 About you getting your clothes on ?
###643 We're having a house-warming, I was trying to pick some clothes.
###647 - Oh, I see. - 'How's it going ? '
###653 What's that ? !
###654 Daisy, I can hear sex noise !
###657 Shh ! Not now !
###682 I see it as a tribute
###685 to Christo, the artist.
###688 I see it as a waste
###690 of Baco, the foil.
###695 Party !
###697 OK, whoo ! Whoo !
###702 Music. Music ! We need warm-up music !
###705 Warm-up music, warm-up music.
###707 Party tape. Here we go.
###711 ? Hot dog, jumping frog
###714 ? Alma Cookies
###718 ? Hot dog, jumping frog
###720 Come on !
###726 Ooh, try not to eat too much, there's quite a lot of people coming. Yeah ?
###734 Hey, Brian, do you want some ice ?
###736 Come on ! Come on ! Come and get some ice, go on !
###741 Oh, God, I don't understand this !
###744 I defrosted this earlier. It just eats up electricity and frosts up really quickly.
###749 I put half a Magnum in there this afternoon, I can't get it out now.
###753 - It's almost as if it's... - Self-aware.
###757 Yeah.
###769 - Hi, Mike. - Tim.
###771 - Hello. - Oh, hi. We're looking for the party.
###776 - Er, yeah, well, come on it. - Are you Amber's dad ?
###779 It's upstairs.
###785 - You might have missed the puppet show. - Fuck off !
###789 - What did you say ? - They said "Fuck off."
###791 I know what they said, Mike !
###793 Little cow. Standing there with her purple hair and her alcopops, giving it all that, "Hello."
###799 Sorry, this is my best friend, Mike.
###801 Hello, Mike. I'm Daisy, nice to meet you.
###805 How you doin' ? Sergeant Mike Watts, TA. It's the longest way up, shortest way down.
###808 - Oh, you've brought something ? - Yeah, I've got a... land mine.
###813 Oh, right, OK. I'll just put that somewhere safe.
###824 Artist, writer...
###828 - Er, Mike. - You never said Amber was having a party.
###831 Yeah. We'll show them.
###835 (Prefab Sprout: King Of Rock And Roll)
###837 What is this ? ! This is rubbish !
###839 We should be listening to firm, young melodies, kicking tunes, thumping bass.
###844 God, I sound so stupid !
###854 Twist ! Hi !
###856 - Oh ! - Daisy ! Oh !
###859 Don't you look nice ? Bit of a midriff show !
###863 - Yeah. - Big's in this season. Good for you.
###869 (Huey Lewis And The News : The Power of Love)
###877 Everyone, this is my friend, Twist.
###880 - Hi. - Hi.
###882 Hey, Twista, what can I getcha ?
###884 I shouldn't really drink because of the yeast, but go on, I'll be naughty and have a spritzer.
###889 Is there anywhere I can hang my wrap ?
###891 - Daisy's room's the coat room. - Right.
###894 She's great, isn't she ? She's great, she's so funny !
###901 Oh !
###903 So, erm, you two have got separate rooms ?
###905 - No. - Yes.
###907 - Yes. - No.
###908 - We had an argument. - We had a fight, Daisy snores.
###910 - I snore ! - Like a pig !
###914 - He's like a big sweaty pig ! - Ha, you're the pig ! I'm not the snoring one.
###918 That's why we sleep separately.
###921 - That's right, yeah. We're not a couple. - Hey ! Hey !
###923 Y-you ! Funny. That is good.
###926 No, the fact is...
###928 We're not a couple. We lied to get the flat.
###930 - But we really like it here. - We really like it here.
###932 - So, please, whatever you do, don't tell... - Marsha !
###936 - Hello. - Hi !
###939 It's me, the weirdo from upstairs.
###942 Oh !
###945 - Am I late ? - No !
###950 - Hello, Brian. - Hello.
###953 Erm, Twist...
###957 Marsha, this is Twist. She's in fashion.
###961 Er, Marsha's... a landlady.
###965 - Hello. - Hi ! Interesting outfit.
###968 Oh, thanks. Thought I'd make an effort.
###970 Mm, yeah. I can really see what you tried to do.
###974 Yeah. Cheers.
###977 And that's Mike.
###979 Er... and... he's... a Mike.
###986 - Where shall I put me coat ? - Er... ?
###989 Don't worry.
###990 I'll put it in Tim and Daisy's room.
###994 (The Magnificent Seven)
###1005 (J Geils Band: Centerfold)
###1016 If I was you, I wouldn't care. You look great like that.
###1020 You can just eat what you like and you don't care if you get fat.
###1022 I wish I didn't have to be so picky.
###1024 You can't trust them in that organic-produce shop. It's con after con.
###1029 That's it, isn't it ? Con after con.
###1031 The evil hand of capitalism dons a gardening glove
###1034 to take our money in the name of global awareness.
###1037 The woman in there has really squinty eyes, stinks of garlic and looks like a turd in a wig.
###1041 You'd think with the money she's raking in she could afford a new hairbrush.
###1046 A T-shirt or something.
###1049 Anyway. It's quite a nice flat.
###1052 It'll be better when you've unpacked and cleaned up a little.
###1056 This is it, actually.
###1058 Tim seems nice and friendly, doesn't he ?
###1065 Come on, now, Daisy. Stop feeling like a big, fat, ugly failure.
###1070 Everything's going to be fine. Hm ? Hey ?
###1074 Good.
###1082 So, what do you do, Brian ?
###1085 - He paints. - Oh, yes ? What sort of thing ?
###1088 Erm...
###1090 - Tell her, Brian. - Anger.
###1097 Pain.
###1101 Fear.
###1105 Aggression.
###1109 I know exactly what you mean.
###1115 - Do you ? - Yes.
###1117 Ooh, Timewarp !
###1119 Ooh, Timewarp !
###1121 Oh, Timewarp ? !
###1123 Let's do the Timewarp again !
###1126 ? Jump to the left
###1128 -  ? And then a step to the right... - Bloody hell, this party is so rubbish.
###1131 - Is it ? - You were there.
###1133 Providing much-needed door security.
###1135 - Any problems ? - No.
###1136 Sorry. Do you think we're getting old, Mike ?
###1139 Everyone gets old, Tim. Everyone except my cousin Adam.
###1141 What's so special about your cousin Adam ?
###1142 - He is getting younger. - Bastard. What are we gonna do ?
###1145 There's nothing we can do, the government know.
###1148 <i>Not about Adam ! I'm talking about what we're gonna do now !</i>
###1150 Wanna go into your party ?
###1152 They were playing the Timewarp, I hate the Timewarp !
###1154 - Daisy likes it. - So what ? ! I hate it !
###1157 It's boil-in-the-bag perversion for sexually repressed accountants
###1160 and students with too many posters of Betty Blue, the Blues Brothers and Big Blue
###1164 on their blue bloody walls !
###1166 - It's just a song. - I don't care ! I hate it, I don't wanna hear it !
###1170 I don't wanna hear it at a party, least of all a party I'm supposed to be throwing !
###1173 Oh, my God, Tim ! Control yourself, please.
###1177 - (Don McLean: American Pie) - We're all in, like, the arts and the media.
###1182 I'm writing a screenplay at the moment.
###1185 Called, erm...
###1187 Guacamole, erm, Window.
###1190 I think you'd be good for the lead, actually.
###1194 Do you want one ?
###1197 No, I'd better not.
###1199 Go on, then, I'll have a half. I'll have a half.
###1202 They're mints.
###1204 Yeah. I'll have a half... mint.
###1214 - Ow ! - Go !
###1215 Ow ! Ow !
###1218 Ow !
###1219 Will you stop it ? !
###1223 I mean it.
###1227 I'm sorry you didn't get into the army, Mike, it's not my fault.
###1231 - Even if it was, that was a long time ago. - I still remember it, Tim-Tim.
###1244 Hey ! No time for that now ! What we gonna do ?
###1246 - We could slap each other about a bit more. - I don't feel like it.
###1249 We could go to Amber's party.
###1252 - What ? - Amber, the girl upstairs.
###1254 Are you suggesting we crash Amber's party ?
###1256 I don't know, it'll just be a load of teenage girls.
###1260 And that's a good thing !
###1264 (Spandau Ballet: True)
###1287 Have we got any more booze ? We need some more beers.
###1290 What you doing ?
###1294 - Who are you ? - I'm the paperboy.
###1297 - Daisy, he's got a brace. - I thought it was a piercing.
###1300 Urgh ! Look, come upstairs, it's brilliant, it's 2.30am, it's just got started.
###1305 Oh... I dunno.
###1307 - There's things up there you won't believe. - What about the party ? What about the dips ?
###1311 That's what I mean, Daisy, don't you see ?
###1313 - What ? - Dips, the Timewarp, paperboys.
###1316 Not many people came but you're having a good time, aren't you ?
###1323 It's a party ! It's just a laugh !
###1326 It's not a laugh ! It's not even a party.
###1330 Daisy, there'll be a time for dips. OK ? But this isn't it.
###1335 He's right, Daisy.
###1337 There's nothing for us here any more.
###1340 Join us  !
###1343 Yes, come on, Daisy.
###1346 Join us  !
###1355 All right.
###1380 Look at them. They're all so thin.
###1437 Hello.
