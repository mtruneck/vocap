Hello, my name is Andrew WK.


3
0:0:2,26 --> 0:0:5,63
And I'm joining you from the
Vice offices this holiday


4
0:0:5,63 --> 0:0:10,32
season with my wonderful friend
Lil Bub to appeal to


5
0:0:10,32 --> 0:0:14,46
your sense of kindness
and generosity.


6
0:0:14,46 --> 0:0:18,4
Now Lil Bub, of course,
is a star cat.


7
0:0:18,4 --> 0:0:22,19
For many of her fans, Lil
Bub's face and demeanor


8
0:0:22,19 --> 0:0:24,82
represent kindness
and positivity


9
0:0:24,82 --> 0:0:27,21
in the face of adversity.

0:0:27,21 --> 0:0:30,723
She also snorted a few
times in reverse.


11
0:0:30,723 --> 0:0:32,509
Why would you do that?


12
0:0:32,509 --> 0:0:35,31



13
0:0:35,31 --> 0:0:39,1
Now we all understand that the
winter holiday season is one


14
0:0:39,1 --> 0:0:41,58
of the most fun times
to party.


15
0:0:41,58 --> 0:0:45,37
And in that spirit of inclusion
and warmth, we ask


16
0:0:45,37 --> 0:0:48,41
you to donate to your
local animal shelter


17
0:0:48,41 --> 0:0:50,29
this holiday season.

0:0:50,43 --> 0:0:57,47
I'm dreaming of a
white Christian.


20
0:0:57,47 --> 0:1:1,85
As precious as Lil Bub is, she
takes a lot of care, a lot of


21
0:1:1,85 --> 0:1:3,54
resources, and a
lot of energy.


22
0:1:3,54 --> 0:1:7,97
So find it in your heart to
donate, have a happy holiday,


23
0:1:7,97 --> 0:1:12,4
and enjoy the preciousness
of this beast.


24
0:1:12,4 --> 0:1:14,89
How do you even exist?


25
0:1:14,89 --> 0:1:16,15
How tender is your paw?


26
0:1:16,15 --> 0:1:21,23



27
0:1:21,23 --> 0:1:23,43
Lil Bub.
