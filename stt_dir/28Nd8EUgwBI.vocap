###0 Inca built palaces, storehouses and castles in the tall mountains.
###2 In their realm of six million people
###4 they rely on manpower to transport stones without animals or the wheel.
###10 And the energy for that is provided by another amazing food source.
###18 They are famed for their gold, but their true treasure is less glamorous.
###30 A tuber, native to the Americas and unknown in Europe,
###34 cultivated here some eight thousand years ago in the region around lake Titicaca,
###40 in today's Peru and Bolivia,
###42 twelve thousand five hundred feet up.
###46 What his now a staple food in Europe was an American invention.
###57 By the year 1491
###59 the Inca grow thousands of varieties,
###62 domesticated from wild ancestors.
###65 Some poisonous,
###68 some even carnivorous.
###77 They preserve the tuber by meshing them into a substance called "chuño".
###82 After harvest potatoes are spread on straw and left out to freeze at night.
###88 During the day they are exposed to the sun.
###91 Trampling them eliminates water and allows them to dry.
###95 Chuño can be stored for ten years providing excellent insurance against possible crop failures.
###105 The inca carved step-like terraces into the mountainsides,
###108 to stop the soil eroding and create a flat surface for their crops.
###113 Terraces absorb more sunlight than steep slopes
###117 so potatoes can grow at the highest altitudes.
###130 And all this is achieved by manpower alone.
###134 Using wooden tools.
###145 In North- and South-America in 1491 farmers grow corn and potatoes to feed their people.
###156 They have none of the domesticated animals that benefit Europe.
###162 For Inca farmers in the Andes
###165 their chief source of meat and transporting goods is the lama.
###170 This is the biggest domestic mammal in the Americas.
###176 The lamas also offered dung for the soil and hides for clothes,
###184 but they can't milk or ride them.
###187 And the animals can't pull a plough so they are no good for farming or for travel.
###196 But their wool is a true blessing.
###208 It is warmer and lighter than sheep's wool.
###213 And produces a greater yield.
###224 The second principal domesticated animal of the Americas is much smaller.
###229 For the Aztecs turkey is vital.
###233 Even today for their descendants in Mexico and Guatemala the turkey is so important
###237 that they dedicate two religious festivals to it.
###248 Native Americans have such few domesticated animals
###252 because the biggest native mammals in the Americas died out long ago.
###262 At the end of the last ice age the megafauna in the Americas, the giant bison and the mastodonts
###267 went extinct.
###269 The reasons for that probably twofold.
###271 First of all as the ice age was ending, the climate came much hotter and drier,
###275 and this killed the vegetation that these original animals depended on.
###279 Secondly the arrival of hunters into North-America crossed over the Bering Strait landbridge from Asia
###286 coincided with the extinction of these animals and very likely these hunters
###289 went after these large animals that were slow and had a lot of meat.
###293 What is left in North-America were animals such as bison,
###298 deer and antelope that are not suited to domestication.
###303 In 1491
###305 native American tribes hunt wild animals to survive,
###310 but the village dwellers in the forests of the north-east and nomads on the planes
###314 developed methods to guarantee their meat supply.
###318 They can't domesticate these animals
###321 so they find a way of making their prey come to them.
###332 In the years before Columbus native Americans
###335 noticed the grass grows better after being burned by lightning strikes.
###342 So they start to burn the prairies and plains themselves.
###347 Many tribes use this technique including the Sioux, Cheyenne, Comanche,
###353 Shoshone and the Blackfeet. America in 1492 was not a pristine wilderness,
###359 that's a romantic myth, it was in many ways a managed landscape.
###363 Natives regularly burnt the forests and the prairie in order to attract the game.
###372 Not only does burning create lush grasslands,
###375 it keeps the forest open and makes hunting easier.
###388 The new rich pastures lured and increased the numbers of herbivores,
###394 as well as the predators that feed on them.
###403 They domesticate the land in order to attract wild animals.
###410 Nomadic central plain Indians are able to lure the biggest mammals in the Americas:
###420 the bison.
###424 Wherever they roam,
###425 bison are the main source of food and clothing and of tools made from their bones.
###438 But still the bison thrive.
###440 By 1491
###442 North-America is home to perhaps thirty million.
###446 They reigned on the prairies from Montana to Texas,
###450 pushed east by native Americans along a path of fire,
###454 opening up the forest to virgin land.
###467 The bison gained a new habitat
###470 far beyond their original range.
###480 Native Americans have no guns or horses.
###484 They hunt on foot.
###491 They dress in hides to get as close as possible
###495 and hunt with a bow and arrow, or spears, all made of wood and leather.
###501 bone and stone.
###517 Hunting the bison is essential for their survival.
###527 In Europe hunting is no longer about survival.
###531 Noblemen hunt for sport,
###533 for pleasure and prestige.
###579 And only the nobles are allowed to hunt.
###583 If ever they catch a peasant hunting he will be punished for poaching.
###593 Unlike in America there's no room here for an abundance of wildlife,
###597 for endless herds.
###607 In Europe the land is man-made.
###609 Agriculture and cities push the wildlife back.
###619 Untamed land is now a rarity, but they have one other major food source.
###631 Fish have long been cheap and abundant for every social class in Europe.
###637 Christianity, the common religion all over Europe in 1491
###641 approves of fish.
###643 Eating meat is banned on more than one hundred days a year.
###647 The demand for fish is huge, but intensive agriculture is damaging the fish supplies.
###667 Once unlimited
###668 supplies in Europe are dwindling fast.
###677 What happened to the fish stocks in Europe?
###681 As people started to grow crops and cut back the wildwoods
###685 this released huge amounts of sediment into the water courses which change them
###690 from being fast clear-flowing rivers and streams into slow turbid rivers and streams
###697 and the freshwater fish found a problem with this, particularly migratory species
###702 that came up from the sea to spawn in the rivers, animals like salmon and sturgeon.
###708 There's another factor which also
###710 cut down the supplies is that these migratory fish and that was that people
###713 started to build dams along rivers and when that happened the migration
###718 runs were blocked and their populations declined.
###726 When supplies of fish dwindled in their polluted lakes and rivers,
###730 they turned to the sea.
###734 For the first time they set up large-scale sea fishing.
###745 They find abundance on a scale never seen before.
###756 And they exploit it.
###760 Cod and herring from the North Sea are the first to be fished.
###764 Every five years catches double.
###770 By 1300
###771 thousands of tons of dried fish are exported from Norway to Britain alone.
###781 But this is 1491
###788 Europe's rivers and lakes are now dirty and empty.
###794 And surroundings seas are fast becoming depleted.
