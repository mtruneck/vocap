###17 CHRIS HARRIS: Couldn't get more American if we tried--
###20 Manhattan skyline and the two muscle cars of the moment--
###24 Camaro ZL1 and Mustang GT500.
###27 Between them, they have 1,259 horsepower.
###31 And yet they cost a lot less than a 997 Turbo S.
###35 So I've got two days with these cars.
###37 I want to drive them in New York, because that's a fun
###39 thing to do.
###39 And then I want to drive them on a circuit.
###40 And then I want to reach some conclusions
###43 about the two of them.
###43 As a European, I'm massively excited.
###46 Because they're so powerful, and they
###47 represent so much value.
###49 Let's get it on.
###51 So is this the worst place on the planet to drive a car?
###55 MALE SPEAKER: To drive?
###55 CHRIS HARRIS: Could be, couldn't it?
###56 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I think so.
###57 CHRIS HARRIS: Could be.
###59 Anyhow, at least I've got a Camaro ZL1.
###64 I suppose I'd better get that straight first, haven't I?
###65 Am I going to call it a ZL1 or a Zed L1?
###68 I suppose, being in America, I ought to call it a ZL1.
###73 Luckily and handily for these purposes, General Motors has
###77 decided to detune the ZR1 Corvette engine
###82 and put it in a Camaro.
###83 And it's only got 588 horsepower.
###87 Get that?
###88 Detuned to 588.
###90 566 foot-pounds of torque.
###92 And I'm going to be able to demonstrate about, oh, seven
###95 of those, I would have thought,
###97 where we're going now.
###99 Initial thoughts, then?
###100 It's not a difficult car to drive slowly, this.
###102 It's not a difficult car at all.
###105 Three petals, clutch is fine, gearbox is light.
###109 We forget that, don't we, that if you had a car with this
###111 much power 15 years ago-- actually, they didn't exist,
###114 did they-- but a mega horsepower car had awful
###117 slackness in the gearshift, and the whole transmission
###119 moved around on rubber mounts and it felt horrible.
###122 This doesn't feel like that.
###123 It's a little bit of slot.
###124 But it's tight.
###125 And it's easy to drive.
###127 
###129 I like the cabin too.
###130 This thing is $48,000 basic.
###133 So it's kind of slightly well-equipped 325i BMW money.
###141 And you get 588 horsepower.
###144 I don't have very good form with New York City.
###147 I've been here once before and I got off the plane, had a
###151 good afternoon, and then the lights went off.
###153 This was August, 2003--
###156 I think it was-- when they had the blackout.
###157 I got stuck here for two days.
###159 I spent $500 to sleep on some stranger's floor one night.
###164 So I don't have much good history.
###165 But I do find it a great place to come on [INAUDIBLE].
###168 And it's good for cars too.
###169 You see some really interesting cars, because
###171 people just seem to use some old, eclectic stuff and leave
###175 it on the street side.
###175 This morning I saw a BMW E28 525e.
###179 I was just cooing all over it.
###181 People thought I was mad.
###181 But it looked so incongruous and cool next to all the other
###184 new, modern cars.
###186 Ah, look.
###187 G63 or G55.
###190 G55.
###194 Are you allowed to drive a G55 if you've not got a Russian
###198 passport and a cocaine habit?
###200 [LAUGHTER]
###202 MALE SPEAKER: Getting a lot of looks around here, though, in
###206 these two cars.
###206 That's for sure.
###208 CHRIS HARRIS: That's what it's all about though, isn't it?
###210 They are partly about being seen and heard, aren't they?
###213 They're pretty good at it too.
###216 I'm at a red light and it's clear road ahead of us.
###221 So the temptation is to make a lot of noise.
###223 But I don't know, is that a bad thing to do in New York?
###225 What's it like in first gear?
###227 [ENGINE SOUNDS]
###230 CHRIS HARRIS: It's quite quick.
###234 I went a bit more than 30 there.
###235 MALE SPEAKER: What's the speed limit here?
###237 CHRIS HARRIS: It's a lovely thing to tool around in.
###239 I like it.
###240 The seat is nice.
###242 They've been quite clever here.
###243 Everything that you touch has got sort of Alcantara on it.
###246 So all the contact points-- there's a stumpy little gear
###247 lever here which looks like it was just
###250 nicked from an M5 actually.
###253 It feels great, because it's all quite a soft touch.
###256 I like this thing.
###257 Strangely when I said I liked it, everyone back at the Drive
###260 office just went, [GROAN], it's a Camaro.
###262 I don't like them.
###263 It's wrong.
###264 They're all very pro-Mustang.
###267 Of course, being a complete foreigner, I don't really
###269 understand the complexities and the subtleties of the Ford
###272 versus Chevrolet thing.
###273 I just want to take them on merit, really, and judge them.
###276 This, to me, feels like a nicely resolved car.
###279 So I'm going to spend a bit of time making sure that it
###282 shifts gear well at low speed, that the
###284 engine's got usable torque.
###286 It may have massive numbers, but it's up to you how much
###289 you use of it.
###291 And that's all I'm going to say about
###293 driving the ZL1 slowly.
###294 Because we need to go and do some stupid stuff with it,
###296 really, don't we?
###300 So this is a Mustang GT500.
###306 Its numbers are so extraordinary, I'm not even
###309 going to mention them now.
###311 I'm just going to sort of settle myself into the beast.
###313 And then we'll discuss the numbers in a minute.
###315 Because they are, frankly, [BLEEP]
###318 ridiculous.
###319 
###323 This is a bit brutal, isn't it?
###325 Jesus.
###326 Talk about a short shift.
###328 
###330 To quote the best motoring journalist cliche of all, it's
###334 like a rifle bolt.
###336 
###341 [BLEEP]
###341 me, that's fast.
###343 It's got loads of grunt.
###346 I feel like I'm sitting in a Range Rover, though.
###347 I'm too high relative to the steering wheel.
###349 If I was to get twirly in oversteer, I could probably
###352 shave my testicles with the bottom of the wheel.
###357 It's actually not the easiest car to drive slowly, whereas
###360 the ZL1 really does just feel to me like any sort of three
###363 pedal, American, fast car.
###365 This is a bit more difficult.
###367 The clutch bite point is high.
###369 Because of this seat being in the wrong position, my angle
###371 of attack from my knee down to the petals is a bit funny.
###374 I'm sitting too high relative to the wheel.
###377 And of course there's that power figure.
###379 We'll come to it now.
###382 671 horsepower.
###387 Say that to yourself.
###388 671 horsepower through, effectively, a live axle.
###393 It's just barking, isn't it?
###395 Who was it who said, sort of post-Lehman that Ford and GM
###399 were going to have to sort their shit out and stop making
###402 muscle cars.
###402 Well, a few years later, we're at the 670
###405 horsepower Mustang mark.
###407 So someone called that wrong, didn't they?
###409 Torque--
###410 631 foot-pounds.
###413 It's a monster.
###414 It's a much, much, more powerful machine than that yob
###417 yellow thing behind me, which itself is crazy enough.
###420 I love it.
###422 And the price of these things-- they are $35 grand
###426 cars if they were sold in the UK at the same price as they
###428 are over here.
###429 So you could have the thick end of 700 horsepower for the
###433 price of a sort of mid-style, three series BMW.
###436 Isn't that something to be celebrated?
###439 When you get to that sort of level, I don't really care
###441 about the way they handle or whether they're as
###443 good as a BMW M3.
###444 It makes no odds whatsoever, does it?
###448 Obviously, I'm a limey tourist here today.
###450 We've driven around New York.
###451 And we've seen a few bits and bobs.
###452 But J.R. said, if there's one place you want to go to, where
###455 would it be?
###457 Times Square, all that stuff-- not really very interested.
###459 I like the Chrysler building, but I've seen that before.
###461 And I've been at the Empire States.
###463 And we're in cars.
###464 But there was one place I wanted to visit, and I've
###466 always wanted to visit ever since I first saw a little
###469 program called The Sopranos.
###471 I wanted to go to the Bing.
###472 Who wouldn't want to go to the Bing?
###474 Not go into the Bing and use its services, obviously,
###476 because I don't need a happy ending as we're speaking now.
###478 But here we are-- the Bing.
###481 [ENGINE REVVING]
###485 CHRIS HARRIS: Boy do these cars get some attention.
###488 They look and sound the part.
###489 And most of Manhattan appears to adore them,
###491 even the local police.
###494 MALE SPEAKER 2: So that's three pull-overs in
###497 literally one hour.
###498 And every time you've gotten out of it.
###501 CHRIS HARRIS: There's something to be said for
###503 mooching and posing in them.
###504 Because they're not actually that good on the open road.
###507 I tell a lie.
###508 That's unfair on the ZL.
###509 The GT500 skips over bumps, the power delivery is pretty
###513 savage, and the exhaust noise is grating.
###515 The ZL is much more composed.
###517 In fact, it's just a nicer fast road car--
###520 quieter and easier.
###522 But do you buy muscle to be easier and quieter?
###527 I don't know.
###528 Let's go to the track and wreck some tires before we
###531 even attempt to answer that one.
###532 
###536 OK, we're at Monticello Motor Club now and finally have the
###538 chance to use some of this massive amount of horsepower.
###541 We're in the ZL1 first, the weakest by some margin.
###546 How often do you say that of a car that has 580 horsepower?
###549 This is quite a heavy brute though--
###551 1,860 kilograms.
###554 So I don't expect, given that it's about 85 degrees outside,
###558 to be able to pound around for too long.
###560 So let's go and do a couple of laps and just
###561 see how the car behaves.
###563 And for me as a European, I have to say, people like me
###568 have quite a jaundiced view of these American performance
###570 cars-- too big, too heavy, and not really on a
###574 par with the Europeans.
###575 But these are quite serious performance cars.
###576 They've got a lot of performance.
###579 
###583 Motor's great.
###584 But it doesn't feel like it's got 580 to me.
###587 Maybe that's because it is so heavy.
###589 Brake pedal-- a little bit blunt.
###592 To me, feels like sort of M3 performance and a bit.
###596 I've got the safety systems on at the moment.
###598 And it's really working hard at the back axle.
###601 We have got oversteer whenever we want it, boys.
###604 Bodes well for [INAUDIBLE].
###607 Do you know what?
###609 As a European, this does not feel at all bad, this thing.
###613 It's not the last word.
###615 But it's pretty good.
###616 It's really pretty good.
###617 
###620 I have to say, initial thoughts--
###623 this car has hugely benefited from having an
###625 independent rear end.
###626 It doesn't feel like the most sophisticated rear end.
###628 But it does feel--
###630 well, I know it goes over bumps in the middle of a
###633 corner and doesn't get spat sideways.
###635 And the chassis is not being completely overpowered by this
###640 engine, not by a long shot actually.
###643 It feels like quite a nice balanced package.
###645 
###653 Yes.
###653 Now we can let it move around a bit.
###654 
###657 But its advantage over the Ford is it's got 305 section
###660 rear tire-- so less power, more mechanical grip.
###663 It's quite a useful recipe, isn't it?
###666 I'm going full power here.
###667 I can't make the thing drift.
###668 
###673 A surprising, slightly strange car we have here, Thomas.
###676 
###682 I'm properly trying to back it in, but it won't do it.
###684 Maybe the ambient temperature isn't helping the old girl.
###687 
###700 Here's a good question to ask yourself
###701 on a Thursday afternoon.
###703 What does 671 horsepower within a body weighing 1,747
###710 kilograms feel like when it's transmitted to the
###712 road via a live axle?
###714 
###717 Welcome to the GT500.
###720 I'm leaving all the systems on to start with.
###724 First thing's first.
###724 This seat--
###725 I'm sitting too high.
###726 I've already got traction issues and I've just used
###729 about a third of throttle.
###730 
###733 Yeah, this is going to be a handful, this thing, isn't it?
###735 What an engine.
###737 So much more powerful than the Camaro engine.
###743 Yeah, this car is dominated by its motor.
###746 It's an engine looking for a chassis.
###749 I'm not convinced it's found it in this
###751 particular car, either.
###752 
###756 Now we caught them-- but the axle is absolutely having a
###761 massive tantrum with itself.
###765 God, it just feels so much faster in a straight line.
###768 Braking--
###769 OK.
###770 Has it got a spool diff on it or something?
###774 It feels like a drift car.
###776 I think it's extraordinary, absolutely extraordinary.
###777 And anyone from my continent that sniffs at it not being as
###782 dignified as an M3 can saw it off, because this is properly
###785 exciting, this thing, properly exciting.
###790 The engine just keeps going.
###793 And rarely has a car said to me, as clearly and as loudly,
###797 please turn the traction control off.
###798 Please turn the traction control off.
###801 
###805 This is a factory car--
###809 670 horsepower.
###811 It's not some tuner nonsense.
###813 This comes with a warranty.
###816 I do like it.
###818 I do like it.
###819 It's crude and it's--
###821 but you know what?
###822 For all that crudity, it's just much more exciting and
###826 much faster than the Camaro.
###829 Where there's no bumps, the live axle isn't as much of a
###832 problem as you'd expect.
###834 But when there are bumps, it's not ideal.
###839 There.
###840 It's making me wait an eternity to get on the gas.
###844 It's so much fun though.
###846 And it's the same price as a loaded up 325i.
###857 These are actually quite different cars.
###859 The Ford is lighter, more powerful,
###861 and generally crazier.
###863 The Camaro is much more rounded.
###866 In as much as I could imagine living with it every day the
###869 way I could, say, an Audi RS or an AMG Mercedes, how you
###873 judge them clearly depends on your Chevy or Ford
###876 affiliation.
###877 But once you've chosen your tattoo, it actually comes down
###879 to what you expect from a modern muscle car.
###883 Because I'm a limey not regularly exposed to this
###885 stuff, I wanted to rip my arms off and scare my children.
###889 And the ZL doesn't do that.
###891 It's too good for that.
###893 Despite giving away power and weight, it was two seconds
###896 faster around Monticello in my hands.
###899 But in the land of muscle, bad is good.
###902 And the GT500 is the baddest of all.
###905 Now how do I import one to the UK again?
###909
